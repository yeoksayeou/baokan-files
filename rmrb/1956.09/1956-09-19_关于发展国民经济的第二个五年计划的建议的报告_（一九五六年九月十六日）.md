The first five-year plan for the development of our national economy will be completed in about a year. To ensure that we can immediately and smoothly begin the construction of the second five-year plan after the completion of the first five-year plan, the Central Committee of the Party believes that it is necessary to start the work of formulating the second five-year plan as early as possible. Now, the Central Committee of the Party has submitted the suggestions for the development of the national economy in the second five-year plan to the Eighth National Congress of the Party for review. After this congress discusses and adopts these suggestions, they will be submitted to the State Council for discussion.

Regarding the basic principles and policies for the development of our national economy in the second five-year plan, these have already been explained in the political report delivered by Comrade Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the Central Committee of the Party. Now, I, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Party, will report to the congress on the suggestions for the second five-year plan.

I. The Situation of the Implementation of the First Five-Year Plan

Before I explain the suggestions for the second five-year plan, I would like to say a few words about the basic situation of the implementation of the first five-year plan.

In the process of implementing the first five-year plan, due to the efforts of the entire nation, especially the working people, our socialist construction and socialist transformation have achieved greater and faster victories than expected. Our achievements are enormous, but there have also been some shortcomings and errors in our work that we must strive to overcome.

In the field of basic construction, by the end of 1957, the total investment in basic construction nationwide is expected to exceed the original plan by more than 10%. Most of the construction units above the planned limit will be able to complete or even complete ahead of schedule. Additionally, several new construction units have been added each year. By the end of 1957, approximately 500 new and renovated industrial enterprises above the planned limit will be completed, thus increasing our country's industrial production capacity, establishing some new industrial sectors, and to a certain extent, renovating some existing sectors. This will begin to change the extremely backward face of our country's industry. After the construction of the first five-year plan, the northeastern industrial base centered around the Anshan Iron and Steel Combined Enterprise will be significantly strengthened, and many new industrial cities will begin to emerge in Inner Mongolia, Northwest, North China, and other regions. Five thousand five hundred kilometers of new and restored railways will be built within five years, with important trunk lines such as Jincheng to Erlian, Baoji to Chengdu already completed, and the railway from Yingtan to Xiamen will also be completed. The important highways such as the Kangding Line and the Qinghai-Tibet Line have also been fully opened to traffic. The completion of these railways and highways has strengthened the connection between the vast regions of Northwest and Southwest China and other regions of the country. Regarding water conservancy projects, we are continuing to control the Huai River, beginning the construction of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy and Hydropower Hub on the Yellow River, and carrying out other large and many medium and small water conservancy projects. Many completed water conservancy projects have already begun to play a role in flood control and irrigation. Over the past few years, geological work has also achieved significant results, ensuring the needs of our country's basic construction. As mentioned above, the basic construction of our country's first five-year plan, in terms of investment and the progress of most important construction units, will be able to meet our predetermined requirements. However, it should also be noted that some sectors may not be able to complete the original investment plan, and some important construction units may not be able to complete the original progress plan. These sectors and construction units should strengthen their work in the next year or so to strive to complete the original plan as much as possible. It should also be noted that some construction units only focus on speed, neglecting quality and safety, resulting in poor engineering quality, many accidents, and waste. This is a lesson to be learned.

In the field of industrial production, the total industrial output value (including modern industry and handicraft industry output value, calculated at constant 1952 prices, the same below) has exceeded the annual plan every year. In 1956, it will reach the level of 1957 as planned in the five-year plan; by 1957, it is expected to exceed the original plan by about 15%. In terms of the output of major industrial products, by 1957, most products will exceed the original planned targets. For example, steel will reach 5.5 million tons, electricity generation will reach 18 billion kilowatt-hours, coal will reach 120 million tons, metal-cutting machine tools will reach 30,000 units, electric power equipment will reach 340,000 kilowatts, logs will reach 24 million cubic meters, cotton yarn will reach 560 million pounds, refined sugar will reach 800,000 tons, and paper will reach 800,000 tons. In terms of important new industrial products, some power generation equipment, metallurgical equipment, mining equipment, and new models of metal-cutting machine tools that our country could not produce before are now being produced; cars and jet aircraft that our country could not produce before are now being produced; large steel and alloy high-quality steel that our country could not produce before are now being partially produced. However, there are a few products, such as oil, sulfur, edible vegetable oil, cigarettes, and matches, due to insufficient raw materials, poor sales, or technical reasons, that may not be able to complete the original production plan.

In the field of agricultural production, in 1953 and 1954, many regions in our country suffered relatively severe natural disasters, and the agricultural production plans for these two years were not fully completed. However, the grain output still increased compared to the bumper year of 1952. In 1955, our country had a bumper harvest of agricultural products, with grain production (excluding soybeans, the same below) reaching 349.6 billion jin, cotton production reaching 30.36 million dan, and other agricultural products also increasing. In 1956, many regions suffered severe disasters such as floods, waterlogging, typhoons, and droughts, and some crops, especially cotton, suffered some losses. However, due to the high tide of cooperation in rural areas nationwide, regions that did not suffer disasters will increase production, and the total grain output for the whole country in 1956 is still expected to reach the level of 1957 as planned in the first five-year plan. As long as there are no major natural disasters or unexpected accidents in the next year or so, the output of major grain crops and some economic crops in 1957 will be able to exceed the original plan. However, the output of soybeans, peanuts, rapeseed, hemp, and some livestock numbers may not be able to complete the original plan, and we must take effective measures to strengthen these weak links.

In the fields of transportation and postal services, with the development of industrial and agricultural production and the expansion of the scale of basic construction, the volume of transportation and postal services has increased every year. It is expected that by 1957, the planned turnover of goods in major transportation sectors will be able to exceed the plan. However, due to the incomplete technical renovation of some existing lines and equipment, some lines and transportation hubs are currently experiencing transportation bottlenecks and even congestion, and efforts are being made to improve this situation.

In the field of commerce, with the continuous development of socialist commerce, a planned and organized market has been formed domestically, and its leading position has been increasingly consolidated. In 1956, compared to 1952, the total value of domestic social commodities will increase by 66.3%, and the total value of imports and exports will increase by 65%. It is expected that by 1957, the planned total retail value of domestic social commodities and the sales volume of most commodities, as well as the planned imports and exports, will be able to be completed, with some even exceeding the plan. Over the past few years, based on the development of production, the turnover of domestic commodities has been expanded, and for the most important few types of daily necessities, the policy of unified purchase and unified sales has been implemented, ensuring the supply of daily necessities for the people, thus basically maintaining price stability and promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of people's living standards. The main shortcomings in commercial work at present are the poor organization of commodity supply and poor management, resulting in the phenomenon of commodities sometimes being overstocked and sometimes out of stock.

In the fields of culture, education, scientific research, and health, these undertakings have all developed considerably over the past few years. It is expected that by 1957, except for a few, higher education, secondary education, primary education, scientific research, news, publishing, broadcasting, literature, arts, film, sports, and medical care will all be able to exceed the original planned targets. For example, by 1957, the number of students in higher education institutions will reach approximately 470,000, exceeding the original target by about 9%; the number of research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences will reach 68, which is 17 more than the original target.

In the field of agricultural and handicraft cooperativization, by the end of June 1956, 992,000 agricultural production cooperatives have been organized nationwide, accounting for 91.7% of the total number of rural households nationwide, of which 62.6% have joined senior cooperatives. The number of organized handicraft workers accounts for about 90% of the total number of handicraft workers. We estimate that after another year or so of work, by the end of 1957, except for a few border regions, agricultural and handicraft cooperativization can be basically achieved nationwide.

In the field of socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, by the end of June 1956, in the capitalist industry, 99% of the output value and 98% of the workforce in enterprises have realized joint state-private ownership; in the private commercial and catering industries, 68% of the total number of establishments and 74% of the total number of employees have been converted into joint state-private stores, cooperative stores, and cooperative groups. The implementation of joint state-private ownership and the fixed interest system in the capitalist industry and commerce has laid the foundation for the nationalization of capitalist means of production.

Here, I would like to briefly describe the improvement of the people's material living standards.

Over the past few years, from an overall perspective, the growth rate of workers' wages has basically been in line with the growth rate of labor productivity. However, there was a period when the growth rate of wages was significantly lower than the growth rate of labor productivity. For example, in 1955 compared to 1954, the labor productivity in the industrial sector (excluding private industry) increased by about 10%, while the average wage of workers only increased by 0.6%. Other sectors had similar situations. This error in work was discovered by us at the end of 1955, and we immediately began to correct it. Starting from April 1956, we implemented a wage system reform nationwide and determined that the average wage of workers in 1956 would be increased by about 13% compared to 1955. Thus, the average wage of workers in 1956 was increased by 33.5% compared to 1952, exceeding the target of a 33% increase in wages over five years as planned in the five-year plan. The growth of labor productivity will also exceed the original plan. For example, in the state-owned industrial sector, labor productivity in 1956 will be increased by 70.4% compared to 1952, exceeding the target of a 64% increase in labor productivity over five years as planned in the five-year plan.

Over the past few years, we have stabilized the agricultural tax burden on farmers and appropriately increased the purchase price of grain, thereby gradually improving farmers' living standards based on the development of production. However, we have also made mistakes. In 1954, due to our failure to fully understand the national grain production situation, we purchased more grain from farmers, causing dissatisfaction among some farmers. In 1955, we implemented the grain policy of fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales, thereby stabilizing farmers' emotions and increasing their production enthusiasm. It is now estimated that farmers' total income will be able to increase by about 30% over five years.

From the above, it can be seen that our country's first five-year plan for national economic development will definitely be successfully completed. As long as we work harder and there are no major natural disasters or unexpected accidents in the future, most of the targets can be exceeded. The implementation and over-fulfillment of the first five-year plan have already and will continue to bring about profound changes in our country's national economy. This is mainly reflected in the significant improvement in the production levels of industry and agriculture. It is expected that by 1957, the total industrial and agricultural output value (including modern industry, handicraft industry, and agricultural output value) will increase by more than 60% compared to 1952. In the total industrial and agricultural output value, the proportion of industrial output value (including handicraft industry output value) will reach about 50%, and in the industrial output value, the proportion of industrial output value for means of production will reach more than 40%, thus strengthening the leading role of industry in the national economy. Due to the decisive victory of the socialist transformation, whether in industry, agriculture, transportation, or commerce, the socialist economic component has already taken an absolute dominant position. With the above changes, all sectors of the national economy have shown a prosperous scene, and the undertakings of culture, education, and scientific research are also entering a period of prosperity, thereby creating conditions for the continuous improvement of people's living standards.

It should be pointed out that the unity and solidarity of all ethnic groups, all democratic parties, and all patriotic individuals under the leadership of the Communist Party of China in socialist transformation and socialist construction have shown great enthusiasm and initiative, which is the foundation and guarantee for our great achievements.

It should also be pointed out that during the implementation of our country's first five-year plan, the great Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries have provided us with tremendous assistance. During this period, the Soviet Union provided our country with preferential loans, helped design 205 industrial enterprises and supplied most of the equipment, sent a large number of outstanding experts, and provided many other technical assistance. Other people's democratic countries also provided us with significant assistance in equipment, materials, and technical strength. The Soviet and other people's democratic countries' experts working in our country have made outstanding contributions to our country's socialist construction. We would like to take this opportunity to express our deep gratitude for the sincere and brotherly assistance of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries.

In the process of implementing the first five-year plan, we have gained a lot of experience and lessons. Learning from these experiences and lessons will enable us to do a better job in socialist construction. Now, I will only mention a few relatively prominent issues that we have felt in leading economic work in recent years and offer some opinions.

First, we should reasonably determine the speed of national economic development based on needs and possibilities, and place the plan on a foundation that is both active and stable and reliable, to ensure the relatively balanced development of the national economy. Since it is difficult to fully anticipate all possible situations and problems that may arise during the implementation of a long-term plan, the indicators of a long-term plan should be set as reliably as possible, and adjustments should be made through annual plans. The indicators of various items in our country's first five-year plan are basically correct. The arrangements for the past four annual plans are generally in line with the specific situation at that time, thus ensuring the over-fulfillment of our country's first five-year plan. However, it should be noted that the plans for 1955 and 1956 partially had the shortcomings of being too low or too high, causing some difficulties in work.

When we formulated the 1955 plan, due to the poor harvest in the previous two years, we set the scale of basic construction relatively small, and during the savings movement that year, we also inappropriately reduced the investment in some non-production basic construction. At the same time, the basic construction plan changed frequently and was issued late, resulting in poor plan completion. As a result, not only did the financial surplus appear excessive, but in important construction materials such as steel, cement, and timber, a temporary false surplus phenomenon also appeared. If we had prepared some reserve projects earlier, expanded the construction scale in time, or planned to increase the reserves of certain materials, the problem of material accumulation could have been solved. However, we underestimated the subsequent development situation, treating the temporary material surplus as a relatively long-term trend, and thus used the method of export to solve the temporary difficulties of surplus steel and cement. Obviously, this was inappropriate.

When we formulated the 1956 plan, due to the bumper harvest of agriculture in the previous year and the great victory of socialist transformation, it was necessary and possible to set the speed of national economic development relatively high. However, we did not properly balance the scale of basic construction and the supply capacity of materials, thus setting the scale of basic construction relatively large. At the same time, some sectors of the national economy also showed the tendency of simultaneous development and impatience for quick results. As a result, not only did the financial situation become relatively tense, but it also caused a serious shortage of materials such as steel, cement, and timber, thus overusing the state's material reserves and creating a relatively tense situation in all aspects of the national economy.

Experience has shown that when we formulate a long-term plan, we should, based on our fundamental requirement to achieve socialist industrialization and the possible conditions of the country's material, financial, and human resources, realistically determine the indicators of various items. At the same time, we should also reserve a certain amount of backup strength to make the plan more reliable. When we formulate an annual plan, we should, based on the possible development conditions of the current year and subsequent years, actively tap potential to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the long-term plan. Experience has also shown that when we formulate an annual plan, in favorable conditions, we must pay attention to the existence of some unfavorable factors in the current and subsequent years and not be impatient and rash; conversely, in unfavorable conditions, we must also pay attention to the existence of many favorable factors in the current and subsequent years and not be hesitant. In other words, we should make a comprehensive analysis of the objective situation and, as far as possible, make a unified arrangement of the main indicators of the current year and the next year to ensure that each year can be mutually connected and develop relatively balanced.

Second, we should combine key construction with overall planning to ensure that various sectors of the national economy can develop proportionally. In the past few years, while we prioritized the development of heavy industry, we adopted the policy of accelerating agricultural cooperativization to promote agricultural production, and correspondingly developed the production of light industry, thus avoiding the danger of mutual disconnection in the development of the major sectors of the national economy.

However, in handling the relationship between key construction and overall planning, we have also made some mistakes. For example, in 1953, some sectors and some places, in the construction work, had the tendency of spreading everywhere, reviving everything, not considering conditions, and blindly rushing forward, which affected the state's key construction and caused financial difficulties and waste of manpower and materials. In early 1956, after the "Outline for the Development of Agriculture in China for 1956-1967" (draft) was published, this tendency occurred again. Some sectors and some places were impatient for quick results, attempting to complete in three, five, or even one or two years what could only be completed in seven or twelve years. These tendencies were all discovered and corrected in time by the Central Committee of the Party.

During this period, another tendency also appeared, that is, some important work was overly prominent, causing it to be disconnected with related aspects. For example, in early 1956, in order to accelerate the development of agriculture, we overestimated the annual demand for double-wheel double-shovel plows and tractor-drawn seeders, and formulated an overly high production plan. Although the plans for these two products were repeatedly revised and production was reduced, the plans were still too high, resulting in the consumption of too much steel, causing the steel supply to be even tighter in 1956, and causing some machinery factories to experience a situation of rushing production and increasing output at one time and idling and reducing output at another time. Again, for example, in our construction, some industrial enterprises, due to advancing too fast, could not fully supply the required raw materials, thus encountering difficulties in fully utilizing production capacity. Of course, in the early stage of our industrial construction, such situations are difficult to completely avoid, but it is not impossible to better arrange in anticipation of such difficulties.

In recent years, in our construction, we have also made appropriate arrangements for the relationship between the central and local governments, coastal regions and inland areas, but we still have shortcomings in this regard. For a period of time, we emphasized the development of central construction, while paying less attention to the development of local construction; we emphasized the development of inland construction, while paying less attention to the development of coastal construction. In the future, we should pay constant attention to adjusting the above relationships and avoiding one-sidedness.

The above explanations show that we emphasize key construction, not to say that we can develop the key independently without overall planning; we advocate overall planning, not to say that we can develop everything simultaneously without ensuring key construction. When we formulate plans and arrange work, we must combine the key and overall well.

Third, we should increase backup strength and improve the material reserve system. In the development of the national economy, imbalances are bound to occur, so it is necessary to maintain necessary backup strength in materials, finance, mineral resources, and production capacity, especially to increase the state's material reserves, to ensure the balanced development of the national economy and the smooth implementation of annual plans, and to cope with possible unexpected difficulties. In the next few years, the impact of natural disasters on our country's agricultural production will still be significant, so to cope with poor harvests, it is necessary to have reserves of grain and major economic crops; to meet the needs of our country's construction and production scale, which is expanding day by day, it is necessary to have reserves of materials and raw materials. In addition, our planning work still lacks experience, and plans often have the shortcomings of being incomplete and inaccurate. Even if the plan is relatively accurate at the time of formulation, it may still produce new imbalances due to unforeseen factors. For example, in 1956, due to the adoption of new technologies, the utilization efficiency of open-hearth furnaces and blast furnaces was improved, resulting in a shortage of ore and coke. To eliminate or reduce the various imbalances that may occur in the implementation of the plan, it is also necessary to reserve necessary backup strength.

Over the past few years, although the state's reserved materials are not many, they have played a certain role in ensuring the needs of production and basic construction, and have also played a certain role in easing the material supply tension in 1956. However, it should be pointed out that we have not fully recognized the importance of material reserves in the past. Just as we mentioned earlier, when some materials were slightly surplus in 1955, we inappropriately exported some of them; in 1956, due to the expansion of the scale of basic construction, we felt a serious shortage of these materials.

It must be recognized that in a country like ours, which is economically backward and has a large population, the shortage of various materials is a common phenomenon for a relatively long period, while the surplus of materials is a temporary phenomenon. Therefore, we need to pay more attention to increasing backup strength, establishing a material reserve system, and reserving necessary materials for the state, especially relatively scarce and important materials. At the same time, each state-owned enterprise should also have appropriate reserves. Of course, whether it is the state's or state-owned enterprises' material reserves, we should strengthen planning, set reasonable quotas, and gradually increase them, not requiring a sudden increase in a large amount, so as not to hinder current production and construction. We should also oppose treating the accumulation of products caused by blind production as the state's material reserves, because this practice will inevitably cause the accumulation and waste of state funds and is not beneficial to production and construction.

Fourth, we should correctly handle the relationship between the economy and finance. Long-term experience has shown that our financial revenue must be based on economic development, and our financial expenditure must first ensure economic development. Therefore, we should first consider the economic development plan, especially the industrial and agricultural production development plan, and then formulate the financial plan based on it to ensure the smooth implementation of the economic plan. Not based on the economic development situation to open up financial sources, to calculate the financial revenue too little, or only from the perspective of saving financial expenditure, to retain too much backup strength, will all limit the full development of economic construction, which is wrong.

When we formulate the financial revenue plan, we must consider the possibility of economic development and the correct proportion between accumulation and consumption to avoid setting the revenue too tightly. When we formulate the financial expenditure plan, in addition to correctly allocating based on the requirements of ensuring key construction and the proportional development of the national economy, we must also consider the balance between the scale of construction and the supply of materials, consider the unexpected needs and leave a certain amount of reserve funds to avoid setting the expenditure too tightly. If we only consider the requirements of construction and do not consider the financial possibilities, do not consider whether equipment, materials, and technical strength can be supplied, and propose overly high and large funding and investment plans, it is obviously wrong.

Comrades often like to discuss whether there should be a "financial framework." Our opinion is that without considering the needs of economic development, subjectively setting a "financial framework" to limit economic development is wrong and should be opposed. However, if the financial plan is in line with the actual situation of economic development, reflecting the correct relationship between accumulation and consumption, the correct relationship between key construction and overall planning, then such a financial plan should undoubtedly be strictly implemented and should not be blindly opposed as a "financial framework."

Here, it should also be pointed out that some shortcomings and errors in our work are inseparable from subjectivism and bureaucratism in leadership. Some leading comrades are aloof, do not approach the masses, do not understand the actual situation, and subjectively handle problems and arrange work, so the decisions made are difficult to be correct and may even be wrong. The bureaucratism of higher-level leaders also fosters the commandism of lower-level leaders.

Now, the organizational structure of the State Council departments is large and has many levels, resulting in many documents, telegrams, and forms, causing lower-level agencies to be busy running around. Some department leaders do not even know what instructions and regulations their department has issued. Such bureaucratic phenomena must be quickly corrected.

In our government's work, although we have achieved great results, we must not be the slightest bit complacent. We should see that our country's national economy is developing rapidly, the situation is changing quickly and frequently, and new problems are constantly emerging, and many problems are interrelated in a complex manner. Therefore, we must constantly approach the masses, get down to the ground, strengthen investigation and research work, grasp the changes in the situation, make specific analyses of favorable and unfavorable factors, and have sufficient estimates of both smooth and difficult aspects, so as to make timely decisions, adjust the activities of various sectors and aspects of the national economy, and avoid the occurrence of mutual disconnection or mutual conflict. In such a vast and complex country, where the economy is undergoing drastic changes, any negligence will inevitably lead to major errors and cause major losses. Therefore, overcoming subjectivism and bureaucratism is of special importance to us.

II. The Basic Tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan

The Central Committee of the Party believes that the formulation of our country's second five-year plan for national economic development should take the achievements that the first five-year plan can possibly achieve as the starting point, link it to the basic requirement that our country should complete the general tasks of the transitional period by approximately the end of the third five-year plan, and realistically estimate the various conditions at home and abroad during the second five-year plan period, and carry out comprehensive planning. Only in this way can the plan be both active and stable and reliable.

The Central Committee of the Party proposes that the basic tasks of our country's second five-year plan for national economic development should be: (1) to continue to carry out industrial construction with heavy industry as the center, promote the technological transformation of the national economy, and establish a solid foundation for the socialist industrialization of our country; (2) to continue to complete the socialist transformation, consolidate and expand collective ownership and public ownership; (3) on the basis of developing basic construction and continuing to complete the socialist transformation, to further develop the production of industry, agriculture, and handicrafts, and correspondingly develop transportation and commerce; (4) to strive to cultivate construction talents, strengthen scientific research work, and adapt to the needs of socialist economic and cultural development; (5) on the basis of the development of industrial and agricultural production, to strengthen national defense, and improve the material and cultural living standards of the people.

The main requirement of our country's socialist industrialization is to basically build a complete industrial system within approximately three five-year plan periods. Such an industrial system can produce various major machinery and equipment and raw materials, basically meeting the needs of our country's expanded reproduction and technological transformation of the national economy. At the same time, it can also produce various consumer goods to appropriately meet the needs of the people's living standards that are constantly improving.

Someone may ask: since the economies of socialist countries led by the Soviet Union are developing and there is the possibility of extensive economic and technological cooperation among socialist countries, does our country still need to build a complete industrial system? We believe that although the current situation of our country is very different from the situation of economic isolation and lack of assistance at the beginning of the Soviet Union's construction, the existence and development of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries are extremely favorable conditions for our country's socialist construction. However, for a country like ours, which has a large population, rich resources, and great needs, it is still necessary to build our own complete industrial system. This is because, from the domestic requirements, we must quickly change the long-term backward state of the national economy; from the international requirements, the establishment of a powerful industry in our country can promote the common prosperity of the economies of socialist countries and can also strengthen the forces to defend world peace. Therefore, the idea of relying on international assistance without the need to build our own complete industrial system is wrong.

Another idea of building behind closed doors is also wrong. It goes without saying that in the long term, our country still needs the assistance of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries to build a complete industrial system, and we also need to develop and expand economic, technological, and cultural exchanges with other countries. Even if we build a socialist industrial country in the future, we cannot imagine that we can close the door and not ask anyone for anything. The facts show that not only will the scope of economic and technological cooperation among socialist countries continue to expand, but also due to the strengthening of the forces of various countries' people striving for peace, democracy, and national independence, the international situation will continue to ease, and our country's economic, technological, and cultural ties with the world will inevitably develop day by day. Therefore, the idea of isolation in building the socialist cause is also wrong.

To establish a solid foundation for the socialist industrialization of our country, during the second five-year plan period, we must continue to expand the construction of the metallurgical industry, vigorously promote the construction of the machinery manufacturing industry, strengthen the construction of the power industry, coal industry, and building materials industry, and actively carry out the construction of backward sectors in industry such as the petroleum industry, chemical industry, and radio industry. At the same time, we must also promote the technological transformation of the national economy, first of all, carry out the technological transformation of industry, to improve the technological level of our country's industry.

Experience has shown that industrial construction with heavy industry as the center cannot and should not be carried out in isolation, it must be coordinated with various aspects, especially with agriculture. Agriculture is an indispensable condition for the development of industry and the entire national economy. Delaying the development of agriculture will not only directly affect the development of light industry and the improvement of people's living standards, but will also greatly affect the development of heavy industry and the entire national economy, and the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. Therefore, during the second five-year plan period, we should continue to strive to develop agriculture and seek the coordinated development of agriculture and industry. To ensure that various sectors and aspects of the national economy develop proportionally and harmoniously, we should also properly arrange the relationship between heavy industry and light industry, industrial and agricultural production and transportation, commodity circulation, economic construction and cultural construction, national construction and people's living standards; at the same time, we should also properly arrange the relationship between the central and local governments, coastal regions and inland areas, and various ethnic groups, to organize all positive factors and useful forces into the great cause of building socialism.

During the second five-year plan period, our country's basic construction and industrial and agricultural production will be able to continue to maintain a relatively fast development speed. The Central Committee of the Party believes that during the second five-year plan period, on the basis of the increase in financial revenue, the proportion of basic construction investment in the total financial revenue will increase from about 35% in the first five-year plan to about 40%, so the total investment in basic construction in the second five-year plan will be about double that of the first five-year plan. In the field of industrial and agricultural production, preliminary calculations show that by 1962, compared to 1957, the total industrial output value will increase by about one fold, among which, the output value of means of production and consumer goods will both increase significantly, but the growth rate of means of production will be faster; the total agricultural output value will increase by about 35%. By 1962, the total industrial and agricultural output value of our country will be about 75% higher than the figure for 1957 as planned in the first five-year plan.

Here, it should be explained that the percentage increases listed in the suggestions for the second five-year plan are all compared based on the planned figures of the first five-year plan, without considering the possible over-fulfillment factors, so the percentage increases appear higher; after the first five-year plan is completed, if the actual figures for 1957 are used as the base, then the percentage increases in the current suggestions may relatively decrease. For example: in the suggestions, it is proposed that the steel production of our country will reach 10.5 million to 12 million tons in 1962, which, compared to the 4.12 million tons planned for 1957 in the first five-year plan, will increase by 1.5 to 1.9 times, but if compared to the current estimated 5.5 million tons for 1957, then the increase will be nearly one fold to 1.2 times.

The above-mentioned scale of basic construction and the speed of industrial and agricultural production development are considered appropriate and both active and stable and reliable. We should believe that as long as we can rely on the masses, tap the masses' enthusiasm and creativity, we will be able to gain great strength, overcome all difficulties on the road ahead, and like the implementation of the first five-year plan, successfully complete the tasks of the second five-year plan.

III. Some Major Issues in the Suggestions for the Second Five-Year Plan

Above, I have explained the basic tasks of the second five-year plan. Regarding the specific principles and indicators of the second five-year plan, these have all been mentioned in the suggestions proposed by the Central Committee of the Party. Here, I will only briefly explain some major issues in the suggestions for the second five-year plan.

(1) Reasonably Accumulating and Allocating Funds

The scale of national construction is mainly determined by how much funds we can accumulate and how to allocate them. If we accumulate more funds and allocate them appropriately, the speed of social expanded reproduction will be faster, and various sectors of the national economy will be able to develop proportionally. Therefore, it is very important to reasonably solve the problems of fund accumulation and fund allocation.

National income is the new material wealth created by the working people of the whole country in the process of production. In a socialist country, all national income belongs to the working people themselves. The working people use part of the national income to maintain and improve their own lives, and use another part for social expanded reproduction, that is, for accumulation. When distributing and redistributing national income, it is necessary to maintain an appropriate proportion between the consumption part and the accumulation part. If the proportion of the consumption part is too small, it will hinder the improvement of people's living standards; if the proportion of the accumulation part is too small, it will reduce the speed of social expanded reproduction. Both situations are not beneficial to the people.

During the second five-year plan period, national income will be able to increase by about 50% compared to the first five-year plan. Since our country's national economy is still backward, agriculture still accounts for a relatively large proportion, and the living standards of the people are still relatively low, therefore, the proportion of the accumulation part in national income cannot and should not have too much and too fast growth, but it can be slightly higher than the level already reached in the first five-year plan. Thus, during the second five-year plan period, the total amount of accumulation will still increase significantly with the growth of national income.

After solving the problem of fund accumulation, we must also solve the problem of fund allocation. Considering the current domestic and international conditions, the Central Committee of the Party believes that during the second five-year plan period, we have the necessity and possibility to appropriately reduce the proportion of national defense and administrative expenses in the state budget, and increase the proportion of economic and cultural education expenditures. The national defense and administrative expenses in the first five-year plan accounted for about 32% of the financial expenditure, and in the second five-year plan, we should strive to reduce it to about 20%. Thus, the proportion of economic and cultural education expenditures will be able to increase from about 56% in the first five-year plan to 60% to 70%, thereby ensuring the rapid development of our country's economic and cultural education undertakings.

When allocating national basic construction investment, we should ensure that industry and agriculture can develop at a relatively high speed. In the total investment, the proportion of industrial investment can be increased from 58.2% in the first five-year plan to about 60%; the proportion of investment in agriculture, water conservancy, and forestry can be increased from 7.6% in the first five-year plan to about 10%. In addition, we should also pay attention to the allocation of investment in transportation and postal services, culture, education, science, and health departments, urban construction departments, and commercial departments, to maintain appropriate proportions.

When allocating industrial investment, we should also properly arrange the relationship between light and heavy industry. In the first five-year plan, due to the great potential of our country's light industry, the plan stipulated that the investment in light industry accounted for 11.2% of the industrial investment, and in the process of implementation, it slightly increased, and such a proportion is appropriate. Considering the gradual improvement of people's consumption levels in the second five-year plan, the production capacity of some light industrial products will be insufficient, we believe that it is necessary to appropriately increase the proportion of investment in light industry. However, due to the fact that the production potential of some light industrial enterprises has not been fully tapped, especially a large number of joint state-private enterprises, after reorganization and arrangement, it is possible to further increase production, and handicrafts, after the realization of cooperativization, will also further increase the production of living consumer goods, therefore, when arranging investment in light industry, we should also consider these factors.

(2) Correctly Arranging the Basic Construction Plan

Regarding basic construction, in addition to the need to reasonably allocate investment as mentioned above, we should also pay attention to the following issues.

First, regarding the strengthening of the construction of the machinery manufacturing industry and metallurgical industry

In the industrial construction with heavy industry as the center, we should pay special attention to the construction of the machinery manufacturing industry and metallurgical industry.

The development of the machinery manufacturing industry is one of the key links in establishing our country's complete industrial system. During the first five-year plan period of our country, many large and precise machines and complete sets of equipment still could not be manufactured, and this situation made about 40% of the machines and equipment needed for our country's construction rely on imports to solve. Therefore, we must strive to develop the machinery manufacturing industry, especially to develop the manufacturing of various large equipment, heavy machinery, precision machinery, and instruments that we need but are lacking, which is a key point for future industrial construction. We should strive to, through the construction of the second five-year plan, increase the self-sufficiency rate of machinery and equipment to about 70%.

The metallurgical industry is the foundation of heavy industry, and without a powerful metallurgical industry, the development of the machinery manufacturing industry is also difficult. During the first five-year plan period, the steel produced in our country only accounted for about 80% of the domestic demand, and many special types of steel were entirely or almost entirely dependent on imports to solve. Therefore, we must strive to develop the metallurgical industry, which is another key point for future industrial construction. We should strive to, through the construction of the second five-year plan, make the quantity and variety of steel and major non-ferrous metals basically meet the needs of various sectors of the national economy, especially the machinery manufacturing industry.

In the various sectors of heavy industry, in addition to the machinery manufacturing industry and metallurgical industry, many weak links need to be strengthened, and many blanks need to be filled, such as the mining and refining of rare metals, the establishment and development of organic synthetic chemical industry, the peaceful use of atomic energy, etc., all should be regarded as important aspects of our construction and given sufficient attention.

To develop heavy industry, we must continue to strengthen geological work and correctly combine geological surveys with key prospecting work, strive to discover more new mineral areas and mineral types, and determine more mineral reserves to meet the current and long-term needs of industrial construction.

Second, regarding the distribution of productive forces

To reasonably allocate our country's productive forces, promote the economic development of various regions, and make the layout of our country's industry adapt to the conditions of resources and national defense, it is necessary to build new industrial bases in the interior in a planned manner. This is an unshakable policy that we must adhere to. Strengthening the new construction of industry in the interior will also promote the economic and cultural development of ethnic minority areas. During the second five-year plan period, we must continue to carry out the construction of industrial bases centered on the steel industry in the Central and Inner Mongolia regions, actively carry out the construction of new industrial bases centered on the steel industry and large hydropower stations in the Southwest, Northwest, and the surrounding areas of Sanmenxia, continue to carry out the construction of the petroleum industry and non-ferrous metal industry in the Xinjiang region, and strengthen geological work in the Tibet region to prepare conditions for the development of Tibet's industry.

At the same time, we must make full use of the existing industrial base in the coastal areas. The original industrial base in the coastal cities is needed for the industrial construction we are carrying out in the interior, and it is also needed for the supply of raw materials and equipment, technical personnel, and funds. It can be said that the original industrial base in the coastal areas is the starting point of our country's industrialization. We make full use of and strengthen the industrial base in the coastal areas, not only to meet the needs of the country and the people that are increasing day by day, but also precisely to establish a stronger industrial base in the interior. During the second five-year plan period, we should continue to strengthen the industrial base in the Northeast, make full use of and appropriately strengthen the industry in the coastal cities of East China, North China, and South China, to give full play to their role in national construction.

Of course, when we make full use of the original industrial base in the coastal cities, we should pay attention to rationality and avoid blindness. This rationality is: to renovate those enterprises that have the necessity and possibility to be renovated, not to renovate all existing enterprises; in cities where industrial enterprises are already relatively numerous, generally fewer new enterprises should be built; new and renovated enterprises must pay attention to the source of raw materials, the sales of products, production technology, and transportation conditions, and pay attention to the reasonable division of labor with other regions.

In the problem of the distribution of industrial locations, whether it is the industry in the interior or the industry in the coastal areas, our policy is to be appropriately dispersed and mutually coordinated, opposing both excessive concentration and mutual disconnection.

With the reasonable distribution of industrial productive forces, we will build many new cities and expand many existing cities, for this, we should strengthen the planning and construction of cities to coordinate with industrial construction.

Third, regarding the combination of large enterprises and medium and small enterprises

Many large-scale industrial enterprises that we have started construction during the first five-year plan period and will start construction during the second five-year plan period are the backbone of our country's complete industrial system. However, while constructing large enterprises, we must also construct many medium and small enterprises to be able to produce more industrial products in a shorter time, to meet the needs of national construction and people's lives.

Some people think that constructing large enterprises is more reasonable in terms of economy and technology, so we should build more large enterprises and fewer medium and small enterprises. Others think that constructing medium and small enterprises requires less time and has a faster effect on investment, so we should build more medium and small enterprises and fewer large enterprises. We believe that it is not possible to generalize, in some industrial sectors and under certain conditions, constructing large enterprises is reasonable, while in other industrial sectors and under other conditions, constructing medium and small enterprises is more reasonable. In each type of enterprise, generally speaking, there should be some large enterprises as the backbone, and there should also be many medium and small enterprises to coordinate.

To make the construction of enterprises more reasonable, for large enterprises that have the necessity and possibility to be constructed in stages, we can consider constructing in stages; for medium and small enterprises that have surplus resources and other conditions, we can carry out overall planning and make preparations for future development. At the same time, when planning medium and small enterprises to coordinate with large enterprises, we should first make use of existing state-owned and joint state-private medium and small enterprises and handicrafts to tap their production potential.

(3) Developing Industrial Production

Our country's first five-year plan stipulates that by 1957, compared to 1952, the total industrial output value (including handicraft industry output value) will increase by 90.3%; the Central Committee of the Party proposes that by 1962, compared to the original plan for 1957, the total industrial output value should increase by about one fold. During the second five-year plan period, the total industrial output value can maintain a relatively high growth rate because: the newly built and renovated enterprises that have been put into production will increase, most existing enterprises will adopt production-increasing technical measures or carry out technological transformation, joint state-private enterprises will complete economic reorganization and basically realize nationalization, handicrafts, except for a few, will complete cooperativization, and at the same time, agricultural development will also be able to maintain a relatively high speed.

Regarding the development of industrial production, I will only talk about the following few issues here.

First, regarding the issue of tapping the production potential of industrial enterprises

In our country's total industrial output value, according to rough calculations, by 1957, the output of newly built and renovated enterprises will account for about 15%; while by 1962, the output of newly built and renovated enterprises completed in the first and second five-year plans will account for about 50%. Therefore, strengthening organizational work and fully tapping the role of this type of enterprise is of great significance for the development of industrial production.

Title: On the Draft of the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy

Author:

Date: 1956-04

Page: 1

The new and reconstructed enterprises, especially the heavy industrial enterprises, require a certain period from the start of production to reach the designed production capacity, during which time technicians and workers need to master the performance of machines and equipment and familiarize themselves with the technological processes. However, if we can fully mobilize the enthusiasm and wisdom of technicians, workers, and staff, this period can be shortened, and in some cases, the designed production capacity can even be exceeded. According to statistics from April 1956, out of 141 industrial construction projects that started production between 1953 and 1955, 30 had already reached and exceeded their designed capacity ahead of schedule, 33 could reach their designed capacity ahead of schedule, 71 could reach their designed capacity on schedule, and only 7 could not reach their designed capacity on schedule. This means that nearly half of the enterprises can shorten the time to reach their designed capacity. Examples include the reconstructed Shenyang Wind Tools Factory, which was originally estimated to take four years to reach its designed capacity but actually achieved it in the second year of operation, with the production volume in 1957 expected to exceed the designed capacity by more than onefold. The newly built Fushun Aluminum Plant, which started production in early 1955, already reached approximately 110% of its designed capacity in that year. This shows that new and reconstructed enterprises have significant production potential. To fully tap this potential, the primary task is to strengthen production preparation, especially in personnel training, technical preparation, organizational coordination, and raw material supply. Relevant departments should study, summarize, and promote specific experiences in this regard.

However, we must not neglect the production of existing enterprises just because we have new and reconstructed enterprises. During the second five-year plan period, the output value of existing enterprises will still account for a significant proportion of the total industrial output. Moreover, many new and reconstructed enterprises still need the cooperation and support of existing enterprises. We should adopt different measures based on specific conditions, reconstruct or technologically upgrade some enterprises, adjust and add certain equipment to others, and continue to improve the management of the remaining enterprises to further tap the production potential of existing enterprises.

Second, regarding the promotion of industrial production specialization and cooperation:

Promoting the specialization and cooperation of industrial production, especially heavy industrial production, can improve labor productivity, reduce production costs, and promote technological development. However, industrial production specialization and cooperation are relatively complex issues that need to be gradually and separately resolved over a considerable period, in line with the improvement of China's industrial level and in combination with China's specific conditions and possibilities. We cannot proceed blindly or forcibly. During the first five-year plan period, on the one hand, we fully utilized the role of existing comprehensive factories to make their production adapt to the multifaceted needs of national construction and people's lives. On the other hand, in the machinery manufacturing industry, we began to establish some specialized factories according to product categories and adjusted some machine factories with overly complex product categories, enabling these enterprises to initially move towards specialization. This was entirely necessary. During the second five-year plan period, in addition to building some specialized factories, we should reasonably arrange the product plans for various new and reconstructed enterprises, avoiding the drawbacks of overly complex product categories and inappropriate pursuit of specialization. For existing enterprises, on the one hand, we should appropriately adjust the product plans of some enterprises to make production more reasonable. On the other hand, we should still retain some comprehensive factories. For most joint state-private enterprises, we should allow them to continue with their original product categories to meet the diverse needs of society and the cooperation needs of state-owned enterprises. Within an industrial area or city, we can organize the specialized production of certain forgings, castings, and standard parts based on needs and possibilities. In the process of promoting industrial production specialization, we should prevent the tendency of reducing product categories.

As industrial production gradually moves towards specialization, the task of cooperation becomes increasingly heavy and complex. Therefore, we must further correct the tendency of wanting to operate independently without cooperating. Enterprises that must and can cooperate should have specific cooperation tasks and contracts stipulated in their annual plans.

Third, regarding the improvement of product quality and the increase of product varieties:

The quality of many industrial products, especially certain light industrial products, is not high, and the varieties are not many, which has become a prominent issue in industrial development and has had a negative impact on national construction and people's lives. There is no doubt that the quality of many of our heavy industrial products and light industrial products has been continuously improving, and the varieties have been continuously increasing. However, not all industrial products are like this, and even some products have seen a decline in quality and a reduction in varieties. This phenomenon must be vigorously corrected.

The low quality and few varieties of industrial products are indeed largely due to China's low technological level and backward equipment. However, this does not mean that we have no way to improve the quality of China's industrial products and increase the varieties of industrial products, nor can we use this as an excuse for the decline in quality and the reduction in varieties. Some industrial departments have not paid due attention to product quality and product varieties, lacking long-term planning and effective measures; when checking the implementation of plans, they often focus on checking the completion of production volume plans while neglecting the completion of quality plans and new product variety production plans; there are rewards for exceeding production volume plans, but there are no rewards for improving quality and increasing varieties. All these are important reasons for the current low quality and few varieties of China's industrial products. In addition, in the case of light industrial products, factories' finished products were previously purchased and sold by the commercial department; good quality and poor quality, new products and old products were all priced the same or with very little difference. These systems and methods have also encouraged enterprises to neglect product quality and product varieties. Therefore, during the current period and the second five-year plan period, each industrial department should formulate long-term development plans for industrial technology, actively organize product design forces, and strengthen the leadership of new product design and trial production work. Strengthen the technical management work of enterprises, improve the supply of raw materials, implement the product quality reward system; especially, we should mobilize the broad masses of workers to strive for improving product quality and increasing product varieties. At the same time, the commercial department should gradually implement the selective purchase system and the price differentiation system based on quality.

Fourth, regarding the development of agricultural production:

The Central Committee of the Party proposed in the draft of the second five-year plan that the total grain production over five years should reach approximately 220 billion jin, with 500 billion jin in 1962; the total cotton production over five years should reach approximately 2.1 billion dan, with 4.8 billion dan in 1962. The total agricultural output value in 1962 should increase by approximately 35% compared to 1957. These targets are proposed considering the following two aspects: on the one hand, except for a few areas, agricultural cooperativization will be completed, allowing us to further implement the measures and experiences for increasing production as stipulated in the "Outline for the Development of Agriculture in China (1956-1967) (Draft)," and to expand irrigation areas and cultivated land, increase the supply of chemical fertilizers, and improve production tools and cultivation techniques, all of which will promote the further development of agricultural production. On the other hand, various natural disasters are still unavoidable, many seriously harmful rivers have not been treated, large-scale land reclamation work has not been fully launched, and the conditions for agricultural mechanization have not been met, all of which make us unable to demand a higher speed for agricultural production development. Of course, we should fully utilize the aforementioned favorable conditions to strive for greater development of agricultural production during the second five-year plan period.

Regarding the development of agricultural production, we should pay special attention to the following two issues.

First, regarding the improvement of agricultural crop yield per unit area:

The main approach to agricultural increase during the second five-year plan period in China is to, based on cooperativization, rely on the enthusiasm of farmers to gradually improve agricultural production technology, develop water conservancy, increase fertilizers, promote advanced experiences, etc., to improve the yield per unit area. When implementing various increase measures, we must adopt the principle of combining national work with cooperative work.

Regarding water conservancy development, on the one hand, the state and local governments should undertake several large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, such as the comprehensive treatment of the Yellow River, Huai River, Hai River, and local flood control and waterlogging prevention projects. On the other hand, cooperatives should undertake a large number of small water conservancy projects, improve existing water conservancy facilities, and strengthen water and soil conservation work. In low-lying and waterlogged areas, we should study and implement various waterlogging and drainage measures, change cultivation systems to reduce the harm of internal waterlogging.

Regarding the increase of fertilizers, on the one hand, the state should actively develop the fertilizer industry and strive to import more chemical fertilizers to increase the supply of fertilizers. On the other hand, and more importantly, cooperatives and individual members should widely engage in pig raising and manure accumulation, and in some places, sheep raising and manure accumulation, and manufacture green manure and accumulate other natural fertilizers.

Regarding the promotion of various technological measures and advanced increase experiences, we should actively carry out technical guidance work, on the one hand, absorb and promote advanced increase experiences from outside, and based on scientific experiments and research results, implement them in a way that suits local conditions. On the other hand, we should also actively summarize and promote local advanced increase experiences.

Here, we must especially point out that the promotion of technological improvement measures and the promotion of advanced experiences must be carried out in an active yet cautious manner. In recent years, significant achievements have been made in this work, but in some places, there have been issues of mechanical transplantation and even forced promotion, resulting in negative outcomes. In the future, any increase measures and advanced experiences must first be proven effective through experiments before being gradually promoted, and when promoting them, appropriate implementation steps must be regulated based on the specific conditions at that time and place. At the same time, when promoting these measures and experiences, we should also seek the opinions of local farmers, especially experienced elderly farmers, and should not forcefully promote them. We should not arbitrarily negate local cultivation habits.

Second, regarding the development of diversified agricultural economy:

Grain is the foundation for ensuring people's lives and the development of the entire agricultural economy, and we must pay sufficient attention to it. In recent years, various places have emphasized the increase of grain and cotton production, which is entirely necessary. However, some places have neglected other agricultural economies—various economic crops other than cotton, animal husbandry, forestry, aquaculture, sericulture, and various sideline occupations of farmers—due to this emphasis. Coupled with the fact that some agricultural products and local specialties have been affected by low purchase prices, the result is that the agricultural economy cannot develop fully and adequately, thereby affecting the development of the entire national economy and the income of farmers. Therefore, each place, and even every agricultural production cooperative, should, based on the historical situation and current situation, natural conditions, economic and technical conditions, farmers' production habits, and living habits, etc., plan the development of agriculture comprehensively to avoid the tendency of single-mindedness and one-sidedness. In pastoral areas, forest areas, and aquaculture areas, we should plan respectively with animal husbandry, forestry, or aquaculture as the center, and based on possible conditions, develop agriculture and other sideline occupations.

To promote the comprehensive development of the agricultural economy, we must take some specific measures. All production that farmers have the habit of operating and that is needed by society should be continued and developed. All products that are urgently needed by society, especially those with significant economic value, such as subtropical and tropical crops, various agricultural products and by-products needed for export, should, in addition to being operated by the state or local governments, also be encouraged to be operated by cooperatives, with the state providing technical guidance. All sideline occupations that are not necessary for cooperatives to operate uniformly should be encouraged for individual members to operate. The commercial department should reasonably regulate the purchase prices of agricultural products and sideline products and improve the purchase system. At the same time, relevant departments should help cooperatives appropriately restore some agricultural product processing industries in rural areas.

Fifth, regarding the development of transportation and postal services:

During the second five-year plan period, with the development of industrial and agricultural production and the expansion of the scale of basic construction, the opening up and construction of inland and remote areas will require a significant increase in transportation and communication capacity. This requires us to, with railways as the key, correspondingly carry out the construction of the national transportation and communication networks. This puts forward enormous demands on the transportation and postal departments: on the one hand, we should carry out necessary reconstruction and technological transformation of existing lines and equipment. On the other hand, we should continue the construction of new lines, mainly the construction of railways and highways in the northwestern and southwestern regions, and the construction of ports along the coast and the Yangtze River. At the same time, we should also increase the necessary transportation and communication equipment. The transportation and postal departments should, based on the aforementioned two aspects of demands, plan comprehensively according to the priority and urgency, to ensure the completion of various tasks proposed in the draft of the second five-year plan regarding transportation and postal services.

Currently, some lines have already shown signs of tension in transportation and communication, which is mainly due to insufficient equipment capacity. However, we should also see that some transportation and communication lines and equipment still have certain potential capacities that have not been tapped. Therefore, the transportation and postal departments should also actively take effective technical measures and strengthen the organization of transportation and communication work.

Due to the insufficient modern transportation tools and uneven distribution of transportation lines in China, and the large number and wide distribution of traditional transportation tools such as wooden sailboats and animal-drawn carts in China, these traditional transportation tools will still be important auxiliary transportation forces for a considerable period, and in some areas, they are still the main transportation forces. Therefore, we should fully utilize and appropriately develop traditional transportation tools and gradually carry out technical improvements on them. Under possible conditions, we should also combine modern transportation tools with traditional transportation tools to meet the growing needs of transportation.

Sixth, regarding the strengthening of commercial work:

Improving people's lives requires not only increasing people's monetary income but also ensuring that they can buy a certain quantity of and suitable commodities. According to rough calculations, the total retail sales of various daily necessities and some means of production for urban and rural people in 1962 will increase by approximately 50% compared to the original plan for 1957. This is a heavy task for the commercial department. The commercial department must continue to strengthen procurement and sales work, continue to implement the policy of unified purchase and sale of major daily necessities, reasonably set up commercial networks, and organize a part of the free market under state leadership in a planned manner to meet the growing needs of the people. Regarding foreign trade, we should organize the export of relevant materials in a planned manner to ensure the import of equipment and materials necessary for national construction.

Commercial work, as a link between production and consumption, industrial production and agricultural production, not only undertakes the task of meeting the living needs of residents and a part of production needs and the task of accumulating funds for the state, but also undertakes the task of promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production. Since the law of value still plays a certain role in China's economic life and plays an important role in some aspects, correctly using the law of value and correctly grasping the price policy can promote the development of industrial and agricultural production.

During the first five-year plan period, the prices in China's market were generally stable, and the price ratio between industrial products and agricultural products was generally appropriate, which shows that our price policy was correct. It promoted the development of industrial and agricultural production and national construction and ensured the smooth progress of socialist transformation. However, there were still some shortcomings and errors in the implementation of the price policy, mainly: some agricultural products and local specialties had purchase prices set too low, or sometimes high and sometimes low, affecting the increase of these products, and even causing a reduction in some products; the price difference between some light industrial products in terms of quality and variety was too small, affecting the improvement of the quality and increase of the varieties of these products. These shortcomings have been discovered and are being gradually corrected, but they have not been completely overcome and need further study and adjustment.

Correctly grasping the price policy is a very complex matter. In a country with a large population and complex economic conditions like ours, the adjustment of prices must be done with great caution and cannot be done lightly. For example, inappropriate increases in the purchase prices of agricultural products will have adverse effects on industrial production and workers' lives, and on maintaining the correct development ratio between various agricultural products; inappropriate reductions in the sales prices of industrial products may cause shortages of commodities. Therefore, such inappropriate price increases or reductions will not be conducive to the development of industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of people's lives. During the second five-year plan period, we will continue to adopt a stable policy in terms of prices, while also making necessary and appropriate adjustments to some unreasonable prices.

Due to the victory of the socialist transformation, socialist economy has occupied an absolute dominant position in China, which makes it possible for us to better use the law of value within an appropriate scope to influence the production of those industrial and agricultural products that are not necessary for the state to purchase and sell uniformly, have small output value, and have many varieties, to meet the diverse needs of people's lives. To adapt to the aforementioned situation and prevent the occurrence of excessive and rigid unification that affects the reduction of product quality and varieties, now and during the second five-year plan period, we will take many important measures in the commercial sector. For example, under the leadership of the state unified market, we will organize a part of the free market in a planned manner; within a certain scope, we will implement the self-production and self-sale of products; for some daily-use industrial products, we will promote the selective purchase and price differentiation system based on quality, etc. Taking these measures will not only not damage the state unified market but will also play a beneficial supplementary role for the state unified market.

Seventh, regarding the reorganization of enterprises and personnel arrangements during the socialist transformation process:

In the work of socialist transformation, I will only talk about the following two issues.

First, regarding the reorganization of medium and small joint state-private enterprises and handicraft and small commercial cooperative organizations:

Large joint state-private enterprises, because they have been in operation for a relatively long time, have gradually brought their production and operation into the track of national planning, and their management systems have generally undergone initial transformation. However, a large number of scattered medium and small new joint state-private enterprises still need appropriate reorganization and arrangement. Many individual handicraftsmen and small traders, after achieving cooperativization, also need necessary reorganization and arrangement. Only in this way can they operate and manage production under relatively reasonable conditions and gradually adapt to the requirements of national planning management. However, when reorganizing them, we must pay attention to preventing and correcting the tendency of over-concentration.

Regarding the industrial sector, small factories indeed have their drawbacks, but they are more flexible and adaptable in production and operation, making it easier to meet diverse and constantly changing needs. Therefore, all small factories that are reasonably operated and can meet social needs should be retained and not hastily merged or eliminated. Handicraft cooperative organizations generally should not be overly concentrated and should, based on the principles of developing production, meeting social needs, and increasing members' income, allow large cooperatives, small cooperatives, and small groups to coexist. Certain manufacturing industries, especially many repair and service industries, should be allowed to continue their scattered activities and original operational characteristics to directly serve residents and to absorb family auxiliary labor to participate in production. Some handicrafts can continue to produce independently under the leadership of handicraft cooperative organizations, or they can completely self-produce and self-sell and do not need to be forcibly organized.

Regarding the commercial sector, the distribution of commercial institutions should maximize the convenience for residents. Therefore, they should not be overly concentrated but should be appropriately dispersed and adopt diverse operational methods to serve residents. Our commercial leadership departments have often considered their own management convenience more than how to convenience residents, resulting in the tendency of over-concentration, and inappropriate merging and elimination of some small shops and small traders. This tendency should be quickly corrected. In the future, whether in urban residential areas or vast rural areas, we should maintain a certain number of small shops and small traders, adopting cooperative stores, cooperative groups, agency sales, and even completely self-purchase and self-sale, etc., to better serve residents.

Second, regarding the arrangement and transformation of industrial and commercial capitalists and small business owners:

After the realization of joint state-private operation in industrial and commercial capitalism, we should cultivate and promote outstanding workers to participate in enterprise leadership and at the same time absorb the original industrial and commercial capitalists and small business owners to undertake a part of the operational and leadership work. After the implementation of joint state-private operation and the fixed interest system, capitalist elements in enterprises have the dual identity of capitalists and employees. Therefore, state capital representatives should cooperate well with these capitalists, utilize their strengths and enthusiasm, and in the process of work, strengthen their education and transformation, overcome their capitalist ideology and style, help them achieve results in work, and gradually transform them into genuine laborers, rather than adopting a discriminatory attitude towards them. Doing so is beneficial to enterprises, the state, and the working class. To do this work well, we should make the workers in enterprises understand this principle and regard the unity, education, and transformation of capitalists as an important task.

In tens of thousands of capitalists in joint state-private enterprises, the vast majority have some production technology or operational management experience, and some have relatively high production technology and relatively rich operational management experience. We must fully utilize their production technology and useful operational management experience. State capital representatives should learn well from them in this regard.

Eighth, regarding the improvement of the state administrative system and the mobilization of local initiatives:

During the second five-year plan period, many national construction projects will be more undertaken by local governments or will require the efforts of local governments to complete. Therefore, mobilizing local initiatives is an important condition for the completion of socialist construction projects.

Now, the socialist transformation in China has achieved decisive victories, and people's democratic dictatorship has been further consolidated, which makes it necessary and possible for us to, based on the principle of unified leadership, hierarchical management, and suitability to local conditions and specific circumstances, further delineate the administrative powers of the central and local governments and improve the state administrative system to fully mobilize local initiatives. The State Council held a national system conference from May to August this year, which examined the current phenomenon of excessive centralization of power and discussed the improvement of the state administrative system, and proposed a draft resolution on the improvement of the state administrative system, which is now being widely solicited for opinions from all parties.

When delineating the administrative powers of the central and local governments, the following principles should be followed: (1) clearly stipulate that provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government have certain scopes of planning, financial, enterprise, institutional, material, and personnel management powers; (2) enterprises and institutions that are related to the entire national economy and have overall, key, and centralized characteristics should be managed by the central government; other enterprises and institutions should be handed over to local governments as much as possible; when enterprises and institutions are handed over, the related planning, financial management, and personnel management should generally be handed over together; (3) the management of enterprises and institutions should seriously improve and promote the dual leadership management method of central leadership with local assistance or local leadership with central assistance, and strengthen the leadership of enterprises and institutions; (4) the main planning and financial indicators managed by the central government should be uniformly issued by the State Council, changing the previous practice of many main indicators being issued by various departments; (5) certain main planning indicators and personnel quotas should leave a certain adjustment margin and flexibility for local governments; (6) the autonomous rights of ethnic autonomous areas should be specifically implemented, and attention should be paid to helping the political, economic, and cultural development of ethnic minority areas; (7) the improvement of the system should be gradually implemented, and major changes should be carried out in steps, such as preparation this year, trial implementation next year, and full implementation during the second five-year plan period, to proceed steadily.

To effectively implement the aforementioned principles, we believe that the key issue is to appropriately expand the powers of local governments under the unified leadership of the central government. Because local governments are closer to the basic units of enterprises and institutions and closer to the masses, they are more familiar with the actual situation. Appropriately expanding the powers of local governments can better mobilize all forces and positive factors in local areas to participate in socialist construction projects.

To further mobilize local initiatives and strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups in the country, now and during the second five-year plan period, we should pay more attention to ethnic minority work. All areas where ethnic minorities reside should establish autonomous regions that have not yet been established according to the Constitution and actively help them establish autonomous regions. The various autonomous rights of autonomous regions should be strictly respected. A large number of ethnic minority cadres should be cultivated and promoted, and their political awareness and management capabilities in various matters should be continuously improved, so that they can truly take charge and have the right to do so in work. Whether in ethnic minority concentrated, mixed, or scattered areas, their national equality rights, religious freedom, customs, and languages should be respected. For those ethnic minorities that do not have their own script or have incomplete scripts, we should actively help them create and reform their own ethnic scripts.

Ninth, regarding the cultivation of construction talents and the strengthening of scientific research work:

During the second five-year plan period, to establish a solid foundation for socialist industrialization and to carry out national construction and technological transformation of the national economy, we must strive to cultivate construction talents and strengthen scientific research work.

First, regarding the cultivation and allocation of construction talents:

Cultivating various construction talents for the country, first and foremost industrial and technical talents and scientific research talents, is the primary task of education work. In recent years, China's work in cultivating construction talents has made significant progress, but from the perspective of national construction needs, the number of talents cultivated in colleges and universities and secondary specialized schools, especially in quality and categories, still cannot meet the needs. Therefore, during the second five-year plan period, we should further develop higher education and secondary specialized education and, based on the principle of "focusing on key areas and considering others" and combining needs with possibilities, carry out comprehensive planning.

To do a good job in cultivating construction talents, we must correctly handle the relationship between quantity and quality. In recent years, we have had the tendency to emphasize quantity and neglect quality, which must be corrected. From the perspective of the education department, we should actively mobilize forces to increase the number of students under the condition of ensuring a certain quality. From the perspective of the personnel department, we should consider the actual needs and possibilities and not propose overly high requirements to avoid reducing the quality of students due to blindly increasing the number.

Higher education and secondary specialized education should realistically and not subjectively adjust the departments and set up specialties, and practically improve the teaching plans, syllabi, textbooks, and teaching methods to make the cultivated talents better adapt to the specific needs of various departments of the national economy. Currently, the biggest difficulty in developing and improving higher education and secondary specialized education is the lack of teachers and the low quality of students. Therefore, we must select an appropriate number of outstanding graduates from colleges and universities to cultivate more postgraduates and send graduates and teachers of colleges and universities abroad to study the subjects we lack, to increase the number of teachers. At the same time, we must correspondingly develop and run well senior high schools and junior high schools to improve the quality of students. The existing books and instruments in colleges and universities are generally still insufficient and should be gradually supplemented; the necessary buildings for these schools in their development should also be solved.

Cultivating construction talents also requires the development of adult education to absorb those with conditions for further study from workers to study in evening schools or correspondence schools and gradually cultivate them into senior and intermediate specialized talents. Learning must be truly voluntary and should be carried out in batches and phases; various units should guarantee the necessary study time for learners, and the study time should not be too long, and the study should not be too tight, to avoid affecting production and the health of workers.

In the context of insufficient scientific and technical talents, the rational allocation of construction talents is even more important. When allocating construction talents, the needs of production, construction, and scientific research, and the increase of teachers should be guaranteed first, while considering other aspects; and we should continue to correct the phenomenon of improper allocation of scientific and technical talents, using them for non-specialized purposes, and wasting talents.

Second, regarding the strengthening of scientific research work:

Recently, under the direct leadership of the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council, hundreds of outstanding scientists from across the country have been gathered to draft the twelve-year national scientific and technological development plan and the philosophy and social sciences development plan, respectively proposing the most important research tasks in natural sciences and social sciences. This is an extremely important measure to improve scientific research work and ensure that many important aspects of science and technology in China can approach the advanced level of the world in the next twelve years. This should be completed under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council as soon as possible, and the national scientific research forces should be organized to implement the tasks proposed in these two plans in a phased manner. Due to the heavy tasks of science and technology that need to be solved, the insufficient number of existing scientific research talents, and the rapid development of modern science and technology, and because the current focus of China's scientific research is mostly our weak links in work, and even gaps, we should concentrate our efforts to first solve the problems in important aspects and prevent the tendency of starting everything at once and evenly using forces.

To strengthen scientific research work, we must gradually establish and improve the scientific research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and various business departments, strengthen the scientific research work of colleges and universities, and achieve division of labor and cooperation among various aspects and close integration. The establishment of scientific research institutions should seek a reasonable distribution in regions. Scientific research work should be closely integrated with the various construction projects of the state, especially economic construction projects. In scientific research, the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" should be implemented, and academic freedom should be encouraged to fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of scientific research personnel.

To develop China's scientific research work, we should also timely solve the problems of necessary books, materials, instruments, and experimental sites, actively improve the working conditions of scientific research personnel, and further strengthen international scientific exchanges and cooperation, and collect and exchange scientific and technological information at home and abroad.

Tenth, regarding the further improvement of people's lives:

During the second five-year plan period, based on the development of production and the increase of national income, we have the possibility to further improve people's lives.

Fundamentally, all the construction projects carried out by our country are for the welfare of the people. However, in the process of construction, it is often difficult to arrange the long-term interests of the people and the current interests, and the collective interests and individual interests. Therefore, we must properly arrange the ratio of accumulation and consumption in national income, while ensuring the gradual expansion of the scale of national construction, to gradually improve people's lives.

Here, I would like to emphasize the following issues:

First, regarding the improvement of workers' material lives:

During the second five-year plan period, the average wage of workers will increase by 25% to 30%. Such a growth rate is in line with China's economic development level and the growth rate of labor productivity. Based on the aforementioned experience, we must pay attention to maintaining the appropriate ratio between wage growth and labor productivity growth in the annual plan to make the wage level of workers rise relatively evenly with the improvement of labor productivity. And when formulating the annual wage growth plan for workers, we should also consider the production and supply possibilities of daily necessities to avoid the phenomenon of wage growth and material supply becoming decoupled.

To improve the material lives of workers, in addition to further raising the wage level of workers, now and during the second five-year plan period, we should also, based on possible conditions, take practical measures to gradually improve the conditions of workers' housing, safety, medical and health, and appropriately increase other welfare facilities. In this regard, the State Council has formulated several specific measures and will soon announce their implementation.

We should continue to oppose the bureaucratic attitude of indifference to workers' lives. In fact, many facilities to increase workers' welfare have not been implemented, not entirely because of the lack of financial and material conditions, but mainly because some leading officials of relevant departments have adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards the improvement of workers' lives. It should be pointed out that some welfare undertakings do not require increasing the national budget expenditure and can be implemented. As long as we can overcome the bureaucratic style, pay more attention to the lives of the masses, and seriously implement the state's plans and various regulations, we will definitely be able to do a better job in improving the material lives of workers.

Second, regarding the improvement of farmers' material lives:

To improve the material lives of farmers, on the one hand, we should pay attention to adjusting the ratio of national accumulation and cooperative income and correctly solving the problem of farmers' burdens; on the other hand, we should also pay attention to adjusting the ratio of public accumulation and individual income within agricultural production cooperatives and correctly solving the problem of cooperative income distribution. During the second five-year plan period, agricultural taxes should be maintained at an appropriate ratio, and the regular and additional agricultural taxes will be unified for collection to simplify the tax system; at the same time, we require all cooperatives to implement the regulations of the "Model Constitution for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives" to generally not exceed the proportion quotas stipulated in the constitution for public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and management expenses. In this way, if the agricultural increase plan can be completed during the second five-year plan period, it will be possible to increase farmers' total income by 25% to 30% in five years.

During the second five-year plan period, the state will continue to help agricultural production cooperatives develop production from various aspects, and the investment in water conservancy construction and agriculture will be significantly increased compared to the first five-year plan, and agricultural loans will also be increased; at the same time, the state will still allocate a portion of special funds for disaster relief in rural areas. For many mountainous areas and old revolutionary base areas with poor natural conditions, the state should pay special attention to helping local people develop production and improve their lives in the future.

Third, regarding the improvement of the cultural lives of the people:

During the second five-year plan period, with the development of economic construction and the increase of people's demand for culture, we should, according to the proposal, continue to strive to eliminate illiteracy, develop primary education, carry out adult education for workers and peasants, and gradually promote the reform of the script. At the same time, we should further carry out cultural work for the masses, develop news, publishing, broadcasting, literature, art, film, etc. When carrying out these undertakings, we should especially pay attention to improving quality.

In carrying out cultural and educational work among the broad masses of people, we must adopt active yet steady steps. In recent years, we have had either conservative or rash tendencies in the work of eliminating illiteracy, primary education, social culture, and publishing, causing unnecessary losses to the work. In the future, we must learn from this lesson and carry out cultural and educational work based on needs and possibilities.

In carrying out cultural and educational work for the masses, we must fully rely on the strength of the masses and adopt the mass line work method. In the past, cultural and educational work often had the tendency of doing everything for the masses, and we must correct this. We must adhere to the principle of voluntarism in work and consult with the masses on everything. For those undertakings that are truly needed by the masses, have the conditions, and are voluntarily carried out by the masses, such as people's schools, literacy classes, clubs, amateur drama troupes, etc., we should support and help them and strengthen leadership. Of course, when using the strength of the masses, we must always pay attention to cherishing manpower and time and not arbitrarily increase the burden on the people.

Fourth, regarding the improvement of people's health:

During the second five-year plan period, we must continue to develop the health and medical industry, further carry out sports, and appropriately promote family planning.

In recent years, the Patriotic Health Campaign has played a significant role in improving environmental hygiene and reducing diseases. However, in recent years, we have relaxed the leadership of the Patriotic Health Campaign, and in the future, we should continue to vigorously carry out this campaign and make it more in-depth and regular to further improve the environmental hygiene of cities and villages and reduce the incidence of various infectious diseases and occupational diseases. At the same time, we should actively promote the experience of treating schistosomiasis and carry out the planned and phased elimination of serious local diseases. The primary medical organizations in cities and villages across the country have played a significant role in preventing and treating diseases, and in the future, the health department should strengthen their leadership.

In the health and medical industry, there are still many shortcomings, such as: due to poor management in hospitals, high fees, making the limited number of beds not fully utilized, and making some people unable to see a doctor or stay in a hospital; sanatorium beds lack unified management, causing great waste; in addition, there are also inappropriate places in the public medical care system and medical work system. To eliminate these unreasonable phenomena, the health department should seriously investigate and study and propose feasible improvement measures.

We should further carry out sports among the broad masses to effectively enhance the physical fitness of the people and improve the level of sports in China. When carrying out sports, we must proceed based on the specific situation of people's production, work, study, and physical conditions, and in a differentiated and phased manner, avoiding the tendency of setting too high and urgent requirements and generalizing.

To protect women and children, to raise the next generation well, and to benefit the health and prosperity of the nation, we support appropriate control in the aspect of childbirth. The health department should cooperate with relevant parties to appropriately publicize the issue of family planning and take effective measures.

Eleventh, regarding the continued promotion of thrift:

Thrift is a fine tradition of the Chinese people. All state organs, state-owned enterprises, institutions, and cooperatives should promote thrift to make full use of manpower, material resources, and financial resources to accelerate the construction of Chinese socialism.

A year ago, the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council called on all state organ workers and the people of the whole country to promote thrift, oppose waste, and overcome the phenomena of excessive non-productive construction, high costs of productive construction, poor quality of projects and products, large material losses, and bloated organizations and idle personnel. After more than a year of efforts, significant achievements have been made. However, it should be pointed out that the policy of thrift has not been well implemented in all departments, and the phenomenon of waste still exists; at the same time, in the process of promoting thrift and opposing rightist conservative thoughts, due to one-sided thrift views or the tendency of pursuing quantity and speed while neglecting quality and economy, the quality of projects and products has also encountered many problems, some of which require rework and repair, some of which will reduce effectiveness, and even become waste, thus not only failing to achieve the goal of thrift but also causing waste.

During the second five-year plan period, due to the expansion of the scale of national construction, we will encounter many difficulties in material supply, funding sources, and technical forces, and promoting thrift and rationally using manpower, material resources, and financial resources is an important way to overcome these difficulties. It should be admitted that the good or bad of a plan has a significant impact on thrift or waste. The thrift caused by a plan is the greatest thrift, and the waste caused by a plan is the greatest waste. Therefore, all levels of state organs and enterprise departments should first do a good job in planning. All enterprise units should strengthen quota management, promote various reasonable advanced quotas; strengthen technical management, improve the quality of products and projects, reduce defective products, substandard products, and project quality accidents; implement the responsibility system, overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible, to prevent waste and tap the potential of thrift. All institutional units should reduce unnecessary institutional expenditures and personnel quotas, strengthen financial management and auditing work, to reduce the proportion of institutional funds in the budget. All cooperatives should continue to implement the policy of thrift in management.

In state administrative organs, we should continue to overcome the phenomena of overlapping organizations and idle personnel. Currently, in various levels of state administrative organs, generally speaking, the organizations are still too large, and the personnel are still too many, and this phenomenon is more serious in higher-level organs and larger organs than in lower-level organs and smaller organs. We must take effective measures to continue to adjust the organizations and personnel of various levels, streamline administrative organs, appropriately transfer organ personnel to production units, and transfer non-production personnel to production units. This is an effective way to implement the policy of thrift in state organs at present.

Twelfth, regarding the strengthening of unity and cooperation with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and the expansion of international economic, technological, and cultural cooperation and exchanges:

To complete our socialist construction, in addition to mobilizing all positive factors at home, we must also unite all possible forces internationally and strive for all favorable conditions internationally. We have always striven to strengthen unity with the great Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries and carry out all-round cooperation and mutual assistance with them. We have also striven to develop economic cooperation, trade exchanges, and cultural and technological exchanges with countries of different social systems, especially with Asian and African countries.

The mutual assistance and cooperation relationship between China and the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries is based on an unbreakable brotherly friendship and aims to promote the common prosperity of the socialist countries' economies and continuously improve the material welfare and cultural level of the people of socialist countries.

As mentioned earlier, whether in the period of restoring the national economy or in the period of implementing the first five-year plan for developing the national economy, China has received tremendous and sincere assistance from the Soviet Union in all aspects, and has also received significant assistance from various brotherly countries. This assistance has helped us overcome many difficulties and enabled China's socialist construction to develop at a relatively high speed. During the second five-year plan period, the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries will continue to provide us with large-scale brotherly assistance, especially those large enterprises designed and equipped by the Soviet Union and many people's democratic countries will further lay the foundation for China's socialist industrialization. In the past, we have benefited a lot from learning the advanced construction experience and scientific and technological achievements of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and in the future, we must continue to learn from them humbly.

As a member of the socialist camp, China has its own responsibility, and we must do a good job in this regard. We have the obligation to supply various brotherly countries with many agricultural products, animal products, mineral raw materials, and some machinery and equipment, and industrial products needed in their construction. We must strive to increase production or appropriately save domestic consumption to ensure the supply of these products. To carry out equal and mutually beneficial, complementary trade with other countries, we also need to properly plan our domestic production and consumption to ensure necessary exports.

In recent years, China's economic, technological, and cultural cooperation and exchanges with many Asian and African countries have become increasingly close. Especially since the Bandung Conference, this cooperation and exchange has developed more broadly. Most Asian and African countries urgently need to eliminate the economic and cultural backwardness caused by long-term colonial rule, and deeply feel the necessity of economic and cultural cooperation with each other. China has always advocated carrying out such cooperation with Asian and African countries on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and no conditions attached, promoting their independent development in the economy and technology, and developing their own strengths and learning from each other in culture. This cooperation helps to safeguard the national independence of Asian and African countries and expand the peaceful regions, and is therefore beneficial to China's peaceful construction. Although the scope of this cooperation is not very large at present, it is important that Asian and African countries have begun to cooperate and are expanding their ties with Latin American countries, and such cooperation and exchanges undoubtedly have a broad prospect for development.

We are also willing to develop economic, technological, and cultural ties with other countries in the world based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. We have always been working to expand trade with Western countries and are willing to absorb useful things from their scientific and technological and management methods for our construction. Although the United States has imposed an embargo on us and forced many countries to adopt the same policy, this policy that completely violates the interests of the peoples of all countries has already encountered increasingly strong opposition from all sides. This unreasonable man-made obstacle will eventually be eliminated.

We advocate the expansion of international economic, technological, and cultural cooperation and exchanges, not only to accelerate the completion of our socialist construction but also because this will lay a reliable foundation for peaceful coexistence among countries. Therefore, this is completely in line with the interests of the people of the world and completely in line with the interests of the peace cause.

Comrades, the day of the successful completion of the first five-year plan and the start of the second five-year plan is not far away. In the next year or so, all comrades of the Party should, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, redouble their efforts, together with the workers, peasants, and intellectuals of the whole country, and together with all ethnic groups, parties, and patriotic individuals of the whole country, strive to overfulfill the first five-year plan and actively prepare for the second five-year plan. As long as we are modest and prudent, not arrogant or impatient, and correct the subjective and bureaucratic tendencies in our work, we will be able to mobilize all forces, overcome all difficulties, and advance victoriously in the struggle to build China into a great socialist industrial power!

    关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告
    （一九五六年九月十六日）
    周恩来同志们：
    我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，再经过一年多的时间，就要胜利地完成了。为了使我们能够在第一个五年计划完成以后，立即顺利地开始进行第二个五年计划的建设，党中央委员会认为，有必要及早着手进行第二个五年计划的编制工作。现在，党中央委员会把关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议，提请党的第八次全国代表大会审查。这个建议经过这次党代表大会讨论并且通过以后，将提交国务院讨论。
    关于我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的基本方针和政策，在刘少奇同志代表党中央委员会所作的政治报告中，已经有了说明。现在，我受党中央委员会的委托，向大会作关于第二个五年计划的建议的报告。
    一、第一个五年计划执行的情况
    我在说明第二个五年计划的建议以前，要说一说关于执行第一个五年计划的基本情况。
    在执行第一个五年计划的过程中，由于全国人民首先是劳动人民的努力，我们的社会主义建设工作和社会主义改造工作都取得了比预想还要快还要大的胜利。我们的成就是巨大的，但是在工作中也发生了一些缺点和错误，需要我们努力加以克服。
    在基本建设方面。预计到一九五七年底，全国基本建设的投资额，有可能比原计划超额完成百分之十以上。计划所规定的限额以上的建设单位，除了少数的以外，都有可能如期完成或者提前完成建设进度，而且在各个年度中又增加了一些新开工的建设单位。到一九五七年底，预计大约有五百个新建和改建的限额以上的工业企业建设完工，这样，就会提高我国的工业生产能力，为我国的工业创立某些新的部门和在一定程度上革新某些原有的部门，从而开始改变我国工业原来极端落后的面貌。经过第一个五年计划的建设，我国以鞍山钢铁联合企业为中心的东北工业基地就会大为加强，在内蒙古、西北、华北各地，就会开始出现许多新的工业城市。五年内新建和恢复的铁路将达到五千五百公里左右，重要的干线如集宁到二连、宝鸡到成都等线都已经修通，鹰潭到厦门的铁路也将要修通，兰州到新疆的铁路已经修到玉门以西。重要的公路如康藏线和青藏线等也都已经全部通车。这些铁路和公路的建成，加强了我国西北、西南广大地区同全国各地区的联系。关于水利建设，我们正在继续根治淮河，开始兴建黄河三门峡水利、水力枢纽工程，并且举办了其他一些大型和很多中、小型的水利工程。许多建设完工的水利工程，对于防御洪水和灌溉田地已经开始发挥一定的作用。这几年来，地质工作也做出了很大的成绩，保证了我国基本建设的需要。如上所说，我国第一个五年计划的基本建设，从投资额和多数重要建设单位的进度说，将有可能达到我们预定的要求。但是也应该指出，某些部门，有可能完不成原定的投资额计划，少数重要建设单位的部分工程，也有可能完不成原定的进度计划。这些部门和这些建设单位，在今后一年多的时间内，应该加强工作，尽可能地争取完成原定的计划。同时还应该指出，有一些建设单位只注意赶进度，忽视质量和安全，以致工程质量低劣，事故很多，并且造成浪费，这是应该引以为戒的。
    在工业生产方面。工业总产值（包括现代工业和手工业的产值在内，按一九五二年的不变价格计算，下同）历年都超额完成了年度计划，一九五六年，将达到五年计划规定的一九五七年的水平；到一九五七年，将有可能比原计划超额完成百分之十五左右。从主要工业产品的产量说，到一九五七年，绝大多数产品都将超过原定的计划指标。例如钢将达到五百五十万吨，发电量将达到一百八十亿度，煤将达到一亿二千万吨，金属切削机床将达到三万台，发电设备将达到三十四万瓩，原木将达到二千四百万立方公尺，棉纱将达到五百六十万件，机制糖将达到八十万吨，机制纸将达到八十万吨。从重要的工业新产品说，我国过去不能够制造的某些发电设备、冶金设备、采矿设备和新型号金属切削机床，现在已经能够制造了；我国过去不能够制造的汽车和喷气式飞机，现在已经能够开始制造了；我国过去不能够生产的大型钢材和合金优质钢，现在也已经开始部分生产了。但是，也有几种产品，如石油、硫化青、食用植物油、卷烟、火柴等，由于原料不足、销路不畅或者技术的原因，可能完不成原定的产量计划。
    在农业生产方面。一九五三年和一九五四年，我国许多地区受到了较大的自然灾害，这两年的农业生产计划都没有全部完成，但是粮食产量仍比丰收的一九五二年有所增加。一九五五年我国农产品丰收，粮食产量（不包括大豆，下同）达到三千四百九十六亿斤，棉花产量达到三千零三十六万担，其他农产品的产量也都有增加。一九五六年许多地区遭受了洪水、内涝、台风和干旱的严重灾害，某些农作物特别是棉花受了一定的损失。但是由于全国农村正处在合作化的高潮中，没有遭受灾害的地区将会增加生产，一九五六年全国的粮食总产量，仍然有可能达到第一个五年计划规定的一九五七年的水平。只要今后一年多的时间内不发生特大的自然灾害，一九五七年主要的粮食作物和某些经济作物的产量，就有可能超额完成原定的计划。但是大豆、花生、油菜籽、黄麻、洋麻的产量和某些牲畜的数量，有可能完不成原定的计划，我们必须采取有效的措施来加强这些薄弱的环节。
    在运输和邮电方面。随着工农业生产的发展和基本建设规模的扩大，运输量和邮电业务量每年都有增长。预计到一九五七年，主要运输部门的货物运输周转量计划，都有可能超额完成。但是由于某些原有线路和设备的技术改造没有完成计划，某些线路和交通枢纽目前发生了运输紧张甚至堵塞的现象，这种情况正在努力加以改善。
    在商业方面。随着社会主义商业的日益发展，一个有计划有组织的市场已经在国内形成，它的领导地位已经日益巩固。一九五六年比一九五二年，国内社会商品总额将增长百分之六十六·三，对外贸易的进出口总值将增长百分之六十五。预计到一九五七年，国内的社会商品零售总额和多数商品销售量的计划，对外贸易的出口和进口的计划，都有可能完成，有的可以超额完成。几年来，在生产发展的基础上扩大了国内商品的流转额，并且对于最主要的几种生活必需品，实行了统购统销的政策，保证了人民生活必需品的供应，因而基本上保持了物价的稳定，促进了工农业生产的发展和人民生活的改善。目前商业工作中的缺点，主要是商品供应的组织工作做得不好和经营管理不善，因而发生商品有时积压有时脱销的现象。
    在文化教育、科学研究和保健事业方面。这几年来，这些事业都有相当大的发展。预计到一九五七年，除了个别的以外，高等教育、中等教育、初等教育、科学研究、新闻、出版、广播、文学、艺术、电影、体育和卫生医疗等事业，都有可能超额完成原定的计划。例如，到一九五七年，高等学校在校学生将达到四十七万人左右，超过原定指标约百分之九；中国科学院的研究机构将达到六十八所，比原定指标多十七所。
    在农业和手工业的合作化方面。到一九五六年六月底为止，全国已经组织起九十九万二千个农业生产合作社，入社农户占全国农户总数的百分之九十一·七，其中加入高级社的占全国农户总数的百分之六十二·六。组织起来的手工业者，约占手工业者总数的百分之九十。我们预计，再经过一年多的工作，即到一九五七年底，在全国范围内，除了个别边疆地区以外，可以基本上实现农业和手工业的合作化。
    在私营工商业的社会主义改造方面。到一九五六年六月底为止，在资本主义工业中，已经有占产值百分之九十九和占职工人数百分之九十八的企业实现了公私合营；在私营商业和饮食业中，转变为公私合营商店、合作商店和合作小组的，已经占总户数的百分之六十八，占从业人员总数的百分之七十四。对资本主义工商业实行全行业公私合营和定息制度，就为资本主义生产资料的国有化准备了条件。
    这里，我还要简略地叙述一下人民物质生活改善的状况。
    这几年里面，从总的情况看，职工工资的增长速度同劳动生产率的增长速度，基本上是相适应的。但是有一段时间，工资的增长速度过分地低于劳动生产率的增长速度。例如，一九五五年比一九五四年，工业部门（不包括私营工业）的劳动生产率，约提高了百分之十，而职工的平均工资只提高了百分之○·六。其他部门也有类似的情况。这个工作中的错误，我们在一九五五年底发现以后，就着手纠正。从一九五六年四月份起，我们在全国范围内实行了工资制度的改革，并且确定一九五六年职工的平均工资比一九五五年提高百分之十三左右。这样，一九五六年职工的平均工资，就比一九五二年提高了百分之三十三·五，超过了五年计划规定的五年内工资增长百分之三十三的指标。而劳动生产率的增长也将超过原定的计划，例如，在国营工业部门，一九五六年将比一九五二年提高百分之七十·四，超过五年计划规定的五年内劳动生产率增长百分之六十四的指标。
    这几年里面，我们稳定了农民的农业税负担，并且适当地提高了粮食的收购价格，因而使农民在生产发展的基础上逐步地改善了生活。但是我们也犯过错误，在一九五四年，由于我们没有完全弄清楚全国粮食产量的情况，向农民多购了一些粮食，引起了一部分农民的不满。在一九五五年，我们实行了定产、定购、定销的粮食政策，从而安定了农民的情绪和提高了他们的生产积极性。现在预计，五年内农民的全部收入有可能增长百分之三十左右。
    由上面列举的情况可以看出，我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，是一定能够胜利完成的。只要我们加紧努力，并且今后不再发生特大的自然灾害和意外事故，大多数指标都可以超额完成。第一个五年计划的执行和它的超额完成，已经使并且将要使我国国民经济发生深刻的变化。这主要表现在：工农业的生产水平有很大的提高。预计到一九五七年，工农业总产值（包括现代工业、手工业和农业的产值在内）将比一九五二年增加百分之六十以上。在工农业总产值中，工业总产值（包括手工业的产值在内）的比重将达到百分之五十左右，而在工业总产值中，生产资料工业产值的比重将达到百分之四十以上，这就加强了工业在国民经济中的领导作用。由于社会主义改造事业取得了决定性的胜利，无论在工业、农业、运输业和商业中，社会主义的经济成分都已经处于绝对统治的地位。有了上述这些变化，国民经济的各个部门都出现了欣欣向荣的景象，文化教育和科学研究的事业，也正在进入一个繁荣时期，因而也就为人民生活水平的继续提高创造了条件。
    应该指出，全国各族人民、各民主党派和一切爱国人士，在中国共产党的领导下的团结一致，对社会主义改造事业和社会主义建设事业所表现的积极性和热情，是我们取得上述伟大成就的基础和保证。
    还应该指出，在我国实行第一个五年计划的过程中，伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家给了我们巨大的援助。在这期间，苏联给予我国以优惠的贷款，帮助我国设计二百零五项工业企业和供应大部分设备，派来了大批的优秀专家，并且给了其他方面的许多技术援助。各人民民主国家在设备、材料和技术力量等方面也给了我们很大的援助。在我国工作的苏联和各人民民主国家的专家，对于我国社会主义建设事业，作出了卓越的贡献。我们愿意乘这个机会，对于苏联和各人民民主国家的这种真诚的兄弟般的援助，表示深切的感谢。
    我们在执行第一个五年计划的过程中，取得了不少的经验和教训。吸取这些经验和教训，就使我们有可能把社会主义建设的工作做得更好。现在，我只就近年来我们在领导经济工作中所感到的几个比较突出的问题，提出一些意见。
    第一，应该根据需要和可能，合理地规定国民经济的发展速度，把计划放在既积极又稳妥可靠的基础上，以保证国民经济比较均衡地发展。由于在编制长期计划的时候，难以完全预计到在执行计划过程中可能发生的各种新的情况和问题，因此，应该把长期计划的指标定得比较可靠，而由年度计划加以调整。我国第一个五年计划所规定的各项指标，基本上是正确的，过去四个年度计划的安排，大体上也是符合于当时的具体情况的，因而有可能保证我国第一个五年计划的超额完成。但是应该指出，一九五五年和一九五六年的计划，部分地发生了偏低或者偏高的缺点，造成了工作上的一些困难。
    我们在制定一九五五年计划的时候，由于前两年农业歉收，把基本建设的规模定得比较小了一些，而且在当年的节约运动中，又不适当地削减了某些非生产性的基本建设的投资。同时，还由于基本建设计划变动的次数多，下达迟，因而计划完成得比较差。结果，不但在财政上出现了过多的结余，并且在重要的建筑材料方面，如钢材、水泥、木材等，也出现了一时的虚假的过剩现象。如果我们能够更早地准备一些预备项目，及时地扩大建设规模，或者有计划地增加某些物资的储备，物资一时积压的问题是可以解决的。可是我们对以后发展的情况估计不足，把一时的物资过剩当作一个比较长期的趋势，因而用出口的办法来解决钢材和水泥一时多余的困难。显然，这是不恰当的。
    当我们制定一九五六年计划的时候，由于上年度农业丰收，社会主义改造又取得了巨大的胜利，因而有必要也有可能把国民经济发展的速度定得比较高些。但是我们没有很好地对于基本建设规模和物资供应能力进行适当的平衡，因而把基本建设的规模定得大了一些。同时，国民经济的某些部门也出现了齐头并进和急于求成的倾向。结果，不但财政上比较紧张，而且引起了钢材、水泥、木材等各种建筑材料严重不足的现象，从而过多地动用了国家的物资储备，并且造成国民经济各方面的相当紧张的局面。
    经验证明，我们在编制长期计划的时候，应该按照我们实现社会主义工业化的根本要求和国家物力、财力、人力的可能条件，实事求是地规定各项指标，同时，还应该保留一定的后备力量，使计划比较可靠。而在编制年度计划的时候，就应该根据当年和以后年度的可能的发展条件，积极地发挥潜在力量，以保证长期计划的完成和超额完成。经验还证明，我们在编制年度计划的时候，在有利的情况下，必须注意到当前和以后还存在着某些不利的因素，不要急躁冒进；相反地，在不利的情况下，又必须注意到当前和以后还存在着许多有利的因素，不要裹足不前。这就是说，我们应该对客观情况作全面的分析，同时尽可能地把本年度和下年度的主要指标作统一的安排，以便使每个年度都能够互相衔接和比较均衡地向前发展。
    第二，应该使重点建设和全面安排相结合，以便国民经济各部门能够按比例地发展。在过去几年里，我们在优先发展重工业的同时，采取了加速发展农业合作化的方针来促进农业的增产，并且相应地发展了轻工业的生产，这就使国民经济的几个主要部门在发展中避免了互相脱节的危险。
    但是我们在处理重点建设和全面安排这个关系的时候，也曾经部分地犯过错误。例如，在一九五三年，有些部门和有些地方，在建设工作中曾经发生过到处铺开、百废俱兴、不顾条件、盲目冒进的偏向，结果，影响到国家的重点建设，并且造成了财政上的困难和人力、物力的浪费。在一九五六年初，当“一九五六年到一九六七年全国农业发展纲要”（草案）公布以后，又一次发生了这样的偏向。有些部门和有些地方，急于求成，企图把在七年或者十二年内才能够做完的事情，在三年、五年甚至一年、二年内办完。这些偏向，都被党中央及时地发现和纠正了。
    在这个时期中间，也曾经出现了另一种偏向，就是某些重要工作过分突出，以致同有关方面脱节。例如，在一九五六年初，我们为着加速发展农业，曾经过高地估计了双轮双铧犁和锅驼机的当年需要量，制定了过高的生产计划，虽然这两种产品的计划经过一再修改，压缩产量，但是计划仍然过高，结果不但消耗了过多的钢材，造成一九五六年钢材供应更加紧张的情况，而且使某些机械工厂发生了一时赶工增产、一时闲工减产的现象。又例如，在我们的建设中，某种工业企业由于前进过快，所需要的原材料无法全部供应，因而发生了生产能力不能充分发挥的困难。当然，在我们开始进行工业建设的时期，这种情况是难以完全避免的，但是预料到这样的困难而更加妥善地进行安排，也并不是不可能的。
    这几年来，我们在建设事业中，对中央和地方的关系、近海地区和内地的关系，也作了大体适当的安排，但是我们在这方面还是有缺点的。有一段时间，我们重视了中央建设事业的发展，而对地方建设事业的发展注意得不够；我们重视了内地建设事业的发展，而对近海地区建设事业的发展注意得不够。今后，我们应该经常地注意调整上述的关系，避免发生片面性。
    以上说明，我们强调重点建设，并不是说可以孤立地发展重点，而不要全面安排；我们要求全面安排，也不是说可以齐头并进，而不要保证重点建设。我们在制订计划和安排工作的时候，必须把重点和全面很好地结合起来。
    第三，应该增加后备力量，健全物资储备制度。在国民经济的发展中，不平衡的现象是经常会出现的，这就必须保持必要的物资、财政、矿产资源、生产能力等的后备力量，特别要增加国家的物资储备，以保证国民经济的均衡发展和年度计划的顺利执行，并且应付可能遇到的意外的困难。今后若干年内，我国农业生产受自然灾害的影响还会是很大的，为了应付歉收，就必须有粮食和主要经济作物的储备；为了满足我国建设和生产规模日益扩大的需要，就必须有器材和原料的储备。此外，我们计划工作还缺乏经验，计划常常有不全和不准的缺点，即使计划当时订得比较准确，也可能由于难以预料的因素又产生新的不平衡。例如，一九五六年由于采用新技术，提高了平炉和高炉的利用效率，矿石和焦炭便供应不足。为了消除或者减少在执行计划中可能发生的各种不平衡现象，也必须保留必要的后备力量。
    这几年来，国家储备的物资虽然还不很多，可是对于保证生产和基本建设的需要曾经起了一定的作用，对于一九五六年的物资供应的紧张状况也曾经起了一定的缓和作用。但是应该指出，我们过去对于物资储备的重要性还认识不够。正像我们在前面说过的那样，当一九五五年某些物资略有多余的时候，就不适当地出口了一部分；到了一九五六年，由于基本建设规模的扩大，又感到这些物资的严重不足。
    必须认识，像我们这样一个经济落后人口众多的国家，在相当长的时期内，各种物资的缺乏是经常的现象，而物资的多余是暂时的现象。这就需要我们更加注意增加后备力量，建立物资储备制度，由国家储备必要的物资，特别是比较缺乏的重要物资。同时，各个国营企业也应该有适当的储备。当然，不论是国家的或者是国营企业的物资储备，都应该加强计划性，规定合理的定额，逐步增加，不能要求一下子增加很多，以免妨碍当前的生产和建设。并且，我们也要反对把由于盲目生产所造成的产品积压，当做国家的物资储备，因为这种做法，必然会造成国家资金的积压和浪费，也是对生产和建设不利的。
    第四，应该正确地处理经济和财政的关系。多年来的经验是：我们的财政收入必须建立在经济发展的基础上，我们的财政支出也必须首先保证经济的发展。因此，应该首先考虑经济、特别是工农业生产的发展计划，然后根据它来制订财政计划，用财政计划保证经济计划的圆满执行。不根据经济发展的情况开辟财政来源，把财政收入计算得过少，或者单从节约财政开支着想，保留过多的后备力量，都将限制经济建设的充分发展，这是不对的。
    我们在制定财政收入计划的时候，必须考虑到经济发展的可能性，考虑到积累和消费之间正确的比例关系，避免把收入定得过分紧张。在制定财政支出计划的时候，除了必须根据保证重点建设和国民经济按比例发展的要求、进行正确的分配以外，还必须考虑到建设规模和物资供应之间的平衡，考虑到意外的需要而留出一定数量的预备费，避免把支出定得过分紧张。如果只顾建设的要求，不顾财政的可能，不顾设备、器材和技术力量是否能够供应，而提出过高过大的拨款和投资的计划，显然也是不对的。
    同志们常常喜欢争论应该不应该有“财政框框”的问题。我们的意见是，不考虑经济发展的需要，主观地定出一个“财政框框”来限制经济的发展，这当然是错误的，应该反对这样的“财政框框”。但是，如果财政计划符合于经济发展的实际情况，体现着积累和消费之间的正确关系，重点建设和全面安排之间的正确关系，那末这样的财政计划，无疑地应该严格执行，决不能够当作“财政框框”盲目反对。
    在这里还要指出，我们在工作中所发生的一些缺点和错误，有许多是同领导上的主观主义和官僚主义分不开的。有些领导同志高高在上，不接近群众，不了解实际情况，主观地处理问题和布置工作，因而所作的决定就很难正确，甚至发生错误。而上级的官僚主义，又助长了下级的命令主义。
    现在国务院各部门机构大，层次多，因而公文多，电报多，表格多，弄得下级机关疲于奔命。而有的部门的领导同志，甚至还不知道自己的部门发了些什么指示，作了些什么规定。这样的官僚主义的现象，必须迅速加以纠正。
    在我们政府的工作中，虽然取得了巨大的成绩，但是决不容许我们有丝毫的骄傲自满。应该看到，我国的国民经济正在迅速发展，情况的变化很快也很多，随时随地都有新的问题出现，许多问题又是错综复杂地联系着。因此，我们就必须经常地接近群众，深入实际，加强调查研究工作，掌握情况的变化，对有利的条件和不利的条件进行具体的分析，对顺利的方面和困难的方面都要有足够的估计，以便及时地做出决定，调节国民经济各部门和各方面的活动，避免发生互相脱节或者互相冲突的现象。在我们这样一个地区广阔、情况复杂并且经济上正在剧烈变革的国家里，任何疏忽大意，都可能发生重大的错误，造成重大的损失。因此，克服主观主义和官僚主义，对我们有着特殊重要的意义。
    二、第二个五年计划的基本任务
    党中央委员会认为，编制我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划，应该以第一个五年计划可能达到的成就作为出发点，联系到大约在第三个五年计划期末我国要完成过渡时期的总任务这个基本要求，实事求是地估计到第二个五年计划期间国内外的各种条件，进行全面的规划。这样，才有可能使计划既积极而又稳妥可靠。
    党中央委员会提出，我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的基本任务应该是：（1）继续进行以重工业为中心的工业建设，推进国民经济的技术改造，建立我国社会主义工业化的巩固基础；（2）继续完成社会主义改造，巩固和扩大集体所有制和全民所有制；（3）在发展基本建设和继续完成社会主义改造的基础上，进一步地发展工业、农业和手工业的生产，相应地发展运输业和商业；（4）努力培养建设人材，加强科学研究工作，以适应社会主义经济文化发展的需要；（5）在工业农业生产发展的基础上，增强国防力量，提高人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平。
    我国社会主义工业化的主要要求，就是要在大约三个五年计划时期内，基本上建成一个完整的工业体系。这样的工业体系，能够生产各种主要的机器设备和原材料，基本上满足我国扩大再生产和国民经济技术改造的需要。同时，它也能够生产各种消费品，适当地满足人民生活水平不断提高的需要。
    有人问：既然以苏联为首的社会主义各国的经济日益发展，并且在社会主义各国之间出现了经济和技术的广泛合作的可能性，我国是否还有必要建立完整的工业体系呢？我们认为，我国目前的情况虽然同苏联建国初期在经济上处于孤立无援的情况有很大的不同，苏联和各人民民主国家的存在和发展，是我国社会主义建设的极有利的条件，但是像我们这样一个人口众多、资源较富、需要很大的国家，仍然有必要建立自己的完整的工业体系。这是因为，从国内的要求来说，我们必须迅速改变国民经济长期的落后状态；从国际的要求来说，我国建立起强大的工业，可以促进社会主义各国经济的共同高涨，并且可以增强保卫世界和平的力量。因此，那种以为不必建立我国自己的完整的工业体系而专门靠国际援助的依赖思想，是错误的。
    另一种关起门来建设的想法也是错误的。不用说，我国要建立起一个完整的工业体系，在长时期内还需要苏联和各人民民主国家的援助，同时也需要同其他国家发展和扩大经济、技术、文化的交流。而且即使我们在将来建成了社会主义工业国之后，也不可能设想，我们就可以关起门来万事不求人了。事实表明，不仅社会主义各国之间的经济和技术的协作范围将不断地扩大，而且由于各国人民争取和平、民主、民族独立的力量日益强大，国际局势日益趋于和缓，我国同世界各国在经济上、技术上、文化上的联系，必然会一天比一天发展。因此，在建设社会主义事业中的孤立思想，也是错误的。
    为了建立我国社会主义工业化的巩固基础，在第二个五年计划期间，必须继续扩大冶金工业的建设，大力推进机器制造工业的建设，加强电力工业、煤炭工业和建筑材料工业的建设，积极进行工业中的落后部门——石油工业、化学工业和无线电工业的建设。同时，还必须推进国民经济的技术改造，首先是进行工业的技术改造，以提高我国工业的技术水平。
    经验证明，以重工业为中心的工业建设，是不能够也不应该孤立地进行的，它必须有各个方面的配合，特别是农业的配合。农业是工业发展以至整个国民经济发展必不可少的条件。延缓农业的发展，不仅直接地影响轻工业的发展和人民生活的改善，而且也将极大地影响重工业以至整个国民经济的发展，影响工农联盟的巩固。因此，在第二个五年计划期间，我们应该继续努力发展农业，求得农业和工业的发展互相配合。为了使国民经济的各个部门和各个方面按比例地、互相协调地发展，我们又应该妥善地安排重工业和轻工业之间的关系，工农业生产和运输、商品流转之间的关系，经济建设和文化建设之间的关系，国家建设和人民生活之间的关系；同时，还应该进一步地安排中央和地方之间的关系，近海地区和内地之间的关系，各个民族之间的关系，以便把一切积极的因素和有用的力量都组织到建设社会主义的伟大事业中来。
    在第二个五年计划期间，我国的基本建设和工农业生产将有可能继续保持比较快的发展速度。党中央委员会认为，在第二个五年计划期间，在财政收入增加的基础上，国家的基本建设投资在全部财政收入中所占的比重，将由第一个五年的百分之三十五左右增加到百分之四十左右，因而第二个五年的基本建设投资额，就将比第一个五年增长一倍左右。在工农业生产方面，初步计算，一九六二年比一九五七年，工业总产值将增长一倍左右，其中，生产资料和消费资料的产值都会有很大的增长，但是生产资料产值增长的速度将会更快一些；农业总产值将增长百分之三十五左右。到一九六二年，我国工农业总产值将比第一个五年计划规定的一九五七年的数字增长百分之七十五左右。
    这里应该加以说明，第二个五年计划的建议中所列举的增长百分数，都是以第一个五年的计划数字作为基数进行比较的，并没有把可能超额完成的因素计算进去，因而增长的百分数就显得高些；等到第一个五年计划结束以后，如果以一九五七年实际达到的数字作为基数，那末现在建议中的增长百分数将有可能相对地下降一些。例如：在建议中提出的我国的钢产量，一九六二年计划达到一千零五十万吨到一千二百万吨，这个数字同第一个五年计划规定的一九五七年的产量四百一十二万吨作比较，将增长一·五倍到一·九倍，但是，如果同现在预计的一九五七年产量五百五十万吨作比较，那末就增长将近一倍到一·二倍。
    上述关于基本建设的规模和工农业生产的发展速度，我们认为是适当的，是积极而又稳妥可靠的。应该相信，只要我们善于依靠群众，发挥群众的积极性和创造性，我们就能够取得伟大的力量，克服在前进道路上的一切困难，像执行第一个五年计划那样，胜利地完成第二个五年计划的任务。
    三、关于第二个五年计划
    建议的若干主要问题
    上面我说明了第二个五年计划的基本任务。关于第二个五年计划的具体方针和指标，在党中央委员会提出的建议中，都已经提到了。这里，我只扼要地说明关于第二个五年计划建议的若干主要问题。
    （一）合理地积累和分配资金
    国家建设规模的大小，主要决定于我们可能积累多少资金和如何分配资金。我们的资金积累较多，分配得当，社会扩大再生产的速度就会较快，国民经济各部门就能够按比例地发展。因此，合理地解决资金积累和资金分配的问题是很重要的。
    国民收入是全国劳动人民在生产过程中新创造的物质财富。在社会主义国家里面，全部国民收入都归劳动人民自己所有。劳动人民把国民收入的一部分用来维持和改善自己的生活，另一部分用于社会扩大再生产，也就是说用作积累。在分配和再分配国民收入的时候，必须使消费部分和积累部分保持适当的比例。消费部分所占比例小了，就会妨碍人民生活的改善；积累部分所占比例小了，就会降低社会扩大再生产的速度。这两种情况都是对人民不利的。
    在第二个五年计划期间，国民收入将有可能比第一个五年增长百分之五十左右。由于我国国民经济还很落后，农业所占的比重还比较大，人民生活的水平还比较低，因此，积累部分在国民收入中所占的比重，不可能也不应该有过多的和过快的增长，但是可以稍高于第一个五年已经达到的水平。这样，在第二个五年计划期内，积累的总额，将随着国民收入的增长，仍然会有比较多的增加。
    在解决了资金积累的问题以后，还必须解决资金分配的问题。考虑到目前的国内条件和国际条件，党中央委员会认为，在第二个五年计划期间，我们已经有必要和可能适当地降低国家预算中的国防和行政费用的比重，而提高经济和文化教育支出的比重。第一个五年国防和行政的费用，约占财政支出的百分之三十二左右，第二个五年应该争取降低到百分之二十左右。这样，经济和文化教育支出所占的比重，就有可能由第一个五年的百分之五十六左右，提高到百分之六十到七十，从而保证我国的经济和文化教育事业的迅速发展。
    在分配国家基本建设投资的时候，应该保证工业和农业能够得到较高速度的发展。在投资总额中，工业投资所占的比重，可以由第一个五年的百分之五十八·二提高到百分之六十左右；农业、水利和林业的投资所占的比重，可以从第一个五年的百分之七·六提高到百分之十左右。此外，还应该注意安排运输和邮电部门，文化、教育、科学和保健部门，城市建设部门和商业部门等的投资，使它们保持适当的比例。
    在分配工业投资的时候，还应该在轻重工业之间进行适当的安排。第一个五年由于我国的轻工业还有很大的潜力，因此计划规定轻工业的投资占工业投资的百分之十一·二，在执行过程中略有增加，这样的比重是适当的。考虑到第二个五年人民消费水平的逐步提高，若干轻工业品的生产能力将要感到不足，我们认为，有必要适当地提高轻工业投资所占的比重。但是，由于某些轻工业企业的生产潜力，并没有充分地发挥出来，特别是大量的公私合营企业，经过改组安排以后，有可能进一步地增加生产，手工业在实现合作化以后，也将进一步增加生活消费品的生产，因此，我们在安排轻工业投资的时候，还应该考虑到这些因素。
    （二）正确地安排基本建设计划
    关于基本建设，除了上面已经说到的必须合理地分配投资以外，还应该注意以下的一些问题。
    第一，关于加强机器制造工业和冶金工业的建设问题
    在以重工业为中心的工业建设中，应该特别注意机器制造工业和冶金工业的建设。
    机器制造工业的发展，是建立我国完整的工业体系的主要环节之一。我国第一个五年计划期间，许多大型的精密的机器和成套设备都还不能够制造，这种状况使我国建设所需要的机器和设备有百分之四十左右依靠进口解决。因此，努力发展机器制造工业，特别是发展我们所需要而又缺乏的各种大型设备、重型机床、精密机床和仪表等制造业，是今后工业建设的一个重点。我们应该争取经过第二个五年计划的建设，使机器设备的自给率提高到百分之七十左右。
    冶金工业是重工业的基础，如果没有强大的冶金工业，机器制造工业的发展也是困难的。在第一个五年计划期间，我国生产的钢材大约只占国内需要量的百分之八十左右，而许多特殊品种的钢材，全部或者几乎全部要依靠进口解决。因此，努力发展冶金工业，是今后工业建设的另一个重点。我们应该争取经过第二个五年计划的建设，使钢材和主要的有色金属的数量和品种，都能够基本上满足国民经济各部门特别是机器制造工业部门的需要。
    在重工业各部门中，不仅机器制造工业和冶金工业需要努力发展，而且还有许多薄弱的环节需要加强，许多空白需要补足，例如，稀有金属的开采和提炼，有机合成化学工业的建立和发展，原子能的和平利用等等，都应该当作我们进行建设的重要方面，给以足够的注意。
    为了发展重工业，必须继续加强地质工作，并且使地质普查工作和重点勘探工作正确地结合起来，争取发现更多的新矿区和矿种，探明更多的矿产储量，以满足工业建设当前和长远的需要。
    第二，关于生产力分布问题
    为了合理地配置我国的生产力，促进各地区的经济发展，并且使我国工业的布局适合于资源和国防的条件，必须在内地有计划地建设新的工业基地。这是我们必须坚持的不可动摇的方针。加强内地工业的新建设，也将促进少数民族地区经济和文化的发展。在第二个五年计划期间，必须继续进行华中和内蒙古两地区以钢铁工业为中心的工业基地的建设，积极进行西南、西北和三门峡周围等地区以钢铁工业和大型水电站为中心的新工业基地的建设，继续进行新疆地区石油工业和有色金属工业的建设，并且加强西藏地区的地质工作，为发展西藏的工业准备条件。
    同时，我们必须充分地利用近海地区原有的工业基础。我们在内地进行工业建设所需要的原材料和设备，技术人材和资金，都需要近海城市原有工业基础的支援。可以说，近海地区原有的工业基础，是我国工业化的出发点。我们充分利用并且加强近海地区的工业基础，不但是为了适应国家和人民日益增长的需要，而且也正是为了在内地建立更强大的工业基础。在第二个五年计划期间，应该继续加强东北的工业基地，充分利用和适当加强华东、华北、华南各地区近海城市的工业，以发挥他们在国家建设中的作用。
    当然，我们在充分利用近海城市原有的工业基础的时候，应该注意合理性，避免盲目性。这种合理性就是：改建那些有必要也有可能改建的企业，而不是改建一切的原有企业；在工业企业已经比较多的城市，一般地应该少建新的企业；新建和改建的企业，必须注意到原料的来源、产品的销售、生产的技术和运输等条件，并且注意同其他地区的合理分工。
    在工业地点的分布问题上，不论是内地的工业或者近海地区的工业，我们的方针是既要适当分散，又要互相配合，反对过分集中和互不联系的两种偏向。
    随着工业生产力的合理分布，我们将要建设许多新的城市和扩建许多原有的城市，为此，应该加强城市的规划工作和建设工作，求得同工业建设相配合。
    第三，关于大型企业和中、小型企业的结合问题
    我们在第一个五年计划期间已经开工建设和在第二个五年计划期间将要开工建设的许多规模巨大的工业企业，是组成我国完整的工业体系的骨干。但是在建设大型企业的同时，还必须建设许多中、小型企业，以便在较短的时间内，能够增产更多的工业品，满足国家建设和人民生活的需要。
    有人认为，建设大型企业在经济上和技术上比较合理，因此应该多建大型企业而少建中、小型企业。又有人认为，建设中、小型企业需要的时间较短，发挥投资的效果较快，因此应该多建中、小型企业而少建大型企业。我们认为不能一概而论，某些工业部门和在某种条件下，建设大型企业是合理的，而另一些工业部门和在另一种条件下，建设中、小型企业就比较合理。在每一类企业中，一般地说都应该有一些大型的企业作为骨干，又应该有许多中、小型的企业来配合。
    为了使企业的建设更加合理起见，凡是有必要也有可能分期建设的大型企业，可以考虑分期建设；凡是资源有余并且有其他条件的中、小型企业，可以进行全面规划，为以后的发展预做准备。同时，在规划中、小型企业同大型企业相配合的时候，应该首先利用国营和公私合营的原有中、小型企业以及手工业，以发挥他们的生产潜力。
    （三）发展工业生产
    我国第一个五年计划规定，一九五七年比一九五二年，工业总产值（包括手工业产值在内）增长百分之九十·三；党中央委员会建议，一九六二年比一九五七年原计划，工业总产值应该增长一倍左右。在第二个五年计划期间，工业总产值的增长所以有可能保持比较高的速度，是因为：投入生产的新建和改建的企业将会增加，大多数原有企业将采取增产的技术措施或者进行技术改造，公私合营企业将要完成经济改组并且基本上实现国有化，手工业除了少数的以外，将完成合作化，同时，农业发展也有可能保持较高的速度。
    关于发展工业生产，我在这里只说下面几个问题。
    第一，关于发挥工业企业的生产潜力问题
    在我国工业总产值中，按照大体的计算，到一九五七年，由新建企业和改建企业所生产的，将占百分之十五左右；而到一九六二年，由第一个五年和第二个五年内完工的新建企业和改建企业所生产的，将占百分之五十左右。因此，加强组织工作，充分发挥这类企业的作用，对发展工业生产有重要的意义。
    新建和改建的企业特别是重工业企业，从开工生产到达到设计的生产能力，是要有一段时间让技术人员和工人掌握机器和设备的性能、熟悉工艺过程的；但是，只要充分发挥技术人员、工人和职员的劳动热情和智慧，这个时间是可以缩短的，而且，设计文件上所规定的企业的生产能力，有些是可以超过的。根据一九五六年四月的统计，在一九五三年到一九五五年陆续投入生产的限额以上的一百四十一个工业建设单位中，已经提前达到并且超过设计能力的就有三十个，可以提前达到设计能力的有三十三个，可以按期达到设计能力的有七十一个，不能按期达到设计能力的只有七个。这就是说，大约有接近半数的企业，可以缩短时间而提前达到设计能力。在这方面的例子有：改建的沈阳风动工具厂，原估计要四年的时间才能够达到设计能力，实际上建成的第二年就达到了，预计一九五七年的生产量有可能超过设计能力一倍以上；新建的抚顺铝厂，在一九五五年初正式投入生产，当年的产量已经达到他的设计能力的百分之一百一十左右。可见新建和改建的企业，有很大的生产潜力。为了充分发挥这种潜力，首要的问题是加强生产准备工作，特别是人员培养、技术准备、组织协作和原材料供应等工作。关于这方面的具体经验，有关部门应该加以研究、总结和推广。
    但是决不能够说，有了新建和改建的企业，我们就可以不注意原有企业的生产了。在第二个五年计划期间，原有企业生产的产值在工业总产值中仍然占有相当大的比重，而且许多新建和改建的企业还需要依靠原有企业的协作和支援。我们应该根据具体条件，分别地采取不同的措施，对一部分企业有计划地进行改建或者进行技术改造，对另一部分企业进行调整和增添某些设备，对其余的企业继续改善经营管理，以进一步发挥原有企业的生产潜力。
    第二，关于推进工业生产的专业化和协作问题
    推进工业生产特别是重工业生产的专业化和协作，可以提高劳动生产率，降低生产成本和促进技术的发展。但是工业生产的专业化和协作，是一个比较复杂的问题，需要在一个相当长的时期内，随着我国工业水平的提高，并且结合我国的具体情况和可能条件，逐步地和分别地解决，不能盲目从事和勉强进行。在第一个五年计划期间，我们一方面充分发挥了原有的综合性工厂的作用，使他们的生产适应于国家建设和人民生活多方面的需要，另一方面，在机器制造工业中，开始按照产品种类建立了一些专业分工的工厂，同时调整了一些原来产品种类过于复杂的机器厂，使这些企业初步地走上了专业化，这都是完全必要的。在第二个五年计划期间，我们除了应该新建一些专业化的工厂以外，对于各类新建和改建的企业，应该对他们的产品方案进行合理的安排，既要避免产品种类过于复杂的缺点，又要避免不适当地追求专业化的偏向。对于原有企业，我们一方面应该适当地调整某些企业的产品方案，使生产比较合理，另一方面仍旧应该保留一部分综合性工厂。对于大部分公私合营的企业，我们应该让他们继续保留原有的产品种类，以适应社会多种多样的要求，并且适应国营企业对协作的需要。在一个工业区或者一个工业城市内，我们可以根据需要和可能，统一组织某些锻件、铸件和标准件的专业生产。在推进工业生产专业化的过程中，应该防止产品种类减少的偏向。
    随着工业生产逐步地向专业化方向发展，协作任务也就越加繁重和越加复杂。这就必须进一步纠正那种只愿单干不愿协作的思想。凡是必须协作和可以协作的企业，应该在年度计划中规定具体的协作任务和订立协作合同。
    第三，关于提高产品质量和增加产品品种问题
    许多工业产品、特别是某些轻工业产品质量不高和品种不多，已经成为当前工业发展中的一个突出的问题，并且对国家建设和人民生活已经造成了不好的影响。没有疑问，我们很多重工业产品和轻工业产品，质量是不断提高的，品种是不断增加的，但是并不是所有工业产品都如此，甚至某些产品质量在不断下降，品种在不断减少，这种现象必须大力加以纠正。
    工业产品质量低和品种少，固然在很大程度上是由于我国技术水平不高和设备落后的缘故，但是，这并不能够说我们就没有可能来提高我国工业品的质量和增加工业品的品种，更不能够以此做为质量下降和品种减少的借口。我们有些工业部门，对产品质量和产品品种没有予以应有的注意，缺乏长远的规划和有效的措施；在检查计划执行情况的时候，常常偏重于检查产量计划完成的情况，而忽视检查质量计划和新种类产品生产计划完成的情况；产量超过计划有奖励，质量提高了和种类增加了却得不到奖励。所有这些，都是造成我国当前工业产品质量低和品种少的重要原因。除此以外，在轻工业产品方面，工厂所生产的成品，过去由商业部门包购包销；质量好的和质量不好的、新产品和旧产品都是一个价格，或者价格相差很少。这些制度和办法，也都助长了企业忽视产品质量和产品品种的偏向。因此，在当前和第二个五年计划期间，各个工业部门，应该制定出工业技术的长远发展规划，积极地组织产品设计的力量和加强对新产品设计和试制工作的领导，加强企业的技术管理工作，改善原材料的供应工作，实行产品质量奖励制度；特别是应该发动广大职工群众，为提高产品质量和增加产品品种而努力。同时，商业部门应该逐步地实行某些商品的选购制度和按质分等论价的办法。
    （四）发展农业生产
    党中央委员会在关于第二个五年计划的建议中提出：粮食产量五年合计达到二万二千亿斤左右，一九六二年达到五千亿斤左右；棉花产量五年合计达到二亿一千万担左右，一九六二年达到四千八百万担左右。一九六二年比一九五七年原计划，农业总产值增长百分之三十五左右。这些指标是考虑了下面两方面的情况提出的：一方面，除了个别的地区以外，农业将会完成高级形式的合作化，这样我们就能够进一步按照“一九五六年到一九六七年全国农业发展纲要”（草案）的规定，广泛地采取各种增产的措施和推广各种增产的经验；同时，灌溉面积和耕地面积将会有所扩大，化学肥料的供应将会有所增加，生产工具和耕作技术将会有所进步，这些，都将促进农业生产的进一步发展。另一方面，各种自然灾害还都难于避免，许多为害严重的河流还不能得到根治，更大规模的垦荒工作还不能全面地展开，农业机械化的条件还没有具备，这些，又使我们对农业生产的发展，不能要求有更高的速度。当然，我们应该充分地利用上述的有利条件，争取农业生产在第二个五年计划期间得到更大的发展。
    关于发展农业生产，应该特别注意下面两个问题。
    第一，关于提高农作物的单位面积产量问题
    我国第二个五年计划期间农业增产的主要途径，是要在合作化的基础上，依靠农民的劳动积极性，逐步地改进农业生产的技术，兴修水利，增加肥料，推行先进经验等，来提高单位面积产量。在实行各种增产措施的时候，我们又必须采取国家的工作和合作社的工作互相结合的方针。
    从兴修水利说，一方面，应该由国家和地方举办若干大、中型的水利工程，如黄河、淮河、海河等流域的治本工程和各地方的防洪、防涝工程；另一方面，应该由合作社大量地举办小型的水利工程，改善原有的水利设施，加强水土保持的工作。在低洼易涝的地区，应该研究和进行各种防涝、排涝的措施，改变耕作制度，以减轻内涝的损害。
    从增加肥料说，一方面，应该由国家积极发展肥料工业，并且争取多进口一些化学肥料，以增加肥料的供应；另一方面，而且是主要的方面，应该由合作社和社员个人广泛地养猪积肥，有些地方是养羊积肥，并且制造绿肥和积聚其他的自然肥料。
    从推行各种技术措施和先进增产经验说，应该积极开展技术指导工作，一方面，吸收外来的先进增产经验，并且根据科学的试验和研究的成果，因地制宜地加以推广；另一方面，也应该积极注意总结和推广当地的先进增产经验。
    这里我们还要特别地指出，推行技术改进的措施和推广先进经验，必须采取积极而又慎重的步骤。这几年来在这个工作方面取得了很大的成绩，但是也有些地方发生了机械地搬运甚至强制推广的毛病，造成了不好的结果。今后任何增产的措施和先进的经验，不仅必须先经过试验，证明确实有效后再逐步推广，而且在推广的时候，还必须根据当时当地的具体条件，规定适当的实施步骤；同时，在推行这些措施和经验的时候，还应该征求当地农民特别是有经验的老年农民的意见，不应该强迫推行。对于当地的耕作习惯，也不应该粗率地加以否定。
    第二，关于发展多种农业经济问题
    粮食是保证人民生活和发展整个农业经济的基础，我们必须加以足够的注意。这几年来，各地方重视了粮食和棉花的增产，这是完全必要的。但是，有些地方却因而对其他农业经济——除棉花以外的各种经济作物、畜牧业、林业、水产养殖业、蚕桑业和各种农家副业的增产注意得不够，加上有些农业产品和土特产品受了收购价格偏低的影响，结果使农业经济不能够全面地和充分地发展，从而影响到整个国民经济的发展，影响到农民的收入。因此，各地方以至每个农业生产合作社在规划自己生产的时候，都应该根据当地的历史情况和当前情况、自然条件和经济技术条件、农民的生产习惯和生活习惯等等，对农业的发展进行全面规划，以免发生单一化和片面化的倾向。在畜牧区、林区和水产区，应该分别以畜牧业、林业或者水产业为中心进行规划，同时根据可能的条件发展农业和其他副业。
    为了促进农业经济的全面发展，我们必须采取一些具体办法。凡是农民有经营习惯而又为社会所需要的各种生产，应该继续经营并且加以发展。凡是社会迫切需要、特别是有重大经济价值的产品，例如亚热带作物和热带作物、出口需要的各种农产品和副产品，除由国家或者地方统一经营以外，还应该鼓励合作社经营，由国家进行技术指导。凡是不必要由合作社统一经营的农家副业，应该鼓励社员单独经营。商业部门应该合理地规定农业产品和副业产品的收购价格，并且改善收购制度，同时，有关部门应该帮助合作社适当地恢复农村中的某些农产品加工业。
    （五）发展运输业和邮电业
    在第二个五年计划期间，随着工农业生产的发展，基本建设规模的扩大，内地和边远地区的开发和建设，都需要大大地增加运输和通讯的能力，要求我们必须以铁路为重点，相应地进行全国运输网和通讯网的建设。这就向运输和邮电部门提出了巨大的要求：一方面，应该对原有线路和设备进行必要的改建和技术改造，另一方面，应该继续进行新的线路的建设，主要是西北和西南两个地区的铁路、公路的建设，沿海、长江的港口的建设，同时，还应该增加必要的运输和通讯的设备。运输和邮电部门应该根据上述两方面的要求，分别轻重缓急，进行全面规划，以保证完成第二个五年计划建议中所提出的关于运输、邮电方面的各项任务。
    目前，在某些线路上已经出现了运输和通讯的紧张状态，这主要是由于设备能力不足所造成，但是也应该看到，某些运输和通讯的线路和设备，还存在着一定的潜在能力没有被发掘出来。因此，运输和邮电部门，还应该积极地采取有效的技术措施和加强运输、通讯的组织工作。
    由于我国近代运输工具不足，运输线路不够，并且分布得很不平衡，而我国现有的木帆船和兽力车等民间运输工具数量大，分布广，在相当长的时间内，还是重要的辅助运输力量，在有些地区，目前还是主要的运输力量，因此，我们应该充分利用和适当发展民间运输工具，并且逐步地对他们进行技术改良。在可能的条件下，我们还应该把近代运输工具同民间运输工具结合使用，以适应运输增长的需要。
    （六）加强商业工作
    改善人民生活，不仅要增加人民的货币收入，而且要使他们能够买到相当数量的和合乎需要的商品。根据大体的计算，一九六二年供应城乡人民的各种日常生活消费品和一部分生产资料的数量，即社会商品零售总额，将比一九五七年原计划增长百分之五十左右。这是商业部门的一项繁重的任务。商业部门必须继续加强收购工作和销售工作，继续贯彻执行对主要生活必需品的统购统销政策，合理地设置商业网，并且有计划地组织一部分在国家领导下的自由市场，以满足人民日益增长的需要。从对外贸易方面说，应该有计划地组织有关物资的出口，以保证国家建设所必需的设备和器材的进口。
    商业作为联系生产和消费、工业生产和农业生产的纽带，它不仅担负着满足居民生活需要和一部分生产需要的任务，担负着为国家积累资金的任务，而且也担负着促进工农业生产发展的任务。由于价值规律在我国经济生活中还起着一定的作用，在某些方面更起着重要的作用。因此，正确地运用价值规律，正确地掌握物价政策，就可以促进工农业生产的发展。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我国市场的物价一般是稳定的，工业品和农产品之间的比价大体是适当的，这就表明，我们的物价政策是正确的，他促进了工农业生产和国家建设的发展，并且保证了社会主义改造的顺利进行。但是，在物价政策的执行方面还存在着一些缺点和错误，主要是：有些农产品和土特产品的收购价格定得偏低，或者有时高有时低，影响到这些产品的增产，甚至使某些产品发生了减产的现象；某些轻工业产品在质量和品种方面的差价太小，影响到这些产品质量的提高和品种的增加。这些缺点，都已经发现并且逐步地进行了纠正，但是还没有完全克服，需要进一步加以研究和调整。
    正确地掌握物价政策是一件极其复杂的事情，在我们这样一个人口众多和经济情况比较复杂的国家里，对物价的调整必须采取十分慎重的态度，而不能轻率从事。例如，不适当地提高农产品的收购价格，对于工业生产和工人生活，对于保持各种农产品之间正确的发展比例，都会有不利的影响；不适当地降低工业品的销售价格，有可能引起商品的脱销。因此，这种不适当的提价或者降价，都将不利于工农业生产的发展和人民生活的改善。在第二个五年计划期间，我们在物价方面将继续采取稳定的政策，同时，对某些不合理的物价进行必要的适当的调整。
    由于社会主义改造事业的胜利，社会主义经济已经在我国占居了绝对的统治地位，这就使我们有可能在适当的范围内，更好地运用价值规律，来影响那些不必要由国家统购包销的、产值不大的、品种繁多的工农业产品的生产，以满足人民多样的生活需要。为了适应上述情况，防止发生统一过多过死而影响产品质量下降和品种减少的现象，现在和在第二个五年计划期间，我们在商业方面，将采取许多重要措施。例如，在国家统一市场的领导下，将有计划地组织一部分自由市场；在一定范围内，将实行产品的自产自销；对某些日用工业品将推行选购和按质分等论价办法，等等。采取这些措施，不仅不会破坏国家的统一市场，相反地，将会对国家的统一市场起有益的补充作用。
    （七）社会主义改造过程中的企业改组
        和人员安排
    在社会主义改造的工作方面，我只说以下两个问题。
    第一，关于中小公私合营企业和手工业、小商业的合作组织的企业改组问题　　大型的公私合营企业，因为合营的时间大多比较早，他们的生产和经营已经逐步地纳入了国家计划的轨道，经营管理制度也一般地进行了初步的改造。但是大量分散的中小型的新公私合营企业，还需要进行适当的改组和安排。许多个体手工业和小商小贩在实现合作化以后，也需要进行必要的改组和安排。这样，才能使他们在比较合理的条件下进行生产和经营，以逐步地适应国家的计划管理的要求。但是我们在对他们进行改组的时候，必须注意防止和纠正过分集中的偏向。
    从工业方面说，小型工厂固然有它的缺点，但是他们在生产经营方面比较机动灵活，容易适应多样的、经常变化的需要，因此，凡是经营合理并且能够适应社会需要的小型工厂，都应该保存下来，不应该草率地加以合并或者取消。手工业合作组织一般地不宜过分集中，应该根据发展生产、适应社会需要、增加社员收入的原则，使大社、小社、小组同时存在；某些制造性的行业，特别是许多修理性、服务性的行业，都应该让他们继续保持分散活动和原有的经营特点，以便于直接为居民服务，同时便于吸收家庭辅助劳动参加生产。有些手工业可以在手工业合作组织的领导下，继续独立生产，也可以让他们完全自产自销，不必勉强组织起来。
    从商业方面说，商业机构的分布应该最大限度地便利居民，因此更不应该过分集中，而应该适当分散，并且采取多样的经营方式，为居民服务。我们的商业领导机关，过去往往多考虑自己管理的方便，而少考虑如何便利居民，因而发生了集中过多的偏向，不适当地集中了和取消了一些小商店和小商贩。这种偏向，应该迅速加以纠正。今后不论在城市居民区或者广大农村中，都应该保持相当数量的小商小贩，采取合作商店、合作小组、代销、甚至完全自购自销等等方式，更好地为居民服务。
    第二，关于工商业资本家和小业主的安排和改造问题
    在资本主义工商业实现公私合营以后，我们应该培养和提拔优秀的职工参加企业领导，同时还要吸收原来的工商业资本家和小业主，担负一部分经营管理工作或者领导工作。在实行公私合营和定息制度以后，资产阶级分子在企业中，具有资本家和职员的两重身分，因此，公股代表应该同这些资方人员很好地合作，发挥他们的特长和积极性，并且在工作的过程中，加强对他们的教育和改造，克服他们的资产阶级的思想和作风，帮助他们在工作中做出成绩，把他们逐渐改造成为名副其实的劳动者，而不应该对他们采取歧视的态度。这样做，对企业、对国家和对工人阶级都是有利的。为了做好这一工作，应该使企业中的职工懂得这个道理，把团结、教育和改造资方人员当作一件重要的任务。
    在公私合营企业中的几十万资方人员，绝大多数都有一些生产技术或者经营管理经验，其中有一些人有相当高的生产技术和相当多的经营管理经验。对于他们的生产技术和有用的经营管理经验，我们必须充分加以利用。公股代表在这方面应该很好地向他们学习。
    （八）改进国家行政体制，发挥地方的积极性
    在第二个五年计划期间，国家的许多建设事业将要更多地由地方负责兴办或者要依靠地方的努力配合来完成。因此，发挥地方的积极性，是我们完成社会主义建设事业的重要条件。
    现在，我国的社会主义改造已经取得了决定性的胜利，人民民主专政已经更加巩固，这就使我们有必要也有可能，按照统一领导、分级管理、因地制宜、因事制宜的方针，进一步地划分中央和地方的行政管理职权，改进国家的行政体制，以利于地方积极性的充分发挥。国务院在今年五月到八月曾经召开了全国体制会议，对于当前存在着的中央集权过多的现象作了检查，对改进国家行政体制问题进行了讨论，并且提出了关于改进国家行政体制的决议草案，现在正在广泛地征求各方面意见。
    在划分中央和地方的行政管理职权的时候，应该实行以下的原则：（1）明确地规定给予各省、自治区、直辖市有一定范围的计划、财政、企业、事业、物资、人事的管理权；（2）凡关系到整个国民经济而带全局性、关键性、集中性的企业和事业，由中央管理；其他的企业和事业，应该尽可能地多交给地方管理；企业和事业在下放的时候，同他们有关的计划、财务管理和人事管理一般地应该随着下放；（3）企业和事业的管理，应该认真地改进和推行以中央为主、地方为辅或者以地方为主、中央为辅的双重领导的管理方法，切实加强对企业和事业的领导；（4）中央管理的主要计划和财务指标，由国务院统一下达，改变过去许多主要指标由各部门条条下达的办法；（5）某些主要计划指标和人员编制名额等，应该给地方留一定的调整幅度和机动权；（6）对于民族自治地方各项自治权利，应该作出具体实施的规定，注意帮助少数民族地区政治、经济、文化事业的发展；（7）改进体制要逐步实现，某些重大的改变，应该采取今年准备、明年试办、到第二个五年计划期间全面实施的步骤，稳步进行。
    为了有效地实行上述的各项原则，我们认为，中心的问题是在中央的统一领导下，适当地扩大地方的权限。因为地方比中央更加接近企业和事业的基层单位，更加接近群众，也更加容易了解实际情况，适当地扩大地方的权限，就能够更好地把地方上的一切力量，一切积极因素，组织到社会主义建设事业中来。
    为了更大地发挥地方积极性和加强全国各族人民的团结，现在和在第二个五年计划期间，我们应该更加重视少数民族工作。凡是少数民族聚居的地区，应该成立自治地方而尚未成立的，都应该按照宪法规定，积极地帮助他们成立自治地方。应该严格尊重民族自治地方的各项自治权。应该大量培养和提拔民族干部，不断地提高他们的政治觉悟和管理各种事务的能力，使他们在工作中能够真正当家作主，有职有权。不论在少数民族聚居、杂居或者散居的地方，他们的民族平等权利、宗教信仰自由、风俗习惯和语言文字，都应该受到尊重。对于那些还没有文字或者文字尚不完善的少数民族，应该积极地帮助他们创制和改革自己民族的文字。
    （九）培养建设人材和加强科学研究工作
    在第二个五年计划期间，我们要建立社会主义工业化的巩固基础，进行国家建设和推进国民经济的技术改造，就必须努力培养建设人材，加强科学研究工作。
    第一，关于建设人材的培养和分配问题
    为国家培养各项建设人材，首先是工业技术人材和科学研究人材，是教育工作的首要任务。这几年来，我国培养建设人材的工作是有显著进展的，但是从国家建设的要求来看，我们在高等学校和中等专业学校所培养的人材，在数量上、尤其是在质量上和门类上，还难以满足需要。因此，在第二个五年计划期间，应该进一步发展高等教育和中等专业教育，并且根据“掌握重点、照顾其他”及需要和可能相结合的方针，进行全面规划。
    要做好建设人材的培养工作，必须正确地处理数量和质量的关系。过去几年，我们有片面强调数量、忽视质量的偏向，这是必须纠正的。从教育部门说，应该积极地发挥力量，在保证一定质量的条件下尽可能地增加学生的数量。从用人部门说，应该考虑到真正需要和实际可能，不要提出过多过高的要求，以免由于盲目地增加数量而降低学生质量。
    高等教育和中等专业教育应该实事求是地而不是主观主义地调整科系和设置专业，切合实际地改进教育计划、教学大纲、教材和教学方法，以便使培养的人材能够更加适应于国民经济各部门的具体要求。目前发展和提高高等教育和中等专业教育最大的困难，是缺乏师资和学生质量不高。因此，必须从高等学校毕业学生中间抽调适当数量的优秀学生，培养更多数量的研究生，并且有重点地选派高等学校的毕业生和教师出国学习我们缺乏的学科，以增加师资。同时，必须相应地发展和办好高级中学和初级中学，以提高学生的质量。高等学校和中等专业学校现有的图书和仪器一般都还不够，应该逐步地加以补充；这些学校在发展中所必需的校舍，也应该给以解决。
    培养建设人材还必须发展业余教育，从职工中吸收有条件深造的人员到夜校或者函授学校去学习，逐步地培养他们成为高级和中级的专门人材。学习必须真正出于本人自愿，并且要分批分期地进行；各单位要保证学习的人有必要的业余学习时间，学习的时间不要太长，学习不要过紧，以免妨碍生产和职工的健康。
    在科学技术人材不足的情况下，对建设人材的合理分配就更加重要。在分配建设人材的时候，对生产、建设的需要和科学研究、师资增加的需要，都应该首先保证重点，同时照顾其他方面；并且应该继续纠正那种对科学技术人材分配不当、用非所学和积压人材的浪费现象。
    第二，关于加强科学研究工作问题
    最近在党中央和国务院的直接领导下，集合了全国几百名优秀的科学家，草拟了今后十二年的全国科学技术发展规划和哲学社会科学发展规划，分别地提出了自然科学和社会科学最重要的研究任务。这是提高科学研究工作，保证我国许多重要的科学和技术方面在今后十二年内能够接近世界上先进水平的极重要的措施，应该在党中央和国务院的领导下早日完成这两个规划，并且组织全国科学研究的力量，有步骤地实现这两个规划所提出的任务。由于需要解决的科学和技术的任务十分繁重，现有的科学研究人材不足，而现代科学和技术又在一日千里地发展着，也由于当前我国科学研究的重点，大都是我们工作中的薄弱环节，甚至是缺门，因此，我们应该集中力量，首先解决重要方面的问题，防止百废俱兴、平均使用力量的偏向。
    为了加强科学研究工作，必须逐步地建立和健全中国科学院和各业务部门的科学研究机构，加强高等学校的科学研究工作，并且做到各方面分工合作，密切结合。科学研究机构的设置，应该在地区上求得合理的分布。科学研究工作应该同国家的各项建设工作、特别是经济建设工作密切结合起来。在科学研究中，要贯彻执行“百家争鸣”的方针，鼓励学术上的自由讨论，以充分发挥科学研究人员的积极性和创造性。
    为了发展我国的科学研究事业，还应该及时地解决必需的图书、资料、仪器和试验场所等问题，积极地改善科学研究人员的工作条件，并且进一步地密切国际间科学的联系和合作，收集和交换国内外科学和技术的资料。
    （十）进一步改善人民生活
    第二个五年计划期间，在发展生产和增加国民收入的基础上，我们有可能进一步改善人民的生活。
    从根本上说，我们国家所进行的一切建设，都是为了人民群众的福利。但是，在建设的过程中，人民的长远利益和当前利益之间，集体利益和个人利益之间，是常常不容易安排得好的。因此，我们必须妥善地安排国民收入中积累和消费的比例关系，在保证国家建设规模逐步扩大的同时，使人民生活得到逐步的改善。
    在这里，我要着重地说明以下的问题：
    第一，关于改善职工物质生活问题
    在第二个五年计划期间，职工的平均工资将提高百分之二十五到三十。这样的增长速度，同我国经济发展的水平和劳动生产率增长的速度是相适应的。根据前面所说的经验，我们必须在年度计划中，经常地注意保持工资增长同劳动生产率增长之间的适当比例关系，使职工的工资水平能够随着劳动生产率的提高，比较均衡地上升。并且，在规定各个年度的职工工资增长计划的时候，还应该注意到生活消费品生产和供应的可能性，以避免工资增长同物资供应发生脱节的现象。
    为了改善职工的物质生活，除了进一步提高职工工资水平以外，现在和在第二个五年计划期间，还应该根据可能的情况，采取实际措施，逐步地改善职工居住、安全、医药卫生等方面的条件和适当地增加其他的福利设施。在这方面，国务院已经拟定了若干具体措施，并且将在最近期间公布施行。
    我们应该继续反对对职工生活漠不关心的官僚主义态度。事实上，有许多增加职工福利的设施之所以没有举办，并不是完全因为缺乏财力和物力的条件，主要是由于某些主管部门的领导人员对职工生活的改善，采取了官僚主义的态度。应该指出，有一些福利事业是不需要增加国家预算的开支就可以举办的。只要我们能够克服官僚主义的作风，更多地关心群众生活，并且认真地执行国家的计划和各种规定，那么我们就一定能够把改善职工的物质生活这样一件重要的事情，办得更好。
    第二，关于改善农民物质生活问题
    为了改善农民的物质生活，一方面，我们应该注意调整国家积累和合作社收入的比例关系，正确地解决农民的负担问题；另一方面，我们还应该注意调整农业生产合作社内部的公共积累和社员个人收入的比例关系，正确地解决合作社收益的分配问题。在第二个五年计划期间，国家的农业税应该保持在一个适当的比例上，并且将把农业税的正税和附加税统一征收，以简化税制；同时，我们要求所有的合作社贯彻执行“高级农业生产合作社示范章程”的规定，使公积金、公益金和管理费用一般地不要超过章程上的比例定额。这样，在第二个五年计划期间，如果能够完成农业的增产计划，就有可能使农民的全部收入在五年内增长百分之二十五到三十。
    在第二个五年计划期间，国家将继续从各个方面来帮助农业生产合作社发展生产，对水利建设和农业的投资将比第一个五年计划有很大的增加，农业贷款也将有所增加；同时，国家仍将规定一部分专款作为农村救灾的用途。对于许多自然条件不好的山区和老根据地，今后国家应该特别注意帮助当地人民发展生产，改善生活。
    第三，关于提高人民文化生活水平问题
    在第二个五年计划期间，随着经济建设的发展和人民群众对于文化要求的增长，我们应该按照建议规定，继续努力扫除文盲，发展小学教育，开展工农群众的业余教育，逐步推行文字改革。同时，还应该进一步开展群众的文化工作，发展新闻、出版、广播、文学、艺术、电影等事业。在举办这些事业的时候，应该特别注意质量的提高。
    在广大人民群众中进行文化教育工作，必须采取积极而又稳妥的步骤。几年来，我们在扫除文盲、小学教育、社会文化和出版等项工作中，都曾经发生过或者保守、或者冒进的毛病，使工作受到了不应有的损失。今后我们必须吸取这一教训，根据需要和可能，实事求是地开展文化教育工作。
    开展群众的文化教育工作，必须充分地依靠群众的力量，采取群众路线的工作方法。过去文化教育工作常常有包办代替、强迫命令的毛病，今后必须加以纠正。要在工作中坚持群众自愿的原则，凡事都要和群众商量。对于那些真为群众所需要、确有条件和群众自愿举办的事业，如民校、识字班、俱乐部、业余剧团等，我们应该给以支持和帮助，并且加强领导。当然，在运用群众力量的时候，必须经常注意爱惜民力和时间，不要随便增加人民的负担。
    第四，关于增进人民健康问题
    在第二个五年计划期间，必须继续发展卫生医疗事业，进一步开展体育运动，并且适当地提倡节制生育。
    几年来，爱国卫生运动在改善环境卫生、减少疾病方面起了重大的作用。但是近年来，我们对爱国卫生运动的领导有些放松，今后应该继续大力开展这一运动，并且使它更加深入和经常化，以进一步改进城市和乡村的环境卫生，减少各种传染病和职业病的发病率。同时，我们还应该积极推广治疗血吸虫病的经验，有计划地分期分区地消灭危害严重的地方病。全国城乡的基层医疗组织，在预防和治疗疾病方面，已经起了重大的作用，今后卫生部门应该加强对他们的领导。
    在医疗卫生事业方面目前还存在着许多缺点，例如：在医院工作中，由于管理不善，收费较高，因此使目前有限的病床不能得到充分利用，而且使有些群众看不起病，住不起医院；疗养病床缺乏统一管理，造成很大浪费；此外在公费医疗制度和医务工作制度等方面也还有不适当的地方。为了消除这些不合理的现象，卫生部门应该认真地调查研究，提出切实可行的改进办法。
    我们应该在广大群众中进一步开展体育运动，有效地增强人民的体质，并且提高我国体育运动的水平。在开展体育运动的时候，必须根据人民群众的生产、工作、学习的具体情况和体质条件，有区别地和有步骤地进行，避免要求过高过急和一般化的毛病。
    为了保护妇女和儿童，很好地教养后代，以利民族的健康和繁荣，我们赞成在生育方面加以适当的节制。卫生部门应该协同有关方面对于节育问题进行适当的宣传，并且采取有效的措施。
    （十一）继续厉行节约
    克勤克俭是我国人民的优良传统。一切国家机关、国营企业、事业单位和合作社，都应该厉行节约，使人力、物力、财力都能够充分发挥作用，以加速我国社会主义的建设事业。
    一年以前，党中央和国务院曾经号召全体国家机关工作人员和全国人民厉行节约，反对浪费，克服非生产性建设过多、生产性建设成本过高、工程和产品质量不好、物资损耗很大、以及机构庞大和人浮于事等等不良现象，经过一年多的努力，已经取得了相当的成绩。但是，应该指出，节约的方针并不是在一切部门中都贯彻得很好的，浪费现象仍然存在；同时，在厉行节约和反对右倾保守思想的过程中，由于片面的节约观点，或者由于只追求多和快、不重视好和省的偏向，使工程和产品的质量也发生了不少的问题，有些要返工重修，有些会降低效用，甚至变成废品，这样，不仅不能够达到节约的目的，反而又造成了浪费。
    在第二个五年计划期间，由于国家建设规模的扩大，我们在物资供应、资金来源和技术力量等方面，还会遇到很多的困难，而厉行节约，合理地使用物力、财力和人力，正是克服这些困难的一项重要办法。应该承认，计划的好坏，对于节约或者浪费起着重大的作用。计划所造成的节约是最大的节约，计划所造成的浪费是最大的浪费。因此，各级国家机关和企业部门应该首先做好计划工作。一切企业单位，都应该加强定额管理工作，推行各种合理的先进定额；加强技术管理工作，提高产品和工程的质量，减少废品、次品和工程质量事故；贯彻执行责任制度，克服无人负责的现象，以防止浪费和发挥节约的潜力。一切事业单位，都应该减少不必要的事业开支和人员编制，加强财务管理和稽核工作，以缩小事业经费在预算中的比重。一切合作社，都应该继续贯彻执行勤俭办社的方针。
    在国家行政机关方面，应该继续克服机构重叠和人浮于事的现象。现在，在各级国家行政机关中，一般地说，机构都还过于庞大，人员还是过多，而这种现象，上级机关比下级机关严重，大机关比小机关严重。我们必须采取有效措施，对各级机构和机关人员继续进行调整，精简行政机构，把机关人员适当下放，把非生产人员调往生产单位。这是目前在国家机关方面实行节约方针的有效办法。（十二）加强同苏联和各人民民主国家的团结和协作，扩大国际间经济、技术和文化的合作和联系
    为了完成我们的社会主义建设事业，我们除了调动国内的一切积极因素以外，还必须团结国际上一切可能团结的力量，争取国际上的一切有利条件。我们一贯努力加强同伟大苏联的团结，同各人民民主国家的团结，并且同他们进行全面协作和互相支援。我们也努力发展同那些不同社会制度的各国、特别是同亚非各国的经济合作、贸易来往、文化和技术的交流。
    我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的互助协作关系，是建立在牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊的基础上，并且以促进社会主义各国经济的共同高涨、不断提高社会主义各国人民的物质福利和文化水平为目的的。
    如前所说，不论是在我们恢复国民经济的时期，或者是在我们执行发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的时期，我国都在各方面获得了苏联的巨大的和真诚的援助，同时，也获得了各兄弟国家的重大的援助。这种援助，帮助我们克服了许多困难，使我国的社会主义建设事业能够以比较高的速度向前发展。在第二个五年计划期间，苏联和各人民民主国家还将继续给予我们兄弟般的大规模的援助，特别是那些由苏联和许多人民民主国家帮助我们设计和装备的大企业，将为我国社会主义工业化进一步奠定基础。过去，我们在学习苏联和各人民民主国家先进的建设经验和科学技术方面，得到很多好处，今后我们还必须同样虚心地向他们学习。
    作为社会主义阵营的一员，我国负有自己的一分责任，我们必须很好地尽这分责任。我们有义务向各兄弟国家供应他们在建设中所需要的许多农产品、畜产品、矿物原料以及某些机器设备和工业产品。我们必须努力增产，或者适当节约国内的消费，来保证这些产品的供应。为了同其他国家进行平等互利、互通有无的贸易，我们也有必要妥善地计划我们国内的生产和消费，以便保证必要的出口。
    几年来，我国同许多亚非国家在经济、技术和文化各方面的合作和联系日益密切。特别是从亚非会议以来，这种合作和联系有了更广泛的发展。我们绝大多数亚非国家都迫切要求消除长期殖民统治所造成的经济和文化的落后，因此深刻地体会到彼此在经济上和文化上进行合作的必要。我国一贯主张在平等互利不附加任何条件的基础上同亚非国家进行这种合作，在经济上和技术上促进彼此的独立发展，在文化上发扬各自的特长并且互相观摩学习。这种合作有助于保障亚非各国的民族独立和扩大和平地区，因此也就有利于我国的和平建设。尽管这种合作的范围现在还不很大，但是，重要的是亚非各国已经开始合作，并且正在扩大同拉丁美洲各国的联系，而这种合作和联系毫无疑义是有广阔的发展前途的。
    我们也愿意根据平等互利的原则，同世界上其他的国家发展经济上、技术上和文化上的联系。我们一直在努力扩大同西方国家的贸易，并且愿意把这些国家的科学技术和管理方法中有用的东西吸收过来，为我们的建设事业服务。尽管美国对我们实行禁运，并且强制许多国家对我们采取同样的政策，但是这个彻底违反各国人民利益的政策，已经遭到各方面日益强烈的反对。这个不合理的人为障碍，迟早是会被扫除的。
    我们主张扩大国际间经济、技术和文化的合作和联系，不仅是为了加速完成我们的社会主义建设，而且还因为这将为各国之间的和平共处奠定可靠的基础。因此，这是完全符合于全世界人民的利益，完全符合于和平事业的利益的。

    同志们：第一个五年计划胜利完成和第二个五年计划开始的日子，已经不远了。在今后一年多的时间里，全党同志，应该在党的中央委员会和毛泽东同志的领导下，加倍努力，同全国工人、农民、知识分子一起，同全国各民族、各党派、一切爱国人士一起，为超额完成第一个五年计划和积极准备第二个五年计划而奋斗。只要我们谦虚谨慎，不骄不躁，纠正我们工作中的主观主义思想和官僚主义作风，我们就能够动员一切力量，克服各种困难，在把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义工业强国的奋斗中，胜利前进！
