    The Troubles of Substitute Teachers
  　Shan Jia
    A substitute teacher in Shanghai, who graduated from a university and a night school of finance and economics, said: "Although I haven't left work by teaching in various middle schools as a substitute, I haven't had a fixed position. Some people like me are so envious of others who have fixed jobs!" A letter from a group of substitute teachers in Zhenjiang stated that their work is in a state of "being called upon when needed and dismissed when not needed."
    In large, medium, and small cities, there are now a small number of teachers who work as substitute teachers. Some middle and primary schools, because teachers take sick leave, maternity leave, or for other reasons, have vacancies, and they apply to fill them; once the original teacher returns, they have no work and have to wait for an opportunity to substitute in another school, with no guarantee of career or life. There are also some people who are nominally substitute teachers, but have been substituting in one or several schools continuously for one, two, or even three years. They cannot be transferred to formal teachers, nor can they enjoy the treatment and benefits that formal teachers should have. Their wages are lower than those of formal teachers, and no one cares about their work. They cannot improve their professional skills well, and so on.
    Why does this happen? The main reason is that some substitute teachers have been unemployed for a long time without employment, and some educational administrative departments believe that there are a group of temporary substitute teachers who can be called upon at any time, which is convenient to use, so they have not taken any specific measures to absorb some of the substitute teachers who are willing to engage in education and have teaching ability into the education team.
    Appropriately absorbing substitute teachers to participate in middle and primary school education is very necessary for the education department. With the development of national construction, there is an increasing sense of a shortage of intellectuals. A big problem in ordinary education is the serious shortage of teachers, which has become a major difficulty in developing ordinary education. Then, tapping social potential and absorbing these people to participate in education is one of the ways to expand the source of teachers and make up for the shortage of teachers.
    Absorbing these personnel to participate in work and continuing to train and transform them in their work is also beneficial to themselves and society. As early as August 1952, the "Decision of the Government Administration Council on Labor Employment Issues" pointed out: With the changes in the country's political economy, the thinking of unemployed intellectuals has also changed. Unemployed intellectuals should be widely absorbed, educated, transformed, and used. Some substitute teachers have improved their political thinking and teaching ability to a certain extent in the long-term substitute teaching process, and they are eager to participate in work. Therefore, it is more possible and necessary for relevant departments to consider this issue, appropriately absorb substitute teachers to formally participate in work, so that they can play their due role in teaching.

    代课教师的苦恼
  　山佳
    上海市一个大学肄业、财经学院夜校毕业的代课教师说：“我在各中学代课，虽然没有脱离工作，但一直没有固定的岗位。像我这样的一些人，是多么羡慕别人有了固定工作岗位啊！”镇江市署名一群代课教师的来信说，他们的工作，是处于“招之即来，挥之即去”的状况。
    在大、中、小城市里，现在都有一小部分以代课为职业的教师。一些中、小学校，因为教师请病假、产假，或者其他原因，教师有了缺额，他们就去应聘补缺；一旦原任教师回来，他们就没有工作，只好待机到另外的学校代课，职业、生活都没有保障。也有些人虽名义上是代课教师，但连续在一个或几个学校代课达一年、两年，甚至三年之久。他们既不能转为正式教师，也不能享受正式教师应有的待遇和福利，工资比正式教师低，工作也无人过问，不能很好进修业务，等等。
    为什么发生这样的情况呢？主要是有些代课教师长期失业没有就业，有些教育行政部门认为有这样一批临时代课教师，可随唤随到，使用起来方便，也就没有采取什么具体办法，将其中愿意从事教育工作而又有教学能力的一部分代课教师，吸收到教育队伍中来。
    适当吸收代课教师参加中、小学教育工作，对教育部门来说是非常需要的。随着国家建设事业的发展，愈来愈感到知识分子不足。普通教育事业当中一个很大的问题，就是师资严重的不足，这已成为发展普通教育事业的一个很大困难。那么，发掘社会潜力，吸收这些人参加教育工作，即是扩大师资来源、弥补教师不足的办法之一。
    吸收这些人员参加工作，继续在工作中训练改造他们，对于他们本身和社会也是有益的。早在1952年8月“政务院关于劳动就业问题的决定”中就已指出：随着国家政治经济的变化，失业知识分子的思想也有所变化，对现有失业知识分子应该广泛吸收、教育、改造、使用。有些代课教师，在长期代课过程中，政治思想和教学能力都有一定的提高，并且迫切地要求参加工作。所以，有关部门就更有可能和必要来考虑这个问题，适当吸收代课教师正式参加工作，使他们能够在教学上发挥应有的作用。
