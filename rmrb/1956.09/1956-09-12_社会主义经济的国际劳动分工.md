    The International Division of Labor in the Socialist Economy
    Gé·Gāsīdùn·Mǎlín (格·加斯顿·马林), Chairman of the Romanian State Planning Committee
    The Seventh Session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) of eight European countries was held in Berlin in May of this year. In addition to the participating countries, representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia also attended the meeting as observers.
    The meeting discussed the mutual coordination of the development of the main sectors of the national economy of the participating countries during the five-year plan period from 1956 to 1960. This meeting and the decisions it made are new proof of the profound friendship and fraternal consultation between socialist countries, and an example of the new type of relations peculiar to the world socialist system.
    The world socialist system, which emerged after the Second World War, is fundamentally different from the world capitalist system. In the capitalist economic system, the relations between countries are characterized, on the one hand, by the domination of certain imperialist powers, which exploit backward countries and try to keep them in a subordinate position forever; and on the other hand, by fierce competition for raw materials, markets, and spheres of influence. The relations between the countries of the socialist world system are based on the full equality of rights of all countries, large and small, and on mutual assistance and cooperation between them.
    The new characteristics of the relations between socialist countries are inextricably linked to the essence of these countries' economic and social systems. Political unity, the convergence of current goals, and the ultimate goal of building a communist society determine the possibility and necessity of their economic and political cooperation, which will help overcome the obstacles they encounter on the road of social and economic development.
    Various forms of economic ties have now been established between socialist countries.
    Under the capitalist system, Romania was purely an agricultural raw material supplier to Central and Western European countries, and an importer of industrial manufactured goods (including means of production and consumer goods). The economy of Bulgaria was also the same.
    Now, due to the development of these countries' industries, in addition to several original traditional ties, some new forms have also emerged. For example, Romania today supplies oil equipment to countries such as Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and China.
    During the first five-year plan period, the economic cooperation of the COMECON member countries mainly took the form of trade. Practice has shown that this form is no longer sufficient and needs to be utilized in new and richer forms in order to implement closer ties in the economic development process of each country.
    Foreign trade agreements are somewhat restrictive; they neither allow for coordination in the basic construction plans of various economic sectors, nor do they make it possible for countries to specialize and cooperate in production. In other words, foreign trade agreements are an insufficient form of cooperation for the requirements of the proportionate development of the economies of socialist countries.
    The planned development of the socialist international division of labor enables each country to develop its economy as rationally as possible through such forms: appropriately utilizing its own raw material resources, developing processing industries that have favorable economic conditions, and not developing other industrial sectors where economic prerequisites are insufficient.
    As already pointed out in the communique of the COMECON Berlin meeting, during the next five-year plan period, Poland, which has the largest coalfields and the most favorable mining conditions, will expand its coal mining industry to a considerable scale in order to supply fuel and coking coal to other countries in the socialist camp. This will enable some of its neighboring countries to free up a considerable portion of resources, because it would not be cost-effective to use these forces to develop the coal mining industry as well.
    As everyone knows, some iron ore deposits in the European People's Democracies are lean iron ore, and it is not economically advantageous to mine this iron ore and use it to make iron. On the other hand, the Soviet Union has large quantities of high-quality iron ore. The meeting communique pointed out that the Soviet Union will develop its iron ore mining volume to meet the increasing needs of the People's Democracies for iron ore.
    Similarly, the meeting paid full attention to the issue of supplying electricity to the national economies of the participating countries. With the participation of experts from various countries, a work plan has been drafted to connect the power grids in order to exchange electricity and promote regional division of labor in the power industry.
    The socialist division of labor on an international scale also requires the implementation of specialization of production through all effective economic forms. Specialization in the socialist economic system is not only focusing on the development of certain industrial sectors, but also specializing in the production of certain major mechanical industrial product parts in each relevant sector. At the Berlin meeting, the countries concerned adopted suggestions on production levels and mutual supply of basic types of machinery and equipment. In addition, measures were taken to expand the specialization of machinery and optical instruments between countries, and to ensure further technological development.
    The planned implementation of production specialization will enable countries to reduce the production of the same type of products, and reduce the types of machinery and equipment produced by each country. For example, the fourteen types of machines originally produced in Romania will be reduced to six. After the implementation of this specialization, it will be possible to increase the production of new varieties, improve existing varieties, and reduce their costs.
    Because Romania's oil industry has been highly developed, and its production volume and production experience have grown, it has been decided to specialize in the development of its modern deep-well drilling equipment during the second five-year plan period. This year we will supply many of these equipments to the People's Republic of China. At the same time, Romania will continue to expand its oil industry in the coming years to meet the needs of other socialist countries.
    Due to the same abundant resource conditions, Romania will also greatly expand its chemical industry in the next five years, increasing the products of synthetic rubber, cellulose, nitrogen fertilizer, soda products, plastic fabrics and synthetic fabrics, some of which will be used to supply the needs of fraternal countries that lack the necessary raw materials to develop the production of these sectors.
    It is obvious that this international division of labor and specialization of production cannot be established on the basis of trade agreements, but only on the basis of the mutual coordination of the long-term national economic plans of the COMECON member countries.
    The mutual coordination of economic development plans helps to make the most rational use of existing production capacity, avoid repeated establishment of new industrial enterprises, and utilize the corresponding production capacity of other participating countries to meet their own needs. As a result, the investment of each country will be more rationally and effectively utilized.
    In addition, the mutual coordination of long-term plans will help to carry out certain construction projects (such as jointly developing and utilizing the water resources of the Danube River). These projects cannot be completed by individual countries, because they require extremely large amounts of investment and involve many countries.
    The mutual coordination of long-term plans can also promote scientific and technological cooperation between countries. The COMECON Berlin meeting also took measures to improve the organization of economic and scientific and technological cooperation, and establish new organizational forms, so that the relevant departments of the participating countries can conduct direct, regular, and effective contacts with each other.
    This contact will accelerate and increase the exchange of experience in the production field, and help the introduction and promotion of the latest scientific and technological achievements of various countries. In addition, it can also save considerable technical strength, make the creative power of scientists and technicians in each country more effectively utilized, and avoid duplication in scientific and technological research and expand the scope of research. It can be predicted that the implementation of the Berlin meeting's resolutions will greatly promote the technological development of various socialist countries.
    Socialist international division of labor and mutual coordination of long-term plans do not mean the isolated development of the socialist economic system. On the contrary, socialist countries hope and are prepared to continue to develop trade relations and economic cooperation with all countries with different economic and political systems.
    In the past five years, our country's trade volume with capitalist countries has increased by nearly two and a half times. We hope to develop this trade on the basis of equal mutual benefit without any discrimination. However, the development of trade with all countries does not only depend on our side; it also depends on the other side.
    It should be pointed out that the rapid development of trade between socialist countries and Asian and African countries is meaningful and gratifying in this respect.
    We are striving to develop trade with capitalist countries, not because this trade is an indispensable condition for the development of socialist countries. Facts have proved that even under the conditions of trade discrimination and blockade imposed by Western countries, socialist countries can still successfully organize all the production they need within the socialist system.
    In any case, we are convinced that the historical reality will force certain groups in capitalist countries that still remain stubbornly unyielding to take the path of peaceful coexistence and economic competition.
    The close cooperation and fraternal mutual assistance between countries in the socialist camp is an important event in the modern world. It opens up magnificent prospects for the development of the productive forces of these countries and for further improving the material and cultural lives of the people.

    社会主义经济的国际劳动分工
    罗马尼亚国家计划委员会主席　格·加斯顿·马林
    欧洲八国经济互助委员会今年5月间在柏林举行了第七次会议。除了与会的各个国家以外，中华人民共和国和南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的代表也以观察员的身份参加了会议。
    会议所讨论的，是在从1956年到1960年这一个五年计划期间，与会各国国民经济各主要部门发展的相互配合的问题。这次会议和它所作出的决定，是社会主义国家之间深厚友谊和兄弟般的协商的新的证明，是世界社会主义体系所特有的新型关系的范例。
    第二次世界大战以后出现的世界社会主义体系，和世界资本主义体系有着根本的区别。在资本主义经济体系中，各国之间的关系，一方面是以某些帝国主义强国的统治为特征的，它们剥削落后国家，力图把这些国家永远保持着从属地位；另一方面则是争夺原料、市场和势力范围的剧烈竞争。社会主义世界体系各国的关系则是建立在一切大小国家的权利充分平等和它们之间的互助合作的基础之上。
    社会主义国家之间的关系的新的特点，同这些国家的经济和社会制度的本质有着不可分割的联系。政治上的团结，当前目标和建设共产主义社会的最终目标的一致，决定着它们实行经济和政治合作的可能性与必要性，这种合作将有助于克服它们在社会与经济发展道路上所遇到的障碍。
    现在社会主义国家之间已经建立了各种形式的经济上的联系。
    从前在资本主义制度之下，罗马尼亚纯粹是一个对中欧与西欧国家的农业原料供应者，和工业制成品（包括生产资料和消费资料）的输入者。保加利亚的经济也同样是如此的。
    现在，由于这些国家的工业的发展，除了几种原有的传统联系外，还出现了一些新的形式。例如罗马尼亚今天在以石油装备供应给捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、波兰和中国等国家。
    在第一个五年计划期间，经济互助委员会与会各国的经济合作主要是通过贸易的形式来进行的。而实践表明，这种形式已经不够了，需要利用新的和更丰富的形式，以便在各国的经济发展过程中实行更密切的联系。
    对外贸易协定是具有一定的限制性的，它既不容许在各个经济部门的基本建设计划中实行配合，也不可能使各国在生产方面实行专业化和协作化。换句话说，对外贸易协定对于社会主义各国经济的按比例发展的要求来说，是一种不够充分的合作形式。
    社会主义国际劳动分工的有计划的发展，使每一个国家能够通过这样一些形式来尽可能合理地发展本国的经济：适当地利用自己的原料资源，发展那些本身拥有有利的经济条件的加工工业，而不去发展其他那些经济前提不充分的工业部门。
    经济互助委员会柏林会议的公报中已经指出，在今后的五年计划期间，拥有最大的煤田和最有利的开采条件的波兰，将要把它的煤矿工业扩充到相当大的规模，以便供应燃料和炼焦煤给社会主义阵营的其他国家。这将使它的一些邻国能够腾出相当一部分资源力量来，因为这些力量假如也用来发展采煤工业的话，是不合算的。
    大家知道，欧洲人民民主国家的某些铁矿床是贫铁矿，开采这种铁矿和用它们来炼铁在经济上是不很有利的。而另一方面，苏联却拥有质地优良的大量铁矿。会议公报指出，苏联将发展它的铁矿开采量，以便满足人民民主国家对于铁矿的日益增长的需要。
    同样地，会议对于向与会各国的国民经济供应电力的问题也予以充分的注意。在各国专家的参加之下，已经拟订了一个准备把电力网联结起来的工作计划，以便交流电力和促进在电力工业方面的按地区分工。
    在国际规模上的社会主义劳动分工，也要求通过一切有效的经济形式来实行生产的专业化。社会主义经济体系中的专业化并不仅仅是专门着重发展某些工业部门，而是在各个有关部门中专门生产某些重大的机械工业产品的部件。在柏林会议上，有关各国已通过了关于生产水平和互相供应基本类型的机器设备的建议。此外还采取措施来扩大各国之间在机械和光学仪器方面的专业化，和保证技术的进一步发展。
    生产专业化的有计划实行，将使各国能够减少相同类型的产品的生产。并减少每一个国家所生产的机器设备的类型。例如，罗马尼亚原来生产的十四种类型的机器将减少为六种。实行这种专业化以后，就能够增加生产新的品种，改进现有的品种并降低它们的成本。
    由于罗马尼亚石油工业已有了高度的发展，它的生产量和生产经验已经有了增长，因此已决定在第二个五年计划期间专门发展它的现代化的深井钻探设备。今年我们就要把许多这方面的设备供应给中华人民共和国。同时，罗马尼亚在今后的年份中将继续扩展它的石油工业，以便满足其他社会主义国家的需要。
    由于同样丰富的资源条件，在今后五年中罗马尼亚也将大大地扩展它的化学工业，增加合成橡胶、纤维素、氮肥、苏打产品、塑料织物和合成织物的产品，其中一部分将用来供应那些缺少必要的原料来发展这些部门生产的兄弟国家的需要。
    很显然地，这种国际劳动分工和生产专业化不可能建立在贸易协定的基础之上，而只能建立在经济互助委员会与会各国长期国民经济计划的相互配合的基础上。
    经济发展计划的相互配合有助于最合理地利用现有的生产能力，避免重复建立新的工业企业，而可以利用其他与会国家相应的生产能力来满足自己的需要。其结果将使每一个国家的投资得到更加合理有效的利用。
    此外，长期计划的相互配合将有助于从事某些建设工程的进行（例如共同开发利用多瑙河的水利资源）。这种工程如果要由个别的国家来完成是不可能的，因为它们需要极大量的投资，而且牵涉到许多国家。
    长期计划的相互配合还能够促进各国之间的科学和技术合作。经济互助委员会柏林会议也已采取措施来改进经济与科学技术合作的组织工作，建立新的组织形式，以便使与会各国的有关部门相互进行直接的、经常的和有效的联系。
    这种联系将加速和增加生产领域中的经验交流，有助于各国最新的科学技术成就的介绍和推广。此外，还可以节省相当大的技术力量，使每一个国家的科学家和技术人员的创造力量得到更加有效的利用，并且避免在科学技术研究工作上的重复现象和扩大研究工作的范围。可以预料，柏林会议决议的实行将会大大地促进各个社会主义国家的技术发展。
    社会主义国际劳动分工和长期计划的相互配合并不表示社会主义经济体系的孤立发展。与此相反，社会主义国家希望并准备继续发展同所有经济和政治制度不同的国家的贸易关系和经济合作。
    在过去五年内，我国同资本主义国家的贸易量已经增加了近两倍半。我们希望在没有任何歧视的平等互利的基础上发展这种贸易。但是，发展同一切国家的贸易并不只是取决于我们这一方面，它同样也决定于另一方面。
    应该指出，社会主义国家同亚非国家之间的贸易的迅速发展在这方面是有意义的和可喜的。
    我们竭力主张同资本主义国家发展贸易，那倒决不是因为这种贸易是社会主义国家发展的必不可少的条件。事实证明，即使在西方国家实行贸易歧视和封锁的情况下，社会主义国家仍然能够在社会主义体系内部顺利地组织它们所需要的一切生产。
    无论如何，我们深信，历史的现实将会迫使现在仍然保持顽固不化的资本主义国家某些集团采取和平共处和经济竞赛的道路。
    社会主义阵营各国之间的紧密合作和兄弟互助，是现代世界上的一件重要事情。它为这些国家的生产力的发展，为进一步改善人民的物质和文化生活打开了宏伟的远景。（本报特约稿）
