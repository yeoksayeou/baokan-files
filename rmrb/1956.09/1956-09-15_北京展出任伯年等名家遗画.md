Beijing Exhibits Ren Bonian and Other Famous Artists' Paintings

(Our Dispatch) Works by the four great modern painters Ren Bonian, Wu Changshuo, Chen Shizeng, and Huang Binhong are on display at the Beijing Art Exhibition Hall starting from the 15th.

This exhibition is organized by the Chinese Artists Association to inherit and promote the national tradition of Chinese painting, and to meet the learning needs of modern artists and young art workers. Chinese painting declined during the Ming and Qing dynasties. At that time, painters pursued the works of their predecessors, taking "scrolls" as teachers and advocating imitation. Ren, Wu, Chen, and Huang, however, were outstanding painters who persisted in and promoted the realist tradition of Chinese painting during the most rampant period of formalism in the late Qing dynasty. Ren Bonian was the most famous professional painter since the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras. He was meticulous and conscientious in his artistic creations. His skills and talent were recognized by his contemporaries. He was proficient in landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, insects, and fish, as well as meticulous and freehand brushwork. His portrait paintings not only inherited the traditional techniques of capturing the spirit but also absorbed the chiaroscuro method introduced from Europe at that time. His depiction, capturing of the spirit, and vividness of the image are truly breathtaking. Wu Changshuo, like his teacher and friend Ren Bonian, benefited from calligraphy in his painting style. He especially excelled in flower paintings. The peonies, daffodils, grapes, wisteria, bamboo, autumn chrysanthemums, reeds, etc., exhibited at the exhibition are all full of vitality. In his later years, he mainly painted pine, cypress, plum, and bamboo, using powerful brushstrokes that penetrated the paper. Chen Shizeng's works often have new artistic conceptions in their composition. His freehand sketches are realistic and vivid, and were unanimously praised by modern painters during the preview on the 14th. Huang Binhong was also a master of realism in modern times. His painting style had the charm of the Six Dynasties. He learned from the past without being bound by it. He advocated taking real mountains and rivers as teachers. He loved to travel to famous mountains and rivers throughout his life. He started painting at the age of ten, and still insisted on traveling and sketching after the age of seventy. His landscape paintings formed a unique style.

    北京展出任伯年等名家遗画
    本报讯近代四大画家任伯年、吴昌硕、陈师曾、黄宾虹的作品，15日起在北京美术展览馆展出。
    这次展览会，是中国美术家协会为了继承和发扬中国绘画的民族传统，以及应现代美术家和青年美术工作者学习的需要而举办的。中国的绘画，到了明、清两代，日趋衰落。当时画家们追求的是前人的作品，所谓以“卷轴”为师，崇尚临摹。而任、吴、陈、黄等人，便是在清末形式主义最嚣张的时代，坚持了并且发扬了我国绘画的现实主义传统的杰出画家。任伯年是乾嘉以来最负盛名的职业画家。生平创作态度认真不苟。他的技艺、画才为时人所公认。山水、人物、花鸟、虫鱼，工笔画、写意画，无所不能，无所不精。他的肖像画，不仅继承了传统的传神技法，而且还吸取了当时欧洲传入的晕染法，写貌、传神和形象的生动，叹为观止。吴昌硕同他的师友任伯年一样，画风得力于书法。他尤其擅长花卉。展览会上展出的牡丹、水仙、葡萄、紫藤、墨竹、秋菊、芦花……无不生意盎然。晚年作品多松、柏、梅、竹，用笔雄健，力透纸背。陈师曾的作品，章法布局常有新的意境。他的写意小品，真实生动，14日预展时，得到现代画家同声一致的赞赏。黄宾虹也是近代的一位写实主义大师。作画笔调有六朝韵味，他学古而不泥古。他主张以真山真水为师，生平好游名山大川，十岁开始作画，七十以后仍坚持旅行写生。他的山水画自成一家。
