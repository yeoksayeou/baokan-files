Comrade Zhao Shuli's Speech

The New Demands of the Masses on Writers – the Unity of "Popularization" and "Elevation" – Attention to Studying the Existing Foundation of the Masses in Literature and Art

I fully agree with the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping.

I would now like to express some opinions on the popularization of literature and art.

With the improvement of economic life, the masses have also put forward new requirements for cultural and recreational activities—demanding more, higher quality, and more suitable to their tastes. Although our literary and artistic circles cannot, like the economic departments, classify and set production figures for the Second Five-Year Plan, we must also make our progress worthy of note in this national march towards socialism. Therefore, meeting the needs of the broad masses is still something we should study.

Enriching the cultural and recreational life of the masses, like increasing production economically, must be based on the existing foundation—I believe that what Chairman Mao said about seeking improvement on the basis of popularization also contains this meaning.

I think that recently some people have had some biases in their understanding of "popularization"—confusing the meaning of "popularization" and "vulgarization."

"Vulgarization" is a condition for popularization, but it only takes into account the masses' language habits and knowledge range (such as some academic concepts) and not the entire literary and artistic foundation of the masses. A illiterate person naturally has great limitations in understanding profound things, but being illiterate does not necessarily mean being ignorant of "reason" or "matters," and therefore not necessarily being ignorant of "art." A person who has lived for decades rarely eats for nothing. Everyone's scope of contact with things varies in breadth, and the degree of understanding varies in depth, but each has a multifaceted life, and each has a concentrated area of focus. Literature and art, in their lives, often become a constituent part to varying degrees, and some are even proficient in certain folk arts. The natural forms of literary and artistic sources that we rely on as inexhaustible are right here. It is a pity that some of us only pay attention to this when absorbing nutrients for ourselves, but when directly serving the masses, we put this aside, harming our cause and failing to establish closer ties with the broad masses. For example, some comrades who work in cultural centers and stations only pay attention to coordinating with the current central work and the easy-to-understand text when selecting works for the masses; and the writers who accept their orders often write something that they themselves do not consider art to answer their requests—both sides think that the masses only need these to be entertained. If they pay more attention to what books the masses usually like to listen to, what dramas they like to watch, and what changes have taken place in their mental state after they have become accustomed to appreciating those things, they would not force things that are neither artistic nor good at publicizing politics into the eyes of the masses.

Any writer who is interested in a certain part of the socialist cause and is willing to write, no matter what style or genre they use, is beneficial—it will always suit some people's reading—but it seems to be our responsibility that the broad masses lack suitable literary and artistic nourishment. Some people divide the boundaries between popularization and improvement too clearly, but they only want to be promoters of improvement, which I think is not a good phenomenon. Writers should bear a considerable responsibility for the lack of more and better literary and artistic nourishment for the broad masses—we have been too little responsible in providing this. I think that as long as we have a sense of responsibility to the broad masses, as long as we do not underestimate the literary and artistic foundation of the masses, there is a great unity between popularization and improvement in creation—for example, the play "Before the New Director Arrives," which has already been welcomed by the masses, is popular, can it not be considered high-level? The reason why this work can be popularized is that its people, events, words, and interests do not seem unfamiliar to the masses; the reason why it is high-level is that its political and artistic qualities have reached the required intensity. The masses need more such works. We have a responsibility to meet their needs.

Does my hope conflict with the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom"? I don't think it conflicts. What the masses need is also a hundred flowers, and works with a larger mass appeal should not be counted as just one flower. "Dong Xi Xiang," "Water Margin," "The White-Haired Girl," and "Before the New Director Arrives" are all popular, all high-level, and all form their own flower, and no one has imitated anyone. However, I think that when a hundred flowers are blooming, everyone should ask themselves to release flowers that are more loved by more people, and therefore hope that everyone will pay more attention to studying the existing foundation of the broad masses in literature and art, so as to cultivate their own flowers to be more loved by them.

### 供应群众更多、更好的文艺作品

    供应群众更多、更好的文艺作品
    作家　赵树理同志的发言
    群众对作家提出的新要求——“普及”和“提高”的统一性——注意研究群众在文学艺术方面的现有基础
    我完全同意刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、邓小平同志的报告。
    我现在就文艺的普及工作发表一点意见。
    随着经济生活的提高，群众对文娱活动也提出了新的要求——要求更多、更高、更合于自己胃口的东西。我们文艺界虽然不能像经济部门那样分门别类定出第二个五年计划的生产数字，但是也得在这全国人民向着社会主义迈进的途中，把自己的步伐走得像个样子，因此满足广大群众的需要仍是我们应该研究的事。
    丰富群众的文娱生活，也和经济上的增产一样，要根据现有的基础——我以为毛主席所说的在普及基础上求提高也包涵这个意思。
    我以为近来还有些人对“普及”的理解有些偏向——把“普及”和“通俗”的意义混为一谈。
    “通俗”是普及的一个条件，但那只是照顾到群众的语言习惯和知识范围（如学术上一些概念）而不是照顾到群众文学艺术基础的全部。一个文盲，在理解高深的事物方面固然有很大的限制，但文盲不一定是“理”盲、“事”盲，因而也不一定是“艺”盲。一个人长到几十岁，很少是白吃饭的。每个人对事物接触的范围有广狭，理解的程度有深浅，但各有其多方面的生活，也各有其集中精力的方面，而文学艺术在他们的生活中，往往或多或少已经成为构成部分，有的甚至精通了某种民间艺术。我们恃为取之不尽用之不竭的自然形态的文学艺术源泉，正在这里。可惜我们有些人在为自己吸取养料的时候才注意到这个，而在直接为群众服务的时候又把这个丢在一边，害得我们的事业未能和广大的群众更紧密地发生连系。例如有些作文化馆、站工作的同志们，为群众选作品的时候，只注意配合当前的中心工作和文字的通俗易懂；而接受了他们的订货单的写作者，也往往写一点连自己也不认为是艺术的小东西来回答他们的要求——双方都以为群众只要有了这些就足以娱乐了，要是多注意一下群众平常爱听什么书、爱看什么戏、领略惯了那些东西之后其精神状态有过些什么变化，就不至于把既不艺术，又宣传不好政治的东西强往群众眼睛里塞了。
    任何一个作家，只要对社会主义事业某一部分感到兴趣，愿意写，不论用什么体裁、什么风格写出来都是有益的——总合乎某一部分人读——但广大的群众缺乏合适的文学艺术食粮，似乎也是我们的责任。有些人把普及和提高的界限分得太清楚，但又都只愿当提高工作者，我以为是不太妙的现象。广大群众没有更多、更好的文学艺术食粮，作家应该负相当大的责任——我们在这方面的负责任的供应太少了。我以为只要我们对广大群众有责任感，只要不轻视群众文学艺术的基础，在创作方面，普及与提高是有很大的统一性的——例如已经为群众所欢迎的话剧“新局长到来之前”是普及的了，难道不能算高级的吗？这个作品，其所以能普及，是因为其人、其事、其言、其趣，在群众看来都不生疏；其所以是高级的，是因为它的政治性、艺术性都达到应有的强度。群众需要更多的这样的作品。我们有责任满足他们的需要。
    我这个希望是否和“百花齐放”的方针冲突呢？我以为不冲突。群众需要的也是百花，不应把群众性大一点的作品只算作一花。“董西厢”、“水浒传”、“白毛女”、“新局长到来之前”都是普及的，都是高级的，又都各成一花，谁也没有仿模谁。不过我以为在百花齐放的时候，各人应该要求自己要放之花更为多人所爱，因而也希望大家多多注意研究广大群众在文学艺术方面现有的基础，以便把自己之花培植得更为他们所爱。
