Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 7th: The Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation's No. 2 Mining Construction Company, since implementing a mass engineering quality self-inspection system, has gradually transformed from a unit with many quality accidents to one guaranteeing the best engineering quality. From April to August this year, the company has not had any major quality accidents affecting the lifespan of projects, except for one quality accident still under investigation.

The quality self-inspection system was established by the company based on the principle of "whoever constructs is responsible for the engineering quality." It begins with the grassroots construction personnel (including workers, group leaders, and foremen) inspecting the engineering quality at each level. Only after they deem it qualified are the quality supervision personnel allowed to inspect and accept it. This transforms the past situation of relying solely on a few quality supervisors to inspect engineering quality into an inspection by all participating construction workers, greatly inspiring the workers' enthusiasm for consciously guaranteeing engineering quality. The proportion of projects passing the engineering company's own inspection on the first try has gradually increased from 80% in May to over 90% in August.

To ensure engineering quality, technicians and workers can not only strictly follow operating procedures for construction but also inspect as they go, immediately correcting any errors discovered. Technician Lang Shuoyan discovered that the anchor bolts did not meet quality standards and, after several consultations, finally persuaded the manufacturer to rework all the anchor bolts.

The engineering company has taken many effective measures to ensure the smooth implementation of the mass quality self-inspection system. Construction leaders brief workers and construction group leaders every week on issues that should be paid attention to during construction. Experience exchange meetings on guaranteeing engineering quality are held at regular intervals to organize advanced quality producers to introduce their experiences and encourage those who have had quality accidents to share their lessons. Advanced quality producers appearing at various construction sites are also rewarded in a timely manner.

    鞍山第二矿山建筑工程公司通过群众检查
    扭转了工程质量低劣的局面
    据新华社鞍山7日电　鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司第二矿山建筑工程公司，自从实行群众性的工程质量自检制度以来，已经从原来是质量事故较多的单位逐步转变为保证工程质量最好的单位。从今年4月到8月止，这个公司除了发生过一次还需要查明原因的质量事故以外，没有发生过影响工程寿命的重大质量事故。
    质量自检制度，是这个公司根据“谁施工，谁对工程质量负责”的原则建立的。它首先由施工的基层人员（包括工人、小组长、工长）逐级来检查工程质量，认为合格以后，再让质量监督人员检查和验收。这样，就把过去单纯依靠少数质量监督人员检查工程质量的情况，变成由所有参加施工的职工来检查，大大启发了职工自觉地保证工程质量的积极性。这个工程公司经过职工自己检查一次就合格的工程，已经由5月份的80％逐步提高到8月份的90％以上。
    为了保证工程质量，技术人员和工人们不但都能严格地按照操作规程施工，而且还能随做随检查，一发现错误就立刻纠正。技术员郎硕彦发现地脚螺丝做的不合乎质量标准，经过数次交涉，终于使制造厂把这些地脚螺丝都重新加了工。
    这个工程公司采取许多有效措施，保证群众性质量自检制度的顺利实行。施工领导干部每周都向工人和施工小组长交代施工中应该注意的问题。每隔一定时期就举行一次保证工程质量的经验交流会议，组织保证质量的先进生产者介绍经验，并且动员发生过质量事故的人介绍工作教训。各工地出现的保证质量的先进生产者，也都及时给予奖励。
