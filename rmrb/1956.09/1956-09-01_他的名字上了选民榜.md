    His Name is on the Voter List
    On August 9th, Li Lixiang, a teacher at the Xuanwu District Workers' Spare-time School, heard that the voter list was posted, and he rushed to see if his name was on it. When he saw the three words "Li Lixiang," he felt indescribably happy, and his eyes could not help but well up with tears. Because from that day on, he changed his landlord status and became a citizen with the right to vote and stand for election.
    Li Lixiang is thirty-nine years old this year. At the end of 1949, he fled from Wuqing County, Hebei Province, to Beijing because he was afraid of struggle. At that time, he thought that no one in Beijing would recognize him, and he could get by if he found some work to do. Unexpectedly, during the general election in 1954, everyone knew that he was a landlord class element and had not been engaged in labor for five years. After review by the voter qualification review team, he was deprived of his electoral rights. At that time, he was worried that the school would not want him. However, the director of the school's academic affairs office often helped him, telling him to work with peace of mind, get rid of exploitation ideas, and strive to change his landlord class status. When he had difficulties in life, the school also gave him welfare subsidies. He was very touched and settled down to work.
    During the summer vacation of 1954, the school system launched a sincere and honest study campaign. Li Lixiang received a profound education and worked even harder. In order to teach the class well, he often used his rest time to prepare lessons and correct student homework, and also helped other teachers complete teaching tasks.
    Last year, after the nationwide suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign, Li Lixiang had a further understanding of his landlord class nature. He was also very angry at the crimes of the counter-revolutionaries. During this period, he actively reported bad people.
    On July 15th of this year, at the beginning of this election, the comrades of the general election team notified Li Lixiang to attend a meeting. At the meeting, the leader of the election team said to everyone, "This is a great joy for you. As long as you give up exploitation, engage in labor for five years, and recognize your own exploitation sins, you can apply to change your status. It will be approved by the district people's committee after discussion and agreement by the masses." Li Lixiang didn't sleep all night, thinking over and over about the words of the team leader, and thanking the government for giving him the opportunity to be a new person. The next morning, he wrote the application and sent it.
    Everything went smoothly, and Li Lixiang's name appeared on the voter list.

    他的名字上了选民榜
    8月9日这天，宣武区职工业余学校教员李立祥听说选民榜贴出来了，连忙跑去看有没有自己的名字。当他看到“李立祥”三个字的时候，心里有说不出来的高兴，不由得眼睛也湿润了。因为从今天起，他改变了地主成份，成为一个有选举权和被选举权的公民了。
    李立祥今年三十九岁，1949年底他因为害怕斗争，从河北省武清县跑到北京。当时，他以为跑到北京没人认识自己，找一点事作就可以混过去了。不料，在1954年普选的时候，大家知道他是地主阶级分子，并且从事劳动又不到五年，经过选民资格审查组的审查，剥夺了他的选举权利。当时，他担心学校不要他。可是学校的教务处主任却经常帮助他，叫他安心工作，去掉剥削思想，争取改变地主阶级成份。他生活上有困难，学校还给他福利补助。他很受感动，工作就安下心来。
    1954年暑假，学校系统开展了忠诚老实学习，李立祥受到了深刻教育，在工作中也更加努力了。为了把课教好，他经常利用休息时间备课和批改学生作业，并且还帮助其他教员完成教学任务。
    去年，全国开展肃反斗争以后，李立祥对自己的地主阶级本质，更有了进一步的认识；对反革命分子的罪行也非常愤恨，在这期间，他积极检举了坏人。
    今年7月15日，在这次选举开始的时候，普选工作组的同志通知，李立祥去开会，会上，选举工作组的组长向大家说，这是你们的一件大喜事，只要放弃剥削，从事劳动五年，认识自己的剥削罪恶，自己可以申请改变成份，经过群众讨论同意，区人民委员会批准就行。李立祥这一夜都没睡着，翻来复去的想着工作组组长的话，感谢政府给自己从新作人的机会。第二天一早他就把申请书写好送去了。
    一切都很顺利，于是，李立祥的名字出现在选民榜上了。
