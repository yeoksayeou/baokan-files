Comrade Xie Fuzhi, First Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, speaks:

    I fully agree with the political report made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the Party Central Committee to the大会 [da hui – conference, congress], and I agree with the other documents and reports submitted by the Party Central Committee to the conference for discussion.

    Since the Seventh National Congress of the Party, the people of all nationalities in Yunnan Province, like the people of the whole country, have experienced great changes in the history of our country. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, relying on the people of all nationalities, we completed the remaining tasks of the New Democratic Revolution and achieved a decisive victory in the Socialist Revolution. At present, the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in the province has been basically completed; industrial and agricultural production have completed or exceeded the tasks of the first three years of the First Five-Year Plan; the total output value of agricultural production has increased by 34.35 percent compared with 1952, and the total output value of industrial production has increased by 219.43 percent compared with 1952, and other undertakings have also developed correspondingly. This has laid a preliminary foundation for promoting socialist construction and gradually changing the backwardness of the border areas of the motherland.

    Since Yunnan Province is a multi-ethnic area, the implementation of almost any policy is inseparable from the characteristic of "nationality." Therefore, I would like to express some opinions only on the issue of ethnic work in the province:

    More than 60 Ethnic Sub-Groups Account for One-Third of the Province's Population

    The ethnic situation in Yunnan is very complex. After preliminary identification, there are 20 ethnic units, including more than 60 ethnic sub-groups; the minority ethnic population is nearly six million, accounting for one-third of the province's total population; and their distribution area accounts for 70 percent of the province's total area. No county or city in the province is a single ethnic group. Eighty percent of the townships are inhabited by various ethnic groups or are concentrated in minority ethnic groups. Nearly 1.9 million border minority ethnic groups live adjacent to people of the same ethnicity abroad on a 4,000-kilometer border, and the internal and external relations are extremely complex. The social and economic development of the various ethnic groups is very unbalanced. Before liberation, except for the ethnic groups in the central area who had already entered feudal society, about 2.4 million people in 27 counties on the other fringes were still in the form of feudal landlord economy, slave society, or even remnants of primitive tribes. Therefore, some people say: "Yunnan is a living history of social development."

    In the long historical process, the relationship between the various ethnic groups has formed two basic characteristics: on the one hand, due to the cruel ethnic oppression and the ethnic differentiation policy of "using barbarians to control barbarians" implemented by the ruling groups of the Han and other ethnic groups in the past dynasties, there is a deep gap between the various ethnic groups, especially between the minority ethnic groups and the Han; however, for generations, the people of all ethnic groups have also had and developed economic and cultural interdependence, and in the struggle against imperialist aggression and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, a common political destiny has been formed.

    After the Chinese working class led the state power, the minority ethnic groups in Yunnan got rid of the state of being oppressed and discriminated against in history and joined the unified and indivisible family of the motherland. The ethnic killings and armed fights between the various ethnic groups have stopped, the class relations within the ethnic groups have also changed, and the production and living standards of the various ethnic groups have improved, and the purchasing power of the working people has generally increased by more than 80 percent. However, ethnic segregation and the de facto inequality between ethnic groups cannot be completely eliminated at once. Therefore, how to correctly solve the ethnic problem, continuously increase the unity between ethnic groups, and lead the people of all ethnic groups to gradually transition to socialism has become a very important task in our work.

    The Forms and Speed of Democratic Reform Vary from Nationality to Nationality

    Embarking on socialism is the common aspiration and inevitable trend of the people of all nationalities, but the way they go is not exactly the same. In the various forms of democracy and the speed of transformation, each nationality has its own characteristics.

    For nationalities that have entered class society, the essence of the nationality problem is the class problem. Gradually transitioning to socialism through democratic reform is an insurmountable stage. However, since the nationality problem is often intertwined with the class problem, to solve the class problem within the nationality, we must rely on the consciousness of the people of all nationalities, and we must consider the different policies and methods of democratic reform based on different characteristics.

    The democratic reforms in the ethnic areas of Yunnan basically adopted two methods. In the inland areas, since the situation is basically the same as that in the Han areas, and most of the landlords are Han, the land reform basically adopted the same land reform as in the Han areas. Only in some specific policies and methods of the reform, different measures were adopted according to different characteristics. Generally speaking, it is more moderate than in the Han areas. For example, for the high-altitude and cold mountainous areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups, the "Land Reform Method for Mountainous Areas" (which is broader than the general land reform areas) was stipulated; for the areas between the inland and the border areas, the "Buffer Zone Land Reform Method" was adopted, stipulating that only the land of the landlords was confiscated and distributed, and the struggle method was also relatively moderate). As for the border areas, because the ethnic segregation is relatively deep, each ethnic group has its own political and economic system, and the border is connected to the national border, every measure of the reform has a profound impact on all aspects. Therefore, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, we adopted the method of peaceful consultation for land reform. That is, the Party relies on the peasant masses, unites the upper-level leaders of the nationalities, and uses peaceful consultation to achieve the goal of eliminating the feudal exploitation system. It is this relatively mild reform that requires complex and difficult preparatory work. The main thing is to dredge up ethnic relations, unite the upper-level, contact the masses through the upper-level, and in turn rely on the awareness of the masses to influence and promote the upper-level. Through doing good deeds, making friends, training ethnic cadres, and promoting regional autonomy, the Party's prestige has been increasing day by day, and the new forces in the ethnic groups have gradually grown. Under the general trend, the upper-level people expressed their willingness to accept the reform, which made the land reform in the border areas a matter of course.

    No matter what method is adopted, land reform itself is a revolution, a fierce class struggle. Therefore, to carry out reform, we must rely on the masses and mobilize the masses, otherwise this revolution cannot be realized. Some of our comrades once attempted to rely solely on government decrees and complete the reform task by means of grace, and the result could only be lifeless formalism.

    Since it is a peaceful consultation, the upper-level united front work is particularly important. In the consultation on reform, we made political arrangements and took care of the lives of the upper-level ethnic groups, so that they felt from their own experience that agreeing to the reform was the best way out. This is not only conducive to getting them to give up exploitation and privileges, but also conducive to prompting them to move closer to the Party and the people. Some of our comrades once could not figure out this approach and wanted to take a simple approach, which was obviously wrong.

    The peaceful consultation on land reform in our province has been successfully completed in the population of 900,000, and the area with a population of 700,000 is about to be completed. Facts have proved that this approach is successful, eliminating the feudal exploitation system, liberating agricultural productive forces, the peasants have obtained land, and the upper-level have all achieved their goals. This has further consolidated the unity of the nationalities and cleared the way for us to jointly carry out socialist construction.

    In carrying out land reform in ethnic areas, it is necessary to correctly handle the relationship between class contradictions and ethnic contradictions. Only seeing the class problem, mechanically transplanting the set of reform methods in the inland areas, and ignoring the ethnic characteristics and the ethnic segregation in history, will lead to the "left" tendency of being impatient and rash, and even make the class contradictions within the ethnic group covered up and develop into ethnic disputes. Conversely, only emphasizing ethnic characteristics, blindly accommodating the upper-level ethnic groups, and ignoring the class essence of ethnic issues and the reasonable demands of the people will lead to a right-wing tendency of being passive and conservative, and the result will not fundamentally solve the ethnic problem. We have experienced these "left" and right tendencies in our actual work in the past few years, and only under the constant guidance of the central government have we made progress in ethnic work by correcting mistakes.

    Comprehensive Assistance Must Be Provided to Catch Up with the Advanced Level of the Whole Country

    Once land reform is completed, agricultural socialist transformation should be steadily implemented in all ethnic areas. It would be wrong not to reverse the spontaneous trend of capitalism that occurred after land reform, and not to quickly guide them towards socialism. Without the foundation of agricultural cooperativization, it is impossible to help the development of the various minority ethnic groups more effectively. However, their production and living standards are still very low. Some still maintain the farming method of "slash-and-burn cultivation." Some do not have their own written language. Generally, there is no industry and working class, and even no independent handicraft industry. In this situation, without the vigorous help of the Han nationality, it cannot be significantly changed in a short period of time, and it will often develop from the contradiction between the advanced and the backward to complex mass ethnic issues. In the first half of this year, some Miao and Yao areas in our province that had been cooperativized had problems such as withdrawing from the cooperatives. Therefore, at the same time as implementing agricultural cooperativization, comprehensive assistance must be given to the economic and cultural development of the various ethnic groups, so that they can catch up with the domestic advanced level within a certain period of time. We deeply realize that the continuous improvement of the production and living standards of the various ethnic groups is the material basis for consolidating ethnic unity.

    On the issue of cooperativization, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, we fully estimated the favorable conditions and unique difficulties of the ethnic areas, and successively launched mutual aid and cooperation movements in the inland and border ethnic areas. In our work, we have generally implemented the following principles: cultivating ethnic cadres, the advanced helping the backward, the majority taking care of the minority, respecting ethnic customs and religious beliefs, and vigorous assistance from the people's government. After several years of efforts, the cooperativization of the inland ethnic areas has basically been completed together with the Han people; in the border areas where land reform has been carried out through peaceful consultation, some pilot projects have also been carried out by combining the mobilization of the masses and strengthening the united front work at the upper-level. According to statistics, the number of farmers who have joined cooperatives in these areas accounts for 10 percent of the total number of farmers, and the vast majority of the cooperatives that have been established have significantly increased production.

    Border Minority Ethnic Areas Are Prepared to Adopt a Direct Transition Method

    As for some other minority ethnic areas on the border, we are prepared to adopt a direct transition method: there are about 700,000 people in this type of ethnic area in our province, and their society and economy are even more backward. Taking the Jingpo ethnic group as an example, the land of all landlords and the surplus land of rich peasants will be distributed to the farmers, and each person will only be allocated the output of 80 jin of grain. The production level is that some seeds planted in the ground can only have a harvest of seven or eight times, and there are also accumulated habits of killing animals to worship ghosts, which greatly damage production. Although internal class differentiation has begun, the prince and mountain official system is still a factor hindering social development, but the most prominent problem there is not class contradiction. After several years of exploration, we believe that in this type of area, land reform should no longer be carried out as a revolutionary movement. We should unite all working people, unite and transform all public leaders who have contact with the masses, and directly transition to socialism through the road of mutual aid and cooperation with the strong help of the state. The specific approach is: first, make political arrangements for the big princes and mountain officials, and with their consent, help the working people set up cooperatives, supply production tools, help with food rations, and improve farming techniques to rapidly develop production. In the process of cooperativization, gradually abolish certain exploitation systems. According to the experience of four pilot projects in 1954, although the upper-level had concerns at the beginning, and the masses did not know how to evaluate work and record points, or how to manage production, after in-depth political work and improved production technology, the output of the cooperatives generally increased by one to two times, showing the superiority of being organized. One hundred and sixty-three new cooperatives were established this year, and it is expected that cooperativization can be basically completed in the next four to five years. Of course, no remaining form of primitive society is sufficient to become a direct basis for socialism. Therefore, cooperativization here is not easier, but more difficult, and requires a longer time.

    Learn the Specialties of Minority Nationalities and Summarize Their Own Experiences

    In implementing agricultural cooperativization in any ethnic area, it is necessary to give full play to the strengths of the ethnic group. This requires us to be good at learning their specialties, be good at summarizing their own experiences "from the masses, to the masses," gradually educate and improve them, and help them develop agricultural production, build local industries, develop handicrafts, and do a good job in commercial, cultural, educational, and health work under the conditions of their voluntary acceptance and personal action. Although we have done a lot of work in this area in the past, our understanding of mutual learning and mutual assistance is still insufficient. In the future, we should conduct in-depth understanding of the border situation, comprehensively plan, and strengthen leadership in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee, so as to change the face of the fraternal ethnic groups in the border areas within a certain period of time.

    It should be pointed out here that helping does not mean replacing and monopolizing. People of all ethnic groups must walk on their own feet. Therefore, it is very important to promote the positive factors within the ethnic group, do a good job in regional autonomy, and train ethnic cadres. Our province has now established four ethnic autonomous prefectures and seven ethnic autonomous counties, and has trained and promoted more than 17,000 ethnic cadres. Party building and League building work have been carried out in all areas where land reform has been completed. However, there are still many shortcomings in our work in this area. Whether from the content and form of the ethnic regional autonomous government, or from the quantity and quality of the ethnic cadres, it is not enough to meet the needs of the development of ethnic work. In the future, we must formulate a plan for training ethnic cadres, so that the number of ethnic cadres in various departments of the ethnic regional autonomous government will gradually reach a majority, and train them to be able to assume major tasks in the Party committees at all levels. We must educate Han cadres to respect their powers, trust them, and actively train and improve them. Only when there are a large number of communist cadres in their own ethnic group can they undertake the arduous task of uniting the people of all ethnic groups to build socialism.

    To achieve mutual learning between ethnic groups and realize selfless assistance to minority ethnic groups, we must overcome the Han chauvinism and subjectivist work style of some cadres. Some people emphasize the backwardness of minority ethnic groups, despise the working ability and role of ethnic cadres, and for them, they are accustomed to measuring them with the yardstick of general Han cadres, and do not think from the practical significance of being conducive to leading their own ethnic group forward, so that they dare not boldly promote some ethnic cadres who should be promoted, and dare not boldly use those who have already been promoted, and even do not respect the powers of some administrative responsible cadres, forming monopolies and arbitrary interference. This kind of thinking and style greatly hinders ethnic unity and the growth of new forces in minority ethnic groups. Many comrades are indeed working hard to help the various minority ethnic groups, but they have subjectivism, and this subjectivism is directly related to Han chauvinism. Some do not study the characteristics of the ethnic group, do not proceed from the specific situation, and only rely on "doing things with good intentions," imposing their own views and practices on others. Taking commercial work as an example, in the ethnic areas, they do not supply the clothing that the ethnic groups like, but transport some four-pocket uniforms to sell; they even follow the bad habits of Han merchants exploiting the minority ethnic groups, regardless of whether it is good for the development of the local ethnic groups. Other work such as culture, education, and health also have similar examples. This kind of subjectivism often fails to see the demands of the minority ethnic groups, fails to see the shortcomings in their own work, is often blindly complacent, overestimates the achievements of ethnic work, emphasizes unity, and ignores particularity, and the result is that it distorts the Party's ethnic policy and turns good things into bad things.

    In the past few years of ethnic work, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, certain achievements have been made, but there are many shortcomings and errors. We should bear the main responsibility for these. As I said earlier, in the stage of democratic reform, we have had the problem of one-sidedness; especially the lack of sufficient assessment of the new situation in areas where democratic reform has been completed, the lack of vigorous assistance to the various ethnic groups in developing the economy and culture, there are general problems in the work, and the measures taken are not specific enough; also, because we did not report the situation to the higher-level in a timely manner, some problems that could be solved were not solved in a timely manner. All these are related to our low level of Marxism-Leninism and insufficient research on our Party's ethnic policy and the specific situation in our province. In the future, we will work hard to study and conduct in-depth investigations and research on the situation of the various ethnic groups, so as to do a better job in ethnic work.

    根据民族特点分别引导少数民族走向社会主义
    中共云南省委员会第一书记　谢富治同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志代表党中央向大会所作的政治报告，同意党中央提交大会讨论的其他文件和报告。
    从党的第七次全国代表大会以来，云南省的各族人民，和全国人民一样，经历了我国历史上的伟大变革。解放以后，我们在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的领导下，依靠各族人民，完成了新民主主义革命的遗留任务，取得了社会主义革命的决定性的胜利。目前，全省对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，已经基本上完成；工农业生产都完成或超额完成了第一个五年计划前三年的任务；农业生产总值比一九五二年增加百分之三十四点三五，工业生产总值比一九五二年增加百分之二百一十九点四三，其他各项事业都有相应的发展。这就为推进社会主义建设事业，逐步改变祖国边疆的落后面貌，打下了初步基础。
    由于云南省是一个多民族的地区，差不多任何政策的执行都离不开“民族”这个特点，所以我仅就省内民族工作问题，发表一些意见：
    六十多个民族支系占全省人口三分之一
    云南的民族情况很复杂，经过初步鉴别，有二十个民族单位，包括六十多个民族支系；少数民族人口近六百万，占全省总人口的三分之一；而其分布地区则占全省总面积的百分之七十，全省没有一个县、市是单一民族，有百分之八十的乡为各民族杂居或少数民族聚居。边疆少数民族将近一百九十万，在长达四千公里的国境线上，与国外同族人民比邻而居，内外关系极为复杂。各民族的社会经济发展很不平衡，解放前，除中心地区各民族已经进入封建社会之外，其他边沿二十七个县约二百四十万人口，还分别处在封建领主经济、奴隶社会以至原始部落残余的形态。所以有人说：“云南是一部活的社会发展史”。
    各民族之间的关系，在长期历史过程中，形成了两个基本特点：一方面由于历代汉族和其他民族的统治集团，实行残酷的民族压迫和“以夷制夷”的民族分化政策，使各族之间，特别各少数民族与汉族之间存在着深刻的隔阂；但是世代以来，各民族人民之间，却也存在和发展着经济、文化的相互依存关系，在反对帝国主义侵略和国民党反动统治的斗争中，更形成了政治上的共同命运。
    中国工人阶级领导了国家政权以后，云南各少数民族，摆脱了历史上被压迫歧视的状态，参加了统一的不可分割的祖国大家庭。各民族间的仇杀械斗停止了，民族内部的阶级关系也发生了变化，各民族的生产与生活水平有了提高，劳动人民的购买力一般增加百分之八十以上。可是民族隔阂与民族间的事实上的不平等，不是一下子所能完全消除的。因此，如何正确地解决民族问题，不断增加民族间的团结，领导各民族人民逐步过渡到社会主义，便成为我们工作中十分重要的任务。
    民主改革的形式和速度各个民族都有特征
    走入社会主义，是各民族人民的共同愿望和必然趋势，但是他们走的方式并不完全一样，在民主的各种形式和改造的速度上，每一个民族都有自己的特征。
    已经进入阶级社会的民族，民族问题的本质是阶级问题，经过民主改革逐步过渡到社会主义，是一个不可超越的阶段。但由于民族问题常和阶级问题交织在一起，所以要解决民族内部的阶级问题，就必须依靠各民族人民的自觉，就必须根据不同特点考虑民主改革的不同政策和方式。
    云南各民族地区的民主改革，基本上采取了两种方式，在内地由于情况同汉族地区基本相同，地主多为汉族，故基本上采取了和汉族地区一样的土地改革，只是在改革的某些具体政策和办法上，根据不同特点采取了不同的措施，一般说来，比汉族地区要缓和些。例如对少数民族聚居的高寒山区，规定了“山区土地改革办法”（较宽于一般土地改革区）；对于介乎内地与边疆之间的地区，采取了“缓冲区土地改革办法”，规定只没收分配地主的土地，斗争方式也比较缓和）等。至于在边疆，因为民族隔阂比较深，各民族都有其自己的政治、经济制度，而且地接国境，改革的每一措施，都对各方面发生深远的影响。因此，我们根据党中央的指示，采取了和平协商土地改革的方式。那就是党依靠农民群众，团结民族上层领袖人物，用和平协商的方式，达到消灭封建剥削制度的目的。正是这种较温和的改革，需要进行复杂、困难的准备工作。主要是疏通民族关系，团结上层，透过上层去联系群众，反过来又依靠群众的觉悟去影响、推动上层。经过做好事，交朋友，培养民族干部，推行区域自治等工作，党的威信日益提高，民族中的新生力量逐渐成长。在大势所趋之下，上层人士对改革表示愿意接受，这就使边疆地区的土地改革，成为“水到渠成”之势。
    无论采取什么方式，土地改革本身毕竟是一个革命，是一场激烈的阶级斗争。因此，要进行改革，就必须依靠群众，发动群众，否则就不能实现这一个革命。我们有些同志曾经企图单纯依靠政府法令，用恩赐的办法完成改革任务，结果只能是毫无生气的形式主义。
    既然是和平协商，所以上层统一战线工作就特别重要。在协商改革中，我们对民族上层进行了政治上的安排，生活上的照顾，使他们从切身体验中感觉到：只有赞成改革才是最好的出路。这样不只有利于换取他们放弃剥削和特权，也有利于促使他们更加向党和人民靠拢。我们曾经有些同志对于这种做法想不通，想采取一种简单办法，那显然是错误的。
    我省和平协商土地改革工作，已在九十万人口中胜利完成，另有七十万人口的地区即将完成。事实证明这种做法是成功的，消灭了封建剥削制度，解放了农业生产力，农民获得土地，上层各得其所。这就进一步巩固了民族团结，扫清了我们共同进行社会主义建设的道路。
    在民族地区进行土地改革，必须正确处理阶级矛盾与民族矛盾的关系问题。只看见阶级问题，机械地搬运内地的一套改革办法，忽视民族特点和历史上的民族隔阂，就会产生“左”的急躁冒进倾向，甚至会使民族内部的阶级矛盾被掩盖起来，发展成为民族间的纠纷。相反，只强调民族特点，一味迁就民族上层，忽视民族问题的阶级本质和人民群众的合理要求，就会产生右的消极保守倾向，结果就不能从根本上解决民族问题。这种“左”的和右的倾向，我们在几年来的实际工作中都曾经发生过，只是在中央不断地指示下，才从纠正错误中，使民族工作前进了一步。
    必须予以全面帮助，使能赶上全国先进水平
    土地改革一旦完成，各民族地区都应该稳步地实行农业社会主义改造。如果不把土改以后发生的资本主义自发趋势加以扭转，不迅速引导他们走向社会主义是错误的。离开了农业合作化这个基础，要想更有效的帮助各少数民族的发展是不可能的。但是他们的生产和生活水平毕竟很低，有的还保持着“刀耕火种”的耕作方法，有的没有自己的文字，一般没有工业和工人阶级，甚至没有独立的手工业。这种状况，如果没有汉族的大力帮助，就不能在较短时期内得到显著改变，就往往会由先进和落后的矛盾发展成为复杂的带群众性的民族问题。今年上半年在我省合作化了的个别的苗族、瑶族地区，就曾发生了退社这类的问题。因此，与实行农业合作化的同时，对各民族经济与文化的发展，必须予以全面的帮助，使他们能在一定时期内赶上国内先进水平。我们深深体会到，各民族生产生活水平的不断提高，是巩固民族团结的物质基础。
    在合作化问题上，我们根据党中央的指示，充分估计了民族地区的有利条件及其特有的困难，先后在内地与边疆民族地区开展了互助合作运动。工作中，一般都执行了：培养民族干部，先进帮助落后，多数照顾少数，尊重民族风俗习惯和宗教信仰，人民政府大力帮助这几条原则。经过几年的努力，内地民族地区的合作化已和汉族人民一道，基本上完成；在边疆和平协商土地改革的地区，也采取发动群众和加强上层统一战线工作相结合的方式，进行了一些试点工作，据统计，这类地区参加合作社的农户，已占总农户的百分之十，办起来的合作社绝大多数都显著地增加了生产。
    边疆少数民族地区准备采取直接过渡方式
    至于边疆另外一些少数民族地区，我们准备采取直接过渡的方式：我省这类民族地区约有七十万人口，他们的社会、经济更为落后。以景颇族为例，即将所有地主的及富农多余的土地分给农民，每人也只分到八十斤粮食的产量。生产水平有的是一粒种子下地只能有七、八倍的收获，而且存在着杀牲祭鬼，大量破坏生产的积习。虽然内部开始有阶级分化，王子、山官制度还是障碍社会发展的因素，但是那里最突出的问题，却不是阶级矛盾。经过几年来的摸索，我们认为在这类地区，不必再把土地改革当作一个革命运动来进行，应该是团结一切劳动人民，团结和改造一切与群众有联系的公众领袖人物，在国家大力帮助下，通过互助合作的道路，直接过渡到社会主义。具体做法是：首先在政治上安排大的王子、山官，在取得他们同意的情况下，帮助劳动人民办合作社，供给生产工具、帮助口粮、提高耕作技术，使生产迅速发展，在合作化过程中，逐步取消某些剥削制度。据一九五四年四个试点的经验证明，这样做开始虽然遇到上层顾虑，群众不会评工记分，不会管理生产等困难，但经过深入的政治工作，改进了生产技术，合作社普遍增产一倍到两倍，显示了组织起来的优越性。今年又办了一百六十三个新社，预计在今后四、五年内，可以基本上完成合作化。当然任何原始社会的残存形式，都不足以成为社会主义的直接基础。因此这里的合作化，不是更容易，而是更困难，需要更长的时间。
    学习少数民族的特长，总结他们自己的经验
    在任何民族地区实行农业合作化，都必须发挥本民族的长处。这就要我们善于学习他们的特长，善于总结他们自己的经验“从群众中来，到群众中去”，逐步教育提高他们，并在他们自愿接受和亲自行动的条件下，帮助他们发展农业生产，建设地方工业，发展手工业，做好商业和文化教育卫生工作。过去我们在这方面虽然做了很多工作，但是对于相互学习，相互帮助的认识，还是不够的，今后应根据党中央的指示，对边疆情况进行深入了解，全面规划，加强领导，争取在一定时期内，改变边疆兄弟民族的面貌。
    这里应当指出，帮助绝不等于代替包办，各族人民走路必须用自己的脚。因此发扬民族内部的积极因素，做好区域自治，培养民族干部，是非常重要的。我省现在已经建立四个民族自治州，七个民族自治县，培养提拔了民族干部一万七千余人，在所有完成土地改革的地区，都进行了建党建团工作。但是这方面我们工作上的缺点还很多，无论从民族区域自治政权的内容与形式上，从民族干部的数量与质量上，都不足以适应民族工作发展的需要。今后必须制订培养民族干部的计划，使民族区域自治政权机关各部门中的民族干部在数量上逐步达到多数，并培养他们能够在各级党委中担负主要工作。必须教育汉族干部尊重他们的职权，信任他们，并积极地培养提高他们。只有本民族中有了大批的共产主义干部，才能担当起团结各民族人民建设社会主义的艰巨任务。
    要做到民族间相互学习，实现对少数民族的无私援助，必须克服某些干部中的大汉族主义思想和主观主义作风。有些人强调少数民族落后，蔑视民族干部的工作能力和作用，对于他们，习惯于拿一般汉族干部的尺子去衡量，不从有利于带领本民族前进的实际意义上去着想，以致对某些应该提拔的民族干部不敢大胆提拔，已经提拔起来的也不敢大胆使用，甚至不尊重某些行政负责干部的职权，形成包办代替，妄加干涉。这种思想和作风，大大妨害了民族团结和少数民族新生力量的成长。有不少同志的确是在辛辛苦苦地帮助各少数民族，但是他们有主观主义，而这种主观主义又是和大汉族主义有直接联系的。有的不研究民族的特点，不从具体情况出发，单凭“好心肠办事”，把自己的观点、作法强加于人。以商业工作为例，在民族地区不供应民族喜爱的服装，却运去一些四个口袋的制服去卖；甚至沿袭着汉族商人剥削少数民族的恶劣作风，不管对当地民族的发展有无好处。其他如文教卫生等工作，也有类似的事例。这种主观主义，往往看不到少数民族的要求，看不见本身工作中的缺点，经常盲目自满，过高地估计民族工作的成绩，强调统一性，忽视特殊性，结果是歪曲了党的民族政策，把好事办坏了。
    过去几年的民族工作，在党中央正确领导下，取得了一定成绩，但是缺点和错误是不少的，对于这些，我们应该负主要责任。前面已经说过，在民主改革阶段，我们曾有过片面性的毛病；特别是对民主改革完成地区新的情况估计不足，大力帮助各民族发展经济与文化做得不够，工作上存在着一般化的毛病，采取的措施不够具体；也由于我们对上级反映情况不及时，致使某些可以解决的问题没有及时得到解决。所有这些都是与我们的马列主义水平不高，对我党的民族政策和我省的具体情况研究不够有关的。今后我们将努力学习，深入调查研究各民族的情况，以便把民族工作做得更好。
