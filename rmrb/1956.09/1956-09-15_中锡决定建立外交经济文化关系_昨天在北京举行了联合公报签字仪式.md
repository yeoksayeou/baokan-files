Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: A joint communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations between China and Ceylon was issued by Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, and Claude Corea, head of the Ceylon government delegation. The signing ceremony of the joint communiqué was held in Beijing this afternoon.

The Chinese side participating in the signing ceremony included: Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China; Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade; Lei Renmin, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade; Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture; Xia Yan, Vice Minister of Culture; Chen Shuliang, Deputy Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Bi Shuowang, Commissioner.

The Ceylon side participating in the signing ceremony included: Lawson T. de Fonseka; T.B. Subasinghe, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Defence and External Affairs, Member of Parliament; and L. Coomaraswamy, Senior Assistant Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.

After the signing ceremony, Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu delivered a speech, saying that both China and Ceylon had suffered from long-term colonialism, and now both countries are working to safeguard their national independence and develop their respective national economies. When the two countries are engaged in this arduous work, mutual support and cooperation are extremely necessary. In this regard, the Asian-African Conference has provided us with good guidelines. The Chinese government will, as always, adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit to develop friendly cooperation between China and Ceylon. He said that as friends of Ceylon, we are pleased to see the achievements Ceylon has recently made in various fields. As one of the Colombo countries, Ceylon participated in initiating the Asian-African Conference and made valuable contributions to promoting peace in Asia and Africa and the unity of Asian and African countries. We wish Ceylon to play a greater role in future international affairs. We believe that the further friendly cooperation between China and Ceylon will also inevitably contribute to the unity of Asian and African countries and to peace in the Asian-African region and the world.

Claude Corea, head of the Ceylon government delegation, delivered a speech, thanking the Chinese delegation for the spirit of understanding, sympathy, and cooperation shown during the talks. He wished China growing strength and that China would make greater contributions to the common ideals of China and Ceylon—peaceful coexistence, world peace, and strengthening friendship between the peoples of all countries.

Afterwards, both sides raised their glasses to jointly wish for the development of friendly relations between China and Ceylon. (Photo attached)
