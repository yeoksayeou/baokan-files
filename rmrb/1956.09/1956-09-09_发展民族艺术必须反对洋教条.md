Developing National Art Must Oppose Foreign Dogmatism
Zhang Geng

I. First, Clarify the Arguments

Recently, articles by comrades Chen Yi, Li Ling, Cheng Yun, and Zhi Xiu have been published in newspapers in succession, discussing the inheritance of national cultural traditions and the study of Western culture. I feel that there is now a tendency to seize upon phrases like "neither Chinese nor Western, a mix of Chinese and Western," and "coexistence of Chinese and foreign" as faults to be condemned. These phrases of Comrade Chen Yi may be unclear, but to say that they are crimes that must be denounced, I think we should hold back for a moment and clarify the arguments first.

Since the May Fourth Movement, two types of things (or forms) that are not entirely the same in nature have actually appeared in Chinese art (I will not discuss literature here for now, as the issues in literature are more complex): one is the traditional art of thousands of years, such as opera, storytelling, and traditional Chinese painting; the other is Western art introduced to China since the May Fourth Movement, such as spoken drama, Western music, and oil painting. The latter, although foreign in form, has, over decades, used the Chinese language (or Chinese musical language, etc.), consciously striving to express Chinese life, and has become an integral part of Chinese culture or art. In particular, art forms such as salvation songs, spoken drama, and woodcuts were closely linked to the struggle life of the masses during their growth process, expressing the suffering and heroism of that era, and in the process, produced many art warriors such as Nie Er and Xian Xinghai. Of course, we cannot say that the new art since the May Fourth Movement is not national, and we should not have any doubts about the national form of salvation songs, spoken drama, and woodcuts. But first, have these art forms penetrated the masses so deeply that they are loved by the broad masses of people, and have they achieved a solid foundation like traditional opera, folk songs, and New Year pictures? They are still lacking in that respect. Second, we must also admit that orchestral music, ballet, oil painting, and Western-style solo and choral singing have either been introduced for a very short time, or although they have been introduced for a considerable time, they have been detached from the masses in the past, existing only in the life circles of a very few people, and there has not been much creation in expressing national life, so the masses are even more unfamiliar with them and feel that they are less relevant. Of course, since they have been introduced and Chinese artists are working hard to study them, we cannot doubt that they are a component of Chinese art and culture.

On the other hand, traditional art has a long history of development, and with a few special exceptions, it is loved by the broad masses of people. In the long-term development, it has formed its own complete and strict form, with its own artistic rules. Its shortcomings are, first, that there are still some difficulties in expressing modern life; and second, that its artistic rules do not have complete and systematic theories like Western art, only fragmented anecdotal experiences. This latter point hinders its development.

Our generation of artists wants to build diverse new arts that are both Chinese and modern, that can well express the new life and new characters of modern China, and can also express historical life with new perspectives. This requires traditional art to be continuously improved towards modernization, and foreign art forms to make great efforts towards Sinicization. This requires traditional art to appropriately absorb some foreign nutrients on its own basis that will not only not damage its own style, but also benefit its own development. It also requires foreign art forms to make more conscious efforts to reach the masses, and to guard against detachment from the masses. That is to say, strive to absorb nutrients from those indigenous arts, and strive to put themselves into the masses for testing, so that they can grow into the masses. Of course, the first thing is to master and be proficient in the original foreign skills.

These two types of art should coexist, but they also need to learn from each other. This should be undisputed, because the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new" has long been established. There is no problem of "well water does not violate river water" or "inviting good things from abroad as guests" as Comrade Cheng Yun said. But we oppose ignoring the fact that there are various different problems in our modern culture, we oppose deliberately not mentioning this obvious distinction or deliberately using phrases such as "Is ballet a Russian national form?" "Symphony is shared by the international family" to confuse the issue. Ballet is a uniquely creative art of Russia, but they do not stop creating the Moiseyev Dance Company or the Beryozka Dance Ensemble just because they have the Bolshoi Theatre. In the Soviet Union, they advocate "coexistence". Hungary is a country with a very developed symphony orchestra, but they use national orchestras to perform Liszt's works and are welcomed in the world, winning the first prize at the Youth Festival. It is precisely because they allow various art forms to develop in their own way that they can each achieve results.

II. Then Look at the Reality

It is meaningful to study why comrades Cheng Yun and Li Ling are so opposed to "coexistence." They have devoted many articles to expressing their anger and indignation at the term "Chinese and Western," but in reality, they are dissatisfied with the idea of "coexistence." The term "Chinese and Western" is indeed not clear, but this is not the key issue, the key is in the point of "coexistence." What they resolutely oppose is "coexistence."

For example, Comrade Cheng Yun emphasizes the primitive backwardness of Chinese music. In 1954, he said in an article on the reform of opera music that opera music uses a set of "ready-made tunes" in common, so "this music is not characterized but typified." He also said: "Why do we say it is a primitive and backward phenomenon? Since the 'Southern Drama' of the Southern Song Dynasty, for eight hundred years, opera music has changed back and forth but has not run out of this circle, and has not jumped out of this rule—a set of music is used by everyone in common." Perhaps after two years, his thinking has changed, but in May 1955, in his report to all opera performers and workers at the third Wuhan Opera Festival, he still said: "The original music in opera was produced on the backward basis of the small-scale peasant economy and the small-scale commodity economy of the city," and "in the new society, the economic foundation has changed, people's thoughts and feelings have also changed, and the drama art that reflects these things must also change from content to means." "Otherwise, it will lag behind reality." And lagging behind reality will inevitably "still promote the feudal landlord class." The hat added is not small. (I completely agree with Comrade Zhi Xiu's criticism of this vulgar sociological theory and will not repeat it.)

The purpose of saying these things is to change it. For example, percussion instruments should be changed. Because it is "deafening," or euphemistically, "after all, it is a noisy instrument, and its expressiveness is always worse than that of orchestral instruments in most cases," therefore, "I think the fundamental way is to gradually strengthen the orchestral setting of the orchestra, absorb the rhythmic essence of the existing suitable 'gong and drum tunes,' and create new orchestral pieces that can replace percussion instruments and gradually replace them. The strong percussion pieces should gradually give way to new pieces composed of musical sounds."

Now you understand! "Coexistence" is not allowed, it must be "replaced"! The symphony orchestra must replace percussion instruments, new pieces must replace "primitive" opera music, and Chinese opera must be transformed according to the form of Western opera! This is the essence of the problem.

"Theory" is not terrible, the most terrible thing is the practice of "theory"!

Based on this "theory," new Chuju repertoires have been composed, and huge orchestras have been used for accompaniment. As a result, the performers have found it very difficult to learn. For one play, they have learned many new pieces, they cannot hear the transitions clearly, they do not know where to start singing, and after a lot of effort, the audience's response is: this is not Chuju. They come to ask the troupe "when will you perform Chuju?" According to the performers, the old artists have become laymen and have nowhere to use their talents in the troupe. The common people do not like such new plays, and the performers are also very depressed. In recent years, Chuju has not actually been improved and developed. Some band members in the troupes do not want to engage in local opera and want to take the music academy exams. Young people also look down on Chuju, and many people want to change careers.

Where is this developing tradition? This is simply destroying tradition, demolishing tradition. If we do not examine it from reality, it is very difficult to see the problem.

III. The Ideological Root Lies in Dogmatism

Why oppose "coexistence"? Now we can see clearly that it is because you (traditional art) are too backward. If you do not carry out a "transformation" according to the laws of "progressive" Western art, you have no right to survive. Since the issue of "existence" is still an issue, "co-" is naturally even more out of the question; because one is "being transformed" and the other is the "transformer," how can they "co-exist"?

The seriousness of the problem is that people who hold this theory are not just Comrade Cheng Yun alone. Although these people can say many things about valuing national heritage, they are essentially belittling national heritage. They simply do not love opera. They never consider that any national art form, such as opera, must have its own special rules, and it is absolutely impossible to forcibly apply the rules of foreign art forms, such as Western opera. This forced application makes us feel that Chinese art is "not up to standard" everywhere and is unsightly everywhere. And Western art has become a typical model, worthy of learning everywhere. For example, Western opera is opera, dance drama is dance drama, but China is different. Singing, dancing, performing, acrobatics... etc. are integrated to form opera. But Comrade Cheng Yun and those who feel the same way do not see it this way, they must say that opera is opera, they must exaggerate and expand the normal position of music in opera. From this point of view, looking at the music in opera, this is not right, that is not right. They have never seriously studied the special functions and roles of percussion instruments in opera, and they think they have the full right to deny it. They have never seriously studied the different positions and functions of opera singing and Western opera music in the whole play, and the different relationships between them and language, and they think they have the right to add the label of "backward" to compare with the "progressive" crown of Western opera music. Where does this blind self-confidence come from? I think there is nothing else but a kind of artistic dogmatism, a kind of thought that mechanically transplants foreign dogmas without digesting them.

The seriousness of the problem is that this kind of dogmatic thinking has a certain market in the art world, and a considerable number of people believe in it. And what makes the problem serious is that these theories are put into practice in many, many artistic creations. This theory is very destructive to the tradition of national art. My opinions are not just to oppose Comrade Cheng Yun. But in order to better inherit and carry forward the national art heritage, I think we must resolutely oppose this tendency of dogmatism.

To oppose dogmatism, we must advocate serious study of the reality of Chinese art, study opera, study Chinese music, study Chinese art. Before studying, we must abandon the prejudice of foreign dogmas and proceed from reality. Here, foreign artistic theories have an enlightening and referential value for us. If we close our minds and refuse to learn from the established systematic theories of foreign countries, it is wrong, but it is completely wrong to blindly believe in the articles that foreigners have summarized and elevated into theories from the actual art of foreign countries, thinking that they can be applied item by item to the actual art of our country and become the absolute standard for measuring our art.

    发展民族艺术必须反对洋教条
    张庚
    一、首先要搞清论点
    最近在报纸上接连发表了陈沂、李凌、程云、志修等几位同志的文章，讨论继承民族文化传统和学习西洋的问题。我觉得现在颇有抓住了“不中不西、中西混杂”、“中外并存”等几句话头当小辫子来问罪的形势。陈沂同志这几句话，说得不清楚则有之，如说这就是罪名，必须加以讨伐，我看还是且慢，先把论点弄清了再说。
    五四以来，在我国艺术上（我这里且不谈文学，因为文学的问题更复杂些）实际是出现了两类性质不完全相同的东西（或形式）：一类是几千年来传统的艺术，如戏曲、说唱、国画之类，另一类是五四以来介绍到中国来的西洋文艺，如话剧、西洋音乐、油画之类。后面的一类，固然是外来的形式，但经过了几十年的时光，运用中国的语言（或中国音乐语言等），有意识地努力表现中国的生活，它们也已成为中国文化或文艺中不可分割的一部分了。特别其中如救亡歌曲、话剧、木刻等艺术形式，在它们的成长过程中，和群众的斗争生活密切地联系起来，表现了这个时代的苦难生活、英雄气概，并且在这个斗争的过程中，出现了聂耳、冼星海等许多艺术战士。我们当然不能说，五四以来的新文艺不是民族的，我们对于救亡歌曲、话剧、木刻等艺术形式之为民族形式是不应当有什么怀疑的。但是第一，这些艺术形式是否就那么深入群众，为广大的人民所喜闻乐见了，能和传统久远的戏曲、民歌、年画等同样取得了深厚基础呢？那却还差些。第二，我们还得承认，管弦乐、芭蕾舞、油画、西洋式的独唱合唱，它们有的介绍进来的日子很短，有的介绍进来的日子虽也相当长，但由于过去脱离群众，只在极少数人的生活圈子里存在，并且在表现民族生活上的创造也还不多，因而群众就对它更生疏，更感到关系少了。当然，由于已经介绍过来，又有中国的艺术家在努力钻研，也不能怀疑它是中国艺术文化的一个组成部分。
    另一面，传统的艺术的发展历史长，除了一些特殊的例外，它们都是为广大群众所喜闻乐见的。在长期发展中，又形成了自己完整严格的形式，有自己的艺术规律。它的缺点，其一是在表现现代生活上还存在若干困难；又一是它的那些艺术规律，不像西洋艺术似的有完整、系统的理论，只有零星断片的经验谈。这后一点对它的发展是有妨碍的。
    我们这一代的艺术家，是要建设多种多样既是中国又是现代的新艺术，它们能很好地表现现代中国的新生活、新人物，又能用新的观点去表现历史的生活。这就要求传统的艺术朝着现代化不断改进，而外来的艺术朝着中国化方面作巨大的努力。这就需要传统艺术在自己的基础上适当地吸收一些不仅仅不致破坏了自己的风格，而且有益于本身发展的外来营养。也要求外来的艺术形式更有意识地努力群众化，并且提防自己的脱离群众。这就是说努力向那些土生土长的艺术，吸取营养，努力把自己放到群众中去考验，让它生长到群众中去。当然，首先要掌握和精通那些原有的外来技巧。
    这两类艺术应当并存，但也需要互相学习。这应当是没有争论的，因为“百花齐放，推陈出新”是早已定下的方针。这里并没有程云同志所说的“井水不犯河水”的问题，或者“把外国的好东西请进来作客”的问题。但是我们反对无视我国现代文化中存在着各种不同问题的情况，我们反对故意不提这种明显的区别或者故意拿一些什么“芭蕾舞是不是俄罗斯民族形式”“交响乐是国际大家庭所共有的”话头来打混。芭蕾舞是俄罗斯有独创性的艺术，但他们并不因为有了莫斯科大剧院就不再创立莫伊谢耶夫歌舞团或小白桦树舞蹈团，在苏联，他们是提倡“并存”的。匈牙利是个交响乐很发达的国家，但他们却以民族乐队表演李斯特的作品，在世界上受到欢迎，在青年联欢节上得第一奖。正因为他们都是让各种艺术形式按自己的路子发展，所以各自都能做出成绩来。
    二、然后来看看实际
    我们如果来研究一下程云、李凌同志为什么那么反对“并存”，是有意义的事。他们把许多文章做在对于“中西”这种提法的表示愤慨激昂上面，实则是对于“并存”提法的不满。“中西”这种提法不明确是事实，但是这并不是问题的关键，关键是在“并存”这一点上。他们所坚决反对的是“并存”。
    比方说程云同志，他是强调中国音乐的原始落后的。1954年他曾经在一篇论戏曲音乐改革的文章中说戏曲中间“诸剧共用”一套“现成的曲调”，所以“这种音乐不是性格化而是类型化的”，他还说：“为什么说它是原始的落后现象呢？我国迄自南宋之‘南戏’起到今天止，八百年来戏曲音乐变来变去仍未跑出这一个圈子，仍未跳出这一个法则——一套音乐众人公用”。也许事隔两年了，他的思想有了变化也说不定。但是在1955年5月，他在武汉市第三届戏曲观摩演出大会上对全体戏曲艺人、工作者做的报告中，仍是说：“戏曲中原有的音乐，产生在旧时代小农经济与城市的小商品经济的落后基础之上，”而“新的社会，经济基础变了，人的思想情感也变了，反映这些事物的戏剧艺术从内容到手段也要跟着变才行。”“否则便会落后于现实。”而落后于现实就不免“仍然为封建地主阶级宣传了”。加的帽子是不小的。（对于这种庸俗社会学的理论，我完全同意志修同志的批评，就不重复了。）
    说了这些，其目的是要改。比方说，打击乐器要改。因为它“震耳欲聋”，或者委婉点说，“究属噪音乐器，表现力在多数场合比之管弦乐器总是差的”，因此，“我以为根本的办法是要逐步加强乐队的管弦设置，吸取现有适用的‘锣鼓曲牌’的节奏精华，创作新的可以代替打击乐的新的乐队曲而逐步取而代之。强烈的打击乐曲要让它渐渐让位于乐音组成的新曲”。
    这下子明白了吧！“并存”是不能容许的，必须“取而代之”！必须用管弦乐队代替打击乐，用新曲代替“原始的”戏曲音乐，必须按西洋歌剧形式改造中国戏曲！这就是问题的实质。
      “理论”还不可怕，最可怕的是“理论”的实践！
    根据这样的“理论”，楚剧的新剧目就进行了作曲，就运用了巨大的乐队来伴奏。结果，艺人学得十分吃力，演一个戏，学了许多新曲，过门也听不清，不知道从那里唱起，费了大力之后，得到的观众反映是：这不是楚剧。他们来问剧团“什么时候演楚剧？”据艺人的反映：在剧团里老艺人反成了外行，无用武之地。老百姓对于这样的新戏不喜欢，艺人也很苦闷。这几年来楚剧实际上没有得到提高和发展。一些剧团的乐队人员不想搞地方戏，要去考音乐院。年轻人也瞧不起楚剧，许多人想转业。
    这哪里是发展传统呢？这只是破坏传统，摧毁传统。如果不从实际来检验，那是很不容易看出问题来的。
              三、思想根源在于教条主义
    为什么要反对“并存”呢？现在可以看清楚了，那是因为你（传统艺术）太落后，如不按“进步”的西洋艺术的规律进行一番“改造”，那是没有任何生存权的。“存”的问题既然还是一个问题，“并”自然更说不上了；因为一个是“被改造”，一个是“改造者”，怎么能够“并”呢？
    问题的严重在于持有这种理论的人，并不只程云同志一个，这些人虽然嘴里可以说许多重视民族遗产的话，但实质上是轻视民族遗产的。他们对于戏曲根本就不爱。他们从来不去考虑一下，任何一种民族艺术形式，比方戏曲罢，必然有它自己的特殊规律，绝对不可以拿外国艺术形式的规律，比方西洋歌剧的规律来硬套。这种硬套的办法，使我们首先就感到中国的艺术处处“不合规格”，处处看不顺眼。而西洋的艺术就成了典型模范，处处值得学习。比方说，西洋歌剧是歌剧，舞剧是舞剧，中国却不同，歌、舞、表演、杂技……等等综合在一起构成了戏曲。但程云同志以及和他同感的人却不是这样看，一定要说戏曲是歌剧，一定要把音乐在戏曲中的正常地位予以夸大扩张，从这个观点出发来看戏曲中的音乐，这也不是，那也不是。他们从来没有认真去研究一下打击乐器在戏曲中间的特殊功能和作用，就认为自己有充分的权利去否定它。从来没有认真去研究一下戏曲唱腔和西洋歌剧乐曲之间的在整个戏中间的不同的地位、不同的功能，它们和语言之间的不同的关系，就认为有权利给加上“落后”的帽子，以与西洋歌剧音乐的“进步”花冠相对比。这种盲目的自信到底从何而来呢？我觉得没有别的，只是一种艺术上的教条主义，一种食而不化地硬搬洋教条的思想在作怪而已。
    问题的严重在于这种教条主义思想在艺术界中间是有一定的市场的，是有相当一部分人信奉的。而使得问题严重的又在于这些理论是在许多许多艺术创造中付诸实行的。这种理论对于民族艺术传统的破坏性是很大的。我的这些意见，并不是专为了反对程云同志。而是为了很好地继承与发扬民族艺术遗产，我觉得我们必须坚决反对这种教条主义的倾向。
    要反对教条主义，必须提倡认真研究中国艺术的实际，研究戏曲，研究中国音乐，研究中国美术。在研究之先，必须抛开洋教条的成见，从实际出发。在这里，外国的艺术理论对于我们有启发的作用，参考的价值。如果深闭固拒，不去借鉴外国已成系统的理论是不对的，但迷信外国人从外国的艺术实际中所总结提升为理论的条文，以为可以逐条运用在我国艺术实际上面，成为衡量我国艺术的绝对标准，那却是完全错误的。
