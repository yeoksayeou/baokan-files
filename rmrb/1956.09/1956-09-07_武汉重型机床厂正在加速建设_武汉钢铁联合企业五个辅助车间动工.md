Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 6th -- On a vast expanse of land near the East Lake scenic area in Wuhan, the outline of a modern heavy machine tool plant is clearly taking shape. At this time last year, there were only a few graders leveling the ground for the construction of this factory, and a small number of construction workers were building simple temporary sheds. Now, with the emergence of clusters of buildings and tens of thousands of builders, this place has become a vibrant area.

The head of the factory's planning department told reporters that according to the original plan, the factory was scheduled to be fully completed by the end of 1959, with full-scale production starting in early 1960. In order to adapt to the needs of the country's accelerated socialist construction, at the beginning of this year, the factory made a decision to complete the factory construction project one and a half years ahead of schedule, that is, to fully complete the factory by the second quarter of 1958, and to start full-scale production in the third quarter of that year. At present, of the fifty construction projects that must be completed to build this factory, thirteen have been fully completed, and fourteen are under accelerated construction. It is expected that by the end of the year, the number of completed and under-construction projects will continue to increase to thirty-four. A number of workshops in the carpentry and tool repair factory buildings will begin to be put into production.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 5th -- Five auxiliary repair projects of the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise have started construction one after another. These projects are the metal structure workshop, the machine repair workshop, the electrical repair workshop, the forging workshop, and the automobile repair workshop.

The metal structure workshop, which started construction the earliest, is now installing the roof trusses and roof panels of the factory building. In the other four workshops, some are about to hoist reinforced concrete columns, and some are carrying out foundation work.

The auxiliary repair facilities of the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise include more than forty construction projects such as repair workshops, warehouses, and office buildings. In the future, they will process, assemble, and repair non-standard equipment and various parts for the Iron and Steel United Enterprise. During the construction of the Iron and Steel United Enterprise, they will first serve the basic construction projects.

    武汉重型机床厂正在加速建设
    武汉钢铁联合企业五个辅助车间动工
    据新华社武汉6日电　在武汉东湖风景区附近一片空旷的土地上，一个现代化的重型机床厂的轮廓清晰地呈现在人们眼前了。去年这个时候，这儿只有几台平土机在开始为建设这个工厂而进行着平土工作，另外还有为数很少的建筑工人在建筑简易的临时工棚。而现在，随着成群的建筑物和数以万计的建设者的出现，这儿已经成为一个生气勃勃的地带了。
    工厂计划部门的负责人告诉记者说，按照原订计划，这个厂全部建成的期限是1959年年底，1960年初全面开工生产。为了适应国家社会主义建设加速进行的需要，在今年年初，工厂作出了提前一年半完成建厂工程的决定，就是说，要在1958年第二季度就把工厂全部建成，到这年的第三季度就可全面开工生产了。目前，为建成这个工厂所必须完成的五十个工程项目中，有十三项已经全部完工，有十四项在加速施工。预计到年底，完工和施工的工程项目将继续增加到三十四个。木工和工具修理厂房将有一批车间开始投入生产。
    新华社武汉5日电　武汉钢铁联合企业有五项辅助修理工程先后开工。这些工程是金属结构车间、机修车间、电修车间、锻造车间和汽车修理车间。
    开工最早的金属结构车间，现在正在安装厂房的屋架和屋面板。在其他四个车间，有的就要吊装钢筋混凝土柱子，有的正在进行基础工程。
    武汉钢铁联合企业的辅助修理设施，共包括修理车间、仓库、办公楼等四十多个工程项目。它们将来要为钢铁联合企业加工、装配和修理非标准设备和各种配件。在钢铁联合企业建设期间，它们将先为基本建设工程服务。
