    Beijing Citizens Urgently Demand Improvement of Vegetable Supply Work
    Editor's Note: The vegetable supply work in Beijing has made achievements. However, according to various reports: the phenomenon of consumers not being able to eat fresh vegetables is still quite serious; the vegetable company's exclusive purchase of suburban vegetables requires a lot of effort, but still often loses money due to too many circulation links; vegetable producers have many opinions because of complicated purchasing procedures and not completely reasonable prices. These problems should be solved in a timely manner, otherwise, it will not only affect the lives of urban residents, but also be detrimental to the development of vegetable production. It is hoped that the relevant departments in Beijing will study these opinions and quickly take effective measures to improve the vegetable supply work.
    "When Can We Eat Fresh Vegetables?"
    Residents' Opinions on Vegetable Supply in Beijing
Recently, I participated in several residents' forums in Shaanxi Lane, Beiqiaowan, and Xixiejie outside Qianmen in Beijing, and heard some of their opinions on vegetable supply. I have compiled them for relevant departments to study and resolve. The most unsatisfactory thing for residents is that many vegetable stalls adopt the "discard the old and store the new" method of selling vegetables, which prevents residents from often eating fresh vegetables, and some fresh vegetables rot in large quantities. Residents personally saw that the first joint group in Shaanxi Lane outside Qianmen did not sell fresh cabbages and tomatoes, but had to sell the rotten ones first. One evening, the seventeenth joint group in Xidan purchased a large batch of fresh vegetables, but the next morning they still sold the stale vegetables left over from the day before. The third joint group in Xidan purchased three hundred catties of new tomatoes on the evening of July 31, but what they sold was still rotten goods. On August 1, the fourth state-owned meat station in Xidan also had a lot of fresh tomatoes and cucumbers, covered with mats in the back and not sold, and some of the tomatoes sold were so rotten that they were flowing straight out of the basket, smelling sour and foul.
      Because good vegetables are kept unsold, more and more rotten vegetables are produced. Residents reflected: "The first joint group in Shaanxi Lane hauls whole baskets of rotten tomatoes to the garbage station, and rotten potatoes are hauled away by the whole car." Cai Yuhe, director of the Xixiejie Residents Committee, said: "The garbage trucks are busy hauling the rotten vegetables from the vegetable stations, and they can't even haul away the garbage on the streets." Residents saw the good vegetables rotting and said with great pain: "Farmers sow seeds and cultivate seedlings, every drop of sweat falls to the ground and splits into eight pieces, working hard all day long, in order to let us residents of the capital eat fresh vegetables. But this summer, we have never bought fresh vegetables once." Cai Yuhe said: "This peak season, I only bought two fresh cucumbers."
    Residents also have a lot of opinions on queuing to buy vegetables, which takes a long time. Many residents queued for a long time, but still couldn't buy vegetables. One resident went to the Rongxian Hutong Cooperative to buy chives and stood in line for two hours without buying any. Some residents bring small stools to the vegetable stall in front of the door as early as four o'clock in the morning to sit and wait to buy vegetables. A resident surnamed Tan said: "We buy vegetables now, it's like betting, we don't know where to go every day to buy them, especially buying vegetables on holidays is even more difficult."
    Residents also raised many opinions on the inability of vegetable trucks to supply vegetables in a timely manner. Residents of Anfu Hutong in Xidan reflected: "This spring, there were often more than a dozen vegetable trucks going back and forth in the alley, and you could buy vegetables just by walking out the door, but now there is only one vegetable truck, one vegetable stall (two people) and one oil and salt shop (only two people selling vegetables)". Jin Yuhuai said: "Now the vegetable trucks only leave at nine o'clock, starting to sell from the north entrance of the alley, and before reaching the south entrance, they are all rotten vegetables, and sometimes there are no vegetables at all." The vegetable trucks in Qianyingzi and Xiaoyingzi Hutongs in Xidan sometimes arrive at twelve noon or six in the evening, and they are all rotten vegetables. Residents call these vegetable trucks "junk sellers."
    Residents also talked about the poor service attitude of many vegetable sellers. The staff of the fourth state-owned meat station in Xidan and the Wanfengxiang Oil and Salt Shop, a joint state-private enterprise, do not patiently tell customers what vegetables are available, often causing customers to queue for a long time and still not buy the vegetables they want. Customers raised opinions on the seventeenth joint group in Xidan not selling good vegetables, and the salesperson said bluntly: "I want the vegetables to rot, is it your business!" Residents are also dissatisfied with the service attitude of Kang Shouyi, the vegetable truck salesperson of the first joint group in Shaanxi Lane outside Qianmen. Residents asked him: "Why are these vegetables all rotten?" He said: "Take it or leave it, this is it, if you don't want it, forget it." While saying that, he snatched the vegetables from the customer's hand, threw them on the car, turned around and left. The service attitude of some vegetable sellers in the eleventh joint group in Xidan is even worse. Dong Guiqing said: "One day, about twenty or thirty people stood in line to buy cucumbers. When the residents were picking cucumbers to prepare to weigh them, the salesperson glared at them, slammed the scale, and announced: 'No more sales', and then turned around and left. After the customers repeatedly begged, they finally invited the salesperson back. He turned around and lectured the customers, saying: 'Just this once, never again next time'."
    Residents also reflected that retail vegetable prices are unreasonable and the sanitary conditions of retail outlets are generally poor. Inferior vegetables sell for a lot of money, and good vegetables don't sell for much more. The vegetable trucks are loaded with rotten vegetables every day and dumped into the sewage pool at the north entrance of Xixiejie, and nearby residents can no longer dump sewage, so the residents on duty on the street have to clean up for them every day. The corn at the fourth state-owned meat station in Xidan is also piled up in the courtyard on rainy days, and some of the corn is soaked in sewage and stinks, but it is still sold after the rain.
    Residents are eagerly awaiting these problems in vegetable retail work to be resolved quickly.

### “几时才能让我们吃上新鲜菜”？

专栏：

    北京市民迫切要求改进蔬菜供应工作
    编者按　北京市的蔬菜供应工作是有成绩的。但是，据各方面反映：消费者吃不到新鲜菜蔬的现象还相当严重；蔬菜公司全部包销郊区蔬菜，用了很大力量，但因流转环节过多，还经常赔钱；蔬菜生产者因为收购手续繁杂、价格不完全合理，有许多意见。这些问题应该及时加以解决，否则，不仅影响城市居民的生活，对蔬菜生产的发展也很不利。希望北京市有关部门研究这些意见，迅速采取有效措施，改进蔬菜供应工作。
    “几时才能让我们吃上新鲜菜”？
    北京居民对蔬菜供应的意见最近，我参加了北京市前门外陕西巷、北桥湾，西单西斜街等地的几个居民座谈会，听到他们对蔬菜供应的一些意见。现整理出来供有关部门研究解决。居民最不满意的是许多售菜点采用“推陈储新”的售菜法，使居民经常吃不到新鲜菜，有些新鲜菜大量烂掉了。居民亲眼见到前门外陕西巷联营一组有鲜洋白菜、西红柿不卖，非要先卖烂的不可。一天晚上西单联营十七组，购进大批鲜菜，但第二天早晨仍先卖前天卖剩的陈菜。西单联营三组7月31日晚购进了三百斤新西红柿，而卖的仍是烂货。8月1日西单国营第四肉站也有不少鲜西红柿和黄瓜，放在后面用席盖着不卖，卖的西红柿有的烂得从筐内直往外流水，酸臭扑鼻。
      因为留着好菜不卖，霉烂的菜愈来愈多。居民反映：“陕西巷联营一组把整筐整筐的烂西红柿往垃圾站上抬，烂土豆整汽车的被拉走。”西斜街居民委员会主任蔡玉和说：“垃圾车忙着拉菜站的烂菜，连街道上的垃圾也拉不过来了。”居民看到好菜烂掉了，很痛心地说：“农民播种育苗，一滴汗珠掉地摔八瓣，整天辛辛苦苦，为的是让我们首都居民吃到新鲜蔬菜。可是今年一个夏天，我们从来没有买到过一次新鲜菜吃。”蔡玉和说：“今年旺季，我只买到过两条新鲜黄瓜。”
    居民对排队买菜，费时很长也很有意见。许多居民排了很长时间的队，也买不到菜。一个居民，到绒线胡同合作社去买韭菜，站了两个钟头的队也没买着。有些居民，从早晨四时就带小板凳到售菜店门前坐着等候买菜。一个姓谭的居民说：“我们现在买菜，好像押宝似的，每天不知道该上那个地方去才能买到，尤其是假日买菜更是费劲。”
    对菜车不能及时供应蔬菜，居民也提出不少意见。西单安福胡同居民反映：“今春胡同里常有十几辆菜车来来去去，走出门口就可买到蔬菜，但现在只有一辆菜车，一个菜摊（二人）和一个油盐店（卖菜的只二人）”。金玉怀说：“现在菜车九时才出车，由胡同北口开始卖，到不了南口，就都是烂菜了，有时就根本没菜了。”西单前英子和小英子胡同的菜车，有时到中午十二时、晚六时才来到，而且拉去的都是烂菜。居民称这些菜车是“卖破烂的”。
    居民还谈到许多售菜员服务态度不好。西单国营第四肉站、公私合营万丰祥油盐店的店员，不耐心告诉顾客有些什么菜，往往使顾客排队半天，还买不到自己要买的菜。顾客对西单联营十七组不售好菜提出意见，售货员很生硬地说：“我愿意叫菜烂，你管的着吗！”居民对前门外陕西巷联营一组菜车售菜员康寿益的服务态度也不满意。居民问他：“你这菜怎么都烂了？”他说：“要不要，就这个，不要拉倒。”一面说，一面夺回顾客手中的菜，往车上一摔，转身就走。西单联营十一组有的售菜员的服务态度更坏。董桂清说：“一天，约二、三十人站队买黄瓜，当居民挑选黄瓜准备过秤时，售菜员就眼睛一瞪，把秤一摔，宣布说：‘不卖了’，随即扭头就走，后经顾客再三央求，才把这位售菜员请回来。他反过来教训顾客说：‘就是这一回，下次可不成’”。
    居民还反映零售菜价不合理及零售点卫生状况普遍很差。次菜不少卖钱，好菜也不多卖钱。菜车天天满载烂菜，倒入西斜街北口的污水池内，附近居民无法再倒污水，弄得街道值班居民天天还要给他们收拾。国营西单第四肉站的玉米，下雨天也堆在院子内，有些玉米被污水浸得发臭，但雨后照样出售。
    居民们迫切期待着蔬菜零售工作上的这些问题迅速得到解决。
