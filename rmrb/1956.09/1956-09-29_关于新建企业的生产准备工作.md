On Production Preparation Work for Newly Established Enterprises
Comrade Ren Zhongyi, First Secretary of the CPC Harbin Municipal Committee, speaks:

From Harbin's construction over the past few years, we have deeply realized that conscientiously doing a good job in production preparation work, enabling newly built and expanded enterprises to go into production on schedule, quickly reach design levels, and fully exert the effectiveness of national investment, is an extremely important but often overlooked issue.

I wholeheartedly support Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech and fully agree with the three reports of the Central Committee.

In recent years, with the country's planned economic construction, Harbin's industrial construction has developed rapidly, with many new and expanded factories. Among the 156 key projects designed with Soviet assistance, 13 are located in Harbin. By the end of 1957, the newly built and expanded parts of the city's total industrial output value will account for about 75 percent. As one of the country's key construction cities, Harbin has developed from a consumer city with a relatively weak industrial base into a new, important industrial city dominated by the machinery industry. The city's population has now increased from more than 700,000 in 1949 to 1.4 million, with employees and their families accounting for more than 80 percent of the total.

In Harbin's industrial construction over the past few years, we have deeply realized that conscientiously doing a good job in production preparation work, enabling newly built and expanded enterprises to go into production on schedule, quickly reach design capacity, and fully exert the effectiveness of national investment, is an extremely important but often overlooked issue. Comrade Zhou Enlai pointed out in his report that newly built and renovated enterprises have great potential, and in order to fully exploit this potential, the primary issue is to strengthen production preparation work. We believe that this is very correct and consistent with Harbin's situation.

Facts have proven that some newly built factories have produced two different results because they adopted two different methods for this issue. For example, the Harbin Flax Factory and the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory were both designed and built with Soviet assistance and had Soviet experts to help them, but the results after they were put into production were different. The flax factory did almost no production preparation work before starting operations, resulting in long-term chaos after it was completed and started production in 1952. Production gradually normalized and reached design capacity only in 1954 (exceeding design capacity only this year). Although the production technology of the measuring & cutting tool factory is more complex and requires stricter requirements than the flax factory, the production preparation work before starting operations was done better, and a comprehensive plan and measures for how to achieve design capacity after going into production were formulated. Therefore, the factory reached design capacity in only one and a half years (half the stipulated time) after national acceptance. For newly built enterprises such as the measuring & cutting tool factory and the electric meter instrument factory, the output value in about one year after reaching design capacity is equal to the total investment in the construction of the factory, and the profits turned over in two or three years can recover the entire investment in the construction of the factory. From this, it can be seen how significant it is for the country's socialist construction, especially for accelerating socialist industrialization, to conscientiously do a good job in production preparation work, so that newly built enterprises can be put into production on schedule or ahead of schedule and quickly reach design capacity.

However, due to insufficient understanding and emphasis on the importance of production preparation work, the production preparation work of many newly built and expanded enterprises is not good enough. As a result, either the time to put into production is delayed, or problems often occur after putting into production. For example, the control switch workshop of the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory should have started production next year, but only one technician has been sent there recently; the paint resin workshop of the insulating materials factory has not yet started production since its completion in 1953 due to the lack of major equipment; the electric meter instrument factory lacks more than 100 kinds of tools and fixtures, resulting in the delay of switch meter production for more than two months, and causing the bad consequence of failing to complete the plan every month after starting operations. As for the suspension of work and stagnation caused by the failure of raw material supply to meet production needs, it is even more of a widespread phenomenon. Many enterprises cannot formulate production organization designs and establish various production management systems in a timely manner according to the scale, product characteristics, and process routes of the factory. After putting into production, departmental responsibilities are unclear, they are constantly shirking responsibility with each other, production order is chaotic, and defective products are frequently produced, seriously affecting the completion of production tasks. It should be particularly pointed out that some factories, after being built, cannot timely determine product plans and production tasks due to leadership, and production plans are often changed, thus affecting the planned production preparation work and normal production. The Harbin Boiler Factory was originally planned to be completed in 1957. In order to accelerate the progress of the project and put it into production ahead of schedule, it carried out intense winter construction last year and will be fully completed in October this year, but the production task for next year has not yet been determined. According to the director of the factory, 14 Soviet experts have been in the factory for half a year, but because there is no production task, there is no work to do, and by March next year, seven experts will have their terms expired and return home. This not only wastes the strength of the experts, but also causes losses to the country. Some factories also have similar problems.

The reasons for the above-mentioned problems, in addition to the objective reasons such as our country's weak industrial base, low technical level, and lack of experience in socialist industrial construction, are mainly caused by insufficient ideological understanding and emphasis. For example, during the construction period of the flax factory, it was precisely because the enterprise leadership had the idea of "waiting until the basic construction is completed before engaging in production preparation," so the production preparation work was delayed and not done well. It is also because of insufficient understanding of the importance of production preparation work that some newly built enterprises neglect to establish and improve the organization for production preparation work in a timely manner during the construction process, and do not put production preparation work in an important position for a long time, thus hindering the smooth development of industrial production.

All the above-mentioned phenomena are inseparable from the leadership of the municipal party committee. In the past few years, the municipal party committee's leadership of the production preparation work of newly built and expanded enterprises has been very inadequate, with insufficient ideological emphasis, lack of regular supervision and inspection, and especially neglecting to timely summarize the experience and lessons of this work. This should be seriously reviewed and quickly corrected.

Experience has proven that in order to earnestly do a good job in production preparation work, every newly built enterprise should put production preparation work in an important position of leadership from the beginning of the factory construction, and must overcome the tendency of only paying attention to basic construction but neglecting production preparation work. At the same time, every newly built enterprise should, from the beginning, make proper arrangements for various aspects of work such as civil engineering, installation, and production preparation according to the overall plan, so that they are interconnected. It is necessary to establish and strengthen the specialized management organization for production preparation work, formulate a comprehensive plan and specific measures for production preparation work, and ensure that newly built enterprises are ideologically, organizationally, planningly, institutionally, and especially technically and materially prepared in a timely and sufficient manner when they are put into production, and it is also necessary to earnestly do a good job in production cooperation with other relevant enterprises. The higher-level departments and bureaus must also stipulate and issue production tasks in advance before the newly built enterprises are put into production, so as to avoid the bad phenomenon that the factories are built but there are no production tasks, resulting in serious waste of national investment.

In order to do a good job in production preparation work, the local and enterprise party organizations and the higher-level departments and bureaus must strengthen the political and ideological leadership of production preparation work, thoroughly overcome the erroneous ideas of waiting, relying, and one-sidedly emphasizing objective difficulties in neglecting production preparation work; they must regularly put forward instructions and requirements related to production preparation work to enterprises, conduct strict supervision and inspection, and timely summarize and promote the experience of production preparation work. In view of the fact that one of the biggest difficulties for many newly built enterprises when they are put into production is often the lack of technical strength, in addition to continuing to rely on the strong support of old enterprises, it is also necessary to further strengthen the leadership of the higher-level departments and bureaus and local party organizations, especially the national and local labor departments, over various technical schools, and take various measures to train a large number of technical workers and increase technical strength. This is of decisive significance for ensuring that newly built enterprises are put into operation on schedule and operate normally. After the newly built enterprises are put into production, it is also necessary to educate and organize all employees to quickly learn and master new technologies, and strive to quickly reach the design level and fully exert the effectiveness of national investment.

    关于新建企业的生产准备工作
    中共哈尔滨市委员会第一书记　任仲夷同志的发言
    从哈尔滨市几年来的建设中，我们深深地体会到：切实作好生产准备工作，使新建和扩建企业按期投入生产，迅速达到设计水平，充分发挥国家投资效能，乃是一个极其重要的但是却往往被忽视的问题。
    我衷心地拥护毛泽东同志的开幕词，完全同意中央委员会的三个报告。
    最近几年来，在国家有计划的经济建设中，哈尔滨市的工业建设得到迅速的发展，新建和扩建工厂，大量增加。苏联帮助我国设计的一百五十六项重点工程，在哈尔滨市就有十三项。到一九五七年底，全市工业生产总值中的新建和扩建部分，将占百分之七十五左右。作为国家重点建设城市之一的哈尔滨，已经由一个工业基础比较薄弱的消费城市发展成一个以机械工业为主的新兴的重要的工业城市。现在全市人口已由一九四九年的七十余万人增至一百四十万人，全市职工及其家属，约占百分之八十以上。
    在哈尔滨市几年来的工业建设中，我们深深地体会到：切实作好生产准备工作，使新建与扩建企业按期投入生产，迅速达到设计能力，充分发挥国家投资效能，乃是一个极其重要的但却往往被忽视的问题。周恩来同志在报告中指出：新建和改建企业，有很大的潜力，为了充分发挥这种潜力，首要的问题是加强生产准备工作。我们认为，这是非常正确的，也是符合哈尔滨市的情况的。
    事实证明，有些新建工厂由于对于这个问题采取了两种不同的办法，因而就产生了两种不同的结果。例如哈尔滨亚麻厂与哈尔滨量具刃具厂，都是苏联帮助我们设计和建设起来的工厂，并且都有苏联专家的帮助，但是它们在投入生产以后的结果是不一样的。亚麻厂由于开工前几乎没有进行生产准备工作，以致一九五二年建成开始生产后，长期存在着混乱现象，直到一九五四年，生产才逐渐走向正常和达到设计能力（今年才超过设计能力）。量具刃具厂的生产技术虽然较亚麻工厂更为复杂、要求更为严格，但是由于开工前的生产准备工作作的比较好，并且制定了投入生产后如何达到设计能力的统盘要求和措施，因而该厂在国家验收后，仅用一年半的时间（较规定的期限提前一半）就达到了设计能力。像量具刃具厂、电表仪器厂等这样新建的企业，在达到设计能力后，大约一年的产值即等于建设该厂的总投资额，两、三年的上交利润即可收回建厂的全部投资。由此可见，认真作好生产准备工作，使新建企业都能按期和提前投入生产和迅速达到设计能力，对于国家社会主义建设，尤其是加速社会主义工业化，具有多么重大的意义。
    但是，由于对生产准备工作的重要性认识和重视不足，有不少新建和扩建企业的生产准备工作作的不够好，结果不是拖延了投入生产的时间，就是在投入生产后经常发生问题。例如哈尔滨电机厂控制开关车间，按计划应于明年开始生产，但是直到最近才派去一名技术人员；绝缘材料厂油漆树脂车间，自一九五三年建成以后，由于缺乏主要设备，至今尚未开始生产；电表仪器厂由于缺少工卡具一百多种，致使开关电表的生产拖迟两个多月，并造成开工后月月完不成计划的不良后果。至于由于原材料供应不能满足生产需要，因而造成停工窝工，则更是一种普遍现象。不少企业由于不能按照本厂的规模、产品特点、工艺路线适时的制订生产组织设计和建立各种生产管理制度，在投入生产后，科室职责不清，互相扯皮，生产秩序混乱，经常出废品，严重地影响了生产任务的完成。应当特别指出，有些工厂在建成之后，由于领导上不能及时确定产品方案与生产任务，生产计划也经常改变，因而影响了有计划地进行生产准备工作和正常的进行生产。哈尔滨锅炉厂原计划于一九五七年建成，为了加速工程进度，提前投入生产，曾在去年进行了紧张地冬季施工，并且将于今年十月间全部建成，但至今还没有确定明年的生产任务。据该厂厂长反映：十四名苏联专家已经到厂半年，因无生产任务，没有工作可作，而到明年三月，有七名专家就要期满回国，这不仅浪费了专家的力量，而且为国家造成了损失。有的工厂也存在着类似的问题。
    产生上述问题的原因，除了因为我国过去工业基础薄弱，技术水平低，缺乏社会主义工业建设经验等客观原因以外，主要是由于思想认识和重视不足造成的。如亚麻厂在建厂时期，就是因为企业领导上存在着“等基本建设完成以后再搞生产准备”的思想，所以就推迟了和没有作好生产准备工作。也正因为对生产准备工作的重要性认识不足，有些新建企业，在建设过程中忽视及时建立和健全生产准备工作的机构，长期不把生产准备工作摆到重要的位置上来，从而阻碍了工业生产的顺利发展。
    所有上述现象，是和市委的领导分不开的。几年来，市委对于新建和扩建企业生产准备工作的领导是很不够的，思想重视不足，缺乏经常的督促和检查，特别是忽视了及时总结这一工作的经验和教训，这是应当进行认真检讨和迅速改正的。
    经验证明，为了切实做好生产准备工作，今后每一个新建企业，在建厂开始的时候，就应当把生产准备工作摆到领导的重要位置上来，必须克服只重视基本建设而忽视生产准备工作的偏向。同时，每一个新建企业，一开始都应当根据总的规划，把土建、安装、生产准备等各方面的工作加以妥善安排，使之互相衔接。必须建立和加强生产准备工作的专管机构，制订生产准备工作的全面规划和具体措施，保证新建企业在投入生产时，在思想上、组织上、计划上、制度上，特别是技术、物质等方面都及时和充分的作好准备，并且要切实搞好与其他有关企业的生产协作。上级部、局也必须在新建企业投入生产之前，提早规定和及时下达生产任务，以免造成工厂虽然建成，但无生产任务，致使国家投资遭致严重浪费的不良现象。
    为了作好生产准备工作，地方和企业党的组织与上级部局，必须加强对生产准备工作的政治思想领导，彻底克服忽视生产准备工作中的各种等待、依赖和片面强调客观困难的错误思想；要经常对企业提出有关生产准备工作的指示和要求，进行严格的督促和检查，及时总结和推广生产准备工作的经验。鉴于许多新建企业，在投入生产时的最大困难之一，往往是缺乏技术力量，对此除应继续依靠旧有企业的大力支援外，还必须进一步加强上级部局和地方党的组织特别是国家和地方劳动部门对各种技术学校的领导，须采取各种办法，大量培养和训练技术工人，增长技术力量。这对于保证新建企业按期投入和正常的进行生产，具有决定意义。在新建企业投入生产后，还须教育和组织全体职工，迅速学会和掌握新技术，为迅速达到设计水平、充分发挥国家投资效能而努力。
