    "Book Donations" and "Inventory"
    Hua Jun
    During the socialist upsurge in the countryside this spring, Shanghai launched a campaign to donate a book to rural youth; in the summer, around "June 1st" Children's Day, another campaign was launched to donate a book to children. Both of these book donation campaigns were quite extensive and thorough. Government offices, organizations, factories, schools, and even streets and alleys in Shanghai were mobilized, truly achieving book donations where books existed, and money contributions where they didn't. Most organized units collected the scattered book funds contributed by individuals, handing them over in a lump sum to the Xinhua Bookstore branches, entrusting them to allocate and donate the books on their behalf. Everyone knew that the Xinhua Bookstore was a state-owned cultural enterprise institution, fully trustworthy. Naturally, after making the payments, no one inquired further: which books were allocated? Which units received them?
    At that time, the Shanghai Xinhua Bookstore did indeed provide a lot of assistance and cooperation for these two book donation campaigns. Not only did they gladly accept the entrustment of various units, but they also sent people with goods or catalogs to the units for selection. The various branches also widely carried out some publicity work (such as posting slogans and posters).
    In principle, these two city-wide book donation campaigns should have established many small libraries for rural youth in the suburbs and children throughout the city, solving their reading problems. However, according to a recent report by a Xinhua News Agency reporter: these donated books are now either piled up in the district cultural sections, piled up in the district libraries, or temporarily stored in various schools... Grassroots cadres are struggling to find a way to deal with them. Why have the books become a burden instead? This is not due to the incompetence of the grassroots cadres. It turns out that the Shanghai Xinhua Bookstore, without anyone realizing it, transformed the city-wide book donation campaign into the store's "sales of inventory" campaign. According to an investigation by a Xinhua News Agency reporter: Gaoqiao Town in the East Suburb District received 1,500 donated books, but there were only two kinds, one with 900 copies and the other with 600 copies; Hongkou District received 30,000 donated books, but less than 300 kinds, averaging about 100 copies of each kind; moreover, some only had the first volume without the second, and some only had the second volume without the first. Some of the children's picture books were outdated stock from the 1954 edition... (See "Liberation Daily" on August 28th). It's simply treating the recipient units as the store's inventory sales outlets!
    In June of this year, I also visited several agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs. I asked them casually if they had received any donated books. They said "yes." When asked where the books were kept, they pointed to some yellowed and mildewed paper packages in the corner of the "entertainment room." When asked why they didn't put them out for everyone to see, they were vague and no longer answered directly. At the time, we did not delve deeper, assuming it was probably due to the busy production schedule and lack of management. Today, the mystery has been revealed!
    The greatest characteristic of a socialist state-owned enterprise is that, in addition to profitability—which should be said to be "accumulating funds for the country"—it must also serve the people wholeheartedly, and must not treat the people with perfunctory or deceptive means. However, in this matter, the Shanghai Xinhua Bookstore has precisely forgotten this point.
    Not long ago, the Shanghai Xinhua Bookstore once adopted a "rationalization proposal" to build a row of large counters between the book buyers and the bookshelves, so that buyers could only access the books through the salespersons. This time, quietly transforming the mass book donation campaign into the store's "sales of inventory" campaign, I wonder if it also came from a "rationalization proposal" of some salespersons; I also wonder if this method was included in the store's "business plan" for the first and second quarters. If this is the direction in which the Shanghai Xinhua Bookstore adopts rationalization proposals and formulates business plans, then it is really worth the store's leaders to think deeply!

    “赠书”与“存货”
    华君
    今年春间，在农村的社会主义高潮中，上海曾经发动过一次赠送农村青年一本书的运动；夏间，在“六·一”儿童节前后，又发动过一次赠送少年儿童一本书的运动。这两次赠书运动都做得相当广泛、深入，上海市内的机关、团体、工厂、学校，乃至街道、里弄，都发动起来了，真正做到了有书赠书，没书出钱。大部分有组织的单位都把各人所出的零星书款收集起来，整笔交给新华书店各门市部，委托他们代配代赠。大家都知道新华书店是国营文化企业机构，完全可以信托，自然，交款之后，也就再没有人去查问：到底配了哪些书？送给了什么单位？
    那时，上海新华书店对这两次赠书运动，也确实做了不少协助、配合的工作，不单欣然接受各单位的委托，还曾派人带货或带书目到各单位去任人选择，各门市部也普遍地做了一些宣传工作（如张贴标语和宣传画）。
    照理，这两次全市性的赠书运动，是应该给近郊农村青年和全市少年儿童建立起不少小图书室，解决他们的读书问题的。可是，最近据新华社记者的报道：这些赠书，现在有的堆在区文化科，有的堆在区图书馆，有的暂时寄存在各学校里……。基层干部正苦于没有办法处理。为什么有了书反而增加了麻烦呢？这并不是由于基层干部的无能，原来是上海新华书店在别人不知不觉之中，把全市性的赠书运动转化成了该店的“推销存货”运动。据新华社记者调查：东郊区高桥镇收到一千五百本赠书，总共只有两种，一种九百本，一种六百本；虹口区收到三万本赠书，但不到三百种，平均每种在一百本上下；而且，有的只有上册，没有下册，有的又只有下册没有上册，有的儿童画册还是1954年版的残货……（见八月二十八日“解放日报”）简直是把受书单位当作该店的存货推销站了！
    今年六月间，我也曾去郊区参观过几个农业生产合作社，顺便问起他们收到过赠书没有？他们说“收到的”。再问他们书放在哪里？他们就指指“文娱室”墙角里一些发黄发霉的纸包。再问他们为什么不摆出来给大家看？他们含糊其词，不再直截答复。当时我们也不便深究，只以为大概是因为生产忙，无人管理的缘故。今天才算揭穿了这个谜！
    社会主义性质的国营企业最大的特点就是除了盈利——应该说是“为国家积累资金”之外，还必须是为人民群众服务的，决不能以敷衍、蒙混的手段来对待人民群众。可是，在这件事上，上海新华书店恰恰忘记了这一点。
    不久以前，上海新华书店还曾一度采用过一个“合理化建议”，在买书者与书柜之间筑起一列大柜台，让买者非通过营业员不能接触到书。这回，将群众性的赠书运动悄悄地转变为该店的“推销存货”运动，不知是否也出于某些营业员的“合理化建议”；也不知这项办法是否订入在该店第一、二季度的“业务计划”内。假如这就是上海新华书店的采纳合理化建议和制订业务计划的方向，那实在值得该店领导者三思！
