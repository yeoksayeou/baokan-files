    Large Hospital to be Built in the Greater Khingan Range
    Xinhua News Agency report: A modern, comprehensive hospital is currently under construction in Yakeshi, the gateway to the Greater Khingan Range forest area.

    Once completed, this hospital will become the central hospital for the Greater Khingan Range forest industry. It will have sixteen departments and offices, ten types of wards, and all kinds of complete equipment.

    Currently, each of the five forest industry bureaus in the Greater Khingan Range has a hospital, but the medical conditions are relatively poor, and more complex conditions cannot be treated.

    After this large central hospital opens at the beginning of next year, sick employees and their families, with the exception of individual serious cases, will be able to receive proper medical treatment locally.

    大兴安岭兴建大型医院
    据新华社讯　在大兴安岭林区的门户牙克石，现在正在兴建一座现代化综合性的医院。
    这所医院建成后，将成为大兴安岭森林工业的中心医院，它设有十六个科、室，十一种病房和各种完善的设备。
    目前大兴安岭的五个森林工业局都各有一座医院，但是医疗条件较差，遇有较复杂的病情便不能治疗。
    明年年初这所大型的中心医院开院后，患病的职工和他们的家属，除个别病情外，都可以在当地得到妥善的医疗。
