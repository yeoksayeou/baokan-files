    Large Trepanning Tool
    The workers Quan Shengshan and Zhang Lianquan of the Advanced Experience Promotion Group of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory have recently manufactured a large trepanning tool from high-speed steel. This trepanning tool can trepan the core of a lathe spindle steel material that is 1.1 meters long, 116 mm in diameter, and weighs 82 kg. In the past, these cores were taken out by crushing them with a turning tool, which wasted a lot of steel material. The cores taken out with this trepanning tool can be used to make a variety of lathe parts, saving a large amount of steel material.
    This large trepanning tool has been used for spindle trepanning of the 9146 pipe cutting machine since September 1.

    大型套料刀
    沈阳第一机床厂先进经验推广组的工人全升山和张连全最近用高速钢制造出一把大型套料刀。这种套料刀能够把长一公尺一、园一一六公厘、重八十二公斤的车床主轴钢料的料心套出。过去这些料心是用车刀车碎取出的，钢料浪费很大，用这种套料刀取出的料心，可以制作多种车床零件，节省大批钢料。
    这把大型套料刀从9月1日起已经开始给9146型切管机的主轴套料。
