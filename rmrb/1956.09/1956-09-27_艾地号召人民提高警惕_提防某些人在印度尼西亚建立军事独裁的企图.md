Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 25th: "People's Daily" reported on the 25th that the General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, D.N. Aidit, warned the people at a mass rally here on the 23rd to be vigilant against attempts by certain individuals to establish a military dictatorship in Indonesia.

Aidit pointed out that these people insist that the people are foolish and not mature enough to practice democracy, therefore they should be subjected to the harsh rule of a general. Recalling that in last year's general election, 80% of the armed forces voted for the Communist Party and other democratic parties, Aidit said that all this provides assurance that any attempt to establish a military dictatorship will be strongly opposed by the Indonesian people.

Aidit said that there is no need to be alarmed by the Soviet-Indonesian joint statement, because the content of the statement is consistent with the government's own program already approved by parliament, and is also in line with the decisions of the Bandung Conference.

    艾地号召人民提高警惕
    提防某些人在印度尼西亚建立军事独裁的企图
    新华社雅加达25日电　“人民日报”25日报道，印度尼西亚共产党总书记迪·努·艾地23日在这里的群众集会上讲话时警告人民提防某些人在印度尼西亚建立军事独裁的企图。
    艾地指出，这些人硬说，人民是愚蠢的，他们还没有成熟得足以实行民主，因此他们应该受一位将军的严酷统治。艾地在追叙在去年的普选中武装部队中的80％的人投共产党和其他民主政党的票时说，这一切提供了保证，建立军事独裁的一切企图将遭到印度尼西亚人民的强烈反对。
    艾地说，对苏联—印度尼西亚联合声明大惊小怪是没有必要的，因为声明的内容和已经由议会批准的政府自己的纲领是一致的，并且也是符合万隆会议的决定的。
