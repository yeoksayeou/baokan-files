Xinhua News Agency, September 27th dispatch from Kuala Lumpur: Malayan political figures have expressed their approval of the Malayan Communist Party's proposals for restoring peace in Malaya, as mentioned in their congratulatory message to the Chinese Communist Party's Eighth National Congress.

    People's Party of Malaya President Burhanuddin said that he agrees with the Malayan Communist Party's statement: "If peace can be restored in Malaya, it will not only be a blessing for the people of all ethnic groups in our country, but also a major contribution to peace in Asia and the world." He called for the reopening of negotiations on restoring peace in Malaya to end the "Emergency."

    Burhanuddin said that as long as both sides are sincere about peace and can adopt a conciliatory attitude, peace in Malaya can certainly be achieved.

    Labour Party of Malaya President Ramanathan said that since the beginning of the "Emergency," the people of Malaya have shed a lot of blood and wasted a lot of wealth. He hopes that the government can consider the Malayan Communist Party's proposal so that the "Emergency" can end as soon as possible.

    Malayan Indian Congress President Sambanthan also made a statement welcoming the Malayan Communist Party's views on restoring peace in Malaya.

    MCA Propaganda Director and Legislative Councilor Tan Siew Sin said, "I think the willingness to welcome international mediation is very good. I suggest inviting some neutral countries such as India and Indonesia to participate in the mediation work."

    马来亚政界领袖赞成马共主张
    要求重开谈判恢复马来亚和平
    据新华社27日讯　吉隆坡消息：马来亚政界人士赞同马来亚共产党在给中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的贺信中提到的关于恢复马来亚和平的主张。
    马来亚人民党主席波伊斯塔曼说，他同意马来亚共产党这种说法：“如果马来亚和平得以恢复，不但是我国各族人民的幸事，而且对亚洲和世界和平也是一个重大的贡献”。他要求重开关于恢复马来亚和平的谈判来结束“紧急状态”。
    波伊斯塔曼说，只要双方对和平都有诚意，而且都能够采取和解的态度，那么，马来亚的和平是一定能实现的。
    马来亚联合邦劳工党主席拉马纳坦说，自从“紧急状态”开始以来，马来亚人民已经流了不少血，也浪费了不少资财，希望政府能够考虑马来亚共产党的建议，使得“紧急状态”早日结束。
    马来亚印度人大会主席桑班坦也发表谈话，欢迎马来亚共产党关于恢复马来亚和平的意见。
    马华公会宣传主任、立法议员陈修信说，我认为欢迎国际调解的意愿是很好的，我建议邀请一些中立国家如印度、印度尼西亚等参加调解工作。
