Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 7th: Sofia dispatch: The proportion of Bulgaria's heavy industry output in the total industrial output has increased from 23% in 1939 before liberation to the current 46%.

In the twelve years since the establishment of the people's government, Bulgaria has successively established and developed a series of new heavy industrial sectors.

Before liberation, Bulgaria only produced more than two million tons of coal annually, but in 1955 it mined more than ten million tons. Calculated by output, the amount of coal mined in the twelve years after liberation is more than that mined in the sixty-five years under the bourgeois regime. Now Bulgaria is one of the countries with the highest coal production in the Balkan Peninsula.

The machine manufacturing industry, which is the heart of heavy industry, produced one hundred and eight times more machines in 1952 than in 1939. Now it can produce more than four hundred kinds of machines that it did not produce in the past, including machine tools, high-pressure and low-pressure steam boilers, transportation equipment, combine harvesters, etc.

The power industry was originally very backward. At the end of World War II, the country's power generation capacity was only 100,000 kilowatts, but by this year the country's power generation capacity has increased to 600,000 kilowatts. Calculated per capita, Bulgaria currently has 330 kilowatt-hours of electricity per person per year, ranking first in the Balkan Peninsula.

The emerging metallurgical and chemical industries are also developing rapidly. Last year, the country's metallurgical industry output had increased more than forty times compared to 1944. By the end of the second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957) next year, the production of pig iron alone will increase fifteen times compared to 1952. At present, the nitrogen fertilizer, sulfuric acid, caustic soda, chemical dyes, and insecticides produced by the chemical industry can already be exported to foreign countries.

In order to continue to vigorously develop heavy industry, the government's investment in heavy industry this year has increased tenfold compared to 1948.

Agriculture Has Been Three-Quarters Cooperativized

Xinhua News Agency, 7th: As Bulgaria's National Day (September 9) approaches, the Bulgarian News Agency reported on the achievements of the socialist transformation of agriculture, saying that the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the country has reached 3,056, which together own 77% of the country's farmers and 75% of the cultivated land. This achievement has created the necessary preconditions for the overall cooperativization of agriculture in two or three years.

Since last autumn, the agricultural cooperativization movement has developed rapidly throughout the country. During this period, 405 new cooperatives were established, including 300,700 farm households and 9.1 million decares (each decare equals 1.5 Chinese mu) of land.

In 1955, the cash income of cooperative planting and animal husbandry was 226 million leva (Bulgarian currency) more than in 1954, and the income of each cooperative member increased by an average of 1,296 leva compared to 1954.

While the agricultural cooperativization movement continues to achieve success, the technical face of agricultural production is also changing rapidly. In 1955, 62.5% of the country's main field work had been mechanized. In some grain-producing areas, the level of mechanization reached more than 80%.

People's Living Standards Continue to Improve

Xinhua News Agency, 7th: According to the Bulgarian News Agency, in the past three years, the living standards of the Bulgarian working people have further improved. In three years, the residents have benefited from several price reductions by more than 3 billion leva (Bulgarian currency). The state has built 1.5 million square meters of housing for urban and rural working people. In addition, the working people have also built about 38,000 private houses with state loans.

In the first three years of the second Five-Year Plan, the state's appropriations for social and cultural facilities reached more than 10 billion leva, and the funds for resident health facilities increased to 30 times that of 1944.

Calculated at constant prices, the average annual salary of workers in 1955 was more than 1,200 leva more than in 1952, an increase of 78.8% compared to 1939, reaching 7,846 leva. (Attached picture)

    人民政权建立十二年来
    保加利亚经济建设成就巨大
    重工业占工业总产值的46％
    新华社布拉格7日电　索非亚消息：保加利亚重工业产值在整个工业总产值中所占的比重，已经从解放前1939年的23％增加到了目前的46％。
    在人民政权建立以来的十二年中，保加利亚相继建立和发展了一系列新的重工业部门。
    解放前，保加利亚每年只生产二百多万吨煤，1955年就开采了一千多万吨。按产量计算，在解放后十二年中所开采的煤，比资产阶级政权下六十五年所开采的还要多。现在保加利亚已经是巴尔干半岛各国产煤量最多的国家之一。
    作为重工业心脏的机器制造业，还在1952年就比1939年多生产了一百零八倍的机器。现在它已能生产四百种以上过去没有生产过的机器，其中包括工作母机、高压和低压蒸汽锅炉、交通运输设备、联合机等。
    电力工业原来非常落后。在第二次世界大战结束的时候，全国的发电能力只有十万瓩，但是到今年全国的发电能力已经增加到六十万瓩。按人口平均计算，目前保加利亚每人每年有三百三十度电，居巴尔干半岛各国的首位。
    新兴的冶金工业和化学工业也在迅速发展中。去年全国冶金工业的产量已经增加到1944年的四十倍以上。到明年第二个五年计划（1953—1957年）结束的时候，单是生铁的产量就将增为1952年的十五倍。目前化学工业生产的氮肥、硫酸、苛性钠、化学染料、杀虫药剂等已经可以向国外出口。
    为了继续大力发展重工业，政府今年用于重工业的投资增加到了1948年的十倍。
    农业已有四分之三合作化
    新华社7日讯　在保加利亚国庆节（9月9日）快要来临的时候，保加利亚通讯社报道农业社会主义改造的成就说，目前全国农业生产合作社的数目已经达到了三千零五十六个，它们共拥有全国77％的农户和75％的耕地。这一成就已经为在两、三年内把农业全盘合作化创造了必要的前提条件。
    从去年秋季以来，全国各地的农业合作化运动发展得很快。在这期间，新成立的合作社达到了四百零五个，这些合作社包括有三十万零七千个农户和九百一十万狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合一市亩半）土地。
    1955年合作社的种植业和畜牧业的现金收入比1954年多两亿二千六百万列弗（保币），每个合作社社员的收入比1954年平均增加了一千二百九十六列弗。
    和农业合作化运动不断取得成就的同时，农业生产的技术面貌也在迅速改变。1955年全国有62.5％的主要田间工作已经机械化了。在某些产谷区，机械化的水平达到了80％以上。
    人民生活水平不断提高
    新华社7日讯　据保加利亚通讯社报道：近三年来保加利亚劳动人民生活水平有了进一步的提高。三年中居民从几次减低物价中得到的好处超过三十亿列弗（保币）。国家为城乡劳动人民建造的住房面积达一百五十万平方公尺。另外，劳动人民还依靠国家贷款建设了大约三万八千幢私人住宅。
    在第二个五年计划的头三年中，国家在社会文化设施方面的拨款达到了一百多亿列弗，用于居民卫生设施方面的经费增加到了1944年的三十倍。
    按不变价格计算，1955年劳动者的平均全年工资比1952年多一千二百多列弗，比1939年增加了78.8％，达到了七千八百四十六列弗。（附图片）
