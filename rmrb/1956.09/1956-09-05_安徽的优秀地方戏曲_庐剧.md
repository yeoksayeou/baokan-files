Xinhua News Agency, Hefei News. Anhui's excellent local opera troupe, Lu Opera, once withered under the oppression of the old society, has now gained honor. In the recent Anhui Province's First Opera Festival, the troupe's performance of the traditional repertoire "Double Silk Ribbon" and the newly written modern drama "Li Huaying" both won the Excellent Performance Award, Music Award, and Director Award; two-thirds of the troupe's actors won first, second, and third-class actor awards at the festival; stage art, orchestra performance, and musicians also won awards.

    The predecessor of the Anhui Lu Opera Troupe was a Hefei Civilian Opera Society with thirty to forty members, famous for performing Lu Opera, which was popular in the area around Hefei (anciently known as Luzhou) and along the banks of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, with a population of ten million. However, during the Kuomintang rule, many of the operas loved by the peasants performed by the "Civilian Opera Society" were often banned, and many actors were persecuted. As a result, many excellent traditional repertoires and beautiful melodies of Lu Opera were lost.

    After liberation, the Anhui Provincial Bureau of Culture, based on the "Civilian Opera Society," expanded the Lu Opera Troupe to more than eighty people and established an orchestra. Over the past few years, the troupe has discovered more than 300 lost repertoires, rehearsed more than 40 operas, and sorted out nearly 40 kinds of beautiful melodies. In 1954, the Lu Opera Troupe's performance of "Borrowing the Luo Yi" at the East China Opera Festival won the Performance Award, and the veteran artist Ding Yulan won the first prize for actors.

    In recent years, the Anhui Lu Opera Troupe has performed in various cities, industrial and mining areas, and rural areas in Anhui. Last year, it performed more than 300 shows.

    The Anhui Lu Opera Troupe has also carried out bold reforms of Lu Opera. In the past, Lu Opera only used锣鼓 (gongs and drums) for accompaniment, and many complex emotions were difficult to express. After research and experimentation by the troupe, it is now possible to determine the arrangement according to the characters in the play, and then use string music and other accompaniment.

    The achievements of the troupe in rehearsing modern dramas in recent years have also broken the view that Lu Opera can only perform historical dramas. In the past year, the dramas "Two Brothers" and "Two Minds," performed by the troupe in coordination with the cooperative movement, have been warmly welcomed by the audience.

    安徽的优秀地方戏曲——庐剧
    新华社合肥讯　一个在旧社会被摧残的奄奄一息的地方戏曲团，现在又获得了荣誉，这就是受群众喜爱的安徽省庐剧团。这个剧团最近在安徽省第一届戏曲观摩演出大会上演出的传统剧目“双丝带”和新编时装剧“李华英”，都获得优秀演出奖、音乐奖和导演奖；剧团三分之二的演员获得了大会一、二、三等演员奖；舞台美术、乐队演奏、乐师也都分别获奖。
    安徽省庐剧团的前身是一个有三、四十人的合肥平民剧社，以演出流行在合肥（古称庐州）周围、江淮两岸一千万人口地区的庐剧而著名。但是在国民党统治时期，“平民剧社”演出的许多为农民热爱的剧目，都常遭禁演，很多演员被迫害。这样，庐剧许多优秀的传统剧目和优美动听的唱腔就失传了。
    解放后，安徽省文化局以“平民剧社”为基础，把庐剧团扩大到八十余人，成立了乐队。几年来，这个剧团已发掘失传剧目三百多个，排演了四十多个剧目，整理出近四十种优美的唱腔。1954年庐剧团在华东戏曲观摩演出大会上演出的“借罗衣”获得大会演出奖，老艺人丁玉兰荣获演员一等奖。
    几年来，安徽省庐剧团在安徽各城市、工矿区、农村演出，去年共演出了三百多场。
    安徽省庐剧团还对庐剧进行了大胆的改革。庐剧过去只用锣鼓伴奏，许多复杂的感情很难表达出来。经过剧团人员的钻研和尝试，现在已能够根据剧中人物的性格确定配曲，再用弦乐等伴奏。
    剧团几年来在排演时装剧所获的成就也打破了认为庐剧只能演古装剧的看法。一年来剧团配合合作化运动演出的“两兄弟”、“两个心眼”等剧，都受到观众们热烈欢迎。
