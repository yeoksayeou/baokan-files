An Overview of Australia
By Australian Writer Noelle Freichild

The attitude of the Australian government does not truly reflect the opinions of the Australian people.

Recently, all three newspapers in Sydney published articles supporting China. Sydney's most influential "Sydney Morning Herald" has called for a realistic attitude towards accepting the People's Republic of China into the United Nations. After publishing the editorial, the newspaper also published a series of articles by its special correspondent, S. Spender, who recently visited China. Even the government-controlled Australian Broadcasting Corporation broadcast comments favorable to China.

The newspapers' recognition of China's status as a major power and its legitimate claim to a seat in the United Nations reflects the growing public friendship towards People's China. It reflects the increasing dissatisfaction with the Australian government's consistent support for the United States in the United Nations and its hostile attitude towards the People's Government of China. It reflects the growing recognition by Australian industry and ranchers that an economic crisis is looming, and that China is a vast market, so it is best to recognize China.

The Australian people love the Chinese people. Australians of Chinese descent, as well as thousands of Chinese people, have been welcomed in the past and are welcomed now.

The large-scale Chinese immigration to Australia took place in the 1850s, during the gold rush. Later, most of them returned to China. But the descendants of those who remained have now become doctors, lawyers, dentists, and teachers. Many have become tycoons in the fruit wholesale industry and other industries, and many have become restaurant owners in the major cities of the Commonwealth.

Only those who have been deeply poisoned by the propaganda of the most reactionary capitalists and religious groups are hostile to China.

The Australian people's growing friendship and the fear of economic crisis among powerful industrialists and ranchers are factors that can influence the government and weaken its support for the US government and the China lobby.

Australia has some unique characteristics. It does not have the small farmer class that is common in most countries. Even its farmers, who are considered "poor" by Australian standards, become wealthy after a few good years.

Unlike China and many European countries, Australia does not have thousands of small shops, blacksmiths, coppersmiths, carpenters, etc.; no peddlers, hawkers, or workshops with only two square meters of space as can be seen in Italy; tradesmen who treat the streets as workshops (a common sight in China) are also absent in Australia.

Australia is a continent, almost the size of China minus Xinjiang, with a population of only nine million. Despite its small population, its industrial situation is similar to that of the United States. Its industry is large-scale. The percentage of small workshops - common in China - is very small. Most of these factories were started by Europeans who fled Nazi rule, and later by anti-democrats who fled when the Soviet Red Army advanced on Berlin.

Australia's main agricultural and pastoral industries have been "industrialized" - so to speak.

When the shearing season comes, workers come from the towns to the large ranches with tens of thousands of sheep.

When the wheat harvest season comes, workers leave the towns to go to the wheat fields of thousands of acres. Harvesting is mechanized.

Cattle and sheep are driven or transported across the continent to huge meat processing plants to be slaughtered.

When sugar beets ripen, another group of workers leaves the cities and pours north into the subtropical beet fields.

The large orchards in the irrigated areas issue a harvest call, and the workers in the towns respond to this call.

Of course, by Australian standards, there are also small farmers and ranchers in Australia.

The strong influence of American foreign policy on Australia and the establishment of branches of American companies in Australia have confused many political observers – including Australian observers.

In fact, if the new capital investment is analyzed, it can be proved that the largest proportion is still Australian capital, followed by British capital, and then American capital.

But there are indeed many Americans in Australia. American companies are major advertisers, and they link politics with their advertising. Americans openly associate with conservative trade unions.

American monopoly capital groups have found strong support among Australian monopoly capital groups. Australian monopoly capital groups fear strong and leading trade unions and consider the United States to be a closer and more reliable ally than Britain.

The main trade unions are led by the Communist Party or a united front. This leadership was won by the working class after years of testing; it was won in secret ballots, in which almost all members voted. The leadership of the Australian trade unions has been subjected to hysterical attacks by the reactionary press, politicians, and religious figures. The conservative government, acting on the will of the monopoly capital groups, has not hesitated to pass laws, appoint judges, and use the police in an attempt to destroy the leadership of the trade unions. In some places they have succeeded.

Although the Australian Communist Party is very strong in the trade union movement, this strength is not reflected in the parliament. In order to explain this difficult-to-understand political phenomenon, it is necessary to touch upon the entire history of the Australian labor movement.

As in some countries in Europe, in Australia, the Social Democratic Party (called the Labor Party in Australia) has become the traditional voting target of the working class.

The Communist Party is now making great efforts to form a united front with ordinary Labor Party members, and there has been considerable progress in this regard, and much greater efforts are still needed in the future.

Although Australia is far from the nerve center of the world, it is more active and widespread in the struggle against atomic and hydrogen bombs than most European countries.

The political position of the Australian working class is becoming clear and firm.

The friendship of the Australian people towards the Chinese people has existed for a long time and is now growing. Australian newspapers and politicians have realized that supporting the United States in opposing China's entry into the United Nations is foolish and futile.

    澳大利亚概况
    澳大利亚作家  诺·佛烈希尔
    澳大利亚政府的态度并不真正反映澳大利亚人民的意见。
    近来悉尼所有的三家报纸都发表了支持中国的文章。悉尼最有影响的“悉尼先驱晨报”曾经要求对接受中华人民共和国进入联合国采取现实的态度。这家报纸在发表社论之后还刊登了它的最近访问过中国的特派记者斯·斯派德的一系列文章。甚至连政府控制的澳大利亚广播公司也播送有利于中国的言论。
    报纸承认中国的大国地位和它对联合国席位的合法要求，反映了愈来愈广泛的公众对人民中国的友谊。它反映了对澳大利亚政府在联合国里一味支持美国、对中国的人民政府抱敌视态度的日益不满。它反映出，澳大利亚的工业界和牧场主日益认识到一个经济危机正在“街角处”跃跃欲出，而中国却是一个广大的市场，最好还是承认中国。
    澳大利亚人民喜爱中国人。中国血统的澳大利亚人以及成千上万的中国人，过去或现在都是受欢迎的。
    中国人大批移民澳洲是在1850年代，即发现大金矿时期。稍后，他们当中大部分人返回中国。但是那些留下来的人的子孙们，如今已经做了医生、律师、牙医、教师。有许多人成了水果批发业和其他行业中的巨富，还有许多人成了这个联邦的各大城镇的餐室老板。
    敌视中国的只有那些深中最反动的资本家和宗教集团的宣传毒害的人。
    澳大利亚人民日益深厚的友情，和有实力的工业家和牧场主对经济危机的恐惧，是可以影响政府和削弱它对美国政府及院外援华集团的支持的因素。
    澳大利亚有一些特点。它没有在大部分国家里所常见的小农阶层。甚至它的农民，按照澳大利亚的说法是“贫穷的”，只要遇上几个好年景，就富裕起来了。
    同中国和许多欧洲国家不一样，澳大利亚没有成千上万的小店铺、铁匠、铜匠、木工等等；没有货郎担，小贩和那些在意大利可以看到的只有两平方公尺地面的作坊；把街道当作作坊的买卖人（这是中国的景象）在澳大利亚也是没有的。
    澳大利亚是一个大陆，几乎等于中国减去了新疆那样大，人口却只有九百万。虽然人口稀少，但是它的工业情况却近似美国。它的工业是大规模的。小型作坊——在中国所惯见的——的百分比很小。这些工厂大部分是由那些逃避纳粹统治的欧洲人所开办的，后来是由那些当苏联红军向柏林挺进时逃出来的反民主分子开办的。
    澳大利亚的主要农牧业已经“工业化了”——似乎可以这样说。
    剪羊毛的季节来临时，工人从城镇来到拥有成千上万头羊的大牧场。
    收割麦子的季节来临时，工人们离开城镇到那地连千亩的种麦场去。收割是机械化的。
    牛羊被驱赶或用车辆载着横过大陆，到巨大的肉类加工厂里被宰杀。
    甜菜成熟时，又一批工人离开了城市向北涌入亚热带的甜菜田。
    灌溉区的大果园发出了收获的召唤，城镇的工人又来响应这个召唤。
    当然，按照澳洲的标准说，澳大利亚也有小农和小牧场主。
    美国对澳大利亚的外交政策的有力影响和美国企业在澳大利亚设立分支机构，迷惑了许多政治观察家——连澳大利亚的观察家也不例外。
    其实，如果对新的资本投资进行分析，就可以证明其中比重最大的还是澳大利亚的资本，英国的资本次之，美国又次之。
    但是在澳大利亚的美国人的确不少。美国企业是大广告主顾，他们把政治同他们的广告联结起来。美国人跟保守的工会公开来往。
    美国在澳大利亚的垄断资本集团当中找到了有力的支持。澳大利亚垄断资本集团害怕强大的和有领导的工会，并认为美国比英国是更亲近可靠的盟友。
    主要的工会都是由共产党或联合阵线领导的。这个领导权是工人阶级经过多年考验后才赢得的；是在秘密投票中赢得的，在秘密投票中几乎全体会员都投了票。澳大利亚工会的领导遭到反动的报刊、政客和宗教分子的歇斯底里的攻击。保守党政府，秉承垄断资本集团的意旨，毫不犹豫地通过法案，任命法官、动用警察，企图摧毁工会的领导。有的地方他们得逞了。
    澳大利亚共产党虽然在工会运动中很有力量，但这个力量并未反映到议会里来。要想说明这种使人不易了解的政治现象，必然要触及澳大利亚的全部工人运动史。
    正如欧洲的某些国家一样，在澳大利亚，社会民主党（在澳大利亚称工党）成了工人阶级的传统的投票对象。
    共产党现在正在进行巨大的努力，争取跟普通的工党党员结成统一战线，在这方面已有不少进展，今后仍须大大努力。
    虽然澳大利亚远离世界的神经中枢，但是在反对原子弹和氢弹的斗争中，比大部分欧洲国家来得更积极和普遍。
    澳洲的工人阶级的政治立场正在明确和坚定起来。
    澳洲人民对中国人民的友谊，过去早就有了，现在正在增进。澳大利亚的报纸和政界人士已经认识到，支持美国反对中国进入联合国，是愚蠢而又徒劳的。
