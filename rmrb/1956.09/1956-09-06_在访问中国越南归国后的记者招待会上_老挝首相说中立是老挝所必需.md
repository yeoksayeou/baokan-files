Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 5th: Vientiane dispatch: Lao Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma said yesterday that Laos' political line is located between the Eastern and Western blocs.

Phouma, who had just returned from visits to China and Vietnam, held his first press conference in Vientiane yesterday after returning home. He said, "We favor the complete neutrality taken by Switzerland. Neutrality is an indispensable necessity for us."

"We have long-standing friendly relations with distant countries like France, the United States, and Great Britain, but what result will we have if our relations with neighboring countries are not good?"

"We only ask others to respect our ideology. We have asked Beijing and Hanoi to do so, and they are very understanding."

Phouma said that he brought back an impression from his visit: that China wants "peace and tranquility, which it needs for national construction."

He said that Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai "once told me that he would be very happy if the Americans invited the Chinese to the United States, and if the Americans accepted an invitation to visit China."

Phouma said that Laos would accept aid from any country if such aid was not attached with conditions.

As for American aid, Phouma said: "This aid must be changed, namely reducing military aid to increase economic aid."

    在访问中国越南归国后的记者招待会上
    老挝首相说中立是老挝所必需
    新华社河内5日电　万象消息：老挝首相梭发那·富马昨天说，老挝的政治路线位于东方集团和西方集团之间。
    富马刚从中国和越南访问回来，他昨天在万象举行了回国后的第一次记者招待会。他说，我们赞成瑞士所采取的那种完全的中立。中立是我们不可缺少的必需品。
    我们同像法国、美国和英国这些遥远的国家有着悠长的友好关系，但是如果我们同邻近的国家关系不好，那么我们会有什么结果呢？
    “我们只是要求别人尊重我们的意识形态。我们已经要求北京和河内这样做，它们非常谅解”。
    富马说，他访问后带回了一个印象，那就是：中国希望“和平和安宁，这是它为了建设国家所需要的”。
    他说，中国总理周恩来“曾经对我说，如果美国人邀请中国人去美国，如果美国人接受访问中国的邀请，那么他将感到非常高兴”。
    富马说，老挝将接受任何国家的援助，如果提供这种援助时不附加条件的话。
    至于美国人的援助，富马说：“这种援助必须改变，即减少军事援助来增加经济援助”。
