Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 2nd - The Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction General Company's Earthwork Engineering Company has seriously damaged construction machinery due to its one-sided pursuit of construction progress.

This engineering company, which is responsible for the mechanized construction of earthwork projects for Anshan Iron and Steel, owns nearly two hundred heavy construction machines, including excavators, bulldozers, scraper-loaders, and trucks. However, from January to July this year, the utilization rate of all machinery reached only 43%, while 57% of the machinery could not work due to frequent malfunctions. The utilization rate of trucks was even lower; out of ninety-two trucks in good condition, only thirty-five could work on average each month.

Because the machinery utilization rate was very low, the state stipulated that this company should complete 783,000 cubic meters of earthwork in the first half of the year, but they only completed 577,000 cubic meters. In addition, the state stipulated that 60% of Anshan's earthwork projects in the first half of this year should be completed by machinery, but this company only achieved 28.9%.

The main reason for the low machinery utilization rate is that the leading cadres of this engineering company only cared about the one-sided pursuit of construction progress and seriously neglected the regular maintenance of the machinery. According to workers' revelations, the leaders here often made them work with "sick" machines. For example, the driver of truck No. 42, when he heard an abnormal noise from the differential gear of the truck he was driving, asked to stop for inspection and repair, but the leading cadres said, "Just keep going, it's okay!" As a result, after only transporting one more load of earth, a differential gear worth 800 yuan was broken. Four of the eight rear axle screws on truck No. 81 were already broken, and the driver's request for repair was rejected by the cadres on the grounds that "completing the task is the most important thing"; later, because two out of three excavators were broken and there were enough trucks to transport the earth, this truck was approved for repair.

Due to the one-sided pursuit of construction progress, they not only did not inspect and maintain the machinery before and after each shift every day, but also cancelled the statutory time of one to two days per month for machinery maintenance stipulated by the state. In July, the chief mechanic randomly checked the maintenance status of twenty trucks, three excavators, and two bulldozers, and found that the air filters of sixteen of the twenty trucks contained thick layers of dust and sand; one truck's air filter actually contained more than four pounds of dust and sand. The oil filters of nine trucks could not be turned due to mud and sand accumulation or broken handles. The air and oil filtration devices of excavators and bulldozers were also very poorly maintained. According to engineering and technical personnel, these machines have had their service life shortened just because the air and oil filtration devices were not well maintained.

Due to lack of maintenance, the number of major mechanical accidents has increased every month since the beginning of this year. The number of accidents in July increased more than twofold compared to January, and major accidents of the same nature have repeatedly and continuously occurred. Among the 113 major accidents that occurred from January to July, 35 involved broken differential gears. Due to the lack of machinery maintenance and the high number of accidents, the efficiency of the machinery was seriously affected. In the first half of the year, excavators alone dug 40,000 cubic meters less earth due to accidents.

After discovering the above serious situation during an inspection, this company has been trying to improve since mid-August.

### 鞍山一土方工程公司片面追求进度  严重地损害了施工机械

    鞍山一土方工程公司片面追求进度
    严重地损害了施工机械
    新华社鞍山2日电　鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司土方工程公司由于片面追求施工进度，严重地损害了施工机械。
    这个担负着鞍钢土方工程机械化施工的工程公司，共拥有挖土机、推土机、铲运机、汽车等将近二百台重型施工机械。可是在今年1至7月份，全部机械的利用率只达到43％，而57％的机械因为经常发生毛病不能工作。其中汽车的利用率更低，九十二辆处于良好状态的汽车，每月平均能工作的只有三十五辆。
    因为机械利用率很低，国家规定这个公司上半年应该完成七十八万三千公方土方的任务，他们只完成了五十七万七千公方。此外，国家规定鞍山今年上半年的土方工程，应该有60％由机械去完成，而这个公司只达到了28.9％。
    机械利用很低的主要原因，是这个工程公司的领导干部只顾片面追求施工进度，严重地忽视了对机械的经常性的维护保养工作。据工人揭发，这里的领导干部经常让他们开着“带病”的机械去工作。例如四十二号汽车的司机，在听到他驾驶的汽车的牙包发出不正常的响声的时候，曾经要求停车检修一下，可是领导干部却说：“干吧，没有关系！”结果，只是多运了一车土，就把一个价值八百元的牙包打坏了。八十一号汽车的八个后轴螺丝已经断了四个，司机要求去修理，也被干部以“完成任务要紧”为理由拒绝了；后来因为三台挖土机坏了两台，运土的汽车够用了，这台汽车才被批准去修理。
    由于片面地追求施工进度，他们不仅没有在每天的班前班后对机械实行检查和保养，而且把国家规定的每个月要有一天到两天保养机械的法定时间也给取消了。7月份，总机械师抽查了二十辆汽车、三台挖土机和两台推土机的保养情况，发现在二十辆汽车中就有十六辆的空气滤清器里积有很厚的灰砂；有一辆汽车的空气滤清器里竟有四斤多灰砂。有九辆汽车的机油过滤器，因为泥砂淤积或把手损坏，而不能转动了。挖土机、推土机的空气和机油的过滤装置，也保养得很坏。据工程技术人员说，这些机械单是由于对空气和机油过滤装置维护得不好，就已经缩短了使用寿命。
    由于不维护机械，今年以来发生的重大机械事故，月月都有增加。7月份发生的事故较1月份增加了两倍多，并且同样性质的重大事故一再重复、连续地发生。在1至7月份发生的一百一十三件重大事故中，打坏牙包的共有三十五件。由于不维护机械，事故多，严重地影响了机械效能的发挥。上半年，单是挖土机一种机械，就因为发生事故少挖了四万公方的土。
    这个公司检查发觉了上面的严重情况以后，从8月中旬开始，已经在设法改进。
