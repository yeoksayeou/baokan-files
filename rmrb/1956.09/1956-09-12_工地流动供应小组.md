    Mobile Supply Team at the Construction Site
    Li Huaqiong
    Three kilometers from Baotou, there is a place called "Mao Fengzhang Yingzi," where tens of thousands of railway workers labor day and night. Although it is very close to the city, it is a wilderness without a single shop or even a peddler. If the workers want to buy something, they have to take a trip to the city. What a troublesome thing this is!
    To solve this problem, the supply department of the Railway Engineering Bureau established a mobile supply team. Every day, the team members fill a cart with all kinds of goods that the workers love to eat, such as candies, food, soap, toothbrushes and toothpaste, towels, shoes and socks, cigarettes, and white liquor, and push it to the construction site. When the workers are resting, many people crowd around the mobile supply cart, buying this and that; a cart full of goods is sold out in no time.
    The railway supply department also adopted a method of cross-mobile supply between work areas, so that the various different commodities carried by the salespeople could be mutually adjusted. What if the salesperson doesn't bring what the worker needs, or if the supply station doesn't have it? They use "appointment order forms" to deliver goods to their door on time. The salespeople who participated in the mobile supply traveled back and forth 1,496 kilometers in the first quarter of this year.
    When the Jining-Erenhot Railway was built in 1955, there was no mobile supply team; every day, a long snake line formed in front of the supply station. There were children, old people, and housewives holding children. Some people brought small stools to sit on, and also brought needlework with them, regardless of the wind, sand, scorching sun, and freezing cold days; the line waiting to buy things often stood for three or four hours. The salespeople were busy sweating all day long, and were prone to making mistakes in the rush. Now, the supply team travels around selling goods, customers don't line up, and salespeople aren't rushed, which is truly a win-win situation. (Attached picture)

    工地流动供应小组
    李华琼
    离包头三公里有个地方叫“毛凤章营子”，有成千上万的铁路工人在这里日日夜夜地劳动着。这里离城市虽然很近，但是一片原野，没有一个商店，也找不着一个小贩。工人们想买点东西，必须进城走一趟。这是多么麻烦的事！
    铁路工程局的供应部门，为了解决这个问题，成立了流动供应小组。组员们每天把职工们爱吃的糖果、食品、肥皂、牙刷牙膏、毛巾、鞋袜、香烟、白干酒等各色各样的物品，装满满一车，推到工地上。工人休息的时候，许多人挤在流动供应车的周围，你买这，他买那；一车子东西，没有多长时间就卖完了。
    铁路供应部门还采取了工区和工区之间交叉流动供应的方法，使售货员携带的各种不同商品，可以互相调剂。职工需要的东西售货员没有带去，或者供应站没有的话怎么办呢？他们采用“预约订货表”，按时送货上门。参加流动供应的售货员们，在今年第一季度中就往返流动了一千四百九十六公里。
    1955年修建集二铁路的时候，流动供应小组没有建立；每天，在供应站门前排着长蛇阵。这里有小孩、老人、抱着孩子的主妇。有人带着小凳子来坐，手里还带着针线活，不管风沙烈日和结冰的严寒日子，等着买东西的队伍往往一站就是三四个钟头。售货员整天忙得满头大汗，忙乱中还容易出错。如今供应组巡回售货，顾客不排队，售货员不忙乱，真是一举两得。（附图片）
