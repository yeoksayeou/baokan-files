Thinking of a Half-Day Trip to Mount Baiyue
Chen Jueren

    After reading Tang Xianzu's "Four Dreams of Yuming Hall," I specifically re-read the "Poetry Collection of Yuming Hall." I happened to see a five-character quatrain titled: "Wu Xu Pities My Lack of Leisure and Encourages Me to Travel to Huangshan and Baiyue, Which Did Not Come to Pass." The poem goes: "To know the aura of gold and silver, one often travels to Huang and Bai. The place of my life's deepest obsession, never dreamed of reaching Huizhou." Tang Xianzu's little poem was clearly written with a purpose, satirizing certain corrupt officials. But Huangshan and Baiyue were implicated, and the people of Huizhou were implicated as well, unfairly accused. Those who do not understand the background at the time must scold Tang Xianzu as a "meddling busybody." What connection do gold, silver, Huangshan, and Baiyue have? Just because of the coincidence of the words "Huang" and "Bai," to insult Huangshan and Baiyue as also having bourgeois ideology is probably not very fair. But writing poetry is, after all, writing poetry, and we don't need to get so angry for Huangshan, Baiyue, and the people of Huizhou.
    Some time ago, I heard a literary critic chatting, and he was very dissatisfied with Ye Shengtao's travelogues of Huangshan, saying that they had no educational significance, no ideological content, and were divorced from reality, and so on. Although this critic did not label Mr. Ye with bourgeois ideology, nor did he say something like "never dreamed of reaching Huizhou" like Tang Xianzu, he was a "progressive thinker" who opposed writing landscape travelogues. This can probably be determined. But I sincerely want to ask such critics to relax their standards a bit and allow writers to come up with more variety. But in order to make writing more diverse and expand the scope of articles, what's wrong with writing some landscape essays!
    I have not been to Huangshan, although I heard that there are already many guesthouses, sanatoriums, and convalescent homes there. Recently, comrades living in the south went there and sent back some landscape photos, all of which are very lovely. In today's world, where feudal society and capitalist society have both collapsed, there is certainly no "aura of gold and silver" as Tang Xianzu said. Writing about scenery is not necessarily a feudal scholar-official habit. I might as well boldly pick up my pen and write a few lines about a famous mountain that I once briefly visited—Mount Baiyue.
    The fame of Mount Baiyue is certainly not as great as that of Huangshan, but it has been mentioned alongside Huangshan since ancient times. This can be seen from Tang Xianzu's poem title. Huangshan and Baiyue are far apart, and tourists often cannot visit both at the same time. In the future, when transportation is more convenient, it will naturally be possible to visit Huangshan in the morning and Baiyue in the evening, but currently there are still restrictions. Visiting Huangshan means you cannot visit Baiyue, and visiting Baiyue means you cannot visit Huangshan. Huangshan is one hundred and twenty li north of Shexian County, located between Yixian County and Taiping County, while Baiyue is exclusively occupied by Xiuning County. Baiyue is located in the western countryside of Xiuning, about thirty li from the county seat. According to the local chronicles, the surrounding area is more than thirty-five li. The people of Huizhou do not call it Baiyue, but call it Qiyun Mountain. Before liberation, the so-called "Qiyun Pilgrimage" was the most popular thing in the countryside. Today, farmers' awareness has increased, and they have broken with superstition, so the matter of pilgrimage has become less common. In fact, the so-called Qiyun Mountain is named after Qiyun Rock. There is a Taoist temple in front of Qiyun Rock, so the locals use Qiyun instead of Baiyue. The general name should be Baiyue and not Qiyun.
    The long-distance bus passes through the foot of Mount Baiyue, and the station is called "Yanjiao" (Rock Foot). Get off at Yanjiao, walk across a large stone bridge, and climb up the mountain. Facing you, a towering stone monument is engraved with the four characters "Qiyun Wonderland." The stone road winds around, passing through "Peach Blossom Cave," "Peach Blossom Stream," and "Blessed Land," none of which are novel. Walking up to "First Heaven Gate," one cannot help but be amazed. First, a large stone fissure, square and upright, naturally forming a pass, as if arriving at Jian閣 in Sichuan. The gate is very deep, overlooking a bottomless cliff. Behind it, however, it suddenly opens up, with stone walls encircling it like a city wall, surrounding a long, large circle. The stone color is dark and mottled, but also so steep and neat. The ancient city of Pompeii in Rome probably does not have the strangeness of this natural boundary. These many rocks are named "Amitabha Rock," "Arhat Rock," "Dragon King Rock," "Guanyin Rock"...etc. In front of the so-called "Dragon King Rock," a waterfall falls, fine and vertical, like a silk curtain, called Pearl Curtain. In front of the curtain is a clear pool, called碧莲池 (Green Lotus Pond). It is said that this waterfall and pool never dry up and remain this way all year round. Many poems are carved on the rocks, including a long poem by Yuan Mei, in which there are a few sentences like this: "...But surprised at the Pearl Curtain, hanging down thousands of lines. Sitting for a short time, the weather changes again. ..." The weather in the mountains is suddenly cloudy and sunny, changing very quickly. The cloud gas that makes rain fills the mountains, just as Yuan Mei described.
    Second Heaven Gate and Third Heaven Gate, although they also have cliffs and giant rocks, are far less interesting than First Heaven Gate. Further up, there is a small street with food vendors and variety shops selling wooden swords and toys, bamboo baskets, etc. There are many Taoist temples and incense rooms on the street, which used to be for pilgrims who came to worship the mountain. If they are converted into workers' sanatoriums, convalescent homes, and forest management offices, it would be very suitable.
    The main hall is called Zhenwu Temple. Behind the temple, a mountain rises abruptly, like a screen against the sky, which is the so-called Qiyun Rock. In front of Qiyun Rock, five peaks stand tall, some called Stone Drum, some called Stone Bell. Directly opposite the temple gate is Incense Burner Peak, standing out from the vastness, not connected to the surrounding mountains. There are iron incense burners and iron pavilions on top. The thick and long iron chains hanging down from the mountain can be tightly held to climb up Incense Burner Peak (if someone performs here at this time, it would be a wonderful program).
    Beyond this, there are also Purple Heaven Rock, Three Sisters Peak, Five Ding Peak, Five Old Men Peak, as well as Fang La Village, Qixia Cave, and many other scenic spots. Unfortunately, due to work, I was in a hurry to go down the mountain and could not visit them one by one.
    Mount Baiyue gave me a very good impression. In just half a day, it wasn't even "a fleeting glimpse." I hope to have the opportunity to linger there for three or five days again. Of course, I also hope to go to Huangshan and see the sea of clouds. My thoughts are completely opposite to Tang Xianzu's. I often "dream of going to Huizhou." I am definitely not going to "travel to Huang and Bai" in order to "know the aura of gold and silver," and I don't think I will be misunderstood again. The old social system of Tang Xianzu's era has already completely collapsed, and at the same time, the titles of "Huizhou Shroff" and "Monk-Merchant" of the people of Huizhou will gradually be removed completely. Let Huangshan and Baiyue return to their original pure appearance and return to the embrace of the working people.

    想起了白岳半日游
    陈玨人
    读了汤显祖的玉茗堂四梦，特地再翻翻玉茗堂诗集。偶然看到五言绝句中有一个题目是：“吴序怜余乏绝劝为黄山白岳之游不果”。诗是这样的：“欲识金银气，多从黄白游。一生痴绝处，无梦到徽州”。汤显祖这首小诗，显然是有所为而发，讽刺某些贪污官僚的。但黄山白岳却倒了楣，徽州人也倒了楣，蒙上不白之冤了，不明了当时背景的人读起来一定要骂汤显祖是“缠夹二先生”了，黄金白银和黄山白岳有什么关连呢？只为了黄白二字字面上的偶合，就污辱黄山白岳也有资产阶级思想，这怕不很公道吧。但写诗终于是写诗，我们正不必为黄山白岳和徽州人生那末大的气。
    前些时曾听到一位文艺批评家闲谈，他很不满意于叶圣陶先生写黄山游记那样的文章，说是没有教育意义，没有思想性，脱离现实云云。这位批评家虽然不曾给叶先生扣上资产阶级思想的帽子，也并没有像汤显祖那样说什么“无梦到徽州”，但他是反对写山水游记文章的“进步思想家”，这大约是可以断定的了。但我却十分诚恳地想请求这样的批评家们放宽一点尺度，让写文章的人多出一点花样吧。但为了使写作多样性一些，文章范围扩大些，写点山水小品，又有什么罪过呢！
    黄山我没有到过，虽然听说那儿已经设有不少招待所、休养所、疗养院，最近住在南方的同志去过那里，寄来一些风景照片，都是很可爱的。在封建社会、资本主义社会都垮了台的今天，当然没有汤显祖所说的什么“金银气”了。写写风景，也未必就是封建士大夫习气。我何妨放胆提笔写几行关于我所曾匆匆到过一下的名山——白岳。
    白岳的名气，当然不及黄山那末大，可是它从古以来就是和黄山并称的。这只要看汤显祖的诗题就可以知道。黄山和白岳的距离很远，游山的人往往不能同时去游。将来交通更方便了，朝黄山而暮白岳，这自然也是可能的事，但目前还有限制，游黄山就不能游白岳，游白岳就不能游黄山。黄山在歙县北百二十里，介于黟县和太平县之间，白岳则为休宁县所独占。白岳在休宁西乡，距县城约三十里，周围面积，据志书上说在三十五里以上。徽州人口头上不叫白岳，叫它为齐云山，解放前所谓“齐云进香”，是农村中最为盛行的事，今天农民觉悟提高了，破除了迷信，朝山进香的事也就少起来了。其实所谓齐云山是以齐云岩而得名，齐云岩前有道教的庙，所以当地人以齐云代替白岳，总的名称应该是白岳而并不是齐云。
    长途汽车经过白岳山麓，站名叫“岩脚”。由岩脚下车，走过一座大石桥，向山上爬，迎面高耸着的石碑刻“齐云仙境”四大字。石路盘旋，经过“桃源洞”“桃花涧”“洞天福地”，都没有什么新奇。再上走到“一天门”，就不能不使人惊奇叫绝了。先是一大石罅，方方正正的，天生就一座关隘似的，仿佛到了四川的剑阁，门洞甚深，下临万丈悬崖。后面却又豁然开朗，石壁回环，和城墙一般，绕了长长一个大圈子，石色苍黝斑驳，却又那么陡峭整齐。罗马的邦贝古城，恐怕也没有这个天生成的境界的古怪。这许多岩石分名为“弥陀岩”“罗汉岩”“龙王岩”“观音岩”……等。那所谓“龙王岩”的前面，飞泉洒落，细密垂直，有如匹练，名叫珍珠帘。帘的前面有一清池，叫碧莲池。这一道飞泉和一泓池水，据说从不干涸，一年四季都是这样的。岩石上刻诗很多，有袁枚长诗一首，其中有几句是这样的：“……但讶珍珠帘，挂落千条线。趺坐未片时，阴晴状又变。……”山中忽阴忽晴，变化很快，作雨的云气，满山蒸郁，的确和袁枚所形容的一般。
    二天门，三天门，虽然也有峭壁巨石，但远不如一天门那么有趣了。再上去，有一条小街，有卖饮食的，也有杂耍店，卖木制刀剑玩具和竹篾提篮等。街上的道院香房很多，过去是给朝山进香的香客们住的，如果把它改为工人休养所、疗养院和山林管理处，那到是很适宜的。
    正殿叫真武观，观后一山突起，如屏倚天，即所谓齐云岩。齐云岩前面，五峰矗立，有叫石鼓的，有叫石钟的。和观门正相对的叫香炉峰，挺然拔出苍莽中，不和群山相连属。上面有铁香炉和铁亭，从山上一直垂下的又粗又长的铁链，可紧紧拉着它爬上香炉峰（假如有人在此时表演一番，那倒是精采的节目）。
    过此还有紫霄岩、三姑、五丁、五老诸峰，以及方腊寨、栖霞洞许多胜迹，可惜我因为工作关系要急于赶下山，不能一一去游览了。
    白岳给我的印象非常好，仅仅半天工夫，真是连“走马看花”也谈不上。希望有机会再去盘桓三五天，当然我更希望也能去上黄山，看看云海。我和汤显祖的想法是完全相反的，我是常“有梦到徽州”的。我决不是为了要“识金银气”才想去“从黄白游”，这一点想不会再为人们所误会。汤显祖那个时代的旧社会制度，早已完全垮了台，同时徽州人的“徽州朝奉”“市僧”等头衔也要渐渐地被卸除净尽了。让黄山白岳还它本来清白的面目回到劳动人民的怀抱中来吧。
