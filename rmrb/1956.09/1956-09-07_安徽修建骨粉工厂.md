    Anhui is building a large-scale bone meal factory. By August 31, the foundation work of most of the factory buildings, covering a construction area of 12,000 square meters, had been completed.
    This factory will be completed next year. After completion, it can produce 3,224 tons of bone meal annually to supply Anhui farmers as fertilizer. The factory will also produce 2.79 tons of bone glue and 0.55 tons of bone oil by-products every day. Bone glue can be exported, and bone oil can be used as soap raw material. The newly built granular fertilizer workshop can also produce 3,650 tons of granular fertilizer annually.
    The production process and in-plant transportation of this factory are all mechanically operated, which can greatly reduce workers' physical labor, and the production cost of bone meal will also be reduced by 12% compared with the Qingdao Bone Meal Factory.

    安徽修建骨粉工厂
    本报讯　安徽省正在建设一座规模较大的骨粉工厂。到8月31日，在一万二千平方公尺建筑面积上，大部厂房基础工程已经完工。
    这个厂在明年就可建成。建成后每年可生产三千二百二十四吨骨粉，供给安徽农民作肥料。这个工厂每天还将生产出二点七九吨骨胶和零点五五吨骨油的副产品，骨胶可以出口，骨油作肥皂原料。随厂新建的颗粒肥料车间，每年也能生产三千六百五十吨颗粒肥料。
    这座工厂生产过程和厂内运输过程都用机械操作，工人体力劳动可大大减轻，骨粉生产成本也将比青岛骨粉厂降低12％。
