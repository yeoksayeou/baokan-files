    Producing Activity Furniture
    Currently, the homes of many workers are not spacious enough to accommodate various types of furniture. If there is a bed, there is no room for a table; if there is a table, there is no room for chairs and cabinets; larger furniture is out of the question. Therefore, it is suggested that the woodworking production departments design and manufacture more useful or foldable activity furniture to meet the needs of the broad masses of workers. 　Zhang Qingming

    生产活动家具
    目前许多职工住的房屋都不够宽敞，不可能放置各种类型的家具。放了床、不能放桌子；放了桌子就放不下椅子和柜子；其它较大的家具更不用说。因此，建议木器生产部门多设计和制造一些能够用的或者可以折叠的活动家具，以适应广大职工的需要。　张清明
