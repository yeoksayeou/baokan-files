    A Party Branch Secretary Who is Good at Listening to the Opinions of the Masses
    Duan Xianping
    Comrade Yu Degen, the Party Branch Secretary of Taishan Township, Anyi County, Jiangxi Province, is a good cadre who can go deep among the masses and maintain close ties with them. I worked in Taishan Township twice, and every time I talked to the masses about Comrade Yu Degen, they praised him for being enthusiastic, capable, and caring about everyone's hardships. Therefore, he has received commendations five times in the past two years.
    Because Comrade Yu Degen personally experienced a life of hunger and cold before liberation, he deeply understands the hardships of the peasants. Therefore, after becoming a township cadre, he is good at listening to the opinions and demands of the masses. In terms of methods, on the one hand, he focuses on cadres' reports. He believes that this provides a relatively comprehensive view of the situation from all aspects. At several reporting meetings, I saw him listening quietly to everyone's speeches and taking detailed notes, even marking the opinions and demands of the masses. On the other hand, he personally goes down to the grassroots, taking advantage of the opportunities when the masses gather around the stove for casual chats in winter or enjoy the cool air in front of their houses in summer, to start conversations with the masses about ordinary matters, until they express their opinions and demands. He believes that this is a more profound and specific way to understand the situation. After understanding the opinions and demands of the masses, especially after discovering common problems, he discusses them with several full-time cadres in the township, and according to different situations, convenes Party branch committees, general meetings of Party members, cadre meetings, or township people's representative conferences, relying on everyone's wisdom to jointly study and analyze, clarifying which opinions and demands of the masses are correct, which are incorrect, which are individual problems, and which are common problems, and then decides on solutions. Correct opinions and demands are resolved as soon as possible; incorrect opinions and demands are patiently explained, and the reasons are given; common problems are resolved by mobilizing all cadres; individual problems are personally handled or assigned to cadres to solve. For example, at the beginning of this year's spring plowing production, both cadres and the masses had relatively serious right-leaning conservative ideas. When the Party branch proposed to increase production to 575 jin per mu on the basis of last year's average of 303 jin per mu, the masses responded: "Cooperativization can be accelerated, but grain production can only be increased slowly," and "Unless you bring in tractors and apply fertilizer to all the fields." An old farmer in Taishan Cooperative even joked to the cadres: "You are dreaming of eating swan meat!" At that time, Comrade Yu Degen was still working in the original Taishan Township. After collecting these reflections, he believed it was a serious problem, so he and the cooperative cadres of the Yong'an Team of Taishan Cooperative studied it several times and found the reasons for the problem: the cooperative members did not have a sufficient understanding of the favorable conditions brought by the upsurge of cooperativization for the development of production and viewed the new situation with old eyes. Therefore, Comrade Yu Degen suggested that the Party branch launch a publicity campaign among the masses based on the "Propaganda Speech on Spring Plowing Production" compiled by the Prefectural Party Committee Propaganda Department, focusing on explaining the favorable conditions for production this year and also pointing out the difficulties; and suggested launching a "movement to put forward rationalization proposals" among the cooperative members. After the masses were mobilized, within ten days, the cooperative members put forward 52 rationalization proposals, which were summarized into ten measures to increase production throughout the year. For the suggestion of cooperative member Yu Lichun to make granular fertilizer by himself, because the newly established cooperative had insufficient funds and could not implement it temporarily, Comrade Yu Degen also made an individual explanation to him. Therefore, he said with satisfaction: "The cadres think very carefully about the problems, and the answers are very timely." Later, many problems continued to arise in the production movement, such as the shortage of draught cattle, the imperfect organization of labor, the excessively low base scores for women, the lack of pocket money for cooperative members, and the shortage of labor for summer harvesting and planting. Comrade Yu Degen closely relied on all the cadres and the broad masses to solve them in a timely manner. Each time a problem was solved or a cooperative member's request was met, the masses' enthusiasm for production increased. In the summer harvesting and planting movement, after adopting the method of piecework payment and correcting the phenomenon of excessively low base scores for women, the attendance rate of women reached 100%. This year, Taishan Cooperative's early rice production increased by 25.8% compared to last year. Last year, there were only 1,735 mu of double-cropping rice, but this year, in the face of severe drought, 2,820 mu of double-cropping rice were planted, and it is estimated that the annual production can be increased by 70%. Cooperative members reflected: "This is due to the good leadership of the Party branch, and Comrade Yu also deserves credit."
    Comrade Yu Degen not only attaches importance to leading production and paying attention to solving the difficulties of cooperative members in production, but also pays attention to caring for the lives of the masses. Whenever the masses raise difficulties in their lives, he always tries to think from their perspective: "What would I do if I were him?" Then the motivation to help the masses solve their problems comes. During the summer harvest and planting season, the tasks were very heavy, and the weather was unusually hot, and 180 cooperative members in the township fell ill. After learning about this problem, he first found cadres to analyze the causes of the illness, which were mainly: some took cold showers after labor; everyone drank cold water; some engaged in labor at noon, and the weather was too hot for their bodies to bear; and some slept in the open air and caught a cold in the middle of the night when it turned cold. Then, he found the cooperative committee of Taishan Cooperative to study solutions: ? Advocate starting early and working late, allowing cooperative members to have sufficient rest time at noon; ? Appoint a special person to boil tea and prohibit drinking cold water; ? After 10 o'clock in the evening, cadres are assigned to urge cooperative members to go to bed; ? The cooperative purchases some Rendan, Ten Drops Water, etc. for emergency use. Comrade Yu Degen personally visited the cooperative members who were already ill to see what difficulties they had and tried to help solve them. On the night of July 12, cooperative member Yu Lixin had a fever and was unconscious, and his wife was frightened and crying. When Yu Degen learned about it, he personally took the patient to the county hospital with several cooperative cadres and was responsible for borrowing 18 yuan from the credit cooperative to help complete the hospitalization procedures. He repeatedly urged the patient to rest well and not worry about the production in the cooperative. On July 18, cooperative member Yu Lihao's wife was seriously ill, and her family said there was no hope and were busy with funeral arrangements. Comrade Yu Degen passed by the door and, after learning about this, told the family not to worry on the one hand and ran to the township government to repeatedly call the hospital to quickly send a doctor to the rescue on the other. Because the treatment was timely, both patients turned from danger to safety. Yu Lixin said moved after being discharged from the hospital: "If it weren't for the advanced cooperative and Comrade Yu, I would have been sleeping in the ground." Since then, Yu Lixin has been particularly active in production, accepting any work happily and without bargaining.
    Comrade Yu Degen's concern for the lives of the masses can be said to be meticulous. Even family disputes and disagreements between husband and wife, he feels that he has a responsibility to help solve them. For example, Li Lieshui and Liu Dexiang, a couple in Taishan Cooperative, were getting a divorce. Originally, the two had a good relationship, but later, after Liu Dexiang joined the Communist Youth League and worked actively, returning late from meetings at night, Li Lieshui suspected that his wife's behavior was problematic. After learning about this situation, Comrade Yu Degen found Li Lieshui and explained: "If your wife's behavior is problematic, why is her prestige among women so high? You are a smart person, and the masses will not support a person with bad behavior, right? Running a cooperative depends on everyone. If everyone doesn't let their wives come out to work, how can the cooperative be run...". These words touched Li Lieshui's heart, and the suspicion that had existed for half a year was eliminated by Comrade Yu Degen. Now the couple is happily working and living together again.
    In his work, Comrade Yu Degen is also good at giving play to the role of collective leadership. Especially after the merger of four small townships into one large township, he paid more attention to collective leadership. He knew that contacting and uniting cadres was a prerequisite for going deep among and contacting the masses. Therefore, he conscientiously implemented the principle of collective leadership and division of labor and responsibility, dividing the Party branch into three aspects: production cooperation, Party and mass work, and finance and economics, and regularly convened branch committees to discuss the work of various departments. In his work, he pays special attention to respecting the opinions of others. Whenever cadres ask him about things, he always asks others first: "What is your opinion?" If others' opinions are the same as his own, he expresses agreement; if there are differences from his own opinions, he puts forward his personal opinions for the other party to consider and explains the reasons for disagreement, and makes a decision after reaching a consensus. For example, during the summer harvest pre-distribution, Wu Jiafu, the director of Yanghu Advanced Cooperative, asked for instructions on the method of distributing rations. First, he put forward the opinion of distributing rations according to the number of people. Comrade Yu Degen, based on the report "Qianxi Cooperative Corrects the Deviation of Distributing Grain According to the Number of People" published in the Anyi Daily, explained that the method of distributing grain according to the number of people would affect the enthusiasm of cooperative members, and only distributing rations according to the actual labor points was fair and reasonable. After his explanation, Wu Jiafu agreed with his opinion. The cadres below reflected that this leadership method has three advantages: ? It respects the opinions of others, and the other party is satisfied; ? Both parties put forward opinions, consider them repeatedly, and decisions can avoid or reduce one-sidedness; ? Letting the other party put forward their opinions first prompts the other party to think carefully before raising questions.

    善于倾听群众意见的党总支书记
    段先萍
    江西安义县台山乡党总支书记喻德根同志，是一个能深入群众、联系群众的好干部。我在台山乡工作过两次，每次和群众一谈起喻德根同志的时候，群众都称赞他办事热心、能干，关心大家的疾苦。因此，两年来，受过五次表扬。
    喻德根同志因为解放前亲身过过饥寒交迫的生活，很懂得农民的疾苦，因此，担任乡干部以后，善于倾听群众的意见和要求。在方法上，一方面是抓干部汇报，他认为这是来自各方面的情况，比较全面；几次汇报会上，我都看到他静听着大家的发言，并详细的记下来，对群众的意见和要求还划上一个记号。另一方面是亲自下去，利用群众冬天围炉闲谈、夏天庭前乘凉的机会，和群众从平常小事谈起，一直谈到群众吐出自己的意见和要求为止。他认为这样了解情况才比较深刻、具体。了解到群众的意见和要求，特别是发现了带普遍性的问题以后，他便和乡上几个脱产干部商量，分别不同情况，召开党支委会、党员大会、干部大会或乡人民代表会议，依靠大家的智慧，共同研究分析，弄清楚在群众的意见和要求中，哪些是正确的，哪些是不正确的，哪些是个别问题，哪些是带普遍性的问题，然后决定解决的办法。对于正确的意见和要求，尽早解决；不正确的意见和要求，耐心解释，说明原因；带普遍性的问题，动员全体干部来解决；个别问题，亲自动手或指定干部去解决。比如今年春耕生产开始，从干部到群众右倾保守思想都比较严重，当党支部提出要在去年平均每亩三百零三斤的基础上增产到五百七十五斤的时候，群众反映：“合作化可以加快，粮食增产只能慢慢提高”、“除非就来拖拉机，所有的田都下肥田粉”。台山社有一个老农还笑话干部说：“你们是梦想天鹅肉吃！”当时，喻德根同志还在原台山小乡工作，他搜集了这些反映后，认为是一个严重问题，便和台山社永安队的社干部研究过好几次，找出了问题产生的原因：是社员对于合作化高潮给发展生产带来的有利条件认识不足，以老眼光看新情况。于是，喻德根同志便建议党支部根据地委宣传部编写的“春耕生产宣传讲话”，在群众中开展了一次宣传运动，着重说明今年生产的有利条件，也指出了困难方面；并建议在社员中开展了一次“提合理化建议运动”。群众发动之后，十天之内，社员就提出了五十二条合理化建议，归纳起来，就成了全年增产的十项措施。对于社员喻立春提出自制颗粒肥料的建议，由于新建的社，资金不足，暂时不能实行，喻德根同志也找他作了个别解释。因此他满意地说：“干部想问题真周到，答复问题也真及时。”以后在生产运动中曾不断出现了好多问题，如缺耕牛、劳动组织不健全、妇女底分过低、社员没有零钱用、夏收夏种劳动力不足等，喻德根同志都紧紧依靠了全体干部和广大群众及时进行了解决。每解决一个问题或满足了社员的要求以后，群众的生产热情就高涨一次。夏收夏种运动中，采取了按件计工的办法，纠正了妇女底分过低的现象后，妇女的出勤率达到了100％。今年台山社，早稻比去年增产25.8％，去年只有一千七百三十五亩双季稻，今年在严重的干旱面前，还种了二千八百二十亩双季稻，估计全年可增产70％。社员反映：“这是党支部领导的好，也有喻书记一份功劳。”
    喻德根同志不仅重视领导生产，注意解决社员在生产上的困难，同时，还注意体贴和关心群众的生活，每当群众提出了生活上的困难时，他总要设身处地的想一想：“假如我是他的话如何办？”于是帮助群众解决疾苦的劲头就来了。夏收夏种中，任务很繁重，天气又异常炎热，全乡有一百八十个社员得了病。他了解这个问题后，先找了干部分析得病的原因，主要有这样几个：有的劳动过后，就洗冷水澡；普遍吃冷水；有的中午从事劳动，天气太热，身体受不了；有的在露天睡觉，到半夜转冷受寒。然后，又找到台山社的社委研究了解决的办法：?提倡起早摸夜，中午让社员有较充分的休息时间；?指定专人烧茶，禁止喝冷水；?晚上过了十点钟，干部分工催社员到房里睡；?社里购买一些人丹、十滴水等，以备急用。对于已经得病的社员，喻德根同志亲自去访问，看看有什么困难，并设法帮助解决。7月12日深夜，社员喻立信发烧发得不省人事，他的爱人吓得哭哭啼啼。喻德根知道了，亲自与几个社干部把病人送到县卫生院，并负责向信用合作社借了人民币十八元，帮助办好住院手续，又再三叮嘱病人好好休养，不要挂心社里生产。7月18日社员喻立浩的爱人病得很严重，家里人都说没有指望了，忙着办理后事，喻德根同志从门外经过，知道这件事情后，一方面叫全家人不要急，另一方面跑到乡政府一再挂电话要求卫生院赶快派医师来急救。由于救治得快，这两个病人都转危为安。喻立信出院后感动得说：“要不是高级社，要不是喻书记，我早就睡在土里了。”从此喻立信在生产上特别积极，分配任何工作，都愉快接受，不讲价钱。
    喻德根同志关心群众生活，可以说无微不至，甚至家庭纠纷、夫妻对口，他也感到自己有帮助解决的责任。比如台山社李列水和刘德香夫妻两个闹离婚，本来两人感情很好，后来因为刘德香入团后，工作积极，晚上开会回得晚一些，李列水便怀疑老婆作风有了问题。喻德根同志了解这个情况之后，便找着李列水解释说：“要是你爱人作风有问题，为什么在妇女中的威信有这样高？你是聪明人，一个作风不好的人，群众是不会拥护的吧？办合作社要靠大家，要是大家都不让自己的爱人出来工作，合作社怎能办好………”。这段话，打动了李列水的心，半年以来存在的怀疑被喻德根同志消除了。现在夫妻二人又愉快地在一起劳动、生活了。
    喻德根同志在工作中，还善于发挥集体领导的作用，特别是由四个小乡合并成一个大乡后，他对集体领导更加重视了，他知道联系和团结好干部是深入和联系群众的前提，因此，他认真贯彻了集体领导、分工负责的原则，将党总支分为生产合作、党群、财经三个方面，定期召开总支委员会，讨论各部门的工作。他在工作中特别注意尊重人家的意见，每当干部问他的事情时，总是先问别人：“你的意见如何？”如果人家的意见与自己的看法相同时，就表示同意；与自己的意见有出入时，再提出个人的意见请对方考虑，并说明不同意的原因，达到认识一致时再作决定。比如在夏收预分中，阳湖高级社社长吴家福请示分口粮的办法，首先他提出按人分口粮的意见，喻德根同志便根据安义报登出“前溪社纠正按人分粮的偏向”的报道，说明按人分粮的办法，会影响社员的积极性，只有按实做劳动工分分配口粮，才公平合理。经过他的解释以后，吴家福就同意了他的意见。这样的领导方法，下面干部反映有三个好处：?尊重了人家的意见，对方满意；?双方提出意见，反复考虑，决定问题就可以避免或减少片面性；?让对方先提意见，促使对方在提问题之前要好好考虑。
