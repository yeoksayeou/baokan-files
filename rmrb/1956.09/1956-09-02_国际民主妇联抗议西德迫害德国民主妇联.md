Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 1st. The Women's International Democratic Federation issued a communique on August 31, strongly protesting the West German police's search of the German Democratic Women's Federation and some prominent women, confiscation of documents, and other barbaric measures. This communique has been telegraphed to the West German government and President Heuss.
    The communique stated: "These measures violate the most basic rights and personal freedom, and are an insult to the entire women's movement.
    "Women see once again: the democracy won at such a great sacrifice is facing new threats, and they see the renewed use of the methods of 1933, which once brought fascism and aggression.
    "Based on the principles of the United Nations Charter, the Women's International Democratic Federation demands the immediate restoration of freedom of association and respect for democratic freedoms as the fundamental basis for security and peace."

    新华社柏林1日电　国际民主妇女联合会8月31日发表公报，强硬抗议西德警察对德国民主妇女联合会和一些著名妇女进行搜查、没收文件和采取其他蛮横措施。这份公报已经用电报拍给西德政府和总统豪斯。
    公报说：“这些措施侵犯了最基本的权利和人身自由，是对整个妇女运动的侮辱。
    “妇女们又一次看到：以极其重大的牺牲换来的民主受到新的威胁，看到重新使用1933年的手段，这种手段曾经带来了法西斯主义和侵略。
    “国际民主妇女联合会根据联合国宪章的原则，要求立即恢复结社自由，要求尊重作为安全和和平的根本基础的民主自由。”
