Wolfberry Jujube Has a Very Good Effect in Treating Tuberculosis

    (Our newspaper reports) Tonghua City, Jilin Province, traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Yang Yongqing has achieved very good results in treating tuberculosis with the traditional Chinese medicine wolfberry jujube. Many patients in Tonghua City suffering from tuberculous lymphadenitis, bone tuberculosis, skin tuberculosis, and tuberculous epididymitis have experienced improvement or recovery soon after taking wolfberry jujube.

    Wolfberry is a very inexpensive traditional Chinese medicine. When combined with red dates and processed in a specific way, it becomes wolfberry jujube. In order to further study the effect of wolfberry jujube in treating tuberculosis, the Jilin Provincial Department of Health recently established the Wolfberry Jujube Efficacy Research Committee.
