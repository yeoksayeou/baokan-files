    Collecting and Selling Goods at Flood Victims' Homes
    Since the beginning of August, the water in Baiyangdian has been rising day by day. All twenty-plus villages under the jurisdiction of the Duancun Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei Province have been surrounded by the floodwaters. Many flood victims have deep water in their courtyards, making it very inconvenient to buy and sell goods. In order to facilitate the purchase and sale of goods for flood victims, the Duancun Supply and Marketing Cooperative rented some boats and selected thirty-five cadres to form twenty mobile supply and marketing teams to personally collect and sell goods in various villages. The supply and marketing teams rowed boats to the doorsteps of flood victims and used bamboo poles and baskets to collect and sell goods, while also conducting consolation and registration work. When boats could not enter small alleys, salespeople waded through the water to deliver goods to flood victims. The cooperative's spirit of enthusiastically serving the masses greatly moved the flood victims. Liu Zhizheng, who is in his sixties, said when a salesperson delivered goods to him: "You are so thoughtful! How can this old and lonely man thank you enough!" In the ten days from August 4th to 14th, the cooperative supplied flood victims with a total of over 14,500 yuan worth of salt, oil, daily necessities, etc.; it also purchased many waste products and other items from the flood victims. Currently, this cooperative is preparing to transfer a batch of production materials needed for sideline and handicraft production to supply to flood victims.

    到灾民家里收售货物
    自8月初以来，白洋淀的水一天天高涨。河北省端村供销社负责供销的二十多个村庄，全部被洪水包围了。许多灾民的院子里面有很深的水，出外买卖很不方便。端村供销社，为便利灾民买卖东西，租了一些船只，抽出三十五个干部，组成了二十个流动供销组，亲自到各村收售货物。供销组把船划到灾民的屋跟前，用竹杆、竹篮收售货物，同时还结合进行慰问、登记工作。遇到船不能进去的小胡同，售货员便涉水给灾民送货。供销社热情为群众服务的精神，使灾民很感动。六十多岁的刘志正，当售货员送货给他时，便说：“你们想得真周到！叫我这孤老头怎么感谢你们呢！”从8月4日到14日的十天中，供销社供应灾民食盐、油、日用百货等总值达一万四千五百多元；还收购了灾民许多废品及其他东西。现在，这个社正准备调运一批进行副业和手工业生产所需的生产资料，供应灾民。
