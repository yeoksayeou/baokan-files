    Reflections on "San Mao's Diary"
    Letters from readers Zhang Qi, Xu Renda, Zhao Yun, Xu Zhiyuan, Suo Guang, Li Zunwu, and others express their welcome for Zhang Leping's cartoon "San Mao's Diary." Zhang Qi's letter stated: "San Mao's Diary" is loved by many readers, especially children, and my little sister and I are especially looking forward to reading "San Mao's Diary." Zhao Yun's letter stated: Zhang Leping's past "The Adventures of San Mao the Orphan" was very popular, and he hopes that he will introduce the image of San Mao after his rebirth to children more and better.
    In their letters, readers raised a question about a panel in "San Mao's Diary" called "Sister is Lost" (see page 8 of this newspaper on August 23rd): Because San Mao was chasing his sister, his left shoe was stepped off by his younger brother, but in the picture below, why is it San Mao's right shoe that is off? The readers believe that although this does not affect the content of the story, the author should not be careless about such small details.

    对“三毛日记”的反映
    读者张祺、徐仁达、兆昀、徐志远、索光、李尊五等来信，对张乐平的画“三毛日记”表示欢迎。张祺的来信说：“三毛日记”受到很多读者尤其是小孩们的喜爱，我和小妹妹更是期待着看“三毛日记”。兆昀来信说：张乐平过去画的“三毛流浪记”，很受人欢迎，希望他更多更好地将新生后的三毛形象介绍给儿童。
    读者在来信中，对“三毛日记”中的“妹妹走失了”一幅画（见8月23日本报第八版）提出了一个疑问：三毛由于追寻妹妹，左脚的鞋子被弟弟踩掉了，但是，在下图中，为什么是三毛的右脚的鞋子掉了呢？读者认为：虽然这并不影响故事的内容，但是，这种小小的情节，也希望作者不要疏忽大意。
