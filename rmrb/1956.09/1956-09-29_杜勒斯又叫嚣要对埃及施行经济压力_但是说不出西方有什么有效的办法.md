Xinhua News Agency, Washington Dispatch: At a press conference on September 26th, Secretary of State Dulles was asked if the United States would support the positions of Britain and France in the Security Council's debate on the Suez Canal issue. Dulles said he thought that generally speaking, it would.

Answering another question, Dulles said that once the "Users' Association" was established, the U.S. government intended to assist or enact regulations prohibiting ships flying the American flag from directly paying tolls to the Egyptian government. He added that the United States does not currently intend to extend this method to American ships owned by companies of other countries, registered under the laws of other countries, and flying the flags of other countries.

A reporter pointed out that, as a result, since most American ships passing through the canal are registered in Panama or Liberia, this method is unlikely to change the amount of money these companies and ships are currently paying to the Egyptian government. Therefore, it probably won't have much effect. Dulles replied that this was a fact.

Dulles also admitted that bypassing the Cape of Good Hope would not exert much economic pressure on Egypt. He said that in that case, "a large number of ships will still pass through the canal because many ships are registered in other countries; these ships will be transferred to a country that makes it easier for them to pass through the canal. He further said that if you are willing to spend one thousand or ten thousand dollars to inflict one dollar of damage on Egypt, it will ultimately not be a very beneficial thing. It is a very wrong idea to think that not using the canal can inflict any serious economic blow on Egypt."

A reporter asked Dulles what the West would do if Egypt did not allow ships of the "Users' Association" to pass.

He said he saw no reason to force passage through the canal. He "doesn't think the current situation has reached the point where drastic actions like war must be taken."

    杜勒斯又叫嚣要对埃及施行经济压力
    但是说不出西方有什么有效的办法
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：在9月26日的记者招待会上，有人问美国国务卿杜勒斯，在安全理事会关于苏伊士运河问题的辩论中，美国是否将支持英国和法国的立场。杜勒斯说，他认为一般讲是要支持的。
    杜勒斯在回答另一个问题的时候说，一待“使用国协会”成立，美国政府就打算援助或者制定禁止挂着美国国旗的船只直接向埃及政府缴纳通行费的规章。他又说，美国目前不打算把这种办法扩大到属于其他国家的公司、根据其他国家的法律注册、并且悬挂其他国家旗帜的美国船只。
    有记者指出，这样一来，由于通过运河的大部分美国船只是在巴拿马或者利比里亚注册的，因此，这种办法不大会改变这些公司和船只目前正在付给埃及政府的款项的数目。因此大概不会产生什么效果。杜勒斯回答说，这是一个事实。
    杜勒斯还承认，绕道好望角的办法也不能对埃及产生多大经济压力。他说，在那种情况下，“仍然会有大量的船只通过运河，因为有许多船只是在别的国家注册的；这些船只将被转移到会使它们比较易于通过运河的一个国家去注册。他又说，如果你不惜使自己花一千美元或一万美元的代价使埃及遭受一个美元的损失，这在最后一定不会是一桩非常有利的事情。如果认为不使用运河就可以使埃及受到任何严重的经济打击，这是一个非常错误的想法。”
    有记者问杜勒斯，如果埃及不让“使用国协会”的船只通过，西方会怎么办。
    他说，他认为没有理由会强行通过运河。他“不认为现在的局势已经到了必须采取像打仗这样的激烈行动的程度了”。
