Opinions on the Collection of Papers on the Periodization of Ancient Chinese History
Dong Sheng

The "Selected Papers on the Periodization of Chinese Slavery and Feudalism," edited by the History Research Editorial Department, has been published by Sanlian Bookstore. This has a certain reference value and promotional effect for further carrying out the discussion on the periodization of ancient Chinese history in the future.

This collection of papers includes a selection of papers published in various newspapers and periodicals from the founding of the People's Republic of China to May 1955. Although these papers hold different opinions, they share a common feature: the authors strive to use Marxist viewpoints and methods to study and discuss the periodization of ancient Chinese history, and have achieved considerable success.

The papers selected for this collection mainly focus on the discussion of the nature of Western Zhou society, and are divided into two parts according to different opinions. The papers in each part are basically edited according to the order of publication. In this way, readers can easily know which papers advocate that the Western Zhou Dynasty was a slave society and which papers advocate that the Western Zhou Dynasty was a feudal society. Secondly, it can also be seen from this the basic trend of the entire discussion. At the same time, the inclusion of papers from both sides of the argument also facilitates readers to refer to each other and conduct research.

However, the historical period covered by the periodization discussion ranges from the Western Zhou Dynasty to the Qin, Han, Wei, and Jin Dynasties. Even if opinions on the nature of Western Zhou society are basically the same, there may be great differences in opinions on the entire periodization problem, especially on key issues. Moreover, the papers selected for concentration are not all about the Western Zhou Dynasty, and many are about the Warring States Period, the two Han Dynasties, and the standard issues. In this way, it may not be convenient to refer to them.

Therefore, the following editing forms can be considered: The first is to collect papers discussing the entire periodization problem; the second is to edit in groups according to historical periods; the third is to edit a collection on a specific issue, such as the periodization standard issue alone. In terms of time, the order of publication can still be followed, but papers that directly argue with each other should be placed together as much as possible. In this way, there may be both a center and consideration for the overall situation and the connection between the various parties in the discussion.

In addition, within the period covered by the collection of papers, there have already been quite a few papers in this area, and the collection has included less than a quarter of them. This inevitably leads to omissions, preventing many other different opinions from being reflected.

Publishing such a collection of papers is conducive to "letting a hundred flowers bloom." In the past year or so, many papers have been published on the issue of the periodization of Chinese slavery and feudalism. It is recommended that the History Research Editorial Department continue to edit and publish collections.

At the same time, it is also necessary to systematically edit and publish collections of papers or special collections on other important historical issues currently being discussed in the historical academic community, such as the formation of the Han nationality, the budding of Chinese capitalism, and the periodization of modern Chinese history.

    对中国古史分期问题论文选集的意见
    东生
    历史研究编辑部编辑的“中国的奴隶制与封建制分期问题论文选集”，已经由三联书店出版了。这对今后进一步开展中国古史分期问题的讨论，是有一定的参考价值和推动作用的。
    这个论文选集，收集了从中华人民共和国成立以来到1955年5月这个时期中在各种报刊上发表的一部分论文。这些论文尽管持有不同意见，但是其中有一个共同的特点：论文作者都是力求运用马克思主义的观点和方法来研究和讨论中国古史分期问题，并且取得了相当的成绩。
    这个选集所选的论文主要是集中在关于西周社会性质的讨论，并且按不同的意见分为两部分，各部分的论文基本上是依着发表时间先后来编辑的。这样，首先可以让读者一开始就容易知道哪些论文主张西周是奴隶社会，哪些论文主张西周是封建社会。其次，还可以从中看出整个讨论的基本趋向。同时，由于选入了部分争论双方的论文，也便于读者互相参照和进行研究。
    但是，分期问题讨论所包括的历史时期是从西周一直到秦汉魏晋，即使在西周社会性质问题上意见基本一致，而在整个分期问题、特别是在关键问题上的意见却可能大有分歧。而且集中所选的论文并不全是讨论西周问题，还有不少是讨论战国、两汉以及标准问题的。这样，参考起来未必方便。
    因此，可以考虑如下的各种编辑形式：第一种是收集讨论整个分期问题的论文；第二种是按各个历史时期分组编辑；第三种是可就某一问题，如分期标准问题单独编辑成集。在时间上仍可以发表先后为序，但互相直接争论的论文尽可能放在一起。这样可能会既有中心，又照顾到全面和讨论各方之间的联系。
    此外，在论文选集所包括的时期内，在这方面已经有相当多的论文，而选集所收进的还不到四分之一。这就不免有所遗漏，使其他许多不同的意见不能得到反映。
    编辑这样的论文选集出版，是有利于“百家争鸣”的。一年多来，在中国的奴隶制与封建制分期问题方面又发表了不少论文，建议历史研究编辑部继续编辑选集出版。
    同时，也有必要有计划地编辑出版当前历史学界正在讨论中的其他重要历史问题，例如汉民族形成、中国资本主义萌芽、中国近代史分期等问题的论文选集或专集。
