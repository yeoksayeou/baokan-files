Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 23rd. The Northwest Institute of Agricultural Science has bred "No. 612" and "No. 134" improved wheat varieties. According to small-scale sowing trials conducted last year on irrigated land at the Wugong Farm, the yield of "No. 612" wheat this year was 16.2% higher than "No. 6028" wheat and 18.4% higher than "Bima No. 1" wheat. At the same time, this wheat has strong stalks, is cold and drought resistant, resistant to wheat blossom midges and wheat black powder disease, and has strong resistance to stripe rust. The yield of "No. 134" wheat, which is another variety suitable for planting in irrigated land, is 12% to 14.7% higher than "No. 6028" and "Bima No. 1" wheat on average. Its lodging resistance and resistance to pests and diseases are also superior to or equivalent to some of the improved wheat varieties that have already been promoted. At present, in order to determine the suitable range of these two new wheat varieties, the Northwest Institute of Agricultural Science has distributed the seeds harvested this year to farms and agricultural technology extension stations in Wugong, Shaanxi Province, and other places to prepare for comparative experiments.

    选育出两种小麦良种
    据新华社西安23日电　西北农业科学研究所选育出“六一二号”和“一三四号”小麦良种。根据去年在武功农场水地所作小区域播种试验证明：“六一二号”小麦今年收获的产量比“六零二八号”麦高16.2％，比“碧蚂一号”麦增产18.4％；同时这种小麦麦秆强硬，它还耐寒耐旱，能抗吸浆虫和秆黑粉病，对条锈病也有很强的抵抗能力。另一种适合水地种植的“一三四号”小麦的产量，比“六零二八号”、“碧蚂一号”小麦平均增产12％到14.7％。它的抗倒伏和抗病虫害等能力也都优于或相等于一些已推广的小麦良种。目前，西北农业科学研究所为了确定这两个新种小麦的适应范围，已经将今年收获的种子分发到陕西省武功等地的农场和农业技术推广站，准备进行比较试验。
