Comrade Zhang Zhongliang, First Secretary of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee, speaks:

I fully agree with the three reports made to the congress by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping on behalf of the Central Committee. These reports comprehensively and profoundly summarize the rich experience of the Party in leading our country's democratic revolution and socialist revolution since the Seventh National Congress, and propose to the entire Party the great task of building a socialist society. This is an example of the combination of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution. All Party members in the Gansu region will unite more closely around the Party Central Committee and strive to realize these reports and the various resolutions to be made by the Congress.

Fundamental Changes Have Taken Place in All Aspects of Gansu Province

Since the liberation of Gansu, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, due to the implementation of the Party's ethnic policies, a series of democratic reforms and socialist transformations have been carried out, and socialist construction has been undertaken at the same time. Fundamental changes have taken place in all aspects of the province's politics and economy, and the material and cultural living standards of the people have been significantly improved.

Before liberation, Gansu was a region with complex ethnic relations and serious phenomena of mutual killing; now, new relationships of equality and unity have been established among all ethnic groups.

Before liberation, transportation in Gansu was very inconvenient; now, highways are accessible in all directions, and railways have been opened to traffic for more than 1,400 kilometers.

Before liberation, except for the Yumen Oilfield, there were no other large industries; now, rich iron ore, copper ore, coal mines, rare metals and other mineral deposits have been discovered, and large-scale factories and mining enterprises are being built in Lanzhou, Zhangye, Yumen, Baiyin and other places.

Before liberation, the entire province was ruled by a feudal and semi-feudal economy; now, agriculture and handicrafts have basically achieved cooperativization, private industry and commerce have implemented industry-wide public-private joint ownership, and the socialist economy has achieved a solid leading position in both urban and rural areas.

Before liberation, there was often not enough food, and the total output in 1949 was only 4.6 billion catties; now, not only is there enough to eat, but there is also a surplus of grain. This year, the total output will exceed 10.3 billion catties.

With the continuous development of production, the people's purchasing power in 1955 increased by more than two times compared with 1950; science, culture, education, and health undertakings have also developed significantly compared with before liberation.

In the process of these great changes, the socialist consciousness of the people throughout the province has been unprecedentedly enhanced, a large number of local cadres of all ethnic groups have grown up, and the number of Communist Party members has increased from more than 17,000 to more than 250,000. Our Party has established a lofty prestige among the people of all ethnic groups in the province. All of these have created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for us to further complete socialist transformation and carry out socialist construction.

At present, the main problems in rural areas are to strengthen the production leadership and organizational construction of cooperatives, continue to develop agricultural production, lead the people of all ethnic groups to march towards nature, seize more freedom from nature, adapt agricultural development to industrial construction, and seek the continuous improvement and enhancement of people's lives.

Now, I would like to make the following statement on the issue of fully utilizing water resources, changing the natural landscape, and developing agricultural production in the Gansu region:

Great Agricultural Potential, Broad Prospects for Development

Gansu has great agricultural potential and broad prospects for development. The province has a total area of more than 800 million mu, of which the existing cultivated land is more than 70 million mu, and the area of ​​contiguous forests is more than 15 million mu. The two only account for 10.7 percent of the total area, and most areas remain to be developed. Many places in the province can grow cotton. The Hexi and Yellow River coastal areas can open up 7 million mu of cotton fields. The cotton produced is of good quality and high yield. Last year, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu in Dunhuang County was 100 catties. Many places can plant mulberry trees and raise silkworms, especially the Bailong River and Xi Han River basins. More than 60 percent of spring silkworms in Cheng County this year produced more than eight catties of silk per silkworm seed, which is more than half a catty higher than the national average quota. Many places produce flax, hemp, medicinal materials and local specialties, a large number of oilseeds and a certain amount of woody oil materials. Aquaculture and horticultural crops can also be developed in many places. Animal husbandry can also be greatly developed, and its output value already accounts for more than 17 percent of the national economy. The average yield of grain per mu this year is only 177 catties, but in more than 30 counties, several high-yield fields with a yield of more than 1,000 catties per mu have emerged, which shows that it is possible to increase the yield per mu to 400 to 500 catties within twelve years. If all these potentials can be fully utilized, we will be able to produce 40 billion catties of grain, more than 8 million dan of ginned cotton, and 500,000 dan of silkworm cocoons every year by 1967. This can provide a reliable material basis for guaranteeing industrial construction and improving people's lives.

Dry Climate, Frequently Threatened by Drought

Although the agricultural potential is great and the development prospects are broad, 78 percent of the existing cultivated land is dry land, and the existing abundant water resources have not been fully utilized. Moreover, located in the Northwest Plateau, the climate is dry, and the average annual rainfall is only about 300 mm, and in the central and western regions, it is often below 300 mm, and the rainy season is mostly in autumn. Therefore, agriculture is frequently threatened by drought. With the progress of industrial construction, the industrial water consumption will increase significantly, and the existing water conservancy is far from meeting the needs. It is estimated that the province's water resources have a surface water of about 60 billion cubic meters, plus groundwater and rainwater. As long as they are fully utilized, nearly 70 million mu of irrigated land can be developed, and industrial water consumption can be solved. Therefore, how to fully utilize all water resources such as river water, rainwater, and groundwater has become a key issue for the entire province.

Four Types of Regions

According to the natural characteristics and water utilization of various regions in the province, they can be roughly divided into the following four categories:

First, Hexi and Yinchuan are areas with large-scale water irrigation, where irrigated land accounts for 80 to 90 percent of the cultivated land area. There is little rainfall here, and there is no agriculture without water conservancy. The water source mainly relies on the Yellow River water and the Qilian Mountains snow water. When water is needed, the water volume is insufficient. When water is not needed, a large amount is lost, and leakage and waste are very serious. Large areas of wasteland cannot be cultivated due to lack of water conservancy, and factories and mines under construction also need a large amount of water supply. In the future, we should pay attention to increasing income and reducing expenditure, storing water and draining water, economical water use, washing alkali and draining alkali, and preventing land salinization.

Second, the Bailong River and Xi Han River basins have abundant rainfall and abundant water sources, and most of the water sources are in the mountains. The temperature in the mountains is lower and there is more rainfall, while the temperature in the rivers is higher and there is less rainfall. Therefore, there is a saying that "floods in the rainy season become rivers, droughts become mountains, and no floods or droughts become half mountains." The main problem here is to drain and store water in the mountains, and divert water to irrigate the rivers and terraced fields on the hillsides, changing the natural contradiction between the water on the mountain tops, hillsides, and plains.

Third, the southeastern region is mostly hills and plateaus, with 80 to 90 percent of the cultivated land being dry land, and severe soil erosion. Although the rainfall is generally sufficient, most of the rainwater is in autumn. After changing the mountainous land into terraced fields and dry land into irrigated land here, not only can soil erosion be prevented and land production be stabilized, but also the yield can be increased by 50 to 100 percent. Therefore, it is particularly important to carry out soil and water conservation, implement terraced field irrigation and high-lift water pumping irrigation.

Fourth, the central arid region has little rainfall, insufficient water sources, severe soil erosion, and is frequently threatened by drought. The main problems here are insufficient water sources and low groundwater levels. Therefore, all available river water, rainwater, and groundwater must be utilized. On both sides of the river, water diversion and water lifting irrigation should be developed, and high-lift water lifting tools should be promoted. Where there are underground water sources, wells should be dug and drilled, and the drilling of deep wells and terraced wells should be promoted. Where there is no river water or underground water source, flood diversion, flood storage irrigation and sand-covered fields should be promoted to conserve moisture and resist drought.

Exploiting Favorable Conditions, Overcoming Unfavorable Conditions

We have gradually gone from not knowing to knowing, and from not knowing clearly to knowing more clearly about the above-mentioned potentials and characteristics. Moreover, this cognitive process is a struggle between advanced ideas overcoming backward ideas, and a down-to-earth and realistic work style overcoming subjectivism and bureaucratic work styles. Originally, nature is a unity of opposites. For people, it has both favorable and harmful aspects. As long as people can grasp the laws of nature and change the face of nature, then good and bad are not absolute, nor are they fixed and unchangeable. Gansu has the difficult aspects of bare mountains and ridges, and insufficient rainfall, but also has the favorable aspects of rich resources and great potential. Recognizing its characteristics and mastering its laws can fully exploit the favorable aspects and overcome the unfavorable aspects. However, many of our comrades always emphasize the difficult aspects and ignore the favorable aspects. They only see the unfavorable natural phenomena such as the lack of trees and grass on the mountains, the erosion of gullies and slopes, the lack of rainfall, and the lack of water irrigation. In fact, as long as horizontal ditches are dug well on the mountains, land edges are built up, and flood barriers are built, grass can be cultivated, trees can be planted, and floods can be diverted for irrigation, turning harm into benefit. Many of our comrades can recite this Marxist principle that Communists should not only understand the world, but also transform the world; but when faced with a specific situation like Gansu, they cannot well combine this theory with the actual situation, and even have pessimistic and disappointed negative emotions. In fact, after a series of arduous work in the past few years, achievements and experience have been gained, especially on the basis of agricultural cooperativization. Last winter and this spring, irrigated land was expanded by more than 5 million mu, and soil erosion was controlled in an area of ​​more than 14,000 square kilometers. One hundred and three of the province's 550 arid townships have basically gotten rid of the threat of drought. Taking Gaoya Township in Yuzhong County as an example, in 1953, the entire township had an average of only one-tenth of a mu of irrigated land per three people, and 80 percent of the farmers lacked food. Now, each person has nearly one mu of irrigated land, and every household has surplus grain. These vivid facts have enhanced our confidence in recognizing and changing the natural landscape of Gansu. However, some people have developed another idea, thinking that transforming nature is an easy task, ignoring that it is a long-term, complex, and arduous task, and attempting to complete the work of twelve years in a few years. This kind of impetuous emotion and passive waiting thought are equally one-sided and subjectivist, and need to be overcome.

Rely on the Strength of the Masses to Change the Natural Landscape

It is unimaginable to fully utilize water resources and change the natural landscape without relying on the strength and wisdom of millions of people. Therefore, we must rely on the masses. The masses are the source of strength. They have accumulated extremely rich experience in the long-term struggle with nature. For example: During the Jiaqing period of the Qing Dynasty, in the event of a severe drought, someone discovered vigorously growing wheat on a sand pile at the mouth of a mouse hole, and realized that laying sand could resist drought. So they created the method of laying sand fields. According to scientists, this kind of sand field has a large permeability, small evaporation, and has the advantages of heat resistance, moisture retention, heat preservation, and alkali suppression. The yield is one to three times higher than that of the same land, and the maturity period is ten days to half a month earlier. It is very popular among the masses, and it is still an effective way for the masses in arid areas to fight against drought. After liberation, the masses and cadres in Hexi created the method of patching channels with pebbles in order to overcome channel leakage. This kind of pebble-patched channel will automatically harden after a long time through the scouring of fine sand and small stones in the flowing water and the infiltration pressure of water. It has strong anti-scour, anti-freeze and anti-leakage effects. At the same time, the engineering technology is simple, materials can be obtained locally, and the engineering cost is several to ten times lower than using asphalt and foreign ash. There are many similar examples. As long as we can always pay attention to concentrating these valuable experiences from the masses, persist in them, go through practice, concentrate them again, and persist in them again, we can achieve continuous victories in the struggle to transform nature. Especially on the basis of agricultural cooperativization, giving full play to the collective wisdom and strength of the masses will achieve greater results. Of course, relying on the masses must be combined with cherishing the strength of the masses and maintaining the enthusiasm of the masses, and must combine the current interests of the masses with the long-term interests. Demanding too quickly, assigning tasks that are too large, and only caring about long-term interests without taking care of current interests are all detached from reality and detached from the masses. This spring, the water conservancy and soil and water conservation tasks we assigned to the lower levels were somewhat too large and too urgent, and the lower levels added more layers, so that quite serious forced orders and relaxation of agricultural and sideline production occurred in some places, which is a lesson worth remembering.

Must Implement the Policy of "Overall Planning, Strengthening Leadership"

Building water conservancy and changing the face of nature is a comprehensive task that requires close integration of all aspects. Therefore, we must implement the policy of "overall planning, strengthening leadership." In specific measures, we must pay attention to the combination of upstream and downstream water use, the combination of industrial and agricultural water use, the combination of large, medium and small projects, the combination of water storage and drainage, and the combination of soil and water conservation and water conservancy projects. If insufficient attention is paid to these issues, and each goes its own way, small-scale and piecemeal work will cause the bad consequences of losing more than gaining, and taking care of one thing while losing sight of another.

In the past few years, the guidance and support and encouragement from the Party Central Committee and the State Council to us have been great, but we feel that the responsible comrades of the relevant departments of the Central Committee have gone to Gansu less frequently, and they still do not understand the specific situation of Gansu sufficiently. Therefore, when solving certain specific problems, it is inevitable that there will be some improperly handled and untimely phenomena. In the future, in addition to timely and systematically reporting the situation, we also ask relevant departments of the Central Committee to give us more guidance and help.

    充分利用水利资源发展农业生产
    中共甘肃省委员会第一书记　张仲良同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇、周恩来和邓小平同志代表中央委员会向大会所作的三个报告。这些报告，全面地深刻地总结了七次代表大会以来党领导我国民主革命和社会主义革命的丰富经验，并向全党提出了建成社会主义社会的伟大任务，这是马克思、列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的范例。甘肃地区全体党员将更紧密地团结在党中央的周围，为实现这些报告和大会将要作出的各项决议而奋斗。甘肃省各方面已发生了根本性的变化
    甘肃解放以来，在党中央的正确领导下，由于贯彻执行了党的民族政策，进行了一系列的民主改革和社会主义改造，同时进行了社会主义建设，全省政治、经济各方面已经发生了根本性的变化，人民的物质生活和文化生活水平得到了显著的提高。
    解放前，甘肃是一个民族关系复杂、互相仇杀现象比较严重的地区；现在各民族之间已经建立了平等、团结的新关系。
    解放前，甘肃的交通很不便利；现在公路已经四通八达，铁路已经通车一千四百多公里。
    解放前，除玉门油矿外，没有别的大工业；现在已经探明有丰富的铁矿、铜矿、煤矿、稀有金属和其他矿藏，正在兰州、张掖、玉门、白银厂等地兴建着规模宏大的厂矿企业。
    解放前，统治全省的是封建半封建经济；现在，农业和手工业已经基本上实现了合作化，私营工商业已经实行了全行业的公私合营，社会主义经济不论在城市或农村都取得了巩固的领导地位。
    解放前，粮食常不够吃，一九四九年总产量只有四十六亿斤；现在不但够吃，而且有了余粮，今年总产量将超过一百○三亿斤。
    随着生产的不断发展，人民购买力一九五五年比一九五○年上升了两倍多；科学、文化、教育、卫生事业也比解放前有了显著的发展。
    在这些伟大的变化过程中，全省人民的社会主义觉悟程度已空前提高，各民族当地干部已大批生长起来，共产党员已由一万七千余人，发展到二十五万余人。我们党已在全省各族人民中树立了崇高的威信。所有这些，都为我们进一步完成社会主义改造，进行社会主义建设创造了前所未有的优良条件。
    目前，在农村中主要的问题，是加强合作社的生产领导和组织建设，继续发展农业生产，领导各族人民向自然进军，从自然手中夺取更多的自由，使农业发展与工业建设相适应，求得人民生活的不断改善和提高。
    现在，我仅就甘肃地区充分利用水利资源，改变自然面貌，发展农业生产问题，作如下发言：农业潜力很大，有着广阔发展前途
    甘肃农业潜力很大，有着广阔的发展前途。全省总面积约八亿多亩，其中现有耕地七千多万亩，成片森林一千五百多万亩，两者仅占总面积的百分之十点七，大部地区尚待开发。全省很多地方可以植棉，河西与黄河沿岸地区能够开辟七百万亩棉田，所产棉花，质量好、产量高，敦煌去年全县平均亩产皮棉一百斤。很多地方可以植桑养蚕，特别是白龙江与西汉水流域更为适宜，成县今年春蚕每张蚕种出丝八斤的占百分之六十以上，比全国平均定额超过半斤。很多地方，出产亚麻、大麻、药材和土特产，出产大批油籽和一定数量的木本油料。很多地方，可以发展水产和园艺作物。畜牧业也可以大量发展，其产值已占国民经济的百分之十七多。粮食的每亩平均产量，今年虽只有一百七十七斤，但在三十多个县内已出现了若干亩产一千余斤的丰产田，这就说明，在十二年内把亩产量提高到四百到五百斤是可能的。所有这些潜力，只要能够充分加以发挥，将使我们到一九六七年的时候每年生产四百亿斤粮食，八百多万担皮棉，五十万担桑茧。这就可以给保证工业建设、改善人民生活提供可靠的物质基础。
    气候干燥，经常遭受旱灾威胁
    虽然农业潜力很大，发展前途广阔，但是，现有耕地百分之七十八是旱地，现有丰富水利资源还没有充分利用。而且，地处西北高原，气候干燥，年雨量平均只有三百公厘左右，中部、西部还常在三百公厘以下，降雨期又多在秋季，因此，农业经常遭受旱灾威胁。随着工业建设的进展，工业用水将大量增加，仅靠现有水利就远远不能满足需要。全省水利资源，据估算地面水约有六百亿方，加上地下水和雨水，只要充分利用，就可以发展近七千万亩水浇地，并使工业用水得到解决。所以，如何把河水、雨水、地下水等一切水利资源都充分加以利用，就成为全省一个关键性的问题。
    四类地区
    根据全省各个地区的自然特点和水的利用情况，大体可分为下列四类：
    第一，河西、银川是大面积水利灌溉的地区，水浇地占耕地面积百分之八十到九十。这里雨量稀少，没有水利就没有农业。水源主要靠黄河水与祁连山雪水，需水时，水量不足，不用水时大量流失，渗漏、浪费非常严重。有大片荒地因无水利不能垦种，正在兴建的工厂、矿山亦需大量供水。今后要注意开源节流，蓄水排水，经济用水，洗碱排碱，防止土地盐碛化。
    第二，白龙江、西汉水流域，雨量充足、水源旺盛，而且水源多在山上。山上气温较低，雨量较多，河川气温较高，雨量较少。因此有“雨涝成川，天旱成山，不涝不旱成半山”的说法。这里的主要问题是在山上排水蓄水，引灌川地与半山梯田，改变山顶、山腰与平川水的自然矛盾状况。
    第三，东南部地区，多为丘陵与高原，耕地百分之八十到九十为旱地，水土流失严重，雨量虽然一般够用，但雨水多在秋季。这里变山地为梯田、变旱地为水地之后，不仅可以防止水土流失，稳定土地产量，而且可以提高产量的百分之五十到一百，因此，开展水土保持，实行梯田灌溉与高扬程提水灌溉就特别重要。
    第四，中部干旱地区，雨量稀少，水源不足，水土流失严重，经常遭受干旱威胁。这里主要问题是水源不足、地下水位低。因此，河水、雨水、地下水凡是可以利用的都要利用。在河流两岸，要发展引水、提水灌溉，推广高扬程提水工具。有地下水源的地方，要挖泉、打井，并要推广打深井、打台级井。没有河水也没有地下水源的地方，要推广引洪、蓄洪灌溉和铺砂田以保墒抗旱。
    发挥有利条件，克服不利条件
    对于上述这些潜力和特点，我们是逐渐由不认识到认识，由认识不清楚到认识较清楚的，而且这个认识过程，是先进思想克服落后思想，深入实际、实事求是的作风克服主观主义、官僚主义作风的斗争过程。本来，自然界是一个矛盾的统一体，对于人们来说，它既有有利的方面，也就有为害的方面，只要人们能够掌握自然的规律，改变自然的面貌，那么好与坏并不是绝对的，也不是固定不变的。甘肃有光山秃岭，雨量不足等困难的一方面，但也有资源丰富、潜力巨大等有利的一方面，认识它的特点，掌握它的规律，就可以充分发挥有利方面，克服不利方面。然而，我们不少同志总是强调困难方面，忽视有利方面，只看见山上缺树缺草，沟坡冲刷，雨量不足，缺水灌溉等不利的自然现象。其实，只要在山上挖好水平沟，培起地边埂，打起拦洪坝，就可以育草植树，引洪灌溉，变有害为有利。共产党人不仅要认识世界，而且要改造世界，这条马克思主义原则，我们许多同志都会背诵的；但是当面对着甘肃这样一个具体情况时，却不能把这个理论与实际情况很好地结合起来，甚至产生了悲观失望的消极情绪。事实上，经过几年来一系列的艰苦工作，已经取得了成绩和经验，特别是在农业合作化的基础上，去冬今春扩大了水浇地五百余万亩，控制了水土流失面积一万四千余平方公里。全省五百五十个干旱乡中的一百○三个，基本上摆脱了干旱威胁。拿榆中县高崖乡来说，一九五三年全乡平均三人只有一分水地，百分之八十的农户缺粮，现在，每人已有近一亩水浇地，户户有了余粮。这些生动的事实，使我们对认识和改变甘肃的自然面貌，增强了信心。但是，有些人却产生了另一种思想，认为改造自然是轻而易举的工作，忽视了它是一个长期、复杂、艰巨的任务，企图把十二年的事情在几年内去完成。这种急躁情绪与消极等待思想，同样都是片面的，主观主义的，都需要加以克服。
    依靠群众力量改变自然面貌
    充分利用水利资源，改变自然面貌，如果不依靠千百万人民的力量和智慧，那是不能想像的。因此，我们必须依靠群众，群众是力量的源泉，他们在与自然长期斗争中积累了极其丰富的经验。例如：清朝嘉庆年间，在大旱情况下，有人从鼠洞口沙堆上发现了生长茂盛的麦子，意识到铺砂可以抗旱，于是创造了铺砂田的办法。经科学家研究这种砂田，渗透率大，蒸发量小，有抗热、保墒、保温、压碱等好处，比同样土地产量高一至三倍，成熟期早十天到半月，深受群众欢迎，直到现在还是干旱地区群众和干旱作斗争的一种有效办法。解放后，河西群众和干部，为了克服渠道渗漏，创造了用卵石补砌渠道。这种卵石补砌的渠道，经过流水中的细沙、小石冲灌和水的渗压作用，日久便自行硬化，有很强的抗冲、抗冻和防漏作用。同时，工程技术简单，可以就地取材，工程造价比用沥青和洋灰要低数倍至十倍。类似事例，还很不少。对这些来自群众中的宝贵经验，只要我们能够经常注意把它集中起来，坚持下去，经过实践，再集中起来，再坚持下去，就可以使我们在改造自然的斗争中取得不断的胜利。特别是在农业合作化的基础上，充分发挥群众的集体智慧和力量就会取得更大的成绩。当然，依靠群众，必须与爱护群众力量、保持群众积极性相结合，必须使群众目前利益与长远利益相结合。要求过急、任务过大、只顾长远利益不照顾目前利益的作法，都是脱离实际，脱离群众的。今年春季我们给下边分配的水利、水土保持任务有些过大、过急，下面又层层追加，以致在某些地方曾发生过相当严重的强迫命令和放松农副业生产的现象，这是值得我们记取的教训。
    必须贯彻执行“全面规划，加强领导”的方针
    兴修水利、改变自然面貌，是需要各方面紧密结合的综合性工作。因此，必须贯彻执行“全面规划，加强领导”的方针。在具体措施中必须注意，上下游用水相结合，工农业用水相结合，大中小工程相结合，蓄水排水相结合，水土保持与水利工程相结合。如果对这些问题注意不够，各自为政、零敲碎打就会造成因小失大、顾此失彼的恶果。
    几年来党中央和国务院给我们的指导和各方面的支持鼓励是很大的，但是我们觉得中央有关部门的负责同志到甘肃去的少了一些，对甘肃具体情况还了解不够。因此，在解决某些具体问题时，就难免有些处理不当，和不够及时的现象。今后除了我们要及时系统地反映情况外，请中央有关部门也能给我们更多的指导和帮助。
