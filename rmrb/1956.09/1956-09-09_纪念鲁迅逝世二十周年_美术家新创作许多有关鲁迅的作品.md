    To commemorate the 20th anniversary of Lu Xun's death, artists in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places are creating many new works.

    The Beijing Lu Xun Museum, which is currently under construction, recently received newly created woodcuts from woodcut artists across the country. These creations include portraits of Lu Xun, depictions of events from Lu Xun's life, landscapes of Lu Xun's hometown, and illustrations for Lu Xun's works, including Li Hua's "Lu Xun at the Woodcut Training Class," Huang Yongyu's "Lu Xun Discussing Käthe Kollwitz's Woodcuts with Young Woodcut Artists," Zhao Yannian's "Lu Xun Delivering a Protest Letter to the German Consulate," Zhao Zongzao's "Lu Xun and Mao Dun Drafting a Telegram to Congratulate the Victory of the Red Army's Long March," Gu Yuan's "Lu Xun's Hometown," Gu Bingxin's illustrations for Lu Xun's novel "Medicine," Yan Han's and Ren Feng's "Portraits of Lu Xun," Zhang Huaijiang's "Lu Xun and Fang Zhimin Series," as well as over thirty works by new and veteran woodcut artists such as Yefu, Wang Qi, Wozha, Yang Keyang, Shao Keping, Huang Yan, Xia Ziyi, Liu Jian'an, Rong Ge, Xiao Lin, Li Tianxin, and Zhao Zongqi.

    Oil painters and traditional Chinese painters are also creating new oil paintings and ink wash paintings for the Lu Xun Museum. Wu Zuoren's ink wash painting "Lu Xun and Li Dazhao" will be completed in late September. Ai Zhongxin is revising his oil painting "Lu Xun and Youth," and Li Zongjin's "Lu Xun and Qu Qiubai," Liu Jiyou's "Illustrations for Old Tales Retold," as well as works by Zong Qixiang, Li Binghong, Sha Gengsi, and Jiang Zhaohe, have been sent to the Chinese Artists Association.

    Sculptors Xiao Chuanjiu, Zhang Songhe, Wang Bingzhao, Xie Jiasheng, and Zheng Ke have successively completed the creation of Lu Xun busts, Lu Xun heads, and Lu Xun reliefs. Folk artist Pan Yuchen's "Lu Xun Hometown Figure Statues" (Qingtian stone carvings) have also been sent to Beijing.

    These creations were commissioned by the Chinese Artists Association on behalf of the Lu Xun Museum. Some of these works will be displayed in the Lu Xun Museum. To create these works, painters such as Gu Yuan, Zhao Yannian, and Yang Keyang went to Lu Xun's hometown to experience life. During the creation process, the artists also received enthusiastic help from Lu Xun's widow, Xu Guangping, and writers Feng Xuefeng and Xia Yan.
