Comrade Cai Chang, First Secretary of the Women's Work Committee of the CPC Central Committee, made a speech:

    I fully agree with the reports made by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping on behalf of the Central Committee. Now I would like to express some opinions on the issue of cultivating and promoting female cadres.

    Our Party has adopted the policy of patiently cultivating, boldly using, and daringly promoting female cadres. In the report of the Central Committee of the Party on the revision of the Party Constitution, it is particularly pointed out: "The Party must cultivate and promote women cadres with great determination, and help and encourage them to move forward continuously, because they are one of the largest sources of the Party's cadres." In the face of the great task of socialist construction, the Party Central Committee has placed the issue of cultivating and promoting female cadres in such an important position, which I think is very appropriate and must be vigorously implemented in future work.

    In the various periods of our country's revolution, our Party has cultivated and promoted a large number of female cadres from among working-class and peasant women and intellectual women. In various tasks in the revolutionary base areas, in underground work and open and legal struggles in the reactionary ruling areas, these female cadres connected with the masses, worked hard, and fought heroically, playing a backbone role in the revolutionary cause.

    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our Party and the state have cultivated and promoted more female cadres, and their number is increasing year by year. In 1951, there were about 150,000 female cadres in various work posts across the country, accounting for 8 percent of the total number of cadres. By the end of 1955, this had increased to more than 764,000, accounting for 14.5 percent of the total number of cadres. In the great upsurge of the socialist revolution, thousands upon thousands of new women activists have emerged, and some of them have been promoted to cadres. All these female cadres are distributed in various work posts of the Party and the state. Under the care and education of the Party and the state, and through the practice of actual work, they have gradually improved their political consciousness and working ability. The vast majority of them have been conscientious, learning while working, and have completed the tasks entrusted to them by the Party and the state. Some of them have already mastered their own business and are familiar with a certain construction work they are in charge of. Currently there are three main problems:

    (1) The proportion of female cadres in the total number of cadres is still relatively small, and even fewer hold leadership positions;

    (2) The cultural, scientific, and theoretical level of most female cadres is relatively low, and their professional knowledge and skills are not high;

    (3) The burden of childcare and housework has increased.

    However, the increase in the number of female cadres still cannot keep up with the needs of the rapid development of socialist construction. The main problems at present are three: (1) Although the number of female cadres has increased, the proportion they account for in the total number of cadres is small; and there are even fewer leading cadres and scientific and technical personnel. Women account for only 6 percent of the total number of cadres at or above the county and section chief level nationwide; women account for only 3 percent of cadres at or above the bureau level; and women account for only 2.8 percent of city and county heads. As far as engineering and technical personnel are concerned, in the central-level organs and their affiliated enterprises, female engineering and technical personnel account for only 9 percent of the total, and female engineers account for only 0.8 percent of the total. (2) The working ability of female cadres has improved compared to the past, but the cultural, scientific, and theoretical level of most people is relatively low, and their professional knowledge and skills are not high. Although the old cadres have certain experience in struggle, they are unfamiliar with the current construction business. (3) Under the conditions of peaceful construction, the children and housework of most female cadres have increased, and their work and study are more intense than in the past. Although the children's care and social service undertakings have greatly developed, they still cannot keep up with the needs. Therefore, the contradiction between female cadres' participation in work and study and the education of children and housework is more prominent than in the past.

    The existence of these problems has certain social and historical roots. Due to our country's economic and cultural backwardness, women have long suffered from feudal constraints, and thus the opportunities for women to participate in social labor and receive education, and the conditions for developing women's and children's welfare undertakings have been greatly restricted. Since liberation, this situation has changed greatly, but it cannot be fundamentally changed in a short period of time. On the other hand, our subjective efforts are also insufficient. In terms of leadership, some leading organs and leaders underestimate the strength and active role of female cadres in the cause of revolution and construction, and have not been able to consciously and systematically cultivate and promote them in light of the special characteristics of female cadres, nor have they tried their best to solve the unique difficulties of female cadres by using possible conditions, but often let them drift. In individual organs and individual leaders, there are even ideas and behaviors that discriminate against and underestimate female cadres. They think that "three women are not as good as one man." When promoting female cadres, there are endless worries: they are afraid that female cadres will not be able to do the job when they are promoted, they are afraid that female cadres will not be able to persist in their work, and they are afraid that female cadres will get married and have children, which will increase the "burden" of the organs. Therefore, for male and female cadres with equal abilities, they often promote more men and fewer women. In individual units, there is even such a phenomenon that women are more likely to be elected as model cadres by the masses, but fewer women are promoted. These are all reflections of the residual ideas of male chauvinism in the old society in the implementation of cadre policies. In addition, from the perspective of female cadres themselves, there are also a few female cadres who, in the environment of peaceful construction, do not strive to work hard and move forward continuously; but are content with the status quo, do not seek progress, and are timid in the face of new tasks and new difficulties, which is also an important factor in their slow progress.

    Three Suggestions for Future Work

    In order to cultivate and promote more and better female cadres and give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity in the cause of socialist construction, I would like to make the following three suggestions:

    First, we must systematically cultivate Party and non-Party female cadres, continuously improve their socialist consciousness, help them study Marxism-Leninism, help them learn professional knowledge and skills, and try our best to stabilize them in their original work positions, encourage them to delve into their business, persist in their work, and transform from laymen to experts.

    There are very few female experts at present. In addition to striving to train a large number of new young cadres, we must also care for and cherish female cadres who already have certain specialized knowledge and technology, guide them to delve into their business, and support them in overcoming difficulties, further study and improve, and gradually become experts. When universities and scientific research institutions recruit students and graduate students, they should appropriately increase the proportion of female students.

    We should warmly care for female cadres with low cultural levels and older ages, and systematically help them learn culture and improve their business, and create conditions for them to work better.

    We must also cultivate and promote female cadres of various ethnic groups in various tasks according to the characteristics of ethnic minorities.

    Second, we must continue to boldly promote Party and non-Party female cadres to various work posts and leadership positions in accordance with the cadre policy of "both virtue and talent." To achieve this, the key lies in paying attention to using them boldly and providing regular training and education for them. Leading organs at all levels, especially the departments in charge of managing cadres, must carefully assign appropriate work to female cadres according to their specific circumstances and give them opportunities to exercise. In work, they should be educated and helped regularly. Their achievements should be encouraged to help them improve. Their shortcomings or mistakes should be corrected in time. In this way, excellent cadres will continue to grow, and the female cadres who have already been promoted can satisfactorily complete their work tasks. Comrade Mao Zedong said that cadres should be "allowed to do it, and learn from the lessons in the process and increase their talents. In this way, a large number of outstanding people will be produced." This is the most important principle for cultivating and promoting cadres, and it is especially important for female cadres.

    In the cause of socialist construction, there are jobs suitable for women in all walks of life, and female cadres can be cultivated and promoted in all of them. In the work of culture, education, medical care, health, childcare, trade, light industry, and political and legal affairs, the number of existing female cadres is the largest, which proves that these jobs are suitable for female cadres to undertake, so the leaders of these departments should cultivate more female cadres.

    Third, regarding the contradiction between participating in work and study and educating children and doing housework, this is a problem that most female cadres deeply feel distressed about. We Communists must be deeply concerned about this difficulty and gradually find ways to solve it. Lenin once said: "The proletariat cannot achieve complete freedom unless it strives for complete freedom for women." Therefore, Communists must not discriminate against or underestimate female cadres, and must not regard female cadres getting married and having children as a "burden," but should take the responsibility of protecting women and children and helping female cadres solve their difficulties, so that they can continue to move forward.

    I suggest that relevant units in all localities actively organize various types of childcare organizations according to needs and possibilities, and improve their operations and reduce fees in accordance with the principle of "running the school diligently and thriftily" to increase the number of children admitted. In cities or industrial areas, we must also appropriately develop social service undertakings, such as increasing public canteens and laundries, in order to gradually meet the requirements of female cadres to entrust children to care and reduce housework. At the same time, we must also carry out propaganda and explanation work to female cadres so that they can understand that our women's and children's welfare and social service undertakings can only be gradually developed along with the development of economic construction. We should help relevant leading organs from the positive side to gradually organize women's and children's welfare and social service undertakings according to actual possibilities. It is impossible to just complain about the leadership or make demands that are too high or too urgent. Moreover, female cadres themselves should also be good at organizing family members, dividing labor, and cooperating in managing housework and educating children. The leadership should take care of the situation of female cadres as much as possible and give them time and conditions.

    In addition, we must attach importance to the desire of the vast number of male and female cadres and the people to take appropriate measures to control fertility. In March 1955, the Party Central Committee issued instructions on controlling fertility, in which it was clearly stated: "Controlling fertility is a major policy issue related to the lives of the broad masses of people. Under the current historical conditions, for the benefit of the country, the family, and the new generation, our Party is in favor of appropriately controlling fertility." In Comrade Zhou Enlai's report this time, the issue of appropriately controlling fertility was raised again, which I think is completely correct and should be resolutely implemented. It is in line with China's actual situation to publicize and guide fertility control among the vast number of cadres and the people; they can adjust the density of fertility according to their own conditions and wishes and have children in a planned way. This practice is of great benefit to women's health, children's education, family life, and national prosperity. It is required that Party committees at all levels strengthen leadership, comprehensively plan, and formulate plans for cultivating and promoting female cadres.

    In order to solve the problem of cultivating and promoting female cadres well, and to ensure that the above-mentioned tasks are carried out smoothly, the key lies in the fact that Party committees at all levels can strengthen leadership and comprehensively plan. Some Party committees have already made overall arrangements for male and female cadres, paid attention to the special characteristics and special difficulties of female cadres, and formulated specific plans and implementation steps for cultivating and promoting female cadres, which are part of the entire cadre plan, and assigned relevant units to divide labor and cooperate to jointly implement it. All those who have done so have discovered the potential strength of female cadres, cultivated and promoted a large number of female cadres, and overcome the difficulty of the lack of sources of cadres. Therefore, the state of laissez-faire and the phenomenon of discrimination and underestimation of female cadres in the work of cultivating and promoting female cadres in some units should be corrected.

    Another important factor in the growth and progress of female cadres lies in their own efforts. Under the Party's cultivation and education, every female cadre should constantly improve her sense of socialist enterprise, persist in learning, persist in work, closely contact the masses, humbly learn from the masses, strengthen mutual unity, and train herself to be stronger by overcoming difficulties.

    There are shortcomings in the leadership of women's work. I agree with Comrade Deng Yingchao's self-criticism of our work in her speech. In the future, we must conscientiously study the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, as well as the documents of this conference, "go deep into the masses and do not advocate empty talk" (Mao Zedong), conscientiously correct shortcomings, and vigorously promote women's work. Support and care for the growth and development of female cadres to meet the needs of socialist construction. I firmly believe that in the increasingly developing socialist cause, the Party will continue to cultivate a large number of new female cadres with "both virtue and talent," and continue to help them fully contribute their strength to building a great socialist motherland.

    积极培养和提拔更多更好的女干部
    中共中央妇女工作委员会第一书记　蔡畅同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、邓小平同志代表中央委员会所作的报告。我现在就培养和提拔女干部问题，发表一些意见。
    我们党对女干部是采取耐心培养、放手使用和大胆提拔的方针的。这次党中央委员会的关于修改党章的报告中特别指出：“党必须用很大的决心培养和提拔妇女干部，帮助和鼓励她们不断前进，因为她们是党的干部的最大的来源之一。”在社会主义建设的伟大任务面前，党中央委员会把培养和提拔女干部问题放到这样重要的位置，我认为是十分恰当的，一定要在今后工作中努力贯彻执行。
    在我国革命的各个时期，我们党已经从工农劳动妇女和知识妇女中，培养和提拔了大批女干部。在革命根据地的各种工作中，在反动统治区域的地下工作和公开合法的斗争中，这批女干部联系群众，艰苦工作，英勇奋斗，在革命事业中发挥了骨干作用。
    从中华人民共和国成立以来，我们党同国家又培养和提拔了更多的女干部，她们的数量正在逐年增加。一九五一年在全国各种工作岗位上的女干部约有十五万人，占干部总数的百分之八，到一九五五年年底已增至七十六万四千余人，占干部总数的百分之十四点五。在伟大的社会主义革命高潮中，又涌现了成千成万的新的妇女积极分子，其中又有一批人被提拔为干部。所有这些女干部，都分布在党和国家的各种工作岗位上，她们在党和国家的关怀和教育下，经过实际工作的锻炼，逐步提高了政治觉悟和工作能力；绝大多数人兢兢业业，边作边学，完成了党和国家付托的任务；有一批人已经掌握了本身的业务，熟悉了她们所担任的某一项建设工作。当前存在的三个主要问题：
    （一）在全体干部中，女干部占的比重仍比较小，担任领导工作的更少；
    （二）大部分女干部的文化、科学、理论水平比较低，业务知识和技能不高；
    （三）子女和家务工作加重了。
    但是女干部的这种增长的情况，仍然跟不上社会主义建设迅速发展的需要；当前的主要问题有三个：（1）女干部的数量虽然有所增加，但是在全体干部中占的比重较小；而其中领导干部和科学技术人才更少。在全国相当于县、科长以上的干部中，妇女仅占总数的百分之六；在相当于司局长以上的干部中，妇女仅占总数的百分之三；在市、县长中妇女仅占百分之二点八。就工程技术人员来说，在中央一级机关和所属企业中，女工程技术人员仅占总数的百分之九，女工程师仅占总数的百分之零点八。（2）女干部的工作能力，比过去来说，有所提高，但大部分人的文化、科学、理论水平比较低，业务知识和技能不高。老的干部虽然有一定的斗争经验，但她们对当前的建设业务是生疏的。（3）在和平建设的条件下，绝大部分女干部的子女和家务增多了，工作、学习比过去紧张了。儿童保育事业和社会服务事业，虽然有很大发展，但还跟不上需要。因而女干部参加工作、学习同教养子女、操作家务之间的矛盾，比过去更为突出。
    这些问题的存在，是有一定的社会历史根源的。由于我国经济、文化落后，妇女长期遭受封建束缚，因而妇女参加社会劳动和受教育的机会，发展妇女儿童福利事业的条件，都受到很大限制。解放以来，这种情况虽然有了极大的改变，但终究不是短时期内可以根本改变的。另一方面，我们主观努力也有不够的地方。在领导上，有些领导机关和领导人员对女干部在革命和建设事业中的力量和积极作用估计不足，没有能针对女干部的特长，有意识有计划地加以培养提拔，对女干部特有的困难，也没有尽量利用可能的条件，切实加以解决，而往往任其自流。在个别机关和个别领导人员中，甚至有歧视、轻视女干部的思想和行为，他们认为“三女不顶一男”。在提拔女干部的时候，存在着无穷的忧虑：他们怕女干部提拔起来干不了，怕女干部不能坚持工作，怕女干部结婚生孩子，增加机关工作的“负担”。因而对有同等能力的男女干部，往往多提拔男的，少提拔女的。在个别单位里竟有这种现象，被群众选为模范干部的，女多于男，而被提拔的，女的却很少。这些都是旧社会的重男轻女的残余思想在执行干部政策中的反映。此外，从女干部本身来说，也还有少数女干部，在和平建设的环境中，不是奋发努力，不断前进；而是安于现状，不求进步，在新的任务和新的困难面前，裹足不前，这也是她们进步不快的重要因素。
    对今后工作的三点建议
    为了培养和提拔更多更好的女干部，在社会主义建设事业中充分发挥她们的积极性和创造性，特提出下列三点建议：
    第一，要有系统地培养党和非党的女干部，不断地提高她们的社会主义觉悟，帮助她们学习马克思列宁主义，帮助她们学习业务知识和技能，尽可能让她们在原有的工作岗位上稳定下来，鼓励她们深钻业务，坚持工作，由外行变成内行。
    现有的女专家极少，除应该努力培养大量的新的青年干部外，对已经具备一定专门知识和技术的女干部，更要关怀和爱护，引导她们钻进去，支持她们克服困难，深造提高，逐步成为专家。高等学校、科学研究机关招收学生和研究生的时候，应该适当增加女生的比例。
    对于文化低、年龄较大的女干部，应该热情地关怀她们，有计划地帮助她们学习文化，提高业务，创造条件使她们能够更好地工作。
    还要根据兄弟民族的特点，在各种工作中，培养和提拔各民族的女干部。
    第二，要继续根据“德才兼备”的干部政策，大胆提拔党和非党的女干部，到各种工作岗位和各级领导岗位上去。要做到这一点，关键在于平时注意对她们放手使用和经常的培养教育。各级领导机关特别是管理干部的部门，要细心地根据女干部的具体情况，分配她们适当的工作，给予锻炼的机会。在工作中，经常加以教育和帮助，对于她们的成就，应该加以鼓励，帮助她们提高。对于她们的缺点或错误，及时教育她们改正。这样，优秀的干部就会不断地生长起来，已经提拔起来的女干部就能胜任愉快地完成工作任务。毛泽东同志说过，对于干部，“要让他们做，在做的中间得到教训，增长才干。这样，大批的优秀人物就会产生。”这是培养提拔干部的最重要的原则，对女干部尤其重要。
    在社会主义建设事业中，各行各业都有适合妇女做的工作，都可以培养和提拔女干部。而在文化、教育、医务、卫生、保育、贸易、轻工业和政法等方面的工作，现有女干部的人数最多，证明这些工作是适合女干部来担负的，因而这些部门的领导上应多培养女干部。
    第三，关于参加工作、学习同教养子女、操作家务的矛盾，这是多数女干部深感苦恼的问题。我们共产党人对于这种困难，一定要亲切地关怀，逐步设法解决。列宁曾经说：“无产阶级要不为妇女争取到完全的自由，它就不能获得完全的自由”。所以共产党人决不能歧视、轻视女干部，不能把女干部结婚生孩子当作“负担”，而应负起保护妇女儿童，帮助女干部解决困难，使她们不断前进的责任。
    我建议各地方的各有关单位，根据需要和可能，积极举办各种类型的托儿组织，并根据“勤俭办所”的方针，改进业务，减低收费标准，增收儿童。在城市或工业区还要适当发展社会服务事业，如增设公共饭堂，洗衣房等，以便逐步满足女干部托养子女，减轻家务劳动的要求。同时我们还要向女干部进行宣传解释工作，使她们了解到我们的妇女儿童福利和社会服务事业，只能随着经济建设的发展而逐步发展起来，我们应该根据实际可能，从积极方面帮助有关领导机关，逐步把妇女儿童福利和社会服务事业举办起来，单只埋怨领导，或提出过高过急的要求，是行不通的。而且女干部本身还应善于组织家庭成员，分工合作料理家务和教养子女。领导方面应尽量照顾女干部的这种情况，给她们时间和条件。
    此外，我们必须重视广大男女干部和人民群众要求采取适当的办法节制生育的愿望。在一九五五年三月党中央就颁发了有关节制生育的指示，在这个指示里明确提出：“节制生育是关系广大人民生活的一项重大政策性的问题。在当前的历史条件下，为了国家、家庭和新生一代的利益，我们党是赞成适当地节制生育的。”这次周恩来同志的报告中，又再度提出适当地节制生育问题，我认为是完全正确的，应当坚决执行。在广大干部和人民群众中宣传、指导节制生育，是符合我国实际情况的；他们可以根据自己的条件和愿望，调节生育密度，有计划地生育。这种做法，对妇女健康、儿童教养、家庭生活和民族繁荣都是有很大的好处。要求各级党委加强领导，全面规划，制订培养和提拔妇女干部的计划
    为了很好地解决女干部的培养和提拔问题，要使以上各项工作顺利进行，关键在于各级党委能加强领导，全面规划。现在已经有些党委，对男女干部作了统筹安排，注意女干部的特长和特殊困难，制订了培养和提拔女干部的具体计划和实施步骤，作为整个干部规划的一部分，责成有关单位，分工合作，共同贯彻。凡是这样作的，都发掘了女干部的潜在力量，培养和提拔了大批的女干部，克服了干部来源缺少的困难。因此，现在某些单位培养和提拔女干部工作中的自流状态和歧视轻视女干部的现象，应予纠正。
    女干部成长和进步的另一个重要因素，是在于她们自身的努力，在党的培养教育之下，每一个女干部都应该不断提高自己的社会主义事业心，坚持学习，坚持工作，密切联系群众，虚心向群众学习，加强相互团结，从克服困难中，把自己锻炼得更加坚强。
    在妇女工作领导方面是有缺点的，我同意邓颖超同志发言中对我们的工作所作的检查。今后我们一定要认真学习党中央和毛泽东同志的指示以及这次大会的文件，“深入群众，不尚空谈”（毛泽东），认真改正缺点，大力推进妇女工作。支持和关心女干部的成长和发展，以适应社会主义建设的需要。我深信在社会主义事业日益发展中，党必将不断地培养出大批新的“德才兼备”的女干部，不断地帮助她们为建设伟大的社会主义祖国充分贡献自己的力量。
