    Xiao Wu's Wedding
    Luo Xiaozhi
    The comrades in our section had long heard that Xiao Wu had a fiancée who taught at a junior high school in Hankou. Xiao Wu's love letters were always kept secret. One day in early July, he suddenly made a newly arrived love letter public. The section chief took one look and said, "This is a good thing!" The letter said: "After the school summer vacation, she will come to Chengdu to get married, it will take about seven or eight days." The comrades busied themselves with preparing Xiao Wu's wedding. The section chief recommended himself to be the officiant. At his command: the male comrades negotiated with the administration section for a house, and the female comrades were responsible for decorating the new house. Everyone was busy. Xiao Wu usually loved to talk and laugh, but at this time he didn't talk much, and even blushed at every turn. On Sunday, the comrades tidied up the new house neatly; the second Sunday, everyone accompanied Xiao Wu to the street to buy all the things needed for the wedding, just waiting for the bride.
    On the 17th, the bride sent an airmail letter from Yichang. She said that she had been in Yichang for four or five days, and it was difficult to buy a boat ticket. The journey might be delayed for a few more days, and she told Xiao Wu not to worry.
    Time flies, in a blink of an eye it was another ten days. The section chief said: "Xiao Wu, does the bride dislike me as the officiant, why hasn't she come yet?" In fact, Xiao Wu was more anxious than anyone else. He scratched the back of his head, frowned, and made a helpless look, even saying: "Has she changed her mind?"
    Near the end of July, she finally wrote a letter, which said: "I have been waiting for a boat in Yichang for half a month. I don't know when I can leave. There are too many passengers waiting for the boat. Is there anything you can do?" Xiao Wu stared blankly without saying a word. At this time, someone suggested taking a route from Yichang, via Hankou, Xi'an to Chengdu, which would take at most ten days, and she would definitely arrive before August 10th. Xiao Wu also agreed to this method, immediately sent a telegram, and remitted eighty yuan for travel expenses. Sure enough, on August 7th, the bride sent an airmail letter from Xi'an, saying that she had arrived in Xi'an and was waiting for a car to Baoji.
    Unexpectedly, August 10th passed, and the bride had not yet arrived. In those days, Xiao Wu rode his bicycle to the train station after dinner, waiting for the train from Guangyuan, and always came back with his head down. Just when Xiao Wu was anxious, the bride wrote another letter:
    There are more passengers waiting for the car in Baoji than in Yichang. I heard that there are one or two thousand people, and the hotels are full. I share a single bed with a female comrade. I always think like this, once I buy a ticket, I will immediately send you a telegram, the telegram draft has been crumpled in my pocket. Today is already August 15th. I think even if I wait three or two more days to buy a ticket, I will not be able to arrive in Chengdu until after the 20th. After the wedding, the transportation is so inconvenient, and the school starts on September 1st, how can I rush back? What's more, I have to prepare my lessons before school starts. Therefore, I decided to return to Hankou tomorrow, please forgive me....

    小吴的婚事
    罗小志
    我们科里的同志早就听说小吴有个未婚妻，在汉口一所初级中学里教书。小吴的情书向来是保密的，7月初有一天，他忽然把刚来的一封情书公开了，科长一看，说“好事呀”。信上说：“学校放暑假以后，她就来成都结婚，大约走七八天就到了。”同志们张罗着给小吴办喜事。科长自我推荐，要当主婚人，他一声令下：男同志找行政科交涉房子，女同志负责布置新房。大家忙个不休。小吴平时爱说爱笑，这时不多讲话了，动不动还害臊呢。星期天，同志们把新房布置得整整齐齐；第二个星期天，大伙陪着小吴上街把结婚用的东西买个一应俱全，只等新娘子了。
    新娘子17日从宜昌来封航空信，她说到宜昌已经四五天了，船票不好买，路上可能多耽误几天，叫小吴不要着急。
    时间真快，一晃又是十几天，科长说：“小吴，新娘子是不是不喜欢我这个主婚人，怎么还不来？”其实小吴比谁都着急，他用手搔着后脑勺，皱起眉头，做出无可奈何的样子，甚至说：“是不是变卦啦？”
    快到7月底，她终于来信了，信上说：“在宜昌等了半个来月的船，那天能走，说不一定，等船的旅客太多，你有什么办法吗？”小吴直愣愣地不吭声，这时，有人建议从宜昌，走汉口，西安来成都，顶多走十天，8月10日以前一定能到。小吴也同意这个办法，马上发封电报，并且汇去八十元旅费。果然不错，新娘子8月7日从西安来封航空信，说她到了西安，正等车去宝鸡。
    不料8月10日过去了，新娘子还没有来，那几天小吴晚饭后就骑上自行车去火车站，等候从广元来的那趟列车，每次总是垂着头回来。小吴正在着急的时候，新娘子又来信了：
    在宝鸡等车的旅客比宜昌还多，听说有一两千人，旅馆都住满了，我跟一位女同志合伙睡在一张单人床上。我老是这样想，一旦买到车票，我马上给你拍一封电报，电报稿在口袋里都揉烂了。今天已经是8月15日了，我想就是再等三两天买到票，20日以后才能到成都。结婚以后，交通这么不方便，学校9月1日开学，我怎么能赶回去呢？何况开学前还要准备一下功课。因此，我决定明天回汉口，请你原谅……。
