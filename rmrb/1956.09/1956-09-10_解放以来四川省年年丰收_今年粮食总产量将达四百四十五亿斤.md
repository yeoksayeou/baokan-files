(Report from our Chengdu Bureau, 8th) Sichuan Province, whose grain output accounts for more than one-tenth of the country's total grain output, has achieved its seventh bumper harvest since liberation this year. The province's total grain output will reach more than 44.5 billion jin, an increase of more than 4 billion jin compared with the bumper year of 1955, and more than 8.5 billion jin over 1938, the highest grain output before liberation.

    This year, the rice planting area in Sichuan Province reached more than 53 million mu. Due to the large-scale promotion of double-cropping rice, the increase in production was particularly significant. Several million mu of early rice were all harvested in mid-August, with an average yield of about 500 jin per mu, equivalent to the yield of medium rice last year. Many areas even exceeded the level of medium rice production last year. Nearly 50 million mu of medium rice, with the exception of the Chengdu Plain in western Sichuan and remote mountainous areas that are currently being harvested intensively, were basically harvested in the plains and hilly areas of southern, eastern, and northern Sichuan in early September, generally increasing production by about 10% compared to last year. More than 5 million mu of rice in the Nanchong area of northern Sichuan, which had suffered from floods, also yielded an average of 550 to 600 jin per mu, an increase of more than 10% compared to last year. In Kai County in eastern Sichuan, the county's more than 550,000 mu of medium rice increased production by 15% compared to last year. In the Luzhou and Yibin areas of southern Sichuan, the yield per mu is generally also 500 to 600 jin. The more than 6 million mu of medium rice in the Chengdu Plain, a high-yielding rice area in western Sichuan, is also expected to increase production by an average of 7% compared to last year, increasing rice production by more than 220 million jin.

    The province's more than 24 million mu of corn have also been harvested. Although some mountainous areas in northern Sichuan suffered from floods and droughts, resulting in a slight decrease in corn production, the province's corn output is still slightly higher than last year's level. More than 23 million mu of potato crops (mainly sweet potatoes) are generally growing very well due to the widespread promotion of advanced technologies such as warm-bed seedling cultivation and early planting with close spacing, and will achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest. According to estimates from various regions, the average increase in production is expected to be more than 20%. The sweet potatoes of the Hongqi Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Zhoukou Township, Peng'an County, currently weigh 1.5 jin per plant. According to members of the cooperative, by the end of September, when harvested, each plant can produce about 3 jin of sweet potatoes, and each mu can produce more than 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes.

    The more than 4.5 million mu of late rice and more than 3 million mu of late autumn crops planted in various regions are now generally growing well. The late rice in the Luzhou, Yibin, and Jiangjin areas, where the season is earlier, is currently budding and flowering, with each head generally bearing more than 100 grains. If there are no special disasters in the future, it is estimated that these two items, late rice and late autumn crops, can increase grain production by more than 1 billion jin.

    解放以来四川省年年丰收
    今年粮食总产量将达四百四十五亿斤
    本报成都8日电　粮食产量占全国粮食总产量十分之一以上的四川省，今年又获得了解放以来的第七次丰收，全省粮食产量将达到四百四十五亿多斤，比丰收的1955年增加四十亿多斤，超过解放前粮食产量最高的1938年八十五亿多斤。
    四川省今年的水稻种植面积达五千三百多万亩，由于在较大面积上推广了双季稻，增产特别多。几百万亩早稻在8月中旬已全部收完，每亩平均收了五百斤左右，相当于去年中稻的产量，不少地区还超过了去年中稻产量的水平。近五千万亩中稻除川西平原和边远山区目前正在紧张收割外，川南、川东、川北的平坝和丘陵地区在9月初已基本收完，一般都比去年增产一成左右。曾经遭受洪水灾害的川北南充专区的五百多万亩水稻，每亩平均也收了五百五十斤到六百斤，比去年增产一成多。川东的开县，全县五十五万多亩中稻，比去年增产了15％。川南的泸州、宜宾等专区，每亩产量一般也在五、六百斤。水稻高产区的川西平原的六百多万亩中稻，平均也可比去年增产7％，将增产稻谷二亿二千多万斤。
    全省的二千四百多万亩玉米也已收完，虽然川北的部分山区遭受了洪水灾害和旱灾，玉米略有减产，但全省玉米产量仍稍高于去年的水平。二千三百多万亩薯类作物（主要是红薯），由于普遍推广了温床育苗和早栽密植等先进技术，目前一般都长得很好，将获得空前丰收。据各地估产，平均可增产两成以上。蓬安县周口乡红旗高级农业社的红薯，目前每窝已有一斤半重，据该社社员谈，到9月底收获时，每窝可结红薯三斤左右，每亩能产红薯一万多斤。
    各地栽种的四百五十多万亩晚稻和三百多万亩晚秋作物，现在一般也生长良好。季节较早的泸州、宜宾、江津等专区的晚稻正在含苞吐穗，每吊一般结谷子一百多颗。今后如无特殊灾害，估计晚稻和晚秋作物这两项共可增产十亿多斤粮食。
