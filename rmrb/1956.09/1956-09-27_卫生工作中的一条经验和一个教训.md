One Experience and One Lesson in Health Work
Speech by Comrade Xu Yunbei, Vice Minister of Health

I fully agree with the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping.

Now I will talk about one relatively successful experience and one serious lesson in our health work.

Relying on the masses and launching the Patriotic Health Campaign is a relatively successful experience

What is a relatively successful experience in China's health work over the past few years? As everyone knows, since 1952, a vigorous Patriotic Health Campaign has been launched throughout the country. The broad masses of workers, peasants, students, urban residents, youth, and children were involved in this movement, participating in activities such as catching flies, eliminating mosquitoes, digging out pupae, filling in stinking ditches, cleaning streets, and improving environmental sanitation. As a result, flies and mosquitoes were greatly reduced, the incidence of diseases was significantly lowered, the health level of the broad masses of people was improved, and social customs were changed, while at the same time the enemy's germ warfare was smashed. The gains of this movement were enormous, and many international friends considered it a miracle. Why was this movement able to achieve such great success? This was mainly because, under the leadership of the Party and government at all levels, the masses were fully relied upon and mobilized, and health work was closely integrated with mass movements. We adopted the working method of the mass line in this movement, with the masses making their own plans, formulating covenants, launching competitions, and supervising and checking each other. Propaganda work was constantly carried out during the movement, educating the masses through typical examples; models were cultivated among the masses and banners were erected, so that key personnel were combined with the masses. At the same time, the work of grassroots health organizations was strengthened, and the activists who emerged from the mass movement were organized and consolidated. In this way, the Patriotic Health Campaign became a conscious and voluntary action of the broad masses, demonstrating inexhaustible power.

The combination of the Patriotic Health Campaign with the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and with the mass production movement and the work of strengthening fertilizer accumulation, was also an extremely important factor in generating tremendous power for the movement.

In carrying out mass health movements, we also emphasized the principle of combining health science and technology with mass movements. That is, on the one hand, fully developing the creativity of the masses, and on the other hand, developing the enthusiasm of scientific and technical personnel, so that the guidance of science and technology kept up with the development of the movement, and science and technology played its due role, thereby strengthening the confidence of the masses and better exerting the power of the masses. The application of this principle has also achieved remarkable results in the work of eliminating schistosomiasis in the past year.

We also had many shortcomings in the mass health movement, the main ones being that when the movement reached its climax, there was often a tendency towards formalism and commandism, and in general, leadership was often relaxed, forming a situation of laissez-faire, failing to combine it with the major tasks of the time and place, so that it was not regularized. At the same time, we also failed to summarize experiences in a timely manner, and failed to implement the policy of combining health work with mass movements in various health work according to local conditions and times. In the future, we must learn from experience, overcome shortcomings, and enable mass health movements to play a greater role in the future struggle to eliminate the four pests and eliminate the diseases that are most harmful to the people.

Making mistakes in guiding principles and policies on the issue of traditional Chinese medicine is a serious lesson

What is a serious lesson in health work over the past few years? That is, our health departments made mistakes in guiding principles and policies on the issue of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which caused major losses to the people's health cause.

As everyone knows, TCM is the main force upon which the broad masses rely for treating diseases. Traditional Chinese medicine has a history of thousands of years, with rich content and experience, not only of great practical value, but also of great research value. If we had resolutely implemented the Party's policies since the founding of the country in 1949, the strength of TCM could have been fully utilized, not only could TCM and Western medicine have been closely united to form a strong team of health workers, but also sound grassroots health organizations could have been organized, so that the large-scale Patriotic Health Campaign under the leadership of our Party could have been further supported by medical science and technology, and greater achievements could have been made in the struggle to eliminate and reduce diseases, and at the same time, new achievements could have been made in sorting out and developing traditional Chinese medicine. However, some leading comrades in our health departments did not implement the Party's policies, adopted an attitude of negating everything about traditional Chinese medicine, and adopted a policy of restricting and excluding TCM. This, as the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong correctly pointed out, is a reflection of extremely base bourgeois ideology. Individual leading comrades in the health departments had for a long time violated the Party's policies and resisted the Party's leadership, causing serious damage to the health cause. This is indeed a very painful lesson for all of us health workers.

Over the past year or so, under the care and supervision of the Central Committee and Party committees at all levels, after the health departments criticized the erroneous policies and erroneous ideas towards TCM, the Party's policies have been gradually implemented, TCM has begun to be valued, more than 10,000 TCM practitioners have participated in the work of national health institutions, the political status and economic life of TCM practitioners have been improved, and the enthusiasm and role of TCM practitioners have been enhanced. Along with the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, more than 50,000 cooperative joint clinics, health stations, township health centers and other grassroots health organizations have now been organized. Especially after the launch of Western medicine practitioners learning TCM, some Western medicine practitioners, through study, have initially grasped the basic theories of TCM, realized that traditional Chinese medicine does have valuable things, and have developed feelings for traditional Chinese medicine. The broad masses of Western medicine practitioners warmly support the Party's policies, and the vast majority express their willingness to learn TCM; some Western medicine experts have begun research work on TCM. A new situation has emerged in the unity of TCM and Western medicine.

Of course, our work in this area is still far from sufficient. The thinking of some health workers who despise TCM has not been completely reversed. Our work on TCM generally still remains at the stage of calls, lacking specific leadership and specific measures. We still lack investigation and research, and we are not good at summarizing experiences and promoting work in a timely manner. All of these, we should strive to correct, and strive to make up for the losses caused in the past in a not very long period of time, so that China's people's health cause can advance victoriously on the basis of close unity, mutual learning, and common improvement between TCM and Western medicine.

### 卫生工作中的一条经验和一个教训

    卫生工作中的一条经验和一个教训
    卫生部副部长　徐运北同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、邓小平同志的报告。
    现在我来谈谈我们卫生工作中一条比较成功的经验和一个严重的教训。
    依靠群众，开展爱国卫生运动，是一条比较成功的经验
    什么是几年来我国卫生工作中一条比较成功的经验呢？大家知道，从一九五二年开始，在我们全国范围内蓬蓬勃勃地开展了一个爱国卫生运动。广大的工人、农民、学生、市民、青年、儿童，被卷入了这个运动，他们参加捉苍蝇、灭蚊虫、挖蛹、填臭水坑、打扫街坊、改进环境卫生等等工作。结果，苍蝇、蚊子大大减少，疾病的发病率大大降低，提高了广大人民群众的卫生水平，起了移风易俗的作用，同时粉碎了敌人的细菌战。这个运动的收获是十分巨大的，不少国际友人认为这是一个奇迹。这个运动为什么能够得到这样大的成功呢？这主要是因为在各地党政的领导下，充分地依靠了群众，发动了群众，把卫生工作和群众运动密切地结合起来。我们在这一运动中采取了群众路线的工作方法，由群众自己做计划、订公约、发动竞赛、互相督促检查。在运动中不断地作宣传工作，通过典型事例，向群众进行教育；在群众中培养模范，树立旗帜，使骨干与群众相结合。同时加强基层卫生组织的工作，把从群众运动中涌现出来的积极分子组织起来，巩固下来。这样，爱国卫生运动就成为广大群众自觉自愿的行动，表现出无穷无尽的力量。
    爱国卫生运动和伟大的抗美援朝运动相结合，和群众的生产运动、加强积肥的工作相结合，也是使运动发生巨大力量的极其重要的因素。
    在开展群众性的卫生运动中，我们又强调了卫生科学技术与群众运动相结合的原则。即一方面充分发扬群众的创造性，另一方面发扬科学技术人员的积极性，使科学技术指导跟上运动的发展，使科学技术起到应有的作用，从而加强了群众的信心，更好地发挥了群众的力量。这个原则的运用，在最近一年来消灭血吸虫病的工作中也收到了显著的成效。
    我们在群众性卫生运动中，也是有许多缺点的，主要的就是当运动达到高潮时，往往出现形式主义和命令主义的偏向，在一般的情况下，又常常放松领导，形成放任自流，未能和当时当地的有关重大任务结合起来，使它经常化。同时，我们也没有及时地总结经验，把卫生工作与群众运动相结合的方针，因地因时制宜地贯彻到各项卫生工作中去。今后我们必须吸取经验，克服缺点，使群众性的卫生运动在今后除四害和消灭对人民危害最大的疾病的斗争中，发挥更大的作用。
    在中医问题上犯了方针政策上的错误，是一个严重的教训
    什么是几年来卫生工作中的一个严重教训呢？这就是我们卫生部门在中医问题上犯了方针政策上的错误，使人民卫生事业受到重大的损失。
    大家知道，中医是广大群众赖以治病的主要力量。祖国医学有几千年的历史，有丰富的内容和经验，不仅有极大的实用价值，而且有巨大的研究价值。假如在一九四九年建国以来我们就坚决地贯彻执行党的政策，中医的力量就可以得到充分发挥，不仅可以使中医和西医密切的团结，组成强大的卫生人员的队伍，而且可以组织起健全的基层卫生组织，使我党领导下的大规模的爱国卫生运动进一步得到医药科学技术的支援，在消灭和减少疾病的斗争中获得更大的成绩，同时也可以在整理和发扬祖国医学中获得新的成就。但是，我们卫生部门的一部分领导同志却不执行党的方针，对祖国医学采取否定一切的态度，对中医采取限制排斥的政策。这正如党中央、毛泽东同志所正确地指出的，是一种极端卑鄙的资产阶级思想的反映。卫生部门的个别领导同志曾经在长时期内违反党的政策，抗拒党的领导，以致卫生事业遭受了严重的损害。这对于我们全体卫生工作同志确是一个十分沉痛的教训。
    一年多来在中央和各级党委的关心和监督下，卫生部门批判了对待中医的错误方针和错误思想以后，党的政策已经逐步得到贯彻，中医开始受到重视，一万多名中医参加了国家卫生机构工作，中医的政治地位和经济生活有所改善，中医的积极性和作用提高了。伴随着农业合作化运动的发展，现在已经组织了五万多个合作社性质的联合诊所、保健站、乡卫生所等基层卫生组织。尤其是在开展了西医学习中医以后，一部分西医通过学习，初步地领会了中医的基本理论，认识了祖国医学确有宝贵的东西，对祖国医学发生了感情。广大西医是热烈拥护党的政策的，绝大多数表示愿意学习中医；有的西医专家开始了对中医的研究工作。中医和西医的团结已经出现了新的局面。
    当然，我们在这方面的工作还做得很不够。一部分卫生工作干部轻视中医的思想还没有彻底扭转。我们对中医的工作一般地还停留在号召阶段，缺乏具体领导和具体措施。我们还缺乏调查研究，还不善于及时总结经验，推动工作。所有这些，我们都应该努力改正，争取在不很长的时期内能够弥补过去所造成的损失，使我国的人民卫生事业在中西医亲密团结，互相学习，共同提高的基础上，胜利前进。
