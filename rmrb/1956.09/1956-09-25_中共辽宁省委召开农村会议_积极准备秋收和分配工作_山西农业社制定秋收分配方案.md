    CCP Liaoning Provincial Committee Convenes Rural Work Conference
    Actively Prepare for Autumn Harvest and Distribution
    Shanxi Agricultural Cooperatives Formulate Autumn Harvest Distribution Plans

    Xinhua News Agency Report: Liaoning Province's autumn fields will generally achieve a bumper harvest. According to surveys and trial distribution calculations from some agricultural production cooperatives, it is estimated that over 90% of cooperatives will increase production compared to last year, and that approximately 90% of the members of about 90% of the cooperatives will increase their income. In order to properly carry out the autumn harvest and distribution work, the Rural Work Department of the CCP Liaoning Provincial Committee recently convened a conference of production cooperation department heads from various regions (cities) and counties to specifically discuss this issue.

    The meeting held that this year is the first year of agricultural collectivization in Liaoning Province, and Party organizations at all levels in rural areas must conscientiously do a good job in distribution work.

    After analyzing the favorable and unfavorable conditions for this year's distribution work, the meeting discussed how to properly carry out this year's income distribution work. The meeting considered that the autumn harvest season has arrived, and all forces must be mobilized to carry out the harvest and strive for every grain to be stored. The meeting pointed out that in the specific implementation of income distribution work, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the principle of overall consideration of the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, and the cooperatives should conscientiously implement the policy of "deducting less and distributing more" to ensure that 90% of the members increase their income. The meeting emphasized that because advanced cooperatives account for the vast majority this year, implementing the principle of distribution according to work is the most important key to achieving reasonable income distribution. For this reason, it is currently necessary to carefully clear work records, correct unreasonable phenomena in labor remuneration, and appropriately care for "five guarantees" households such as the widowed, orphaned, elderly, weak, and disabled members during the autumn harvest.

    The meeting also pointed out the task of rectifying the cooperatives and the Party in conjunction with income distribution. Through rectification, thoroughly implement the principle of democratic management, summarize the superiority of cooperatives and the experiences and lessons of running cooperatives, improve members' ideological awareness and the management level of cooperatives, adjust labor organization, formulate production plans for this winter and next year, and promote winter production and preparations for increased production next year.

    Xinhua News Agency Report: 19,400 agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi Province are formulating autumn harvest distribution plans. After the CCP Yanbei Local Committee convened a rural work conference to study income distribution work, the entire region has entered the stage of understanding the situation, estimating production, and conducting trial calculations. Changzhi Special District is combining the formulation of distribution plans with clearing old accounts and comprehensively rectifying financial work in more than 4,000 agricultural cooperatives. Xinxian area is training accountants of agricultural cooperatives. 80% of agricultural cooperatives in Guoxian have already formulated full-year distribution plans.

    Many agricultural cooperatives, after discovering that the income of some members may decrease during trial calculations, are taking appropriate measures to improve their lives. In Yingxian, the income of 15% of agricultural cooperatives may decrease, and a large number of cadres have been sent to help members who may experience a decrease in income to increase their income. Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Jincheng County, which has suffered continuous waterlogging and wind disasters, found after trial calculation that the income of nearly one-fifth of its members had decreased. The cooperative management committee immediately mobilized members to strengthen the processing of autumn seedlings, replant more than 110 mu of vegetables, and also extracted a part of the labor force to engage in eleven kinds of sideline production such as picking mountain peaches, digging medicinal materials, and raising autumn silkworms. In this way, not only can the loss of production be compensated, but the income will exceed the full-year plan by more than 1,000 yuan, ensuring that 98% of the cooperative members can increase their income.

    While formulating distribution plans, agricultural cooperatives in various places have provided appropriate care for widowed, orphaned, and childless households. Liujiayu Agricultural Cooperative in Hequ County adopted a method combining agricultural cooperative contracting and state relief, which has significantly improved the lives of 22 widowed, orphaned, and childless members compared to last year.

    中共辽宁省委召开农村会议
    积极准备秋收和分配工作
    山西农业社制定秋收分配方案
    据新华社讯　辽宁省秋田将普遍获得丰收。根据一些农业生产合作社试算试分的调查，预计有90％以上的社可比去年增产；90％左右的社的90％以上的社员可增加收入。为了做好秋收和分配工作，中共辽宁省委农村工作部最近召开了各地（市）、县委生产合作部长会议，专门讨论了这一问题。
    会议认为：今年是辽宁省实现农业合作化的第一年，农村各级党的组织必须切实做好分配工作。
    会议在分析了今年分配工作的有利条件和不利条件之后，对于如何做好今年的收益分配工作进行了讨论。会议认为目前秋收季节已到，必须动员一切力量进行秋收，争取颗粒入仓。会议指出，在具体进行收益分配工作中，要切实贯彻执行国家、集体、个人三方面利益统筹兼顾的原则，合作社要认真执行“少扣多分”的政策，保证90％的社员增加收入。会议强调指出，由于今年高级社占绝大多数，贯彻执行按劳取酬的原则，是达到合理分配收益的最主要的关键。为此，目前必须认真清理工账，纠正劳动报酬上的不合理现象，对于孤寡老弱残疾社员等“五保”户，应当在秋收中予以适当照顾。
    会议还指出结合收益分配进行整社整党的任务。通过整社深入贯彻民主办社的原则，总结合作社的优越性和办社的经验教训，提高社员的思想觉悟和合作社的管理水平，调整劳动组织，制定今冬和明年的生产计划，把冬季生产和明年的增产准备工作推动起来。
    据新华社讯　山西省一万九千四百个农业社正在制订秋收分配方案。中共雁北地方委员会召开农村工作会议研究收益分配工作以后，全区已进入了解情况、估产和试算阶段。长治专区结合制定分配方案在四千多个农业社中清结旧账，全面整顿财务工作。忻县地区正训练农业社的会计。崞县80％的农业社已经制定出全年分配方案。
    不少农业社在试算中发现某些社员收入减少以后，采取适当的措施去改善他们的生活。应县有15％的农业社收入可能减少，现已派出大批干部帮助可能减少收入的社员增加收入。连续遭受涝害和风灾的晋城县光明农业社，经过试算发现近五分之一的社员收入减少，社管理委员会立即发动社员加强秋苗加工，补种了一百一十多亩蔬菜，还抽出一部分劳力从事采山桃、刨药材、养秋蚕等十一种副业生产。这样不但可以弥补起减产损失，收入还超过全年计划一千多元，保证了全社98％的社员能增加收入。
    各地农业社在制定分配方案的同时，对鳏寡孤独户作了适当照顾。中共河曲县刘家峪采取农业社包干和国家救济相结合的办法，使二十二户鳏寡孤独社员的生活比去年有了显著改善。
