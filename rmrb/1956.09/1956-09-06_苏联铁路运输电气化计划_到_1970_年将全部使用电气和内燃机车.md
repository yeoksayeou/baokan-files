    Soviet Railway Transportation Electrification Plan
    All Electric and Diesel Locomotives by 1970
    (Our Moscow dispatch, September 5) By 1970, all railway transportation in the Soviet Union will use electric and diesel locomotives, with electrified railways reaching a length of 40,000 kilometers, a figure almost equal to the total length of railway electrification in the world over the past fifty years. This was stated yesterday by Samakhvalov, Director of the Technical Administration of the Soviet Ministry of Transportation, at a press conference. Currently, electric and diesel locomotives used on Soviet railways account for 14% of the total railway transportation volume, with electric locomotives accounting for 8.5%. By 1960, the transportation volume of electric and diesel locomotives will reach 40% to 50%, and by 1965, it will reach 80% to 85%. By the time railway transportation is fully electrified in 1970, electric locomotive transportation will account for 60% and diesel locomotive transportation will account for 40%.
    Samakhvalov said: The transportation capacity of electric locomotives is twice that of steam locomotives, and diesel locomotives have 80% higher transportation capacity than steam locomotives. Transshipment capacity has increased from 25% to 70%, and the commercial speed of electric locomotives has also increased by 50%, while diesel locomotives have increased by 25%. For example, in the Balabinsk section of the Omsk Railway, the commercial speed in the fourth quarter of 1953 was 27.7 kilometers per hour, but after switching to electric traction, it increased to 44.6 kilometers per hour in the fourth quarter of 1955, a 64% increase.
    Samakhvalov also said: Switching to electric locomotives is also very beneficial for saving. For example, it is estimated that a total of 72 million tons of coal and 12 billion rubles can be saved during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. The labor efficiency of electric locomotives also greatly exceeds that of steam locomotives. In 1955, the average daily labor efficiency per kilometer of steam locomotives was 355,000 tons, while that of electric locomotives was 641,000 tons, 80% more than the former. For example, in the Balabinsk transport section, the labor efficiency of individual electric locomotives has reached 2 million tons per kilometer.

    苏联铁路运输电气化计划
    到1970年将全部使用电气和内燃机车
    本报莫斯科5日电　苏联铁路运输到1970年将全部使用电气机车和内燃机车，实行电气化的铁路长度达四万公里，这个数字几乎等于近五十年来全世界铁路电气化的总长度。这是苏联交通部技术管理局局长萨马赫瓦洛夫昨天在记者招待会上说的。目前苏联铁路上使用的电气机车和内燃机车占全部铁路运输量的14％，其中电气机车占8.5％。到1960年电气机车和内燃机车的运输量将要达到40％到50％，到1965年，将要达到80％到85％。到1970年铁路运输全部电气化时候，其中电气机车运输量占60％，内燃机车运输量占40％。
    萨马赫瓦洛夫说：电气机车的运输能力要比蒸气机车提高一倍，内燃机车比蒸气机车运输能力高80％。转运能力从25％提高到70％，电气机车商运速度也提高了50％，内燃机车提高了25％。例如鄂木斯克铁路的巴拉宾斯克运输段，在1953年第四季度商运速度是每小时二十七点七公里，但改为电气牵引后，在1955年第四季度每小时提高到四十四点六公里，快了64％。
    萨马赫瓦洛夫又说：改用电气机车后对于节约也大有好处。如在第六个五年计划预计一共可以节省七千二百万吨煤和一百二十亿卢布。电气机车劳动效率也大大超过蒸气机车，在1955年蒸气机车平均每昼夜每公里劳动效率是三十五万五千吨，而电气机车是六十四万一千吨，比前者多80％。如在巴拉宾斯克运输段，个别的电气机车劳动效率已经达到每公里二百万吨。
