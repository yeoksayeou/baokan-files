Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: The Japanese government held a cabinet meeting today and decided to agree to Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama's visit to the Soviet Union in order to break the deadlock in Soviet-Japanese negotiations.

At the cabinet meeting, Hatoyama stated his determination to personally visit the Soviet Union and be responsible for the Soviet-Japanese negotiations. Kyodo News said that Hatoyama also explained the new policy for reopening Soviet-Japanese negotiations at the meeting. This new policy, known as the "Hatoyama method" (also known as the "mixed method"), involves: temporarily shelving all territorial issues between the Soviet Union and Japan, declaring the end of the state of war between the two countries, and restoring diplomatic relations; establishing embassies in each other's countries; immediately repatriating detainees in the Soviet Union; confirming the entry into force of the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Treaty; and requesting the Soviet Union to unconditionally support Japan's entry into the United Nations. This new policy was proposed by Hatoyama at a meeting of ruling party leaders on the evening of the 5th and was approved by the ruling party leaders.

Today's cabinet meeting also decided to send Shunichi Matsumoto, who has been participating in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, to Moscow first to inquire about the Soviet side's views on Japan's new policy for restoring diplomatic relations and to prepare for the high-level talks to be held during Hatoyama's visit to the Soviet Union. Ruling party leaders in Japan also held a meeting today and decided to agree to the plan to send Matsumoto to the Soviet Union first.

At the same time, some elements of the anti-mainstream faction are still carrying out activities to obstruct the resumption of Soviet-Japanese negotiations. Shigemitsu Hosaka, the most stubborn member of the Yoshida faction of the anti-mainstream faction, also engaged in lobbying activities with Kenzō Matsumura of the Progressive Party system today, attempting to unite the former Liberal Party members and the former Progressive Party members to carry out the so-called "reconstruction" of the Liberal Democratic Party to weaken the influence of the mainstream faction. News reports say that Kenzō Matsumura did not agree with this proposal, saying that it would be prudent to adopt the approach of the opposition party within the ruling party to carry out this activity.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th: According to Kyodo News Agency in Washington, the United States is about to present Japan with the United States' "legal interpretation" of the territorial issues between the Soviet Union and Japan, preparing to formally demand that Japan not recognize the Kuril Islands and southern Sakhalin as Soviet territory, threatening Japan not to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union. According to authoritative sources, "The United States is fundamentally opposed to the Kuril Islands and southern Sakhalin being owned by the Soviet Union."

Kyodo News said that, in the final analysis, the legal interpretation that the United States wants to notify Japan is to express to Japan that Japan should not recognize the Kuril Islands and southern Sakhalin as Soviet property, that is, to oppose Japan's full acceptance of the Soviet plan. This will force Japan to repeat its previous claims when Soviet-Japanese negotiations resume; or, although withdrawing the request to "return" Kunashir Island and Etorofu Island, it will not recognize Soviet sovereignty over the Kuril Islands and southern Sakhalin, in order to demand concessions from the Soviet Union.

Kyodo News also said that if Japan accepts this legal interpretation from the United States and acts accordingly, the situation will become "awkward."

### 日本内阁决定鸠山去苏联谈判  共同社说美国仍将阻挠日苏谈判

    日本内阁决定鸠山去苏联谈判
    共同社说美国仍将阻挠日苏谈判
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本政府今天举行内阁会议，决定同意日本首相鸠山一郎访问苏联，以打开苏、日谈判的僵局。
    鸠山在内阁会议上表明了他要亲自访问苏联，负责进行苏、日谈判的决心。共同社说，鸠山在会上还说明了重开苏日谈判的新方针。这个被称为“鸠山方式”（又称“混合方式”）的新方针的内容是：在暂时搁置苏日两国一切领土问题的条件下，宣布结束苏日两国间的战争状态，恢复邦交；互设大使馆；立即遣返在苏联的被拘留人员；确认苏日渔业条约生效；要求苏联无条件地支持日本加入联合国。这个新方针是鸠山在5日晚间举行的执政党首脑会议上提出的，并且得到执政党首脑的同意。
    今天的内阁会议还决定派遣一直参加苏日谈判的松本俊一先到莫斯科，去探询苏联方面对日本这一恢复邦交的新方针的意见，为鸠山访苏时将举行的高级会谈作准备。日本执政党首脑们今天也举行了会议，决定同意派遣松本首先访苏的计划。
    在这同时，反主流派的一些分子仍在进行阻挠苏日谈判重新恢复的活动。反主流派中最顽固的吉田派分子保利茂今天还向前改进党系的松村谦三进行拉拢活动，企图使前自由党人和前改进党人联合起来，进行所谓“重建”自由民主党的活动来削弱主流派的影响。消息报道，松村谦三并没有赞成这个倡议，他表示在执政党内采取在野党的作法来进行这种活动是要慎重的。
    据新华社5日讯　据共同社华盛顿消息，美国即将向日本提出美国对苏日两国间领土问题的“法律解释”，准备正式要求日本不得承认千岛群岛和库页岛南部是苏联的领土，威胁日本不得同苏联达成协议。据权威人士说，“美国根本反对千岛群岛和库页岛南部为苏联所有”。
    共同社说，归根结蒂，美国要通知给日本的法律解释是向日本作一种表示：日本不应该承认千岛群岛和库页岛南部为苏联所有，也就是反对日本全面接受苏联的方案。这就使日本在日苏谈判恢复时，只能重复以往的主张；或者虽然撤销“归还”国后岛和择捉岛的要求，却不承认苏联对千岛群岛和库页岛南部的主权，来要求苏联作出让步。
    共同社还说，假如日本接受美国的这个法律解释，并按此行事，形势将会变得“窘迫”起来。
