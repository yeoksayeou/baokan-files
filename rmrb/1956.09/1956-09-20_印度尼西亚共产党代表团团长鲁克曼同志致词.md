Dear Comrades!

First of all, the Indonesian Communist Party delegation would like to express how honored we feel to be able to attend your Party's Eighth National Congress today. Having arrived in your country to attend this Congress only a few days ago, we have further realized that the inexhaustible source of strength and creativity that enabled the Chinese Communists to achieve great victories in the past and are now carrying out great socialist construction lies in their trust in the people and their trust in the Party. Based on this understanding, we are fully confident that your Party's ongoing Congress will successfully summarize the rich experiences of the past eleven years since the Seventh National Congress. These experiences will enrich the treasure trove of Marxism-Leninism and be used to build a great socialist China. At the same time, this understanding also strengthens our confidence that our Party and the Indonesian people will also achieve new victories in the struggle for complete national independence, democracy, and peace.

Comrades, in order to convey our Party's congratulations to your Party's Eighth National Congress, please allow me to read the congratulatory letter from our Party Central Committee, signed by Comrade D.N. Aidit. The content of the congratulatory letter is as follows:

To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and all participants of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

Dear Comrades!

The Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, on behalf of all members and sympathizers of the Indonesian Communist Party, extends warm fraternal congratulations to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

We have learned much from the resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in April 1945, and we are convinced that the achievements of the ongoing Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China will give us more enlightenment. We joyfully and heartily congratulate you on your many achievements in implementing the resolutions of the Seventh National Congress, in striving for the final victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and in establishing a democratic coalition government, in short, in thoroughly completing the New Democratic Revolution. The communists and progressives of Indonesia pay the highest tribute to all the sons and daughters of China who sacrificed themselves in this extremely fierce struggle.

The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China is being held not only under the circumstances that all the resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China have been completely fulfilled, but also after having taken a big step forward. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have now established their own socialist country, where large-scale industrialization has begun, agricultural cooperativization has been realized, and purely private enterprises have been transformed into joint state-private enterprises. Compared with the time when the Seventh National Congress was held, the number of members of your party has greatly increased. While achieving all these progresses, the living standards of the people have been improved, and the national culture, progressive culture and scientific culture of the Chinese people have been developed.

On the international political stage, in addition to the Soviet Union, the forefront and strongest fortress of the socialist camp and the progressive camp, China, together with other countries of the socialist camp, has played a decisive role in determining the destiny of the current world. The establishment of the new China on the ruins of the old China, and the emergence of the people's China on the barren hills of the China ruled by landlords, bureaucratic capitalists, and comprador bourgeoisie, has greatly changed the face of Asia and changed the face of the modern world. This fact greatly helps all the people of colonial, semi-colonial or newly independent countries to achieve their goal of complete national independence. This fact gives them great encouragement. This fact makes the impossible possible and makes the very difficult less difficult.

The changes in the world situation and the Asian situation caused by the victories of the Chinese people and the people of other countries are very beneficial to the Indonesian people, who are currently striving for complete national independence, democracy, and peace, especially for the liberation of West Irian, the legal territory of the Republic of Indonesia still occupied by Dutch colonialism, for economic independence, and against the evil activities of the imperialist warmongers. Uniting all progressive and democratic forces in the country and isolating the anti-people die-hards is an indispensable condition for the cause of achieving complete national independence. On this issue, Indonesian progressives have received great help from the rich experience of the Chinese people.

Due to the tremendous achievements of the Chinese people in building their socialist country, the peace that the nations of Asia urgently need will be more guaranteed. Honest people in Asia and all progressives in the world regard the achievements of the Chinese people as their own achievements, because these achievements strengthen the struggle for peace and democracy, for national liberation, and for socialism.

The Communist Party of China has been tempered in leading the long and arduous struggles of the past and in recently building socialist China. We are confident that your Congress will achieve the greatest success.

Long live socialist China, a friend of the peoples of Asia and other peace-loving nations in the world!

Long live the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which will inspire the Chinese people and expand their achievements!

Long live the standard-bearer who holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and the banner of liberation, the liberator of mankind, and the communists all over the world!

Long live the traditional and lasting friendship between the Indonesian people and the Chinese people!

Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party
General Secretary
D.N. Aidit

Comrades! I have finished my speech, thank you.

    印度尼西亚共产党代表团团长鲁克曼同志致词亲爱的同志们！
    首先我们印度尼西亚共产党代表团愿意借此表示，我们今天能够参加你们党的第八次代表大会，我们的心里感到多么的荣幸。我们来到你们的国家参加这次大会，才只有几天的时间，我们就已经进一步地体会到，中国共产党人过去能够取得伟大的胜利，目前又在进行伟大的社会主义建设，他们的力量和创造力永不枯竭的泉源，就在于他们信任人民群众，信任党。基于这种认识，我们完全相信，你们党正在举行的代表大会一定能够成功地总结第七次代表大会后十一年来的丰富经验，这些经验将丰富马克思列宁主义的宝库并用以建设伟大的社会主义中国。同时，这种认识也加强了我们的信心，我们的党和印度尼西亚人民在争取完全的民族独立、民主和和平的斗争中也将会取得新的胜利。
    同志们，为了转达我们党对你们党的第八次代表大会的祝贺，请允许我读一下由迪·劳·艾地同志签署的我们党中央委员会的贺信，贺信的内容如下：致中国共产党中央委员会和中国共产党第八次代表大会的全体与会者。亲爱的同志们！
    印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会代表印度尼西亚共产党的全体党员和同情者向中国共产党第八次全国代表大会表示热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    我们从一九四五年四月举行的中国共产党第七次代表大会的决议中学习了许多东西，我们深信，正在举行的中国共产党第八次代表大会的成果将会给我们更多的教益。你们在执行第七次代表大会的决议中、在争取抗日战争的最后胜利中和在建立民主的联合政府中，简单地说，在彻底完成新民主主义革命中，取得了很多成就，我们愉快地和衷心地表示祝贺。印度尼西亚的共产党人和进步人士向所有在这一极其激烈的斗争中牺牲了的中华儿女致以最崇高的敬意。
    中国共产党第八次代表大会不仅是在中国共产党第七次代表大会的全部决议已经完满实现的情况下举行的，而且是在已经前进了一大步的情况下举行的。在中国共产党的领导下，中国人民现在已经建立了自己的社会主义国家，在这里，大规模的工业化已经开始，农业合作化已经实现，纯私营的企业已经变成公私合营的企业。同第七次代表大会举行的时候比较起来，你们党的党员人数已经大大地增加了。在获得这一切进步的同时，人民的生活水平提高了，中国人民的民族文化，进步的和科学的文化发展起来了。
    在国际政治舞台上，除了社会主义阵营和进步阵营的最前线和最坚固的堡垒——苏联之外，中国和社会主义阵营的其他国家一道，在决定目前世界的命运中已经起了决定性的作用。新中国在旧中国的废墟上建立起来，人民的中国在地主、官僚资本家和买办资产阶级所统治的中国的荒丘上出现，这就大大地改变了亚洲的面貌，改变了现代世界的面貌。这一事实大大地帮助殖民地、半殖民地或刚独立的国家的全体人民去实现他们的完全的民族独立的目标。这一事实给予他们很大的鼓舞。这一事实使原来不可能的东西变为可能，使原来非常困难的东西变为不大困难。
    由于中国人民和其他国家人民的胜利而引起的世界局势和亚洲局势的变化是很有利于印度尼西亚人民的，他们目前正在全力争取完全的民族独立、民主和和平，特别是解放目前仍为荷兰殖民主义所占领的印度尼西亚共和国的合法领土——西伊里安，争取经济上的独立和反对帝国主义战争煽动者的罪恶活动。团结全国一切进步的和民主的力量并孤立反人民的顽固势力，这是实现完全的民族独立的事业中所绝不可少的条件，在这一个问题上，印度尼西亚的进步分子从中国人民的丰富经验中得到了很大的帮助。
    由于中国人民在建设自己的社会主义国家中所取得的巨大成就，亚洲各民族所迫切需要的和平就将会愈有保障。亚洲的正直的人们和世界上所有的进步分子把中国人民所取得的成就看作自己的成就，因为这些成就加强了争取和平民主、争取民族解放和争取社会主义的斗争。
    中国共产党在领导过去的长期艰苦的斗争中和在最近建立社会主义中国中受到了锻炼，我们深信，你们的代表大会一定会取得最大的成就。
    亚洲各民族和世界上其他热爱和平的民族的朋友，社会主义中国万岁！
    将鼓舞中国人民和扩大他们的成就的中国共产党第八次代表大会万岁！
    高举马克思列宁主义旗帜和解放旗帜的旗手，人类的解放者，全世界的共产主义者万岁！
    印度尼西亚人民和中国人民传统的持久的友谊万岁！
            印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会
                        总书记
                      迪·劳·艾地
    同志们！我的话讲完了，谢谢。
