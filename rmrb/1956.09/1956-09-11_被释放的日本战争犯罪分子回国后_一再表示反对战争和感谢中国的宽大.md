Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th. Japanese war criminals who were released by China have repeatedly expressed their opposition to war and their gratitude for China's lenient policy after returning home.

    The fact that Japanese war criminals expressed remorse and repentance in China aroused suspicion among some reporters from Japanese bourgeois newspapers. They believed that the Japanese war criminals would make anti-China remarks as soon as they left China. However, after returning home, the Japanese war criminals continued to express sincere repentance, just as they had done in China. As a result, some bourgeois newspapers added headlines such as "Strange Confession of Returning War Criminals" and "Forced General Confession" when reporting their conversations. Later, the war criminals continued to explain their true feelings, which silenced these newspapers.
    After returning home, Japanese war criminals were invited to introduce the situation in China at village meetings, street meetings, and various other mass gatherings. At a gathering of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, a company manager, after hearing about the situation in China, said: "Initially, I heard that war criminals were treated leniently in China, and I couldn't believe it at all." "But after listening further, I realized that China's policy is not just for show. If there is no real sincerity, it is impossible to keep up the pretense for six years. At the same time, I also understand that the suffering inflicted on the Chinese people during the war was enormous. It was only natural for China to detain war criminals. The early release of war criminals back to their country demonstrates China's leniency even more. I think Japan's current rearmament is completely wrong."
    A man named Aoki from Sunagawa-cho in Tokyo said: "The war criminals' remarks deeply resonated with us, and we are determined not to cause any more wars. We do not want to be war criminals, and we certainly do not want to be tragic victims of war." The residents of Sunagawa-cho have been opposing the expansion of the U.S. military's air base in the area. Aoki said, "Recently, we have come to understand the principle that Japan's farmland should not be used as a base for atomic and hydrogen bomb warfare."
    When Kawanishi Kinji, a war criminal from Tokyo, returned home, he learned that his three brothers had already died in the war. His mother said with tears in her eyes: "No matter what happens, I will never let you go again." His mother was grateful for China's humanitarian treatment of her son, which saved him from dying of illness. After listening to Kawanishi's introduction to the situation in China, relatives and neighbors said: "What you said is absolutely correct." They expressed their belief that China must be making rapid progress in building a socialist society.

### 被释放的日本战争犯罪分子回国后  一再表示反对战争和感谢中国的宽大

    被释放的日本战争犯罪分子回国后
    一再表示反对战争和感谢中国的宽大
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：被中国释放的日本战争犯罪分子们回国后一再表示反对战争，感谢中国的宽大政策。
    日本战争犯罪分子们在中国表示认罪悔过的情形，曾经引起日本某些资产阶级报社的记者的怀疑，他们认为日本战争犯罪分子们一离开中国就会发表反对中国的谈话。但是，日本战争犯罪分子回国后像在中国一样，继续表示真诚悔过。因此，一些资产阶级报纸在报道他们的谈话的时候就加上“归国战犯的奇怪认罪”、“被强迫的总忏悔”等标题。后来，战争犯罪分子们不断说明自己的真实心情，使得这些报纸沉默下来了。
    日本战争犯罪分子回国后被邀请在村会、街会和其他各种群众集会上介绍了中国的情况。在一个中小企业家的集会上，一位公司的经理听过中国的情况后说：“最初，听说战犯在中国受过宽待，无论如何我是不相信的。”“但是，继续听了下去，才知道中国的政策并不是装饰门面的。如果（中国）没有真实的诚意，六年的时间是不能始终不变地装饰下去的。同时，我还了解了，我们在战争中使中国人民遭受的悲惨祸害是非常大的。中国拘留了战犯是当然的事。至于提前释放战犯回国更显得中国的宽大。我认为日本现在的重整军备是完全错误的。”
    东京砂川町一位叫青木的说：“战犯们的言论深深地引起了我们的同感，我们决不愿再引起任何战争了。我们不希望作战争罪人，同时也更不希望作一个悲惨的战争受害者。”砂川町的居民一直在反对美军扩大当地的空军基地，青木说，“最近我们已经知道日本的农田不能被当作原子弹和氢弹战争基地的道理。”
    家在东京的一个战争犯罪分子川西锦二回家时，知道他的三个弟兄都已经在战争中死亡了。他的母亲流着眼泪说：“无论有什么事情发生，我再也不放开你了”。他的母亲感激中国对她的儿子的人道主义待遇，把他从病死的状况中救活。亲戚邻居们听过川西介绍中国情况后说：你的话绝对不会错。他们表示相信，中国一定是日新月异突飞猛进地在建设社会主义社会。
