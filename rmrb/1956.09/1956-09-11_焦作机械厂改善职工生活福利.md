Jiaozuo Machinery Factory Improves Workers' Living Welfare

(Our report) The leadership of the local state-owned Jiaozuo Machinery Factory has recently earnestly improved the living welfare measures for its workers.

The factory first adjusted housing prices and improved workers' living conditions. In the past, workers had to pay 8 jiao, 2 fen, and 5 li of rent per room per month. Now, after research by the factory's Party, government, labor union, and Youth League leaders, it has been decided to classify the dormitories into three grades, with an average rent of only 5 jiao and 3 li per room per month for each person. Rent for family housing has also been reduced by 1 jiao per room per month. All worker housing has also been fitted with screens and bamboo curtains, and is sprayed with DDT at least once a month.

There have also been improvements in the worker canteen. In the past, workers could only eat at the canteen during the day, but now they can buy food late at night. The variety of food has increased, and the prices are lower than before. At the same time, the factory has built a new canteen for Hui people, so that Hui workers no longer need to travel several miles home or to the streets to eat.

In July, the factory also built a temporary female workshop and a lactation room.

Workers working in high-temperature workshops can eat two eggs every day in the summer, with fifty or sixty people benefitting, and can drink white sugar rice soup after get off work in the evening. Workers have also received supplies such as gloves, masks, and tea mugs.

Under the leadership of the factory's Party branch, a visiting group organized by the labor union, the Youth League, and the administration has recently visited workers' dormitories in succession, promptly providing subsidies to workers with living difficulties and repairing houses that are in danger of collapsing.

The workers are very satisfied with these measures, and their enthusiasm for production has generally increased. The factory's production plan for July was completed relatively well. The total output value fulfilled 112.19% of the plan, the labor productivity fulfilled 100.09% of the plan, the profit plan fulfilled 172.5% of the plan, and the cost of each waterwheel was reduced by more than 14 yuan.

    焦作机械厂改善职工生活福利
    本报讯　地方国营焦作机械厂领导人员最近认真改善了职工的生活福利措施。
    这个厂首先调整了房价，改善了职工的居住条件。过去，职工每人每月每间房要出房租八角二分五厘。现在，经厂内党政工团领导人员研究，决定将宿舍评为三等，平均每人每月每间房只出房租五角零三厘。家属住房房租，每间每月也降低一角。职工住房还都安上了纱窗，挂上竹帘，同时每月至少打一次滴滴涕。
    职工食堂也有了改进。过去，职工只能在白天到食堂吃饭，现在深夜也可以买到饭吃。饭菜的花样增加了，价钱也比以前降低。同时，厂里新建了一所回民食堂，回民职工已经不需要跑到几里路以外的家里，或到街上吃饭了。
    7月份，厂里还新建了临时女工房和哺乳室。
    在高温车间工作的工人，夏天每天有五、六十个人可以吃到两个鸡蛋，晚上下班以后可以喝白糖大米汤。工人们还领到了手套、口罩、茶缸等用品。
    在工厂党总支的领导下，由工会、青年团、行政派人组织访问团，在最近连续到职工宿舍进行了访问，及时对生活有困难的职工进行了补助，对有倒塌危险的房屋加以修补。
    职工们对这些措施都很满意，生产积极性普遍提高。7月份这个厂生产计划完成得比较好。总产值完成计划112.19％，劳动生产率计划完成100.09％，利润计划完成172.5％，每部水车的成本降低了十四元多。（司效禹）
