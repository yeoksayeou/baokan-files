Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 6th – Shandong Province will realize the socialist nature of agricultural cooperation this autumn and winter. Currently, 93% of peasant households in the province have joined agricultural cooperatives, with 66.5% of the total peasant households participating in advanced cooperatives.

At the recent Shandong Provincial Autumn Grain Distribution and Autumn Tax/Purchase Work Conference, in addition to discussing autumn distribution and autumn tax/purchase, the issue of realizing full socialist agricultural cooperation was also studied. The conference decided that in this autumn and winter's agricultural cooperation movement, on the basis of actively consolidating and improving existing agricultural production cooperatives, we should continue to absorb non-member farmers into cooperatives according to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, upgrade existing elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, and increase the number of peasant households joining advanced cooperatives to about 90% of the province's total peasant households. In areas where advancement has already been completed, the main task is to carry out consolidation work, concentrate all efforts on production and distribution, strengthen political work, and at the same time, in conjunction with cooperative rectification, continue to absorb non-member farmers into cooperatives and upgrade existing individual elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives. In areas where the proportion of peasant households joining advanced cooperatives has reached about 70%, in addition to rectifying and consolidating existing cooperatives, leadership should be strengthened, work should be done well to upgrade cooperatives and absorb new members, and the task of advancement should be completed. In areas with a relatively small proportion of advanced cooperatives, while firmly grasping the rectification of existing cooperatives, efforts should be concentrated on doing a good job in upgrading elementary cooperatives and absorbing farmers outside the cooperatives to complete the task of advancement.

When discussing the scale of advanced cooperatives, the conference believed that the current general scale of advanced cooperatives is suited to the productive relationship and productivity. It should be stabilized at this scale for a period of time in order to fully exploit the superiority of this new productive relationship and concentrate all efforts on improving agricultural production. If mergers occur every year, putting the cooperatives in a state of constant change, this would be extremely detrimental to consolidating the cooperatives and developing agricultural production. Therefore, the conference requested that most advanced cooperatives remain stable this autumn and winter, in order to concentrate efforts on completing the task of advancement and use sufficient time to fully develop production and rectify consolidation work. When it is necessary to merge small cooperatives and expand the scale due to upgrading and the absorption of new members, the needs of production, the voluntariness of members, natural conditions, the original foundation, and the status of leading cadres must be taken into account, and blind pursuit of size should be avoided.

The conference especially reminded all localities that in the work of upgrading, merging, and absorbing new members, the principle of voluntariness must be conscientiously implemented, patient and in-depth mass work and thorough and detailed ideological preparation must be carried out, and the demand for 100% cooperation must never be forced. Whether elementary cooperatives should be upgraded, whether they should be merged, and the size of the scale should all be decided by the leadership in mobilizing the masses of members, based on actual needs, and through democratic discussion. Regarding the issue of individual farmers joining cooperatives, it is absolutely impermissible to think that they are irrelevant because they have become a minority, and not to carry out patient work, but to use simple methods to force them into cooperatives, nor can they be ignored outside the cooperatives. If a majority of members of individual elementary cooperatives are willing to wait another year, they should be allowed to do so. The wishes of farmers who are currently unwilling to join the cooperatives must be respected, and they must never be discriminated against or attacked because of this. On the contrary, they should be united and educated with full enthusiasm.

The conference also studied various specific policies in the process of advancement, and required all localities to combine autumn distribution and the current cooperative rectification, to make specific plans for the autumn and winter cooperation movement, to explain the guidelines, tasks, policies, practices, and work steps to the cadres, to select and train leading backbone personnel of the cooperatives, and to carry out preparatory work such as publicizing and studying the model articles of association of advanced cooperatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 6th – The advanced agricultural cooperation movement in Hunan Province has entered a high tide. Currently, there are more than 33,000 advanced agricultural cooperatives that have been newly established or are being established throughout the province, of which more than 17,000 have already been established and are currently organizing labor to arrange autumn and winter production, and more than 16,000 are dealing with specific issues in upgrading and merging. In addition, the establishment work of more than 11,900 advanced cooperatives is also about to be fully launched. By the end of September, all of the province's original more than 87,000 elementary cooperatives, with the exception of a few areas severely affected by drought, will be merged and transformed into advanced agricultural cooperatives.

Last winter, while establishing a large number of elementary agricultural cooperatives, Hunan Province also piloted more than 4,400 advanced cooperatives. At that time, peasant households participating in advanced cooperatives accounted for only 14% of the province's total peasant households. Those participating in elementary cooperatives already accounted for 66% of the total peasant households. This work of establishing new advanced cooperatives is mainly carried out on the basis of merging and upgrading existing elementary cooperatives. This work started in mid-July and was carried out in batches. Prior to this, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the local party committees had held a series of meetings to study many specific issues in the merger of elementary agricultural cooperatives into advanced cooperatives, and formulated plans for advanced agricultural cooperation, and also trained a large number of cadres. By the end of August, the number of farmer backbone personnel trained by the counties for running advanced cooperatives reached more than 100,000.

When merging elementary agricultural cooperatives into advanced cooperatives, the counties also widely organized rural propaganda teams to publicize the various policies for transitioning to advanced cooperatives and the superiority of advanced cooperatives. Many places also combined distribution to summarize the superiority of the original advanced agricultural cooperatives in the local area. The fact that these advanced cooperatives were able to increase production more than elementary cooperatives encouraged the enthusiasm of the members of the elementary cooperatives to demand a transition to advanced cooperatives.

### 领导初级社稳步升为高级社  山东安排农业社升级并社工作，湖南作出新建高级社规划

    领导初级社稳步升为高级社
    山东安排农业社升级并社工作，湖南作出新建高级社规划
    新华社济南6日电　山东省将在今年秋冬实现社会主义性质的农业合作化。现在全省已有93％的农户加入了农业合作社，其中加入高级社的农户占总农户的66.5％。
    在最近召开的山东省秋季粮食决分与秋征秋购工作会议上，除了讨论秋季分配及秋征秋购外，还就实现全社会主义农业合作化的问题进行了研究。会议决定：在今年秋冬的农业合作化运动中，应该在积极巩固提高现有农业生产合作社的基础上，继续按照自愿互利原则，吸收未入社的农民参加合作社，把现有初级社上升为高级社，把加入高级社的农户增加到占全省总农户的90％左右。在已经完成高级化的地方，主要任务是进行整顿巩固工作，集中全力搞好生产和分配，加强政治工作，同时结合整社继续吸收未入社的农民入社和把现有的个别初级社升为高级社。在加入高级社农户已占70％左右的地区，除了整顿巩固现有社外，应当加强领导，做好升社和吸收新社员的工作，最后完成高级化。在高级化比重较小的地区，在抓紧整顿现有社的同时，集中力量做好初级社的升级工作和吸收社外农民入社，完成高级化的任务。
    在讨论高级社的规模时，会议认为目前一般规模的高级社，生产关系和生产力是相适应的，应当在这样的规模上稳定一个时期，以充分发挥这种新的生产关系的优越性，集中一切力量提高农业生产，如果每年合并，使合作社长期处于变动不定的状态，这对于巩固社和发展农业生产都是极为不利的。因此，会议要求今年秋冬大多数高级社可以稳定不动，以便集中精力完成高级化的任务，并用充分的时间全力发展生产和整顿巩固工作。凡由于升级和吸收新社员而需要合并小社和扩大规模时，也必须考虑到生产需要、社员自愿、自然条件、原有基础、领导骨干等方面的状况，不要盲目贪大。
    会议特别提醒各地在升级合并和吸收新社员的工作中，必须切实贯彻执行自愿原则，进行耐心深入的群众工作，和充分细致的思想酝酿，绝不能勉强要求百分之百的合作化。初级社是否升级，是否合并，以及规模的大小，都要有领导地发动社员群众，根据实际需要，民主讨论决定。对于个体农民入社问题，决不可以因为他们已成少数，就认为无关大局，不去进行耐心的工作，而用简单的方法强制他们入社，也不可放在社外置之不理。如果个别初级社的多数社员愿意再看一年，就应当允许他们再看一年。对目前还不愿意入社的农民，必须尊重他们的意愿，决不可因此歧视和打击他们，相反的应该以满腔热情来更好地团结和教育他们。
    会议还研究了高级化过程中的各项具体政策，并且要求各地结合秋季分配及通过当前的整社，做好制定秋冬合作化运动的具体规划，向干部交代方针、任务、政策、做法和工作步骤，挑选和培养训练社的领导骨干，宣传和学习高级社示范章程等项准备工作。
    新华社长沙6日电　湖南省高级农业合作化运动已经进入高潮。目前，全省新建成的和正在建立的高级农业社已有三万三千多个，其中已经建成的一万七千多个社，当前正在组织劳力安排秋、冬季生产，有一万六千多个社正在处理升级、并社中的具体问题。此外，还有一万一千九百多个高级社的建社工作也即将全面铺开。到9月底，全省原有的八万七千多个初级社除个别旱灾严重地区外，其余的都将分别合并转为高级农业社。
    去年冬季湖南省在大批建立初级农业社的同时，试办了四千四百多个高级社。当时参加高级社的农户只占全省农户总数的14％。参加初级社的已占农户总数的66％。这次新建高级社的工作，主要是在原有初级社的基础上进行合并和升级。这项工作是从7月中旬开始、分批进行的。在这以前，中共湖南省委和各地方党委曾召开了一系列会议，研究了初级农业社合并转为高级社中的许多具体问题，并作出了农业高级合作化的规划，还训练了大批干部。到8月底各县先后训练的办高级社的农民骨干就达十多万人。
    各县在把初级农业社合并转为高级社的时候，还广泛组织了农村的宣传队伍，对转为高级社的各项政策和高级社的优越性进行了宣传，许多地方还结合分配，总结了当地原有高级农业社的优越性。这些高级社能比初级社更加增产的事实，鼓舞了初级社社员要求转为高级社的积极性。
