Xinhua News Agency, September 9th, Cairo Dispatch: The Egyptian Presidential Palace spokesman announced on the evening of the 8th that President Abdel Nasser would hold talks with the "Five-Nation Committee" at 22:30 Universal Time on the 9th.

This will be the first meeting between the two sides since September 5th. No meetings were held in the previous three days.

According to "Al-Ahram," serious disagreements have arisen among the members of the "Five-Nation Committee." The committee's meeting on September 7th lasted three and a half hours, and the atmosphere at the meeting was very tense.

The Indian Press Trust reported that some members of the "Five-Nation Committee" are still unwilling to leave Cairo and want to make further efforts to see if they can build "some kind of bridge" across the gulf between the two sides.

Egyptian President Nasser and his aides have also held a series of meetings to study the situation. He has maintained contact with the Indian Ambassador, Ali Yavar Jung.

A commentator on Cairo Radio said on the evening of the 8th that the failure of the "Five-Nation Committee" headed by Menzies is unavoidable. It was clear from the beginning that Egypt would never give up its complete sovereign integrity over all its territory.

    纳赛尔再同“五国委员会”会谈
    开罗电台说孟席斯等人不能避免失败
    据新华社9日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统府发言人8日晚间宣布，阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔总统将在9日国际标准时间二十二时三十分同“五国委员会”举行会谈。
    这将是9月5日以来双方第一次会谈，前三天，会谈都没有举行。
    据“金字塔报”说，在“五国委员会”委员之间产生了严重的分歧。委员会9月7日的会议开了三个半小时，会议上的气氛十分紧张。
    印度报业托辣斯报道说，“五国委员会”中有些委员仍旧不愿意离开开罗，而想再进一步努力，看看是否能在双方之间的鸿沟上架起“某种桥梁”。
    埃及总统纳赛尔同他的助手也接连举行会议，研究局势。他同印度大使阿里·雅瓦尔·忠格保持着接触。
    开罗电台的评论员在8日晚间说，以孟席斯为首的“五国委员会”的失败是不能避免的。一开始就很明显，埃及决不会放弃它对自己的全部领土的完整主权。
