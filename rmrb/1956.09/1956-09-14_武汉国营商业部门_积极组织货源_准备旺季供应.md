Wuhan State-Owned Commercial Departments
Actively Organize Supply of Goods to Prepare for Peak Season

(Our report) Wuhan City's various state-owned companies have devised many methods to organize goods for the peak season. The Wuhan City Department Store, starting in July, successively sent cadres to many small and medium-sized cities to purchase goods. In these cities, some high-grade goods are generally still in stock, and these goods are needed by large cities. For example, high-top rubber shoes, duck down quilts, and plastic soap boxes are all out of stock in Wuhan. This time, the Wuhan City Department Store procured these goods from the commercial departments of some small and medium-sized cities using the principle of "mutual willingness and negotiated transactions."

The Timber Company also purchased a large quantity of willow logs, pine logs, pine boards, maple wood, and other miscellaneous woods from the Jingzhou, Huanggang, Xiaogan, and Yichang special districts of this province, as well as Jiangxi and Hunan provinces, to supply market needs.

Some companies have also broken with convention and adopted methods such as purchasing surplus social materials and bartering to expand their sources of goods. For example, the Hardware Company actively contacted more than 200 enterprises through salespersons and special purchasing agents to purchase accumulated stocks of various steels. In addition, it exchanged various steels with enterprises through mutual exchange.

In local processing orders, the companies paid attention to expanding new varieties of colors and designs. The City Department Store collected more than 170 new styles of leather shoe samples from Shanghai, and more than 80 styles have now been trial-produced locally, which are very popular with customers.

    武汉国营商业部门
    积极组织货源  准备旺季供应
    本报讯武汉市各个国营公司想出许多办法为旺季组织货源。武汉市百货公司自7月份开始，陆续派出干部分赴许多中小城市采购货物。在中小城市中，一般都还积存有些高级商品，而这些商品又为大城市所需要。例如高统胶鞋、鸭绒被、塑胶香皂盒等，都是武汉市脱销的商品，这次武汉市百货公司同一些中小城市的商业部门以“两情两愿，协商成交”的办法采购回来。
    木材公司也在本省荆州、黄冈、孝感、宜昌各专区以及江西、湖南等地买到大批柳元木、松元木、松板、枫木和其他杂木以供应市场需要。
    有些公司还打破陈规，采用收购社会剩余物资和以物易物互相调剂的办法来扩大货源。例如五金公司通过推销员和突击采购员主动和二百多个企业单位联系，收购积存的各种钢材，另外又和各企业单位用互相交换的办法，换回各种钢材。
    在对本地加工订货中，各公司注意了扩大新的花色品种。市百货公司在上海搜集回来新式皮鞋样品一百七十余种，现时已在本地试制了八十余种，很受顾客欢迎。
