Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 14th: Belgrade dispatch: At a banquet on the 13th in honor of Indonesian President Sukarno, Yugoslav President Tito said that recent developments have proven that to guarantee peace and universal social progress, it is necessary to adopt and adhere to a policy of active peaceful coexistence between countries. Only by adhering to these principles and adopting consultation as the only permissible method for resolving international problems can the danger of deteriorating relations and conflicts between countries be eliminated, and world peace be guaranteed for a longer period.

Tito said that today the greatest threat to peace and the easing of world tensions is the possibility of local conflicts, which could lead to all sorts of unimaginable consequences.

Tito told the Indonesian guests that Yugoslavia pays special attention to the evolving situation in Asia and Africa, and that Indonesia plays a very important role in this region. The recent situation in this region shows that it is possible to consolidate peace and guarantee progress in this part of the world.

Tito proposed a toast to President Sukarno. He believes that President Sukarno's visit has strengthened the friendly ties between Yugoslavia and Indonesia.

President Sukarno, in his toast in return to President Tito, also expressed the hope that his visit to Yugoslavia would further strengthen the already solid relations between the two countries.

Sukarno emphasized that colonialism is not dead, it still exists in Asia and Africa. Indonesia is still continuing to fight for the West Irian, which is currently under colonial rule.

About one hundred people, including President Sukarno's entourage and Yugoslav leaders, attended the banquet.

Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: Belgrade dispatch: Yugoslav President Tito and his wife held a reception on the evening of the 13th in honor of Indonesian President Sukarno.

Serbian folk dances were performed at the reception.

After the reception, Sukarno and his entourage left for Sarajevo to visit.
