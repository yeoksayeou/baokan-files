Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 22nd: The responsible persons of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Shanghai Municipal Organizations of various democratic parties, the responsible persons of the Shanghai Municipal People's Organizations, and non-party democratic人士, gathered this afternoon to discuss the Suez Canal issue.

Those who participated in the forum expressed their firm support for Premier Zhou Enlai's report at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Furthermore, they believed that Premier Zhou's solemn declaration in the report: "The Chinese people cannot remain indifferent to any action that infringes upon Egyptian sovereignty or carries out armed intervention against Egypt," represents the will of the people of the whole country.

Shen Zhiyuan, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC and Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, said at the meeting: We are closely watching the tense situation in the Suez Canal. We will use our mouths and pens, and use newspapers and publications to publicize the just struggle of the Egyptian people, expose the conspiracies of imperialism, and if imperialism dares to carry out armed intervention against Egypt, we will definitely support the Egyptian people with all our strength.

Zhou Bingkun, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, said: We Shanghai workers have a deep understanding of imperialist aggression. When Egypt needs pilots, many of our Shanghai seamen have signed up to volunteer their support. When Egypt needs machines, we will step up production and produce the machines supplied to Egypt ahead of schedule. We Shanghai workers are prepared to use all our strength to support our Egyptian brothers.

Li Zhaohuan, Hu Juewen, Wu Yiwu, Lu Yudao, Wu Ruo'an and other people from all walks of life who spoke at the meeting, all proposed to mobilize members of various parties and groups and the masses they are connected with to support the Egyptian people in various ways.

    上海各界座谈苏伊士运河问题
    一致表示全力支持埃及人民的斗争
    新华社上海22日电　政协上海市委员会和各民主党派上海市组织负责人、上海市各人民团体负责人、无党派民主人士，今天下午集会讨论苏伊士运河问题。
    参加座谈的人都表示坚决拥护周恩来总理在全国人民代表大会常务委员会会议上所作的报告。并且认为周总理在报告中严正声明：“任何侵犯埃及主权和对于埃及实行武装干涉的行动，中国人民都不能置若罔闻。”是代表了全国人民的意志。
    政协上海市委会副主席、中国民主同盟上海市委主任委员沈志远在会上说：我们正密切注视着苏伊士运河的紧张局势，我们要用口和笔，用报纸刊物宣传埃及人民的正义斗争，揭发帝国主义的阴谋，如果帝国主义胆敢对埃及实行武装干涉，我们一定用全力支援埃及人民。
    上海市工会联合会副主席周炳坤说：我们上海工人对帝国主义的侵略有着深切的体会。当埃及需要引水员的时候，我们上海就有许多海员工人报名志愿支援。当埃及需要机器的时候，我们就加紧生产，提早生产出供应埃及的机器。我们上海工人准备用一切力量支援埃及兄弟。
    在会上发言的黎照寰、胡厥文、吴艺五、卢于道、吴若安等各界人士，都提出要动员各党派各团体的成员和所联系的群众，用各种方式支援埃及人民。
