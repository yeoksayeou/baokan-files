Xinhua News Agency, Yingtan-Xiamen Railway Construction Site, September 3rd (Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Kuihua): Yesterday morning, the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway track-laying project had laid 462 kilometers of track, passing through the Daiyun Mountain peak, the watershed between southern and northern Fujian. The track-laying train is now heading downhill towards the final complex engineering section of the Daiyun Mountain key construction area. In this area, spanning over ten kilometers, there is not a single foot of relatively flat land that can be utilized. The railway line passes through steep mountains and deep valleys. Railway soldiers and Fujianese laborers are chiseling out the roadbed, one pickaxe and hammer at a time, on the mountainsides and cliffs, some 100 meters above the valley floor. After the train passes through this section, apart from crossing the Xiamen Strait, the majority of the route will be in the relatively flat hilly area of southern Fujian and the Jiulong River Plain.

The track-laying project of the Yingtan-Xiamen line began to advance towards the watershed on August 27th. In the past six days, the railway soldiers track-laying army has been advancing at an average speed of more than two kilometers per day, on slopes with a rise of 19 to 22 meters per kilometer. On the morning of September 1st, the track-laying train left the last small station on the north side of the watershed and headed towards the watershed. "The highest point of the watershed is ahead, keep going, comrades!" the soldiers encouraged each other. When the rail-pulling team advanced to the last high slope, they pulled a car loaded with twelve rails forward in four to five minutes, and the railway quickly extended towards the peak. Cinematographers ran up, capturing one exciting scene after another. At 6:00 PM, amid the enthusiastic cheers of the heroes who personally split the watershed, the train passed through a welcome archway with the inscription "Heroes Split the Watershed, Trains Pierce Through Thousands of Mountains" and slowly entered the 700-meter-long and 20-meter-deep watershed train passage. The train sounded its whistle, advancing towards southern Fujian. The train's smoke floated over the Daiyun Mountain peaks for the first time.

The Daiyun Mountain, the watershed between southern and northern Fujian, straddles the boundary of Yongan, Datian and other counties in central Fujian Province. Several tributaries of the Min River and Jiulong River originate here, and thousands of streams flow north and south. The highlands north and south are covered with primeval forest. For a long time, few people have set foot here. Liu Zhenggeng, a Red Army veteran with the rank of colonel in the Railway Corps who led the railway soldiers to this area, told reporters that this was his second time crossing this mountainous area. When he came to survey the route at the end of last year, there wasn't even a rugged mountain path here. In the high mountains and dense forests, they could only advance 600 meters a day. Sometimes, people walked in front, and beasts followed behind. They drove away the beasts and continued to move forward. The soldiers said: Thinking of the 25,000-mile Long March, building roads today is nothing to complain about.

### “英雄劈开分水岭，火车穿过万重山”  鹰厦铁路通过戴云山峰岭

    “英雄劈开分水岭，火车穿过万重山”
    鹰厦铁路通过戴云山峰岭
    新华社鹰厦铁路工地3日电新华社记者刘葵华报道：昨天清晨，鹰潭—厦门铁路铺轨工程已铺过四百六十二公里，通过了闽南闽北分水岭戴云山峰岭。铺轨工程列车，正顺着下坡驶向戴云山关键工区最后一段复杂工程地带。这里在十多公里内，没有一尺可以利用的较平坦的地方，线路一直在峻岭和深谷中通过，铁道兵战士和福建民工就在离谷底高达百公尺左右的山腰和悬崖陡壁上一钎一锤地把路基开凿出来。火车通过这段工区后，除要越过厦门海峡外，大都是在山势较平缓的闽南丘陵地带和九龙江平原。
    鹰厦线铺轨工程是8月27日开始向分水岭前进的，六天来，铁道兵铺轨大军在每公里爬高十九到二十二公尺的高坡上，仍以平均每天二公里多的速度前进，1日清晨铺轨工程列车离开分水岭北面最后一个小站，向分水岭驰去。“前面就是分水岭制高点，加油吧！同志们！”战士们互相鼓励着。拉轨班在向最后一段高坡前进时，四、五分钟就把装着十二根钢轨的车子拉上前去，铁路快速地向峰岭伸展。电影摄影师跑步奔上，把一个个激动人心的场面摄进镜头。下午6时，火车在亲手劈开分水岭英雄们的热烈欢呼声中，开过写有“英雄劈开分水岭，火车穿过万重山”的欢迎彩门，徐徐进入七百公尺长、二十多公尺深的分水岭火车通道，列车响起了汽笛，向闽南挺进。火车的浓烟，第一次飘游在戴云山群峰上空。
    戴云山闽南闽北分水岭，横跨在福建省中部永安、大田等县的边界，闽江和九龙江的好几条支流就发源这里，千百条涧溪向南北流去，高岭南北是一片原始林带。长期以来，很少有人踏进这里。带领铁道兵战士来过这里的一位铁道兵上校红军老战士刘正赓告诉记者说：这回是他第二次翻越这带山区了，去年底来查勘线路时，这里连一条崎岖山道也没有，在高山密林中，每天只能前进六百公尺，有时人在前面走，兽在后面跟，他们就赶走了野兽，继续前进。战士们说：想到长征两万五千里，今天修路不算苦。
