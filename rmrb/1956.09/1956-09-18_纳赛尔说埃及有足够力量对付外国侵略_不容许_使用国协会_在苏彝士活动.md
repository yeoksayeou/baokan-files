Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 17th - Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser told reporters from the Indian Press Trust in Cairo on the evening of September 16th: "We will never allow the Western-proposed Suez Canal Users' Association to perform duties in the Suez Canal."

Nasser, in answering questions from the Indian Press Trust correspondent in Cairo, also said: "It is difficult to say what the next development will be. But I can tell you this: the Suez Canal is Egyptian, and we will never give up any part of Egyptian territory."

The Egyptian President said: "We Egyptians will manage the canal smoothly and effectively. If the Canal Users' Association insists on forcibly passing through the Suez Canal regardless of this situation, then this will mean aggression and will be treated as aggression."

Nasser said: Egypt today is fully prepared and able to cope with aggression from any source.

He added: Egypt has no intention of aggression, but if any country commits aggression against it, Egypt will show that it has enough armed and heavily equipped troops to deal with such aggression.

A reporter asked if he thought the Suez crisis could lead to war. Nasser replied, "I don't know. As the person in charge, I must be prepared. I cannot simply regard the West's aggressive statements as threats."

The Egyptian President also said that he believed the Menzies delegation came to Cairo with "fixed ideas." This delegation "had no intention of reaching a negotiated solution at all" but wanted Egypt to "blindly accept the Dulles Plan."

Nasser pointed out that the West's biggest fear is that if it fails on the Suez issue, it will be driven out of the Arab world. He said that it is precisely the current Suez issue dispute that has made the Arab world unprecedentedly united.

When asked to comment on the Baghdad Pact, Nasser said, "I think it died before it was born. The West's attempt to bind the Arab world to the Baghdad Pact has failed miserably."

Nasser also expressed bewilderment at the United States' attitude on the Suez issue in the conversation.

    纳赛尔说埃及有足够力量对付外国侵略
    不容许“使用国协会”在苏彝士活动
    新华社新德里17日电　埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔9月16日晚在开罗对印度报业托辣斯的记者说：“我们决不容许西方建议的运河使用国协会在苏彝士运河行使职务”。
    纳赛尔在回答印度报业托辣斯驻开罗记者的问题的时候还说：“很难说下一步发展是什么。但是，我可以告诉你这一点。苏彝士运河是埃及的，我们决不放弃埃及领土的任何部分”。
    埃及总统说：“我们埃及人将顺利地和有效地管理运河，如果不顾这种情况，运河使用国协会还是要强行通过苏彝士运河，那么这就将意味着侵略，并且将被当作侵略对待”。
    纳赛尔说：埃及今天已经有充分准备并且能够应付不论来自何方的侵略。
    他又说：埃及没有侵略意图，但是，如果任何国家对它进行侵略，埃及将表明它有足够的拥有武装和重型装备的军队来对付这种侵略。
    记者问，他是否认为苏彝士危机可能导致战争。纳赛尔回答说：“我不知道。作为负责人，我必须有所准备，我不能把西方的侵略性的声明仅仅当作是威胁来看待”。
    埃及总统还说：他认为孟席斯代表团是抱着“固定的想法”来到开罗的。这个代表团“根本不打算达成通过谈判产生的解决办法”，而是要埃及“盲目接受杜勒斯计划”。
    纳赛尔指出，西方最担心的是，如果它在苏彝士问题上失败，它就会被赶出阿拉伯世界。他说正是目前的苏彝士问题的纠纷使得阿拉伯世界空前地团结起来。
    在被要求对巴格达条约发表意见的时候，纳赛尔说，“我认为它还没有生下来就死了，西方打算把阿拉伯世界束缚在巴格达条约上的企图已经悲惨地失败了。”
    纳赛尔在谈话中还对美国在苏彝士问题上的态度表示迷惑不解。
