Comrades, on behalf of the British Communist Party, our delegation expresses our warm and fraternal congratulations to the Congress with pride and honor.

Your Congress will record a series of epoch-making achievements that have not only transformed the lives of hundreds of millions of Chinese people but also contributed to the formation of the new world situation in which we meet today.

China has shaken off the shackles of imperialism and established a government that truly represents the people. This great nation is rapidly advancing towards socialism. This is one of the greatest events of the twentieth century, and indeed one of the greatest events in history.

There are some foolish and blind people in the world who want to ignore the facts and deny reality. They pretend as if the Chinese revolution never happened. They vainly attempt to deny the existence of the People's Republic of China. They fantasize that they can once again place the shackles of imperialism on the Chinese people.

To these people—and there are a few of them in Britain—we say that they are not worthy to be called true politicians. Their prejudice and hatred of the people have blinded them, completely separating them from reality.

These reactionaries exist, but they are becoming increasingly unpopular. Hundreds of millions of ordinary people around the world, including the working people of Britain, have always regarded the victory of the Chinese people as something to celebrate.

The working people of Britain have always had warm and friendly feelings towards the Chinese people. When Chinese workers resisted the attacks of foreign oppressors and domestic reactionaries, the British labor movement repeatedly expressed its support and solidarity.

Many of you know of the efforts made by our old comrade Tom Mann in this regard, and the work he did for the cause of Anglo-Chinese friendship in the 1920s.

Today, the friendship between our two peoples is more important than ever. International tensions have eased, but serious dangers still threaten world peace.

This danger is particularly due to the attitude of Britain and other imperialists, who oppose the liberation struggles of colonial peoples and try to stop them from advancing by force.

The attitude of Britain and France towards the Suez Canal issue is indicative of this intention.

This also explains why British imperialism's policy in Cyprus is so barbaric and cruel. In Kenya, colonialists have massacred thousands of Africans and imprisoned tens of thousands.

In Malaya, they have committed appalling crimes against the Malayan people. Headhunting Dayaks, chemical weapons, and bombs have all been used to prevent the Malayan people from obtaining basic trade union rights and democratic rights.

The vast majority of people in Britain oppose the belligerent policy adopted by the Conservative government towards Egypt for safeguarding its legitimate rights by nationalizing the Suez Canal Company.

We believe that the British people will never support any measures that use force against the Egyptian people. Just as the British people have the right to nationalize their resources, the Egyptian people have the same right.

British colonialists in Egypt will meet the same fate as they did in India, Pakistan, and Burma.

Now, no force in the world can prevent the peaceful development of all countries that have shaken off the shackles of imperialism, nor can any force prevent the people of all colonies around the world from winning national liberation and independence.

We believe that this attempt to continue the policy of colonial oppression is doomed to failure. This attempt not only violates the interests of the colonial peoples but, first and foremost, violates the greatest interests of the British people. It is the working people who sacrifice their lives, and it is they who bear the consequences of heavier taxes and lower living standards caused by these wars, while the big monopoly capitalists profit from colonial exploitation. The British people and the colonial peoples have common interests and a common enemy. They need to wage a common struggle against the imperialism that oppresses them.

Our own national independence is linked to the struggle of the colonial peoples for independence. Because, due to the policies adopted by British imperialism, American troops and aircraft are also stationed on British soil, and British policy is greatly influenced by the attitude of American imperialists.

This is reflected in the fact that the British government has not made any effort for the People's Republic of China to enter the United Nations, a demand supported by the vast majority of the British people.

This is reflected in the fact that the British government has accepted the measures instigated by the United States to prohibit trade between East and West, which seriously hinders the development of the British economy and is largely the cause of the current economic difficulties of some industries such as the British automobile industry.

We oppose the Conservative government's domestic and foreign policies. These policies are causing increasing difficulties for the British people—rising prices, wages not allowed to increase, higher rents, and reduced social services. We are working to unite the entire labor movement and the working class movement to fight against the Conservative Party and against capitalism.

The British labor movement is the most powerful labor movement in the capitalist world. With unity and correct policies, it can use its strength to defeat the Conservative Party and move towards socialism.

We cheer for the glorious victory of the Chinese people, also because we embrace this socialist goal inherited from the pioneers of socialism. The Soviet state was born in 1917. This first socialist country is a beacon and inspiration to workers and peasants all over the world, convincing them that socialism can be built and proving that it is superior to capitalism.

Now, together with the Soviet Union, there are also the People's Democracies of Eastern Europe and China.

These countries are heading towards a bright future with hope and confidence. They are the most powerful defenders of peace. The policies they adopt are in the interests of all progressive humanity.

The British people will one day decide that the time has come to end the rule of capitalists and landlords and to move towards socialism along the British path. We believe that such a day is not far off.

To bring that day closer, we in Britain will do everything we can to improve and strengthen our Party, the Communist Youth League, and the "Daily Worker" as an indispensable basis for working-class unity.

We know that your Congress will further inspire and guide the great Chinese people towards new victories for peace and socialism. Therefore, we congratulate this Congress from the bottom of our hearts with warm, sincere, and comradely feelings.

Long live peace and the friendship between the British and Chinese people!
Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the Communist Party of China! (Attached picture)

### 英国共产党代表团团长波立特同志致词

    英国共产党代表团团长波立特同志致词
    我们代表团怀着自豪和荣幸的心情代表英国共产党向大会表达我们热烈的、兄弟的祝贺。
    你们的代表大会将会把一系列的划时代的成就记载下来，这些成就不仅改变了亿万中国人民的生活，而且对于我们今天见面时所处的崭新的世界形势的形成也有贡献。
    中国摆脱了帝国主义的束缚，建立了真正代表人民的政府，这个伟大的国家正向着社会主义迅速前进。这是二十世纪最伟大的事件之一，也确实是历史上最伟大的事件之一。
    世界上有一些愚蠢和盲目的人想无视事实和否认现实。他们装作好像中国革命并没有发生过。他们妄想否认中华人民共和国的存在。他们幻想他们能够把帝国主义的枷锁再一次套在中国人民的身上。
    对于这种人——在英国也有少数这样一些人——我们要告诉他们，他们不配称为真正的政治家。他们对人民的偏见和憎恨蒙蔽了他们，使他们完全脱离了现实。
    这些反动分子是有的，但是他们越来越不得人心。世界上亿万普通人民，包括英国的劳动人民在内，不论过去和现在，都把中国人民的胜利看作一件值得欢呼庆贺的事情。
    英国的劳动人民始终对中国人民怀着热烈的友好的感情。当中国工人抵抗外国压迫者和国内反动派的进攻的时候，英国劳工运动曾屡次表示支持和声援。
    你们许多人都知道我们的老同志汤姆·曼在这方面所作的努力，知道他在二十年代为英中友谊的事业所作的工作。
    今天，我们两国人民的友谊比任何时候都更加重要了。国际紧张局势已经有了缓和，但是严重的危险仍旧威胁着世界和平。
    这种危险是特别由于英国和其他帝国主义者的态度所引起的，他们反对殖民地人民的解放斗争，竭力要用武力来阻止他们前进。
    英国和法国对苏彝士运河问题所抱的态度，就是这样的用意。
    这也说明了，英帝国主义在塞浦路斯的政策为什么那样野蛮和残忍。在怯尼亚，殖民主义者屠杀了成千的非洲人，并把成万的人关进监牢。
    在马来亚，他们对马来亚人民犯下了骇人的罪行。猎取人头的达亚克人、化学武器和炸弹，都被他们用来阻止马来亚人民取得起码的工会权利和民主权利。
    英国绝大多数人民是反对保守党政府由于埃及维护自己的合法权利、把苏彝士运河公司收归国有而对埃及所采取的好战政策的。
    我们相信，英国人民决不会支持对埃及人民使用武力的任何措施。正如英国人民有权利把他们的资源收归国有一样，埃及人民也有同样的权利。
    英国殖民主义者在埃及将遭到他们在印度、巴基斯坦和缅甸所遭到的同样的命运。
    现在，世界上没有任何力量能够阻止一切摆脱了帝国主义枷锁的国家的和平发展，也没有任何力量能够阻止全世界各殖民地的人民赢得民族解放和独立。
    我们相信，这种继续实行殖民压迫政策的企图，是注定要失败的。这种企图不仅违反了殖民地人民的利益，而且首先违反了英国人民的最大利益。牺牲性命的是劳动人民，这些战争使得赋税加重，生活水平降低，这后果也都由他们承担，而大垄断资本家却从殖民地剥削中取得了利润。英国人民和殖民地人民有着共同的利益和共同的敌人。他们需要进行共同的斗争来反对压迫他们的帝国主义。
    我们自己的民族独立是和殖民地人民争取独立的斗争联系着的。因为，由于英帝国主义所采取的政策，在英国自己的土地上也驻扎了美国的军队和飞机，英国的政策大大地受到美帝国主义者态度的影响。
    这表现在英国政府没有为中华人民共和国的进入联合国出过任何力气，而中华人民共和国的进入联合国是绝大多数英国人民所支持的要求。
    这表现在英国政府接受了美国所策动的禁止东西方贸易的措施，这严重地妨碍了英国经济的发展，并且在很大的程度上是目前英国汽车工业等一些工业经济困难的原因。
    我们反对保守党政府的对内和对外政策。这些政策给英国人民造成了日益加深的困难——物价上涨，工资不让增加，房租加高，社会服务事业减少。我们正在努力团结整个的劳工运动和工人阶级运动，为反对保守党和反对资本主义而斗争。
    英国的劳工运动是资本主义世界里最强有力的劳工运动。只要有了团结和正确的政策，它就可以用它的力量打败保守党并且向社会主义迈进。
    我们为中国人民的辉煌胜利而欢呼，这也是因为我们抱着从社会主义先驱者们继承下来的这个社会主义目标。一九一七年苏维埃国家诞生了。这个第一个社会主义国家是全世界工人和农民的灯塔和鼓舞力量，使他们确信社会主义是能够建设起来的，而且证明它比资本主义优越。
    现在同苏联在一起的，又有了东欧的人民民主国家和中国。
    这些国家正怀着希望和信心走向一个光辉灿烂的未来。它们是和平的最有力的保卫者。它们所采取的政策符合全体进步人类的利益。
    英国人民总有一天也会作出决定：结束资本家和地主的统治并沿着英国的道路走向社会主义的时候已经到来。我们相信这样的一天已经不远了。
    为了使这一天早日来临，我们在英国的人将尽一切力量来改进和加强我们党、共产主义青年团和“工人日报”，作为工人阶级团结所不可缺少的基础。
    我们知道你们的代表大会将更进一步鼓舞和引导伟大的中国人民走向和平和社会主义的新胜利。因此我们从心坎里怀着热烈的、真挚的、同志的感情祝贺这次代表大会。
    和平和英中人民的友谊万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！（附图片）
