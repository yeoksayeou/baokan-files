According to the Xi'an Daily News: Xi'an will build three new, large-scale factories. A modern instrument factory – the Xi'an Instrument Factory – will have a main factory building of tens of thousands of square meters. Once completed, this factory will produce various industrial instruments that China was previously unable to produce.

    According to the preliminary design, this factory will be basically completed in 1958 and put into production in 1959. Currently, various preparatory tasks are actively underway, and construction is expected to begin in October.

    The Xi'an High-Voltage Electrical Porcelain Factory, being built in Xi'an, is currently undergoing preparations for construction. The production equipment of this factory will all be modern. Several major workshops – the clay refining workshop, the blank making workshop, the tunnel kiln, etc. – will all be produced in a fully automated manner. Production workers, under complete protective equipment, will operate modern machines to produce a variety of high-voltage porcelain parts, many of which China cannot currently produce.

    In addition, a new, large-scale Xi'an Film Studio will soon begin construction.

    The technological design of the Xi'an Film Studio is being carried out under the specific guidance of Soviet experts, and the machinery and all equipment are the latest, most of which are domestically produced.

    After the Xi'an Film Studio is completed in 1958, it can produce various films such as science education, newsreels, documentary films, animation, and feature films. This factory can be basically completed in 1957, at which time it can produce some science education films and newsreels.

    西安筹建三座现代化大工厂
    据西安日报讯　西安将兴建三座新型的大工厂。一座现代化的仪表厂——西安仪表厂的主厂房约有数万平方公尺，这个厂建成以后将生产我国过去不能生产的各种工业上用的仪表。
    按照初步设计，这座厂子在1958年基本上建成，1959年投入生产。目前，正在积极进行各项筹建工作，10月份即可动工。
    在西安市兴建的西安高压电瓷厂正在进行建厂准备工作。这个厂子的生产设备都是现代化的。几个主要车间——炼泥车间、制坯车间、燧道窑等都要按着完全自动化的方式生产，生产工人们在完整的防护设备的条件下，操纵着现代化的机器，生产出各式各样的高压瓷件，其中有许多种我国目前还不能生产。
    另外，一座新型的规模巨大的西安电影制片厂，也快要动工兴建。
    西安电影制片厂的工艺技术设计是在苏联专家具体指导下进行的，机器及一切设备都是最新式的，其中大都是国产品。
    西安电影制片厂1958年建成后，可出产科学教育、新闻纪录、文献纪录、动画、故事等各种影片。1957年这个厂子可以基本建成，那时即可出产部分科学教育片和新闻片。
