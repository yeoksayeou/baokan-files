    Rapeseed and "Victory Rapeseed"
    Rapeseed is one of China's important oil crops, accounting for about one-third of the total area of oil crops in the country. It is widely distributed and cultivated in all areas except the Northeast. The Yangtze River basin and the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou are concentrated production areas, accounting for more than 85% of the total rapeseed production. Among them, Sichuan has the largest rapeseed planting area and the highest yield. Because rapeseed matures early and is easy to rotate, it is an excellent pre-crop for double and triple cropping areas. Nationwide, rapeseed can be sown in all seasons.

    Rapeseed has a long cultivation history in China. It is recorded in the book "Qi Min Yao Shu." There are many varieties of rapeseed. At present, rapeseed cultivated in China can be roughly divided into three types: tall rapeseed, dwarf rapeseed, and Japanese rapeseed. Dwarf rapeseed is the most common type of rapeseed in China. It is a variant of Chinese cabbage. Most of the varieties cultivated in the Sichuan Plain and the rice-producing areas of the Yangtze River basin belong to this type. Dwarf rapeseed seeds are relatively large, and the yield and oil content are higher than tall rapeseed. Tall rapeseed is a unique type of rapeseed in China, with strong resistance to diseases, pests, and drought. It is mostly cultivated in hilly areas. Japanese rapeseed has strong plants, is resistant to fertilizer and diseases, and has a high yield. It is suitable for cultivation in rice areas.

    Among these three types, each type has many excellent varieties. "Victory Rapeseed" is an outstanding excellent variety belonging to the Japanese rapeseed type.

    "Victory Rapeseed" was introduced to China around the time of the War of Resistance Against Japan. The Suining Cotton Farm in Sichuan Province was the first to plant it. At that time, because it was felt that its maturity was relatively late, and it conflicted with the local cotton planting, it was eliminated after being planted for a short time. However, local farmers saw that it could resist downy mildew (a devastating disease in rapeseed) and were not only not eliminated, but also selected and cultivated it. The fact that "Victory Rapeseed" is now an excellent variety with high yield, high oil content, and high disease resistance is inseparable from their hard work.

    "Victory Rapeseed" began to be valued and promoted after liberation. "Victory Rapeseed" has not only received extremely high evaluations in Sichuan, but also been warmly welcomed by farmers in the production areas of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Anhui and other provinces in the Yangtze River basin. According to statistics in 1955, the cultivated area of ​​"Victory Rapeseed" was about 3 million mu, about 100 times more than the 30,000 mu in 1954.

      Why is “Victory Rapeseed” so popular? What are its advantages?

    Downy mildew in the Sichuan rapeseed production area is a serious disease of local rapeseed. The plants die in patches after being affected by the disease. However, "Victory Rapeseed" has a high resistance to this disease. In 1954, downy mildew occurred in many areas of Santai County, Sichuan. The local rapeseed around the "Victory Rapeseed" fields died in patches, and even individual plants of other varieties interspersed in the "Victory Rapeseed" fields could not escape, while the "Victory Rapeseed" was still able to grow healthily without any signs of disease.

    When severe frost damage occurred in the Yangtze River basin in early 1955, wheat and other spring crops suffered a lot of yield reduction due to frost damage, and some other varieties of rapeseed mostly died from frost, but the "Victory Rapeseed" in this area withstood the test of severe cold without being harmed.

    "Victory Rapeseed" also has the characteristic of high yield. Last year, the ordinary rapeseed planted by the October Agricultural Cooperative in Xishui, Hubei, yielded an average of 75 jin per mu, while the "Victory Rapeseed" planted under the same conditions yielded an average of 126 jin per mu.

    The Southwest Agricultural Science Research Institute has initially selected new strains from "Victory Rapeseed." The maturity period of this new strain of "Victory Rapeseed" can be advanced by about ten days. The disadvantage of the long growing period of "Victory Rapeseed" will be overcome with the emergence of this new strain. (Jiang Shenghe)

### 油菜和“胜利油菜”

    油菜和“胜利油菜”
    油菜是我国重要油料作物的一种，约占全国油料作物总面积的三分之一左右。它的分布地区很广，除东北外，各地都有栽培。长江流域和云南、贵州等省为集中产区，约占油菜总产量85％以上。其中以四川油菜播种面积最大，产量也最高。油菜因为成熟期较早，容易实行轮栽，因此是两熟、三熟地区的优良前作物。在全国范围来讲，油菜一年四季都可播种。
    油菜在我国栽培历史很久。“齐民要术”一书中即有关于油菜的记载。油菜品种很多。目前我国栽培的油菜大体上可分为高油菜、矮油菜、日本油菜三个类型。矮油菜是我国最常见的一种油菜，是白菜的变种，在四川平原及长江流域水稻产区所栽培的品种，大部分属于这种类型。矮油菜种子比较大，产量及含油量都比高油菜高。高油菜是我国特有的油菜种类，抗病虫和抗旱力较强，丘陵地区栽培较多。日本油菜植株健壮，耐肥、抗病力强，产量高，宜于水稻地区栽培。
    在这三个类型中，每个类型都有很多的优良品种。“胜利油菜”是属于日本油菜类型中一个突出的优良品种。
    “胜利油菜”引入中国，大约是在抗日战争期间。最初种植它的是四川省的遂宁棉场。当时因为觉得它成熟期比较晚，和当地棉花播种有矛盾，没有种多少时间就被淘汰了。但是当地农民看到它能够抵抗毒素病（油菜中毁灭性的病害）和霜霉病，不但没有随着淘汰，并且加以选择和培育。“胜利油菜”目前成为一个产量高，含油率高、有高度抗病能力的优良品种，和他们的辛勤劳动分不开的。
    “胜利油菜”为人们重视并加以推广，是从解放以后开始的。“胜利油菜”不仅在四川得到极高的评价，在长江流域的湖南、湖北、江西、浙江、安徽等省的产区也受到农民热烈的欢迎。据1955年统计，“胜利油菜”的栽培面积约有三百多万亩，比1954年的三万亩约增加一百倍。
      “胜利油菜”为什么这样受人欢迎呢？它有些什么优点呢？
    四川油菜产区的毒素病是当地油菜的一种严重病害。油菜受病后植株成片死亡。可是“胜利油菜”对于这种病具有高度的抵抗能力。1954年四川三台县很多地区发生了毒素病和霜霉病。“胜利油菜”田四周的本地油菜成片死亡，甚至夹在“胜利油菜”田中的个别其他品种植株也不能幸免，而“胜利油菜”仍然能够健壮地生长，毫无受病的象征。
    1955年初长江流域发生严重冻害的时候，小麦等小春受冻减产很多，一些其他品种的油菜大部冻死，可是这一带的“胜利油菜”却经得住严寒的考验而没有受害。
    “胜利油菜”还有产量高的特点。去年湖北浠水十月农业社种植的普通油菜，每亩平均产七十五斤，在同样条件下种的“胜利油菜”每亩平均产量是一百二十六斤。
    西南农业科学研究所已经初步从“胜利油菜”中选出新品系。这种新品系的“胜利油菜”的成熟期能够提早十天左右。“胜利油菜”生长期较长的缺点，将要随着这个新品系的出现而克服。（蒋声和）
