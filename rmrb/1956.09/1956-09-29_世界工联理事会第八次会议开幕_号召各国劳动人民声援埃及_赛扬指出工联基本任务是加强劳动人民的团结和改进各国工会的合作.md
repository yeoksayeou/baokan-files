Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: TASS reports: The eighth session of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Council opened in Sofia on September 27th. Representatives from trade union organizations in forty-one countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America are participating in the meeting.

After the opening address by WFTU President Vittorio, the meeting adopted the following agenda:

	I. Taking effective measures to meet the urgent social and economic demands of the working people and developing new forces conducive to achieving the unity of the world trade union movement;

	II. Fraternal solidarity in the anti-colonial struggle of trade union movements and working people in countries that have achieved independence or are striving for independence;

	III. On the use of the WFTU International Solidarity Fund;

	IV. On the issue of convening the Fourth World Trade Union Congress;

	V. Report of the Inspection Committee.

The meeting unanimously adopted a letter to trade unions and working people of all countries on the Suez Canal issue.

Subsequently, WFTU General Secretary Louis Saillant delivered a report on the first agenda item.

Louis Saillant's report first addressed the important historical role played by the working class in the lives of various countries and in international life. He said that the role of trade unions, as mass organizations of the working class, is growing. Currently, approximately 160 million working people worldwide are members of trade unions. They belong to the WFTU, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions, as well as various autonomous and independent trade union organizations.

Louis Saillant emphasized that despite belonging to different trade union organizations, working people in various countries share common interests and demands, and on this basis, international trade union solidarity can be strengthened.

Working people everywhere strive to stop the arms race and protect the right to self-determination and democratic freedoms of all peoples. These common demands are a solid foundation for the broad unity of working people.

When discussing the tasks facing the WFTU, Louis Saillant said that the basic tasks of the WFTU now are to strengthen the solidarity of working people and improve cooperation among trade unions in various countries. The WFTU will be an organization that constantly supports the actions of working people and mobilizes the forces of unity within the working class.

Xinhua News Agency, September 28th, Sofia dispatch from TASS: The eighth session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council on September 27th adopted a letter to trade unions and working people of all countries on the Suez Canal issue, calling on national trade unions in all countries and all international trade union organizations to completely crush the schemes of the colonialists on the Suez Canal issue; block the path of imperialists' conspiracies to engage in military adventures; and support Egypt. The letter stated, "We should seek a peaceful resolution to the Suez Canal issue, proceeding from the interests of Egypt's sovereignty and peace."

In the letter to trade unions and working people of all countries, the WFTU Council, representing 88 million working people, expressed fraternal solidarity with the Egyptian people who are defending their national independence and state sovereignty, and strongly condemned the economic pressure and war preparations being imposed on Egypt, believing that this is an attempt to maintain colonialist positions in the Near East and the Middle East and a threat of military intervention in this independent country. This practice is, in any case, unacceptable.

"Therefore, the World Federation of Trade Unions Council calls on the governments of all countries concerned with the normal navigation conditions on the Suez Canal to take all necessary measures to seek a solution to this issue through peaceful negotiations."

The WFTU Council expressed its warm respect to the working people and trade unions of Egypt and other Arab countries who firmly oppose foreign attempts to interfere in Egypt's internal affairs.

    世界工联理事会第八次会议开幕
    号召各国劳动人民声援埃及
    赛扬指出工联基本任务是加强劳动人民的团结和改进各国工会的合作
    据新华社28日讯　据塔斯社报道：世界工会联合会理事会第八次会议9月27日在索非亚开幕。参加会议的有欧洲、亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的四十一个国家的工会组织的代表。
    世界工联主席维多里奥致开幕词以后，会议通过议程如下：
    一、采取有效措施以满足劳动人民迫切的社会和经济要求，发展有利于实现世界工会运动的团结的新力量；
    二、已经争取到独立、或者正在争取独立的国家的工会运动和劳动人民在反殖民主义斗争中的兄弟团结；
    三、关于世界工联国际团结基金的使用情况；
    四、关于召开第四次世界工会代表大会的问题；
    五、检查委员会的报告。
    会议一致通过了就苏伊士运河问题告各国工会和劳动人民书。
    接着，世界工联总书记路易·赛扬就第一项议程作了报告。
    路易·赛扬的报告首先讲到工人阶级在各国的生活中和在国际生活中所起的重要历史作用。他说，作为工人阶级群众性组织的工会的作用日益增长了。目前，全世界约有一亿六千万劳动人民参加了工会。他们分别属于世界工会联合会、国际自由工会联合会、基督教工会国际联合会以及各个自主的和独立的工会组织。
    路易·赛扬着重指出，尽管属于不同的工会组织，各国劳动人民有着共同的利益和要求，在这个基础上可以加强工会的国际团结。
    各地劳动人民力求阻止军备竞赛、保护各族人民的自决权和民主自由。这些共同要求是劳动人民广泛团结的巩固基础。
    在谈到世界工联所面临的任务时，路易·赛扬说，现在世界工联的基本任务是加强劳动人民的团结和改进各国工会的合作。世界工联将是一个经常支持劳动人民的行动、发动工人阶级内部的团结力量的组织。
    据新华社28日讯　据塔斯社索非亚讯：世界工会联合会理事会第八次会议27日就苏伊士运河问题通过了告各国工会和劳动人民书，号召所有国家的全国性工会和所有国际工会组织在苏伊士运河问题上彻底粉碎殖民主义者的阴谋；堵塞帝国主义者阴谋从事军事冒险的道路；支持埃及。这个文告说，“我们从埃及的主权和和平的利益考虑出发，应当求得苏伊士运河问题的和平解决。”
    世界工联理事会在告各国工会和劳动人民书中代表八千八百万劳动人民对捍卫自己的民族独立和国家主权的埃及人民表示兄弟的声援，并且坚决谴责对埃及施加的经济压力和备战措施，认为这是企图在近东和中东保持殖民主义的阵地，是对这个独立国家进行军事干涉的威胁。这种做法，无论如何是不能容许的。
    “因此，世界工会联合会理事会呼吁一切关心苏伊士运河上通航状况正常的国家的政府采取各种必要措施，以求用和平谈判的办法来解决这个问题”。
    世界工联理事会向坚决反对外国企图干涉埃及内政的埃及和其他阿拉伯国家的劳动人民和工会表示热烈的敬意。
