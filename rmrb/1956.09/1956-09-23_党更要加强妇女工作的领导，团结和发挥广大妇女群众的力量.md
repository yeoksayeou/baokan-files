Comrade Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, spoke:

I fully agree with Comrade Mao Zedong's opening address and the three reports made by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhou Enlai on behalf of the Party Central Committee, as well as the draft of the Party Constitution and the proposals regarding the Second Five-Year Plan. Now, I would like to express some opinions on uniting and giving play to the strength of the broad masses of women to build our country into a great socialist nation.

The eleven years from the Party's Seventh National Congress to the Eighth National Congress have been the most magnificent period in Chinese history. During this period, under the correct leadership of our Party, the people of the whole country thoroughly completed the bourgeois democratic revolution, achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution, and are now carrying out socialist construction. In the process of revolution and construction, the Party has attached great importance to the strength and revolutionary demands of the masses of women, put forward the principle of mobilizing both men and women together, and formulated specific tasks for women's work based on the general tasks of the revolution and the central tasks of each period, so that women's work could be closely integrated with the overall revolutionary work. The Party's guidelines and policies on women's work have been implemented through all links of the Party, thus more and more women have united around the Party and actively participated in the revolution and construction, enabling the women's movement to develop vigorously.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chinese women, together with all the people, became masters of the country. The Constitution guarantees women equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social, and family life, and protects marriage, family, mothers, and children. This is the result of the long-term struggle of the broad masses of women and all the people under the leadership of the Party. To realize these rights, the state has taken a series of concrete measures, and the masses of women have made great efforts. After the decisive victory of the socialist revolution, women's situation has undergone even more profound changes, presenting a new look unprecedented in history. The most significant aspect is that the vast majority of women across the country have been organized, are increasingly consciously embarking on the socialist road, and are actively participating in the socialist transformation and construction. More than two million female workers, over one hundred million peasant women, more than two million female handicraftsmen, and more than seven hundred thousand female cadres in various work positions have seen their labor enthusiasm soar to unprecedented levels, their labor skills gradually improve, and their demands for learning culture, technology, and science continuously increase. A large number of workers' dependents and handicraftsmen's dependents are striving to serve socialist construction from their families, from participating in grassroots political power, and from various social activities. Female industrialists and merchants and their dependents are striving to transform themselves into self-reliant laborers.

However, it cannot be assumed that the issue of women's liberation has been completely resolved in our society at present. To achieve the complete liberation of women, much more effort is needed. China was originally an economically and culturally backward country. At present, the majority of women are still illiterate, and there are very few female intellectuals. Generally speaking, women who have already participated in social labor have low professional knowledge and skills, and lack experience. Most of them have conflicts between participating in social labor and raising children and managing household chores. The ideas of belittling and discriminating against women, which were left over from the old society, are still reflected to varying degrees and quite universally in people's attitudes towards women and children and in all aspects of marriage and family life. If these problems are not gradually resolved, they will hinder the full发挥发挥 of the enthusiasm of the masses of women. Our Party must strengthen women's work even more. Therefore, I propose three points.

More extensively mobilize women to participate in socialist construction

First, at present, the task of our Party is to build our country into a great socialist nation. To this end, the central task of women's work is to more extensively mobilize women to participate in socialist construction from all aspects. Our Party Central Committee clearly stated in 1943 that mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of women to actively participate in labor production, improving their lives and raising the status of women on the basis of developing production, is the guideline for carrying out women's work after the people have grasped political power. More than ten years of practical experience have proved that this guideline is completely correct. In the revolutionary base areas before the nationwide liberation, due to the implementation of this guideline, women were widely mobilized to participate in labor production, which played a significant role in defeating the enemy, building the base areas, improving the people's lives, liberating women from feudal shackles, and raising women's social and family status. Now we should continue to implement this guideline, which is the key to strengthening the forces of socialist construction and striving for the complete liberation of women.

In order to meet the needs of the development of socialist construction, women must be absorbed into various social labor in a planned way. Women's labor force should be appropriately used in accordance with the overall labor force allocation plan and based on women's strengths and special circumstances, so as to make the best use of their talents. The labor departments in some places have, according to needs and possibilities, consulted with relevant units to rationally stipulate the proportion of male and female employees. Many agricultural production cooperatives, based on the need to increase production and the specific conditions of women, have unified planning and arrangements, absorbing a large number of women to participate in possible field labor and sideline production, giving play to women's strengths in many ways. These are all good experiences. However, there are still some places that have a tendency to underestimate or discriminate against the strength of women or use women's labor force improperly. For example, some units suitable for women's labor openly refuse to employ female employees or stipulate various "internal rules" to restrict women's employment; and some units ignore women's physiological characteristics and housework, and set labor targets for women that are too high, resulting in excessive tension in women's labor, which affects women's health. These deviations have attracted the attention of Party committees in various places, and it is hoped that they will be further and effectively corrected in the future.

While mobilizing women to participate in labor production, we must pay close attention and take effective measures to earnestly protect the safety, health, and due rights of women and children. For women who have already participated in social labor, the principle of equal pay for equal work must be resolutely implemented. In some joint state-private enterprises and agricultural production cooperatives, there are still phenomena of unequal pay for equal work between men and women, which hinders the发挥发挥 of women's labor enthusiasm. This issue should be strictly corrected when adjusting wages or improving the quota-based work system. In order to enable women to work in social labor with peace of mind, it is necessary to develop a wide variety of childcare organizations as much as possible, which is an urgent task at present. Currently, childcare organizations are mainly run by industrial and mining enterprises, institutions, schools, agriculture, and handicraft production cooperatives; however, attention should also be paid to social forces, relying on the masses to run mass childcare organizations. Urban street childcare organizations that are convenient for laboring women living in dispersed areas should be vigorously promoted, using the method of public-private partnership. The competent units of various childcare organizations should strengthen leadership, improve and develop their business in the spirit of diligence and thrift. Attention should be paid to the political and professional education of childcare workers, care for their lives and welfare, and meet their demands to join trade unions.

Under the current conditions in our country, housework is valuable and should be valued. In recent years, many housewives have been diligent and thrifty, managing their households well, raising their children well, supporting and encouraging their families to complete the country's construction tasks, and发挥发挥ing the special role of family members. In the future, we should universally strengthen our work among the dependents of workers, handicraftsmen, and industrialists and merchants. For women who have already participated in social labor or social activities, we should ensure that they have time to manage housework as much as possible; at the same time, we should pay attention to expanding social service undertakings to gradually meet the demands of the broad masses of women to reduce housework labor.

For the broad masses of women, whether or not they have participated in social labor, we should strengthen regular political education, especially helping them to obtain more learning opportunities and convenient conditions, so that they can continuously improve their socialist consciousness and raise their cultural level. Therefore, in the planning of developing education, attention should be paid to systematically eliminating illiteracy among women; in secondary and higher education institutions, the proportion of female students should be appropriately increased, absorbing a large number of young women to enroll. This is an important step to change the backward cultural status of women.

Further expand and consolidate the solidarity of women at home and abroad

Second, the issue of further expanding and consolidating the solidarity of women at home and abroad. The united front work among women is an aspect of the people's democratic united front work. During the Anti-Japanese War, our Party established cooperative relationships with representatives of patriotic and democratic women from all strata, democratic parties, and non-party figures. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, this solidarity has been further expanded. Through various aspects and through the cooperation of the Democratic Women's Federation with other women's organizations, we have more broadly united women of all ethnic groups, strata, democratic parties, and various religious beliefs. Especially in the high tide of the socialist revolution, the women's united front has been further consolidated and developed. Many women belonging to the national bourgeoisie, under the leadership of the Party, have raised their patriotic awareness through years of education, and under the encouragement of the policy of peacefully transforming capitalist industry and commerce, they have recognized that socialism is already the general trend and the path that the people's hearts desire, and thus accepted the transformation; they have become active factors within the bourgeoisie, playing a considerable role in promoting the acceptance of transformation by capitalist industrialists and merchants.

However, within our Party, there are still some women's work cadres who do not fully recognize the positive role played by the people's democratic united front in our country's revolutionary cause, or the significance and possibility of uniting and transforming women of all strata to serve socialism. In cooperating and working with non-Party women, they have many concerns: they are afraid of trouble, afraid of being tainted by bourgeois ideology, and afraid of losing their position and making mistakes, and therefore have not been able to warmly and patiently unite and help them. In addition, some Party women's work cadres have unconditionally accommodated them, abandoning the serious responsibility of helping them carry out self-transformation. These are all incorrect.

In the future, we must continue to consolidate and expand the women's united front. The Democratic Women's Federation is a women's united front organization under the leadership of the Party, and it is the broadest mass organization. It should always pay attention to absorbing new activists from all ethnic groups, strata, and democratic parties to participate in its work, and the proportion of non-Party women in its leading bodies should be appropriately increased. The Party member cadres in the Democratic Women's Federation should strengthen unity and cooperation with the non-Party leading backbone, earnestly correct sectarian ideological style, and in regular work and study, help each other, cooperate with each other, learn from each other, consult with each other on matters, treat each other with sincerity, give them positions and authority, create conditions for them to do their work well, and help them fully发挥发挥 their role.

In our country's revolution and socialist construction, we have received the sympathy and support of women in the Soviet Union, people's democratic countries, and women in all countries who love democracy and peace. In recent years, Chinese women have also actively participated in major international women's activities. At present, the All-China Women's Federation has established friendly relations with women in fifty-six countries. In the future, on this basis, we should further consolidate and develop ties with women in various countries, enhance mutual understanding and friendship, strengthen solidarity, protect the rights of women and children, and safeguard world peace.

Continue to strengthen the Party's leadership over women's work

Third, on the issue of the Party continuing to strengthen its leadership over women's work. Implementing the Party's guideline of doing women's work throughout the Party and comprehensively and systematically strengthening the Party's leadership over women's work is the basic key to doing women's work well. In recent years, many Party committees have already incorporated women's work into the Party committee's work plans, instructed relevant units to formulate specific steps, divide responsibilities and cooperate, jointly implement them, and regularly inspect women's work, summarize and promote experience, which enables women's work to be carried out in an all-round way, thereby also promoting work in various aspects. However, some Party committees do not provide sufficient regular and specific leadership for women's work, or only "manage it when they are approached," and do not pay attention to发挥发挥 the role of women's organizations. This situation should be improved. At the same time, it is even more necessary at present to establish and improve the Party's women's work departments, improve their work, and enable them to fulfill their responsibilities well.

In addition, the Party, Communist Youth League, and trade union organizations in state organs, industrial and mining enterprises, state-owned farms, and cooperatives must strengthen their leadership over women's work. Because more and more women and their dependents are working in these units, they all have special requirements, and these special requirements must be resolved with the development of work. It is recommended that the Party, Communist Youth League, and trade union organizations in various units (including grassroots organizations) set up specialized institutions or assign special personnel to be responsible for leading women's work as needed and as possible.

In this situation, are women's organizations still needed? We believe that they are still needed. Because women's mass organizations are products of certain social and historical conditions, and their historical task is to carry out specialized work among the masses of women, targeting the special problems of women. Therefore, their existence should be determined by the needs of social development and the masses of women, not by our subjective wishes. At present, the broad masses of women still have special problems, some women have not yet joined organizations, and they are not good at using their own rights. Therefore, they still need their own women's mass organizations to unite the strength of women, express women's demands, protect the rights of women and children, and supervise the implementation of policies and laws on equality between men and women. As for the work of friendly exchanges with women in various countries, it is an even longer-term task. Therefore, our Party still needs to continue to strengthen its leadership over democratic women's federations at all levels (including grassroots women's representative conferences), help them fully发挥发挥 their organizational role, and help them improve their working methods based on the current new situation and needs. In the high tide of the socialist revolution, some women's work cadres proposed to abolish women's grassroots organizations and underestimated the role of democratic women's federations at all levels. This idea is obviously inappropriate.

The Party Central Committee's guidelines and instructions on women's work are completely correct. However, because our leading organs for women's work have not studied the Party's instructions and policies sufficiently, do not fully recognize that going deep into the masses and going deep into reality is the key to improving the leadership style, do not care enough about the legitimate demands and sufferings of the masses of women reflected in various places, and have not been able to study and summarize the situation and experience of women's work in a timely manner; coupled with the fact that we lack experience in the face of the nationwide, rapidly developing, heavy and complex work, have not been able to arrange it well, have not been able to grasp the center, conduct systematic leadership, and are not good at发挥发挥ing collective strength and using the weapons of criticism and self-criticism, timely inspection, and correcting shortcomings, and have blindly been complacent when work has achieved slight success. Although we have inspected these shortcomings several times under the guidance and help of the Party Central Committee and have made some improvements, we have not seriously corrected them. Therefore, subjectivism and bureaucracy divorced from the masses and divorced from reality are still major shortcomings in our leadership of women's work. In the future, we must earnestly and conscientiously overcome these shortcomings and improve our work.

I believe that after the Party's Eighth National Congress, the Party's leadership over women's work will inevitably have significant improvements and strengthenings. This will surely be able to fully发挥发挥 the socialist enthusiasm and creativity of hundreds of millions of women to strive to build a great socialist China.

### 党更要加强妇女工作的领导，团结和发挥广大妇女群众的力量

专栏：

    党更要加强妇女工作的领导，团结和发挥广大妇女群众的力量
    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席　邓颖超同志的发言
    我完全同意毛泽东同志的开幕词和刘少奇、邓小平、周恩来同志代表党中央委员会所作的三个报告，以及党的章程草案和关于第二个五年计划的建议。现在，我特就团结和发挥广大妇女群众的力量，把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家这个问题，发表一些意见。
    从党的七次全国代表大会到八次全国代表大会的十一年，是我国历史上最伟大的时期。在这个期间，全国人民在我们党的正确领导下，彻底完成了资产阶级民主革命，取得了社会主义革命的决定性的胜利，正在进行着社会主义的建设。在革命和建设的过程中，党十分重视妇女群众的力量和革命要求，针对妇女群众的觉悟程度和特殊情况，提出了男女一齐发动的方针，并且根据革命的总任务和各个时期的中心任务，制定了妇女工作的具体任务，使妇女工作和整个革命工作密切结合。党在妇女工作上的方针和政策，通过全党各个环节贯彻执行，因而越来越多的妇女团结在党的周围，积极地参加了革命和建设，使妇女运动得以蓬勃地向前发展。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，中国妇女和全体人民一起做了国家的主人，宪法保障妇女在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭的生活各方面享有同男子平等的权利，并保护婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童，这是广大妇女群众和全体人民在党的领导下长期奋斗的结果。为实现这些权利，国家采取了一系列的具体措施，妇女群众又作了巨大的努力。在社会主义革命取得决定性的胜利以后，妇女的情况发生了更深刻的变化，出现了历史上前所未有的新面貌。最显著的是：全国绝大多数妇女已经组织起来，日益自觉地走上了社会主义道路，积极参加社会主义改造和建设事业。二百余万女职工，一亿多农妇，二百余万女手工业者，七十多万在各种工作岗位上的女干部，她们的劳动热情空前高涨，劳动能力逐步提高，学习文化、技术、科学的要求不断增涨。大批职工家属、手工业者家属正在从家庭中、从参加基层政权及各种社会活动中，努力为社会主义建设服务。女工商业者和工商业者的家属，正在努力转变为自食其力的劳动者。
    但是不能认为，在现时我国社会中，妇女解放问题已经完全解决了。为了实现妇女的彻底解放，还需要做很大的努力。我国原来是一个经济、文化落后的国家，现在，妇女群众中文盲还占多数，妇女知识分子很少。已经参加社会劳动的妇女，一般来说，业务知识和技能不高，经验不足，大部分人有参加社会劳动和教养子女料理家务之间的矛盾；旧社会遗留下来的轻视、歧视妇女的思想，仍旧不同程度地相当普遍地反映在人们对待妇女儿童的态度和婚姻、家庭生活的各方面。这些问题如果不逐步地来解决，就会障碍妇女群众充分地发挥积极性。我们党更要加强妇女工作。因此，我提出三点意见。
    更广泛地动员妇女参加社会主义建设
    第一，现时我们党的任务是把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，为此，妇女工作的中心任务是更广泛地动员妇女从各方面参加社会主义建设。我们党中央在一九四三年就明确地提出：动员和组织广大妇女群众积极地参加劳动生产，在发展生产的基础上，改善生活和提高妇女的地位，是人民掌握政权以后进行妇女工作的方针。十多年来实践经验证明，这一方针是完全正确的。在全国解放以前的革命根据地内，由于执行这一方针，广泛地发动了妇女参加劳动生产，曾对战胜敌人、建设根据地、改善人民生活、解除妇女的封建束缚、提高妇女的社会和家庭地位起过重大的作用。现在我们应当继续执行这个方针，这是增强建设社会主义的力量，争取妇女彻底解放的关键。
    为了适应社会主义建设事业发展的需要，必须有计划地吸收妇女参加各种社会劳动。应当按照整个劳动力调配的计划，根据妇女的特长和特殊情况，恰当地使用妇女劳动力，达到人尽其才。有些地方的劳动部门，已经按照需要和可能，和有关单位协商，合理地规定了男女职工的比例。不少农业生产合作社根据增产的需要和妇女的具体条件，统一规划安排，吸收了大量妇女分别参加可能参加的田间劳动和副业生产，从多方面发挥了妇女的特长。这些都是好的经验。但是有些地方还有轻视歧视妇女的力量或使用妇女劳动力不当的偏向。例如有些适合妇女劳动的单位，公然拒用女职工或规定种种“清规戒律”限制妇女就业；又有些单位忽视妇女的生理特点和家务劳动，过高地规定妇女的劳动指标，造成妇女劳动过度紧张的情况，以致影响妇女的健康。这些偏向已经引起各地党委的注意，希望今后更进一步地切实纠正。
    在发动妇女参加劳动生产的同时，必须密切注意并采取有效的措施，切实保护妇女儿童的安全、健康和应得的权益。对于已经参加社会劳动的妇女，应坚决贯彻男女同工同酬。在有些公私合营企业、农业生产合作社中，现在还有男女同工不同酬的现象，妨碍了妇女劳动积极性的发挥，这个问题应当在调整工资或改进定额计工制度时严加纠正。为了使妇女能够安心从事社会劳动，应当尽可能地大量地发展多种多样的托儿组织，这是当前的急务。目前主要依靠工矿企业、机关、学校、农业、手工业生产合作社举办托儿组织；可是，也应重视社会力量，依靠群众，举办群众性的托儿组织。对于便利于分散居住的劳动妇女的城市街道托儿组织，要大力提倡，采用民办公助的办法。各种托儿组织的主管单位要加强领导，本着勤俭精神改进并发展业务。注意对保育工作者的政治业务教育，关心她们的生活福利，满足她们加入工会的要求。
    在我国现在的条件下，家务劳动是有价值的，应当受到重视。几年来已经有很多家庭妇女，勤俭节约，搞好家务，教养好子女，支援并鼓励家人完成国家的建设任务，发挥了家属的特殊作用。今后我们应当普遍地加强对职工、手工业者、工商业者家属的工作。对于已经参加社会劳动或社会活动的妇女，应当尽可能保障她们有料理家务的时间；同时要注意扩展社会服务事业，逐步满足广大妇女减轻家务劳动的要求。
    对广大妇女，不论已否参加社会劳动，都应该加强经常的政治教育工作，尤其要帮助她们取得更多的学习的机会和便利条件，以便她们能够不断提高社会主义觉悟，提高文化水平。所以在发展教育事业的规划中，要注意有计划地扫除妇女文盲；在中等、高等学校中，要适当增加女学生的比例，吸收大量女青年入学。这是改变妇女文化落后状态的重要步骤。
    更加扩大和巩固国内外妇女的团结
    第二，更加扩大和巩固国内外妇女的团结问题。妇女中的统一战线工作是人民民主统一战线工作的一个方面。在抗日战争时期，我们党就和各阶层、各民主党派和无党派的爱国民主妇女中的代表人物建立了合作关系。中华人民共和国成立以后，这种团结就更加扩大了。我们通过各个方面、通过民主妇联同其他妇女团体的合作，更广泛地团结了各民族、各阶层、各民主党派、各种不同宗教信仰的妇女。特别是在社会主义革命高潮中，妇女统一战线就更加巩固和发展了。许多属于民族资产阶级的妇女，在党的领导下，经过几年来的教育，提高了她们的爱国主义觉悟，又在和平改造资本主义工商业的政策的鼓舞下，认识到社会主义已经是大势所趋，人心所向的道路，因而接受了改造；她们成为资产阶级内部的积极因素，对于促进资本主义工商业者接受改造起了相当大的作用。
    但是，在我们党内，还有些妇女工作干部，对人民民主统一战线在我国革命事业中所起的积极作用，对团结和改造各阶层妇女为社会主义服务的意义和可能认识不足。她们在和非党妇女合作共事中，有不少顾虑：怕麻烦，怕沾染资产阶级思想，怕失掉立场犯错误，因而没有能热忱地耐心地团结和帮助她们。另外，也有些党的妇女工作干部无原则地迁就，放弃了帮助她们进行自我改造的严肃责任。这些都是不对的。
    今后，必须继续巩固和扩大妇女统一战线。民主妇联是在党领导之下的妇女统一战线组织，是最广泛的群众组织，应当经常注意吸收各民族、各阶层、各民主党派妇女中新的积极分子参加工作，在它的领导机构中，非党妇女的比例应该适当增加。在民主妇联的党员干部应当加强和非党的领导骨干团结合作，切实纠正宗派主义的思想作风，对党外干部要在经常的工作和学习中，互助合作，互相学习，遇事协商，推诚相见，使她们有职有权，为她们作好工作创造条件，帮助她们充分发挥作用。
    在我国革命和社会主义建设事业中，得到苏联、人民民主国家的妇女以及世界各国爱好民主和平的妇女的同情和支援。这几年来我国妇女也积极地参加了国际妇女的重大活动，现在全国妇联已经和五十六个国家的妇女有了友好往来。今后要在这个基础上，更加巩固和发展同各国妇女之间的联系，增进相互的了解和友谊，加强团结，保卫妇女儿童权利，保卫世界和平。
    继续加强党对妇女工作的领导
    第三，关于党继续加强对妇女工作的领导问题。贯彻全党作妇女工作的方针，全面地有系统地加强党对妇女工作的领导，是作好妇女工作的基本关键。几年来有不少党委已经把妇女工作纳入党委的工作规划，责成有关单位订出具体步骤，分工合作，共同实现，并且定期地检查妇女工作，总结并推广经验，这就使妇女工作能够全面开展，从而也能够推进各方面的工作。但也有些党委，对妇女工作的领导不够经常和不够具体，或者只等“找上门来管一管”，不注意发挥妇女团体的作用。这种情况要注意改进。同时，建立和健全党的妇女工作部门，改进工作，使之善尽职责，目前更为必要。
    另外，国家机关、工矿企业、国营农场、合作社中的党、青年团和工会组织，必须加强对妇女工作的领导。因为在这些单位中工作的妇女和家属愈来愈多，她们都有特殊要求，这些特殊要求又须随着工作的发展，加以解决。建议各单位的党、青年团和工会的组织（包括基层组织在内），根据需要和可能分别设置专门机构或者专人负责领导妇女工作。
    在这种情况下，还要不要妇女团体呢？我们认为，还是需要的。因为妇女群众团体是一定社会历史条件下的产物，它的历史任务是针对妇女的特殊问题，在妇女群众中进行专门的工作。所以它的存在与否，应该决定于社会发展和妇女群众的需要，不决定于我们的主观愿望。现在广大妇女群众还有特殊问题，一部分妇女还没有参加组织，还不善于运用自身的权利。因此，她们仍然需要妇女群众自身的组织，团结妇女的力量，表达妇女的要求，保护妇女儿童的权益，监督男女平等政策法令的执行。至于和各国妇女友好往来的工作，更是长期的任务。所以，我们党仍旧要继续加强对各级民主妇联（包括基层妇女代表会议在内）的领导，帮助它充分发挥组织作用；并且帮助它根据当前新的情况和需要，改进工作方法。在社会主义革命高潮中，曾经有些妇女工作干部，提出要取消妇女基层组织，低估民主妇联各级组织的作用，这种想法显然是不妥当的。
    党中央对于妇女工作的方针和指示，是完全正确的。但是由于我们妇女工作的领导机关，对党的指示和政策钻研不够，对深入群众、深入实际是改进领导作风的关键认识不足，对各地反映的妇女群众的切身要求和疾苦关心不够，对妇女工作的情况和经验又未能及时地研究和总结；加上我们在全国规模的、迅速发展着的、繁重复杂的工作面前，缺乏经验，没有能够很好地安排，没有能够抓住中心，进行系统的领导，又不善于发挥集体力量和运用批评与自我批评的武器，及时检查，改正缺点，在工作稍有成绩时，又盲目自满。虽然我们在党中央的教导和帮助下，几度检查了这些缺点，有所改进，但没有认真纠正。因此，脱离群众、脱离实际的主观主义和官僚主义仍然是我们妇女工作领导上的重大缺点。今后我们必须切实认真地克服这些缺点，改进工作。
    我相信，在党的第八次代表大会以后，全党对妇女工作的领导，必然会有显著的改进和加强。这就一定能够充分地发挥亿万妇女群众的社会主义积极性和创造性，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义中国而奋斗。
