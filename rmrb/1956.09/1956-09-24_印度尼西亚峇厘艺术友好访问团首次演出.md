Xinhua News Agency, 23rd. Balinese dancers from Indonesia, in their first performance in China tonight, transported the audience to a new realm of art.

Although the Balinese people and the Chinese people began exchanges more than a thousand years ago, the vast majority of Chinese audiences are seeing Balinese dance with its distinctive national style for the first time.

Vice Premier of the State Council He Long, Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen, Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing and many famous figures in the art world came to watch the performance.

Also present at the performance were the Indonesian Ambassador to China, Wijopranoto, and diplomatic envoys from many countries to China.

The Beijing Tianqiao Theater, with more than 1,500 seats, was packed tonight, and many people stood and watched for two and a half hours. Dancer Dai Ailian, in commenting on Balinese dance, said: Balinese dance art has reached a high level of achievement, I never tire of watching it.

The stage setting was arranged according to Balinese scenery and traditional customs, with a background of lush green jungle, towering pagodas, and red Hindu temples. The actors wore brightly colored costumes and danced gracefully to the rhythmic and melodious ensemble of the "Gamelan" percussion band. Indonesian dancers performed nine programs tonight.

The classical dance "Pralambang," performed by Ni Lu Zha Wan, the most outstanding female dancer in southern Bali, and Ida Bagus Oga, the most outstanding male dancer, aroused great interest among the audience. This dance depicts a myth similar to the magpie bridge meeting of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl. The actors performed the special skills of Balinese dance - elegant and detailed hand gestures, changeable eyes, and soft limb movements. Ni Lu Zha Wan, thirty years old, is a farmer from Bali who has been participating in amateur dance activities for more than twenty years.

The classical dances "Taruna" and "Barawangkia," performed by Ni Ketut Garsning, Ni Made Mani, and Ni Made Mani, famous female dancers from northern Bali, are adapted from stories such as the ancient Indian epic "Ramayana." These three famous amateur dancers and some other dancers were selected as members of this art troupe at the suggestion of Indonesian President Sukarno.

Gusti Laga, a famous female dancer from southern Bali who has visited the Americas and Europe, and Ni Made Tarmi, a famous female dancer from southern Bali who has visited Pakistan and Colombo, performed new Balinese dances with strong rhythms and rich expressions for the audience tonight.

The unique group dance "Kecak" and the peculiar "Gamelan" band also opened the eyes of the Chinese audience. The "Kecak" dance is a kind of custom ritual in ancient sacrifices, in which actors use rhythmic unison speech and singing to replace musical accompaniment. The "Gamelan" band is composed of "xylophones" connected with copper plates, "lyons," as well as gongs, cymbals, drums and other instruments. When playing, dozens of musicians strike the piano boards and gongs and cymbals with small hammers. Musicians call it "a grand ensemble of disassembled pianos."

In order to capture photos of the Balinese artists' graceful dance postures, a large group of photographers on and off the stage were extremely busy. Ye Qianyu and many other painters were busy with both eyes and hands, watching the dance while sketching the most exciting dance scenes on the spot.

Before the performance, a grand opening ceremony was held. Bao Erhan, President of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association, and Saléh Umar, Head of the art troupe, Third Vice President of the Indonesia-China Friendship Association, and Member of Parliament, spoke at the opening ceremony. They congratulated the further development of the friendship and cultural exchanges between the people of Indonesia and China.

After the performance, He Long, Chen Yi, Li Jishen, Wijopranoto and others went on stage to shake hands with the actors to express their gratitude. Students from the Beijing Dance School presented flowers to the Indonesian artists, and applause resounded throughout the stage and audience.

    印度尼西亚峇厘艺术友好访问团首次演出
    新华社23日讯　印度尼西亚峇厘的舞蹈家们，今天晚上在来中国以后的首次演出中，把观众带进了一个新的艺术境界。
    峇厘人民同中国人民虽然从一千多年以前就开始了交往，但是，绝大多数的中国观众还是第一次欣赏具有鲜明的民族风格的峇厘舞蹈。
    国务院副总理贺龙、陈毅，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李济深、文化部部长沈雁冰和许多艺术界著名人士都来观看演出。
    来观看演出的还有印度尼西亚驻中国大使维约普拉诺托和许多国家驻中国的外交使节。
    有一千五百多个席位的北京天桥剧场里今晚座无虚席，还有许多人站着看了两个半钟头。舞蹈家戴爱莲在评论峇厘舞的时候说：峇厘舞蹈艺术达到了很高的成就，我百看也不厌。
    舞台布景是按照峇厘的风景和传统习惯装置的，背景是浓绿的丛林、高耸的宝塔、红色的印度教的庙堂，演员穿着艳丽的服饰，随着“嘎木兰”打击乐队金鼓齐鸣、铿锵悦耳的齐奏，翩翩起舞。印度尼西亚舞蹈家今晚表演了九个节目。
    峇厘南部的最优秀女舞蹈家尼·鲁·楂宛和最优秀的男舞蹈家伊达·巴古斯·奥加等表演的古典舞“巴拉王”引起观众极大的兴趣。这个舞蹈描写了同牛郎织女巧会相似的神话故事。演员表演了峇厘舞蹈的特殊技艺——典雅繁细的手势、多变的眼睛、柔和的四肢动作。三十岁的尼·鲁·楂宛是峇厘的农民，她参加业余舞蹈活动已经有二十多年。
    峇厘北部著名女舞蹈家尼·格都·加斯宁，尼·玛德·玛尼和尼·玛德·玛尼表演的古典舞蹈“达鲁纳”和“巴拉哇基亚”，是根据印度古代史诗“罗摩耶那”等的故事改编的。这三位著名业余舞蹈家和其他一些舞蹈家都是在印度尼西亚苏加诺总统建议下被选为这个艺术团团员的。
    曾经访问过美洲、欧洲的峇厘南部著名女舞蹈家格斯特·拉加以及曾经访问过巴基斯坦和科伦坡的峇厘南部著名女舞蹈家尼·玛德·塔尔米今天晚上为观众表演了节奏强烈、表情丰富的新型峇厘舞蹈。
    别开生面的集体舞“格楂克”，以及奇特的“嘎木兰”乐队也都打开了中国观众的眼界。“格楂克”舞是古代祭祀时的一种风俗仪式，演员们用有节奏的齐语和歌唱来代替乐器伴奏。“嘎木兰”乐队是以用铜片连缀成的“板琴”、“来翁”以及锣、钗、鼓等乐器组成的。演奏时几十名乐师用小锤敲击琴板和锣、钗，音乐家称它作“拆散了的钢琴的大合奏”。
    为了摄取峇厘艺术家优美的舞姿的照片，台上台下一大群摄影记者忙的不可开交。叶浅予等许多画家眼手齐忙，他们一面看舞，一面把最精采的舞蹈场面即席画了下来。
    在演出以前，隆重地举行了开幕式。中国印度尼西亚友好协会会长鲍尔汉和艺术团团长、印度尼西亚—中国友好协会第三副主席、国会议员萨勒·乌玛尔先后在开幕式上讲话，他们祝贺印度尼西亚、中国两国人民的友谊和文化交流的进一步发展。
    在演出结束以后，贺龙，陈毅，李济深，维约普拉诺托等登上舞台同演员们握手致谢，北京舞蹈学校学生向印度尼西亚艺术家献了花，这时台上台下掌声连成一片。
