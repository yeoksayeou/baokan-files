    A Suggestion Saved Sixty-Five Tons of Steel
    (Our dispatch) The Tangshan Engineering Office of the Seventh Metallurgical and Chemical Construction Company of the Metallurgical Industry Bureau, in the expansion project of Qixin Cement Company it contracted this year, had a crane depot project, originally designed with an arched steel structure, requiring eighty-five tons of steel. In order to save steel for the country, Tian Huimin, a senior technician of the Engineering Office, carefully studied the building and believed that there was no high temperature inside and the vibration was not too great. It was entirely possible to change to a steel-wood hybrid structure. After obtaining the consent of Party A to modify the design, only twenty tons of steel were used to complete the construction of the crane depot, saving the country sixty-five tons of steel.

    一个建议省下了六十五吨钢材
    本报讯冶金工业部建筑局第七冶金化学建筑公司唐山工程处，在今年承包的启新水泥公司扩建任务中，有一项吊车库工程，原设计是采用拱型钢铁结构，需要钢材八十五吨。为了给国家节约钢材，工程处的老技师田惠民认真地研究了这个建筑物以后，认为它内部没有高温，震动也不太大。改为钢木混合结构是完全可以的，经取得甲方同意修改后，仅用了二十吨钢材就完成了吊车库的建筑，给国家节约了六十五吨钢材。（王廷义）
