Soviet Foreign Trade and Its Development Prospects
S. Borisov, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade of the Soviet Union

Due to the tremendous changes that have taken place in the Soviet national economy during the post-war period, the Soviet Union's import needs have also changed significantly. The characteristics of Soviet exports have also changed. The rapid growth of the Soviet economy in quantity and quality (industrial products in 1955 increased by 2.2 times compared with 1940) has made the variety of Soviet foreign trade much wider and more complex than before the war.

Soviet foreign trade has encountered new and important tasks: to assist the socialist construction of European and Asian People's Democratic countries, and to develop and consolidate the new world socialist market formed after the war, including thirteen countries in Europe and Asia. Foreign trade is the most important form of economic cooperation among socialist countries.

Promoting the development of political and economic relations between the Soviet Union and other countries, and ensuring peaceful coexistence with countries with different social systems, is also a very important task of foreign trade.

It must be noted that these tasks cannot be viewed in isolation; they are solved simultaneously and are closely related to each other.

After the Second World War, the volume of Soviet foreign trade increased significantly compared with before the war. The volume of foreign trade increased from 2.1 billion rubles in 1938 to 25 billion rubles in 1955. In 1955, the volume of Soviet foreign trade, calculated at comparable prices, or, as commonly said, its actual volume, increased by about 3.8 times compared with before the war.

Due to the rapid growth of Soviet foreign trade, the Soviet Union's position in international trade has also changed. In 1938, the Soviet Union ranked 16th in the world in terms of trade volume, but in 1955, it ranked 6th.

One of the main factors determining the rapid growth of Soviet foreign trade in the post-war years is the development of economic cooperation with socialist countries.

Before the war, the countries in Europe and Asia that are currently advancing along the socialist road accounted for a small proportion of Soviet foreign trade. The establishment of new People's Democratic social systems in many countries in Eastern Europe and Asia has opened up tremendous possibilities for developing international economic cooperation. Due to the rapid development of the national economies of the countries in the socialist camp, the demand for importing various commodities has increased, and at the same time, their export goods have also expanded. As a result, Soviet trade with the People's Democratic countries has greatly developed, increasing from 3 billion rubles in 1946 to 10.6 billion rubles in 1950, and reaching 19.6 billion rubles in 1955, that is, an increase of 5.5 times. In 1946, the People's Democratic countries accounted for 53% of Soviet foreign trade, and during the Fifth Five-Year Plan period, it reached 80%.

The Soviet Union supplies the People's Democratic countries with a large number of the latest industrial equipment, raw materials for heavy and light industries, and food. With the assistance of the Soviet Union, 446 enterprises and 96 separate workshops are being built in the socialist countries, including 211 in the People's Republic of China. The Soviet Union has provided long-term loans totaling 21 billion rubles to the socialist countries under the most favorable conditions. The Soviet Union's supplies are a great contribution to the socialist industrialization of these countries. When the enterprises built with Soviet assistance in these countries are put into production, the power generation capacity will increase by about 5.4 million kilowatts, metallurgical enterprises will increase by 9 million tons of steel and 65,000 tons of copper; chemical plants will increase annual production of more than 380,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer, about 500,000 tons of caustic soda and soda ash; and machinery manufacturing enterprises will increase production of 50,000 tractors and 140,000 cars.

The Soviet Union also obtains a large amount of equipment, raw materials, and consumer goods needed by the national economy from the People's Democratic countries.

Now the People's Republic of China ranks first in Soviet trade. In 1950, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and China was about 2 billion rubles. In recent years, it has reached almost 5 billion rubles each year, that is, almost the entire foreign trade volume of the Soviet Union in 1938 (calculated at comparable prices). The Soviet Union supplies China with equipment, ferrous metals, petroleum products, and many other commodities necessary for China's economic construction. The Soviet Union obtains agricultural products, ores, metals, and light industrial products from China. It is worth pointing out that the industrial products now supplied to the Soviet Union by the People's Republic of China account for about 40%.

Throughout the post-war period, Soviet trade ties with the socialist countries have developed smoothly.

The development of Soviet trade with Western European countries and the United States is another situation. At the end of the war, the Soviet Union took the necessary measures to restore and expand trade with these countries and signed trade agreements with the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and many other countries. The volume of Soviet trade with capitalist countries increased from 2.6 billion rubles in 1946 to 4.2 billion rubles in 1948. But later, the restrictions and discriminatory policies implemented by the United States and many Western European countries under American pressure increasingly affected Soviet trade with these countries. As a result, the volume of Soviet trade with capitalist countries decreased from 4.2 billion rubles in 1948 to 2.6 billion rubles in 1950, and remained quite low for several years.

In the following years, the interest of Western European countries in selling their goods to the Soviet Union and buying goods from the Soviet Union greatly increased, and thus Soviet trade with these countries expanded. At the same time, the volume of Soviet trade with Finland also increased from 1951 onwards based on long-term trade agreements. In recent years, Soviet economic ties with many countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East have also been rapidly expanding.

Before the Second World War, the main contractual parties in Soviet foreign trade were some major capitalist countries: the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States, and France. At that time, the volume of Soviet trade with Finland was not large, and the volume of trade with economically underdeveloped countries was also not large, and it was mainly conducted through the companies of the suzerain states.

Now the Soviet Union has expanded trade with its neighboring countries and economically underdeveloped countries. In the past five years, Soviet trade with India, Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, Egypt, and Argentina has more than doubled. The Soviet Union has begun to provide loans to certain countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, which creates additional preconditions for the great development of trade in the coming years.

As for the United States, the Soviet Union maintained a large amount of commodity exchange with it both before the war and in the early years after the war, but due to the discriminatory policies adopted by the American ruling group, the volume of trade with the United States has been reduced to insignificance.

For many years, the United Kingdom ranked first in the volume of Soviet foreign trade with capitalist countries, but in recent years, Finland has taken the first place.

The prospects for the development of Soviet foreign trade are determined by the main tasks of the Soviet Sixth Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy.

The program for expanding production in the Sixth Five-Year Plan not only plans to rapidly increase the level of domestic consumption in the Soviet Union, but also to greatly increase the possibility of Soviet exports. Due to the growth of the machinery manufacturing industry, the possibility of exporting equipment needed by socialist countries and most countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will be greatly increased. The export of many kinds of raw materials and materials will also increase.

While increasing the large amount of goods that the Soviet Union can allocate for export, it also strives to utilize the advantages of international division of labor to increase the import of many kinds of equipment, raw materials, and consumer goods.

Therefore, the growth of the national economy stipulated in the Sixth Five-Year Plan creates good preconditions for the further development of international economic ties in the Soviet Union.

The growth of the Soviet national economy is inextricably linked with the economic development of the entire socialist world system. As indicated by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the completion of the tasks in the Sixth Five-Year Plan will be a great contribution to the further consolidation of the entire socialist camp. The Soviet Union will vigorously expand cooperation with the People's Democratic countries in order to make the most rational use of economic resources in a way that benefits both each country and the entire socialist camp, and to utilize production capacity by developing cooperation in individual sectors of the national economy, by specializing in production cooperation, and by exchanging scientific and technological achievements and advanced production experience.

The tremendous growth of the national economies of the countries in the socialist camp, the development of heavy industry and dozens of new industrial sectors, and the mastery of mass production of thousands of new products, all require detailed division of labor, strengthening the specialization of production between countries, and concentrating the strength of many countries to solve individual national economic problems with the greatest economic effects in the shortest possible time.

The meeting of the Council for Economic Mutual Assistance of the countries in the socialist camp in May 1956 adopted recommendations agreed upon by the countries concerned regarding the main types of machinery and equipment, raw materials, fuels, and grains in terms of production levels and mutual supply. The decisions adopted at this meeting will be taken into account in their plans for developing the national economy and developing foreign trade.

The trade ties between the Soviet Union and the countries in the socialist camp will be further developed in the Sixth Five-Year Plan. Trade with the People's Republic of China is growing at a particularly fast pace.

At the same time, the Soviet Union will strive to expand mutually beneficial trade with all countries. The Soviet state leaders have taken many measures to achieve this goal. The Soviet Union has reached an agreement with Finland on signing long-term agreements for mutual supply of goods. Some measures have also been taken to expand trade with the United Kingdom, and trade with Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Iceland, and other countries is also expanding.

In recent years, the Soviet Union has achieved great success in creating the preconditions for further expanding trade with economically underdeveloped countries. The Soviet state leaders have stated more than once that the Soviet Union will increase its assistance to underdeveloped countries to develop their national economies and is willing to purchase their export goods. This is already being realized in practice. The Soviet Union provides economic or technical assistance like a friend, without imposing its own conditions on them. During the period of 1955-1956, the Soviet Union signed new important economic agreements with India, Burma, Afghanistan, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Pakistan, and Indonesia. Recently, government officials from Ceylon and Cambodia have expressed great interest in developing economic ties with the Soviet Union. Trade relations with Latin American countries are beginning to develop.

Therefore, in terms of foreign trade, the Sixth Five-Year Plan will further expand economic cooperation with the countries in the socialist camp, and develop and consolidate economic ties with all countries on the basis of adhering to the principle of mutual benefit and striving to develop trade.

    苏联对外贸易和它的发展前景
    苏联对外贸易部副部长　斯·波里索夫
    由于战后时期苏联国民经济中所发生的巨大变化，苏联在进口方面的需要也大大地改变了。苏联出口的特点也起了变化。苏联经济在数量上和质量上的迅速增长（1955年的工业产品比1940年增加了二点二倍），使苏联对外贸易的品种比战前广泛和复杂得多了。
    苏联对外贸易遇到了这样一些新的重要任务：援助欧洲和亚洲人民民主国家的社会主义建设，发展和巩固战后形成的包括欧亚两洲十三个国家的社会主义的新世界市场。对外贸易是社会主义各国之间经济合作的最重要的形式。
    促进苏联同其他国家政治和经济关系的发展，保证同社会制度不同国家的和平共处，也是对外贸易的一项很重要的任务。
    必须注意，不能把这些任务看做是孤立的，它们是同时解决并互相紧密联系着的。
    第二次世界大战以后苏联对外贸易额比战前大大地增加了。对外贸易额从1938年的二十一亿卢布增加到1955年的二百五十亿卢布。1955年苏联的对外贸易额，按比较价格计算，或是用通常的说法，它的实际量比战前约增加了三点八倍。
    由于苏联对外贸易的迅速增长，苏联在国际贸易中所占的地位也改变了。1938年苏联贸易额占世界第十六位，而在1955年已经占第六位了。
    决定战后年代苏联对外贸易额迅速增长的主要因素之一，是同社会主义各国经济合作的发展。
    战前欧洲和亚洲那些目前沿着社会主义道路前进的国家，在苏联对外贸易中所占的比重不大。东欧和亚洲许多国家中建立了新的人民民主的社会制度，这为发展国际经济合作开辟了巨大的可能性。社会主义阵营各国由于国民经济的迅速发展，对输入各种商品的要求日益增加，同时也扩大了它们的输出物资。结果，苏联同人民民主国家的贸易大大地发展了，按现行价格计算，从1946年的三十亿卢布增加到1950年的一百○六亿卢布，而1955年已达一百九十六亿卢布，即已增加了五点五倍。1946年人民民主国家在苏联对外贸易中所占的比重是53％，在第五个五年计划期间达到了80％。
    苏联以大量最新的工业设备、重工业和轻工业原料和粮食供应各人民民主国家。在各社会主义国家中正在苏联的帮助下建设四百四十六项企业和九十六个单独的车间，其中有二百一十一项在中华人民共和国。苏联在最优待的条件下对社会主义各国提供了总额为二百一十亿卢布的长期贷款。苏联的供应对这些国家的社会主义工业化是一个很大的贡献。当这些国家内由苏联帮助建设的企业投入生产以后，发电能力约将增加五百四十万瓩，冶金企业将增加九百万吨钢和六万五千吨铜；化学工厂每年将增产三十八万多吨的氮肥，约五十万吨的苛性苏打和焙烧苏打；机器制造企业将增产拖拉机五万台和汽车十四万辆。
    苏联也从人民民主国家那里获得国民经济中所需要的大量装备、原料和消费品。
    现在中华人民共和国在苏联的贸易中占第一位。1950年苏联同中国的贸易额约达二十亿卢布，在最近几年中每年差不多已达到五十亿卢布，也就是说，差不多达到1938年苏联的全部对外贸易额（按比较价格计算）。苏联供给中国以设备、黑色金属、石油产品和中国经济建设所必需的许多其他商品。苏联从中国得到农产品、矿砂、金属和轻工业制品。值得指出的是，现在中华人民共和国供售给苏联的工业产品已经约占40％了。
    在整个战后时期苏联同社会主义各国的贸易联系顺利地发展起来了。
    苏联同西欧各国和美国的贸易的发展，就是另外一种情况了。在战争结束的时候，苏联采取了必要的措施以恢复和扩大同这些国家的贸易，曾同英国、法国、比利时和其他许多国家签订了贸易协定。苏联同资本主义国家的贸易额从1946年的二十六亿卢布增加到1948年的四十二亿卢布。但是后来，美国以及在美国压迫下的许多西欧国家所实行的限制和歧视政策，越来越影响了苏联同这些国家的贸易。结果，苏联同资本主义国家的贸易额从1948年的四十二亿卢布减少到1950年的二十六亿卢布，并且在几年当中始终是相当低的。
    在以后的几年中，西欧国家对于向苏联销售自己的商品和从苏联购买商品的兴趣大大增加了，因而苏联同这些国家的贸易扩大起来了。同时，苏联从1951年起根据长期贸易协定同芬兰的贸易额也增加起来。最近几年来苏联同东南亚和中近东许多国家的经济联系也在迅速地扩大。
    在第二次世界大战以前苏联对外贸易的主要契约当事人是一些主要的资本主义国家：英国、德国、美国和法国。那时候苏联同芬兰的贸易量是不大的，同经济上不发达国家的贸易额也不大，而且主要是通过宗主国的公司进行。
    现在苏联扩大了同自己邻国和经济上不发达国家的贸易。在最近五年中苏联同印度、巴基斯坦、伊朗、阿富汗、埃及、阿根廷的贸易增加了一倍多。苏联开始给东南亚、中近东某些国家贷款，这为今后几年贸易的大发展创造了补充的前提条件。
    至于美国，苏联在战前和战后最初几年都同它保持着大量的商品交换，但是，由于美国统治集团采取了歧视政策，同美国的贸易量已缩减得微不足道了。
    英国在许多年间在苏联同资本主义国家的对外贸易额中都占第一位，而最近几年占第一位的已是芬兰了。
    苏联对外贸易发展的前景是由苏联发展国民经济第六个五年计划的主要任务来决定的。
    第六个五年计划扩大生产的纲领不仅预定要迅速提高苏联国内消费的水平，而且同时也要大大增加苏联输出的可能性。由于机器制造业的增长，将特别大大增加向社会主义国家以及亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲大多数国家输出它们所需要的设备的可能性。许多种原料和材料的输出也将增加。
    苏联一方面增加能够拨出的大量商品供输出用，同时竭力利用国际分工的优越性，来增加许多种设备、原料和消费品的输入。
    因此，第六个五年计划所规定的国民经济的增长，为苏联进一步发展国际经济联系创造了良好的前提。
    苏联国民经济的增长同整个社会主义世界体系经济的发展不可分割地联系着。正像苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的指示所指出的，完成第六个五年计划中的各项任务对于进一步巩固整个社会主义阵营将是一个巨大的贡献。苏联将大力扩展同人民民主各国的合作，以便最合理地、在既有利于每一个国家又有利于整个社会主义阵营的情况下来利用经济资源，并用发展国民经济个别部门的协作的方法，用生产合作的专业化的方法以及交换科学技术成就和先进生产经验的方法来利用生产能力。
    社会主义阵营各国国民经济的巨大增长，重工业和几十种新工业部门的发展，掌握几千种新制品的大量生产，这一切都要求细密的劳动分工，加强各国之间生产的专业化，集中许多国家的力量在最短期间内解决个别经济效果最大的国民经济问题。
    社会主义阵营各国经济互助委员会会议在1956年5月通过了各有关国家所商定的关于生产水平和互相供应的机器设备的主要类型、原料、燃料和粮食的推荐书。在它们发展国民经济的计划和发展对外贸易的计划中，将考虑到这次会议所通过的决议。
    第六个五年计划中苏联同社会主义阵营各国的贸易联系将获得进一步发展。同中华人民共和国的贸易正以特别快的速度增长着。
  同时，苏联将竭力扩大同所有国家的互相有利的贸易。苏联国家领导人已经采取了许多措施来实现这个目的。苏联已同芬兰达成了关于签订互相供售商品的长期协定的协议。还采取了一些措施来扩大同英国的贸易，同瑞典、挪威、丹麦、比利时、荷兰、冰岛和其他国家的贸易也正在扩大。
    近几年来苏联在创造进一步扩大同经济上不发达国家的贸易前提方面，获得了巨大的成就。苏联国家领导人不止一次地声明，苏联将增加对不发达国家的援助，以发展它们的民族经济，并乐意购买它们输出的商品。这一点实际上已经正在实现。苏联像朋友般地给以经济或技术援助，不把自己的条件强加给它们。在1955—1956年期间，苏联曾同印度、缅甸、阿富汗、埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、也门、巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚签订了新的重要的经济协定。最近期间锡兰和柬埔寨的政府人士对发展同苏联的经济联系表现了很大的兴趣。同拉丁美洲各国的贸易关系在开始发展。
    因此，在对外贸易方面，第六个五年计划将进一步扩大同社会主义阵营各国的经济合作，在遵守互利原则尽力发展贸易的基础上发展和巩固同所有国家的经济联系。　（本报特约稿）
