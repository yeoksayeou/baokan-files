Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 7th - Saigon News: Ngo Dinh Diem signed a decree on September 6th prohibiting foreigners residing in South Vietnam from engaging in certain industries and commodities. The decree stipulates that foreigners residing in South Vietnam must cease their business activities in these areas by the end of the year at the latest; those who violate this decree will be fined between 50,000 and 5,000,000 South Vietnamese Dong.

Agence France-Presse revealed that the main purpose of this decree is to crack down on many Indians, and especially to persecute overseas Chinese in South Vietnam. The majority of overseas Chinese are engaged in retail business. Ngo Dinh Diem has recently ordered the forced naturalization of overseas Chinese born in Vietnam.

This decree prohibits foreign residents from engaging in industries and commodities including food, clothing and accessories, coal and firewood, oils, used goods, textiles, rice and miscellaneous grains, as well as passenger and freight transportation by vehicles, motorboats, and sailboats.
