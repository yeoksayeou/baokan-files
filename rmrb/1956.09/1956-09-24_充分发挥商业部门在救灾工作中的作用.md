Give Full Play to the Role of Commercial Departments in Disaster Relief Work
Commentator of this newspaper

How to help the people in disaster areas overcome the disaster and the current difficulties in life? This is the central issue in the current work of disaster-stricken areas. State-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives bear arduous and heavy tasks in this work.

Under the unified deployment of party committees at all levels, state-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives in disaster areas have already done a lot of work and created many successful experiences suitable for the new situation. After Zhejiang Province was hit by a typhoon, the Zhejiang Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative successively purchased more than 22,000 dan and more than 20 train carriages of various vegetables and non-staple foods from within the province and from Shanghai, Beijing, Zhangjiakou, and other places to supply the people in disaster areas in a timely manner. After 18 counties including Hexian County and Tongcheng in Anhui Province received a large amount of building materials such as wood, moso bamboo, and reed mats supplied by the supply and marketing cooperatives, 30% of the collapsed houses have been repaired. According to different water conditions, the supply and marketing cooperatives in the waterlogged areas of Hebei Province used various methods such as carrying on their backs, shoulder carrying, animal carrying, and boat transportation to ensure a continuous supply of materials to the disaster areas. The supply and marketing cooperatives in 14 counties of Handan Prefecture organized 235 mobile trade teams, went deep into the disaster areas to supply materials and purchase local specialties, and were warmly welcomed by the people in the disaster areas, encouraging them to fight against the disaster with courage and confidence.

However, not all state-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives in disaster areas have paid attention to disaster relief work. A few commercial staff in some areas are still not concerned enough about the suffering of disaster victims. They lack initiative and creativity in their work and are at a loss in the face of inconvenient transportation, difficulties in transportation, or insufficient supply of goods. Therefore, some materials that should be supplied and can be supplied are not supplied in time, and local specialties and sideline products that should be purchased are not purchased in time. This deprives the people in disaster areas of the necessary material strength in their fight against the disaster. We must immediately overcome the erroneous attitude of indifference to the suffering of disaster victims, actively mobilize all forces, and do a good job in the supply and purchase of materials in disaster areas.

Correctly understanding the needs of the people in disaster areas is the prerequisite for doing a good job in the supply of materials to disaster areas. What are the urgent demands of the people in disaster areas in rebuilding their homes and restoring production?

Judging from the letters from the masses recently received by the editorial department, there is a general lack of cooking utensils such as iron pots, rice bowls, knives, and spoons in severely affected areas. In Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, a dozen or even dozens of families share one pot. There is also a shortage of firewood in some areas. Among the 226 households in the No. 2 Cooperative of Shihe Township, Shenqiu County, Henan Province, 180 households have burned all their broken furniture due to lack of firewood. The people in disaster areas also require a large supply of building materials such as lead wire, round nails, wood, and lime in order to repair the houses blown down, washed down, and damaged by wind and water as soon as possible. Winter is approaching, and the winter clothing problem of the disaster victims also needs to be solved as soon as possible. According to a survey in Anguo County, Hebei Province, the clothes of more than 15,000 people were either smashed in the mud and mildewed or washed away by water. Diseases are often prone to occur after water and drought disasters. Many patients with stomach problems, dysentery, and colds have been found in some disaster areas of Hebei Province, and they urgently need medicines. The above are the materials that the people in the disaster areas urgently need to supply in terms of life and the problems that need to be solved urgently.

In terms of production, disaster areas urgently need livestock feed, fertilizers, wheat seeds, small farm tools, and various sideline raw materials. If these problems are solved well, the people in the disaster areas can smoothly carry out production for self-relief and alleviate the spring famine next year; otherwise, the process of the people in the disaster areas fighting against the disaster will be prolonged.

At present, some of the commodities urgently needed by the people in the disaster areas are abundant in the national inventory and can be fully supplied, and they should be supplied in a timely manner; for commodities with small inventories, we must organize sources of goods in various ways to increase the supply; and there are also some commodities that cannot be fully supplied due to temporary production shortages, for example, Baoding Prefecture, Hebei Province needs a total of 100,000 iron pots, while the total inventory of large and small iron pots in the commercial departments of Hebei Province is only 100,000, which is not enough to supply Baoding Prefecture alone, let alone other areas. In order to take care of the special needs of the disaster areas, the superior business leadership organs must implement the principle of giving priority to supplying the disaster areas when allocating materials; when a certain commodity is in short supply, the supply to non-disaster areas should be reduced to meet the needs of the people in the disaster areas as much as possible. At the same time, we should also have leadership to organize the material adjustment work between non-disaster areas and disaster areas, and transport the materials that are surplus in non-disaster areas, temporarily idle, but urgently needed by the people in disaster areas to the disaster areas. As long as the people in non-disaster areas know the difficulties and needs of the people in disaster areas, they will carry forward the spirit of mutual assistance and give up the materials needed by the disaster victims to support the disaster victims in overcoming the disaster.

After the materials have been grasped and organized, the main problem becomes how to deliver them to the disaster victims as soon as possible, and improving the transportation situation. At present, there are two problems in transportation work: on the one hand, a large number of disaster relief materials urgently needed for transportation are piled up along the railway line, and on the other hand, transportation is very difficult due to floods and natural conditions, and some areas are inaccessible by vehicles and ships. Here, in addition to requiring the national railway and transportation departments to pay attention to this issue, actively mobilize all transportation forces, give full play to the transportation potential of railways, highways, and waterways, and transport disaster relief materials as soon as possible. Commercial departments should queue up the materials that need to be transported, and according to the needs of the disaster areas, distinguish between the importance and urgency, and first transport the most urgently needed materials to the places where they are most urgently needed. The local party and government leading organs and state-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives should also actively organize disaster victims to participate in transportation work. This can not only solve the difficulty of insufficient transportation capacity and ensure the supply of materials to the people in disaster areas, but also an effective measure for production and self-relief.

In the struggle to support the people in disaster areas to carry out production for self-relief, the responsibility of commercial institutions is not only to supply raw materials, but also to carry out purchasing business and actively help the masses to sell their products. In order to make the products produced by the disaster victims meet the needs of the market, commercial institutions should give specific guidance to the disaster victims to carry out various sideline and handicraft production in accordance with the needs of the country and the people, the market supply and demand, and the local characteristics and conditions. In the purchasing work, what is particularly important is to stipulate reasonable purchasing prices, which must enable the disaster victims to make profits when selling sideline products, so as to stimulate the development of sideline production in the disaster areas and effectively help the disaster victims to carry out production for self-relief. In order to encourage disaster victims to pay attention to improving the quality of products, the purchasing price should implement the policy of pricing according to quality and giving preferential prices to high-quality products. When the quality of products is improved, the sales of products will also be expanded, which prepares favorable conditions for reproduction.

The disaster situation in local areas is serious, and the time is urgent. However, in the people's own country, under the care of the party and the government and the people in non-disaster areas, especially under the favorable conditions that the rural areas of the country have basically realized cooperation, we will surely be able to smoothly overcome the disaster and overcome the difficulties. It is hoped that state-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives, especially commercial institutions in disaster areas, will play their unique and huge role in the arduous struggle to support disaster victims in overcoming disasters.

    充分发挥商业部门在救灾工作中的作用
    本报评论员
    怎样帮助灾区群众战胜灾荒、克服当前生活中的困难？这是受灾地区当前工作中的中心问题。国家商业和供销合作部门，在这个工作中，担负着艰巨而繁重的任务。
    在各级党委统一部署下，灾区的国营商业和供销合作部门，已经作了很多工作，创造了不少适合新情况的成功经验。浙江省供销社在该省遭受台风袭击以后，已经先后从省内和上海、北京、张家口等地采购了二万二千多担又二十多个车皮的各种蔬菜和副食品，及时供应灾区人民食用。安徽省和县、桐城等十八个县，得到供销社供应的大量木材、毛竹、芦席等建筑材料以后，倒塌的房屋中已经有30％修复了。河北省水涝地区的供销社，根据不同的水情，运用人背、肩挑、牲口驮和船运等各种方法，保证了灾区物资不断供应。邯郸专区十四个县的供销社组织了二百三十五个流动贸易小组，深入灾区进行物资供应和土特产的收购工作，受到灾区人民的热烈欢迎，并鼓舞了灾区人民向灾害作斗争的勇气和信心。
    但是，并不是所有灾区的国营商业和供销合作部门都重视了救灾工作。有少数地区的商业工作人员对灾民的疾苦还不够关心，他们在工作中缺乏主动精神和创造性，在交通不便、运输困难，或者是货源不足的情况面前束手无策。因此，有些应该供应并且能够供应的物资没有及时供应，应该收购的土特产品和副业产品没有及时收购。这就使灾区人民在同灾荒斗争中缺少了必要的物质力量。必须立即克服对灾民疾苦漠不关心的错误态度，积极调动一切力量，做好灾区的物资供应和收购工作。
    正确地了解灾区人民的需要，是作好灾区物资供应工作的前提。目前灾区人民在重建家园和恢复生产中，究竟有哪些迫切的要求呢？
    从编辑部最近收到的群众来信看，重灾地区普遍缺乏铁锅、饭碗、刀、勺等烧饭用具，河北邯郸专区有十几家、甚至几十家共用一口锅的。也有些地区缺柴。河南沈丘县石河乡二社二百二十六户中，有一百八十户因为缺柴烧，把破家具都烧光了。灾区人民还要求供应大量铅丝、元钉、木材、石灰等建筑材料，以便及早修建被风吹、水冲倒塌和损坏了的房屋。寒冬快到了，灾民们的冬衣问题也需要及早解决。据河北安国县调查，有一万五千多人的衣服被砸在泥内霉坏了或是被水冲走了。水、旱灾害之后，常常容易发生疾病，河北省有些灾区已经发现不少闹胃病、痢疾、感冒的病人，他们迫切需要药品。以上是当前灾区人民在生活方面急需供应的物资和急需解决的问题。
    在生产方面，灾区急需牲畜饲草、肥料、麦种和小型农具，以及各种副业原料。这些问题解决的好，灾区人民就可以顺利地开展生产自救并减轻明年的春荒；否则就会延长灾区人民和灾害作斗争的过程。
    目前灾区人民迫切需要的商品，有的是国家库存丰富，可以充分供应的，要及时供应；库存不多的商品，要多方组织货源，增加供应；也有的商品由于生产暂时赶不上需要，不可能充分供应，例如河北省保定专区共需要铁锅十万口，而河北省商业部门库存大、小铁锅总共不过十万口，只供应保定专区尚嫌不足，何况还要供应其他地区呢。为了照顾灾区的特殊需要，上级业务领导机关在分配物资的时候，必须贯彻优先供应灾区的原则；当某种商品供不应求的时候，应该缩减对非灾区的供应数量，尽量满足灾区人民的需要。同时，还应该有领导地组织非灾区和灾区的物资调剂工作，把非灾区多余的，暂时闲置不用的，而灾区人民迫切需要的物资，运送到灾区去。非灾区人民只要知道了灾区人民的困难和需要，他们就会发扬互助精神，把灾民需要的物资让出来，支持灾民战胜灾害。
    已经掌握和组织到物资以后，要尽快地送到灾民手里，改善运输工作状况就成为主要的问题了。目前运输工作存在着两方面的问题：一方面是，铁路沿线积压了大量急待运输的救灾物资，另方面是，因为水灾和自然条件的限制，有些地区车船不通，运输十分困难。这里，除了要求国家铁道和交通部门应该重视这个问题，积极调动一切运输力量，充分发挥铁路、公路和水路的运输潜力，尽速把救灾物资运送出去。商业部门应该把需要运送的物资排排队，根据灾区需要情况，分别轻重缓急，把最急需的物资首先运送到最迫切需要的地方去。各地党政领导机关和国营商业、供销合作部门，还应该积极组织灾民参加运输工作。这不但可以解决运输力不足的困难，保证灾区人民的物资供应，也是生产自救的一项有效措施。
    在扶持灾区人民生产自救的斗争中，商业机构的责任不仅仅是供应原料，同时还要开展收购业务，积极帮助群众推销产品。为了使灾民生产的产品适合市场的需要，商业机构应该按照国家和人民的需要、市场供求情况、当地的特点和条件等，具体指导灾民开展各种副业和手工业生产。在收购工作中，特别重要的是，规定合理的收购价格，必须使灾民出售副业产品时有利可得，这才能刺激灾区副业生产的发展，也才能有效地帮助灾民生产自救。为了鼓励灾民注意提高产品的质量，收购价格应该贯彻按质论价、优级优价的政策，产品的质量提高了，产品的销路也就扩大了，这就为再生产准备了有利的条件。
    局部地区的灾情是严重的，时间是紧迫的。但是，在人民自己的国家里，在党和政府和非灾区人民的关怀下，特别是在全国农村已经基本上实现合作化的有利条件下，一定能顺利地度过灾荒、战胜困难。希望国营商业和供销合作部门，特别是灾区的商业机构，在支持灾民战胜灾害的艰巨斗争中，发挥它特有的巨大作用。
