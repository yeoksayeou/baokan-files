    Making Foreign Designs More Perfect
    ——On Designer Pi Zhenmin's Rational Suggestions
    Chen Mu
    Pi Zhenmin, an engineer at the Fourth Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways Design General Bureau, independently thought, carefully studied, and modified a foreign design based on China's specific conditions while assisting in railway surveying work in the Daye Iron Mine area. This made the foreign design more reasonable, saving the country more than 400,000 yuan in investment and deferring 160,000 yuan in investment.
    Pi Zhenmin is a line engineer at the Fourth Design Institute and has always been positive and meticulous in his work. However, he used to lack confidence and was afraid to take independent responsibility. At the beginning of this year, Pi Zhenmin served as the acting overall engineer in the double-tracking project of the Jinghan Railway's Shi (Jiazhuang) - Yang (Quan) section. Once, when reviewing the construction organization documents for a certain tunnel, he found that there was a great waste in transportation. At first, he put forward his opinions, but later, after hearing that this issue had been reported to Soviet experts and had been agreed upon, he dared not insist on his own opinion. Later, others encouraged him to consult Soviet experts, and the experts immediately abandoned their opinions upon hearing their report and encouraged their spirit of not being restricted by documents and giving full play to their own ideas.
    At the end of April this year, the Fourth Design Institute sent Pi Zhenmin to Daye Iron Mine to assist in the surveying work of the mining area. The mining area railway of this iron mine was also designed by the Soviet Union. However, because the complete foreign design had not yet arrived, the leaders of the iron mine, in order to avoid idling, entrusted Pi Zhenmin to prepare a construction organization plan based on the foreign design that had already arrived, so that construction could begin. In the process of preparing this construction organization plan, Pi Zhenmin discovered that some aspects of the foreign design contained loopholes because China's information was incomplete or due to differences in habits between China and the Soviet Union. For example, the aperture of culverts and drainage ditches on the railway. Although the foreign design had increased the size five times based on the rainfall in the Wuhan area due to incomplete information provided by China, it was still considered small, which would cause rainwater to accumulate and erode the roadbed in the future. Furthermore, regarding the location of a certain line on the railway, the foreign design was positioned too high because it did not fully understand the geological conditions of the site, resulting in more than 100,000 cubic meters of excavation work, including 80,000 cubic meters of very hard marble and diorite. Another example is the location of a highway. The foreign design turned left from the starting point to the end point, which would pass through a high ground and require more than 30,000 cubic meters of excavation work. After detailed study of the foreign design, Pi Zhenmin believed that the reason why the foreign design adopted this plan, instead of avoiding this high ground and going to the right, was to avoid demolishing a large area of residential buildings in the middle of the road on the right. However, now that this village has been relocated, this design should be changed to avoid wasting manpower and material resources on this 30,000+ cubic meter project.
    Pi Zhenmin believed that although these problems accounted for a small proportion of the overall design, they affected the quality of the project and caused waste of state property. Therefore, he put forward his opinions on modifying these designs and made some suggestions for improvement, which were supported by the administrative and Party leadership of Daye Iron Mine.
    Now, according to Pi Zhenmin's opinions, Daye Iron Mine has modified certain parts of the foreign design. After these modifications, the foreign design is more in line with China's actual situation and is more perfect. Moreover, after the modifications, the country has saved more than 400,000 yuan in investment, and another 160,000 yuan in investment can be temporarily deferred.

    使国外设计更加完善
    ——记设计师皮振民的合理建议
    陈牧
    铁道部设计总局第四设计院工程师皮振民，在协助大冶铁矿矿区作铁路测量工作中，独立思考，细心钻研，根据我国具体情况修改了国外设计，使国外设计更加合理，为国家节省投资四十万多元，延期投资十六万元。
    皮振民是第四设计院的线路工程师，工作一贯积极细致。只是胆子较小，不敢独立负责。今年年初，皮振民在京汉路石（家庄）阳（泉）段复线工程中担任代理总体工程师的职务。有一次审查某个山洞的施工组织文件时，发现在运输上有很大的浪费。开始他还将自己的意见提了出来，后来听说这个问题已经向苏联专家汇报过并取得了同意，就不敢再坚持自己的意见，以后，别人鼓励他去请教苏联专家，专家一听他们的汇报立刻放弃了自己的意见，并且鼓励他们这种不受文件限制发挥自己见解的精神。
    今年4月底，第四设计院派皮振民到大冶铁矿去协助矿区的测量工作。这个铁矿的矿区铁路也是苏联设计的。但是因为国外设计没有全部到达，铁矿领导上为了避免窝工，就委托皮振民根据已经来到的国外设计编制一个施工组织方案先行施工。在编制这个施工组织方案中，皮振民发现国外设计中有些地方因为我国资料提供得不完整或中苏两国习惯不同，存在着一些漏洞。例如铁路上涵洞和排水沟的孔径，因为我国的资料提供得不完全，国外设计虽然根据武汉地区的雨量，在这个资料的基础上加大了五倍，但是仍嫌小，将来就有使雨水淤积，浸蚀路基的危险。又例如铁路上某号线的位置，国外设计时因为不完全了解现场的地质情况，定位偏高，结果要多做十万多立方公尺挖土工程，其中并有八万立方公尺是很坚硬难做的大理石和闪长岩工程。又如有一条公路线的位置，国外设计从起点到终点是向左转，这样就要经过一个高地，多做三万多立方公尺挖土工程，皮振民详细研究了国外设计后，认为国外设计所以采用这个方案，而不避开这个高地走右边，是为了避免拆除右边路中的一大片民房。但是现在这个村庄已经拆迁了，就应该改变这个设计，免得浪费这三万多立方公尺工程的人力和物力。
    皮振民认为这些问题在整个设计中所占的比重虽然很小，但是影响到工程的质量，并且造成国家财产的浪费，就提出了修改这些设计的意见，并提出了一些改进的建议，得到了大冶铁矿行政和党的领导上的支持。
    现在，大冶铁矿根据皮振民的意见，对国外设计的某些部分进行了修改，经过这些修改以后，国外设计比前更加切合我国的实际情况，更臻完善；而且经过修改，还给国家节省投资四十万多元，另有十六万元投资可以暂缓。
