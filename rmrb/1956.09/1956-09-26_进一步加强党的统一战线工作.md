Comrade Li Weihan, Head of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, spoke:

I fully endorse Chairman Mao's opening address and the reports made by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhou Enlai on behalf of the Central Committee.

In the eleven years from the Seventh National Congress of the Party to the Eighth National Congress, thanks to the leadership of the Central Committee's correct line, all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties and non-party democratic人士, and people's organizations in our country united within the people's democratic united front, achieving a complete victory in the new democratic revolution and a decisive victory in the socialist revolution.

China's historical and social conditions determine the necessity, breadth, and long-term development of the revolutionary united front. The people's democratic united front, formed and developed in the long revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, is a broad alliance based on the worker-peasant alliance and including all non-laboring people who can cooperate. Without the worker-peasant alliance, there can be no people's democratic united front, no revolutionary victory, and the Party must always do its best to expand and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. At the same time, the alliance with non-laboring people who can cooperate can also help the worker-peasant alliance to strengthen the revolutionary forces, isolate the counter-revolutionary forces, and educate allies, which is an indispensable part of the united front. Therefore, the Party must always unite all forces that can be united. This latter alliance has included all classes, strata, and groups that could cooperate for a long time and those that could only cooperate temporarily in different historical conditions, but among these non-laboring people allies, there is a class that has long occupied an important position, and this is the national bourgeoisie.

United Front Work Towards the National Bourgeoisie

The national bourgeoisie, including their intellectuals, has had a great influence on society, both in the past and now. At the same time, they have a dual character with respect to both the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. They are basically opposed to imperialism. Because of this, they are not only the allies of the Chinese working class in the stage of democratic revolution, but also the allies of the world proletariat from the perspective of the international revolutionary front. Even in the stage of socialist revolution in our country, they still maintain an anti-imperialist and patriotic stand, and have played a positive role in restoring the national economy and developing industrial construction, as well as in developing modern culture and technology. However, "the socio-economic status of the national bourgeoisie determines their weakness, their lack of foresight, their lack of sufficient courage, and many of them are afraid of the masses" ("On the People's Democratic Dictatorship"). Therefore, they took a tortuous path of participating, echoing the counter-revolution, remaining neutral, and finally participating in the New Democratic Revolution. Moreover, their subjective desire to participate in the New Democratic Revolution was to strive for China's capitalist future. Therefore, after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the struggle of "who will win" between capitalism and socialism gradually began between them and the working class. Because of this influence and duality of the national bourgeoisie, the relationship between the working class and the national bourgeoisie is not only related to whether the working class can win over the middle forces and isolate the reactionary forces, but also affects the struggle of the working class to realize its leadership over the peasants and the urban petty bourgeoisie, and also affects the struggle for the two futures of the country. Therefore, the relationship with the national bourgeoisie has always been an important issue in our Party's general line.

Adopting a Policy of Active Struggle and Unity, and Seeking Unity Through Struggle

Before the Zunyi Conference of the Party in 1935, the leadership of the Party in certain periods had committed right-leaning opportunist errors of "all alliance, denying struggle" on this important issue, and had also committed left-leaning opportunist errors of "all struggle, denying alliance." After the Zunyi Conference, the Party Central Committee, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, corrected these errors and, based on the duality of the national bourgeoisie, adopted a policy of active struggle and unity, and seeking unity through struggle. Therefore, the national bourgeoisie was won over to participate in the Anti-Japanese National United Front, and they were able to maintain a general neutrality between the Kuomintang die-hards and the Communist Party, with some people sympathizing with us. This was conducive to our Party developing progressive forces, winning over other middle forces, isolating die-hard forces, and overcoming the danger of splits and surrenders by the die-hards in the environment at that time. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, that is, after the Seventh National Congress of the Party, our Party, according to the new political situation, united with the national bourgeoisie to carry out the struggle against civil war and dictatorship and for peace and democracy; and in this struggle, we patiently persuaded and criticized the tendency of unprincipled concessions to them. During the People's Liberation War, we continued to maintain an alliance with the national bourgeoisie in the struggle against dictatorship and civil war; however, we had to carry out a serious struggle against the "middle road," that is, the "third road," that occurred among them, because this was a reactionary line that did not approve of thorough land reform, did not approve of overthrowing the entire Kuomintang rule, and harbored great illusions about the "encouragement of democratic individualism" by American imperialism. Our Party helped them to be educated from the victorious development of the People's Liberation War and the broad movement of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas against civil war, dictatorship, hunger, and against American imperialism, and finally abandoned the "middle road." This struggle to overcome the "middle road" was a struggle to win the thoroughness of the people's revolution and the leadership of the working class over the country, and ultimately a struggle to win the socialist future of the country. This was also a turning point in the historical destiny of the national bourgeoisie, and from then on they began to accept the leadership of the working class in practice. In this way, and due to the education of the "Five-Anti" (anti-bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence) movement, which further enabled them to accept the leadership of the working class, it became entirely possible for us to gradually make them give up the capitalist road, give up illusions such as the long-term coexistence and peaceful coexistence of socialist and capitalist economic components, and accept the socialist road through peaceful transformation on the basis of the increasing consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship and the increasing development of the socialist economy.

Five Points of Experience in Winning Over and Transforming the National Bourgeoisie

The history of both revolutions proves that the united front is a weapon and special form of class struggle. "The united front policy is the class policy, and the two are inseparable." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, p. 763) All opportunists are unable to understand this point and oppose class struggle to the united front—right-leaning opportunists believe that to maintain the united front, they have to give up class struggle and the independence of the proletariat; left-leaning opportunists call all struggle and denial of the united front class policy. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, our Party has adhered to the policy of active struggle and unity, and seeking unity through struggle, thereby correctly handling the relationship between class struggle and the united front, and successfully winning over and basically transforming the national bourgeoisie. In the experience of implementing this policy towards the national bourgeoisie, the main points are as follows: (1) The Chinese national bourgeoisie is a class with great vacillation and weakness. The working class must, on the one hand, unremittingly expand and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and strengthen the revolutionary forces, and on the other hand, carry out resolute and intelligent struggles against imperialism and domestic reactionary forces in order to gradually win over the national bourgeoisie. (2) Taking care of the reasonable interests of allies is a necessary condition for winning over allies. As early as the Anti-Japanese War period, our Party absorbed political representatives of the national bourgeoisie to participate in the democratic power of the base areas, and implemented the economic policy of "both public and private interests, and both labor and capital interests"; this policy continued to a period after the founding of the People's Republic of China. As everyone knows, in the socialist transformation movement, our government continued to take care of the reasonable interests of the national bourgeoisie and guaranteed that they would have a way out in work and life and a bright future after the elimination of classes. (3) Conducting long-term and repeated persuasion and education to them. The most important thing is practical education, that is, guiding them to accept education from practical political experience; at the same time, combining practical education with patient reasoning, and combining encouragement with criticism. (4) Developing progressive forces among them, winning over middle elements to turn to the left, educating and waiting for backward elements more, and isolating and disintegrating a few stubborn elements. Pay attention to cultivating progressive core forces so that they can play a leading role, backbone role, and bridge role. (5) Distinguish the intellectuals of the national bourgeoisie from the national capitalists. Because bourgeois intellectuals generally do not own the means of production, they are the backbone of mastering modern science and culture, and they are more patriotic and have a political sense, and have a significant impact on national capitalists. Therefore, we had long conducted work to win over and educate them before the victory of the revolution. After the victory of the revolution, the majority of bourgeois intellectuals quickly turned to honestly serving the People's Republic, and their political stance gradually turned to the stance of the working class with the progress of ideological transformation, which was not accidental. Their attitude and actions played an important role in promoting the acceptance of socialist transformation by national capitalists.

Democratic Parties and Non-Party Democratic Figures Played an Important Role

The democratic parties and non-party democratic figures have given great help to our efforts to win over the national bourgeoisie, the upper petty bourgeoisie, and their intellectuals. Because the national bourgeoisie, the upper petty bourgeoisie, and their intellectuals have been the social foundation of the democratic parties in the past and present, our establishment of a relationship of both unity and struggle with these classes and strata was mainly through the democratic parties and non-party democratic figures before the founding of the People's Republic of China. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, we directly established multifaceted connections with these classes and strata. However, in the work of uniting, educating, and transforming these classes and strata, the democratic parties and non-party democratic figures still played an important role and will continue to play an important role. In the future, after these classes and strata are transformed into working people, the democratic parties and non-party democratic figures will continue to work among this part of the working people, will continue to contact and represent a part of the working people they can contact and represent, and will coexist with our Party for a long time and supervise each other.

United Front Work Towards Upper-Class Figures of Ethnic Minorities

Below, I will talk a little about the united front work towards upper-class figures of ethnic minorities, patriotic figures in religious circles, and overseas Chinese.

Each ethnic minority has some upper-class figures, who are pre-capitalist or capitalist exploiters and the intellectuals of these exploiting classes. The contradictions between them and the working people can only be resolved through social reform (including democratic reform and socialist transformation). On the other hand, the majority of these upper-class figures have a patriotic stance and have certain connections with the working people in terms of ethnic relations, and some in terms of religious relations, becoming public leaders of their own ethnic groups. In some ethnic minorities, these public leaders have a great influence. Our Party has long made a correct estimate of the situation of these two aspects of the public leaders of ethnic minorities, and has adopted a policy of winning over and uniting with them. Therefore, before the victory of the revolution, we had already established a united front against imperialism and against the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang with many public leaders of ethnic minorities. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, this aspect of the united front has been further expanded and consolidated. With the help of this aspect of the united front, we peacefully liberated Tibet, we established contact with many ethnic minority people who had no contact or little contact in the past, and carried out work, which played an auxiliary role in the alliance of working people. In terms of ethnic unity, many public leaders of ethnic minorities have done useful work in social reform; at the same time, they themselves have also received political education and made progress to varying degrees. Under the conditions in our country, the socialist transformation of all ethnic groups is carried out by peaceful methods. In some ethnic minority areas that need to implement democratic reform, because the social development situation there is special, it is also necessary to adopt peaceful methods to carry it out. It is precisely because of the existence and development of the united front between the working people and public leaders that peaceful reform has become necessary and possible. Peaceful reform is a special form of class struggle, that is, relying on the working people, uniting all forces that can be united, and adopting gradual, roundabout methods to achieve the goals of democratic revolution and social revolution. Instead of forcing the exploiters to give up exploitation through strong struggle, we persuade them to voluntarily give up exploitation through peaceful consultation; at the same time, the state adopts appropriate measures to ensure that their political status and living standards are not lowered. Regarding the specific policies, methods, steps, deployment, and time of social reform, the representatives of the working people and public leaders will conduct serious consultation, and only when both parties truly agree will the reform be carried out, otherwise it is better to slow down and wait for it to be fully prepared before proceeding. Here, persuading the working people to make certain necessary and reasonable concessions has positive significance. In some places, there is a lack of sufficient estimation of the influence of public leaders of ethnic minorities and insufficient consultation with them, which should be corrected. At the same time, we must also patiently help public leaders and other upper-class figures conduct self-education, and help them to actively approach the working people in order to gain the understanding of the working people and achieve long-term cooperation. Peaceful reform can promote ethnic unity; it can reduce or even avoid the destruction of productive forces and social wealth (the level of productive forces in many ethnic minority areas is very low, and social wealth is very scarce, so it should be avoided as much as possible); it can win over a group of intellectuals to serve socialism (there are very few intellectuals in ethnic minorities, so they should be won over and educated as much as possible). Therefore, we should seriously implement the policy of peaceful reform in ethnic minority areas.

United Front Work Towards Patriotic Figures in Religious Circles

Our country has religions such as Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, and Christianity (including both old and new schools). Religious issues occupy a fairly important position in the social issues of our country. Buddhism, Taoism, and Islam have a long history in our country, and Buddhism and Islam have a widespread and deep influence in some ethnic minorities; religions other than Taoism have international connections. In the era of old China, imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries tried in every way to control religious circles, trying to turn religion into their tools. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, our Party and government, through various means, conducted anti-imperialist and patriotic education in religious circles, helping them to get rid of the influence of imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries, and exposing and eliminating counter-revolutionaries, thereby ensuring the patriotic freedom of religious circles and uniting them within the people's democratic united front. At the same time, our Party and government implemented a thorough policy of freedom of religious belief. That is: it is free to believe in religion or not to believe in religion; it is free to believe in that religion and that denomination; it is free to believe in religion now and not to believe in religion in the future, or not to believe in religion now and to believe in religion in the future. This has improved the unity between religious and non-religious circles and within religious circles. In our country, as long as people believe in religion, we respect their freedom of belief and protect the religion they believe in. The Communist Party is a materialist, so it does not believe in religion; at the same time, the Communist Party is a historical materialist and understands the reasons why religion will inevitably exist for a long time, so it has adopted a policy of long-term respect for freedom of religious belief. There are still cases of using administrative means in handling religious issues, which must be corrected.

United Front Work Towards Overseas Chinese

Among overseas Chinese, a patriotic united front has also been widely formed and developed. Overseas Chinese have always had a patriotic tradition, and the independence of the motherland and the achievements of the past few years have further encouraged them to carry forward this tradition. The policies and measures taken by our country in the overseas Chinese aspect have further promoted the unity and mutual assistance of overseas Chinese and promoted the improvement of their relations with the governments and people of the countries where they reside. These policies and measures are: (1) Resolutely protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese; allow overseas Chinese to choose their nationality according to the principle of voluntariness; and persuade them to maintain friendly relations with the people of the countries where they reside, abide by the laws of the countries where they reside, and not interfere in the internal affairs of the countries where they reside. (2) Call on overseas Chinese to unite widely, regardless of their origin, occupation, class, and belief, on the basis of loving the motherland and protecting their legitimate rights and interests, and help various overseas Chinese organizations, schools, newspapers, and overseas Chinese leaders in various aspects to eliminate gaps and implement cooperation on the above basis. (3) Protect overseas Chinese remittances and give preferential treatment to overseas Chinese investment; welcome overseas Chinese to return to the country to participate in construction or participate in learning, and provide convenience. (4) Take care of the special circumstances and needs of domestic relatives of overseas Chinese, and gradually guide them to participate in the socialist construction of the country together with the people of the whole country. These policies and measures have been approved and supported by the broad masses of overseas Chinese, and we must continue to implement them and overcome some shortcomings in the overseas Chinese area and other aspects of work.

Future tasks

In the future, the task of the people's democratic united front is to continue to unite all forces that can be united, mobilize all positive factors that can be mobilized, and strive together to complete socialist transformation and build China into a great socialist country. The decisive victory of the socialist revolution has created favorable conditions, enabling us to fully mobilize positive factors that could not be mobilized under past conditions or that have not been fully exploited due to the shortcomings of our work, and it is also possible to turn a part of the negative factors into positive factors to serve socialism. For this purpose, we should carry forward the democratic traditions in the united front on the basis of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, mainly the traditions of political consultation, working together, mutual supervision, and self-education.

Carry forward the tradition of political consultation

Political consultation is an important method for our country to realize people's democracy. The internal relations of the people's democratic united front in our country are adjusted through consultation, important issues in national affairs are decided after mature consultation, and national elections are also nominated through consultation. It is precisely because opinions have been repeatedly exchanged and debates have been carried out in the consultation process, thereby clarifying right and wrong and reaching agreements, that when conducting elections and passing bills, the greatest majority of consensus or even unanimous approval and resolution naturally and often appear. Political consultation does not obliterate class contradictions or make unprincipled reconciliation of class contradictions; the benefit of political consultation is that it can both realize the democratic rights of the vast majority of the people and respect the democratic rights of the people in the minority position, and after full consultation, make the political views of all parties basically reach appropriate concentration and unity. The so-called people in the minority position here are a part of the people that the democratic parties, non-party democratic figures, and other patriotic figures are in contact with and represent. Respecting the democratic rights of this part of the people is a necessary condition for the consolidation and expansion of the people's democratic united front. Our Party Central Committee and state leading organs have always paid attention to giving play to the role of political consultation, especially when taking major measures, and if they have not conducted full consultation with relevant non-Party figures, they would rather make decisions a little slower. All issues that should be widely consulted are brought to the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for consultation, and some are also brought to the committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions for consultation. The National Committee and local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are political consultation organs and united front organizations, and play an important role in the united front and national political life. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao attach great importance to the work of the CPPCC, and we should strive to make its activities more substantial and active.

Correctly handle the relationship of working together with non-Party personnel

In recent years, our Party's relationship of working together with non-Party personnel in state organs, schools, and enterprises has become increasingly widespread, especially after fundamental changes have taken place in capitalist relations of production, this relationship of working together has reached a scale that includes the vast majority of capital personnel. Correctly handling this relationship has very important significance in national political life. A major problem that exists relatively universally here is how to ensure that non-Party personnel have authority with responsibility. We believe that the key to solving this problem lies in earnestly implementing the system of combining collective leadership with the Communist Party as the core and division of labor and responsibility with non-Party personnel. It is entirely necessary for the Party groups or Party committees of organs, schools, enterprises, and armed forces to discuss important issues in work and business and put forward suggestions; but they must also conduct full consultation with relevant non-Party personnel in appropriate ways, and then submit them to administrative meetings for serious discussion and make decisions. In this way, it can both realize the core leadership role of the Communist Party and implement collective leadership with non-Party personnel in administration. Some people oppose the core leadership role of the Communist Party to administrative power, which is incorrect. The responsibilities shared by non-Party personnel should be earnestly respected so that they can handle the issues that should be handled by them, participate in or preside over the meetings that should be participated in or presided over by them, and read the documents that should be read by them. In work, they should be given full support and assistance so that they can give play to their strengths, make achievements, and make progress in the common cause. In addition, some inappropriate situations in the arrangement and use of certain non-Party personnel should be corrected.

Create necessary conditions to facilitate non-Party figures to supervise us

Fully carrying forward the democratic traditions of political consultation and working together is also conducive to mutual supervision. As far as our Party is concerned, Chairman Mao pointed out long ago: "We are not afraid to speak out about our own shortcomings, and we must correct our own shortcomings. We must strengthen internal Party education to eliminate these shortcomings, and we must also eliminate these shortcomings through democratic cooperation with non-Party figures. Such internal and external attacks can cure our shortcomings and truly handle national affairs well." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, p. 832) Now that our Party occupies a core leadership position among the people of the whole country, it is even more necessary to have such internal and external attacks. We need supervision from the broad masses of working people, which is the basic reliance. At the same time, we also need supervision from the democratic parties and non-party democratic figures, because they represent the opinions and demands of one aspect of society, and have certain political experience and professional expertise, and can often put forward pertinent criticisms and opinions to us. Even if some criticisms and opinions are not pertinent or incorrect, they also help us to seriously analyze and handle problems and maintain a clear head. We must create all necessary conditions to facilitate the democratic parties and non-party democratic figures to supervise us. Organizing regular and irregular inspections; fully展开 criticism and self-criticism at the meetings of the People's Congress, the People's Political Consultative Conference, and other state organs; and conducting forums and consultations between the Party organizations in various organs and the democratic party organizations and democratic figures, and between the relevant organs and the relevant democratic parties, democratic figures, and people's organizations; these are all effective methods that have already been implemented and should be done more widely and more seriously, and should be formed into a system.

Use self-education and self-transformation methods

Self-education and self-transformation will continue to be an important task of the people's democratic united front in the future. First of all, national capitalists and their agents still need several years to complete the transformation from exploiters to laborers; some bourgeois intellectuals still need to continue to work hard to completely shift their political positions to the position of the working class; and the self-transformation of some upper-class figures of ethnic minorities and other patriotic elements may take more time. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of both unity and struggle, both encouragement and criticism, to promote the class and strata that have not yet completed socialist transformation to carry out socialist self-education and self-transformation, so as to eliminate the exploiting classes. Is it that once the exploiting classes are eliminated, self-education and self-transformation are no longer needed? It is still needed. We know that people's ideological changes often lag behind changes in their social status. After members of the bourgeoisie change to become laborers, the remnants of their bourgeois ideology will still drag on for a long time, and they will still need a long time to carry out self-education and self-transformation. There will still be a contradiction between the working class ideology and the bourgeois ideology within the state civil servants for a long time, which needs to be gradually overcome through self-education. Therefore, we must use the methods of self-education and self-transformation for a long time in order to develop political and ideological socialist consistency.

Overcome sectarianism

Over the past eleven years, the implementation of our Party's united front policy has achieved great results. However, it is not that there are no problems in the united front work, but that there are still many problems. Some problems are a reflection of the new situation that has emerged after fundamental changes have taken place in the domestic political situation, and some problems reflect the shortcomings and problems in our work. As far as the work of the united front work departments is concerned, there are vulgar tendencies of accommodation, but the main problem is sectarianism. In ethnic relations, some comrades still have Han chauvinist tendencies, mainly manifested in not paying attention to ethnic minority work, and not being willing to listen to and respect the opinions of fraternal ethnic cadres. In the relationship with democratic parties, non-party democratic figures, and other patriotic figures, some comrades' contact with non-Party figures is often limited to a few people; some comrades adopt a cold and alienated attitude towards the more backward people, and have not seriously implemented Chairman Mao's instructions: "Do not despise them, look down on them, but approach them, unite them, persuade them, and encourage them to move forward." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, p. 485) Some comrades do not adopt an attitude of thorough openness and appropriate analysis towards the different opinions of non-Party figures, but simply reject them. The united front work departments should thoroughly expose and correct these problems and other problems in their work in accordance with the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Party. When inspecting the work, pay attention to listening to the opinions of non-Party figures. In the past half a year or so, we have invited democratic parties and non-party democratic figures to jointly inspect the united front work in the central government and many places across the country, and we have benefited a lot. In the future, we will use this method more systematically. In order to further strengthen the Party's united front work, it is required that the local Party committees periodically deploy and inspect it, urge the united front work departments to work well, and at the same time urge the relevant Party departments and the relevant Party organizations in state organs, schools, and enterprises to take up this work.

We believe that after the Party's National Congress, the work of the people's democratic united front will be further developed in all aspects.

### 进一步加强党的统一战线工作

专栏：

    进一步加强党的统一战线工作
    中共中央统一战线工作部部长　李维汉同志的发言
    我完全拥护毛主席的开幕词和刘少奇同志、邓小平同志、周恩来同志代表中央委员会所作的报告。
    从党的第七次全国代表大会到第八次全国代表大会的十一年间，由于中央正确路线的领导，我国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派和无党派民主人士、各人民团体团结在人民民主统一战线之内，取得了新民主主义革命的彻底胜利，又取得了社会主义革命的决定性胜利。
    我国的历史条件和社会条件，决定了革命统一战线的必要性、广泛性和它的发展的长期性。在中国共产党的领导下，从长期革命斗争中形成和发展起来的人民民主统一战线，是以工农联盟为基础，而又包括一切可以合作的非劳动人民在内的广泛的联盟。离开了工农联盟，就不可能有人民民主统一战线，不可能有革命的胜利，党总是要以全力扩大和巩固工农联盟。同时，同可以合作的非劳动人民的联盟，又能够辅助工农联盟壮大革命势力、孤立反革命势力、并教育同盟者，是统一战线的不可缺少的部分，所以，党总是要团结一切可以团结的力量。这后一个联盟，曾经在不同的历史条件下包括一切可以长期合作和只能暂时合作的阶级、阶层和集团，但是，在这些非劳动人民同盟者里面有一个长期占着重要地位的阶级，这就是民族资产阶级。
    对民族资产阶级的统一战线工作
    民族资产阶级包括他们的知识分子在内，不论过去和现在都在社会上有很大的影响，同时不论对于民主革命和社会主义革命都具有两面性。他们基本上是反对帝国主义的。由于这一点，他们不仅是中国工人阶级在民主革命阶段的同盟军，而且从国际革命阵线说来，也是世界无产阶级的同盟军。就在我们国家的社会主义革命阶段，他们仍然保持了反帝爱国的立场，并在恢复国民经济和发展工业建设、发展现代文化和技术上有积极作用。但是，“民族资产阶级的社会经济地位规定了他们的软弱性，他们缺乏远见，缺乏足够的勇气，并且有不少人害怕民众”（论人民民主专政），所以，他们对于新民主主义革命走过了参加、附和反革命、中立、最后才又参加过来的曲折道路。而且他们参加新民主主义革命的主观愿望是为要争取中国的资本主义前途，因此，在中华人民共和国成立以后，他们同工人阶级之间就逐步地进入了资本主义同社会主义“谁战胜谁”的斗争。由于民族资产阶级的这种影响和两面性，工人阶级同民族资产阶级的关系如何，就不仅关系于工人阶级能否争取中间势力和孤立反动势力的问题，而且影响到工人阶级对农民和城市小资产阶级实现领导权的斗争，而且影响到国家的两个前途的斗争。所以，同民族资产阶级的关系，从来就是我们党的总路线中的一个重要问题。
    采取积极争取和又团结又斗争、以斗争求团结的政策
    在一九三五年党的遵义会议以前，党的某几个时期的领导在这个重要问题上犯过“一切联合，否认斗争”的右倾机会主义错误，又犯过“一切斗争，否认联合”的左倾机会主义错误。遵义会议以后，以毛泽东同志为首的党中央纠正了这些错误，而根据民族资产阶级的两面性，采取了积极争取和又团结又斗争、以斗争求团结的政策。因此，争取了民族资产阶级参加抗日民族统一战线，并使他们在国民党顽固派和共产党之间大体保持中立，一部分人对我们同情。这就有利于我们党在当时环境中发展进步势力，争取其他中间势力，孤立顽固势力，克服顽固派进行分裂、投降的危险。抗日战争胜利以后，也即是党的第七次全国代表大会以后，我们党根据新的政治形势，联合民族资产阶级进行反对内战、独裁和争取和平、民主的斗争；又在这个斗争中对于他们中的无原则让步的倾向作了耐心的说服和批判。在人民解放战争期间，我们同民族资产阶级继续保持了反对独裁、内战的斗争联盟；但是，我们曾经不能不对他们中间发生的“中间路线”即“第三条道路”进行严肃的斗争，因为这是一条不赞同彻底的土地改革，不赞同推翻整个国民党统治，并对美帝国主义的“鼓励民主个人主义”等等抱有很大幻想的带反动性质的路线。我们党帮助他们从人民解放战争的胜利发展和国民党统治区人民反对内战、独裁、饥饿和反对美帝国主义的广大运动中受到教育，终于抛弃了“中间路线”。中华人民共和国成立以后，经过抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命分子三大运动的教育，又帮助他们进一步批判了“中间路线”的思想残余。这个克服“中间路线”的斗争，是争取人民革命的彻底性和工人阶级对国家的领导权的斗争，归根到底是争取国家的社会主义前途的斗争。这对于民族资产阶级的历史命运，也是一个转折点，他们从此开始在实际上接受工人阶级的领导。这样，并且由于“五反”（反对行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报）运动的教育，使他们进一步接受了工人阶级的领导，就使得我们完全有可能在人民民主专政日益巩固和社会主义经济日益发展的基础上，经过和平改造的方法，逐步地使他们放弃资本主义道路，放弃社会主义同资本主义两种经济成分长期共存、和平共处等等幻想，而接受了社会主义道路。
    争取和改造民族资产阶级的五点经验
    两个革命的历史都证明：统一战线是阶级斗争的武器和特殊形式。“统一战线政策就是阶级政策，二者不可分割”。（毛泽东选集七六三页）一切机会主义者弄不清这一点，而把阶级斗争和统一战线对立起来——右倾机会主义者认为要保持统一战线，只好放弃阶级斗争和无产阶级的独立性；左倾机会主义者则把一切斗争和否认统一战线称为阶级政策。我们党在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央领导下，坚持执行了积极争取和又团结又斗争、以斗争求团结的政策，从而正确地处理了阶级斗争和统一战线的关系，成功地争取了并且已经在基本上改造了民族资产阶级。在对民族资产阶级执行这个政策的经验中，主要的有以下几点：（一）中国的民族资产阶级是一个有很大的动摇性和软弱性的阶级。工人阶级必须一方面坚持不懈地扩大和巩固工农联盟，壮大革命势力，另一方面同帝国主义和国内反动势力进行坚决而又机智的斗争，才能逐步地把民族资产阶级争取过来。（二）照顾同盟者的合理利益，是争取同盟者必要的条件。我们党远在抗日时期，就吸收了民族资产阶级的政治代表参加根据地的民主政权，并且执行了“公私兼顾、劳资两利”的经济政策；这个政策一直继续到中华人民共和国成立以后的一个时期。大家知道，在社会主义改造运动中，我们的政府继续照顾了民族资产阶级的合理利益，并保证他们在阶级消灭以后有工作上、生活上的出路和光明前途。（三）向他们长期反复地进行说服教育。最主要的是实际的教育，即引导他们从实际政治经验中接受教育；同时把实际教育同耐心说理结合起来，把鼓励同批评结合起来。（四）在他们中间发展进步力量，争取中间分子向左转，更多地教育和等待落后分子，孤立和分化少数顽固分子。注意培养进步核心力量，使他们能发挥带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用。（五）把民族资产阶级的知识分子同民族资本家区别开来。因为资产阶级知识分子一般不占有生产资料，他们是掌握现代科学文化的骨干，又比较富于爱国心和政治感觉，对民族资本家有重大影响。所以我们在革命胜利前就已经向他们长期地进行了争取和教育的工作。革命胜利后，大多数资产阶级知识分子迅速地转到为人民共和国诚实供职，他们的政治立场又随着思想改造的进展，逐步地转到工人阶级的立场上来，这些都不是偶然的。他们的这种态度和行动，对民族资本家接受社会主义改造起了重要的推动作用。
    民主党派和无党派民主人士发挥了重要作用
    各民主党派和无党派民主人士对于我们争取民族资产阶级、上层小资产阶级和他们的知识分子，曾经给了很大的帮助。由于民族资产阶级、上层小资产阶级和他们的知识分子，在过去和现在都是民主党派的社会基础，我们同这些阶级、阶层建立又联合又斗争的关系，在中华人民共和国成立以前主要是经过各民主党派和无党派民主人士。在中华人民共和国成立以后，我们同这些阶级、阶层直接建立了多方面的联系。但是，在团结、教育和改造这些阶级、阶层的工作中，各民主党派和无党派民主人士仍然起了重要作用，并且还将继续发挥重要作用。在将来这些阶级、阶层改变成为劳动人民以后，各民主党派和无党派民主人士将继续在这一部分劳动人民中进行工作，将继续联系和代表他们可以联系和代表的一部分劳动人民，并且同我们党长期共存，互相监督。
    对少数民族上层人士的统一战线工作
    下面，我讲一点关于少数民族上层人士、宗教界爱国人士和国外华侨方面的统一战线工作。
    各少数民族内部多少都有一些上层人士，他们是前资本主义的或者资本主义的剥削者以及这些剥削阶级的知识分子。他们同劳动人民间的矛盾，只有经过社会改革（包括民主改革和社会主义改造）才能解决。另一方面，这些上层人士的大多数具有爱国立场，在民族关系上，部分的还在宗教关系上，同劳动人民有一定的联系，成为本民族的公众领袖。一部分少数民族中，这种公众领袖有很大的影响。我们党很早以来，就对于少数民族公众领袖这两个方面的情况作了正确的估计，并对他们采取了争取、团结的政策。因此，在革命胜利以前，我们已经同许多少数民族的公众领袖建立了反对帝国主义和反对国民党反动统治的统一战线。中华人民共和国成立以后，这方面的统一战线更加扩大和巩固了。借助于这方面的统一战线，我们经过和平方式解放了西藏，我们同许多过去没有联系或者很少联系的少数民族人民群众发生了联系，开展了工作，这就是对劳动人民的联盟起了辅助作用。在民族的团结方面，在社会改革中，许多少数民族的公众领袖做了有益的工作；同时他们自己也受到了政治教育，获得不同程度的进步。在我国的条件下，各民族的社会主义改造是采用和平方法进行的。一部分需要实行民主改革的少数民族地区，因为那里的社会发展情况特殊，也必须采取和平方法去进行。正是由于劳动人民同公众领袖间的统一战线的存在和发展，使和平改革成为必要，也成为可能。和平改革是阶级斗争的一种特殊形式，即依靠劳动人民，团结一切可以团结的力量，采用逐步的迂回曲折的方法来达到民主革命和社会革命的目的。不是通过强力斗争的方式强迫剥削者放弃剥削，而是通过和平协商的方式说服他们愿意放弃剥削；同时，国家采取适当办法保证不降低他们的政治地位和生活水平。关于社会改革的具体政策、办法、步骤、部署和时间等等问题，由劳动人民的代表和公众领袖们进行认真的协商，双方真正赞成了，才动手进行改革，否则宁肯慢一点，等待酝酿成熟了的时候再进行。这里，说服劳动人民采取某些必要的、合理的让步，是有积极意义的。有的地方存在着对少数民族公众领袖的影响估计不足、同他们协商不够的缺点，应当加以改正。同时还必须耐心地帮助公众领袖们和其他上层分子进行自我教育，帮助他们主动地向劳动人民靠拢，以便取得劳动人民的谅解，实现长期合作。和平改革可以促进民族团结；可以减少以至避免生产力和社会财富的破坏（许多少数民族地区的生产力水平很低，社会财富很贫乏，更应当尽可能避免破坏）；可以争取一批知识分子为社会主义服务（少数民族中的知识分子很少，更应当尽可能把他们争取和教育过来）。所以我们在少数民族地区应当认真地执行和平改革的方针。
    对宗教界爱国人士的统一战线工作
    我国有佛教、道教、伊斯兰教和基督教（包括新旧两派）等宗教。宗教问题在我国社会问题中占有相当重要的地位。佛教、道教和伊斯兰教在我国有悠久的历史，佛教和伊斯兰教在一部分少数民族中有普遍深入的影响；道教以外的几种宗教都有国际联系。在旧中国时代，帝国主义和国民党反动派都曾经多方控制宗教界，力图把宗教变为他们的工具。中华人民共和国成立以后，我们党和政府经过各种方式，向宗教界进行了反帝爱国教育，帮助他们摆脱帝国主义和国民党反动派的影响，揭露和清除反革命分子，从而保障了宗教界的爱国自由，并使他们团结在人民民主统一战线之内。同时，我们党和政府实行了彻底的宗教信仰自由政策。这就是：信教或者不信教是自由的；信仰那一种宗教、那一个教派，是自由的；现在信教、将来不信，或者现在不信、将来又信教，也是自由的。这样就改进了宗教界同非宗教界之间以及宗教界内部的团结。在我们国家内，只要人民中有人信仰宗教，我们就尊重他们的信仰自由，保护他们所信仰的宗教。共产党是唯物主义者，所以不信仰宗教；同时共产党是历史唯物主义者，懂得宗教必然会在长时期内存在的原因，所以采取了长期尊重宗教信仰自由的政策。在处理宗教问题上还有采用行政手段的情况，是必须纠正的。
    对国外华侨的统一战线工作
    在国外华侨中，也已经广泛地形成了并且发展了爱国统一战线。华侨素来具有爱国传统，祖国的独立和几年来的成就又更加鼓舞他们发扬了这种传统。我们国家在华侨方面所采取的政策和措施，更加促进了华侨的团结互助，促进了他们同侨居国政府和人民的关系的改善。这些政策和措施是：（一）坚决保护华侨的正当权利和利益；允许华侨根据自愿原则选择国籍；劝导他们同侨居国人民保持友好关系，遵守侨居国法律，不干涉侨居国内政。（二）号召华侨在爱护祖国、保护自己正当权益的基础上，不分籍贯、职业、阶级和信仰广泛地团结起来，帮助各种华侨的团体、学校、报纸和各方面的华侨领袖在上述基础上消除隔阂，实行合作。（三）保护华侨汇款，优待华侨投资；欢迎华侨回国参加建设或者参加学习，并给予便利。（四）照顾国内侨眷的特殊情况和需要，并逐步地引导他们同全国人民一道参加国家的社会主义建设。这些政策和措施受到广大华侨的赞同和拥护，我们要继续贯彻执行，并要克服侨眷区和其他方面工作中的一些缺点。
    今后的任务
    今后，人民民主统一战线的任务是继续团结一切可以团结的力量，调动一切可以调动的积极因素，为完成社会主义改造，把中国建成一个伟大的社会主义国家而共同奋斗。社会主义革命的决定性胜利造成了有利的条件，使我们有可能充分地调动在过去条件下不可能调动的或者由于我们工作的缺点而没有得到充分发挥的积极因素，也可能把一部分消极因素化成积极因素，来为社会主义服务。为了这个目的，我们应当在中华人民共和国宪法的基础上发扬统一战线中的民主传统，主要的是政治协商、共同工作、互相监督和自我教育的传统。发扬政治协商的传统
    政治协商是我国实现人民民主的重要方法。我国人民民主统一战线的内部关系是经过协商来调整的，国家事务中的重要问题是协商成熟而后决定的，国家的选举也是经过协商提名的。正是由于在协商过程中反复地交换了意见，展开了争论，从而辨明了是非，达成了协议，在进行选举和通过议案的时候，就自然而然地常常出现最大多数一致以至全体一致的赞同和决议。政治协商并不抹杀阶级矛盾，不对阶级矛盾作无原则的调和；政治协商的好处在于既能实现最大多数人民的民主权利，又能尊重占少数地位的人民的民主权利，在经过充分协商之后，使各方面的政见在基本上达到适当的集中和统一。这里所谓占少数地位的人民，就是各民主党派、无党派民主人士和其他爱国人士所联系和代表的一部分人民。尊重这部分人民的民主权利，是人民民主统一战线获得巩固和扩大的必要条件。我们党中央和国家领导机关，一向注意发挥政治协商的作用，特别是在采取重大措施的时候，如果没有同有关的党外人士进行充分的协商，宁肯慢一点作决定。凡是应当经过广泛协商的问题，都提到中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会去协商，有些还同时提到中国人民政治协商会议各省、市、自治区委员会去协商。中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会和地方委员会是政治协商机关，又是统一战线组织，在统一战线和国家政治生活中起着重要作用。党中央和毛主席十分重视人民政协的工作，我们应当努力使它的活动更加充实和活跃起来。
    正确处理同党外人员共同工作的关系
    几年来，我们党在国家机关、学校和企业中同党外人员共同工作的关系愈来愈广泛，特别是在资本主义生产关系发生了根本变化以后，这种共同工作的关系达到了包括绝大多数资方人员在内的规模。正确地处理这种关系，在国家政治生活中有很重要的意义。这里比较普遍存在的一个主要问题，是怎样保证党外人员有职有权。我们认为，解决这个问题的关键在于同党外人员认真地实行以共产党为核心的集体领导和分工负责相结合的制度。机关、学校、企业和武装部队中的共产党党组或者党委对于工作上和业务上的重要问题进行讨论，提出建议，是完全必要的；但是还必须经过适当的方式同有关的党外人员进行充分的协商，然后提到行政会议认真讨论，作出决定。这样，才既能实现共产党的核心领导作用，又能在行政上同党外人员实行集体领导。有些人把共产党的核心领导作用和行政权力对立起来，那是不对的。对于党外人员分担的职责，应当切实尊重，使他们能够处理应当由他们处理的问题，参加或者主持应当由他们参加或者主持的会议，阅读他们应当阅读的文件。在工作中要给他们以充分的支持和帮助，使他们能够在共同事业中发挥长处，作出成绩，获得进步。此外，某些党外人员的安排使用有不适当的情形，应当加以改正。
    创造必要条件，便利党外人士对我们进行监督
    充分发扬政治协商和共同工作的民主传统，就同时有利于互相监督。就我们党来说，毛主席早就指出：“我们不怕说出自己的毛病，我们一定要改正自己的毛病。我们要加强党内教育来清除这些毛病，我们还要经过和党外人士实行民主合作来清除这些毛病。这样的内外夹攻，才能把我们的毛病治好，才能把国事真正办好起来。”（毛泽东选集八三二页）现在我们党在全国人民中居于核心领导的地位，更需要这样的内外夹攻。我们需要来自广大劳动群众的监督，这是基本的依靠。同时我们还需要来自各民主党派和无党派民主人士的监督，因为他们代表了社会上一个方面的意见和要求，并且有一定的政治经验和业务专长，往往能够向我们提出中肯的批评和意见，即使有些批评和意见不中肯或者不正确，也有助于我们认真地分析和处理问题，保持清醒的头脑。我们必须创造一切必要的条件，以便利民主党派和无党派民主人士对我们进行监督。组织定期的和不定期的视察；在人民代表大会、人民政治协商会议和其他国家机关的会议上充分展开批评和自我批评；各机关内部的我党组织同民主党派组织和民主人士之间、各有关机关同有关的民主党派、民主人士和人民团体之间，进行座谈和协商；这些都是已经行之有效的办法，应当更广泛更认真地来做，并形成制度。
    运用自我教育和自我改造方法
    自我教育和自我改造，今后仍然是人民民主统一战线的一项重要任务。首先，民族资本家和他们的代理人还需要几年的时间才能完成从剥削者转变为劳动者的改造；一部分资产阶级知识分子还需要继续努力使自己的政治立场完全转到工人阶级的立场上来；而一部分少数民族上层人士和其他爱国分子的自我改造可能需要更多的时间。因此，需要继续执行又团结又斗争、又鼓励又批评的政策，推动还没有完成社会主义改造的阶级、阶层进行社会主义的自我教育和自我改造，达到消灭剥削阶级。是否剥削阶级一消灭，自我教育和自我改造就不需要了？还是需要的。我们知道，人们的思想变化是常常落后于他们的社会地位的变化的。资产阶级成员改变成为劳动者以后，他们的资产阶级思想的残余还会拖得很长，还需要一个很长的时间来进行自我教育和自我改造，国家公职人员内部还会在一个很长的时间内存在工人阶级思想和资产阶级思想的矛盾，要靠自我教育来逐步加以克服。所以，我们要长期地运用自我教育和自我改造的方法，以发展政治上和思想上的社会主义一致性。
    克服宗派主义情绪
    十一年来，我们党的统一战线政策的执行获得很大的成绩。但是，统一战线工作方面不是没有问题了，而是问题还不少。有一些问题是国内政治形势发生根本变化以后出现的新的情况的反映，有一些问题则反映了我们工作中的缺点和毛病。就统一战线工作部门的工作说，庸俗的迁就主义倾向是有的，但是主要的毛病却是宗派主义情绪。在民族关系上，有些同志还有大汉族主义倾向，主要表现在不重视少数民族工作，不愿意听取和尊重兄弟民族干部的意见。在同民主党派、无党派民主人士和其他爱国人士的关系上，有些同志对党外人士的联系往往局限在少数人当中；有些同志对于比较落后的人们，采取冷淡和疏远的态度，没有认真执行毛主席的指示：“不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”（毛泽东选集四八五页）有些同志对于党外人士的不同意见，不是采取彻底敞开、适当分析的态度，而是简单地加以排斥。统一战线工作部门应当根据党的第八次全国代表大会的精神，彻底揭发和改正工作中的这些毛病和其它的毛病。在检查工作的时候，要注意听取党外人士的意见。最近大半年来，我们在中央和全国许多地方邀请了民主党派和无党派民主人士共同检查统一战线工作，得益甚多。今后要更有计划地运用这个方法。为要进一步加强党的统一战线工作，要求各地方党委定期地加以部署和检查，督促统一战线工作部门好好工作，同时督促党的有关的部门和国家机关、学校、企业中有关的党的组织把这项工作抓起来。
    我们相信，在党的全国代表大会以后，人民民主统一战线工作将在一切方面获得进一步的开展。
