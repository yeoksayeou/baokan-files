Speech by Comrade Qin Yuping, Secretary of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

I fully endorse Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech and the three reports of the Central Committee.

I would like to talk about the handicraft industry in Changsha.

The handicraft industry in Changsha is relatively developed, with fifty-three trades and more than 30,000 people. Its total annual output value accounts for 13.47% of the city's total industrial and handicraft output value. Since January of this year, the vast majority of handicraftsmen have joined production cooperatives and other cooperative organizations.

Since the handicraftsmen have been organized, there has been much progress in production. However, there are still many problems in how to better improve production and consolidate cooperatives, such as chaotic production management, weak political work; some industries have excessively concentrated organizational forms, with cooperatives that are too large, which is neither convenient for consumers nor easy to manage; there are also some problems with wages and benefits; some important industries such as metal and bamboo and wood, have also caused confusion due to the congestion of production tasks. We are in the process of solving the first three problems according to the instructions of the Central Committee and the Hunan Provincial Party Committee. Here I would like to focus on the last problem.

In the past, the metal handicraft workers and private and local state-owned machinery factories in Changsha relied on repairing machines, manufacturing parts, and producing consumer goods to maintain their business. Since the beginning of this year, the situation has changed greatly. A large number of batch manufacturing tasks have been released from all sides. All factories and metal handicraft workers are fully occupied due to accepting these tasks. The original repair and parts businesses and the temporary small batch manufacturing and parts processing of some industrial, commercial, and capital construction units are not being undertaken by anyone. A number of small and odd items needed for people's lives are nowhere to be bought, and there is no place to repair broken appliances. Because these factories and handicraft cooperatives cannot meet these objective needs, it has promoted the increase of individual households and the development of free markets. Individual households, due to undertaking too many and too large tasks, cannot handle them themselves, so on the one hand, they raise prices to seek exorbitant profits; on the other hand, they hire members of production cooperatives with high wages to rush their tasks. As a result, many members demanded to withdraw from the cooperative, or took "sick leave" during the day and did private work at night, or even simply went absent from work and ignored cooperative affairs. Therefore, the production in the cooperative is not good, and the members' minds are in chaos. Similar situations exist in the bamboo and wood handicrafts in Changsha.

I think that although this problem is prominently manifested in the handicraft industry, it is by no means just a problem of the handicraft industry. To solve this problem, first of all, we should investigate and study the historical situation of cooperative production between handicrafts and industry, and make overall arrangements for the manufacturing tasks, repair tasks, and production of consumer goods that must be undertaken by industry and handicrafts. Secondly, industry and handicrafts should actively take measures to tap production potential from all aspects; appropriately add equipment (the machinery and metal industries can allocate old machines from large industries), and train technical personnel; if it is really necessary, we should also consider building some small machinery manufacturing factories, and not just use repair factories as manufacturing factories, excessively weakening the repair force. Thirdly, we must consider "compressing" some of the batch processing and ordering tasks that have been released from all sides. Changsha manufactured 37,000 rice threshers in the first half of this year, and I heard that tens of percent of them were not used; the same is true for double-wheeled double-shared plows. More than 1,000 "209" water pumps manufactured by the Changsha Machinery Factory, I heard that the relevant central departments recently discovered that the power was insufficient, and they could not be used even if they were manufactured, so the order was cancelled. It can be seen from this that some of the current batch processing and ordering tasks are not all actually needed, and compressing this part of the orders can reduce the current confusion.

Based on the above situation, we are strengthening the education of cadres and members of handicraft cooperatives; rationally handling the issues of wages, benefits, and the arrangement of supplementary labor for cooperative members' families; at the same time, strengthening market management, and starting to appropriately organize the individual households that still exist, taking care of and arranging their production, and strengthening their education. We have already designated fourteen metal cooperatives to specialize in repair business, and bamboo and wood industries have also allocated a part of their forces to meet the needs of retail sales; in the joint state-private machinery industry, two factories have also been designated to specialize in repairs, and the remaining cooperatives and factories must also undertake some repair tasks. After doing this, the situation has improved. I think that in the future, some state-owned and local state-owned machinery factories also need to reserve a certain amount of manpower to undertake some more complex and advanced repair tasks in order to improve the collaborative relationship between them and to satisfy social needs. The relevant central and provincial departments need to do a good job in the overall arrangement of processing tasks, and strengthen the review of some batch decentralized processing and ordering plans to ensure the reliability of the plans.

### 加强工业和手工业的生产协作

    加强工业和手工业的生产协作
    中共长沙市委员会书记　秦雨屏同志的发言
    毛泽东同志的开幕词和中央委员会的三个报告，我完全拥护。
    我想在这里说一说长沙市的手工业问题。
    长沙市手工业比较发达，有五十三个行业，三万多人，全年总产值占全市工业手工业总产值的百分之十三点四七。今年一月以来绝大多数手工业者都已参加生产合作社等合作组织。
    手工业者组织起来以后，生产上已经有了很多进步。但是，如何更好地搞好生产和巩固合作社，还存在不少问题：如生产管理混乱，政治工作薄弱；有些行业组织形式过于集中，社过大，既不便于消费者，也不便于管理；工资福利也有些问题；金属、竹木等一部分重要行业，由于生产任务拥挤还造成了混乱现象。对于前三个问题，我们正在根据中央和湖南省委的指示进行解决，这里我想着重说说后一个问题。
    往年，长沙的金属业手工业者和私营、地方国营机械业工厂，差不多都依靠修理机器、制造零件和人民生活用品维持营业。今年以来，情况有了很大变化，大量的成批的制造任务从各方面放下来，所有的工厂和金属业的手工业者都因接受了这些任务，而吃得很饱，原来的修配业务和某些工业、商业、基本建设单位临时性的小批制造和零件加工却无人承接了，人民生活需要的若干零星用具无处购买，用具破损了也找不到修理的地方。由于这些工厂和手工业合作社不能满足这些客观需要，就促使单干户增多，自由市场发展。单干户因承接任务过多过大，自己干不过来，就一方面抬高价格谋取厚利；一方面用高额工资雇用生产合作社的社员为他们赶任务。致使不少社员要求退社，或者白天请“病假”，晚上干私活，甚至干脆旷工，不理社务。因此社里的生产搞不好，社员的思想很混乱。长沙的竹器、木器等手工业也有类似的情况。
    我认为这个问题虽然是突出地表现在手工业方面，但绝不只是手工业的问题。要解决这个问题，首先，应该调查研究手工业和工业协作生产的历史情况，对于工业和手工业必须承担的制造任务、修配任务和人民生活用品的生产作统筹安排。其次，工业、手工业都应该积极采取措施从各方面挖掘生产潜力；适当地添置设备（机械业、金属业可以从大工业里调拨陈旧机器），培养训练技术力量；如果确有必要，还应考虑兴建一些小型的机械制造厂，不要光是把修配厂当制造厂用，过分地削弱了修配力量。再次，就是要考虑“压缩”一下从各方面放下来的某些成批的加工订货任务。长沙市今年上半年制造了三万七千台打稻机，听说有百分之几十没有使用；双轮双铧犁也有同样的情形。长沙机械厂承制的一千多台“二○九”号水泵，听说最近中央有关主管部门发现动力不足，制造出来也无法使用，因此取消订货了。由此可见，现在有些成批的加工订货并不都是实际需要的，压缩这部分订货就可以减少目前的混乱现象。
    根据上述情况，我们正在加强对手工业合作社的干部和社员的教育工作；合理地处理工资福利问题和社员家庭辅助劳动力的安排问题；同时，加强对市场的管理，着手把现在还存在的单干户适当地组织起来，照顾和安排他们的生产，加强对他们的教育。我们已经划出了十四个金属合作社专门承接修配业务，竹木业也划出了一部分力量来满足门市需要；在公私合营机械工业中也指定了两个厂子专作修配，其余的社和厂子也要承担一些修配任务。这样作了以后，情况已有好转。我认为今后有些国营、地方国营机械厂也需要留出一定力量以承担某些比较复杂、高级的修配任务，以健全彼此之间的协作关系和满足社会需要。中央和省的有关主管部门，需要作好加工任务的统筹安排工作，对某些成批下放的加工订货计划要加强审核工作，以保证计划的可靠性。
