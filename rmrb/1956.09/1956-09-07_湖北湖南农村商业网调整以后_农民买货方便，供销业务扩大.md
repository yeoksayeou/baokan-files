Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 5th: After nearly two months of commercial network adjustments, new commercial institutions have spread throughout rural Hubei. Many once-desolate villages and bays now have new stores. Farmers in mountainous areas, who used to face the most inconvenient shopping, no longer have to trek over mountains to attend markets. They can buy daily necessities locally or in neighboring areas.

Hubei Province originally had relatively few commercial retail outlets, with only over 12,000 retail points throughout the province, from plains to mountains, and most of them were located in market towns. Farmers in the mountainous areas of eastern Hubei had to travel as far as sixty *li* to find a branch store of a supply and marketing cooperative. During the busy farming season, these areas' farmers couldn't even get enough salt. After this commercial network adjustment, there is a retail point every five *li* in the plains, and farmers in the mountains only have to travel fifteen *li* at most to buy things. Zhujiahu, in Junshan Township, Hanyang County, is surrounded by twelve large and small villages. In the past, farmers had to wade across a river to Huangling Town, eight *li* away, to buy even needles and thread, wasting most of a day's work on the round trip. Since the Huangling Supply and Marketing Cooperative set up a supply point in Zhujiahu, they no longer worry about losing work points because of going to market.

Most of the new retail points are formed by drawing a portion of the capital and manpower from the small merchants and peddlers who have already been organized in market towns. Under the leadership and assistance of state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives, they are actively improving their management and service quality to prepare for the upcoming peak season. The variety of goods in these retail points has generally expanded to about one hundred items. Small merchants and peddlers who had difficulty operating in towns have seen a significant improvement in their business after setting up retail points in rural areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, September 4th: After the widespread adjustment of rural commercial networks in Hunan Province, farmers find it more convenient to buy goods than before, and the sales and procurement business of local supply and marketing cooperatives and joint state-private stores and cooperative stores in market towns have generally expanded.

Hunan Province began adjusting its rural commercial network in late May, and by early August, more than 4,300 new retail points had been established in rural areas throughout the province. In the past, farmers in mountainous areas generally had to travel ten to twenty *li*, and farmers in plain areas also had to travel six to twelve *li* to buy things. Now, farmers living in mountainous areas only have to walk four to ten *li*, and those in plain areas only need to walk three to five *li* to buy daily necessities. According to farmers of the Wanchong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liling County, the local supply and marketing cooperative's establishment of supply points in rural areas saves the cooperative nearly 1,000 labor days per year that would have been spent going to market to buy goods.

Most of these newly established retail points are doing very well. After the Xianchaqiao District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shaodong County set up two supply stores and four consignment stores in the countryside in July, the sales volume for that month increased by 56.2% compared to June, and also increased by 27.2% compared to the same period last year. Most of the newly established retail points are small merchants and joint state-private stores that were previously concentrated in towns. After arrangements were made, they were dispersed to the countryside as consignment stores of supply and marketing cooperatives, and some also handled partial distribution business. These private merchants have generally expanded their business and increased their income after going to the countryside. A joint venture grocery store in Huilong Temple, Xinning County, increased its turnover by 1,400 yuan in June after setting up four supply points in the countryside. During the adjustment, there were also individual newly added retail points that experienced a decline in turnover due to being established in inappropriate locations. Various places are now adjusting these improperly located retail points.

    湖北湖南农村商业网调整以后
    农民买货方便，供销业务扩大
    新华社武汉5日电　经过近二个月的商业网调整工作，新的商业机构已经遍布湖北各地农村。许多一向冷寂的村湾里出现了新的商店，过去买卖东西最不方便的山区农民，不用再翻山越岭去赶集，可以在本地或邻近地区买到日用品了。
    湖北省原来的商业零售机构比较少，全省从平原到山区只有一万二千多个零售点，而且大多数分布在集镇上。鄂东大山区的农民最远要跑六十里路才看得到一个供销合作社的分销店，每当农忙季节，这些地区的农民连食盐也吃不上。这次调整商业网以后，平原地区每隔五里路就有一个零售点，山区农民买东西最多也只要跑十五里路了。汉阳县军山乡朱家湖周围有十二个大小村湾，过去农民买些针线也要淌水过河到八里以外的黄陵镇去，往返一次要耽误大半天的生产。自从黄陵供销合作社在朱家湖设立供销点以后，他们不再担心因为赶集而少得劳动工分了。
    新的零售点绝大部分是由集镇上已经组织起来的小商小贩抽出一部分资金和人力分散组成的。它们在国营商业和供销合作社的领导和帮助下，正在积极改善经营管理，提高服务质量，迎接即将到来的旺季。这些零售点的商品的花色品种一般扩大到了一百种左右。原来集中在城镇上经营有困难的小商小贩，到农村设立零售点以后，营业情况大大好转。
    新华社长沙4日电　湖南省农村普遍调整商业网以后，农民买货比过去方便，各地基层供销合作社和集镇上的公私合营商店、合作商店的销售和收购业务，一般都有扩大。
    湖南省调整农村商业网的工作是5月下旬开始的，到8月上旬，全省农村中新设了四千三百多个零售点。过去山区农民一般要跑十里到二十里，平原地区农民也要跑六里到十二里才能买到东西，现在居住在山区的农民只要走四里到十里，平原地区只需走三、五里路就可买到日用品了。据醴陵县湾冲农业生产合作社的农民反映：由于当地供销社在农村设立供应点，这个社一年中可节省近一千个上市购买货物的劳动日。
    新设的这些零售点，大多数营业情况都很好。邵东县仙槎桥区供销合作社7月份在乡村设立两个供应店、四个代销店以后，这个月的销售额就比6月份上升56.2％，比去年同时期也上升27.2％。新设的零售点，大部分是过去集中在城镇上的小商贩和公私合营商店，经过安排，他们被分散到农村成为供销合作社的代销店，也有一些办理部分经销业务。这些私商下乡以后，业务一般都扩大了，增加了收入。新宁县回龙寺一个合营杂货商店，6月份设立四个供销点到农村以后，6月份营业额就上升了一千四百元。在调整中，也有个别新增的零售点由于设立的地方不适当，营业额下降。现在各地正对这些地点不当的零售点加以调整。
