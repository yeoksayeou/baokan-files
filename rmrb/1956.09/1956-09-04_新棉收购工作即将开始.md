    New Cotton Purchasing Work to Begin Soon
    (Our report) In some areas of Xinjiang, Jiangxi, Shandong and other provinces, new cotton has begun to fluff, and it is expected to be generally available on the market around mid-September. This year, the purchasing departments in various regions have generally started their peak season purchasing preparations earlier than last year. After the pre-purchase work in April and May, the review of pre-purchase contracts was immediately carried out. Therefore, the purchasing preparation work has been largely completed by now, and purchasing will begin soon.
    In Jiangsu and Shandong, more than 80% of cotton ginning factories have completed machine repairs. During the new cotton purchasing period, all cotton ginning factories in Jiangsu Province will also promote the rapid light ginning method to increase production and complete the ginning tasks on time. Processing contracts have also been signed with agricultural cooperatives for manual cotton ginning machines, based on the principle of "overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement." Henan, Jiangsu and other provinces have also made full preparations for purchasing, packaging equipment, and tarpaulins.
    In order to thoroughly understand the farmers' sales requirements and formulate purchasing methods that benefit both the state and the farmers, thirty counties in Jiangsu Province, such as Nantong and Sheyang, have conducted typical surveys and pilot projects, and exchanged pilot project experiences from various regions. The establishment of the purchasing network should also be made as convenient as possible for farmers to sell.
    This year, more than 18,000 cotton inspectors, accountants and preservation workers across the country have received training, and their political and professional levels have been improved. (Zhang Xing)

    新棉收购工作即将开始
    本报讯　新疆、江西、山东等省部分地区新棉已开始吐絮，预计9月中旬前后可普遍上市。今年各地采购部门的旺季收购准备工作，一般比去年早。4、5月间预购工作结束后，紧接着就展开了预购合同的复查，因此收购准备工作到目前已大体准备就绪，即将开秤收购。
    江苏、山东已有80％以上轧花厂完成了机器检修。江苏省所有的轧花厂在收购新棉时期，还将推广快速轻轧法，以提高产量，按时完成轧花任务。对人力轧花车也本着“统筹兼顾、全面安排”的方针与农业社签订了加工合同。河南、江苏等省对于收购、包装用具和苫垫器材也做了充分准备。
    为了彻底了解农民的出售要求，以便制定符合国家和农民两利的采购方法，江苏省南通、射阳等三十个县曾进行了典型调查和试点工作，交流了各地试点经验。采购网的设置也尽量做到便利农民出售。
    今年全国共有一万八千多名棉花检验员、会计和保全工受到了训练，政治、业务水平有了提高。　　　　　　（张兴）
