Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 3rd: The third Damascus International Fair was declared open on the evening of September 1st by Syrian President Kuwatli. Thirty countries are participating in this year's fair.

The Director-General of the Fair, Kamil Roumani, pointed out in his speech that Syria has made tremendous achievements in all aspects of economic and cultural construction in the years since independence. Roumani pointed out that the fair is of great significance for bringing people of all countries closer together, exchanging experiences, and consolidating peace.

Subsequently, the Minister of National Economy, Khalil Kallas, also spoke. He pointed out that the Damascus Fair plays a huge role in developing equal and mutually beneficial trade and economic relations between countries. He then sharply criticized the policies pursued by imperialist countries, which try every possible means to hinder the economic development of Arab countries because they are very afraid that the development of the national economies of the Arab countries will guarantee the complete independence of these countries.

The Minister also condemned the policy of imperialist countries to exert economic and military pressure on Egypt after the nationalization of the Suez Canal. He said that imperialism continues to threaten armed intervention in the internal affairs of Arab countries to thwart their revitalization. However, the colonial era has passed and will never return.

After the opening ceremony, visits to the exhibition halls began. Guests were very interested in visiting the various exhibits in the Chinese Pavilion.

The Chinese Pavilion is one of the largest pavilions in this year's fair. More than 3,600 exhibits are displayed in the palatial building, of which heavy industrial products account for a large part of the total area of the pavilion. What attracts the audience most are the brand-new machines, the No. 7 furnace, the heavy rolling mill, the model of the Yellow River control plan, the gorgeous silk and exquisite handicrafts. This is China's first participation in the Damascus International Fair since the establishment of diplomatic relations with Syria.

    据新华社大马士革3日电　第三届大马士革国际博览会9月1日晚由叙利亚总统库阿特利宣布开幕。参加这次博览会的有三十个国家。
    博览会总干事卡米尔·鲁迈尼在讲话中指出，叙利亚在独立以后的年代里在经济和文化建设的各个方面都取得了巨大的成就，鲁迈尼指出，博览会对各国人民的接近、交流经验和巩固和平有着巨大意义。
    随后国民经济部长哈利尔·卡拉斯也讲了话。他指出，大马士革博览会对发展各国之间的平等互利的贸易关系和经济关系起着巨大的作用，接着他尖锐地指责帝国主义国家所实行的政策，这些国家千方百计阻碍阿拉伯国家经济的发展，因为它们非常害怕阿拉伯国家的国民经济的发展将会保障这些国家的完全独立。
    这位部长还谴责帝国主义国家在苏彝士运河国有化之后对埃及施加经济和军事上的压力的政策。他说，帝国主义继续威胁要武装干涉阿拉伯国家的内政，以阻挠它们的复兴。可是，殖民主义时代已经过去了，而且是一去不复返了。
    在举行开幕式之后，开始参观各陈列馆。客人们十分感兴趣地参观了中国馆的各种展览品。
    中国馆是这届博览会最大的馆之一。在宫殿式的建筑里展出了三千六百多种展品，其中重工业产品占馆内总面积的很大一部分。最吸引观众的是全新的机器，第七号熔炉、重型轧钢厂、治理黄河计划的模型，华丽的丝和精致的手工业品。这一次是中国在和叙利亚建立了外交关系以后第一次参加在大马士革举行的国际博览会。
