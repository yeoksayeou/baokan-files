　　The "Flower-Stern Ferry" Then and Now
　　Xinhua

　　A type of passenger and cargo ship sailing on the Pearl River is called the "Flower-Stern Ferry." This is a cargo barge that must be towed by a tugboat. The bow is square and flat, sloping downwards, while the stern is raised very high and painted with floral patterns, which, together with the glass windows, makes it particularly beautiful. "Du" in southern dialect probably means boat, so this type of ship is called "Flower-Stern Ferry" instead of a passenger and cargo barge.

　　The "Flower-Stern Ferry" has been developing on the Pearl River for about twenty or thirty years. The person who designed this type of boat initially did so based on the characteristics of the Pearl River and the convenience of business management. This type of boat is very stable when moving, without vibrations or the noise of machinery, so passengers feel very comfortable. Because the stern is raised high, it is easy for people to look at the scenery on both sides of the Pearl River, and the floral patterns on the hull complement the posture of the people sitting and watching, making them feel like they are in a painting. Especially when the sun rises and sets, the霞光 reflects on the water, creating a sense of "autumn water and long sky in one color"; therefore, people still remember the beauty and comfort of the Flower-Stern Ferry and have not forgotten it to this day.

　　This time I took the Flower-Stern Ferry for two days and nights, traveling seven hundred and eighteen kilometers, and I felt that the Flower-Stern Ferry is no longer what it used to be. Almost all of the past advantages have been replaced by troubles. First of all, chickens, ducks, pigs, cattle, snakes, and people are on the same boat, and the passenger and cargo cabins are only a short distance apart. The noise of the animals is chaotic and the smell is unpleasant. Secondly, sleeping is not comfortable. The bunks are too narrow. Each bunk is only seventy centimeters wide, marked by a partition on the sleeping platform. If a person is a little fat, they will "cross the border" when they turn over, which can easily lead to disputes. The bunks are made of wooden planks, and the pillows are made of ceramic tiles, short and hard. It is not easy to rent bedding on the boat, and the night is cold and windy, so even if you curl up to sleep, you cannot avoid being chilled. As for the food on the boat, it is not good, and there are no tables, so you have to eat half-lying on the bunk. If a person is a little taller, they will hit their head if they look up.

　　Why has the well-known Flower-Stern Ferry become like this today? It turns out that the Pearl River Navigation Bureau has a "重視貨運、輕視客運" (emphasize freight, de-emphasize passenger transport) mentality. For a long time, it has not equipped itself with full-time cadres to manage passenger transport. It has only recently equipped one person who knows little about the situation below and does not go down to inspect passenger transport work or listen to passengers' opinions. Therefore, some problems that are easy to solve, such as hard bunks, lack of bedding, and poor food, have not been solved. In fact, as long as a little equipment is added and management is improved, the Flower-Stern Ferry can restore its past reputation.

    “花尾渡”的今昔
    新华
    在珠江里航行着的一种客、货船，人们称它为花尾渡。这是一种必须用拖轮拖带的客货驳船，船头方而扁，往下倾，船尾翘得很高，还油漆着花卉图案，加上玻璃窗的衬托，显得特别美观。“渡”在南方话里可能是船的意思，所以这种船不叫客货驳而称花尾渡。
    花尾渡这种船，在珠江的发展历史，大约有二、三十年了。当初设计这种船型的人，是按照珠江的特点和经营管理上的方便而设计的。这种船走起来很稳，没有震荡和机器干扰的声音，所以坐船的人感到很舒适。因为船尾部翘得高，便于人们了望珠江两岸的风景，油漆着花纹的船身，衬托着人们的坐望姿态，真如身入画图中。特别是当日出日没之时，霞光映照在水面上，真有“秋水共长天一色”之感；所以人们对花尾渡的美观、舒适，记忆犹存，至今难忘。
    我这次坐了两昼夜的花尾渡，航行了七百十八公里，感到花尾渡已非往昔可比，过去的一些好处几乎都被烦恼代替了。首先鸡、鸭、猪、牛、蛇和人同船，客货舱相隔咫尺，叫声嘈杂，臭气难闻。其次，睡觉不舒适，睡铺太窄，通铺隔板为记，每人的铺位宽仅七十公分，身体胖点的人一翻身就会“越界”，容易发生纠纷。睡铺是木板的，枕头是磁砖的，又短又硬，船上又不容易租到卧具，夜寒风大，即便是蜷缩着身子睡觉，也不免寒气袭人。至于船上伙食更不见佳，又无餐桌，只好半卧在铺上就食。个子稍高的人一抬头就会碰痛脑袋。
    为什么闻名已久的花尾渡今天却变成这个样子呢？原来珠江航运局存在着重货轻客思想，长期以来没有配备管理客运的专职干部，最近才配备了一个人，对下边情况既少了解，又不下去检查客运工作，听取听取旅客意见，所以有些很容易解决的问题，如睡铺硬、卧具少、伙食不好等问题，却一直得不到解决。其实，只要增加点设备，改善一下经营管理，花尾渡是能够恢复过去的信誉的。
