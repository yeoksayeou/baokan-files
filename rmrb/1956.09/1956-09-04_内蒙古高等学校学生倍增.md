Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot: Higher education institutions in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region began their new semester on September 1st. The number of students of all ethnic groups entering schools this new academic year has increased from over 1,100 last year to over 2,500. Among them, nearly 700 are students from seven ethnic minorities, including Mongolian, Manchu, Hui, Korean, Daur, and Solon, more than triple the number of minority students enrolled in the previous semester.

The Inner Mongolia Medical College, newly built this year, also officially opened on the 1st. More than 250 students from all ethnic groups and more than 40 Han teachers from Beijing and other places celebrated the opening ceremony together.

The Inner Mongolia College of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine revised its teaching plan before the start of the semester to reduce the burden of excessive study time for students, reducing class time from 33 hours per week to below 29 hours, in order to better cultivate students' ability to think independently.

The Inner Mongolia Normal College, which is about to open, has established undergraduate programs in the Department of Chinese Language and Literature and the Department of Education at the beginning of this new academic year. A large-scale expansion was carried out before the start of the semester, allowing the student population to quickly increase to more than 1,800.

    内蒙古高等学校学生倍增
    据新华社呼和浩特讯　内蒙古自治区各高等学校9月1日起陆续开学。在这个新学年进学校学习的各个民族的学生，由去年一千一百多名增加到两千五百多名，其中蒙古、满、回、朝鲜、达呼尔和索伦等七个少数民族的学生近七百名，比今年上学期在校的少数民族学生人数增加了两倍多。
    今年兴建的内蒙古医学院1日也正式开学了，二百五十多名各民族学生和从北京等地来的四十多名汉族教师一起欢庆了开学典礼。
    内蒙古畜牧兽医学院为了减轻学生学习时间过多的负担，开学前重新修正了教学计划，由原来每周上课三十三小时缩减到二十九小时以下，以便更好地培养学生们的独立思考能力。
    即将开学的内蒙古师范学院，在今年新学年开始又成立了本科，有中国语文系和教学系。开学前进行了大规模的扩建，使学生人数很快就增加到一千八百多名。
