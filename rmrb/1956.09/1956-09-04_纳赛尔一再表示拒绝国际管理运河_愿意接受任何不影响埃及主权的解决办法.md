Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 3rd: Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser said on September 2nd regarding the Suez Canal issue, "I am willing to accept any solution that does not affect our sovereignty, but Egypt cannot accept international control."

Nasser said to a group of American and British journalists in a televised interview on the eve of his meeting with the "Five-Nation Committee" delegation that his meeting with the chairman of the "Five-Nation Committee," Menzies, was "not a negotiation, but merely a discussion." "The initiative is in their hands, not mine. I am just listening."

Nasser repeatedly rejected suggestions for "international control" of the Suez Canal at the press conference. He said, "Egypt cannot accept international control. International control means collective colonialism." He pointed out that the International Suez Canal Company was a remnant of colonialism, a state within a state. "We feel that international control would mean a loss of part of our sovereignty."

When asked if he intended to sign an agreement guaranteeing the rights of countries using the Suez Canal, Nasser said, "I have already agreed to negotiate any new agreement guaranteeing freedom of navigation based on the 1888 Convention. This proposal is still valid."

When asked if he was willing to go to war to protect his position on the canal issue, Nasser replied, "Yes, if attacked."

Nasser said, "I am not a person who is threatening the world; I am a person who is facing threats. We are facing the threat of war from two major powers. All we can do is defend our country. We hope to find a solution, and we feel that a solution must be found through negotiation."

He stated that he would not submit the Suez Canal issue to the United Nations because he feared that the major powers would use their veto power. He said, "We are always very disappointed with the United Nations General Assembly. We would rather rely on the moral strength of the public and public opinion."

Nasser said that Eisenhower's statement on August 31st clarified the United States' position on the Suez Canal. He said, "This statement acknowledges that the canal belongs to Egypt, and the only issue is the issue of freedom of navigation."

Nasser said, "It seems that what Eisenhower wants is exactly what we are offering." He recalled that President Eisenhower, in his statement on August 29th, had mentioned the 1888 Convention stipulating the internationalization of the Suez Canal. Nasser said, "We opposed this statement. Later, President Eisenhower issued a second statement, which showed that, broadly speaking, his views were the same as Egypt's."

One journalist pointed out that Eisenhower had said he hoped Nasser would accept the Dulles Plan, which stipulated international control of the canal. Nasser said that he and Eisenhower "may have some differences in the practical application of our views."

    纳赛尔一再表示拒绝国际管理运河
    愿意接受任何不影响埃及主权的解决办法
    新华社3日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔9月2日说，关于苏彝士运河问题，“我愿意接受任何不会影响我们主权的解决办法，但是埃及不能接受国际管理”。
    纳赛尔在同“五国委员会”代表团举行会谈前夕对一批美英记者发表电视谈话的时候说，他同“五国委员会”主席孟席斯的会谈并“不是谈判，而仅仅是讨论”。“主动是在他们手里而不是在我手里，我只是听听”。
    纳赛尔在记者招待会上一次又一次地表示拒绝关于“国际管理”苏彝士运河的建议。他说，“埃及不能接受国际管理，国际管理意味着集体殖民主义”。他指出，国际苏彝士运河公司是殖民主义的残余，是一个国家中的国家。“我们觉得国际管理将使我们损失一部分主权”。
    有记者问，他是否打算签订一项保证使用苏彝士运河的国家的权利的协定。纳赛尔说，“我已经答应根据1888年公约谈判保证航行自由的任何新的协定。这个建议现在仍然有效”。
    有记者问，他是否愿意为了保护他在运河问题上的立场而进行战争。纳赛尔回答说：“是的。如果受到攻击的话。”
    纳赛尔说，我不是一个正在威胁着世界的人，我是一个面临着威胁的人。我们面临着来自两个大国的战争威胁。我们所能做的一切就是保卫我们的国家。我们希望求得解决，而我们觉得必须通过谈判求得解决。
    他表示，他不会把苏彝士运河问题提交联合国，因为他担心那些大国会使用否决权。他说：“我们对联合国大会总是感到很失望。我们宁愿依靠公众的道义力量和舆论”。
    纳赛尔说，艾森豪威尔8月31日发表的声明澄清了美国对苏彝士运河的意见；他说，“这篇声明承认运河是属于埃及的，唯一的问题只是航行自由的问题”。
    纳赛尔说，“看来艾森豪威尔希望的正是我们提供的”。他追述说，艾森豪威尔总统在8月29日发表的声明里曾经提到1888年公约规定苏彝士运河国际化。纳赛尔说，“我们反对这个声明，后来艾森豪威尔总统发表第二次声明，这个声明表明，大体上，他的观点同埃及的一样。”
    有一个记者指出，艾森豪威尔曾经说，他希望纳赛尔接受规定国际管理运河的杜勒斯计划。纳赛尔说，他和艾森豪威尔“可能在我们的意见的实践方面有所分歧”。
