    驻福建前线部队
    抢救遭受水灾居民
    据新华社福建前线21日电　中国人民解放军驻福建各部队大力抢救遭受水灾的沿海人民。
    福建各地受到台风侵袭，连日大雨，山洪暴发，沿海不少地区发生水灾。驻在受洪水侵袭地区的各部队官兵已经紧急动员起来参加抢救工作。18日夜，当洪水侵入同安县城的时候，驻厦门地区的部队立即派出一千多个官兵，调集一百三十多条机帆船、登陆艇、渔船、舢板等船只，在某部参谋长彭飞大校指挥下冒雨进入受灾地区；驻漳州地区的部队也用汽车、载运船只赶到同安县城。在部队官兵和当地党政机关的协同抢救下，一万多个受洪水威胁的居民已安全转移。
    20日，各地的洪水都开始降落。官兵们仍在继续进行抢救中。
