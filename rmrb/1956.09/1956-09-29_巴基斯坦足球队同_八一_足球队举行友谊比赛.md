    Pakistan Football Team Plays Friendly Match with "August 1st" Football Team

    (Our newspaper reports) The Pakistan national football team played a friendly match with the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" football team at the Beijing Xian Nong Tan Stadium on the afternoon of the 28th. As a result of the match, the "August 1st" team won with a score of 1-0.

    The match began at the feet of Xing Guifu, the center forward of the "August 1st" team, and the whole team immediately launched an active and rapid attack. The tactic adopted by the "August 1st" team was a four-forward system with the center forward playing slightly behind, making more use of the gap in the middle of the Pakistani team's penalty area to break through the opponent's defense. The Pakistani team's style of play was a three-forward and two-back system, with most of their attacks involving passing the ball to the wings, and then crossing, with more headers on goal from the front. Shortly after the kick-off, the "August 1st" team used short passes to approach the opponent's goal three times, but they were all forced into corner kicks by the Pakistani team's defenders. At twelve minutes, right inside forward Chen Keliang received a pass from right winger Pan Peigen and slammed it into the net, opening the score. After losing a goal, the Pakistani team made every effort to organize a counter-attack. The backs also moved forward to intercept and cheer in the midfield, and the two forwards became more active, especially left winger Musa, whose superb skills were considered the most difficult to deal with in the Pakistani team. The "August 1st" team, facing a strong enemy, relied more on the wit and bravery of defenders Chen Fulai, Gao Junshi, and goalkeeper Huang Zhaowen to save many dangerous balls, allowing them to turn danger into safety.

    In the second half, due to the greater physical exertion of both teams, although there were attacks from both sides, none were effective, and the score remained at 1-0 until the end of the match.

    Before the start of the match, He Long, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Physical Culture and Sports Commission, met with Mu. Saeed, the leader of the Pakistani team, and A. Mirza, the deputy leader. After the end of the match, Cai Tingkai, Deputy Director of the Physical Culture and Sports Commission, and Ahmed, the Pakistani Ambassador to China, went to the stadium to shake hands with the players from both sides one by one, expressing their regards.

    巴基斯坦足球队同“八一”足球队举行友谊比赛
    本报讯　巴基斯坦国家足球队28日下午同中国人民解放军“八一”足球队在北京先农坛球场举行友谊赛。比赛结果，“八一”队以一比零获胜。
    比赛在“八一”队中锋邢桂福脚下开始，随即全队展开积极主动和快速的进攻。“八一”队采用的战术是中锋靠后的四前锋制，多利用巴基斯坦队禁区中间空隙，突破对方防线。巴基斯坦队的打法是三前锋和两后卫式的，进攻多半是得球递给两翼，再传中，由正面头球顶门较多。开球后不久，“八一”队运用短传，曾三度迫近对方球门，但是都被巴基斯坦队后卫逼成角球。十二分钟时，右内锋陈克亮得右边锋潘培根传来的球，猛扣入网，首开纪录。巴基斯坦队失球后全力组织反攻，后卫也驱前在中场拦截和助威，两锋更显得活跃，特别是左边锋穆萨球艺超人，被认为巴基斯坦队中最难对付的人。“八一”队在强敌临门的情况下，多靠后卫陈复赉、高筠时和守门员黄肇文的机智骁勇，救出不少险球，得以转危为安。
    下半场由于双方队员体力消耗较多，虽互有攻击，但均未奏效，比分以一比零直到终场。
    国务院副总理、体育运动委员会主任贺龙在比赛开始以前接见了巴基斯坦队领队穆·赛义德和副领队阿·米尔札。比赛结束以后，体育运动委员会副主任蔡廷锴和巴基斯坦驻中国大使阿哈默德等到球场上同双方队员一一握手，表示慰问。
