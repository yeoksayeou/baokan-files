The early rice of the Jianshe Agricultural Cooperative in Xishui County, Hubei Province, has been harvested, and a bumper harvest of middle rice and cotton is in sight. The total value of the cooperative's agricultural and sideline production this year is expected to increase by about 70% compared to last year. The Party branch committee and cooperative cadres said excitedly: "The advanced cooperative has fired its first shot!" They believe that with grain in hand, there's no need to worry about cooking; guaranteeing a 90% increase in income for the members is no problem. However, the members felt that increased production does not necessarily mean an increase in actual income. They all knew that this year's production investment was large, non-productive labor was high, and the loans owed to the state were considerable; they were afraid that not much would be distributed after deducting these items.

When they started formulating the autumn harvest distribution plan, the cadres were blindly optimistic and did not pay attention to these complex issues. Some advocated deducting as little as possible, such as the public accumulation fund, which was originally planned to retain only 3% of the total income; later, after calculating the accounts, they realized that the money already spent was more than this figure, so they had to retain more. Some, simply to avoid the difficulty and trouble of asking members for money, proposed to repay all loans and deduct more production costs. Doing so would reduce the income of the members. In this exploration, everyone increasingly realized that if the economic relationship between the state, the agricultural cooperative, and the members could not be correctly handled, it might affect the cooperative's production needs, affect the due support for national construction, or prevent the members from increasing their income. Therefore, they paid special attention to studying and handling the relationship between these three aspects in the work of formulating the autumn harvest distribution plan.

The economic relationship between the agricultural cooperative and the state is mainly reflected in the payment of agricultural tax, the sale of surplus grain, the repayment of advance grain and cotton purchase payments, credit sales payments, and various loans. After discussion, the members and cooperative cadres unanimously believed that since production had increased this year, the first three items could be handled completely in accordance with policies and contracts, and the credit purchases of fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, and agricultural implements could be fully repaid. The basic construction loan was tentatively set to be repaid by one-third, and the production loan and small-scale water conservancy loan were tentatively set to be repaid by one-half; after the other accounts were calculated, they would be revised with reference to them.

The economic relationship between the cooperative and the members is mainly reflected in the cooperative's retention of various expenses and the clearing of surpluses and deficits of goods and cash between the two parties.

The agricultural cooperative owed the members: 345 yuan that the members should have received but did not receive during the original elementary cooperative stage, 600 yuan owed for the purchase of fertilizer, and more than 1,000 yuan for other deposits, investments, and piglets, ducklings, fish fry, sugarcane seedlings, and trees sold to the cooperative. The members owed the cooperative: more than 3,800 yuan in production share funds, and 280 yuan in overspending and arrears for some households during the elementary cooperative stage. Some cadres advocated deducting all the money owed by the members to the cooperative indiscriminately. After discussion, everyone believed that the money owed by the cooperative to the members was mostly used for production investment, and now that production has increased, it should all be repaid. As for the money owed by the members to the cooperative, it should be handled specifically on a household-by-household basis. How should the various expenses be deducted? According to the actual situation, it is not difficult to determine the agricultural tax and administrative management fees; the retention of the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund, after discussion, the principle stipulates: implement the plan of running the cooperative diligently and frugally, so that it is enough and has a little accumulation. The deduction of production costs, which has the largest proportion of expenses and involves the most problems, became the special focus of the Party branch, management committee, and distribution committee cadres. The total actual agricultural production investment of the cooperative this year needs more than 8,800 yuan, accounting for about 7.7% of the total income. First, it must be decided: should it be deducted from the total income according to this year's actual expenditure? Or should it be deducted according to how much production investment will be needed next year? After discussion, everyone believed that it would not be good to leave too much in the first year of the cooperative's establishment, so deduct it according to this year's. In principle, this year's production costs should be paid from the share funds contributed by the members, so that the production investment for the next year can be guaranteed. The cooperative originally stipulated that more than 7,900 yuan of production share funds should be contributed, but more than 3,800 yuan had not been paid. Therefore, the production costs deducted this year are actually those that have already been spent, and more than half of this money was advanced from loans, credit sales, and sideline income; after repaying this money from the production costs deducted this year, only the original four thousand yuan or so of share funds remain. However, the seeds and public feed that must be retained in the next year are worth more than 3,900 yuan. After offsetting, there will be no production funds this winter and next spring. This raises two questions:

First, the originally allocated production share funds were about 1,000 yuan less than this year's practical production costs. Is it necessary to reallocate this money? Everyone believes that the original amount allocated was already large, and it cannot be reallocated, which would be particularly unfavorable to the poor peasant members.

Second, what should be done with the more than 3,800 yuan of production shares owed by the members? It was unanimously agreed that it should all be paid, otherwise, where would the next year's crops come from? After careful research, the problem is not so simple. Some households really cannot afford to pay, and some middle peasants also asked to use the surplus funds from cattle and agricultural implements (the portion of the public ownership share fund that was overpaid) to offset the production share funds.

After conducting a thorough household-by-household analysis, the principles and methods for collecting the share funds were determined: some households in difficulty cannot afford to pay, and it is planned to request the state to allow 300 to 400 yuan to be taken from the 600 yuan production loan and transferred to a poor peasant cooperative fund loan (the rest will be repaid to the state) in order to mobilize other members to pay the share funds in full. A few households of poor peasant members who paid too much in share funds due to improper loans can transfer it to the difficult households that still owe share funds. The middle peasant members owe the most production shares, and the surplus portion of the public ownership shares they are entitled to is also the largest. Based on this year's income, the production shares can generally be paid in full, but they want to use all the money from the cattle and agricultural implements to offset. When the cattle and agricultural implements were priced and entered into the cooperative, it was agreed that in addition to paying the public ownership share fund, the surplus would be repaid in installments, so it was decided to repay one-third this year and allow it to offset the production share funds. This is beneficial to both the cooperative and the members. Not doing so would make it more difficult for the cooperative to raise production funds for the next year. According to these methods, it is estimated that about 3,000 yuan of production shares can be collected, which will basically be enough for the first half of next year; as for the portion of production costs that is not enough next year (estimated at about 300 yuan), it can be solved from sideline income and mobilizing members to invest, etc. If production increases again next year, it may be possible to retain enough production investment for one year.

After repeated accounting by cooperative cadres and members at all levels, democratic discussion and revision, it was finally determined that the total retention for various items next year will account for 25.21% of the total income, and 74.79% of the income can be directly distributed to the members.

When specifically handling the relationship between members and the cooperative and the state, the first problem encountered was: members blindly demanded to improve their lives, pitting their personal interests against the interests of the cooperative and the state. Poor peasants demanded to eat better, dress warmer, and live in better houses; middle peasants demanded to eat more fish and meat, and observed the poor peasants. Poor peasant member Li Duzhang, a family of five, had an average income of only 43.6 yuan per person last year, but this year it is 57 yuan per person, and he still says it is not enough. Another member, Li Duzhang, reflected: "I just want to take back the rations and buy some clothes, I didn't plan to pay back the debt." Some members, due to excessive debt, affected their labor enthusiasm. Like poor peasant member Cai Yunfeng, who owes 270 yuan, he said: "Doing more is not enough to pay off the debt, it's enough to get the rations back, you can't let me starve."

Based on this situation, each team universally calculated income comparison accounts and life improvement accounts, so that the members realized that the superiority of the advanced cooperative and the state's loan support were inseparable from increasing their income and improving their lives, thereby realizing the consistency of developing production and improving life. Educated the members not to compare their lives with others, but to make their own calculations, and comprehensively arrange their lives according to their due income. In the discussion, the principle that life should be improved more than last year after repaying loans and debts was affirmed first. On this basis, everyone made their own calculations, planned their lives, and fully deliberated, negotiated, and self-reported public agreement, which the members were very satisfied with. The members unanimously believed that the overspending last year and this year's production shares should be repaid as much as possible, and state loans and credit cooperative loans should also be repaid in part. Member Li Duqi said: "If we don't allocate production costs, next year's production will have no foundation; credit cooperatives and bank loans are circulating money, and some should also be repaid. If no one repays, how can we solve problems if we have difficulties again?" After such in-depth ideological mobilization, the members widely conducted family consultations, field conversations, found confidants to calculate accounts, planned their lives, and self-reported the amount of various loans to be repaid this year.

The result of household-by-household self-calculation and self-reporting: on the basis of ensuring that members increase their actual income and improve their lives, the overspending of members last year can be fully recovered. For production shares, 92.3% of households can pay 90%, and only 7.7% of households, accounting for 18% of the amount, need to request the transfer of state production loans to poor peasant cooperative fund loans for full payment. 70% of credit cooperative loans can be recovered, 40% of state loans can be recovered, 20% of poor peasant fund loans can be recovered, and more than 60% of private debts can also be cleared. From a class perspective, the debts of new and old upper-middle peasants can basically be repaid, most of the new and old lower-middle peasants can repay 70%, and the poor peasants can repay 30%. In this way, except for one poor peasant whose income per person is 47 yuan after repaying part of the debt, the general income per person is above 55 yuan.

After determining this on a household-by-household basis, the indebted households were relieved, and the non-indebted households were also very satisfied, feeling that they would not enter "empty accounts" this year. In this way, the policy of distribution according to labor was further implemented; at the same time, the absolute egalitarianism of some members was overcome; and they began to learn to make annual plans and arrange their lives in a planned way. After specifically defining the relationship between the interests of the state, the cooperative, and the members down to the household, it encouraged the members to further improve production and improve their lives. The members universally demanded to improve their family sideline businesses. Nineteen households in the tenth team planned to privately raise fourteen pigs, and the members of the eleventh team had already automatically gone outside to buy back four. The members actively put forward rationalization proposals to the cooperative, requesting the cooperative to draw more people in the autumn to engage in sideline businesses and expand the cooperative's income from all aspects. The members also actively strived to complete the self-reported workdays, and some automatically ran to engage in sideline businesses, and the enthusiasm for labor was further heightened.

    在制定秋收分配方案中正确处理国家、农业社和社员三方面的关系
    肖良恺　姚绍崇
    湖北省浠水县建设农业合作社的早稻已经收割到手，中稻和棉花丰收在望。全社预计今年的农业副业总产值将比去年增加约70％。党支委和社干部都兴奋地说：“高级社的第一炮打响了！”他们认为：有米不愁做不了饭，保证90％的社员增加收入不成问题。但是，社员却觉得：增了产不一定能增加实际收入。他们都知道今年的生产投资很大，非生产用工很多，欠国家的贷款也不少，恐怕扣除了这些以后分不到多少。
    开始制定秋收分配方案的时候，干部们盲目乐观，并没有注意到这些复杂的问题。有的主张扣的越少越好，如公积金原议定只留总收入的3％；后来一算账，才知已开支的钱还要比这个数字大，只好又多留。有的单纯为了避免向社员要钱为难和减少麻烦，提议要还清所有的贷款，要多扣生产费用。这样做，又会减少社员的收入。在这样的摸索中，大家越来越清楚地感觉到：如果不能正确处理国家、农业合作社和社员三方面的经济关系，就可能影响合作社的生产需要，影响对国家建设应有的支援，或者使社员不能增加收入。因此，他们在制定秋收分配方案的工作中，特别认真地研究和处理了这三方面的关系问题。
    农业合作社和国家的经济关系，主要表现在交纳公粮、出售余粮、偿还粮棉预购款、赊销款和各种贷款等方面。经过讨论，社员和社干部一致认为：今年增了产，对前三项可以完全按政策和合同办理，赊购的肥料、种子、农药、农具款可以全部还清。基本建设贷款暂定还三分之一，生产贷款和小型水利贷款暂定还二分之一；待其他的账都算出来后，再参照修改。
    合作社和社员的经济关系，主要表现在合作社对于各项开支的扣留上和双方对实物和现款余欠的清理上。
    农业社欠社员的有：原来初级社时的社员应得未得的钱三百四十五元，收购肥料欠款六百元，其他存款、投资、卖给社的小猪、小鸭、鱼秧、甘蔗秧、树木共千余元。社员欠社的有：生产股份基金三千八百多元，一部分户初级社时超支、欠款二百八十元，有的干部主张社员欠社的钱不分清红皂白通通照扣，讨论以后，大家认为：社欠社员的钱，多是用作生产投资了，现在生产增加了，应当一律还清，至于社员欠社的款，应当逐户具体处理。各项开支怎样扣除呢？公粮和行政管理费，根据实际情况，不难确定；公积金、公益金的扣留，经过讨论，原则规定：贯彻勤俭办社方案，做到够用并且稍有积累。开支比例最大、涉及问题最多的是生产费用的扣留。因此，党支部和管委会以及分配委员会的干部，特别集中精力研究了这个问题。全社今年农业生产投资实际需用八千八百多元，约占总收入的7.7％。首先必须决定：在总收入中，按照今年实际开支扣除呢？还是按照明年需要多少生产投资扣除呢？经讨论后，都认为建社头一年留的太多不行，就照今年的扣除。按说今年的生产费用应由社员摊出的股份基金开支，这样扣除后才能保证下年度的生产投资有着落。全社原规定摊生产股份基金七千九百多元，但还有三千八百多元没有交出来。因此，今年扣除的生产费用，实际上是已经开支了的，而这些钱有半数以上是从贷款、赊销、副业收入中垫付的；从今年扣除的生产费用中把这些钱一还，所余的仅有原来摊出的四千多元股份基金了。可是，在下年度必须留的种子和公共饲料就值三千九百多元。抵交以后，今冬明春就没有生产资金了。这就发生了两个问题：
    第一，原来摊的生产股份基金比今年实用生产费用少了约一千元，是否需要重摊这笔钱？大家认为原来摊的数目就不少，不能再摊，再摊特别对贫农社员不利。
    第二，社员下欠的三千八百多元生产股金怎么办？一致认为应当一律交清，不然下年的庄稼本从那里来？仔细一研究，问题也不这么简单。有些户确实交不起，有些中农还要求用多余的耕牛、农具款（交公有化股份基金多的部分）抵交生产股金。
    经过逐户摸底具体分析以后，才确定了清收股份基金的原则和办法：部分困难户交不起，打算请求国家允许从六百元生产贷款中，拿出三百到四百元转作贫农合作基金贷款（其余偿还国家），以利于动员其他社员交齐股金。贫农社员中的少数户因为贷款不当股金交多了，可以转给尚欠股金的困难户。中农社员欠生产股金最多，应得的公有化股金多余部分也最多，根据今年收入，生产股金一般都能交齐，但他们想把耕牛、农具钱全部抵交。耕牛、农具作价入社时，议定除交公有化股份基金，多余的部分分年偿还，因此，决定今年先还三分之一，并允许抵交生产股金。这样对于社和社员都有利。不这样做，就会使社里筹措下年生产资金困难更多。照这些办法执行，预计可能收起三千元左右的生产股金，下年度上半年基本上可以够用；至于下年度不够的部分生产费用（约计三百多元），可以从副业收入和发动社员投资等方面解决。明年再增产，就可能留足一年生产投资了。
    经过社干部和社员层层反复算账，民主讨论修正，最后确定：下年各项扣留共占总收入的25.21％，74.79％的收入可以直接分给社员。
    具体处理社员和社和国家关系的时候，首先碰到的问题是：社员盲目要求改善生活，把个人利益同社同国家利益对立起来。贫农要求吃饱点、穿暖点、住好点；中农更要求多吃点鱼，多吃点肉，并且观望贫农。贫农社员李笃章，五口人，去年每人平均只有四十三元六角的收入，而今年每人平均五十七元，还说不够用。又如社员李笃章反映：“只想拿回口粮，穿点衣服，就没打算还账。”还有些社员，由于负债过多，而影响到劳动情绪。像贫农社员蔡云凤，欠二百七十元的债，他说：“做多了也是不够还债，拿得回口粮就可以了，总不能叫我饿着。”
    根据这一情况，各队普遍算了收入对比账和生活改善账，使社员认识到高级社的优越性和国家的贷款扶持对自己增加收入、改善生活是分不开的，从而认识到发展生产和改善生活的一致性。教育社员不要和别人比生活，而要各打各的算盘，根据自己应有的收入全面地安排自己的生活。讨论中，首先肯定了还贷款还债后生活比去年还要有所改善的原则。在这个基础上，各打算盘，计划生活，充分酝酿、协商，自报公议定案，社员十分满意。社员一致认为：去年超支和今年的生产股金要尽可能还清，国家贷款和信用社借款也要还一部分。社员李笃启说：“不摊生产费，明年的生产就没有着落；信用社和银行贷款，是个流动钱，也应当还些，谁都不还，再有困难怎样解决？”经过这样深入的思想发动以后，社员广泛地进行了家庭协商，田头交谈，找知心人算账，计划生活，自报了今年偿还各项贷款的数目。
    逐户自算自报的结果：在保证社员增加实际收入，改善生活的基础上，去年社员超支的可以全部收起来。生产股金，有92.3％的户可以交纳90％，只有7.7％的户，占金额18％，需要请求用国家生产贷款转作贫农合作基金贷款付清。信用社借款，可收起70％，国家贷款可收回40％，贫农基金贷款可收回20％，私债也可清理60％多。从阶层看，新老上中农的债务基本上可以偿清，新老下中农大部分可偿还70％，贫农可偿还30％。这样，除了一户贫农还部分债后每人收入四十七元以外，一般每人收入都在五十五元以上。
    这样逐户定下来以后，欠债户安了心，不欠债户也十分满意，感到今年不会进“空账”。这样，进一步地贯彻了按劳取酬的政策；同时，克服了部分社员的绝对平均主义思想；并且开始学会作全年打算，有计划地安排自己的生活。把国家和社和社员利益关系具体确定到户以后，鼓励了社员进一步搞好生产、改善生活的要求。社员普遍要求搞好自己的家庭副业。十队十九户社员，计划私人养十四头猪，十一队的社员已经自动地到外面去买回四头。社员们积极地向社里提出了合理化建议，要求社里在秋季再多抽几个人去搞副业，从各方面扩大社里的收入。社员并且积极主动地争取完成自报的劳动日，有的自动地跑去搞副业，劳动热情进一步地高涨起来。
