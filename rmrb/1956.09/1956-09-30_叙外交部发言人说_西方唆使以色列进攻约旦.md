Xinhua News Agency, 28th. Damascus Dispatch: A spokesman for the Syrian Foreign Ministry said at a press conference on September 27th that the West is inciting Israel to attack Arab countries in order to "fish in troubled waters."

He said that Western countries "have built Israel into their base," and therefore they are responsible for Israel's attack on Jordanian troops.

The spokesman also said that it is difficult for the Arab people to believe that Israel's attack was not manipulated behind the scenes by imperialist countries. He said that these attacks "have angered the entire Arab world and aroused anti-Western sentiment."

    叙外交部发言人说
    西方唆使以色列进攻约旦
    新华社28日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚外交部的一位发言人9月27日在记者招待会上说，西方正在唆使以色列攻击阿拉伯国家，以便“浑水摸鱼”。
    他说，西方国家“把以色列建成为它们的基地”，因此，它们要对以色列进攻约旦军队一事负责。
    这位发言人还说，阿拉伯人民很难相信以色列的进攻不是帝国主义国家在背后操纵的。他说，这些进攻“激怒了整个阿拉伯世界，并且激起了反对西方人的情绪”。
