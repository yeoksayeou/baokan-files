Xinhua News Agency, September 9th. Kyodo News reported today that the Japanese government has decided to substantially revise its current trade policy toward China. Based on observations over a long period, the Japanese side "will place its emphasis on securing the mainland Chinese market."

Kyodo News said that the reason the Japanese government is adopting this approach is because Western European countries have recently significantly increased trade with China, and if Japan continues to trade with China as it has in the past, it will be rejected by the Chinese market.

The Japanese business delegation to China, which recently returned, recently submitted a report stating that Western European countries are already exporting embargoed goods to China. These Japanese business people are worried that if Japan does not break down the embargo barriers, it will lose the Chinese market in fierce trade competition. After the publication of this report, the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, the Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade, and the Japan-China Import and Export Association jointly strongly demanded on September 5th that the Japanese government strive to ease embargo restrictions and change the situation in which Japanese goods lag behind those of Western European countries in the Chinese market.

Kyodo News said that the Japanese government has begun to take necessary measures. It is negotiating with the U.S. government, requesting that Japan be allowed to conduct flexible export trade with China. According to Japanese government sources, Japan intends to ensure that, for a certain range of goods that require the understanding of the U.S. government before they can be exported to China, it will only submit reports to the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) after the export has taken place.

    共同社报道日政府打算修改对华贸易政策
    新华社9日讯　据共同社今天报道，日本政府已经决定要大规模修改现行的对中国的贸易政策。根据长时期的观察所得到的观点，日本方面“将把重点放在确保中国大陆市场上面”。
    共同社说，日本政府采取这个方针的原因是因为西欧国家最近对中国贸易有了相当增加，日本如果继续像过去那样同中国贸易，将会被中国市场所摒弃。
    不久以前回国的日本工商界访华代表团最近曾经提出一份报告，说明西欧国家已经在向中国输出禁运物资。这些日本工商界人士担心，日本如果不打破禁运壁垒，它将在激烈的贸易竞争下失去中国市场。在这个报告发表后，日本国际贸易促进协会、国会议员促进日中贸易联盟和日中输出入协会在9月5日共同强烈要求日本政府努力缓和禁运限制，改变日本商品在中国市场上比西欧国家落后的现象。
    共同社说，日本政府已经开始采取必要的措施。它正在同美国政府进行交涉，要求允许日本进行有伸缩性的对中国的出口贸易。据日本政府人士说，日本打算使那些需要取得美国政府的谅解才能向中国出口的物资中，有一定范围的物资今后只在输出后向巴黎统筹委员会提出报告。
