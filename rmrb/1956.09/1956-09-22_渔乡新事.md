	New Happenings in Fishing Villages
	New Telecommunications Lines in Fishing Ports
	Shacheng Port in Fuding County, which had never had telephone or telegraph service, has recently established new telecommunications lines. Now, the Shacheng Postal and Telecommunications Branch receives or sends many long-distance telephone calls and telegrams every day.

	Shacheng Port is an important fishing and commercial port on the northeastern coast of Fujian, with many merchant ships coming and going every day, and many aquatic products and goods are bought and sold here. In the past, if local merchant ships and fishing boats had urgent matters to contact with other places, they had to travel ninety miles to the county seat. With the establishment of new telecommunications lines, people can use telephones and telegrams to contact all parts of the country.
	New Residences for Waterborne Fishermen
	Fishermen of the Shui-shang Township in Longxi, Fujian, who have always lived on boats, are building new onshore residences with government assistance.

	The fishermen's residences under construction include twenty-six houses and an auditorium. The Longxi County People's Government has allocated 13,000 yuan for the construction of these residences.

	The fishermen of the Shui-shang Township live on boats all year round. After the new residences are completed, the fishermen and their families can move to the land to live, and no longer have to worry about the dangers of sea storms. The fishermen all consider this a great happy event.
	Transportation Vehicles on Islands
	In September, Pingtan Island, a coastal island in Fujian, began to operate mixed passenger and freight vehicles.

	Pingtan is an island close to Taiwan, with densely populated fishing ports. The famous Niushan fishing ground is located at the Guanyinwo estuary on the island. The island needs to transfer about 20,000 tons of grain, cooking oil, cloth, department stores, agricultural tools and other materials from the mainland every year. In the past, after these materials were transported to the island, they were all transported by carrying on shoulders, horse-drawn carts, and flatbed carts, and the transportation price was five to eight times higher than that of automobiles. Now that automobiles are available, transportation is not only convenient, but it is also convenient for people living in various estuaries to go to the city.

    渔乡新事
    渔港的电讯新线路
    从来不通电话、电报的福鼎县沙埕港，最近已经架设了新的电讯线路。现在，沙埕邮电支局每天都要收到或发出许多长途电话和电报。
    沙埕港是福建东北沿海的重要渔港和商港之一，每天都有许多商船来往，有许多渔产品和货物在这里购销。从前，当地的商船、渔船有急事要和外地联系，就要跑路到九十里以外的县城去。新的电讯线路架设以后，人们就可以利用电话、电报和全国各地联系。
    水上渔民的新住宅
    以船为家的福建龙溪水上乡渔民，正在政府援助下兴建新的陆上住宅。
    正在兴建中的渔民住宅包括二十六间住宅和一座礼堂。龙溪县人民政府为建筑这些住宅，拨款达一万三千元。
    水上乡渔民常年以船为家，新住宅建成以后，渔民和他们的家属们就可以搬到陆地居住，再也不必担心海上风浪的惊险了。渔民们都认为这是一件大喜事。
    海岛上的运输汽车
    福建前沿海岛平潭岛，在9月份开始通行客货混合汽车。
    平潭是距离台湾较近的海岛，岛上渔港密布，闻名的牛山渔场就在岛上的观音沃海口。岛上每年需要在内地调运的粮食、食油、布匹、百货、农具等各种物资约有两万吨左右。过去，这些物资运到岛上以后，全靠肩挑和马车、板车运送，运价比汽车要高出五倍到八倍。现在通了汽车，不但运输方便，住在各海口的人民到城关去也很便利。
