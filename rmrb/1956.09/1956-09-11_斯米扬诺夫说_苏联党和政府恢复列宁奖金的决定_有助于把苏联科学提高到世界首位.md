Xinhua News Agency, 10th. According to a TASS report: Academician ?斯米扬诺夫, Chairman of the Lenin Science and Technology Prize Committee, published an article in "Pravda" on September 9th, stating: The decision to restore the Lenin Prize demonstrates the constant concern of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government for the development of Soviet science, culture, and technology.

?斯米扬诺夫 pointed out that science and technology in many sectors of the Soviet Union have reached a new stage. The struggle to strive for the high development of Soviet science, technology, and production should be strengthened on all fronts. Elevating science and technology of decisive significance to the world's leading position is a great task, but also a very difficult one. Undoubtedly, the Lenin Prize will help achieve this goal.

As the Soviet Union is gradually transitioning to a communist society, the Soviet scientific community and the entire Soviet people are expecting Soviet social scientists to first make theoretical contributions to the laws governing the development of socialist society. Currently, the Soviet Union is resolutely overcoming the consequences of the cult of personality, which opens up broader prospects for social science workers.

?斯米扬诺夫 then wrote that, according to regulations, a broad discussion must be conducted on the list of prize recipients before the Lenin Prize is awarded. The list of prize recipients accepted for discussion by the Lenin Prize Committee will be published in newspapers, and extensive discussions will be conducted through various forms. The task of the committee is not only to correctly estimate the value of various inventions and works, but also to assist the Party and the government in correctly estimating the development prospects of newly emerging and most promising scientific departments and the overall prospects of scientific development by rewarding the most important inventions and works.

    苏联党和政府恢复列宁奖金的决定  有助于把苏联科学提高到世界首位
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社报道：列宁科学技术奖金委员会主席?斯米扬诺夫院士9月9日在“真理报”上发表文章说：关于恢复列宁奖金的决定说明苏联共产党和苏联政府经常关怀苏联科学文化和技术方面的发展。
    ?斯米扬诺夫指出，苏联许多部门中科学技术已经达到了一个新的阶段。争取苏联科学、技术和生产的高度发展的斗争应当在各个战线上加强。把具有决定意义的科学技术提高到世界第一位，这是一个伟大的任务，但也是非常艰难的任务。毫无疑问，列宁奖金将有助于达到这一目的。
    由于苏联正在逐步向共产主义社会过渡，苏联科学界和全体苏联人民都在期待苏联社会科学家首先在社会主义社会发展规律方面有所论述。现在，苏联正在坚决地克服个人崇拜的后果，这就在社会科学工作者面前打开了更广阔的前景。
    ?斯米扬诺夫接着写道，按照规定，在授予列宁奖金以前要对受奖名单进行广泛的讨论。列宁奖金委员会所接受讨论的受奖名单将在报纸上公布，并且将通过各种形式展开广泛的讨论。委员会的任务不仅是正确估计各种发明和著作的价值，而且还有责任协助党和政府通过奖励最重要的发明和著作的办法来正确地估计新生的、最有希望的科学部门的发展前途和整个科学发展的前景。
