Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 5th. People in Guangzhou have been voicing their opinions, demanding that the British authorities in Hong Kong abolish the unreasonable "entry-exit balance" measures imposed on Chinese citizens entering and leaving Hong Kong.

	Feng Kuan, a resident of Longjin East Road, has a younger brother and sister-in-law in Hong Kong. In the past, due to the unreasonable restrictions of the so-called "entry-exit balance" imposed by the British authorities in Hong Kong, they were unable to see each other for several years. It was not until early this year, when the British authorities in Hong Kong, under the strong opposition of Hong Kong compatriots and people on the mainland, stopped this unreasonable restriction, that they had the opportunity to reunite in Guangzhou once. Feng Kuan said that the British authorities in Hong Kong were deliberately making things difficult for us, and we demand the immediate abolition of this unreasonable measure. Wang Mei, a relative of an overseas Chinese, is approaching her due date. Her mother and younger sister live in Hong Kong. She said that her mother had originally planned to return to take care of her during her delivery, but now that the British authorities in Hong Kong have announced the re-implementation of the so-called "entry-exit balance" method from the 3rd, it has made it more difficult for her mother to return to the mainland. The British authorities in Hong Kong should not adopt such an unreasonable attitude towards the Chinese people.

	Mo Ying-wei, former Hong Kong lawyer and Standing Committee Member of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the CPPCC, pointed out that the implementation of the "entry-exit balance" method not only harms the interests of the people on the mainland but also harms the interests of Hong Kong compatriots. Therefore, the British authorities in Hong Kong should immediately revoke this decision. Huang Changshui, Chairman of the Guangzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce, said that Chinese people entering and leaving Hong Kong is a traditional practice and a due right for more than a hundred years. Since liberation, the People's Government has made every effort to continuously improve the relations between the two regions and has adopted various specific measures to facilitate the exchanges between the people of the two regions, but the British authorities in Hong Kong have disregarded the demands and wishes of our people.

	Lin Zhicheng, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, Huang Jie, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Office of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, Liang Shangli, Liang Hai, Chen Zubei, Huang Yong'an, Vice Chairmen of the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Yu Junsheng, Secretary-General of the Guangzhou Municipal Association of Returned Overseas Chinese, all unanimously believe that the implementation of the so-called "entry-exit balance" method is an act of artificially isolating the blood ties between our compatriots, which is intolerable both morally and legally.

    广州市人民纷纷发表意见
    要求香港当局取消“出入平衡”的无理措施
    据新华社广州5日电　广州市人民纷纷要求香港英国当局取消对中国人民出入香港实行所谓“出入平衡”的无理措施。
    居住在龙津东路的居民冯宽，他的弟弟和弟妇都在香港，过去由于香港英国当局实行所谓“出入平衡”的无理限制，使他们弟兄好几年不能相见。直到今年年初香港英国当局在香港同胞和内地人民强烈反对下停止了这种无理限制后，他们才有机会在广州团聚一次。冯宽说香港英国当局的这种做法是故意与我们为难，我们要求立即取消这种无理措施。华侨家属王梅的产期将近了。她的母亲和妹妹等住在香港。她说，本来我母亲准备在我生产的时候回来照顾我的，现在香港英国当局宣布从3日起再次实行所谓“出入平衡”办法，这就给我的母亲返回内地增加了困难。香港英国当局不应该对中国人民采取这种无理的态度。
    前香港律师、政协广州市委员会常务委员莫应溎指出：实行“出入平衡”办法，不但损害内地人民的利益，也损害香港同胞的利益，因此香港英国当局应当立即撤销这一决定。广州市工商业联合会主任委员黄长水说，中国人民出入香港，是百余年来的传统惯例和应有的权利。解放以来，人民政府尽一切努力，不断改进两地区之间的关系，采取各种具体办法便利两地区人民的往来，但是香港英国当局却无视我国人民的要求和愿望。
    广东省工商业联合会副主任委员林志澄，广东省归国华侨联合会筹备处副主任委员黄洁，广州市工商业联合会副主任委员梁尚立、梁海、陈祖沛、黄永安，广州市归国华侨联谊会秘书长余俊生等都一致认为，所谓“出入平衡”办法的实施，是对我国同胞之间的血肉关系横加人为隔绝的行为，无论在道义上还是在法理上都是不能容忍的。
