Some Problems We Encounter in the Study of Chinese Philosophy History
Zhu Bokun

China's philosophical heritage is extremely rich. Summarizing and organizing the philosophical heritage of our motherland is a very serious task. Based on the teaching and research work of the Chinese Philosophy History Teaching and Research Section of Peking University in recent years, we feel that there are several academic issues that frequently cause controversy and have not been well resolved, thus frequently encountering difficulties in teaching and research. Now, we are raising some of the main issues for the academic community's reference.

(1) The issue of the object and scope of "Chinese Philosophy History." We believe that Chinese Philosophy History, like the philosophy history of other nations, should take the development of materialist philosophy and its struggle with idealist philosophy as the object and scope of research. However, there are different understandings of this issue. Some comrades believe that the struggle between materialism and idealism is mainly manifested in philosophical issues such as the view of nature, epistemology, and the view of history, therefore these issues should be the scope of philosophy history research. However, some comrades disagree with this view, believing that if limited to these issues, the content of Chinese Philosophy History would appear impoverished. Materials in these areas of Chinese Philosophy History are not very rich and cannot be compared with the West. Therefore, some comrades point out that general political thought, social thought, etc., should also be included, as materials in these areas are very rich, and it would be a pity to omit them. However, some comrades disagree with this expansion, believing that in this case, "Chinese Philosophy History" would become a history of the development of Chinese ideology. In fact, judging from the relevant published works, some are called "Chinese Philosophy History," some are called "Chinese Intellectual History," and some are called "Chinese Political Thought History," "Chinese Academic Thought History," etc. Although the names are different, the objects and scopes are almost the same. Of course, philosophical thought is related to other thoughts, and philosophical thought cannot be viewed in isolation, but one cannot equate problems in philosophy history with problems in other ideologies, otherwise, the domain of the science of "Chinese Philosophy History" will be blurred. This issue actually involves the nature of the science of "Philosophy History."

(2) The issue of analyzing and evaluating historical philosophers. Correctly analyzing and criticizing the thoughts of historical philosophers is not an easy task. This aspect is also the most likely to cause controversy. To sum up, there are the following points:

(1) The boundary between materialism and idealism. To analyze a philosopher's thought, one must always point out whether they belong to the camp of materialism or idealism on the basic question of philosophy. But it is not that simple to do. Some philosophers' thoughts have both materialist and idealist components, and it is difficult to say which aspect is fundamental. In our teaching, we once mentioned both the idealist and materialist components in the thoughts of ancient philosophers. As a result, students reflected that the camps were not clear and somewhat confusing. Later, we made improvements, and the battle lines were clear, but some people pointed out that this was too simplistic. Some people think that those assigned to the idealist camp have many materialist components; those assigned to the materialist camp, some people think, have many idealist components. Some comrades think it's better not to label them with materialism or idealism at all. But if you don't specify whether a philosopher is idealist or materialist when lecturing on philosophy history, what is the difference between that and the bourgeois philosophy history of the past?

(2) The issue of class analysis. In studying philosophy history, one must always point out which class's interests a certain school of philosophical thought basically represents. According to general understanding, idealism always represents the interests of historically reactionary and declining classes, while materialism always represents the interests of historically progressive classes. But this issue is also not that simple. Some people once believed that in Chinese feudal society, peasants were the exploited class, so the philosophical viewpoints reflecting the peasants should be materialist. But in reality, it is not. For example, the revolutionary thinkers of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom believed in God, and we cannot say that they were materialists in their worldview. Also, for example, the thoughts of the Taoists in the pre-Qin period, the doctrines of Lao Tzu and Zhuang Tzu, did not believe in God and ghosts, advocated "the natural way of heaven," and opposed teleology. They should be said to be ancient materialists and atheists. However, their (especially Zhuangzi's) social and political views strongly reflected the emotions of the declining aristocracy, and obviously represented the interests of the declining classes at that time. Conversely, Mencius expressed many remarks in social politics that were beneficial to the emerging feudal forces at that time, but on the basic question of philosophy, he believed in "heavenly mandate," spoke of mysticism, and advocated theocracy. How should we explain the relationship between these historical facts and the laws of philosophical development? If we say that these problems are just exceptions, but there are too many such exceptions in history, and the principle becomes problematic. In the past, some of our comrades adopted a simple method in order not to make mistakes in theory. If they encountered a materialist, they would try their best to find the progressive source of his class. For example, since it is affirmed that the ancient Taoists were a materialist school, then we should try to prove that they represented the interests of the peasants, but in fact, the evidence in this regard is very limited. In addition, the vast majority of philosophers in Chinese feudal society were associated with the feudal landlord class. Some of them were progressive, and some were reactionary. How should we understand the ideological struggle between them? In the past, it was handled like this: reactionary philosophers always represented the interests of the feudal aristocracy and large landlord class; progressive philosophers represented the interests of the small and medium landlord class. Later, some people opposed this simple approach. Because the philosophers of the small and medium landlord class basically still represented the interests of the feudal class. It is difficult to explain their progressiveness in feudal society with the label of class. Some people say that a history of ancient Chinese philosophy, the ideas in it, whether they represent large landlords or small landlords, there is actually no class analysis. These problems are not merely problems of how to analyze specific materials, but also involve certain theoretical issues related to historical materialism.

(3) The issue of evaluating idealism. Some of our comrades, especially some young comrades, once adopted a completely negative attitude towards historical idealists. Even if there were some good things in it, they were unwilling to talk about them. And the analysis of idealist philosophy was too simplified, believing that as long as it was pointed out that he was an idealist and served the reactionary class, the goal was achieved. Moreover, in order to strengthen the party principle of philosophy history, they often cursed the idealists in their lectures, thinking that they had completed the task. Obviously, this way of treating idealism cannot meet the current requirements. How should we analyze and criticize it? Are there any good things in the idealist system? If so, how should we evaluate them? For example, some comrades believe that Wang Yangming's theory of "innate knowledge" affirms innate concepts, which is an idealist view. However, it also teaches people to establish an independent and enterprising spirit, adhere to the attitude of right and wrong, not blindly follow others, oppose traditional constraints, and has indeed had a great influence on some progressive thinkers in history. Can we dismiss it with a single stroke just because it is an idealist view? For example, some comrades believe that the historical idealist philosophical system has also played a certain role in promoting the development of materialism. Materialists often use the questions raised by idealists to enrich their own content. Therefore, some of their contributions cannot be ignored. The above opinions are worthy of attention and further study.

(4) The issue of the elements of dialectical materialism and historical materialism. Before the emergence of Marxist philosophy, were there any viewpoints or elements of dialectical materialism and historical materialism in philosophy history? In the past, some of our comrades believed that dialectical materialism viewpoints only appeared after the emergence of Marxist philosophy. If one attempts to find viewpoints of materialist dialectics from pre-Marxist philosophy, it is to compare ancient philosophy with Marxist philosophy, which is wrong and violates the party principle of Marxist philosophy. Therefore, when dealing with ancient philosophical issues, one can only say that a certain philosopher has a materialist viewpoint on some issues, and a dialectical element on other issues. Ancient philosophers did not combine the two. But the actual situation is not entirely like this. Even on the same issue, there are both materialist and dialectical views. For example, the theory of "qi" in classical Chinese philosophy affirms that the material basis of the world is "qi," which is a simple materialist worldview, but at the same time affirms that "qi" itself, as the material basis of the world, is constantly changing and developing, and even some materialists believe that "qi" itself is constantly being renewed. Isn't this also treating the material origin of the world with a dialectical viewpoint? There are quite a few such problems in the history of Chinese philosophy. Secondly, some comrades also believe that the views of philosophers before Marxism on social and historical issues are all idealist. But some comrades have suggested that we certainly cannot say that philosophers before Marxism have established a system of historical materialism, but have they also put forward materialist viewpoints on individual issues in the social and historical aspects? For the past few years, we have not dared to explicitly affirm this, for fear of making mistakes. For example, in our teaching, we once pointed out that Han Fei's view of history has materialist elements. Because Han Fei does not recognize the will of God and people's subjective wishes as the driving force of social development, but affirms that the increase in social population and the amount of social wealth are the basic causes of social change. Of course, this view is unscientific, but he attempted to find the basic causes of social change from the material living conditions of society itself, which is materialism. There are many such examples in Chinese philosophy history. For example, Xunzi's theory of the evil of human nature affirms that human nature is evil, which is an idealist statement. However, he affirms that people's moral character is not innate, but cultivated by the acquired environment, which is a materialist viewpoint. How should we treat Xunzi's ethical theory? Can we say that Xunzi's ethical view has materialist elements? Some people say that if these problems are not clarified, then the valuable opinions on social and historical issues in Chinese philosophy history will all be wiped out with the big hat of idealism. This view is indeed reasonable.

(3) The issue of the characteristics of Chinese philosophy. In the past, when we lectured on Chinese philosophy history, we emphasized the general laws of philosophy history, so we could not see the characteristics of Chinese philosophy. Recently, many comrades have pointed out that this approach is wrong, and we should focus on elucidating the characteristics of Chinese philosophy. But what exactly do the characteristics of Chinese philosophy include? Some comrades believe that philosophers in Chinese history have always attached great importance to social and political issues, and their philosophical viewpoints are closely related to the social practice of the time, which is a major characteristic of Chinese philosophy. Some comrades believe that materialist philosophy in Chinese feudal society has its own unique form. Three forms of materialism have appeared in Western philosophy history—simple materialism, metaphysical materialism, and dialectical materialism. These three forms cannot explain the characteristics of classical Chinese materialism. Because classical Chinese materialism contains clear spontaneous dialectical elements, which in many ways surpasses the simple materialist form of ancient Western civilization. On the other hand, the Chinese bourgeoisie in modern times has not established a metaphysical materialist system like the West. Therefore, we cannot simply use the process of Western philosophical development to compare with the process of Chinese philosophical development. Some people also believe that the study of the characteristics of Chinese philosophy should focus on pointing out the special problems in Chinese philosophy history, and through these special problems, we can see the general laws of the struggle between materialism and idealism. For example, the debate on "name" and "reality" in the pre-Qin era, the debate on "honoring existence" and "valuing non-existence" in the Wei and Jin dynasties, the debate on "principle" and "qi" in the Song, Ming, and Qing dynasties, etc. Others believe that Chinese materialist thought is often closely linked with atheism. Even the historically famous idealist schools, such as Cheng and Zhu, opposed religious superstition. If we say that they, like Western idealists, finally turned to God, then it would not be in line with the development of idealist philosophy in Chinese history. The great influence of atheism in ancient Chinese thought should also be one of the characteristics of the development of Chinese philosophy. In short, there are many problems in this regard, and it is necessary to vigorously carry out research. Otherwise, it is easy to turn Chinese philosophy history into a replica of Western philosophy history.

(4) On how to inherit and carry forward the philosophical heritage of the motherland. We unanimously affirm that there is a rich and valuable philosophical heritage in Chinese history. But how should we inherit this heritage and serve the current socialist construction? In the past, some comrades believed that studying Chinese philosophy history was only to enhance their national self-confidence and encourage people's patriotism. Apart from this, it is difficult to say what use it has. Because historical idealism is all bad, and there is only criticism, and it is difficult to absorb. And historical materialism is very poor compared with Marxist philosophy. Marxist philosophy has all the good things, so why bother looking for them in old paper piles? Of course, this view has a narrow pragmatic tendency. However, this view reflects an actual situation, that is, the research of Chinese philosophy history has not been well combined with modern revolutionary practice. Many of our comrades have attempted to solve this problem. For example, some people pointed out that there have been many examples in Chinese history of solving basic philosophical problems materialistically. For example, Fan Zhen, an outstanding atheist in ancient times, used the argument on the relationship between form and spirit to explain the relationship between spirit and matter, which is still very powerful, and it is also a contribution of the Chinese people themselves, so it is particularly intimate to use. Some people pointed out that the criticism of ancient Chinese idealist philosophy can clear away the influence on modern people and strengthen the publicity of Marxist philosophy. Still others have proposed the issue of inheriting the philosophical form of their own nation. It is believed that in the field of literature and art, we can advocate the national form and socialist content. Why can't we do this in the field of philosophy? For example, ancient Confucian scholars advocated moral norms such as "benevolence," "righteousness," "propriety," "wisdom," and "trustworthiness" in social ethics. Of course, in terms of their class content, these moral norms served the feudal landlord class and were used to maintain the feudal hierarchy. But extracting their class content and instilling socialist morality can still serve socialist construction. Don't we need to advocate loving mankind now? Don't we advocate being polite? Don't we advocate keeping our promises? Some comrades oppose this view, on the grounds that the form and content of philosophy cannot be separated. If the class content is abandoned, this form becomes superfluous, and this inheritance is actually only an inheritance of the nouns and vocabularies used by a nation, and has nothing to do with the inheritance of thought itself. Therefore, this inheritance is really meaningless. Some comrades disagree with this view, believing that the problem is not that simple. For example, Confucius and Mencius often taught people to have the moral qualities of "sacrificing one's life to achieve benevolence" and "abandoning one's body to take righteousness." Of course, in terms of the social significance at the time, it was to call on people to obey the interests of feudal society. However, this doctrine itself contains altruistic elements, which are opposed to the ideology of individual egoism, and has played an educational role on the Chinese people. Precisely because of this, we can use these forms today. In short, there are also many problems in this regard. On the one hand, we must oppose national nihilism; on the other hand, we must also oppose feudal restorationism. How to do it correctly is indeed a more difficult thing.

The above problems are just the more significant problems we have discovered in the past in teaching and research and scientific discussions. There are many other specific problems that have not been resolved. The presentation of these problems reflects, on the one hand, that some comrades have been influenced by dogmatism in the past, but on the other hand, it also reflects that many comrades are conducting independent thinking and resisting dogmatic research trends. We believe that these problems can be gradually resolved in the atmosphere of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" in the future. From the above problems, we can also see that the research of Chinese philosophy history is not only a simple historical problem, but also a theoretical problem of philosophy itself. We firmly believe that through the research of Chinese philosophy history, it is possible to enrich and develop the content of Marxist philosophy. We sincerely hope that experts and scholars in this field, as well as comrades who are interested in Chinese philosophy history, will provide valuable opinions, conduct debates, and conduct joint research to improve the scientific level of Chinese philosophy history.

    我们在中国哲学史研究中所遇到的一些问题
    朱伯昆
    中国的哲学遗产是十分丰富的。总结和整理祖国的哲学遗产，是一件十分严重的任务。就北京大学中国哲学史教研室几年来的教学研究工作看，我们觉得有以下几个学术问题，时常引起争论，没有得到很好的解决，因此，在教学和研究中时常遭到困难。现在把一些主要问题提出来，以供学术界参考。
    （一）关于“中国哲学史”的对象和范围问题。我们认为中国哲学史和其他各民族的哲学史一样，应该把唯物主义哲学的发展及其跟唯心主义哲学的斗争，作为研究的对象和范围。但对这个问题，却有不同的理解。有些同志认为，唯物和唯心的斗争主要表现在自然观、认识论、历史观等哲学问题上，因此应该把这些问题作为哲学史研究的范围。但有的同志不同意这种意见，认为如果仅仅限于这些问题，那末中国哲学史的内容就显得贫乏了。中国哲学史这些方面的材料，不太丰富，不能跟西方相比。因此，有些同志指出，还应该把一般的政治思想、社会思想等都包括在内，这些方面的材料是十分丰富的，如果遗漏掉，就太可惜了。但又有些同志不同意这种扩大化的办法，认为这样一来，“中国哲学史”就成了一部中国意识形态发展史了。实际上就已出版的有关这方面的著作来看，有的叫做“中国哲学史”，有的叫做“中国思想史”，有的又叫做“中国政治思想史”、“中国学术思想史”等，名目虽然不同，但是对象和范围都差不多。当然，哲学思想跟其他思想是有联系的，不能孤立地看哲学思想，但也不能因此便把哲学史上的问题和其他意识形态的问题等同起来，否则，就会使“中国哲学史”这门科学的领域模糊不清了。这个问题实际上牵涉到“哲学史”这门科学的性质问题。
    （二）关于对历史上哲学家的分析和评价问题。对历史上哲学家的思想进行正确的分析和批判，并不是一件容易的事。这方面的问题，也是最容易引起争论的，综合起来，有以下几点：
    （1）唯物和唯心的界限问题。分析一个哲学家的思想，总要指出在哲学基本问题上属于唯物主义，还是唯心主义的阵营。但作起来并不那末简单；有的哲学家的思想，既有唯物主义的成分，又有唯心主义的成分，二者很难说哪一方面是基本的。我们在教学中曾经把古代哲学家思想中的唯心和唯物的成分，都提了一下，结果同学反映说，阵营不清楚，有些混乱。后来作了改进，阵线是清楚了，但有人又指出，这样做，太简单化了。划到唯心主义阵营的，有人认为有很多的唯物主义成分；划到唯物主义阵营的，有人又认为有许多唯心主义成分。有的同志认为索性不扣什么唯心和唯物的帽子。但讲哲学史，不指明一个哲学家是唯心或唯物，那和过去资产阶级的哲学史又有什么区别呢？
    （2）阶级分析问题。研究哲学史，总要指出某一派的哲学观点基本上代表那个阶级的利益。按照一般的说法，唯心主义总是代表历史上反动和没落阶级的利益，而唯物主义总是代表历史上进步的阶级的利益。但这个问题，也不是那末简单。有人曾经认为在中国的封建社会中，农民是被剥削的阶级，因此反映农民的哲学观点，应该是唯物主义的。但实际上并不然。例如，太平天国的革命思想家，相信上帝，总不能说，他们在世界观上是唯物主义者。又如，先秦道家的思想，老子、庄子的学说，不相信上帝和鬼神，提倡“天道自然”，反对目的论，应该说是古代的唯物主义者和无神论者。但他们（尤其是庄子）的社会政治观点，却强烈地反映了没落贵族的情绪，显然是代表当时没落阶级的利益。与此相反，孟子在社会政治上发表了许多有利于当时新兴封建势力的言论，但他在哲学基本问题上却信“天命”，讲神秘主义，主张神权政治。怎样说明这些历史事实和哲学发展规律的关系呢？如果说，这些问题只是例外，但历史上这种例外太多了，原则也就成问题了。过去，我们有些同志，为了在理论上不犯错误，采取了简单的办法。如果碰到一个唯物主义者，就想尽办法，从阶级上找出他的进步的根源。例如，既然肯定古代道家是唯物主义流派，那末就应该想法证明他们代表农民的利益，而实际上这方面的证据是十分有限的。此外，中国封建社会中的哲学家，绝大多数都是和封建地主阶级有联系的。其中有进步的，也有反动的。他们之间的思想斗争应怎样理解呢？过去曾经这样处理过：反动的哲学家总是代表封建贵族和大地主阶层的利益；进步的哲学家代表中小地主阶层的利益。后来有人反对这种简单的处理方法。因为中小地主阶层的哲学家，基本上还是代表封建阶级的利益，用阶级的帽子，很难说明他们在封建社会中的进步性。有人说，一部中国古代哲学史，其中的思想，说来说去，不是代表大地主，就是代表小地主，实际上没有什么阶级分析。这些问题，不仅仅是对具体材料如何分析的问题，同时也牵涉到有关历史唯物主义的某些理论问题。
    （3）对唯心主义的评价问题。我们有些同志，尤其是一些年青的同志，曾经对历史上的唯心主义者采取了全盘否定的态度。即使其中有些好东西，也不愿讲。并且对唯心主义哲学的分析，过于简单化，认为只要指明他是个唯心主义者，是为反动阶级服务的，目的就达到了。而且为了加强哲学史的党性原则，在讲授中往往把唯心主义者臭骂一顿，以为就算完成任务了。显然，这种对待唯心主义的方式，不能满足目前的要求了。应该怎样分析批判呢？唯心主义体系中有没有好东西？如果有，应该怎样估价呢？例如，有的同志认为王阳明的“良知良能”的学说，肯定了天赋观念，这是唯心主义观点。但它却又教导人们树立独立进取的精神，坚持是非的态度，不盲从别人，反对传统的束缚，并且在历史上的确对某些进步思想家起了很大的影响。能够因为是唯心主义观点，就一笔勾消它吗？又如有的同志认为历史上唯心主义哲学体系，对唯物主义的发展也起过一定的促进作用。唯物主义者时常用唯心主义者所提出的问题，来丰富自己的内容的。因此，他们的某些贡献也不能抹煞。以上这些意见都是值得重视和进一步钻研的。
    （4）关于辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的因素问题。在马克思主义哲学出现以前，哲学史上有没有辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的观点或因素呢？过去，我们有些同志认为，只有马克思主义哲学出现以后，才有辩证唯物主义的观点。如果企图从马克思主义以前的哲学中寻找唯物辩证法的观点，就是用古代哲学比附马克思主义哲学，这是错误的，是违反了马克思主义哲学的党性原则。因此，在处理古代哲学问题时，只能说，某一哲学家，在某种问题上有唯物主义的观点，而在另外一些问题上，才有辩证法的因素。古代哲学家并没有把二者结合起来。但实际情况，并非完全如此。就是对同一问题说，也有既唯物而又辩证的看法。例如，中国古典哲学中关于“气”的学说，肯定世界的物质基础是“气”，这是素朴的唯物主义世界观，但同时肯定作为世界物质基础的“气”本身又是不断变化和发展的，甚至有的唯物主义者认为“气”本身也是不断更新的。这不又是以一种辩证的观点来对待世界的物质根源问题吗？这类的问题，在中国哲学史上不算少的。其次，有些同志还认为，马克思主义以前的哲学家，对社会历史问题的看法，都是唯心主义的。但有的同志提出，我们当然不能说，马克思主义以前的哲学家已建立了历史唯物主义的体系，但是否在社会历史方面的各别问题上，他们也提出过唯物主义的观点呢？几年来，对这个问题，我们不敢明确肯定，恐怕犯错误。例如，我们在教学中，曾经指出韩非的历史观具有唯物主义的因素。因为，韩非不承认上帝的意志和人的主观愿望是社会发展的动力，而肯定社会人口的增加和社会财富的多寡是社会变动的基本原因。当然，这种看法是不科学的，但他企图从社会本身的物质生活条件中去寻找社会变动的基本原因，这是唯物主义的。这类例子在中国哲学史上是很多的。例如，荀子的性恶论，肯定人性是恶的，这是一种唯心主义的提法。但是，他却肯定人的道德品质并不是天赋的，而是后天的环境养成的，这又是一种唯物主义的观点。应该怎样对待荀子的伦理学说呢？能不能说，荀子的伦理观具有唯物主义的因素呢？有人说，如果不把这类问题弄清楚，那就会把中国哲学史上对于社会历史问题的宝贵意见，都用唯心主义的大帽子抹煞了。这种意见，的确是有道理的。
    （三）关于中国哲学的特点问题。过去，我们讲授中国哲学史时，强调了哲学史的一般规律，因而，看不出中国哲学的特色。最近，很多同志都指出这种做法是不对的，应该着重阐明中国哲学的特点。但中国哲学的特点，究竟包括那些内容呢？有的同志认为，中国历代哲学家都特别重视社会政治问题，他们的哲学观点和当时社会实践有密切的联系，这是中国哲学的一大特色。有的同志认为中国封建社会中的唯物主义哲学，有着他自己独特的形式。在西方哲学史上出现了三种唯物主义的形式——素朴的唯物主义，形而上学的唯物主义和辩证唯物主义。这三种形式都不能说明中国古典唯物主义的特点。因为中国的古典唯物主义含有鲜明的自发的辩证法的因素，在许多问题上超过了西方古代的素朴的唯物主义形态。另一方面，中国近代的资产阶级，也没有建立起西方那样的形而上学的唯物主义体系。因而，不能简单地用西方哲学发展的过程，来比附中国哲学发展的过程。还有人认为研究中国哲学的特点，应该着重指出中国哲学史上的特殊问题，通过这些特殊问题，来看唯物主义反对唯心主义斗争的总的规律。例如，先秦时代关于“名”和“实”的争论问题，魏晋时代的“崇有”和“贵无”的争论问题，宋明清时代关于“理”和“气”的争论问题等。又有人认为，中国的唯物主义思想经常跟无神论紧密联系在一起的。甚至于历史上著名的唯心主义流派，如程、朱等，也都反对宗教迷信，如果说，他们和西方的唯心主义者一样，最后也倒向了上帝，那就不合乎中国历史上唯心主义哲学发展的情况。无神论在中国古代思想界所起的巨大的影响，也应该是中国哲学发展的特点之一。总之，这方面的问题也是很多的，很需要大力开展研究。不然的话，很容易把中国哲学史讲成西方哲学史的翻版。
    （四）关于如何继承和发扬祖国的哲学遗产问题。我们一致肯定在中国历史上有着丰富和珍贵的哲学遗产。但应该如何继承这份遗产，为当前的社会主义建设服务呢？过去，有的同志认为研究中国哲学史，只不过是提高自己的民族自信心，鼓舞人们的爱国主义情绪而已，除此以外，很难说有什么用处。因为，历史上的唯心主义，都是些坏东西，只有批判，很难吸收。而历史上的唯物主义，跟马克思主义哲学比较起来，又非常贫乏。好东西，马克思主义哲学都有了，何必再向旧纸堆中寻找呢？当然，这种观点，有着狭隘的实用主义的倾向。但这种看法却反映了一种实际情况，即目前还没有把中国哲学史的研究跟现代的革命实际很好地结合起来。我们有许多同志曾经企图解决这个问题。例如，有人指出，中国历史上有过许多唯物主义地解决哲学基本问题的范例。如古代杰出的无神论者范缜，对形神关系的论证，现在用来说明精神和物质的依赖关系，也是很有力的，而且又是中国人自己的贡献，所以用来特别亲切。有人指出，对中国古代唯心主义哲学的批判，可以肃清对现代人的影响，加强宣传马克思主义哲学。更有人提出了继承自己民族的哲学形式的问题。认为在文学和艺术领域中，可以提倡民族的形式和社会主义的内容，在哲学领域中，为什么不可以这样做呢？例如，古代的儒家学者，在社会伦理观点上，提倡过“仁”“义”“礼”“智”“信”等道德规范。当然，这些道德规范，就其阶级内容说，是为封建地主阶级服务的，是用来维护封建等级制度的。但抽掉它们的阶级内容，灌入社会主义的道德，仍可以为社会主义建设服务。难道我们现在就不需要提倡爱人类吗？不提倡有礼貌吗？不提倡守信用吗？有的同志反对这种意见，理由是，哲学的形式和内容是不能分割的，抛弃了阶级内容，这种形式也就成了多余的东西了，而这种继承，实际上只是一个民族所使用的名词和辞汇的继承，和思想本身的继承，没有什么关系。所以，这种继承，实在没有什么意义。有的同志不同意这种意见，认为问题并不那末简单。例如，孔孟经常教导人们要具有“杀身成仁”和“舍身取义”的道德品质，当然，就当时的社会意义说，是叫人们服从封建社会的利益。但这种学说本身却含有利他主义的因素，是跟个人利己主义的思想相对立的，而且曾对中国人起过教育的作用，正因为如此，我们今天才可以利用这些形式。总之，这方面的问题也是很多的。一方面，要反对民族虚无主义；一方面，也要反对封建复古主义。如何能够作得正确，的确也是一件比较困难的事情。
    以上几个问题，不过是我们过去在教学和研究以及科学讨论会中所发现的比较显著的问题。其它没有解决的具体问题还很多。以上这些问题的提出，一方面反映了过去有些同志受了教条主义的影响，但一方面也反映了许多同志进行着独立的思考，在反对教条主义的研究风气。我们相信，这些问题，今后在百家争鸣的空气中，是可以逐步解决的。从以上这些问题中，我们还可以看出，中国哲学史的研究，不仅仅是单纯的历史问题，同时也是哲学本身的理论问题。我们深信，通过中国哲学史的研究，是可以丰富和发展马克思主义哲学的内容的。我们很希望这方面的专家和学者，以及对中国哲学史有兴趣的同志们，多多提供宝贵的意见，进行争辩，共同研究，把中国哲学史的科学水平提高一步。
