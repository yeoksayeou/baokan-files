Xinhua News Agency, 29th. A general strike and market closure were held in most parts of Algeria on the 28th, in response to the call of the "Arab People's Congress," to protest the French authorities' kidnapping of Algerian national leaders. Near the city of Tablat in Algeria, French military transport was ambushed by insurgents on the 27th, resulting in 31 French soldiers dead and many injured.

In Tunisia, conflicts occurred in many places as local residents blocked the movement of French troops, resulting in 14 deaths, including eight Tunisians and six French, and sixty injuries.

Tunisian Secretary of State for Information, Ben Yahmed, condemned the French government's policy towards North Africa at a press conference on the 27th. He believes that this policy destroys trust in France and deepens the danger of war throughout North Africa.

The situation in Morocco is equally tense. According to Agence France-Presse, about two hundred French farms have been burned in the Meknes area alone in recent days. A major fire also occurred in Fedala, 30 kilometers from Casablanca. At the port of Casablanca, French ships carrying military supplies are still unable to unload due to the firm resistance of Moroccan dockworkers.

The new Moroccan government also issued a communique on the 28th, reiterating the solidarity of the Moroccan people with the Algerian people in the "struggle for freedom." The communique condemned the French kidnapping of Algerian national leaders as "illegal" and "hostile."

Xinhua News Agency, 29th. According to reports from the capitals of Arab countries, people in Arab countries from the Atlantic to the Persian Gulf held a general strike on October 28th to protest the French authorities' kidnapping of leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Movement.

Cairo and other cities in Egypt held a 24-hour strike. The strike did not affect navigation in the Suez Canal. Public utilities, such as gas and water companies, continued to operate as usual. Food supplies were normal.

A general strike was held throughout Syria. Demonstrations were held in Damascus, and a mass rally was held in front of the parliament building. The Speaker of Parliament, Nazem al-Kudsi, and others spoke at the rally.

According to Al-Alam, the Syrian Parliament passed a resolution on October 27th, unanimously condemning the French authorities' kidnapping of Algerian leaders. The parliament recommended that the government call on all Arab countries to impose political, economic, and cultural boycotts on France.

In Amman, the capital of Jordan, thousands of people held demonstrations to protest the French authorities' kidnapping. Participants in the march chanted slogans such as "Down with the brutal imperialists!" "Long live Algeria!"

Several thousand people in the Jordanian area of Jerusalem held a gathering in a mosque, and then held a demonstration in front of the French consulate.

Workers in Iraq held protest strikes. Most stores in Baghdad were closed on this day.

Lebanon held a general strike. Businesses, agencies, and shops all stopped working.

Tripoli, the capital of Libya, held a general strike like other Arab capitals. All shops, commercial enterprises, and financial institutions in the city were closed. Because the authorities banned any demonstrations, Tripoli's streets, especially the main streets, were patrolled by police.
