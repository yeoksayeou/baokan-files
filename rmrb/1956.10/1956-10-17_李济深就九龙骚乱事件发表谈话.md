Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Li Jishen issued a statement today regarding the riots instigated by Kuomintang secret agents in Kowloon. The text is as follows:

    Kuomintang secret agents, who have consistently been condoned by the British authorities in Hong Kong and Kowloon, have been continuously organizing riots in Kowloon since October 10th. They have been slaughtering and looting Chinese compatriots living in Kowloon, as well as factories, shops, and schools run by our compatriots, committing all kinds of atrocities. Our compatriots have suffered significant casualties, and their property has suffered severe losses. This is what the people of the entire country resent. We express our deep concern and condolences for the tragic experiences of our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. We will never tolerate the Kuomintang secret agents' criminal acts of harming our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

    The British authorities in Hong Kong bear absolute responsibility for ensuring the safety of Hong Kong and Kowloon residents. However, they neither paid attention to prevention beforehand, nor did they take effective measures to promptly stop the riots afterwards. On the contrary, they deliberately spread lies, confused right and wrong, and attempted to shirk their responsibility and exonerate the Kuomintang secret agents, the instigators of the riots. This attitude of the British authorities in Hong Kong has left the safety of our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon completely unprotected. If this attitude of the British authorities in Hong Kong is not due to their inability to maintain social order in Hong Kong and Kowloon, then it is for ulterior motives! Premier Zhou Enlai of our State Council has already lodged a stern protest with the British government on October 13th regarding this matter and demanded a reply from the British government. We fully support this solemn measure by the government.

    Our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon are still in the midst of disaster, and we cannot tolerate such disasters continuing. We demand that the British authorities in Hong Kong immediately change their outrageous attitude towards the riots, quickly take strict measures to punish the rioters as they deserve, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again in the future.

    李济深就九龙骚乱事件发表谈话
    新华社16日讯　李济深今日就国民党特务分子在九龙制造暴乱一事发表谈话。文如下：
    一向被英国当局纵容在香港、九龙的国民党特务分子，从10月10日起不断地在九龙组织暴乱，向住在九龙的中国同胞和同胞们所经营的工厂、商店、学校等残杀焚劫，无所不为，我同胞的生命遭着重大伤亡，财产受到严重损失，这是全国人民所愤恨的。对于港九同胞的惨痛遭遇，我们表示深切的关怀和慰问。我们决不能容忍国民党特务危害港九同胞的罪恶行为。
    香港英国当局，对保障港九居民安全负有绝对的责任，但是他们事前既不注意防范，事后又不采取有效措施迅予制止暴乱。相反，还有意散布谎言，混乱黑白，企图为自己卸责，并为暴乱祸首国民党特务分子开脱罪行。香港英国当局这种态度，已使我港九同胞的安全毫无保障。香港英国当局这种态度，如果不是无力维持港九社会秩序的话，便是别有用心！我国务院周恩来总理已于10月13日就此事向英国政府提出严正抗议，并要求英国政府给予答复。我们完全拥护政府这一严正的措施。
    港九同胞还处在灾难中，我们不能容忍这样的灾难再延续下去。我们要求香港英国当局立即改变对待暴乱的令人愤慨的态度，迅速采取严厉措施，对暴乱者予以应有的惩处，并保证今后不再有类似事件发生。
