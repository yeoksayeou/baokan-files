    The Names of the Volunteer Army Martyrs Will Forever Remain in the Hearts of the People
    Cui Jiashan
    In the countryside of Pingquan County, South Hwanghae Province, Korea, there is an agricultural production cooperative named after the Chinese People's Volunteer Army martyrs Lü Yujiu and Zhang Minglu. This agricultural cooperative has been in existence for two and a half years. According to local cadres, it was one of the earliest cooperatives established in the county, and it is now one of the best agricultural cooperatives in the county.
    On April 21, 1953, gasoline bombs dropped by American planes on Geumgang Mountain in Pingquan County caused a major fire. Lü Yujiu and Zhang Minglu rushed into the flames twice, rescuing eight Korean women who were surrounded by the fire. They unfortunately sacrificed themselves when they rushed into the flames again. In order to forever commemorate the heroic deeds of these two martyrs, the people of Pingquan County built a martyrs' cemetery on Houfeng Mountain in Hancun, near the site of the martyrs' sacrifice. The agricultural cooperative named after the martyrs is also composed of residents from Hancun and several neighboring villages.
    Hancun is located in a mountainous area not far north of the 38th parallel. None of us who traveled together had been there before. Therefore, on the journey of less than ten kilometers from Yeonan County, south of the 38th parallel, to Hancun, we had to stop several times to ask for directions. However, as soon as you mentioned the Lü Yujiu and Zhang Minglu Agricultural Production Cooperative, without any necessary explanation, whether it was passing pedestrians, farmers resting in the fields, people going to the market, or whether they were old people, women, or children, they would give you a satisfactory answer.
    We visited in mid-October. This was the time when the rice was ripe and fragrant. Everywhere on the plains and in the mountain valleys, you could see patches of golden rice fields. This agricultural cooperative was also busy with the autumn harvest. The dryland crops on the plains north of the small river had already been harvested. The harvest of dozens of hectares of rice south of the small river had also begun. Tractors were plowing the already harvested dryland, and the cooperative members were busily sowing winter wheat.
    This well-known agricultural cooperative has developed greatly after several years of operation. Now there are 106 peasant households in the cooperative, with more than 200 hectares of cultivated land. When the cooperative was established in April 1954, there were only 10 households and only 25 hectares of cultivated land. Li Haoshi, a Korean woman rescued by the martyrs, is a member of the management committee of this agricultural cooperative. In May 1953, the second month after the martyrs' sacrifice, the eight rescued Korean women formed the Lü Yujiu and Zhang Minglu Production Assault Team. At that time, she was the captain of this team. The Production Assault Team's flag is still preserved in this agricultural cooperative.
    Not far from the agricultural cooperative, under Houfeng Mountain, which was still lush green in late autumn, the Hancun People's Committee is located. Nearby are spacious democratic propaganda rooms, clinics and consumer cooperatives serving the farmers, and Pingquan County No. 4 Middle School. Farmhouses surrounded by patches of green vegetable gardens are distributed along the foothills on both sides of the plain and along the highway that runs through the plain. Most of these buildings and villages were restored or newly built in the years after the war. The residents here migrated back from the hidden valleys after the war and rebuilt their homes. In these peaceful and happy days, they have not forgotten the Volunteer Army who once spent difficult years with them. Local residents, students, and cadres visit the martyrs' cemetery on Houfeng Mountain every year to pay their respects.
    In order to commemorate the Volunteer Army martyrs, the Young Pioneers and the Democratic Youth League in the school have established the Lü Yujiu Branch and the Zhang Minglu Class. Three batches of students who have received this title have graduated successively. The school's wall newspaper is named "Geumgang Mountain," the place where the two martyrs sacrificed themselves. The wall newspaper often publishes articles and poems written by teachers and students in memory of the martyrs, as well as letters and replies from students to the martyrs' relatives. Several times a year, the students write letters to Lü Yujiu's home in Sichuan and Zhang Minglu's home in Henan to greet the martyrs' parents.
    On holidays, teachers sometimes lead students to visit Geumgang Mountain, introducing the martyrs' glorious deeds to the students on the spot. In June of this year, all the Young Pioneers in Pingquan County came to Hancun to spend their summer camp life. They paid their respects at the martyrs' cemetery, visited Li Haoshi at the agricultural cooperative, and listened to her tell her personal experience of being rescued. The students of the Fourth Middle School also performed an opera they created based on the martyrs' deeds.
    Today, some of the eight Korean women rescued by the martyrs have moved back to their hometowns, or have married and left their hometowns. Li Haoshi, who remained in the area, is now the mother of two children. Her husband was demobilized from the People's Army last spring and is now the leader of the agricultural cooperative's work team. In the four years since her husband joined the army, her elderly mother-in-law and young children have relied on her labor to maintain their lives. Now she has become the backbone of the agricultural cooperative, and the work team she is in is also one of the best work teams in the entire cooperative. Her production performance in the work team is also very good.
    Zheng Jingnan and Shen Xuanhua, who are only eighteen years old this year, were only fifteen years old when they were rescued. Now they have both joined the agricultural cooperative in Jia Dongli and have become members of the local Democratic Youth League organization. Cui Chunfeng, a middle-aged woman who was rescued, is now the chairman of the Farmers' League Committee in the village. Her husband was killed by the enemy during the war, and she is raising the two children he left behind by herself. Now, they are all activists on the labor front. They have realized their vow. At the inauguration ceremony of the martyrs' monument on August 22, 1953, their newly established production assault team made the following vow to the martyrs: Your great internationalist spirit will forever live in our hearts. We guarantee that we will never disgrace your name and will forever move forward in the cause of restoring and building our motherland.

    志愿军烈士的英名永远留在人民的心里
    崔佳山
    在朝鲜黄海南道平泉郡的农村里，有一个以中国人民志愿军烈士吕玉久和张明禄的名字命名的农业生产合作社。这个农业社已经有两年半的历史。据当地干部说，这是全郡最早建立的一个社，现在也是全郡优秀的农业社中的一个。
    1953年4月21日，平泉郡金刚山上被美国飞机投掷的汽油弹引起大火，吕玉久和张明禄两次冲进烈火救出被大火包围的八个朝鲜妇女，当他们再次冲进烈火时，不幸牺牲。平泉郡人民为了永远纪念这两位烈士的英雄事迹，在烈士牺牲地点附近汉村里的后峰山上修建了烈士陵。以烈士的名字命名的这个农业社，也是由汉村里和邻近几个村落的居民组成的。
    汉村里在三八线以北不远的山区里，我们同行的几个人以前都没有去过。因此，从三八线以南的延安郡到汉村里不到十多公里的路程中，不得不几次停下来问路。但是，当你一提到吕玉久、张明禄农业生产合作社，不用你作必要的说明，无论是过往行人、在田间休息的农民或是赶集的人，也不论是老人、妇女或者小孩，都会给你满意的答复。
    我们是10月中旬去访问的。这时正当稻谷熟透喷香的时候，在平原和山间的平川上，到处都可以看见一片片黄灿灿的稻田。这个农业社也正在忙着秋收。在小河北边平川上的旱田作物已经收割完了，小河南边的几十公顷水稻也开始收割，已经割完的旱田上，拖拉机正在耕地，社员们忙碌地在播种秋麦。
    这个远近知名的农业社经过几年的经营有了很大发展。现在入社农民已经有一百零六户，耕地二百多公顷，而在1954年4月建社的时候，社员只有十户，耕地才有二十五公顷。为烈士救出的朝鲜妇女李好世是这个农业社管理委员会的委员。在1953年5月，就是烈士牺牲后的第二个月，遇救的八名朝鲜妇女组成了吕玉久、张明禄生产突击队，那时，她是这个队的队长。生产突击队的队旗至今还保存在这个农业社里。
    离农业社不远，在秋末时分还是翠色浓郁的后峰山下，汉村里人民委员会设立在这里。附近修有宽阔的民主宣传室，有为农民服务的诊疗所、消费合作社，有平泉郡第四中学，在平川两侧的山麓下和穿过平川的公路旁，分布着被一片片青绿色的菜地环绕着的农家。这些建筑物和村落，大多是在战后几年中恢复或新建起来的。这里的居民，战后才从隐蔽的山谷里迁移回来，重新建立了家园。在今天的和平幸福的日子里，他们并没有忘记曾经和他们一同度过了艰难岁月的志愿军。当地居民、学生和干部每年都到后峰山去祭扫烈士陵墓。
    为了纪念志愿军烈士，学校里的少年团和民主青年同盟设立了吕玉久分团和张明禄班。得过这个称号的单位的三批学生已经先后毕业了。学校的墙报取名为“金刚山”，两位烈士就是在金刚山牺牲的。墙报上面时常登载教师们和学生们写的纪念烈士的文章和诗歌，也登载学生们问候烈士亲属的信件和复信。学生们每年好几次写信到四川吕玉久的家和河南张明禄的家，向烈士的父母问候。
    在假日里，教师们有时带领学生们到金刚山游览，就地向学生们介绍烈士的光辉事迹。今年6月间，平泉郡全体少年团员特地来到汉村里过夏令营生活。他们瞻仰了烈士陵墓，到农业社访问了李好世，听她讲述自己被救的亲身经历。第四中学的学生还演出了自己根据烈士的事迹创作的歌剧。
    今天，被烈士救出的八名朝鲜妇女，一部分已经迁返故乡，或者已经结婚离开了故乡。留在当地的李好世已经是有两个孩子的母亲了。她的丈夫在去年春天从人民军复员回来，现在是农业社的作业班长。在她丈夫参军后的四年多的时间内，年老的婆婆和幼小的孩子，都依靠她一人的劳动维持生活。现在她已经成为农业社的骨干，她所在的作业班也是全社优秀的作业班之一。她在作业班中的生产成绩也很好。
    今年才十八岁的姑娘郑景南和申铉花，在被救时只有十五岁，现在，她们都参加了稼洞里的农业社，并且已经成为当地民主青年同盟组织的盟员。被救出的中年妇女崔春凤，现在是里的农民同盟委员长，她的丈夫在战时被敌人杀害，留下的两个孩子由她一人抚养。现在，她们都是劳动战线上的积极分子。她们已经实现了自己的誓言。在1953年8月22日烈士碑落成的仪式上，她们当时成立不久的生产突击队向烈士发出了如下的誓言：你们伟大的国际主义精神，永远活在我们的心里。我们保证，决不辱没你们的名字，在恢复和建设祖国的事业中永远前进。
