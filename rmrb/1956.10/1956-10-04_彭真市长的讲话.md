Mayor Peng Zhen's Speech

Respected President, esteemed Indonesian guests, comrades, friends:

Today, the people of Beijing are extremely excited and honored to be able to welcome His Excellency President Sukarno, the outstanding leader of our great neighbor, the Republic of Indonesia, and the other Indonesian guests. On behalf of the people of Beijing, I would like to extend a warm welcome and heartfelt respect to His Excellency President Sukarno and the other Indonesian guests.

President Sukarno is a good friend of the Chinese people. His visit not only brings us the deep friendship of the Indonesian people but will also greatly promote the consolidation and development of the friendly relations between our two countries. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to His Excellency the President.

The name of President Sukarno is linked to the heroic anti-colonialist struggle of the Indonesian people and to the Asian-African Conference of great historical significance. The Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the Indonesian people against colonialism. The Chinese people have the greatest respect for President Sukarno's outstanding contributions to the struggle for and maintenance of Indonesia's independence and to the struggle for and maintenance of world peace. In his opening speech at the Asian-African Conference, President Sukarno said, "Let the new Asia and the new Africa be born." This loud voice still echoes in the ears of the Chinese people, encouraging the great struggle of the Asian and African peoples against colonialism. Now the colonialists not only still occupy China's Taiwan and Indonesia's West Irian, but also try in every possible way and ferociously to restore their rule over Egypt's Suez Canal. We must continue to resolutely support the just struggle of the Egyptian people, continue to fight for the maintenance of our respective sovereignty and territorial integrity, so that colonialism cannot find a foothold on this earth. The Chinese and Indonesian peoples are comrades-in-arms fighting shoulder to shoulder in the anti-colonialist struggle. This struggle has closely linked the peoples of China and Indonesia.

In recent years, the frequent friendly exchanges between our two countries, the cordial mutual visits of representatives from the governments and parliaments, trade, culture, arts, religion, trade unions, and other sectors of the two countries have comprehensively conveyed the friendship of the people of our two countries to each other and strengthened the economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries. Therefore, when the people of Beijing welcome His Excellency the President, we do not feel that we are welcoming a stranger, but welcoming our close relatives and friends. Therefore, everyone is elated, which is by no means accidental, but a true expression of feelings. The Chinese people feel honored and happy because they have established a brotherly friendship with the Indonesian people. We will unremittingly work to further consolidate and develop the friendship between the peoples of our two countries.

Respected President, please bring the friendship of the people of Beijing and the 600 million people of China to the citizens of Jakarta and to all the people of Indonesia, so that we can support each other more closely in the struggle against colonialism and for peace, and in our respective construction undertakings, and continue to develop and consolidate the friendship between our two countries.

Long live the friendship between China and Indonesia!
Long live peace in Asia!
Long live world peace!

专栏：

    彭真市长的讲话敬爱的总统阁下，敬爱的印度尼西亚的贵宾们，同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我们北京市人民能够在这里欢迎我们伟大邻邦印度尼西亚共和国的杰出领袖苏加诺总统阁下和印度尼西亚的其他贵宾们，感到非常兴奋和光荣。我谨代表北京市人民向苏加诺总统阁下和印度尼西亚的其他贵宾们，表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意。
    苏加诺总统是我们中国人民的好朋友，他的访问，不仅给我们带来了印度尼西亚人民的深厚的友情，并且将大大地促进我们两国友好关系的巩固和发展，我们谨向总统阁下表示衷心的感谢。
    苏加诺总统的名字是同英勇的印度尼西亚人民反殖民主义的斗争联系在一起的，是同具有伟大历史意义的亚非会议联系在一起的。中国人民坚决支持印度尼西亚人民反对殖民主义的正义斗争。中国人民对于苏加诺总统为争取和维护印度尼西亚的独立和为争取和维护世界和平所作的卓越贡献怀有最大的敬意。苏加诺总统在亚非会议的开幕词中说：“让新亚洲和新非洲诞生吧”。这个洪亮的声音至今还荡漾在我们中国人民的耳边，鼓舞着亚非人民反对殖民主义的伟大斗争。现在殖民主义者不仅还在占领着中国的台湾和印度尼西亚的西伊里安，而且还在千方百计和穷凶极恶地企图恢复他们对于埃及的苏伊士运河的统治；我们必须继续坚决支持埃及人民的正义斗争、继续为维护我们各自的主权和领土完整而斗争，使殖民主义在这个地球上找不到一块立足的地方。我们中国人民同印度尼西亚人民是反殖民主义斗争中的肩并肩的战友，这种斗争已经把中国和印度尼西亚两国人民紧密地连结在一起。
    近年来我们两国之间的频繁的友好往来，两国的政府和议会，贸易、文化、艺术、宗教、工会等各界的代表的亲切的互相访问，已经比较全面地互相传达了我们两国人民的友谊，并且加强了两国的经济、文化合作关系。所以当着我们北京市的人民在欢迎总统阁下的时候，我们并不觉得是在欢迎一位陌生的人，而是在欢迎自己亲密的亲戚朋友，因而一个个都兴高彩烈，这决不是偶然的，这是一种真情的流露，我们中国人民因为同印度尼西亚人民建立了兄弟般的友谊，而感到光荣和高兴。我们将坚持不懈地为进一步巩固和发展我们两国人民的友谊而努力。
    敬爱的总统阁下，请你把我们北京市人民和全中国六亿人民的友情带给雅加达市民，带给印度尼西亚全体人民，让我们在反对殖民主义和争取和平的斗争中，在各自的建设事业中更加亲密的互相支持并且继续发展和巩固我们两国的友谊。
    中国同印度尼西亚的友谊万岁！
    亚洲和平万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
