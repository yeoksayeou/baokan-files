Small Vendors Should Not Be Discriminated Against
*People's Daily* Commentator

Since the State Council issued the "Instructions on Several Issues in the Socialist Transformation of Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises, Handicraft Industries, and Private Transportation Industries" on July 28th, various localities have actively taken effective measures to properly arrange the business operations of small vendors. However, there are still some regions that have not earnestly implemented the policy of arranging small vendors up to now, and some unreasonable, even illegal and undisciplined phenomena still exist.

In many areas of Fujian Province, the principle of state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives in allocating goods is: first state-owned, then joint ventures, then cooperative stores, and finally small vendors. As a result, many seasonal commodities are unavailable to small vendors.

Sometimes, even if small vendors can get some popular goods, they have to be matched with a batch of slow-moving, damaged, and substandard products. This matching is often bizarre. For example, the Hankou Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative sold a pound of mothballs to a small vendor and required the vendor to take five slingshots. A small vendor selling fish balls in Nanping County bought 40 catties of fresh fish from the county's aquatic products company, but the company insisted on pairing it with 100 catties of salted fish. The vendor said, "Salted fish cannot be made into fish balls." The company cadre said, "Then keep it for yourself!"

The minimum order quantity for some commodities is set too high, exceeding the operating capacity of small vendors. For example, the Jinjiang County Department Store stipulates that the minimum order quantity for sewing needles is 5,000, which cannot be sold out in half a year.

Small vendors generally have very little capital. They have always relied on "frequent purchases and quick sales" to maintain their operations. These practices of state-owned companies and supply and marketing cooperatives have created operational difficulties for small vendors, making them feel that "everyone else can walk towards socialism, but small vendors have no way to go."

Why do these bizarre things happen? The main reason is that some cadres of state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives in these areas do not fully understand the role of small vendors in commodity circulation. They believe that at present, the socialist economy has become the only important economic form, and a unified socialist economic market has been formed. In the future, there is no need to use small vendors anymore, so they try to make things difficult for, restrict, and squeeze out small vendors.

The facts are very different from what these comrades think. Small vendors are indispensable commercial laborers in rural areas. We have nearly two million small vendors in rural areas who engage in supply, procurement, and short-distance transportation, are widely distributed, close to residents, familiar with the needs of the masses, and deliver goods to their doorsteps, which is convenient for the masses to purchase and sell goods. These cannot be replaced by state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives. This mode of operation not only plays an active role in rural commodity circulation today, but is also needed for a long time to come. Organized small vendors, under the leadership of state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives, are closely linked to the socialist economy and are also part of the socialist economic system. They will work together with state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives to serve the cause of socialist construction and meet the diverse purchasing and sales needs of the broad masses of peasants. Therefore, not only should they not be discriminated against or underestimated, but they should also be practically allocated a business volume suitable for their operating capacity and the needs of the masses, according to different regions and different situations, to help them solve operating difficulties, so that they can all maintain and appropriately improve their lives. In this way, their operating enthusiasm can be brought into play, the rural economy can be better revitalized, and the needs of the broad masses of people can be met.

In order to give full play to the active role of small vendors in commodity circulation, state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives should take care of the supply of goods to small vendors. The phenomenon of forced matching should be resolutely stopped. The goods that have been matched to small vendors but have not yet been sold should be taken back, or transferred to consignment sales with the consent of the small vendors, and reasonable handling fees should be given. In some areas, state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives do not actively develop sources of supply for small vendors, but blindly restrict small vendors from developing their own sources of supply. Some state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives even forcibly detain and purchase goods acquired by vendors themselves. These phenomena should be corrected. It must be recognized that ensuring the normal operation and reasonable income of small vendors is beneficial to revitalizing the economic life of various regions, and generally speaking, it is also beneficial to socialism. We should look at this issue from a holistic perspective.

    不该歧视小商贩
    本报评论员
    自从7月28日国务院发出“关于对私营工商业、手工业、私营运输业的社会主义改造中若干问题的指示”以后，各地都积极采取有效措施，妥善地安排了小商贩的业务经营。但也有一些地区，到目前为止还没有认真地贯彻执行安排小商贩的政策，一些不合理的甚至是违法乱纪的现象仍然存在。
    福建省许多地区的国营商业和供销社分配货源的原则是：先国营，次合营，再合作商店，最后才轮到小商贩。这样一来，有许多时令商品，小商贩就进不到手了。
    有时候，小商贩即使能分到一点畅销货，也得搭配一批冷背残次品。这种搭配往往是很离奇的。例如：涵口镇供销社卖给小贩一斤樟脑丸，要搭配五支弹鸟弓。南平县一个卖鱼丸的小贩向该县水产公司买四十斤鲜鱼，公司硬要搭配一百斤咸鱼；小贩说：“咸鱼不能做鱼丸。”公司干部说：“那就留着自己吃吧！”
    某些商品的批发起点规定得太高，超过了小商贩的经营能力。例如晋江县百货公司规定缝衣针的批发起点是五千根，半年也卖不完。
    小商贩的资金一般都很少，他们一向是靠“勤进快销”来维持经营的。国营公司和供销社的这些做法，给小商贩造成了经营上的困难，使他们感到“别人都能走到社会主义，唯有小商贩无路可寻”。
    为什么会发生这种种离奇的事情？主要原因是这些地区有些国营商业和供销社的干部，对小商贩在商品流转中的作用认识不足。他们认为，目前，社会主义经济已经成为唯一重要的经济形式，统一的社会主义经济的市场已经形成，今后用不着再利用小商贩了，所以就对小商贩多方留难、限制和排挤。
    事实同这些同志的看法大不相同。小商贩是农村中不可缺少的商业劳动者。我们农村小商贩大约有将近二百万人，他们从事供应、采购和短距离运输等劳动，分布面广，接近居民，熟悉群众需要，送货上门，便利群众购销商品。这些，是国营商业、供销合作商业所不能代替的。这种经营方式不仅在今天对农村的商品流转起着积极的作用，而且也是今后长期需要的。组织起来的小商贩在国营商业、供销社的领导下，同社会主义经济密切地联系起来，也是社会主义经济体系的一部分，他们将和国营商业、供销社一道，共同为社会主义建设事业服务，为满足广大农民群众多种多样的购销需要服务。因此，不仅不应该歧视他们、轻视他们，而且应该根据不同地区、不同情况，切实地分配给他们以适合他们的经营能力和群众需要的营业额，帮助他们解决经营中的困难，使他们都能够维持和适当地改善生活。这样，才能够发挥他们的经营积极性，更好地活跃农村经济，满足广大人民的需要。
    为了充分发挥小商贩在商品流转中的积极作用，国营商业、供销社对于小商贩的货源要加以照顾，强迫搭配的现象应该切实制止，已经搭配给小商贩而尚未卖出去的货物应该收回，或者取得小商贩同意后转为代销，给予合理的手续费。某些地区国营商业和供销社既不积极开辟供应小商贩的货源，又盲目限制小商贩自己开辟货源；某些国营商业和供销社甚至强迫扣留、收购商贩自己收购到的货物；这些现象都应当纠正。必须认识：保证小商贩的正常经营和合理的收入，是对活跃各个地区的经济生活有利的，总的说来也是对社会主义有利的。我们应当从全局着眼看待这个问题。
