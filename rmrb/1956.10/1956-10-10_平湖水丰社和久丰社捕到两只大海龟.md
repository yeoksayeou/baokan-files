    Two Large Sea Turtles Caught by Shuifeng and Jiufeng Cooperatives in Pinghu
    (Our newspaper's report) Recently, members of the Shuifeng Agricultural Cooperative in Huanggu Township and the Jiufeng Agricultural Cooperative in Huangshan Township, Pinghu County, successively caught two large sea turtles. The sea turtle caught by members of the Jiufeng Cooperative weighed about 300 catties. At 1:00 PM on the 1st of this month, members of the Shuifeng Cooperative caught another large sea turtle weighing nearly 600 catties, measuring 5 feet 5 inches in length, 2 feet 6 inches in width, and 1 foot 5 inches in height, in the sea off Qinglong Port, more than 3 li from the Shuikou coast. This is slightly smaller than the large sea turtle weighing over 600 catties recently caught by the Soviet Union in the Far Eastern Sea. This sea turtle weighing nearly 600 catties is called a leatherback turtle, also known as a leathery turtle. Its carapace is slightly flattened, with seven raised longitudinal ridges, slightly concave between the ridges, black on the back, with gray spots. This type of sea turtle feeds on fish, crustaceans, shellfish, etc. During the breeding season, they gather on the coast, dig sand to lay eggs, and lay about 350 eggs each time. After hatching, the turtles enter the sea. The meat is fatty and can be used to make oil. After catching this leatherback turtle, it was exhibited locally for a short time. On the morning of the 4th, it was transported to the Hangzhou Museum by civilian vehicle. (Editorial Department of Zhejiang Pinghu Newspaper)

    平湖水丰社和久丰社捕到两只大海龟
    本报讯　最近平湖县黄姑乡水丰社、黄山乡久丰社社员，连续捕到两只大海龟。久丰社社员捕到的大海龟重达三百斤左右。本月1日下午1时，水丰社社员又在离水口海岸三里多的海面上——青龙港内，捕到一只重近六百斤的大海龟，有五尺五寸长，二尺六寸阔，一尺五寸高。这比苏联最近在远东南海捕到的重六百多斤的大海龟略为小些。这只重近六百斤的大海龟叫做棱龟，又名革龟，背甲稍扁，有直棱七条凸起，棱间微凹，背面黑色，并有灰斑点。这种海龟捕食鱼类、甲壳类、贝类等。至繁殖期，则群集海滨，掘沙产卵，每产约三百五十枚。孵化之后，龟即入海。肉多脂，可制油。捕到这只棱龟后，在当地作了短时期展览。4日晨，已用民车运往杭州博物馆。　（浙江平湖报编辑部）
