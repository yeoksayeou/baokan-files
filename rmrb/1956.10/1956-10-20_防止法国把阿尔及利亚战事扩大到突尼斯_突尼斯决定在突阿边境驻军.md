    To Prevent France from Expanding the Algerian War to Tunisia
    Tunisia Decides to Garrison Troops on the Tunisian-Algerian Border
    Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, 18th: Tunisian Secretary of State for Information, Bechir Ben Yahmed, announced at a press conference on the evening of the 17th that the Tunisian government will dispatch troops and national guards to garrison the Tunisian-Algerian border area, which has been occupied by French troops, to prevent French troops from expanding their armed conflicts with the Algerian National Liberation Army into Tunisian territory.
    Yahmed complained that after thirty-two French soldiers were wounded or killed in a battle between French troops and Algerians in the Kasserine region of Tunisian territory bordering Algeria, the French army conducted an armed search, resulting in the deaths of two Tunisian civilians and the arrest of many people.
    Yahmed said that in order to prevent similar incidents from happening again, the Tunisian government has now completely controlled the border.

    防止法国把阿尔及利亚战事扩大到突尼斯
    突尼斯决定在突阿边境驻军
    新华社18日讯　突尼斯消息：突尼斯新闻国务秘书贝格希尔·本·亚赫迈德17日晚间在记者招待会上宣布，突尼斯政府将派遣军队和国民警卫队进驻一直是由法军驻扎的突尼斯—阿尔及利亚边界地带，以防止法军把它同阿尔及利亚民族解放军之间的武装冲突扩大到突尼斯领土上。
    亚赫迈德控诉说，由于法军同阿尔及利亚人在邻接阿尔及利亚边界的突尼斯领土卡塞列那地区的战斗中有三十二个法国士兵伤亡，法军进行了武装搜索，结果使得两个突尼斯平民死亡和许多人被捕。
    亚赫迈德说，为了防止再发生类似事件，突尼斯政府现在已经完全控制了边界。
