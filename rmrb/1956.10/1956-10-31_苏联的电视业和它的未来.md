    Soviet Television Industry and Its Future
    I. Inozemtsev, Manager of Soviet Central Television

    Residents and guests of Moscow are familiar with the capital's television broadcast lattice tower, a beautiful masterpiece by Russian engineer Shukhov. Now, hundreds of thousands of television sets in the Moscow region and the city of Moscow are receiving signals from this tower. According to approximate statistics, in the entire Soviet Union, this region alone has three to three and a half million television viewers every day.

    The Moscow Television Center is located near the tower. A narrow asphalt avenue lined with lilacs leads to a small gray house. In this house, built twenty years ago, life is boiling. Initially, it was just an experimental institution, broadcasting at most two or three times a week. But now the Moscow Television Center works every day, and there are at least two experimental broadcasts every week.

    Television has penetrated the lives of Soviet people. Currently, in the Soviet Union, apart from many non-professional television centers, there are fifteen independent television centers besides the Moscow Television Center. They are distributed in cities such as Leningrad, Tallinn, Kharkov, Kiev, Sverdlovsk, and Vladivostok. This year the number of television centers will increase to twenty, and by the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan there will be at least seventy-five.

    Central Television operates on the base of the Moscow Television Center. It not only prepares programs for Muscovites, but also prepares programs for television centers in other regions.

    Not long ago, a technical conference on the construction of a huge new Moscow Television Center was held in the building under the Shukhov Tower. From the window of the room, you can see the scenery of the building under construction. This new high-rise building will have nine new broadcasting studios.

    Soviet television not only broadcasts dramas and concerts from theaters and concert halls, but also invites actors to create special television performances. Film screenings occupy a significant position in Soviet television programs. The nature of television programs can be known from the example of Central Television.

    From January to July 1956, Central Television broadcast a total of seventy dramas and operas, fifty concerts, one hundred and twenty-five feature films, and three hundred and fifty news documentaries. In addition, the television station broadcasts a television magazine "Art" with literary and artistic news and a television magazine "Young Pioneers" for school-age children every month.

    The television station frequently publicizes Chinese literature, music, painting, and drama. For example, in the program of the television magazine "Art", painters Klimashenko and ballet dancer Vlasova, who had been to China, talked about their impressions. One issue of the magazine broadcast fragments of a film about the famous Chinese Peking Opera actor Mei Lanfang. Moscow Television broadcast performances by the People's Republic of China Acrobatic Troupe, the Yue Opera Troupe's "Romance of the West Chamber" and "The Butterfly Lovers."

    Political broadcasters have special tasks. Each Soviet television station has a special political broadcasting editorial department to lead this work. This aspect of the television station's work is guided by the historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    Soviet television viewers can see Soviet and foreign political activists, scientists, and production innovators on the television screen, as well as new villages in the northern and eastern Soviet Union. Appearing on the screen are not only people, but also what people have created, such as jet planes, new "Moskvich" cars, new helicopters, and so on.

    Television stations enable the broad masses of working people to see famous events in progress. This year, hundreds of thousands of residents of Moscow and the Moscow region watched the parade on Red Square, the welcoming of Bulganin and Khrushchev upon their return from Britain, and the scene of welcoming President Tito at the Moscow Kiev Railway Station on television. This is not all, because not every viewer can be near the television when the event is taking place, so one of the regular tasks of the television station is to record the event on film for rebroadcast.

    During the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Central Television organized a series of broadcasts entitled "Innovators Speak" and "Technology in the Sixth Five-Year Plan." Recently, it broadcast talks by representatives of young people who went to the north and east to participate in construction, as well as an evening entitled "Youth Prepares to Set Out."

    In addition to the two magazines "Art" and "Young Pioneers", the television station also broadcasts a magazine called "Knowledge". The purpose of this magazine is to popularize science and advanced production achievements, especially to promote the experience of applying scientific achievements to production.

    Not long ago, the television station began broadcasting "Latest News" every day. Currently, we are doing ten minutes of text broadcasts, and in the future, with the development of our own photography work, the text broadcasts will be combined with film broadcasts.

    Therefore, it is clear that the development prospect of Soviet political television broadcasting is: through thematic broadcasting to television magazines and television newspapers. Soviet television viewers have the right to demand that their television sets be used to participate in the most important contemporary events, to see experiments in scientists' laboratories, the labor achievements of worker innovators, to watch competitions in sports fields, and many other things in our rich and colorful reality.

    There are two ways to meet the needs of Soviet television viewers: one is to further develop the work of shooting their own films, and the other is to widely use mobile television stations that can penetrate all aspects of life. Furthermore, it is also necessary to establish fixed broadcasting points in frequently broadcast places, such as the Bolshoi Theater, the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall, and the Lenin Central Stadium.

    We can imagine what the Soviet television industry will develop into in a few years, when the cultural tasks in the Sixth Five-Year Plan are completed.

    In the near future, the capital will have a Moscow Television Center with twice the capacity of the current television center and a larger broadcasting radius.

    In the future, establishing its own film laboratory, or its own "television production studio," will be able to widely and timely supply films to television centers across the country. Currently, the establishment of a special television theater is being studied, where television performances will be prepared using the television station's own strength and external forces.

    From 1958, experimental color broadcasts will begin. Modern methods will be used so that ordinary television sets can receive color broadcasts just like black and white broadcasts.

    The Sixth Five-Year Plan attaches great importance to the establishment of radio relay lines, which can not only exchange programs between television centers in the Soviet Union, but also exchange programs with neighboring people's democratic countries, and in the future, even exchange programs with many countries in Europe and Asia.

    In this five-year plan, many cities in the European part of the Soviet Union will be able to establish round-the-clock connections through radio relay lines to exchange television programs. In this way, Moscow residents with televisions can switch to broadcasts from Kiev Television after listening to a Moscow concert, or watch what is happening in Leningrad.

    There is no doubt that there will be a radio relay line connection between the European and Asian parts of the Soviet Union, and by that time, it will also be possible to exchange television programs with fraternal China to strengthen the friendship and cultural cooperation between the two peoples.

    苏联的电视业和它的未来
    苏联中央电视台经理　伊诺泽木采夫
    莫斯科的居民和客人都熟悉首都电视播送的网状高塔，这是俄罗斯工程师述霍夫的优美的杰作。现在莫斯科州和莫斯科市的几十万个电视机正在收取这个高塔发出的讯号。根据大约的统计，在全苏联，仅这个地区每天就有三百四、五十万人看电视。
    莫斯科电视中心就在高塔的近旁。一条很窄的两旁种满紫丁香的柏油林荫道，通到一所不大的灰色房屋前面。在这所二十年前修盖的房屋里，生活在沸腾着。最初，这里只是一个实验性的机构，每星期最多播送两三次。可是现在莫斯科电视中心每天都工作，此外，每星期至少还有两次实验性广播。
    电视已深入苏联人的生活。目前，在苏联不算许多非专业性的电视中心，除莫斯科电视中心外还有十五个独立的电视中心。它们分布在列宁格勒、塔林、哈尔科夫、基辅、斯维德洛夫斯克、海参崴等城市。今年电视中心要增加到二十个，到第六个五年计划末至少有七十五个。
    中央电视台在莫斯科电视中心的基地上进行工作。它不仅要为莫斯科人编节目，而且要为外地的电视中心准备节目。
    不久前，在述霍夫高塔下的房屋里举行了有关建筑巨大的新的莫斯科电视中心的技术会议。从屋里的窗口就可以看见动工兴建的建筑物的景色。在这栋新的高楼里将设有九个新的广播室。
    苏联的电视不仅从剧院和音乐厅里播送戏剧和音乐会，而且还邀请演员作专门的电视表演。电影放映在苏联电视节目里占有显著的地位。电视节目的性质从中央电视台的例子里就可以知道了。
    从1956年1月到7月，中央电视台一共播送了七十个话剧和歌剧、五十次音乐会、一百二十五部艺术影片和三百五十部新闻纪录影片。此外，电视台每月还播送一次关于文艺消息的电视杂志“艺术”和学龄儿童的电视杂志“少先队员”。
    电视台对于中国文学、音乐、绘画、戏剧方面的作品经常宣传。例如，在电视杂志“艺术”的节目里，到过中国的画家克里马申、巴蕾舞舞蹈家弗拉索娃谈了自己的印象。在一期杂志里播送了关于著名中国京剧演员梅兰芳的影片的片断，莫斯科电视台广播了中华人民共和国杂技团的表演、越剧团演的“西厢记”和“梁山伯与祝英台”。
    政治广播员有特殊的任务。苏联各电视台都有专门的政治广播编辑部领导这个工作。电视台的这方面工作以苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的历史性决议为指南。
    苏联的电视观众可以在电视机的幕上看到苏联和外国的政治活动家、科学家、生产革新者，可以看到苏联北部和东部的新村。在幕上出现的不仅是人，而且还有人所做出的东西，如喷气式飞机、新型“莫斯科人”牌汽车、新的直升飞机等等。
    电视台能使广大的劳动人民群众看见正在进行中的著名事件。今年，有几十万莫斯科人和莫斯科州的居民从电视机上看见了红场上的检阅，看见了欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫从英国回来的情况，看见了在莫斯科基辅车站上欢迎铁托总统时的场面。这还不算，因为当事件进行时并不是每个观众都能够在电视机旁边的，所以电视台的经常工作之一，就是把事件录在电影胶片上，以便再次广播。
    在苏共第二十次代表大会期间，中央电视台组织了以“革新者说”和“第六个五年计划中的技术”为题的成套的广播节目。最近，广播了前往北部和东部参加建设的青年代表的谈话，还播送了以“青年准备上路”为题的晚会。
    除了“艺术”和“少先队员”这两个杂志以外，电视台还播送一个叫“知识”的杂志。这个杂志的目的是，普及科学和先进生产成就，特别是宣传把科学成就运用到生产中的经验。
    不久以前，电视台开始每天播送“最后消息”。目前，我们作十分钟的文字广播，将来随着我们自己的摄影工作的开展，文字广播要配合电影放送。
    因此，很明显的，苏联政治性电视广播的发展前景是：通过专题播送到电视杂志和电视报纸的道路。苏联电视观众有权要求，利用他的电视机参加当代最重要的事件，看见科学家实验室中的经验，工人革新者的劳动成果，观看运动场上的比赛和我们丰富多彩的现实中的许许多多的东西。
    满足苏联电视观众的要求的途径有两条：一条是进一步发展自己拍摄电影的工作，另一条是广泛地利用能深入到生活各方面的流动电视站。再有，在经常播送的地方，如大剧院、柴可夫斯基音乐厅、列宁中央运动场等地建立固定的广播点，也是很必要的。
    我们可以想像到：将来经过几年以后，当第六个五年计划中文化方面的任务完成了的时候，苏联电视业将会发展成什么样子。
    不久的将来，在首都就能有一个比现在电视中心能力大两倍的、拥有更大的广播半径的莫斯科电视中心。
    将来，建立起自己的影片实验室，或自己的“电视制片厂”，就能够广泛地、及时地把影片供给各地的电视中心。目前，正在研究建立一个专门的电视剧院，在这里要利用电视台自己的力量和外地的力量准备电视表演节目。
    从1958年起将开始试验彩色广播。将采用现代化的方法，使普通的电视机像收黑白色广播一样地收彩色广播。
    第六个五年计划很重视无线电转播线路的设立，这样不仅能在苏联各电视中心站之间交换节目，并且能同邻近的人民民主国家交换节目，在将来，甚至还能同欧洲和亚洲许多国家交换节目。
    在这个五年计划里，苏联欧洲部分许多城市之间就能通过无线电转播线路建立起昼夜不断的连系，来交换电视节目。这样一来，有电视机的莫斯科居民在收听完莫斯科的音乐会以后，就可以转收基辅电视台的广播，或者看在列宁格勒发生的事情。
    毫无疑问，在苏联欧洲部分和亚洲部分之间将会有无线电转播线的联系，到那个时候，同兄弟的中国也能交换电视节目，以加强两国人民间的友谊和文化合作。
