    The State Council issued a directive on September 29th, requiring all regions to raise the purchase price of rapeseed and to pay attention to solving the technical problems of greatly increasing rapeseed production from the production side. The directive stated that this is "a problem that urgently needs to be solved at present." After receiving this directive, all regions should immediately announce its contents to agricultural producers' cooperatives and farmers, especially in the main rapeseed producing areas such as Sichuan, Guizhou, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Yunnan, Hubei, and Hunan, so that the purchase price ratio of rapeseed to wheat reaches an average level of 200 to 230 catties of wheat for every 100 catties of rapeseed.
    Why is it necessary to do this? This is because the supply of edible oils nationwide is currently quite tight; and rapeseed oil accounts for about one-third of the nation's edible oils, and the population that consumes rapeseed oil accounts for more than one-quarter of the nation's population. In recent years, although the purchase price ratio of rapeseed to wheat nationwide has been slightly higher than the rapeseed-to-wheat ratio before the Anti-Japanese War, the purchase price of rapeseed is still too low, and it is not enough to increase farmers' interest in producing rapeseed. Under this situation, only by raising the purchase price of rapeseed can we stimulate farmers' interest in planting rapeseed and greatly develop rapeseed production.
    In the key rapeseed producing areas of the Yangtze River Basin and other key rapeseed producing areas, raising the purchase price of rapeseed must first ensure that the income from planting one mu of rapeseed exceeds the income from planting one mu of wheat to a greater extent. Of course, this may reduce the planting area of wheat by tens of thousands of mu and increase the planting area of rapeseed by tens of thousands of mu in the main rapeseed producing areas. However, these areas are originally rapeseed producing areas. Since the Anti-Japanese War, the rapeseed planting area has been squeezed out by wheat a lot, so that even after liberation, it has not yet returned to the pre-war level. This has not only caused us many difficulties in the supply of edible oils, but also forced us to use a lot of soybeans to extract oil, thereby reducing the supply of bean-based non-staple foods in urban and rural markets. If these areas reduce wheat production in the future due to increased rapeseed production, we can also compensate for it by increasing the yield per unit area of wheat in the main wheat producing areas in the northern provinces.
    Another important method to increase rapeseed production is to actively expand the planting area of superior rapeseed varieties. "Victory Rapeseed" is one of the superior varieties; its disaster resistance ability is stronger than ordinary rapeseed, its oil content is also higher than ordinary rapeseed, and its yield per unit area is more than 50% higher than ordinary rapeseed. If this superior variety and other superior varieties are widely promoted, coupled with the increase in purchase prices, the output of rapeseed will inevitably increase rapidly. It should be noted that there are still several urgent problems to be solved in the work of promoting superior varieties. The departments in charge of key rapeseed producing areas should pay close attention to this situation and find appropriate solutions.
    The rapeseed sowing season is approaching. The leading organs in relevant areas should immediately start to organize forces to go deep into the producing areas, widely publicize the great significance of the state's increase in the rapeseed purchase price to cadres and the masses, mobilize and help farmers to expand the planting area of rapeseed as much as possible, especially superior rapeseed varieties, to ensure that rapeseed can be greatly increased in the coming year.
    Increasing rapeseed oil production can not only alleviate the tight supply of oils to a certain extent, but also use rapeseed oil to replace part of the soybean oil supply, so as to extract a considerable amount of soybeans to appropriately meet the people's needs for bean-based non-staple foods. We hope that the rural workers and the vast number of farmers in the main rapeseed producing areas will work together to implement this recent directive of the State Council.

### 国务院最近的一个指示

    国务院最近的一个指示
    国务院在9月29日发出一个指示，要求各地提高油菜籽的收购价格，并且注意从生产上解决大量增产油菜籽的技术问题。指示说这是“当前迫切需要解决的一个问题”。各地得到这个指示以后，应该立刻向农业生产合作社和农民宣布这个指示的内容，特别是在四川、贵州、浙江、安徽、江西、江苏、云南、湖北、湖南等油菜籽的主要产区，要使油菜籽同小麦的收购比价，达到平均每一百斤油菜籽相等于二百斤至二百三十斤小麦的水平。
    为什么必须这样做呢？这是因为目前全国食用油脂的供应是相当紧张的；而菜油却占全国食用油脂的三分之一左右，吃菜油的人口也占全国人口的四分之一以上。几年来，全国油菜籽收购价格同小麦收购价格的比价，虽然已经略高于抗日战争以前油菜籽同小麦的比价；但是油菜籽收购价格还是偏低了，它不足以提高农民生产油菜籽的兴趣。在这种情况下，只有提高油菜籽的收购价格，才能刺激农民种植油菜籽的兴趣，才能大量发展油菜籽的生产。
    在长江流域油菜籽重点产区及其它一些油菜籽重点产区，提高油菜籽的收购价格，首先就是要使种一亩油菜籽的收益在较大的程度上超过种一亩小麦的收益。当然，这样可能在油菜籽主要产区减少若干万亩小麦的播种面积，增加若干万亩油菜籽的播种面积。但是这些地区本来就是油菜籽产区，抗日战争以来油菜籽播种面积被小麦挤掉很多，以致解放以后还远没有恢复到战前的水平。这不仅曾经使我们在食用油脂的供应上遇到了许多困难，而且还曾经使我们不得不用很多大豆来榨油，以致减少了城乡市场上豆制副食品的供应。这些地区如果今后因为增产油菜籽而减少了小麦产量，我们还可以在北方各省小麦主要产区用提高小麦单位面积产量的办法来弥补。
    增加油菜籽产量的另一个重要方法是积极扩大优良的油菜品种的播种面积。“胜利油菜”是优良品种之一；它的抗灾能力比一般油菜籽强，含油率也比一般菜籽高，单位面积产量比一般菜籽高50％以上。如果大量推广这个优良品种和其它一些优良品种，再加上收购价格的提高，必然能使菜籽的产量迅速增长。应当注意的是：在推广优良品种的工作上，现时还有若干急待解决的问题。油菜籽重点产区的主管部门应当切实关心这方面的情况，找出妥善的解决办法。
    油菜籽播种季节就要到来了。有关地区的领导机关，应当立即着手组织力量，深入产区，向干部和群众广泛宣传国家提高油菜籽收购价格的重大意义，动员和帮助农民尽可能地扩大油菜籽特别是油菜籽优良品种的播种面积，以保证油菜籽在明年能够大量增产。
    增产菜油不但可以在一定程度上缓和油脂供应的紧张情况，而且可以用菜油代替一部分豆油供应，以便抽出相当数量的大豆，适当地满足人民对豆制副食品的需要。我们希望油菜籽主要产区的农村工作人员和广大农民共同努力实现国务院最近的这一个指示。
