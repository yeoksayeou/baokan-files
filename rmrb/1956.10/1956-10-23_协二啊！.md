Xie Er, ah!
Japan, Hokkaido, Nagasaki Miyoko

    Xie Er, ah, Xie Er! Forgive me! Don't blame this irresponsible mother who accidentally dropped you from the swaying, bumping car because your mother was too tired, Xie Er. Moving from canteen to canteen, winding through the mountain roads, you fell from the car and died! Such a small body, where did so much blood come from? So much blood flowed from the dead Xie Er! If only Mom had held you tighter... Ah, Xie Er, forgive me! Your life was too short, too tragic. Whenever I think of you, Mom can't suppress the sorrow and anger in her heart. Why are there so many children in Japan who are as unfortunate as you? It is for these children that Mom must muster the courage to tell you honestly. Listen quietly, Xie Er. Mom was pregnant with you in that small, dark house in Kawasaki. Originally, I didn't want to give birth to you, because I saw through the future of life, but I couldn't raise the money to find a doctor. Mom took her five-year-old and three-year-old children to her grandmother's house in Hokkaido. It was to give birth to you, Xie Er. To give birth to you, Mom hesitated again and again, what a difficult world this is! Poor you were born not long after Dad moved from Kawasaki, and then went to Ashibetsu to find work. But in the desolate mining area, where was there work? Dad had to become a peddler and pick coal. There was no money for bathing, so we fetched water in a bucket to wash you, but this kind of life didn't last long, and even that small house was bought by the city government. We were driven out, ah, Xie Er. Since then, we borrowed a small room, put you in an apple crate, and cut beans and grass, using the only money given by the farmers, barely making preparations for winter. In the cold, shivering mornings, Dad selected the purchased wool scraps and took them to town to sell, earning a little money to buy a small amount of grain, and also make tomorrow's car fare. Sometimes Dad drank all the car fare and returned home empty-handed. Sitting on the lap of Mom, who was arguing loudly with him, you also cried, Xie Er, but even so, you grew to be three years old. In order to knit a woolen sweater for you this year, Mom followed Dad to the mountain to work as a cook, cooking rice in the large rice pot of the mine. After washing the dishes and heating the bath boiler, 〔Note〕 in the leaky dining hall, you were in Mom's arms, Xie Er, afraid of the people fighting after drinking, often crying. You loved to sit in Mom's arms on this car, but little did you know that you would die on this car! Your name, Xie Er, was originally taken to mean that you and your brother should cooperate and struggle. Little did I know it would all be in vain, you will never come back! Mom is thinking: In order to create a world where children can be raised safely, we must rise up and fight! Forgive Mom for being weak in the past, little victim, ah, Xie Er!

〔Note〕The bathhouse where miners bathe. Japanese bathhouses are very large, everyone bathes together, and the boiler for heating the water is outside the bathhouse, a large bath boiler that heats while bathing. (Translator)

    协二啊！
    日本　北海道　长崎美代子协二啊，协二！饶恕我！别埋怨这个不负责的妈妈，从摇摆颠簸的车上，失手把你跌下了，因为妈妈太累了啊，协二。由饭堂到饭堂，辗转在山道上，从车上颠下去，把你跌死了！这么小的身体，哪来的那么多的血？从跌死的协二，流出那末多的血！假如妈妈紧紧抱住你……啊，协二，饶恕我！你的一生太短，太悲惨了。一想起你，妈妈就压不住心头的悲哀和愤怒。同你一样不幸的孩子，为什么在日本那末多？就是为了这些孩子们，妈妈也要鼓足勇气，老实告诉你。静静地听啊，协二。妈妈怀你的时候，是在川崎那小而黑暗的家。原是不想生下的，为的看透了生活的前途，只是筹不到钱，不能找医生。妈妈带着五岁和三岁的孩子，到北海道的外婆家。为的是来生你啊，协二。为了生你，妈妈曾经踌躇再三，这是多么苦难的世界啊！可怜生下来不久，爸爸也从川崎搬了来，又为找工作，到芦别去了。可是萧条的矿区，哪儿有工作？爸爸只好当小贩，拣煤炭去了。没有洗澡的钱，就打水在桶里给你洗，可是这样的生活也不长，那末小的房子，也给市府收买了。我们被赶出来了啊，协二。从此辗转借了个小房，把你放在苹果箱里，割豆又割草，用农家给的仅有的钱，勉强作了冬天的准备。在冷得令人缩瑟的早晨，爸爸把买来的羊毛屑选好拿到镇上卖，赚来一点点钱，买了少许粮食，还作了明天的车钱。有时爸爸喝光了所有的车钱，空手回到家里来。坐在高声和他争吵的妈妈的膝盖上，你也哭了，协二，可是就是这样，你也长到三岁了。为了想在今年，给你们打件毛线衣，妈妈跟着爸爸一道，上山当了烧饭婆，在矿山的大饭锅，妈妈烧着饭。洗完了碗，烧澡锅，　〔注〕在漏雨的饭场里，你在妈妈的怀中，协二，惧怕酒后打架的人们，经常地哭泣。你爱在妈妈的怀中，坐这车子来，哪里知道自己就死在这车上！你的名字呀，协二，原是为要你和哥哥，协力斗争而取的。哪里知道一场空，你再不回来了！妈妈正在想：为了创造能够平安养育孩子的世界，必须起来斗争！饶恕妈妈过去力量小吧，小小的牺牲者啊，协二！
