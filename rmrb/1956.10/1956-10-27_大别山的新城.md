The New City of Dabie Mountain
Li Han

We woke from a swaying sleep and found that the car had driven into a lush valley. After the car went around a few sharp bends on the steep mountainside, the new city of Dabie Mountain – Meishan – was in sight.

Row upon row of new buildings constantly appeared before us, and the huge arch dam stood towering far away in the middle of the Meishan peaks. This Meishan Reservoir arch dam, which surpasses the world's highest Bartolometo Dam (USA) in height, is one of the most magnificent achievements in China's current water conservancy projects and the pride of the people on both sides of the Huai River. The Meishan Reservoir was built on top of some old villages and towns, and the ancient Jinzhai county seat disappeared from the map in this way. However, the people of the old revolutionary base area, with their revolutionary tradition, built a new city – Meishan – with their own hands in another place. Today, the Jinzhai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Jinzhai County People's Committee, which lead the people of the entire county in socialist construction, are located here.

I made a tour of this new city. The new city, composed of four neat parts – the Hedong cultural and educational district, the city center, the industrial district, and the sanatorium district (reservoir management district) – lies quietly in the Meishan Valley as a whole. The construction of the mountain city is proceeding actively after the completion of the reservoir project. In the city center area on the flat land on the west bank of the Shi River, eight roads are being built. The two office buildings of the county leading organs and some other buildings have been completed. The newly completed County People's Hospital has doubled the number of beds compared to when it was in Jinzhai. The Meishan Hydropower Station, which will be completed next year, will supply Meishan with cheap electricity.

After the completion of the reservoir, the shipping conditions on the upper and lower reaches of the Shi River have been greatly improved. In addition, the Liu'an-Meishan highway, which is unimpeded by rain, has made Meishan increasingly one of the distribution markets for the special products of the eastern foot of the Dabie Mountains. In the first half of this year, the county supply and marketing cooperative purchased 217,000 jin of spring cocoons and transported them to Liu'an; it purchased 300,000 jin of cork and a large amount of timber for construction and mining, which were transported to Hefei and Huainan respectively. The famous Dabie Mountain specialties: tung oil, tea, Poria cocos, musk, and fur such as otter, fox, and leopard, are also transferred to all parts of the country through Meishan. According to comrades from the County People's Committee, a highway from Meishan to Songziguan on the border of Anhui and Hubei is currently under construction. This highway runs through the five districts of Jinzhai County, with a total length of 97 kilometers. After the entire line is opened to traffic next year, it will be more convenient to develop the resources of the Dabie Mountains and transport the local specialties.

Due to the large amount of special products being transported out and the development of agricultural production, the Meishan market presents a prosperous scene. At daybreak, bustling farmers filled the market. After the county-level organs moved to Meishan last year, five specialized companies were established to supply the people with daily necessities and other necessities of life. According to last year's statistics, the county's social purchasing power increased by nearly doubled compared to 1952. The sales volume of cotton cloth in 1955 was more than three times that of 1952, and it increased again in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year.

In addition to state-owned enterprises and handicrafts, there are 193 industrial and commercial households in the whole of Meishan, and their average daily turnover reaches 1,860 yuan. The mountain people who were almost isolated from the outside world in the past can now eat kelp from the Yellow Sea, fish, southern fruits, and use industrial products from Shanghai. A large amount of iodine-containing food is transported in, and the mountain people's goiter (thyroid enlargement) has also been greatly reduced.

At present, the population of the mountain city has reached 6,000, which is twice as many as the ancient city of Jinzhai. According to the propaganda minister of the Jinzhai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, within a few years, this new city can develop to 15,000 people. Mapu, another town in Jinzhai County that will be submerged by the Xianghongdian Reservoir under construction, most of its industrial, commercial households and residents will also move to Meishan next year. At the same time, many small and medium-sized factories and processing plants will be built in Meishan. The mountainous area produces fifteen kinds of paper-making raw materials, which is a favorable condition for building a paper mill. Near the arch dam, not far from the reservoir management office building and the beautiful hotel, there will also be a sanatorium.

    大别山的新城
    力罕
    我们从摇摆的沉睡中醒来，发现汽车已经驶进了林木葱郁的峡谷。汽车在陡峭的山腰里回旋了几个急弯，大别山的新城——梅山在望了。
    一排排的新建筑不断在我们面前出现，巨大的连拱坝远远地耸立在梅山群峰中间。这个高度赛过世界上最高的巴脱雷脱水坝（美国）的梅山水库连拱坝，是目前我国水利工程中的最辉煌的成就之一，它是淮河两岸人民的骄傲。梅山水库修建在过去的一些旧的村庄、城镇上面，古老的金寨县城，就这样在地图上消失了。但是，这里具有革命传统的老根据地人民，在另一个地方用双手兴建了一座新城——梅山。如今，领导全县人民进行社会主义建设的中共金寨县委会、金寨县人民委员会就设在这里。
    我在这个新城作了一次巡礼。新城以整齐的四部分——河东文教区、市中心区、工业区、疗养区（水库管理区）组成一个整体，宁静地躺在梅山峡谷之中。山城的建设，继水库工程完工之后正积极进行。在史河西岸平坦地带的市中心区，正在修筑八条马路。县领导机关的两座办公大楼及其他一些建筑已经建成。刚刚落成的县人民医院，病床比在金寨时增加了一倍。明年完工的梅山水电站，它将廉价供给梅山所需的电力。
    水库建成以后，史河上下游的航运条件大大改善了，加上阴雨无阻的六安——梅山公路，使梅山日益成为大别山东麓特产的集散市场之一。今年上半年，县供销合作社便收购了二十一万七千斤春茧运往六安；收购了三十万斤栓皮及大批建筑采矿用木材，分别运向合肥市和淮南市。闻名全国的大别山土特产：桐油、茶叶、伏苓、麝香及水獭、狐、豹等毛皮，也有不少是通过梅山转运到全国各地。据县人民委员会同志谈，有一条从梅山通往皖鄂交界松子关的公路，目前正在修筑。这条公路贯通金寨县的五个区，总长九十七公里，明年全线通车后，开发大别山资源，运出土特产就更加方便了。
    由于土特产大量运出和农业生产的发展，梅山市场呈现一片繁荣景象。天一亮，熙熙攘攘的农民就挤满了市场。县级机关去年迁来梅山后，成立了五个专业公司，供应人民日用百货和其他生活必需品。据去年的统计，全县社会购买力就比1952年提高了将近一倍。1955年一年的棉布销售量，比1952年多三倍以上，今年上半年比去年同期又有增加。
    全梅山除了国营企业及手工业外，有工商户一百九十三家，他们每日平均营业额达一千八百六十元。过去几乎同外界隔离的山区人民，现在也能吃到黄海的海带，鱼类、南方的水果和使用上海的工业品了。含碘质的食品大量运入，山区人民的粗脖子病（甲状腺肿大）也大大减轻。
    目前，山城的人口已达六千人，比古老的金寨城多了一倍。据中共金寨县委宣传部长谈，在几年以内，这个新城可以发展到一万五千人。将要被正在兴建的响洪甸水库淹没的金寨县另一镇市——麻埠，其中大部分工商户和居民也都要在明年迁来梅山。同时，许多中小型工厂、加工厂将在梅山兴建。山区出产十五种造纸原料，这是建设造纸厂的有利条件。在连拱坝附近、距水库管理处大楼及美丽的宾馆不远，还将有一所疗养院出现。
