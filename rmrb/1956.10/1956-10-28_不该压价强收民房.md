    It is Wrong to Forcefully Buy Civilian Housing at a Reduced Price
    I used to be an employee of the Liaoyuan Locomotive Depot. My family has a total of nine people, and we had little housing, making living very difficult. Last year, when the higher authorities called for self-construction with public assistance to solve the housing problem, I responded by borrowing 250 yuan from the public and raising more than 200 yuan myself. I finally built two rooms last October. Only two months after the house was built, the Liaoyuan Locomotive Depot was ordered to be abolished.
    In April of this year, I was transferred to the DahuoFang Reservoir for work according to instructions from higher authorities. In order to repay the loan, our whole family saved money during this period and managed to repay 75 yuan of the debt, but we still owe more than 90 yuan. Unexpectedly, in August of this year, the Meihekou Locomotive Depot sent someone to Liaoyuan to forcibly buy our house, which cost 470 yuan to build, for an assessed price of 270 yuan. After hearing this news, I cried sadly. I really feel that I can no longer endure it. What policy is the Meihekou Locomotive Depot's approach based on? We hope that the relevant departments will quickly investigate and correct it. Sun Fuyun

    不该压价强收民房
    我原是辽源机务段的职工。我家一共九口人，房子少，居住非常困难。去年上级号召自建公助解决住房问题的时候，我就响应，向公家贷款二百五十元，自己再筹二百多元，终于在去年10月份盖起了两间房子。房子盖好以后只有两个月的时间，辽源机务段奉命撤销了。
    今年4月间我奉上级指示转业到大伙房水库工作。为了偿还贷款，在这期间，我们全家省吃俭用，才算还上七十五元的债务，至今仍欠债九十多元。不料今年8月份梅河口机务段竟派人到辽源把我们花了四百七十块钱盖的房子，评价二百七十块钱强行收买了。我听了这个消息以后，曾伤心地哭了一场。我实在感到再也不能忍受了。梅河口机务段这种作法，究竟是根据什么政策？我们希望有关部门赶快调查纠正。　孙福运
