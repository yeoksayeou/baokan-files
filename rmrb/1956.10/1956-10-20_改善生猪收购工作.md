To improve hog procurement work

Yao Huibin, Director of the First Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce
Jiang Guangdong, Manager of China Food Company

In recent years, state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives have engaged in large-scale hog procurement and marketing across the country, achieving certain successes in ensuring the supply of meat in the domestic market, stabilizing the prices of non-staple foods, and ensuring the country's export needs. Some work has also been done in implementing assigned breeding and procurement methods, implementing a policy of high quality and good prices, improving procurement specifications, and simplifying procurement procedures. However, there are still many serious shortcomings and errors in hog procurement work. There are still shortcomings of being unevenly heavy and forced in assigned procurement work, especially in the implementation of procurement specifications, and there are even phenomena such as downgrading, price gouging, and illegal deductions. Therefore, improving the shortcomings and problems existing in hog procurement work is an important task to further strengthen the relationship between the state and farmers.

The purpose of implementing assigned breeding is to align farmers' pig breeding plans with the country's production plan and to promote hog production in a planned manner. The purpose of implementing assigned procurement is to reasonably allocate the supply of fat pigs and strengthen the planning of purchasing and sales. Therefore, in assigned procurement work, the following principles must be strictly observed: First, the principle of democratic evaluation and voluntary assignment. Second, the proportion of the state's annual procurement of fat pigs should be stipulated based on the local production situation, the consumption habits of the masses, and the size of the state's operating tasks (including external transfer and local supply) by district or township; the remaining part should be freely disposed of by the masses; the state will not increase purchases for the increased production of the masses, but the state operating department should still purchase if the farmers request to sell. Third, the purchasing unit must have both purchases and sales, and cannot only purchase without selling. It should supply the needs of the local people according to the plan, especially during the New Year and festivals (including mass temple fairs). In order to take care of the meat consumption of assigned hog procurement households, a certain amount of pork must be reserved for assigned procurement households; or they can purchase it with priority with the assigned procurement certificate.

In hog procurement work, the issue that has more problems and affects the relationship between the state and farmers is how to rationally formulate and correctly implement hog procurement specifications. The hog procurement specifications currently implemented in various places can be divided into the following four categories:

Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Anhui and other provinces use the method of "determining grades according to weight per catty and pricing by gross weight." This method is simple to calculate, easy for farmers to understand, and there is no technicality in the procurement; its disadvantage is that it cannot correctly implement the policy of high quality and good prices, and it will also stimulate some selfish and self-interested farmers to feed fat pigs into "overfed big-bellied" pigs for sale. For example, a fat pig weighing 135 catties should be a fourth-grade pig according to Hubei Province's standards. If it is fed 20 catties of feed before selling, it can be sold as a second-grade pig, so one pig can be sold for seven or eight yuan more. In 1954, the loss of hogs operated by the Hunan Provincial Food Company due to the weight loss of "overfed" pigs reached 5.92 million catties.

The procurement methods used in Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan, Guizhou, Zhejiang and other provinces are: "Regardless of the gross weight, only estimate the weight of meat with bones, and grade and price according to the weight of the meat." The advantage of this method is that the price is high for more meat and low for less meat, which is conducive to promoting improved varieties and improving feeding management. However, this method is purely based on visual observation and manual groping, and there is no scientific standard for grading and pricing, and it is not convenient for farmers to supervise the procurement personnel, so it is easy to cause the malpractice of downgrading and price gouging.

Jiangsu Province is "determining grades according to fatness, grading according to meat yield, and pricing by gross weight." This method implements the principle of high quality and good prices, and it is also easy to combine procurement specifications with export specifications, which is conducive to promoting farmers to raise more fat pigs; however, this method is more complicated than the above-mentioned second type of method and is not easy to master.

The fourth category is the method of "grading according to meat yield and pricing by gross weight." Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jilin and other 14 provinces and cities use this method. This method can not only implement the principle of high quality and good prices, stimulate farmers to improve feeding methods and select good breeds; at the same time, it can basically solve the problem of "overfed big-bellied pigs", because grading is determined according to the level of meat yield. If you feed too much, the meat yield will decrease, and if you don't feed, the meat yield can be increased. The difficulty in implementing this method is that it is not easy to estimate the meat yield completely accurately.

All kinds of specifications have their advantages and disadvantages, but according to the practice in various places, the fourth type of method is better. Although certain errors may still occur in grading with this method, the errors can be reduced to a minimum. According to the re-examination of procurement by the Shunyi County Food Company in Hebei Province, the number of hogs procured that were too high or too low accounted for 1.67% of the total in the first quarter of this year, and it has dropped to 1.48% in the second quarter. We hope that areas that have already implemented this method should continue to implement it, and strive to improve technology and reduce errors; areas that have not yet implemented this method can create conditions and strive to implement it as early as possible.

It must be pointed out here that some procurement personnel do not accurately estimate the amount of meat, not because there are technical difficulties, but because they intentionally downgrade and price gouge, causing farmers to suffer losses. For example, the operating style of the food companies in Jiexiu and Zuoquan counties in Shanxi Province, which was exposed by the Dagongbao on July 2, 1956, was very bad. For example, when the Zuoquan County Food Company initially purchased hogs, the procurement prices and determined grades were relatively reasonable in order to establish "credibility". After establishing "credibility", they intentionally underestimated the meat yield and lowered the grade of hogs. Similar situations also exist in other regions. The reason for this phenomenon is that, on the one hand, food companies have developed rapidly in recent years, and the number of personnel has increased a lot, and the business level cannot keep up with the needs, and the policy education for newly absorbed butchers, pig dealers and other employees is relatively poor; on the other hand, in the first half of this year, we praised the units that completed the task of turning over profits too much, which also contributed to the development of a one-sided view of national profits in some units, ignoring the interests of farmers. Therefore, we must constantly strengthen the policy and ideological education of employees, so that all employees understand that the task of completing the task of turning over profits should be achieved by accelerating capital turnover, reducing unnecessary losses, and reducing expenses, rather than obtaining unreasonable profits by harming the interests of farmers.

In addition, in the past, many grass-roots procurement units refused to purchase fat pigs and sick pigs that did not meet the procurement specifications. This practice is inappropriate. Farmers sell fat pigs that do not meet the procurement specifications, some because the feed cannot be solved, and some because they are in urgent need of funds. In short, this is "a last resort". Procurement personnel should sympathize with the farmers' difficulties and try their best to help them overcome the difficulties so that they can continue to raise them; if the farmers still insist on selling, we should deal with them appropriately according to the situation. Pigs that are close to the procurement starting point can be purchased according to the principle of pricing according to quality. As for the fat pigs and small and medium-sized pigs sold by farmers in disaster areas that do not meet the procurement specifications, state-owned food companies must purchase them. For this part of the hogs that do not meet the specifications, some can be slaughtered and supplied locally to meet market needs; some need to be fed for a short period of time; small and medium-sized pigs can be sold to farmers and agricultural cooperatives in non-disaster areas to continue raising. For pigs with minor illnesses that farmers request to sell, the procurement unit should assist the farmers in treating them, or the food company can slaughter them on behalf of the farmers and handle them in accordance with the regulations of the health inspection department. In short, we should help farmers overcome difficulties and cannot refuse to purchase them across the board.

Strengthening publicity and education to farmers is also of great significance to improving the relationship between the state and farmers in hog procurement. We must widely explain the hog procurement specifications to the farmers so that the farmers can sell pigs that meet the specifications, and it is also convenient to supervise the procurement personnel and prevent the phenomenon of downgrading and price gouging from continuing to occur.

    改善生猪收购工作
    商业部第一局局长　姚会宾
    中国食品公司经理　蒋光东
    几年来，国营商业部门和供销合作社，在全国范围内从事大规模的生猪收购和运销工作，对保证国内市场肉食供应和稳定副食品的价格，对保证国家出口需要，都取得了一定的成绩；在收购工作中实行派养派购办法，贯彻优质优价政策，改进收购规格和简化收购手续等方面，也作了一些工作。但是，在生猪收购工作中，仍然存在不少严重的缺点和错误。在派购工作中仍有畸轻畸重和硬派的缺点，特别是在收购规格的执行中，甚至还存在压级压价、非法克扣等现象。因此，改善生猪收购工作中存在的缺点和问题，是进一步密切国家与农民间关系的一项重要工作。
    实行派养，目的在于使农民养猪计划与国家生产计划一致起来，有计划地促进生猪生产。实行派购，目的在于合理地分配肥猪货源，加强购销计划性。因此，在派购工作中，必须切实遵守以下原则：一、民主评议，自愿认派的原则。二、按区或乡为单位，根据当地生产情况、群众消费习惯，国家经营任务（包括外调和就地供应）的大小，规定国家全年收购肥猪的比例；其余部分由群众自由处理；群众增产部分，国家不增购，但农民要求出售的，国家经营部门仍应予以收购。三、收购单位必须有购有销，不能只收不销，应该按照计划供应当地人民的需要，特别是在过年过节（包括群众性的庙会节日）时，更要做好供应工作。为了照顾派购生猪户的吃肉问题，对派购户必须留给一定数量的猪肉；或者凭派购证可以优先购买。
    在生猪收购工作中存在问题较多、影响国家与农民关系较大的是，如何合理制定与正确执行生猪收购规格的问题。目前各地执行的生猪收购规格，可以分以下四类：
    湖北、湖南、江西、四川、安徽等省是采用“按斤重定等，毛斤计价”的办法。这种办法计算简便、农民易懂，收购中没有技术性；它的缺点是不能正确贯彻优质优价政策，同时也会刺激一部分自私自利的农民将肥猪喂成“饱食大肚”猪出售。比如：一头一百三十五斤重的肥猪，按湖北省的标准应该是四等猪，如果出售时喂上二十斤食，就可以按二等猪出售，这样一头猪可以多卖七、八元。1954年湖南省食品公司所经营的生猪，仅因“饱肚”猪掉秤损耗达五百九十二万斤。
    山西、内蒙、云南、贵州、浙江等省采用的收购办法是：“不管毛斤重量，只估计带骨肉的重量，并按肉的重量分等作价”。这个办法的好处是，出肉多售价高，出肉少售价低，有利于促进改良品种和改善饲养管理。但这个办法纯系用肉眼观察和用手揣摸，没有一个分等计价的科学标准，农民也不便对收购人员进行监督，因而容易发生压级压价的弊病。
    江苏省是“按膘肥定等、按出肉率定级、按毛斤计价”。这个办法贯彻了优质优价的原则，同时便于把收购规格与出口规格结合起来，有利于促进农民多养肥猪；但是这个办法比以上第二类办法更复杂，不易掌握。
    第四类是“按出肉率分等，以毛斤计价”的办法。河北、山东、河南、吉林等十四个省市采用这个办法。这个办法既能贯彻优质优价的原则，刺激农民改善饲养方法和选择良种；同时，基本上也可以解决“饱食大肚猪”的问题，因为分等是根据出肉率的高低来确定，喂食多了出肉率会降低，不喂食出肉率可提高。执行这个办法的困难是估计出肉率不易做到完全准确。
    各类规格，各有利弊，但根据各地实践证明，以第四类的办法比较好。虽然这种办法在定等时还可能出现一定的差误，但差误可以减少到最小限度。据河北省顺义县食品公司收购复验，今年第一季度收购生猪偏高或偏低的占总数1.67％，第二季度已降为1.48％。我们希望已经执行此项办法的地区，应该继续执行，力求提高技术，减少差错；目前还没有执行这项办法的地区，可以创造条件争取提早执行。
    这里必须指出，有的收购人员对出肉量估的不准，并不是技术上有困难，而是有意的压级压价，让农民吃亏。如1956年7月2日大公报揭发的山西省介休、左权等县食品公司的经营作风是十分恶劣的。如左权县食品公司在开初收购生猪的时候，为了建立“信誉”，他们规定的收购价格和确定的等级都是比较合理的，当建立了“信誉”之后，就有意少估出肉率，降低生猪的等级。类似情况在其他地区也是有的。产生这种现象的原因，一方面是：几年来食品公司发展的快，人员增加很多，业务水平赶不上需要，而且对新吸收的屠商、猪贩及其他职工的政策教育做的较差；另一方面是，今年上半年我们对完成上缴利润任务的单位表扬过多，这也助长了某些单位产生片面的国家利润观点，把农民的利益忽视了。因此，必须不断加强职工的政策思想教育，使所有职工都懂得完成上缴利润任务，应该从加速资金周转，减少不应有的损耗，降低费用等方面来实现，而不应该从损害农民利益来获取不合理的利润。
    此外，过去许多基层收购单位对于不合收购规格的肥猪和病猪一律拒收，这种做法是不妥当的。农民将不合收购规格的肥猪出售，有的由于饲料无法解决，有的由于急需款项，总之，这是出于“不得已而为之”。采购人员应该同情农民的困难，尽量帮助他们克服困难，使他们能够继续喂养；如果农民仍然坚持出售，我们就应该分别情况予以适当处理。接近收购起点的猪，可以根据按质论价的原则，予以收购。至于灾区农民出售的不合收购规格的肥猪和中小猪，国营食品公司必须予以收购。对于这部分不合规格的生猪，有的可以屠宰后就地供应市场需要；有的需要加以短期喂养；中小猪可以出售给非灾区农民和农业社继续饲养。对于农民要求出售的有轻微病症的猪，收购单位应该协助农民医治，也可由食品公司代宰，按卫生检验部门规定办理。总之，应该帮助农民克服困难，不能一律拒绝收购。
    加强对农民的宣传教育，对改善国家与农民在生猪收购方面的关系也有重大的意义。必须把生猪收购规格广泛地向农民交代清楚，使农民售猪能合乎规格，同时也便于对收购人员进行监督，防止压级压价的现象继续发生。
