    Please Supply Us with Machine Parts
    The Geological Exploration Team of the Huai River Harnessing Committee's Survey and Design Institute has eight 12-horsepower diesel engines. Their working efficiency is very good, but after a certain period, parts like piston rings, pistons, cylinder liners, fuel injector tips, and fuel pump cores need to be replaced. In the past, these parts were supplied by the Wusong Diesel Engine Factory in Shanghai, but later they were produced by the Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory in Jiangxi Province. However, the Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory has stopped supplying them this year. Now, our eight 12-horsepower diesel engines cannot guarantee full operation. The six or seven drilling machines we bought from the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory are also frequently affecting production because they lack parts and cannot be repaired when they break down. We hope that the Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory and the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory will produce some spare parts while manufacturing complete machines, so as to avoid the machines becoming idle when they break down.　Wei Jiahui

    请供给我们机器零件
    治淮委员会勘测设计院地质勘探大队有八部十二匹马力的柴油机。它们的工作效能很好，只是到一定时间就得换一换涨圈、活塞、缸套、油尖头、油泵芯子等零件。过去，这些零件都由上海吴淞柴油机厂供给，后来改由江西省南昌柴油机厂生产。可是南昌柴油机厂今年就不供应了。现在，我们的八部十二匹马力的柴油机已不能保证全部运转。我们从太原矿山机器厂买来的六、七部钻探机，也是因为没有零件，机器出了毛病无法修理而常常影响生产。我们希望南昌柴油机厂和太原矿山机器厂在生产装备整齐的机器的同时，也生产一些零件，以免机器坏了闲置起来。　魏家祜
