    The Money from Selling a Fattened Pig Isn't Enough to Buy a Weaner Pig
    On September 7th, the Great Agricultural Cooperative of Zhaiwan Township, Sui County, Hubei Province, took six large fattened pigs (weighing over 800 jin) to the food company and sold them for 216 yuan. They planned to use this money to buy six weaner pigs. After calculating the cost, buying six weaner pigs (about 480 jin) would cost 240 yuan (not including commissions), requiring an additional 24 yuan. As a result, the purchase was not made. The Friendship Cooperative of Wufeng Township sold a fattened pig weighing 120 jin for 32.40 yuan, but buying a weaner pig weighing 68 jin (at 0.50 yuan per jin) cost 34 yuan. Including the commission of 1.55 yuan, the total cost was 35.55 yuan. Selling a fattened pig and buying a weaner pig resulted in a deficit of 3.15 yuan. Because raising fattened pigs is unprofitable, the masses have sold their weaner pigs. It is unreasonable that the masses raise pigs for several months, fatten them, and then find that the money from selling the fattened pigs isn't enough to buy weaner pigs. It is understood that this situation is widespread and urgently needs to be inspected and resolved by relevant departments.  Wán Mù

    卖一口肉猪的钱买不了一口槽子猪
    9月7日，湖北省随县砦塆乡伟大农业社，赶了六口大肉猪（重八百多斤）到食品公司卖了二百一十六元，他们准备用这笔钱再买六口槽子猪。一算账，买六口槽子猪（约四百八十斤）要用二百四十元（佣钱还不算），还得倒找二十四元，结果未买成。五凤乡友谊社一口一百二十斤重的肉猪卖了三十二元四角，买了一口重六十八斤的槽子猪（每斤五角）却花了三十四元，加上佣钱一元五角五分，共计三十五元五角五分，卖一口肉猪再买一口槽子猪倒找出三元一角五分。由于喂肉猪划不来，所以群众把槽子猪都卖了。群众喂猪几个月，把槽子猪喂成肉猪，卖了肉猪还买不回槽子猪，这是很不合理的。据了解这种情况是普遍存在的，急需有关方面检查解决。  汍木
