White Wax Harvest

Emei is not only famous throughout the country for the beauty of Mount Emei, but also for its abundant production of white wax, known both domestically and internationally. This year, the county has developed over one million wax trees, with approximately 500,000 trees bearing wax. The county's wax farmers have all been organized, effectively strengthening the protection of wax insects. Furthermore, the wax-bearing trees have not been damaged by typhoons or other natural disasters, so the wax flowers are growing particularly well this year. The entire county is expected to increase white wax production by around 50,000 jin.

    白蜡丰收
    峨嵋，不仅以峨嵋山的秀丽闻名全国，同时，它还以盛产白蜡闻名于国内外。今年全县的蜡树已发展到一百多万株，约有五十万株蜡树挂上了蜡。全县蜡农都已组织起来，有力的加强了对蜡虫的保护工作，再加上蜡树挂蜡后没有遭到暴风雨等自然灾害的侵袭，所以今年的蜡花长得特别好。全县将可增产白蜡五万斤左右。
