Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, October 30th: The first generating unit of the Shizitan Hydropower Station officially generated electricity today. This morning, a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held at the construction site to celebrate the power station's electricity generation.

Among those who attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony were Ren Baige, Vice Governor of Sichuan Province, Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Mayor of Chongqing; Cheng Mingsheng, Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry; Soviet experts Sidnikov and Dudri; and construction site workers, totaling over two hundred people.

Today, the power station's dam, construction site square, and some tall buildings were adorned with large red banners celebrating the power generation and brightly colored flags. Yesterday, the red flag was raised for the first time on the roof of the power plant, and palace lanterns were hung under the eaves. The newly installed first hydroelectric generating unit was also draped in red, green, and colorful silks. The "Glory Pavilion" and "Glory Board" at the construction site were filled with glorious deeds and photos of labor models and advanced producers who had contributed to the construction of the hydropower station over the past two years. The workers were all incredibly excited about the early generation of electricity at the hydropower station.

The Shizitan Hydropower Station began trial operation and power generation on October 1st. Over the past twenty days, workers have conducted a comprehensive inspection and observation of the various hydraulic structures of the power station's water diversion system and have carried out a series of tests on the first hydroelectric generating unit. Now, this work has been completed. According to the national construction plan, the first hydroelectric generating unit has officially generated electricity two months ahead of schedule.

The Shizitan Hydropower Station began construction in August 1954. Now, in addition to the first hydroelectric generating unit starting to generate electricity, the installation of the remaining hydroelectric generating units and civil engineering works are also being stepped up. It is expected that all civil engineering tasks will be basically completed by the end of this year, and the installation of all mechanical and electrical equipment will be completed in the first quarter of next year.

    狮子滩水电站第一台发电机组发电
    新华社重庆30日电　狮子滩水电站第一台发电机组，今天正式发电。今天上午，工地上举行了电站发电剪彩仪式。
    参加剪彩仪式的有四川省副省长、中共重庆市委书记，重庆市市长任白戈，电力工业部部长助理程明升，苏联专家西德尼科夫、杜德里和工地职工等，共二百多人。
    电站的拦河大坝、工地广场和一些高大的建筑物上，今天挂满了庆祝发电的大红标语和鲜艳夺目的彩旗。发电厂的屋顶上昨天第一次飘起了红旗，屋檐下悬挂着宫灯；新安装的第一台水轮发电机组，也披上了红红绿绿的彩绸。工地上的光荣亭和光荣榜上贴满了两年来建设水电站的劳动模范、先进生产者的光荣事迹和照片。职工们都为水电站的提前发电感到无比兴奋。
    狮子滩水电站从10月1日开始试运转发电。二十多天来，工人们对电站引水系统的各项水工建筑物作了全面的检查和观测，并对第一台水轮发电机组进行了一系列的试验。现在这些工作都已结束。按照国家规定的建设计划，第一台水轮发电机组已经提前了两个月正式发电。
    狮子滩水电站从1954年8月开工兴建。现在除了第一台水轮发电机组开始发电外，其余几台水轮发电机组的安装和土建工程也正在加紧进行。预计到今年年底将基本上完成全部土建任务，明年第一季度完成全部机电设备的安装工程。
