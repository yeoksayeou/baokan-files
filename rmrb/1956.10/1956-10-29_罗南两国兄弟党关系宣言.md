Xinhua News Agency, October 28th -- According to a report by the Yugoslav News Agency, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Romanian Workers' Party signed a declaration on the relations between the two parties in Brioni on October 27th. The declaration stated that the overall development of relations between Romania and Yugoslavia, especially the contacts between the two parties and other political and social groups in the two countries last year, has created favorable conditions for further cooperation between the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Romanian Workers' Party.

    The development of relations and the expansion of cooperation between the two parties are necessary to further strengthen the friendly relations between the peoples and governments of the two countries, because such cooperation is conducive to the development of the international workers' movement and socialism in the world. It also helps to concretely apply the principles of active peaceful coexistence and cooperation among the peoples of the world with different social and political systems.

    The declaration stated that the relations between the two parties should be developed on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles, with full trust, sincerity and equality, non-interference in internal affairs, and free exchange of opinions (including objective, constructive, and comradely criticism).

    Both parties have stipulated practical measures to strengthen and expand the ties and cooperation between the two parties. This cooperation will be carried out through the following methods: private contacts, exchange of document information, resolutions of party congresses and plenary sessions, and the party's experience in various aspects of work, exchange of opinions on issues related to the international workers' movement and on issues related to defending and consolidating peace. In order to learn from each other's experiences in building socialism, the two sides agreed to support and organize the following work: mutual dispatch of party delegations and delegations from other social organizations, trade unions, youth and women, and mutual dispatch of worker delegations from industrial and other sectors, in order to develop other forms of comradely contact between the two parties.

    The representatives of the two parties reiterated the following view: the forms and methods of building socialism may be different in different countries and under different circumstances.

    Both sides emphasized the importance of mutual understanding and exchange of experience between the two countries in building socialism, and these experiences can be applied according to the specific conditions of each country.

    When making decisions based on the above principles, both parties believe that for the benefit of the struggle for peace and socialism worldwide, it is necessary to develop equal cooperation between communist parties and socialist parties of all countries, as well as other workers' movements and progressive movements. This cooperation helps to promote relations between the peoples of all countries and helps to strengthen the cause of world peace and progress.

    两党之间关系的发展和合作的扩大是进一步加强两国人民和政府之间的友好关系所必需的，因为这种合作有利于国际工人运动和社会主义在世界上的发展。这也有助于在具有不同的社会和政治制度的全世界人民之间具体地运用积极的和平共处和合作的原则。
    宣言说，应该从马克思列宁主义的原则出发，在充分信任、真诚和平等、不干涉内部事务、自由地交换意见（其中也包括客观的、建设性的和同志式的批评）的基础上，发展两党之间的关系。
    双方已经规定了切合实际的措施来加强和扩大两党之间的联系和合作。这种合作将通过下列办法来进行：私人间的接触，交换文件情报、党代表大会和全体会议的决议以及党在各方面的工作经验，交换有关国际工人运动的问题和有关保卫与巩固和平的问题的意见。双方为了学习两国在建设社会主义方面的经验，同意支持和组织下列工作：互派党代表团以及其他社会组织、工会、青年和妇女的代表团，互派工业和其他部门的工人代表团，以便发展两党之间其他形式的同志间的接触。
    两党的代表重申下列的看法：在不同的国家里和不同的情况下，建设社会主义的形式和方法可能是不同的。
    双方强调互相了解和交流两国在建设社会主义方面的经验的重要性，可以根据每一个国家的具体情况运用这些经验。
    双方根据上述原则作出决定的时候认为，为了在世界范围内进行和平和社会主义的斗争的利益，必须在各国共产党和社会党之间以及其他工人运动和进步运动之间发展平等的合作。这种合作有助于促进各国人民之间的关系，有助于加强世界的和平和进步事业。
