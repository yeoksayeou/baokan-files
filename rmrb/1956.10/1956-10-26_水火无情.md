    Water and Fire are Ruthless
    Shi Tan
    A child was playing by the river and accidentally fell into the water, unable to climb out. Just when he was in danger, a teacher came along. The child hurriedly shouted:
      "Teacher! Teacher! Quick, quick, save, save me!"
    The teacher poked the child with his finger, saying:
      "Hey, you child are really disobedient! Who told you to play in the water? It is often said that water and fire are ruthless, can water be played with casually?"
    The child had already swallowed several mouthfuls of water and said weakly:
      "Yes, it's my, my fault for, for not, not listening... Teacher, you, you save, save me, up, up first, and, and then, then scold me, I..."
    The teacher felt he had to fully expound his views and theories. "Even if you like to play in the water, you should learn to swim first!" the teacher said. "If you knew how to swim, you wouldn't need to ask for help now, would you? Look..."
    Before the teacher could finish speaking, a wave pulled the child into the bottom of the water and drowned him.

    水火无情
    石潭
    有个小孩在河边玩水，不当心掉到水里去了，怎么也爬不起来。正在危险的时候，先生走来了。小孩急忙大声嚷叫：
      “先生！先生！快，快救，救救我吧！”
    先生使手指头逗点着小孩，说：
      “嗨，你这孩子真不听话！谁叫你玩水来着？常说水火无情，水是能随便玩的么？”
    小孩已经喝了好几口水，有气没力地说道：
      “对，只怪，怪我不，不听话……先，先生，你先救，救我上，上去，再，再教训我，我……”
    先生可不能不把他的观点和理论全部发挥出来。“你即便是喜欢玩水吧，也该先学会游泳呀！”先生说，“要是会游泳的话，这会儿你不就用不着求人了么？你看……”
    先生的话还没说完，一个浪头就把小孩卷进了水底，淹没了。
