Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 21st: Macao Dispatch: The Macao Federation of Trade Unions held a symposium of directors of various trade unions at 9:00 PM on the 18th, and unanimously passed a resolution to write a letter of condolence to the various trade unions, workers, and compatriots from all walks of life in Kowloon who were harmed in the Kowloon riots.

The letter of condolence stated: "All trade union brothers in Macao are filled with indignation and hatred for the riotous acts of the Kuomintang special agents in Kowloon. We extend our utmost concern and heartfelt condolences to all worker brothers and sisters and compatriots from all walks of life who were harmed, and express our respect for your brave spirit in resolutely defending trade unions, factories, and schools."

The letter stated: "The root cause of this riot is the long-term tolerance of the Hong Kong British authorities towards Kuomintang special agent organizations using Hong Kong and Kowloon to endanger the Chinese people and engage in activities harmful to peace. Therefore, the Hong Kong British authorities cannot shirk their due responsibility for this incident. To this end, workers from all walks of life in Macao unanimously support the protest lodged by our Premier Zhou to Britain, and express our full support for the four correct demands put forward by the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions to the Hong Kong authorities."

    澳门工会联合总会写信慰问九龙被害工友
    据新华社广州21日电　澳门消息：澳门工会联合总会在18日下午九时召开的各业工会理事座谈会上，一致通过写信慰问在九龙暴乱中受害的九龙各业工会、各业工人和各界同胞。
    慰问信中说：对国民党特务分子在九龙的暴乱行为，全澳各行业工会兄弟无不切齿痛恨，对受害全体工人兄弟姊妹及各界同胞致以万分的关怀和亲切的慰问，并对你们坚决保卫工会、工厂、学校的勇敢精神表示敬意。
    信中说：“这次暴乱的根本原因，是香港英国当局长期以来纵容国民党特务组织利用港九危害中国人民和危害和平活动所造成的。因而香港英国当局是不能推卸其对事件应有的责任。为此，澳门各业工人一致拥护我国周总理向英国提出的抗议，对港九工会联合会向香港当局提出的四项正确要求表示全力支持。”
