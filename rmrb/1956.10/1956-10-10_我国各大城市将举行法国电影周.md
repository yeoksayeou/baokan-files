The film won the Best Director Award at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival.

　　A delegation of French film workers, at the invitation of our country, has formed a delegation that will visit our country during the Film Week.

　　我国各大城市将举行法国电影周
    新华社9日讯　10月14日起到月底，我国各大城市将先后举行法国电影周，放映“勇士的奇遇”、“没有留下地址”和“禁止的游戏”三部片子。
    电影周是由中国人民对外文化协会和中国电影工作者联谊会筹委会联合主办的，在下列城市举行：北京、天津、上海、沈阳、哈尔滨、武汉、广州、重庆、西安、乌鲁木齐。北京市将在23日举行电影周开幕式，25日正式放映电影。
    “勇士的奇遇”（原名“马兰花·方方”）取材自一首法国民歌。影片通过马兰花·方方一段奇遇，巧妙地讽刺了贵族阶级的庸俗、无能，赞扬了法国人民豪爽、乐观、坚强的性格和真挚的感情。
    “没有留下地址”借一个受骗的年轻姑娘到巴黎来找她那没有留下地址的爱人所经历的一段故事，对法国工人阶级作了朴实而优美的描写，热情而真挚的歌颂。本片曾获得在卡罗维发利举行的国际电影赛会的最优秀导演奖。
    “禁止的游戏”通过小孩子的不幸遭遇，大胆地谴责了战争的罪恶。
    法国电影工作者应我国邀请，已组成代表团，将在电影周期间来我国访问。代表团长是法国电影局局长贾克·弗洛，副团长是影片“没有留下地址”的制片人普娄。
