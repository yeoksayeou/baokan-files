Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th - The Chinese football team, shooting team, and track and field team participating in the 16th Olympic Games have arrived in Guangzhou successively on October 25th, 27th, and 28th. Together with the Chinese gymnastics team, weightlifting team, and basketball team that arrived in Guangzhou earlier, they are all staying at the scenic Guangzhou Sports Club. The Chinese swimming team will also arrive soon.

The Chinese athletes participating in the Olympic Games are in high spirits. The track and field team just arrived here in the morning and started intensive training in the afternoon. After arriving in Guangzhou, each sports team has formulated a short-term training plan before going abroad.

The arrival of the various sports teams has excited the people of Guangzhou. On the evening of the 27th, the Guangdong Provincial Sports Commission and the Guangzhou Municipal Sports Commission held a grand welcome party for them. To meet the demands of the people of Guangzhou, basketball, football and other sports teams have agreed to perform several times in Guangzhou.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th - The newly built Guangzhou Sports Club is currently welcoming Chinese athletes preparing to participate in the 16th Olympic Games.

The Guangzhou Sports Club is located on Ersha Head, a triangular island in the Pearl River, surrounded by water and shaded by green trees. The island is full of flowers and green grass, with beautiful scenery. Although it is already the end of October, and people in Beijing are already wearing sweaters, the athletes here are still wearing single layers. Practicing here allows the athletes to adapt more easily to the summer climate in Melbourne at the end of November.

The Sports Club has newly opened two grass football fields with 400-meter running tracks, a throwing field, and a newly built gymnasium. In the gymnasium, basketball, gymnastics, weightlifting, and other sports can be practiced simultaneously. The Sports Club also has a 50-meter swimming pool, a diving pool, and some outdoor basketball courts, volleyball courts, tennis courts, and equipment fields.

The paths near the river on the island have also become places for athletes to recover from fatigue after training.

    参加奥林匹克运动会的中国运动员到广州
    新华社广州29日电　参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会的中国足球队、射击队和田径队已经在10月25日、27日和28日先后来到广州。他们同早些时候到达广州的中国体操队、举重队和篮球队一起，都住在风景优美的广州体育俱乐部里。中国游泳队不久也要到来。
    参加奥林匹克运动会的中国运动员们情绪饱满。田径队上午刚刚到达这里，下午就开始了紧张的练习。各个运动队到达广州以后都制定了出国前的短期训练计划。
    各个运动队的到来，使广州市人民感到兴奋。27日晚上，广东省体育运动委员会和广州市体育运动委员会为他们举办了一个盛大的欢迎晚会。为了满足广州市人民的要求，篮球、足球等运动队已经答应在广州作几次表演。
    据新华社广州29日电　今年新修建的广州体育俱乐部目前正在迎接准备参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会的中国运动员们。
    广州体育俱乐部位在珠江的一个三角形小岛——二沙头上，它四面环水，绿树成荫。岛上到处有鲜花然和绿草，风景优美。现在虽已经到了10月底，在北京人们早已穿上毛衣，但是在这里运动员们仍然穿着单衣。运动员们在这里练习，可以使他们更容易适应11月底墨尔本的夏季气候。
    体育俱乐部新开辟两个环有四百公尺长跑道的草地足球场，一个投掷场和一个新建的体育馆。在体育馆中，可以同时进行篮球、体操、举重等项运动的练习。体育俱乐部还有一个五十公尺长的游泳池、一个跳水池和一些室外篮球场、排球场、网球场和器械场等设备。
    岛上临江的小路附近也成了运动员锻炼后恢复疲劳的场所。
