However, as far as I know, the police authorities in charge of public security, in order to protect the peaceful and prosperous life of the citizens, have never relaxed their intensified security work since the Kowloon incident." He Xian said that with the police's full vigilance, riotous events can be prevented. He Xian hopes that Macau residents will remain calm and carry on with their respective occupations.

He Xian said that Macau residents have always loved peaceful lives. He believes that with everyone's close vigilance, Macau residents will surely be able to live a tranquil life.
