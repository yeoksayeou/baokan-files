    Hunan's Shaoyang, Chenxian, Hengyang and Other Special Districts
    Will Install 363 Water Pumps
    (Xinhua News Agency) On both banks of rivers in the Shaoyang, Chenxian, Hengyang, Xiangtan and other special districts of Hunan Province, which have suffered relatively severe droughts this year, 363 water pumps with a total of more than 8,000 horsepower are planned to be installed in the winter. After this batch of water pumps is installed, it can irrigate 500,000 mu of farmland, and the number of units is equivalent to the total number of water pumps installed in the province in the past six years.
    The first batch of 60 water pumps produced by the relevant factories that manufactured the water pumps is being shipped to the countryside one after another.
    All localities have completed the survey and design work for installing water pumps. Three hundred and ninety future farmer water pump operators have been concentrated in the training class held by the Provincial Water Pump General Station since October 5 to study.
    Most areas of Hunan Province suffered severe droughts this year, but areas irrigated by water pumps generally achieved bumper harvests. For example, the early rice per mu in the paddy fields of the Qingshui River Agricultural Cooperative in Liling County increased by an average of 38% compared with the bumper harvest of 1955 because of the irrigation of water pumps, and the late rice harvest may even exceed the early rice.

    湖南邵阳、郴县、衡阳等专区
    将安装抽水机三百六十三台
    据新华社讯　湖南省今年遭受干旱比较严重的邵阳、郴县、衡阳、湘潭等专区的河流两岸，冬天准备安装共八千多马力的三百六十三台抽水机。这批抽水机安装后可以灌溉五十万亩农田，它的台数相当于过去六年中全省已安装的抽水机台数的总和。
    承制抽水机的有关工厂生产出来的第一批六十台抽水机，正在陆续运往农村。
    各地都已完成安装抽水机的勘测设计工作。三百九十名未来的农民抽水机手，从10月5日起已集中在省抽水机总站举办的训练班里学习。
    今年湖南省大部地区遭受严重的干旱，但在有抽水机引水灌溉的地区，一般都获得丰收。例如醴陵县清水江清水江农业社的稻田，今年因为有抽水机抽水灌溉，早稻每亩平均比丰收的1955年增产38％，晚稻的收成还可能超过早稻。
