　　A Few Opinions on Inheriting the Legacy of National Painting
　　Qin Zhongwen
    A young Western-style painter was about to begin studying traditional national painting. He asked me: what method should I use to accept the excellent traditional painting heritage of the nation? I suggested: why not go to the Painting Gallery of the Palace Museum to visit carefully, appreciate all the paintings, gain understanding, and then, based on this understanding, further study how to criticize, accept, and inherit it. Later, I was surprised that his opinion of the paintings in the gallery was that the paintings of the Tang and Song dynasties were good, and there was nothing good after the Yuan and Ming dynasties.

    I also met two Chinese painting teachers from a normal college fine arts department in the Southwest. They said: in order to train fine arts teachers, the established teaching plan is based entirely on Chinese painting. The Chinese painting achievements of their students, including flowers, birds, figures, etc., were all copied from Song Dynasty painting albums and drew on Dunhuang murals, paying considerable attention to ancient painting techniques and forms, but I felt they lacked a realistic and lively atmosphere. The two of them had visited the Painting Gallery, but also expressed regret that the rare ancient paintings of the Tang and Song dynasties were not on display, and they were not very interested in the paintings after the Tang and Song dynasties.

    In addition, I have heard many similar opinions (i.e., opinions of the kind that "modern paintings after the Tang and Song dynasties are not good enough to be accepted as heritage"). I think that all these tendencies to ignore the legacy of modern painting may bring serious bias and influence to today's work of studying painting heritage.

    There are always some people in the world who hold the view that the distant past is valuable and the present is cheap, that the ancient is important and the modern is not, to some extent. Naturally, they also hold this view on the issue of inheriting the national painting heritage. The root of this kind of thinking is the confusion between the value of the painting art itself and its historical value. There is also a prevailing trend of thought among many people who rely on hearsay and pretend to understand, which affects not only the general public, but also cultivates some unconscious subjective prejudices among painting researchers. I think that people with such prejudices will not achieve good results in trying to accept and inherit painting heritage.

    History is developing, neither staying still forever nor regressing. The facts of painting heritage tell us that from the Sui and Tang dynasties to the Yuan, Ming and modern times, the entire national painting style naturally had many changes, and it was by no means "getting worse from generation to generation" or "going downhill." Some people sighed about Chinese painting and said: "The distance from antiquity is increasing, and the true works are becoming rarer!" "The paintings of the Tang and Song dynasties are like wine made with yeast, which has been gradually watered down by painters of later generations, and now it has become pure water, with no taste of wine!" I think this kind of view is incorrect. Wine cannot remain unchanged. Naturally, various ingredients will be added to supplement and change it to become another excellent drink. How can we say that the things that are changed later are not as good as before?

    From the perspective of technique and style, Qiu Shizhou may have carefully studied the painting style of Zhan Ziqian of the Sui Dynasty. I want to raise this question: apart from history and other conditions, where is Zhan Ziqian's painting style higher than Qiu Shizhou's? Today, Zhan Ziqian's "Touring Spring" and Qiu Shizhou's works are both on display in the Painting Gallery. Please see if Qiu Shizhou's style is not more proficient and advanced than that of his predecessors? For example, the four Wangs, Wu, and Yun, the six great painters of the Qing Dynasty, each learned more or less from the brush and ink techniques of Huang Zihjiu of the Yuan Dynasty. Today, when we compare the brush and ink, techniques, composition, and coloring of the four Wangs and others with the true works of the Yuan Dynasty, is it lower? Or is it richer and more vivid? There are also many flower and bird painters since the Ming and Qing Dynasties, such as Xinluo Shanren, etc. Naturally, their works are not consistent with the court paintings of the Song Dynasty, but apart from subjective personal preferences, what reason do we have to say that they are watered-down wine without the taste of wine?

    In my opinion, the paintings displayed in the Painting Gallery of the Palace Museum today, whether ancient or modern, all possess different excellent styles and are extremely rich. Each of us with different views of benevolence and wisdom can gain understanding through our own experience and discover objects of acceptance that suit our tastes. I suggest that painters who intend to inherit the national painting heritage should not have any preconceptions and should gain an in-depth understanding of all the paintings they come into contact with, so as to obtain the correct critical ability, and then further study how to accept them. If we do not completely eliminate unrealistic subjective views such as valuing the distant past and devaluing the present, attaching importance to the ancient and neglecting the modern, and relying on hearsay, the work of inheriting heritage will be harmed. My understanding may not be correct, and I hope comrades will correct me.

### 对于继承民族绘画遗产的一点意见

　　对于继承民族绘画遗产的一点意见
　　秦仲文
    有一位青年西画家，要开始研究民族传统的绘画，他问我：要接受民族优良传统的绘画遗产，应用什么方法？我建议：不妨到故宫博物院绘画馆去细细参观参观，对于所有的绘画，加以体会，得到了认识，然后从认识的基础上再进一步研究怎样批判和接受继承它。后来使我感到惊讶的是：他对于馆中的绘画的意见是，唐宋人画得好，元明以后没什么好的。
    我又见过西南来的某师范学院美术科的两位国画教员，他们说：为了造就美术师资，制定的教学计划全是以国画作基础的。他们携来的学生国画成绩，花鸟人物等等都临摹了宋人画册和取法于敦煌壁画，相当注意到古代绘画技法和形式，但是我感到缺少现实的和生动活泼的气息。他们两位已参观过绘画馆，但也表示遗憾，他们认为唐宋稀有的古画未展出，唐宋以后的画他们都不大感兴趣。
    此外，我听到的类似的意见（即“唐宋以后的近代绘画，没有多少好的可作为遗产接受”这类意见）还很多。我想所有这些忽视近代绘画遗产的风气，可能为今天研究绘画遗产的工作带来严重的偏失影响。
    世上原有些人，对于一切事物多少总是怀着贵远贱近、重古轻今等等观念的。他们对于继承民族绘画遗产问题，自然也就存在这种看法。这种思想根源，是把绘画艺术品的本身的价值同历史价值混淆起来的缘故。还有许多以耳代目、强作解事的人们的思想风气流行着，因而影响到不仅一般人，而且也给绘画研究者们培养了一些不自觉的主观成见。我想具有这样成见的人，在绘画遗产方面企图接受继承，是得不到好效果的。
    历史是发展的，既不永久停留，更不会倒退。绘画遗产的事实告诉我们：由隋唐迄于元明近代，整个的民族绘画风格自然地有许许多多的演变，决非“一代不如一代”、“江河日下”。有人对国画慨叹地说：“去古日远、真迹日稀！”“唐宋的画是用曲造成的酒，经过历代画家们逐渐添水，如今变成为纯水，没有酒的气味了！”我认为这一类的看法，是不正确的。酒既不可能原封不动，自然会有各式各样的佐料补充变化它而成为另一种的精良饮品，怎见得后来变化出来的东西不如从前呢？
    从技法和风格来看，仇十洲可能精心学习过隋人展子虔一路画法的，我要提出这样的问题：除去历史和其他条件之外，展子虔画法高于仇十洲的在哪里？今天展子虔的“游春图”和仇十洲的作品，都在绘画馆中陈列着，请看仇十洲的作风岂不是比前人更纯熟而进步了么？又如清朝一代的四王、吴、恽六大画家，每一个人都多少地学习过元人黄子久的笔墨技法，今天我们把四王诸家的笔墨、技法、构图、设色等等，同元人真迹比较一下，是降低？还是更丰富更生动？还有明清以来许多的花鸟画家如新罗山人等的作品，自然它们同宋本院画绝不一致，但是除去主观的个人好恶之外，我们有什么理由说它们是添了水的没有酒味的酒呢？
    我看今天故宫博物院绘画馆所陈列的，无论古今的绘画，都具备着各各不同的优良风格，可谓极端丰富。我们具有仁智不同之见的各个人，都可以通过自己的体会认识，从那里发现适合于自己脾胃的接受的对象。我建议意图继承民族绘画遗产的画家们，最好是不怀任何主见，对于凡所接触的绘画，都作深入的认识，借以获得正确的批判能力，然后进一步研究如何接受的方法。如果不把贵远贱近、重古轻今、以耳代目种种不切实际的主观看法扫除净尽，那对继承遗产的工作是会受到损失的。我的理解可能不够正确，希望同志们指正。
