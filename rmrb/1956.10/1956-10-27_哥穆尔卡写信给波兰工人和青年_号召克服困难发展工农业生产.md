Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 25th: Warsaw newspapers published a letter from Comrade Gomulka to Polish workers and youth.

    The letter first expresses gratitude to the workers and youth for the unity and support they demonstrated in welcoming the results of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party.

    The letter states that the Party believes that the Party's primary task at present is to overcome the difficulties in our economic construction and create conditions so that the working class can better utilize the productive capacity of socialist industry to increase production. Because only by developing our industrial and agricultural production, only by increasing the quantity of consumer goods to meet the needs of the people, can we improve the lives of the broadest masses.

    The letter says that only by following the path of democratization and eliminating all the malpractices of the past can we establish the best form of socialism that meets the needs of our people. We will never deviate from this path of democratization, and we will not allow anyone to use the high degree of democracy in our country to achieve anti-socialist goals.

    At the Eighth Plenary Session, we told the whole Party and the people of the whole country that we are building socialism in Poland, and we should strengthen fraternal and friendly relations with all socialist countries, especially with our great neighbor, the Soviet Union. We should build this relationship on the principles of international workers' solidarity, mutual trust, equality of rights, and mutual assistance.

    The letter concludes by saying that we are entering a new period in Poland's development. Only the correct and resolute policy of the Party, which has the support of the working class and the broadest masses of the people, only the hard work of the whole country to achieve our economic results, only the unity of all progressive and socialist forces in the national front, can lead us to our goal.

    哥穆尔卡写信给波兰工人和青年
    号召克服困难发展工农业生产
    新华社华沙25日电　华沙各报刊载了哥穆尔卡同志给波兰工人和青年的信。
    信中首先感谢工人和青年在迎接波兰统一工人党中央委员会第八次全体会议结果时表现的团结和拥护。
    信中说，党认为，党当前的主要任务是，克服我们经济建设中的困难，创造条件使工人阶级能够更好地利用社会主义工业的生产能力来提高生产。因为，只有发展我们的工农业生产，只有增加满足人民需要的消费品数量，才能改善最广大群众的生活。
    信中说，只有遵循民主化的道路，并且消除过去时期的一切弊害，我们才能够建立符合于我国人民需要的社会主义的最好形式。我们决不脱离这条民主化的道路，我们也决不允许任何人利用我国生活的高度民主化来达到反社会主义的目的。
    在第八次全体会议上，我们告诉全党和全国人民，我们正在波兰建设社会主义，我们应该同一切社会主义国家、特别是同我们伟大的邻国苏联加强兄弟友好关系。我们应该把这种关系建筑在国际工人团结一致、互相信任和权利平等以及互相提供帮助的原则上。
    信中最后说，我们正在进入波兰的发展中的一个新的时期。唯有党的获得工人阶级和最广泛的人民群众的支持的正确而果敢的政策，唯有全国为了达到我们经济上的结果而进行的辛勤努力，唯有全国阵线中一切进步的和社会主义的力量的团结一致，才能引导我们达到目的。
