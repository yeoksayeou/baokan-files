    Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's Large Steelmaking Workshop
    Two Newly Built Pig Iron Furnaces Put into Production
    Xinhua News Agency News: The two newly built pig iron furnaces in the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's large steelmaking workshop have been put into production. Using the molten iron produced by these two pig iron furnaces for steelmaking can increase steel ingot production by approximately 30,000 tons annually.
    Because the production capacity of ironmaking and steelmaking at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company was unbalanced, most of the steel raw materials used in the large steelmaking workshop were transported from other places. In the past, this workshop could only directly put steel raw materials into open-hearth furnaces because it lacked pig iron furnace equipment, which prolonged the steel smelting time. After the two newly built pig iron furnaces were put into production, the steelmaking time has been shortened by about 30 minutes compared to the past due to the supply of hot molten iron to the open-hearth furnaces. On October 10, the large steelmaking workshop set a new record of producing an average of five heats of steel per open-hearth furnace per day. Once the full equipment capacity of the pig iron furnaces is realized, the time for smelting each heat of steel can be further reduced.

    重庆钢铁公司大型炼钢车间
    新建的两座化铁炉投入生产
    新华社讯　重庆钢铁公司大型炼钢车间新建的两座化铁炉，已经投入生产。利用这两座化铁炉生产的铁水来炼钢，每年可以增产钢锭三万吨左右。
    重庆钢铁公司因为炼铁与炼钢的生产能力不平衡，大型炼钢车间所用的钢铁原料大部分都是从外地运来的。过去这个车间因为没有化铁炉设备，只能把钢铁原料直接投入平炉，因此延长了钢的冶炼时间，新建的两座化铁炉投入生产以后，由于供应了平炉热铁水，炼钢时间已比过去缩短了三十分钟左右。10月10日，大型炼钢车间创造了平均每座平炉每天生产五炉钢的最新纪录。等到化铁炉的全部设备能力发挥出来以后，每炼一炉钢的时间还可以缩短。
