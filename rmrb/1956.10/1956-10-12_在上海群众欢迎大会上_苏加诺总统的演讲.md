Brothers and sisters, friends, comrades! (Enthusiastic applause)

Yes, you are my brothers and sisters, you are my friends, you are my comrades, my brothers and sisters in struggle, my friends in struggle, my comrades in struggle, my brothers and sisters, friends and comrades in the struggle for independence, for peace, and for the establishment of a new world. (Applause, the crowd shouted: "Brother Gano!")

Brothers and sisters, I have said it countless times, I am immensely grateful to the Chinese people for their welcome to me and my entourage. Now I am meeting with the brothers and sisters of Shanghai. I express my gratitude to you twelve million times over. You gathered like a tide in this square to welcome our arrival. I say again, I am immensely grateful to you. (Enthusiastic applause)

However, as I have said many times, Marshal, the leader of Shanghai, has indeed praised me excessively, lauded me excessively. He repeatedly said that I am an outstanding leader, that I am a hero, he simply praised me beyond measure.

Brothers and sisters, I say, I am not someone extraordinary, I am not an outstanding leader. I am just an ordinary person like you. Because of this, I have repeatedly requested all the people of the People's Republic of China not to call me a great leader, not to call me a hero, not to call me His Excellency President Sukarno, just simply call me "Brother Gano" or "Brother Sukarno"! (The whole audience shouted "Brother Gano!")

I repeat once again, I am not the giver of independence to the Indonesian people, I am not the maker of independence for the Indonesian people, the independence of the Indonesian people is the fruit of the Indonesian people's own struggle. Even if there were ten Sukarnos, a hundred Sukarnos, or even a thousand Sukarnos, but if the eighty-two million Indonesian people did not struggle, independence would not come. Conversely, as long as the Indonesian people carry out a desperate struggle, even without Sukarno, independence will surely come. (The crowd applauded and cheered "Merdeka!")

Brothers and sisters, I understand why you are flocking to this square like a tide, why you have been standing in this square for hours since eight or nine in the morning, why the citizens of Shanghai were so enthusiastic in welcoming our arrival yesterday, why the citizens of Beijing were so enthusiastic in welcoming our arrival, why the citizens of Shenyang were so enthusiastic in welcoming our arrival.

As I said at the banquet held by the Mayor of Shanghai yesterday, I understand that in fact, you are not welcoming a person named Sukarno or Brother Gano, you are welcoming Indonesia's independence, you are welcoming the struggle of the Indonesian people, the struggle against colonialism and against imperialism, which is also the struggle you are engaged in. (Applause)

Yes, friends, the Indonesian people are a people in struggle; you are also a people in struggle. You feel that the Indonesian people are your friends, your comrades, you feel that you share a common aspiration and determination with the Indonesian people, because the Indonesian people's struggle is also your struggle. You are warriors, the Indonesian nation is also a warrior, you and the Indonesian nation are comrades advancing side by side, comrades-in-arms.

Brothers and sisters, this is my second long journey. I call it the second stage of the visit. In the first stage, I visited the Americas and Western Europe. This time, the second stage, I visited the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Mongolia, and now I am with the people of the People's Republic of China.

Brothers and sisters, do you know? My experiences in these two stages of visits are of great value. I will tell you about it in a while. (Applause)

Brothers and sisters, let me give you an example first. In this second stage of the visit, I received warm welcomes from various countries. The people of the Soviet Union warmly welcomed me, the people of Yugoslavia warmly welcomed me, the people of Czechoslovakia warmly welcomed me, and the people of the People's Republic of China welcomed me with unparalleled enthusiasm. (Enthusiastic applause) You welcome us with hearts of friendship and sympathy, what does this show? In fact, we are not the same nation. In the Soviet Union are the Soviet people, in Yugoslavia are the Yugoslav people, in Czechoslovakia are the Czechoslovak people, in the People's Republic of China are the people of the People's Republic of China, and I belong to the Indonesian nation. However, even though we belong to different nations, we have common aspirations and brotherly feelings. Even though our ideologies may be different, there is mutual sympathy and brotherly friendship between us. (Applause)

As everyone knows, a significant conference was held in Bandung last year, the Asian-African Conference attended by representatives of twenty-nine countries with a population of 1.6 billion. The Bandung Conference - the Asian-African Conference, clearly declared that various nations can coexist in a brotherly and friendly atmosphere, and clearly declared that various nations should coexist, should coexist peacefully. In my second stage of visits, the warm welcome I received from the people of various places shows that: the Bandung主張 is correct, various nations can coexist peacefully, can get along and cooperate like brothers, friends and comrades. (Applause)

Friends, this morning I paid my respects to the former residence of my esteemed leader Dr. Sun Yat-sen. It was there that I thought of his doctrine. What doctrine? He said that there should be nations, but, friends, each nation should be friendly to each other like brothers and live together in an atmosphere of internationalism. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that if someone hopes to realize cosmopolitanism, that would be wrong. Cosmopolitanism believes that there is no need for nations, there should be no distinction between people around the world. This doctrine is cosmopolitanism. Dr. Sun Yat-sen believed that this kind of cosmopolitanism is wrong. Contrary to cosmopolitans, Dr. Sun Yat-sen said: There should be nations, there should be the Chinese nation, the Japanese nation, the Indian nation, the Indonesian nation, the Egyptian nation, the English nation, the American nation. There should be nations, but each nation should be friendly to each other like brothers. It is not wrong for national distinctions to exist internationally. It is wrong for various nations to hate each other, conflict with each other, and kill each other. All nations in the world should live together with the spirit of internationalism, like friends and comrades, this is the right thing to do. (Applause)

Yes, brothers and sisters, when I paid my respects to the former residence of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, I thought of him with reverence. When I left there, I felt full of confidence. The reason I feel full of confidence is because I am the son of the Indonesian nation, and I am proud of it. Similarly, I also ask you, I hope you will be proud of being the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. Brothers and sisters, let us all be proud of having our own nation - the Indonesian nation, the People's Republic of China or the Chinese nation! However, it is wrong for some nations to oppress other nations, for some nations to exercise colonial rule over other nations, for some nations to suck the blood of other nations. This kind of behavior should be opposed, should be opposed, should be opposed with all our strength. (Applause, the crowd shouted: "Merdeka!")

Friends, it is sinful to exercise colonial rule over other nations, it is sinful to enslave other nations. But there is also a sinful thing, a thing that is extremely sinful, and that is: to impose the ideology of one's own nation on another nation, to impose one's own ideas on others. This kind of coercion is sinful, is extremely sinful. (Applause, the whole audience shouted: "Long live peace!")

Yes, friends, it is sinful to impose an ideology on another nation. Have you ever imposed your ideology on other nations? No! Has the Indonesian nation ever imposed its ideology on others? No! None of us have forced other nations to accept our ideology. We all love our own ideas, but we also respect other people's ideas, we are willing to live together with all nations in the world like brothers. We are willing to work together with all nations in the world to build a new world where everyone can live a happy and prosperous life. (Applause)

Friends, I really don't understand why there are still some countries or governments that are unwilling to recognize the People's Republic of China. I have seen with my own eyes: all the people of the People's Republic of China support the Mao Zedong government, six hundred million people support Mao Zedong, love Mao Zedong. Friends, I really don't understand why there are still some countries or governments that would say that Mao Zedong has no supporters, Mao Zedong does not receive the love of the people, therefore, there is no need to recognize the Mao Zedong government. Friends, I don't understand this matter.

But, I say to you, move forward, move forward, brothers and sisters! I say, in the near future, the whole world will surely recognize the government of the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of China! (Long applause)

Brothers and sisters, some people say: "Why recognize the government of the People's Republic of China? It is true that the People's Republic of China has a large population, six hundred million people, a considerable number, but it has no material strength, it does not have the strong material strength that my country has, why should we recognize the People's Republic of China?"

Brothers and sisters, those who say this do not understand the value of spirit, they do not understand the value of the people's love. They also do not understand that without the sincere support of the people, no country can be established. They are forgetting this point.

Brothers and sisters, it is the same with us in Indonesia, we declared independence on August 17, 1945, and in the beginning, we had no material strength at all. We fought with spirit, and you also fought with spirit. Brothers and sisters, spirit is our most powerful weapon! (Applause)

Yes, brothers and sisters, the spirit of vigorous and奋发 is our most powerful weapon. Thousands of years ago, Confucius said: "The three armies can be deprived of their commander, but a common man cannot be deprived of his will." (Long applause. The crowd cheered "Long live Brother Gano!")

Brothers and sisters, I repeat once again, the Indonesian nation fights with spirit, and the Chinese nation also fights with spirit. Spirit is our only and most powerful weapon. The enemy does not know this.

Brothers and sisters, at the banquet last night, our dear brother Marshal Chen Yi said that when Shanghai began to return to your hands, the enemy said: "They will not be able to live in Shanghai for three months." But the actual situation is that the government has stood here for seven years. As Marshal said last night, it will stand here forever! (Long applause)

Brothers and sisters, the situation of the Indonesian people engaged in combat is also like this. When we declared Indonesian independence on August 17, 1945, we had nothing in our hands, we only had four things: first, the red and white flag, which has a history of thousands of years; second, the "Great Indonesia" song; third, a draft constitution; fourth, a declaration of independence. Other than these, we had nothing. Brothers and sisters, we had nothing concrete that could be seen, we had nothing material. However, we had something indestructible, that is spirit, spirit, spirit. I say it again, spirit! (Applause) Brothers and sisters, at that time we only had spirit. The enemy did not understand the value of spirit, the enemy mocked us and said: "Humph, the Republic of Indonesia was declared on August 17, 1945. Humph, this Republic of Indonesia will not last for ten days." But what is the fact, brothers and sisters, the Republic of Indonesia has been established until now, not just ten days, not just ten weeks, and not just ten months, but it has been eleven years. Thank God, Indonesia must always stand forever in the world. (The whole audience applauded warmly, shouting "Merdeka")

After we stood for ten weeks, the enemy realized that their estimate was wrong. They initially said that we would not last for ten days, but after ten weeks, we were still standing and had not fallen. Then, they launched an attack, they used force to attack us, guns, cannons, bombs and grenades poured down on us like a torrential rain. They burned Indonesian villages and massacred Indonesian people. However, brothers and sisters, we Indonesian people resisted, resisted, and resisted again by relying on spirit. We resisted for five years, the blood of Indonesian youth stained the Indonesian land red, the blood of Indonesian farmers stained the Indonesian land red, the blood of Indonesian workers stained the Indonesian land red. Brothers and sisters! We persisted in fighting for five years, and finally, the imperialists had to recognize the independence of the Indonesian nation on December 27, 1949, and recognize the Republic of Indonesia. (Long applause. The crowd shouted "Independence!")

Brothers and sisters, in 1949, as a result of the struggle of the people of the People's Republic of China, our dear brother Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China. At the end of 1949, the Netherlands recognized the Republic of Indonesia. Not only that, but the whole world recognized her. Following the world's recognition of the Republic of Indonesia, in the beginning of 1950, the Republic of Indonesia immediately recognized the People's Republic of China. (Enthusiastic applause)

Brothers and sisters, after the Republic of Indonesia recognized the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of China recognized the Republic of Indonesia, the Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China became friends with each other, advanced together, and fought together. Brothers and sisters, look, how beautiful it is, how beautiful it is, that the national flags of the People's Republic of China and Indonesia are flying together! Brothers and sisters, I am convinced that the national flags of these two countries will always fly together, beautifying our sky. (The crowd applauded and shouted: Long live the friendship between the People's Republic of China and Indonesia! Long live world peace!)

Yes, brothers and sisters, we are comrades to each other, friends, because we are comrades-in-arms, the People's Republic of China and Indonesia advance side by side together to oppose imperialism, oppose colonialism, establish a new world and strive for world peace. The People's Republic of China and Indonesia also hope that all countries in the world, especially the people of Asian and African countries, will make friends and become comrades like the Asian-African Conference showed, and work together hand in hand.

Brothers and sisters, when the Bandung Conference was able to proceed smoothly last year, no one was more grateful to God than Brother Gano, because my belief and ideal is that only by relying on international cooperation can international imperialism be defeated; if the nations of Asia and Africa have not united, it is impossible to completely eliminate imperialism and colonialism. (Applause)

Brothers and sisters, I said just now that both I and Dr. Sun Yat-sen believe that the existence of nations is necessary and beneficial. Each nation not only has its own characteristics and features, but everyone recognizes that they also each have their own symbols. For example, the symbol of the Chinese nation is the dragon, the symbol of the Filipino nation is the carabao, the symbol of the Vietnamese nation is the multi-headed snake, the symbol of the Siamese nation is the white elephant, the symbol of the Burmese nation is the peacock, the symbol of the Indian nation is the sacred cow, the symbol of the Egyptian nation is the sphinx, and the symbol of the Indonesian nation is the wild bull. Therefore, in 1929, I, who greatly longed for the unity of Asia and Africa, said at that time that if the Chinese dragon cooperates with the Filipino carabao, the Vietnamese multi-headed snake, the Burmese peacock, the Siamese white elephant, the Indian sacred cow, the Egyptian sphinx, and the Indonesian wild bull, then imperialism and colonialism will all be eliminated. (Applause)

Brothers and sisters, now, the cooperation between the people of Asia and Africa has begun, and even the cooperation between the people of Asia and Africa and the progressive people has begun. Let us continue to move forward! We will never fail, we will surely win.

Brothers and sisters, do you know how many people there are in the world? There are a total of 2.6 billion people in the world. Of these 2.6 billion people, more than two-thirds are on our side. There are already 1.6 billion people participating in the Asian-African Conference alone, and if you add other progressive people, there should be at least 2 billion people. Brothers and sisters, out of 2.6 billion people, 2 billion people are striving for world peace, striving for peaceful coexistence, striving to eliminate imperialism, striving to eliminate colonialism, and striving for cooperation. No force in the world can stop this torrent of 2 billion people, brothers and sisters, whoever dares to do so will be swallowed by the huge waves of this torrent. (Warm applause, the whole audience shouted: Long live peace!)

Brothers and sisters, I say it again, come on, let us continue to move forward! We will never fail, victory will surely belong to us. Why are we sure to win? Because, the people are our strength. The people are the source of the strength of the Republic of Indonesia, the people are the source of the strength of the People's Republic of China.

Brothers and sisters, the people, they are the guarantee of victory. Come on, let us continue to move forward, we are not isolated! The Indonesian nation is not isolated, and the Chinese nation is not isolated. The huge tide is now surging, it is the tide of the people, the tide of the people of all countries, the tide of the people with the characteristics and features of various nationalities. Friends, the fighting people, the people who build true democracy will not fail! (Applause)

Brothers and sisters, I repeat once again, the Indonesian people are the power of the Republic of Indonesia, and the Chinese people are the power of the People's Republic of China. The Indonesian people establish Indonesia's democracy according to their own path, and the Chinese people establish China's democracy according to their own path. The Indonesian people are a fighting people, and the people of the People's Republic of China are also a fighting people, therefore, Indonesia's democracy is a fighting democracy, and the People's Republic of China's democracy is also a fighting democracy.

Brothers and sisters, you and we are the two major pillars of fighting democracy. Our democracies each have their own forms according to the wishes of the people themselves. Brothers and sisters, I said just now that it is wrong for nations not to be friendly with each other and to conflict with each other. However, each nation has its own characteristics, and similarly, the democracies of each nation also have their own characteristics. It is right for you to call your democracy "people's democracy" according to the characteristics of your people, and it is also right for us to call our democracy "Pancasila" democracy according to the characteristics of the Indonesian people. However, your democracy and Indonesia's democracy are both fighting democracies, both democracies that fight against colonialism and imperialism, fight for happiness, fight for world peace, and realize a better new world! (Enthusiastic applause)

Brothers and sisters, let us continue to move forward, side by side! Our revolution has not been completed, your revolution has not been completed, and the revolution of all of us has not been completed. You have the Taiwan issue, and we have the West Irian issue. Brothers and sisters, we are fighting to incorporate West Irian into the territory of the Republic of Indonesia, and you are also fighting to incorporate Taiwan into the territory of the People's Republic of China. Everyone should move forward together. We love peace, and you also love peace. We are prepared to negotiate with the Netherlands based on the principle of recovering sovereignty over West Irian. I know that you also use peaceful means to resolve the Taiwan issue. That's right, brothers and sisters, the Indonesian people and the Chinese people both love peace.

However, people in the world should know that we love peace, but we love independence even more. (Applause)

Friends, there is a lie spreading abroad, a huge lie. Some people say that the Soviet people do not love peace, the Soviet people are an aggressive people, a warlike people, and a people who like to invade other countries. They also say that the people of the People's Republic of China are not a peace-loving people, they are a warlike people, an aggressive people, and a people who like to invade other countries. Friends, I have visited the Soviet Union, and now I am with the Chinese people. I have seen with my own eyes that all the Soviet people love peace; I have seen with my own eyes that all the Chinese people love peace. (Enthusiastic applause, the whole audience shouted: "Long live peace!")

Friends, the Indonesian people also love peace. We all love peace, the Chinese people love peace, and the Indonesian people also love peace. We love peace not because we are weak. We love peace not because we are weak. We love peace because peace is sacred to us, and peace should be the ideal of all mankind. (Applause. The whole audience cheered: "Long live peace!") Yes, friends, I repeat once again, we all love peace not because we feel weak, no, we do not feel weak. Because we have in our hands the most powerful weapon - spirit, fighting will. This is our most powerful weapon. We do not feel weak. We love peace because it is important, it is sacred. We all love peace, and we work with all our strength to realize world peace.

Friends, whenever I think about the issue of peace, whenever I think about the issue of world peace, I often feel like I am dreaming, fantasizing, but I think it is possible to achieve.

Brothers and sisters, there is the United States on the other side of the Pacific, and there are China, Indonesia, the Philippines and other countries on this side. How wonderful it would be if the nations and countries along the Pacific coast, which are currently in a state of tension, could conclude a non-aggression pact! Such a pact would eliminate wars between countries. Brothers and sisters, such an ideal often fills me, because just as I said just now, peace is an important thing, an ideal, a principle, and it must become the criterion in our common struggle. (Applause. The crowd cheered: "Long live peace!")

If there is a non-aggression treaty with all the Pacific Rim countries participating - including Canada, the United States, Mexico, Latin American countries, Japan, the People's Republic of China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Burma, India, and even all Arab countries and Egypt - then all problems can be resolved through peaceful means. Not only that, but mankind will coexist peacefully in an atmosphere of peace and cooperation. (Long applause)

Brothers and sisters, I repeat once again, for us - the people of the People's Republic of China, the people of Indonesia, and other progressive people, peace is important, it is sacred, and we will always work for world peace. I say it again, we love peace, not because we are weak. No. I say, we love peace, but we love independence even more. We are peace-loving, brothers and sisters, but once our independence is violated, we will fight to the death to defend our independence. (The whole audience applauded warmly, shouting "Long live peace!")

The Indonesian nation loves independence, and the Chinese nation also loves independence, we all love independence.

Brothers and sisters, in the past, I said in the United States that we will never give up any point of independence to anyone, and we will never sell any point of independence to anyone. We will always maintain our independence! (Applause) We must continue to move forward, we must continue to fight! Young men and women, I especially ask you, continue to move forward! Love your motherland, love your nation, love your independence, love the ideals of your countless ancestors who suffered and sacrificed in order to achieve them! Continue to move forward, the world of the future does not belong to the elderly, the world of the future belongs to you! The sun of the future is yours, the moon of the future is yours, and the stars of the future are also yours. Continue to move forward, young men and women! Brothers and sisters, the strength of the elderly is no match for the youth. In Indonesia, I often compare the strength of the elderly with the strength of young men and women, I say, if you give me a million elderly people, I can move mountains; if you give me a hundred young people, as long as these hundred young people are filled with a fiercely burning fighting will and fighting spirit, then I can completely change the whole world. (Applause)

Brothers and sisters, I bring you the greetings of eighty-two million Indonesian people; I bring you the love of the Indonesian people for you. I cannot be with you for a long time, and I will leave the territory of the People's Republic of China in a few days. Brothers and sisters, I would like to tell you that during my stay in the People's Republic of China, I am even more convinced that the brotherly friendship between the Chinese people and the Indonesian people is eternal and inseparable, and that no force in the world can destroy this brotherly friendship. Just as I said in Anshan, if we can maintain this brotherly friendship, not only maintain it, but also temper it constantly, then this brotherly friendship will be harder and stronger than your Anshan steel.

There is an Indonesian proverb: "Far away in the sky, close to the heart". In the future, when I leave the People's Republic of China and return to Indonesia, then, in my eyes, you will be thousands of kilometers away. But, please remember, the people of the People's Republic of China will always be close to Brother Gano's heart, and will always be close to the hearts of all Indonesian people from Sabang to Merauke! (Long applause. The crowd cheered "Brother Gano!")

Brothers and sisters, I am an engineer, and my former job was to build steel bridges. But, what I am building now is not a steel bridge, but a bridge of brotherly friendship from Indonesia to China. I have invited Chairman Mao Zedong to visit Indonesia, and Chairman Mao Zedong has accepted my invitation. I hope that in the near future, Chairman Mao Zedong will come to Indonesia, and he will also build a bridge, a bridge of brotherly friendship from the People's Republic of China to Indonesia. (Long applause. The crowd cheered: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live President Sukarno!" "Long live peace!")

Brothers and sisters:

Long live the People's Republic of China! (Applause)
Long live the Republic of Indonesia! (Applause)
Long live the friendship between the People's Republic of China and Indonesia! (Applause)
Long live world peace! (Applause)
Long live the struggle to realize a new world! (Long applause, cheers. President Sukarno responded in Chinese: "Thank you".)

### 在上海群众欢迎大会上  苏加诺总统的演讲

1956-10-12
第5版()
专栏：

    在上海群众欢迎大会上
    苏加诺总统的演讲兄弟姐妹们，朋友们，同志们：（热烈的鼓掌）
    是的，你们是我的兄弟姐妹，你们是我的朋友，你们是我的同志，是我在斗争中的兄弟姐妹，是我在斗争中的朋友，是我在斗争中的同志，是我在争取独立、争取和平和争取建立新世界的斗争中的兄弟姐妹、朋友和同志。（鼓掌，群众高呼：“加诺兄”！）
    兄弟姐妹们，我已经说了无数次，我万分感谢中国人民对我和我的随行人员的欢迎。我现在和上海的兄弟姐妹见面了。我向你们表示十二万分的感谢。你们像潮水般地汇集到这个广场上来欢迎我们的到来。我再说一次，我万分感谢你们。（热烈的鼓掌）
    但是，我已经说过很多次了，上海市的领导人元帅先生确实是过分推崇我了，过分赞扬我了。他反复再三说我是一个杰出的领袖，说我是一个英雄，他简直把我夸奖得无以复加。
    兄弟姐妹们，我说，我并不是什么非凡的人物，我并不是什么卓越的领袖。我跟大家一样，只不过是一个普通的人。因为这样，我多次请求中华人民共和国全体人民，不要称呼我伟大的领袖、不要称呼我英雄、不要称呼我苏加诺总统阁下，就简单地称呼我“加诺兄”或“苏加诺兄”吧！（全场高呼“加诺兄！”）
    我再重复一遍，我不是印度尼西亚人民独立的赐予者，我不是印度尼西亚人民独立的制造者，印度尼西亚人民的独立是印度尼西亚人民自己斗争得来的果实。即使有十个苏加诺，一百个苏加诺，甚至一千个苏加诺，但是，如果八千二百万的印度尼西亚人民不去进行斗争，独立是不会到来的。相反的，只要印度尼西亚人民进行殊死的斗争，即使没有苏加诺，独立也一定要到来。（群众鼓掌并欢呼“默地加！”）
    兄弟姐妹们，我了解，你们为什么要像潮水般地涌到这个广场上来，你们为什么要从早上八、九点钟就到这个广场上来一连站立了几个钟头，为什么全上海的市民昨天要那么热烈地欢迎我们的到来，为什么北京的市民要那么热烈地欢迎我们的到来，为什么沈阳的市民要那么热烈地欢迎我们的到来。
    像我昨天在上海市长举行的宴会上所说的那样，我了解，事实上你们欢迎的不是一个名叫苏加诺或加诺兄的人，你们欢迎的是印度尼西亚的独立，你们欢迎的是印度尼西亚人民的斗争，是反对殖民主义和反对帝国主义的斗争，也就是你们所进行的斗争。（鼓掌）
    是的，朋友们，印度尼西亚人民是斗争中的人民；你们也是斗争中的人民。你们感到印度尼西亚人民是你们的朋友，是你们的同志，你们感到和印度尼西亚人民有共同的心愿和决心，这是因为印度尼西亚人民的斗争目标也就是你们的斗争目标。你们是战士，印度尼西亚民族也是战士，你们和印度尼西亚民族是并肩前进的同志，是战友。
    兄弟姐妹们，我是第二次作长途旅行了。我把它叫做第二阶段的访问。开头的第一阶段，我访问了美洲和西欧。这次，第二阶段，我访问了苏联，访问了南斯拉夫，访问了奥地利，访问了捷克斯洛伐克，访问了蒙古，现在，我又跟中华人民共和国人民在一起。
    兄弟姐妹们，你们知道吗？我这两个阶段访问的经历是有很大价值的。再过一会儿，我还要讲给大家听听。（鼓掌）
    兄弟姐妹们，先举个例子吧。在这第二阶段的访问中，我受到各国热烈的欢迎。苏联人民热烈地欢迎我，南斯拉夫人民热烈地欢迎我，捷克斯洛伐克人民热烈地欢迎我，中华人民共和国的人民无比热烈地欢迎我。（热烈鼓掌）你们怀着友好和同情的心来欢迎我们，这说明了什么呢？其实，我们并不是同一个民族。在苏联的是苏联的民族，在南斯拉夫是南斯拉夫的民族，在捷克斯洛伐克是捷克斯洛伐克的民族，在中华人民共和国是中华人民共和国的民族，而我是属于印度尼西亚民族。然而，即使我们是属于不同的民族，我们却有着共同的心愿，有着兄弟的感情。即使我们的思想意识可能有所不同，但是，我们之间却存在着相互的同情和兄弟般的友谊。（鼓掌）
    大家都知道，去年在万隆举行了一个有着重大意义的会议，这就是拥有十六亿人口的二十九个国家的代表参加的亚非会议。万隆会议——亚非会议，明确宣布了各个民族是可以在兄弟般的友好气氛中共处的，并且明确宣布了各个民族应该共处，应该和平共处。在我第二个阶段的访问中，各地人民对我的欢迎说明了：万隆主张是正确的，各个民族能够和平共处，能够兄弟般、朋友般和同志般地相处和合作。（鼓掌）
    朋友们，我今天早晨晋谒了我敬爱的领袖孙逸仙博士的故居。就在那里我想起了他的学说。他的什么学说呢？他说，应该有民族，但是，朋友们，各个民族应该像兄弟一样相互友好，共同生活在国际主义的气氛中。孙逸仙博士说，如果有人希望实现世界主义，那就错了。世界主义认为不需要民族，全世界人与人之间不应该有民族的分别。这种学说就是世界主义。这种世界主义，孙逸仙博士认为是错误的。与世界主义者相反，孙逸仙博士说：应该有民族，有中华民族、日本民族、印度民族、印度尼西亚民族、埃及民族、英吉利民族、美利坚民族。应该有民族，但是各个民族应该像兄弟一样相互友好。在国际上，存在着民族的分别这并不是错误的。各个民族互相仇视、互相冲突、互相残杀，这是错误的。世界上一切民族应该怀着国际主义精神，像朋友和同志般地共处，这样才是正确的。（鼓掌）
    是的，兄弟姐妹们，当我晋谒孙逸仙博士的故居的时候，我怀着崇敬的心情想起了他。当我离开那里的时候，我感到信心百倍。我感到信心百倍的原因是因为我是印度尼西亚民族的儿子，我以此感到自豪。同样的，我也要求你们，希望你们因为是中华民族的儿女而感到自豪。兄弟姐妹们，让我们因为有自己的民族——印度尼西亚民族、中华人民共和国或中华民族而共同感到骄傲吧！但是，有些民族却去压迫别的民族，有些民族却对别的民族实行殖民统治，有些民族却去吮吸别个民族的血，这是错误的。这种行为应该反对，应该反对，应该用尽一切力量来反对。（鼓掌，群众高呼：“默地加！”）
    朋友们，对别的民族实行殖民统治是罪恶的，奴役别的民族是罪恶的。但是还有一种罪恶的事情，一种万分罪恶的事情，那就是：把本民族的思想意识强加在别一个民族的头上，把自己的主张强加在别人的头上。这种强迫行为是罪恶的，是万分罪恶的。（鼓掌，全场高呼：“和平万岁！”）
    是的，朋友们，把一种思想意识强加在别一个民族的头上是罪恶的。那你们是不是曾经把你们的思想意识强加在别的民族的头上呢？没有！印度尼西亚民族是不是曾经把自己的思想意识强加在别人的头上呢？没有！我们大家都没有强迫别的民族接受我们的思想意识。我们大家热爱自己的思想，但是我们也尊重别人的思想，我们愿意同世界各民族像兄弟般友好地生活在一起。我们愿意同全世界各民族共同建设每个人都能过幸福繁荣生活的新世界。（鼓掌）
    朋友们，我真不了解，为什么还有一些国家或者政府还不愿意承认中华人民共和国。我这次亲眼看到了：中华人民共和国的全体人民都拥护毛泽东政府，六亿人民拥护毛泽东政府，热爱毛泽东。朋友们，我真不了解，为什么还有一些国家或者政府会说，毛泽东没有拥护者，毛泽东得不到人民的爱戴，所以，无须承认毛泽东政府。朋友们，我不理解这桩事情。
    但是，我对各位说，前进，前进吧，兄弟姐妹们！我说，不久的将来，全世界一定会承认中华人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国！（长时间鼓掌）
    兄弟姐妹们，有的人说：“为什么要承认中华人民共和国政府呢？不错，中华人民共和国人口很多，六亿之众，数目不小，可是它没有物质力量，它不像我的国家那样拥有雄厚的物质力量，为什么我们要承认中华人民共和国呢？”
    兄弟姐妹们，说这种话的人是不懂得精神的可贵，他们是不懂得人民爱戴的可贵。他们也不懂得，要是没有人民的衷心拥护，任何国家也建立不起来的。他们正是把这一点忘掉了。
    兄弟姐妹们，我们印度尼西亚也是这样，我们在1945年8月17日宣布独立，初期，我们也是完全没有物质力量的。我们凭精神战斗，你们也是凭精神战斗。兄弟姐妹们，精神就是我们最有力的武器！（鼓掌）
    是的，兄弟姐妹们，激昂奋发的精神是我们最厉害的武器。几千年前，孔夫子曾经说过：“三军可夺帅也，匹夫不可夺志也。”（长时间鼓掌。群众欢呼“加诺兄万岁！”）
    兄弟姐妹们，我重复一次，印度尼西亚民族以精神来战斗，中华民族也是以精神来战斗。精神是我们唯一最厉害的武器。对于这一点，敌人是不知道的。
    兄弟姐妹们，在昨天晚上的宴会上，亲爱的兄弟陈毅元帅曾经说过，当上海开始回到你们手中的时候，敌人方面曾说：“他们在上海住不了三个月”。但是实际的情况是，政府在这里已经屹立了七年之久。正如元帅先生昨天晚上所说的那样，它将永远屹立在这里！（长时间鼓掌）
    兄弟姐妹们，印度尼西亚人民从事战斗的情况也是这样。当我们在1945年8月17日宣布印度尼西亚独立的时候，我们手里空空如也，我们所拥有的不过四件东西：第一、已经有数千年历史的红白旗，第二、“大印度尼西亚歌”，第三、一纸宪法草案，第四、一纸独立宣言。除这以外，我们就什么也没有了。兄弟姐妹们，我们没有什么眼睛看得到的具体东西，我们没有什么物质的东西。可是，我们有一个不可摧毁的东西，那就是精神、精神、精神。我再说一次，精神！（鼓掌）兄弟姐妹们，当时我们有的就只是精神。敌人就不懂得精神的可贵，敌人讥笑我们说：“哼，1945年8月17日印度尼西亚共和国宣告成立。哼，这个印度尼西亚共和国维持不到十天的。”可是，事实呢，兄弟姐妹们，印度尼西亚共和国成立到现在，不只十天，不只十个星期，也不只十个月，而是已经十一个年头了。感谢真主，印度尼西亚一定要永远屹立在世界上。（全场热烈鼓掌，高呼“默地加”）
    我们屹立了十个星期之后，敌人这才知道他们估计错了。他们开始时说我们维持不到十天，可是，已经十个星期了，我们还是屹立着没有倒下去。接着，他们便发起进攻，他们使用武力来进攻我们，枪炮，炸弹和手榴弹等像骤雨般向我们倾泻过来。他们焚烧印度尼西亚的村庄，屠杀印度尼西亚的人民。可是，兄弟姐妹们，我们印度尼西亚就凭着精神来进行抵抗、抵抗、再一次抵抗。我们一直抵抗了五年，印度尼西亚青年的鲜血染红了印度尼西亚的国土，印度尼西亚农民的鲜血染红了印度尼西亚的国土，印度尼西亚工人的鲜血染红了印度尼西亚的国土。兄弟姐妹们！我们坚持战斗了五年，最后，帝国主义者不得不在1949年12月27日承认印度尼西亚民族的独立，承认印度尼西亚共和国。（长时间鼓掌。群众高呼“独立”！）
    兄弟姐妹们，在1949年，作为中华人民共和国人民斗争的结果，我们亲爱的兄弟毛泽东建立了中华人民共和国。1949年年底，荷兰承认了印度尼西亚共和国。不但如此，全世界也承认了她。继全世界承认印度尼西亚共和国之后，1950年年初，印度尼西亚共和国随即承认了中华人民共和国。（热烈鼓掌）
    兄弟姐妹们，在印度尼西亚共和国承认中华人民共和国以及中华人民共和国承认了印度尼西亚共和国之后，印度尼西亚共和国和中华人民共和国彼此就结成了朋友，共同前进，并且共同斗争。兄弟姐妹们，看吧，中华人民共和国的国旗和印度尼西亚的国旗双双飘扬，是多么的美啊，多么的美！兄弟姐妹们，我深信，这两国的国旗将永远飘扬在一起，美化着我们的天空。（群众鼓掌并高呼：中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚的友谊万岁！世界和平万岁！）
    是的，兄弟姐妹们，我们彼此是同志，是朋友，因为我们是战友，中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共同为反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义、建立新的世界和争取世界和平而并肩前进。中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚并且希望世界上一切国家，特别是亚洲和非洲各国的人民像万隆会议中所表现的那样交朋友，作同志，携手合作。
    兄弟姐妹们，去年万隆会议能够顺利进行的时候，没有任何人比加诺兄更加感激上帝的，这是因为我的信念和理想是只有依靠国际合作才能打倒国际帝国主义；如果亚洲和非洲各民族还没有团结一致，那就不可能彻底消灭帝国主义和殖民主义。
  （鼓掌）
    兄弟姐妹们，我刚才说过，我和孙逸仙博士都认为，民族的存在是应该的，是有好处的。各民族不但各有各的特点和特性，而且大家公认他们也各有各的象征。例如，中华民族的象征是龙，菲律宾民族的象征是水牛，越南民族的象征是多头蛇，暹逻民族的象征是白象，缅甸民族的象征是孔雀，印度民族的象征是神牛，埃及民族的象征是人面狮身，印度尼西亚民族的象征是野牛。所以在1929年，非常向往着亚洲和非洲大团结的我，当时曾这样说过，如果中国的龙同菲律宾的水牛、越南的多头蛇、缅甸的孔雀、暹逻的白象、印度的神牛、埃及的人面狮身、印度尼西亚的野牛合作的话，那么帝国主义和殖民主义必将全部消灭。（鼓掌）
    兄弟姐妹们，现在，亚洲和非洲人民的合作已经开始了，甚至亚非两洲人民同进步人民的合作也已经开始了。让我们继续前进吧！我们绝不会失败，我们一定会胜利。
    兄弟姐妹们，你们知道全世界有多少人口吗？全世界共有二十六亿人口。在这二十六亿人里面，三分之二以上站在我们这一方面。单是参加亚非会议的就已经有十六亿人，要是加上其他进步的人民，至少该有二十亿人。兄弟姐妹们，二十六亿人当中，有二十亿人在争取世界和平，争取和平共处，争取消灭帝国主义，争取消灭殖民主义，争取共同合作。世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡得住这一股由二十亿人汇成的洪流，兄弟姐妹们，谁敢这样做，他就会被这股洪流的巨浪吞没掉。（热烈鼓掌，全场高呼：和平万岁！）
    兄弟姐妹们，我再说一遍，来吧，我们继续前进！我们决不会失败，胜利一定属于我们。我们为什么一定会胜利呢？因为，人民就是我们的力量。人民就是印度尼西亚共和国力量的泉源，人民就是中华人民共和国力量的泉源。
    兄弟姐妹们，人民，它是胜利的保证。来吧，继续前进，我们并不是孤立的！印度尼西亚民族不是孤立的，中华民族也不是孤立的。巨大的浪潮现在正在汹涌澎湃着，这是人民的浪潮，各国人民的浪潮，有着各民族特性和特点的人民的浪潮。朋友们，战斗的人民，建立真正民主的人民是不会失败的！（鼓掌）
    兄弟姐妹们，我再重复一次，印度尼西亚人民就是印度尼西亚共和国的力量，中国人民就是中华人民共和国的力量。印度尼西亚人民根据自己的道路建立印度尼西亚的民主，中国人民根据自己的道路建立中国的民主。印度尼西亚人民是战斗的人民，中华人民共和国人民也是战斗的人民，因此，印度尼西亚的民主是战斗的民主，中华人民共和国的民主也是战斗的民主。
    兄弟姐妹们，你们和我们是战斗的民主的两大支柱。我们的民主是按照人民自己的愿望各有各的形式。兄弟姐妹们，刚才我说过，各民族不互相友好而互相冲突是不对的。然而，每一个民族都各有各的特点，同样的，各民族的民主也就各有各的特点。你们根据你们人民的特点把你们的民主叫做“人民民主”是对的，我们根据印度尼西亚人民的特点，把我们的民主叫做“潘查希拉”的民主也是对的。但是，你们的民主和印度尼西亚的民主，都是战斗的民主，都是为反对殖民主义和帝国主义而战斗、为争取幸福而战斗、为争取世界和平和实现美好的新世界而战斗的民主！（热烈鼓掌）
    兄弟姐妹们，让我们继续前进，并肩前进吧！我们的革命还没有完成，你们的革命也还没有完成，我们大家的革命都还没有完成。你们有台湾问题，我们有西伊里安问题。兄弟姐妹们，我们为争取把西伊里安归入印度尼西亚共和国的版图而奋斗，你们也在为争取把台湾归入中华人民共和国的版图而奋斗。大家应该一起前进。我们热爱和平，你们也热爱和平。我们准备根据收回西伊里安主权的原则同荷兰进行谈判。我知道，你们也来采用和平方式解决台湾问题。不错，兄弟姐妹们，印度尼西亚人民和中国人民都是热爱和平的。
    但是，世界上的人们应该知道，我们热爱和平，可是，我们更热爱独立。（鼓掌）
    朋友们，外界散播着一种谎言，一种天大的谎言。有人说，苏联人民不爱好和平，苏联人民是侵略成性的人民，是好战的人民，是喜欢侵犯别国的人民。他们同样又说，中华人民共和国人民不是爱好和平的人民，是好战的人民，是侵略成性的人民，是喜欢侵犯别国的人民。朋友们，我访问过苏联，现在我和中国人民在一起。我亲眼看到，全体苏联人民都热爱和平；我亲眼看到，全体中国人民都热爱和平。（热烈鼓掌，全场高呼：“和平万岁！”）
    朋友们，印度尼西亚人民也是爱好和平的。我们大家都热爱和平，中国人民热爱和平，印度尼西亚人民也热爱和平。我们热爱和平并不是因为我们软弱。我们热爱和平并不是因为我们软弱。我们热爱和平，因为对我们来说，和平是神圣的，和平应该是全人类的理想。（鼓掌。全场欢呼：“和平万岁！”）是的，朋友们，我再重复一次，我们大家热爱和平并不是因为我们感到自己软弱，不是的，我们并没有感到自己软弱。因为我们手里掌握着最有威力的武器——精神，战斗意志。这是我们最厉害的武器。我们没感到自己软弱。我们热爱和平是因为它是重要的、是神圣的。我们大家热爱和平，我们并且为实现世界和平全力工作。
    朋友们，每当我考虑到和平问题的时候，每当我想到世界和平问题的时候，我往往感到像是在作梦，在幻想，但是，我认为它是可能实现的。
    兄弟姐妹们，在太平洋的彼岸有美国，这边有中国，还有印度尼西亚、菲律宾等等国家。如果目前处于紧张状态的太平洋沿岸的民族、国家之间能够订立一个互不侵犯公约，那该是多么好啊！这样的公约将会消弥各国之间的战争。兄弟姐妹们，这样的理想经常充实着我，因为正像我刚才说过的那样，和平是一件重要的事情，是一种理想，是一个原则，它一定要成为我们共同斗争中的准则。（鼓掌。群众欢呼：“和平万岁！”）
    要是有了太平洋沿岸各国——包括加拿大、美国、墨西哥、拉丁美洲各国、日本、中华人民共和国、越南、菲律宾、印度尼西亚、缅甸、印度，甚至包括阿拉伯所有国家和埃及——都参加的互不侵犯条约，那么，所有的问题都可以通过和平的途径来解决。不但如此，人类将在和平和合作的气氛中和平共处。
  （长时间鼓掌）
    兄弟姐妹们，我再重复一次，对于我们——中华人民共和国人民，印度尼西亚人民，以及其他进步的人民，和平是重要的，是神圣的，我们将一直为世界和平而努力。我再说一次，我们热爱和平，并不是因为我们软弱。不。我说，我们热爱和平，可是，我们更热爱独立。我们是热爱和平的，兄弟姐妹们，可是，一旦我们的独立受到侵犯，我们就要为保卫我们的独立作殊死的战斗。（全场热烈鼓掌，高呼“和平万岁！”）
    印度尼西亚民族热爱独立，中华民族也热爱独立，我们大家都热爱独立。
    兄弟姐妹们，过去我在美国说过，我们决不出让任何一分独立给任何人，我们也决不出卖任何一分独立给任何人。我们将永远维护我们的独立！（鼓掌）　　我们要继续前进，我们要继续战斗下去！青年男女们，我特别要求你们，继续前进吧！热爱你们的祖国，热爱你们的民族，热爱你们的独立，热爱你们无数先辈为争取其实现而受难、而牺牲的理想！继续前进吧，将来的世界不是老年人的，将来的世界是属于你们的！将来的太阳是你们的，将来的月亮是你们的，将来的星星也是你们的。继续前进吧，青年男女们！兄弟姐妹们，老年人的力量是比不上青年人的。我在印度尼西亚时常拿老年人和青年男女的力量作比较，我说，要是给我一百万个老年人，我就可以把高山搬走；要是给我一百个青年，只要这一百个青年胸中充满炽烈燃烧着的战斗意志和战斗精神，那我就能够使整个世界完全改观。（鼓掌）
    兄弟姐妹们，我给你们带来了八千二百万印度尼西亚人民的问候；我给你们带来了印度尼西亚人民对你们的热爱。我不能长期同你们在一起，再过几天我就要离开中华人民共和国的国土了。兄弟姐妹们，我愿告诉你们，我在中华人民共和国逗留期间，更加坚信中国人民和印度尼西亚人民之间的兄弟般的友谊是永恒的和亲密无间的，人世间没有任何力量可以破坏这种兄弟般的友谊。正如我在鞍山所说过的那样，如果我们能够保持这种兄弟般的友谊，不仅保持、而且还把它加以千锤百炼，不断地加以千锤百炼，那么，这种兄弟般的友谊将会比你们的鞍山的钢铁还要坚硬，还要牢固。
    印度尼西亚有一句谚语：“远在天边，近在心田”。将来我离开了中华人民共和国，回到了印度尼西亚，那时，在我的眼睛里，你们是在数千公里之外。但是，请记住，中华人民共和国人民将永远靠近加诺兄的心，将永远靠近从沙璜一直到麦老加的全体印度尼西亚人民的心！（长时间鼓掌。群众欢呼“加诺兄！”）
    兄弟姐妹们，我是一位工程师，我从前的工作是建筑钢铁的桥梁。但是，我现在建筑的不是钢铁的桥梁，而是建筑从印度尼西亚到中国的兄弟般友谊的桥梁。我已经邀请毛泽东主席先生访问印度尼西亚，毛泽东主席已经接受了我的邀请。我希望，在不久的将来，毛泽东主席会来到印度尼西亚，他也将建筑桥梁，建筑从中华人民共和国到印度尼西亚的兄弟般友谊的桥梁。（长时间鼓掌。群众欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“苏加诺总统万岁！”“和平万岁！”）
    兄弟姐妹们：
    中华人民共和国万岁！（鼓掌）
    印度尼西亚共和国万岁！（鼓掌）
    中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚的友谊万岁！（鼓掌）
    世界和平万岁！（鼓掌）
    为实现新世界的斗争万岁！（长时间鼓掌、欢呼。苏加诺总统用中国话答称：“谢谢”。）
