    "Luanfeng Soap" Restores Original Advantages
    A letter from the Tianjin Municipal Public-Private Joint Tianjin Soap Manufacturing Company states: The article "Good Soap Turns Bad" published in the People's Daily on August 3rd, criticizing the deterioration in the quality of our factory's "Luanfeng Soap" product, is indeed true.
    In the first quarter of this year, our factory, due to a shortage of tallow raw materials, added 5% rapeseed oil to the "Luanfeng Soap" formula; however, after the formula change, it was put into production without good testing. This caused the soap to be soft. At the same time, because the formula was not appropriate, foaming occurred on the surface during soap making. Therefore, a small amount of alkaline solution was added during milling, which caused excessive free alkali content in the soap. This affected the lastingness of the fragrance, caused eye irritation, and brought trouble and losses to consumers. After discovering this problem, our factory added 15% coconut oil to the formula in the second quarter, restoring the original formula and overcoming the above shortcomings.
    In the future, we will also control the formula and key operating points well, and continuously improve product quality.

### “鸾凤香皂”恢复原有优点

    “鸾凤香皂”恢复原有优点
    天津市公私合营天津造胰公司来信说：人民日报8月3日发表的“好香皂变坏了”一文，批评我厂产品“鸾凤香皂”的质量变坏了，确是事实。
    今年第一季度，我厂因为牛油原料不足，曾在“鸾凤香皂”配方中加入了5％菜油；但是配方变更后，并没有很好的试验，就投入了生产。因而使香皂质软。同时又因为配方不适当，在制皂的时候发生表面起泡现象，于是在碾制时加入了少量碱液，又使得皂内含游离碱过多，影响到香味难以持久，并且产生辣眼情况，给消费者带来了烦恼和损失。我厂发现这个问题后，第二季度已在配方中多加了15％的椰子油，恢复了原来的配方，克服了以上缺点。
    今后我们还要很好地控制住配方和操作要点，不断提高产品质量。
