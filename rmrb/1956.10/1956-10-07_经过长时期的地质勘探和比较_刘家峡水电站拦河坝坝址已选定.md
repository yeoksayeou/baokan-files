Xinhua News Agency Report:

After a long period of geological exploration and comparison, the dam site for the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station has been selected.

In order to finalize the dam site area for the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry and the Gansu Provincial People's Committee and other units organized the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station Dam Site Selection Committee. They listened to the reports of the site负责人 one after another, and invited Soviet experts and heads of various departments to conduct repeated research and comparison on the site. Finally, Hongliugou was selected as the dam site area for the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station.

After a long period of geological exploration and comparison with several other dam sites, it has been proven that the Hongliugou dam site is a better one. Hongliugou is located at the lower entrance of Liujiaxia, with a water width of 40 to 60 meters, and steep cliffs of about 110 meters on both banks. Not only does the riverbed and both banks have suitable geological conditions for building a high dam, but there is also a wide construction site on the shore and nearby.

The surveying and mapping work of the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station started in 1952. Last year, more than a thousand employees were organized to carry out large-scale surveying, drilling, and geological survey work. The Dam Site Selection Committee expressed satisfaction with the results achieved by the employees, both in terms of quality and quantity.

Liujiaxia is a canyon with the most superior conditions for hydropower construction in the middle reaches of the Yellow River and is the ninth step in the Yellow River comprehensive utilization plan. It is about 50 kilometers away from Lanzhou, with an average annual flow of more than 800 cubic meters per second. After the dam is built, the flow during the dry season can be adjusted from 286 cubic meters per second to 470 cubic meters per second, and 5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity can be generated every year. After this giant hydropower station is completed, it will not only provide sufficient power to Lanzhou, Xining and other places, but also reduce waterlogging disasters below Lanzhou and greatly increase the irrigation area around Yinchuan. In addition, it also has great significance for improving shipping and reservoir fishery reproduction.

With the smooth completion of the dam site selection work, the Lanzhou-Liujiaxia Highway has also begun construction. The Lanzhou-Liujiaxia Railway is undergoing surveying and mapping, and various preparatory work before construction is being actively prepared.

    经过长时期的地质勘探和比较
    刘家峡水电站拦河坝坝址已选定
    新华社讯　刘家峡水电站的拦河坝坝址，已经选定。
    为了最后确定刘家峡水电站坝址区，电力工业部和甘肃省人民委员会等单位，组织了刘家峡水电站选坝委员会。他们先后听取了工地负责人的报告，并且请苏联专家们和各部门负责人到现场作了反复的研究比较，最后选定了红柳沟为刘家峡水电站坝址区。
    经过长时期的地质勘探，并且同另外几个坝址作了比较，证明红柳沟坝址是较好的一处。红柳沟位于刘家峡下口，水宽四十到六十公尺，两岸是一百一十公尺左右的峭壁，河底及两岸不仅有适宜建筑高坝的地质条件，而且岸上和附近有较宽广的施工场地。
    刘家峡水电站的勘测工作，是从1952年开始的。去年，曾经组织了千多名职工，进行了大规模的测量、钻探和地质勘验工作。选坝委员会对于职工们已经做出的成果，无论在质量方面或数量方面，都表示满意。
    刘家峡是黄河中游进行水电工程建设，条件最优越的一个峡谷，是黄河综合利用规划中的第九个阶梯。它距离兰州约五十多公里，年平均流量八百秒公方以上，拦河坝修成后可以使枯水时期的流量由二百八十六秒公方调节为四百七十秒公方，每年可以发电五十亿度。这一巨型水电站建成以后，不仅能供给兰州、西宁等地充足的电力，而且可以减轻兰州以下的水旱灾害，大大增加银川一带的灌溉面积。此外，对于改善航运和水库渔业繁殖等方面，也具有很大的作用。
    随着选坝工作的顺利完成，兰（州）刘（家峡）公路也开始施工了。兰（州）刘（家峡）铁路，正在进行勘测，施工以前的各项准备工作都在积极筹备中。
