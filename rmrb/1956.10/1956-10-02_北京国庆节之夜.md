    Beijing's National Day Night
    Tonight, after the autumn rain cleared in Beijing, more than 100,000 people gathered at Tiananmen Square to watch the fireworks display.
    The fireworks were diverse. At one moment, countless golden linked flowers soared into the sky, and at another, thousands of chrysanthemum-like fireworks scattered from the heavens. Illuminated by the rotating beams of searchlights, they appeared brilliantly dazzling. At this moment, Tiananmen Square transformed into a sea of people filled with laughter.
    Before nightfall, the parading crowds had already changed out of their rain-soaked clothes and flocked to Tiananmen in droves. In a very short time, East Chang'an Avenue and the streets leading from Qianmen to Tiananmen were packed with people, and buses and streetcars came to a halt.
    The jubilant crowd rapidly extended eastward and westward from Tiananmen Square for a total distance of four li. Nearly six hundred spotlights illuminated the area brightly. People danced and sang to their hearts' content on the autumn rain-washed pavements, and joyous laughter echoed in the night sky along with the festive music.
    More foreign guests than in previous years attended the celebration on the reviewing stands tonight. They were excited and cheered at the sight of the mass revelry. Some even captured the beautiful night scene with their cameras.
    Tonight, the entire city was immersed in joy, and people thronged the streets and alleys. All theaters, cinemas, and workers' clubs were packed to capacity tonight. Universities and factories far in the suburbs also held various evening parties, celebrating National Day night just like the people in Tiananmen Square. (Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch)

    北京国庆节之夜
    北京今晚秋雨初霁，有十多万人民在天安门广场观赏礼花和焰火。
    礼花焰火是多种多样的。一时有无数腾空而起金光闪闪的连珠花，一时又从天空散下千百种菊花似的礼花。它们在探照灯的巨光转动中，显得鲜丽夺目。这时候，天安门广场变成一个欢笑声沸腾的人海。
    夜幕还没有降临，游行的人们就早已换下了被雨淋湿的衣服，成群结队地涌向天安门。在很短的时间，东长安街和前门通往天安门的各条街道，都挤满了人，汽车和电车都停驶了。
    狂欢的人海从天安门广场迅速向东、西伸延了共四华里远。近六百只聚光灯把这一带照得遍地通明。人们踏着秋雨洗过的路面，尽情的歌舞，欢乐的笑声随着狂欢乐曲在夜空回荡。
    在观礼台上，今晚来的外宾也比往年多。他们看到群众的狂欢情景，有的激动欢呼。有的还把美丽的夜景摄入了镜头。
    今夜，全城浸沉在欢乐中，大街小巷，人们川流不息。各剧场、影院和工人俱乐部今晚都客满。远在郊外的大学、工厂也举办了各种晚会，同天安门广场上的人们一样欢度国庆节之夜。（新华社1日讯）
