Xinhua News Agency, 22nd - The delegation of the Parliament of the Republic of India left Beijing by plane this morning and will return home via Wuhan, Guangzhou and other places.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi greeted the distinguished guests at the airport.

The head of the delegation, A. Ayyangar, made a farewell speech at the airport. He said: We came as friends, and now we are going back as your better friends.

He also said: Your country is like a rising sun, the night is over, now there is only light, no country can oppress you anymore; I hope Western countries are more realistic and recognize you as representatives of the Chinese people; it would be of great benefit to the whole world the day the People's Republic enters the Security Council.
