The Ministry of Agriculture Notifies All Regions
To Carry Out Winter Prevention and Control of Crop Diseases and Insect Pests

    (Our report) The Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China issued a notice in early October to agricultural departments in various regions regarding the implementation of winter prevention and control of overwintering crop diseases, insect pests, bird pests, and animal pests. The notice stated: Winter is a favorable time to prevent and control overwintering crop diseases, insect pests, bird pests, and animal pests. Various regions should carry out prevention and control work in the following aspects: 1. Prevent and control overwintering rice diseases and insect pests: The rice stem borer, which is the most serious pest of rice, mostly lies dormant in the rice roots during the winter. Combined with accumulating and producing fertilizer, adopt methods such as digging, hoeing, splitting, pulling, and picking, according to local conditions, to properly treat all rice roots containing borers, which will kill the overwintering borers. In areas where the Asiatic rice borer and other pests are severe, cut and destroy all remaining wild rice plants and eliminate weeds along the edges of fields to eliminate overwintering sites for pests.
    2. Corn borers, sorghum stem borers, millet stem borers, and other pests mostly hide in corn, sorghum, millet, and other stalks, stubble, and panicle axes during the winter. Various regions should adopt methods such as composting, using them as feed, and using them as fuel to process various stalks and eliminate them during the overwintering stage.
    3. Cleaning cotton fields, searching for and destroying residual stalks, fallen leaves, and fallen fruit, eliminating weeds, deep plowing, and centralized treatment of diseased and insect-infested cotton stalks are all important measures to eliminate overwintering cotton diseases and insect pests. In areas where fruit trees are planted, prune withered, diseased, and insect-infested branches of fruit trees in winter, sweep away fallen leaves and fallen fruit, and combine antifreeze whitewashing with spraying protective agents to eliminate overwintering diseases and insect pests.
    4. Potato late blight and sweet potato black rot are two serious diseases that affect the production of tubers. Various regions should remember the lessons learned and do a good job in storing tubers this year, slice and dry diseased and damaged tubers or grind them into powder for processing to avoid cellar rot. The storage of seed potatoes should be especially strengthened.
    5. This year, the autumn locust egg-laying was delayed, and many locust areas were flooded. Provinces in locust areas must plan carefully and actively carry out and do a good job in egg survey work.
    6. In areas where bird and animal pests are severe, trapping should be carried out during the winter slack season. During the organization of trapping, attention must be paid to the safety of humans and livestock and the protection of beneficial birds and animals, rare animals, and animals with high economic value (such as deer, musk deer, otters, giant pandas, etc.).

    农业部通知各地
    开展农作物病虫害冬季防除工作
    本报讯　中华人民共和国农业部10月上旬向各地农业部门发出关于开展冬季防除过冬病虫害鸟害兽害工作的通知。通知说：冬季是防除过冬农作物病虫害、鸟害、兽害的有利时机。各地从以下几个方面进行防除工作：1、防治水稻过冬病虫：为害水稻最严重的稻螟，大部分潜伏在稻根内过冬，结合积肥、造肥，因地制宜地采用挖、掘、锄劈、拔、拾等办法，把有螟虫的稻根全部加以适当处理，就能杀死越冬螟虫。在二化螟和其他害虫严重地区，要齐泥割毁茭白遗株和铲除田边杂草，消灭害虫过冬处所。
    2、玉米螟、高粱条螟、栗灰螟等害虫，大部潜藏在玉米、高粱、谷子等秸秆、根茬、穗轴里过冬，各地应该采取沤肥、作饲料、作燃料等方法处理各种秸秆，把它们消灭在过冬阶段。
    3、清洁棉田，搜毁残株落叶、落果，铲除杂草，进行深耕，集中处理病虫棉秸，都是消灭过冬棉病虫的重要措施。种植果树的地区，应该在冬季修剪果树枯、病、虫枝，扫除落叶、落果，结合防冻涂白，喷布保护药剂，消灭过冬病虫。
    4、马铃薯晚疫病和甘?黑斑病是影响薯类生产的两种严重病害。各地应记取教训，做好今年薯类贮藏工作，把病、伤薯块切片晒干或磨粉加工，避免发生烂窖。对种薯的贮藏尤应加强管理。
    5、今年秋蝗产卵延迟，不少蝗区被水淹没，蝗区各省必须周密计划，积极开展和做好查卵工作。
    6、害鸟害兽严重的地区，应当利用冬闲进行捕捉。组织捕捉中，必须注意人畜的安全和保护益鸟、益兽，稀有动物以及经济价值较高的动物（如鹿、麝獐、水獭、大小熊猫等）。
