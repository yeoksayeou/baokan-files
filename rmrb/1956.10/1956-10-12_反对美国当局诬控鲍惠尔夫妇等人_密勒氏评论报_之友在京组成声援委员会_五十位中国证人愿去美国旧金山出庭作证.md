Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Fifty Chinese witnesses have stated their willingness to testify on behalf of J.W. Powell, former editor of the "China Monthly Review," his wife, and their assistant Julian Schuman when they are tried in San Francisco on charges of sedition. This was announced today by Louis [Lou] Ayre, chairman of the Support the "China Monthly Review" Editor Powell Committee, which was established in Beijing.

Among these fifty people are: Li Dequan, chairman of the Investigation Team on American Imperialist Bacteriological Warfare Crimes and president of the Chinese Red Cross; Liao Chengzhi, deputy chairman of the investigation team; entomologist Dr. Liu Chongle, medical doctor Tang Feifan, and other scientists, bacteriologists, and witnesses who witnessed the American aerial delivery of bacteriological weapons, who investigated the American bacteriological warfare against China and Korea during the Korean War. They will testify that the reports of American bacteriological warfare, which Washington accuses Powell of fabricating, are in fact true.

Louis [Lou] Ayre, who was once a contributor to the "China Monthly Review," a publication with a thirty-five-year history, founded in Shanghai, said it was forced to cease publication in 1953 because the United States banned its delivery, depriving it of its main readership. He said, "If Powell's defense lawyers in San Francisco need more witnesses, we can find five hundred more in China."

The committee currently consists of sixteen members. The chairman is New Zealand writer Louis [Lou] Ayre, who has long been a contributor to and supporter of the "China Monthly Review." The vice-chairman and secretary, Geng Lishu, is a former national committee worker of the American Young Women's Christian Association and a long-time subscriber to the "China Monthly Review." The other vice-chairman, Tang Mingzhao, is a friend of these American journalists. The treasurer, Chen Meijie, is a British woman who was the assistant editor of the magazine.

The other members are former colleagues of the Powell couple, contributors and subscribers to the "China Monthly Review," or their close friends. Ayre said that as the committee expands its work and the movement progresses, many more people will join.

He went on to say that the committee's main purpose is to mobilize all possible forces to help in the case of the Powell couple. He said, "There are many things that can be done to help the defendants win."

In a statement released at a press conference today, Ayre praised the Powell couple for "reporting the truth as they saw it, an act faithful to the fine traditions of journalism."

The Powell couple returned to the United States in 1953 after the "China Monthly Review" ceased publication, and the US government filed charges against Powell three years after their return. Speaking of this fact, Ayre said that this practice is "a continuation of the policy of intimidating American journalists to prevent them from coming to China and telling the truth."

Geng Lishu said that the US government waited until the 1956 presidential election year because it wanted to stop calls for a change in foreign policy.

She said that the American people's friendly feelings towards China are growing, and they are increasingly feeling that China should obtain its legitimate position in the United Nations. She said, "This is something the US government does not want."

    反对美国当局诬控鲍惠尔夫妇等人
    “密勒氏评论报”之友在京组成声援委员会
    五十位中国证人愿去美国旧金山出庭作证
    新华社11日讯　五十位中国证人已经声明愿意为前“密勒氏评论报”主编约·威·鲍惠尔，他的妻子和他们的助理朱利安·舒曼行将在旧金山以煽动叛乱罪受审的时候作证。这是今天在北京成立的声援“密勒氏评论报”编辑鲍惠尔委员会主席路易·艾黎宣布的。
    这五十个人中包括：美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团主席、中国红十字会会长李德全，调查团副主席廖承志，曾经调查过美国在朝鲜战争期间对中国和朝鲜进行的细菌战的昆虫学家刘崇乐博士、医学博士汤飞凡和其他的科学家、细菌学家和目睹美国空投细菌武器的证人。他们将要作证，华盛顿指控鲍惠尔捏造的关于美国进行细菌战的报道，事实上是真实的。
    路易·艾黎曾经是“密勒氏评论报”的撰稿人，这家刊物有三十五年的历史，创刊于上海，因为美国禁止寄递美国失去主要读者而在1953年被迫停刊。他说，“如果鲍惠尔在旧金山的辩护律师要更多的见证人的话，我们在中国还可以找到五百个。
    委员会目前暂时由十六人组成。主席是新西兰作家路易·艾黎，长期以来，他一直是“密勒氏评论报”的撰稿人和支持者。副主席兼秘书耿丽淑是前美国女青年会全国委员会干事，是“密勒氏评论报”多年的订户，另一位副主席唐明照，是这些美国新闻工作者的朋友。司库陈梅洁是这家杂志的助理编辑，她是一位英国妇女。
    其他的委员都是鲍惠尔夫妇以前的同事、“密勒氏评论报”的撰稿人和订户，或者是他们的密友。艾黎说，随着委员会扩充工作和运动的开展，还会有许多人参加。
    他接着说，委员会主要目的是要在对鲍惠尔夫妇的案件进行帮助方面动员一切可能动员的力量。他说：“在帮助被告胜诉方面有许多事情可以做”。
    在今天记者招待会上发表的一篇声明中，艾黎赞扬鲍惠尔夫妇“报道他们所看到的真相是忠于新闻工作的优秀传统的行为”。
    鲍惠尔夫妇是在1953年“密勒氏评论报”停刊后回到美国去的，美国政府在他们回国三年以后提出对鲍惠尔的控告。艾黎在谈到这个事实的时候说，这种做法是“恫吓美国记者使他们不敢到中国来和说出真相的政策的继续”。
    耿丽淑说，美国政府所以等到1956年总统选举年，是因为它想制止要求改变外交政策的呼声。
    她说，美国人民对中国友好的情绪日益增长，他们愈来愈觉得中国应当在联合国取得它的合法的位置。她说：“这是美国政府所不希望的事。”
