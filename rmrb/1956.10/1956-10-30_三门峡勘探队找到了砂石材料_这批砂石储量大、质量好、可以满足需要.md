Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 28th. The exploration work for sand and gravel materials for the construction of the Sanmenxia Water Control Project on the Yellow River has recently been completed.

    The source of these sand and gravel materials is in the Jian River, Lingbao County. Exploration results prove that the natural sand and gravel materials produced in this area are of good quality and abundant in reserves. According to calculations, this production area has more than 6 million cubic meters of natural sand and gravel materials, which can meet the needs of building the Sanmenxia Water Control Project.

    Sand and gravel are one of the important materials for building the Sanmenxia Water Control Project dam. The sand and gravel material exploration is to find sand and gravel with large reserves, good quality, short transportation distances, and convenient mining conditions. In order to find a sand and gravel production area suitable for the above needs, the staff of the Building Materials Team of the Sanmenxia Geological Exploration Brigade traveled all the large and small tributaries on both sides of the Yellow River near Sanmenxia from June last year. Later, they selected four production areas: Lingbao Jian River, Chou Sang River, Nan Jian River, and Shijiatan, with the sand and gravel from Lingbao Jian River being the best. Since the autumn, the last and more detailed exploration of the Lingbao Jian River production area has been carried out.

    三门峡勘探队找到了砂石材料
    这批砂石储量大、质量好、可以满足需要
    据新华社郑州28日电　为建筑黄河三门峡水利枢纽进行的砂石材料勘探工作，已经在最近完成。
    这个砂石材料产地在灵宝县的涧河。勘探结果，证明这个地区产的天然砂石材料质量好，储量丰富。据计算，这个产区共有天然砂石材料六百多万公方，可以满足建筑三门峡水利枢纽的需要。
    砂石是建筑三门峡水利枢纽大坝的重要材料之一。砂石材料勘探就是为了找到储量大，质量好，运输距离近，开采条件方便的砂石。为了找到适合以上需要的砂石产地，三门峡地质勘探总队建筑材料队的职工，从去年6月起，走遍了三门峡附近黄河两岸的大小支流。后来选择了灵宝涧河、稠桑河、南涧河、史家滩四个产区，以灵宝涧河的砂石为最好。入秋以来，又对灵宝涧河产区进行了最后一次更详细的勘探。
