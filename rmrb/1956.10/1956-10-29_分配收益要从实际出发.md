Distributing Income Should Start from Reality
Zhang Qingtai
The income distribution work of agricultural production cooperatives is inherently quite complex; this year is the first year in which the basic realization of agricultural cooperation has been achieved nationwide, and there are some issues that require special attention in the income distribution work. This work cannot be done well by simply talking about "adhering to the principle of distribution according to labor" or mechanically emphasizing "adhering to the contract labor and output scheme." It is necessary to conduct specific analyses of specific situations and adopt flexible methods suitable for various specific situations. It should not start from the original plan, but from reality.

		About Contracting Labor
How should cooperatives that implement year-round contract labor distribute income? Should it be distributed to each team based on the total contract labor of the entire cooperative, and then distributed to the members by each team based on their actual labor days? It cannot be done so simply. At present, the unit work quotas formulated in various places are generally about 20% inaccurate. Since the contract labor is estimated based on the quotas for comprehensively various complex works on thousands and tens of thousands of acres of land, it will naturally not be completely accurate, and the phenomenon of being too high or too low between teams is almost inevitable. Many cooperatives do not contract labor based on work quotas but based on estimates, which is even less likely to be accurate. Therefore, it must be based on trial calculation and pre-distribution to prove that the labor day remuneration between teams is generally balanced before the distribution can be carried out according to the original contract labor. Otherwise, arduous and meticulous adjustment and balancing work must be carried out. The actual labor days of each team cannot be completely consistent with the original contract labor. Distributing to each team according to the contract labor of each team, and then distributing to the members by each team based on actual labor days, will inevitably produce differences in the value of each labor day between teams. If specific analysis is not done on the specific situation, and the distribution is carried out in a general way according to the original contract labor, it is possible to deviate from reality and deviate from the masses.

It may be helpful to give an example to illustrate: In the Hanjiagou Cooperative in Dingxian County, the general quota management is done better, and the work points between teams are generally balanced. In the summer harvest distribution, the cooperative, according to the contract labor and output method, distributed to each team according to the total contract labor of the entire cooperative, and then distributed to the members by each team based on the actual labor days. As a result, each of the forty-six teams in the cooperative had different labor day remuneration, and the difference in remuneration per labor day between the teams ranged from three liang to one jin and fifteen liang of wheat. Zhang Caoer of the 25th team and Zhang Baoyin of the 28th team had the same labor strength, the same technical level, and both attended work for one hundred and ten days. Zhang Caoer received 106.5 labor days, and Zhang Baoyin received 102.9 labor days. The remuneration for each labor day in the 25th team was five jin and one liang, and Zhang Caoer received 539 jin and two liang of wheat; the remuneration for each labor day in the 28th team was three jin and four liang, and Zhang Baoyin only received 334 jin and six liang of wheat. This shows that Zhang Baoyin received 204 jin and twelve liang less than Zhang Caoer, which is obviously very unfair. It is extremely common for the labor situation between teams to be the same and the labor remuneration to differ by dozens of jin. According to our understanding of several cooperatives, all those that distribute according to the contract labor without any changes have similar unreasonable phenomena without exception.

The reasons for this unreasonable phenomenon are: the contract labor itself is inaccurate, being too high or too low between teams; the management committee's unbalanced allocation of labor also creates a difference; in addition, there are other complex reasons. From this, it can be seen that cooperatives that implement contract labor must not distribute in a general way according to the original contract labor; it is not enough to simply adjust and balance work points. For example, in the aforementioned Hanjiagou Cooperative, the work points between teams were originally generally balanced; however, distribution according to the contract labor still cannot achieve fairness and rationality. We tried to distribute according to the actual labor days in this cooperative, and the unified remuneration for each labor day in the entire cooperative should be four jin of wheat. According to this remuneration, Zhang Caoer can receive 426 jin, and Zhang Baoyin can receive 411 jin and ten liang. Doing so can achieve basic fairness and rationality. It is not difficult to understand that, in this case, distributing according to the actual labor days is precisely dealing with the problem starting from reality. Mechanically emphasizing distribution according to the contract labor may unconsciously fall into the quagmire of subjectivism. Of course, if the scoring standards between teams are inconsistent, and the work point difference is large, distribution according to the number of workdays is also unfair.

		About Contract Output and Rewards and Penalties
Contract labor and output generally include provisions for "rewards for overproduction and penalties for reduced production." At present, many regions have further stipulated that more rewards should be given and fewer penalties should be imposed, and only artificial reductions in production must be penalized. These provisions are correct in principle. However, in specific implementation, it is still necessary to conduct specific analyses of specific situations. For example, regarding the issue of increased or reduced production, it cannot be simply determined by comparing the actual output of a certain team with its contract output target. This is because the contract output target is also not completely accurate, and there are often cases of being too high or too low between teams. To determine whether production has increased or decreased, it is necessary to combine the democratic evaluation of the masses and make necessary adjustments to the contract output target. At the same time, it is necessary to specifically analyze the real reasons for increased or decreased production. Only in this way can it truly play the role of educating the masses to improve technology. Some cooperatives simply and generally compare the actual output with the contract output target to determine rewards and penalties. As a result, some teams that are not actively engaged in production but only have relatively superior natural conditions are rewarded, while teams that are truly engaged in intensive cultivation are not rewarded. There is no need to prove that this sloppy practice has a bad influence on the masses. In fact, even if production has truly increased, it cannot be entirely attributed to one team. The leadership of the management committee is in-depth and specific, the supply of materials is timely, and the allocation of labor is reasonable, which also plays a big role. Therefore, attention should also be paid to rewarding those advanced individuals who have contributed to the production of the entire cooperative. As for the issue of penalties, it should be handled with even greater caution. The so-called "artificial reduction in production" cannot be simply and generally borne by all members of a team. "Artificial reduction in production" may have many reasons: ① the management committee's supply of materials is not timely or the allocation of labor is unreasonable; ② the management committee does not pay attention to work points, the contract labor and output quotas are unreasonable, or they are not promptly revised according to specific changes, which affects the production mood of the masses and reduces labor productivity; ③ the production team leader is weak and does not allocate labor well, resulting in idling; ④ the production team leader's work style is not good, and the labor mood of the masses is depressed. In addition, since the expansion and merger of cooperatives, the management committee is not familiar with the soil characteristics and crop rotation of all cultivated land, and the unsuitable or unreasonable planting of some crops also affects the harvest to varying degrees. These complex situations can be resolved through the democratic evaluation of the masses, and a generally correct conclusion will be reached. There is no benefit in simply imposing penalties without specifically analyzing the specific situation.

Some regions stipulate that the penalty limit should not exceed 10%-15% of the total number of labor days in the production team throughout the year. Is this limit too high? It is worth considering. After the collectivization of the basic means of production, a farmer relies entirely on his hard work for a year's income; what is the impact if 10%-15% is deducted? According to our understanding, the production of some penalized teams is not bad. No wonder some members said angrily: "The current contract output does not distinguish between right and wrong, and it is a head-on blow! It's really like a dumb person eating bitter melon, unable to express the suffering!" Can we consider: This year, because both cadres and the masses lack experience, the general contract output is not accurate, and there are phenomena of being too high or too low in the contract output targets between teams, and the reasons for the reduction in production are not that simple. Therefore, in general, only rewards should be given and no penalties should be imposed. For some teams that have not completed the contract output task, the reasons should be specifically analyzed, and serious and appropriate criticism should be given when summarizing the work. Only for those teams that have indeed caused a reduction in production due to irresponsibility, if the majority of members are dissatisfied if no penalty is imposed, then a reduction in labor days may be considered. Doing so will not dampen the enthusiasm of the masses for production.

		About the Imbalance of Work Points
Some agricultural production cooperatives have neither implemented contract labor and output, nor have they had effective control and balancing methods for work points at ordinary times; therefore, the work points are extremely inconsistent between teams, individuals, and individuals in the same cooperative. There is a difference of three or five points on the same labor and the same type of work per day, and some accumulate a difference of three or five hundred points or even more in a year. In addition, the wrong and missed records of work accounts in some cooperatives have brought great difficulties to the autumn harvest distribution. For this kind of cooperative, it is necessary to first effectively help them clean up the work accounts. In cleaning up the work accounts, several able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers with the same conditions can be selected, and repeatedly compared to find out the differences in the work points of male and female members between teams; it is also necessary to analyze the reasons for the differences based on some typical examples. Then, the management committee will put forward a preliminary work point adjustment plan, mobilize the masses for democratic discussion, and after repeated revisions, achieve general balance, and then determine the final autumn harvest distribution plan, which will be finally approved by the members' congress or the members' representative congress. Facts have proved that where this is done carefully and meticulously, the income distribution is relatively fair and reasonable; where the distribution is carried out sloppily on the basis of the original chaotic work points, it has aroused dissatisfaction among the members.

		About the Remuneration of Cooperative Cadres
Regarding the issue of remuneration for cooperative cadres, although there are general provisions in various places, there are no specific provisions for the remuneration standards for large and small cooperatives and various full-time and part-time cadres. In some cooperatives, there are more full-time and part-time cadres, and some cooperative cadres' work points for non-direct participation in production labor are too many, accounting for 5%-6% of the total number of workdays. In the summer harvest distribution in some regions, the labor remuneration of cadres was given according to the actual scoring without any changes; in the autumn harvest distribution, some regions are prepared to strictly reduce it by 50% or even more. This issue should also be treated with great caution. Because most cadres are good, and they have shown great enthusiasm during and after the high tide of cooperation, working early and late. According to the evaluation of the masses, "Even if they have no merit, they still have worked hard!" Moreover, due to the long-term separation of politics and society after the establishment of the cooperative, and the involvement of various parties, cooperative cadres have also missed a lot of work. Of course, there are indeed a few cadres who are not actively engaged in work, and they also record work points for going to the market and visiting relatives, or as the masses commented: "Full-time is full-time, nothing is managed, they don't get up in the morning, and they shout blindly when they go to the fields." This should be treated differently. It is best not to be too rigid in the regulations from above; in some places, the deductions for cooperative cadres are too harsh, and the masses do not agree. Democratic discussions should be conducted by the masses under leadership to ensure that each cooperative cadre receives at least the equivalent of the remuneration received by the same labor force. This will not affect the lives of cooperative cadres, nor will it dampen their enthusiasm. Such democratic discussions are of educational significance for both cadres and the masses.

    分配收益要从实际出发
    张庆泰
    农业生产合作社的收益分配工作，本来就是一件相当复杂的工作；今年是全国范围内基本实现农业合作化的第一年，在收益分配工作中更有一些需要特别加以注意的问题。这个工作决不是只笼统地说一说“坚持按劳分配的原则”或者机械地强调“坚持包工包产方案”就可以做好的。必须对具体情况进行具体分析，采用适合各种具体情况的灵活的办法。不应该是从原方案出发，而应该是从实际出发。
          关于包工
    实行常年包工的合作社怎样进行收益分配呢？是否一律按全社各队总包工数分配到各队，再由各队分别按其实际用工数分配到社员呢？不能这样简单从事。现在各地制定的单位的单项工作定额，一般还约有20％左右不准确。包工数既然是在成千成万亩土地上综合各种复杂的工作的定额所估算出来的，它自然不会完全准确，队与队间偏高偏低的现象几乎是不可避免的。有许多社不是根据工作定额而是根据估计数包工的，那就更不容易准确了。因此，必须根据试算预分，证明队与队间劳动日报酬大体是平衡的，才可以按原包工数进行分配。否则就必须进行艰苦细致的调整平衡工作。各个队的实际用工数不可能同原来的包工数完全一致。按各队包工数分配到各队，再由各队分别按实际用工数分配给社员，就不可避免地会产生队与队间每个劳动日的价值的差别。如果对具体情况不加具体分析，而笼统地按原包工数进行分配，就有可能脱离实际，脱离群众。
    这里不妨举个实例来说明：定县韩家洼合作社，一般定额管理做得比较好，队与队间工分大体平衡。在夏收分配中，这个社根据包工包产办法，按全社总包工数分配到各队，再由各队分别按实际用工数分配给社员。结果，全社四十六个队各有不同的劳动日报酬额，每个劳动日的报酬在各个队间的差额，从三两到一斤十五两小麦。这个社第二十五队张槽尔和第二十八队张保印劳动强弱相同，技术高低相同，出勤都是一百一十天。张槽尔得劳动日一百零六点五个，张保印得劳动日一百零二点九个。第二十五队每个劳动日的报酬是五斤一两，张槽尔分得小麦五百三十九斤二两；第二十八队每个劳动日报酬是三斤四两，张保印仅分得小麦三百三十四斤六两。这里表明，张保印比张槽尔少分二百零四斤十二两，这显然是很大的不公平。各个队间劳动情况相同而劳动报酬相差几十斤的，极为平常。根据我们在若干合作社的了解，凡是按包工数原封不动进行分配的，毫无例外地存在着类似的不合理现象。
    产生这种不合理现象的原因是：包工本身不准确，队和队之间偏高偏低；管委会调配劳力不平衡，又造成一种差别；此外，还有别的复杂的原因。由此可见，实行包工的合作社，绝不能笼统地按原包工数进行分配；只靠简单的调整平衡工分也不行。如上述韩家洼社，队与队间工分本来大体是平衡的；但按包工数进行分配仍不能做到公平合理。我们试行对这个社按实际用工数进行分配，则全社每个劳动日的统一报酬额应是小麦四斤。按照这个报酬额，张槽尔可分得四百二十六斤，张保印可分得四百一十一斤十两。这样做反而可以达到基本公平合理。不难理解，在这种情况下，按实际用工数进行分配，正是从实际出发处理问题。机械地强调按包工数进行分配，就有可能不自觉地陷入主观主义的泥沼中去。当然，如果队和队之间记分标准不一，工分差别较大，按用工数进行分配，也是不公平的。
        关于包产和奖罚
    包工包产中一般都有“超产受奖、减产受罚”的规定。目前，许多地区又进一步规定：应当多奖少罚，只有人为的减产才必须予以处罚。这些规定在原则上都是正确的。但在具体执行的时候，仍然必须对具体情况进行具体分析。如增产减产问题，不能简单地把某个队的实产量同它的包产指标对比一下就判定。这是因为包产指标也是不尽准确的，在队与队间也常有偏高偏低的情况。要判明增产了或者是减产了，必须结合群众的民主评议，对包产指标进行必要的调整。同时，要具体分析真正增产减产的原因。这样做，才会真正起教育群众改进技术的作用。某些合作社只是把实产量同包产指标简单地笼统地对比一下即定奖罚，结果，有些生产不够积极、只是自然条件比较优越的队受了奖，真正精耕细作的队反而没有受奖。无须证明，这种草率的做法在群众中的影响是不好的。其实，即使真正增产的，也不能完全归功于一个队。管委会的领导深入具体，物资供应及时，劳力调配合理，也起很大作用。因此，应当同时注意奖励那些对全社生产有功的先进人物。至于罚的问题，更应该十分慎重处理。所谓“人为的减产”，也不可简单地笼统地由一个队的全体成员来负责。“人为的减产”可能有很多原因：①管委会物资供应不及时或劳力调配不合理；②管委会对工分不注意，规定的包工包产数额不合理，或者没有根据具体情况的变化及时修正，影响了群众的生产情绪，降低了劳动生产率；③生产队长能力弱，对劳力支配不好，造成窝工现象；④生产队长作风不好，群众劳动情绪消沉。此外，由于合作社扩大合并以后，管委会对全部耕地的土壤特性及其轮作情况不熟悉，若干作物种植的不适宜或不合理，也在不同程度上影响了庄稼的收成。这些复杂情况，只要通过群众的民主评议，就会在大体上得出正确的结论。对具体情况不加具体分析，而简单地施行处罚，是没有什么好处的。
    某些地区规定处罚的限额不得超过生产队全年劳动日总数的10％—15％，这种限额是否太高了呢？值得考虑。在基本生产资料公有化之后，一个农民全靠双手辛勤劳动一年的收入；如果被罚掉10％—15％，其影响如何？据我们了解，有些受罚的队，生产搞的并不坏。无怪有些社员愤慨地说：“现在的包产是不分青红皂白，迎头一棒子！真是哑子吃黄连，有苦说不出！”可否考虑：今年由于干部和群众都缺乏经验，一般包产既不准确，队与队间的包产指标又有偏高偏低的现象，加上造成减产的原因不那样简单，因此，一般的可以只奖不罚。对于某些没有完成包产任务的队，应具体分析原因，在总结工作的时候，给以严正而适当的批评。只有对那种确系由于不负责任而造成减产的队，如果不处罚则大多数社员不满的时候，再行酌情扣减劳动日。这样做就不会挫伤群众的生产积极性。
        关于工分的不平衡
    有些农业生产合作社既没有实行包工包产，平时对工分又缺乏有效的控制和平衡的办法；因此，在同一社内队与队、个人与个人间工分高低极不一致，同样劳力同样工种有一天相差三、五分的，积累起来有的一年相差三、五百分甚至更多。加以部分合作社工账的错记漏记，这就给秋收分配带来了很大困难。对这种社，必须首先切实帮助他们清理工账。在清理工账中，可选择若干各种条件相同的整劳力和半劳力，反复对比，找出队与队间男女社员工分差别的情况；还要根据一些典型事例，分析形成差别的原因。然后，由管委会提出初步的工分调整方案，发动群众民主讨论，经过反复修正，做到大体平衡，再行确定秋收分配的决算方案，交由社员大会或社员代表大会最后通过。事实证明，哪里这样认真细致地做了，收益分配就比较公平合理；哪里在原来混乱的工分基础上草率地进行分配，就引起了社员的不满。
        关于社干部的报酬
    社干部报酬问题，各地虽有一般的规定，但对于大社小社以及各种脱产与半脱产的干部的报酬标准，还没有具体的规定。在部分合作社里，脱产、半脱产的干部是多了些，有些社干部非直接参加生产劳动的工分太多，以至占总用工数的5％—6％。有些地区在夏收分配中按实际记分原封不动，给了干部的劳动报酬；在秋收分配中，有些地区准备严格削减50％甚至更多。对待这个问题，也应当采取十分慎重的态度。因为大多数干部是好的，在合作化高潮中及其以后，他们起早贪黑，表现了很大的积极性。按照群众的评语就是：“没有功劳还有苦劳呢！”而且由于建社以后长时期政社不分，各方牵扯，社干部也误了不少工。当然，确有少数干部工作并不积极，赶集串亲戚也记工，或如群众所评论的：“脱产脱产，啥也不管，早晨不起床，下地就瞎喊。”这是应当区别对待的。最好不要由上边规定的太死；有的地方把社干部扣的太苛，群众并不同意。应该有领导地由群众民主讨论，做到使每个社干部至少得到相当于同等劳动力所得到的报酬。这样既不会影响社干部的生活，又不致挫伤他们的积极性。这样民主讨论，对干部和群众都是有教育意义的。
