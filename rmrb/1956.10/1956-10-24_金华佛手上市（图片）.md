    Jinhua Buddha's Hand Enters the Market
    The fresh Buddha's hand fruit from Xihu Village in Jinhua is now on the market. Besides being processed into Chinese medicine, the Buddha's hand is also a very good ornamental item; people who love Buddha's hand can now buy fresh Buddha's hand with its intoxicating fragrance. This is Wu Shunjia, a farmer from Xihu Village in Jinhua County, Zhejiang, picking fresh Buddha's hand.

    金华佛手上市
    金华西湖村的新鲜佛手上市了。佛手除经过加工后作中药外，还是一种很好的观尝品；喜爱佛手的人们，今年可以买到香气逼人的新鲜佛手。这是浙江金华县西湖村农民吴顺嘉正在采摘新鲜佛手。
