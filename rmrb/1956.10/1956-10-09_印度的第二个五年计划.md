　　India's Second Five-Year Plan
　　Nan Zhang
    India's second five-year plan for economic construction was recently discussed and approved by the People's Chamber of the Indian Parliament. It was formulated after the achievements of the first five-year plan, focusing on the development of state-owned enterprises and heavy industry. The implementation of this plan will undoubtedly help India's economic independence and further consolidate India's political independence, and therefore it is welcomed and supported by the Indian people.
    India is a large country with vast land and abundant resources and a large population. Its resources are very rich. Iron ore reserves account for about 25% of the world's total, manganese accounts for 15%, mica accounts for 60%, and there are also rich deposits of copper, tungsten, gold, vanadium, zinc and other minerals. Historically, the Indian people once had a highly developed economy and culture, but for nearly three centuries, Western colonialism's exploitation and oppression of India has resulted in India's economic backwardness.
    After India gained independence in August 1947, it began to eliminate the malpractices left over from British colonial rule, and the Indian economy began to move forward along the road of independent development.
    In 1950, the Indian government formulated the first five-year plan (April 1951 to March 1956). Its main task was to develop agriculture and build comprehensive water conservancy projects to improve India's long-standing food production shortage, while developing a portion of state-owned industries. This plan has now been completed, with national income increasing by 18%, food production increasing by 20%, and cotton and hemp production basically achieving self-sufficiency. Many giant hydroelectric power stations and irrigation projects have been completed, and several newly built state-owned factories have been put into production.
    However, the first five-year plan has not yet solved many of the basic problems of the Indian economy. First, India's heavy industry is still weak. In 1955-56, the entire industry accounted for only 17.7% of the national income, and most of it was light industry and handicrafts. Secondly, many important economic sectors in India are still controlled by foreign capital, and foreign capital has increased in recent years. According to a report published by the Reserve Bank of India, the total amount of foreign private investment in India at the end of 1953 reached 4.193 billion rupees (of which Britain accounted for 82%), an increase of 1.317 billion rupees compared with June 1948. Thirdly, India's unemployment problem urgently needs to be solved. According to official estimates, the current national unemployment population is about 5.3 million (2.5 million in cities and 2.8 million in rural areas), and another 10 million people will need employment in the next five years. At the same time, the living standards of the Indian people also urgently need to be improved.
    In response to these situations, the Indian National Congress passed a resolution in January 1955 to establish a "socialist type society," requiring the implementation of social ownership of major means of production, increasing the speed of development of production, fair distribution of national wealth, and elimination of unemployment. According to this resolution, the Indian government formulated the second five-year plan (April 1956 to March 1661). The plan stipulates that its main objectives are: (1) to increase national income by 25%; (2) to rapidly realize industrialization, focusing on the development of basic industries and heavy industries; (3) to expand employment opportunities; (4) to reduce inequality in income and wealth and evenly distribute economic power. In order to achieve these goals, the Indian government has adopted a policy that is actually developing state capitalism, that is, expanding public enterprises, restricting the development of private capital in certain industrial sectors, and nationalizing certain economic sectors. This kind of state capitalism in India is different from the state monopoly capitalism of highly developed capitalist countries. It will help restrict the development of private monopoly capital and will enhance India's national economic strength, thereby weakening the control of foreign capital over the Indian economy. Prime Minister Nehru announced: "In the future, all basic industries should be wholly owned by the state," and "Small and medium-sized industries should be owned by cooperatives."
    The total investment in the second five-year plan is 71 billion rupees, of which the public sector is 48 billion rupees and the private sector is 23 billion rupees. The production targets and investment allocation for the public sector as stipulated in the plan are as follows:
    The investment in the mining industry is 8.9 billion rupees, accounting for 18.5% of the total public investment, which is a large increase compared with the 9% in the first five-year plan. 6.9 billion rupees will be used for large-scale mining and the remaining 2 billion rupees will be used for rural industries and small industries. The production targets for various major industrial products are: steel will increase from 1.3 million tons to 4.3 million tons, coal will increase from 38 million tons to 60 million tons, the output value of machine tools will increase from 7.5 million rupees to 30 million rupees, the output of diesel engines will increase from 100,000 horsepower to 250,000 horsepower, the output of locomotives will increase from 175 to 400, various chemical fertilizers will increase from 500,000 tons to 2.17 million tons, and cotton textiles will increase from 6.85 billion yards to 8.5 billion yards.
    Expenditure on irrigation and electricity is 9.13 billion rupees, accounting for 19% of the total public investment. Among them, the funds for developing irrigation and flood control are 4.86 billion rupees, and the funds for developing electricity are 4.27 billion rupees. The irrigated area will increase from the existing 67 million acres to 88 million acres, and the power generation capacity will increase from 3.4 million kilowatts to 6.9 million kilowatts.
    The appropriation for transportation is 13.85 billion rupees, accounting for 28.9% of the public sector investment, of which two-thirds is used for the development of railway transportation. The plan is to build 850 miles of new railways and more than 18,000 miles of highways, and increase the tonnage of inland and ocean-going ships by 300,000 tons.
    Expenditure on agriculture is 5.68 billion rupees, accounting for 11.8% of the total expenditure of the public sector. It is estimated that the output of agricultural products will increase by 18%, of which food production will increase by 30% (from 65 million tons per year to 85 million tons), cotton production will increase by 31% (from 4.2 million bales per year to 5.5 million bales, each bale weighing about 400 pounds), and jute production will increase by 25% (from 4 million bales per year to 5 million bales). The plan also stipulates that land reform will be carried out rapidly, stipulating the highest limit for land ownership and developing rural cooperation.
    The appropriation for social welfare undertakings such as education and health reached 9.45 billion rupees, accounting for 19.7% of the total expenditure of the public sector.
    In addition, the plan also stipulates that unemployment will be eliminated within ten years, and 9.6 million people will be employed within five years. The main method is to expand employment opportunities through the development of small industries and handicrafts.
    The goals and policies of the second five-year plan have been supported by the people and parties across India. The Communist Party of India issued a statement saying: "The main goals of the plan will be welcomed by every patriotic Indian, and the people of the whole country must work hard to achieve these goals." The Indian People's Socialist Party, the Socialist Party and other parties also expressed their welcome to the plan. Only a few monopoly capitalists, feudal forces and agents of foreign capital opposed the second five-year plan. They clamored that the second five-year plan would lead to "totalitarianism" and openly opposed the expansion of the public sector and the implementation of nationalization, emphasizing that the "enthusiasm of the private sector" should be brought into play. They also opposed the development of heavy industry, and demanded that emphasis be placed on the development of agriculture and light industry. But these claims were not adopted by the Indian government.
    The second five-year plan has now begun to be implemented. In order to develop heavy industry, the Indian government established the Ministry of Steel Industry in 1955, started to build three huge state-owned steel plants and expand existing steel plants, and actively carried out exploration work on coal, oil, and metal deposits. The Indian government is also preparing to vigorously develop technical education and train technical talents. At the same time, the Indian government has also taken some measures in developing state capitalism. In 1955, the Imperial Bank controlled by British capital was nationalized. This year, the life insurance business, the Oriental Shipping Company, and the Kolar Gold Mine were nationalized one after another, and preparations were made to nationalize some coal mines, copper mines, and diamond mines. The National Trading Company was established in May this year to strengthen the country's position in foreign trade.
    But the second five-year plan also faces some difficulties. The first is the problem of funding. According to the plan, the funds for the public sector will be obtained from various taxes of 8 billion rupees; 12 billion rupees will be obtained from the issuance of public bonds and the promotion of small savings; 1.5 billion rupees will be obtained from the profits of state-owned railways; and 2.5 billion rupees will be obtained from budgetary savings and other accumulated deposits. The above totals 24 billion rupees, which only accounts for half of the planned total investment in the public sector, and the other half of the shortfall will be made up from the following sources: issuing 12 billion rupees in additional banknotes, 8 billion rupees in foreign aid, and 4 billion rupees will be mainly obtained from domestic sources through increased taxes and other methods.
    In addition to funding problems, there are also difficulties in terms of technicians and machinery and equipment. The second five-year plan requires a large number of technicians and imports of machinery and equipment worth 13.5 billion rupees. In the past, India mainly relied on Western countries in this regard. During the first five-year plan, India received about 3 billion rupees in aid and loans from the United States, Britain and other countries, of which 2 billion rupees were actually used, but more than half of them were surplus grains, and did not provide India with enough technology and machinery and equipment to build a large factory. Imperialism has even refused to sell certain machinery and equipment to India. As India's "National Herald" pointed out: "So far, the West is not enthusiastic about using economic aid to help India build factories that produce means of production."
    These difficulties cannot be ignored, but the Indian people have sufficient strength to overcome them. Prime Minister Nehru said it well that, in the final analysis, the Indian people's ability, talent and energy are enormous. As long as there is full cooperation from the people, the second five-year plan can undoubtedly be completed. People have also noticed some suggestions made by the Indian people to solve the difficulties. They advocated nationalizing more monopolistic foreign enterprises, restricting corporate profits and levying property taxes on the rich, and advocated obtaining construction funds through expanding state-owned enterprises. They also hoped to pay more attention to the development of heavy industry to lay a solid foundation for industrialization.
    China, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are very concerned about India's economic development and are actively carrying out economic and technical cooperation with India to promote each other's economic upsurge. The Soviet Union is now helping India build a metallurgical plant with an annual output of 1.3 million tons of steel, and is assisting India in mineral exploration. The Soviet Union has agreed to supply India with 1 million tons of steel in the next three years, and will also help India establish a technical college and a state-owned mechanized farm. India and China have also exchanged experiences on issues such as water conservancy, irrigation and agricultural cooperation. In addition, Czechoslovakia, Democratic Germany, Poland, Yugoslavia and other countries have also signed technical mutual assistance agreements or trade and shipping agreements with India respectively to help India develop coal, oil, sugar and other industries.
    The Chinese people are carrying out the construction of the national economy, and naturally attach great importance to every achievement of our great neighbor on the road of economic development, are willing to learn from its useful experience, and sincerely hope that the mutual assistance and cooperation between China and India in the cause of economic development will become increasingly close.

　　印度的第二个五年计划
　　南章
    印度经济建设的第二个五年计划最近在国会人民院讨论通过了。它是在第一个五年计划已经获得成就之后拟定的，着重于发展国营企业和重工业。这个计划的实现，无疑将有助于印度经济的独立和进一步巩固印度的政治独立，因而受到印度人民的欢迎和拥护。
    印度是一个地大物博、人口众多的大国。它的资源十分丰富，铁矿蕴藏量约占世界的25％，锰占15％，云母占60％，此外还有丰富的铜、钨、金、钒、锌等矿藏。在历史上，印度人民曾经有过高度发展的经济和文化，但是近三个世纪以来，西方殖民主义对印度的剥削和压迫，造成了印度经济的落后状况。
    1947年8月印度获得独立后，就开始着手消除英国殖民统治时期所留下的恶果，印度经济开始沿着独立发展的道路前进。
    1950年，印度政府制定了第一个五年计划（1951年4月至1956年3月）。它的主要任务是发展农业和建设综合水利工程，以改善印度长期存在的粮食生产不足的状况，同时发展一部分国营工业。这个计划现在已经完成，国民收入增加了18％，粮食产量增加了20％，棉麻产量基本上已达到自给。许多巨型水电站和灌溉工程已经竣工，新建的若干国营工厂已投入生产。
    但是，第一个五年计划还没有解决印度经济上的许多基本问题。首先，印度的重工业还薄弱，1955—56年度全部工业在国民收入中只占17.7％，而其中主要是轻工业和手工业。其次，印度的许多重要经济部门至今仍受外国资本控制，而且外国资本近年还有所增加。据印度储备银行发表的报告说，1953年底在印度的外国私人投资总额达四十一·九三亿卢比（其中英国占82％），比1948年6月时增加了十三·一七亿卢比。再次，印度失业问题急待解决，据官方估计，目前全国失业人口约为五百三十万（城市二百五十万，乡村二百八十万），而且今后五年中还将增加一千万需要就业的人口。同时，印度人民的生活水平也急需提高。
    针对这些情况，印度国大党于1955年1月通过了一个建立“社会主义类型社会”的决议，要求实行主要生产资料的社会所有制、提高发展生产的速度、公平分配国家财富、消灭失业现象。根据这一决议，印度政府制定了第二个五年计划（1956年4月至1661年3月）。计划规定它的主要目的是：（一）增加国民收入25％；（二）迅速实现工业化，着重发展基本工业与重工业；（三）扩大就业机会；（四）减少在收入与财富上的不平等，平均分配经济权力。为了达到这些目的，印度政府采取了实际上是发展国家资本主义的方针，即扩大公营企业、限制私人资本在某些工业部门的发展、对某些经济部门实行国有化等。印度的这种国家资本主义同高度发达的资本主义各国的国家垄断资本主义是有区别的。它将有助于限制私人垄断资本的发展，并将增强印度民族经济力量，从而削弱外国资本对印度经济的控制。尼赫鲁总理宣布：“在将来，一切基本工业应全部归国家所有”，“中小工业归合作社所有”。
    第二个五年计划投资总额为七百一十亿卢比，其中公营部分为四百八十亿卢比，私营部分为二百三十亿卢比。计划所规定的生产指标和公营部分的投资分配如下：
    对工矿业的投资为八十九亿卢比，占全部公营投资的18.5％，这与在第一个五年计划中所占的9％比起来已有很大增加。其中的六十九亿卢比将用于大工矿业，其余二十亿卢比将用于乡村工业和小工业。各种主要工业品的生产指标为：钢材由一百三十万吨增至四百三十万吨，煤由三千八百万吨增至六千万吨，工作母机产值由七百五十万卢比增至三千万卢比，柴油机产量由十万马力增至二十·五万马力，机车产量由一百七十五台增至四百台，各种化学肥料由五十万吨增至二百一十七万吨，棉织品由六十八·五亿码增至八十五亿码。
    用在灌溉和电力方面的开支为九十一·三亿卢比，占全部公营投资的19％。其中发展灌溉和防洪的经费为四十八·六亿卢比，发展电力的经费为四十二·七亿卢比。灌溉面积将由现有的六千七百万英亩增至八千八百万英亩，发电能力将由三百四十万瓩提高到六百九十万瓩。
    对交通运输的拨款为一百三十八·五亿卢比，占公营部分投资的28.9％，其中三分之二用于发展铁路运输。计划新建铁路八百五十英里、公路一万八千多英里，将内河和远洋轮船的吨位增加三十万吨。
    农业方面的支出为五十六·八亿卢比，占公营部分总支出的11.8％。农产品产量预计将增加18％，其中粮食增产30％（由年产六千五百万吨增至八千五百万吨），棉花增产31％（由年产四百二十万包增至五百五十万包，每包约四百磅），黄麻增产25％（由年产四百万包增至五百万包）。计划还规定迅速进行土地改革，规定持有土地的最高限额、发展农村的合作化等。
    对教育卫生等社会福利事业的拨款达九十四·五亿卢比，占公营部分总开支的19.7％。
    此外，计划还规定在十年内消灭失业，在五年内使九百六十万人就业，主要方法是通过发展小工业和手工业来扩大就业机会。
    第二个五年计划的目标和方针，受到印度全国人民和各党派的拥护。印度共产党发表声明说：“计划的主要目标将受到每一个爱国的印度人的欢迎，全国人民必须为实现这些目标而努力。”印度人民社会党、社会党和其他党派也都对计划表示欢迎。反对第二个五年计划的只有少数垄断资本家、封建势力和外国资本的代理人。他们大嚷第二个五年计划会导向“极权主义”，并公开反对扩大公营部分和实行国有化，强调应发挥“私营部分的积极性”。他们还反对发展重工业，而要求着重发展农业和轻工业。但他们这些主张没有被印度政府所采纳。
    现在第二个五年计划已经开始实行。为了发展重工业，印度政府在1955年成立了钢铁工业部，着手建立三个巨大的国营钢铁厂和扩大现有钢铁厂，并积极开展对煤、石油、金属矿藏的勘探工作。印度政府还准备大力发展技术教育，培养技术人材。与此同时，印度政府在发展国家资本主义方面也采取了一些措施，1955年将英国资本控制的帝国银行收归国有，今年又先后将人寿保险事业、东方轮船公司、科拉尔金矿等收归国有，并准备使一些煤矿、铜矿和金刚石矿国有化。今年五月又成立了国家贸易公司，以加强国家在对外贸易中的地位。
    但第二个五年计划也面临着一些困难。这首先是资金问题。按照计划规定，公营部分的资金将从各种税收取得八十亿卢比；从发行公债与推行小额储蓄收入一百二十亿卢比；从国营铁路的利润取得十五亿卢比；从预算中的节约资金与其他积存款项取得二十五亿卢比。以上共计二百四十亿卢比，只占公营部分预定投资总额的一半，其余的一半缺额将用下列来源来弥补：增发纸币一百二十亿卢比，外国援助八十亿卢比，尚有四十亿卢比将主要通过增税等办法从国内取得。
    除资金问题外，在技术人员与机器装备方面也存在着困难。第二个五年计划需要大量技术人员和进口价值一百三十五亿卢比的机器装备。过去印度在这方面主要依靠西方国家。在第一个五年计划期间，印度从美英等国得到援助和贷款约三十亿卢比，实际动用的有二十亿卢比，但其中半数以上是剩余粮食，而没有为印度提供足够的技术和机器装备来建立一所大型工厂。帝国主义甚至还曾拒绝出售某些机器装备给印度。正如印度“国民先驱报”指出的：“到目前为止，西方并不热心于用经济援助来帮助印度建立生产工具的工厂。”
    这些困难是不容忽视的，但印度人民有着充分的力量来克服它。尼赫鲁总理说得好，归根到底，印度人民的能力、才干和精力是巨大的，只要有人民的充分合作，第二个五年计划无疑是可以完成的。人们还注意到印度人民所提出的一些解决困难的建议。他们主张将更多的垄断性的外国企业收归国有，限制企业利润和征收富有者的财产税，并主张通过扩大国营企业等办法来获得建设资金。他们还希望更加重视发展重工业，以奠定工业化的巩固基础。
    中国、苏联及其他社会主义国家对印度的经济发展抱着极大的关怀，并积极同印度进行经济和技术合作，以促进彼此经济的高涨。苏联现在正在帮助印度建立一座年产一百三十万吨钢的冶金工厂，并正协助印度进行矿产勘探工作。苏联已同意在最近三年中供给印度一百万吨钢材，还将帮助印度建立一所技术学院和一所国营机械化农场。印度和中国也曾就水利灌溉和农业合作化等问题交换了经验。此外，捷克斯洛伐克、民主德国、波兰、南斯拉夫等国也都分别和印度签订了技术互助协定或贸易航运协定，帮助印度发展煤、石油、制糖等工业。
    中国人民正在进行国民经济的建设工作，自然十分重视我们的伟大邻邦在经济发展道路上的每一个成就，愿意学习它所创造的有益经验，并热诚地希望中印两国在经济发展事业中的互助合作日益紧密。（附图片）
