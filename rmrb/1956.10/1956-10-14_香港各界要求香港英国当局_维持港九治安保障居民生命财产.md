Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th: Hong Kong compatriots are universally demanding that the Hong Kong British authorities take the most effective measures to quell the riots.

	A businessman named Zhuang Wuxue wrote a letter to Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao on the 12th, saying: Kuomintang secret agents have carried out large-scale acts of murder, arson, sabotage, and looting in broad daylight in a planned and organized manner, causing innocent harm and losses to legitimate shops and good residents, making it impossible for our shops to operate, students unable to attend school, and causing panic. I hope that the Hong Kong British authorities will quickly take extraordinary measures to suppress these thugs and severely punish them.

	Zhuang Wuxue's letter also stated: I am a legitimate businessman, and I stand on the side of justice. I have the right to demand that the Hong Kong British authorities take necessary measures to maintain social order and prevent similar incidents from happening again.

	In addition, twelve readers of Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao wrote to the newspaper, saying that more than two million residents from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon clearly realize from this incident that the bandits who directed this riot disregard the lives of the people and their property, and are in fact the public enemy of everyone. The letter said that we, the residents of Hong Kong, have the right to demand that the Hong Kong British authorities severely punish the instigators of the riots in order to protect the lives and property of the residents and maintain social order.

	Ma Wenhui, a person in charge of the Hong Kong Residents' Association, told a reporter from Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po yesterday that "the Kowloon riots were an organized, planned, and directed riot. This incident was organized by secret agents and some hooligans, and the target of the attack was obviously our Chinese compatriots. He hopes that this riot will subside as soon as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th: Hong Kong news: Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao" and "Wen Wei Po" continue to publish commentaries today demanding that the Hong Kong British authorities severely punish the culprits and quickly stop the riots instigated by Kuomintang secret agents in Kowloon.

	The "Ta Kung Pao" editorial said that the Kowloon riots directed by Kuomintang secret agents have lasted for three days and nights and have not been completely suppressed. Although the Hong Kong British authorities implemented emergency measures on the evening of the 11th, the atrocities continue to spread, and are becoming increasingly cruel and terrifying. Hong Kong residents whose lives and property are threatened cannot but hope that the Hong Kong British authorities will more resolutely suppress the atrocities of the rioters. The editorial said that at this critical moment, any slight tolerance of the rioters' atrocities is a dereliction of duty to the safety of residents' lives and property. Residents all hope that the Hong Kong British authorities will take a more resolute attitude and more severe measures to severely punish the ringleaders, suppress the stubborn, warn the coerced, and persuade the blindly following, so as to quickly restore social security and order.

	The "Wen Wei Po" editorial said that what more than two million residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon are currently very concerned about is: whether the riots will spread to Hong Kong, and whether there will be greater harm. Nearly two thousand rioters are extremely rampant, and have repeatedly threatened to attack Hong Kong's newspapers, schools, and trade unions. If the Hong Kong British authorities cannot prevent and suppress them as soon as possible, the scope of the riots will become wider and more uncontrollable, and the people's lives and property will be even more unprotected. The editorial said that therefore, we urgently hope that the Hong Kong British authorities will resolutely implement strict measures and no longer allow the riots to expand or continue.

	Today, the "Hong Kong Commercial Daily" also published a commentary saying that in the past few days, the villains have been able to openly act perversely in Kowloon, looting, burning, and killing. In the Tsuen Wan area, dozens of people were beaten to death alive, which is truly outrageous. The commentary said that the situation in Kowloon was relatively calm on the evening of the 12th. It is hoped that the riots will no longer have the opportunity to occur and spread, and that the social stability and order of Hong Kong and Kowloon can be quickly restored from now on. This is what the vast majority of Hong Kong residents eagerly hope for.

    香港各界要求香港英国当局
    维持港九治安保障居民生命财产
    新华社广州13日电　香港消息：香港同胞纷纷要求香港英国当局切实采取最有效的措施，平息骚乱。
    一个名叫庄务雪的商人12日写信给香港大公报说：国民党特务竟在光天化日之下，作出有计划有组织的大规模杀人、放火、捣乱、洗劫的暴行，使正当的商店和善良的居民受到了无辜的伤害和损失，使我们商店无法营业，学生无法上学，弄得人心惶惶。我希望香港英国当局迅速采取非常手段来镇压这批暴徒，同时要严厉惩办。
    庄务雪的信中又写道：我是一个正当商人，我站在正义立场，有权利要求香港英国当局作出必要措施来维护社会安宁，防止以后再发生类似事件。
    另外有十二个香港大公报的读者写信给这家报纸说，全港九各界二百多万居民从这次事件中清楚地认识到指挥这次暴动的匪徒，不恤民命，不顾民财，实际上是大家的公敌。信里说，我们香港居民，有权要求香港英国当局为保障居民的生命财产，为维持社会治安对暴动的指使者加以严厉处分。
    香港居民总会负责人员马文辉昨日又对香港文汇报的记者发表谈话说：“九龙骚动事件是一个有组织、有计划、有指挥的暴乱。这次事件由特务分子和一些流氓组织起来，攻击的对象很明显地是我们的中国同胞。他希望这个骚动平息下去，越早越好。
    新华社广州13日电　香港消息：香港“大公报”和“文汇报”今日继续发表评论要求香港英国当局严惩祸首，迅速制止国民党特务分子在九龙策动的暴乱。
    “大公报”的社论说，由国民党特务分子指挥的九龙暴乱持续了三昼夜，尚未被完全压制。虽然香港英国当局11日晚起实施了紧急措施，但暴行仍继续蔓延，而且益加残酷与恐怖，受到生命财产威胁的香港居民不能不希望香港英国当局对于暴徒的暴行，予以更坚决的压制。社论说，在此紧急时际，任何对暴徒暴行的丝毫纵容，就是对于居民生命财产安全的失责。居民们都希望香港英国当局以更加坚决的态度，更加严厉的手段，严惩首恶，压制凶顽，警告胁从，劝导盲从，以迅速恢复社会安全与秩序。
    “文汇报”的社论说，港九二百多万居民目前非常关心的是：暴乱是否会蔓延香港，是否会有更大的危害。近两千暴徒猖獗至极，一再扬言要大打香港的报馆、学校和工会，如果香港英国当局不能及早防范，迅加压制，则暴乱范围愈广，愈发不可收拾，人民生命财产也就更加无由保障。社论说，因此，我们迫切希望香港英国当局坚决执行严厉措施，不要再让暴乱扩大或延续下去。
    今日，“香港商报”也发表评论说，几天来歹徒们竟然能在九龙公开倒行逆施，虏掠烧杀，在荃湾地区竟有数十人被活活打死，真是闻之发指。评论说，12日晚九龙的情况比较平静，但愿从此暴乱不再有机会发生和蔓延，港九的社会安定秩序从此能迅速恢复，这是广大香港居民所殷切盼望的。
