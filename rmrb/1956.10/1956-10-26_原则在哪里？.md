	Where are the Principles?
	I am reporting to you with anger about the serious violation of principles in the distribution of hardship subsidies, as revealed at the fifth members' congress of the trade union at State-owned Factory 296. The state allocated a sum of money to our factory to subsidize workers with difficulties, so that they could better fulfill this year's state plan. This is something all the factory workers are very grateful for. However, the factory's trade union, which directly controlled this subsidy work, did not do a good job. A total of 102 workers in the factory received special hardship subsidies, totaling 6,168 yuan. However, the 14 trade union cadres, including union chairman Zhao Zhonghe and vice-chairman Liu Weiguo, alone subsidized themselves with more than 1,184 yuan, accounting for more than 18% of the total subsidy.
	The problem is not this percentage, but whether these full-time trade union cadres should receive subsidies at all. Looking at their living conditions, the lowest average household income per person among the 14 full-time trade union cadres is around 10 yuan per month, and the highest is over 37 yuan; none of them have ever been in debt due to natural disasters or illness or other special circumstances. For example, Zhang Jinfu did not apply for a subsidy, but Liu Weiguo said: "Trade union cadres have worked hard, this is the organization's consideration." He gave him a subsidy of 80 yuan, and he accepted it. Vice-chairman Shen Xingfa has savings in the bank, and this time he was also subsidized with 100 yuan. Zhao Zhonghe has a family of five, and his wife and he have a monthly income of 75.55 yuan, but because of his extravagant lifestyle, he already had a leather overcoat and then bought a very expensive otter collar overcoat (his wife once boasted to neighbors: "Just the collar alone is worth more than 100 yuan"). When he went on a business trip, he also visited West Lake in Hangzhou, and only then did he incur a debt, and this time he was subsidized with 300 yuan. Cai Shiming originally had savings in the bank, and this time he received a subsidy again and bought a watch worth 140 yuan.
	These trade union committee members are really too "concerned" about themselves, but how do they treat others? They forget the suffering of others, so that those who should be subsidized are not subsidized. For example, Comrade Zhou Wenlin has a low salary and a large family, and has filled his stomach with bean dregs, but he did not receive a subsidy this time. The masses are very dissatisfied with this unreasonable phenomenon, especially with the words of Zhao Zhonghe and Liu Weiguo. Zhao Zhonghe once said to labor protection committee member Cheng Linsen: "Those with more money have difficulties with more money, and those with less money have difficulties with less money"; Liu Weiguo said: "Take this opportunity to subsidize a little more if you want to subsidize." They really say what they do, and their words and actions are consistent!
	Comrade Editor, I am reporting this matter to you mainly to prevent similar situations from happening in the future. This problem is serious at present, and I request you to publish it.

    原则在哪里？
    我以愤怒的心情向你们报告一下，在国营二九六厂工会第五届会员大会上，揭发的工会在困难补助工作上严重违反原则的问题。国家给我们厂拨来一笔钱，作为补助厂里困难职工的费用，以便使他们更好地完成今年国家计划。这是全厂职工非常感谢的。但直接掌握这次补助工作的厂工会，没把好事作好。全厂受特殊困难补助的职工共一百零二名，合计人民币六千一百六十八元。可是只工会主席赵中和副主席刘卫国等十四个工会干部就补助了一千一百八十四元多，占全部补助金的18％多。
    问题不在这个百分比，而在于这些工会专职干部该不该受补助。从他们的生活情况来说吧，十四名专职工会干部的家庭生活水平，最低的平均每个月每人在十元左右，最高有的达三十七元以上；他们没有一个人因自然灾害或生病等特殊情况欠过债。如张金甫本来没有申请补助，刘卫国说：“工会干部辛苦了，这是组织上的照顾。”给他补助了八十元，他也接受了。副主席申兴发在银行有存款，这次也补助了一百元。赵中和五口人，夫妇二人每月工资收入七百五十五分，可是他因为日常生活铺张浪费，本来有一件皮大衣，又买了一件价值很高的水獭皮领大衣（他爱人曾向邻居夸耀说：“只一个领子就值一百多元”），他出差时又到杭州游西湖，才欠下了一笔账，这次也补助了三百元。蔡时明本来在银行里有存款，这次又得到了补助，买了价值一百四十元的手表。
    这些工会委员们，对自己真是太“关心”了，可是对待别人怎么样呢？他们忘掉别人的疾苦，使应该得到补助的反而没有得到补助。如周文林同志工资少，人口多，生活困难，曾以豆渣饼充饥，这次就没有补助。群众对这种不合理的现象非常不满。特别是对赵中和和刘卫国说的话有意见。赵中和曾对劳保委员程林森说：“钱多有钱多的困难，钱少有钱少的困难”；刘卫国说：“趁此机会要补助就补助多一点”。真是说得出就干得出，言行一致！
    编辑同志，我向你们报告这件事主要是为今后不再有类似情况的发生，目前这个问题是严重的，我要求你们刊登。　朝国
