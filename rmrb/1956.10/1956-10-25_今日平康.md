    Today's Pyonggang
    Zhong Ce
    Friends! You often ask in your letters, "How is Korea recovering?" On this sixth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' departure to fight in Korea, let me give you a report!
    Friends! Have you ever been to or heard of Pyonggang? Pyonggang is a small town north of the 38th parallel. Now, like other war-torn towns in Korea, it has risen from the ruins and become even more beautiful.
    In mid-June 1953, I first passed through Pyonggang. At that time, it had already been severely damaged by the war. At first, we only saw a chaotic expanse of weeds. Upon closer inspection, we discovered traces of the city beneath the overgrowth. Who could have imagined it? A beautiful, peaceful town, now with hardly a wall left standing. Weeds grew low over the rubble. Bomb craters connected like a large pond. Broken millstones, charred telephone poles, lay across the center of the street, a crooked mailbox standing forlornly by the roadside. We walked in silence, through the ruins of this deserted town. A fire of anger burned in our hearts. Hatred for the imperialist aggressors and sympathy for the Korean people drove us to quicken our pace and head swiftly to the front lines of battle.
    Soon after, the armistice came. For the first time in three years, the sound of gunfire ceased. From our positions, we looked at Pyonggang, at the quiet, desolate fields, and thought of its owners.
    One day in early October of that year, several comrades and I passed through here again. We unexpectedly saw an Ajumoni (Korean for "elder sister") emerge by the roadside. She was wearing a clean white blouse and black skirt, carrying a full jar of water on her head. When she saw us, her eyes filled with excitement, and she stared at us. As she approached, she seemed about to say something, her lips moved, and then she brushed past us and walked into a small path. We looked down the path and saw a simple thatched cottage built at the foot of the mountain. In front of the cottage, some baskets and household goods hung on a tree stump that had been stripped bare by a bomb. An old yellow ox lay under the tree, chewing grass. An Abeoji (old grandfather) with white hair was bent over, weaving something. "Ah! They're back!" we exclaimed in unison. We ran forward to greet the old man, stroked the old ox, and looked at all the things they had brought back.
      "Old man! You've suffered enough! But you're finally back, and we'll come and help you," we said to the old man, but he didn't understand. He nodded and gestured, repeating in simple Chinese, "Volunteer Army Dongmu (comrades), you have worked very hard, you have worked very hard." He seemed to be seeing his own relatives, and his wrinkled face glowed with excitement. We cheered from the bottom of our hearts, "The owners of Pyonggang have finally returned!" We were excited and moved for a long time.
    Soon after, we heard news that the Korean government had sent eight thousand villagers back. This news invigorated the hearts of every soldier on the front lines. As these villagers successively appeared in many settlements, many teams to help the Korean people rebuild their homes came down from the positions. Some were helping to repair houses, some were helping to repair brick kilns. Some came to repair the damaged lake dams, and some came to build new schools. They cut grass in the desolate fields to build houses, and they felled timber in the high mountains more than twenty miles away. In the past, trucks and carts hauling grain and ammunition were now running on the road loaded with seeds and wood. Soldiers who used to fight the enemy with guns in their hands had now become workers, busy on construction sites. Under the slogan "Let the Korean people have a good home sooner," they extended their daily eight-hour workdays to more than ten hours. Comrade Li Mingde, a member of a certain unit, broke his foot but still insisted on working. The director of a Korean brick factory said, "A Volunteer Army soldier does the work of one and a half people." In this way, they helped the returning villagers to build many houses on the ruins in one winter.
    Winter passed, and the first peaceful spring arrived in Pyonggang. The cuckoo called very, very early. Then, the tractors came and plowed up the three-year-old grass roots and turned over the red, oily soil in the fields covered with black ash. Groups of villagers in white clothes were in the fields, planting red flags, filling bomb craters, singing songs, and sowing seeds in rows. From our positions, during the day, we watched the green seedlings grow, and saw the scattered, wriggling white and green dots [note] in the rice paddies. At night, we looked out at the village, watching the twinkling lights like stars, counting their number. From our positions, we ate fresh vegetables brought by the villagers. At the banquet to which they invited us, we tasted newly brewed yellow wine, and together we beat the dishes and sang the song "Along the Nakdong River."
    The days passed quickly, and with each day and night, the fields and villages here were changing from their desolate wartime appearance. Everything had changed, so much so that you would no longer dare to recognize it. This spring, I came to Pyonggang and settled down. If I hadn't seen it recover with my own eyes, how could I have imagined that it was once a ruin? Now, there are five or six hundred families living here. A large-scale state-owned farm has been established, and a tractor station has been built. The lake dam has been repaired, and a middle school has been built. There is a club that can accommodate six or seven hundred people for meetings or theater performances, a library with various newspapers and agricultural reference books, a nursery that cares for dozens of children, and a supply and marketing cooperative that sells various daily necessities. Trains arrive here every day to unload many supplies. All the open spaces have been planted with crops.
    One evening in mid-July, we went to visit the home of Song Tae-seong, the production team leader of the farm, at the appointed time. Along the path, brushing aside the lush soybean leaves and melon vines, we arrived at his door. At this time, he had just returned from work and was eating dinner.
    "Your arrival makes me so happy, I don't know what to say!" He greeted us with a smile and invited us to sit on the kang (heated brick bed). Then he brought out a rice dish like a pie and invited us to eat. We thanked him, asked him to continue eating, and observed his small family beside him. His wife sat next to him, holding a chubby baby in her arms. On the other side sat a girl in her teens, with dark eyes and bangs on her forehead. He quickly finished his meal and introduced us, saying that the baby was born last year and had not yet been named. The girl was an orphan who had lost her parents and was now being raised by him. His eyes flashed with a heavy and resolute light as he spoke of his family. The war had taken the lives of his older brother and sister-in-law and three other relatives, destroying his happy family life and causing him to leave his hometown of Goseong and wander to the rear. After the war, he relied on government assistance to settle here. We knew that every family here had a painful memory. To avoid arousing his sadness, we quickly changed the topic to the farm's production situation. He said:
      "When I came here, my wife and I only carried a quilt roll, and we really didn't believe we could restore production." At this time, he looked at the image of Kim Il-sung on the wall with infinite conviction and respect, saying, "But under the call of Leader Kim Il-sung, we mustered our confidence and worked doubly hard. People's Army soldiers demobilized and returned to participate in construction. Volunteer Army comrades helped us, and the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries sent agricultural machinery. We overcame many difficulties, and now, slowly, slowly, everything is recovering." At this time, a joyful smile appeared on the corner of his mouth. After a moment, he continued, "We participated in the state-owned farm production increase competition organized by the central government. We won first place in rice transplanting. We received the victory banner of the production increase movement issued by the central government. We have labor models like Kim Yoo-gong, who received the honorary medal awarded by the State Ministry of Agriculture. Every laborer on our farm can afford to add many things besides eating with their annual income." Saying this, he smiled and looked around the room. So, we also paid attention to the things in the room. A bookshelf hung on one wall, filled with many agricultural reference books that he read. Leaning against one side of the wall was a large wardrobe, filled with clothes, and on top of the wardrobe was a thick stack of quilts and mattresses. On the front wall, many colored pictures cut from Chinese and Korean pictorials were pasted. Across the room was a kitchen. Several clumps of flowers were planted in the small courtyard outside. Pumpkins, corn, and peppers were planted all around. At this time, the evening breeze brought the smell of manure from the fields, the croaking of frogs, and the music broadcast by the Pyongyang Broadcasting Station from the People's Army barracks. The night was so quiet. Under the dim light, we faced this working family. Thinking of the more beautiful and peaceful life they would build, we deeply felt surrounded by an atmosphere of solemn peace and tranquility. When we said goodbye to the host and returned through the main road, we felt that this atmosphere was emanating from all the farmhouses. It was shrouded in the fields where corn and rice seedlings were growing vigorously.
    Friends! Like all other places in northern Korea, Pyonggang has changed, becoming more and more beautiful. The industrious and simple people here are busy working on the road, in the fields, and in front of their homes, building a happy life. They not only love labor, but also love art. You can hear their songs and see their beautiful dances everywhere. What a peace-loving nation this is!
    Whenever I stroll in the fields in the morning or evening, and think of Pyonggang's past and future, I look to the mountain range that shields it in front. There is the famous Qiu Shaoyun position. There is the hill where the famous sniper Su Xusong used cold shots to eliminate the enemy. There is the highland where first-class meritorious hero Li Guohai single-handedly blew up the enemy's regimental headquarters. Many heroes and martyrs shed their blood to recapture and defend this land from the enemy. And now, soldiers on the top of the mountains! You stand tall there. You are protecting the peaceful life that is flourishing here, protecting the people here, and the peaceful people are paying tribute to you!

    今日平康
    仲册
    朋友们！你们在来信中常常问道：“朝鲜恢复得怎样了？”在这纪念志愿军出国作战六周年的时候，让我向你们作一点报告吧！
    朋友！你到过或听说过平康吗？平康是三八线以北的一个小城镇。现在，它像朝鲜其他被战争毁坏的城镇一样，已经从废墟上站了起来，变得更加美丽了。
    1953年6月中旬，我初次经过平康。那时，它已经遭到战争的严重破坏。我们起初只看见一片杂乱的荒草，等到仔细观看，才在荒草掩盖的下面，发现了城市的痕迹。谁能想到呢？一个美丽的和平城镇，现在几乎土墙也不剩了。野草在瓦砾堆上长弯了腰。炮弹坑连接起来像一片大池塘。破碎的磨石，烧焦的电杆，横躺在街心，歪着身子的邮箱孤零零地站在路旁。我们默默地走着，走在这无人的城镇的废墟上。愤怒的火从心里燃烧起来。对帝国主义侵略者的仇恨和对朝鲜人民的同情，推动着我们加快步伐，迅速地投向战斗的最前线。
    不久之后，停战了。三年以来炮声第一次停止了。我们在阵地上，望着平康，望着平静下来的荒芜的田野，想念它的主人。
    就是那年10月初旬的一天，我和几位同志又经过这儿。我们意外地看见路旁边出来一个阿朱妈尼（朝语大嫂）。她穿着洁净的白衣黑裙，顶着满罐的水。当她发现了我们时，眼睛里就充满了激动，一直注视我们。走近时，看她想说什么，嘴动了一下，擦过我们身子走进一条小路去了。我们顺小路望去，看见那山脚下盖起了一座简单的小草房。草房前一株被炮弹打秃了的树桩上挂着一些篓子和家什。一条老黄牛卧在树下嚼着草料。一个头发都白了的阿伯齐（老大爷）在埋头编着什么东西。“啊！他们回来了。”我们同声地叫起来。我们跑上前去招呼老大爷，抚摸老黄牛，看他们所有带回来的东西。
      “老大爷！你受够了苦了吧！但是，总归是回来了，我们会来帮你的忙的。”我们向老大爷说，但他听不懂。他一面点头，一面比着手势用简单的中国话重复着说：“志愿军东木（同志），你们大大的辛苦了，你们大大的辛苦了。”他好像见到自己的亲人一样，那满是皱纹的脸上，发出兴奋的红光。我们从心里欢呼道：“平康的主人，终于回来了”。我们兴奋和激动了好久。
    不久后，我们听到一消息，说朝鲜政府将八千名老乡送回来了。这消息，振奋了前沿阵地每一个战士的心。当这些老乡陆续地出现在许多居民点的时候，便有许多支帮助朝鲜人民重建家园的队伍从阵地上下来了。他们有的是帮助修住房的，有的是帮助修砖瓦窑的。有的是来修复被炸坏的湖堤，有的是来修建新的学校。他们在荒芜的田野里割草来盖房，他们在二十多里外的高山上砍伐木料。过去，拉运粮弹的汽车和马车队，现在装满了种籽和木料在路上奔跑着。过去拿着枪杆和敌人撕杀的战士们，现在变成了工人，在工地上忙碌着。他们在“要使朝鲜人民早一点安好家”的口号下，把每天八小时的工作延长到十多小时。某部党员李明德同志把脚摔坏了，仍坚持工作。一个朝鲜砖瓦厂的厂长说：“志愿军干活，一个人要顶一个半。”就是这样，他们帮助回来的老乡，在一个冬天里，把许多房屋在废墟上建立起来了。
    冬天过去，第一个和平的春天到了平康，布谷鸟也很早很早的就叫起来了。于是，拖拉机开来了，在那一片黑色草灰覆盖的田野上，翻起了长了三年的草根，翻转了红油浸过似的泥土。一群群穿着白衣的老乡们，在地里插着红旗，填着弹坑，唱着歌，一行行的撒着种籽。我们在阵地上，白天，观看那一片片成长起来的绿色秧苗，看那秧苗地里散布着的、蠕动着的白色点子和绿色点子〔注〕。夜里，我们眺望那村子里像星星般闪烁的灯火，点着它的数目。我们在阵地上吃到了老乡们送来新鲜青菜。我们在被他们邀请的宴席上尝到了新酿的黄酒，和他们一块儿击着碟子，唱起“洛东江边”之歌。
    日子过得很快，每一个白天和夜晚，这儿的田野、村庄，都在改变着战争时的荒芜模样。一切都变了，变得来使你不敢再认识它了。今年春天，我来到平康并住下来。要不是我亲眼看见它恢复起来的话，我怎敢想像它原是一片废墟呢？现在这儿居住了五、六百户人家。成立规模相当大的国营农场，建立了拖拉机站。修好湖堤，修起了中学校。有了可容六、七百人开会或看戏的俱乐部，有了有各种报纸和农业参考书籍的图书馆，有了托管着几十个孩子的托儿所，有了卖各种生活用品的供销合作社。火车每天到这里来卸下许多物资。空地上都种上了庄稼。
    7月中旬的一个傍晚，我们按约定的时刻去访问农场生产队长宋太晟的家。沿着小路，拂开路旁蓬茂的豆叶和瓜蔓，来到他的家门前。这时，他刚下工回来吃着晚饭。
    “你们的来临，使我高兴得不知说什么好！”他满面笑容的迎着我们坐在炕上。接着端出一种馅饼似的饭食请我们吃。我们谢过了他，请他继续吃饭，在旁边观察着他这小家庭。他旁边坐着他的妻子，他妻子怀中抱着一个胖胖的婴孩。另一边坐着一个十多岁的女孩，乌黑的眼睛，头前复着留海。他很快吃完了饭，介绍说，婴孩是去年才生下来的，还没有取名字。女孩是一个失去父母的孤儿，现在由他抚养着。他眼里闪着沉重而坚毅的光辉，谈起了他的家庭。战争夺取了他哥嫂和兄弟三个亲人的生命，破坏了他幸福的家庭生活，使他离弃了家乡高城，流浪到了后方。战后，才依靠政府帮助，来到这儿安家。我们知道，这儿的每一个家庭，都有着一段悲痛的回忆。为了避免他勾起伤心，我们把话题很快谈到农场的生产情况来。他说：
      “来这儿的时候，我和妻子只背着一个被盖卷，我们真不相信能把生产恢复起来”。这时，他带着无限坚信和尊敬的神情，望了望墙上的金日成像说：“可是，在领袖金日成元帅的号召下，我们鼓起了信心，加倍努力地工作。人民军战士复员回来参加了建设。志愿军同志帮助了我们，苏联和其他兄弟国家送来了农业机械。我们克服了许多困难，现在慢慢地、慢慢地、一切都恢复起来了。”这时，他嘴角上浮起欣悦的笑。停了片刻，他又继续说道：“我们参加了中央组织的国营农场增产竞赛运动。获得了插秧第一的优胜。得到了中央颁发的增产运动胜利旗。我们出现了金惟功这样的劳动模范，他受到了国家农业省颁发的荣誉勋章。我们农场的每个劳动力，全年的收入，除了吃以外，还能添置许多东西。”说到这里，他微笑着向屋内环顾了一下。于是，我们也注意的看起这屋内的东西来。一边墙上挂着一个书架，放着许多他所阅读的农业参考书籍。一边靠墙，立着一个大衣橱，橱里装着衣服，橱上放着厚厚的一叠被子和褥子。正面墙上，张贴着许多中国画报和朝鲜画报上剪下的彩色图片。隔房那边，是一间厨房。屋外小地坝里种着几丛花。四周种着南瓜、苞米和辣椒。这时，晚风吹来了田野的粪草气味，送来青蛙的鸣声，和那人民军营房里平壤广播电台广播的音乐声。夜，是这样的安静。我们在微黄的灯光下，面对着这个劳动的家庭。想着他们将要建设得更美好的和平生活，深深地感到被一种庄严的和平和安静的气氛包围着。当我们告别主人，穿过大路返回的时候，感觉到这种气氛正在所有的农家小屋散发出来。笼罩在那茁茁上长着苞谷林和稻秧的田野之上。
    朋友们！像朝鲜北部其它所有的地方一样，平康变了，变得愈来愈美丽了。这儿的勤劳而纯朴的人民，为建设幸福的生活，在路途上、在田野里、在家屋前忙碌地劳动着。他们不只热爱劳动，而且热爱艺术。什么地方你也可以听见他们的歌声，也可以看见他们的优美的舞蹈。这是一个多么热爱和平的民族啊！
    每当我漫步在早晨或黄昏的田野，想起平康的过去和未来的时候，我便要向前面那一带屏障似的山头望去。那儿有著名的丘少云阵地。有著名冷枪手苏许松冷枪歼敌的山头。有一等功臣李国海单身炸毁敌连部的高地。许多英雄和烈士们用鲜血从敌人手中夺回并又保卫了这片地方。而现在，高山头上的战士们啊！你们在那儿挺立着。你们保卫着这儿正在繁荣起来的和平生活，保卫着这儿的人们，和平的人民在向你们致敬！
