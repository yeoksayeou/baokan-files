Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The Romanian News Agency reports that a new oilfield has recently been discovered in the Petresti region of Romania, proving that the region has abundant crude oil reserves. The Petresti Drilling Company has decided to continue drilling work near the new mining area. Experts believe that the discovery of this new oilfield is of great significance for increasing Romania's crude oil production.

Since liberation, Romania's petroleum industry has greatly developed. During the first five-year plan, many new oilfields were discovered, resulting in an increase in the country's crude oil production from 5.3 million tons in 1943 before liberation to 10.575 million tons in 1955.

The second five-year plan, which began in 1956, stipulates that Romania's crude oil production will reach 13.5 million tons by 1960. To achieve this goal, exploration during the second five-year plan will increase by 55%-60% compared with 1955. During the five years, geological and geophysical exploration of new areas will be greatly developed, and exploration work will be improved by using geophysical and radioactive exploration, as well as seismic exploration methods.

    罗马尼亚不断发现新的油田
    1960年原油产量将达到一千三百五十万吨
    新华社20日讯　据罗马尼亚通讯社报道：罗马尼亚的彼特兹迪州最近发现了一处新的油田，从而证明了这个州有大量的原油蕴藏。彼特兹迪钻探公司已经决定在新矿区附近继续进行钻探工作。专家们认为，这一新油田的发现对增加罗马尼亚的原油生产有重要意义。
    解放以后，罗马尼亚的石油工业有很大发展。第一个五年计划期间曾经发现了许多新的油田，结果使全国的原油产量由解放前1943年的五百三十万吨增加到1955年的一千零五十七万五千吨。
    从1956年开始的第二个五年计划规定，到1960年罗马尼亚的原油产量将达到一千三百五十万吨。为达到这一目标，第二个五年计划期间的勘探量将比1955年增加55％—60％。五年中将大大发展对新地区的地质和地球物理勘探，并且将通过采用地球物理和放射勘探，以及地震勘探法来改进勘探工作。
