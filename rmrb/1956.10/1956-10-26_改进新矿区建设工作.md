Improve the Construction Work of New Mining Areas

Xu Daben, Vice Minister of Coal Industry

In order to meet the coal needs of new iron and steel industrial bases and new industrial cities, the coal industry must develop new mining areas in inland areas where resource conditions are available. During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the larger new mining areas we started to build include Shiguai in Inner Mongolia, Fenxi and Luan in Shanxi, Pingdingshan and Hebi in Henan, Tongchuan in Shaanxi, and Zhongliangshan in Sichuan. These new mining areas are all located in remote areas far from cities and with inconvenient transportation. Each new mining area, once completed, will have an annual coal production capacity of several million to ten million tons. Due to the rapid development of industry, the construction of new mining areas is very urgent in terms of time, and the workload of annually building mines, concentrators, and auxiliary factories is very large. Over the past few years, under the leadership of the Party and government, all employees have overcome many difficulties and achieved certain results.

However, due to our lack of experience, insufficient estimation of the difficulties that may occur in the construction of new mining areas, and insufficient understanding of the importance of preparatory work before construction and employee living welfare facilities, almost all new mining areas are now starting construction without railways and power supplies, and insufficient employee housing preparation. Moreover, after the start of construction, this situation has not been improved as it should be, and there are still many difficulties in the construction of new mining areas.

To build new mining areas, a large amount of equipment and materials must be transported to the construction site. In 1955 and 1956, the total transportation volume in the construction of new mining areas was over 30 million ton-kilometers. Because there are no railways or roads, these equipment and materials have to rely on manual and animal power for transportation. The transportation distance is long, some as far as seventy kilometers, the freight is high, the transportation capacity is small, and large equipment simply cannot be transported to the site. As a result, work stoppages waiting for materials and equipment often occur. Due to the above reasons, construction costs in the Hebi, Pingdingshan, and Shandan mining areas in 1955 exceeded by about 30%; in the Luan mining area, due to the lack of railways, the mines and coal preparation plants designed abroad cannot be constructed, and the coking coal supply for the Wuhan Iron and Steel Base will not be guaranteed on schedule. In June of this year, a water inrush accident occurred in the Hebi mining area. Because there was no railway, the drainage equipment collected from various places could not be quickly transported to the site after arriving in Tangyin (only twenty-three kilometers away from Hebi), which affected the timeliness of the accident rescue.

In addition to many ground constructions, new mining areas also have heavy underground operations such as well sinking and roadway development. The projects of drilling, blasting, rock grabbing, rock loading, hoisting, drainage, and ventilation must be constructed by machinery, and the primary condition to guarantee the machinery operation is sufficient power supply. Due to the small capacity of temporary power generation equipment and the failure to construct permanent power stations in a timely manner, the rapidly developing needs of basic construction cannot be met. Many new mining areas lack power and cannot guarantee normal construction. Pingdingshan has frequently experienced work stoppages in the No. 2 and No. 3 wells due to insufficient power. If the permanent power plant cannot supply power in the first quarter of next year, it will affect the continued construction of the projects already started and the start of construction of new mines.

In the construction of new districts, employee housing and some welfare facilities for serving employees are also important issues. At present, there are nearly 30,000 construction workers in the new districts, and most of them have not solved the problem of family housing, and have been living apart from their families for a long time. At the same time, medical institutions are not sound, it is difficult to seek medical treatment, schools are insufficient, and children cannot go to school; due to inconvenient transportation, the supply of daily necessities is insufficient, and prices are higher than in general areas. This situation seriously affects the enthusiasm of employees for life and work.

If these problems cannot be properly resolved, they will inevitably seriously affect the smooth progress of the construction of new mining areas, and it will be difficult to guarantee the coal supply for the new industrial bases. Therefore, I believe that for the new mining areas currently under construction, railway branch lines and roads should be built quickly, which is not only necessary, but also economically reasonable; permanent power stations and transmission lines should be constructed in a planned manner according to the needs of construction development; and active measures should be taken to gradually solve employee housing and improve other necessary living welfare facilities.

In the future, before the construction of a new mining area begins:

First, railways should be built in advance. If some new mining areas must be constructed before the railway is completed, roads should also be built in advance, and the necessary vehicles should be supplied to the site;

Second, temporary power stations sufficient to ensure construction should be built in advance, and preparations for permanent power stations and transmission lines should be actively carried out, so that the construction of permanent power stations and transmission lines can begin at the same time as the construction of the new mining area;

Third, according to the scale of construction, an appropriate number of employee housing and necessary living welfare facilities—medical institutions, bathhouses, schools, shops, etc.—should be built before construction; the investment issues of urban construction undertakings serving employees and the division of labor between various departments also need to be clearly resolved.

In order to do a good job in the preparation work before the construction of new mining areas, I believe that the primary issue is that when the state formulates plans, it should conduct careful balance and comprehensive arrangements for various construction undertakings in terms of construction scale, construction time, and investment based on the requirements of new mining area construction.

The construction of new mining areas is a very heavy and complex task. The issues of worker-peasant relations, the supply of daily necessities for employees, and urban construction must rely on the leadership and close cooperation of local Party and government. Therefore, the timely establishment of Party and government organizations in mining areas to strengthen the leadership of various aspects of work is also a very important matter.

The construction of new mining areas is completely new work for us. We lack experience, and there are still many shortcomings and errors in our work, especially low project quality, many accidents, and serious waste. However, we have the confidence to continuously correct errors, overcome shortcomings, and improve the construction work of the coal industry under the leadership of the Party.

### 改进新矿区建设工作

    改进新矿区建设工作
    煤炭工业部副部长　徐达本
    为了满足新的钢铁工业基地和新的工业城市的煤炭需要，煤炭工业必须在内地资源条件具备的地方开发新矿区。第一个五年计划期内我们开工建设的比较大的新矿区有内蒙古的石拐子，山西的汾西、潞安，河南的平顶山、鹤壁，陕西的铜川，四川的中梁山等。这些新矿区都是处在远离城市、交通不便的偏僻地区。每个新矿区在建成后，年产煤能力都在数百万到一千万吨左右。由于工业的发展很快，要求新矿区的建设在时间上是非常紧迫的，逐年建设的矿井、选矿厂和附属工厂的工作量都是很大的。几年来，全体职工在党政的领导下，克服了许多困难，也取得了一定的成绩。
    但是，由于我们缺乏经验，对新矿区建设中可能发生的困难估计不足，对施工前的准备工作和职工生活福利设施的重要性认识不够，现在所有的新矿区，几乎都是在没有铁路和电源、职工住宅准备不足的情况下就开工了，而且在开工后，这种情况也没有得到应有的改善，新矿区建设中的困难还是很多的。
    建设新的矿区，必须要把大量的设备和材料运到施工现场。1955年和1956年新矿区建设中的总运输量在三千万吨公里以上。因为没有铁路和公路，这些设备和材料，不得不依靠人力和畜力运输。运输距离长，有的远达七十公里，运费高，运输能力小，而且大型设备则根本无法运到现场。因之，常常发生停工待料和等设备的现象。由于上述原因，1955年鹤壁、平顶山、山丹等矿区施工费用超支30％左右；潞安矿区由于没有铁路，国外设计的矿井和选煤厂，都无法进行施工，武汉钢铁基地的炼焦煤将不能按期保证供应。鹤壁矿区，今年6月间发生了透水事故，由于没有铁路，从各处调集的排水设备运到汤阴后（离鹤壁仅二十三公里），不能迅速运到现场，影响了抢救事故的时效。
    新矿区除了有很多地面建设以外，还有凿井和巷道开拓等很繁重的地下作业，其中打眼、爆破、抓岩、装岩、提升、排水、通风等工程，都必须使用机械进行施工，而保证机械层转的首要条件，就是要有足够的电力供应。由于临时发电设备容量小，而且也没有及时地建设永久发电站，因而，不能满足基本建设迅速发展的需要，许多新矿区电力不足，无法保证正常施工。平顶山曾因电力不足，二、三号井经常发生停工现象。如果明年第一季永久发电厂不能供电，将要影响已开工的工程继续施工和新矿井的开工。
    在新区建设中，职工住宅和为职工服务的一些福利设施，同样也是一个重要问题。目前新区有将近三万的建设职工，绝大部分没有解决家属住宅，长期地与家属过着两地生活。同时医疗机构不健全，治病困难，学校不足，子弟上不了学；由于交通不便，生活必需品供应不足，价格比一般地区高。这种情况，严重地影响着职工的生活和工作的积极性。
    以上这些问题，如果不能妥善解决，必然严重影响新矿区建设工作地顺利进行，并难以保证新工业基地的煤炭供应。因此我认为：对目前正在进行建设的新矿区，应该迅速修建铁路支线和公路，这不仅是必需的，而且在经济上也是合理的；应该根据建设发展的需要，有计划地建设永久发电站和输电线路；并采取积极措施，逐步地解决职工住宅和改进其他必要的生活福利设施。
    在今后，新矿区开始建设前应该：
    第一、事先修建铁路。如有的新矿区必须在铁路建成前施工时，也应事先修建公路，并供给现场必需的汽车；
    第二、事先建设足以保证施工的临时发电站，并积极做好永久电站和输电线路的准备工作，以便在新矿区开始建设的同时，就能开始永久电站和输电线路的建设；
    第三、根据建设的规模，在施工前，先修建适当数量的职工住宅以及必要的生活福利设施——医疗机构、澡堂、学校、商店等；对于为职工服务的城市建设事业的投资问题和各部门之间的分工问题，也需要明确加以解决。
    为了做好新矿区建设前的各项准备工作，我认为首要的问题是国家制定计划时，根据新矿区建设的要求，对各项建设事业，在建设规模、建设时间、投资等方面，进行周密的平衡和全面地安排。
    新矿区的建设，是一项很繁重、很复杂的工作。关于工农关系问题，关于职工生活必需品的供应问题，关于城市建设问题，都必须依靠地方党和政府的领导和密切配合。因此，及时地建立矿区党和政府的机构，以加强对各方面工作的领导，也是一项很重要的事情。
    新矿区的建设，对于我们完全是新的工作，我们缺乏经验，工作上还有很多的缺点和错误，特别是工程质量低，事故多，浪费严重，但是，我们有信心在党的领导下，不断地纠正错误，克服缺点，改进煤炭工业的建设工作。
