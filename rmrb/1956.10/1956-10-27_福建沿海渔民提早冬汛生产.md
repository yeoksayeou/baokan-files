Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 25th - Fishermen in various parts of Fujian Province have recently started their winter fishing season earlier than usual. Fishermen in Dongshan County went to sea a month earlier than last year's winter fishing season and achieved bumper harvests for several consecutive days in late September. The Chengguan Qiaoqi Fishery Cooperative in this county caught more than 624,000 jin of yellow croaker in the first five days of the winter fishing season, completing one-third of its entire winter fishing production plan. Preliminary statistics show that the number of fishing boats already and about to be put into winter fishing production throughout the province has increased by more than 1,200 compared to last year's winter fishing season.
