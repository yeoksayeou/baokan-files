    The Powell Case Is a New Attack on the American People
    Louis Alley, Chairman of the "Committee to Support the Editors of the 'China Weekly Review' J.W. Powell”
    On October 11, 1956, supporters and old friends of the "China Weekly Review" established the "Committee to Support the Editors of the 'China Weekly Review' J.W. Powell" in Beijing. The purpose of this organization is to provide all possible support to J.W. Powell and his wife Sylvia, and their assistant Julian Schuman. The three of them are currently being tried in American criminal courts because they dared to truthfully report what they saw and heard to the American people.
    Thirty-five years ago, J.W. Powell's father, the elder Powell, founded the "China Weekly Review" in Shanghai. Later, the weekly was changed to a monthly publication, and it continued to be published after Liberation. By 1953, the U.S. government's ban on sending the publication to the United States caused many economic difficulties. This was a publication dedicated to reporting on the situation in China, and the vast majority of its subscribers were in the United States. It was also a privately-run newspaper, and after suffering such a large economic loss, it could not continue to operate. The Powell couple and Julian Schuman stopped publishing the newspaper not long after participating in the great Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing. They returned to the United States the following year.
    As soon as they arrived in Hong Kong, they were persecuted. American agents intimidated them and coerced them into participating in American espionage work. Upon landing in the United States, their books, newspapers, and many personal belongings were confiscated. Although Sylvia managed to find a job, she was immediately fired after she and her husband were subpoenaed by Congress. Powell had to peddle school supplies to earn commissions. The only job Sylvia found after being fired was typing for someone thirty miles from home, requiring her to take a bus there every day, which caused a lot of suffering for their two children.
    Nevertheless, the Powell couple often spoke at public gatherings, striving to tell the people the truth about what they had seen in China. Julian Schuman wrote a book describing his experiences in China, which is now being prepared for publication. After several congressional subpoenas, the situation has developed into a criminal case, and the court is constantly subpoenaing them. It is only with the help of friends that they have been able to raise bail money.
    People around the world are puzzled as to why the United States is making such a fuss about this matter at this particular time. The time from 1953 to 1956 is not short. If their "crimes" were so serious, why didn't they deal with them earlier?
    The United States prohibits its own journalists from coming to China to see the current situation with their own eyes, and it is persecuting those who report the truth to the American people. These two things actually provide a clue as to why the American authorities are taking so many unusual actions at this time. In this case, it is effectively announcing to American journalists: "If you report the truth about China, you can expect to spend the rest of your life in prison." However, the world today is not the same as yesterday. Within the United States, more and more people are raising questions; we can honestly say that it is the American ruling group that is on trial, not the Powell couple and Julian Schuman.
    The indictment accuses Powell of thirteen counts. It brings up the entire issue of germ warfare again. The defense lawyers have already requested that witnesses from all sides appear in court to testify. China has already agreed to provide fifty witnesses, including Li Dequan, Chairman of the Chinese Investigation Team on American Imperialist Germ Warfare Crimes and President of the Chinese Red Cross, and Liao Chengzhi, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese Investigation Team on American Imperialist Germ Warfare Crimes. In fact, the number of people who can testify is many times greater than this list that has already been telegraphed to the defense lawyers.
    The U.S. government carried out large-scale germ warfare in a cruel manner, which of course it is very clear about. However, it has great faith in the machine it has in hand to intimidate the people and to rape the will of witnesses--the recent book written by Matusow has already exposed this to readers, therefore it dares to put the germ warfare issue in the charges of the indictment against Powell, et al. Another charge in the indictment is that the Powell couple said that the Kuomintang was corrupt. This will make people in China laugh out loud. However, it also shows how people in the United States are being deceived and how they still lack understanding of the situation in China, so it is possible to openly use this as a charge. The U.S. government knows better than anyone how the Kuomintang plundered the Chinese people, how it was rejected, and how it caused the despair of the people. Stilwell and others made detailed reports on these situations. Regarding the germ warfare issue, any honest person who has seen the evidence of germ warfare cannot but believe it to be true. The chairman of the International Scientific Commission that investigated the facts of germ warfare in 1952 said that if the conclusions carefully made by the investigation commission were still untrue, then it could only be assumed that thousands upon thousands of strangers, far apart from each other, were telling the same lies, and understood the full set of stories that each had compiled.
    The Powell case is a deliberately planned political conspiracy, with the goal of intimidating people who oppose official U.S. policy. The people behind the scenes in this case also want to use it as a weapon to delay the acceptance of China into the United Nations, and to divert the attention of the American people during the current presidential election from major domestic issues.
    The American people are a great people, with a tradition of long-term struggle, and they love freedom. Among the members of the support committee established in China across the ocean today, there are five Americans. One of them is a member of the New York Bar Association, and another is the vice chairman of the committee, and she is a former national committee worker of the American Young Women's Christian Association. The Powell family is a typical American family. Powell's father, the elder Powell, was a well-known American journalist, and his firm stance in the events that led to the Pacific War was highly respected. At that time, he was arrested by the Japanese Imperial Army for writing articles exposing the Japanese army's behavior in Shanghai, and he suffered all kinds of torture in prison, resulting in the loss of both legs. But now, if this case is sentenced according to the thirteen counts, the main defendants may be sentenced to a total of 260 years in prison and a fine of $130,000.
    Who are the people behind this strange accusation case? You don't have to look very far to find them. It is the "China Lobby" that is doing it. This is a political group supported by the Kuomintang, and it has a great influence in American political life. It has gold plundered from China for squandering. It has plenty of money, and it spends its money extravagantly where it thinks it will be most effective. The "China Weekly Review" never had a lot of money. But it bravely reported the use of methods of mass destruction in Korea, reported the barbarity of sadists, and reported the devastation that the war caused to the Korean people. These reports touched more hearts than the sordid American dollars of the "China Lobby" could buy with tongues and ears. It is a force for peace, and its expression of the sober views of Americans will be increasingly praised by peace-loving people around the world.
    In May 1955, Soong Ching Ling wrote a letter to the American "Nation" magazine about the Powell case. Here, I think it is best to quote a passage from this letter:
    "Are we to believe that the United States government believes that the only patriotic Americans are those whose concern for our country is limited to pursuing war and subverting the system that we established after a century of struggle and that we find very suitable for us in practice? If so, then the situation in the United States is extremely harmful to world peace. As for myself—and I know that most of my compatriots are the same—I do not believe that rational and freedom-loving Americans hold such views."
    It takes money to fight for such a case. The "Committee to Support the Editors of the 'China Weekly Review' J.W. Powell" will try to raise funds. The Powell family and Julian Schuman are in very difficult circumstances, and their defense requires a lot of legal and other expenses. There is only one way to solve this problem, and that is to appeal to the people everywhere who support them.

    鲍惠尔案是对美国人民新的进攻
    “声援‘密勒氏评论报’编辑鲍惠尔委员会”主席　路易·艾黎
    1956年10月11日，“密勒氏评论报”的支持者和老朋友们在北京成立了“声援‘密勒氏评论报’编辑鲍惠尔委员会”。这个组织的目的，是要尽一切可能支援约·威·鲍惠尔和他的妻子锡尔维亚与他们的助理朱立安·舒曼。他们三人现在正受到美国刑事法庭的审讯，原因是他们敢于将自己所见所闻的东西向美国人民据实报道。
    三十五年前，约·威·鲍惠尔的父亲老鲍惠尔在上海创办了“密勒氏评论报”周刊。后来该报改为月刊，解放以后仍然出版，到1953年，由于美国政府禁止该报寄往美国，使该报在经济上遇到很多困难。这是一个专门报道中国情况的刊物，它的订户绝大部分都在美国，它又是一家私人办的报刊，在经济上蒙受了这样大的损失后就无法继续办下去。鲍惠尔夫妇和朱立安·舒曼在北京参加了伟大的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议以后，不久就把该报停刊了。他们在第二年就回到了美国。
    他们一到香港，就受到了迫害。美国的特务们向他们进行恫吓，并且胁迫他们参加美国的间谍工作。在美国登岸的时候，随身携带的书籍、报刊以及许多个人的东西都被没收了。锡尔维亚虽然设法找到了工作，可是在她和她的丈夫被国会传讯以后，她就马上被解雇了。鲍惠尔只得代人到处兜售学校用品，挣点佣金。锡尔维亚在解雇后找到的唯一工作，是在一个离家三十英里的地方代人打字，每天都得乘公共汽车上那里去，这就使他们的两个孩子受了很多的苦。
    尽管如此，鲍惠尔夫妇还是经常在公众集会上演讲，竭力把自己在中国所看到的实况告诉人民。朱立安·舒曼写了一本书叙述自己在中国的经历，现在正在着手出版。经国会几次传讯他们之后，现在发展成为刑事案件，法庭也接连的在传讯他们，全仗朋友们的帮助才筹集了保释金。
    世界各地的人民都感到很奇怪，觉得美国为什么偏偏在这个时候在这件事情上如此小题大做呢？从1953年到1956年，时间不可谓不长。若说他们真是“罪行”如此重大，为什么早不来处理呢？
    美国禁止自己的新闻记者来华亲眼看一看中国的现状，并且大举迫害那些向美国人民报道事实真象的人。这两件事情实际上提供了一个线索，说明美国当权人物为什么要在这个时候采取许多异乎寻常的行动。就此案来说，事实上等于是向美国新闻记者们宣告：“你报道中国的真象，就请你坐一辈子的牢。”但是，今天的世界已经不像昨天了。在美国国内，也有愈来愈多的人在发出疑问；我们可以老实说，这次在受审讯的正是美国的统治集团，而不是鲍惠尔夫妇和朱立安·舒曼。
    起诉书控告鲍惠尔有十三条罪状。它把整个细菌战问题又重新提起来了。被告律师已经发出请求，要各方面的证人出庭作证。中国已经有五十位证人答应作证，其中包括美帝国主义细菌战罪行的中国调查团主席、中国红十字会会长李德全，美帝国主义细菌战罪行的中国调查团副主席廖承志。实际上，可以作证的人数，比已经电告被告律师的这个名单要多上好些倍。
    美国政府残酷地进行过大规模的细菌战，这当然是它自己非常清楚的事情。可是它非常相信自己手中那套恫吓人民和强奸证人意志的机器——马图索最近写的那本书已经向读者们揭露了这点，因此它才敢于在控诉鲍惠尔等的罪状里，把细菌战问题也提了出来。起诉书里的另一条罪状，是鲍惠尔夫妇说过国民党是腐败的。这使在中国的人听了一定要哄然大笑。可是，这也说明在美国人们是怎样受着蒙蔽，他们对于中国的情况仍然缺乏了解，因此才可能把这条也公开当作罪状来进行控诉。关于国民党如何搜刮中国人民，如何遭到唾弃，如何造成人民的绝望，美国政府比任何人都知道得清楚些。史迪威和其他一些人，都就这些情况做过详细的报告。谈到细菌战问题，任何看过细菌战证据的正直人士都不能不信为事实。1952年调查细菌战事实的国际科学委员会主席说过，要是经调查委员会审慎做出的结论还是不真实的话，那么只有设想彼此相距很远的成千上万的陌生人，都在说一样的谎话，而且了解各自编制的全套故事。
    鲍惠尔案件是一个蓄意策划出来的政治阴谋，目的是要恫吓反对美国官方政策的人们。这个案件的幕后人物，还想把它当作武器来拖延接受中国进入联合国，来转移目前总统竞选期间美国人民对于国内重大问题的注意力。
    美国人民是伟大的人民，他们具有长期斗争的传统，他们热爱自由。在大洋这边的中国今天成立的声援委员会里就有五位委员是美国人。其中一位是美国纽约律师公会的会员，另一位是委员会的副主席，她是前美国女青年会全国委员会的干事。鲍惠尔的家庭是个典型的美国家庭。鲍惠尔的父亲老鲍惠尔是位著名的美国新闻界人士，他在引起太平洋战争的那些事件里所采取的坚定立场，受到人们高度的尊敬。当时由于他撰文揭发了日军在上海的行为，被日本皇军逮捕了起来，在监牢里受尽折磨，以致失去了两条腿。可是现在这个案件如果根据十三条罪状判处的话，主要被告人可能总共要处二百六十年的徒刑和十三万美元的罚款。
    这个奇特的控诉案件，是些什么人在幕后搞的呢？用不着到很远的地方去找。它是“院外援华集团”搞的。这是个国民党支持的政治集团，在美国政治生活中有着很大的影响，它有从中国劫掠来的黄金供挥霍。它有的是钱，它在自己认为最起作用的地方来大花而特花其钱。“密勒氏评论报”从来没有很多的钱。可是它勇敢地报道了在朝鲜使用大规模毁灭性作战方法的情形，报道了虐待狂的野蛮行为，报道了战争给朝鲜人民造成家破人亡的情况。这些报道所打动的心灵比“院外援华集团”龌龊的美金所能收买的喉舌耳目要多得多。它是一支争取和平的力量，它所表达的美国人的清醒的看法，将日益受到全世界爱好和平人民的赞扬。
    1955年5月间，宋庆龄就鲍惠尔案件给美国“民族”周刊写过一封信。在此，我想顶好是引用这封信里的一段话：
    “是否要我们认为，美国政府认为唯一爱国的美国人是那些对我国的关心仅限于追求战争和颠复我们在斗争了一个世纪之后才建立起来的、而且我们在实践中发觉非常适合我们的制度的美国人？如果是这样，那末美国的情况就是一个对世界和平极其有害的情况。就我本人而言——我知道我国大多数同胞也是这样——我不相信，有理性的和爱好自由的美国人也是持有这种见解的。”
    为这样一个案件而斗争是需要钱的。“声援‘密勒氏评论报’编辑鲍惠尔委员会”将设法募款。鲍惠尔家庭和朱立安·舒曼的处境非常困难，而他们的
  申辩又需要很多关于法律方面及其他的费用。现在只有一个办法来解决这个问题，这就是向支持他们的各地人民呼吁。
