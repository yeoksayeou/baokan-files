    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 22nd. The specifications of automobile tires made in China can now basically meet domestic needs. This situation was pointed out in the report materials of the Rubber Industry Experiment and Research Plan Conference held by the Ministry of Chemical Industry in Tianjin.
    The report materials pointed out that all the rubber accessories on the "Liberation" brand trucks made in China are produced in China.
    The report also said that China's rubber industry is currently researching and trial-producing 18 new products such as tractor tires and motorcycle tires. Among these new products are tubeless tires, which signify the future development direction of tires, as well as large 1700-32 automobile tires with a diameter taller than an average adult.
    Another characteristic marking the improvement of China's rubber industry's technical level is the development of directly using domestically produced concentrated natural rubber latex to manufacture rubber products. As of the end of September this year, China's rubber industry has already used natural rubber latex to trial-produce products such as sounding balloons, medical gloves, and battery microporous separators.
    With the continuous development of the rubber industry, a new batch of technical personnel has grown up. The Rubber Industry Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, located in Tianjin, has grown from six people when it started working in 1953 to more than 300 people. The institute plans to carry out 51 scientific research projects this year, and it is expected that 44 of them will be completed by the end of the year.

    我国橡胶工业技术水平提高很快
    自制汽车轮胎规格基本上满足国内需要
    新华社天津22日电　我国自制的汽车轮胎的规格已经基本上可以满足国内的需要。这一情况是化学工业部正在天津举行的橡胶工业试验研究计划会议上的报告材料指出的。
    报告材料指出，我国制造的
  “解放”牌载重汽车上的全套橡胶配件，都是我国自己生产的。
    报告还说，我国橡胶工业现在正在研究和试制的还有拖拉机轮胎、摩托车轮胎等十八种新产品。在这些新产品中有标志着今后轮胎发展方向的无内胎轮胎，还有直径比普通成人还高的一千七百——三十二大型汽车轮胎。
    标志着我国橡胶工业技术水平提高的另一特点，是直接利用国产的浓缩天然胶乳制造橡胶产品的发展。到今年9月底止，我国橡胶工业已经利用天然胶乳试制成了探空气球、医疗用手套、电池微孔隔板等产品。
    随着橡胶工业的不断发展，一批新的技术力量已经成长起来。设在天津的化学工业部橡胶工业科学研究所，已由1953年开始工作时的六个人发展到三百多人。这个所今年计划进行的五十一个科学研究项目，预计到年底可以完成四十四项。
