Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 4th: Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy said in Lahore on October 3rd that he will implement a foreign policy that conforms to the greatest interests of the country.

Suhrawardy said that Pakistan does not allow itself to be dictated to by anyone. He added: If a certain policy reduces Pakistan's prestige, he will definitely abandon that policy.

He said that Pakistan cannot yet be independent without foreign aid. He also said that this situation makes him very painful. He expressed his gratitude to some countries for giving Pakistan assistance, and said: "It is morally or logically wrong to accept assistance and then kick them away." However, he said that he would never sell the country's freedom, and if he had to obtain anything at the cost of freedom, he would definitely refuse it. Suhrawardy arrived in Lahore from Peshawar on October 3rd. He delivered this speech at a welcome meeting held for him by the citizens of Lahore.

When talking about the issue of general elections in the country, he said that it is impossible to hold general elections in February or March 1957 because the time is too short. He believes that political stability is impossible before the general election is held.

He also talked about the relationship between East and West Pakistan. He said that it is important for people to visit each other and exchange views in order to understand each other's problems.

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 4th: The Chairman of the Pakistan People's League, Maulana Bhashani, criticized Pakistan's pro-American policy at a mass rally in Dhaka on October 1st. He said that this policy is causing Pakistan to gradually lose the friendship of Muslim countries.

Bhashani said that following the United States will never bring salvation to Pakistan.

He criticized the government for importing rice from the United States at shockingly high prices, while importing rice from a neighboring country, such as Burma, would be cheaper than from the United States.

    将执行符合国家最大利益的外交政策
    人民联盟主席批评政府追随美国的政策
    新华社喀喇蚩4日电　巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底10月3日在拉合尔说，他将执行一种符合国家最大利益的外交政策。
    苏拉瓦底说，巴基斯坦并没有让自己受任何人支配。他又说：如果某一种政策降低了巴基斯坦的威信，他一定抛弃这种政策。
    他说，巴基斯坦在目前还不能没有外援而自主。他并且表示，这种情况使他很痛苦。他对有些国家给巴基斯坦以援助表示感谢，并且说：“接受援助而又把他们一脚踢开，在道德上说或是在论理上说都是不正当的”。但是，他说，他决不会出卖国家的自由，如果要以自由为代价来取得任何东西，他一定断然拒绝。苏拉瓦底在10月3日从白沙瓦到达拉合尔。在拉合尔市民为他举行的一次欢迎会上，他发表了这个演说。
    在谈到国内普选问题的时候，他说，在1957年2月或者3月的时候还不可能举行普选，因为时间太匆促。他认为，在普选举行之前，政治稳定是不可能的。
    他还谈到关于东西巴基斯坦的关系问题。他说，为了了解彼此的问题，人们互相往来和交换意见是很重要的。
    新华社喀喇蚩4日电　巴基斯坦人民联盟主席大毛拉巴沙尼10月1日在达卡的一次群众大会上批评巴基斯坦的亲美政策。他说，这种政策使得巴基斯坦正在逐渐失去穆斯林国家的友谊。
    巴沙尼说，追随美国永远不会使巴基斯坦获得解救。
    他批评政府以高得惊人的价格从美国进口大米，而从一个邻国，例如从缅甸进口大米，价格要比美国的便宜。
