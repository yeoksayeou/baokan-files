    Kunming Dispatch: Since April of this year, Yunnan Province has experienced a monthly backlog of transported materials. By the end of September, the amount stockpiled outside the province had reached 15,000 tons, while more than 30,000 tons were stockpiled within the province. To solve this problem, the relevant departments, after research, decided to take the following measures. First, the automobiles belonging to each special district commissioner's office should be centrally and uniformly dispatched to be responsible for transportation on the main lines. Short-distance transportation within the special district would be undertaken by local carts and pack cattle. Second, in addition to completing their own transportation tasks, the automobiles used by various government offices should actively assist specialized automobile transportation with their surplus capacity. Third, "empty vehicle dispatch stations" should be set up in areas with relatively concentrated vehicles and materials to reduce empty runs. Empty vehicles passing by should, without hindering their own tasks, be loaded with materials before leaving. Fourth, workers should be mobilized to improve loading and unloading efficiency and appropriately increase driving speed. At the same time, where possible, a two-shift system should be tried to drive around the clock, making full use of the capacity of the automobiles. Recently, the western suburbs of Kunming have used empty vehicles to transport nearly 4,000 tons of stockpiled materials.

    云南省采取四项办法
    解决运输物资积压问题
    本报昆明电　从今年4月份以来，云南省运输物资月月都有积压。到9月底止积压在省外的已达一万五千吨，在省内也积压了三万多吨。为了解决这一问题，各有关部门经过研究，决定采取下列几个办法。第一，把各专署所属的汽车集中统一调度，负责各干线的运输，专区内短距离的运输就由当地马车、驮牛来担承。第二，各机关自用的汽车除完成自己的运输任务外，多余的力量要积极协助专营汽车运输。第三，在车辆、物资比较集中的地方设立“空车现场调度站”，减少汽车放空。路过的放空汽车，在不妨碍完成他自己任务的情况下，一律装上物资再走。第四，发动工人群众提高装卸效率、适当的加快开车速度。同时还在可能的条件下，尽量试行两班制，日夜轮班开车，充分发挥汽车的能力。近来，昆明西郊利用放空汽车已经运走了近四千吨的积压物资。
