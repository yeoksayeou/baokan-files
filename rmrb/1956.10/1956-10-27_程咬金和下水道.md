    Cheng Yaojin and the Sewer

    During a graduation exam at an engineering school, a student majoring in sewers successfully answered the question on his exam slip. When it came time for grading, the chief examiner posed another question: "Tell me, when did Cheng Yaojin live?" "Cheng Yaojin? He was..." The student blushed, unable to answer. He racked his brains, all the professional courses he had learned over the past three years flashing through his mind. But there was no sign of Cheng Yaojin anywhere. Ah, now he had it. Five years ago, he had read a novel called "Tales of the Tang Dynasty" which mentioned Cheng Yaojin, so he quickly blurted out the answer: "Cheng Yaojin, he was a founding meritorious official of the Tang Dynasty."

    But after saying it, he regretted it, certain that he must have misheard. This was a sewer specialty exam, after all, so how could Cheng Yaojin from the Tang Dynasty come up? His heart thumped wildly.

    Unexpectedly, the chief examiner nodded at him, squinting as he wrote a "5" on the score sheet, and said with satisfaction: "You answered correctly. Although we are in the technical field, we shouldn't be ignorant of this kind of common knowledge..."

    程咬金和下水道
    有一个工程学校在举行毕业考试时，下水道专业某学生顺利地回答了考签上的问题。到了评分的时候，主考签师又提出了一个问题：“你说说，程咬金是啥时候的人？”“程咬金？他是……”这位学生脸红了，说不出来。他急忙搜索枯肠，三年来所学的专业课程都浮现在脑际。可是哪里有程咬金的影子呢？啊，有了。五年前读过的一本叫做“说唐”的小说上面说到过程咬金，于是急忙脱口而出答道：“程咬金，他是唐代开国的功臣。”
    可是说过了倒懊悔起来，一定是自己听错了。现在是考下水道专业课呀，怎么会出来唐代的程咬金呢？他心里扑通扑通直跳。
    不料主考教师倒对他点起头来，一面眯着眼在分数单上写了个“5”字，一面满意地对他说：你答得对，咱们虽是干技术的，这些普通常识可不应当不知道……”
