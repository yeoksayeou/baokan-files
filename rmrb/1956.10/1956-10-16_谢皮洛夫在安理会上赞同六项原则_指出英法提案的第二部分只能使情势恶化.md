Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 15th: According to TASS, Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov spoke at the Security Council meeting on October 13th. He explained the Soviet Union's attitude towards the new Anglo-French proposal and emphasized that the method of consultation is the only correct way to resolve the Suez issue.

    Shepilov said: When the Security Council meeting began its work, the situation was very disturbing. At that time, the various difficulties and obstacles that were obstructing the correct resolution of the Suez issue had not been cleared away, and this path had been artificially blocked. These difficulties and obstacles have not yet been removed. But after all, there is a trend towards improvement of the situation. The initial experience of applying the method of consultation to the complex Suez issue not only proves that this method is feasible, but also gives all of us reason to hope that we can reach a mutually agreeable and fair solution.

    Shepilov said that the situation in the past few days has shown that the convening of the Security Council meeting has made it possible for the representatives of the United Kingdom and France to establish contact with the representatives of Egypt on the Suez issue. This is undoubtedly a positive fact, which should be attributed to the United Nations. Thanks to the exchange of views between the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom and France and the Foreign Minister of Egypt with the active and effective participation of the United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, the two sides were able to reach some generally agreed principles through consultation, and concrete measures and corresponding methods for a peaceful resolution of the Suez issue should be formulated in the future based on these principles.

    Shepilov then spoke about the new Anglo-French proposal, saying: The first part of the new Anglo-French proposal, that is, the part that includes these principles, will inevitably receive unanimous endorsement from the Security Council. He said that it would be too simplistic to say that the difficulties in reaching an agreement have now been overcome. It seems that there will still be many difficulties, but the first part of the proposal has laid a good foundation. It is a matter of the United Nations' honor to consolidate the initial achievements and ensure that the negotiations continue to develop fruitfully.

    The Soviet Union believes that the preliminary negotiations have provided an important prerequisite for seeking a mutually agreeable solution to the Suez issue.

    Shepilov said that during the Security Council meeting, it was clear that Egypt agreed to: First, establish a cooperative system between the Egyptian authorities managing the Suez Canal and the users of the canal, taking into account both Egypt's sovereignty and rights and the interests of the users of the canal. Second, Egypt agreed to establish a system for collecting tolls and fees, ensuring equal treatment for canal users without any discrimination. Third, Egypt agreed to allocate a reasonable proportion of the canal's revenue to improve the canal. In addition, some other important clauses were agreed upon, which were the result of a rational compromise between the two sides and have now been included in the mutually agreed "six principles." But the issue is not just about formulating general principles. Egypt has in fact provided tangible guarantees for the freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal in accordance with the 1888 Convention. All of this gives reason to optimistically expect a satisfactory conclusion to the Suez issue negotiations and a victory for the principles of the United Nations.

    Shepilov then spoke about the second part of the Anglo-French proposal and expressed his opposition to this part.

    Shepilov said that the second part of the Anglo-French proposal is very regrettable, and this part in no way arises from the past negotiation process or from the work of the Security Council in these days. Lloyd and Pineau pointed out in their speeches that the first part of the proposal is to announce general principles; the second part is the implementation of these principles. We cannot agree with such an interpretation of the second part of the proposal.

    The basic proposition of this part of the proposal is that the so-called "Eighteen-Nation Proposal" should be used as the basis for continued negotiations. It is quite obvious that the first part of the proposal cannot be reconciled with the second part. Because the first part stipulates the six mutually agreed principles that should be the starting point for continued negotiations, while the second part is not only not the result of preliminary negotiations, nor does it reflect any degree of agreement, but instead repeats the fundamentally divisive arguments between the parties without any changes. The only difference from before is that now Egypt is to be ordered to accept the so-called "Eighteen-Nation Proposal" in the name of the Security Council. If the Security Council were to force Egypt to accept these proposals, which it has not agreed to and has opposed, it would mean predetermining the future outcome of the negotiations, and forcibly establishing as the basis for negotiations a concept that one party clearly cannot accept. Therefore, the Security Council cannot endorse the second part of the Anglo-French proposal recommending the so-called "Eighteen-Nation Proposal." Several clauses of this plan substantially infringe on the rights of a sovereign state and would lead to interference in Egypt's internal affairs. This is not in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.

    Shepilov also expressed opposition to the last paragraph of the Anglo-French proposal, which stipulates that before the conclusion of an agreement establishing the Suez Canal system, the "Users' Association" has full power to collect canal tolls and that the Egyptian government cooperates with the "Association." Shepilov said that the Soviet Union has never opposed the proposition that canal users should express their opinions and wishes in an organized manner, nor does it oppose the establishment of some form of contact between the users and the Egyptian canal management authorities. But this work requires special study and an international agreement reached by all relevant countries.

    Shepilov said, however, that the "Association" mentioned in the Anglo-French proposal does not meet these requirements; in particular, it cannot be said to represent the interests of all canal users in a representative manner. This is a narrow group of countries that cannot express the views of all canal users. Shepilov pointed out that the establishment of the "Association" is a violation of the 1888 Convention. In fact, the Convention has already declared the principle that the ships of all countries can freely pass through the Suez Canal. At present, a small number of countries are demanding to exercise special functions, which, according to their claims, are actually functions of managing the canal to some extent. But this is a matter to be specially discussed and stipulated by a special agreement.

    Shepilov said that the last part of the proposal not only suggests approving the so-called "Canal Users' Association" in the name of the Security Council, but even comes up with more tricks. The proposal suggests that the members of the "Canal Users' Association" pay tolls to the association and that the Egyptian authorities cooperate with the "Association." This goes even further than the "Eighteen-Nation Proposal," and is even more demanding than the original Anglo-French proposal on this issue.

    Shepilov pointed out that the issue of establishing the "Association" has not been discussed by the Security Council, and in this regard, there is no reason to require the Council to pass an unfounded resolution and predetermine a certain system of paying tolls without negotiation.

    Shepilov pointed out that if the Security Council approves the second part of the Anglo-French proposal and the measures suggested in the proposal (even if they are temporary measures), it will not only fail to ease tensions, normalize the situation, and resolve the Suez issue, but will only worsen the situation. Therefore, the Soviet representative cannot support the second part of the Anglo-French proposal.

    Shepilov finally said that the main goal that the Soviet Union is striving for is to ensure lasting peace in the Middle East and a just resolution of the Suez issue. The Soviet government is willing to do everything possible to promote a peaceful resolution of the Suez issue. The Soviet government hopes that the Security Council will be able to fulfill its mission and adopt resolutions that conform to the lofty and just principles of the United Nations Charter.

### 谢皮洛夫在安理会上赞同六项原则  指出英法提案的第二部分只能使情势恶化

    谢皮洛夫在安理会上赞同六项原则
    指出英法提案的第二部分只能使情势恶化
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社纽约14日讯：苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫10月13日在安全理事会会议上发言。他说明了苏联对英法两国新提案的态度，并且强调指出协商方法是解决苏伊士问题的唯一正确的方法。
    谢皮洛夫说：安全理事会会议开始工作的时候，情况是十分令人不安的。当时在正确解决苏伊士问题的道路上充斥着的各种困难和障碍没有能够清除掉，这条道路被人为地堵塞了起来。现在这些困难和障碍还没有清除。但是终究出现了局势好转的趋势。在复杂的苏伊士问题上应用协商方法的初步经验不仅证明这一方法可行，而且使我们大家可以有根据地希望能够求得彼此同意的公正的解决。
    谢皮洛夫说，过去几天的情况表明，安全理事会会议的召开，使英法两国代表同埃及代表有了可能就苏伊士问题建立接触。这无疑是一个具有积极意义的事实，这是应当归功于联合国的。由于英法两国外交部长同埃及外交部长在联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的积极有效的参加下交换了意见，双方得以通过协商求得某些大家同意的一般的原则，今后应当根据这些原则制定和平解决苏伊士问题的具体措施和相应的办法。
    谢皮洛夫接着谈到英法两国的新提案说：英法新提案的第一部分，就是包括这些原则的那一部分，必然会获得安全理事会的一致赞同。他说，如果说，达成协议的困难现在已经克服了，那当然是把事情看得太简单了。看来还会有不少困难，然而提案的第一部分已经奠定了良好的开端。巩固初步成就和保证使谈判继续得到有成效的发展，是联合国荣誉攸关的事情。
    苏联认为，初步谈判已经为就苏伊士问题谋求彼此同意的解决提供了重要的前提。
    谢皮洛夫说，在安全理事会会议期间可以明显地看出，埃及同意：第一，在既考虑埃及的主权和权利又考虑运河使用国的利益的条件下，管理苏伊士运河的埃及当局同运河使用国之间建立合作制度。第二，埃及同意建立征收通行费和费用的制度，收费时保证对运河使用国一视同仁，没有任何歧视。第三，埃及同意从运河的收入中按合理的比例拨出一笔专款来改善运河。此外还商定了其他一些重要的条款，这些条款是双方理智地妥协的结果，现在已经列入彼此同意的“六项原则”之中。但是问题还不只在于拟定了一般原则。埃及实际上已经按照1888年公约切实地保证苏伊士运河的航行自由。所有这些都使人有理由乐观地期待苏伊士问题谈判圆满结束、联合国原则得到胜利。
    谢皮洛夫接着谈到英法提案的第二部分，并且对这一部分表示反对。
    谢皮洛夫说，英法提案的第二部分是令人十分遗憾的，这一部分无论如何不是从过去的谈判过程中、从安全理事会这些天的工作中产生的。劳埃德和比诺在发言中指出，提案的第一部分是宣布一般原则；第二部分是这些原则的实行。我们无论如何不能同意对提案的第二部分作这样的解释。
    提案的这一部分的基本主张是，应该以所谓“十八国方案”作为继续谈判的基础。十分明显，提案的第一部分是不可能同第二部分调和起来的。因为第一部分规定了应该成为继续谈判的出发点的彼此同意的六项原则，而第二部分不仅不是初步谈判的结果，不仅不反映出某种程度的协议，反而原封不动地重复提出了各方之间有根本分歧的提法。和以前的不同仅仅在于，现在要以安全理事会的名义命令埃及接受所谓“十八国方案”。如果安全理事会竟强迫埃及接受这些未经它同意并且曾经受到它反对的方案，这就意味着事先决定谈判的未来结果，事先硬把一方分明不能接受的观念定为谈判的基础。因此，安全理事会不能够赞同推荐所谓“十八国方案”的英法提案的第二部分。这个方案的若干条款实质上侵犯了一个主权国家的权利，会导致对埃及的内政的干涉。这是不符合联合国宪章的。
    谢皮洛夫还表示反对英法提案的最后一段，就是规定在最后建立苏伊士运河制度的协定缔结以前，运河“使用国协会”有全权征收运河通行费以及规定埃及政府同“协会”实行合作的一段。谢皮洛夫说，苏联过去和现在都不反对运河使用国有组织地表达它们的意见和愿望这种主张，也不反对使用国和埃及的运河管理当局之间建立一定形式的联系。但是这项工作需要进行专门研究，需要一切有关国家达成国际协定。
    谢皮洛夫说，但是，英法提案所提到的“协会”并不符合这些要求；尤其是谈不上有代表性地表达全体运河使用国的利益。这是一个狭隘的国家集团，它不能表达全体运河使用国的意见。谢皮洛夫指出，建立“协会”是违反1888年公约的。事实上，公约已经宣布了一切国家的船只可以自由通过苏伊士运河的原则。而在目前，一小撮国家要求行使特殊的职能，按照它们的声言，这种职能实际上在某种程度上是管理运河的职能。但是这是要特别讨论和由特别协议规定的问题。
    谢皮洛夫说，提案的最后一部分不仅建议以安全理事会的名义批准所谓“运河使用国协会”，甚至还搞出更多花样。提案建议，“运河使用国协会”的成员国向协会支付通行费，埃及当局同“协会”合作。这甚至比“十八国方案”更进一步，甚至比原先的英法提案关于这方面的提法更加苛刻。
    谢皮洛夫指出，关于成立“协会”的问题并没有经安全理事会讨论，在这方面没有理由要求理事会通过没有根据的决议，并且未经谈判就预先规定某种支付通行费的制度。
    谢皮洛夫指出，如果安全理事会批准英法提案的第二部分和提案中所建议的措施（尽管是临时的措施），那不仅不能使紧张局势和缓，使情势正常化，使苏伊士问题得到解决，反而只能使情势恶化。因此，苏联代表不能支持英法提案的第二部分。
    谢皮洛夫最后说，苏联所致力的主要目标是保证中近东的持久和平和公正地解决苏伊士问题。苏联政府愿意尽一切力量促成苏伊士问题的和平解决。苏联政府希望，安全理事会能够胜任自己的任务，并且通过符合联合国宪章的崇高和公正原则的决议。
