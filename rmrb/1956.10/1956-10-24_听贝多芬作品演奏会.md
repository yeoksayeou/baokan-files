    Listening to a Beethoven Concert
    Zeng Lizhong
    The recent Beethoven concert in Beijing by the Central Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by the highly respected Professor W. Gosling from East Germany, was not only a very attractive performance, but also a valuable demonstration of the cooperation between the Chinese and German people in cultural and artistic endeavors.
    Beethoven wrote a total of nine symphonies, and the Sixth Symphony ("Pastoral Symphony") performed this time is a work that is relatively easy for the masses to understand and welcome.
      "Pastoral Symphony" begins in an extremely gentle and poetic mood, and is quite different from the magnificent spirit of Beethoven's "Eroica Symphony." In this work, Beethoven brings the most beautiful scenes of nature into the imagination of the audience, making people feel as if they are immersed in an atmosphere of peace and happiness. The first movement, "Awakening of Cheerful Feelings Upon Arrival in the Country," the second movement, "Scene by the Brook," and the third movement, "Merry Gathering of Country Folk," all have a very pleasant mood. This joy sometimes seems so leisurely and content, and sometimes so jubilant. It was not until the appearance of the fourth movement, "Thunder. Storm," that this peaceful scene was disrupted. The rapid lightning and thunder made you worry about the nightingales and cuckoos that sang in the second movement. Just as people recall certain lost beautiful things, the impressions left by the previous movements become even more beautiful at this time. However, the thunderstorm finally passed, the clouds cleared, and the sound of pastoral songs came from afar. Everything returned to tranquility, and the music entered the fifth movement, "Shepherd’s Song. Cheerful and Thankful Feelings After the Storm." Hearing this, one cannot help but think of Wang Mian's description of encountering rain while grazing cattle in the first chapter of "The Scholars": "After a burst of heavy rain... the mountains by the lake were patches of blue, purple, and green. The branches of the trees looked as if they had been washed, and were especially lovely." Listening to "Pastoral Symphony" indeed gives people the feeling of "being in a painting." In this symphony, Beethoven not only depicted a vivid picture of peace, but also expressed his love for the mountains and rivers of his motherland.
    In another work performed this time, the "Egmont Overture," Beethoven used his unique strong emotion to praise the sixteenth-century Dutch nobleman, Count Egmont, for leading the people's national liberation struggle against Spanish rule; revealing the people's suffering, their pursuit of freedom and liberation, and their invincible confidence.
    Professor W. Gosling, the veteran conductor, is one of the three most famous conductors in Germany. He has profound insights and rich conducting experience in Beethoven's works, and his expressive techniques are extremely rigorous, simple, refined and clear; he is an extremely profound interpreter of Beethoven's music.
    Assisting Professor W. Gosling in rehearsals were Comrade Hoffmann, a horn expert, and Comrade Kresteman, a clarinet expert, from East Germany. Under their guidance and help, the Central Philharmonic Orchestra has made significant progress in its performance techniques; in terms of correctly expressing Beethoven's great democratic ideas, it is even more perfect than ever before.

    听贝多芬作品演奏会
    曾理中
    由民主德国很有威望的老指挥维·戈斯林教授担任指挥的、中央乐团交响乐队最近在北京举行的贝多芬作品演奏会，不但演出非常吸引人，而且体现出中德两国人民在文化艺术事业合作上的可贵情谊。
    贝多芬一共写过九个交响乐，这次演出的第六交响乐（田园交响乐），是一首群众较易了解和欢迎的作品。
      “田园交响乐”是在一种极其温和的诗意中开始的，和贝多芬所写的“英雄交响乐”那种雄伟豪迈的气质比起来，是另具一格。在这个作品里，贝多芬把大自然中最美好的景象，引进到听众的想像中来，使人像是沉浸在和平幸福的气氛里。第一乐章“初到乡间时的快乐印象”，第二乐章“溪边小景”，以及第三乐章“农民快乐的宴会”，都有着一种很愉快的情绪。这种愉快有时显得那么怡然自得，有时却又那么欢腾。一直到第四乐章“暴风雨”的出现，才破坏了这种和平的景象，疾速的闪电和雷声，使你听来不禁为在第二乐章里歌唱过的夜莺和杜鹃担心。就像人们在想起某些已失去了的美好东西一样，前几个乐章给你留下的印象，这时就越显得美好了。然而雷雨终于远去，云散天晴，远远地传来了牧歌的声音，一切又重归安宁，这时音乐就已经进入到第五乐章“牧歌，雷雨后的快慰与感激”了。听到这里，使人不禁想起“儒林外史”第一回中王冕放牛遇雨后的描写来：“一阵大雨过了。……湖边山上，青一块，紫一块，绿一块。树枝上都像水洗过一番的，尤其绿得可爱。”听“田园交响乐”，的确使人有
  “人在画图中”的感觉。贝多芬在这个交响乐里不仅描画出了一幅鲜明的和平景象，而且也表现了对他的祖国山河的热爱。
    在这次演出的另一个作品“哀格蒙序曲”里，贝多芬以他那种特有的强烈感情，歌颂了十六世纪荷兰贵族哀格蒙伯爵，领导人民反抗西班牙统治的民族解放斗争；揭示出人民的苦难、对自由解放的追求和不可战胜的信心。
    老指挥维·戈斯林教授，是德国三大名指挥家之一。他对贝多芬的作品有精辟的见解和丰富的指挥经验，表现手法极严谨朴素而又洗练鲜明；是贝多芬音乐的极深刻的解释者。
    协助维·戈斯林教授排练的，还有民主德国的圆号专家霍夫曼同志和黑管专家克列斯特曼同志。中央乐团交响乐队在他们的指导和帮助下，演奏技术已有了显著的提高；在正确地表达贝多芬的伟大民主思想上来说，那就更比过去任何时候都完美多了。
