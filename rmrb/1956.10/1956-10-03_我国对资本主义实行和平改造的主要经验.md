Our Country's Main Experience in the Peaceful Transformation of Capitalism
Hu Xikui

(Editor's Note: Comrade Hu Xikui delivered a scientific report entitled "On the Peaceful Transformation of Capitalist Industry and Commerce and Class Struggle in Our Country" at the Sixth Scientific Discussion Conference of Renmin University of China. What is published here is the last part of his report.)

On the road of peaceful transformation, the struggle of who will win between capitalism and socialism is currently resolved with a decisive victory for socialism. Although this is not the final complete victory over the transformation of capitalism, it is indeed a decisive victory with great historical significance for changing capitalist ownership. Capitalist enterprises have been handed over to cadres appointed by the state to lead, capitalists no longer continue to control enterprises, and they themselves have become general managers of enterprises. The shares they hold only receive interest according to the fixed interest rate method. The relations of production have undergone fundamental changes, and the socialist transformation of capitalism has taken a big step forward. Transforming capitalism into state capitalism first, and then nationalizing it, these are the two steps, or two stages, of our country's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. The transition from the first stage to the second stage is still a process of arduous struggle, which is to completely replace capitalist management methods with socialist management methods and further implement socialist reforms in enterprises. At the same time, all capitalists who are willing to accept transformation must be ideologically reformed using the socialist method of self-education. Then, after a certain period of gradual maturation, the final stage of socialist transformation—nationalization—will be victoriously passed along the inevitable trend of social development.

In the first stage of our country's transformation of capitalism, the center of the struggle was to change the relations of production to liberate productive forces, but the struggle against the bourgeoisie's ideology was not relaxed either. This struggle has had a basic victorious ending, so what main work experiences can be drawn from this victorious struggle?

(1) The great victory achieved in our country's socialist transformation of capitalism is the victory of the Marxist-Leninist strategic line. The correctness and flexibility of this strategic line lie first in grasping the main domestic contradictions and all their characteristics, and taking the special struggle methods of restricting and anti-restricting in the struggle of who will win between the two roads of capitalism and socialism as the most fundamental starting point of socialist revolution strategy and class struggle. The working class cannot win the victory in this struggle if it does not deeply understand this revolutionary particularity. It is precisely because the Party and the state have grasped this particularity of the main contradiction and put forward the policy of peacefully transforming capitalism in line with our country's specific historical characteristics, according to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, that our country has obtained the most basic guarantee for the great victory of the socialist transformation of capitalism. At the same time, the Party and the state have not relaxed another contradiction for a moment, that is, the contradiction between the people of our country and imperialism. The fact that imperialism is not reconciled to its failure in China is also very obvious. In addition, there is also the contradiction between the advanced regime that has been established and the economic backwardness of our country, intertwined with the above contradictions. In the past, some people simply saw the bourgeoisie and the working class as antagonistic contradictions, but did not understand that in addition to this contradiction, there were also national contradictions and the contradiction between our country's advanced state power and backward economy. It is precisely because of the mutual influence of these contradictions that the working class not only needs to correctly resolve this antagonistic contradiction, but also needs to maintain a political and economic alliance with the bourgeoisie on the basis of the increasingly consolidated worker-peasant alliance, in order to maximize the isolation of the enemies of the Chinese people and facilitate our country's rapid transition from healing economic wounds to socialist economic construction. Now, after six or seven years, the practice of socialist construction and transformation has proved that the Party's policies are not only generally correct, but also extremely flexible, which is of great educational significance to the Party and state cadres and the people of the whole country. Now the first stage of our country's socialist transformation of capitalism has come to a victorious end. Although the bourgeoisie as a class has not yet been eliminated, the vast majority of capitalists have given up resistance and handed over their enterprises to the public representatives sent by the state to the joint state-private enterprises for leadership and management. Most capitalists and capitalist agents have become employees of the joint state-private enterprises, and cannot but work together under the direct leadership of public representatives and the supervision of the masses of workers, according to socialist principles. Now, among capitalists and capitalist agents, the proportion of progressive elements is increasing day by day, and there is a tendency for them to change from a minority to a majority. From the fact that capitalist enterprises and capitalists are gradually obtaining socialist transformation, it is sufficient to fully illustrate the great achievements of the Party's policies and their decisive role in the cause of peacefully transforming capitalism.

From this, it can be seen that the main reason why our country was able to achieve the peaceful transformation of capitalism and why the bourgeoisie abandoned resistance and were willing to accept socialist transformation is that the Party adopted the correct policy of the People's Democratic United Front based on the current historical characteristics of the socialist revolution in China, with unity and struggle, seeking unity through struggle, and unity for the sake of transformation, mainly educating them. Precisely because there was a correct policy, our country's plan for the socialist transformation of capitalism was not only suitable for the requirements of social economic laws, in line with the interests of the working class and the needs of socialist construction, but also accepted by representatives of the bourgeoisie, and finally welcomed by the large number of capitalists. From the perspective of the vast majority of capitalists, due to the development of the socialist economy, the leap forward of the socialist transformation of agriculture, and the active urging of the masses of workers and shop assistants in private enterprises, the Party's unity and struggle, patient education, personnel arrangements, and lenient consideration in terms of inventory, valuation, asset verification, and fixed interest rates have promoted their increasing awareness, making them gradually realize that it is indeed impossible to take the capitalist road in China, and that taking the socialist road is the only way out. At the same time, from their own experiences, they gradually realized that their own future is inseparable from the prosperity and strength of the motherland. The process of peacefully transforming capitalism most vividly illustrates that the socialist system is far superior to the capitalist system. At the same time, the peaceful transformation plan adopted by our country for capitalism is indeed reasonable and acceptable to the vast majority of capitalists. Even if capitalist ownership is completely eliminated in the future, their work and life will be guaranteed, so giving up resistance and accepting socialist transformation is also beneficial to themselves and their descendants. Experience has proved that the working class, having seized state power, should adopt peaceful methods to carry out the socialist transformation of capitalism, and should have a high degree of principle and flexibility in leadership, adhere to the policy of the united front with unity and struggle, and adopt the method of persuasive education combined with actual struggle, consolidate and improve the progressive elements who support socialism, strive for the intermediate elements, and gradually turn the backward elements to learn from the progressive elements, and divide the die-hards, in order to unite the majority, weaken resistance, and facilitate socialist transformation. Here, it is necessary to oppose both left-leaning empty talk in the process of peacefully transforming capitalism and unprincipled compromise of right-leaning conservatism, both to safeguard the long-term interests of the working class and to have a plan that can be accepted by the vast majority of the bourgeoisie. As long as there is such a very clear but also very firm policy and a specific implementation plan, and it can be adhered to and fought to the end, then we can not only win the decisive victory of the socialist transformation of capitalism, but also certainly win the final complete victory of this struggle.

It must be pointed out here: whether this strategic line policy can be implemented, the central key is to have a correct analysis and comprehensive understanding of the dual nature of the national bourgeoisie, in order to ensure that no mistakes are made in deciding the Party's strategic line policy, and that it can be correctly implemented in actual work. On the contrary, if a subjective method is adopted towards the national bourgeoisie, mainly a dogmatic method, that is, denying the active side of the bourgeoisie, exaggerating the negative side, and opposing the Party's strategic line policy. If this error is not discovered and corrected in time, it will cause undue losses in work. This is a "left" opportunist tendency. At the same time, right opportunist tendencies have also occurred in the process of transforming capitalism, which is to only see the active side of the bourgeoisie, ignore the negative side of the bourgeoisie, and therefore be paralyzed, accommodate, and retreat to the bourgeoisie, which will also cause certain losses to our work. These two erroneous tendencies have ideological, historical, and social roots. The resolution of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party and the article "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" published in the People's Daily not long ago have clearly pointed out the harmfulness of dogmatism. After the Zunyi Conference in 1935, the three left-leaning opportunist lines during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War were ended, and dogmatism no longer occupied a dominant position in the Party. The Marxist-Leninist leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong led the whole Party. The rectification movement in Yan'an and various anti-Japanese revolutionary base areas in 1942 alerted the cadres of the whole Party and the broad masses, enabling the Party to rely on the masses, thus bringing into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people, winning the victory of the people's democratic revolution, and then advancing to the victory of the socialist revolution, achieving a decisive victory in the socialist revolution. In our country's peaceful transformation of capitalism, we must always pay attention to overcoming the tendency of dogmatism. Without the struggle to overcome the tendency of dogmatism, obstacles will occur in some aspects. "Left" leaning comes from the mechanical transportation of the so-called theory of isolating intermediate forces, which is a well-known dogmatism from the "left" side. Similarly, right leaning is the abandonment of the leadership of the working class and unprincipled compromise with the bourgeoisie, which comes from the opportunist "theory" boasted by the Second International. Therefore, our minds must be clear, and we must always maintain a high degree of vigilance. This is not only very important for practical workers, but should be said to be even more important for theoretical workers. All those engaged in practical work and theoretical research should follow the instructions of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, always be vigilant about the harmfulness of dogmatism, earnestly achieve close integration of theory and practice, and organically link the study of Marxism-Leninism with the implementation of the Party's strategies, lines, policies, and policies, and struggle to welcome the new victory of the socialist revolution.

(2) The struggle for the peaceful transformation of capitalism in our country is a creative application of the Marxist-Leninist theories on peaceful transition, the policy of redemption, and Lenin's theory on state capitalism, which have been concretized, making these theories and policies extremely fully realized under China's specific conditions.

State capitalism is not an independent economic form. Its nature, role, and purpose of service depend on the social system and the nature of the country. Under the capitalist social system, state power is manipulated by the bourgeoisie, and state capitalism is a form of capitalism, an economy of a capitalist nature, serving the interests of the bourgeoisie, so as to facilitate the bourgeoisie's opposition to the proletariat. Under the new social system, in a country under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the state capitalist economy is another matter. The nature and boundaries of these two types of state capitalism must be distinguished, otherwise it is easy to cause ideological confusion, unstable positions, and shake and deviate from the Party's correct strategic line policy. State capitalism in our country is also a transitional economic form, that is, in the period of transition from capitalism to socialism, the capitalist economic components are transformed into socialist economic components; it is not capitalism in the ordinary sense, it is capitalism that is led by the working class state, supervised by the masses of workers, and connected and cooperated with the socialist state-owned economy in various ways, is "a capitalism that we can limit, that we can define its boundaries" (Lenin), is an economic form that serves the interests of the working class and is used to gradually change capitalist private ownership into socialist public ownership. Through it, capitalist ownership is gradually changed to achieve the goal of eliminating the bourgeoisie.

State capitalism is the gateway to socialism, creating favorable conditions for the nationalization of enterprises. Therefore, the steps for carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce are: the first step is to encourage and guide capitalist industry and commerce to transform into various different forms of state capitalist economy, all the way to the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry; the second step is to transform the state capitalist economy of the entire industry into a socialist economy, replacing capitalist ownership with socialist public ownership. There is no intermediate stage between these two steps. The state capitalist economy is a necessary preparation for the nationalization of enterprises, and the nationalization of enterprises is the inevitable result of the development of the state capitalist economy.

However, the development of capitalism in our country has its own process, and the development from low-level forms to high-level forms is the law of this process. And the diversification of forms is a feature of the development of state capitalism in our country. The process of state capitalism developing from low-level forms to high-level forms is the process of gradually strengthening state administrative management, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the masses of workers, that is, the economic alliance between socialist economic components and capitalist economic components, and the gradual deepening and growth of socialist factors from the outside to the inside. With the change of this process, the management methods and relations of production within capitalist enterprises will gradually change.

The development of state capitalism from low-level forms to high-level forms, and which form is most appropriate as the main or basic form of the development of state capitalism in a certain period or stage, depends on the following conditions:

① It depends on the development level of social productive forces. Every step the social productive forces improve also requires the form of state capitalism to be correspondingly improved, that is, one form is replaced by another. In the past, a certain form was still the most appropriate as the main form or basic form, and it could solve the requirements put forward by the objective economic life at that time, but under the conditions of further development of productive forces, and after new situations have emerged in the state's industrialization and agricultural cooperativization, then that most appropriate form will appear old and backward, and even become a serious obstacle to the further development of productive forces, and it has to be replaced by another form, that is, a higher-level form. At that time, not only the intermediate form of state capitalism, such as processing orders, had to be transformed or upgraded to the high-level form of joint state-private ownership, but also a universal requirement was to leap forward and advance to the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry, which is what the development of social economic laws requires. Because each form of state capitalism reflects a certain relations of production, and the change of form is the development of relations of production. Otherwise, the relations of production will still not be able to meet the requirements of the nature of productive forces, and it will also affect the further transformation of capitalism. At the same time, the continuous growth of the leadership force of the state-owned economy plays an extremely important role in promoting the development of state capitalism from low-level forms to high-level forms. When the strength of the state-owned economy is not very strong and the leading position is not very consolidated, it is difficult for capitalists to accept the high-level forms of state capitalism, and even take a resistant attitude, and the actual economic life cannot require state capitalism to appear in its highest form from the beginning. However, when the strength of the state-owned economy has grown and the leading position has been consolidated, it will be extremely inappropriate for state capitalism to remain at the low-level stage, and it will also affect the further development of the state-owned economy and the further transformation of capitalism.

After the state entered the first five-year construction plan stage, the rapid transition of capitalist enterprises from the initial and intermediate forms of state capitalism to the high-level form, and the implementation of socialist transformation from the outside of capitalist enterprises to the inside of capitalist enterprises, is the inherent inevitable regularity of the development, change, and progress of this form.

② The gradual strengthening of national economic planning also requires state capitalism to develop from low-level forms to high-level forms. Due to the bourgeoisie's essence of seeking profit, they are indifferent to improving product quality and reducing costs. Capitalist enterprises lack planning and are in a state of anarchy in production, which is completely opposed to the planning of the national economy and is not conducive to the development of the national economy. After transforming capitalist industry and commerce into various different forms of state capitalist economy, they are, to varying degrees, brought into the orbit of national planning. The development of state capitalism from low-level forms to high-level forms is also a process of gradual adaptation to national economic planning.

③ The major measures taken by the Party and the state for the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce are one of the important conditions for promoting the development of state capitalism from low-level forms to high-level forms, and are an indispensable factor for replacing one form with another. Because the economic measures taken by the Party and the state are the result of consciously applying objective economic laws, the implementation of these measures has opened up the road for the development of state capitalism, strengthened the influence of the basic socialist economic laws on capitalist enterprises, thereby promoting the development of state capitalism from low-level forms to high-level forms.

The above three conditions will help to understand why state capitalism is bound to develop from low-level forms to high-level forms, why there are so many form changes, and why only this form and not that form can be used as the main or basic form of the development of state capitalism in a certain period and stage. Any attempt to talk about the change and development of the form of state capitalism in isolation from these conditions is incomprehensible. Moreover, the development and change of the form of state capitalism from low-level to high-level precisely illustrates that the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce by the Party and the state is gradually deepening, and the capitalist relations of production are gradually changing. Without this transitional economic form of state capitalism, and without the development and change of state capitalism from low-level forms to high-level forms, there would be no socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

In the cause of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, the forms of state capitalism are divided into three types: low-level forms, intermediate forms, and high-level forms. However, due to the difference between industry and commerce, the content of various forms of state capitalism is also different. In industry, the forms of state capitalism are: the low-level form is purchasing, the intermediate form is processing orders, unified purchasing and sales, and the high-level form is individual joint state-private ownership and joint state-private ownership of the entire industry. In commerce, the forms of state capitalism are: the low-level form is wholesale and retail; the intermediate form is distribution and consignment; and the high-level form is individual joint state-private ownership and joint state-private ownership of the entire industry.

The entire state capitalism develops from low-level to high-level, its forms and steps are diversified, the method is gradual, gradually occupying positions, and advancing steadily. However, these transitional forms for transforming capitalism are very flexible, and some do not necessarily go through the state capitalism gradually rising from low-level to high-level forms in a rigid manner, and some can also directly transition to nationalization across the state capitalism stage. But no matter how the transition is, the following two issues must be paid attention to: ① The personnel and funds of the original enterprise must be properly arranged; ② Only when it is necessary and conditions are met can the method of cross-level transition be adopted. Usually, the transitional form of gradual rise in three levels is still adopted.

The intermediate form of processing orders is the starting point for incorporating capitalist production into the state plan, and at the same time directly prepares conditions for the high-level form of joint state-private ownership. Therefore, processing orders has played a huge bridging role and a positive role in the peaceful transformation of capitalist industry. This is manifested in the following aspects:

① Through processing orders, the purchase of raw materials and the sales of products are stuck, cutting off the connection between capitalists and the market. In production, he must ensure the quantity, quality, specifications, and timely completion of the order tasks, and initially bring capitalist enterprises into the orbit of the state plan.

② Through processing orders, the production links between the same industry and between industries are closely connected, so that capitalist industry can go from decentralized to centralized, technicalities are disclosed, experiences are exchanged, and the improvement of management methods is also appropriately promoted, creating conditions for joint state-private ownership.

③ Through processing orders, the calculation of wages, working hours, and management fees as processing fees appropriately reduces the cost price and limits the profits of capitalists.

④ Through processing orders, the active side of the bourgeoisie is encouraged, and their resistance to transformation and illegal side are attacked.

It is precisely because processing orders has this bridging role and positive role that it often fights with capitalists for self-production and self-sales, free markets, and free prices. Relying on the development of this intermediate form of struggle, gradually overcome the resistance of the bourgeoisie, and then further guide capitalists to continue to advance to joint state-private ownership. It cannot stay in the form of processing orders, because this form has loopholes, and capitalists are willing to stay in the processing order stage. Processing orders allow capitalists to take processing fees (or called processing fees), and the capitalists' profits are extracted according to the processing fees. Therefore, capitalists are unwilling to reduce processing costs and are unwilling to save materials. In order to increase their profit margin, they use the method of raising processing costs as the water rises, some falsely report costs, some indiscriminately pay wages to employees, or establish unreasonable reward systems, and take the opportunity to make a fortune themselves. Effective reforms cannot be carried out in management methods, the organization is large and complex, there are redundant personnel, finances are chaotic, production is unplanned, and waste is serious, resulting in high costs and low product quality. Therefore, if processing orders exist for a long time, productive forces cannot be further liberated and developed.

The transition from purchasing and sales to processing orders, then from processing orders to joint state-private ownership, and then from joint state-private ownership of the entire industry to nationalization, is a series of very normal and sound transitional forms and methods.

We divide the socialist transformation of capitalism into two stages. The first stage goes through the development of state capitalism from low-level to high-level in three forms, and then turns to the second stage and enters the stage of complete socialism, that is, nationalization. The key to deciding the outcome of the struggle is mainly in the first stage, and going through state capitalism is a relatively sound form of struggle and organizational form for carrying out peaceful transformation.

(3) Whether the working class, having seized state power, can firmly grasp economic leadership is a matter of success or failure in the revolutionary struggle. Imperialism once hoped that we would have to beg them or rely on them to live. The bourgeoisie also once estimated that we would not be able to engage in economic work or carry out economic struggles. They had doubts about our leadership role on the economic front. Naturally, it is also true that the skills of the working class in our country were not very good at first, but the working class and its party, the Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, have a glorious fighting tradition, that is, constantly learning in work and struggle to improve their skills and educate others. At the beginning of the founding of the country, in view of historical lessons and the importance of socialist economic construction tasks, in addition to strengthening the leadership of the state-owned economy and the cooperative economy, the Party emphasized putting the development of production in the first place in the peaceful transformation of capitalism, closely combining the development of production with the socialist transformation of capitalism, and opposing mutually opposed views and practices. Therefore, the various forms of struggle in the first stage of our country's peaceful transformation of capitalism have not left the central link of developing production. Any practice contrary to this will suffer losses and setbacks. Even during the most intense period of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, there was no delay in both struggle and production. When the high tide of joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce arrived, the whole country also launched a struggle that did not delay both joint ownership and production. Therefore, being good at grasping the link of production and being good at combining production with other struggles is one of the fundamental reasons why socialism is invincible.

At the beginning of the founding of the country, the Party called on the masses of employees in private enterprises to help capitalists overcome difficulties and maintain production. To do a good job in production, it is necessary to maintain the normalization of commodity and currency circulation and maintain the stability of the market, finance, and prices. As mentioned earlier, many capitalists were passive in production and enthusiastic about speculation and profiteering. At this time, the Party launched a struggle against speculation and profiteering and stabilizing the market, finance, and prices. The victory of these two aspects of struggle enabled the capitalist economy at that time to turn from recovery to development. In February of this year, the State Council issued instructions that the economic reorganization (that is, production reorganization) after the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry should be carried out with preparation and caution, in order to prevent the development of production from being affected by careless economic reorganization. After the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry in Shanghai, it first grasped production and management to meet the huge task of completing the double-wheeled double-plow urgently needed for agricultural production, and then carried out inventory and asset verification. The economic reorganization was handled in accordance with the spirit of the instructions of the State Council, so a labor competition production upsurge immediately appeared in the joint state-private enterprises, which also promoted the economic reorganization to be carried out in a prepared and orderly manner. The Party and the state have always emphasized production first in both the recovery period and the construction period, and closely combined it with various struggles, because only in this way can the superiority of the socialist system be demonstrated, and the working class itself be placed in an active and invincible position.

(4) To achieve this victory, consolidate this victory, and expand this victory (that is, the dual transformation of capitalism from the first stage to the second stage), what are its prerequisites and prerequisites? It is the people's democratic dictatorship led by the Chinese working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. The Party uses the power of the people's democratic dictatorship, uses all favorable conditions at home and abroad, guarantees and protects the peaceful transition to socialism, and guarantees and protects the smooth socialist transformation of capitalism. Marxism-Leninism sums up the experience of world revolutionary history and tells us that "the question of political power is the fundamental question of any revolution." On the eve of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that "the people have a powerful state machine in their hands and are not afraid of the national bourgeoisie rebelling." Therefore, in China in the twentieth century, leaving the proletarian regime (no matter what method is used or what path is taken to seize power), that is to say, if the proletariat does not hold power and wants to peacefully transform to socialism, this cannot but be a fantasy. It should be said that the truth that "the question of political power is the fundamental question of any revolution" has been confirmed once again in the practice of socialist revolution in our country.

(5) Our country was originally a semi-colonial and semi-feudal backward country. After winning the victory of the people's democratic revolution, it immediately turned to the socialist revolution and rapidly turned from the economic recovery period to the socialist construction period. On the major principled issues of eliminating capitalist ownership and eliminating the bourgeoisie, it adopted the policy and steps of gradual advancement and active transformation, and creatively applied and developed Marxism-Leninism, thus providing a new model for eliminating capitalist ownership and eliminating the bourgeoisie in backward countries. This proves that different countries have different methods, forms, and paths for transitioning from democratic revolution to socialist revolution. The October Socialist Revolution was the first socialist revolution in human history. This revolution took place in a country like Russia where capitalism had developed to the stage of imperialism. Due to the different domestic and international situations, the balance of class forces, and the attitude of the bourgeoisie at that time, the elimination of capitalist ownership and the elimination of the bourgeoisie in Russia provided the first model of socialist revolution. In the future, in the world revolutionary process, countries with different historical circumstances from our country will provide other models for eliminating capitalist ownership and the bourgeoisie. The principle of Marxism-Leninism is to make specific analysis according to specific circumstances and apply it flexibly. Due to the different internal situations and international environment of each country at that time, the forms and paths for the working class, having seized power, to transition from capitalism to socialism will not be completely the same. Our country's peaceful transformation of capitalism is proof of this truth and therefore has great international significance.

The great international significance of our country's peaceful transformation of capitalism also lies in the implementation of the method and steps of combining dual transformation. On the one hand, the socialist transformation of capitalist enterprises is gradually carried out, and various forms of state capitalism are passed through, and finally nationalization is achieved. On the other hand, the bourgeoisie are gradually subjected to socialist ideological transformation, and the vast majority of capitalists are transformed into self-reliant laborers. Practice has proved that under certain conditions, the class nature of people is not impossible to change. The basic principle of Marxism is that existence determines consciousness. If capitalist enterprises enter the process of being gradually transformed, that is, the economic foundation of the bourgeoisie is gradually disintegrating. Since the existence of capitalists is to be gradually changed, then it is also possible to change the consciousness of capitalists and change their class nature. If the ideology of capitalists is gradually transformed, then consciousness can in turn affect existence. It is precisely because we have adopted the method of dual transformation that the result is that through a certain amount of education and struggle, both capitalist enterprises and the majority of capitalists can achieve the purpose of transformation. Such an ending is unprecedented in history and is most beneficial to the working class. Of course, this systematic and complete experience of dual transformation still needs to be accumulated and summarized in the future, but this method of combining enterprise transformation and human transformation has indeed opened a new prelude on the stage of international proletarian struggle.

The historical fact of our country's peaceful transition to socialism has an extremely huge international significance, and it also lies in the fact that it is in a large country with a population of 600 million, which has permanently broken away from the capitalist world system and entered the socialist world system. This cannot but have a decisive role in defending peace in Asia, defending world peace, and promoting the cause of human progress; the blow to the imperialist forces of aggression, the encouragement to the anti-colonial struggle of the oppressed nations, and the strengthening of the confidence of the nations that have freed themselves from imperialist oppression in construction all have extremely important roles.

    我国对资本主义实行和平改造的主要经验
    胡锡奎
    （编者按：胡锡奎同志曾在中国人民大学第六次科学讨论会上以“关于我国对资本主义工商业的和平改造与阶级斗争”为题作了一次科学报告，这里登载的是他报告中的最后一部分）
    在和平改造的道路上，资本主义和社会主义谁战胜谁的斗争，目前是以社会主义取得了决定性的胜利而得到解决。虽然这还不是取得对资本主义改造的最后的完全的胜利，但对改变资本主义的所有制来说，确实是一个具有伟大历史意义的决定性的胜利。资本主义的企业已经交给国家所委派的干部来领导，资本家不再继续支配企业，它本人也变成了企业的一般管理人员，所加入的股份只按定息的办法取得利息，生产关系起了根本性质的变化，资本主义的社会主义改造已向前跃进了一大步。先改造资本主义成为国家资本主义，然后再国有化，这就是我国对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的两个步骤，或者说两个阶段。从第一阶段到第二阶段还是一个艰苦斗争的过程，就是要完全用社会主义的经营管理方法代替资本主义的经营管理方法，进一步地对企业实行社会主义的改革。同时，对一切愿意接受改造的资本家，要用社会主义的自我教育的方法，进行思想改造。然后经过一定时期逐步酝酿成熟，社会主义改造最后一关——国有化，就会沿着社会发展的必然趋势，胜利地渡过去。
    我国对资本主义改造的第一阶段，斗争的中心是要改变生产关系解放生产力，但也没有放松对资产阶级的思想意识方面的斗争，这个斗争已有一个基本的胜利的结局，那么，从这个胜利的斗争中可以吸取一些什么主要的工作经验呢？
      （1）我国对资本主义的社会主义改造所取得的伟大的胜利，是马克思列宁主义的策略路线的胜利。这种策略路线的正确性和灵活性，首先在于抓住了国内的主要矛盾及其呈现的一切特性，把资本主义和社会主义两条道路谁战胜谁的斗争，限制和反限制的特殊的斗争方式，作为社会主义革命战略和阶级斗争的最根本出发点，工人阶级如果不深刻认识这一革命的特殊性，就不能赢得在这一斗争中的胜利。正由于党和国家抓住了这一个主要矛盾的特殊性，根据马克思列宁主义的原则和我国的具体历史特点，提出了切合我国情况的和平改造资本主义的方针政策，我国才取得了对资本主义的社会主义改造的伟大胜利最基本的保证。同时，党和国家也没有一时一刻放松另外一个矛盾，那就是我国人民和帝国主义之间的矛盾，帝国主义不甘心在中国的失败，也是非常明显的事实。此外，还有已经建立起来了的先进政权和我国经济落后性的矛盾，和上述矛盾错综交织。过去有一些人只是简单地看到了资产阶级和工人阶级是对抗性的矛盾，而不了解在这一矛盾之外还有民族矛盾以及我国先进的国家政权和落后性的经济之间的矛盾，正是由于这些矛盾的相互影响，工人阶级不仅需要正确地解决这个对抗性的矛盾，同时也需要在日益巩固的工农联盟的基础之上和资产阶级除保持政治经济联盟，以便最大限度地孤立中国人民的敌人，便于使我国迅速地由医治好经济的创伤转入社会主义的经济建设。现在经过了六、七年的时间，社会主义的建设和改造的实践，已经证明党的方针政策不仅是具有一般的正确性，而且具有极大的灵活性，这对于党和国家干部以及全国人民的教育意义都是很大的。现在我国对资本主义的社会主义改造第一阶段已经胜利地结束。资产阶级作为一个阶级虽然还没有被消灭掉，但是绝大多数的资本家已经放弃了抵抗，将企业交由国家派往公私合营企业的公方代表领导管理，大多数资本家和资本家代理人成为公私合营企业的从业人员，并且不能不在公方代表直接领导和工人群众的监督下，按照社会主义的原则而共同工作，现在资本家和资本家代理人中间，进步分子的比例日益增加，有由少数变成多数的趋势。从资本主义的企业和资本家逐步地获得社会主义改造这一事实来看，就足以充分说明党的方针政策巨大的成就及其在和平改造资本主义事业中的决定作用。
    由此可见，我国对资本主义之所以能够实现和平改造，资产阶级分子之所以放弃抵抗愿意接受社会主义的改造，主要的是由于党根据社会主义革命现阶段的中国历史特点，采取了正确的人民民主统一战线的方针政策，有团结有斗争，以斗争求团结，而团结是为了改造，主要地是教育他们。正因为有了正确的政策，我国对资本主义的社会主义改造的方案，就不仅是适合于社会经济规律的要求，符合于工人阶级利益和社会主义建设的需要，而且也为资产阶级代表人物所接受，最后也为人数众多的资本家所欢迎。从绝大多数资本家的情况来看，由于社会主义经济的发展，农业社会主义改造飞跃的前进以及私营企业工人店员群众的积极督促，党对资产阶级分子经过团结和斗争，耐心教育和人事安排以及在清产估价核资定息等方面的从宽照顾，促进他们日益觉悟起来，使它们逐步地了解到在中国确实不可能走资本主义的道路，而走社会主义的道路是唯一的出路。同时也由于从他们的亲身经历中，逐步地认识到他们自己的前途是和祖国的繁荣富强分不开的。在和平改造资本主义的过程中最生动地说明了社会主义制度大大地优越于资本主义的制度。同时，我国对资本主义所采取的和平改造的方案，又是确实入情入理，为绝大多数资本家所能接受的。即令在将来资本主义所有制完全被消灭了，他们的工作和生活也是有保障的，所以放弃抵抗接受社会主义改造，对他们自己和他们的后代也都有好处。经验证明，取得了国家政权的工人阶级要实行对资本主义的社会主义改造采取和平的方法，在领导上就要有高度的原则性和灵活性，要坚持有团结有斗争的统一战线的方针政策，并采取结合实际斗争的说服教育的方法，巩固和提高拥护社会主义的进步分子，争取中间分子、落后分子逐步地转向进步分子看齐，分化顽固分子，以团结多数，削弱反抗，便于进行社会主义的改造。在这里，既要反对在对资本主义和平改造过程中的左倾空谈，又要反对无原则的妥协的右倾保守，既要维护工人阶级的长远利益，又要有为绝大多数的资产阶级分子所能接受的方案。只要有这种非常明确但又是非常坚定的方针政策和具体实施方案，并且能够坚持贯彻奋斗到底，那末，我们就不但可以赢得对资本主义的社会主义改造的决定性的胜利，而且一定可以赢得这一斗争的最后的完全的胜利。
    这里必须指出：这一策略路线方针政策能否贯彻执行，其中心关键，是在于对民族资产阶级的两面性要有正确的分析和全面的认识，才能保证在决定党的策略路线方针政策时不犯错误，而且能够在实际工作中得到正确的执行。相反的，如果对民族资产阶级采取一种主观主义的方法，主要是教条主义的方法，这就是否认资产阶级积极性的一面，夸大消极性的一面，和党的策略路线方针政策相对立。这种错误如果不及时发现，加以纠正，就会造成工作上不应有的损失。这是一种“左”的机会主义的倾向。同时，在对资本主义改造过程中也发生过右的机会主义的倾向，这是只看到资产阶级积极性的一面，忽视了资产阶级消极性的一面，因而对资产阶级麻痹迁就和退让，也会使我们的工作受到一定的损失。这两种错误倾向都有思想的、历史的、社会的根源。党的六届七中全会的决议和不久以前人民日报发表的“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”一文中，都已经很明确地指出了教条主义的危害性。1935年遵义会议后，结束了第二次国内革命战争时期三次左倾机会主义路线，教条主义在党内已经不占统治地位，以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会的马克思列宁主义的领导，领导着全党。1942年延安和各抗日革命根据地的整风运动，使全党干部和广大群众有所警惕，使党能够依靠群众，因而发挥了广大人民群众的积极性和创造性，赢得了人民民主革命的胜利，并进而向社会主义革命胜利前进，取得了社会主义革命决定性的胜利。我国在对资本主义的和平改造过程中，经常要注意克服教条主义倾向，如果没有克服教条主义倾向的斗争，在某些方面也会发生障碍的。“左”倾是由于所谓孤立中间势力的理论而来的机械搬运，这就是人所共知的从“左”边来的一种教条主义。同样，右倾是放弃工人阶级领导权，对资产阶级作无原则的妥协，这是来自第二国际所吹嘘的机会主义“理论”。因此，我们的头脑必须清醒，要经常保持高度的警惕性，这不只是对于实际工作者是很重要的，而对于理论工作者，应当说更为重要。一切从事实际工作和理论研究的人，都应当遵照党和毛泽东同志的指示，时常警惕着教条主义的危害性，认真做到理论和实际密切结合，把研究马克思列宁主义与贯彻实施党的策略、路线、方针、政策有机地联系起来，为迎接社会主义革命的新的胜利而斗争。
      （2）我国对资本主义的和平改造所进行的斗争，是创造性地运用了马克思列宁主义关于和平转变的学说，关于赎买政策以及列宁关于国家资本主义的学说，加以具体化，使得这些理论政策，在中国具体条件下得到极为完满的实现。
    国家资本主义不是一种独立的经济形态，它的性质、作用和服务的目的，依社会制度和国家的性质为转移。在资本主义社会制度下，国家政权操纵在资产阶级手里，国家资本主义就是资本主义的一种形式，是资本主义性质的经济，为资产阶级的利益服务，以便于资产阶级反对无产阶级。在新的社会制度下，在无产阶级专政的国家里，国家资本主义经济则是另外一回事。这两种国家资本主义的性质和界限必须分清，否则容易使思想混乱，立场不稳，对于党的正确的策略路线方针政策发生动摇和偏差。国家资本主义在我国也是一种过渡性质的经济形式，即在从资本主义向社会主义过渡的时期，使资本主义经济成分改造为社会主义的经济成分；它不是一种普通意义下的资本主义，它是受工人阶级国家领导、工人群众监督和以各种方式与社会主义国营经济发生联系和合作的资本主义，是“我们能够加以限制，我们能够规定它的界限的一种资本主义”
  （列宁），是服务于工人阶级利益，用来逐渐改变资本主义私有制为社会主义全民所有制的经济形式。通过它对资本主义所有制加以逐渐改变，达到消灭资产阶级的目的。
    国家资本主义是进到社会主义的门阶，为企业国有化创造有利的条件。因此，对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的步骤就是：第一步鼓励和指导资本主义工商业转变为各种不同形式的国家资本主义经济，一直到全行业的公私合营；第二步把全行业合营的国家资本主义经济转变为社会主义经济，以全民所有制代替资本家所有制。在这两个步骤之间是没有中间阶段的。国家资本主义经济是企业国有化的必要准备，企业国有化是国家资本主义经济发展的必然结果。
    但是，我国资本主义的发展有其本身的过程，由低级形式到高级形式的发展就是这一过程的规律性。而形式的多样化，又是我国国家资本主义发展的特点。国家资本主义由低级形式到高级形式的发展过程，就是国家行政管理、国营经济领导和工人群众监督逐步加强的过程，也就是社会主义经济成分和资本主义经济成分的经济联盟以及社会主义因素由外部到内部逐步加深和增长的过程，随着这种进程的变化，资本主义企业内部的经营方法和生产关系也就逐步地发生变化。
    国家资本主义由低级形式到高级形式的发展，以及在某一个时期某一个阶段，以哪种形式作为国家资本主义发展的主要的或基本的形式为最适当，决定于下列几个条件：
    ①决定于社会生产力的发展水平。社会生产力每提高一步，也就要求国家资本主义的形式得到相应的提高，即以一种形式代替另一种形式。过去以某一种形式为主要的形式或基本的形式还是最适当的，能够解决当时客观经济生活所提出的要求，但是，在生产力进一步发展的条件下，在国家工业化和农业合作化已出现了新的情况之后，那么，那种最适当的形式就显出陈旧落后了，甚至成为生产力进一步发展的严重障碍，不得不以另一种形式即较高级的形式来代替，当时不但是国家资本主义的中级形式的加工定货要向高级形式的公私合营转化或上升，而且普遍要求一跃而上升前进到全行业的公私合营，这就是社会经济规律发展所要求的。因为，国家资本主义的每一种形式都反映着一定的生产关系，形式的改变就是生产关系的发展。否则生产关系仍然不能适合生产力性质的要求，也会影响到资本主义进一步的改造。同时国营经济领导力量的不断增长，对国家资本主义由低级形式到高级形式的发展起着极其重要的推动作用。当国营经济力量还不十分强大，领导地位还不十分巩固的时候，资本家很难接受国家资本主义的高级形式，甚至采取抗拒的态度，而且实际的经济生活也不可能要求国家资本主义一开始就以最高的形式出现。可是，当国营经济力量已经壮大，领导地位已经巩固的时候，国家资本主义再停留在低级形式的阶段，就会出现极不相称的情况，也会影响国营经济进一步的发展和对资本主义进一步的改造。
    当国家进入第一个五年建设计划阶段以后，资本主义的企业，迅速地由国家资本主义的初级、中级形式向高级形式过渡，由资本主义企业的外部深入到资本主义企业的内部实行社会主义的改造，乃是这一形式发展变化和前进的内在的必然的规律性。
    ②国民经济计划化的逐步加强也要求国家资本主义从低级形式向高级形式发展。由于资产阶级唯利是图的本质，对于提高产品质量降低成本是漠不关心的，资本主义的企业缺乏计划性和生产的无政府状态，这和国民经济的计划化完全处于相对立的地位，不利于国民经济的发展。把资本主义工商业转变为各种不同形式的国家资本主义经济之后，即在不同程度上纳入了国家计划的轨道。国家资本主义从低级形式到高级形式的发展，也是和国民经济计划化逐步相适应的过程。
    ③党和国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造所采取的重大措施，是促进国家资本主义由低级形式到高级形式发展的重要条件之一，是以这一种形式代替那一种形式所不可缺少的因素。因为党和国家所采取的经济措施是自觉地运用客观经济规律的结果，这些措施的实行，给国家资本主义的发展开辟了前进的道路，使社会主义基本经济规律对资本主义企业的影响加强，从而促进国家资本主义由低级形式到高级形式的发展。
    上述三个条件，对认识国家资本主义为什么必然从低级形式向高级形式发展，为什么有这样多的形式变化以及为什么在一定时期一定阶段上只能以这种形式而不能以那种形式作为国家资本主义发展的主要或基本的形式的道理，是会有帮助的。任何企图离开这些条件，孤立地来谈国家资本主义形式的变化和发展，都是不可理解的。而且，国家资本主义形式由低级到高级的发展变化，正是说明党和国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作逐步地深入，资本主义生产关系逐步地发生变化。没有国家资本主义这种过渡的经济形式，没有国家资本主义从低级形式到高级形式的发展变化，就谈不到对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造。
    在资本主义工商业的社会主义改造事业中，国家资本主义的形式共分三种：即低级形式、中级形式和高级形式。但由于工业和商业有区别，国家资本主义各种形式的内容也就有所差异。在工业中，国家资本主义的形式是：低级形式为收购，中级形式为加工订货统购包销，高级形式是个别公私合营和全行业公私合营。在商业中，国家资本主义的形式是：低级形式的为批购零销；中级形式为经销代销；高级形式是个别公私合营和全行业公私合营。
    整个国家资本主义是由低级到高级发展，它的形式和步骤多样化，方法是渐进的，逐步占领阵地，稳步前进。但这些改造资本主义过渡的形式是很灵活的，有一些不一定刻板地经过国家资本主义由低级到高级逐步上升的形式，有一些也可以越过国家资本主义阶段直接向国有化过渡。但不管怎样过渡，必须注意以下两个问题：①对原来企业的人事和资金必须作妥善的安排；②只有在必要和条件具备时才能采取越级过渡的办法，平时一般仍是采取三级逐步上升的过渡形式。
    中级形式的加工订货，是使资本主义生产纳入国家计划的起点，同时又直接为高级形式的公私合营准备了条件，所以加工订货在对资本主义工业进行和平改造中，起了巨大的桥梁作用和积极作用。这表现在以下几个方面：
    ①通过加工订货，原料的采购和产品的销售被卡住，割断了资本家和市场的联系，在生产上他要保证数量、质量、规格和按时完成订货任务，初步地将资本主义企业纳入国家计划的轨道。
    ②通过加工订货，密切了同一行业及行业之间的生产联系，使资本主义工业可由分散走向集中，公开了技术，交流了经验，也适当地促进了经营管理方法的改进，为公私合营创造了条件。
    ③通过加工订货，计算工资工时和管理费用作为工缴费，适当地降低了成本价格，限制了资本家的利润。
    ④通过加工订货，鼓励了资产阶级积极性的一面，打击了他们抗拒改造和违法的一面。
    正因为加工订货有这种桥梁作用和积极作用，就经常和资本家进行自产自销、自由市场和自由价格发生斗争。凭借这个中级形式斗争的开展，逐步克服资产阶级的抵抗，然后就可以进一步引导资本家继续向公私合营前进，不能停留在加工订货这一形式上，因为这个形式有漏洞，资本家是愿意停留在加工订货阶段上的。加工订货使资本家可以拿加工费（或叫工缴费），资本家的利润是按照加工费来提成的，因而资本家不愿降低加工成本费，不肯节约材料，为了提高他的利润额，反而用水涨船高的办法，提高加工成本费，有的谎报成本，有的给职工滥加工资，或建立不合理的奖励制度，自己也乘机捞一把。在经营管理方法上不能进行有效的改革，机构庞杂，人浮于事，财务混乱，生产没有规划，浪费现象严重，以致成本高，产品质量低。所以加工订货长期存在下去，生产力不可能得到进一步的解放和发展。
    由代购包销进入加工订货，然后由加工订货过渡到公私合营，再由全行业的公私合营过渡到国有化，是一系列很正常很健全的过渡形式和方法。
    我们是把资本主义的社会主义改造分为两个阶段，第一个阶段经过国家资本主义的由低级到高级三种形式的发展，然后转到第二阶段进入完全的社会主义，即国有化的阶段。决定斗争胜负的关键，主要是在第一个阶段，而经过国家资本主义又是进行和平改造的一种比较健全的斗争形式和组织形式。
      （3）掌握了政权的工人阶级，能不能够稳固地掌握住经济领导权，是关系革命斗争的成败问题。帝国主义曾经指望我们要向他们乞讨或依赖他们才能生活下去。资产阶级也曾经估计我们是不会搞经济工作或进行经济斗争的。他们对我们在经济战线上的领导作用，却是有过怀疑的。自然，起初我国工人阶级在这一方面的本领不很高明，也是事实，但用马克思列宁主义武装起来的工人阶级和它的政党——共产党有光荣的战斗传统，就是不断地在工作中斗争中学习，去提高自己的本领，以及教育别人。开国之初，党鉴于历史的教训和社会主义经济建设任务的重要性，除加强国营经济与合作社经济的领导外，强调在对资本主义的和平改造中把发展生产放在第一位，使发展生产和资本主义的社会主义改造密切结合起来，反对互相对立的看法和作法。因此，我国在对资本主义和平改造第一阶段中的各种形式的斗争，都没有离开发展生产这一中心环节。凡是与此相反的做法都会受到损失和挫折。甚至在“三反”“五反”最紧张的斗争时期，也还是斗争和生产两不误。资本主义工商业公私合营高潮到来时，全国也都是展开了合营生产两不误的斗争。因此，善于抓紧生产这一环节，善于把生产和其他的斗争结合起来，这就是社会主义战无不胜攻无不克的基本原因之一。
    在开国之初，党号召私营企业的职工群众帮助资本家克服困难维持生产，而要搞好生产，必须保持商品和货币流通的正常化，保持市场金融物价的稳定。正如前面所说过的，不少资本家对生产消极而热中于投机倒把。这时党发动了反对投机倒把和稳定市场金融物价的斗争。这两方面斗争胜利的结果，使当时的资本主义经济由恢复而转向发展。今年二月，国务院发出指示，对全行业公私合营后的经济改组（即生产改组）要有准备地慎重地进行，就是要防止因经济改组不慎而影响生产的发展。上海市在全行业公私合营后，首先抓生产经营，迎接完成农业生产所急需完成的双轮双铧犁的巨大任务，然后再搞清产核资。经济改组是按照国务院指示的精神办理的，因而在公私合营的企业里，立即出现了劳动竞赛的生产热潮，也推动了经济改组有准备有秩序地进行。党和国家无论在恢复时期和建设时期总是强调生产第一，并使它和各种斗争密切结合，因为只有这样才能显示社会主义制度的优越性，而使工人阶级自己处于主动的不败的地位。
      （4）取得这一胜利，巩固这一胜利，扩大这一胜利（即对资本主义的双重改造由第一阶段过渡到第二阶段），它的先决条件，它的前提是什么呢？就是中国工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。党用人民民主专政的政权，利用国内外一切有利条件，保证和保卫和平过渡到社会主义，保证和保卫顺利地进行对资本主义的社会主义改造。马克思列宁主义总结世界革命史的经验，告诉我们“政权问题，是任何革命的根本问题”。毛泽东同志在中华人民共和国开国的前夜就教导我们，“人民手里有强大的国家机器，不怕民族资产阶级造反”。因此，在二十世纪的中国，离开无产阶级政权（不论运用什么方法经过什么道路取得政权），就是说，如果无产阶级没有掌握政权，而想和平转变到社会主义，这不能不是一种空想。应当说，“政权问题，是任何革命的根本问题”这一真理在我国社会主义革命的实践中，又一次得到证实。
      （5）我国原来是一个半殖民地半封建的落后的国家，在赢得了人民民主革命胜利之后，立即转入到社会主义的革命，并迅速地由经济恢复时期转入社会主义建设时期。在消灭资本主义所有制和消灭资产阶级的重大原则问题上，采取逐步前进和积极改造的方针和步骤，创造性地运用和发展了马克思列宁主义，因而为在落后的国家中消灭资本主义所有制和消灭资产阶级提供了一个新的典型。这就证明不同的国家由民主革命转变到社会主义革命有着不同的方法形式和道路。十月社会主义革命，是人类历史上第一个社会主义革命，这个革命发生在俄国那样的资本主义发展到帝国主义阶段的国家，由于当时国内国际形势，阶级力量对比和资产阶级态度的不同，因此，在俄国消灭资本主义所有制和消灭资产阶级，提供了第一个社会主义革命的典型。今后在世界革命过程中，具有和我国历史情况不同的国家，对于消灭资本主义所有制和资产阶级，又会提供另外的典型。马克思列宁主义的原则，是要根据具体情况作具体分析，加以灵活地运用。由于各个国家当时的内部情况和国际环境不同，因而在掌握了政权的工人阶级对于从资本主义过渡到社会主义的形式和道路，是不会完全相同的。我国对资本主义的和平改造就是证明了这个真理，因而具有伟大的国际意义。
    我国对资本主义的和平改造的伟大国际意义，还在于实行了双重改造相结合的方法和步骤。一方面是对资本主义企业逐步地进行社会主义的改造，经过各种形式的国家资本主义，最后达到国有化。另一方面，对资产阶级分子逐步地进行社会主义的思想改造，把绝大多数资本家，改造成为自食其力的劳动者。实践证明，在一定的条件下，人的阶级性不是不可能改变的。马克思主义的基本原理是存在决定意识，如果资本主义的企业进入了被逐步改造的过程，也就是资产阶级的经济基础在逐步地解体中，资本家的存在既然要逐步地改变了，因而也就有可能来改变资本家的意识，改变他的阶级性。如果资本家的思想逐步地得到改造，反过来意识又可以影响存在。正因为我们采取双重改造的办法，其结局是经过一定的教育和斗争，资本主义企业和大多数资本家都能达到改造的目的。这样的结局，在历史上是没有先例的，对于工人阶级是最为有利的。当然，这种双重改造的系统的完整的经验，还有待于今后的积累和总结，但是这种企业改造和人的改造相结合的办法，在国际无产阶级斗争的舞台上，确实展开了一个新的序幕。
    我国和平转变到社会主义这一历史事实，具有异常巨大的国际意义，还在于它是在一个六亿人口的大国，永远地脱离了资本主义世界体系，走进了社会主义世界体系，这对保卫亚洲的和平、保卫世界和平、促进人类进步事业，不能不是有决定作用的；这给帝国主义侵略势力的打击，给被压迫民族反殖民主义斗争的鼓舞，使摆脱帝国主义压迫的民族加强建设的信心，都有极为重大的作用。
