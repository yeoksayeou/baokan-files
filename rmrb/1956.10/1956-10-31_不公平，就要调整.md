    Unfairness Requires Adjustment
    Huì zhī
    Agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have encountered many complex problems during the autumn harvest distribution. One of the problems is the unreasonable differences in income among the various production teams within a cooperative. There are many reasons for this unreasonable difference: some agricultural cooperatives did not separately assess indicators based on the soil quality, water conservancy, distance of the land, the cleanliness of wasteland, and the differences in crop types and previous crops when contracting work and output to teams; in some cooperatives, the various conditions of each team were roughly the same, but the contracted work and output quantities differed greatly; as a result, there were significant discrepancies between the contracted output and the actual output, and between the contracted work and the actual labor used. Some cooperatives had unreasonable work quotas, and some cooperatives had varying degrees of stringency in enforcing quotas among the teams; as a result, the labor days earned by members of each team varied greatly. In addition, the level of intensive cultivation and the amount of investment differed among the production teams; as a result, some production teams, although receiving overproduction bonuses, still suffered losses when calculated in terms of costs. In some large, multi-village cooperatives, the economic foundations of each village (or team) differed, and the production conditions varied. Even if there were no problems with contracting work and output or with enforcing quotas, the villages (or teams) with a better original foundation and higher income would still feel disadvantaged.
    In this situation, some dissatisfaction arose among the members. Members of production teams that cultivated carefully and had good harvests said: Our team put in a lot of sweat and effort into applying manure and weeding when cultivating. Other teams sowed carelessly, seldom tilled or weeded, but now we get the same share of grain. Isn't our labor wasted? Members of villages with a good foundation felt they were disadvantaged by the merger and advocated distribution by village. Some members of teams with poor harvests said: The higher stage of socialism is about the good leading the bad, the strong supporting the weak, and the poor villages benefiting from the rich villages.
    Faced with this situation, some cadres developed a fear of difficulty. Some believed: This year we have no experience, and contracting work and output was not done well, so it can be discontinued. Others believed: Advanced cooperatives have a lot of assets and can only be sloppy, and it's difficult to be completely clear. They advocated completely abandoning the original contracting work and output scheme and adopting a method of distribution based on the actual amount of labor used by each team. In a situation where the evaluation standards for work points varied greatly among the teams, doing so was obviously not feasible. For example, in an agricultural cooperative in Matou Town, Tong County, Hebei, the third production team cultivated 1,200 mu of land and used more than 13,000 workdays, while another production team used more than 22,000 workdays to cultivate the same amount of land. This cooperative originally implemented contracting work and output; however, it now ignores the amount of labor used and does not investigate the reasons, but distributes the same nine jiao and three fen per workday to the entire cooperative. How can this be fair? The land is the same between teams, and the amount of labor used differs by almost double. Can there be no problem here? Obviously, this approach obliterates the distinction between advanced and backward, violates the principle of distribution according to labor, and will only make the masses more dissatisfied and the work more difficult in the future.
    In order to encourage and fully mobilize the labor enthusiasm of the masses, contracting work and output that has already been implemented should not be completely abandoned; however, it should also not be rigidly adhered to without any adjustments. Unreasonable contracting work and output plans should be adjusted with reference to the changes in implementation, unfair distribution plans should be revised, and this distribution work should be done conscientiously in accordance with the principle of distribution according to labor. Of course, this does not mean that everything must be done from scratch, re-setting quotas, re-assessing output, and re-calculating costs. That would delay the distribution time. It should be handled separately according to the specific situation. If the contracting work and output are relatively accurate, there are not many problems in implementation, and the differences between teams are not large, the distribution can be basically based on the original plan without much change. If the contracting work and output are not accurate, or there are differences in implementation among the teams, appropriate adjustments should be made. If the contracted output is too high and most teams cannot reach the target, the target can be lowered to avoid discouragement and loss of confidence among the teams. If the contracted output target is basically accurate for most teams, and only individual teams are not accurate or cannot reach the target due to objective reasons such as natural disasters, adjustments should be made individually according to the actual situation. If, after detailed investigation and mass evaluation, it is indeed the case that the team's subjective efforts were insufficient and production decreased, no adjustments should be made. If both subjective and objective reasons exist, appropriate adjustments can also be made. The same applies to contracting work. If the contracted work is not accurate or the number of workdays has increased or decreased due to changes in objective circumstances, the cooperative should evaluate and adjust it uniformly; if everyone believes that the original contracted work is reasonable, but the teams have varying degrees of stringency in assigning work points to the members, the distribution should be based on the original contracted work to each team without changes.
    As for cooperatives without contracting work and output, as long as the actual output and the actual amount of labor used are checked, if the differences between the teams are not large, the distribution can be carried out. If there are large discrepancies, a representative team can be selected, and through democratic consultation, the teams that have been too strict in controlling work points and have recorded fewer workdays should have their work points appropriately increased, and the teams that have been too lenient in controlling work points and have recorded more workdays should have their work points appropriately reduced, so as to achieve a general balance.
    Cooperatives without contracting work and output can also try out overproduction rewards. This can also be implemented in cooperatives where production has increased significantly and many teams have exceeded the cooperative's planned output, or where production has decreased significantly and many teams have failed to reach the cooperative's planned output. In these cooperatives, there are always differences in the achievements of each production team; if these differences are not distinguished, it will not be possible to encourage increased production and educate the members.
    Appropriate consideration should be given to villages or teams with a better foundation, so that the rate of increase in income of each team is roughly balanced. In normal years, at least it should be ensured that the villages or teams with a better original foundation do not have a lower income than in the past. How to take care of them? Here is an example. The Shengli Agricultural Cooperative in Tunliu County, Shanxi, is composed of six villages, with a large difference in economic foundation. The average net income per person in Miao'erjiao Village last year was more than fifty-seven yuan, while the average net income per person in Dongcun Village, the village with the worst foundation, was only thirty-one yuan, a difference of more than twenty-six yuan. Calculated on this basis, the increase in income in Dongcun Village this year would be about twice as high as that in Miao'erjiao Village, which is detrimental to the unity of the entire cooperative. However, the Shengli Cooperative handled this problem well. In addition to paying attention to giving play to the favorable conditions of the villages with a better foundation early on, allowing them to do more labor days and engage in more household sideline occupations, they also extracted a portion of cash from the total income during distribution after democratic discussion to take care of Miao'erjiao, so that the proportion of income increase in each village was basically balanced. Due to the implementation of the mutually beneficial policy, this cooperative is more united and consolidated than before. Such care is absolutely necessary and is aimed at the long-term interests of all members. Because each village has its own potential and its own favorable conditions, which cannot be fully exploited when operating separately. Only by uniting can they learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, develop production more comprehensively, and promote the common improvement of each village.
    As long as it is unfair, it should be adjusted, and there should be no fear of trouble. Adjusting the unreasonable differences in income between teams can not only make this year's distribution work fair and reasonable, but also draw lessons from it and lay the foundation for doing a good job in the coming year. Avoiding this problem and attempting to deal with it with a simplistic approach will only bring more trouble.

    不公平，就要调整
    慧之
    各地农业生产合作社在秋收分配中遇到了不少比较复杂的问题。一个社里各个生产队的收益的不合理的差异就是问题之一。产生这种不合理的差异的原因很多：有的农业社在包工包产的时候没有根据各个队的土质、水利、地的远近、荒净和作物种类和前茬作物的不同等情况，分别评定指标；有的社各个队各种条件大体相同，而包工包产数量却相差很远；结果，各队承包的产量同实产量、包工数同实际用工数相差悬殊。有的社工作定额不合理，有的社各队执行定额时有松有紧；结果，各队社员所得到的劳动日相差很多。此外，各生产队耕作精细程度、投资数量不同，结果，有些生产队虽然得到了超产奖励，按成本计算却还是吃亏。一些大型的联村社，各村（或队）经济基础不同，生产条件各异，即使包工包产、执行定额都没问题，原来基础较好收入较高的村
  （或队）还会感到吃亏。
    在这情况下，社员中产生了一些不满情绪。耕作细致收成好的生产队的社员说：我们队耕种时一点汗一点血地送粪除草，别的队白茬下种，少锄懒薅，现在一样分粮，我们的劳动不是白费了吗？基础好的村的社员觉得并社吃了亏，主张按村分配。收成差的队有的社员说：社会主义高级化，就是要好的带动差的，强的扶持弱的，穷村就得沾富村点光。
    面对这种情况，有些干部产生了畏难的情绪。有人认为：今年没经验，包工包产没搞好，可以不执行了。有人认为：高级社家当大，只能马马虎虎，很难弄个清清白白。他们主张完全丢开原来的包工包产方案，采用按各队实际用工数目分配的方法。在各队评工标准很不一致的情况下，这样做显然是不行的。例如河北通县马头镇有一个农业社，第三生产队种地一千二百亩，用工一万三千多个，另一个生产队种同样多的地却用了二万二千多个工。这个社原来是实行包工包产的；现在却不管用工多少，也不查明原因何在，全社一律按每个劳动日九角三分来分配。这怎么能公平呢？队与队之间土地相同，用工数几乎差了一倍，这里能没有问题吗？很明显，这样做法抹煞了先进和落后的区别，违反了按劳取酬的原则，只会使群众更加不满，今后工作更加困难。
    为了鼓舞和充分发挥群众的劳动积极性，已经实行包工包产的不应该完全放弃；但是，也不应该死抱着原定的指标一点也不许动。应该参照执行中的变化情况，调整不合理的包工包产计划，修正不公平的分配方案，按照按劳取酬的原则，切实做好这次分配工作。当然这也不是说一切都得从头做起，再定定额，再评产量，再算成本。那样便会拖延分配时间。应当根据具体情况，分别处理。包工包产比较准确，执行中也没多大问题，队和队差异不大的，可以基本不动按原计划分配。包工包产包得不准确，或各队执行中有差异的，就应该适当调整。包产过高，各队普遍达不到指标的，可以降低指标，免得各队都心灰意懒，失去信心。如果多数队包产指标基本准确，只有个别队包得不准或因自然灾害等客观原因影响而不能达到指标的，应根据实际情况个别调整。如果经过详细调查，群众评议确系因为这个队主观努力不够而减产的，就不调整。如果主观客观原因都有，也可以适当调整。包工也是这样，包得不准或因客观情况变化而增加或减少用工数的，应由社内统一评议调整；如果大家认为原包工数合理，只是各队在给社员评分中有松有紧，就应按原包工数分配给各队，不必更动。
    至于没有包工包产的社，只要检查一下实际产量和实际用工数，如果各队出入不大，即可进行分配。如有悬殊，可以选出一个有代表性的队，通过民主协商，对工分掌握过紧记分少的队，适当增加工数，掌握过松记工多的队，适当减少工数，做到大体平衡。
    没有包工包产的社也可以试行超产奖励。在增产很多队队都超过社里的计划产量的社里，或减产很多队队都达不到社里的计划产量的社里，也同样可以实行。在这些社里，各个生产队的成绩总是有差别的；如果不分青红皂白，便不能起鼓励增产和教育社员的作用。
    对基础较好的村或队应当给以适当照顾，使各队的收益增加的速度大致平衡，在正常年景下，至少也要做到不使原来基础较好的村或队反而比过去减少收入。怎样照顾呢？这里有一个例子。山西屯留县胜利农业社是由六个村组成的，经济基础相差很大。庙儿脚村去年每人平均纯收入五十七元多，基础最差的东村每人才三十一元，相差二十六元多，按照这个基础来计算，今年收益的增加东村比庙儿脚要高两倍左右，这对全社的团结是不利的。但是胜利社对这个问题处理得较好，他们除平时及早注意发挥基础较好村的有利条件，让他们多做劳动日多搞家庭副业外，分配时又经民主讨论从总收入中抽出一部分现款对庙儿脚进行照顾，使各村增加收入比例基本平衡。由于互利政策的贯彻，这个社比以前更加团结和巩固。这样的照顾是完全必要的，是从全体社员的长远利益着眼的。因为各村有各村的潜力，各村有各村的有利条件，分散经营时都不能充分发挥，只有联合起来才能取长补短，更全面发展生产，促使各村共同提高。
    只要不公平，就应该调整，不应该怕麻烦。调整队与队之间的收益的不合理的差异，不仅能使今年的分配工作做到公平合理，还可以从中吸取经验教训，为做好下一年的工作打下基础。回避这个问题而企图用简单化的办法来处理它，只可能带来更多的麻烦。
