    Two Little Lives in Lu Xun's Novels
    Xu Gan
    Gui Youguang's "A Brief Account of My Late Mother's Deeds" records his mother's death due to a pair of snails, which has recently become well-known due to the tadpole contraception theory. This is an excellent start. I remember my fellow villagers in the past who ate dead infants, who ate the placenta, and even several elderly people who ate meat cut from their sons' and daughters-in-law's bodies, but none of their illnesses were cured. I also personally witnessed my mother swallowing live geckos wrapped in vegetable leaves. She died not long after. It cannot be said that she died from swallowing geckos, but it is undoubtedly true that the geckos did not cure her illness. The person who contributed this prescription was neither an old woman nor a person skilled in magic arts, but Yan Huafeng, a pediatrician famous in the four rural areas of Shaoxing thirty to fifty years ago. The patient was his daughter, my maternal grandmother, and his motivation was naturally good. He and the aforementioned He Lianchen were sworn brothers, and both were high-achieving students taught by a famous teacher, so using strange things as medicinal primers was the same. This gives me a deeper understanding of the several works in which Mr. Lu Xun wrote about traditional Chinese medicine.
    I would never dare to completely negate traditional Chinese medicine from decades ago, let alone disturb the spirit of my maternal grandfather, who lived to be over a hundred years old before passing away. Because I still very much respect this old man's personality of not considering wealth or poverty when practicing medicine, providing diagnoses and dispensing medicine, and the ancient chivalrous spirit of carrying a large string of small silver knives with him and treating sores and poisonings for children in the countryside along the way. And there are many traditional Chinese medicine practitioners who possess this virtue. In addition, from the time I grew a full set of milk teeth as a child until I contracted a scarlet fever that almost killed me at the age of sixteen, all my illnesses were handled by him alone; although he gave me a lot of antelope horn to reduce the fever that time, and he asserted that I would not be able to have sons and daughters after marriage, and I now have children in abundance, I still do not doubt his medical skills.
    However, to be honest, since I understood some common sense of natural science, I have not dared to consult traditional Chinese medicine for a long time. Only like now, seeing traditional Chinese medicine advancing towards science on the basis of the nation's medical theories and pharmacology, do I dare to consult traditional Chinese medicine again with peace of mind. And Mr. Lu Xun, who was in an era when traditional Chinese medicine was completely stagnant and some traditional Chinese medicine practitioners degraded themselves into practitioners of magic arts full of Jianghu [江湖 - literally rivers and lakes, referring to the wandering martial arts world] atmosphere, suffered the pain of his father's death and his younger brother's early death, and witnessed the lives of the poor being as worthless as grass, was fully justified in his indignation. He once aspired to study medicine precisely for this reason, and that feeling is also completely understandable.

    鲁迅小说里的两条小命
    徐淦
    归有光“先妣事略”记他的母亲死于一对田螺，最近因蝌蚪避孕论而颇为人所知，这是极好的开端。我记得我的乡亲们，过去有吃过死婴的，有吃过胞衣的，至于吃儿子、儿媳身上割下来的肉的老人，更有好几位，但他们的病都没有好。我还亲眼看见我的母亲吞吃菜叶裹活壁虎，她不久也死了，不能说就死于吞吃壁虎，但壁虎没有治好她的病总是无疑的。贡献这个单方的，一非老妪，二非方技之士，却是三五十年前闻名绍兴四乡的儿科严华峰，我的外祖父，病人是他的女儿，他的动机自然是好的。他和上面所说的何廉臣是襟兄襟弟，两个人又是一位名师传授出来的高徒，所以用奇奇怪怪的东西做药引也一样，这使我对鲁迅先生写到中医的几篇作品，更有深刻的体会。
    我决不敢把几十年前的中医全盘否定，更不想惊动我那位活到一百另几岁才逝世的外祖父的在天之灵。因为我还十分尊重这位老人行医时贫富不计、送诊施药的人格，和那种随身带一大串小银刀、沿路给乡下儿童治疮毒的古道热肠。而具有这种美德的中医是很多的。此外，我从小时候换满咀乳牙起，直到十六岁染一场险些死掉的猩红热，凡病都是他老人家一手包办；尽管那次他给我吃了许多羚羊角退热，他断言我结了婚将不能生男育女，而我现在儿女成群了，我对他的医道还是并不怀疑的。
    但是，说句老实话，自从我懂得一些自然科学的常识，我很久不敢请教中医了，只有像现在这样，见中医在接受民族的医理药理的根基上向科学进军，我才又敢放心去请教中医。而处在中医完全故步自封、和一部分中医自贬为江湖气十足的方技之士那个时代的鲁迅先生，身受父死弟夭之痛，目击穷人的性命更如草芥，是完全有理由愤慨的。他一度发奋学医，正是为此，那心情也完全可以理解。
