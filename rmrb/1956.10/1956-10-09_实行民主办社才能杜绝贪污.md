Title: Implementing Democratic Cooperative Management is the Only Way to Eliminate Corruption

Currently, in some agricultural production cooperatives, there is still a significant loophole: some cadres, taking advantage of their positions, engage in various forms of corruption and theft, encroaching on public property.

According to an inspection by the Liaoyang Local Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Liaoning Province in Yingkou County, out of forty-five agricultural cooperatives in the county's water source area, twenty-three were found to have corruption. Furthermore, a preliminary inspection of 238 large cooperatives in Yuyao County, Zhejiang, confirmed that cadres in 21 cooperatives had engaged in varying degrees of corruption. Particularly egregious is that some cooperative cadres even embezzled state-supported cooperative funds intended for poor farmers.

In some agricultural production cooperatives in other areas, varying degrees of corruption and theft also exist.

Why do these phenomena occur? The main reason is the failure to earnestly implement democratic cooperative management. At the beginning of the establishment of cooperatives, many cooperative cadres were appointed by the leadership, and elections were merely a "formality." Therefore, people of poor character were able to become cooperative cadres. After the establishment of the cooperatives, the constant and systematic ideological education of cadres in integrity, devotion to public service, and taking the cooperative as their home was neglected. In addition, the democratic management system was not earnestly implemented, and members were not mobilized to supervise. Even if members exposed wrongdoing, no serious action was taken. The supervisory committees were even like "deaf men's ears," playing no role. As a result, cases of corruption and theft increased. For example, the Shuocun branch of Luan County, Shanxi, had long discovered that Cui Mantang, the deputy accountant of the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative, former accountant Cui Guobao, and deputy director Li Youbao were engaging in corruption, but the leadership did not investigate or hold them accountable. When members raised this issue, former branch secretary Li Jinshan not only completely denied it but also openly rebuked the members, scaring them from expressing their opinions again. As a result, the corrupt behavior of Cui Mantang and others was encouraged, and it was not until they had embezzled and stolen more than 1,200 yuan that action had to be taken.

In these agricultural cooperatives, the behavior of some cadres in embezzling and stealing the public property of the cooperatives has already aroused the dissatisfaction of the members. Some members said: "We work hard and produce things, but they are embezzled and stolen. What's the point of being enthusiastic?" Some members said: "The income of advanced agricultural cooperatives is high, but the distribution is low!" Still other members said: "Working is very energetic, but when I think of the accounts, my hands and feet go weak." As a result, some cooperative members refuse to work, demand to withdraw from the cooperative, and even want to move away.

Clearly, if this loophole is not quickly closed, there will be a lack of guarantee for members to increase their income, and the consolidation and development of the cooperative will be seriously affected. How can this loophole be closed? The county party committees and rural branches must further strengthen their leadership and supervision of agricultural cooperatives and pay attention to constantly educating agricultural cooperative cadres on cherishing public property and being honest and devoted to public service. Within the cooperative, a democratic management system must be established or improved, and members must be mobilized to be masters of their own affairs, discuss and formulate various systems (especially financial management systems), and supervise their implementation. At the same time, the cadres of the cooperative's supervisory committee must be educated to break through personal considerations and vigorously assist the work of the supervisory committee, so that this institution can truly play a supervisory role. As for those cadres who embezzle and steal public property, in addition to making them compensate for the losses of the cooperative, they must also be criticized and educated. Those with extremely bad character and serious corruption should be resolutely removed from their positions and punished according to law, and this should be used as an example to conduct discussions among cadres and members to educate everyone.

    实行民主办社才能杜绝贪污
　　裴国勋
    目前在一些农业生产合作社里，仍然有一个很大的漏洞——部分干部利用职权，采取各种方式，进行贪污盗窃，侵占公共财产。
    据中共辽宁省辽阳地方监察委员会在营口县检查，这个县水源区共有四十五个农业社，其中就发现二十三个社有贪污现象。另据浙江余姚县在二百三十八个大社中的初步检查，已证实有二十一个社的干部有不同程度的贪污行为。尤其恶劣的是：有些社干部竟把国家支援贫农的合作基金贷款也贪污了。
    在别的地方的一些农业生产合作社里，也存在着程度不同的贪污盗窃现象。
    为什么会发生这些现象呢？主要原因是没有认真实行民主办社。在合作社建立之初，有不少社干部是领导方面指定的，选举只是“走过场”。因此，使那些品质不好的人能够当上合作社的干部；而在合作社建立以后，又忽视了对干部进行经常的、系统的廉洁奉公、以社为家的思想教育；再加上没有认真执行民主管理制度，没有发动社员监督，即使社员揭发出来，也不进行严肃处理；监察委员会更是“聋子的耳朵”，不起作用。这样，贪污盗窃的事情也就多起来了。像山西潞安县朔村支部，早已发现红星农业社副会计崔满堂、前任会计崔国保、副主任李有保有贪污行为，领导方面却没有过问和追究。当社员提出这个问题的时候，前任支部书记李金山不但完全否认，而且公开斥责社员，吓得社员再也不敢提意见了。结果是助长了崔满堂等人的贪污行为，一直发展到贪污盗窃一千二百多元时，才不得不作处理。
    在这些农业社里，一些干部贪污盗窃合作社的公共财产的行为，已经引起了社员们的不满。有的社员说：“我们劳动出力，生产出来的东西被人贪污盗窃，再积极有什么用？”有的社员说：“高级农业社收入是多，可是就是分的少！”还有的社员说：“干活挺有劲，一想到账，手脚都软了。”有些合作社的社员因此不出工，闹退社，甚至要搬家。
    显然，这个漏洞如果不赶快堵死，社员增加收入就缺乏一定的保证，合作社的巩固和发展也将受到严重的影响。怎样堵死这个漏洞呢？县委和农村支部必须进一步加强对农业社的领导和监督，注意经常地对农业社干部进行爱护公共财产、廉洁奉公的教育；在合作社内要建立或健全民主管理制度，发动社员起来当家作主，讨论制定各项制度（特别是财务管理制度），并监督执行，同时，还要教育社的监察委员会的干部打破情面，对监察委员会的工作予以大力协助，使这个机构能真正起到监察的作用。至于对那些贪污盗窃公共财产的干部，除让他们赔偿社内损失外，还要进行批评和教育；品质极端恶劣、贪污情节较重的，要坚决撤销他们的职务，依法制裁，并且把这作为事例，在干部和社员中展开讨论，教育大家。
