Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 30th: The Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, U Nu, said in Tianjin today: "Building a Sino-Burmese friendship mansion is not difficult, because the people of China and Burma share common thoughts and feelings. I firmly believe that as long as the Five Principles are deeply implemented among the masses, our difficulties will certainly be overcome."
    Chairman U Nu made these remarks at a banquet held by Huang Huoqing, Mayor of Tianjin and First Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, to welcome him. He also said: "Every time I come to China, I feel particularly happy because the Chinese people treat me as a relative. In Burma, only overseas Chinese can be called 'Pauk Phaw' (meaning compatriots), which shows how close the people of China and Burma are!"
    Chairman U Nu and his entourage arrived in Tianjin by train from Beijing at 11:18 this morning, accompanied by Yao Zhongming, the Chinese Ambassador to Burma, and Wang Yutian, Deputy Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
    Chairman U Nu and his entourage visited Tianjin New Port. In the evening, Chairman U Nu attended a welcome banquet hosted by Huang Huoqing.

    吴努主席到天津参观
    据新华社天津30日电　缅甸联邦反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努今天在天津说：建立中缅友好大厦不是困难的，因为中缅两国人民有着共同的思想情绪。我深信，只要把五项原则深入地贯彻到群众中去，我们的困难是一定会被克服的。
    吴努主席是在天津市市长、中国共产党天津市委员会第一书记黄火青为欢迎他而举行的晚宴上说这番话的。他还说：我每次到中国来都感到特别高兴，因为中国人民把我当亲戚来接待。在缅甸，只有华侨能被我们称作“抱胞”（同胞之意），由此可见中缅两国人民是多么亲切！
    吴努主席和他的随行人员，是在中国驻缅甸大使姚仲明和外交部礼宾司副司长王雨田的陪同下，在今天上午十一时十八分乘火车由北京到达天津的。
    吴努主席和他的随行人员参观了天津新港。晚间，吴努主席出席了黄火青举行的欢迎宴会。
