Xinhua News Agency, October 21st. Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, today issued a written statement regarding the Kuomintang special agents creating a major riot in Kowloon.

Xu Deheng said that, under the shelter and connivance of the British authorities in Hong Kong, Kuomintang special agents recently created a shocking riot in Kowloon, causing serious damage to the lives and property of our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. This heinous crime has aroused the immense anger of our 600 million people nationwide and has also drawn the righteous condemnation of fair-minded people around the world. We firmly support the solemn protest lodged by Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council to the British government, and the British government must make a satisfactory response to the protest and demands of our government.

Xu Deheng said that after the Kowloon riots occurred, the British authorities in Hong Kong not only failed to take measures to promptly stop them, but also distorted the facts, reversed right and wrong, and attempted to shirk their due responsibility and exonerate the Kuomintang special agents. This kind of act of helping the evildoer is absolutely intolerable.

We express our deep concern and sympathy to the compatriots, teachers, and students in Hong Kong and Kowloon who have been killed and threatened by Kuomintang special agents. All of us Chinese people must be a hundred times more vigilant, and we must liberate Taiwan. The British government should quickly change its unfriendly attitude towards the Chinese people and instruct the British authorities in Hong Kong to immediately take effective measures to arrest Kuomintang special agents and ensure the safety of life and property of Chinese residents in Hong Kong.

    就国民党特务在九龙制造暴乱
    九三学社主席许德珩发表谈话
    新华社21日讯　九三学社中央委员会主席许德珩今天就国民党特务在九龙制造大暴乱事件发表书面谈话。
    许德珩说，国民党特务分子在香港英国当局的包庇和纵容之下，最近在九龙制造了骇人听闻的暴乱事件，使我港九同胞的生命财产受到了严重的损失。这种令人发指的滔天罪行激起了我全国六万万人民的无比愤怒，也引起了全世界公正人士的正义指责。我们坚决拥护国务院周恩来总理对英国政府所提出的严正抗议，英国政府对我国政府的抗议和要求必须作出满意的答复。
    许德珩说，香港英国当局于九龙暴乱事件发生后，不但不采取措施来及时加以制止，反而歪曲事实，颠倒是非，企图推卸自己应负的责任，并为国民党特务分子开脱罪责。这种为虎作伥的作法，是令人绝对不能容忍的。
    我们对于这次遭到国民党特务分子杀害和威胁的港九同胞们和教师们、学生们表示深切的关怀和慰问。我们全中国人民必须百倍地提高警惕，我们一定要解放台湾。英国政府应当迅速改变对中国人民的不友善的态度，责成香港英国当局立刻采取有效措施，逮捕国民党特务分子，保障香港中国居民生命财产的安全。
