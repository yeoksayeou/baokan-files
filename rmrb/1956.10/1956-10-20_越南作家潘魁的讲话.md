Speech by Vietnamese Writer Phan Khoi

We feel extremely honored to represent the Vietnamese literary and intellectual circles to participate in the 20th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death. Today, not only we, but also the entire literary community in our country commemorate the deceased great Chinese writer with respect and gratitude.

Mr. Lu Xun is not only a great writer of China, but also a great writer of the world. Mr. Lu Xun's literary career has long influenced our country, but this influence has become increasingly widespread after the August Revolution.

After 1928, the Vietnamese literary community learned of Lu Xun's name. At that time, although a few newspaper offices occasionally translated some of Mr. Lu Xun's articles, these articles were not very prominent in order to avoid being checked by the French colonists. It was not until after Mr. Lu Xun's death in 1936 that a newspaper briefly introduced Mr. Lu Xun's literary career and translated the short story "Kong Yiji."

During the period when Vietnam was still bound by the shackles of French imperialism, the French imperialists' ban on Mr. Lu Xun's books seemed even stricter than Chiang Kai-shek's ban on his books. After 1930, it seemed that China only banned twelve kinds of Mr. Lu Xun's books, while in Vietnam almost all of them were banned. Even two collections of novels were nowhere to be bought. But at that time, we clearly knew that Mr. Lu Xun was an enemy of Chiang Kai-shek, a friend of the Chinese people, and also an enemy of the French colonists and a friend of the Vietnamese people.

Soon after the success of the August Revolution, Mr. Deng Tai Mei introduced Lu Xun's works. He translated "The True Story of Ah Q," and he also wrote a long article introducing the author in front of the book. From that time on, our Vietnamese people understood Mr. Lu Xun better than before. Even during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the "Literary Gazette" also translated the short story "Blessing," which was very popular; today, no one in the literary community does not know this novel.

After the restoration of peace, the Vietnamese Literary Association published a selection of Lu Xun's novels, and this year it published a selection of Lu Xun's essays.

This time last year, in the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnamese Literary Association held a Lu Xun memorial meeting. It is certain that in the future, Mr. Lu Xun's articles and thoughts will not only penetrate the literary world more widely, but will also spread more and more widely among all the Vietnamese people. The terms Ah Q and Xiang Lin's Wife have begun to appear in the Vietnamese language.

In the past, our country's philosophical thoughts, such as Confucianism and Taoism, were mostly influenced by Chinese culture. Even Buddhism, which originated in India, was introduced to Vietnam through China. The spirit of these philosophical thoughts has brought very good results to the spiritual life of the Vietnamese nation.

Today, the cultural exchanges between our two countries are more extensive and richer. Among the new modern ideas in China, Lu Xun's thought has been brought to us. Today, we are honored to participate in the memorial meeting of the great writer, and we firmly believe that Mr. Lu Xun's thought of "not forgiving the enemy" will penetrate the hearts of every Vietnamese person, so as to resist American imperialism and its lackeys, and quickly realize the peace and unification of our beloved motherland.

I personally read Mr. Lu Xun’s books a long time ago. I have special feelings for Mr. Lu Xun. Here, let me recite a poem I wrote in Chinese in Vietnamese. The title of the poem is "Ode to Lu Xun."

　　Against Confucius "not to go too far"
　　"Beat the dog in the water," "forgive no one"
　　Against Jesus "love your enemies as friends."
　　Majestic Lu Xun "proletarian saint"
　　I firmly believe that this statement is correct.
　　I have read your books for thirty years,
　　I regret not meeting you before you died,
　　Fortunately, I can see before I die,
　　The sky of the new China after your death!

    越南作家潘魁的讲话
    我们能够代表越南文艺知识界来参加鲁迅先生逝世二十周年纪念会，感到无限的荣幸。今天，不仅是我们，而且是我国整个文艺界人士都怀着尊敬和感激的心情来追念已故中国大文豪。
    鲁迅先生不仅是一位中国的大文豪，而且是世界的大文豪。先生的文学事业早就影响了我国，但是在8月革命以后，这种影响才日益广泛起来。
    1928年之后，越南的文艺界才知道鲁迅的名字。当时虽然偶尔有几家报馆翻译一些鲁迅先生的文章，但这些文章都不是很显露的，这样可以不受到法国殖民者的检查。直至1936年先生去世之后，化日才有一家报馆简要地介绍了先生的文学事业，并且译载了“孔乙己”短篇小说。
  　当越南还在法帝国主义的枷锁束缚之下的时期，法帝国主义者对鲁迅先生的书籍的禁止好像比蒋介石对他的书籍的禁止还要严密得多。1930年后，中国禁止鲁迅先生的书籍好像只有十二种，而在越南却几乎全部被禁止了。甚至连两本小说集也无处买。但是那时我们清楚地知道鲁迅先生是蒋介石的敌人，是中国人民的朋友，同样也是法国殖民者的敌人，是越南人民的朋友。
    8月革命成功不久，邓泰梅先生就介绍鲁迅著作。他翻译了阿Q正传，他在书的前面还写了一篇很长的介绍作者的文章。从那时起，我们越南人民比以前更了解先生了。甚至在抗战时期，文艺报也译载了短篇小说“祝福”，这篇短篇小说深受欢迎；今天，在文艺界人士中，更没有谁不知道这篇小说了。
    在和平恢复之后，越南文艺会出版了鲁迅小说选集，今年又出版了鲁迅杂文选集。
    去年的今天，在越南民主共和国首都，越南文艺会举行了一次鲁迅纪念会。可以肯定，今后鲁迅先生的文章和思想，不仅会更广泛地深入到文艺界，而且一定会在全体越南人民中间日益广泛地传播开来。阿Q、祥林嫂的名词已经开始在越南的语言里出现了。
    我们国家过去的哲学思想，比方儒教和道教，大部分都受到中国文化的影响。就连发源于印度的佛教也是通过中国才传到越南来的。这些哲学思想的精神，给越南民族的精神生活，带来了很良好的结果。
    今天，我们两国的文化交流更加广泛和丰富了。在中国现代的新思想中，给我们带来了鲁迅的思想。今天，我们荣幸地参加大文豪的纪念会，我们坚信先生的“不宽恕敌人”的思想将会深入到每一个越南人的心灵，以反抗美帝国主义及其走狗，迅速地实现我们亲爱的祖国的和平和统一。
    我个人在很久之前就看先生的书了。我对先生有着特别的感情，在这里，让我用越南文来念我用中文写的一首诗，诗的题目是“颂鲁迅”。
    反孔子“不为己甚”
    “打落水狗”，“不宽恕谁”
    反耶苏“爱敌如友”。
    巍巍乎鲁迅“无产的圣人”
    我深信此言不谬。
    我读公书卅年，
    恨不相见公死前，
    偏幸能及我死前，
    得见公死后新中国的天！
