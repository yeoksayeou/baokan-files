Xinhua News Agency, October 17th: Paris dispatch: The French National Assembly began debating the Suez Canal issue on October 16th. French Prime Minister Mollet and Foreign Minister Pineau attended the debate.

    Deputies representing right-wing parliamentary groups strongly criticized the Mollet government for its "insufficiently resolute action" on the Suez issue in their speeches, and insisted on continuing to implement the bankrupt "position of strength" policy towards Egypt.
    Former Prime Minister and Independent Republican Paul Reynaud attacked the six principles for a peaceful resolution of the Suez issue adopted by the United Nations Security Council. In a bellicose tone, he said, "The government must tell us why it is not forcing Egypt to accept the results of the London Conference. Why hasn't it used force as it said it would?" He also said, "The longer the time drags on, the greater Nasser's victory will be."
    French Foreign Minister Pineau, in his speech, asked the National Assembly not to be "overly pessimistic" about the Suez Canal issue. He said that although the West may have suffered several setbacks, "the government still has ways now." He believed that the National Assembly's debate had strengthened the government's position in continuing to take a tough stance in dealing with this issue. Pineau said: "The cards we hold have not been exhausted. We will see who the victor is at the end of this struggle."
    Pineau made it clear that the French government has "undeniably felt disappointed" with the United States' attitude towards the Suez Canal issue. He complained that it was difficult to see what the direction of American policy was. Referring to the news that American oil and shipping companies were proposing to form a consortium to operate the Suez Canal in place of the former Suez Canal International Company, Pineau said, "Although the US government has not yet accepted this plan, in the name of the French government and the National Assembly, I think I can say that if it is a question of an American company replacing the French-British and international association, then French public opinion will strongly disapprove of this idea, and it will definitely hinder the good relations between France and the United States." Pineau said that although "the Atlantic Pact must be maintained, this alliance is a whole and cannot be split into several parts." Pineau said that another lesson France learned from the Suez Canal issue was that the construction of Europe must be accelerated in cooperation with Britain.
    Pineau finally stated that if France ultimately participated in the Suez Canal Users' Association, it would only do so with reservations, and this was also in order not to split with Britain.
    Communist Deputy Roger Garaudy spoke in the debate, vehemently criticizing the French government's policy on the Suez issue. He pointed out that Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company stemmed from its own vital interests, and this legitimate action by the Egyptian government was fully in line with international law. Garaudy condemned the Western countries' practice of putting pressure on Egypt in an attempt to force Egypt to abandon its sovereignty. He demanded that the French foreign authorities negotiate with Egypt in a spirit of sincerity to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Suez issue.

    法国国民议会辩论苏伊士问题
    比诺表示还要继续采取强硬态度
    法共要求同埃及谈判争取和平解决
    据新华社17日讯　巴黎消息：法国国民议会10月16日开始辩论苏伊士运河问题。法国总理摩勒和外交部长比诺出席了这次辩论。
    代表右翼议会党团的议员们在发言中猛烈抨击摩勒政府在苏伊士问题上的“行动不够坚决”，并且坚持要继续对埃及实行已经破了产的“实力地位”政策。
    前总理、独立共和党人保罗·雷诺攻击联合国安全理事会通过的关于和平解决苏伊士问题的六项原则。他以好战的口吻说，“政府必须告诉我们为什么它不强迫埃及接受伦敦会议的结果。为什么它没有像它所说的那样使用武力？”他还说，“时间越是拖下去，纳赛尔的胜利就越大。”
    法国外交部长比诺在发言的时候要求国民议会对苏伊士运河问题不要“过分悲观”。他说，虽然西方可能已经受到过几次挫折，但是“政府现在仍然有办法”。他认为，国民议会的辩论已经加强了政府继续采取强硬态度来处理这个问题的地位。比诺说：“我们手里的王牌还没有用完。我们将会看到在这场斗争结束时谁是胜利者。”
    比诺明白表示：对于美国对待苏伊士运河问题的态度，法国政府已经“无可否认地感到失望”。他抱怨说，很难看出美国政策的方针究竟是怎样。在谈到关于美国的石油和航运公司正在建议成立一个财团来代替前苏伊士运河国际公司经营苏伊士运河的消息时，比诺说，“虽然美国政府还没有接受这个方案。但是，以法国政府和国民议会的名义，我想我能够说，如果这是一个由一家美国公司来代替法国—英国和国际协会的问题，那么，法国舆论将对这种意见表示很不赞成，它肯定地会妨碍法国和美国之间的良好关系。”比诺说，虽然“大西洋公约是必须维持的，但是这个联盟是一个整体，不能分裂成为几个部分”。比诺说，法国从苏伊士运河问题中获得的另一个教训是：欧洲的建设必须同英国合作加速进行。
    比诺最后表示，如果说法国最后参加了苏伊士运河使用国协会，它仅仅是有保留地这样做，而这样也是为了不同英国分裂。
    共产党议员罗歇·加罗迪在辩论中发言，猛烈批评法国政府在苏伊士问题上的政策。他指出，埃及把苏伊士运河公司收归国有的出发点是自己的切身利益，埃及政府这种合法行动完全符合国际法准则。加罗迪谴责西方国家对埃及施加压力企图迫使埃及放弃自己主权的做法。他要求法国外交当局本着诚意的精神同埃及进行谈判，争取苏伊士问题的和平解决。
