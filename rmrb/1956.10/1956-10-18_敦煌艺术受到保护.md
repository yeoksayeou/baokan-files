Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 16th. The artists at the Dunhuang Cultural Relics Research Institute will soon complete six large-scale mural replicas.

	These six murals are all from Cave 25 of the Yulin Caves, each mural being more than ten square meters in size. According to the artists who are copying the murals, these are among the best of the Tang Dynasty murals they have copied, having reached perfection in terms of both the techniques for handling the subject matter and the lines and colors.

	Over the past few years, the artists at the Dunhuang Cultural Relics Research Institute have copied 400 square meters of murals. More than 380 square meters were exhibited at the Dunhuang Art Exhibition held in Beijing in 1955. These murals include sutra illustrations, Buddhist story paintings, Buddha statues, portraits of donors, decorative patterns, and more. The largest mural is more than 30 square meters. The three sets of Dunhuang mural selections they have published have been well-received by those at home and abroad who love Dunhuang art, and they have recently published a popular edition of Dunhuang mural selections.

	The Dunhuang Cultural Relics Research Institute has also established a specialized organization responsible for repairing the caves. Five Song Dynasty cave eaves have been restored to their original state, and more than 300 meters of newly built bridges, corridors, staircases, and steps have been constructed. The accumulated sand inside and outside the caves has been cleared, the collapsed walls have been repaired, and doors and windows will be installed in many caves.

    敦煌艺术受到保护
    新华社兰州16日电　敦煌文物研究所的美术家们将在最近完成六幅大型壁画摹本。
    这六幅壁画都出在榆林窟第二十五号洞中，每幅画有十几平方公尺大。据临摹壁画的美术家谈，他们所临摹的唐代壁画中，这几幅要算最好，不论在处理题材的手法上，或者在线条和色彩方面，都达到了完美的境地。
    敦煌文物研究所的美术家们几年来已临摹了四百平方公尺壁画，1955年在北京举办的敦煌艺术展览会上就展出了三百八十多平方公尺。这些壁画包括经变图、佛教故事画、佛像、供养人像、装饰图案等等。最大的壁画有三十多平方公尺。他们出版的三套敦煌壁画选受到国内外爱好敦煌艺术的人们的欢迎，最近又出版了敦煌壁画选普及本。
    敦煌文物研究所还设立了专门的机构负责修缮洞窟。有五座宋代窟檐已恢复原状，新建的桥廊、楼梯、阶梯共有三百多公尺。洞窟内外的积沙都清除了，坍毁的墙壁进行了修补，很多洞窟都要安上门窗。
