    Washington's Double-Edged Sword
    Li Gao
    Following the failure of the Second London Conference, the United States, Britain, and France, while piecing together the so-called "Users' Association" and "appealing" to the United Nations Security Council against Egypt, are also plotting a so-called "boycott" of the Suez Canal—that is, taking adventurous actions to disrupt or block canal navigation. It is not difficult to see that this plan is still a double-edged sword being wielded by the United States on the Suez Canal issue: one edge is to encourage Britain and France to take risks against Egypt and countries supporting Egypt, so that the situation in the Middle East continues to be tense and chaotic, so as to weaken the power of Britain and France; the other edge is to take advantage of the situation to further control Britain and France and seize their interests.
    As everyone knows, the United States originally had little say in the old Suez Canal Company. Out of 800,000 shares, the United States only had 2,001 shares, and out of hundreds of foreign personnel, there were only two Americans. Moreover, it was not a signatory to the 1888 treaty. However, because Britain and France attempted to use the influence of the United States to suppress Egypt this time, the United States took the opportunity to intervene. As a result, Egypt was not overwhelmed, but Britain and France lost the initiative. At the past two London conferences, Britain and France had effectively become guests of the United States. What is even more thought-provoking is that while the United States encouraged Britain and France to withdraw the British and French pilots working in the canal, it approved a batch of American pilots to accept employment in Egypt. The intention of "replacing them" is very obvious.
    The United States hopes that the Suez Canal issue will remain tense for a long time or worsen further, and the reason is not difficult to understand. Because it is Britain and France that suffer, while the United States can further reap the benefits.
    Take the oil issue, for example. Of the 120 million tons of crude oil consumed by Western European countries each year, 75% comes from the Middle East. In 1955, Britain imported more than 20 million tons of crude oil through the Suez Canal. It is estimated that once the Suez Canal is closed, five million people in Britain will be unemployed overnight. The United States will not feel sad about this situation. The United States produces more than half of the capitalist world's oil, and it also controls a large amount of oil resources in Latin America. Most of the oil extracted by American oil monopolies in the Middle East is also transported to Western Europe. Therefore, even if they suffer a little risk in the Middle East, they can take the opportunity to expand domestic and Latin American oil production and raise oil prices to transport oil to Western Europe. This will not only generate huge profits, but also further control the economic and defense lifeline of Western European countries, making Britain, France, and other countries "junior partners" of the United States for a long time. The French newspaper "France Observateur" once pointed out: If chaos occurs in the Middle East, "American oil companies can remain calm, because they are very clear that due to the enormous scale of their exploration and control in Latin America, any disruption of Middle Eastern oil extraction can only make supply scarce and prices rise, thus being unfavorable to European competitors and strengthening the position of American companies... We can even imagine this: the day all Middle Eastern oil wells are closed, American companies will control almost complete monopoly of the global oil market."
    In the past two decades, the rapid increase in Middle Eastern oil production has been regarded as "disastrous competition" for domestic oil production in the United States, because the production cost of American oil is many times higher than that of the Middle East. At present, more than 20% of American domestic oil production equipment is idle. Therefore, after the Suez Canal issue occurred, various domestic oil monopolies in the United States were overjoyed and repeatedly discussed plans to expand production and transport oil to Western Europe, and established a special organization for this purpose. The US government also threatened to lend money to Western European countries to buy American oil, and at the same time began to drag out a batch of idle US reserve oil tankers for repairs and preparations. All of this is in preparation for making a fortune from Western European countries. The British probably still remember that when the Iranian oil issue occurred in 1951, Britain had to spend 25 to 30 million US dollars per month to buy oil from the United States. This greatly deteriorated Britain's financial situation at the time, while American oil companies made an extra profit and took the opportunity to intervene in Iran, gaining a large portion of Iran's oil interests. Obviously, the United States is now eagerly hoping for such a good thing to happen again.
    In terms of market competition, the United States also fears nothing more than world chaos. The sterling area, the lifeline of the British economy, is mostly east of the Suez Canal. If detouring around South Africa, the cost of British transportation to India will increase by 30%, and to other parts of the Far East by 20%. However, the main overseas markets of the United States are in the Americas, Western Europe, and the Far East, which are not affected by the Suez Canal. In 1955, British ships passed through the Suez Canal 4,358 times, carrying 32.79 million tons of cargo; American ships passed through the Suez Canal only 380 times, carrying 3.13 million tons of cargo, less than one-tenth of the British.
    In recent years, the US squeezing out of Britain in the Middle East market has been very fierce. US exports to five countries including Iran and Iraq increased by 43% in the first nine months of 1955 compared with the same period in 1954, while British exports to these countries increased by only 13% during the same period. Due to the Suez Canal incident, Britain's situation in the Middle East has further deteriorated, which is naturally another good opportunity for American competitors. The Washington "Star" said bluntly on April 4 this year: "Britain's prestige and century-old leadership there (in the Middle East) have suffered one misfortune after another, but our State Department has in most cases been willing to inherit Britain's usual leadership in this region."
    In the Southeast Asian and Australian markets, the United States is not only squeezing out Britain itself, but also supporting Japan in its competition for the British market in order to ease the sharp contradictions between the United States and Japan on trade and "embargo" issues. Britain has been failing in many places. In 1955, US exports to Pakistan increased by 70.3% compared with 1954, while British exports to Pakistan decreased by 20.2%. Japanese exports to Australia and India both increased by nearly double in 1955 compared with 1954, and many British commodities are already difficult to compete with American and Japanese commodities in terms of price and delivery terms. Therefore, it is self-evident what the consequences will be if British commodities are further burdened by transportation costs.
    Many people in the ruling classes of Britain and France have seen through this double-dealing approach of the United States on the Suez Canal issue. The French "Le Monde" pointed out: "For old Europe, the Suez incident may lead to a decline in living standards and create unemployment. But for some people in the United States, this already seems like the hope of full employment and prosperity." The British business newspaper "Financial Times" also said: "The United States is the least affected country after the blockade (boycott) of the Suez Canal, but Britain is more affected than anyone else... Britain and other countries will be extremely unwilling to bear the burden of more dollar loans." Former British Defense Minister Shinwell believes that some elements in the United States want to kick Britain out of the Middle East. However, there are some people in the British and French ruling groups who are blinded by the ambition to regain colonial interests and still fantasize about dragging the United States into pulling chestnuts out of the fire for them. If these people are unwilling to serve as martyrs for their own national interests, now is the time to soberly regain a sense of reality.

    华盛顿的两面刀
    李高
    在第二次伦敦会议失败之后，美、英、法三国在拼凑所谓“使用国协会”和向联合国安理会“控告”埃及的同时，还在策划一个所谓“抵制”苏伊士运河——即采取冒险行动来破坏或封锁运河航行的计划。不难看出，这个计划仍然是美国在苏伊士运河问题上玩弄的一种两面刀：它的一面是鼓励英法向埃及以及支持埃及的国家冒险，使中近东局势继续紧张和混乱下去，以削弱英法力量；另一面则是借此混水摸鱼，进一步宰制英法，夺取它们的利益。
    大家知道，美国在前苏伊士运河公司本来是没有什么发言权的，八十万股股票中美国只有二千零一股，数百外籍人员中只有两个美国人，并且它也不是1888年条约的签字国家。可是，由于这次英、法两国企图借助美国的势力来压制埃及，美国就乘机插手进来了。结果，埃及并没有被压倒，而英法两国却丧失了主动权。在过去的两次伦敦会议上，英法都实际上变成了美国的陪宾。更耐人寻味的是，美国一面鼓励英法撤退了在运河工作的英法籍引水员，另一面它却批准了一批美国引水员应聘到埃及去工作。“取而代之”的意图是非常明显的。
    美国希望苏伊士运河问题长期紧张或更加恶化，原因是不难理解的。因为吃亏的是英法，美国却可以进一步坐收渔利。
    拿石油问题来说罢。西欧各国每年消耗的一亿二千万吨原油，75％来自中东。英国在1955年通过苏伊士运河进口原油达二千余万吨。有人估计，苏伊士运河一旦不通，英国在一夜之间就将有五百万人失业。对于这种情况，美国是不会感到痛心的。美国的石油生产占资本主义世界的二分之一以上，它还控制着拉丁美洲的大量油源。美国石油垄断公司在中东开采的石油，也大部分是运销西欧的。因此，即使在中东遭受一点风险，它们却能借此机会扩大国内和拉丁美洲的石油生产，并且抬高油价运销西欧。这不但能获得暴利，而且还能进一步扼制西欧国家的经济和国防命脉，使英、法等国长期地做美国的“小伙伴”。法国报纸“法兰西观察家”曾经指出：如果中东发生混乱，“美国的石油公司可以泰然处之，因为它们十分明白：由于它们在拉丁美洲的勘探与控制规模极大，任何搅乱中东石油开采的情况只能使供应稀少，价格上涨，从而不利于欧洲竞争者而加强美国公司的地位。……我们简直可以这样设想：所有中东的油井封闭的那一天，美国公司将掌握全世界石油市场的几乎完全的垄断。”
    近二十年来，中近东石油的急速增产，对美国国内的石油生产被视为是“灾难性的竞争”，因为美国石油的生产成本比中近东贵许多倍。目前，美国国内的石油生产设备有20％以上被闲置未用。因此，苏伊士运河问题发生后，美国国内各石油垄断公司都喜气洋洋，接连几次会商扩大生产和运销西欧的计划，并为此而建立了一个专门机构。美国政府也扬言可以贷款给西欧国家购买美国的石油，同时动手把闲置着的一批美国后备油船拖出来修整备用。这都是准备向西欧各国大捞一把的。英国人大概还记得，1951年伊朗的石油问题发生时，英国每月要花二千五百万到三千万美元向美国购买石油。这曾使当时英国的财政状况大为恶化，而美国的石油公司却获得了一笔额外的利润，并且乘机插手伊朗，取得了伊朗石油权益的很大一部分。显然，美国现在正是眼巴巴地盼望再出现这样的好事。
    在争夺市场方面，美国也是唯恐天下不乱的。作为英国经济的生命线的英镑区，绝大部分在苏伊士运河以东。如果要绕道南非，英国来往印度的运输费用要提高30％，到远东其他各地要提高20％。而美国的海外市场主要是在美洲、西欧和远东，都不受苏伊士运河的影响。1955年，英国船只通过苏伊士运河达四千三百五十八次，载运货物三千二百七十九万吨；美国船只通过苏伊士运河只有三百八十次，载货三百一十三万吨，不及英国的十分之一。
    近年来，英国在中东市场上受到美国的排挤本来已十分激烈了。美国对伊朗、伊拉克等五个国家的出口，1955年头九个月比1954年同期增加了43％，而英国对这些国家的出口同期只增加了13％。由于苏伊士运河事件，英国在中东的处境更加恶化了，这对美国竞争者自然又是一个好机会。华盛顿“明星报”在今年4月4日就曾毫不客气地说：“英国在那里（指中东）的威信和百年来的领导地位遭到了一次又一次的不幸，但是，我们的国务院在大多数情况下一直是愿意继承英国在这个地区的通常的领导权的。”
    在东南亚和澳洲市场上，美国不但自己在排挤着英国，而且支持日本争夺英国的市场以图缓和美日之间在贸易和“禁运”问题上的尖锐矛盾。英国在许多地方已节节失败。1955年，美国对巴基斯坦的出口比1954年增加了70.3％，而英国对巴基斯坦的出口反而下降了20.2％。日本对澳大利亚和对印度的输出，在1955年都比1954年增加将近一倍，许多英国商品在价格和交货条件等方面已经很难和美国、日本商品竞争。因此，英国商品如果在运输上再加负担，后果如何是不言可知的。
    对于美国在苏伊士运河问题上的这种两面三刀的做法，英法两国统治阶级中也有许多人是看穿了的。法国“世界报”指出：“对古老的欧洲，苏伊士事件可能使得生活水平下降，造成失业。而对美国的某些人来说，这已经好像是充分就业、繁荣的希望。”英国实业界的“金融时报”也说：“美国是在封锁（抵制）苏伊士运河之后受害最少的国家，然而，英国受害却比谁都要大。……英国和其他国家将是极其不愿意背上更多的美元贷款的负担的。”英国前国防大臣辛威尔认为，美国的一些分子是想把英国踢出中东。但是，英法统治集团中却有这么一部分人，他们被夺回殖民利益的野心冲昏了头脑，至今还幻想拖着美国为他们火中取栗。这些人如果不愿意充当他们自己的国家利益的殉葬人的话，现在是应当清醒地恢复现实感的时候了。
