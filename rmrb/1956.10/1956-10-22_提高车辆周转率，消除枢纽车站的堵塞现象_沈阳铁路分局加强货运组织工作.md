Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 20th (Xinhua Reporter Shen Junhai): The 52 stations under the Shenyang Sub-bureau of the Shenyang Railway Administration have implemented direct train and grouped loading methods for freight organization. This has improved vehicle turnover and shunting efficiency, overcoming the frequent congestion at hub stations.

The railway transportation task in the Shenyang area is very heavy. Thousands of freight cars carrying machinery, equipment and various materials enter and leave the railway lines in this area every day. Since the beginning of this year, factories and mines across the country have launched advanced producer movements, and the machinery and equipment produced and the construction materials needed by basic construction units have continued to increase. The off-season for freight in previous years—the third quarter—has become a peak season this year. The volume of freight has not only increased by 28.2% compared with the same period last year, but also increased by 15.8% compared with the first quarter of this year. However, the technical equipment of the five hub stations in Shenyang, Sujiatun, and Huanggu Tun is still relatively backward, and they are not capable of undertaking such heavy transportation tasks, which often causes congestion.

In order to overcome the congestion at hub stations and reduce the workload of uncoupling and grouping, 52 stations in the Shenyang area officially implemented direct train and grouped loading methods for freight organization starting in September. Currently, 67% of the total cargo transported by these stations uses this method. For example, 80% to 90% of the steel transported from Anshan to Guannei, the coal transported from Fushun to Dalian and Andong, and the bricks, tiles, sand and gravel transported from Nantai Station to Fushun are formed into direct trains. When these direct trains pass through hub stations, they do not need to be uncoupled and grouped, and can directly pass through to the final destination station.

In order to solve the problem of scattered goods that cannot be organized into direct trains, various stations in the Shenyang area have organized more than 60% of the factories, mines, and enterprises that need to transport goods to formulate a direct, grouped daily calendar loading plan. Each station sends grouped freight cars to the hub station every day according to the plan, and after a short period of grouping work, they can be formed into trains and driven out of the station. If the goods at one hub station are not enough to form a train, it can also contact several other hub stations to form freight cars heading in the same direction into a train in a timely manner and drive to the final destination station.

Now, after the 52 stations under the Shenyang Sub-bureau of the Shenyang Railway Administration have implemented this freight organization method, the vehicle turnover efficiency has increased by 8%, and the shunting efficiency of uncoupling, grouping, and other operations at each hub station has increased by 22.5%, thus solving the frequent and serious congestion at hub stations.

    提高车辆周转率，消除枢纽车站的堵塞现象
    沈阳铁路分局加强货运组织工作
    新华社沈阳20日电　新华社记者沈俊海报道：沈阳铁路管理局沈阳分局所属五十二个车站，实行了直达列车和成组装车的货运组织工作方法，提高了车辆周转和调车的效率，克服了枢纽车站经常发生的堵塞现象。
    沈阳地区铁路运输任务非常繁重，千百辆载着机器设备和各种物资的货车，每天都要在这个地区的铁路线上进出。今年以来，全国各地厂矿开展了先进生产者运动，生产出来的机器设备和基本建设单位所需要的建筑器材不断增加，往年的运货淡季——第三季度，今年成了旺季，运货量不仅比去年同时期增加了28.2％，而且也比今年第一季度增加了15.8％。但是，沈阳、苏家屯、皇姑屯等五个枢纽车站的技术设备还相当落后，对这样繁重的运输任务，没有能力担负，经常发生堵塞现象。
    为了克服枢纽车站的堵塞，减少解体、成组的调车工作量，沈阳地区五十二个车站，从9月份起正式实行了直达列车和成组装车的货运组织工作方法。现在，这些车站装运的货物总量中，有67％采用了这种方法。如鞍山运往关内的钢铁，抚顺运往大连、安东方面的煤炭，南台车站运往抚顺的砖瓦砂石，有80％到90％组成了直达列车。这些直达列车经过枢纽车站时，不必再经过解体、成组，可以直接通往终点车站。
    为了解决零散货物不能编组直达列车的问题，沈阳地区各个车站组织了60％以上需要运货的厂矿、企业，制订了直达、成组日历装车计划。各个车站每天按照计划把成组的货车驶往枢纽车站，经过短时间的编组工作，便可组成列车驶出车站。一个枢纽车站的货物若不够组成一个列车，还可同其他几个枢纽车站联系，把开往同一方向的货车，及时组成列车，驶向终点车站。
    现在，沈阳铁路管理局沈阳分局所属五十二个车站，实行了这种货运组织工作方法以后，车辆周转效率提高了8％，各枢纽车站的解体、成组等调车效率提高了22.5％，因此解决了枢纽车站经常发生的严重堵塞现象。
