Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 20th: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a plenary session on the 19th and passed a resolution. The resolution analyzes France's domestic and foreign policies in recent months and defines the tasks of French communists.

The resolution points out that the so-called "appeasement" policy implemented in Algeria has only worsened the situation, and the government's stance on the Suez Canal issue has created a threat of new adventures. This policy has nullified measures for social progress and caused chaos in the country's economic life.

The resolution states that the Socialist Party and the Radical Party rejected the Communist Party's proposal to establish an alliance, and thus had to cater to the reactionaries and implement policies that violated the interests of the working people and the whole country, as well as their own election promises. This policy has aroused increasingly strong opposition from the working people and republicans, who, after the elections of January 2, 1956, have become convinced that it is impossible to implement any policy that conforms to the wishes of the working class and the national interests without the Communist Party.

The plenary session emphasized that the workers participating in the Socialist Party are increasingly eager to take united action with the Communist Party. Currently, many members and organizations of the Socialist Party have acted jointly with their communist comrades to fight for the cessation of war, for negotiations in Algeria, and for a peaceful resolution of the Suez issue. The shift to the left among the urban and rural middle classes, which was also reflected in the congress of the Radical Socialist Party, is a good factor for the unity of democratic forces.

The resolution points out that all these facts prove that it is now entirely possible to implement democratic policies relying on the left-wing majority, which holds a majority position in parliament and has even greater power nationwide.

The resolution points out that the united front of communist and socialist party members is a condition for political changes that enable the country to implement democratic policies, emphasizing the need to strive to complete the tasks facing the Communist Party and the working class—on the one hand, to achieve trade union unity, and on the other hand, to achieve consistency in the actions of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party.

The plenary session called on all communist party members to continuously promote the development of the united front as the basis for the unity of all democratic and social forces.

On the morning of the 19th, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party also discussed issues such as the working conditions and material situation of the working people and the work of women. In order to invigorate women's work, the Central Committee decided to hold a "National Women's Day" in early February next year.

    法共中央全会通过决议
    指责政府对阿尔及利亚和苏伊士问题的立场
    强调法国当前有可能依靠左派多数实行民主政策
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社巴黎19日讯：法国共产党中央委员会全体会议19日通过了一项决议。决议分析了最近几个月来法国的内政和外交政策，并且确定了法国共产党人的任务。
    决议指出，在阿尔及利亚实行的所谓“绥靖”政策只是使得情况日益恶化，而政府对待苏伊士运河问题的立场造成了新冒险的威胁。这个政策使社会进步方面的措施化为乌有，并且引起了国家经济生活的混乱。
    决议说，社会党和激进党拒绝了共产党关于建立联盟的建议，这样一来就不得不迎合反动派，执行违反劳动人民和全国利益以及他们自己竞选诺言的政策。这种政策引起了劳动人民和共和人士愈来愈强烈的反对，他们在1956年1月2日的选举之后已经相信没有共产党员就不可能实行符合工人阶级的愿望和民族利益的任何政策。
    全体会议强调指出，参加社会党的劳动者日益渴望同共产党采取一致行动。目前社会党的许多党员和组织已经同自己的共产党同志们共同行动，为停止战争、争取在阿尔及利亚谈判、为和平解决苏伊士问题而斗争，城乡中间阶层向左转的变化，在激进社会党的代表大会上也反映了出来，这种变化对民主力量的团结是一个良好的因素。
    决议指出，所有这些事实都证明现在完全有可能依靠左派多数实行民主政策，左派在议会中占多数地位，在全国范围内来说势力就更大。
    决议指出共产党员和社会党员的统一战线是使国家实行民主政策这种政治变化的条件，强调必须争取完成共产党和工人阶级所面临的任务——一方面实现工会的团结，另一方面实现共产党和社会党的行动的一致。
    全体会议号召一切共产党员不断促进作为一切民主社会力量团结的基础的统一战线的发展。
    19日上午，法国共产党中央委员会全体会议曾经讨论了劳动人民的劳动条件与物质状况以及妇女工作等问题。为活跃妇女工作，中央委员会决定在明年2月初举行“全国妇女日”。
