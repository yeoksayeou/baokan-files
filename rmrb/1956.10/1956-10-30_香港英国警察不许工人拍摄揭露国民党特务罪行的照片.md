    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th: Hong Kong news: Eyewitnesses confirm that Yang Guanfu, a pharmacist at the Tsuen Wan Workers' Clinic in Kowloon, was brutally murdered by Kuomintang secret agents during the recent riots. However, the Hong Kong British police authorities are preventing workers from publicly revealing the horrific state of the deceased. Yang Guanfu's body was hastily buried in the Sha Ling Cemetery. Only after repeated and firm requests from the workers did the Hong Kong British police lead them to Sha Ling to identify the body. The workers saw more than ten corpses placed in a large box made of thin planks. Among them, Yang Guanfu's body had a split head, deep knife wounds on his back, and his teeth had fallen out, indicating a gruesome death. British police closely monitored the scene, forbidding workers from taking photographs of Yang Guanfu's condition. Later, when workers requested reburial, the British police allowed it but continued to closely monitor and prohibit photography.

    香港英国警察不许工人拍摄揭露国民党特务罪行的照片
    新华社广州29日电　香港消息：目击者证实：九龙荃湾工人医疗所配药师杨观福在这次骚乱中遭到国民党特务的残酷杀害。但是香港英国警察当局不让工人们公开死者的惨状。杨观福的尸体被草草掩埋在沙岭坟场，经过工人们再三坚决要求，香港英国警方才带领工人到沙岭去认尸。工人们看到在一个薄木板做的大箱中放着十多具尸体，其中杨观福的尸体脑袋被劈开，背部也有很深的刀伤，牙齿都脱落了，死状甚惨。英国警察当场严密监视，不准工人把杨观福的死状拍摄照片。后来工人们要求移葬，英国警察虽然允许，但仍严密监视不准摄影。
