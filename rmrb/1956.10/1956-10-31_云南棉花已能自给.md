    Yunnan Cotton Can Now Be Self-Sufficient
    (Our newspaper, Kunming, 27th) Yunnan Province overfulfilled its cotton production increase target by 25%. The average yield of ginned cotton per mu in the province was over 25 jin. In Binchuan, a major production area, the average yield reached 52 jin per mu, and in some individual locations, it exceeded 100 jin. Yunnan was previously a province unable to produce enough cotton for its own needs. Due to the overfulfillment of the tasks of expanding cotton fields and increasing yield per unit area, Yunnan Province is now self-sufficient in cotton this year, with a surplus to spare.
