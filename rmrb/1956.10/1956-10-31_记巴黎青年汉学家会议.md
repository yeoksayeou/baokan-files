A record of the Paris Conference of Young Sinologists
Jian Bozan
The annual Conference of Young Sinologists was held in Paris this year. Professors Xia Nai, Zhou Yiliang, Zhang Zhilian and I accepted the invitation to attend this conference in Paris.

Our group of four departed from Beijing on August 20th and returned to Beijing on September 23rd, a round trip of thirty-five days. Of these thirty-five days, twelve were spent in Moscow waiting for plane seats, three were spent in flight, and only twenty days were spent in Paris.

The conference opened on September 2nd and closed on September 8th, lasting for seven days. The opening ceremony was held in the evening, which seems to be a custom, as it was the same in Leiden last year. On the opening night, two elderly French Sinologists, Academician Paul Demiéville and Professor Paul Pelliot, spoke. In his address, Academician Demiéville welcomed the Sinologists from various countries to Paris on behalf of the French Sinologists, and especially welcomed the Chinese scholars. We thanked the French Sinologists for their friendly attitude towards China.

A total of one hundred and fifty-nine Sinologists were invited to participate in this conference, but some did not come, and some came temporarily. If the wives of some Sinologists are included, there were nearly two hundred people.

A total of fifteen Sinologists from China, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany attended this conference.

The largest number of Sinologists came from France and West Germany, with forty-five each; followed by the United Kingdom, with forty; other countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Sweden, Switzerland, Italy, Turkey, Vietnam, Japan, Australia, and the United States followed, ranging from one to four or five people each. In addition, there were three Chinese people from Hong Kong and Malaya.

The central issue discussed at this conference was the "Problem of Periodization of Chinese History." This issue, which has been debated endlessly in China, has aroused the interest of Sinologists from various countries. We encountered this issue in the Netherlands last year, and we also encountered it in Japan. It is very meaningful to bring this issue to the Conference of Young Sinologists for discussion this year.

A total of thirty-odd papers were presented at this conference, many of which discussed the "Problem of Periodization of Chinese History," and some discussed other various issues, such as politics, economics, literature, language, art, archaeology, religion, and so on.

Many interesting questions were raised in these papers, but unfortunately, the space in the newspaper does not allow me to write them all out. Now I can only make a brief summary.

Discussion on the Problem of Periodization of Chinese History

Generally speaking, the discussion on the problem of periodization of Chinese history at this conference did not touch on the essence of the problem, but only stayed on the outside of the problem. That is, it did not discuss well how to periodize, what standards to use for periodization, and other issues, but rather discussed issues such as whether or not periodization should be done. Only a very small number of Sinologists, such as the Soviet Sinologist G.V. Yefimov in his report "Periodization of Modern Chinese History," discussed the periodization of modern Chinese history. Academician H. Průšek, a Czech Sinologist, mentioned the disintegration of Chinese feudal society and the reflection of capitalist sprouts in literature in his report "Subjectivism and Individualism in Modern Chinese Literature."

It is very interesting that Sinologists from some countries are opposed to discussing the problem of historical periodization in principle. Professor H. Franke of the University of Munich in West Germany, in his report "The Meaning and Meaninglessness of Historical Periodization," opposed historical periodization in principle. Professor Franke studies Yuan history and has compiled bibliographies related to Sinology. He believes that historical periodization is only for the convenience of research, and historians should devote themselves to the collection and analysis of historical materials, and do not have to waste energy on the discussion of historical periodization. He also said that discussing the problem of historical periodization is meaningless, and using Marxism to discuss the problem of historical periodization is even more meaningless.

Professor Edwin G. Pulleyblank of Cambridge University in England, a specialist in Tang history, in his report "Ancient, Medieval, Modern," cited the periodization of ancient, medieval, and modern mentioned in Liu Zhiji's "Shitong" to argue that historical periodization since ancient times was only for the convenience of narration, and did not regard each period as having unique content. He therefore believes that Marxists regard each historical period as representing a stage of social development, which is the subjective intention of historians, and history itself does not have characteristics that can be used as periodization.

Professor J.J.L. Duyvendak of Leiden University in the Netherlands, an expert in Chinese history, also disagreed with using Marxism to divide historical periods in his report "A Brief Discussion on the Periodization of Chinese History." He said: "Marxists divide Chinese history according to social nature, just as Ma's Grammar uses Latin grammar to rigidly apply to Chinese grammar."

Another view is that history can be periodized, but only Western history can be periodized, and Chinese history cannot be periodized. If it is periodized, it is formalism. Professor Benjamin Schwartz of Harvard University in the United States emphasized this view in his lengthy report "The Formalization of the Periodization of Chinese History." He cited sentences from Marxist classics to criticize the two opinions on historical periodization that he believes are popular in China; he opposes the idea that China is an Asiatic society, and also opposes the idea that Chinese society and Western European society are developing according to the same law.

In addition to the above reports that oppose discussing historical periodization in principle, there are also reports that discuss historical periodization from specific issues. For example, Mr. Konta, a lecturer at the University of Mainz in West Germany, gave a report on "The Periodization of Chinese Landscape Painting," Professor Arthur F. Wright of Stanford University in the United States gave a report on "The Periodization of Chinese Buddhist History," Ms. Liang Peizhen of the French Oriental Language Institute gave a report on "The Periodization of Chinese Poetry," and Mr. De Pomp of the University of Cologne in West Germany also mentioned Yan Yu's periodization of Tang poetry in his report "Canglang Shihua." These reports raised the question of whether the periodization of literary and art history should be different from the periodization of social history. Unfortunately, there was not enough time for a full discussion.

It should also be mentioned that Professor Wolfgang Franke of the University of Hamburg in West Germany gave a report on "The Periodization of Modern and Contemporary Chinese History." In this report, Professor Franke emphasized the importance of the Xinhai Revolution. He believes that the Xinhai Revolution not only changed the political system, but also changed the traditional Confucian ideology of monarchical unity. Therefore, he believes that the Hundred Days' Reform and the Boxer Rebellion were preludes to the Xinhai Revolution; the May Fourth Movement and the Northern Expedition of 1926 were continuations of the Xinhai Revolution. As for the establishment of the People's Government in 1949, with social reform and political revolution proceeding simultaneously, whether it is a continuation of the Xinhai Revolution or the beginning of another new historical stage remains to be proven by history.

My companions and I also gave reports on the periodization of Chinese history and archaeological discoveries at the conference.

In addition, there were academic reports unrelated to the problem of periodization of Chinese history, such as the report by the Soviet Sinologist L.R. Zinder on "Experimental Results of Intonation in Chinese Questions," the report by the Czech Sinologist Professor Kalouskova on "Parts of Speech in Chinese," the report by Professor Reichelt of the University of Leipzig in East Germany on "The Use of Criminal Labor in Qin Dynasty Corvée Labor." There were also reports by the Australian Sinologist Camilla Behrsin on "The Marquisate System of the Han Dynasty," Wu Qiyu of Cambridge University on "The Life and Works of Hanshan," Professor Eck of the University of Hawaii in the United States on "Zen Paintings," Hoang Dai Phu, a Vietnamese Sinologist, on "The Earliest Relationship between Chinese and Vietnamese Medicine," and Professor Ichiko Chuzo of Ochanomizu University in Japan on "The Leadership of the Sichuan Railway Protection Movement."

All of these reports encountered opposing opinions, and therefore heated debates often arose in the meeting hall. The occurrence of this situation is easy to understand, because these Sinologists from all over the world not only speak different languages and study different problems, but also hold different beliefs, different worldviews, and use different historical methods. In a word, there are many, many differences, so differences of opinion in academia are very natural. But despite many differences, we can still sit in a room to hold meetings and discuss issues, because in addition to many differences, we also have a common point, that is, everyone studies Sinology.

In any case, differences of opinion in academia will never lead to war, at most only a fierce debate. Therefore, a friendly atmosphere has always been maintained in the meeting hall.

The opinions put forward at the conference are probably these. Although these opinions have great differences from our opinions, and even have principled differences, it is still beneficial to exchange them with each other. Because everyone can know from this that there are other opinions that differ from my own in the world.

In addition, some opinions were heard in individual conversations. For example, Professor Owen Lattimore of Johns Hopkins University in the United States pointed out that a shortcoming of our historians in dividing historical stages is that they overemphasize the reflection of culture and art. Professor Étiemble, a French Sinologist, pointed out that our periodization of modern history is too detailed, and history cannot undergo epoch-making changes in just a few years. Professor Duyvendak, a Dutch Sinologist, pointed out that some historians in our country not only divide the stages of Chinese history according to Western history, but even strive to make the beginning and end dates of each stage consistent with Western history. He believes that this is dogmatism. I think these opinions are still worth our reference.

In summary: we have gained a lot in this conference. Our gains are not only hearing various opinions on the problem of periodization of Chinese history, but also the friendship between us and Sinologists from various countries. This friendship is the best guarantee for our future cooperation with Sinologists from various countries in academic research.

The Friendship between Chinese and French Scholars

Here, I would like to mention the French Sinologists. The French Sinologists treated us friendly, and they never forgot to treat us as the most distinguished guests of the French scholars on any occasion. In the opening address, at the closing banquet, and at the reception hosted by the Mayor of Paris, we could feel this friendship from our French friends.

Academician Paul Demiéville, an elderly French Sinologist, is very concerned about China's writing reform. He talked about this issue at the banquet held to welcome us and praised our "steady progress" approach in the process of writing reform. It should be added that many other Sinologists are also concerned about this issue. Generally speaking, they approve of Latinization, but disapprove of simplified characters, because simplified characters add trouble to them.

Professor Li Jialuo, who studies Yuan history and modern Chinese history, cannot forget his days in Beijing. Just as we cannot forget the old bookstores on the banks of the Seine, he cannot forget the old bookstores in Liulichang, because these old bookstores seem to be a symbol of a city with a cultural tradition.

Professor Jacques Pimpaneau, who studies Chinese literature and drama, is very interested in Chinese Peking Opera. When the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe performed in Paris, he wrote many praising reviews.

Professor Vadime Elisseeff, who studies Chinese archaeology, greatly admired the abundance of archaeological discoveries in New China. He believes that such large-scale excavations are a huge contribution to human culture. He and his friend, Mr. Sal, who manages the museum affairs of France, also welcome Chinese archaeologists to participate in the excavation work in France.

It should be mentioned that a French friend I met at the Leiden Conference last year, Professor Balazs, who studies Song history. Everyone is concerned about the friendship between me and him, because we had a fierce debate at the Leiden Conference last year. But our friendship was not damaged by the debate. When I arrived in Paris, Professor Balazs still welcomed his opponent of last year with a very friendly attitude.

In addition to Sinologists, we cannot forget other French friends—French historians.

Academician Charles-Edmond Perrin, Dean of the Faculty of Arts of the University of Paris and a famous French historian, hopes that historians in our country will write articles for the "Historical Magazine" he edits, especially hoping to write a paper introducing the research of Chinese history.

Professor Chevalier, a professor at the Collège de France, the highest research institution in France, also hopes that historians in our country will write articles for the "Modern History Magazine" he edits. Professor Chevalier is a famous expert in the history of Paris, and he has conducted extremely detailed research on the history of the development of this city. He guided us to visit the houses and streets of Paris in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that still exist in Paris and are still being used today. He can tell the history of almost every old house. In addition, he also guided us to visit the site of the Paris Commune uprising—a residential area for handicraft workers.

Professor Bruhat and Professor Chesneaux of the University of Paris, excellent Marxist historians, enthusiastically guided us to visit the relics of the Paris Commune and the Montreuil Historical Museum. Professor Chesneaux and his friend, Professor René Grousset, an expert in Chinese Buddhist history, also guided us to visit the beautiful French countryside in the suburbs of Paris.

These French professors, whether Marxists or non-Marxists, all have a common desire, which is to restore the normal political and cultural relations between Beijing and Paris.

It should also be mentioned that the French youth I came into contact with, especially the youth studying Sinology, are yearning for and friendly to New China. Like their predecessors, they hope to pass their friendship to the Chinese youth through us.

In addition, Mr. Dubuis, the person in charge of the French National Centre for Scientific Research, also expressed to us his hope to cooperate with our country in scientific research; Mr. Berge, Director of the Higher Education Department of the French Ministry of Education, and Mr. Bayet, Deputy Director, also expressed to us at the reception they held for us their hope to exchange students and professors with our country.

As a professor in China, we welcome this friendship from French scholars and cherish this friendship. We hope to further develop our friendly cooperation in cultural and academic fields on the basis of this friendship, and restore the normal relations between China and France on a new historical basis.

    记巴黎青年汉学家会议
    翦伯赞
    一年一次的青年汉学家会议，今年在巴黎召开。我和夏鼐、周一良、张芝联三位教授接受了这个会议的邀请，前往巴黎去参加了这个会议。
    我们一行四人于8月20日从北京出发，9月23日回到北京，往返历时三十五天。在这三十五天中，有十二天是在莫斯科等候飞机坐位，有三天是在飞行中，住在巴黎的时间，只有二十天。
    会议于9月2日开幕，9月8日闭幕，一共开了七天。开幕的仪式是在夜晚举行，这好像是一个惯例，去年在莱顿也是如此。在开幕的那天夜晚，法国的两位年老的汉学家德密微院士和戴乐都教授说了话，德密微院士在他的致词中，代表法国的汉学家欢迎来到巴黎的各国汉学家，特别表示欢迎中国的学者。我们感谢法国的汉学家对中国的这种友好态度。
    被邀请参加这次会议的汉学家共有一百五十九人，但也有不来的，也有临时来的。如果把某些汉学家的夫人也算上，将近两百人。
    出席这次会议的中国、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和民主德国的汉学家，共有十五人。
    最大多数的汉学家是来自法国和西德，他们各有四十五人；英国次之，四十人；其他各国如荷兰、比国、奥国、瑞典、瑞士、意大利、土耳其、越南、日本、澳大利亚、美国等国又次之，自一人至四、五人不等。此外，还有从香港和马来亚来的三个中国人。
    这次会议讨论的中心问题是“中国历史分期问题”。这个在中国争论不休的问题已经引起了各国汉学家的兴趣。去年我们在荷兰遇到这个问题，在日本也遇到这个问题。今年把这个问题提到青年汉学家会议讨论一番，是很有意义的。
    在这次会议中提出来的论文一共有三十几篇，其中有不少是讨论“中国历史分期问题”的，也有讨论其他各种各样的问题的，如政治、经济、文学、语言、艺术、考古、宗教等等。
    在这些论文中提出了很多有趣味的问题，可惜报纸的篇幅不容许我全部写出来，现在我只能作一个简括的叙述。
  中国历史分期问题的讨论
    一般地说，在这次会议中关于中国历史分期问题的讨论，并未接触到这个问题的本质，只是停留在这个问题的外面。即没有很好地讨论如何分期，用什么标准分期等问题，而是讨论的应不应该分期这一类的问题。只有极少数的汉学家，如苏联的汉学家郭瓦略夫在他的报告“中国现代史的分期”中讨论到中国现代史分期问题。捷克斯洛伐克的汉学家普实克院士在他的报告“近代中国文学中的主观主义和个人主义”中说到了中国封建社会瓦解和资本主义萌芽在文学中的反映。
    很有趣味的是有些国家的汉学家从原则上反对讨论历史分期问题。西德慕尼黑大学教授Η·傅兰克在他的报告“历史分期的意义和无意义”一文中，就是从原则上反对历史分期的。傅兰克教授研究元史，曾经编著有关汉学的书目，是一位博学的汉学家。他认为历史的分期，仅是为了研究的方便，历史家应致力于史料的搜集与分析，不必徒耗精力于历史分期的讨论。又说讨论历史分期问题，没有意思，用马克思主义讨论历史分期问题，更没有意思。
    英国剑桥大学教授、唐史专家浦来布兰克在他的报告“上古、中古、近古”中，引据刘知几“史通”中提到的上古、中古、近古的分期，论证自古以来的历史分期只是为了叙述的方便，并不将各期视为各有特异的内容，从而认为马克思主义者把每一个历史时期代表一个社会发展阶段，是史学家主观的意图，历史本身并没有可以作为分期的特征。
    荷兰莱顿大学教授、汉史专家何四维在他“略谈中国史分期”的报告中，也不同意用马克思主义划分历史时期。他说：“马克思主义者把中国历史按社会性质分期，正如‘马氏文通’用拉丁文法硬套中国文法。”
    还有一种意见认为历史可以分期，但可以分期的只是西洋史，中国史不能分期，如果分期便是公式主义。美国哈佛大学教授史瓦兹在他的冗长的报告“中国历史分期的公式化”一文中强调了这种意见。他引据马克思主义经典著作中的词句，批评了他认为在中国流行的两种历史分期的意见；他反对中国是亚细亚式社会的说法，也反对中国社会和西欧社会是按照同一规律发展的说法。
    除了上述的一些从原则上反对讨论历史分期的报告以外，还有从具体问题上讨论历史分期的报告。例如西德梅因大学讲师孔达先生关于“中国山水画的分期”的报告，美国斯丹福大学赖特教授关于“中国佛教史分期”的报告，法国东方语学院梁佩贞女士关于“中国诗的分期”的报告，还有西德哥隆大学德朋先生在他的报告“沧浪诗话”中也提到宋人严羽对唐诗的分期。这些报告，提出了这样一个问题即文学艺术史的分期，应否和社会史分期有所不同。可惜时间不够，没有进行充分的讨论。
    还应该提到的是西德汉堡大学傅吾康教授关于“中国近代史和现代史的分期”的报告。在这个报告中，傅吾康教授强调辛亥革命的重要性，他认为辛亥革命不仅改变了政治制度，也改变了君主一统的传统的儒家思想。因此他以为戊戌变法、义和团是辛亥革命的前奏；五四运动和1926年的北伐是辛亥革命的继续。至于1949年人民政府成立，社会改革和政治革命同时进行，是辛亥革命的继续还是另一新的历史阶段的开始，尚有待于历史的证明。
    我和我的同伴们，也在会上作了关于中国历史分期和考古发现方面的报告。
    除此以外，还有与中国历史分期问题无关的学术报告，如苏联汉学家陆缅采夫关于“汉语发问时语调的实验结果”的报告，捷克斯洛伐克汉学家卡路斯葛娃教授关于“汉语的词类”的报告，民主德国莱比锡大学赖切奈夫教授关于“秦代劳役中使用刑徒”的报告。还有澳大利亚汉学家康比拉·毕伦斯坦关于“汉代侯国制度”的报告，剑桥大学吴其昱关于“寒山的平生和作品”的报告，美国夏威夷大学艾克教授关于“禅宗的画”的报告，越南汉学家黄大夫关于“中越医学最早的关系”的报告，日本茶茶水女子大学市古宙三教授关于“四川保路运动的首脑部”的报告。
    所有这些报告，没有一个不碰到反对意见的，因而在会场中经常卷起热烈的争论。这种情形的发生是容易理解的，因为这些来自世界各国的汉学家，不仅说着不同的言语，研究着不同的问题，而且还抱着不同的信仰，不同的世界观，使用着不同的历史方法，用一句话说，有很多很多的不同，因此在学术上的意见分歧是很自然的。但是尽管有很多不同，我们还是可以坐在一间房子里开会，讨论问题，这就是因为除了很多不同之外，我们之间还有一个共同之点，即大家都研究汉学。
    不论怎样，学术上的意见分歧决不会引起战争，最多不过展开一场激烈的争论。所以会场中始终保持着一种友好的气氛。
    在会议中提出来的意见，大概就是这些。这些意见虽然和我们的意见有很大的分歧，甚至有原则性的区别，但彼此交换一下，还是有好处的。因为大家都可以由此知道还有那些和我自己不同的意见存在于天地之间。
    除此以外，在个别的交谈中还听到一些意见。例如美国贺浦金斯大学教授拉铁摩尔提出我国史学家在划分历史阶段时，过于忽视文化艺术方面的反映，是一个缺点。法国汉学家白乐日教授提出我们对近代史的分期分得太细，历史不可能在短短的几年中就能发生划时期的变化。荷兰的汉学家何四维教授提出我国有些史学家不但按照西洋史划分中国史的阶段，甚至每一阶段的起讫时期，都力求与西洋史一致，他认为这是教条主义。我以为这些意见还是值得我们参考的。
    总起来说：我们在这次会议中收获不少。我们的收获不仅是听到了对中国历史分期问题的各种意见，还有我们和世界各国汉学家之间的友谊。这种友谊对于我们今后和各国汉学家在学术研究中的合作是一种最好的保证。
    中法两国学者的友谊
    在这里，我想提到的是法国的汉学家。法国的汉学家对待我们是友好的，他们在任何场合都没有忘记把我们当作是法国学者们最尊贵的客人。在开幕的致词中，在闭幕的宴会中，在巴黎市长的招待酒会中，我们都能体会到我们法国朋友的这种友谊。
    法国的老汉学家德密微院士就非常关心中国的文字改革。他在为了欢迎我们而举行的宴会中谈到这个问题，称赞我们在文字改革过程中所采取的“稳步前进”的办法。应该附带说一下，还有很多汉学家关心这个问题。一般说，他们赞成拉丁化，不赞成简体字，因为简体字替他们增加麻烦。
    研究元史和中国近代史的李嘉乐教授，就不能忘记他在北京的日子。正像我们不能忘记塞因河岸的旧书摊一样，他也不能忘记琉璃厂的旧书铺，因为这旧书摊好像是一个有文化传统的城市的标志。
    研究中国文学和戏剧的于儒伯教授，对中国的京剧感到很大的兴趣。当中国京剧团在巴黎演出时，他写了很多赞扬的评论。
    研究中国考古的叶理夫教授，对新中国考古发现的丰富大加赞叹。他认为这样大规模的发掘，是对人类文化的巨大贡献。他和他的朋友管理全法国博物馆事业的萨尔先生并且欢迎中国的考古学家参加法国的发掘工作。
    应该提到的是我去年在莱顿会议中会到的一位法国朋友，研究宋史的白乐日教授。大家都关心我和他的友谊，因为我们去年在莱顿会议中曾经进行过激烈的论战。但是我们的友谊并没有因为争论而受到损害。当我到达巴黎的时候，白乐日教授还是以很友谊的态度欢迎他去年的论敌。
    除了汉学家以外，我们也不能忘记另外的一些法国朋友——法国的史学家。
    巴黎大学文学院长、法国有名的史学家勒鲁文院士希望我国史学家为他主编的“历史杂志”撰文，特别希望撰写一篇介绍中国历史研究情况的论文。
    法国最高的研究机关法兰西学院的教授施伐列也希望我国史学家为他所主编的“近代现代史杂志”撰文。施伐列教授是有名的巴黎史专家，他对巴黎这个城市发展的历史进行过极其细致的研究。他引导我们参观了残存在巴黎而至今尚被利用的巴黎的十六、七世纪的房屋和街道，几乎对于每一栋古老的房子都能叙述出它的历史。此外，他还引导我们参观了巴黎公社的起义地点——手工业工人聚居区。
    巴黎大学教授、优秀的马克思主义史学家布鲁瓦和谢诺很热情地引导我们去访问巴黎公社的遗迹和蒙塔勒依历史博物馆。谢诺教授和他的朋友中国佛教史专家日和耐教授，并引导我们去访问了巴黎近郊的美丽的法国农村。
    这些法国的教授，不管是马克思主义者或非马克思主义者，他们都有一个共同的愿望，这就是恢复北京和巴黎的政治和文化的正常关系。
    还应该提到的是我所接触到的法国青年，特别是研究汉学的青年，他们对新中国是向往的、友好的。他们和他们的前辈一样，希望通过我们把他们的友谊带给中国的青年。
    此外法国科学研究中心的负责人杜布伊先生也向我们表示希望在科学研究方面和我国合作；法国教育部高等教育司司长贝尔热先生、副司长巴叶先生在他为我们举行的酒会中也向我们表示，希望和我国交换学生和教授。
    作为中国的一个教授，我们欢迎法国学者们的这种友谊，并且珍重这种友谊。我们希望在这种友谊的基础上进一步发展我们在文化学术方面的友好合作，在新的历史基础上恢复中法两国的正常关系。
