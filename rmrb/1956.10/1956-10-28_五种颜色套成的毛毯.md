    Blanket Woven with Five Colors
    (By our dispatch) In mid-September, the Sichuan Wutongqiao Chuan Kang Wool Textile Factory successfully trial-produced a batch of new varieties of blankets. This batch of blankets has a total of ten different patterns. Some are printed with oleanders woven with five colors, and some are printed with red-spotted goldfish and white geese swimming in a lotus pond. The patterns are novel and the colors are bright. Now, samples of these new blankets have been sent to the Ministry of Textile Industry in Beijing, and after quality appraisal, they can be mass-produced.
