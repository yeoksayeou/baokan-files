    Joyfully Seeing the Yangtze River
    Chen Zhen
    Joyfully seeing the Yangtze River, waves patting the blue sky.
    I remember the fragrant rice blossoms of August, when
    I bid farewell to Jiangnan to go to the Inner Mongolian grasslands.
    Young people are determined to travel far,
    Going to the frontier for five or six years;
    Ambition is like the Yangtze River, flowing ten thousand miles away.
    A girl saw me off with tears in her eyes,
    Waving her handkerchief by the great river.
    Thirstily drinking the Yangtze River water,
    The water of my hometown is even sweeter.
    Tractors roared in the wind by the river,
    Spraying planes swept over the boundless cotton fields.
    I wanted to praise the frontier,
    But my hometown is ahead;
    After returning to the frontier,
    Galloping horses will be spurred on again.
    The girl smiled and whispered:
    Whoever has the greatest determination wins!

    喜见长江水
    陈震喜见长江水，浪花拍蓝天。记得当年稻花飘香八月间，辞别江南奔赴内蒙大草原。青年决心要远行，一去边疆五六年；壮志如江水，奔流万里远。姑娘含泪来相送，手帕挥舞大江边。渴饮长江水，故乡水更甜。江边拖拉机迎风吼叫，喷药飞机掠过无边棉田。有心想把边疆夸，无奈故乡走在前；回到边疆后，快马再加鞭。姑娘抿嘴轻声笑：决心谁大谁占先！
