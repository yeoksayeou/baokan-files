    Mr. Lu Xun at Xiamen University
    Wú Fǎng
    Mr. Lu Xun arrived at Xiamen University in September 1926 and left Xiamen for Guangzhou in January of the following year. His actual time at Xiamen University was one semester. It seems that the details of Mr. Lu Xun's work and life during this period are not as clear to everyone as those in Shaoxing, Japan, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shanghai. This article mainly mentions the general situation of Mr. Lu Xun's teaching and writing at Xiamen University, and other aspects are omitted.
    Mr. Lu Xun taught three courses at Xiamen University: Chinese Literary History, History of Chinese Novels, and Research on Chinese Phonology, Writing, and Exegesis. The last course was not actually taught. At that time, not only students from the Chinese department but also students from other departments attended his lectures. The classroom was packed, with some people standing against the wall, including several female students. Among the students known today are: Wang Fangren, Cui Zhenwu, Zhu Fei, and Chen Mengshao. Wang and Cui were both from Zhejiang and later followed Mr. Lu Xun to Guangzhou and Shanghai, where they participated in the founding of Morning Flower Society and published woodcut selections.
    At that time, the teaching unit was the Department of Chinese Studies in the Faculty of Arts. There was also the Institute of Chinese Studies, which was also headed by professors from the Faculty of Arts. Mr. Lu Xun's colleagues included Shen Jianshi, Luo Changpei, Zhang Xinglang, Ding Shan, Lin Yutang, Gu Jiegang, and Sun Fuyuan. The president of Xiamen University at that time was Lin Wenqing. In addition, people who had contact with Mr. Lu Xun included Ai Efeng, a German professor in the Philosophy Department, who presented Mr. Lu Xun with his own works, and Mr. Lu Xun also presented him with an English translation of "The True Story of Ah Q." There was also a Buddhist monk named Taixu, who was the abbot of Nanputuo Temple near Xiamen University.
    The lecture notes for Chinese Literary History compiled by Mr. Lu Xun at Xiamen University are the "A Brief History of Chinese Literature" published later. These lecture notes were slightly revised when he taught at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou. As for the History of Chinese Novels, which he taught at Xiamen University, he used the original text from the already published "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction" and distributed it as mimeographed copies.
    Although this period of time was not very long, Mr. Lu Xun wrote a considerable amount. In addition to compiling lecture notes, Mr. Lu Xun's writings at Xiamen University included: the historical novels "Forging the Sword" and "奔月 (Running to the Moon)" (later included in "Old Tales Retold"); the memoir essays "From the Hundred Herb Garden to the Private School" and other five pieces (later included in "Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk"); essays "The Cause of the True Story of Ah Q" and "Correspondence from Xiamen" and other seven pieces (later included in "More Than Just a Collection"); inscriptions such as the "Preface" and "Postscript to More Than Just a Collection," and the "Inscription" and "Postscript" to "Grave" and other four pieces; forty letters included in "Two Places"; a daily diary entry for each day, totaling one hundred and thirty-five entries (see "Lu Xun's Diary"); and one hundred and forty letters written to friends (a portion of which was later included in "Lu Xun's Letters"). However, the actual amount of writing was even more than this. Currently, what can be verified are: an article "A Study of Ji Kang's Collection" (published in the first issue of Xiamen University's Guoxue Journal); a "Preface to the Play 'Jiangdong Flower Master'" (the original manuscript is now in the possession of Mr. Chen Mengshao of Xiamen University); about three lecture manuscripts at Jimei School and other places; an article about agave (published in the Xiamen University student group's publication "Wave Boat," issue number unknown), etc. These texts do not seem to have been included in the "Complete Works of Lu Xun." There is also "Compilation of Statues of the Six Dynasties," the original manuscript of which, along with "Gou Chen of Ancient Novels," was handed over to the Guoxue Institute for publication, but it did not come to fruition. This compilation also does not seem to have been included in the "Complete Works of Lu Xun."
    At that time, two publications were published by student groups at Xiamen University and proofread by Mr. Lu Xun: "Wave Boat," a monthly magazine, and "Gulang," a weekly magazine. It is now known that Mr. Lu Xun first published "Forging the Sword" in the first issue of "Wave Boat" under the title "Meijian Chi." According to what has been learned, Mr. Lu Xun may have had other writings published in these two publications. However, due to the turmoil in between, the books at Xiamen University were moved once, so publications of magazines and journals suffered significant losses. Publications such as "Wave Boat," which were originally collected by the Xiamen University Library, are now very difficult to find. The "Gulang Weekly" was attached to the Xiamen Minzhong Daily, so if the bound volume of that newspaper from that time can be found, some things may be discovered. Additionally, several speeches by Mr. Lu Xun were published in the school publications of Xiamen University, which should not be difficult to find.
    In addition, when Mr. Lu Xun was about to leave Xiamen University, there was a disturbance at Xiamen University (related to students requesting the school authorities to retain Mr. Lu Xun). At that time, newspapers in Fuzhou and Xiamen reported on this matter in lengthy articles, which involved Mr. Lu Xun. It is said that Mr. Lu Xun once went to the Xiamen Minzhong Daily to request a correction. Being able to find this record would also be helpful in understanding Mr. Lu Xun's life at that time. As for Mr. Lu Xun's colleagues at Xiamen University, it is said that they have letters from Mr. Lu Xun. We hope that everyone will bring out these precious writings and make them available to the people!
    Xiamen University has a Lu Xun Memorial Room, which is a room on the upper floor of Jimei Building where Mr. Lu Xun once lived. Many of Mr. Lu Xun's works in Xiamen were written in this room. It is very spacious, with a desk by the window, a bed against the right wall, and a coffee table and reclining chair in the middle. The arrangement is preserved in its original state. Outside the room is a stone railing, from which one can see the mountains and waters in the distance. From the window of the room, one can see Nanputuo Temple. This is the place where the sound of the puppet show gongs and drums was heard, as mentioned in the postscript to "Grave." Mr. Lu Xun once paced along the corridor downstairs on a moonlit night.
    Mr. Lu Xun took more than one photo at Xiamen University. Two are verifiable: one is a group photo taken with all the faculty members of Xiamen University at that time; the other is a single photo of Mr. Lu Xun sitting on a tomb on barren land, surrounded by agave and weeds.

    鲁迅先生在厦门大学
    无仿
    鲁迅先生于1926年9月到厦大，至次年1月离开厦门到广州去。实际在厦大的时间为一个学期。关于这一段时间的鲁迅先生的工作、生活的情况，似乎远不及在绍兴、日本、北京、广州、上海等地方更为大家所清楚。这里主要只提鲁迅先生在厦大的教学和写作的大体情况，其它的从略。
    鲁迅先生在厦大所开的课程共三门：一为中国文学史，一为中国小说史，一为中国声韵文字训诂研究。最后一门实际未开讲。当时听讲的学生，不但有本系的，而且有外系的。上课时教室挤满了人，有的是倚墙而立的，其中包括女生数人。今日所知道的学生中有：王方仁、崔真吾、朱斐、陈梦韶等。王、崔二位是浙江同乡，后来跟鲁迅先生到过广州，并且到过上海，参加创办朝花社，出版过木刻选。
    当时教学的单位是文科国学系。另外有国学研究院，亦由文科的先生主持。和鲁迅先生一起的同事有：沈兼士、罗常培、张星烺、丁山、林语堂、顾颉刚、孙伏园等人。这时厦门大学的校长为林文庆。另外，和鲁迅先生接触过的人物，有艾锷风，是德国人，任哲学系教授，他赠与鲁迅先生以自己的著作，鲁迅先生亦赠他以英译的阿Q正传。还有一个太虚和尚，是厦大附近南普陀寺的住持。
    鲁迅先生在厦大所编写的中国文学史的讲稿，即是后来出版的“汉文学史纲要”。这讲稿，在广州中山大学上课时，似略加修改。至于在厦大所讲的中国小说史，那是用的已经出版的中国小说史略上的原文，加以油印分发的。
    虽然这一段的时间并不很长，但鲁迅先生写作的数量却是不少的。除了编写讲义以外，鲁迅先生在厦大所写成的文字，计有：历史小说铸剑、奔月两篇（后来编入故事新编）；回忆散文从百草园到三味书屋等五篇（后来编入朝华夕拾）；杂文阿Q正传的成因和厦门通信等七篇（后来编入华盖集续编）；题记如华盖集续编的小引和校讫记，坟的题记和后记等四篇；编入两地书的通信四十篇；日记每日一则共一百三十五则（见鲁迅日记）；写给友人的信一百四十封（后来一部分似编入鲁迅书简）。但实际上的写作文字，尚不止此。现在可考的有：嵇康集考一篇（发表在厦大国学第一期）；绛洞花主剧本小引一篇（原手稿今存厦大陈梦韶先生处）；在集美学校及其它地方的演讲稿约三篇；关于龙舌兰的文字一篇（发表在厦大学生团体的刊物波艇第某期）等等，以上文字似未编入鲁迅全集。另有六朝造像汇编一种，当时原稿连同古小说钩沉交与国学院付印，未果。这一汇编，似亦未曾编入鲁迅全集。
    当时由厦大学生团体出版，经鲁迅先生校阅的两种刊物：一为波艇，一为鼓浪。前为月刊，后为周刊。现在已经知道的，鲁迅先生曾将铸剑一篇，最先发表在波艇第一期上，题为眉间尺。据了解所得，鲁迅先生可能还有其它的文字发表在这两种刊物上。但是因为中间经过动乱，厦大的图书一度迁移，所以属于杂志刊物一类的，丧失独多。本来厦大图书馆收藏的刊物如波艇，目前已经很难找到了。至鼓浪周刊系附在厦门民钟日报发行，如果找到这个报纸的当时合订本，可能会发见一些东西。其它在厦大的校刊上登载有鲁迅先生的几次演讲词，这是不难找到的吧。
    另外，当鲁迅先生快要离开厦大的时候，厦大曾经闹起一次风潮（和学生请求学校当局挽留鲁迅先生有关）。这时的福州、厦门两地的报纸，曾以较长的篇幅报道此事，中间涉及鲁迅先生。听说鲁迅先生一度亲到厦门的民钟日报社，请求更正。关于这一项记载，能够寻拣出来，也是对理解鲁迅先生当时生活的情况有帮助的。至于鲁迅先生在厦大的同事们，听说留有鲁迅先生的函札。我们希望大家把这些可贵的笔墨拿出来公诸人民吧！
    厦门大学现有鲁迅纪念室一所，是将鲁迅先生曾经住过的集美楼上一间房子辟成的。鲁迅先生在厦门的许多作品，即在此房子内所写。它很宽敞，靠窗设一书桌，靠右墙设一床位，中间是茶几和躺椅，这陈设的样子系保留当时实际的情况。房外有石栏杆，可以远眺山光水色。房内窗口可以望见南普陀寺，在“坟”后记中所说的听到牵丝傀儡戏的锣鼓声的，即是这个地方。楼下的走廊上，鲁迅先生曾经月夜在此徘徊。
    鲁迅先生在厦大拍过不止一张的照片。可考的有二张，一为团体照，和当时厦大全体教员合摄的；一为单身照，鲁迅先生坐在荒地的坟台上，四围是龙舌兰和野草。
