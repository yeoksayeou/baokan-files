Xinhua News Agency, London, October 20th (TASS dispatch) – The council of the "Suez Canal Users Association" recently met in London to discuss the executive group's recommendations regarding the establishment of the "Association" and various issues related to the "Association's" exercise of its functions.

    The communique issued yesterday announced that the council decided to appoint Evan Bartels, the Danish Consul General in New York, as the administrative head of the "Association."

    According to a report by Reuters, the council of the "Association" decided to open two bank accounts in London: one account for administrative income and expenditure, and the other, it is presumed, is for the "Association's" member states' ships to pay Suez Canal transit fees.

    It is understood that London will serve as the center of the "Association's" activities until a permanent address for the "Association" is determined.

    “运河使用国协会”继续进行非法活动
    新华社20日讯　塔斯社伦敦20日讯：“苏伊士运河使用国协会”理事会最近在伦敦开会，讨论执行小组关于成立“协会”和“协会”行使职能各种问题的建议。
    昨天所发表的公报中宣布，理事会决定任命丹麦驻纽约总领事埃文·巴特尔斯为“协会”行政负责人。
    据报联社报道，“协会”理事会决定在伦敦开两个银行账户：一个账户是行政收支费用，而另一个，据推测，是供“协会”会员国船只缴纳苏伊士运河通航费用的。
    据悉，在“协会”常设地址没有确定以前，伦敦将作为“协会”活动的中心。
