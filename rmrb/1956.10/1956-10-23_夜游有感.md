    Reflections on a Night Excursion
    Ye Qu
    On the evening of National Day, I took a boat borrowed from the comrades of the West Lake Agricultural Production Cooperative to enjoy the fireworks and water parade. We disembarked at "Flower Harbor Viewing Fish" and rowed towards the brightly lit lakeside.
    The wind stirred up small waves. The sky was ink black, with only a few stars twinkling. The lake seemed vast, the water unfathomable, and the lakeside seemed distant. Two comrades and I rowed the boat, and after much rowing, we finally rounded the edge of "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon" and gradually saw what must have been the lights of the gathered tourist boats floating on the water, close to the lakeside.
    We rowed towards the pier, which was crowded with tourists. People pushed and shoved, creating a commotion, eager to squeeze past the iron railings and stand on the water to watch the fireworks. This prompted the police officers to patiently advise everyone not to push any further. We had originally wanted to go ashore to see the lakeside night market, but the overwhelming crowds forced us to abandon the idea of going ashore and instead decided to row away from the pier and further out into the lake. We rowed to a spot on the lake far from the lakeside pier and tied the boat to a bamboo stake. We propped the oars at the bow and hung a safety red lantern high on the oars. Although we were far from the pier, the noise of the crowd still reached us like the roaring tide of the Qiantang River, wave after wave.
    Colored sparks shot into the sky and drifted down, some people cheering and some shouting. The water parade began. After a while, our boat was surrounded by many brightly lit and decorated tourist boats, and it felt as if our boat was moving with the tourist boats coming from all directions. Only after the tourist boats had gone far away and the sky still had only a few stars did we realize that our boat, although it had turned around many times, was still tied to the bamboo stake. The comrades were all very satisfied with this night excursion.
    We returned and disembarked at "Flower Harbor Viewing Fish" again, already past midnight. We passed through West Hill Park, and on the winding paths were pairs of young men and women, some of whom looked very young, no more than fourteen or fifteen years old.
    "Oh! There are still people out at this hour! And so young!" I was a little surprised.
    "Hmm! Don't you know! Every Sunday night is like this, and even more so in the summer! This is the result of opposing feudalism!" one of the comrades said to me with a smile.
    "But isn't it too early for these children to be in love?" I said. I have always had this thought: while advocating for freedom of love and autonomy in marriage, we should also educate young people about the two sexes, so that they understand that this matter can affect not only their own lives but also society. Seeing the pairs of young men and women, this thought came to me again, and I was reminded of another incident.
    I remember around this time last year, a publication asked me for a manuscript, and I wrote a short note about visiting a certain production cooperative, in which I mentioned a female cooperative member who came to me to discuss her marriage. I told her my thoughts: that getting married too early could hinder a woman's own studies and work, and that a woman should also think about her original work position when getting married. I don't know why the editor of this publication deleted this entire passage, turning it into an article that was disjointed and completely lacking the author's own thoughts and opinions. I often think: we should tell young people the truth, the reality, so that they understand these kinds of things and their own vested interests. Am I wrong to think this way? Or is it because these words are too unappealing to the psychology of young people?

    夜游有感
    野渠
    国庆日的晚上，我坐了西湖农业生产合作社里同志们所借的一只船，去欣赏焰火和水上游行。我们在“花港观鱼”下船，向着灯火辉煌的湖滨划去。
    风吹起了小小的浪。天空是墨黑的，只有两三星星闪烁着。湖面显得辽阔了，湖水显得深不可测了，湖滨呢，显得遥远了。我们两个同志划着船，划呀划的，终于绕过“三潭印月”的边，渐渐地望见了浮在水上的该是群集着的游船灯光，贴着湖滨。
    我们划向码头，码头上挤满了游人，人们拥来挤去，闹成一片，恨不得挤到铁栏干外，站到水上来看焰火。引得人民警察只好耐心地劝告大家不能再往外挤了。我们原想上岸去看看湖滨的夜市，这个气势使我们只得把上岸的念头打消了，并且决定离开码头划到湖滨之外去。我们划到远离湖滨码头的湖上，把船拴在一根毛竹桩上。我们把桨撑在船头，把一盏安全红灯高高地挂在桨上。虽然已经远离码头，人声却还像钱塘江里的浪潮一样，轰然地一阵一阵地送来。
    彩色的火星冲上天空又飘下来，有些人欢呼着，有些人喊叫着。水上游行开始了。一歇后，我们的船便被包围在许多挂灯结彩的游船当中，我们的船好像跟着四面八方来的游船动着。直到游船都已远去，天空依然只有几点星星，我们才觉得我们的船虽然转了许多身，却还拴住在毛竹桩上。同志们都很满意这样的夜游。
    回来，仍旧在“花港观鱼”上岸，已经是半夜了。我们经过西山公园，曲径上有一对对青年男女，有的显得很年青，看起来不过十四、五岁。
    “呀！这个时候还有人！这么年青的人！”我有些吃惊。
      “嗯！你不知道！每个星期天晚上都是这样的，夏天还要多！这是反封建的成绩！”一个同志笑着对我说。
      “可是这些小孩子谈恋爱是不是太早了呢？”我说。我心里一直有这个思想：在恋爱自由、婚姻自主的同时，应当向青年进行两性的教育，使青年明白这件事情不仅可以关系到自己的一生，也关系到社会。看到一对对青年男女，我的这个思想又来了，并且联想起另外一件事。
    记得去年这时，有一个刊物向我约稿，我写了一篇访问某一个生产合作社的小记，里面我谈到一个女社员来和我商量她的婚姻问题，我告诉她我的想法：以为结婚太早对于女人自己的学习和工作有些妨碍，一个女人结婚也应当想到自己原来的工作岗位。不知道为什么这个刊物的编辑先生把我这一段话全删去了，变成了一篇上下不接、完全没有作者自己思想和主见的文章。我常常想：应当对青年人讲老实话，讲现实话，让他们明白像这一类事情和自己切身的利害关系。难道我这样想是错的么？或者是因为这些话太不迎合青年人的心理么？
