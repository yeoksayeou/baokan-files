    The Political Situation in Italy
    Renzo Laconi, Secretary of the Parliamentary Group of the Italian Communist Party
    An observer who only superficially examines Italian events might have the impression that everything has been stable in our country for several years, and that our political situation is in a state of stagnation. In reality, beneath this surface of stagnation, a massive and profound transformation is taking place in Italy, the decisive reasons for which are: first, the new international situation; second, the impetus of the masses of people and public opinion.
    Since 1945, the Christian Democratic Party has been the leading force in successive Italian governments, and it also holds a considerable majority in both houses of parliament. This party belongs to the ranks of European Catholic parties, which, under the leadership of the Vatican, are active supporters of the Atlantic Alliance and proponents of the Cold War policy against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. At times, the Italian Christian Democratic Party even harbored ambitious plans to become the leader of a true Catholic International, which would rule almost all of Western Europe, unified through the European Defence Community, to serve the Vatican and the United States of America.
    Therefore, the failure of the European Defence Community plan, the crisis of the Atlantic Alliance, and the easing of international tensions naturally have a profound impact on this party and the alliance system that has enabled it to rule our country in recent years.
    Social Democratic parties in some European countries, which have not compromised excessively with the policies of the Atlantic Alliance, have replaced Catholic parties in power. In West Germany, even the position of Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union has shown significant wavering. However, in Italy, the strength of the Social Democratic Party (led by Saragat) is weak, and most of the strength of the Socialists is fighting under the banner of the Italian Socialist Party (led by Nenni), which is a left-wing party allied with the Communist Party.
    Therefore, it is no wonder that in recent months the Socialist International has been paying increasingly close attention to the situation in Italy, and is now redoubling its efforts to establish the basis for a common political program between the Italian Social Democratic Party and the Italian Socialist Party, in order to form a unified Social Democratic political organization in Italy as well, to replace the Christian Democratic Party, or to be able to govern the country jointly with the Christian Democratic Party with the help of the left-wing trend in Italy.
    Undoubtedly, the leading groups of European Social Democracy have devised this strategy with anti-people and anti-unity goals, they merely want to give the Italian bourgeoisie the possibility of "shifting its gun from one shoulder to the other."
    However, in Italy, the problem appears more complex. It is by no means accidental that the Social Democratic Party has always been a small party in Italy, while the Italian Socialist Party has become a large mass party. Nor is it accidental, or due to the wishes of certain leaders, that the Italian Socialist Party has consistently had a progressive political program and has been allied with the Communist Party for many years.
    The fact is that there has always been a strong desire in Italy among the working class and the masses of people for the socialist forces to unite. The workers and the people have given strength to the united parties, and have isolated certain leaders of the Social Democratic Party who attempted to split the working class and serve the bourgeoisie.
    Therefore, in Italy, there is an impetus from the masses of the people and public opinion, which is driving the progress of the situation, but at the same time, the direction of this transformation is completely different from what the Italian bourgeoisie and the Socialist International hope for.
    The Italian working class and the masses of people are fully in favor of the unity of the socialists, but they will never allow this unity to mean the rupture of the fraternal relationship of unity in action that has been established between the Communists and Socialists for many years, a relationship that has played a decisive role in defeating fascism, establishing a democratic republic, ensuring democracy, and defending peace. On the contrary, they want the unity of the socialists to become a further expansion of the democratic, peace, and social progress front, so that a strong political organization can be formed in Italy, one that can lead the Italian people towards the full realization of the democratic constitution, towards the peaceful realization of socialism.
    The working class and the Italian people are watching the test facing all Italian and foreign advocates of socialist unity. The content of this test is not words but facts, first and foremost a clear political program, on which all those who truly love democracy, peace, and socialism should undertake their common struggle obligations.
    For the true friends of the working class and the people, the first topic forming this test is the issue of political democracy. Italy has a constitution that is permeated with the spirit of democracy; this constitution was adopted by all parties in 1948 under the impetus of the people's struggle against fascism and for national liberation. However, in recent years, the Christian Democratic Party and the governments it has led have trampled on all the principles of the constitution, and have reintroduced a whole set of measures that discriminate against the working class and the people, as well as the most progressive democratic parties. In addition, the Christian Democratic Party and its governments have prevented the implementation of all constitutional provisions regarding the reform of state institutions, reforms that would allow residents to enjoy expanded local autonomy, and would allow the democratization of the central government institutions.
    Obviously, the first point of a political program that attempts to achieve national progress should be to restore democratic legitimacy, fully and completely respect the rights and freedoms of citizens and their organizations, and implement democratic reforms of the state.
    In addition, there is a series of questions that can be used to measure the sincerity of all those who advocate democracy and socialism; this is the issue of economic and social systems. Although the Italian constitution is a bourgeois democratic constitution, it stipulates the implementation of some basic reforms regarding the economic and political structure of the country. In particular, it stipulates the confiscation of large estates, the distribution of land to peasants, and the nationalization of large industrial conglomerates, especially those with a monopoly. In recent years, successive governments led by the Christian Democratic Party have tried to deceive the peasants by distributing meager amounts of land to them, land that is completely unable to meet their needs, while at the same time burdening them with heavy taxes, rendering their gains worthless. On the other hand, successive governments have not only failed to carry out any nationalization of industrial enterprises, but have instead agreed to allow monopoly capitalists to direct the country's entire economic life.
    Therefore, it is clear that the second point of a common program of socialist forces should be a grand plan for economic and social reforms, reforms that will eliminate all remnants of feudalism in Italy, and overthrow the power of the monopolistic big bourgeoisie.
    Finally, there is a third point, which concerns foreign policy and international relations. The Italian people have suffered deeply because of the Second World War launched by the fascist forces, and they deeply desire peace and cooperation with the people of all countries around the world. And in fact, only peace and cooperation can provide new markets for Italian goods, and make it possible to send technicians and workers abroad to work under good conditions; only peace and cooperation can allow it to improve its living standards through necessary economic and social reforms; only peace and cooperation can allow it to ensure that the artistic and cultural heritage it has created over many centuries will not be destroyed, and allow it to continue to make its contribution to the progress of all mankind in all fields of science, art, and culture.
    For this reason, the constitution that was drafted and adopted in Italy shortly after its liberation from fascist rule states: Italy rejects war as an instrument of aggression against the freedom of other peoples and as a means of resolving international disputes.
    However, in reality, even this constitutional principle has been violated by successive Christian Democratic Party-led governments. In fact, shortly after the constitution was adopted, they began to plot a massive conspiracy to tie Italy to the chariot of aggressive policies. The Christian Democratic governments are active supporters of the Atlantic Pact and the Cold War against the Soviet Union, the European People's Democratic countries, and the Asian and African countries that have achieved national independence.
    Italy has thus been drawn into all the actions led by the United States that have sharpened the international situation in recent years, violating the will of the Italian people, devoting most of its meager resources to military affairs, and allowing foreigners to use military bases within its territory, placing its peace and security in danger.
    The most conscious and active part of the working class and the Italian people has fought against this policy of successive Christian Democratic Party governments, and has achieved great victories. The plan to establish the European Defence Community suffered a shameful defeat, the Atlantic Pact experienced a crisis, and a prominent Italian figure publicly proposed for the first time in the United States the necessity of revising this pact; all this was due to the great struggle waged by the Italian people, led by the working class, against the policy of war, and clearly expressing their will to defend peace and national independence.
    However, it is also a fact that until now Italy has not had a positive policy of advocating peace and cooperation with all countries. This fact is due to the fact that although the Christian Democratic Party is aware of the people's aversion to the policy of war, and aware of the people's will to achieve full national independence, it still maintains its close ties with the American imperialist bloc, and has no intention of faithfully serving the interests of the country.
    For example, it is undoubtedly only because the Italian government closely follows American policy that Italy has not yet officially recognized the People's Republic of China, although not only the working class but the entire people are paying close attention to the liberation movement of this great people with deep sympathy, and are watching with deep admiration its efforts for progress, for peace in Asia and the world.
    The Italian people also watch with deep sympathy the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa to achieve their national independence, especially the actions taken in recent years by the Egyptian government to break the last link in the chain of imperialism that has bound it for so long.
    The Italian people, after a tenacious mass struggle, only achieved unification and independence not long before a century ago, and they have always been disgusted by the few sinful colonialist adventures into which the bourgeoisie dragged them before and during the twenty years of fascist rule. They perhaps understand better than any other European people the greatness and nobility of the liberation movement carried out by the people of Asia and Africa, a movement that frees them from slavery and promotes their active participation in the struggle of all progressive humanity for peace and progress.
    Therefore, there is no doubt that the Christian Democratic Party government's policy towards the People's Republic of China and towards other Asian and African countries that have recently gained independence, as well as its recent hesitant and ambiguous attitude towards the Egyptian question, is not at all in line with the wishes of the Italian people.
    Therefore, for those who claim to be expressing the true interests and deep desires of the working class and the Italian people, foreign policy is also a test, perhaps the main test.
    Today, the international atmosphere has clearly eased: new countries have appeared on the world stage, changing the balance of power between countries, and new relations between countries are being established. The aversion to war and the desire for peace are prompting the vast masses of people around the world to struggle.
    Therefore, any change in our country's internal political lineup should be viewed with approval, a change that means the expansion of the democratic, peace, and socialist front, because it can lead to the formation of a new majority in parliament and in the country, and lead to the establishment of a government that includes all progressive forces and begins a new policy on domestic and international issues.
    To be honest, those who hope to undermine the unity of the Italian working class, isolate the Communist Party, in order to form a force that can serve the Italian bourgeoisie in continuing to implement the old policies under a new mask are greatly mistaken.
    The working class and the Italian people have victoriously waged the anti-fascist struggle, and have continuously waged the struggle for democracy, progress, and peace. Now they will defend with all their strength the unity they have achieved through long and tenacious efforts.
    Expanding this unity, extending it to all social strata with democratic views, is the intention of the most progressive forces among the working class and the Italian people. In the struggle for peace, freedom, and progress, all sincere patriots have a place. The Republic's constitution provides a basis for coexistence and cooperation for all parties, and it is itself the basis of a political program on which all parties linked to the people can reach their agreements.
    Therefore, Italy may potentially advance along the path of peace towards socialism in the next few years. We Communists will all do our duty with the spirit of love for our motherland and the ideals of proletarian internationalism. The lofty example given to all Communists and democrats in the world by the great Chinese Communist Party in the struggle for national liberation, for the peaceful establishment of socialism, and for peace and cooperation between countries and between peoples, as well as the examples given to us by our socialist comrades and the People's Democratic countries, will be an encouragement and constant help to us.

    意大利的政治局势
    意大利共产党议会党团书记　伦佐·拉科尼
    一个只限于浮浅地考查意大利事件的观察家会有这样一种印象：在我国几年以来一切都是稳定的，我们的政治局势处于一种停滞不动的状态中。实际上，在这种表面的停滞状态下，一个巨大而深刻的转变正在意大利进行着，其决定性的原因是：一，国际的新局势；二，人民群众和舆论的推动力。
    天主教民主党自从1945年到今天一直是意大利历届政府的领导力量，并且在议会两院还拥有相当的多数；这个党属于欧洲天主教政党之列，这些政党在梵蒂冈领导下，都是大西洋联盟的积极拥护者，也是对苏联和人民民主国家冷战政策的拥护者。在某些时候，意大利天主教民主党甚至还曾怀着这样野心勃勃的计划：进而成为一个真正天主教国际的领袖，这个天主教国际是要统治通过欧洲防务集团统一起来的差不多整个西欧，以服务于梵蒂冈和美利坚合众国。
    因此，欧洲防务集团计划的失败，大西洋联盟的危机，以及国际紧张局势的趋于缓和，自然而然地都会对这一政党以及对于使它能在近几年中统治我国的那个联盟体系具有深刻的影响。
    有一些欧洲国家的社会民主党没有向大西洋联盟的政策作过分妥协，这些社会民主党已经代替天主教政党执政；在西德，阿登纳的基督教民主联盟的地位甚至于显出了显著的动摇。不过，在意大利，社会民主党（萨拉盖特领导的政党）的力量很薄弱，大部分社会党人的力量都站在意大利社会党（南尼领导的政党）的旗帜下进行斗争，而社会党却是一个和共产党联合的左翼政党。
    所以，无怪乎最近几个月以来社会民主党国际越来越注意地考虑意大利的局势，在这几天正在加倍努力建立意大利社会民主党和意大利社会党之间的共同政治纲领的基础，以便在意大利也成立一个统一的社会民主的政治组织，来代替天主教民主党，或者能够借助于意大利的左翼潮流，和天主教民主党共同统治这一国家。
    毫无疑问，欧洲社会民主党的领导集团想出这种行动策略是具有反人民反团结的目的的，他们只是想给与意大利资产阶级以“把它的枪从这一肩上换到另一肩上”的可能性。
    不过，在意大利，问题显得更为复杂。在意大利，社会民主党一直是个小党，而意大利社会党则已变成了一个群众性的大党，这决不是偶然的。意大利社会党一直有进步的政治纲领并且多年以来和共产党联盟，这既不是偶然的，也不是由于某些领导者的愿望而如是的。
    事实是这样：在意大利一直存在着工人阶级和人民群众要求社会主义者力量团结起来的强烈愿望，工人和人民已经给了团结起来的各政党以力量，而使社会民主党的某些企图分裂工人阶级而为资产阶级服务的领导者处于孤立地位。
    所以，在意大利存在着人民群众的和舆论的推动力，这种推动力推动了局势的进展，但是，同时这种转变的方向却和意大利资产阶级和社会民主党国际所希望的完全不同。
    意大利工人阶级和人民群众是完全赞成社会主义者的统一的，但是他们决不允许这种统一意味着共产党人和社会党人之间多年以来建立的兄弟般的行动一致的关系的破裂，这种关系对于击败法西斯主义，对于建立民主共和国，对于保障民主及保卫和平都起了决定性的作用。相反地，他们愿意社会主义者的统一成为民主、和平和社会进步阵线的进一步扩大，使得在意大利能够形成一个强大的政治组织，这个政治组织能够领导意大利人民向着充分实现民主宪法，向着和平实现社会主义的方向走去。
    工人阶级和意大利人民正在注视着对所有意大利的和外国的赞助社会主义者统一的人们所面临的考验。这种考验的内容不是言论而是事实，首先是一个明确的政治纲领，在这个纲领上所有真正爱好民主、和平和社会主义的人们都应承担他们共同的斗争义务。
    对于工人阶级的和人民的真正朋友，形成这个考验的第一个题目就是政治民主的问题。意大利有一部贯彻着民主精神的宪法；这部宪法是在人民反对法西斯、争取国家解放的斗争的动力下，于1948年被所有各政党通过的。不过，这几年来天主教民主党和它所领导的政府践踏了宪法的一切准则，重新实行了整整一大套歧视工人阶级和人民以及最前进的民主党派的措施。此外，天主教民主党和它的政府还阻止了宪法所规定的一切关于国家机构改革的实现，这些改革将允许居民享有扩大的地方自治，将使政府中央机构的民主化得以实现。
    显然，一个企图实现国家进步的政治纲领的第一点应该是恢复民主的合法性，充分和完全尊重公民的权利和自由以及他们的组织，实现国家的民主改革。
    此外，还有一系列的问题可以用来测量所有拥护民主与社会主义的人们的诚意；这就是经济和社会制度的问题。意大利宪法虽然是一部资产阶级民主宪法，却规定了实行一些关于国家的经济和政治结构的基本改革。特别是它规定了没收巨大的田产，将土地分配给农民，规定将巨大的工业联合企业，特别是具有垄断性的企业国有化。这几年来，由天主教民主党领导的历届政府曾经设法欺骗农民，把微少的土地分配给农民，这些土地是完全不能满足他们的需要的，同时又使他们负担很重的捐税，使他们得到的利益化为乌有。另一方面，历届政府不仅没有进行任何工业企业的国有化，反倒同意让垄断资本家指导国家的全部经济生活。
    所以，显然各社会主义力量的共同纲领的第二点应该是一个关于经济和社会改革的巨大计划，这些改革将消灭封建主义在意大利的一切残余，并打倒垄断性的大资产阶级的势力。
    最后，还有第三点，是关于对外政策和国际关系问题。意大利人民曾经因为法西斯势力发动的第二次世界大战而遭受了深重的苦难，他们深切地希望和平并希望和全世界各国人民合作。并且事实上，也只有和平和合作才能使意大利的商品得到新的市场，使它有可能在良好的条件下派遣技术人员和劳动者到国外去工作；只有和平与合作能够允许它通过必要的经济和社会改革以提高自己的生活水平；只有和平与合作能够允许它保证自己在许多世纪中创造的艺术和文化遗产不遭受破坏，允许它继续在科学、艺术以及文化的一切领域中为全人类的进步作出它的贡献。
    为了这个缘故，在意大利从法西斯主义统治下解放后不久即制定并通过的宪法上写着：意大利拒绝参加作为侵犯他国人民自由之工具及作为解决国际争端之手段的战争。
    但是，实际上，连这一条宪法准则也被历届天主教民主党领导的政府所破坏了。事实上，在宪法通过后不久，它们就开始布置一个巨大的阴谋，企图把意大利绑在侵略政策的战车上。天主教民主党政府是大西洋公约以及对苏联、对欧洲人民民主国家并且对取得了民族独立的亚非国家进行冷战的积极支持者。
    意大利这些年来就这样违反着意大利人民的意志卷入了美国所领导的一切使国际局势尖锐化的行动，而把自己拥有的贫乏的资源的大部分用于军事方面，并让外国人使用自己领土内的军事基地，使自己的和平和安全被置于危险的境地。
    工人阶级和意大利人民当中觉悟最高的最积极的那一部分人曾对天主教民主党历届政府的这种政策进行了斗争，并取得了巨大的胜利。成立欧洲防务集团的计划遭受了可耻的失败，大西洋公约发生了危机，一位著名的意大利人士初次公开在美国提出修改这一公约的必要性，这一切都是由于以工人阶级为首的意大利人民进行了反对战争政策的巨大斗争，并明确地表示了自己保卫和平与民族独立的意志。
    不过，直到现在意大利还没有一种拥护和平和与各国人民合作的积极的政策，这也是事实。这个事实是由于天主教民主党虽然意识到人民对战争政策的厌恶，意识到人民实现充分民族独立的意志，但是仍然维持它和美国帝国主义集团的紧密联系，而无意去忠实地为国家的利益服务。
    举例来说，毫无疑问只是由于意大利政府紧紧地追随美国政策才使意大利至今尚未正式承认中华人民共和国，虽然不仅工人阶级而且全体人民都以深切的同情注意着这一伟大人民的解放运动，并且带着深切的景慕情绪注视它为了进步、为了亚洲及全世界的和平所作出的努力。
    意大利人民也以深切的同情注视亚洲和非洲的人民为取得自己的民族独立所进行的斗争，尤其是注视近几年来埃及政府为了打破束缚在自己身上如此之久的帝国主义锁链的最后环节所采取的行动。
    意大利人民经过顽强的群众性斗争，在一个世纪之前不久才取得了统一和独立，他们对于在二十年法西斯统治之前以及在法西斯统治时期被资产阶级拖入的很少几次罪恶的殖民主义的冒险行动一直是厌恶的。他们或许比任何其他欧洲人民都更了解亚非各国人民所进行的解放运动的伟大和崇高，这种运动使他们摆脱奴役并促使他们积极参加全体进步人类争取和平与进步的斗争。
    所以，毫无疑问，天主教民主党政府对于中华人民共和国和对于近来获得独立的其他亚非国家所采取的政策，以及它最近对埃及问题所持的踌躇不决模棱两可的态度，是一点都不符合意大利人民的愿望的。
    所以，对于那些自称是表达工人阶级和意大利人民的真正利益与深切的愿望的人们，外交政策也是一个考验，也许是主要的考验。
    今天国际的气氛是显然缓和了：新的国家出现在世界舞台上，改变了各国之间力量的对比，各国人民之间的新的关系正在建立起来。对战争的厌恶和对和平的愿望促使全世界广大的人民群众进行斗争。
    因此，应该以赞许的眼光来看待我国内部政治阵容的任何一种改变，这种改变意味着民主、和平和社会主义阵线的扩大，因为它能够导向在议会及国内形成新的多数，并导向成立一个包括一切进步力量并在国内和国际问题上开始一种新政策的政府。
    说实话，那些希望破坏意大利工人阶级的统一，孤立共产党，以便形成一种能够服务于意大利资产阶级在新的面具掩盖下去继续执行旧政策的人是大错特错了。
    工人阶级和意大利人民曾经胜利地进行了反法西斯主义的斗争，曾经不断地进行争取民主、进步与和平的斗争。现在他们将以他们全部力量保卫他们经过长久的顽强的努力才实现了的统一。
    扩大这种统一，把它扩展到一切具有民主见解的社会阶层中去，这是工人阶级和意大利人民当中最前进的力量的意图。在争取和平、自由和进步的斗争中所有真诚的爱国人士都是有地位的。共和国宪法给与一切政党一个共处及合作的基础，它本身就是一个政治纲领的基础，在这个基础上所有和人民联系的政党都能达成它们的协议。
    因此，意大利在最近几年之内有可能会沿着和平的道路向社会主义前进。我们共产党人，都将本着热爱祖国的精神和无产阶级国际主义的理想来尽我们的职责。伟大的中国共产党在争取国家解放，争取以和平方式建立社会主义，争取和平及各国人民之间、各个国家之间的合作的斗争中给与世界一切共产党人和民主人士的崇高典范，以及社会党同志们和各人民民主国家给与我们的典范，对我们来说，都将是一种鼓励和经常的帮助。
