Since May 16th of this year, twenty-seven groups, totaling eight hundred and one Soviet independent travelers, have come to China for travel. The travelers include scientists, professors, doctors, engineers, model workers, and people from all strata and nationalities of the Soviet Union. They have used their precious holidays to visit various parts of China and have been warmly welcomed by the Chinese people.

In January of this year, China International Travel Service and Soviet International Travel Service signed a contract for the mutual exchange of independent travelers. According to the contract, independent travelers from both countries enjoy extremely convenient conditions: for example, a 50% reduction in all expenses, mutual assistance in providing translators, etc. To further facilitate independent travelers from China, the Soviet side also proposed reducing all expenses required for Chinese travelers during their travel in the Soviet Union by 75%.

Soviet independent travelers came to China with boundless love and friendship for the Chinese people. The travelers brought us various precious gifts. The Anichkovs brought a pot of blooming flowers from distant Leningrad. Although they had traveled for more than ten days, under their careful care, the flowers were as fresh as those in the flowerbed when they arrived in China. The Anichkovs said that this was to "present the flowers symbolizing friendship to Chinese comrades." Amosov, Chairman of the Yakut Autonomous Republic Artists Association, brought a delicate Chairman Mao statue to Chinese artists. Donetsk, a famous cameraman from the Leningrad Film Studio, took many shots during his trip, saying, "I want more Soviets to see China." When the textile worker Ovchinnikova visited the Hangzhou Sack Factory, she also demonstrated how to improve the sack weaving machine on the spot. Originally, each sack weaving machine used four belts, which had to be replaced every two weeks. Ovchinnikova suggested that it could be changed to two belts, which would be replaced once a month. The factory is currently testing this. If the experiment is successful, it could save the country tens of thousands of yuan each month.

After returning home, Soviet independent travelers conducted extensive publicity among the broad masses of the Soviet Union. For example, Dzhanavich, Trukhina, and Pakhomov talked about their impressions of visiting China on television broadcasts in Omsk. Lyalya was invited to give a report on her visit to China at schools in Omsk and at a meeting of geography teachers throughout the city.

Soviet travelers are very interested in this form of independent travel. Soviet traveler Khabayev recently wrote to this newspaper saying: "Our travel and visits have further consolidated the friendly cooperation between our two peoples. We are very much in favor of this kind of exchange between ordinary people building a new life." At present, Soviet independent travelers are still coming to China for travel one after another.

The ninth group of Soviet independent travelers to China held a get-together with a visiting group composed of six ethnic minorities from Sichuan Province during their visit to Nanjing. This is a group photo in front of the Nanjing Hotel after the get-together. (Attached picture)

    苏联自费旅行者在我国
    本报讯　从今年5月16日起到目前为止，已有二十七批、共计八百零一个苏联自费旅行者来到我国旅行。旅行者中间有科学家、教授、医生、工程师、劳动模范等苏联各阶层、各民族的人。他们利用自己宝贵的假期，在我国各地进行了参观和访问，受到我国人民的热烈欢迎。
    今年1月间，中国国际旅行社和苏联国际旅行社签订了一个互派自费旅行者的合同。根据合同，两国自费旅行者都享有极方便的条件：例如全部费用减价一半，相互帮助配备翻译人员等，为了更加便利我国自费旅行者，苏联方面又提出减低中国旅行者在苏联旅行期间所需全部费用的75％。
    苏联自费旅行者怀着对中国人民无限的热爱和友谊来到了中国。旅行者给我们带来各种珍贵的礼物。安尼赤科夫夫妇从遥远的列宁格勒带来盛开的鲜花一盆，虽然经过十来天的路程，但是在他们的经心照顾下，当他们到达中国的时候，这些花仍然和花圃里的花一样新鲜。安尼赤科夫夫妇说，这是为了“把象征着友谊的鲜花献给中国同志”。雅库特自治共和国美术家协会主席阿莫索夫带给中国美术家一个精细的毛主席雕像。著名的列宁格勒制片厂摄影师多涅茨，在旅行期间拍摄了很多镜头，他说，“要让更多的苏联人看到中国。”纺织女工奥夫琴尼科娃在参观杭州麻袋厂的时候，还当场示范改进织麻袋机。原来每台织麻袋机上用四条皮带，两星期换皮带一次，奥夫琴尼科娃建议，可以改用两条皮带，每月换一次。现在这个工厂正在试验，如果试验成功，每月可给国家节省好几万元。
    苏联自费旅行者回国后，向苏联广大群众进行了广泛的宣传。例如，杰纳维奇、特鲁希纳和帕毫莫夫曾在鄂木斯克的电视广播里谈了在中国访问的印象。列拉曾被邀请在鄂木斯克的学校和全市地理学教师的会议上，作了访问中国的报告。
    苏联旅行者对这种自费旅行的方式很感兴趣。苏联旅行者哈巴耶夫最近写信给本报说：“我们的旅行访问更加巩固了我们两国人民的友好合作，我们非常赞成这种建设新生活的普通的人们之间的往来。”目前，苏联自费旅行者还在陆续前来我国旅行。
    苏联第九批到中国来旅行的自费旅行者，在访问南京期间，同我国四川省六个少数民族组成的参观团举行了联欢，这是联欢后在南京饭店门前的合影。（附图片）
