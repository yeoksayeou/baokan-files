Retail sales in rural markets in most regions are currently showing a trend of "the peak season being even more prosperous." According to incomplete statistics from various regions, retail sales in mid-September increased by 20.4% compared to early September. In Weinan Gushi Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Shaanxi Province, retail sales in the second half of August increased by one-third compared to the first half. Retail sales in Henan Province in September increased by 19.45% compared to August. According to statistics from eleven key counties in Guangdong Province, retail sales in September increased by 9% compared to August. Farmers in the Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative in Liangcheng County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, had a 25%-30% increase in demand for cotton cloth, fancy gabardine, khaki cloth, etc., in August of this year compared to the same period last year.

In order to welcome the arrival of the peak season, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have made ample preparations in advance. The Jianning County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Fujian Province held peak season training classes, conducting specialized research on the characteristics of this year's peak season, changes in mass demand, and knowledge of peak season purchasing and sales operations. The Qinhutu Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region held a meeting of the "three personnel" (purchasing agents, warehouse keepers, and salespersons), conducted a comprehensive inventory and sorting, distinguished between fast-selling, average-selling, and slow-selling commodities, and conscientiously compiled and revised plans, actively organizing sources of goods. The Songxi County in Fujian Province specially convened a joint meeting of state-owned companies and supply and marketing cooperatives, signing contracts. As of early September, according to incomplete statistics from the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, a total of forty-one counties organized sources of goods through forms such as convening material balance meetings and internal material exchange meetings between state-owned companies and supply and marketing cooperatives. When the Dexing County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jiangxi Province convened a grassroots cooperative business meeting, it organized the participants to visit the county cooperative warehouse and selected red wool, bath towels, and other commodities that had been out of stock in the grassroots cooperatives for a long time. Gan County organized grassroots cooperatives to process bean curd sheets, fermented soybeans, soy sauce, and soybean paste on their own. In addition, various regions also attached importance to giving play to the business enthusiasm of small merchants and peddlers. The Dinglong District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province, led more than twenty small merchants and peddlers, taking turns delivering goods to various agricultural cooperatives, which was well received by the masses. Some regions, in conjunction with the arrangement of small merchants and peddlers, have established retail institutions for various daily necessities and non-staple foods.

    各地农村市场零售额普遍增加
    本报讯　目前大部地区的农村市场，已呈现“旺季更旺”的气象。据各地不完全统计，9月中旬零售额比上旬增加20.4％。陕西省渭南固市供销合作社8月下半月比上半月零售额增长三分之一。河南省9月份零售额比8月上升19.45％。广东省据十一个重点县统计，9月比8月零售额增加9％。内蒙古自治区凉城县金星农业社的农民，在今年8月对棉布、花达呢、卡其布等需要量比去年同期增加25％—30％。
    各地供销合作社为迎接旺季的到来，事先都进行了充分的准备工作。福建省建宁县供销合作社，举办了旺季训练班，对今年旺季的特点、群众需要的变化及旺季购销业务知识等，都作了专门研究。内蒙古自治区秦胡图供销社曾召开了三员（采购员、保管员、营业员）会议，进行了全面的清仓排队工作，分出畅销、平销及滞销的商品，并认真编制和修订计划，积极组织货源。福建省松溪县特召开国营公司和供销社联席会议，签订合同。河北省供销合作社截至9月初旬，据不完全统计，共有四十一个县通过召开国营公司和供销社物资平衡会、内部物资交流会等形式组织货源。江西省德兴县供销合作社召开基层社业务会议时，组织参加会议的人员参观县社仓库，选购了基层社久已脱销的红毛线、浴巾等商品。赣县组织基层社自行加工腐竹、豆豉、酱油、豆酱。此外，各地还重视发挥小商小贩的经营积极性。江西省兴国县鼎龙区供销合作社，带动小商小贩二十余人，轮流送货到各农业社，得到群众好评。有些地区结合对小商小贩的安排，建立了各项日用品及副食品的零售机构。
