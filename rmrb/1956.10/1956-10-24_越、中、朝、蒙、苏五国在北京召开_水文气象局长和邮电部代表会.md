Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd: The conference of hydrological and meteorological bureau chiefs and postal ministry representatives from Vietnam, China, North Korea, Mongolia, and the Soviet Union opened in Beijing today.

The Chinese delegation attending the conference consisted of six people. The head of the delegation was Tu Changwang, Director of the Central Meteorological Bureau.

This conference was convened to further strengthen the ties and cooperation between the participating countries in meteorological work. The conference will study and resolve issues such as organizing dedicated direct telegraph circuits between Vietnam, China, North Korea, Mongolia, and the Soviet Union, exchanging meteorological information and data, strengthening civil aviation meteorological guarantee work on international air routes of the participating countries, and other related meteorological issues.

The opening ceremony began at 3:00 PM. Tu Changwang, head of the Chinese delegation, delivered the opening speech. He said that our five fraternal countries are geographically adjacent to each other, and are all located in the central, eastern, and southeastern parts of the continent. Therefore, the occurrence of each large-scale weather system (such as the outbreak of cold waves in Siberia and the invasion of Pacific typhoons) will affect several of our countries. Therefore, timely collection of sufficient meteorological information within a larger scope to analyze and study large-scale weather processes is of great significance for improving the effectiveness of weather forecasting in serving the national economy.

The heads of the delegations from various countries also spoke.

In the evening, Tu Changwang, head of the Chinese delegation, also held a reception to entertain all members of the delegations from various countries attending the conference.
