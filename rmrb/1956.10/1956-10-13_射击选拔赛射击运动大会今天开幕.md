    Shooting Selection Competition and Shooting Games Open Today
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The shooting selection competition for the Chinese Olympic team and the 1956 National Shooting Games are scheduled to open at the Beijing Shooting Range on the morning of the 13th.
    Eighteen outstanding shooting athletes from our country, including Zhang Hong and Zhang Zhiming, are participating in the selection competition. Three hundred and six athletes from twenty provinces and three municipalities directly under the central government (Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai) are participating in the National Shooting Games, including one hundred and seventeen female athletes.
    Zhang Hong's rapid-fire with a self-selected small-bore pistol achieved a score of 590 rings in September this year, setting a new national record. This score is eleven rings higher than the first-place score (Hungarian Takács) at the previous Olympic Games. His slow-fire with a self-selected small-bore pistol also exceeded the first-place score (American Beiel) at the previous Olympic Games with a score of 554 rings in October this year by one ring. Zhang Zhiming's "running deer" shooting score also recently exceeded the sixth-place score at the previous Olympic Games with a score of 393 rings.
    The games will last for five days and are scheduled to close on the 17th. (Shi Yuzhong, Jiang Guangyu)
