Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 16th: The Guangzhou "Southern Daily" published an editorial today stating: "The Hong Kong British authorities' behavior of sheltering and condoning Kuomintang secret agents must stop! The Hong Kong British authorities' irresponsible attitude towards the lives and property of peaceful residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon must be corrected!"

The editorial said: "Who are the main culprits of the Kowloon riots? The reports of all fair-minded public opinion around the world and all reporters on the scene who are loyal to the facts have affirmed with ironclad certainty: they are Kuomintang secret agents. However, the Hong Kong British authorities have repeatedly distorted the facts." The Hong Kong British authorities initially described the riots created by Kuomintang secret agents as a conflict between two factions of Chinese people or a struggle between left-wing and right-wing movement members, attempting to shirk their responsibility and find excuses for the condoning behavior of the British military and police who were merely "playing hide-and-seek" with the rioters during the riots and atrocities, or standing by with folded arms, or fleeing at the first sign of trouble, allowing the secret agents and thugs to do whatever they wanted. Then, they claimed: this riot was planned and directed by "secret societies" such as the local "Triads"; this is an attempt to exonerate the chief culprits, so that those Kuomintang secret agent bosses who wore well-tailored suits, sported Kuomintang badges, rode in "white license plate cars," and held high the Kuomintang flag to direct the riots could go unpunished. The most absurd thing is the conversation that the Hong Kong British Governor, Grantham, had with reporters in Tokyo on October 13th. He was on a plane back to Hong Kong at the time, claiming that he did not understand the situation, but dared to assert that this was a "Communist Party versus Kuomintang event," using the same tone as the US-Chiang news agency to slander the Chinese people. People from all walks of life in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City have expressed extreme anger at this. The editorial pointed out: "In this incident, the loss of life and property of the peaceful residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon is very significant. A large number of residents were killed and injured; factories, shops, schools, hospitals, community centers, and residential houses were burned, looted, and destroyed. According to only a portion of the materials revealed by Hong Kong newspapers, the loss of the Garden Company alone is worth five million Hong Kong dollars. Deng Dianchu, the owner of the Guangzhou Steel Window Factory, estimates that his factory's loss is worth one million Hong Kong dollars. The new site of Heung To Middle School had just been completed, and the school buildings and various equipment were worth a total of 770,000 Hong Kong dollars, but now they have been reduced to ashes. Nearly a thousand factories in Kowloon and Tsuen Wan were shut down for several days. According to Hong Kong economic figures, the cotton textile industry alone reduced production by one million Hong Kong dollars per day; as for the loss of shops throughout the city due to closures, it is certainly significant. Seeing such serious deaths, injuries, and losses, people cannot help but hate the Kuomintang secret agents with gnashing teeth."

The editorial went on to expose that the Hong Kong British authorities were trying to minimize the losses of this riot through their own propaganda. The editorial took Tsuen Wan as an example, pointing out: "On the 14th, the Hong Kong British authorities announced that only four people died in the Tsuen Wan riots, including those who died after being injured. However, everyone with a memory still remembers that at 2:00 a.m. on the 12th, the same Hong Kong agency's announcement admitted that 30 residents had died in Tsuen Wan. According to a report by a reporter for the Hong Kong English "South China Morning Post" who accompanied the British military and police into Tsuen Wan, more than 30 people were killed on the spot in Tsuen Wan. According to a Hong Kong Chinese newspaper report, a total of three trucks of corpses were transported from Tsuen Wan back to the Kowloon mortuary, and 28 injured people were sent to Kwong Wah Hospital in Kowloon for treatment alone. Those who died of serious injuries should be included in the total number of deaths. From this, people can see that the British authorities, who always talk about 'reputation', are acting against common sense. Could it be that these victims could not get the protection of the Hong Kong British authorities when they were alive, and they have to be treated like their bodies are being destroyed after their death? May I ask what the Hong Kong British authorities' intentions are? You have so obviously exonerated the Kuomintang secret agents and concealed their crimes first, and then so carefully concealed the crimes caused by the Kuomintang secret agents later. Do you really intend to shelter and condone these heinous criminals to the end?"

The editorial concluded: "We warn the Hong Kong British authorities: Now, the two million and several hundred thousand residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon, the thirty million and several hundred thousand people in Guangdong Province, the entire Chinese people, and even the people of the whole world are watching how you treat these heinous criminals!"

    全中国人民都注视着香港当局怎样对待这些罪恶滔天的凶犯
    南方日报就九龙骚乱事件发表社论
    新华社广州16日电　广州“南方日报”今天发表的社论指出：“香港英国当局包庇、纵容国民党特务分子的行为必须停止！香港英国当局对港九和平居民的生命财产不负责任的态度必须纠正！”
    社论说：“九龙骚乱的罪魁祸首是谁？全世界一切公正舆论和亲历现场的一切忠于事实的记者的报道，都铁一般肯定：是国民党特务分子。可是，香港英国当局却一再歪曲事实。”香港英国当局初则把国民党特务分子制造的暴乱，说成是两派华人的冲突或者左翼同右翼运动成员之间的斗争，企图推卸自己的责任，为在骚乱和暴行进行当中，英国军警一味同暴乱者在“捉迷藏”，或者袖手旁观，或者望风逃遁，任让特务和暴徒为所欲为的纵容行为，找寻借口。继而又宣称：这个暴乱是当地“三合会”之类的“秘密帮会”所策划和指挥的；这就是企图为主凶祸首开脱罪行，好让那些穿着笔挺西装，佩戴国民党徽章，乘坐“白牌汽车”，高举国民党旗，来往指挥暴乱的国民党特务头目逍遥法外。最为荒谬的是，香港英国总督葛量洪10月13日在东京对记者的谈话。他当时是在乘坐飞机回香港的途中，自称对事态并不了解，竟敢断言这是“共产党对国民党的事件”，用美蒋通讯社同一口吻来诬蔑中国人民。广东省、广州市各界人民对此无不表示极度的愤怒。社论指出：“这次事件，港九和平居民的生命财产的损失是十分重大的。大批居民死亡、受伤；工厂、商店、学校、医院、社团会址和居民住宅被烧被抢被毁。仅据香港报纸透露的一部分材料，嘉顿饼干公司的损失共值五百万港元。广州钢窗厂主人邓典初估计，自己的工厂损失共值一百万港元。香岛中学新址是刚刚落成的，校舍和各种设备共值七十七万港元，现在已付之一炬。九龙和荃湾近千家工厂停工几日，据香港经济界人士估算，仅棉纺业一行每天即减少了一百万港元的生产；至于全市商店因停业的损失，当然也是重大的。看到这种严重的死伤和损失，人们不能不对于国民党特务分子切齿痛恨。”
    社论接着还揭露香港英国当局力图通过自己的宣传，对于这次暴乱的损失化大为小。社论拿荃湾一地为例指出：“14日香港英国当局公布说：荃湾暴乱仅有四个人死亡，包括受伤后身死的在内。可是，每一个有记忆能力的人都还记得，在12日晨二时，同一个香港当事机关的公告承认，荃湾死亡的居民为三十人。根据香港英文‘南华早报’发表该报随英国军警进入荃湾的记者报道，在荃湾当场被杀害的即超过三十人。又据香港一张中文报纸报道，从荃湾运返九龙殓房的尸体共有三卡车，仅送进九龙广华医院救治的受伤者即有二十八人。其中伤重不治致死的，应当包括在死亡总人数之内。人们由此可以看到：口口声声讲‘名誉’的英国当局是违反常理了。难道这些被害者生前得不到香港英国当局的保护，而在死后还要受到如同毁尸灭迹之惨吗？请问香港英国当局究竟居心何在呢？你们那样明显地替国民党特务分子开脱罪行掩盖于先，而又这样谨慎地替国民党特务分子所造成的罪行掩盖于后，难道真的立心对这些罪大恶极的凶犯包庇纵容到底吗？”
    社论最后说：“我们正告香港英国当局：现在港九二百几十万居民，广东省三千几百万人民，全中国人民以至全世界人民，都在注视着你们怎样对待这些罪恶滔天的凶犯！”
