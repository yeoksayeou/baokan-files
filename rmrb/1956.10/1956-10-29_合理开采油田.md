    Rational Oil Field Development
    Yang Zhengmin, Director of the Yumen Mining Bureau, Ministry of Petroleum Industry
    The Yumen Oilfield was discovered in 1936 and drilling began in 1939. In the ten years up to 1949, very few wells were drilled and very little oil was produced. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, we resolutely implemented the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, deeply mobilized the masses, carried out democratic reforms, and, with the help of Soviet and other people's democratic countries' experts, carried out reconstruction and expansion. Thanks to the continuous improvement of the enthusiasm and technical level of all employees in building socialism, in the past six years, the drilling footage has increased by nine and a half times, and the crude oil production has increased by three and a half times. This year's crude oil production will exceed the total output in the ten years before liberation. At present, all the mine's employees are striving to achieve the goal of building a petroleum base within two years.
    Although our work has achieved some results, there have also been many lessons. What is worth remembering is that we once took a detour in oilfield development. The Laojunmiao Oilfield is a medium-sized oilfield with good reservoir properties, and currently undertakes the main task of natural petroleum production in our country. Because the development plan was made late and the oilfield construction was delayed, it still cannot fully contribute its capacity. Why did this happen? This is because we had no experience in petroleum development and lacked understanding. We only knew how to find oilfields, thinking that everything would be fine after finding an oilfield, but we didn't understand that there are three basic links in developing China's petroleum industry: exploration, development, and processing, and none of them can be missing.
    During the first Five-Year Plan, due to the development of petroleum exploration forces, corresponding results were also obtained. The recent discovery of the Karamay Oilfield and the oil spraying in the Qaidam Basin will enable the problem of natural petroleum resources to be initially solved in a short period of time. Petroleum processing can currently barely cope. Only the oilfield development force is the weakest, so it has affected the completion of the crude oil production target of the first Five-Year Plan. To reverse the backward situation of the petroleum industry during the second Five-Year Plan, in addition to continuing to strengthen petroleum exploration work, we also need to pay greater attention to oilfield development. Otherwise, even if there is oil, it cannot be extracted.
    Rational oilfield development can maximize the extraction of underground petroleum resources. The advanced development method is to maintain the reservoir pressure. This method is to inject water or gas artificially according to the reservoir properties, which can keep the oilfield continuously flowing and obtain a recovery rate of more than 70%. Otherwise, only a recovery rate of 30% to 40% can be obtained. To do this, we must first explore the industrial reserves, determine the oilfield boundaries and reservoir properties, so as to formulate development plans and overall designs. These tasks are relatively complex and detailed, especially determining the reservoir drive type (the natural ability of the oil-bearing rock layer to store oil, which can drive crude oil from the oil layer to the oil well and lead it to the ground), which requires accumulating considerable drilling geological data and the guidance of scientific research work. Otherwise, we cannot "prescribe the right medicine" and will make the mistake of blind development. For example, the L reservoir of Yumen (the main oil-bearing layer of the Laojunmiao Oilfield) was considered to be "dissolved gas drive" by Chinese and foreign experts before 1953, so it was developed according to the gas drive oilfield. As a result, the oilfield's vitality was greatly damaged, the reservoir pressure decreased, and many oil wells could not maintain their natural flow. Later, with the help of Academician Trafimuk of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, it was determined that the L reservoir was water drive, and a water injection development plan was formulated, which led the oilfield development work onto the right path.
    We did not grasp the method of rational oilfield development all at once, but gradually recognized and gradually clarified it. The Yumen Oilfield suffered great losses due to unreasonable development before liberation, but after clarifying the nature of the oilfield in 1954, no measures were taken immediately. This is because some people believe that China urgently needs petroleum, and the oil production capacity of the Laojunmiao Oilfield is very large, so they always want to extract more oil as soon as possible. Therefore, the oilfield development method was delayed for a year, and the output that could have been achieved in 1957 had to be postponed. While the problem of petroleum resources is gradually being solved, we must pay great attention to oilfield development, especially to establishing and strengthening the guiding role of scientific research work.
    In petroleum industrial construction, according to our past experience, we must first solve the problems of roads, railways, water sources, and power stations. In the past, the Yumen Oilfield had inconvenient transportation. Long-distance truck transportation consumed a lot of fuel. A round trip of a truck often consumed one-third of the oil it carried. When the railway was built, the throughput increased sharply, requiring the oilfield construction and production to develop rapidly. Because the original power station had a small power supply, it was necessary to use scattered diesel engines, forming a situation where the power plant was expanded every year, but it was still not enough. A large amount of oil development requires a large amount of water. Due to insufficient water equipment in Yumen, it was expanded three times in a row, but it still could not meet the needs. Therefore, the occurrence of these phenomena is mainly due to the lack of overall planning in the development work and the failure to look at the problem from the perspective of development, but unilaterally emphasizing a certain aspect. In view of the fact that most of the petroleum resources that have been found in our country are located in sparsely populated areas in the northwest, with inconvenient transportation and a lack of water sources, we may encounter more difficulties than the Yumen Oilfield. Therefore, it is hoped that the Yumen lesson will be learned in future oilfield development work, and that we should make overall plans and long-term plans, and never proceed solely from subjective wishes, violating the requirements of objective laws. Otherwise, it will bring serious difficulties to the construction of the oilfield and greatly affect the development of production.
    The Eighth National Congress of the Party has given us infinite strength. We will abide by the spirit of the Congress and quickly complete the construction of the Yumen Oilfield so as to contribute more strength to support the new oil areas and strive to change the backward state of China's petroleum industry during the second Five-Year Plan.

    合理开采油田
    石油工业部玉门矿务局局长　杨拯民
    玉门油矿是1936年发现的，1939年开始钻探，到1949年的十年间，所钻的井和产的油都是极少的。解放后，我们在党的领导下，坚决执行了党的七届二中全会的决议，深入地发动了群众，进行了民主改革，在苏联和其他人民民主国家专家的帮助下，进行了改建和扩建。由于全体职工建设社会主义积极性和技术水平的不断提高，近六年来，使钻井进尺增长了九倍半，原油产量增长了三点五倍，今年原油产量将超过解放前十年产量的总和。目前全矿职工正在为两年内建成石油基地的目标而奋斗。
    我们的工作虽然获得了些成绩，也有不少教训。值得记取的是在油田开采上，曾经走过一段弯路。老君庙油田是一个中等油田，油藏性质较好，目前担负着我国天然石油生产的主要任务。因为开发方案作迟了，油田建设搞晚了，目前还不能全面出力。为什么会发生这种情况呢？这是由于我们对石油的开采没有经验，缺乏认识，只知道找油田，以为找到油田后就可以万事大吉，而不了解发展我国石油工业，有三个基本环节，这就是勘探、开采和加工，三者缺一不可。
    在第一个五年计划期间，由于石油探勘力量的发展，也获得了相应的成果，最近克拉玛依油田的发现和柴达木地区喷油，天然石油资源问题将能够在短期内得到初步解决。石油加工，目前尚能勉强应付。唯有油田开采力量最为薄弱，所以影响了第一个五年计划原油产量的完成。在第二个五年计划期间要扭转石油工业的落后形势，除了需要继续加强石油探勘工作外，还需要更大地注意油田开采问题，不然，有油也拿不出来。
    合理的开采油田，可以最大限度地采出地下的石油资源。先进的开采方法就是用保持油层压力的方法。这种方法是根据油藏性质进行人工注水注气，既可以保持油田一直自喷，并能获得采收率70％以上，否则只能得到采收率30％至40％。要这样做，首先就要探明工业储量，确定油田边缘和油藏性质，以便拟定开采方案和总体设计。这些工作都是比较复杂细致的，尤其是确定油藏驱动类型（含油岩层贮藏的天然能力，这种能力可以驱使原油从油层移到油井和引出地面），需要积累相当的钻井地质资料和科学研究工作的配合指导。不然就不能“对症下药”，就会发生盲目开采的错误。如玉门的L油藏（老君庙油田的主要储油层），在1953年前，中外专家都认为是“溶解气驱”，于是也就按照气驱油田进行开采，结果大大损伤了油田元气，油层压力降低，很多油井不能维持自喷。后来在苏联科学院院士特拉费姆克帮助下，才确定了L油藏是水力驱动，制定了注水开采方案，才将油田开采工作引上正确的道路。
    合理地开采油田方法，我们并不是一下子就掌握的，而是逐渐认识、逐渐明确的。玉门油矿在解放前由于不合理地进行开采，使油田受到很大损失，可是在1954年弄清了油田性质以后，也没有立即采取措施。这是因为有的人认为中国目前迫切需要石油，而老君庙油田的产油能力又很大，总想尽快多拿出一些油来。因此，在油田开采方法上延迟了一年之久，本来在1957年能够达到的产量，不得不推后。我们在石油资源问题逐步获得解决的同时，对于油田开采必须给以极大的重视，特别是建立和加强科学研究工作的指导作用。
    在石油工业建设上，根据我们过去的经验，首先要解决公路、铁路、水源和电站问题。玉门油矿过去交通不便，长途汽车运输，消耗极大，汽车往返一次往往消耗它所载油量的三分之一；当铁道修通以后，吞吐量骤增，需要油田建设和生产迅速发展。由于原来电站供电量较少，不得不使用零星的柴油机，形成年年扩充电厂，年年不够用。大量开采石油需要大量的水，玉门因水的设备不够，连续扩建了三次还不能满足需要。所以发生这些现象，主要是开采工作缺乏全面的规划，没有从发展的观点去看问题，而片面地强调了某一个方面所造成的。鉴于我国已经找到的石油资源，大多处于西北人烟稀少的地区，交通不便，水源缺乏，可能还会碰到比玉门油矿更多的困难。因此，希望在今后开采油田工作上接受玉门这一条教训，要全面打算和长远打算，决不能单凭主观愿望出发，违背客观规律的要求。不然会给油田的建设带来严重的困难，大大影响生产的发展。
    党的第八次代表大会，给了我们无限的力量，我们将遵照大会的精神，很快把玉门油矿建设完成，以便拿出更多的力量，支援新的油区，为在第二个五年计划期间，改变我国石油工业的落后状态而努力。
