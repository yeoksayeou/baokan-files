    The Jiujiang Region, Which Has Always Been Short of Grain, Will Have a Surplus for Outward Transfer This Year
    (Our Newspaper) News: The Jiujiang Region of Jiangxi Province has achieved an unprecedented increase in grain production this year. According to estimates from relevant departments, the total grain output this year may reach 1.3 billion catties, an increase of 20% compared to last year, exceeding the total grain output of the First Five-Year Plan by more than 7%. The Jiujiang region has always been a grain-deficient area. This year, not only will it not need to import grain from other places, but it will also have a surplus for outward transport. Currently, agricultural cooperative members in various places are busy harvesting late rice with meticulous care. After the realization of cooperativization throughout the region last winter and this spring, the agricultural cooperatives changed the single-cropping mid-season rice to double-cropping rice. The double-cropping rice area in the region expanded from more than 100,000 mu in the past during trial planting to more than 770,000 mu. The reform of the cultivation system, coupled with the implementation of increased production measures such as large-scale water conservancy construction, has achieved a huge success in greatly increasing grain production. For example, the yield of early-maturing rice in Xingzi County is almost equal to the total rice yield for the whole of last year. Some areas experienced relatively severe drought this year, but through the day and night water lifting, water diversion irrigation, and strengthened field management by agricultural cooperative members, drought-affected areas have reduced and avoided drought losses.

    一向缺粮的九江地区
    今年将有余粮外调
    本报讯　江西省九江地区今年粮食空前增产，据有关部门估计，今年粮食总产量可达十三亿斤，比去年增产二成，超过第一个五年计划粮食总产量的7％以上。九江地区一向都是缺粮的地区，今年不仅不要从外地调进粮食，还可有部分余粮外运。目前，各地农业社员们，正在忙着精细地收割晚稻。去冬今春全专区实现合作化以后，各农业社将一年一收的中稻变为双季稻，全专区双季稻面积由过去试种时的十多万亩扩大到七十七万多亩。耕作制度的改革加上大量兴修水利等增产措施的贯彻执行，就取得了大量增产粮食的巨大成就。如星子县光早稻的产量就几乎等于去年全年水稻的产量。部分地区今年曾发生较严重的旱象，但经农业社员们日夜车水、引水灌溉和加强田间管理，受旱地区都减轻和避免了旱灾损失。
