Xinhua News Agency, Rome, October 20th—According to TASS, Rome, October 19th: The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party published in "Unità" on the 18th the draft program adopted by the Central Committee's plenary session, which is to be submitted to the Eighth Party Congress to be held in December. Its title is: "Supporting Italy's Road to Socialism."

	The preface to the draft program states that a new situation has emerged in the world. The great achievements of socialism have changed the economic and political structure of the whole world. Capitalism is no longer the dominant force. The cause of peace has achieved great victories. New wars can be avoided. Some emerging countries that were under colonial oppression yesterday are moving towards freedom. The road for people to progress politically and socially is becoming wider and more reliable. The preface points out that this new situation is also developing in Italy. It has preserved the basic victories gained by overthrowing fascist rule. The workers' movement and the people's movement have preserved their positions and their strength. The preface says: In order to overcome Italy's economic and political backwardness, to eliminate unemployment and poverty, to meet the peasants' demands for land, and to make technological progress a decisive factor in social progress, it is becoming increasingly clear and urgent to move forward, to take effective measures to combat monopoly capital in agriculture and industry, to start a profound transformation of the economic structure, and to realize the reforms stipulated by the constitution. The working class and the people are advancing along this road, defending, consolidating, and expanding the scope of the democratic system, and they are moving towards socialism.

	The draft program analyzes the current international situation and Italy's foreign policy. It also analyzes Italy's economic and social conditions. This document emphasizes that the current situation in Italy raises the issue of changing the country's general political line. Italy must turn to the left, which will help to establish a democratic government of the working people that fully realizes the Italian constitution.

	The draft program also elaborates on the goals put forward by the Communist Party in carrying out democratic reforms of the country's economy, society, and culture, as well as the party's tasks in leading the working class and the Italian people in their struggle for democracy and socialism.

	A few days ago, "Unità" also published the basic principles of the Italian Communist Party's program statement.
