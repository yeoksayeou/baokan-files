    Organizing Forces, Learning from Advanced Factories
    Qiqihar's Local Industry Reverses Backward Situation
    (Our report) In recent months, Qiqihar City's local state-owned industry has launched a movement to learn from advanced domestic factories and catch up with them, achieving certain results. Currently, twelve types of products from Qiqihar's local state-owned factories have reached the quality level of advanced domestic factories, and the costs of eight types of products have been reduced. The Heilongjiang Hardware Factory's "Black Dragon" brand popular ice skates used to have defects such as dullness, lack of shine, and curved blades, only allowing skating for 4,000 meters at a time. The ice skates produced this year are not only beautiful but also durable, now capable of high-speed skating for 10,000 meters, and the ex-factory price has been reduced by 23.5% compared to last year. The Qiqihar Ceramics Factory's standard firebricks have a cost 29.4% lower than the standard firebricks produced by the Tangshan Desheng Kiln (deducting regional price differences).
    In the process of learning from advanced domestic factories, the city's local state-owned factories have trial-produced forty-four types of new products with more than three thousand designs. The Qiqihar Brick Factory has used magnesite, sawdust, and calcium chloride as raw materials to trial-produce magnesite tiles. These tiles are lightweight, have strong bending resistance, and are low in cost. In July, it won the first prize for new products in Heilongjiang Province's local industry. Recently, this factory has also successfully trial-produced chemical flooring and insulation bricks and has already put them into production.
    In the past, the product quality of Qiqihar's local state-owned industry has been consistently low. Costs were also 2% to 10% higher than in Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Changchun, and other places. In order to completely reverse the situation of low quality and high costs, in May, eighteen factories sent more than seventy people in batches to advanced factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, Dalian, Changchun, and other places to study. The director of the Songjiang Stationery Factory personally led two management cadres and two technicians to the Shanghai Cuihua Card Factory, the People's Carbon Paper Factory, and the Minsheng Science Ink Factory to study the entire production technology procedures and formulas. After returning to the factory, they immediately organized workers to study, changing the phenomenon of poor product quality in their factory. After learning from the experience of advanced factories, the quality of the Ya Guang Soap and wool sweaters from the Heilongjiang Soap Factory and the Heilongjiang Knitting Factory have improved.

    组织力量，向先进工厂学习
    齐齐哈尔地方工业扭转落后局面
    本报讯　近几个月来，齐齐哈尔市地方国营工业开展了向国内先进工厂看齐，赶上国内先进工厂的运动，获到一定的成绩。目前，齐市地方国营工厂已经有十二种产品质量达到国内先进厂的水平，有八种产品降低了成本。黑龙江五金厂以前生产的黑龙牌普及冰刀，缺点是不光、不亮，刀刃出弯，一次只能滑行四千公尺，今年生产的冰刀，不仅美观，而且耐用。已经做到开刃速滑一万公尺，出厂价格比去年降低23.5％。齐齐哈尔陶瓷厂的普型耐火砖，成本比唐山德胜窑厂普型耐火砖低29.4％（扣出地区差价）。
    在向国内先进工厂学习的过程中，全市地方国营工厂共试制了四十四种三千多个花样的新产品。齐齐哈尔市制砖厂利用菱苦土、锯末、氯化钙为原料，试制成菱苦土瓦，这种瓦体轻、抗折力强，成本低。7月份获得了黑龙江省地方工业新产品一等奖。最近，这个厂又试制成功化学地板和保温砖，并且已经投入生产。
    过去，齐齐哈尔市地方国营工业的产品质量一直是很低。成本也比上海、天津、沈阳、长春等地高到2％到10％。为了彻底扭转质量低成本高的局面，今年五月有十八个工厂，派出七十多人，分批到上海、天津、旅大、长春等地先进工厂学习。松江文教用品厂厂长，亲自带领两名管理干部，两名技工，到上海粹华卡片厂、人民复写纸厂和民生科学墨水厂学习全部生产技术工艺规程和配方。回厂后，立即组织工人进行学习，改变了本厂产品质量不好的现象。黑龙江肥皂厂、黑龙江针织厂学习了先进厂的经验以后，亚光肥皂和绒衣的质量都有了提高。
