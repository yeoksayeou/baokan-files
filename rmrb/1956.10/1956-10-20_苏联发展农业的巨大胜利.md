    The Great Victory of Soviet Agricultural Development
    This year, the Soviet Union achieved an unprecedented bumper grain harvest. The harvest was good everywhere, and even better in the eastern reclaimed areas. So far, the two major grain-producing areas of the Soviet Union—the Russian Federal Republic and the Kazakh Republic—have delivered 3,004,340,000 poods (equivalent to 98,420,000,000 jin) of grain to the state, which is nearly half more than the total amount of grain purchased by the entire Soviet Union in 1953. The bumper harvest marks a new major victory for the Soviet Union in agricultural production. This is a great happy event for the Soviet people.
    This year's bumper grain harvest in the Soviet Union is the result of the Soviet people's vigorous efforts to develop agriculture, especially the large-scale reclamation of wasteland, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government.
    In the past three years, the Soviet Party and government have taken a series of measures to rapidly increase agricultural production. The 1954 decision on large-scale reclamation of wasteland had a decisive significance for the rapid increase in Soviet grain production. The Soviet Party and government's call for large-scale reclamation of wasteland received enthusiastic support from the entire Soviet working people. Because hundreds of thousands of Soviet youth eagerly participated in the land reclamation work, and because the powerful Soviet industry provided a large number of tractors and other agricultural machinery in the land reclamation, the Soviet Union has reclaimed 35.5 million hectares (equivalent to 532.5 million mu) of wasteland in just three years. In the past three years, the Soviet Union's grain sown area has been expanded by 37 million hectares, which is more than the increase in the sown area in the United States during the forty years from 1910 to 1950.
    The Soviet Union's bumper grain harvest has greatly increased the total grain output and the amount of grain purchased by the state. The Kazakh Republic, whose grain production has always been backward, has rapidly expanded its grain sown area due to the reclamation of 20 million hectares of wasteland in the past three years. At present, the republic has delivered 1,000,340,000 poods of grain to the state, which is more than the total amount of grain provided to the state by the republic in the eleven years before the large-scale reclamation of wasteland. Today, the Kazakh Republic has surpassed Ukraine, the famous "granary" of the Soviet Union, and has become the second largest grain-producing area in the Soviet Union. This fact fully demonstrates how great the victory of the Soviet Union's large-scale reclamation of wasteland plan is.
    The Soviet Union has obtained so much grain this year, which has never been seen before, which can meet all the basic needs for grain, and therefore, the living standards of the people will be further improved. The Soviet Union's bumper grain harvest can enable the country to have more grain reserves and can provide more favorable conditions for the future development of animal husbandry. In the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union particularly emphasized the development of the eastern region. Therefore, this year's bumper harvest in the eastern reclaimed areas of the Soviet Union is of particularly great significance for directly supporting the industrial construction of the eastern region. The Soviet Union's bumper grain harvest will also enable the Soviet Union to increase its grain exports to support fraternal countries and other countries that lack grain. The rapid increase in Soviet grain production means that the huge task of increasing the annual grain output stipulated in the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan will be completed ahead of schedule and exceeded.
    The fact of the Soviet Union's bumper harvest shows that the Soviet Union's large-scale reclamation of wasteland plan is not a "gamble" as American agriculturalists say, but a completely feasible plan. Of course, it is only possible to achieve such an unprecedentedly huge plan in a powerful socialist industrial country like the Soviet Union. While the United States is experiencing an agricultural crisis and reducing the grain sown area, the great Soviet people are creating amazing miracles in rapidly increasing agricultural production. This clearly shows the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system.

### 苏联发展农业的巨大胜利

    苏联发展农业的巨大胜利
    今年苏联获得了空前未有的谷物大丰收。各地收成很好，东部开荒地区收成更好。到目前为止，苏联两大产粮区——俄罗斯联邦共和国和哈萨克共和国——已向国家交售了三十亿零四百三十四万普特（合九百八十四亿二千多万市斤）谷物，这比1953年全苏联采购粮食的总数还要多将近一半。大丰收标志着苏联在农业生产上获得了新的重大胜利。这是苏联人民的一件大喜事。
    今年苏联的谷物大丰收，是苏联人民在苏联共产党和苏联政府领导下，大力发展农业，特别是大规模开垦荒地的结果。
    三年来，苏联党和政府采取了一系列急速提高农业生产的措施，1954年关于大规模开垦荒地的决定，对于苏联谷物产量的迅速增加具有决定性的意义。苏联党和政府关于大规模开荒的号召，得到了苏联全体劳动人民的热烈支持。由于几十万苏联青年争先恐后地参加了开荒工作，由于强大的苏联工业在开荒中提供了大量的拖拉机和其他的农业机器，因此在短短的三年中，苏联已经开垦了三千五百五十万公顷（合五亿三千二百五十万市亩）荒地。三年来，苏联谷物播种面积已扩大了三千七百万公顷，这比美国在1910年到1950年四十年间播种面积增加的数目还要多。
    苏联的谷物大丰收，使苏联谷物总产量和国家粮食采购量大大增加了。谷物生产一向落后的哈萨克共和国，由于在过去三年中开垦了二千万公顷荒地，谷物播种面积迅速扩大了。目前，这个共和国已向国家交售了十亿零三十四万普特的谷物，这个数字比这个共和国大规模开荒前十一年中向国家提供的谷物总数还要多。今天，哈萨克共和国已经越过苏联著名的“谷仓”乌克兰，一跃而成为苏联第二大产粮区了。这个事实充分说明了苏联大规模开垦荒地计划取得的胜利是多么巨大。
    苏联今年得到过去从未有过的这么多的粮食，这可以满足对谷物的一切基本需要，因此，人民的生活水平将更加提高。苏联谷物大丰收可以使国家有更多的粮食储备，并且可以为今后发展畜牧业提供更有利的条件。在苏联第六个五年计划中，苏联特别着重开发东部。因此，今年苏联东部开荒地区的大丰收，对于直接支援东部的工业建设具有特别重大的意义。苏联谷物大丰收也将使苏联增加粮食的出口，以支援那些缺少粮食的兄弟国家和其他国家。苏联谷物产量的迅速增加，意味着苏联第六个五年计划所规定的提高谷物年产量的巨大任务将会提前和超额完成。
    苏联大丰收的事实说明：苏联大规模开垦荒地的计划，并不像美国农业家所说的是“一场赌博”，而是完全可能实现的计划。当然，在短期间实现这样一个空前巨大的计划，只有在像苏联这样的强大的社会主义工业国家中才有可能做到。当美国正在闹农业危机，缩减谷物播种面积的时候，伟大的苏联人民却在迅速提高农业生产方面创造了惊人的奇迹。这就十分清楚地显示了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的无比优越性。
