　　Madame Nu's son, Maung, said amidst the warm applause of the children, "I am very happy that we can meet together today." He said, "Now, children are also very dear to each other. Today's pleasant get-together, I think, is a symbol of the friendship between our two countries."

　　Madame Nu said, "I brought my two children to China to let them become friends with the Chinese children, so that the friendship between our two countries will grow even more." She said that soon a Burmese women's delegation will come to China for a visit, and the friendship between Chinese and Burmese women will be even deeper. She said that she brought the friendship of Burmese women to extend cordial greetings to Chinese women. She hoped that China would send a women's delegation to visit Burma.

　　At the party, Chinese and Burmese children performed wonderful artistic programs for each other. Madame Nu's daughter, who had won an award at the Burmese Water Splashing Festival, danced the Water Splashing Festival dance at the meeting.

　　Xu Guangping, on behalf of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defence of Children, presented Madame Nu's son with the "Four Treasures of the Study," and her daughter with a doll, and also gave each of the Burmese children who participated in today's party a gift.
