Major Technological Innovation in China's Sulfuric Acid Industry
Yongli Ning Factory Successfully Reconstructed "Fluidized Bed" Roaster
Production Capacity Five to Six Times Larger Than Mechanical Furnaces, Reduced Sulfur Content in Residue

(Our dispatch) The joint state-private Yongli Ning Factory has successfully reconstructed two "fluidized bed" roasters from existing mechanical furnaces, and they have recently been put into production one after another.

The use of "fluidized bed" roasters to roast pyrite is a recent development internationally. Therefore, the formal application of the "fluidized bed" marks that the production technology of China's sulfuric acid industry is rapidly catching up with the world's advanced levels.

This technological innovation was initiated by engineers Chen Dong and Huang Yike of the Yongli Ning Factory. The central leading departments immediately allocated funds to strongly support it. After many improvements and repeated test runs over the past four months, it finally succeeded.

The successful reconstruction of the "fluidized bed" has unlocked enormous potential for increasing sulfuric acid production. In the sulfuric acid manufacturing process, the mechanical furnaces used by this factory in the past were bulky in structure. The ore had to be gradually roasted through eight to twelve layers of furnace surfaces to complete the gas production task. This type of mechanical furnace easily caused scaling inside the furnace at high temperatures, the ore was not fully burned, and about 2% of the sulfur in the residue was discarded. The "fluidized bed" has a simple structure. After the ore enters the furnace, it relies on the wind power injected by a huge blower to form a "tumbling" intense combustion, which can quickly burn out the sulfur contained in the ore. From the initial trial stage observations of these two fluidized beds, its production capacity is five to six times larger than that of mechanical furnaces, and the sulfur content in the ore residue is only 0.5% - 0.8%, thus greatly reducing losses and reducing costs. After further improvements in certain auxiliary equipment, this type of fluidized bed can achieve fully mechanized automatic control, without manual labor from feeding to ash removal. Especially at a time when pyrite supply is insufficient, the fluidized bed roaster, with its superior combustion performance, can use a large amount of tailings (magnetic pyrite) with lower sulfur content to replace good ore, saving valuable resources for the country. It is estimated that after all the mechanical furnaces in this factory are rebuilt, more than 100,000 tons of tailings can be utilized in a year.

    我国硫酸工业的重大技术革新
    永利宁厂改建“沸腾式”焙烧炉成功
    生产能力比机械炉大五倍到六倍，残渣含硫量降低
    本报讯　公私合营永利宁厂用原有机械炉改建两座“沸腾式”焙烧炉获得成功，已经在最近先后投入生产。
    采用“沸腾式”焙烧炉焙烧硫铁矿在国际上还是近几年来的新发展。因此，“沸腾炉”的正式应用，标志了我国硫酸工业的生产技术正在迅速赶上世界先进水平。
    这一技术革新是永利宁厂工程师陈东、黄以恪等倡议的，中央领导部门立即拨款大力支持，经过四个月来许多次改进和反复试车，终于得到成功。
    “沸腾炉”的改建成功，为提高硫酸生产发掘出巨大潜力。在硫酸制造过程中，这个厂过去采用的机械炉结构笨重，矿砂在炉内要经过八至十二层炉面的逐步焙烧，才能完成制气任务。这种机械炉在高温下容易引起炉内结疤，矿砂燃烧不充分，残渣里还有2％左右的硫被丢弃。而“沸腾炉”结构简单，矿砂进入炉内以后，依靠庞大的鼓风机通入的风力，形成“翻滚式”的炽烈燃烧，很快就能把矿砂中所含的硫烧出。从这两个沸腾炉初试阶段观察，它的生产能力比机械炉大五倍到六倍，矿砂残渣里的含硫量只有0.5％——0.8％，因此大大减少了损失，降低了成本。在某些附属设备再进一步改善以后，这种沸腾炉可以达到全部机械化自动控制，从加料到出灰都不用人工。尤其是在目前硫铁矿供应不足的时候，沸腾式焙烧炉以其优越的燃烧性能，能大量采用含硫量较低的尾砂（磁硫铁矿）来代替好矿，为国家节约宝贵的资源。据估计，这个厂全部机械炉改建后，一年即可利用十多万吨尾砂。
