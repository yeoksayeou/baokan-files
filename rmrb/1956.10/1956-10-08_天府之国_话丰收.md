    Talking About the Harvest in the "Land of Abundance"
    Xinhua News Agency Sichuan Branch
    The intense autumn harvest has begun in the rural areas of Sichuan Province. This year, the land is once again rewarding the working people of this "Land of Abundance" with an abundant harvest. According to preliminary estimates from the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture, the province's total grain output this year may reach 44.5 billion jin, an increase of about 10% compared to the bumper year of 1955.
    These joyful days mark the first autumn after the realization of agricultural cooperation in Sichuan Province. During this time, reporters from the Xinhua News Agency stationed in Sichuan Province conducted visits to various locations.

    Golden "Rice Sea"
    In early September, reporters traveled along the Cheng (du) Guan (xian) highway, which traverses the western Sichuan Plain. The dense network of irrigation canals of the Dujiangyan irrigation system was submerged in a golden "sea of rice." Even standing at the edge of the rice fields, it was difficult to see the people coming and going on the small paths between the fields. When the autumn wind rises, a wave of rice undulates, and the heavy rice ears collide with each other, making a rustling sound that is truly exciting to hear.
    The harvest has fully begun on over six million mu of rice fields on the western Sichuan Plain. These days, everywhere on the vast plains, one can see old women from the agricultural cooperatives delivering tea, health workers carrying medicine kits, and children's teams picking up grains, all busily working among the threshing crowds. In the first few days, reports of good harvests have spread everywhere. The Fuxing Sixth Agricultural Cooperative in Wulong Township, Dayi County, has already harvested more than 210 mu of rice fields, with an average yield of over 634 jin of rice per mu, an increase of over 109 jin per mu compared to last year's average, and the harvest has greatly exceeded the estimated production figures calculated earlier.
    Following the ancient Dujiangyan main canal, the reporter arrived in the southwestern part of the western Sichuan Plain, in the area where the irrigation area was newly expanded this year. Because this area is located at a higher elevation and is at the "tail end" of the water supply, millions of mu of farmland did not have guaranteed irrigation. After the realization of cooperation in this area last winter and this spring, farmers, with the help of the government, built new water diversion channels dozens of li long. Connecting these water diversion channels, they also built thousands of new irrigation ditches, providing guaranteed irrigation for more than 700,000 mu of farmland and turning some dry land into paddy fields. These areas will harvest tens of millions of jin more grain than last year.
    Faced with the abundant harvest, people are predicting the upcoming harvest. Song Wenbin, Secretary of the CPC Wenjiang Prefectural Committee, told reporters: It is estimated that the average yield of more than six million mu of rice in the entire prefecture will increase by 7% compared to the bumper year of 1955, which can increase rice production by more than 220 million jin.

    Spring in Autumn
    On both sides of the Yangtze River, stretching a thousand li from Yibin in the west to Wanxian in the east, the sounds of threshing machines and paddles (old-fashioned farm tools for threshing) reverberate across the fields. Now, in this area of rolling hills, it no longer looks like a golden expanse as in previous years. Large patches of green late-rice seedlings bring the colors of spring to the autumn mountains and fields. On one side, people are harvesting rice ears; on the other side, people are cultivating in the late-rice fields. The songs of threshing and the songs of weeding rise at the same time. This is truly a strange sight that has never been seen in this area before.
    This year, agricultural cooperatives in the three prefectures of Yibin, Luzhou, and Jiangjin along the Yangtze River have planted a total of more than four million mu of double-cropping rice. In August, the early rice of these agricultural cooperatives generally had a bumper harvest, with yields generally above 500 jin. Now, more than four million mu of late rice are growing vigorously. Bumper harvest reports are constantly coming from the medium-maturing rice that is being harvested. The Guxu Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Yibin City recently harvested 3.6 mu of medium-maturing rice, with an average yield of 704 jin of rice per mu, an increase of 14% compared to last year. It is estimated that rice production in these areas can increase by about 10% compared to last year.
    In the places where the medium-maturing rice has just been harvested, new groups of workers have appeared, urging oxen to plow the fields and rushing to plant late-autumn crops such as autumn corn and autumn sweet potatoes. Everywhere, one can see a tense labor picture of farmers "harvesting and plowing at the same time, rushing to harvest and rush to plant."

    In the Old Revolutionary Base Area on the Sichuan-Shaanxi Border
    The Tong (jiang) Nan (jiang) Ba (zhong) area, the famous old revolutionary base area on the Sichuan-Shaanxi border, is now presenting a scene of abundant harvest everywhere. According to Tongjiang County's trial calculation, the county's total grain output this year will increase by more than 30% compared to last year. Ninety-three percent of the members of the county's more than 1,700 agricultural cooperatives will increase their income compared to last year. A military dependent named Dai Zhilan in this county recently wrote a letter to her husband, who is serving in a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, reporting the three major happy events in her family: She herself recently joined the Communist Party of China; she was also rated as a first-class military dependent model at the meeting of representatives of martyrs' and military dependents held in the county; and the family's income increased by 43% compared to last year.
    In Changchi Township, Nanjiang County, Zhou Qizhang, an old man who once served as the chairman of the workers' and peasants' regime in this township, compared the autumn harvest situation in 1933 with this year. He said: In the autumn of 1933, the Kuomintang attacked the base area. At that time, the Party organized women into rice-cutting teams and young people into threshing groups, and helped us harvest the rice under the rain of bullets. After liberation, the Party led us to take the road of cooperation. By the spring of this year, more than 90% of the farmers in the township had joined the agricultural cooperatives. Now, according to the trial calculation of each agricultural cooperative, the total grain output of the township has increased by a maximum of 20% compared to 1954, the year with the largest increase in production after liberation. How can people not be happy!

    Joyful Valley
    In the hilly area of northern Sichuan, intense harvesting work is underway. This year, this area suffered from severe water and drought damage, but the farmers who have taken the road of cooperation, united to build a large number of water conservancy projects, overcame the disasters, and still achieved a bumper harvest. According to preliminary estimates from Suining Prefecture, rice production in the entire prefecture will still increase by 7% compared to last year's bumper harvest. This prefecture alone built more than 4,300 mountain ponds and 25 medium-sized reservoirs last winter and this spring, expanding the irrigation area by more than 580,000 mu, plus the water conservancy projects built in the past few years. More than 81% of the paddy fields in the entire prefecture have been guaranteed irrigation.
    During these days of abundant harvest, reporters heard and saw many inspiring things here. In the past, Zhangjiagou, Ximei Township, Suining County, had more than 300 mu of paddy fields. Because of the drought, many fields could not be planted every year. Since the agricultural cooperative was organized the year before last and a mountain pond capable of irrigating more than 300 mu of farmland was built, this year not only achieved full planting, but also turned more than 40 mu of dry land into paddy fields. Although this year encountered the most severe drought in many years, it still achieved a rare bumper harvest in recent years. The harvested rice has averaged around 600 jin per mu. Now, this place, which had people starving to death due to drought before liberation, has become a joyful valley. In the midst of busy autumn harvest activities, people here sing while harvesting. In the evening, when the noise in the fields stops, the sound of gongs and drums on the courtyard dam rings out. Even Chen Xiwu, a 67-year-old cooperative member, sings folk songs with the young people with great interest.

    New Grain on the Market, Surplus Grain Shipped Out
    With the start of the autumn harvest, farmers in various places are enthusiastically selling new grain to the state. From mid-July to the end of August, farmers throughout the province sold a total of more than 450 million jin of new grain to the state, more than double the amount in the same period last year. At the same time, the work of shipping surplus grain out of the province has also been launched on a large scale. In July and August alone, the province shipped out more than 250,000 tons of rice, flour, and other grains, which is more than the amount of grain shipped out in July, August, and September of last year. Most of this grain is being shipped to Jiangsu, Hebei, Henan, and other places to support the people affected by the disasters.

    “天府之国”话丰收
    新华社四川分社
    四川省农村中紧张的秋收开始了。今年，大地又一次以丰盛的粮食，来酬答这“天府之国”的劳动人们。根据四川省农业厅的初步估计，今年全省的粮食总产量可以达到四百四十五亿斤，将比丰收的1955年增产一成左右。
    这是四川省实现农业合作化后的第一个秋天。在这欢乐的日子里，新华社驻四川省的记者们到各地去作了访问。
    金黄的“稻海”
    九月初，记者沿着横贯川西平原的成（都）灌（县）公路作了一次旅行。密如蛛网的都江堰灌溉渠系，已被金色的“稻海”淹没了。就是站在稻田边上，也很难看见来往在田间小路上的人群。秋风起处，一片稻浪起伏，沉甸的稻穗互相碰撞，发出悉索之声，听来真使人兴奋。
    川西平原上的六百多万亩水稻已经全面开始收割。这几天，在广阔的平原上到处都可以看见农业社里送茶水的老太婆，手提药箱的卫生员和拣粮的儿童队在打谷的人群中忙碌着。在开头的几天里，丰收的喜报已四处传来，大邑县五龙乡复兴第六农业社已收割的二百一十多亩稻田，每亩平均产稻六百三十四斤多，比去年每亩平均增产一百零九斤，收获量已大大超过不久前分配试算的估产数字。
    沿着古老的都江堰干渠，记者来到了川西平原西南部今年新扩大灌溉面积的地区。这一带由于地势较高，又处在“尾水”地位，因此有成百万亩的农田没有灌溉保证。去冬今春这个地区实现合作化以后，农民们在政府的帮助下新修了长达数十里的引水渠道，接连这些引水渠道，又新修了上千条灌溉沟渠，使七十多万亩农田获得了灌溉保证，并使一部分旱地变成了水田。这些地区将比去年多收获上千万斤粮食。
    在丰收的面前，人们都在预测着即将到来的收成，中共温江地委书记宋文彬告诉记者：预计，全专区六百多万亩水稻，平均将比丰收的1955年增产7％，可增产稻谷两亿两千万斤以上。
    秋天里的春天
    在西起宜宾东至万县的千里长江两岸，打谷机声和拌桶（打谷用的旧式农具）声已响彻田野。现在，在这一带浅丘起伏的地方，已经不像往年似的一片金黄，大片的青绿色的晚稻秧苗，给秋天的山野带来了春天的色彩。一边，人们在收割稻穗；另一边，人们却在晚稻田里中耕，打谷的歌声和薅秧的歌声同时响起，这真是这一带从来没有过的奇异景象。
    今年，长江沿岸的宜宾、泸州、江津三个专区的农业社共种植了四百多万亩双季稻。八月里，这些农业社的早稻普遍丰收，产量一般在五百斤以上。现在，四百多万亩晚稻正长得青葱茁壮。正在收割的中熟稻，不断传出了丰收的喜讯。宜宾市郊区古叙农业社在最近收割了三亩六分中熟稻，每亩平均打稻谷七百零四斤，比去年增产14％。据估计，这些地区的水稻可比去年增产一成左右。
    在刚收割完中熟稻的地方，跟着又出现了新的劳动人群，他们吆喝耕牛翻犁田土，赶种秋玉米、秋红薯等晚秋作物，到处都可看到农民们“边收边犁、抢收抢种”的紧张劳动图画。
    在川陕边革命老根据地
    著名的川陕边革命老根据地的通（江）南（江）巴（中）地区，现在到处呈现了丰收的景象。根据通江县试算，这个地处山区的县份今年的粮食总产量将比去年增产三成多，全县一千七百多个农业社的社员，93％能比去年增加收入。这个县一位名叫戴芝兰的军属，最近给她在中国人民解放军某部服务的丈夫写信，报告她家的三大喜事说：她本人在最近加入了中国共产党；她在县里召开的烈、军属代表会上还被评为甲等军属模范；全家比去年增加收入43％。
    在南江县长池乡，曾担任过这个乡的工农政权主席的周其章老大爷，向记者对比了1933年与今年的秋收情况。他说：1933年秋天，国民党向根据地进攻，那时党把妇女们组成割谷队，把年轻人编成打谷组，在枪林弹雨下帮助我们把稻子收了起来。解放后，党领导我们走合作化的道路，到今年春天全乡90％以上农户都加入了农业社。现在，根据各农业社的试算，全乡粮食产量比解放后增产最多的一年——1954年，还要增产两成，怎么不令人高兴！
    欢乐的山谷
    在川北丘陵区，紧张的收割工作正在进行。今年这里曾受到严重的水、旱侵袭，但走上了合作化道路的农民们，联合兴修的大批水利工程，战胜了灾害，仍然取得了丰产。据遂宁专区的初步估计，全区水稻仍将比丰收的去年增产7％。这个专区仅在去冬今春就兴修了四千三百多口山弯塘和二十五座中型水库，共扩大灌溉面积五十八万多亩，加上过去几年兴修的水利工程。全专区81％以上的稻田已获得灌溉的保证。
    在这丰收的日子里，记者在这里听到和看到了许多令人振奋的事情。遂宁县西眉乡张家沟过去有三百多亩稻田，因为干旱，年年都有许多田栽插不上。自从前年组织起农业社，兴修了一口能灌三百多亩农田的山弯塘后，今年不但做到满栽满插，还把四十多亩旱地变成了水田。今年虽然遇到了多年来最严重的旱灾，但仍然获得近几年来少有的丰收，已收割的水稻每亩平均都在六百斤上下，现在，这个解放前曾经因为旱灾而饿死过人的地方，已经变成了一个欢乐的山谷。在繁忙的秋收活动中，这里的人们一面收割一面歌唱。晚上，田野上的喧嚷声一停，院坝上的锣鼓声便响起来了。连六十七岁的老社员陈昔武，也兴致勃勃地和年轻人一道唱山歌。
    新粮上市，余粮外运
    随着秋收的开始，各地农民正在踊跃地把新粮卖给国家。从7月中到8月底，全省农民卖给国家的新粮共达四亿五千多万斤，比去年同期增加两倍以上。与此同时，全省外运余粮的工作也大规模地展开了。单是七、八两月份全省外运的大米、面粉等就有二十五万多吨，比去年七、八、九三个月外运的粮食还要多。这些粮食大部分是运往江苏、河北、河南等地支援受灾人民的。
