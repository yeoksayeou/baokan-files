	"Special Circumstances"
	Shou'an Town in Pujiang County, Sichuan Province, and Huilong Town in Qionglai County are adjacent areas, and small vendors from both places used to travel freely. In recent years, the financial departments of Shou'an Town have consistently adopted a blockade policy, prohibiting small vendors from other counties from doing business in the town. The financial departments of Qionglai County asked them to open up, but they were unreasonably rejected.
	On September 20th, small vendors from Huilong Town went to the market. Comrades from the Shou'an Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Tax Bureau, Market Management Committee, and An, the director of the local Federation of Industry and Commerce, collectively came to prevent them from setting up stalls and doing business, deliberately making things difficult and preventing the masses from buying their goods. The reason they refuse foreign vendors is that they emphasize the "special circumstances" of Shou'an Town. They believe that Shou'an Town is small and has many small vendors. If foreign vendors are allowed to operate, it will affect the income of small vendors in Shou'an Town. Our view is the opposite: only by abolishing the blockade policy and enlivening the market can the income of small vendors be increased. —Reader

    “特殊情况”
    四川蒲江县的寿安镇和邛崃县的回龙市是毗邻地区，两地的小商贩过去经常自由往来。近几年来，寿安镇的财经部门一直采取封锁政策，不许外县小商贩到镇上来经营。邛崃县财经部门曾要他们开放，都被他们无理拒绝了。
    9月20日，回龙市小商贩过去赶集。寿安镇供销社、税务所、市场管理委员会等单位的同志和当地工商联的安主任，集体前来阻止他们摆摊营业，有意刁难，不准群众买他们的东西。他们拒绝外来商贩经营的原因，是强调了寿安镇的“特殊情况”，他们认为寿安镇地方小，小商贩多，如果允许外来商贩来经营，就会影响寿安镇小商贩的收入。我们的看法则相反，只有撤销封锁政策，活跃市场，才能增加小商贩的收入。　—读者
