Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, October 28th: Agricultural producers' cooperatives in Zhejiang Province are actively preparing for income distribution work. The compilation of trial calculation plans is underway throughout the province. According to statistics from over 33,000 cooperatives, more than 14,600 cooperatives have either completed or are in the process of compiling trial calculation plans, accounting for over 34%. It is expected that this work will be basically completed by mid-November, after which the distribution phase can begin.

This year, Zhejiang Province has been continuously affected by natural disasters such as typhoons, droughts, and floods, impacting more than half of the province's counties. However, due to the immense superiority demonstrated by agricultural cooperatives in production, the vast majority of cooperatives are still striving to increase the income of over 90% of their members. According to statistics from relevant departments covering over 26,300 cooperatives, 76.97% of the cooperatives can achieve or strive to achieve income increases for over 90% of their members. According to a review of 101 cooperatives in the Jiaxing Special District that have completed their trial calculation plans, 92 cooperatives are able to achieve income increases for 90% of their members. More than 20% of the cooperatives across the province are currently unable to achieve income increases for 90% of their members. They are vigorously developing diversified production to strive for more new income and minimize the scope of income reduction as much as possible.

Whether the autumn harvest distribution this year is reasonable or not is of utmost importance, as it relates to the consolidation of cooperatives and agricultural production next year. Party committees at all levels in the province attach great importance to this work and have made relatively thorough preparations in terms of ideology, organization, and material conditions. Many counties have designated county party secretaries, deputy secretaries, or standing committee members to specifically lead the distribution work. Various counties in the Ningbo Special District have also established committees, offices, and headquarters to lead the autumn harvest distribution work.

    浙江积极准备秋收分配工作
    各地正在编造试算方案
    新华社杭州28日电　浙江省农业生产合作社积极准备收益分配工作。编造试算方案，正在全省范围内进行。据三万三千多个社的统计，试算方案编造好的和正在编造的社有一万四千六百多个，占34％以上。预计这一工作到11月中旬基本结束。往后就可以转入到分配的阶段了。
    浙江省今年连续受到风、旱、水等自然灾害，受灾面涉及到全省半数以上的县份，但由于农业社在生产上显示出的巨大优越性，绝大部分社仍能争取90％以上的社员增加收入。据有关部门对二万六千三百多个社的统计，有76.97％的社能达到和争取达到90％以上社员增加收入。根据嘉兴专区已编造好试算方案的一百零一个社的检查，有九十二个社能够达到90％社员增加收入。全省还有20％以上不能达到90％以上社员增加收入的社，目前正在大力开展多样性的生产，力争多得一些新的收入，把减少收入的面尽量缩小到最低限度。
    今年的秋收分配合理与否，关系合作社的巩固和明年的农业生产，关系极为重大。全省各级中共党委都很重视这一工作，并且从思想上、组织上和物质条件的准备上，做得比较充分。不少县确定了县委书记、副书记或常委专门来领导分配工作。宁波专区各县还成立了委员会、办公室、指挥部等领导秋收分配工作的机构。
