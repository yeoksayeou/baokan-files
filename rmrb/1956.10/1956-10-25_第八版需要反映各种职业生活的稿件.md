      The eighth edition needs manuscripts reflecting various occupational lives
      Although "Entering School" describes a small matter, it has its touching aspects. In our society, joyful and inspiring things happen every day and every hour, and they require people with a heart to record and depict them.
    The eighth edition welcomes readers to submit such manuscripts. It is hoped that readers from all walks of life, as well as writers and journalists, will use short pieces to reflect the new face, new morality, and new customs of our society, to reflect interesting things and exemplary deeds in various occupational lives, to reflect how people in industries that were despised in the old society are living a brand new life, and to reflect people's new ideals and pursuits. We hope to get the support of a wide range of amateur authors, so that the eighth edition can regularly select and publish such articles, in order to arouse people's concern for all aspects of social life, and respect and love for labor and creation. The Editor

      第八版需要反映各种职业生活的稿件
      “入学”所描写的虽则是件小事情，却有其动人心弦的地方。在我们社会里，令人欢欣鼓舞的事每日每时在发生，它们要求着有心的人们来纪录，来描绘。
    第八版欢迎读者投寄这类稿件。希望各行各业的读者，以及作家和记者们，用短小的篇幅来反映我们社会的新的面貌，新的道德和风尚，反映各种职业生活中有趣的事情，模范的事迹，反映在旧社会受轻视的行业的人们怎样过着崭新的生活，反映人们的新的理想和追求。我们希望得到广大业余作者的支持，使八版能够经常选登这类文章，以引起人们对各方面社会生活的关切，对劳动、创造的尊重和热爱。　编者
