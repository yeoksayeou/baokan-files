Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 9th - According to the Albanian Telegraph Agency, the Albanian Labor Party delegation that attended the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, led by First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, Hoxha, returned to Tirana on the afternoon of the 7th.

At a mass meeting to welcome the delegation's return, Hoxha said that the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China was not only a matter of great significance for the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, but also for the international communist movement and the workers' movement. The Congress summarized the victories already achieved by the Chinese people and stipulated the tasks for the future. We have learned many useful things from its work and from the experience of the Communist Party of China.

The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China prominently demonstrated the respect and sincere love that Chinese Communists and the Chinese people hold for the Soviet people and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

This Congress showed the close connection between the Party and the great Chinese people. The correct line followed by the Communist Party of China has made it possible for the broad masses of the people to unite with the Party, and has also made it possible for the national bourgeoisie, all progressive and patriotic people from all strata, and intellectuals to accept the leadership of the Party and fight shoulder to shoulder with the working people for a prosperous and progressive People's China. Wherever we went, we felt the close connection between the Communist Party and the people. He said that in every place and in every person, we saw enthusiasm and confidence in the future, as well as love for the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong.

Hoxha continued, saying that the Chinese people are our close and very dear friends. In the hearts of the Chinese working people, there is a deep love for our people. We personally experienced this everywhere. They are extremely interested in the situation of our country. The leaders of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government also have this kind of love and concern for our country. Comrade Mao Zedong said that the Albanian people are heroic and militant people. He told us that the Albanian people will always receive the fraternal assistance of the Chinese people on the road to building socialism. Comrade Mao Zedong said: This is our internationalist obligation to the Albanian people.

Hoxha said, comrades, let us maintain and further develop this precious friendship, this friendship that unites our people with the fraternal Chinese people.

    并指出中国和阿尔巴尼亚在建设社会主义的道路上将互相支援
    新华社布拉格9日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，参加中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表团，在劳动党中央委员会第一书记霍查的率领下，7日下午回到了地拉那。
    霍查在一次欢迎代表团回国的群众大会上说，中国共产党第八次全国代表大会不仅对中国共产党和中国人民来说是一件有重大意义的事情，而且对国际共产主义运动和工人运动来说也是一件有重大意义的事情。代表大会总结了中国人民已经取得的胜利并且规定了今后的任务。我们从它的工作中，从中国共产党的经验中，学到了许多有用的东西。
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会上突出地表现了中国共产党员和中国人民对苏联人民和苏联共产党所抱有的尊敬和真诚的热爱。
    这次代表大会显示了党和伟大的中国人民的紧密联系。中国共产党所遵循的正确路线使广大的人民群众有可能和党团结一致，也使民族资产阶级、各阶层的一切进步和爱国人士以及知识分子有可能接受党的领导，并且和劳动人民肩并肩地为了一个繁荣和进步的人民中国而斗争。在我们到过的任何地方，我们都体会到了共产党和人民的紧密联系。他说，在每一个地方和每一个人的身上，我们都看到了热诚和对未来的信心，以及对共产党和毛泽东同志的热爱。
    霍查接着说，中国人民是我们的亲切的和十分可爱的朋友。在中国劳动人民的心中有着对我国人民的深刻的热爱。我们到处都亲身体会到这一点。他们对我国的生活情况极感兴趣。中国共产党和中国政府的领导者们对我们的国家同样有着这种热爱和关怀。毛泽东同志说，阿尔巴尼亚人民是英勇的、富有战斗性的人民。他告诉我们说，阿尔巴尼亚人民在建设社会主义的道路上将永远得到中国人民的兄弟般的援助。毛泽东同志说：这是我们对阿尔巴尼亚人民的国际主义的义务。
    霍查说，同志们，让我们保持并且进一步发展这种珍贵的友谊，这种把我国人民和兄弟的中国人民团结在一起的友谊。
