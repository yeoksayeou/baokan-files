Xinhua News Agency report: The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Supervisory Committee and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region People's Committee Supervisory Office recently seriously handled the gas poisoning case at the Liudaowan Coal Mine.

Toxic gas was discovered at the Liudaowan Coal Mine as early as July 12th, and workers were injured by it. On July 18th, many more workers were overcome by the gas. Wei Zhennan, the deputy mine manager who bore the primary administrative leadership responsibility, still disregarded the gas problem at a mine affairs meeting. Workers repeatedly requested him to seal off the source of the gas and resolve the issues of manpower and materials for sealing, but he repeatedly prevaricated and delayed. It was not until July 25th, after the number of worker poisoning cases reached 230, that permanent sealing measures were implemented in the gas-affected area, under the supervision of the Party Committee Secretary and the mine manager who had just returned from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region People's Congress.

In order to improve the mine's safety facilities, the Autonomous Region's Department of Industry allocated 88,000 yuan for safety measures this year. However, in addition to spending 23,800 yuan on equipment purchases, the mine hoarded most of the money. Many basic safety equipment items, such as safety helmets, rubber shoes, and waterproof clothing, were lacking, and workers had to carry out production in extremely dangerous and difficult conditions. Before 1953, the Xinjiang Provincial Department of Industry specifically organized the mine's employees to study new coal mining methods in the interior to help the mine change its backward coal mining methods, but these methods were never adopted in the mine's main production processes.

Deputy Mine Manager Wei Zhennan, as a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Mine Area Committee, usually despised and resisted the leadership of the Party Committee, attacked the Party Committee Secretary, and was the main person responsible for this accident. He was given the disciplinary measures of being placed on probation within the Party for one year and being removed from his administrative post. The mine manager and other relevant personnel were also given appropriate disciplinary actions. The Autonomous Region's Department of Industry, the Coal Mine Administration Bureau, and the CPC Urumqi Municipal Committee also bear certain responsibility for the errors at the Liudaowan Coal Mine. It was decided that they should conduct separate reviews and assist the mine in improving the collective leadership of the Party Committee to ensure safe production.

### 新疆严肃处理六道湾矿瓦斯伤人事件  忽视安全的失职人员受到处分

    新疆严肃处理六道湾矿瓦斯伤人事件
    忽视安全的失职人员受到处分
    据新华社讯　中共新疆维吾尔自治区监察委员会和新疆维吾尔自治区人民委员会监察厅最近严肃处理了六道湾煤矿瓦斯中毒案件。
    六道湾煤矿在7月12日就发现了有毒气体，并且熏伤了工人。到7月18日又有许多工人被熏倒，当时负主要行政领导责任的副矿长魏振南在矿务会议上，对瓦斯问题还置之不理。工人数次向他请求密闭瓦斯来源和解决密闭的人力和材料问题，他却一再推诿拖延。直到7月25日，工人中毒已达二百三十人次之后，才在党委书记和刚由中共新疆维吾尔自治区代表大会回矿的矿长督促下，对瓦斯发生区域实行了永久密闭措施。
    为了改善该矿安全设施，自治区工业厅今年曾拨给安全措施费用八万八千元，但是该矿除支出了二万三千八百元的器材购置费外，把绝大部分钱都积压起来。许多最起码的安全设备如安全帽、胶鞋、防水衣等都没有，工人们不得不在极其危险、艰苦的条件下进行生产。1953年前新疆省工业厅为了帮助该矿改变落后的采煤方法，曾专门组织该矿职工到内地学习新采煤方法，但是一直没有在该矿的主要生产过程中采用。
    副矿长魏振南身为中共矿区委员会常委，平时蔑视和对抗党委领导，打击党委书记，又是这次事故的主要责任者，被给予党内留党察看一年、行政上撤职的处分。该矿矿长和有关人员也受到应得的处分。自治区工业厅、煤矿管理局和中共乌鲁木齐市委对于六道湾煤矿的错误也负有一定的责任，决定由他们分别检查，并协助这个矿健全党委的集体领导，保证安全生产。
