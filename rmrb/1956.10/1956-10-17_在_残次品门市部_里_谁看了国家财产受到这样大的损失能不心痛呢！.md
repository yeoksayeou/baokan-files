    In the "Defective Products Outlet"
    Who Wouldn't Feel the Pain Seeing Such a Great Loss of State Property!
    ·Li Qian·
    Whenever you walk along the most bustling street in Xi'an – near the Bell Tower on East Street – you can see many customers buying things in the defective products outlet of the Xi'an Department Store. This defective products outlet has a wide and beautiful storefront, displaying enameled mugs, plain and patterned washbasins, chamber pots, various iron-cased thermos bottles, large and small aluminum pots, canvas suitcases, waxed cloth suitcases, painted cloth suitcases, briefcases, mimeograph machines, and more. On the knitwear shelves, there are towels of various colors, wool sweaters and pants, cotton undershirts and pants, vests, socks, raincoats, shirts, etc. In addition, there are various toys, soaps, flashlights... Truly, "everything is available."
    When I visited the knitwear sales department, the head of the outlet introduced me to the fact that these pink and red wool sweaters became defective because they were left on the shelves or in the warehouse for too long, and the folded areas faded in color. If the sales staff or warehouse staff were just a little more diligent, flipping the folds or selling the earlier stock first instead of storing it for too long, they wouldn't have become defective. Raincoats and vests, which were originally of good quality, also became defective due to this reason, now appearing with uneven patches of dark and light color. A new raincoat is worth more than twenty yuan, but now it's fifteen yuan and still no one wants it. The salesperson then took down a patterned silk dress for me to see. He said with great distress that this dress, with its novel design and good material, had its color faded in the sun due to being displayed in the window for too long. If each store could regularly rotate its displays, customers would not only see a greater variety, but it would also prevent goods from becoming defective. However, many store clerks and warehouse staff do not do this. Many goods become defective due to being displays. In the first half of this year alone, this defective products outlet sold more than one hundred silk shirts, with the price dropping from more than twelve yuan to more than seven yuan each.
    On another shelf, I saw many wool sweaters, towels, bed sheets, and shirts with holes gnawed by mice. According to the sales staff, they recently sold more than a dozen satin children's capes that had been chewed by mice.
    Those iron-cased thermos bottles, washbasins, and mugs were broken or had their enamel chipped off because people didn't handle them carefully during transportation, failing to handle them with care. Some washbasins had yellow spots because the rice straw used to pack the basins had become damp and stained the basins yellow. If the warehouse staff had promptly noticed that the boxes containing enamelware were damp and opened them to air them out, these basins wouldn't have changed color.
    Thus, due to the carelessness of the warehouse staff and sales staff, the Xi'an Department Store's defective products outlet has never had any problem with its source of goods in the two years since it was established; the source of goods is not decreasing, but increasing. Among them, the Xi'an Department Store purchasing and supply station alone sent over 13,000 yuan worth of enamelware and more than 2,700 yuan worth of knitwear from May to July this year. The turnover of the defective products outlet is increasing month by month. Last year, the average monthly sales were two to three thousand yuan, and in the first quarter of this year, the average monthly sales were five to six thousand yuan. Since June, the monthly sales have been above ten thousand yuan.
    The staff of the defective products outlet are not happy about the increase in the source of goods and sales volume. Because what they hope for is not an increase in defective products, but a gradual decrease, or even their elimination. Wu Zhenzhong, the leader of the sales team in this outlet, said: "Every time our sales staff sell a piece of goods, we feel both happy and sad. We are happy that the defective products have been processed, reducing the backlog of defective goods; we are sad that goods that were originally worth ten yuan can now only be sold for five yuan here, or even less, which causes a great loss to state property." In order to reduce the loss of state property, they have thought of many ways to turn defective goods into good goods. For example, in the first half of this year, they received dozens of parasols with broken handles that were unusable and difficult to sell. Therefore, they paid attention to finding good parasol handles, and later found some parasol handles in the Xi'an Department Store purchasing and supply station. After replacing them, they became good goods. They also contacted factories that produce rubber shoes, asking the factories to match single rubber shoes into pairs or exchange them, so that they could also turn defective goods into good goods.
    After receiving the goods, the staff of the defective products outlet always carefully inspect them. During the inspection, they found that some units also sent good goods to the defective products outlet, and they returned them after raising their opinions to the sending units. Once, the Xi'an Daily Necessities First Wholesale Department sent eight fluorescent lamps, saying that they were all broken and unusable, and the price was reduced from more than thirty yuan each to fifty cents each. After receiving these fluorescent lamps, the salesperson Li Shouyin asked an electrician to inspect them. As a result, it was found that only four of the eight lamps were broken, and the remaining four had no problems at all. Although the staff of the defective products outlet have made great efforts to reduce the loss of state property, they cannot fundamentally reduce the number of defective products; because in the wholesale stations, warehouses, and stores of the department store, a large number of defective products are still being continuously manufactured!
    There are so many goods stored in the defective products warehouse, and the variety is so complete. In addition to the goods displayed in the outlet, there are also many children's shoes, children's clothing, sneakers, cotton shoes, pillows, etc. And in the yard, there are still many people sorting out the newly delivered defective goods. It seems that the small warehouse cannot hold them. No wonder the staff of this outlet are saddened by so many defective products. Who wouldn't feel the pain seeing such a great loss of state property!

### 在“残次品门市部”里  谁看了国家财产受到这样大的损失能不心痛呢！

    在“残次品门市部”里
    谁看了国家财产受到这样大的损失能不心痛呢！
    ·李茜·
    每当你走过西安市最繁华的街道——东大街钟楼附近的时候，便可以看到许多顾客在西安市百货公司的残次品门市部里买东西。这个残次品门市部，门面宽大、漂亮，里边陈列着搪瓷口杯、花素面盆、便盆、各色铁壳热水瓶、大小铝锅和帆布箱、腊布箱、漆布箱、公事包、油印机等。在针织品的货架上，有各色毛巾、绒衣绒裤、棉毛衫裤、背心、袜子、雨衣、衬衫等。另外，还有各种玩具、香皂、手电筒……。真是“应有尽有”。
    当我参观针织品售货部的时候，门市部主任向我介绍说，这些粉红色和红色的绒衣，是因为放在货架上或仓库里的时间较久，折叠的地方颜色变浅而成残品的。如果售货员或保管人员稍微手勤一点，把折叠的印子翻动一下，或者把先来的货先卖出去，不要存放太久，就不会变残了。由于这种原因变残的还有原来质量很好的雨衣和背心，现在，也变成深一块浅一块的颜色了。一件新雨衣价值二十多元，现在十五元一件还没人要。售货员又拿下一件花绸连衣裙给我看，他很难过的对我说，这件样子又新，料子又好的连衣裙，是因为在橱窗里陈列的时间过长，向阳的地方变了颜色。如果各门市部能够经常调换陈列品，不但顾客看起来花样又多，同时也不会使商品变残。可是许多商店的营业员和保管员却没有这样作。由陈列品变成残品的货物很多，今年上半年这个残次品门市部光绸料衬衣就卖了一百多件，价钱从十二元多降到七元多一件。
    在另外一个货架子上，我又看到不少被老鼠咬成洞的绒衣、毛巾、床单和衬衣等。据售货员们说，他们不久以前还推销了十几个被老鼠咬破的缎料小孩斗篷。
    那些铁壳热水瓶、面盆和口杯等，都是在搬运的时候没有注意轻拿轻放，而碰碎或碰掉搪瓷的。还有一些带有黄色斑点的面盆，是因为包盆子的稻草受了潮，把盆子染成黄色的。如果保管人员及时发现装搪瓷品的箱子受潮，打开晾一下，这些盆子就不会变色了。
    就这样，由于保管人员和营业员的漫不经心，西安市百货公司残次品门市部成立两年多来，货源从来没有发生过什么问题；货源不是越来越少，而是越来越多。其中仅西安市百货采购供应站在今年5月到7月就送来价值一万三千多元的搪瓷品和两千七百多元的针织品。残次品门市部的营业额逐月上升。去年平均每月卖两、三千元，今年第一季度平均每月五、六千元，从6月份以后，每月都在万元以上。
    货源和销售额增加了，残次品门市部的工作人员并不因此而高兴。因为他们希望的不是残次商品的增加，而是逐渐减少，甚至没有。这个门市部的售货小组长武振中说：“我们售货员每卖出一件货物的时候，心里是又高兴又难过。高兴的是把残品处理完了，减少了残货的积压；难过的是明明原来值十块钱的货物，现在我们这里只能卖五元，甚至还要少，这就使国家财产受到很大损失。为了使国家财产少受损失，他们曾想了不少办法把残货变成好货。如今年上半年他们收到几十把阳伞，伞把已破的不能用了，很难卖出去。于是，他们就注意找好的伞把，后来在西安市百货采购供应站里找到了一些伞把，换上以后，就变成好货了。他们还同生产胶鞋的工厂联系，请厂子里给单只胶鞋配成一双，或调换一下，这样也能把残货变成好货。
    残次品门市部的工作人员收到货物以后，总是仔细地检查。在检查中，他们发现有些单位把好货也送到残次品门市部，就向送货单位提出意见后退回去。有一次，西安市日用百货第一批发部送来八个日光灯，据说都是坏的不能用了，售价由三十多元一个降到五角钱一个。售货员李守印接到这些日光灯后，就请修理电灯的工人来检查。结果发现八个灯中，只有四个是坏的，其余四个一点毛病也没有。虽然残次品门市部的工作人员为了减少国家财产的损失，已经尽了很大的努力，但是并不能使残次品从根本上减少；因为在百货公司的批发站里、仓库里和门市部里，还在继续不断地制造大量的残次品呢！
    存放在残次品仓库里的货物是那样多，品种又是那么齐全，除门市部里摆的货物外，还有许多童鞋、童装、球鞋、棉鞋、枕头等。而在院子里还有很多人在那里整理着新送来的残货，看样子小仓库里是放不下了。难怪这个门市部的工作人员要为这样多的残次品而难过，谁看了国家财产受到这样大的损失能不心痛呢！
