    Qingdao Alginate Factory
    (Our dispatch) An alginate factory with an annual output of 150 tons of powdered alginate (scientifically known as sodium alginate) is under construction in Qingdao. It is expected to begin installing machinery in mid-November. After the completion of the first phase of the project by the end of this year, the annual output will reach 40 tons.
    Alginate is extracted from a type of seaweed called Sargassum, which grows naturally in shallow seas. The basic extraction method was successfully developed two years ago by Dr. Zeng Chengkui, Deputy Director of the Institute of Oceanography of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Ji Minghou, Assistant Researcher at the institute. Sargassum is produced in large quantities along the coast of China. Alginate has a wide range of uses. In the food and pharmaceutical industries, alginate can almost completely replace gum as a binder. It can be used to make ice cream, toothpaste, and pills. When a housewife is cooking, adding a little alginate to the soup can create a thick soup. Coating fabric with another component of alginate makes it waterproof. Fiber can also be extracted from alginate to weave fireproof fabric. Alginate can also be used as an elastic impression material (impression paste) for dental impressions. When alginate is used in the textile industry, it can completely replace grain starch for sizing yarn and dyeing cloth, and it is the best thickening agent for preparing color pastes for printing and dyeing patterned fabrics.

    青岛海藻胶厂
    本报讯　一个年产一百五十吨粉末海藻胶（学名叫褐藻酸钠）的海藻胶厂正在青岛兴建，预计11月中旬就可以开始安装机器，到本年底第一期工程完成后，年产量就将达到四十吨。
    海藻胶是从浅海里天然生长的一种叫作马尾藻的海藻中提取出来的。它的基本的提取方法是中国科学院海洋生物研究室副主任曾呈奎博士和该研究室助理研究员纪明候在两年前研究成功的。马尾藻在我国沿海有大量出产。海藻胶的用途很广。在食品工业和制药业中，海藻胶几乎可以全部代替树胶作为粘合剂，做冰激凌、做牙膏、做药片都可以用它；主妇烹调时，在汤里稍加点海藻胶，就可以得到一盆浓汤。用另一种成分的海藻胶涂在布面上，就成为防雨布。也可以从海藻胶中抽出纤维来织造防火布。海藻胶还可以作为镶牙采型用的弹性印模材料（打样膏）。海藻胶运用在纺织工业中，可以完全代替粮食淀粉浆纱染布，并且是调制印染花色布色浆的最好糊料。
