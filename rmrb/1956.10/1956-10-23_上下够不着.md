    Stuck in Between
    You Mei
    When I was little, I heard adults say that the most pitiful animal in the world was the bat. It sought refuge with the birds, but the birds said, "You are viviparous, so you are a mammal. You are not allowed to join our ranks!" It sought refuge with the mammals, but the mammals said, "You can fly, so you are a bird. We don't have anyone like you here!" So, I felt very sorry for this innocent animal. I was also puzzled about what kind of creature it was.
    As I grew older, I had more things to worry about, so I didn't have time to worry about bats anymore. Unexpectedly, recently something happened that reminded me of this story again.
    There is a foreman who is very good at his job. He is always rated as first or second class in his performance evaluations, but he has never received a bonus. When I asked others, I learned that although he is doing the work of a cadre, his position is that of a worker. Therefore, no matter how great his work performance is, or what level he is rated, he is not qualified to receive the cadre's bonus. Not only is he not eligible for bonuses, but he is also not eligible for the site allowance that cadres receive monthly. He is also not eligible to participate in the promotion and ranking of cadres.
    So, he should have the rights that workers enjoy, right?
    Not so. Because he is doing the work of a cadre and is not directly involved in production, he is naturally not eligible for piece-rate excess bonuses, nor is he eligible to participate in production competitions. He is also not eligible for worker upgrades or salary evaluations – what level of worker is he, who spends all day issuing orders and making plans?
    This reminds me of bats. However, bats are naturally that kind of animal, while these comrades are placed in this "stuck in between" position by the leading cadres.
    If there were only one or two such cadres, it could be said to be an "individual problem." However, every construction site I have been to has them, and there is more than one.
    If these people were only temporarily acting as cadres, it would be acceptable. However, I have seen them working for a year or two. The "foreman" mentioned above has been working for a full two years and four months this October!
    If it is said that they were not familiar with the work of cadres at the beginning and needed to "intern" for a period of time, haven't they become familiar with it by now? Even a technical secondary school only takes two or three years to graduate! To take a step back, even if these people have many problems and cannot be formally transferred to cadres, they should be asked to return to production. What's the point of hanging them there?
    Because of this matter, some comrades have raised opinions to the labor and wage, personnel and other departments more than once, but the problem has not been solved. The reason is very simple: if these people are transferred to formal cadres, the personnel department will be responsible for the promotion if something goes wrong in the future! In addition, once these people's names are on the cadre roster, wouldn't it show that the management structure is large and the staff exceeds the quota? It's better now, because it not only completes the work that should be done, but also does not bear the responsibility of promoting cadres, and it can't be checked how many cadres there are.
    To solve this problem, it's also very simple. Just put the leaders of the labor and wage and personnel departments in the "stuck in between" position for two months and let them experience the difficulties of this type of cadre! Unfortunately, no one has done this yet.
    Notes:
    1. Originally, these words should have been said by the parties themselves, but they have their own difficulties. In our lives, the phenomenon of "labeling" has not disappeared. Not working hard? This is individualism! Wanting to be transferred to a formal cadre is the idea of climbing up, and should be criticized! Asking to return to the team will inevitably be labeled as "willing to fall behind."
    2. After this short article was written, I heard that the × department is going to take new measures to solve this problem. In the future, similar cadres mentioned above will be rotated by workers, every two months and twenty-nine days. Because the Labor Bureau has issued an order that all workers who have worked as cadres for more than three months will be transferred to formal cadres!
    In this way, the "cadres" who are stuck in between will not decrease, but will increase.

    上下够不着
    右枚
    小时听大人讲，世界上最可怜的动物算蝙蝠。他投靠鸟类，鸟说：“你是胎生的，算兽类，不许参加我们阵营！”他投靠兽，兽则说：“你会飞，算鸟类，我们这儿没你这一号！”于是，我就很为这无辜的动物伤心。也很纳闷，他到底算哪一类呢？
    年纪一大，该过问的事情多了，便没功夫再替蝙蝠焦心。没想到，最近却有件事情又叫我把这故事想起来了。
    有位工作挺出色的工长，每次考绩都被评上甲等或乙等奖，却从来没见他领过奖金。一问旁人，才知道他虽然作的是干部的工作，职务却是工人，所以不管他工作的成绩多大，被评为几等，干部的奖金他是没资格拿的。不仅没资格领奖金，干部们按月领工地津贴，他也没份，干部们提升，评级，他也没资格参加。
    那么，工人所享有的权利他该有了吧！
    也不然。因为他作的是干部工作，不直接生产，计件超额奖自然没份，生产竞赛也没资格参加，工人升级、评薪也没有他的份——他成天下命令、作计划，算那一级的工人呢？
    这叫我想起蝙蝠来了。不过蝙蝠是天生的那种动物，而这些同志却是由领导干部们送到这上下够不着的地位上来的。
    这类干部若只有一两个，也还可以说是“个别问题”，偏偏我到过的工地都有，都不止一个。
    这些人若仅仅是临时性的作代理干部的工作，也还可将就，偏偏我看见的都作了一两年了，上边说的那位“工长”，到今年10月已作了整整两年零四个月！
    若说开始时他们对干部工作不熟悉，要“实习”一个时期，难道，到现在他们还不熟悉？中等技术学校也只两三年就毕业呀！退一步说，就算这些人问题很多，根本不能转为正式干部，那也该叫人家归队生产呀，总吊在那儿算怎么回事？
    为这事，有些同志不止一次地向劳动工资、人事等部门提过意见，问题照样没有解决。原因很简单：要把这些人转为正式干部，以后万一出了什么事，人事部门要负提拔的责任！另外，这些人名一登上干部名册，那不就看出管理机构庞大，人员超过编制了吗？那如现在好，既完成了应作的工作，又不负提拔干部的责任，还检查不出到底有多少干部来。
    要解决这问题，也很简单。只要把劳动工资、人事部门的领导人员放在“上下够不着”的地位上呆上两个月，让他们体验一下这类干部的苦衷就行了！可惜目前没有人这么办。
    附注：
    一、本来这些话是应该由当事人自己说，但他们有他们的苦衷，在我们生活中，扣帽子的现象还没绝迹。不安心工作吗？这是个人主义！想转正式干部，是往上爬的思想，该批评！要求归队，又难免被加上个“自甘后退”的名目。
    二、这篇短文写完后，又听说×部门对此问题要采取新措施了。以后类似上述的干部要由工人轮流担任，每期两月零二十九天。因为，劳动局下了命令，凡作三个月以上干部工作的工人，一律转正式干部！
    这样一来，上下够不着的“干部”将不是减少，而是更多了。
