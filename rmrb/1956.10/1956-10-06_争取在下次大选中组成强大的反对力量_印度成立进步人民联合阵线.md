Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 4th. Election campaign activities of various political parties in India continue to unfold. At a meeting of some political parties held in Lucknow, the Progressive People's United Front of Uttar Pradesh was established.

According to newspaper reports, participants in the meeting included representatives from the Communist Party of India, the newly formed "Congress Opposition Organization," the Revolutionary Socialist Party, the All India Forward Bloc, the Peasants and Workers Party (the Uttar Pradesh section that did not previously merge with the Praja Socialist Party), the Depressed Classes League (a local political organization claiming to strive against all forms of exploitation), and other individuals totaling two hundred and twenty-five people.

Although invited, the Praja Socialist Party and the Socialist Party led by Lohia did not attend the meeting. Some members of the Praja Socialist Party and the Socialist Party in Uttar Pradesh participated in the meeting in their individual capacities.

The resolution of the meeting stated that the purpose of establishing this front is "to enable all democratic forces to strive for a strong opposition force in the next general election."

The resolution also called attention to the people's increasingly heavy tax burden and the need for improvement in the tax system.

Former Finance Minister of Uttar Pradesh and leader of the Congress Opposition Organization, Paliwal, was elected chairman of the front's standing committee. It has three secretaries: Z.A. Ahmad, a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of India; Sakena, a member of the Indian Parliament; and Chedilal Sathi, a non-partisan person.

The meeting decided that the Progressive People's United Front should have a minimum common program, and each constituent party can retain and publicize the policies in its own program.

Later, on October 3rd in Lucknow, Paliwal told a "Statesman" reporter that the Progressive People's United Front would invite the Praja Socialist Party and the Socialist Party to join based on the minimum common program. If that could not be achieved, it would consult with the Progressive People's United Front on election arrangements to ensure a planned competition with Congress candidates. He expressed hope that the Praja Socialist Party's annual meeting to be held soon in Calcutta would accept the proposal made by Jayaprakash Narayan regarding reaching an agreement with left-wing parties on electoral issues. He also announced that the common program of the Progressive People's United Front would be published soon.

    争取在下次大选中组成强大的反对力量
    印度成立进步人民联合阵线
    新华社新德里4日电　印度各政党的竞选活动继续展开。在勒克瑙举行的一些政党的会议上成立了北方省的进步人民联合阵线。
    据报纸报道，参加这次会议的有印度共产党，新成立的“国大党反对组织”，革命社会党，全印前进同盟，农工人民党（先前没有和人民社会党合并的北方省部分），被剥削者同盟（声言为反对各种剥削而努力的地方性政治组织）的代表和其它人士二百二十五人。
    人民社会党和洛希亚所领导的社会党虽然被邀请，但是没有参加会议。人民社会党和社会党在北方省的一些党员以个人身份参加了会议。
    会议的决议说，成立这个阵线的目的是“使一切民主力量争取在下次大选中组成强有力的反对力量。”
    决议还要求人们注意人民的日益沉重的赋税负担，注意税制的改进。
    北方省前财政部长、国大党反对组织领袖帕利华尔当选为阵线的常设委员会主席、下设三个秘书——印度共产党政治局委员兹·阿·艾哈迈德，印度议会议员萨克森纳和无党无派人士切迪拉耳·萨捷。
    会议决定，进步人民联合阵线应该有一个最低的共同纲领，各组成党派可以保留并且宣传自己的纲领中的政策。
    后来，帕利华尔10月3日在勒克瑙对“政治家报”记者说，进步人民联合阵线将要邀请人民社会党和社会党根据最低的共同纲领参加进来，假如不能作到这一点，就同进步人民联合阵线协商竞选的安排，以便保证有计划地同国大党的候选人进行正面的竞争。他表示希望即将在加尔各答举行的人民社会党年会接受贾雅普拉卡希·纳拉扬所提出的关于同左翼党派就选举问题取得协议的建议。他还宣布，进步人民联合阵线的共同纲领不久就要公布。
