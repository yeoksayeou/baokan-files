    Electrified Automatic Lathe
    China's first highly electrified automatic lathe has been successfully trial-produced at the state-owned Nanjing Machine Tool Plant.

    The transmission of this new type of lathe is entirely electrically controlled. After the operator adjusts the various components and electrical equipment, he only needs to press the button, and a metal rod will be automatically sent to the positioning rod. Various tools installed on the tool holder and tool post can perform seven or eight different operations such as turning, drilling, countersinking, and cutting off in a sequential order and at different speeds. After a part is made, the lathe automatically sends it into a finished product box, and then makes the second part.

    This lathe can process bar stock of any shape and twelve different specifications of parts, making it most suitable for automobile and tractor factories. Due to the complete automation of the lathe, a third-grade worker can operate several such lathes simultaneously.

    电气化自动车床
    我国第一台高度电气化自动车床，在国营南京机床厂试制成功。
    这种新式车床传动全部是用电气操纵的。操作工人把各种机件和电气设备调整好以后，只要按动电钮，一根金属棒就会自动地送到定位杆上。装在刀架和刀排上的各种刀具，按照先后次序和不同速度，能进行车、钻、钹、切断等七、八种不同的工作。一只零件做好了，车床自动地把它送进一个成品盒子里去，接着又做第二只零件。
    这种车床可以加工任何形状的棒材和十二种不同规格的零件，最适用于汽车厂、拖拉机厂。由于车床的全部自动化，一个三级工，可以同时操纵几台这样的车床。
