In accordance with the provision of the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement that "both parties agree to hold commodity exhibitions separately in each other's countries," the Japanese Commodity Exhibition organized by the Japan International Trade Promotion Association opens in Beijing today. We express our warm welcome to the holding of this exhibition.

The mutual holding of commodity exhibitions between China and Japan reflects the common aspirations of the two peoples to expand Sino-Japanese trade and promote friendly relations between the two countries. The Chinese Commodity Exhibition held in Japan last year by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, with the support of people from all walks of life and the broad masses of the Japanese people, achieved great success. It enabled the broad masses of the Japanese people to have a better understanding of the achievements of New China's economic construction over the past few years and the broad prospects of Sino-Japanese trade. It played an active role in promoting trade relations between the two countries and strengthening the friendship between the two peoples. Similarly, the Japanese Commodity Exhibition held in China this time will also inevitably receive broad support from our government and people. Japan is our neighbor, and its industry has a long history. Its technological level is also more advanced than ours in many areas. The Chinese people, who are working hard to carry out economic construction, hope to see the latest achievements of the Japanese people in industrial production and learn from the advanced technologies and experiences of our neighbors through this Japanese Commodity Exhibition, so as to better build our country.

From the perspective of historical and geographical conditions, it is very necessary for China and Japan to develop equal and mutually beneficial trade relations and exchange what each has for what it needs. China is undertaking large-scale economic construction, and many hardware, steel, large-scale machinery, vehicles, chemical raw materials, and some daily necessities produced in Japan are what we need. With the continuous development of China's economic construction and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, this need will continue to expand and increase. On the other hand, various mineral sands, coal, salt, soybeans, rice, cashmere, various leather hides, and many other important industrial raw materials and products produced in China are also needed in large quantities by Japanese industry and people's lives. Our supply capacity of these products will also inevitably gradually increase with the development of our production. Therefore, it can be seen that Sino-Japanese trade has extremely broad prospects. We firmly believe that based on equality, mutual benefit, and friendly cooperation, the exchange of what each has for what it needs and the development of Sino-Japanese trade will benefit the economic development and people's lives of both countries.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government has declared its willingness to develop trade with governments and peoples of all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Especially for Japan, the leaders of our government have expressed to visiting Japanese representatives more than once that China hopes to develop normal trade relations with Japan. Today, China and Japan should establish friendly and peaceful relations, including equal and mutually beneficial trade relations, to meet the common requirements and aspirations of the two peoples. In the past few years, thanks to the positive attitude of the Chinese government and people towards Sino-Japanese trade, as well as the efforts of Japanese business circles and the broad masses of the people, there has been great progress in trade between the two countries. The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade has successively signed three Sino-Japanese trade agreements with the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, the Japanese Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade, and other organizations. The trade volume between China and Japan has increased year by year. An increasing number of various delegations and representatives of industrial and commercial enterprises have come to China from Japan to visit and discuss trade. They have all been welcomed by relevant organizations and foreign trade agencies in our country, and many transactions have been concluded. Japanese ships transporting goods to and from our ports have also been increasing with the development of trade between the two countries. This shows that through the continuous efforts of the two peoples, Sino-Japanese trade has achieved considerable success on a new basis.

However, it is regrettable that the trade relations between the two countries are still in an abnormal state. Under pressure from the United States, the Japanese government has implemented a so-called "embargo" policy against our country, so that many industrial products that China is willing to buy from Japan and that Japan can supply cannot be freely exported to our country. In terms of trade methods, the Japanese government has specifically adopted a strict "item-by-item barter" method for Sino-Japanese trade, which has caused great inconvenience to both parties in transactions. At the same time, the specific measures for normalizing trade between the two countries stipulated in the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, such as the suggestion that the two governments sign trade and payment agreements and establish commercial representative offices in each other's countries, have not yet been realized. These artificial obstacles formed on the Japanese side have restricted the normal development of trade between the two countries, which is not in line with the wishes and requirements of the two peoples, and it is also unfavorable to Japan's economic situation. As everyone knows, Japanese industrial production relies heavily on the import of many raw materials and the export of a large number of finished products. The result of the Japanese government's implementation of the "embargo" policy against China is only to artificially reduce the export market to China, while having to buy industrial raw materials from the United States and other places at high prices. This inevitably causes considerable losses to the Japanese economy and creates more difficulties for Japan's economic development.

Recently, people from all walks of life in Japan and an increasing number of business people have eagerly demanded to change this unreasonable state. Some responsible officials of the Japanese government have also expressed their intention to actively strive to lift the "embargo" and promote the expansion of Sino-Japanese trade. We fully support this reasonable demand of the Japanese people and welcome the positive expressions made by the Japanese government. The Chinese people are willing to see the artificial obstacles on the road of Sino-Japanese trade removed as soon as possible, the various provisions of the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement gradually implemented, and Sino-Japanese trade relations develop normally.

We believe that this Japanese Commodity Exhibition will further enhance mutual understanding between our two countries, promote the expansion of trade and technological exchanges between the two countries, and thus promote the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese peoples. We wish the exhibition success.

### 欢迎日本商品展览会在北京开幕

    欢迎日本商品展览会在北京开幕
    根据第三次中日贸易协定“双方同意相互在对方国家单独举办商品展览会”的规定，日本国际贸易促进协会举办的日本商品展览会今天在北京开幕了。我们对这个展览会的举行，表示热烈的欢迎。
    中日两国商品展览会的相互举办，反映了两国人民对扩大中日贸易和促进两国友好关系的共同愿望。中国国际贸易促进委员会去年在日本举办的商品展览会，在日本各界人士和广大人民的支持下，取得了巨大的成功。它使日本广大人民对新中国几年来经济建设的成就，对中日贸易的广阔前途都有了更好的认识。它对于促进两国贸易关系、加强两国人民的友谊，起了积极的作用。同样，这次日本在中国举办的商品展览会，也必然会得到我国政府和人民的广泛支持。日本是我们的邻邦，它的工业有着较久的历史，技术水平有很多地方也比我国先进。正在努力进行经济建设的中国人民，希望通过这次日本商品展览会能够看到日本人民在工业生产中的最新成就，学习邻邦先进的技术和经验，以便更好地来建设我们的国家。
    中日两国从历史和地理条件来看，发展平等互利的贸易关系和互通有无，是非常必要的。我国正在进行规模巨大的经济建设，日本出产的很多五金、钢材、大型机器、车辆、化工原料和一些生活日用品，都是我们所需要的。随着我国经济建设的不断发展，人民生活水平的不断提高，这种需要还会不断地扩大和增加。另一方面，我国出产的各种矿砂、煤、盐、大豆、大米、羊绒、各种皮张等许多重要工业原料和产品，也是日本工业和人民生活所大量需要的。我国这些产品的供应能力，也必然会随着我国生产的发展而逐步提高。因此，可以看出，中日两国的贸易是有着极其广阔的前途的。我们深信，建立在平等互利和友好合作的基础上，互通有无、发展中日两国的贸易，对于两国的经济发展和人民生活都是有好处的。
    自从中华人民共和国成立以来，中国政府就宣布愿意同各国政府和人民在平等互利的基础上发展贸易。尤其是对于日本，我国政府的领导人曾不止一次地向来访的日本代表表示，中国希望同日本发展正常的贸易关系。今天，中日两国应该建立友好和平的关系，包括平等互利的贸易关系，以满足两国人民的共同要求和愿望。过去几年来，由于中国政府和人民对中日贸易采取了积极的态度，以及日本工商界人士和广大人民的努力，两国的贸易有了很大的进展。中国国际贸易促进委员会同日本国际贸易促进协会、日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟等团体先后签订了三次中日贸易协定。中日两国的贸易额逐年都有增加。从日本前来中国访问和商谈贸易的各种代表团和工商企业的代表也越来越多，他们都受到了我国各有关团体和对外贸易机关的欢迎，并且达成了很多的交易。来往我国口岸运输货物的日本船只，随着两国贸易的发展也在不断增加。这说明经过两国人民的不断努力，中日贸易在新的基础上已经取得了相当成就。
    但是，令人遗憾的是，两国的贸易关系直到现在还处在不正常状态。日本政府在美国的压力下，对我国实行了所谓“禁运”政策，以致中国愿意向日本购买而日本也能够供应的很多工业产品，日本还不能自由地向我国出口。在贸易方式上，日本政府对中日贸易特别采取了严格的“逐笔易货”办法，使双方在交易上感到极大不便。同时，第三次中日贸易协定规定的建议两国政府签订贸易和支付协定、互设商务代表机构等有关使两国贸易正常化的具体措施，至今还没有实现。这些在日本方面所形成的人为障碍，限制了两国贸易的正常发展，这是不符合两国人民的愿望和要求的，同时这对日本的经济情况来说也是不利的。大家知道，日本工业生产在很大程度上依赖很多原料的进口和大量制成品的出口，日本政府对中国执行“禁运”政策的结果，只是人为地缩小了对中国的出口市场，同时又不得不用高价向美国和其他地方购买工业原料，这样就使日本经济不能不遭受相当的损失，并为日本经济发展造成更多的困难。
    近来日本各阶层人民和越来越多的工商界人士，都急切地要求改变这种不合理的状态，某些日本政府负责官员也表示要积极争取解除“禁运”，促进中日贸易的扩大。我们完全支持日本人民这种合理的要求，并且欢迎日本官方所作的积极的表示。中国人民愿意看到中日贸易道路上的人为障碍能够早日排除，第三次中日贸易协定的各项规定能够逐步付之实现，中日贸易关系能够正常发展。
    我们相信这次日本商品展览会，将会进一步增进我们两国相互之间的了解，促进两国贸易和技术交流的扩大，从而促进中日两国人民的友好关系。我们预祝这个展览会成功。
