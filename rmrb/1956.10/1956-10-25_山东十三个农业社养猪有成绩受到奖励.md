    Thirteen Shandong Agricultural Cooperatives Rewarded for Achievements in Pig Raising
    (Our dispatch) The Shandong Provincial People's Committee recently rewarded thirteen agricultural production cooperatives that have made remarkable achievements in developing pig raising. Among them, the Linfeng Cooperative in Mengyin County, with forty-six member households, raised a total of five hundred and ninety-six pigs of all sizes by September of this year, averaging nearly thirteen pigs per household. This cooperative mainly adopted the method of self-breeding and self-raising, with private raising aided by the collective, and systematically distributed agricultural by-products from the cooperative to members for feeding pigs, and reasonably stipulated manure prices. At the same time, pig-raising households also paid attention to collecting various substitute feeds and maintaining cleanliness and disease prevention for the pigs. Therefore, the cooperative's pig-raising business developed rapidly.

    山东十三个农业社养猪有成绩受到奖励
    本报讯　山东省人民委员会，最近奖励了在发展养猪事业中有显著成绩的十三个农业生产合作社。其中蒙阴县林丰社，全社四十六户社员，到今年9月间共养大小猪五百九十六头，平均每户养猪近十三头。这个社主要采取自繁自养，私养公助的办法，有计划地将社里的农作物副产品分给社员喂猪，和合理地规定了粪价。同时，养猪户也注意采集多种代饲品和猪的清洁防疫，因此全社养猪事业发展得很快。
