    Yunnan Province, Mengzi Special District, Eight Counties Including Shiping, Dispatch Cadres to Deeply Visit High-Altitude, Barren Mountain Areas; Masses Raise Opinions and Criticisms on Work Not Based on the Characteristics of Various Ethnic Groups and Mountain Areas
    (Reported by this newspaper) Yunnan's Mengzi Special District's Shiping, Jianshui, Longwu, Pingbian, Quxi, and other eight counties dispatched more than 300 county and district cadres to deeply visit 33 townships in high-altitude, barren mountain areas. The visited included more than ten ethnic groups such as Miao, Dai, Hani, and Tu. During the visits, they listened to their requests and opinions regarding the Party and the government, and also helped the various ethnic groups in high-altitude, barren mountain areas solve various current production and living difficulties. Shiping, Jianshui, Longwu, and other counties also brought doctors, medicines, grain, and a large amount of relief funds. Shiping County brought 3,000 yuan in relief funds and treated diseases for 173 patients. Longwu County supplied 250,000 jin of grain to households in difficulty in 15 townships.
    During the in-depth visits, various ethnic groups raised many opinions and criticisms about blindly establishing large cooperatives without considering the characteristics of various ethnic groups and the dispersed living arrangements in mountain areas, not leaving hemp ponds and mountain forests for the Miao people, the uncompensated entry of orchards into the cooperatives, the low prices and price suppression for the purchase of local specialties from mountain areas, the taxation of slaughtering livestock during festivals, and the centralized operation of primary schools. At the same time, they also criticized some cadres for being afraid of hardship and unwilling to go to the mountains, as well as the coercive commandism style in their work. Many people expressed to the visiting cadres that they had many difficulties that they could not solve themselves and requested that the Party and the government show more concern for them.
    Currently, each county is studying ways to improve based on the opinions raised by the people in the mountain areas. The Mengzi Prefectural Committee will soon convene a work conference on high-altitude, barren mountain areas in order to quickly improve the leadership of work in the mountain areas.

    云南省蒙自专区石屏等八县
    抽调干部深入高寒贫瘠山区访问
    群众对不根据各民族和山区特点进行工作提出意见和批评
    本报讯　云南蒙自专区的石屏、建水、龙武、屏边、曲溪等八个县，抽调了三百多县区干部，深入高寒贫瘠山区三十三个乡进行访问。被访问的有苗、傣、哈尼、土等十多个民族，在访问中一方面听取他们对党和政府的要求和意见，一方面给高寒贫瘠山区的各族人民解决当前生产、生活中的各种困难。石屏、建水、龙武等县还带了医生、药品、粮食及大批的救济款，石屏县带了三千元的救济款，还为一百七十三个病人医治了疾病。龙武县以二十五万斤粮食供应了十五个乡的困难户。
    在深入访问中，各族人民对不根据各民族的特点和山区居住分散的情况盲目办大社，不给苗族留麻塘地和山林，果园无代价入社及收购山区土特产价格偏低、压级压价，节日宰牲畜要纳税和小学集中民办等提出不少意见和批评。同时，还批评了某些干部怕艰苦不愿上山和工作中的强迫命令作风。不少群众向登门访问的干部表示，他们有许多困难自己不能解决，要求党和政府更多地关心他们。
    现在，各县正根据山区人民提出的意见，研究改进办法。蒙自地委最近要召开高寒贫瘠山区工作会议，以便迅速改进对山区工作的领导。
