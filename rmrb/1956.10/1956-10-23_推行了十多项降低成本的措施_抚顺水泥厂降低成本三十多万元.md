Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 21st - Since the third quarter, workers at the Fushun Cement Plant, by implementing more than ten measures to reduce costs, have reversed the cost overruns of the first half of the year. In the third quarter, the entire plant not only made up for the overspent costs of more than 340,000 yuan in the first half of the year, but also reduced costs by more than 300,000 yuan compared to the plan.

In the struggle to reduce costs, the workers' extensive use of substitutes achieved good results. The kiln workers used a large amount of inferior coal and cheap natural coke to fire the kilns, saving almost all the good coal previously used for kiln firing. The batching workers also used a type of artificial gypsum to replace 90% of the good gypsum. In the third quarter of this year alone, the plant saved more than 200,000 yuan just by using substitutes.

The factory also used blast furnace slag as a raw material for cement, expanding the supply of cement raw materials and overcoming the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. Workers in the calcining workshop promoted the advanced experience of judging the fire based on the flame conditions inside the kiln, extending the operating time of the cement kiln, thus significantly improving production efficiency. The entire plant has now overproduced more than 10,000 tons of cement beyond the plan.

    推行了十多项降低成本的措施
    抚顺水泥厂降低成本三十多万元
    新华社抚顺21日电　抚顺水泥厂职工从第三季度以来，由于推行了十多项降低成本的措施，改变了上半年成本超支情况。全厂在第三季度中不但弥补了上半年超支成本三十四万多元，而且还比计划降低了三十多万元。
    在降低成本的斗争中，工人们大量采用代用品的措施获得了良好的效果。烧窑工人用大量劣质煤和廉价的天然焦烧窑，使过去烧窑用的好煤几乎全部节省下来。配料工人也用一种人造石膏代替了90％的好石膏。今年第三季度全厂光是利用代用品，就节省了二十多万元。
    这个工厂还利用高炉渣做水泥原料的配料，扩大了水泥原料的供应，克服了原料不足的困难。烧成车间工人推广了根据窑内火焰情况看火的先进经验，延长了水泥窑的运转时间，因此显著地提高了生产效率。全厂现在已经超过计划多产了一万多吨水泥。
