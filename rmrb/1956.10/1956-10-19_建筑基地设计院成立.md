    Architectural Base Design Institute Established

    Xinhua News Agency, 16th. To meet the needs of the country's construction of industrial bases, a new type of design institute - the Architectural Base Design Institute - was established in Beijing by the Ministry of Construction Engineering.

    The head of the design institute said that in order to quickly put the factory buildings and residences of industrial bases into use, it is necessary to build many factories to manufacture building components, so that the construction industry can develop in the direction of factory-based and mechanized construction. This design institute specializes in designing wood processing plants, metal structure processing plants, reinforced concrete prefabrication plants, and foamed silicate product plants. The design institute is also responsible for planning the national construction bases and designing architectural machinery repair factories.

    The Architectural Base Design Institute has now accepted commissions from the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and the Ministry of Building Materials Industry to design six construction bases and individual factories producing building components throughout the country.

    建筑基地设计院成立
    新华社16日讯　建筑工程部为适应国家建设工业基地的需要而建立的一座新型的设计院——建筑基地设计院在北京成立。
    这座设计院的负责人说，要使工业基地的厂房和住宅迅速交付使用，就需要建设许多制造房屋构件所需的厂房，使建筑业向工厂化、机械化施工方向发展。这座设计院就是专门设计木材加工厂、金属结构加工厂、钢筋混凝土预制构件厂和泡沫矽酸盐制品厂的。设计院还担负规划全国建筑基地的任务和进行建筑机械修理工厂的设计。
    建筑基地设计院目前已经接受建筑工程部、冶金工业部、建筑材料工业部的委托，在全国设计六个建筑基地和个别生产房屋构件的工厂。
