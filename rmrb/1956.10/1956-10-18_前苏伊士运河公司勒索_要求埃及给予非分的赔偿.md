Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 17th: The former Suez Canal Company demanded on October 15 that Egypt grant the company unreasonable compensation.

The former Suez Canal Company, with its office in Paris, held a shareholders meeting at which the board of directors' report was adopted. The report insisted that Egypt's proposal to compensate shareholders based on the company's stock price on the eve of the canal's nationalization was "unjust," and demanded that compensation be calculated using the following methods: (1) "Basic compensation" must first include special compensation to make up for losses suffered due to the termination of the concession, which was not due to expire until 1968; (2) Compensation should include compensation for the company's stock, maritime equipment, buildings and other items; (3) All company property confiscated or frozen after Egypt nationalized the canal should be returned.

    前苏伊士运河公司勒索
    要求埃及给予非分的赔偿
    据新华社17日讯　巴黎消息：前苏伊士运河公司10月15日要求埃及给予公司以非分的赔偿。
    这个办事处设在巴黎的前苏伊士运河公司召开了股东大会，会上通过了董事会的报告。这个报告硬说埃及提出的根据运河公司国有化前夕这个公司的股票价格赔偿股东的建议是“不公正”的，而要求用以下办法计算赔偿：（一）“基本赔偿”首先必须包括一笔特别赔偿，以弥补因为到1968年才满期的使用权的中止而受的损失；（二）应包括对公司股票、水上设备、建筑物和其他项目的赔偿；（三）在埃及把运河收归国有以后被没收或冻结的公司所有物应当交还。
