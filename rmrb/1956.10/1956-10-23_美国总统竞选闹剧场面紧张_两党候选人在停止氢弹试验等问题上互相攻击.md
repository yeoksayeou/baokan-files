Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd: The United States presidential election, now entering its "final battle" stage, has become even more noisy in recent days. The two parties' mutual attacks are mainly focused on the issues of stopping hydrogen bomb tests and ending conscription. In view of the fact that Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson has put forward this slogan to cater to the psychology of voters in order to win votes, the Republican Party is mobilizing all its forces to fight back against Stevenson. Republican vice-presidential candidate Nixon, in a speech in Buffalo, accused Stevenson of "playing dangerous political tricks," saying that realizing this slogan would endanger the "security" of the United States.

Republican presidential candidate Eisenhower also criticized Stevenson's proposal in a campaign speech in Portland, Oregon, on October 18, and heavily promoted the "policy of strength." He said, "I have not promised you, nor will I promise you, that the way to defend peace and freedom lies in... abandoning our compulsory military service and the testing of our most advanced weapons." Eisenhower said, "The hope of the world depends on strength."

Eisenhower also attacked Stevenson's suggestion to end conscription as a "fence-sitting" tactic.

Under the Republican's "counterattack," Stevenson, on the one hand, continued to promote his above-mentioned slogan, saying that "stopping hydrogen bomb tests is already the wish of the Pope, many religions around the world, science, military, peace and civilian leaders." At the same time, he also gave an explanation of his slogan to stop conscription. Stevenson said that his suggestion regarding stopping conscription "has been deliberately distorted by the Republicans," and his main plan would ultimately strengthen the military strength of the United States. He said: "The problem is simply that we increasingly need experienced and professional military personnel now, and the current conscription system cannot provide us with such personnel." Stevenson rebuked the Republican's attitude as failing to "reassure those abroad who still hope that the United States will take some lead in breaking the current stalemate in the arms race."

The mutual attacks between the two parties on other issues are also very fierce. Democratic vice-presidential candidate Kefauver said that the primary issue in the current campaign is "peace." He accused Dulles of having "ignited several small wars."

In terms of domestic policy, the Democrats continue to accuse the Republican government of representing the "unilateral interests" of big capitalists, while the Republicans accuse the Democrats of this statement as being "one-sided." Eisenhower recently said in a speech that during the Republican administration, the cost of living has risen by 3%, while during the Truman administration, it has risen by nearly 5%.

    美国总统竞选闹剧场面紧张
    两党候选人在停止氢弹试验等问题上互相攻击
    据新华社22日讯　正在进入“决战”阶段的美国总统竞选，这几天已经吵得更加热闹。两党的互相攻击主要是围绕着停止氢弹试验和停止征兵的问题在进行。鉴于民主党总统候选人史蒂文森提出了这个口号来迎合选民心理以争取选票，共和党正在动员全部力量来对史蒂文森回击。共和党副总统候选人尼克松在布法罗城发表的一篇演说里指责史蒂文森这一作法是“玩弄危险的政治手腕”，实现这一口号将会危及美国的“安全”。
    共和党总统候选人艾森豪威尔10月18日在俄勒冈州波特兰城发表竞选演说时也抨击史蒂文森的建议，并且为“实力政策”大事宣传。他说，“我没有向你们保证，也不打算向你们保证说，保卫和平和自由的方法在于……放弃我们的义务兵役制和我们最先进的武器的试验。”艾森豪威尔说，“全世界的希望都取决于实力。”
    艾森豪威尔还攻击史蒂文森停止征兵的建议是一种“骑墙派”手段。
    在共和党人“反击”下，史蒂文森一方面继续宣扬他的上述口号，说“停止试验氢弹已经是教皇、全世界许多宗教、科学、军事和平民领袖的愿望”。同时，他也对他的停止征兵的口号作了一番解释。史蒂文森说，他的关于停止征兵的建议“被共和党人故意曲解了”，他的主要计划最后将会加强美国的军事力量。他说：“问题只是，现在我们越来越需要一种有经验的专业性的军事人员，而目前的征兵制度不能使我们得到这种人。”史蒂文森斥责共和党人的态度是不能“使国外那些仍然希望美国在摆脱目前军备竞赛的僵局方面起一些带头作用的人安心的”。
    两党在其他问题上的相互攻击也非常猛烈。民主党副总统候选人克弗维尔说，目前竞选运动中首要的问题是“和平”。他指责杜勒斯“点燃过几处小型战火”。
    在国内政策方面，民主党人继续指责共和党政府代表大资本家的“单方面的利益”，而共和党人则斥责民主党的这种说法是“片面的”。艾森豪威尔最近在一次演说里说，在共和党执政期间，生活费用上涨了3％，而在杜鲁门政府时期，却差不多上涨了5％。
