Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 30th. The First Automobile Works' state-assigned task of producing 300 vehicles in the third quarter was overfulfilled ahead of schedule on the 27th, exceeding the state target by 13 vehicles.

　　The small-scale assembly line production before the First Automobile Works officially started production allowed the factory's employees to gradually become familiar with the operations of organizing automobile assembly line production. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the factory director and the general production dispatching office have initially learned to organize all workshops and functional departments throughout the factory in a unified pace according to the automobile assembly instruction chart and the parts input instruction chart, so as to coordinate all aspects and conduct production rhythmically. In order to realize mass assembly line production, operation plans, scheduling systems, and various inspection systems in production management have also been established during this production run.

　　Through this stage of assembly line production training, the concept of various departments serving production has also been strengthened. Because various functional departments and workshops can often solve problems around the needs of assembly line production, the technical problems that occurred in the final assembly workshop have been reduced from 90 in July to only a few; the consumption of tools and materials in various machining workshops has also gradually approached the normal quota. These achievements have enabled the entire factory to possess the conditions for rhythmic assembly line production.

    第一汽车厂制出三百多辆汽车
    新华社长春30日电　国家规定第一汽车制造厂在第三季度出产三百辆汽车的任务，已经在27日提前超额完成了；比国家规定多出产了十三辆。
    第一汽车厂正式开工生产以前的小规模流水生产，使全厂职工逐渐地熟悉了组织汽车流水生产的业务。厂长和生产总调度室在苏联专家指导下，已经初步学会根据汽车总装配指示图表和另件投入指示图表，把全厂各车间和各职能部门按照统一的步调组织起来，做到各方面协调、有节奏地进行生产。为了实现大量的流水生产，生产管理方面的作业计划、调度制度，以及各种检验制度，也都在这次生产中建立了起来。
    通过这一阶段流水生产的训练，还加强了各个部门为生产服务的观念。由于各个职能处和各车间，都能经常围绕流水生产的需要去解决问题，总装配车间所出现的技术问题，已经由七月份的九十件减少到只有几件了；各机械加工车间的工具和材料消耗，也逐渐接近了正常定额。这些成就，使全厂已经具备了有节奏的流水生产的条件。
