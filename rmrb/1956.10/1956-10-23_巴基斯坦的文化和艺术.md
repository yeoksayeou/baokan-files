    The Culture and Art of Pakistan
    Chang Renxia

    Pakistan is a newly established country after World War II, but its cultural history is long. The word Pakistan means the Land of the Pure, and 86% of its national residents believe in Islam. Therefore, its cultural history can be traced back to the era when Islam was introduced to India. Ancient Arab, Persian, and Turkish cultures have greatly influenced the culture of Pakistan.

    Islam was introduced to North India in the 11th century. The Islamic culture and art cultivated in the nearly one thousand years since then is the cultural tradition of today's Pakistan. Historically, many Islamic scholars have made outstanding achievements in mathematics, astronomy, history, literature, and medicine. Especially in architecture, sculpture, and painting, it has its own unique style.

    Islamic art is one of the three major schools of Eastern art, standing alongside Chinese and Indian art. Architecture is an important part of Islamic art. Islamic architecture originated from folk-built dome-shaped huts and gradually developed into the characteristics of its architectural form. Many great mosques and tombs are mostly built of stone, with domes on top and squares below, and the corners of the roofs are often decorated with towering light towers, called "Manara" in Arabic, which means light. The common form of the light tower is thin and tall, with a spire on top. The tower body also has a variety of decorations. Islamic art sculptures are mostly attached to architectural art. Since Islam does not emphasize idols, there are no idol sculptures in the chapels, but the walls of the chapels are often decorated with delicate patterns, and some are inlaid with various gemstones, making them a spectacle of world architecture.

    The famous buildings of the Indian Islamic dynasty include the Qutb Minar, completed in 1300, as the earliest. Its stone was used by dismantling the buildings of Hindu temples, and the original carved patterns are still preserved on the stone walls. Secondly, the tomb of Ibrahim Adil Shah II, built in Bijapur in the 16th century, and the mosque built by the Afghan Sher Shah in Delhi in 1541 can be regarded as representatives of early Islamic architecture. The mausoleum of Jahangir, completed in 1627, is decorated with beautiful patterns both inside and outside and inlaid with gems, is a masterpiece of Islamic architectural art. But in Islamic architectural art, the most precious should be the Taj Mahal in Agra. This building is made entirely of white marble, and the decorative patterns on the walls are inlaid with various gemstones. This was built by Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved concubine Mumtaz Mahal. Construction began in 1630 and was completed in 1648, requiring 20,000 workers every day. The huge amount of manpower required can be imagined. It has become one of the five major buildings in India and is also an incomparable masterpiece in Islamic architectural art.

    Islamic culture has one thing in common with Chinese culture, that is, the love of calligraphy. Calligraphy has become a kind of traditional Islamic art, and it is often used to make beautiful patterns to decorate buildings and general objects. Ancient Arabic handwritten books are decorated with beautiful text patterns and brightly colored illustrations.

    Painting in Islamic art is also unique. Its artistic form is passed down from the Persian "miniature painting". After arriving in India, it combined with Indian art and developed a very beautiful brilliance during the Mughal Dynasty. Persian painting style was greatly influenced by Chinese painting style in the Middle Ages, using fine lines to outline the contours of objects, and then using bright and diverse colors to set the colors appropriately, and using gold and silver foil and gold mud to make the picture more splendid and magnificent. This technique of using gold and turquoise had a high degree of development in the Tang Dynasty, was transmitted westward to Persia, and then to India. This tradition is still maintained in the paintings of the Mughal Dynasty.

    The painting of the Mughal Dynasty, although developed in India, is significantly different from the ancient Indian murals. Taking the ancient Indian murals of Ajanta as an example, the content it depicts mainly focuses on the life and legends of the Buddha, and the artist made it for the purpose of worshiping the Buddha. However, in the paintings of the Mughal Dynasty, most of what is shown is the life of the court, the hunting and banquets of the nobles. The artist turned from religious themes to noble themes, and among them, there are more portraits of the ruling kings and concubines. After the Mughal Dynasty painting school, it continued to develop, and the Rajput painting school, the Kangra painting school, etc. have emerged, but basically it is still the style of "miniature painting".

    In Islamic art, arts and crafts are also quite famous. Gold work, pottery, jade work, stone work, woodwork, dyeing, weaving, embroidery, and carpets all have their own characteristics. Its artistic patterns and styles are mainly transmitted from the northwest. Inlaying patterns with gold and silver on bronzes, decorating jade sword handles and other jade utensils with patterns of gemstones and gold threads, and carving various delicate patterns on wooden small objects, all of which have their common styles in Islamic arts and crafts. Delicate and symmetrical beauty is its basic rule. Islamic artists carefully decorate the manufactured products of various materials with slender patterns, which has become their traditional artistic technique. This traditional form is still preserved on today's Pakistani handicrafts. Their ancient cultural traditions are loved by their people and have also won the praise of art lovers around the world.

    During the years when Pakistan's architecture and painting were under the rule of European colonialists, some European art elements have been introduced, which has slightly changed its traditional form. Some new buildings have adopted European styles, and new paintings no longer adhere to the style of the Mughal Dynasty. The fine lines in painting are still in use, but new breath has been blown into the composition. Taking the works of Pakistani modern painter Chughtai as an example, his "Laila in the Wilderness" uses fine lines to depict Laila leading three lambs in the wilderness, and several palm trees and Islamic buildings are faintly visible on the distant horizon. This kind of divine taste cannot be appreciated by the court painters of the past. Another picture, "King and Saint", is also fresh and vivid in composition, expressing the inner world of two people. In his picture "College Girl", the method of using lines is still the original one in Islamic art, but it has obviously absorbed the painting style of modern Europe. Secondly, the works of Faiz Rahman are also like this. He learned the traditional techniques of ancient Islamic art and also absorbed the techniques of modern European art. As for the works of Chanur Abedin, Alla Buksh, and Sheikh Ahmed, several well-known Pakistani painters, they gradually removed the rules of traditional art and pursued new techniques to the West. The European art components contained are more than the traditional Islamic art components.

    Since Pakistan got rid of the rule of Western colonialists and established an independent country, its culture and art are constantly developing, and the future creation and progress are infinitely bright.

    The friendly relations between the Chinese and Pakistani people have a long history. Today, Pakistan and our country have also established friendly diplomatic relations. We believe that the cultural exchanges between the two peoples will deepen day by day, and the friendship between the two peoples will strengthen day by day. (Attached pictures)

    巴基斯坦的文化和艺术
    常任侠
    巴基斯坦是在第二次世界大战后新建立的国家，但是它的文化历史是悠久的。巴基斯坦这个字是清真国的意思，全国居民有86％信奉伊斯兰教，因此它的文化历史，可以上溯到伊斯兰教传入印度的年代。古代阿拉伯文化、波斯文化与土耳其文化对巴基斯坦的文化都有很大影响。
    伊斯兰教传入北印度，始于十一世纪。在这以后将近一千年的长时期内所培养的伊斯兰教的文化与艺术，也就是今天巴基斯坦的文化传统，在历史上有不少伊斯兰教学者，在数学、天文学、历史学、文学、医学等方面，创造了卓越的成绩。特别是在建筑、雕刻与绘画方面，有它自己独创的风格。
    伊斯兰教艺术是东方三大艺术流派之一，与中国和印度的艺术，鼎足而立。建筑术是伊斯兰教艺术的重要部分。伊斯兰教建筑，起源于民间所造的圆顶小屋，逐渐发展，成为它的建筑形式的特点。有不少伟大的清真寺与陵墓，多用石材建造，顶作穹窿形，下作方形，屋角又常配以高耸的光塔，阿拉伯语叫做“马拿拉”，也就是光的意思。光塔的普通形式，细而且高，上有尖顶。塔身也有多种多样的装饰。伊斯兰教艺术的雕刻，多附丽在建筑艺术上。由于伊斯兰教不重偶像，所以在礼拜堂中，没有偶像的雕刻，但是在礼拜堂的壁面，常常装饰着精细的图案，并且有用各色宝石镶嵌的，成为世界建筑的奇观。
    印度伊斯兰教王朝的著名建筑，以1300年落成的古铎布丹寺为最早，它的石材是把印度教寺院的建筑拆来建造的，在石壁上还存有原来的雕刻图案。其次当十六世纪时，在比甲坡尔所建的伊布拉罕·阿德尔霞第二世的陵墓，以及阿富汗人谢尔霞于1541年在德里所建立的清真寺，都可作为前期伊斯兰教建筑的代表。在1627年建成的甲汗季的陵殿，外部和内部都装饰着美丽的图案，用宝石嵌成，是伊斯兰教建筑艺术中的杰作。但在伊斯兰教建筑艺术中，最为珍贵的，还应推亚格拉的泰吉·玛哈尔陵殿。这个建筑纯用白色大理石造成，墙壁的装饰图案，用各色的宝石嵌成。这是沙日汗为了纪念他的爱妃孟妲子·玛哈尔所造的。建筑开始于1630年，落成于1648年，每日需工二万人，所费人力之巨，可以想见。它成为印度五大建筑之一，也便是伊斯兰教建筑艺术中无可相比的杰作。
    伊斯兰教文化有一点与中国文化相同，就是对于书法的爱好，书法成为伊斯兰教传统艺术的一种，常常把文字做成美丽的图案，装饰在建筑物上，也装饰在一般器物上。古代阿拉伯文的写本书籍，有不少装饰着美丽的文字图案和彩色鲜艳的插图。
    伊斯兰教艺术中的绘画，也是独具特色的。它的艺术形式，是从波斯的“小型画”传习而来。到印度后，与印度的艺术相结合，到莫卧儿王朝，发挥了很美丽的光彩。波斯画风，在中古时代，曾受过中国画风的重大影响，用精细的线条，勾出物象的轮廓，然后用鲜艳而多样的颜料，适当地去设色，并且使用金银箔和金泥，使画面装饰得更加辉煌典丽。这种使用金碧的技术，在唐朝曾有过高度的发展，西传而入波斯，再传而入印度，在莫卧儿王朝的绘画中，还保持着这个传统。
    莫卧儿王朝的绘画，它虽然发展于印度，却与古代印度的壁画有显著的不同。以阿旃陀的古印度壁画为例，它所描绘的内容，主要的是佛陀的生活和传说，艺术家是为了崇拜佛而制作的。但在莫卧儿王朝的绘画中，所表现的多是宫廷的生活，贵族的游猎与宴乐，艺术家从宗教的题材转向贵族的题材，其中更多的是统治诸王和嫔妃的肖像。在莫卧儿王朝画派之后，继续有所发展，曾有拉吉普坦画派、康可拉画派等产生，但基本上还是“小型画”的风格。
    在伊斯兰教艺术中，工艺美术也是颇为有名的。金工、陶磁工、玉工、石工、木工、染织、刺绣与地毯等，都有其自己的特色。它的艺术的图样与作风，主要的也还是从西北方传来。在铜器上用金银镶嵌成图案，在玉的剑把及其他玉制器皿上饰以宝石和金线的图案，在木制的小器物上雕出各种细致的图案，这在伊斯兰教工艺美术中，都有其共同的风格。细致而对称的美，是其基本的法则。伊斯兰教艺术家仔细地把各种物质的制成品，都用纤细的图案装饰着，已经成为他们传统的艺术手法。这种传统的形式，在今天巴基斯坦的工艺品上，也还继续保存着。他们古老的文化传统，受到他们人民的喜爱，也博得世界的美术爱好者的赞扬。
    巴基斯坦的建筑与绘画艺术，在过去欧洲殖民者统治的年代里，已经传进一些欧洲艺术的成分，使它的传统形式略有改变。新的建筑有的采取了欧洲式样，新的绘画也不再固守莫卧儿王朝的风格。在绘画上那种纤细的线条，是依然使用着的，但构图上已经吹入新的气息。试以巴基斯坦现代画家乔太的作品为例，他的“荒野中的丽拉”一幅，用细线白描，画的是丽拉在荒野上牵着三支羊子，遥远的地平线上，隐现出几棵棕梠和伊斯兰教的建筑，这种神味不是过去的宫廷画家所能体会的。另一幅“王与圣者”这种构图也是新鲜而生动的，表达出两个人内心的世界。在他的“学院女生”一图中，使用线条的方法，虽然还是伊斯兰教艺术中所原有的，但已显然吸取了现代欧洲的画风。其次，费兹·拉哈明的作品也是如此，他学习了古代伊斯兰教艺术传统的技巧，也吸收了现代欧洲艺术的手法。至于查努尔·阿伯丁、阿拉·布哈、习克·阿默德等几位巴基斯坦的知名画家的作品，则渐渐地脱去了传统艺术的法则，向西方追求新的技巧，所含的欧洲艺术的成分，就更多于伊斯兰教传统的艺术成分了。
    巴基斯坦自从摆脱西方殖民者的统治，独立建国，它的文化与艺术，正在不断发展，将来的创造进步，是无限光明的。
    中国和巴基斯坦两国人民的友好关系是有着悠久历史的。今天巴基斯坦和我国，又建立了亲善的邦交。我们相信，两国人民之间的文化交流将一天一天加深，两国人民之间的友谊将一天一天加强。（附图片）
