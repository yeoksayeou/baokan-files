Talking about the Contradiction Between the Proletariat and the Bourgeoisie from the Essence of "Fixed Interest"
    Qian Jiaju

    Recently, some newspapers and periodicals across the country have launched discussions on the nature of the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, as well as debates on whether fixed interest is surplus value. These debates are beneficial because they can improve our Marxist-Leninist ideological level, and at the same time, they are conducive to our work of educating and transforming bourgeois elements. Since the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China were published, I believe that this debate has been basically resolved. Here, I would like to offer some personal insights for everyone's reference.

    First, I would like to start with the question of whether fixed interest is surplus value.

    Fixed interest began to be implemented after the overall public-private partnership. Although some individual public-private joint ventures had adopted the method of fixed interest before the overall joint venture, these were only individual examples. Only after the overall public-private joint venture did we adopt "fixed interest" uniformly for all joint ventures with asset appraisal and stock determination. The interest rate was originally set at one to six percent, but later changed to a uniform annual interest rate of five percent (individual enterprises can exceed five percent). During the period when the profit distribution of public-private joint ventures adopted the "four-horse split," the "one horse" that capitalists received in the "four-horse split" was clearly surplus value. When the enterprise's profits were high, the capitalists would receive more, and when the profits were low, they would receive less. When there were no profits or losses, they would not receive any. The enterprise's profits are the value created by the working class, and the portion distributed to the capitalists is surplus value obtained by the capitalists without labor. There is no doubt about this. However, after the overall public-private joint venture, the enterprise paid a uniform annual interest rate of five percent regardless of industry, size, region, or profit and loss. Thus, the problem arose: First, since the capitalists' ownership of the means of production only remains an empty shell of the right to obtain fixed interest after the overall joint venture, and the capitalists and the means of production are actually separated, the capitalists no longer control the enterprise, and the means of production are no longer capital, how can surplus value still be produced? Secondly, some joint ventures may not have any profit or even suffer losses, but the state uniformly pays a dividend of five percent. If fixed interest is said to be surplus value, then it is equivalent to saying that this surplus value is a tree without roots and water without a source. Thirdly, if fixed interest is said to be surplus value, then it must be assumed that the capitalists' means of production are still capital, and labor is still a commodity that can be bought and sold. However, the actual situation is obviously not the case. After the overall joint venture, the means of production are controlled by the state, and they cannot be used as capital to exploit workers, and labor is not a commodity that can be freely bought and sold, so how can surplus value still be produced? Fourthly, surplus value is an economic category of capitalist relations of production. However, after the industry joint venture, the relations of production have undergone fundamental changes. This kind of joint venture has basically become socialist in nature. How can the capitalist category of surplus value still be produced in socialist relations of production? Fifthly, fixed interest is unearned income, but unearned income is not necessarily surplus value. For example, land rent in feudal society is also unearned income, but it is not surplus value; in our society, the relief money issued by the government is also unearned income for the recipients, but it is not surplus value; interest on bank deposits and public bonds is also unearned income, but they are not surplus value. Only under capitalist production conditions can the capitalists' exploitation of the working class be called surplus value. The fixed interest we pay to capitalists is a kind of redemption for the bourgeoisie under China's special conditions. This is a new thing, something that is fundamentally impossible in capitalist society. Why must we rigidly apply the economic category of surplus value, which is unique to capitalist relations of production! Sixthly, some people even believe that fixed interest is not exploitation income at all, but only a part of the state accumulation divided by the working class state to redeem the bourgeoisie. As some people say: The relations of production in joint ventures "are basically the relationship between workers and the state led by the working class, a relationship of cooperation and mutual assistance, not a relationship of exploitation and being exploited... The capitalist's part of the equity and the dividends he receives are not the profits transformed from the surplus value created by exploiting the surplus labor of the working class, but a part of the state accumulation created by the working class that is paid by the state led by the working class." (See "Economic Research," No. 2, 1955, page 17, Yang Yingjie's article).

    The above are the main reasons why some people oppose regarding fixed interest as surplus value. It seems that each view is "based on reason and makes sense" in itself. However, we should grasp the most essential and fundamental things when observing and analyzing problems, and oppose using secondary and non-essential things as a method to solve problems. What is surplus value? Surplus value is the part of the value created by the working class that is occupied by the capitalists without compensation. It should be admitted that after the overall public-private partnership, the fixed interest obtained by the capitalists is a kind of unearned income, that is, a kind of exploitation income. This kind of unearned income is different in nature from the capitalists' wage income in the enterprise, and it is also different from our care for the capitalists' lives. Strictly speaking, the capitalists' wages are not truly paid according to work in the current situation. Many people's wages are higher than the wages of state cadres in the same position in joint ventures. This part of the excessive wages can also be said to be a kind of "redemption." At the same time, the state also provides some care for some old, infirm, and financially struggling capitalists. Both of these are the state's care for the capitalists' lives, and therefore contain the nature of "redemption." However, fixed interest is different from this. Fixed interest does not ask about the specific circumstances of the capitalists' lives, and pays a fixed interest rate based on the capital stock determined by the private sector during the joint venture. What qualifications do capitalists have to receive this fixed interest? They receive fixed interest based on the capital stock verified in the joint venture, that is, based on their capitalist qualifications in the joint venture. Even if an individual enterprise is merged, relocated, or even the machine is abandoned as a result of economic restructuring or production restructuring after the joint venture, he can still receive dividends based on his verified capital stock. This shows that the separation of capitalists from the actual connection with the means of production does not mean denying his ownership of capital, "because property ownership has not been completely abolished, so capitalists still receive a certain amount of interest for a certain period of time" (Chen Yun). Capital is a symbolic existence for him, but it is by no means an ethereal thing. The income obtained from this kind of capital is a kind of unearned income, and therefore it is also a kind of exploitation income. If this is not recognized, it is equivalent to denying that there is still a bourgeoisie in our society today, and that there is still a distinction between the working class and the bourgeoisie. The conclusion would inevitably be that our country has finally eliminated the exploiting classes, and that all our current work of educating and transforming the national bourgeoisie would become aimless and without basis. This statement is obviously inconsistent with the facts.

    Secondly, since fixed interest is a kind of exploitation income, where does this exploitation income come from? It is very obvious that it is created by the working class. Since it is created by the working class, is its nature the same as the wages paid to state organ staff by the workers, through the state budget, according to the principle of redistribution of national income? Not at all. The wage income of state organ staff is labor income, while fixed interest is not labor income; on the other hand, it is not paid from the state's accumulation. What is accumulation? It is the state's capital for expanding reproduction. This is the part of the working class's "labor for society," a kind of necessary labor; but what is used to pay fixed interest is labor for capitalists, a kind of surplus labor. Some people regard fixed interest income as "a part of the state accumulation created by the working class that is paid by the state led by the working class." This understanding not only does not understand the fundamental difference between accumulation and consumption, but also objectively confuses the surplus labor done by the working class for the capitalists with the necessary labor done by the working class for society. Everyone knows that accumulation is absolutely necessary for expanding social reproduction. Can it be that our country's working class cannot expand socialist reproduction without creating fixed interest for capitalists? Is fixed interest not a transitional method for the peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, but a permanent necessity for our country's socialist production?

    Thirdly, fixed interest is not essentially a state budget expenditure. Of course, some joint ventures have profits and some have losses, and fixed interest is paid uniformly, but as far as the entire joint venture is concerned, fixed interest is deducted from the profits of the joint venture. The state calculates the overall account, and the wool comes from the sheep. The fixed interest paid by the enterprise to the capitalists is paid from the profit income of the joint venture. Although there may be individual joint ventures that suffer losses and the capitalists still receive fixed interest income, generally speaking, the fixed interest expenditure of the entire joint venture is paid from the profit income of the entire joint venture, and the state has not taken out a penny from the budget to pay fixed interest. The view that the surplus value of loss-making enterprises is a tree without roots and water without a source is obviously untenable.

    Conversely, if it is believed that fixed interest is not surplus value, then the following erroneous conclusions will inevitably be reached in logic. Since fixed interest is not surplus value, that is to say, fixed interest is not a kind of exploitation income. This will confuse the class distinction between capitalists and the working class that still exists today, and it is equivalent to saying that the bourgeoisie no longer exists today. True, after the overall public-private partnership, the bourgeoisie, as a class, is in the process of being eliminated, but it has not been finally eliminated. Capitalists participate in enterprise work in a dual capacity in joint ventures. On the one hand, they are staff members, but at the same time they are capitalists. Precisely because of this, we need to continue to carry out the education and transformation of bourgeois elements, so that they can finally be transformed into self-reliant laborers. Denying that fixed interest is exploitation income is equivalent to denying the existence of the bourgeoisie today. Secondly, if it is believed that fixed interest is not surplus value, then it is equivalent to saying that public-private joint ventures and state-owned enterprises under the ownership of the whole people are no different, and we do not need to further transform public-private joint ventures into socialist enterprises under the ownership of the whole people. Because the essential difference between state-owned enterprises under the ownership of the whole people and public-private joint ventures, the highest form of state capitalism, lies in the existence of fixed interest in joint ventures, and workers still need to produce a part of the value that is occupied by the capitalists without compensation. Apart from this, the operation and management and production plans of joint ventures can be handled completely in accordance with state-owned enterprises. Some people say that we admit that fixed interest is exploitation income, but exploitation income is not necessarily surplus value. This statement is incorrect. True, not all exploitation income is surplus value, but the capitalist's exploitation income must be surplus value or a transformed form of surplus value. If we must say that the capitalist's unearned income is not surplus value, or deny that fixed interest is a kind of exploitation income, it has no practical significance other than confusing the class distinction between capitalists and laborers and saying that the capitalists who are being transformed have already been transformed into the working class.

    Fixed interest is surplus value, but this surplus value is different from the surplus value in capitalist countries. Here, the law of surplus value has fundamentally ceased to function, because capitalists can no longer pursue greater surplus value in joint ventures. This surplus value has been strictly fixed by the state - five percent (individual cases exceeding five percent are also fixed). This can be said to be a special form of surplus value, but it is still surplus value. Just as we say that class struggle in state capitalism is a special form of class struggle, but it is still a kind of class struggle.

    Before the implementation of fixed interest, we were consciously applying the law of surplus value (it can also be said that we were limiting the role of the law of surplus value), that is, when giving play to the enthusiasm of capitalist industry and commerce, we were using the law of surplus value, but it cannot be said that the law of surplus value still plays a role after fixed interest, because the law of surplus value refers to the law of the generation and appreciation of capitalist profits. Will surplus value exist without the law of surplus value playing a role? It will exist, because objective facts exist, so how can we deny objective facts! The view that where there is surplus value, there must be the law of surplus value, there must be the buying and selling of labor as a commodity, and there must be capitalists arbitrarily exploiting the working class with capital is a dogmatic logic. We must be realistic. We say what the facts are. Fixed interest is surplus value, so we say it is surplus value. The law of surplus value no longer plays a role, so we say it no longer plays a role. What is wrong with this? As for why there is surplus value without the law of surplus value playing a role, this is the result of our country's peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Theory reflects reality. There is no such thing in the classic works of Marx and Lenin, because in the era of Marx and Lenin, there was no such thing as overall public-private partnership and fixed interest!

    Now let's talk about the nature of the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

    Since fixed interest is surplus value occupied by capitalists without compensation, the bourgeoisie, as fixed interest income earners, is still an exploiting class. As an exploiting class, the class interests of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are fundamentally irreconcilable. This is the contradiction of antagonistic classes. It is fundamentally different in nature from the non-antagonistic contradiction between workers and peasants as laborers. This is the basic class theory of Marxism-Leninism. Denying this is equivalent to denying Marxism.

    However, due to China's special conditions, the correct implementation of the Party and the government's policy of peacefully transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and the series of work we have done on the national bourgeoisie in the past few years, this antagonistic contradiction has been basically resolved or is in the process of being eliminated. Therefore, I believe that at the current stage, it is unnecessary and has no guiding significance for our practice to still emphasize that the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat is an antagonistic contradiction. Why?

    Because the contradiction between the Chinese bourgeoisie and the proletariat has undergone fundamental changes after the overall joint venture. This antagonistic contradiction has not only been greatly weakened, but is also in the process of being eliminated. As is well known, after the overall public-private partnership, the relations of production in enterprises have undergone fundamental changes. Capitalists, in addition to obtaining fixed interest as a remnant of the exploiting class, have already stepped into the gate of socialism. The amount of exploitation income (fixed interest) is strictly limited (five percent), and the time will not be too long. Once the time is ripe, the fixed interest will be abolished, and the bourgeois elements will be transformed into self-reliant laborers in name and in fact, becoming members of the working class. Since the bourgeoisie, as a class, is in the process of being eliminated, the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat has also been basically resolved. The class is being eliminated, and the contradiction is also being eliminated. Why do we still emphasize their antagonistic contradiction? Secondly, in joint ventures, there is a struggle between socialist and capitalist positions, viewpoints, and methods. But this is a long-term process. It exists not only before the completion of socialist transformation, but also after the completion of socialist transformation. People's thinking always lags behind reality. In state-owned enterprises, capitalist business thinking and style do not sometimes emerge? But this kind of struggle belongs to the category of ideological struggle. Naturally, ideological struggle is also a reflection of class struggle, but the way to solve ideological struggle is ideological education, not others. This kind of struggle can no longer be regarded as the struggle between capitalist and socialist lines, not the struggle of "who will defeat whom" or "you die and I live." The struggle between the two lines of capitalism and socialism has in fact been resolved after the overall joint venture. Believing that there is still a struggle between capitalist and socialist positions, viewpoints, and methods in joint ventures, and therefore emphasizing the antagonistic contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, I think is also inappropriate. Thirdly, in joint ventures, capitalists no longer have the power to control the means of production, the power to manage enterprises, and the power to allocate personnel. As Comrade Chen Yun pointed out: "The power and authority of the personnel of the capitalist side in public-private joint ventures, its content is no longer the three powers before the public-private joint venture, but a kind of ordinary engineering and technical personnel and management personnel power given to them by the state. This is not the power of capitalists, but the power of public officials" (People's Daily, September 21). In fact, do we see in the current public-private joint ventures whether capitalists want to use their powers and positions in the enterprise to compete with the public side for leadership, or whether the private side is shrinking back, not daring to take responsibility, or whether the public side representatives are doing too much, forming a substitute, the private side has authority but no power, sitting on the sidelines, and therefore the initiative is not enough? In the past, it was clear that the latter situation was in the majority. Therefore, we have repeatedly emphasized the public-private partnership relationship, emphasized the fundamental changes in the relations of production in joint ventures, and wanted everyone to recognize that the management experience and technical knowledge of private personnel are the wealth of the country, not the burden of the country. Thanks to the efforts of the Party and the government, this situation has begun to reverse. From the specific situation of public-private partnership in joint ventures, what guiding significance does emphasizing that the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is still an antagonistic contradiction have! The reason why theoretical problems are important is that they can guide our practice. Otherwise, theoretical disputes can easily become conceptual games or scholarly arguments. The contradiction between our country's bourgeoisie and the proletariat has now undergone fundamental changes. This is the conclusion that the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China has already made. Since liberation, we have adopted a policy of both unity and struggle towards the bourgeoisie. Struggle is also for unity, and the purpose of unity is to win them over, educate them, and transform them from exploiters into self-reliant laborers. This policy has achieved a historically significant victory, and the fact that the majority of national bourgeois elements have joyfully accepted socialist transformation is a clear proof. As a class, the class interests of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are irreconcilable, and the peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is absolutely different from class reconciliation theory. As individuals, bourgeois elements can be transformed. In fact, the vast majority of bourgeois elements have accepted transformation and are in the process of being transformed. The transformation process of bourgeois elements is also the class elimination process of the bourgeoisie. The class is eliminated, and the class contradiction is gone. This contradiction is currently in the process of being eliminated, although it has not been finally eliminated. To finally resolve this contradiction, we still have to do a lot of work and continue to educate bourgeois elements, carry out the transformation of people while transforming enterprises, and on the one hand transform their thinking, and on the other hand make them learn to manage enterprises with socialist positions, viewpoints, and methods. Naturally, there will still be struggles in this, and it is possible that a very small number of bourgeois elements will resist transformation, but the vast majority are willing to accept socialist transformation, which is the main aspect of the problem. As for the resistance of individual stubborn elements, it is absolutely impossible to develop into an outbreak, that is, it is impossible to develop into a form of external conflict. And as long as we do our work well, more and more bourgeois elements who support socialist transformation will emerge, and fewer and fewer stubborn and backward people will emerge, until they disappear. This is the law of the development of objective things. At the current stage, if we emphasize the antagonistic contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, it will only cause the bourgeoisie to worry about us, fuel the "leftist" emotions of some working cadres in handling public-private relations, and only bring disadvantages to our work of transforming bourgeois elements.

    Naturally, this does not mean that we can relax our vigilance against the bourgeoisie, or relax our class struggle against the bourgeoisie. This kind of class struggle (including ideological struggle) exists not only after the overall joint venture, but will continue to exist even after the completion of socialist transformation and the elimination of the bourgeoisie. At the same time, in theoretical understanding, we must still admit that the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is a contradiction of antagonistic classes with irreconcilable interests, which is different from the contradiction between the working class and the peasants, which are laboring people. But this antagonistic contradiction is gradually being eliminated. The contradiction is not tending to intensify, but to be eliminated. The contradiction of antagonistic classes takes the form of non-antagonistic struggle. This is precisely the glorious victory of the Party and the government's policy of peacefully transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and it is the result of the creative application of Marxism-Leninism in our country.

    从“定息”的实质说到无产阶级同资产阶级的矛盾问题
    千家驹
    最近全国各地某些报刊上展开了关于无产阶级同资产阶级矛盾性质的讨论，以及关于定息是否剩余价值的辩论，这些论战是有益处的，因为这可以提高我们的马克思列宁主义的思想水平，同时，也有利于我们对资产阶级分子进行教育改造的工作。自从中国共产党第八次代表大会的文件发表以后，我认为这一论争已经基本上解决了。这里只想提出一些个人的体会，以供大家的参考。
    首先我想从定息是否剩余价值的问题谈起。
    定息是在全行业公私合营以后开始实行的，虽然在全行业合营以前，也已经有个别公私合营企业采取定息的办法，但那只是个别的例子，只有在全行业公私合营以后，我们对所有清产定股的合营企业，一律采取“定息”。息率原定为一厘到六厘，后来改为一律年息五厘（个别企业，也可以超过五厘）。当公私合营企业利润分配采取“四马分肥”的时期，“四马分肥”中资本家所分得的“一马”，其为剩余价值的性质是十分明显的。企业的利润多时，资本家就多分，利润少时就少分，没有利润或亏本时便不分。企业的利润是工人阶级所生产的价值，其中分给资本家的部分是资本家不劳而得的剩余价值，这是没有任何疑义的。但当全行业公私合营以后，企业是不分工商，不分行业，不分大小，不分地区，也不分盈亏，一律付给年息五厘。于是，问题就发生了：第一、既然全行业合营以后，资本家对生产资料的所有权只剩下一个取得定息权利的空壳子，资本家和生产资料实际上已脱离了关系，资本家已不复支配企业，生产资料也就不成其为资本了，那怎么还能生产剩余价值呢？其次，有的合营企业可能根本就没有利润或甚至亏本，但国家也一律发给以五厘的股息，如果说定息是剩余价值，那就等于说这种剩余价值是无本之木、无源之水。第三、如果说定息是剩余价值，那就一定要假定资本家的生产资料仍然是资本，而劳动力也依然是可以买卖的商品，但实际情况显然不是这样，全行业合营后生产资料已为国家所掌握，它已不能当作资本来剥削工人，而劳动力也不是可以自由买卖的商品，那怎么还能产生剩余价值呢？第四、剩余价值是资本主义生产关系的一个经济范畴，但是，行业合营后生产关系已起了根本的变化，这种合营企业基本上已变为社会主义性质的了，在社会主义生产关系中怎么还能产生资本主义范畴的剩余价值呢？第五、定息是不劳所得，但不劳所得不一定就是剩余价值，例如封建社会的地租也是不劳所得，但不是剩余价值；在我们社会里，政府所发给的救济金，对被救济者说也是不劳所得，但也不是剩余价值；银行存款以及公债的利息也是不劳所得，但它们都不是剩余价值。只有在资本主义生产条件下，资本家对于工人阶级的剥削所得，才能叫作剩余价值。我们付给资本家的定息，是在中国的特殊条件下对资产阶级的一种赎买，这是一种新的东西，是资本主义社会所根本不可能有的东西，我们为什么一定要把资本主义生产关系所特有的剩余阶值这个经济范畴去硬搬硬套呢！第六、更有的人认为定息根本不是剥削所得，只是工人阶级的国家为了向资产阶级赎买而从国家积累中分出来的一部分东西。如有人说：在合营企业中的生产关系“基本上是工人与工人阶级占领导地位国家的关系，是合作和互助的关系，而不是剥削和被剥削的关系……资本家的部分股权，和他所分得的股息，并不是由剥削工人阶级剩余劳动创造的剩余价值转化而来的利润，而是由工人阶级领导的国家将工人阶级创造的国家积累分出一部分来支付的”。（见经济研究，1955年第二期第十七页杨英杰文）
    以上种种是一部分人反对把定息当做剩余价值的主要理由，似乎每一种见解就它本身看来都是“持之有故，言之成理”的。但我们观察问题和分析问题，要抓住最本质的、最根本的东西，而反对把次要的、非本质性的东西作为解决问题的方法。什么是剩余价值呢？剩余价值是工人阶级所创造而被资本家所无偿占有的那部分价值。应该承认，全行业公私合营以后，资本家所取得的定息是一种不劳所得，也就是一种剥削收入。这种不劳所得和资本家在企业中的工资收入性质不同，也和我们对资本家的生活照顾有别。严格地说，资本家的工资在目前情况下也不是真正按劳取酬的，很多人的工资是高于合营企业中同级职位的国家干部的工资的，这一部分过高的工资也可以说是一种“赎买”。同时，国家对于某些年老力衰、生活困难的资本家还有些照顾，这两者都是国家对资本家的生活照顾，因而都含有“赎买”的性质。但定息是与此不同的。定息是不问资本家生活的具体情况如何，一律根据合营时私方清产定股的股金付给固定的息率。资本家凭什么资格领取这笔定息呢？凭他在合营企业中所核定的股金，也就是凭他在合营企业中的资本家资格领取定息。尽管有个别的企业在合营后，由于经济改组或生产改组的结果，他的厂或店合并了，搬迁了，甚至机器废弃不用了，但他依然可以凭他的核定股金领取股息。这就说明，资本家和生产资料脱离实际联系，并不等于否定他对资本的所有权，“因为没有完全废除财产所有权，因而资本家在一定时期内仍得到一定的利息”（陈云）。资本对于他是象征性的存在，但决不是虚无缥缈的东西。由这种资本所得到的收入是一种不劳所得，因而也是一种剥削收入。如果不承认这一点，那就等于否认我国社会目前尚有资产阶级的存在，尚有工人阶级与资产阶级的区别。其结论就必然是认为我国已经最后消灭了剥削阶级，而我国目前一切对民族资产阶级分子的教育改造工作都会变成无的放矢，没有根据的了。这种说法显然是不符合事实的。
    其次，既然定息是一种剥削收入，这种剥削收入是从那儿来的呢？十分明显，是工人阶级所创造出来的。既然是工人阶级所创造出来的，那么它的性质是否与由工人所创造出来、通过国家预算、根据国民收入再分配的原则而发给国家机关工作人员的工资相同呢？全然不同。国家机关工作人员的工资收入是劳动所得，而定息并非劳动所得；另一方面，它也不是从国家的积累部分中分出一部分来支付的。积累是什么？是国家用于扩大再生产方面的资金，这是工人阶级“为社会的劳动”部分，是一种必要劳动；但用于支付定息的是为资本家的劳动，这是一种剩余劳动。有人把定息收入视为“由工人阶级领导的国家将工人阶级创造的国家积累分出一部分来支付”，这种认识不仅不懂得积累和消费的根本区别，而且在客观上还混淆了工人阶级为资本家所做的剩余劳动和工人阶级为社会而做的必要劳动。谁也知道，积累是扩大社会再生产所绝对必需的，难道我们国家的工人阶级不为资本家创造定息就不能扩大社会主义再生产吗？难道定息不是我们对资本主义工商业和平改造的一种过渡办法而是我国社会主义生产所永远必需的吗？
    其三，定息在实质上也不是国家的预算支出。固然，合营企业中有盈有亏，而定息是一律支付的，但就整个合营企业来说，定息是由合营企业的利润中扣除的，国家是算总账的，羊毛出在羊身上，企业付给资本家的定息是由合营企业利润中缴付的。虽然可能有个别合营企业亏本而资本家仍然得到定息收入，但总的说来，整个合营企业的定息支出是由整个合营企业的利润收入中支付的，国家并没有在预算中拿出一分钱来支付定息。认为亏本企业的剩余价值是无本之木、无源之水的看法显然是站不住的。
    反之，如果认为定息不是剩余价值，那么在逻辑上就不可避免地会得到如下的错误结论。定息既然不是剩余价值，那就是说定息不是一种剥削收入，这就会混淆了目前资本家与工人阶级还存在着的阶级区别，就等于说资产阶级在今天已经不存在了。不错，在全行业合营以后，资产阶级作为一个阶级来说，正处在消灭过程之中，但并没有最后被消灭。资本家在合营企业中是以两重身份参加企业工作的，他一方面是工作人员，但同时又是一个资本家。正因为如此，我们才需要继续进行对资产阶级分子的教育改造工作，使他们最后改造成为自食其力的劳动者。否定定息是剥削收入，就等于否定今天还有资产阶级的存在。其次，如果认为定息不是剩余价值，那就等于说公私合营企业与全民所有制的国营企业已经毫无区别，我们也就不需要进一步把公私合营企业转变为全民所有制的社会主义企业了。因为全民所有制的国营企业和国家资本主义最高形式的公私合营企业之本质的区别即在于合营企业中还存在着定息，工人仍需要生产一部分价值为资本家所无偿地占有，除此之外，合营企业的经营管理，生产计划是完全可以按照国营企业办事的。有人说，我们承认定息是剥削收入，但剥削收入不一定就是剩余价值。这种说法是不对的，固然，并不是所有的剥削收入都是剩余价值，但资本家的剥削收入却一定是剩余价值或剩余价值的转化形态。如果一定要把资本家的不劳所得说成不是剩余价值，或者否定定息是一种剥削收入，除了混淆资本家和劳动者的阶级区别，把正在改造中的资本家说成已经改造成为工人阶级之外，是没有任何实际意义的。
    定息是剩余价值，但这种剩余价值和资本主义国家的剩余价值是有所不同的。在这里，剩余价值规律已经根本不起作用，因为资本家已经根本不可能在合营企业中追求更大的剩余价值。这种剩余价值已被国家严格定死了的——五厘（个别的超过五厘，也是定死了的）。这可以说是一种特殊形式的剩余价值，但它依然是剩余价值。正如我们说国家资本主义中的阶级斗争是一种特殊形式的阶级斗争，但它依然是一种阶级斗争一样。
    在定息实行以前，我们是自觉地运用剩余价值规律的（也可以说是限制剩余价值规律的作用），即在发挥资本主义工商业的积极性时，我们是利用了剩余价值规律的，但不能说在定息以后，剩余价值规律仍发生作用，因为剩余价值规律指的是资本主义利润的产生和增殖的规律。剩余价值规律不发生作用的剩余价值会不会存在呢？会存在，因为客观事实既然存在，我们怎么能够否认客观事实呢！认为既有剩余价值，就必然有剩余价值规律，就必然有劳动力作为商品而买卖，也就必然有资本家利用资本而任意剥削工人阶级，这是一种教条主义的逻辑。我们要实事求是，事实怎么样我们就说它是怎么样。定息是剩余价值，我们就说它是剩余价值，剩余价值规律已不起作用，我们就说它已不起作用，这有什么不可以呢？至于为什么会有剩余价值规律不起作用的剩余价值，这就是我国和平改造资本主义工商业所形成的结果。理论是反映现实的。在马克思列宁的经典著作中没有这一条，因为马克思列宁时代根本没有全行业公私合营和定息这回事啊！
    现在我们再来谈谈关于无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾性质问题。
    既然定息是资本家无偿占有的剩余价值，资产阶级作为定息收入者来说，还是一个剥削阶级。作为一个剥削阶级，资产阶级和无产阶级的阶级利益是根本不能调和的，这是对抗阶级的矛盾，它同工人、农民作为劳动者和劳动者之间的非对抗性的矛盾性质是根本不同的，这是马克思列宁主义基础的阶级理论。否认这一点，就等于否认马克思主义。
    但是由于中国的特殊条件，由于党和政府和平改造资本主义工商业方针的正确贯彻，由于我们这几年来对民族资产阶级做了一系列的工作，这种对抗性的矛盾已经基本上解决，或在消灭过程之中。因此我认为在目前阶段我们如果仍强调资产阶级和无产阶级的矛盾是对抗性的矛盾，这是不必要的，对我们的实践是没有指导意义的。为什么呢？
    因为中国资产阶级和无产阶级的矛盾，在全行业合营之后，已起了根本的变化，这种对抗性矛盾不仅大大削弱，而且正在消灭过程之中。如所周知，在全行业公私合营后，企业的生产关系已起了根本的变化，资本家除了取得定息作为剥削阶级的残余以外，他们的脚已经跨进了社会主义的大门。剥削收入（定息）数量是严格被限制的（五厘），时间也不会太长，一旦时机成熟，取消了定息，资产阶级分子就被改造成为名符其实的劳动者，成为工人阶级的一分子了。作为一个阶级来说，资产阶级既然在消灭过程中，资产阶级和无产阶级的矛盾也已基本上解决，阶级正在消灭，矛盾也正在消灭，为什么我们还要强调它们的对抗性矛盾呢？其次，在合营企业中，是存在有社会主义和资本主义的立场、观点、方法之间的斗争的。但这是一个长期的过程，不但在社会主义改造完成之前有，即在社会主义改造完成之后也还会有。人的思想总是落后于实际的，在国营企业中，不是也还有资本主义的经营思想作风有时要冒出来吗？但这种斗争已属于思想斗争的范畴，自然，思想斗争也是阶级斗争的一种反映，但解决思想斗争的方式是思想教育，而不是其他。这种斗争已不能认为是资本主义路线和社会主义路线的斗争，不是“谁战胜谁”“你死我活”的斗争。资本主义和社会主义两条路线的斗争，在全行业合营以后，事实上已经解决。认为在合营企业中还存在着资本主义和社会主义的立场、观点、方法的斗争，因而就强调资产阶级和无产阶级的对抗性矛盾，我认为也是不适当的。第三，在合营企业中，资本家已经没有生产资料支配权，企业经营管理权和人事调配权，正如陈云同志所指出：“公私合营企业中资方人员的有职有权，它的内容，已经不是公私合营以前的三权，而是国家给予他们的一种普通工程技术人员和管理人员的职权，这不是资本家的职权，而是公务人员的职权”（9月21日人民日报）。在事实上，我们看目前公私合营企业中，究竟是资本家想利用他在企业中的职权、地位同公方争夺领导权呢，还是私方缩手缩脚，不敢负责，或者公方代表工作上包揽过多，形成代替，私方有职无权，坐冷板凳，因而主动性积极性不够呢？就过去一个时期来说，显然是后一种情况占居多数。因此，我们才一再强调公私共事关系，强调合营企业中生产关系的根本变化，要大家认识私方人员的管理经验和技术知识是国家的财富而不是国家的包袱。由于党和政府的努力，这种情况已开始有所扭转。从合营企业中的公私共事的具体情况看，强调无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾仍然是对抗性的矛盾又有什么指导意义呢！理论问题之所以重要，在于他能指导我们的实践，不然的话，理论的争论就很容易变成概念式的游戏或学究式的论争。我国资产阶级和无产阶级的矛盾现在已起了根本性的变化，这是中国共产党第八次代表大会已经做出的结论。解放以来，我们对资产阶级采取了又团结又斗争的方针，斗争也是为了团结，而团结的目的是为了争取他们，教育他们，使他们由剥削者变成自食其力的劳动者。这一政策已取得了具有历史意义的胜利，大多数民族资产阶级分子都欢欣鼓舞地接受社会主义改造，就是事实的明证。作为阶级来说，资产阶级和无产阶级的阶级利益是不可调和的，和平改造资本主义工商业绝对不同于阶级调和论。作为个人来说，资产阶级分子是可以改造的。事实上，绝大多数资产阶级分子都接受了改造，而且正在改造过程之中，资产阶级分子的改造过程也就是资产阶级的阶级消灭过程。阶级消灭了，阶级矛盾也就没有了。目前这种矛盾正在消灭的过程中，虽然还没有最后被消灭。要使这一矛盾最后解决，我们还必须做许多工作，还需继续进行对资产阶级分子的教育，在企业改造的同时进行对人的改造，一方面改造他们的思想，一方面使他们学会以社会主义的立场、观点和方法来经营管理企业。这里面自然也还会有斗争的，也可能有个别的极少数的资产阶级分子对改造进行反抗，但绝大多数是愿意接受社会主义改造的，这是问题的主要方面。至于个别的顽固分子的反抗，是绝不可能发展成为爆发，即不可能发展成为外部冲突的形式的。而且只要我们工作做得好，拥护社会主义改造的资产阶级分子会越来越多，而顽固的落后的人会越来越少，以至于消失。这是客观事物发展的规律。在目前阶段，我们要是强调资产阶级和无产阶级的对抗性矛盾，只会引起资产阶级对我们的顾虑，助长某些工作干部在处理公私关系上的“左”倾情绪，只会对我们改造资产阶级分子工作上带来了不利。
    自然，这不是说我们可以放松对资产阶级的警惕，放松对资产阶级的阶级斗争。这种阶级斗争（包括思想斗争）不仅在全行业合营以后存在，甚至在社会主义改造完成、资产阶级消灭之后也还会继续存在。同时在理论认识上我们还必须承认无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾是利益不可调和的对抗阶级的矛盾，它不同于工人阶级和农民那种劳动人民之间的矛盾。但这一对抗性矛盾正在逐步消灭的过程之中，矛盾不是趋于尖锐化而是趋于消灭，对抗阶级的矛盾而采取非对抗斗争的形式，这正是党和政府采取和平改造资本主义工商业政策的光辉胜利，是马克思列宁主义在我国创造性的运用的结果。
