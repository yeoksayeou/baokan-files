Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 12th. According to a report by the Czechoslovak News Agency: Czechoslovakia's geological exploration work this year has increased eightfold compared to 1950, and many new mineral deposits have been discovered successively.

    So far, new coal mines have been discovered in the Pilsen hard coal basin and the North Bohemian basin. A lignite deposit has been discovered near the Vixinine-Jitzke-Seikov-Hnoine area. After this deposit is mined, its coal will be sufficient to supply eastern Slovakia's fuel needs. Coal mines suitable for building three new mines have also been discovered in the Modry Kamen area in southern Slovakia.

    Geological workers have discovered a large amount of iron ore deposits between Prague and Pilsen. By 1960, it is hoped that the number of domestic iron ore mines will increase to sixty, several of which may have an annual output of more than one million tons. That is to say, the output of just one such iron mine will be able to reach the total pre-war national iron ore production.

    Other mineral deposits discovered by geological workers include: tin, tungsten iron ore, copper, gold, lead-zinc ore, and silver ore.

    捷克斯洛伐克发现许多新矿藏
    新华社布拉格12日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道：捷克斯洛伐克今年地质勘探工作量比1950年增加了八倍，许多新矿藏相继被发现了。
    到目前为止，在比尔森硬煤盆地和北波希米亚盆地已经先后发现了新的煤矿。在维希尼内极次克—塞伊科夫—赫诺伊内地区附近发现了褐煤矿床，这个矿床开采以后，它的煤将足以供应斯洛伐克东部对燃料的需要。斯洛伐克在南部的莫德里卡门地区也发现了可供建设三个新矿场的煤矿。
    地质工作者在布拉格和比尔森之间发现了大量的铁矿藏。到1960年时，国内的铁矿有希望增加到六十个，其中有几个铁矿的年产量可以超过一百万吨，也就是说，仅仅一个这样铁矿的产量就能够达到战前全国铁矿砂的总产量。
    地质工作者所发现的其他矿藏还有：锡矿、钨铁矿、铜矿、金矿、铅锌矿和银矿等。
