Speech by Comrade Wu Zhipu, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

I fully agree with the political report made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, the report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy made by Comrade Zhou Enlai, and the report on the amendment of the Party Constitution made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping.

    Striving for Income Increases for 90 Percent of Cooperative Members is of Great Significance for Consolidating Agricultural Cooperatives

Since the Seventh National Congress of the Party, the Chinese people have experienced unprecedented major events. Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, they have completed the historical task of the bourgeois democratic revolution, and then basically completed the task of the socialist revolution. During this period, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong creatively applied the principles of Marxism-Leninism, combined with the actual situation in rural China, adopted correct class policies and appropriate methods and steps, fully utilized the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses," and boldly mobilized the broad masses of peasants to thoroughly implement land reform, further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and strengthen the social foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship, creating conditions for the peaceful transition from democratic revolution to socialist revolution; after the completion of the democratic revolution, the Party actively and steadily went through various transitional forms, gradually enlightened the peasants' socialist consciousness, and formed a high tide of socialist revolution last year. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong promptly and sharply criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking existing within the Party, which underestimated the high tide and was content with the status quo of small-scale peasant economy, and led the nation's peasants to rapidly achieve cooperation. After the realization of cooperation, the Party seized the most important and pressing demands of the peasants, put forward the great agricultural development program outline as a goal for agricultural production increase within twelve years, and in order to encourage the peasants' enthusiasm for labor, fully unleash the peasants' initiative and creativity, and ensure the smooth realization of the agricultural development program outline, in accordance with the principle of taking into account both collective and individual interests, it was proposed to strive for at least 90 percent of the cooperative members to be able to increase their income every year compared to the previous year. The universal implementation of this policy throughout the country will undoubtedly be the driving force for mobilizing more than 500 million peasants across the country to enthusiastically engage in socialist construction, and will inevitably become a new example of solving the peasant problem in the new era.

The great role of guaranteeing income increases for 90 percent of cooperative members has been proven by the actual situation in Henan Province. Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Henan Province basically realized advanced forms of agricultural cooperation by May this year. There are now 26,188 advanced agricultural production cooperatives, with peasant households joining the cooperatives accounting for 97.5 percent of the total number of peasant households. With the high tide of agricultural cooperation, a high tide of agricultural production appeared throughout the province, a mass movement to build farmland water conservancy was launched, and the irrigated area was expanded by more than 36.37 million mu. Wheat field management exceeded any previous year, the amount of fertilizer applied increased more than twofold, and the area of wheat irrigated expanded nineteenfold. Therefore, this year's summer crops, despite the serious circumstances of continuous rain and flood disasters, were still able to reach 10.6 billion jin, overfulfilling the state plan. In the summer distribution, in addition to the severely affected areas of 7,915 cooperatives where most members reduced their income, 18,273 cooperatives in non-disaster areas saw income increases for about 85 percent of their members, of which 71 percent guaranteed income increases for more than 90 percent of their members. After the summer distribution, in cooperatives that guaranteed income increases for the vast majority of their members, the members' awareness and enthusiasm for labor production greatly improved; even those upper-middle peasants who were originally skeptical about the ability of joining cooperatives to increase income and had low production morale changed their understanding and turned from passive to active. Conversely, in cooperatives where members' income decreased significantly, dissatisfaction among members was aroused, the production morale of some members was low, and disunity arose within a small number of production teams and production groups. This illustrates the great significance of striving for income increases for 90 percent of cooperative members for consolidating agricultural production cooperatives.

To Guarantee Income Increases for Cooperative Members, It is Necessary to Appropriately Resolve the Proportion Between Public Accumulation and Cooperative Members' Personal Consumption

But how can we guarantee that 90 percent of cooperative members increase their income every year? Based on a survey of nine different types of agricultural production cooperatives, we believe that in order to achieve the above objectives, it is necessary not only to properly solve the production problems of cooperatives in accordance with the laws of socialist economic development, but also to properly solve the distribution problems, that is, to appropriately solve the proportion between public accumulation for socialism and personal consumption for cooperative members.

Obviously, if a cooperative does not increase production or increases production less, it cannot guarantee income increases for cooperative members. Even if agriculture increases production, it is difficult to guarantee income increases for the vast majority of cooperative members if sideline production does not increase. For example, in Qi Spring Cooperative in Lin County of our province, agriculture production increased 40 percent in the wheat season, and sideline production and other economic crops increased 160 percent, which guaranteed income increases for all members. Conversely, in a cooperative in Xifeng Township in Lin County, agriculture production increased 24 percent, but sideline production decreased 50 percent. As a result, only 55.6 percent of the members increased their income. Farmers in our province have always been good at engaging in diversified operations, and income from sideline production and handicrafts accounts for about 40 percent of the total income from agriculture and sideline production, but we neglected the development of diversified economy in guiding agricultural production this spring, which is an important reason why 29 percent of the cooperatives in non-disaster areas did not achieve income increases for 90 percent of their members. Therefore, in the future, it is necessary to determine different policies for developing production according to different situations such as grain-producing areas, economic crop areas, mountainous areas, and urban suburbs. Some cooperatives should focus on developing agriculture and concurrently engage in diversified economy, while some cooperatives should give equal importance to agriculture and sideline production. In the production of cooperatives, in addition to thoroughly implementing the policy of diversified operations and comprehensive development, special attention should also be paid to: on the one hand, truly practicing diligence and thrift in running cooperatives, correcting the tendency of being greedy and rash in planning, and especially trying to reduce non-productive expenditures; on the other hand, in the case of a large increase in production, attention should also be paid to preventing the emergence of the idea that production has reached its peak. For example, in Hehe Cooperative in Xinxiang County and Shengli Cooperative in Yaocun in Lin County, wheat production increased 50 to 90 percent due to good management and effective technical measures. The members said: "This year's wheat is like the 'Yang Family Generals', each piece is better than the last." After the wheat harvest, some members developed the idea that "one season is good, one season is bad, and it's no use managing anymore" and had no confidence in continuing to increase production in the future. Therefore, carrying out technical reforms and guiding farmers to constantly advance on the production front in a planned way has become a fundamental issue for guaranteeing agricultural production increase in the future.

However, the decisive factor for continuously improving farmers' enthusiasm for labor, thereby continuously improving labor productivity to ensure the continuous increase in agricultural and sideline production, is the question of how to distribute the fruits of labor. Farmers were small private owners not long ago and were very concerned about individual interests. After joining the cooperatives, they generally believed in the ability to increase production, but some people were still skeptical about whether individuals could increase their income. It is necessary to enable them to truly increase their income personally before consolidating and continuously improving their enthusiasm for production. This is just as Lenin taught us: those who build socialism are necessarily the people who grew up under the capitalist system, not fictitious ideal talents. Therefore, they must be materially concerned about the construction of socialism. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his political report, "A major issue in ensuring the development of agricultural production is that farmers must be guaranteed to increase their income under the conditions of production development." After agricultural cooperation, in order to ensure that farmers receive the income they deserve, "not only does the state need to have correct tax and price policies, but also the cooperatives need to correctly stipulate the proportion of public accumulation and cooperative members' personal income." The distribution of cooperative income concentrates the relationship between the state and the cooperative, the cooperative and the members, and the members and the members. The quality of distribution has an extremely important significance for ensuring national construction, internal accumulation of the cooperative, and increasing the income of cooperative members. Therefore, it is necessary to determine a reasonable distribution ratio under the principles of "deducting less and distributing more" and guaranteeing income increases for 90 percent of cooperative members, according to the specific circumstances of each cooperative. From the results of the summer distribution of eight cooperatives, the deduction ratio of each cooperative is: 30-35 percent for five cooperatives, and 36-40 percent for three cooperatives, basically implementing the Party Central Committee's instruction that "60 to 70 percent belongs to the cooperative members personally" and the principle of "distribution according to work," but in specific analysis, there are still many problems. For example, the proportion of public grain in each cooperative is very unbalanced, with the lowest accounting for 8 percent of the total agricultural income in summer and the highest accounting for 24 percent; there are also many problems in other tax policies and the price ratio between industrial products and agricultural products; in the distribution work, some cooperatives have egalitarianism. Due to the existence of these problems, the enthusiasm of some farmers for production has been affected to a certain extent. According to the materials of nine cooperatives, the current agricultural tax policy can adopt the method of fixing the output for several years and levying taxes in proportion. The amount of collection can account for about 10 percent of the fixed agricultural output. Various deductions within the cooperative can account for about 25 percent of the total income. Among them, production costs account for about 15 percent, management costs account for 0.3 to 0.5 percent, public accumulation funds account for 3 to 5 percent, and public welfare funds account for 1 to 1.5 percent. A certain amount of savings grain can also be retained during the harvest. When conducting distribution, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of distribution according to work and guarantee more pay for more work. In addition to implementing the distribution of income in summer and autumn, some agricultural production cooperatives have already established a distribution system on a quarterly or monthly basis. In the future, each cooperative should also establish a system of paying members labor remuneration in advance on a monthly or quarterly basis according to the amount of cash income. In the distribution, special attention should be paid to the principle of equal pay for equal work between men and women, giving women the labor remuneration they deserve, in order to fully unleash the enthusiasm of the broad masses of women in participating in agricultural and sideline production, which is an aspect that cannot be ignored in the distribution.

To Unleash the Potential of Agricultural Cooperatives and the Enthusiasm of Cooperative Members, the Relationship Between Centralization and Independence Should Be Appropriately Resolved

In order to fully unleash the production potential of agricultural cooperatives and the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of cooperative members, it is also necessary to appropriately resolve the relationship between centralization and independence. The state to agricultural cooperatives and cooperatives to cooperative members must be allowed a certain degree of independence. In the past year, we have had phenomena of excessive and overly strict restrictions on cooperatives and cooperatives to cooperative members. Agricultural production cooperatives have no flexibility in the plans for agricultural production and capital construction. For example, in a cooperative in Guangwu, Xingyang County, the cotton planting area has already accounted for 60 percent of the cultivated land, and this year it has been decided to further expand the cotton planting area, squeezing out 450 mu of vegetables and sweet potatoes, affecting the income of diversified economy and the supply of non-staple food in towns. In the second cooperative of Langling Temple in Queshan County, which is an irrigation area of ​​the Bo Mountain Reservoir, they were also allowed to sink 24 wells, resulting in the waste of a lot of funds and labor. Cooperatives also managed the labor use, financial expenditures, and sideline business of production teams in a very mechanical manner, causing the production teams to rely on the management committee for everything, resulting in losses and waste in production. Cooperatives also controlled the labor time and household sideline business of cooperative members too strictly and rigidly, affecting the income of cooperative members. In practice, the production conditions and the needs of each agricultural cooperative cannot be completely consistent, and it is difficult for the state's plan to completely suit the needs of each agricultural production cooperative in all aspects, and it is also difficult for cooperatives to completely cover the production and life of production teams and cooperative members. Therefore, in the future, the state's guidance on the production plan of agricultural cooperatives should gradually adopt the method of stipulating the purchase task without stipulating the specific planting area, or it can stipulate the target for the planting area of ​​major crops, but give it a certain number of flexibility. This will facilitate the cooperatives to implement planting according to local conditions, which will also be conducive to meeting the needs of the state and the people. Cooperatives must implement contracting of agricultural and sideline production, contracting of output, and financial contracting to production teams, and production teams should also be allowed to engage in a certain amount of sideline production. Cooperatives should also give cooperative members a certain amount of time to engage in household sideline production and household labor; and cooperatives should also actively help cooperative members solve various difficulties in developing household sideline production.

Rural Party Organizations Should Highly Care About the Vital Interests of the Broad Masses of Peasants

The Party is shouldering the glorious and arduous task of building socialism. Fundamental changes in the social nature have already taken place in the vast rural areas, and our work tasks in rural areas are also in a new period of transition from social reform to technical reform. At such a critical moment, it is very necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership over rural work, highly care about the vital interests of the broad masses of peasants, strive in various aspects to ensure that more than 90 percent of the members of agricultural cooperatives can increase their income every year on the premise of continuous development of agricultural production, in accordance with the principle that laborers under the socialist system are concerned about the fruits of their labor in terms of material interests. At the same time, on the basis of gradually improving material and cultural life, greatly strengthen the Party's political and ideological work, improve the political awareness of peasants, strengthen unity within peasants, mobilize all positive factors, overcome all negative factors, fully unleash the peasants' enthusiasm for labor and creative wisdom, further consolidate the cooperatives, and further promote the upsurge of agricultural production. Doing so will be able to supply urban industry with sufficient grain, raw materials, and a broad market, more strongly support the country's industrialization, and in turn, more strongly promote the modernization of agriculture, on the basis of closer relations between urban and rural areas and a more consolidated worker-peasant alliance, complete the country's first five-year plan ahead of schedule and with greater success, and welcome the arrival of the country's second five-year plan with full confidence.

    关于增加农业生产合作社社员收入的一些问题
    中共河南省委员会书记　吴芝圃同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志所作的政治报告，周恩来同志所作的关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告和邓小平同志所作的关于修改党的章程的报告。
    争取百分之九十的社员增加收入，对于巩
                  固农业社有重大的意义
    从党的第七次全国代表大会到现在，中国人民经历着史无前例的重大事变，在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的正确领导下，完成了资产阶级民主革命的历史任务，接连着又基本上完成了社会主义革命的任务。在这个时期里，党中央和毛泽东同志创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的原理，结合中国农村的实际情况，采取正确的阶级政策与适当的方法步骤，充分地运用“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线，放手发动广大农民彻底实行了土地改革，进一步巩固了工农联盟，加强了人民民主专政政权的社会基础，为由民主革命和平转向社会主义革命创造了条件；在民主革命的任务完成以后，党又积极而稳步地经过各种过渡形式，逐步启发农民的社会主义觉悟，在去年形成了社会主义革命的高潮，党中央和毛泽东同志又及时地尖锐地批判了在党内存在的对高潮估计不足和安于小农经济现状的右倾保守思想，领导全国农民迅速地实现了合作化。在实现合作化以后，党又抓住了农民最主要最迫切的要求，提出了伟大的农业发展纲要，作为十二年内农业增产的奋斗目标，并且为了鼓舞农民的劳动热忱，充分发挥农民的积极性和创造性，保证农业发展纲要的顺利实现，又按照集体利益与个人利益兼顾的原则，提出争取至少百分之九十的社员每年能够比前一年增加收入的方针。这一方针在全国的普遍执行，毫无疑问是动员全国五亿多农民热烈地进行社会主义建设的动力，也必然成为在新时期解决农民问题的又一个新的范例。
    保证百分之九十的社员增加收入的巨大作用，已经为河南省的实际情况所证明。河南省在党中央的正确领导下，到今年五月间基本上实现了高级形式的农业合作化。现在共有高级农业生产合作社二六、一八八个，入社农户占总农户的百分之九十七点五。随着农业合作化的高潮，在全省范围内出现了农业生产的高潮，开展了群众性的兴修农田水利运动，扩大灌溉面积三、六三七万余亩。麦田管理超过以往任何一年，追肥数量增加一倍以上，浇麦面积扩大十九倍。因此，今年夏季作物，虽然在连阴雨和洪水成灾的严重情况下，但收获量仍然能够达到一○六亿斤，超额完成了国家计划。在夏季分配中，全省除重灾区的七、九一五个社大部分社员减少收入外，非灾区的一八、二七三个社有百分之八十五左右的社员增加了收入，其中有百分之七十一的社保证了百分之九十以上的社员增加了收入。经过夏季分配，凡是保证了绝大部分社员增加收入的社，社员的觉悟和劳动生产积极性都有很大提高；甚至那些原来对参加合作社能够增加收入持怀疑态度、生产情绪不高的上中农，也改变了认识，变消极为积极了。反之，社员收入减少较多的社，就引起了社员的不满，部分社员生产情绪低落，少数生产队和生产组内部闹不团结。这就可以说明争取百分之九十的社员的增加收入对于巩固农业生产合作社的重大意义。
    要保证社员增加收入，就要适当解决公
      共积累和社员个人消费的比例问题
    但是如何才能够保证百分之九十的社员每年增加收入呢？根据九个不同类型的农业生产合作社的调查，我们认为要达到上述的目的，不但要按照社会主义经济发展的法则很好地解决合作社的生产问题，而且要很好地解决分配问题，也就是要适当地解决用于社会主义的公共积累与用于社员个人消费的比例问题。
    很明显，合作社不增产或少增产，就不能够保证社员增加收入。即使农业增产了，如果副业不增产，也很难保证绝大多数社员增加收入。例如我省林县淇泉社，麦季农业增产百分之四十，经营副业和其他经济作物增产了百分之一百六十，就保证了全部社员增加了收入。相反的，林县西丰乡一社，农业增产百分之二十四，但副业减少了百分之五十。结果只有百分之五十五点六的社员增加了收入。我省农民本来就是善于进行多种经营的，副业和手工业的收入大约占农副业总收入的百分之四十左右，而我们今年春季在指导农业生产上，却忽视了多种经济的发展，这是造成非灾区有百分之二十九的社没有达到百分之九十的社员增加收入的重要原因。因此，今后必须根据粮产区、经济作物区、山区和城市郊区等不同情况，确定不同的发展生产的方针，有的社应该以发展农业为主兼营多种经济，有的社应该农业和副业并重。在社的生产上，除了应该贯彻执行多种经营，全面发展的方针外，还应该特别注意：一方面要真正做到勤俭办社，纠正在计划上贪大冒进的偏向，尤其是要尽量减少非生产的开支；另一方面，在大量增产的情况下，也要注意防止产生生产到顶的思想。例如新乡县合河社，林县姚村胜利社，由于经营管理好，采取了有效的技术措施，麦田增产百分之五十到九十，社员说：“今年小麦是‘杨家将’，一块赛一块”。在麦收后，有些社员产生了“一季好，一季坏，再管理也不行”的思想，对今后继续增产没信心。因此，进行技术改革，有步骤地引导农民在生产战线上不断地前进，就成为今后长期的保证农业增产的根本问题。
    但是，对不断地提高农民的劳动热忱，从而不断地提高劳动生产率以保证农副业不断地增产带有决定性的因素，却是对劳动果实如何分配的问题。农民在不久以前还是小私有者，非常关心个人的利益，入社后对能够增产一般是相信了，但对个人能不能增加收入还有一部分人将信将疑。必须使他们个人能够真正增加收入，然后才能够巩固和不断提高他们的生产积极性。这正如列宁教导我们的：建设社会主义的，必然是资本主义制度下成长起来的人们，而不是虚构的理想人材。因此，必须使他们从物质上来关心社会主义的建设。也正如刘少奇同志在政治报告中所说的“保证农业生产发展的一个重大问题，是必须保证农民在生产发展的条件下能够增加收入。”在农业合作化以后，为了保证农民得到应有的收入，“不但需要国家有正确的税收政策和价格政策，而且需要合作社正确地规定公共积累和社员个人收入的比例”。合作社的收益分配，集中地体现着国家与合作社、合作社与社员、社员与社员之间的关系。分配的好坏，对于保证国家建设，社内积累和增加社员收入，有着极其重要的意义。因此，必须在“少扣多分”和保证百分之九十的社员增加收入的原则下，根据各社的具体情况确定合理的分配比例。从八个社夏季分配的结果看，各社的扣除比例是：百分之三十——三十五的五个社，百分之三十六——四十的三个社，基本上执行了党中央所指示的“百分之六十至七十归社员个人所有”的方针和“按劳取酬”的原则，但是，具体分析起来，还有不少问题。如各社公粮比例很不平衡，最低的占夏季农业总收入的百分之八，最高的占百分之二十四；在其他税收政策和工业产品与农业产品的比价方面，也存在着不少的问题；在分配工作中，有些社有平均主义思想。由于这些问题的存在，使有些农民的生产积极性受到一定的影响。从九个社的材料看，现行的农业税收政策，可以采用固定几年产量，按比例征收的办法。征收数量，可占农业定产量的百分之十左右。社内各项扣除可占总收入的百分之二十五左右。其中生产费用占百分之十五左右，管理费用占百分之零点三到百分之零点五，公积金占百分之三到百分之五，公益金占百分之一——百分之一点五。丰收时还可以留一定数量的储蓄粮。在进行分配的时候，必须坚持按劳取酬的原则，保证多劳多得。有些农业生产合作社除实行夏秋两季分配收入外，已经建立了按季或按月的分配制度。今后各个合作社还应该根据现金收入多少，普遍建立给社员按月或按季预支劳动报酬的制度。在分配中，要特别重视男女同工同酬的原则，给妇女以应得的劳动报酬，以便充分地发挥广大妇女参加农业和副业生产的积极性，这是在分配中一个不可忽视的方面。
    要发挥农业社的潜力和社员的积极性，
    应该适当解决集中性和独立性的相互关
                    系问题
    为了充分发挥农业社的生产潜力和广大社员的劳动积极性，还要适当地解决集中性和独立性的相互关系的问题。国家对农业社、社对社员，必须允许有一定的独立性。过去一年，我们对社、社对社员都有限制过死过严的现象。在农业生产和基本建设的计划上，农业生产合作社没有机动权。例如荥阳县广武一社，棉花播种面积已占耕地的百分之六十，今年又确定再扩大植棉面积，挤掉了四百五十亩的蔬菜和甘薯，影响了多种经济的收入和城镇副食品的供应。确山县郎陵寺二社，是薄山水库的灌溉区，也让打井二十四眼，结果浪费了许多资金和劳力。社对生产队的劳力使用、财务开支和副业经营方面，也管得很机械，弄得生产队事事依靠管理委员会，造成生产上的损失浪费。社对社员的劳动时间和经营家庭副业也控制的过严过死，影响了社员的收入。在实际上，各个农业社的生产条件和社员的需要不可能完全一致，国家的计划很难作到完全适合每个农业生产合作社各个方面的需要，社对生产队和社员的生产和生活也很难完全包起来。因此，今后国家对农业社生产计划的指导，最好逐步做到采取规定收购任务，不规定具体种植面积的办法，也可以将主要农作物的种植面积规定指标，但给以若干机动数字。这样就便于合作社实行因地种植，也就有利于满足国家和人民的需要。社对生产队，必须实行农副业生产的包工、包产和财务包干，并且要允许生产队经营一定的副业生产。社对社员也应该给以一定时间，从事家庭副业和家务劳动；并且，社还应该积极地帮助社员解决发展家庭副业的各种困难。
  农村党组织要高度关怀广大农民的切身利益
    党正担负着建设社会主义的光荣而艰巨的任务。广大农村已经发生了社会性质的根本变化，我们在农村的工作任务也正处在由社会改革转入技术改革的新时期。在这样的紧要关头，加强党对于农村工作的领导，高度关怀广大农民的切身利益，根据社会主义制度下劳动者从物质利益上关心自己劳动果实的原则，在不断发展农业生产的前提下，积极地从各方面争取农业社百分之九十以上的社员每年都能够增加收入，同时，在逐步地改进物质生活和文化生活的基础上，大大加强党的政治思想工作，提高农民的政治觉悟，加强农民内部的团结，调动一切积极因素，克服一切消极因素，充分发挥农民的劳动热情与创造智慧，进一步巩固合作社，进一步促进农业生产的高涨，是非常必要的。这样做，便能够供给城市工业以充足的粮食、原料和广阔的市场，更加强有力地支援国家的工业化，也就会反转过来更加强有力地促进农业的现代化，在城乡关系更加密切，工农联盟更加巩固的基础上，提前和超额完成国家第一个五年计划，满怀信心地迎接国家的第二个五年计划的到来。
