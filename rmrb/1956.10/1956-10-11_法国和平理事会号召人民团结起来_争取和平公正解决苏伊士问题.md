    Xinhua News Agency, October 10th, TASS, Paris, 9th: French newspapers published a statement by the French National Peace Council on French foreign policy issues. The National Peace Council emphasized: "The French government's threat of force and its declaration of being willing to risk war on the Suez issue has isolated the country, weakened its prestige, and damaged its position in the region."
    The statement continued, "A peaceful resolution of the Suez issue must be sought, which both guarantees the freedom of navigation in the canal and respects Egyptian sovereignty. The interests of France require France to work together with all countries advocating a peaceful resolution of the Suez issue."
    The National Peace Council calls on every French person who is concerned about the future of the motherland to unite and strive for a just resolution of the Algerian issue and the Suez issue, and to oppose the arming of West Germany.
