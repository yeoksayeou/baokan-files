Xinhua News Agency Report: The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge's beam construction has begun simultaneously on both the Hankou and Wuchang sides of the river.

On the right bank construction site, on the morning of the 12th, a 24-ton steel beam stringer was safely placed on the pier cap of Pier No. 9. Before construction began on the right bank, the bridge builders made thorough preparations. At the end of August, engineers used pictures, charts, and models to explain the technical issues to be noted in the beam construction process in detail to the workers, and dispatched work teams to the left bank construction site, where beam construction had already begun, for practical operation and visits. The Zhang Shiming crane operating team, which was on duty first on the 12th, proceeded smoothly from the start.

    武汉长江大桥在汉阳武昌同时架桥
    据新华社讯　武汉长江大桥架梁工程，已开始在汉阳和武昌左右两岸同时施工。
    在右岸工地上，12日上午已把一片二十四吨重的钢梁弦杆稳妥地安放到九号桥墩的墩台上。在右岸开始施工前，桥梁建筑者们曾进行了充分的准备工作。8月底，工程师们用图片、图表和模型等，向工人们详细地交代了架梁工程中应注意的技术问题，并且派遣工班到早已开始架梁的左岸工地进行实际操作和参观。12日首先当班的张士明装吊工班，一开始工作就进行得很顺利。
