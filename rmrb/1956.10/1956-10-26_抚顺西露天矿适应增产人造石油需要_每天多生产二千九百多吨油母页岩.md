Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 24th - Since October, the Fushun West Open-Pit Mine has increased its average daily production of oil shale by over 2,900 tons compared to the state plan. This is the result of the mine taking proactive measures to adapt to the increased production of synthetic petroleum at the Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 1.

After the newly built crude oil dry distillation furnace at Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 1 was put into production, it required a large amount of oil shale. However, the West Open-Pit Mine, which extracts oil shale, was undergoing a comprehensive reconstruction project. The construction site had expanded, and the area where oil shale could be extracted had significantly decreased, making it difficult to increase oil shale production. But the workers came up with many solutions to increase oil shale production in the narrow mining area. Electric shovel operators were universally equipped with tools and learned to inspect and repair their own electric shovels. They no longer needed to call the repair workers from the mine pit to come and fix them, reducing the repair time of the electric shovels by nearly 30%. Electric car drivers implemented the advanced experience of hauling more and running faster, promptly transporting the increased oil shale from the mine pit to the synthetic petroleum factory. After the mine added a batch of geological surveyors and laboratory personnel, the geological survey work was accelerated. This not only enabled the electric shovels to be dispatched and transferred to the mining area in a timely manner but also ensured the extraction of better quality oil shale. The laboratory personnel tested the areas to be mined in advance, helping the electric shovel operators grasp the distribution of oil shale and reduce the loss of oil shale.

    抚顺西露天矿适应增产人造石油需要
    每天多生产二千九百多吨油母页岩
    据新华社抚顺24日电　抚顺西露天矿10月以来，平均每天比国家计划增产二千九百多吨油母页岩。这是这个矿为适应东北石油一厂增产人造石油采取积极措施以后的结果。
    东北石油一厂新建的原油干镏炉投入生产以后，需要大量的油母页岩。而开采油母页岩的西露天矿因为正在进行全面改建工程，施工现场扩大，可采油母页岩的地方缩小了很多，使增产油母页岩发生了困难。但是职工们想出很多办法，在狭小的采区里增产油母页岩。电铲司机普遍配备了工具，并且学会自己检查和修理电铲，再不用打电话通知矿坑上的检修工人赶来修理，使电铲的修理时间缩短将近30％。电车司机推行多拉快跑的先进经验以后，把矿坑里增产的油母页岩及时运送给人造石油工厂。这个矿还增添一批地质测量人员和化验人员以后，使地质调查工作加快，这样不仅使电铲能及时调配和转移采区，并且采出质量较好的油母页岩。化验人员提前化验将要采掘的地区，帮助电铲司机掌握油母页岩分布情况，减少油母页岩的损失。
