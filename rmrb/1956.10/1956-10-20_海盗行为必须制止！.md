	Piratical Acts Must Be Stopped!
	On October 15th, in the high seas of the Yellow Sea, naval vessels of the South Korean Syngman Rhee group flagrantly violated our fishing boats engaged in fishing there and kidnapped nine of our crew members, including Li Hongxiu. This is another illegal act by the Syngman Rhee group after its violation of our fishing boats and kidnapping of our fishermen on the high seas on December 25, 1955.
	This unscrupulous piratical behavior of the Syngman Rhee group not only seriously undermines the safety of the high seas and the universally recognized principles of international law regarding freedom of the high seas but is also another provocation against the Chinese people. At a time when the international situation is trending towards relaxation, peaceful coexistence is the common aspiration of people all over the world, and peaceful exchanges between the people of Asian countries are increasingly unfolding, this behavior of the Syngman Rhee group not only arouses the great indignation of the Chinese people but will also inevitably arouse the righteous condemnation of peace-loving people all over the world.
	After committing this lawless piratical act, the Syngman Rhee group, in order to cover up its crime of violating international law, shamelessly distorted and slandered, insisting that the violated Chinese fishing boat had "invaded" South Korean territorial waters. However, our fishing boat was fishing on the high seas of the Yellow Sea, and the location where the Syngman Rhee group's vessels violated our fishing boat and kidnapped our fishing boat crew members was on the high seas at 123 degrees 58 minutes east longitude and 33 degrees 36 minutes north latitude. This is an irrefutable fact. No matter how the Syngman Rhee group fabricates rumors and distortions, it cannot turn the high seas into South Korean territorial waters. This obvious lie of the Syngman Rhee group only further exposes its guilty conscience and futile attempt to cover up its wrongdoing.
	This piratical act by the Syngman Rhee group, which flagrantly violates international law, not only infringes upon the legitimate rights of Chinese fishermen but also harms the interests of fishermen from neighboring countries of South Korea and threatens the safety and freedom of the high seas in this region. The Syngman Rhee group must bear full responsibility for the kidnapping incident on the high seas it created on October 15th. The Chinese people will never tolerate the continuation of this illegal act and provocation by the Syngman Rhee group.

### 海盗行为必须制止！

    海盗行为必须制止！
    10月15日在黄海公海上，南朝鲜李承晚集团的海军舰艇公然侵犯在该处出海捕鱼的我国渔轮，并且绑架了该渔轮上的我国船员李宏秀等九人。这是李承晚集团继1955年12月25日在公海上侵犯我国渔轮并绑走我国渔民以后的又一次不法行为。
    李承晚集团这种肆无忌惮的海盗行为，不仅严重地破坏了公海安全和公海自由这一公认的国际法原则，而且也是对中国人民的又一次挑衅。正当目前国际形势趋向和缓，和平共处是全世界人民的共同愿望，亚洲各国人民和平交往日益展开的时候，李承晚集团的这种行为不仅激起了中国人民的极大的愤怒，而且也一定会引起全世界爱好和平人民的正义的斥责。
    李承晚集团在干了这次无法无天的海盗勾当以后，为了掩盖它的违反国际公法的罪行，还恬不知耻地进行歪曲和诽谤，硬说被侵犯的我国渔轮“侵犯”了南朝鲜的领水。但是，我国渔轮是在黄海公海上进行捕鱼，李承晚集团的舰艇侵犯我国渔轮和绑架我国渔轮船员的地点，是在东经一百二十三度五十八分，北纬三十三度三十六分的公海上，这是铁的事实。李承晚集团不论怎样造谣歪曲，也无法把公海说成是南朝鲜的领水，李承晚集团的这种明显的谎言，只是进一步暴露了它的做贼心虚，欲盖弥彰。
    李承晚集团这种悍然破坏国际公法的海盗行为，不仅侵犯了中国渔民的正当权利，而且损害到同南朝鲜相邻的各国渔民的利益，并且威胁到这个地区公海上的安全和自由。李承晚集团必须对它所制造的10月15日这次公海上的绑架事件负全部的责任。中国人民决不能容忍李承晚集团的这种不法行为和挑衅继续下去。
