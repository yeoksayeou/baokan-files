Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 3rd - The Burmese government issued a formal statement on October 2nd, expressing its support for Egypt's action in nationalizing the Suez Canal and its willingness to promote a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue.

The Burmese government's statement said that it recognizes Egypt's right to nationalize the Suez Canal Company and recognizes Egypt's sovereignty and national rights over the canal, as the canal is recognized as part of Egypt.

The statement said that the Burmese government welcomes the Egyptian government's solemn reaffirmation that it respects the obligations regarding the freedom of navigation on the canal as stipulated by the Convention of Constantinople.

The statement said that the Burmese government has taken serious note of the severe deterioration of the international situation, which could bring about a new war. However, it believes that peaceful consultations can find a solution that respects Egypt's sovereignty while maintaining the rights and interests of the canal's user nations as stipulated by the Convention of Constantinople.

In its statement, the Burmese government hopes that all countries involved in this dispute will strive to foster an atmosphere that allows peaceful consultations to continue and stated that Burma will work with other Colombo countries to continue working towards these goals.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 3rd - Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mono Nunu stated on the 2nd that the Indonesian government believes that a Suez Canal User Association without Egypt's participation "would not be a correct way towards resolving the Suez Canal issue."

The spokesman pointed out that three Asian-African countries, Japan, Pakistan, and Ethiopia, are unwilling to join the association, while Denmark, Norway, and the Netherlands have announced that they are still awaiting the approval of their parliaments. In pointing out this fact, Mono Nunu said that the User Association lacks a solid foundation and is by no means closely united. He said: "So far, this flimsy association does not change the fact that Egypt has complete control over the Suez Canal waterway."

Mono Nunu pointed out that if Egypt refuses to allow User Association ships to use the canal, the User Association will become a "Non-Canal User Association."

    缅甸政府发表正式声明
    表示愿促进和平解决苏伊士问题
    印度尼西亚外交部发言人说“使用国协会”没有坚实基础
    新华社仰光3日电　缅甸政府在10月2日发表正式声明，表示支持埃及把苏伊士运河收归国有的行动，并且愿意促进苏伊士运河问题的和平解决。
    缅甸政府的声明说，它承认埃及有权把苏伊士运河公司收归国有，承认埃及对运河享有主权和民族权利，因为运河被公认是埃及的一部分。
    声明说，缅甸政府欢迎埃及政府庄严地重申它尊重依据君士坦丁堡公约所规定的关于运河自由通航的义务。
    声明说，缅甸政府已经认真地注意到国际局势的严重恶化，这种局势有可能带来新的战争。但是它相信，和平协商会找到尊重埃及主权同时保持根据君士坦丁堡公约所规定的运河使用国的权利和利益的解决办法。
    缅甸政府在声明中希望与这个争端有关的所有国家将努力促成使和平协商可能继续的气氛，并且表示缅甸将同其它科伦坡国家一起努力为达到这些目的而继续工作。
    新华社雅加达3日电　印度尼西亚外交部发言人莫诺努图2日说，印度尼西亚政府认为，没有埃及参加的苏伊士运河使用国协会“将不会成为走向解决苏伊士问题的正确办法”。
    这位发言人指出，日本、巴基斯坦和埃塞俄比亚三个亚非国家不愿参加协会，而丹麦、挪威和荷兰宣布还要等待它们的议会的批准。莫诺努图在指出这个事实时说，使用国协会没有坚实的基础，绝不是紧密联合起来的。他说：“到目前为止，这个不结实的协会并不能改变埃及对苏伊士水道有完全的控制权这一事实”。
    莫诺努图指出，如果埃及拒绝让使用国协会的船只使用运河的话，使用国协会就将变成“非运河使用国协会”。
