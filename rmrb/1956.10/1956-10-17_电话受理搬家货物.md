    Telephone Acceptance of Moving Goods

    Since the Shanghai Railway Transportation Business Office launched the "Telephone Acceptance of Moving Goods" service in March of this year, it has provided great convenience to many cadres and workers who have gone to the Northwest, North China, and other places to participate in socialist construction. In the past, people being transferred had to first contact the passenger transport department to pack their goods, then hire a vehicle to transport them. After the goods were delivered to the business office, they had to buy a freight bill, fill out the bill, and submit a consignment to the business office. After the railway received the goods, they had to wait for payment. This series of procedures often cost movers a lot of energy and time. After the "Telephone Acceptance of Moving Goods" service was launched, movers only need to notify the transportation business office by telephone, and the business office is responsible for delivering the freight bill to their home, as well as packing, picking up the goods, and settling expenses. Moving comrades can have their goods transported without going to the station.

    As of September 27, the Shanghai Transportation Business Office had handled 536 batches of business, which was welcomed by many shippers. At present, the Shanghai Railway Transportation Business Office is increasing staff and preparing to expand this service business. Huang Dehai

    电话受理搬家货物
    上海铁路运输营业所自今年3月份开办“电话受理搬家货物”业务以来，给许多到西北、华北等地参加社会主义建设的干部和工人很大的便利。过去，外调的人要搬家，就先得和客运部门联系包装货物，再雇车搬运，货物送到营业所后还要买货物运单，填写运单和向营业所提出托运，铁路收货后还要等候付款。这一系列的手续往往使搬家的人花费很多的精力和时间。“电话受理搬家货物”业务开展后，搬家的人只要用电话通知运输营业所，营业所即负责把货物运单送到家里，并代为包装，接取货物，清算费用等。搬家的同志不用到车站就可以把货物运出去。
    到9月27日止，上海运输营业所已办理了五百三十六批业务，受到许多运货人的欢迎。目前，上海铁路运输营业所正增加工作人员，准备扩大这项服务性业务。黄德海
