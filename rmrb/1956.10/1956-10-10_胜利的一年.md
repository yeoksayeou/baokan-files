　　A Year of Victory
　　Saifuding, Chairman of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region

    The arrival of the 1956 National Day also marks the first anniversary of the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. This year has been a year of significant achievements in our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, and also a year of significant achievements for Xinjiang in advancing towards socialism after the implementation of national regional autonomy.

    The establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has enabled the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to further enjoy the right to be masters of their own affairs, and has enabled the work in Xinjiang to more fully take into account the characteristics of the development of all ethnic groups. This has further consolidated and developed the unity among all ethnic groups, greatly enhanced the political enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups, and inspired their enthusiasm to participate in the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, providing a reliable guarantee for better developing the political, economic, and cultural aspects of all ethnic groups, and for completing the country's first five-year plan ahead of schedule and exceeding targets.

    Over the past year, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has established and improved autonomous institutions in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and has cultivated and absorbed a large number of activists and representatives from all ethnic groups to participate in government work. Currently, there are more than 51,000 local ethnic minority cadres participating in government organs and various aspects of work at all levels in the autonomous region, accounting for more than 55% of the total number of cadres, which is equivalent to 18 times the number of local ethnic minority cadres in the early days of Xinjiang's liberation. Local ethnic minorities account for more than 84% of the 226 government committee members in the autonomous region's five autonomous prefectures and six autonomous counties. Among the responsible personnel of the political organs in the entire autonomous region, there are 254 local ethnic minority cadres at the level of deputy county head or higher, and 22 deputy commissioners, prefectural governors, and mayors. Among the 43 members and chairpersons of the People's Committee of the autonomous region, there are 34 local ethnic minority personnel. This is an important achievement in the nationalization of state organs in our autonomous region. Through the cultivation and education by the Party and the tempering in practical work, the sense of being masters of their own affairs has been greatly enhanced among cadres of all ethnic groups, and their working ability has been significantly improved. They are closely united with the Han cadres from other regions, and with the enthusiastic help of the Han cadres, they are working with full confidence to build the autonomous region.

    With the emergence and development of the high tide of socialist revolution across the country, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has achieved a decisive victory in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce over the past year. In terms of the socialist transformation of agriculture, in the seven months from October last year to April this year, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives of the primary form in the entire autonomous region has increased from the original 1,702 to 10,781, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives has reached 834,571, accounting for 91.93% of the total number of peasant households, basically completing the primary form of collectivization. On the basis of the primary form of agricultural collectivization, the advanced form of agricultural collectivization has also greatly developed. By April this year, the northern Xinjiang region had basically completed the advanced form of collectivization, and one-third of the peasant households in the southern Xinjiang region had also joined the advanced agricultural cooperatives. In terms of the socialist transformation of handicrafts and private industry and commerce, the number of handicraft cooperatives has now increased to 541, the number of supply and marketing production cooperatives (groups) has increased to 525, and the number of people joining the cooperatives and groups has reached 83.8% of the total number of handicraft practitioners. The number of private industrial enterprises that have undergone transformation is 488, accounting for 94.39% of the total number of private industrial enterprises with three or more employees. The number of private commercial enterprises that have undergone transformation is 23,875, accounting for 95.64% of the total number of private commercial enterprises. Under the influence of the high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in animal husbandry in the entire autonomous region has also greatly developed. When the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region was first established, there were only three animal husbandry production cooperatives and 1,858 temporary and permanent mutual aid groups. By May this year, there were 319 animal husbandry cooperatives and 6,431 temporary and permanent mutual aid groups, with the number of herdsmen joining the cooperatives and groups accounting for more than 50% of the total number of herdsmen, which has created favorable conditions for the future implementation of the socialist transformation of animal husbandry. The healthy development and decisive victory of the socialist transformation in the autonomous region is the result of the autonomous region's correct implementation of the Party's policies and guidelines in ethnic minority areas. This victory has significant historical significance for developing the autonomous region's political, economic, and cultural and educational undertakings in the future, concentrating efforts on socialist construction, and enabling the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region and all the people of our country to jointly transition to a prosperous and happy socialist society.

    Due to the rapid development of socialist transformation and the changes in the relations of production, the enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups for production has been unprecedentedly high. Over the past year, the industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production of the autonomous region has greatly developed. In terms of industry, the total industrial output value in 1955 reached 200.27 million yuan, an increase of nearly 35 times compared with 1949. Since the spring of this year, workers and staff of all ethnic groups have launched an advanced producers' movement with unparalleled labor enthusiasm, and both output value and output have increased significantly, and quality has also improved. In the first half of this year, 36 local state-owned and joint state-private factories and mines in the autonomous region have completed 101.18% of the total output value plan. In terms of agriculture, the grain output in 1955 was 3.8 billion jin, an increase of 88% compared with 1949, and the cotton output was 52.2 million jin, an increase of more than four times compared with 1949. In the past, some areas in Xinjiang lacked grain, but now it can not only be self-sufficient, but also has a considerable amount available for storage and external transfer. This year's agricultural production has also achieved a bumper harvest, and the yield per unit area in many areas in both northern and southern Xinjiang has increased by about 20% compared with last year. The bumper harvest of crops will enable more than 90% of the members of agricultural cooperatives to increase their income, which has strengthened the confidence of farmers of all ethnic groups in taking the road of collectivization and further enhanced their enthusiasm for production. This year, the 500,000 mu of winter and spring wheat of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps also achieved large-scale bumper harvests, with the yield per unit area increasing by about 20% compared with last year. The agricultural production corps is now establishing new farms on more than one million mu of wasteland in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. The largest cotton-growing farm in the country, the Anjihai Farm, has been completed, with a cultivated area of more than 320,000 mu. The production achievements of the Production and Construction Corps have always been a model for farmers of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region to learn from, and farmers of all ethnic groups are learning the production technology and advanced experience of the corps with great enthusiasm. In terms of animal husbandry production, by the end of 1955, the total number of livestock in the entire autonomous region had reached 18,755,982 heads, an increase of nearly 56% compared with 1949. The planned number of livestock in 1956 is 20,932,490 heads. Judging from the production situation this spring, this year's production increase plan can be overfulfilled.

    While the socialist transformation is victorious and industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production are rapidly developing, the cultural, educational, and health undertakings of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are also rapidly developing. This year, the autonomous region has newly built two institutions of higher learning, eight secondary vocational schools, and 32 ordinary middle schools. At present, there are five institutions of higher learning, 20 secondary vocational schools, 94 ordinary middle schools, and 2,186 primary schools in the entire autonomous region; the number of students enrolled has increased by 35% compared with 1955, and the number of university enrollments has increased by 93.2%. In order to better develop the cultural, educational, and health undertakings of all ethnic groups, we have also studied the work of reforming the written languages of the Uyghur, Kazakh, Mongolian, and other ethnic groups, in order to prepare for the reform of the written languages of all ethnic groups. In terms of health undertakings, the number of hospitals in 1955 increased by 82% compared with 1949, the number of hospital beds increased by 1.2 times, and the number of health technicians was 2,602, an increase of six times compared with 1949. Since this spring, in coordination with the agricultural collectivization movement, more than 2,000 health workers and nursery workers have been trained for agricultural cooperatives, and 818 health rooms have been established. The patriotic health movement has continued to be carried out in urban and rural areas, and the prevention and treatment of local diseases have been carried out, ensuring the health of the people of all ethnic groups.

    The achievements of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region over the past year are the result of the correct leadership of the Party, the deep concern of the state, the support and assistance of the people of all ethnic groups across the country, especially the Han people, and the concerted efforts of the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region. The people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have deeply realized the correctness and greatness of the Party's policy of national regional autonomy from their own experience, and have understood the warmth of living in the big family of the People's Republic of China.

    Of course, we are by no means satisfied with these achievements, and we are also clearly aware that there are still many shortcomings and errors in our work in various aspects. We are determined and confident to correct these shortcomings and errors.

    Now, the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which is of great historical significance, has successfully concluded. The people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region must, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely complete the tasks put forward by this Party Congress. In order to successfully complete the tasks put forward by the Party Congress, smoothly complete the socialist transformation and accelerate the advancement of socialist construction, we must make greater efforts in the following aspects in the future:

    First, with the upcoming completion of the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Aktogay Railway, the state has decided to designate the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region as one of the key areas for industrial construction in our country's second five-year plan for the development of the national economy. A high tide of industrial construction will soon appear in the autonomous region. Under this situation, we must accelerate the completion of the task of socialist transformation, actively develop agricultural and animal husbandry production, and prepare conditions for large-scale industrial construction. Although the autonomous region has achieved a decisive victory in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, it has not yet been fully completed, especially the socialist transformation of animal husbandry is still in the trial stage. We must strive to fully complete the primary form of agricultural collectivization and basically complete the advanced form of agricultural collectivization this winter and next spring, and begin the socialist transformation of animal husbandry this autumn, striving to basically complete the socialist transformation of animal husbandry in the primary form and basically complete the establishment of joint state-private pastures by 1958. In terms of handicrafts, we should strive to fully complete the primary form of collectivization and basically complete the advanced form of collectivization next year. In terms of private industry and commerce, we should strive to change capitalist ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people by the end of 1958 or a slightly longer period. In this way, the socialist transformation can be completely victorious in three to five years.

    The agricultural and animal husbandry production of the autonomous region has already developed considerably, but it still cannot meet the needs of large-scale industrial construction. Therefore, vigorously developing agriculture and animal husbandry remains our current central task. We must grasp the central link of agricultural technology reform and take various effective measures to vigorously develop agricultural production; we must actively improve feeding management, improve livestock breeds, cultivate pastureland, prevent and control epidemics and natural disasters, and take other measures to vigorously develop animal husbandry production. In order to prepare conditions for large-scale industrial construction, we must also seize the time to compile a development plan for industry, vigorously conduct resource exploration, actively cultivate technical forces and industrial cadres, and build necessary factories and mines to serve agricultural and animal husbandry production and capital construction. At the same time, we must run existing factories and mines well, continue to deepen the advanced producers' movement, and increase output and product quality. We must also vigorously support the development of the Karamay oil area and the construction of the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Aktogay Railway.

    Second, under the situation of the rapid development of socialist transformation and socialist construction, the issue of cadres is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. The main methods we have used in the past to train and promote cadres were to discover and cultivate them in the democratic reform movement, the socialist transformation movement, and various practical work, and to train and cultivate them by running various short-term training classes and primary Party schools. This was correct, and we still need to do so in the future. However, the fundamental way to solve the cadre problem is to develop the autonomous region's education, so in addition to the above methods, we must also pay great attention to developing various regular schools in the future. Adding Chinese language classes to the middle schools and institutions of higher learning in the autonomous region is of great significance for cultivating local ethnic minority cadres and construction talents in various fields, and for developing the autonomous region's cultural and economic undertakings. In our education work in the future, we should pay attention to and strengthen this work. In order to accelerate the development of the autonomous region's socialist transformation and socialist construction, we also hope for and warmly welcome the strong support of Han scientific and technical personnel and work cadres from the inland.

    Third, the close unity among all ethnic groups is the fundamental factor that enables us to successfully complete various work tasks. In the future, we must continue to implement the Party's policy of ethnic unity, continue to overcome and prevent the ideological tendencies of great Han chauvinism (for the Han people, and also Uyghur chauvinism in Xinjiang) and local nationalism, as well as various factors that are unfavorable to ethnic unity, and continue to consolidate and expand the national democratic united front, adhere to long-term unity and cooperation with patriotic democratic people from all ethnic groups, all strata, and all walks of life, give full play to the enthusiasm of each person, and, under the leadership of the Party, jointly do a good job in the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the autonomous region.

    Fourth, we must correct our work style and strive to correct shortcomings and errors in our work. At present, the main thing is to oppose bad ideologies and work styles such as subjectivism, bureaucratism, commandism, and pragmatism, emphasize that leading cadres go deep into the lower levels, go deep among the masses, earnestly implement Chairman Mao's instructions of "from the masses, to the masses," and "concentrate, persevere" the leadership style and work style of the mass line, and rely on the strength and wisdom of the broad masses of the people to do our work well.

    The achievements of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in the year since its establishment inspire our confidence in moving forward victoriously. We must unite more closely around the Communist Party of China, work hard and forge ahead for the prosperity and development of the autonomous region and for the construction of a happy and prosperous socialist society!

　　胜利的一年
　　新疆维吾尔自治区主席　赛福鼎
    在1956年国庆节到来的时候，也正是新疆维吾尔自治区成立一周年。这一年，是我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业获得重大成就的一年，也是新疆实行民族区域自治后在向社会主义迈进中获得重大成就的一年。
    新疆维吾尔自治区的成立，使新疆各族人民进一步享受到了当家作主的权利，使新疆各项工作的进行，更充分地照顾到了各民族发展的特点，这就进一步地巩固和发展了各民族间的团结，大大提高了各族人民的政治积极性，鼓舞了他们参加国家社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的热情，为更好地发展各民族的政治经济文化，提前和超额完成国家的第一个五年计划提供了可靠的保证。
    一年来，新疆维吾尔自治区按照中华人民共和国宪法的规定，建立和健全了自治机构，并培养和吸收了大批各民族的积极分子和代表人物参加政权工作。现在，参加自治区各级政权机关和各方面工作的本地民族干部已有五万一千余人，占干部总数的55％以上，相当于新疆解放初期本地民族干部的十八倍；在自治区的五个自治州、六个自治县的二百二十六个政府委员中，本地各民族占84％以上；全自治区政权机关的负责人员中有本地民族正副县长级干部二百五十四人，正副专员、州长和市长二十二人；在自治区人民委员会四十三名委员和正副主席中，有本地民族人员三十四人。这是我们自治区国家机关民族化的一个重要成就。各民族干部经过党的培养教育和在实际工作中的锻炼，主人翁的思想大大增强，工作能力显著提高。他们和外来的汉族干部亲密团结，并在汉族干部的热情帮助下，正满怀信心地为建设自治区而努力。
    随着全国范围内社会主义革命高潮的出现和发展，一年来，新疆维吾尔自治区已取得了对农业、手工业和私营工商业社会主义改造的决定性的胜利。在对农业的社会主义改造方面，由去年10月到今年4月的七个月当中，全自治区初级形式的农业生产合作社已由原来的一千七百零二个发展到一万零七百八十一个，入社农户已达八十三万四千五百七十一户，占总农户的91，93％，基本上完成了初级形式的合作化。在初级形式农业合作化的基础上，高级形式的农业合作化也有很大发展，到今年4月，北疆地区已基本上完成高级形式的合作化，南疆地区也有三分之一的农户加入了高级农业社。在对手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造方面，现在手工业合作社已发展到五百四十一个，供销生产社（组）已发展到五百二十五个，入社入组人数已达手工业从业人员总数的83.8％；已进行改造的私营工业有四百八十八户，占具有三个职工以上的私营工业总户数的94.39％；已进行改造的私营商业有二万三千八百七十五户，占私营商业总户数的95.64％。在农业、手工业和私营工商业社会主义改造高潮的影响下，全自治区畜牧业的互助合作运动也有了很大发展。在新疆维吾尔自治区刚成立时，牧业生产合作社只有三个，临时和常年互助组只有一千八百五十八个。到今年5月，牧业社已有三百一十九个，临时和常年互助组已有六千四百三十一个，入社入组的牧民占牧民总数的50％以上，这就为今后实行对畜牧业的社会主义改造创造了有利条件。自治区社会主义改造事业的健康发展和取得决定性的胜利，是自治区正确贯彻党在民族地区方针政策的结果。这种胜利对于今后发展自治区的政治、经济和文化教育事业，集中力量进行社会主义建设，使自治区各族人民和我国全体人民共同过渡到繁荣幸福的社会主义社会具有重大的历史意义。
    由于社会主义改造事业的迅速发展和生产关系的改变，各族人民的生产积极性空前高涨。一年来，自治区工农牧业生产有了很大的发展。在工业方面，1955年工业总产值达二亿零二十七万元，比1949年增加了近三十五倍。今年春天以来，各族职工以无比的劳动热情开展了先进生产者运动，产值产量都有很大增长，质量也有提高。今年上半年，自治区地方国营和公私合营等三十六个厂矿已完成总产值计划101.18％。在农业方面，1955年粮食产量三十八亿斤，比1949年增加88％，棉花产量五千二百二十万斤，比1949年增加了四倍多。过去新疆有些地区缺粮，现在不仅可以自给，而且有相当数量可供储备和外调。今年农业生产又获得丰收，南北疆许多地区的单位面积产量都比去年提高20％左右。农作物的丰收，将可使农业社90％以上的社员增加收入，这就坚定了各族农民走合作化道路的信心，进一步提高了他们的生产积极性。今年驻新疆生产建设部队的五十万亩冬春小麦也获得大面积丰产，单位面积产量比去年提高20％左右。现在农业生产部队正在天山南北一百多万亩荒原上建立新农场，全国最大的植棉农场——安集海农场已经建成，耕地面积达三十二万多亩。生产建设部队的生产成就一直是新疆维吾尔自治区各族农民学习的榜样，各族农民正以极大的热情学习部队的生产技术和先进经验。在畜牧业生产方面，到1955年底，全自治区牲畜头数已达一千八百七十五万五千九百八十二头，比1949年增加了近56％；1956年牲畜头数计划达到二千零九十三万二千四百九十头，根据今春生产情况来看，今年的增产计划是可以超额完成的。
    与社会主义改造的胜利和工农牧业生产迅速开展的同时，新疆维吾尔自治区的文教卫生事业也有迅速的开展。今年自治区新建了二所高等学校，八所中等专业学校，三十二所普通中学。现在，全自治区已有五所高等学校，二十所中等专业学校，九十四所普通中学，二千一百八十六所小学；入学人数较1955年增加35％，大学入学人数增加93.2％。为了更好地开展各民族的文教卫生事业，我们并研究了维吾尔、哈萨克、蒙古等民族的文字改革工作，以便有准备地进行各民族文字的改革。在卫生事业方面，到1955年医院比1949年增加了82％，病床增加了一点二倍，卫生技术人员二千六百零二人，比1949年增加了六倍。今春以来，配合农业合作化运动给农业社训练了保健员、保育员二千多人，建立了保健室八百一十八个；并继续在城乡开展了爱国卫生运动，进行了地方病的防治工作，保障了各族人民的身体健康。
    新疆维吾尔自治区一年来的成就，是党的正确领导、国家的深切关怀、全国各族人民特别是汉族人民的支援帮助和自治区各族人民一致努力的结果。新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民从亲身体验中，深刻认识到党的民族区域自治政策的正确和伟大，领会到生活在中华人民共和国大家庭中的温暖。
    当然，我们绝不满足于这些成绩，我们也清楚地知道，在我们各方面工作中还存在许多缺点和错误。我们有决心和信心改正这些缺点和错误。
    现在具有伟大历史意义的中国共产党第八次全国代表大会已经胜利闭幕。新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民要和全国人民一道，坚决完成这次党代表大会提出来的任务。为了很好地完成党代表大会提出来的任务，圆满完成社会主义改造和加速推进社会主义建设事业，我们今后必须从以下几方面作更大的努力：
    第一、随着兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿克斗卡铁路的即将修通，国家已决定将新疆维吾尔自治区作为我国发展国民经济第二个五年计划内工业建设的重点地区之一，自治区不久将出现工业建设的高潮。在这种形势下，我们必须加速完成社会主义改造的任务，积极开展农牧业生产，为大规模工业建设准备条件。自治区对农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造虽已取得决定性的胜利，但是还没有全部完成，特别是对畜牧业的社会主义改造还处在试办阶段。我们必须努力在今冬明春全部完成初级形式的农业合作化和基本上完成农业的高级合作化，并自今年秋季开始进行对畜牧业的社会主义改造，争取在1958年基本上完成对畜牧业初级形式的社会主义改造，和基本上完成建立公私合营牧场的工作。手工业方面，要争取在明年全部完成初级形式的合作化和基本上完成高级形式的合作化。私营工商业方面，争取在1958年底或稍长时间改变资本主义所有制为社会主义的全民所有制。这样，在三、五年内社会主义改造就可获得全胜。
    自治区的农牧业生产已有相当大的发展，但是还不能适应大规模工业建设的需要，因此，大力发展农牧业仍然是我们当前的中心任务。我们必须抓紧农业技术改革这一中心环节，并采取各种有效措施，大力发展农业生产；我们必须积极改善饲养管理、改良牲畜品种、培植草牧场、防治疫病和自然灾害，并采取其他措施，大力发展畜牧业生产。为了给大规模工业建设准备条件，我们还必须抓紧编制发展工业规划方案，大力进行资源勘查，积极培养技术力量和工业干部，并兴建必要的为农牧业生产和基本建设服务的厂矿。同时，要办好现有厂矿，继续深入开展先进生产者运动，提高产量和产品质量。并要大力支援克拉玛依油区的开发和兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿克斗卡铁路的修建工作。
    第二、在社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业飞速发展的形势下，干部问题是一个迫切需要解决的问题。我们过去培养提拔干部的主要办法，是在民主改革运动、社会主义改造运动和各种实际工作中发现和培养的，同时开办各种短期训练班和初级党校来训练和培养。这样做是正确的，今后还需要这样做。但是，解决干部问题的基本办法是发展自治区的教育事业，因此除了上述办法外，今后还必须十分重视发展各种正规学校。在自治区的中学和高等学校中增加汉文课，这对培养本地民族干部和各方面的建设人才、发展自治区的文化、经济事业具有重大的意义，今后我们在教育工作中，应该重视和加强这一工作。为了加速自治区社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业的发展，我们还希望并热烈欢迎内地的汉族科学技术人员和各方面的工作干部的大力支援。
    第三、各民族间的亲密团结是我们能够胜利完成各项工作任务的基本因素。今后我们必须继续贯彻党的民族团结政策，继续克服和防止大民族主义（对汉族的，在新疆来说同样是对维吾尔族的）和地方民族主义的思想倾向，以及各种不利于民族团结的因素，并继续巩固和扩大民族民主统一战线，坚持同各民族、各阶层、各界爱国民主人士的长期团结合作，充分发挥每个人的积极性，在党的领导下，共同搞好自治区的社会主义建设和社会主义改造工作。
    第四、要端正我们的工作作风，努力改正工作中的缺点和错误。目前主要的是要反对主观主义、官僚主义、命令主义和事务主义等不良思想和工作作风，强调领导干部深入下层，深入群众，切实贯彻毛主席指示的“从群众中来，到群众中去”，“集中起来，坚持下去”的群众路线的领导作风和工作作风，依靠广大人民群众的力量和智慧做好我们的工作。
    新疆维吾尔自治区成立一年来的成就，鼓舞着我们胜利前进的信心。我们要更加紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，为自治区的繁荣发展、为建设幸福美满的社会主义社会而努力劳动，奋勇前进！
