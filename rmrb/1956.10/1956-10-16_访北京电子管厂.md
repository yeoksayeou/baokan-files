Visiting the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory
By our reporter Liu Shiping

Our country’s first modern vacuum tube enterprise, the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, officially started production yesterday.

On the eve of the opening, Lin Wei, the factory’s deputy director for economics, and Li Xuezhi, the chief designer, led us to visit the entire production process. First, we went to a workshop that manufactures tungsten wire, molybdenum wire, and Dumet wire. The equipment in this workshop is all automated and semi-automated. Groups of machines in this workshop automatically draw tungsten billets as thick as a pen into 0.012 mm tungsten wire through several processes. It is finer than human hair, so much so that it is almost invisible to the naked eye when placed about a meter away. Tungsten wire is an important raw material for making filaments in electron tubes. Before liberation, this important raw material was always imported from abroad. After the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory is built, the tungsten wire, molybdenum wire, and Dumet wire it produces will not only be used by the factory itself, but also supplied to other factories.

The production characteristic of this factory is precise and strict process requirements, and complex technology. It requires thousands of raw materials, including precious rare metals and special chemical materials or high-purity gases. Of the more than ninety elements on the periodic table of chemical elements, more than forty are necessary materials for the factory's production. A thumbnail-sized electronic tube requires hundreds of materials. In the production process, each material must undergo strict inspection and testing. The trial-produced electron tubes must also undergo vibration tests, life tests, and other processes before they can leave the factory. In order to adapt to the production characteristics of electron tubes, this factory has built many well-equipped laboratories.

From the tungsten-molybdenum workshop to other workshops, each workshop and each building are connected by sky bridge-style stairs, and the surroundings are closed with double-layer glass. The reason is that the entire process of producing electron tubes requires a very clean environment. Vacuum hygiene is an important condition to ensure that no defective products are produced.

The section chief in the indirectly heated small tube assembly workshop is a university graduate. He pointed to this closed factory building and told me: "The so-called closed is not to say that air does not circulate. In fact, the workshop has the latest ventilation equipment, which can regulate the air and maintain the indoor temperature and humidity. It only means that with a closed device, wind, sand, and dust cannot be blown into the factory building, and even a trace of oil cannot contaminate the vacuum tube, lest the tube ‘poison’ and lose its vacuum function."

Most of the workers working in the assembly workshop are young women. They all wear snow-white work clothes, sit quietly at the workbenches, press the buttons with their hands, and watch the microscopes, assembling the finest parts into a formed electron tube, and then send it to the heat treatment section for sealing and continue various processing and inspections. Before these female assemblers entered the factory to work, they all underwent sweat tests. People with a lot of hand sweat cannot work here, because sweat contains chlorine, which will "poison or oxidize metal parts" of the cathode manufacturing electron tubes, resulting in defective products. A female section chief said that the hands of the workers in her section must be washed with water or alcohol once every hour.

There is a mounting girl, Wang Shouyuan, who is only eighteen years old this year. She started trial-producing electron tubes in July, and it has only been more than three months, but she has already been able to preliminarily master the technology.

Many of the machines in the electronic tube factory are new, and these equipments are all supplied by the Soviet Union.

The 15th was the opening day of the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory. People from various positions who came to participate in the opening ceremony stroked the thumb-sized electronic tube, and faced with such a new, beautiful, and clean automated factory, they gave knowing smiles.

Talking about the application of electron tubes, Li Xuezhi, the chief designer of the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, told me in simple terms: Electron tubes are the heart of radio. The sound transmitted from the screen in the cinema, as well as the images we see in the television receiver, all have electron tubes playing a role. In the process of my country’s industrialization, increasingly developing large enterprises have put forward requirements for automation, and a high degree of automation cannot be separated from electron tubes. In recent years, the electronic computers in scientific research have thousands to ten thousand electronic tubes. Because the electron tube has the effect of amplification and reacts quickly, it can be used to construct precision measuring instruments in scientific research to observe weak or extremely rapid changes. In the peaceful use of atomic energy, electronic instruments are also indispensable.

When talking about the issue of production cooperation, the comrades in the factory have a common hope, requesting that the metallurgical, chemical, petroleum, and geological departments can help them solve the supply of raw materials. Because the manufacture of electron tubes requires many types of raw materials, the decisive materials require relatively strict requirements. Only with the assistance and support of relevant domestic departments can my country’s electron tube industry be developed more rapidly.

    访北京电子管厂
    本报记者　刘时平
    我国第一个现代化的电真空企业——北京电子管厂，在昨天正式开工投入生产了。
    开工前夕，这个厂的经济副厂长林巍和总设计师李学智带领着我们参观了全厂的生产过程。首先我们到了一个制造钨丝、钼丝和杜美丝的车间。这个车间的设备全部是自动化和半自动化的。这个车间里的一组一组的机器，把一根根有钢笔粗的钨坯经过几道工序，自动拉成0.012毫米的钨丝，它比人的头发还要细得多，以致把它放在一公尺左右的地方，肉眼几乎很难看得见。钨丝是做电子管里的热丝的重要原材料，在解放前，这种重要的原材料，一向是靠国外进口。北京电子管厂建成后，它制成的钨丝、钼丝和杜美丝，不仅供给自己厂子里用，还可以供应其他厂的需要。
    这个工厂的生产特点是工艺要求精密严格，技术复杂，它需用的原料有几千种，其中有贵重的稀有金属和特殊的化学材料或纯度很高的气体。化学元素周期表上的九十多种元素中，有四十多种是这个厂生产的必需材料。一个像大拇指那样小的电子管，就需要几百种材料。在生产过程中，对每种材料都要经过严格的检查化验，试做成的电子管，也要经过振动试验、寿命试验等等过程才能出厂。为了适应电子管生产的特点，这个厂建有许多设备良好的试验室。
    从钨钼车间转到其它的车间，一个车间和一个车间，一座场房和一座场房，都是用天桥式的楼梯连接着，周围都用双层玻璃闭合起来。原因是生产电子管的整个过程，都需要十分清洁的环境，真空卫生是保证不出废品的重要条件。
    在旁热式小型管装配车间里的工段长是一个大学毕业生，他指着这个闭合式的厂房告诉我：“所谓封闭，不是说不通空气，实际上车间里有最新式的通风设备，可以调节空气，还可以保持室内的温湿度。只是说有了闭合式的装置，可以不让风沙，灰尘吹进场房，甚至一点油渍都不能沾染真空管，以免管子
  ‘中毒’失去真空作用。”
    在装配车间里工作的工人，大部分是年轻的姑娘。她们都穿着雪白的工作服，静坐在工作台上，手按着电钮、眼看着显微镜，把最细微的零件装配成一个成型的电子管，然后送到热工段封口，并继续进行各种加工和检验。这些女装配工进厂工作以前，都经过手汗检查，手汗多的人不能在这里工作，因为汗内有氯，氯会使制造电子管的阴极“中毒或氧化金属零件”而造成废品。一位女工段长说，她那个工段工人的手，每小时还要用水或酒精洗擦一次。
    有一个装架女工王守媛，今年才十八岁。她从7月份开始试制电子管，到现在，只有三个多月的工夫，但她已经可以初步掌握技术了。
    电子管工厂的机器，有许多是新式的，这些设备，都是苏联供应的。
    15日，是北京电子管厂开工的一天。从各个不同岗位来参加开工典礼的人们，抚摸着拇指式电子管，面对着这样一个新型、美丽、干净的自动化工厂，发出了会心的微笑。
    谈到电子管的应用，北京电子管厂的总设计师李学智以深入浅出的道理告诉我：电子管是无线电的心脏。我们在电影院看电影，由银幕上传出来的声音，以及我们在电视接收机中看到显现出来的图像等等，也都有电子管在起作用。在我国工业化的过程中，日益发展的大企业，提出了自动化的要求，高度的自动化就离不开电子管。近年来在科学研究中的电子计算机，其中有数千到一万个电子管。由于电子管具有放大作用和反应迅速，可以用它构成科学研究上的精密测量仪器，来观测微弱的或极其迅速的变化。在和平利用原子能方面，电子仪器也是不可缺少的。
    谈到生产协作问题的时候，厂里的同志们有一个共同的希望，要求冶金、化工、石油和地质部门能够帮助他们解决原材料的供应问题。因为制造电子管需要很多品种的原材料，其中决定性的材料要求比较严格，只有国内有关部门予以协助和支援，才能使我国的电子管工业，得到更迅速的发展。
