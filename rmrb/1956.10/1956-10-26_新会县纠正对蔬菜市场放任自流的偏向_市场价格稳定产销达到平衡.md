Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 23rd: Xinhua News Agency reporter Liang Fuqing reports: The state-owned vegetable company of Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, has corrected the laissez-faire tendency in its leadership and management of the county town’s free vegetable market, overcoming the phenomena of fluctuating vegetable market prices and disconnect between production and sales that had occurred.

In mid-August, Xinhui County opened a state-led free vegetable market in the county town. In the early stages of the opening, the cadres of the state-owned vegetable company mistakenly believed that opening a free market meant that the state-owned company no longer needed to manage the market, and that prices and supply and demand could be left to their own devices. As a result, the purchasing stations of the state-owned company stopped posting prices for many important vegetables and failed to guide the suburban farmers to harvest vegetables for the market in a planned manner according to market needs. As a result, the amount of vegetables on the market varied greatly, especially scallions, where the amount on the market sometimes exceeded the demand by a factor of two. Local and out-of-town small traders who purchased vegetables saw this situation and lowered purchase prices and raised selling prices. For example, the purchase price of garlic chives was reduced from 14 cents per jin to 7 cents, and then sold for 16 cents per jin; for the popular luffa, the purchase price was raised from the usual 5.5 yuan per dan to 8 yuan per dan, and then retailed for 15 cents per jin, which was nearly twice the normal retail price. As a result, farmers suffered losses, and some agricultural cooperatives prepared to change their land to grow sweet potatoes instead of vegetables.

After discovering these problems, the state-owned vegetable company immediately ordered the purchasing stations to restore the posting of prices and to purchase vegetables. At the same time, it sent cadres to the suburbs to apologize to the farmers for failing to take responsibility for leading the market. It also educated members of the agricultural cooperatives to produce vegetables in a planned way and to transport them to the market in a planned way. Subsequently, the state-owned company helped the agricultural cooperatives to formulate vegetable production and marketing plans for the next few months, based on the normal needs of the market, so as to achieve batch planting, diversification of planting, and batch marketing, and to avoid the accumulation of spoilage and out-of-stock phenomena caused by the variable quantity of vegetables on the market. The agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs had originally planned to plant large quantities of Chinese cabbage, cabbage, and radishes, each of which would produce 100,000 dan, far exceeding the demand. After adjustment, in addition to planting these vegetables, some of the land will be rotated to grow jade beans, purple eggplant, and yuan peppers, which can be transported north. In order to grasp the amount of vegetables on the market for the next day, the company also designated special personnel to frequently contact the various townships in the suburbs to understand which vegetables in each township were ripe and how much was on the market. The agricultural cooperatives also reported the planned varieties and quantities to be marketed the next day to the state-owned company, so that the company could adjust the plan based on the needs of the local and foreign markets, guide the flow of goods, and organize transactions.

The state-owned company held special meetings with the small traders and educated them. It also allowed farmers and residents to express their opinions on their practices of suppressing prices and raising prices. Every day, the company also sent people to the cooperative groups of merchants and the market to understand their business style and difficulties. It sent people to the countryside to listen to the opinions of the farmers, and immediately educated the small traders to correct any bad business practices that were discovered. The state-owned company also allowed the small traders to purchase more popular goods, and helped those who had financial difficulties to obtain loans from banks. It also organized them to go to various districts in the county to purchase vegetables that were not produced in the suburbs of the county town, so that the small traders could increase their income by expanding their legitimate business. After these efforts, the vegetable merchants changed their speculative practices and automatically posted the purchase and sale prices of vegetables every day. Their turnover in September increased by 23% compared to August. Many small traders reflected: Since this can improve our lives, why pursue exorbitant profits and be scolded by others?

After the state-owned vegetable company corrected its tendency to relax management, the prices in the county town's free vegetable market have remained stable. The daily amount of vegetables on the market and the amount of transactions have been maintained at around 30,000 to 40,000 jin, and production and sales have reached a balance.

    新会县纠正对蔬菜市场放任自流的偏向
    市场价格稳定产销达到平衡
    新华社广州23日电　新华社记者梁福擎报道：广东省新会县国营蔬菜公司纠正对县城蔬菜自由市场领导管理上的放任自流偏向，克服了蔬菜市场价格一度波动、产销一度脱节的现象。
    新会县城在8月中旬开辟国家领导下的蔬菜自由市场。在开辟初期，国营蔬菜公司的干部误认为开辟自由市场就是国营公司对市场可以不再管理了，对价格和供求状况都可任其自流，于是国营公司的收购站对很多种重要蔬菜的价格不再挂牌，也不指导郊区农民按市场的需要情况有计划地采摘蔬菜上市。结果上市的蔬菜时多时少，特别是葱，有时上市量比需要量多了一倍。当地和外地采购蔬菜的小商小贩看到这种情况，便压价收购，抬价出卖。如把韭菜花的收购价从一角四分一斤压低到七分，再以一角六分一斤出卖；对于畅销的胜瓜，把收购价从平常的五元五角一担抬高到八元一担，然后再以一角五分一斤零售，比正常的零售价贵了将近一倍。因此农民吃了亏，有些农业社准备把土地改种番薯，不再种菜。
    国营蔬菜公司在发现这些情况以后，立即要收购站恢复挂出牌价，收购蔬菜，同时派干部到郊区各乡向农民检讨没有负起责任领导市场的过错，并教育农业社社员有计划地生产蔬菜和有计划地输送上市。接着，国营公司又根据市场的正常需要情况，帮助农业社制定几个月内的蔬菜生产和上市计划，做到分批种植、种植多样化和分批上市，避免上市量时多时少而致发生积压霉烂和脱销现象。郊区农业社原来都计划大量种植白菜、椰菜和萝白，每种都将生产十万担，超过需要量很多。经过调整，现在除了种这些菜以外，还将一部分地改为轮种，种植可以北运的玉豆、紫茄、元椒等蔬菜。为了逐日掌握次日的蔬菜上市量，公司又指定专人经常同郊区各乡联系，了解各乡哪些蔬菜已经成熟，有多少上市等情况。农业社每天也把次日要上市的品种、数量计划报给国营公司，以便公司根据本地和外地市场的需要情况，对计划进行调节，指导商品流向，组织成交。
    对于小商小贩，国营公司专门召集他们开会进行教育，并让农民、居民对他们的压价抬价行为提意见。每天公司还派人到各商贩合作小组和市场去了解他们的经营作风和困难，派人下乡倾听农民的意见，一发现有不良的经营作风就立即教育小商贩改正。国营公司还让小商贩多收购一些畅销货，对于资金困难的小商贩则帮助他们向银行贷款，并且组织他们到县内各区去收购县城郊区没有生产的蔬菜，使小商贩能靠扩大正当的营业来增加收入。经过这些工作，蔬菜商贩改变了投机倒把作风，每天自动地把蔬菜的购销价格用牌标明出来。他们9月份的营业额比8月份增加了23％。许多小商贩都反映：既然这样可以改善生活，又何必去追求暴利，挨别人的责骂。
    国营蔬菜公司纠正放松管理的偏向以后，这个县城蔬菜自由市场的价格一直稳定，每天蔬菜上市和成交数量都保持在三、四万斤左右，产销达到了平衡。
