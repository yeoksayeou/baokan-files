Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th. Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese government today mobilized 1,200 police officers to forcibly conduct land surveying work in Sunagawa Town, resulting in a large-scale conflict and a bloody incident in which 264 people were injured.

The land surveying work carried out by the Japanese government to expand the US Tachikawa Air Force Base in Sunagawa Town began on October 4th. Due to the resolute opposition of local residents, the surveying work has not been formally carried out. At 3:15 p.m. today, the Japanese government sent a large contingent of police officers, led by armored vehicles, in forty trucks to Sunagawa Town, near Tokyo. After rudely dragging away Socialist Party Diet members who were blocking their advance, they then charged at a picket line composed of 3,000 local residents and workers and students who came to support them.

The police's attack was met with resistance from the masses, resulting in a fierce conflict. The conflict lasted for one hour. According to statistics, as of 9:00 p.m. tonight, 186 people on the side of the masses were injured, including 12 seriously injured. The police also said that 76 police officers were injured.

The police's brutality has aroused public outrage in Japan. Representatives of the Japanese Socialist Party visited Defense Agency Director-General Funada Naka at 5:00 p.m. that day, demanding that the government stop the forced surveying work. The Socialist Party also demanded that the government negotiate with the United States to stop the US from expanding Tachikawa Air Force Base. Socialist Party Secretary-General Asanuma Inejirō pointed out at the time, "If the government does not handle this properly, the government should be held responsible for the disputes caused by the struggle against the base."

Funada Naka rejected the Socialist Party's request. He emphasized that the government's policy of completing the surveying work before October 16th would not be changed. Therefore, the talks between the two sides broke up without result.

    为了给美国扩大基地不惜进攻人民
    日本警察在砂川町造成流血事件
    社会党要求政府停止强制测量遭到拒绝
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本政府今天出动一千二百名警察以强力在砂川町进行测量土地的工作，结果引起大规模冲突，造成有二百六十四人受伤的流血事件。
    日本政府为了扩大砂川町的美国立川空军基地而进行的测量土地工作从10月4日就开始了。由于当地居民的坚决反对，测量工作一直未能正式进行。今天下午三时十五分，日本政府派出大队警察，以装甲车开路，分乘四十辆卡车，来到东京近郊的砂川町。他们在无礼地拖开阻止他们前进的社会党国会议员以后，接着就向由三千名当地居民和前来支援他们的工人和学生组成的纠察线冲去。
    警察的进攻遭到了群众的反抗，于是造成激烈的冲突。冲突持续达一小时。据统计，截至今晚九时，群众方面有一百八十六人受伤，其中十二人受重伤。警察方面也说有七十六名警察受伤。
    警察的暴行已经激起日本社会的公愤。日本社会党的代表在当天下午五时访问了防卫厅长官船田中，要求政府停止强制测量工作。社会党并且要求政府同美国方面进行谈判，使美国停止扩大立川空军基地，社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎当时指出，“如果政府不作妥善处理，由于进行反对基地的斗争而引起的纠纷的责任就应当由政府方面来负。”
    船田中拒绝了社会党的要求。他强调不改变政府要在10月16日以前完成测量工作的方针。因此，双方的会谈无结果而散。
