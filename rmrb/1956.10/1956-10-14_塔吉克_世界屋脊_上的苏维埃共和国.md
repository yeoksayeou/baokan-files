Tajikistan
    —The Soviet Republic on the "Roof of the World"—
    Thirty-two years ago today, on October 14, 1924, the Tajik Soviet Autonomous Republic was established (renamed the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic on December 5, 1929). In the era of Soviet power, backward Tajikistan has been built into a country with advanced industry, collective agriculture, and socialist culture.

    Tajikistan is located in the Pamir Plateau, known as the "Roof of the World," in Central Asia. It borders China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to the east, Afghanistan to the south, and the Soviet republics of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan to the northeast and northwest. It has a territory of 142,000 square kilometers and a population of 1.5 million. The main residents are Tajiks, as well as Russians, Uzbeks, and Kyrgyz. The capital is Stalinabad.

    Tajikistan is a mountainous country, gradually rising from northwest to southeast. Three-quarters of the country's territory is made up of mountains over 4,000 meters high. The highest peaks in the Soviet Union with the largest glaciers are in Tajikistan, such as the Stalin Peak, which reaches 7,495 meters, and the Lenin Peak, which reaches 7,134 meters. The Fedchenko Glacier, which is 77 kilometers long, is the longest glacier in the world.

    During the Tsarist era, Tajikistan was one of the most backward regions. The best arable land and pastures, as well as the entire irrigation system, were the private property of the Emir of Bukhara and local feudal lords, and the people lived in extreme poverty. Agriculture was cultivated using the most primitive methods, and there was practically no industry. Before the revolution, there were only more than two hundred industrial workers. Culture was also backward. Before the revolution, only one in two hundred people was literate, and only 369 people were in school, all children of monks, bureaucrats, and landlords.

    Under the influence of the Russian Revolution, the northern region of Tajikistan established Soviet power in November 1917 and joined the territory of Turkestan. In early September 1920, the Emir of Bukhara's regime was overthrown, and the Bukhara Soviet People's Republic was established. On October 14, 1924, as a result of the territorial division of various nationalities in Central Asia, the Tajik Soviet Socialist Autonomous Republic was established and joined the Uzbek Soviet Republic. On December 5, 1929, it was renamed the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic and became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union.

    In the era of Soviet power, Tajikistan's socialist large-scale industry has grown. The metal processing, cotton ginning, and textile industries in Stalinabad, the silk industry and fruit canning industry in Leninabad, the petroleum industry in Nefteabad, and the coal industry in Shurab are all well developed. In addition, there are oil extraction, food processing, and meat processing industries. Some power stations have also been built on the rivers in the mountains.

    Before the revolution, Tajikistan was a country full of mountains and ravines without roads, but now it has two railways and many highways.

    In agriculture, Tajikistan has built the Fergana Canal and the Gissar Canal, irrigating cotton, rice, mulberry trees, and fruit trees in the basins and lowlands. Sugarcane is planted in the southernmost part, which is the only region in the Soviet Union where sugarcane is sown. Tajikistan's cotton planting industry is very developed. Its total output is second only to Uzbekistan, ranking second in the Soviet Union, while its yield per unit area ranks first in the Soviet Union. The long-staple cotton in the Vaksh Valley is very famous. Wheat and barley are sown in non-irrigated areas. Mountain areas have developed animal husbandry. The Gissar and Karakul sheep are world-renowned.

    Tajikistan now has 2,624 schools, nine institutions of higher learning, and one Academy of Sciences. During the era of Soviet power, about 300 doctors and associate doctors have grown up among Tajikistan's intellectuals.

    During the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, Tajikistan's industry, agriculture, and culture will have greater development. The total industrial output of the republic will increase by about 70% in five years. The construction of the Kayrak-Kum hydroelectric power station on the Syr Darya River and the Perepad hydroelectric power station on the Vakhsh Canal will be completed, and the construction of the Golovnaya hydroelectric power station on the Vakhsh Canal will begin this year. In agriculture, continue to fully develop cotton planting, especially increasing the production of fine-staple cotton. By 1960, the total output of seed cotton should reach one million tons.

    塔吉克
    ——“世界屋脊”上的苏维埃共和国——
    三十二年前的今天，1924年10月14日，塔吉克苏维埃自治共和国成立了（从1929年12月5日起改为塔吉克苏维埃社会主义共和国）。在苏维埃政权的年代里，落后的塔吉克已经建设成为一个拥有先进工业、集体农业和社会主义文化的国家了。
    塔吉克位于中亚细亚号称“世界屋脊”的帕米尔高原上，东面紧靠着我国的新疆维吾尔自治区，南面同阿富汗交界，东北和西北同苏联的吉尔吉斯共和国和乌兹别克共和国交界。领土面积有十四万二千平方公里，人口有一百五十万人。主要居民是塔吉克人，此外还有俄罗斯人、乌兹别克人和吉尔吉斯人。首都是斯大林纳巴德。
    塔吉克是一个山国，从西北向东南逐渐高起。全国四分之三的领土是四千公尺以上的高山。苏联带有最大冰河的最高山峰都在塔吉克，如高达七千四百九十五公尺的斯大林峰和高达七千一百三十四公尺的列宁峰。长达七十七公里的费德琴柯冰河是世界上最长的一条冰河。
    在沙皇时代，塔吉克斯坦是一个最落后的地区。最好的耕地和牧场以及整个灌溉系统，都是布喀剌酋长和当地封建主的私有财产，人民过着最贫苦的生活。农业用最原始的方法耕种，工业等于没有，革命前只有两百多个产业工人。文化也落后，革命前每两百个人才有一个识字的，在学校读书的只有三百六十九个人，都是僧侣、官僚和大地主的子女。
    在俄国革命的影响下，塔吉克的北部地区在1917年11月建立了苏维埃政权，加入土库曼的版图。1920年9月初推翻了布喀剌酋长政权，成立布喀剌苏维埃人民共和国。1924年10月14日中亚细亚各民族领土划分的结果成立了塔吉克苏维埃社会主义自治共和国，加入乌兹别克苏维埃共和国。1929年12月5日改为塔吉克苏维埃社会主义共和国，成为苏联的一个加盟共和国。
    在苏维埃政权年代，塔吉克的社会主义大工业成长起来，斯大林纳巴德的金属加工业、轧棉工业和纺织工业，列宁纳巴德的丝绸工业、水果罐头工业，涅弗帖阿巴德的石油工业、舒拉布的煤炭工业都很发展。此外，还有榨油工业、食品工业和肉类工业。在山中的河流上还建成了一些发电站。
    塔吉克在革命前是一个布满丛山峻岭而没有道路的国家，而现在已经有两条铁路和许多公路了。
    在农业方面，塔吉克已经建成了费尔干大运河和吉沙尔运河，灌溉着盆地和低地的棉花、稻子、桑树和果树。最南部栽种着甘蔗，这是苏联唯一播种甘蔗的地区。塔吉克的植棉业很发达，总产量仅次于乌兹别克，占苏联第二位，而单位面积产量则占苏联第一位。瓦赫什低地的长纤维棉花是很名贵的。在非灌溉地区则播种着小麦和大麦。山地有发达的牧畜业，吉沙尔和卡拉库尔的绵羊是世界闻名的。
    塔吉克现在有二千六百二十四所学校、九所高等学校和一所科学院。在苏维埃政权年代中，塔吉克的知识分子中成长了约三百名博士和副博士。
    在第六个五年计划期间塔吉克的工业、农业和文化还要有更大的发展。五年内共和国的工业总产量约增加70％。要完成锡尔河上的凯拉克—库马水电站和瓦赫什运河上的别列巴德水电站建筑工程，今年并开始建筑瓦赫什运河的果洛夫内水电站。在农业方面继续全力发展植棉业，特别是增产细纤维棉花，到1960年籽棉总产量要达到一百万吨。　（章叶）
