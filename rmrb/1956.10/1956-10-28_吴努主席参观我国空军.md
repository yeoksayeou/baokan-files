Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force unit performed a jet fighter flight demonstration today for Chairman U Nu and the Burmese guests who came to China with him.

    At 10:30 am, a silver aircraft took off from the runway in front of the guests and then flew into the clear, cloudless sky with lightning speed and agility. After making several dives and ascents, it performed stunts such as a downward inverted flight, ascending roll, descending roll, and a vertical "8". Before this aircraft's performance, the pilots also gave the guests a four-plane low-altitude formation flight demonstration.

    After the flight demonstration, Chairman U Nu shook hands with the pilots one by one and thanked them. He said, "Your flying skills are very proficient, and I admire you very much. I wish you success in your flying career." He also said to the person in charge of this air force unit: "I wish you better protect the country's airspace and resist invading enemies."

    This morning, Chairman U Nu and others, accompanied by Lieutenant General Cao Lihuai, Deputy Commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force, visited the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force at an airport near Beijing. Here, the guests were welcomed by officers, pilots, and maintenance personnel of the People's Liberation Army Air Force units lined up. They visited a long line of jet fighters arranged on the airport. Chairman U Nu also entered the cockpit of a Chinese-made jet aircraft to visit, and asked the pilots and maintenance personnel some questions. He happily and humorously pointed to his son standing next to him and said that he hoped he would be a pilot in the future.

    In the afternoon, Madame Nu and some of the personnel accompanying Chairman U Nu on his visit to China visited Jingshan Park, the Beijing Children's Palace, and watched the Chinese color films "Goldfish" and "Magic Brush" at the Children's Palace.

    吴努主席参观我国空军
    新华社27日讯　中国人民解放军空军某部队今天为吴努主席和同他一起来中国访问的缅甸客人们作了喷气歼击机的飞行表演。
    上午十点三十多分，一架银色的飞机从客人们面前的跑道起飞，接着像闪电一般迅速灵活地飞上了万里无云的晴空。在它作了几次俯冲和上升的动作以后，便接连表演了下滑倒转、上升横滚、下滑横滚、立“8”字等特技。在这架飞机表演前，飞行员们还为客人们作了四机低空编队飞行表演。
    飞行表演后，吴努主席同飞行员们一一握手，并向他们致谢。他说：“你们的飞行技术很熟练，我很钦佩你们。祝你们在飞行事业上获得成功。”他还对这个空军部队的负责人说：“祝你们更好地保卫祖国的领空，抵御来犯的敌人。”
    今天上午，吴努主席等由中国人民解放军空军副司令员曹里怀中将等陪同，来到北京附近的一个飞机场参观中国人民解放军空军。在这里，客人们受到了人民解放军空军部队的军官、飞行员和机务人员的列队欢迎。他们参观了排列在机场上的一长列喷气歼击机。吴努主席还进入了一架中国制造的喷气式飞机参观座舱，并且向飞行员和机务人员询问了一些问题。他愉快而有风趣地指着站在他身旁的儿子说，希望他将来要作一个飞行员。
    下午，努夫人和随同吴努主席来中国访问的部分人员游览了景山公园，参观了北京市少年宫，并且在少年宫观看了中国彩色影片“金鱼”和“神笔”。
