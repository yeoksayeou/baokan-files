Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th dispatch: Two thousand residents, workers, and students of Sunagawa Town, Japan, held a mass rally in Sunagawa Town today to celebrate their victory in the struggle against the expansion of the U.S. military's Tachikawa base.

At the meeting, Japan Socialist Party Chairman Suzuki Mosaburo and representatives of labor unions and student groups unanimously celebrated the victory of forcing the government to stop surveying residents' land and expressed their determination to continue the struggle.

The meeting passed a resolution and a declaration. The resolution stated that we must continue to protest to the police authorities, hold them accountable for the violence used by the police against those who defended the land of Sunagawa Town residents on the 12th and 13th, and demand the immediate release of those arrested. The declaration of the meeting pointed out that the Japanese government's force was unable to defeat the unity of those who opposed the expansion of the U.S. military base, who were supported by Japanese public opinion.

Speakers at the meeting pointed out that the residents of Sunagawa Town, by forcing the government to stop the surveying work, have made a good start in further developing the struggle against U.S. military bases throughout Japan. The meeting decided to send propagandists to various U.S. military base areas across the country to call for the launch of a struggle against U.S. military bases.

The Japan Socialist Party's Diet Policy Committee held a meeting today and decided to demand that the Japanese government convene an extraordinary session of the Diet to investigate the responsibility of the government and police authorities for creating the bloody incident in Sunagawa Town. However, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Tanaka expressed his refusal to immediately convene an extraordinary session of the Diet.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: Tokyo message: The Japanese Communist Party announced at a press conference on the 15th that it had sent a telegram to U.S. President Eisenhower protesting the Sunagawa Town incident.

The protest stated that the recent acts of violence by Japanese police in Sunagawa Town were due to the U.S. policy of expanding atomic and hydrogen bomb bases. In addition to the Japanese government, the U.S. government is also responsible for this incident. The Japanese Communist Party, together with the Japanese people, lodges a serious protest with the U.S. government, demanding that it stop expanding all military bases and remove them.

The Japanese Communist Party also announced that it is preparing to launch a movement demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. This treaty allows the United States to maintain military bases in Japan. The Japanese Communist Party also stated that it will cooperate with conservative figures to promote the struggle against military bases. (Attached picture)

    据新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本砂川町居民和工人、学生共二千人今天在砂川町举行了争取反对扩大美军立川基地的斗争胜利的群众大会。
    会上，社会党委员长铃木茂三郎和工会、学生团体的代表在发言中一致庆祝迫使政府停止测量居民土地的胜利，并且表示决心要继续进行斗争。
    大会通过了决议和宣言。决议说，我们要继续向警察当局提出抗议，追究警察在12日和13日向保卫砂川町居民土地的人们施用暴力的责任，并且要求立即释放被捕者。大会宣言指出，日本政府的武力并没有能够战胜受到日本舆论支持的反对扩大美军基地的人们的团结。
    发言者在会上指出，砂川町居民迫使政府停止测量工作，已经作出了使日本全国反对美军基地的斗争进一步发展的良好开端。大会决定派遣宣传员到全国各个美军基地地区去，号召展开反对美军基地的斗争。
    日本社会党的国会对策委员会今天举行会议，决定要求日本政府召开国会临时会议，以追究政府和警察当局在砂川町制造流血事件的责任。但是，内阁官房副长官田中表示拒绝立即召开国会临时会议。
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本共产党15日在记者招待会上宣布，它已经打电报给美国总统艾森豪威尔，对砂川町事件提出抗议。
    抗议说，最近在砂川町发生的日本警察的暴行事件，是由于美国扩大原子弹和氢弹基地政策而发生的。除日本政府外，美国政府对这次事件也有责任。日本共产党同日本人民一起向美国政府提出严重抗议，要求停止扩大一切军事基地，并且撤除军事基地。
    日本共产党还宣布，它已经准备展开一个要求废除美日安全条约的运动。这个条约允许美国在日本保有军事基地。日本共产党同时表示，它要和保守党人士合作推进反对军事基地的斗争。（附图片）
