Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th: Hong Kong News: Chen Yaocai, Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, issued a statement on the Kowloon riots instigated by Kuomintang secret agents on the 28th.

The statement said: "The Kowloon riots that occurred on October 10 were entirely planned and instigated by Kuomintang secret agents in Hong Kong. This is irrefutable evidence, witnessed by the vast majority of the public. The Kuomintang secret agents' heinous and inhuman crimes have caused serious harm to the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon and severely disrupted social order, arousing great public outrage among the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon and condemnation from international public opinion. However, recently, a small number of newspapers with ulterior motives have attempted to cover up the truth, openly using slanderous language such as 'left-wing trade unions caused riots' to frame and smear, reverse right and wrong, and absolve Kuomintang secret agents of their crimes. Recently, even more secret agent thugs have spread rumors, turning falsehoods into truth, in order to achieve their sinister purpose of shifting the blame. Therefore, I hereby solemnly declare as follows:

One, the working compatriots of Hong Kong have always loved peace and demanded a peaceful and stable life and social order. Our trade union's purpose has always been to promote workers' welfare and protect workers' lives and legitimate rights and interests. This has been proven by the consistent actions and facts of all Hong Kong workers and witnessed by the public. We are a legitimate trade union and cannot tolerate any slander or defamation.

Two, regarding the crimes of the Kuomintang secret agents who instigated the Kowloon riots, we have solemnly demanded through legal channels to the Hong Kong authorities that they investigate and punish the ringleaders and ensure the safety of residents' lives and property and social order. Our demand is completely reasonable, and we will firmly continue to demand through legal channels that the Hong Kong government take responsibility to achieve our just goals.

Three, we lodge a solemn accusation against those who confuse the public, incite discord, and spread slanderous remarks and newspapers, as well as secret agent thugs who impersonate names, act recklessly, conspire to shift blame, and have ulterior motives, and demand that the police authorities immediately investigate and stop them."

    港九工会联合会理事长陈耀材就九龙暴乱事件发表声明
    新华社广州29日电　香港消息：港九工会联合会理事长陈耀材28日就国民党特务分子制造的九龙暴乱事件发表一项声明。
    声明说：“10月10日发生的九龙暴乱事件，完全是香港的国民党特务分子所阴谋策动，这已是铁证俱在，为广大社会人士有目共见的事实。这些国民党特务分子丧心病狂，灭绝人性的罪行，造成了对港九同胞的严重祸害和社会秩序的严重破坏，已引起港九同胞的极大公愤和国际舆论的斥责。但近来有少数别有用心的报章却企图一手遮天，公开以所谓‘左派工会制造暴乱’等含血喷人的言词来进行诬蔑，颠倒是非，为国民党特务分子洗脱罪行。最近更有特务暴徒散播流言，以伪为真，以遂其移尸嫁祸的阴谋目的。为此，本人特严正声明如下：
    一、香港工人同胞一贯来爱好和平，要求和平安定的生活和社会秩序，我们工会的宗旨一贯来是兴办工人福利，保障工人生活和合法权益，这是为全港工人历来的行动和事实证明了的，也是社会人士有目共睹的。我们是合法工会，不能容忍任何的毁谤和诬蔑。
    二、对这次国民党特务分子所制造的九龙暴乱的罪行，我们已通过合法途径严正向香港当局提出了追查、惩办元凶祸首，保障居民生命财产和社会秩序的要求，我们这一要求是完全合理的，我们将坚定的继续通过合法途径要求香港政府负起责任来，达到我们正义的目的。
    三、对于那些混淆视听、挑拨中伤的言论和报章及伪冒名义胡作非为，阴谋嫁祸，别有用心的特务暴徒，我们提出严正的指责，而要求警察当局立即予以追查和制止。”
