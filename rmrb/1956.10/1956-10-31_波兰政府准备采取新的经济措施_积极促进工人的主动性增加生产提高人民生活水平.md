Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 29th: According to a Warsaw dispatch from the Polish News Agency on the 29th, the Chairman of the Polish State Economic Planning Commission, Jędrychowski, and the Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Jaroszewicz, spoke to representatives of the Polish News Agency about the current and future plans formulated by the government in the economic sphere, based on the guiding principles of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party. The most important of these measures is assisting workers who propose reform initiatives in the methods of managing enterprises. This is mainly related to the establishment of workers' self-governing bodies and granting greater autonomy to industrial enterprises. A draft resolution of the Council of Ministers on these issues is currently being drafted. These resolutions will soon be studied by a committee established to promote workers' initiative.

Consideration is also being given to reducing the 1957 investment plan in order to have more funds to directly improve people's living standards. In the process of drafting the Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), considerable reductions have already been made in investment expenditures. For example, the guiding principles adopted by the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party stipulated basic construction costs of 318 billion zlotys, while the draft Five-Year Plan law currently being discussed by the parliamentary committees stipulates a total investment in basic construction of 301.5 billion zlotys. This is a very difficult issue, because we must in no way reduce investment to the extent that it will limit the increase in industrial production potential in the coming years, that is to say, not to the extent that it will have an adverse impact on the possibility of increasing production.

One of the most pressing economic tasks facing the government is to find ways to increase the supply of building materials to rural areas. Although much work has been done in this regard this year, the need remains great due to the long-term neglect of this issue in previous years.

The government is also considering finding ways to achieve greater coal savings. This year, in order to ensure an adequate fuel supply for residents, to reduce arrears in coal subsidies and the amount of coal owed to farmers as payment for contracted pig sales, extensive restrictions have been imposed on our coal exports. The situation in the coal industry remains worrying. In order to ensure sufficient fuel and coal supplies for industry and railway transport, while at the same time not further reducing coal exports (because this would have an adverse impact on the import of urgently needed raw materials, equipment, and consumer goods), it is necessary to analyze the coal consumption situation in all sectors once again in order to find more possibilities for reducing coal consumption.

The government has also established a committee responsible for resolving difficulties in the electricity sector.

The economic leadership agencies have instructed the relevant ministries to take measures to significantly increase the quantity and quality of consumer goods next year. The completion of this task will depend not only on light industry and the food industry, but also on many sectors of heavy industry (including a portion of the defense industry) producing items that can meet the needs of residents. This task is a key issue in the policy of raising living standards.

    波兰政府准备采取新的经济措施
    积极促进工人的主动性增加生产提高人民生活水平
    新华社华沙30日电　据波兰通讯社华沙29日报道，波兰国家经济计划委员会主席英德里霍夫斯基和部长会议副主席雅罗谢维奇对波兰通讯社的代表谈到了政府在经济方面根据波兰统一工人党中央委员会第八届全体会议的指导原则所拟定的当前的计划和将来的计划。这些措施中占最重要地位的就是协助在管理企业的方法方面提出改革倡议的工人的问题。这主要是同成立工人自治机构和给予工业企业更大自治权的问题有关。现在正在草拟部长会议关于这些问题的决议草案。这些决议不久即将由为了促进工人的主动性而设立的委员会进行研究。
    现在还在考虑削减1957年的投资计划以便有更多的资金来直接提高人民生活水平的问题。在草拟五年计划（1956—1960年）的过程中，已经对投资费用作了几次相当大的削减，例如，波兰统一工人党中央委员会第七次全体会议所通过的指导原则规定基本建设费用为三千一百八十亿兹罗提，而现在议会各委员会所讨论的五年计划法草案则规定基本建设的投资总额为三千零一十五亿兹罗提。这是一个非常困难的问题，因为我们无论如何不能把投资削减到在今后年代里将会限制工业生产潜力的增加的程度，也就是说不能削减到会对增加生产的可能性发生不利影响的程度。
    政府所面临的最迫切的经济任务之一，是要找出办法来增加对农村的建筑材料的供应。虽然今年在这方面已经做了许多工作，但是，由于过去一些年里对这个问题长期忽视，这方面的需要仍旧很大。
    政府也正在考虑找到更多省煤的可能性的方法问题。今年，为了保证对居民有充分的燃料供应，为了减少煤炭补贴的拖欠额和对农民根据合同交售猪只的报酬中所拖欠的煤炭量，已经对我们的煤炭出口实行了广泛的限制措施。煤炭工业的情况仍旧令人焦虑。为了保证工业和铁路运输有足够的燃料和煤炭的供应，同时又不再进一步减少煤炭的出口
  （因为这将会对急需的原料、设备和消费品的进口发生不利的影响），有必要再一次分析一下一切部门的用煤情况，以便找出减少煤炭消费量的更多的可能性。
    政府还设立了一个负责解决电力方面的困难的委员会。
    经济方面的领导机构给我们有关各部规定了采取措施在明年大大提高消费品的数量和质量的任务。这一任务的完成不仅要依靠轻工业和食品工业，而且还要依靠重工业的许多部门（包括一部分国防工业）生产出能够满足居民需要的物品。这项任务是提高生活水平的政策中的一项关键问题。
