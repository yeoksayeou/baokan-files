	Autumn Outing in the Suburbs of Beijing
	Liubing

	In this crisp autumn weather, it is truly a joy to wander the western suburbs with three or five companions. Driving out of Fuxingmen, passing through "New Beijing," a scene of deep autumn immediately comes into view.

	The characteristic of the suburbs of Beijing in late autumn after agricultural cooperation is not desolation but freshness. The roads are flat and clean. The tall autumn crops such as sorghum and corn on both sides of the road have already been harvested. After cooperation, the land is harvested and cultivated piece by piece, so along the road one cannot see wasteland, withered leaves, or withered grass, but rather neat and even new cultivated land, interspersed with some newly green wheat fields. Some sweet potatoes that have not yet been dug up are still waiting for the first frost to ripen, with their red vines and green leaves.

	The busy farming season is now over, and there are only a few people in the fields tidying up peanuts, and most of them are groups of women. Most of the male labor force has been organized to go out to engage in sideline production, and many cooperatives have therefore increased their income even in the case of natural disasters. It is said that five agricultural cooperatives earned more than 510,000 yuan from sideline production in a month and a half.

	After a short journey, we arrived at Dongran Village Township. From here all the way to the foot of the Western Hills, extending southwards, are mainly vegetable fields. It is said that the western suburbs (Haidian District) have about 45,000 mu of vegetable fields, which are one of the main bases for supplying vegetables to the capital. Beijing's famous Sijiqing Vegetable Production Cooperative is also in Dongran Township. Now cucumbers, eggplants, tomatoes and other vegetables have been harvested, but the uniformly green Chinese cabbage and radishes have grown up, covering large areas of the wilderness with boundless greenery, making the suburbs in late autumn even more vibrant. We stood in the vegetable plots, reluctant to leave.

	This vegetable field belongs to the Guanghui Vegetable Production Cooperative in Dongran Township. At this time, it was the farmers' short rest time after lunch, and the cooperative director and production team leader talked to us enthusiastically. The Guanghui Cooperative was originally just a cooperative with more than 100 households. In the high tide of cooperation last year, it merged with two other cooperatives to form a large cooperative with more than 300 households. The income in the first year after the merger increased greatly. According to the estimate of the pre-distribution plan, each laborer can receive an average of more than 600 yuan for the whole year.

	The cooperative members were overjoyed after their income increased. A cooperative member surnamed Wu, who was with us looking at the vegetables, is the cooperative's statistician and feeder. His family of five earns more than 1,000 yuan. I asked him how his family lived. He said: We have enough to eat and wear, and some pocket money to spend. I asked him if there were still any households in the cooperative with difficulties. He said that if someone temporarily lacks pocket money to buy cooking oil and salt, there are still some; but there are no households whose grain is not enough to eat and whose lives cannot be maintained. He pointed to some bright glass houses among the green and said: People's enthusiasm for production is great. Look, that is the warm room we newly built. The tomatoes on the ground have just been removed from the shelves, and the tomatoes in the warm room are already growing as big as walnuts. This is to prepare for people to eat in winter.

	This year, the cooperative's vegetable fields are densely planted, and each mu of Chinese cabbage will produce at least 2,000 jin more than last year. The production team leader pointed to the vegetable fields that looked like they were densely paved with green jade and said: Look, it's so dense that you can't even see a bit of the ground, but the vegetables are still growing so strong, so big, and so neat. He pointed to the large green radishes and said: Our radishes are already three and a half jin in weight, and they will continue to grow bigger.

	There is also a problem here: The Sijiqing Cooperative, which is closely adjacent to this cooperative, does not have a lower yield than the Guanghui Cooperative, and the yield of some vegetables is even higher than that of this cooperative, but the average income of the members of the Sijiqing Cooperative is not as high as that of this cooperative. We asked the director of the Guanghui Cooperative what the reason was. He smiled and said: The main reason is that the management is timely, and various vegetables are on the market earlier, taking advantage of the good price. Because this cooperative's various vegetables are on the market early, it is also very popular with customers, and it has a close relationship with the vegetable supply station. Before the National Day, the supply station called them to ask if they had "Xiaobaikou" (a type of Chinese cabbage with tender leaves and soft core) to supply. They said yes. The supply station asked them to send it quickly. They sold a lot. These days, "Xiaobaikou" is generally on the market, so there is some backlog. This method is certainly clever, and it is also beneficial to market supply. However, if everyone takes advantage of the early market, it will end up that everyone is not early. It seems that the vegetable supply and marketing departments should contact the various vegetable production cooperatives to try to ensure that consumers can eat various vegetables in a timely manner, so that each production cooperative can increase its income.

	Leaving the vegetable fields, we drove straight up to the Western Hills. The maple leaves have not yet turned red, but there are one or two red leaves on the persimmon trees, set off by the fruitful yellow persimmons and gurgling clear springs, making the scenery of the Western Hills particularly elegant and beautiful. The relevant departments have closed the mountains on both sides to cultivate forests, but looking up, the bare mountains and white grass on both sides still seem to be a bit lacking in beauty. This area is the hillside land of the Xishan Cooperative. The Xishan Cooperative is a top-notch large cooperative with more than 1,880 households. The southern half is a rice and vegetable area with high income, and the northern half is mostly hillside land with low income, which is difficult to balance. It is said that there are plans to plant fruit trees extensively on the northern slopes to increase income. This will add a lot of variety and fragrance for tourists. The Western Hills of the future will be more attractive than today. The lives of the farmers will also be more fulfilling.

    秋游京郊
    流冰
    在这天高气爽的秋天，约三、五同伴漫游西郊，真是一件快事。驱车出复兴门，穿过“新北京”，一派秋深景象，立即映入眼帘。
    农业合作化后的京郊深秋的特色，不是萧索而是清新。条条马路平坦整洁。路两旁高粱、玉米等大秋作物早已收倒。合作化后，地是收一块耕一块，因此沿路竟看不到荒地、枯叶、败草，而是整齐细匀的新耕地，间或有一些刚泛新绿的麦田。有些未曾刨挖的白薯，也还蔓红叶绿地静待初霜来催。
    现时农忙已过，田中只有少许人在收拾花生，而且多是成群结伙的妇女。男劳动力们多已有组织地出外从事副业生产，许多社都因此在受灾的情况下还增加了收入。据说有五个农业社在一个半月内就从副业中收入了五十一万多元。
    行不多时便到了东冉村乡，从这里直到西山脚下，向南一直伸展开去，主要都是菜地。据说西郊（海淀区）有菜地约四万五千多亩，是供给首都蔬菜的主要基地之一。北京有名的四季青蔬菜生产合作社也在这东冉乡。现时黄瓜、茄子、西红柿等菜都已下去，但一色青青的大白菜和萝卜都已生长起来，把大片原野遮掩得碧绿无垠，使深秋的郊外更加生气勃勃。我们伫立菜畦中，舍不得离去。
    这块菜地是东冉乡光辉蔬菜生产合作社的。这时正是农民们午饭后短暂休息的时间，社长和生产队长都热情地和我们谈话。光辉社原先只是一个一百多户的社，去年合作化高潮中，和另外两个社合并成一个三百多户的大社。并社后的第一年收入就大大增加。根据预分方案的估算，全年每个劳动力平均可分到六百多元。
    社员们增加收入以后，个个喜形于色。同我们在一起看菜的有一个姓吴的社员，他是这个社的统计兼饲养员，全家五口人，收入一千多元。我问他家生活怎样。他说：有吃有穿有零钱花。我问他全社中还有没有困难户。他说，如果说一时手头缺少个打油买盐的零花钱的还有；要说粮食不够吃，生活上维持不下来的是没有了。他指着万绿丛中一些明光灿烂的大玻璃房说：人们的生产劲头是大的。你看，那就是我们新筑起来的暖房，地面上的西红柿刚拆架，暖房里的西红柿早又长的像核桃那么大了。这是给人们预备冬天吃的。
    今年这个社菜地采用密植，每亩白菜最少要比去年多产二千多斤。生产队长指着像用绿玉密砌起来的菜田说：你看，这密得连一点地皮都看不见，但这菜还是长了这么壮、这么大、这么整齐。他又指着大青萝卜说：我们的萝卜大的已有三斤半重了，它们还要往大长哩。
    这里还有一个问题：同这个社紧相邻接的四季青社产量并不比光辉社低，有些菜的产量还要比这个社高些，可是四季青社社员们的平均收入却没有这个社多。我们问光辉社社长这道理何在。他笑着说：主要就是因为经营得及时，各种蔬菜都上市得早些，趁了好价钱。由于这个社各种菜上市早，也很受顾主欢迎，和蔬菜供应站联系较密切。国庆节前供应站就打电话问他们有没有“小白口”（一种帮嫩心软的白菜）供应，他们说有。供应站就要他们赶快送。卖了不少。这几天“小白口”普遍上市了，就有些积压。这方法当然是精明的，对市场供应也有好处。不过如果都这样趁早，反会弄得都早都不早，看来应该是由蔬菜供销部门，与各蔬菜生产合作社联系，设法保证消费者能及时吃到各种菜，使各个生产社都能增加收入才好。
    离开菜田，驱车直上西山。枫叶尚未泛红，倒是柿树上有一、二红叶，陪衬着累累黄柿，淙淙清泉，使西山胜景格外显得幽雅美丽。有关方面已在两侧山上封山育林，不过抬头展望，两旁仍显秃山白草，似感美中不足。这一带是西山社的山坡地。西山社是一个一千八百八十多户的头等大社。南半部是稻、菜区，收入多，北半部多是山坡地收入少，很难平衡。听说有在北部山坡上广植果树以增加收入的打算。这样将给游人增加不少花色、果香。将来的西山会比今天更为诱人。农民们的生活也会更为美满的。
