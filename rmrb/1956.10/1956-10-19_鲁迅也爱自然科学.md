Lu Xun Also Loved Natural Science
Zhou Jianren

Lu Xun loved literature and spent most of his life writing and translating literary works, as well as fighting against counter-revolutionary forces. However, he also had a great love for natural science. I mentioned earlier that Lu Xun enjoyed planting flowers in his childhood. The flowers he planted were not necessarily rare and precious; they were often very common or wild flowers and trees. This shows that he truly loved plants. Although loving to plant flowers is not necessarily the same as loving natural science, some botanists in history started from a love of flowers and trees.

After the age of eighteen, Lu Xun went to the Nanjing School of Mines and Railways to study mining. Of course, he had to study courses related to mineralogy, geology, physics, and chemistry, although the school may not have used these names at the time. When he returned, he brought back a box of mineral specimens, including a purple and huge garnet, which was very beautiful. These specimens have long been lost. Later, probably when he was teaching in Hangzhou, he brought back some fossil specimens such as trilobites, which shows that he continued to be interested in this area. These specimens were probably lost when he moved to Beijing in 1919.

After Lu Xun returned from studying abroad, he taught physiology and chemistry at the Hangzhou Normal School. He studied physiology at the Sendai Medical College, and chemistry was a basic course, so he had to study it as well. When he returned to China, he brought back a box of self-made histological specimens, which were called "photos" in Chinese commerce, meaning slides for viewing under a microscope. Later, when he was the supervisor and taught physiology and mineralogy at the Shaoxing Middle School, these slides still existed, but they were later lost as well.

Among the natural sciences, Lu Xun studied botany for the longest time. As mentioned earlier, he loved to plant flowers. When he was over ten years old, he collected "azaleas" and "old buddha" from the mountains to plant. The "old buddha" can be said to be the shortest woody plant, no more than a few inches high, with round fruits that are red when ripe and very cute. He also planted *Pyracantha fortuneana*. He also copied several ancient books about flowers, plants, and trees, which may still exist. While in Japan, he also wrote to me to study botany and sent back books such as "Textbook of Botany" written by Strasburger and others. When he returned to China, he talked about the morphology and life of carnivorous plants he had seen in Japan and was extremely interested in them.

In Hangzhou, although Lu Xun did not teach botany, he collected many plant specimens. In Shaoxing Prefectural Middle School, he did not teach botany either, but he still continued to collect plants. Indeed, he was very interested in botany. Not long ago, a friend in Shanghai wrote to me and told me that he had found two short articles written by Lu Xun from a little-known publication edited by Lu Xun. They were two travel notes, both published under my name. One recorded the living conditions of a *Liparis krameri* growing on the cliffs of Mount Kuaiji. The other recorded the mudskippers (anciently called *Periophthalmus cantonensis*) on the beach in front of the Zhentang Temple. A *Liparis krameri* has only one tender, spoon-shaped leaf per plant, with light purple-red flowers and a long spur, which is very beautiful. He collected it and made a specimen. Later, I mounted most of these plant specimens on cardboard. In the winter of 1919, when I moved to Beijing, I donated these specimens to a school. Plant specimens are very difficult to preserve. Even if they are carefully stored to avoid dust pollution, it is still very difficult to prevent insect infestation and mold. After so many years, they certainly no longer exist.

Lu Xun's love for natural science was preserved until his later years. After he moved to Shanghai, he translated a small book about medicinal plants. Once, I bought a microscope with a magnification of six or seven hundred times from the German company, Ryland, and Lu Xun even wanted to take some time to study microorganisms.

Lu Xun's research on botany was not limited to the records of plant morphology and life, which is a natural path for a country to start doing research in this area. Although Lu Xun also studied classification, after moving to Beijing, on the bookshelf in the adjacent room, in addition to Metchnikoff's "Prolongation of Life," and Hertwig's works on zoology, there were also books on plant taxonomy and atlases of animals and plants. But he also loved theory. As early as when he was studying in Japan, he read Darwin's "On the Origin of Species" and other books. Lu Xun believed that studying biology requires understanding the philosophy of biology. Although he valued theory very much, he also valued facts very much. He strongly opposed drawing conclusions without clarifying the truth, and he also strongly opposed using partial facts to generalize the rest. These two are actually the same thing; exaggerating partial facts is also not clarifying the facts. This is Lu Xun's way of thinking, not only for natural science but also for other aspects.

    鲁迅也爱自然科学
    周建人
    鲁迅是爱好文学的，一生大部分时间用在文学的写作和翻译，及与反革命势力的斗争上，但他也很爱好自然科学。我早先说过，鲁迅幼年时代很爱好种花，他种的不见得是名贵的花卉，往往是很普通的或野生的花木。足见他真正爱好植物。爱种植花卉虽不便是爱好自然科学，但历史上有些植物学者是从爱好花卉、树木开始的。
    鲁迅十八岁后，往南京矿路学堂里去学开矿。当然须学习有关于矿物学、地质学、物理、化学这些功课，可能学校里当时并不用这些名称。他回来时曾经带回来一盒矿物标本，其中有紫色而巨大的石榴石，很美丽。这些标本早已丢失了。后来大概在杭州教书的时候罢，又带回一些三叶虫等化石标本，可见他对于这方面还继续有兴趣。这些标本大概是1919年搬家往北京时失去的。
    鲁迅留学回来后，在杭州两级师范学堂里教生理学及化学。生理学是仙台医学专门学校里学医的时候学习的，化学是基础课，当然也要学习。他回国时曾带回一盒自制的组织学标本，中国商业上叫它们为“照片”，意思是放在显微镜下照看用的片子。接着，他在绍兴中学堂里当监学时兼教生理学、矿物学等等功课时这些片子还存在，但后来也失去了。
    自然科学中鲁迅学习得最长久的要推植物学。前已说到他爱种花，十余岁时曾向山中采“映山红”、“老勿大”等来种植。老勿大可以说是木本植物中最短小的植物，高不过数寸，果实圆形，熟时赤红色，很可爱。虎刺也种过。他并且抄过好几种讲花草、树木的古书，现在可能还存在。在日本时候，还曾写信叫我学习植物学，并寄回德人Strasburger等四人合写的植物学等书籍。回国时，他讲起在日本看到的食虫植物的形态和生活，对它们极有兴趣。
    在杭州时，鲁迅虽不教植物学，但采集了不少植物标本。在绍兴府中学堂里也不教植物学，但仍然继续采集植物。的确，他对于植物学是很有兴趣的。不久以前，上海一位朋友来信告诉我，说他从一种鲁迅编辑的、很少人知道的刊物上找到两篇鲁迅写的短文，是两篇游记，都是用我的名字发表的。一篇上记着生在会稽山的岩壁上的一叶兰的生活状况。又一篇记着镇塘殿前面海滨沙滩上的跳鱼（古称弹涂）。一叶兰一株只一片调羹形的柔嫩的叶片，花淡紫红色，有长距，很美丽。他采集下来，做了标本。后来我把这些植物标本的大部分装上台纸。1919年冬天，搬家往北京时，把这些标本赠送给一个学校。植物标本保存很不易，即使保藏得尚密，不致被尘土污染，但避免虫蛀、发霉还是很不容易的。今已年久，当然已不存在了。
    鲁迅爱好自然科学的心直到晚年还保存着。他搬到上海住下来以后，还曾翻译过一本讲药用植物的小书。有一次，我向德商赖兰公司买了一台六、七百倍的显微镜，鲁迅还想抽出一些时间来研究微小的生物。
    鲁迅研究植物学并不拘束于植物形态生活的记载，这是一个国家开始做这方面的研究工作的当然途径。鲁迅虽亦研究分类，搬家到北京以后，寝室间壁的书架上，除却久在法国工作的俄人梅契聂科夫的“长寿论”，德人阿·海尔脱维恩的动物学方面的著作等等之外，还有植物分类学书籍及动植物图谱等书。但他又爱好理论，早在日本留学时，便看达尔文的物种起源等书。鲁迅认为研究生物学是必须懂得生物哲学的。他虽然十分看重理论，可是又十分看重事实。他很反对没有把事实真相搞清便下断语，也很反对拿片面的事实去推概其余。这二者其实是一件事情，把事实片面夸大也就是没有把事实弄清楚。这是鲁迅的思想方法，不仅对于自然科学，对于其他方面，也是这样。
