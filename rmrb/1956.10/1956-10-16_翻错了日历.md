    Flipped the Calendar Wrong
    Gu Sifan
    Twenty years ago, echoing our "December 9th" National Salvation Movement, Egypt broke out in a nationwide anti-imperialist demonstration. In Cairo, with Al-Azhar University as the core, students united people from all walks of life and launched a fierce and bloody struggle against British imperialism and the reactionary Nahas Pasha cabinet. At that time, I saw these news reports in the newspaper and deeply felt that we shared a common destiny with the Egyptian people. Unable to suppress the excitement in my heart, I drew material from the Egyptian patriotic movement and wrote a novel entitled "The Restless City." A few days ago, wanting to write something about Egypt, I re-read this novel, and there was a passage like this:
    "At midnight, a rare giant storm blew in from the Sahara Desert, the moon dimmed, and the pyramids and Sphinx were submerged in the plains. The Red Sea stirred up rare angry waves. Transport ships loaded with Italian soldiers returning defeated from the Udala front, French gunboats heading to Syria to suppress the anti-imperialist riots in Damascus, and second-class cruisers flying the English flag, all sailed against this angry wave. The waves grew fiercer and fiercer, and the searchlights timidly peered at the sea surface, and the warning sirens wailed. Italian soldiers lay groaning on the deck, French sailors vomited Saigon wine and fruit against the railings, and Anglo-Saxon sailors also pulled ropes in panic. Although they were on different warships and spoke different languages, they were facing the same dangerous waves and threatened by the same suspicion:
    "All the oppressed people are about to rise up!"
    "That wind, that wave, that warning siren, all symbolize and hint that such a day will come..."
    Twenty years have passed, and history has not disappointed our expectations. Mussolini, who slaughtered the people of Ethiopia, was long ago hanged on the gallows; Syria, after years of bloody struggle, broke free from the shackles of colonialism; and Egypt also washed away seventy-four years of shame. On June 13th of this year, the last British soldier was permanently driven out of the land along the Suez Canal. The twentieth century is the century of the people, and the fate of colonialism is destined to be like Wang Xiaoer's New Year, getting worse every year. A few days ago, President Sukarno's words at the welcoming rally in Beijing were very interesting: "Colonialism cannot but die, and the death of colonialism is a law of natural development. No one can keep colonialism from dying. Only those who can stop the sun and moon from rotating can keep colonialism from dying, and the moon and sun are constantly rotating, so we should be certain that one day, colonialism will all die..."
    But there are those who hope to reverse the universe and stop the sun and moon from rotating. Look! After Egypt proposed the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, the gentlemen at 10 Downing Street, how furious they were! Despite sitting on the "Governor-General of the Colonies" throne for many years, even if it has long been chopped up to build a toilet, even though they are old and decrepit and have been reduced to poor relatives relying on others, they cannot let go of the arrogant airs of the "master." They always find the independence demands of the Asian and African people to be an eyesore. Prime Minister Eden is aggressively deploying troops and making the shameless statement:
    "British troops should reoccupy the Suez Canal Zone!"
    It looks like history is going back to 1882, and the British Empire fleet will relive the old dream of bombarding Alexandria? As if the broken planks used to build the toilet, with a few nails hammered in and a fresh coat of paint, can still be transformed into a magnificent throne?
    The wheels of history will not turn backwards; Prime Minister, you have flipped the calendar wrong!

    翻错了日历
    谷斯范
    二十年前，跟我国的“一二九”救亡运动遥相辉映，埃及爆发了全国性的反帝示威运动。开罗城里，以爱资哈尔大学为核心，学生们团结各阶层群众，向英帝国主义和反动的那哈士·巴沙内阁，展开了酷烈的流血斗争。当时，我从报上看到这些消息，深感我们与埃及人民命运相共，抑制不住内心的激动，取材埃及的爱国运动，写过一篇题为“不宁静的城”的小说。前几天，想写些关于埃及的东西，重读了这篇小说，有一段是这样的：
    “到午夜，从撤哈拉沙漠吹来了罕有的巨飚，月亮暗淡了，金字塔和斯芬克狮隐没在平原里。红海激起了罕有的怒浪，满载着从乌达拉战线败绩归来的意大利士兵的运输舰，往叙利亚弹压大马士革反帝暴动的法国炮舰，和飘着英吉利旗的二等巡洋舰，全都迎着这怒浪航行着。浪越来越凶，探海灯畏缩地在海面上窥视，告警的汽笛呜呜地在哭。意大利士兵卧在甲板上呻吟，法国水手傍着栏杆呕吐着西贡的酒和果子，盎格罗·萨克逊人的水手，也惊惶地拉着绳索。他们虽然乘着不同的军舰，操着不同的语言，但是临在同一的危浪里，被同一的猜想所威胁：
    “一切被压迫的人们都要起来了！”
    “那风，那浪，那告警的汽笛，都在象征、暗示那样的日子会到来。……”
    二十年过去了，历史没有辜负我们的期望。屠杀埃塞俄比亚人民的墨索里尼，早被吊死在绞架上；叙利亚经多年的流血斗争，挣脱了殖民地的锁枷；埃及也清洗了七十四年的耻辱，今年6月13日，最后一个英国士兵从苏伊士运河边的土地上被永远逐走。二十世纪是人民的世纪，殖民主义的命运注定如王小二过年，一年不如一年。几天前，苏加诺总统在北京各界欢迎会上所说的话很有意思：“殖民主义不能不死亡，殖民主义的死亡是自然发展的规律。没有一个人能够保住殖民主义不死亡。只有能阻止太阳和月亮运转的人，才能保住殖民主义不死亡，而月亮和太阳是运转不息的，所以我们应该确信，总有一天，殖民主义必将全部死亡……”
    但巴望旋转乾坤、阻止太阳和月亮运转的人不是没有。瞧！埃及提出苏伊士运河公司国有化后，唐宁街官邸的绅士们，那种暴跳如雷的神气！尽管稳坐多年的“殖民地总督”宝座，早砍掉盖了厕所，尽管自己已青春老去，沦为仰人鼻息的穷亲戚，“主子”的臭架子却放不下，对亚非人民的独立要求，总是看来刺眼。艾登首相气势汹汹地调兵遣将，大言不惭地说：
    “英军应重占苏伊士运河区！”
    看模样，好像历史又回到1882年，不列颠帝国舰队将重温炮轰亚历山大港的旧梦？好像盖厕所的破木板，敲几枚钉子，油漆一新，还能变为金碧辉煌的宝座？
    历史的车轮不会向后转；首相阁下，你翻错了日历！
