Xinhua News Agency, October 1st: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation's Notice to Women's Federations at All Levels Regarding Women's Federation Cadres Studying and Publicizing the Various Documents of the "Eighth National Congress"
To the Women's Federations of all provinces, cities, special districts, and counties, the Chinese Women's Association, the National Association of the Young Women's Christian Association of China, and the National Association of the Women's Temperance Society of China:

The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China has successfully concluded. All the documents of the congress summarize the rich experiences since the Seventh National Congress of the Party and put forward the great task of uniting all forces that can be united at home and abroad to strive to build a socialist motherland. This is the program for the common struggle of all the people of our country. The All-China Democratic Women's Federation warmly supports and will resolutely implement it in its practical work.

In the three reports submitted to the Congress by the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC and the speeches of some representatives, great importance was attached to the active role of the broad masses of women and women cadres in various revolutionary periods and socialist construction undertakings. They expressed concern for the unique difficulties of the masses of women and women cadres and put forward valuable instructions and opinions on continuing to mobilize the active factors of the masses of women and women cadres to build a socialist motherland and strive for the complete liberation of women.

Women's federation cadres at all levels must, under the unified leadership of the local Party committees, conscientiously organize the study and research of the various reports and resolutions of the "Eighth National Congress," as well as important speeches and speeches related to women, and combine them with the inspection and summary of our work to further overcome the subjective and bureaucratic work style, show more concern for the suffering of the masses of women, truly go deep into the masses and reality, and earnestly implement the reports and resolutions of the Congress in women's work and do a solid job.

At the same time, among the masses of women, all opportunities should be used to widely publicize the current tasks and policies proposed by the Congress, the grand scale planned in the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, and the Party's concern for the broad masses of women, to further inspire the enthusiasm and creativity of hundreds of millions of women and further unite them with the people of the whole country to build our country into a great socialist country and strive for the complete liberation of women themselves.

Regarding the time and methods for carrying out this study and publicity work, please follow the unified arrangements of the local Party committee and determine them according to the specific circumstances of your work. However, it must be noted that women's organizations are the broadest mass organizations, and both cadres and the masses include women of all nationalities, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, and various religious beliefs. Therefore, the arrangement of study or publicity work for them should be based on the principle of voluntariness and pay close attention to their level of awareness; adopt a variety of more flexible methods, and strive to adapt to their different situations and meet their active requirements for studying the documents of the "Eighth National Congress."

We hope that you will report to us in a timely manner on the progress of your study and publicity work.
All-China Democratic Women's Federation
