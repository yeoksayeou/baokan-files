    Opinions on the Reform of Traditional Chinese Medicine
    The Xin Hua Xin Chinese Medicine Factory, a joint state-private enterprise in Hengyang City, produces and sells all traditional Chinese medicines in the form of tinctures, tablets, and powders. While these new medicines are indeed more convenient to use than traditional Chinese medicine decoctions, traditional Chinese medicine doctors and patients generally report that their medical effects are poor and they cannot cure diseases. Recently, I suffered from a sore throat. After taking two doses of the new Chinese medicine, my throat pain became even more severe. Later, I bought traditional Chinese medicine decoctions according to the original prescription and took them. My illness was cured in less than two days.
    I am not against changing the dosage forms of traditional Chinese medicine, but I have opinions on this kind of simplified, subjectivist reform of Chinese medicine. The efficacy of the same medicinal herb varies depending on whether it is fresh or aged, and the preparation methods also differ. Using different types of water for washing and decocting also affects its efficacy. However, in the manufacturing of these so-called new Chinese medicines, alcohol evaporation is generally used, which not only changes the properties of the medicine but also limits its shelf life. For example, medicines such as Rehmannia glutinosa and pollen deteriorate quickly and easily lose their efficacy after being evaporated with alcohol. At the same time, the manufacturing process of these new Chinese medicines lacks precise scientific testing, clinical trials, pharmacological experiments, botanical identification, etc. In particular, the clinical trial process is insufficient, the curative effect is generally unclear, and promotion and application are also very dangerous.
    I hope the local health department will pay attention to this issue. Li Duan

### 对改制中药的意见

    对改制中药的意见
    衡阳市公私合营新华新中药制造厂把所有的中药制成酊剂、片剂和粉剂出售。这种新药用起来确实比中药饮片方便，但是中医师和病人普遍反映医疗效果差，治不好病。最近我患过一次喉痛病，吃了两剂新中药，结果喉痛得更厉害。后来我照原处方买了中药饮片煎服，不到两天病就好了。
    我不反对中药改变剂型，但是对于这种简单化的主观主义的改制的中药有意见。同一味药用时分鲜、陈，泡制也有不同的方法，用各种不同的水进行漂洗和煎服，它的效用也就有所不同。可是这种所谓新中药在制造的时候，一般都是用酒精蒸发，不仅改变了药的性能，而且保存时间有限，如地黄、花粉等药品用酒蒸发后，变质很快，极易失去效用。同时，这种新中药在制造过程中缺乏精确的科学化验、临床试用，药理试验、植物鉴定等等，特别是临床试用过程做得不够，疗效一般不明，推广应用也是很危险的。
    希望当地卫生部门注意这个问题。　李端
