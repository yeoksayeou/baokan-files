    International Snippets

    Such a "Rat Eradication Campaign"
    Recently, rats have been rampant in Baguio, Philippines. The municipal authorities launched a "rat eradication campaign," stipulating that municipal staff must hand in five rat tails each month, otherwise they will not receive their salaries. As a result, several municipal staff members who were working normally did not receive their salaries in September because they were unable to hand in five rat tails.

      Novel Advertisement for Applicants
    A manufacturer of electric shavers in New York has posted a novel advertisement for applicants, recruiting young men with beards. The conditions are that the man must be over 21 years old, have a beard that has grown for more than three months, and be willing to have his beard shaved publicly on commercial television.

    "Suicide Prevention" Association
    Recently, an association called "Suicide Prevention" was organized in West Berlin. This association has telephones installed, and anyone who wants to commit suicide can dial a number day or night, and the handler will talk to him and persuade him to find another way out. In the capitalist world, these types of organizations are becoming more and more numerous. It is said that there are such organizations in London, Stockholm, Chicago, Vienna, and other places, which shows that the number of suicides is also increasing.

    Military Uniforms No Longer Popular
    Recently, the West German "Imnit Institute" conducted a public opinion poll, asking respondents whether they preferred to see people in military uniforms or civilian clothes. The survey results showed that 73% of West Germans preferred to see people in civilian clothes rather than in military uniforms. A West German government official said: "Some people who have painful memories of the last disastrous war simply don't like to see soldiers in public places anymore." People in military uniforms are becoming increasingly unpopular in West Germany. (Attached picture)

    国际点滴
    如此“灭鼠运动”
    最近，菲律宾碧瑶老鼠猖獗，市政当局发动了一个“灭鼠运动”，规定市政工作人员每人每月交出五条鼠尾，否则将得不到他们的薪金。结果，有好些个正常工作的市政工作人员在9月份没有领到薪金，因为他们没有能够交出五条老鼠尾巴。
      新奇的征求启事
    纽约有个制造电动须刨的厂商登了一个新奇的征求启事，招收有胡子的青年。条件是年在二十一岁以上的男子，胡子要长三个月以上，同时愿意在商业电视台上把胡子当众剃掉。
    “防止自杀”协会
    最近，西柏林组织了一个名叫“防止自杀”的协会，这个协会里装有电话，凡是想自杀的人，无论昼夜，只要一拨电话，办事人就会同他谈话，劝他另寻出路。在资本主义世界，这类组织越来越多了。据说，在伦敦、斯德哥尔摩、芝加哥、维也纳等地都有，可见自杀者也在越来越多。
    军服不再吃香
    最近西德“伊姆尼特学会”举行了一次民意测验，问被测验者喜欢看见穿军服的人还是穿平民服的人。测验结果表明：西德人有73％宁愿看见穿平民服装的人而不愿看见穿军服的人。西德一个政府官员说：“一些对上次的灾难性战争有着辛酸的回忆的人，就是不喜欢在公共场所再看到军人”。穿军服的人在西德愈来愈不吃香了。（附图片）
