    "Sino-Japanese Friendly Cooperation Will Surely Be Realized"
    —Notes on a Conversation with Eiichi Shukutani, Head of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition Group
    By our reporters Pei Da and Hu Ping
      "Japan has the power to establish normal relations with its neighbors, and Sino-Japanese friendly cooperation will surely be realized." This is what Eiichi Shukutani, the head of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition Group, told us on the 25th. His words left us with a very deep impression.
    The Japanese Commodity Exhibition brought the friendship of all circles in Japan to the Chinese people, and the Chinese people welcomed its exhibition with a friendly and excited mood. The desire of the people of China and Japan for friendly cooperation is more closely linked together through the Japanese Commodity Exhibition. In this pleasant atmosphere, Eiichi Shukutani introduced us to the preparations for the Japanese Commodity Exhibition:
    In May 1955, representatives of China and Japan signed the Third Trade Agreement in Japan, stipulating that both sides would hold commodity exhibitions. In October and December of the same year, the Chinese Commodity Exhibition was exhibited in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan, and achieved great success. All circles in Japan have made great efforts for more than a year to prepare for this Japanese Commodity Exhibition. The Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade and the Japanese Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade have played an active role. But mainly, the Japanese business community is very interested in Japan-China trade. They are not only willing to exhibit commodities, but also voluntarily bear the exhibition costs.
    In order to enable the exhibition to be successfully exhibited abroad, Japanese Diet members and local councilors launched a campaign to request the Japanese government to allocate subsidies. In May of this year, the Japanese Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade formulated a resolution: Japan-China trade must be developed, the "embargo" must be lifted, and both China and Japan must agree to set up commercial representative offices. This motion was unanimously passed by the Japanese House of Representatives. The Japan Local Councilors' League also made the same decision at a conference in Tokyo and made a request to the Japanese government. In mid-May, the Japanese government's cabinet meeting decided to allow the exhibition of some "embargoed" commodities in China, and promised to subsidize 20% of the exhibition costs. Under this situation, the enthusiasm of the business community in Tokyo, Osaka and other places to participate in the exhibition has increased.
    In the spring of this year, Eiichi Shukutani came to China to discuss the location and date of the exhibition and other issues, and received great help from the Chinese side. He expressed his heartfelt thanks for this. After returning to China, he carried out intensive work for the exhibition. However, he expressed regret that some large Japanese manufacturers failed to participate in the exhibition. Eiichi Shukutani said that large Japanese manufacturers are responsible for the production of so-called "embargoed" materials. What they are worried about is their relationship with foreign countries, not that they do not want to trade with China. He pointed out that without the "embargo," the scale of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition would be much larger than it is now.
    When mentioning the hopes of the Japanese business community for this exhibition, Eiichi Shukutani said that they all hope to introduce the situation of Japanese industrial production to the Chinese people through the commodity exhibition, so that Japan-China trade can be further developed and promote friendly cooperation between China and Japan. He emphasized that the wishes of the Japanese business community are sincere. At this time, he took out a bottle of "Mount Manshou" green plum wine. He said that there are also double-wheeled double-share plows and "Temple of Heaven" brand rayon on display in the venue. These brands have never existed in the Japanese market, and Japan does not use this kind of agricultural tools. These are specially manufactured to suit the situation in China.
    Since the Japanese Commodity Exhibition has been exhibited in Beijing for twenty days, more than one million visitors have visited it. Eiichi Shukutani was particularly happy when talking about this. He said: "On the first day of our opening, Chairman Mao Zedong came to visit, and later Premier Zhou Enlai, Chairman Liu Shaoqi and many other government leaders came to visit. Although our exhibits cannot represent the entire situation of Japanese industry, they all watched very carefully. This shows China's concern for the development of Sino-Japanese trade." He said: "Because of this, our exhibition can be so successful. Your country's kindness to us is understood by our people." He pointed out that Japanese newspapers and the Japan Broadcasting Corporation have daily reports on the exhibition. This has had a great impact on the broad masses of the Japanese people and on the Japanese government. He believes that the exhibition plays an important role not only in promoting trade, but also in communicating the feelings of the people of China and Japan.
    Eiichi Shukutani talked about an important experience he gained in this exhibition work: in the future, in Sino-Japanese trade, it is necessary to supply good quality commodities at appropriate prices. Chinese customers not only consider the price, but more importantly, consider the quality of the goods. He believes that the Japanese business community should make a covenant, "not to export shoddy goods to China."
    We raised the question of how to further develop Sino-Japanese trade. Eiichi Shukutani believes that this is the most important of all questions, and then talked about some of his opinions. He believes that the most important thing at present is: Japan should supply China with a large number of good quality products that meet China's needs, and at the same time import industrial raw materials, mineral products and handicrafts from China. To achieve this, Japan must create politically the conditions to do so, and Japanese manufacturers should also learn more about China's needs in order to improve the products exported to China. He hopes that the Chinese people can make more criticisms and suggestions to them in this regard.
    When talking about the current trade situation between the two countries, he hoped that large Japanese enterprises could trade directly with China—for example, steel companies could sell products directly to China and purchase ore from China at the same time. He said that although large Japanese enterprises are subject to artificial obstacles that make them afraid to do so—they fear that this will affect orders with other countries, they are willing to trade with China. He pointed out that in this exhibition, more than a dozen large enterprises actually participated in the exhibition, but the exhibits were not their representative commodities, and were exhibited in the name of trading companies. However, some of the exhibits were distinctive machines produced by those factories.
    In order to develop Sino-Japanese trade, Eiichi Shukutani believes that the establishment of trade representative offices and the development of technical exchanges between the two countries are important issues at present. He said, "We who do practical work feel that it is necessary to set up commercial representative offices and technical exchange stations, so that both parties can easily understand each other's situation and solve problems in a timely manner." The joint statement issued by the Sino-Japanese trade groups in Beijing a few days ago reiterated the issue of establishing trade representative offices with each other. Eiichi Shukutani believes that there are two reasons that are currently hindering the solution of this problem. A major reason is Japan's international situation, which is affected by diplomacy. Another minor reason is the legal problem in Japan. However, he said: "The majority of people in the political and economic circles in Japan hope to expand Sino-Japanese trade, so this problem will definitely be solved in the near future."
    Eiichi Shukutani suggested that China and Japan should set up technical exchange stations in each other's countries to promote mutual technical exchanges. He said: The people of China and Japan are very skillful. Exchanging technology will not only help develop trade, but also help improve the production technology of the people of the two countries. In this exhibition work, some Chinese workers and technicians quickly learned the technology of operating Japanese machines and televisions; China also has many unique technologies that are of interest to the Japanese people.
    Finally, Eiichi Shukutani said that he hopes that China and Japan can hold commodity exhibitions in more places to more widely enhance mutual understanding between the people of the two countries. He said: "According to the current situation, due to the impact of this exhibition, the call for developing Sino-Japanese trade will become more and more popular in Japan, and the Japanese government will have to move in the right direction. The success of this exhibition is a good material for us to persuade government personnel. The recent success of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations is of great significance. It makes the whole world understand that Japan has the power to independently establish diplomatic relations with other countries. The call for the establishment of normal relations between China and Japan will also become more and more popular. We should strive for the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. The future of Sino-Japanese relations is as bright as the rising sun."
    At the end of the conversation, Mr. Eiichi Shukutani stood up excitedly and said: "This exhibition will be the beginning of a new Japan striving to make friends with China."

    “中日友好合作一定能实现”
    ——记日本商品展览团团长宿谷荣一的谈话
    本报记者　裴达　胡平
      “日本有力量同自己的邻国建立正常关系，中日友好合作一定能实现。”这是日本商品展览团团长宿谷荣一在25日对我们说的话。他这番话给了我们极深刻的印象。
    日本商品展览会带来了日本各界对中国人民的友谊，中国人民以友好和兴奋的心情迎接了它的展出。中日两国人民要求友好合作的心情，通过日本商品展览会更紧密地连在一起了。在这愉快的气氛中，宿谷荣一向我们介绍了日本商品展览会的筹备经过：
    1955年5月，中日双方代表在日本签订了第三次贸易协定，规定双方要举办商品展览会。当年10月和12月，中国商品展览会先后在日本东京、大阪展出，取得了很大的成绩。日本各界为筹备这次日本商品展览会，一年多来曾作了很大的努力。日本国际贸易促进协会、日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟更起了积极的作用。但主要是日本工商界对日中贸易感到莫大兴趣，他们不仅愿意展出商品，而且自愿地负担展出费用。
    为使展览会顺利地出国展出，日本国会议员和地方议员，曾经展开一个要求日本政府拨发补助费的运动。今年5月间，日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟拟定了一项决议案：必须发展日中贸易，必须解除“禁运”，同意中日双方互设商务代表机构。这项议案在日本众议院一致通过了。日本地方议员联盟在东京开大会的时候，也作出了同样的决定，向日本政府提出了要求。5月中旬，日本政府的内阁会议作出决定，允许在中国展出一部分“禁运”商品，并且答应给展览会补助20％的展出费用。在这种情况下，东京、大阪等地工商界参加展览会的情绪更加高涨了。
    今年春天，宿谷荣一来中国商谈展出地址和日期等问题，得到中国方面的大力帮助。对此，他表示衷心的感谢。回国以后，他为展览会进行了紧张的工作。但是，他对日本某些大厂商未能参加展览会表示遗憾。宿谷荣一说，日本大厂商担负着所谓“禁运”物资的生产，他们顾虑的是同外国的关系，倒不是他们不想同中国进行贸易。他指出，如果没有“禁运”，日本商品展览会的规模会比现在的大得多。
    提到日本工商界对这次展览会的希望时，宿谷荣一说，他们都希望通过商品展览会把日本工业生产情况介绍给中国人民，使日中贸易进一步发展起来，促进日中两国的友好合作。他强调指出，日本工商界的心愿是真诚的。这时，他拿出一瓶“万寿山牌”青梅酒来。他说，在会场里还摆着有双轮双铧犁和“天坛牌”的人造丝。这些牌号在日本市场上是没有过的，日本也不使用这种农具。这都是为了适合中国的情况而特别制造的。
    日本商品展览会在北京展出二十天以来，参观者达到了一百多万人。宿谷荣一在谈到这点时特别表现高兴。他说：“我们开幕的第一天，毛泽东主席来参观了，后来周恩来总理、刘少奇委员长和其他许多政府首长都来参观了。虽然我们的展品并不能表示日本工业的全部情况，但他们都看得很仔细。这表示了中国对于发展中日贸易的关心。”他说：“就因为这，我们的展览会才能做到这样的成功。贵国对我们这样的厚意，我国人民是了解的。”他指出，日本各报和日本广播协会每天都有关于展览会情况的报道。这在日本广大人民中，以及对日本政府都起了很大的影响。他认为，展览会不但在促进贸易方面，而且在沟通中日两国人民的感情方面也有重大的作用。
    宿谷荣一谈到了他在这次展览工作中取得的一个重要经验：以后在中日贸易上一定要用适宜的价格供应质量好的商品。中国顾客不只考虑价钱的贵贱，而更重要的是考虑商品的质量。他认为日本工商界应订一个公约，“不能向中国出口粗制滥造的商品”。
    我们提出了怎样才能进一步发展中日贸易的问题。宿谷荣一认为这是所有问题当中最重要的一个问题，然后就谈到了他的一些意见。他认为目前最要紧的是：日本要把质量好的适合中国需要的产品大量供应中国，同时从中国输入工业原料、矿产品及手工艺品。而要做到这一点，日本必须在政治上造成能够这样做的条件，日本厂商也应多多了解中国需要的情况，以改进向中国出口的产品，他希望中国人民在这方面能向他们多多提出批评和意见。
    谈到两国间目前的贸易状况时，他希望日本的大企业能够和中国直接贸易——例如钢铁公司直接把产品卖给中国，同时从中国采购矿砂。他说，日本的大企业虽然受到人为的障碍使它们不敢这样做——他们害怕这会影响同别的国家的订货，但是，他们是愿意同中国进行贸易的。他指出，在这次展览会中，有十几家大企业实际上参加了展出，可是展出的不是它们的代表性商品，并且是用贸易商的名义展出的。但展品中也有一部分是那些工厂出产的有特点的机器。
    为了发展中日贸易，宿谷荣一认为两国互设贸易代表机构和开展技术交流是目前重要的问题。他说，“我们做实际工作的，都感到有必要设立商务代表机构和设立技术交流站，使双方都便于了解对方的情况，及时解决问题。”前几天中日两国贸易团体在北京发表的联合声明，重申了关于互相设立贸易代表机构的问题。宿谷荣一认为，目前阻碍这个问题的解决的有两个原因，一个大的原因是日本的国际处境，受到外交上的影响。另一个次要的原因是日本国内的法律问题。但是，他说：“在日本的政治界和经济界的大多数人，都希望扩大中日贸易，因此，这个问题在不久的将来一定能解决的。”
    宿谷荣一建议中日两国在对方互设技术交流站，以促进相互的技术交流。他说：中日两国人民的手都是很灵巧的，交流技术不但有助于发展贸易，也有利于提高两国人民的生产技术。在这次展览工作中，就有一些中国工人和技术人员很快就学到了操纵日本机器和电视机的技术；中国也有很多特有的技术为日本人民所感到兴趣。
    最后，宿谷荣一表示他希望中日两国能够相互在更多的地方举行商品展览会，以便更广泛地增进两国人民的相互了解。他说：“按照现在的局面来说，由于这次展览会的影响，日本国内舆论要求发展中日贸易的呼声将更加高涨起来，日本政府不能不向正确的方向走。这次展览会的成功，是我们说服政府人员的好材料。最近苏日谈判的成功，意义很大，这是使全世界都明白：日本是有力量可以独立地同别的国家建立外交关系的。要求中日两国建立正常关系的呼声，也一定会高涨起来。我们应当努力为中日国交正常化而努力。中日两国关系的前途，如同旭日初升一样明朗。”
    在谈话结束的时候，宿谷荣一先生站起身来兴奋地说：“这次展览会，将作为新的日本争取和中国做朋友的开始。”
