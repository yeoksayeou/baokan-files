Xinhua News Agency report: Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's newly established 1.07 million mu of forage base has begun harvesting. Due to favorable rainfall, fodder crops such as oats, naked oats, and beans are growing well and a bumper harvest is expected. According to estimates by the Autonomous Region's Animal Husbandry Department, the total harvest will reach 90,071,000 jin, marking Inner Mongolia's first record of large-scale fodder production.

The fodder bases are distributed in the grasslands and agricultural areas of eight leagues and two administrative districts, and are managed by agricultural producers' cooperatives and animal husbandry mutual aid cooperative organizations. In the past, the agricultural and pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, which have millions of livestock, often suffered losses of large numbers of cattle and sheep in winter due to insufficient fodder.

    内蒙古大量收获饲料作物
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区今年新建立的一百零七万亩饲料基地，已开始收割。由于雨水调和，燕麦、莜麦、豆类等饲料作物生长良好，可获丰收。据自治区畜牧厅估计，全区收获量将达到九千零七十一万斤，这是内蒙古历史上第一次大量生产饲料的记录。
    饲料基地分布在八个盟，两个行政区的草原和农业区，由农业生产合作社和畜牧业互助合作组织经营。内蒙古拥有千百万头牲畜的农牧区，过去因为饲料不足，常使大群牛羊在冬季受到损失。
