    Should Not Occupy Commune Members' Houses as Pigsties

    We investigated the collective pig raising situation in the Houluo, Yongyi, Shanfu, and Nancun advanced cooperatives in Xiangtan County, and found that in order to solve the problem of pigsties, they occupied a large number of civilian houses. The four cooperatives relocated a total of sixty-six households. In order to solve the housing problem of these households, they had to adjust other people's houses, and in fact, one hundred and twenty-eight households were directly affected, and even more were indirectly affected. This matter has caused ideological confusion among the masses. Those who live in large and good houses are now generating doubts; those who originally planned to build new houses after the autumn harvest are now afraid to build them.

    The main reason for this problem is that when collective pig raising was promoted, it was not done in the spirit of self-raising and self-breeding, from nothing to something, from small to large. The tasks assigned from above were too large (the four cooperatives had a total task of more than 7,500 pigs). However, the methods for completing this task were not clearly explained. The cooperative cadres took the tasks back and started large-scale projects. There was no money to build new pigsties, so they had to forcibly occupy the houses of commune members. When moving houses, the farmers were unwilling to leave their homes easily, so the district cadres and cooperative cadres used lime to draw lines everywhere, planning pigsties. The masses believed that this was the government's policy.

    The households that were moved originally had large, numerous, and good houses, but now they generally have fewer, smaller, and poorer houses than before. According to statistics, the sixty-six households originally had 517 rooms, but now they only live in 342 rooms. The masses are very dissatisfied.

    We believe that this practice is wrong and has created a bad influence among the masses. We hope that the local government will quickly check and correct it.

    不该占社员房屋作猪栏
    我们在湘潭县的厚罗、永义、善扶、南村四个高级社摸了一下集体养猪的情况，发现他们为了解决猪栏问题，大量占用民房，四个社共搬出六十六户。为了解决这些户的住房问题，又要调剂别人房屋，实际直接被牵动的有一百二十八户，间接受影响的那就更多了。这件事引起了群众的思想混乱，现在住大屋、好屋的，产生疑虑；原拟秋后盖点新屋的，现在也不敢盖了。
    产生这个问题，主要是在提倡集体养猪时，没有本着自养自繁，由无到有，由小到大这一精神办事，自上而下分配任务过大（四个社共任务七千五百多头）。但对如何完成这一任务，办法交代不清，社干背了任务回去，大铺摊子，新建猪栏又没有钱，就只得强占社员的房屋。在搬房时，农民不愿轻意离开家园，区干部社干部就用石灰到处划线，规划猪栏，群众认为这是政府的政策。
    被搬的户原来房子又大又多又好，现在一般都比原来住房减少，并且又小又差。据统计六十六户原有住房五百一十七间，现在只住三百四十二间，群众很不满意。
    这种作法，我们认为是错误的，在群众中造成了不良影响。希望当地政府赶快检查纠正。
