Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Shanghai. More than 100,000 industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai are currently studying political theory and current affairs policies. A group of upper-level capitalists are studying philosophy and political economy at the spare-time political university run by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. More than 2,000 industrialists, businessmen, and their families have already graduated from the first phase of the Industry and Commerce Political School. The second phase, which opens this month, has more than 9,000 new students. Approximately 110,000 medium and small industrialists and businessmen throughout the city attend regular current affairs and policy lectures in various districts, studying domestic and international current events and the policies of socialist transformation. Many young capitalists and family members of industrialists and businessmen have also participated in study activities organized by youth and women's organizations in Shanghai.

Generally, industrialists and businessmen are very serious about their studies. Nearly 1,000 industrialists and businessmen, in addition to their own studies, also serve as lecturers for current affairs and policy lectures.

Through study, industrialists and businessmen have increased their knowledge and understood many new principles. Some capitalists used to believe that they were "accumulating profits" and "building a family fortune through diligence and thrift." After studying, they initially understood that workers cannot earn money without starting the machines, and that the original small factories becoming large factories was entirely the result of workers' labor. When students at the political school studied the issue of leadership in the Chinese revolution, some capitalists did not believe that the working class could lead the revolution. After the school organized students to visit the Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace to see the historical materials of the Shanghai workers' movement struggle and the Shanghai Industrial Production Advanced Experience Exhibition, many people's views changed. An elderly capitalist, recalling the scene of the "May 30th" Movement, said: "At that time, Shanghai workers went on strike and demonstrated, bravely fighting against the imperialists, while some of us were ostensibly closing our businesses but secretly continuing to trade. How can we compare with the working class?" Small business owners have a relatively low level of education and rarely participated in social activities in the past. After listening to the current affairs and policy reports, they recognized the greatness of the motherland's socialist construction, clearly understood the path they should take, and many people actively participated in cooperative groups or accepted sales agency business from state-owned companies. During the study, industrialists and businessmen freely discussed different opinions. The first phase of students at the Industry and Commerce Political School held a three-day debate on the question of whether capitalists exploit workers, with both sides listing reasons to persuade each other. In this way, many people had a relatively deep understanding of this issue, while some people had not fully understood it and retained their own views.

Since the high tide of socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai this year, industrialists and businessmen have successively requested to study politics and transform their thinking. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party helped relevant units establish study organizations and solve problems such as teaching materials and hiring lecturers. Public representatives and employees of various enterprises also encouraged private personnel to study and helped them arrange study time.

### 学习政治理论，改造资产阶级思想  上海市十多万工商业者积极参加各种学习组织

　　学习政治理论，改造资产阶级思想
    上海市十多万工商业者积极参加各种学习组织
    新华社讯　上海市有十多万工商业者正在学习政治理论和时事政策。一部分上层资本家在中国人民政治协商会议上海市委员会举办的业余政治大学学习哲学和政治经济学。二千多名工商业者和他们的家属已经在工商界政治学校第一期结业，这个月内开学的第二期又有九千多名入学。全市约有十一万名中、小工商业者在各区定期的时事政策讲座听讲，学习国内外时事和社会主义改造的政策。还有很多青年资本家和工商业者的家属，分别参加了上海的青年和妇女团体举办的学习活动。
    工商业者学习一般都很认真。有近一千名工商业者除了自己学习以外，还当了时事政策讲座的讲解员。
    在学习中，工商业者增长了不少知识，懂得了许多新的道理。有些资本家过去认为自己是“将本求利”、“勤俭起家”的，学习后初步了解工人不开动机器自己就赚不了钱，原来的小厂变成大厂完全是工人劳动创造的。政治学校学员在学习中国革命领导权问题的时候，有些资本家不大相信工人阶级能够领导革命。在学校组织学员参观了上海工人文化宫陈列的上海工人运动斗争史料和上海市工业生产先进经验展览会后，很多人的看法改变了。一个老年资本家回忆“五卅”运动时的情景说：“当时上海工人罢工示威，英勇地同帝国主义者斗争，而我们中有些人表面罢市，暗中仍然在干买卖，怎能和工人阶级相比？”小业主们文化水平比较低，过去很少参加社会活动，听了时事政策报告后，认识了祖国社会主义建设的伟大，认清了自己应走的道路，许多人积极参加合作小组，或者接受国营公司的代销业务。工商业者在学习中，对不同的意见进行了自由讨论。工商界政治学校第一期学员曾经就资本家是否剥削工人的问题举行了三天的辩论会，双方列举理由互相说服。这样，很多人比较深刻地认识了这个问题，有些人还没有完全搞通，保留了自己的见解。
    今年上海私营工商业社会主义改造高潮以后，工商业者纷纷要求学习政治，改造自己思想。中共上海市委员会帮助各有关单位建立学习组织和解决教材与聘请讲师等问题，各企业的公方代表和职工也鼓励私方人员学习，帮助他们安排学习时间。
