　　Threshing Machine Modified According to Local Characteristics
　　Tu Zhengfeng

The double-person pedal threshing machine with a threshing drum, which was modified by the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Department last year, has been promoted throughout Zhejiang Province this year and has been welcomed by the majority of farmers.

In the rice-growing areas of Zhejiang, the threshing methods vary depending on the variety of rice and the region where it is planted. In the late japonica rice areas of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, farmers are accustomed to carrying the harvested rice home, stacking it into rice piles, and then selecting a dry and flat site to thresh the rice grains. In the early, middle, and double-cropping rice areas of Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other regions, where rice is intercropped, the grains of early and middle rice ears tend to fall off easily, so farmers use wooden rice drums to thresh the grains in the fields while harvesting. As for threshing tools, except for the Jiaxing area, which began using semi-mechanized threshing machines for threshing more than twenty years ago, the vast majority of the province uses manual rice drums or threshing beds for threshing. These threshing tools are laborious, inefficient, and result in significant grain waste.

With the development of agricultural cooperativization, farmers are urgently demanding the improvement of threshing tools. In 1953, Zhejiang Province summarized the experience of using threshing machines in the Jiaxing area and carried out the first modification based on the specifications of the threshing machine manufactured by the Beijing Agricultural Machinery General Factory. The modified threshing machine is convenient to use, store, and maintain, and the price has also been reduced by 20%. However, this type of threshing machine can only be used in the square and cannot be used in paddy fields. The cultivated area of early, middle, double-cropping, and intercropped rice in Zhejiang Province is expanding year by year. If the method of moving rice and stalks home to thresh the grains is adopted, not only is the labor force insufficient, but the easily threshed early and middle rice will suffer great losses. Last year, the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Machinery Administration and the Ningbo Prefectural Farm, according to the local farmers' habit of threshing in the fields, absorbed the advantages of new and old threshing tools, and further successfully modified the double-person pedal threshing machine. This threshing machine can move in double-cropping and intercropped rice fields and thresh the grains while harvesting. This year, the supply of double-person pedal threshing machines has increased from 6,000 units last year to 88,900 units.

The modified double-person pedal threshing machine has many advantages: First, it is efficient. In the Xingfu Agricultural Cooperative in Daxi Township, Wenling County, six people harvest rice and two people thresh rice, and they can harvest 5,600 jin of rice per day, averaging 700 jin per person per day. If old rice drums are used for threshing, three people harvest rice and two people thresh rice, and on average, each person can only harvest 320 jin per day. Second, the threshing is clean, and the loss is small. When using old rice drums to thresh rice, the grains fly around, resulting in a lot of waste. According to the test conducted by the double-person pedal threshing machine technical training class opened in Hang County, threshing rice with a rice drum for half an hour results in a loss of eleven liang of rice, while threshing with a threshing machine for half an hour only results in a loss of two and a half liang of rice. The Wuxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Houchangli, Jinhua County, threshed the rice stalks that had been threshed with rice drums again with a threshing machine, and threshed out another seven jin and two liang of grains from half an acre of rice stalks. This summer harvest, Wenling County used more than 2,300 threshing machines, and it is estimated that the county can reduce the loss of 1.7 million jin of rice. Therefore, farmers call this threshing machine the "saving machine." Third, it is easy to use and operate, and women and semi-labor forces can use it. More than 80% of the female members of the Third Branch of the Xingfu Agricultural Cooperative in Daxi Township, Wenling County, participated in threshing, including a 66-year-old woman. In this way, male laborers can be fully invested in water trucking, harrowing, transplanting, and other work, and timely plant late rice, solving the difficulty of insufficient labor in rushing to harvest and plant. According to statistics from the agricultural department, agricultural production cooperatives in Jiaxing, Ningbo, Jinhua, Wenzhou, and other regions that used threshing machines this year accelerated the summer harvest progress by three to seven days compared to the average. Fourth, the threshing machine is modified using existing threshing tools, which makes hundreds of thousands of old threshing tools—rice drums, bamboo or cloth curtains—in Ningbo, Jinhua, and other regions of Zhejiang fully utilized.

    按照地方特点改装的打稻机
    屠正峰
    浙江省农业部门去年改装的、附有打稻机桶的双人脚踏打稻机，今年已在浙江全省推广，得到广大农民的欢迎。
    浙江水稻作物地区，由于稻谷的品种和地区的种植不同，各地的脱粒方法也不同。在杭（州）、嘉（兴）、湖（州）晚粳稻地区，农民们习惯在收割后挑回家中，叠成稻堆，然后选一个干燥平坦的场地来打稻脱粒。宁波、温州等早、中稻、双季连作和间作稻地区，由于早、中稻的稻穗粒子容易脱落，农民们就用木制的稻桶在田间随割随脱谷粒。打稻的工具，除嘉兴地区早在二十多年前开始使用半机械化的打稻机打稻脱粒外，全省绝大部分地区都是用人力打稻的稻桶或稻床。这种打稻工具费力多、效率低、谷子浪费也大。
    随着农业合作化的发展，农民们迫切要求改良打稻工具。1953年浙江省总结了嘉兴地区打稻机使用的经验，根据北京农业机械总厂所制造的打稻机的规格进行了第一次改装。改装后的打稻机在使用、保管和检修上都方便，而且价格也降低了20％。可是这种打稻机只能在广场用，不能在水田里用。浙江省的早、中稻、双季连作稻和间作稻的耕作面积正在逐年扩大。若采用连稻带秆搬回家去脱谷粒的方法，不仅劳动力不够，而且会使容易脱粒的早、中稻遭受很大损失。去年浙江省农业机械管理局和宁波专署农场，根据当地农民在田间打稻的习惯，吸取新旧打稻工具的优点，进一步改装成功了双人脚踏打稻机。这种打稻机，能在双季连作稻和间作稻田中移动，随割随脱谷粒。今年双人脚踏打稻机的供应量由去年的六千台增加到八万八千九百台。
    改装的双人脚踏打稻机好处很多：第一，效率高。温岭县大溪乡幸福农业合作社六人割稻，二人打稻，每日能割五千六百斤谷子，平均每人每天七百斤。如果用旧稻桶打稻，三人割稻，二人打稻，平均每人每天只能收三百二十斤。第二，脱粒干净、损失小。用旧稻桶打稻谷，谷粒四外飞散，浪费很多。据杭县开办的使用双人脚踏打稻机技术训练班试验证明：用稻桶打稻半小时，损失稻谷十一两，用打稻机打半小时只损失谷粒二两半。金华县后城里五星农业生产合作社把用稻桶打过的稻秆，再用打稻机打一遍，半亩地的稻秆又打出谷粒七斤二两。温岭县今年夏收中使用二千三百多台打稻机，估计全县可减少一百七十万斤稻谷的损失。因此，农民把这种打稻机叫做“节约机”。第三，使用轻便、操作省力，妇女和半劳动力均可使用。温岭县大溪乡幸福农业合作社第三分社共有80％以上的女社员参加打稻、其中还有六十六岁的老人。这样，就能使男劳动力全部投入车水、耙田、插秧等工作，及时种上晚稻，解决了抢收抢种中劳动力不足的困难。据农业部门统计，今年嘉兴、宁波、金华、温州等地区使用打稻机的农业生产合作社，夏收的进度比一般加快三至七天。第四，打稻机是利用旧有打稻工具改装的，这就使得浙江宁波、金华等地区几十万具旧的打稻工具——稻桶、竹或布的遮帘，得到了充分的利用。（附图片）
