Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 25th. After more than three years of exploration, the East China Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau's exploration team has proven that rich coal resources are stored around Xuzhou. In addition to the Jiawang coalfield in eastern and northeastern Xuzhou, the Qingshanquan, Dahuangshan, Xinqiao, and Panjia'an coalfields have also been confirmed by exploration. According to existing detailed survey and general survey materials, the estimated coal storage in these areas is 900 million tons. The Jiuli Mountain area in northwestern Xuzhou has a wider distribution of coalfields and abundant coal reserves. The coal reserves discovered by the exploration personnel of the Ministry of Geology in the Zhahe Plain area southwest of Xuzhou are also quite abundant. The quality of coal in these coalfields is very good, including gas coal, gas-fat coal, and fat coal, with very low sulfur, phosphorus, and ash content.

The coalfields around Xuzhou are located in the center of the Huaihai Plain, with the Jinpu and Longhai railways intersecting and running through them, and a dense network of highways, making transportation convenient. The exploitation of these coalfields is of great significance for supporting the industry in the southeast coast.

Before the exploration of the coalfields around Xuzhou, people only knew about the Jiawang coalfield. After years of mining, the remaining coal reserves in this coalfield are very small. After exploration, the scope of the Jiawang coalfield has been expanded, extending the life of the existing mines in the Jiawang coal mine by 50 years. The newly discovered Qingshanquan coalfield began construction in January last year; the Dahuangshan coalfield will also begin construction soon.

In the next few years, the East China Coalfield Geological Bureau will also conduct exploration in these areas to provide geological data for the construction of more mines.

    徐州周围发现丰富煤炭资源
    新华社南京25日电　华东煤田地质勘探局的勘探队经过三年多勘探证明，徐州周围蕴藏着丰富的煤炭资源。徐州东部和东北部除贾汪煤田外，经过勘探证实的还有青山泉、大黄山、新桥、潘家庵等煤田。这些地区根据已有的精查和普查的材料估计，储煤量有九亿吨。徐州西北的九里山地区，煤田分布更广，煤的藏量丰富。地质部所属的勘探人员在徐州西南的闸河平原地区发现的煤的蕴藏量也相当丰富。这些煤田煤的质量都很好，其中有气煤、气肥煤和肥煤，含硫、磷和灰分都很低。
    徐州周围的煤田位于淮海平原的中心，津浦、陇海两铁路交叉贯穿其中，公路密布，交通方便。这些煤田的开采，对支援东南沿海工业有重大意义。
    徐州周围的煤田没有勘探以前，人们只知道有一个贾汪煤田。这个煤田经过多年开采，剩余煤量已很少，经过勘探，扩大了贾汪煤田的范围，使贾汪煤矿现有矿井寿命延长五十年。新发现的青山泉煤田，去年1月开始建井；大黄山煤田最近也要动工建井。
    今后几年内，华东煤田地质局还将在这些地区进行勘探，为建设更多的矿井提供地质资料。
