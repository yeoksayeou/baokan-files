Xinhua News Agency Report: Many provinces and cities across the country are actively deploying winter illiteracy elimination learning. Beijing, Hebei, Henan, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Fujian, and other provinces and cities have successively convened or are convening illiteracy elimination work conferences to deploy this work.

After investigation and research, the illiteracy elimination tasks proposed by various regions for this winter generally require the number of enrolled students to reach about 50% of the local young and middle-aged illiterate population. Gansu Province requires an enrollment of 2.8 million people on the basis of last year's enrollment. Zhejiang Province plans to organize 4.5 million people, accounting for 54% of the young and middle-aged illiterate population, to participate in learning, an increase of 1 million people compared to last winter and spring. Jiangxi Province requires that this winter achieve "every village has a school, every commune runs education." Hebei Province has put forward different requirements according to different regions: areas with better conditions should enroll more people, areas with poor conditions or lightly affected disaster areas should enroll fewer people, and severely affected disaster areas generally do not set specific tasks, but actively support those who can combine production for self-relief and voluntarily participate in learning.

Various regions have paid attention to strengthening the leadership of illiteracy elimination learning this winter. Hebei Province has submitted opinions to special districts and counties on rural winter illiteracy elimination work, requiring continued extensive and in-depth publicity and education work, organizing literate people to serve as teachers, doing a good job in textbook supply, rectifying illiteracy elimination associations, and improving the grassroots leadership of township and commune illiteracy elimination work. The Education Department of Zhejiang Province has prepared a large number of teaching materials. In addition to the first volume of illiteracy elimination textbooks, there are 3 million copies of the second and third volumes, which can basically ensure that everyone has books to read. Some townships and communes in Hongzhao County and Jiaocheng County in Shanxi Province, and Heishan County in Liaoning Province have already drafted winter learning plans for farmers and have begun training amateur teachers. Hengshan County in Hunan Province plans to establish illiteracy elimination associations universally this winter, achieving associations in every township, branches in every commune, and groups in every team. Rong County Special District in Guangxi Province has determined that from the special district to the county and district levels, the Party committee will be the center, and heads of education departments, the Communist Youth League, and women's federations will form core illiteracy elimination groups to conduct regular research and inspection to strengthen leadership over illiteracy elimination work.

    各地积极部署今冬扫盲学习
    据新华社讯　全国许多省、市积极部署今冬的扫盲学习，北京、河北、河南、四川、江西、江苏、湖南、湖北、浙江、福建等省、市，都已经先后召开或正在召开扫盲工作会议，部署这一工作。
    各地经过调查研究后提出的今冬的扫盲任务，一般要求入学人数能达到当地青壮年文盲的50％左右。甘肃省要求在去年入学的基础上有二百八十万人入学。浙江省准备组织四百五十万人，即青壮年文盲的54％参加学习，比去冬今春增加一百万人。江西省要求今冬达到“村村有校，社社办学”。河北省根据不同地区提出了不同的要求：条件较好的地区入学的人数多一些，条件较差的或轻灾区少一些，重灾区一般的不提具体任务，但是对于能结合生产自救，自愿参加学习的人，要积极支持。
    各地已经注意加强今冬扫盲学习的领导。河北省已向专区、县提出关于农村冬季扫盲工作的意见，要求继续开展广泛深入的宣传教育工作，组织识字的人担任教师，做好课本供应工作，整顿扫盲协会，改进乡、社扫盲工作的基层领导。浙江省教育厅已经准备好大量教材，除扫盲课本第一册外，二、三册课本有三百万册，基本上能保证人人有书读。山西省洪赵县、交城县和辽宁省黑山县有些乡、社已经拟订好农民冬季学习计划，并且开始训练业余教师。湖南省衡山县准备今冬把扫盲协会普遍建立起来，做到乡乡有协会，社社有分会，队队有小组。广西省容县专区确定从专区到县、区各级以党委为中心，同教育部门、青年团、妇联等单位的负责人成立扫盲核心小组，进行定期研究和检查，以加强对扫盲工作的领导。
