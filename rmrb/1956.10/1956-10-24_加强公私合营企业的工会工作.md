Strengthening Trade Union Work in Joint State-Private Enterprises
Dong Xin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

At the beginning of this year, the nationwide implementation of joint state-private ownership in capitalist industry and commerce was a decisive victory for our Party's policy of peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Under the leadership of the Party, trade union organizations united the masses of workers and staff in capitalist industry and commerce across the country, enthusiastically supporting and promoting this work of nationwide joint state-private ownership. The rapid and successful realization of nationwide joint ownership was greatly aided by the warm support and active actions of the masses of workers and staff. The fundamental change in the nature of enterprises after the full joint ownership stimulated the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff. Whether in factories or shops, socialist emulation campaigns were widely launched after the joint ownership, and labor productivity and work efficiency were significantly improved.

There is no doubt that our achievements in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce are enormous. However, because the nationwide joint ownership of tens of thousands of capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises was rapidly realized in a relatively short period of time, some of our specific work did not keep up in this extremely complex and arduous transformation process, and some specific problems were not handled perfectly enough. As a result, some workers still have opinions on the handling of certain specific issues after the joint ownership, and even generated the kind of doubts that Comrade Chen Yun pointed out in his speech at the Eighth National Congress of the Party. The main reasons are:

First, our propaganda and education work among the masses of workers and staff was not deep and specific enough. We did not do enough specific explanatory work based on the specific problems in the process of joint ownership and combined with the actual understanding of the workers. Therefore, on the one hand, some workers and staff actively supported the Party's policy of peaceful transformation, but on the other hand, they lacked a correct understanding of some specific issues, such as the arrangements and care for capitalists, the lenient handling of financial issues, and the uniform five percent fixed interest, and believed that "the capitalists are getting too good a deal."

Second, before the joint ownership, trade union organizations and the masses of workers and staff exercised strict supervision over private enterprises, and trade unions had high power in enterprise management. After the joint ownership, the nature of the enterprises underwent fundamental changes, and some of the powers and work of the trade unions during the private ownership period should also be handed over to the state representatives. However, the enterprise leadership should still pay sufficient attention to the role that the trade union organizations had played during the private ownership period, and fully utilize the spirit of the masses' responsibility for the enterprise, and earnestly absorb the masses to participate in enterprise management. However, some state representatives did not pay enough attention to this issue, and they did not do enough to rely on the masses and trade union organizations to do a good job in the transformation work and production work.

The production increase and economy committees during the private ownership period were abolished, but new organizations to attract the masses to participate in management have not been established. While some regions have paid attention to promoting a large number of outstanding workers and staff to serve as state representatives, many regions have neglected to promote suitable workers to take on certain leadership positions in their units when dispatching state representatives to factories and arranging private personnel. After warmly welcoming the joint state-private ownership, the masses of workers and staff felt very dissatisfied when they encountered this situation.

Third, some joint enterprises, especially those merged and reorganized from small factories and shops, had very poor living welfare and working conditions for their workers and staff during the private ownership period. They had long hoped to change this situation after the joint ownership. However, after the joint ownership, many enterprises did not pay enough attention to the demands of the masses of workers and staff in this regard, and many problems that were indeed urgent to solve and could be solved were not solved in time. Therefore, when the government made appropriate arrangements and care for the lives of the capitalists, although this arrangement and care was completely necessary, it also created some illusions among some of the workers and staff.

In addition, most capitalists have been working hard, actively learning, and paying attention to eliminating the gap between themselves and the workers and staff after taking on leadership positions in enterprises. However, there are also a few capitalists who, after taking on leadership positions in enterprises, still treat workers with a bad old style, and even individual capitalists who use their power to retaliate against workers. These people have not been given the due criticism, struggle, and appropriate handling, which has also caused some dissatisfaction among the workers and staff.

To solve these problems, we should strengthen the ideological education work of the trade unions. In recent years, especially since the "Five-Anti" campaign in 1952, in order to implement the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, the masses of workers and staff and trade union organizations have exercised strict supervision over capitalist enterprises, which has played a major role in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. After the joint ownership, the state sent state representatives, which means that the state directly manages production, and the state power originally exercised by the trade union organizations is exercised by the state representatives. This is progress, not regression. This change has not only not reduced the rights of the working class to manage enterprises, but has precisely increased these rights. Because after the joint ownership, the working class has become the complete master of the enterprise, and the capitalists can only exercise the functions of an ordinary engineering technician or employee, and they have lost the qualification of the master of the enterprise. However, most capitalists have production technology and management ability, and our appropriate arrangement of them is to use their production technology and management ability to serve socialist construction. This is beneficial to the working class. Therefore, on the one hand, trade union organizations should help private personnel transform their ideology and work style, and on the other hand, they should also educate workers and staff to support them in exercising their powers within their scope of responsibilities.

The changes in the nature of enterprises after the nationwide joint ownership and the state's policy towards capitalists should be further explained to the masses. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions is preparing to launch a discussion on these issues among the masses of workers and staff in joint state-private enterprises across the country, and to solve these problems in light of the actual situation.

In addition to strengthening ideological education, we must also take certain organizational measures and adopt appropriate methods to attract the masses of workers and staff to participate in enterprise management, in order to promote the enthusiasm and responsible spirit of the masses. It is necessary to universally establish democratic management committees composed of responsible cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, representatives of the private side, and representatives elected from the workers and staff in joint enterprises. All major issues concerning the enterprise should be discussed in the management committee. This is not only a form of attracting workers to participate in management, but also a form of uniting, educating, and transforming private personnel. At the same time, the trade union should consult with the masses and recommend a group of workers and staff who can connect with the masses, are familiar with production technology, and have certain abilities to serve as certain leadership positions or state representatives in their enterprises. This will further enhance the sense of responsibility of the workers and staff as masters of the enterprise, and they will no longer have any illusions about the arrangements for the capitalists.

In addition, while mobilizing workers and staff to continuously improve and increase production, we must take effective measures to improve working conditions and meet the reasonable demands of workers and staff in their lives. At present, the urgent demands of workers and staff in joint enterprises in this regard are: 1. Reasonably adjust wages; 2. Implement labor insurance and solve the problem of medical treatment for illnesses; 3. Improve living conditions and solve the housing problem; 4. Solve the problems of labor protection and working hours; 5. Solve the problems of canteens, nurseries, and cultural and recreational facilities.

In order to solve the wage problem of workers and staff in joint enterprises, the Party Central Committee and the State Council entrusted the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to convene the National Wage Conference for Newly Joint State-Private Enterprises, which specifically conducted research and discussions, and has already drafted a reform plan. Plans have also been proposed for labor insurance and housing problems. The remaining problems should also be gradually and appropriately solved as necessary and possible.

In order to solve the welfare problems of workers and staff, we believe that the part of the collective welfare fund that was allocated according to the profit distribution system (four horses sharing the fat) before the joint ownership should still be used to solve the welfare problems of workers and staff. At the same time, we suggest that the enterprise bonus fund system should also be universally implemented in joint state-private enterprises.

In short, if we pay attention to carrying out the above-mentioned work among the masses of workers and staff in joint enterprises, we will certainly be able to better play the role of joint state-private enterprises in developing the national economy and prepare for the realization of state ownership.

    加强公私合营企业的工会工作
    中华全国总工会书记处书记　董昕
    今年年初，全国资本主义工商业实行了全行业公私合营，这是我们党对资本主义工商业和平改造政策的决定性的胜利。在党的领导下，工会组织团结了全国资本主义工商业中的职工群众，欢欣鼓舞地拥护、支持和推动了这个全行业公私合营的工作。全行业公私合营所以能迅速地胜利实现，职工群众的热烈拥护和积极行动起了巨大的作用。全行业合营以后企业性质的根本变化，激发了广大职工群众的劳动热情，无论工厂或商店，在合营之后，都广泛地开展了社会主义竞赛，劳动生产率和工作效率有了显著的提高。
    毫无疑问，我们对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的成就是巨大的。但是，由于在一个较短的时间内，迅速地实现了成千成万户资本主义工商业的全行业合营，在这个极其复杂艰巨的改造过程中，我们的有些具体工作没有及时地跟上去，有些具体问题处理的还不够完善，因此一部分工人对合营以后某些具体问题的处理上还有些意见，甚至产生了像陈云同志在党的第八次代表大会的发言中所指出的那种怀疑。主要的原因是：
    第一，我们对职工群众的宣传教育工作不够深入、具体，根据合营过程中的若干具体问题结合职工的实际认识，进行具体的解释工作作得不够。因此，一部分职工群众，一方面积极地拥护党的和平改造政策，另一方面遇到一些具体问题，例如对资本家的安排和照顾、财务问题的从宽处理、定息一律五厘等等，就缺乏正确的认识，认为“太便宜了资本家”。
    第二，在合营以前，工会组织和工人群众对私营企业实行着严格的监督，工会对企业管理方面有很高的权力。在合营以后，企业的性质起了根本变化，私营时期工会的某些权力和工作也应该交给公方代表，不过企业领导上还是应当十分注意工会组织在私营时期曾发挥的作用，充分运用群众的对企业负责的精神，认真吸收群众参加企业管理；但是，有些公方代表没有足够地来重视这个问题，他们对于依靠群众和工会组织作好改造工作和搞好生产工作，作得很不够。
    私营时期的增产节约委员会取消了，而新的吸引群众参加管理的组织却没有建立起来。固然有些地区注意了大量提拔优秀的职工担任公方代表，但是也有不少地区在派遣公方代表下厂、安排私方人员的时候，忽视了提拔条件适当的职工，担负本单位的某些领导职务。职工群众在热烈地迎接公私合营之后，遇到了这种情况，就感到很不满足。
    第三，有些合营企业，特别是由小厂小店合并改组的企业，在私营时期，职工的生活福利、劳动条件是很不好的，他们很早以前就希望在合营以后改变这种状况，可是合营以后，许多企业对于职工群众这方面的要求重视不够，许多确实迫切需要解决而又可能解决的问题没有及时解决。因此，当政府对资本家的生活作了适当的安排和照顾的时候，虽然这种安排和照顾是完全必要的，可是也在这部分职工群众中产生了一些错觉。
    另外，大多数资本家在担任了企业的领导职务以后都是努力学习、积极工作，并且注意消除同职工群众之间的隔阂的。但是，也有少数资本家在担任了企业领导职务以后，仍然以恶劣的旧作风对待工人，甚至有个别资本家，利用职权对工人进行报复。这些人并没有受到应有的批评、斗争和适当的处理，这也引起职工群众的一些不满。
    要解决这些问题，应该加强工会的思想教育工作。几年来，特别是1952年“五反”以来，为了贯彻对资本主义工商业的利用、限制和改造的政策，职工群众和工会组织对资本主义企业实行了严格的监督，这对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造是起了重大作用的。合营以后，国家派了公方代表，这就是由国家直接管理生产，工会组织原来行使的那种国家权力由公方代表去行使了。这是前进而不是倒退，这种变化不仅没有降低工人阶级对企业管理的权利，恰恰是提高了这种权利。因为在合营以后，工人阶级成了企业的完全的主人，而资本家只能行使一个普通工程技术人员或职员的职权，他们已经失去了企业主人的资格。可是多数资本家是有生产技术和管理能力的，我们将他们适当安排，就是运用他们的生产技术和管理能力，为社会主义建设服务。这对工人阶级是有利的。因此，工会组织一方面应该帮助私方人员改造思想作风，另一方面也要教育职工群众支持他们行使自己职责范围以内的职权。
    关于全行业合营以后企业性质的变化和国家对资本家的政策，应该进一步对群众解释清楚。中华全国总工会准备在全国公私合营企业的职工群众中发动一次关于这些问题的讨论，结合实际情况来解决这些问题。
    除了加强思想教育工作，还必须采取一定的组织措施，采取适当的方式，吸引职工群众参加企业管理，以发扬群众的积极性和负责精神。在合营企业中普遍建立由党、行政、工会、青年团的负责干部，私方代表以及职工中选举的代表组成的民主管理委员会，是有必要的。凡有关企业的重大问题，都应该在管理委员会上讨论。这不仅是吸引工人参加管理的一种形式，而且是团结、教育、改造私方人员的一种形式。同时，应当由工会和群众商量，推荐一批能联系群众、熟悉生产技术、有一定能力的职工担任本企业的某些领导职务或公方代表。这样就能更加提高职工群众的主人翁的责任感，他们对于安排资本家也就不会再产生什么错觉了。
    此外，还必须在动员职工群众不断改进和提高生产的同时，采取有效措施，改善劳动条件，满足职工群众生活上的合理要求。目前，合营企业中职工群众在这方面的迫切要求是：一、合理调整工资；二、实行劳动保险，解决疾病医疗问题；三、改善居住条件，解决住宅问题；四、解决劳动保护和工时制度的问题；五、解决食堂、托儿所和文化娱乐场所的问题。
    为了解决合营企业中职工的工资问题，党中央和国务院曾委托中华全国总工会召开了全国新公私合营企业工资会议，专门进行了研究和讨论，并且已经拟定了改革方案。对于劳动保险和住宅问题也已经提出了方案。其余的问题，也应该根据必要和可能，逐步地适当地给以解决。
    为了解决职工的生活福利问题，我们认为，在合营之前按分配利润制度（四马分肥）分配，积存下来的那部分集体福利金应该仍然把它用之于解决职工的生活福利问题。同时，我们建议在公私合营企业中也普遍实行企业奖励基金制度。
    总之，如果我们在合营企业的职工群众中注意进行上述这些工作，我们就一定能够更好地发挥公私合营企业在发展国民经济中的作用，并且为实现国有化作好准备。
