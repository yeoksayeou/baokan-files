Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 10th: Shanghai's Putuo District has already processed the vast majority of the more than 500 suggestions made by People's Representatives during their inspection work in June of this year.

The factories inspected attached great importance to the suggestions made by the People's Representatives regarding cooling down the workshops and adding protective equipment. The state-owned Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory mobilized personnel from many departments and workshops to jointly formulate a detailed plan for handling the opinions of the People's Representatives after their inspection. They also designated specific personnel to be responsible for each task, setting a deadline for completion. After the inspection by the People's Representatives, the Fufeng Flour Mill, the Tongji Printing and Dyeing Factory, and others organized major safety production inspections and actively trained maintenance workers. They improved the workshops' protective, cooling, and lighting equipment. The Datong Cotton Mill conducted safety equipment inspections and promptly repaired the damaged safety guards on forty looms, preventing possible flying shuttle accidents.

Under the supervision of the People's Representatives' inspection, the Putuo District People's Committee and various factories have also taken various active measures to improve the living conditions of workers and residents. After hearing the People's Representatives' reflections on the poor living conditions of residents in some areas of the district, Gu Songsheng and Hang Huilan, the deputy district heads of the district, led relevant personnel to focus on improving the living conditions of employees on the spot. By the end of September, more than 500 households of workers and residents in the district who originally lived in cramped and dilapidated shacks and tile houses had been rebuilt or repaired. The lighting and sanitary environment of the houses had also been improved simultaneously.

    上海市普陀区认真处理人民代表的建议
    据新华社上海10日电　上海普陀区人民代表今年6月在视察工作中提出的五百多件意见，绝大部分已经得到处理。
    被视察的工厂对人民代表提出的车间降温和增添防护设备等建议很重视。国营上海第二纺织机械厂动员很多科室、车间人员，共同制定了人民代表视察意见处理的详细计划，并且分别指定专人负责，限期完成。阜丰面粉厂、同济印染厂等在人民代表视察后，就组织安全生产大检查，还积极地培养了一些保全工人，改善了车间的防护、降温、照明等设备，大同棉纺织厂通过安全设备检查，及时检修了四十台布机上已经损坏的防护罩，防止了可能发生的飞梭事故。
    在人民代表视察的督促下，普陀区人民委员会和各工厂还采取了种种积极措施，来改善工人和居民的居住状况。这个区的副区长顾松盛、杭惠兰听到人民代表反映这个区某些地区居民居住条件太差的情况以后，就领导有关人员，有重点地进行了就地改善职工居住条件的工作。到9月底止，这个区五百多户工人、居民原住的狭小破漏的草棚和瓦房已经重新翻造或进行了修理，房屋的照明和卫生环境也同时有了改善。
