    Evidence of Crime
    This is one of the pieces of evidence of the Kuomintang secret agents' planning and directing of the great riot. During this riot, those who directed the bandits in robbery, murder, and sabotage, in addition to carrying the Kuomintang flag, also wore badges on their chests. The badge now published is one of those they wore. The number printed on the back of this badge is "I-166," and there are four small characters: "Made by Cai Hanshan." The front has a colored Kuomintang flag and three interlocking circles. (Originally published in the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" on October 21.) (Attached picture)

    罪证
    这是国民党特务策划和指挥大骚乱的罪证之一。在这次大骚乱中，指挥匪徒们从事劫杀捣乱的，除了手执国民党旗外，胸际还悬有徽章，现在刊出的这枚徽章，就是他们所悬者之一。这枚徽章背面印出的编号是“I一六六”，还有四个小字：“蔡汉山制”。正面是着了颜色的国民党旗和三个连环圆圈。（原载10月21日香港“大公报”。）（附图片）
