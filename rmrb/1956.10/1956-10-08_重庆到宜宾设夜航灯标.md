    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 5th -- On the evening of the 1st, navigation beacons were lit for the first time on the Chongqing to Yibin section of the Yangtze River's upper reaches. This extends the Yangtze River's night navigation section by more than 360 kilometers. The round trip time for ships between Chongqing and Yibin has been reduced from six days to five days.
    The oil-lamp beacons previously used between Chengluji to Hankou in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and between Jiujiang and Jiangyin in the lower reaches have all been replaced with electric light beacons starting from the 1st. These two sections of the waterway are approximately 900 kilometers long.
    In addition, navigation beacons were recently installed on the Yangtze River trunk line to Chongming and on the Yangtze River trunk line to Qinglonggang, Tai'an, and other places. Ships can now travel day and night in these areas.

    重庆到宜宾设夜航灯标
    新华社武汉5日电　长江上游重庆到宜宾的航道上，在一日晚上第一次亮起了灯标。长江夜航地段至此又向上延伸了三百六十多公里。船只在重庆、宜宾间往返一次的时间，已由六天缩短到五天。
    长江中游城陆矶到汉口之间和下游九江到江阴之间原来用油灯的灯标，自一日起全部改成电气灯标。这两段航道共长九百公里左右。
    此外，长江干线到崇明和长江干线到青龙港、泰安等地的航道上，不久以前也新设了灯标。现在在这些地方，船只都能昼夜通行了。
