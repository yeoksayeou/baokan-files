Xinhua News Agency, October 6th: Many local industrial enterprises in Beijing have established extensive connections with relevant departments and have obtained their assistance, thereby improving product quality.

The Beijing Chemical Reagent Factory, with the technical and theoretical assistance of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has brought the quality of 158 of its products up to Soviet quality standards. When the Yihua Musical Instrument Factory encountered a problem with the production of a certain instrument, they sought guidance from musicians who played the instrument in the Central Song and Dance Troupe or the Central Experimental Opera House. Their products are also quality-tested by professional artistic groups, who provide suggestions for improvement. The artistic groups also provide the factory with instrument designs and help workers organize orchestras, so that the instrument-making workers understand how to use them, in order to better improve quality. Now, the variety of products in this factory has increased from six to forty-four, and eleven kinds of instruments have reached international standards in terms of scales. With the help of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, the product quality of the Qianjin Steel File Factory has also reached the advanced domestic level.

Local industrial factories often obtain supervision of product quality from sales departments and users through visits, letters, and seminars. Yili Food Company and Beijing Food Factory often hold "tasting sessions," inviting salespeople from the sales departments to taste the products and improve quality based on their opinions. Now, quality problems such as softening candies, sour bread, and shrinking and drying cakes produced by Yili Food Company have been solved.

    同有关部门建立联系加强研究
    北京许多工业企业提高产品质量
    新华社6日讯　北京市许多地方工业企业同有关部门建立广泛联系，并取得他们的帮助，提高了产品质量。
    北京市化学试剂厂由于得到中国科学院技术理论的帮助，使一百五十八种产品的质量达到了苏联产品的质量标准。艺华乐器厂生产一种乐器发生了问题，就找中央歌舞团或中央实验歌剧院演奏这种乐器的人来指导。他们的产品还由专业文艺团体鉴定质量，提出改进意见；文艺团体也供给工厂乐器式样，帮助工人组织乐队，使制造乐器的工人懂得如何使用，以便更好地提高质量。现在，这个工厂的产品种类已经由六种增加到四十四种，有十一种乐器在音阶方面达到了国际水平。前进钢锉厂在北京钢铁工业学院的帮助下，产品质量也已经达到国内先进水平。
    地方工业工厂经常以访问、写信、开座谈会等方式，取得销售部门和用户对产品质量的监督。义利食品公司、北京市食品厂都常常举行“品赏会”，请销售部门的售货员来尝尝味道，根据他们的意见改进质量。现在义利食品公司生产的糖果软化，面包发酸，蛋糕收缩发干等质量问题都已经解决了。
