    Recent New Developments in the International Situation
    Gu Si
    The "Eighth National Congress" and China's Foreign Relations
    The recently concluded Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China has ushered in a new page in Chinese history. This is not only a historic event for the Chinese people but also a major event in international life.
    The resolution of the Eighth National Congress on the political report defined our country's policy in international affairs as follows: (1) To continue to consolidate and strengthen the eternal and unbreakable fraternal friendship with the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries; (2) To establish and develop friendly relations with Asian and African countries and others that endorse the "Five Principles"; (3) To establish and develop normal diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations with all countries willing to establish diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations with our country; (4) To continue to oppose the use of force and the threat of force in international affairs and oppose policies of preparing for new wars; (5) To support the peace movement of the people of the world and develop friendly exchanges with the people of all countries; (6) To oppose colonialism and support all anti-colonialist struggles and struggles to defend national sovereignty in Asia, Africa, and Latin America; (7) to support the socialist movements of the working class and working people of all countries and strengthen the internationalist unity of the proletariat of all countries; (8) To educate our own personnel to adopt a truly equal attitude in dealing with all foreign countries and foreign peoples and strictly oppose great-power chauvinism in exchanges with all foreign countries and foreign peoples.
    Following these correct guidelines, the friendly exchanges and connections between our country and other countries have greatly developed in recent years and will surely continue to be consolidated and expanded in the future.
    The development of China's foreign relations during and around the Eighth National Congress is heartening. More than 2,000 foreign guests from over fifty countries participated in this year's National Day celebrations, exceeding the number of foreign guests in previous National Day celebrations. Indonesian President Sukarno, Nepalese Prime Minister Acharya, Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy, Burmese Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League Chairman U Nu, as well as the Indian Parliamentary Delegation and Military Delegation, visited our country successively and were warmly welcomed by our people. Prior to this, Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, visited India, Burma, Pakistan, and Indonesia, and was similarly warmly received by these countries. This is a friendly exchange between our country and countries that have developed friendly relations with our country on the basis of the Five Principles. This frequent exchange has greatly promoted the development of friendly relations.
    We have also made new friends with other neighboring countries. Not long ago, Cambodian Prime Minister Sihanouk and Laotian Prime Minister Phouma successively visited our country. Recently, our country has established diplomatic relations with Syria and Yemen and will establish diplomatic representation with Ceylon. Up to now, twenty-nine countries have established diplomatic relations with our country, with a population of more than one billion.
    Our country's trade, cultural, and people-to-people exchanges with various countries have also greatly developed. More than sixty countries are now trading with our country.
    In addition, the extensive contacts and connections between our country and Western European and Latin American countries are also a development to be cherished.
    Our country's foreign ties are expanding greatly, and our country's international standing is increasing greatly. All those who value reality cannot but recognize that China should occupy its due place in international affairs. However, to this day, some people are still trying hard to obliterate the existence of the People's Republic of China and its indisputable legitimate status in the international community, and even dream of creating "two Chinas." However, this kind of activity will not yield any result other than harming themselves.
    Starting from the Soviet Union's Great Harvest
    This year, the Soviet Union achieved its largest grain harvest in history. The amount of grain sold by collective farms to the state greatly exceeded the state plan. The amount of grain sold by the Kazakh Republic was more than the total amount of grain sold in the eleven years before the large-scale reclamation of wasteland. The Soviet Union's great grain harvest can meet all the basic needs of the Soviet people for grain, enable the state to have more grain reserves, better support industrial construction and livestock development, and also increase grain exports. This year's great grain harvest in the Soviet Union is a great victory for the development of agriculture in the Soviet Union, a victory resulting from the Soviet Union's adoption of measures to rapidly develop agriculture and large-scale reclamation of wasteland (35.5 million hectares have been reclaimed). The Soviet Union's large-scale agricultural development plan was ridiculed by some Western bourgeois newspapers as a "gamble" and a "fantasy," but this harvest shows that the ambitious agricultural production increase plan stipulated in the new Five-Year Plan can not only be fully realized but also overfulfilled.
    The economic development of the entire socialist camp presents a flourishing scene. This year, the Soviet Union and the European people's democratic countries, except Bulgaria, have all begun the construction of a new Five-Year Plan on a larger scale, which will increase the total industrial output by more than 50% to 60% and agricultural output by more than 20% to 70%. The completion of the plan in the first half of this year was extremely good. Our people are also striving to overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan. At the same time, the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China has put forward suggestions for the second Five-Year Plan, requiring the total industrial and agricultural output value in 1962 to increase by about 75% compared with 1957. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which are carrying out restoration work under difficult conditions, have also made outstanding achievements. The Korean people have completed the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
    On the basis of the huge development of economic construction, a new type of mutual assistance and cooperation between socialist countries is being further strengthened and developed. Their friendly exchanges with each other are also becoming more frequent.
    The strong development and mutual assistance and cooperation of socialist countries is the most vivid and important feature of our era.
    At the same time, the foreign relations of socialist countries are also expanding and developing day by day. It is particularly noteworthy that after many people's democratic countries joined the United Nations, their role in international affairs has greatly increased. The friendly and cooperative relations between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries and Asian and African countries have undergone new developments. Economic and trade relations between the East and the West are opening up broad prospects. In 1955, the Soviet Union's foreign trade increased by more than three times compared with the pre-war period, while the foreign trade of the capitalist world increased by only 60% during the same period. In world trade, the Soviet Union has risen from the sixteenth to the sixth place. Since the beginning of this year, European people's democratic countries have also signed more than twenty trade agreements with various countries. This kind of contact and exchange has expanded the international influence of socialist countries and become an important factor in strengthening peace and international cooperation.
      The Soviet-Japanese Negotiations Reach an Agreement
    The efforts of socialist countries and the people of other countries to strive for the normal development of international relations have continuously achieved new successes. The Soviet-Japanese negotiations on restoring normal relations, which were recently held in Moscow, have reached an agreement. The two countries issued a joint declaration, deciding that the state of war between the two countries is declared over, re-establishing peaceful and good-neighborly relations, and exchanging diplomatic representatives at the ambassadorial level. This is an important event that is beneficial to Japan's move towards independence and autonomy and to the cause of world peace.
    The Soviet-Japanese negotiations have lasted for more than a year and have been conducted in four rounds. During the first meeting held in June last year, both sides had already reached an agreement on the basic terms of the peace treaty, and there was originally no reason why an agreement could not be reached. However, the United States and the pro-American faction in Japan used the territorial issue as an obstacle and interrupted the talks. In May of this year, the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Treaty negotiations achieved results, stipulating that the treaty would take effect after the peace treaty was signed or normal relations were established, which promoted the third meeting. At the third meeting, the plenipotentiary representative of Japan attending the negotiations, Mamoru Shigemitsu, also believed at the time that the peace treaty could be signed. However, due to pressure from the United States and fierce disputes within the Japanese government, the talks fell into a standstill again. At this time, the American reactionaries, seeing that the overall situation was becoming increasingly unfavorable to themselves, blatantly carried out interference and sabotage activities. Dulles openly threatened that if Japan did not insist on territorial demands from the Soviet Union, the United States would annex the Ryukyu Islands. The pro-American faction in Japan also carried out extensive activities, demanding that the Japanese-Soviet negotiations be terminated forever, and instigated the downfall of the Hatoyama cabinet. However, the Japanese people launched a powerful movement demanding the immediate restoration of normal relations with the Soviet Union, giving the American and Japanese reactionaries a powerful counterattack and promoting the dramatic division of the Japanese ruling clique. The Hatoyama group, which came to power with the restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and China as its political capital, saw that the conditions for striving for the success of the negotiations had matured, and if it was to be delayed any longer, its political position would be in danger. Therefore, he overcame obstacles from all sides and decided to go to Moscow in person to negotiate with the Soviet Union in the manner of restoring diplomatic relations first and leaving the territorial issue for future negotiations.
    The process of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations over the past year has been permeated with the sincere efforts of the Soviet government and the sharp struggle of the Japanese people against American interference, against the obstruction of the pro-American faction in Japan, and striving for independence and autonomy. The Japanese people are extremely excited about the outcome of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations. Public opinion generally demands that Japan should begin to adopt a new independent and autonomous foreign policy and promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. The United States and the pro-American faction in Japan are of course unhappy, and will inevitably try their best to obstruct it. However, facts have proved that the united struggle of the democratic progressive forces and all patriots in Japan can defeat the criminal activities of the American and Japanese reactionaries that harm Japan's interests and independent sovereignty.
    Egypt's Victory
    Egypt's heroic struggle to recover the Suez Canal Company has achieved a major initial victory with the support of peace-loving people all over the world. After the British, French, and American policy of armed intervention was opposed by world opinion, they had no choice but to submit the Suez Canal issue to the United Nations Security Council on September 23. On October 13, the Security Council adopted six principles based on respect for Egyptian sovereignty, creating conditions for peaceful negotiations.
    After the "Dulles Plan" was rejected by Egypt and the "persuasion to surrender" by the Menzies Five-Member Committee failed, the British, French, and American colonialists secretly formulated an even more sinister "Association of Canal Users" plan to forcibly seize the canal. The implementation of this plan would inevitably lead to armed intervention and create an irreparable situation in the Middle East. This plan not only aroused great indignation among the Egyptian people but also aroused unanimous condemnation from public opinion in various countries. Indian Prime Minister Nehru accused the plan of containing the danger of war. The Chinese and Soviet governments have successively issued statements expressing that they cannot stand idly by and turn a deaf ear to this provocative behavior.
    This powerful pressure from world opinion caused the London conference held in September to establish the "Association of Canal Users" to fall into chaos from the very beginning. Many countries that originally supported the "Dulles Plan" adopted a lukewarm attitude towards the "Association of Canal Users," did not approve of the use of force, and demanded negotiations with Egypt. As a result, the conference had to end in a hurry, and the countries did not even sign the declaration and other documents issued by the conference. Later, although the "Association of Canal Users" was established, Pakistan, Ethiopia, and Japan refused to formally participate, and many other countries also put forward reservations. The results of the London conference show that the policy of intimidation, threats, and violence against Egypt is unrealistic.
    At this London conference, the contradictions between Britain, France, and the United States became more apparent. The United States fully exposed its double-dealing attitude at the London conference. On the one hand, it came up with the "Association of Canal Users" for Britain and France and coerced Egypt together with Britain and France in an attempt to violate Egypt's sovereignty. On the other hand, it pretended to be a good person, expressing that it did not support Britain and France in using force, and attempted to portray itself as not being a colonialist. At the same time, it also put forward the proposition of boycotting the canal, sailing around the Cape of Good Hope, and imposing economic sanctions on Egypt. This was an extremely sinister plan with a double purpose. The United States attempted to use this method to put pressure on Egypt on the one hand, to sow discord between Egypt and other Arab countries and Asian and African countries, so as to isolate Egypt and force Egypt to submit; on the other hand, it could deepen the economic difficulties of Britain and France and strengthen their dependence on the US dollar and US oil, so that the United States could continue to control Britain and France, and take the opportunity to seize Britain's and France's oil interests and markets in the Middle East. This vicious method of the United States not only aroused Egypt's opposition but also angered the British and French ruling groups, who were bent on relying on the strength of the United States to maintain their colonial privileges.
    At this time, public opinion in various countries and in Britain and France generally demanded that the Suez Canal issue be brought to the Security Council for discussion. Britain and France suffered a serious setback in organizing the "Association of Canal Users" and were subjected to strong pressure from public opinion, and the hope of using the power of the United States to oppress Egypt became increasingly difficult to realize because of the sharp conflict of interests between the United States and Britain and France. In this desperate situation, in order to seize the initiative from the United States and avoid being controlled and manipulated by the United States, Britain and France, behind the back of the United States, decided to submit the Suez Canal issue to the United Nations. The purpose of Britain and France was to force the United States to support them in the Security Council and continue to carry out tricks against Egypt. They also wanted to prove through the Security Council that a peaceful resolution was impossible, so as to pave the way for their next actions. Although the United States was not satisfied with this action of Britain and France, in order to maintain the "unity" of the colonial countries, it had to express its agreement with the decision of Britain and France and support the British and French proposal for "international management" in the Security Council; however, the new tricks that Britain, France, and the United States played against Egypt in the Security Council failed.
    In the Security Council, Britain, France, and the United States colluded with each other, echoing each other and emphasizing "Western unity," clamoring that Egypt must accept the plan for "international management," but the atmosphere inside and outside the Security Council became increasingly unfavorable to the wishful thinking of the colonialists. The Soviet Union and Egypt advocated that the United Nations Charter must be observed, and that on the basis of respecting Egyptian sovereignty, Egypt should manage the canal, establish a cooperation system between Egypt and the user countries, and ensure freedom of navigation, so as to seek a peaceful solution. This just proposition was fully supported by Yugoslavia and won the sympathy and support of public opinion. The colonialists were very isolated and finally agreed to the six principles for resolving the Suez Canal issue in secret talks with Egypt.
    The six principles affirm the inviolable sovereignty of Egypt in managing the Suez Canal and provide a good basis for future fair and reasonable peaceful negotiations on the Suez Canal issue. Britain, France, and the United States later wanted to turn the six principles into a stepping stone for the colonialists to seize the canal in specific implementation, and demanded that the Security Council agree to the so-called "Eighteen-Nation Proposal" as a specific way to implement the six principles. This was an attempt to retreat back to their original position after having to take a step forward. But this request was vetoed by the Soviet Union. The Security Council ended with Egypt's victory.
    Of course, the struggle over the Suez Canal issue will still be sharp and tortuous. Britain, France, and the United States have all publicly stated that they will continue to adhere to the plan for "international control." Eden also publicly stated that he would not give up "using force." However, Egypt's just stance, with the support of the people all over the world, will surely achieve final victory.
    The British People Demand a Change of Policy
    Since the beginning of this year, due to the relaxation of the international situation and the development of the people's peace and democratic movement, politicians in Western European countries such as Britain, France, and Italy have begun to "look forward," seeing that wars cannot be fought in the hydrogen bomb era and that peaceful coexistence should be promoted. Therefore, they advocated promoting understanding between the East and the West and expressed that they would adopt independent and autonomous policies. The British-Soviet and French-Soviet talks promoted this trend that is conducive to peace. However, Britain and France have not adopted a far-sighted attitude towards the issue of national independence. They still fantasize about relying on the strength of the United States to maintain their colonial privileges, and therefore it is impossible to get rid of the shackles of the US cold war policy and power policy. This situation has been fully demonstrated in the development of the Suez Canal issue.
    However, the just struggle of the Egyptian people has proved that the national independence movement is irresistible, and the foolish practice of relying on the support of the United States to suppress the national independence movement can only invite the knife of the United States to stab in the back. As the London "Daily Worker" pointed out, Eden's attempt to undermine Egypt's independence has only further undermined Britain's independence. Therefore, the voice of the British people demanding a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue and a change in Britain's domestic and foreign policies is rising.
    The recent annual meetings of the British Trade Union Congress and the Labour Party also fully reflected this strong demand. Progressive demands from the vast number of trade union members and Labour Party members broke through the defense line of the right-wing leadership group, which often maintained policy consistency with the Conservative government, forcing the trade union and Labour Party annual meetings to pass some progressive resolutions, demanding that the Suez Canal issue be resolved through negotiations, changing the current "fiscal and economic measures" that tighten the people's belts, adopting independent and autonomous policies that conform to Britain's national interests, promoting relations between the East and the West, and freeing Britain from the heavy burden of arms expansion and war preparation in order to overcome Britain's current serious financial and economic difficulties.
    In this situation, the plans for the "Third Force" and the "European Federation," which are highly sung by Britain and other Western European countries, show that the internal contradictions of imperialism, which have been deepened on the basis of the colonial crisis, are trending towards surfaceization. The purpose of Britain's "Third Force Plan" is to "reduce its dependence on American policy and markets and try to closely link it with its European neighbors" in the face of the sharpening of "the increasing divergence between British foreign policy and American foreign policy and the economic struggle between the US dollar and the pound sterling." British Chancellor of the Exchequer Macmillan bluntly said: "A strong Europe" will be in a more favorable position in its relations with the United States. Dulles also admitted in a talk on October 2 that the "re-emergence" of the discussion of the "Third Force" and "European unification" was aimed at "not relying on the United States." He outwardly did not oppose "European unification" but openly expressed opposition to the trend of peaceful neutrality. However, the difficulties encountered by the United States' attempt to tightly bind its Western European partners to the war chariot are growing.
    Opposition to the Militarization of West Germany
    The political trend in Western Europe towards peace and independence and autonomy, and the crisis reflected by the "demilitarized development" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, cannot but affect the situation in West Germany.
    The commentary in the "New York Times" on October 5 reflects the anxiety of the United States and the West German ruling group. The commentary warned that the situation in West Germany will become the focus of world attention in addition to the Suez issue, because "new changes are taking place in the German situation that cannot guarantee Western unity and defense." The commentary said that the Adenauer government is encountering increasingly serious difficulties in rearmament and may lose its majority position in next year's elections. This danger will undermine the policy on which the West has built its "defense."
    This concern is not without foundation. In June of this year, when Adenauer held talks in Washington, he had already secretly planned a series of sinister plans to deal with this situation. On the one hand, the Adenauer government forced the Federal Parliament to pass the Conscription Law, openly conscripting former Nazi "SS," and began to build a "National Defense Force" of 500,000. In order to remove obstacles to rearmament, it brazenly declared the German Communist Party illegal, launched a large-scale attack on trade unions and democratic forces, and put pressure on the opposition parties. On the other hand, in order to shift its responsibility for deepening the division of Germany and obstructing German reunification onto the Soviet Union, it sent a note to the Soviet Union, re-proposing the already bankrupt unreasonable proposition of annexing Democratic Germany through "free elections." Subsequently, the United States, Britain, and France also sent similar notes to the Soviet Union to echo each other. But all these dangerous steps that threaten European peace can neither improve Adenauer's dangerous situation nor stop the continued development of West German peace and democratic forces.
    First of all, West German conscription was resisted by the people. The number of people enlisting was very small, and a large number of young people fled to East Germany. Adenauer's conscription of former "SS" officers to make up for the shortage of conscription has aroused widespread anger. The American "Time" magazine admitted that "it seems that the West German people do not want conscription because the collapse of the Nazis is still fresh in their minds." Thus, Adenauer had to decide to shorten the term of military service to twelve months, which made the North Atlantic Treaty Organization uneasy.
    Adenauer's government crisis is continuing to expand. The Free Democratic Party has withdrawn from the government alliance and demanded a fundamental change in Bonn's foreign policy. Recently, the West German Free Democratic Party also held talks with the East German Free Democratic Party to discuss the issue of German reunification. The Social Democratic Party also opposes Adenauer's policy and advocates "establishing a unified Germany that is militarily neutral and guaranteed by the Soviet Union and the West." All this reflects that the Adenauer group is becoming increasingly isolated and its position is becoming increasingly unstable.
    The strong development of the German Democratic Republic and its unremitting struggle to strive for the reunification of the motherland through negotiations between East and West Germany are having an increasing impact on West Germany. The United States and the Adenauer government's criminal policy of rearming West Germany and deepening the division of Germany cannot reverse the direction of the development of German peaceful, democratic reunification.
    The Confusion of American Foreign Policy
    The relaxation of the international situation, the development of the trend of peaceful coexistence and neutrality, and the advancement of the cause of peace, independence, and socialism by the people of all countries have powerfully struck at the US cold war and power policy. This policy has long aroused increasing dissatisfaction and criticism within the United States and among its allies. The call for "painfully reassessing" and changing American foreign policy is becoming louder and louder every day. However, the US ruling group, on the one hand, sees that the cold war and power policy are not working and has to begin to make some forced changes in the methods and tactics of implementing this policy, but at the same time they stubbornly want to continue to implement this unworkable policy. Therefore, the United States cannot but often be in a state of contradiction and confusion in its foreign policy.
    This situation cannot but be reflected in the recent highly publicized election in the United States. The election platforms adopted by the Democratic and Republican parties still repeat the cliches of the bankrupt "power policy" in foreign policy, continue to oppose our country's entry into the United Nations, maintain aggressive military alliances, maintain embargoes, and implement the so-called "liberation" policy of subverting people's democratic countries. However, whoever wants to win votes must take into account the voters' aversion to these lifeless old policies. Therefore, both parties have to flaunt "peace," make countless promises to voters, and attack each other's weaknesses.
    Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson attacked the Republican government for "losing the Cold War," causing the United States' prestige abroad to fall to "a level that has never been so low." Seeing the urgent demands of the people, he particularly seized on the government's war preparation policy and lashed out at it. His proposal to stop hydrogen bomb tests powerfully hit the Republican government's sore spot, forcing it to issue a public statement refusing to stop such tests. However, Stevenson still insisted on his own opinion, believing that "it is urgent to formulate a global policy to stop such tests as soon as possible," and he questioned the Republicans: "What are we waiting for now?" The reason why this issue is so prominent in the election is that the American people are increasingly uneasy about the threat of atomic war, but the United States is still expanding the atomic arms race.
    Eisenhower once again admitted in his campaign speech that "no one can win" in the nuclear weapons era, which is tantamount to admitting the bankruptcy of the US atomic blackmail policy. Although he said that the United States must actively work to bridge the gap separating the peoples of the East and the West, "without peace, there is no future." But when Eisenhower looked at the prospects for peace, he immediately showed unease. He admitted that the United States is facing some problems that "must be faced squarely," such as the anti-colonialist struggle, disarmament, the increasingly developed relations between socialist countries and neutral countries, and economic competition. These problems have been raised to the forefront of Western countries with increasing acuteness as peace has been strengthened. However, since the United States is unwilling to give up the "Cold War" and is unwilling to implement peaceful coexistence, Eisenhower cannot propose any solutions and therefore falls into a quandary.
    Many important American newspapers have expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the two parties have not put forward countermeasures to the crises encountered by the United States under the new international situation in their foreign policies, which is understandable. The United States is being left far behind by the times, and its unrealistic and rigid foreign policy is becoming increasingly outdated.

    最近国际形势的新发展
    顾思
    “八大”和中国对外关系
    刚刚闭幕的中国共产党第八次全国代表大会，揭开了中国历史的新的一页。这不仅是中国人民的历史性事件，也是国际生活中的一件大事。
    八大关于政治报告的决议确定我国在国际事务中的方针是：（一）继续巩固和加强同伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家的永恒的、牢不可破的兄弟友谊；（二）同赞成“五项原则”的亚洲、非洲国家和其他国家建立和发展友好关系；（三）同一切愿意同我国建立外交关系和经济文化关系的国家建立和发展正常的外交关系和经济文化关系；（四）继续反对在国际事务中使用武力和武力威胁政策，反对准备新战争的政策；（五）支持世界人民的和平运动，发展同各国人民的友好往来；（六）反对殖民主义，支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的一切反殖民主义和保卫民族主权的斗争；（七）支持各国工人阶级和劳动人民的社会主义运动，加强各国无产阶级的国际主义团结；（八）在同一切外国和外国人民的交往中，教育自己的工作人员采取真正平等对待的态度，严格反对大国主义。
    遵循这些正确的方针，几年来我国同世界各国之间的友好往来和联系，有了很大的发展，今后必将继续巩固和扩大。
    在八大前后期间，我国对外关系的开展，就是鼓舞人心的。参加今年我国国庆的，有来自五十多个国家的外宾两千多人，超过了过去历届国庆外宾参加的人数。印度尼西亚总统苏加诺、尼泊尔首相阿查里雅、巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底和缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努，以及印度国会代表团和军事代表团，先后访问我国，受到我国人民的热烈欢迎。在这以前，我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄访问印度、缅甸、巴基斯坦和印度尼西亚，同样受到这些国家的热烈接待。这是我国同已经与我国在五项原则基础上发展着友好关系的国家之间的友好往来，这种频繁的往来大大促进了友好关系的发展。
    我们还同其他的邻国结了新交。不久前，柬埔寨王国首相西哈努克和老挝王国首相富马先后访问了我国。最近我国已同叙利亚、也门建立了邦交，并将同锡兰互设外交代表。到现在为止，同我国建立了外交关系的国家已有二十九个，人口达十亿以上。
    我国同各国的贸易、文化和民间的往来，也大大发展了。现在同我国进行贸易的，已有六十多个国家了。
    此外，我国同西欧、拉丁美洲国家各方面开展的广泛接触和联系，也是一个值得珍视的发展。
    我国的对外联系正在大大扩大，我国的国际地位正在大大提高，凡是珍重现实的人，都无不承认中国在国际事务中应该占据它应有的地位。但是直到现在为止，还有人仍在竭力想抹煞中华人民共和国的存在和它在国际上无可争辩的合法地位，甚至幻想制造“两个中国”。但是，这一类活动，除了损害他们自己以外，是得不到别的结果的。
    从苏联的大丰收说起
    今年苏联的谷物生产得到了历史上最大一次丰收。各地农庄向国家交售的粮食大大超过了国家计划，哈萨克共和国交售的粮食，比在大规模开垦荒地以前十一年中所交粮食的总和还要多。苏联的谷物大丰收，可以满足苏联人民对谷物的一切基本需要，可以使国家有更多的粮食储备，可以更好地支援工业建设和发展牧畜，同时还可以增加粮食的出口。今年苏联的谷物大丰收，是苏联发展农业的巨大胜利，这个胜利是苏联采取急速发展农业措施、大量开垦荒地（已开垦了三千五百五十万公顷）的结果。苏联大规模发展农业的计划，曾被一些西方资产阶级报刊讥讽为“赌博”和“幻想”，但是这次丰收表明新五年计划所规定的庞大的农业增产计划，不但可以完全实现，而且还可以超额完成。
    整个社会主义阵营国家的经济发展，都呈现一片蓬勃气象。今年，苏联和欧洲人民民主国家，除保加利亚以外，都开始了更大规模的新五年计划的建设，要把工业总产量提高50％至60％以上，农业产量提高20％以上至70％。今年上半年完成计划的情况，极为良好。我国人民也在争取超额完成第一个五年计划。同时，中国共产党第八次全国代表大会已提出了第二个五年计划的建议，要求在1962年把工农业总产值比1957年增加75％左右。正在艰苦条件下进行恢复工作的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国，也取得了卓越成就。朝鲜人民已经提前完成了三年计划。
    在经济建设巨大发展的基础上，社会主义国家之间新型的互助合作关系，正在进一步加强和发展。它们相互之间的友好往来也更加频繁。
    社会主义国家的强大发展和互助合作，是我们这个时代的最生动最重要的特征。
    与此同时，社会主义国家的对外关系也日益扩大和发展。特别显著的是许多人民民主国家参加了联合国后，在国际事务中的作用大大提高了。苏联和人民民主国家同亚非国家间友好合作关系，有了新的发展。东西方的经济贸易关系开辟着宽广的远景。1955年苏联对外贸易已比战前增加了三倍多，而同期资本主义世界对外贸易只增加了60％。在世界贸易中，苏联已从第十六位提高到了第六位。欧洲人民民主国家今年以来也同各国订了二十多个贸易协定。这种联系和往来，扩大了社会主义国家的国际影响，成为加强和平和国际合作的重要因素。
      苏日谈判达成协议
    社会主义国家和其他各国人民争取国际关系正常发展的努力，不断取得了新的成就。新近在莫斯科举行的苏日两国关于恢复正常关系的谈判，已经达成了协议。两国发表了联合宣言，决定两国之间的战争状态宣告结束，重新建立和平和睦邻的关系，并互换大使级外交代表。这是有利于日本走向独立自主、有利于世界和平事业的重要事件。
    苏日谈判已历时一年多，一共进行了四次谈判。去年6月举行的第一次会谈，双方就已对和约的基本条款取得了一致，原来是没有理由不能达成协议的。但是美国和日本的亲美派拿领土问题作梗，中断了会谈。今年5月，苏日渔业条约谈判取得结果，规定条约要在和约签订或正常关系建立后生效，这又促成了第三次会谈。在第三次会谈中，日本出席谈判的全权代表重光葵当时也认为，和约可以签字了。但是，由于美国的压力和日本政府内部的激烈争吵，使会谈又陷入停顿状态。这时，美国反动派看到大势愈益对己不利，竟毫不遮掩地进行干涉和破坏活动。杜勒斯公开威胁说，如果日本不对苏坚持领土要求，美国将并吞琉球群岛。日本亲美派也大肆活动，要求永远中止日苏谈判，并策动倒鸠山的台。可是，日本人民展开了要求立即同苏联恢复正常关系的强大运动，给了美日反动派以有力的反击，促成了日本统治集团的剧烈分化。以恢复对苏、中邦交为政治资本上台的鸠山集团，看到争取谈判成功的条件已经成熟，如果再要拖延，将使自己的政治地位陷于危险，于是他克服了各方面的阻挠，决定以先恢复邦交，领土问题留待将来谈判的方式，亲自到莫斯科去同苏联进行谈判。
    一年多来苏日谈判的过程，贯穿着苏联政府的真诚努力，和日本人民反对美国的干涉、反对日本亲美派的阻挠、争取独立自主的尖锐斗争。日本人民对苏日谈判结果感到极大兴奋。公众舆论普遍要求日本应该开始采取新的独立自主的外交政策，要求促进中日关系的正常化。美国和日本亲美派当然是不高兴的，而且必然会千方百计地加以阻挠。但是，事实证明，日本民主进步力量和一切爱国者的团结斗争，是能击败美日反动派损害日本利益和独立主权的罪恶活动的。
    埃及的胜利
    埃及收回苏伊士运河公司的英勇斗争，在全世界爱好和平的人民的支持下，初步获得了重大胜利。英、法、美三国在武力干涉政策遭到世界舆论反对以后，不得不在9月23日把苏伊士运河问题提交联合国安全理事会。10月13日，安全理事会通过了以尊重埃及主权为基础的六项原则，给和平谈判创造了条件。
    在“杜勒斯计划”被埃及拒绝、孟席斯五人委员会的“劝降”遭到失败以后，英、法、美殖民主义者更加凶恶地秘密制定了强夺运河的“使用国协会”计划。实行这个计划，势必导致武力干涉，在中东造成不可收拾的局面。这个计划不仅引起了埃及人民的极大愤慨，并且引起了各国舆论的齐声谴责。印度尼赫鲁总理指责这个计划包含战争危险。中苏两国政府更先后发表声明，表示对这个挑衅行为不能袖手旁观，置若罔闻。
    世界舆论的这种强大的压力，使得9月间为成立“使用国协会”而举行的伦敦会议，一开始就陷于混乱状态。原来支持“杜勒斯计划”的许多国家，都对“使用国协会”采取冷淡态度，不赞成使用武力，要求同埃及谈判。结果，会议不得不草草收场，连会议发表的宣言和其他文件，各国也没有签字。后来，“使用国协会”虽然成立了，但巴基斯坦、埃塞俄比亚、日本三国拒绝正式参加，其他许多国家也提出了保留条件。伦敦会议的结果表明对埃及的恐吓、威胁和暴力政策是不现实的。
    在这次伦敦会议上，英、法、美之间的矛盾更加表面化了。美国在伦敦会议上充分暴露了两面三刀的态度。一方面它给英、法想出“使用国协会”的办法，同英、法一起胁迫埃及，企图侵犯埃及的主权。另一方面它又假充好人，表示不支持英、法使用武力，企图把自己装扮成不是殖民主义者。同时，它又提出抵制运河、绕道好望角航行、对埃及进行经济制裁的主张。这是一个一箭双雕的极其阴险的打算。美国企图用这个办法，一方面对埃及施加压力，挑拨埃及同其他阿拉伯国家和亚非国家之间的关系，使埃及处于孤立，以便迫使埃及屈服；另一方面它又可以加深英、法经济上的困难，加强它们对美元和美国石油的依赖性，以便美国继续控制英、法，并乘机夺取英、法在中东的石油利益和市场。美国这种毒辣的手法，不仅引起了埃及的反对，也激怒了一心想依靠美国力量保持殖民主义特权的英、法统治集团。
    这时，各国和英、法国内的舆论普遍要求将苏伊士运河问题提到安理会讨论。英、法在组织“使用国协会”上受到严重挫折，又受到舆论的强大压力，而借美国的势头压迫埃及的希望，又因为美国同英、法之间尖锐的利害矛盾而越来越难实现。在这种走投无路的情况下，英、法为了从美国手里夺取主动，避免再受美国的控制和操纵，便背着美国，决定把苏伊士运河问题提交联合国。英、法的目的是想在安理会上迫使美国支持它们，继续对埃及施行诡计。它们还想通过安理会证明和平解决不可能，好替它们的下一步行动开路。美国虽然对英、法这个行动不满意，可是为了保持殖民国家的“团结”，不得不表示同意英、法的决定，并在安理会上支持英、法关于“国际管理”的建议；但是英、法、美在安理会上对埃及施展的新诡计落空了。
    在安理会上，英、法、美勾结在一起，此唱彼和地强调“西方团结”，叫嚷埃及必须接受“国际管理”的计划，但是，安理会内外的气氛都更加不利于殖民主义者的如意算盘。苏联和埃及主张必须遵守联合国宪章，在尊重埃及主权的基础上，以埃及管理运河，建立埃及同使用国的合作制度，保证通航自由，来谋求和平解决。这个公正的主张得到南斯拉夫的全力支持，赢得了舆论的同情和拥护。殖民主义者十分孤立，终于在同埃及举行的秘密会谈中同意解决苏伊士运河问题的六项原则。
    六项原则确认了埃及管理苏伊士运河的不可侵犯的主权，为今后公平合理和平解决苏伊士运河问题的谈判提供了良好的基础。英、法、美后来想使六项原则在具体实施上变为殖民主义者夺取运河的垫脚石，要求安理会同意所谓“十八国建议”是实施六项原则的具体办法。这是想在不得不进了一步以后又重新退回它们原来的地方。但这个要求被苏联否决了。安理会以埃及的胜利而结束。
    当然，苏伊士运河问题上的斗争还将是尖锐的、曲折的。英、法、美都公开声言还要坚持“国际管制”的计划。艾登还公开表示不放弃“使用武力”。但是，埃及的正义立场在全世界人民的支持下，一定会取得最后的胜利。
    英国人民要求改变政策
    今年以来，由于国际局势的缓和，人民和平民主运动的发展，英、法、意等西欧国家的政治家曾开始“向前看”，看到氢弹时代战争打不得，应该和平共处，因而主张促进东西方的谅解，表示要采取独立自主的政策。英苏、法苏会谈，促进了这一有利于和平的趋势。但是，英、法在对待民族独立问题上没有采取有远见的态度。它们仍然幻想依靠美国的力量来保持殖民主义特权，因而也就不可能摆脱美国冷战政策和实力政策的束缚。这种情况在苏伊士运河问题的发展中充分表现出来了。
    但是，埃及人民的正义斗争证明，民族独立运动是不可抗拒的，想依靠美国的支持来镇压民族独立运动的愚蠢作法，只能招致美国的刀子从背后刺进来。正如伦敦“工人日报”所指出的，艾登企图破坏埃及的独立，结果却只是更多地破坏了英国的独立。因此，英国人民要求和平解决苏伊士运河问题、改变英国的对内对外政策的呼声日益高涨起来。
    最近先后举行的英国职工大会年会和工党年会，也充分反映了这一强烈要求。来自广大的工会会员和工党党员的进步要求，冲破了右翼领导集团经常同保守党政府保持政策上一致的防线，迫使工会和工党年会通过了一些进步决议，要求以谈判方式解决苏伊士运河问题，改变束紧人民腰带的现行“财政经济措施”，采取符合于英国的民族利益的独立自主政策，促进东西方的关系，使英国摆脱扩军备战的沉重负担，以克服英国当前财政经济的严重困难。
    在这种情况下，英国和其他西欧国家高唱入云的“第三种力量”和“欧洲联邦”的计划，就表明在殖民主义危机的基础上加深了的帝国主义内部矛盾，正在趋向表面化。英国的“第三种力量计划”的目的，是想在“英国外交政策和美国外交政策的日益分歧以及美元和英镑之间的经济斗争”尖锐化的情况下，“减少它对美国政策和市场的依赖，设法密切它同欧洲邻邦的关系。”英国财政大臣麦克米伦露骨地说：“强有力的欧洲”将在同美国的关系上处于较为有利的地位。杜勒斯在10月2日的谈话，也承认“第三种力量”、“欧洲统一”的议论的“再次出现”，目的是“想不依赖美国”。他表面上不反对“欧洲统一”，却公开表示反对和平中立趋势。但是，美国仍想把它的西欧伙伴们牢牢地缚在战车上的作法，遇到的困难是愈来愈大了。
    反对西德军国主义化
    西欧争取和平和独立自主的政治趋势，北大西洋公约组织“非军事化的发展”所反映的危机，不能不影响到西德的局势。
    10月5日“纽约时报”的评论，反映了美国和西德统治集团的焦虑不安。评论警告说，西德局势将在苏伊士问题以外成为举世注目的焦点，因为“德国局势正在发生不能保证西方团结和防务的新的变化。”评论说，阿登纳政府在重整军备上遭到越来越严重的困难，并有可能在明年选举中失掉多数地位，这种危险，将破坏西方据此建立“防务”的政策。
    这种忧虑不是没有根据的。今年6月，阿登纳到华盛顿会谈时，就已密谋了一连串对付这种局势的阴险计划。阿登纳政府一方面强使联邦议会通过征兵法，公开征召前纳粹“党卫军”，开始建立五十万的“国防军”，并且为了扫除重新武装的障碍，竟悍然宣布德国共产党非法，大举向工会和民主力量进攻，对反对党施加压力。另一方面为了把它加深德国分裂、阻挠德国统一的罪责，转嫁到苏联的身上，向苏联提出照会，重新提出早已破产了的所谓经由“自由选举”并吞民主德国的无理主张。接着，美、英、法也向苏联提出了相似的照会，以相策应。但是这一切威胁欧洲和平的危险步骤，既不能改善阿登纳的危险境遇，也不能阻止西德和平民主力量的继续发展。
    首先，西德征兵就遭到人民的抗拒，入伍的人数寥寥无几，大批青年逃入东德。阿登纳征召前“党卫军”军官入伍，借以弥补征兵的不足，更引起普遍的愤怒。美国“时代”周刊承认，“事情看来是西德人民不要征兵，因为对纳粹的崩溃记忆犹新。”这样，阿登纳不得不决定把兵役期缩短为十二个月，使北大西洋公约组织感到不安。
    阿登纳的政府危机正在继续扩大。自由民主党已退出了政府联盟，要求根本改变波恩的外交政策。最近西德自由民主党还同东德自由民主党举行了会谈，讨论德国统一问题。社会民主党也反对阿登纳的政策，主张“建立一个由苏联和西方的保证所保障的在军事上中立的统一的德国”。这都反映出阿登纳集团正日益孤立，它的地位日益不稳。
    德意志民主共和国的强大发展和它争取东西德谈判统一祖国的不懈斗争，对西德影响日益增强。美国和阿登纳政府重新武装西德和加深德国分裂的罪恶政策，决不能扭转德国和平民主统一的发展方向。
    美国外交政策的混乱
    国际局势的缓和，和平共处的中立趋势的发展，各国人民争取和平、独立和社会主义事业的推进，都有力地打击了美国的冷战和实力政策。这个政策早已引起了美国国内和它的同盟国家越来越大的不满和批评。“必须忍痛重新估计”和改变美国外交政策的呼声，一天比一天响亮起来。但是，美国统治集团一方面眼看到冷战和实力政策的行不通，不得不开始在推行这个政策的方法和策略上被迫作些改变，但是它们同时又顽固地要继续推行这个行不通的政策。因此，美国在外交政策上不能不经常处于矛盾和混乱之中。
    这种情况，在最近美国大吹大擂的竞选中也不能不反映出来。民主党和共和党通过的竞选政纲，在外交政策上都仍然重复破了产的“实力政策”的滥调，继续反对我国进入联合国，保持侵略性军事联盟，维持禁运，实行颠覆人民民主国家的所谓“解放”政策。但是，谁要获得选票，他就必须估计到选民对他们这些死气沉沉的老政策的厌恶。于是，两党都不能不标榜“和平”，对选民许下无数的诺言，并互相攻击对方的弱点。
    民主党总统候选人史蒂文森，攻击共和党政府在“冷战中失利”，使美国国外威信降到“从来未曾如此低落”的程度。他看到人民的迫切要求，特别抓住政府备战政策，大加鞭挞。他的停止氢弹试验的主张，有力地打中了共和党政府的痛处，迫得它公开发表声明，拒绝停止这种试验。但是，史蒂文森仍旧坚持己见，认为“尽早制订一种制止这种试验的世界性政策是迫不及待的事情”，他质问共和党：“我们现在还等什么？”这个问题之所以在竞选中显得这样突出，是因为美国人民对原子战争的威胁日益感到不安，而美国却仍在扩大原子军备竞赛。
    艾森豪威尔在竞选演说中再一次承认，在核子武器时代“谁也不能取得胜利”，这就等于承认美国原子讹诈政策的破产。他虽然表示美国必须积极努力填平隔开东西方人民的鸿沟，“没有和平，就没有将来”。但是当艾森豪威尔瞻望一下和平远景的时候，又立刻表现了惶惶不安。他承认，美国正面临着“必须正视”的一些问题，如反殖民主义斗争、裁军、社会主义国家和中立国家关系日益发展和经济竞赛等问题。这些问题已随和平的加强而日益尖锐地提到了西方国家的面前。可是，由于美国不愿放弃“冷战”，不愿实行和平共处，所以艾森豪威尔不可能提出什么解决的办法，因此陷于一筹莫展之中。
    美国许多重要报纸对两党在外交政策上没有为美国对国际新形势下遭到的危机提出对策，表示不满，这是可以理解的。美国正被远远抛在时代的后面，它的不现实的僵硬外交政策是越来越过时了。
