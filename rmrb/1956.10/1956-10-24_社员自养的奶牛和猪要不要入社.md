    Should Members' Self-Raised Cows and Pigs Be Entered into the Cooperative?
    Question: I live in Huaide County, Jilin Province. My father-in-law has two dairy cows, which he uses for household sideline production. However, the township head and the cooperative director have repeatedly urged him to put these two dairy cows into the cooperative; he couldn't refuse, so he put the cows in. Here, many people are also saying that "even New Year pigs must be entered into the cooperative." Therefore, everyone is selling pigs on a large scale. My family is no exception. We used to raise more than twenty pigs, but now we've sold all but four. Are the township cadres' actions and people's statements correct? Aren't dairy cows means of subsistence? Why should means of subsistence also be entered into the cooperative?　Guo Chang
    Answer: Members are allowed to engage in household sideline production. Agricultural cooperatives should also encourage and help members engage in household sideline production. Since self-raised dairy cows are your father-in-law's sideline, he can continue to manage them himself. If the agricultural production cooperative where he lives also uses dairy farming as a cooperative sideline production, and the conditions for collective dairy farming are better than self-raising, and it is beneficial to both the cooperative and himself to have the dairy cows enter the cooperative, the agricultural cooperative can also mobilize your father-in-law to put the dairy cows into the cooperative under the principle of fair and reasonable pricing. Of course, if your father-in-law is unwilling, the agricultural cooperative should not use "mobilization" as a pretext to force him.
    Raising pigs is the most convenient sideline for members' families to manage themselves. Agricultural cooperatives should encourage and help members raise more pigs. Agricultural cooperatives can also collectively raise pigs. If members are willing, they can also assign a price to their self-raised pigs and let the collective cooperative raise them. One cannot prevent members from raising pigs just because the cooperative wants to collectively raise pigs. As long as the feed and members' labor time are properly allocated, there is no contradiction between the cooperative raising pigs and members raising pigs individually. The statement that "even New Year pigs must be entered into the cooperative" is wrong and may be a rumor. You should tell the farmers in your township not to be fooled by rumors and not to sell all the piglets. Selling piglets reduces income and is detrimental to oneself.
    Dairy cows used as sideline production are not means of subsistence. Even pigs raised for one's own consumption are considered production during the feeding process and are not considered means of subsistence. Whether dairy cows and pigs should be entered into the cooperative is not a question of whether they are means of production or means of subsistence. If they are means of subsistence, of course they should not be entered into the cooperative; if they are means of production, they do not necessarily have to be entered into the cooperative. Advanced agricultural production cooperatives do not need and should not require members to put all their means of production into the cooperative, only land, draught animals, large farm implements, and other major means of production. This is clearly stated in Article 13 of the "Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives."

### 社员自养的奶牛和猪要不要入社

    社员自养的奶牛和猪要不要入社
    问：我家住在吉林省怀德县。我岳父有两头奶牛，是他做家庭副业生产用的。可是，乡长和社主任等人再三动员他把这二头奶牛入社；他不好推却，也就把奶牛入了社。这里还有很多人说“过年猪也得入社”。因此，现在家家大肆卖猪。我家也不例外，过去养二十多口猪，现在卖的只剩四口了。乡干部他们这种做法、人们这种说法是否正确？奶牛不是生活资料吗？为什么生活资料也要入社？　郭　昌
    答：社员是可以经营家庭副业的。农业社对社员经营家庭副业还应当加以鼓励和帮助。自养奶牛既然是你岳父的副业，他是可以自己继续经营的。如果他所在的农业生产合作社也以养奶牛作为社的副业生产，集体养奶牛的条件比自养好，奶牛入社对社对自己都有利，在作价公平合理的原则下，农业社动员你岳父把奶牛入社也是可以的。当然，你岳父不愿意，农业社是不应当以“动员”为名而加以强迫的。
    养猪，是最便于社员家庭自己经营的副业。农业合作社应该鼓励和帮助社员多多养猪。农业社也可以集体养猪。社员如果愿意，也可以把自养的猪作价归社集体喂养。不能因为社里要集体养猪就不叫社员养猪。只要对饲料和社员劳动时间支配得恰当，社里养猪和社员个人养猪是没有矛盾的。“过年猪也要入社”的说法是错误的，可能是一种谣传。应该告诉你乡的农民不要上谣传的当，千万不要把小猪都卖掉了。卖了小猪，减少了收入，吃亏的是自己。
    作为副业生产的奶牛不是生活资料。就是喂养供自己吃的猪，在喂养过程中，也是作为生产来进行的，不算生活资料。奶牛和猪应不应该入社，问题不在于它们是生产资料，还是生活资料。是生活资料，当然不应入社；是生产资料，也不一定要入社。高级农业生产合作社并不需要也不应当把社员所有的生产资料都入社，只需要把土地、耕畜、大型农具等主要生产资料入社。这在“高级农业生产合作社示范章程”第十三条说得很清楚。
