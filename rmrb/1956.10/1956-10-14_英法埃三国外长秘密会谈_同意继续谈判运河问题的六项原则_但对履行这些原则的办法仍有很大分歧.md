Xinhua News Agency, 13th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations Security Council held a closed meeting on the afternoon of October 12, at which it heard a report on the secret talks between the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Egypt.

    UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld announced at the meeting that Britain, France, and Egypt had unanimously agreed that negotiations on the Suez Canal issue would continue on the basis of six principles. These six principles are:

    "(1) There should be free and open transit through the Canal without overt or covert discrimination. (As clarification, this principle applies to the extent that the corresponding principle of the Convention of Constantinople applies, namely, in technical and political aspects, and point three below is also related to these aspects.)

    (2) The sovereignty of Egypt will be respected.

    (3) The operation of the Canal will be free from the politics of any country.

    (4) The manner of fixing tolls and charges shall be decided by agreement between Egypt and the users.

    (5) A fair proportion of the tolls shall be devoted to development.

    (6) Unresolved issues between the Suez Canal Company and the Egyptian government, once disputes arise, should be resolved through arbitration with appropriate jurisdiction and appropriate provisions regarding the payment of amounts due."

    However, it can be seen from the attitudes expressed by some representatives at and outside the meeting that significant differences still exist on how to implement these principles.

    French Foreign Minister Pineau, who chaired the Security Council meeting, said that the secret talks between Britain, France, and Egypt had "made great progress, and we have reached agreement on six principles," but "as far as the method of implementing these principles is concerned, the three countries have not made much progress."

    British Foreign Secretary Lloyd said that the secret talks had made some progress, but the views of the two sides were still far apart. He said that maintaining the Canal as an "international waterway" was a "non-negotiable matter of principle," and Britain still believed that the eighteen-nation plan to stipulate "international control" of the Canal was the best way to resolve the Suez issue.

    Egyptian representative Sabri said that, from the point of view of his delegation, no agreement had been reached so far.

    The UN Secretariat announced that the Security Council would hold an open meeting on October 13.

    英法埃三国外长秘密会谈
    同意继续谈判运河问题的六项原则
    但对履行这些原则的办法仍有很大分歧
    新华社13日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会10月12日下午举行了秘密会议，会上听取了关于英、法、埃及三国外交部长秘密会谈的情况的报告。
    联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在会上宣布，英、法、埃及三国已经一致同意关于苏伊士运河问题的谈判将在六项原则上继续进行。这六项原则是：
    “（一）可以自由和公开地通过运河而没有公开的或隐蔽的歧视。（作为澄清，这个原则适用于像君士坦丁堡公约的相应原则所适用的范围，即适用于技术和政治方面，下面第三点也同这些方面有关。）
    （二）埃及的主权将受到尊重。
    （三）运河的经营将同任何国家的政治不发生关系。
    （四）规定通行税和费用的方式将由埃及同使用国所达成的协议来决定。
    （五）通行税中的相当部分将拨作发展之用。
    （六）一旦发生纠纷，苏伊士运河公司同埃及政府之间的未解决的问题应当在有适当的职权范围和关于支付应当支付的款项的适当规定的情况下通过仲裁加以解决。”
    但是，从一些代表在会上和会外表明的态度中可以看出，在如何履行这些原则的问题上仍然存在着很大的分歧。
    主持安全理事会会议的法国外交部长比诺说，英、法、埃及三国秘密会谈“获得了巨大的进展，我们已经对六项原则达成了协议”，但是，“就履行这些原则的办法而论，三国还没有取得很大的进展”。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德说，秘密会谈已经取得某些进展，但是双方的意见仍然有很大的距离。他说，保持运河为一条“国际水道”是“不能妥协的原则问题”，英国仍然认为规定“国际管制”运河的十八国计划是解决苏伊士问题的最好办法。
    埃及代表萨布里说，从他的代表团的观点来说，到现在为止并没有达成协议。
    联合国秘书处宣布，安全理事会在10月13日将举行公开会议。
