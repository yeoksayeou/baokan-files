Xinhua News Agency, October 10th – The Hungarian Instrument Trading Company will hold a Hungarian Laboratory Equipment Technology Exhibition in Beijing starting on the 11th, along with scientific lectures.

The technical exhibition includes more than 70 relatively new types of instruments on the world market, divided into four sections: metal material testing instruments, agricultural testing instruments, soil testing instruments, and fuel and lubricating oil testing instruments.

About 40 of the exhibited instruments will be available for operational demonstrations to the audience.

The exhibition is scheduled to last for three weeks. During the exhibition, Hungarian experts in Beijing will also give 14 special lectures related to the exhibition to Chinese experts and scientific and technical personnel, and will conduct discussions with Chinese experts. All the lecturers are academicians of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and university professors.

This newspaper reports: The Hungarian Consumer Goods Exhibition is scheduled to open today at the Beijing Municipal Laboring People's Cultural Palace.

This small but exquisitely arranged exhibition displays more than 3,000 exhibits, including radio equipment, sports and cultural goods, children's toys, practical aluminum products, knitwear, ready-made clothing, and leather goods. Some consumer goods produced by the Hungarian machine manufacturing industry will be of great interest to visitors. Here, people can see some very ingenious radio designs. There is a portable radio that can be carried around, making it very convenient for travel and vacations. There is also a radio with a clock installed on it, which can replace an ordinary alarm clock. Just turn the hour hand to the desired time, and the radio will make a sound to wake up its owner.

The children's toys on display are also very eye-catching. There are all kinds of automatic trains and cars, dolls, building blocks, and small animals made of plastic, all made very exquisitely.

This exhibition does not reflect the full picture of Hungary's light industrial production. It only displays products from Hungary's light industrial production that have a considerable surplus in addition to meeting domestic needs. The purpose of the exhibition is to enable Chinese trade departments to understand these products, so that Chinese trade organizations can conduct exchanges based on domestic consumption needs and the possibility of providing products. This exchange will not be included in the trade agreements already signed between the two countries.

The target audience for this exhibition is mainly experts and staff from Chinese commercial departments. It will be exhibited in China for three to four weeks.

    匈牙利在北京举办两个展览会
    新华社10日讯　匈牙利仪器贸易公司11日起在京举办匈牙利实验室设备技术展览，同时举行科学讲座。
    技术展览包括七十多种在世界市场中比较新式的仪器，分为金属材料试验仪器、农业试验仪器、土壤试验仪器、燃料和润滑油料试验仪器等四个部分。
    展出的仪器中约有四十件可向观众进行操作表演。
    展览预定举行三星期。在展览期间，匈牙利在北京的专家们还要向中国的专家和科学技术人员作十四个同这次展览有关的专题讲演，并且要同中国专家进行讨论。担任讲演的都是匈牙利科学院院士和大学教授。
    本报讯　匈牙利消费品展览会定于今天在北京市劳动人民文化宫开幕。
    这个规模不大、但布置精致的展览会共展出了大小约三千多件展品。其中包括无线电器材、体育和文化用品、儿童玩具、实用的铝制品、针织品、现成服装和皮革制品等。会上展出的、由匈牙利机器制造工业部门所出产的一些消费品，将会引起参观者的极大兴趣。人们在这里可以看到一些设计得十分灵巧的收音机。有一种手提收音机可以随身携带，旅行和休假应用十分便利。另有一种收音机上面还安装有时钟，它可以代替普通的闹钟。只要把时针拨到所需要的钟点，到时候收音机就会发出声音来唤醒它的主人。
    会上展出的儿童玩具也很引人注意。这里有各式各样的自动火车和汽车，洋娃娃，积木，用塑料做成的小动物等，制作得十分精巧。
    这个展览会并没有反映出匈牙利轻工业生产的全貌。它所陈列的只是匈牙利轻工业生产中除了满足国内需要外还有相当剩余的产品。展览会的目的是使中国的贸易部门了解这些产品，以便中国的贸易机构根据国内的消费需要和提供产品的可能来进行交换。这种交换将不包括在两国之间已签订的贸易协定之内。
    这个展览会的对象主要是中国商业部门的专家和工作人员。它将在中国展出三、四个星期。
