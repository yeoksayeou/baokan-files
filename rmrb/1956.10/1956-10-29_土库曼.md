    Turkmenistan
    On October 27, 1924, the people of all ethnic groups in Turkmenistan overthrew the Tsarist rule and established the Soviet Socialist Republic, joining the Soviet Union. In these thirty-two years, Turkmenistan has transformed from one of the most backward regions into a country with socialist industry and collectivized agriculture. The Karakum Desert, which accounts for more than three-quarters of the country's territory, is shrinking year by year, turning into green grasslands that symbolize abundance and prosperity.
    The Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic is located in Central Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea to the west, the Kazakh and Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republics to the east and north, and Iran and Afghanistan to the south. It covers an area of 488,000 square kilometers and has a population of 1.4 million (according to statistics from April 1956). The capital is Ashgabat.
    In several five-year plans, Turkmenistan has established more than 350 large industrial enterprises equipped with the latest technology and new industrial sectors such as chemical, oil extraction, oil processing, ship repair, textile and silk weaving. Many sulfur factories have been built in the center of the Karakum Desert. Industrial output is increasing year by year.
    Fundamental changes have also taken place in agriculture. In the Tsarist era, primitive methods were used for cultivation. Now, more than 9,500 tractors and 35,000 various agricultural machines and tools are working in the fields of Turkmen collective farms. Cotton planting is the main sector of Turkmen agriculture, and the harvest of seed cotton has increased more than four times compared to pre-revolutionary times. Turkmen small grapes and juicy and sweet melons are also very famous.
    Water is the most precious thing in desert areas; wherever water appears, prosperity follows. During the Soviet era, the people of Turkmenistan have made great achievements in the struggle for water, building canals such as the Bashaag-Kirkin, Karabekur, Kur-Arek, and North Yabusk, and reservoirs such as Tashkiprin, Bint Collective Farm, and Dejean, forming a new irrigation system network.
    After the revolution, Turkmenistan established a high level of culture with national form and socialist content. Before the revolution, only seven out of every thousand people were literate, and there were only fifty-eight ordinary schools, which were only accessible to the children of merchants, officials, khans, and large landowners. There were no institutions of higher learning or secondary technical schools. Now, a seven-year universal education system has been implemented throughout the country, with 1,186 ordinary schools, six institutions of higher learning, and thirty-seven secondary technical schools. The total number of students at all levels of schools is approximately 250,000. Turkmenistan also has an Academy of Sciences and thirty-eight scientific research institutions.
    In the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), the total output of Turkmenistan's entire industry will increase by approximately 60%, of which the total output of the republic's industry will increase by 80%. The most important tasks in agriculture are to fully develop cotton planting and animal husbandry, and to vigorously expand the irrigated area and transform the Karakum Desert. The Karakum Canal, which is one of the largest water conservancy projects in Turkmenistan and the Soviet Union, is currently being carried out simultaneously from both ends and will converge in the depths of the desert during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. This canal is 950 kilometers long and approximately 100 meters wide, and after completion, it will irrigate 250,000 hectares of cotton fields. These cotton fields will produce 150,000 tons of high-quality fiber cotton annually. Tens of thousands of hectares of grassland will appear in the desert, becoming pastures for the famous Turkmen Karakul sheep. Many orange groves, lemon groves, and mulberry forests will also appear on both sides of the canal. In addition, the first phase of the Sary-Yazhen Reservoir and the Second Dejean Reservoir will be completed during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. Zhang Ye (with picture)

    土库曼
    1924年10月27日，土库曼斯坦各族人民推翻了沙皇统治，成立苏维埃社会主义共和国，并且加入苏联。在这三十二年当中，土库曼已经从一个最落后的地区变成一个有社会主义工业和集体化农业的国家了。占全国领土面积四分之三以上的卡拉库姆沙漠正在一年比一年地减少，而变成标志着丰饶和富足的绿色草原。
    土库曼苏维埃社会主义共和国位于中亚细亚，西至里海，东面和北面同哈萨克和乌兹别克两个加盟共和国交界，南边同伊朗和阿富汗交界。领土面积四十八万八千平方公里，人口一百四十万人（根据1956年4月统计数字）。首都是阿什哈巴德。
    在几个五年计划中，土库曼已经建立起三百五十多个有最新技术装备的大工业企业和化学、石油开采、石油加工、船只修理、纺织和丝织等新的工业部门。卡拉库姆沙漠的中心建立了许多硫磺工厂。工业产量在一年比一年地增加。
    农业方面也发生了根本的变化。在沙皇时代都是用原始方法耕作。现在，土库曼集体农庄的田野上已经有九千五百多台拖拉机和三万五千多部各种农业机器和工具在工作。植棉业是土库曼农业的主要部门，同革命前相比，籽棉的收获量增加了四倍多。土库曼的小葡萄和多汁而香甜的香瓜也是很出名的。
    水在沙漠地区是最宝贵的东西，哪儿出现了水，哪儿就会繁荣起来。在苏维埃政权年代，土库曼的人民在争取水的斗争中得到了很大的成绩，建成了巴沙格—基尔金、卡拉别库尔、库尔—阿雷克、北雅布斯克等运河和塔什基普林、宾特集体农庄和德詹等水库，组成了一个新的灌溉系统网。
    革命以后土库曼建立了民族形式和社会主义内容的高度文化。革命前每一千个人当中仅仅有七个人识字，只有五十八个普通学校，商人、官吏、可汗和大地主的子弟才能上学。没有一所高等学校和中等技术学校。现在，全国都实行了七年制普遍教育，有一千一百八十六所普通学校、六所高等学校和三十七所中等技术学校。各级学校的学生总共约有二十五万人。土库曼还有一所科学院和三十八所科学研究机关。
    在第六个五年计划（1956—1960年）中，土库曼整个工业的总产量约增加60％，其中共和国工业总产量增加80％。农业方面最重要的任务是全力发展植棉业和畜牧业，并且大力扩大灌溉面积，改造卡拉库姆沙漠。卡拉库姆运河是土库曼也是苏联最大的水利工程之一，目前正从两端同时进行，将在第六个五年计划期间在沙漠深处汇合。这条运河全长九百五十公里，宽约一百公尺，建成以后将使二十五万公顷的棉田得到灌溉。这些棉田每年将出产十五万吨优质纤维的棉花。好几万公顷的草原将在沙漠出现，成为著名的土库曼加拉库尔种绵羊的牧场。运河的两岸还要出现许多橘园、柠檬园和桑树林。此外，在第六个五年计划中还要完成萨雷—雅珍水库和第二德詹水库的第一期工程。　章叶（附图片）
