Xinhua News Agency, 30th. The U.S. "Newsweek," published in advance for its October 1st issue, pointed out that Western countries' economic boycott of Egypt is detrimental to themselves.

It said: "Even before U.S. Secretary of State Dulles put forward his user nation plan, no smaller shipping country was willing to endorse the boycott of the Suez Canal."

The weekly said: "The Western Big Three also have concerns. The United States was initially willing to pay $500 million annually to offset the deficit caused to Western Europe by transporting oil around the Suez Canal, and later realized that it still could not reliably guarantee payment of all additional freight. A Western minister admitted that the countries imposing the boycott would suffer more losses than Nasser. Moreover, it does not seem worthwhile to risk further alienation from the Arab world and opening the door to a larger-scale Soviet penetration of the strategically valuable Middle East in order to wage an all-out economic war against Nasser."

The weekly also said that even if all Western countries participated in economic sanctions against Egypt, it is doubtful whether Nasser could be "starved into submission."

### 美国“新闻周刊”指出  西方对埃及经济抵制是作茧自缚

    美国“新闻周刊”指出
    西方对埃及经济抵制是作茧自缚
    据新华社30日讯　提前出版的10月1日一期的美国“新闻周刊”指出，西方国家对埃及实行经济抵制对它们自己不利。
    它说：“甚至在美国国务卿杜勒斯提出他的使用国计划以前，就没有较小的海运国家愿意附和抵制苏伊士运河。”
    这家周刊说：“西方三大国也有所顾虑。美国起先愿意每年付出五亿美元来弥补西欧因绕过苏伊士运河运输石油而造成的赤字，后来又认识到它还是不能确实地保证付给一切额外运费。西方某部长承认，进行抵制的国家所受损失会比纳赛尔所受损失更大。而且，似乎不值得为了对纳赛尔展开全面经济战而冒进一步同阿拉伯世界疏远和为苏联更大规模地渗入具有战略价值的中东大开方便之门的危险。”
    周刊还说，即使所有西方国家都参加对埃及的经济制裁，是否能够使纳赛尔“饿得没有办法只好投降”，还是个疑问。
