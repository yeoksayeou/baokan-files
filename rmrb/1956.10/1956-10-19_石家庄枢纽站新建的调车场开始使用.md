Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 16th. The newly built freight car marshalling yard at Shijiazhuang Hub Station has fully begun operation. Many freight trains from various railway lines are now passing through here smoothly.

　　Shijiazhuang is the intersection of the Jinghan, Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan (original), and Shijiazhuang-Dezhou railways in China. Many freight trains traveling north and south need to be disassembled and assembled here before heading to various locations. In recent years, the volume of freight transport has increased year by year, but the station lacked sufficient marshalling lines, often causing trains to be held at stations near Shijiazhuang for several hours. Now that the new marshalling yard has been completed, the marshalling workload has increased by one-third compared to the original, so the problem of transport congestion has been fundamentally solved.

　　This marshalling yard was designed according to China's new technical standards. The arrangement of tracks is both long and straight, ensuring driving safety. Construction began in November of last year, and after 11 months of intense work, it was completed in early October this year.

    石家庄枢纽站新建的调车场开始使用
    新华社保定16日电　石家庄枢纽车站新建的货车调车场全部开始使用。现在有许多来自各铁路线的货物列车，顺畅地通过这里。
    石家庄是我国京汉、石太（原）、石德（州）三条铁路的交叉点，南来北往的许多货物列车要在这里经过分解编组，然后开往各地。几年来，货运物资量逐年增加，但是这个站编组线路不足，经常发生列车在石家庄临近车站停留几小时的现象。现在新的调车场建成以后，编组作业量比原有的增加三分之一，因而运输堵塞的问题已经从根本上得到解决。
    这个调车场是根据我国新的技术标准进行设计的，编组道股线既长又直，能保证行车安全。它从去年11月份开始兴建，经过11个月的紧张施工，在今年10月初建成。
