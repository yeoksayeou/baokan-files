Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 27th. The closing of the Dafang Reservoir in Fushun began at 2:00 PM today. Crowds gathered on and at the foot of the mountains, on both sides of the closing point, and on the bridge over the water, watching the rapids at the closing point with intense focus. When the chief commander of the closing headquarters issued the closing order, train driver Chen Xian started the locomotive and quickly drove onto the closing bridge amidst cheers. Car after car, large stones were overturned and thrown into the rapids at the closing point. After the first train of forty cars of stones was thrown down, the stones emerged from the water. Ten minutes later, the water level inside and outside the gap differed by more than one meter. The Hunhe River water, blocked from its path, surged at the gap, making sounds as if it wanted to cross the stone pile. At this time, dozens of shock team members carrying stones on both sides of the gap also desperately threw baskets of stones into the gap. Personnel working temporarily at the gap also jumped under the bridge and threw stones into the fierce rapids together with the workers.

At 5:00 PM, the first batch of materials for the closing - 2,880 cubic meters of stone - was completely thrown in, and the water level upstream of the dam rose by nearly one meter, with the river water overflowing in all directions and flowing towards the diversion channel.

Closing the gap is a critical engineering project for building a reservoir. After the closing of the Dafang Reservoir, the Hunhe River, which has been continuously plagued by floods for thousands of years, will be diverted by the people into the controlled diversion channel. The formerly ferocious river water will be used by the people for irrigating fields, generating electricity, and for industrial water.

In the evening, the construction site was brightly lit, and people were still busily pouring sand and clay into the gap. It is expected that the closing project can be fully completed tomorrow.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 28th. The flow of the Hunhe River finally stopped at 6:00 AM this morning, and the river water smoothly flowed downstream through the diversion channel. The entire closing project of the Dafang Reservoir was completed by 12:00 noon today.

Outside the closing gap, the water level of the blocked river has risen by nearly two meters and is quickly forming a new artificial lake; inside the closing gap, the riverbed, which was a rapid current yesterday, has now been exposed. At the mouth of the diversion channel, the water is emerald green; inside the diversion channel, the water flows gently. The Hunhe River, which has often caused floods for many years, will henceforth flow obediently from the diversion channel according to the will of the people.

The flow rate at the closing gap of the Dafang Reservoir reached 24 cubic meters per second. In order to carry out the closing under conditions of very rapid water flow, the Dafang Reservoir Engineering Administration, after several studies, decided to adopt the "horizontal" closing method and mechanized joint operations, which had never been used alone in China's water conservancy construction. This method involves locomotives pulling trains of stones along the circular railway on the construction site to the aerial bridge at the closing gap, where shock team members quickly dump the stones into the rapids at the closing gap. Large amounts of sand and soil transported to both sides of the closing gap are pushed into the water by bulldozers. The adoption of the "horizontal" closing method and mechanized joint operations not only saved thousands of laborers, but more importantly, quickly and safely blocked the river water's path. When people saw the builders of the reservoir orderly cut off the flow of the Hunhe River in sixteen hours, joyful shouts from the builders gathered on the mountains, at the foot of the mountains, inside and outside the closing gap, and on the banks of the Hunhe River could be heard everywhere.

    一条经常泛滥成灾的浑河河流将要为广大人民造福
    大伙房水库合龙工程全部完成
    新华社沈阳27日电　抚顺大伙房水库今天下午二时开始合龙。聚集在山上、山下、合龙口两旁，和水上站桥上的人群紧张的注视着合龙口的急流。当合龙指挥部总指挥发出合龙命令后，机车驾驶员陈显开动机车，在人们的欢呼声中，迅速地驶到了合龙桥上，一车接着一车地把大石块翻投入合龙口的急流中，四十个车皮组成的第一列车石头抛下去，石头就露出了水面。十分钟后，龙口内外水位就相差一公尺多，被阻挡住去路的浑河流水，在龙口汹涌起来，像是要越过石堆似的发出响声。这时，挑石子的数十名突击队员在龙口两岸，同时也把成筐的石头拼命的投入龙口。到龙口临时工作的人员，也纷纷跳到桥底下和工人一道，往凶恶的急流中抛扔石头。
    下午五时，合龙用的第一次材料——两千八百八十立方石头，全部抛完，大坝上游水位升起了将近一公尺，河水向着四面溢去，流向输水道。
    合龙是建设水库的关键性工程。大伙房水库合龙后，千年来不断泛滥成灾的浑河河流，就被人们移到受人控制的输水道中流过。使原来凶恶的河水成为人民灌溉田园、发电和作工业用水。
    入晚，工地上灯火辉煌，人们还在紧张的往龙口倾倒砂子和粘土。预计在明天合龙工程可以全部完成。
    新华社沈阳28日电　浑河流水在今晨六时最后断流，河水顺利地通过输水道涌往下游。大伙房水库合龙工程到今午十二时止全部完成。
    合龙口外，被堵挡住的河水水位已经升高近两公尺，并且很快地形成一个新的人工湖；合龙口内，昨天还是急流的河道，今天已经露出了河床。输水道口，流水碧绿；输水道里，水深潺潺，多少年来经常泛滥成灾的浑河，从此驯服地按照人们的意志，从输水道流过。
    大伙房水库合龙口的流量每秒钟达二十四立方公尺。为了在水流很急的情况下进行合龙，大伙房水库工程管理局经过多次研究后，决定采用我国水利建设中未曾单独采用过的“卧式”合龙方法和机械化联合作业。这种方法就是：合龙时有机车牵引着石块列车，沿着工地上环行铁道，源源开到合龙口空中站桥上，有突击员们迅速把石块倾入合龙口急流中。运到合龙口两旁的大量沙土，由推土机推至水中。采用“卧式”合龙方法和机械化联合作业的结果，不仅节省了成千上万的劳动力，更重要的是迅速而又安全地挡住了河水的去路。当人们看到水库的建筑者有秩序地在十六小时内斩断了浑河的流水，到处都可以听到集结在山上山下、合龙口内外和浑河岸畔建筑者们的欢乐喊声。
