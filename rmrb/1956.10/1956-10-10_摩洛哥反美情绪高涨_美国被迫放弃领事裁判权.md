Xinhua News Agency, 9th - A spokesman for the Moroccan Royal Palace announced on the 8th that the United States has decided to relinquish its consular jurisdiction in Morocco, including consular jurisdiction in certain commercial cases, judicial protection for certain Moroccan citizens belonging to or working in American institutions in Morocco, and jurisdiction over American citizens residing in Morocco.

Parisian press circles pointed out regarding the United States' abandonment of consular jurisdiction in Morocco that, until now, the United States remained the only country unwilling to relinquish those rights it had obtained through unequal treaties with Morocco.

French political commentators believe that this decision by the US government is related to the rising anti-American sentiment in Morocco and the increasingly resolute demands from Moroccan social figures for the complete realization of national sovereignty.

    摩洛哥反美情绪高涨
　　美国被迫放弃领事裁判权
    据新华社9日讯　摩洛哥皇宫发言人8日宣布，美国决定放弃它在摩洛哥的领事裁判权，包括在某些商业案件中的领事裁判权、对于某些属于在摩洛哥的美国机构或者在这些机构中工作的摩洛哥公民的司法保护权以及对居住在摩洛哥的美国公民的裁判权。
    巴黎新闻界就美国放弃它在摩洛哥的领事裁判权一事指出，直到现在，美国仍然是不愿放弃当时由于同摩洛哥签订不平等条约而获得的那些权利的唯一的一个国家。
    法国的政治评论家们认为，美国政府这个决定是同摩洛哥反美情绪的高涨以及摩洛哥社会人士日益坚决要求完全实现国家主权有关。
