    Patient's Gratitude
    Ming Ren
    When I was sick, I often went to the Beijing People's Hospital for treatment. The good attitude of the nurses in this hospital has left an indelible impression on my memory.
    I remember one winter four years ago, I was sent here for emergency treatment due to a severe cold. A senior nurse in the emergency room saw that my condition was serious and immediately came over to help me onto a flat cart, making me comfortable lying on it. She took care of me all the time, pouring me boiled water, wiping my sweat, and finding a doctor. After the treatment, she asked a worker to use the flat cart to send me out the door. She followed me out until she hired a car for me and helped me into the car before she went back in. The image of this tall, kind elderly person with glasses is still deeply imprinted in my mind.
    In recent years, because I have suffered from chronic diseases, I often come to this hospital for treatment. Not long ago, I was admitted to this hospital for the second time.
    Among the nurses in this hospital, there are senior nurses with more than 30 years of service who attend the National Political Consultative Conference, as well as adults with five or ten years of work experience, and young girls who have just graduated from nursing school. They all work diligently for the patients day and night.
    For patients, nursing care is important. What patients need is medical treatment and careful nursing. Nurses are the ones who directly carry out this work according to the doctor's orders. Their consideration for patients in nursing work alleviates the suffering of patients. A noble belief in human life supports them in engaging in this career for life. After I came to this hospital, I received the kind care of the nurses again.
    However, these nurses have troubles in their hearts, because they have always been discriminated against by many people in society in the past, and their work and life have suffered many unreasonable treatments. Now the health department has begun to pay attention to their problems and study how to improve their work. They spoke their minds. One nurse said to me: "We don't have time to study, and we don't even have a place to study and rest. When comrades who live outside get off work at noon to rest, sometimes when it rains, they can't go to the garden, so they have to eat and rest in the toilet." Another nurse told me that because the society lacks a correct understanding of the nursing profession, many people see that nurses do not receive the respect they deserve in society, and believe that there is no future for development, so they are unwilling to study this field. The source of students in nursing schools is getting smaller and smaller, and there is a real feeling that there is no successor.
    It is time for these problems to be solved.
    Respectable nurses! Your labor will surely be respected.

    病人的感谢
    明任
    我生病的时候常到北京市人民医院治疗，这所医院的护士们的良好态度，在我的记忆里留下了不可磨灭的印象。
    记得四年前的一个冬天，我因患重感冒被送到这里来挂急诊。急诊室有一位年长的护士，看到我的病情很重，马上过来把我扶上平车，让我舒服地躺在上面。她时刻照应着我，为我倒开水、擦汗、找大夫。经过治疗以后，她又找工人用平车把我送出门，她跟着一同出来，直到她为我雇好车，并扶我坐上车以后，她才进去。这位高高身材带着眼镜的慈祥长者的形象，至今仍深深地印在我的脑子里。
    这些年来，由于我患了慢性病，就经常到这个医院里来治病。不久以前，我又第二次住进这个医院里。
    在这个医院的护士们当中，有工龄达三十年以上、出席全国政治协商会议的长者，也有工作五年或十年以上的成年人，也有刚从护士学校毕业的年青姑娘。她们都勤勤恳恳地为病人日夜工作着。
    对病人来说，护理工作是重要的。病人所需要的是医药上的治疗和细心的护理。护士正是遵照医嘱直接进行这种工作的人。她们在护理工作上对病人的体贴减轻了病人痛苦。一种对人的生命所怀的崇高的信念在支持着她们终身从事这种事业。我来到这个医院以后，又受到护士们亲切的照顾。
    然而，这些护士们的内心里有苦恼，因为她们过去一直是受社会上许多人歧视的，工作和生活遭受到许多不合理的待遇。现在卫生部门已开始重视她们的问题，研究改进她们的工作。她们说出了心里话。有位护士对我说：“我们没有时间学习，连我们学习和休息的地方也没有。住在外面的同志中午下班休息时，有时天下雨，花园里去不了，只得在厕所里吃饭休息。”还有一位护士告诉我，由于社会上对护士这种职业缺乏正确的了解，许多人看到护士在社会上受不到应有的尊重，认为没有发展前途，都不愿学这一行。护士学校招生来源越来越少，真有后继无人之感。
    这些问题应该到解决的时候了。
    可敬的护士们！你们的劳动一定会受到尊重。
