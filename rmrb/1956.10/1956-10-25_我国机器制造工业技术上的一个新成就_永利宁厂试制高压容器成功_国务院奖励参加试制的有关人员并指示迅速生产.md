A New Achievement in Machine Manufacturing Technology in China
    Yongli Nanjing Factory Successfully Trial-Produces High-Pressure Vessels
    State Council Rewards Relevant Personnel Participating in the Trial Production and Instructs to Expedite Production

    (Our dispatch) The Yongli Nanjing Factory, under the Ministry of Chemical Industry, has successfully trial-produced two high-pressure vessels, one capable of withstanding 132 atmospheres of pressure and the other 320 atmospheres of pressure, since January of this year. The State Council has awarded a bonus of 40,000 yuan to reward the relevant trial production personnel and collaborating units.

    High-pressure vessels are essential equipment for the chemical and petroleum industries and are also relatively difficult to manufacture (high-pressure vessels were the only key equipment in a complete set of nitrogen fertilizer production equipment that could not be manufactured domestically in the past). The usual method for manufacturing this type of high-pressure vessel in the past was to forge large steel ingots on a tens-of-thousands-ton hydraulic press. To date, China does not have the equipment and conditions to manufacture using this method. In the past, all high-pressure vessels were imported from abroad.

    Following the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the need for chemical fertilizers increased greatly. The key to expanding chemical fertilizer production lies in manufacturing high-pressure vessels. For this purpose, Jiang Shengjie, the chief engineer of the Yongli Nanjing Factory, and others proposed trial-producing high-pressure vessels by referring to the multi-layer winding and welding method used by some factories in the United States. This proposal was supported by the relevant leading departments. After careful research and design, they successfully trial-produced a high-pressure vessel capable of withstanding 132 atmospheres of pressure from January to April of this year; from April to July, they successfully trial-produced a high-pressure vessel capable of withstanding 320 atmospheres of pressure. Both high-pressure vessels have undergone pressure resistance tests and burst tests, proving that the quality is good. The high-pressure vessel capable of withstanding 320 atmospheres of pressure reached 1,265 atmospheres in the burst test.

    The multi-layer winding and welding method used by the Yongli Nanjing Factory in this trial production of high-pressure vessels requires simpler equipment than the commonly used forging method and can also save metal, especially high-grade alloy steel, and is safer in use. Therefore, this is a relatively advanced manufacturing method that is more suitable for China's current technical conditions.

    During the trial production of high-pressure vessels by the Yongli Nanjing Factory, the Third Office of the State Council and the former Ministry of Heavy Industry provided great support, which greatly encouraged all personnel participating in the trial production. In the process of trial production, more than a dozen fraternal factories gave them cooperation and support. The East China Aviation Academy and Nanjing Institute of Technology assisted in solving some technical problems. The First Ministry of Machine Building sent five technical cadres to assist in the work, and Daye Steel Plant lent the factory a high-pressure gauge that had just been imported from abroad for trial production. The assistance and support from all parties enabled the trial production of high-pressure vessels to proceed smoothly.

    The successful trial production of high-pressure vessels has laid a reliable foundation for the formal manufacture of high-pressure vessels in the future. This is a major achievement in China's machine manufacturing industry. To this end, the State Council recently instructed the Ministry of Chemical Industry to quickly organize formal production on the basis of successful trial production and to effectively solve various problems in production; at the same time, it requested all relevant departments to provide assistance and support in order to produce more high-pressure equipment to meet the needs of national construction.

    我国机器制造工业技术上的一个新成就
    永利宁厂试制高压容器成功
    国务院奖励参加试制的有关人员并指示迅速生产
    本报讯　化学工业部所属永利宁厂自今年1月以来，先后试制成功了一百三十二个大气压和三百二十个大气压的两个高压容器，国务院已颁发了四万元奖金，奖励有关试制人员和协作单位。
    高压容器是化学工业和石油工业所必需的重要设备之一，也是较难制造的设备之一（生产氮肥的全套设备中，过去国内唯一不能制造的关键设备，就是高压容器）。制造这种高压容器过去常用的方法是用大型钢锭在万吨级水压机上锻造，到目前为止，我国还不具备这种设备条件，不能用这种方法制造。过去所有的高压容器全是由国外进口的。
    在农业合作化高潮到来以后，化学肥料的需要大大增加，扩大化学肥料生产的关键就在于制造高压容器。为了这个目的，永利宁厂总工程师姜圣阶等倡议参考美国某些工厂使用的多层包卷焊接方法试制高压容器，这一倡议获得了有关领导部门的支持。经过精心钻研，设计成功，从今年1月至4月试制成功了一个一百三十二个大气压的高压容器；4月至7月又试制成功了一个三百二十个大气压的高压容器。两个高压容器都经过了耐压试验和爆裂试验，证明质量良好，三百二十个大气压的高压容器在爆破试验中达到一千二百六十五个大气压。
    永利宁厂这次试制高压容器所采用的多层包卷焊接法比通常采用的锻造法所需要的设备简单，并且能够节约金属，特别是高级合金钢，在使用过程中也更安全。因此这是一种比较进步的制造方法，也更适合当前我国的技术条件。
    在永利宁厂这次在试制高压容器的过程中，国务院第三办公室和原重工业部都曾给以很大支持，大大鼓舞了参加试制的全体人员。在试制过程中还有十多个兄弟工厂给了他们以协作和支援。华东航空学院和南京工学院协助解决了若干技术问题。第一机械工业部曾派五个技术干部协助工作，大冶钢厂把刚从国外进口的高压表借给这个厂进行试制工作。各方面的协助和支援使高压容器的试制得以顺利进行。
    高压容器的试制成功，为今后正式制造高压容器打下了可靠的基础。这是我国机器制造工业技术上一个重大成就。为此，国务院最近指示化学工业部在试制成功的基础上，迅速组织正式生产，切实解决生产中的各种问题；同时要求各有关部门予以协助和支持，以便生产出更多的高压设备，以满足国家建设的需要。
