A Tale of Joy and Sorrow
　　　　Ye Qu

    “People fear fame like pigs fear fatness,” is an old saying that doesn't quite apply to the new era. However, some things these days still bring this saying to mind. It's almost a social trend, a result of historical development, and it's become human nature: that is, most people yearn for famous places and famous people. When a place or a person becomes famous, it doesn't always bring happiness, and can even bring many unexpected troubles. The tea farmers of Meijiawu Village are now experiencing this kind of feeling.

    Meijiawu Village is a village in the suburbs of Hangzhou that produces the famous Longjing green tea. In recent years, due to the October Tea Production Cooperative, the village has gained quite a reputation and has become a place for Chinese and foreign guests to visit. Some time ago, news reports stated that Hangzhou was going to build a watch factory. People in Hangzhou were very happy to hear this. Who knew that the site chosen for the watch factory was Meijiawu Village? The tea farmers of Meijiawu Village were both happy and sad, with a lot of worry mixed in with the joy. The factory site requires more than 100 mu of land in total, and the October Tea Production Cooperative's tea land was taking up more than 70 mu, and these were all good, new tea bushes. With the tea land being taken up by more than 70 mu, the October Tea Production Cooperative will reduce its tea production by eight or nine thousand catties each year. This is a large amount, and it's the same for the country. Everyone knows that tea bushes cannot be cultivated well in a year or two; it takes eight or ten years before they can start to be harvested. The tea farmers submitted reports, made suggestions, and pleaded, but it was all in vain. The reason given, it is said, was that the watch factory must be built in a famous place, and Meijiawu Village is a famous place. Also, because surveys and measurements have already been done, it would be a waste of manpower to change it. And because everyone should obey national construction, the tea farmers can’t be the exception? These many reasons, especially the last one, left the tea farmers speechless.

    However, in front of Meijiawu Village, only half a kilometer away, right next to Meijiawu Village, there is a large area of empty land lying barren. That place is called Qifosi (Seven Buddha Temple). It used to be a prosperous village, but it was destroyed by a major fire. For a long time, only broken walls and ruins have remained. It is said that the Textile Workers' Union had planned to build a sanatorium there, but construction has never started. The location of Qifosi is very good, with beautiful scenery, facing the Qiantang River and backing onto Old Man Peak. The tea farmers of Meijiawu Village are wondering: Why isn't the watch factory built in Qifosi? Even if Qifosi is not famous now, it will become famous when the watch factory is built. Why must more than 70 mu of good tea land be destroyed? Why must a factory be built by destroying tea land? Why not build the factory on empty, barren land? Are happiness and misfortune inevitably linked together?

    Some tea farmers lamented, "Tea is not grain; you can't eat it! Might as well have all the tea land taken up to build factories, turning the tea-producing area into a factory area! We can stop picking and making tea, and stop being bossed around! There's no future in living off tea!"

    The matter is so perplexing that I can't help but ask: What is the reason for this? Why not build the factory on barren land, but insist on building it on tea land?

    一则以喜，一则以忧
    野渠
    “人怕出名猪怕胖”，这是一句老话，不十分适用于新时代。不过现在有些事情还要使人想起这句话来。这几乎是社会的风尚，沿革的使然，而且也成了人之常情了：那就是一般人对于有名的地方，有名的人物，都是心向往之的。一个地方或一个人出了名，有时并不带来幸福，甚至还会带来很多意料不到的麻烦，现在梅家坞村的茶农就有了这么一种感触。
    梅家坞村是杭州郊区出产著名的龙井绿茶的一个村子，这个村子近年来因为十月茶叶生产合作社的缘故，颇有声誉，成了中、外来宾们参观的地方。前些时，报上登着消息，杭州要兴建一座钟表厂。杭州人听了都非常高兴。谁知这个钟表厂的厂址挑中了梅家坞村，梅家坞村的茶农又高兴又难过，在喜之中夹了很多的忧。厂址一共需要一百多亩地，十月茶叶生产合作社的茶地被圈去七十多亩，而且都是好的新茶蓬。茶地被圈去了七十多亩，十月茶叶生产合作社每年要减产八、九千斤茶叶。这是一个很大的数目，对国家说来也是如此。大家都知道茶蓬不是一年两年就能培育好的，需要八年十年才能开始采摘。茶农们打报告，提意见，请求，都没有用。据说理由是：因为钟表厂一定要选一个有名的地方建造，而梅家坞村是一个有名的地方。因为已经勘察测量定了，浪费人力，不能更改。因为人人都应当服从国家的建设，茶农难道能例外？这许多理由，特别是最后这一个理由，使得茶农们只有哑口无言了。
    可是，在梅家坞村的前面，只有里把地之远，贴近梅家坞村，就有一大片空地荒着，那地方名叫七佛寺，从前原是一个兴盛的村子，某次被大火所毁，很久以来只留着断垣、残壁。这地方据说纺织工会曾作了建造疗养院的计划，可是一直还没有动工。七佛寺的地点很好，风景美丽，面对钱塘江，背靠老头峰。梅家坞村的茶农们怀疑着：为什么钟表厂不建造在七佛寺呢？即使七佛寺现在还没有出名，造了钟表也就会出名。为什么一定要毁掉七十多亩好茶地？为什么必须破坏茶地才能建设工厂呢？为什么工厂不造到空地荒地上去呢？难道幸福和不幸非连结在一起不可么？
    有些茶农感慨着说：“茶叶又不是粮食，不能当饭吃！干脆把茶地统统圈去造工厂，把产茶区变成工厂区，我们可以不再采制茶叶，不再受气！吃茶叶饭是没出息的！”
    事情费解到这个地步，我也禁不住要问：这究竟为的什么，荒地不造工厂，偏要造到茶地上去？
       1956年10月6日，杭州。
