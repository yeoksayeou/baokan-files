Xinhua News Agency report: Zhuang Xiquan, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, delivered a report on the basic tasks of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese at the First National Congress of Returned Overseas Chinese held on the 6th.

Zhuang Xiquan said that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the people of the whole country have rapidly and effectively carried out a series of socialist reforms. The vast number of overseas Chinese abroad have seen the rapid progress of the motherland, especially the increasing international status and prestige of our country, and therefore love the motherland more, unite more closely around the motherland, and more actively support the socialist construction of the motherland. The returned overseas Chinese and the vast number of relatives of overseas Chinese living in the country have also personally experienced the warm care and consideration of the Party and the People's Government for returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese. In recent years, the patriotic enthusiasm of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in participating in the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland has also been unprecedentedly enhanced. Everyone, together with the people of the whole country, has become an important force in national construction. It has also played a certain role in promoting and expanding the patriotic unity of overseas Chinese abroad and in winning over members of the Chiang Kai-shek clique abroad.

Thanks to the care and support of the Party and the People's Government, in recent years, Returned Overseas Chinese Associations (now renamed Federations) have been established in cities and counties where returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese are relatively concentrated, and those that have not yet been established are also preparing to establish them. At present, there are about seventy or eighty Overseas Chinese Federation organizations across the country, with Guangdong and Fujian provinces being more common. The number of members ranges from two or three hundred to three or four thousand. In various political movements and the central work of various periods in the local area, they have responded to the call of the state, mobilized the vast number of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese to actively participate in various social reforms and socialist construction, and have achieved many achievements. Local Overseas Chinese Federations have played a bridging role in the close contact between local Party and government organs and returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese.

Zhuang Xiquan said that in order to further promote the more active participation of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in the socialist construction of the motherland, to more effectively promote the patriotic unity of overseas Chinese abroad and the close connection between domestic and foreign countries, and to strengthen the leadership of the work of local Overseas Chinese Federations and organize the exchange of experience, it is very timely and very necessary to organize the establishment of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. This not only conforms to the interests and requirements of the vast number of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese, but also conforms to the interests of the socialist construction of the motherland.

Zhuang Xiquan said that at present, the country is in a period of transition, and the Party and the People's Government's policy on domestic overseas Chinese affairs is based on the characteristics of relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese, actively educating and organizing relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese to participate in socialist construction together with the people of the whole country and accept socialist transformation; doing a good job in guiding overseas Chinese investment, so that the vast number of overseas Chinese can more actively participate in the construction of the motherland; properly solving the employment and schooling problems of returned overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese students, and influencing and uniting the vast number of overseas Chinese abroad through relatives of overseas Chinese, returned overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students to love the motherland. All the work of the All-China Federation of Overseas Chinese must be carried out around this policy.

The Overseas Chinese Federation is a mass organization that all classes of returned overseas Chinese can participate in, and it is a mass organization of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese. It should actively unite and educate returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese, mobilize all positive factors among returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese, contribute to the socialist construction of the motherland, and do its utmost to assist the Party and the government in implementing overseas Chinese affairs policies. The basic tasks of the All-China Federation of Overseas Chinese at present are:

(1) Unite and educate the vast number of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese, and actively participate in all aspects of socialist construction in the motherland. Returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese should make full use of their favorable conditions and expertise to participate in the construction of the motherland, especially in the management and reclamation of subtropical economic crops, and in the industry, agriculture, fishery, forestry, and animal husbandry of overseas Chinese hometowns, as well as the cultural, educational, health, and welfare undertakings of overseas Chinese hometowns. Local Overseas Chinese Federations must closely connect with returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese, widely and deeply publicize the government's policy of guiding overseas Chinese investment and the methods of taking care of overseas Chinese investment in establishing cultural, educational, health, welfare, and other public welfare undertakings in their hometowns. It should be explained that since the government promulgated the regulations on overseas Chinese applying to use state-owned barren mountains and wasteland, people's committees at all levels have resolutely implemented them. The Central Overseas Chinese Investment Guidance Committee is preparing to set up overseas Chinese reclamation companies in Guangdong, Fujian, Yunnan, Guangxi, and other places to welcome overseas Chinese investment in the operation of tropical and subtropical crop farms to meet the needs of national construction and give full play to the expertise of overseas Chinese in operating tropical crops. As for overseas Chinese establishing various public welfare undertakings and farmland water conservancy, transportation, housing, and other construction in their hometowns, the Party and the People's Government have also stipulated various preferential care measures. The government welcomes overseas Chinese experts and technical personnel to return to China to participate in construction work and has a proper resettlement policy. In addition to carrying out universal and in-depth publicity, education, and contact to dispel their ideological concerns and actively carry out the work of striving for them, the Overseas Chinese Federation must also earnestly assist them in handling relevant specific businesses and helping to solve various difficult problems, so that overseas Chinese can more enthusiastically participate in various constructions of the motherland.

(2) Widely carry out publicity and education work for returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese to improve the socialist and patriotic ideological awareness of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese. First of all, it is necessary to conscientiously organize and lead all cadres of the Overseas Chinese Federation to study current events, policies, and laws and regulations to help them continuously improve their political, policy, and theoretical level. At the same time, the propaganda work of the Overseas Chinese Federation must be closely combined with the central work of the local area, so that the vast number of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese can understand the various policies of the Party and the People's Government, thereby mastering the policies, enabling the policies to be deeply implemented, and guiding the returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese to actively invest in various movements and enthusiastically participate in various socialist construction and socialist transformation work.

(3) Give play to the role of the Overseas Chinese Federation as a bridge between the Party and the government and returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese, widely and deeply approach returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese, understand their ideological trends, listen to their opinions and requirements, and promptly report the situation and put forward suggestions to the Party and government leading organs and relevant departments. This is the daily work task of the Overseas Chinese Federation. It is necessary to strengthen the mass viewpoint of the cadres of the Overseas Chinese Federation and establish the correct concept of serving overseas Chinese. In the work, it is necessary to study the characteristics of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese. It must be seen that returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese have certain different situations compared with the domestic people. Therefore, when understanding and studying their related problems, it is necessary to take care of the characteristics of these situations so that their reasonable opinions can be valued by the local Party, government, and relevant departments. Only in this way can the Overseas Chinese Federation truly become a link between the Party and the government and the masses. At the same time, the Overseas Chinese Federation itself must conscientiously accept and handle various entrusted matters from returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese and serve returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese abroad. The scope of service work is very wide, including handling entry and exit procedures, writing letters home, mediating disputes, assisting returned overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese students in employment and further education, doing a good job in receiving letters and visits, receiving overseas Chinese who return to their hometowns to visit relatives or sightsee, and all other entrusted matters. In order to further closely connect with the masses, the Overseas Chinese Federation can also organize returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese to participate in tours and various association or recreational activities in a planned way, thereby carrying out many beneficial works.

In order to do a better job in serving returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese, local Overseas Chinese Federations can also consider their own strength and run some welfare undertakings.

(4) Widely carry out contact with overseas Chinese abroad and promote the patriotic unity of overseas Chinese abroad.

When carrying out patriotic propaganda and education for overseas Chinese abroad, it is not enough to just unite progressive overseas Chinese, but should unite all those who can be united and strive to unite all overseas Chinese. We should unite all patriotic overseas Chinese with the spirit of "patriotic family," "harmony is precious," and "seeing each other with sincerity," regardless of when they joined the patriotic ranks, and work together to support the socialist construction of the motherland.

Among overseas Chinese abroad, those who love the country first must not discriminate against those who love the country later. All patriotic overseas Chinese should unite.

In the propaganda on the issue of liberating Taiwan, it should be explained that the Chinese people liberating Taiwan has two possible ways, namely the way of war and the way of peace. The Chinese people are willing to strive to use the way of peace under possible conditions. At present, the US imperialist aggressive forces' interference in China's internal affairs and division of the Chinese national unity have aroused increasingly strong dissatisfaction among the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan, and the possibility of peaceful liberation of Taiwan is growing. The Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party advocate national unity and consistent opposition to foreign countries.

The work for overseas Chinese abroad must be subordinate to foreign policy. In contacting overseas Chinese abroad, it is necessary to make them understand the spirit of the motherland's peaceful foreign policy and must abide by the five principles of peaceful coexistence. As an overseas Chinese, one should respect the laws and social customs of the country of residence, and not participate in the local people's political struggles, so that the government of the country of residence cannot discriminate against overseas Chinese, but respect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese. Every overseas Chinese should be a peaceful envoy of the motherland and promote the establishment, consolidation, and development of peaceful and friendly relations between the people of the country where they reside and the motherland.

(5) Organize and strengthen the leadership of local Overseas Chinese Federations, assist them in rectifying their institutions and improving their organizations, so that they can give full play to their roles.

Zhuang Xiquan finally said that he hopes that local Overseas Chinese Federations will further rectify their institutions, improve their organizations, vigorously carry out their work, and complete the tasks entrusted to us by the great motherland and the vast number of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese abroad under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Overseas Chinese and local Party and government. It is believed that with the correct leadership of the Party and the government, the strong support of more than 20 million overseas Chinese, returned overseas Chinese, and relatives of overseas Chinese, coupled with their own efforts, the future work of the All-China Federation of Overseas Chinese and local Overseas Chinese Federations will surely achieve greater results.

　　全国归国华侨联合会的基本任务
    庄希泉在全国归国华侨第一次代表大会上的报告
    据新华社讯　中华全国归国华侨联合会筹备委员会副主任委员庄希泉在6日举行的中华全国归国华侨第一次代表大会上，作了关于中华全国归国华侨联合会的基本任务的报告。
    庄希泉说，中华人民共和国成立以来，全国人民在中国共产党和中央人民政府的英明领导下，迅速而有效地进行了一系列的社会主义改革。国外广大侨胞看到了祖国的迅速进步，尤其是我国在国际的地位和威望日益提高，因而更加热爱祖国，更加紧密地团结在祖国的周围，更积极地支援祖国的社会主义建设。居住在国内的归侨和广大侨眷，也亲身体会到党和人民政府对归侨、侨眷和华侨的热诚关怀和照顾。几年来，归侨、侨眷参加祖国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的爱国积极性也空前提高了，大家都和全国人民一道，一样成为国家建设的重要力量。在促进和扩大国外华侨的爱国团结的工作，以及争取国外蒋介石集团分子，都已起了一定的作用。
    由于党和人民政府的关怀与支持，几年来，在归侨、侨眷较集中的市、县都先后成立了归国华侨联谊会（现改称联合会），而尚未建立的亦正在准备建立中。目前全国各地已有七、八十个左右的侨联组织，以广东、福建两省较为普遍。其会员人数少者二、三百人，多者三、四千人。它们在各项政治运动和当地各个时期的中心工作中，都响应了国家的号召，动员广大归侨、侨眷积极参加各项社会改革及社会主义建设，取得了不少的成绩。在各地党、政机关密切与归侨、侨眷联系中，各地侨联起了桥梁的作用。
    庄希泉说，为了进一步推动归侨、侨眷更积极地参加祖国社会主义建设，更有力地促进国外华侨的爱国团结和国内、外的紧密联系，加强对各地侨联工作的领导和组织交流经验，组织成立中华全国归国华侨联合会，是很适时而且是很必要的。这不仅符合于广大归侨、侨眷的利益和要求，也符合于祖国社会主义建设的利益。
    庄希泉说，目前国家在过渡时期，党和人民政府对国内侨务工作的方针是根据侨眷、归侨的特点，积极教育，组织侨眷、归侨和全国人民一道参加社会主义建设，接受社会主义改造；做好辅导华侨投资，使广大华侨更积极参加祖国建设事业；妥善解决归国华侨和归国华侨学生的就业就学问题，并通过侨眷、归侨和归国华侨学生去影响和团结国外广大华侨，热爱祖国。全国侨联的各项工作，必须围绕着这一方针来进行。
    侨联是各阶层归侨都可以参加的群众团体，是归侨、侨眷的群众组织，应当积极团结教育归侨、侨眷、调动归侨、侨眷中的一切积极因素，贡献给祖国的社会主义建设事业，竭力协助党和政府贯彻侨务政策。当前全国侨联的基本任务是：
    （一）团结和教育广大归侨、侨眷，积极参加祖国社会主义的各项建设。归侨、侨眷要充分运用自己的有利条件和特长来参加祖国的建设，特别是参加亚热带经济作物的经营垦殖，和侨乡的工、农、渔、林、牧业、以至建设侨乡的文教、卫生、福利事业。各地侨联必须密切和归侨、侨眷和华侨的联系，广泛深入地宣传政府辅导华侨投资的方针政策与照顾华侨投资在家乡兴办文教、卫生、福利等公益事业的办法。说明自政府公布了华侨申请使用国有的荒山荒地条例以后，各地人民委员会均已坚决执行，中央华侨投资辅导委员会已准备在广东、福建、云南、广西等地筹设华侨垦殖公司，欢迎华侨投资经营热带及亚热带作物的农场，以配合国家建设的需要，发挥华侨善于经营热带作物的特长。至于华侨在其家乡兴办各种公益事业及各项农田水利、交通、房屋等建设，党和人民政府也规定了各种优待照顾的办法。对国外华侨的各种专家和技术人员，政府欢迎他们回国参加建设工作，且有妥善安置的政策。侨联除普遍、深入地进行宣传教育和联系，以解除他们的思想顾虑，积极进行争取等工作以外，还要切实协助他们办理有关具体业务及帮助解决各种疑难问题，使华侨更踊跃地参加祖国的各项建设。
    （二）广泛地开展对归侨、侨眷的宣传教育工作，提高归侨、侨眷的社会主义和爱国主义的思想觉悟。首先，要认真组织和领导侨联全体干部学习时事、政策、法令，帮助他们不断提高政治、政策、理论水平，同时，侨联的宣传工作必须紧密地结合当地的中心工作来进行，使广大归侨、侨眷了解党和人民政府各项政策，从而掌握政策，使政策能深入贯彻执行，以引导归侨、侨眷积极投入各项运动，热烈参加各项社会主义建设和社会主义改造工作。
    （三）发挥侨联作为党和政府联系归侨、侨眷的桥梁作用，广泛深入接近归侨、侨眷，了解他们的思想动态，倾听他们的意见和要求，并及时向党、政领导机关及有关部门反映情况和提出建议，这是侨联的日常工作任务。要加强侨联干部的群众观点，树立服务侨胞的正确观念。在工作中要研究归侨、侨眷的特点，必须看到归侨、侨眷与国内人民相比是存在着某些不同的情况，所以当了解研究他们有关问题的时候，要照顾到这些情况的特点，使他们的合理意见能受到当地党、政及有关部门的重视。只有这样，才能使侨联真正成为党、政密切联系群众的纽带。同时，侨联本身，要认真接受和办好归侨、侨眷各种委托代办的事项，要为归侨、侨眷和国外华侨服务。服务工作的范围很广，举凡代办出入国手续，代写家书回文，调解纠纷，协助归侨及归国华侨学生的就业升学，做好来信来访工作，接待华侨回国省亲或观光以及其他一切委托事项，都是属于服务的范围。为了进一步密切联系群众，侨联还可以有计划地组织归侨、侨眷参观旅行和各种联谊或文娱活动，从而进行许多有益的工作。
    为了把归侨、侨眷的服务工作做得更好，各地侨联还可以斟酌自己的力量，办一些福利事业。
    （四）广泛开展和国外华侨的联系，促进国外华侨的爱国大团结。
    对国外华侨进行爱国主义宣传教育的时候，不能满足于仅是团结进步的华侨，而应该团结所有能够团结的人，争取把全体华侨都团结起来。我们对于一切爱国的华侨，都以“爱国一家”“和为贵”“相见以诚”的精神，不论他们参加爱国行列的先后，都应该团结起来，同心协力支持祖国社会主义建设。
    在国外华侨中，先爱国的人千万不要歧视后爱国的人。一切爱国的华侨都应该团结起来。
    在解放台湾问题的宣传上，应说明中国人民解放台湾有两种可能的方式，即战争的方式和和平的方式，中国人民愿意在可能的条件下，争取用和平的方式。目前，美帝国主义侵略势力干涉中国内政和分裂中国民族团结的行为，已经引起了台湾国民党军政人员愈来愈强烈的不满，和平解放台湾的可能性正在增长。中国人民和中国共产党主张全民团结，一致对外。
    对国外华侨的工作必须服从于外交政策，联系国外华侨，要使他们体会祖国和平外交政策的精神，必须遵守和平共处的五项原则。作为一个侨民，应该尊重侨居国的法律和社会风俗习惯，不参予当地人民的政治斗争，使侨居国的政府不能歧视华侨，而尊重华侨的正当权利和利益。每个侨胞都应该做祖国的和平使者，促进所在国的人民和祖国建立、巩固、发展和平友好的关系。
    （五）组织加强对各地侨联的领导，协助他们整顿机构，健全组织，使其充分发挥作用。
    庄希泉最后说，希望各地侨联在全国侨联及当地党政领导下，在原有的工作基础上，进一步整顿机构，健全组织，大力开展工作，完成伟大的祖国及广大的归侨、侨眷、侨胞所付托给我们的任务。相信全国侨联和各地侨联有了党、政的正确领导，有二千多万华侨、归侨、侨眷的大力支持，加上本身的努力，今后的工作一定会获得更大的成绩。
