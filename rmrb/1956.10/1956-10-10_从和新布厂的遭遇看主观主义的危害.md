　　The Harm of Subjectivism Seen from the Encounter of the Hexin Cloth Factory
　　Zhang Jing
    In June of this year, workers from the Hexin Cloth Factory in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, reported to this newspaper a rather absurd incident of dismantling and relocating the factory.

    In July 1955, the Hexin Cloth Factory received a notice from the Wuxi Municipal Textile Industry Bureau: "Due to the danger of the factory building collapsing, production must be stopped immediately." At the time, the factory announced that it could resume work in two or three months. However, a full ten months passed, and the notice of resumption of work seemed to sink without a trace.

    Until May 1956, the Textile Industry Bureau finally issued a notice to the Hexin Cloth Factory, but it was not a notice to resume work, but a notice to merge the Hexin Cloth Factory into the Lixin Textile Factory. Although the workers did not know the inside story, they considered that since it was a merger, they could start work after the machines were installed. More than 400 employees of the Hexin Cloth Factory were truly happy and delighted!

    But strangely, just as some of the Hexin's machines were being installed in the Lixin factory, the Municipal Textile Industry Bureau issued a third notice: "Immediately stop the merger, and the Hexin Cloth Factory will still be returned to its original site for production." The notice from the Textile Industry Bureau was so quick, but more than 400 workers were bewildered and didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

    Now the matter has been investigated and handled by the Provincial Supervision Department. However, carefully examining the ins and outs of this absurd incident is quite thought-provoking.

    People cannot help but raise the following three questions:

    1. Why did the Hexin Cloth Factory stop production?

    2. What is the matter with deciding to relocate the factory and then returning it midway?

    3. Why has such a major event involving more than 400 people not been resolved satisfactorily after a year?

    It turns out that in the spring of 1955, just as the rainy season was about to arrive, Sun Pancheng, Deputy Director of the Wuxi Municipal Textile Industry Bureau, went to the Hexin Cloth Factory for inspection. When he saw the factory building with collapsing walls, crooked beams, and corroded columns, he was greatly alarmed. He thought: "If the factory building collapses, wouldn't the lives of more than 400 employees in the factory be in danger?" After returning to the bureau, Deputy Director Sun considered the issue of having the Hexin Cloth Factory stop work and relocate as soon as possible. In his report to the Municipal Party Committee, he wrote: "The factory building is rotten, the walls are collapsing, and it is crumbling in the slightest wind and rain," "Merging and relocating the factory can save the state 200,000 yuan in infrastructure investment." Although the Municipal Party Committee agreed with this opinion, they did not report to the Provincial Textile Industry Bureau, and on July 1, they formally notified the Hexin Cloth Factory to stop production, and all workers returned home to wait for resumption of work, with 75% of their wages paid monthly.

    It cannot be said that Deputy Director Sun's actions were not well-intentioned, but the problem lies in the fact that Deputy Director Sun only had good intentions and did not conduct in-depth investigations and research or take correct measures that conformed to the objective situation.

    What is the actual situation? The factory buildings of the Hexin Cloth Factory were originally converted from warehouses, and the construction was relatively simple, which is a fact. But if you investigate further, you will know that not all workshop houses are about to collapse. According to the actual situation, as long as more than 30,000 yuan is spent to renovate the preparation room and the finished product room, and the other houses are slightly repaired, it will not be a problem to use them for another five to eight years. It is not necessary to stop production for a long time, let alone dismantle and relocate the factory.

    Having said that, since Deputy Director Sun subjectively decided to relocate the factory, why did he cancel this decision halfway?

    It turns out that the reasons for the Municipal Textile Industry Bureau's decision to relocate the Hexin Cloth Factory to the Lixin Textile Factory are: first, to save state infrastructure investment; second, it is said that Lixin has vacant factory buildings that can be merged; and third, Lixin is a large factory, and its technology and management can drive the Hexin Cloth Factory to improve its level.

    Generally speaking, it is good for small factories to merge into large factories, but it also depends on the specific situation and when the merger is appropriate. The Municipal Textile Industry Bureau did not conduct a thorough investigation of these issues.

    As early as March 1955, the Wuxi Municipal Textile Industry Bureau had decided to relocate the Hexin Cloth Factory to the factory building of the original Lihua Cloth Factory (the original Lihua Cloth Factory had been merged into the Lixin Factory for production), but they did not study with the relevant parties, nor did they understand the situation of the Lihua Cloth Factory's factory building. They made a subjective decision. It was not until they were preparing to relocate the factory that they discovered that the original Lihua Cloth Factory's factory building had been used as a staff and workers' spare-time school, so the Municipal Party Committee did not agree with the Textile Industry Bureau's opinion at that time. In principle, the leading cadres of the Textile Industry Bureau should have learned from the lesson of making blind and hasty decisions on issues this time, and carefully and thoroughly studied the second decision to relocate and merge the factory. However, the Municipal Textile Industry Bureau did not learn from the lesson, and actually repeated the same mistake, making a second absurd decision. It was not until the Hexin Cloth Factory had moved into the Lixin Textile Factory that it was discovered that the surplus factory building of the Lixin Textile Factory was intended for developing printed cloth production and could not allow the Hexin Cloth Factory to merge into it. Therefore, the Textile Industry Bureau had to cancel the decision again and ask the Hexin Cloth Factory to return to its original factory site.

    Why has this matter not been resolved satisfactorily after a whole year? Some leading cadres of the Municipal Textile Industry Bureau believe that: anyway, production has been stopped, at least the safety of more than 400 employees has been guaranteed, and after the shutdown, 75% of the original wages are paid monthly, and their production tasks are also undertaken by other factories. This is the greatest responsibility that has been fulfilled for both the workers and the state.

    The leading comrades of the Wuxi Municipal Textile Industry Bureau originally intended to serve the people diligently, but because subjectivism blocked their ears and eyes, they could not hear the voices of the masses, see the difficulties of the masses in their actual work, and thus care about and solve the difficulties of the masses. Therefore, although they thought they had fulfilled their responsibilities for this matter, their sense of responsibility was divorced from the actual wishes of the majority of the masses, and the result was the greatest irresponsibility.

    The tragedy of subjectivism lies here.

　　从和新布厂的遭遇看主观主义的危害
　　张竞
    今年6月，江苏省无锡市和新布厂的工人向本报揭发了一件相当荒唐的拆厂迁厂事件。
    1955年7月，和新布厂接到了无锡市纺织工业局的通知：“因厂房有倒塌危险，立即停止生产。”当时厂里宣布二、三个月后就可以继续开工。可是整整过去了十个月，复工的通知却像是石沉大海一般，杳无音信。
    直到1956年5月，纺织工业局总算给和新布厂发了通知，不过并非复工，而是通知把和新布厂并到丽新纺织厂去。工人们虽不知就里，但考虑既是并厂，那么机器安装好以后，就可以上工。和新布厂的四百多职工真是个个欢喜，人人高兴！
    可是奇怪，正当和新的一部分机器在丽新厂安装的时候，市纺织工业局又下了第三道通知：“立即停止并厂，和新布厂仍退回原址生产。”纺织工业局的通知下得这样轻快，四百多工人却彷徨徘徊，哭笑不得。
    现在事情已经省监察厅调查处理。不过，细究一下这件荒唐事件的来龙去脉，倒是很能发人深省的。
    人们不能不提出下面三个问题：
    1．为什么要和新布厂停止生产？
    2．决定迁厂，又要中途退回去，究竟是怎么回事？
    3、为什么这样一个关系到四百多人的大事，竟拖了一年还得不到园满解决？
    原来，1955年春，正当霉雨季节将要来临的时候，无锡市纺织工业局孙盘澄副局长，到和新布厂去视察，他一看厂房墙倒梁歪，基柱腐蚀，吃了一大惊，他想：“假使厂房塌下来，全厂四百多职工的生命岂不危险？”孙副局长回到局里，便考虑了要和新布厂赶紧停工迁厂的问题。在给市委的报告中，他写道：“厂房腐烂，墙壁倾颓，稍有风雨，摇摇欲坠”“合并迁厂，可以节约国家基建投资二十万元。”市委虽然同意了这个意见，但他们并未向省纺织工业局报告，便在7月1日正式通知和新布厂停止生产，工人一律回家等待复工，每月发工资75％。
    孙副局长这样做，不能不说是一片好心，可是，问题就在于孙副局长仅仅只有一片好心，没有进行深入的调查研究，采取合乎客观情况的正确措施。
    实际情况是怎样的呢？和新布厂的厂房本由廒间改建，建筑比较简陋，这是事实，但如果再深入调查一下，就知道并非所有车间的房子都要倒塌。根据实际情况，只要花三万多元的费用，将准备间、成品间重新翻造一下，其他房屋稍加修理，再用五年到八年是不成问题的，完全不必要长期停止生产，更不必要拆厂迁厂。
    话又说回来了，既然孙副局长主观主义地决定了迁厂，为什么中途又要取消这个决定呢？
    原来，市纺织工业局决定和新布厂迁入丽新纺织厂的理由是：一、节省国家基建投资；二、据说丽新有空厂房，可以合并；三、丽新是个大厂，技术方面、管理方面都可以带动和新布厂提高水平。
    一般说小厂并入大厂是好的，但是也要看具体情况什么时候并合适？市纺织工业局并没有切实地去调查一下这些问题。
    早在1955年3月间，无锡市纺织工业局就曾决定将和新布厂迁入原丽华布厂的厂房（原丽华布厂已并入丽新厂生产），但他们没有和有关方面研究，也没有去了解丽华布厂厂房的情况，就主观主义地作了决定，直到准备迁厂时，才发现原丽华布厂厂房已经作了职工业余学校，所以当时市委没有同意纺织工业局的意见。照理，纺织工业局的领导干部应该接受这次盲目轻率地决定问题的教训，在第二次决定迁厂并厂时细致周密地研究一下。可是市纺织工业局并没有接受教训，而且居然重蹈复辙，又作出第二次荒唐的决定。一直到和新布厂已经迁入丽新纺织厂后，才发现丽新纺织厂的多余厂房是准备发展印花布生产用的，不能让和新布厂并进去。于是乎纺织工业局不得不再度取消决定，要和新布厂仍退回原厂址去。
    为什么这件事整整拖了一年还得不到园满的解决呢？市纺织工业局的某些领导干部认为：反正停工了，至少是保障了四百多职工的生命安全，而且停工后，每月按原工资的75％照发工资，他们的生产任务也由其他工厂分担了，这无论是对工人对国家都已经尽了最大的责任。
    无锡市纺织工业局的领导同志本意是为了勤勤恳恳地在为人民服务，可是就因为主观主义闭塞了他们的耳目，使他们不能听到群众的呼声，看到群众在实际工作中的困难，从而去关心和解决群众的困难。所以，尽管他们自以为对这件事已经尽了责任，但他们的那份责任感已脱离了大多数群众的实际愿望，其结果却是最大的不负责任。
    主观主义的悲剧也就在这里。
