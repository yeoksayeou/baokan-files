Further Advance the Electric Power Industry
Liu Lanbo, Minister of Electric Power Industry

In the political report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan, it was pointed out that strengthening the construction of the electric power industry plays an important role in realizing China's socialist industrialization. Rationally utilizing power resources and providing cheap and sufficient electricity can not only guarantee the needs of various departments of the national economy but also inevitably promote the rapid development of productive forces. The technological transformation of various departments of the national economy, especially the widespread application of mechanization and automation in modern industrial production processes, must be based on electricity. Therefore, in the process of national industrialization, the electric power industry needs to take a step forward. This point has been proven by the experience of various countries in the world. In particular, we must earnestly learn from the experience of the Soviet Union in persistently implementing Lenin's instructions on electrification for the past forty years.

Twenty-one Regions Across the Country Lack Electricity
Over the past seven years, China's electric power industry has made considerable progress. Thanks to the technical assistance from the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, we have completed the construction of thermal and hydropower stations in Fushun, Fulaerji, Taiyuan, Chongqing, Urumqi, Shanghai, Fengman, Guanting, and Shizitan, as stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan for new and expanded power station projects. The entire basic construction task of the electric power industry can be completed ahead of schedule next year. The originally stipulated power generation of 15.9 billion kilowatt-hours in 1957 may be reached this year. However, such a rate of development still lags far behind the actual needs. Especially in the past two years, with the development of industrial production, the tense situation of power supply has become more apparent. At present, there are twenty-one regions across the country with varying degrees of power shortage. Many power supply areas frequently experience a situation of being "stretched thin."

Growth of Power Generating Equipment is Very Slow
Why is there a situation where the supply of electricity cannot meet the demand? This is mainly because we did not have a sufficient understanding of the growth of production capacity of newly built enterprises and underestimated the industrial production potential of various coastal areas. When determining the First Five-Year Plan, not only were there not enough spare equipment prepared, but there were also varying degrees of power shortage problems in some areas in the original plan. Therefore, when industrial production exceeded the plan, the power supply became even more insufficient. Judging from the implementation of the national five-year plan, the total industrial output value in 1956 is about to approach the level of 1957. The output of major power-consuming enterprises such as steel and cotton yarn will exceed the level of 1957 in 1956. However, the growth of power generating equipment is still growing at the speed stipulated in the original plan. From 1949 to 1955, power generation increased by 185%, while power generating equipment only increased by 60%. Especially after the power generating equipment was fully utilized in 1953, in the past four years, the growth of power generation has averaged 21% per year, while the power generating equipment has only increased by 16.5% per year. Referring to the situation of other countries, during the Fifth Five-Year Plan period in the Soviet Union and from 1951 to 1955 in the United Kingdom and the United States, the growth rate of power generating equipment was greater than the growth rate of power generation. We are exactly the opposite. The growth of power generating equipment lags behind the growth of power generation. This is a fundamental reason for the power shortage over the years. In the case of insufficient power, in order to ensure the production of heavy industry, the use of electricity is often restricted in local industry, the textile industry, and other light industries. Therefore, we are often subjected to due criticism from these regions and departments.

Electricity, like other industrial products, must have a certain reserve. If electricity is insufficient, it will affect the speed of production and basic construction in various departments, just like a shortage of steel. However, the characteristic of electricity production is that production, distribution, and use occur at the same time, and its products cannot be stored. Therefore, the reserve of electricity can only be solved by increasing a certain amount of spare equipment. At the same time, only a certain amount of spare equipment can ensure the increased production of various industrial enterprises and the safe operation of power equipment. However, many of our regions are often in a state of lacking spare equipment. For example, the Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan power systems, although they often restrict electricity use, lacked 16,000 kilowatts of power generating equipment during the maintenance period in the third quarter of this year. Similar situations will occur in the Northeast power system in the next two years. The situation in other regions with only one power station can be imagined.

Appropriately Increase the Scale of Construction of the Electric Power Industry
In the entire electric power industry, how should the growth relationship between power generating equipment and power generation be arranged? Referring to the situation of various countries and based on our country's experience in recent years, we believe that when the backward situation of China's electric power industry cannot be fundamentally changed and many scattered and isolated power stations have not yet been connected to form a power system, the growth rate of power generating equipment should be more than 35% higher than the growth rate of power generation during the Second Five-Year Plan period. If we can maintain such a growth ratio relationship, and appropriately arrange the ratio relationship between power generation and total industrial output value, and rationally deploy the regional distribution of power sources, the electric power industry may be able to meet the needs of normal industrial production, and may also be able to generally cope with the requirements of industrial overproduction. Otherwise, the situation of power shortage will still be difficult to change during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

So, can the current power shortage problem be solved? The answer is yes. Because the existing conditions are different from the past, more than 700,000 kilowatts of power generating equipment supplied domestically and internationally will arrive successively in the next two years; while we are completing the plans of previous years, our technical strength has also developed considerably. Therefore, we believe that in addition to vigorously promoting electricity conservation and rational electricity use throughout the country, as long as the state can appropriately increase the scale of construction of the electric power industry, the current situation of power shortage can be gradually improved.

In order to accelerate the construction of China's electric power industry, the following major measures must also be taken:

Gradually Build Large Power Systems
First, we must gradually build large power systems. A large power system connected by hydropower and thermal power sources scattered in various regions can organize the production and distribution of hundreds of thousands or millions of kilowatts of electricity. This can save construction funds and operating costs; can rationally use power resources; and can improve the reliability of power supply. In recent years, countries around the world have been rapidly developing in this direction. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, in addition to continuing to expand the Northeast and Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan power systems, we will build the Jin, Shan, and Yu power system centered on the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station, the Gan, Qing power system centered on the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station, the Jiang, Zhe power system centered on the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station, the Yunnan power system centered on the Yili River Hydropower Station, the Gan, Yue power system centered on the Shangyou Water and Liuxi River Hydropower Stations, the Xinjiang power system centered on the Urumqi Power Station, and will also build the Sichuan and Lianghu power systems. In the future, after the development of hydropower resources in the main stream of the Yangtze River, it may be possible to form a national joint power system.

Actively Develop Hydropower
Second, we must actively develop hydropower. China's hydropower resources are extremely abundant, distributed throughout the country, and close to industrial resources. In particular, China's major rivers suffer from serious floods. Building large hydropower stations on rivers such as the Yangtze River and the Yellow River can comprehensively solve problems such as flood control, irrigation, and navigation, which has significant economic, political, and national defense significance. Many of China's hydropower resources have superior development conditions: small engineering volume, large benefits, fast construction speed, and cheap cost. These favorable conditions are rare in the world. China's policy of deploying industrial bases centered on steel and large hydropower stations is completely correct. Therefore, we should build as many hydropower stations as possible and as quickly as possible. For the comprehensive utilization of rivers, we will work in division of labor and cooperation with relevant departments under the unified arrangement of the central government to fully exert the strength of all parties.

Construct Regional Large-Scale Thermal Power Stations
We should also actively construct regional large-scale thermal power stations and adopt high-voltage and high-temperature large units. The benefits of this are: fast construction, low cost, and savings in fuel and production personnel. According to existing experience, it generally takes two years to build a power station with two 25,000-kilowatt units; the power station with eight 50,000-kilowatt units that will be built in southern Northeast China is expected to take only three years. Compared with the two, the time is only one year longer, while the equipment is seven times more. The cost per kilowatt of units from 6,000 to 50,000 kilowatts is about 15% to 20% lower at each level, and the number of production personnel is reduced by half at each level. Therefore, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, according to the requirements of the development of China's electric power industry, we hope that the mechanical and electrical manufacturing industries and other industrial departments will manufacture 50,000-kilowatt and above power generating equipment as early as possible to gradually meet the needs of electric power industry construction.

We will provide assistance to the power stations and small power systems built by local governments in coordination with relevant units. We have taken measures to address the growth of electricity consumption in Xinjiang and Tibet, and are prepared to actively cultivate local construction forces. With the construction of large power systems and the development of agricultural production, rural electricity consumption will gradually increase, which also needs to be resolved gradually in a planned manner.

The task of the electric power industry in the Second Five-Year Plan will be very heavy. We believe that under the leadership of the Party, relying on the support of the broad masses of the people and the hard work of all electric power workers, and constantly correcting the shortcomings and errors in our work, we will surely be able to complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party in the process of realizing China's socialist industrialization.

    把电力工业向前推进一步
    电力工业部部长　刘澜波
    在党中央委员会的政治报告和关于第二个五年计划建议的报告中，都指出了加强电力工业的建设对实现我国社会主义工业化的重要作用。合理地利用动力资源，提供廉价充足的电力，既可以保证国民经济各部门的需要，又必然会推动生产力的迅速发展。国民经济各部门的技术改造，特别是现代工业生产过程的机械化、自动化的广泛应用，都必须以电力为基础。因此，在国家工业化的过程中，电力工业需要先行一步。这一点，已为世界各国的经验所证明。特别是苏联四十年来坚持不懈地执行着的列宁关于电气化指示的经验，我们必须认真吸取。
    全国有二十一个地区缺电
    七年来，我国电力工业已有了相当大的发展。第一个五年计划规定新建和扩建的电站项目，由于有了苏联和其他兄弟国家的技术援助，我们已经完成了抚顺、富拉尔基、太原、重庆、乌鲁木齐、上海、丰满、官厅、狮子滩等火力和水力电站的建设。全部电力工业的基本建设任务，明年可以提前完成。原规定的1957年发电量一百五十九亿度，今年就可能达到这个水平。但是这样的发展速度，仍远落后于实际的需要。特别是最近两年来，随着工业生产的发展，电源紧张的局面就暴露得更加明显。目前全国共有二十一个地区存在着程度不同的缺电情况。不少供电地区经常出现“捉襟见肘”现象。
       发电设备增长得很慢
    为什么产生电力供不应求的情况呢？主要是由于我们对新建企业生产能力的增长认识不够，对近海各地的工业生产潜力估计不足，在确定第一个五年计划时，不仅没有准备足够的备用设备，而且原计划中就存在着若干地区不同程度的缺电的问题。因此，当工业生产超计划上涨时，电力供应就更加不足。从全国五年计划执行情况来看，工业总产值1956年即将接近1957年的水平。如钢铁、棉纱等主要用电企业的产量，都将在1956年超过1957年的水平。可是发电设备仍按原计划规定的速度增长。从1949年到1955年发电量增加了185％，而发电设备只增加60％。特别是在1953年发电设备已达到充分利用后，四年来，发电量的增长每年平均为21％，而发电设备每年仍只增加16.5％。参考其他国家的情况，苏联在第五个五年计划期间和英、美从1951年到1955年，发电设备的增长速度都大于发电量的增长速度。我们恰恰与此相反，发电设备的增长落后于发电量的增长，这就是历年来电源紧张的一个根本原因。在电力不足的情况下，为了保证重工业的生产，用电受到限制的往往是地方工业、纺织工业及其他轻工业，因而我们也就常常受到来自这些地方和部门的应有的责难。
    电力同其他工业产品一样，都要有一定的储备。如果电力不足，就会同缺少钢材一样地影响到各部门的生产和基本建设的速度。但是，电力生产的特点是生产、分配和使用在同一个时间，它的产品不能储存。因此，电力的储备只能用增加一定数量的备用设备来解决。同时，只有一定的备用设备，才能保证各工业企业的增产和电力设备的安全运行。而我们却有很多地区经常处于缺少备用设备的状态。例如北京、天津、唐山电力系统，虽然经常限制用电，今年第三季度检修期间，还缺少发电设备一万六千瓩。东北电力系统明后年也将出现类似情况。其它仅仅有一个电站的地区的情况也就可以想见了。
    适当加大电力工业的建设规模
    在整个电力工业中，应当怎样来安排发电设备和发电量的增长关系呢？参考各国情况，并根据我国几年来的经验，我们认为，当我国电力工业技术落后的局面还不能根本改变，许多分散孤立的电站还没有联成电力系统的时候，在第二个五年计划内发电设备的增长速度，应该高于发电量增长速度的百分之三十五以上。能够保持这样的增长比例关系，并且适当地安排发电量与工业总产值之间的比例关系，合理地部署电源的地区分布，电力工业就可能满足工业正常生产的需要，也可能大体应付工业超额增产的要求。否则，在第二个五年计划时期，缺电的情况还是难于改变的。
    那末，目前缺电的问题能不能解决呢？答复是肯定的。因为现有条件比较已往有所不同，今明两年国内外供应的发电设备将陆续到达七十万瓩以上；我们在完成历年计划的同时，技术力量也有了相当的发展。因此，我们认为除了在全国大力提倡节约用电和合理用电之外，只要国家能够适当地加大电力工业的建设规模，目前电源紧张的状况是能够逐步得到改善的。
    为了加速建设我国电力工业，还必须采取以下几项主要办法：
     逐步建设大的电力系统
    首先，要逐步建设大的电力系统。由分散在各地的水力、火力电源联接起来的大电力系统，可以组织几十万、几百万瓩以上的电力的生产和分配。这样就可以节省建设资金和运行费用；可以合理使用动力资源；可以提高供电的可靠性。近年来，世界各国都迅速朝着这个方向发展。在第二个五年计划时期，我们除继续扩大东北和京、津、唐电力系统外，将建设以三门峡水电站为中心的晋、陕、豫电力系统，以刘家峡水电站为中心的甘、青电力系统，以新安江水电站为中心的江、浙电力系统，以以礼河水电站为中心的云南电力系统，以上犹水、流溪河两水电站为中心的赣、粤电力系统，以乌鲁木齐电站为中心的新疆电力系统，还将建设四川和两湖的电力系统。将来长江干流水力资源开发后，就可能形成一个全国性的联合电力系统。
       积极发展水力发电
    其次，要积极发展水力发电。我国水力资源极其丰富，分布全国各地，靠近工业资源。尤其我国各大河流水患严重，在长江、黄河等河流上建设大水电站，可以综合解决防洪、灌溉、航运等问题，在经济上、政治上和国防上都有着重大的意义。我国许多水力资源具有优越的开发条件：工程量小，效益大，建设速度快，造价便宜，这些有利的条件为世界各国所少见。我国以钢铁和大水电站为中心布置工业基地的方针是完全正确的。因此，我们应当尽多、尽快地修建水电站。对于河流的综合利用事业，我们将在中央统一安排下，同各有关部门分工合作，以充分发挥各方面的力量。
     建设区域性大型火电站
    还应当积极建设区域性大型火电站，采用高压高温的大机组。这样的好处是：建设快，造价低，节省燃料和生产人员。根据已有的经验，建设两台两万五千瓩机组的电站，一般用两年时间；即将在东北南部建设的八台五万瓩机组的电站，预计只要三年时间。两者相比，时间只多一年，而设备多了七倍。六千到五万瓩的机组，每瓩造价逐级约低15％到20％，生产人员逐级减少一半。因此，在第二个五年计划期间，根据我国电力工业发展的要求，我们希望机械、电机制造等工业部门提早制造五万和五万瓩以上的发电设备，以逐步满足电力工业建设的需要。
    对地方建设的电站和小型电力系统，我们将配合有关单位予以帮助。新疆、西藏地区的用电增长问题，我们已在分别采取措施，并准备积极培养地方建设力量。随着大电力系统的建设和农业生产的发展，农村用电将会逐渐增长起来，在这方面也需要有计划地逐步加以解决。
    第二个五年计划的电力工业的任务将是很大的，相信在党的领导下，依靠广大人民群众的支持和全体电业职工的艰苦努力，不断改正我们工作中的缺点和错误，在实现我国社会主义工业化的过程中，我们一定能够完成党所交给我们的任务。
