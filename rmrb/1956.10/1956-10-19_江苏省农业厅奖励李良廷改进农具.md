    The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture Rewards Li Liangting for Improving Farm Tools
    (Our newspaper reports) Before this year's autumn planting, the Xuzhou Special District of Jiangsu Province continued to promote more than 30,000 improved seed drills. This farm tool was manufactured by Li Liangting, a farmer from Dali Village Township, Fengxian County. According to experiments, using it to sow wheat, under the same conditions, can yield 33 jin more per mu than the old-fashioned three-legged seed drill. The advantage of this farm tool (nine-legged seed drill) is that the row spacing is small, it can automatically sow seeds, and the seeds are sown evenly at the same depth.
    The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture has issued a bonus of 500 yuan to Li Liangting to encourage his spirit of creativity.

    江苏省农业厅奖励李良廷改进农具
    本报讯　江苏省徐州专区在今年秋种以前，继续推广改良耩子三万多架。这种农具是丰县大李庄乡农民李良廷制造的。据试验，使用它播种小麦，在同样条件下，比老式三条腿耩子每亩可多收三十三斤。这种农具（九腿耩子）的优点是行距小，能自动下种，种子播的匀，深浅一样。
    江苏省农业厅已发给李良廷奖金五百元，鼓励他的创造精神。
