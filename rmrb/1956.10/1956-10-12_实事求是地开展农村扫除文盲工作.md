    Conducting Rural Literacy Campaigns Realistically
    By Our Newspaper Commentator
    Currently, there are two different opinions regarding the rural literacy campaign. One opinion is that the literacy campaign has been too hasty, even misguided. This view is mainly held by comrades leading production. They believe that since the spring plowing, the literacy campaign has hindered production and should not be continued. The other opinion is that the literacy campaign has not been too hasty. This view is mainly held by comrades actually working on the literacy campaign. They say that production has taken precedence over everything else, and the literacy campaign has been squeezed out.
    So, what is the actual situation of the literacy campaign? It should be said that after opposing conservative and passive thinking, the rural literacy campaign has taken on a new look since last winter, and the achievements are significant. However, leaders at all levels have overlooked the complexity of the literacy campaign and have been too hasty in their work. For example, the literacy campaign plans were generally too high and too urgent; there was a simple pursuit of numbers, regardless of the conditions of the illiterate and the actual situation at the time and place, and there were general requirements, with at least a few places even experiencing some coercive phenomena. After the start of spring plowing, due to the tension of production, many places relaxed their leadership of the literacy campaign; although a few local leaders grasped it tightly, they did not adapt to the busy farming season, and there was a large-scale shutdown of people's schools and a sharp decline in the number of students.
    Why are there different, even contradictory, views on the rural literacy campaign? The main reason is that some comrades lack a correct understanding of the relationship between the literacy campaign and production. Some comrades leading production often only see production as the central task, overemphasizing the importance of production, and not truly understanding that the literacy campaign will powerfully promote the development of production and technological progress. Therefore, in actual work, they did not properly take care of and arrange the literacy campaign. Some comrades engaged in the literacy campaign often only see the aspect of the broad masses actively demanding to learn, and ignore the actual situation of tight rural production, so the demands are somewhat unrealistic. Both the former and the latter have their correct side, but each also has its one-sidedness. These two views should be combined so that comrades guiding production can arrange the literacy campaign in a unified way with production as the center; and comrades engaged in the literacy campaign can also start from the overall situation and carry out their work in accordance with the production situation.
    Carrying out the rural literacy campaign should be realistic, based on needs and also on actual possibilities, and act according to conditions. Agricultural cooperatives with relatively normal production and good management can carry out the literacy campaign well; conversely, agricultural cooperatives with chaotic production and management and unstable members' production enthusiasm should do less or even postpone the literacy campaign. For those who are willing to learn and able to learn, they should be actively organized to learn; for those who are unwilling to learn or who are willing to learn but have practical difficulties and cannot learn, it is not appropriate to force them. When the farming season is not too busy, the campaign should be actively carried out; during the busy season, it should be suspended; in addition, the strength of mass teachers and the original foundation should also be considered. The good or bad production and management of agricultural cooperatives is the main condition determining whether the literacy campaign can be carried out and the size of the scale. This winter and next spring, rural production and various tasks are still very busy, especially in some areas with heavier disasters, and it will still take some time for the management of cooperatives to get on track. Therefore, the literacy campaign should not be required to be too high.
    According to the current situation, all localities can start from checking and summarizing their work, consolidating existing achievements, overcoming shortcomings, and determining the literacy campaign plan for this winter and next spring, and making preparations as soon as possible. Literacy campaign plans that are too high and too urgent should also be revised. In actual work, it is necessary to implement the principle of "in stages and in groups, according to people and events," and achieve "learn more when not busy, learn less when slightly busy, and stop learning when very busy," adapt to the production situation, use various forms (where conditions permit, centralized learning should be organized in classes and groups), and organize those who can persist in learning to learn regularly. Young people have the most urgent need to learn, and where conditions permit, consideration can be given to using separate classes and groups to accelerate their learning progress. In the past, localities relaxed their teaching guidance work. This winter, they should do a good job in the training and tutoring of mass teachers to improve the quality of teaching. This year, the phenomenon of mobility of mass teachers is quite common and serious, so it is necessary to expand the source of teachers, uniformly arrange rural literacy forces, and pay attention to timely replenishment. The problem of work delays for mass teachers also needs to be properly resolved, and can be solved by using cooperative work points, subsidies, or voluntary sharing and exchange of work by members, depending on different situations and conditions. The leadership and support of townships and societies are important keys to the smooth development of the literacy campaign. Townships and societies should designate special personnel to be responsible for managing the literacy campaign, uniformly arrange production, meetings, and study time, and assist in solving specific problems.

    实事求是地开展农村扫除文盲工作
    本报评论员
    目前在农村扫除文盲工作方面，有两种不同的意见。一种意见认为扫除文盲冒进了，甚至说搞错了。持这种意见的以领导生产的同志为多。他们认为从春耕以来，扫除文盲妨碍了生产，不能搞了。另一种意见认为扫除文盲没有冒进。持这种意见的以实际做扫除文盲工作的同志为多。他们说，生产压倒了一切，扫除文盲工作被挤掉了。
    那末，扫除文盲工作的实际情况究竟怎样呢？应该说，经过反对消极保守思想，自去冬以来，农村扫除文盲工作气象一新，成绩是很大的。但是，各级领导忽视了扫除文盲工作的复杂性，把事情做得急了一点，如扫除文盲规划的一般偏高、偏急；单纯追求数字，不分文盲的条件，不问当时当地的实际情况，一般要求，以至少数地方还曾发生了一些强迫命令现象。春耕开始以后，由于生产紧张，不少地方放松了对扫除文盲工作的领导；少数地方领导虽然抓得紧，却没有适应农事繁忙的情况，出现了民校大量停办和学员人数急剧下降的现象。
    为什么在农村扫除文盲工作上，会产生不同的，甚至互相对立的看法呢？主要原因就在于有些同志对于扫除文盲和生产的相互关系缺乏正确的理解。有些领导生产的同志往往只看到生产是中心工作，过分强调生产的重要，没有真正懂得扫除文盲将有力地推动生产的发展和技术的进步，因而在实际工作中没有适当照顾和安排扫除文盲工作。有些从事扫除文盲工作的同志往往只看到广大群众积极要求学习的方面，忽视农村生产紧张的实际情况，因而要求有点不切实际。无论是前者还是后者都有其正确的一面，但也各有片面性。这两种看法应当结合起来，指导生产的同志能够以生产为中心，来统一安排扫除文盲工作；而从事扫除文盲工作的同志也能够从全面情况出发，适应生产情况来开展自己的工作。
    开展农村扫除文盲工作，应该实事求是，既根据需要，也要从实际可能出发，按条件办事。农业合作社生产比较正常，管理工作做得好的，就能够很好地开展扫除文盲工作；反之，农业合作社生产、管理都很混乱，社员生产情绪还不稳定的，就应少做甚至缓做扫除文盲工作。对于愿意学习而又能够学习的人，要积极组织他们学习；对于不愿学习或虽愿学习但有实际困难，不能学习的人，就不宜勉强。在农事不大忙的时候，应当积极开展；在大忙时候，则应暂停；此外还要考虑到群众教师力量，原有基础。农业合作社的生产和管理得好坏，是决定扫除文盲工作能否开展以及规模大小的主要条件。今冬明春农村生产和各项工作还很繁忙，特别是某些地区又有较重的灾情，要使合作社的管理上轨道也还需要一定时间。因此扫除文盲工作，还不宜要求很高。
    根据目前情况，各地可以从检查和总结工作着手，巩固现有成绩，克服缺点，并确定今冬明春的扫除文盲的计划，及早作好准备工作。扫除文盲计划偏高、偏急的，也要重新修订。在实际工作中，一定要执行“分期分批，因人因事”的原则，做到“不忙多学，小忙少学，大忙放学”，适应生产情况，运用多种形式（有条件集中学习的，应尽量组织班、组教学），组织能够坚持学习的人经常学习。青年人学习要求最迫切，有条件的地方可以考虑采用单独编班编组等方式，加快他们的学习进度。各地过去放松了教学指导工作，今冬要做好群众教师的训练、辅导工作，以提高教学质量；今年群众教师流动现象相当普遍而严重，因此要扩大师资来源，统一安排农村识字力量，注意及时补充。群众教师误工问题，也需要妥善解决，可根据不同情况和条件，用合作社记工、补助，或社员自愿分摊、换工等办法来解决。乡、社的领导和支持，是顺利开展扫盲工作的重要关键。乡、社都要指定专人负责管理扫除文盲工作，统一安排生产、会议和学习的时间，协助解决具体问题。
