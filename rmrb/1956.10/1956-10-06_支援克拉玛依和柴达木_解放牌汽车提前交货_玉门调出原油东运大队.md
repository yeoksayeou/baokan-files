Xinhua News Agency, Changchun. The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant recently dispatched 31 Liberation brand trucks to the Karamay and Qaidam Basin oil exploration areas in batches to support transportation there.

These trucks are part of this year's orders; originally, the contract stipulated delivery in November and December, but key construction units wrote one after another, enthusiastically requesting early delivery.

Although these trucks were trial-assembled, they were found to be fully qualified after inspection by various departments.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Yumen Oil Mine's crude oil eastbound transportation team, including more than 200 heavy-duty trucks, was transferred to the Karamay and Qaidam Basins in batches during September.

Since the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway was laid to the Yumen Oil Mine this year, Yumen Oil Mine's crude oil has begun to be transported eastward by train. Therefore, the original motorcade responsible for crude oil eastward transportation can be transferred to the Karamay and Qaidam Basin oil exploration areas to support the increasingly busy transportation work there.

Many of the hundreds of drivers, assistants, and cadres transferred to Karamay and the Qaidam Basin this time are model workers and advanced producers. Before their departure, they challenged each other, guaranteeing that they would continue to carry forward the spirit of overcoming difficulties on the crude oil eastward transportation line and continue to carry out the "safety, economy, 100,000 kilometers without major repairs" competition in their new positions to complete the glorious tasks assigned to them by the Party and the country.

    支援克拉玛依和柴达木
    解放牌汽车提前交货　玉门调出原油东运大队
    新华社长春电　第一汽车制造厂最近先后把三十一辆解放牌汽车运往克拉玛依和柴达木盆地石油探区，支援那里的交通运输。
    这些汽车，是今年订货中的一部分；本来合同规定11、12月份交货，可是重点工程建设单位纷纷来信，热情地请求提前交货。
    这些汽车虽然是试装的，可是经各部门检查，质量完全合格。
    据新华社讯　玉门油矿的原油东运大队，包括二百多辆载重卡车，在9月份分批调往克拉玛依和柴达木盆地。
    今年兰新铁路铺轨到玉门油矿以后，玉门油矿的原油，已经开始用火车东运，因此原来担任原油东运的汽车大队，可以调到克拉玛依和柴达木盆地石油探区，支援那里日益繁忙的运输工作。
    这次调往克拉玛依和柴达木盆地的数百名司机、助手和干部，有许多都是劳动模范和先进生产者。他们在出发以前，相互进行挑战，保证要在新的工作岗位上，继续发扬在原油东运线上克服困难的精神，继续开展“安全、节约、十万公里无大修”的竞赛，完成党和国家交给他们的光荣任务。
