Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 9th. Building units in Taiyuan, Datong, Changzhi, Yuci and other cities in Shanxi Province, where there are many winter construction projects this year, are already preparing for winter construction. The Datong Municipal Construction Engineering Company, the Datong Coal Mine Capital Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry, and other units have basically prepared all the building materials needed for winter construction. In response to the large number of engineering tasks this winter and the insufficient supply of machinery and building materials, the North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau is tapping the potential within the enterprise in many ways. For example, according to the plan, there is a shortage of more than 7,000 tons of steel this winter. After taking stock of the warehouse, it was discovered that there are more than 6,000 tons of substandard steel that can be exchanged with other units, so the steel shortage is only more than 400 tons.

Various new technologies to be used in winter construction are also being tested in various units. The North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau started testing new technologies such as "cement mixed with gypsum" and "cold concrete" as early as August. Once these new technologies are successfully tested, they will be widely promoted in winter construction. Many units are also carrying out technical and equipment preparations for using steam and electric heating methods and various warming methods in winter construction.

The winter construction task in Shanxi Province this year accounts for about 6.5% of the total annual capital construction task, striving to reach 7%. This is about twice the winter construction task in the same period last year. At the same time, the technical requirements for winter construction projects this year are also more complex than last year. For example, of the 64 winter construction projects determined by the North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau, more than 90% belong to industrial construction.

    挖掘潜力克服设备、材料不足的困难
    山西基本建设单位准备冬季施工
    新华社太原9日电　山西地区今年冬季施工项目较多的太原、大同、长治、榆次等市的建筑单位，已经在准备冬季施工。大同市建筑工程公司、煤炭工业部大同煤矿基本建设局等单位，冬季施工所需要的全部建筑材料已经基本上准备妥当。华北太原工程局针对今冬工程任务大，机械设备和建筑材料供应不足的情况，正在多方面挖掘企业内部的潜力。如按计划今冬缺少钢材达七千多吨，经过清点仓库，发现有六千多吨不合规格的钢材可以和其他单位调换，这样钢材缺额就只有四百多吨了。
    冬季施工中将要采用的各种新技术也正在各单位开始试验。华北太原工程局早在8月份就开始了“水泥掺石膏”、“冷混凝土”等新技术的试验工作。这些新的技术试验成功就要在冬季施工中普遍推广。还有许多单位为在冬季施工中采用蒸气和电热法以及各种保暖方法进行着技术和设备方面的准备工作。
    山西地区今年冬季施工任务约占全年基本建设总任务的6.5％，争取达到7％。这比去年同期的冬季施工任务增大了一倍左右。同时，今年冬季施工工程的技术要求也比去年复杂，例如华北太原工程局确定的六十四项冬季施工项目中，属于工业建设的就占90％以上。
