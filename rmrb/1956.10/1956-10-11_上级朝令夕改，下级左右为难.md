    Superiors Change Orders Frequently, Leaving Subordinates in a Dilemma
    In just one month, the immigration task of Lushan County, Henan Province, has been changed five times by the superiors. Leading comrades of the Xuchang Prefectural Commissioner's Office Immigration Committee of Henan Province, please put yourselves in the shoes of the lower-level cadres and think about it. It is very easy for you to make a phone call to change the numbers, times, and locations, but how much difficulty will this cause the lower-level cadres! Even if these changes are indeed unavoidable, you should send people down to understand the specific difficulties and earnestly help them overcome them. Editor:
    On July 15th, Li, the section chief of our Lushan County Civil Affairs Section, brought back an immigration task of 10,000 people from the provincial and prefectural immigration work conferences. The conference required us to complete all preparations before the end of July, with the immigrants gathering in the county on August 2nd and departing by car on the 4th. Due to the large task and the urgent timeframe, we immediately studied it with the county party committee that day, assigned numbers to some districts and townships, transferred cadres, established organizations, and determined the work methods and steps for the entire movement. On July 18th, we also held a county-wide immigrant representative conference with more than 800 people. The immigration work officially began.
    Immigrant land reclamation is a good thing that benefits the country and the people. Therefore, the cadres were very enthusiastic, and the broad masses of people actively supported it, so the work progressed smoothly, and many districts and townships voluntarily applied for registration. Preparations for luggage, dry food, and other work were also underway. However, at this time, the immigration work began to change constantly.
    On July 27th, the Prefectural Commissioner's Office Immigration Committee instructed by telephone that the departure time for immigrants should be postponed to the beginning of September, supposedly because the Qinghai vehicles were concentrating their efforts to support the industrial construction of the Qaidam Basin, and transportation from Lanzhou to Xining was difficult. At that time, we reflected that delaying the time might cause problems, but the superiors still did not allow it to be advanced. In order not to let the immigration work affect the country's industrial construction, we implemented the instructions of the superiors and redeployed the county's immigration work. However, on August 12th, we suddenly received a telephone instruction from the Prefectural Commissioner's Office Immigration Committee, roughly stating that some counties in Qinghai Province had suffered hailstorms, and in order to take care of the lives of the immigrants and to allow the immigrants from our county to leave earlier, it was decided that the 2,500 immigrants from our county who were originally going to Ledu County, Qinghai Province, would be changed to Dunhuang County, Gansu Province, and would depart on August 20th. At that time, we considered that changing the location of the immigrants would cause many problems and requested that it not be changed. The Prefectural Commissioner's Office replied that "going to Dunhuang has been decided, and it will be distributed as a task, and cannot be changed." Since it was the decision of the superiors, we had no choice but to implement it. So we worked day and night to rearrange the work. On August 14th, the Prefectural Commissioner's Office Immigration Committee called again, instructing that in addition to the immigrants going to Dunhuang, Gansu Province, leaving around August 20th, the immigrants going to Qinghai Province should also depart around August 25th. In this way, our work became even more tense. On August 15th, we held an emergency meeting of immigration cadres and deployed various emergency tasks. On August 19th, we suddenly received a telephone instruction from the Prefectural Commissioner's Office Immigration Committee, saying that the time to go to Dunhuang County, Gansu Province, was postponed again to September 1st to 3rd, because the vehicles from Jiuquan to Dunhuang were difficult to dispatch, and there were also difficulties with the trains. At that time, we repeatedly requested to leave earlier, but it was not approved, so we had to rearrange the work again. On August 22nd, when two batches of 2,500 immigrants going to Minhe County were gathering in the county, we suddenly received a telephone call from the Prefectural Commissioner's Office Immigration Committee saying that of the 2,500 immigrants going to Minhe, 1,250 would leave on August 25th, and the rest would be postponed to September 9th; the immigrants leaving on August 26th would be moved from Minhe to Huangyuan because "there are problems with the trains"; the immigrants going to Dunhuang, Gansu Province, would be postponed from September 1st to 3rd to September 6th to 8th; and the immigrants going to Huangyuan would be generally postponed. At that time, we suggested that the time for the immigrants going to Dunhuang should still be according to the original plan; part of the two batches of immigrants going to Minhe County had already gathered in the county, and there was no way to call the masses back, and the problems of food and accommodation could not be solved in the county. At the same time, it was also difficult for the immigrants going to Huangyuan to leave on August 26th, as their luggage had not been prepared. However, the superiors rejected our opinions again.
    Due to the multiple changes in the time and location of the immigration, the problems that arose and the losses to the country and the masses were great. First of all, due to repeated changes, the immigrants' thinking had undergone great changes. The immigrants in Zhangliang Township have been asking to leave earlier, otherwise they will not go. The lives of many immigrants have also become difficult. Due to the great changes in the immigrants' thinking, the approval could not be finalized many times, which affected the completion of various preparatory work before departure as scheduled. Secondly, this has caused great losses to the county's autumn production and various tasks this autumn. This summer, some areas of Lushan County (mainly immigrant areas and townships) suffered severe floods. Cadres and the masses should have concentrated their efforts on doing a good job in autumn production. However, from mid-July to the end of August, hundreds of cadres from the county, districts, townships, and agricultural cooperatives focused their main efforts on immigration work. Not only could the immigrants not participate in production, but it also affected the production enthusiasm of other masses. Without calculating how many working days were lost and how much income was reduced due to the postponement of the immigrants' departure, the extra relief funds issued by the government alone amounted to 15,000 yuan. At the same time, the dry food prepared by the immigrants had become moldy and rotten due to the rainy weather and the long time, amounting to 18,000 kilograms. In addition, the excess expenditure on office expenses was also more than 5,000 yuan. Thirdly, due to the constant changes in time, luggage was concentrated in the county, and immigrants lacked clothes and blankets. In addition, due to the rainy and cold weather, many immigrants became ill. In general, the endless changes in this immigration work have greatly damaged the prestige of the Party and the country among the masses. The changes in time and location are beyond the power of our county to decide. It is said that the Prefectural Commissioner's Office also has no power to decide. We are not sure who should be responsible. However, we have repeatedly reported the series of problems caused by the changes in time and location to the Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the province. Strangely, the provincial and prefectural immigration departments not only did not inspect the actual situation in the county and help solve some specific problems, but instead used "tasks" and "decisions" to replace solving practical problems everywhere, ignoring the suffering of the masses, and adding a lot of difficulties to the work below.
    We believe that the province and the prefecture should learn from this lesson and carefully examine their own responsibilities.

    上级朝令夕改，下级左右为难
    仅一个月的时间，河南省鲁山县的移民任务就被上级改变了五次。河南省许昌专署移民委员会的领导同志，请你们设身处地地为下级干部想一想，你们打一个电话改变一下数字、时间和地点是很容易的，可是这要给下级干部造成多大困难啊！即使这些改变确实不能避免，也应该派人到下面去了解具体的困难，并且切实帮助下面克服困难。编辑同志：
    7月15日，我们鲁山县民政科的李科长，从省、专移民工作会议上，带回了一万名的移民任务。会议要求我们在7月底以前做好一切准备工作，移民在8月2日集中到县，4日就要乘车启程。由于任务大，时间急，我们当天即与县委作了研究，向一些区、乡分配了数字，抽调干部，建立组织，确定了整个运动的工作方法和步骤。7月18日还召开了八百多人的全县移民代表会议。移民工作就正式开始了。
    移民开荒，是一件益国利民的好事情。因此干部劲头很大，广大群众也都积极拥护，所以工作进行的很顺利，各区、乡自愿申请报名得很多。准备行李、准备干粮等工作，也都在紧张地进行着。然而就在这个时候，移民工作却接连不断发生了变化。
    7月27日专署移民委员会电话指示，移民启程时间推迟到9月初，据说是因为青海的汽车当时正集中力量支援柴达木盆地的工业建设，由兰州至西宁段运输困难。当时我们曾反映：延迟时间可能会发生问题，但是上级仍不允许提前。我们为了不使移民工作影响国家的工业建设，就执行了上级的指示，重新部署了全县的移民工作。但是，8月12日突然又接到专署移民委员会的电话指示，大意是青海省有些县遭受雹灾，为了照顾移民的生活并且为了让我们县的移民提前走，决定我县原去青海省乐都县的二千五百名移民，改至甘肃省敦煌县，8月20日就要启程。当时我们考虑到更动移民地点问题很多，要求最好不要变动。专署的答复是“去敦煌已经决定，作为任务向下分配，不能更改”。既是上级决定，我们也就只好执行。于是昼夜不停地重新安排了工作。8月14日，专署移民委员会的电话又来了，他们指示：除了去甘肃省敦煌移民于8月20日左右走外，去青海省的移民在8月25日左右也要启程。这样，我们的工作就更紧张了。我们于8月15日又召开了移民干部紧急会议，布置了各项紧急任务。8月19日，忽然又接到专署移民委员会电话指示，说去甘肃省敦煌县的时间又推迟到9月1日至3日，原因是由酒泉到敦煌的汽车调运有困难，而且火车也有困难。当时我们曾几次要求提前走，但是没有被批准，我们只好再次重新安排工作。8月22日当去民和县的两批共二千五百名移民正往县里集中的时候，又突然接到专署移民委员会的电话说，去民和的二千五百名移民，8月25日走一千二百五十名，其余的推迟到9月9日走；8月26日走的由民和改移至湟源，原因是“火车有问题”；去甘肃省敦煌的移民由9月1日至3日推迟到9月6日至8日才走；去湟源的普遍推迟。当时我们提出意见说：去敦煌的移民走的时间，最好还照原来的计划；去民和县的两批移民，部分已集中到县，没办法再叫群众回去，在县里又解决不了吃、住问题。同时，要去湟源的在8月26日走也有困难，移民的行李还没有准备好。然而，上级又把我们的意见否决了。
    由于移民走的时间和地点的多次变更，出现的问题和给国家、给群众带来的损失都是很大的。首先，由于一变再变，移民的思想起了很大变化。张良乡移民纷纷要求提前走，否则就不去了。不少移民的生活也发生了困难。由于移民户思想上起了巨大变化，审批多次不能最后定案，影响到走前各项准备工作不能如期完成。第二、使今秋全县生产和各项工作，都受了很大损失。今夏鲁山县部分地区（主要是移民区、乡）遭受了严重水灾，干部和群众，本来应当集中力量搞好秋季生产，然而自7月中旬开始至8月底，数百名县、区、乡及农业社的干部，却把主要力量来进行移民工作了，不但移民户不能参加生产，也影响了其他群众的生产情绪。这里不去计算这些移民由于延期启程损失了多少个劳动日，减少了多少收入，仅仅政府多发放的救济款就是一万五千元。同时，移民准备的干粮，由于雨天多时间长，已经霉坏了一万八千斤。加上办公费用的多余开支，损失也在五千元以上。第三、由于时间的不断变更，行李集中到县，移民缺穿没盖，加之雨多天冷，许多移民生了病。总起来说，这次移民工作的无穷变化，在群众中大大损害了党和国家的威信。时间、地点的变化，我们县里是无权决定的，据说专署也没权决定，究竟责任应当谁负，我们还弄不清楚。但是时间、地点变动所引起的一系列的问题，我们曾向专署和省里再三反映，令人奇怪的是，省和专区移民部门不但不到县里视察一下实际情况，帮助解决一些具体问题，反而处处以“任务”，“决定”来代替解决实际问题，漠视群众疾苦，给下边的工作增加了不少困难。
    我们认为省和专署应该很好地接受这次教训，并且很好地检查自己的责任。
