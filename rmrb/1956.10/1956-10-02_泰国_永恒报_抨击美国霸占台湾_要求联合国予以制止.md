Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, 30th - The Thai newspaper "Eternal News" published an editorial on September 25th, criticizing the U.S. occupation of Chinese territory Taiwan as interference in China's internal affairs.

    The editorial pointed out that the important reason why the ambassadorial talks between China and the United States in Geneva have been dragging on for more than a year without reaching an agreement is because the United States wants to continue to place Taiwan under its protection in order to use Taiwan as its forward base in the Pacific.

    The editorial said: Taiwan is Chinese territory, Taiwan is a Chinese island. Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are Chinese, and the war between Chinese is an internal Chinese matter, just like the civil war between the North and South in the United States in the past. Therefore, other countries should not send armed forces to interfere in China's internal affairs, because this would clearly undermine peace.

    The editorial demanded that the United Nations review and stop this practice by the United States, otherwise peace in the Far East would be in a dangerous situation. The editorial believes that what method China uses to liberate Taiwan is China's internal affair, and foreign countries have no right to interfere.

    The editorial also criticized the embargo policy imposed by the United States on its allies, the purpose of which is to force China to submit to it, that is, to prevent China from using force against Taiwan. The editorial believes that Thailand should not be forced to implement an embargo against any country in order to interfere in other countries' internal affairs.

    泰国“永恒报”抨击美国霸占台湾
    要求联合国予以制止
    新华社30日讯　曼谷消息：“永恒报”9月25日发表社论，抨击美国霸占中国领土台湾是干涉中国内政。　　
    社论指出，中美两国在日内瓦举行的大使级会谈拖延了一年多还没有能达成协议的重要原因，是由于美国要把台湾继续置于它的保护之下，以便把台湾当作它在太平洋的前哨基地。　　
    社论说：台湾是中国领土，台湾是中国的岛屿。国民党和共产党都是中国人，中国人之间的战争是中国内部的事，正如美国过去南北部之间的内战一样。因此别国不应当派遣武装力量去干涉中国内政。因为这将明显地破坏和平。　　
    社论要求联合国审查和制止美国的这种做法，因为不然远东的和平就会陷于危险的境地。社论认为，中国用什么方法去解放台湾，那是中国内部的事情，外国无权过问。　　
    社论还指责美国强加在它的盟国身上的禁运政策，这种政策的目的是想压迫中国对它屈服，即不许中国对台湾使用武力。社论认为，泰国不应该为了干预别国内部事务而被迫去实行对任何国家的禁运。
