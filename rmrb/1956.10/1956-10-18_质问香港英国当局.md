	Questioning the British Authorities in Hong Kong
	On October 16th, Hong Kong Governor Alexander Grantham publicly stated to reporters regarding the Kowloon riots instigated by Kuomintang secret agents that it would be unfair to assume the perpetrators were Kuomintang members, and he implied that Premier Zhou Enlai's solemn protest and reasonable demands to the British government regarding this incident constituted interference in Hong Kong's internal affairs. The Chinese people cannot but feel extreme indignation and must lodge a serious protest against the Hong Kong authorities' attitude of persisting in shielding Kuomintang secret agents and deliberately distorting the facts.
	The large-scale riot in Kowloon was entirely created by Kuomintang secret agents. Residents, both Chinese and foreign, in Hong Kong and Kowloon witnessed this fact. Many reports from Chinese and foreign journalists confirmed this fact. Even the Hong Kong authorities cannot deny that the instigation and development of this riot was inseparable from the Kuomintang secret agents hanging and forcing the Chinese peaceful residents of Kowloon to hang the Kuomintang flag. However, at the very beginning of the incident, the Hong Kong authorities did not dare to condemn the Kuomintang in a single word. Subsequently, as the situation developed, they insisted that the riot was the result of internal factional struggles among Chinese. Those who engaged in wanton looting, arson, and murder were entirely Kuomintang secret agents and the thugs and hooligans under their command, while the peaceful residents of Kowloon were unarmed and innocent victims. We ask, how could anyone with a shred of conscience say that this was a struggle between two factions of Chinese? But it doesn't stop there; not only did the Hong Kong authorities' spokesperson say this, but Governor Grantham, while still in Tokyo, had already determined that the incident was partly hooliganism and partly a communist reaction to the Kuomintang. This is truly the most absurd thing imaginable. Now, Governor Grantham has gone a step further, and he doesn't even dare to say that the Kuomintang had any part in this incident.
	Governor Grantham attempts to use the old trick of "investigating the facts" to cover up the Hong Kong authorities' shielding and condoning of Kuomintang secret agents, but this will not succeed. The Chinese people have long seen through this trick. The Chinese people clearly remember how the Hong Kong authorities shielded those Kuomintang secret agent murderers who sabotaged the "Kashmir Princess" aircraft. In fact, there is no need to play these tricks. To put it bluntly, the real explanation for all of this is that the Hong Kong authorities do not dare to touch those Kuomintang secret agents. But if the Hong Kong authorities think that they can achieve peace in Hong Kong by doing this, then they are wrong, greatly mistaken. This policy of the Hong Kong authorities is playing with fire and will only encourage Kuomintang secret agents to cause even greater disturbances; and this is of absolutely no benefit to Hong Kong. At the same time, the Hong Kong authorities should know that the Chinese people will never tolerate Kuomintang secret agents using Hong Kong as a base to sabotage New China for long.
	Anyone with a little common sense will understand that the Chinese government cannot sit idly by while the Chinese residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon and its affiliated institutions and enterprises are threatened and harmed. Taking this riot as an example, the scope of the riot expanded so greatly, the duration was so long, and the Chinese peaceful residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon suffered such heavy losses, that even some British newspapers cannot help but doubt whether the Hong Kong authorities still have the ability to maintain law and order. Under these circumstances, Premier Zhou Enlai's protest and demands to the British government should be said to be absolutely beyond reproach. But the Hong Kong authorities actually implied that this was interference in Hong Kong's internal affairs; does the Hong Kong authorities really think that China can sit idly by while its compatriots are slaughtered? The Hong Kong authorities should know that the Chinese government has the full right to demand protection for Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon and for the institutions and enterprises affiliated with the Chinese government, and the Hong Kong authorities have the absolute obligation to be responsible for protecting them. The protest and demands made by the Chinese government to the British government are completely justified, reasonable, and legal.
	No sophistry or delay can shirk the responsibility that the British authorities in Hong Kong should bear for the heavy losses suffered by the Chinese peaceful residents in the Kowloon riots. The Chinese people firmly demand that the British government give a satisfactory response to the solemn protest and demands made by the Chinese government.

### 质问香港英国当局

    质问香港英国当局
    10月16日香港总督葛量洪就国民党特务制造的九龙暴乱事件向记者公开表示，如果认为肇事者是国民党是不公平的，并且暗示周恩来总理就这一事件向英国政府提出的严正抗议和合理要求是干涉香港的内政。对于香港当局这种坚持包庇国民党特务和蓄意颠倒是非的态度，中国人民不能不感到极大的愤慨，不能不提出严重的抗议。
    九龙的大暴乱是国民党特务一手造成的。港九的中外居民目睹了这一事实。许多中外记者的报道证实了这一事实。就是香港当局也不能否认这次的暴乱的发动和发展是同国民党特务悬挂并强迫九龙中国和平居民悬挂国民党旗分不开的。但是香港当局的发言人在事件的一开始就不敢谴责国民党一个字，继而随着事态的发展又硬说暴乱是两派华人内部派系斗争的结果。从事肆无忌惮的劫掠、烧杀的人完全是国民党特务和他们指挥下的暴徒和流氓，而九龙的和平居民则是手无寸铁的无辜受害者，请问，如果稍有天良的人，如何能说这是什么两派华人的斗争？但是，事不止此，不仅香港当局的发言人这样说，就是葛量洪先生在他还在东京的时候就已经断定这次事件一部分是流氓捣乱，一部分是共产党对国民党的事件。这真是最岂有此理不过的事。这一次，葛量洪先生更进了一步，他索性对这次事件连有国民党的份儿的话也不敢说了。
    葛量洪先生企图用调查事实的陈旧手法来掩盖香港当局包庇和纵容国民党特务的事实，但是，这是办不到的。对于这种手法，中国人民是早就看穿了的。中国人民还记得清楚，香港当局是怎样包庇那些破坏克什米尔公主号飞机的国民党特务凶手的。其实用不着玩弄这些手法。说穿了，所有这一切的真正解释是香港当局不敢碰那些国民党特务。但是如果香港当局以为这样做就能求得香港的苟安，那么它就错了，大大地错了。香港当局的这种政策是玩火自焚，只能鼓励国民党特务来闹更大的乱子；而这对于香港是绝没有什么好处的。同时，香港当局应该知道，中国人民是绝不会长此容忍国民党特务利用香港作为破坏新中国的基地的。
    只要稍有常识的人就会懂得中国政府是不能坐视在港九的中国居民和它所属的机关和企业遭受到威胁和残害的。以此次的暴乱而论，暴乱的范围扩大到这样大，持续的时间这样长，在港九的中国和平居民受到这样惨重的损失，以致英国的某些报纸也不能不怀疑香港当局是否还有维持治安的能力。在这种情况下，周恩来总理向英国政府提出的抗议和要求，应该说是绝对地无可非议的。但是香港当局竟然暗示说这是干涉香港的内政；难道香港当局真的以为中国可以坐视它的同胞遭受杀戮吗？香港当局应该知道，中国政府有要求保护港九中国同胞和中国政府所属机关和企业的完全的权利，香港当局有负责保护他们的绝对义务。中国政府向英国政府提出的抗议和要求是完全有根据的、合理的、合法的。
    任何诡辩和拖延都不能推卸香港英国当局对中国和平居民在九龙暴乱中遭受到的惨重损失所应负的责任。中国人民坚决要求英国政府对中国政府提出的严正抗议和要求作出满意的答复。
