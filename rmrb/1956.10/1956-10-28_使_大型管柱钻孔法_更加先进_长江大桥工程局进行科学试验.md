Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 25th: The "Large-Diameter Caisson Drilling Method," jointly created by Soviet and Chinese bridge experts and workers in the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, has been proven in construction to be a most advanced method for constructing bridge pier foundations. But can it be further improved? How effective is it under more complex hydrogeological conditions? Is its scope of use limited only to bridge foundation engineering? The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau is using scientific experiments to answer all these questions.

The experiments in this area, which have been underway for several months, are extensive. The areas selected for the experiments include various different types, and the caissons and machinery used in the experiments are also different. The purpose of this is to seek the rules for using the new construction method under various hydrogeological conditions and a reasonable operation process, so as to make it more perfect and then promote it in the foundation engineering of all bridges and other hydraulic structures.

Judging from the preliminary results obtained from theoretical demonstrations and experiments by Chinese and Soviet bridge experts, the development prospects of the "Large-Diameter Caisson Drilling Method" are very broad. For example, people have conceived of the following situation: since each caisson has the same processes from sinking to concrete pouring, and theoretically the larger the diameter of the caisson, the greater its bearing capacity, if the number of caissons used for each pier is reduced (even to one) while increasing the diameter of the caisson, wouldn't it save more time and materials? The question here is whether caissons with larger diameters can sink through the overburden layer at the bottom of the river to the bedrock. Preliminary results of the experiment show that large-diameter caissons with a diameter of three meters can be successfully sunk; the sinking experiment of caissons with a diameter of five meters currently appears to be proceeding smoothly. This shows that it is entirely possible to develop the new method to be more perfect than it is now.

According to relevant responsible persons, if all the experimental work achieves the expected results, the scope of use of this new method will be extended to all water conservancy projects, and even land buildings can adopt it. (Attached picture)

### 使“大型管柱钻孔法”更加先进  长江大桥工程局进行科学试验

    使“大型管柱钻孔法”更加先进
    长江大桥工程局进行科学试验
    据有关负责人谈：如果全部试验工作都得到预期的效果，那末，一切水利工程，甚至陆上建筑工程也可使用大型管柱钻孔法。
    据新华社武汉25日电　建设武汉长江大桥的苏联和中国桥梁专家同工人共同创造的“大型管柱钻孔法”，已经在施工中被证明是一种最先进的桥墩基础施工方法，可是它能不能进一步改善？它在水文地质情况更复杂的条件下使用效果怎样？它的使用范围是否仅止于桥梁的基础工程？所有这些问题，武汉长江大桥工程局正在用进行科学试验的方法来加以解答。
    已经开始了几个月的有关这方面的试验，内容是很广泛的。被选作试验的地带，包括有各种不同的类型，试验中用的管柱和机具也是各不一样的。这样作的目的，是为了寻求新施工方法在各种不同的水文地质条件下进行使用的规律和合理的作业过程，以便使它更加完善，并且进而在一切桥梁和其他水工建筑物的基础工程中推广。
    从中苏桥梁专家从理论上的论证和试验所获得的初步成果看来，“大型管柱钻孔法”的发展前途是非常广阔的。例如，人们曾设想这样的情况：既然每个管柱从下沉到灌注混凝土工序都是一样的，而从理论上看管柱的直径越大其承载力也就越大，假如在加大管柱直径的条件下减少每个桥墩所用管柱的数量（甚至减少到一根），不是可以更节约时间和材料吗？这里的问题是直径更大的管柱能不能够透过江底的复盖层下沉到岩盘上去。从试验的初步结果看，三公尺直径的大型管柱是可以顺利下沉的；五公尺直径的管柱下沉试验目前看来进行情况也是较顺利的。这就说明，使新方法发展得比现在更完美，是完全可能的。
    据有关负责人谈，如果全部试验工作都得到预期的效果的话，这个新方法的使用范围将会扩展到一切水利工程中去，甚至陆上建筑物也可以采用。（附图片）
