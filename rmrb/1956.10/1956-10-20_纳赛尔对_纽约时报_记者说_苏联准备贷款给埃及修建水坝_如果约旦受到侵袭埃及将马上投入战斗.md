Xinhua News Agency, 19th - New York Dispatch: According to a report in the "New York Times" on the 18th, Egyptian President Nasser said that the Soviet Union is prepared to grant Egypt a long-term loan to build the Aswan High Dam.

Nasser said in an interview with the newspaper's reporter, Baldwin, that the decision on this loan could only be made when he visits Moscow. He said that he did not discuss this issue with Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov during his recent visit to Egypt.

In the interview published on the front page of the "New York Times," Nasser accused the former international Suez Canal Company, which used to be a "state within a state," of sabotaging the canal's navigation. He said that the crisis over the pilots is now definitely over. Although winter fog and sandstorms are approaching, no management problems are expected.

Nasser said that Israel's recent attacks on Jordan are an attempt to give the impression that Egypt is incapable of assisting Jordan. However, Egypt is supplying Jordan with weapons to strengthen the Jordanian National Guard. He said, "If Jordan is attacked, we will immediately join the battle."

Nasser refuted the Western claims that Egypt has colonial ambitions and a "Nasser's empire." He said that this is a gross distortion of his belief that Arab countries must unite, and Africans and Muslims must cooperate.

    纳赛尔对“纽约时报”记者说
    苏联准备贷款给埃及修建水坝
    如果约旦受到侵袭埃及将马上投入战斗
    据新华社19日讯　纽约消息：据“纽约时报”18日报道，埃及纳赛尔总统说：苏联准备给予埃及长期贷款来修建阿斯旺高水坝。
    纳赛尔在接见这家报纸的记者鲍德温的时候说，等他访问莫斯科的时候才能作出关于这项贷款的决定。他说，在苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫不久前访问埃及期间，他没有和谢皮洛夫讨论这个问题。
    纳赛尔在“纽约时报”第一版刊登的这篇谈话中指责曾经是“国中之国”的前国际苏伊士运河公司破坏运河的通航。他说，现在，引水员问题的危机肯定地过去了。尽管冬季雾气和风沙马上就要到来，预料管理上不会发生问题。
    纳赛尔说，最近以色列攻击约旦，是试图给人这样的印象：埃及没有能力援助约旦。但是，埃及正在以武器供应约旦，来加强约旦的国民警卫军。他说，“如果约旦受到侵袭，我们将马上参加战斗。”
    纳赛尔驳斥了西方所谓埃及有殖民主义野心和“纳赛尔的帝国”的说法。他说，这是对他认为阿拉伯国家必须团结、非洲人和伊斯兰教徒必须进行合作的主张的大大歪曲。
