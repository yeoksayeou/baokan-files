Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 28th. The Vietnam Fatherland Front and the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace have jointly accused the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities of illegally formulating a "constitution" and holding a military parade in which the armed forces of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries participated.

    The Enlarged Central Committee Meeting of the Fatherland Front, in a statement adopted on October 26, pointed out that the purpose of the South Vietnamese authorities in formulating a "constitution" is to permanently divide Vietnam. The statement said that the Geneva Accords recognize Vietnam's sovereign independence, unification, and territorial integrity, and stipulate that the North and South should consult and hold national elections. The South Vietnamese authorities' illegal formulation of a "constitution" seriously violates the provisions of the Geneva Accords.

    The Peace Committee, in a statement, accused the South Vietnamese authorities of inviting warships and aircraft from Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries to Saigon to participate in the military parade commemorating the establishment of the South Vietnamese "Republic," calling it "a provocation against peace."

    Both organizations called on all the Vietnamese people to struggle for the unification of the motherland and the defense of peace in Indochina and Asia.

    越南祖国战线和和平委员会
    指责南越当局制订伪宪和举行军事检阅
    新华社河内28日电　越南祖国战线和越南保卫世界和平委员会一致指责吴庭艳当局非法制订“宪法”和举行东南亚集团国家武装部队参加的军事检阅。
    祖国战线扩大中央委员会会议在10月26日通过的声明中指出，南越当局制订“宪法”的目的在长期分割越南。声明说，日内瓦协议承认越南的主权独立、统一和领土完整，规定南北双方协商举行全国选举。南越当局非法制订“宪法”的行动严重地违反了日内瓦协议的规定。
    和平委员会在声明中指责南越当局邀请东南亚军事集团国家派军舰、飞机到西贡参加南越“共和国”成立纪念军事检阅的行动是“对和平的一种挑衅”。
    这两个组织都号召全越南人民要为祖国统一和保卫印度支那和亚洲和平而斗争。
