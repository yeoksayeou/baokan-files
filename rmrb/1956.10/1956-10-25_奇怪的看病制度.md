    Strange Medical System
    The First Outpatient Department of Jinan Railway Central Hospital has implemented a collective telephone appointment registration system for various work units. The system stipulates that each unit must designate a person to be responsible for calling the outpatient department first thing in the morning to register all the people in their unit who need to see a doctor. Then, according to the time arranged by the outpatient department, they must separately notify the patients to go to the clinic on time. Because the registration has to be done by telephone first thing in the morning, each unit has to ask its employees to register today for a doctor's appointment tomorrow. If someone gets sick, then they have to endure the pain for a day and delay treatment for a day.
    Recently, they have implemented a collective quota registration method in some railway workers' dormitories. It is said that this is to strengthen the "planning" of the outpatient department. The method stipulates that several dormitories jointly designate a person to be responsible for registering according to the fixed number of visits prescribed by the outpatient department. All employees' family members living in dormitories where this method is implemented will no longer be allowed to register, except for emergency cases. By doing this, the "planning" of the outpatient department has indeed been strengthened, because it can completely see patients according to the quota. But what is the effect? We can look at the facts after the "union" of Jinan Railway Second, Third, and Fourth Dormitories. These three dormitories house 159 families, with more than 400 children. However, the quota for pediatrics is only two per day, and after some struggle, it is only allowed to register four. A few days ago, many children were sick, and there were often more than ten children who needed to register for medical treatment every day. Therefore, registration is scheduled for 7:00 a.m., but even before 5:00 a.m., it is impossible to get a number. Children who cannot get a number have to either delay treatment or go to the pharmaceutical company to buy over-the-counter medicines to take indiscriminately.
    The employees and their families here are most afraid of the emergency room, because there are even more strict rules for emergency treatment. Taking registration as an example, the emergency department stipulates that no registration is allowed without a high fever. Therefore, some patients with sudden illnesses, restricted by planned registration and quota registration, are also blocked outside the gate of the emergency room by this regulation. The child of railway worker Wen Bo vomited severely, and his face changed. The child was in pain, and the adults were anxious, but because he did not have a high fever, he could not get an emergency number.
    These unreasonable systems have caused many difficulties for patients, and it is hoped that they will be improved as soon as possible.

    奇怪的看病制度
    济南铁路中心医院第一门诊部在各单位实行了集体电话预约挂号制度，规定各个单位指定专人负责在早晨一上班，把本单位看病的人员一次用电话告诉门诊部登记挂号，然后再按照门诊部安排的看病时间，分别通知病人按时前往就诊。由于一上班就向门诊部登记挂号，各单位只好要求职工今天登记，明天看病。如果谁生了病，那么就必须忍受一天的痛苦，拖一天再治。
    最近，他们在一部分铁路职工宿舍中实行了集体定额挂号办法，据说这是为了加强门诊部的“计划性”。办法规定：几个宿舍联合起来指定一个专人，按照门诊规定的看病定额人数，负责登记挂号。凡是住在实行这种办法的宿舍里的职工家属，除急诊外，一律不再挂号。这样做，门诊部的“计划性”确实加强了，因为它完全可以按照定额来看病。可是效果怎样呢？我们可以看看济南铁路第二、三、四宿舍“联合起来”以后的事实。这三个宿舍住有一百五十九户，小孩的人数在四百以上。可是小儿科的定额，每天却只有两个，经过一番斗争，也只准许挂四个。前些日子小儿患病的很多，每天经常要挂号看病的小孩在十个以上。因此，规定七点钟挂号，五点钟以前就挨不上号了。挂不上号的孩子，有的只好拖下去，有的就到医药公司买成药来乱吃。
    这里的职工和家属，最害怕急诊室，因为急诊的清规戒律更多。拿挂号来说吧，急诊规定不发高烧不准挂号。因此，有些突发病患者，受了计划挂号的限制和定额挂号的限制，又被这个规定挡在急诊室的大门之外。铁路职工文波的孩子，呕吐的很厉害，脸上都变了样子，孩子痛苦，大人焦急，可是因为没发高烧，就没有挂上急诊号。
    这些不合理的制度，给病人造成了许多困难，希望赶快改进。
