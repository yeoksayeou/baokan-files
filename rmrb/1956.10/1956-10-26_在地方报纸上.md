　　**Must Open Free Markets Under State Leadership**

　　On October 9th, the Jiangxi Daily published an editorial titled "Further Improving Market Leadership Work." The editorial stated that it is necessary to establish a portion of free markets under state leadership within the already formed unified socialist market in order to further invigorate the urban and rural economy and promote the development of industrial and agricultural production. The editorial pointed out that after the high tide of socialist transformation, the set of methods for managing the market in the past were not adapted to the needs of the developing situation in a timely manner, and too many restrictions were placed on the transformed small merchants and peddlers. Many restrictions were set on farmers' trade, which blocked the commercial channels that facilitated mass buying and selling, affected the expansion of material exchanges, and affected further satisfying the people's living needs.

　　In this editorial, four measures for improving market management in the future were proposed: First, it is necessary to widely develop farmers' trade. All agricultural and sideline products other than those subject to state unified purchase and entrusted supply and marketing cooperatives' purchase, as well as surplus products beyond the fulfillment of unified purchase and purchase contract obligations, can be freely sold in local or nearby markets. Commercial departments should change the past practice of managing the market with administrative orders and implement mass democratic management.

　　Secondly, encourage small merchants and peddlers to find their own sources of goods, restore their original purchase and sales relationships, and allow them to freely purchase and freely transport goods.

　　Thirdly, according to historical habits and the rational direction of commodity circulation, handicraft production cooperatives and individual handicraftsmen can purchase raw materials themselves, and after ensuring that state-owned commercial departments have priority in purchasing, they can sell their products themselves.

　　Finally, state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives should improve their management system under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels, actively carry out purchasing and supply work, and strengthen material balance and the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce; within the state-owned commercial system, the past method of allocating and matching goods from top to bottom according to administrative divisions should be changed. Lower-level stores should be allowed to freely select and purchase goods from any wholesale institution in the country.

　　The editorial also stated that some commercial department cadres worry that after the opening of the free market, it will be difficult to complete the plan of their own unit, the market will be chaotic, and even fear returning to the capitalist market. This worry is unnecessary. Because the elimination of mutual blockade will inevitably lead to mutual exchanges, and the scope of commercial activities will expand accordingly, the total volume of commodity circulation will inevitably increase accordingly. As long as the work is done well, the plan of a region or a unit can be completed. Some people think that the market will be chaotic, which is also a negative view. Because what is currently open is a free market under state leadership, the state will still rationally manage market prices; for major materials, the state will continue to implement unified purchase and sales, or advance purchase and order; state-owned commercial departments will still purchase some commodities that are allowed to be freely purchased and freely transported. Therefore, the state has the confidence to stabilize the market. The editorial concluded by saying that the free market we require to establish is fundamentally different from the capitalist free market. Our free market is based on the fact that agriculture, handicrafts, and individual commerce have embarked on collectivization, and capitalist industry and commerce have fully implemented joint state-private ownership, with the state market as the main body, and a free market under state leadership. This is a component of the unified socialist market and meets socialist needs.

　　**Supporting Sideline Production in Disaster Areas**
　　**Beijing Holds Materials Exchange Fair**

　　Xinhua News Agency: The Beijing Materials Exchange Fair, which focused on supporting production in disaster areas, closed on the 20th. During the six days of trading, representatives from about 300 trade units in 14 provinces and cities signed more than 500 purchase and sales contracts, with a transaction amount of more than 1.7 million yuan. The vast majority were to promote the sideline products such as bamboo and willow woven utensils and cooking utensils produced by farmers in disaster areas, and to supply them with the raw materials and daily necessities needed for sideline production.

　　At this exchange fair, the Beijing Native Produce Management Office of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives not only purchased more than 300,000 yuan worth of sideline products produced by farmers in disaster areas, but also adopted processing methods to organize farmers in disaster areas to produce a large number of vitex baskets. The Beijing Food Company specially reduced the price and supplied 350,000 jin of radish shreds to farmers in disaster areas to support their lives.

　　Many of the agricultural and sideline products sold by the supply and marketing cooperatives from various places at the meeting are currently needed in Beijing.

    必须开放国家领导下的自由市场
    10月9日江西日报以“进一步改善市场领导工作”为题，发表了社论。社论说，必须在已经形成的社会主义统一市场里，有计划地建立一部分国家领导下的自由市场，以便进一步活跃城乡经济，促进工农业生产发展。社论指出，在社会主义改造高潮后，由于对过去管理市场的一套办法没有及时适应形势发展的需要而加以改变，对改造后的小商贩限制太死，对农民贸易定了不少清规戒律，这样就使便利群众买卖的商业渠道受到阻塞，影响到扩大物资交流，影响到进一步满足人民生活需要。
    在这篇社论里，提出了今后改善市场管理的四项办法：首先，必须广泛开展农民贸易。凡是国家统购和委托供销社收购以外的农副业产品，以及完成统购和履行收购合同义务以外的多余产品，都可以在当地或附近市场自由出售。商业部门应该改变过去以行政命令管理市场的办法，实行群众性的民主管理。
    其次，鼓励小商贩自找货源，恢复原有的购销关系，允许他们自由收购，自由贩运。
    第三，按照历史习惯和商品流转的合理方向，手工业生产社和个体手工业者，可以自行采购原料，在保证国营商业部门优先选购之后，自行销售产品。
    最后，国营商业和供销合作社应该在各级党委统一领导下，改进经营管理制度，积极开展收购与供应工作，加强物资平衡与对私营工商业的社会主义改造工作；在国营商业系统内部，应该改变过去按行政区划自上而下分配、搭配商品的办法。允许下层商店向全国任何批发机构自由选购。
    社论还说，有些商业部门的干部耽心开放自由市场后，本单位的计划难以完成，市场会乱，甚至怕退回到资本主义市场。这种耽心是不必要的。因为取消了互相封锁，必然会互相往来，商业活动范围随着扩大，整个商品流转额必然会相应增加。只要工作做得好，一个地区、一个单位的计划是可以完成的。有人认为市场会乱，也是一种消极的看法。因为目前开放的是国家领导下的自由市场，国家仍然要合理的管理市场价格；对主要的物资，国家要继续实行统购包销，或预购定购；某些允许自由收购和自由贩运的部分商品，国营商业部门也还是要收购的。因此，国家有把握稳定市场。社论最后说，我们要求建立的自由市场与资本主义自由市场是根本不同的。我们的自由市场，是建立在农业、手工业、个体商业已走上合作化，资本主义工商业已全部实行公私合营的基础上，以国家市场为主体，在国家领导下的自由市场。这是社会主义统一市场的组成部分，是符合社会主义需要的。
    支援灾区副业生产
  北京市举行物资交流会
    新华社讯　以支援灾区生产为主的北京市物资交流会在20日闭幕。在六天的交易中，十四个省、市约三百多个贸易单位的代表，共签订了五百多份购销合同，成交金额约一百七十多万元，绝大部分是推销灾区农民生产的竹柳编器、炊事用具等副业产品，供应他们所需要的副业生产原料和日用百货。
    在这次交流会上，中华全国供销合作总社北京土产经营处不但采购了三十多万元灾区农民生产的副业产品，而且采用加工办法，组织灾区农民生产大量荆条篮子。北京市食品公司特别减价供应了灾区农民三十五万斤萝?丝，支持灾区农民生活。
    各地供销合作社在会上出售的农业副业产品，有许多是北京市目前需要的。
