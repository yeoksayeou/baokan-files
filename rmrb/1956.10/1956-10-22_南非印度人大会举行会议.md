Luthuli spoke of the challenge posed to all the people of South Africa by the South African government's brutal rule. He said that the policy of "racial segregation" has brought unspeakable suffering to thousands of non-whites, "We are witnessing the process of non-whites being deprived and denied of their democratic rights." He concluded by expressing his firm belief that, no matter what, "we will live to gain freedom in our lifetime."
