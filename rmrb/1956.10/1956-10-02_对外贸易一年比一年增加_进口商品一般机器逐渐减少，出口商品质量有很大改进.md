Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: China's foreign trade is developing rapidly. China's foreign trade has grown differently over the years. If we take China's total import and export trade in 1950 as 100, the figures are:
	1951: 143
	1952: 156
	1953: 195
	1954: 204
	1955: 265
It is estimated that this year will see new growth compared to 1955. Among them, the trade volume with the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries has increased the most. In 1955, it was about six and a half times that of 1950, and in the first half of this year, it increased by another 1.5% compared to the same period last year.

The proportion of China's trade with the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries in China's total trade has been continuously increasing, accounting for 33.5% in 1950, and has consistently accounted for about 80% in recent years.

China's trade with Asian and African regions has developed rapidly after the Asian-African Conference. The total trade volume in 1955 increased by about 18.4% compared to 1954; in the first half of this year, it increased by about 53% compared to the same period last year.

China's trade with Western countries increased by 368% in 1955 compared to 1952; but it has not yet recovered to the level of 1950. In the first half of 1956, China's imports from Western countries increased by about 23% compared to the same period last year, and China's exports to Western countries increased by 59% compared to the same period last year.

In the past six years, according to the needs of national economic construction, our country has imported a large number of machinery and equipment and materials necessary for construction. There are a total of 245 complete sets of equipment projects that have been imported and are being imported. The number of metal cutting machine tools that have been imported totals 20,693 units, petroleum and its products total 4.85 million tons, tractors total more than 12,000 units, superphosphate fertilizer totals 2.38 million tons, draft horses total more than 50,000, and other materials such as drilling rigs, cranes, railway vehicles, automobiles, steel plates, non-ferrous metals, and other means of production, as well as necessities for people's lives such as cotton, sugar, and medicine, have all been imported in large quantities.

With the development of China's industry, there have also been great changes in imported commodities. In the past one or two years, products that can be produced domestically, such as general lathes, cranes, various diesel engines, air compressors, textile machines, telephones, medical equipment, chemical raw materials, as well as bicycles, sewing machines, etc., are not only gradually decreasing in imports, but can also be exported. At present, the proportion of industrial products in China's export commodities is also increasing year by year.

The quality of China's export commodities has also been greatly improved. After the improvement of color silk and printed cloth dyeing technology, they no longer fade; the flavors of canned food have also been increased in many varieties according to the preferences of foreign consumers. Other light industrial products such as knitted goods, plywood, thermos bottles, refractory bricks, batteries, soap, toothbrushes, cultural supplies, and sports equipment have all greatly improved in quality. Therefore, the export volume of these commodities is constantly increasing. The sales areas of China's native and special products are expanding year by year. Currently, Chinese tea and Chinese native products can be purchased and consumed in Europe, Africa, Australia, Canada and other places.

    对外贸易一年比一年增加
    进口商品一般机器逐渐减少，出口商品质量有很大改进
    新华社1日讯　我国对外贸易正在日益发展中。我国对外贸易历年来都有不同的增长，我国进出口贸易总额如以1950年为一百，
    1951年为一百四十三，
    1952年为一百五十六，
    1953年为一百九十五，
    1954年为二百零四，
    1955年为二百六十五，
    预计今年将比1955年更有新的增长。其中对苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易额增长最大。1955年约为1950年的六倍半，今年上半年比去年同期又增长1.5％。
    中国对苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易额在中国全部贸易中占的比重不断增长，1950年为33.5％，近几年来一直占80％左右。
    中国同亚非地区的贸易，在亚非会议后有了较迅速的发展，1955年的贸易总额约比1954年增加了18.4％；今年上半年比去年同期又增加了53％左右。
    中国同西方国家之间的贸易1955年比1952年增长了368％；但还未恢复到1950年的水平。1956年上半年中国从西方国家进口的物资约比去年同期增加了23％，中国向西方国家出口的物资比去年同期增加了59％。
    我国根据国家经济建设的需要，过去六年来进口了大量的机器设备和建设必需的物资。已经进口和正在进口的成套设备项目共有二百四十五项，已进口的金属切削机床计有二万零六百九十三台，石油及其产品计四百八十五万吨，拖拉机计有一万二千多台，肥田粉计有二百三十八万吨，耕马五万余匹，其他物资如钻探机、起重机、铁路车辆、汽车、钢板、有色金属等等生产资料以及人民生活必需品如棉花、糖、医药等进口的数量都很大。
    随着我国工业的发展，进口的商品也有很大变化，近一二年凡国内能够生产的产品如一般车床、起重机、各式柴油机、空气压缩机、纺织机、电话机、医疗器械、化工原料以及自行车、缝纫机等，不但正在逐渐减少进口，而且可以出口。目前，我国出口商品中工业品的比重也在逐年增长。
    我国出口的商品在质量上也有很大改进。彩色绸缎和花布印染技术改进后，已不掉色；食品罐头的口味也根据国外消费者的爱好，增加了许多品种。其他轻工业品如针织品、胶合板、热水瓶、耐火砖、电池、肥皂、牙刷、文化用品、运动器具，在质量上都有很大提高，因此，这些商品的出口数量不断增多。我国的土产品和特产品销售地区逐年扩大，目前在欧洲、非洲、澳洲及加拿大等地都可以喝到中国茶，买到中国的土特产。
