Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 14th: Agricultural cooperatives in the disaster-stricken areas of Huaiyin, Xuzhou, Yancheng, and other regions in northern Jiangsu Province are urgently replanting winter wheat.

This year, the four special districts of northern Jiangsu have suffered successive natural disasters such as typhoons and floods. Some low-lying farmland is still flooded, some replanted late-autumn crops have not yet been harvested, some cooperatives lack wheat seeds, and some lack fertilizer. The state is supporting the disaster-stricken agricultural cooperatives in various ways. Before planting, the grain and transportation departments transported over 200 million *jin* of wheat seeds day and night to areas lacking seeds, and supply and marketing cooperatives supplied fertilizers and pesticides to control underground pests in advance. The autumn planting technology training courses held by the agricultural technology departments trained a large number of technical personnel for the agricultural cooperatives. The disaster-stricken agricultural cooperatives also received more than 30 million yuan in loans from the state.

Agricultural cooperatives where floodwaters have not receded are draining water while planting wheat, planting wherever the land is dry enough. Cooperatives where late-autumn crops have not been harvested are harvesting and planting simultaneously. As of October 10th, over ten million *mu* of wheat have been sown in various regions, and planting can be completed by the end of this month.

    苏北灾区抢种冬小麦
    各地已播种麦子一千多万亩
    新华社南京14日电　江苏省北部淮阴、徐州、盐城等地受灾农业社正在抢种冬小麦。
    今年苏北四个专区先后遭到台风、雨涝等多次自然灾害。现在有些低洼农田积水未退，有些补种的晚秋作物还未收获，有的社缺麦种，有的社缺肥料。国家从各个方面支援受灾的农业社。在播种前，粮食和交通运输部门，把二亿多斤麦种日夜赶运到缺种地区，供销合作社提前供应了肥料和防治地下害虫的药剂饵料。农业技术部门举办的秋播技术训练班，为农业社训练了大批技术人材。受灾的农业社还得到国家三千多万元的贷款。
    积水未退的农业社一边排水一边种麦，干一块种一块。晚秋庄稼未收的合作社，一边收一边种。到10日为止，各地已播种麦子一千多万亩，本月底播种可以结束。
