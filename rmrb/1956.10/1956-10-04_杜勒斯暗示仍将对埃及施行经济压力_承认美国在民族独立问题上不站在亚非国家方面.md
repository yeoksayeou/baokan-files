Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 3rd -- U.S. Secretary of State Dulles hinted at a press conference on the 2nd that the United States is still contemplating an economic boycott of the Suez Canal. He said that many people currently want to go around the Cape of Good Hope and are less inclined to have ships pass through the Suez Canal. Disregarding the fact that Egypt is maintaining the normal navigation of the canal and repeatedly guaranteeing the freedom of navigation, Dulles insisted that the "trust has been greatly shaken" in the normal navigation of the canal.

A reporter asked Dulles whether the United States intends to use its "surplus" cotton to force Egypt to accept a solution favorable to the West. Dulles said that Egyptian cotton has longer fibers than American cotton, and its uses are beyond the reach of American short-fiber cotton. However, he threatened that if necessary, the United States might find ways to disrupt the Egyptian cotton market to some extent.

When talking about the United States joining the "Users' Association," Dulles said that the United States "wants to sign agreements that only benefit the United States and have no obligations." This is an administrative agreement that does not require congressional approval.

A reporter asked if, since the end of the second London conference, there have been widespread rumors of disagreements between the United States and Britain and France on the canal issue; or at least differences in the degree of action taken.

Dulles answered this question by saying, "We have always had some differences in our approaches." He said that this region is not one that is bound to the United States by treaties, such as the Atlantic region, where the United States has an obligation to "protect" it. He expressed the hope that the West in the Atlantic region "will always be in complete unity."

Dulles indicated that the current Users' Association plan and past plans "have no discernible changes."

Dulles also said that the United States and Britain and France "are not always in complete agreement in their approaches" on other issues, citing colonialism in Asia and Africa as examples. Here, Dulles fully exposed the insidious face of the American hypocrite. Dulles acknowledged that there is a "very big problem" in these regions of "transition from colonialism to independence." He said that the role of the United States in these regions is to try to ensure that this transition process proceeds along what he calls a "constructive" direction, and to "not turn into a violent revolution." He said that the United States "neither sides one hundred percent with the colonial countries, nor does it stand on the side of the countries that are primarily and entirely concerned with achieving independence as soon as possible." Dulles indicated meaningfully that the United States "should play a special role" in these regions.

Dulles admitted that the United States has encountered "difficulties" in its relations with Panama. He acknowledged that American personnel involved in canal work, "whether military or civilian," "naturally have a tendency to want to enjoy certain privileges," and that these American personnel "also inappropriately did some things that competed with Panamanian merchants." In addition, there were "questions about wage standards and whether there was discrimination against Panamanian citizens."

### 杜勒斯暗示仍将对埃及施行经济压力  承认美国在民族独立问题上不站在亚非国家方面

    杜勒斯暗示仍将对埃及施行经济压力
    承认美国在民族独立问题上不站在亚非国家方面
    据新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯2日在记者招待会上暗示美国仍然在盘算对苏伊士运河实行经济抵制。他说，许多人目前想绕道好望角，而不那么想使船只通过苏伊士运河。不顾埃及维持运河正常通航的事实和再三作出的通航自由的保证，杜勒斯偏偏要说，各国对运河正常通航的“信任已经大为动摇了”。
    有记者问杜勒斯，美国是否打算利用它的“过剩”棉花来迫使埃及接受一个对西方有利的解决办法。杜勒斯说，埃及棉花的纤维比美国棉花纤维长，它的用途不是美国的短纤维棉花所能及的。但是，他又恫吓说，如果必要的话，美国可能找到在某种程度上捣乱埃及棉花市场的办法。
    杜勒斯在谈到美国参加“使用国协会”的问题的时候说，美国“要签订对美国只有好处而没有义务的协定”。这是一种行政性协定，无需国会批准。
    有记者问，自从第二次伦敦会议结束以来，普遍传说美国和英法之间在运河问题上发生了分歧；或者至少是在做法的程度上有分歧。
    杜勒斯对这个问题回答说，“我们在做法上一直是有些分歧的”。他说，这个地区不是由美国用条约连在一起的地区，如像大西洋地区那样，美国负有义务去“保护”它。他表示希望在大西洋地区西方“会永远是同心协力的”。
    杜勒斯表示，现在的使用国协会方案和过去的计划“并没有什么可以看得出的改变”。
    杜勒斯还谈到美国同英、法两国在其他问题上“在做法上也不总是完全一致的”，他举出在亚洲和非洲的殖民主义作例子。这里，杜勒斯充分暴露了美国伪善者的阴险面目。杜勒斯承认在这些地区存在着一个“从殖民主义转变到独立”的“十分巨大的问题”。他说，美国在这些地区的作用是要设法确使这个转变过程沿着他所说的“建设性的”方向前进，而要“不转变为暴力革命”。他说，美国“既不百分之百地与殖民国家为伍，也不站在主要和完全关心尽快取得独立的问题的国家方面”。杜勒斯耐人寻味地表示美国在这些地区“要起一种特殊的作用”。
    杜勒斯承认在美国同巴拿马的关系上遇到了“困难”。他承认同运河工作有关的美国人员，“无论是军政人员还是民政人员”，都“自然有着一种希望享受某些特权的倾向”，这些美国人员“也不适当地作了一些同巴拿马商人的生意有所竞争的事”，此外还有“关于工资标准的问题以及是否对巴拿马公民有所歧视的问题”。
