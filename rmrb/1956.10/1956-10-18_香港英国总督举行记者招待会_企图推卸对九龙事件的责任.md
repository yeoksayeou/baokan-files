Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th: Hong Kong dispatch: Hong Kong British Governor Alexander Grantham, at a press conference held yesterday, publicly stated that Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai’s solemn protest regarding the serious loss of life and property suffered by Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots due to the Kowloon riots instigated by Kuomintang special agents, was a so-called “interference in British internal affairs.”

Grantham said that he “couldn’t agree more” with the notion that Premier Zhou Enlai’s demand sounded as if it contradicted his policy of non-interference.

Although Premier Zhou Enlai’s protest was based on well-known facts already reported in Hong Kong and British newspapers, Grantham said that these facts were “inaccurate.”

Grantham’s press conference was held at 6:00 PM yesterday. Assisting in hosting the press conference were Hong Kong British Forces Commander Stratton, Colonial Secretary Davis, and Police Commissioner Peter Meredith. A so-called written statement regarding the Kowloon riots was distributed to reporters at the meeting. At the beginning of the press conference, Grantham said that this was the first “true” statement published regarding the entire incident.

At this press conference, Davis provided the latest casualty figures, reportedly as of 3:00 PM yesterday. According to Davis’s announcement, in this Kowloon bloody riot incident, there were 56 deaths, of which 40 were shot and 2 were injured by tear gas. Among the injured, 437 people were admitted to hospitals for treatment, and 134 of them remained in the hospital.

The above figures are greatly reduced compared to the facts-based reports in Hong Kong newspapers over the past few days regarding the deaths and injuries. It seems that the British side itself also knows that these figures are inconsistent with the facts, so Grantham said at the press conference that a full investigation must take some time to complete, and then the situation can be published.

A reporter asked him if the number of places looted reached hundreds. Davis said he thought it was less than that number. A reporter pointed out that the government did not mention the rape incidents reported by local newspapers in this statement. Davis actually prevaricated and said, "The government does not have any first-hand evidence to support this report."

Another reporter said that in London, someone asked why the army was not dispatched earlier. Grantham did not explicitly explain this issue, but still vaguely tried to shirk the responsibility of the Hong Kong British authorities for failing to quell the riots in a timely manner. Grantham said: In any such action, there will inevitably be this kind of speculation. But Grantham also said that the government is studying whether the actions during the riots were swift and effective enough.

Another reporter said that Tsuen Wan is the center of trade union activities, so in the opinion of this reporter, preventive measures should have been taken there first to avoid possible riots. The reporter asked whether any police forces had been transferred or specific preventive measures taken to prevent riots before any riots broke out. Davis emphasized that it must have been speculative as to where the riots would occur at that time. When the reporter once again asked why army assistance was not requested earlier, Grantham still did not give a direct answer. He tried to shirk responsibility, calling the question “almost impossible to guess.”

A reporter asked how to explain the fact that there were a large number of Kuomintang flags in Kowloon, and that it was safe to pass through Kowloon holding Kuomintang flags. Davis did not give a logical explanation as the Hong Kong "South China Morning Post" and the London "Daily Telegraph" did, namely: that this proved that the Kowloon riots were created by Kuomintang special agents. He vaguely said that it was undoubtedly due to the "Double Tenth National Day" and the troublemakers used these flags as symbols. Grantham also said that it was "unfair" to think that the troublemakers were Kuomintang members.

In answering another question, Davis said that the government has certain evidence that the Triads were involved. However, Davis admitted that he does not currently attribute all the responsibility to the Triads. He does not yet know the extent of the shared responsibility.

Davis said that he has no evidence to prove that the Communist Party was involved in this riot in any sense.

When a reporter asked if riots were still possible, Grantham said that the possibility of riots reoccurring always exists in Hong Kong and anywhere else.

The reporter also asked if the police had the ability to control those Triads in Kowloon. Meredith said that this question was difficult to answer. Meredith also said that they are now checking those who are currently detained, trying to determine whether they are really Triad members.

A reporter asked whether Hong Kong criminal law stipulates that people who have committed serious crimes such as participating in riots can be deported. Davis said that if the person is not a British subject, the law stipulates that he is already subject to deportation.

Someone asked whether the Hong Kong authorities intended to eliminate Kuomintang organizations. Grantham said that if anyone's actions are destructive, then whether he is right-wing, left-wing, or moderate, he will be deported.

### 香港英国总督举行记者招待会  企图推卸对九龙事件的责任

    香港英国总督举行记者招待会
    企图推卸对九龙事件的责任
    新华社广州17日电　香港消息：香港英国总督葛量洪在昨日举行的记者招待会上，公然认为我国周恩来总理对因国民党特务分子制造九龙骚乱事件而造成港九同胞生命财产的严重损失所提出的严正抗议，是所谓“干涉英国内政”。
    葛量洪说他对这样一种说法“再也同意不过了”，这种说法是：周恩来总理提出要求的口气听起来好像是同他的互不干涉政策是矛盾的。
    虽然周恩来总理的抗议是根据香港的和英国的报纸已经报道过的众所周知的事实的，但葛量洪却说这些事实是“不确实的”。
    葛量洪的记者招待会是昨日下午六时举行的。帮助主持这次记者招待会的有香港英军司令司特拉顿、辅政司戴维和警察总监比德米德。会上向记者分发了一篇所谓关于九龙暴动的书面声明。葛量洪在记者招待会一开始的时候就说，这是第一次就事件始末发表的“真实”的声明。
    在这个记者招待会上，戴维提供了到昨天下午三点钟为止的据说是最新的伤亡数字。按照戴维所宣布的，在这次九龙流血骚乱事件中，死者有五十六名，其中有四十人中了枪弹，两人受了毒气弹。在受伤的人中，有四百三十七人入医院治疗，而其中又有一百三十四人还留在医院。
    上述的数字较之几天来香港报纸的报道的根据的事实死伤是被大大缩小了。看来英方自己也知道这些数字与事实不符的，所以葛量洪在记者招待会上就说：充分的调查必须经过一些时候才能完成，那时情况才能发表。
    有记者问他遭到抢劫的地方数字是否达几百处，戴维说，他想，不到这个数字。一位记者指出：政府在这篇声明中没有提到本地报纸曾经报道的暴徒强奸事件。戴维竟然支吾其词地说：“政府没有任何第一手的证据支持这种报道。”
    另一记者说，在伦敦有人问，为什么不早些出动军队。葛量洪没有明确地说明这个问题，而仍旧含糊其辞地企图推卸香港英国当局没有及时平息骚乱的责任。葛量洪说：在任何这一种的行动中，不可避免地会有这类推测。但葛量洪又说：政府已在研究在骚乱期间行动得是否足够迅速和有效。
    另一个记者说，荃湾是工会活动的中心，因此在这位记者看来，最先原应该在那里采取预防措施以避免发生可能的暴乱事件。这位记者问道，在爆发任何骚乱以前，曾否调去任何警察部队，或采取过具体预防措施来防止骚乱？戴维强调说，当时究竟会在那里发生骚乱必然是猜测性的事情。当记者再一次问起为什么没有早一些要求军队援助的问题时，葛量洪仍然不作正面的回答。他企图推卸责任，把这个问题说成是“几乎没法猜测的问题”。
    有记者问，如何解释在九龙有大批的国民党旗帜和在九龙拿着国民党旗帜就可以安全通过的事实呢？戴维没有作出像香港“南华早报”和伦敦“每日电讯报”所作出的那样合乎逻辑的解释，即：这证明九龙骚动是国民党特务分子制造的。他含糊其辞地说，无疑是由于过“双十国庆节”，肇事者把这些旗帜当着标帜的。葛量洪还说，认为肇事者是国民党是“不公平的”。
    在回答另外一个问题的时候，戴维说，政府有一定的证据，说明三合会是有关的。然而，戴维承认说，目前他还不把全部责任归于三合会。他现在还不知道分担责任的程度。
    戴维说，他没有证据可以证明共产党在任何意义上和这次骚动有关。
    当记者问到是否还可能发生暴乱时，葛量洪说，再发生暴乱的可能性在香港以至任何地方都永远存在。
    记者又问警察是否有能力控制九龙的那些三合会，比德米德说，这个问题很难回答。比德米德又说，他们现在正在查对那些现在被拘留的人，设法确定他们是否真是三合会会员。
    有记者问，香港刑法是不是规定把犯了像参加骚动这样的大罪的人驱逐出境。戴维说，如果这个人不是英国臣民，法律规定他已有被驱逐出境的条件的。
    有人问香港当局是否打算清除国民党的组织，葛量洪说，如果任何人的行动具有破坏性，那末不论他是右的、左的或是中间的，都将被驱逐出境。
