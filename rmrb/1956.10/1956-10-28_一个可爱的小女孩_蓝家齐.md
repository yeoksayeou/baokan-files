The one who told me about this was Sun Yanxia, a young female typist at the Second Mining Company of Anshan Iron and Steel. With excitement, she recounted the whole story to me:

\tIn September, on a sunny Sunday afternoon, she went to the street to buy sundries and casually strolled into the beautiful 219 Park in Anshan City. The warm weather made her take off her uniform jacket, and at that moment, she didn't notice that the wallet in her pocket had fallen out. She didn't realize it until evening when she was preparing to go home. What made her very flustered and uneasy was that in this wallet, there were her work documents, fourteen yuan in cash, and a bank deposit book with one hundred and sixty yuan accumulated over the years. How unfortunate this was! Sun Yanxia returned to the places she had walked several times to look for it, but to no avail.

\tUnexpectedly, on that same afternoon, a neighbor in the dormitory brought her a strange letter. Upon opening it, ah, it turned out to be written by a little girl named Lan Jiaqi. The letter read: "Dear Aunt Sun Yanxia: On September 2nd (Sunday), my little brother and I went to 219 Park to play and picked up a wallet. When we opened it, we found fourteen yuan inside... I was so anxious that I didn't know what to do. I asked around in the park for a long time, but couldn't find you. Luckily, your name and address were inside, so I ran home to ask my mother to help me make a phone call, but it was so frustrating, I couldn't get through. I had no choice but to write this letter to tell you that I am keeping the wallet and money safe for you. Please come and get them!" At the end of the letter, she wrote her address and name in detail, even including the name of the unit where her mother worked.

\tThis young typist introduced me with immense emotion to the little friend she had encountered - she was just a twelve-year-old girl growing up in an ordinary family, with two braids, her mother teaching in a middle school, and herself a fifth-grade student in elementary school. She was a little shy when she met strangers for the first time, but from her bright eyes, it was not difficult to see that she was a good student at school and a good helper for her mother at home!

    一个可爱的小女孩——蓝家齐
    文天申
    告诉我这件事的，是鞍钢第二矿山公司的一个青年女打字员孙延霞。她以激动的心情向我叙述了这件事情的经过：
    9月份，在一个晴朗星期天的下午，她到街上选购杂物后，顺便漫步走进了鞍山市秀丽的二一九公园。温暖的天气使她脱下了制服的外衣，就在这个时候，没有注意放在口袋里的钱夹掉了出来。直到傍晚，准备回家时她才发觉。使她十分惊惶和不安的，是在这钱夹里，有她的工作证件，有十四元钱和逐年累月储蓄起来的一百六十元银行存折。这该是多不幸呵！孙延霞曾几次回到以前走过的地方寻找，可是一无所有。
    没有想到，就在这天下午，宿舍的邻居给她送来了一封陌生的信，拆开一看，啊，原来是个名叫蓝家齐的小女孩写的。信上写道：“孙延霞姑姑：9月2日（星期天）我和小弟到二一九公园去玩，拾到一个钱夹，打开一看，里面夹着十四元钱……，我急得不知怎么办才好，在公园里打听好久，也找不见您。幸亏里边有您的名字和地址，就跑到家里请妈妈帮我打电话，可是急死人，电话老打不通，只好写这封信告诉您，皮夹和钱都给您保存着，请来取吧！”信尾详细地写了她的地址姓名，甚至连妈妈工作的单位也都写上了。
    这个青年打字员无限感动地向我介绍了她所遇到的这位小朋友——她只不过是个生长在普通家庭中的十二岁的小女孩，扎着两条小辫，妈妈在中学教书，自己在小学五年级念书，初次和陌生人见面时还有些羞涩，但，从她聪明的眼睛中，不难看出她在学校里是个好学生，在家里是母亲的好助手！
