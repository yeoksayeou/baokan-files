    The Significance of Power Generation at the Shizitan Hydropower Station
    Li Rui
    China has extremely rich water resources and exceptionally favorable development conditions. Before 1949, there was also a certain foundation for hydropower construction, and the reconstruction of the Fengman Hydropower Station cultivated a reasonably strong basic construction force. However, regarding the development of hydropower construction in China, three questions remained without a generally accepted conclusion for a long time. These three questions were: (1) Can hydropower stations be built quickly enough to meet the requirements of electricity load? (2) Is the cost of hydropower stations truly cheap? (3) Do we have the ability to build large hydropower stations ourselves?

    The fact that the Shizitan Hydropower Station generated electricity in October this year can largely answer these three questions from a positive perspective.

    The Shizitan Hydropower Station generated electricity one year and two months ahead of the original plan, with a formal construction period of twenty-six months. Shizitan has a capacity of only 48,000 kilowatts, but in terms of engineering scale, it is a relatively large hydropower station; even so, the cost is still low. Due to adapting to geological and building material conditions, the structure of the Shizitan dam is relatively complex, and all the surveying, design, and construction was independently completed with the assistance of Soviet experts. These actual circumstances of the Shizitan Hydropower Station, especially in terms of speed and cost, make us more deeply aware of the unique and superior conditions for developing hydropower in China, thus providing a more powerful explanation for the correct policy of developing hydropower as much and as quickly as possible in our country.

    The main projects of the Shizitan Hydropower Station are as follows: the rockfill dam is more than one kilometer long and fifty-two meters high; there are three small earth-rock dams to block the low-lying gaps in the reservoir; a 1.5-kilometer-long water conveyance tunnel; a surge tank with a diameter of twenty meters and a height of forty meters; and a power plant and substation project. The total amount of stacked stone and earth-rock is 2.02 million cubic meters, and the various types of concrete total 340,000 cubic meters. Preparations for construction began in April 1954, formal construction started in August, and the first generating unit generated electricity in October 1956. This speed is considered relatively fast even in other industrialized countries, with a limited difference from the construction time of a thermal power plant of the same capacity in our country. As for large hydropower stations such as Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia, the construction period will be about five years, which should be considered a reasonably fast speed.

    The construction conditions at Shizitan were not ideal. For example, most of the equipment used in construction was old equipment from the Fengman Hydropower Station; external transportation relied on highways and barge transport from the Yangtze River, more than fifty-six kilometers away; new workers accounted for the vast majority of the workforce; and modifications and delays in surveying and design data often caused a series of passive situations. However, the entire project was still completed in a short period, mainly due to the full utilization and development of China's favorable construction conditions: construction can be carried out in all four seasons; some construction preparation work can be simplified as much as possible; there is a strong labor force, and cadres and workers have a spirit of hard work and perseverance, especially the stoneworkers in Sichuan have very high work efficiency. During the construction process, the Chongqing local authorities also provided the greatest assistance. In addition to this, there is another factor that needs to be particularly pointed out that played a decisive role in the speed of construction, which is first breaking with convention and overcoming certain constraints of the basic construction procedures. The Shizitan project was included in the plan very late, electricity was urgently needed, and there was insufficient preparation in advance, so construction had to start hastily, and the method of surveying, designing, and constructing simultaneously had to be adopted. Although this made the surveying and design very tense, caused a lot of hardship in construction, and even caused some unavoidable waste, the power generation time was advanced by more than a year. This approach was opposed at the time, saying it "violated the basic construction procedures"; some cadres responsible for design and construction also showed a lack of confidence at one point. In fact, the Shizitan project still basically followed the basic construction procedures. Due to the characteristics of hydropower construction, the entire process of surveying, design, and construction is long, technically complex, and involves many problems. In cases where the river planning scheme has been approved and the construction project has been determined, in order to save time, it is possible to do some preparatory work appropriately before the preliminary design is approved. After the preliminary design is approved, the technical design and construction drawings can be combined, and drawings can be issued according to individual projects (Shizitan was still designed in three stages, but the technical design had actually lost its function). In cases where the project period is very tight, it is possible and permissible to carry out design and construction simultaneously. The experience of Shizitan illustrates this point. However, it should be pointed out that doing surveying and design work as early as possible and making full pre-construction preparations can not only greatly reduce the difficulties and waste in construction, but also more reliably speed up the construction progress. Therefore, if conditions permit, doing surveying and design and construction preparation work in advance is still the best policy.

    The main reasons for the low cost of hydropower stations in China are the particularly favorable natural conditions such as topography and geology, and the small amount of engineering work per kilowatt; at the same time, the unit price of civil engineering is also relatively low. Among the hydropower stations that have been built and are planned to be built, Shizitan is the project with the worst topographic conditions, the most complex geological conditions, and the largest amount of engineering work per kilowatt, but the cost of the power station itself is still only 1,820 yuan per kilowatt. Shizitan is the uppermost level of the Longxi River and has a multi-year regulating reservoir; the three-level power stations below do not have reservoirs. After being regulated by the Shizitan reservoir, their reliable output and power generation will be greatly increased. If the four-level cascade power stations on the Longxi River are calculated on average, the cost per kilowatt is only 1,300 yuan, which is close to the cost of thermal power. The cost of hydropower stations in various countries around the world is generally much higher than that of thermal power plants. The Soviet Union is three to four times more expensive, and the United States, France, and other countries are also one to two times more expensive. The cost of smaller thermal power plants in China is 1,200 yuan to 1,800 yuan per kilowatt (excluding investment in coal mines and railways serving thermal power), and the cost of larger thermal power plants is about 1,000 yuan per kilowatt.

    Many river hydropower sites in China have excellent topographic and geological conditions, with steep river slopes. Building dams in canyon areas can obtain large power generation capacity and other comprehensive utilization benefits of the river with a very small amount of engineering work. Hydropower stations such as Sanmenxia, Liujiaxia, and Xin'anjiang all have this characteristic. The amount of engineering work directly affects the cost of hydropower stations. The hydropower stations built by the Soviet Union in the European region in the past were mostly on plain rivers, with gentle river slopes, wide river surfaces at dam sites, and most of the hydraulic structures were built on soft foundations. The amount of engineering work was very large, so the cost was particularly high. The hydropower stations recently built in Siberia have lower costs by one-third to one-half due to good natural conditions. The Shangyoujiang Hydropower Station in Jiangxi, which will generate electricity in the third quarter of 1957 (the construction time will be two months less than Shizitan), is built in a very narrow canyon area, the amount of damming work is very small, and the power plant is placed inside the dam, so the cost per kilowatt is only about 1,050 yuan, which is completely equal to the average cost of thermal power. Natural conditions have a great relationship with the cost of hydropower stations. The installed capacity of the Shangyou Hydropower Station is 60,000 kilowatts, which is larger than Shizitan; but the concrete is only 200,000 cubic meters, and the earth and stone is only 470,000 cubic meters, so the amount of engineering work is much smaller, so the cost per kilowatt is only 58% of Shizitan. Hydropower stations such as Sanmenxia, Liujiaxia, and Xin'anjiang, which have extremely superior natural conditions such as topography and geology, naturally have much lower costs, even cheaper than thermal power. Taking Liujiaxia as an example, the amount of concrete is about three times larger than that of Shizitan, the amount of earth and stone is similar, but the power generation capacity is more than twenty times larger than that of Shizitan. According to preliminary calculations, the cost per kilowatt is only a little more than one-third of that of Shizitan.

    The infrastructure investment of hydropower stations, excluding the cost of reservoir inundation losses, is mainly used for civil engineering, accounting for about two-thirds of the total project investment; the infrastructure investment of thermal power plants is mainly used for metal materials and equipment, also accounting for about two-thirds. China's civil engineering investment is much cheaper than equipment, metal materials, etc., compared to other countries. For example, the ratio of the unit price of each ton of rebar (representing equipment, metal materials, etc.) to the unit price of each cubic meter of large concrete is 100:7.15 in China, while it is 100:20-25 in the Soviet Union; the ratio of the unit price of each ton of rebar to the unit price of each cubic meter of tunnel rock excavation is 100:2.14-4.28 in China, while it is 100:7-10 in the Soviet Union.

    Regarding the choice of power source (hydropower station or thermal power plant), the amount of investment sometimes cannot be used as a determining factor, because hydropower stations, especially large hydropower stations, have comprehensive utilization benefits such as flood control, irrigation, water supply, and shipping in addition to power generation. The investment of hydropower stations with large comprehensive benefits should be reasonably shared by the various benefiting departments. The Soviet Union adopts this sharing method in the national investment plan. Therefore, in terms of the effect of investment, it is very cheap and cost-effective for China to build hydropower stations; in general, it can save national investment.

    However, the correct policy that China can build hydropower stations quickly and cheaply, that China should develop hydropower as soon as possible, establish industrial bases centered on large hydropower stations, and comprehensively solve the country's urgent needs for flood control and irrigation, has not been well implemented in recent years, and there have been hesitations. For example, many hydropower projects in the First Five-Year Plan were not determined after studying the rational cooperation between water and thermal power from the perspective of the development of the power system; on the contrary, hydropower stations were often considered only when it was really difficult to build thermal power plants. For example, hydropower was temporarily seized and the Shangyou River was developed because no coal could be found in southern Jiangxi; Dongchuan, Yunnan, also considered hydropower in turn because it was urgent to get electricity and thermal power could not solve it; Shizitan was mentioned and put down year after year from 1951, and it was almost cut off after being included in the plan in 1954, but when the Chongqing load increased, it immediately demanded to generate electricity one year in advance; the upper reaches of the Minjiang River hydropower station supplying electricity to Chengdu was also started very late and was prepared to be added to the plan. As for large hydropower stations such as Liujiaxia and Xin'anjiang, they were even more hesitant. The planning department had long believed that thermal power was enough for Lanzhou for a period of time, and it was not necessary to start Liujiaxia in the First Five-Year Plan; it was indeed generally recognized that it was not appropriate to develop more thermal power in Shanghai, but the plan for Xin'anjiang has been wavering, and any change in the view of Shanghai first cut off Xin'anjiang. Even now, not all comrades have a clear understanding of the issue that hydropower construction should be started as early as possible and pushed forward as much as possible to adapt to and promote the development speed of national industry and the entire national economy; when arranging plans, when faced with tight investment, important hydropower projects are still often postponed first.

    The reason for the above situation is mainly that we lack specific analysis and research on the conditions for China to build hydropower stations; in other countries around the world, hydropower is mostly more expensive and takes longer to build than thermal power, so it is inferred that China is unlikely to be an exception. At the same time, China's foundation for thermal power in the past was better than that of hydropower, and the comrades engaged in planning and power system design were more familiar with thermal power, and believed that thermal power development was convenient and easy to arrange in order to meet the needs of electricity load; while hydropower construction required overall consideration of the entire river and many problems, the process of surveying, design, and construction was very complicated, and it was troublesome to start early, especially underestimating China's existing hydropower construction force and lacking confidence. Therefore, for a long time, everyone had a kind of fear of building large hydropower stations, and always felt that the investment was large, the time was long, and there were many problems, "you can't rush, you have to take it slowly." The planning department once had a negative view on China's need to build large hydropower stations as soon as possible, believing that the "need for hydropower stations with 500,000 to 1 million kilowatts will be in five or ten years"; "there are many difficult problems in building large hydropower stations on the Yellow River, which are still difficult to estimate today"; "the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station will be considered in the Third Five-Year Plan along with the development of the aluminum industry"; "there is no need to rush to build the Huanren Hydropower Station in Northeast China," and so on. Why was there such timidity towards building large hydropower stations (here, the concept of "large" refers to Fengman and Sanmenxia, not the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River)? This is closely related to the dogmatic attitude towards Soviet experience.

    Before World War II, although the Soviet Union consistently attached great importance to hydropower construction, and initially stipulated correct principles such as comprehensive utilization, the development of hydropower was still relatively slow, with twists and turns and ups and downs. This was mainly due to the following three difficulties: (1) The power consumption center was in the European region, and the plain rivers such as Volga, Dnieper, and Don, as mentioned above, had very poor topographic and geological conditions. (2) The amount of earth and stone work in many projects was too large, and there was a shortage of labor and large construction machinery, so hydropower stations such as Kuibyshev, Stalingrad, and Kakhovka could not be started in time. (3) The problem of high-voltage transmission lines has not been fully resolved. Five years after the completion of the Dnieper Hydropower Station, the transmission line to Donbass was not opened until 1940; before this, because the reservoir was too small to regulate the flow, the electricity could not be sent out during the high-water season, and there was not enough electricity during the dry season, which caused many disputes. Due to these difficulties, coupled with some errors in river planning and insufficient geological surveys, the construction period of some hydropower station projects was very long, and even some changed designs midway, and the construction was reworked, which greatly increased investment. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, only 50% of the basic construction of the entire power industry was completed. Therefore, the Soviet Union's impression of hydropower construction at that time was that the investment was large, the time was long, and there were many problems; and the problem of large investment still exists today. After the war, due to the accumulation of rich experience and changes in objective conditions, the Soviet Union's hydropower construction entered a stage of rapid development: hydropower stations were first considered in the power system, river cascades were constructed one after another, large rivers in Siberia were developed, and the development of heavy industry and the entire national economy was promoted with large hydropower stations as the center. Only seeing the difficult side of the Soviet Union in the past, but not seeing the new development after the war; not specifically analyzing the differences between the conditions for the Soviet Union and China to build hydropower stations, but one-sidedly accepting other people's lessons, this is one of the important reasons why China's hydropower construction has long been unclear in its policy, indefinite in its plans, and unable to grow its strength early. Due to insufficient preparatory work in the past, projects that could have started earlier had to be postponed until 1957 or 1958 to formally start. As a result, not only are the urgent needs for hydropower in many areas difficult to meet in a timely manner; but also many projects are crowded together, creating a tight and passive situation for the entire hydropower construction work.

    Regarding the above three fundamental issues of China's hydropower construction, everyone's understanding is now more consistent, and the pace of all aspects of hydropower construction has also been greatly accelerated in the past two years. Therefore, starting in 1957, the five major hydropower stations in the country - Sanmenxia, Liujiaxia, Xin'anjiang, Yili River, and the upper reaches of the Minjiang River - will be officially started one after another, and China's entire hydropower construction will enter a stage of great development. However, looking back at the uneven road in the past few years, one cannot help but feel deeply that starting from the actual situation of one's own country, specifically recognizing the superior conditions for China to build hydropower stations, and thus correctly arranging the plan for hydropower development, is still a fundamental issue that we need to further solve in the future.

    狮子滩水电站发电的意义
    李锐
    我国水力资源极其丰富，开发条件十分优越，1949年以前水电建设也有一定的基础，丰满水电站的改建又培养了一支相当强大的基本建设力量，可是，关于我国水电建设的发展，有三个问题曾长期得不出一个公认的结论。这三个问题是：（一）水电站能不能很快建设起来满足电力负荷的要求？（二）水电站的造价是不是真正便宜？（三）我们自己有没有能力建设大的水电站？
    狮子滩水电站在今年10月发电的事实，大体可以从正面来回答这三个问题。
    狮子滩水电站比原定计划提前一年零两个月发电，正式施工时间是二十六个月。狮子滩的容量只有四万八千瓩，但就工程规模而言，是一座比较大的水电站；即使这样，造价仍是低廉的。由于迁就地质和建筑材料的条件，狮子滩拦河坝的结构比较复杂，而全部勘测设计是在苏联专家帮助下自己独立进行的。狮子滩水电站这些实际的情况，特别是速度和造价方面，使我们更深刻地认识中国发展水电事业的特殊优越条件，我国应当尽多尽快发展水电的正确方针从而得到更有力的说明。
    狮子滩水电站的主要工程如下：拦河堆石大坝长达一公里多，高五十二公尺；为堵住水库的低洼缺口，另有三座小土石坝；长一点五公里的输水隧洞；直径二十公尺、高四十公尺的调压井；以及发电厂房和变电工程等。全部堆砌石和土石方共二百零二万公方，各种混凝土共三十四万公方。1954年4月开始施工准备，8月正式开工，1956年10月第一台机组发电。这种速度，就是在其他工业发达的国家也算是比较快的，与我国同容量火电厂的施工时间相差有限。至于三门峡、刘家峡等大水电站，施工期限将是五年左右，应当说速度也是相当快的。
    狮子滩的施工条件并不算好，例如施工所用的设备多是丰满水电站的陈旧设备；对外交通靠公路和五十六多公里以外的长江驳运；工人中新工人占绝大比重；勘测设计资料的修改和不及时，常造成一系列的被动。然而整个工程仍能在短期内完成，主要是由于充分利用和发扬了我国有利的施工条件：一年四季可以施工；某些施工准备工作可以尽量简化；有雄厚的劳动力，干部和工人都有刻苦耐劳的奋斗精神，特别是四川的石工工作效率很高。在施工过程中，重庆地方上也给了最大的帮助。除此以外，还有一个需要特别指出的对建设速度起决定作用的因素，就是首先打破了常规，冲破了基本建设程序的某些束缚。狮子滩工程列入计划很迟，电要得急，事先准备不足，仓促开工，不得不采取边勘测、边设计、边施工的办法。这样做，虽然使得勘测设计十分紧张，施工中吃了很多苦头，甚至造成某些难以避免的浪费，然而发电时间却提前了一年多。这种做法，当时曾遭到反对，说是“违背了基建程序”；负责设计和施工的部分干部也曾一度表现缺乏信心。其实，狮子滩工程还是基本上遵照了基建程序的。由于水电建设的勘测、设计和施工全部过程长、技术复杂、牵连问题多的特点，在河流规划方案得到批准、建设项目业已确定的情况下，为争取时间，是可以在初步设计批准以前适当做些准备工作的。初步设计批准后，技术设计和施工详图就可以合并，按单项工程出图（狮子滩还是按三段设计，不过技术设计实际已失去作用），在工程期限十分紧迫的情况下，设计和施工交叉进行是可能的，也是可以允许的。狮子滩的经验说明了这一点。但是应该指出，尽量提前做好勘测设计工作和进行充分的施工前准备工作，不但可以大大减少施工中的困难和浪费，并且能更加可靠地加快施工进度。所以如果条件允许，事前做好勘测设计与施工准备工作仍为上策。
    我国水电站造价便宜的主要原因，是地形、地质等自然条件特别优越，单位瓩工程量小；同时土木工程的单价也比较低。在已建和计划修建的水电站中，狮子滩是地形条件最不好、地质情况很复杂、单位瓩工程量最大的一个工程，但电站本身造价每瓩仍只有一千八百二十元。狮子滩是龙溪河最上一级，有多年调节水库；以下三级电站都没有水库，得到狮子滩水库的调节后，都将大大增加可靠出力和发电量。如果把龙溪河四座梯级电站平均计算，则每瓩造价只一千三百元，与火电造价就相差不多。世界各国水电站造价一般比火电厂高得多，苏联贵三、四倍，美、法等国也贵一、二倍不等。我国较小的火电厂每瓩造价为一千二百元——一千八百元不等，较大的火电厂每瓩造价也达一千元左右（都不包括为火电服务的煤矿与铁路投资）。
    我国许多河流的水力地点都有极好的地形、地质条件，河流坡度陡，在峡谷区建坝，很小的工程量即能获得很大的发电能力以及河流的其他综合利用效益。三门峡、刘家峡、新安江等水电站都具有这个特点。工程量的大小直接影响水电站的造价。苏联过去在欧洲地区修建的水电站，多在平原河流上，河流坡度平缓，筑坝地点河面开阔，水工建筑物又大多建在松软的基础上，工程量非常大，所以造价特别高。最近在西伯利亚建设的水电站，由于自然条件好，造价就便宜三分之一到二分之一。将在1957年第三季度发电的江西上犹江水电站（施工时间将比狮子滩还少两个月），建在很窄的峡谷区，拦河坝工程量很少，厂房又是放在坝里面，所以每瓩造价只约一千零五十元，和火电平均造价完全相等。自然条件对水电站的造价有很大关系。上犹水电站装机容量六万瓩，比狮子滩大；而混凝土只二十万公方，土石方只四十七万公方，工程量小得多，所以每瓩造价只及狮子滩的58％。像三门峡、刘家峡、新安江等具有极优越的地形、地质等自然条件的水电站，造价当然就低得多，甚至比火电还便宜。以刘家峡为例，混凝土量比狮子滩约大三倍，土石方相差不多，而发电能力却比狮子滩大二十倍以上，根据初步计算，每瓩造价只及狮子滩的三分之一强。
    水电站的基建投资除水库淹没损失费用外，主要用在土建工程方面，约占全部工程投资的三分之二；火电厂的基建投资主要用在金属材料和设备方面，也约占三分之二。我国的土建工程投资同设备、金属材料等相较，比其他国家便宜得多，例如我国每吨钢筋（代表设备、金属材料等）的单价与每公方大块混凝土单价之比为100∶7.15，苏联则为100∶20—25；我国每吨钢筋的单价与每公方隧洞石方开挖单价之比为100∶2.14—4.28，苏联则为100∶7—10。
    关于电源（水电站或火电厂）的选择，投资多寡有时不能作为决定的因素，因为水电站特别是大水电站除发电以外，还有防洪、灌溉、给水、航运等综合利用效益。综合效益大的水电站的投资自应由各受益部门合理分摊，苏联在国家投资计划中就是采取这种分摊办法的。所以从投资的效果来说，我国建设水电站是非常便宜、非常合算的；在总的方面，可以节省国家投资。
    可是，对于中国修建水电站能够做到又快又便宜，我国应当尽快发展水电事业，以大水电站为中心建立工业基地并综合解决国家防洪、灌溉等迫切要求，这样一种正确的方针，几年来并没有得到很好的贯彻，曾经有过摇摆不定。譬如第一个五年计划中的许多水电项目，并不是从电力系统的发展出发，研究水火电的合理配合后加以确定的；相反的，往往是在建设火电厂实在有困难时，才被迫考虑修建水电站。例如，在赣南找不到煤，才临时抓水电，开发上犹江；云南东川也曾因急于要电，火电解决不了，才回头考虑水电；狮子滩从1951年起，曾年年提起来放下去，1954年列入计划后又几乎削掉，后来重庆负荷一上升，马上又要求提前一年发电；供电成都的岷江上游水电站，也是动手很迟，准备补列入计划的。至于刘家峡和新安江等大水电站，更是举棋不定，计划部门曾长期认为兰州一个时期内靠火电就够了，刘家峡不必要列在第一个五年计划内开工；上海确实公认为不宜再多发展火电，可是新安江的计划一直动摇，对于上海的看法一有变动，就首先削掉新安江。直到现在，关于水电建设应当及早动手，尽可能往前赶一步，以适应和推动国家工业和整个国民经济的发展速度的问题，并不是所有的同志都有了明确的认识；在安排计划的时候，遇到投资紧张，重要的水电项目仍常常不免被首先推后。
    产生以上情况的原因，主要是我们对中国修建水电站的条件缺乏具体的分析研究；世界上其他国家大都是水电比火电贵，建设时间长，也就从而推论中国难以例外。同时我国过去火电的基础比水电的好，从事计划和电力系统设计的同志都比较熟习火电，认为火电发展起来方便，为了满足电力负荷的需要，火电厂建设快，也容易摆布；而水电建设需要对整个河流和许多问题作通盘考虑，勘测设计和施工的过程很复杂，对及早动手感到麻烦，特别是对我国已有的水电建设力量估计不足，信心不够。因此，长期以来，大家对修建大水电站存有一种疑惧心理，总觉得投资大，时间长，问题多，“不能着急，得慢慢来”。计划部门对于我国应当及早修建大水电站就曾经有过一种否定的看法，认为五十至一百万瓩的水电站，其“需要当在五年或十年以后”；“在黄河建造大水电站，存在许多困难问题，今天尚难估计”；“三门峡水电站要到第三个五年计划随着制铝工业的发展来考虑”；“东北的桓仁水电站不必急于建设”，等等。为什么对修建大水电站（这儿“大”的观念是指丰满和三门峡之类，非指长江三峡）曾经这样畏缩呢？这与对待苏联经验的教条主义态度是有密切关系的。
    苏联在二次大战之前，虽然一贯非常重视水电建设，并且最初就规定了综合利用等正确原则，但水电的发展还是比较缓慢的，还有波折和高潮起伏。这主要由于有以下三个困难：（一）用电中心在欧洲地区，而伏尔加、德聂泊、顿河等平原河流，如前所述，地形、地质条件很不好。（二）许多工程土石方数量太大，加以劳动力不足，缺乏大型建筑机械，如古比雪夫、斯大林格勒、卡霍夫卡等水电站都不能及时动手。（三）高压输电线问题没有全部解决。德聂泊水电站建成五年后，1940年才修通顿巴斯的输电线路；在这以前，因水库太小，不能调节流量，丰水时电送不出去，枯水时电又不够，曾引起许多争论。由于这些困难，加以河流规划中的某些错误和地质勘查作得不够，有些水电站工程的工期拖得很长，甚至有的中途改变设计，建筑返工，更大大增加投资。在第二个五年计划期间，整个电业的基本建设只完成了50％。因此，苏联当时对水电建设的印象是投资大、时间长、问题多；而投资大的问题，是一直到现在还存在的。在战后，由于积累了丰富的经验，客观条件有了改变，苏联的水电建设就进入飞跃发展的阶段：电力系统中首先考虑修水电站，河流梯级接连施工，开发西伯利亚大河流，以大水电站为中心推动重工业和整个国民经济的发展。只看到苏联过去困难的一面，而不看到战后新的发展；不具体分析苏联同我国建设水电站的条件的差别，而片面接受人家的教训，这就是我国水电建设曾经长期方针不明、计划不定、力量得不到及早生长的重要原因之一。由于过去准备工作做得不够，就使得本来可以提早开工的工程都不得不推迟到1957年或1958年才能正式开工。结果，不仅许多地区对水电的急迫要求难以及时得到满足；而且许多工程挤在一起，造成整个水电建设工作的紧迫和被动的局面。
    关于上述我国水电建设的三个根本问题，现在大家的认识比较一致了，这两年来也大大加快了水电建设各个环节的步伐，因而从1957年起，全国五大水电站——三门峡、刘家峡、新安江、以礼河和岷江上游，都将先后正式开工，我国整个水电建设将进入大发展的阶段。但是回顾这几年来不平坦的道路，不能不使人深深感觉到，从自己国家的实际情况出发，具体认识我国建设水电站的优越条件，从而正确安排水电发展的计划，仍是我们今后需要更进一步解决的带根本性质的问题。
