    Today's Fengman Hydropower Station
    --One of a series of visits to Fengman
  　By Our Correspondent Chen Ji
    A huge dam, over ninety meters high and over a thousand meters long, stands between two small peaks, cutting off the Songhua River.
    The source of the Songhua River—Tianchi Lake on the main peak of Changbai Mountain, Baitou Mountain—is located at an altitude of more than two thousand seven hundred meters. It is twenty kilometers in circumference and three hundred and ten meters deep. Legend has it that three fairies once bathed here, splashing the heavenly water onto the earth. The inexhaustible water flows out from a large gap, as if descending from the sky, forming the mighty flow of the Songhua River.
    When the mighty Songhua River flows to Fengman, it is blocked by a large dam built with four to five million tons of concrete. The upper reaches of the Songhua River become a large reservoir hundreds of kilometers long—Songhua Lake. Its water storage capacity is greater than the sum of the three major reservoirs of Guanting, Boshan, and Foziling. It has more than two hundred and seventy kilometers of navigation routes and produces several million catties of bream, crucian carp, whitefish, and carp annually.
    This large dam is the famous Fengman Hydropower Station's river-blocking dam. It ensures sufficient hydraulic power to drive the hydro-generators; and during the flood season, it blocks floods and eliminates water damage to 160,000 hectares of farmland.
    In the early days of Liberation, this large dam was very unstable and could easily collapse if it encountered a major flood. This was because when the dam was built in 1937, Japanese imperialism attempted to plunder Chinese resources as soon as possible, disregarding the quality of the project and accelerating construction. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the dam leaked everywhere and was riddled with holes. The largest holes could fit a table. The concrete work of the dam was only 85% completed. The reactionary rulers of the Kuomintang not only did not change the dangerous situation of the dam, but also passively reduced the dam's ability to block water. The American engineer Carden, hired by the Kuomintang, mistakenly suggested lowering the spillway of the dam to prevent the impact of floods.
    On March 9, 1948, Fengman was liberated. Our Party led the workers of Fengman to quickly heal the wounds of the dam, complete the unfinished work of the dam, and comprehensively renovate and expand the Fengman Hydropower Station.
    Strangely enough, before Liberation, the Fengman Dam did not encounter a single major flood, but after Liberation, it encountered three major floods. The major flood of 1953 was unprecedented in a century. But our renovated Fengman Dam remained safe and sound. Engineers said: If the Fengman Dam had encountered the type of major flood of 1953 before Liberation, it would have collapsed long ago.
    In early September this year, we came to Fengman and saw that the dam was very strong and could safely withstand a major flood that occurs once in a thousand years.
    Li Peng, the deputy director of the Fengman Hydropower Station, gave me a recent inspection report on the renovation and expansion project of the Fengman Hydropower Station. The report begins by stating: The Fengman Hydropower Hub is basically in a state that can ensure normal operation. Both the inside and outside of the dam have been poured with concrete. Before Liberation, the dam body leaked four hundred liters of water per second; now it only leaks more than seventeen liters per second. The concrete poured into the dam foundation in 1950 showed no signs of damage after more than four years of water immersion, freezing, and weathering. Even the model imprints on the surface of the concrete are very clear; however, all the concrete poured during the puppet Manchurian period has been eroded, and some of the eroded thickness has reached thirty millimeters. These contrasting facts mark the improvement of the technical level of the Chinese working class.
    The restoration and renovation of the Fengman Dam project were completed in a very short period of time. In 1949, the emergency repair of the dam began; and by 1953, the restoration and renovation project was completed. The quality of the project was also good, and the adoption of advanced Soviet technology was very successful. Just one thing can illustrate the brilliant achievements of this advanced technology.
    During this year's flood season, the dam once opened the gates to release floodwater. The floodwater, with a flow rate of four thousand cubic meters per second, poured out like a mountain overturning the sea from the spillway dozens of meters high, forming a huge waterfall. It flowed to the crescent-shaped differential stilling basin downstream of the dam foundation, suddenly leaped into the air, and was thrown one hundred and fifty meters away, turning into wisps of cloud-like water flowers more than a thousand meters long, and then gently flowed downstream.
    When we first saw this water leaping, we didn't know what was going on. I thought: The torrents like waterfalls released from the spillway will break through the dam foundation, won't they? They will erode the riverbed, won't they? But the engineers said, no! Our newly built differential stilling basin throws the torrents into the distance, minimizing the destructive power of the huge water energy. The flood released in 1953 was much larger than this year, and the riverbed and dam foundation remain unchanged. This differential stilling basin is an advanced facility researched and developed by the All-Soviet Institute of Hydraulic Engineering Science in Leningrad, Soviet Union. With this facility, the Fengman Dam is not afraid of flood erosion.
    Now all eleven spillways of the dam have gates; after the flood, the gates are tightly closed to prevent water from flowing away in vain. The lower half of the spillway that American engineer Carden suggested blowing up has also been repaired. The current top of the dam is almost one meter higher than during the puppet Manchurian period. The powerful dam reliably guarantees the water source for power generation.
    On the east side downstream of the Fengman Dam, there is a rectangular factory that is integrated with the dam. From a distance, this factory looks like a small tramcar, quietly lying at the foot of the tall dam. In fact, this factory is also very large, it is one hundred and eighty-nine meters long and more than twenty-seven meters high. Because the dam is too large, it looks very small. This factory is where Fengman generates electricity.
    Before coming to the Fengman Hydropower Station, I couldn't understand how huge amounts of electricity were generated. After seeing it, I understood. It turns out that a row of very large, invisible penstocks are buried inside the dam. Each of these penstocks weighs more than four thousand tons, is six meters in diameter, and more than one hundred meters long, and stands obliquely in the reservoir and dam like an inverted pagoda. When generating electricity, it only takes a few minutes to open the water intake gate and the main valve controlling the water volume. The water passes through the penstock from a very high place and rushes the turbine to rotate rapidly with the force of thunder, driving the generator to continuously generate electricity. Then the water flows downstream from the tailrace. The turbine uses a large shaft to drive the generator. This large shaft is as tall as a four-story building and about one meter in diameter. When it rotates, the wind rises and the sound is like thunder.
    We walked into the power plant and only saw the head of a huge generator surrounded by an iron ring, with various handles, instruments, and lines. We heard a whirring sound, knowing that huge amounts of electricity were being generated here and sent to cities such as Jilin, Changchun, Shenyang, Fushun, Anshan, and Harbin; but we didn't see many workers. Only a few duty officers sat at the table, copying records. Sometimes, they looked at the instruments or walked near the turbine. In a beautiful, air-fresh master control room, several duty officers in white clothes sat in chairs, quietly observing the red, green, white, and blue lights, mastering and controlling the operation of the entire plant's power generation and transmission work.
    Chief Engineer Zhang Wenbin told us: "Now one of our duty officers can manage two sets of hydro-generators; during the puppet Manchurian period, three duty officers managed only one set of hydro-generators. This is a sign of the complete automation of our factory after renovation and expansion."
    Complete automation—this is one of the main contents of the renovation and expansion project of the Fengman Hydropower Station.
    In 1953, Fengman Hydropower Station completed the dam project and began the renovation and expansion of the equipment. At that time, there were only sixty or so installation workers, and almost none of them really understood the technology of installing motors. When installing the first Soviet-style automated hydro-generator, some people thought it would take at least eight months; later, with the help of Soviet experts, it was installed in only three months. Soviet experts told the workers: "We will do the installation of the first one, and you will watch; you will do the installation of the second one, and we will watch; you will do the installation of the third one, and we will not even watch." This requirement was realized ahead of schedule. The first batch of Chinese technical forces to install hydroelectric equipment grew rapidly. The original team of more than sixty people who did not understand installation technology has developed into a large army of more than two thousand people who have mastered the technology. They have independently installed a lot of hydroelectric power generation equipment in Fengman and many other places in the country. Through their efforts, the installation equipment project and the renovation of old equipment into fully automated projects stipulated in the first five-year plan of the Fengman Hydropower Station have now been fully completed. Only one hydro-generator is temporarily not installed. When this hydro-generator is installed, the power generation capacity of the Fengman Hydropower Station will reach 567,000 kilowatts.
    The installation of new equipment and the renovation of old equipment have improved the power generation capacity of the Fengman Hydropower Station and pushed the Fengman Hydropower Station onto the road of complete automation. The size of the latest Soviet-style hydro-generator is the same as the old-fashioned hydro-generator during the puppet Manchurian period, but it has 15,500 kilovolt-amperes more capacity than the old-fashioned one. The current power generation capacity is more than twice as high as in the early days of Liberation. A series of automated devices for power generation, transformation, and transmission greatly reduce heavy labor, and at the same time, ensure power generation and transmission well, quickly, and safely. When generating electricity, people sit in the room and turn on the button, without having to run to the machine to operate it by hand as in the past. During the puppet Manchurian period, if an accident occurred, it would take at least twenty minutes to restore power transmission. Now, with the installation of a set of automatic equipment, it takes only one minute from starting to restoring power transmission. Recently, the Fengman Hydropower Station also built a new type of device called a line relay protection device. With this device, when a fault occurs on a long high-voltage transmission line, it will automatically trip the circuit breaker to prevent the expansion of the accident. If the accident is not a permanent damage, it will automatically close the circuit breaker and restore power transmission. The total time required for this tripping and closing is only 0.3 seconds. Zero point three seconds is an instantaneous change, and there is almost no feeling of power outage. In the past, without this type of automatic device, when a fault occurred on the line, people were extremely nervous and rushed to restore power transmission, which would take at least half an hour. Now these automation devices are still being improved. The purpose of the improvement is to change some of the work that currently requires people to do, to be done by the machines themselves. We know that some hydropower stations in the Soviet Union are closed; production personnel live far away and operate the equipment of the entire plant. This wonderful prospect is also the direction of the efforts of the Fengman Hydropower Station.

    今日丰满水电站
    ——丰满访问记之一
  　本报记者　陈迹
    一座九十多公尺高、一千多公尺长的大堤坝，屹立在两座小峰之间，拦腰斩断了松花江。
    松花江的发源地——长白山主峰白头山上的天池，处在拔海两千七百多公尺的白头山上，周围二十公里，水深三百一十公尺。相传曾有三个仙女在这里洗澡，把天水泼给人间。流不尽的大水，从一大缺口流出，像从天上降下，形成了松花江的巨流。
    松花江浩浩荡荡流到丰满的时候，就被四、五百万吨重的用混凝土修筑的大堤坝挡住了。松花江的上游变成一座长达几百公里的大水库——松花湖。它的蓄水量比官厅、薄山和佛子岭三大水库蓄水量的总和还要大，拥有二百七十多公里航线，年产几百万斤鳊鱼、鲫鱼、白鱼和鲤鱼。
    这座大堤坝，就是丰满水电站著名的拦河坝。它保证以足够的水力带动水轮发电机；并在汛期堵住洪水，消除十六万公顷良田的水害。
    解放初期，这座大堤坝很不稳固，要是遇上大洪水，就很可能被冲倒。这是因为1937年修筑这座大堤坝的时候，日本帝国主义企图早
  日来掠夺中国资源，不顾工程质量，加速建设。抗战胜利以后，堤坝到处漏水，百孔千疮，最大的窟窿能放进一张桌子。堤坝的混凝土工程，只完成85％。国民党反动统治者不但没有改变堤坝的危险状况，而且消极地降低了堤坝拦水的能力。国民党聘请的美国工程师卡登错误地建议采取炸低堤坝溢流口的办法，来防止洪水的冲击。
    1948年3月9日，丰满解放了。我们的党，领导丰满职工，很快治好了大堤坝的创伤，完成了堤坝未完的工程，并且全面改建和扩建了丰满水电站。
    说也奇怪，解放以前，丰满堤坝没有遇到一次大洪水，解放以后，却遇到三次大洪水。1953年的一次大洪水，是百年所未有的。但是我们改建好的丰满堤坝却安然无恙。工程师们说：要是在解放前，丰满堤坝遇到1953年类型的大洪水，早就倒塌了。
    今年9月初，我们来到丰满，看到大堤坝很牢固，可以安全度过千年难遇的大洪水了。
    丰满水电站副厂长李鹏给我一份最近的关于丰满水电站改建和扩建工程的检查报告。这份报告一开头就说：丰满水电枢纽已基本上处于可以保证正常运行的状态。堤坝的内部和外部，都浇注了混凝土。解放前，坝体内每秒钟漏水四百公升；现在每秒钟只漏水十七公升多。1950年在坝基灌注的混凝土，经过四年多的水浸、冰冻和风化，都没有丝毫破坏的痕迹，甚至连混凝土表面的模型印纹都很清楚；然而凡是伪满时期灌注的混凝土，都已经剥蚀，有的剥蚀掉的厚度竟达三十公厘。这些对比的事实，标志了中国工人阶级的技术水平的提高。
    恢复和改建丰满堤坝工程，是在很短时间内完成的。1949年，开始抢修堤坝；到1953年，就完成了恢复和改建工程。工程的质量也好，采用苏联先进技术也是很成功的。只要举出一件事情，就可以看出这种先进技术的辉煌成就。
    今年洪水季节，大堤坝一度开了闸门，放出洪水。洪水以每秒钟四千立方公尺的流量，排山倒海地从几十公尺高的溢流口流出，形成巨大的瀑布，流到坝基下游的月牙形的差动式跃水坎上，忽然跃上高空，抛往一百五十公尺的远方，变成缕缕向上飞腾的一千多公尺长的云雾般的水花，然后轻轻地流往下游。
    我们初次看到这种跃水的情景，不知道是怎么回事。我想：从溢流口放出的瀑布一样的急流，总会冲破坝基吧，总会刷坏河床吧。但是，工程师说，不会的！我们新建的差动式跃水坎，把急流抛往远方，尽量减少巨大水能的破坏力量。1953年放出的洪水比今年大得多，河床和坝基都不变样。这种差动式跃水坎，是苏联列宁格勒全苏水工科学研究院研究成功的先进设施。丰满堤坝有了这种设施，就不怕洪水的冲刷了。
    现在大堤坝十一个溢流口，都有了闸门；洪水过后，闸门紧闭，不让水白白流掉。过去美国工程师卡登建议炸掉的溢流口下半部，也已经修复。目前的坝顶，比伪满时期几乎高出一公尺。强大的堤坝，牢靠地保证了发电的水源。
    在丰满堤坝下游的东侧，有一座和堤坝连成一体的长方形工厂。远远看去，这个工厂像是矮小的一辆电车，静静地躺在高大的堤坝脚下。其实，这个工厂也很大，它长达一百八十九公尺，高二十七公尺多。因为堤坝太大，它就显得很小了。这个工厂，就是丰满发电的地方。
    没来丰满水电站以前，不能理解巨大的电力是怎样发出的。看了以后才明白。原来在堤坝内部埋着一排很大的看不见的水压铁管。这种水压铁管每个重四千多吨，直径有六公尺，长一百多公尺，像倒装的大宝塔似地倾斜地竖在水库和堤坝内。在发电的时候，只花几分钟时间，打开取水门和控制水量的主弁，水就从很高的地方，通过水压铁管，以雷霆万钧之势，冲动水轮机飞快旋转，带动发电机，源源发出电力。然后水又从尾水路，流往下游。水轮机利用一个大轴，带动发电机。这个大轴，有四层楼房那样高，直径约一公尺。它旋转起来，风声四起，轰隆轰隆。
    我们走进发电的厂房，只看见一座庞大铁圈围着的发电机头部，各种各样的手把、仪表和线路。我们听见呼呼声响，知道这里正在发出巨大的电力，送往吉林、长春、沈阳、抚顺、鞍山和哈尔滨等城市去；但是我们没有看见多少工人。只有几个值班员，坐在桌子旁，抄写着什么记录。有时候，他们看看仪表，或者到水轮机近旁走走。在一座漂亮的空气清新的总配电盘室里，几个穿着白衣服的值班员坐在椅子上，沉静地观察着红的绿的白的蓝的灯，掌握和控制全厂发电和送电的运转工作。
    总工程师张文彬告诉我们：“现在我们一个值班员，能够管理两组水轮发电机；伪满时期三个值班员才管理一组水轮发电机。这是我们工厂改建和扩建以后完全自动化的标志。”
    完全自动化——这是丰满水电站改建和扩建工程的主要内容之一。
    1953年，丰满水电站结束堤坝工程的同时，开始了设备的改建和扩建的工作。那时候，安装工人只有六十来人，真正懂得安装电机技术的几乎一个也没有。在安装第一台苏联最新式的自动化水轮发电机的时候，有人认为至少需要八个月；后来在苏联专家帮助下，只有三个月，就安装好了。苏联专家对工人们说：“安装第一台，我们干，你们看；安装第二台，你们干，我们看；安装第三台，你们干，我们看也不再看。”这个要求，提早实现了。第一批安装水力发电设备的中国的技术力量，飞快地壮大起来。原来六十多名不懂安装技术的队伍，已经发展成为两千多人掌握了技术的大军。他们在丰满和全国许多地方，独立地安装了不少水力发电的设备。经过他们的努力，丰满水电站第一个五年计划规定的安装设备工程和改建旧设备为完全自动化的工程，现在已经全部完成。只剩下一台水轮发电机，暂不安装。等到这台水轮发电机安装好了，丰满水电站的发电能力，将达到五十六万七千瓩。
    新设备的安装和旧设备的改建，提高了丰满水电站发电的能力，把丰满水电站推上了完全自动化的道路。苏联最新式的水轮发电机的大小，同伪满时期旧式的水轮发电机一样，但是比旧式的多出一万五千五百千伏安容量。现在的发电能力，比解放初期高两倍多。一系列的发电、变电和送电的自动化的装置，大大减轻了繁重的劳动，同时又好又快又安全地保证发电和送电。在发电的时候，人们坐在屋里开动电钮，不必像过去那样跑到机器旁用手去操纵机器。在伪满时期，出了事故，要想重新恢复送电，至少需要二十分钟。现在安装了一套自动的设备，从起动到恢复送电，只要一分钟。最近丰满水电站还新建了一种名叫线路继电保护装置。有了这种装置，在漫长的高压输电线路发生故障的时候，就会自动地跳闸，制止事故的扩大。如果事故不是永久性的损坏，又会自动地合闸，恢复送电。这种跳闸、合闸所需要的全部时间，只有零点三秒钟。零点三秒钟，是瞬息的变化，几乎没有停电的感觉。过去没有这类自动的装置，线路出了故障，人们紧张万分，急忙恢复送电，至少也需要半小时。现在这些自动化装置，还在改进中。改进的目的，是把一些目前还需要人来劳动的工作，改由机器自己来做。我们知道，苏联有些水电站是关着大门的；生产人员住在很远的地方，来操纵全厂的设备。这个美妙的远景，也是丰满水电站努力的方向。
