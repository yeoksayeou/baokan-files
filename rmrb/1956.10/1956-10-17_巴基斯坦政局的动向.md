The Trends of Pakistan's Political Situation
Liu An

Recently, some new changes have occurred in Pakistan's political situation. In East Pakistan Province, the United Front ended its rule, and a new cabinet headed by Ataur Rahman, the leader of the East Pakistan People's League, took office on September 6. At the same time, the Pakistan Central Government, composed of the Muslim League and the United Front, has also stepped down. On September 12, the People's League and the Republican Party jointly formed a new central government, and the leader of the People's League, Suhrawardy, took office as Prime Minister.

The downfall of the Muslim League and the United Front, which had been in power for a long time, was by no means accidental. It was the result of their policies violating the people's wishes and losing the people's trust. In foreign affairs, the Muslim League and the United Front pursued a policy of strength by following the United States in expanding armaments and preparing for war, and participated in the military groups organized by the United States, which put Pakistan in an isolated position internationally. Domestically, they did not take active measures to solve the people's immediate problems, but instead increased the military budget and infringed on the people's freedom and rights, which brought great disasters to the people and aroused dissatisfaction among the broad masses of the people.

From the evolution of Pakistan's political situation in recent years, we can see the process of the Muslim League and the United Front weakening step by step.

Before 1954, the Muslim League was originally the only ruling party in Pakistan, and it controlled not only the central government but also the local governments. However, in the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly election in March 1954, the Muslim League suffered a crushing defeat, winning only ten seats out of more than 300, thus ending its long-term rule in East Pakistan.

In West Pakistan, the Provincial Legislative Assembly was originally controlled by the Muslim League, which occupied 245 seats out of 306. However, since Sahib Khan, the Chief Minister of the West Pakistan Provincial Government, established the Republican Party on April 23 this year, the Muslim League has undergone serious divisions, and a large number of members have transferred to the Republican Party. On May 20, the election of the Speaker of the Provincial Assembly was held in West Pakistan, and the candidate of the Muslim League also failed. After this, another group of Muslim League members joined the Republican Party, making the Republican Party occupy nearly 200 seats out of more than 300 seats in the Provincial Assembly. The political advantage of the Muslim League in West Pakistan was thus declared over.

The failure of the Muslim League in East and West Pakistan naturally affected its position in the Pakistan Central Government. In the Pakistan parliamentary elections in June 1955, the Muslim League suffered a defeat, winning only thirty-two seats out of eighty. Therefore, the Muslim League had to end its one-party rule and formed a joint government of the Muslim League and the United Front in August 1955, with Muhammad Ali as Prime Minister.

By the end of April this year, twenty-two members of the Muslim League in the Pakistan National Assembly had withdrawn from the League and joined the Republican Party, which was another major blow to the Muslim League. Before the resignation of the Ali Cabinet, the Muslim League's seats in the National Assembly had been reduced from thirty-two to twelve.

The United Front was originally a political party alliance formed in 1954 to participate in the East Pakistan elections. At that time, it announced the "Twenty-One Point Program," advocating the abolition of the landlord system without compensation, guaranteeing civil liberties, developing industry, and opposing participation in military groups. However, after the United Front came to power in East Pakistan, it did not implement this program, but followed the policies of the Muslim League, so it increasingly lost the support of the people. The East Pakistan People's League and the Democratic Party successively withdrew from the United Front and became opposition parties.

In July of this year, the Chief Minister of the East Pakistan government, Sarkar, ordered two ministers to resign, causing twenty-nine members to withdraw from the United Front. This left the United Front with only about 100 seats out of more than 300 seats in the Provincial Assembly, thus losing its majority position. Seeing that it could no longer obtain the trust of the parliament, the United Front was forced to resign on August 30.

The step-by-step weakening of the Muslim League and the United Front is superficially the result of party struggles, but in essence, it reflects the influence of the people's forces in Pakistan. Any political party that violates the will of the people will have no future. This is the clearest conclusion provided by Pakistan's reality.

At present, the new Pakistan Central Government and the East Pakistan Provincial Government have been established, and new policies have been announced.

East Pakistan Chief Minister Rahman has stated that his new cabinet will first solve the food problem, establish a clean government, and ensure the release of all political prisoners and implement the "Twenty-One Point Program." On September 20, the Provincial Legislative Assembly passed a bill to abolish the Public Safety Act, which infringes on civil liberties. At the same time, fifty-nine political prisoners have been released since the Rahman government took office.

The ruling party of West Pakistan, the Republican Party, recently convened a national congress and issued a declaration. The declaration stated that the Republican Party will guarantee national and individual freedom, and guarantee national independence and security. The declaration also promised to hold completely free and fair elections and implement land and industrial reforms, etc. In international relations, the declaration stated that the Republican Party will strive for international peace and maintain close and friendly relations with neighboring countries.

The central government headed by Suhrawardy has announced some new policies. Prime Minister Suhrawardy said in a broadcast on September 12: "Our main program must be to seek the welfare of the masses and improve the living standards of the masses." He also pledged to resolve the food problem as soon as possible, hold free and fair general elections as soon as possible, and resolve major issues such as the land system and the relationship between East and West Pakistan. In foreign policy, the new Pakistani government has expressed its willingness to maintain friendly relations with all countries, especially neighboring countries, and to do its best to maintain peace. Prime Minister Suhrawardy will visit our country soon, which will undoubtedly strengthen the friendly relations between China and Pakistan and benefit peace in Asia. On the Suez Canal issue, the Pakistani government has more clearly changed the erroneous policies of the previous government. When the United States, Britain, and France proposed the establishment of a "Users' Association," Pakistan refused to support it and advocated resolving the issue peacefully through negotiations with Egypt.

These new developments in the Pakistani government have received attention from Pakistani public opinion, which believes that some new policies reflect "the opinions and emotions of the people." They demand that the Pakistani government be able to implement these policies.

The evolution of Pakistan's political situation in recent years shows that the power and influence of the Pakistani people are growing, and at the same time, the development of the entire Asian and world situation is also growing in its impact on Pakistan. The trend of the Pakistani people seeking the correct path to consolidate national independence and improve economic conditions is unstoppable.

    巴基斯坦政局的动向
    刘安
    最近，巴基斯坦的政治局势出现一些新的变动。在东巴基斯坦省，联合阵线结束了它的执政，以东巴基斯坦人民联盟领袖阿陶尔·拉赫曼为首的新内阁于9月6日就职。同时，由穆斯林联盟和联合阵线组成的巴基斯坦中央政府也已经下台，9月12日，人民联盟和共和党联合组成了新的中央政府，人民联盟领袖苏拉瓦底就任总理。
    长期执政的穆斯林联盟和联合阵线的下台，决不是偶然的，这是由于他们所执行的政策违反人民愿望，失掉了人民信任的结果。穆斯林联盟和联合阵线在外交上奉行追随美国扩军备战的实力政策，参加了美国所组织的军事集团，使巴基斯坦在国际上处于孤立地位；在国内，他们也没有采取解决人民切身问题的积极措施，反而增加军事预算，并侵犯人民的自由权利，给人民带来了很大的灾难，引起国内广大人民的不满。
    我们从近些年来巴基斯坦政局的演变中，可以看到穆斯林联盟和联合阵线步步削弱的过程。
    1954年以前，穆斯林联盟本来是巴基斯坦唯一的执政党，它不但控制着中央政府，也控制着地方政府。但在1954年3月东巴基斯坦举行省议会选举时，穆斯林联盟就遭到了惨败，在三百多个议席中只得到十席，从而结束了它在东巴基斯坦长期执政的局面。
    在西巴基斯坦，省立法会议原来也为穆斯林联盟所控制，它在三百零六个议席中，占二百四十五个议席。但是，自从今年4月23日西巴基斯坦省政府首席部长萨希布汗建立共和党以后，穆斯林联盟就发生了严重的分化，大批盟员转入共和党。5月20日西巴基斯坦举行了省议会议长的选举，穆斯林联盟的候选人也失败了。在这以后，又有一批穆斯林联盟议员参加了共和党，使共和党在省议会中的三百多个议席中占据了将近二百个议席。穆斯林联盟在西巴基斯坦的政治优势从此宣告结束。
    穆斯林联盟在东、西巴基斯坦的失败，自然影响到它在巴基斯坦中央政府中的地位。1955年6月，在巴基斯坦议会选举中，穆斯林联盟遭到失败，在八十个议席中只得到三十二个议席。因此穆斯林联盟不得不结束了它的一党执政，于1955年8月成立了穆斯林联盟和联合阵线的联合政府，穆哈默德·阿里任总理。
    到今年4月底，巴基斯坦国民议会中有二十二个穆斯林联盟的议员退出了该盟，加入了共和党，这又是对穆斯林联盟的一次重大打击。在阿里内阁辞职前，穆斯林联盟在国民议会中的议席已从三十二席减为十二席了。
    联合阵线本来是在1954年为了参加东巴基斯坦选举而成立的一个政党联盟。当时它宣布了“二十一点纲领”，主张无偿地废除地主制度，保障公民自由，发展工业，并反对参加军事集团。但是联合阵线在东巴基斯坦上台后却没有执行这个纲领，而是追随穆斯林联盟的政策，所以愈来愈失掉人民的支持。东巴基斯坦人民联盟和民主党相继退出联合阵线成为反对党。
    今年7月，由于东巴基斯坦政府首席部长萨卡尔命令两个部长辞职，引起了二十九个议员退出联合阵线的事件。这使联合阵线在省议会中的三百多个议席中只占一百个左右的议席，从而失去多数地位。由于联合阵线看到它无法再得到议会的信任，在8月30日被迫辞职。
    穆斯林联盟和联合阵线的步步削弱表面上是政党斗争的结果，实质上却反映了巴基斯坦人民力量的影响。任何政党如果违背人民的意志，它就不会有什么前途。这是巴基斯坦现实生活中提供的一个最清楚的结论。
    目前，新的巴基斯坦中央政府和东巴基斯坦省政府都已成立，并且已宣布了新的施政方针。
    东巴基斯坦首席部长拉赫曼已经表示，他的新内阁将首先解决粮食问题，建立廉洁的政府，并且保证释放全部政治犯，执行“二十一点纲领”。9月20日，省立法会议已经通过废除侵犯公民自由的公共安全法的法案。同时，在拉赫曼政府就职后已经释放了五十九名政治犯。
    西巴基斯坦的执政党——共和党，最近召开了全国代表大会，并发表了宣言。这个宣言宣称：共和党将保障全国的和个人的自由，保障国家的独立和安全。宣言并答应举行完全自由和公平的选举，实行土地和工业的改革等等。在国际关系上，宣言声称，共和党将为国际和平而努力，同邻国保持密切的友好关系。
    以苏拉瓦底为首的中央政府宣布了某些新的政策。苏拉瓦底总理在9月12日的广播中说：“我们的主要纲领必须是为人民群众谋福利，提高人民群众的生活水准。”他还保证尽速解决粮食问题，尽早举行自由和光明正大的普选以及解决土地制度和东西巴基斯坦之间的关系等重大问题。在外交政策上，巴基斯坦新政府表示愿意同一切国家特别是邻国保持友好关系，尽力维护和平。苏拉瓦底总理即将来我国访问，这无疑地会加强中国和巴基斯坦的友好关系，并有利于亚洲的和平。在苏伊士运河问题上，巴基斯坦政府已经较明显地改变了前政府的错误政策。在美、英、法三国提出成立“使用国协会”的建议时，巴基斯坦拒绝支持，而主张用和埃及谈判的方法和平解决这个问题。
    巴基斯坦政府的这些新的动向受到巴基斯坦舆论的重视，他们认为某些新的政策反映了“人民的意见和情绪”。他们要求巴基斯坦政府能够实现这些政策。
    几年来巴基斯坦政局的演变表明，巴基斯坦人民的力量和影响正日益增长，同时整个亚洲和世界局势的发展对巴基斯坦的影响也在增长。巴基斯坦人民寻找巩固民族独立和改善经济情况的正确途径的潮流是不可阻遏的。
