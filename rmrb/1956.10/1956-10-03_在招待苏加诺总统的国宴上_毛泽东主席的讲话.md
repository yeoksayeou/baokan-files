    At the State Banquet in Honor of President Sukarno
    Chairman Mao Zedong's Speech
    Your Excellency President, distinguished guests from Indonesia, ladies and gentlemen:
    We warmly welcome President Sukarno, a good friend of the Chinese people, to visit our country. We thank President Sukarno for bringing us the brotherly friendship of the eight thousand and two hundred million people of Indonesia.
    The Indonesian people are a great people. The Chinese people have the utmost respect for the Indonesian people and President Sukarno. Indonesia, which was once ruled by colonialism for three hundred and fifty years, finally won national independence after a long and arduous struggle. Now, the Indonesian people are waging a courageous struggle to safeguard national unity, gradually eliminate the remnants of colonialism, and defend world peace. The outstanding role played by President Sukarno in these struggles, and the great achievements he has recently made during his visits to European and American countries, are praised by the Chinese people and all peace-loving and justice-loving people around the world. Indonesia's abolition of the Round Table Conference agreements and the struggle to recover West Irian are just, and the Chinese people firmly support you.
    Indonesia's pursuit of an active, independent, and autonomous foreign policy is of great benefit to the Indonesian people and to world peace. The Bandung Conference has already had a wide and far-reaching impact, and Indonesia has made significant contributions to the convening of this conference. Indonesia is playing an increasingly important role in international affairs. Our freedom- and independence-loving people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are all opposed to colonialism. On the issue of Egypt's recovery of the Suez Canal Company, our peace-loving people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world must continue to give firm support to Egypt's just struggle. The colonialists hope that we will be disunited, uncooperative, and unfriendly. We must answer them by strengthening unity and strengthening friendly cooperation, and we must thoroughly bankrupt the colonialists' conspiracies!
    The Chinese people and the Indonesian people have always been good friends. In recent years, the friendship between our two peoples in the common cause of opposing colonialism and safeguarding world peace has been further strengthened. I am deeply convinced that the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Indonesia, based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, will be further consolidated and developed in the future.
    I propose a toast,
    To the friendship between China and Indonesia,
    To peace in Asia, Africa and Latin America and the world,
    To the prosperity of the Republic of Indonesia and the well-being of its people,
    To the health of President Sukarno, cheers!

    在招待苏加诺总统的国宴上
    毛泽东主席的讲话总统阁下，印度尼西亚的贵宾们，女士们，先生们：
    我们热烈地欢迎中国人民的好朋友苏加诺总统前来我国访问。我们感谢苏加诺总统给我们带来了八千二百万印度尼西亚人民兄弟般的友谊。
    印度尼西亚人民是伟大的人民。中国人民对印度尼西亚人民和苏加诺总统怀有最大的敬意。曾经被殖民主义统治了三百五十年的印度尼西亚，经过长期艰苦的斗争以后，终于赢得了民族的独立。现在，印度尼西亚人民正在为维护民族团结、逐步肃清殖民主义的残余势力和保卫世界和平而进行着勇敢的斗争。苏加诺总统在这些斗争中所起的卓越作用，和最近在欧美各国访问期间所取得的巨大成就，是中国人民和全世界爱好和平和正义的人民同声赞扬的。印度尼西亚废除圆桌会议协定，和要求收复西伊里安的斗争是正义的，中国人民坚决地支持你们。
    印度尼西亚执行积极的独立自主的外交政策，无论对印度尼西亚人民，对世界和平，都有很大好处。万隆会议已经产生了广泛而深远的影响，印度尼西亚对这次会议的召开曾经作了重大的贡献。印度尼西亚在国际事务上正起着越来越重要的作用。我们亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲爱好自由和独立的人民，都在反对殖民主义。在埃及收回苏伊士运河公司的问题上，我们亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界爱好和平的人民，必须继续对埃及的正义斗争给予坚决的支持。殖民主义者希望我们不团结，不合作，不友好。我们必须用加强团结、加强友好合作来回答它们，我们必须使殖民主义者的阴谋彻底破产。
    中国人民和印度尼西亚人民历来就是很好的朋友。近年来，我们两国人民在反对殖民主义和维护世界和平的共同事业中的友谊，更加加强了。我深信，中国和印度尼西亚两国建立在平等互利和和平共处的原则上的友好合作关系，今后必将更加巩固和日益发展。
    我建议大家举杯，
    为中国和印度尼西亚的友谊，
    为亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界的和平，
    为印度尼西亚共和国的繁荣和人民的幸福，
    为苏加诺总统的健康，干杯！
