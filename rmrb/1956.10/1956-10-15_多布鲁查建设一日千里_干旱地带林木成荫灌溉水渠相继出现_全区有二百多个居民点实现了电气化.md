Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: The Bulgarian Telegraph Agency reports that the Central Statistical Bureau of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers has issued a communique stating that, as of the end of June this year, the Dobruja border region, formerly known for its aridity, has established national protective forest belts on 75,906 decares (one decare equals one and a half mu) of land, while agricultural production cooperatives and state farms have so far established protective forest belts on 79,318 decares of land.

Before liberation, the fields of Dobruja did not receive water for irrigation. Now, three irrigation systems, many pools, ponds, and wells have been built in this border region. Water is now supplied to one hundred and ninety-four settlements throughout the region.

The communique also stated that from the time the resolution was announced until the first half of this year, electrification has been achieved in two hundred and eighteen settlements throughout the region. Prior to this, only five settlements were electrified.

An agricultural science research institute, twenty-seven machine tractor stations, and eleven state farms have been established in Dobruja. By the end of last year, the level of mechanization of field work there had reached 79%.

    多布鲁查建设一日千里
    干旱地带林木成荫灌溉水渠相继出现
    全区有二百多个居民点实现了电气化
    据新华社14日讯　据保加利亚通讯社报道，保加利亚部长会议中央统计局发表公报说，截至今年6月底为止，过去以干旱著称的多布鲁查边疆区已经有七万五千九百零六狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合一市亩半）的土地营造了国家防护林带，而农业生产合作社和国营农场到现在为止，已经在七万九千三百一十八狄卡尔的土地上营造了防护林带。
    解放以前，多布鲁查的田地得不到水的灌溉。现在，这个边疆区已经建造了三个灌溉系统，许多水池、水塘和水井等。全区现在有一百九十四个居民点得到了水的供应。
    公报又说，从决议公布的时候起到今年上半年为止，全区有二百一十八个居民点实现了电气化。在这以前，只有五个居民点电气化。
    多布鲁查已经成立了一个农业科学研究所，二十七个机器拖拉机站和十一个国营农场。到去年底止，那里的田间工作的机械化程度已经达到79％。
