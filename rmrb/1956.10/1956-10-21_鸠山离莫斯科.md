Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th. Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama and his entourage left Moscow by plane for Stockholm at 10:00 a.m. today.

Those who went to the airport to see off the Japanese Prime Minister included Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin and Soviet Foreign Minister Dmitri Shepilov, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Soviet Union and many Soviet and foreign journalists.

Ichiro Hatoyama delivered a speech at the airport before his departure. He said that the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration and the trade development protocol were signed yesterday, so the purpose of my trip has been successfully achieved. Now I am preparing to return home. During my visit to the Soviet Union, I was able to establish direct contact with the Soviet government and also visited the famous historical sites in Moscow. I am very satisfied that the short few days in the Soviet Union have been very meaningful and rewarding. The negotiations on mutual relations between the two countries have been successfully concluded. I hope that the relations between the two countries will develop more friendly and cooperatively in the future.

    鸠山离莫斯科
    新华社莫斯科20日电　日本首相鸠山一郎和随行人员今天上午十时乘飞机离开莫斯科前往斯德哥尔摩。
    前往机场欢送日本首相的有苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫等人，以及各国驻苏联外交使节和苏联与外国的许多记者。
    鸠山一郎临行前在机场上讲话。他说，昨天签订了日苏联合宣言和发展贸易议定书，因此我此行的目的也就圆满达到了。现在我准备回国。在访苏期间，我得以同苏联政府建立直接接触，而且还观光了莫斯科的名胜古迹。在苏联的短短的几天是非常有意义的和有收获的，这一点我感到很满意。关于两国相互关系的谈判已经圆满结束。我希望两国关系今后能在更加友好和合作的气氛中日益发展。
