Xinhua News Agency: The second detachment of the Beijing Medical Team, which is supporting the flood-stricken areas of Hebei, has concluded its medical work in Quzhou County and proceeded to Jize County on October 1st to conduct mobile medical services and treatments.

The Beijing medical team supporting the disaster areas in Hebei consists of seven detachments, and they have been treating disaster victims in the severely affected areas of eleven counties, including Quzhou, Ningjin, and Shenze, since early September. The second detachment treated 5,769 people in eighty-three villages in Quzhou County. After medical treatment, most of the common diseases in the disaster area, such as gastroenteritis, malaria, and colds, have been cured, and some patients suffering from chronic diseases have also improved. In early September, when the medical staff was in Quzhou County, they received a migrant worker, Yuan Wenchang, who suffered from acute appendicitis. In the temporary clinic lacking sterilization equipment, anesthetics, and surgical instruments, the medical staff took emergency measures. Nurses, traditional Chinese medicine doctors, Western medicine doctors, and staff members worked together to chop wood, set up hot pots, sterilize with steam, find anesthetics, prepare gas lamps, and borrow surgical tools. Doctor Shen Erjing, with skilled and accurate movements, found the appendix and performed resection and suturing, removing four calculi from the appendix. All of this took only forty minutes, shortening the originally estimated time by fifty minutes, and everything was normal. Yuan Wenchang's mother talked about the scene during the drought of 1943, saying that no crops or grass seeds were harvested that year, and the tree leaves were all stripped bare. Yuan Wenchang's grandfather, father, younger brother, and younger sister all starved to death; only Yuan Wenchang was left to beg for food. This time, they did not go hungry despite the flood, and the medical team saved her son's life. She insisted on remembering Doctor Shen's name.

Each medical team detachment set up temporary clinics in key areas and also divided into several groups to visit and treat patients in their homes.

According to the person in charge of the Medical and Preventive Department of the Hebei Provincial Health Department, dozens of medical personnel from the second batch of medical teams dispatched from Beijing have been sent to various severely affected areas to replace some of the medical personnel from the first batch.

    北京医疗队在河北灾区进行访问医疗
    新华社讯　支援河北遭受水灾地区的北京医疗队第二中队已结束曲周县的医疗工作，10月1日前往鸡泽县进行访问和治疗。
    北京支援河北灾区的医疗队共有七个中队，他们从9月初开始分别在曲周、宁晋、深泽等十一个县的重灾区为灾民治病。第二中队在曲周县的八十三个村子里为灾民进行了五千七百六十九人次的治疗。经过医疗，一般灾区流行的肠胃炎、疟疾、感冒等疾病绝大部分已经治愈，一些为慢性疾病缠扰的病人也见好转。9月上旬，医务人员在曲周县城时，曾接待了患急性阑尾炎的民工袁文昌，在缺乏消毒设备、麻醉剂和手术器械的临时门诊部，医务人员采取了紧急措施。护士、中医、西医和工作人员一齐动手，劈木材，架火锅，用蒸汽消毒，找麻醉剂，准备汽灯和借用开刀用具。医师沈尔竞以熟练而准确的动作，找到了盲肠，并进行铲除、缝合手术，取出盲肠里的四块类石。这一切仅花了四十分钟的时间，比原来预计的时间缩短了五十分钟，一切正常。袁文昌的母亲谈到1943年旱灾时的情景说，那年庄稼、草籽都不收，树叶都剥光了。袁文昌的爷爷、父亲、弟弟、妹妹都饿死了；只剩下袁文昌在外讨饭。这次大水没挨饿，医疗队又救活了她的儿子，她无论如何也要留下沈大夫的名字。
    各个医疗队中队，一面在重点地区设置临时门诊部，一面分成若干小组到病人家里慰问治疗。
    据河北省卫生厅医疗预防处负责人说，从北京出发的第二批医疗队的几十名医务人员，已分赴各重灾地区接替第一批部分医务人员。
