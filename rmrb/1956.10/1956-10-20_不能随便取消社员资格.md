　　On July 6th and 16th, the Xinqiao Vegetable Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Liuzhou City, Guangxi, issued two announcements, declaring the cancellation of the membership of 111 members. It is said that the reason for canceling the membership of these members was that they were drawn in and induced by rich peasants, the bourgeoisie, and bad elements to go out and work privately, violating labor discipline and hindering production! Why did these members not produce in the cooperative but went out to work? The original story is like this:

　　Xinqiao Cooperative is an advanced cooperative established in February this year. It owns more than 1,000 mu of fertile land with convenient irrigation. The winter melon, taro, tomatoes, cassava and other crops produced are relatively well-known in the suburbs of Liuzhou City. It stands to reason that the production of this cooperative should be very good. However, the fact is not the case. After the establishment of the advanced cooperative, the cooperative cadres did not consider how to lead and improve the cooperative's production, but divided into factions to fight for power and profit. Therefore, the cooperative's production suffered. The tomatoes that could have yielded more than 10,000 jin only yielded more than 1,800 jin; a large number of cabbage, cowpeas, winter melon, and squash also rotted; coupled with the failure to carry out diversified operations well, some ready-made sideline production was not allowed for the members to engage in, so the members' income was much less. The members relied on borrowing two jiao from the cooperative every day to maintain their lives, and often after buying food rations, they had no money to buy oil and salt!

　　Especially in June, after the cooperative suffered a flood, some crops were lost, and some houses were washed away, the members' lives became more and more difficult. The cooperative neither arranged work nor helped the members overcome their difficulties. Some members were on the verge of starvation, so they had no choice but to go out to find work to maintain their lives. Later, the cooperative mobilized the members of the sixth production team, which was the most severely affected by the disaster, to go out to work collectively, but 5% of the income from the work had to be deducted as public welfare funds. The members agreed to this. Who knew that not long after, the cooperative suddenly wanted to deduct another 3% as administrative fees. The members did not agree to this. They said, "Yesterday you said to deduct 5%, today it's 8%. Wouldn't we be working for nothing?" So, they automatically dispersed and went out to find work.

　　Later, more and more members went out to work. Almost all the members of some production teams went out, and the crops in the fields were unattended, seriously affecting summer production. Faced with this situation, the cooperative did not solve the problem by reasonably arranging production and solving the members' living difficulties, but adopted a crude approach: all members who went out and did not return were declared to have their membership cancelled. Less than ten days after the first batch of 59 members were announced to have their membership cancelled, some members returned to production, but the cooperative did not allow them to work. Not only that, the cooperative even adopted measures such as recovering loans and not taking care of the families of members who went out to work. Liang Fanggui's wife worked eight days and earned four yuan and four jiao, but three yuan and seven jiao and four fen were deducted. As a result, some members had to go out to work again. Then, the second batch of 52 members had their membership cancelled!

　　Did the Suburban Committee of the Communist Party of China in Liuzhou know about the cancellation of membership in Xinqiao Cooperative? They knew about it. Zhang Dexiang, the Deputy Secretary of the Suburban Party Committee responsible for leading the vegetable production cooperative, had received a report from Xinqiao Cooperative about canceling the membership of a large number of members. He did not conduct an investigation or correct this erroneous practice, but simply wrote: "Members who go out privately should have their membership cancelled by the cooperative and be held responsible for their family life..."

　　Deputy Secretary Zhang Dexiang of the District Committee, when you see these members who have had their membership cancelled wandering the streets in tears, waiting for temporary work, what do you think?

    不能随便取消社员资格
    ·平·
    7月6日、16日两天，广西柳州市郊区新桥蔬菜生产合作社，先后出了两次布告，宣布取消一百一十一个社员的社员资格。据说，取消这些社员的社员资格的理由是：受了富农资产阶级和坏分子的拉拢、引诱，私自外出做工，违反劳动纪律，妨碍了生产！这些社员为什么不在社里生产，而要外出做工呢？原来是这样一回事：
    新桥社是今年二月成立的一个高级社，它拥有一千多亩土质肥沃、灌溉便利的土地，出产的冬瓜、芋头、蕃茄、木薯等作物，在柳州市郊区来说，也是比较出名的。按说这个社的生产应当是搞得很好的。可是，事实并不是如此。在高级社建立以后，社干部们不是考虑如何领导搞好社的生产，而是分成几派争权夺利。因此，社里的生产也就遭了殃。原来可收一万多斤的蕃茄，只收了一千八百多斤；大批的苞菜、豆角、冬瓜、笋瓜也霉烂了；再加上没有很好开展多种经营，有些现成的副业生产也不让社员去搞，所以社员的收入也就少的多。社员们每天靠向社里借两角钱来维持生活，往往是买了口粮，就再没有钱买油盐了！
    尤其是在六月间，这个社遭受水灾以后，部分作物失收，有些房屋又被冲垮，社员们的生活就愈来愈感到困难。社里既没有安排活路，又没有帮助社员克服生活困难，有些社员眼看就要饿饭，也就不得不出外找工做来维持生活。直到后来，社里才动员受灾最重的第六片社员集体外出做工，但要从做工的收入中抽5％的公益金。社员们也同意这样作。谁知为时不久，社里突然又要再抽3％的行政费。社员们对这不答应，他们说：“昨天说抽5％，今天又是8％，这样我们不白做了吗？”于是，他们就自动分散外出找工了。
    后来，社员外出做工的愈来愈多。有些生产队的社员几乎全部外出，田间作物也无人管理，严重地影响了夏季生产。面对这种情况，社里不是从合理安排生产、解决社员生活困难来解决问题，而是采取了粗暴的作法：对外出未归的社员，一律宣布取消社员资格。就在公布头一批五十九个社员被取消资格后不到十天功夫，有些社员回来生产了，可是社里又不准他们出工。不仅如此，社里甚至还采取追还贷款，对外出社员家属一律不加照顾等手段来对待他们。社员梁芳桂的爱人做了八个工，得四元四角工资，就被扣掉三元七角四分。于是，有些社员只好再次外出做工。接着，第二批五十二个社员又被取消社员资格！
    新桥社取消社员资格的事，中共柳州市郊区委员会不知道吗？他们是知道的。负责领导蔬菜生产合作社的郊区党委副书记张德祥就曾接到过新桥社要取消大批社员资格的报告。他并没有进行调查，纠正这一错误的作法，而是提笔一挥：“私自外出社员，社内应取消其社员资格，并叫他负责其家庭生活。……”
    区委副书记张德祥，当你看到这些被取消社员资格的社员含泪流浪在街头，等待着临时的活路的时候，又作何感想呢？
