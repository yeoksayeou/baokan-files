Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 6th. The construction of the modern Shuangyashan Coal Washery plant building has recently commenced.

　　The coal washery plant building, which will be thirteen stories high upon completion, is being built on a picturesque hillside. Previously overgrown with trees, a vast and flat construction site has now been cleared. Thousands of construction workers are working intensely to build the main plant's base columns and continue construction on the coal bunker, machine repair shop, office building, and other structures that began construction last year and this spring. Several parallel railway sidings laid on the construction site have been connected to railways leading to other locations and mines.

　　The construction of this high-rise plant building is expected to be completed and put into production in 1958. At that time, it will wash and select high-quality coking coal with very low ash content for the steel industry.

　　The Shuangyashan Coal Washery was designed with Soviet assistance, and its main equipment is also provided by the Soviet Union. For every 100 tons of coking coal washed, it can wash out more than fifteen tons of high-quality coal for iron smelting than ordinary coal washeries.

　　This coal washery will also be equipped with excellent dust extraction equipment, so that production workers can work happily in the plant wearing white overalls.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 6th. The Lanzhou Petroleum Machinery Plant's factory area project officially began construction on the 5th, excavating the foundations of the factory buildings.

　　The Lanzhou Petroleum Machinery Plant began preparing for the construction of the factory area in the first quarter of this year. Now, the dedicated railway line and highway directly to the factory area have been built, and a large number of building materials required for construction are being continuously transported to the construction site. Six processing plants, including a precast reinforced concrete structure factory needed for industrialized construction, have all been completed and put into production.

　　The Lanzhou Petroleum Machinery Plant is a highly mechanized factory with a total of fourteen workshops. The installation of some machinery and equipment can begin next year. Once completed, this factory will produce complete sets of new-style petroleum drilling equipment.

　　双鸭山洗煤厂动工兴建
    兰州石油机械厂开挖厂房基础
    新华社哈尔滨6日电　现代化的双鸭山洗煤厂厂房工程在最近动工兴建。
    这座建成以后将有十三层楼高的洗煤厂厂房，是建设在景色幽美的山坡上。过去，这里树木丛生，现在已经开拓出一片广阔平坦的工地。上千个建筑工人正在紧张地建筑主厂房的基柱和继续建设去年和今春动工建设的煤仓、机修厂、办公楼等建筑物。工地上铺设的数条平行的铁路专用线，已经同通往外地和矿井的铁路连接了起来。
    这座高层建筑的厂房工程，预计要到1958年竣工投入生产，那时将为钢铁工业洗选出灰分很低的优等炼焦精煤。
    双鸭山洗煤厂是苏联帮助设计的，其主要设备也是苏联提供的。它每洗一百吨炼焦煤，能比一般洗煤厂多洗出十五吨以上的供炼铁用的精煤。
    这座洗煤厂还将安装很完美的吸尘设备，生产工人可以穿着白色的罩衣在厂里愉快的工作。
    新华社兰州6日电　兰州石油机械厂的厂区工程5日开始正式施工，开挖厂房基础。
    兰州石油机械厂在今年第一季度就开始了厂区的施工准备工作。现在，直通厂区的铁路专用线和公路都已经修好，施工需用的大批的建筑材料正在陆续运到工地。为工厂化施工需要的钢筋混凝土结构预制厂等六个加工厂，已经全部建成投入了生产。
    兰州石油机械厂是高度机械化的工厂，共有十四个车间，明年就可以开始安装部分机器设备。这个工厂建成以后，将生产成套的新式石油钻探设备。
