    Boat Woman of West Lake
    Peng Hui
    Before the snot was dry on my lip, I was already helping my dad steer the boat! I've been rowing alone for over twenty years. As a girl, I worried about my dad not being up to it; as a mother, I always fear the kids will fall overboard! The guests on the boat all say West Lake is beautiful, but I secretly wipe away tears, not knowing where the beauty lies! Now that we're cooperating everywhere, the boat women have become members of the cooperative. The kids are in the nursery, and the eldest son goes to school without costing a penny. The boat feels lighter, and my heart is at ease! When the guests point out the beauty of West Lake, I happily look up, and West Lake is indeed infinitely beautiful!

    彭慧嘴唇上还挂着鼻涕，我就帮着爸爸撑船！放手独自荡桨，算来二十多年。做闺女时当心爸爸不济，做娘时总怕娃娃掉下船！船上客人争说西湖美，我偷着揩干眼泪，不知美在哪边！如今到处搞合作，船娘也成了合作社员。娃娃进了托儿所，大儿子上学不花钱。船也轻，心也闲！客人指点西湖美，我喜得抬头一看，西湖真个美好无边！
