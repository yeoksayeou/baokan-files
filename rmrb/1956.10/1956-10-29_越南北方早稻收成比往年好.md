Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 28th: The early rice harvest in the northern provinces of Vietnam has been completed. According to information from the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, this year's early rice harvest is better than in previous years. Thanh Hoa province averaged 1,000 to 1,100 kilograms per Vietnamese mu (one Vietnamese mu equals five Chinese mu), with individual areas reaching 1,500 kilograms. The early rice harvest in Hoa Binh province was double that of previous years.

During this year's early rice planting season, many areas promoted the early-maturing "Nanning Rice" variety from China. Wherever early rice was planted, there was no shortage of grain during the period between the exhaustion of the old crop and the harvesting of the new. Jian'an province planted 1,000 Vietnamese mu of early rice, which played a significant role in alleviating the disaster-related difficulties of the farmers.

Currently, farmers in various regions are preparing to harvest the autumn rice crop. The autumn rice crop is the main part of Vietnam's autumn harvest, maturing about a month later than early rice, but the sown area is generally more than twice that of early rice.

From many indications, this year's autumn rice harvest is expected to be abundant. The cultivated area for autumn rice in various provinces this year has exceeded the original planned targets. Bac Giang province planted nearly 10,000 Vietnamese mu more, and Hoa Binh, Thai Binh, and other provinces have also exceeded the plan by more than double. Farmers in many areas also implemented warm water soaking of seeds and increased the application of fertilizer. At the same time, farmers in various regions have also carried out a lot of work in resisting natural disasters and flushing the alkalized fields invaded by seawater.

    越南北方早稻收成比往年好
    新华社河内28日电　越南北方各省的早稻已经收割完毕。据从越南农林部得到的消息说：今年的早稻收成比往年好。清化省平均每越亩（一越亩合五市亩）收获一千到一千一百公斤，个别地方达到一千五百公斤。和平省早稻收成比往年多一倍。
    在今年种植早稻的季节里，很多地方推广了中国的早熟的“南宁稻”种。凡是种早稻的地方，都没有出现青黄不接的缺粮现象。建安省由于种植了一千越亩早稻，对解决农民的灾荒起了很大的作用。
    目前，各地农民正在准备收割秋稻。秋稻是越南秋收的主要部分，比早稻晚熟约一个月，但播种面积一般比早稻多两倍以上。
    从很多迹象看来，今年的秋稻可望丰收。今年各省秋稻的耕种面积都超过原计划的指标。北江省多种了近一万越亩，和平、太平等省也都超过计划一倍以上。许多地方的农民还实行了温水浸种，并且增施了肥料。同时，各地农民在抵抗自然灾害和冲洗被海水侵袭而碱化了的田地等方面，也进行了很多工作。
