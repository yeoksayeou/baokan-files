Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 20th - Since the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Shenyang Railway Bureau signed a transportation mutual assistance contract, the average time each vehicle spent within the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's factory in September was shortened by more than nine hours compared to August. This is equivalent to an increase of more than 15,000 wagons that could load over 800,000 tons of cargo in September. In the first half of October, the average vehicle turnaround time was reduced by nearly one and a half hours compared to September.

Prior to August, the transportation situation at Anshan Iron and Steel was very tight, with nearly 10,000 hours wasted daily due to vehicles accumulating within the factory. It wasn't until September this year, after the Anshan Iron and Steel Transportation Department and the Shenyang Railway Bureau signed a mutual assistance contract and adopted various measures, that the transportation bottlenecks began to be alleviated. Now, the Anshan Iron and Steel Transportation Department and the Lingshan Station and Anshan Station of the Railway Bureau can proactively communicate with each other, ensuring timely connection and dispatch of vehicles.

The Anshan Iron and Steel Transportation Department has also signed mutual assistance contracts with various factories, launching a competition with "striving for time" as the slogan. In the past, when vehicles arrived at the factory, loading times were very long, and vehicles were detained for a long time. Sometimes, raw materials could not be supplied in time because the Transportation Department did not allocate vehicles on time, and many finished products accumulated in the factory and could not be shipped out. Now, the Transportation Department allocates vehicles on time, and the factory loads and unloads goods on time.

In order to prepare for winter, on October 19th, the Anshan Iron and Steel Transportation Department and the Shenyang Railway Bureau held a symposium, proposing various measures to improve winter transportation and ensure factory and mine production.

    铁路管理部门和货主签订合同有成效
    缩短了停留时间改善了运输
    新华社鞍山20日电　鞍山钢铁公司和沈阳铁路管理局签订运输互助合同以来，9月份平均每一台车辆在鞍钢厂内停留的时间，比8月份缩短九个多小时。这样，在9月份就相当于增加了可以装载八十多万吨货物的一万五千多辆车皮。10月上半月，平均每辆车停留时间，又比9月份缩短了将近一个半小时。
    鞍钢在8月份以前，运输情况十分紧张，积压在厂内的车辆，一天将近浪费一万个小时。直到今年9月份，鞍钢运输部和沈阳铁路管理局签订互助合同后，采取各种措施，运输堵塞情况才有了改变。现在，鞍钢运输部和铁路局灵山站、鞍山站能互相主动联系，保证车辆及时接入和发出。
    鞍钢运输部与各工厂也订了互助合同，以争取时间为口号开展竞赛。过去当车辆开到工厂时，装货时间很长，车辆停留很久，有时也因为运输部没有按时配车，原料不能及时供应，厂里成品堆积很多运不出去，现在运输部按时配车，厂里按时装卸货品。
    为了做好冬季准备工作，10月19日，鞍钢运输部和沈阳铁路管理局召开座谈会，提出了改善冬季运输、保证厂矿生产等各种措施。
