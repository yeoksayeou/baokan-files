Xinhua News Agency News: Scientists in Beijing have completed a batch of academic works this year. Some of these works have already been published by the Science Press.

Professor Hua Luogeng's "Introduction to Number Theory" is an introductory book on number theory that he has wanted to write for young mathematics workers for more than ten years. In addition to providing a relatively comprehensive introduction to some basic knowledge of number theory, the book also specifically explains the relationship between number theory and other parts of mathematics, and introduces new achievements and research methods in number theory. Mechanic Qian Weichang and young mechanics workers Lin Mingsun, Hu Haichang, and Ye Kaiyuan co-authored the book "Torsion Theory of Elastic Columns". Professor Li Siguang completed the book "Spiral Structures and Other Issues Related to the Composite Problems of the Geotectonic System in Northwestern China." In the preface to this published book, he said that in order to respond to the central government's call to strengthen academic activities, I would like to raise some questions about the geotectonic outline of northwestern China, hoping that it will become a starting point for academic discussions in this area.

In the field of archeology, the first volume of the Chinese Field Archeological Report Collection – "Report on the Excavation of Huixian" – which was compiled by researchers at the Institute of Archeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has been published. Professor Chen Mengjia's "Comprehensive Review of Yin Ruins Oracle Bone Inscriptions" systematically and comprehensively analyzes the literature, grammar, chronology, and calendar of the Yin Dynasty based on historical materials and unearthed cultural relics in recent years, briefly describes the geographical situation of the Yin Dynasty, and discusses the pre-dynastic ancestors, old ministers, official system, religion, and agriculture of the Yin and Shang Dynasties in great detail.

The newly published "Collected Annotations of Guanzi" was originally an unfinished manuscript by Wen Yiduo and Xu Weiyu, which was finally written and proofread by Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The author summarized the achievements in sorting out Guanzi since the Tang Dynasty. The entire book has annotations by the author, along with textual research and judgments. The book begins with a preface written by Guo Moruo.

    北京科学家完成一批学术著作
    新华社讯　在北京的科学家们，今年已经完成了一批学术著作。有的著作已经由科学出版社出版。
    华罗庚教授完成的“数论导引”，是他十多年来一直想为青年数学工作者所写的一部数论入门书。这本书除较全面地介绍了数论上的若干基础知识外，并且具体说明了数论和数学中其他部分的关系，同时介绍了数论研究的新成就及其研究方法。力学家钱伟长和青年力学工作者林鸣荪、胡海昌、叶开沅合著了“弹性柱体的扭转理论”一书。李四光教授完成了“旋卷构造及其它有关中国西北部大地构造体系复合问题”一书，他在这本已出版的书的前言中说，为了响应中央加强学术活动的号召，我愿提出有关我国西北部大地构造轮廓的若干问题，希望能成为在这方面展开学术讨论的一个开端。
    在考古方面，已出版了由中国科学院考古研究所研究人员集体整理的中国田野考古报告集第一号——“辉县发掘报告”。陈梦家教授完成的“殷虚卜辞综述”，根据史料和近年来的出土文物，比较系统和全面地分析了殷代的文学、文法、年代、历法，概略地记述了殷代地理情况，对殷商的先公旧臣以及官制、宗教和农业论述甚详。
    新出版的“管子集校”，原为闻一多、许维遹两人未完成的遗稿，经中国科学院院长郭沫若最后撰校完成。撰者把唐代以来对管子的整理成绩作了总结性的考证。全书都有撰者按语，并加以考证论断。书的篇首有郭沫若撰写的叙录。
