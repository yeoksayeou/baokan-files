    County Newspaper Cadres Urgently Need Help
    Many counties across the country have successively established county newspapers. The cadres who run these newspapers are mostly drawn from various work positions, lacking experience in newspaper management, and urgently need help from all aspects.
    I hope that relevant departments can do the following work well: (1) Provinces should frequently hold short-term training classes to train existing county newspaper cadres in rotation, impart basic professional knowledge. Provincial newspapers should introduce their experience in running newspapers to them, and organize them to visit and intern. Intermediate Party schools can add news classes to specially train Party member cadres of county newspapers. (2) National newspapers and provincial newspapers should frequently publish newspaper reviews, especially strengthening the evaluation of county newspapers, to guide the work of county newspapers. In the past, not enough attention was paid to this aspect. For example, since the beginning of this year, the People's Daily has only published two reviews commenting on the work of county newspapers; the vast majority of the seventy counties in our Jiangsu Province have established county newspapers, but the provincial newspaper has only published two reviews related to county newspapers so far, which is far from meeting our needs. (3) It is hoped that the publishing industry will pay attention to publishing books on news business. There are pitifully few books on this subject currently available in the market. In the Xinhua Bookstore in Shanghai, you can only buy Soviet news business textbooks and some separate editions, but you cannot buy books on this subject published in China, especially works on the history of Chinese newspapers and periodicals and basic knowledge of newspapers. But a book that systematically explains the history of the motherland's newspapers and periodicals, especially the history of newspapers and periodicals led by the Party in the last thirty years, is so needed. Some university journalism departments can also publish their lecture notes. It is also hoped that relevant departments will publish a national news business journal.

    县报干部极需帮助
    全国有许多县都陆续创办了县报。办县报的干部，大多是从各个不同的工作岗位上抽调来的，缺乏办报经验，极需要各方面的帮助。
    我希望有关方面能做好这几项工作：（一）各省经常举办一些短期训练班，轮训现有县报干部，传授一些基本业务知识。省报应向他们介绍办报经验，组织他们参观、实习。中级党校可增设新闻班，专门培养、训练县报的党员干部。（二）全国性报纸、省报要经常发表报纸述评，特别是加强对县报的评介，来指导县报的工作。过去在这方面是注意得不够的。像人民日报今年以来只发过评论县报工作的两篇述评；我们江苏省七十个县绝大部分都办了县报，但省报至今也只发表了两篇有关县报的述评，远远不能满足我们的要求。（三）希望出版界注意出版新闻业务方面的书籍。这方面的书籍目前市上少得可怜，在上海的新华书店里，只能买到苏联的新闻业务教材和一些单行本，却买不到本国出版的这方面的书籍，特别是有关本国报刊史、报纸基础知识的著作。但是一本系统地讲解祖国报刊历史的，特别是近三十年来党所领导的报刊的历史书，是多么需要呵。一些大学新闻系也可以把讲稿拿出来出版。还希望有关部门出一种全国性的新闻业务刊物。　江苏宝山报社　牛禾
