Xinhua News Agency Report by Luo Xuan: Twelve coking coal production bases are under construction in North and Central China. This construction is to meet the needs of the Wuhan and Baotou steel bases.

These bases are distributed in Yitang, Xuangang, Xishan, Fujiatan, and Luan in Shanxi, Shiguai in Inner Mongolia, Pingdingshan in Henan, and the five old mining areas of Fengfeng, Zixing, Pingxiang, Huainan, and Kailuan. To date, forty pairs of mine shafts have started construction on these twelve bases; in addition, four pairs of mine shafts are undergoing pre-construction preparations, ready to commence construction in the fourth quarter of this year or next year.

Other projects on these bases are also being expedited. Of the eight large-scale coal washing plants planned for new construction and renovation during the First Five-Year Plan, one has already commenced construction, and the remaining seven are being designed at an accelerated pace by Soviet, Polish, and domestic coal mine design institutes, striving for full commencement of construction within the next year. Railway spur lines, highways, and power plants, which are being built to accommodate future large-scale construction and production needs, have also largely commenced construction. Near the formerly barren new mining areas of Xuangang, Yitang, and Pingdingshan, thousands of houses have already been built. In order to accelerate the construction of these bases, more than ten old mining areas such as Fushun and Kailuan are also training tens of thousands of technical cadres and workers needed for capital construction and production.

The coal reserves of these bases are not only of excellent quality but also abundant in quantity. Among them, the Fengfeng Coal Mine in Hebei Province, which is already famous for its rich coking coal production, could build five to six new 900,000-ton mine shafts based solely on the currently proven recoverable reserves of prime coking coal, fat coal, and lean coal. Currently, three pairs of new mine shafts have started construction in this mine, and four pairs of existing mine shafts are also being renovated. Once all seven pairs of mine shafts are completed, the coking coal output of this mine will double compared to the present. Not far from Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, geological personnel have discovered large amounts of coking coal not only in the original designated mining area of Pingdingshan but also within the surrounding thousands of square kilometers. Recently, the state has formulated a construction plan for this area. It is estimated that by 1967, the designed capacity of the mine shafts put into production and under construction in this mine will exceed Fushun, currently China's largest coal mining base. Currently, three pairs of modern mine shafts have started construction in this mine, two of which will be able to start production next year.

### 适应武汉、包头钢铁基地的需要  华北华中加紧建设炼焦煤基地

    适应武汉、包头钢铁基地的需要
    华北华中加紧建设炼焦煤基地
    新华社讯　新华社记者罗漩报道：华北和华中地区有十二个生产炼焦煤的基地正在建设着。这是为适应武汉和包头两钢铁基地的需要而建设的。
    这些基地分布在山西的义棠、轩岗、西山、富家滩、潞安，内蒙古的石拐子，河南的平顶山，以及峰峰、资兴、萍乡、淮南和开滦等五个老矿区。到现在为止，这十二个基地上有四十对矿井已经动工兴建；另外有四对矿井正在进行施工以前的准备工作，准备在今年第四季度或明年开工。
    这些基地上的其他工程也都在加紧进行。计划在第一个五年计划期间新建和改建的八个大型洗煤厂，有一个已经动工，其余七个正在委托苏联、波兰和国内各煤矿设计院加速设计，争取在明年内全部开工。为适应将来大规模施工和生产需要而建设的铁路专用线、公路和发电厂等，也都大部分开始施工。在原来一片荒芜的轩岗、义棠和平顶山等新矿区的附近，几千幢房屋已经建设起来。为了加速这些基地的建设，抚顺、开滦等十多个老矿区，还在为他们培养几万个基本建设和生产所需的技术干部和工人。
    这些基地的储煤，不但煤质优良，而且储量丰富。其中如原来就以盛产炼焦煤著名的河北省峰峰煤矿，只就目前已经探明的主焦煤、肥煤和瘦煤的可采储量来看，就能再增建五对到六对九十万吨的新矿井。现在这个矿有三对新矿井已经开始施工，另有四对原有矿井也正在改建。仅这七对矿井全部建成以后，这个矿的炼焦煤产量，就将比现在增加一倍。离开武汉钢铁公司不远的平顶山，地质人员不但在原定的矿区，而且在周围几千平方公里内，也都发现了大量炼焦煤。最近国家已经对这个地区作出了建设规划。预计到1967年，这个矿投入生产和正在建设的矿井设计能力，将超过目前我国最大的煤矿基地抚顺。现在，这个矿有三对现代化的矿井已经动工建设，其中两对在明年就能开始生产。
