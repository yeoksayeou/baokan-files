Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, October 12th: The local light industry and food industry of Heilongjiang Province organized study tours in May and July this year to learn advanced experiences from similar enterprises in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Guangzhou and other places. After promoting these experiences, some enterprises have begun to catch up with the advanced domestic levels.

After learning the experiences of advanced factories across the country, many factories in the food industry system have seen improvements in quality and cost. According to statistics from fourteen factories, cost reductions can increase profits by more than 640,000 yuan throughout the year.

The 410 advanced experiences learned by various enterprises in the light industry system in Shanghai and Tianjin have also been promoted within their own enterprises. Due to the promotion of these advanced experiences, the qualification rate of the main products of the third workshop of Songjiang Pharmaceutical Factory has increased from 55% to over 95%. After Harbin Tannery promoted Shanghai's advanced tanning experience, first-class products also increased from 5% to 40%.

The leading organs of local industries in Heilongjiang Province, in view of the fact that visiting advanced factories is very effective in improving the level of enterprises, also plan to send a sugar industry study tour in the fourth quarter of this year to learn advanced sugar making experience in the People's Republic of Poland and Baotou, Guangzhou and other places.

    学习国内先进经验提高企业水平
    黑龙江地方工业质量成本都有了改进
    新华社哈尔滨12日电　黑龙江省地方轻工业和食品工业，今年5月和7月间先后组织参观学习团，到上海、天津、北京、广州等地学习同类企业的先进经验；推广了这些经验以后，有些企业已经开始赶上国内先进的水平。
    食品工业系统不少工厂在学习了国内各先进厂的经验以后，质量和成本都有好转。据十四个工厂统计，由于成本降低，全年可以增加利润六十四万多元。
    轻工业系统各企业在上海和天津等地学习到的四百一十种先进经验，也已经在本企业中推广。松江制药厂三车间由于推广了这些先进经验，主要产品合格率由55％提高到95％以上。哈尔滨制革厂推广上海的制革先进经验以后，一等品也由5％提高到40％。
    黑龙江省地方工业领导机关鉴于参观访问先进厂的方法对提高企业水平很有效果，今年第四季度还准备派出一个制糖工业参观学习团，分别往波兰人民共和国和包头、广州等地学习制糖先进经验。
