    "Ya Huanglian" Increased Production
    (Our dispatch) News from this newspaper: Huanglian production has increased in Heilin Village, Gaomiao Township, Hongya County, Sichuan Province. The farmers here have a history of planting Huanglian for over a hundred years. They have rich cultivation experience, and the best "Ya Huanglian" is produced here.

    Before liberation, due to the Kuomintang's cruel exploitation, one jin of Huanglian could only be exchanged for two jin of salt. The lives of medicinal herb farmers were unsustainable, and large numbers fled to other areas to escape famine. After liberation, with the support of the Communist Party and the People's Government, Huanglian production rapidly recovered and developed. Currently, one jin of Huanglian can be sold for eight yuan in Renminbi.

    After this township organized a Huanglian production cooperative last year, production has developed even further, with the average net income per household reaching more than 800 yuan. As the members' lives have become wealthier, their enthusiasm for production has also increased. This year's attendance rate is 44.1% higher than last year. This year, the Huanglian planting area has increased more than twofold compared to before liberation. It is estimated that in the next four years, the average income per household member will be more than 4,800 yuan (Huanglian is harvested five years after planting).

    “雅连”增产
    本报讯　四川洪雅县高庙乡黑林村黄连增产了。这里的农民有一百多年栽种黄连的历史，他们有丰富的栽培经验，中国最好的“雅连”就出产在这里。
    解放前，由于国民党的残酷剥削，一斤黄连只能换二斤盐巴；药农生活无法维持，大批向外逃荒。解放后，在共产党和人民政府的扶持下，黄连生产迅速地恢复和发展起来了，目前每斤黄连已能卖到人民币八元。
    这个乡去年组织了黄连生产合作社以后，生产有了更大的发展，平均每户纯收入达到八百多元。社员们生活富裕了，生产积极性也就更高了，今年出勤率比去年提高44.1％。今年黄连栽种面积比解放前增加二倍以上，估计今后四年内每户社员平均可收入四千八百多元（黄连下种五年后收获）。
