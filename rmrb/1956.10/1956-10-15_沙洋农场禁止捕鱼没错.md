    Shayang Farm's Prohibition of Fishing is Correct

    Regarding the criticism raised by reader Liu Shiquan in your newspaper on August 2, 1956, concerning the No. 8 branch of the state-owned Shayang Farm prohibiting the masses from fishing in Zhoujia Lake, the main reason given was that agricultural cooperatives should not be prevented from fishing in desolate lakes. However, Zhoujia Lake is not a desolate and ownerless lake. This lake was originally desolate, but the Shayang Aquatic Products Company built a dike in March 1955 and used it for fish farming. Later, due to cost issues, it was temporarily handed over to the No. 8 branch for management. After accepting the lake, the branch purchased more than 50,000 silver carp from the Aquatic Products Company on November 18, as well as bighead carp, grass carp, etc., which were raised to about three inches in size and released into the lake in the spring of 1956.

    The agricultural cooperative in Xingfu Township (there are no fishing cooperatives or professional fishermen around the two lakes) also fished in Zhu Lake. This lake is also a fish farming lake of the No. 8 branch, and its dike was built by the No. 8 branch to solve farmland water conservancy and fish farming problems, and fish fry were released in September 1955.

    We personally assisted in the fish stocking work in these two lakes, so we can fully prove that these lakes are not desolate and ownerless lakes, but fish farming lakes of the farm.

    The Ministry of Commerce's "Several Issues That Urgently Need to Be Resolved in Marine and Freshwater Aquaculture" on March 19, 1956, stipulated that small and medium-sized lakes and water surfaces that the state has invested in and operated in the past should continue to be operated by the state; lakes, swamps, and reservoirs within the land area operated by state-owned farms and reform-through-labor farms may be operated by the farms. Zhoujia Lake and Zhu Lake are already operated by the No. 8 branch and are lakes that can be operated. The members of nearby agricultural cooperatives know that these lakes have been stocked with fish, and there are red flags indicating the prohibition of fishing in the lakes, so it is illegal for them to fish in the fish farming lakes of the No. 8 branch.

    沙洋农场禁止捕鱼没错
    你报1956年8月2日所载读者刘士泉对国营沙洋农场第八分场禁止群众在周家湖捕鱼一事提出批评，其主要理由是农业社在荒湖中捕鱼是不能阻止的。但周家湖并非无主荒湖。这个湖原来是荒湖，沙洋水产公司在1955年3月修建了湖堤，利用它来养鱼，后因造价问题暂交八分场经营。该场接受此湖后，11月18日向水产公司购得白鲢五万多尾、以及花鲢、草鱼等培育成三寸左右，在1956年春投入湖中。
    幸福乡的农业社（两湖周围无渔业社和专业渔民），在朱?湖也打过鱼。这个湖也是八分场的养鱼湖，其湖堤是八分场为了解决农田水利和养鱼而修的，并在1955年9月投放了鱼种。
    这两个湖的鱼种投放工作，我们曾亲自协助进行，因此完全可以证明这些湖并非无主荒湖，而是农场的养鱼湖。
    1956年3月19日商业部“关于海、淡水养殖中急需解决的若干问题”中规定：国家过去已投资经营的中小型湖泊水面，仍应由国家继续经营；在国营农场、劳改农场所经营土地范围内的湖泊、沼泽、水库，可由农场经营。周家湖、朱?湖已经由八分场经营而且是可以经营的湖泊。附近农业社的社员，知道这些湖是已经放了鱼的，湖中并插有表示禁湖的红旗，因此他们在八分场养鱼湖中捕鱼是非法的。
