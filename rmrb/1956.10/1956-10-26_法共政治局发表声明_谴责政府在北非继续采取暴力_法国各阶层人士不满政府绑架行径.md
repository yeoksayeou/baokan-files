Xinhua News Agency, October 25th: According to TASS, Paris, October 24th: "L'Humanité" published a statement by the Politburo of the French Communist Party on the Algerian question and the arrest of the leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front. The statement said that the vast majority of French people hope for a peaceful resolution to the Algerian question, but the government's arbitrary actions confirm its intention to continue to implement a destructive policy of strength in North Africa.

The statement pointed out that the arrest of the leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front carries serious consequences, as it will threaten the friendly relations between France and Tunisia and Morocco.

The Politburo's statement emphasized that it is urgently necessary to resolve the Algerian question through negotiations with representatives of the people of that country. The French Communist Party Politburo called on working people, democrats, and all French people who care about the interests and honor of France to unite and jointly demand negotiations in Algeria.

Xinhua News Agency, October 25th: According to TASS, Paris, October 24th: People from all walks of life in France are deeply dissatisfied with the French government's kidnapping of Algerian national leaders. Senior government officials also have disagreements over this matter.

The French "Republican Union for Progress" issued a special statement condemning this action by France, pointing out that this action reduces the possibility of resolving the Algerian question through consultation. The "Franco-Muslim Catholic Committee," the "Overseas Territories Justice and Freedom Movement," the "Committee for a Peaceful Solution to the North African Question," and many other organizations have also protested.

    政治局的声明着重指出，通过同这个国家人民的代表举行谈判来解决阿尔及利亚问题是迫切需要的。法国共产党政治局号召劳动人民、民主人士以及关心法国的利益和荣誉的一切法国人联合起来，共同要求在阿尔及利亚进行谈判。
