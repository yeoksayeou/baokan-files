    Squirrel
    Guan Hua
    In a cage, a squirrel runs wildly, treading on a wheel. Sweat soaks through his grey fur coat. The wheel wears down his feet. His friend calls from outside: Brother, why not run outside? Outside there are forests full of pine cones, clear streams, and beautiful flowers and grasses. The squirrel, while treading the wheel to make it spin, gasps for breath, and wipes his sweat with a triumphant look, I am busy, busy. I am so busy that my hands and feet have no time to rest, how can I have time to go out? Brother, you are busy day and night, your feet never stop running. You are so tired you are skin and bones, bones connected to ribs, but you have not moved forward one step!

    松鼠
    管桦在一个笼子里，松鼠脚踩着轮子飞跑。汗水湿透他的灰毛皮袄。轮子磨破他的双脚。他的朋友在外面叫道：老兄，为何不到外面跑跑？外面有结满松子的森林，清清的流水，美丽的花草。松鼠一面踩的轮子飞转，一面呼呼气喘，一面得意地擦着汗，我忙啊，忙啊。忙得我手脚不得闲，那有出外的时间？老兄啊，你日夜地忙碌，两脚不停地飞奔。累得你皮包骨，骨连肋，可是你一步也没有前进！
