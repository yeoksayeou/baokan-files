    Guangzhou Cement Plant's Output Completes Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule

    (Our dispatch) The Guangzhou Cement Plant completed the output target stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan fifteen months and thirteen days ahead of schedule. As of September 17th, the total cement output has reached the 1957 level, an increase of 132.35% compared with the total cement output in 1952. In the three years and more from 1953 to August 1956, in addition to fulfilling the state production plan, the plant's employees also produced an extra 89,029 metric tons of cement for the country.

    The Guangzhou Cement Plant has continuously improved production by strengthening research and experimentation in new technologies and by constantly paying attention to summarizing and promoting advanced experiences. For example, the sintering workshop further promoted advanced Soviet experiences such as "water cooling" of cement kilns and fluxing agents; in operation, they strengthened close cooperation between the three shifts, diligently monitored the fire, appropriately mixed coal materials, and improved the method of hanging chains.

    广州水泥厂的产量提前完成五年计划
    本报讯　广州水泥厂，提前十五个月又十三天，完成第一个五年计划所规定的产量指标。截至9月17日止，水泥总产量已达到了1957年的水平，比1952年的水泥总产量提高了132.35％。从1953年到1956年8月的三年多中，全厂职工除完成国家生产计划外，还为国家多生产了水泥八万九千零二十九公吨。
    广州水泥厂由于加强了对新技术的研究和试验工作，经常注意总结和推广先进经验；因此使生产不断提高。如烧成车间，进一步推广了水泥窑“水冷却”和助溶剂等苏联先进经验；在操作上加强了三班紧密配合，勤看火，适当配合煤料，改善链条的挂法等。　（吴茂盛）
