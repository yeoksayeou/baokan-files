Great Writer, Great Warrior

    Today is the twentieth anniversary of the death of Lu Xun, our country's great people's writer and great revolutionary fighter. The broad masses of people commemorate Lu Xun with excitement, commemorating his noble character and immortal achievements.
    Lu Xun's activities were mainly in the field of literature. Lu Xun, together with many contemporary writers with the same direction, opened up a new period in Chinese literature. Lu Xun was born in an era of drastic changes in Chinese history. He was a loyal son of the times and the people. From the first day he began his literary life, Lu Xun consciously regarded literature as a powerful weapon to awaken the people and promote social progress. Lu Xun thoroughly reformed the Chinese novel. In his works, he unfolded a true picture of the daily lives of people breathing, groaning, and struggling in the darkness. The images of these helpless oppressed deeply shocked the reader's social conscience, making the reader fight for their future. Because of their great social significance and high artistic power, these works helped China's new people's literature quickly gain the right to exist, and established the foundation of the realist tradition in China's new literature in the past forty years. Relying on the efforts of Lu Xun and other people's writers, the role of literature in China's social life has been greatly enhanced. It is no longer, as many people imagined in the past, a tool for individuals to relieve sorrow and boredom and a dispensable decoration; its becoming a powerful weapon to awaken the people and promote social progress, and its special performance and special value as such a weapon, are already beyond dispute.
    However, Lu Xun's activities were far from limited to literary creation. Lu Xun fought with his literary creation, and also fought with all other means he could take. He created a new style of social criticism and cultural criticism essays. In his large number of essays, he commented on current political, social, ethical, scientific, cultural, and artistic issues, and carried out a sharp and merciless struggle against the enemies of the people and for the development of the people's culture. Lu Xun's later essays showed a firm and mature revolutionary world view, and made outstanding contributions to the people's revolutionary cause at that time. These essays, like his novels, prose poems, and memoirs, are a valuable legacy he left to Chinese literature. In addition, he also carried out a lot of translation work and scientific work related to the history of Chinese literature. He was always the most enthusiastic teacher and friend of young literary and art workers. In his life, he not only participated in the revolutionary struggle with his pen, but also directly participated in many social and cultural activities that supported the revolutionary struggle. He was a great comrade of the Chinese Communist Party.
    Lu Xun's life is a model of the combination of dauntless revolutionary spirit and rigorous and realistic spirit. For the motherland, for the people, and for the people's culture, he gave everything. He never yielded in the face of enemies and difficulties, and he never put on airs, put on a stinking face, or glossed over his mistakes and shortcomings in front of the people. In every one of his works, you can not only see with your eyes, but also feel the beating of his heart with your own heart. He strictly demanded himself, and on issues of principle, he also strictly demanded his comrades. He said what he knew, didn't pretend to understand what he didn't understand, and didn't pretend to believe what he didn't believe. He loved his motherland and people, and loved the excellent things in the motherland's culture, but did not therefore become a nationalist bigot; on the contrary, precisely because he was a true patriot, he became the most resolute exposer of this kind of bigotry. He was a Marxist in his later years, but did not therefore say that the mistakes of Marxists were also correct, and that the correctness of non-Marxists was also wrong; on the contrary, precisely because he was a true Marxist, he adhered to the attitude of seeking truth from facts, and seriously opposed exaggeration, arbitrariness, and sectarian habits.
    The reactionary rule in China that Lu Xun hated has been overthrown, and the socialist society that Lu Xun pursued has been established in China. Therefore, our current struggle tasks and struggle methods are different from those in Lu Xun's time. However, Lu Xun's ideals for the people's cultural cause and new social ethics have not yet been fully realized. The people who are building a new life not only urgently need Lu Xun-style art, but also urgently need Lu Xun-style workers to serve them with Lu Xun-style enthusiasm and tenacity. Let us most widely disseminate Lu Xun's ideological legacy, let our literary and art front and all those who serve the people be armed with Lu Xun's fighting spirit, and let our youth be educated by Lu Xun's works—this is our best commemoration of this great writer and great warrior.

    伟大的作家，伟大的战士
    今天是我国伟大的人民作家和伟大的革命战士鲁迅逝世的二十周年纪念日。广大的人民怀着激动的心情纪念鲁迅，纪念他的崇高的人格和不朽的业绩。
    鲁迅的活动主要是在文学方面。鲁迅同他的许多同时代同方向的作家在一起，开辟了我国文学的新时期。鲁迅生在我国历史的激烈的变革时代。他是时代和人民的忠实的儿子。鲁迅从他开始文学生活的第一天起，就自觉地把文学作为唤起人民觉悟、推动社会进步的强有力的武器。鲁迅彻底地革新了中国的小说。他在自己的作品中展开了在黑暗中呼吸着、呻吟着、挣扎着的人民的日常生活的真实图画，这些无告的被压迫者的形象深深地震动着读者的社会良心，使读者不能不为他们的未来而斗争。这些作品由于具有巨大的社会意义和高度的艺术力量，帮助我国的新的人民文学迅速地取得了生存权，并且确立了近四十年来我国新文学中的现实主义传统的基础。依靠鲁迅和其他人民作家的努力，文学在我国社会生活中的作用大大地提高了。它不再像过去许多人所想像的那样，是个人消愁遣闷的工具和可有可无的装饰品；它的成为唤起人民觉悟、推动社会进步的强有力的武器之一，它的作为这种武器的特殊性能和特殊价值，已经是不需要争辩的了。
    但是鲁迅的活动远不以文学创作为限。鲁迅用他的文学创作战斗，也用其他一切他所能采取的方式战斗。他创造了社会批评和文化批评的论文的新式体裁，在他的大量的论文里，他评论着当前的政治、社会、伦理、科学、文化、艺术各方面的问题，为反对人民的敌人和发展人民的文化进行了辛辣无情的斗争。鲁迅后期的论文里表现了坚定的和成熟的革命世界观，对于当时的人民革命事业作了杰出的贡献。这些论文跟他的小说、散文诗、回忆同样是他留给中国文学的宝贵遗产。此外，他还进行了很多翻译工作和有关中国文学史的科学工作。他始终是青年文艺工作者的最热心的教师和朋友。在他的一生中，他不但用笔参加革命斗争，而且也直接参加了许多支持革命斗争的社会活动和文化活动。他是中国共产党的伟大的同伴。
    鲁迅的一生是大无畏的革命精神跟严谨的实事求是精神相结合的典范。为了祖国，为了人民，为了人民的文化，他献出了一切。他从不在敌人和困难面前屈服，也从不在人民面前打官腔，摆臭架子，粉饰自己的错误和缺点。在他的每一篇作品里，你不但可以用眼睛看到，而且可以用自己的心感觉到他的心的跳动。他严格地要求自己，而在原则的问题上，他也严格地要求他的同志。他说他所知道的东西，不懂的不装做懂，不相信的也不装做相信。他热爱自己的祖国和人民，热爱祖国文化中优秀的东西，但是并不因此而成为民族的自大狂；相反，正因为他是真实的爱国者，他成了这种自大狂的最坚决的揭发者。他在晚年是马克思主义者，但是并不因此而把马克思主义者的错误也说成是正确的，把非马克思主义者的正确也说成是错误的；相反，正因为他是真实的马克思主义者，他坚持实事求是的分析态度，而严肃地反对浮夸、武断和宗派习气。
    鲁迅所痛恨的中国的反动统治已经被推翻了，鲁迅所追求的社会主义社会已经在中国建立起来了。因此，我们今天的斗争任务和斗争方式，跟鲁迅在世的时候已经有了不同。但是鲁迅对于人民文化事业和新的社会伦理的理想，还远没有完全实现。建设着新生活的人民，不但迫切地需要鲁迅式的艺术，而且迫切地需要鲁迅式的工作人员用鲁迅式的热情和顽强性为他们服务。让我们最广泛地传播鲁迅的思想遗产，让我们的文艺战线和一切为人民服务的人们都用鲁迅的斗争精神武装起来，让我们的青年都受到鲁迅的作品的教养——这就是我们对于这位伟大的作家和伟大的战士的最好的纪念。
