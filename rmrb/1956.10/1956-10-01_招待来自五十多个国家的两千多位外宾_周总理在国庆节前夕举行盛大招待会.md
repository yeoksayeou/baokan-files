Xinhua News Agency, 30th - Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, held a grand reception this evening to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the National Day, hosting over two thousand foreign guests from more than fifty countries across the five continents.

When President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia, who is currently visiting China, and Prime Minister Tanka Prasad Acharya of the Kingdom of Nepal appeared on the platform in the banquet hall alongside Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling, the entire venue erupted in thunderous and enthusiastic applause to welcome them.

Chairman Mao Zedong warmly welcomed the foreign guests from various countries at the reception. He said:

Friends, Comrades:

Welcome to our country, welcome to participate in our country's National Day. I wish all friends and comrades good health.

President Sukarno was invited to speak at the reception. He said: Dear brothers, I am very happy to be able to participate in the National Day of the People's Republic of China today, and I would like to extend my congratulations to the Chinese people.

The victory of the People's Republic of China is felt by the Indonesian people as their own victory. Indonesia and the People's Republic of China are two close friends. I hope that China and Indonesia can move forward side by side and cooperate to achieve prosperity for both countries and world peace.

Prime Minister Acharya of the Kingdom of Nepal then spoke at the invitation of the host. He said:

I am very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in tonight's gathering. Nepal and China are neighboring countries, and the two countries recently concluded an agreement based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Since arriving in China, I have personally witnessed the Chinese people working to build their country, which has left a deep impression on me.

I believe that all Asian countries should build their own countries and move forward hand in hand. All Asian countries and all countries in the world should unite and live peacefully together. I once again thank the Chinese people for their welcome.

All the Chinese and foreign guests welcomed their speeches with warm applause and together raised their glasses to celebrate this festival of the Chinese people.

At the beginning of the reception, Premier Zhou Enlai, amidst enthusiastic applause, delivered a welcome speech to all foreign guests from various countries. He said: Dear friends, comrades:

The seventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is approaching. We are very honored that His Excellency President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia and His Excellency Prime Minister Acharya of the Kingdom of Nepal can be with us on this joyous festival of the Chinese people. This year, celebrating our National Day with us are also delegations from fraternal parties from various countries attending the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, as well as official and non-governmental delegations and well-known figures from many countries, representing various fields such as parliament, military, science, culture, art, economy, trade, religion, news, sports, trade unions, youth, women, and peace. I now represent the Chinese government and the Chinese people in extending the warmest welcome to the distinguished guests and friends from various countries.

In order to carry out socialist construction domestically, the Chinese people need a peaceful international environment and need more friends in the world. The precious friendship of the people of all countries towards the Chinese people has always been valued by us. Continuously enhancing this friendship has been, is, and always will be an important task of ours. Today, we are able to gather together with so many international friends, vividly demonstrating that the Chinese people have friends all over the world.

The achievements made by the Chinese people in domestic construction and international affairs over the past seven years are inseparable from the friendship, sympathy, and support given to us by the people of all countries in the world. We have no reason to be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. We should conscientiously correct the shortcomings in our work and continue to learn humbly from the people of all countries in the world. Only in this way can we guarantee that we will achieve more and greater achievements in our future work. We sincerely ask friends from all countries to offer suggestions for improving our work, especially to offer strict criticism of any great-power chauvinism tendencies and complacency. We will regard such opinions and criticisms as the most friendly expression towards the Chinese people.

Mutual contact between leaders of various countries and friendly exchanges between people of various countries have become a characteristic of current international relations and have greatly promoted the cause of world peace. In these areas, the Chinese people have contributed their share of strength, and will continue to contribute their strength in the future. Let us wish in advance that by this time next year, we will be able to receive friends from more countries!

Finally, I propose:

To the health of the distinguished guests and friends from various countries,
To the health of the diplomatic envoys of various countries stationed in China,
To the peaceful coexistence and friendly exchanges of various countries,
To lasting world peace,
Cheers!

After Premier Zhou Enlai's speech, he went to the venue to toast peace and friendship with Prime Minister Acharya of Nepal and his wife, senior Indonesian officials accompanying President Sukarno on his visit to China, senior officials accompanying the Prime Minister of Nepal, representatives of fraternal parties from more than fifty countries attending the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China, personnel from parliamentary, military, judicial, agricultural, and trade delegations from various countries, well-known peace activists and public leaders from various countries, as well as delegations and representatives from various fields such as science, culture, art, economy, commerce, religion, news, sports, trade unions, youth, women, and peace.
