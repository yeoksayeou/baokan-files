Xinhua News Agency, October 21st: Beijing is strengthening the transformation of the private transport horse-drawn carriage industry. The principle of the transformation is based on facilitating cargo owners, convenient transportation, and not disrupting existing business relationships.

There are more than 4,000 private transport horse-drawn carriages in Beijing, of which more than 2,000 are scattered carriages, living scattered in the suburbs, making it difficult to manage and leading to chaotic freight rates and wasted transport capacity. In order to rectify this transportation and meet the vehicle owners' requirements for organization, the Beijing Municipal Transportation Administration has begun to help these scattered carriage owners organize transportation cooperative groups. Carts and horses remain the private property of the owners, who earn their own living. Each group appropriately draws some public accumulation based on its business and the economic situation of its members, as working capital for members' vehicle repairs and labor insurance welfare funds or office expenses. At present, scattered carriage owners in three districts have formed 20 transportation cooperative groups, and other districts are also organizing.

Various organizational methods have been adopted when organizing transportation cooperative groups. For example, in areas where vehicles are relatively concentrated and vehicle owners live in concentrated areas, the method of "organizing on the spot" is adopted to maintain the original regional business relationships and facilitate vehicle owners. These cooperative groups, except for the transportation of basic construction materials, which is uniformly undertaken and allocated by the Municipal Transportation Company, handle sporadic businesses themselves. Some horse-drawn carriage owners who regularly transport for one or several construction sites or enterprises are grouped according to their original service units to ensure that the business is uninterrupted and the transportation does not stop. For some small horse-drawn carriages that are scattered and mobile, have no fixed parking place, and have very sporadic business, the method of "braiding" is adopted. They are grouped according to their place of residence, and the business is still undertaken by the vehicle owners themselves, and the freight rates are not uniformly stipulated for the time being, in order to maintain their characteristics of being available on call and decentralized activities.

In addition, there are more than 2,000 private transport horse-drawn carriages in the city, which had already formed more than 20 private horse-drawn carriage transport groups a few years ago. This time, according to the requirements of these vehicle owners, the preparatory office of the horse-drawn carriage transport cooperative has been helped to organize in September, to prepare conditions for the formal establishment of a low-level cooperative with vehicles and horses discounted as shares.

Beijing now also has more than 2,000 transport horse-drawn carriages from other places, and it is planned to mobilize them to return to the agricultural cooperatives or transport cooperatives they originally joined to work.

### 根据方便货主便利运输的原则  北京加强对私人运输车马业改造

    根据方便货主便利运输的原则
    北京加强对私人运输车马业改造
    新华社21日讯　北京市加强对私人运输马车业改造。改造原则是根据方便货主、便利运输和不打乱原有业务关系进行的。
    北京市私人运输马车有四千多辆，其中两千多辆是零散马车，散居城郊各地，很难管理，形成运价混乱、运力浪费。为了整顿这些运输和满足车户组织起来的要求，北京市运输管理局已开始帮助这些零散马车户组织运输合作小组。车马归车户私有，自劳自得。各组根据业务和成员的经济情况，适当抽些公共积累，作为成员修车周转金和劳保福利金或办公费用。现在，已有三个区的零散马车组成了二十个运输合作小组，其他区也正在组织中。
    在组织运输合作小组时，采取了各种不同的组织方法。如车辆比较集中和车户居住集中的地区，采取“就地组织”的方法，以维持原有地区的业务关系和便利车户。这些合作小组，除基本建设材料运输业务由市运输公司统一承办调拨外，零星业务由小组自行承运。经常为一个或几个建筑工地或企业运输的一些马车户，按原服务单位进行编组，以保证业务不间断，运输不停顿。对一些分散流动、没有固定停车地点、业务也很零星的小型马车，采取“编辫子”的办法，按住地编组，业务仍由车户自行承运，运价也暂不统一规定，以保持它们随叫随到、分散活动的特点。
    此外，全市还有两千多辆私人运输马车，它们在几年前就已组成二十多个私人马车运输组。这次根据这些车户的要求，已在9月间帮助他们组织了马车运输合作社筹备处，为正式成立车马折价入股的低级合作社准备条件。
    北京市现在还有外地流入的两千多辆运输马车，准备动员他们回到原来加入的农业合作社或运输合作社去工作。
