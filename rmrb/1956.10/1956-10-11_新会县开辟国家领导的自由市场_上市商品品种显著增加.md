Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 9th: In the past two months, Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, has changed its market management methods for small-scale agricultural and sideline products. After organizing free markets led by the state, the variety of listed goods has significantly increased. In some industries in towns such as Gujing, Waihai, and Huicheng, commodities such as salted groceries, pottery and mountain goods, and medicinal materials have been added in many varieties, including the famous salted fish that had been out of stock for more than a year. Various beans, cigarette paper, lotus seeds, osmanthus powder, etc., which had been out of stock for a long time but were in great demand by the masses, have also been put on the market.

After the state-led free market adopted the principles of pricing according to quality, free purchase, and free transportation, the quality of local products such as green vegetables, vermicelli, pancakes, and some bamboo handicraft products improved. Many locally produced, locally processed, and locally sold commodities have reduced their sales prices due to the reduction of circulation links. The prices of non-staple foods in the Fourth District have generally decreased by 5% to 8%. The sales prices of non-staple foods such as duck and fermented bean curd in Gujing Town have decreased by 5% to 13%.

The opening of the state-led free market has also promoted state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives to improve their business management and operating style. In the past, the prices of some local commodities were unreasonable and not easily discovered. Now, because they are purchasing goods from other places and implementing free purchase, unreasonable prices are easily exposed, thus enabling state-owned and cooperative commercial units throughout the county to adjust the prices of 180 kinds of commodities. In order to encourage small vendors to purchase more goods from their own units, many state-owned stores and supply and marketing cooperatives have paid more attention to the storage and display of goods, promptly taken stock of warehouses, replenished goods, and rationally handled deteriorated goods. As a result, the capital turnover rate of non-staple foods in the Fourth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative increased from 0.76 times in July to 0.83 times in August. Some units also send people to contact agricultural cooperatives every day to understand the needs of consumers.

After the market management methods were changed, small vendors actively used their old relationships to organize sources of goods and increase the variety of commodities, and their turnover and income generally increased. The total turnover of small vendors in the Third and Eighth Districts in August increased by 50% to 100% compared with June. In the Third District, two-thirds of the small vendors' turnover could not reach the starting point for business tax in the past, but now two-thirds of the small vendors have reached it; the number of small vendors with difficulties in the whole district has been reduced from the original 28 households to 8 households.

After the opening of the free market, although the prices of some breeds of poultry seedlings, which were in short supply, had risen somewhat, a few agricultural cooperatives were unwilling to fulfill the original sales contracts for important bulk agricultural products because they found that prices were higher in neighboring areas, and a few agricultural cooperative members wanted to change from farming to business, it was more difficult for state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives to control purchasing and marketing plans than in the past, but these are not the massive and main situations after the opening of the free market. The local financial and economic departments are currently taking or preparing to take many measures to solve these problems, such as controlling the main sources of goods, strengthening the price management of the market, organizing trading markets for agricultural and sideline products, modifying purchasing and marketing plans according to the direction of commodity circulation, strengthening guidance on agricultural and sideline production, paying attention to educating farmers, small vendors and personnel in joint state-private enterprises, and strengthening the connection between state-owned commercial units, etc.

### 新会县开辟国家领导的自由市场  上市商品品种显著增加

    新会县开辟国家领导的自由市场
    上市商品品种显著增加
    新华社广州9日电　广东省新会县最近两个月来，改变了对小宗农业副产品的市场管理办法，组织了由国家领导的自由市场后，上市的商品品种显著增加。如古井、外海、会城等墟镇的一部分行业，就增加了咸杂、陶瓷山货、药材等商品多种，其中包括脱销了一年多的著名咸鱼。过去绝市多时但为群众大量需要的各种豆子、烟纸、莲子、桂花粉等，也有上市。
    国家领导的自由市场，采取按质论价、自由选购、自由贩运后，使当地出产的青菜、粉条、面饼以及一部分竹器手工业品的质量提高了。许多当地生产、当地加工、当地销售的商品，因为减少了流转环节而降低了销售价格。第四区副食品的价格普遍下降5％到8％。古井镇的鸭、豆腐乳等副食品的销售价格下降5％到13％。
    国家领导的自由市场开放后，还推动国营商业和供销合作社改进了经营管理和经营作风。当地有些商品的价格过去不合理也不易被发现，现在因为向外地进货并且实行自由选购，价格不合理便容易暴露出来，因而使全县的国营和合作社商业单位将一百八十种商品的价格作了调整。不少国营商店和供销合作社为了争取小商小贩多从本单位进货，更加注意对商品的保管、陈列，注意及时清点仓库，补充货物，合理处理变质的商品。第四区供销合作社的副食品资金周转速度，因此从7月份的零点七六次增加到8月份的零点八三次。有些单位还每天派人与农业社联系，了解消费者的需要。
    在改变了市场管理办法以后，小商小贩都积极利用旧有的关系去组织货源，增加商品品种，他们的营业额和收入普遍增加了。第三区和第八区的小商贩8月份的总营业额比6月份分别增加一半到一倍以上。第三区过去有三分之二的小商贩的营业额不能达到营业税的起征点，现在则有三分之二的小商贩达到了；全区有困难的小贩原有二十八户，现在减少为八户。
    在开辟自由市场以后，虽然有某些供不应求的家禽种苗的价格曾上涨了一些，少数农业社对重要的大宗农产品由于发现邻地价格高而不愿履行原订的销售合同，少数农业社员想改农从商，国营商业和供销合作社对购销计划的掌握比过去较为困难，但是这些都不是自由市场开放后大量和主要的情况。对这些问题，当地财经部门目前正采取或准备采取许多措施加以解决，如掌握主要货源，加强市场的价格管理，组织农副产品的交易市场，根据商品流转方向修改购销计划，加强对农副业生产的指导，注意教育农民、小商贩和公私合营商店的人员以及加强各国营商业单位之间的联系等。
