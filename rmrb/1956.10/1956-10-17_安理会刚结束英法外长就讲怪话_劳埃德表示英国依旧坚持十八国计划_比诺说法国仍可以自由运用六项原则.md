Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th: Immediately After Security Council Meeting, British and French Foreign Ministers Utter Strange Remarks.
Lloyd Indicates Britain Still Adheres to the Eighteen-Nation Plan
Pineau Says France Can Still Freely Apply the Six Principles

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: New York dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd returned to London from New York on the evening of the 15th. Before his departure, he issued a statement indicating that Britain will continue to try to force Egypt to act according to the West's eighteen-nation plan.

Lloyd made it clear that Britain still believes that the eighteen-nation plan, which stipulates "international control of the canal," is the "best tool" for resolving the Suez problem. He said that the eighteen-nation proposal not only stated certain "necessary conditions" that the system for free use of the canal should guarantee, but also "most importantly, they stated what we see as the only means to do so. … Since there is no other alternative proposal that can achieve the same necessary conditions, we should uphold them."

Lloyd said: In the course of the Security Council's proceedings, some exploratory talks were held, the purpose of which "was to study with the Egyptian government how they propose to implement the necessary conditions that were later identified as common ground." He said, "Some progress has been made in the talks, but major differences still exist."

Lloyd demanded that the Egyptian government "immediately publish proposals regarding a system that not only meets these necessary conditions but also provides users with guarantees as effective as those sought by the eighteen-nation proposal." He threatened that if Egypt did not do so, it would create a "very serious situation."

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Paris dispatch: French Foreign Minister Pineau returned to Paris by plane from New York on the 15th. At the airport, Pineau said that the result of the Security Council's vote (on the Suez Canal issue) provided an agreement in principle. But he also said that because the Soviet Union vetoed the second part of the Anglo-French proposal, France remains free to apply the six principles that have been adopted.

Pineau indicated that the French cabinet will decide what further measures to take after listening to his report on the Security Council debate.

Pineau also said that he would have lunch with Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov, who was passing through Paris on the 16th, and might take the opportunity to discuss the Suez issue.

    安理会刚结束英法外长就讲怪话
    劳埃德表示英国依旧坚持十八国计划
    比诺说法国仍可以自由运用六项原则
    新华社16日讯　纽约消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德15日晚上从纽约返伦敦。他在行前发表声明，表示英国将继续设法迫使埃及按照西方的十八国计划行事。
    劳埃德表明，英国仍然认为，规定“国际管制运河”的十八国计划是解决苏伊士问题的“最好的工具”。他说，十八国建议不仅申述了关于自由使用运河的制度应该保证的某些“必要条件”，而且“最重要的，它们申述了我们看来是能这样做的唯一手段。……由于没有任何其他可能达到同样的必要条件的替代建议，我们应该维护它们”。
    劳埃德说：在安全理事会的进程中，作了一些探讨性的会谈，会谈的目的“是同埃及政府研究他们如何提出建议来执行后来被确定为共同基础的必要条件”。他说，“会谈取得了一些进展，但是仍然存在很大的分歧。”
    劳埃德要求埃及政府“立即公布关于不但符合这些必要条件，而且又向使用国提供同十八国建议所谋求的同样有效的保证的制度的建议”。他威胁说，如果埃及不这样做，那将会造成一种“非常严重的局势”。
    新华社16日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部长比诺15日乘飞机从纽约回到巴黎。在机场上，比诺说，安全理事会（就苏伊士运河问题）投票的结果提供了在原则上的协议。但是他又说，由于苏联否决了英法提案的第二部分，所以法国仍然可以自由运用已经通过的这六项原则。
    比诺表示，法国内阁将在听取了他关于安全理事会辩论情况的报告后，决定采取什么样的进一步措施。
    比诺还说，他将在16日同路过巴黎的苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫共进午餐，并且可能趁机会讨论苏伊士问题。
