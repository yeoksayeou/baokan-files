    Possible Oil-Bearing Structures Discovered in Tanggula Mountain Region

    (Our dispatch) Geological Team 632 of the Ministry of Geology has discovered six possible oil-bearing structures in the Tanggula Mountain region. These six structures are distributed near the Niubao, Xiao Ge'er Co, Quzongkou, and Lunbola basins. They generally have good closure, complete structures, and considerable area, and show signs of oil and gas. In the axial part of the Niubao structure, there is extensive and strong natural gas, as well as asphalt and oil-impregnated sandstone.

    While conducting petroleum prospecting, the exploration personnel also discovered a coalfield of industrial value, dozens of iron ore deposits, and mineral deposits such as borax and gypsum. In the Tanggula Mountain region, granite and quartz are also widely distributed.
