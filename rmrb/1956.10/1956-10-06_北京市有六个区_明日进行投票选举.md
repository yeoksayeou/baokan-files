Xinhua News Agency, October 5th—The six urban districts in Beijing that are the last to conduct this year's grassroots elections will hold voting elections on October 7th.

Many workers, who play a backbone role in socialist construction, have been nominated as candidates this time. Among them are Li Zongshun, who consistently overfulfills his tasks and helps backward workers to progress; Liu Sichang, a Beijing model worker known as the "King of Tricks"; and Song Xiangru, a veteran technician who has worked at the Tongrentang pharmacy for more than forty years. Zhang Deliang, director of the No. 2 Water Source Plant of the Beijing Waterworks Company, was a representative of the previous Dongsi District People's Congress. Because he is enthusiastic about serving the voters, he has been nominated as a candidate again this time.

Among the candidates are also teachers, salespersons, nursery directors, doctors, and government cadres, all of whom have earned people's respect with their outstanding work performance. Many capitalists who actively work in joint state-private enterprises have also been nominated by the people as candidates.

Cleaners, barbers, bathhouse workers, and cooks, who were looked down upon before liberation, now also have people nominated as candidates for people's representatives.

Voters have conducted full discussions and deliberations on each candidate in advance. During the discussions, voters also criticized the shortcomings of the candidates, and many candidates also made self-criticisms at voter meetings.

According to the election law, if voters disagree with the candidates already nominated, they can independently elect the people they are satisfied with.
