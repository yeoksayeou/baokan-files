Xinhua News Agency, 14th Dispatch: An International News Service dispatch from Bangkok reports: “A fierce anti-American tide is sweeping through Thailand’s formerly friendly press, causing concern among American diplomatic and military circles.”

The dispatch states, "It is pointed out that about half of the twenty-three newspapers in Bangkok are using prominent space to publish anti-American news, indicating that a potentially dangerous sentiment towards the United States is widespread."

The dispatch believes that the recent anti-American wave in Thai newspapers was triggered by the incident on September 17th, in which five American soldiers beat up Thai people. However, the dispatch acknowledges that although this incident occurred long ago, anti-American sentiment has been growing, and newspapers continue to criticize the Manila Treaty Organization's military plans and US "aid" programs.

The International News Service dispatch quotes American diplomats as saying, "The fact is that the Thai people are probably somewhat tired of being taught by the United States what they should do. After a period of time, they feel resentment about this."

The dispatch mentions Thailand's tendency to adopt a more neutral policy, stating, "American military personnel are particularly alarmed by this prospect. They point out that Thailand is now practically the only Southeast Asian country that is still closely aligned with the West, and if Thailand wavers, the very existence of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization itself may be in danger."

    泰国报界反美浪潮高涨
    马尼拉集团军事计划和美国“援助”不断遭到抨击
    新华社14日讯　美国的国际新闻社从曼谷发出的消息说：“一个猛烈的反美浪潮正在席卷泰国的态度一度友好的报界，这引起了美国外交界和军界的担心。”
    消息说，“据指出，在曼谷的二十三家报纸中约有半数用显著的版位来刊登反美新闻，这表明了一种对美国可能有危险的情绪是很普遍的。”
    消息认为最近泰国报纸的反美浪潮是由于9月17日五个美国兵殴打泰国人的事件引起的。但是，消息承认，虽然这个事件已经过去很久，反美情绪一直在增长，报纸继续抨击马尼拉条约组织的军事计划以及美国“援助”计划。
    国际新闻社的消息引述美国外交界人士的话说：“事实是，泰国人对于由美国来教他们应该做什么事情的作法恐怕有些厌烦了。在经过了一个时期之后，他们对这感到愤懑了。”
    消息谈到泰国采取比较中立的政策的倾向说，“美国军人对这样一种前景特别惊慌。他们指出，泰国现在实际上是仍然紧紧地跟西方在一起的唯一的东南亚国家，如果泰国动摇，东南亚条约组织本身的存在就可能发生危险。”
