    Separate the Protection of Draught Animals from the Slaughter of Meat Animals
    He Yaoming
    There are 5,369 inferior livestock (cattle, donkeys) in the mountainous areas of Xingtai County, Hebei Province, accounting for 30% of the total number of livestock. Most of these inferior livestock are in the deep mountainous areas and are managed by individual members of the commune, who hire people to graze them in herds. As a result of cross-breeding, these livestock are no more than two and a half feet tall and four feet long. They cannot be ridden, cannot carry loads, and cannot pull plows. Therefore, farmers call such livestock "meat animals." Farmers treat them as a kind of household sideline business because of their fast breeding (a cow gives birth to a cow, four cows in three years), low cost (usually grazing in the mountains, eating some grain straw, wheat straw, bean stalks, and dishwater, rotten melons and leftover fruits on rainy and snowy days, only paying the wages of grazing workers and taking turns managing them for a few days), and fast profit. This is beneficial for supplying the market with meat, leather, and increasing farmers' income.
    After collectivization, in order to free up their hands and feet to participate more in the commune's labor and earn more income, the commune members had a tendency to dump the meat animals; at the same time, farmers with large livestock were worried that the valuation of livestock entering the cooperative would be unreasonable and the repayment time would be long, so they planned to sell the livestock before joining the cooperative, with the money going to themselves for convenient spending. At that time, in order to stop the indiscriminate selling and slaughtering, strict livestock protection policies were adopted. Selling livestock required the approval of the agricultural cooperative, and the examination of the slaughter of old and disabled livestock was also relatively strict. This was beneficial for the protection of draught animals during the transformation of production relations.
    However, new problems arose during implementation. In many places, draught animals were confused with meat animals. The tax authorities indiscriminately implemented the rule that "only old livestock over the age of fourteen can be slaughtered," otherwise it would be considered a violation of the livestock protection policy. In fact, meat animals raised to the age of fourteen can only be sold for more than ten yuan. Raising a chicken can earn three yuan per year. A chicken can lay eggs for three years out of its four-year lifespan, which can still earn nine yuan. Therefore, the saying that raising meat animals is not as good as raising chickens and that one cow is not as good as one chicken has arisen among the masses. Although the meat supply is tight and the masses are willing to sell, the tax authorities do not allow the slaughter of meat animals, and the food companies cannot purchase them, which has dampened the farmers' enthusiasm for raising livestock. A farmer in Chengjitou Village raised five meat animals and had to manage the meals of the herders and pay their wages, but he could not sell them for profit. He asked to give them to the commune free of charge, but the commune did not accept them. Helpless, he had to let his child who was attending school drop out to herd the livestock. The child was very dissatisfied because the meat animals caused him to drop out of school, hated the cows for being pregnant, and hated them for not dying, often beating the cows out of anger. A farmer in Nian'ergou Village who raised meat animals felt that "it is useless to raise them, illegal to kill them, the commune does not accept them, and no one wants them," so he pushed a donkey foal into the river and drowned it. Cases of beating young livestock to death have also occurred in other villages.
    In order to prevent such things from continuing to happen, the protection of draught animals and the slaughter of meat animals should be treated separately, and the restriction that "only those over the age of fourteen can be slaughtered" should be abolished for meat animals. Of course, the second generation of inferior female livestock bred through the mating of superior male livestock will gradually improve. As long as the inferior are regularly culled and the superior are retained, the promotion of good breed mating, and timely castration of inferior male livestock, more and more good livestock will be gradually bred. The problem is to gradually improve the inferior livestock, and not to block the way out for inferior livestock all at once.

    保护耕畜和宰杀菜畜要分开
    何耀明
    河北省邢台县山区有劣畜（牛、驴）五千三百六十九头，占牲畜总头数的30％，这些劣畜大部分在深山区，由社员个人经营，雇人成群放牧。由于杂交乱配的结果，这些牲畜高不过二尺半，长不过四尺左右。不能骑、不能驮、拉不动犁，因此，农民把这样的牲畜称为“菜畜”。农民根据它繁殖快（母牛生母牛，三年四只牛）、下本小（平日上山放牧，雨雪天在家吃点谷草、麦秸、豆秧及涮锅水，烂瓜剩果等，仅给放牧人工资和轮流管几天饭）、得利快的特点，把它当成一种家庭副业来经营，这对供应市场肉食、皮革和增加农民收入等方面都是有利的。
    合作化以后，社员为了腾出手脚，多参加社里劳动，多得收入，对菜畜有倾销的情绪；同时有大牲畜的农民，又顾虑牲畜入社折价不合理，还款时间长，打算在未入社前把牲口卖掉，款归自己，花着方便。当时为了制止滥卖滥杀现象，采取了严格的保畜政策，卖牲口需经农业社的批准，对老残牲畜宰杀的审查，也比较严格。这样作在生产关系变革中对耕畜保护是有利的。
    但是执行中出了新问题，不少地方把耕畜与菜畜混同起来了，税务部门无分别的执行“十四岁口以上的老畜才能宰杀”，否则便认为是违犯保畜政策。其实菜畜养到十四岁口也不过卖十多元，养一只鸡每年可收入三元，鸡活四年下蛋三年，尚可收入九元，因此在群众中便产生了养菜畜不如养鸡和一只牛不如一只鸡的说法。税务部门不允许宰杀菜畜，虽然肉食供应紧张，群众愿意出卖，食品公司也不能收买，这就打击了农民养牲畜的积极性。城计头村有一个农民，喂养五头菜畜，要管放牛人的饭，给放牛的工资，却不能出卖得利，他要求无偿地送给社里，社里又不收，无奈只好让自己上学的孩子退学牧放，孩子因菜畜使自己失学，很不满意，恨牛怀孕，恨牛不死，常常打牛出气。念儿沟一户养菜畜的农民，感到“养之无用，杀之违法，社里不收，给人不要”，便将一头驴驹推到河内淹死。其他村也曾发生打死幼畜的事。
    为了不再使这样的事情继续发生，应该把保护耕畜与宰杀菜畜分别对待，废除对菜畜也执行“十四岁口以上才能宰杀”的限制。当然劣母畜通过优良种公畜的配种，生养的第二代会逐渐好起来的，只要经常去劣留优，推广良种交配，及时对劣种公畜进行割?，便会逐渐繁殖出更多的好牲畜来。问题是要逐步的改良劣畜，而不能一下子把劣畜的去路堵死。
