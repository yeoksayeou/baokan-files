Moscow Correspondence

    Hearts Linked Together
    Dai Feng

    When night falls on Moscow, the red stars of the high Kremlin and the tall buildings, bathed in brilliant lights as if transparent, create a fascinating and fantastical scene in the dark sky. At this time, the subway is at its busiest of the day. Despite trains speeding past every minute or two, the magnificent station halls and the escalators running day and night are crowded with a constant stream of people...

    I walked past Kiev Station to the cultural lounge of the "Young Pioneer" cinema, located in an exquisitely decorated room on the second floor. Upon entering, one could see rows of sofas around the tables. It was filled with audience members waiting for the last movie showing, holding newspapers and magazines of the day. Upon entering, I felt something different from usual, as if many people's gazes were focused on me.

    Sure enough, something happened. A hand reached out from my left and gently pulled me. When I turned my head, he said, "Please sit next to me!"

    I sat down in an empty seat.

    "I read the report of your party's congress published in 'Pravda'," the Soviet man said to me with a smile. "Tell me about it! What does 'learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and cure the sickness to save the patient' mean? What is a 'Zhuge Liang Conference'? How do you understand 'from the masses, to the masses'?"

    I explained to him softly, and he asked a dozen more questions about the report of our Party's Eighth National Congress. Finally, he excitedly told me that his name was Alexander Petrovich Shenylov, forty-two years old, and he came from the city of Ryazan, two hundred kilometers away from Moscow. He said, "Since September 16th, I have been reading the reports and speeches of the Eighth National Congress every day without interruption, just like we read the documents and speeches of the 20th Congress of the CPSU. Many of my friends were very happy after reading the report, but there were some things they didn't understand. Now that you've explained it to me, I can be an interpreter when I go back."

    There were only twenty minutes left until the movie started. Looking around, the lounge was getting more and more crowded, and the newspapers and magazines piled on the tables were long gone. At least half of the audience was intently reading the reports and speeches of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Peng Dehuai, Li Lisan, and others.

    This couldn't help but remind me of the scene I saw at Moscow University on the morning of September 24th. In the spacious building, I was completely captivated by the exhibits on the walls and the surrounding crowds. The documents of the Eighth National Congress, "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party," and many works written by Soviet writers who had visited China were displayed in two glass cases. Most notable was the graduation thesis of Shlyogin, a fifth-year student in the Economics Department, "Several Issues in China's Socialist Transformation." At this time, several young people walked past me. I heard one of them excitedly saying, "I read Comrade Li Lisan's speech today, it's very interesting, it made me understand the great power of the Chinese Communist Party even more." The Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party has recently become the center of conversation for students at Moscow University.

    I met Sashigulov, a fifth-year student, who is a neighbor of our country's Xinjiang. His home is on the Kyrgyz steppe. During World War II, he joined the Red Army and went to Northeast China.

    "You've come at the right time, I was just about to talk to you," he said, taking a stack of "Pravda" from the bookshelf, flipping through it as he spoke. "I have carefully read the reports and speeches of Comrades Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Dong Biwu."

    "What about Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report?" I casually asked.

    "I haven't read it," he said with great regret. "You know, I got up early to buy a newspaper, but there were even more people who got up earlier than me. They had already bought up all the 'Pravda'. It wasn't easy for me to buy these few copies."

    He paused for a moment and then said, "I have read Comrade Mao Zedong's 'On Practice' and 'On Contradiction' before. This time, after reading the report of the Eighth National Congress, I further understood the style of your party's combination of theory and specific practice, and its creative application of the principles of Marxism-Leninism."

    I saw him carefully marking the materials of Comrade Dong Biwu's speech with a blue pen, making notes. He marked one place particularly clearly: "Our people's democratic regime belongs to the most democratic socialist type in the world... Our people's democratic legal system also draws on all the beneficial experiences for the people in our history and internationally, especially the advanced experience of the Soviet Union."

    As I left the "Young Pioneer" cinema lounge, I remembered what Comrade Turgunov, the director of the People's Democratic Countries Department of "Pravda," told me yesterday. He said, "For more than ten days, 'Pravda' has continuously published the documents of the Eighth National Congress. Many, many readers often call us, some to thank us, some to ask us questions, and some to ask us to convey their respects to the Chinese people. Really, the Eighth National Congress, like the 20th Congress of the CPSU, is also a major event in the lives of the Soviet people!"

    Night slowly descended on the streets of Moscow. The windows of every house lit up with bright lights. People in Moscow go to bed relatively late, and these tranquil and moving lights aroused my deep thoughts. I thought: What are the people in this city thinking about now? What are they talking about? What are they doing? Under these brilliant lights, I know Mrs. Semyonova, a seventy-eight-year-old woman who lives on the seventh floor, apartment 103, on Dudov Street. These days, she asks her daughter, Amyandova, a Russian teacher at Moscow University, to read the reports and speeches of the Eighth National Congress to her every night. I remembered what old man Kochakho, a sixty-six-year-old with gray hair, from the Moscow Automotive Electrical Materials Factory, had said to me. He said, "I read the report of your Eighth National Congress and saw the creative leadership of your party, and the new life of the socialist society that you are about to enter. Like everyone else, I really want to go to China to see it with my own eyes!"

    On the day the Eighth National Congress concluded, I visited the Moscow Kuibyshev Electric Transformer Factory. As soon as I walked into the office of the Party Committee Secretary, Comrade Kabinov, the Party Committee Secretary, and Comrade Kochichkov, a member of the Party Committee, told me that all the 3,000 workers in the factory were happy after reading the report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan. The factory has given five reports in the past month introducing China's socialist construction. Kochichkov said, "The workers in our factory have very close relations with the Chinese workers. Not long ago, the large transformers made in our factory were sent to China, and the Chinese interns sent to our factory have not been interrupted."

    After Comrade Kochichkov accompanied me to visit the "Exhibition of the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party" held by the factory itself, we walked into the second largest workshop together. We happened to meet the factory director, Kirichenko. Kirichenko immediately pulled me inside, saying, "Check the largest electrical transformer that is about to be shipped to you!" Before me was a large black circular transformer more than two people tall.

    "We are still waiting for your new tasks!" Kochichkov said to me as we walked out of the workshop.

    In these days, I have met many Soviet workers, engineers, party workers, students, staff and housewives. They talked to me about their views on the Eighth National Congress, their thoughts, experiences and questions after reading the congress documents. They love the Chinese people and love our great socialist construction even more. Every conversation I have with them is always memorable.

    Oh, motherland! Although Moscow is so far away from you, although it has already started snowing in Moscow a few days ago, the brotherly friendship of the Soviet people towards China has always filled people's hearts with warmth. Beijing and Moscow are so close!
                  (September 30th)

    心连着心
    戴枫
    当黑夜来到莫斯科的时候，高高的克里姆林宫的红星和一幢一幢好像透明似的沐浴在光辉灿烂的灯火中的高层建筑物，在漆黑的天空，构成了一种迷人的奇幻的景象。这时候的地下铁道是一天最忙碌的时候，尽管是隔一两分钟就有一次车疾驶而过，但在宫殿般的辉煌的车站大厅里，在日夜运行的自动扶梯上，都挤满了川流不息的人群……
    我走过基辅车站，到了“少年先锋队”电影院的文化休息室里，这个休息室设在二楼一间极为精美的房间里。进门就可以看到桌子的四周是一排排沙发。那里坐满了等待最后一场电影的观众，他们的手里拿着当天的报纸、杂志，一走进门口，好像感到和往日有些不同，好像有很多人的目光都集中向我射来。
    果然，事情发生了。我的左边伸来了一只手，它轻轻地拉着了我，等我转过头来，他就说：“请在我旁边坐吧！”
    我在一个空位置上坐了下来。
    “我读了‘真理报’上登载的你们党的代表大会的报告。”那位招呼我坐下的苏联人笑着对我谈：“给我讲讲呀！什么叫做‘惩前毖后，治病救人’？什么叫做‘诸葛亮会议’？如何理解‘从群众中来，到群众中去’？……”
    我轻声地给他解释着，他又一连问了十几个有关我们党的八次大会报告中的问题。最后他兴奋地告诉我，他叫阿历克山·彼得罗维奇·雪尼洛夫，四十二岁，是从远离莫斯科二百公里的梁赞城来的。他说：“从9月16日开始，我没有间断过一天读八次大会的报告或发言，就像我们阅读苏共第二十次代表大会的文件和发言一样。我的很多朋友读了报告都很高兴，就是有些问题不太懂得。刚才你给我讲了，这次回去我可以当解释员去了。”
    距离开演电影只有二十分钟了。环顾四周，休息室里，人越聚越多，堆放在桌子上的报纸、杂志早就没有了。足足有一半观众在聚精会神地读着刘少奇、周恩来、彭德怀、李立三等同志的报告和发言。
    这不禁使我想起9月24日清晨我在莫斯科大学看到的情形。在宽敞的大楼里，我完全被墙壁上的展览品和周围的人群所吸引了，在两个玻璃架里展出了八次大会的文件，“毛泽东选集”，“中国共产党的三十年”以及很多苏联作家访问中国所写的著作。最引人注目的是经济系五年级学生雪略金的毕业论文“中国社会主义改造中的几个问题”。这时候，有几个青年在我的身旁走过。我听到其中有一个正在兴致勃勃地说：“我读了今天李立三同志的发言，很有趣，它使我更了解中国共产党的伟大的力量。”中国共产党第八次全国代表大会，最近几乎成了莫斯科大学学生们的谈话的中心。
    我见到了五年级学生沙西古洛夫，他是我们祖国新疆的邻居，他的家住在吉尔吉斯草原上。二次大战时，他参加过红军，到过中国的东北。
    “来得正好，我正想和你谈谈呢。”他一面在书架上取下了一堆“真理报”，一面翻阅，一面说：“我已经仔细地读过了毛泽东、彭德怀、董必武同志的报告和发言。”
    “刘少奇同志的报告呢？”我随口问一句。
    “没有读。”他非常遗憾地说：“你知道，我起早去买报，但有更多的人却比我起得还早。他们早把‘真理报’买光了。我买到这几份报还并不容易呢。”
    他沉默了片刻接着说：“以前我念过毛泽东同志的‘实践论’、‘矛盾论’。这次我读了八次大会报告，我进一步体会到了你们党的理论与具体实际相结合的作风，创造性地运用了马克思列宁主义原理。”
    我看到他在董必武同志发言材料上注意地用蓝色钢笔划线作着记号。有一个地方他划得特别明显“我们人民民主政权是属于世界上最民主的社会主义的类型……我们的人民民主法制，还吸取了我国历史上和国际上一切对人民有益的经验，特别是苏联的先进经验。”
    在我离开“少年先锋队”电影院休息室的时候，我记起了“真理报”人民民主国家部主任土尔古诺夫同志昨天对我说的话，他说：“十几天来‘真理报’连续登载了八大文件，很多很多读者经常给我们来电话，有向我们道谢的，有向我们提问题的，有要求我们向中国人民转达敬意的。真的，八次大会和苏共二十次大会一样，也是苏联人民生活中的一件大事！”
    夜，缓步降临到莫斯科的大街上。家家的窗户都亮起通明的灯火。莫斯科的人睡得都是比较晚的，这恬静的动人的灯火引起了我的深思。我想：这个城市里的人们现在在想着什么呢？谈着什么呢？他们在做着什么呢？在这绚烂的灯光下面，我知道住在笃道夫大街第七楼一零三号的七十八岁的老太太雪密诺娃。这些日子以来，她每天晚上总要叫她的女儿、莫斯科大学俄文教员阿米昂道娃给她念八次大会上的报告和发言。我记起莫斯科汽车电料工厂六十六岁白发斑斑的科柴霍老人对我说过的话。他说：“我读了你们八次大会的报告，看到了你们党的创造性的领导，看到了你们即将来到的社会主义社会新生活。我跟大家一样，多么想到中国去亲眼看看啊！”
    在八次大会结束的那一天，我访问了莫斯科古比雪夫电气变压器制造厂。一走进党委书记办公室，党委书记卡比诺夫、党委委员科契奇可夫同志就告诉我，全厂三千多工人读了关于第二个五年计划的建议的报告，都感到高兴。全厂最近一个月里曾作过五次报告，介绍中国社会主义建设情况。科契奇可夫说：“我们厂工人与中国工人关系十分亲密。不久前，我们工厂制出的大型变压器送到中国去了，我们厂里派来的中国实习生也没有间断过。”
    科契奇可夫同志陪我参观了这个工厂自己举办的“中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的展览会”后，我们就一同走进了第二大车间。偶然碰到了厂长基里钦科。基里钦科马上拉着我往里走，他说：“检查检查将要运到你们那里的最大的一个电气变压器吧！”在我的面前是一座有两人多高的黑色圆形的大变压器。
    “我们还等着你们的新任务呢！”走出车间时科契奇可夫对我说。
    这些天里，我见到的很多苏联工人、工程师、党的工作者、学生、职员和家庭主妇，他们跟我谈对八次大会的看法，谈读了大会文件之后的感想、体会和问题。他们热爱中国人民，更热爱着我国伟大的社会主义建设。他们每一次和我的谈话总是使人恋恋不舍，久久记忆。
    祖国啊！虽然是莫斯科离得你这样遥远，虽然是前几天莫斯科已经开始飘了雪花，但是苏联人民对于中国的兄弟般的友情，使人心里一直充满着温暖，北京和莫斯科是多么亲密啊！
                  （九月三十日）
