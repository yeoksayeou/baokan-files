    Support the Just Struggle of Powell and Others
    Six Hundred Million Chinese People Testify for Them
    The U.S. government's illegal persecution of honest journalists John William Powell and his colleagues has aroused indignation in every conscientious person. What "crime" have Powell and the others committed? The only reason is that they reported to the people of the world the facts and truth about the use of bacteriological weapons and other weapons of mass destruction by U.S. imperialism on the Korean battlefield. This is merely a just journalist fulfilling his duty. We ask the U.S. government: What "crime" have they committed?!
    It is a well-known fact that the U.S. imperialists openly launched bacteriological warfare and used weapons of mass destruction on the Korean battlefield in 1951. The bloodstains of the Korean and Chinese people killed by American-made bacteriological weapons are still fresh, and the tears of the relatives of the deceased have not yet dried! The towering crimes of the United States are irrefutable and cannot be denied! The U.S. government's attempt to cover up its bloodstained hands and prevent the American people from understanding New China by persecuting Powell is a futile and despicable goal.
    As a young Chinese student, I firmly protest against this illegal and heinous act by the U.S. government. All 600 million Chinese people will testify for Powell and the others. It is those who launched bacteriological warfare against the Korean and Chinese people, disregarding justice and humanity, who should be judged. Beijing Min Shui

    Stop the Unreasonable Trial of Powell and Others
    I am a future journalist, and when I saw the news in the newspaper about the U.S. government persecuting John William Powell and his wife and their companion Julian Schuman, it aroused my immense indignation. I express my deep sympathy and support for the Powells and Mr. Schuman, who are persevering in their struggle.
    Undoubtedly, this is another despicable provocation by the U.S. ruling clique against the peace-loving, democratic, and free American people, thereby spreading a "Cold War" atmosphere among them and creating anti-People's China hysteria.
    However, Washington's calculation has gone wrong this time. Neither the iron curtain, prisons, nor fines can suppress the extension of justice or stop the tide of peace and friendship. We, the Chinese people, are concerned about the struggle of the Powells and Mr. Schuman; we appeal to the whole world: stop the unreasonable trial of the Powells and Schuman to be held in San Francisco, and restore their personal freedom and civil rights.

    A Challenge to the Traditional Friendship Between the Chinese and American Peoples
    As an enthusiastic reader and contributor to the "China Weekly Review" (formerly the "Millard's Review"), I have always been very concerned about the safety of the Powells and Mr. Schuman after they returned to the United States. Now, the news has come that these three honest and selfless American journalists have been suffering persecution since returning to the United States, and the Powells and their two children sometimes have to face starvation! Recently, the U.S. authorities have also "prosecuted" them for the trumped-up charge of "sedition" to intensify their persecution. The U.S. ruling clique uses such fascist methods to treat those journalists who are faithful to their duties.
    These three American journalists merely faithfully reported the vivid facts they saw and experienced in China and frankly stated their own views. Isn't this the least that a true journalist should do? Isn't this the least that an ordinary honest American citizen should fulfill? The actions of Powell and others are entirely what a conscientious person should do; the persecution of Powell and others by the U.S. authorities cannot but arouse the indignation of righteous humanity and the opposition of fair American public opinion. It is reported that many fair-minded Americans and social groups are taking action to support these three journalists who have fulfilled their duties. This shows that the U.S. authorities cannot cover up the eyes and ears of the world with one hand.
    The Powells and Mr. Schuman are honest American citizens and friends of the Chinese people. The remarks made by these three journalists and their unwavering insistence are nothing more than the friendly coexistence of the Chinese and American peoples and the development of the traditional friendship between the two peoples. The persecution of these three people by the U.S. ruling clique is actually a challenge to the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples! We oppose the persecution of Powell and others by the U.S. authorities and support the just struggle of Powell and others. Beijing Wang Pingyu

### 支持鲍惠尔等人的正义斗争

    支持鲍惠尔等人的正义斗争
    六万万中国人民为他们作证
    美国政府非法迫害正直的新闻工作者鲍惠尔等三人的恶行，使每一个有良心的人都感到愤慨。鲍惠尔他们到底犯了什么“罪”呢？唯一的原因就是他们向世界人民报道了美帝国主义在朝鲜战场上使用细菌武器和其它大规模毁灭性武器的事实和真象。这只不过是一个公正的新闻工作者尽了他的职责，请问美国政府：他们何“罪”之有？！
    美帝国主义者1951年在朝鲜战场公然发动细菌战和使用大规模的毁灭性武器，这是人所共知的事情。被美国制造的细菌武器所杀害的朝中人民的血渍犹新，死者的亲人眼泪未干！美国的滔天罪行铁证如山，不容狡赖！美国政府现在企图以迫害鲍惠尔来掩饰他鲜血淋淋的双手和阻挠美国人民对新中国的了解，这个卑鄙的目的是枉然的。
    作为一个中国的青年学生，我坚决抗议美国政府的这种非法恶行。全中国六万万人都要为鲍惠尔他们作证，应该被审判的正是那些不顾正义与人道曾对朝中人民发动细菌战的人们。　　北京　岷水
    停止对鲍惠尔等人的无理审判
    我是未来的新闻工作者，当我看到报纸上登载着美国政府迫害鲍惠尔夫妇和他们的同伴舒曼的消息，这引起我无比的愤慨。对正在坚持斗争的鲍惠尔夫妇、舒曼先生表示深厚同情和支援。
    毫无疑问，这是美国统治集团又一次向爱好和平、民主和自由的美国人民的卑鄙的挑衅，从而在他们中间散布“冷战”气氛，制造仇视人民中国的歇斯底里。
    但是，华盛顿这次算盘又打错了，无论铁幕、监狱、罚金都压制不住正义的伸张，阻挡不了和平与友谊的潮流。我们中国人民关心鲍惠尔夫妇和舒曼先生的斗争；我们向全世界呼吁：停止将在旧金山举行的对鲍惠尔夫妇、舒曼的无理审判，恢复他们的人身自由和公民权利。    中国人民大学国际新闻班学生　周铜
    对中美两国人民传统友谊的挑战
    作为“密勒氏评论报”一个热心的读者和撰稿人之一，我对于鲍惠尔夫妇和舒曼先生回国后的安全是一直非常关心的。现在，消息传来，这三个正直无私的美国新闻记者回到美国后，一直在遭受着迫害，而鲍惠尔夫妇和他们的两个孩子竟然有时候不得不面临着断炊的绝境！最近美国当局还以莫须有的“煽动叛乱罪”对他们“起诉”来加强对他们的迫害。美国统治集团就是以这样的法西斯手段来对待那些忠实于自己职责的新闻记者的。
    这三个美国记者不过是忠实地报道了他们在中国所亲眼看到和亲身经历的活生生的事实，并且坦然说出了他们自己的看法。这难道不是一个作为真正的新闻记者的人所应该起码作到的事情吗？这难道不是一个普通的诚实的美国公民所应该起码尽到的责任吗？鲍惠尔等人的所作所为完全是一个有良心的人所应该做的；美国当局对鲍惠尔等人的迫害，不能不引起正义人类的愤慨和美国公正舆论的反对。据报道，目前很多公正的美国人士和社会团体都纷纷采取行动声援这三个克尽自己职责的新闻记者。这说明美国当局想一手掩尽天下耳目是办不到的。
    鲍惠尔夫妇和舒曼先生是诚实的美国公民，也是中国人民的朋友。这三个新闻记者所发表过的言论以及仍然坚持不渝的无非是中美两国人民友好相处和发展两国人民的传统友谊。美国统治集团对这三个人的迫害实际上就是向中美两国人民之间的传统友谊挑战！我们反对美国当局对鲍惠尔等人的迫害，并支持鲍惠尔等人的正义斗争。
