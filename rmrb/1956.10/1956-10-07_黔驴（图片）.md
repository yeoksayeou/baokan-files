Text by Xue Fu

    I. In the past, there were no donkeys in Guizhou. A well-meaning person brought a donkey from elsewhere.
    II. When the donkey arrived, the owner had no use for it, so he let it graze at the foot of the mountain. A tiger saw it and was greatly surprised. Not knowing how capable this monster was, it hid in the woods to watch it secretly.
    III. After a while, the tiger quietly came out of the woods and cautiously approached it. It was both suspicious and fearful, unable to figure out how capable the donkey was.
    IV. Suddenly, the donkey brayed, and the tiger was so frightened that it ran away with its tail between its legs, thinking that this monster was going to eat it.

    一，贵州从前没有驴子。有个好事的人，从别处运来一头驴。
    二，驴子到这里，主人没有用，把它放在山脚下吃草。老虎看到大吃一惊。不知道这怪物有多大本领，便躲在树林里偷偷地看它。
    三，不一会，老虎就悄悄地走出树林试探着向它靠近。心里又疑又怕，摸不透驴子有多大本领。
    四，突然驴子一叫，老虎被吓得拖着尾巴就跑了，以为这怪物要吃它了。
