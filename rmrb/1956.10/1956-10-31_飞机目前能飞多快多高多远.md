Airplanes Currently: How Fast, High, and Far Can Airplanes Currently Fly?
Shi Chaoli

It has been more than seventy years since Russian naval officer Mozhaisky created the world's first airplane. In these seventy years, airplanes have undergone great development: their structure has evolved from simple wood and canvas to light and strong metal; their shape has evolved from complex supporting members to streamlined designs; their power has evolved from ten horsepower to tens of thousands of horsepower; their speed has evolved from tens of kilometers per hour to more than three thousand kilometers per hour (supersonic); their use has become widespread in all aspects of national defense and the national economy; and they have extremely diverse structural styles. Now let us look at the current state of airplane development.

Modern Airplanes are Very Diverse in Types and Uses

Airplanes are currently widely used in all aspects of national defense and the national economy, and their types are also very diverse. We all know that airplanes can be divided into two major categories according to their use: military and civilian. Military aircraft include bombers, fighters, attack aircraft, and reconnaissance aircraft. Civilian aircraft include passenger and mail planes, national economic aircraft (including agricultural, forestry, and fishery aircraft), as well as trainer aircraft and sports aircraft. These different aircraft have great differences in weight, size, and power. Some weigh more than a hundred tons, while others weigh less than one ton; some have wingspans (from wingtip to wingtip) as large as dozens of meters, while others are only a few meters. For example, a large passenger and mail plane can carry 220 passengers, with the cabin divided into upper and lower floors connected by stairs, and a total flying weight (including the airplane itself, personnel, cargo, fuel, luggage, etc.) of about 156 tons. The plane is equipped with ten turboprop engines, which can generate a total of more than 35,000 horsepower (the electricity consumption of a city with a population of 500,000 is only about 10,000 horsepower). The speed of this type of passenger and mail plane is not very high, only 500 to 600 kilometers per hour. However, modern jet passenger and mail planes, such as the Soviet "ТУ—104," can carry 50 passengers and fly at an altitude of 10,000 meters at a speed of more than 800 kilometers per hour.

Another type is the heavy long-range jet bomber, with a total flying weight of about 158 tons. The wingspan is more than 56 meters, and the eight jet engines installed can generate a total thrust of 36,320 kilograms. The maximum level flight speed of this type of aircraft can reach 1,050 kilometers per hour (the speed of sound at sea level is about 1,225 kilometers per hour). At this speed, converting the thrust into horsepower is about 140,000.

We are all familiar with the diverse uses of aircraft in the national economy. They can be used for forest fire prevention, spraying pesticides to kill locusts and other agricultural pests, spraying fertilizers on farmland, aerial photography, surveying, and measurement, scouting for fish schools at sea, and even helping with archaeology.

The Performance of Modern Airplanes is Very Superior

When it comes to flight performance, we always think that birds are much better than us humans. The opposite is true. We might as well compare with birds to see who flies faster, higher, and farther.

According to figures published by the International Aviation Federation in 1955, the world record for the maximum level flight speed of an airplane is 1,323 kilometers per hour. This has already exceeded the speed of sound. This was achieved by mass-produced jet fighters. As for experimental jet aircraft, they fly even faster. For example, an experimental aircraft equipped with a turbojet engine set a world record of 1,811.2 kilometers per hour this year. Another experimental aircraft equipped with a rocket jet engine reached a level flight speed of 2,650 kilometers per hour at an altitude of 21 kilometers, which is more than twice the speed of sound. According to reports, a similar type of rocket jet engine aircraft has recently reached a maximum speed of over 3,000 kilometers per hour. Birds fly much slower than this. The fastest flying bird—the eagle's level flight speed (not diving) is only about 110 kilometers per hour, which is less than one-twentieth of the speed of human flight.

Birds are also inferior in terms of flight altitude. The official world record for jet aircraft altitude is 20,092 meters. The aforementioned rocket jet experimental aircraft once flew to an altitude of 27,450 meters. This is more than three times higher than the world's highest peak—China's Mount Everest. The highest flying bird—the lammergeier—only flies at an altitude of about 6,000 to 7,000 meters, which is only one-quarter of the height of human flight. The world record for the "one breath" non-stop flight distance of an airplane is 18,081.99 kilometers, which is almost equivalent to flying back and forth between Beijing and Moscow three times. Birds that fly extremely far, such as pigeons, can only fly a few hundred kilometers. From the comparison of these figures, we can see that our human flying skills are far superior to those of birds, and there is really no need to envy them.

The above is what has been achieved in terms of flight performance by aircraft—airplanes—with people inside operating them. If it is an unmanned aircraft, such as a missile, it will fly faster, higher, and farther.

The Structural Style of Modern Airplanes is Diversified

Modern airplanes are not only exceptionally superior in performance, but also extremely diverse in their structural styles. In addition to the common type of airplane with a fuselage and a wing extending on each side, there are many other types that are rarely seen. For example, there is an airplane without a fuselage or tail, only a large wing. This reduces drag, and the wing is equipped with two or four engines. This is called a flying wing. In general airplanes, the wing and cockpit are in the front, and the tail is in the back, but there is a type of airplane that is the opposite—the tail is in the front and the wing is in the back, so that the pilot can see more clearly. That is called a canard aircraft. A major drawback of modern high-speed airplanes is that takeoff and landing must use very long runways, which increases the cost of airport construction and creates difficulties in flying. Therefore, there are helicopters, but helicopters are limited by the rotor speed, and the forward speed in the air cannot be too fast. To eliminate this drawback, there is now a helicopter-style airplane. It is equipped with two engines, and the propellers are larger than ordinary ones. During takeoff and landing, the blades rotate parallel to the ground, becoming two rotors, and the direction of the thrust is upward, making it take off and land vertically like a helicopter. When it is in the air and needs to move forward, the two rotors can rotate 90 degrees and become two propellers, with the thrust forward, making it move forward like an ordinary airplane to increase flight speed. In addition, there is a vertical takeoff and landing airplane, which is not equipped with rotors like a helicopter, but is of the ordinary type. However, when parked on the ground, it does not use three wheels, and the fuselage is roughly parallel to the ground, "lying" on the ground; instead, the nose is facing the sky, the fuselage is vertical to the ground, and it is supported by brackets, "squatting" on the ground. After the engine is started, it can take off vertically, and then rotate the fuselage 90 degrees in the air to be parallel to the ground, flying like an ordinary airplane. The landing procedure is reversed, first turning the nose to face the sky, and then slowly "squatting" down to the ground.

In our imagination, it would be great if there was something that could fly in the sky and run on the ground. In fact, this thing has already been manufactured. This is an automobile-style airplane. Its wings and tail are movable. There are four wheels under the fuselage, like a car, and the propeller is installed in the front. It can take off and land like a light airplane. After landing, remove the wings and tail, connect the engine and wheels, and it becomes a car that can run on the ground.

The wings of ordinary airplanes are flat, like a flat plate, and take up a considerable amount of space. Now there is an airplane with a ring-shaped wing, and the wing looks like a round barrel. The fuselage is supported in the center by several supporting members. A turbojet engine is installed in the fuselage. The fuselage and the wing form a ramjet engine. This airplane can take off and land vertically and can reach supersonic speeds.

Although the above styles are special, they still resemble airplanes to some extent. But now there is a "flying platform" that does not look like an airplane at all. It is a small platform in itself, and people stand on it. The piston engine installed under the platform has a propeller. When the propeller rotates parallel to the ground, the generated thrust is upward, which can make the platform take off from the ground.

From the examples given above, we can see that the changes in the structural style of airplanes have infinite possibilities. Relying on the creativity of aviation scientists and engineers, diversified styles can be obtained to adapt to the ever-expanding various different uses.

Higher Requirements

The development of airplanes to the current high level is not accidental. This is the result of the rapid development of science and engineering technology, and the close combination of theoretical research and experiments. It is difficult to imagine that without the theoretical research of high-speed aerodynamics and the experiments of supersonic wind tunnels, supersonic airplanes with appropriate shapes could be built. Without the invention of high-temperature-resistant alloys, which promoted the progress of jet technology, it would be difficult to imagine airplanes exceeding the speed of sound. Of course, without inventions and creations in construction technology, the mass production of airplanes would also be impossible.

Further development of airplanes seems to be on the one hand tending to fly faster, higher, and farther—using rockets to make interstellar voyages in a vacuum; on the other hand, it is for more widespread uses, lower prices, and popularization in all aspects of human life. Needless to say, these two aspects of development rely on the further efforts of scientists, engineers, and workers to raise aviation science and technology to a new and higher level.

    飞机目前能飞多快多高多远
    史超礼
    自从俄罗斯海军军官莫查伊斯基创造世界上第一架飞机，到现在已经有七十多年的历史了。在这七十多年中飞机有了很大的发展：它的构造由简陋的木料和蒙布发展到轻而坚强的金属；它的外形由复杂的支撑构件发展到简洁的流线形；它的动力由十多马力发展到几万马力；它的速度由每小时几十公里发展到三千多公里（超音速）；它的用途普及到国防和国民经济的各方面；它还具有极其多样化的构造型式。现在让我们来看一下飞机在目前发展的情况究竟是怎样的。
    现代飞机的种类和用途是非常繁多的
    飞机在目前广泛地应用到国防和国民经济的各方面，并且它的种类也非常繁多。我们都知道飞机按用途可以分为军用和民用两大类。军用机中有轰炸、歼击、强击和侦察等机种。民用机中又有旅客邮件机、国民经济用机（包括农业、林业、渔业……用机），还有教练机和体育运动用机等。这些不同的飞机在重量、尺寸和动力方面有着很大的差异。有的重到百多吨，有的不到一吨；有的翼展（由翼尖到翼尖的宽度）大到几十公尺，有的小到只有几公尺。例如一种大型旅客邮件机，可装载旅客二百二十人，座舱分上下两层，有楼梯连通，飞行的总重量（包括飞机本身以及人员、货物、燃料、行李等）约有一百五十六吨。机上装有十台涡轮螺旋桨式发动机，共计可以产生三万五千以上的马力（一个五十万人口城市的用电量只不过在一万马力左右）。这种旅客邮件机的速度并不太高，只有每小时五百到六百公里。可是现代喷气式旅客邮件机，如苏联的“ТУ—104，”却可以装载五十位旅客，在一万公尺的高空以每小时八百多公里的速度飞行。
    又有一种重型远距喷气式轰炸机，飞行总重量约一百五十八吨。翼展在五十六公尺以上，安装的八台喷气发动机共计可以产生推力三万六千三百二十公斤。这种飞机的最大平飞速度可以达到每小时一千零五十公里（海平面音速约每小时一千二百二十五公里）。在这个速度下，把推力换算成马力约有十四万。
    飞机在国民经济上的多种多样的用途更是我们所熟知的。它可以用来作森林防火，喷药杀灭蝗虫和农业上其他灾害，在农田上喷散肥料，从空中进行摄影、勘察和测量，在海上侦察鱼群，甚至还可以用来帮助考古。
    现代飞机的性能是非常优越的
    谈到飞行性能，我们总以为鸟类比我们人类要高明得多。事实却恰恰相反。我们不妨和鸟类比一下到底谁飞得更快、飞得更高、飞得更远。
    根据国际航空协会1955年发表的数字，飞机最大平飞速度的世界纪录是每小时1，323公里。这已经超过音速。这是成批生产的喷气式歼击机创造的。至于试验用的喷气飞机飞的还要快。例如一种装有涡轮喷气发动机的试验机，今年创造了每小时一千八百十一点二公里的世界纪录。另外一种装有火箭式喷气发动机的试验机，在二十一公里的高空，平飞速度达到每小时二千六百五十公里，约为音速的二倍多。根据报道，最近又有一种同类型的火箭式喷气发动机的飞机，最大速度已超过每小时三千公里。鸟类飞行速度比这要小得多。飞得极快的鸟——鹰的平飞速度（不是俯冲）不过每小时一百一十公里，还不到人类飞行速度的二十分之一。
    在飞行高度方面鸟类也较差。喷气飞机升高的正式世界纪录是二万零九十二公尺。前述火箭式喷气试验机曾经飞达二万七千四百五十公尺的高空。这比世界上最高的山峰——我国的珠穆朗玛峰要高三倍多。而飞得最高的鸟——山鹫的飞行高度仅约六千到七千公尺，只有人类飞行高度的四分之一。飞机“一口气”中途不着陆飞行距离的世界纪录是一万八千零八十一点九九公里，差不多等于在北京和莫斯科之间来回飞行三次。而飞得极远的鸟如鸽子也只能飞几百公里。由这些数字的比较可知，我们人类飞行的本领远比鸟类高明，实在用不着再去羡慕它们。
    以上所说的是有人在里面操纵的航空器——飞机，在飞行性能方面所获得的成就。若是无人在里面操纵的航空器，如导弹之类，那就飞得更快、更高、更远了。
    现代飞机的构造型式是多样化的
    现代飞机不但性能异常优越，而且它的构造型式也极其多样化。除了习见的一只机身、两旁各伸着一只机翼的普通型式的飞机以外，还有其他多种多样、平常少见的构造型式。例如有一种飞机没有机身和尾翼，只有只大机翼，这样可减少阻力，机翼上装有两台或者四台发动机。这种叫做飞翼。一般的飞机，机翼和座舱在前，尾翼在后，可是有一种飞机和这相反——尾翼在前而机翼在后，那样可以使驾驶员看得更清楚些。那叫做鸭式机。现代速度比较高的飞机有个大缺点是：起飞着陆必须使用很长的跑道，这就增加了机场建筑的费用，并且造成飞行方面的困难。因此就有了直升机，然而直升机受到旋翼转速的限制，在空中前进的速度不能太快。为了消除这个缺点，现在有了一种直升机式的飞机。它装有两台发动机，螺旋桨比普通的大，起飞和着陆时桨叶和地面平行地旋转，成为两副旋翼，产生拉力的方向向上，使它像直升机那样地直起直落。等到了空中要前进时，这两副旋翼又可以转九十度，变成两副螺旋桨，拉力向前，使它像一般飞机那样地前进，以增加飞行速度。此外还有一种垂直起落的飞机，不像直升机那样装有旋翼，而是普通的型式。不过停放地面时，不是用三只轮子，机身大致和地面平行，“平躺”在地面上；而是机头朝天，机身同地面垂直，用支架支撑着，“蹲”在地上。发动机开车后可以垂直离地起飞，到空中再把机身转九十度同地面平行，像普通飞机那样地飞行。着陆时程序倒过来，先把机头转成朝天，然后再徐徐向地面“蹲坐”下来。
    在我们的想像中，若是有这样一种东西，在天空能飞、在地面能跑，那就好了。实际上这种东西已经制造出来了。这就是汽车式的飞机。它的机翼和尾翼是活动的。机身下面有四只轮子，像一辆汽车，螺旋桨装在前面。它能够像一架轻型飞机那样地起飞和着陆。着陆后，把机翼和尾翼卸去，发动机和轮子接合起来，就变成一辆汽车，能够在地面行驶。
    一般的飞机的机翼都是平直的，好像一块平板，占的空间相当大。现在却有一种环形机翼的飞机，机翼像一个圆桶。机身用几根支撑件支在中央。机身中安装有涡轮式喷气发动机。机身和机翼之间又构成一具冲压式喷气发动机。这种飞机可以垂直起落，并且可以达到超音速。
    以上的型式虽然特殊，但多少还像飞机。可是现在有一种“飞行平台”，看起来却完全不像飞机。它本身是一个不大的平台，人就站在上面。台下装的活塞式发动机，带有螺旋桨，当螺旋桨和地面平行地旋转时，产生的拉力向上，就可以使这平台平地凌空。
    由上面所举的例子可以知道，飞机构造型式的变化是具有无限可能性的。依靠航空科学家、工程师的创造性，可以得到多样化的型式，以适应日益扩大的各种不同的用途。
    更高的要求
    飞机发展到目前的高度水平不是偶然的。这是科学和工程技术的迅速发展，以及理论研究和实验紧密结合的结果。很难想像没有高速空气动力学的理论研究和超音速风洞的实验会造出形状适当的超音速飞机。如果没有耐高温合金的发明，促成喷气技术的进步，也很难想像飞机会超过音速。当然，缺少施工技术上的发明创造，飞机的大量生产也是不可能的。
    飞机进一步的发展似乎是一方面趋向于飞得更快、更高、更远——利用火箭在真空中作星际航行；另一方面则是用途更广泛、价格更低廉、普及到人类生活的各方面。不用说，这两方面的发展都有赖于科学家、工程师和工人们的进一步努力，把航空科学技术提高到一个新的、更高的水平。
