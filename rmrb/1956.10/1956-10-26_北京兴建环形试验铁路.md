Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: Construction of a circular test railway for railway scientific research began on the eastern outskirts of Beijing on the 20th. This circular test railway includes a circular line 10 kilometers long, a straight section of over 1,000 meters within the circle, and five curves with radii from 200 to 1,000 meters. The construction project also includes a steam locomotive depot, internal combustion and electric locomotive depots, a rolling stock depot, a track laboratory, and other ancillary equipment and buildings.

After the completion of this circular test railway, it will be used by railway scientists to test the performance of various types of locomotives and rolling stock and their ancillary equipment, the mutual influence between locomotives and rolling stock and the track, the upper structure of the track, the thermal processes of power equipment, and the electrical equipment needed for the passage of electric locomotives, so as to identify new products and propose plans for transforming old equipment and adopting new technologies. The characteristic of these tests using the circular test railway is that they are close to actual conditions, and the test results can be directly applied to practical use.

This circular test railway is designed according to advanced Soviet standards. The rails used for laying the line will all be first-class products produced by Anshan Iron and Steel Company. The project will be carried out in three phases. The initial phase of the project is expected to be completed in September 1957.

    北京兴建环形试验铁路
    新华社23日讯　一条作为铁道科学研究用的环形试验铁路，20日在北京东郊动工兴建。这条环形试验铁路，包括一条长十公里的环形线路和环内长一千多公尺的直线一段、半径二百到一千公尺的曲线五条；建设工程并包括蒸汽机车库、内燃和电气机车库、车辆库、线路试验室，以及其他附属设备和建筑。
    这条环形试验铁路建成以后，将供铁道科学工作者进行各型机车车辆性能及其附属装置，机车车辆和线路相互影响及线路上部结构、动力设备的热工过程和为通行电气机车需要的电气装置等试验，以鉴定新产品和提出改造旧设备、采用新技术的方案。利用环形试验铁路作的这些试验的特点是接近实际，试验成果可以直接用于实际。
    这条环形试验铁路是根据苏联先进标准设计的。铺设线路用的钢轨将全是鞍山钢铁公司出产的一级品。工程分三期进行。初期工程预计在1957年9月完工。
