Xinhua News Agency, October 8th: The Chinese Olympic team's football selection tournament began this afternoon. In the first match, Hong Kong team faced Shanghai team, with Shanghai team winning six to one.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Deng Xiaoping and He Long, and others watched the match.

A total of four football teams are participating in this football selection tournament. The other two teams are the Joint Team Red and Joint Team White. They will hold a round-robin tournament.

Most of the players on the Joint Team Red are members of the Beijing Youth Football Team. The Joint Team White is composed of players from the Beijing Institute of Physical Education Football Team and the Beijing Youth Football Team.

On the afternoon of the 9th, the Hong Kong football team will also hold an exhibition match with the "August 1st" football team of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which is not participating in this selection tournament.

Xinhua News Agency, October 8th: The Chinese Olympic team's basketball selection tournament continued tonight. The Men's Basketball Team of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Public Security Army, the fourth-place winner of last year's national tournament, defeated the Macau Men's Basketball Team by a score of 120 to 63; the Men's Basketball Team of Shenyang, the second-place winner of last year's national tournament, defeated the Hong Kong Men's Basketball Team by a score of 99 to 50.

When the players of the Macau team and the Hong Kong team entered the court, the more than 5,000 spectators in the Beijing Gymnasium warmly applauded to welcome them. The Macau team and the Hong Kong team players demonstrated skillful side-stepping passing techniques and skilled feinting moves during the match today. However, their stamina and speed were slightly inferior, and they were also shorter than their opponents, so they lost to the Public Security Army team and the Shenyang team, which were energetic and good at fast breaks.

The Macau team adopted a zone defense method today, which at one point made it difficult for the Public Security Army team to organize fast breaks. They used accurate shooting and led 20 to 19 in the first ten minutes. Later, the Public Security Army team replaced him with Cai Jijie (No. 4), a player who is one meter and ninety centimeters tall, and it played a big role through his shooting under the basket and his coordination with other players' offense. Cai Jijie scored nineteen points alone in less than twenty minutes on the court today. However, the main scorer for the Public Security Army team today was the forward Wei Wenyuan (No. 15), who is good at jumping one-handed shooting. He scored forty-five of the one hundred and twenty points scored by the Public Security Army team.

The best performers for the Macau team today were the two forwards, Feng Yaoshen (No. 3) and Liang Bin (No. 10), who are only a little over one meter and seventy centimeters tall. They repeatedly dribbled the ball along the sideline, continuously feinting past several defensive players to score. Feng Yaoshen and Liang Bin both scored nineteen points today.

Most of the players on the Hong Kong team were former members of the Hong Kong United Team. They have rich experience in the competition. In the competition, they often use low passes and low dribbling methods, which made it difficult for the tall Shenyang players to grab the ball. Wu Naxiu (No. 11), Zhong Zhenpei (No. 7), and Pan Weiwen (No. 4), who played for the Hong Kong team today, were all skilled. They passed the ball quickly and had many methods, sometimes confusing the opponent.

The Shenyang team launched fast breaks whenever they had the opportunity today, and sometimes scored through the forward Wei Maokun (No. 7), who is one meter and ninety-one centimeters tall, shooting under the basket. They also often used man-to-man defense methods to make it difficult for the opponent to attack.

　　足球选拔赛开始，上海胜香港
    篮球选拔赛沈阳和公安军分别战胜香港澳门
    据新华社8日讯　中国奥林匹克运动队足球选拔赛今天下午开始，香港队同上海队第一次交锋，上海队以六比一获胜。
    周恩来总理，邓小平、贺龙副总理等观看了这场比赛。
    参加这次足球选拔赛的共有四个足球队，其他两个队是联队红队和联队白队。他们将举行循环赛。
    联队红队的大部分队员都是北京青年足球队的队员。联队白队是由北京体育学院足球队和北京青年足球队的队员组成的。
    9日下午，香港足球队还将同不参加这次选拔赛的中国人民解放军“八一”足球队举行一场表演赛。
    新华社8日讯　中国奥林匹克运动队的篮球选拔赛今晚继续举行，去年的全国第四名中国人民解放军公安军男子篮球队以一百二十比六十三胜澳门男子篮球队；去年的全国第二名沈阳男子篮球队以九十九比五十胜香港男子篮球队。
    当澳门队和香港队队员出场的时候，北京体育馆比赛馆中的五千多观众热烈地鼓掌欢迎他们。澳门队和香港队队员今天在比赛中都表现了巧妙的侧身隐蔽传球技术和熟练的虚晃过人动作。但是，他们的体力和速度稍差，个子也比对手矮，所以分别败给了体力充沛和善于快攻的公安军队和沈阳队。
    澳门队今天采取区域联防的办法，一度使公安军队在组织快攻时感到困难。他们用准确的投篮，在前十分钟曾经以二十比十九领先。后来公安军队换上了身高一公尺九十公分的队员蔡集杰（4号），通过他在篮下投篮和由他策应其他队员进攻，起了很大作用。蔡集杰今天上场不到二十分钟，一个人就得了十九分。但是，公安军队今天的主要得分手是善于跳起单手投篮的前锋魏文演（15号），在公安军队得的一百二十分中，有四十五分是他得的。
    澳门队今天表演得最出色的是两个身高都只有一公尺七十多公分的前锋冯耀燊（3号）和梁彬（10号），他们好多次一个人带球沿边线连续晃过对方的几个防守队员上篮得分。冯耀燊和梁彬今天都得了十九分。
    香港队的队员大部分都曾经是香港联队的队员，他们有着丰富的比赛经验，在比赛中经常用低传球和低运球的办法，使个子高大的沈阳队员在抢球时感到困难。香港队今天上场的吴那秀（11号）、钟振沛（7号）和潘炜文（4号）等人的技术都很熟练，他们传球快，方法也多，有时候使对方感到迷惑。
    沈阳队今天一有机会就展开快攻，有时候也通过身高一公尺九十一公分的前锋卫茂坤（7号）在篮下投篮得分。他们还经常用人盯人的办法来防守，使对方进攻的时候感到困难。
