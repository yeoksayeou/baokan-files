    A Complete Catalog of Dunhuang Manuscripts Stolen by British Imperialist Stein from China

    Over forty years ago, the imperialist cultural spy Stein stole a large number of precious manuscripts from the Dunhuang Thousand Buddha Caves in China, which are preserved in the British Museum in London. Until now, not a single catalog has been published. According to Japan's "Journal of Historical Science," Giles, who has been organizing these manuscripts for many years, has compiled a complete catalog, which was printed last year under the title "A Catalog of Chinese Manuscripts Discovered in Dunhuang." According to the "Far East" quarterly of the University of California, the contents of this complete catalog are divided into five parts: 1. Buddhism; 2. Taoism; 3. Manichaeism; 4. Non-religious books (including classics, history, legal documents, edicts, proclamations, contracts, foreign language books, etc.); 5. Appendix. (Ran)

    四十多年前，帝国主义文化间谍斯坦因在我国敦煌千佛洞盗窃了大批珍贵写本，保存在伦敦英国博物院里，到现在还没有出版过一本目录。据日本“史学杂志”报道，多年来从事整理这批写本的翟理斯，已经编就一个总目录，于去年付印，名为“在敦煌发见的中国写本目录”。根据美国加里佛尼亚大学“远东”季刊报道，这本总目录的内容分为五个部分：1．佛教；2．道教；3．摩尼教；4．非宗教书（包括经、史、法律文书、诏令、布告、契约、外国文字书籍等）；5．附录。　（然）
