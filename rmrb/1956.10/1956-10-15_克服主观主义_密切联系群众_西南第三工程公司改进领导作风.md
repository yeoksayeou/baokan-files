Kunming Dispatch from our Newspaper: The Southwest Third Engineering Company has improved its leadership style and enhanced the quality of its work. In the past, due to a shortage of cadres, the leading comrades were constantly occupied with meetings and signing official documents, etc. All work was decided upon merely through discussions among the leaders, with little effort to delve into the lower levels and solicit workers' opinions. They also showed insufficient concern for the workers' welfare, and coupled with inadequate political and ideological work, some workers experienced a period of unease. Since April, the company's leading comrades have paid attention to these problems and worked to overcome the bureaucracy and subjectivism that previously existed. They implemented a system of planning meetings, stipulating that monthly office meetings be held by the leading cadres of various engineering divisions, factories, stations, teams, and other functional departments to report on and study solutions to important production-related issues. Office meetings of the responsible comrades of the company's functional departments and affiliated enterprises are held weekly to report on the operational status of each unit and urgent problems requiring resolution. All issues requiring resolution at the meetings are submitted to the office in advance as proposals; in the event of major issues, written opinions are also submitted in advance and distributed to the participating comrades for preparation, thereby improving the quality of the meetings and reducing meeting time. Efforts are also made to ensure that official documents are concise and to the point, with face-to-face discussions used wherever possible, telephone calls used for resolutions whenever possible, and no documents issued unless absolutely necessary. This has enabled leading comrades at all levels to spend more time delving into the lower levels, listening to the opinions of the workers, and resolving various production-related issues and problems concerning the workers' lives. For example, they comprehensively studied the workers' welfare issues, listened to the workers' opinions, and resolved issues related to housing for workers and their families, as well as kindergartens, clubs, bathing, and hairdressing services. At the same time, they also investigated workers with financial difficulties and provided long-term or temporary assistance based on their individual circumstances. When drafting plans, they initially prepared a draft plan and then went to the various engineering divisions to discuss it with everyone, then returned to supplement and revise it, thereby avoiding subjectivism and making the plans practical. In order to be able to discover problems and summarize experiences in a timely manner, they frequently organized work groups to go down to understand the situation, and leading comrades also took turns going down, stipulating that they must go to the construction sites at least three times a week. Rationalization proposals from the masses are also handled as quickly as possible. As a result, the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers have been greatly stimulated, and engineering costs have been reduced. This year, due to tight transportation in Yunnan Province, many construction sites have repeatedly suspended work pending materials, but they are still confident of completing the annual plan two and a half months ahead of schedule.

### 克服主观主义　密切联系群众  西南第三工程公司改进领导作风

    克服主观主义　密切联系群众
    西南第三工程公司改进领导作风
    本报昆明讯　西南第三工程公司改进领导作风，提高了工作质量。过去这个公司因为干部少，领导同志整天忙于开会、签发公文等等，各项工作只是领导同志商量了就算，很少深入下层听取工人的意见。他们对工人的生活福利也不够关心，加上政治思想工作做得不够，部分工人曾一度有过不安情绪。4月份以来，公司的领导同志重视了这些问题，并注意克服过去所存在的官僚主义和主观主义。他们贯彻了计划会议的制度，规定每月开一次各工程处、厂、站、队等职能部门领导干部的办公会议，汇报并研究解决有关生产上的重要问题。公司各职能部门及附属企业负责同志的办公会议每星期召开一次，汇报各单位业务工作情况和急需解决的问题。凡须在会议上解决的问题，都事先把提案送交办公室；遇有重大问题，还事先提出书面意见印发给与会同志作准备，从而提高了会议的质量，减少了会议时间。对公文也力求做到少而精，可以面谈的尽量面谈，可以用电话解决的尽量用电话解决，可发可不发的公文一律不发。这样就使得各级领导同志有较多的时间深入下层，听取工人群众的意见，解决生产上和工人生活上的各种问题。例如，他们全面地研究了工人生活福利问题，听取工人的意见，解决了工人及其家属的住宅问题和托儿所、俱乐部、洗澡、理发等问题；同时并调查了生活困难的工人，分别情况给以长期补助或临时补助。在编制计划时，他们初步拟好计划后，就到各工程处去和大家商量，回来再补充修改，这样就避免了主观主义，使计划切合实际。为了能及时发现问题、总结经验，他们经常组织工作组下去了解情况，领导同志也轮流下去，并规定每星期至少下工地三次。对来自群众的合理化建议，也做到尽速的处理。因此，大大激发了工人的积极性和创造性，降低了工程成本。今年云南省因为运输紧张，不少工地虽曾一再停工待料，但他们还是有信心提前两个半月完成全年的计划任务。
