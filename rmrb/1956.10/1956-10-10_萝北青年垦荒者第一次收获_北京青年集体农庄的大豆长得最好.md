Xinhua News Agency, Luobei, 8th. The pioneers in the Luobei Youth Reclamation Area of Heilongjiang Province have begun their first harvest. Their year of hard work has now blossomed and borne fruit.

　　On the 6th, more than 50 male and female members of the Beijing Youth Collective Farm went out to harvest soybeans. Most of the members were harvesting with skilled knife techniques. There were also some young people who had never held a sickle before, and their harvesting was a bit clumsy. Liu Chunlan, the deputy captain of the production team, would occasionally stop her own work to teach these people how to use the knife. In the afternoon, the names of Zhang Deyong, Liu Shimin, Lin Fengrong and other nine people appeared on the bulletin, because they harvested quickly and cleanly.

　　On this day, many people in the Tianjin Youth Collective Farm were also praised. Wang Peisen, Li Yuanliang and others set a high record of harvesting 0.25 hectares in one day.

　　This year, the Luobei Youth Reclamation Area planted more than 3,000 hectares of grain, most of which are soybeans. The soybeans are growing very well. Local farmers say that they have never seen such good crops in the reclaimed wasteland in Luobei County in the past. According to the comparison of this year's and previous years' soybean growth, the Luobei County Committee of the Communist Party of China estimates that the average soybean yield per hectare in the entire reclamation area can reach 2,500 jin. The Beijing Youth Collective Farm, where soybeans grow best, can reach 2,800 jin per hectare.

　　萝北青年垦荒者第一次收获
    北京青年集体农庄的大豆长得最好
    新华社萝北8日电　黑龙江省萝北青年垦区的拓荒者已经开始第一次的收获。他们一年的辛勤劳动现在已开花结果。
    6日，北京青年集体农庄，有五十多名男女庄员出动收割大豆。大部分庄员都以熟练的刀法收割着。也有一些过去根本没有拿过镰刀的青年，收割时有点拙笨。生产队的副队长刘春兰，不时停下自己的工作，教给这些人用刀的方法。下午，快报上出现了张德勇、刘世敏和林凤荣等九人的名字，因为他们收割得又快又干净。
    这天，在天津青年集体农庄里，也有很多人受到称赞。王佩森、李元良等四人曾创了一天收割零点二五公顷的高额纪录。
    今年萝北青年垦区共播种三千多公顷谷物，其中绝大部分是大豆。大豆长得很好，当地农民说，在过去萝北县开垦的荒地中，从没有见过这样好庄稼。中共萝北县委员会根据今年和历年大豆生长情况比较，估计全垦区平均每公顷大豆能产到二千五百斤，大豆长得最好的北京青年集体农庄，每公顷产量能达到二千八百斤。
