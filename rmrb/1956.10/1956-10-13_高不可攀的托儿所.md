    Unreachable Nursery

    Just as the whole country was earnestly implementing the Central Committee's instructions on improving the lives of workers, the Chongqing Electric Power Bureau vigorously prepared to establish a nursery in May. When the news spread, the workers and their families burdened with children were unspeakably happy.

    However, when the admission requirements were announced, many felt that the conditions were too high to reach. Just mentioning the clothes required for children to enter the nursery is quite astonishing: cloth shoes, rubber shoes, leather shoes, and three sets of shirts, three sets of single-layer clothes, as well as lined clothes, cotton clothes, woolen clothes, mattress pads, and so on. To purchase everything would cost at least around one hundred yuan. The monthly childcare fee was 17.5 yuan per child, accounting for one-third of the average salary of employees in the entire bureau after the wage reform. With such high conditions, most of the workers who originally wanted to send their children to the nursery had to give up. As a result, only thirty people could barely afford to send their children.

    This nursery is jointly operated by the Chongqing Electric Power Bureau and the Chongqing Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building. It can accommodate a total of seventy children, and there are twenty-seven staff members, including a director, clerk, accountant, cashier, doctor, and nurse, all fully equipped. The Electric Power Bureau subsidizes each child by ten to twelve yuan per month. With so much money being spent, who exactly is benefiting? Looking at the list of parents of the children, besides the factory director, director, section chief, secretary, doctor, and engineer, there is not a single worker.

    高不可攀的托儿所
    正当全国各地认真贯彻中央关于改善职工生活的指示的时候，重庆电业局于5月间就大力筹办托儿所。消息一传出，有小孩拖累的职工和家属们，都有说不出的高兴。
    但是，当入所条件一公布，很多人都感到条件高不可攀。只要说一说儿童入所所需要的衣服，就相当惊人：要布鞋、胶鞋、皮鞋，还要三套衬衣、三套单衣和夹衣、棉衣、毛线衣、垫单等等。要购置齐全，少说也将要一百元左右。每名每月要交保育费十七元五角，占去工资改革后全局职工平均工资的三分之一。条件太高，原来想送子女入所的职工，大多数不得不打退堂鼓。结果，只有三十人勉勉强强可以入所。
    这个托儿所，是重庆电业局与第一机械工业部重庆办事处合办的，总共能容纳七十名儿童，所里的工作人员就有二十七个，所长、事务员、会计出纳、医生、护士各种人材，完备无缺。电业局每名每月要补助十到十二元。开支这样多的钱，究竟替哪些人解决了问题？看看儿童的家长名单，除了厂长、主任、科长、秘书、医师、工程师之外，连一个工人也没有。
