    French Progressive Cinema Advancing in Struggle

    We still remember the sincere, even fervent, emotion with which the French people applauded the performance of the Chinese Art Troupe in Paris last year. Today, we extend the same warm welcome to the French Film Week in China.
    French films are not only rich and diverse in subject matter and expression but also strongly express the French people's love of life and peace. Precisely because of this, French films have gained high international prestige and are loved by millions of viewers living in different social systems. From 1945 to 1956, French films won more than sixty major and minor awards at the Karlovy Vary, Cannes, and Venice International Film Festivals, which are representative. For example, among the films screened during this film week, "No Address Left" won the Best Director Award at the 1951 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, "Fanfan la Tulipe" won an award at the 1952 Cannes Film Festival, and "Forbidden Games" won the International Grand Prize at the 1952 Venice Film Festival.
    As a pioneer in the film industry, French cinema, although it has a long history of sixty-one years and produces an average of more than one hundred feature films each year, has traveled a rugged and extraordinary road. Excellent French filmmakers, both old and young, have used their most tenacious will and great talent to wage an unwavering struggle to maintain the national tradition and independence of film art. It is also by relying on them and the masses of people united around them that they have overcome various difficulties and achieved today's achievements.
    As we all know, the birth of film was the result of international research, but it is generally recognized that France played a decisive role in inventing film and spreading it to the world. The first moving pictures, including "The Exit from the Lumière Factory," were filmed by the French Lumière brothers. The Lumière brothers later opened their own film company, shooting many comedies and short films, and sending people around the world to promote, screen, and shoot films. Another veteran of the French film industry, Georges Méliès, created the world's first studio in 1897, bringing the style of feature films to the world, guiding film in the direction of drama, and pioneering the use of special effects photography. In addition, at almost the same time, French cinema produced a great film comedian like Max Linder. The series of comedies Linder performed were no longer purely farcical. His performances skillfully embodied the emotions of various characters, prompting people to think deeply and profoundly influencing the later comedy master Charlie Chaplin. All these early achievements of French cinema laid the foundation for this emerging art at the time.
    Before the outbreak of World War I, the French Pathé company had turned film into a huge enterprise, actively promoting films around the world. However, during the war, American films, with their favorable factors, began to seize the world market for French films, and even the French mainland was flooded with Hollywood films. After the war, the development of French films changed. Film artists and audiences demanded breakthroughs in film techniques and styles. As a result, impressionist and avant-garde films appeared in the French film industry one after another.
    Impressionist films appeared between 1920 and 1923. Its characteristic is attention to the composition of the picture and the rendering of the atmosphere. Film master Deluc, who belonged to this school, wrote on the title page of "Cinema Magazine," the first film publication in France that he founded: "French cinema should be cinema, and French cinema should be French." These two sentences represented the desire of film artists with innovative ideas at the time to make film an independent art.
    The later avant-garde films made further explorations, efforts, and painstaking research in the pursuit of film techniques. Several contemporary film masters and giants, such as René Clair and Jean Renoir, were all strong members of the avant-garde; after 1927, avant-garde films were influenced by the Soviet films "Battleship Potemkin" and "Mother," and their production attitudes changed somewhat. For example, the film "À propos de Nice" shot by the young director Jean Vigo in 1929 was able to use satirical and critical techniques to sharply contrast the hopeless life of the upper class at that time with the poverty of this ancient city.
    The arrival of sound films in the 1930s was accompanied by the worldwide economic panic, the political and social unrest in France, and the rise of fascism in Europe. All this could not but force French filmmakers to further face the harsh reality. During these years, René Clair, in his excellent works "Le Million" and "Sous les toits de Paris," had already used the lives of ordinary people and the slums of Paris as content and contained a critique of capitalist reality. At the same time, film masters such as Jean Renoir, Marcel Carné, and Julien Duvivier also reflected the major events in political life during this period in their works.
    At that time, it was the era when the French working class, under the leadership of Thorez, was engaged in a fierce struggle against surrendering to fascist Germany; in order to win the victory of the Popular Front, the upright French film workers, especially those united around the "Association of Revolutionary Writers and Artists" established by "l'Humanité," participated in the ranks of the struggle with their advanced film art weapons. The most meaningful film created by Jean Renoir, "La Vie est à nous," appeared at this time. When the French Communist Party participated in the election in 1936, it used this film to conduct extensive publicity among the masses, and the Popular Front won a great victory in this election.
    During the years of the fall of France, some outstanding film artists left their country, while those who remained shot excellent films such as "Les visiteurs du soir" and "Le ciel est à vous" under the dual pressure of the Vichy government and German fascism. On the other hand, progressive film workers belonging to the "National Film Front" led by the underground movement used documentary films as a weapon to encourage the humiliated French people to rise up and participate in the anti-fascist struggle. Even in the most urgent days, French film workers never relaxed their efforts to defend the national tradition and independence of film art.
    After the victory of World War II, young film artist René Clément unfolded a new page in French cinema with his realistic film "La Bataille du rail." This excellent film won an award at the first Cannes International Film Festival. At the same time, the film "Les Enfants du paradis" directed by Marcel Carné was also continuously screened in various French cities and received praise. Just as people were gratified by this situation and hoped that French cinema could achieve healthier development, under the pressure of the American government, France and the United States signed the Blum-Byrnes agreement in May 1946. This agreement stipulated that 51% of French screens be given to American films, and American films flooded into France unscrupulously. From 1947 to 1948, hundreds of dubbed and replicated American films were screened on French screens, severely hitting the French film industry, which had just taken a breather. Many studios were forced to close, and thousands of film workers could not find work. The disaster that American films brought to the French people was worse than people imagined. As Thorez pointed out at the time: "The intrusion of American films into the French film industry not only took away the bread of our studio artists, musicians, workers, and technicians, but also poisoned the souls of our children and young men and women through the power of images."
    At this critical moment, in order to maintain French national films, all upright film workers—producers, screenwriters, directors, actors, technicians—united and mobilized. They formed a powerful "French Film Defense Committee," and with the support of the vast majority of the audience, organizations of the "French Film Defense Committee" appeared in many cities. January 5, 1948, was a memorable day. On that day, a large contingent organized by the "French Film Defense Committee" held an unprecedented large-scale demonstration in the streets of Paris, showing the great strength of the French people's movement to defend national films. Under the wave of protests, the French authorities finally raised the quota for French films in film screening programs.
    Of course, this by no means means that French cinema has overcome its difficulties. The struggle against Hollywood films, and the accompanying struggle against all unreasonable measures that discriminate against national films, is continuous. The struggle launched by French film workers in 1951 to protest against a crew from Hollywood's 20th Century Fox film company coming to Paris to shoot exterior scenes for the pro-Nazi film "The Desert Fox," the fifteen-minute strike held by Paris studios on June 26, 1952, to protect French cinemas from Hollywood's aggression, the repeated demands by the French film industry to government authorities to pass a film industry subsidy bill, and the protest movement against the unreasonable film censorship system and against the establishment of a "European Film Federation" that strangled the national film industry, etc., all show the serious attitude taken by French film workers to defend their own vital interests. Excellent French films have also grown and developed in the continuous struggle and finally overcome the "gray" films that were once popular in 1948-1949 and expressed negative and disappointed emotions, becoming the mainstream of French cinema today.
    When we talk about excellent French films, the first to be mentioned are Louis Daquin's "Le Point du jour", Yves Allégret's "Manèges", and Jean-Paul Le Chanois's "Sans laisser d'adresse," which appeared earlier. "Le Point du jour" describes the life and work of miners in northern France, permeated with ardent sympathy for the working people. The protagonists of "Manèges" are ordinary people in Paris. The husband is a worker in a bookbinding shop, and the wife is a clerk in a corner store, but they are depicted as so lovely and optimistic. The artistic style of "Sans laisser d'adresse" is even more simple. It movingly depicts the fate of a provincial girl who was deceived, showing the sincere and deep feelings of the French working class and the true solidarity of ordinary people. The film brings to the audience not negative emotions but infinite hope and confidence in the future of mankind.
    Since 1952, films on the themes of people's lives and aspirations have been constantly produced. Christian-Jaque's "Fanfan la Tulipe", although it draws on a theme that has been popular in folk ballads since the eighteenth century, is not an ordinary swashbuckling legend film. The producers subtly express the people's hatred and condemnation of war instigators through the protagonist Fanfan's experience. Another film, "Forbidden Games", is an excellent anti-war work. It depicts the trauma that war leaves on people's hearts with a serious attitude. Through these films, we can see how good excellent French film artists are at using different themes to express their attitude towards the most pressing issues of the moment. Not only that, but the films that have appeared in the past four or five years, such as "The Earrings of Madame de...", "L'Air de Paris", "The Wages of Fear", "Chiens perdus sans collier", "Thérèse Raquin", "Avant le déluge", "Les Diaboliques", "Les Évadés", etc., are indeed more rich and diverse in their subject matter, and their content also profoundly expresses the French film artists' concern for some major issues directly related to people's lives. It can be said that French film workers have increasingly successfully defended their glorious national tradition. Especially after the emergence of milestone films such as "Si tous les gars du monde" and "Les Grandes Manœuvres" at the beginning of this year, we have more reason to believe that with the increasing easing of international tensions and the greater consolidation of friendship between the people of the world, the French film industry will have a brighter future in terms of artistic practice, technological progress, and business operations.
    Chinese film workers and audiences who love excellent French films will always cherish the brilliant achievements made by French film workers in the struggle to defend the national tradition and independence of their film art, and believe that the holding of this film week will further help the mutual understanding between the people of China and France.

    在斗争中前进的法国进步电影
    邢祖文
    我们还记得，法国人民曾经用那样真挚、甚至是那样炽烈的感情来欢呼中国艺术团去年在巴黎的演出；今天，我们也以同样热烈的情绪来欢迎法国电影周在中国的举行。
    法国电影不仅题材样式和表现手法是那样丰富多采，而且还强烈地表现了法国人民热爱生活、热爱和平的愿望。正是因为这样，法国电影获得了崇高的国际声誉，获得了生活在不同社会制度里的千百万观众的喜爱。从1945年到1956年，法国电影在卡罗维·发利、戛纳、威尼斯三个代表性的国际电影节上获得了六十个以上的大小奖额。例如这次电影周上映的几部影片中，“没有留下地址”得过1951年卡罗维·发利国际电影节的导演奖，“勇士的奇遇”在1952年戛纳电影节上得过奖，“禁止的游戏”则获得了1952年威尼斯电影节的国际大奖。
    作为电影开拓者的法国电影事业，虽然有了六十一年悠久的历史，虽然它每年平均要拍摄一百部以上的艺术长片；但是，它所经历的道路却是崎岖的，不平凡的。法国卓越的电影工作者，无论是老的一辈或青年一代，都曾以他们最顽强的意志和巨大的才能，为了维护电影艺术的民族传统和独立，作过坚持不渝的斗争。也正是依靠他们，以及团结在他们周围的广大群众，才克服了种种困难，取得了今天的成就。
    大家知道，电影的诞生，是一个国际性研究的结果，但大家也公认，法国在发明电影和向全世界传播电影这一点上，起过决定性的作用。包括“工厂的大门”在内的第一批活动电影是法国人卢米埃尔兄弟拍摄的，卢米埃尔兄弟后来自己开设影片公司，拍摄了不少滑稽片和短片，还派人在全世界推销影片、放映影片和拍摄影片。另一位法国电影界老前辈乔治·梅里爱在1897年创建了世界上最早的摄影棚，给全世界带来了故事片样式，把电影引向演剧的方向，并且第一次创用了特技摄影。另外，在差不多同时，法国电影还出现了像麦克斯·林戴那样伟大的电影喜剧演员。林戴演出的一系列喜剧片已不是纯粹的胡闹剧，他的表演善于细致地体现各种人物的感情，引起人们的深思，给后来的喜剧大师卓别林以深刻的影响。所有这些法国电影早期的功绩，对当时这门新兴的艺术起了奠基的作用。
    第一次世界大战爆发前，法国百代公司已把电影变成一种巨大的企业，积极向全世界推销影片。可是大战期间，美国影片却以其有利的因素开始夺取了法国影片的世界市场，甚至法国本土也充斥了好莱坞影片。大战结束后，法国影片的发展起了变化。电影艺术家和观众要求在电影的技巧和样式上突破常规，这样，在法国电影界就先后出现了印象派和先锋派的电影。
    印象派电影出现于1920年到1923年间。它的特点是注意画面的构图和气氛的烘托。属于这一流派的电影大师德吕克曾在他自己创办的法国最初的电影刊物“电影杂志”的扉页上这样写着：“法国电影应该是电影，法国电影应该是法国的”。这两句话代表了当时具有革新思想的电影艺术家要求电影成为一种独立的艺术的愿望。
    稍后的先锋派电影，在追求电影技巧方面作了进一步的探讨、努力和刻苦钻研。雷纳·克莱尔、让·雷诺阿等几位当代的电影大师和巨匠，都曾经是先锋派的健将；在1927年以后，先锋派电影受到苏联影片“战舰波将金号”和“母亲”的影响，在制作态度上已有所不同。例如青年导演让·维果在1929年拍摄的影片“尼斯城志”，已能用讽刺和批判的手法，把当时上层社会的无望生活和这个古老城市的贫困景象作了尖锐的对照。
    随着三十年代有声片到来的是全世界的经济大恐慌、法国政治和社会生活的动荡不安，以及法西斯主义在欧洲的抬头。这一切不能不使法国电影工作者进一步面对严酷的现实。这几年中，雷纳·克莱尔在他优秀的作品“百万金”和“巴黎屋檐下”里已经用普通人民和巴黎贫民区的生活作为内容，并且含有对资本主义现实的批判。同时，让·雷诺阿、马·卡尔内、让·杜维威尔这些电影大师也都在他们的作品里反映了这一时期政治生活中的巨大事件。
    当时，正是法国工人阶级在多列士领导下为反对向法西斯德国屈从而进行火热的斗争的年代；为了争取人民阵线的胜利，法国的正直电影工作者，特别是团结在“人道报”建立的“革命作家和艺术家协会”周围的电影工作者，都以他们先进的电影艺术武器，参加了斗争的行列。让·雷诺阿创作的最有意义的影片“生活是属于我们的”就是在这个时候出现的。法国共产党在1936年参加竞选时曾拿这部影片向群众进行了广泛的宣传，在这次竞选中人民阵线获得了伟大的胜利。
    在法国沦陷的年代里，某些优秀的电影艺术家离开了祖国，而留下来的却在维希政府和德国法西斯的双重重压下，拍摄了像“我们青年人”、“夏天世界”那样优秀的影片。另一方面，属于地下运动领导的“民族电影战线”的进步电影工作者则用纪录影片这一武器，鼓舞了含羞忍辱的法国人民起来参加反法西斯的斗争。即使在最紧迫的日子里，法国电影工作者也一刻不放松地捍卫了电影艺术的民族传统和独立。
    第二次世界大战胜利结束后，青年电影艺术家雷纳·克雷蒙以他的现实主义的影片“铁路的战斗”展开了法国电影新的一页。这部优秀的影片在第一届戛纳国际电影节上获得了奖。同时，马·卡尔内导演的影片“三层楼包厢的孩子们”也在法国各城市连续上映获得好评。正当人们为这种情况感到欣慰，并且希望法国电影能够得到更健全的发展的时候，在美国政府的压力下，1946年5月法国和美国签订了布鲁姆—贝尔纳斯协定。这个协定规定把法国银幕的51％让给美国电影，美国影片就这样肆无忌惮地涌进了法国。从1947到1948年，法国银幕上放映了数百部配音复制的美国影片，严重地打击了刚刚透了一口气的法国电影事业。不少摄影场被迫关了门，成千的电影工作者找不到工作。美国影片带给法国人民的灾害比人们想像的更坏，正如当时多列士指出的：“美国影片侵入法国电影界，不仅夺去了我们制片厂的艺术家、音乐家、工人和技术人员的面包，而且也通过形象的力量毒害了我们儿童和男女青年的魂灵。”
    在这危急的时刻里，为了维护法国民族电影，所有正直的电影工作者——制片家、剧作家、导演、演员、技师——都团结和动员起来了，他们组成了声势浩大的“法国电影保卫委员会”，并且在绝大部分观众的支持下，许多城市都出现了
  “法国电影保卫委员会”的组织。1948年1月5日是一个令人难忘的日子，在那一天，由“法国电影保卫委员会”组织的一支庞大队伍在巴黎街头举行了前所未有的大游行，显示了法国人民保卫民族电影运动的巨大力量。在抗议的浪潮下，法国当局终于提高了法国影片在影片上映节目上的限额。
    当然，这绝不能说法国电影已度过了难关。反对好莱坞影片的斗争，以及随之而来的反对一切歧视民族电影的不合理措施的斗争，是连续不断地在进行着的。1951年法国电影工作者为了抗议好莱坞二十世纪福斯影片公司一个摄制组到巴黎来拍摄亲纳粹影片“沙漠狐狸”外景而展开的斗争，1952年6月26日巴黎的制片厂为了保障法国电影院免受好莱坞侵略而举行的十五分钟的罢工，法国电影界向政府当局一再提出通过电影事业补贴法案的要求，以及反对不合理的电影检查制度和反对建立扼杀民族电影事业的“欧洲电影总会”的抗议运动等等，都显示了法国电影工作者为保卫自己切身事业所采取的严正态度。优秀的法国影片也正是在不断的斗争中成长起来，获得发展，并且终于战胜了一度流行于1948——1949年的表现消极和失望情绪的“灰色”影片，而成为今天法国电影的主流。
    当我们谈到优秀的法国影片时，首先要提到的是路易·达更的“曙光”、约·贝克的“安东尼夫妇”和勒·夏诺阿的“没有留下地址”这些较早出现的影片。“曙光”描述的是法国北部矿工的生活和劳动，贯串着对劳动人民的热烈同情。“安东尼夫妇”的主角是巴黎的普通人，丈夫是书籍装订所的工人，妻子是一角商店的小职员，但是他们被描绘得如此可爱和乐观。“没有留下地址”的艺术风格显得更加朴素，它动人地描写了一个被骗的外省姑娘的命运，表现了法国工人阶级的真挚深厚的感情以及普通人的真正团结的力量。影片带给观众的不是消极的情绪而是对人类的未来的无限希望和信心。
    从1952年开始，表现人民的生活和愿望的题材的影片，不断地摄制出来。克利斯兴·约克导演的“勇士的奇遇”，虽然是从十八世纪早就流行的民间歌谣中汲取的题材，但它并不是一部普通的豪侠剑客式的传奇影片，制作者通过主角芳芳的遭遇，含蓄地表现了人民对战争策动者的痛恨和谴责。另一部影片“禁止的游戏”是一部优秀的反战作品，它以严峻的态度描写了战争留给人们心灵上的创伤。通过这些影片，我们可以看出优秀的法国电影艺术家是多么善于利用不同的题材来表示他们对当前人们最迫切的问题的态度。不仅如此，最近四、五年来出现的影片，像“三妇人”、“巴黎的空气”、“恐惧的代价”、“没有脖圈的野狗”、“梯丽莎·拉更”、“洪水之前”、“青苗”、“逃亡者”等，在取材上固然更加丰富多采，在内容上也深刻地表现了法国电影艺术家对直接涉及人民生活的一些重大问题的关怀。可以这样说，法国电影工作者已愈来愈成功地捍卫了自己光荣的民族传统，特别是在今年年初出现了像“四海之内皆兄弟”和“中坚力量”那样具有里程碑意义的影片之后，使我们更有理由相信，随着国际紧张局势的日趋缓和与全世界人民友谊的更加巩固，法国电影事业不论在艺术实践、技术进展和业务经营上，都将有着更加光明的远景。
    热爱法国优秀影片的中国电影工作者和观众们，将永远珍视法国电影工作者在捍卫自己电影艺术的民族传统和独立的斗争中取得的辉煌成就，并且相信，通过这次电影周的举行，将更有助于中、法两国人民的相互了解。
