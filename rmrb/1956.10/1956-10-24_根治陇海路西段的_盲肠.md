Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 20th - The work to eradicate the "blind gut" of the western section of the Longhai Railway has been launched on a large scale. At more than two hundred construction sites along the section from Baoji to Tianshui, backed by mountains and facing rivers, over ten thousand workers are busily rebuilding tunnels and bridges. Workers wearing safety belts are brushing off sliding sand and gravel from the frequently collapsing steep slopes, preparing to construct a number of flood control projects on both sides of the roadbed.

The adverse geological conditions along this section of the railway are rare in China's railway engineering, making the eradication work arduous and complex. In just one hundred and fifty-four kilometers from Baoji to Tianshui, there are more than one hundred and thirty tunnels to be rebuilt or newly built, and more than one hundred and sixty large and small bridges and culverts must be renovated. In addition, more than two million cubic meters of earth and stone must be excavated.

Before liberation, the Baoji-Tianshui section of the railway was a "blind gut" and practically impassable. Although trains could pass after several years of repairs since liberation, landslides still occurred frequently along the line, and the transportation capacity was very low. After the ongoing eradication work is completed, it will be smooth and unimpeded, and the railway transportation capacity will be approximately doubled compared to the present.

### 根治陇海路西段的“盲肠”

    根治陇海路西段的“盲肠”
    新华社兰州20日电　根治陇海铁路西段“盲肠”的工作已经大规模展开。从宝鸡至天水背山靠河的二百多个工点上，一万多工人正在紧张地重修隧道和桥梁。套着安全带的工人，正在把经常坍方的陡坡上的滑动砂石刷落下来，准备在路基两旁修筑一批防洪工程。
    这段铁路沿线地质情况的恶劣，是我国铁路工程中罕有的，根治工作艰巨复杂。从宝鸡到天水仅一百五十四公里，需要改建和新建的隧道，有一百三十多座；必须进行改造的大小桥涵，有一百六十座以上。此外，还要开挖二百万立方公尺以上的土石方。
    宝鸡天水段铁路，解放以前是一段“盲肠”，实际上不能通车，经过解放以后几年来的整修，虽然能通行火车，但是沿线仍然不时发生坍方，运输能力很低。目前正在进行的根治工作结束以后，就能畅通无阻，铁路运输能力将比现在提高一倍左右。
