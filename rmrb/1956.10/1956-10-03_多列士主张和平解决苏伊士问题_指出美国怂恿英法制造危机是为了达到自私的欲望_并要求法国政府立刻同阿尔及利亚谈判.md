Xinhua News Agency, Paris, October 2nd: According to TASS, Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, delivered a speech at the Joliot-Curie school in Villejuif, near Paris, criticizing the French government's attitude towards the Suez Canal issue and its Algerian policy.

	Thorez pointed out that the conspiracy of the US imperialists, who were encouraging Britain and France to escalate the conflict with Egypt, was aimed at achieving their selfish desires. American monopoly capitalist groups were attempting to use the so-called Suez Canal crisis to create a "petroleum shortage" in Western Europe. French and British capitalists were wrong to think that they could maintain their interests in the Near East with the so-called aid from the United States. The way the United States ousted French colonialists in South Vietnam demonstrated that the United States was trying to squeeze out its weakened competitors everywhere in order to replace them.

	Thorez said that the French workers and the entire democratic public opinion demanded a peaceful solution to the Suez Canal issue, taking into account Egypt's legitimate rights, national sovereignty, and the interests of other countries.

	Thorez condemned the leadership of the French Socialist Party for taking a position on the Suez Canal issue that contradicted the demands of socialist parties in other countries and world democratic public opinion. He pointed out that, in fact, a united front of the international workers' movement had already been formed in the struggle for peace, but the leaders of the French Socialist Party were standing outside this front.

	Thorez also pointed out that the policy implemented by the French government, led by the Socialist Party, in Algeria directly contradicted the Socialist Party's campaign promises and the resolutions of the Socialist Party congress not long ago. He said that the French people demanded that the government immediately begin negotiations with the plenipotentiary representatives of the Algerian people, including those against whom the French authorities were currently waging war. Doing so would be in France's interest, because the war was causing enormous losses to France's economy, finances, and international prestige, and was sacrificing the lives of the French people, especially the youth. Only by making the French and Algerians friends could these difficulties be overcome.

	Thorez finally called on socialist workers and communists to strengthen united action.

    多列士主张和平解决苏伊士问题
    指出美国怂恿英法制造危机是为了达到自私的欲望
    并要求法国政府立刻同阿尔及利亚谈判
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社巴黎1日讯：法国共产党中央委员会总书记多列士在巴黎近郊维尔尤夫的约里奥—居里学校发表演说，抨击法国政府对苏伊士运河问题的态度和阿尔及利亚政策。
    多列士指出，怂恿英国和法国同埃及冲突尖锐化的美帝国主义者的阴谋是要达到他们自私的欲望。美国垄断资本集团企图利用所谓苏伊士运河危机来制造西欧的“石油荒”。法国和英国的资本家以为靠美国的所谓援助就能保持他们在近东的利益，他们想错了。美国在南越排挤法国殖民主义者的方法，说明了美国到处想挤掉它的已经被削弱了的竞争者，以便取而代之。
    多列士说，法国的工人和整个民主舆论都要求在考虑埃及的合法权利、国家主权和其他国家的利益的情况下，用和平方法来解决苏伊士运河问题。
    多列士谴责法国社会党的领导机构在苏伊士运河问题上的立场同其他国家的社会党和世界民主舆论的要求背道而驰。他指出，实际上，在争取和平的斗争中已经形成了一种国际工人运动的统一阵线，然而法国社会党的领导人却置身于这个阵线之外。
    多列士还指出，以社会党为首的法国政府在阿尔及利亚实行的政策，是同社会党的竞选诺言以及不久以前社会党代表大会的决议直接抵触的。他说，法国人民要求政府同阿尔及利亚人民的全权代表，包括法国当局现在正在对他们进行战争的那些人，立刻开始谈判。这样做是符合法国的利益的，因为战争使法国的经济、财政、国际威信都遭受巨大的损失，并且使法国人民，首先是青年，牺牲生命。而只有使法国人和阿尔及利亚人成为朋友，才能克服这些困难。
    多列士最后号召社会党的劳动者和共产党员加强一致行动。
