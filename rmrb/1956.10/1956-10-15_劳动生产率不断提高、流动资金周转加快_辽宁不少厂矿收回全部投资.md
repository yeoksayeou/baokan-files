Continuous Improvement in Labor Productivity and Accelerated Turnover of Working Capital
Many Factories and Mines in Liaoning Recover All Investment
According to Liaoning Daily: In the first three years and nine months of the first Five-Year Plan, 59 large state-owned industrial factories and mines in Liaoning Province have recovered all the state's investment in these enterprises (including existing fixed assets and working capital). These factories and mines include four oil refineries, seven metallurgical plants and mines, nine machinery factories and electrical appliance factories, eight building materials factories, twelve chemical factories, nine textile factories, four paper mills, and two cigarette factories.
In the past three years, these factories and mines have turned over to the state profits equivalent to more than 60% of all accumulation. Among them, light industrial factories have the highest profit turnover rate.
The speed at which heavy industrial factories recover state investment is also very fast. From 1953 to the end of August this year, the total investment recovered by Anshan Iron and Steel Company could build twenty modern machine tool factories of the same scale as the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant. Qingchengzi Lead Mine recovered all its investment in just one year due to the full utilization and development of the potential of its original equipment.
The remarkable success of the recovery of state investment is mainly due to the continuous improvement of labor productivity and the acceleration of working capital turnover. At present, the working capital of general light industrial factories can turn over five to six times a year, and that of general heavy industrial factories can turn over one to two times, providing extremely favorable conditions for accelerating the production cycle.

    劳动生产率不断提高、流动资金周转加快
    辽宁不少厂矿收回全部投资
    据辽宁日报讯　辽宁省国营工业在第一个五年计划头三年九个月里，已有五十九个大型厂矿收回了国家对这些企业的全部投资（包括原有的固定资产和流动资金等）。这些厂矿包括四个石油厂，七个冶金工厂和冶金矿，九个机械工厂和电器制造厂，八个建筑材料厂，十二个化学工厂，九个纺织工厂，四个造纸厂和两个卷烟厂。
    这些厂矿三年多为国家上缴的利润，相当于全部积累的60％以上。其中，轻工业工厂的利润上缴率最大。
    重工业工厂回收国家投资的速度也是很快的。鞍山钢铁公司从1953年到今年8月末回收的投资总额，可以建设起沈阳第一机床厂这样规模的现代化机床厂二十座。青城子铅矿由于充分地利用和发挥了原有设备的潜力，仅在一年内就收回了全部投资。
    国家投资的回收工作所以卓有成效，主要是由于劳动生产率的不断提高和流动资金周转加快的结果。目前一般轻工业工厂的流动资金每年可周转五次到六次，一般重工业工厂周转一次到两次，为加快生产周期提供了极有利的条件。
