　　The historically significant documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China emphatically mentioned the problems of subjectivism and sectarianism. In order to effectively and gradually eliminate the evils of subjectivism and sectarianism, we believe it is necessary to talk about the attitude towards dissenting opinions.

　　Expanding intra-party democracy is one of the important methods to make the Party's leadership work conform to objective reality. The new Party Constitution adopted by the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China fully embodies the spirit of expanding intra-party democracy in its various provisions regarding the rights of members and democratic centralism of the Party. The new Party Constitution stipulates that members have the right to participate in free and practical discussions on the theory and practical problems of the Party's policies at Party meetings or in the Party's newspapers and periodicals; members can make suggestions on work and criticize any organization and any staff member of the Party at Party meetings; if a member disagrees with a Party resolution, in addition to unconditionally implementing it, the member can reserve and submit his own opinions to the Party's leading organs, and lower-level organizations can request higher-level organizations to change the resolution. The resolution of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China on the political report also pointed out: It is necessary to "be good at listening to different opinions from the same level and from lower levels, be good at organizing free and practical discussions on policy issues at Party meetings and in Party newspapers and periodicals, allow a minority of people to reserve their opinions within the limits permitted by discipline, and allow lower levels to raise objections to higher levels. Only in this way can we have a lively Party life, and our leadership will not make mistakes that cannot be corrected in time. The method of being divorced from the masses, divorced from the collective, unable to listen to dissenting opinions, and maintaining leadership prestige by mechanical obedience can only hinder the development of our cause."

　　For many leading organs and responsible persons of Party organizations, it is relatively easy to value the opinions they consider correct and the opinions of the majority; it is not so easy to value dissenting opinions and the opinions of the minority that they consider incorrect. Some leading organs and responsible persons of Party organizations often do not consciously organize and enlighten various different opinions to carry out full discussions in the process of discussing problems and formulating resolutions, and do not consciously give the minority of people holding different opinions a full opportunity to state their views, but often use the opinions of the leaders to easily negate dissenting opinions and the opinions of the minority, and even use rude attitudes to suppress comrades who insist on dissenting opinions. This practice is contrary to the spirit of expanding intra-party democracy emphasized in the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Party.

　　Some leading cadres do not value dissenting opinions or even allow the expression of dissenting opinions because they have not truly realized the benefits of doing so, and they still believe that doing so will have many disadvantages. They have forgotten that without the free discussion of different opinions, there can be no collective leadership.

　　Some comrades are afraid that disputes will cause ideological inconsistency within the Party. This concern is actually unnecessary. For the problems that are about to be solved, everyone needs to have a consistent understanding. However, where does a consistent understanding come from? Each person's work position, experience, knowledge, ideological and political level, and the information they have on the problem to be solved are all different. Although the secretary of the Party committee is generally more politically mature, this does not guarantee that his opinions are always correct; in fact, there will never be anyone whose opinions are always correct. The more politically mature a leader is, the more he should understand the necessity of pooling the wisdom of the masses, and the more he should understand the benefits of maintaining a humble and prudent attitude and the harm of being arrogant and complacent. Moreover, even if the secretary of the Party committee's opinion on a certain issue is completely correct, his opinion will still not work if it is not agreed to by a majority of the committee members; if he tries to force it, the work will still suffer losses. Moreover, any individual's opinion is inevitably incomplete, right? Therefore, as a leader, one cannot imagine things so simply and demand that everyone's understanding be completely consistent from the beginning. Smart leaders should, as Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his political report, "allow unrestrained debate on different viewpoints in order to reflect more comprehensively the various opinions of the masses inside and outside the Party, that is, to reflect more comprehensively the various aspects of the development process of objective things." Only in this way, by presenting different situations and different viewpoints, launching debates, letting the correct ones persuade the incorrect ones, and letting the incomplete ones be supplemented and corrected, can we obtain a more comprehensive understanding that is more in line with objective reality. If the leader insists on forcing the majority to obey with the opinions of individuals or a minority of people, it will be difficult to draw comprehensive opinions that conform to objective reality, and it will be difficult to truly unify ideological understanding. In this way, differences of opinion in the work will not only not be reduced or lessened in the end, but will inevitably increase and intensify.

　　In the process of free discussion of different opinions, it is first necessary to value the opinions of the majority, because the opinions of the majority are generally more correct and more comprehensive. However, it is also necessary to appropriately value the opinions of the minority, and it is also necessary to allow the opinions of the minority to be expressed as freely as possible and to be given serious consideration. Why? First, the opinions of the majority are not correct in all cases. Sometimes, the opinions of the minority may also be correct. When the Changli County Committee of Hebei Province discussed this year's agricultural production increase target, most of the county committee members advocated increasing the yield per mu to 600 jin (more than 100% of last year's yield), and only individual comrades disagreed with this target. The county committee repeatedly considered the opinions of the minority, and also studied typical survey data, and finally negated the original opinions of the majority of the committee members, and determined the production increase target as 350 jin according to the opinions of the original minority committee members. Subsequent facts proved that this target was in line with reality. It can be seen that seriously treating the dissenting opinions of the minority can enable the Party to avoid mistakes in some cases. Second, although the opinions of the minority are mostly incomplete or incorrect, these opinions are also beneficial to the Party. Correct opinions can be developed more carefully and perfectly, with more sufficient basis, and with less one-sidedness in the process of arguing with incorrect opinions, and at the same time, more difficulties and obstacles that may be encountered in the process of realizing these propositions can be foreseen. Especially when everyone is concentrating their efforts on opposing a certain tendency, some comrades' minds are easily heated up. At this time, if a minority of people put forward some different opinions from the opposite side, it is especially important for us to prevent deviations and reduce mistakes. As the saying goes: "True gold fears no fire." Correct opinions are never afraid of being refuted by others. As long as the opinion is correct, it is easier to be accepted after debate. Only wrong opinions are afraid of debate, because debate will expose their weaknesses.

　　Not only should free debate of different viewpoints be allowed in the discussion process of formulating resolutions; even after the resolution is formulated, the Party also allows individual members to reserve and submit their own dissenting opinions to higher-level organizations, and allows lower-level organizations to raise objections to higher-level organizations. The reason why the Party treats dissenting opinions with such a high degree of democratic spirit is to make it easier for the Party to avoid mistakes. This point was well explained in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report on the revision of the Party Constitution. He pointed out: "As long as the Party's resolutions are correct, and these members who hold different opinions are willing to submit to the truth, they will eventually recognize the Party's correctness and their own mistakes with sincerity. If the truth is finally proven to be on the side of the minority, then protecting the right of the minority can also make it easier for the Party to recognize the truth." Of course, the dissenting opinions of Party members and lower-level Party organizations on the Party's resolutions must be within the scope permitted by the Party's discipline, that is to say, members who reserve their opinions must still implement the Party's resolutions; his opinions must be submitted in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Party Constitution, and it is not allowed to publicize them outside the Party; and for the lower-level organizations that request the higher-level organizations to modify the resolution, when the higher-level Party organization believes that the original resolution should still be implemented, the lower-level organization must unconditionally implement it. The Party allows different opinions to be raised, but it never allows the Party's resolutions to be executed without authorization. Otherwise, the consistency of the Party's actions cannot be guaranteed.

　　Here, we should also talk about the attitude towards comrades who raise dissenting opinions. If the dissenting opinion is wrong, the Party organization and its负责人 should patiently persuade and educate the comrades who hold these opinions. It is wrong to treat wrong opinions with a liberal attitude, and right and wrong should be clearly distinguished. However, as long as the comrades who raise dissenting opinions have not violated Party discipline, they should not be threatened with discipline or "punished"; if so, it is not the comrades who raise dissenting opinions who violate discipline, but the people who abuse their authority to infringe upon the rights of Party members. For comrades who normally raise different opinions on the Party's daily work, they should still work together in harmony and intimacy, and there should be no discrimination, exclusion, or even attacks. We have already said that comrades who raise different opinions or even insist on different opinions are not necessarily wrong; and even if the opinions of the comrades below are wrong, they should not be treated with this attitude. If Party members and lower-level organizations are required to only raise correct opinions, that is essentially suppressing democracy, that is, not allowing everyone to raise opinions, because few people dare to say that the opinions they raise that are different from those of the higher levels are necessarily correct.

　　Some leaders do not like cadres who have independent opinions, and think that they are not strong in organization and discipline, and are not easy to lead. This is not correct. They regard those who are obsequious in front of their superiors, who speak and act according to the faces of the leaders, who echo others, who never insist on their own opinions, and who never even publicly express their views, as people who are "strong" in organization and discipline. This is of course a distortion of the Party's principles. The Communist Party has always advocated independent thinking. Only through independent thinking can we truly understand the cause we are engaged in and the responsibilities we bear, and carry out our work with a high degree of consciousness. On the contrary, if you clearly disagree but insist on expressing agreement, if you clearly have opinions but pretend not to have opinions, or if you do not think about other people's opinions and blindly follow them regardless of whether they are right or wrong, this has nothing in common with the organization and discipline required by our Party. If a leader "cultivates" all the cadres he leads into such mediocrities, it is absolutely impossible to do a good job in the work he leads. Excellent leaders should actively cultivate the ability and habit of independent thinking among their staff, as well as the courage to uphold the truth. Because only such staff can effectively fight for the realization of the Party's propositions and the adherence to the Party's principles.

　　There are also a very few leaders who are afraid of disputes and afraid of different opinions because they value their personal "dignity" more than the interests of the Party's cause. They are afraid that raising different opinions will make them seem not smart enough. Some people even demand that others treat their opinions with the attitude of "the master is always right," and whoever raises different opinions to them, they say that whoever does not respect the leadership, destroys the leadership's "prestige," and then use rude attitudes and means that violate the Party Constitution to attack them. They do not know that the prestige of the leader can only be the result of correct leadership. If you refuse to listen to the opinions of the masses, if you suppress the correct opinions of the masses, there can be no correct leadership, and there can be no "prestige." Any false prestige built on sand will eventually collapse.

　　There is no doubt that the Party's request to expand intra-party democracy and to require leaders to correctly treat dissenting opinions does not mean that the debate on matters of principle can be turned into unprincipled quarrels, and the discussion of work issues can be turned into endless chatter. However, there is also no doubt that the way to prevent this bias is not to prohibit legitimate discussions of different opinions, not to suppress dissenting opinions, but to strengthen the leadership of intra-party discussions. How can it be said to be the correct leadership that the Party needs to stop eating because of choking?

### 不要害怕反对的意见

专栏：社论

　　不要害怕反对的意见
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的具有历史意义的文献，强调地提到了反对主观主义和宗派主义的问题。为了有效地逐步消除主观主义和宗派主义的弊害，我们认为有必要谈一下对待反对意见的态度问题。
    扩大党内民主是使党的领导工作符合于客观实际的重要方法之一。党的第八次全国代表大会通过的新党章，关于党员的权利和党的民主集中制的各项规定，都充分地体现了扩大党内民主的精神。新党章规定，党员有权在党的会议上或者在党的报刊上参加关于党的政策的理论和实际问题的自由的、切实的讨论；党员可以对工作提出建议，在党的会议上批评党的任何组织和任何工作人员；对于党的决议如果有不同意的地方，除了无条件地执行以外，党员可以保留和向党的领导机关提出自己的意见，下级组织可以请求上级组织改变决议。中国共产党第八次全国代表大会关于政治报告的决议也指出：要“善于听取同级的和下级的不同意见，善于在党的会议上和党的报刊上组织关于政策问题的自由、切实的讨论，在纪律许可的范围内允许少数人保留自己的意见，允许下级向上级提出异议。只有这样，我们才能有生动活泼的党的生活，我们的领导才不致犯了错误而不能及时地改正。那种脱离群众、脱离集体、听不得反对意见、用机械的服从来维持领导威信的办法，只能妨害我们的事业的发展。”
    对于我们许多党的领导机关和党组织的负责人来说，重视自己认为是正确的意见和多数人的意见是比较容易做到的；重视自己认为是不正确的反对意见和少数人的意见，就不那么容易了。有些党的领导机关和党组织的负责人，在讨论问题制定决议的过程中，常常不是有意识地组织、启发各种不同意见展开充分的讨论，不是有意识地使持有不同意见的少数人有充分申述自己主张的机会，而常常是用领导者的意见去轻易否定反对意见和少数人的意见，甚至用粗暴的态度去压制坚持反对意见的同志。这种作法和党的第八次代表大会的文献所强调的扩大党内民主的精神是相违背的。
    有些领导工作人员所以不重视反对意见甚至不允许发表反对意见，是因为他们没有真正体会到这样做的好处，他们还认为这样做会有很多害处。他们忘记了，没有不同意见的自由讨论，就不可能有什么集体领导。
    有些同志害怕争论会引起党内思想的不一致。这种顾虑其实是不必要的。对于即将着手解决的问题，需要大家有一致的认识。但是，一致的认识从何而来？每一个人的工作岗位、经历、经验、思想政治水平，以及对要解决的问题所掌握的情况都有不同的地方。党委的书记虽然一般地在政治上是比较成熟的，但是这并不能保证他的意见经常正确；实际上，意见永远正确的人是永远也不会有的。领导者在政治上愈是成熟，就应该愈懂得集思广益的必要，就应该愈懂得保持谦虚谨慎态度的利益和骄傲自满、自以为是的危害。而且，即使党委的书记对某一个问题的意见是完全正确的，如果不得到多数委员的同意，他的意见仍然是行不通的；如果勉强去行，工作也还是会受到损失。何况任何个人的意见总不免有不周到的地方呢？因此，作为一个领导者，就不能把事情设想得那么简单，要求大家的认识一开始就会完全一致。聪明的领导者，应该像刘少奇同志在政治报告中所说的那样：“容许不同观点的无拘束的争论，以便比较全面地反映党内外群众的各种意见，也就是比较全面地反映客观事物发展过程中的各个侧面。”只有这样，把不同的情况和不同的观点都提出来，展开争论，让正确的去说服错误的，让不全面的得到补充修正，而后才能求得比较符合于客观实际的比较全面的认识。如果领导者坚持用个人的意见或少数人的意见去强制多数人服从，这就很难得出符合于客观实际的全面的意见，也就很难真正统一思想认识。这样，工作中的意见分歧在最后不但不会减少减轻，而且必然加多加重。
    在不同意见进行自由讨论的过程中，首先需要重视多数的意见，因为多数的意见一般是比较正确比较全面的。但是也需要适当地重视少数的意见，也需要让少数的意见尽可能得到畅所欲言的机会，并且受到认真的考虑。为什么呢？第一，大多数人的意见并不是在任何情况下都是正确的。有时候，少数人的意见也会是正确的。河北省昌黎县委会讨论今年农业增产指标的时候，大多数县委委员主张每亩增产到六百斤（超过去年产量的百分之一百以上），只有个别同志不赞成这个指标。县委会再三考虑了少数人的意见，又研究了典型调查资料，终于否定了多数委员原来的意见，而按原来是少数委员的意见把增产指标确定为三百五十斤。以后的事实证明，这个指标是符合实际的。由此可见，认真地对待少数人的不同意见，在有些情况下可以使党避免错误。第二，少数人的意见虽然在大多数情况下是不全面的，或者是不正确的，但是，这些意见对党也有好处。正确的意见在同错误的意见争论的过程中可以发展得更加周密、完善，根据更为充分，片面性更为减少，同时还可以更多地预见到实现这些主张的过程中会遇到的一些困难和障碍。特别是当大家集中力量在反对一种倾向的时候，有些同志的脑子很容易发热，这时候，如果有少数人从反面提出一些不同的意见，对于我们防止偏差减少错误，尤其有重要的意义。俗话说：“真金不怕火炼”。正确的意见是决不怕别人反驳的，只要意见正确，经过辩论就更容易被人接受。只有错误的意见才害怕辩论，因为辩论就要暴露它们的弱点。
    不仅在制定决议的讨论过程中要允许不同观点的自由争论；就是在制定决议以后，党也还允许个别的党员保留和向上级组织提出自己的不同意见，允许下级组织向上级组织提出异议。党所以要用这样高度的民主精神来对待反对的意见，目的在于使党更容易避免错误。这一点，邓小平同志所作的关于修改党的章程的报告中作了很好的说明。他指出：“只要党的决议是正确的，这些持有不同意见的党员又是愿意服从真理的，他们终于会心悦诚服地认识党的正确和自己的错误。如果真理最后被证明是在少数方面，那么，保护少数的这种权利，也可以使党更容易地认识真理。”当然，党员和党的下级组织对党的决议提出不同意见，必须是在党的纪律许可的范围内，就是说，保留意见的党员仍然必须执行党的决议；他的意见必须按照党章所规定的程序提出，不允许向党外去宣传；而对于请求上级组织修改决议的下级组织说来，当上级党组织认为仍然应当执行原决议时，下级组织就必须无条件地执行。党允许提出不同意见，但是决不允许擅自不执行党的决议。不然，就不能保证党的行动的一致。
    这里，还应该谈到对待提出反对意见的同志的态度的问题。如果反对意见是错误的，党组织和它的负责人要对持有这些意见的同志进行耐心的说服教育。用自由主义的态度对待错误的意见是不对的，是非应该分明。但是，只要提出反对意见的同志没有违反党的纪律，就不应该用纪律去威胁他们或者“处分”他们；如果那样，犯纪律的就不是提出反对意见的同志，而是滥用威权去侵害党员权利的人了。对于在正常情况下对于党的日常工作提出不同意见的同志，应该是照常亲密无间地同他们和睦共事，决不应该有任何歧视、排斥以至打击的行为。我们已经说过，提出不同意见甚至坚持不同意见的同志不一定是错误的；而且，即使下边同志的意见是错误的，也不应该用这种态度去对待他们。如果要求党员和下级组织只能提正确意见，那实质上就是压制民主，就是不让大家提意见，因为很少有人敢说他提出的同上级不同的意见一定是正确的。
    有些领导者不大喜欢那些有独立见解的干部，认为他们组织性纪律性不强，不好领导。这是不正确的。他们把那些在上级面前唯唯诺诺，看领导者的脸色说话行事的人，那些随声附和、从不坚持意见、甚至从不公开表示自己主张的人，当作组织性纪律性“强”的人。这当然是对党的原则的一种曲解。共产党从来是提倡独立思考的。只有独立思考，才能真正认识自己所从事的事业和所担负的责任，高度自觉地进行工作。相反的，如果自己明明不同意而硬表示同意，明明有意见而硬装着没有意见，或者对别人的意见不加思考，不管对不对盲目跟着走，这同我们党所要求的组织性纪律性并没有什么共同之处。如果一个领导者把自己所领导的干部都“培养”成这样一些庸人，那就绝对不可能做好他所领导的工作。优秀的领导者应该积极培养工作人员独立思考的能力和习惯，以及坚持真理的勇气。因为只有这样的工作人员，才能够有效地为实现党的主张和坚持党的原则而斗争。
    也有极少数的领导人员害怕争论、害怕不同意见，是因为他们把个人的“尊严”看得重于党的事业的利益。他们怕别人提出不同的意见会显得自己不够高明。有些人甚至要求别人用“老爷说的准没错”的态度来对待自己的意见，谁要是对他们提出不同的意见，他们就说谁是不尊重领导，破坏领导“威信”，就用粗暴的态度和违反党章的手段来加以打击。他们不知道，领导者的威信只能是领导正确的结果。如果不肯倾听群众的意见，如果压制群众的正确意见，就不可能有正确的领导，也就不可能有什么“威信”。任何建基在沙滩上的假威信，终久是要垮台的。
    毫无疑问，党要求扩大党内民主，要求领导者正确地对待反对的意见，决不是说可以把原则问题的争论变成无原则的争吵，把对工作问题的讨论变成无休止的清谈。但是，同样没有疑问的是，防止这种偏向的办法不是禁止不同意见的正当的讨论，不是压制反对意见，而是加强对党内讨论的领导。因噎废食，怎么能说得上是党所需要的正确的领导呢？
