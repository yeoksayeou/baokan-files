　　Xinhua News Agency Dispatch by Xinhua News Agency Reporter Feng Jianshu: The rectification movement in Shanxi Province, which recently began and focuses on opposing bureaucratic work styles, is currently being deepened in close combination with current practical work.

　　Since the rectification began in early August, various localities have adopted the method of learning while checking and improving while working, integrating rectification study with current practical work. At present, cadres participating in rectification study in various counties and province-administered cities have basically finished reading the designated five documents, combined with checking the bureaucratic and subjectivist errors committed in past work. Based on the loopholes discovered during the checks, they have improved the system of collective leadership and democratic life, and have begun to improve their work styles and work systems. The Changzhi Prefectural Party Committee and the Changzhi and Yangquan Municipal Party Committees organized rectification offices. The Jinan Prefectural Party Committee and the Yanbei Prefectural Party Committee also formed investigation teams to specifically investigate and study the manifestations and root causes of bureaucratic and subjectivist work styles in leading organs and commandism and sectarianism in lower-level organizations, as well as methods for future improvement, to guide the deepening of the rectification movement.

　　In addition to checking past errors and shortcomings in conjunction with studying documents, various localities have also generally arranged various tasks in the spirit of rectification. In the recent arrangements for autumn production and autumn harvest distribution in Xieyu and Guo counties, a large number of cadres were sent out in advance to investigate the situation and study typical examples, and then an enlarged cadre meeting of the whole county was convened for discussion to determine the tasks. The tasks arranged in this way were not only in line with reality but also met the demands of the masses. The vast number of lower-level cadres were deeply aware of the importance of the tasks and actively requested to go to the countryside to work, completely avoiding the past tendency of the county party committee subjectively arranging a set of tasks and forcing cadres to carry them out. In the rectification movement, the leading organs of Wuxiang County organized more than 60,000 township, cooperative cadres, and members to conduct on-the-spot inspections and discussions on autumn crops throughout the county, finding many experiences in promoting local yield-increasing techniques based on local conditions. This resulted in increased production, as well as the experiences and lessons of the county and township leading cadres subjectively requiring the expansion of "Golden Queen" planting areas, which resulted in reduced production. Through these discussions, cadres in counties and districts across the county deeply recognized the harm of bureaucratic and subjectivist work styles. Cadres who were originally indifferent to the rectification also began to check the shortcomings in their personal work styles.

　　Recently, cadres participating in the rectification movement in various localities have continuously read the documents and related speeches of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, preparing to more deeply check and improve their work after November.

　　山西省整风运动深入展开
    据新华社讯　新华社记者冯建书报道：山西省最近开始的以反对官僚主义作风为主的整风运动，目前正密切结合当前实际工作深入展开。
    自8月初开始整风以来，各地都采取了边学习、边检查、边改进的办法，使整风学习和当前实际工作结合进行。目前，各县和省辖市参加整风学习的干部已基本上读完指定的五个文件，结合检查了过去工作中所犯的官僚主义和主观主义错误，并且根据检查中发现的漏洞，健全了集体领导和民主生活制度，开始改进了工作作风和工作制度。中共长治地委和长治、阳泉市委组织了整风办公室，中共晋南地委和雁北地委还组成调查组，专门调查研究各地领导机关的官僚主义和主观主义、下层组织的命令主义和宗派主义作风的表现形态、产生根源以及今后改进方法，指导整风运动深入开展。
    除结合学习文件检查过去错误和缺点外，各地还普遍以整风的精神布置各项工作。解虞、崞县在最近布置秋季生产和秋收分配工作中，事前派出大批干部调查情况，研究典型，然后召开全县扩大干部会进行讨论，确定任务。这样布置的任务既切合实际，又适合群众要求，广大下层干部深知任务的重要性，积极要求下乡工作，完全避免了过去县委主观布置一套，强迫干部执行的偏向。武乡县领导机关在整风运动中，曾组织了六万多乡、社干部和社员，对全县秋季作物进行实地检查和座谈，找出许多因地制宜推广当地增产技术经验，结果得到增产，和县、乡领导干部主观要求扩大“金皇后”种植面积，结果遭到减产的经验和教训。经过这些座谈，使全县县区干部深刻认识了官僚主义和主观主义作风的危害，原来对整风漠不关心的干部，也开始检查个人作风上的缺点。
    最近，各地参加整风运动的干部又连续阅读了中共第八次全国代表大会的文件和有关发言，准备到11月以后更加深入地检查和改进工作。
