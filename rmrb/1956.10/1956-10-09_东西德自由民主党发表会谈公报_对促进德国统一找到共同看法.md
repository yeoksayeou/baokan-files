Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 8th - The Berlin (Democratic Sector) Radio Station broadcast on the morning of the 7th that a delegation from the Executive Committee of the Free Democratic Party of the German Democratic Republic and a delegation from the Executive Committee of the Free Democratic Party of West Germany held talks in Weimar, German Democratic Republic from October 4th to 6th.

The communiqué issued after the talks first pointed out: Both sides recognize that the reunification of Germany can only be achieved under the condition that the entire German people should act as the primary spokespersons for their own cause, rather than entrusting the issue of reunification solely to the four occupying powers that have assumed obligations according to the Potsdam Agreement. Starting from this point, the two sides held this meeting.

The communiqué stated: "The central topic of the meeting was the peaceful reunification of Germany and the possibility of cooperation between the two parties to achieve this goal and end Germany's unfortunate division. Although there are many differences of opinion between the two parties on ideological and political foundations, they have nevertheless found a series of common views on the practical ways to promote German reunification."

The communiqué said that the meeting "also discussed the possibility of limiting the armed forces and armaments of the two parts of Germany. This limitation will greatly help to ease domestic tensions in Germany. The two sides also put forward motions and suggestions on strengthening the exchange of opinions between each other and mutual meetings between Germans. Representatives of the two parties reached an agreement to support open exchanges of opinions between the two parts of Germany on the domestic conditions for German reunification. They unanimously agreed on the need to continue the talks and report to their executive committees."

    东西德自由民主党发表会谈公报
    对促进德国统一找到共同看法
    新华社柏林8日电　柏林（民主区）广播电台7日早晨广播：民主德国自由民主党执行委员会代表团同西德自由民主党执行委员会代表团在10月4日到6日在民主德国的魏玛举行了会谈。
    会谈后发表的公报首先指出：双方认识到德国的重新统一只能在这样的情况下达成，即：全德人民应该以自己事业的首要代言人自任，而不把重新统一问题仅仅交给根据波茨坦协定而承担了义务的四个占领国。双方从这一点出发，举行了这次会谈。
    公报说：“会谈的中心议题是德国的和平统一和两党为实现这个目标以结束德国不幸的分裂而进行合作的可能性。尽管两党在意识形态和政治基础的问题上存在着很多分歧意见，但是，他们仍然对于促进德国统一的实际道路找到了一系列的共同看法。”
    公报说，这次会谈“还讨论了限制德国两个部分的武装部队和军备的可能性。这种限制将大大有助于德国国内紧张局势的缓和。双方还就加强彼此之间意见的交换和德国人之间的相互会见提出了动议和建议。两党代表达成协议，支持德国两个部分之间就德国统一的国内条件进行公开的意见交换。他们一致认为有必要继续举行会谈，并且向他们的执行委员会作报告。”
