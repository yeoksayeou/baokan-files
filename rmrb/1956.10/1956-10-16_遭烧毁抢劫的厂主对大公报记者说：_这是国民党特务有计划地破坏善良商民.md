Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 14th. Hong Kong dispatch: Zhuang Chengzong, owner of Oriental Soy Sauce Factory in Tsuen Wan, and Deng Dianchu, owner of Guangzhou Steel Window Factory in Castle Peak Road, spoke to the "Ta Kung Pao" reporter on the 12th about the burning and looting of their factories by Kuomintang secret agents and rioters.

	Zhuang Chengzong said that his soy sauce factory was burned or looted many times during the riots, indicating that the Kuomintang secret agents were deliberately sabotaging good businessmen. He said that the Tsuen Wan Oriental Soy Sauce Factory was set on fire by rioters on the evening of the 11th, burning down two raw material warehouses, one office building, three dormitories, and one bean sprouting room. A car was also burned. In addition, some large vats used for making soy sauce were smashed by rioters, resulting in significant losses. On the 12th, the Oriental Soy Sauce Factory was looted several times by rioters.

	Zhuang Chengzong said that in recent days he has received many phone calls from customers expressing their condolences, and some have even offered to provide financial support to help Oriental Soy Sauce Factory resume production if necessary. Zhuang Chengzong said that although the soy sauce factory has been severely damaged and it is very difficult to resume production, he is still trying to find ways to resume as soon as possible to supply customers.

	Deng Dianchu said that the Guangzhou Steel Window Factory has been burned down, the machinery in the factory has been damaged, the items have been looted, and the typewriters and fans in the office building have been thrown into the street by rioters. All documents were completely burned. The estimated total loss is one million Hong Kong dollars. Deng Dianchu said that before the factory was destroyed, he had called the Hong Kong British police to report the incident, but the Hong Kong British police authorities did not provide timely assistance. He believes that if the police authorities had taken measures earlier, his factory could have avoided this loss.

    遭烧毁抢劫的厂主对大公报记者说：
    这是国民党特务有计划地破坏善良商民
    新华社广州14日电　香港消息：荃湾东方酱油厂东主庄成宗、青山道广州钢窗厂东主邓典初12日就他们的工厂被国民党特务分子和暴徒烧毁抢掠一事向“大公报”记者发表谈话。
    庄成宗说，我的酱油厂在这次骚乱中多次遭到焚烧或抢劫，表明了国民党特务分子是有计划地对善良商民进行破坏。他说，荃湾东方酱油厂11日晚被暴徒放火焚烧，计烧毁了原料仓库二间，写字楼一间，宿舍三间，发豆室一间，汽车一辆，另有一部分用以酿制酱油的大缸被暴徒打烂，损失甚大。12日，东方酱油厂又被暴徒劫掠了多次。
    庄成宗说，连日来他收到不少顾客来电话慰问，有些还表示在必要时可以出钱支持东方酱油厂恢复生产。庄成宗表示，虽然酱油厂被严重破坏，恢复生产是很困难的，但仍然想办法尽早恢复，供应顾客。
    邓典初说，广州钢窗厂已被焚毁，厂内机器被破坏，物品被抢掠一空，写字楼内的打字机、风扇都被暴徒抛在街上。所有文件完全烧光。估计全部损失达港币一百万元。邓典初说，工厂被毁前，曾经用电话向香港英国警方报警，但香港英国警察当局没有及时救援。他认为如果警察当局能早些采取措施，他的工厂是可以避免此次损失的。
