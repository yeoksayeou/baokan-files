In September, in Wangcheng County, Hunan Province, over 90,000 farm households averaged 2.95 pigs per household. By the end of this year, the total number of pigs in the county could reach over 400,000, averaging one pig per person.

Currently, the county has already exceeded its January to September live pig procurement plan by 27.1%. Regulations for purchasing meat with coupons have also been abolished, and farmers can buy pork at nearby supply stations at any time.

This year, the county's income from pig farming accounts for approximately 75% of the total income from rice, with an average pig farming income of 173 yuan per farmer household. The accumulated pig manure has solved the fertilizer shortage problem for 75% of the county's paddy fields.

Wangcheng County took a detour on the issue of collective versus private pig farming. At the beginning of the year, the Wangcheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed a method of "relying on agricultural cooperatives for public raising, while also taking into account members' private raising." This method was well-suited to the adventurous mood of many agricultural cooperative cadres after the county completed its primary agricultural collectivization, who were eager for quick results and emphasized grand gestures. As a result, in less than two months, the county went from three cooperatives collectively raising over 80 pigs in January to 298 cooperatives collectively raising over 8,000 pigs. However, according to a survey in April, more than 30,000 farmer households in the county did not raise pigs. Thus, pig farming failed to develop, and losses were incurred due to the lack of experience in collective raising. For example, Yanghu Agricultural Cooperative lost more than 500 yuan after collectively raising pigs for more than two months.

In this situation, an investigative report pointed out the crux of the problem. According to a survey of the potential for pig farming in over 200 agricultural cooperative member households, about 70% of the households that did not raise pigs had labor, a certain amount of capital, and a complete set of existing pig farming equipment. Based on this situation, the County Committee proposed a method of "vigorously developing private raising by members, and gradually developing collective pig raising in cooperatives with suitable conditions" to replace the previous method. This method truly mobilized the enthusiasm of members for pig raising, and the county's pig farming industry quickly developed.

Wangcheng County adopted a "self-breeding and self-raising" method to solve the pig breed problem relatively smoothly. This year, the county widely promoted the experience of Fanshen Agricultural Cooperative, which bred 232 pigs from three sows last year. In July, after household-by-household appraisal, the county universally conducted a selection process to eliminate the weak and retain the strong, while also promoting the crossbreeding of improved breeds such as "Yorkshire" and "Soviet Large White" pigs. The county is currently carrying out a "four guarantees" campaign of protecting pregnancy, ensuring production, ensuring survival, and nurturing fattening, to improve the survival rate of piglets.

With the resolution of the pig source problem, the member's pig farming industry developed rapidly, and there was once a feeling of difficulty in the source of feed. To solve the feed problem, they also relied on local experience—planting spring buckwheat, potatoes, and cabbage in the spring; planting foreign spinach and pumpkins in the summer; planting radishes and autumn buckwheat in the autumn; and planting cowpea cabbage in the winter. As long as these crops are well cultivated and managed, generally, one point of land can produce enough green feed to raise one pig. Various agricultural cooperatives, without affecting the realization of production plans, also borrowed some autumn and winter fallow fields for members to grow green feed, which would be taken back when the cooperatives needed them. In this way, fertility can also be increased in the fields.

To enable pig farming to be widely developed, it is also necessary to provide farmers with necessary assistance from all aspects. The county has issued more than 175,000 yuan in live pig loans, and credit cooperatives have also issued a large number of pig farming loans. Agricultural cooperatives generally adopt collective raising of breeding boars and sows, and pre-allocate the piglets born to members for private raising, with members repaying the principal or in installments after the piglets are sold. Xitang Agricultural Cooperative has pre-allocated dozens of piglets to poor members. This cooperative has already achieved an average of one pig per person. Some cooperatives hand over some of the cooperative's public pigs to members for surrogate raising, with the cooperative supplying fine feed and paying according to output.

After the development of private pig raising by members, all agricultural cooperatives have paid attention to uniformly solving the problem of fine feed for pig raising by members and arranging the labor time of members. Local food companies have also improved their procurement methods, adopting the method of signing pig delivery contracts with cooperatives as units, according to the farmers' wishes and based on the reasonable time for live pigs to be slaughtered. Relevant departments also stipulated that each pig purchased by the state would sell eight jin of lard or pork to farmers, and all eight jin of meat would be exempt from slaughter tax; the salt needed for feeding pigs in agricultural cooperatives would be tax-exempt, and the price would be 4.2 yuan lower per hundred jin than the wholesale price. Live pig purchase prices were also adjusted from August 7th. By the end of August, every household in the county was raising pigs.

Since August, the grain department has also established a unit specifically responsible for feed supply, reducing the turnover costs in feed supply, so that the price of each dan of fine bran is one yuan lower than before.

In order to do a good job in epidemic prevention and hygiene, the county's health institutions have equipped each cooperative with two veterinarians. Before the outbreak of swine fever in May, all live pigs in the county were universally given three rounds of vaccinations. Subsequently, the county continuously carried out four white pigsty campaigns, with more than 80% of pig farmers washing their pigsties once or twice a month with lime water to keep the pigsties clean and white. By August, the mortality rate of pigs due to disease had dropped from 1.3% of the total number of pigs raised per month before March to 0.2%.

    望城县平均每人养了一头猪
    新华社记者　胡坚
    9月，湖南省望城县九万多农户平均每户养猪已达二点九五头。到今年年底，全县养猪总数就可以达四十多万头，平均每人有一头猪。
    现在，全县1月到9月份的生猪收购计划已经超额27.1％完成了。凭证购肉的规定也废除了，农民随时可以到附近的供应站买到猪肉。
    今年全县的养猪收入约占稻谷总收入的75％，平均每户农民养猪收入一百七十三元。所积的猪肥，解决了全县75％稻田的缺肥困难。
    望城县的养猪业在集体养还是私养的问题上，曾经走过一段弯路。中共望城县委在年初曾提出过“依靠农业社公养，兼顾社员私养”的办法。这个办法正适合全县完成初级农业合作化后，许多农业社干部贪多图大，讲究声势场面的冒进情绪。于是在不到两个月的时间内，全县就由1月份三个社集体养猪八十多头，发展到二百九十八个社集体养猪八千多头。但是，根据4月份的调查，全县有三万多户农民没有养猪。这样，养猪业没有能得到发展，并且因为集体养缺乏经验，还受了损失。如洋湖农业社集体养猪两个多月，就亏本达五百多元。
    在这种情况下，一个调查材料指出了问题的症结。根据对二百多个农业社社员家庭养猪潜在能力的调查，没有养猪的农户中有70％左右是有劳动力、有一定资金、还有整套的现成的养猪设备的农户。县委根据这个情况，提出“大力发展社员私养，在有条件的社逐步发展集体养猪”的办法，来代替以前的办法。这个办法真正发动了社员养猪的积极性，全县的养猪事业很快就得到了发展。
    养猪中的种源问题，望城县采取“自繁自养”的办法，比较顺利地解决了。今年全县普遍推广了翻身农业社去年用三头母猪繁殖二百三十二头生猪的经验。7月份经过逐户鉴定，全县又普遍进行了一次去弱留强的选种工作，同时推广了“约克夏”、“苏联大白猪”等良种猪的杂交工作。全县正在开展保胎、保产、保成活和保育肥等“四保”运动，来提高小猪的成活率。
    随着猪源问题的解决，社员养猪业发展很快，曾一度感到饲料来源的困难。解决饲料问题，他们也依靠了当地的经验——春季种春荞麦、马铃薯、白菜；夏季种洋菠菜、南瓜等；秋季种萝卜、秋荞麦；冬季种牛皮菜等。这些作物只要栽培管理得好，一般情况下，一分地可以出产够养一头猪的青饲料。各农业社在不影响实现生产计划的前提下，还借了部分秋冬休闲田给社员种青饲料，待社里需要时再收回来。这样，还可以使田里增加肥分。
    要使养猪业得到广泛发展，还必须经常从各方面给农民以必要的扶助。全县已发放生猪贷款十七万五千多元，信用合作社也发放了大量养猪贷款。农业社一般采取集体养种公猪和母猪，把生下的小猪预支给社员私养，出卖以后由社员还本或分期还款。西塘农业社已预支几十头小猪给贫困社员。这个社已经做到平均每人都养一头猪。有些社把社里一部分公有猪交给社员代养，由社里供应精饲料，按产计酬。
    在社员私人养猪发展起来以后，各农业社都注意了统一解决社员养猪的精饲料问题和安排社员的劳动时间。当地食品公司也改进了收购方法，采取以社为单位，按照农民自愿，根据生猪合理的出栏时间，签订送猪合同。有关部门还规定每头派购猪卖给农民八斤猪油或猪肉，这八斤肉全部免屠宰税；农业社喂猪所需的食盐，免税优待，每百斤比批发价格低四元二角。8月7日起又调整了生猪收购价格。到8月底，全县已是家家养猪了。
    从8月开始，粮食部门也成立了专管饲料供应的单位，减少了饲料供应中的周转费，使每担细糠价格比原来降低了一元。
    为了做好防疫卫生工作，县里卫生机构为每个社配备了两位兽医。5月间，猪疫未发生前，全县生猪就普遍进行了三次防疫注射。接着，全县连续开展了四次白猪栏运动，有80％以上的养猪户每月用石灰水洗刷一两次猪栏，使猪栏保持清洁白净。到8月份，猪的病疫死亡率已由3月份以前每月占养猪总数的1.3％下降到0.2％了。
