Xinhua News Agency, October 15th - The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, and the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade held a signing ceremony in Beijing today for the "Joint Statement on Further Promoting Sino-Japanese Trade." Representing the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade in signing the statement were Chairman Nan Hanchen, Vice Chairmen Lei Renmin, Li Zhuchen, and Committee Member Lu Xuzhang. Representing the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade were Masanosuke Ikeda, Seiichi Katsumada, Takazo Kato, and Kei Hoashi. Shozo Murata, representing the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, will sign at a later date due to illness.

Present at the signing on the Chinese side were Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, as well as Liao Chengzhi and Yang Haolu, Assistant Minister of Foreign Trade. On the Japanese side were Haruji Hosono of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and Tadaharu Kuno and Seiji Kato of the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade delegation.

Xinhua News Agency, October 15th - The full text of the Joint Statement on Further Promoting Sino-Japanese Trade by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, and the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade is as follows:

    Since the signing of the first Sino-Japanese trade agreement four years ago, trade between the two countries has grown daily thanks to the efforts of the peoples of China and Japan, which is gratifying.

    However, given the traditional historical relationship and geographical conditions between China and Japan, we feel that the current Sino-Japanese trade has not yet achieved its due development.

    In view of the success of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition currently being held in Beijing and the ardent expectations of the peoples of both countries for Sino-Japanese trade, in order to promote the continued development of trade between the two countries, both parties confirm that the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement will be extended to May 4, 1957. At the same time, both parties exchanged views on the outstanding issues in the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and other relevant issues, and reached a consensus on the following issues:

    1. Both parties agree to strive to establish non-governmental permanent commercial representative offices in each other's countries during the extension of the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

    2. Both parties are willing to further expand the volume of trade according to needs and possibilities, and when necessary, individual adjustments can be made to the commodities listed in the appendix according to the commodity classification principles of the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

    3. Both parties agree that before the national banks of both countries sign a payment agreement, the foreign exchange banks of the two countries should first, in the short term, specifically negotiate the establishment of direct business relations.

    4. Both parties agree that efforts should be made to strengthen technical exchanges and cooperation between the two countries.

    5. Both parties agree to work hard to promote the early signing of a trade agreement between the governments of the two countries in order to normalize trade relations between the two countries.

    新华社15日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会同日本国际贸易促进协会和日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟关于进一步促进中日贸易的共同声明，全文如下：
    自从双方签订第一次中日贸易协议以来，已经四年，在此期间，由于中日两国人民的努力，两国的贸易日有增长，这是值得欣庆的。
    但是，从中日两国的传统历史关系和地理条件来说，我们感到目前的中日贸易还是没有得到应有的发展。
    鉴于这次在北京举办的日本商品展览会的成功以及两国人民对中日贸易的热切期待，为了促进两国的贸易继续发展，双方确认第三次中日贸易协定延长到1957年5月4日。同时，双方就中日第三次贸易协定中尚待实现的各项问题和其他有关问题交换了意见，并就下列问题取得了一致的意见：
    1、双方同意，在第三次中日贸易协定延长期间努力实现互设民间性的常驻商务代表机构。
    2、双方愿意根据需要与可能进一步扩大贸易额，并在必要时，可根据第三次中日贸易协定的商品分类原则，对附表所列商品进行个别调整。
    3、双方同意，在双方国家银行签订支付协定以前，先由两国外汇银行，在短期内，具体商洽建立直接业务关系。
    4、双方同意，应努力加强两国间的技术交流和合作。
    5、双方同意，为实现两国贸易关系正常化，努力促进早日签订两国政府间的贸易协定。
