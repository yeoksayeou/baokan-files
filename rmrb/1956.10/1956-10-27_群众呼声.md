    A Public Document with a Mismatched Title
    On September 18th, the Jingzhou Prefecture Water Conservancy Bureau received a public document from the Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Department. The title of the document was "Notice on Doing a Good Job in Soil and Water Conservation Work," but the content was a copy of the "Supplementary Regulations on Arranging the Collection of Water Fees in Irrigation Areas" from the Hubei Provincial People's Committee. Several comrades in the bureau who urgently needed to understand the leadership's instructions on soil and water conservation work were holding this public document that was completely irrelevant, not knowing what to do.

    A Word to Organizations that Randomly Poach Drivers
    Recently, units such as the Ministry of Light Industry, China International Travel Service, and the Qianmen Hotel have been using higher wages and personal connections to entice drivers from our company to resign. As a result, the Labor and Wage Department of our company is flooded with people requesting to resign, seriously affecting our current transportation work.

    We suggest to the units that lack drivers: If you need our company to assist in solving your difficulties, you can request the Beijing Labor Bureau or the Beijing Automobile Transportation Company to make unified arrangements. Please do not poach people in secret to avoid affecting our work.

    题文不符的公文
    9月18日，荆州专署水利局收到湖北省水利厅寄来一份公文，这份公文的题目是，“为作好水土保持工作的通知”，但是，内容却是，抄转湖北省人民委员会的“关于布置征收灌溉区水费的补充规定”。该局几个急需了解领导上对水土保持工作作何指示的同志，捧着这份驴头不对马嘴的公文，真不知该如何办是好。　徐林茂　宇振南
    向乱拉司机的机关进一言
    最近，轻工业部、国际旅行社、前门饭店等单位，利用较高的工资，通过私人关系，引诱我公司的司机人员离职。这么一来，弄得我公司劳动工资科门庭若市，要求离职的人络绎不绝，严重地影响了我们目前的运输工作。
    我们向缺少司机人员的单位建议：你们如需要我公司协助解决困难，可请求北京市劳动局或北京市汽车运输公司统一调配，不要暗中拉人，以免影响我们的工作。
