Xinhua News Agency, London, October 1st: The short performances given by the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe, which began here on September 28th, have greatly surprised and impressed the London audience.

　　The performances were held at the Princess Theatre, which has 1,500 seats, and the entire theater was packed. Many more people watched their performances on television.

　　When each act began, as the Chinese artists performed what seemed to be so dangerous and even impossible feats, the audience watched them intently, holding their breath. But when they calmly finished these performances, the audience immediately burst into loud cheers and joyful laughter. This exhilarating experience, alternating between tension and relaxation, continued until all the artists suddenly appeared on stage and the performance ended amidst prolonged applause and repeated calls for encores.

　　In recent days, art critics writing reviews in London's national newspapers have unanimously praised the performances of the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe. David Holloway wrote in the "News Chronicle" on September 29th: "What we see here is the dazzling brilliance of a traveling acrobatic troupe that surpasses our best circus performances in headstands and somersaults, marvelous magic, mischievous slapstick, and the dexterity that most of our magicians can only dream of."

　　The Chinese Acrobatic Troupe held its first two public performances on the evenings of September 28th and 29th. The troupe is scheduled to stay in London for three weeks, but many people say they hope the Chinese artists can stay for a few more days.

    伦敦观众盛赞我杂技团的表演
    据新华社伦敦1日电　中国杂技团9月28日起在这里开始的短期演出使伦敦观众大为惊奇和赞赏。
    演出是在设有一千五百个座位的公主剧院举行的，整个剧院挤得满满的。还有许多人从电视机上看他们的表演。
    当每一个节目开始，中国艺术家作着看来那么危险甚至是不可能的表演的时候，观众们都屏着气息全神贯注地看着他们，但是当他们神色自若地结束了这些表演的时候，观众又即刻发出大声的欢呼和愉快的笑声。这种忽而紧张忽而轻松的愉快时刻一直保持到全体艺术家突然在舞台上出现，在一再要求谢幕的长时间的鼓掌声中结束了表演的时候。
    连日来，在伦敦的全国性报纸上发表评论的艺术批评家们，一致赞扬中国杂技团的演出。戴维·霍洛威在9月29日的“新闻纪事报”上写道：“这里看到的是旅行杂技团的奇光异彩，它超过我们最好的马戏团表演的拿大顶和翻斤斗，奇妙的魔术，调皮的滑稽表演，以及我们大部分魔术演员所梦想不到的灵巧。”
    中国杂技团在9月28日和29日晚间连续举行了头两场公演。杂技团预定在伦敦停留三周，但是许多人说，他们希望中国艺术家们能够再多停留几天。
