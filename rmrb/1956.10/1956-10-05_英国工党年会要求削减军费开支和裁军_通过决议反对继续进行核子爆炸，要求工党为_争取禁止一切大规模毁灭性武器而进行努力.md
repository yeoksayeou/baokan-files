Xinhua News Agency, Blackpool, October 4th: The Labour Party's annual conference engaged in a heated debate on foreign policy issues at the afternoon session on October 3rd.

    The conference passed a resolution calling for "substantial cuts in military spending" and "reductions in the size of the armed forces." This resolution was proposed by the National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers. The resolution stated: "The conference, in view of the paralyzing consequences for the economy caused by the current massive arms program, regrets that the present government has not taken sufficient measures to reduce military expenditures." The annual conference also passed a resolution expressing opposition to the continuation of nuclear explosions and calling on the Labour Party to strive to ban all weapons of mass destruction.

    The conference also passed another resolution calling on the British government to cooperate with the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to make new efforts to resolve the issue of European security. This resolution stated that such a resolution should be based on parallel consultations, the purpose of which is: first, to restore German unity through so-called "free and democratic elections"; second, to gradually withdraw military forces controlled by NATO and the Soviet Union from Germany.

    The annual conference believes that a reunified Germany can be accepted to participate in an all-European security convention planned within the scope of the United Nations Charter.

    Member of Parliament Zilliacus, representing the Labour Party organization in Gordon, proposed a resolution calling for the peaceful resolution of international issues in the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This resolution welcomed a number of peaceful measures taken by the Soviet government, particularly the reduction of Soviet armed forces by nearly two million people. The resolution also believed that the Labour Party should discuss issues of peace and international cooperation with the ruling parties of countries that have been in a state of cold war with Britain for the past decade, based on mutual respect for national independence and non-interference in internal affairs.

    This draft resolution was rejected after a lengthy debate due to the firm opposition of the Executive Committee.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Blackpool, October 3rd, TASS reported: The British Labour Party annual conference discussed and passed the third program document drafted by the Executive Committee at the morning session on the 3rd. This is the Labour Party's program on social justice issues, titled with the resounding words "Towards Equality." In this document, the Labour Party leadership, on the one hand, pointed out the shortcomings and injustices of the British modern capitalist system, but at the same time, stipulated for itself the task of not eliminating this system, but only partially "reforming this system."

    英国工党年会要求削减军费开支和裁军
    通过决议反对继续进行核子爆炸，要求工党为
    争取禁止一切大规模毁灭性武器而进行努力
    新华社布莱克浦4日电　工党年会在10月3日下午会议上就外交政策问题展开了热烈的辩论。
    会议通过了一项决议，要求“大量削减军备开支”和“裁减武装部队的数量”。这项决议是由英国全国成衣工人联合会提出的。决议说：“会议鉴于由于目前的庞大军备计划而引起的使经济陷于瘫痪的后果，对于现政府没有采取充分的措施来削减军备费用一点，表示遗憾。”年会也通过了一项决议，表示反对继续进行核子爆炸，并且要求工党为争取禁止一切大规模毁灭性武器而进行努力。
    会议还通过另外一项决议，要求英国政府同美国、法国和苏联合作，为解决欧洲安全问题而进行新的努力。这项决议说，这种解决应该以进行平行的商谈为基础，这种商谈的目的在于，第一、通过所谓“自由和民主的选举”恢复德国的统一，第二、逐步从德国撤出由北大西洋公约组织和苏联控制的军事部队。
    年会认为，可以接受重新统一的德国参加在联合国宪章范围内所策划的全欧的安全公约。
    议员齐里亚库斯代表果顿地方的工党组织提出了一项决议案，要求根据和平共处原则的精神和平解决国际问题。这项决议案对苏联政府采取的一些和平措施，特别是把苏联武装部队裁减将近二百万人的措施表示欢迎。决议案还认为，工党应该在互相尊重国家独立和互不干涉内政的基础上，同十年来一直和英国处在冷战状态的各国的执政党讨论有关和平和国际合作的问题。
    这个决议草案由于执行委员会的坚决反对而在经过长时间的辩论以后被否决。
    据新华社4日讯　据塔斯社布莱克浦3日讯：英国工党年会3日上午会议讨论和通过了执行委员会草拟的第三项纲领文件，这就是用“通向平等的道路”这几个响亮的字眼作为标题的、工党在社会正义问题上的纲领。在这个文件中，工党领导机构一方面指出了英国现代资本主义制度的缺陷和不公正，但是同时却为自己规定这样的任务：不消灭这一制度，而只是部分地“改良这一制度”。
