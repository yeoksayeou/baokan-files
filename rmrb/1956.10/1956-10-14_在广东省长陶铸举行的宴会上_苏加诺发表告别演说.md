Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 13th: President Sukarno said at a banquet hosted by Guangdong Governor Tao Zhu in his honor tonight that Asian and African countries must rise up and unite to resolutely oppose imperialism and colonialism. The President said, "We believe that one day imperialism and colonialism will disappear from the world."

President Sukarno bid farewell to the Chinese people and government. He said that after speaking to Guangdong youth tomorrow morning, he would go to Kunming and return to his country via Rangoon.

President Sukarno said that this visit to China coincided with a day of great significance in the history of China and the world—people all over the world are uniting to oppose imperialism and colonialism. The President said, "I firmly believe that as long as we unite and fight, we will definitely succeed."

The President continued, "A great era is changing. China has broken away from the era of misery and suffering. The Chinese people have entered a new era of joy and brilliance. They will build a prosperous and free country and work with the people of the world to establish world peace."

President Sukarno said that he firmly believed that this great historical transformation in China would be successful. He said, "I am about to say that this is because, based on my visit over the past ten days or so, I have seen that the land of China is fertile and its material strength is strong, but I have also seen something more precious than material things: the Chinese people, the people who work hard, the diligent people, the people who strive for freedom and independence, and the people who are united."

President Sukarno said that the old era has passed. The 20th century is an era of drastic changes. In this era, three things are most exciting: first, the establishment of socialist countries; second, the rise of Asian and African countries to unite and resolutely oppose imperialism and colonialism, firmly believing that one day imperialism and colonialism will disappear from the world; and third, the birth of atomic science. President Sukarno called on all mankind to unite and oppose the use of atomic energy to create wars and threaten humanity.

The President said: "Some groups dislike and discriminate against the People's Republic of China. I would like to say for the third time during this visit that these people, 600 million people, are freedom-loving, independent, hardworking, diligent, and united people under consolidated leadership. They will not die and will live forever."

President Sukarno said that he and his entourage received a brotherly and friendly welcome in China and were surrounded by sincere friendship everywhere. The President said, "How can we forget the loving eyes of our Chinese brothers towards us? This is love for the 82 million Indonesian people." The President especially mentioned the enthusiasm of the youth and children, saying, "We will never forget this love."

Finally, President Sukarno raised his glass to the friendship between the two brotherly countries of China and Indonesia and to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong.

Before and after President Sukarno's speech, Governor Tao Zhu and Vice Premier Chen Yi also spoke.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that some people are jealous of the growing consolidation and development of the friendship between China and Indonesia, and they may attempt to sow discord by exploiting the differences in ideology between the two countries. Chen Yi emphasized that there are indeed differences in ideology between countries in the world, as well as differences in the national systems of various countries. Each nation has its own characteristics, and it is fundamentally impossible to apply one type to all nations. The great Indonesian nation and the great Chinese nation certainly have their own national characteristics and cannot be exactly the same, including in ideology. This is a matter of common sense. But as President Sukarno has repeatedly pointed out, the vast majority of people around the world oppose the enslavement of colonialism and oppose the oppression and aggression of imperialism. This is a common idea, and this is completely consistent.

Chen Yi said that the Chinese people fully understand President Sukarno's characteristic, which is to serve the Indonesian people loyally and to serve world peace loyally.

Chen Yi said that as a Chinese citizen, although he has ideological differences with President Sukarno, for the common interests of the two countries, that is, the common interest of opposing colonialism, he fully supports President Sukarno.

Chen Yi praised President Sukarno for the Panchasila, the Five Principles doctrine, created based on the thoughts of advanced figures from various countries in the world and combined with the actual situation in Indonesia, and for his democratic spirit as a national leader. He said that President Sukarno puts the entire nation first and does not forget his comrades who share weal and woe. This spirit makes him very admired.

In his speech, Tao Zhu first expressed a warm welcome to President Sukarno's visit to Guangzhou. He said that Guangzhou is a historical city with a glorious revolutionary tradition. Today, the people of Guangzhou are able to welcome the visit of Your Excellency the President, which adds even more glory and joy to us.

More than 300 people, including leaders of the Guangdong Party, government, and army, as well as people from all walks of life, attended the banquet tonight. Huang Zhen, Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia, and Wijopoanoto, Indonesian Ambassador to China, also attended the banquet tonight.

After the banquet, President Sukarno and his entourage of senior officials attended an evening party and enjoyed the Cantonese opera "Phoenix Ritual Palace" and Cantonese music.

    在广东省长陶铸举行的宴会上
    苏加诺发表告别演说
    新华社广州13日电　苏加诺总统今晚在广东省省长陶铸为欢迎他举行的宴会上说，亚非国家必须奋起团结，坚决反对帝国主义和殖民主义。总统说，我们相信，世界上终有一天会看不见帝国主义和殖民主义。
    苏加诺总统向中国人民和政府告别。他说，明天早晨他向广东省青年讲话后，就要到昆明经仰光回国。
    苏加诺总统说，这次来中国访问，正值对中国和全世界历史上都具有重大意义的日子——全世界人民都在团结起来反对帝国主义和殖民主义。总统说：我深信，只要团结斗争，就一定能完成。
    总统接着说，大时代在转变着，中国脱离了悲惨、苦恼的时代，中国人民已进入一个新的欢快灿烂的时代，他们将建设一个繁荣和自由的国家，并且和全世界人民一道建立世界和平。
    苏加诺总统说，他深信中国这一次伟大的历史转变一定能够获得成功。他说：我正要说是因为根据我在十多天来的访问中，看到中国土地肥沃和物质力量的强大，可是我还看到比物质更可贵的是中国人民，努力工作的人民，勤劳的人民，为自由独立的人民，团结一致的人民。
    苏加诺总统说，旧时代已经过去了，二十世纪是激烈变动的时代，在这个时代有三件事最令人兴奋，一是社会主义国家的成立；二是亚非国家奋起团结，坚决反对帝国主义和殖民主义，深信终有一天世界上看不见帝国主义和殖民主义；三是原子科学的诞生。苏加诺总统号召全世界人类团结起来，反对用原子制造战争、威胁人类的行动。
    总统说：有些集团不喜欢、并且歧视中华人民共和国，我愿意在我这一次访问中第三次说，这些人民，六万万人民是爱好自由的，独立的，努力工作的，勤劳的，在巩固的领导下团结一致的人民，不会死亡，将永远生存下去。
    苏加诺总统说，这次他和他的随员在中国受到兄弟般的友谊的欢迎，到处被忠诚的友谊所包围。总统说：我们怎能忘却中国兄弟们对我们充满热爱的眼光，这是对八千二百万印度尼西亚人民的热爱。总统这时特别提到了青年和孩童的热情，他说：这种热爱我们将永世不忘。
    最后，苏加诺总统举杯祝中国和印度尼西亚两国兄弟的友谊和毛泽东主席的健康。
    苏加诺总统讲话前后，陶铸省长和陈毅副总理也讲了话。
    陈毅副总理说，有人因为中国和印度尼西亚两国间的友谊一天天巩固和发展表现忌妒，他们可能企图就两国意识形态不同来进行挑拨。陈毅强调说，世界各国之间确实存在着意识形态的不同，也存在着各国国家制度的不同，各民族各有其自己的特点，企图用一种类型套用在一切民族头上当然是根本行不通的。伟大的印度尼西亚民族和伟大的中国民族当然各有其民族特点，不可能完全一样，包括意识形态在内，这是常识问题。但正如苏加诺总统一再揭露的，他说，全世界大多数人民反对殖民主义的奴役，反对帝国主义的压迫和侵略，这是共同的思想，这完全是一致的。
    陈毅说，中国人民完全了解苏加诺总统的特点，就是忠诚地为印度尼西亚人民服务，忠诚地为世界和平服务。
    陈毅说，他以一个中国公民的资格，虽然同苏加诺总统存在着意识形态的不同，但是为了两国的共同利益，即反对殖民主义的共同利益，他完全拥护苏加诺总统。
    陈毅称赞苏加诺总统根据世界各国先进人物的思想，结合印度尼西亚实际情况所创造的潘查希拉五基学说和作为一个国家领导人的民主精神。他说，苏加诺总统把整个民族放在第一位，不忘共同甘苦的战友，这种精神使他非常钦佩。
    陶铸在讲话中首先对苏加诺总统访问广州表示热烈的欢迎。他说，广州是具有光辉革命传统的历史名城。今天广州人民能够迎接总统阁下的访问，更加增添了我们的光辉和欢乐。
    出席今晚宴会的，有广东省党、政府和军队的负责人以及社会各界人士共三百多人。中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇和印度尼西亚驻中国大使维约普拉诺托也出席了今晚的宴会。
    宴会后，苏加诺总统和随行的高级官员出席了晚会，欣赏了粤剧“凤仪宫”和广东音乐。
