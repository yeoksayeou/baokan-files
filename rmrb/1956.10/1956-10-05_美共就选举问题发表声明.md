Xinhua News Agency, October 3rd: TASS, New York, October 3rd: According to the "Worker Daily" report, the Communist Party of the United States recently held a special meeting on the election issue. The meeting was attended by 150 representatives from thirty-six states. The statement adopted at the meeting said that the Communist Party will not support any presidential candidate in this year's election, and will devote all its strength to the struggle to defend peace, civil rights, democratic rights, and the welfare of the American people.

The statement expressed agreement with the task put forward by the American trade unions: "To defeat the government of big capitalists," while emphasizing that the workers' movement should achieve greater political independence on the basis of uniting all its political forces.

The statement, referring to the Communist Party's past nomination of its own US presidential and vice-presidential candidates, pointed out that "some anti-democratic laws that we have been demanding to abolish, in fact make it impossible for us to nominate Communist Party candidates for 1956."

The statement said, "Although the Communist Party does not support any presidential candidate, Communist Party members participating in trade unions and other organizations can still devote themselves to the political struggle of their organizations against big capitalists and their running dogs."

"The growing strength of trade unions, black people, and the peasant movement has forced some major candidates to promise to undertake certain major obligations. Regardless of the outcome of the election, the people should carry out serious legislative and political struggles to meet their demands, thereby ultimately affecting the balance of domestic political forces. Only struggle, only the unity of all trade unions and their members on all issues before, during, and after the election, can guarantee peace, security, and democracy."

    美共就选举问题发表声明
    在大选中不支持任何一个总统候选人，它要把自己全部力量放在保卫和平、公民权利、民主权利和美国人民福利的斗争上。
    新华社3日讯　塔斯社纽约3日讯：据“工人日报”报道，美国共产党不久以前就竞选问题举行了一次专门会议。出席会议的有来自三十六个州的一百五十名代表。会议通过的声明说，共产党在今年的大选中不支持任何一个总统候选人，它要把自己全部力量放在保卫和平、公民权利、民主权利和美国人民福利的斗争上。
    声明表示赞同美国工会提出的任务：“使大资本家的政府遭到失败”，同时强调指出，工人运动应当在团结自己全部政治力量的基础上取得更大的政治独立性。
    声明在提到共产党过去曾经提出过自己的美国总统和副总统候选人以后指出，“我们一直在要求废除的一些反民主的法律，事实上使我们没有可能提出1956年度的共产党候选人。”
    声明说，“虽然共产党不支持任何一个总统候选人，但是参加工会和其他组织的共产党员还是可以投入自己的组织为反对大资本家及其走狗而进行的政治斗争。”
      “工会、黑人和农民运动的力量日益增长，他们已经迫使一些主要候选人答应承担某些巨大义务。无论选举结果如何，人民都应当进行严肃的立法斗争和政治斗争，争取满足自己的要求，从而最后影响国内政治力量的对比。只有斗争、只有各工会及其会员在选举前、选举期间和选举以后在一切问题上团结一致，才有可能保证和平、安全和民主。”
