Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 16th - U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower announced on October 15th that the U.S. government, after careful study, has decided to continue giving Yugoslavia “economic aid” and some “military aid.”

This decision was announced in a letter Eisenhower wrote to the Speakers of both houses of Congress. Since the normalization of relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, there have been constant threats in the U.S. Congress to stop aid to Yugoslavia, and Congress has demanded that the President make a final decision on whether continued aid to Yugoslavia is “in the interests of the United States.”

In this policy statement responding to Congress, Eisenhower stated that the government's decision was made after "weighing all the evidence currently available." Eisenhower said, "Economic assistance to Yugoslavia can now be cautiously and wisely continued." However, with regard to military aid, the U.S. government will temporarily not deliver to Yugoslavia approximately two hundred U.S. jet aircraft and other heavy military equipment that the U.S. had previously planned to deliver. He said this ban will remain in effect until "a more accurate judgment can be made in the future" regarding the relationship between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.

### 艾森豪威尔宣布  美国对南“援助”的政策

    艾森豪威尔宣布
    美国对南“援助”的政策
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔10月15日宣布：美国政府在经过仔细研究后决定继续给南斯拉夫以“经济援助”和某些“军事援助”。
    这个决定是在艾森豪威尔写给国会两院议长的信里宣布的。自从南斯拉夫同苏联的关系正常化以来，美国国会中曾经不断发出要停止对南斯拉夫援助的威胁，国会并且要求总统就继续援助南斯拉夫“是否符合美国利益”的问题作出最后裁决。
    艾森豪威尔在答复国会的这个政策声明中表示，政府的决定是在“权衡目前所有的证据”以后作出的。艾森豪威尔说，“给予南斯拉夫的经济援助现在可以谨慎地、明智地继续进行”。但是，在军事援助方面，美国政府将暂不把美国以前预定要交付的约二百架美国喷气式飞机和其他重型军事装备交付给南斯拉夫。他说这个禁令要保持到“今后能够更正确地判断”南斯拉夫和苏联的关系的时候。
