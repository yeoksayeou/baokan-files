Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 4th: A memorandum to the United Nations General Assembly adopted by the Eighth Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council states that the WFTU Council, representing its 88 million members, calls on the United Nations General Assembly to take new steps to universally and effectively realize the desire of the world's peace-loving forces to strengthen peace and international security, and to develop friendly relations among the peoples of all countries based on respect for national independence, the right to national self-determination, and the expansion of international cooperation in economic, social, and cultural fields.

The memorandum states that the WFTU Council notes with satisfaction that the admission of sixteen countries as members of the United Nations has played a positive role in easing international tensions, and it hopes that the People's Republic of China will also obtain a legitimate position in the United Nations.

The participants in the WFTU Council meeting hope and believe that the current United Nations General Assembly will make decisive progress in universal and supervised disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

The WFTU Council points out that it pays great attention to the efforts made by the United Nations in assisting underdeveloped countries to develop their economies, but the Council also sees that the results currently achieved are still very small. Therefore, it requests the United Nations General Assembly to adopt a resolution to urge the United Nations to provide underdeveloped countries with assistance that can promote the comprehensive development of their economies.

In view of the growing role of Africa in the world economy and the legitimate demands of the African people, the Council hopes that the United Nations General Assembly will carefully study the proposal to establish an Economic Commission for Africa.

In its memorandum, the WFTU Council urges the United Nations General Assembly to pay attention to the issues of wage and income levels of working people, as well as working hours, production automation, and other issues in which working people themselves are directly interested.

The Council also urges the United Nations General Assembly to pay attention to the growing strength of male and female workers in opposing discrimination against women in political, economic, and social life, and expresses the hope that the United Nations General Assembly meeting will ensure progress in the work of the Commission on the Status of Women, and promote the work of the International Labour Organization, particularly on the issue of ensuring equal pay for equal work for men and women.

The memorandum concludes by emphasizing that the WFTU will continue to work hard in the future to further expand cooperation with the United Nations, support all the work of the United Nations aimed at meeting the aspirations of working people, and make its utmost efforts to promote peaceful cooperation among the peoples of all countries and the independence of oppressed countries, defend human rights, and promote the welfare of working people.

    致联合国大会的备忘录
    新华社5日讯  据保加利亚通讯社索非亚4日讯：世界工会联合会理事会第八次会议通过的一份致联合国大会的备忘录说，世界工联理事会代表它的八千八百万个会员呼吁联合国大会采取新的步骤，以便普遍有效地实现世界爱好和平力量要求加强和平和国际安全，以及在尊重民族独立、民族自决权和扩大经济、社会关系及文化方面的国际合作的基础上，发展各国人民之间的友好关系的愿望。
    备忘录说，世界工联理事会满意地指出，十六个国家被接纳为联合国会员国一事在缓和国际紧张局势方面起了良好的作用，它希望中华人民共和国也将在联合国中得到合法的地位。
    世界工联理事会会议参加者希望并且相信，本届联合国大会将在普遍和有监督的裁军和禁止原子武器方面取得具有决定意义的进展。
    世界工联理事会指出，它非常注意联合国在援助不发达国家发展它们的经济方面所作的努力，但是理事会也看到，目前所取得的结果还是非常微小的，为此，它要求联合国大会通过决定，促使联合国给予不发达国家以能够促进它们经济的全面发展的援助。
    鉴于非洲在世界经济中作用的不断增长和非洲人民应有的要求，理事会希望，联合国大会将仔细地研究关于成立非洲经济委员会的建议。

    备忘录最后着重指出，世界工联今后仍将继续努力工作，进一步扩大同联合国的合作，支持联合国旨在满足劳动人民愿望的一切工作，尽最大努力促进各国人民的和平合作和被压迫国家的独立，保卫人权和增进劳动人民的福利。
