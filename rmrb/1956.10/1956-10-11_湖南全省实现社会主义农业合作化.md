Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 7th - Socialist agricultural cooperativization has been achieved throughout Hunan Province, one of China's major rice-producing areas. Currently, peasant households participating in advanced agricultural cooperatives account for more than 90% of the total number of households in the province. The original 80,000+ elementary cooperatives, through mergers and the absorption of individual farmers from outside the cooperatives, have been transformed into 45,500+ advanced agricultural cooperatives. The scale of these cooperatives averages around 160-170 households.

Hunan Province began experimenting with agricultural cooperatives in 1953, and by the spring of this year, had basically achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization throughout the province. At the same time, more than 4,300 advanced cooperatives were piloted in various parts of the province. Because the vast majority of farmers participated in agricultural cooperatives, giving play to the superiority of cooperative management, the amount of fertilizer accumulated throughout the province this year more than doubled that of the previous year. Earthwork projects for regulating irrigation and drainage systems in the lake areas also exceeded any previous year in history; 730,000+ agricultural water conservancy projects were built in hilly and mountainous areas, including more than 1,300 newly built reservoirs alone, which is more than the total number of reservoirs built in the years since liberation. Therefore, although most hilly and mountainous areas had not had much rain for 100 consecutive days this year, they still achieved bumper harvests in places where reservoirs had been built.

Over the past year of cooperativization movement, the farmers have further realized the benefits of joining agricultural cooperatives, especially the members of elementary cooperatives who saw that advanced cooperatives were even better, and voluntarily gave up land remuneration, urgently demanding to be transformed into advanced cooperatives. In order to meet the farmers' demands, the Party organizations at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province began training key personnel and other work from May, to prepare for leading elementary cooperatives to transform into advanced cooperatives. During the preparation period, the pilot work of transferring to cooperatives was also carried out in various places in combination with drought resistance and production disaster relief. Many places set up cooperativization consultation offices, organized propaganda teams to widely publicize the principles, policies and practices of running advanced cooperatives to the farmers. By the beginning of September, all localities had comprehensively started building cooperatives.

Now, most of the more than 40,000 newly built advanced cooperatives in Hunan Province have formulated production plans for the autumn and winter seasons and have promptly shifted to production. The 3,641 cooperatives in the Changde area have sown 2,230,000+ mu of autumn and winter crops. Some cooperatives are planning to use the winter slack season to develop diversified operations and sideline production.

Due to the large task and short time, some economic issues in some areas have not been resolved in time during the establishment of advanced cooperatives, and are currently being resolved in conjunction with production.

### 湖南全省实现社会主义农业合作化

    湖南全省实现社会主义农业合作化
    新华社长沙7日电　我国稻谷主要产区之一的湖南全省已经实现了社会主义的农业合作化。现在，全省参加高级农业社的农户，已占全省总农户的90％以上，原来的八万多个初级社，经过合并和吸收个别社外农民参加，已经转为四万五千五百多个高级农业社。这些社的规模，平均都在一百六、七十户左右。
    湖南省从1953年开始试办农业社，到今年春天，全省就基本上实现了半社会主义的农业合作化。同时还在全省各地试办了四千三百多个高级社。由于绝大多数农民参加了农业社，发挥了合作经营的优越性，今年全省积的肥料超过前年一倍多。滨湖地区整理排灌系统的土方工程也超过历史上任何一年；丘陵区和山区兴修的农田水利工程达七十三万多处，其中仅新修的水库就有一千三百多个，比解放后几年来所修水库的总数还多。因此，今年大部分丘陵区和山区虽然连续一百天没有下过多少雨，但是，在修了水库的地方仍然获得丰收。
    经过近一年来的合作化运动，农民们进一步体会了参加农业社的好处，特别是初级社的社员看到高级社的优越性更大，都自愿取消土地报酬，迫切要求转为高级社。为了满足农民们的这种要求，中共湖南省各级党组织从5月份就开始进行训练骨干等工作，为领导初级社转为高级社做好准备工作。在准备期间，各地还结合抗旱和生产救灾进行了转社的试点工作。许多地方设立了合作化问事处，组织宣传队伍广泛向农民宣传办高级社的方针、政策和做法。到9月初，各地即全面开始建社。
    现在，湖南省新建的四万多个高级社，绝大部分已经订出了秋冬季的生产计划，及时转向生产。常德专区的三千六百四十一个社已经播种了秋冬作物二百二十三万多亩。有些社正计划利用冬闲开展多种经营和副业生产。
    由于任务大、时间短，部分地区在建立高级社的工作中，还有些经济方面的问题未能及时处理，目前正结合生产进行处理。
