    Northwest State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 4 Officially Begins Production

    (Our Dispatch) The Northwest State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 4, the largest modern cotton textile factory in the Northwest region, held its opening ceremony on September 29th. The construction area of this cotton textile factory is more than 184,000 square meters, which is larger than the total construction area of the Northwest State-Owned Cotton Mills No. 1 and No. 2. It has more than 100,000 spindles, 26,600 thread spindles, and more than 3,200 automatic looms. These machines can not only produce plain cloth, but also more than 40% of them can produce higher-grade products such as gabardine and woolen serge, which were not produced in the Northwest region in the past. The cloth produced annually is enough for 20 million people to make a new set of clothes each.

    This modern cotton textile factory was designed by Chinese designers in accordance with the latest technical standards under the guidance of Soviet experts. Because it has absorbed past experience, it is more advanced in design and equipment than the newly built Northwest State-Owned Cotton Mills No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 after liberation. For example, the two automated "dust filter rooms" set up in the opening and cleaning workshop can keep the workshop environment clean and reduce yarn breakage. In terms of machinery and equipment, automated "combined opening and cleaning machines," "three-passage roving frames," and "high-speed winders" have been added here, which will play a significant role in saving labor, increasing output, and improving quality.

    During the construction process of Northwest State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 4, it received support from all parties. Nearly ten kinds of automated machines newly installed here came from machine manufacturing factories in Shanghai and Tianjin, and some came from Qingdao and Zhengzhou. Of the factory's 6,800 workers, one-third are veteran workers supported by fraternal textile factories from all over the country. After arriving at Northwest State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 4, they helped train new workers on the one hand, and unified operation methods and learned to use new machines on the other. After several months of training, most of the three to four thousand new workers from Shanghai and Shaanxi have been able to work independently. Generally, fine yarn workers can watch 400 to 800 spindles, and weaving workers can watch 16 to 24 looms.

    西北国棉四厂正式投入生产
    本报讯　西北地区规模最大的现代化棉纺织厂——西北国棉四厂，在9月29日举行了开工典礼。这个棉纺织厂的建筑面积达十八万四千多平方公尺，比西北国棉一、二厂建筑面积的总和还要大。它拥有十万多枚纱绽，二万六千六百枚线锭，三千二百多台自动布机。这些机器不仅能生产平布，而且有40％以上可以生产过去西北地区没有生产过的华达呢、线哔叽等较高级的产品。每年生产的布匹，足够二千万人每人做一套新衣服。
    这座现代化棉纺织厂是在苏联专家的指导下，由我国设计人员按照最新的技术标准进行设计的。由于吸取了过去的经验，它在设计、设备等方面，比解放后新建立起来的西北国棉一、二、三厂，都更先进。如在清花车间设立的两个自动化的“滤尘室”，可使车间环境清洁，也能减少断头。在机器设备方面，这里增加了自动化“联合清花机”、“三道粗纱机”和“高速络筒机”等，对节约人力，提高产量和质量将起很大作用。
    西北国棉四厂在建设过程中，曾得到各方面的支援，在这里新安装起来的将近十种自动化机器，有的来自上海和天津，有的来自青岛和郑州的机器制造工厂。这个厂的六千八百多工人中，有三分之一是各地兄弟纺织厂支援的老工人。他们来到西北国棉四厂后，一方面帮助培养新工人，一方面统一操作方法，学习使用新机器。来自上海和陕西各地的三、四千名新工人，经过几个月的培训，绝大部分已经能够独立工作，一般细纱工人能看四百至八百纱锭，织布工人能看十六至二十四台布机。
