    Shandong Province's Highway Network Initially Formed
    (Our dispatch) A preliminary highway transportation network has been formed in Shandong Province. As of now, all 112 counties in the province, except for Weishan County, are accessible by automobile.
    The total length of highways in Shandong Province is 9,270 kilometers (an increase of 44.8% compared to 1950), of which 1,234 kilometers are passable by automobile year-round, regardless of weather. In addition, over 1,000 kilometers of general economic trunk lines can be used by automobiles promptly after rain, following renovation.
    Due to the development of highway transportation, the previously closed-off state of transportation in some mountainous areas has been preliminarily changed, making the urban and rural economies increasingly active. Currently, approximately 2,000 automobiles and tens of thousands of rubber-wheeled carts and civilian iron-wooden wheeled carts transport industrial products from cities and grain and industrial raw materials from rural areas to their destinations daily. According to statistics from the first half of this year, over 3.2 million tons of goods were transported via highways, an increase of 10% compared to the same period last year, greatly promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and the prosperity of the market. For example, the mountain dried fruits produced in the Xiying District of Licheng County were often subject to spoilage in the past due to the lack of passable roads; in 1953 alone, over 400,000 jin were spoiled. Now, they can all be transported and sold in a timely manner.
    In order to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production and facilitate people's travel, the Shandong Provincial Communications Department has made preliminary plans for the development of highway transportation. By the end of 1957, the total length of highways passable by automobile in the province will be expanded to 19,070 kilometers, an increase of 105.7% compared to the present. The length of highways passable by automobile year-round, regardless of weather, will increase by 26.9% compared to the present. (Zhang)

    山东省公路网初步形成
    本报讯　山东全省的公路交通网已初步形成。到目前为止，全省一百十二个县，除微山县外，各县之间均可通行汽车。
    山东省公路全长九千二百七十公里（比1950年增加了44.8％），其中一千二百三十四公里可以常年晴雨无阻地通行汽车。还有一千多公里长的一般经济干线，经过改造以后，也可以在雨后及时通行汽车。
    由于公路交通的发展，初步改变了过去某些山区交通闭塞的状况，使得城乡经济日益活跃。现在，每日约有二千辆汽车，数万辆胶轮大车和民间的铁木轮大车，分别将城市的工业产品和农村的粮食，工业原料运往目的地。据今年上半年统计，经公路运输的物资即达三百二十余万吨，比去年同期增加了10％，大大地促进了城乡物资交流和市场的繁荣。例如历城县西营区一带盛产的山干果，过去因为没有通车的道路，经常发生霉烂现象，仅1953年即霉烂了四十余万斤，现在，都能及时运销出去了。
    为了满足工农业生产的需要和便利人民旅行，山东省交通部门已作出了发展公路交通的初步规划。到1957年底，全省通行汽车的公路将发展到一万九千零七十公里，比现在增加105.7％。其中能够常年晴雨无阻地通行汽车的公路，将比现在增加26.9％。　（章）
