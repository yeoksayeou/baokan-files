    Further Develop Trade Between China and Indonesia
    Luo Wan
    Since the signing of the China-Indonesia Trade Agreement in November 1953 and the China-Indonesia Trade Protocol in September 1954, trade between the two countries has greatly developed. In terms of trade volume, China's imports from Indonesia in 1955 were 289% of those in 1954, and the first half of 1956 was 655% of the same period in 1955; China's exports to Indonesia in 1955 were 316% of those in 1954, and the first half of 1956 was 368% of the same period in 1955, greatly exceeding the amount of three million pounds each year stipulated in the trade protocol. In terms of commodity exchange, the variety of commodities imported by China from Indonesia has increased compared to the past, and the variety of commodities exported by China to Indonesia has increased even more. In addition to traditional native products and minerals, daily industrial products, hardware, steel, and small machinery are also exported.
    The reasons why trade between China and Indonesia can develop rapidly are, first, that both countries are rich in products and can exchange a relatively large number of commodities. China's main imports from Indonesia are rubber, copra, sugar, sisal hemp, etc., which are raw materials needed by China's industry or important consumer goods for people's daily life. China's main exports to Indonesia are cotton yarn, cotton cloth, etc., which are also the main commodities imported by Indonesia every year. Secondly, the governments of both countries have adopted many active measures to implement the signed trade agreement and trade protocol. The Chinese government's policy is to conduct trade with any country on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Indonesia is our friendly country, and the Chinese government is doing its best to ensure that they can be implemented smoothly. For example, the relevant import and export companies in China execute contracts seriously, deliver goods quickly, and rarely find commodities that do not meet specifications; the commodities supplied by China to Indonesia are of excellent quality and low price, and merchants who operate them are profitable, and consumers are also satisfied. The trade protocol between the two countries stipulates that the swing amount is 600,000 pounds, and foreign exchange must be paid when it is exceeded. This spring, China's exports to Indonesia have exceeded this limit, but China continues to supply goods. This prevents trade between the two countries from being affected by the limitation of the swing amount. Similarly, the Indonesian government has also taken many measures. For example, in early 1955, the Indonesian government promulgated the "Parallel Trade Regulations." According to these regulations, copra, sugar, etc. cannot be exported on account, but the Indonesian government agreed that the above-mentioned commodities would still be exported to China on account. This is of great help to the smooth implementation of the trade protocol. The Indonesian government's approval of merchants' applications for import licenses from China or export licenses to China is also relatively rapid.
    Now the Indonesian government trade delegation has arrived in Beijing to negotiate and sign a new trade agreement and trade protocol. We firmly believe that trade between the two countries will be further developed.
    Rubber is one of Indonesia's most important export commodities, and it is also China's most important import commodity from Indonesia. With the development of industrial construction, China's demand for rubber is increasing year by year. When the trade agreement and trade protocol were signed last time, Indonesia could not export rubber to China, which limited the trade volume between the two countries; but now the Indonesian government has announced that it will export rubber to China.
    The Indonesian government is starting to implement a five-year economic construction plan and needs to import industrial equipment. Now China can not only export daily industrial products, but also export complete sets of light industrial equipment. Not long ago, relevant Chinese companies signed a contract with relevant departments of the Burmese government to supply complete sets of equipment for a 20,000-spindle cotton textile factory. China can also supply Indonesia with complete sets of light industrial equipment according to Indonesia's needs and China's existing strength to help Indonesia's industrial construction.
    Trade between China and Indonesia is conducted on an account basis, and foreign exchange does not need to be paid for each transaction. The governments of both countries do not have to worry about restricting imports due to the need to pay foreign exchange. When China or Indonesia exceeds the time limit, they can increase exports to the other party to reduce the difference. This trade payment method has played a role in facilitating and promoting the development of trade between the two countries.
    Indonesia is China's close neighbor. The two countries are not far away geographically, delivery is faster, freight is lower, and capital turnover is also faster. Trade between the two countries has a long history. Therefore, China does not need to purchase goods that Indonesia can supply from other countries that are geographically far away; similarly, Indonesia can also not need to purchase goods that China can supply from other countries that are geographically far away.
    The governments of China and Indonesia both have the desire to continue to develop trade between the two countries. In May 1955, Djuanda, Director of the Indonesian National Planning Bureau, and Hasuno Reksoamojo, a senior official of the Department of Foreign Economic Relations of the Ministry of Economy, who accompanied Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo on a visit to China, discussed trade issues between the two countries with relevant Chinese authorities. Both sides expressed their desire to continue to develop trade between the two countries. On June 2, 1956, Premier Zhou Enlai said when he met with Indonesian journalists: "In order to help each other's economic development, our two countries can exchange what we have in raw materials and products, and complement each other's strengths in production technology and experience."
    Further developing trade and technical cooperation between China and Indonesia not only helps the economic construction of the two countries and the improvement of the lives of the people of the two countries, but also specifically embodies the spirit of the Bandung Conference's resolution on strengthening economic cooperation among Asian and African countries. It is in the interests of the people of China and Indonesia.

    进一步发展中国和印度尼西亚的贸易
    罗万
    1953年11月中国—印度尼西亚贸易协定和1954年9月中国—印度尼西亚贸易议定书签订后，两国贸易有了很大的发展。在贸易额方面，我国从印度尼西亚的进口，1955年等于1954年的289％，1956年上半年等于1955年同期的655％；我国对印度尼西亚的出口，1955年等于1954年的316％，1956年上半年等于1955年同期的368％，大大超过了贸易议定书规定的双方每年各出口三百万英镑的金额。在商品交换方面，我国从印度尼西亚进口的商品品种比以前增加了，我国对印度尼西亚出口的商品品种增加得更多，除传统的土特产品和矿产品外，还输出了日用工业品、五金钢材和小型机器。
    我国和印度尼西亚的贸易能够迅速发展的原因，首先是两国的物产都很丰富，可以交换的商品比较多。我国从印度尼西亚进口的主要商品是橡胶、椰干、砂糖、西沙尔麻等，这些都是我国工业需要的原料或人民日常生活重要的消费品，我国对印度尼西亚出口的主要商品是棉纱、棉布等，这些也都是印度尼西亚每年进口的主要商品。其次是两国政府对签订的贸易协定和贸易议定书都采取了很多积极办法使它们能够实现。我国政府的政策是在平等互利的基础上和任何国家进行贸易，印度尼西亚是我们的友好国家，我国政府竭力使它们能够顺利地执行。例如，我国有关进出口公司执行合同认真，交货迅速，商品很少发现不符合规格；我国供应印度尼西亚的商品品质优良，价格也较低廉，经营的商人有利可图，消费者也感到满意。两国的贸易议定书规定摆动额是六十万英镑，超过时要以外汇支付。今年春我国对印度尼西亚的出口已经超过这个限额，但是我国仍继续供应货物。这样使两国的贸易不因摆动额的限制而受到影响。同样地，印度尼西亚政府也采取了许多措施。例如，1955年初印度尼西亚政府曾颁布“平行贸易条例”，根据该条例，椰干、砂糖等不能用记账输出，但是印度尼西亚政府同意上述商品仍用记账方式对我国出口。这对贸易议定书的顺利执行是有很大的帮助的。印度尼西亚政府对商人申请从我国进口或对我国出口的许可证的批发，也是比较迅速的。
    现在印度尼西亚政府贸易代表团已经到达北京谈判签订新的贸易协定和贸易议定书，我们深信两国的贸易还会有进一步的发展。
    橡胶是印度尼西亚最主要的出口商品之一，也是我国从印度尼西亚进口的最主要商品，随着工业建设的发展，我国对橡胶的需要量逐年增加。上次签订贸易协定和贸易议定书时，印度尼西亚还不能对我国出口橡胶，这就限制了两国的贸易额；但是现在印度尼西亚政府已经宣布对我国出口橡胶了。
    印度尼西亚政府正在开始实行五年经济建设计划，需要进口工业设备。现在我国不仅可以出口日用工业品，而且可以出口一些轻工业的成套设备。不久以前我国有关公司曾经和缅甸政府有关部门签订了供应二万纱锭棉纺织厂成套设备的合同。我国也可以根据印度尼西亚的需要和我国现有的力量供应印度尼西亚轻工业成套设备，帮助印度尼西亚的工业建设。
    中国和印度尼西亚两国的贸易是采取记账的方式的，不需要每笔交易都支付外汇，两国政府都不必顾虑因为要付出外汇而限制进口，中国或者印度尼西亚入超时，可以增加向对方出口使差额减少。这种贸易支付方式对发展两国的贸易起了便利和促进的作用。
    印度尼西亚是我国的近邻，两国在地理上距离不远，交货较快，运费较低，资金周转也较迅速，两国贸易又有长久的历史，因此，我国需要的商品，印度尼西亚能够供应的，就不必向其他在地理上距离较远的国家购买；同样地，印度尼西亚需要的商品，我国能够供应的，也可以不必向其他在地理上距离较远的国家购买。
    中国和印度尼西亚两国政府当局都有继续发展两国贸易的愿望。1955年5月随阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理来华访问的印度尼西亚国家计划局局长朱安达和经济部对外经济关系司高级官员哈苏诺·雷克梭阿莫佐，曾经和我国有关当局商谈两国贸易的问题，双方都表示了继续发展两国贸易的愿望。1956年6月2日周恩来总理接见印度尼西亚记者时曾经说：“为了互相帮助经济发展，我们两国在原料和产品方面可以互通有无，在生产的技术和经验方面可以互补短长”。
    进一步发展我国和印度尼西亚的贸易和技术合作，不仅有助于两国的经济建设和两国人民生活的提高，而且也是具体体现万隆会议关于加强亚非国家经济合作的决议的精神，它是符合于中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的利益的。
