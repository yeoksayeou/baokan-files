　　In autumn, a surveying team tasked with creating topographic maps for national defense arrived in Inner Mongolia. Here stands a high mountain, known locally as "Tianshan" (Heaven Mountain). To the east of the mountain lies an endless grassland; to the west lies a vast desert. The area surveyed by the team was located in the desert, more than a hundred kilometers away from Tianshan. The desert is filled with countless sand dunes, undulating like waves of a yellow ocean. The observation station was set up on a sand dune dozens of meters high, and the surveying soldiers' tents were also pitched here.

　　The surveying soldiers often got up earlier than the sun. In the early morning, when the sun was about to rise, the scene in the desert was magical: the distant peaks of Tianshan, usually visible, disappeared like a myth, replaced by colorful pavilions, tall chimneys of factories... beautiful scenery, ever-changing. After the sun rose high, all this disappeared again, as if an invisible hand had lifted up the original peaks, standing between the grassland and the desert. The surveying soldiers fully enjoyed the mirages they had heard of long ago and now witnessed with their own eyes.

　　There were no trees, no grass, and not even a small ditch in the desert. Water had to be carried from a very long distance, transported by horses or camels. Rice, flour, vegetables, meat... had to be bought from the grassland. Here, they were inextricably linked to the wind and sand. The hot wind in the desert was always blowing, and the sand rolled around. Even when there was no wind, countless fine sands flickered in the air. They hung the pieces of meat they bought from the grassland on the triangular frame of the sand dunes, fearing that if they were placed low, they would be covered with sand and impossible to eat, but this was useless. The fine sand floating in the air still covered the meat, impossible to wash clean. When stir-fried into a dish, it crunched in the mouth. When cooking rice on the sand dunes, no matter how tightly the lid was closed, sand still got into the pot. They always said while eating, "We're eating sand-fried meat slices, sand-steamed rice, it's both fragrant and chewy."

　　At night, the surveying soldiers slept on the sand, and fine sand grains filled their quilts, ears, and hair. The next morning, in addition to brushing their teeth and washing their faces, they had to pick their ears, pat their hair, and clean up the mischievous sand grains. Sometimes, when observing on the frames, the sand would also fly into their eyes. They had to rub it out before they could work.

　　There were no roads in the desert. As soon as you walked past, and looked back for the original path, your footprints had already been covered by the wind-blown sand. People unfamiliar with the desert, coming here for the first time, would easily lose their way if they encountered cloudy or rainy weather. If it was a sunny day, you could rely on the sun during the day and the Big Dipper at night to distinguish the directions.

　　One evening, the sky was full of dark clouds. Wang Jie, the deputy leader of the observation station, bought a lot of food from the grassland and was going to deliver it to the light station. In addition to the food, the horse also carried two bundles of grass (food for the horse). When entering the desert, it was already dark. Everything around was yellow, and the sky was dark. Which way to go? Wang Jie couldn't make up his mind for a moment. He led the horse, step by step, in the direction he thought was correct. Suddenly, the horse snorted "whoosh, whoosh." He looked back, "Oh dear!" Two big yellow wolves were tailing him thirty or forty meters behind. Wang Jie had heard that the wolves here were both cunning and fierce. They often attacked cattle and horse herds in packs. Single people often got hurt when encountering them. With the unique calmness of a soldier in danger, he tightened the reins and continued to lead the horse forward. Some people said that wolves were afraid of fire, but he didn't smoke, and he never carried matches with him. What to do? Let the wolves keep chasing? What if the wolves pounced...? He looked back. Another one was running from afar, making a total of three. "What if the wolf pack gathers?" He started to panic a little.

　　The grass on the horse's back fluttered in the wind. In this silent and uninhabited desert, it was creepy enough even without wolves. Suddenly, he had an idea. He pulled out an armful of grass from the horse's back and threw it high into the air. With a "whoosh" sound, the grass was scattered in the air by the wind. The wolves were stunned by this sudden scene and fled "swoosh, swoosh." Wang Jie groped in the dark for a long time and finally found the light station.

    生活在沙漠里的测绘兵
    叶遥
    秋天，一支测绘国防军用地形图的测绘队来到内蒙古。这里有座高山，当地人叫它“天山”。山的东面是一望无边的大草原；山的西面是大沙漠。测绘队观测的地区在大沙漠里，距天山一百多公里远。沙漠里有无数沙丘，起伏连绵，像黄色海洋的波浪一样。观测站就设在几十公尺高的沙丘上，测绘兵住宿的帐篷也搭在这里。
    测绘兵们，经常比太阳起来的早。清晨，当太阳将升未升的时候，沙漠里的景象是奇妙的：远处常见的天山峰峦像神话一样无影无踪了，代替它的是彩色缤纷的楼阁、工厂里的高大烟囱……奇丽美景，变化万千。太阳高高升起以后，这一切又不见了，像一只无形的大手，把原有的峰峦又托了出来，耸立在草原和沙漠之间。测绘兵们饱赏了过去早就听说过而现在亲自看到了的“海市蜃楼”奇景。
    沙漠里没有树木，没有青草，连一条小河沟也没有。吃水要跑很远很远，用马或骆驼驮运。米、面、青菜、肉类……得从草原上买来。在这里，他们和风沙结了不解之缘。沙漠里的热风总是不断吹着，沙子滚来滚去。就在没有风的时候，空中也闪烁着无数细沙。他们把从草原买来的肉块，悬挂在沙丘的三角标架上，怕放在低处吹满沙子没法吃，可是这也无用，空中飘浮的细沙照样沾满肉块，洗都洗不净，炒出菜来，放到嘴里咯吱咯吱响。在沙丘上焖饭，锅盖盖得再严实，沙子仍然往锅里钻。他们吃着饭菜，总爱说：“咱们吃的是沙子炒肉片，沙子焖米饭，又香甜，又耐嚼。”
    晚上，测绘兵睡在沙地上，被窝里、耳朵里、头发里都钻满了细沙粒。第二天起床，他们除去刷牙洗脸，还得掏掏耳朵，扑扑头发，清理一下顽皮的沙粒。有时在标架上进行观测，沙子也喜欢飞进眼里，他们得把它揉出来，才能工作。
    沙漠里是没有路的，你刚走过去，再回头找原路，你的脚印已经被风吹起的沙子掩没了。不熟悉沙漠的人，乍来到这里，如果遇上阴天或雨天，便很容易迷失方向。如果是晴天，白天还可以靠太阳，夜里可以靠北斗星辨别东西南北。
    一个傍晚，满天乌云。观测站的副组长王杰，从草原上买来不少吃的东西，要给司光站送去。马背上除去吃的，还驮着两捆青草（这是给马准备的吃粮）。进入沙漠的时候，天已经黑了，四周黄腾腾的，天空黑乌乌的，该往哪里走呢？王杰一时拿不定主意。他牵着马，一步一步向他认为正确的方向走去。忽然，马“呼呼”地打起了响鼻，他回头看看，“啊哟！”后面三、四十米远的地方，尾追着两只大黄狼。王杰听说过这里的狼既狡猾又凶猛，它们常常成群结队袭击牛群、马群。单身人遇到它们，常被伤害。他以军人遇险时的特有镇静，抓紧缰绳拉马仍往前走。有人说狼怕火，但他不会抽烟，平时身边总不带火柴。怎么办呢？让狼一直追着吗？万一狼扑上来……。他回头看看，从远处又跑来一只，一共三只了。“万一狼群大集合，怎么办？”他有点发慌了。
    马背上的草被风刮得忽闪忽闪，在这寂静无人的大沙漠里，就是没有狼，也够毛骨悚然了。忽然，他灵机一动，从马背上抽出一抱草，高高抛到空中，“唰”的一声，草被风刮散在空中。狼被这突如其来的景象吓昏了，“嗖嗖”地逃了去。王杰在黑夜里摸了很久，终于找到司光站。
