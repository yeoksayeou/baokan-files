Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang - More than 900,000 mu of "Dai Zi Cotton" in Jiangxi Province have reported bumper harvests. In the main cotton-producing areas along the Yangtze River and on the shores of Poyang Lake, the current yield of picked cotton generally reaches more than 40 to 50 jin (lint) per mu. Many large-scale high-yield cotton fields have emerged. In the Jiangbei cotton area of ​​Pengze County, along the Yangtze River, 28,900 mu of cotton fields have an average yield of 100 jin of lint per mu. The Jiangxin Agricultural Cooperative in this area harvested more than 120 jin of lint per mu on 4,500 mu of cotton. In the new cotton areas in some mountainous and hilly areas, such as Xin'gan, Ji'an, and Linchuan counties, cotton has also achieved very high yields.
According to the current cotton harvest, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture estimates that the average yield per unit area (lint) of "Dai Zi Cotton" in the province this year can reach about 45 jin, an increase of more than 60% compared with last year.
Jiangxi cotton area's "Dai Zi Cotton" has long fibers, strong tensile strength, and pure white color. It is a very good cotton for the textile industry. This cotton area has been developed through multiple trials since liberation. Before liberation, Jiangxi rarely grew cotton, and there was no "Dai Zi Cotton" at all. This year, the planting area of "Dai Zi Cotton" has expanded by more than 360,000 mu compared with last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanyang - Nanyang Special District of Henan Province, which has always had low cotton production, has achieved an unprecedented cotton harvest this year. The expected yield per unit area of cotton in the entire special district will be more than double that of last year. In Xinye, Deng County, Tanghe, and Nanyang counties, where the cotton field area is more concentrated, the average yield of 850,000 mu of cotton fields is more than 32 jin of lint per mu. The Wuyi Agricultural Cooperative in Dongtang Township, Xichuan County, has harvested 538 mu of wheat-ridge cotton three times, and it is expected to yield 64 jin of lint per mu.
Before agricultural cooperativization, cotton planting in Nanyang Special District was scattered and extensive, and the yield per mu had always been maintained at around 12 jin of lint. This year, after the realization of agricultural cooperativization, the cotton field planning work was first carried out in accordance with local conditions, expanding the area of good land for cotton planting. Secondly, the native cotton was completely replaced with improved varieties such as Dai Zi Cotton, and the comprehensive cotton large-area high-yield experience of early sowing, dense planting, and field management in Xinjiang was conscientiously promoted. The cotton area has also equipped cotton full-time cadres at all levels, and trained more than 153,000 cotton technicians through civil schools and technical teaching networks. In the spring, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Henan Provincial People's Committee also organized a cotton technical guidance group of more than 200 people from the old cotton areas of Anyang, Luoyang, and Kaifeng special districts to be stationed in Nanyang Special District to help with the work. The average yield of more than 146,000 mu of cotton fields directly guided by the guidance group increased by about 50% compared with ordinary cotton fields.

    江西省和河南省的南阳专区
    棉花普告丰收
    据新华社南昌电　江西省九十多万亩“岱字棉”普告丰收。在主要棉产区的长江沿岸和鄱阳湖滨地区，现在已采摘的棉花每亩产量一般都达到四十斤到五十斤（皮棉）以上，并且出现了许多大面积高额丰产棉田。沿长江的彭泽县江北棉区，二万八千九百亩棉田，平均每亩收皮棉一百斤。这个地区的江心农业社种的四千五百亩棉花每亩皮棉产量达到一百二十多斤。在一些山区丘陵区的新棉区，如新淦、吉安、临州等县，棉花也都获得很高的收成。
    根据目前棉花收获的情况，江西省农业厅估计，今年全省“岱字棉”平均单位面积产量（皮棉）可达四十五斤左右，比去年增产六成多。
    江西棉区的“岱字棉”纤维长、拉力强、色泽洁白，是很好的纺织工业用棉。这个棉区是解放以后经过多次试种发展起来的。解放前江西很少种棉花，根本没有“岱字棉”，今年“岱字棉”种植面积较去年扩大了三十六万多亩。
    据新华社南阳电　河南省一向棉花产量低的南阳专区，今年棉花空前丰收。全专区棉花单位面积产量预计将比去年提高一倍以上。棉田面积较集中的新野、邓县、唐河和南阳等县，八十五万亩棉田平均每亩可收皮棉三十二斤多。淅川县东堂乡五一农业社五百三十八亩麦垄花，目前已经收摘三遍，预计每亩将收皮棉六十四斤。
    南阳专区在农业合作化以前，棉花种值零星分散，耕作粗放，历年每亩产量只维持在皮棉十二斤上下。今年，实现农业合作化以后，首先因地制宜地进行了棉田规划工作，扩大了好地植棉面积；其次全面地把土种棉更换为岱字棉等良种，并且认真地推行了新疆的早播、密植和田间管理等综合性的棉花大面积丰产经验。棉区还逐级配备了棉花专职干部，通过民校和技术传授网等形式培养训练了棉花技术员十五万三千多人。中共河南省委员会和河南省人民委员会春季并且从老棉区安阳、洛阳、开封三个专区组织二百多人的棉花技术辅导团，派驻南阳专区帮助工作。在辅导团直接辅导下的十四万六千多亩棉田，平均产量约比一般棉田增加五成。
