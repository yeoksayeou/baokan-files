    Supporting the Construction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    Yang Zhilin, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    The various construction projects currently underway in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and those about to commence, are located in agricultural, pastoral, forestry, and mountainous areas. These projects are characterized by urgent tasks, large scales, and rapid progress. The population is also increasing rapidly along with construction. For example, the basic construction task in Baotou was 500,000 square meters in 1955, but this year it is 1.1 to 1.2 million square meters. The population was less than 80,000 in 1950, but now it has reached 300,000. The forestry industry's logging volume was 590,000 cubic meters in 1952, and this year it has increased to 1.7 million cubic meters (equivalent in value to 1.7 million tons of grain). In 1952, the population along the Yalin forest railway in the forest area was less than 20,000, but now it exceeds 100,000. The development of other areas, such as state-owned ranches, fishing grounds, and more than 40 prospecting and drilling areas of various sizes, as well as newly built towns and areas along newly built railways, is generally the same. Because the local infrastructure is weak, there are many difficulties in work and life, and they are becoming more and more serious every day. For example, regarding the living supplies of employees, the annual grain supply alone is about 70,000 tons, and tens of millions of catties of vegetables are needed in the forest areas north of the Greater Khingan Mountains, pastoral areas, and grassland forest cities such as Manzhouli, Hailar, and Yakeshi. Basic construction in various places requires the local industry to produce large quantities of building materials such as bricks, tiles, sand, stones, and lime. Employees' housing is insufficient. Other issues include education, health, cultural entertainment, wages, welfare, prices, and transportation. If these problems cannot be solved quickly, they will directly affect the progress of construction.
    We have shortcomings and even mistakes in leading the construction work, but the relevant central departments also lack comprehensive planning and specific measures in supporting and cooperating with us. In order to change this situation, we hope that the relevant leading departments of the central government will attach importance to the construction of the Inner Mongolia region ideologically, provide necessary education to their subordinate cadres in their work, and actively provide practical assistance.
    We hope that the central departments will formulate a comprehensive support plan for key construction and new construction areas, take specific cooperative measures, and stipulate a supervision and inspection system to ensure that the support work produces practical results.
    In terms of various appropriations, some central departments believe that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has great financial flexibility, so they let the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region solve things that they should pay for themselves. In fact, the income of Inner Mongolia is limited, and it has been arranged according to the unified national plan at the beginning of each year, and there is no extra flexibility. For example, this year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region invested 90% of its urban construction funds in Baotou, and other regions have a lot of opinions because they received too little funding, and Baotou still feels it is too little. Therefore, it is recommended that the urban construction funds for Baotou and the construction funds for the forest area (the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area has at least 900 million cubic meters of timber reserves, and 7 million cubic meters can be harvested annually in a few years) be allocated separately by the central government and not included in the local budget. Other new construction areas also require corresponding construction support for commerce, education, health, transportation, postal and telecommunications, and banks. We hope that the relevant central departments will consider the actual difficulties of Inner Mongolia and give appropriate consideration to the construction of new areas when controlling appropriation indicators.
    Many work departments of the central government rarely contact Inner Mongolia and have not told us the construction scale and progress of some key factories and mines in time. This makes it difficult for us to cooperate and make comprehensive arrangements, and the work is very passive and causes great losses. In the future, in addition to our active contact, we hope that the central government will have clear regulations on this.
    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is very vast. In addition to ethnic characteristics, it also has many regional characteristics. It has changed greatly in recent years, and the situation is complex. It is necessary to guide the work according to the specific situation. The current practices of some departments clearly do not understand the specific situation. For example, a certain ministry allocated 70 million yuan of welfare funds this year, but only gave Inner Mongolia 200,000 yuan. When allocating woolen fabrics, only 200 meters were allocated to the entire Inner Mongolia. The Greater Khingan Mountains are already cold in September, and winter clothing was not allocated until October. This year, when the forest fire was most tense, it was impossible to instruct work by calling Hailar from Hohhot because the Qiqihar line was closed at 8 pm, saying that it was stipulated by the higher authorities. We hope that the relevant central departments will send more people to Inner Mongolia in the future, go deep down, and directly investigate and study and understand the situation to help our work.

### 支援内蒙古自治区的建设

    支援内蒙古自治区的建设
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会书记　杨植霖
    内蒙古自治区目前正在进行的各种建设项目和即将投入建设的工程，在农区、牧区、林区、山区都有。这些工程的任务急、规模大、速度快。人口也随着建设迅速增加。如包头市一九五五年基本建设任务五十万平方公尺，今年就是一百几十万平方公尺；一九五○年人口不足八万，现在已经到三十万。森林工业一九五二年的采伐量是五十九万立方公尺，今年已经增到一百七十万立方公尺（价值等于一百七十万吨粮食）；一九五二年森林铁路的牙林沿线人口不足两万，现在已经超过十万。其他还有国营牧场、渔场和大小四十多个勘察、钻探地区，以及新建的城镇、新建铁路通过的地方等，这些地区的发展情况也大体相同。因为当地基础薄弱，工作上生活上都有不少困难，而且一天比一天严重。例如，职工的生活供应，仅大兴安岭以北的林区、牧区和草原森林城市满州里、海拉尔、牙克石等，除百货日用品外，仅粮食年需供应约七万吨，蔬菜数千万斤；各地基本建设都要求地方工业大量生产砖、瓦、砂子、石头、石灰等建筑材料；职工的住宅不够；其它教育、卫生、文化娱乐、工资、福利、物价、交通等都有一些问题。这些问题如不能很快解决，就会直接影响建设进度。
    我们在领导建设工作上是有缺点甚至错误的，但是中央有关部门在支援配合上也缺乏全面规划和具体措施。为改变这一状况，我们希望中央有关领导部门从思想上重视内蒙古地区的建设，在工作中给所属干部以必要的教育，主动积极地给以实际援助。
    我们希望中央各部门定出重点建设和新建设区的全面支援计划，采取具体配合措施，并且规定监督检查制度，使支援工作产生出实际效果。
    在各种拨款上，中央有些部门认为内蒙古自治区财权机动大，因此把应该自己出钱办的事也让内蒙古自治区解决，其实内蒙古的收入是有限的，而且在每年年初都按照国家统一计划作了安排，已经没有多余的机动力量。如今年内蒙古自治区把全部城市建设费的百分之九十投在包头，别的地区因得款太少意见很多，而包头还嫌太少。因此，建议把包头的城市建设费和林区的建设费（大兴安岭林区蓄材至少有九亿立方公尺，几年后可年采伐七百万立方公尺）由中央另拨专款去办，不列入地方预算。其他新建设区也都要求商业、教育、卫生、交通、邮电、银行等有相应的配合建设。我们希望中央有关部门在控制拨款指标的时候，考虑内蒙古的实际困难，给新区建设以适当照顾。
    中央好些工作部门很少和内蒙古联系，没有及早地把一些重点厂矿的建设规模和进度告诉我们，这样我们既不好配合，也难全面安排，工作十分被动，损失很大。今后除我们主动联系外，希望中央对此有明确规定。
    内蒙古自治区十分辽阔，除民族特点外，还有很多地区特点，近年来变化很大，情况复杂，必须根据具体情况指导工作。现在有些部门的做法，显然是不了解具体情况的。如某部今年分配七千万元的福利费，只给了内蒙古二十万元；在分配呢绒货源的时候全内蒙古只分配给二百公尺；大兴安岭九月已冷，十月才拨去冬用衣物。今年林区起火最紧张时，由呼和浩特给海拉尔打电话打不通，不能指示工作，因为齐齐哈尔一线晚八时即封闭电话，说是上级规定的。我们希望中央有关部门，今后多派人去内蒙古，深入下去，直接调查研究和了解情况，以帮助我们的工作。
