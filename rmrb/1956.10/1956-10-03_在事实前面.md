    In the Face of Facts
    Yue Zimian
    Just as many teachers were applying to universities, I asked clerk Huang of the Culture and Education Section:
    Why wasn't I accepted?
    Huang: Who knows? It must have been the admissions work group who messed it up.
    I called the admissions work group and learned that this wasn't the case.
    Huang: That's strange! --Ah! (He patted his head, trying hard to think) Maybe it was the Culture and Education Bureau! Yes, yes, it must be!
    I called the Culture and Education Bureau to ask for an explanation as to why my application wasn't accepted. I immediately received a reply that they hadn't screened anyone out. So I looked at Huang questioningly.
    Huang: ...!? (Stared blankly for a long time) To be honest, your level is not high enough! ... For example, how can you prove that you have the level of a secondary normal school graduate?
    I said I had completed all the courses through self-study.
    Huang: If self-study could work, why would we even bother with schools? Ha! Ha! There's nothing to say! Since you didn't graduate from a secondary normal school, you shouldn't have applied to universities.
    With that, he hurried off to the countryside.
            ×××
    A month later, I handed Huang a letter of introduction: ... has been accepted... please process my departure procedures.
    Huang: Who approved you?
    I said it was Section Chief Nan and Old Lin from the Education Bureau.
    Clerk Huang was stunned, his lips moved a few times in a smile that wasn't a smile--he didn't say a word, his face turned red.

    在事实前面
    岳自勉
    正当许多教师报考高等学校的时候，我去问文教科黄科员：
    我为什么没报上名？
    黄：鬼知道：反正是招生工作组给搞的。
    我用电话问过招生工作组，知道并无此事。
    黄：这就奇怪了！——啊！（他拍着脑袋尽力地想着）大概是文教局吧！是，是，一定是！
    我又用电话要文教局解释一下未报上名的原因。立刻得到回答，他们并没有审查掉人。于是我用疑问的眼光询问黄。
    黄：……！？（呆了好一会儿）说实在，你的程度不够呀！……比方说，你拿什么证明你具有中等师范毕业水平呢？
    我说自修完了所有的功课。
    黄：如果自学能成的话，还何必办学校呢？哈！哈！没有什么说的！你既然没有中等师范毕业，就不应当提出报考高等学校的要求。
    说罢他匆匆下乡去了。
            ×××
    一个月后，我将一封介绍信递给黄：……已被录取……请办理离职手续。
    黄：谁批准你的？
    我说是南科长和教育局老林。
    黄科员一愣，嘴唇似笑非笑地动了几下，——话没说出来，脸红了。
