To commemorate the 90th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth, "Selected Works of Sun Yat-sen" will be published in Beijing in November.

Sun Yat-sen was a great democratic revolutionary in modern China who devoted his life to the revolution and produced many important works. The works included in the "Selected Works of Sun Yat-sen" represent Sun Yat-sen's main ideas in various periods of his life.

The "Selected Works of Sun Yat-sen" is divided into two volumes, totaling more than 700,000 words. The first volume includes Sun Yat-sen's works before the reorganization of the Kuomintang in 1923, and the second volume includes works from the period of the Kuomintang reorganization and thereafter. The selection includes important documents and treatises from the period of the establishment of the Revive China Society and the Tongmenghui, important treatises from the Xinhai Revolution period and after, as well as important documents after the Kuomintang reorganization, such as the "Manifesto of the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang." Most of Sun Yat-sen's works, such as "The Fundamentals of National Reconstruction," "The General Outline of National Reconstruction," and "The Three Principles of the People," are also included. The selection also includes some important articles and letters that have not been published in the past, such as the full text of "The True Solution of the Chinese Question," "Telegram on Lenin's Death," and "Letter to Inukai Tsuyoshi."

The various versions of Sun Yat-sen's collected works published during the Kuomintang's rule had many errors and omissions in compilation and proofreading, and no version can be used as a basis. Therefore, when the "Selected Works of Sun Yat-sen" was revised, only a relatively reliable version could be selected as the main basis according to the specific circumstances of each work, and then revised with reference to other versions. Whenever it was possible to find a photographic reproduction of the original manuscript or the first published article, it was collated or retranslated according to the photographic reproduction of the original manuscript or the first publication. For example, "The True Solution of the Chinese Question" was completely retranslated according to the English original manuscript of the "Complete Works of the Premier" published by Shanghai Minzhi Book Company in 1930; "Telegram on Lenin's Death" was retranslated according to the original manuscript; the article "'Min Bao' Inaugural Address" was collated according to the existing first issue of "Min Bao"; and "Manuscript Letter to Chiang Kai-shek" was collated according to the 1926 edition of "Sun Yat-sen's Handwritten Manuscripts" published by the Pacific Society.

The front of this selected collection includes photographs of Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary activities in various periods and some of his manuscripts. The cover is inscribed by Soong Ching Ling.

The "Complete Works of Sun Yat-sen" is also currently being edited.

    纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年
    “孙中山选集”11月出版
    本报讯　为纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年，“孙中山选集”将于11月间在北京出版。
    孙中山先生是我国近代伟大的民主主义革命家，一生献身革命，并且有许多重要著作。“孙中山选集”所收的著作，代表了孙先生一生在各个时期的主要思想。
      “孙中山选集”分为上下两卷，共约七十多万字。上卷选入的是孙先生在1923年国民党改组以前时期的著作，下卷选入的是国民党改组时期和改组以后的著作。选集包括了兴中会和同盟会建立时期的一些重要文件和论著，辛亥革命时期，辛亥革命以后的重要论著，以及国民党改组以后的重要文件“中国国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言”，孙先生的大部著作如“建国方略”、“建国大纲”、“三民主义”等也收在里面。选集还收进了一些过去没有发表过的重要文章和函电，如“中国问题的真解决”的全文、“列宁逝世电文”、“致犬养毅书”等。
    国民党统治时期刊印的各种版本的孙中山文集，在编排和校对方面都有很多错漏，没有一种版本可以作为根据。因此，“孙中山选集”在进行校订的时候，只能按照各篇著作的具体情况选定一种比较可靠的版本作为主要依据，再参照其他版本校订。凡是能够找到影印原稿或者最初刊印的文章，就按影印原稿或最初印行的校订或重译，例如“中国问题的真解决”是按照上海民智书局1930年“总理全集”影印的英文原稿全部重译的；“列宁逝世电文”是按原稿重译的；“‘民报’发刊词”一文是按现存的“民报”第一号校订的；“致蒋介石手札”是按太平洋学社1926年版的“孙中山先生手札墨迹”校订的。
    这本选集的卷首印有孙先生在各个时期进行革命活动的照片和一些手迹，封面由宋庆龄先生亲笔题字。
      “孙中山全集”最近也在进行编辑中。
