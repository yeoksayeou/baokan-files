Xinhua News Agency, October 15th: The state-owned Beijing Electronic Tube Factory held a commencement ceremony and celebration meeting today.

Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun said at the meeting that in order to realize socialist industrialization in our country, we must actively establish and develop the radio industry. He said: The successful construction of the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory has created a good beginning for the development of our radio industry. There is an old saying in our country: "The beginning of everything is difficult." Now that we have made a start, built the first modern electronic tube factory, and built it well with the help of the Soviet Union, we don't have to worry about building a series of radio factories in a fairly long period of time in the future, and overcoming the backward state of our radio industry.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun said that the radio industry occupies an extremely important position in modern industry. All modern industries cannot be separated from the radio industry, and its high development is an important result of the development of modern science and technology to a new stage. However, it can be said that our country originally had almost no radio industry.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun finally pointed out: The future task of the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory is not only to quickly master production technology and produce a large number of diverse electronic tubes, but also to cultivate a large number of technical talents and create various technical conditions for the construction of other electronic tube factories in the future.

When Vice Premier Li Fuchun spoke, he congratulated the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory on its commencement of production, and on behalf of the State Council, he expressed heartfelt thanks to the Soviet government for providing comprehensive assistance to our country in building this factory.

A delegation from the Soviet Ministry of Radio Technology Industry, headed by Soviet Deputy Minister of Radio Technology Industry Zakharov, attended the commencement ceremony and celebration meeting.

Responsible personnel from many departments of the Central Government and Beijing Municipality came to offer their congratulations today. Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Chen Peng, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, also spoke at the meeting.

Then, the director of the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory spoke, saying that we must strive to overcome the difficulties that may be encountered in the mass production of electronic tubes, conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, trial-produce more and more complex new products, master advanced technology, and catch up with the world's advanced levels.

The director of the National Acceptance Committee announced the acceptance conclusion at the meeting. The National Acceptance Committee believes that the overall project quality of the entire factory is rated as excellent; all projects have been able to meet the needs of commencement of production.

Finally, Vice Premier Li Fuchun cut the red ribbon amid the sound of music. Accompanied by the factory director and chief engineer, Vice Premier Li and members of the Soviet Ministry of Radio Technology Industry delegation, as well as guests, visited the factory.

At exactly 2:00 PM, all the machines and conveyor belts in all workshops of the factory started running simultaneously. The auto parts and assemblies processed by the auto workers distributed on the various assembly lines continuously converged to the final assembly workshop. Brand new "Liberation" brand cars were driven out one after another from the end of the final assembly line.

The commencement ceremony, attended by more than 20,000 employees and their families, was held on the square in front of the factory building. On the factory gate, a banner was hung with the slogan: "Glory belongs to the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party." Guests from all over the country who came to attend the ceremony celebrated with the employees the on-schedule completion of China's first automobile industrial base and celebrated the history of our people creating China's own automobiles with their own labor under the assistance of the Soviet Union.

Huang Jing, Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, pointed out at the commencement ceremony that the completion and commissioning of the First Automobile Factory will bring China's machine building industry to a new technical level. In his speech, Huang Jing thanked the Soviet Union for its comprehensive assistance to the factory, thanked the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, the support of the people of the whole country, and the leadership and support of the local party and government leading organs. He said: The Soviet government and people, in the process of the factory's construction and trial production, not only provided the factory with factory design, equipment and complete technical data, but also sent more than 180 outstanding experts, and also trained a large number of cadres and workers. Huang Jing called on all the employees of the factory to continue to learn from Soviet experts, and to better cooperate with brother factories to produce a large number of high-quality and inexpensive cars for the country.

V. Ya. Silifanov, head of the Soviet delegation and Deputy Minister of the Soviet Automobile Industry, who was invited to attend the commencement ceremony of the First Automobile Factory, expressed warm congratulations on the birth of China's first automobile industrial base. Silifanov said: The First Automobile Factory, equipped with modern technology, has now become an advanced enterprise in the People's Republic of China. In the future, it will not only be able to continuously produce a large number of cars, but also, due to the diversity of truck production technology and the mass production, this factory will also become a good school for Chinese workers to learn production technology.

A. G.

    新华社15日讯　国营北京电子管厂今天举行开工典礼庆祝大会。
    国务院副总理李富春在会上说，为了在我国实现社会主义工业化，我们必须积极地建立和发展无线电工业。他说：北京电子管厂的建设成功，就为我国无线电工业的发展创立了一个良好的开端。我国有句老话：万事起头难。我们既然开了头，建立起了第一座现代化的电子管厂，并且在苏联帮助下建设得很好，我们就不愁在今后的一个相当长的时间内，建立起一系列的无线电工厂，克服我国无线电工业的落后状态。
    李富春副总理说，无线电工业在现代工业中占有极其重要的地位。一切现代化的工业都不能离开无线电工业，它的高度发展是现代科学技术发展到新的阶段的一个重要结果。而我国原来可以说几乎没有无线电工业。
    李富春副总理最后指出：北京电子管厂今后的任务，不仅要迅速地掌握生产技术，生产出大量的多种多样的电子管，而且要为今后建设其它的电子管厂培养大批的技术人材和创造各种技术条件。
