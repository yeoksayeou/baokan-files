    Why Not Accept These Fat Pigs
    The Shengli Agricultural Cooperative in Yubei Township, Wucun District, Qufu County, Shandong Province, raised over a thousand pigs this year. By early August, seventy of them had been fattened. The cooperative members hoped to sell the pigs to the state as soon as possible, both to supply food to urban and rural people and because the cooperative urgently needed money to purchase seeds and fertilizer for autumn planting. However, the local food company was only willing to buy twelve pigs, refusing the remaining fifty-eight, citing reasons such as "poor coat color" and "not smooth-skinned." In fact, these fifty-eight pigs all weighed around 140 *jin* (about 70 kg), and none of them failed to meet the purchasing standards. When purchasing live pigs, should the "coat color" be the standard, or the weight? This kind of operational style that makes things difficult for farmers is unacceptable.

### 为什么不收这些肥猪

    为什么不收这些肥猪
    山东曲阜县吴村区峪北乡胜利农业合作社，今年养了一千多头猪。到今年8月上旬，已有七十头喂肥了。社员们希望早日把猪卖给国家，既可以供应城乡人民食用，社里又急需用钱购买秋种的种籽和肥料。但是当地食品公司只肯收购十二头猪，其余的五十八头不收，理由是：“毛色不好”，“长的不光滑”。其实，这五十八头猪都是一百四十斤左右重，没有一头是不够收购标准的。收购生猪的规格，究竟是看“毛色”，还是按斤量？这种刁难农民的经营作风要不得。
