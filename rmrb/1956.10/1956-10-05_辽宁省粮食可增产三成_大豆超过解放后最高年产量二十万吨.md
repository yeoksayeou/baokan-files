Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Telegram: Liaoning Province has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. It is estimated that the total grain output of the province will reach eight million tons, an increase of 30% compared to last year. Currently, over four million hectares of late autumn crops are generally mature, and the intense autumn harvesting work has fully begun. In various regions, early-maturing millet and foxtail millet have been harvested, and sorghum and corn are in the stage of intense harvesting. Rice and soybeans will also begin harvesting soon.

In response to the characteristics of this year's land consolidation, concentrated crop maturity, and large dense planting areas, which make harvesting labor-intensive, agricultural cooperatives in various regions have generally rationally adjusted labor organization, revised labor quotas, and formulated comprehensive autumn harvest plans and labor plans. The Daxing Agricultural Cooperative in Changtu County implemented an autumn harvest management method of "group contracting sections, household contracting plots" (fixing autumn harvest areas to groups and then contracting them to members according to labor force and land conditions to establish a personal responsibility system for field production). This not only further enhanced the sense of responsibility of each member but also improved labor utilization and overcame the phenomenon of idling and waste.

During the autumn harvest, agricultural cooperatives in various regions generally put forward the slogan "Avoid losses and waste, strive for every grain to enter the granary" and more deeply carried out labor competitions to increase production and ensure harvest. Agricultural cooperatives in Tieling County are striving to achieve harvesting, transporting, threshing, and distributing as soon as crops are ripe; clean harvesting, bundling, picking, threshing, winnowing, and threshing ground; fire prevention, theft prevention, disaster prevention, and protection of crops in the fields and threshing grounds, striving for another six million catties of grain. In the Lüda area, 20% of the millet is harvested by pinching the ears and then threshing, which not only yields more grain but also reduces straw loss. In Xingcheng County, the Democratic, Patriotic, Revival, and Weiping Agricultural Cooperatives threshed the already threshed millet again, harvesting more than 2,500 catties of millet and more than forty *shi* of chaff.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd: Liaoning Province, one of the main soybean-producing areas in Northeast China, has seen its planted 720,000-plus hectares of soybeans generally ripen and harvesting has begun. According to estimates by the Liaoning Provincial Statistics Bureau, the average yield per hectare is 2,500 *jin* of soybeans, an increase of over 44% compared to last year. The total output may exceed the highest post-liberation output of 1954 by 200,000 tons.

This year, the soybean planting area in Liaoning Province increased by more than 110,000 hectares compared to last year, and soybean cultivation techniques and field management have also been significantly improved compared to previous years. In the province, 350,000 hectares of soybeans were inoculated with rhizobium, an expansion of more than 150,000 hectares compared to last year. In the past, farmers in the Liaoning area were accustomed to planting soybeans by dibbling or hoeing, causing the soybean plants to be crowded together with few branches and few pods. This year, most intercropped and monocropped soybean fields generally adopted the method of "thinning the rows" for sowing and artificial thinning, resulting in relatively sparse plant spacing, and the pod-setting rate has generally increased by about 20% compared to the past. The habit of not applying fertilizer to soybean fields has also changed this year. In major soybean-producing areas, many agricultural cooperatives have also adopted the new technique of pinching the top buds during the soybean pod-setting period.

### 辽宁省粮食可增产三成  大豆超过解放后最高年产量二十万吨

    辽宁省粮食可增产三成
    大豆超过解放后最高年产量二十万吨
    新华社沈阳电　辽宁省今年获得空前丰收，估计今年全省粮食总产量将达到八百万吨，比去年可以增产30％。目前全省四百多万公顷大秋作物普遍成熟，紧张的秋收工作已经全面展开。各地早熟的糜子、谷子已经割完上场，高粱、玉米正处在紧张收割的阶段，水稻、大豆也很快就可以开始收割。
    根据今年土地连片，作物成熟集中，密植面积大，因而收割费工的特点，各地农业社在秋收中普遍合理地调整了劳动组织、修定了劳动定额，制定了全面的秋收计划和劳动规划。昌图县大兴农业社实行“组包片、户包块”的秋收管理方法（把秋收地段固定到小组，再按劳动力、土地条件包给社员，建立田间生产的个人负责制）以后，不但进一步提高了每个社员的责任心，而且提高了劳动利用率，克服了窝工浪费现象。
    在秋收中，各地农业社普遍提出“避免损失浪费，争取颗粒入仓”的口号，更加深入地开展了增产保收的劳动竞赛。铁岭县的农业社正在努力做到随熟随割、随拉、随打、随分，割净、拤净、拣净、打净、扬净、场院净，防火、防盗、防灾和护青、护场院，争取再增产六百万斤粮食。旅大地区有20％的谷子是掐穗下来后打的，这样既多出粮，又少损失草。兴城县民主、爱国、复国、围屏等四个农业社把已经打过的糜子又打了一遍，多收了二千五百多斤糜子和四十多石秕花。
    新华社沈阳2日电　我国东北大豆主要产区之一的辽宁省，今年种植的七十二万多公顷大豆，已经普遍成熟，开始收割。据辽宁省统计局估计，平均每公顷可产大豆两千五百斤，比去年增产44％以上。总产量可超过解放后产量最高的1954年二十万吨。
    今年辽宁省的大豆播种面积比去年增加了十一万多公顷，大豆的栽培技术和田间管理也比往年有了显著改进。全省用根瘤菌接种的大豆有三十五万公顷，比去年扩大了十五万多公顷。过去辽宁地区的农民种大豆习惯点撮苗或用锄头开苗，豆棵挤堆，扩杈少、结荚不多，今年大部分间作和单作的大豆地，一般都采用了“拉拉稀”播种和人工间苗的方法，植株稀密相当，结荚率一般都比过去增加20％左右。豆地不上粪的习惯，今年也有了改变。在大豆主要产区，许多农业社在大豆结荚期还采用了掐顶尖的新技术。
