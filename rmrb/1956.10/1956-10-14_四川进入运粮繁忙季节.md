Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 11th. Sichuan's grain supply area has spread to twenty provinces and cities across the country. This year's Sichuan grain transfer task has increased by 21% compared to last year.

Currently, Sichuan Province has entered another busy season of grain transportation. On the Sichuan River, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, and the Sichuan-Shaanxi, Sichuan-Yunnan, Sichuan-Guizhou, and Sichuan-Tibet highways, most of the vehicles and ships going downstream are fully loaded with grain. Prior to this, in September, the Sichuan Provincial Grain Department, under the extremely tight transportation situation inside and outside the province, rushed to transport more than 133,000 tons of wheat, broad beans, and other seeds to supply eight provinces including Anhui and Jiangsu.

Within the province, grain and transportation departments in various places are stepping up the collection and transportation of surplus grain. Chongqing Port, the largest distribution center, and Guangyuan Station on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, have seen a doubling of the daily grain arrival volume compared to normal in recent days. Currently, dozens of grain unloading docks along the Yangtze River in Chongqing and the granaries near the Baoji-Chengdu Railway are full of grain. Thousands of wooden boats navigating the inland rivers of Sichuan are also participating in grain transportation. Chongqing Station dispatches freight cars to load grain every day. At various grain transfer stations in Chengdu and Wenjiang, a constant stream of grain transporting people can be seen from the warehouses to the stations.

    四川进入运粮繁忙季节
    新华社成都11日电　川粮的供应地区已遍及全国二十个省、市。今年川粮外调任务比去年增加了21％。
    目前，四川省又进入运粮繁忙季节，在川江、宝成铁路，以及川陕、川滇、川黔、川藏等公路上，大部分下行的车、船都满载着粮食。在此以前，9月份，四川省粮食部门在省内外运输十分紧张的情况下，曾赶运十三万三千多吨小麦、蚕豆等种子供应安徽、江苏等八个省。
    在省内，各地粮食和交通运输部门正在加紧集运余粮。最大的集散地重庆港和宝成铁路线上的广元站，在最近几天中，每天运到的粮食比平时倍增。现在重庆沿江的几十个卸粮码头和宝成铁路附近的粮仓已满堆粮食。在四川内河航行的成千上万只木船也都参加了运粮。重庆车站每天都开到有装运粮食的车皮。成都、温江的各个粮食转运站，从仓库到车站可以看到川流不息的运粮人群。
