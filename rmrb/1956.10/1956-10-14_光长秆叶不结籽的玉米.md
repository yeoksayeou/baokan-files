    Corn with Tall Stalks and Leaves But No Kernels
    One day, I returned to my hometown of Qingyuan County from Baoding. I met some fellow villagers who were coming to the city. As soon as they left the south gate, they began to curse while looking at the crops along the road. One old man grabbed my arm and pulled me to the side of the road, pointing to the corn in the field and saying, "Look at this mess! How can we get grain from this!"
    "What's wrong? It looks good," I said casually, looking at the stalks that were as tall as a house.
    "What? Looks good! Take a look at these stalks and leaves and the ears of corn!" He pointed to the stalks that were only slightly thicker than a thumb and the yellowing leaves. He also peeled open an ear of corn with only a dozen or so kernels, pointing out the distance between two corn plants for me to see. It turned out the seedlings were too dense; the stalks were as tall as a house, but the distance between each plant was only a little over half a foot.
    It is said that in order to increase production, each mu (unit of area) must be densely planted to a prescribed number. If the masses are unwilling, a label of being "stubborn" or "backward" will be slapped on your head. The arm cannot twist the thigh, and the peasants had no choice but to obey.
    In an agricultural cooperative in Biyang Township, there was a production team leader who outwardly accepted the instructions from above, but secretly told his team members to leave the corn seedlings according to their own experience. After this matter was discovered, the cooperative cadres, township cadres, and even district cadres took turns firing at him, with some "persuading and educating," and others throwing tantrums, all the way into the night.
    Now, outside the village of Biyangcheng, only the corn in this team is thick and strong, with each plant bearing two or three foot-long ears. The cooperative cadres lower their heads and walk by whenever they pass this field.

### 光长秆叶不结籽的玉米

    光长秆叶不结籽的玉米
    一天，我从保定回到家乡清苑县，遇见几个进城来的同乡，一出南关，他们看着路旁的庄稼，就骂起来了。其中一个老汉一把抓住我的膀子，拉到路旁，指着地里的玉米说：“你看，这成个什么样子，凭什么打粮食！”
    “怎么啦？不错呀。”我看着一房高的秸子，顺口说。
    “什么？不错！你看看这秸儿叶儿和棒子！”他指着那些比拇指稍粗点的秸子和发黄的叶子。还剥了一个只有十几颗籽粒的玉米，指着两棵玉米之间的距离让我看。原来苗太稠了，一房高的秸子，棵与棵之间的距离只半尺多。
    据说是为了增产，每亩一定得密植到规定的数目，群众不愿意，“顽固”、“落后”的帽子就会戴到你的头上来。胳膀拧不过大腿，农民只好遵命照办。
    壁阳城乡的农业社有个生产队长，他明着接受上级指示，暗地里却叫队员按照他们自己的经验留下了玉米苗，这件事情被发觉以后，社干部、乡干部、直到区干部轮番向他开了火，有“说服教育”的，也有大发雷霆的，一直闹到深夜。
  现在呢，在壁阳城的村外，独有这个队的玉米棵棵又粗又壮，每棵上长着两个或三个一尺长的棒子。社干部们每路过这块地，都低下头走。
