Xinhua News Agency, 5th Dispatch, TASS dispatch: At the British Labour Party Annual Conference on October 4th, the Executive Committee member of the party, Mr. Delepe, submitted the last programmatic document drafted by the Executive Committee for discussion.

The drafters of the program brushed aside the issue of economic enslavement of colonies by British capital, and instead regarded "establishing democratic societies in the colonies" as the Labour Party's main goal. The program did not mention major issues such as the right to national self-determination, but instead stated: "Before the conditions for establishing complete democracy in the colonies are mature, Britain has an obligation to maintain supervision over the colonies."

After Mr. Delepe's speech, representatives from delegations who had raised various different proposals on the colonial issue spoke. Subsequently, the chairman announced the end of the discussion. Representative Brockway protested against this, because the presidium of the annual conference did not actually allow everyone to discuss the substance of the programmatic document proposed by the Executive Committee.

The representatives who spoke on the various proposals submitted to the annual conference unanimously condemned the policy of racial discrimination adopted in British colonies.

The resolution submitted to the annual conference by the Electrical Trades Union demanded "the withdrawal of all troops from the colonies and the granting of the democratic right for the people of the colonies to elect their own government." The resolution also expressed support for the struggle of the colonial people for complete national independence.

The Executive Committee opposed the proposal demanding the withdrawal of troops from British colonies. The result of the vote was that this proposal was rejected.

The annual conference passed the Labour Party's program on colonial issues, and also passed a resolution condemning the implementation of racial discrimination in the Union of South Africa.

According to a proposal from the Mixed Mechanical Industries Union, a resolution was passed condemning "the government's current policy in Cyprus," and demanding that the Labour Party Parliamentary Group "firmly advocate a solution to this problem based on the principle of recognizing the right to self-determination of the people of Cyprus."

The conference also passed a resolution requesting the immediate establishment of a committee to investigate the situation of "severe punishment" imposed on non-European men, women and children in Kenya.

At the meeting on the 4th, the Executive Committee also opposed a proposal requiring the Labour Party to abolish British conscription after taking power. This proposal was rejected by the meeting.

    英工党年会在领导集团控制下
    通过空洞的殖民地问题纲领
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社讯：在英国工党年会10月4日会议上，党的执行委员会委员德里柏把执行委员会草拟的最后一个纲领文件提交会议讨论。
    纲领的草拟人把英国资本对殖民地的经济奴役问题摊在一边，而把“在殖民地建立民主社会”作为工党的主要目标。纲领对于像民族自决权这样的重大问题只字不提，反而说：“在殖民地建立完全民主的条件还没有成熟以前，英国有义务维持对殖民地的监督”。
    在德里柏发言之后，由那些对殖民地问题提出各种不同的提案的代表团的代表们发言。随后，主席宣布讨论结束。代表布罗克威对这一点表示抗议，因为年会主席团实际上没有让大家对执行委员会所提出的纲领文件的实质展开讨论。
    就提交年会讨论的各项提案发言的代表一致谴责在英国殖民地所采取的种族歧视政策。
    电气工会提交年会讨论的决议要求“从殖民地撤退所有的军队，给予殖民地人民选举自己政府的民主权利”。决议还表示支持殖民地人民争取完全的民族独立的斗争。
    执行委员会反对要求军队撤出英国殖民地的提案。投票结果，这个提案被否决了。
    年会通过了工党关于殖民地问题的纲领，并且通过谴责在南非联邦实行种族歧视的决议。
    根据混合机械工业工会的建议通过一项决议，这项决议谴责“政府目前在塞浦路斯所采取的政策”，并且要求工党议会党团“坚决主张根据承认塞浦路斯人民有自决权的原则来解决这个问题”。
    会议还通过决议，要求立即设立一个委员会来调查在怯尼亚对非欧洲籍男女和儿童所实行的“严厉处罚”的情况。
    在4日会议上执行委员会还反对要求工党在执政之后废除英国的兵役制的提案。这个提案被会议否决了。
