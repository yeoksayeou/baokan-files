“Ah Q True Story,” Lu Xun's most important work and the most outstanding novel since the May Fourth Movement, created the immortal character of Ah Q. A fictional character, living not only in books but also circulating in life, becoming a common noun people use to refer to certain individuals, a model people are willing to emulate or unwilling to emulate – this is the highest mark of success a character in a work can achieve. In the new literature since the May Fourth Movement, including novels and dramas, only the character of Ah Q has achieved such success, thus being ranked alongside famous literary figures in China and the world.

"The True Story of Ah Q" was published in the "Morning News Supplement" in Beijing from 1921 to 1922. In 1923, Shen Yanbing, who later also became a famous novelist, wrote: "Now, there is hardly a young person who loves literature who hasn't said the words 'Ah Q.' We almost use these two words everywhere..." ("Reading 'Call to Arms'"). This is how Ah Q quickly and widely spread. Now, it has long since gone beyond young people who love literature and circulates among the broader masses of the people.

However, even now, our literary criticism still has differing interpretations of this character, and none of the interpretations are entirely satisfactory.

The difficulty and contradiction lie mainly here: Ah Q is a peasant, but the Ah Q spirit is a negative and shameful phenomenon.

To resolve this contradiction, some have denied that Ah Q is a peasant, or deduced from Ah Q's statement "We were much richer than you before" that he was descended from a declining landlord and different from ordinary peasants. This method of attempting to interpret literary figures purely from a class component is obviously naive. According to the description in the novel itself, no one can deny Ah Q's status as a hired farmhand. "We were much richer than you before" is merely a manifestation of Ah Q's psychological victory method, and also a satire by the author of some unprogressive people at the time who liked to boast about China's past glory. This "before" does not necessarily refer to himself, but probably to his ancestors. We cannot use this sentence to determine Ah Q's class origin, just as we cannot, based on another expression of his psychological victory method, "My son will be much richer," conclude that he will definitely become a wealthy old man in the future. Moreover, some very important aspects of Ah Q's character, including his initial "really capable" and his later request to participate in the revolution, cannot be explained by the characteristics of a declining landlord class's offspring.

Another interpretation is that Ah Q is a synthesis of various shortcomings in the Chinese spirit, or that he is a spiritual characterization and typification, saying that he is mainly a thought-based figure, a carrier of Ah Q-ism or the Ah Q spirit, a collection in which all classes and all kinds of Ah Q-isms are gathered. This interpretation is also inappropriate. None of the literary figures in the world are not highly generalized and ideologically significant, and at the same time are, or can even be said to be primarily, a concrete, living person. These two are inseparable. If Ah Q is merely a synthesis of various shortcomings or a spiritual characterization and typification, then he could not become a realistic literary figure, but merely a conceptualized, unreal character. In "The True Story of Ah Q," Ah Q's character is consistent from beginning to end, and his thoughts and words, except in very individual places, are very harmonious with his class status, social position, and unique character. He is not a monster pieced together from various shortcomings in the Chinese spirit or all kinds of Ah Q-isms from all classes, but a flesh-and-blood individual that we have met before. The comrades who put forward the collective theory also admit that Ah Q is a living character, but this admission contradicts their theory of spiritual characterization and typification. Therefore, the proposer of this interpretation later changed his opinion.

More commentators interpret Ah Q as a typical example of the backward peasants of the past, believing that the Ah Q spirit in him is not something originally possessed by peasants, but is influenced by the ideology of the feudal landlord class. These commentators all use the famous saying "The ideas of the ruling class are the ruling ideas" as their basis. There is no problem that, in terms of Ah Q's entire character, he is a typical example of the backward peasants of the past. Similarly, there is no problem that those "conforming to the classics and sages" ideas in Ah Q's mind, "If there are no descendants, no one will offer a bowl of rice," emphasizing "the great prevention between men and women" and rejecting heresy, are all feudal ideas. Moreover, Ah Q's entire ignorance is also a result of the long-term feudal exploitation and feudal oppression. But the most prominent feature of his character, which we call the Ah Q spirit, is not necessarily a unique product of the feudal landlord class and the ruling ideology. The ruling ideas of the ruling class in every era mentioned by Marx and Engels, as they themselves explained, "are the ideological expression of the dominant material relationships," "are the ideological expression of the relationships which make one class the ruling one.” Obviously, the Ah Q spirit is not such a thing; it does not express the unique nature of feudal ideology. Moreover, if it is said that Lu Xun only used the character of Ah Q to lash out at the feudal ideas in the backward peasants before and after the Xinhai Revolution, then the ideological significance of this character is narrowed too much. So this interpretation is still not satisfactory.

What is the most prominent feature of Ah Q's character? As everyone knows, it is his psychological victory method. Like real-life characters, literary figures always have complex and multifaceted characters. Ah Q is "really capable," very self-respecting, yet very able to belittle himself, conservative, rejects heresy, does not resist the strong after being humiliated but vents on the weak, is somewhat numb and cunning, originally deeply abhorred rebellion but later yearned for revolution – these are all parts of his character. But what the novel particularly emphasizes is his psychological victory method. The two chapters of "Brief Account of Superiority" focus on writing about this characteristic of his. Boasting about the "previous" wealth and imagining his son's wealth to despise others, being taboo about his own scabies and scolding others for "not being worthy," thinking in his heart "the world is too unruly now, the son beats the father" after being beaten, advocating "gentlemen use words, not fists" when he can't win, even beating his own mouth when other psychological victory methods fail to "turn defeat into victory"... all of these are concrete manifestations of the Ah Q spirit. It is this Ah Q that is popular in our lives. Whenever we see such a person, who cannot face his weaknesses and uses ridiculous words to cover them up, we call him "Ah Q," and then he is ashamed. Whenever we feel our own weaknesses and do not have the courage to admit them, to overcome them, and sometimes even have the idea of covering them up, we think of Ah Q, and then we are ashamed. This is how literary figures are: what circulates in life and plays a role is often not their entire character, but the most prominent feature of their character.

Lu Xun said in "The Genesis of The True Story of Ah Q," "The image of Ah Q seems to have been in my mind for several years." Xu Shoushang said in "Impressions of My Deceased Friend Lu Xun" that Lu Xun paid close attention to studying the "national character" of China when he was studying in Japan. Subjectively, the author intended to use Ah Q to criticize the weaknesses of the "national character" in his mind. In his essays, he had repeatedly criticized this weakness. In "On the Power of Mara Poetry," written in 1907, there is the following passage:

	Therefore, the so-called ancient civilized countries are sad words, sarcastic terms! Descendants of the fallen, the family is desolate, then they chatter to people, saying what their ancestors were like in terms of wisdom and martial prowess, once having grand houses and tall buildings, pearls and jades, dogs and horses, being more honorable than ordinary people. Who would not laugh upon hearing their words?
	National development, although meritorious in cherishing the past, cherishes it with clear thinking, like a mirror, constantly reflecting on the past, constantly advancing on the long road of light, constantly remembering the brilliant past, so that the new is renewed daily, and the old is not dead. If one does not know the reason why, and boasts for self-gratification, then the beginning of the long night is at that time. Now, try to walk the streets of China, and you will see soldiers swaggering through the city, opening their mouths to sing military songs, denouncing the slavishness of India and Poland; the same is true of those who casually sing national anthems. For China today is also thinking of listing the former glories, but failing to speak of them, they say that the left neighbor is already enslaved, and the right neighbor is about to die, choosing the dying countries to compare with, hoping to show their own superiority. Whether the two countries are inferior to China, I will not say for now; if it is said that songs of praise are the voice of the nation, then there are many singers in the world, but I have never seen this kind of creation.

Isn't the weakness he criticized here the same as Ah Q boasting about how rich he used to be and despising Wang Hu, who was also scabby and bearded, despite having scabies himself? In 1918, he criticized the so-called "gregarious, patriotic arrogance" in "Random Thoughts" thirty-eight and divided this arrogance into five types:

	A says: "China has vast land and abundant resources, and was the first to be civilized; morality is the best in the world." This is complete conceit.
	B says: "Although foreign material civilization is high, Chinese spiritual civilization is better."
	C says: "Foreign things, China has already had; a certain science, that is what a certain scholar said, etc." These two are branches of the "ancient and modern Chinese and foreign school"; based on Zhang Zhidong's maxim, "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for application."
	D says: "Foreign countries also have beggars - (or say) also have thatched houses, - prostitutes, - bedbugs." This is passive resistance.
	E says: "China is better off being barbaric," and also says: "You say Chinese thought is chaotic, that is precisely the crystallization of our national undertaking. Starting from the chaos of our ancestors, we will be chaotic to our descendants; starting from the chaos of the past, we will be chaotic to the future. ... (We are 400 million people,) can you exterminate us?" This is a step further than "D," not dragging others down, but taking pride in one's own ugliness; as for the toughness of the tone, it is very much like Niu Er in Water Margin.

Although these five arguments differ in degree, aren't they all concrete manifestations of the Ah Q spirit? As for what he wrote in "On Opening Your Eyes to See" in 1925, it is even more like a general explanation of the Ah Q spirit:

	The Chinese dare not face all aspects, using concealment and deception to create wonderful escape routes, and thinking of them as the right path. On this path, the weakness, laziness, and cunning of the national character are proven. Satisfying themselves day by day, they are falling day by day, but they feel that they are becoming more and more glorious.

Obviously, Lu Xun did not think that the Ah Q spirit was only a weakness existing in the backward peasants of that time, nor did he regard it as merely a feudal ideology. He called it "national character," which is naturally inappropriate; but it is a fact that the Ah Q spirit can be seen in people of different classes, and this does indeed have a basis in life. In 1841, after the defeat of the Guangdong War in the First Opium War, the Qing Dynasty general Yishan begged for surrender from the British army but falsely reported to the Qing Dynasty emperor that he had won the battle, saying "burning and attacking, greatly thwarting their edge," saying that the British "were impoverished and begged for appeasement" ("Chronicles of China and the West," volume six). The Qing Dynasty emperor actually said: "These barbarians are like dogs and sheep and are not worth arguing with. Moreover, they have already been punished and shown military might. Now, the residents inside the city have submitted many reports, and it is also reported that these barbarians took off their hats and saluted, pleading for us to forward their request for grace. I understand the difficult situation of you all and allow trade." ("Complete Records of the Management of Barbarian Affairs," volume twenty-nine). "Encouraging Learning," published in 1898, its author Zhang Zhidong said in the initial "Preface": "Chinese scholarship is profound, the ethical codes, the relationship between sovereign and subject, as well as the great methods of managing the world, are all fully equipped; only take the length of the Western manufacturing to fill my inadequacy; ... their etiquette and customs are inevitably barbaric, but the subtleties of scholarship and principle cannot be dreamed of by them." This is the psychological victory method of the Qing Dynasty emperors and ministers. The rulers of the Qing Dynasty after the Opium War carried this Ah Q spirit until the demise of their dynasty. Gu Hongming praised queues and bound feet, autocracy and polygamy, and said that the Chinese are dirty, but that is good dirty. Lin Sun's poem, published in the fourth issue of the fourth volume of "New Youth," begins with the lines: "Enjoy their happiness, compare bitterness with them! Admire their beauty, compare ugliness with them!" This is the psychological victory method of the old intellectuals of the past. It is said that Lu Xun often quoted these lines of Lin Sun to illustrate the strange thoughts of the scholar-officials (Zhou Xiasou, "Characters in Lu Xun's Novels"). As for the scabies, which was taken as a symbol of Ah Q's weakness, in the old Chinese countryside, it was indeed a taboo from landlords to peasants, and it was extended to even tabooing "light," "bright," "lamp," and "candle." "The son beats the father" was also similarly widely circulated in the mouths of various different people in old China. Lu Xun also wrote an article called "On 'His Mother!'" He explained this type of very popular curse word as an attack by the common people on "high-ranking families," which is probably too convoluted. This, like "the son beats the father," is an Ah Q-style psychological victory method. The Ah Q spirit is indeed not a unique phenomenon of one class.

Lu Xun also said in "Reply to the Editors of 'Play' Weekly": "My method is to make the reader not be able to touch anyone other than themselves in writing, pushing it away all at once, turning into an observer, and suspecting that it is like writing about oneself, and like writing about everyone, thereby opening up a path of reflection." This is not only explaining his general writing method, but also explaining "The True Story of Ah Q." When "The True Story of Ah Q" was published, some petty politicians and petty bureaucrats were indeed suspicious and thought it was satirizing them. Moreover, after its publication, this common noun was first popular among intellectual youth. It can be seen that the author's subjective intention and the objective effect of the work are not only to lash out at the backward peasants of old China, nor only to lash out at the feudal ideas in them.

However, the characters in literary works, like people in real life, must also be social figures. Although Lu Xun subjectively wanted to expose what he considered to be the weaknesses of "national character," he could not find an abstract representative of "national character" on Chinese soil. He chose Ah Q, a hired farmhand before and after the Xinhai Revolution, as the protagonist, so he could not stop at just writing about his scabies, just writing about his psychological victory method, just writing about his superiority which is actually inferiority and defeat; he could not but unfold the description of the class relations in the old Chinese countryside, he could not but write about some characters like Zhao Taiye, Zhao Xiucai, and Qian the fake foreigner, in addition to Ah Q; he could not but write about Ah Q's exploitation and oppression, writing about his transformation from opposing rebellion to yearning for revolution; he could not but write about the incompleteness of the Xinhai Revolution, writing about Ah Q's request to participate in the revolution but being rejected, and finally getting such a tragic "happy ending." This is precisely the great victory of realism. In this way, Lu Xun's most important work, the most outstanding novel since the May Fourth Movement, "The True Story of Ah Q," its achievement is not only creating the immortal figure of Ah Q, but also profoundly writing about the truth of the old Chinese countryside and the weaknesses of the old democratic revolution led by the bourgeoisie. In this way, Ah Q is not a synthesis of various shortcomings in the Chinese spirit, not a spiritual characterization and typification, not a collection, but a concrete, living character, a unique existence, a figure with a very distinct personality. In terms of the Ah Q spirit, what exists in Ah Q is the Ah Q spirit with a strong peasant flavor, not all kinds of Ah Q-isms from all classes, although there are commonalities between them. From the perspective of peasants, Ah Q is only a peasant with a strong Ah Q spirit, only a type of peasant, not the entire peasantry, although he has the commonalities of peasants. There has been such a comment that Ah Q finally wanted to become a revolutionary party member, and finally got a "happy ending," as if he were two people in personality. This comment is due to only seeing the Ah Q spirit in Ah Q and not seeing that he is a hired farmhand. When Lu Xun wrote about him yearning for revolution and deciding to surrender to the revolution, he was still the Ah Q we were already very familiar with, still carrying the backward color of the Ah Q style. Even when he reached the final scene, he "learned without a teacher" and said half a sentence, "In twenty years, another ...," although this last expression of his psychological victory method was so sorrowful and so heavy, we could no longer laugh. So throughout the novel, Ah Q's character has developed, but it is still very unified. Only when we read that he was carried onto a cart without a canopy, and suddenly realized that he was going to be beheaded, the novel said that although he was anxious, he was also somewhat calm, "In his mind, it seemed that life in the world, there would always be times when one would be beheaded." Then we read that when he was paraded through the streets, the novel said that he did not know, "But even if he knew, it would be the same, he only thought that life in the world, there would always be times when one would be paraded through the streets." That is like putting the cynical thoughts of the scholar-officials on his head, and we feel a little uneasy.

Lu Xun himself said that he wrote "The True Story of Ah Q," "actually not for the purpose of humor or pity" ("Lu Xun's Letters," page 249). Ah Q being exploited and oppressed, especially his request to participate in the Xinhai Revolution but being rejected and slaughtered, all aroused our sympathy. Moreover, we also saw the resistance and revolutionary spirit of the peasants from this backward peasant Ah Q. However, if, as some commentators have said, the Ah Q spirit is regarded as a spirit of resistance, or Ah Q is regarded as a general weak character, and it is thought that Lu Xun mainly sympathized with or even loved him, then it is not only far from the author's original intention, but also does not conform to the objective effect of the work. When we read "The True Story of Ah Q," we experience such a change in emotion, initially mainly despising Ah Q but finally sympathizing with him taking the upper hand. This is really somewhat like what Tolstoy said about Chekhov's "Darling," the author originally intended to curse him, but ended up blessing him instead. But the main effect of the work is still consistent with the author's purpose. The Ah Q that is popular in our lives is the Ah Q whose main characteristic is the psychological victory method, a negative example that no one is willing to emulate. With the appearance of Ah Q in literature, many, many people in life are no longer willing to be Ah Q.

Ah Q is a peasant, but the Ah Q spirit is a negative and shameful phenomenon, and it is not a phenomenon unique to one class. How should this be explained in theory? Theory should explain the complex phenomena that exist in life, thereby enriching itself, and should not simplify the complex phenomena in life, thereby forcibly fitting some existing concepts and views. The question of the interpretation of Ah Q's character is actually a question of the relationship between typicality and class nature. The difficulty arises from this: many commentators seem to have such an idea in mind that typicality is equal to class nature. However, in actual life, in literary phenomena, the character of a person and his class nature cannot be equated mathematically. The reason is easy to understand. If typicality is completely equal to class nature, then only one typical character can be written from each class, and no typical character can be written after the class is eliminated. In this way, the scope for literary art to create characters is extremely narrow. In class society, real people all have class status and therefore all have class nature. The characters in literary works that depict class society cannot but have class nature, and the characters of certain typical figures do indeed express the essential characteristics of certain classes. However, there are people of different characters in the same class, which determines that literature can also write a variety of typical examples from one class. Probably no one would deny this. There is also a phenomenon in life that certain characteristics can be seen in people of different classes. If a literary work describes such a person and prominently describes this characteristic, although he also has his class status and class nature, this characteristic of his character does not seem to be a class phenomenon. Zhuge Liang, Don Quixote, and Ah Q are all such typical examples. Zhuge Liang's status is an intellectual and politician of the feudal ruling class, but the most prominent characteristic of Zhuge Liang's character in the novel is that he is very intelligent and can foresee things. Hoping to have wisdom and foresight is not only a requirement of the politicians of the feudal ruling class, but also a requirement of the people. Therefore, Zhuge Liang is circulated in the mouths of the people and has become a popular figure among the people, and the proverb "Three cobblers can make a Zhuge Liang" which sings the collective's wisdom has been produced. Don Quixote's identity is an old-fashioned landlord in the Spanish countryside. He not only has his class nature, but also has the colors of a specific era and a specific region. The plot of the novel mainly writes that after the European medieval chivalry system has died out, this old-fashioned landlord still wants to be a knight-errant, and as a result, he constantly encounters ridiculous failures. Don Quixote's entire character is more than this, but what is most prominently described in the novel is such a characteristic. Therefore, this name is popular in our lives and has become a common noun for ridiculous subjectivists. Subjectivism is certainly not a class phenomenon, so the meaning of this figure, Don Quixote, is not lost due to differences in time and region. Ah Q is also like this. His status is a hired farmhand before and after the Xinhai Revolution, and his character and actions strongly bear the characteristics of his class and era. When explaining Ah Q's character, many commentators have pointed out his specific historical background, pointing out that the Ah Q spirit was an unusually common existence in the declining and humiliated Great Qing Empire after the Opium War. This is correct. It was precisely because Ah Q-style thoughts and statements were very popular in the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China that Lu Xun conceived of such a figure as Ah Q. However, the most prominent characteristic of Ah Q described in the novel - not being able to face one's own weaknesses and attempting to cover them up with some ridiculous, self-deceiving thoughts and statements - can be seen in people of many different classes and different eras. How should this be explained? We know that all exploiting classes (not just the feudal landlord class) cannot openly admit their weaknesses and poor conditions in order to maintain and consolidate their rule, especially when they encounter difficulties and failures, but will inevitably take self-deceiving measures to cover them up. The particularly strong Ah Q spirit of the ruling class and its intellectuals in semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China, and its particularly deformed and ugly manifestation, to the point that it was mistakenly regarded as "national character" by Lu Xun, is the reason for this. Laboring people like Ah Q, who have nothing but labor power, originally did not need to be taboo about their weaknesses. However, when he is not yet aware, he cannot but have conservatism and backwardness, and this conservatism and backwardness cannot but prevent him from facing, acknowledging, and overcoming his weaknesses, and from covering them up in ridiculous ways. That is to say, the Ah Q spirit can also be produced in the backward part of the people. Some commentators believe that the era of Ah Q has passed, and the Ah Q spirit has completely passed, forever passed. This does not conform to objective facts and thereby reduces the significance of the figure of Ah Q. In our lives today, whenever we encounter someone who refuses criticism and self-criticism and uses some ridiculous thoughts and statements to cover up his shortcomings and mistakes, no matter how different his thoughts and statements are from that old Ah Q, we still cannot help but call him "Ah Q." From the imperialist elements who are increasingly isolated and defeated and their puppet regimes that are raised and are enemies of the people, we often hear Ah Q-style cries and moans. Shen Yanbing, an early commentator on "The True Story of Ah Q," said: "I also feel that the 'Ah Q phase' is not entirely unique to the Chinese nation, but seems to be a common weakness of humanity." ("Reading 'Call to Arms'"). This feeling is based on evidence. Of course, in class society, the "common weaknesses of humanity" cannot but bear the color of class, the characteristics of class. Subjectivism and the Ah Q spirit among the exploiting classes and the laboring people have similarities and differences. And the most important difference lies here: the subjectivism and Ah Q spirit of the exploiting classes in the period of decline cannot be removed and will always follow them like their shadows until their demise; while the subjectivism and Ah Q spirit of the laboring people can be avoided and overcome, because we are not afraid to admit our mistakes and shortcomings, and we hold high the weapon of Marxism-Leninism, the weapon of self-criticism.

It is necessary to conduct a class analysis of literary phenomena in class society. But it would be a big mistake to think that complex literary problems can be solved simply by relying on or casually applying concepts such as class and class nature. Not only in the interpretation of Ah Q, but also in the debate over Granny Liu in "Dream of the Red Chamber" and the demons in "Journey to the West," there has been a tendency toward simplification. Granny Liu is a woman from a peasant family, but when she appears in the Grand View Garden, she has the air of a female hanger-on. Based on this characteristic of her character, some people once called Wu Zhihui, that kind of reactionary, ruling-class helper, "Granny Liu." When Granny Liu appeared in the Grand View Garden, the novel also focused on describing her unfamiliarity with and lack of knowledge of upper-class social life. Based on this other characteristic of her character, a proverb, "Granny Liu entering the Grand View Garden," is also popular in our lives. Not knowing that only a certain characteristic of the characters in literary figures often plays a role in our lives, not his entire character, and the entire character is not entirely equal to his class nature, but trying to get explanations from his class status, the debate is entangled in classifying the characters, and a correct conclusion can never be reached. The demons in "Journey to the West," many of them are transformed from animals, so these images of demons transformed from animals first have some characteristics that fit their original form. Since they are demons, they naturally have some characteristics of demons, such as being able to transform and use magic. They can all transform into humans, so they have human characteristics. When the author describes the last of these characteristics on them, he naturally uses real people as models. Therefore, it is possible to find something similar to the class nature of humans in some demons, but it will not be the class nature of a unified class. Because the author is ultimately writing about all kinds of demons, not writing about the various people in a unified class. Moreover, if we read "Journey to the West" with a realistic attitude, we will also find and admit this fact: in many demons, the author only describes the characteristics of animals, the characteristics of demons, and certain external or general characteristics of humans, and fundamentally cannot find class nature. In short, for such a large number of demons who come from different places and have different characters, just like those fox spirits described in "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," it is necessary to conduct concrete research and careful distinctions. But many of our commentators insist on classifying these demons, and they insist on classifying them into a unified class. First, they are all classified as peasants, and all are peasant uprisings, so Sun Wukong, who has always been loved by the people, must become a lackey of the feudal ruling class who suppresses peasant uprisings. Later, some commentators felt uneasy and went the other way, so they uniformly defined those demons as reactionary ruling classes, either relatives of the emperor or local bullies. It seems that the author of "Journey to the West," Wu Cheng'en, was not writing his fantasy novel, but was doing land reform work in a world full of gods and demons, and had already decided on their class components in his mind, only waiting for us to publish the list. Applying the concepts of class and class nature in such a mechanical and simple way can only be said to be a mockery of Marxism.

Studying the characters in literary works, just like studying problems in life, cannot start from concepts. It is necessary to consider all of its complexity, it is necessary to strive to explain it according to its original appearance and meaning, it is necessary to pay attention to the role and effect it plays in actual life, and it is necessary to think about it in connection with the various typical figures in literary history. It is naturally much more difficult to do this. Precisely because it is difficult, the explanation of Ah Q that I have tried to make here is probably still far from a more satisfactory explanation. But I believe that by using this method, it is possible to reach a more satisfactory explanation from an unsatisfactory one.

专栏：

    论阿Q
    何其芳
    鲁迅的最重要的作品，“五四”以来最杰出的小说“阿Q正传”，创造了阿Q这个不朽的典型。一个虚构的人物，不仅活在书本上，而且流行在生活中，成为人们用来称呼某些人的共名，成为人们愿意仿效或者不愿意仿效的榜样，这是作品中的人物所能达到的最高的成功的标志。在“五四”以来的新文学里面，包括小说和戏剧，只有阿Q这个人物获得了这样的成功，从而与我国和世界的文学上的著名的典型并列在一起。
    “阿Q正传”发表于1921年至1922年的北京“晨报副镌”。1923年，后来也成为著名的小说家的沈雁冰就写道：“现在差不多没有一个爱好文艺的青年口里不曾说过‘阿Q’这两个字。我们几乎到处应用这两个字……”（“读‘呐喊’”）。阿Q就是这样迅速而广泛地流传的。现在，早已不止于爱好文艺的青年，而是流传在更广大的人民中间了。
    然而，直到现在，我们的文学批评对这个人物的解释仍然是分歧的，而且各种解释都并不圆满。
    困难和矛盾主要在这里：阿Q是一个农民，但阿Q精神却是一种消极的可耻的现象。
    为了解决这个矛盾，曾有人否认阿Q是农民，或者从阿Q说过的“我们先前——比你阔的多啦”这句话，断定他是从地主破落下来的，和一般农民不同。这种企图单纯从阶级成分来解释文学典型的方法显然是幼稚的。按照小说本身的描写，阿Q的雇农身分谁也无法否认。“我们先前——比你阔的多啦”，这不过是阿Q的精神胜利法的一种表现，同时也是作者对于当时有些不长进的人喜欢夸耀我国过去的光荣的一种嘲讽。这“先前”不一定是指他本人，很可能是他的先世。我们并不能用这句话来断定阿Q的阶级出身，正如并不能根据他的精神胜利法的又一表现“我的儿子会阔得多啦”，就断定他将来一定会成为阔人的老太爷一样。而且阿Q的性格的某些很重要的方面，包括开头的“真能做”和后来的要求参加革命，都并不能用破落的地主阶级的子弟的特性来解释。
    还有一种解释说阿Q是中国人精神方面的各种毛病的综合，或者说他是一种精神的性格化和典型化，说他主要是一个思想性的典型，是阿Q主义或阿Q精神的寄植者，是一个在身上集合着各阶级的各色各样的阿Q主义的集合体。这种解释也不妥当。世界上的文学的典型，没有一个不是具有高度的概括性和思想的意义，而又同时是，或者还可以说首先是一个具体的活生生的人。这两者是不可分离的。如果阿Q只是各种毛病的综合或者某种精神的性格化和典型化，那他就不可能成为现实主义的文学的典型，而不过是一个概念化的不真实的人物。在“阿Q正传”里面，阿Q的性格从头至尾都是统一的，他的思想和言行除了极其个别的地方，都是和他的阶级身分，社会地位和特有的性格很和谐的。他并不是一个用中国人精神方面的各种毛病或者各阶级的各色各样的阿Q主义拼凑起来的怪物，而是一个我们似曾相识的有血有肉的个人。提出集合体的说法的同志也承认阿Q是一个活生生的人物，但这种承认就和他的一种精神的性格化和典型化的说法自相矛盾了。因此，这种解释的提出者后来也改变了他的意见。
    更多的评论者是把阿Q解释为过去的落后的农民的典型，认为他身上的阿Q精神并不是农民本来有的东西，而是受了封建地主阶级的思想的影响。这些评论者都以“统治阶级的思想就是统治的思想”这样的名言来作为根据。没有问题，就阿Q的整个性格来说，他是过去的落后的农民的一种典型。同样没有问题，阿Q头脑里的那些“合于圣经贤传”的想法，“断子绝孙便没有人供一碗饭”，强调“男女之大防”和排斥异端，都是封建思想。而且整个阿Q的愚昧也是长期存在的封建剥削封建压迫的一种结果。但我们称为阿Q精神的他性格上的那种最突出的特点，却未见得是封建地主阶级的特有的产物和统治的思想。马克思和恩格斯所说的每个时代里的统治阶级的统治思想，如他们自己所说明的，“是统治的物质关系底观念的表现”，“是那些使这一阶级成为统治阶级的关系底观念的表现”。很显然，阿Q精神并不是这样的东西，它并没有表现封建思想的特有的性质。而且，如果说鲁迅通过阿Q这个人物只是鞭打了辛亥革命前后的落后的农民身上的封建思想，那就未免把这个典型的思想意义缩小得太狭窄了。所以这种解释仍然是不圆满的。
    阿Q性格上的最突出的特点是什么呢？如大家所熟知的，是他的精神胜利法。文学上的典型和生活中的人物一样，他的性格总是复杂的，多方面的。阿Q“真能做”，很自尊，又很能够自轻自贱，保守，排斥异端，受到屈辱后不向强者反抗而在弱者身上发泄，有些麻木和狡猾，本来深恶造反而后来又神往革命，这些都是他的性格。但小说中加以特别突出的描写的却是他的精神胜利法。两章“优胜纪略”就是集中写他的这种特点。夸耀“先前”的阔和设想儿子的阔来藐视别人，忌讳自己的癞疮疤而又骂别人“还不配”，被人打了一顿却在心里想“现在的世界太不成话，儿子打老子”，打不赢别人的时候便主张“君子动口不动手”，甚至在其他精神胜利法都应用不灵的时候便痛打自己的嘴巴，这样来“转败为胜”……，所有这些都是写的阿Q精神的具体表现。流行在我们生活中的正是这个阿Q。凡是见到这样的人，他不能正视他的弱点，而且用可耻笑的说法来加以掩饰，我们就叫他“阿Q”，于是他就羞惭了。凡是我们感到了自己的弱点，而又没有勇气去承认，去克服，有时还浮起了掩饰它的念头，我们就想到了阿Q，于是我们就羞惭了。文学上的典型都是这样的，他们流行在生活中并且起着作用的常常并不是他的全部性格，而是他们的性格上的最突出的特点。
    鲁迅在“阿Q正传的成因”中说，“阿Q的影像，在我心目中似乎确已有了好几年”。许寿裳在“亡友鲁迅印象记”中说，鲁迅在日本留学的时候就很注意研究中国的“国民性”。在主观上作者是有通过阿Q来抨击他心目中的“国民性”的弱点的意思的。在他的论文中，他曾经多次地批评过这种弱点。1907年写的“摩罗诗力说”就有这样一段话：
        故所谓古文明国者，悲凉之语耳，嘲讽之辞耳！中落之胄，
    故家荒矣，则喋喋语人，谓厥祖在时，其为智慧武怒者何似，尝
    有闳宇崇楼，珠玉犬马，尊显胜于凡人。有闻其言，孰不腾笑？
    夫国民发展，功虽有在于怀古，然其怀也，思理朗然，如鉴明镜
    ，时时上征，时时反顾，时时进光明之长涂，时时念辉煌之旧有
    ，故其新者日新，而其古亦不死。若不知所以然，漫夸耀以自悦
    ，则长夜之始，即在斯时。今试履中国之大衢，当有见军人蹀躞
    而过市者，张口作军歌，痛斥印度波兰之奴性；有漫为国歌者亦
    然。盖中国今日，亦颇思历举前有之耿光，特未能言，则姑曰左
    邻已奴，右邻且死，择亡国而较量之，冀自显其佳胜。夫二国与
    震旦孰劣，今姑弗言；若云颂美之什，国民之声，则天下之咏者
    虽多，固未见有此作法矣。他在这里所批评的弱点，不是和阿Q
    夸耀先前如何阔，并且自己头上有癞疮疤，却藐视又癞又胡的王胡一样吗？1918年，他在“随感录”三十八中批评了所谓“合群的爱国的自大”，并且把这种自大分为五种：
    甲云：“中国地大物博，开化最早；道德天下第一。”这是完全自负。
    乙云：“外国物质文明虽高，中国精神文明更好。”
    丙云：“外国的东西，中国都已有过；某种科学，即某子所说的云云，”这两种都是“古今中外派”的支流；依据张之洞的格言，以“中学为体西学为用”的人物。
    丁云：“外国也有叫化子——（或云）也有草舍，——娼妓，——臭虫。”这是消极的反抗。
    戊云：“中国便是野蛮的好，”又云：“你说中国思想昏乱，那正是我民族所造成的事业的
    结晶。从祖先昏乱起，直要昏乱到子孙；从过去昏乱起，直要昏乱到未来。……（我们是四万万人，）你能把我们灭绝么？”这比“丁”更进一层，不去拖人下水，反以自己的丑恶骄人；至于口气的强硬，却很有水浒传中牛二的态度。这五种议论虽然程度不同，不都是阿Q精神的具体表现吗？至于1925年，他在“论睁了眼看”中所写的这些话，就更像是对于阿Q精神的总说明了：
        中国人的不敢正视各方面，用瞒和骗，造出奇妙的逃路来，
    而自以为正路。在这路上，就证明着国民性的怯弱，懒惰，而又
    巧滑。一天一天的满足着，即一天一天的堕落着，但却又觉得日
    见其光荣。很显然，鲁迅并不认为阿Q精神只是存在在当时的落后的农民身上的弱点，也并不把它看作仅仅是一种封建思想。他把它称为“国民性”，这自然是不妥当的；但如果说阿Q精神在不同的阶级的人物身上都可以见到，这却是事实，这却的确有生活上的根据。1841年，第一次鸦片战争中的广东战争失败后，清朝的将军奕山向英军卑屈求降、对清朝的皇帝却诳报打了胜仗，说“焚击痛剿，大挫其锋”，说英人“穷蹙乞抚”（“中西纪事”卷六）。清朝的皇帝居然也就这样说：“该夷性等犬羊，不值与之计较。况既经惩创，已示兵威。现经城内居民纷纷递禀又据奏称该夷免冠作礼，吁求转奏乞恩。朕谅汝等不得已之苦衷，准令通商。”（“筹办夷务始末”卷二十九）1898年出版的“劝学篇”，它的作者张之洞在最初的“自序”上说：“中国学术精微，纲常名教以及经世大法，无不毕具；但取西人制造之长补我不逮足矣；……其礼教政俗已不免于夷狄之陋，学术义理之微则非彼所能梦见者矣。”这就是清朝的皇帝和大臣们的精神胜利法。鸦片战争以后的清朝的统治者们就是带着这样的阿Q精神一直到他们的王朝的灭亡的。辜鸿铭极力称赞辫子和小脚，专制和多妻制，并且说中国人脏，那就是脏得好。“新青年”第四卷第四号上发表过林损的一首诗，开头两行是：“乐他们不过，同他们比苦！美他们不过，同他们比丑！”这就是过去的旧知识分子的精神胜利法。据说鲁迅常常引林损这几句诗来说明士大夫的怪思想（周遐寿“鲁迅小说里的人物”）。至于被取来作为阿Q的弱点的象征的癞疮疤，在旧中国的农村里，那的确是从地主到农民，都一律忌讳，而且推广到连“光”“亮”“灯”“烛”也忌讳的。“儿子打老子”，也是同样广泛地流行在旧中国的各种不同的人们的口中。鲁迅还做过一篇文章，叫做“论‘他妈的！’”。对这一类非常流行的骂语，他解释为是庶民对于“高门大族”的攻击，那恐怕是过于曲折的。这和“儿子打老子”一样，都是阿Q式的精神胜利法。阿Q精神的确并非一个阶级的特有的现象。
    鲁迅在“答‘戏’周刊编者信”中又说：“我的方法是在使读者摸不着在写自己以外的谁，一下子就推诿掉，变成旁观者，而疑心到像是写自己，又像是写一切人，由此开出反省的道路。”这不但是在说明他的一般的写作方法，而且正是在说明“阿Q正传”。“阿Q正传”发表的时候，的确就曾有一些小政客和小官僚疑神疑鬼，以为是在讽刺他们。而且发表以后，这个共名又最先流行在知识青年中。可见作者的主观意图和作品的客观效果，都不仅仅是鞭打旧中国的落后的农民，也不仅仅是鞭打他们身上的封建思想。
    然而文学作品中的人物不能不像在真实的生活里一样，也是社会的人物。尽管鲁迅主观上是想揭露他所认为的“国民性”的弱点，但在中国的土地上却找不到一个抽象的“国民性”的代表。他选择了阿Q这样一个辛亥革命前后的雇农来作为主人公，就不可能停止于只是写他的癞疮疤，只是写他的精神胜利法，只是写他的优胜实即劣败，就不能不展开旧中国的农村的阶级关系的描写，不能不写到阿Q以外的赵太爷、赵秀才和钱假洋鬼子这样一些人物，不能不写到阿Q的受剥削和受压迫，写到他从反对造反到神往革命，不能不写到辛亥革命的不彻底，写到阿Q要求参加革命却被排斥，并且最后得到那样一个悲惨的“大团圆”的结局。这正是现实主义的巨大的胜利。这样，鲁迅的最重要的作品，五四以来最杰出的小说“阿Q正传”，它的成就就不只是创造了阿Q这个不朽的典型，而且深刻地写出了旧中国的农村的真实和资产阶级领导的旧民主主义革命的弱点。这样，阿Q就不是中国人精神方面的各种毛病的综合，不是一种精神的性格化和典型化，不是一个集合体，而是一个具体的活生生的人物，而是一个独特的存在，而是一个个性非常鲜明的典型了。从阿Q精神来说，存在在阿Q身上的是带有浓厚的农民色彩的阿Q精神，并不是各阶级的各色各样的阿Q主义，虽然它们中间有着共同之处。从农民来说，阿Q只是具有强烈的阿Q精神的农民，只是一种农民，并不是农民全体，虽然他身上有着农民的共性。曾有过这样的评论，说阿Q终于要做起革命党来，终于得到“大团圆”的结局，似乎在人格上是两个。这种评论就是由于只看到阿Q身上的阿Q精神，没有看到他是一个雇农。而鲁迅写他神往革命并且决心投降革命的时候，他又仍然是我们已经很熟习的阿Q，仍然是带着阿Q式的落后的色彩，甚至临到了最后的场面，他还“无师自通”地说了半句“过了二十年又是一个……”，虽然他这最后一次的精神胜利法的表现是那样悲怆，那样沉重，我们再也笑不出来了。所以在整篇小说中，阿Q的性格是有发展，却又仍然很统一的。只有读到他被抬上了没有篷的车，突然觉到了是要去杀头，小说中说他虽然着急，却又有些泰然，“他意思之间，似乎觉得人生天地间，大约本来有时也未免要杀头的。”接着又读到他游街示众的时候，小说中说他不知道，“但即使知道也一样，他不过以为人生天地间，大约本来有时也未免要游街要示众罢了。”那像是把士大夫的玩世思想加在他头上，我们觉得小有不安而已。
    鲁迅自己说，他写“阿Q正传”，“实不以滑稽或哀怜为目的”（“鲁迅书简”二四九页）。阿Q受到剥削和压迫，尤其是他要求参加辛亥革命而受到排斥和屠杀，都是激起我们的同情的。而且我们从阿Q这种落后的农民身上，也看到了农民的反抗性和革命性。然而，如果如有些评论者所说的那样，把阿Q精神当作一种反抗精神，或者把阿Q看作一般的弱小人物，以为鲁迅对他主要是同情或甚至喜爱，那就不但远离作者的原意，而且和作品的客观效果也不符合了。我们读“阿Q正传”的时候，是经历过这样一种感情的变化的，对阿Q最初主要是鄙视而最后却同情占了上风。这真有些像托尔斯泰对于契诃夫的“宝贝儿”所说的话一样，作者本来是打算诅咒他，结果却反倒为他祝福。但作品的主要效果和作者的目的还是一致的。在我们生活中流行的阿Q是以精神胜利法为他的性格的主要特点的阿Q，是一个谁也不愿意仿效的否定的榜样。文学上出现了阿Q，生活中就有很多很多的人再也不愿意作阿Q了。
    阿Q是一个农民，但阿Q精神却是一种消极的可耻的现象，而且不是一个阶级所特有的现象，这在理论上到底应该怎样解释呢？理论应该去说明生活中存在的复杂的现象，这样来丰富自己，而不应该把生活中的复杂的现象加以简单化，这样来勉强地适合一些现成的概念和看法。阿Q性格的解释问题，实际上是一个典型性和阶级性的关系问题。困难是从这里产生的：许多评论者的心目中好像都有这样一个想法，以为典型性就等于阶级性。然而在实际的生活中，在文学的现象中，人物的性格和阶级性之间都并不能划一个数学上的全等号。道理是很容易理解的。如果典型性完全等于阶级性，那么从每个阶级就只能写出一个典型人物，而且在阶级消灭以后，就再也写不出典型人物了。这样，文学艺术在创造人物性格方面的用武之地就异常狭小了。在阶级社会里，真实的人都是有阶级身分，因而都是有阶级性的。文学作品所描写的阶级社会的人物因而也就不能不有阶级性，而且某些典型人物的性格的确是表现了某些阶级的本质的特点。然而在同一阶级里面却有不同性格的人物，这就决定了文学从一个阶级中也可以写出多种多样的典型来。这大概谁也不会否认。生活中还有一种现象，某些性格上的特点，是可以在不同的阶级的人物身上都见到的。文学作品如果描写了这样的人物，而且突出地描写了这种特点，尽管他也有他的阶级身分和阶级性，但他性格上的这种特点却就显得不是一个阶级的现象了。诸葛亮，堂·吉诃德和阿Q都是这样的典型。诸葛亮的身分是一个封建统治阶级的知识分子和政治家，然而小说中所描写的诸葛亮的性格的最突出的特点却是他很有智慧，他能够预见。希望有智慧和预见，这就不仅仅是封建统治阶级的政治家的要求，而且也是人民的要求了。因而诸葛亮就流传在人民的口中，成为人民所喜爱的人物，并且产生了“三个臭皮匠，合成一个诸葛亮”这句歌颂集体的智慧的谚语。堂·吉诃德的身份是西班牙的乡村里面的一个旧式的地主，他的身上不但有他的阶级性，而且还有特定的时代和特定的地域的色彩。小说的情节主要是写欧洲中世纪的骑士制度已经灭亡以后，这位旧式的地主仍然要去做游侠骑士，结果得到不断的可笑的失败。堂·吉诃德的全部性格不止于此，然而小说中描写得最突出的却是这样的特点。因而这个名字流行在我们的生活中，就成了可笑的主观主义者的共名。主观主义当然不是一个阶级的现象，因而堂·吉诃德这个典型的意义就不因时代和地域的差异而丧失。阿Q也是这样。他的身分是辛亥革命前后的雇农，他的性格他的行动都强烈地带有他的阶级和时代的特有的色彩。许多评论者在说明阿Q的性格的时候，都指出了他所特有的时代背景，指出了在鸦片战争以后不断地遭到失败和屈辱的老大的大清帝国里面，阿Q精神是一种异常普遍的存在。这是对的。正是因为阿Q式的想法和说法在清末民初很流行，鲁迅才孕育了阿Q这样一个人物。然而小说中所描写的阿Q的最突出的特点，不能正视自己的弱点，而且企图用一些可耻笑的自欺欺人的想法和说法来掩饰，却是在许多不同阶级不同时代的人物身上都可以见到的。这到底应该怎样解释呢？我们知道，一切剥削阶级（并不仅仅是封建地主阶级）为了维持和巩固它们的统治，特别是当它们遭到困难和失败的时候，它们是不能公开承认它们的弱点和景况不佳，而必然会采取自欺欺人的办法来加以掩饰的。半封建半殖民地的旧中国的统治阶级及其知识分子的阿Q精神之特别浓厚，而且表现得特别畸形和丑陋，以至曾被鲁迅误认为是“国民性”，原因就在这里。像阿Q那样的劳动人民，除了劳动力而外一无所有，本来是没有忌讳自己的弱点的必要的。然而当他还不觉悟的时候，他不能不带有保守性和落后性，而这种保守和落后也就不能不阻碍他去正视、承认和克服他的弱点，而且用可笑的方法来加以掩饰了。这就是说，在人民的落后部分中间也可以产生阿Q精神的。有些评论者认为阿Q的时代过去了，阿Q精神就完全过去了，永远过去了，这并不符合客观的事实，并从而降低了阿Q这个典型的意义。在我们今天的生活中，只要碰到那种拒绝批评和自我批评、而且用一些可耻笑的想法和说法来掩饰他的缺点和错误的人，不管他的想法和说法和那个老阿Q是多么不同，我们仍然不能不叫他作“阿Q”。从日益陷于孤立和失败的帝国主义分子及其豢养的和本国人民为敌的傀儡政权中间，我们更常常听到阿Q式的叫嚣和哀鸣。“阿Q正传”的很早的评论者沈雁冰说：“我又觉得‘阿Q相’未必全然是中国民族所特具，似人类的普通弱点的一种。”（“读‘呐喊’”）这种感觉是有根据的。当然在阶级社会里，“人类的普通弱点”也不能不带上阶级的色彩，阶级的特点。在剥削阶级和劳动人民中间的主观主义和阿Q精神，是有相同之处而又有差异的。而且最重要的差别是在这里：没落时期的剥削阶级的主观主义和阿Q精神是无法去掉的，就像是它们的影子一样将要一直跟随到它们的灭亡；而劳动人民的主观主义和阿Q精神却是可以避免可以克服的，因为我们并不害怕承认我们的错误和缺点，而且我们手里高举着马克思列宁主义的武器，自我批评的武器。
    对阶级社会中的文学的现象，是必须进行阶级分析的。但如果以为仅仅依靠或者随便应用阶级和阶级性这样一些概念，就可以解决一切文学上的复杂的问题，那就大错特错了。不仅是对于阿Q的解释，在对于“红楼梦”中的刘姥姥和“西游记”中的妖魔的争论上，都曾经表现了一种简单化的倾向。刘姥姥是一个农民家庭的妇女，然而她在大观园中出现的时候，又带有女清客的气味。根据她的性格中的这个特点，于是有些人就曾经叫吴稚晖那种反动统治阶级的帮闲为“刘姥姥”。刘姥姥出现在大观园中的时候，小说又曾着重描写了她对于上层社会生活的陌生和见识不广。根据她的性格的这又一个特点，于是我们的生活中又流行着一句谚语，“刘姥姥进大观园”。不知道文学上的典型人物在我们的生活中常常只是他的性格的某一种特点在起着作用，并不是他的全部性格，而全部性格又并不全等于他的阶级性，却企图都从他的阶级身分去得到解释，因而把争论都纠缠在给人物划阶级上，这就永远也得不到正确的结论了。“西游记”的妖魔，它们很多都是由动物变成的，因而这些由动物变成的妖魔的形象首先就有一些适合它们的原形的特点。它们既是妖魔，又自然有一些妖魔的特点，如会变化和会使用法术等等。它们都会变化为人，这样就又有了人的特点。作者在描写它们身上的最后这一种特点的时候，当然是以现实中的人为模特儿的。因而可能在某些妖魔身上找得到某些类似人的阶级性的东西，但不会是一个统一的阶级的阶级性。因为作者到底是在写各种各样的妖魔，并不是在写一个统一的阶级里面的种种人物。而且如果用实事求是的态度去读“西游记”，我们还会发现和承认这样的事实：在许多妖魔身上，作者只描写了动物的特点、妖魔的特点和人的某些外表的或一般的特点，根本就找不到阶级性。总之，对于这样众多、这样来路不同而且性格也不同的妖魔，正如对于“聊斋志异”里面所描写的那些狐狸精一样，是要加以具体的研究和细致的分别的。但我们的许多评论者却硬要给这些妖魔划阶级，而且硬要把它们划成一个统一的阶级。首先是把它们都划为农民，而且都是起义的农民，于是一直为人民所喜爱的孙猴子就非成为一个镇压农民起义的封建统治阶级的爪牙不可了。后来有些评论者心中不安，又反其道而行之，于是把那些妖魔又一律定为反动的统治阶级，不是皇亲国戚就是地主恶霸。好像“西游记”的作者吴承恩并不是在写他的幻想的小说，而是在充满了神和妖魔的世界里做土地改革工作，早已心中有数地把它们的阶级成分都定好了，只等待我们来发榜一样。把阶级和阶级性的概念这样机械地简单地应用，实在只能说是对于马克思主义的嘲笑了。
    研究文学作品中的人物，正如研究生活中的问题一样，是不能从概念出发的。必须考虑到它的全部的复杂性，必须努力按照它本来的面貌和含义来加以说明，必须重视它在实际生活中所发生的作用和效果，必须联系到文学历史上的多种多样的典型人物来加以思考。这样作自然要困难得多。正是因为困难，我在这里所试为作出的对于阿Q的一点说明，和比较圆满的解释大概还是很有距离的。但是我相信，用这样的方法却可以从不圆满达到比较圆满。
