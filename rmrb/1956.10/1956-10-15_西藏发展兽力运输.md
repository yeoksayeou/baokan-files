Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Tibet is beginning to develop animal-powered transport in a planned way to promote material exchanges between towns and along highways. Currently, government offices and construction sites are manufacturing horse-drawn carts, and it is estimated that this will expand to two thousand carts by the end of this year.

In the two years since the Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet highways were opened to traffic, privately owned animal-powered vehicles have generally developed. In Lhasa alone, there are already nine hundred horse-drawn carts. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region Transportation Department has recently drafted implementation measures for the organization and management of privately-operated transport animal-powered vehicles. According to the principle of voluntary participation by cart owners, joint operations will be established to implement unified management and dispatch.

    西藏发展兽力运输
    据新华社讯　西藏地区开始有计划地发展兽力运输，以促进各城镇和公路沿线的物资交流。目前，各地机关、各个工地都在制造马拉车，预计到今年年底可以发展到两千辆。
    自康藏，青藏公路通车后的两年多来，民间的兽力车普遍有了发展，仅拉萨市就已经有了九百辆马拉车。西藏自治区筹备委员会交通处最近拟订了关于私营运输业兽力车组织管理实施办法，将根据车主自愿原则，成立联营，实行统一的管理和调度。
