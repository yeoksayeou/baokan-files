Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: In the farm of the Hubei Provincial Agricultural Comprehensive Experiment Station, a high-quality new cotton variety has achieved a bumper harvest.

	This farm cultivated this cotton in a test plot of more than 1.9 mu this year. From mid-August to now, it has harvested 620 jin of seed cotton. It is estimated that another 90 jin of seed cotton can be harvested by the end of the picking season, with an average yield of more than 370 jin of seed cotton per mu. Next to this plot, Dai Zi cotton was also cultivated at the same time. The cultivation of these two types of cotton was the same before and after planting. From the current yield per mu, the new variety is expected to increase production by more than 30% compared to Dai Zi cotton.

	This new cotton variety was discovered in 1950 in a place called "Ya Peng" in Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, so it is called "Ya Peng Cotton." After several years of cultivation and observation comparisons, "Ya Peng Cotton" has the advantages of higher yield than Dai Zi cotton, similar cotton lint length to Dai Zi cotton, and early maturity. In addition, it has the advantages of fewer vegetative branches, concentrated boll setting, suitability for dense planting and mechanized cultivation, and resistance to waterlogging and flooding.

	The Hubei Provincial Agricultural Comprehensive Experiment Station has selected many seeds from "Ya Peng Cotton" and plans to conduct key trial plantings in cotton-producing areas next year.

### 新品种“鸭棚棉”  平均亩产籽棉三百七十斤

    新品种“鸭棚棉”
    平均亩产籽棉三百七十斤
    据新华社讯　在湖北省农业综合试验站的农场里，一种质地优良的棉花新品种获得了丰收。
    这个农场今年在一亩九分多的试验田里培育这种棉花，从8月中旬到现在已收了籽花六百二十斤，预计到拣花结束时还能收籽花九十斤，平均每亩收的籽花有三百七十多斤。在紧挨着这块田边，同时培育了岱字棉。这两种棉花播种前后的耕作都做得一样，从目前每亩的收获量看，新品种要比岱字棉增产30％以上。
    这种棉花新品种是1950年在湖北省新洲县一个叫“鸭棚”的地方发现的，所以叫它“鸭棚棉”。经过几年来的培育和观察对比，“鸭棚棉”除了具有产量比岱字棉高、棉绒长度和岱字棉相近、早熟等优点外，它还有营养枝少、结铃集中，适宜于密植、机械化耕作和有抗涝耐渍等优点。
    湖北省农业综合试验站已从“鸭棚棉”中挑选了许多种子，准备明年在产棉区重点试种。
