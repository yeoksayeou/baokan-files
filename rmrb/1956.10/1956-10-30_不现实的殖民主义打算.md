Unrealistic Colonialist Designs

The despicable act of France kidnapping the leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front has aroused angry protests from Arab countries, Asian and African countries, and world public opinion. However, the French government not only rejected Morocco's legitimate demand to release the leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front, but also French troops stationed in Morocco even interfered with the protest movements of the Moroccan people, causing clashes with residents. At the same time, France, using the excuse of intercepting a ship carrying weapons off the coast of Algeria, has accused Egypt before the Security Council. This arrogant attitude of the French government has intensified the situation in North Africa and created a threat to peace.

French Prime Minister Mollet openly stated that France must maintain its influence in Algeria at all costs, and that the kidnapping of the leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front was an important measure to "pacify" Algeria. However, facts have proven that in the past two years, France's "pacification" actions of violent suppression in order to maintain its colonial rule in Algeria have suffered serious setbacks. Now, even resorting to "aerial banditry"-style kidnapping as an important "pacification" measure only further illustrates the desperate situation France has reached.

In fact, as Arab countries have pointed out, France's kidnapping is a provocation to the entire North African countries and the Arab nation. France has adopted a hostile and bellicose attitude towards Egypt's action to regain sovereignty over the Suez Canal. At the same time, after being forced to recognize the independence of Morocco and Tunisia, it still refuses to withdraw its troops from these two sovereign states, and French troops stationed in Algeria continue to violate their sovereignty. All this is not accidental. The French newspaper "Le Parisien Libéré" revealed: "We must and can demand unreserved recognition not only of our fundamental interests in Algeria, but also of our fundamental interests in Tunisia and Morocco. ...We must and can demand that in the settlement of the Suez Canal issue, full consideration should be given to the absolute necessity of France's continued presence in North Africa." The true intentions of French colonialists throughout North Africa are fully exposed.

However, there is no colonialist design more unrealistic than this outdated one. Arab countries know how to strive for and safeguard their sacred independent sovereignty. They have united to support Egypt's heroic struggle to regain the canal, and now they are protesting in unison against France's illegal act of kidnapping the leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front, and supporting peaceful efforts to end the Algerian war. Morocco and Tunisia issued a joint declaration, solemnly stating that they are "in complete solidarity with the Algerian people." The Arab League Council and the Asian-African Group at the United Nations have also strongly condemned France's perfidious behavior. In the irresistible tide of national independence movements, it would be incredibly naive for French colonialists to think they can "continue to exist in North Africa" without suffering greater defeat.

France can use incredible tricks to kidnap the leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front, but it can never destroy the strong will and power of the Algerian people to fight for national independence. Since October 31, 1954, the French forces suppressing the Algerian people have increased from the initial 200,000 to 320,000, and now to 450,000, with daily expenditures of more than one billion francs. They have used horrific means of "sweeping" peaceful villages and terrorizing residents. But what is the result? The Algerian National Liberation Army has not weakened, but strengthened; the areas of armed resistance have not shrunk, but expanded. The areas that French colonialists call "unsafe" now occupy half of Algerian territory. This proves that the just struggle of the Algerian people, supported by Arab countries and peace-loving forces around the world, can never be conquered by the declining French colonialists with force.

Under these circumstances, the Algerian question has been the most acute and urgent problem facing France in recent years. When the Mollet government came to power in February of this year, it saw the failure of the past governments' policy of armed suppression and advocated in its policy program that "negotiations must be conducted" to peacefully resolve the Algerian issue. However, eight months have passed, and what the Mollet government has engaged in is not peaceful negotiation, but the expansion of armed suppression. They attempt to rely on the "full support" of American power to achieve the goal of resolving the Algerian issue by force. But this plan of the French ruling group is just a naive and unrealizable fantasy. The fact that the United States is seizing South Vietnam and replacing France's position in North Africa has led Foreign Minister Pineau to express that "we do not want another Indochina." The development of the Suez issue also proves that the United States is adopting a double-dealing policy, which should be another profound lesson for France. What strength can France rely on to continue the colonial war in Algeria for a long time? Cool-headed French politicians are very well aware that this power does not exist.

There is only one way out, and that is to seek a peaceful solution based on respect for Algeria's independent sovereignty. There is no other way out. Prime Minister Mollet's attempt to use the unfounded statement that the situation in Algeria has improved to block the strong desire for a peaceful solution, which is widespread from parliament to the masses of the people, in order to continue the desperate colonial war, will not work. This plan will only further damage France's international prestige and position, and drive the current government towards an increasingly serious political crisis.

### 不现实的殖民主义打算

    不现实的殖民主义打算
    法国绑架阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线领导人的卑劣行径，已激起了阿拉伯国家、亚非国家和全世界公众舆论的愤怒抗议。但是法国政府不仅拒绝摩洛哥提出的释放阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线领导人的正当要求，而且法国驻在摩洛哥的军队竟对摩洛哥群众的抗议运动进行干预，同居民发生冲突。同时，法国还借口在阿尔及利亚沿岸扣留了一艘载有武器的船只而向安理会控诉埃及。法国政府的这种横蛮态度，使北非局势趋于紧张，造成了对和平的威胁。
    法国总理摩勒公然说，法国无论如何要保持它在阿尔及利亚的势力，而绑架阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线领导人则是什么“绥靖”阿尔及利亚的重要措施。但是，事实证明，两年来法国为了保持在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治，采取暴力镇压的“绥靖”行动，已经遭到了严重的挫折，而今居然把“空中强盗”式的绑架手段也看作重要的“绥靖”措施，只是进一步说明法国已到了怎样饥不择食的狼狈境遇。
    事实上，正如阿拉伯国家所指斥的，法国这次的绑架行为，是对整个北非国家和阿拉伯民族的挑衅。法国对埃及收回苏伊士运河的主权行动，采取了敌视的好战的态度；同时，它在被迫承认了摩洛哥和突尼斯的独立以后，仍然拒绝从这两个主权国家撤退驻军，法国驻阿尔及利亚的军队还不断侵犯它们的主权，这都不是偶然的。法国“解放了的巴黎人报”透露说：“我们必需而且也能够要求毫无保留地不仅承认我们在阿尔及利亚的基本利益，而且承认我们在突尼斯和摩洛哥的基本利益。……我们必须而且能够要求在苏伊士运河问题的解决上，应该对法国在北非继续存在下去的绝对必要性予以充分的考虑”。法国殖民主义者在整个北非的真正意图，于此暴露无遗。
    但是，再没有比这个过时了的殖民主义打算更加不现实的了。阿拉伯国家知道怎样争取和维护它们的神圣的独立主权。他们已经团结起来，支持埃及收回运河的英勇斗争，现在他们又齐声抗议法国绑架阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线领导人的非法行为，支持谋求结束阿尔及利亚战争的和平努力。摩洛哥和突尼斯发表了联合宣言，严正地表示他们“同阿尔及利亚人民完全团结一致”。阿拉伯联盟理事会和联合国亚非集团也都严厉地谴责了法国的背信弃义行为。在这种不可抗拒的民族独立运动的怒潮中，法国殖民主义者认为他们还可以“在北非继续存在下去”，而不致遭到更大的失败，那就未免天真得惊人了。
    法国能够用难以置信的诡计绑架阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的领导人，但是它决不能摧毁阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的强大意志和力量。自从1954年10月31日起，法国镇压阿尔及利亚人民的武装力量，已由最初的二十万，增加到三十二万，现在已增加到了四十五万，每日的消耗在十亿法郎以上，并使用了惨绝人寰的“扫荡”和平乡村和居民的恐怖手段，但是，结果怎样呢？阿尔及利亚民族解放军不是削弱了，而是增强了，武装反抗地区不是缩小了，而是扩大了。法国殖民主义者称为“不安全的地区”，已占阿尔及利亚土地的一半。这证明有着阿拉伯国家和全世界和平力量支持的阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争，决不是没落的法国殖民主义者能够用武力征服得了的。
    在这种情况下，近年来阿尔及利亚问题一直是法国面临的最尖锐和急待解决的问题。摩勒政府在今年2月上台时看到了过去历届政府的武力镇压政策的失败，曾经在施政纲领中主张“必须进行谈判”，以和平解决阿尔及利亚问题。可是，八个月过去了，摩勒政府所从事的不是和平谈判，而是扩大武力镇压。它们企图依借美国力量的“完全支持”，来达到武力解决阿尔及利亚问题的目的。但是法国统治集团的这种打算，只是天真的、不能实现的幻想。美国夺取南越和正在北非取代法国地位的事实，曾使得比诺外长也不能不表示“我们不希望有另一个印度支那”。苏伊士问题的发展，也证明美国采取的是两面三刀的政策，这对法国说来应该是又一个深刻的教训。法国还能够凭借什么力量使它可以在阿尔及利亚把殖民战争长久地继续下去呢？法国冷静的政治家都非常清楚地知道，这种力量是不存在的。
    出路只有一条，这就是在尊重阿尔及利亚的独立主权的基础上谋求和平解决。别的出路是没有的。摩勒总理想用所谓阿尔及利亚的情况已经改善的毫无根据的话，来堵塞从议会到人民群众广泛要求和平解决的强烈愿望，以便继续进行绝望的殖民战争，这是行不通的。这种打算只有进一步损害法国的国际威信和地位，并使现政府走向日益严重的政治危机。
