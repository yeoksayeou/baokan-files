Xinhua News Agency, Bristol, 21st: Labour Party left-wing leader Aneurin Bevan criticized Britain's "docile" attitude towards the United States at a meeting of the Engineers' Union in Bristol on the evening of October 20th.

Bevan was delivering his first speech since being elected Labour Party Treasurer.

He said that Britain had fallen into serious economic and military difficulties as a result of being "excessively docile in following American leadership."

Bevan called for expanding British trade with China and the Soviet Union. He said that the time had come for Britain to tell the United States "that we will renounce any guarantees we have given not to trade with Russia and China in the coming years."

He said, why should Britain and the Commonwealth countries cut off their trade with 600 million Chinese people? This is because Britain allows the United States to dictate its policies, and Britain is not economically interdependent with the United States.

Bevan criticized the plan to establish a "European Common Market" as "a staggering piece of stupidity." He said that Britain is an industrial country, and its "natural customers and partners are those parts of the world that have not yet developed to the same level as us."

    比万发表演说指出：
    英国由于追随美国吃尽苦头
    并要求扩大同中苏两国的贸易
    新华社21日讯　布利斯托尔消息：英国工党左翼领袖比万10月20日晚间在布利斯托尔一次工程师工会的集会上批评英国对美国“驯服”的态度。
    比万是在当选工党司库后第一次发表演说。
    他说，英国由于在“追随美国领导方面过份驯服”，结果使自己陷入了严重的经济和军事困难。
    比万要求扩大英国同中苏两国的贸易。他说，现在时机已经到来：英国必须告诉美国“我们将要解除我们答应过的在今后几年内不同俄国和中国贸易的任何保证”。
    他说，为什么英国和英联邦国家要割断它们同六亿中国人的贸易呢？这是因为英国容许美国对它的政策发号施令，而英国在经济上同美国这个国家并不是互通有无的。
    比万批评建立“欧洲共同市场”的计划是“一件令人吃惊的蠢事”。他说，英国是一个工业国家，它的“天然顾客和合伙人是世界上那些还没有发展到同我们的水平一样的地方”。
