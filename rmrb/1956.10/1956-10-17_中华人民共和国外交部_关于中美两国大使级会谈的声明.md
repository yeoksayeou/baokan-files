Xinhua News Agency, October 16th -- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on October 16th regarding the ambassadorial talks between China and the United States. The full text is as follows:

    In view of the United States' insistence on a position that infringes upon Chinese sovereignty and interferes in China's internal affairs regarding the issue of non-use of force between China and the United States, which has led to a prolonged stalemate in the Sino-US ambassadorial talks, in order to promote the progress of the talks, after the US side refused to discuss our proposed plan for lifting the embargo, the Chinese side proposed a draft agreement on promoting people-to-people exchanges and cultural exchange between China and the United States on September 22, 1956, as follows:

    "In order to promote mutual understanding between the people of China and the United States, and to restore the traditional friendship between the people of China and the United States,

    Ambassador Wang Bingnan, on behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China, and Ambassador Johnson, on behalf of the government of the United States of America, agree and declare:

    The People's Republic of China and the United States of America will each take the initiative to take measures to eliminate the obstacles that currently impede the free exchange of people and cultural exchanges between the two countries."

    As everyone knows, the Chinese side has made considerable efforts to promote people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and the United States. For example, recently the Chinese government approved the requests of many American journalists to visit China. From the enthusiastic welcome expressed by the American press, it can be seen that this action taken by the Chinese side is in line with the deep desire of the American people to understand China. As far as the Sino-US talks are concerned, if the two sides can reach an agreement on these relatively easy-to-resolve issues, it will not only open the way for contact between the people of China and the United States, but will certainly improve the atmosphere of the Sino-US talks and help to resolve other contentious issues between China and the United States.

    However, the United States has refused to discuss the Chinese proposal on promoting people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and the United States, citing as excuses that the two sides have not yet reached an agreement on the issue of non-use of force and that there are still a few Americans who committed crimes in China serving sentences in China. This statement by the United States is completely untenable. The Chinese side has stated more than once that it is the United States that has obstructed the two sides from reaching an agreement on the issue of non-use of force and violated the implementation of the agreement on the return of civilians of both sides. At the same time, everyone knows that these issues, in any sense, have no reason to become obstacles to the development of people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and the United States. The attitude taken by the United States can only show that it deliberately wants to prevent any progress in the Sino-US ambassadorial talks and is afraid of any improvement in Sino-US relations. We believe that this attitude of the United States is completely contrary to the wishes of the vast majority of people in the world, including the American people.

### 中华人民共和国外交部  关于中美两国大使级会谈的声明

    中华人民共和国外交部
    关于中美两国大使级会谈的声明
    新华社16日讯　中华人民共和国外交部16日发表关于中美两国大使级会谈的声明，全文如下：
    鉴于美国在关于中美两国不使用武力的问题上坚持侵犯中国主权和干涉中国内政的立场，使中美大使级会谈陷于长期拖延的局面。为了促进会谈的进展，中国方面在美方拒绝讨论我方提出的关于解除禁运方案以后，又在1956年9月22日提出了关于促进中美人民来往和文化交流的协议声明草案如下：
    “为了促进中美两国人民之间的相互了解，为了恢复中美两国人民之间的传统友谊，
    王炳南大使代表中华人民共和国政府，约翰逊大使代表美利坚合众国政府，协议声明：
    中华人民共和国和美利坚合众国将各自主动采取措施，来消除目前阻碍他们两国人民自由来往和进行文化交流的障碍。”
    大家知道，中国方面在促进中美两国的人民来往和文化交流方面曾经作了不少努力，例如前不久中国政府就批准了许多美国记者访问中国的要求，从美国新闻界所表示的热烈欢迎的态度中，可以看出中国方面采取的这一行动是符合于美国人民要求了解中国的深切愿望的。就中美会谈而言，如果双方能对这些比较容易解决的问题达成协议，那就将不仅打开中美两国人民之间接触的道路，而且肯定地还会改善中美会谈的气氛，有助于中美间其他有所争执的问题的解决。
    但是，美国方面却以双方还未对不使用武力问题达成协议和还有少数在中国犯法的美国人在中国服刑为借口拒绝讨论中国方面提出的关于促进中美人民来往和文化交流的建议。美国方面的这种说法是完全站不住的，对此中国方面曾经不止一次地说明正是美国方面阻挠了双方对不使用武力问题达成协议和违反了关于双方平民回国问题的协议的执行。同时，谁都知道，这些问题在任何意义上都没有理由成为开展中美人民来往和文化交流的障碍。美国采取这种态度只能表明它蓄意要使中美大使级会谈得不到任何进展，害怕中美关系得到任何改善。我们相信，美国的这种态度是完全违反广大世界人民，包括美国人民在内的愿望的。
