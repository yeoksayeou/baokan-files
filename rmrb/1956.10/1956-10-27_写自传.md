Writing a Self-Criticism
    Lu Ying
    A district cadre, in mobilizing a new middle peasant to continue investing in the advanced cooperative, used the method of "writing a self-criticism." When the district committee inspected for "coercive orders," he used this contrary example as a typical report, almost promoting it.

    District Cadre: Our cooperative's foundation is weak in its first year. How can we manage without everyone's investment? Others (he named names) took all the fodder and seeds, and even took cash. See if you can offer anything else?
    New Middle Peasant: I took all the fodder and seeds...
    District Cadre: I know, I know. I mean, add some more, the more the better. What about your cash?
    New Middle Peasant: (Sincerely) I don't have any. To be honest, I'm broke.
    District Cadre: (Confidently) What happened to the jewelry your wife received during land reform?
              (Referring to silver ornaments)
    New Middle Peasant: (Looking embarrassed) Would they be willing?
    District Cadre: (Changing his mind) Alright, then, there's no coercion. If you're willing, you're willing. If not, fine, let's talk about the second issue. Now the higher-ups want to understand the situation of each member of the advanced cooperative. You need to write a self-criticism.
    New Middle Peasant: (Confused) How do I write it?
    District Cadre: It's not difficult. I'll give you three points. First, what have you been doing from the age of eight until now? Second, a comparison of your life before and after the land reform. Third, what are your understanding and impressions of the advanced cooperative? Just three points, no more, no less. Give it to me tomorrow.
    The new middle peasant returned home and discussed it with his neighbors, who had never heard of writing a self-criticism. Smart people reminded him that this was still about getting him to invest. He also realized that this was not a second issue at all. After an argument, he prepared to take out his wife's meager silver ornaments. The next day, he went back to the district cadre.

    New Middle Peasant: I've thought it through. I can't write the self-criticism. As for the investment, whatever you want, I'll give it.
    District Cadre: (Smiling) Oh, you can't write it. Then we agree, your investment is voluntary, we didn't use coercion? Say it!
    New Middle Peasant: (Resignedly repeating) No coercion.

    When this story reached the county committee, the county committee pointed out that this was also a coercive order, but a more civilized example. They also criticized the district committee for planning to promote it. The district committee sighed and said: We didn't see it, this is really a matter of competence. The county committee also sighed and said: Alas, competence, what else is lacking besides competence?

    写自传
    鹿影
    一个区干部动员一个新中农继续向高级社投资，用了“写自传”的办法，在区委检查“强迫命令”时，他以相反的例子作了典型报告，几乎推广开去。
    区　干：咱们社第一年底子薄，不靠大伙投资怎行？别人（他举出了名字）草料、种籽全拿了，还拿了现款，你瞧瞧还能拿点什么？
    新中农：草料、籽种我全拿了。……
    区　干：我知道，我知道。我的意思是再添一些，多多益善，你的现款呢？
    新中农：（诚恳地）没有。不瞒你说，我手头发死。
    区　干：（胸有成竹）土地改革的时候分给你媳妇那些挂的戴的
              （指银器）到那儿去了？
    新中农：（面有难色）那她们会肯么？
    区　干：（变了主意）那好吧，现在不带强迫命令，你肯就肯，不肯就罢，好说话。我们来谈第二个问题。现在上级要了解每个高级社社员的情况，你要写个自传。
    新中农：（惶惑地）怎么写呢？
    区　干：不难。我给你出三条提纲。第一条，你八岁到现在尽做些啥？第二条，土地改革翻身前后的生活对比。第三条，对高级社的认识和印象怎样？就三条，不能多也不能少，你明天交给我。
    新中农回到家里，和邻居们一嘀咕，还都没听说有写自传的事。聪明的人都提醒他：这还是要他投资。他自己也领悟到这不是什么第二个问题。在一场争吵以后，准备把媳妇一点可怜的银器拿出来。第二天他又到那个区干部那儿去。
    新中农：我思想通了。自传我不能写。投资的事你要什么我给
              什么。
    区　干：（笑了）呵，不能写。那我们说好，投资是你自愿的，咱们没带强迫？你说！
    新中农：（无奈地学舌）没带强迫。
    这个故事传到县委，县委指出这也是强迫命令，不过是比较文明的例子；并且指责区委不该准备推广。区委叹息着说：我们没看出来，这真是水平问题哪。县委也叹息着说：唉，水平哪，除了水平还缺点什么呢？
