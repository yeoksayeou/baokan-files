Comrades, friends:

The great writer and revolutionary, Mr. Lu Xun, has been gone from us for a full twenty years. He struggled throughout his life for the cause of the Chinese nation's liberation and the cause of the Chinese people's liberation. He began as a patriot and a democrat, and finally accepted Marxism. Comrade Mao Zedong made an extremely high assessment of Mr. Lu Xun. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Lu Xun was the champion of the Chinese cultural revolution. He was not only a great writer but also a great thinker and a great revolutionary." "Lu Xun was an unprecedented national hero on the cultural front, representing the majority of the nation, charging forward against the enemy most correctly, bravely, resolutely, faithfully, and enthusiastically."

When Mr. Lu Xun passed away, our motherland was in a state of profound suffering. At that time, Japanese imperialists were attempting to annex all of China, while the Kuomintang reactionaries were still engaged in the so-called "suppression of the Communists" and prohibited the people's anti-Japanese movement. Over the past twenty years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have defeated Japanese imperialism, defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries supported by American imperialism, completed China's bourgeois democratic revolution, and basically completed China's socialist revolution. Mr. Lu Xun once praised socialist Soviet Union, saying, "A brand new, truly unprecedented social system has emerged from hell, and hundreds of millions of people have become masters of their own destiny." Now, this sentence has become a portrayal of our country's reality. The Chinese revolution, which Mr. Lu Xun pursued throughout his life but did not personally see its success, has been realized! The Chinese people have stood up! The socialist system has been established! A more prosperous and happier future is within sight! Six hundred million people have been liberated from hell, have taken control of their own destiny, and are now, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, carrying out the great work of socialist construction to build our country into an industrialized socialist nation.

Revolutionary literature is literature that serves revolutionary political tasks, literature that serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Mr. Lu Xun regarded literature as a weapon for the oppressed people to carry out their resistance struggles. He once said, "Revolutionary writers, at the very least, must share their lives with the revolution or deeply feel the pulse of the revolution."

Our political tasks in the past were to realize two revolutions, namely, the bourgeois democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. Revolutionary literature, with Mr. Lu Xun as its banner, played a tremendous role in these two revolutionary periods. The Chinese people cherish grateful feelings for this revolutionary literature, because it can inspire the people to carry out revolutionary struggles and achieve victory. Mr. Lu Xun will always be loved by the Chinese people, and his name will be immortal.

Now, we still have the task of liberating Taiwan, the task of thoroughly completing the socialist transformation, and the task of eliminating the remaining counter-revolutionary forces, but our main political task is socialist construction. For the sake of construction, we also need to strive for a long-term peaceful environment. All literary and art workers in the country must inherit Mr. Lu Xun's spirit, actively participate in this struggle for construction, and the struggle for peace. Like Mr. Lu Xun, we must firmly stand together with the masses of the people and dedicate our strength to the great cause of construction and the cause of peace.

The Chinese Communist Party has put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" in order to mobilize all positive factors in literary and artistic work and scientific work to build our motherland.

Revolutionary artists must learn from Mr. Lu Xun's spirit of charging forward against the enemy, and at the same time learn from Mr. Lu Xun's spirit of stressing unity with comrades and friends. We must wage a resolute struggle against incorrigible counter-revolutionaries, whether in the past, present, or future. But we must resolutely implement the policy of unity towards comrades and friends. Comrades and friends should criticize each other, and this criticism should be done. Without criticism, our cause will not develop. However, this criticism should be for the purpose of unity, and not for any other purpose. Revolutionary artists should not have the "narrower mind than Baiyi Xiushi Wang Lun" that Mr. Lu Xun criticized towards political comrades and friends, and should not be like the "fake foreign devils" that Mr. Lu Xun ridiculed, who do not allow others to make revolution.

In his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in 1942, Comrade Mao Zedong said the following about the united front in literary and art circles: "Literature and art are subordinate to politics, and the first fundamental issue of Chinese politics today is the War of Resistance Against Japan. Therefore, the Party's literary and art workers should first unite with all writers and artists outside the Party (from the Party's sympathizers, petty-bourgeois writers and artists to all bourgeois and landlord-class writers and artists who support the War of Resistance Against Japan) on the point of resisting Japan. Secondly, they should unite on the point of democracy; on this point, some anti-Japanese writers and artists do not agree, so the scope of unity will inevitably be smaller. Thirdly, they should unite on the special issues of literary and art circles—artistic methods and artistic styles; we advocate socialist realism, and some people do not agree, so the scope of this unity will be even smaller. There is unity on one issue, and there is struggle and criticism on another. The various issues are separate and related to each other, so that even on the issue of producing unity, such as the issue of resisting Japan, there is also struggle and criticism at the same time. In a united front, it is wrong to have only unity and no struggle, or only struggle and no unity, to practice right-leaning capitulationism and tailism, or 'left'-leaning exclusivism and sectarianism, as some comrades have done in the past. This is true in politics, and it is also true in art."

Now, the first fundamental issue of Chinese politics is socialist construction, to build our country into a prosperous and strong socialist country. Our Party's literary and art workers should unite with all patriotic writers and artists outside the Party, should unite with all writers and artists who support socialism, and should allow the coexistence and competition of various different creative methods and artistic schools in art . We believe that socialist realism is the best creative method, but socialist realism is fundamentally incompatible to dogmatism and sectarianism. Dogmatism and sectarianism are detrimental to socialism and violate realism. The Party's literary and art workers and socialist realist writers and artists should become the core of unity, to unite others, help others, and humbly learn from others' strengths. All those who do this are right. Those who do not do this, whether right or "left," are wrong.

We hope that all old and new writers and artists in the country, including writers and artists in Taiwan, will unite under the slogan of patriotism!

We should unite with the artists of Asia, Africa, and Latin America under the slogan of opposing colonialism!

We should unite with the artists of all countries in the world under the slogan of safeguarding peace!

Long live the banner of Lu Xun's revolutionary literature!

### 在首都的鲁迅逝世二十周年纪念大会上  陆定一的讲话

    在首都的鲁迅逝世二十周年纪念大会上
    陆定一的讲话同志们，朋友们：
    伟大的文学家和革命家鲁迅先生，离开我们已经整整二十年了。他为中国民族的解放事业，为中国人民的解放事业奋斗了一生。他从一个爱国主义者，一个民主主义者开始，最后接受了马克思主义的思想。毛泽东同志对鲁迅先生作了极其崇高的估价。毛泽东同志说：“鲁迅是中国文化革命的主将，他不但是伟大的文学家，而且是伟大的思想家和伟大的革命家”。“鲁迅是在文化战线上，代表全民族的大多数，向着敌人冲锋陷阵的最正确、最勇敢、最坚决、最忠实、最热忱的空前的民族英雄。”
    鲁迅先生逝世的时候，我们的祖国正处在深重的苦难之中。当时，日本帝国主义者正在企图并吞全中国，而国民党反动派还在进行所谓“剿共”的战争，和禁止人民的抗日运动。二十年来，中国人民在中国共产党的领导之下，已经打败了日本帝国主义，打败了美国帝国主义所支持的国民党反动派，完成了中国的资产阶级民主主义的革命，并且基本上完成了中国的社会主义革命。鲁迅先生曾经赞美社会主义的苏联说：“一个簇新的，真正空前的社会制度从地狱里涌现而出，几万万的群众自己做了支配自己命运的人。”现在，这句话成了对我国现实的写照。鲁迅先生所毕生追求而没有亲自看到它的成功的中国革命，已经实现了！中国人民已经站起来了！社会主义的社会制度已经建立起来！更加幸福更加繁荣的前景已经望得到了！六万万人民，从地狱里解放了出来，自己掌握了自己的命运，现在正在中国共产党领导之下，进行着伟大的社会主义建设的工作，要把我们的国家建设成为一个工业化的社会主义的国家。
    革命的文学，是为革命的政治任务服务的文学，是为工农兵服务的文学。鲁迅先生把文学当作被压迫人民进行反抗斗争的武器。他曾经说：“革命的文学家，至少是必须和革命共同着生命，或深切地感受着革命的脉搏的。”
    我们的政治任务，过去曾经是实现两个革命，即是资产阶级民主主义的革命，和社会主义的革命。以鲁迅先生为旗帜的革命文学，曾经在这两个革命的时期中起了巨大的作用。中国人民对于这种革命文学怀着感激的心情，因为这种革命文学能够鼓舞人民去进行革命斗争，并且取得胜利。鲁迅先生将永远受到中国人民的爱戴，他的名字将永垂不朽。
    现在，我们还有解放台湾的任务，还有彻底完成社会主义改造的任务，还有肃清反革命残余势力的任务，但是，我们的主要的政治任务已经是社会主义建设。为了建设，我们还要争取一个长期的和平环境。全国的文学艺术工作者，要继承鲁迅先生的精神，积极参加这个为建设的斗争，为和平的斗争。要像鲁迅先生一样，坚决地和人民大众在一起，把自己的力量供献给伟大的建设事业和和平事业。
    中国共产党提出了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，就是为了动员文学艺术工作和科学工作方面的一切积极因素，来建设我们的祖国。
    革命的文艺家，要学习鲁迅先生向敌人冲锋陷阵的精神，同时要学习鲁迅先生对同志和朋友讲团结的精神。对怙恶不悛的反革命分子，不论过去、现在和将来，我们是必须进行坚决斗争的。但是对同志和朋友，我们必须坚决实行团结的政策。同志和朋友，相互之间是有批评的，这种批评是应该做的。没有批评，我们的事业就不会发展。但是，这种批评应该是为了团结的目的，而不是为了别的目的。革命的文艺家，对于政治上的同志和朋友，不应该有鲁迅先生所斥责的“比白衣秀士王伦还要狭小的气魄”，不应该像鲁迅先生所嘲笑的“假洋鬼子”那样不准别人革命。
    毛泽东同志1942年“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中，关于文艺界的统一战线问题曾经说过：“文艺服从于政治，今天中国政治的第一个根本问题是抗日，因此党的文艺工作者首先应该在抗日这一点上和党外的一切文学家艺术家（从党的同情分子、小资产阶级的文艺家到一切赞成抗日的资产阶级地主阶级的文艺家）团结起来。其次，应该在民主一点上团结起来；在这一点上，有一部分抗日的文艺家就不赞成，因此团结的范围就不免要小一些。再其次，应该在文艺界的特殊问题——艺术方法艺术作风一点上团结起来；我们是主张社会主义的现实主义的，又有一部分人不赞成，这个团结的范围会更小些。在一个问题上有团结，在另一个问题上就有斗争，有批评。各个问题是彼此分开而又联系着的，因而就在产生团结的问题比如抗日的问题上也同时有斗争，有批评。在一个统一战线里面，只有团结而无斗争，或者只有斗争而无团结，实行如过去某些同志所实行过的右倾的投降主义、尾巴主义，或者‘左’倾的排外主义，宗派主义，都是错误的政策。政治上如此，艺术上也是如此。”
    现在，中国政治的第一个根本问题是社会主义建设，是把我国建设成为繁荣富强的社会主义国家。我们党的文艺工作者，应该同一切具有爱国思想的党外的文学家艺术家团结起来，应该同一切赞成社会主义的文学家艺术家团结起来，在艺术上应该允许各种不同创作方法、不同艺术流派的并存和竞赛。我们相信，社会主义现实主义是最好的一种创作方法，但是社会主义现实主义是与教条主义和宗派主义根本不能相容的。教条主义和宗派主义是既不利于社会主义，又违反现实主义的。党的文艺工作者和社会主义现实主义的文学家艺术家，应当成为团结的核心，去团结别人，帮助别人，并且虚心学习别人的长处。一切这样做的，就是对的。不这样做，不论是右的或者“左”的，都是不对的。
    我们希望全国一切老的和新的文学家艺术家，包括在台湾的文学家艺术家在内，在爱国的口号下团结起来！
    我们应该同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国的文艺家，在反对殖民主义的口号下团结起来！
    我们应该同全世界各国的文艺家，在维护和平的口号下团结起来！
    鲁迅的革命文学的旗帜万岁！
