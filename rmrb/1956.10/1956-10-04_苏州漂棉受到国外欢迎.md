    Suzhou Bleached Cotton Welcomed Abroad

    (Our report) The bleached cotton produced by the Suzhou Joint State-Private Da Hua Bleached Cotton Factory is known for its white color and high quality, and is well-received by people in Southeast Asia, Western Europe, and other countries. The bleached cotton produced by this factory accounts for more than 70% of China's total bleached cotton exports.

    Bleached cotton is made from waste cotton batting after cleaning and processing. Exporting one ton of bleached cotton can be exchanged for two tons of steel. Bleached cotton has a wide range of uses and is used not only in medicine but also as a raw material for chemical industries such as explosives and plastics. It is understood that a considerable portion of Suzhou's bleached cotton is shipped to Japan, where it is woven into carpets by the Japanese people. These carpets are inexpensive and of good quality, and are very popular.

    Bleached cotton production has a history of over twenty years in Suzhou, but it did not develop before liberation. After liberation, the People's Government assisted in opening up sales channels and provided processing orders, reversing the production situation. Especially after the joint state-private ownership, with the increase in export tasks, the originally seasonal workers have been fixed to produce throughout the year. Currently, preparations are being made to start three shifts of production, marking an unprecedented boom in bleached cotton production.

    苏州漂棉受到国外欢迎
    本报讯　苏州市公私合营大华漂棉厂生产的漂棉色泽白、质量好，受到南洋、西欧等国家人民的好评。这个厂出产的漂棉约占我国整个漂棉出口总数的70％以上。
    漂棉，是废旧棉絮经过清洁处理而制成的。出口一吨漂棉，可以换回二吨钢材，漂棉的用途很广，除在医药事业上使用以外，还可以做炸药、塑胶等化学工业原料。据了解，苏州市的漂棉，有不少一部分运往日本以后，还被日本人民织成地毯，价廉物美，很受欢迎。
    漂棉生产在苏州已有二十余年的历史，但解放前一直没有得到发展。解放后，人民政府协助打开销路，给予加工订货，扭转了生产局面。特别是公私合营以后，随着出口任务的增加，本来季节性生产的工人，已固定下来全年生产，目前还在准备开三班生产，出现了漂棉生产上从未有过的繁荣景象。
