Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 16th: In Hunan Province, over 45,000 agricultural cooperatives are vigorously developing diversified operations by taking advantage of the slack season before the late rice harvest. Xiangtan Prefecture has already found more than 180 ways to engage in sideline occupations. The various sideline businesses operated by the eleven counties of Liuyang, Pingjiang, etc., in this prefecture have already generated a net income of more than 18 million yuan. In Changde Prefecture, cash income of 1.53 million yuan was also generated within 20 days.

The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a special conference on diversified operations of agricultural cooperatives in September, emphasizing the implementation of the policy of comprehensively developing production, requiring all localities to focus on agriculture and vigorously develop diversified operations in accordance with local conditions, so that more than 90% of members of bumper harvest cooperatives can increase their income, reduced production cooperatives can make up for all or part of their losses, and severely affected cooperatives can be self-sufficient through production. After the meeting, all localities took measures to help farmers develop cash crops and sideline production. At present, agricultural cooperatives in all localities have revised their agricultural and sideline production plans, and have uniformly arranged labor, reserving a certain amount of labor time for members to engage in household sideline occupations.

In order to strengthen leadership, the local Party committees and county committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province have established sideline production offices, and each township and agricultural cooperative has also designated special personnel to be responsible. The financial and economic departments have, based on specific circumstances, raised the purchase prices of some local and special products, initially changing the phenomenon of grading down and price suppression in past purchases. Many counties have also held economic integration meetings, enabling relevant departments to sign production, supply, and marketing integration contracts with agricultural cooperatives to provide specific guidance on production, in order to avoid the phenomenon of blindly developing sideline occupations.

"Extract Gold from the Fields, Pan for Treasure in the Mountains, Scoop Silver from the Streams"
Zhejiang Farmers Develop Sideline Occupations in Accordance with Local Conditions

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 16th: "Extract gold from the fields, pan for treasure in the mountains, scoop silver from the streams." This is the slogan put forward by the farmers of Daqing Township, Fuyang County, in developing diversified operations. Like Daqing Township, this kind of diversified production movement has been vigorously launched in more than half of the cooperatives in Zhejiang Province.

At present, in the plains of Zhejiang Province, the expansion of vegetable planting and the development of animal husbandry, in the mountainous areas, the digging of medicinal materials and the burning of charcoal bricks and tiles, in the coastal areas, the catching of fish and shrimp, as well as the restoration and development of handicrafts and sideline occupations in various places, have all been relatively rapid. Since the implementation of diversified production in Hang County, the county has increased the breeding of more than 100,000 ducks and expanded the planting of vegetables by more than 30,000 mu. Since September, farmers in Lin'an County have increased their income by more than 300,000 yuan due to the development of diversified operations. 69% of the advanced cooperatives in Jiande Prefecture have obtained new income from diversified production. Before the implementation of diversified operations in the 145 cooperatives in Chengguan District of Shangyu County, only 84 cooperatives could guarantee increased income for 90% of their members, but now the number that can meet this standard has increased to 103, and other cooperatives can also achieve increased income for 80% of their members.

Zhejiang Province is a region with more mountains and less farmland, and insufficient cultivated land, with an average of only 1.7 mu of land per agricultural population. This region has abundant resources and rich production content, and farmers have always had the tradition of engaging in diversified production.

Members of Mountainous Agricultural Cooperatives in Ruijin County Collect Industrial Raw Materials such as Litsea Cubeba Seeds

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 16th: Mountainous agricultural cooperatives in Ruijin County, the old revolutionary base area, have organized female members to collect a large number of industrial raw materials such as litsea cubeba seeds, nine-layered bark, and paulownia bark. According to statistics from the Ruijin County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in the past month or so, it has purchased more than 65,000 jin of litsea cubeba seeds, nine-layered bark, and paulownia bark, and the income of farmers from this item has reached more than 9,000 yuan.

Litsea cubeba seeds can be steamed and boiled into litsea cubeba oil, which is the raw material oil for making new drug perfumes, soaps, and soda. The purchasing personnel stationed in Ruijin County by the Shanghai Chemical Raw Materials Company said that the litsea cubeba seeds found in the mountainous area of Ruijin County, after testing, contain a large amount of lemon and are of good quality. Nine-layered bark and paulownia bark are raw materials for papermaking.

Gaoqiao Agricultural Cooperative Inspects Diversified Operations and Overcomes Cadres' Complacency

Xinhua News Agency, Guilin, 16th: The Gaoqiao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Luzhai County, Guangxi Province, recently inspected the implementation of the development plan for diversified operations, overcame the complacency of cadres, and made sideline production more active.

This cooperative has 32 diversified operations, with a planned total output value of more than 71,500 yuan for the autumn and winter seasons. Since the implementation of the plan, diversified operations have achieved some results. Under these circumstances, the cooperative cadres believed that the members' oil, salt, small dishes, and pocket money could all be covered by the cooperative. However, in reality, due to lack of experience and improper management, some projects, such as the planned planting of radishes and garlic, were expected to reduce income by more than 6,900 yuan due to missed seasons or drought. Members were worried about whether the planned total output value could be realized.

Recently, at the suggestion of the members, the cadres of the cooperative inspected the implementation of the production plan item by item and found that eight items in the diversified operations plan could not be completed. Only then did they overcome their complacency. Based on this situation, the cooperative management committee re-examined the plan and decided to make full use of favorable conditions, requiring the twelve productions that could over-fulfill the plan to strive for further expansion. For example, in the fish farming in ponds, as long as a few more management personnel are added and more green grass feed is provided, the fish will grow fatter and can increase production by 5,000 jin, earning more than 1,700 yuan, compared to the original plan. Coupled with the newly opened production avenues, the total value of sideline production in the entire cooperative is expected to be fully realized.

These active measures were quickly accepted by the members. Now, various sideline productions are more active than before.

Autumn Hunting Begins in Mountainous Areas of Fujian

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 16th: It is the time when rice ears ripen and sweet potatoes form tubers in the mountainous areas of Fujian, and wild animals are more rampant in damaging crops. Hunters in various places have begun autumn hunting and are showing their skills.

Thirty counties in western and northern Fujian have organized more than 2,400 hunting teams. Their achievements in the past month or so are: killing more than 3,500 wild animals such as tigers, leopards, wild boars, hedgehogs, muntjacs, and goats, and also eliminating a large number of field mice.

The number of hunting teams established in various places this year has increased significantly compared to last year. In addition to digging animal traps, setting吊绳(diao sheng - snares), installing landmines, making animal cages, and making "sugar-coated bullets" (wrapping animal bombs in food bait) to hunt and kill wild animals, they also often go up the mountains to suppress animals. In areas where wild animals often appear, joint defenses have also been established between townships, and once animal tracks are discovered, they wade across rivers and cross mountains to track and pursue them.

The hunting teams not only protect people, livestock, and crops, but also increase their income by selling their catches.

    农业社的多种经营越来越活跃
    湖南省四万五千多个农业社
    利用农闲季节开展多种经营
    新华社长沙16日电　湖南省四万五千多个农业社正利用晚稻收割前的农闲季节，大力开展多种经营。湘潭专区已经找到的副业门路共有一百八十多种，这个专区的浏阳、平江等十一个县经营的各种副业已获得纯收入一千八百多万元。常德专区在二十多天内也收入现金一百五十三万元。
    中共湖南省委曾在9月间专门召开农业社多种经营会议，强调贯彻全面发展生产的方针，要求各地以农业为主，因地制宜地大力开展多种经营，使丰收社达到90％以上的社员增加收入，减产社能弥补全部或部分损失，受灾严重的社能够生产自救。会后各地都采取措施帮助农民发展经济作物和副业生产。现在，各地农业社都修订了农副业生产计划，并且统一安排劳力，留出一定劳动时间让社员经营家庭副业。
    为了加强领导，中共湖南省各地委、县委都设立副业生产办公室，各乡和农业社也指定专人负责。财经部门根据具体情况提高了一些土特产品的收购价格，初步改变了过去收购中的压级压价现象。许多县还召开经济结合会议，使有关部门同农业社订立产、供、销结合合同，具体指导生产，以避免盲目发展副业的现象产生。
    “田里取金，山上掏宝，溪里捞银”
    浙江省农民因地制宜发展副业
    新华社杭州16日电　“田里取金，山上掏宝，溪里捞银。”这是富阳县大青乡农民在开展多种经营中提出的口号。像大青乡一样的多样性的生产运动，在浙江省内半数以上的合作社中已经蓬勃地展开起来了。
    目前浙江省平原地区扩种蔬菜、发展饲养业，山区挖药材、烧柴炭砖瓦，沿海地区捕鱼捞虾，以及各地的手工业和副业等生产的恢复和发展都比较快。杭县自开展多样性的生产后，全县已增养鸭子十万多只，扩种蔬菜三万多亩。临安县农民从9月份以来，因开展多种经营而使收入增加了三十多万元。建德专区69％的高级社，都从多样性生产中得到了新的收入。上虞县城关区一百四十五个社，在开展多种经营以前，只有八十四个社能保证90％社员增加收入，现在能达到这个标准的已增加到一百零三个社，其它的社也可以达到80％社员增加收入。
    浙江省是山多田少耕地不足的地区，平均每一个农业人口只有一点七亩土地。这个地区广有资源，生产内容丰富，农民向来就有进行多样生产的传统。
    瑞金县山区农业社社员采集山苍籽等工业原料
    新华社南昌16日电　革命老根据地瑞金县山区农业社组织女社员采集了大批山苍籽、九层皮、梧桐皮等工业原料。据瑞金县供销合作社统计，最近一个多月以来，已收购山苍籽、九层皮、梧桐皮等共六万五千多斤，农民此项收入达九千多元。
    山苍籽可以蒸煮成山苍籽油，是制新药香水、香皂、汽水的原料油。上海化工原料公司派驻瑞金县的采购人员说，在瑞金山区找到的山苍籽，经过化验，内含有多量的柠檬，质量很好。九层皮和梧桐皮是造纸原料。
    高桥农业社检查多种经营情况克服了干部的自满情绪
    新华社桂林16日电　广西省鹿寨县高桥农业生产合作社，最近检查多种经营发展计划的执行情况，克服了干部的自满情绪，使副业生产更加活跃起来。
    这个社的多种经营有三十二项，计划秋冬两季生产总值达到七万一千五百多元。计划执行以来，多种经营已经取得了一些成绩，在这种情况下，社干部便认为社员的油盐小菜零用钱，全由社里包下来也没有问题了。但是实际上，由于缺乏经验和管理不当，有些项目如计划种植的萝卜、大蒜等，就因误了季节或因受旱，要比原计划减少收入六千九百多元。社员担心生产总值计划能不能兑现。
    最近，这个社的干部在社员的提议下，逐项检查了生产计划的执行情况，结果发现多种经营计划中有八项已经不能完成，这才克服了他们的自满情绪。根据这种情况，社管理委员会重新进行研究，决定充分利用有利条件，要求十二项能够超额完成计划的生产，争取进一步扩大，如在水塘中养鱼一项，只要增加几个管理人员，多放青草饲料，鱼儿长得肥大一些，就可比原计划增产五千斤，多收一千七百多元。加上新开辟的生产门路，全社副业生产总值预期完全可以切实兑现。
    这些积极措施很快就被社员们接受了。现在，各项副业生产比以前更加活跃。
    福建山区开始秋季狩猎
    新华社福州16日电　福建山区已到稻穗黄熟、甘薯结块的时候，野兽为害庄稼更加猖獗。各地猎手开始秋季狩猎，大显身手。
    福建西部和北部的三十个县，已组织起二千四百多个狩猎队。他们最近一个多月来的战绩是：打死虎、豹、山猪、刺猥、山麂、山羊等野兽三千五百多头，还消灭了大批田鼠。
    今年各地建立打猎队的数量较去年增加了许多。他们除了挖陷兽坑、设吊绳、安装路枪、制捕兽笼、做“糖衣炮弹”（把兽炮包在食饵里）等办法来捕杀野兽外，还经常上山剿兽。野兽经常出没的地区，乡与乡之间还建立了联防，一发现兽迹，就涉水越岭，跟踪追击。
    打猎队不但保护了人畜和庄稼，而且出售猎获物也使他们增加了一笔可观的收入。
