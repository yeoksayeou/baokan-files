    Eliminating Drought in the Central Gansu Arid Region

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: In the central Gansu arid region, among the 550+ villages that frequently suffer from drought, 103 villages now have an average of more than one mu of paddy field per person. The yield per mu of paddy field is more than 100 jin higher than that of dry land, and many grain-deficient areas have now become grain-surplus areas.

    Currently, there are more than 2.2 million mu of irrigated land in the central Gansu arid region. Most of these irrigated lands have been developed in the past three or four years. Among them, Dingxi Prefecture, the most arid region, now has double the area of paddy fields compared to 1952.

    The central Gansu arid region includes 27 counties and cities such as Gaolan and Yuzhong, covering an area of more than 127,000 square kilometers. Vegetation is sparse and rainfall is scarce. According to historical records spanning more than 260 years, a drought occurs on average every two years. Before liberation, during each drought, tens of thousands to more than one hundred thousand people fled in search of food.

    甘肃中部干旱地区消除干旱
    据新华社讯　甘肃省中部干旱地区五百五十多个经常遭受干旱的乡中，已有一百零三个乡平均每人已有一亩以上的水田。每亩水田比旱地增产一百斤以上，许多缺粮地区现在已变为余粮地区。
    现在，中部干旱地区已有二百二十多万亩水地。这些水地大部分是近三、四年来发展的。其中最干旱的定西专区，现有水田面积比1952年增加了两倍。
    甘肃省中部干旱地区包括皋兰、榆中等二十七个县、市，面积十二万七千多平方公里。这里草木稀少，雨量缺乏，据二百六十多年的历史记载，平均每两年就发生一次旱灾，解放前每逢旱灾，都有数万以至十多万人逃荒。
