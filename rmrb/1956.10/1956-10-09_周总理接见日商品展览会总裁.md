Xinhua News Agency, 8th — Premier Zhou Enlai told Mr. Shozo Murata, President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and President of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition, today that only on the basis of peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between China and Japan can the development of trade and the strengthening of various ties achieve genuine co-existence and co-prosperity.

This afternoon, before visiting the Japanese Commodity Exhibition, Premier Zhou Enlai had an hour-long conversation with Shozo Murata and Eiichi Shukutani, head of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition Group.

When discussing the prospects of trade between China and Japan, Premier Zhou Enlai believed that China and Japan have very good conditions for developing trade. He also expressed his belief that if the artificial obstacles from the Japanese side could be eliminated, trade between China and Japan would definitely develop greatly.

Premier Zhou Enlai believed that holding commodity exhibitions in each other's countries is a good way to develop friendly relations between the two countries. He also pointed out that the efforts made by the Japanese business community and people from all walks of life in holding this Japanese commodity exhibition are very meaningful.

Premier Zhou Enlai also said that China needs to learn science and technology from all technologically advanced countries. Japanese technology is more advanced than China's, and we are neighbors, which will make learning more convenient.

When Murata said that Asian countries have united and some people in Japan are beginning to feel isolated, Premier Zhou Enlai said that China wants to unite with all Asian countries such as Japan, India, Indonesia, and Burma and coexist peacefully. He also pointed out that this unity must be the unity of all Asian countries, not a unity centered on one country. Premier Zhou Enlai also said that the Bandung Conference is a concrete example of this kind of unity.

    周恩来总理今天下午在参观日本商品展览会前同村田省藏和日本商品展览团团长宿谷荣一，作了一小时的交谈。

    周恩来总理认为，两国相互举办商品展览会是发展两国友好关系的一种很好的办法。他并且指出，日本工商界和各界人士在举办这次日本商品展览会中所作的努力是很有意义的。
    周恩来总理还说，中国需要向一切技术先进的国家学习科学技术，日本技术比中国先进，我们又是近邻，学习起来将更方便。
    在村田谈到亚洲国家已经团结起来而日本有些人开始感到孤立时，周恩来总理说，中国要和日本、印度、印度尼西亚和缅甸等一切亚洲国家团结起来，和平共处。他并且指出，这种团结必须是整个亚洲国家的团结，而不是以一个国家为中心的团结。周恩来总理还说万隆会议就是这种团结的一个具体榜样。
