The Stone Gate Cave Ancient Site is Unprotected
To the Editor:

　　Stone Gate Cave is located in Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province. The scenery here is beautiful, and the mountains are majestic, making it one of the famous scenic spots in southern Zhejiang. It is said to be the place where Liu Bowen, posthumously known as Duke Wencheng of the Ming Dynasty, studied.

　　The Stone Gate Cave is naturally formed, with the Dragon Ridge on the right and the Tiger Ridge on the left. The two peaks stand facing each other, and the stone walls are dozens of feet high, hence the name Stone Gate. At the entrance of the cave is the Wenjin Pavilion. Walking along the stream for dozens of steps, one is surrounded by towering mountains, lush forests and bamboo, flying waterfalls and clear springs, with the Lingyou Temple standing in the center.

　　Such a good place, however, has suffered from neglect of protection. The pavilions, terraces, buildings, and towers in the cave are mostly dilapidated, and the ancient forests have also been largely felled and damaged. Except for a lush patch of forest on the cliff to the left of the Liugong Temple Guenputing, there are very few large trees that are over a century old. In particular, last year, after the Zhejiang Forest Engineering Bureau called for the large-scale purchase of camphor trees, nearby residents cut down more than a dozen large camphor trees that were three or four hundred years old inside the cave. These trees all grew in key scenic spots and on cliffs inside the cave. After the felling, the scenery suffered extremely serious damage. It is impossible to replant such large trees. If this is not stopped quickly, the remaining forests of Stone Gate Cave will be completely destroyed.

　　A monk named Chen in the temple has repeatedly applied to the Qingtian County government for increased protection, but no action has been taken. This kind of disregard for the country's precious scenic spots and ancient trees is intolerable. In addition to suggesting that the local government pay attention and take effective measures quickly, we hope that relevant departments will learn from this painful lesson and pay close attention to the protection of scenic spots and scenic forest trees everywhere.

Fossils Excavated from Yushan Were Damaged
To the Editor:

　　When the Changshu City Yushan Quarrying Company in Jiangsu Province was quarrying at Yushan, it successively excavated many fossils of ancient creatures and human weapons from the rocks. Because they were not properly preserved, these fossils were damaged. Some of the remaining parts are already incomplete. For example, the turtle fossil among them originally had a head and feet, but now only the body remains. Only a quarter of a soft-shelled turtle remains. A fossil of a swimming crab also only has a round body left, and the feet and claws are missing. A fossil that was more than two feet long and looked like an ancient sword was cut into several pieces. These fossils are of great value for studying geological formation and the lives of ancient humans. It is recommended that relevant departments strengthen the education of quarrying workers on the protection of cultural relics; cultural relic management departments should collect and preserve these cultural relics in a timely manner.

    应当重视文物保护工作
    石门洞古迹无人保护编辑同志：
    石门洞在浙江省青田县境。这里风景优美，山势雄伟，为浙南名胜之一。相传是明初刘文成公刘伯温读书的地方。
    石门洞形势天成，右为龙岭，左称虎岭，两峰对峙，石壁高数十丈，故称石门。洞口有问津亭，沿小溪前行数十步，四壁崇山环绕，茂林修竹，飞瀑清泉，灵佑寺矗立中央。
    这样一个好地方，却由于忽视保护，洞里亭、台、楼、阁大都倾圮，古木老林也大都被盗伐破坏。除刘公祠观瀑亭左测的悬岩上还有一片葱郁的林木外，百年以上的大树已经很少了。特别是去年浙江森林工程局号召大量收购樟树后，附近居民又在洞内砍去三、四百年生的大香樟十数株。这些树都生长在洞内风景要害和悬岩陡壁的地方。砍伐以后，使风景遭到了极其严重的破坏。再度培植如此大树已不可能。如不赶快制止，石门洞的残存林木势将全部破坏净尽。
    寺内一个姓陈的修士曾数次向青田县政府申请加意保护，未见下文。这种漠视祖国宝贵名胜古迹和古老林木的行为是不能令人容忍的。除建议当地政府引起注意，迅速采取有效措施外，希望有关部门吸取这一惨痛教训，切实注意各地名胜古迹和风景林木的保护。

    从虞山掘出的化石被损毁了编辑同志：
    江苏省常熟市虞山采石公司在虞山采石时，曾先后从岩石中发掘出不少古代生物和人类武器的化石，因为没有妥善保存，这些化石都被破损了。现在留存的一部分，已经残缺不全。如其中的乌龟化石，原来有头有脚，现在只剩下一个身子。一只甲鱼，只剩了四分之一。一只爬蟹化石也只剩下一块圆体，脚、螯均散失了。一根二尺多长的很像古代宝剑的化石，被截成数断。这些化石对研究地质形成和古代人类生活情况是有很大价值的。建议有关部门对采石工作人员加强保护文物的教育；文物保管部门应该把这些文物及时收集保管起来。
