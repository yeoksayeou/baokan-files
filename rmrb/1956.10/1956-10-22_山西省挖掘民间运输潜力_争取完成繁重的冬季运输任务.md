Xinhua News Agency Report: Shanxi Province held a transportation conference from October 7th to 15th, focusing on the issue of tapping into the potential of private transportation. The conference decided to organize 5,500 private rubber-wheeled carts and more than 36,000 steel-wheeled vehicles to participate in transportation, in order to alleviate the current transportation bottlenecks and strive to complete the heavy transportation tasks for the fourth quarter.

The conference predicted that after mobilizing this enormous transportation force, it would not only guarantee the completion of this year's transportation tasks, but also transport some of the materials originally scheduled for transportation next year in advance.

In order to ensure the gradual expansion and consolidation of private transportation forces, the conference adjusted some unreasonable restrictions on private transportation; regarding the treatment of transportation workers, it was also decided to adopt the method of signing contracts with agricultural production cooperatives, so that people participating in transportation could receive reasonable remuneration.

In accordance with the principle of "overall planning, division of labor and responsibility," the conference also comprehensively arranged the tasks of various regions and various modes of transportation, deciding that the motor vehicles of state-owned transportation units would be responsible for transportation on the main transportation lines above the county level, and that private horse-drawn carts, in addition to supporting state-owned vehicles, would mainly be responsible for transportation from counties and townships to transportation trunk lines.

    山西省挖掘民间运输潜力
    争取完成繁重的冬季运输任务
    新华社讯　山西省在10月7日到15日举行交通运输会议，着重研究了挖掘民间运输潜力的问题。会议决定组织民间胶轮马车五千五百辆，钢轮车三万六千多辆参加运输，以解除当前运输堵塞的情况，争取完成第四季度繁重的运输任务。
    会议预计，这支巨大的运输力量调动起来以后，不但能够保证完成今年的运输任务，而且还可以提前运输一部分原定明年运输的物资。
    为了保证逐步扩展和巩固民间运输力量，会议对当前民间运输方面的一些不合理限制作了调整；对于运输车工的待遇问题，也决定采取与农业生产合作社订立合同的办法，使参加运输的人能得到合理的报酬。
    根据“统筹安排，分工负责”的方针，会议还全面安排了当前各地区和各种运输工具的任务，决定国营运输单位的汽车负责县城以上的主要运输干线上的运输，民间马车除支援国营车辆外，主要担负从县、乡到交通干线之间的运输。
