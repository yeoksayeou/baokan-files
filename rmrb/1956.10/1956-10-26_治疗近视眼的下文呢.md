    Follow-up on the Treatment of Myopia
    A few months ago, we saw reports in the newspaper that some hospitals in Beijing were basically able to cure myopia, but there were still some problems in the treatment, and experiments were continuing. We, as myopia sufferers, are very eagerly awaiting the results of the experiments, but until now, we have not seen the newspaper continue to report on this.

    治疗近视眼的下文呢
    几个月以前，我们在报纸上看到报道北京某些医院，已经能够基本上治好近视眼，但治疗中还有一些问题，正继续进行试验。我们这些近视患者非常迫切地等待着试验的结果，但是直到现在，还没有看到报纸继续报道。
