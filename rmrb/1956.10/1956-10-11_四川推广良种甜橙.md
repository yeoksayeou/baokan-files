Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 4th. Sichuan Province's agricultural departments are promoting the Jiangjin goose egg-shaped sweet orange (improved variety) saplings and are preparing to use grafting methods to maintain the excellent quality of the sweet oranges.

In the fourth quarter of this year, more than 93,000 Jiangjin goose egg-shaped sweet orange saplings will be transported from Jiangjin to Leshan, Wanxian, Fuling, Luzhou, and other five special districts, as well as rural areas in the suburbs of Chongqing. These saplings will be used as scions (branches for grafting) in the future for local grafting and propagation. Local state-owned farms and agricultural cooperatives in sweet orange producing areas sowed a large number of sweet orange seeds last winter to cultivate seedlings. These seedlings have now grown to more than a foot tall and can be used as rootstocks next year.

Sichuan Province is a famous sweet orange producing area. Because farmers in various places have used seedling propagation for a long time, some sweet orange varieties have gradually mutated and cannot maintain their original excellent quality. After liberation, the agricultural department of Sichuan Province specially established experimental institutions in the improved sweet orange producing areas and switched to using grafting methods to propagate improved varieties, with very good results.

    四川推广良种甜橙
    新华社成都4日电　四川省农业部门正在推广江津鹅蛋形甜橙（良种）树苗，并且准备用嫁接方法使甜橙保持优良的品质。
    今年第四季度内，将有九万三千多株江津鹅蛋形甜橙树苗，从江津运往乐山、万县、涪陵、泸州等五个专区和重庆市郊区农村栽植。这些树苗在今后将作为接穗（嫁接用的枝），在当地嫁接繁殖。甜橙产区各县的地方国营农场和农业社在去冬播种了大量甜橙种籽，培育幼苗。现在这些幼苗已长到一尺多高，明年就可以作为砧木（被接的干）。
    四川省是著名的甜橙产地。由于各地农民许久以来多用实生繁殖，有些甜橙品种逐渐发生变异，不能保持原来的优良品质。解放后，四川省农业部门特在良种甜橙产区设立试验机构，改用嫁接方法繁殖良种，效果很好。
