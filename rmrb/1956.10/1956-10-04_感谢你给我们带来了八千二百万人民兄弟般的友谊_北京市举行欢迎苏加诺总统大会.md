Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. President Sukarno, at a welcome rally of over 30,000 people in Beijing this afternoon, shouted "Merdeka" (Independence) five times with all those welcoming him. He said that Egypt's victory in the Suez Canal issue was also a victory for the people of Asia and a victory for the world's people in their struggle against colonialism. Colonialism must die, imperialism must die, and no one can save it.

President Sukarno said at the rally held to welcome him that the friendship between China and Indonesia in struggle is solid. When our ideals are fully realized and the struggle is successful, the friendship between the two countries will be even more consolidated. Our struggle is not yet complete. You are fighting for the recovery of Taiwan, and we are fighting for the recovery of West Irian. Forward, you continue to move forward, continue to struggle. We also continue to move forward, continue to struggle. At this time, the audience applauded enthusiastically and cheered: "Long live Chinese-Indonesian friendship!"

President Sukarno then said that the victory of China's struggle and the victory of Indonesia's struggle are the victories of all Asia. Egypt's victory on the Suez Canal is also a victory for Asia and a victory for the world's anti-colonialist struggle.

President Sukarno, after mentioning the fact that Indonesia recognized the People's Republic of China in 1950, said that there are still some countries that dare not face reality and do not recognize the People's Republic of China supported by 600 million people; however, after a while, the whole world will recognize the People's Republic of China. He said that this is the law of natural development, and no one can violate this law.

In the middle of President Sukarno's speech, Premier Zhou Enlai shouted "Bung Karno" (Brother Karno) to the audience. The venue immediately became jubilant, and the cheers of "Bung Karno" rose one after another.

President Sukarno's speech was interrupted again and again by cheers and thunderous applause. People welcoming him repeatedly shouted: "Merdeka," "Long live peace," "Long live President Sukarno," "Sukarno, Mao Zedong." President Sukarno also said "Thank you" in Chinese to the enthusiastic welcomers several times.

The welcome rally was presided over by Mayor Peng Zhen. On behalf of the people of Beijing, he expressed a warm welcome and heartfelt respect to the distinguished guests for their friendly visit. He said that President Sukarno's name is linked to the heroic anti-colonialist struggle of the Indonesian people and to the Asian-African Conference with great historical significance. The Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the Indonesian people against colonialism. The Chinese people have the greatest respect for President Sukarno's outstanding contributions to winning and maintaining Indonesia's independence and to winning and maintaining world peace.

Peng Zhen said: We must continue to firmly support the just struggle of the Egyptian people, continue to fight to safeguard our respective sovereignty and territorial integrity, so that colonialism cannot find a foothold on this earth. We Chinese people and Indonesian people are shoulder-to-shoulder comrades-in-arms in the anti-colonialist struggle, and this struggle has closely linked the people of China and Indonesia. He said: "Let us support each other more closely in the struggle against colonialism and for peace, and in our respective construction undertakings, and continue to develop and consolidate the friendship between our two countries."

The welcome rally was held at the Xian Nong Tan Stadium. Countless colorful flags fluttered in the wind around the stadium. On a huge horizontal banner in the center of the archway at the main entrance, "Salute to President Sukarno" was written in Chinese and Indonesian. A portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong and President Sukarno hung in the center of the rostrum. The national flags of China and Indonesia hung on both sides of the portrait. Palm trees and chrysanthemums were placed in front of the stage. In front of the rostrum were three huge slogans: "Long Live Asian-African and World Peace," "Welcome Distinguished Guests from the Great Neighboring Country of Indonesia," and "Long Live the Unbreakable Friendship Between the Chinese and Indonesian People." The venue was filled with celebrities, politicians, famous peace activists, cultural and religious figures, government workers, and citizens from all walks of life in Beijing. They were all dressed in festive costumes to welcome the outstanding leader of the great neighboring country.

President Sukarno and the senior officials who accompanied him on his visit to China, accompanied by Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Mayor Peng Zhen, ascended the rostrum at 2:10 pm. The band played a beautiful and melodious welcome tune, and the audience stood up, with applause like a storm lasting for five minutes. A group of female students went on stage to present flowers to the distinguished guests. Applause, cheers, and music intertwined into one. President Sukarno applauded and saluted the audience on the stage.

    感谢你给我们带来了八千二百万人民兄弟般的友谊
    北京市举行欢迎苏加诺总统大会
    苏加诺总统在大会上说：殖民主义一定要死亡，帝国主义一定要死亡
    新华社3日讯　苏加诺总统今天下午在北京市三万多人的欢迎大会上，同全体欢迎者一起振臂五次高呼：“默地加”（独立）。他说：埃及在苏伊士运河问题上的胜利，也是亚洲人民的胜利，是全世界人民反殖民主义斗争的胜利。殖民主义一定要死亡，帝国主义一定要死亡，任何人也不能挽救它。
    苏加诺总统在这个为欢迎他而举行的大会上说：中国和印度尼西亚在斗争中的友谊是巩固的。等到我们理想完全实现了，斗争成功了，两国的友谊就更加巩固。现在我们的斗争还未完成。你们在为收复台湾而斗争，我们在为收复西伊里安而斗争。前进吧，你们继续前进，继续斗争。我们也继续前进，继续斗争。这时，全场热烈鼓掌，欢呼：“中国印度尼西亚友好万岁！”
    苏加诺总统接着又说，中国斗争的胜利，印度尼西亚斗争的胜利，就是全亚洲的胜利。埃及在苏伊士运河上的胜利，也是亚洲的胜利和全世界反殖民主义斗争的胜利。
    苏加诺总统在谈到印度尼西亚在1950年就承认了中华人民共和国的事实后，他说，现在还有一些国家不敢正视现实，不承认有六亿人民支持的中华人民共和国；但是，过一个时候，全世界都要承认中华人民共和国的。他说，这是自然发展的法则，没有任何人能违反这个法则。
    在苏加诺总统讲话的中间，周恩来总理向全场高呼“朋加诺”（加诺兄）。会场立即欢腾起来，“朋加诺”的欢呼声，此起彼落。
    苏加诺总统的讲话一次又一次地被欢呼和雷动般的掌声所打断。欢迎的人们不断高呼：“默地加”、“和平万岁”、“苏加诺总统万岁”、“苏加诺、毛泽东”。苏加诺总统也几次用中国话对热情的欢迎者们说：“谢谢”。
    欢迎大会由彭真市长主持。他代表北京市人民对贵宾们的友好访问表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意。他说：苏加诺总统的名字是同英勇的印度尼西亚人民反殖民主义的斗争联系在一起的，是同具有伟大历史意义的亚非会议联系在一起的。中国人民坚决支持印度尼西亚人民反对殖民主义的正义斗争。中国人民对于苏加诺总统为争取和维护印度尼西亚的独立和为争取和维护世界和平所作的卓越贡献怀有最大的敬意。
    彭真说：我们必须继续坚决支持埃及人民的正义斗争、继续为维护我们各自的主权和领土完整而斗争，使殖民主义在这个地球上找不到一块立足的地方。我们中国人民同印度尼西亚人民是反殖民主义斗争中的肩并肩的战友，这种斗争已经把中国和印度尼西亚两国人民紧密地连结在一起。他说：“让我们在反对殖民主义和争取和平的斗争中，在各自的建设事业中更加亲密的互相支持并且继续发展和巩固我们两国的友谊。”
    欢迎大会在先农坛体育场举行。无数面彩旗在体育场四周迎风飘扬，在正门牌楼正中的一幅巨大横标上，用中国和印度尼西亚文写着“向苏加诺总统致敬”。主席台正面挂着毛泽东主席和苏加诺总统的画像。画像两旁挂着中国和印度尼西亚两国国旗。台前摆着棕树和菊花。在主席台正面是三条巨大的标语：“亚非和世界和平万岁”、“欢迎来自伟大的邻邦印度尼西亚的贵宾”、“中国和印度尼西亚人民的牢不可破的友谊万岁”。会场的四周坐满了北京市各界社会名流、政治家、著名的和平人士、文化界和宗教界人士、机关工作者和市民。他们都穿着节日的盛装，来这里欢迎伟大邻邦的杰出领袖。
    苏加诺总统和随他同来中国访问的高级官员们，由朱德副主席、周恩来总理和彭真市长陪同，在下午二时十分登上主席台。乐队奏起了优美悦耳的欢迎曲，全场起立，狂风暴雨般的掌声持续五分钟之久。一群女学生上台向贵宾们献了鲜花。掌声、欢呼声、乐曲声交织成一片。苏加诺总统在台上向全场欢迎的人们鼓掌致意。
    随同苏加诺总统一起登上主席台的，还有正在中国访问的印度尼西亚共和国国会代表团负责人和印度尼西亚其他人士，印度尼西亚驻中国大使维约普拉诺托。
    同贵宾们一起在主席台上的，还有李济深副委员长，贺龙、陈毅副总理，外交部副部长张闻天、姬鹏飞，中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇，中国印度尼西亚友好协会会长鲍尔汉，中国人民政治协商会议北京市委员会主席刘仁，北京市副市长张友渔、吴晗、王昆仑、薛子正、冯基平、程宏毅、贾庭三、乐松生，各民主党派北京市组织负责人，北京市各人民团体负责人和中国人民解放军驻京部队负责人。
    欢迎大会开始，乐队奏印度尼西亚、中国两国国歌。
    彭真市长在会上讲话。在乐曲声中，他代表北京市人民向苏加诺总统赠送锦旗和礼品。在锦旗上写着：“我们热烈地欢迎你——中国人民的朋友前来我国访问，我们感谢你给我们带来了八千二百万印度尼西亚人民兄弟般的友谊。我们坚决支持印度尼西亚人民为维护民族独立，为肃清殖民主义残余势力和保卫世界和平而进行的英勇斗争。”
    苏加诺总统接着讲话，受到了全场热烈的欢迎。
    在欢迎大会后，贵宾们还观看了精采紧张的足球表演赛。表演毕，苏加诺总统同运动员们握手见面，人们从四面八方拥向苏加诺总统，向他热烈欢呼。在一片掌声中，贵宾们离开了会场。
