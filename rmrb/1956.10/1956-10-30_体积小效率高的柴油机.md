Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th. The Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory has recently produced a high-speed diesel engine with a very small volume and extremely economical use of materials.

This 300-horsepower diesel engine weighs only a little over 1,300 kilograms. This is about the same weight as the 60-horsepower diesel engine currently being produced by the factory. Because the weight of the machine has been reduced, manufacturing such a 300-horsepower diesel engine can save five to six thousand kilograms of steel compared to manufacturing an ordinary diesel engine of the same horsepower. Because of its small size and light weight, this diesel engine is most suitable for ships, vehicles, and construction sites and mines.

This diesel engine was successfully trial-produced with reference to Soviet blueprints and with the assistance of other fraternal factories. Recently, after high-speed, low-speed, and overload tests, its performance was completely in accordance with the blueprint requirements, and its fuel consumption did not exceed the specified standards.

    体积小效率高的柴油机
    新华社上海28日电　上海柴油机厂最近制成了一台体积很小、用料极省的高速柴油机。
    这台三百匹马力的柴油机，体重只有一千三百多公斤。这和这个工厂目前正在生产的六十匹马力柴油机的体重差不多。因为减轻了机器体重，制造这样一台三百匹马力的柴油机，比制造一台同样马力的普通柴油机，可以节省五、六千公斤钢铁。因为体积小体重轻，这种柴油机最适合于船舶、车辆以及工地、矿山之用。
    这台柴油机是参考苏联图纸和在其他兄弟厂协助下试制成功的，最近经过快车、慢车以及超荷负试车，性能完全与图纸要求一样，耗油量也不超过规定的标准。
