    A Factual Error in an Article
    Comrade Deng Ke's letter: In Comrade Bao Chang's article "'Family Law' and 'National Learning'" on the eighth page of the People's Daily on August 31, a few sentences are incorrect. The article stated: "During the reign of Emperor Ping of Han, the Mao Commentary on the Book of Songs with Zheng Xuan's Annotations was exclusively established as 'National Learning'..." As everyone knows, Emperor Ping of Han lived during the late Western Han Dynasty. Zheng Xuan's Annotations on the Mao Commentary on the Book of Songs were written by Zheng Xuan, who lived during the late Eastern Han Dynasty. How could the Mao Commentary on the Book of Songs with Zheng Xuan's Annotations be established as "National Learning" during the reign of Emperor Ping of Han? Isn't this a joke? Furthermore, the article first quoted the "Biography of Confucian Scholars" from the "Book of Later Han," stating that during the reign of Emperor Guangwu of Han, there were four schools of poetry: Qi, Lu, Han, and Mao. Then it said that during the reign of Emperor Ping of Han, the Mao Commentary on the Book of Songs with Zheng Xuan's Annotations was established as "National Learning," and since then, other schools of poetry were no longer transmitted. This probably mistakenly placed Emperor Ping of Han after Emperor Guangwu of the Eastern Han Dynasty. I believe such errors should not occur.
    Comrade Bao Chang's reply: The statement that the Mao Commentary on the Book of Songs with Zheng Xuan's Annotations was established as "National Learning" during the reign of Emperor Ping of Han was mainly based on my reference to the "Classic Interpretations." However, I did not carefully study it when quoting, which led to the problem. Comrade Deng Ke's suggestion is very good, and I would like to express my gratitude to him.
        Strive to Achieve a Combination of Pictures and Texts
    Since the revision of the People's Daily, more attention has been paid to the combination of pictures and texts. For example, the serial article "What I Saw in America" written by Xie Jialin on the sixth page of September 7th and 8th, with several illustrations by Miao Di, not only enlivened the page but also deepened the readers' impression. However, sometimes the newspaper neglects this point. For example, the dispatch "The Most Popular Performance in Santiago" published on the fifth page of September 7th introduced the warm welcome received by the Chinese Folk Art Troupe during their performance in Santiago, Chile. It would have been good to publish some photos at the same time, but there were none. On the other hand, two photos reflecting the activities of the Chinese Folk Art Troupe in Santiago were published alone on September 4th and 8th. This kind of separation of pictures and texts weakens the effect of publicity.　Zeng Kang
      Hoping for More News Maps
    The People's Daily publishes too few news maps. For example, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, which recently opened to traffic to Yumen and is being extended further, and the Neijiang-Kunming Railway, which recently started construction, pass through which places? If maps were attached to them, it would be very good. It can deepen readers' understanding of the news, increase readers' geographical knowledge, and also make the page more lively.　Li Huimin
      Write About Us Young Students!
    I am a student at Peking University. I love literature and art very much, especially reading literary works about us young students. I have read books such as "The Story of Zoya and Shura," "Gulya's Path," "First-Year University Student," "Three People in Gray Overcoats," etc.; the heroic characters in the books have deeply attracted me. But these are all Soviet literary works. In our newspapers and periodicals, there are very few literary works depicting our Chinese young students and university students, and such works cannot be found in bookstores either. In fact, life in school today is not dull, and there are contradictions and struggles, and there is a lot to write about. I hope that writers who are familiar with school life will pick up their pens and write about us! I also hope that students with certain writing abilities will also write about our own lives!　Wang Yonghou
        What Does "Bali" Mean?
    Some readers have written to inquire: What does "Bali" in the Indonesian Bali Art Troupe, which has been invited to visit our country, mean? "峇" is pronounced "bā." Bali is a beautiful island in eastern Java. Balinese people love art very much, and Bali's music, dance, and sculpture are world-famous.　——Editor

    一篇文章中的史实错误
    邓珂同志的来信：8月31日人民日报第八版鲍昌同志所写的“‘家法’与‘国学’”一文，有几句话弄错了。文中说：“汉平帝时，独把毛诗郑笺立为‘国学’……”。大家都知道，汉平帝是西汉（前汉）末年时候的人。郑笺是郑玄的毛诗笺，郑玄是东汉（后汉）末年时候的人。在汉平帝时，怎么能够把毛诗郑笺立为“国学”，这不是一个笑话吗？又文中先引“后汉书”的“儒林传”说，汉光武时诗有齐、鲁、韩、毛四家。后又说汉平帝时立毛诗郑笺为“国学”，自此以后别家的诗也就不传了。这大概又把汉平帝误认为在东汉（后汉）光武之后了。这种错误我认为是不应该有的。
    鲍昌同志的复信：毛诗郑笺在汉平帝时立为国学一说，我主要是参考“经典释文”而写的。但在引用时没有认真研究，以致发生问题。邓珂同志的意见很好，我愿向他表示谢意。
        尽力做到图文并茂
    人民日报改版以来比较重视图文并茂。例如9月7日、8日第六版连载的谢家麟写的“我所见到的美国”，有苗地的几幅插画，不仅使版面活泼，而且加深了读者的印象。但是有时候报纸对这一点却忽视了。像9月7日第五版刊登的通讯
  “圣地亚哥最得人心的演出”，内容是介绍中国民间艺术团在圣地亚哥演出时受到智利人民热烈欢迎的情况，如果同时发表一些照片就好了，但是没有。在9月4日和8日的报纸上却又孤零零地发表了两张反映我国民间艺术团在圣地亚哥活动的照片。这种图文割裂的做法，就削弱了宣传的效果。　曾　康
      希望多登些新闻地图
    人民日报发表的新闻地图还嫌少些。如最近通车到玉门并陆续向前修筑的兰新铁路和最近动工修建的内昆铁路等，经过哪些地方，假若都附有地图，就很好了。它能够加深读者对新闻的了解，也可以增加读者的地理知识，并且还能使版面活泼。　李惠民
      写写我们青年学生吧！
    我是北京大学的学生。我很喜爱文艺，特别喜爱阅读有关我们青年学生的文艺作品。我读过“卓娅和舒拉的故事”、“古丽雅的道路”“一年级大学生”、“三个穿灰大衣的人”等书；书中的英雄人物曾深深地吸引了我。但这些都是苏联的文学作品。在我们的报刊上却很少看到描写我们中国青年学生和大学生的文艺作品，在书店里也找不到这类作品。其实，今天学校里的生活并不平淡，并不是没有矛盾和斗争，可写的东西很多。希望对学校生活比较熟悉的作家们，拿起笔来写写我们吧！也希望有一定写作能力的同学们，也来写写我们自己的生活吧！　王永厚
        “峇厘”作何解释
    有些读者来信询问：应邀来我国访问的印度尼西亚峇厘艺术团的
  “峇厘”作何解释。“峇”音巴。峇厘是爪哇东部一个美丽的岛屿。峇厘人非常喜爱艺术，峇厘的音乐、舞蹈和雕刻在世界上都很有名。　——编者
