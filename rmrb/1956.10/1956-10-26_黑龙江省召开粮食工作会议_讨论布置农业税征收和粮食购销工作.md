Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, October 23rd: Heilongjiang Province recently held a grain work conference with the participation of secretaries of prefectural and county committees, to discuss and arrange this year's agricultural tax collection and unified grain purchase and sale work.

The meeting believed that although some areas of Heilongjiang Province suffered from floods this year, crops in non-disaster areas generally grew well. After the upsurge of rural socialism, farmers' political awareness has greatly improved, especially after the implementation of the "three fix" policy for grain last winter. These are all favorable conditions for doing a good job in grain purchase this year. The meeting unanimously agreed that it is appropriate for Heilongjiang Province's grain purchase task to increase by 6% compared to last year. However, since 700,000 hectares of farmland in the province have been affected by floods, the grain purchase task in these areas must be reduced or exempted. Increased purchases must also be made in high-yield areas according to the state-stipulated increase ratio, that is, the increased purchase portion should not exceed 40% of the increased production. Therefore, the meeting particularly emphasized that everything should be done in accordance with the provisions of the "three fix" policy, requiring that under the principle of implementing the policy, the state's grain purchase task should be completed, and the needs of the agricultural cooperatives for public grain and the individual needs of the members should be guaranteed. At the beginning of grain purchase, each agricultural cooperative should have cadres from the county and township to provide specific guidance. The meeting also formulated detailed methods for agricultural tax collection and reduction.

The meeting also believed that while carrying out unified grain purchase, it is necessary to strengthen unified grain sales in urban and rural areas, and immediately stop the current abnormal phenomenon of grain sales.

    黑龙江省召开粮食工作会议
    讨论布置农业税征收和粮食购销工作
    新华社哈尔滨23日电　黑龙江省最近召开了有地委和县委书记参加的粮食工作会议，讨论和布置了今年的农业税征收工作和粮食统购统销工作。
    会议认为，今年黑龙江省虽有部分地区受到了水灾，但是非灾区的农作物普遍生长良好。农村社会主义高潮以后，农民政治觉悟大大提高。特别是去冬实行了粮食三定政策。这些都是今年作好粮食征购工作的有利条件。会议一致认为，黑龙江省今年的征购粮任务比去年增加6％是适宜的。但是由于全省有七十万公顷农田遭受水灾，这些地区的征购粮任务必须减免，对丰产地区也必须按国家规定的增购比例去增购，即增购部分不超过增产部分的40％。因此，会上特别强调一切按“三定”政策规定办事，要求在贯彻执行政策的原则下，既要完成国家征购任务，又要保证农业社公用粮和社员个人的粮食需要。在购粮开始，要求每个农业社都要有县、乡的干部做具体指导工作。会上还制定详细的农业税征收、减免办法。
    会议并且认为，在粮食统购的同时，必须加强城乡粮食统销工作，立即制止目前粮食销售的不正常现象。
