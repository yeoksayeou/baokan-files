The six principles on the Suez Canal issue adopted by the United Nations Security Council have laid the foundation for resolving this issue through peaceful negotiations. Fair-minded world opinion hopes that the countries concerned will negotiate on this basis so that the Suez Canal issue can be resolved peacefully and quickly.

However, recently the British and French governments have adopted an ambiguous attitude towards further peaceful negotiations, and have been slow to proceed with negotiations, which cannot but make all those concerned about the peaceful resolution of the canal issue deeply uneasy. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd said in the House of Commons on October 23 that Britain still demanded "international management" of the Suez Canal. At the same time, French Foreign Minister Pineau, in a statement on the outcome of the British-French Foreign Ministers' meeting, said that Britain and France still insisted on the "Eighteen-Nation Proposal demanding the internationalization of the Suez Canal." The British and French Foreign Ministers also attempted to shift the responsibility for delaying negotiations to Egypt, insisting that Egypt had not put forward any "constructive proposals."

It is unreasonable for the British and French governments to trot out the so-called "Eighteen-Nation Proposal" when the Security Council has already adopted six principles as the basis for negotiating a solution to the Suez Canal issue. The "Eighteen-Nation Proposal," which blatantly violates Egyptian sovereignty, has not only been sternly rejected by Egypt but also rejected by the Security Council. Britain and France deliberately bring out this so-called "Eighteen-Nation Proposal," which completely violates the six principles they themselves agreed to, and attempt to impose it on Egypt. This is clearly creating obstacles, making trouble unreasonably, and deliberately trying to strangle all hope of resolving the Suez Canal issue through peaceful negotiations in advance.

To say that Egypt has not put forward "constructive proposals" is a gross distortion of the facts. Since the Suez Canal issue arose, Egypt has consistently advocated peaceful negotiations and has repeatedly put forward constructive proposals sufficient to promote negotiations. Egypt first proposed convening an international conference to revise the 1888 international convention, and later proposed the establishment of a negotiating body to discuss the freedom of navigation, tolls, and maintenance and development of the Suez Canal; after the Security Council meeting, Egypt repeatedly expressed its willingness to negotiate with Britain and France on the basis of the six principles. All this fully demonstrates the sincerity of the Egyptian government in holding peaceful negotiations. It is clear that Britain and France cannot find any excuse to place the responsibility for the failure to start negotiations on Egypt.

The facts show that it is Britain and France that are delaying negotiations. Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi recently pointed out sternly that demanding that Egypt put forward "concrete proposals" before negotiations is in essence a "delaying tactic." News has it that some people in the ruling groups of Britain and France are also planning to delay negotiations on the Suez Canal issue past the US election. They hope that after the election, the US ruling group will be able to support Britain and France in armed intervention in Egyptian sovereignty. US Secretary of State Dulles also stated after the Security Council adopted the six principles that he wanted the situation on the Suez Canal issue to "develop according to the guidelines outlined in the (Eighteen-Nation Proposal)." This attitude of the United States, which disregards the Security Council resolution and the dignity of the United Nations Charter, undoubtedly encourages Britain and France to adopt delaying tactics unfavorable to peaceful negotiations. It is worth noting that Britain and France still maintain tens of thousands of troops in the Eastern Mediterranean and have not taken any measures to ease the situation. The British and French armed threat to Egypt has not been lifted. British Prime Minister Eden recently publicly threatened that Britain does not rule out the possibility of using force against Egypt in the future. These circumstances show that under the firm opposition of Egypt and peace-loving people all over the world, the British, French, and American ruling groups have been forced to retreat, but they have not given up, and they still have not abandoned their attempt to seize the Suez Canal and carry out armed intervention. This cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of all those concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue.

### 英法为什么节外生枝

    英法为什么节外生枝
    联合国安全理事会就苏伊士运河问题通过的六项原则，为通过和平谈判解决这个问题奠定了基础。世界各国公正舆论都希望有关国家在这个基础上进行谈判，使苏伊士运河问题能够迅速得到和平解决。
    但是，最近英、法两国政府对于进一步举行和平谈判问题却采取了暧昧的态度，迟迟不肯进行谈判，这使一切关心运河问题和平解决的人们不能不深感不安。英国外交大臣劳埃德在10月23日对下院说，英国仍然要求对苏伊士运河实行“国际管理”。同时，法国外交部长比诺就英法外长会谈的结果发表谈话说：英法仍然坚持“要求苏伊士运河国际化的十八国建议”。英法两国外长并且企图把延宕举行谈判的责任推到埃及身上，硬说埃及方面还没有提出什么“建设性的建议”。
    英、法两国政府在安理会已经通过六项原则作为谈判解决苏伊士运河问题基础的情况下，仍然搬出所谓“十八国建议”来，是没有任何道理的。露骨地侵犯埃及主权的“十八国建议”，不仅早为埃及所严词拒绝，而且也为安全理事会所否决。英法故意搬出这个完全违反它们自己所同意的六项原则的所谓“十八国建议”，企图强加在埃及身上，这显然是在节外生枝，无理取闹，存心想在事先就扼杀经由和平谈判以解决苏伊士运河问题的一切希望。
    说埃及没有提出“建设性建议”，这更是对事实的极大歪曲。埃及自苏伊士运河问题发生以来，一直主张举行和平谈判，并不止一次地提出了足以促成谈判的建设性的建议。埃及先曾提出了召开国际会议修订1888年国际公约的建议，后又提出了成立谈判机构以商讨苏伊士运河的航行自由、通行费以及运河的保养及发展等问题的建议；而在安理会会议以后，埃及又一再表示愿意同英、法以六项原则为基础进行谈判。这些都充分地说明了埃及政府对举行和平谈判的诚意。英、法企图把谈判没有开始的责任放到埃及身上，显然是找不到任何借口的。
    事实表明，在拖延举行谈判的正是英国和法国。埃及外交部长法齐最近曾严正地指出，要求埃及在谈判前提出“具体的建议”实质上就是一种“拖延手段”。有消息说，英、法两国的统治集团中有人还打算要把苏伊士运河问题的谈判拖过美国大选。他们希望美国统治集团在大选以后，能够放手支持英、法去对埃及主权进行武装干涉。美国国务卿杜勒斯在安理会通过六项原则以后，也曾表示要使苏伊士运河问题的形势“根据（十八国建议）概述的方针得到发展。”美国这种无视安理会决议，蔑视联合国宪章的尊严的态度，无疑地鼓励了英法采取不利于和平谈判的拖延手段。值得注意的是，英、法两国迄今仍然在东地中海保持着数万兵力，并没有采取任何和缓局势的措施。英法对于埃及的武装威胁仍未解除。英国首相艾登最近并公然扬言，英国今后并不排除对埃及使用武力的可能性。这些情况说明，英、法、美统治集团在埃及和全世界爱好和平人民的坚决反对下，不得不被迫作了退却，但是它们并没有死心，它们仍没有放弃夺取苏伊士运河和武力干涉的企图。这不能不引起一切关心和平解决苏伊士运河问题的人们的严重警惕。
