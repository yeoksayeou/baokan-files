    A Little Note on Seeking Spring
    Wu Zuguang
    Watching Sichuan Opera in Kunming
    If there is spring in autumn, we also have great good fortune in misfortune in cloudy weather on sunny days.
    I really enjoy watching Sichuan opera. Sichuan opera is a genre with a deep tradition, rich and colorful, and full of clever wisdom. In recent years, every time I watch Sichuan opera, the artistic enjoyment and intellectual enlightenment are unparalleled.
    The Chongqing Sichuan Opera Theater arrived in Kunming almost at the same time as us. They will be giving touring performances here for two months, which is an unexpected joy for our film crew who were at a loss due to the rainy weather. The enthusiastic Sichuan Opera Theater made it easy for us to see the shows. Although their tickets were often sold out three days in advance, we managed to see almost all of their performances. I have seen their two major productions: "Mu Guiying Battles Hongzhou City," "The Story of the Secluded Chamber," and nearly twenty single-act excerpts.
    The sheer wealth of this genre is rare. Most of the programs seen this time were programs I had not seen before, and the actors seen this time were also actors I had not seen before. As for the programs, each program has its own brilliance; as for the actors, each actor also has their own brilliance.
    The Sichuan opera actors I have seen in Beijing, in the female roles, include Yang Youhe, Yang Yunfeng, Chen Shufang, Xu Qianyun, Dong Ruling... This time we saw Qiong Lianfang, Ping Ping, Qin Shuhui, Lin Qinxin; the young male roles I have seen in Beijing include Yuan Yukun, Zeng Ronghua, Xie Wenxin, Jiang Shangfeng, Zhou Wenfeng... This time we saw Wu Huixin, Li Wenyun; the clowns I have seen in Beijing include Zhou Yuxiang, Liu Chengji, Chen Quanbo, Zhou Qihe... This time we saw Li Wenjie, Xiao Nong... Sichuan opera has so many lovely programs, and Sichuan opera has so many lovely actors.
    Mr. Zhou Mulian, the old director of the Chongqing Sichuan Opera Theater, is fifty-six years old this year. He is the master of female roles in Sichuan opera. He is still performing and is still studying and improving his many outstanding programs. His humble and sincere attitude towards learning and working is truly inspiring. He will also participate in a few performances, and I am waiting to see his show.
    Not being able to go out to shoot movies, watching Sichuan opera is our greatest comfort. I have become a Sichuan opera publicity motivator in the film crew, so that comrades who were originally not interested, and even said they "couldn't understand" it, have also been conquered by Sichuan opera. What makes us happy is not just this. The Chongqing Sichuan Opera Theater has cultivated a group of young male and female students; these children are at most eighteen years old, and at least only twelve years old; they have only studied for three years, but they have already shown dazzling brilliance on the stage. Like Liu Maozhao, who plays the younger sister Jiang Ruilian in "The Story of the Secluded Chamber." Her expressions, gestures, singing, and dialogue are performed with ease and agility; her seamless cooperation with the famous actress Ping Ping makes this clever and sensible younger sister very lovable.
    As a Sichuan opera enthusiast, I am happy for Sichuan opera. Their new generation has reconnected with the older generation of actors. These young people have also caught up with a good time. This not only means national liberation politically, but also an era of ideological and artistic liberation of "letting a hundred flowers bloom"; they can learn and do much more than they could three years ago. Their achievements are limitless. The Chongqing Sichuan Opera Theater plans to come to Beijing to perform next year, and I really hope they come.
    We have become good friends with the comrades of the Sichuan Opera Theater; and we are especially close to those future great actors, the current young actors. They also love our film cause in the same way. All the actors of the Sichuan Opera Theater have been filmed by our camera in the spring in the autumn of Kunming.
    The sun is out again
    The cloudy days are over. These days the sunshine is great, and the blue sky after the rain is even clearer. We have picked up our cameras again and are running all over Kunming city and the near suburbs. Wherever the spring is, we chase after it; we want to bring the eternal spring to those who have not been to Kunming.

    寻春小记
    吴祖光
    在昆明看川戏
    假如说秋天里有春天，我们在晴天的阴天里亦有不幸中之大幸。
    我非常喜欢看川戏。川戏是一个传统深厚，多姿多彩，充满着聪明智慧的剧种。这些年来，我每看一次川戏，无论在艺术上的享受和知识上的启发都是难以伦比的。
    重庆市川剧院和我们前后脚来到昆明。他们将在这里作两个月的旅行演出，这对我们在阴雨天气里走头无路的摄制组说来乃是意外之喜。热情的川剧院给了我们看戏的方便，尽管他们的戏票经常卖到三天以后，但是我们把他们演出的节目几乎都看到了。我看过了他们演出的两个大戏：“穆桂英大战洪州城”，“幽闺记”和近二十出单折子戏。
    这个剧种的“本钱”之厚是少有的。这次看到的节目大都是以前没有看过的，这次看到的演员也是以前没有看过的。拿节目来说，一个节目有一个节目的光彩；拿演员来说，一个演员也有一个演员的光彩。
    在北京看过的川戏演员，旦角里有阳友鹤，杨云凤，陈书舫，许倩云，董汝陵……这回我们看到了琼莲芳、苹萍，秦淑惠，林琴新；在北京看过的小生有袁玉堃，曾荣华，谢文新，江尚峰，周文风……这回我们看到了吴辉新，李文韵；在北京看过的小丑有周裕祥，刘成基，陈全波，周企何……这回我们看到了李文杰，笑侬……川戏有多少可爱的节目，川戏就有多少可爱的演员。
    重庆市川剧院的老院长周慕莲先生今年五十六岁了。他是川戏旦角的宗师。他还在演戏，而且还在钻研改进他的许多杰出的节目。他是虚心而又诚恳的，学习和工作态度真是令人感动。他也将参加演出几场，我在等待看他的戏。
    不能出去拍片子，看川戏就是我们最大的安慰了。我在摄制组里作了川戏的宣传鼓动员，使得同志们原来没有兴趣的，甚至说“看不懂”的也被川戏征服了。使我们高兴的还不止此，重庆市川剧院培养了一批年青的男女学生；这些孩子们最大的十八岁，最小的只有十二岁；他们只学了三年，但是在台上已经显出了逼人的光彩。像刘卯钊，她饰演“幽闺记”中的妹子蒋瑞莲。她的表情，身段，唱和白口，演来从容伶俐；和著名的演员苹萍合作的丝丝入扣，把这一个聪明懂事的妹子演得非常可爱。
    作为一个川戏的爱好者，我为川戏喜欢，他们的新生一代又和老一辈的演员接上气了。这些年青人又恰恰赶上了好时候，这不仅仅意味着政治上的全国解放，而又是“百家争鸣”的思想、艺术解放的时代；他们能学到的和作到的比起三年前的路子就宽多了。他们的成就是不可限量的。重庆市川剧院明年想到北京来演出，我真希望他们来。
    我们和川剧院的同志们做了好朋友；和那些将来的大演员，现在的小演员尤其亲热。他们同样地热爱我们的电影事业，川剧院的全体演员都被我们的摄影机拍到昆明的秋天里的春天里来了。
    太阳又出来了
    阴天已经过去了。这些天阳光大好，雨后的蓝天更加朗澈，我们又背起了摄影机在昆明市区和近郊满处跑了。春天在那里，我们就追到那里；我们要把永恒的春天带给没有来过昆明的人。
