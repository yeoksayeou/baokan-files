    Signing Apprenticeship Contracts Actively Improves Technology
    Yumen 3203 Drilling Team Exceeds Drilling Footage Plan
    Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, 28th. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Yao Bingjian reports:) The Yumen Oil Mine Drilling Company's 3203 drilling team had exceeded its entire year's drilling footage plan by 36.2% by October 22nd. From January to September, this team averaged 1,153.64 meters drilled per rig per month, setting the highest record for average monthly drilling speed in China's petroleum drilling industry.
    The 3203 drilling team was newly formed last year, and new apprentices who joined this year account for more than 80% of the team's total. Therefore, improving the technical level of the entire team has become a very important issue. At the beginning of this year, the team formulated a plan, stipulating that regular technical learning sessions would be held three times a week, and apprenticeship contracts were signed between new and old workers to learn technology through on-site operations. All of the more than seventy new apprentices who joined this year have been promoted to formal technical workers after three to four months of learning; the old workers have also all been upgraded. The team also strictly implements technical measures. Before drilling each new well, they ask geological personnel to explain in detail the geological conditions underground and the issues that should be paid attention to during drilling. Before each shift, they also hold pre-shift meetings to discuss and study the technical measures that should be taken during drilling; after each shift, they immediately check the implementation. Therefore, the drilling quality of this team is relatively high, and there have been no situations where drilling progress has been affected due to major accidents.
    The workers also used different drill bits according to different geological conditions, which improved drilling efficiency. For example, when drilling in the Baiyang River exploration area of the Jiuquan Basin, the team used scraper drill bits based on the hardness of the formation, and the footage drilled per unit of time was doubled compared to the general use of roller cone drill bits, and sometimes it was more than quadrupled.

### 订立师徒合同积极提高技术  玉门三二零三钻井队超额完成钻井进尺计划

    订立师徒合同积极提高技术
    玉门三二零三钻井队超额完成钻井进尺计划
    新华社玉门28日电　新华社记者姚秉鉴报道：玉门油矿钻井公司三二零三钻井队到10月22日止已经超额36.2％完成了今年全年的钻井进尺计划。这一队1月到9月平均每台钻机每月钻进一千一百五十三点六四公尺，曾经创造了我国石油钻井平均钻机月速度的最高纪录。
    三二零三钻井队是去年新组成的，今年新参加的学徒又占了全队总人数的80％以上。因此，提高全队的技术水平就成为一个很重要的问题。今年年初，这个队制定了规划，每周规定进行三次定期的技术学习，新老工人之间还订立师徒合同，在现场操作中学习技术。全队七十多名今年参加的新学徒，经过三个月到四个月的学习以后，已经全部升为正式技术工人；老工人也全部升了级。全队还严格执行技术措施。每钻一口新井之前，都请地质人员详细讲解井下地质情况和在钻进中应注意的问题；每班工作之前，也都召开班前会议，讨论研究钻进时应该采取的技术措施；每班工作以后，又随即检查执行的情况。因此这个队的钻井质量较高，没有发生过因重大事故而影响钻井进度的情况。
    工人们还根据不同的地质情况，使用不同的钻头，提高了钻进效率。如在酒泉盆地的白杨河探区钻进时，这个队因为根据地层硬度使用了刮刀钻头，在单位时间内的钻井进尺数比一般使用牙轮钻头时提高了一倍，有时还提高了四倍多。
