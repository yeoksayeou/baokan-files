Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 3rd: Sofia dispatch: Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a speech at the Eighth Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council on September 29th.

	Zhu Xuefan first stated that the Chinese delegation considered Saillant's report to be very important, especially his emphasis in the report on the existence and development of independent trade unions internationally, the importance of exchanging delegations between countries' trade unions, and the possibility and necessity of developing unified actions by trade unions of various countries on common issues such as economics, society, trade union rights, national independence, and the defense of peace.

	Zhu Xuefan then spoke about the international activities of the Chinese trade unions since 1955. He pointed out that in 1955, a total of fifty-six trade union delegations from thirty countries, with four hundred and twenty-five representatives, visited China. This year, the activity has been even more frequent. Up to September, there have been sixty-three delegations from forty countries, with four hundred and sixty-two representatives, visiting China. He said that the Chinese trade unions are willing to establish and strengthen ties with trade union organizations in all countries with which we have no contact or very insufficient contact.

	The Chinese trade unions are willing to do everything possible to promote the convening of the Asian-African trade union conference that is currently being brewed in various aspects. We believe that a gathering of great unity of Asian and African workers, attended by all trade unions from Asian and African countries, is in the interests of the workers of Asian and African countries.

	Zhu Xuefan specially mentioned the friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese trade unions in recent years.

	Zhu Xuefan expressed his warm support for the struggle of the German workers and people against the revival of militarism, and protested against the Adenauer government's illegal act of outlawing the German Communist Party.

	Zhu Xuefan said that based on the international activities of the Chinese trade unions in recent years, we have the following understandings:

	First, our international activities are aimed at the entire working class of every country. Regardless of the size of the country, the size of the trade union, how different the views are, or how different the circumstances are, we do not discriminate against all trade unions in all countries. In order to promote international trade union unity and facilitate mutual contact, we adopt the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences, striving for any, even the smallest, common ground as the basis for developing friendly exchanges, and reserving different opinions, avoiding imposing our own views on others. In this way, we have been able to extensively develop ties and strengthen friendship with trade unions of various types of countries with different tendencies.

	Second, as a member organization of the World Federation of Trade Unions, we believe that the friendly exchanges, mutual cooperation, and coordinated actions between various fraternal member organizations are of great significance.

	Third, we regard bilateral ties as an important way to develop the current international trade union unity movement. This method makes it easier to find common ground between trade unions of various affiliations and to deepen friendship gradually. Of course, we do not give up developing multilateral activities under possible conditions.

	Fourth, our attitude is equal consultation, mutual understanding, voluntary contact, and patient work.

	Zhu Xuefan then talked about the relationship between the national independence movement and the trade union movement. He said that the Chinese working class and people deeply sympathize with and actively support the struggle of all oppressed nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism and for safeguarding national independence.

	He emphasized that the emergence of independent trade unions is closely related to the struggle of oppressed nations for independence. The Chinese trade unions agree that the World Federation of Trade Unions and its member organizations should generally adopt a policy of friendly cooperation towards independent trade unions. This is an important direction for promoting the unity of the international labor movement in the future.

	Zhu Xuefan said that the Chinese trade unions fully endorse the call to support Egypt passed by this Council. The Chinese workers stand firmly with the Egyptian people along with the entire people. He pointed out the various expressions and actions of the Chinese trade unions and the working class in supporting Egypt, and said that the Chinese workers and the entire people will never stand idly by to any step taken by imperialism to dare to infringe on Egyptian sovereignty, and believe that the Egyptian people will achieve the final victory in this struggle.

	Zhu Xuefan finally described the achievements made by the Chinese trade unions in leading the Chinese workers in building socialism and improving the material and cultural living standards of workers and staff.

    在世界工联理事会第八次会议上
    朱学范的发言
    据新华社布拉格3日电　索非亚消息：中华全国总工会副主席朱学范9月29日在世界工会联合会理事会第八次会议上发了言。
      朱学范首先表示中国代表团认为赛扬的报告很重要，特别是他在报告中着重叙述了国际上独立工会的存在和发展，强调了各国工会交换代表团的重要性，以及在经济、社会、工会权利、民族独立、保卫和平等共同问题上发展各国工会统一行动的可能性和必要性。
    朱学范接着谈到中国工会从1955年以来的国际活动。他指出，1955年，来中国访问的工会代表团一共有三十个国家的五十六个代表团，四百二十五名代表。今年则更为频繁。到9月中为止，来中国的有四十个国家的六十三个代表团的四百六十二名代表。他说，中国工会愿意同所有和我们尚无联系或者联系很不够的国家的工会组织建立和加强联系。
    中国工会愿意尽一切力量促进目前在各方面酝酿中的亚非工会会议的召开。我们相信，一个有亚非各国一切工会参加的一次亚非工人大团结的集会是符合亚非各国工人的利益的。
    朱学范特别提到了中国工会和日本工会之间近年来的友好往来。
    朱学范表示热烈支持德国工人和人民反对复活军国主义的斗争，抗议阿登纳政府取缔德国共产党的非法行为。
    朱学范说，根据最近几年来中国工会的国际活动，我们有以下体会：
    第一，我们的国际活动是以各个国家的全体工人阶级为对象的，不论国家大小、工会大小、见解如何不同、处境如何不同，我们对所有国家的所有工会是不加歧视的。为了推进国际工会的统一、便于相互联系，我们是采取求同存异的原则，争取任何一点即使是最小的共同点，作为发展友好往来的基础，对于不同的意见则加以保留，避免将自己的见解强加于别人。这样，我们才得以广泛地与各种类型的国家各种不同倾向的工会发展了联系，加强了友谊。
    第二，作为世界工联的会员团体，我们认为各个兄弟会员团体之间的友好往来、相互合作、配合行动具有很重要的意义。
    第三，我们把双边联系看做是发展当前国际工会统一运动的一种重要方式。这种方式便于在各种不同所属的工会间找到共同点，并且易于由浅而深地增进彼此间的友谊。当然在可能条件下，我们并不放弃发展多边活动。
    第四，我们的态度是平等协商、彼此谅解、自愿联系、耐心工作。
    朱学范接着谈到民族独立运动对于工会运动的关系问题。他说，中国工人阶级和人民深切地同情并且积极地支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲一切被压迫民族反对殖民主义和维护民族独立的斗争。
    他强调，独立工会的出现与被压迫民族争取独立斗争有着密切的关系。中国工会赞成世界工联及其会员团体对独立工会一般地采取友好合作的政策。这是今后促进国际工运统一的一个重要方向。
    朱学范说，中国工会完全拥护这次理事会所通过的支持埃及的号召，中国工人与全体人民坚决地站在埃及人民一边。他指出了中国工会和工人阶级支持埃及的各种表示和行动，并且说，中国工人和全国人民对于帝国主义敢于侵犯埃及主权的任何一个步骤决不能袖手旁观，并且相信在这一斗争中埃及人民一定会取得最后的胜利。
    朱学范最后叙述了中国工会领导中国工人群众在建设社会主义以及提高职工物质和文化生活水平方面所取得的成就。
