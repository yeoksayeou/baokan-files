Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 20th: Hunan Province, a major oil-tea producing area, will have a total oil-tea production of over 600,000 dan this year, a better harvest than in 1955. Currently, in the southeastern and western mountainous areas of Hunan, male and female commune members are in groups carrying baskets up the mountains to pick oil-tea fruit in the extensive oil-tea forests. In Hanshou County, an oil-tea producing area where harvesting began earlier, the oil-tea fruit harvested this year has generally increased by 25% compared to last year. From the current harvest situation in Pingjiang County, a major oil-tea producing area in the province, it is estimated that the yield will increase by about 30% compared to last year. The 500,000+ mu of oil-tea in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture will also increase production by about 20% compared to last year.

Hunan Province is one of China's major camellia oil producing areas, with a good year yielding about 600,000 dan. This year's production will exceed this figure.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 20th: Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, China's famous tung oil producing area, has had a bumper tung oil harvest. According to preliminary estimates from relevant departments of the autonomous prefecture, this year's tung oil production will be about 200,000+ dan, an increase of nearly 100% compared to last year. These days, Miao and Han farmers in the autonomous prefecture are flocking to the deep mountains to harvest tung seeds.

The Xiangxi area has large areas of tung oil forests, which are a major source of sideline income for Miao and Han farmers. This year, the People's Committee of the Autonomous Prefecture led Miao and Han farmers in reclaiming more than 520,000 mu of tung oil forest. The Autonomous Prefecture Forestry Department has also formulated a long-term plan for constructing tung oil forests. By 1967, the Autonomous Prefecture's tung oil production will be fifteen times higher than in 1955.

This year, the autonomous prefecture's oil-tea has also had a good harvest. The prefecture's 500,000+ mu of oil-tea will increase production by an average of about 20% compared to last year.
