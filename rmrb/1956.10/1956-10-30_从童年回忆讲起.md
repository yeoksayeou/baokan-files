    Starting from Childhood Memories
    Zhang Bojun

    The Chinese people, in order to express sincere respect and profound remembrance for Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the bourgeois revolutionary movement—overthrowing the Qing Dynasty and establishing the Republic of China—will hold grand celebrations nationwide on November 12th to commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Mr. Sun's birth. This solemn and grand event is of great historical and practical significance.

    To Mr. Sun, I am a junior; having joined the revolutionary ranks, I am a latecomer. During Mr. Sun's lifetime, I did not have the opportunity to admire his demeanor and receive his teachings in person. Thinking of it now, I feel even more reverence! In my childhood, I grew up in a remote mountain village. It was two or three years after the 1898 Reform Movement. At that time, I was only six or seven years old. The village children, about a dozen of them, somehow learned a fighting game called "Catch Sun Wen," "Catch Kang Liang," which meant capturing Mr. Sun Yat-sen and Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, saying they were rebels and officials were sent to catch them. All the children were divided into two groups, one group was the officials, mostly older children, who thought they could catch the rebels, and the other group was Sun, Kang, and Liang, the rebels, mostly younger children, and I was one of them, often chased all over the mountains by the "officials." This was the first time I participated in revolutionary activities, establishing an innocent connection with the great Mr. Sun Yat-sen. In the winter of 1911, I was studying at Tongcheng Middle School in Anhui. Just after finishing the graduation exam, the Wuchang Uprising and revolution broke out, overthrowing the Qing Dynasty. About a thousand students from primary and secondary schools in Tongcheng city and countryside held a lantern parade to celebrate. I was also a member of the parade, shouting the slogan "Support Sun and Huang," which meant Mr. Sun Yat-sen and Huang Xing. In 1920, I worked as a "Supervisor" and taught "Cultivation" at the Second Agricultural School in Wuhu, Anhui. It was the year after the May Fourth Movement. I bought Sun Wen's Doctrine (The Fundamentals of National Reconstruction) for the first time and read it superficially, because I wanted to infuse some new ideas into the Cultivation textbooks of the Beiyang Ministry of Education at that time. So I combined Mr. Sun's remarks on easy action and difficult knowledge in psychological construction with what I knew about Wang Yangming's theory of knowledge and action and compiled my own set of ideas. This was the beginning of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary thoughts and theories meeting my needs. In 1925, I was studying in Berlin, Germany. At that time, the Kuomintang had a branch organization in Berlin, and I joined the Kuomintang. When the news of Mr. Sun's death reached Berlin, everyone felt extremely sad. After holding a memorial service, the overseas organizations of the Kuomintang also disintegrated along with the division of the entire party at home. At this time, I also followed Mr. Sun's three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers to join the democratic progressive faction of the Kuomintang. Today, although I am no longer a Kuomintang member, I sincerely admire Mr. Sun's great bourgeois revolutionary progressive thoughts and revolutionary achievements. I will never forget them and am happy to take him as my teacher.

    The evolution of life is complex, but the laws of social and historical development can always be found. Generally speaking, things that are correct, progressive, and in line with human nature and physical requirements can exist, develop, and be realized. I have read the part on material construction in the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction: the Industrial Plan, from the first to the fourth plan—all belonging to the construction plan for developing China's transportation industry, such as highways, shipping, ports, and railways and telecommunications. An independent, prosperous, and strong China with a large population must have such a large-scale and modern transportation construction. Only then can our country be truly independent, prosperous, and strong, and the people can have truly modern livelihoods. Today, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the working class, the Chinese people have united all classes, strata, nationalities, and democratic parties across the country, completed the unfinished great cause of the bourgeois democratic national revolution initiated by Mr. Sun, and eliminated the joint rule of feudal landlords, bureaucratic compradors, and imperialism, and have further transitioned to socialist revolution and socialist construction. Therefore, Mr. Sun's ideals for national construction have been gradually realized.

    In his industrial plan for national construction, Mr. Sun Yat-sen proposed a comprehensive, long-term, and grand plan for the development of China's transportation industry, such as 100,000 miles of railways, one million miles of gravel roads, dredging existing canals, opening the Songliao Canal, and managing the Yellow River, Huai River, Yangtze River, and West River. He also proposed increasing telegraph, telephone, and radio communications to spread throughout the country. Furthermore, he proposed building huge seaports and inland river commercial ports in the northern, central, and southern parts of China, and so on. These are all constructive ideals that revitalize the country, inspire people, and pioneer the way for future generations. These are all legacies that we should cherish.

    Today, I am honored to be appointed to manage the national transportation work, such as highways, shipping, and port construction. I am deeply ashamed that I have not studied Mr. Sun's transportation construction ideas and plans earlier! I hope that comrades in charge of long-term transportation construction plans nationwide will conduct necessary research on Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, develop and promote it. We cannot forget our ancestors, and later generations should learn from their predecessors. If we insist that everything is our creation and there are no predecessors, then we are too proud.

    Lu Fangweng has a poem: "When the King's army pacifies the Central Plains, do not forget to tell your father at the family sacrifice." On the joyful occasion of commemorating the ninetieth anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, the Chinese people can also learn from his intention and tell Mr. Sun: Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have completed the national revolution, driven out the imperialists, and all nationalities have been completely united. A strong China has stood up! More extensive and reasonable socialist democratic and free rights than those of the bourgeoisie have been grasped by the people and are becoming increasingly consolidated and developed! Farmers who have been poor for a long time have moved from the land reform step of implementing land to the tillers to the advanced stage of agricultural production cooperation, and their lives have been generally improved! The working class has become the leading class of the country, actively producing, and improving their living standards and cultural level! The suggestion of "learning from Russia" has been put into practice and has proven effective! And the Principle of People's Livelihood, which is the ideal of socialism and communism, is being realized through the continuous bourgeois democratic revolution led by the Chinese working class and the Communist Party, transitioning to socialist revolution.

    从童年回忆讲起
    章伯钧
    中国人民为了对资产阶级革命运动——倾复清廷创建民国——之父孙中山先生表示真诚的崇敬和深远的怀念，将于11月12日在全国范围内举行孙先生诞辰九十周年纪念，这一庄严隆重的事件是具有重大的历史意义和现实意义的。
    对孙先生来说，我是一个后生，参加革命行列，我又是一个后进，孙先生在世之日，我没有获得瞻仰风采亲承教导的机会。即今思之，就更有儒慕之感了！我童年时代，生长在一个穷乡僻壤的山村中。正当1898年戊戍政变后二、三年，那时我只是六、七岁光景。同村的儿童约有十余个，也不知从那里传来或学来的一种互打的游戏，叫作“捉孙文”“捉康梁”，就是捉拿中山先生和康有为、梁启超，说他们造反，派官兵来捉。全部儿童分作两起，一起是官兵，年长的儿童居多，以为他们可以捉到造反的，一起是孙、康、梁造反者，年幼的较多，我也是当中一员，往往被“官兵”赶得满山乱跑乱窜。这是我第一次参加造反活动，同伟大的中山先生取得了天真童稚的联系。1911年冬我在安徽桐城中学读书，正考完毕业考试，武昌起义，革命爆发，推翻了清廷，桐城城乡中小学约有千人光景举行了一次提灯庆祝游行大会，我又是参加游行的一员，曾高呼过“拥护孙黄”的口号，那就是中山先生和黄兴。1920年我在安徽芜湖第二农业学校做“学监”工作兼教“修身”，正是“五四”运动后一年，我第一次买到孙文学说（建国方略），粗浅地阅读过，因为想把一点新东西渗透到当时北洋教育部的修身教科书里去，所以就把孙先生的行易知难心理建设的言论和我平素所知一点王阳明的知行学说，杂凑了起来编成我的一套。这是孙中山先生的革命思想和理论开始供应了我的需要。1925年我在德国柏林读书，当时中国国民党在柏林有支部组织，我参加了国民党，中山先生逝世消息传到了柏林，大家都感到异常的悲痛。在举行追悼会以后，国民党海外组织也就随着国内全党的分化而分化了。在这时，我也是随着中山先生的联俄、联共、扶助农工三大政策的大旗而走到国民党民主进步派这方面来了，今天我虽然不再是国民党党员，但我对于中山先生之伟大的资产阶级革命的前进思想和革命功勋是由衷地崇敬，念念不忘，乐以为师的。
    人生演变，固属万端，然社会历史的发展规律，总可寻找出来，大凡正确的进步的合乎人情物理之要求的事物，总是可以存在、发展而得实现的。我曾经读过建国方略中之物质建设部分实业计划，自第一到第四计划——均属于开发中国交通运输事业之建设计划，如公路、航运、港口和铁道电讯等计划。一个人口众多独立富强的中国，必须有这样规模宏大的现代化的交通建设，也必须有这样规模宏大的现代化的交通建设，而后我们的国家才可以真正独立富强，人民才可有真正现代化的民生。今天中国人民已经在中国共产党和工人阶级正确的领导下，团结了全国各阶级各阶层各民族和各民主党派，完成了中山先生所首创的资产阶级民主民族革命未竟之伟业，消灭了封建地主官僚买办和帝国主义联合统治政权而又进一步过渡到社会主义革命和社会主义建设了。因而中山先生之建国理想就已经逐步实现了。
    中山先生在建国的实业计划中，对于开发中国交通运输事业提出了全般的长远的规模宏伟的计划，如十万英里铁路，碎石路一百万英里，修浚现有运河，新开松辽运河，整治黄河、淮河、长江和西江等内河；增设电报、电话、及无线电等，使遍布于全国。又如在中国中南北三部，各建巨大海港和内河商港等等。这都是振兴邦国鼓舞人心，发前人所未发，开后人之先驱的建设理想。这都是值得我们加以珍视的遗产。
    我今天承乏受命，管理全国交通运输工作，如公路、航运、建港诸方面。对于孙先生的交通建设思想和计划则未能早加钻研，深感惭愧！但愿全国掌管交通长期建设计划的同志，对孙中山先生的建国方略进行必要的研究，加以发展和宣扬。数典不能忘祖，后人应向前人学习，如必曰事皆我创，前无古人，则未免过于自豪了。
    陆放翁有句云“王师北定中原日，家祭母忘告乃翁。”中国人民在纪念中山先生九十周年诞辰之喜日，也可以略师其意，奉告中山先生：在中国共产党领导下，中国人民已完成了民族革命，赶走了帝国主义，全国各民族已完全团结起来，强大的中国已经站立起来了；比资产阶级更广泛的合理的社会主义的民主自由权利已经掌握在人民手中，并且日趋巩固，日趋发扬了；长期贫苦的农民，已经由实行耕者有其田的土地改革步骤而进到高级农业生产合作阶段，生活已普遍地改善了；工人阶级已做了国家的领导阶级，积极生产，提高生活和文化水平了；“以俄为师”的提示，已经见诸实行，而且行之有效了；而民生主义就是社会主义和共产主义的理想，也正由中国工人阶级和共产党所领导完成之资产阶级民主革命连续于社会主义革命而得到实践了。
