    Residents of Major Northern Cities and Industrial and Mining Areas
    Can Eat Guangdong Vegetables This Winter and Next Spring
    (Our newspaper dispatch) A large quantity of Guangdong vegetables will be continuously transported to the capital of the motherland, major northern cities, and industrial and mining areas to supply the needs of the people. According to preliminary plans by the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture, from this winter to May of next year, approximately 800,000 dan of cucumbers, eggplants, peppers, and other vegetables will be produced specifically for transport to the north, an increase of four times compared to the same period last year. Currently, farmers in the Pearl River Delta and the suburbs of Guangzhou, the main vegetable-producing areas, have already sown seeds early and organized technically skilled members to be responsible for cultivation and management. The seedlings prepared for transport to the north in Nanhai County are already growing lush and green.
    Vegetables produced in Guangdong are not only high in yield but also relatively low in cost.
    Producing vegetables for transport to the north requires chemical fertilizers and relatively high technology, as well as increased transportation equipment. The Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Provincial Vegetable Company are actively taking effective measures to overcome various difficulties and promote the realization of the plan.

    北方一些大城市和工矿区居民
    今冬明春可以吃到广东蔬菜
    本报讯　大批的广东蔬菜将源源运往祖国首都、北方各大城市和工矿地区，供应人民的需要。广东省农业部门初步规划在今冬到明年5月之间，专为北运而生产的黄瓜、茄子、辣椒等约有八十万担，比去年同时期增加四倍。现在，主产蔬菜的珠江三角洲和广州市郊区的农民已经提早播下种子，组织技术熟练的社员负责栽培管理工作，南海县准备北运的菜苗已长得一片青绿了。
    广东生产的蔬菜，不仅产量高，成本也比较低。
    生产北运的蔬菜需要化学肥料和比较高的技术，同时还要求增加运输设备。广东省农业部门和省蔬菜公司正积极采取有效措施，克服各种困难，促使计划的实现。
