Xinhua News Agency, 16th — The full text of the Belgian parliamentary delegation's statement is as follows:
To Mr. Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China:

We deeply thank you for your kindness in inviting us to visit China.

Your great and beautiful country has left a deep impression on us.

You invited us to visit so that we could understand how you overcame various difficulties, and these difficulties are not completely unknown to Western countries. Today we have further understood these situations. We want to express our respect to you, because you are almost the only ones who, within a range as large as Europe, have overcome many difficulties calmly, deliberately and disciplinedly based on the characteristics of that thousands-year civilization. Now this country has 600 million people. You mentioned to us that a long time ago, when we became a specialized and rare advanced country in the tram and train transportation industry, you invited our experts to cooperate with you in building bridges and railways.

Today we would like to tell you that we are very willing to restore this cooperation, because it is beneficial to both countries.

We are an industrial country and also engaged in agriculture, but first of all we are a peaceful country. We have no ambitions of aggression at all. Our greatest wish is to live in peace with all countries in the East and West hemispheres.

The result of our visit to your country this time should be to improve economic relations, make a direct contribution to the establishment of comprehensive peace and prosperity, and hope that the political difficulties that remain to be resolved will be resolved as soon as possible. Here, we only congratulate you, because we recognize that you have a large population, a vast territory, and a long history, which is superior to us, which is an undeniable fact.

Mr. Chairman:

The Belgian parliamentary delegation once again asks you to convey our high respect to the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and please thank the head of your government, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the heads of the provinces and cities we have visited on our behalf. We are grateful for the sincere assistance given to us by your reception staff during our trip of more than 11,000 kilometers in your vast territory.

This visit will leave an indelible impression in the memory of each of us throughout our lives.

    新华社16日讯　比利时王国国会代表团声明，全文如下：中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长先生：
    我们深深感谢你们邀请我们访问中国的盛意。
    你们伟大而美丽的国家给我们留下了深刻的印象。
    你们邀请我们来访问是为了使我们了解你们是怎样克服种种困难，而这些困难并不是西方国家所完全不晓得的。今天我们已经进一步地了解这些情况。我们要向你们表示敬意，因为你们几乎是唯一的在和欧洲同样大的范围内，根据那种几千年文明的特点，冷静地、深思熟虑地和有纪律地克服了许多困难。现在这个国家有着六亿人口。你们曾经向我们提到，在很久以前，当我们在电车、火车运输工业方面成为具有特长的、少有的先进国家时，你们曾经邀请我们的专家和你们合作建设桥梁和铁路。
    今天我们愿意告诉你们，我们很希望恢复这种合作，因为这对两国都是有利的。
    我们是工业国，同时也从事农业，但首先我们是一个和平的国家。我们丝毫没有侵略的野心，我们最大的愿望就是同东西两半球的所有国家在和平中生活。
    我们这一次到你们国家所得到的结果应该是改善经济关系，对全面和平的建立和繁荣作出直接的贡献，并且希望尚待解决的政治方面的困难早日获得解决。在这里，我们仅向你们祝贺，因为我们认识到你们人口众多，地域广大，而且历史悠久，这较我们优越，这是不可否认的事实。
    委员长先生：
    比利时国会代表团再一次请你们把我们的崇高敬意转达给中华人民共和国主席，并请替我们向贵国政府首长、全国人民代表大会常务委员会以及我们访问过的省、市的首长表示感谢。在贵国辽阔地域内长达一万一千多公里的旅行中，你们的招待人员给了我们诚挚的协助，我们表示感谢。
    这次访问将在我们每个人的一生中的记忆里留下不可磨灭的印象。
