Stepping into Beiqijiazhuang, the location of the Hongsheng Agricultural Cooperative's management committee, one sees no idle people anywhere. At the north end of the village, five or six young women are weighing the fertilizer accumulated by cooperative members in front of their houses, basket by basket; at the south end of the village, several middle-aged women are hammering clumps of fertilizer beside the manure pile; and three or four strong women are busy loading carts, preparing to send manure to the wheat fields. On the wide open ground, many old ladies and pregnant women, chatting and laughing, are picking out the long, large, and full corn cobs, ready to hand them over as public grain. In the village, I saw women working everywhere, except for the male cooperative members who were driving the carts to deliver fertilizer. Liu Jinshan (female), the deputy director of the cooperative, said proudly to me: "If women hadn't participated in the work, our cooperative would have had some uncultivated land this year."

Hongsheng Cooperative is one of the largest cooperatives in Changping District, Beijing, with a large population and even more land. Each laborer has to bear an average of twelve and a half mu of land. After deducting those who are often engaged in sideline occupations, those who are doing civil construction work, and full-time cadres, each laborer has to bear twenty mu of land. This year, the cooperative suffered some flooding, and a larger portion of male labor was transferred to engage in sideline production. The task of planting wheat on several thousand mu of land in the cooperative had to be completed by women. Women took on the responsibility for the seven thousand eight hundred mu of cotton, and most of the harvesting of beans, picking of corn cobs, and threshing were also done by women. When I arrived at the Second Brigade, it was lunchtime. Female cooperative member Lü Yonghui had already eaten and was feeding her child. She looked at the large basket of corn cobs in the middle of the room with a smile, which was the fruit of her labor pre-distributed by the cooperative. As soon as she saw us come in, she happily told us, "Look how good the corn cobs I got are!" The brigade leader who came with me interjected, "According to your work points this year, you can get eight or nine hundred catties of grain!" Lü Yonghui smiled and said, "Then I'll have enough to eat, wear, and use for a year." Lü Yonghui is a young woman whose husband works outside and brings home dozens of yuan in wages every month. In addition, she has a child to take care of, so she rarely went to work in the fields in the past. Last year, in the primary cooperative, her family only received forty or fifty catties of corn cobs from the land distribution. This year, after the establishment of the advanced cooperative, the cooperative often held meetings to talk about the principle that participating in labor is both glorious and can increase production. She felt that she was a young person and that it was not glorious to rely on her husband for food. The cooperative established a nursery, and there was someone to take care of her child, so she actively participated in labor. Therefore, she was especially happy when she received the fruits of her labor.

The work bell rang, and many women hurried to the nursery with their children in their arms, while others were already heading to the fields with sickles and baskets. The women's director told me, "Now the women in the cooperative are very active in their work, and the attendance rate is often above 95%." This reminded me of a story told by the women's captain of the Fourth Brigade. The wife of cooperative member Liu Yukun, known by everyone in the village as "Lazy Woman," had never worked in the fields for a single day in more than ten years, and spent her days either visiting this family or that family. This year, with the establishment of the advanced cooperative, all the women, young and old, in the village went to work in the fields. She had nowhere to go for her visits, and she felt bored at home. Occasionally, when everyone met, they would talk about production, which made her feel ashamed for not working. At the same time, the captain often promoted the benefits of participating in production and increasing income to her, so she gradually began to participate in labor. Now she has earned more than eight hundred work points.

The women's director led me to see the nurseries and kindergartens of each brigade. Everywhere we went, the children greeted us affectionately. Although the equipment in the nurseries was not perfect, everything was cleaned very well, and the children's hands and faces were also washed very clean. Therefore, the nurseries and kindergartens are very popular with parents. The twenty-nine nurseries and kindergartens in the whole cooperative take care of more than six hundred children, freeing up more than four hundred mothers to participate in production. In the nursery of the Ninth Brigade, we met female cooperative member Yuan Fengying, who said, "With the nursery, I am enjoying the blessings of socialism." Last year, she had four children, all very young, and there were no elderly people at home to take care of them. The cooperative did not have any childcare organization, so she had to stay at home every day to take care of the children, and she did not do any work in the fields. This year, the cooperative established a nursery, and she was the first to send the two younger ones there, and the older ones also went to school. She attended work about twenty-five days a month, and in eight months, she earned more than one thousand seven hundred work points, catching up with the work done by a male laborer.

When we arrived at the Eighth Brigade's nursery, the childcare worker Luo Zhenying was coaxing a baby to sleep on the heated kang. Her body was already quite inconvenient, and it looked like she would be giving birth soon. In the past, when Luo Zhenying was working independently, she had three miscarriages in a row due to overwork, and once almost lost her life. This year, she was pregnant again, and her family was both happy and scared. She herself did not dare to go to work in the fields. After the captain learned about this situation, he assigned her to the nursery to take care of three or four babies. This job was not tiring, and she could still get more than one thousand work points. She said gratefully, "The cooperative takes such good care of us women." This year, a total of more than five hundred and forty women in the cooperative became pregnant, but there was not a single case of premature birth or miscarriage. Now, more than one hundred and fifty pregnant women have given birth safely.

How does this cooperative appropriately arrange work for women? It is understood that each women's captain knows the situation of the women in their brigade, and when arranging each stage of production work, they take appropriate care of them based on this situation. Take the current autumn harvest and autumn planting as an example! Women who are seven or eight months pregnant are assigned to do light work on the threshing ground, such as selecting seeds, drying grain, and frying animal feed; those who are five or six months pregnant, some hammer fertilizer clumps, some go to the fields to pick corn cobs; women who are two or three months pregnant can do light work such as picking cotton, harvesting beans, and picking corn cobs, but they are not allowed to do excessively strenuous heavy work. The cooperative members can also understand each other. The brigade tries to let women with breastfeeding children and women who are menstruating do work that is close by and light, and also stipulates that women with breastfeeding children can get off work early to breastfeed. This cooperative regards taking care of women's special interests as an important issue in whether or not the majority of women can be mobilized to participate in production. At the beginning of mobilizing women to participate in production, the Party General Branch of Beiqijiazhuang Township and the cooperative management committee held special meetings to study this issue and stipulated that each brigade should listen to the opinions of the women's captains more when arranging farm work, which also better exerted the role of the women's captains.

When the cooperative mobilized women to produce, it also criticized the feudal ideas of male cooperative members and educated them to help their wives with some housework at home to reduce the burden on women's families. Many harmonious families have emerged in this cooperative, and the phenomenon of quarreling and fighting has almost disappeared. This spirit of mutual respect and mutual help has formed a new atmosphere in the cooperative.

    宏声农业社发挥了妇女的潜力
    陈一超
    走进宏声农业社管理委员会的所在地——北七家庄，满眼看不到一个闲人。村北头，五、六个青年妇女正在一筐筐地称量社员门前自积的肥料；村南头，几个中年妇女在粪堆旁边锤打粪疙瘩；还有三、四个身强力壮的妇女正在紧张地装车，准备往麦地里送粪。宽广的场地上，许多老太太和孕妇，一面谈笑一面把又长又大、颗粒饱满的玉米棒子挑出来，准备缴公粮。我在村里看见的，除赶车送粪的是男社员外，其余到处都是妇女在干活。社的副主任刘金山（女）很自豪地对我说：“要是没有妇女参加干活，俺社今年非荒一些地不可。”
    宏声社是北京市昌平区的大社之一，人多地更多，平均每个劳动力要负担十二亩半地，除去经常搞副业的、出民工的和脱产干部以外，每个劳动力就要负担二十亩地。今年社内受了些水灾，又多抽了一部分男劳力去搞副业生产。社里几千亩种麦任务要靠妇女来完成，七千八百多亩棉花妇女包了，收割豆子、摘玉米棒子、打场的也大部分是妇女。当我来到第二大队的时候，正是中午下工时间。女社员吕永惠已经吃过饭，正在给孩子喂奶。她笑盈盈地望着屋当中满满一大篓的玉米棒子，这是社里预分给她的劳动果实。一见我们进来，她就高兴地告诉我说：“你看我分得的玉米棒子多好！”和我同去的大队长插上说：“按你今年劳动的工分，可分得八、九百斤粮食哩！”吕永惠笑着说：“那我一年的穿吃使用都有了。”吕永惠是一个青年妇女，丈夫在外工作，每月拿回家里几十元工资，又加上有个孩子拖累，过去很少下地干活。去年初级社时，她家只在土地分红中分得四、五十斤玉米棒子。今年成立了高级社，社里经常开会讲参加劳动既光荣又能增加生产的道理，她觉得自己是个青年人，靠丈夫吃饭不光荣，社里成立了托儿所，孩子也有人看了，她便积极参加劳动。所以当她得到自己劳动的果实时，心里就特别欢喜。
    上工号响了，许多妇女都匆匆忙忙地抱着孩子向托儿所那里走，有的已经拿着镰刀、筐子向地里去。妇女主任对我说：“现在社里妇女干活都很积极，出勤率经常在95％以上。”这使我想起四大队妇女队长告诉我的一个故事。社员刘玉琨的妻子，村里人都叫她是“懒婆”，十多年来从未下地干过一天活，整天不是串东家就是溜西家。今年成立了高级社，村里老少妇女都下地干活，她要串门没有地方去，自己呆在家里也感觉闷得慌，偶而大家遇到一块的时候，一谈就谈到生产上去了，这使她感到自己不干活很不光彩，同时队长也经常向她宣传参加生产增加收入的好处，她便逐渐地参加了劳动，现在她已经挣了八百多个工分。
    妇女主任领我去看各队的托儿所和幼儿队。每到一处，孩子们都亲热地打着招呼。托儿所的设备虽然很不完善，但是到处打扫得很清洁，孩子们的手脸也洗得很干净。因此，托儿所和幼儿队很受家长欢迎。全社二十九处托儿所和幼儿队，收托了六百多名孩子，腾出了四百多名妈妈参加生产。在九队的托儿所里，我们遇见了女社员袁凤英，她说：“有了托儿所，我算享了社会主义的福了。”去年她有四个孩子，都很小，家里没有老人照看，社里又没有托儿组织，她只好每天呆在家里看孩子，地里的活一点也没干。今年社里成立托儿所，她首先把两个小的送进去，大的也上了学，她每月出勤都在二十五天左右，在八个月的时间内就挣了一千七百多个工分，赶上一个男劳动力干的活。
    我们到八大队托儿所时，保育员罗振英正在热炕上哄婴儿睡觉，她的身子已经不大方便，看情形很快就要生孩子了。罗振英在过去单干时，由于劳累过度，一连流产了三次，有一次几乎把命送掉。今年她又怀孕了，一家人真是又喜又怕，她自己也不敢下地干活，队长知道这个情况后，就分配她到托儿所去照看三、四个婴儿，这样工作既不累人，还可以得到一千多个工分。她很感激地说：“社里对我们妇女照顾的太好了。”这个社今年共有五百四十多名妇女先后怀了孕，但没有发生过一次早产或流产事故，现在已经有一百五十多名孕妇安全生产了。
    这个社究竟怎样适当安排妇女活路的呢？据了解每个妇女队长都知道自己队里妇女的情况，安排每段生产工作时，便根据这个情况适当地照顾她们。就以现在秋收秋种来说吧！怀孕七、八个月的都分配在场地上做选种、晒场和炒牲畜饲料等轻便活；怀孕五六个月的，有的打粪疙瘩、有的下地摘玉米棒子；怀孕两三个月的，下地摘棉花、割豆子、摘玉米棒子等轻活都可以做，就是不让干过分用力的重活。社员之间也都能互相体谅，队里对有吃奶孩子的妇女和来月经的妇女，也尽量让她们干近活和轻活，并且还规定有吃奶孩子的可以提前下工喂奶。这个社把照顾妇女特殊利益，看成能不能发动大多数妇女参加生产的一个重要问题。在开始发动妇女参加生产时，北七家庄乡的党总支和社管理委员会，都曾专门召开会议研究这个问题，并规定各队在安排农活时，多听取妇女队长的意见，这也就更好地发挥了妇女队长的作用。
    社里在发动妇女生产时，也批判了男社员的封建思想，教育他们在家里帮助自己妻子做些家务活，减轻妇女的家庭负担。这个社出现了许多和睦的家庭，吵嘴打架的现象几乎绝迹。这种互相尊重、互相帮助的精神已在社里形成了一种新风气。
