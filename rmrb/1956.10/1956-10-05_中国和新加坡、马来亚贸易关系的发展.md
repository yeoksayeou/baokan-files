Observer's Commentary

    The Singapore Industrial and Commercial Trade Delegation and the Federation of Malaya Industrial and Commercial Trade Delegation, after friendly and sincere trade talks in Beijing with the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and various Chinese import and export corporations, issued a joint statement on October 4. This joint statement expressed the common desire of the people of China, Singapore, and the Federation of Malaya to develop normal trade between them, and also pointed out the broad prospects for future trade development between them. It is certain that the trade exchanges and friendly relations between China and Singapore, and between China and the Federation of Malaya, will be further developed on this basis.
    This is the first time that business circles from Singapore and Malaya have sent delegations to visit our country. The delegations brought the eager desire of the various ethnic groups of Singapore and Malaya to develop trade and friendship with China, and were warmly welcomed by the Chinese people. We hope that the members of the delegation will bring back to the people of Singapore and Malaya the friendship of the Chinese people and their sincere desire to develop trade and friendly relations with them. While striving to build a better life for themselves, the Chinese people sincerely hope that the various ethnic groups of Singapore and Malaya will unite in friendship and live a peaceful, prosperous, affluent, and happy life.
    For more than five years, from May 1951 to June this year, Singapore and the Federation of Malaya have been subjected to artificial restrictions, which have created undue obstacles to the long-standing trade exchanges between China and Singapore, and between China and Malaya. In early June this year, the governments of Singapore and Malaya first announced the lifting of the "embargo" on rubber to China, which is entirely in line with the interests of the economic development of Singapore and Malaya. The Chinese government and people have always advocated developing trade relations with the governments and people of all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. An important condition for equality and mutual benefit in trade is that both sides of the trade should be able to freely exchange goods according to their own and the other's needs and possibilities, without any discrimination or artificial restrictions. The governments of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya have announced the lifting of the rubber "embargo," which has opened the way for the development of trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. During the visit of the delegation, China has resumed purchasing rubber from Singapore and Malaya. The members of the delegation have also purchased from China a considerable amount of commodities they need. This fully shows that as long as we act according to the principle of equality and mutual benefit, trade can be developed smoothly and beneficially.
    Developing trade plays a positive role in enhancing mutual understanding and friendship. We hope that in the future, trade exchanges and mutual visits between China and Singapore, and between China and the Federation of Malaya, can continue to be strengthened, and that trade can gradually move towards normalization.

    中国和新加坡、马来亚贸易关系的发展
    新加坡工商业贸易考察团和马来亚联合邦工商业贸易考察团同中国国际贸易促进委员会和中国各进出口公司，在北京经过友好、诚恳的贸易商谈，在10月4日发表了联合声明。这个联合声明表达了中国、新加坡、马来亚联合邦人民要求发展彼此间正常贸易的共同愿望，同时也指出了相互间今后贸易发展的宽阔前景。可以肯定，中国和新加坡之间以及中国和马来亚联合邦之间的贸易交流和友好关系，必将在此基础上获得新的发展。
    新加坡和马来亚工商界派遣代表团到我国进行访问，这还是第一次。这次代表团带来了新加坡、马来亚各族人民发展对中国贸易和友谊的热切愿望，受到了中国人民的热诚欢迎。我们希望，考察团的各位团员能把中国人民的友谊和发展彼此间贸易和友好关系的真诚愿望带回给新加坡和马来亚人民。中国人民在努力建设自己美好生活的同时，衷心希望新加坡、马来亚各族人民团结友爱，过着和平、繁荣、富裕和幸福的生活。
    从1951年5月到今年6月的五年多以来，新加坡和马来亚联合邦受到人为的因素的限制，使得历史悠久的中国和新加坡，中国和马来亚之间的贸易来往遭到了不应有的障碍。今年6月初，新加坡、马来亚两地政府首先宣布了解除对中国的橡胶“禁运”，这是完全符合新加坡和马来亚经济发展的利益的。中国政府和人民一贯主张在平等互利基础上同一切国家的政府和人民发展通商贸易关系。贸易上平等互利的一个重要条件，就是贸易双方要能够按照自己和对方的需要和可能，自由地互通有无，而不加以任何歧视或者人为的限制。新加坡和马来亚联合邦政府宣布解除橡胶“禁运”，这就为在平等互利基础上发展贸易开辟了道路。在考察团访问期间，中国已经重新开始购买了新加坡和马来亚的橡胶。考察团的各位团员们，也向中国方面购买了不少自己所需要的商品。这就充分说明：只要根据平等互利的原则办事，贸易就能够得到顺畅和有益的发展。
    发展贸易对于增进彼此之间的了解和友谊有着积极的作用。我们希望今后中国和新加坡、中国和马来亚联合邦之间的贸易来往和相互访问能够继续加强，并且使贸易能够逐渐走向正常。
