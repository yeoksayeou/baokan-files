	The colonial war waged by French imperialists in Indochina was aptly called the "dirty war." In fact, the hands of the French colonialists in North Africa are dirty enough. Taking Algeria as an example, in 1945, French colonial troops massacred 45,000 Arabs there. In recent years, a common and terrifying tactic used by the colonial army against the Algerian guerrillas has been the mass shooting of hostages. In the lingo of bandits, this dirty business is called "tearing up the ticket."

	However, the banditry of the French colonialists is not limited to this. Recently, the French Resident Minister in Algeria, Lacoste, actually used tricks to kidnap five leaders of the "Algerian National Liberation Front" who were invited by the Sultan of Morocco to go to Tunisia to hold talks with the leaders of the two countries. This has added another crime to the dirty record of the French colonialists.

	These five Algerian leaders were kidnapped by French colonialist robbers from a plane piloted by the French. This trick is extremely despicable, but it is not new. This kind of kidnapping in the sky reminds us of the Czechoslovak film "Kidnapping," based on a true story, which was shown in China not long ago. Even if French colonialists can excuse themselves by saying "great minds think alike," it seems to us to be nothing short of plagiarism. After this incident aroused public outrage in the Arab world, Premier Mollet, who had offered a check for negotiations with Algerian nationalists when he came to power, patted his chest in the National Assembly, saying that he himself "did not want to evade responsibility for arresting these rebels," showing the spirit of "a hero taking responsibility for his actions." In fact, for the Premier of a dignified "great power" to resort to such vile means reflects the despair of the colonialists at the end of their rope.

	However, the French colonialists' descent to using kidnapping to deal with the leaders of the Algerian national liberation movement is not without reason. In the eyes of the monopoly consortiums in Paris, "the fate of France is tied to Algeria," and it must not be abandoned. We remember that at the beginning of the Suez Canal crisis, the French authorities, who immediately thought of the situation in North Africa, not only flew into a rage but also drew their swords, fantasizing about taking the opportunity to bring down Nasser so as to preserve Algeria and the entire North African territory. But now, everyone has seen that under the strong resistance and counterattack of the Egyptian people, Mollet and Pineau, who were once eager to fight, have become like the "teacher" in "beating the family after fishing," making a great fool of themselves. Unable to bring down Nasser, the French colonialists, in their anger, turned their vicious hands to the Algerian national leaders. Afterwards, Foreign Minister Pineau, when talking about this incident at a banquet of the Foreign Press Association, even pretended to be the insulted and injured, imitating A Q's tone, saying: "In recent years, France has suffered enough, but this government is determined to have France respected, and I can tell you that we will no longer accept insults from anyone anywhere."

	What "tough" words! But let's not say that France's provocative actions "may force the entire North Africa to contend with France" (the warning from the Tunisian Prime Minister). The French rulers should also remember that the eight years of "dirty war" in Indochina only won the tragic ending of Dien Bien Phu, and should remember that the result of exiling the Sultan of Morocco, Yusuf, was still being forced to reinstate him. This is the serious historical lesson that the anti-colonial twentieth century gave to France. "France has suffered enough," in our view, at least it has not suffered enough historical lessons!

    “绑架”的新“拷贝”
    思慕
    法国帝国主义者在印度支那进行的殖民战争，曾经很恰当地被称为“肮脏战争”。其实，在北非的法国殖民主义者的手，也是够肮脏的，单以阿尔及利亚来说，1945年法国殖民军队就曾经在那里屠杀了四万五千阿拉伯人。近几年来，殖民军队对付阿尔及利亚游击队的一个惯用的恐怖手段，就是集体枪杀人质。用土匪的行话来说，这种肮脏勾当叫做“撕票”。
    但是，法国殖民主义者的土匪行径并不限于此。最近，阿尔及利亚的法国驻节部长拉戈斯特竟然用诡计绑架了应摩洛哥苏丹邀请去突尼斯同两国领袖举行会谈的“阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线”的五个领导人，这又给法国殖民主义者的肮脏纪录添加了一桩。
    这五位阿尔及利亚领袖是从法国人驾驶的飞机上给法国殖民主义强盗绑架了的。这种诡计是十二分卑鄙的，但并不算新鲜。这种在天空中掳人的勾当使我们记起前不多时在中国放映的取材于真实故事的捷克斯洛伐克电影片“绑架”。纵然法国殖民主义者可以拿“英雄所见略同”来解嘲，在我们看来，不无抄袭之嫌。在这个事件激起阿拉伯世界的公愤之后，在上台时曾经开出同阿尔及利亚民族主义者谈判的支票的摩勒总理，却在国民议会上拍胸脯，说他本人“不想逃避逮捕这些叛乱分子的责任”，大有“好汉做事一身当”的气概。其实，堂堂“大国”总理，不惜乞灵于这样下流的手段，正反映出殖民主义者穷途末路的悲哀。
    但是，法国殖民主义者堕落到以绑票的手段来对付阿尔及利民族解放运动的领袖，不是没来由的。在巴黎的垄断财团看来，“法兰西的命运系于阿尔及利亚”，万万放弃不得。我们记得，在苏伊士运河问题发生的初时，马上联想到北非局势的法国当局，不但暴跳如雷，而且剑拔弩张，幻想借这机会把纳赛尔搞垮，就可以保住阿尔及利亚和整个北非的江山。而现在，大家都看到，在埃及人民的坚强抵抗和反击之下，曾经磨拳擦掌、声势汹汹的摩勒、比诺之流却变成了“打鱼杀家”中的教师爷，大出其丑。纳赛尔搞不垮，恼羞成怒的法国殖民主义者，便又向阿尔及利亚民族领袖施毒手。之后，比诺外长在外国新闻工作者协会的宴会中谈到这事件时，还扮作是被侮辱被损害者，仿效阿Q的口吻说：“在近几年中，法国已经受够了，但是，这个政府已经坚决地要使法国受到尊重，并且，我可以告诉你们，我们将不再在任何地方接受任何人的侮辱。”
    好“强硬”的口气呵！但是，我们且不要说法国这种挑衅行动“可能迫使整个北非同法国较量力量”（突尼斯首相的警告），法国统治者也应该记得印度支那八年的“肮脏战争”只赢得了奠边府的悲惨结局，应该记得流放摩洛哥苏丹优素福的结果还是被迫请他复位。这是反殖民主义的二十世纪给法国的严重历史教训。“法国已经受够了”，在我们看来，至少历史的教训还没有受够吧！
