    Do Not Falsely Lower Previous Years' Income

    Some agricultural cooperatives, when formulating autumn harvest distribution plans, in order to achieve the figures of 90% or even 100% of commune members increasing their income, adopted a clever trick: for those commune members whose income this year was less than in previous years, they lowered their total income in previous years and exaggerated their total income this year. Some leading cadres were misled by this illusion, regarding such cooperatives as production and income-increasing cooperatives, without inspection or inquiry. The Dengta Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Township, Xinxian County, Shanxi Province, is such an example. Their distribution plan stated that more than 95% of commune members increased their income, but after careful investigation and accounting, the actual increase in income was only slightly more than 85%. Why is this? When the cooperative calculated their total income last year, grain crops only included the main crop and not the catch crop; only major autumn crops were counted, not minor miscellaneous grains; only grain was counted, not vegetables or potatoes; only major sideline production was counted, not household sideline production. However, when calculating this year's income, even straw was included in the total income. Commune member Wang Shumei produced 1.2 shi of grain per mu when she was farming independently, but the agricultural cooperative calculated it as 1 shi. Recently, her nephew gave her ten yuan, which was also included in this year's income, claiming that her household's income increased by 20%, but in reality, this household's income decreased by more than 10% compared to last year.

    Underestimating This Year's Expenses

    The Hejian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in leading agricultural cooperatives to formulate autumn harvest distribution plans, in order to demonstrate the superiority of agricultural cooperatives, did not include the value of fertilizers invested by commune members in the cooperative as part of the expenses. This made the expenses appear relatively low, the income high, the retention ratio in line with principles, and the amount distributed to commune members high. But this is not the actual situation. Take the Huoyan Agricultural Cooperative in Liugusi as an example. The total income of this cooperative was more than 370,000 yuan, with more than 120,000 yuan retained, accounting for 33.7% of the total income. However, the value of fertilizers invested by commune members was more than 40,000 yuan, accounting for 11% of the total income, but this was not included in the expenses. If this expense is added, it would account for 44.7% of the total income. From this, it can be seen that the spending was actually quite high, but it was insisted that the expenses were not high, in order to show high income and increased income for commune members. I ask, can this be called superiority? Of course not. I hope that we will still treat this issue with a spirit of seeking truth from facts. If production increases, then it increases; if production decreases, then we should investigate the reasons and learn from the lessons. Do not engage in falsification.

    计算社员收入，不要弄虚作假
    压低往年收入
    有些农业社在制定秋收分配方案当中，为了凑90％甚至100％的社员增加收入的数字，就采取了一条妙计——对那些今年比往年减少收入的社员，把他们往年的总收入压低，把今年的总收入夸大。而有些领导干部就被这种假象所迷惑，把这样社当成增产增收社，不检查也不过问。山西忻县城关乡灯塔农业社就是这样的。他们的分配方案上写的是95％以上社员增加收入，经过仔细的考察算账后，真正增加收入的是85％稍多一点。为什么会这样呢？社里给他们计算去年总收入的时候，粮食作物只计算正茬不计算回茬；只算大秋作物不算小杂粮；只算粮食不算蔬菜、马铃薯；只算大副业生产不算家庭副业生产。但是在计算今年收入时，把秸草等都算在总收入中了。社员王书梅单干时一亩实产粮一石二斗，农业社是按一石计算的；最近她外甥给了她十元钱也被计算在今年的收入里了，说她是增收二成的户，实际上这户社员比去年还减少一成多。

    少算今年开支
    中共河北省河间县委在领导农业社制定秋收分配方案工作中，为了显示农业社的优越性，把社员投进社里的肥料不计算在开支数内。这样就相对的显出开支少，收益多，扣留比数合乎原则，社员分的东西多。实际不然，拿留古寺火焰农业社来说吧，这个社总收入三十七万多元，扣留十二万多元，占总收入的33.7％，但社员投入肥料的价值四万多元，占总收入的11％，却未计算在开支数内，若加上这项开支就占总收入的44.7％了。由此可见花钱本来不少，但硬说开支不多，以显示收益多，社员增加收入。试想，这能叫做优越性吗？当然不是。我希望还是以实事求是的精神，对待这个问题，增产就是增产、减产就来检查原因，接受教训，不要弄虚作假。　段明鉴
