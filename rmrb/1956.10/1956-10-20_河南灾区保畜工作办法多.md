    Henan Disaster Areas Have Many Methods for Livestock Protection
    Lujiang
    Ensuring the safe overwintering of livestock is a top priority for disaster areas. Henan's disaster areas have found many livestock protection methods.
    After the Xin'yang region suffered a disaster, the disaster areas had more than 426,000 head of livestock, with a shortage of 530 million jin of grass. After vigorously mobilizing the masses to cut and store green grass, more than 2,200 agricultural cooperatives in 10 counties, including Huai'bin, Xi'xian, and Zheng'yang, have now cut more than 250 million jin of grass and stored more than 5 million jin of dry grass. The counties in the An'yang region that suffered from flooding all attached great importance to cutting grass and storing green grass. In Jun'xian county, more than a thousand people a day go to Lin'xian county to cut grass. In Tang'yin county, the Qinpinzhuang Worker-Peasant Alliance Second Agricultural Cooperative launched a grass-cutting competition, and just 410 women cut more than 100,000 jin of grass. In addition to cutting green grass, the disaster-stricken counties in the Xin'xiang region also adopted methods such as collecting wild vegetables and tree leaves and storing corn stalks. The Danying Agricultural Cooperative in Wen'xian county's Yellow River滩 area, because they started early, changed from a grass-deficient cooperative to a grass-surplus cooperative. The Shang'qiu region specially trained nearly a million people skilled in grass storage techniques.
    Mobilizing non-disaster areas to vigorously support disaster areas has also solved some of the grass shortage difficulties in disaster areas. The four disaster-stricken agricultural cooperatives in Cheng'guan, Jun'xian county, were short 2.66 million jin of grass and signed pre-purchase contracts for 2.75 million jin of fodder with six agricultural cooperatives that were not affected by the disaster, completely solving the grass shortage problem. In order to do a good job in fodder allocation, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have established fodder purchasing stations to actively purchase fodder. At the same time, disaster areas have also transferred many livestock to non-disaster areas for foster care. According to signed contracts and agreements, Nei'huang county transferred more than 4,500 head of livestock from grass-deficient or no-grass cooperatives to cooperatives with grass for foster care.
    Exchanging coal for grass is a way to save fodder. The Wei'shi county supply and marketing cooperative stipulates that one jin of coal can be exchanged for one jin of dry grass, so that the saved grass can be supplied to agricultural cooperatives with grass shortages. Now 20 townships and supply and marketing cooperatives have signed grass-coal exchange contracts, exchanging 3.2 million jin of dry grass. After the Guangmang Wanzhang Agricultural Cooperative in Nei'huang county implemented the method of exchanging coal for grass, many members who originally burned grass exchanged grass for coal and switched to burning coal, with one production team saving tens of thousands of jin of green grass.
    In order to help livestock survive the cold winter, disaster areas are now building and restoring livestock sheds. In Nei'huang county alone, more than a thousand livestock sheds have been repaired, and more than 280 new sheds have been built, accommodating more than 10,000 head of livestock, basically enabling the original disaster-stricken livestock to survive the harsh winter.

    河南灾区保畜工作办法多
    鲁江
    保证牲畜安全过冬，是灾区的一项头等重要的任务。河南灾区找出了许多保畜办法。
    信阳专区遭灾后，灾区有四十二万六千多头牲畜，缺草五亿三千万斤。经过大力发动群众割草、贮青，现在淮滨、息县、正阳等十县二千二百多个农业社已经割草二亿五千多万斤，贮干草五百多万斤。安阳专区受涝各县对于割草和贮青工作都很重视。浚县每日有千人以上到林县去割草。汤阴县秦品庄工农联盟第二农业社开展割草竞赛，仅四百一十个妇女就割草十多万斤。新乡专区各受灾县除割青草外还采取采集野菜，树叶和收贮玉米杆的办法。温县黄河滩单营农业社因动手早，由缺草社变成了余草社。商丘专区专门训练了近百万个会贮草技术的人员。
    发动非灾区大力支援灾区，也解决了灾区的部分缺草困难。浚县城关四个受灾的农业社缺草二百六十六万斤，跟六个没有受灾的农业社订立二百七十五万斤预购饲草合同，全部解决了缺草问题。为了做好草料调剂工作，各地供销社都已成立了草料收购站，积极收购草料。与此同时，灾区还移出许多牲畜到非灾区寄养。内黄县根据签订的合同、协议，从无草缺草社向有草社迁移寄养的牲畜达四千五百多头。
    以煤换草，是节约饲草的一个办法。尉氏县供销社规定一斤煤换一斤干草，以便把节省下来的草供应给缺草的农业社。现在已有二十个乡和供销社订了草煤互换合同，换出干草三百二十万斤。内黄县光芒万丈农业社实行以煤换草办法后，许多原来烧草的社员，都以草换煤，改烧煤炭，其中一个生产队就节省了青草成万斤。
    为了使牲畜渡过寒冬，现在灾区正在修建、恢复牲畜棚圈，仅内黄县已经重修牲畜棚屋就有一千多个，新建的棚房有二百八十多间，先后安置的牲畜有一万多头，使原来受灾的牲畜基本上能渡过严冬。
