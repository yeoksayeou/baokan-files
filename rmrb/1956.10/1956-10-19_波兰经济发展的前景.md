    Prospects for Economic Development in Poland
    Chen Youwei

    Recently, in Poland, in-depth research and discussions have been conducted on the development of the national economy over the past few years. The two resolutions passed by the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party not long ago – “On the Political and Economic Situation of the Country and the Tasks of the Party” and “On the Results of the Implementation of the Six-Year Plan and the Basic Guidelines of the Five-Year Plan for 1956-1960” – made objective analyses and realistic assessments of Poland's economic achievements and problems, and also made important decisions on the future development direction and specific steps of the Polish economy. The draft Polish Five-Year Plan released by the Polish Council of Ministers in early October was formulated based on the spirit of these resolutions.

    Poland's Six-Year Plan (1950-1955) began to be implemented after the recovery of the Polish national economy. The goals set by this plan greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the Polish working people to build their country. Over the past six years, the Polish people, with the world-renowned "Warsaw speed," have changed the face of their homeland and left behind the long-stagnant and backward economic level of pre-war Poland. During the Six-Year Plan, Poland built a total of 12,000 industrial enterprises of various sizes, and established many new and important industrial sectors such as automobiles, shipbuilding, optical and precision instruments, and man-made fibers. Poland's industrial production increased by more than 170% during the Six-Year Plan, reaching 4.8 times the pre-war level. This rate of development not only greatly exceeded the United States, France, and West Germany, but also exceeded the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. As a result of the rapid development of industry, the distance between Poland and advanced European capitalist industrial countries in terms of production level has been shortened. The most telling example is that before the war, Poland's industrial output was only half that of Sweden or two-thirds that of Belgium, but now it has caught up with Italy, one of the major capitalist industrial countries in Europe. The strengthening of economic power has greatly consolidated Poland's national independence and raised its international status to an unprecedented level. Today's Poland has become one of the important countries in Europe, both economically and politically. This is in stark contrast to the situation of pre-war Poland under bourgeois rule, which was weak and allowed imperialism to control it. Needless to say, without Poland's national liberation and without replacing the corrupt and backward capitalist system with an advanced socialist system through social revolution, all these achievements of Poland would have been impossible to achieve.

    The achievements made by Poland in the past six years are enormous. However, the Seventh Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party, while summarizing these achievements, also pointed out: "During the Six-Year Plan, on the one hand, objective difficulties were encountered, and on the other hand, some serious mistakes were also made." This situation has led to some imbalances in Poland's economic development, specifically manifested in: the advancement of industry and the backwardness of agriculture, the growth of industrial productivity and the insufficient supply of raw materials, and the rapid economic development and the slow improvement of people's living standards. According to materials published by Poland, during the Six-Year Plan, Poland's total industrial output, especially the output of heavy industry, has generally exceeded the original planned targets, but the plans for certain industrial sectors, such as coal, electricity, agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, building materials, cotton textiles, and sugar, have not been completed. Due to the failure to ensure a regular and sufficient supply of raw materials, some industrial enterprises have suspended production waiting for materials and have not been able to carry out production rhythmically, thus failing to fully utilize production equipment. At the same time, there is also a trend of increasing waste and declining quality in industrial production, which has had an adverse impact on reducing costs and meeting the needs of the people. In agriculture, the plan to increase agricultural production (including total output and unit area yield of crops) has not been completed. The original plan was to increase the total agricultural output value by 50%, but in reality, it only increased by 19%, of which the increase in grain production was less than 10%. In the past five years, Poland's average annual grain output has been about 12 million tons. Calculated per capita, this amount is much less than that of the Soviet Union or Romania. Therefore, Poland has to spend considerable foreign exchange to import more than one million tons of grain every year. The Six-Year Plan originally stipulated that the actual income of urban and rural residents should be increased by 50%-60%. However, according to a recent survey by a special committee set up by the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, the actual wages of employees have only increased by 13% in six years. The Seventh Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party said in this regard: "The situation of a large part of the working people has not changed, and the situation of some parts has even deteriorated."

    The causes of these difficulties and problems in the Polish economy are multifaceted. The Polish Party and government have recently repeatedly analyzed and explained the objective and subjective aspects of these causes. Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, pointed out when talking about this issue: "Among the reasons that are beyond our control, the development of the international situation should be considered first." The fact is that not long after the start of Poland's Six-Year Plan, the international situation became extremely tense due to the outbreak of the Korean War. Imperialism not only attempted to expand military adventures in the East, but also intensified the re-militarization of Germany in the West. Warmongers in the United States and West Germany openly listed the re-revision of the German-Polish border as one of their goals. "Due to these threats, we had to strengthen our country's defense potential, spend a lot of money on building the defense industry, and transfer our best workers and machines to that area" (Gomułka). The necessity of this effort is beyond doubt. Otherwise, in the face of a dangerous situation, Poland would be in a disadvantageous position where it would be unable to cope with sudden events. However, due to the expansion of the defense industry, it could not but correspondingly affect the development of other economic sectors, deepen economic imbalances, and hinder the further improvement of people's living standards.

    At the same time, when considering objective reasons, one cannot ignore the fact that the imbalance of economic development was originally a consequence of the economic development of pre-war capitalist Poland, and it was deepened by the severe losses suffered by Poland during the war.

    In addition, there are some problems in Poland's economic policies, mainly excessive accumulation and high planning targets. The resolution of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party pointed out: "The instructions in the Six-Year Plan regarding investment, especially industrial investment, exceeded the limit of funds available to complete this task, so these instructions were unrealistic." In the first four years of the Six-Year Plan, the proportion of Poland's national income used for accumulation was as high as 25% to more than 28% per year. It was not until 1954 that it dropped to about 21%. Most of these accumulations were used for industrial investment, and the focus of industrial investment was not prominent enough, and at the same time, more emphasis was placed on building new large-scale industrial enterprises, ignoring the full utilization of the production potential of existing factories. Due to the dispersion of investment, funds could not be turned around quickly and produce results early. Therefore, although many new factories were built in the past six years, according to the resolution of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party, the main increase in industrial production during the "Six-Year Plan was obtained in old factories."

    The backwardness of agriculture is a major weakness in Poland's Six-Year Plan. In addition to unfavorable climatic conditions and consecutive years of poor harvests, there are also some man-made factors. Gomułka said: "The rate of increase in agricultural production that we stipulated in the plan was too high and unrealistic. Moreover, we neglected agriculture, which should have received more help than we actually gave it." With the increasing needs of the national economy and the people for grain and livestock, the sown area of grain and feed crops has decreased by a quarter—3 million hectares—compared with the pre-war period. At the same time, due to the insufficient supply of means of production and means of livelihood to farmers by industry, and insufficient emphasis on the principle of material incentives, farmers' interest in expanding production and selling agricultural products has been reduced. The lower-level cadres in rural areas, when implementing the Party's class line in rural areas, often mistakenly regarded middle peasants as rich peasants to restrict them, and there was also a tendency to implement the policy of restricting rich peasants as eliminating rich peasants. This situation is also one of the important reasons for the slow progress of agricultural production and agricultural cooperativization in Poland.

    In terms of handicrafts, more emphasis was placed on the negative aspects of capitalist factors that may be generated by small producers, while insufficient attention was paid to the fact that they are also self-reliant laborers and therefore have the possibility of organizing them to take the socialist road. In practice, there have been deviations in which private handicrafts were regarded as "dangerous forms of capitalism" and handicraftsmen were regarded as "representatives of hostile class figures." Due to restrictions in tax policies, raw materials, and markets, Poland's handicrafts did not develop during the Six-Year Plan. This has also had adverse consequences for the economic life of the people.

    It should be pointed out that during the implementation of the Six-Year Plan, especially after the second half of 1953, the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party discovered some problems in Poland's economic development and took some measures to address them. However, due to the lack of significant easing of the international situation at that time, as well as other reasons, the phenomenon of unbalanced economic development in Poland has not been significantly overcome. Therefore, for a considerable period of time, the Polish economy was still in a rather tense situation.

    Now, the necessity and possibility of solving these problems in Poland's economic development are more mature than before. In recent months, the Polish Party and government have taken many urgent measures to improve people's welfare. The purpose of the published draft of the Polish Five-Year Plan is to fundamentally improve Poland's economic situation in the next five years, ensure the balanced development of various sectors, so as to improve the people's living standards as much as possible on the basis of comprehensive development of production. In the five years from 1956 to 1960, without changing the policy of prioritizing the growth of production of means of production, Poland will reduce the speed of industrial development, adjust the ratio of accumulation to consumption, and the distribution of investment in economic construction. The accumulation part of the Five-Year Plan will be lower than 20%, and the ratio of industrial and agricultural investment will also be changed from the ratio of approximately six to one during the Six-Year Plan to four to one. Industrial investment will focus on expanding and renovating existing factories and completing new industrial enterprises that have already been started. Industrial production will increase by more than half in five years. The development of agriculture will receive special attention. The supply of agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers will be increased, the feed base will be expanded, the cooperativization part of agriculture will be increased to more than a quarter, and at the same time, emphasis will be placed on utilizing the productivity of all individual farmers, including rich peasants. All this will increase agricultural production by 25% in five years. The development of handicrafts will be encouraged. In terms of improving people's living standards, the actual income of the working people will be increased by 30%, the supply of goods will be increased, the production of some defense industries will be transferred to civilian production, the prices of some daily necessities will be reduced, the allocation of social welfare undertakings will be increased, and more housing for the working people will be built. In order to ensure that all this can be smoothly realized, Poland will also implement some changes in the planning and management of the national economy, mainly to appropriately decentralize the powers of over-centralized central management agencies.

    The Polish Party and government believe that these tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan are realistic and feasible. In fact, Poland today has many favorable conditions internationally and domestically to complete its economic development tasks in the coming period. The easing of the international situation and the reduction of the war crisis have made it possible for Poland to reduce its armed forces (95,000 have already been reduced) and reduce defense expenditures. Strengthening ties and cooperation with the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries in the economy will provide Poland with a lot of convenience and assistance in terms of raw material supply, product sales, and daily necessities supply. After a large number of industrial enterprises built during the Six-Year Plan are put into production in the short term, the supply of industrial products will be greatly increased. Due to the implementation of the principle of material incentives, the initiative and enthusiasm of the working people will be brought into play, and this is the most important factor in overcoming any difficulties and creating all achievements.

    The schadenfreude imperialists have recently used some of the difficult situations in the Polish economy to slander and smear people's Poland, and have attempted to deepen these difficulties by various despicable means. In the Poznań Incident that occurred not long ago, this conspiracy of imperialism was displayed to the most rampant degree. But they rejoiced a little too early. The shortcomings arising in Poland's economic construction cannot hide the brilliant achievements made by the Polish people in the post-war years. Only simple-minded people will regard the cause of building socialism as a smooth and easy cause. The theory and practice of Eastern European people's democracy have only been around for more than a decade. It is not surprising that some shortcomings and difficulties appear in such a short period of time while making achievements. And, most importantly, any shortcomings will be gradually overcome, and are actually being rapidly overcome. The reason why the socialist system is far superior to the capitalist system is not only because it opens up a broad road for the development of productive forces, but also because it contains the possibility of overcoming all the difficulties encountered on its way forward and developing smoothly. There is no doubt that under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish government, the Polish people will make greater efforts on the road to building socialism. The completion of Poland's Five-Year Plan and the further development of the national economy will make more contributions to strengthening the cause of peace and socialism.

    波兰经济发展的前景
    陈有为
    最近一个时期以来，波兰国内曾对几年来波兰国民经济的发展情况进行了深入的研究和讨论。不久以前举行的波兰统一工人党中央委员会第七次全体会议所通过的两个决议——“关于国家政治与经济情况和党的任务”以及“关于六年计划执行结果和“1956—1960年五年计划的基本方针”，更对波兰经济的成就和问题作出了客观的分析和现实的估计，同时也对波兰经济今后的发展方向和具体步骤作了重要的决定。10月初波兰部长会议发布的波兰五年计划草案，就是根据这些决议的精神而拟定的。
    波兰的六年计划（1950—1955年）是在波兰国民经济恢复以后开始执行的。这个计划所提出的目标曾经极大地鼓舞了波兰劳动人民奋发建设的热情。六年来，波兰人民以闻名世界的“华沙速度”改变了祖国的面貌，把战前波兰长期停滞的落后的经济水平远远地抛在后面。在过去六年内，波兰曾经兴建了大大小小共一万二千个工业企业，建立了汽车、造船、光学与精密仪器，人造纤维等许多新的重要的工业部门。波兰的工业生产在六年计划期间增长了170％以上，而达到战前水平的四点八倍。这种发展速度不但大大地超过了美国、法国和西德，而且也超过了苏联和捷克斯洛伐克。由于工业迅速发展的结果，波兰同欧洲先进的资本主义工业国生产水平的距离缩短了。最能说明这一点的是，战前波兰的工业生产量只等于瑞典的一半或比利时的三分之二，而现在它已赶上了欧洲主要的资本主义工业国之一意大利。经济力量的增强，使波兰的国家独立大为巩固，国际地位空前提高。今天的波兰无论在经济上或政治上都已成为欧洲重要的国家之一了。这和战前资产阶级统治下的波兰由于软弱而听任帝国主义宰割的情况成为十分鲜明的对照。不用说，如果没有波兰的民族解放，不通过社会革命的方式以先进的社会主义制度来代替腐朽落后的资本主义制度，波兰的这一切成就是决不可能获得的。
    波兰在过去六年内所取得的成就是巨大的。不过，波兰统一工人党七中全会在总结这些成就的同时，也指出：“在六年计划期间，一方面碰到了客观的困难，另一方面也犯了一些严重的错误。”这种情况使得波兰经济发展中出现了一些不平衡的现象，具体地表现在：工业的先进和农业的落后，工业生产力的增长和原材料的供应不足，经济的迅速发展和人民生活水平的缓慢提高。根据波兰所发表的材料来看，在六年计划期间，波兰的工业总生产量特别是重工业生产量已经整个地超过了计划原定的指标，但是某些工业部门的产品，如煤、电力、农业机器、化学肥料、建筑材料、棉织品和食糖的计划则未完成。由于原材料的供应不能得到经常的和充分的保证，一些工业企业曾经停工待料、不能有节奏地进行生产，因而使生产设备没有得到充分的利用。同时，在工业生产中还有废品增多，质量下降的趋势，这对降低成本和满足人民需要发生了不利的影响。在农业方面，增加农业生产量（包括总产量和农作物的单位面积产量）的计划没有完成。原定农业总产值应增加50％，而实际上只增加了19％，其中谷物生产的增加还不到10％。在过去五年内，波兰的谷物平均年产量约为一千二百万吨左右。按人口平均计算，这个数量要比苏联或罗马尼亚的少得多。因此，波兰不得不耗费相当的外汇每年进口一百多万吨谷物。六年计划原规定要使城乡居民的实际收入提高50％—60％。但根据波兰统一工人党中央特设的一个专门委员会最近调查的结果，职工的实际工资在六年内只提高了13％。波兰统一工人党七中全会在谈到这一点时还说：“有很大一部分劳动人民的情况没有改变，甚至有些部分的情况反而变坏了。”
    造成波兰经济中的这些困难和问题的原因是多方面的。波兰党和政府最近曾屡次分析和解释了这些原因的客观和主观方面。波兰统一工人党第一书记奥哈布在谈到这个问题时指出：“在那些为我们的意志所不能左右的原因中，首先应当考虑到国际局势的发展。”事实是，波兰六年计划开始不久，国际局势就由于朝鲜战争的爆发而紧张到了极点。帝国主义不但企图在东方扩大军事冒险，同时也在西方加紧德国的重新军国主义化。美国和西德的好战分子公然把重新修改德波疆界列为他们的目标之一。“由于这些威胁，我们不得不加强我们国家的防御潜力，把大量经费用于建设国防工业，并且把我们最优秀的工人和机器转用于那方面”（奥哈布）。这种努力的必要性是无可怀疑的。否则，在险恶的局势面前，波兰将会处于无法应付突然事变的不利地位。但是由于国防工业的扩展，也就不能不相应地影响到其他经济部门的发展，加深经济的不平衡性和妨碍人民生活水平的进一步提高。
    同时，在考虑到客观原因的时候，也还不能忽略这样的事实：经济发展的不平衡性本来就是战前资本主义波兰经济发展的后果，而且它又由于波兰在战时遭受到的严重损失而加深了。
    除此以外，在波兰的经济政策上也有一些问题，主要是积累过多，计划偏高。波兰统一工人党七中全会的决议中指出：“六年计划中关于投资、特别是工业投资的指示，超过了可用来完成这方面任务的资金的限度，因此这些指示是不现实的。”六年计划的前四年内，波兰每年国民收入用于积累的部分高达25％到28％以上。直到1954年才下降到21％左右。这些积累大部分都用于工业投资，而工业投资的重点不够突出，同时又比较强调了建设新的大型工业企业，忽略了旧有工厂的生产潜力的充分利用。由于投资的分散，就不能很快地使资金得到周转，早日见效。因此，在过去六年内虽然兴建了不少新的工厂，但据波兰统一工人党七中全会的决议说，工业方面在“六年计划期间主要增产是在旧工厂中获得的。”
    农业的落后，是波兰六年计划中的一个主要弱点，这除了由于气候条件不利而曾连年歉收以外，也还存在着一些人为的因素。奥哈布说：“我们在计划中规定的农业生产提高速率偏高而不切实际。而且，我们忽略了农业，农业本来应该得到比我们实际给予的更多的帮助。”在国民经济和人民对于粮食和牲畜的需要日益增长的情况下，谷物和饲料的播种面积却比战前减少了四分之一——三百万公顷。同时，由于工业对农民生产资料和生活资料供应的不足，以及对物质鼓励原则的重视不够，使农民减少了扩大生产和出售农产品的兴趣。而农村下层干部在贯彻党在农村中的阶级路线时，又往往错误地把中农当作为富农来限制，并且还有把限制富农的政策执行为消灭富农的倾向。这种情况也是造成波兰农业生产和农业合作化进展缓慢的重要原因之一。
    在手工业方面，对于小生产者会产生资本主义因素的消极方面强调较多，而对于他们同时又是自食其力的劳动者因而有可能组织他们走上社会主义道路这一点则重视不够。在实际生活中曾经发生了把私人手工业当作“危险的资本主义形式”，把手工业者视为“代表敌对阶级人物”的偏向。由于在税收政策，原料和市场方面的限制，波兰的手工业在六年计划期间没有得到发展。这也对人民的经济生活产生了不利的后果。
    应该指出，在六年计划的执行过程中，特别是在1953年下半年以后，波兰统一工人党中央曾经发现了波兰经济发展中的一些问题，并为此而采取了一些措施。但是，由于那时国际局势并未得到显著的缓和，以及其他方面的原因，波兰经济发展不平衡的现象没有得到显著的克服。因此，在相当一段时期内，波兰的经济还是处在相当紧张的情况之中。
    现在，解决波兰经济发展中的这些问题的必要性和可能性已经比从前成熟了。最近几个月来，波兰党和政府已经采取了许多紧急措施来改善人民福利。已经发表的波兰五年计划草案的目的，就是要在今后五年内根本改进波兰的经济状况，保证各部门的平衡发展，以便在全面发展生产的基础上尽可能地提高人民的生活水平。1956年到1960年这五年内，在不改变生产资料生产优先增长的方针之下，波兰将减低工业发展的速度，调整积累与消费的比例和经济建设中的投资分配。五年计划的积累部分将低于20％，而工农业投资的比例也要从六年计划期间的大约六与一之比改变为四与一之比。工业方面的投资将着重于扩建和改建旧有的工厂企业和完成已经开建的新的工业企业。五年内工业生产量将增加一半多一些。农业的发展将受到特别的重视。农业机器和化学肥料的供应将要增加，饲料基地将要扩大，农业中的合作化部分将提高到四分之一以上，同时还要强调利用包括富农在内的全部个体农户的生产力。这一切将使农业生产在五年内提高25％。手工业的发展将得到鼓励。在改善人民的生活水平方面，将使劳动人民的实际收入增加30％，增加商品的供应，把一部分国防工业的生产转入民用生产，降低某些日用品的价格，增加社会福利事业的拨款，更多地兴建劳动人民的住宅。为了保证这一切得以顺利实现，波兰在国民经济的计划和管理方面也要实行一些改变，主要是适当地分散过分集中的中央管理机构的权力。
    波兰党和政府认为，五年计划中所规定的这些任务是切实可行的。事实上，波兰
  今天在国际和国内都有许多有利的条件来
  完成自己今后时期的经济发展任务。国际局势的缓和，战争危机的减退，使波兰有可能裁减自己的武装部队（已经裁减了九万五千名）和减少国防支出。在经济上加强同苏联和人民民主国家的联系和协作，将使波兰在原料供应、产品销售和日用品供应方面得到不少的便利和帮助。在六年计划期间兴建的大批工业企业于短期内投入生产以后，将大大地增加工业产品的供应。由于物质鼓励原则的实施，劳动人民的主动性和积极性将得到发挥，而这是克服任何困难和创造一切成就的最重要的因素。
    幸灾乐祸的帝国主义者最近曾经利用波兰经济的一些困难情况来对人民波兰进行诽谤诬蔑，并企图以各种卑劣的手段来加深这些困难。在不久以前发生的波兹南事件中，帝国主义的这种阴谋施展到了最嚣张的地步。但是他们高兴得太早了一点。波兰经济建设中所产生的一些缺点丝毫也掩盖不住波兰人民在战后年代里所取得的辉煌成就。只有头脑简单的人们才会把建设社会主义的事业看成是一帆风顺、轻而易举的事业。东欧人民民主的理论和实践一共才不过十多个年头。在这样短的时间内，在取得成就的同时出现一些缺点和困难并不是什么奇怪的事情。而且，最主要的是，任何缺点将会得到逐渐的克服，并且实际上已经在迅速克服中。社会主义制度之所以比资本主义制度优越得多，不仅是因为它为生产力的发展开辟了宽广的道路，而且它还包含着克服自己前进途中所遇到的一切困难而顺利发展的可能性。毫无疑问，在波兰统一工人党和波兰政府的领导之下，波兰人民将会在建设社会主义的道路上进行更大的努力。波兰五年计划的完成和国民经济的进一步发展，将会对加强和平与社会主义事业作出更多的贡献。
