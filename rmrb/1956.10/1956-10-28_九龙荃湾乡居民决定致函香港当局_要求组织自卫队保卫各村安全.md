Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 27th: According to a report by the Hong Kong "Times," the Tsuen Wan Rural Committee (composed of representatives elected from various villages in Tsuen Wan) in the Kowloon suburbs held a meeting on the 26th. After discussing the Tsuen Wan riots, the village representatives decided to write to the Hong Kong British authorities requesting permission for villagers to organize self-defense forces to protect the safety of the villages. They also requested that in the event of similar incidents in the future, the Hong Kong British authorities should promptly dispatch military police to maintain law and order.

Ten local figures and village representatives from Tsuen Wan jointly submitted a document proposing the following three points: "1. When the military police authorities searched for rioters in the Tsuen Wan area on the afternoon of the 14th of this month, they ordered residents of Haiba Village, Kwan Mun Hau Village, Ho Back Village, Yang Uk Village, and Sam Tung Uk Village in the urban area of Castle Peak Road, regardless of whether they were innocent, or even the elderly and infirm, to raise their arms in the street for more than two hours. This method of searching for rioters by the military police authorities is unfair. They treat ordinary innocent residents as if they were rioters, while not conducting searches and encirclements in mountainous and wooded areas, focusing only on prosperous urban residential areas. This move is puzzling, and residents of this area are extremely dissatisfied with the government's measures following this incident. "2. We are extremely dissatisfied with the unfriendly cooperation measures taken by the authorities towards the standing committee members and village representatives of this committee. We feel that we only have obligations and no rights whatsoever. In order to consolidate credibility and facilitate future work, this committee should negotiate with the relevant authorities. "3. In order to facilitate the work of village representatives in the local area, the Director of Home Affairs should immediately issue identity certificates to village representatives and approve the organization of village self-defense forces to assist in maintaining law and order."

    九龙荃湾乡居民决定致函香港当局
    要求组织自卫队保卫各村安全
    据新华社广州27日电　据香港“时代社”报道，九龙郊区的荃湾乡事委员会（由荃湾各乡村选出的代表组成）26日召开会议，各村代表对荃湾大暴乱作了讨论以后，决定致函香港英国当局，要求允许乡民组织自卫队，保卫各村的安全，并在以后同样事件发生时，香港英国当局应迅速派军警维持治安。
    荃湾地方人士和村代表共十人联名具文提出了如下三点意见：一、军警当局于本月14日下午三时在荃湾区搜捕暴徒时，将市区青山道海坝村、关门口村、河背村、杨屋村和三栋屋村等之居民，不分善良，甚至老弱病者之男性，均一律着令举手臂在街上达两句余鐘之久。军警当局此等搜捕暴徒办法，殊不公允，对一般善良居民，则视同暴物，而山林木屑之地区，则未有举行搜索围捕，只向繁荣市区住宅着手，此举殊令人费解，此次事件发生，本区居民对政府之措施异常不满。“二、此次当局对本会常务委员及各村代表之不友好合作措施，吾人非常不满，感到只有义务，而绝无权利可言，为巩固信誉及方便今后工作起见，本会应向有关当局交涉。“三、为方便各村代表在地方工作，应即请民政署长发给村代表身份证明书及准组织各村自卫队，协助维持治安。”
