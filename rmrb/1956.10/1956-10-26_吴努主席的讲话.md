Chairman U Nu's Speech

My good friend Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice-Chairman Zhu De, and friends:

First of all, I would like to express my special gratitude to you all for the reception you have given us upon our arrival here. What makes us even happier and more grateful is that, on this visit, you have welcomed us not only as friends but as relatives. This is my third visit to China. I particularly hope that, in this age of airplanes, there will be more opportunities to visit China in the future. Looking back at the history of our two countries, in the past, it took Burmese representatives ten or twenty years to visit China once, and Chinese representatives also took ten or twenty years to visit Burma once. Now, in this age of airplanes, Chinese representatives can visit Burma once a month, and Burmese representatives can also visit China once a month. This is my third visit to China, and my good friend Premier Zhou Enlai will visit our country in December for the third time as well.

I have a belief, which is that I believe that frequent contact between leaders is better than correspondence in enhancing the friendship between our two countries. Therefore, I particularly believe that leaders such as premiers, presidents, vice-presidents, ministers, politicians, and cultural figures, like us, should visit each other, which will make the edifice of Sino-Burmese friendship that my good friend Premier Zhou Enlai and we so desire even more solid and magnificent. Peaceful coexistence may be a temporary disguise and a tactical means for other countries. However, for our country and the People's Republic of China, peaceful coexistence is by no means a temporary disguise. Peaceful coexistence must be actively realized by the leaders and peoples of our two countries. Other countries are separated by a thousand, two thousand, or three thousand miles, while the People's Republic of China and our country are territorially adjacent. These two countries cannot be separated. The People's Republic of China cannot be separated from Burma. Similarly, we Burmese cannot be separated from the People's Republic of China. For these two inseparable countries, if we do not establish mutual friendship and practice peaceful coexistence, then what is to be done? The People's Republic of China is many times larger than Burma, whether in terms of land area, population, mineral resources, or culture. But for us, although China is so big, what we hope to get from China is not aid, but friendship. That would satisfy us. I would like to declare here to everyone that since we have come into contact with the Chinese leaders, we have gained a lot of the friendship we hoped for. I would particularly like to mention that we are likely to encounter some difficulties in building the Sino-Burmese friendship edifice. Premier Zhou Enlai just mentioned this as well. He said that we may encounter some difficulties in building the Sino-Burmese friendship edifice. In fact, that is the case. Not to mention encountering difficulties in building the friendship edifice of the two countries, we will encounter difficulties even in constructing a building. For example, in constructing a building, we will encounter difficulties in finding materials, architects, engineers, and workers. But after we patiently overcome these difficulties, we will build a magnificent building. I know that since we will encounter some difficulties in constructing a building, we will also encounter many difficulties in building the Sino-Burmese friendship edifice. When encountering these difficulties, I often think of my good friend Premier Zhou Enlai, because he is always very patient when encountering difficulties. Therefore, whether we encounter difficulties, or whether we are impatient, or whether we want to act rashly, I think of my good friend Premier Zhou Enlai. I had the opportunity to observe Premier Zhou Enlai closely at the Bandung Conference. As you all know, so many people attended this conference, and the opinions were so divided. Although I cannot say that if my good friend Premier Zhou Enlai had not been patient at the meeting, the meeting would have failed, but I can say that the meeting would not have been so successful. Therefore, I suggest that we all drink to the health of my dear friend Premier Zhou Enlai, who is indispensable in building the Sino-Burmese friendship edifice! To the health of Chairman Mao Zedong and other leaders of the great Chinese people! Let us raise our glasses to the longevity of Afro-Asian peace! To the longevity of world peace!

### 吴努主席的讲话

    吴努主席的讲话我的好朋友周恩来总理、朱德副主席和各位朋友：
    首先，我对各位对我们到达这里给予如此的招待表示特别感谢。更使我们感到高兴和感谢的是，当我到这里访问时，诸位不仅朋友般地而且亲戚般地欢迎我们。我这次访问中国已经是第三次了。我特别希望，在这个飞机的时代，在将来能够有更多的机会来访问中国。翻开我们两国的历史来看，过去缅甸代表十年或者二十年才能到中国访问一次，中国代表也是十年或者二十年才能到缅甸访问一次。现在，在这个飞机时代里，中国代表可以每月访问缅甸一次。而缅甸代表也可以每月访问中国一次了。这次我访问中国已经是第三次了。而我的好朋友周恩来总理在12月间访问我国，也将是第三次了。
    我有一个信念，那就是，我相信：在增进两国友谊方面，领导人员之间的经常接触胜过于书信来往。因此，我特别相信：总理、总统、副总统、部长、政治家以及文化界负责人等领导人员像我们一样，进行互相访问，将使我的好朋友周恩来总理和我们所渴望的中缅友谊大厦更加巩固和壮丽。和平共处，对于别的国家来说，也许是一时的伪装和策略的手段。但是，对于我国和中华人民共和国来说，和平共处绝不是一时的伪装。和平共处是要由我们两国的领导人员和人民来积极实现的。其他国家相互之间相隔一千哩、二千哩或三千哩，而中华人民共和国和我国却是领土毗邻。这两个国家是不能分离的。中华人民共和国不能同缅甸分离。同样的，我们缅甸也不能同中华人民共和国分离。对于这两个不能分离的国家来说，如果不建立相互间的友谊，不实行和平共处，那么，将有什么可做的呢？中华人民共和国比缅甸大好几倍。不论是在土地面积、人口、矿产资源或者文化方面来说，都比缅甸大好几倍。但是，对我们来说，中国尽管是那么大，然而我们希望从中国得到的不是援助，而是友谊。这样我们就满意了。我想在这里向各位表白：自从我们同中国领导人员接触以来，我们已经得到了很多我们所希望得到的友情。我想特别提到的是：在我们建立中缅友好大厦的时候，很可能遇到一些困难。刚才周恩来总理也谈到了这点。他说，在我们建立中缅友好大厦的时候，可能碰到一些困难。事实上也是那样，不要说在建立两国友好大厦的时候会碰到困难，就是在建筑楼房的时候也会碰到困难。例如，在建筑楼房时，就会碰到寻找材料、建筑师、工程师和工人的困难。但是，在我们耐心地克服了这些困难以后，我们将建筑成一座华丽的楼房。我知道：既然在建筑楼房时会遇到一些困难，那么，在建筑中缅友好大厦时也会遇到不少困难。在碰到这些困难时，我常常想起我的好朋友周恩来总理，因为他在碰到困难时，总是非常耐心的。因此，在我们碰到困难的时候也好，在我们不耐心的时候也好，在我们想蛮干的时候也好，我就想起了我的好朋友周恩来总理。我获得机会来仔细观察周恩来总理的地方是在万隆会议上。各位都知道，出席这次会议的人是那么多，而意见又是那么分歧。虽然我不能说，如果我的好朋友周恩来总理在会议上不耐心，会议就会失败，但是，我可以说，会议是不会那么圆满成功的。因此，我建议我们大家为在建立中缅友好大厦中必不可少的我的亲爱的朋友周恩来总理的健康干杯！为中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席和其他领导人员的健康干杯！让我们举杯祝亚非和平万岁！祝世界和平万岁！
