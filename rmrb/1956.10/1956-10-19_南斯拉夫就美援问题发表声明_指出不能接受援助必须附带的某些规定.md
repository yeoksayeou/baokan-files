Xinhua News Agency, 18th: According to a report by the Yugoslav News Agency, the representative of the Yugoslav State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs read out a statement at a special press conference in Belgrade on the 17th regarding President Eisenhower's report to the two houses of Congress on the issue of US aid to Yugoslavia.

The statement said:

We would like to point out the following based on the initial impressions we have gained from President Eisenhower's statement in his letter to the US Congress:

First, we value President Eisenhower's efforts, as expressed in his letter to the US Congress, to strive for continued aid to Yugoslavia. However, we are unclear as to why certain provisions must be attached, some of which are unacceptable.

Second, President Eisenhower's statement first indicates that a portion of the economic aid is not for a fixed term and can be modified at any time. This creates a very unreliable situation, as it is possible to delay or cancel this aid at any time under certain circumstances.

Third, the report states that the purpose of providing aid is to enable Yugoslavia to maintain its independence. We believe that there is no threat to Yugoslavia's independence on the part of the Soviet Union.

We still adhere to our principle in our foreign policy of cooperating with all countries on an equal basis. Unfortunately, some of the content of the report does not conform to the principle of independent and equal cooperation.

Fourth, the aid that Yugoslavia has received so far has been of great value, and we are grateful for this aid. We have repeatedly stated this, and we have also emphasized that this aid is not attached to any political conditions.

However, due to the increasing discussions and studies on the issue of aid to Yugoslavia in the American newspapers and among some Americans, our people have a deep impression. Therefore, the Yugoslav government suggests that the US government adopt new methods of economic cooperation, so that Yugoslavia can use long-term loans to purchase surplus US agricultural products and repay them with US dollars or other corresponding currencies. The Yugoslav government believes that this method is more in line with the interests of both Yugoslavia and the United States, and adopting this method will make it possible to further promote cooperation and understanding between our two countries.

This will avoid certain comments that do not contribute to mutual trust and friendship.

Fifth, regarding military assistance, this assistance has almost stopped this year except for the delivery of some parts. We are very concerned about the delivery of items agreed upon earlier, especially the delivery of jet engines and other heavy weapons.

We have noted that the US government is encountering difficulties precisely on the issue of military assistance. Therefore, we have reminded the US government that if it finds it difficult to continue this assistance, then we are unwilling to create difficulties in this regard. We have also stated that stopping military assistance will not affect our good relations in the future.

    南斯拉夫就美援问题发表声明
    指出不能接受援助必须附带的某些规定
    新华社18日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社报道，南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处的代表17日在贝尔格莱德举行的特别记者招待会上宣读了关于美国总统艾森豪威尔就美国援助南斯拉夫问题向国会两院议长所提出的报告的声明。
    声明说：
    我们愿意根据从艾森豪威尔总统的声明中所获得的初步印象指出以下几点：
    一、我们重视艾森豪威尔总统在他写给美国国会的信件中表明的他为了争取继续援助南斯拉夫而进行的努力。但是，我们不清楚为什么必须附带某些规定，这些规定中有一些甚至是不可接受的。
    二、艾森豪威尔总统的声明首先表明，一部分经济援助是没有一定期限的，这种援助随时可以修改。这样就造成了十分不可靠的情况，因为随时有可能在某种情况下延迟或者撤销这种援助。
    三、报告中说，给予援助的目的在于使南斯拉夫有能力维持自己的独立。我们认为，在苏联那一方面，并不存在对于南斯拉夫的独立的威胁。
    我们仍然坚持我们的外交政策中的在平等的基础上同一切国家合作的原则。不幸，报告中的某些内容却是不符合独立平等的合作的原则的。
    四、南斯拉夫到目前为止所接受的援助是有很大价值的，我们感谢这种援助。我们曾经屡次说明这一点，同时也着重地指明，这种援助是不附有任何政治条件的。
    但是，由于美国报纸和美国某些人士对于援助南斯拉夫问题正在进行越来越多的讨论和研究，结果使我国人民有了很深的印象，因此，南斯拉夫政府建议美国政府采取新的经济合作方法，使南斯拉夫利用长期的贷款购买美国的剩余农产品，而以美元或者其他相应的货币偿还。南斯拉夫政府认为，这种方法是更加符合南斯拉夫和美国的利益的，采用了这种方法就会有可能进一步促进我们两国之间的合作和谅解。
    这样就会避免某些无助于相互间的信任和友谊的评论了。
    五、关于军事援助，本年内除了运来一些零件以外，这种援助已经几乎停止。我们十分关心早先商妥的物品交货，特别是喷气引擎和其他重型武器的交货。
    我们注意到，美国政府正是在军事援助问题上遭遇了困难，因此我们曾经提醒美国政府，如果它认为继续这种援助有困难，那末我们是不愿意在这一方面制造困难的，而我们还曾表示，停止军事援助是不会影响今后我们的良好关系的。
