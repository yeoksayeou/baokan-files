    Twenty Years of Time, Three Thousand Li Journey
    ——Xu Guangping and Haiying Commemorate the Twentieth Anniversary of Lu Xun's Death
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Shen Ding

    I. On the Journey South
    Thirty years ago, Mr. Lu Xun left Beijing and traveled south along the Jinpu Railway, passing through Nanjing to Shanghai, accompanied by a young woman. From the following year – 1927 – until the end, Lu Xun lived and fought alongside that woman.
    She was Lu Xun's wife and comrade-in-arms – Xu Guangping.
    A long time has passed. On October 8th this year, I met her on a train from Beijing to Shanghai. Leaving aside old stories from thirty years ago, I only asked her to talk about her life in the twenty years since Lu Xun's passing.
    Xu Guangping leaned against the train window, lost in thought, a few strands of white hair on her head glinting silver in the sunlight. She began to answer my request.
    From Lu Xun's death in 1936 to 1948, they lived in Shanghai. Under the long-term leadership of the Chinese Communist Party's underground organization, she engaged in cultural and women's work. Her son, Haiying, who was only eight or nine years old, often followed his mother, going everywhere.
    Speaking of this, Xu Guangping cast a mother's special, loving gaze towards Haiying, who was listening to her attentively.
    In those times – under the rule of the Kuomintang and the Japanese invaders – Lu Xun's works had essentially become banned books. Xu Guangping consistently participated in the editing, publishing, and distribution of Lu Xun's posthumous works. The greatest joy was whenever one of his books reached a reader's hands. She often wrapped large bundles of Lu Xun's works and personally delivered them to bookstores far away. The reactionary rulers constantly subjected her to persecution. When the Japanese invaders occupied Shanghai, they even imprisoned her and tortured her for more than two months. In 1948, she finally took Haiying to the Northeast Liberated Area.
    After the nationwide liberation, people could see her movements in the newspapers from time to time. In an era that Lu Xun had longed for and fought his entire life to realize, Xu Guangping, in her fifties, worked selflessly and became an outstanding political activist. Haiying also grew up healthily. He now works in the Physics Department of Peking University and recently joined the Chinese Communist Party. He is also the father of two children.
    Before going to the Northeast in 1948, Xu Guangping and Haiying had secretly gone to Shaoxing to see the place that had nurtured Lu Xun and where he had spent almost a third of his life. At the same time, they were also there to bid it farewell.
    Today, as people across the country solemnly commemorate the twentieth anniversary of Lu Xun's death, his dearest – his wife, son, and daughter-in-law whom he never met – first thought of seeing the land where he was born again, despite the long journey.

    II. In Lu Xun's Hometown
    After several days and nights of travel, they finally completed the three thousand and several hundred li journey from Beijing to Shaoxing. The car carrying Xu Guangping and her party arrived in Lu Xun's hometown on October 10th. From the suburbs, you could see the tall chimneys of the factories that manufacture Shaoxing rice wine, spewing thick smoke. The fields along both sides of the road stretched as far as the eye could see, filled with half-ripe late rice, and the edges of the rice paddies were covered with duckweed. Even though it was deep autumn, the eye was filled with a mixture of yellow and green, a scene full of vitality. It was in stark contrast to the hometown that Lu Xun had written about as "lacking any vitality."
    Greeting them in the suburbs was Zhang Zhanggui, the grandson of "Runtu" and the son of "Shuisheng," characters depicted in Lu Xun's famous work "My Old Home". This enthusiastic young man led the car to Lu Xun Road, past the Lu Xun Kindergarten, and to the Lu Xun Memorial Hall. In this small city, there is also a primary school and a cinema named after Lu Xun.
    Xu Guangping once found a ledger among Lu Xun's belongings that recorded the furniture and sundries he had stored in his former residence when he moved to Beijing. In 1953, she gave this ledger to the Lu Xun Memorial Hall in Shaoxing.
    As soon as they met, curator Fang Jie told her that they had recovered nearly half of the furniture based on the ledger, essentially restoring the original state of the former residence. Disregarding her travel fatigue, she excitedly ran to the Xintai Gate former residence to visit. She and Haiying spent a long time in Lu Xun's mother's room, gazing at the old wooden bed, because it was said that Lu Xun was born on this bed. Next, they went to the "Sanwei Study," where Lu Xun went to school. His desk was placed in a dark corner, restored to its original condition. Xu Guangping turned on a flashlight and found a "早" (early) character carved by Lu Xun himself on the desk. The story goes that once Lu Xun was late for school and was reprimanded by his teacher, so he carved the "早" character to urge himself. From then on, he was never late again.
    When they entered Lu Xun's childhood paradise, the Hundred Herbs Garden, they first saw that the mud wall, which Lu Xun considered infinitely interesting, remained the same. Listening carefully, the oil beetles were still singing softly, and the crickets were still playing their instruments. Today, this land has become an extremely solemn place in the hearts of Shaoxing's youth and children, and they often hold ceremonies here to join the Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers.
    Xu Guangping also carefully visited the memorial hall. She paid particular attention to the homework and books from Lu Xun's student days, which had only recently been found. She, her son, and her daughter-in-law looked at each other and smiled in front of a glass cabinet. Because, here was an article written by Lu Xun under the pen name "Ling Fei" for the "Henan" magazine, and Haiying's eldest son is named "Ling Fei."
    The next morning, Xu Guangping and her party took a awning boat again, braving the autumn wind and rain, and travelled more than thirty li by water to Anqiaotou to visit the old residence of Lu Xun's maternal grandmother. Anqiaotou is the "Pingqiao Village" described by Lu Xun. He had befriended many rural children here, which served as a mirror for his later descriptions of rural life. Now, all the farmers in Anqiaotou have joined agricultural production cooperatives. When I talked with some old people about the tragic experiences of characters like "Xianglin's Wife" and "Runtu," it seemed like they were telling ancient stories.
    In order to attend the reburial ceremony in Shanghai on the 14th, Xu Guangping and her party prepared to leave again with infinite reluctance.
    Before leaving, Haiying took a picture of Zhang Zhanggui. As they walked side by side, arm in arm, I couldn't help but think of Lu Xun's words: "They should have new lives, lives that we have never lived."
    Twenty-four-year-old Zhang Zhanggui was a cowherd for a landlord's family before liberation. Now, he is a member of the Communist Youth League and a capable staff member of the memorial hall. Their friendship – the fighting friendship between Haiying, a communist party member, and Zhang Zhanggui, a communist youth league member, is truly as Lu Xun hoped, that no force will ever be able to separate them.
    Lu Xun's prediction has come true.

    III. At Lu Xun's Tomb
    On the morning of the 14th, the foot of Lu Xun's new tomb, built of simple granite, in Shanghai's Hongkou Park was filled with wreaths. Flowers emitted a sweet fragrance in the warm wind.
    The brass band played Chopin's "Funeral March."
    The hearse carrying Lu Xun's coffin came from the Wanguo Public Cemetery in western Shanghai to the entrance of Hongkou Park. Lu Xun's close comrades-in-arms, Song Qingling, Mao Dun, Xu Guangping, and others, supported Lu Xun's coffin and slowly proceeded to the new burial site in the park.
    The coffin was covered with a large flag with the words "National Soul" written on it. It was a replica of the flag that the people of Shanghai presented at Lu Xun's funeral twenty years ago. The original was black characters on a white background, but the replica was changed to a red flag, symbolizing victory.
    A gust of autumn wind rolled up a corner of the flag. Xu Guangping took off a colorful rhinestone brooch she was wearing on her chest and firmly fastened the flag. This brooch was a gift from the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee when she led a delegation from the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to the Soviet Union. As the coffin slowly descended into the tomb with the brooch, tears welled up in Xu Guangping's eyes. Mr. Song Qingling, who was next to her, gently held her arm, and Haiying also stood close to his mother, silently comforting her. But their eyes were also full of tears. Twenty years ago, at the time of the burial, the three of them were also leaning on each other, standing closely together, sharing this great grief. Such a scene, captured at that time, is still hanging in the Lu Xun Memorial Hall near the new tomb.
    Following Mao Dun and Ba Jin, Xu Guangping also delivered a speech at the tomb. Her voice was loud and firm.
    Twenty years ago, she once held the tomb inscription "To Lu Xun, the Master" in her hands, shedding tears, and participated in Lu Xun's funeral. The tomb inscription contained her dedication: ... ...
    You once said to me:
    "I am like a cow.
    I eat grass,
    And squeeze out milk, blood."
    You did not know what rest was,
    What entertainment was.
    Work, work!
    Holding a pen even on the day before your death.
    Now...
    I hope our masses,
    Persistently follow in your footsteps...
    The photo taken at that time still retains her sad and haggard face. Today, although her temples are gray, she is more full and healthier. For twenty years, she has always been worthy of the title of Lu Xun's comrade-in-arms, and together with the masses of the people, she has followed in Lu Xun's footsteps from the darkness to the dawn, and will go from the victory of today to the victory of tomorrow.
    After the burial ceremony, Xu Guangping and Haiying and his wife visited the Lu Xun Memorial Hall. Later, they returned to the tomb again, lingering and reluctant to leave.
    Near noon, the Lu Xun statue in front of the tomb was shrouded in the light of the sun, and looking up, it was dazzling. On the huge tombstone behind the statue, the six large characters "The Tomb of Mr. Lu Xun" are written horizontally, this is Chairman Mao Zedong's handwriting. The largest wreath at the bottom of the tombstone was presented by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with the words "Mr. Lu Xun Lives Forever" written on it.

### 二十年岁月，三千里行程——许广平和海婴在纪念鲁迅逝世二十周年的日子里

    二十年岁月，三千里行程
    ——许广平和海婴在纪念鲁迅逝世二十周年的日子里
    新华社记者　沈鼎
    一、南下途中
    三十年前，鲁迅先生离开北京，由津浦路南下，经南京，到上海，同行的是一位年轻的女郎。下一年——1927年起到最后，鲁迅一直和那位女郎在一起生活，也在一起战斗。
    她就是鲁迅的夫人和战友——许广平。
    漫长的岁月过去了。今年10月8日，记者在一列从北京到上海的火车上会见了她。且不说三十年前的旧话，只要求她谈谈永别鲁迅之后二十年来的生活。
    许广平靠着车窗沉思着，头上的几缕白发在阳光里闪着银光。她开始回答这个请求。
    从1936年鲁迅逝世到1948年，他们住上海。长期在中国共产党地下组织的领导下，作文化工作和妇女工作。才只有八、九岁的儿子海婴，也常跟着母亲到处奔走。
    谈到这里，许广平把母亲特有的慈爱的眼波投向正在一旁倾听她谈话的海婴。
    那些时候——国民党和日本侵略者统治的时候，鲁迅的作品实际上已经成为禁书，许广平始终参加着编辑、出版和发行鲁迅遗著的工作，只要有一本书能够到读者手里，就是最大的愉快。她常用包袱包了大包鲁迅著作，亲自把书送到很远的书店里去。反动统治者不断地对她施加着迫害，日本侵略者占领上海的时候，还把她关进监狱，把她折磨了两个多月。1948年，她才带着海婴去到东北解放区。
    全国解放以后，人们已经可以不时在报纸上看到她的行踪了。五十多岁的许广平在鲁迅所理想的、并且为了要使它实现而战斗一生的时代里忘我劳动，成为一个出色的政治活动家，海婴也健康地成长了。他现在北京大学物理系工作，不久前加入了中国共产党；而且已经是两个孩子的父亲了。
    1948年去东北之前，许广平和海婴曾经悄悄地去到绍兴，为的是看一看养育了鲁迅，而且几乎度过他一生中三分之一时间的地方。同时，也为了向它告别。
    今天，举国人民都在隆重地纪念鲁迅逝世二十周年的时候，作为他最亲爱的人——夫人、儿子和没有见过面的儿媳，首先想到的就是再去看一看他出生的土地，虽然路途遥远。
    二、在鲁迅故乡
    经过几昼夜旅途劳顿，终于赶完了从北京到绍兴的三千几百里路程。载着许广平一行的汽车10月10日来到了鲁迅故乡。在市郊远远就可以望见制造绍兴老酒的工厂的高烟囱正在喷着浓烟。公路两旁望不到边的田野里尽是半熟的晚稻，稻田边沿藕塘里满飘着浮萍。虽是深秋时分，也竟然满眼鹅黄嫩绿，一片生机。和鲁迅当年所写下“没有一些活气”的故乡，成了鲜明的对比。
    远迎到郊外来的是鲁迅故人，他的名作“故乡”里所描画的“闰土”的孙子、“水生”的儿子章张贵。这个热情的青年人引导着汽车来到鲁迅路，经过鲁迅幼儿园，到达鲁迅纪念馆。在这小小的城市里，还有一个小学和一个电影院也是以鲁迅命名的。
    许广平曾经在鲁迅遗物中找到一本鲁迅迁居北京时，寄存故居家具杂物的帐本。她在1953年把这帐本送给了绍兴的鲁迅纪念馆。
    馆长方杰一见面就告诉她，已经根据帐本找回了近一半家具，使故居基本上恢复原状。顾不得旅途疲劳，她兴奋地立刻跑到新台门故居去参观，她和海婴长时间地停留在鲁迅母亲的房间里，注视着那张古老的木床，因为据说鲁迅就诞生在这张床上。接着，又到鲁迅上学的地方“三味书屋”，他的书桌按照原状放在阴暗的一角。许广平亮起手电，在桌面上寻到了鲁迅亲手刻的一个“早”字。来历是这样：有一次，鲁迅上学迟到，受了老师的责备，他就刻下这“早”字，来督促自己。从此，他再也没有迟到过。
    当他们进入鲁迅幼年的乐土——百草园时，首先看到那座鲁迅认为有着无限趣味的泥墙依然如故，侧耳听去，油蛉仍然在低唱、蟋蟀仍然在弹琴。如今，这块土地已经成为绍兴青年和少年们心目中极为庄严的所在，他们常常在这里举行加入青年团的仪式和加入少年先锋队的仪式。
    许广平又仔细地参观了纪念馆。对纪念馆在不久前才找到的鲁迅读书时代的作业和书本，看得特别仔细。她在一个玻璃柜前和儿子、儿媳相视而笑。因为，这里正陈列着鲁迅以“令飞”的笔名给“河南”杂志写的文章，而海婴的大儿子就是以“令飞”为名字的。
    次日清晨，许广平一行又坐着乌篷船，冒着秋风秋雨，赶三十多里水路到安桥头去访问鲁迅外婆家的旧宅。安桥头就是鲁迅笔下的“平桥村”，他曾在这里和许多农村少年结交，成为后来描写农村生活的借镜。现在，安桥头所有的农民都已经加入了农业生产合作社。当记者和几位老人谈起“祥林嫂”、“闰土”这些人物悲惨的遭遇时，好像在讲古老的故事一样。
    为了要参加14日在上海举行的迁墓仪式，许广平一行怀着无限留恋的心情，又准备上路。
    临行之前，海婴给章张贵摄了一张相片。当他们亲密地挽手同行的时候，记者不由得想到鲁迅说过：“他们应该有新的生活，为我们所未经生活过的。”
    二十四岁的章张贵解放前还是地主人家的放牛娃，现在是一个青年团员、纪念馆里得力的工作人员。他们——海婴和章张贵，一个共产党员和一个青年团员的战斗的友谊，真如鲁迅所希望的，是永远不会有任何力量可以使他们隔膜起来的。
    鲁迅的预言，实现了。
    三、在鲁迅墓前
    14日清晨，上海虹口公园内用素净的花岗石砌成的鲁迅新墓脚下摆满了花环。鲜花在暖风里散发着清香。
    铜管乐队奏起了肖邦的“葬礼进行曲”。
    放着鲁迅灵柩的灵车从沪西万国公墓来到了虹口公园门口，鲁迅生前亲密的战友宋庆龄、茅盾、许广平等人，扶着鲁迅的灵柩缓缓地向公园内的新墓地进发。
    灵柩上复盖着写有“民族魂”三字的大旗。它是按照二十年前鲁迅先生安葬时上海民众献的旗子复制的。原来是白底黑字，复制时改成象征着胜利的红旗。
    一阵秋风，卷起了这面旗子的一角，许广平取下戴在胸前的一朵采色水钻扣花，把旗子牢牢扣住。这朵扣花是她在率领中华全国民主妇女联合会代表团前往苏联时苏联妇女反法西斯委员会赠送的礼品。当灵柩带着这朵扣花徐徐落入墓穴的时候，许广平泪珠滚出了眼眶，在她身边的宋庆龄先生轻轻地挽着她的臂膊，海婴也紧紧挨着母亲，他们默默地安慰着她。但是，他们的眼睛里也都充满着泪水。二十年前下葬的时候，他们三人也是这样偎依着，紧紧地站立在一起，分担着这巨大的悲痛。当年摄下的这样一个镜头，还挂在新墓附近的鲁迅纪念馆里。
    继茅盾、巴金之后，许广平也在墓前致词。她的声音嘹亮而且坚定。
    二十年前，她曾经手捧着“致鲁迅夫子”的墓偈，流着眼泪，参加鲁迅的葬仪。墓偈上写着她的献词：…………
    你曾对我说：
    “我好像一只牛。
    吃的是草，
    挤出的是牛奶，血。”
    你不晓得，什么是休息，
    什么是娱乐。
    工作，工作！
    死的前一日还在执笔。
    如今……
    希望我们大众，
    锲而不舍跟着你的足迹……。
    当年摄下的照片上还留着她悲痛憔悴的容颜。今天，她虽已两鬓斑白，但却愈加丰满，愈加健康。二十年来，她始终无愧于鲁迅战友的称号，和人民大众一起，踏着鲁迅的足迹从黑夜走到天明，又将从胜利的今天走向胜利的明天。
    在葬仪完成后，许广平和海婴夫妇参观了鲁迅纪念馆。后来，他们重又回到墓地，徘徊留恋，不忍离去。
    时近正午，墓前的鲁迅塑像被笼罩在太阳的光芒里，仰首望去，光辉夺目。塑像后面巨大的墓碑上，横题着六个大字“鲁迅先生之墓”，这是毛泽东主席的手笔。墓碑下面最大的一个花环是中共中央敬献的，上面写着“鲁迅先生永垂不朽”。
