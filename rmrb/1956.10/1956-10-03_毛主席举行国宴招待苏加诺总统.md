Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. Chairman Mao Tse-tung gave a grand state banquet tonight in honor of President Sukarno.

Chairman Mao said at the banquet that the Indonesian people are a great people. The Chinese people have the greatest respect for the Indonesian people and President Sukarno. Chairman Mao praised President Sukarno's outstanding role in maintaining national unity and in the struggle against colonialism. Chairman Mao said: "Indonesia's abolition of the Round Table Conference Agreement and the struggle to demand the recovery of West Irian are just, and the Chinese people firmly support you." He also pointed out that Indonesia is playing an increasingly important role in international affairs.

Referring to Egypt's recovery of the Suez Canal Company, Chairman Mao said: "We, the peace-loving people of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the whole world, must continue to give firm support to Egypt's just struggle. The colonialists hope that we will be disunited, uncooperative, and unfriendly. We must answer them by strengthening unity and strengthening friendly cooperation. We must thoroughly bankrupt the colonialists' conspiracies."

Chairman Mao finally pointed out that the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Indonesia will surely be further consolidated and developed in the future.

President Sukarno then spoke at the banquet. He said: When I speak of the sympathy and friendship that exists between China and Indonesia, I am expressing the wishes from the bottom of the hearts of the Indonesian people. There are all the subjective and objective factors between China and Indonesia to promote the brotherly friendship between the two countries. President Sukarno said that we have common ground regarding the ideals of the future; your ideal is to build a new world where there is no exploitation of man by man, no oppression of man by man, where there is no suffering, where people can live freely and happily; our ideal is the same. He also said that there is another thing that makes us sympathize with each other, and that is that the Chinese and Indonesian people have suffered in the same way. President Sukarno said that in the past, today and in the future, there are many factors that prompt us to join hands like comrades-in-arms. Therefore, it is not difficult for me to come here to strengthen the friendly relations between the Chinese and Indonesian people.

All the members accompanying President Sukarno on his visit to China and the delegation of the Parliament of the Republic of Indonesia, the head of the Indonesian Bali Art Friendship Visiting Group, Indonesian peace activists and women representatives, and Indonesian Ambassador to China Wijopranoto were also invited to attend the banquet.
