    Low-Alloy Threaded Steel Rebar
    Low-alloy threaded steel rebar (25 manganese silicon) has recently been successfully trial-produced by three units: Tianjin Steel Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant.
    According to Soviet application results, this type of low-alloy threaded steel rebar (25 manganese silicon) can save 20% of steel compared to No. 5 steel threaded rebar, and 35% of steel compared to ordinary No. 3 steel rebar. The widespread adoption of this new type of rebar will greatly contribute to saving steel and reducing structural weight. (Qi Zaigui)
    Recording Echo Sounder
    China's first domestically made recording echo sounder – the Yangtze "56" model echo sounder – has been successfully trial-produced jointly by Wuhan Yucheng Electrical Machinery Factory, Xingchang Electrical Materials Store, and Wuhan No. 1 Radio Production Cooperative.
    This instrument was designed by the Hydrological Survey Team of the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission. On the morning of September 30, the instrument underwent its first test on the Hydrological "101" survey vessel of the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission; the test results were good.
    The total cost of materials and labor for the trial production of this instrument was approximately 4,000 yuan; much cheaper than recently purchased recording echo sounders from abroad.
    The domestically produced recording echo sounder has stable rotation speed and accurate measurement precision. It can measure shallow water as low as two meters deep and deep water up to one hundred and fifty meters, making it suitable for survey requirements of China's rivers and reservoirs.
    Heavy-Duty Balance
    China's first domestically made heavy-duty balance has been successfully trial-produced at the joint state-private Nanjing Instrument Factory.
    This heavy-duty balance, also known as a heavy-duty analytical balance, has a weighing range of three thousand grams; the lowest sensitivity is ten centigrams, equivalent to one three-hundred-thousandth of the full weighing range, and the highest sensitivity is two centigrams, equivalent to one one-million-five-hundred-thousandth of the full weighing range. It has the advantages of large weighing capacity, high sensitivity, and sensitive operation, making it suitable for water conservancy measurement and chemical analysis.
    After the successful trial production of this heavy-duty balance, it was jointly appraised by the Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City Metrology Appraisal Institute, engineers from the Industrial Bureau, professors from the Chemistry Teaching and Research Section of Nanjing Institute of Technology, and comrades from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission. The quality has reached international standards.
    New Projector
    A new type of 54-35 mobile projector has been successfully trial-produced at the state-owned Nanjing Film Machinery Factory. After projection tests, it was proven that the sound and picture clarity of this projector are very good.
    The 54-35 mobile projector is trial-produced based on a currently the latest type of mobile projector from the Soviet Union, and it has high precision; the projector has nearly six hundred types of parts, and more than one thousand three hundred pieces. This projector is for projecting thirty-five millimeter black and white films and color films. The projected picture is clear, the brightness is strong, and the sound range is wide. All the voices, songs, music, and natural sounds recorded in the film that people can hear, the projector can reproduce.
    The light path and film path of the projector have good protective plates, heat-filtering mirrors, fireproof pulleys and other fire prevention and heat filtering devices. The shape and structure of the projector have the advantages of tight protection and easy portability, making it suitable for mobile projection.

    低合金螺纹钢筋
    低合金螺纹钢筋（25锰硅）最近在天津钢厂、鞍山钢铁公司、太原钢铁厂三个单位试制成功。
    这种低合金螺纹钢筋（25锰硅），根据苏联应用的结果证明，比五号钢制的螺纹钢筋能节省20％的钢材，比普通三号钢制的钢筋可节省35％的钢材。广泛地采用这种新品种的钢筋，对节约钢材和减轻结构重量都有很大作用。（祁在贵）
    记录式回声测探仪
    中国自制的第一部记录式回声测探仪——长江“56”型回声测探仪，已经由武汉市钰成机电厂、兴昌电料行、武汉市第一无线电生产合作社配合试制完成。
    这部仪器是由长江水利委员会水文测量大队设计的。9月30日上午，这部仪器在长江水利委员会水文“一○一”号测轮上举行了首次试测；试测结果良好。
    试制这部仪器所用的全部材料及工费，共约四千元；比最近从国外购回的记录式回声测探仪便宜很多。
    国产的记录式回声测探仪，转速稳定，测验精度准确，最低可以测二公尺深的浅水，最高能测一百五十公尺的深水，适合于中国各江河和水库测验的要求。
    重型天平
    我国第一台自制重型天平，已在公私合营南京仪器厂试制成功。
    这种重型天平又名重型分析天平，称量有三千公分；最低感量是十公丝，等于全称量三十万分之一，最高感量是二公丝，等于全称量一百五十万分之一。它具有称量大、感量高、使用灵敏等优点，适用于水利测量和化学分析。
    这台重型天平试制成功后，经江苏省，南京市度量衡鉴定所、工业厅工程师及南京工学院化学教研组教授会同黄河水利委员会的同志共同参加鉴定，质量达到国际水平。
    新型放映机
    新型的54—35型移动式放映机在国营南京电影机械厂试制成功。经过放映试验，证明这种放映机的声音和画面的清晰度都很好。
    54—35型移动式放映机，是根据苏联目前一种最新型的移动式放映机试制的，精密度很高；放映机的零件有近六百种，一千三百多件。这种放映机是放映三十五毫米黑白影片和彩色影片的，放映的画面清晰，光亮度强，音域广。凡是影片纪录的人所能听到的说话声、歌声、音乐声，以及自然界的声音，放映机都能还原出来。
    放映机的发光路线和影片路线，有很好的防护板、滤热镜、防火滑轮等防火和滤热装置。放映机的外形和结构，具有保护严密、携带轻便的优点，适合流动放映。
