　　Guangdong Builds Six Sugar Factories
　　Of the six sugar factories planned to be built in Guangdong Province, four have already started construction in full swing; the other two factories are also actively carrying out preparations before construction. These six sugar factories will be completed and put into production successively in the next three years. Their designed capacity is a total of 12,000 tons of sugarcane crushed per day, and nearly 350,000 tons of white granulated sugar and brown sugar can be produced in one sugarcane crushing season.
　　The six sugar factories are: Nanhai Sugar Factory, Zhongshan Sugar Factory, Huiyang Sugar Factory, Yangjiang Sugar Factory, Bei Yu Sugar Factory, and Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Sugar Factory. The construction engineering and machinery equipment of the first four sugar factories are designed and manufactured by our country; the latter two sugar factories are built with the help of Poland and Czechoslovakia respectively. At present, the Nanhai and Zhongshan sugar factories, which are progressing faster, have completed most of the factory building construction and are gradually installing machinery and equipment.
　　The technical personnel and production workers required for the six sugar factories to be put into production are being actively trained; at the same time, the agricultural departments are also actively expanding the planting area of sugarcane to prepare raw materials for the new sugar factories.

　　Hubei's First Rubber Factory
　　Hubei Province's first rubber factory—the joint state-private Huangshi Rubber Factory—has recently started construction on the shore of Qingshan Lake in the emerging industrial and mining city of Huangshi.
　　This factory is the result of the merger and relocation of the joint state-private Nanyang and Huacheng rubber factories and the joint state-private Baile shoe upper factory from Shanghai.
　　In the past, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, and Henan did not have rubber factories, and the sneakers, athletic shoes, and other supplies needed in these provinces had to be transported from far away. After the joint state-private Huangshi Rubber Factory is completed, it will be able to produce about 1.6 million pairs of sneakers and athletic shoes each year, which can meet the needs of the people in Hubei and neighboring provinces.
　　It is expected that this factory will be put into production in the first quarter of next year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
　　Jiaxing Can Produce Saccharin
　　A saccharin workshop built by the Zhejiang joint state-private Jiaxing Chemical Factory was officially put into production on September 3.
　　Saccharin is a chemical medicine with a wide range of uses. It is needed in industries such as medicine, food, cigarettes, and toothpaste, as well as for people to eat. In the past, our country could not manufacture it ourselves, and it was all imported from abroad. Now, our country has three factories that can produce saccharin, which can manufacture about 100 tons of saccharin each year.

　　Shanghai Tool Factory Expands Five Times
　　The state-owned Shanghai Tool Factory, famous for manufacturing various precision cutting tools, has recently completed a new factory with an area five times larger than the old factory, by adopting the method of expanding while producing over the past three years.
　　Over the years, the Shanghai Tool Factory has manufactured a large number of cutting tools such as milling cutters, hobbing cutters, reamers, taps, and drills, supplying mechanical factories throughout the country. With the rapid development of the machinery industry, various places have requested the Shanghai Tool Factory to produce cemented carbide tools with higher cutting efficiency. The newly built factory is equipped with rare broaching machines, shaping machines, gear shaper cutter special grinding machines, and extremely precise measuring instruments. The newly built workshop will specialize in manufacturing precision cutting tools such as insert knives, gear cutting tools, and modular tools necessary for various modern machine tools. According to design requirements, the annual production of precision cutting tools in this factory will reach more than 440 tons.

    到处是一片建设景象
    广东兴建六个糖厂
    广东省计划兴建的六座糖厂，已有四座全面动工；另外两个厂也正在积极进行施工前的准备工作。这六个糖厂将在今后三年内先后建成投入生产。它们的设计能力总共为每日榨蔗一万二千吨，一个榨蔗季节可以生产白砂糖和赤砂糖近三十五万吨。
    这六个糖厂是：南海糖厂、中山糖厂、惠阳糖厂、阳江糖厂、北于糖厂和广州华侨糖厂。前四个糖厂的建筑工程和机器设备都是由我国自己设计和制造的；后两个糖厂是分别由波兰、捷克斯洛伐克帮助兴建的。现在，工程进度较快的南海、中山两个糖厂已经完成大部分厂房建筑工程，正在陆续安装机器设备。
    六座糖厂投入生产时所需要的技术人员和生产工人正在积极培养训练中；同时，农业部门也正在积极扩大甘蔗的种植面积，为新糖厂准备制糖原料。

    湖北第一座橡胶厂
    湖北省第一座橡胶工厂——公私合营黄石橡胶厂，最近已在新兴的工矿城黄石市的青山湖畔动工兴建。
    这个工厂是由上海公私合营南洋、华成两个橡胶厂和公私合营百乐鞋帮厂合并内迁的。
    过去，湖北、湖南、河南等省都没有橡胶厂，这些省份需要的球鞋、力士鞋等用品，都要从远地运来。公私合营黄石橡胶厂建成后，每年能产球鞋、力士鞋一百六十万双左右，可以就近供应湖北各地和邻近省份人民的需要。
    预计这个工厂明年第一季度就可投入生产。（据新华社讯）
    嘉兴能生产糖精
    浙江公私合营嘉兴化工厂兴建的一座糖精车间，已经在9月3日正式投入生产。
    糖精是一种化学药品，用途很广，医药、食品、卷烟、牙膏等工业和人民食用都需要它。过去，我国自己不会制造，全部由国外输入。现在我国共有三个能生产糖精的工厂，每年能制造一百吨左右糖精。

    上海工具厂扩大五倍
    以制造各种精密切削工具著名的国营上海工具厂，三年来采取边生产边扩建的办法，最近建成了一座面积比老厂大五倍的新厂。
    上海工具厂历年来曾经制造出大量的铣刀、滚刀、铰刀、丝攻、丝锥和钻头等切削工具，供应了全国各地机械工厂。随着机械工业迅速发展，各地要求上海工具厂生产有更高切削效率的硬质合金刀。现在建成的新厂，安装了其他工厂少有的拉床、铲床、插齿刀专门磨床，以及极其精密的计量仪器等设备。新建的车间将专门制造各种现代化机床上必须的镶片刀具、齿轮刀具和组合刀具等精密切削工具。按照设计要求，这个厂一年生产的精密切削工具，将要达到四百四十吨以上。
