Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 22nd -- Indian Prime Minister Nehru said in Calcutta on the 21st that the acute stage of the Suez Canal crisis has passed, although there are still many difficulties in reaching a peaceful settlement.

He explained India's role to reporters, saying that various solutions have emerged as a result of Menon's recent meetings and consultations with the governments of Egypt, Britain, France, and the United States. He said, "In fact, due to some prior consultations, we have drafted some tentative proposals. However, we do not wish to put them forward; it would be better for the parties concerned to reach an agreement."

Nehru said that the acceptance of six principles at the recent Security Council meeting by the parties concerned was a major step forward. India is not within the Security Council, but India's talks and its previous work have been beneficial.

Regarding the issue of international control of the Suez Canal, Nehru said that it is quite obvious that Egypt will not agree to such control, because Egypt believes this would negate its sovereignty. However, Egypt has indicated that it is prepared to guarantee that the canal will function effectively and impartially in the best way.

Nehru said, "I think the Egyptian government has adopted a moderate and reasonable attitude in these negotiations."

Nehru welcomed the agreement reached in the Japan-Soviet negotiations. He said that this agreement will end the nominal state of war. He welcomed this agreement because it helps to eliminate a factor in world tension.

    尼赫鲁发表谈话说
    苏伊士危机尖锐阶段已经过去
    埃及显然不会同意“国际管制”运河
    据新华社新德里22日电　印度总理尼赫鲁21日在加尔各答说，苏伊士运河危机的尖锐阶段已经过去，虽然在达成和平解决方面还有许多困难。
    他对新闻记者解释印度所起的作用说，由于梅农最近同埃及、英国、法国和美国的政府举行会谈和协商，各种办法产生了。他说：“事实上，由于先前的某些协商，我们已经草拟了某些临时建议。但是，我们不希望把它们提出来，由有关方面取得协议将更好一些。”
    尼赫鲁说，有关方面在最近的安全理事会会议上接受六项原则是向前进的一大步。印度不在安全理事会以内，但是印度所进行的会谈和它先前作的工作是有益处的。
    谈到国际管制苏伊士运河问题时，尼赫鲁说，十分明显，埃及不会同意这种管制，因为埃及认为这是取消它的主权。然而，埃及已经表明，它准备以最好的方式来保证运河有效地和无私地发挥作用。
    尼赫鲁说：“我认为埃及政府在这些谈判中采取了温和的和合理的态度。”
    尼赫鲁对于苏日谈判达成协议表示欢迎。他说，这个协议将结束名义上的战争状态。他欢迎这个协议，因为这是有助于消除世界紧张局势中的一个因素。
