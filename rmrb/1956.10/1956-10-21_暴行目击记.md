Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 20th: The Hong Kong "New Evening News" published an article titled "Eyewitness Account of Atrocities" written by an author named Yin Teng.

The author lived near the intersection of Castle Peak Road and Tai Po Road in Sham Shui Po, Kowloon, near Li Zhengwu Village. Yin Teng said that he witnessed the riots of the thugs in this area clearly from the beginning of the incident until 3:00 PM on October 11th.

The organized riots in this area broke out after 9:30 PM on October 10th. At that time, more and more people gathered here. They ran out from the various streets of the resettlement area (Editor's Note by Xinhua News Agency: The resettlement area is where landlords and bullies who fled from the mainland are settled), initially gathering in an open space in front of the People's Building, shouting and yelling. About dozens of feet away from their gathering point, a large team of police officers formed a line, defending the entrance of Castle Peak Road. After a standoff for several tens of minutes, the police officers did not take the offensive, so the thugs poured out of the railings, shouting loudly, some occupying the lawn, some rushing into Kweilin Street and Pei Ho Street, and some distributing themselves on both sides of Tai Po Road. This area was completely occupied by them, and the riot began. Using stones, wooden sticks, and glass bottles as weapons, all the cars passing through here were attacked from all directions, creating a chaotic noise.

At around 10:30 PM, the police officers took action, firing tear gas at the crowd, and a thick smoke filled the entire area. The thugs retreated one after another, but after the smoke cleared, the thugs gathered again and threw stones fiercely at the police officers dozens of feet away. The thugs always controlled this area.

At this moment, there was a sudden burst of shouts. It turned out that in the People's Building, a man in a white shirt and blue trousers, under the protection of two or three other men, somehow obtained a flag and rushed to the "front line," planting it on the first lawn in the street under the cover of countless stones and shouts. This place was only a dozen feet away from the police.

At this time, the entire area was controlled by the thugs. Dozens of bicycles with flags shuttled back and forth, as if conveying orders. A "white license" car drove into Tai Po Road amid the applause of the thugs. Several men in the car waved to the thugs, and even stopped the car to talk to the thugs surrounding the car for about a minute before driving straight towards Tsuen Wan.

Soon, a man ran from the south side of Tai Po Road. He held a flag and, under the escort of several bicycles, rushed to the first lawn and planted the flag on the grass. At this time, the police's tear gas became suddenly dense. The thugs learned how to extinguish tear gas from somewhere. When a tear gas canister landed among them, they covered it with a wet cloth, or kicked it back to the police position like kicking a soccer ball, or wrapped it in a wet cloth and threw it back.

The eight trucks in the parking lot of the Garden Biscuit & Confectionery Company were set on fire by the thugs at around 11:00 PM on October 10th. At this time, the thugs were controlling the lawn area, and the police officers were concentrated at the front door of Garden. The trucks were parked at the back door of Garden. At that time, only three or five men were seen squatting under the trucks, starting a fire. They probably had something to start the fire, and within a few minutes, the fire was raging, and the flames soared into the sky. All eight trucks were on fire at the same time. At this time, the police officers were only a dozen feet away from the fire.

Most newspapers said that the fire in the Garden factory was caused by the spread of the flames from the trucks, but that was not the case. I personally saw a man take a long bamboo pole, light it, and put it into a window on the second floor of Garden. More than ten minutes later, the second floor of Garden was the first to catch fire. This was arson, not spreading. The arson that destroyed the innocent Garden Company (with police officers nearby), the cruelty of the process, and the lawlessness of the thugs have left the residents with lingering fears.

At the same time as the Garden fire, the goods of the New China Native Produce Company were openly burned on Tai Po Road. The two fires were about one or two hundred yards apart. The raging fire and thick smoke plunged the residents into a world of terror.

On the morning of the 11th, there were still sporadic sounds of tear gas on Castle Peak Road. At around 10:00 AM, a gunshot rang out, and a man fell to the ground on the first lawn, bleeding and no longer moving. They then reoccupied their position from last night, holding sticks and picking up stones, preparing everything. At this time, several men took out a Kuomintang flag from the People's Building, and ran to the first lawn amidst shouts, covering the dead man with the flag, and even seemed to be standing at attention and observing a moment of silence. Later, for some reason, another Kuomintang flag was stuck next to the dead man.

From 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM, the thugs controlled this area for four hours. Their first activity was to block traffic. The driver of a postal truck was beaten away, and the postal truck was overturned by the thugs. A leader-like figure ordered the accomplices to leave, but then he raised his hand and threw a bottle or can of something onto the truck, lit a match and threw it, and with a "whoosh" the truck immediately caught fire. The man left the fire scene in one step, and his arson was very prepared, and his "technique" was very skilled.

It is worth noting that the bicycle team still shuttled back and forth like on the evening of the 10th. The mysterious white license car reappeared. In addition to waving the flag in the wind, the people in the car also raised their arms and waved to the thugs. He received enthusiastic "cheers."

At about 1:00 PM on the 11th, a car without a flag drove from south to north on Tai Po Road. Because it did not have a flag, after being pelted with stones, it was intercepted by the thugs in front of the Ling Tung Middle School. The thugs ran from all strongholds, surrounding the car from all directions, some holding wooden sticks, some holding stones, shouting and yelling. They dragged out the driver, intending to beat him severely, when suddenly, "Hold it!" someone shouted. It turned out that they found a foreign couple in the car. So the thugs opened the car door and forced the foreign couple out, but seeing the dangerous situation, the foreigners refused to come out. On the other side, thugs dragged the Western woman's feet, pulling her outwards. But the Western woman resisted desperately. After about two minutes of this struggle, all the glass on the car was broken. Later, the thugs became bestial and overturned the car and set it on fire. When the car overturned, the thug who was dragging the Western woman did not have time to escape and was pinned by the car. Gasoline was poured on the car, and the entire car caught fire, shouting for help, but no one paid attention. The thugs were watching the two people in the car being burned alive. At this time, the driver had taken the opportunity to escape.

The foreigner probably had some strength. He was the first to climb out of the broken glass window in the burning car, fell to the ground, his clothes torn, and his face covered in blood. At this time, the Western woman struggled in the car for a while, poked her head out of the window. The terrifying attack made her seem to have fallen into the abyss of hell, and she could not even shout, but only made a few squeaking sounds. The foreigner ran a few steps and suddenly realized something, hurriedly turned around and jumped back into the car, rescuing the Western woman. The poor innocent woman's upper body clothes were completely burned, and fresh blood flowed from her naked upper body. There were still a few flames on her skirt. She was almost unconscious when she stepped on the ground. When they, already seriously injured, fled, I saw that they were still inevitably pelted with stones again. At this time, I doubted whether I was still in a "civilized world" under the broad daylight!

According to newspaper reports, I learned that this foreign couple was the Swiss Deputy Consul and his wife stationed in Hong Kong.

    暴行目击记
    新华社广州20日电　香港“新晚报”登载了一篇署名因滕写的“暴行目击记”。
    这位作者家住在九龙深水埗青山道和大埔道交界的附近，邻近李郑屋村。因滕说，他从事件开始到11日下午三时，对这个区域的暴徒的骚乱看得清清楚楚。
    这个地区有组织的骚乱从10日下午9时半以后爆发。当时，这里的人愈聚愈多。他们从徙置区（新华社编者按：徙置区就是安置大陆逃亡的地主恶霸的地方）的各条街道跑出来，起初集结在平民大厦前面的一片旷地里，叫嚣呼啸。在他们的集结地点约数十呎之外，大队警员排成一字阵势，防守在青山道口。相持几十分钟后，警员未采攻势，于是暴徒们涌出栏杆，高声呼喊，一部分人占据草坪，一部分人冲入桂林街和北河街，一部分人分布大埔道两旁。这个区域给他们完全占领了，暴乱于是开始。他们以石头、木棍、玻璃瓶为武器，所有经过这里的汽车，都遭到前后左右的袭击，当时一阵响乱。
    约在十时半左右，警员采取行动，催泪弹向人群处发射，一时浓烟密布，笼罩了整个区域。暴徒们纷纷退避，但在浓烟过后，暴徒又麕集起来，向几十呎外的警员猛掷石头。暴徒们始终控制了这个区域。
    这时，突然喊声雷动，原来在平民大厦里，有一个穿白衣衫蓝裤的男子，在另两三个男子的保卫下，不知从那里弄来一面旗，持旗飞奔上“前线”，在无数石头和呐喊的掩护下，插在街中第一个草坪，这里距离警方只有十多呎。
    这时，整个区域全给暴徒们控制，竖旗的数十辆单车，穿插来往，好像在传达命令。有一辆“白牌”车，在暴徒的鼓掌声中，驶入大埔道。车上有几名男子向暴徒们挥手致意，在转入向荃湾的道上，还停车向围绕车子两旁的暴徒谈了一分钟左右，然后直向荃湾驶去。
    不久，从大埔道南面又跑来一个男子，他持旗在数辆单车的护卫下，又冲到第一个草坪，把旗插在草地上。这时，警方的催泪弹突然密集起来。暴徒们不知从那里学会了扑灭催泪弹的方法，有催泪弹射到他们之中时，他们把湿布盖上，或者用脚像踢足球般踢回警方阵地，或者用湿布包起掷回。
    嘉顿饼干糖果公司停车场的八辆货车，在10日下午十一时左右被暴徒纵火焚烧。这时，暴徒们正控制草坪一带，警员集中在嘉顿的前门，货车都停放在嘉顿的后门。当时只见有三五个男子，蹲在货车下面引火，他们大概有引火的东西，不数分钟，火光熊熊，烈焰冲天，八辆货车一起着火了。这时，警员们距离火场只有十多呎。
    大多数报纸都说，嘉顿厂房的起火，是因货车的火焰所蔓延，其实不是。我亲眼看见一个男子拿了一支长竹，点着了火，向嘉顿二楼的一个窗口放入，隔了十余分钟，嘉顿二楼便首先着火。这是纵火，并不是蔓延。纵火焚毁无辜的嘉顿公司（警员近在咫尺），过程的惨酷，和暴徒们的无法无天，街坊群众心悸未已。
    和嘉顿的被焚起火的同时，有新中土产公司的货物，被公开焚毁于大埔道。两个火头相距约一二百码，熊熊大火，烈焰浓烟，使坊众们陷入了一个恐怖世界之中。
    11日上午，青山道仍有断续的催泪弹声响。十时左右，一声枪响，一个男子流着血，倒在第一个草坪上，再也不动弹了。他们于是再度盘踞他们昨晚的阵地，持棍捡石，准备一切。这时，有几个男子在平民大厦里取出一面国民党旗，在呼啸中跑到第一个草坪，把旗盖在死者身上，还似乎在立正、默哀。后来不知怎的，死者身旁又多插了一枝国民党旗。
    由十时到下午二时，暴徒们控制了这个区有四个钟头。他们首先的活动是封锁交通。有一辆邮车的司机被打跑了，邮车被暴徒们推翻，一个状若领袖的人物，喝令帮凶们离开，但见他一扬手，一瓶一罐的不知是什么东西扔到车上，划一根火柴一丢，“熊”的一声车子顿时着火，这个男子一个箭步便离火场，其纵火烧车非常有准备，“技术”是非常熟练的。
    可堪注意的是：单车队仍像10
  日晚一样的穿梭般来住，神秘的白牌车再度出现，车中人除持旗迎风飘荡外，还高扬手臂向暴徒们挥动，他受到热烈的“欢呼”。
    约11日下午一时许，一辆没有悬旗的汽车由南向北驶过大埔道。由于它没有悬旗，在吃了一顿石子之后，便给暴徒在岭东分校门前截着了，暴徒们纷纷从各据点跑来，四面包围车子，有的手持木棍，有的手捧石头，呐喊呼啸，高声喝打。他们揪出司机，正拟痛殴，突然“咪住！”一声，原来他们发现车内有一对男女洋人。于是暴徒们打开车门，强迫这对洋人出来，然而洋人眼见情势凶险，死也不肯出来。另一边有暴徒把西妇的双脚拖着，向外拉。但西妇竭力拒抗，这样坚持了约二分钟，车子上的所有玻璃都给敲破了，后来暴徒们兽性大发，把车子推翻放火，在车子翻侧时，拖西妇的暴徒走避不及，给车子压着手臂，电油浇在车上，全车着火，大喊救命，但没有人理会，暴徒们正注视车内两个人被活生生的火焚。这时，司机已乘机逃走。
    这位洋人大概有些气力，他在火焚的车中，首先从破玻璃窗口爬出来，跌到地下，遍体衣服破碎，流血满面。这时西妇在车中挣扎了一会，在窗中探出头来，恐怖的突袭，使她好像坠下了深渊地狱，连呼叫都喊不出声，只是吱吱地响了几声。洋人跑了几步忽有所悟，连忙转身再跳上车上，把西妇救了出来，可怜这位无辜的女人，上身衣服全被烧光，鲜血从她的赤裸上身流下，裙子还有一点点的火焰，当她踏到地上时差不多已昏迷了。当已受到重伤的他们逃走时，我眼见他们仍不免再吃了一顿石头。我这时怀疑我是否还处在一个光天化日下的“文明世界”！
    这对洋人，我根据各报的报道：知道他们便是瑞士的驻港副领事夫妇。
