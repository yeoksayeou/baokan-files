	A Contrast
	Shi Yi
	When I was in the South before, I heard quite a bit about the service attitude of Beijing merchants. After living in Beijing for a few years, I didn't have many opportunities to interact with stores, and I encountered even less of the rumored warm and considerate style towards customers, especially in some service industries like barbershops and bathhouses. Recently, in order to get new glasses, I discovered a clear contrast.
	
	I wanted to get my glasses, which I had been wearing for more than ten years, replaced. I was afraid of queuing up at the hospital to register, so I heard that a new-style eyewear company on Dong'anmen Street had a good reputation for eye exams and lens production. But I went there four times in a row and couldn't get a number, because they said I had to come at 9:30 in the morning. Unfortunately, due to work and the commute, I couldn't spare that time, so I couldn't get the glasses made for a month or two. Then, one day, I broke my glasses. A nearsighted person can't function without glasses, so I rushed to that eyewear company, thinking that even hospitals have emergency appointments, so I would definitely be able to get them made this time. But even though the store was quiet and empty of customers, my wish was still not fulfilled. A gentleman sitting at the counter said coldly, "Today's appointments for eye exams are full. Come at 9:30 tomorrow." I showed him my broken glasses and asked if he could make an exception. "No!" he shook his head. I asked if I could buy a pair of ready-made glasses with roughly the same prescription to make do for a while. He shook his head again: "No!" I pleaded for a full twenty minutes, begging him to help me find a solution. Still no. I couldn't help but ask him if he was there to serve customers. That set him off, "You don't follow our rules, and you criticize people!" Right, my glasses didn't break according to the eyewear company's rules, so what could he do? I had no choice but to leave in silence.
	
	But I couldn't run around on the street without seeing people's faces. Suddenly, I remembered seeing another eyewear store on Wangfujing Street. Judging by the look of the storefront, it was probably an old-style Beijing store. So I ran to this old-style store. As soon as I walked in, there was only an elderly gentleman attending to two or three customers. When he saw me, he quickly said, "Excuse me, please wait a moment." and asked me to sit on the sofa. After he finished with the other customers, he took me to the eye exam room to check my eyes. The exam was very careful and friendly. When we came out of the exam room, he specifically told me that I might feel a little dizzy after seeing the light outside. He recorded the prescription, and then took out various lenses and frames, telling me the price of each one and letting me choose. He also told me, "It will take three weeks to grind the lenses because the factory can only grind eight pairs a day. Now I'll find another pair of glasses with a similar prescription for you to wear in the meantime. You can return them when your new glasses are ready." I felt embarrassed and offered to buy another pair, but he resolutely refused. So I left my broken glasses behind, put on the free glasses, and went home, waiting patiently for my new glasses.
	
	The same type of eyewear store, one new and one old, with completely different service attitudes towards customers. This can't help but make people feel deeply moved and realize that we originally had many good traditions, but many people always forget them.

    一个对比
    适夷
    以前在南方的时候，对于北京商人的服务态度，是颇听到一些口碑的。在北京住了几年，和商店之类接触的机会不多，传闻中的那种对顾客的殷勤体贴的作风，碰到的更少，特别是在理发铺、澡堂等某些服务事业中。最近为了配眼镜，却发现了一个显明的对比。
    为了想把用了十多年的眼镜重新配过，又怕到医院排队挂号，听说东安门大街一家新式的眼镜公司，验光制片都不错，可是一连跑了四次，都挂不上号，说是必须早上九点半才行，偏偏因为办公和路途的关系，匀不出这个时间，这样就拖了一两个月没有配成。偏偏有一天，把眼镜打碎了，近视眼的人没有眼镜就没法儿活动，连忙又跑到那家眼镜公司去，以为医院里也得有个急诊号，这一回一定配得成了。可是铺子里虽然清清闲闲地不见顾客，我的愿望还是达不到，坐在柜上一位先生冷冷地说：“今天验光的号已经满了，明天九点半来。”我把打碎的眼镜给他看，问可不可通融一下。“不行！”他摇摇头。再问可不可以现成先买一面差不多光度的凑和一下。他又摇一摇头：“不行！”这样地，诉了整整二十分钟的苦，求他想法子帮一下忙。还是一个不行。我有点忍不住了，问他到底是不是给顾客服务的。这一下，可把他问火了，“你自己不遵守我们的制度，还来批评人家！”对啦，我的眼镜不按照眼镜公司的制度打碎，那还有什么法子呢，只好默然退出。
    可是我总不能对面不见人面地在大路上瞎跑，忽然记起在王府大街见过另一家眼镜铺，照那门面的样子，大概是北京的一家老式铺子，我就跑到这家老式铺子里去。一跑进去，只有一位年老的先生在应对两三位顾客。他见了我，忙说“对不起，请等一等。”让我在沙发上坐下。他把别的顾客打发走了，就带我到验光室里验光。验得非常仔细，亲切，走出验光室，又特地关照我，见了外边的光线，也许会有些头晕。这样他纪录了光度，又拿出各种镜片，眼架，一一把价目告诉我，让我挑选。又告诉我，“磨好镜片得三个星期，因为工场里每天只能磨八副，现在我另外找一副光度差不多的镜子，你凑合着戴几天，配好了新眼镜再还我。”我觉得不好意思，愿意另外买一副，可是他坚决不要。我就把破眼镜丢下，戴上一副不花钱的眼镜回来，安心地等待新眼镜。
    同样的眼镜铺子，一新一老，对顾客的服务态度，截然不同，这怎能不叫人发生很大的感触，觉得我们本来就有许多好的传统，可是许多人老是把它忘掉。
