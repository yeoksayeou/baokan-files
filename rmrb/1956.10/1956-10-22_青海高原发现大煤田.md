Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 20th -- Coalfield geological personnel recently discovered a promising large coalfield -- the Weiyuan Coalfield -- on the plateau south of the Qilian Mountains in Qinghai Province, at an altitude of over 3,000 meters.

According to geological data already obtained by prospectors, the coalfield extends between the Qilian Mountains and the Daban Mountains, spanning a length of more than 120 kilometers and a width of 15 kilometers; the mineable coal seam is approximately 20 meters thick.

The Weiyuan Coalfield is located approximately 100 kilometers northwest of Xining. In the past, local farmers have dug some coal here for fuel, but no formal geological exploration has ever been carried out. In April this year, Northwest Coalfield geological exploration personnel climbed the Qilian Mountains for the first time to prospect for coal sources, working for more than three months and surveying an area of more than 1,500 square kilometers. They are currently preparing the exploration design in preparation for the next stage of detailed exploration work.

Qinghai Province currently only has the Datong Coal Mine to supply the province's coal consumption, and even with the Yuka Coal Mine to be built in the Qaidam Basin, it cannot meet the needs. The discovery of the Weiyuan Coalfield will accelerate the speed of coal industry construction in Qinghai Province.

    青海高原发现大煤田
    新华社西安20日电　在青海省祁连山南麓海拔三千多公尺的高原上，煤田地质人员最近新找到一个很有希望的大煤田——亹源煤田。
    根据踏勘工作者已经得到的地质资料证实，这个煤田伸展在祁连山和大板山之间，长达一百二十多公里，宽十五公里；可采的煤层厚约二十公尺。
    亹源煤田位在西宁西北约一百多公里处，过去虽然有当地的农民在这里挖一些煤做燃料，但是一直没有做过正式的地质勘查工作。今年4月间，西北煤田地质勘探人员，第一次攀上祁连上踏勘煤源，一直工作了三个多月，踏勘面积一千五百多平方公里。现在，他们正在编制勘探设计，准备下一步的详细勘探工作。
    青海省现在只有一个大通煤矿供给本省的用煤，加上柴达木盆地里将要建成的鱼卡煤矿，也不能满足需要。亹源煤田的发现，将会加速青海省煤炭工业建设的速度。
