Xinhua News Agency, Da Qaidam, 30th - The base established by the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau's Geological Department for field workers in Da Qaidam is taking shape. This unit's more than 4,000 field workers who will be wintering in Qaidam this year will conduct indoor work and reunite with their families at this base. As of now, more than 38,400 square meters of earth and wood structure houses have been built at this base. Among these houses, more than 100 rooms have been specially arranged for field workers to organize materials, draw maps, and study. The 402 Women's Leveling Team, which overfulfilled its plan for this year, has come to live here after finishing its field work and has begun indoor work. Family dormitories capable of housing 200 to 300 households will also be fully built, with each household able to live in two or three small rooms. This year, the families of more than 200 workers who cannot return home will be brought here to reunite with the workers. While establishing the base in Da Qaidam this year, the Geological Department also took some measures to improve the welfare of the workers. They bought two film projectors and are currently setting up a club, a library, and a dance floor, and are building six new basketball and volleyball courts. A power generation unit capable of generating 200 kilowatts is being planned for installation, and wiring and installation of light fixtures are underway in some houses. The entire base will be supplied with electricity and lighting next month. A new warm water bathhouse will also be established at the same time. To enable some of the weaker workers to get more nutrition, they will also hold three nutrition canteens. The department's amateur drama troupe will also prepare some theatrical programs to perform for the workers wintering here.
