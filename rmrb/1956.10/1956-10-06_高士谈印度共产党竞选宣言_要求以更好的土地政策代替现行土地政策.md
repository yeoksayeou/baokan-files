Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 4th: According to a report in the "Times of India," Ajoy Ghosh, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, stated at a press conference in Lucknow on October 3rd that the Communist Party of India's election manifesto will demand better land policies to replace current ones. He said that the current land policy is hesitant in its implementation and has many shortcomings. "For example, in Uttar Pradesh, the government has refused to stipulate the maximum amount of land ownership as recommended by the Planning Commission."

Ghosh said that in addition to demanding the nationalization of the coal industry, jute, and tea plantations, which are almost entirely controlled by foreigners, the Communist Party of India will also demand the nationalization of the banking industry, higher wages for industrial workers, and lower prices.

Ghosh also said that the Communist Party of India will also demand increased powers for elected bodies and reduced powers for local governors, appropriate amendments to police regulations to prevent the police from arbitrarily shooting at the people, and the abolition of the President's emergency powers because the exercise of such powers has damaged the interests of various opposition parties.

Ghosh also welcomed the Progressive People's United Front recently formed in Uttar Pradesh. He hoped that the Praja Socialist Party and the Socialist Party, which have not participated in this front, will be able to reach some kind of arrangement with the Progressive People's United Front.

    高士谈印度共产党竞选宣言
    要求以更好的土地政策代替现行土地政策
    新华社新德里4日电　据“印度时报”报道，印度共产党总书记高士10月3日在勒克瑙的一次记者招待会上说，印度共产党的竞选宣言将要求以更好的土地政策来代替现行的土地政策。他说，现在的土地政策在执行的过程中踌躇不前，而且缺点很多，“例如在北方省，政府就拒绝按照计划委员会所建议的那样规定土地占有量的最高限额”。
    高士说，印度共产党除了要求把几乎完全为外国人控制的煤炭工业、黄麻和茶叶种植业收归国有以外，还将要求把银行业收归国有，要求提高产业工人的工资和降低物价。
    高士还说，印度共产党还将要求增加选举产生的机构的权力和减少各地方长官的权力，适当修改警察条例，使警察不能任意开枪射击人民，以及取消总统的紧急权力，因为这种紧急权力行使的结果损害了各反对党的利益。
    高士还对最近在北方省组成的进步人民联合阵线表示欢迎，他希望没有参加这个阵线的人民社会党和社会党能够同进步人民联合阵线达成某种安排。
