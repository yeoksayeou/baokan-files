    The Development of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the Mongolian People's Republic
    By Dé Duō'ěrzhiguǒtuōbó, Vice Chairman of the Central Council of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the Mongolian People's Republic

    The Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the Mongolian People's Republic is one of the largest social organizations in our country, and it demonstrates the people's great achievements in developing their economy. The purpose of the Mongolian Supply and Marketing Cooperative is to maximize the satisfaction of the people's growing material and cultural needs, to correctly utilize livestock products, and to ensure the needs of the country's industry and exports.

    The continuous development of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the Mongolian People's Republic is the result of the correct leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the constant selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union.

    Before the People's Revolution in 1921, Mongolia was a place of competition for foreign capitalists and their market. The secular and religious feudal lords who held power repeatedly betrayed national interests and acted as obedient tools in the hands of foreign capitalists.

    With the help of enemies within the Mongolian people, capitalists and usurers rode on the necks of the working people, hindering the further development of the country. During this period, the country had no industry of its own, and animal husbandry was operated using the most primitive methods.

    This gave foreign capitalists and usurers the possibility of widespread infiltration, and they engaged in undisguised acts of plunder against the people at will. For example, in 1918-1919, branches of some foreign banks appeared in Kulun (now Ulaanbaatar) and other places. These banks issued banknotes, violently plundered gold mines, purchased various important agricultural products used as raw materials at extremely low prices, and harmed herdsmen with debts and interest. The Mongolian feudal lords owed foreign capitalists a total of about 20 million US dollars. For example, the feudal lords of Kobdo had to pay Chinese merchants 75,000 horses, 400,000 cattle, 55,000 camels, and 500,000 sheep and goats.

    At that time, the total number of livestock in the hands of herdsmen in this aimak (province) was only equivalent to 60%-70% of these debts. Therefore, although the herdsmen also had a small number of livestock, they were actually deprived. In order to repay some debts to the capitalists, the feudal lords levied taxes on the herdsmen several times a year.

    The People's Revolution of 1921 overthrew the rule of internal and external enemies, opening up broad possibilities for the people of our country to develop the national economy and culture as much as possible. In the early years, an urgent task facing the People's Government was to establish national commerce and expel foreign merchants from its own market.

    The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the government, led by Sukhbaatar and Choibalsan, decided to establish supply and marketing cooperatives in accordance with the doctrines and instructions of V.I. Lenin. On September 24, 1921, our country began to establish supply and marketing cooperatives. At the beginning, the supply and marketing cooperatives sold 15,000 Tugriks (Mongolian currency) worth of goods and purchased 44,000 Tugriks worth of raw materials. Basic-level cooperatives were quickly established in various counties. During the initial years of the people's regime, cooperative enterprises encountered considerable resistance from class enemies—representatives of the overthrown feudal lord class, capitalists, and others. However, under the leadership of the Party, the supply and marketing cooperatives crushed the resistance of the enemies and developed into one of the mass organizations.

    With the direct help of the great Soviet Union, cooperative enterprises began to successfully solve the tasks facing them.

    The Party helped many supply and marketing cooperatives to purge enemies, saboteurs, and malingerers, and continued to consolidate the organization organizationally and economically. In this regard, the establishment of the Industrial and Commercial Bank, the issuance of national currency, and the cancellation of debts to foreign merchants were of particular significance. These measures clearly proved that the Mongolian people resolutely implemented the policy of developing the country along a non-capitalist road.

    By 1940, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the Mongolian People's Republic had more than 100,000 members. Our country began the period of socialist revolution around 1940. This further enhanced the role of the supply and marketing cooperatives in the cause of building a socialist foundation.

    The Supply and Marketing Cooperative achieved great success in fulfilling its obligation to actively participate in the implementation of the first five-year plan (1948-1952).

    Our supply and marketing cooperative is a social organization established on the principle of voluntariness, and it realizes its functions of selling goods and purchasing raw materials with the direct participation of its members. It independently manages its business in accordance with the cooperative's articles of association.

    The Supply and Marketing Cooperative fulfills its task of meeting the needs of the working people, and it almost completely manages the local commerce.

    Now the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the Mongolian People's Republic has a total of 260,000 members, and the capital invested reaches 4.5 million Tugriks. There are 10,000 skilled workers working in the cooperative organs, including specialists such as economists, commodity specialists, and financial experts. Compared with 1921, the number of experts has increased thirty-four times.

    Due to the achievements of the working people of our country in production and the help of the great Soviet Union, the total amount of commodities has increased a lot, and the commodity circulation has also expanded. In our country, almost 60% of the retail trade is operated by the Supply and Marketing Cooperative. In 1955, the cooperative's turnover rate of goods increased by 42.6% compared with 1952, which has exceeded the average annual turnover rate of goods stipulated in the second five-year plan (1953-1957).

    Due to the measures taken by the Party and the government, the material and cultural welfare of the people is improving year by year, and the purchasing power of the people is increasing. This provides a strong guarantee for the development of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative.

    The Supply and Marketing Cooperative is fully responsible for the task of purchasing livestock raw materials. The labor initiative and enthusiasm of livestock breeders, and their patriotic attitude towards purchasing work, are of decisive significance for the success of this great work.

    The guiding role of the Party and the increasing assistance of the great Soviet Union are reliable guarantees for our further success.

    According to the provisions of the second five-year plan, the sales volume of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative system will increase by 35% in five years. This plan is being successfully implemented.

    From the above, it can be seen that the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of our country has been and is playing an important role in expanding the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and supplying the needs of the people. However, there are still some shortcomings in our work, which are mainly manifested in the unreasonable distribution of goods, untimely transportation, and the failure of some cooperatives to complete tasks in a timely manner in purchasing work. Now we are working hard to correct these shortcomings in order to further develop the supply and marketing cooperative cause in our country. (Special contribution to this newspaper.

    蒙古人民共和国供销合作社的发展
    蒙古人民共和国供销合作社中央理事会副主席  德·多尔日果托勃
    蒙古人民共和国供销合作社是我国的最大的社会团体之一，它表明人民在发展自己的经济方面的巨大的成就。蒙古供销合作社的目的是尽量满足人民不断增长的物质和文化需要，正确利用畜牧业产品，保证国家的工业和输出的需要。
    蒙古人民共和国供销合作社的继续不断的发展是蒙古人民革命党正确领导的结果，是伟大的苏联经常无私的援助的结果。
    在1921年人民革命以前，蒙古是外国资本家竞争的场所，是他们的市场。掌握政权的世俗封建主和宗教封建主不止一次地出卖了民族的利益，充当外国资本家手中的顺从的工具。
    资本家和高利贷者在蒙古人民内部敌人的帮助下，骑在劳动人民的脖子上，阻碍国家的进一步发展。在这个时期，国家没有自己的工业，而畜牧业是用最原始的方法经营的。
    这给外国资本家、高利贷者以广泛渗入的可能，他们为所欲为地从事毫不掩盖的掠夺人民的行为。例如，在1918—1919年，库伦（现在的乌兰巴托）和其他地点出现了一些外国银行的分行。这些银行发行纸币，横暴地掠夺金矿，用极贱的价钱购买各种用作原料的最重要的农产品，用债务和利息残害牧民。蒙古封建主欠外国资本家的债务共约二千万美元。例如，科布多的封建主必须给中国商行缴纳七万五千匹马、四十万头牛、五万五千匹骆驼、五十万只绵羊和山羊。
    当时在这个艾马克（省）牧民手中的牲畜总共只相当于这些债务的60％—70％。因此，牧民虽然也有数量不多的牲畜，实际上是被剥夺了。封建主为了偿付资本家的某些债务，一年几次地向牧民征收税款。
    1921年的人民革命推翻了内外敌人的统治，在我国人民面前开辟了尽量发展国家的国民经济和文化的广泛的可能性。最初几年摆在人民政府面前的一个迫切的任务是建立民族商业，把外国商行从自己的市场中排挤出去。
    由苏赫·巴托尔和乔巴山领导的蒙古人民革命党和政府，根据弗·伊·列宁的学说和指示，决定建立供销合作社。1921年9月24日我国开始建立供销合作社。在开始的时候，供销合作社销售了一万五千图格里克（蒙古币）的商品，购买了四万四千图格里克的原料。很快地在各县都建立了基层合作社。在人民政权最初几年间，合作社企业遭受到阶级敌人——被推翻的封建主阶级的代表、资本主义分子和其他一些人——的不小的抗拒。但是，在党的领导下，供销合作社粉碎了敌人的抗拒，发展成为群众性的组织之一。
    在伟大的苏联的直接帮助下，合作社企业开始顺利地解决摆在自己面前的任务。
    党帮助许多供销合作社清洗了敌人、破坏分子和怠工分子，继续在组织上和经济上巩固了这个组织。在这方面，建立工商银行，发行民族货币，取消对外国商行的债务，具有特别的意义。这些措施清楚地证明蒙古人民坚决地执行了使国家沿着非资本主义道路发展的方针。
    到1940年，蒙古人民共和国的供销合作社共有十万以上的社员。我国约从1940年开始了社会主义革命时期。这更加提高了供销合作社在建成社会主义基础的事业中的作用。
    供销合作社在执行自己积极参加实现第一个五年计划（1948—1952）的任务的义务中获得了极大的成就。
    我们的供销合作社是在自愿原则上建立起来的社会团体，它在自己的社员的直接参加下实现自己的销售商品和收购原料的职能。它根据合作社的社章独立地经营自己的业务。
    供销合作社执行自己满足劳动人民的需要的任务，当地的商业差不多完全由它来经营。
    现在蒙古人民共和国的供销合作社共有二十六万社员，入社的资金达到四百五十万图格里克。在合作社机关工作的有一万名熟练的工作人员，其中有经济学家、商品学家、财政学家等专门人才。和1921年相比，专家的数目增加了三十四倍。
    由于我国劳动人民在生产上的成就和伟大的苏联的帮助，商品总量增加了很多，商品流转也扩大起来了。在我国差不多60％的零售商业由供销合作社经营。1955年合作社的货物周转率比1952年提高了42.6％，已经超过了第二个五年计划（1953—1957）规定的每年货物的平均周转率。
    由于党和政府所采取的措施，人民的物质和文化福利一年一年地在改善，人民的购买力在提高。这就为供销合作社的发展提供了有力的保证。
    供销合作社完全担负起收购牧畜原料的任务。牲畜饲养者的劳动主动性和积极性，他们对待收购工作的爱国主义态度，对这一巨大工作的成功有着决定性的意义。
    党的指导作用，伟大的苏联的日益增多的帮助是我们进一步成功的可靠保证。
    根据第二个五年计划的规定，五年内供销合作社系统的商品销售额将增加35％。这个计划正在顺利地执行中。
    从上面可以看到，我国的供销合作社对于扩大城乡物资交流和供应人民需要方面已经和正在发挥重要的作用。但是，我们的工作中也还存在着一些缺点，这主要表现在分配货物不合理、运输不及时以及有些合作社在收购工作中不能及时完成任务等。现在我们正在为纠正这些缺点以进一步发展我国的供销合作事业而努力。（本报特约稿。张佐华译）
