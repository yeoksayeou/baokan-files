    Appropriately Increase Forestry Coverage
    Readers rarely see reports about forestry in the People's Daily. When there are articles, they are mostly about forestry policies. Reports about the production and life of forestry workers are almost never seen. I suggest that newspapers should appropriately increase reports about forestry production and the activities of people on the forestry production front in the future. (Wang Haizong)

    适当增加林业方面的报道
    读者很少看到人民日报刊登林业方面的报道，偶尔有一两篇也是有关林业政策的。至于林区职工的生产、生活等方面的报道，却几乎看不见。我建议今后报纸对林业生产、对林业生产战线上的人的活动的报道要适当地增加。（王海宗）
