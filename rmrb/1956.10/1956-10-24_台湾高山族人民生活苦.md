Xinhua News Agency, October 20th: According to reports, Lian Zhendong, the "Director of the Department of Civil Affairs" of the Chiang Kai-shek Group in Taiwan Province, recently inspected Hualien and Taitung counties for three days. He also witnessed the tragic lives of the Gaoshan people in Taiwan, who were suffering from hunger and cold.

Taiwanese newspapers reported that on October 6, Lian Zhendong arrived in Futian Village, Guangfu Township, Hualien County, where the Amis people live. The village's water conservancy facilities have been in disrepair for years, but there is no money to repair them. Hundreds of hectares of paddy fields have become barren dry land due to lack of irrigation, plunging the lives of all the Amis people in the village into misery. The farmers in this village are also exploited by usurious loans.

    台湾高山族人民生活苦
    据新华社20日讯　蒋介石集团台湾省“民政厅厅长”连震东最近到花莲、台东两县巡视了三天，他也看到了台湾高山族人民过着饥寒交迫的悲惨生活。
    台湾报纸说，连震东在10月6日到了花莲县光复乡富田村，那里聚居着阿美族的人民。这个村子的水利设施都年久失修了，但又没有钱修理。几百公顷的水田都因缺水灌溉而变成了贫瘠的旱田，使全村阿美族人民的生活都陷入了苦境。这个村子的农民还受高利贷剥削。
