Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 27th: TASS reports from Moscow on the 27th: On the 26th, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the French Embassy in the Soviet Union, replying to the French government's note to the Soviet government on October 10th regarding the West German government's memorandum of September 2nd.

In its note, the French government expressed that the division of Germany should be ended. It hoped that the Soviet government would pay attention to West Germany's memorandum and express its opinion on the issue of restoring German unity.

In its note, the Soviet government pointed out that it had reiterated in its reply to the West German government that it consistently advocated the reunification of Germany into a peaceful and democratic country, and that the Soviet Union's efforts to resolve the German question were precisely to achieve this goal. However, the most important agreements between the four powers on the German question were undermined by the unilateral actions of the U.S., Britain, and France that caused the division of Germany.

The Soviet note addressed the Western countries' proposal, mentioned by France, at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference held in the autumn of 1955 regarding the simultaneous ending of Germany's division and the establishment of a European security system. It stated that the Soviet government had already presented its views on this issue and had forcefully demonstrated that the proposals put forward by the Western three countries at the conference on the German question were not in line with the current reality of Germany, and therefore did not conform to the interests of ensuring European security.

The Soviet government emphasized that just as there was a growing desire in the international community for cooperation, a demand to find ways to universally reduce armaments, and further ease international tensions, the West German government was accelerating the establishment of the largest regular army in Western Europe, refusing to discuss proposals to limit armed forces, and suppressing the basic democratic rights and freedoms of West German residents. Under these circumstances, the Soviet government considered it necessary to once again urge the French government to pay attention to the fact that the revival of West German militarism was a serious threat to Europe and an obstacle to the establishment of a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany.

The Soviet government pointed out in its note that the current political policy of the West German government had dangerous consequences, and also pointed out that suggestions that did not consider the existence of two independent German states would not lead to a solution to the German question, because under the current circumstances, the only way to unify Germany was for the two Germanys to get closer, reach mutual understanding, and negotiate with each other.

The Soviet government reiterated that it was willing to promote contact between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to facilitate German unification, and also hoped that the French government, as well as the U.S. and British governments, would also acknowledge the necessity of promoting rapprochement between the two Germanys, which would be a significant contribution to the cause of German unity.

On the same day, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs also sent notes with the same content to the U.S. and British governments.

### 苏联在给法国的复照中再次表示  促进东西德接触才能导致德国统一  希望法美英三国承认有必要采取这种做法

    苏联在给法国的复照中再次表示
    促进东西德接触才能导致德国统一
    希望法美英三国承认有必要采取这种做法
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科27日讯：苏联外交部26日交给法国驻苏联大使馆一件照会，答复法国政府在10月10日就西德政府9月2日的备忘录致苏联政府的照会。
    法国政府在它的照会中表示应当结束德国的分裂状态。它希望苏联政府重视西德的备忘录，并且就恢复德国统一问题表示意见。
    苏联政府在照会中指出，它在给西德政府的答复中已经重申：它一贯主张德国重新统一为和平民主的国家，而苏联谋求解决德国问题的努力也正是为了达到这个目的。然而四国有关德国问题的最重要的协议遭到美英法三国政府引起德国分裂的片面行动的破坏。
    苏联照会谈到法国所提到的西方国家在1955年秋季举行的四国外长会议上提出的关于结束德国分裂状态和建立欧洲安全体系同时进行的建议。它说，苏联政府已经陈述过它对这个问题的看法，并且有力地证明，西方三国在会上就德国问题提出的建议与德国当前实际情况不符，因而也不符合保障欧洲安全的利益。
    苏联政府着重指出：正当在国际上大家希望合作、要求设法普遍裁减军备、进一步缓和国际紧张局势的愿望日益强烈的时候，西德政府却加速建立西欧最大的正规军，拒绝商谈限制武装力量的建议，并且压制西德居民的起码的民主权利和自由。在这种情况下，苏联政府认为有必要再一次促请法国政府注意，西德军国主义的复活对欧洲是一种严重的威胁，是建立一个统一、和平、民主的德国的障碍。
    苏联政府在照会中指出，现在的西德政府的政治方针具有危险的后果，同时指出，这种不考虑有两个独立的德国存在这一事实的建议不会导致德国问题的解决，因为在目前情况下，要统一德国，除了两个德国接近、互相取得谅解、彼此进行谈判以外，别无其他道路。
    苏联政府重申，它愿意促进德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国建立接触以利于德国的统一，同时也希望法国政府以及美国和英国政府方面也承认有必要促成两个德国的接近，这将是对德国统一事业的重大贡献。
    苏联外交部在同一天还把内容相同的照会分送给美国和英国政府。
