　　"Combine Harbors to Build Sluice Gates, Benefiting Qidong: Drawing Water for Drought Resistance, Blocking Tides and Draining Floods"
    Completion of the Binggang Sluice Gate Project in Qidong County

    (Our Dispatch) The Binggang Sluice Gate Project in Qidong County, Jiangsu Province, has been successfully completed. Qidong County, bordering the river and the sea, has twenty-one ports entering the Yangtze River, which have now been merged into five. Five reinforced concrete sluice gates have been built, controlling floods and turning water disasters into water conservancy.

    Over the years, the coastal areas of Qidong County have often been hit by floods, causing disasters. Tidal water flows inward, silt settles, and river ports become silted up, which hinders traffic and prevents drainage. More than 50,000 mu of fertile land suffer from waterlogging and crop failure every year. Hundreds of thousands of man-days are spent on repairing dikes and dredging rivers, but the fundamental problem cannot be solved.

    After liberation, the People's Government formulated a plan to combine ports and build sluice gates, which started construction in October 1954. This kind of port combination and sluice gate construction project can save a lot of expenses compared to building a sluice gate in each port. Now the project has been fully completed. From now on, the people of Qidong will be forever free from the threat of floods, and in dry years, water can be drawn for irrigation. It can also develop waterway transportation, and sideline production such as fish farming and water chestnut cultivation. The labor saved from dredging rivers can be invested in agricultural and sideline production. According to estimates in the Jianghai area, after the port combination and sluice gate construction, the country can increase grain production by more than 800,000 jin per year. This is truly a great event in the history of Qidong, which has never happened before. During the construction period, local people automatically sent tea and water to the construction workers, and various agencies and units sent people to the construction site to visit and express their condolences. Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Feng Zhongyun, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources, and others, wrote inscriptions on the sluice gate to express their congratulations.

    President Guo Moruo's inscription reads: "Farmland water conservancy has been valued since ancient times. Combining ports and building sluice gates benefits Qidong, drawing water for drought resistance, blocking tides and draining floods. The lower reaches of the Yangtze River shine with brilliant light." (Fan Yuanyuan)

　　“并港建闸，泽被启东，引水抗旱，挡潮排洪”
    启东县并港建闸工程完工
    本报讯　江苏省启东县并港建闸工程已经胜利完工。启东县滨江临海，有二十一条入江港口，现在并成五条，建设了五个钢筋水泥的闸门，控制了洪水，把水灾变成了水利。
    历年来，启东县沿江地区常常被洪水袭击成灾，潮汐内灌，泥沙下淀，河港淤塞，既阻碍交通，又无法排水，五万多亩良田年年受涝失收，每年有几十万人工致力于修堤浚河，还是不能解决根本问题。
    解放以后，人民政府制定了并港建闸的计划，自1954年10月开始动工。这种并港建闸工程比在每个港口建一个闸，可以节省大量开支。现在工程已经全部完工。从此以后启东人民永远摆脱了洪水的威胁，旱年又可以引水灌溉。还可以发展水路交通，和养鱼、栽菱等副业生产，省下来的浚河劳力可以投入农副业生产。据江海区估计，并港建闸以后，每年可以为国家增产粮食八十多万斤。这真是启东历史上从未有过的一件大喜事，兴工期间，当地群众自动地给建筑工人送茶送水，各机关、单位都曾派人去工地参观慰问。全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄、中国科学院院长郭沫若、水利部副部长冯仲云等，都在水闸上题了词，表示祝贺。
    郭沫若院长的题词写道：“农田水利、自古所重，并港建闸，泽被启东，引水抗旱，挡潮排洪，长江下游，荦荦光锋。”（樊玉媛）
