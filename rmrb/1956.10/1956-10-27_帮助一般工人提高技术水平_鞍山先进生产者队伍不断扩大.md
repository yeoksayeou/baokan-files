Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 25th: In Anshan City, many advanced producers have united with and assisted ordinary workers to reach the level of advanced producers. The number of advanced producers in various units throughout the city has increased from more than 10,400 in the first quarter to more than 12,000.

    Many units under the Anshan Metallurgical Construction General Company, such as the No. 2 Mine, Rolling Mill, Electrical Installation Engineering Company, and the Ansteel No. 3 Machine Repair Workshop, have universally promoted mutual assistance and learning contracts in the advanced producer movement to help ordinary teams and individuals improve their production and construction levels. For example, Leng Jinyu, the steel bar foreman of the Steelmaking Construction Engineering Company, found the reasons why Dong Xintao's team often failed to complete tasks through specific investigation and analysis, and helped them establish a technical learning system, which improved their technical level. As a result, since the second quarter of this year, Dong Xintao's team has been able to over fulfill the state plan by an average of more than 40% every month.

    However, advanced producers did not have smooth sailing when uniting and helping ordinary workers. For example, Zhang Yongjiang's team of the Rolling Mill Construction Engineering Company was rejected when they helped Li Chunrong's team improve their digging work. At that time, the workers of Li Chunrong's team believed that digging only required strength, and there was no experience to learn. Later, Zhang Yongjiang's team guided Li Chunrong's team in many ways, and conducted a competition digging the same soil under the same conditions. Li Chunrong's team used the old method of two people loading the basket and two people carrying it, and the whole team of ten people worked for eight hours, each person sweating profusely. When they calculated in the evening, they had only dug 21 cubic meters of soil. Zhang Yongjiang's team adopted a new method of using iron plates as a base, with one person loading the basket and two people carrying the soil. The whole team of twelve people dug 86 cubic meters of soil in eight hours. After calculation, each member of Li Chunrong's team earned only 80 cents on average, while each member of Zhang Yongjiang's team earned more than three yuan. From that time on, the thinking that there was nothing to learn from physical labor changed among the workers of Li Chunrong's team. They learned Zhang Yongjiang's experience of digging three shovels per meter and the method of two people carrying soil side by side in sync, and increased from only being able to complete 50% of the quota in the past to exceeding the quota by 40% every month.

### 帮助一般工人提高技术水平  鞍山先进生产者队伍不断扩大

    帮助一般工人提高技术水平
    鞍山先进生产者队伍不断扩大
    新华社鞍山25日电　鞍山市许多先进生产者团结和帮助一般工人达到了先进生产者的水平。全市各单位的先进生产者，已经从第一季度的一万零四百多人扩大到一万二千多人。
    鞍山冶金建筑总公司所属第二矿山、轧钢、电气安装工程公司，以及鞍钢第三机修车间等许多单位，在先进生产者运动中普遍推行了互助互学合同，帮助一般小组和个人提高生产建设水平。如炼钢建筑工程公司钢筋工长冷进玉，通过具体的调查分析，找到董信涛小组经常完不成任务的原因，并且帮助他们建立技术学习制度，提高了技术水平。这样，董信涛小组自今年第二季度以来到现在，平均每月都能超额完成国家计划40％以上。
    但是先进生产者在团结帮助一般工人的时候，并不是一帆风顺的。如轧钢建筑工程公司张永江小组在帮助李春荣小组提高挖土工作的时候，就遭到拒绝。当时李春荣小组的工人认为：挖土只要用力气，没有什么经验可学的。后来，张永江小组从多方面对李春荣小组加以引导，并且在同样的条件下挖同样的土作了一次竞赛。李春荣小组用老办法两人装筐两人抬，全组十个人干了八小时，累得每个人汗珠直淌，到晚一计算才挖了二十一方土；张永江小组采用铁板垫底、一人装筐两人抬土的新方法，全组十二人八小时挖了八十六方土。一算账，李春荣小组每人平均只得八角钱，张永江小组每人得到三元多。从那时候起，李春荣小组工人认为力气活没啥可学的思想就转变了。他们学习了张永江的三锹一公尺挖土法和两人并肩同步抬土法的经验，由过去只能完成定额的50％，提高到每月超过定额40％。
