Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, October 10th: A large quantity of Sichuan Province's local specialties, such as galla chinensis, raw lacquer, white wax, and rosin, are on the market. By the end of September, the province had purchased over 7,000 dan of white wax, an increase of more than one-third compared to last year. The purchase of galla chinensis and raw lacquer also exceeded last year's figures, and some galla chinensis and raw lacquer have already been supplied to other provinces or made available for export.

This year, state-owned trading companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in Sichuan Province have increased the purchase prices of raw lacquer and galla chinensis, and assisted agricultural cooperatives in rationally arranging labor, encouraging farmers to collect, and sending people to guide farmers in cutting raw lacquer.
