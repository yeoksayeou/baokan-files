    "Once upon a time, there was a lonely young man named…", the mythological play "Clever Wife" recently staged by the China Children's Theatre in Beijing begins like many widely circulated folk tales.
    A young man named Zhuang Min returned from chopping firewood in the mountains, carrying a load to sell at the market outside the city gate. What an interesting place: all kinds of merchants, a constant stream of travelers, and street performers, people gathering and chatting. Suddenly, a shrill horn sounded from the city wall, instantly dispersing the laughter of the market crowd and bringing a mournful atmosphere. People whispered softly: the emperor is going to kill again. The emperor wanted to wear a dragon robe that was rare to find on earth. Many young women were captured to embroider the dragon robe, but none satisfied the emperor, and they were killed one after another. Now, another young mother has met her doom; people sent off this innocent victim with sympathetic eyes. Everyone was thinking: If only there were a clever wife who could embroider a dragon robe. An old painter who came from a very, very far place, in order to relieve people's suffering, immediately painted a beautiful and capable clever wife and sold the painting to Zhuang Min. The clever wife in the painting came to the world in the ardent expectation of people. After that, dear readers, I won't say it, you can guess: the clever wife and Zhuang Min got married and lived diligently; the emperor's minister came to find her, and the clever wife, with the help of the Bird Fairy, embroidered the dragon robe; however, the emperor, wearing the dragon robe, was still not satisfied and insisted on forcibly taking the clever wife as his concubine. At this time, the Immortal appeared, and suddenly the sky turned dark, and the seawater rolled out, submerging the palace, swallowing the emperor, and rescuing the kind-hearted victims. The Immortal led the clever wife and Zhuang Min, and at sunrise, sailed in a dragon boat towards a beautiful, ideal world. This is a moving story. In the past, people boldly created this "Clever Wife" full of bright prospects and hope in endless suffering; people unconsciously felt from it what is good and what is evil; what is love and what is hate!
    I love the clever wife in this script. She is our imagined beautiful fairy, and she is also a thrifty, kind, and willing to help others, a common person with flesh and blood. She bravely agreed to embroider the dragon robe, wanting to relieve the suffering of countless kind people. The clever wife entered the hearts of the audience in this way, especially the hearts of the children, becoming a credible and beloved ideal figure in people's hearts.
    The singing and dancing "Clever Wife" radiates the rich fragrance of our national art. I not only love the clever wife in the script, but I also love the clever wife created by the young actress Xu Xiaohui. She is like the ancient Chinese girl I often imagine; I seem to have seen her there, no, I see traces of her in many of today's girls. When she was still the clever wife in the painting, she was so delicate and charming, so light and ethereal; her gestures and eyes seemed to be telling something. In this young and talented actress, I saw the brilliance emanating from the traditional opera performing arts.
    The simple, clear, but stylish stage art design adds a lot of color to the attractive "Clever Wife". We seem to have stepped into a noisy and bustling market, and we seem to have returned to the remote mountain valleys, to the quiet bamboo forest cottage; there is also the gloomy and cold palace, the magnificent palace with distant pavilions and nearby vermilion corridors that looks like a watercolor painting and a real landscape, and the earth-shattering and surging waves, the gold-edged floating clouds, and the patterned, grouped bamboo leaves…further rendering the fascinating flavor of the myth.
    I can't help but think, what makes the "Clever Wife" on stage so attractive to the audience? I think there is only one answer: it is the unique artistic charm of its folk art tradition. A child sitting next to me said: "Clever Wife" is really good! It would be even better if the singing were better." I think this comment is very reasonable. (Attached picture)

    “巧媳妇”可好哪
    雪拉
    “从前，有一个孤苦零丁的小伙子，他的名字叫……”，中国儿童剧院最近在北京上演的神话剧“巧媳妇”，就是像许多民间广泛流传的故事一样开始的。
    青年小伙子庄民从山上砍柴回来，挑着一担柴来到城门前的市集上卖。多么有趣的地方呵：各式各样做买卖的人，穿流不息的行路人，还有那跑江湖的卖艺人，人们在这里聚会、谈笑。突然，城头上发出了凄厉的号角声，顿时驱散了集市上人群的欢笑，带来哀伤的气氛。人们轻轻地低语：皇帝又要杀人了。皇帝要穿一件人间难得的龙袍，不少青年妇女被捉去绣龙袍，总是不如皇帝的意，一个个被杀了。现在，又有一个年轻的妈妈遭到厄运；人们用同情的眼光送走了这个无辜的被害者。大家在想：要是能有一个绣出龙袍的巧媳妇该多好。一位从很远很远的地方来到这里的卖画翁，他为要解除人们的灾难，当场画出了一个美丽、能干的巧媳妇，并且把这幅画卖给了庄民。画中的巧媳妇在人们这样殷切期待的愿望中来到人间。之后呢，亲爱的读者，我不说，你也会猜得出来：巧媳妇和庄民成了亲，两个人勤勤恳恳地过日子；皇帝的大臣找来了，巧媳妇得到鸟仙的帮助绣好了龙袍；可是，穿上了龙袍的皇帝还不满足，硬要强占巧媳妇作他的妃子。这时，仙翁出现了，顿时天昏地暗，海水滚滚地流了出来，淹没了宫殿，吞没了皇帝，也救出了善良的被害的人们。仙翁领着巧媳妇和庄民，在红日东升的时候，驾着龙舟驶向美好的、理想的世界。这是一个动人的故事。人们在过去说不尽的苦难中，大胆地创造了这个充满着光明前途和希望的“巧媳妇”；人们在不知不觉中，又从它感受到什么是善，什么是恶；什么是爱，什么又是恨！
    我喜爱这个剧本中的巧媳妇。她是我们想像中的美丽的仙女，她又是一个勤俭可亲、愿意帮助别人的有血有肉的普通人。她勇敢地答应去绣龙袍，是想为无数善良的人们解除痛苦。巧媳妇就是这样进到观众的心中，特别是儿童观众的心中，成为人们心中可信的、爱戴的理想人物。
    载歌载舞的“巧媳妇”放射出了我们民族艺术浓郁的芬芳。我不仅仅喜爱剧本中的巧媳妇，我更爱的是年轻的演员徐小慧所创造出来的巧媳妇。她像我常常想像的中国古代少女；我好像在那里见过她，不，我在许许多多今天的少女中又看到她的痕迹。当她还是画中的巧媳妇，她是那样娇美多姿，那样轻盈、飘然；她的手势和眼神就像在诉说什么。在这个年轻的、有才能的演员身上，我看到了传统的戏曲表演艺术发散出的光彩。
    简洁、明了，但又富有风格的舞台美术设计为诱人的“巧媳妇”增添了不少色彩。我们像是走进了喧闹、嘈杂的市集，我们又像是回到了山坳坳里，幽静的竹林的小屋中；还有那阴惨惨的冷宫，那又像水彩画、又像真正的景致的远处的亭台楼阁和近处的朱红回廊的金碧辉煌的宫殿，还有那翻天复地滚滚涌来的海浪，那镶着金边的朵朵浮云，那图案式的、一组组的竹叶……更是渲染了神话的迷人风味。
    我禁不住想着，是什么使得舞台上的“巧媳妇”这样吸引住观众？我想，只有一个回答：就是它那特有的民间艺术传统的艺术魅力。我邻座的一个小朋友这样说：“巧媳妇”可好哪，要是唱得好一些，就好了。我觉得这句评语是很有道理的。（附图片）
