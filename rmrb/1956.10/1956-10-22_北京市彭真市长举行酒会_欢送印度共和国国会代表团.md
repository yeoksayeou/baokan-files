Xinhua News Agency, October 21st. Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen held a reception tonight to bid farewell to the parliamentary delegation of the Republic of India, which is about to leave Beijing to return home.

　　Mayor Peng Zhen accompanied the distinguished guests to meet people from all walks of life in Beijing. In the brightly lit hall, the conversations of the hosts and guests could be heard constantly.

　　During the banquet, delegation leader A. Ayyangar told Mayor Peng Zhen that if we learned each other's languages, it would be difficult to distinguish who is Chinese and who is Indian. Mayor Peng Zhen stood up and said to all those present that what Speaker Ayyangar had just said was very correct, our thoughts, feelings, and spirits have long been combined together. Peng Zhen said that our histories and thoughts are very similar, and it is difficult to distinguish whether it is Chinese or Indian from the perspectives of philosophy, culture, or art. He said humorously: I don't think it matters if we don't distinguish it, because we have already become a family.

　　Peng Zhen added that this visit by the delegation has deepened the understanding between our two countries and developed the friendship between the two countries, for which we express our gratitude. Finally, he heartily congratulated India on its prosperity, strength, and happiness, as well as the further strengthening and development of cooperation and mutual assistance between China and India.

　　In his speech, delegation leader A. Ayyangar expressed his complete agreement with Mayor Peng Zhen's statement that China and India have become a family. He said that China and India are like two rivers merging together, and it is very difficult to distinguish them. A. Ayyangar then specifically pointed out the similarities between the two countries in terms of people's lives, culture, art, architecture, customs, and national characteristics. He also said: We should not only be proud of the friendly cooperation we have achieved today, but also for the continuous achievements in the future. He listed historical facts of China and India over the past century and explained: "Our happiness will be the same, and our past misfortunes are also the same."

　　A. Ayyangar pointed out that the struggles of the people of China and India have achieved victory, but our work cannot stop halfway, we must continue to work hard to help Asian and African countries still under colonial rule gain independence.

　　He also pointed out that we should not ignore that there are indeed people in the world who do not like our two countries being together. However, the facts have determined that we must be together. He congratulated the friendship between China and India on behalf of the delegation and the Indian people for its eternal consolidation.

　　Indian Ambassador to China R.K. Nehru and his wife were invited to attend the reception.

    北京市彭真市长举行酒会
    欢送印度共和国国会代表团
    新华社21日讯　北京市长彭真今晚举行酒会，为行将离开北京回国的印度共和国国会代表团饯行。
    彭真市长陪同贵宾们同北京各界人士见面。灯光辉煌的大厅里，不断传出宾主们的谈话声。
    席间，代表团团长阿·阿延加尔向彭真市长谈到，如果我们学会了彼此的语言，就很难分别哪是中国人、哪是印度人了。彭真市长起立向全体到会者说，议长先生刚才谈得很对，我们的思想、感情和精神早就结合在一起了。彭真说，我们的历史和思想很相似，无论从哲学、文化、艺术哪方面来看，都难分出是中国的还是印度的。他很有风趣地说：我看不分它也可以，因为我们已经成为一家人。
    彭真又说，代表团这次访问加深了我们两国间的了解，发展了两国间的友谊，对此我们表示感谢。最后，他衷心地祝贺印度的富强、繁荣和幸福以及进一步加强和发展中印两国间的合作互助。
    阿·阿延加尔团长在讲话时，表示完全同意彭真市长刚才所说的中印两国已成一家人。他说，中印两国，就像两股河流合在一起一样，要区别出它们是很困难的。阿·阿延加尔接着从中印两国的人民生活、文化、艺术、建筑、风俗习惯和民族特性等方面具体地指出了两国的相同之处。他又说：我们不仅要为今天，而且要为今后不断取得友好合作而感到骄傲。他列举了中印两国近百年来的历史事实并且说明：“我们的幸福将是一样，而我们过去的不幸也是相同的。”
    阿·阿延加尔指出，中印两国人民的斗争已取得胜利，但是我们的工作不能中途停止，必须继续努力，帮助亚洲、非洲的还在殖民统治中的国家获得独立。
    他并且指出，我们不应忽视世界上确实有人不喜欢我们两国在一起。但是，事实已决定了我们必须在一起。他代表代表团和印度人民祝贺中印两国的友谊永远巩固。
    印度驻中国大使拉·库·尼赫鲁和夫人应邀出席了酒会。
    出席今晚酒会的，还有全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长沈钧儒、陈叔通和部分委员，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席章伯钧和部分常务委员、委员，国防委员会副主席张治中、傅作义，外交部副部长章汉夫和政府其他有关各部门负责人，中国驻印度大使潘自力，北京市副市长张友渔、吴晗、冯基平、程宏毅、贾庭三、乐松生，中国人民政治协商会议北京市委员会主席刘仁和各副主席，北京市政府各部门和各人民团体负责人以及各界人士。
