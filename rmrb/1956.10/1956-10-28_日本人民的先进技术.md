    Advanced Technology of the Japanese People
    Zimu
    The Japanese commodity exhibition in Beijing has aroused great interest among our engineering and technical personnel.
    A total of seven machine tools are on display this time. Among them, the more advanced ones are the AC16 copying lathe, the 4R hexagonal lathe, and the MF70 vertical milling machine. According to Japanese friends, these machine tools were all designed by themselves. For example, the spindle speed of the AC16 copying lathe can be adjusted from 1,000 to 2,000 revolutions per minute, so high-speed cutting can be performed; the working process of the lathe, such as loading, clamping, tightening, and unloading, is automated. The cutting mechanism of the lathe uses hydraulic copying, which, although not an advanced method, is still very suitable for mass production; it is particularly worth mentioning that the lathe is designed very well in terms of safe operation. The 4R hexagonal lathe uses an electric speed change method, and the spindle can obtain 24 speeds from 38 to 2,000 revolutions, which is more convenient than using a DC motor. The feed range of the hexagonal head is from 0.025 mm to 2.4 mm per revolution, with a total of 21 levels. The transverse feed of the tool holder is from 0.025 mm to 1.2 mm per revolution, and the longitudinal feed is from 0.05 mm to 2.4 mm, each with 18 levels, so it is suitable for high-speed cutting.
    From these few machine tools, we can see that the manufacturing level of the Japanese people is also quite high. For example, the clearance between the lead screw and the nut is very small when shaking the lathe tool holder, and the noise and vibration of the gear transmission when working at high speed are small, which will ensure the machining accuracy of the machine tool to a certain extent; therefore, one worker can operate three machine tools, and it does not necessarily require senior technicians. However, some parts on the machine tools are still old-fashioned, such as the oil-cylinder type time relay, which has long been eliminated in other advanced countries.
    The 9M3 mobile air compressor driven by a diesel engine produced by Mitsui Seiki Kogyo Co., Ltd. weighs three tons in total and is small in size. Almost all of the lubricating oil in the exhaust gas can be recovered, so the fuel consumption is very low.
    In terms of construction and general machinery, a 5-ton vibrating road roller is worth noting. Because this type of road roller rolls and vibrates at the same time, the 5-ton static weight can actually produce 10 to 15 tons of rolling force, so it is not necessary to use heavy machinery uniformly, which can save a lot of metal materials.
    It can be seen from this exhibition that the technology of the Japanese machine manufacturing industry has a fairly high advanced level, especially in improving machine efficiency, saving metal materials (but using more copper), and enriching various machine types to meet the needs of all aspects. There are many new experiences; Japanese engineering and technical personnel have absorbed the world's advanced technology and combined it with Japan's natural environment, resource conditions, people's lives, and other specific conditions, and have given full play to their creativity, showing the unique style of the Japanese nation. Various machine products have the characteristics of being economical, practical, lightweight, and flexible. After the visit, people have a novel feeling. These are all worth learning for our country's mechanical industry engineering and technical personnel.

    日本人民的先进技术
    子木
    日本商品展览会在北京展出，引起我们工程技术人员很大兴趣。
    这次展出的工作母机共七台，其中比较先进的有AC16型仿形车床，4R型六角车床，MF70型立式铣床等，这些机床据日本友人谈都是自己设计的。如AC16型仿形车床的主轴转速每分钟可由一千转到二千转，因此可进行高速切削；车床的工作过程如装料、夹料、夹紧、卸料都是自动化的，车床的切削机构是采用液压仿形，虽然这还不是先进的方法，但在大批生产中应用还是很合适的；特别值得提出的是车床在安全操作方面设计得很完善。4R型六角车床是采用电变速的方法，主轴自三十八转到二千转可得到24种速度，这种方法比直流电动机来得方便；六角头的进刀范围为每转自0.025公厘至2.4公厘共二十一级，刀架的横进刀每转自0.025公厘到1.2公厘，纵向进刀自0.05公厘到2.4公厘各有十八级，所以适用于高速切削。
    从这几台机床可以见到日本人民的制造水平也是相当高的。如摇动车床刀架对丝杠和螺母间的间隙很少，在高速工作时齿轮变速箱的噪音和机床振动都较小，因而对机床的加工精度是会有一定保证的；也因此一个工人可以操纵三台机床，而且不一定需要高级技术工人。但机床上有些部件还是旧式的，如时间继电器还有用油筒式的，这在其他先进国家早被淘汰了。
    三井精机工业有限公司生产的柴油机带动的9M3移动式空气压缩机，全套重量三吨，体积较小，出气中的润滑油几乎极大部分可以收回，因此耗油量很低。
    建筑和通用机械方面有一个5?的振动式压路机是值得注意的，这种压路机因为一面滚动一面振动，5?的静重量实际上可以产生10到15?的滚压效力，因此就不一定一律要采用笨重机械，这样就可大量节约金属材料。
    从这次展览会上可以看出日本机器制造业的技术是具有相当高的先进水平，特别在提高机器效率，节约金属材料（但是铜用的较多）丰富各种机器品种以应各方面的需要，都有很多新的经验；日本的工程技术人员，在吸收世界先进技术并结合日本的自然环境、资源条件、人民生活等等具体情况，都发挥了自己的创造性，表现了日本民族的特有风格，各种机器产品都具备了经济实用，轻巧灵便的特点，参观后使人有新颖的感觉，这些都是值得我国机械工业工程技术人员学习的。
