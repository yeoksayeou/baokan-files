    Engineering Technicians Devise Plan to Eliminate Coal Pillars
    Liaoyuan Mining Bureau to Extract an Additional 15 Million Tons of Coal
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Liaoyuan Mining Bureau's engineering technicians recently proposed a plan to eliminate underground coal pillars in mines. Implementing this plan will reduce the loss of enormous coal resources for the nation.
    In the past, when mining coal, coal pillars had to be left between pits, between mining areas, and to protect the mine shafts, to isolate water and fire, prevent ground pressure, and ensure the safety of the mining area. The state also stipulated that these coal pillars were "safety coal pillars" and were not allowed to be mined. Therefore, nearly one-third of the coal was lost underground and could not be mined. In 1954, the Mining Bureau's engineering technicians put forward a suggestion to eliminate coal pillars. Over the past few years, under the guidance of Soviet experts and higher-level leading organs, many bold experiments have been carried out. Now, the coal pillars between mining areas and between the upper and lower coal seams, except those close to fire zones, are all ready for mining. At the pit entrances of Taixin, Fuguo, and Xi'an mines, the six coal pillars that have been eliminated have allowed the state to mine approximately 110,000 tons of additional coal. After the coal pillars are mined out, wood, sand, or the existing roof is grouted with yellow mud to replace them, which can still isolate water and fire and prevent pressure, ensuring the safe production of the mine. In July, the Mining Bureau had already made a preliminary plan to eliminate all coal pillars and formally arranged for the Xi'an Mine to implement it. Engineer Liu Liangxi of the Technical Section said that after these coal pillars are eliminated, the Liaoyuan Mining Bureau will be able to mine an additional 15 million tons or more of coal.
    The plan to eliminate coal pillars can not only increase coal production but also extend the life of the mine, reduce depreciation costs, and lower costs.

### 工程技术人员作出取消煤柱方案  辽源矿务局将多采一千五百万吨煤炭

    工程技术人员作出取消煤柱方案
    辽源矿务局将多采一千五百万吨煤炭
    本报讯　辽源矿务局的工程技术人员最近提出了取消矿井井下煤柱的方案，实现这个方案将可为国家减少巨量煤炭资源的损失。
    过去，在矿井采煤的时候，坑和坑之间、采区和采区之间，以及保护井筒，都要留一条煤，作为隔绝水、火，防止地压，保证采区安全的煤柱。国家也就规定这些煤柱为“安全煤柱”，是不允许开采的，因此，有近三分之一的煤量，就这样被损失在井下，无法开采。1954年，矿务局的工程技术人员，提出了取消煤柱的建议。几年来，在苏联专家和上级领导机关的指导下，作过许多次大胆的试验。现在，采区之间和煤层上下之间的煤柱，除接近火区的外，都已经具备开采条件。在太信、富国、西安等矿的坑口，已经取消的六个煤柱，给国家多采煤炭大约十一万吨。煤柱被采出以后，利用木板、砂子或者用原有的顶板灌黄泥浆等办法来代替，仍可隔绝水、火和防止压力，保证矿井安全生产。7月份，矿务局已经作出取消全部煤柱的初步方案，正式向西安矿布置执行。技术处刘亮熙工程师说，取消这些煤柱后，辽源矿务局将可多采出煤炭约一千五百万吨以上。
    取消煤柱的方案，不仅能提高出煤量，还能延长矿井寿命，减低折旧费用和降低成本。
