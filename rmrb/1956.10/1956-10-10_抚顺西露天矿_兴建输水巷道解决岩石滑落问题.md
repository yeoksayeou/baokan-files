Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 8th October: The Fushun West Open-Pit Mine has recently started work on a rockslide control project; the rockslide problem in the mining area, which has been unsolvable for decades, will now be fundamentally solved.

　　The West Open-Pit Mine is the largest coal producer in Fushun. Rockslide disasters have occurred since the mine was first exploited during the Japanese imperialist occupation. By the early days of liberation, the area of rockslides in the mining area had reached more than 2,000 meters in length, and the rock that had slid down amounted to more than 13 million cubic meters. Like a small mountain, it horizontally pressed in the middle of the open-pit mine that was being mined, dividing a complete open-pit mine in half, making it impossible to mine more than 5 million tons of coal. The West Open-Pit Mine uses a lot of manpower to clean it up every year, but the cleaned-up area is always quickly reburied by the rocks that have slid down again.

　　Soviet experts who helped our country build coal mines first clarified the geological and hydrological conditions of the West Open-Pit Mine and discovered that the cause of the rockslides was due to the infiltration of the upper-level water. Therefore, they proposed to build a large water diversion tunnel in the upper part of the mining area to fundamentally solve the rockslide problem, while continuing to clear the rock pressing on the mining area with light machinery. In this way, the rockslide problem can be fundamentally solved in a few years, and more than 500,000 tons of coal can be extracted every year during the treatment process.

    抚顺西露天矿
　　兴建输水巷道解决岩石滑落问题
    新华社抚顺8日电　抚顺西露天矿处理岩石滑落工程已在最近动工；几十年来无法解决的矿区岩石滑落问题，从此将可得到根本解决。
    西露天矿是抚顺产煤量最大的矿。从日本帝国主义侵占时期开始采这个矿时，就发生了岩石滑落灾害。到解放初期，矿区内岩石滑落的面积达二千多公尺长，滑落下来的岩石有一千三百多万立方公尺，像一座小山一样，横压在正在开采的露天矿中间，把一个完整的露天矿分成两半，使五百多万吨煤不能开采出来。西露天矿每年使用很大力量来清理，可是清理出的地方总是很快地又被滑落下的岩石重新掩埋起来。
    帮助我国建设煤矿的苏联专家，首先弄清了西露天矿的地质水文情况，发现岩石滑落的原因是由于上邦水渗透所引起的，因此提出在矿区上邦开凿一条大输水巷道，从根本上解决岩石滑落问题，一面用轻便机械继续清理压在矿区里的岩石。这样，岩石滑落问题就可以在几年内从根本上得到解决，在处理过程中每年还可以多采出五十多万吨煤。
