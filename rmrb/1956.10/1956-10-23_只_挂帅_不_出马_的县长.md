    The County Head Who Only "Commands" But Doesn't "Go into Battle"
    Editor:
    I am a secretary of a county People's Committee. Although I am a general staff member, I have a lot of contact with the county's leadership activities, so I have seen some problems. As a Party member, I have a responsibility to report these situations to the Party newspaper.
    Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province, originally had three county heads, but the work of the county People's Committee was not done well. The reason is that they are all members of the CPC County Committee, and all three are in charge of a specific task in the County Committee, but none of the county heads is in charge of the work of the People's Committee. Therefore, although there are three county heads, no one is responsible for the work that a real county head should do. It should be said that the task of the People's Committee of a large county with a population of more than 500,000 like Dongyang County is quite heavy, and it is impossible to do a good job in the leadership of the People's Committee without a county head worthy of the name. But in fact, the burden of this heavy leadership work of the People's Committee is placed on the shoulders of a deputy director of the office.
    The office of the county People's Committee receives a large number of documents, official letters, and letters from the special commissioner's office, the province, and even the State Council every month, but the county head rarely studies them, or even reads them, and completely hands them over to the office director to "approve" and handle. Even the most important documents, such as the decrees promulgated by the State Council, the resolutions and instructions of the Provincial People's Committee on spring plowing production, and the recently issued instructions on strengthening the production leadership and organizational construction of agricultural producers' cooperatives, are no exception. Therefore, the documents that should have been carefully studied by the county head before being handled are all approved by the office director to the "responsible" section or bureau for handling. The same is true for the documents issued by the county People's Committee; almost all of them are decided by the office director. Are these documents issued downwards all unimportant? Of course not. Among them, there are not only instructions and orders, but also policy provisions, methods, and so on.
    Some people may think that in order to get rid of bureaucracy, a leader should have the office director take care of these "administrative affairs." Even if this is somewhat reasonable, then the county heads who have "got rid of" bureaucracy should concentrate on studying the central work and handling major issues, right? In fact, this is not the case at all.
    Agricultural production and agricultural cooperation should be the most central work, but the county head is not very familiar with it either. In September of this year, the Provincial Supervisory Department and the Special District Supervisory Office came to Dongyang County one after another to inspect the implementation of the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and the implementation of the policy of socialist transformation of handicrafts. None of the three county heads could introduce relatively specific information.
    Furthermore, convening a meeting of the county People's Congress should be said to be the most important issue, but how many times has the county head studied this matter? Not even once. Taking the third meeting of the county People's Congress held in September of this year as an example, the work report made by the county People's Committee to the congress, which was the central topic of the meeting, should have been carefully studied by the county head personally. However, the county head asked me, a person with a low level of culture and theory, to draft it alone. In advance, they did not study the work achievements to be discussed in the report, the shortcomings that should be examined, and the future work tasks, and even did not give me an outline. May I ask, can a general cadre like me completely represent the county head and see through the basic situation and essence of the county's work? From this, one can imagine the quality of this report. After the meeting, the county head did not analyze the gains and existing problems of the meeting, and then asked me to write a summary report of the meeting to be submitted to the Provincial People's Committee. What I want to explain here is that I am not unwilling to do these tasks, but the question is, what is the county head supposed to do if I do these things?
    I do feel that although there are three county heads in Dongyang County who are "in command," they really do not "go into battle" very often.
    I hope that the relevant leading organs can pay close attention to this issue.

### 只“挂帅”不“出马”的县长

专栏：党员来信

    只“挂帅”不“出马”的县长编辑同志：
    我是一个县人民委员会的秘书，虽然是一个一般的工作人员，但接触一个县的领导活动比较多，因此也从中看出了一些问题。作为一个党员，我有责任向党报反映这些情况。
    浙江省东阳县原有三个县长，但是县人民委员会的工作却没有做好。原因是他们都是中共县委委员，三人都在县委分管一项专门工作，却没有一个县长主管人民委员会的工作。因此，县长虽有三个，但真正县长应当做的工作却没有人负责。应该说，像东阳县这样有五十多万人口的大县的人民委员会的工作任务是相当繁重的，没有名副其实的县长，不可能做好人民委员会的领导工作。但事实上，这种繁重的人民委员会的领导工作的担子却放在一个办公室副主任的肩上。
    县人民委员会的办公室里每月都收到大批从专署、省以至国务院发来的文件、公文和信件，但县长很少研究它，甚至连看也不看，就完全交给办公室主任“批”办。即使是最重要的文件，像国务院颁布的法令，省人民委员会关于春耕生产的决议、指示和最近发布的关于加强农业生产合作社的生产领导和组织建设的指示等也毫不例外。因此原来应该经过县长慎重研究以后才能办理的文件，也都由办公室主任批给“主管”科或者局去办理了。由县人民委员会往下发的文件更是如此，几乎全部是由办公室主任决定的。这些往下发的文件是否都是些不重要的呢？当然不是，其中不但有指示、命令，还有政策性的规定、办法等等。
    可能有人以为一个领导者为了摆脱事务主义，这些“行政事务”是应该由办公室主任负责的。即使这话说得有些道理，那末“摆脱”了事务主义的县长们应该集中精力研究中心工作和处理重大问题呀？事实上也完全不是这样。
    农业生产和农业合作化应该是最中心的工作吧，但是县长在这方面也并不怎样熟悉。今年9月份省监察厅、专区监察处先后到东阳县检查贯彻勤俭办社方针的执行情况和手工业社会主义改造政策的执行情况，三个县长没有一个能介绍出比较具体的情况。
    再说召开县人民代表大会会议应该说是最重要的问题了，但县长对此事进行过几次研究呢？一次也没有。就以今年9月份召开的县人民代表大会第三次会议来说，作为会议中心议题的县人民委员会向大会所作的工作报告，照理是应该经过县长亲自慎重研究的。但县长却叫我这样一个文化和理论水平都不高的人独自去起草，事先他们既没有研究报告中要谈的工作成绩、应该检讨的缺点和今后的工作任务，甚至连个提纲也没有给我。试问像我这样一个一般干部能够完全代表县长说话，看透全县工作的基本情况与实质吗？由此就可以想像到这个报告的质量了。会议结束后，县长也没有分析一下会议的收获、存在的问题，即又叫我写了一个向省人民委员会呈报的会议总结报告。这里要说明的是我不是不愿意做这些工作，问题在于这样做了到底要县长做什么呢？
    我的确感到东阳县“挂帅”的县长虽然有三个，但他们亲自“出马”做事的时间实在不多。
    希望有关领导机关能够切实注意一下这个问题。　王世能
