    Waste Management Bureau Issues Notice
    Attention to the Acquisition of Old Newspapers
    This newspaper reports that the National Cooperative Headquarters Waste Management Bureau has issued a notice to strengthen the business of acquiring old newspapers. According to statistics from relevant departments, more than 50,000 tons of old newspapers nationwide are scattered in the hands of readers across the country each year. Except for a portion that needs to be kept for reference, a large part of the rest is not well utilized. Some are sporadically used to wrap things, some are thrown away as waste paper, and some are accumulated without knowing how to deal with them. Only a very small number of readers know that they can sell them to waste recycling stations or supply and marketing cooperatives to offset some of the newspaper expenses. In order to plan and fully utilize old newspapers and reduce the burden on readers, the Waste Management Bureau has notified waste management offices in major cities across the country and supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels to strengthen and expand the business of acquiring old newspapers read by readers.

    废品管理总局发出通知
    注意收购旧报纸
    本报讯　全国合作总社废品管理总局通知加强收购旧报纸的业务。据有关方面统计，全国每年有五万吨以上的旧报纸分散在全国各地的读者手中，除一部分需要保存参考外，其余很大一部分没有很好地利用。有的零星地被用以包东西，有的被扔掉作废纸，有的积存下来不知如何处理。只有很少数的读者知道可以卖给废品收购站或供销合作社，以弥补一部分报费支出。为了有计划地充分利用旧报纸，并且减轻读者的负担，废品管理总局已经通知全国各大城市的废品经营处和各级供销合作社加强并扩大收购读者看过的旧报纸的业务。
