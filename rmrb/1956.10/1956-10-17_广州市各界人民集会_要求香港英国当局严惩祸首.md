Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th. One thousand three hundred representatives from all walks of life in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, held a meeting yesterday regarding the riots created by Kuomintang special agents in Kowloon. At the meeting, they unanimously demanded that the Hong Kong British authorities must swiftly and resolutely severely punish the Kuomintang special agents who planned and directed the riot, and must be responsible for handling the aftermath properly.

Lai Jiabi, a housewife representing Guangzhou women, said at the meeting that Kuomintang special agents and rioters arbitrarily killed our compatriots' parents, brothers, sisters, and relatives in Kowloon. Can the Hong Kong British authorities still adopt a tolerant and evasive attitude towards the Kuomintang special agents who created such a brutal incident? Luo Pinchao, a representative of cultural workers in Guangzhou and a Cantonese opera performer, believes that the Hong Kong British authorities must no longer allow Kuomintang special agents to go unpunished. She said that the Hong Kong British authorities must arrest and severely punish the culprits to appease public anger.

Chen Nengxing, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, believes that the Hong Kong British authorities distorted the riot as a factional struggle between left-wing and right-wing members, and said that the riot was planned and directed by secret societies. This attitude, which actually exonerates the Kuomintang special agents, is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.

In the speeches of representatives of workers, engineers, doctors, youth, women, students, returned overseas Chinese, and industrial and commercial circles, and religious circles, all expressed their firm support for Premier Zhou Enlai's serious protest against the Hong Kong British authorities' failure to stop the riots of Kuomintang special agents. Many representatives also believe that the Hong Kong British authorities must be responsible for compensating and treating the Kowloon compatriots who were killed and injured by the Kuomintang special agents and rioters, and be responsible for the aftermath of the destroyed factories, shops, and schools, and ensure the safety of the lives and property of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots, and must not allow similar incidents to happen again.

The conference finally passed a letter of condolences from the people of all walks of life in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, to the compatriots who were killed in the Kowloon riots and their families.

    广州市各界人民集会
    要求香港英国当局严惩祸首
    新华社广州16日电　广东省广州市各界人民代表一千三百人，昨天就国民党特务分子在九龙制造骚乱事件举行大会。他们在大会上一致要求香港英国当局必须迅速坚决地严厉惩办策划和指挥这次骚乱事件的国民党特务首恶分子，并且要负责办理好善后工作。
    代表广州市妇女的家庭妇女赖家碧在大会上说，国民党特务分子和暴徒在九龙任意残杀我国同胞的父母、兄弟、姐妹和亲朋。难道香港英国当局对制造这种惨绝人寰的事件的国民党特务分子还能采取纵容和推卸责任的态度吗？广州市文化工作者代表、粤剧演员罗品超认为香港英国当局决不能再让国民党特务逍遥法外。她说，香港英国当局必须把祸首缉拿严办，以平公愤。
    广东省工会联合会副主席陈能兴认为，香港英国当局把这次骚乱歪曲说成是什么左翼同右翼成员之间的派系斗争，并说这次骚乱事件是由秘密邦会策划和指挥。这种实际上为国民党特务首恶分子推脱罪行的态度，是中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。
    在工人、工程师、医生、青年、妇女、学生、归国华侨和工商界、宗教界等代表的发言中，对周恩来总理对香港英国当局未能制止国民党特务分子的骚乱所提出的严重抗议都表示坚决拥护。许多代表还认为，对于那些惨遭国民党特务、暴徒杀害和殴伤的九龙我国同胞，香港英国当局必须负责抚恤和医治，对捣毁的工厂、商店、学校负责善后，并保证港九同胞生命财产的安全，决不容许再有类似事件发生。
    大会最后通过了广东省广州市各界人民致在九龙骚乱事件中遇害的同胞及其家属的慰问信。
