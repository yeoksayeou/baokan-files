	Endless Blunders
    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles made another blunder at the press conference on October 16th. Because he had exceptionally revised the transcript of his speech after the last press conference, he was questioned by reporters this time. The reporters wanted him to guarantee that the record published by the U.S. State Department was the definitive record. This made Dulles very embarrassed. A Reuters reporter reported that Dulles was "often seemed to be on the verge of tears."
    The incident happened on October 2nd. At the press conference that day, after talking about the Suez Canal issue, Dulles said: The United States and Britain and France "now have some differences. The differences may be related to some fundamental issues." He believed that the United States "is neither 100% aligned with the so-called colonial countries, nor is it completely on the side of countries concerned with achieving independence as soon as possible." This is a two-faced statement. Dulles wanted to tell countries striving for independence that the United States was not a colonialist, and at the same time, he wanted to tell Britain and France that the United States was on the same side as them. Shortly after the press conference, the State Department announced that Dulles had made some revisions to the above statement, and explained: "Dulles did not intend to link the Suez situation with the overall issue of colonialism." However, Dulles's statement still aroused great resentment in Britain and France. Many British and French newspapers pointed out that in the eyes of many Asian and African countries, the United States is also a colonialist country. The British and French governments have also consistently expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. attitude.
    Dulles's practice of revising the transcript of his speech also aroused dissatisfaction in the American press, so they raised this issue at the beginning of this press conference. Dulles was very annoyed, "angry and agitated," and "his anger was obvious." He threatened to "change the nature of this press conference." He said, "Looking at it from the angle of finding gimmicks in the newspapers, seeing how Dulles blunders, how Dulles corrects his record, and how Dulles is inarticulate, they may play this role. If this is the purpose of the press conference, I don't think the purpose of the press conference is to do this kind of thing."
    Dulles's temper is unreasonable. Because the "gimmicks" were created by himself, and the blunder was made by himself. The American reporters just reported them. Dulles got so annoyed that he was almost brought to tears in order to cover up the blunders he had already made, which is called adding insult to injury. This is truly a Secretary of State who makes endless blunders. (Chao)

    出丑没个完
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在10月16日的记者招待会上又出了一次丑。因为他在上次招待会后破例地修改发言记录，这次受到了记者们的追问。记者们要他保证美国国务院发表的记录是算数的记录。这弄得杜勒斯十分狼狈。路透社的记者报道说：杜勒斯给逼得“时常似乎是快要掉泪的样子”。
    事情是在10月2日发生的。在那天的记者招待会上，杜勒斯在谈了苏伊士运河问题以后说：美国和英、法“现在是有些分歧的。分歧也许同某些带有根本性质的问题有关”。他认为美国“既不百分之百的与所谓殖民国家为伍，也不完全站在关心尽快取得独立的国家方面”。这是一种两面三刀的说法。杜勒斯既要对争取独立的国家表示美国不算是个殖民主义者，又要向英、法表示美国是同它们一鼻孔出气的。招待会后不久，国务院就宣布杜勒斯对上述发言已经作了一些修改，而且解释说：“杜勒斯无意把苏伊士局势同全面的殖民主义问题联系在一起。”然而，杜勒斯的发言仍然引起了英法两国很大的反感。不少英法报纸指出：在许多亚非国家看来，美国也是个殖民主义国家。英法政府也一直对美国的态度表示不满。
    杜勒斯修改发言记录的做法，也引起了美国报界的不满，因此他们在这次记者招待会上一开始就提出了这个问题。杜勒斯非常恼火，“气忿而又激动”，“怒形于色”。他威胁说要“改变这种记者招待会的性质”。他说，“从在报纸上找噱头，看：杜勒斯怎样怎样地出丑；杜勒斯怎样怎样地更正他的记录和杜勒斯怎样怎样地辞不达意，从这样的角度来看，它们可能起这种作用如果这就是记者招待会的目的，我并不认为，记者招待会的目的就是干这种事。”
    杜勒斯这个脾气是发得没有道理的。因为，“噱头”是他自己制造出来的，丑是他自己出的，美国记者不过报道了它们就是了。杜勒斯为了掩饰自己已经出了的丑而恼火到快掉眼泪，这就叫做丑上加丑。这真是一位出丑没个完的国务卿。　　（超）
