Xinhua News Agency, October 5th: Hamburg News – West German Chancellor Adenauer has recently repeatedly advocated for the establishment of a "European Federation." Adenauer emphasized the issue of establishing a "European Federation" during his meetings with Belgian government representatives and French Prime Minister Mollet in late September. On October 1st, he elaborated on his proposal at a press conference held in Hamburg. At the Hamburg press conference, Adenauer said that only by uniting Europe economically, politically, and militarily can it "maintain Europe's position in the world." He said that this was necessary because there are now many "powerful countries" in the world, and "no European country can withstand the enormous pressure of these powerful countries." In this regard, he pointed to the great power of the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the rise of China and India. He also pointed out that the establishment of a new European Union would by no means be directed against the United States.

Adenauer emphasized that Britain must be a member of any "complete European entity." He believes that the best way to establish a European Federation is to strengthen the activities of the existing "Western European Union," in which Britain participates.

It can be seen from West German newspaper reports that Adenauer is trying to give the "Western European Union" the nature of a political alliance of Western European countries to supplement the existing Western European military and economic blocs. In this regard, the West German ruling group hopes that West Germany can play a leading role in the new "European Union."

The West German Social Democratic Party magazine "Der Spiegel" wrote in its commentary on Adenauer's "European Federation" plan: The difference between this plan and Adenauer's previous plans on European issues is that Europe should become a "third force." The magazine believes that this is an intention to no longer "seek" only "to benefit under the protection of the United States." The commentary also believes that Adenauer's proposal to establish a "European Federation" is another pursuit of the illusion of Europeanism.

Xinhua News Agency, October 5th: According to TASS, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles expressed his welcome to Adenauer's proposal to transform the "Western European Union" into a so-called "European Federation" at a press conference on October 2nd. Dulles believes this is "very good."

Dulles believes that Western Europe can become a "third force between the Soviet Union and the United States." However, he expressed opposition to making this "third force" a "neutral force."

At the same time, the British Foreign Office has adopted a "cautious" attitude towards West German Chancellor Adenauer's proposal. Britain is the country that Adenauer is trying to pull into the "European Federation."

### 阿登纳鼓吹建立“欧洲联邦”  美国反对欧洲出现中立势力，英国采取“审慎”态度

    阿登纳鼓吹建立“欧洲联邦”
    美国反对欧洲出现中立势力，英国采取“审慎”态度
    新华社5日讯　汉堡消息：西德总理阿登纳最近一再鼓吹建立“欧洲联邦”。阿登纳在9月下旬同比利时政府代表以及同法国总理摩勒会谈的时候都曾强调提出建立“欧洲联邦”的问题。10月1日，他在汉堡举行的记者招待会上又着重阐述了他的主张。阿登纳在汉堡的记者招待会上说，现在只有把欧洲在经济上、政治上和军事上统一起来，才能“保持住欧洲在世界上的地位”。他说，所以有必要这样作，是因为现在世界上存在着许多“强大的国家”，而“没有一个欧洲国家经受得起这些强大的国家的巨大压力”。在这方面，他指出了美国和苏联的巨大力量以及中国和印度的兴起。他同时指出，成立新的欧洲联盟将决不是针对着美国的。
    阿登纳强调，英国必须是任何“完整的欧洲本体”的成员。他认为建立欧洲联邦最好是通过加强目前有英国参加的“西欧联盟”的活动。
    从西德报刊报道中可以看出，阿登纳力图使“西欧联盟”带有西欧国家的政治联盟的性质，以补充现有的西欧的军事集团和经济集团。在这方面，西德统治集团指望西德能在新的“欧洲联盟”中起领导作用。
    西德社会民主党杂志“明镜”周刊在评论阿登纳的“欧洲联邦”计划时写道：这个计划同阿登纳以前提出的关于欧洲问题的许多计划比较起来，不同之处就在于，欧洲应当成为“第三种势力”。这家杂志认为，这是一种不再“寻求”只是“在美国庇护下获得好处”的意图。评论同时认为，阿登纳关于建立“欧洲联邦”的主张是又一次对欧洲主义者的幻想的追求。
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社报道：美国国务卿杜勒斯在10月2日的记者招待会上表示欢迎阿登纳想把“西欧联盟”变为所谓“欧洲联邦”的主张。杜勒斯认为，这是“非常好的”。
    杜勒斯认为，西欧可以成为“苏联和美国之间的第三种势力”。但是，他表示反对使这种“第三种势力”成为“中立的势力”。
    同时，英国外交部却对西德总理阿登纳的主张采取“审慎”的态度。英国是阿登纳竭力要拉它加入“欧洲联邦”的国家。
