	Surplus Grain Cooperative Turns Into Grain-Deficient Cooperative

	In August, beyond Yanmen Pass, it is the busy season of the autumn harvest, and people are celebrating the year's bumper harvest. However, some members of the Shalinghe Township in Shuoxian County, Shanxi Province, are frowning because of the reduced production of corn. This township is close to the Southern Mountains, with barren soil and a cold climate, and has never grown Golden Queen corn before. However, the county's Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, disregarding these actual conditions, insisted on assigning the task of planting Golden Queen corn downwards, asking the township to sow six thousand mu. The agricultural cooperatives here did not dare to accept this task. The township staff had repeatedly requested instructions from the county's Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, explaining that it was not suitable to grow this late-maturing crop here. The county's Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry not only did not accept their suggestions but also said they were "too conservative" and said: "If you are told to plant, it is guaranteed to mature."

	Although the township selected the best land and planted more than five thousand mu of Golden Queen, the growth was still very poor. The White Dew has passed, and most of these corns have not yet formed cobs. According to the actual investigation of the county and township cadres in the Upper and Lower Shalinghe agricultural cooperatives, 20% of the Golden Queen corn in the whole township can mature, 30% can only be boiled for consumption, and 50% are bare stalks. Of the 600 mu of Golden Queen in the Lower Shalinghe agricultural cooperative, 500 mu have no harvest at all. For the remaining 100 mu, if the frost is late, each mu may harvest dozens of jin. The cooperative members reported that this year's corn cannot even recover the cost of labor and fertilizer.

	The reduction in corn production has greatly affected the enthusiasm of the masses for production. Now, most cooperative members in this township have the idea of ​​"whether they work or not, they still eat supplies." After the potatoes of the Upper Shalinghe agricultural cooperative were dug up, they were dried in the yard, and no one cared about them. The millet was blown down by the wind and spoiled by sparrows, and no one cared about it. Many cooperative members complained: Forcing us to grow late-maturing corn has caused us to harvest less grain.

	All eleven agricultural cooperatives in the township were originally surplus grain cooperatives, but from the recent formulation of the profit distribution plan, seven agricultural cooperatives not only cannot sell surplus grain but also need the state to supply more than 100,000 jin of grain.

### 余粮社变成缺粮社

    余粮社变成缺粮社
    雁门关外的8月，正是秋收农忙季节，人们都喜庆一年的丰收。可是山西省朔县沙塄河乡的一些社员却因为种植玉米减产而愁眉不展。这个乡靠近南山，土质瘠薄，气候寒冷，从来没有种过金皇后玉米，可是这个县的农林局却不根据这些实际条件，硬向下分配种植金皇后玉米的任务，叫这个乡播种六千亩。这里的农业社，都不敢接受这个任务。这个乡的工作人员曾多次请示县农林局，说明这里不宜种植这种晚熟作物。县农林局不但不接受他们的建议，反说他们“太保守”并且说：“叫种，保险能熟”。
    这个乡虽然选了最好的土地，种了五千多亩金皇后，但是生长的仍然很坏。白露已经过了，这些玉米大部分还没有结下棒子。据县、乡干部在上、下沙塄河两个农业社的实际调查，全乡的金皇后玉米，有20％能成熟，30％只能煮着吃，50％是光秆子。下沙塄河农业社的六百亩金皇后，有五百亩没有一点收获，其余的一百亩，如果下霜晚一点，每亩可能收几十斤，社员们反映，今年的这些玉米连工、粪钱都拿不回来。
    玉米减产大大影响了群众生产积极性，现在这个乡里的多数社员都有“劳动不劳动，还是吃供应”的思想。上沙塄河农业社的马铃薯刨回后，在院里晒着，没人过问，谷子被风刮倒被山雀糟蹋也没人管。许多社员埋怨说：硬叫我们种晚熟玉米，害得我们少打了粮食。
    全乡的十一个农业社原来都是余粮社，可是从最近制定收益分配方案来看，有七个农业社不但不能卖余粮，还需要由国家供应十万多斤粮食。　刘彦芳
