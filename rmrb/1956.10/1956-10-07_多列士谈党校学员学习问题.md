Xinhua News Agency, Paris, October 5th (TASS): Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, delivered a report to the teachers of the Advanced Party School on teaching Marxism-Leninism in the French Communist Party School. Thorez asked the teachers to pay attention to their current tasks. He said that the students of the Party School should acquire broad and profound knowledge of the different paths of various countries transitioning to socialism, and should learn to understand the conditions for striving for the unity of action of the working class and correctly estimate the current French political situation.

Thorez then pointed out that when studying history, attention must be mainly focused on the modern stage starting from 1917-1920, while also not neglecting the most significant historical events of previous stages. Thorez finally pointed out that teachers should pay special attention to the doctrine of the new type of party and should explain the ideological and organizational principles of building the new type of party.
