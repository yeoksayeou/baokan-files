Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: The Second Korean Writers' Congress was held in Pyongyang from October 14th to 16th.

Han Sorya, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Writers' Union, delivered a report at the congress entitled "The Present Situation and Prospects of Post-War Korean Literature." In his report, he said that at this congress we should freely exchange opinions, openly conduct discussions, analyze our achievements, and criticize shortcomings and errors, so that our literature can take a big step forward. In his report, Han Sorya also put forward some suggestions on improving the organizational issues of the Writers' Union.

After discussion, the congress adopted a resolution and a new charter for the Writers' Union, and elected the new central body of the Writers' Union.

The resolution pointed out that it is necessary to inherit and promote Korea's literary heritage and revolutionary literary traditions, and improve the creative level of writers. The resolution emphasized the need to overcome the main shortcomings in current literary creation—formalism and documentationism—so that literary creation can enter a new upsurge.

The congress decided to add two sub-committees for the study of classical literature and South Korean literature, and a guidance department for young writers to the Writers' Union.

In order to peacefully reunify the fatherland, the congress called for uniting South Korean writers and realizing cultural exchange between North and South Korea.

Foreign writers and representatives from all walks of life in North Korea who were invited to attend the congress delivered congratulatory messages to the congress. Chinese writer Li Rui delivered a congratulatory message to the congress and presented the gift of the Chinese Writers' Association to Han Sorya, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Writers' Union.
