Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 27th. The Hong Kong "Wen Wei Po" published an article by Jin Shishi on the fourth page on the 26th, titled "Such 'Sincere Confession'". The article said that now even some of the more courageous Kuomintang (KMT) secret agents in Hong Kong are "frankly" admitting that the Kowloon riots were their own doing.

Jin Shishi's article said that on the 13th, Hong Kong's "True News" published an article advising the rioters to "endure death for a moment, and wait for dawn," and "advising the masses not to let emotions run wild, but to plant the national flag (the KMT flag) on the mainland!" The "True News" article believed that these rioters "were too impulsive, and only relied on their courage and recklessness, which will cause unfavorable consequences. Randomly setting fires and beating people are unacceptable, and the actions of mobs that hinder the 'rule of law' are really not what is needed at this time and place."

Then, the "True News" article "sincerely confessed" to the KMT secret agents: "The matter has developed to the point of being beyond redemption today; therefore, no matter how indignant and impulsive you are, you must abide by the law. Because under today's circumstances, we still have to 'endure death for a moment, and wait for dawn.' Under the eaves of Hong Kong, we can only persevere and wait for a change in circumstances. It is not advisable to engage in actions that go beyond the scope of the law. 'As long as the green hills remain, there is no fear of running out of firewood.' If you have the strength, the future is long, and great things can be accomplished. There are too many places to vent your emotions and develop your ambitions! When the day of the counterattack really comes, we will still have time to throw our heads and shed our blood, as long as the revolutionary enthusiasm still exists, we will definitely plant the blue sky, white sun, and red earth national flag back on the mainland without any doubt." Jin Shishi's article said that it is truly "without any doubt" that the great riots in Kowloon and the great tragedy in Tsuen Wan were originally the work of personnel from Taiwan in a "counterattack," but the "counterattack" was not at the right time or place.

The article concludes: But this article is frank, "A true hero takes responsibility for his actions." Compared to the rumors of "Communist instigation" and "left-right struggle," this is far too weak.

### 香港“真报”承认骚乱是国民党特务干的

    香港“真报”承认骚乱是国民党特务干的
    据新华社广州27日电　26日香港“文汇报”四版发表了今史氏的一篇文章，题目是“如此‘掬诚相告’”。文章说，现在香港有点勇气的国民党特务分子也“坦白”承认九龙暴乱是他们自己干的了。
    今史氏的文章说，13日香港“真报”载文劝暴徒“忍死须臾，以待天明”，“劝群众勿让感情横决，要把国旗（国民党旗）插上大陆去！”“真报”这篇文章认为，这些暴徒“是太冲动了些，且仅逞血气之勇，将造成不利的后果。那样的乱放火乱打人都要不得的，妨碍‘法治’的暴民行动实不是此时此地所应有”。
    接着“真报”的文章向国民党特务“掬诚相告”说：“事情发展到今天，已到不可收拾的地步；因之，无论如何愤激和冲动，非遵守法令不可的。因为在今日之下，我们还得‘忍死须臾，以待天明’，在香港的屋檐下只有苦撑待变之份，不宜牵入超越法律范围的行动，‘留待青山在，不怕没柴烧’，有力量的话，来日方长，大事可为，值得宣泄情感发展抱负的地方太多太多了！真的到了反攻的那一天，我们掷头颅洒鲜血还来得及，只要革命的热情还存在的话，一定会把青天白日满地红国旗插回大陆去毫无疑义。”今史氏的文章说，真是“毫无疑义”，九龙的大暴乱，荃湾的大惨剧，原来是台湾方面的人马在“反攻”，但“反攻”不得其时其地耳。
    文章最后说：但这篇文章，不失是坦白的，“好汉作事一身当”，什么“共党策动”，什么“左右之争”的谰言，相形之下，这未免太乏了。
