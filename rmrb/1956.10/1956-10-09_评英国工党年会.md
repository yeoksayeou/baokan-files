Observer Commentary

　　The 55th annual conference of the British Labour Party, which began on October 1st, closed on the 5th. This Labour Party conference was convened at a time when British domestic and foreign policies were facing serious difficulties and contradictions. The reactionary domestic and foreign policies pursued by the British government have aroused increasingly strong dissatisfaction among the British people, who are eagerly demanding a change in current policies to improve the current situation. Under these circumstances, this Labour Party conference has taken a step forward, and it has passed some resolutions on major issues such as the peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue, maintaining peace and promoting international cooperation, and improving financial economy and people's living conditions, which are conducive to solving these problems. This is a noteworthy new sign in British political life. However, due to the control of the right-wing leadership group, these resolutions are far from reflecting the demands of the vast majority of ordinary Labour Party members.
    It is no accident that the Labour Party conference showed particular concern about the Suez Canal issue. The British government's irrational and unrealistic policy toward Egypt's regaining sovereignty over the Suez Canal Company has led to tensions in the Middle East and seriously damaged Britain's interests and prestige. The resolution passed by the annual conference, while not recognizing Egypt's right to reclaim the canal, condemned the British government's policy and advocated seeking a peaceful solution through negotiations. Facts have proved that only peaceful negotiations based on respect for Egyptian sovereignty are the only way to solve the Suez Canal issue. If the British government now still violates the will of the British people, attempting to rely on the "support" of the United States, and uses military threats and other rude means to seize the Suez Canal from the Egyptian people, this will not only fail to achieve any good results, but also risks pulling America's "chestnuts out of the fire."
    The time has come for Britain to change its course on its entire foreign policy. Since the beginning of this year, the British government has made a more realistic assessment of the international situation, and has expressed its willingness to promote understanding and cooperation between the East and the West, so that Britain can get rid of the heavy burden of arms expansion and war preparation, in order to overcome serious financial and economic difficulties. However, there is still a big gap between these words and actual actions, and the British people are certainly not satisfied. This can also be clearly seen from the Labour Party conference. In its resolution, the Labour Party conference advocated that the government should cooperate with the United States, France and the Soviet Union to solve the problem of European security, strive to ban all weapons of mass destruction, and demand a substantial reduction in military spending and the reduction of armed forces. At the same time, the Labour Party conference expressed dissatisfaction with the government's failure to "take adequate measures" to deal with "the consequences of the paralyzed economy caused by the huge armaments plan," and implemented "economic measures" to tighten the people's belts, believing that this policy "is leading the country to the brink of economic crisis." These resolutions are in line with the actual situation and reflect the demands of the vast majority of Labour Party members. If the British government adopts these propositions, it will be conducive to improving Britain's difficult situation.
    This British Labour Party conference shows the growth of the British workers' movement. Despite the right-wing leadership group of the Labour Party trying its best to strengthen control and vetoing the proposals put forward by grassroots organizations on major issues such as peaceful coexistence, ending colonial rule, and establishing international solidarity between the Labour Party and the Communist Party. However, the facts have proved that it is impossible for them to curb the development of the workers' movement. As long as the British working class and all the people strengthen unity and act in unison, they will certainly be able to make a great contribution to the cause of peace and democracy.

### 评英国工党年会

　　评英国工党年会
    自10月1日起举行的英国工党第五十五届年会，已经在五日闭幕。这次工党年会是在英国内政外交政策正处在严重困难和矛盾的情况下召开的。英国政府所奉行的反动的内外政策，引起了英国人民愈来愈强烈的不满，他们迫切要求改变现行政策，以改善当前的局势。就在这种情况下，这届工党年会已向前迈进了一步，它在和平解决苏伊士运河问题、维护和平和促进国际合作，以及改善财政经济和人民生活状况等重大问题上，通过了一些有利于解决这些问题的决议。这是英国政治生活中值得注意的一个新迹象。虽然由于右翼领导集团的控制，这些决议还远不足以反映广大工党普通党员的要求。
    工党年会对苏伊士运河问题表现了特别的关切，这不是偶然的。英国政府对埃及收回苏伊士运河公司的主权行动，采取既不理智又不现实的政策，导致了中东地区的紧张局势，并使英国的利益和声望遭到了严重的打击。年会通过的决议，虽然没有承认埃及收回运河的权利，但它谴责了英国政府的政策，主张用谈判的方式谋取和平解决。事实已经证明，只有在尊重埃及主权的基础上进行和平谈判，才是解决苏伊士运河问题的唯一途径。如果英国政府现在仍然违反英国人民的意志，企图依靠美国的“支持”，用军事威胁和其他粗暴的手段，从埃及人民的手里夺取苏伊士运河，这不仅不可能取得任何好的结果，而且有替美国“从火中取栗”的危险。
    英国在整个外交政策上都已到了应该改弦更辙的时候。今年以来，英国政府曾对国际局势作了比较现实的估计，并表示愿意促进东西方的谅解和合作，使英国能够摆脱扩军备战的沉重负担，以便克服财政经济的严重困难。但是，这些言论和实际行动之间还有很大的距离，英国人民当然是不能满意的。从工党年会中也可以清楚地看到这一点。工党年会在决议中主张政府应同美国、法国和苏联合作，解决欧洲安全问题，争取禁止一切大规模毁灭性武器，并要求大量削减军备开支和裁减武装部队。同时，工党年会对政府未能对“庞大军备计划而引起的使经济陷于瘫痪的后果”“采取充分的措施”，而实行束紧人民腰带的“经济措施”，表示不满，认为这个政策“把国家引向了经济危机的边缘。”这些决议是符合实际情况的，是反映了工党广大群众的要求的，英国政府如果采纳这些主张，就将有利于改善英国的困难处境。
    这届英国工党年会显示了英国工人运动的增长。尽管工党的右翼领导集团千方百计地想加强控制，并且否决了基层组织所提出的关于和平共处、结束殖民统治和建立工党和共产党的国际团结等重大问题的提案。但是，事实已经证明，它们要遏阻工人运动的发展，是不可能的。只要英国工人阶级和全体人民加强团结和行动一致，就一定能够对和平民主的事业作出巨大的贡献。
