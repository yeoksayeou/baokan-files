　　Basketball Selection Tournament Day 3
    Tianjin and the All-Star Team Defeat Macau and the Public Security Forces Respectively
    Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The fast-moving Tianjin men's basketball team defeated the Macau men's basketball team with an absolute advantage of 142 to 57 tonight, setting the highest scoring record in the Chinese Olympic Games basketball selection tournament in three days.
    Before today, the highest score was held by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Public Security Forces men's basketball team, who defeated the Macau men's basketball team 120 to 63 on the 8th. Today, the Public Security Forces team played against the All-Star team composed of the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" men's basketball team and the Beijing Sports Institute men's basketball team. The All-Star team won 97 to 82.
    The agile Macau team performed well in the first few minutes of the game, and their scores were not much different from the Tianjin team. However, the taller and more physically fit Tianjin team launched more and more fast breaks, making it impossible for the Macau team members to resist. Even so, the Macau team members still tried their best to counterattack. Their main player, Liang Bin (No. 10), repeatedly won warm applause from the audience for his accurate one-handed shooting technique. Liang Bin scored 26 points today, almost half of the Macau team's score.
    Today, the All-Star men's basketball team adopted a man-to-man defense tactic, which made it difficult for the Public Security Forces to exert their fast-break skills, and took the lead with 43 to 33 in the first half. In the second half, the Public Security Forces tried hard to counterattack and once narrowed the gap to 58 to 51. However, because several main players, Cai Jijie (No. 4), Wei Wenyuan (No. 15), and Zhang Dexin (No. 6), were sent off one after another, the All-Star team led by 89 to 69 by twenty points in the last three minutes. However, the tenacious Public Security Forces launched a very fierce attack in the last three minutes, scoring a total of 13 points in these three minutes, while the All-Star team only scored 8 points.

　　篮球选拔赛第三天
    天津和联队分别胜澳门和公安军
    新华社9日讯　动作快速的天津男子篮球队今晚以一百四十二比五十七的绝对优势战胜了澳门男子篮球队，创造了三天来中国奥林匹克运动队篮球选拔赛得分的最高纪录。
    在今天以前得分最高的是中国人民解放军公安军男子篮球队，他们8日以一百二十比六十三胜澳门男子篮球队。公安军队今天同由中国人民解放军“八一”男子篮球队和北京体育学院男子篮球队组成的联队举行了比赛，联队以九十七比八十二获胜。
    动作灵活的澳门队在比赛开始的最初几分钟曾经有良好的表演，得分同天津队相差不多，但是个子高大、体力充沛的天津队越来越多的快攻，使澳门队队员无法招架。即使如此，澳门队队员仍然努力反攻，他们的主力队员梁彬（10号）准确的单手投篮技术一再博得了观众的热烈掌声。梁彬今天一个人就得了二十六分，几乎等于澳门队得分的一半。
    联队男子篮球队今天采取人钉人的防守战术，使公安军的快攻技术很难发挥，在上半场以四十三比三十三占先。下半场公安军队努力反攻，曾经追到五十八比五十一的局面，但是因为几个主力队员蔡集杰（4号）、魏文演（15号）和张德鑫（6号）先后被罚下，联队到最后三分钟的时候又以八十九比六十九领先二十分。但是，作风顽强的公安军队在最后三分钟进攻非常猛，在这三分钟内他们共得了十三分，而联队只得了八分。
