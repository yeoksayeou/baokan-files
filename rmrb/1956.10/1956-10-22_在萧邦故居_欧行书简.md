At Chopin's Former Residence – Letters from a European Journey
    Jun Qing

Chopin's former residence is located in a place called Żelazowa Wola, about one hundred kilometers from Warsaw, a beautiful rural area. The slender and elegant Utrata River flows slowly through here, and towering poplars and lush linden trees form an oval green wall. This old residence is located deep within this green wall. As our car approached Wola, I saw many vehicles and people, almost blocking the road. The Polish writer Andrzej Braun, who accompanied me, told me that these people were here to visit Chopin's former residence. It was a Sunday, and according to past custom, there was a piano concert every Sunday at Chopin's former residence. There were especially many people who came here on this day. The performer played Chopin's music in Chopin's house, and the audience listened on the lawn outside the house. After the performance, everyone wandered around and visited the garden. This custom has been going on for many years, and no one knows when it started.

Our car stopped at the gate of Chopin's former residence. The gate was very ordinary but very unique. Unlike the residences of ordinary Polish nobles, which have tall houses right inside the gate, it was like a quiet farmhouse. The house was deeply hidden in a large garden. Upon entering the gate, you couldn't see the house's shadow. There was only a long, quiet tree-lined road, with endless trees and flowers on both sides. We walked for a long time before we saw the old residence surrounded by flowers and trees. It was a low, farmhouse-like house, simple and elegant. A huge chestnut tree stood in front of the door, and the gray-white iron roof shone in the sun. The house was surrounded by blooming flowers and trees.

The person in charge of the house told us that this residence originally belonged to the estate of Count Skarbek. Chopin's father, Nicolas Chopin, was a Frenchman of Polish descent. When Poland was subjected to the Second Partition, he joined the Polish national hero Kościuszko's uprising force to avenge the country, fighting in various parts of Poland. After the failure of the uprising, he drifted to Wola and became a tutor for Count Skarbek's children. Here, he fell in love with Justyna Krzyżanowska, a distant relative of the Count. They married on June 2, 1806, and on March 1, 1810, Fryderyk Chopin was born in this house. At that time, Poland was in a historically stormy era. The country, which had been partitioned for the third time, was filled with panic and unease. The troops of the Napoleonic dynasty constantly passed through and stationed in Wola, disrupting the tranquility of the countryside. Therefore, eight months after Chopin was born, Nicolas Chopin moved his family to Warsaw. The great musician spent his childhood in Warsaw, but the former residence in Wola was something Chopin was exceptionally fond of and missed. He often returned here, spending entire days playing in this wooded garden. There was a small river in this garden, the slender and quiet Utrata River. Trees and reeds grew densely on both banks, and their velvety shadows were clearly reflected on the emerald-like river surface. Chopin loved this river very much. He often sat under the trees by the river, gazing intently at the quiet river and its poetic reflections. He sometimes visited the homes of farmers near his residence, where he heard many folk tunes played by the farmers. These rough and beautiful melodies often intoxicated him for a long time and were deeply engraved in his memory.

The fact that this residence was discovered to be Chopin's birthplace was only known in 1891. At that time, a Russian composer who loved Chopin, Balakirev, found Chopin's birth certificate in a church eleven kilometers from Wola. Following the address on it, he found this place. Since then, some of Chopin's household items have been preserved. Now, all the furnishings in this residence are arranged as they were when Chopin was born. As soon as you enter the door, you see Chopin's father's study, where many French books are placed in old-fashioned bookshelves. In Chopin's mother's room, a Polish tapestry with crimson patterns hangs on the wall. A seventeenth-century wardrobe stands in the corner of the wall, and an old grandfather clock stands in the other corner. A piano is placed by the window, which is the piano used by Chopin's mother. It is said that Chopin's mother was a very gentle woman. She had a genius-like endowment, was proficient in French, and was a good pianist. In her youth, she was a very lively girl, often singing and dancing with the women in the village. But she was very poor and had no property of her own, so she and her grandmother lived with Count Skarbek.

Next to Chopin's mother's room, close to the garden, is Chopin's grandmother's room. A grand piano is also placed by the window, which is used for Sunday concerts. The Sunday concerts are held in this room because the room has windows on three sides, and outside the windows are flowers and lawns. The performer closes the door and plays alone in the room, and people listen outside the windows. Soon after I arrived here, the performance of Chopin's music began. The performer that day was the pianist Radfanova from Warsaw. She was a graceful and generous young woman who slowly walked into the room, smiled at the window, and sat down in front of the piano, rubbing her fingers. Then, a harmonious piano sound rang from the room, and immediately, the air was filled with melodious sounds. This unique sustained note trembled and lingered in the air for a long time, like a bee flying in the flowers. The drawn-out, light, slightly vibrating sound led people into a charming, poetic realm. Then, a polonaise with a strong Polish national style began. This was Chopin's work from his youth. With the beautiful melody of this piece, the magnificent scenery of Poland's mountains and rivers unfolded before us: I seemed to see the spring breeze gently blowing across the vast Polish fields, the spring tide on the green Vistula River gently lapping against the soft sandy beaches, the snow on the blue, towering Tatra Mountains sparkling like mirrors in the bright sunlight, and a flock of sheep like white clouds rolling over the brown village paths covered in green shade. ... Ah, I was completely intoxicated, intoxicated by this wonderful music. My imagination soared with the piano sound to very far away places.

As the piece ended, the entire garden rejoiced.

When the second piece began, the joyful melody turned into a melancholic bass. This was a farewell song when Chopin left his homeland. On November 2, 1830, the young Chopin left his country with a depressed mood. At the time of farewell, friends gave him a silver cup filled with Polish soil, instructing him to carry this cup with him no matter where he wandered, and to commemorate his homeland's soil at all times. The sad farewell song disappeared into the lingering bass. After a short interval, the old house rang with stormy sounds, which was the famous, imposing revolutionary etude. This piece was created in 1831 when Chopin heard the news of the fall of Warsaw in the city of Stuttgart on his way from Vienna to Paris, in extreme grief and anger. People told me that shortly after Chopin left his homeland, the Warsaw Uprising broke out, and the heart of the enslaved country regained its freedom. The whole of Poland was agitated. Filled with longing for his homeland and hatred for the aggressors, Chopin also used his piano to participate in the battle for his country abroad. During this period, he expressed his deep remembrance and loyalty to his homeland in many of his creations. However, the Polish revolution did not last long. Under the attack of the Tsar's troops, Warsaw fell on November 7, 1831. At that time, Chopin was leaving Vienna for Paris. When he arrived in Stuttgart, the unfortunate news reached his ears, and he was almost shocked into a stupor.

It was also on this day that Chopin wrote the famous Revolutionary Etude, expressing his intense emotions in this piece. The first few strong, discordant chords of the piece played out Poland's struggle for freedom in its struggles and roars; the torrential, tumbling downward piano notes were like the unshackled iron chains, heavily falling from the slaves. Then, the continuous rapid playing unfolded before us a thrilling picture of Polish warriors chasing the enemy with ten thousand horses galloping. The earth shook, and Poland, covered in wounds, stood up, struggling, fighting, and standing up. But it fell again under the swords of the invaders, and the piano sound turned to grief and sorrow. This desolate piano sound cast a shadow on the faces of the audience, and their mood became heavy. But the sad melody quickly disappeared, and the piece jumped to a high, loud note, which seemed like a loud bugle filled with optimism and enthusiasm, blowing a stirring battle call, and people's emotions immediately became excited and active again. ...

The piece ended in a stormy, high-pitched rapid playing. My heart was deeply attracted by the piano sound. I stood under the lilac tree outside the window for a long time, listening to the lingering sound, and for a moment I dreamed and forgot where I was.

The concert ended, and the people gathered outside the window began to move around. Some went to play in various parts of the garden, and some talked about today's performance and Chopin's life in groups of three and five. On the lawn next to the small river, a group of music school students were listening attentively to their female teacher tell them about Chopin's later years. The female teacher emotionally told the children that after Chopin heard the news of the fall of Warsaw in Stuttgart, this artist, filled with the pain of national subjugation, tightly held the silver cup filled with Polish soil in his arms and drifted to Paris, the city of flowers. Here, he spent the last eighteen years of his life. Although he was getting farther and farther away from his homeland, his music and emotions were getting closer and closer to his homeland. During this period, he wrote many passionate, heroic, and immortal patriotic pieces. But the cruel and merciless disease took away his health. After a long period of lingering illness, on October 17, 1849, this genius musician who wandered abroad ended his life of poverty and illness and left the world forever. Until his death, the silver cup filled with the soil of his homeland was still tightly placed by Chopin's side. After Chopin died, people followed his instructions: they scattered the Polish soil in this silver cup into his grave. ...

I could see what kind of emotions the female teacher's narration aroused in the hearts of the children. Several children stared blankly at the windows of the old house, their eyes sparkling with tears. Ah, my heart also began to beat. Regarding Chopin's music and his life, I have heard it more than once in our country, but the impression it gave me has never been as profound as it is today, nor has it ever moved me as much as it does today. With admiration and nostalgia, we left this elegant, quiet, and beautiful old house. On the way back, for a long time, the stormy and soul-shaking piano sound was still ringing in my ears, and the face of this patriotic genius and pioneer of modern music was constantly appearing in my mind. ...

    在萧邦故居——欧行书简
    峻青
    萧邦的故居，是在离华沙大约一百公里的一个叫热里亚左瓦·沃里亚的地方，这是一个风景幽美的农村。纤细的文雅的渥特拉河慢悠悠地从这儿流过，高耸的白杨和茂密的菩提树在这儿构成了一个椭圆形的绿色围墙。这一所古老的住宅，就座落在这绿色围墙的深处。当我们的汽车快驶近沃里亚的时候，我看到了许许多多车辆和人群，他们几乎把道路都堵塞住了。陪我一起来的波兰作家安捷依·布劳恩告诉我说：这些人都是来参观萧邦故居的。这是一个星期天，按照过去的习惯，在萧邦故居里，每个星期天都有钢琴演奏会。这一天，到这儿来的人特别多。演奏者在萧邦的屋子里弹奏萧邦的乐曲，听众们都在屋外的草地上倾听，演奏完了，大家就在这里游园和参观。这个习惯已经好多年了，谁也不知道是什么时候形成的。
    我们的车子在萧邦故居的大门口停下了，这门是很普通的，但却很别致，它不像一般的波兰贵族的府邸，一进大门就是高高的住宅，而是像一个幽静的农舍。房屋深深地藏在很大的花园里面，一进大门，看不见住宅的影子，只有一条长长的幽静的林荫路，路的两旁，是一眼望不到边的苍苍茫茫的树木和花草。我们走了好长的一段路，才看到了那一所被花木重重包围着的古老的住宅。这是一幢低低的农舍般的屋子，朴素而又文雅，一棵巨大的栗子树耸立在门前，灰白色的铁屋顶在太阳下面放着光，屋子的周围全是一片盛开着的花木。
    管理屋子的人告诉我们：这所住宅本来是一个叫施卡尔别克的伯爵底领地。萧邦的父亲——尼古拉·萧邦，是一位有着波兰血统的法国人，当波兰遭受第二次瓜分的时候，他参加了波兰民族英雄柯斯丘什科的复国雪耻的起义部队，转战波兰各地。起义失败后，飘流到沃里亚，给施卡尔别克伯爵的孩子当家庭教师，在这里，他和伯爵的远房亲戚尤斯汀娜·克瑞扎诺夫卡娅发生了爱情，他们在1806年6月2日结了婚，到1810年3月1日，弗列得利克·萧邦就在这所屋子里降生了。那时候，波兰正处于历史上暴风雨般的动荡时代，第三次被瓜分了的祖国，到处都充满了惊惶和不安，拿破仑王朝的军队，不断地在沃里亚的地方路过和停驻，使宁静的乡村失去了宁静。于是，在萧邦生下后的八个月，尼古拉·萧邦就把家搬到华沙去了。这位伟大的音乐家的童年是在华沙度过的，但是沃里亚的故居，却使萧邦异常地留恋与怀念。他常常回到这儿来，整天地在这林木蓊郁的花园里游玩。这花园里有一条小河，这就是那个纤细的安静的渥特拉河。河的两岸，丛生着树木和芦苇，它们那碧绿的天鹅绒般的影子，清晰地倒映在翡翠般的河面上。萧邦非常喜爱这条河，他常常坐在河边的树下，凝神地看着这静静的河流和那富有诗意的倒影。他有时到他住宅附近的农民家里去做客，在那里，他听到了很多农民们演奏的民间乐曲，这些粗犷而优美的旋律曾经久久地使他陶醉，并深深地刻进了他的记忆里。
    这所住宅之被发现是萧邦的出生地，还是1891年的事情。当时一位热爱萧邦的俄国作曲家巴拉基列夫，在离沃里亚十一公里的一座教堂里发现了萧邦的出生证明书，循着那上面的地址，他找到了这里。从那以后，萧邦家里的一些用具就被保存起来了。现在，这所住宅的一切陈设，都是按照萧邦出生时的样子。一进门口，就看见萧邦父亲的书房，那里在老式的书橱里，放着许多法文书籍。在萧邦母亲的房间里，墙上挂着一幅紫红色花纹的波兰壁毯，墙角上放着一只十七世纪的衣橱，另一边的墙角上立着一只古老的立钟，靠窗放着一架钢琴，这就是萧邦的母亲用的那一架钢琴。据说萧邦的母亲是一个很温柔的女人，她有着天才的禀赋，精通法文，而且是一个很好的钢琴家。年青时，她是一个很活泼的姑娘，常常和乡村的妇女们在一起唱歌跳舞。但是她很穷，自己没有财产，只得和外祖母两个人寄居在施卡尔别克伯爵的家里。
    萧邦母亲住房的隔壁，紧靠着花园，就是萧邦的外祖母的房间。在靠窗的一边，也放着一架大钢琴，这是星期天演奏会用的，每星期天的演奏会就在这个房间里举行，因为这个房间三面都有窗户，窗外就是花丛和草地，演奏者把门关起，一个人在屋子里演奏，人们都在窗户外面听。我来到这里不久，萧邦乐曲的演奏就开始了。那天演奏的人是来自华沙的钢琴家拉德法诺娃。她是一个雍容大方的少妇，慢腾腾地走进了那间房间，微笑着向窗子外面望了一眼，就在钢琴前面坐了下来，搓了搓手指。接着一声和谐的琴声从屋子里响了起来，立刻，空气中都充满了悦耳的音响，这一声独特的延长音，良久地在空气中颤抖着缭绕着，像一只在花丛间飞旋着的蜜蜂似的，那拖长的轻飘飘的微微震颤的音响，把人们引进了一个迷人的诗意般的意境中去。接着，有着浓厚的波兰民族风格的波兰舞曲开始了。这是萧邦青年时代的作品，随着这个乐曲的优美旋律，我们的面前展开了锦绣般壮丽的波兰山河的景色：我仿佛看到了春天的微风轻飘飘地吹过了广阔无垠的波兰田野，绿色的维斯杜拉河上的春潮轻轻地冲击着柔软的沙滩，那青蓝色的高耸入云的塔特里山上的积雪在明朗的阳光下面闪烁着镜子般的白光，那绿荫重重的褐色的乡村小道上卷过了一片白云似的羊群。……啊，我完全陶醉了，陶醉在这美妙的乐曲里，我的想像随着琴声飞驰到很远很远的地方去了。
    一曲告终，满园都欢跃起来了。
    当第二个乐曲开始时，欢乐的旋律变成了忧郁的低音。这是萧邦离开祖国时的一支送行曲。1830年11月2日，年青的萧邦怀着抑郁的心情离开他的祖国。临别时，朋友们送给他一只盛满了波兰泥土的银杯子，嘱咐他不管流浪到那里，都要把这只杯子带在身边，时时刻刻地纪念着自己底祖国的乡土。忧伤的离别曲在缠绵的低音里隐没了。间歇不久，古宅里又响起了暴风雨般的音响，这就是那有名的气势磅礴的革命练习曲。这支乐曲是1831年萧邦在由维也纳去巴黎的路上，在斯图加特城听到了华沙陷落的消息时，在极度悲愤中所创造出来的。人们告诉我：在萧邦离开祖国不久，华沙的起义就爆发了，被奴役的国家的心脏重新获得了自由。整个的波兰都动荡起来了，满怀着恋念祖国和痛恨侵略者的萧邦，在国外，也用他的钢琴参加了祖国的战斗，在这一时期里，他在自己创作的许多的乐曲里面，都表示了他对祖国的深切怀念和忠贞。可是，波兰的革命并没有继续多久，在沙皇部队的攻击下，1831年11月7日，华沙陷落了。那时，萧邦正从维也纳动身到巴黎去，走到斯图加特时，这不幸的消息传到了他的耳朵里，当时他几乎震惊得昏厥过去。
    也就在这一天，萧邦在琴上写出了著名的革命练习曲，把他的激愤之情，统统在这乐曲里强烈地表达出来了。那乐曲一开头的几声强重的不协和弦，就弹出了争自由的波兰在挣扎在怒吼；那暴雨似的翻滚着向下的琴音，就像被挣脱了的铁链，沉重地从奴隶的身上断落下去。接着，那连续的急奏，在我们的面前展开了惊心动魄万马奔腾的波兰武士追击敌人的画面。大地震动了，带着遍体鳞伤的波兰站起来了，挣扎着，战斗着，站起来了。但是它又在侵略者的军刀下面倒下去了，琴声转入了沉痛和哀伤。这凄凉的琴声，给听众的脸上罩上了阴云，心情沉重起来了。但是，哀伤的旋律很快地就消失了，乐曲又跳上了高吭的强音，它仿佛是一支响亮的洋溢着乐观热情的号角，吹起了震奋人心的战斗号音，人们的感情，立刻又兴奋活跃起来了。……
    乐曲在暴风雨般的高昂的急奏中结束了，我的心深深地为琴声所吸引，我很久地站在窗外的丁香树下，听着那袅袅的余音，一时间竟然梦幻似的忘却是身在何处了。
    演奏会结束了，聚集在窗外的人们开始活动起来，他们有的到花园各处去游玩，有的三一堆五一簇的在谈论着今天的演奏，谈论着萧邦的生平。在小河旁边的草地上，一群音乐小学的学生，正在聚精会神地听他们的女教师讲叙萧邦晚年的遭遇。那位女教师感情激动的告诉孩子们：萧邦在斯图加特听到了华沙陷落的消息以后，这个怀着亡国惨痛的艺术家，怀里紧紧地揣着盛满了波兰泥土的银杯，飘流到了花都巴黎。在这里，他消磨了他生命中最后的十八个年头。虽然他离开祖国越来越远了，但是他的音乐和感情，却和祖国越来越近。在这一时期里，他写出了许多热情豪迈永垂不朽的爱国乐曲。但是残酷无情的病魔夺去了他的健康，在长时期的缠绵病榻之后，终于在1849年10月17日，这位飘泊国外的天才音乐家，就结束了他那贫病交迫的生活而永远地离开人间了。一直到死，那只盛满了祖国泥土的银杯，还紧紧地放在萧邦的身边，萧邦死了以后，人们按照他的嘱咐：把这银杯里的波兰泥土，撒进了他的墓穴里。……
    我看得出，女教师的讲叙，在孩子们的心里，激起了什么样的情感。有几个孩子，出神地凝视着古宅的窗户，眼里闪烁着亮晶晶的泪光。啊，我的心也跳动起来了。关于萧邦的音乐和他的生平事迹，在我们国内，我听过已经不止一次了，可是它所给我的印象，却从来没有像今天这样的深刻，也从来没有像今天这样的使我感动。怀着敬仰和留恋的心情，我们离开了这座幽雅安静的美丽的古宅。在归来的路上，很长的时间里，我的耳膜里还在响着那暴风雨般的震撼心灵的琴声，脑幕上不断地映现着这位爱国的天才的近代音乐拓荒者的面影。……　寄于华沙（附图片）
