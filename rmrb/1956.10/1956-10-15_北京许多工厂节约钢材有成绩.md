Xinhua News Agency, October 12th: Various experiences and methods for conserving steel and using steel rationally are beginning to be widely adopted in Beijing's factories.

    The Liulihe Cement Plant needs a large number of steel balls to manufacture cement in its mills. The workers came up with a way to process and remanufacture used steel balls into good ones, saving more than 190 tons of steel in the first eight months of this year. In the machine repair workshop, during the major repairs of equipment such as cement kilns and cement mills in September, workers used scrap materials instead of new materials for spare parts, saving more than 53 tons of new steel in six days.

    Chen Yuan and Zhang Zongyuan, technical personnel in the structure department of the Fengtai Bridge Factory, modified the design of a 32-meter steel plate girder, reducing the number of interfaces on each beam from four to two without affecting the bridge's load-bearing capacity. The recent 12-arch bridge project saved more than 14 tons of steel plate.

    The Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory recently carried out the renovation of old and discarded tools, which can save tens of thousands of kilograms of high-quality steel used in tool manufacturing. The factory has now made a plan to take out about 10,000 old tools from the scrap tool warehouse, repair them slightly, and reuse them. These tools include valuable drill bits and high-speed steel tools.

    In addition, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Materials Supply has also organized the inter-factory adjustment of steel materials. Forty-three units have reported their urgently needed and temporarily unused steel materials to the Materials Supply Bureau, and more than 500 tons have already been exchanged. The Beijing Refrigeration Plant Preparatory Committee could not start construction due to the lack of round steel of various specifications, but it had 180 tons of section steel that was temporarily unused. The Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory and the Beijing Machinery Factory urgently needed section steel. After the Materials Supply Bureau coordinated the exchange, both parties' problems were solved.

    北京许多工厂节约钢材有成绩
    新华社12日讯　各种节约钢材和合理使用钢材的经验和方法，开始在北京市的工厂中广泛采用。
    琉璃河水泥厂制造水泥的磨机需要大量钢球，工人们想办法把废钢球加工制造成好钢球再用，今年八个月节省了一百九十多吨钢材。机修车间在9月份做水泥窑、水泥磨等设备大修配件中，工人们用废料加工代替新料，六天里就节省了新钢材五十三吨多。
    丰台桥梁工厂结构科技术人员陈渊、张宗远，修改了三十二公尺钢板梁的设计，在不影响桥梁承重的情况下，把每片梁的四个接口改为两个。最近工厂做的十二孔桥梁，就节省了十四吨多钢板。
    北京农业机械厂最近进行了旧废工具翻新工作，可以节省上万公斤制造工具的优质钢。现在，这个工厂已经做出计划，准备把废工具库里约一万件旧工具，拿出来稍加修理后重新利用。这些工具中包括贵重的钻头、高速钢工具。
    此外，北京市物资供应局还组织了工厂之间相互调剂钢材的工作。有四十三个单位已经把本单位急需的和暂时不用的钢材报告物资供应局，现在已经交换五百吨以上，北京冷藏库筹备委员会因为缺少各种规格的元钢不能开工，但是有一百八十吨型钢暂时不用，而北京农业机械厂、北京市机械厂急需要型钢，经过物资供应局从中调换，双方的问题都解决了。
