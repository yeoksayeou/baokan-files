    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Telegram　Many local industrial enterprises in Shenyang, with relatively poor equipment and backward technology, have rapidly improved their technical level and product quality by establishing technical assistance relationships with state-owned factories, advanced factories, scientific departments, or user units through various methods.
    The Shenyang Small Switch Factory was originally a factory producing civilian products. Later, it undertook the task of producing a complete set of electrical control equipment for machine tools. However, the factory lacked manufacturing experience in this area, and there were many technical problems that it could not solve on its own. Later, the factory established a technical assistance relationship with the state-owned Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory, which had expertise in this area, solving many difficult technical problems and successfully trial-producing more than one hundred new products. The Shenyang No. 2 Refractory Material Factory, with the help of Soviet experts and engineers from the Anshan Iron and Steel Refractory Material Factory, improved the batching and operating methods, reducing the scrap rate from over 16% to below 3%.
    Some factories, after establishing technical assistance relationships with user departments, not only improved product quality but also eliminated the phenomenon of uncoordination between production and user departments. In the past, the Shenyang Cultural and Educational Supplies Factory did not accept the Shenyang Institute of Physical Education's proposed improvements to the quality specifications of sports equipment. Therefore, the Shenyang Institute of Physical Education did not buy the factory's products. Now, the Shenyang Cultural and Educational Supplies Factory regularly and modestly asks the Shenyang Institute of Physical Education to conduct quality appraisals of sports equipment and immediately seeks to improve based on the appraisal opinions. Therefore, the factory's products have been welcomed by the Shenyang Institute of Physical Education.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, on the 10th, the Benxi Steel Plant and the Fushun Steel Plant signed a contract to jointly improve the technical level of the enterprises. The contract stipulates that both the Benxi Steel Plant and the Fushun Steel Plant should use their own manpower, materials, and experience to adopt various methods to vigorously help the other factory learn and promote advanced experience. This is a new form of combination for similar enterprises to learn from each other's strengths and improve together. The two factories stipulated that in the fourth quarter of this year, the Fushun Steel Plant would help the Benxi Steel Plant learn twenty-six kinds of advanced experience in steel rolling, steelmaking, steel forging, and heat treatment; the Benxi Steel Plant would help the Fushun Steel Plant learn fifteen kinds of advanced experience in steelmaking, steel rolling, steel forging, and heat treatment.
    The contract details the methods for helping the other factory learn advanced experience. In addition to providing each other with technical materials and drawings, the two factories will also send personnel to the other factory to systematically learn and impart experience in operation, systems, and equipment, working together until they and the other party have mastered the advanced experience before returning to their own factory. At the same time, both parties will do their best to provide the other factory with the equipment and tools needed to promote advanced experience.
    According to the contract, the Benxi Steel Plant and the Fushun Steel Plant will also concentrate their technical forces in the future to jointly study technical problems that neither factory has solved. For new technical achievements and new experiences appearing in the two factories, the contract stipulates that they should be exchanged or jointly studied in a timely manner through methods such as mailing and long-distance telephone calls.

    同先进企业和使用部门广泛建立技术协助关系以后
    沈阳地方工业产品质量迅速提高
    本溪抚顺两钢厂签订合同互相帮助共同提高
    新华社沈阳电　沈阳市不少设备较差，技术较落后的地方工业企业，由于采用各种方式同国营工厂、先进工厂、科学部门或使用单位建立技术协助关系，迅速地提高了技术水平，改进了产品质量。
    沈阳市小型开关厂原来是生产民用产品的工厂，后来承担了生产机床所用的全套电气控制设备的任务，但是这个厂缺乏这方面的制造经验，有许多技术问题自己不能解决。后来，这个厂同有专长的国营沈阳低压开关厂建立技术协助关系，解决了许多困难的技术问题，并且试制成功了一百多种新产品。沈阳市第二耐火材料厂得到鞍钢耐火材料厂的苏联专家和工程师的帮助，改进了配料和操作方法，使废品率由16％以上降低到3％以下。
    有的工厂同使用部门建立了技术协助关系以后，不仅提高了产品质量，并且消除了生产部门同使用部门不协调的现象。过去，沈阳市文教用品厂不接受沈阳体育学院对体育器材质量规格所提出的改进意见，因此，沈阳体育学院不买这个厂的产品，现在，沈阳市文教用品厂定期虚心地请沈阳体育学院对体育器材作质量鉴定，并且根据鉴定意见立即设法改进。因此，这个厂的产品受到了沈阳体育学院的欢迎。
    据新华社讯　本溪钢厂和抚顺钢厂10日签订了一份共同提高企业技术水平的合同。这份合同规定，本溪钢厂和抚顺钢厂都要以本厂的人力、物力和经验，采取各种办法，大力帮助对方工厂学习和推广先进经验。这是同类企业之间取长补短、共同提高的新的结合形式。两厂规定，在今年第四季度里，抚顺钢厂要帮助本溪钢厂在轧钢、炼钢、锻钢、热处理等方面，学习二十六种先进经验；本溪钢厂要在炼钢、轧钢、锻钢、热处理等方面帮助抚顺钢厂学习十五种先进经验。
    合同详细规定了帮助对方工厂学习先进经验的方法。这两个厂除了互相供给技术资料和图纸以外，还要派出人员到对方工厂去，在操作上、制度上、设备上系统地学习和传授经验，大家一起工作，一直到自己和对方掌握了先进经验才返回本厂。同时，双方还要尽自己力量，赠送对方工厂在推广先进经验中所需的设备和工具。
    按照合同，本溪钢厂和抚顺钢厂今后还将集中技术力量，共同研究两个厂都没有解决的技术问题。对于两厂出现的新的技术成就和新经验，合同规定要通过邮寄、长途电话等方法，及时交流或共同研究。
