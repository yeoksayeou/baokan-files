    Overcoming Material Shortages Through Ingenuity
    Northwest Fifth Engineering Company Exceeds National Plan
    (By Our Correspondent) The Northwest Engineering Management Bureau's Fifth Engineering Company has actively found ways to overcome difficulties in the face of national material shortages since the second quarter of this year, and exceeded the national plan in July and August.
    Since the second quarter of this year, many construction units in the Xi'an area have been complaining about material shortages, and some projects have been halted due to insufficient material supply. As a result, most construction units failed to complete their plans in the first half of the year. The materials supplied by the state to the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau's Fifth Engineering Company were also very limited, only accounting for 60% of their actual needs, with steel being particularly scarce. In order to overcome the difficulty of material shortages, they actively sought solutions and found substitutes everywhere. For example, in August, they needed 337 tons of steel, but the material supply company only supplied a dozen tons. The company's purchasing personnel went to various fraternal companies to inquire whether there was any surplus or temporarily unused steel, and requested adjustment or borrowing through the Northwest Materials Company. They also collected a portion of the remaining steel from units they had contracted with in the past. If the specifications of the collected steel were not suitable for their needs, they tried to transfer it with other units or use it as a substitute after modification.
    The company also established a small waste material processing plant. The factory workers pieced together small pieces of wood selected from waste wood to make parquet floors and roof panels. Currently, this company is manufacturing its own pulverizers in order to use raw materials such as lime to manufacture non-clinker cement, solving the difficulty of insufficient cement supply.
    In order to avoid idling or shutdowns caused by temporary material shortages, the company established a reporting system. Each work area and construction site must report the material arrival and material consumption to the company every day. Since the company has a comprehensive understanding of the situation, it allocates materials between various work areas through dispatch telephone. When necessary, it also appropriately changes the project items.

    多动脑筋克服材料不足的困难
    西北第五工程公司超额完成国家计划
    本报讯　西北工程管理总局第五工程公司今年第二季度以来，在国家材料供应不足的情况下，主动想办法克服困难，七、八月份超额完成了国家计划。
    今年第二季度以来，西安地区很多建筑单位都在叫喊材料不足，有些工程则因材料供应不足停了工，因而上半年大部分建筑单位都没有完成计划。国家供给西北工程管理总局第五工程公司的材料也很少，只相当于他们实际需要量的60％，尤其是钢材最感缺乏。为了克服材料不足的困难，他们主动想办法，到处寻找来源、搞代用品。如8月份他们需要钢材三百三十七吨，材料供应公司只供给了十几吨，公司采购人员就到各兄弟公司去了解有无多余的或暂时用不着的钢材，通过西北材料公司请求调剂或借用。他们又到过去承包过的单位那里搜集了一部分剩余钢材。搜集来的钢材规格如不适合需要，他们就想办法和别的单位调用或改制后代用。
    公司特别还成立了一个小型废料加工厂。工厂工人们把从废木料中挑选出来的小木头拼在一起，制成拼花地板和屋面板。目前，这个公司正在自己制造粉磨机，以便用石灰等原料制造无熟料水泥，解决水泥供应不足的困难。
    为了不因材料一时供应不上而造成窝工或停工，公司内部建立了汇报制度，各工区、工地每天都要把材料进场和材料耗用情况向公司汇报，公司既然掌握了全面情况，就通过调度电话调拨各工区之间的材料。必要时，还适当变动工程项目。
