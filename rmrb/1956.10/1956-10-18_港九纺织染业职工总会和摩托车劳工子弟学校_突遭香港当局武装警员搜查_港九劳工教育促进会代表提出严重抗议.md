Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th: Hong Kong News: On the morning of the 16th, from around 11:30 AM to 2:40 PM, armed police officers and plainclothes detectives from the British Hong Kong police searched the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile Dyeing Industry Workers' General Union and the Motorcycle Labor Children's School. They searched these two locations for three hours and took away all self-defense equipment. In total, the Hong Kong police dispatched dozens of inspectors, detectives, and armed police officers during the search.

The search of the Textile Dyeing Industry Workers' General Union lasted from around 11:30 AM to 2:30 PM. Initially, plainclothes detectives guarded the entrance, allowing workers to enter but not leave. Then, a group of armed police officers arrived. As soon as they entered, they ordered all workers lying on the floor and sitting on wooden benches to get up and not move, before conducting the search. They confiscated all self-defense tools carried by the workers, such as triangular files, and then gathered several soda bottles filled with water placed in the veranda and took them away. Also taken away were a first-aid kit containing medicine, teacups, and bamboo crate covers.

At the time, there were approximately 110 workers inside, about 90 men and 20 women. Some workers asked the police to guarantee the workers' safety if they took away their self-defense tools. At this point, a police officer raised a loaded rifle and threatened the workers, saying, "Why are you making such a fuss!"

The Motorcycle Labor Children's School was searched from around 11:35 AM to 2:40 PM. During the search, the Hong Kong police controlled the telephone, preventing school staff from contacting the outside.

Initially, a British plainclothes inspector knocked on the door. The guard said that he needed to notify the person in charge before opening the door. However, the inspector cursed and pried open the lock. Then, a group of armed police officers wearing helmets rushed into the school, fully armed as if facing a major enemy. At the time, there were more than 40 school staff, including teachers, student guards, parents, and employees, most of whom were eating. As soon as the police entered, they ordered everyone to gather in one classroom. The school staff said to the police, "We are not criminals, there is no need to gather us." The police officer angrily swept the food and dishes off the table onto the floor, ordering everyone to stay put and wait for the search. As a result, the police searched and took away more than a dozen triangular files, six or seven iron rods, more than fifty small packets of lime, as well as teacups, flashlights, and other items.

School staff told the police, "At 4:00 AM on October 11, we were attacked by more than 400 rioters. They threw stones, and many doors and windows were hit. We reported it to the police at the time, and the police are aware of this. At that time, the rioters threatened to beat us, and we had to defend ourselves."

At the time, a police officer made an empty promise, guaranteeing the safety of the school in the future. He said, "The superintendent is here, can't he guarantee it?" Then, another British police officer claimed to be the superintendent.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th: Hong Kong News: The Hong Kong and Kowloon Labor Education Promotion Association sent representatives to visit the Hong Kong police authorities at 4:00 PM on the 16th to lodge a serious protest with the Hong Kong police authorities regarding the sudden search of the Motorcycle Labor Children's School and the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile Dyeing Industry Workers' General Union on the 16th.

During the meeting with Deputy Commissioner of Police Byminder, the representatives pointed out that the police had failed to take timely responsibility to stop the entire time when Kuomintang special agents directed the rioters to commit violence. Under the circumstances of being attacked by rioters, workers and students' parents had risen up in self-defense. After the riots, it was completely reasonable for them to carry some self-defense tools to school to protect the lives and property of school personnel. The representatives expressed serious protest against the unreasonable measures taken by the British Hong Kong police in this search, and at the same time put forward four demands to the British Hong Kong police authorities:

(1) Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future;

(2) The police must guarantee the safety of the lives and property of our workers and their organizations;

(3) The police are responsible for compensating for the damaged school equipment;

(4) The items taken by the police should be returned immediately.

Deputy Commissioner of Police Byminder then stated that the Federation of Trade Unions and trade unions had done the right thing in this riot. He promised to consider the demands put forward by the representatives. Byminder also stated that the police would definitely take responsibility for maintaining social order, and the situation of "no one available to dispatch in case of emergency" would not happen again.

    港九纺织染业职工总会和摩托车劳工子弟学校
    突遭香港当局武装警员搜查
    港九劳工教育促进会代表提出严重抗议
    新华社广州17日电　香港消息：16日上午十一时三十分左右至下午二时四十分左右，香港英国警方武装警员和便衣警探搜查了港九纺织染业职工总会和摩托车劳工子弟学校。他们在这两个地方搜查了三个小时，把一切自卫器具都带走。在搜查中，香港警方总共出动了几十个帮办、警探和武装警员。
    纺织染业职工总会被搜查的时间由十一点三十分至两点三十分左右。起初由便衣警探把守门口，只准工人入内，不准工人外出。接着来了一批武装警员，他们一进门，就命令睡在地板上和木凳上的所有工人起身，不准动，而后进行搜查。他们把工人携带的自卫工具三角锉等全部搜出，然后又把放在骑楼的几个装水的汽水瓶集中在一起带走。被带走的还有装药物的十字箱、茶杯和箩盖。
    当时在屋内的工人约一百一十人左右，其中男的约九十人，女的约二十人。有些工人曾向警方提出：把工人的自卫工具带走，警方要保证工人的生命安全。这时候，有个警员举起实弹的长枪威胁工人说：“这样吵干什么！”
    摩托车劳工子弟学校被搜的时间是上午十一时三十五分至下午二时四十分左右。在搜查时，香港警方控制电话，不准守校人员和外面联系。
    最初是个英籍便衣帮办拍门，守门者说要通知负责人后才能开门。但那帮办大骂，并把门锁撬开。接着和一批头戴钢盔的武装警员冲入校内，荷枪实弹如临大敌。当时守校的人员包括教师、护校学生和家长、职工共四十多人，大部分人正在吃饭。警察们一进门就命令所有人集中到一个课室去。守校人员向警方说：“我们不是犯人，毋须集中。”警员竟怒气冲冲地把饭台的饭和菜扫落地上，命令就地不动，等候搜查。结果被警方搜出和带走的东西有三角锉十多只、铁支六、七条、石灰五十多小包，此外还有茶杯、电筒等物。
    学校人员对警员说：“我们在10月11日凌晨四时被四百多暴徒袭击，他们掷石头，许多门窗被击中，当时曾报警，警方是知道的。那时候，暴徒们扬言要打我们，我们不能不起来自卫。”
    当时一个警员空口许诺，保证这个学校今后的安全，他说：“这里有总警司在，还不能保证？”接着，另一个英籍警方人员自称他就是某某总警司。
    新华社广州17日电　香港消息：港九劳工教育促进会16日下午四时派代表往访香港警务当局，就摩托车劳工子弟学校和港九纺织染业职工总会在16日突然被搜查的事件，向香港警察当局提出严重抗议。
    代表们在与警务处副处长必明达会见时指出，由于警方在国民党特务分子指挥暴徒行凶的整个时间并没有能够及时负责制止。在他们遭受暴徒袭击的情况下，工人和学生的家长曾经起而自卫。在暴乱事件发生后，他们携带一些自卫用具来学校，保卫学校人员的生命财产，是完全合情合理的。代表们对香港英国警方这一搜查的不合情理的措施，表示严重抗议，同时向香港英国警察当局提出了四项要求：
    （一）保证以后不再发生同类事件；
    （二）警方必须保证我们工人及其机构生命财产的安全；
    （三）毁坏的学具要警方负责赔偿；
    （四）警方收去的物品应即发还。
    警务处副处长必明达接着表示，在这次暴乱事件中，工联、工会的做法是对的。他答应考虑代表提出的这些要求。必明达还表示，警方对维持社会秩序必将负起责任，“告急而无人可派”的情况将不会再发生。
