Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 11th: Hong Kong news: A major disturbance occurred in the Kowloon area from 11:30 AM on the 10th to the morning of the 11th. Kuomintang secret agents gathered thousands of rioters to systematically and deliberately set fire to schools, shops, and residences, commit murder, and engage in large-scale looting, causing serious losses to people's lives and property.

During the disturbance, Kuomintang secret agents traveled back and forth in cars to direct operations, and hundreds of bicycle teams bearing Kuomintang flags moved to and fro within the riotous crowds to maintain communication.

On the 10th, both during the day and at night, the rioters set fire to the Resettlement Affairs Office in the resettlement areas of Li Zhengwu Village, Shek Kip Mei, and Kowloon Tsai, destroying documents. After 11:00 PM on the 10th, the area of the riots expanded. At that time, Kuomintang elements started actions again in the Kowloon Tsai resettlement area on Boundary Street, charging into residents’ homes in the resettlement buildings, seizing furniture, throwing it at the ground police, and taking advantage of the situation to loot property.

At 2:00 AM today, hundreds of Kuomintang secret agents and rioters forcibly broke into the newly built campus of Heung To Middle School in the Kowloon Tsai area and set it on fire. Before storming into the school to set the fire, the staff of Heung To Middle School had confronted the rioters surrounding the school for more than two hours and had repeatedly called the Hong Kong police authorities for assistance. The Hong Kong police authorities replied that they were aware of the situation but could not provide assistance.

The old campus of this middle school was also attacked by rioters. At 2:00 AM on the 11th, the old campus was still surrounded by rioters and was set on fire. The school staff worked together to resolutely resist, and the rioters never managed to break into the school.

Many shops, businesses, and street residents were attacked and robbed by rioters. The Garden Company bakery on Castle Peak Road in Kowloon was burned down. All the goods of the Xinzhong Native Produce Food Company, Dafeng Native Produce Food Company, and Yilong Native Produce Food Company were looted by the rioters. The Chow Sang Sang gold shop, a larger store next door to the Xinzhong Native Produce Food Company, was also broken into and robbed by rioters.

The most prosperous areas of Kowloon, such as Nathan Road and Shanghai Street, were also harassed by rioters in the early hours of today. Many residents were pelted with stones, and cars passing through Nathan Road were not spared.

In Sham Shui Po, Mong Kok, and Yau Ma Tei in Kowloon, the addresses of some labor unions were pelted with stones by rioters, and rioters even broke down doors and stormed into the union buildings to create disturbances.

The rioters did not even spare maternity patients. The Workers' Confinement Center on Shanghai Street in Mong Kok was also harassed and pelted with stones.

Due to the harassment and destruction by rioters, traffic on some streets fell into serious chaos. After 10:00 PM on the 10th, buses on several routes passing through Castle Peak Road were blocked and could not pass. Buses stopped at the mouth of Tai Po Road after traffic was interrupted were pelted with huge stones by rioters, and passengers were forced to get off and were subjected to interrogation and beatings. Some vehicles were intercepted by rioters at the mouth of Tai Po Road, and after forcing the passengers to get off, the rioters set the vehicles on fire.

The British police authorities in Hong Kong used tear gas in the disturbance zone in the resettlement areas, but were unable to quickly stop the development of the situation. The chaos and terror in the vast areas of Kowloon continued until after 6:00 AM on the 11th. The measures taken by the Hong Kong British police authorities have not been able to stop the development of this terror incident.

As of now, there are no accurate statistics on the number of people killed and injured and the amount of property lost due to the secret agent riots.

    国民党特务分子在九龙制造大暴乱
    万余匪徒进行大规模抢劫猖狂放火杀人
    骚乱迄未被制止并有向香港发展的趋势
    新华社广州11日电　香港消息：在10日上午十一时三十分到11日早晨，九龙地区发生大骚动。国民党特务分子纠集数千暴徒有组织有计划地向学校、商店和居民纵火、杀人，并进行大规模的劫掠，造成人民生命财产的严重损失。
    在骚动过程中，国民党特务分子分乘着汽车往来指挥，数以百计的插着国民党旗帜的自行车队在骚动队伍中来回连络。
    暴徒们于10日的白天和晚上，分别在九龙李郑屋村、石硖尾、九龙仔几处、徙置区的徙置事务处纵火，将文件烧毁。暴乱地区在10日下午十一时后，越来越扩大。当时国民党分子在界限街九龙仔徙置区再一次开始行动，冲上徙置大厦的民舍夺取家具，掷击地面警察，并趁此进行抢劫财物。
    今日凌晨两点钟，数以百计的国民党特务分子和暴徒强行冲进九龙仔地区的香岛中学新建的校舍进行纵火。在冲入校舍纵火以前，香岛中学的员工曾和围在校外的暴徒相持两个多钟头，并曾数度用电话向香港警察当局求援，香港警察当局答复说，已经知道这事，但说无法赴援。
    这个中学的旧校舍也遭到暴徒的袭击。11日凌晨二时旧校舍还在暴徒的包围中，并被纵火，学校的员工合力坚决抵抗，暴徒们始终没有冲进校舍。
    许多商店、企业和街道居民遭到暴徒袭击和抢劫。九龙青山道的嘉顿制饼公司被纵火烧毁。新中土产食品公司、大丰土产食品公司和益隆土产食品公司的所有货物都被暴徒们抢掠一空。新中土产食品公司隔邻一家规模较大的周生生金铺也被暴徒打开铁闸进内抢劫。
    九龙最繁盛的弥顿道及上海街等地区，在今日凌晨也被暴徒骚扰。很多居民被石头掷击，驶经弥顿道的汽车也不能幸免。
    九龙深水埗、旺角以及油麻地等处，有些工会住址被暴徒用石块掷击，暴徒并曾毁门冲进工会屋内捣乱。
    暴徒对产妇也不放过。旺角上海街的工人留产所也被骚扰和掷击。
    由于暴徒的骚扰破坏，有些街道上的交通陷入严重的混乱状态。10日晚上10时以后，驶经青山道的几条路线的公共汽车都因受阻不能通行。交通中断后停在大埔道口的公共汽车，被暴徒用巨大石块掷击，车上搭客被迫下车并遭受盘查和殴打。其中有些车辆驶到大埔道口时，被暴徒截住，暴徒在强迫搭客下车后即纵火烧车。
    香港英国警察当局在徙置区骚扰地带，曾经施放了催泪弹，但是没有能够迅速制止事态的发展。九龙广大地区的混乱及恐怖状态，一直延续到11日晨六时多。香港英国警察当局所采取的措施一直没有能够制止这一恐怖事件的发展。
    由于特务暴乱而死伤的人数以及财物的损失，到目前为止还没有确切的统计。
