    Sino-Japanese Children Exchange Drawings
    On October 6th of this year, a Japanese cargo ship docked at the Tanggu New Port wharf. Among the people on board was Mr. Fukumoto Gimitsu. He brought eleven color drawings. These drawings were gifts from the students of the Kayade Elementary School in Ashoro, Hokkaido, Japan to the Chinese elementary school students. Among them were "Autumn Landscape" painted by Ikeda Mitsuyo, a twelve-year-old sixth-grade student; "Cleaning in the Classroom" painted by Kubota Makoto and two other eight-year-old third-grade students; and "A Group of Elementary School Students Playing in the Park" painted by Yuan Ashi, a six-year-old first-grade student. The content is lively and delightful. Along with the drawings came the Japanese elementary school students' request to be friends with Chinese elementary school students.
    When the elementary school students in Tanggu District, Tianjin, learned about this news, they were extremely happy. In order to express their willingness to be friends with the Japanese elementary school students and establish friendship, many children sent their own excellent drawings to the Japanese elementary school students. Among them were "Defending Peace" painted by the sixth-grade class two students of Tanggu District Central Elementary School; "Our Teacher Lenin" painted by Shen Dezhi, a fourteen-year-old sixth-grade student of Mingxing Elementary School; a large red radish painted by a five-year-old child from the kindergarten class of Tanggu District Central Elementary School; and "Happy Bonfire Party" painted by the sixth-grade students of Donggu Elementary School, totaling seventeen drawings. These drawings were handed over to Mr. Fukumoto Gimitsu on October 11th. He said that he would definitely pass the drawings of the Chinese children on to the Japanese children, and prepare to exhibit these drawings in Japanese schools, so that more Japanese children could see the drawings of the Chinese children.

    中日儿童交换图画
    今年10月6日，一艘日本货轮停泊在塘沽新港码头。随船的人当中，有一位福本仪光先生。他带来了十一张彩色图画。这些图画是日本北海道足寄地方的茅登小学的学生赠送给中国小学生的。其中有六年级十二岁的小学生池田光代画的“秋天风景”；三年级八岁小学生洼田诚等三人画的“在教室内打扫”；一年级六岁小学生袁足画的“一群小学生在公园里游戏”。内容生动喜人。随着图画还带来了日本小学生的要求，他们希望和中国小学生做朋友。
    当这个消息被天津市塘沽区的小学生们知道后，都喜欢的不得了，为了表示愿意和日本小学生做朋友，建立友谊，许多小朋友把自己亲手画的优秀的图画送给日本小学生。其中有塘沽区中心小学六年级二班小学生画的“保卫和平”；明星小学六年级十四岁沈德志画的“我们的导师列宁”；塘沽区中心小学幼儿班五岁儿童画的大红萝卜；东沽小学六年级小学生画的“快乐的营火会”。共计十七张。这些图画已在10月11日交给福本仪光先生。他表示一定要把中国小朋友们的画转交给日本小朋友，并准备把这些画在日本学校里展览出来，让更多的日本小朋友能够看到中国小朋友的图画。
