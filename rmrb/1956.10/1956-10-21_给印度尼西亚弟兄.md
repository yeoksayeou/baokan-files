To Indonesian Brothers
    Liu Lanshan

    Recently, while rummaging through old manuscripts at the bottom of a box, I found a piece I wrote in November 25, 1945, in the Central Plains Military Region. It was a song I wrote at the time to celebrate the eternal and immortal fighting friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people. On a night when the fierce battle had just ended, I stood on the summit of Dabie Mountain, gazing south. Heroic Indonesian brothers, I saw you raise your knives and guns from the palm groves. Towards the Dutch colonial army with their hands stained with blood, towards the Western bandits who crossed the sea, shoot, shoot, shoot, don't let them run rampant in your homeland again! In these dense mountains and forests, we are lighting the flames of victory celebration. Across the high mountains and seas, we can also hear your cheers during the battle. I want to make my fiery heart grow wings, carrying the friendship of the fighting people of Dabie Mountain, flying to the palm groves shaded by green trees, and singing loudly for your free tomorrow.

    给印度尼西亚弟兄
    刘岚山
    最近翻阅箱底旧稿，发现1945年11月25日在中原军区旧作一首，是我当时写来歌颂中国人民和印度尼西亚人民永远不朽的战斗的友情的。在激战刚刚结束的夜晚，我站在大别山顶向着南方眺望，英雄的印度尼西亚弟兄，我望见你们从棕榈林里举起了刀枪。向着满手是血的荷兰殖民军，向着渡海而来的西方强盗，射击吧，射击吧，射击吧，不让他们再横行在你们的家乡！在这密密的山林里，我们正燃起庆祝胜利的火光，隔着高山大海，也听得见你们在战斗中发出欢呼的声浪。我要叫火热的心生起双翅，带着战斗的大别山人民的友情，飞到那绿荫遮天的棕榈林里，为你们的自由的明天放声歌唱。
