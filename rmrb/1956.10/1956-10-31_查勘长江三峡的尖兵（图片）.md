    Pioneers Surveying the Yangtze River Three Gorges
    A large number of geological personnel are conducting detailed geological and hydrological surveys in the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River to provide reliable data for the comprehensive utilization and river basin planning of the Yangtze River. They appear under cliffs and precipices, and carry out exploration work in the valleys where clouds and rain come and go suddenly. When they lose their way, they light campfires on the tops of the mountains to spend the cold nights. When they go deep into the rock caves (sinkholes in geological engineering), they endure the biting cold. For the development of the Yangtze River, they contribute all their strength.

    Sinkholes—more than 200 of these rock caves, which have been eroded by groundwater for a long time, exist in the Three Gorges. If these sinkholes are not discovered, they will leak water after the large reservoir is built, and may also cause other disasters.

    查勘长江三峡的尖兵
    大批地质人员正在长江三峡进行地质和水文的详细查勘，给长江综合利用流域规划提供可靠的资料。他们出没在悬崖峭壁下，在忽云忽雨的峡谷中进行勘探工作，在失迷路途的时候，他们在山头上烧起了营火，度过寒夜，在深入岩洞（地质工程上的溶洞）时，更忍受着澈骨的寒冷。为了长江的开发，他们贡献出自己的全部力量。

    溶洞——这个被地水长期浸蚀成的岩洞，在三峡有二百多个。这些溶洞如不发现它，在建成大水库后，就会从这里漏水，也可能酿成其它灾害。
    六十岁的老人——三峡勘探大队总工程师盛莘夫（前），老当益壮，和小伙子们一起翻山越岭，指导他们的查勘工作。
