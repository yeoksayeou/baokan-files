Xinhua News Agency, October 8th: According to a report by the Yugoslav News Agency: The Yugoslav newspaper "Borba" published a commentary on the 7th regarding the recent private visits between Tito and Khrushchev, stating that these visits themselves reflect the high level of development that Yugoslav-Soviet relations have reached, and confirm that cooperation between the two countries is proceeding smoothly in accordance with the consistently democratic principles stipulated in a series of Yugoslav-Soviet documents.

"Borba" expressed its belief that the Yugoslav-Soviet cooperation, which has progressed smoothly to this day, has all the conditions to achieve further development. It said that in addition to the broad agreement on international issues, it is not surprising that there are still some differences in views on the current world situation, especially differences of an ideological nature. These differences are particularly reflected in the views on the socialist forces and factors in the current level of world development. There are also some unresolved issues in mutual relations.

The "Borba" commentator said that discussions on these differences of opinion are being conducted openly on an equal footing, and solutions that meet current needs are being sought through direct exchange of opinions. This is the guarantee for the smooth development of Yugoslav-Soviet relations.

　　铁托和赫鲁晓夫最近的相互访问
    反映苏南关系发展达到很高水平
    南斯拉夫“战斗报”的评论
    据新华社8日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社报道：南斯拉夫“战斗报”7日就铁托和赫鲁晓夫之间最近互相进行的私人访问发表评论说，这些访问的本身反映了南—苏关系的发展已达到很高的水平，并且证实两国之间的合作正在顺利地按照一系列的南—苏文件所规定的一贯民主的原则发展着。
    “战斗报”表示相信，顺利地进行到今天的南—苏合作，有一切条件来取得进一步的发展。它说，除了对国际问题的见解有广泛的相同之处以外，对目前世界的看法还存在着某些分歧，尤其是意识形态性质的分歧，这是不足为奇的。这些分歧特别表现在对世界目前发展水平上的社会主义力量和因素的看法上。在相互关系中也存在着某些悬而未决的问题。
    “战斗报”评论员说，关于这些分歧的见解的会谈正在平等的基础上公开地进行，并且正通过直接交换意见来寻求符合当前需要的解决办法。这就是南—苏关系顺利发展的保证。
