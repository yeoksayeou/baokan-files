Xinhua News Agency, Zibo, 25th. The Shandong Provincial Industrial Bureau Pesticide Plant, with only 300 production workers, is now producing over 120 tons of various pesticides daily. From January of this year to the present, this factory has produced over 21,700 tons of pesticides and fumigants for rural areas and grain departments.

From January to September this year, the factory's pesticide output increased by 51% compared to the same period last year. The entire factory reached the 1957 total output value level one year and three months ahead of schedule.

Currently, in addition to manufacturing various concentrations of dust and wettable "666," this factory also produces large quantities of fumigant—chloropicrin—for killing grain storage pests. The new pesticide "Lindane," which began production this autumn, can kill underground pests on 120 mu of land per kilogram, and is even more welcomed by agricultural producers' cooperatives in various regions.

In addition to supplying grain and cotton producing areas in Shandong, the large quantities of pesticides produced by this factory are also sold to Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces.

    山东省工业厅农药厂今年生产两万多吨农药
    据新华社淄博25日电　只有三百个生产工人的山东省工业厅农药厂，现在每天生产出的各种农药已达一百二十吨以上。从今年1月到现在，这个工厂已经为农村和粮食部门生产了两万一千七百多吨农药和熏蒸剂。
    这个工厂今年1月份到9月份的农药产量比去年同期增加了51％。全厂提前一年零三个月达到了1957年的总产值水平。
    现在，这个厂除能制造各种含量的粉剂和可湿性“六六六”外，还大量生产杀除粮仓害虫用的熏蒸剂——氯化苦。今年秋季开始生产的新农药“灵丹”，每公斤可以杀除一百二十亩地的地下害虫，更受到各地农业生产合作社的欢迎。
    这个工厂生产的大量农药除了供应山东粮、棉产区以外，还运销河南、河北、江苏、安徽和浙江等省。
