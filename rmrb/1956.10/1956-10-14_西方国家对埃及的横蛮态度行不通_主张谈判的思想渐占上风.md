Xinhua News Agency, New York, 12th: TASS reports: The Security Council is holding secret meetings on the Suez issue. According to information currently available to reporters, it can be said that the idea of negotiation has slowly gained the upper hand over efforts to dictate to Egypt and infringe upon Egyptian sovereignty.

Outside the United Nations and in the American press, some have pointed out that Western countries have been forced to slightly change their attitude. The "Washington Post and Times Herald" believes this change is a concession to taking a realistic attitude towards the Suez issue.

According to reporters' sources, the current secret meetings and talks are not discussing the "internationalization" or "international management" of the canal, but rather the establishment of an institution that will cooperate with the Egyptian Canal Authority. Therefore, the question now is how to correctly combine the interests of the sovereign state of Egypt with the legitimate interests of the countries using the Suez Canal.

It is pointed out here that the drafters of the Anglo-French proposal are no longer very enthusiastic about it.

There are some sober voices in the American newspapers that welcome a more realistic attitude in dealing with the Suez issue, namely, not treating the issue as one of canal management or control, but as a practical issue of ensuring the freedom of navigation on the canal for ships flying all flags. A typical example of this is an article by Lippmann published in the "New York Herald Tribune" on October 11. Lippmann pointed out that Egypt's proposals have made it possible to reach an agreement on establishing a cooperative system between canal users and the Egyptian management authority, as well as an institution to handle appeals related to the use of this waterway. Lippmann wrote that the great benefit of an agreement reached along these lines is that it would be endorsed by Western countries, as well as by Egypt, India, and the Soviet Union, and the canal management system would be universal. He also emphasized that this solution is not a defeat for Britain and France, as London and Paris might think; on the contrary, it would ultimately be beneficial to them. According to Lippmann, to achieve such a solution, Western countries must completely abandon their demands for managing the canal and "international control."

However, in addition to the emergence of some more realistic attitudes towards the Suez issue, there are also tendencies that will only hinder future negotiations and create additional difficulties for a positive resolution of the Suez issue. For example, some advocate replacing the 1888 Convention with an agreement between Egypt and an exclusive association, which does not represent the interests of the seventy-five to eighty canal-using countries, but only the interests of a small handful of countries.

At the same time, there are attempts to give the "supervisory body" the power to "use sanctions on its own," which would make this body not an institution that cooperates with the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority, but rather a kind of supreme authority, thereby causing Egypt to lose sovereignty over the canal.

It is quite obvious that such tendencies cannot promote the success of negotiations, nor can they promote the only possible solution to the Suez issue, which is to respect Egypt's sovereignty while ensuring the interests of all users of the Suez Canal.

### 西方国家对埃及的横蛮态度行不通  主张谈判的思想渐占上风

    西方国家对埃及的横蛮态度行不通
    主张谈判的思想渐占上风
    据新华社13日讯　塔斯社纽约12日讯：安全理事会正在就苏伊士问题举行秘密会议。根据记者目前所获得的情况，可以说主张谈判的思想已经慢慢地占了向埃及发号施令和侵犯埃及主权的努力的上风。
    在联合国会外和美国报界都有人指出，西方国家已经被迫稍许改变了它们的态度，“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”认为这种改变是对苏伊士问题采取现实态度的让步。
    据记者们的消息，目前举行的秘密会议和会谈并不是讨论运河的“国际化”或者“国际管理”，而是讨论建立一个将同埃及运河管理机构合作的机构的问题。因此，现在的问题是如何把埃及主权国家的利益同使用苏伊士运河的国家的合法利益正确结合起来。
    据这里指出，英法提案的草拟人已经不对这个提案十分热心。
    在美国报纸上有一些清醒的言论，它们欢迎采取比较现实的态度来处理苏伊士问题，就是不把这个问题作为对运河管理或者管制的问题来处理，而是作为一个保证悬挂一切国旗的船只在运河上自由通航的实际问题来处理。10月11日“纽约先驱论坛报”刊载的李普曼的一篇评论就是这方面的一个典型例子。李普曼指出，埃及的建议已经使得有可能在建立运河使用国同埃及管理机构之间的合作制度上，以及建立一个处理有关使用这一水道的申诉的机构问题上达成协议。李普曼写道，按照这种方针所达成的协议的巨大好处是，它会得到西方国家的赞同，同样也会得到埃及、印度和苏联的赞同，而运河的管理制度将是普遍性的。他还强调指出，这种解决办法并不像伦敦和巴黎可能会认为的那样是英国和法国的一种失败，相反地，对于他们来说，最后算起来还是有利的。按照李普曼的意见，要实现这样的解决，西方国家必须完全放弃他们对管理运河和“国际管制”的要求。
    但是，在对待苏伊士问题上除了出现一些比较现实的态度的迹象以外，也有只会阻碍今后谈判以及对苏伊士问题的积极解决造成额外困难的倾向。例如，有人主张用埃及同一个排他性协会之间的协定来代替1888年公约，这个排他性协会并不代表七十五个到八十个运河使用国的利益，而只代表一小撮国家的利益。
    同时，有人企图让“监督机构”拥有“自行使用制裁”的这种权力，这种权力会使这个机构成为一个不是同埃及苏伊士运河管理机构进行合作的机构而是某种最高机构，这样就会使埃及丧失运河的主权。
    十分明显，这种倾向不能促进谈判获得成功，也不能促使苏伊士问题获得唯一可能的解决，这种解决就是既尊重埃及的主权又保证一切苏伊士运河使用国的利益。
