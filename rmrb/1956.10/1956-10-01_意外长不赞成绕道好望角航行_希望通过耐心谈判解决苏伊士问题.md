Xinhua News Agency, dispatch from Paris, 30th: TASS reports from Paris on the 29th: Italian Foreign Minister Martino, in an interview with a reporter from the Paris newspaper "Le Figaro," expressed surprise at the Western countries' criticism of Italy's decision to pay Suez Canal transit fees to Egypt.

Martino emphasized that Italy was not consulted when the plan to establish the so-called "Suez Canal Users Association" was proposed.

Martino said: "We are united with other users, but this unity is not for provoking war, nor for endorsing all the measures that the United States, Britain, and France might take."

Martino added: "We believe that sailing around the Cape of Good Hope is a bad idea. This practice of wasting time and money amounts to sanctioning the users themselves. We must be realistic. We cannot be asked to gather all our ships and force them to detour around Africa. No country is willing to do this. For Italy's economic lifeline, this is a matter of life and death."

The Italian Foreign Minister finally expressed his hope that the Suez issue could be resolved through "patient negotiations."

    意外长不赞成绕道好望角航行
    希望通过耐心谈判解决苏伊士问题
    新华社30日讯　塔斯社巴黎29日讯：意大利外交部长马蒂诺在对巴黎“费加罗报”记者发表的谈话中，对西方国家责备意大利决定向埃及缴纳苏伊士运河通行费一事表示惊讶。
    马蒂诺强调指出，提出成立所谓“运河使用国协会”计划的时候并没有同意大利商量。
    马蒂诺说：“我们同其他使用国是团结的，但是，这种团结不是为了挑起战争，也不是为了赞同美英法三国可能采取的一切措施。”
    马蒂诺又说：“我们认为绕道好望角航行，这是不好的主张。这种浪费时间和金钱的做法等于制裁使用国自己。必须实事求是。不能要求我们征集我们的一切船只并且强迫它们绕道非洲。任何一个国家都不愿意这样做。对于意大利的经济来源，这是个生死问题。”
    意大利外交部长最后表示希望苏伊士问题能够通过“耐心谈判”的方式解决。
