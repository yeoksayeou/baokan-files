Xinhua News Agency, 4th. President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia was invited this afternoon to deliver a speech at an enlarged joint meeting held between the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, and the Standing Committee for the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

    The enlarged joint meeting was held in the Huairen Hall in Zhongnanhai. At 2:15 PM, President Sukarno and the senior officials accompanying him on his visit to China, accompanied by Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling, ascended the rostrum. At this moment, the audience rose and applauded like a storm, expressing respect to the distinguished guests.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi spoke at the enlarged joint meeting, extending a warm welcome to the state guest President Sukarno and the Indonesian friends. He said: We firmly believe that President Sukarno's visit to our country and his speech here today will provide a new impetus for the further development of friendship and mutual understanding between our two countries in the future.

    President Sukarno walked to the podium to speak, and the audience rose and applauded warmly.

    In his speech, the President described the various stages of the development of the Indonesian national independence movement. He said, we have gained independence, and we will never be willing to give up or sell any small part of our independence.

    President Sukarno said that the Indonesian people now want to realize the ideals that have been hidden in their hearts for decades or hundreds of years. Our ideal, in the political field, is to establish a unified, independent, and free Republic of Indonesia; in the social field, to establish an equal and prosperous society, which can also be said to be a socialist society. President Sukarno expressed his support for the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan. He said, your struggle for Taiwan is our struggle, and our struggle for West Irian is also your struggle. President Sukarno said that we do not participate in this group or that group, but we are not neutral, we will not stand idly by and allow war to happen, we will not stand by, and we will contribute our strength to the safety and peace of the world.

    The President finally said, let us move forward together, work together, and fight together. If all progressive humanity cooperates, world peace will surely be achieved, and a new world will surely arrive.

She said: "This is the magnificent voice of the independent Indonesian people. After listening to President Sukarno's speech, we have a further understanding of the aspirations of the Indonesian people." She also stated that the Chinese people sympathize with and fully support the struggle of the Indonesian people, and will do everything possible to maintain and strengthen the precious friendship with the Indonesian people.
