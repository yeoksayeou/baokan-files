Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps has achieved new development in agriculture, animal husbandry, and agricultural infrastructure construction this year. The agricultural production units have sown a total area of more than 1.59 million mu this year, an increase of 45% over last year. The unit area yield of major crops that have been harvested or are being harvested is more than 16% higher than last year. Of the thirty-six large and small water conservancy projects newly built and expanded by the water conservancy construction units this year, twelve have been completed or will be completed soon. The construction of new farms and land reclamation are being stepped up, and some new farms will be put into production this winter.

The average yield per mu of the 467,000+ mu of wheat already harvested by the Production and Construction Corps reached 205 jin, of which more than 19,900 mu averaged more than 440 jin per mu. According to recent preliminary estimates, the more than 350,000 mu of cotton being picked can yield an average of 300 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of about 25% over last year. Some units in the production corps that were relatively backward in production in the past have caught up with the advanced level this year. The Ili Reclamation Area, which had been relatively backward, harvested more than 30,000 mu of winter wheat this year, with an average yield of 270 jin per mu, overfulfilling the "1,000 mu, 1,000 dan" high-yield task assigned by higher authorities.

The average lambing rate of the 28 pastures here this year reached 94.5%. There are now a total of 725,000 livestock, an increase of more than 162,000 over last year.

At present, the agricultural production units have started autumn plowing and autumn sowing. It is planned to plow all the land to be sown next spring before this winter is over. 600,000 mu of winter wheat will be sown this winter, an increase of nearly one-fold over last year. Some farms have completed autumn sowing in mid-September. The animal husbandry units are now also building sheds and collecting large amounts of feed to ensure that livestock can safely overwinter. The Corps' surveying and design team has carried out basin planning in the Kaidu River basin and the Aksu River basin in southern Xinjiang, preparing to build large-scale water conservancy projects there and develop grassland wasteland on a large scale.

    新疆生产建设兵团的新成就
    播种面积比去年扩大45％
    新建扩建水利工程三十六项
    牲畜比去年增加十六万多头
    本报讯　新疆军区生产建设兵团今年在农、牧业生产和农业基本建设方面都获得新的发展。农业生产部队今年播种面积共一百五十九万多亩，比去年增加了45％。目前已经收获或正在收获的主要农作物的单位面积产量，都比去年提高16％以上。水利建设部队今年新建和扩建的三十六项大、小型水利工程已竣工和将竣工的有十二项。新农场建设和开荒造田工作正在加紧进行中，今冬将有部分新建农场投入生产。
    生产建设兵团已经收割的四十六万七千多亩小麦，平均亩产量达到二百零五斤，其中有一万九千九百多亩平均亩产四百四十多斤。正在收摘的三十五万多亩棉花，经最近初步测算，可以获得平均每亩三百斤皮棉的产量，比去年提高25％左右。生产部队中的有些过去生产比较落后的单位，已在今年赶上了先进的水平。过去一直比较落后的伊犁垦区，今年收割的三万多亩冬麦，获得了平均二百七十斤的亩产量，超额完成了上级交给的“千亩千石”的丰产任务。
    这里的二十八个牧场今年的绵羊繁殖率平均达到了94.5％，现有牲畜共七十二万五千多头，比去年增加了十六万两千多头。
    目前农业生产部队已开始了秋耕秋播工作。计划把明春播种的土地在今冬全部耕翻完毕。今冬播种的冬麦有六十万亩，比去年扩大将近一倍。部分农场已在9月中旬秋播完毕。畜牧部队现在也正在为牲畜安全越冬搭盖圈棚和收集大量饲料。这里的兵团勘测设计队已在南疆的开都河流域和阿克苏河流域进行流域规划，准备在那里兴建大型的水利工程，大规模开发草原荒地。
