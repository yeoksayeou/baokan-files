Speech by Comrade Song Naide, Vice Minister of Light Industry

I would like to offer some opinions on the issue of improving the quality of daily-use industrial products.

Currently, the output value of China's daily-use industrial products accounts for approximately 8.6% of the total national industrial output value and 28% of the total light industrial output value. These enterprises are basically managed by local authorities and are mostly newly formed joint state-private enterprises. The equipment is generally backward, with much manual operation, and there is a huge gap between advanced and backward facilities. However, because there are many small factories and a wide variety of products, it is easy to adapt to the various needs of the people. In some enterprises, the excellent techniques of China's long-standing handicraft industry are still preserved and developed.

In recent years, under the leadership of party and government at all levels and the efforts of the vast number of workers, the output of daily-use industrial products has increased, the quality has improved, and the variety has also expanded. Although some enterprises in the past one-sidedly emphasized increasing production and practicing economy, neglecting quality, which led to a decline in the quality of some products, efforts have been made since the fourth quarter of last year to largely stabilize it; after the Party Central Committee put forward the call to improve quality and increase variety this year, there has been further progress. According to the reports from fourteen provinces and cities in May this year, among ninety-nine products, the quality of thirty-one products has improved significantly compared with last year, fifty-three are basically stable or slightly improved, and fifteen are still inferior or declining; the quality of significantly improved products includes the bursting strength of Tianjin's No. 8 straw paperboard, which has increased from 2.7 kilograms last year to 6.4 kilograms; the products of the Jilin Enamel Factory have basically eliminated phenomena such as blistering, cracking, and porcelain chipping, and the physical indicators have reached the standards formulated by the Ministry of Light Industry, and the first-class product rate has also increased from 1% in September last year to 18.8% in the first quarter of this year; and the products of a few enterprises are close to international standards. However, the situation of poor quality still exists; China's famous porcelain has not yet returned to the best historical standards; some daily-use metal products are rough, and parts are not interchangeable; some thermos bottles have poor insulation capacity, and there are even explosions; some fountain pen barrels are deformed; some calculators do not produce accurate numbers; some slide rules pull out 3 × 3 = 9.1; some typewriters jam; "Fuqiang Brand" matches have loose boxes, thin sticks, small heads, and sand dropping, and have been called "Buqiang" (Not Strong) Brand, etc.

Based on the experience of various places, there are the following main issues in improving the quality of daily-use products.

   **Establish the concept of serving consumers**

I. Strengthening ideological leadership and establishing the concept of serving consumers. Some of our comrades tend to neglect improving product quality when emphasizing increasing production and practicing economy, emphasizing the completion of output value plans and financial plans; and when demanding improved product quality, they often overemphasize objective reasons such as poor equipment and unstable raw materials, lacking the spirit of actively improving on the basis of existing equipment. This year, the Changchun Leather Shoe Factory undertook to produce 2,000 pairs of export high-heeled shoes. The quality requirements were strict, and the enterprise's leadership attached great importance to it, conscientiously implementing the operating methods and various systems, and as a result, all products were first-class products; but after the task was completed, the market for leather shoes was brisk, everyone relaxed, and as a result, product quality declined. This shows that even under the existing production conditions, if we attach importance to producing excellent products for consumers and give play to the wisdom of the masses, we can improve product quality. Conversely, if we ideologically neglect quality issues, then even if the equipment is good and the raw materials are stable, quality degradation will occur.

In recent years, the measures of processing on order, unified purchase and guaranteed sales have achieved great gains, but also produced some problems, mainly isolating the direct connection between producers and the consumer market, making industrial departments less concerned about the quality and variety of their products than they were when they sold them themselves in the past. In this study of selecting and purchasing for self-sales, some factory directors reviewed and said: "In the past, production was responsible to the bureau and to the trade department, and there was no talk of being responsible to consumers at all." They also said: "It is not easy to explain if the output value is not completed. When going down to the workshop, we only ask about output. We feel that improving quality is not a matter of a day or two. When there are disputes between upstream and downstream sections due to quality problems, we would rather affect quality than affect output." This kind of thinking that is harmful to improving product quality has been criticized since the fourth quarter of last year, and enterprise leaders have also begun to clarify the view that production is to serve consumers, but this is only the beginning, and it is necessary to continue to conduct ideological education on product quality among all relevant staff and thoroughly eliminate the erroneous views of irresponsibility for quality. This is essential for further improving product quality.

    **Promote advanced technology and add equipment**

II. Another major reason, and also the fundamental reason, for the low quality of daily-use industrial products is the technical issue. Many factories lack reasonable product standards, operating procedures, inspection standards, and inspection methods, and often rely on experience to do things, lacking scientific basis. Although some systems have been established, they are not entirely reasonable. We have held professional meetings in several industries based on these situations, summarizing experience in production technology, and based on the different raw materials and equipment used by each factory, as well as the different sales targets of products, we have formulated unified product standards, inspection methods, and basic operating points, and gradually promoted them after pilot projects. Although this approach still has many shortcomings and errors that need to be overcome and corrected, the effect is generally good. For example, the smoothness of the nib of the gold nib manufactured in Shanghai has increased from three sides to four sides after the professional meeting of gold nibs, fountain pens and pencils, and half of them have reached five sides of smoothness in April this year; the qualified rate of ink sac water storage also reached 97.89% in April this year; iridium shedding has been reduced from 2% to basically eliminated; general pen tongues started to leak water at 11 to 14 degrees Celsius, and after the promotion of the Model 55 pen tongue, they can not leak water within 23 degrees, and the water storage capacity has also increased by more than one time.

In the process of summarizing and promoting advanced technology, some key equipment of certain enterprises must be resolved. For example, manufacturing high-grade drawing pencils requires a 150-ton press, but we only have a 20-ton press, and the pressed lead core is not strong enough. For another example, the plastic pen barrels of fountain pens are currently pressed vertically by manpower. If spiral presses are used instead, the production efficiency will be higher, and the quality of the pen barrels will be better. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to the technical transformation of daily-use industrial products. Often, when emphasizing ensuring key investment projects, we cut off small investments in adding some necessary equipment to existing enterprises. As a result, some enterprises lack the necessary control instruments and product and raw material inspection equipment in the production process. This has an impact on improving product quality. In the future, while emphasizing ensuring key projects, we must take care to add necessary equipment for improving quality, especially for newly established joint state-private enterprises, which urgently need to transform and add some key equipment and necessary instruments in order to stabilize and improve product quality.

    **Overcome the difficulties of raw material shortages**

III. Raw materials have a great relationship with product quality. Unqualified raw materials cannot guarantee a certain quality requirement for the product. For example, if the iridium particles of fountain pens contain many impurities, they will not be firmly welded and will not be wear-resistant; if the plastic of the pen barrel contains too much softener, it will be easily deformed. In daily-use industrial products, except for papermaking and leather, whose raw materials come from rural areas, most of the raw materials are reprocessed industrial raw materials. However, because these raw materials for daily-use products are used in small quantities and have strict specifications, the departments supplying raw materials tend to neglect them and are often squeezed out. Some raw materials can be completely produced domestically in terms of technology, such as stainless steel, iridium particles, and plastics for fountain pens, alloy sheets and steel wires for musical instruments, etc., which are still imported, and imported raw materials often do not meet production requirements. Therefore, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Forestry Industry, and the Ministry of Foreign Trade are required to take care of the needs of the daily-use industrial product industry and provide strong assistance in solving problems.

    **Implement professional leadership and systematically summarize experience**

IV. Strengthen leadership over light industry. Judging from the production technology of central enterprises and local enterprises in recent years, central enterprises generally progress faster, and local enterprises progress slower. An important piece of experience is that central departments are able to systematically summarize and accumulate experience more easily due to professional leadership; local departments manage everything in a package, making it difficult to delve into details. In the past year or so, various localities have noticed and strengthened leadership according to industry, which should be continued and implemented. The products of the daily-use industrial product industry are diverse. To lead so many industries well, it is necessary to grasp typical cases, systematically summarize experience, and gradually promote it in order to overcome generalization in leadership, narrow the gap between advanced and backward facilities, and adapt to enterprises with different equipment, so that the majority of enterprises in various industries can gradually reach advanced levels; without this, the advanced experience between various regions and industries cannot be concentrated, and the technical level cannot be quickly improved. In order to gradually bring the quality of light industrial products up to international standards, we should also actively collect some advanced foreign samples and equipment for research.

Of course, the work of improving the quality of daily-use products does not stop at the above aspects, but we feel that these are the main ones. Experience has also proved that wherever this is done, the quality of most products has improved; conversely, the quality of most products is still low or not very stable. We believe that with the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the support of the local party committees, as long as we work together with all the staff and workers of the light industry, we will definitely be able to improve the quality of our products. After two or three years of efforts, it is entirely possible to require the products of most enterprises in several major industries of the daily-use industrial product industry to reach the current domestic advanced level, and the products of some enterprises to reach the international level.

### 提高我国日用工业品的质量

    提高我国日用工业品的质量
    轻工业部副部长　宋乃德同志的发言
    我现在就提高日用品工业的质量问题发表一些意见。
    目前我国日用品工业的产值比重约占全国工业总产值的百分之八点六，占全部轻工业产值的百分之二十八。这些企业基本上是地方管理的，绝大部分是新公私合营企业，设备一般比较落后，多为手工操作，先进与落后相差悬殊。但因为是小厂多，品种多，故便于适应人民各种需要。在部分企业里还保留与发扬了我国历史悠久的手工业的卓越技术。
    这几年来，在各级党政的领导和广大职工的努力之下，日用品工业的产量提高了，质量有改进，品种也有增加。虽然过去有些企业由于片面强调增产节约，忽视质量，以致若干产品质量下降，但是从去年第四季度以来，经过努力，已经大部稳定下来；在今年党中央提出提高质量、增加品种的号召后，又有所进步。从今年五月间十四个省市所汇报的情况来看，在九十九种产品中，质量比去年显著提高的有三十一种，基本稳定或略有改进的五十三种，仍然低劣或下降的十五种；质量有显著改进的，如天津市的八号草板纸的突破力，由去年的二点七公斤上升到六点四公斤；吉林搪瓷厂产品已基本消灭了起泡、裂纹、掉瓷等现象，物理指标达到轻工业部拟定的标准，一等品率也由去年九月的百分之一提高到今年第一季度的百分之十八点八；并有少数企业的产品接近了国际水平。但是，质量低劣的情况仍然存在，我国著名的瓷器还未恢复到历史上最好的标准；有些日用金属制品粗糙，另件不能互换；有些保温瓶的保温能力不强，甚至还有爆炸现象；有些自来水笔笔杆变形；有的计算机摇出的数字不准确；有的计算尺拉出的3×3＝9.1；有的打字机卡字；“富强牌”火柴盒松、杆细、头小、掉砂，曾被称为“不强”牌等。
    综合各地经验，在改进日用品质量方面，有以下几个主要问题。树立为消费者服务的观点
    一、加强思想领导，树立为消费者服务的观点。我们有的同志，往往在强调增产节约、强调完成产值计划和财务计划的时候，容易忽视改进产品质量；而在要求提高产品质量的时候，又往往过分强调设备不好、原料不稳定等客观原因，缺乏在现有设备基础上积极改进的精神。今年长春皮鞋厂承制二千双出口高跟鞋，质量要求严格，企业的领导方面很重视，认真贯彻了操作法和各项制度，结果全部产品都是一级品；但在任务完成后，市场皮鞋畅销，大家松了劲，结果产品质量就下降。这说明，即使在现有的生产条件下，如果重视为消费者生产优良产品，发挥群众的智慧，是能改进产品质量的。反之，如果思想上忽视质量问题，那么即使设备好、原料稳定也会发生质量下降的现象。
    几年来，加工订货、统购包销的措施，取得了很大的收获，但是也产生了一些毛病，主要是隔离了生产者与消费市场的直接联系，使得工业部门不像过去自销时那样关心自己产品的质量品种问题。在这次研究选购自销时，有的厂长检讨说：“过去生产是对局负责，对贸易部门负责，根本谈不到对消费者负责。”又说：“产值完不成不好交待，下车间只问产量，觉得提高质量不是一天半天的事，遇到上下工段因质量问题发生争执时也是宁肯影响质量，也不要影响产量”。这种对提高产品质量有害的思想，去年第四季度以来，虽然已经受到批判，企业领导上也开始明确了生产是为消费者服务的观点，但这还只是开始，还必须继续在一切有关工作人员中进行关于产品质量的思想教育，彻底扫除对质量不负责任的错误观点。这对于进一步改进产品质量十分必要。推广先进技术，增添设备
    二、日用品工业产品质量不高的另一主要原因，也是基本的原因，就是技术问题。许多工厂缺乏合理的产品标准、操作规程、检验标准和检验方法，往往凭经验办事，缺乏科学根据。有些制度虽然建立了，但也不尽合理，我们曾经根据这些情况召开过若干行业的专业会议，总结生产技术方面的经验，并根据各厂所用原料和设备的不同，以及产品销售对象的不同，拟订统一的产品标准、检验方法、以及基本的操作要点，经过试点后，逐步推广。这样的做法，虽然还有不少缺点和错误需要克服纠正，但效果一般还好。如上海制造的金笔，在金笔、钢笔和铅笔的专业会议后，笔尖的光滑度已由三面达到四面，今年四月份已有一半达到五面光滑；笔胆的容水量合格率今年四月份也达到百分之九十七点八九；铱金脱落从百分之二作到基本消灭；一般笔舌在摄氏十一至十四度时，即开始漏水，推广了55式笔舌后，可以在二十三度内不漏水，而且容水量也提高了一倍多。
    在总结和推广先进技术中，某些企业的一些关键性设备必须加以解决。如制造高级绘图铅笔需要一百五十吨压力机，而我们只有二十吨的，压出的铅芯硬度不强。又如，自来水笔的塑胶笔杆目前是用直立式的人力压制，如改用螺旋式的压力机压制，生产效率既高，而且笔杆质量也好。我们过去对日用品工业的技术改造重视不够。常常在强调保证重点投资项目时，把对现有企业增添一些必要设备的小额投资削掉了。以致若干企业在生产过程中缺乏必要的控制仪表和产品、原料的检验设备。这对于改进产品质量是有影响的。今后必须在强调保证重点项目的同时，照顾增添改进质量的必要设备，尤其是新公私合营的企业，为了稳定和提高产品质量，更是迫切需要改造和增添一些关键性的设备和必要的仪器。克服原料不足的困难
    三、原料对产品质量的关系很大。原料不合格就不能保证产品一定的质量要求。如自来水笔铱粒含杂质多就焊接不牢、不耐磨；笔杆塑胶含软化剂多就容易变形。日用品工业中除造纸、皮革的原料来自农村外，绝大部分是工业原料再加工的。但是，这些日用品的原材料，由于用量小、规格要求严，供应原料的部门往往容易忽视，常被挤掉。有若干原料在技术上国内完全可以生产，如自来水笔用的不锈钢、铱粒、塑料，乐器上用的合金片、钢丝等等，现在仍是进口，而进口原料又常常不合生产的要求。因此，要求冶金工业部、化学工业部、森林工业部、对外贸易部照顾日用品工业的需要，大力协助解决。实行专业领导，系统总结经验
    四、加强对轻工业的领导。从几年来中央企业和地方企业的生产技术情况来看，中央企业一般地进步较快，地方企业进步较慢。其中重要的一条经验是中央部门由于专业领导容易系统地总结和积累经验；地方部门是一揽子管理，不易深入。最近一年多以来，各地已经注意到并且加强了按行业的领导，应该继续坚持和贯彻下去。日用品工业的产品多种多样，要将这样多的行业领导好，必须抓住典型、系统地总结经验，逐步推广，才能克服领导上的一般化，才能缩小先进与落后的距离，并且可以适应不同设备的企业，而使各行业的多数企业逐步达到先进水平；不如此，则各地区各行业之间的先进经验集中不起来，技术水平也不能很快提高。为了使轻工业产品质量逐渐达到国际水平，还应该积极搜集一些国外先进样品和设备，进行研究。
    提高日用品质量的工作当然不止上述几个方面，但我们觉得这些是主要的。经验也证明凡是这样做了的，大部分产品的质量有了提高；相反的，大部分产品的质量仍然较低或不很稳定。我们相信，有党中央的领导和各地党委的支持，只要我们同轻工业全体职工共同努力，一定能把产品的质量搞好。经过二、三年的努力，在日用品工业几个主要行业中，要求作到大多数企业的产品达到国内现有的先进水平，部分企业的产品达到国际水平，是完全可能的。
