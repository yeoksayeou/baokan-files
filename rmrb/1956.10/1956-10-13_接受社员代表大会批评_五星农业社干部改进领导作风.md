Xinhua News Agency, Nanyang, 11th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Qu Mingzhen reports: The resident cadres and management committee of the Five-Star Agricultural Cooperative in Changzhuang Township, Nanyang County, Henan Province, are accepting criticism from the Members' Representative Assembly and beginning to change their leadership style. Based on the suggestions of the Members' Representative Assembly and the conditions of the cooperative, they have decided to hold a Members' Representative Assembly once a month, allowing members to inspect and supervise the cooperative's leadership work. When assigning production tasks, they will only put forward general requirements and measures, and specific arrangements will be discussed and decided by each production team. In order to increase the income of cooperative members and solve their livelihood difficulties, it has also been decided to allow members four or five days a month to engage in household sideline production and arrange housework. This has greatly increased the labor enthusiasm of cooperative members, and a new atmosphere of unity and harmony has emerged throughout the cooperative.

The Members' Representative Assembly of this cooperative was recently held, and many member representatives criticized the subjectivism and commandism of the resident work team and cooperative cadres at the meeting.

The member representatives pointed out that during the farmland water conservancy campaign this spring, the resident cadres did not consult with the masses and blindly stipulated that "water conservancy" should be achieved in a very short period of time, "organizing" the vast majority of the cooperative's labor force to dig wells and level fields day and night. As a result, the timely sowing of spring crops was delayed. When the wheat was ripe, it should have been harvested, but the cadres, in order to catch up with the task, insisted on intercropping sweet potatoes and soybeans and accumulating fertilizer, pushing the wheat harvest back four days, causing 80% of the wheat to be reduced in yield due to rain. Later, in the rush to harvest and thresh wheat, the work team cadres again disregarded the actual conditions and insisted on completing the harvest and threshing task in three days and three nights, forcing cooperative members to thresh wheat in the rain, resulting in the spoilage of more than 320,000 jin of wheat.

The member representatives generally criticized that during the summer sowing this year, when promoting advanced experiences such as dense planting of corn, the resident cadres and management committee did not consider the specific conditions of the cooperative, such as soil quality and technology, and uniformly required about 7,000 seedlings per mu, an increase of nearly double from the past. As a result, because the land was relatively barren, lacking fertilizer, and the technology could not keep up, 378 mu of corn grew only stalks and did not produce ears.

At this meeting, the member representatives also raised sharp criticisms regarding the lack of concern of some cadres for the livelihood of cooperative members, restricting members from engaging in household sideline production, and not leaving members a certain amount of time to handle housework. They also provided more than 120 rational suggestions for improving leadership work.

The Chinese Communist Party branch and the cooperative management committee of this cooperative attached great importance to the opinions of the member representatives. In addition to adopting measures to improve work based on the criticisms and suggestions of the assembly, they also held meetings of party members and cadres to conduct criticism and self-criticism, and made self-criticisms to the member representatives and cooperative members, admitting their mistakes.

### 接受社员代表大会批评  五星农业社干部改进领导作风

    接受社员代表大会批评
    五星农业社干部改进领导作风
    新华社南阳11日电　新华社记者曲明振报道：河南省南阳县常庄乡五星农业社的驻社干部和社的管理委员会，接受社员代表大会的批评，开始改变领导作风。他们根据社员代表大会的建议和社里的条件，决定每月召开一次社员代表大会，让社员检查与监督社的领导工作；在布置生产任务时，只提出总的要求与措施，具体安排由各生产队自行讨论决定。为了增加社员收入和解决社员生活困难，还决定每月要给社员留出四、五天的时间，让社员经营家庭副业生产和安排家务。这样，大大提高了社员的劳动热情，全社出现了团结融洽的新气象。
    这个社的社员代表大会是最近召开的，许多社员代表在会上批评了驻社工作组和社干部的主观主义和强迫命令作风。
    社员代表们提出，今年春季在开展农田水利运动中，驻社干部没有和群众商量，盲目地规定要在很短的时间内实现“水利化”，“组织”全社绝大部分劳动力日夜打井和整畦，结果，耽误了春季作物的适时播种。麦子成熟的时候，本来应该收麦了，但是干部们为了赶任务，便硬叫社员实行红薯、黄豆间作，搞积肥，把收麦时间向后推迟了四天，使80％的麦子受到雨淋减产。后来，在小麦抢收、抢打工作中，工作组的干部又不看实际条件，硬要求三天三夜完成收打任务，强迫社员冒雨打麦，结果共蹧蹋小麦约三十二万多斤。
    社员代表们普遍批评说，今年夏播时，驻社干部和管理委员会在推行玉米密植等先进经验时，不根据社里的土质、技术等具体情况，每亩一律要求留苗七千株左右，一下子比过去增加近一倍，结果因为土地比较瘠薄、缺肥，技术跟不上，有三百七十八亩玉米，光长秆不结穗。
    在这次会上，社员代表们对部分干部不关心社员生活疾苦，限制社员开展家庭副业生产，不给社员留下一定时间处理家务等问题，也提出了尖锐的批评，并且还提供了一百二十多条有关改进领导工作的合理化建议。
    这个社的中共党支部和社管理委员会对社员代表的意见十分重视，除根据大会的批评和建议采取了改进工作的措施外，还召开党员、干部会议，进行批评与自我批评，并分别向社员代表、社员进行了检讨，承认了错误。
