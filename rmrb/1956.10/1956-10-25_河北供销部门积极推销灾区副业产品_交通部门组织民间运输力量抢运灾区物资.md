Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 22nd – Supply and marketing departments in Hebei Province have adopted a policy of attending to both large and small matters, opening up multiple avenues, practicing small profits and quick turnover, and mobilizing efforts at all levels, thereby opening up sales channels for side-line products from disaster areas.

The supply and marketing departments at all levels in Hebei Province have learned from the past, where they only focused on launching side-line production while neglecting to find sales channels, resulting in long-term stockpiling of products. This year, they have paid close attention to finding sales channels. The Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative dispatched fifteen key cadres to participate in five visiting groups organized by the Hebei Provincial People's Committee to Beijing, Tianjin, and the Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest regions to promote various products. Rao Yang, Zaoqiang, Ji County and four other disaster-stricken counties in Shijiazhuang Prefecture, while organizing disaster victims to develop side-line production, adopted the principle of "determining production based on sales" and signed 59 promotion contracts with other regions, totaling 648,800 yuan. The Ding County commercial department held an autumn materials exchange meeting in the county seat, where it signed 23 side-line sales contracts with relevant departments, totaling more than 17,000 yuan.

According to statistics from the six disaster-stricken prefectures of Baoding, Cangxian, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Xingtai, and Tongxian, more than 1.25 million disaster victims are now participating in side-line production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Hebei Provincial transportation departments are actively organizing civilian transportation forces to rush essential supplies such as grain, coal, and salt to disaster areas. In the six prefectures of Handan, Xingtai, Tianjin, Baoding, etc., 45,478 civilian rubber-wheeled carts, iron-wheeled carts, and handcarts, 2,373 mules and donkeys, and 2,482 small boats have already been organized to participate in transportation.

In the flood-stricken areas of Hebei Province, as the floodwaters gradually receded, the transportation task was extremely heavy, and the organized transportation capacity was far from meeting the needs of material transportation. To ensure that farmers in the affected villages have food, fuel, and other living supplies, transportation departments at all levels successively established transportation command posts in early October, and dispatched a large number of cadres to the countryside to organize disaster victims' vehicle transportation within agricultural cooperatives.

In the ten days from October 1st to 10th alone, the five prefectures of Baoding, Handan, Xingtai, Cangxian, and Shijiazhuang transported more than 65,530 tons of supplies to the disaster areas.

Both Baoding and Tianjin prefectures signed contracts with agricultural cooperatives when organizing civilian transportation tools.

    河北供销部门积极推销灾区副业产品
    交通部门组织民间运输力量抢运灾区物资
    新华社保定22日电　河北省供销部门采取大小兼顾，广开门路、薄利广销和上下齐动手的方针，打开了灾区副业产品销路。
    河北省各级供销部门，吸取了往年只注意发动开展副业生产，忽视找销路以致产品长期积压的教训，今年非常注意找寻销路。河北省供销社派了十五个主要干部，参加河北省人民委员会组织到北京、天津和东北、西北、西南五个访问组推销各种产品。石家庄专区饶阳、枣强、冀县等七个灾县，在组织灾民开展副业生产同时，就采取
  “以销定产”的原则和外地签订推销合同五十九份，总值六十四万八千多元。定县商业部门在县城举行了秋季物资交流会，会上和有关部门签订了二十三份副业销售合同，总值一万七千多元。
    据保定、沧县、天津、石家庄、邢台、通县六个受灾专区统计，现在参加副业生产的灾民有一百二十五万多人。
    据新华社讯　河北省交通运输部门正在积极组织民间运输力量，往灾区抢运粮食、煤炭、盐等生活必需品。在邯郸、邢台、天津、保定等六个专区，现在已经组织起参加运输的民间的胶轮大车、铁轮大车和人力手推车四万五千四百七十八辆，牲口骡子两千三百七十三头，小船两千四百八十二只。
    河北省水灾区在洪水逐渐消退后，由于运输任务十分繁重，已组织起来的运输力远远赶不上物资运输需要。为了保证受灾村庄农民有吃、有烧，以及其他生活物资供应，各级交通运输部门，在10月初陆续成立交通运输指挥部，并抽调大批干部下乡，深入农业社组织灾民车辆运输。
    仅在10月1日至10日的十天内，仅保定、邯郸、邢台、沧县、石家庄五个专区运往灾区的物资就有六万五千五百三十多吨。
    保定和天津专区在组织民间运输工具时，都和农业社订立合同。
