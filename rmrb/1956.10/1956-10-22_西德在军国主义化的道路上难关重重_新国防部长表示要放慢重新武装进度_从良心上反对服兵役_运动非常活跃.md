Xinhua News Agency, 21st, Bonn Dispatch: West Germany Faces Many Difficulties on the Road to Militarization.

New Defense Minister Says Re-Armament Progress Will Be Slowed.

"Conscientious Objection to Military Service" Movement Very Active.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch, Bonn: Newly appointed West German Defense Minister Strauss said on October 20th that West Germany would slow down the progress of its re-armament plan. He believes that the establishment of a new West German army should focus on "quality over quantity."

Strauss told reporters from the West German "Frankfurter Rundschau" that before the end of October, he would notify NATO that "the work of establishing armed forces cannot continue at the current excessive pace."

Strauss also stated that the number of tanks equipping the West German armed forces would be reduced from the original four thousand to two thousand seven hundred.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch, Bonn: The West German government's registration of young men of military age has recently encountered many difficulties. According to a Reuters report, officials from many local authorities have refused to carry out the registration work on the grounds of "conscientious objection to military service."

In Dortmund, in the Ruhr area, all fifteen officials responsible for registering young men of military age refused to work, so the registration of young men for military service in the city has come to a complete standstill. These officials stated that their conscience did not allow them to help with the work of conscripting soldiers.

The "Conscientious Objection to Military Service" movement is currently very active in West Germany. This movement has established offices in major West German cities. Many youth organizations, such as the Social Democratic youth organization, the "Eagle Group" and "Friends of Nature," as well as the YMCA, have expressed sympathy and support for this movement.

    西德在军国主义化的道路上难关重重
    新国防部长表示要放慢重新武装进度

    新华社21日讯　波恩消息：新上任的西德国防部长施特劳斯10月20日表示，西德将放慢它实行重新武装计划的进度。他认为，建立西德新军队应当“重质而不重量”。
    施特劳斯对西德“法兰克福论坛报”的记者说，在10月底以前，他要通知北大西洋公约组织，“不能按照目前的这种过分的进度继续进行建立武装部队的工作”。
    施特劳斯同时还表示，将要把装备西德武装部队的坦克数量从原定的四千辆减少到二千七百辆。
    新华社21日讯　波恩消息：西德政府登记兵役适龄青年的工作最近遭到了许多困难。据路透社消息，许多地方当局的官员们都以“从良心上反对服兵役”为理由而拒绝从事登记工作。
    在鲁尔区的多特蒙德，负责登记兵役适龄青年工作的全体官员十五人都拒绝工作，因此，这个城市的登记兵役青年的工作已经完全停顿了。这些官员表示，他们的良心不容许他们帮助进行征召兵员的工作。
    “从良心上反对服兵役”运动目前在西德非常活跃。这个运动在西德各大城市都设立了办事处。许多青年组织，如社会民主党的青年组织，“鹰团”和“自然之友”以及基督教青年会等，都表示同情和支援这个运动。
