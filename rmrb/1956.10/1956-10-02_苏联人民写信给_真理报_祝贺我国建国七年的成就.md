Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st Dispatch: According to TASS, many Soviet people wrote to "Pravda," sincerely congratulating the Chinese people on the seventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The newspaper published these letters on the 1st.

    Semyinski, a lathe operator from the "Red Excavator Factory" in Kiev, wrote in his letter, "The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is unbreakable and eternal. Those days became a real festival for us workers when our industrial products set off for the distant Chinese cities that we feel close to. Every time trains loaded with equipment are shipped out, we know that this is our modest contribution to the socialist construction of our brother country."
    Tursunkulev, Chairman of the Kaganovich Collective Farm in Uzbekistan, Deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and twice recipient of the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, wrote: "The Uzbeks often say: A friend's achievement is your achievement. We are proud of the victories achieved by the Chinese people. We are particularly concerned about the achievements of the Chinese farmers. We are proud of our friendship with the great Chinese people."
    Kostyukov, a foreman from the Kuznetsk Metallurgical Factory, and Bobyvanova, an engineer from Molotov City in the Urals, who had just returned from China, talked in their letters about their feelings of interacting and working with Chinese friends. They expressed their belief that the tasks put forward by the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China to the Chinese people will undoubtedly be completed.

    苏联人民写信给“真理报”
    祝贺我国建国七年的成就
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：许多苏联人写信给“真理报”，向中国人民衷心祝贺中华人民共和国成立七周年。这家报纸在1日发表了这些来信。　　　　基辅市“红色挖掘机工厂”的旋工谢明斯基在信中写道，“中苏人民的友谊是牢不可破的，是永恒的。在我们的工业产品启程运往遥远的、我们感到亲近的中国城市的时候，那些日子对我们工人来说成了真正的节日。每当运出一列车一列车的设备的时候，我们知道，这是我们对兄弟国家社会主义建设事业的微薄贡献。”
    乌兹别克卡冈诺维奇集体农庄主席、苏联最高苏维埃代表、社会主义劳动英雄称号两次获得者图尔松库列夫写道：“乌兹别克人常说：朋友的成就就是你的成就。我们以中国人民所取得的胜利而自豪。我们特别关心中国农民的成就。我们为自己同伟大的中国人民的友谊而自豪”。
    才从中国回国的库兹涅茨克冶金工厂工长科斯丘科夫和乌拉尔莫洛托夫城的工程师波比瓦诺娃在他们的信中谈到了同中国朋友相处和共事的感想。他们表示相信，中国共产党第八次全国代表大会向中国人民提出的任务无疑地将会完成。
