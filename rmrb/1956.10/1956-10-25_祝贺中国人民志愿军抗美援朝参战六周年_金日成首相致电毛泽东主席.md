Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 24th -- Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, today sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong, congratulating the sixth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

The telegram said: On the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, I, on behalf of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean people, extend my heartfelt gratitude and respect to you and, through you, to the Chinese people.

The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army, achieved victory in the Fatherland Liberation War of the Korean people against the aggressors, and in the post-war period, they have firmly guarded the line of peace and actively helped the Korean people's post-war reconstruction.

I am confident that the traditional friendly relations between the people of Korea and China will be further consolidated and developed in the common struggle for the prosperity and development of our two countries and for world peace.

I sincerely wish the great Chinese people even more brilliant achievements in the cause of socialism, peace, and friendship among the peoples of all countries.
