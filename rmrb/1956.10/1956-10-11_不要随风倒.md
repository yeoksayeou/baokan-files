The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, together with several major industrial trade unions, recently inspected the work of subsidizing workers with financial difficulties. They found that after emphasizing concern for workers' lives and opposing bureaucratic indifference to the hardships of the masses, many cadres were afraid of being labeled as bureaucratic and developed a compromising attitude. Some cadres clearly knew that some workers did not have financial difficulties, had savings in the bank, and even deposited the subsidies they had received in the past to earn interest, but they continued to provide them with subsidies. Many enterprises had exhausted their accumulated labor welfare funds or enterprise bonus funds in the first half of the year, or even in the first quarter, and were clamoring for subsidies from higher-level trade unions.

This is a thought-provoking matter. Our Party Central Committee has always emphasized carrying out struggles on two fronts in its instructions for various tasks, opposing both "leftist" deviations and preventing rightist deviations. Areas, departments, and units that have conscientiously and earnestly implemented the correct instructions of the Central Committee are making smooth progress in their work; however, some units inevitably experience deviations in their work. During the anti-waste campaign last year, didn't some units spread out engineering plans and recklessly cut them without regard for economic effects? During the anti-conservatism campaign this spring, didn't some units recklessly increase tasks without considering possibilities or conditions? In the previous period, when the Central Committee proposed opposing both right-leaning conservatism and impetuous advance, didn't some units recklessly reduce production tasks?

Why does this phenomenon occur? The most important reason is that the leaders of these units suffer from a significant subjective and one-sided problem in their thinking. They lack the spirit of seeking truth from facts. They do not start their work with investigation and research, nor do they proceed from specific circumstances. They do not look downward, go among the masses, go into practice, and study the specific contradictions in the work of their units; instead, they act based on feelings and "follow the wind." This is a reflection of the subjectivist style of thinking that the Eighth National Congress of the Party emphatically opposed in economic work.

However, people who have made deviations in their work often find some basis in certain superior documents to justify their own mistakes. Therefore, there are two issues that must be clarified here.

First, is it to conscientiously study the instructions of the higher authorities, grasp their essence, and then implement them in practical work? Or is it to grasp a superficial understanding, a few words, and then "implement" them? Obviously, we need the former approach, not the latter. Grasping a superficial understanding, a few words, and then making a big fuss about it will only distort the instructions of the higher authorities. Those who like to act according to the wind are precisely doing this. They appear to be the most active implementers of the instructions of the higher authorities, but in reality, they often distort the instructions of the higher authorities. For example, the Party Central Committee and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have always advocated "taking into account both" production and living in dealing with production and living issues, and have always advocated improving the lives of workers on the basis of developing production. In June of this year, the Central Committee approved and forwarded a report from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on the material lives of workers, advocating going deep among the masses, investigating the living difficulties of workers, and solving problems that are possible and must be solved. The instructions clearly stated that what should be solved are the problems that are "possible and must be solved," and specifically pointed out that for the living problems of workers, "specific analysis and overall planning should be carried out on the basis of investigation and research"; however, the example of Shanghai shows that some units do not distinguish between urgency and possibility, and want to complete good deeds in "one morning." This proves that if you do not conscientiously study the instructions of the higher authorities, but only grasp a superficial understanding, a few words, and then stir up a wind, deviations will inevitably occur in the work.

Second, is it to investigate and research, combine with specific circumstances, and implement the instructions of the higher authorities in a realistic manner? Or is it to be ignorant, detached from reality, and mechanically "implement" the instructions of the higher authorities? Obviously, we need the former approach, not the latter. Detachment from reality and mechanical application make it impossible to truly implement the instructions of the higher authorities. Those who like to act according to the wind often do not understand the specific situation and blindly implement the instructions of the higher authorities, and as a result, they always fail to implement them. Chongqing City once had two different approaches to solving the problem of worker housing. Initially, some units did not conduct serious investigation and research, and proposed a huge plan for new worker housing. According to statistics from only 112 units, the urgently needed new housing area was 700,000 square meters; even if the Chongqing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau invested all its construction force, it would take a year to complete, and there were still many difficulties in terms of materials. Relying on this huge but impossible plan obviously could not solve the housing difficulties of workers and could not implement the instructions to care for the lives of workers. Later, the responsible persons of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee went deep into the grassroots level, investigated and researched, helped some units check the original plans, made specific analyses of the housing difficulties of workers, and found that the situations were different and the requirements varied. Some needed repairs to their houses, some needed expansion or reconstruction of their houses, and some were willing to build their own houses with public assistance; only a small number of workers had to rely on new housing built by the state to solve their difficulties. After such a specific analysis, only less than one-third of the more than 3,000 households of workers in the No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant who originally claimed to be in urgent need of housing actually needed new housing to solve their difficulties. After conducting such investigation and research and adopting different measures for different situations, the housing difficulties of most workers in some units have been preliminarily resolved in a timely manner, and the instructions to care for the lives of workers have been implemented very effectively.

Some people say: "It is inevitable to have some deviations when big storms and waves arise." This also makes some sense. Anyone can make mistakes, and any work can have deviations. However, the important question is what attitude we take towards these deviations? Is it to correct them in time? Or is it to let them run their course? Or even stir up trouble? Obviously, the correct attitude should be to correct them in time, not to let them run their course, let alone stir up trouble. Those who like to act according to the wind often do not understand this principle. They confuse the objective "inevitability of deviations" with the subjective tolerance and indulgence of deviations. This is a problem of ideological method and a problem of work style. If we do not solve this problem, how can our leadership level be improved? How can our work be done well?

Our economic work, like any work, requires vigorous and creative labor. Only by linking with reality and seeking truth from facts can we stimulate the creative enthusiasm of the masses and effectively implement the correct policies of the Party, thereby constantly innovating our work. If we disregard the actual situation and make the masses exhaust themselves in constant vacillation, we will stifle the creative enthusiasm of the masses and weaken the most valuable force on which our economic cause depends for development.

It is hoped that the leaders of all economic units will put away the "follow the wind" style of work and let the style of seeking truth from facts in our economic work be carried forward, so as to better implement the correct policies of the Party Central Committee, improve our work, and advance the socialist cause of our country.

    不要随风倒
    上海市工会联合会同几个主要产业工会，最近检查了工会对生活有困难的职工的补助工作，发现在强调关心职工生活、反对漠视群众疾苦的官僚主义之后，许多干部怕戴官僚主义的帽子，产生迁就情绪。有些干部明明知道有的职工生活并不困难，银行里有存款，甚至过去领到的补助金也是存到银行里去生利息的，还继续给他们补助。很多企业在上半年，甚至在第一季度，就把历年来积余的劳动福利金或企业奖励金用得一干二净，纷纷要求上级工会补助。
    这是一件引人深思的事情。我们党中央从来对于各种工作的指示，都强调进行两条战线的斗争，既要反对“左”的偏向，又要防止右的偏向。凡是切实认真贯彻中央正确指示的地区、部门和单位，工作都在顺利前进；但是，也有一些单位在工作中却不免发生偏差。去年反浪费，不是有些单位摊开工程计划，不管经济效果，就一个劲往下削吗？今春反保守，不是也有些单位不计可能，不顾条件，一个劲往上加任务吗？前一个时期，中央提出在反对右倾保守的同时也要反对急躁冒进，不是又有些单位把生产任务一个劲往下减吗？
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？最主要的，是这些单位的领导人思想上患了很大的主观片面的毛病。他们缺乏实事求是的精神。他们做工作，不从调查研究着手，不从具体情况出发。他们不是眼睛朝下，到群众中去，到实际中去，研究本单位工作中的具体矛盾；而是凭着感想办事，“随风倒”。这正是党的第八次全国代表大会所着重反对的主观主义的思想作风在经济工作中的一种反映。
    然而，在工作中发生了偏差的人常常会找到某些上级文件中的一点根据，为他们自己的错误辩解。因此，这里有两个问题必须弄清楚。
    第一，是认真研究上级的指示，领会其精神实质，然后贯彻到实际工作中去呢？还是抓得一鳞半爪、三言两语，就往下“贯彻”？显然，我们需要的是前一种做法，而不是后一种做法。抓得一鳞半爪、三言两语，就大做起文章来，只能使上级的指示走样。那些喜欢看风行事的人，恰恰是这样做的。他们看来像是上级指示的最积极的执行者，实际上却常常把上级的指示歪曲了。例如，党中央和全国总工会在对待生产和生活问题上从来都主张“兼顾”，从来都主张在发展生产的基础上改善职工生活。今年6月，中央批转全国总工会一份关于职工物质生活的报告，提倡深入群众，调查职工生活困难情况，解决可能而又必须解决的问题。指示里分明写着要解决的是“可能而又必须解决”的问题，并且具体指出对于职工生活问题应该在调查研究的基础上，具体分析，全面规划”；可是，上海的例子却说明，有些单位竟不分缓急，不计可能，想在“一个早上”把好事办完。这就证明，如果不认真研究上级的指示，只抓住一鳞半爪、三言两语，就括起风来，那是一定会使工作发生偏差的。
    第二，是调查研究，结合具体情况，实事求是地执行上级的指示呢？还是心中无数，脱离实际，生搬硬套地“贯彻”上级的指示呢？显然，我们需要的是前一种做法，而不是后一种做法。脱离实际，生搬硬套，是不可能真正把上级的指示贯彻下去的。那些喜欢看风行事的人，常常不了解具体情况，就把上级的指示盲目地往下贯彻，结果总是贯彻不下去。重庆市在解决职工住宅问题上，就曾经有过两种不同的做法。最初，有些单位没有认真调查研究，就提出庞大的新建职工住宅的计划，仅据一百一十二个单位的统计，提出急待新建的住宅面积就有七十万平方公尺；即使重庆市建筑工程局投入全部施工力量，也要一年才能建成，况且材料等方面还有许多困难。依靠这个庞大的、然而是不可能实现的计划，显然并不能解决职工的住宅困难，并不能贯彻关心职工生活的指示。后来，中共重庆市委员会和重庆市人民委员会的责负人，深入下层，调查研究，帮助一些单位检查了原来的计划，对职工的住宅困难做了具体分析，发现情况不一，要求各异。有的是房屋需要修补，有的是房屋需要扩建、改建，有的是愿意自建公助；只有一部分职工必须依靠国家新建住宅才能解决困难。经过这样具体分析，仅第一钢铁厂原来提出急需房屋的三千多户职工中，真正需要新建住宅来解决困难的，不足三分之一。做了这样的调查研究，对不同的情况，采取不同的措施，有些单位大部分职工的住宅困难，已经及时得到初步解决，关心职工生活的指示很有成效地贯彻下去了。
    有人说：“大风大浪起来，出些偏差难免”。这也有一定的道理。任何人都可能犯错误，任何工作也都可能发生偏差。但是，重要的问题是我们对待这些偏差采取什么态度？是及时纠正呢？还是听其自流？甚至兴波助浪呢？显然，正确的态度应该是及时纠正，而不是听其自流，更不是兴波助浪。那些喜欢看风行事的人，常常不了解这个道理，他们把客观上的“偏差难免”同主观上对偏差的容忍和放任混淆起来。这是思想方法问题，也是工作作风问题。如果不解决这个问题，我们的领导水平怎么能提高呢？我们的工作怎么能做好呢？
    我们的经济工作，同任何工作一样，需要生气勃勃的创造性的劳动。而只有联系实际，实事求是，才能激发群众创造的热情，才能有效地贯彻党的正确方针，从而不断地革新我们的工作。如果我们不顾实际情况，支使群众在不断的摇摆不定中疲于奔命，就会窒息群众的创造热情，削弱了我们的经济事业赖以发展的最宝贵的力量。
    希望一切经济单位的领导人收拾起“随风倒”的作风，让我们经济工作中的实事求是的作风发扬光大起来，以便更好地贯彻党中央的正确方针，改进我们的工作，推进我国社会主义的事业。
