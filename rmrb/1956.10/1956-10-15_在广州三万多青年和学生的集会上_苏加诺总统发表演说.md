Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 14th. Indonesian President Sukarno told over 30,000 youth and students gathered inside and outside the Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall today, "I say to the people of Asia and Africa, I say to the people of the world, do not allow China's independence to be violated. Because China's independence is the independence of the Asian people, which is the independence of all mankind."

The youth and students of Guangzhou City had been anticipating President Sukarno's visit as if they were waiting for their own relatives to return. They meticulously made many colorful flags, banners, and paper flowers, and many children prepared gifts to give to their beloved Uncle Sukarno. Today, as President Sukarno's car just stopped next to the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, a group of children from the First Grade of the No. 27 Middle School immediately surrounded him. A girl named Li Yanfen quickly took off her red scarf and put it around President Sukarno's neck, and tightly grasped the President's hand, saying repeatedly, "Hello, Uncle Sukarno! Hello, Uncle Sukarno!" A boy named Ni Gongtao gave President Sukarno a diary, with a letter inside, asking Uncle Sukarno to take it back and give it to the children of Indonesia.

During his speech to the welcoming youth and students, which lasted one hour and forty-five minutes, President Sukarno was repeatedly interrupted by cheers of "Long live President Sukarno!" "Bung Karno!" "Merdeka!" and prolonged applause.

President Sukarno conveyed the greetings and best wishes of the Indonesian youth to the young men and women.

President Sukarno said that the Chinese and Indonesian people share the same political ideals, which is to eliminate imperialism and colonialism from their own lands. Both nations have the confidence to win, because 1.6 billion people of Asia and Africa stand on the same front in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism, plus the 2 billion progressive people of the world, this torrent will completely engulf imperialism and colonialism.

President Sukarno continued, saying that the social ideals of China and Indonesia are consistent in their foundations and principles, both aiming to build a fair and prosperous society without capitalism. He emphasized that true fairness cannot be separated from economic prosperity. He said that China and Indonesia have sufficient material strength to carry out their own national economic construction. President Sukarno pointed out that the friendship between China and Indonesia has made it possible for us to help each other.

President Sukarno talked about the importance of national unity, saying that China and Indonesia had almost suffered subjugation in the past because of internal disunity, and later gained independence and freedom because of national unity.

He said that imperialist colonialists use two kinds of weapons, spiritual and material. The former is invisible, but it is constantly injected into people's hearts and minds to destroy their personalities, create division, and make nations disunited, hating and killing each other.

President Sukarno continued, saying that now is the dying period of colonialism and imperialism, and because they are dying, they are even more frantic. They have adopted new weapons, replacing the past practice of creating chaos within nations with inciting relations between one nation and another. Their new slogan is: "Asians fight Asians." After the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung last year, the Asian-African people united to oppose imperialism and colonialism, which is completely correct.

President Sukarno said: Let us not be instigated by imperialism anymore in the future. Let the 1.6 billion people of Asia and Africa unite and use concerted action to completely eliminate imperialism's conspiracy of "Asians fighting Asians."

President Sukarno said, I say to the whole world and the people of Asia and Africa, do not allow the independence of the People's Republic of China to be violated, its independence is the independence of all Asians and Africans, of all mankind.

Guangzhou Mayor Zhu Guang also spoke before President Sukarno's speech.

As this welcoming meeting was about to end, President Sukarno accepted a batch of Guangdong local products and special handicrafts presented to him by Guangdong Governor Tao Zhu, including the famous ivory carvings, Chaozhou embroidery and dried lychees. As President Sukarno and Governor Tao Zhu shook hands tightly, tens of thousands of youth and students shouted: "Long live the friendship between China and Indonesia!"

    在广州三万多青年和学生的集会上
    苏加诺总统发表演说
    据新华社广州14日电　印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺今天上午对集聚广州中山纪念堂内外欢迎他的三万多青年和学生说，我对亚非人民讲，我对全世界人民讲，不要让中国的独立受到侵犯。因为中国的独立，也就是亚洲人民的独立，也就是全世界人类的独立。
    广州市的青年们和学生们，早就像等待自己的亲人回来一样，期待着苏加诺总统前来访问。他们精心制作了许多彩旗、标语和纸花，还有许多孩子准备了礼物要送给亲爱的苏加诺伯伯。今天，当苏加诺总统乘坐的汽车刚刚在中山纪念堂旁边停下的时候，站在附近的市二十七中学初一班的一群孩子立刻就围过来了。一个名叫李燕芬的女孩子迅速取下自己的红领巾围到苏加诺总统的颈上，并紧紧地握着总统的手频频说：“加诺伯伯好！加诺伯伯好！”还有一个叫倪公陶的男孩子，交给苏加诺总统一个日记本，并在里边夹上一封信，请求加诺伯伯代他带回去转给印度尼西亚的小朋友们。
    苏加诺总统在对欢迎他的青年和学生的一小时又四十五分钟的讲话当中，一再被“苏加诺总统万岁！”“朋加诺！”“默地加！”的欢呼声和长时间的鼓掌声所打断。
    苏加诺总统向男女青年们转达印度尼西亚青年的问候和致意。
    苏加诺总统说，中国和印度尼西亚人民在政治理想方面，同是要求从自己的国土上消灭帝国主义、殖民主义。两个民族都有必胜的信心，因为亚非十六亿人民在反对帝国主义和殖民主义斗争中站在一条阵线，加上全世界进步人类共有二十亿，这条洪流将把帝国主义和殖民主义彻底吞没。
    苏加诺总统接着说，中国和印度尼西亚社会方面的理想在基础和原则上是一致的，都是要建立一个公平繁荣没有资本主义的社会。他强调指出真正的公平不能离开经济上的繁荣。他说，中国和印度尼西亚两国拥有充分的物质力量，足以进行自己国家的经济建设。苏加诺总统指出，中国和印度尼西亚两国友好已为我们相互进行帮助提供了可能。
    苏加诺总统谈到民族团结的重要，他说，中国和印度尼西亚过去曾经因为民族内部不团结而几乎遭受沦亡，后来由于民族团结而获得独立自由。
    他说，帝国主义殖民主义使用两种武器，精神的和物质的，前一种是看不见的，但他经常地被注射到人们的心灵、脑子里来毁灭他们的人格，进行分化，使各民族不团结，互相仇恨、残杀。
    苏加诺总统接着说，现在是殖民主义帝国主义处于垂死时期，因为垂死，所以更加疯狂，他们采用了新的武器，用挑拨这一民族与那一民族的关系来代替过去在民族内部制造混乱的作法，他们的新口号是：“亚洲人打亚洲人”。去年在万隆召开的亚非会议后，亚非人民团结起来反对帝国主义、殖民主义，完全正确。
    苏加诺总统说：让我们今后不要再为帝国主义所挑拨了，亚非十六亿人民团结起来，用一致的行动，彻底消灭帝国主义的“亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋。
    苏加诺总统说，我对全世界和亚非人民讲，不要让中华人民共和国的独立受到侵犯，他的独立是全亚非人，全体人类的。
    广州市市长朱光在苏加诺总统讲话之前也讲了话。
    苏加诺总统在这个欢迎会将要结束的时候，接受了广东省省长陶铸送给他的一批广东土特产品和特种工艺品，其中有著名的象牙雕刻品，潮汕抽纱和荔枝干。当苏加诺总统和陶铸省长紧紧握手的时候，几万个青年和学生高呼：“中国和印度尼西亚的友好万岁！”
