    Observe Public Order in the Stadium
  　Zhao Ji
   On the afternoon of the 11th, during the football selection match between the United Team Red Team of China's Olympic Games team and the Shanghai team, the order in the stadium was so bad that it eventually affected the continuation of the match.
    The match had already started, and the stands were full. Batch after batch of spectators continued to enter the Xianongtan Stadium to watch the game from below the stands. Some people sat close to the sidelines of the field, making them susceptible to accidental injury; others stood together, blocking the view of the spectators in the stands. This wasn't all; in the last three minutes before the end of the match, a portion of the audience surged into the football field, causing great chaos and making it impossible for the game to continue.
    The preparatory committee of the selection match bears the main responsibility for this chaotic situation. Of course, in order to allow more people to see the exciting matches, it is permissible to allow a portion of organized spectators to enter the area under the stands to watch, when necessary and possible. However, if this is to be done, preparations must be made, such as designating viewing locations in advance, establishing close contact with the leaders of these spectators, and assigning special personnel to guide them into the venue in an orderly manner. However, the preparatory committee of yesterday's selection match did not do this; people were allowed to enter without any prior planning, and no effective measures were taken to restore order after the chaos occurred.
    The kind of thing that happened yesterday is not an isolated case. Not long ago, when the Romanian basketball team visiting our country was playing an exhibition match in Harbin, the game was delayed for nearly two hours because spectators flooded the court. We hope that the units organizing exciting games in the future will learn from these lessons and do a better job of organizing.
    Of course, the part of the audience who rushed into the field and affected the game's progress cannot escape criticism. Their enthusiasm for watching the game and their desire to see clearly are completely understandable. But in any case, they should not therefore fail to listen to the advice of the staff and forget that it is the duty of every citizen to observe public order.

### 遵守球场的公共秩序

    遵守球场的公共秩序
  　赵基
   11日下午，中国参加奥林匹克运动队足球选拔赛联队红队对上海队比赛的时候，场内秩序太坏，最后竟至影响了比赛的继续进行。
    比赛已经开始了，看台上早已座满，又有一批又一批的观众，陆续地进到先农坛体育场里的看台下面看球。有些人坐在了紧靠球场边线的地方，很容易被误伤；有些人则挤在一起站着看，遮住了看台上观众的视线。这还不算，在临终场前三分钟，有一部分观众竟蜂拥到足球场里边，一时场内秩序大乱，球赛无法继续。
    造成这种混乱情况，选拔赛的筹备委员会是要负主要责任的。当然，为了使更多的人看到精采的比赛，在必要和可能的时候，允许一部分有组织的观众进到场内的看台下观看，这是可以的。但是，既然要这样做，就要做好准备工作，比如，事先划定观看地点，同这些观众的领队者取得密切联系，并指派专人引导他们列队有秩序地入场等等。可是，昨天选拔赛的筹备委员会并没有这样做，事前是无计划地放人入场，发生混乱现象后又未采取有效措施恢复秩序。
    像昨天发生的这类事情并不是个别的。不久以前，来我国访问的罗马尼亚篮球队在哈尔滨作访问比赛的时候，也曾因为观众拥进了球场，使比赛延迟了近两个小时才开始。我们希望以后组织精采球赛的单位接受教训，把组织工作做得更好一些。
    当然，拥入球场内影响比赛进行的那一部分观众，也不能不受到指责。他们热情地去看比赛，并且希望能够看得清楚一些，这种心情是完全可以理解的。但是无论如何不应该因此就不倾听场内工作人员的劝导，忘记了遵守公共秩序是每一个公民的义务。
