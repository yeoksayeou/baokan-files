Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 5th: A newly built 70-kilometer highway from Baise to Lingle in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture officially opened to traffic on National Day. This year, Guangxi Province has built eight new main highway lines in minority areas, totaling 456 kilometers. Currently, 315 kilometers of roadbed have been completed. It is expected that all eight main highway lines can be completed and open to traffic this year.

Most of these newly built highways are located in remote mountainous areas inhabited by ethnic minorities.

In the past, transportation was very inconvenient in the Yao Autonomous County of Dayao Mountain and the Miao Autonomous County of Damiao Mountain. Even pedestrians had difficulty traversing the rugged serpentine trails. Now, the construction of the two newly built main highway lines in these two counties has been mostly completed and will soon be open to traffic.

    桂西八条公路大部筑成
    新华社南宁5日电　桂西僮族自治州百色到凌乐间新建的一条七十公里长的公路，已经在国庆节正式通车，今年广西省少数民族地区新建的公路干线有八条，共长四百五十六公里，目前已经有三百一十五公里筑成路基，预计在今年内，这八条公路干线可以全部完工通车。
    这些新建公路大部分是在少数民族聚居的边远山区。
    大瑶山瑶族自治县和大苗山苗族自治县过去交通很不方便，崎岖的蛇形小道，行人都不容易通过。现在这两个县第一次新建的两条公路干线，筑路工程已完成大半，不久就可以通车。
