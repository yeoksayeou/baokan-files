Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 26th: According to the Polish News Agency, Warsaw: The following is a summary of Władysław Gomułka's speech at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party on October 20:

	It has been eight years since the August plenary session where the Party's policy underwent a sudden change. However, these years are a historical period that has already ended. I firmly believe that this period will never return.

	Many bad things happened during these years. What that period left to the Party, the working class, and the people of the whole country is, in some aspects of life, more than just shocking.

	Two and a half months ago, the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee assessed both the positive and negative aspects of this past period and formulated guiding principles for future action. Although I hoped to attend that meeting, I was unable to do so.

	I have certain reservations about the resolutions of the Seventh Plenary Session. These reservations concern the assessment of the past and the Party's agricultural policy.

	Apart from this, I believe that these resolutions are correct and treat them as a correct course of action. In the process of implementing them, they will need stricter interpretation and supplementation. Some important current issues are not mentioned in these resolutions. Some of these issues can be resolved today because they have matured. Other issues must wait until they have matured in our minds and the appropriate conditions are in place before they can be resolved.

	My reservations about the resolutions of the Seventh Plenary Session, in terms of the assessment of the past, involve economic and political issues. These reservations relate both to the right and wrong of this assessment and to the responsibility of those who caused errors and deviations—the responsibility arising from this assessment.

	The resolutions of the Seventh Plenary Session talked about the achievements and mistakes made in the implementation of the Six-Year Plan.

	The resolution cited the extensive development of our country's industrial, especially heavy industrial, production capacity during this period, considering it the most important result of the Six-Year Plan, surpassing all others.

	I do not in any way deny any of the achievements our country has made. We all, like the people of the whole country, are pleased with the increase in our country's industrial production. I have no reason to doubt the published indices of industrial production growth. I believe these indices and consider them to be true. However, there are certain "buts" that force me to re-evaluate this assessment of our country's economic achievements during the past Six-Year Plan period.

	Let us look at the achievements of the Six-Year Plan in coal mining. In 1949, the last year of the Three-Year Plan, coal production was over 74 million tons. In 1955, the last year of the Six-Year Plan, coal production was 94.5 million tons. These figures show that coal production increased by more than 20 million tons, which could truly be considered a great achievement if this increase was due to the improvement of the coal mining industry's production capacity.

	However, statistics show that miners worked overtime for 92,634,000 hours in 1955, which is equivalent to 15.5% of the total working hours at that time, equivalent to 14.6 million tons of coal extracted outside of normal working hours. As for the situation of labor productivity in the coal mining industry, in 1949, the amount of coal mined per worker per working day was equal to 1,328 kilograms. In 1955, it fell to 1,163 kilograms, which is a decrease of 12.4%. The output of underground coal miners decreased by 7.7% per working day. Compared to 1938, the output per coal miner per working day in 1955 decreased by 36%.

	The characteristic of the economic policy for the coal mining industry was unforgivable inconsideration. At that time, the Sunday work system was adopted, which could only harm the miners' health and physical strength, while making it difficult to keep the coal mining equipment in a state that could perform normal work. At that time, the practice of using soldiers and prisoners to work was also adopted in some coal mines. The coal mining staff had never been stable, and the number of people replaced each year accounted for a large percentage. This policy could only harm the coal mining plan and only create the current situation of the coal mine.

	The purpose of the Six-Year Plan was to raise the living standards of the working class and the people of the whole country. However, after the end of the Six-Year Plan, in the first year of the Five-Year Plan, we faced growing and enormous economic difficulties.

	In order to expand industry, we concluded large investment loan contracts, and when we needed to repay the first batch of loans that were due, we found ourselves in a bankrupt situation where we were unable to repay. We had to ask the lenders to agree to postpone the repayment. At the same time, a considerable part of these loans, which took the form of machinery and equipment, could not be used for production until now, and for a long time to come, and a part of them must be considered an irretrievable loss.

	Although we can postpone the repayment and postpone half of the payments due during the current Five-Year Plan to the next Five-Year Plan, there is still a considerable deficit in the balance of payments of the Five-Year Plan. In this case, the reality of the already established Five-Year Plan is greatly affected.

	We know that, compared to the amount of currency, there is a danger of a lack of sufficient goods in the domestic market.

	Did the resolutions of the Seventh Plenary Session talk about all of this? They did not. Of course, the fact that the resolutions made a relatively mild assessment of the past is not the most important thing. What is important is that in order to correctly formulate future plans, an accurate analysis of the economic situation is essential. These listed facts must not be lightly dismissed.

	In the agricultural aspect of the national economy (the interpretation given to it by the Seventh Plenary Session caused some reservations in my mind), starting in 1949, that is, in the past six years, the Party launched a movement to collectivize agricultural production. During this period, approximately 10,000 agricultural cooperatives were established, with approximately 6% of farm households participating.

	In our country's situation, as in the situation of every country that does not have excess land available for use, the characteristic of rural policy should be a continuous effort to intensify agricultural production. To enable Poland to feed its people with its own resources, it is only possible to increase yield per unit area and increase agricultural output per hectare of land.

	Let us look at the value of the total product of each hectare of land in various sectors of our agricultural economy (i.e., individual economy, agricultural cooperatives, and state-owned farms). In 1955, 78.8% of farmland was in the hands of individual farmers, cooperatives accounted for 8.6%, and state-owned farms accounted for 12.6%. If the total output produced by these farms is taken as 100, the distribution of the total output is as follows: individual farmers accounted for 83.9%, agricultural cooperatives 7.7%, and state-owned farms 8.4%.

	If we estimate the value of the total product per hectare of arable land, we will arrive at the following situation: calculated at constant prices, it is 621.1 złoty for individual farmers, 517.3 złoty for agricultural cooperatives, and 393.7 złoty for state-owned farms. From this, it can be seen that the difference between individual farmers and agricultural cooperatives is 16.7%, while compared with state-owned farms, the output of individual farmers is 37.2% higher.

	If we compare from the perspective of the quotas and land taxes paid to the state, the burden of agricultural cooperatives is less than that of individual farmers, especially in terms of land taxes. The difference in these burdens that favors agricultural cooperatives is actually a subsidy from the state to agricultural cooperatives. Another subsidy is the additional expenditure of the state-owned tractor stations providing services to agricultural cooperatives. During the period from 1952 to 1955, the total amount of these additional expenditures reached approximately 1.7 billion złoty.

	Since not all agricultural cooperatives can pay the established minimum number of work-day wages, a part of the debts that agricultural cooperatives should repay to the state is allocated to pay work-day wages. From the national perspective, this money amounts to more than 500 million złoty. In this way, the income that agricultural cooperatives can use for distribution is artificially increased, making it possible to increase work-day wages by approximately 27%.

	In addition to these forms of state assistance, agricultural cooperatives have also received large loans from the state. The long-term and medium-term debts of agricultural cooperatives amounted to more than 1.6 billion złoty on December 31, 1955, and short-term debts were more than 900 million złoty.

	It can also be added that agricultural cooperatives also took advantage of preferential measures in purchasing artificial fertilizers.

	The economic situation of agricultural cooperatives can be briefly summarized as follows. The situation is very sad. Despite the large expenditures, the returns are small, and the production costs are high. I will not talk about the political aspects of the issue.

	It is for the above reasons that I have reservations about the part of the resolutions of the Seventh Plenary Session regarding the Party's agricultural policy, which was decided at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee.

	In examining the actual economic situation of our country, we find that there are other characteristics that are sufficient to cause deep concern.

	The practice of implementing the Six-Year Plan is: concentrating the maximum amount of investment in certain selected sectors without considering other aspects of economic life. However, the national economy is a whole. Some economic sectors cannot be sacrificed and others excessively favored, because losing the correct proportions will damage the entire economy.

	The rural housing problem should cause particular concern. Although the housing problem is also difficult in cities and residential areas, great efforts are already being made to build new houses, while the seriousness of the problem of repairing and maintaining houses in rural areas is simply shocking.

	The situation in social service undertakings, sanatoriums, or convalescent homes is not much better.

	I would like to emphasize again: I do not in any way deny the achievements of the Six-Year Plan. However, these achievements must be assessed from the actual situation, that is, we must look at these achievements from the economic situation, because the economic situation is the starting point for our Five-Year Plan. And this starting point has extremely great difficulties.

	We all face the question: how to solve these difficulties, what work needs to be done to overcome all these difficulties and move forward along a road that is becoming less and less rugged, and where to start. In order to achieve this goal, we must greatly change our previous practices.

	The key to solving these enormous difficulties is in the hands of the working class. And the attitude of the working class depends on the Party's policy formulated by the Party's leading bodies, on the skills of managing the country, and on the art of the government and all the highest bodies of the state.

	The working class recently gave the Party's leading bodies and the government a painful lesson. When the Poznań workers took up the weapon of strike on that black Thursday in June of this year and marched on the streets, they issued a powerful cry: Enough! This situation cannot continue! Turn back from the wrong path!

	When the Poznań workers ran into the streets of this city, they were not protesting against People's Poland, not against socialism. They were protesting against the widespread ills of our social system, which they also painfully felt, protesting against the distortion of the basic principles of socialism—that is their ideal.

	The working class is our class, our indomitable strength. The working class is ourselves. Losing it, that is, losing the trust of the working class, each of us in fact cannot represent anyone except himself.

	The clumsy attempt to say that the painful Poznań tragedy was caused by imperialist agents and provocateurs is politically very naive.

	Agents and provocateurs will always exist, will always be active, and will be everywhere, and will be active everywhere. But they can never determine the attitude of the working class anywhere. If agents and provocateurs could incite the working class to take action, then the conspiracy of the enemies of People's Poland and the enemies of socialism would be much easier and could easily achieve their goals. But the problem is that this is simply not the case.

	The reasons that caused the Poznań tragedy and made the entire working class feel deeply dissatisfied should be found among ourselves, among the Party's leadership and among the government. The tinder has been accumulating for many years. The Six-Year Economic Plan, which was vigorously promoted in the past as a new stage in raising living standards, has shattered the hopes of the broad masses of workers. The numerical trick of indicating that actual wages increased by 27% during the Six-Year Plan has proved to be a failure. It has only made the people angrier. It is necessary to abandon the attitude adopted by clumsy statisticians.

	The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union stimulated our country's political life and transformed it. A vigorous and sound trend has emerged among the broad grassroots of the Party, the working class, and the entire society. A powerful wave of criticism has emerged, criticizing the violence, deviations, and mistakes that affected all aspects of life in the past. Everywhere, especially at Party meetings and mass rallies in factories and enterprises, demands have been made to explain the causes of the ills and to take appropriate measures against those who bear the main responsibility for causing deviations in economic and political life. In particular, the working people want to know the whole truth, without embellishment or deletion.

	In the situation that occurred after the 20th Party Congress, it was necessary to take action quickly and consistently, draw conclusions from the past, treat the masses very frankly, and tell them the whole truth about the economic situation and the causes and roots of deviations in political life. However, the Party's leading bodies failed to quickly formulate a specific course of action. The fact that the Seventh Plenary Session was postponed several times is a proof of this.

	I have never lost faith in the wisdom, common sense, selflessness, and revolutionary attitude of the working class. I still believe in these precious qualities of the working class today. I believe that the Poznań workers would not have gone on strike, they would not have demonstrated on the streets, none of them would have used weapons, and the blood of our brother workers would not have flowed there, if the Party, that is, the Party's leading bodies, had told them the whole truth. The workers' demands must be recognized as legitimate without delay, it must be explained what things can be done today and what things cannot be done today, and the truth about the past and the present must be told to them. The truth cannot be avoided.

	The Party's leading bodies are afraid of this. The phenomenon of weakening confidence in the working class is universally and clearly evident in the Party's central and local organs.

	To manage the country requires the working class and the laboring masses to trust their representatives who are responsible for managing the country. This is the moral basis for exercising power on behalf of the laboring masses. Trust can only be regained if the obligations to those who give trust are fulfilled. Losing the trust of the working class means losing the moral basis of power.

	It is also possible to manage the country in this situation. However, the government must be a bad government, because this government must be built on bureaucracy, built on practices that violate the rule of law, and built on violence. The essence of the dictatorship of the proletariat is the broadest democracy of the working class and the laboring masses, and this essence loses its meaning in this situation.

	The working class could have regained trust in some people. This is normal. It is also normal for these people to leave their posts. To change everything bad in our lives, to change the current state of our country's economy, it is not enough to just replace some people. It can even be said that this is an easy thing to do. To eliminate everything bad that has accumulated over the years and hindered the development of political and economic life from our country's political and economic life, it is necessary to make great changes in our People's Government system, in the organizational system of our industry, and in the working methods of the state and Party organs. In short, it is necessary to replace all the bad parts in our country's socialist model, replace them with better parts, improve this model with the best existing model, and apply our own, more perfect style to this model. This is much more difficult. This takes time and effort, and it takes courage and wisdom. The main principles of these changes are partly included in the resolutions of the Seventh Plenary Session, partly we have also discussed today, and we will discuss them more than once in the future.

	What limits our possibilities in this regard today? First of all, it is the impatience of the working class, mainly due to living standards, and living standards are closely related to our economic situation. Even the greatest magician cannot pour water from an empty kettle.

	Many factories and enterprises do not operate normally and do not fully utilize their production capacity. The reason is that these factories and enterprises cannot be supplied with sufficient materials and raw materials. And these we must rely on imports, or we must expand our own supply base. Imports are closely related to our exports, and expanding the supply base requires time and financial resources. The current situation is: in many factories and enterprises, production capacity and the labor of workers are not being fully utilized by us.

	I have already talked about the threat we face of a lack of sufficient commodity supply in the domestic market; that is to say, we cannot supply a corresponding quantity of commodities with the overall increase in income.

	In this case, we must tell the working class the truth: now we cannot greatly increase wages, because the rope has been tightened to the point where it may break.

	I cannot say for sure when it will be possible to find further strength to raise the living standards of the working class. But this depends primarily on two factors: one, on the improvement of the management of industry and the entire national economy; and two, on the workers themselves, that is, on the increase in labor productivity and the reduction of production costs.

	The problem of changing industrial management is, in nature, a profound structural problem. What is involved here is precisely how to improve our form of socialism. The issue of worker autonomy in factories and enterprises, which has recently been discussed by workers, Party and state organs at all levels, ultimately, mainly concerns the issue of production and living standards that I have talked about. It is dangerous to put the entire economic machine on a new track without thoroughly testing the performance of the new machine that we want to create. We should very seriously welcome the initiatives of the working class on improving industrial management and on workers participating in enterprise management. This proves that the working class has great and reasonable confidence in socialism. The economic, political, and state leading bodies must work hard to help the workers' initiatives, so that the proposed methods can be summarized as much as possible. But as for large-scale measures, we should not be too hasty.

	The best conditions for conducting experiments in this regard can be found in the entire raw material industry and those factories and enterprises where the entire production process is complete, as well as those factories that can cooperate with other factories without encountering supply difficulties. Experiments should be started in these factories and enterprises without delay.

	I think we should conduct thorough research in order to decide, for example, whether we can implement larger material rewards in the coal mining industry that are strictly linked to the increase in coal production.

	Produce more, cheaper, and better—this is the road to raising the living standards of the working class and the people of the whole country. Worker autonomy must be based on this. The source of various material rewards that can be implemented under the current economic situation is here.

	In the specific case of a factory or enterprise, as long as one of the three factors of producing more, cheaper, and better is achieved, the income of the staff can be increased.

	The purpose of worker autonomy is to reduce production costs, so the problem of excessive personnel cannot be ignored.

	The responsibilities of the factory and enterprise management authorities and the central leadership of industry lie in ensuring that workers have the necessary and sufficient supplies to enable production to proceed normally, which means fully utilizing the labor of every worker in the factory and enterprise.

	Another more acute problem is streamlining the so-called overly large administrative organs.

	To build our economic life on a better foundation than in the past, the effort to produce more, cheaper, and better cannot be limited to the issue of worker autonomy, because this is only one part of the reconstruction work, one part of the organization and politics.

	In solving the problem of reducing production costs, both the worker autonomy organs and the factory administration must first know their actual production costs. This is extremely important for the entire economic life.

	There is a mistaken opinion that the law of value does not play a role under socialist production conditions. Therefore, in commodity transactions between state-owned enterprises, prices are forcibly stipulated, even lower than production costs.

	This economic policy is wrong. In short, the price system that has existed in our country's economy to date should be changed, and prices should be adjusted according to value. This change will eliminate many anomalies in our country's economic life. But, most importantly, this will make it possible for every factory and enterprise to determine its actual production costs.

	In our country's socialist economic system, every production factory should be based on genuine commercial accounting, not on the fictitious accounting that has existed until now. Our country's socialist economy, on the one hand, fully recognizes the necessity of central planning. At the same time, the necessity of the autonomy of socialist enterprises should be considered.

	Changing the prices of commodity transactions between state-owned enterprises, or enabling every enterprise to determine its actual production costs, will improve our current form of socialism.

	The line of developing handicrafts formulated by the Seventh Plenary Session must be put into practice. In this regard, the most difficult problem for the state is how to ensure the smooth flow of material supply. But there are also other reasons that affect the development of handicrafts. Tax policy, that is, the so-called extra tax estimation and levy, is the most important reason. We should adopt reasonable taxation methods so that handicraftsmen can produce without any doubt, that is, we should abolish the harmful extra tax estimation and levy system.

	Some corrections also need to be made to agricultural policy. Agricultural cooperatives that are basically sound should be given assistance in the form of repayable investment loans, and any kind of state subsidies should be abolished. Those agricultural cooperatives that have little prospect of development and will only lose money should not be given loans. We should propose the dissolution of cooperatives to the members of such cooperatives. In this case, the issue of repaying the state loans that were lent to the cooperatives in the past—that is, lent to the members of the cooperatives—arises. I think that just as it is not allowed to grant loans casually, it is not allowed to abandon the state money that has been allocated in the form of loans.

	I think that the agricultural cooperative movement can only develop under the following conditions:

	1. Participation in agricultural cooperatives is voluntary. This means that not only must no threats or psychological coercion be used, but also no economic coercion must be used. The estimation of taxes and the determination of quota deliveries can also become a tool of coercion.

	2. Cooperative members manage themselves. Cooperatives are nothing more than an autonomous agricultural production enterprise. The management committee is elected according to the free will of the members. The management of cooperative property should also be based on the wishes of the members.

	3. Cooperatives have the right to use their own money or, under certain conditions, state loans to obtain any machinery needed for their agricultural production or auxiliary workshops within the cooperative.

	Machine tractor stations should be established on a completely profitable principle, just like repair factories. They can own a certain number of giant agricultural machines to specialize in assisting agricultural cooperatives and individual farmers.

	4. The state provides indispensable loan assistance to cooperatives for investment purposes; gives them priority in concluding purchase agreements on the delivery of the most favorable agricultural raw materials; ensures that they are given priority in the provision of artificial fertilizers; and implements other similar forms of assistance.

	If the development of agricultural cooperatives may slow down due to the abolition of various forms of subsidies, we will not have any losses because of this, either in economic terms or in political terms. We can only benefit, both now and in the future.

	If the achievements we have made so far in the movement to establish agricultural cooperatives in our countryside are what they are today, then the reasons for this situation should not be found in the idea of collectivization itself; this idea is a good idea, a correct and reasonable idea, but it has been distorted due to bad policies and bad methods, and due to those who do not have sound economic ideas.

	We say that the countryside needs cooperative farming because it is a more advanced socialist mode of production. This is not because someone has come up with these dogmatic principles that are divorced from life, but because we hope to awaken a deep sense of social production collective among the working farmers, we hope to eliminate all forms of the system of man exploiting man, we hope to use machines as much as possible to reduce the hard labor of farmers, and we hope that everyone belonging to the farmer production collective will spend the least amount of labor and get the largest total output, so as to increase the harvest per hectare to the highest level. In this way, our farmers and workers—the people of the whole country—will live better. The social status of farmers will also change.

	This great socialist ideal of changing rural production relations not only needs state assistance in the process of realization. It also needs arduous propaganda and explanation work to make everyone aware of the importance of cooperative farming.

	The road to the widespread establishment of agricultural cooperatives in the Polish countryside is a long one. In our current situation of cooperative farming, there are many facts that make the peasant masses unwilling to participate in agricultural cooperatives. These facts must be eliminated.

	The practice of the past few years is that various collective working methods that farmers have adopted for a long time have been recklessly destroyed. Their common property—the machines—has been taken away. This practice is based on the premise that socialism can be built on the basis of poverty and the reduction of peasant property. Dogmatic minds cannot understand that under the People's Democratic system, all forms of cooperation help the countryside to realize socialism, these forms help to arouse the consciousness of common production, they increase both production and the people's living standards, and socialism can best be developed on the basis of the prosperity of the working farmers. There is nothing more correct than developing this kind of voluntary form of peasant association. Diverse modes of production collectives are the road for our Polish countryside to move towards socialism. These modes will form our form of socialism. Because we have decided to change the tasks of the state-owned machine tractor stations and tell agricultural cooperatives that they can purchase the machines they need in production, we are already changing the structural characteristics of our form of socialism.

	Another failure of the reckless agricultural policy of the past period is the economic bankruptcy of a large number of farms listed as the property of rich peasants. Equally reckless is the idea that is still being heard today: that the positive effect of the agricultural policy implemented in the past is that the bankrupt rich peasants surrender to the People's Government. This surrender could have been achieved at any time. There was no need to implement the so-called policy of restricting rich peasants for several years. This policy is actually not a policy of restricting exploitation, but a policy of destroying the farms of rich peasants. After all, even today, it is possible to make all the remaining wealthy farms that have not yet been destroyed surrender in large numbers. There is nothing easier than achieving this surrender, this cheap surrender, or, looking at it from the perspective of how much we pay for the import of grain, this is a somewhat expensive surrender.

	The improved agricultural policy is beginning to produce the first fruits. This is first felt by the countryside, which has increased its income by several billion złoty this year. In the long run, people should see further and more fundamental changes in agricultural policy. When this change occurs depends on the economic situation. What I am considering is the abolition of quota deliveries, which cannot become a system, become an economic characteristic of our system. Quota deliveries are a phenomenon of wartime conditions, not a characteristic. It cannot be considered that this form of payment from the countryside to the state is some unchangeable characteristic of building socialism. The prospect of abolishing quota deliveries does not exempt anyone from paying the taxes currently paid to the state. Quota deliveries are a tax paid in kind. Not only in our country, but everywhere in the world, taxes should be paid.

	The government should and must fight against all abuses of power and violations of the law; it should care and must care that no citizen, no farmer, is wronged by the authorities; but on the other hand, it must hope that citizens fulfill their obligations to the state.

	Quota deliveries are still one of the forms of state taxation today, and this tax must be paid in full. We must make this clear to ourselves, to the farmers, and to the People's Congress.

	I think it is necessary to revise the conditions for transferring fallow land—especially in the western and northern territories—to farmers for re-cultivation in favor of farmers.

	As for state-owned farms, I think it is first necessary to thoroughly change their organizational structure, and at the same time thoroughly reform the remuneration system for agricultural workers and staff.

	There are many possibilities for increasing agricultural production in our country. These possibilities depend on: first, correct and long-term agricultural policies; second, the industry providing various farms with appropriate agricultural machinery, especially artificial fertilizers; and third, improving the ability of every farmer.

	I would now like to talk about other issues that, like economic issues, are of particular concern to our entire Party and our entire country. What I have in mind is primarily the issue of the democratization and development of our lives, as well as the Party and state relations with our great brotherly neighbor—the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union.

	Our Party is the one that puts the slogan of the People's Government at the forefront of its wishes, and sincerely puts it there. The purpose of this government is to realize the most humane ideals—the socialist ideals. How could our Party, which is in the leading position of the Polish People's Government, allow so many deviations that occurred in the recent past to occur? We will conduct long-term research to get a complete answer to this question. It is contained in the question of the road to the construction of socialism and the formation of socialist forms.

	Simply put, the unchanging thing in socialism is the abolition of man's exploitation of man. The roads to achieving this goal can be different and indeed are different. They are determined by different times and places. The forms of socialism can also be different. It can be the form that arose in the Soviet Union, or it can be the form that we see in Yugoslavia, and it can have other different forms.

	Only through the experiences and achievements of various countries building socialism can the best form of socialism under certain conditions be produced.

	The Soviet Union was the first country in the world to have a socialist revolution. Lenin and the Bolshevik Party carried out for the first time in history the great task of turning socialist theory into a material and social reality.

	After the Second World War, the Soviet Union was no longer the only socialist country. People's China and a number of People's Democratic countries, including Poland, that have embarked on the road of socialist construction have emerged on the world stage. The workers' parties in these countries have encountered problems that did not actually exist before, and so has our Party. Among these problems are such problems as: the question of the road to socialism that is suitable for various countries—this to some extent affects the formation of socialist forms—as well as the question of mutual Party and state relations between the parties and governments of socialist countries.

	The mutual relations between the parties and states of the socialist camp do not become and should not become the cause of any complications. This is one of the main characteristics of socialism. These relations should be formed on the basis of the principles of international working-class solidarity, should be based on mutual trust and equality of rights, mutual assistance, friendly criticism when necessary, and should rationally resolve all disputes in a friendly and socialist spirit. Within the scope of this relationship, each country should have complete independence, and the right of each country to have an autonomous government of an independent state should be fully and mutually respected. The situation should be like this, and I want to say that the situation is beginning to become like this.

	Stalin, as the leader of the Party and the Soviet Union, formally recognized all the above principles, believing that all of this should be the characteristic of relations between socialist camp countries. He not only recognized these principles, but also announced these principles. However, in fact, these principles are incompatible with the manifestations of the cult of personality.

	The essence of the system of the cult of personality lies in the fact that a personal and layered ladder of worship is produced. Each such worship contains a certain area in which it functions.

	The person who is worshipped is an omnipotent person who knows everything, solves everything, guides everything, and decides everything within the scope of his actions. He is the most intelligent person, regardless of his personal knowledge, ability, or other personal conditions.

	It is not so bad if a sensible and humble person puts on the robes of this cult of personality. Such a person usually does not feel comfortable wearing such robes. It can be said that he feels ashamed of this garment and does not like to wear it, although he cannot completely take it off.

	Because no leader of a Party organization, even if he works collectively with the entire leading body, can work normally, because under such a system, that is, under the political system of the cult of personality, there are no conditions for working in this way.

	But the worse situation, even the completely bad situation, is when the honor of power, that is, the right to be worshipped, is seized by a mediocre person, an incompetent person, an incompetent executor, or a bad guy who pursues fame and fortune, this person recklessly and without any difference buries socialism.

	In this case, can the mutual Party and state relations between the People's Democratic countries on the one hand and the Soviet Union on the other hand be established on the principle of equality? Obviously not. The tightly organized system of the cult of personality, which destroys any independent socialist thought, makes this impossible.

	The system of the cult of personality has shaped living idols and limited the thinking methods of Party activists and Party members.

	It would be a big mistake and a confusion of concepts if someone insisted that the cult of personality and personal authority are the same thing. The difference between the two concepts lies in the fact that the cult of personality distorts socialist ideas and transforms them, causing the working people to lose confidence in socialism, while the authority of hundreds and thousands of Party leaders and People's Government officials greatly promotes the development of socialist construction and is indispensable in leading the Party and the state. However, this authority cannot be given to people, cannot be worn on the chest like a medal or an order. Authority must be earned, must be earned with reason and humility. The more people who have authority, that is to say, the more leaders or activists who are trusted by the working class and all the laboring people, the stronger our Party and our People's Government will be in Poland. That is why we say: We should make every effort to fight against the cult of personality and its remnants, and we should do our best to strive for authority.

	In Poland, this tragic fact also occurred, when some innocent people were killed. Many others (including Communists) were often imprisoned for many years, although they were innocent. Many people suffered brutal torture. Phenomena of terror and moral corruption prevailed. On the soil of the cult of personality, phenomena that violated and even abolished the deepest meaning of the People's Government arose.

	We have or are completely ending this system forever. We should be greatly grateful to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which gave us great help in eliminating this system.

	The various deviations and deformities in our lives in the past period that we are talking about today inevitably deeply shook the entire Party, the entire working class, and the entire country. Various trends swept the country, but the most powerful trend was the slogan demanding the democratization of our lives and the end of the system of the cult of personality that we are talking about forever. It should be said that the Party's leading bodies did not always quickly stand at the forefront of this sound movement with

    在波兰统一工人党第八次中央全会上
    瓦迪斯瓦夫·哥穆尔卡的发言
    新华社26日讯　据波兰通讯社华沙讯：瓦迪斯瓦夫·哥穆尔卡10月20日在波兰统一工人党中央委员会第八次全体会议上的发言摘要如下：
    自从党的政策发生了突然变化的八月全体会议以来，到现在已经有八年了，但是，这些年代是已经结束了的历史时期。我深深地相信：这个时期已经一去不复返了。
    在这些年代里，发生了许多不好的事情。那个时期遗留给党、工人阶级和全国人民的东西，在生活的某些方面，不仅仅是令人震惊的而已。
    两个半月以前，中央委员会第七次全体会议对于这个过去时期的积极方面和消极方面都作了估价，并且拟定了将来的行动指导原则。尽管我希望参加那次会议，可是我却不能如愿。
    我对于第七次全体会议的决议有某些保留。这些保留是关于对于过去的估价以及党在农业方面的政策的。
    除此以外，我认为这些决议是正确的，而且把它们当作正确的行动方针。在执行它们的过程中，它们将会需要更严密的解释和补充。在这些决议中没有提到当前某些重要的问题。其中有些问题是今天就可以解决的，因为它们已经成熟了。而其他的问题则必须等到它们在我们思想中已经成熟了并且具备了适当的条件的时候才能解决。
    我对于第七次全体会议的决议的保留意见，就对于过去的估价这一点来说，涉及经济和政治的问题。这些保留意见既关系到这种估价的是与非，也关系到造成错误和偏差的人的责任——由这种估价而产生的责任。
    第七次全体会议的决议谈到了六年计划执行过程中所取得的成就和所犯的错误。
    决议举出了在这个时期内我国工业，特别是重工业生产能力的广泛发展，认为这是六年计划的超过其他一切的最重要的结果。
    我一点也不抹杀我国所取得的任何成就。我们大家，同全国人民一样，为我国工业生产的增长而感到高兴。我没有理由来怀疑那些公布的工业生产增长的指数。我相信这些指数，认为它们是真的。然而有某些“但是”，它们迫使我对这种关于在过去六年计划期间取得的我国经济成就的估价来作一番重新的估价。
    让我们看一下六年计划在采煤方面的成绩。在1949年，即三年计划最后的一年，煤产量在七千四百万吨以上。在六年计划最后的一年1955年，煤产量是九千四百五十万吨。这些数字表明，煤产量增加了二千多万吨，如果这种增加是煤矿工业生产能力的提高，这真正可以认为是很大的成就。
    可是统计材料表明，矿工们在1955年超时工作了九千二百六十三万四千小时，这等于当时总的工作时数的15.5％，等于在正常的工作时间以外采掘了一千四百六十万吨的煤。至于煤矿工业的劳动生产率的情况，1949年每个工人每个工作日的采煤量等于一千三百二十八公斤。在1955年，跌到了一千一百六十三公斤，那就是说降低了12.4％。地下采煤工人的产量降低达每个工作日的7.7％。比起1938年来，每个煤矿工人每个工作日的产量在1955年降低了36％。
    关于煤矿工业的经济政策的特点是不能宽恕的考虑不周。当时采用了星期日工作制度，而这种制度只能够损害矿工的健康和体力，同时很难使煤矿设备保持能够进行正常工作的状态。当时还在部分的煤矿中采取了用军人和犯人工作的做法。采煤工作人员一直没有固定，每年更换的人数占很大的百分比。这个政策只能损害采煤计划，只能造成煤矿现在的状况。
    六年计划的目的，是要提高工人阶级和全国人民的生活水平。但是，在六年计划结束以后，在五年计划的第一年里，我们面对着日益增长的巨大经济困难。
    为了扩充工业，我们订立了大笔的投资贷款合同，而当我们需要偿还首批到期的贷款时，我们发现我们处在无力偿还的破产境地。我们不得不要求贷款人同意延期偿还。同时，这些采取机器和设备形式的贷款，相当大部分到现在、并且在以后很长时间还不能用在生产上，而其中一部分必须认为已是无可挽回的损失。
    尽管我们可以延期偿还，并且可以把目前这个五年计划期间该偿还的款项的一半延期到下一个五年计划去偿还，但是五年计划的支付平衡里还有着相当大的赤字。在这种情况下，已经制定的五年计划的现实性就受到很大的影响。
    我们知道，同货币数目相比，国内市场有缺乏足够数量的货物的危险。
    第七次全体会议的决议是不是谈到所有这一切呢？它们并没有。当然，决议对于过去作出了比较温和的估计，这个事实并不是最重要的。重要的是，要正确地制定出将来的计划，经济方面精确的分析是必不可少的。列举的这种事实决不能轻轻放过。
    在国民经济的农业方面（第七次全体会议给它的解释引起了我思想上的一些保留），从1949年开始，也就是在过去六年中，党发动了争取农业生产集体化的运动。在这个时期里，成立了大约一万个农业合作社，参加的农户大约有6％。
    在我国的情况下，正如在每一个没有多余的土地可供利用的国家的情况一样，农村政策的特点应当是不断努力加紧农业生产。要使波兰能够靠本国的资源来养活本国的人民，只有增加单位面积产量，增加每一公顷土地的农业产量。
    让我们看一下我国农业经济各部门（即个体经济、农业合作社和国营农场）每公顷土地的产品总额的价值。在1955年，有78.8％的农田在个体农户手里，合作社占有8.6％，国营农场占有12.6％。如果把这些农场所生产的总产量当作100，则总产量的分配情况如下：个体农户占83.9％，农业合作社7.7％，国营农场8.4％。
    我们如果估计一下每一公顷可耕土地产品总额的价值，就会得出这样一种情况：以不变价格计算，个体农户为621.1兹罗提，农业合作社为517.3兹罗提，而国营农场则为393.7兹罗提。由此可见，个体农户和农业合作社相差16.7％，而同国营农场比较，则个体农户的产量高出37.2％。
    我们如果从缴售给国家的定额和土地税的角度来比较，农业合作社的这类负担比个体农户的来得少，这在土地税方面尤其如此。在这些负担上的有利于农业合作社的差别实际上就是国家对农业合作社的一种津贴。另一项津贴就是国营拖拉机站提供给农业合作社的服务的额外的支出。在1952年到1955年期间，这些额外支出的总数共达大约十七亿兹罗提。
    由于并不是所有的农业合作社都能交付已定的最低限度的工作日工资，所以把农业合作社应偿还给国家的债务的一部分拨充支付工作日工资之用。从全国说来，这笔钱达五亿兹罗提以上。这样，农业合作社的可以用来分配的收入是人为地增加了，这样才有可能把工作日工资提高了27％左右。
    除了这些形式的国家帮助之外，农业合作社还从国家那里得到了大笔的贷款。农业合作社的长期和中期债务在1955年12月31日达十六亿兹罗提以上，短期的有九亿多兹罗提。
    还可以补充说，农业合作社在购买人造肥料方面也利用了优待办法。
    农业合作社的经济情况简单说来就是这样。这种情况很可悲。尽管支出很大，可是收效却少，生产成本反而高了。我且不谈问题的政治方面。
    就是为了上述原因，我对于第七次全体会议的决议中关于党的农业政策的部分持有保留意见，这政策是在中央委员会第五次全体会议上决定的。
    在检查我国实际经济情况的时候，我们发现还有其他的特点足以引起深深的关切。
    执行六年计划的实践是：在某些挑选出来的部门，集中了最高限度的投资，而没有考虑到经济生活的其他方面。但是，国民经济是一个整体。不能牺牲某些经济部门而对另外一些部门过分偏爱，因为丧失掉正确的比例，会使整个经济受到损害。
    乡村住房问题应当引起特别的关切。在城市里和居民区里，虽然住房问题也很困难，但是已经在从事巨大的努力建造新的房屋，而在乡村中修理和维护房屋问题的严重情况简直令人吃惊。
    社会服务事业、疗养地或者疗养院方面的情况也好不了多少。
    我愿意再一次着重指出：我一点也不抹杀六年计划的成就。但是，必须从实际情况出发来估价这些成就，就是，我们必须从经济状况来看这些成就，因为经济状况是我们五年计划的出发点。而这一个出发点有着十分巨大的困难。
    我们大家都面对着这样的问题：如何解决这些困难，要克服这一切困难并且沿着一条越来越不那么崎岖的道路前进，需要做些什么工作，从什么地方着手。为了达到这个目标，必须大大改变我们以前的作法。
    解决这些巨大困难的钥匙掌握在工人阶级手中。而工人阶级的态度则取决于党的领导机构所制定的党的政策，取决于管理国家的技巧，取决于政府和国家一切最高机构的艺术。
    工人阶级最近给予党的领导机构和政府一个痛苦的教训。当波兹南工人在今年6月的那个黑色的星期四拿起了罢工的武器并且到街上游行的时候，他们发出了一个有力的呼声：够了！这种情况不能再继续下去了！从错误的路上回过头来吧！
    当波兹南工人跑到这个城市的大街上去的时候，他们抗议的并不是人民波兰，并不是社会主义。他们抗议的是我们社会制度普遍存在的并且也是他们痛苦地感觉到的弊病，抗议的是对于社会主义——那是他们的理想——的基本原则的歪曲。
    工人阶级是我们的阶级，我们不屈不挠的力量。工人阶级是我们自己本身。失去它，也就是失去工人阶级的信任，我们每个人事实上除了代表他个人之外不能代表任何人。
    把痛心的波兹南悲剧说成是帝国主义特务和挑衅分子闹出来的，这种笨拙的企图在政治上是非常幼稚的。
    特务和挑衅分子始终会有，始终会活动，而且到处会有，到处会活动。但是他们在任何地方决不能够决定工人阶级的态度。如果特务和挑衅分子能够煽动工人阶级采取行动，那么，人民波兰的敌人、社会主义的敌人的阴谋就会容易得多，而且能够很容易达到他们的目标。但是问题在于事实并不如此。
    在波兰曾经有过这样的时候：常常受那些为非波兰利益服务的外国中心指挥的敌视社会主义的势力，拥有真正广泛的地下组织。曾经有过这样的时候：波兰人民政府受到武装进攻，因而它用武器进行自卫，结果我们成千成万的党员、兵士和公务人员死难了，这是艰苦的时候，它的痕迹到现在还没有从人们的心灵和情感中完全消失。这是建设人民波兰的最初的几年。但是在那些日子里，尽管人民政府如此困难，特务和地下组织的条件很有利，但是它们没有一个获得成功，或是能够分裂工人阶级的队伍，在政治上渗入工人阶级的任何部分。因为，如果反动势力能够在工人阶级的队伍里找到支持，工人阶级就不可能成为人民中间的领导的和最进步的部分。特务、挑衅分子或是反动分子从来不是工人阶级的鼓舞力量，他们现在不是，将来也决不会是。
    造成波兹南悲剧和使得整个工人阶级感到深刻不满的原因，应该在我们自己中间、在党的领导中间和政府中间去寻找。火种已经积累了多年。过去大力宣传说是提高生活水平的新阶段的六年经济计划，使广大劳动群众的希望破灭了。表示实际工资在六年计划期间增加27％的数字把戏，已证明是一种失败。它只有使人民更加生气。抛弃拙劣的统计家所采取的态度，是必要的。
    苏联共产党二十次代表大会刺激了我国政治生活，使它发生了转变。一种生气勃勃的、健全的潮流在党的广大基层、工人阶级和整个社会中间产生了。有力的批评浪潮出现了，批评过去，批评生活的各个方面无不遭受影响的暴力、偏差和错误。所有各处，特别是在工厂企业的党的会议和群众大会上，都提出了要求，要求解释造成弊病的原因，要求对那些在造成经济和政治生活中的偏差负主要责任的人采取适当措施。尤其是，劳动人民要知道全部真相，不加虚饰、亦不加删略。
    在第二十次党代表大会以后所发生的局势下，当时是有必要迅速地和始终一贯地采取行动，从过去得出结论，十分坦白地对待群众，把经济局势的全部真实情况和政治生活中发生偏差的原因和根源告诉他们的，但是党的领导机构未能迅速拟订出具体行动的方针。第七次全体会议数次延期举行就是这一点的一个证明。
    我从来没有对工人阶级的智慧、常识、忘我精神和革命态度丧失信心。我今天还是相信工人阶级的这些宝贵的特点。我相信，波兹南的工人原不会罢工，他们原不会在街上示威，他们之中原不会有人使用武器，我们的兄弟的工人的血原不会在那里流的，要是党，也就是说党的领导机构，曾经把全部真相告诉他们的话。必须毫不延迟地承认工人的要求是正当的，必须说明那些事情是今天所能办到的，那些事情是今天办不到的，必须把关于过去和现在的真相告诉他们。真相是避开不了的。
    党的领导机构害怕这一点。对工人阶级的信心的削弱现象在党的中央和地方机构中是普遍地明显存在的。
    要管理国家就需要工人阶级和劳动群众信任他们的掌握管理国家的责任的代表。这是代表劳动群众行使权力的道义基础。只有在对给予信任的人们尽了义务的条件下才能再次得到信任。失掉工人阶级的信任意味着失掉权力的道义基础。
    在这种情况下管理国家也是可能的。但是，政府一定是不好的政府，因为这个政府一定是建筑在官僚主义之上的，建筑在违反法治的做法之上的，建筑在暴力之上的。无产阶级专政的实质，是工人阶级和劳动群众最广泛的民主，而这种实质在这种情况下便失却了它的意义。
    工人阶级本可以收回对某些人的信任。这样做是正常的。这种人离开他们的职位也是正常的。要改变我们生活中一切不好的地方，要改变我国经济目前所处的状况，光是撤换一些人是不够的。这甚至可以说是件容易的事。要从我国政治和经济生活中消除多年来日积月累的、妨碍政治和经济生活的发展的一切不好的东西，有必要在我国人民政府制度方面，在我国工业的组织制度方面，在国家和党的机构的工作方法方面，作很大的改变。总之，有必要换掉我国社会主义模型中的一切不好部分，换上比较好的零件，用现有最好的型式来改进这个模型，把我们自己的、更加完善的式样应用在这个模型上。这就困难多了。这需要时间和努力，这需要勇气和智慧。这些改变的主要原则一部分包括在第七次全会的决议里，一部分我们今天也讨论到了，而且我们将来还要不止一次地讨论。
    今天在这方面限制我们的可能性的是什么呢？首先是工人阶级主要由于生活水平而产生的急躁情绪，而生活水平又是同我们的经济情况密切相关的。那怕有天大本领的魔术家，也不能从空水壶中倒出水来。
    许多工厂企业开工不正常，没有充分利用它们的生产能力。原因在于不能对这些工厂企业供应充分的材料和原料。而这些我们必须靠进口，要不然我们就必须扩充我们自己的供应基地。进口是同我们的出口密切相关的，而扩充供应基地需要时间和财力。眼前的处境是：在许多工厂企业里，生产能力和工人的劳动力没有被我们充分利用。
    我已经谈到我们面临着国内市场上缺乏充分商品供应的威胁；也就是说不能随着收入的总的增加，供应相应数量的商品。
    在这种情况下，我们必须把真相告诉工人阶级：现在我们不能再大大增加工资，因为绳子已经拉紧到可能崩断的程度。
    我现在无法肯定说什么时候才有可能找到进一步的力量来提高工人阶级的生活水平。但是这首先取决于两个因素：一，取决于对工业与整个国家经济的管理的改善；二，取决于工人自己，也就是说，取决于劳动生产率的提高和生产成本的降低。
    改变工业管理的问题在性质上是深刻的结构上的问题。这里所牵涉的正是如何改进我们这种社会主义的形式。工厂企业中的工人、各级党和国家机构最近讨论的工人自治问题，归根结蒂，主要也就是我所谈到的生产和生活水平的问题。把整个经济机器放在新的轨道上，而不对我们要创制的新机器的性能加以彻底的试验，那是危险的事。我们应当非常重视地欢迎工人阶级关于改善工业管理、关于工人参加企业管理的倡议。这证明工人阶级对社会主义有巨大的和合理的信心。经济、政治和国家的领导机构必须紧张地工作，帮助工人的倡议，以便只要可能就把所建议的方式加以归纳。但是就大规模的措施来说，我们应当不要操之过急。
    在这方面可以找到进行实验的最好条件的是整个原料工业和那些整个生产过程完整的工厂企业，以及那些可以同其他工厂合作而并不遇到供应困难的工厂。应当毫不延迟地开始在这些工厂企业中进行实验。
    我认为，我们应该进行彻底的研究，以便决定例如在采煤工业中我们是否能够实施同煤炭开采量的增加严格地联系起来的较大的物质奖励。
    生产得更多、更便宜、更好——这就是提高工人阶级和全国人民生活水平的道路。工人自治必须以这一点为基础。在目前经济情况下所可能实行的各种物质奖励的源泉就在这里。
    在某一个工厂企业的具体情况下，只要实现了生产得更多、更便宜、更好这三个因素之一，就能提高工作人员的收入。
    工人自治目的在于减低生产成本，因此对于人员过多的问题不能不加理会。
    工厂企业管理当局和工业的中央领导方面的职责在于保证工人有必要的充分供应来使生产正常进行，这意味着充分利用工厂企业每个工人的劳动力。
    另外一个更尖锐的问题是精简所谓过分庞大的行政机构。
    要把我们的经济生活建立在比过去好的基础上，要生产得更多、更便宜、更好的努力不能限于工人自治问题，因为这只是重建工作的一个部分，组织上和政治上的一个部分。
    在解决减低生产成本问题的时候，工人自治机构和工厂行政方面都必须首先知道自己的实际生产成本。这对整个经济生活来说是极其重要的。
    有这样一个错误的意见：在社会主义生产条件下，价值规律不起作用。因此，在国家企业之间的商品交易中，价格是强制规定的，甚至低于生产成本。
    这种经济政策是错误的。总之，迄今为止在我们国家经济中存在的价格制度应当加以改变，价格应当根据价值加以调整。这种改变将消除我国经济生活中的许多反常现象。但是，最重要的是，这将有可能使每个工厂企业确定它的实际生产成本。
    在我国社会主义经济制度中，每个生产工厂应当以真正的商业会计为根据，而不是以迄今为止存在的那种虚构的会计为根据。我国的社会主义经济一方面充分认识到中央计划的必要。同时应当考虑社会主义企业自治的必要。
    改变国家企业之间商品交易的价格，或者做到每个企业能够确定它的实际生产成本，那就将改善我们目前的社会主义的形式。
    第七次全体会议拟订的发展手工业的路线必须付诸实践。在这方面，对国家来说最困难的问题，也是如何保证物资供应的畅通。但是也有影响手工业发展的其他原因。税收政策，那就是所谓额外税估征，是其中最重要的原因。我们应当采取合理的征税方式，使手工业者生产没有任何疑惧，这是说我们应当取消有害的额外税估征制度。
    农业政策也需要作某些改正。对于基本上健全的农业合作社应当用要偿还的投资性贷款的形式给予帮助，任何种类的国家津贴应当废止。发展前途很小，只会赔钱的那些农业合作社，应当不予贷款。我们应该向这种合作社的社员提出解散合作社问题。在这种情形下，就产生了偿还过去贷给合作社——就是贷给合作社社员的国家贷款的问题。我认为，正好像不允许随随便便给予贷款一样，放弃以贷款形式所拨出的国家的金钱也是不允许的。
    我认为，农业合作社运动只有在下面几个条件下才能发展：
    一、参加农业合作社是自愿的。这就是说，不仅不得使用威胁或心理上强制的办法，而且也不得使用经济上强制的办法。税收的估定和缴售定额的确定，也可能成为强制的一种工具。
    二、合作社社员自己进行管理。合作社不是别的，正是一个自治的农业生产企业。管理委员会按照社员自由的意愿选出。合作社资财的管理也应根据社员们的意愿。
    三、合作社有权用自己的钱或者在一定条件下用国家的贷款获得为他们进行农业生产或社内现有的辅助工场所需要的任何机器。
    机器拖拉机站应当建立在完全赢利的原则上，正如修理工厂一样。它们可以拥有一定数目的巨型农业机器，专门援助农业合作社和个体农户。
    四、国家给予合作社不可缺少的贷款援助，作为投资之用；在缔结关于交付最有利的农业原料的合同购买协定时给予它们优先权；保证在提供人造肥料方面给予它们优先权；并且实行其他类似方式的援助。
    如果由于废除各种形式的津贴，农业合作社的发展也许减缓的话，我们将不会因此有任何损失，不论是在经济方面，还是在政治方面。我们只能有所获益，不论是在现在，还是在将来。
    如果说在我们在农村中建立农业合作社的运动中迄今所获的成就是今天这样的话，那么，造成这种情况的原因不应到合作化思想本身里去找；这种思想是好的思想，是正确的和合理的，但是由于坏的政策和坏的方法，并且由于那种没有健全经济思想的人而被弄得歪曲了。
    我们说农村需要合作化耕作，因为它是一种较高级的社会主义生产方式，这并不是因为某一个人想出了这些同生活脱节的教条式原则，而是因为我们希望在劳动农民之间唤起一种深刻的社会生产集体的意识，我们希望消灭一切形式的人剥削人的制度，我们希望尽可能地用机器来减轻农民的辛苦的劳动，我们希望属于农民生产集体的每一个人支出最少的劳动而得到最大的总产量，以便把每公顷的收获量提高到最高水平。这样，我们的农民和工人——全国人民将生活得更好。农民的社会地位也将发生变化。
    这一改变农村生产关系的伟大的社会主义理想在实现过程中不仅需要国家的援助。它还需要艰巨的宣传工作和解释工作，使人人知晓合作化耕作的重要性。
    在波兰农村普遍建立农业合作社，这条道路是漫长的。在我们目前的合作化耕作的情况中，有不少的事实使农民群众不愿参加农业合作社。这些事实必须要消除。
    过去一些年的做法是：农民们长期以来采取的各种集体工作方式都被轻率地破坏了。他们的共同财产——机器被拿走了。这种做法是根据社会主义可以在贫穷和农民财产减少的基础上建立起来的前提出发的。教条主义的头脑不能够理解：在人民民主制度下，一切方式的合作都有助于农村实现社会主义，这些方式有助于引起共同生产的意识，它们既提高生产量又提高人民的生活水平，社会主义正是在劳动农民富裕的基础上才能得到最好的发展。再没有比发展这类自愿形式的农民协会更正确的了。多样方式的生产集体是我们波兰农村走向社会主义的道路。这些方式将形成我们的社会主义的形式。由于我们决定改变国营机器拖拉机站的任务，并且告诉农业合作社，它们可以购买它们自己在生产方面所需要的机器，我们已经在改变我们社会主义的形式的结构特征。
    过去一段时期中的轻率的农业政策的另一方面失败，是列为富农财产的大量农庄的经济破产。同样轻率的是今天仍在听到的一种想法：认为过去所执行的农业政策的积极效果是破产的富农向人民政权投降。这种投降本来是可以随时获致的，没有必要执行好几年的所谓限制富农的政策，这种政策实际上不是一种限制剥削的政策，而是一种摧毁富农农庄的政策。毕竟，即使在今天也是可能使还没有摧毁的一切尚存的富裕的农庄实行大批投降的。再没有比获致这种投降，这种廉价的投降，或者从想到我们为谷物的进口付出多少代价方面来看则又是有些昂贵的投降更容易的事了。
    经过改进的农业政策正开始产生第一批果实。这首先由今年增加了几十亿兹罗提的收入的农村感觉出来。从长远说来，人们应该看到农业政策的进一步的、更基本的改变。这种改变在什么时候发生，要取决于经济形势。我考虑到的是废除缴售定额，这不能成为一个制度，成为我们制度的一个经济特点。缴售定额是战时情况的一种现象，而不是一种特点。不能认为，农村对国家的这种缴纳形式是建设社会主义的某种无可改变的特点。废除缴售定额的前景，并不使任何人可以免缴现在向国家交纳的税款。缴售定额是一种以实物形式缴纳的赋税。不仅在我国，全世界不论什么地方，税款是应该缴纳的。
    政府应该而且一定要同一切滥用权力、违反法律的现象作斗争；应该关心而且一定要关心，不让一个公民、一个农民受到当局的冤屈；但是在另一方面它必须希望公民向国家履行他们的义务。
    缴售定额在今天仍然是国家赋税的形式之一，而这种赋税必须全部缴纳。这一点，我们必须向我们自己、向农民们和人民会议说得清清楚楚。
    我认为，有必要在有利于农民的情况下，修改休耕地——特别是在西部和北部领土——转交给农民再行耕种的条件。
    就国营农场来说，我认为，首先是必需彻底地改变它们的组织结构，同时彻底地改革农业工人和职员的计酬制度。
    在我们国家内，提高农业生产的可能性是很多的。这些可能性取决于：第一、正确的和长期的农业政策；第二、工业给予各种农庄以适当的农业机器，首先是人造肥料；第三、提高每一个农民的能力。
    我现在要谈另一些问题，这些问题也和经济问题一样是我们全党和我们全国所特别注意的。我心中所想的首先是我们生活的民主化和发展同我们的伟大的兄弟邻邦——苏联共产党和苏联——的党的关系和国家关系这种问题。
    我们党是把人民政权的口号放在、并且是真诚地放在它的愿望的最前列的，这个政权的目的是要实现最人道的理想——社会主义理想，我们这个居于波兰人民政权的领导地位的党是怎么会容许不久的过去所发生的那么许多偏差得以发生的呢？我们将进行长期的研究才能得到对这个问题的完全的答复。它包含在社会主义的建设和社会主义形式的形成的道路的问题中。
    简单说，社会主义中的不变的东西就是废除人对人的剥削。实现这个目标的道路能够是不同的而且也的确是不同的。它们是由不同的时间和地点的情况决定的。社会主义的形式也能够是不同的。它可以是在苏联所产生的那种形式，也可以是像我们在南斯拉夫所看到的那种形式，它还可以有别的不同形式。
    只有通过各个建设社会主义的国家的经验和成就，才能产生在一定条件下的最好形式的社会主义。
    苏联是世界上第一个发生了社会主义革命的国家。列宁和布尔什维克党在历史上第一次进行了把社会主义理论变成一个物质的、一个社会的现实这一巨大任务。
    在第二次世界大战后，苏联不再是唯一建设社会主义的国家。世界舞台上出现了走上社会主义建设道路的人民中国和包括波兰在内的一些人民民主国家。这些国家的工人政党遇到了以前没有实际存在过的问题，我们的党也是如此。属于这类问题的有这样的问题：在适合于各国的情况下通向社会主义的道路问题——这在一定程度上影响社会主义形式的形成——以及社会主义阵营国家的党和政府之间相互的党的和国家的关系问题。
    社会主义阵营的党和国家之间的相互关系并不成为而且不应当成为造成任何复杂情况的原因。这是社会主义的主要特点之一。这些关系应当根据国际工人阶级团结的原则形成，应当以互相信任和权利平等、互相给予援助，在必要时互相友好批评，并且本着友好精神和社会主义精神使一切争执的问题得到合理解决为基础。在这种关系的范围内，每个国家应当有完全的独立，每个国家的拥有独立国家的自主政府的权利应当得到完全的和相互的尊重。情况应当是这样，而我要说，情况也正在开始成为这样。
    斯大林作为党和苏联的领袖，形式上承认上述的一切原则，认为这一切应当成为社会主义阵营国家之间关系的特点。他不但承认这些原则，并且宣布了这些原则。但是，事实上，这些原则同个人崇拜的表现是格格不入的。
    个人崇拜的制度的实质在于这样一个事实：产生了一个个人的和层层的崇拜阶梯。每一种这样的崇拜都包含它发挥作用的一定领域。
    受崇拜的人是无所不能的人，他在他的行动范围内无所不知，解决一切，指导一切，决定一切。他是一个最聪敏的人，不管他个人的知识、能力或是个人其他条件究竟如何。
    如果有一个通情达理和谦虚的人披上这种个人崇拜的大袍，那倒还不那么坏。这样的人通常穿上这样的服装并不舒服。人们可以说，他对这种服装觉得可耻，不喜欢穿它，虽然他不能够完全把它脱去。
    因为，没有一个党组织的领导人，即使他同整个领导机构集体进行工作，能够正常地工作，原因在于：在这样一种制度也就是个人崇拜的政治制度下，不存在这样进行工作的条件。
    但是更糟的情况，甚至完全不好的情况是，权力的荣誉，也就是受崇拜的权利，被一个庸人、一个昏庸无能的人、一个昏庸无能的执行者或者是一个追求名位的坏家伙夺到手的时候，这种人轻率地一毫不差地埋葬了社会主义。
    在这种情况下，人民民主国家一方和苏联另一方之间的相互的党和国家的关系能够建立在平等原则上么？显然是不能的。严密组织起来的、摧毁任何独立的社会主义思想的个人崇拜制度使得这成为不可能的了。
    个人崇拜制度塑成了活的偶像，限定了党的活动分子和党员的思想方法。
    如果有人硬说个人崇拜和个人权威是一回事，那将是一个大错误和混淆概念。两个概念之间的不同在于这个事实：个人崇拜歪曲社会主义思想而使之变相，使劳动人民失去对社会主义的信心，而数以百计、千计的党的领导人和人民政权的权威却大大促进社会主义建设的发展，而且是在领导党和国家方面所不可或缺的。然而，这种权威是不能赠给人们的，不能像一枚奖章或是一枚勋章那样配戴在胸前的。权威是要争取来的，是要凭理智和谦逊争取来的。拥有权威的人越多，就是说受工人阶级和全体劳动人民信任的领导人或活动分子越多，我们党和我国人民政权在波兰就越加强大。这就是为什么我们说：应该竭尽全力来同个人崇拜及其残余作斗争，应该尽我们的全部力量来争取权威。
    在波兰，也发生了这种悲惨的事实，当时有一些无辜的人被弄死了。另有许多人（其中包括共产党人）常常被监禁了许多年，虽然是无辜的。许多人遭受残暴的酷刑。恐怖和道德败坏的现象盛行。在个人崇拜的土壤上，产生了违反甚至取消人民政权的最深刻意义的现象。
    我们已经或者正在完全地使这种制度永远结束。应当大大感谢苏联共产党第二十次代表大会，这次大会在清除这种制度方面给了我们很大的帮助。
    我们今天所说的我们的生活在过去时期中的种种偏差和畸形现象，不可避免地深深地震动了整个党、整个工人阶级和整个国家。各种潮流席卷了国家，但是最强有力的潮流是要求我们生活民主化的、要求我们所说的个人崇拜的制度永远结束的口号。应该说，党的领导机构没有始终很快地同党一起站在这个健全的运动的前列，并且来引导这个运动。如果党的领导机构追不上这个运动，可以理解得到，党的组织也不会追上的。甚至发生了一种对民主化本身的进程非常有害的混乱。社会主义的所有敌人、人民波兰的所有敌人只会利用这种情况。那些同工人阶级和全国人民要使我们整个生活民主化的愿望没有丝毫共同之处的分子所进行的活动的加剧，也在党的领导机构和各省的某些同志中间引起了对于民主化的方法和它的实质犹豫不定。
    因此有必要坚决地对我们自己、党、工人阶级和全国人民这样说：
    民主化的道路是通往在我们的条件下建设最好形式的社会主义的唯一道路。我们决不离开这条道路，我们决以全力来保卫我们自己，不让别人把我们推到这条道路之外。我们决不容许任何人利用民主化的过程来破坏社会主义。我们的党站在民主化过程的前列，而只有党在和全国阵线的其他政党一致行动下才能够引导这个过程，使它真正地导致我们生活各方面关系的民主化以及我们制度的基础的加强而不是削弱。
    党和所有看到过去存在的弊病并且诚心地希望消除过去弊病在今天我们生活中的残余以增强我们的制度的基础的人，应该坚决地拒绝企图削弱我们同苏联的友谊的一切劝诱和言论。
    如果说，在过去我们党同苏联共产党之间以及波兰同苏联之间的关系中，并不是一切都是像我们认为它所应当成为的那样，那末，在今天说来，这是属于不可挽回的过去的事情了。如果在我们生活的这个或那个方面还有着需要解决的问题，那末应该以友好冷静的态度来解决。因为这样的做法应当成为社会主义阵营各党和各国之间的关系的特点。如果竟有人认为可以在波兰煽起反苏情绪，那末他就大错而特错了，我们决不允许损害波兰国家的切身利益和波兰建设社会主义的事业。
    个人崇拜制度以及它所引起的一切损害，都属于不可挽回的过去。基于平等和独立的原则的波苏关系，将在波兰人民中间产生一种同苏联友好的深刻的感觉，以致企图散布对苏联不信任的种子的任何尝试都不会在波兰人民中间找到响应。
    这种关系首先得到我们党的保卫，同时得到全国人民的保卫。
    为了使党能够有效地完成它的任务并且领导民主化的工作，党首先必须团结一致，必须在它的党员中和在党的生活中充分实行民主集中制的原则。党必须在实际工作中严格遵守列宁主义党内生活准则的全部理论原则。这些原则过去也是阐述过的，但是往往极少实践。党的领导的选举，党的生活的公开，在遵守多数的决定对于全体党员有约束力的原则下保留自己意见的权利——这个问题应当居于这些原则的前列。
    最后一条原则在目前是有特别重要意义的。党的行动一致，必须在这个基础上实现。党目前所面临的许多任务，只有向同一方向前进的一百五十万党员的共同努力才能胜利地完成。而这个方向已经为第七次全体会议所指出。目前的全体会议应该更严密地确定第七次全体会议所提出的总纲的内容。
    有必要大大改变我们党的实际工作，以及它的活动方法。
    政府的工作也需要予以改进。政治局在这方面已经通过了第一批决议。
    政府的组成必须通过适当的改组工作，以符合国家的真正需要。
    人们不会不看到，最近在负责保卫治安的国家权力机关中间也发生了某种程度的混乱。各种各样的无赖滋事行动已更加明显，而民警对这些事件常常没有适当的对付。必须向我们自己和一切可能有关的人表明：人民政权将惩处它的机构中一切滥用权力的情况，将要、而且一定要用同样的决心来扑灭一切破坏治安和公民安宁的行为。当民警出来保卫治安时，公众必须始终尊重他们和支持他们。一定不能容忍无赖们对保卫治安的民警有任何形式的侮辱，无赖们违犯法律必须受到严厉惩处。
    在过去一个时期的许多毛病中，还有这个事实：议会并没有尽到它在国家生活中的宪法方面的任务。我们现在正面临着新议会的选举，这个新议会应当在我们的政治和国家生活中占有宪法所指定给它的地位。把议会的作用提高到国家权力中最高机构的作用，大概将是我们民主化纲领中最重要的了。
    议会的首要任务是行使最高的立法和监察权力。应当创造使议会能够尽这种任务所不可缺少的条件。
    这就引起了这样一个问题：在法律准则上我们党打算给予议会什么保证呢？
    我认为：首要的是议会会议的问题，到目前为止，议会会议举行得太少了。议会的立法工作中具有特殊重要意义的是议会各委员会应采取一种能使它们把拟订法案的权利集中在它们手里的工作程序。
    这是出自这样一种假定：一部分议员应把履行他们的职责当作一种职业，这就是说，他们在履行议员职务期间，应当解除他们有薪金的职务。
    国务委员会颁布法令应限于紧急问题，同时，应保证议会有权废除或修改这些法令。
    议会应对政府和国家机关的工作实行大规模的监督。为保证这一点，对宪法进行某些修改是必要的。我认为，议会对于国家权力的执行机关的监督，应当由一个直接隶属于议会而不是像到现在为止一直是隶属于政府的一个机关来执行。隶属于议会的最高国家监察院应予以恢复。
    我还认为，议会应当有权对我国同其他国家签订的贸易协定施行监督。事实上，这些协定考虑到了国家的利益，并没有任何东西需要由少数人来加以监督。政府和议会让舆论知道关于我国的贸易协定的情况，将自然而然地制止关于我国对外贸易的各种荒谬谣言。
    议会也应该有权通过我们一切由政府缔结的和由国务委员会批准的同其他国家的条约。
    议会也有责任估计政府的工作，对于未能适当履行其职责的那些人作出结论，也应该在它的职权范围以内。
    对于议会的权力作合理的规定，甚至把这些权力扩大到宪法所规定的范围以外，同时把党对国家机构的任务作合理的规定，并不会导致议会和党的领导作用原则的政治实质之间的冲突。
    选举应该根据新的选举法进行，这个选举法将让人民选择，而不只是投票。这是一个非常重要的改变。团结在全国阵线的各党派和社会团体正在提出一个共同的竞选纲领。但是，任何纲领都不仅是由党派执行，而且也有代表这些党派行事的人们执行。那些得到最大信任的候选人将当选。很清楚，那些没有得到广大阶层的选民的信任的将不会被选入将来的议会中。
    重要的不仅是议会将拥有什么权力的问题。它在国家的生活和人民的生活中所将起的作用，在我国的民主化的进程中所起的作用，将在同样程度上取决于被选入议会的那些人。我们可以指示我们党提出最好的同志，提出那些同工人阶级和全国人民有最密切的联系的人们作为候选人。
    我们只能向我们在全国阵线的盟友建议，他们应该把那些不只是在口头上而且是在内心里关心共同拟订的竞选纲领的人们提出作为他们自己的议员候选人。
    同志们，中央委员会全体会议通过的决议将由我们毫无愧色地告诉全党、工人阶级和全国人民，因为我们告诉他们的是真相。而无保留地把真相告诉全国人民将使我们获得力量，将恢复劳动群众对人民政府、对我们党的充分信任。要执行我们的计划，这种信任是不可缺少的。
    我们提出了一切形式的、包括在报刊上进行批评的批评自由的基本原则，但是我们有权利要求每一个批评应该是建设性的和公正的，这种批评应该帮助克服目前时期的困难，而不是使困难增加，或者有时甚至用煽惑人心的方式来处理某些现象和问题。
    我们有权利要求我们的青年，特别是大学生，应该在这次中央委员会全体会议所将作出的决议的范围内来热忱地寻求导致改善我们目前现实情况的道路。许多事情我们都可以原谅青年人。但是生活是不原谅任何人的，即使青年人的轻率的行为也不会原谅。
    我们只能为我们的青年同志的热情感到欣慰。因为将接替我们担任党内和国家机关的职位的是青年们。但是我们完全有理由要求他们应该把奋发的热情同党的智慧结合起来。我们党应该对青年们说清楚：要在这个伟大的、重要的民主化进程的前列迈进，但是始终要望着你们的领导，波兰全国人民的领导——望着工人阶级的党，望着波兰统一工人党。
