　　The General Who Lost the Battle
　　The United Nations Security Council adopted the "Six Principles" for resolving the Suez Canal issue on the 13th. The Egyptian people have achieved a major victory in their struggle to safeguard their sovereignty. This immediately aroused the frantic cries of a small number of warmongers in Western colonial countries. During the debate on the Suez Canal issue in the French National Assembly on the 16th, members of right-wing parties fiercely criticized the Mollet government for "not being resolute enough" on the canal issue in their speeches. Le Chandelier, a member of the right-wing Independent Republican Party, even demanded in his speech that Foreign Minister Pineau be replaced because, it is said, this is the traditional French practice: replacing generals who have lost battles and demoting them to unimportant positions so that they will not cause further harm.

　　In his reply, Pineau himself admitted that Western countries "have suffered several setbacks." However, it would be somewhat unfair to say that Pineau did not do his best to force Egypt to submit. Since the Suez Canal issue arose, Pineau has tried his best in every public speech to convince people that Egypt's just action to safeguard its sovereignty is so-called "aggression" and "robbery"; he also traveled busily between London and Paris to put together a majority for Western countries; he also tried every means to provoke relations between Egypt and Arab countries, trying to isolate Egypt in the Arab world; he also sent French troops to Cyprus to threaten Egypt with force. And when all these efforts proved ineffective, and the Security Council adopted the six principles for negotiation, Pineau also declared that "the trump cards in our hands have not been used up," and expressed his unwillingness to "play the role of a deceived husband" because of the ambiguous attitude of the United States. Mr. Pineau still has plenty of energy left.

　　Pineau has worked hard enough. The failure of Western countries is not because Pineau, Dulles, or Lloyd did not work hard enough; but because Egypt's cause is just, and a just cause can never be destroyed. If Le Chandelier wasn't sitting in the parliament ranting and raving, but volunteered to be in the forefront for the cause of colonialism, I guarantee that he would also be a general who was brought down after losing a battle.

### 吃败仗的将军

    吃败仗的将军
    联合国安全理事会在13日通过了解决苏伊士运河问题的“六项原则”。埃及人民在维护自己主权的斗争中取得了重大胜利。这立即引起了西方殖民国家极少数好战分子的疯狂叫嚣。法国国民议会在16日辩论苏伊士运河问题的时候，右翼党派的议员们在发言中猛烈抨击摩勒政府在运河问题上“行动不够坚决”。右翼的独立共和党议员勒祥德在发言中甚至要求撤换外交部长比诺，因为，据说，这是法国的传统做法：撤换吃了败仗的将军，把他们降级调到不重要的职位去，这样，他们就不会进一步为害了。
    比诺在答辩中自己也承认西方国家“已经遭受到几次挫折”。但是，要说比诺在迫使埃及屈服上没有卖尽力气，那就未免有些冤枉。从苏伊士运河问题发生以来，比诺在每一次公开发言中，都竭力要人们相信埃及维护自己主权的正义行动是所谓“侵略”和“劫夺”；他也曾仆仆风尘，往来于伦敦和巴黎之间，为西方国家拼凑多数；他也曾想方设法挑拨埃及同阿拉伯国家之间的关系，想把埃及在阿拉伯世界中孤立起来；他也曾把法国军队派到塞浦路斯去，对埃及进行武力威胁。而当这一切努力终归无效，安全理事会通过谈判的六项原则以后，比诺还宣布“我们手里的王牌还没有用完”，并且表示他不愿意因为美国的暧昧态度而“扮演一个被愚弄的丈夫的角色”。比诺先生还着实余勇可贾哩。
    比诺是够卖力的了。西方国家的失败并不是由于比诺、杜勒斯或者劳埃德没有卖力气；而是因为埃及的事业是正义的，正义的事业是始终摧毁不了的。如果勒祥德不是坐在议会里面大发脾气，而是自告奋勇，为殖民主义的事业一马当先，保管他也是一名被拉下马来的吃败仗的将军。　　（丁）
