    Radioactive Cobalt-60
    Artificial radioactive isotopes are currently recognized as a relatively effective new weapon for treating cancer.

    There are many types of radioactive isotopes used for treatment, among which radioactive Cobalt-60 is the most powerful and widely used. The powerful radioactive Cobalt-60 treatment machine (also called Cobalt Bomb) designed by Soviet scientists is highly efficient and powerful.

    Radioactive cobalt, like radium, can emit beta and gamma rays. Radium also emits alpha rays. Since only the emitted gamma rays are used in cancer treatment, it is necessary to filter out the alpha and beta rays during use. The beta rays emitted by radium are stronger and need to be blocked with a 0.5 mm thick platinum sheet. However, platinum sheets are expensive, and such thick platinum sheets can also block some of the useful gamma rays. The beta rays emitted by radioactive Cobalt-60 are weaker and can be blocked with a 0.07 mm thick platinum sheet or even a stainless steel sheet. This not only greatly reduces costs, but also allows for more effective utilization of gamma rays. At the same time, the gamma rays emitted by radioactive Cobalt-60 are much more uniform than those emitted by radium, so adjusting the radiation dose is more accurate and the treatment effect is more reliable. In addition, when using X-rays to treat cancer, the tumor size is subject to certain restrictions, but the use of radioactive Cobalt-60 is more free and convenient. A treatment machine containing radioactive cobalt with a radium equivalent of 20 grams can be used to treat tumors distributed 3 to 5 cm deep; a treatment machine containing radioactive cobalt with a radium equivalent of 400 grams can be used to treat deeper internal organ tumors. In addition to this, radioactive Cobalt-60 can be placed in specially made needles and placed directly into the tumor or body cavity, or it can be placed in specially made small tubes, and then placed on a wax model made according to the human body surface morphology to directly irradiate the affected tumor area. This can further reduce the damage of radiation to the human body.

    Using radioactive Cobalt-60 to treat cancer is more effective than using X-rays and radium. For example, the cure rate for laryngeal cancer treated with radium is 68%, while the cure rate with radioactive Cobalt-60 can reach 82%. Some surgeons believe that cancers that cannot be surgically removed can restore patients to health after treatment with radioactive Cobalt-60.

    放射性钴60
    人工放射性同位素是目前公认为治疗癌症较有效的一种新武器。
    治疗用的放射性同位素的种类很多，其中威力最大、应用最广的是放射性钴60，苏联科学家设计的强力的放射性钴60的治疗机（又叫钴炮），效率高，威力大。
    放射性钴同镭同样都能放出乙种和丙种射线，镭同时还放出甲种射线，由于在治疗癌症时只使用它们放出的丙种射线，因此在使用时，需要设法滤过甲种和乙种射线。镭所放出的乙种射线较强，需用0.5毫米厚的白金片来挡住它。但是白金片价值昂贵，而且这样厚的白金片也能挡住一部分有用的丙种射线。放射性钴60所放出的乙种射线较弱，只需用0.07毫米厚的白金片甚至用不锈钢片就可以挡住了，因此不仅成本大大减低，而且可以更多地有效地利用丙种射线。同时，放射性钴60所放出的丙种射线比镭所放出的丙种射线要均匀得多，因此调节放射线量也比较准确，治疗效果也比较可靠。另外，用爱克司射线治疗癌症的时候，肿瘤量受到一定的限制，但是使用放射性钴60却比较自由方便，一只装有放射性为二十克镭当量钴的治疗机可以用来治疗分布在三到五厘米深的肿瘤；一只装有放射性为四百克镭当量钴的治疗机，则可以用来治疗长得更深的内部器官肿瘤。除这以外，还可以把放射性钴60装在特制的针内直接放到肿瘤内或体腔内，或者把它装在特制的小管内，而后放在根据人体表面形态制成的蜡制模型上，直接照射患肿瘤的部位。这样可以进一步减少放射线对人体的损害。
    利用放射性钴60治疗癌症比用爱克司射线和镭治疗的效果好。例如喉头癌用镭治疗好的为68％，而用放射性钴60治疗好的可达82％。有些外科医生认为无法割治的癌症经过应用放射性钴60治疗以后，病人可以恢复健康。　（骧）
