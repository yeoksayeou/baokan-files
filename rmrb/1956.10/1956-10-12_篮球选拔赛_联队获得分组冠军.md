Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The joint team composed of the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" Men's Basketball Team and the Beijing Institute of Physical Education Men's Basketball Team defeated the Macau Men's Basketball Team by a score of 185 to 59 tonight, securing first place in the group round-robin stage of the Chinese Olympic Team Basketball Selection Tournament.

Prior to this game, the Tianjin Men's Basketball Team, which had previously won against the joint team by one point in the group round-robin, lost to the Chinese People's Liberation Army Public Security Army Men's Basketball Team, which had previously lost to the joint team by fifteen points, by a score of 87 to 100. This resulted in the following situation: the Tianjin team and the Public Security Army team both had two wins and one loss in the group round-robin, while the joint team had one win and one loss. Therefore, for the joint team to secure first place, it not only had to defeat the Macau team but also had to score as many points as possible in this game.

The joint team consistently employed a full-court man-to-man defense and a fast-paced offensive strategy throughout today's game, keeping the shorter Macau players in a passive position.

    篮球选拔赛
    联队获得分组冠军
    据新华社11日讯　由中国人民解放军“八一”男子篮球队和北京体育学院男子篮球队组成的联队今晚以一百八十五比五十九战胜了澳门男子篮球队以后，获得了中国奥林匹克运动队篮球选拔赛分组循环赛的第一名。
    在这场比赛以前，在分组循环赛中曾经赢过联队一分的天津男子篮球队以八十七比一百败给了曾经输给联队十五分的中国人民解放军公安军男子篮球队，于是情况变成这样：天津队和公安军队在分组循环赛中都是胜两场、败一场，联队是胜一场、败一场，因此联队要取得第一名不仅要战胜澳门队，而且还要在这场比赛中获得尽可能多的分数。
    联队今天一直采取全场人盯人的防守战术和快速的进攻战术，使个子矮小的澳门队员一直处在被动地位。
