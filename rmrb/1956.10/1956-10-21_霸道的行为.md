	Domineering Behavior
	Dongmu District of Macheng County, Hubei Province, borders Huai'bin County, Henan Province. In September, "Pioneer" and other advanced agricultural cooperatives in Muzidian Township, Dongmu District, Macheng County, sent people to Huaibin County, Henan, to buy fifty-five piglets and sows, spending a total of more than 1,382 yuan. When they passed through Huangchuan County, the county's Food Company detained their pigs, saying, "You are from Hubei, and we are from Henan. Pigs are not allowed to leave the province." They had no choice but to return to the Macheng County People's Committee to obtain a certificate (proving that the pigs were bought for the agricultural cooperatives' own breeding). The comrades of the Huangchuan County Food Company then said that a county certificate was not enough, and that they needed a provincial certificate. After repeated pleas to no avail, they traveled more than a thousand li back and forth to Wuhan to obtain a certificate from the Hubei Provincial Finance and Trade Office. Upon seeing the certificate, the comrades of the Huangchuan Food Company said, "We don't want a certificate from Hubei Province; we want a certificate from Henan Province." Finally, when they ran to Zhengzhou and obtained a certificate from the Henan Provincial Finance and Trade Office, the Huangchuan County Food Company released the pigs. By this time, the piglets had been confined for twenty-three days, and five had already died. The five pigs were worth 142.5 yuan in total, but the company only compensated 78.2 yuan. The remaining fifty pigs, due to being confined in a pen for a long time, all became ill, and twenty-four died within three days of being driven home, leaving only four that could be salvaged. This time, the four cooperatives lost a total of 360 workdays and more than 1,000 yuan, of which more than 60 yuan was wasted on travel expenses.
	The Huangchuan County Food Company's illegal obstruction of the transit of live pigs is extremely egregious. It is hoped that the Henan Provincial Supervisory Department will investigate this matter and take necessary action.

    霸道的行为
    湖北省麻城县东木区和河南省交界。9月间，麻城县东木区木子店乡“先锋”等高级农业社，派人到河南淮宾县买五十五口小猪和母猪，共花一千三百八十二元多钱。他们路过潢川县时，该县食品公司就把他们的猪扣住了，说：“你们是湖北的，我们是河南的，猪是不准出省的”他们没有办法，只得返回麻城县人民委员会开证明信（证明买猪是为农业社自己喂养的）。潢川县食品公司的同志又说不要县的证明，要省的证明。他们经再三哀告无效，又往返跑了一千多里路，到武汉市向湖北省财粮贸办公室要来了证明信，潢川食品公司同志见证明后又说：“不要湖北省的证明信，要河南省的证明”。最后当他们跑到郑州，向河南省财粮贸办公室要了证明，潢川县食品公司才把猪交出来。这时，小猪已关了二十三天，有五头已被关死了。五头猪共值一百四十二元五角，公司只赔七十八元二角。其余五十口猪，因长期关在一个圈内，都得了病，赶回家不到三天又死去了二十四头，最后只剩四头可以抢救。这次四个社共损失了三百六十个劳动日和一千多元，其中因来回跑路，就白浪费了六十多元盘川。
    潢川县食品公司非法阻拦生猪过境的行为十分恶劣，希望河南省监察厅检查这件事情，并给以必要的处理。　　　　　　　　游弟波
