    Beautiful, Magical, Rich
    Xu Chi
    Yunnan is a paradise of exotic flowers and rare herbs;
    The plum blossoms of the Tang Dynasty still bloom every year;
    After the azaleas and camellias have blossomed; the epiphyllum and night-blooming cereus bloom;
    Then the fragrance of orchids floats in the air.
    All seasons are filled with flowers and sunlight;
    Fragrant fields; colorful forests;
    The air is transparent; the streams are transparent;
    The lawns are so soft you want to roll around on them.
    The scenery of these mountains and rivers is so beautiful that it is endearing,
    But the beauty is not only in the mountains and rivers.
    As if in the mirror-like Butterfly Spring,
    Reflecting strings of butterflies hanging among the leaves;
    Like the reflection of the snow-capped mountains in the Jade Lake water,
    In the rich treasure of myths and legends,
    Reflecting the beauty of people's hearts—
    Ah, not only beautiful, but also magical!
    Listen to the farm girls let loose their voices,
    They sing the most tender verses:
    Sincere love, love to the end of time;
    Love freely, or die for lack of freedom.
    Listen to the white-haired shamans striking the chimes and磬,
    Singing the more than a thousand volumes of the Dongba scriptures.
    You don't need to read Genesis from the Old Testament,
    You don't need to rush to translate the Greek epics.
    Who doesn't know the Sani girl Ashima?
    The Naxi people have their Jade Dragon Third Kingdom;
    The Bai people have the Looking-Husband Cloud; the Dai people have the peacock,
    And the powerful songs of the Kawa people.
    Look at the dozens of fraternal ethnic groups,
    Those in the high and cold mountainous areas, still wearing sheepskin robes,
    The girls in the south, however, have put on glass gauze.
    Clothing is different, life is even more different.
    And reality is even more magical than mythology,
    Look at the slave owners striding forward,
    Followed by slaves, holding up the long hem of his robe.
    The magic is not that the slave system still exists,
    Nor that primitive communist society still exists,
    Nor that the slaves have finally been liberated,
    Nor that primitive communist society is about to disappear.
    When the district work committee gallops across the mountains,
    He brought back a decision to the mountainous area from the Party Congress:
    To transition directly to socialism!
    "Peaceful consultation on land reform" has become like a strange tale;
    "Gradual direct transition" is truly magical!
    Not long ago, they were still slash-and-burn farming,
    Now they are trying out double-wheeled double-furrow plows;
    The most backward tribes want to leap to the sky in one step,
    Within seven years, they will catch up with the advanced ethnic groups!
    But Yunnan is beautiful, magical, and rich!
    Botanists say it is a paradise for plants;
    Hydraulic engineers say it has ideal rivers;
    Geologists say it is the treasure house of the motherland.
    From cedar to coffee, trees of cold, temperate, and tropical zones,
    It possesses half of the country's plants.
    On the Jinsha River, not only is there a Long March ferry crossing,
    A giant hydropower station is already under construction.
    And the most beautiful, perhaps, are the non-ferrous metals,
    Non-ferrous metals are the most magical flowers of Yunnan.
    And the richest of the rich is copper,
    Copper! I don't know how to sing your praises!
    I need the heat and the heat of the reverberatory furnace,
    I want to refine my verses as if they have been through that refining furnace,
    My heart needs to be like the sensitive copper core of the thousands of miles of extended power lines;
    Beautiful Yunnan is a copper kingdom;
    In magical legends, it once rained copper from the sky.
    The future Kunming will be a glorious and splendid beautiful, magical, and rich copper capital.
    Ah! This industrial base of myriad colors,
    To speak of it in prose language is very unnatural,
    To get close to it, you can only sing about it,
    It is such a beautiful, magical, and rich place.

    美丽、神奇、丰富
    徐迟
    云南是个奇花异卉的乐园；
    唐朝的梅花还在年年开放；
    开过杜鹃茶花；琼花昙花开；
    随后是幽兰香飘浮在空中。
    四季都是鲜花和太阳光；
    芬芳的原野；五彩的森林；
    空气也透明；溪水也透明；
    草坪柔软得你想去打滚。
    这山川风景美丽得使人钟情，
    但美丽的不止是山川风景。
    好像在明镜似的蝴蝶泉中，
    映入一串串蝴蝶垂在树叶间；
    又像玉湖水中的雪山倒影，
    神话传说的丰富宝藏之中，
    反映着人们的心灵的美丽，——
    啊，不仅仅美丽，而且神奇！
    听农家姑娘们放开歌喉，
    她们唱出了最缠绵的诗句：
    真挚的爱情，爱就爱到永远；
    自由地爱，不自由毋宁殉情。
    听白发巫师叩击着钟磬，
    唱出那一千多卷的东巴经。
    你不用从旧约读创世纪，
    不用急于翻译希腊的史诗了。
    谁不知道撒尼姑娘阿诗玛？
    纳西人有他们的玉龙第三国；
    白族有望夫云；傣族有孔雀，
    还有佧佤人的强悍的歌声。
    看那数十种的兄弟民族，
    那高寒山区的，还披着羊皮挂，
    南部的姑娘却穿上了玻璃纱。
    服装既不同，生活更多差异。
    而现实甚至比神话还要神奇，
    看昂首阔步前行的奴隶主，
    后跟奴隶，手捧他长长的衣裾。
    神奇的却不是奴隶制度还存在，
    更非原始共产主义社会还存在，
    也不是奴隶终于已经解放，
    更非原始共产主义社会要消失。
    当区工委跨马越过重山峻岭，
    他从党代会带回山区一个决定：
    要向社会主义直接过渡！
    “和平协商土改”已经像一种奇谈；
    “逐渐直接过渡”却是真正的神奇！
    他们不久以前还在刀耕火种，
    现在已试用双轮双铧犁；
    最落后的部落要一步登天，
    七年之内，要赶上先进民族！
    但云南美丽、神奇，而且丰富！
    植物学家说它是植物的天堂；
    水利工程师说它有理想的江河；
    地质学家说它更是祖国的宝库。
    从雪松到咖啡，寒温热带的树，
    全国的植物，它占有了半数。
    金沙江上，不仅有长征渡口，
    巨型水电站已经在兴建之中。
    而最美丽的，也许是有色金属，
    有色金属是云南最神奇的花朵。
    而丰富之中最丰富的，是铜，
    铜啊！我不知怎样将你歌颂！
    我需要热力和那反射炉的热力一样，
    我要精炼我的诗句像经过那精炼炉一样，
    我的心需要如同那千万里延伸的、电线的敏感的铜心；
    美丽的云南是一个铜的王国；
    神奇的传说中曾经天雨铜。
    未来的昆明将是光辉灿烂的一座美丽、神奇、丰富的铜都。
    啊！这万紫千红的工业基地，
    用散文语言来讲，很不自然，
    要接近于它，只能将它歌唱，
    它是这样美丽、神奇、丰富的地方。
