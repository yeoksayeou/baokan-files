Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 16th -- According to the Hungarian News Agency, "Free People's Daily" published a resolution of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party on the 14th. This resolution cancels the decision made by the Political Bureau in November 1955 to expel Comrade Imre Nagy from the Party.

The resolution stated: "Although Nagy committed political errors, the nature of these errors is not sufficient to constitute grounds for expelling him from the Party. Comrade Rakosi's personal opinions had a great influence on the decision to expel Nagy. Considering all of this, the Political Bureau has restored Comrade Nagy's Party membership rights. The Political Bureau recommends that the Central Committee immediately discuss the unresolved issues in this matter, point out the real mistakes that Comrade Nagy made, and clarify what excesses and errors were in the previous decision of the Party."

    匈劳动人民党中央恢复纳吉的党籍
    新华社布拉格16日电　据匈牙利通讯社报道，“自由人民报”14日刊载了匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会政治局的一项决议。这项决议取消了政治局在1955年11月作出的开除伊姆雷·纳吉同志党籍的决议。
    决议说：“虽然纳吉犯了政治错误，然而这些错误的性质不足以构成把他开除出党的理由。对于作出这项开除纳吉的决议，拉科西同志个人的意见曾经起了很大的影响。考虑到所有这一切，政治局恢复了纳吉同志的党员权利。政治局建议中央委员会立即讨论在这件事情上的仍未解决的问题，指出纳吉同志真正犯过的错误，并且弄清楚党以前的那项决议有些什么过份和错误的地方。”
