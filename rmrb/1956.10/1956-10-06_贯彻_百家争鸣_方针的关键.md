The implementation of the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy is key.

In recent years, driven by national economic and cultural construction, China's academic circles have presented a thriving atmosphere. Debates on different views have gradually unfolded in various fields of social science. Some of the academic issues raised are directly related to the country's real life. For example, important issues in the study of modern Chinese and certain minority languages need to be scientifically judged as soon as possible to help with the reform of Chinese characters and the creation of writing systems for minority nationalities. Other academic debates, such as the periodization of ancient Chinese history and the emergence of Chinese capitalism in historical research, may be discussed for a long time without rushing to a conclusion. However, solving these problems is still practically significant. It can advance the research of this field of science and enrich the content of historical materialism education for the masses. There is no doubt that implementing the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy will most effectively promote the resolution of existing academic debates, open up broad avenues for new research, and advance social science research to a new stage.

In the past, our academic criticism was not always conducted very well. Academic criticism is originally mutual encouragement and mutual assistance in research work. It is difficult for researchers and critics, no matter how knowledgeable, to be completely correct on every point. Only through criticism and discussion is it possible to learn from each other's strengths and make improvements. Some of our academic criticisms and discussions have deviated from this positive meaning and turned into sectarianism and emotional disputes. Some academic criticisms lack specific analysis. Critics use labels as weapons to completely negate the other party. Those who are criticized lose confidence and dare not stick to their own opinions, while those who criticize also think that the criticized works are completely worthless and not worth considering. On the issue of academic authority, we sometimes lack a correct attitude. It is understandable that in a certain period, a few people in a field of science have deeper attainments and are admired by others, and even regarded as authorities in that field. However, some people sometimes do not correctly distinguish between respecting scientific achievements and personal worship, and there are concerns about blindly worshiping authority, rejecting new ideas, or hesitating to put forward their own ideas. We should respect the scientific achievements of scientists with profound attainments, but not engage in personal worship, let alone blind worship. Recently, the above-mentioned situations have been changing. However, the academic community still needs to continue its efforts to establish a good academic atmosphere of free discussion and seeking truth from facts.

To realize the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy, it is not enough for the academic community to support this correct policy and establish a good academic atmosphere. We also need to take some specific measures to promote and help. First, we must increase the necessary professional research institutions to strengthen weak disciplines and develop new disciplines. China is a multi-ethnic country, and there is no special institution to study ethnology. China is a major Eastern and world power, and has close ties with its neighbors and countries around the world. Relevant professional research institutions have not yet been established. Law is an important science, and we do not yet have a professional research institution. These need to be gradually established. Once we have institutions, we must also strengthen the workforce and strengthen the professional research team. At present, the workforce in the research institutions of philosophy and social sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is still very weak. The research institutes with the smallest number of people have long existed with the so-called "four-one system," that is, one director, one deputy director, one researcher, and one associate researcher. It is difficult to carry out work if there are research institutes without sufficient personnel. At the same time, we must also improve the current methods of using many materials in party and state organs. Some materials should be confidential, but most of the materials can be provided to scientific workers for research. However, due to inappropriate confidentiality systems, researchers cannot see real-world materials, which makes it difficult for them to express opinions on many real-world issues in socialist transformation and socialist construction, and they hesitate to move forward, let alone "compete." Even more important is that researchers must be able to have time to sit down and truly conduct research work. Researching social sciences and researching natural sciences have their own characteristics, but they require tireless labor and a lot of time, which is common. Only when everyone has truly conducted in-depth research can they speak out and compete for results. Researchers themselves must be good at using their time, and the relevant departments of the Party and the state and scientific leading organs must constantly pay attention to this issue from all aspects. Some departments, in order to strengthen the leadership of the cause, want to place some excellent scientists who are specially engaged in scientific research in administrative leadership positions in the departments. I think this is worth considering. Because there are too few professional researchers, and they need to be replenished. If a few people with expertise are transferred away, it will inevitably weaken research work, and this is not conducive to the long-term interests of the development of the Party and the country's scientific cause. Because it is difficult to imagine the leapfrog development of science without long-term scientific research reserves.

    贯彻“百家争鸣”方针的关键
    范文澜
    最近几年来，在国家经济文化建设的推动下，我国学术界呈现欣欣向荣的气象，不同见解的争论，在社会科学各个领域里逐渐开展起来。已经提出的学术问题中有一些是和国家现实生活有直接联系的。例如关于现代汉语和某些少数民族语言研究中的重要问题，就需要尽快地作出科学判断，来帮助进行汉文字改革和少数民族的文字创制工作。另外一些学术争论，例如历史研究中的中国古史的分期，中国资本主义萌芽等问题，则不妨长期讨论，不急于作出结论。但是解决这些问题仍有实际意义，它可以推进本门科学的研究，充实向群众进行历史唯物主义教育的内容。贯彻百家争鸣的方针，毫无疑问，会最有效地促进现有学术争论的解决，为新的研究开辟广阔道路，把社会科学研究推进到一个新的阶段。
    以前我们的学术批评，不是常常进行得很好的。学术批评本来是研究工作中的互相砥砺、互相帮助。研究者和批评者不论知识多么广博，要做到自己在每一点上都十分正确那是很困难的。经过批评讨论，才有可能取长补短、精益求精。我们有些学术问题的批评和讨论，离开这种积极意义，变成了门户之见，意气之争。有些学术批评缺少具体分析。批评者拿大帽子作武器，把对方一笔抹煞，受到批评的人失去自信，不敢坚持自己的意见，看批评的人也以为被批评的作品是百无一是，不值一顾。在学术权威问题上，我们有时也缺少正确的态度。一门科学在一个时期中，有少数人造诣较深，受到别人的推崇，以至尊为某门科学的权威，这是可以理解的。但是，有的人有时把对尊重科学上的成就和对个人崇拜没有加以正确区分清楚，存在有盲目崇拜权威，排斥新的见解，或者自己另有见解，也瞻前顾后，不敢提出来的顾虑。我们对有深厚造诣的科学家，应该是尊重其科学成就，而不是个人崇拜，更不是盲目崇拜。近来上述这些情况，正在发生变化。但是还需要学术界的继续努力，来树立自由讨论，实事求是的良好的学术风气。
    要实现百家争鸣，仅仅是学术界拥护这个正确的方针和树立了好的学术风气，还是不够的。我们还要采取一些具体措施，加以推动和帮助。首先要增设必要的专业研究机构，来加强薄弱的学科，发展新的学科。中国是一个多民族的国家，还没有专门的机构来研究民族学，中国是东方和世界大国，与四邻各国和世界各国都有密切的联系，有关的专业研究机构还没有成立，法学是一门重要的科学，我们也还没有专业的研究机构，这些都需要逐渐建立起来。有了机构，还必须充实人力，加强专业研究的队伍。目前中国科学院哲学社会科学的研究机构中的人力仍是很薄弱的。人数最少的研究所长期地存在着所谓“四一制”，就是一个所长、一个副所长、一个研究员、一个副研究员。有研究所而不充实人力，很难开展工作。同时也要改进目前党和国家机关中许多资料的使用办法。有些资料应当是机密的，绝大部分的资料是可以供给科学工作者进行研究的。可是由于不适当的保密制度，致使研究工作者看不到现实资料，这就使他们对社会主义改造和社会主义建设中的许多现实问题很难发表意见，趑趄不前，“争鸣”更是谈不到。还有更重要的，是研究人员要能够有时间坐下来真正进行研究工作。研究社会科学和研究自然科学各有特点，但是需要不疲倦的劳动，需要支付大量的时间，这一点是共同的。只有大家真正进行了深入的研究，才能鸣得起来，争出个结果。研究工作者自己要善于利用时间，党和国家的有关部门及科学领导机关均需不断地从各方面来注意这个问题。有些部门为了加强事业的领导，想把某些优秀的专门从事科学研究工作的科学家安置在部门行政领导岗位上，我认为这是值得考虑的。因为专业研究人员本来太少，正需补充，若再将有素养的少数人也调开，势必削弱研究工作，而这对党和国家科学事业发展的长远利益是不利的。因为没有长期的科学研究的储备是很难想像到科学的飞跃的发展的。
