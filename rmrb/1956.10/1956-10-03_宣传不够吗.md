    Not Enough Propaganda?
    After the Republican National Convention in San Francisco, William Van Asing, a Republican in California, wrote to the editor of "The New York Times," arguing that the Republican Party's propaganda on "racial equality" was still very poor. He cited historical examples, warning against losing the black vote.
    It seems that this Republican is very familiar with the tricks of the campaign. Like other party hacks, he has absolutely no sympathy for the rights and demands of black people, but he understands that the six million black votes are crucial in the competition between the two parties for the power of the White House, and some nice-sounding slogans must be used to win them over.
    But this Republican strategist has overlooked this truth: soap bubbles are bound to burst, and the bigger they are blown, the easier they are to burst. The Republican Party, in this respect, as in other matters, has already blown enough big soap bubbles.
    For example, the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision prohibiting racial segregation in public schools was a big soap bubble. The Republican Party boasted in its campaign platform about the Supreme Court's decision, saying: "This Republican administration has made more progress in this area (referring to the prohibition of racial discrimination) than in any other period of equal length in the past eighty years." However, everyone knows that the Supreme Court's decision is regarded as waste paper by racists, and the Republican government has not yet taken any serious measures to crack down on the increasingly rampant activities of the Ku Klux Klan in recent years.
    The expulsion of black American female student Lucy from the University of Alabama shocked the world. Despite the Supreme Court's decision and several subsequent rulings that she should return to school, she still cannot return.
    The U.S. government propaganda machine defends itself by saying that the Lucy incident is an isolated one and cannot prove that racial discrimination prevails in the United States. However, to the embarrassment of these propagandists, similar incidents that violate the Supreme Court's decision have occurred one after another, and racists everywhere use the atrocities of burning crosses, lynching, beatings, and threats to treat black people, so that the U.S. President has been repeatedly questioned at press conferences and has nowhere to escape.
    When reporters asked what effective measures were being prepared to stop this lawless violence, the President replied: "According to the law, under normal circumstances where order can be maintained and riots prevented, the federal government cannot interfere in the affairs of a state, unless the state can no longer handle the events that have occurred." He knows very well that in some states where racial discrimination is most prevalent, the people in power are fanatical racists or their direct accomplices.
    Even "The Washington Post" believes that it is very irresponsible for the President of the United States to take such a "third-party attitude."
    Therefore, for campaign strategists, it is not an easy problem to solve to win the votes of black people and not offend racists and the big plantation owners and monopoly capitalists in the southern states who stand behind the racists. What makes them even more uneasy is that sweet words are increasingly losing their appeal. Black people are increasingly bravely standing up to fight for their rights. (Ya)

### 宣传不够吗

    宣传不够吗
    在共和党的旧金山全国代表大会以后，加利福尼亚州的一位共和党人威廉·范·阿斯廷写信给“纽约时报”的编者，认为共和党对“种族平等”的宣传，还做得很差。他举出历史的例子，警告说：当心失掉黑人选票。
    看来，这位共和党人十分熟悉竞选的法门。他和其他的党棍子一样，对黑人的权利和要求决没有任何同情心，但是他懂得六百万黑人的选票在两党争夺白宫权力的竞争中是举足轻重的，必须使用一些动听的口号来笼络他们。
    但是这位共和党策士忽略了这个道理：肥皂泡是要破的，越吹得大，越容易破。共和党在这方面，也和在其他问题上一样，吹的肥皂泡已经够多够大的了。
    例如，1954年美国最高法院作出的在公立学校中不准实行种族隔离的决定，这是一个很大的肥皂泡。共和党在竞选纲领中大肆吹嘘最高法院的决定说：“这一届共和党政府在这方面
  （指禁止种族歧视）取得的进步比过去八十年间任何同样长的时期内所取得的进步来得多。”但是，大家都知道，最高法院的决定被种族主义者视为废纸，而共和党政府迄今未采取任何认真的措施来取缔近年来日益猖狂的三K党活动。
    美国黑人女学生露茜被亚拉巴马州立大学开除的事件，轰动了世界。尽管有了最高法院的决定，还经最高法院几次判决她应该回到学校去，但她还是回去不了。
    美国政府宣传机器辩解说，露茜事件是个别的，不能说明种族歧视在美国盛行。但是，使这些宣传家丢脸的是，违背最高法院决定的类似事件，一个接着一个发生，而且种族主义者到处使用火烧十字架、私刑、殴打和威胁的暴行来对待黑人，使得美国总统一再在记者招待会上被问得遁逃无路。
    当记者问到准备采用什么有效措施来制止这种无法无天的暴行时，总统的回答是：“按照法律，在能维持秩序和阻止暴乱的正常情况下，联邦政府是不能干预一个州的事情的，除非这个州已不能处理发生的事件。”他明明知道，在一些种族歧视最盛行的州里，执掌着大权的，就是狂热的种族主义者或者是他们的直接帮凶。
    连“华盛顿邮报”也认为，作为美国的总统，采取这种“第三者的态度”是非常不负责任的。
    因此，对于竞选策士来说，既要骗取黑人的选票，又要不得罪种族主义者和站在种族主义者后面的南方各州的大农场主和垄断资本家，是一个并不容易解决的难题。更使他们不安的是，甜言蜜语已越来越失掉吸引力。黑人正在越来越勇敢地站起来为自己的权利进行斗争。　（亚）
