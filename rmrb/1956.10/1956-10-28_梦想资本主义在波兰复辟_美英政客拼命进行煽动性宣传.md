Xinhua News Agency, October 26th: In recent days, officials and bourgeois newspapers in the United States and Britain have been conducting inflammatory propaganda regarding the situation in Poland.

Harboring dreams of restoring capitalism in Poland, officials in the United States and Britain have been constantly making remarks aimed at provoking discord between Poland and the Soviet Union. The United States has even threatened to take measures to promote the so-called "liberation" of Poland.

According to reports, US President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles have been in frequent contact for days, "closely watching" the development of the Polish situation. State Department officials are also studying policies towards Poland "comprehensively."

Eisenhower said he "fully sympathizes" with the Polish people he called "enslaved."

Dulles even bluntly stated many divisive remarks and interfered in Poland's internal affairs. He said that the United States has been working on Poland, which is the so-called "inspiring the ideals of freedom and constantly making the Polish people aware of this ideal."

Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson also advocated using "foresight and skill" to persuade Poland to break away from the socialist camp. He believes that the Polish issue should be submitted to the United Nations when necessary. At the same time, he advocates that the United States provide "economic assistance" to Poland.

British Foreign Office officials, commenting on the development of the political situation in Poland, believe that Western countries should behave with "restraint" and "tact."

Some British newspapers, after a relatively calm assessment of the situation in Poland, have made a relatively sober judgment. For example, The Times said: "It would be foolish to think that the new rulers of Poland want to break with Russia" because "they are Communists as well as Poles." The Daily Telegraph also warned: "It would be both naive and dangerous to expect the kind of dramatic events that would involve a realignment of camps."

### 梦想资本主义在波兰复辟  美英政客拼命进行煽动性宣传

    梦想资本主义在波兰复辟
    美英政客拼命进行煽动性宣传
    据新华社26日讯　这几天来，美国和英国的官方人士和资产阶级报纸一直在对波兰局势进行煽动性的宣传。
    美英两国的官方人士怀着在波兰复辟资本主义的梦想，不断发出挑拨波苏关系的言论，美国方面甚至扬言要采取措施来促成波兰的所谓“解放”。
    据报道，美国总统艾森豪威尔和国务卿杜勒斯连日接触频繁，“密切注视”波兰局势的发展。国务院的官员也在“全面地”研究对波兰的政策。
    艾森豪威尔说，他“完全同情”被他称为“被奴役的”波兰人民。
    杜勒斯甚至赤裸裸地说出了许多挑拨离间和干涉波兰内政的话。他说，美国一直在对波兰进行工作，这就是所谓“鼓舞自由的理想并且不断地使波兰人民注意到这种理想”。
    民主党总统候选人史蒂文森也主张“凭远见和技巧”来说服波兰脱离社会主义阵营。他认为在必要时应该把波兰问题提交联合国，同时，他主张美国对波兰进行“经济援助”。
    英国外交部官员在评论波兰政治局势的发展时认为西方国家应该表现得“有节制”些和“圆滑”些。
    英国也有些报刊在比较冷静地估计了波兰的局势之后，作出了比较清醒的判断。例如“泰晤士报”说：“如果认为波兰的新统治者们希望同俄国决裂，那将是愚蠢的看法”，因为“他们除了是波兰人外，还是共产党人”。“每日电讯报”也警告说：“指望会有调整阵营的那种戏剧性的事件，那将是既天真又危险的。”
