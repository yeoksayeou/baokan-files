Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Prime Minister Tanka Prasad Acharya of the Kingdom of Nepal delivered a broadcast speech to the Chinese people on the Central People's Broadcasting Station. He said that the foundation of the ancient friendship between China and Nepal, which has recently been restored, is firmly built on the common interests and aspirations pursued by mankind. The Prime Minister listed the common points between China and Nepal, saying that both of our countries cherish and safeguard national independence. We hate aggression from any side because we have never attempted to aggress against others. We strive for the interests of ordinary people because we recognize that the present era is the era of ordinary people. We have infinite confidence in the wisdom of the people. Our two countries are also jointly fighting for another great ideal. This great ideal is world peace—peace throughout the world and friendship between human beings. This can be easily seen in our opposition to any form of aggression and our strict adherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. I would also like to point out that both of our countries have a sufficient spiritual foundation to effectively and purposefully realize this ideal.

The Prime Minister said that when I think of these common points, unless one is an extreme pessimist, one would think that the future of friendship between China and Nepal is bleak. Countries that are combined for narrow selfish interests will immediately break up when the improper purposes that prompted this combination are achieved. However, between us there is a spiritual connection and brotherhood, with a traditional foundation, and the ideals that we are jointly striving for today promote our friendship. I think the story of this beautiful friendship is endless. It can only flourish more and more brightly, becoming something that all who have eyes will praise together.

The Prime Minister's speech was broadcast to the Chinese people tonight, after he recorded it at the invitation of the Central People's Broadcasting Station before leaving Beijing. In his speech, the Prime Minister first reviewed the long history of friendship and cultural ties between the peoples of China and Nepal.

In his speech, the Prime Minister talked about his visit to China. He said, I met with your government leaders in a very harmonious atmosphere. I felt that they were gentle, humble, and very friendly. Their attitude towards me was friendly and kind, and I saw with my own eyes that this great country did not have the slightest tendency towards great-power chauvinism and complacency.

The Prime Minister said, friends, I saw farmers working in agricultural production cooperatives in China. I saw workers happily engaged in industrial production. I saw nurseries and kindergartens caring for and educating children, enabling mothers to work in national construction posts. I saw you using steel for peaceful purposes, to manufacture machine tools, seamless steel pipes, trucks, and ocean liners. Develop heavy industry. I saw your dance performances and heard your rich and colorful music. I admired your paintings, both modern and ancient. Your acrobatics amazed me. In short, over the past twelve days, I have broadly seen many aspects of your people's lives.

I congratulate you on your courage, which is manifested in your frank attitude of seeking opinions and criticism. We have criticisms to offer. I admire the tremendous transformation of China, which is undoubtedly caused by the Chinese people. Maintaining the unity of all nationalities while maintaining the basic elements of democracy and preventing it from being harmed is not an easy task. To industrialize the vast China, which was once classified as an agricultural country, is also not an easy task. However, under the leadership of your capable leaders, you are turning what was considered impossible into possible and proving what was considered unprovable. Of course, all of this is just one aspect of a driving force, which is the new spirit cultivated by the Chinese people. They have endless enthusiasm for building the country, and at the same time, they have infinite confidence in the future they are building for themselves every day.

I pay tribute to the immortal spirit of New China. This is a superior quality on which a country can become a great country. As a friend of New China, I wish it good luck and smooth sailing on its voyage to the future.

The Prime Minister finally said that China and India are the joint initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence (Panchsheel). These five principles are being proven day by day to be a more effective foundation for establishing friendly relations between countries of all sizes. I believe that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are the only way to eliminate current misunderstandings and suspicions between countries. I hope that China and India will do their best to implement these great principles in Asia and throughout the world.

　　阿查里雅首相向我国人民广播
    中国和尼泊尔之间的友谊将会蓬勃发展得愈加光明灿烂
    新华社8日讯　尼泊尔王国首相坦卡·普拉萨德·阿查里雅在中央人民广播电台对中国人民发表广播演说。他说，中国和尼泊尔两国最近恢复起来的古老友谊的基础，是牢牢地建筑在人类所追求的共同的利益和愿望上的。首相列举中尼两国的共同点说，我们两国都珍爱和维护国家的独立。我们痛恨来自任何方面的侵略，因为我们从来没有侵略别人的企图。我们为普通人的利益而努力，因为我们认识到目前的时代是普通人的时代。我们对于人民的智慧具有无限的信心。我们两国还共同为另外一个伟大的理想而奋斗。这个伟大的理想就是世界和平——全世界的和平和人类之间的友善。这在我们反对任何形式的侵略，和严格遵守和平共处五项原则的事实上是很容易看出来的。我还想指出，我们两国都有充分的精神基础来有效地、有目的地实现这个理想。
    首相说，当我想到这些共同点以后，除非是一个极端悲观的人才会认为中国和尼泊尔两国友谊的前途是黯淡的。为了狭隘的自私利益而结合起来的国家，在达到了促成这种结合的不正当的目的的时候，马上就会散伙。但是，我们之间是一种精神联系和兄弟关系，具有传统的基础，我们今天共同争取的理想，又促进了我们的友谊。我认为这个美好的友谊的故事是说不完的。它只能蓬勃发展得愈加光明灿烂，成为凡是有眼睛的人都共同赞颂的东西。
    首相的演说是他在离开北京以前应中央人民广播电台的邀请录音后在今晚向中国人民广播的。首相在讲话中首先回顾了中尼两国人民悠久的历史友谊和文化联系。
    首相在讲话中谈到了他在中国访问的情况。他说，我在非常和谐的气氛中和你们的政府领袖们见了面。我感到他们文雅，谦虚，并且非常友好。他们对我的态度是友好的，亲切的，我亲眼看到了这个伟大的国家没有一点大国主义和自满的倾向。
    首相说，朋友们，我在中国看到了在农业生产合作社里工作着的农民。我看见了工人们愉快地从事工业生产。我看到了托儿所和幼儿园照顾和教育着孩子们，使母亲们能够在国家的建设岗位上工作。我看到你们把钢铁用在和平事业上，用来制造工作母机、无缝钢管、卡车和海洋轮船。发展重工业。我看到了你们的舞蹈表演，听到了你们丰富多采的音乐。我羡慕你们的绘画，无论是近代的或是古代的。你们的杂技表演使我感到惊奇。总而言之，过去十二天当中，我概括地看到了你们人民生活的许多方面。
    我祝贺你们的勇气，这种勇气表现于你们那种坦率地征求意见和批评的态度。我们有批评可以提出来。我倒是很赞赏中国的巨大转变，而这种转变毫无疑问都是中国人民造成的。保持各民族间的团结，而又能维护民主的基本因素，使它不受损害，这不是一件容易的事情。要使曾经被列为农业国的幅员辽阔的中国工业化也不是一件容易的事情。但是，你们在你们能干的领袖的领导之下，正在使被认为不可能的事情变成可能，并且证实了被认为不能证实的事情。当然，所有这些只是一个动力的各方面，这个动力就是中国人民所培植的新精神。他们对建设国家有无穷的热情，同时，他们对于每天在为自己建设着的将来，抱有无限的信心。
    我向新中国不朽的精神致敬。这是一种最优良的品质，在这种品质的基础上，一个国家能成为伟大的国家。作为一个新中国的朋友，我祝它有好运气并且在通往将来的航程中一帆风顺。
    首相最后说，中国和印度是和平共处五项原则（潘查希拉）的共同发起者。这五项原则一天天更有效地被证明是各个大小国家建立友好关系的基础。我相信，和平共处五项原则是消除目前各国之间的误会和猜疑的唯一办法。我希望，中国和印度将尽最大的努力，把这些伟大的原则在亚洲和全世界贯彻。
