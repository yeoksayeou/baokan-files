Xinhua News Agency, 5th. President Sukarno and the senior officials who accompanied him on his visit to China, this morning inspected the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force at an airport near Beijing, and watched a performance by jet fighters.

President Sukarno, accompanied by Marshal Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense, and General Liu Yalou, Commander of the Air Force, reviewed the Air Force officers, pilots, and mechanics lined up to welcome him, and then came to a long row of jet fighters parked on the airfield. He climbed a ladder and carefully examined the interior of a cockpit of one of the aircraft. A pilot answered some of the questions he asked in the cockpit.

President Sukarno and other distinguished guests then came to the front of the platform to watch the flight performance. At this time, four silver jet fighters slid out of the runway and flew toward the distance to the north. In a moment they sped over the heads of the spectators from the northeast, and people simply did not have time to see them clearly. Zhao Shaochang, the political commissar of this air force unit, told President Sukarno that this was a low-altitude flight by a squadron formation. The current flying speed is 900 kilometers per hour, and it is only 80 meters above the ground.

Next, the same aircraft took off to perform stunts. It performed continuous downward inversions, somersaults, inverted flight, vertical "8"s, and ascending rolls in the air above the viewing platform.

When the pilot came to report to the President that the flight performance was over, President Sukarno thanked them.

To commemorate President Sukarno's visit to the Chinese People's Air Force, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force fighter unit presented President Sukarno with a model of a jet fighter. After accepting the gift, the President said to Political Commissar Zhao Shaochang: Thank you, I believe your air force will develop day by day.

Before the President left the airport, General Liu Yalou introduced Colonel Liu Shanben, who was the first to revolt from the Kuomintang Air Force, to meet the President.

    苏加诺总统观看喷气机表演
    新华社5日讯　苏加诺总统和同他一起来中国访问的高级官员今天上午在北京附近的一个飞机场上参观了中国人民解放军空军，并且观看了喷气歼击机的飞行表演。
    苏加诺总统由国防部长彭德怀元帅和空军司令员刘亚楼上将陪同检阅了列队欢迎他的空军军官、飞行员和机械士以后，随即来到一长列停放在飞机场上的喷气式歼击机面前。他登上扶梯仔细观看了一架飞机座舱的内部。一位飞行员在座舱内回答了他提出的一些问题。
    苏加诺总统和其他贵宾们来到观看飞行表演的台前。这时候，四架银色的喷气式歼击机滑出跑道飞向北面的远方。一会儿它们从东北方向疾速地掠过了观看的人们的上空，人们简直来不及看清它们。这个空军部队的政治委员赵绍昌向苏加诺总统说，这是中队编队低空飞行。现在的飞行速度是每小时九百公里，离地面只有八十公尺。
    接着是一架同样的飞机起飞作特技表演。它就在观看台的上空连续进行下滑倒转、翻跟斗、倒飞、垂直“8”字和上升翻滚等飞行表演。
    当飞行员来向总统报告飞行表演完毕的时候，苏加诺总统向他们表示感谢。
    为了纪念苏加诺总统这次对中国人民空军的参观，中国人民解放军空军歼击部队赠送苏加诺总统一架喷气式歼击机模型。总统接受了赠礼以后对赵绍昌政委说：谢谢你们，我相信你们的空军将一天天发展。
    在总统离开机场以前，刘亚楼上将把最早从国民党空军中起义过来的刘善本大校介绍同总统相见。
