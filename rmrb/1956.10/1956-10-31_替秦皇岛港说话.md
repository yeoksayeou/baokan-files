Speaking Up for Qinhuangdao Port
By our correspondent Fan Rongkang

Before arriving at Qinhuangdao Port, I didn't fully understand what kind of port it was. This isn't just my personal ignorance as a reporter. Yang Ziyu, the Deputy Director of the Qinhuangdao Port Authority, told me that many people indeed don't understand Qinhuangdao Port. Tangshan and Jinzhou are close enough to Qinhuangdao, but when the Port Authority's Commercial Section held cargo owner meetings in Tangshan and Jinzhou, some people said, "A few small wooden boats floating around at sea, we won't consign our goods to them."

In reality, Qinhuangdao Port is a natural deep-water port with a large handling capacity. Compared to other major seaports in China, it has some unique advantages. Although Shanghai Port is large, it has the Tongsha shoal outside, and 10,000-ton ships need to wait for the tide to enter and exit, which always delays them by four to twelve hours each time. Although Tianjin New Port is a newly built giant port, it suffers from siltation, and 10,000-ton ships have to anchor outside the port and lighter some cargo to reduce their draft before entering. Qinhuangdao Port has deep water, and 10,000-ton ships can dock at the wharves at any time and can navigate in all seasons.

Qinhuangdao Port has a relatively complete set of port facilities. It has more than 40 kilometers of railway lines, its own marshalling yard, more than 170 railcars, its own steam locomotives, and the only electric locomotives among the major ports in China. The railway lines extend directly to seven wharves of various sizes; among them, wharves 5, 6, and 7 can accommodate 10,000-ton ships. Goods can be loaded directly from railcars onto ships, and unloaded from ships onto railcars. The port area has a considerable number of warehouses, storage yards, as well as water plants, power plants, mechanical repair shops, docks, dredgers, pilot boats, and other facilities.

The highest annual throughput in the history of Qinhuangdao Port reached 4.57 million tons, but in recent years, it has suffered from insufficient assignments. In 1953, the Ministry of Communications assigned an annual planned target of only 600,000 tons. In July of that year, the Port Authority preliminarily assessed the cargo sources and requested an increase to 1 million tons, but the Ministry of Communications still stuck to 600,000 tons (the actual completion was 1.25 million tons). In the past two years, the assignments have increased year by year, but Qinhuangdao Port is still underutilized, and the phenomenon of ships waiting for cargo is very serious. Since the beginning of this year, major ports across the country have been experiencing congestion, with Dalian Port and Tianjin New Port frequently crowded with ships and piled high with cargo, unable to turn around. Only Qinhuangdao Port is a quiet port, with more than 30% of working hours in each month from January to September having no work to do.

Due to small assignments and limited funding, many of the port's facilities lack money for repairs and use. The electric locomotive and three rail-mounted cranes were sealed up, a batch of lathes in the mechanical repair shop were sealed and another batch were transferred away, and one small dredger was kept while a larger one was sent away. These, at least, had some sort of handling. Only the wharves and railways, which could neither be sealed nor transferred to others, and had no money for maintenance, were left to be exposed to the sun and rain. Over time, the wharves and railways were damaged due to disrepair. Finally, the railway, with its long mileage, came up with a solution of "robbing Peter to pay Paul": when one track was damaged, the rails from another track were dismantled to repair it. As for the wharves, they were at a loss, and could only watch as the cracks in the reinforced concrete structure grew longer and the bulging areas increased day by day. Since 1954, with larger assignments and more funding, this "suicide policy" was stopped, but the scars it left have not yet healed.

Small assignments and low quotas made the handling of surplus personnel a major problem. In the early days of government administration, Qinhuangdao Port had more than 6,000 employees, but according to the assignments, the quota required only more than 2,900 people. Therefore, stevedores were transferred out in groups and teams, some to forestry departments, some to mines, and some were mobilized to return to their hometowns. In this way, more than 2,000 people were handled in the past few years. The remaining hundreds of people had nowhere to be transferred, so they formed a construction team, under the banner of "supporting basic construction," contracting engineering tasks outside. There was also a group of weak people, who were also reluctantly organized into a "production team" to help with light work. There were originally not many engineering and technical personnel. The entire Qinhuangdao Port Authority originally had six engineers, two of whom were transferred away. The remaining four were all elderly, with an average age of 61.5 years this year. The engineers are experienced and enthusiastic, and can cultivate new forces. However, young engineering and technical personnel are as rare as phoenix feathers; after much effort, only three university students and three high school students came this summer, and the technical force is facing a gap, and technical work cannot be carried out effectively.

Why is Qinhuangdao Port so "unlucky"? Is it that some leading agency or leader holds a bias? Of course not. Then, is it that the Qinhuangdao Port Authority is not working hard enough, not striving for success, and has been eliminated? That's not the case either. Although the work of the Qinhuangdao Port Authority has shortcomings, especially in the technical work which has not been given enough attention, in general, their work is relatively thorough. This has also been "forced" upon them. Government management came late, there were many bad practices, and management was backward, forcing them to reform and learn humbly from advanced ports. In recent years, they have been striving to "catch up"; now they indeed have some appearance of "surpassing those who came before." In terms of efficiency, it is the highest among all ports in the country, and in terms of cost, it is also relatively low.

So, where is the problem? The problem lies in how the transportation and materials departments understand rationalization of transportation.

From the perspective of the port's hinterland, Qinhuangdao Port has certain limitations. It lies between the Northeast and North China. The Northeast uses Dalian as its maritime gateway, and North China has Tianjin as its water transportation hub. Qinhuangdao Port is sandwiched between these two major seaports, its hinterland is narrow, and its development prospects are naturally not as good as Dalian Port and Tianjin Port. However, despite this, behind Qinhuangdao Port, there is still a large area of land in western Northeast, eastern Inner Mongolia, and northern North China. Two of the five major coal mines in the country, Kailuan and Fuxin, are located in this area. From the perspective of rational transportation routes, it is most suitable for the import and export of materials from this area to use Qinhuangdao Port. Qinhuangdao Port also has a good foundation, so Qinhuangdao Port still has certain development prospects.

From the perspective of the current situation of the three ports of Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, and Dalian, although Dalian Port and Tianjin Port still have considerable potential, they have been experiencing congestion in recent years, especially this year, the congestion has lasted longer. Many materials, when compared solely on the basis of the distance of each transportation route, are more economical and rational to go through Dalian Port and Tianjin Port than to go through Qinhuangdao Port. However, when all the materials are squeezed into Dalian Port and Tianjin Port, it causes congestion in these ports, prolongs the berthing time of ships, and is less economical and rational than going through Qinhuangdao Port. In particular, many ships are now running "triangular routes" between Shanghai, Dalian, and Qinhuangdao, that is, carrying cargo north from Shanghai, unloading cargo in Dalian, and then sailing empty to Qinhuangdao to carry cargo south. This "triangular route" on the one hand increases the burden on Dalian Port, resulting in a waste of ship capacity; on the other hand, it also causes a waste of railway capacity in Qinhuangdao Port. The Qinhuangdao railway station has therefore earned the nickname "empty train station," with about 90% of its railway vehicles returning empty from Qinhuangdao Port.

However, when using the three adjacent ports of Dalian, Tianjin, and Qinhuangdao, the transportation and materials departments often make choices solely and mechanically based on the distance of each cargo transportation route, without comprehensively considering the entire volume of transportation on the Bohai Sea route, combining the specific circumstances of the three ports, and making overall plans and rationally allocating assignments. In this situation, Qinhuangdao Port is limited by geographical conditions and cannot exert its strength.

Recently, the Ministry of Communications has paid attention to this issue. Starting from the fourth quarter, some of the iron ore originally transshipped through Dalian Port, which was shipped from Shanghai to Anshan Iron and Steel, has been rerouted through Qinhuangdao Port. This transportation route is beneficial to ensuring the raw material supply of Anshan Iron and Steel and solving the congestion of Dalian Port; in terms of freight costs, it is also cost-effective due to the reduction of empty return losses. However, there is still no complete agreement on how to use the three ports of Dalian, Tianjin, and Qinhuangdao, and especially what position Qinhuangdao Port should occupy. The Dalian Port Authority has objections to the rerouting of Anshan Iron and Steel's iron ore transportation, and the Tianjin Port Authority even believes that it is only reasonable for Kailuan coal to go through Tianjin Port.

These issues can certainly be further discussed, but from the overall interests of the national economy, how to save transportation capacity, save costs, and how to accelerate ship turnover and material turnover are urgent matters. For Qinhuangdao Port, what is urgently needed now is a comprehensive plan. However, comprehensive planning must first affirm whether Qinhuangdao Port has development prospects, and how much development prospects it has. This cannot be solved by the Qinhuangdao Port Authority itself. Recently, there have been more assignments, and the morale of the employees is very high, and positive factors in all aspects are active. But when it comes to the future, they are more or less confused again. What will happen in the future? No one can answer with certainty.

### 替秦皇岛港说话

    替秦皇岛港说话
    本报记者　范荣康
    来到秦皇岛港之前，我还不完全知道这是一个怎样的港口。这倒不是记者个人的孤陋寡闻。秦皇岛港务管理局杨子愚副局长告诉我，确实有许多人不了解秦皇岛港。唐山和锦州，算是离秦皇岛够近的了，可是港务局商务科在唐山和锦州开货主会议时，也有人说：“几条小木船在海上飘飘游游的，我们不托运。”
    其实，秦皇岛港是个吞吐能力很大的天然良港。它同国内各大海港相比，还有一些独到的好处。上海港虽大，但是外边有铜沙浅滩，万吨轮船需候潮进出，每次总要耽误四个小时到十二个小时；塘沽新港虽是新建的巨港，可是泥沙为害，回淤严重，万吨轮船要在港外抛锚，起驳一部分货物，减少吃水，才能进港；秦皇岛港的水很深，万吨轮船随时可以停靠码头，四季可以航行。
    秦皇岛港有一套比较全的港湾设备，这里有四十多公里的铁路线，有自己的调车场，有一百七十多辆车皮，有自己的蒸汽机车，有全国各大港口独一无二的电动机车。铁路线一直伸展到大小七个码头上去；其中五、六、七号码头可以停泊万吨轮船。货物可以直接由车装船，由船卸车。港区里有相当数量的仓库，货场，还有水厂、电厂、机械修配厂、船坞、挖泥船、引水船等各种设备。
    秦皇岛港历史上的最高年吞吐量曾经到过四百五十七万吨，可是这些年来，它却苦于任务不足。1953年，交通部发下的年度计划指标只有吞吐六十万吨的任务；这一年的7月，港务局初步摸了一下货源情况，要求追加任务到一百万吨，但交通部还是一个六十万吨（实际完成是一百二十五万吨）。近两年来任务虽然逐年增加，但秦皇岛港还是吃不饱，待船现象非常严重。今年以来，全国各大港口都在闹堵塞，大连港和塘沽新港都经常挤满了船，堆满了货，周转不开，唯有秦皇岛港是个清闲的港口，1月到9月，哪个月也有30％几的工时是没有活儿干的。
    任务小，经费少，港口上这么多的设备没有钱修理使用。电动机车和三台轨道式起重机都贴上了封条，机械修配厂的车床封了一批，调走了一批，两条挖泥船留下了一条小的，送走了一条大的。这些，都算好歹有了个处理。唯有码头和铁路，既不能用封条封起来，又不能调给别人用，更没有钱来维护；只得听任它日晒露淋，风吹雨打。久而久之，码头和铁路都因年久失修而受到损伤。最后，铁道总算仗着里程长，想出了一个挖肉补疮的办法：这股道坏了，把那股道的铁轨拆下来补上。至于码头，却是一筹莫展，只得眼看着钢筋混凝土结构上的裂缝一天比一天长，鼓起的地方一天比一天多。1954年以来，由于任务大了一些，经费多了一些，这种“自杀政策”停止了，但它所留下的疮伤，仍然没有治愈。
    任务小，定员少，编余人员的处理成了大问题。政府代管初期，秦皇岛港共有职工六千多人，根据任务算下来的定员只需两千九百多人。于是，装卸工人们整组、整队地往外调，有的被调到森林工业部门去，有的被调到矿山上去，有的被动员回乡。几年来，就这样处理了两千多人。剩下的几百人没有地方调，组成一支修建队，打着“支援基本建设”的旗帜，出外承包工程任务。还有一批体弱的，也勉强组织起来，算是一支“生产队”，帮着干些轻便活。工程技术人员本来不多，整个秦皇岛港务管理局原有六名工程师，调走了两名，剩下的四名都是老人，今年的平均年龄是六十一点五岁。工程师们都富有经验，热情很高，可以培养新生力量。无奈年轻的工程技术人员也如凤毛麟角；经过力争，今年暑期才来了大学生和高中学生各三名，技术力量是青黄不接，技术工作也施展不开。
    为什么秦皇岛港这样“不走运”呢？是哪个领导机关或者哪个领导人持有偏见吗？当然不是。那么，是不是秦皇岛港务管理局不努力，自己不争气，给淘汰下来了？也不是。秦皇岛港务管理局的工作虽然有缺点，特别是在技术工作上抓得很不够；但一般说来，他们的工作是比较深入的。这也是给“逼”出来的。政府管得晚，陋规多，管理落后，逼得他们改革，逼得他们虚心向先进港学习。这些年来，他们一直以“迎头赶上”自勉；现在确有几分“后来居上”的样子。论效率，它在全国各个港口是最高的，论成本，也是比较低的。
    那么，问题在那里呢？问题在交通部门和物资部门怎样来认识运输合理化。
    从港口腹地来看，秦皇岛港是有一定的局限性的。它界于东北和华北之间，东北持大连作海运门户，华北有天津为水上咽喉。秦皇岛港夹在这两大海港中间，腹地狭窄，发展前途自然比不上大连港和天津港。可是，尽管如此，在秦皇岛港的背后，毕竟还有东北西部，内蒙古东部和华北北部的一大块土地。全国五大煤矿就有开滦、阜新两大煤矿在这块土地上。这块土地上的物资进出，从合理的运输线路来看，舍秦皇岛港莫属；秦皇岛港又有良好的基础，因而秦皇岛港还是有一定的发展前途的。
    再从秦皇岛、天津、大连三个港目前的情况来看，大连港和天津港虽然也还有相当的潜力，但这些年来总要闹一阵堵塞，特别是今年，堵塞的时间更长。许多物资，孤立地从每一次运输线路的远近来比较，走大连港和天津港，是比走秦皇岛港经济、合理。可是，所有的物资都挤到大连港和天津港，造成这些港口堵塞，延长了船舶停泊时间，比起走秦皇岛港却是不经济、不合理的。特别是现在许多船只都在上海、大连、秦皇岛之间走“三角航线”，即由上海载货北上，到大连卸货，再空放到秦皇岛载货南下。这条“三角航线”，一方面加重了大连港的任务，造成了船舶运力的浪费；另一方面也造成了秦皇岛港铁路运力的浪费，秦皇岛铁路车站因此得了个“排空站”的外号，他们约有90％的铁路车辆是从秦皇岛港空驶回去的。
    可是，交通部门和物资部门在使用大连、天津和秦皇岛这三个毗邻的港口时，常常是孤立地，机械地从每一宗货物运输线路的远近来作取舍；而没有把整个北洋航线的运输量综合起来，结合这三个港口的具体情况，通盘规划，合理分配任务。在这种情况下，秦皇岛港受地理条件的限制，就使不上劲了。
    最近，交通部注意了这个问题，从第四季度起，原来经大连港中转的，由上海运往鞍钢的矿砂，已有一部分改由秦皇岛港中转。这条运输线路，对保证鞍钢的原料供应，解决大连港的堵塞，都是有利的；在运费方面，由于减少回空的损失，也还是合算的。但是，对于如何使用大连、天津和秦皇岛这三个港口，其中主要是秦皇岛港应该占个什么位置，在认识上还没有完全一致。大连港务管理局对鞍钢矿砂运输改道是有意见的，天津港务管理局甚至认为开滦煤只有走天津港才算是合理的。
    这些问题当然还可以进一步商榷，但从国民经济的整体利益出发，怎样才能节约运力、节约费用，怎样才能加速船舶周转，物资周转，却是刻不容缓的。对秦皇岛港说来，当前迫切需要的是一个全面规划。然而，全面规划，首先就要肯定秦皇岛港有没有发展前途，有多大的发展前途。这却不是秦皇岛港务管理局自己所能解决的。最近，任务多了一些，员工的情绪很高，各方面的积极因素都在活动。但谈到将来，多多少少又有些茫然，将来怎么样呢？还没有人能确有把握地回答出来。
