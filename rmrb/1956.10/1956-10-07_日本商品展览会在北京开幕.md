Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The Japanese Commodity Exhibition opened today at the Soviet Exhibition Center in Beijing.

    At 3:00 p.m., the opening ceremony was held in the square in front of the central hall of the Soviet Exhibition Center. More than 5,000 guests attended the opening ceremony. The entire square was newly decorated today. Sixteen Japanese and Chinese national flags fluttered in the wind on both sides of the square. Eighteen Japanese paintings of Mount Fuji, five-storied pagodas, and rising sun cranes were hung on both sides of the gatehouse. Water flowers sprayed from the lotus-style fountain. On both sides of the gate, there were two huge gold-lettered slogans: "Further develop economic and trade relations between China and Japan" and "Long live the friendship between the people of China and Japan."
    When the opening ceremony began, the band played the national anthems of Japan and China.
    Murata Shozo, Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, expressed his heartfelt and deep gratitude in his opening speech to the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people for their support and assistance in the preparation of the exhibition. He then said that the Japanese Commodity Exhibition held today, due to the limitations of Japan's international situation, is not sufficient to show the full picture of Japan's economic strength, which we feel very regretful about. Murata Shozo concluded by saying that we believe this exhibition will further deepen the friendship and trust between the people of Japan and China and become the foundation for the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China.
    Nan Hanchen said in his speech that the exhibition of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition marks a new atmosphere in the progress of Sino-Japanese trade, and Sino-Japanese trade will have greater development. Nan Hanchen said that we should join hands and work together to establish normal trade relations between China and Japan, to strive for the signing of a trade agreement between the two governments, the signing of a payment agreement between the banks of the two countries, and the mutual establishment of commercial representative offices.
    Ikeda Masanosuke, representative of the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade, representing various Japanese support groups, said that it is indeed a matter of rejoicing that the trade relations between Japan and China have overcome various difficulties and are developing steadily.
    After Sukeya Eiichi, the head of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition Delegation, reported on the preparations for the exhibition, he expressed the hope that this exhibition would contribute to the development of the economies of Japan and China, the expansion of trade volume between the two countries, and the promotion of friendly relations between the two countries.
    Ye Jizhuang, on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China, welcomed the opening of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition. He said that the Chinese government has always attached great importance to Sino-Japanese trade and has taken many positive measures to promote trade between the two countries. We believe that the artificial obstacles existing in Sino-Japanese trade relations will be eliminated sooner or later, and as long as we continue to work hard, the normalization of trade relations between the two countries will definitely be achieved.
    Guo Moruo, Li Dequan, and Liu Ningyi also delivered congratulatory speeches at the opening ceremony.
    When the congratulatory telegrams from Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and Ichiro Hatoyama, Prime Minister of the Japanese Cabinet, to the exhibition were read out at the meeting, warm applause broke out in the hall. The meeting also announced that the exhibition had received congratulatory telegrams from Tanzan Ishibashi, Minister of International Trade and Industry of Japan, Tatsunosuke Takasaki, Director-General of the Economic Planning Agency of Japan, Saburo Nango, Chairman of the Japan Export-Import Association, and various people's organizations and trade departments of China and Japan, as well as Korean trade organizations.
