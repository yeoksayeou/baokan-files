Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Guangdong and other provinces and cities open aquatic product markets; sources and varieties significantly increase, quality improves

    (Our newspaper reports) Since the opening of aquatic product markets in Jiangsu, Guangdong, Anhui, Beijing, Shanghai and other provinces and cities, the sources and varieties of goods have increased significantly, alleviating the previously tight supply of aquatic products.
    Shanghai mobilized fish vendors to go to the countryside to purchase fish from late August. Among the city's 205 vegetable markets, 132 markets have gone to Songjiang, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou prefectures, as well as Zhejiang and Anhui, to purchase goods. As a result, Shanghai's daily intake has reached more than 1,000 dan (excluding marine products), while before the market opened, the daily intake was only about 600 dan. In order to cooperate with Hebei Province's disaster relief work, the Beijing Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company has been handling consignment business since mid-September (only charging a 5% handling fee). At the same time, vendors are allowed to enter the city to peddle from door to door. The sales volume in the past month has reached 900,000 jin (of which consignment sales and free sales each account for half), accounting for 29% of the total sales of state-owned companies. The variety has also increased compared to when state-owned companies had a monopoly. The aquatic product market in Jiangsu Province has been fully opened. The task of state-owned companies is to lead and manage the market and supply markets far from the production areas. In order to ensure the supply to large cities and the needs of exports, Guangdong Province has signed supply and marketing contracts with fishery cooperatives in major fishing ports and major production areas according to national plans. General small fishing ports are completely open, and state-owned supply and marketing institutions in these areas have withdrawn. Markets in sales areas close to the production areas are fully open, while sales areas far from the production areas are supplied by state-owned companies. The aquatic products in Anhui Province were originally freely traded, and the market has become more active after the announcement of the opening of the market.
    After the opening of the aquatic product market, the purchase price and sales price have risen in general areas. For example, the state purchase price of variegated carp and silver carp in Changshu, Jiangsu, is 24.5 yuan per dan, while Shanghai merchants purchase them at 35 yuan per dan, which is 44% higher than the state price; the retail price has also risen accordingly. The state-owned retail price of fresh pointed fish in Dianbai County, Guangdong, is 0.204 yuan per jin, while the fishermen's self-sale price is 0.352 yuan, which is 72% higher. State-owned companies feel that the market is difficult to lead. Therefore, shortly after the opening, Shanghai decided that state-owned companies should control the main varieties (black carp, grass carp, variegated carp and white fish). All these fish transported by merchants are purchased by the aquatic product company at the state price, while other minor varieties are allowed to be freely transported and sold.
    Another problem after the opening of the aquatic product market is that the consolidation of fishery production cooperatives and fishery marketing cooperative stores (or groups) has been affected. Fishermen find it more convenient and profitable to produce and sell their own products or merchants to purchase and sell their own products than the centralized management of fishery cooperatives or cooperative stores. Therefore, they are generally unwilling to organize, and those who have already organized are mostly in name only. In Tanliu Village, Meiliang Township, Wu Chuan County, Guangdong Province, 19 of the original 33 fisherman households have withdrawn from the fishery cooperative. Some fishery cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives (sideline production departments) in Anhui Province have set up their own outlets in towns to sell their products.
    Aquatic products are fresh goods, so they need to be transported and sold quickly. In the past, state-owned companies had too many operating links, so the costs were high and the quality was poor. After the market opened, fish vendors were flexible in their operations and the quality was also good (the sales price of merchants in Beijing is about 10% cheaper than the state-owned price), which exposed many shortcomings in the operation and management of state-owned companies.

    北京、上海、江苏、广东等省市开放水产市场
    货源、品种显著增加质量提高
    本报讯　江苏、广东、安徽、北京、上海等省、市水产市场开放以来，货源和品种有显著增加，缓和了过去水产品供应紧张的情况。
    上海市从8月下旬动员鱼贩下乡采购，全市二百零五个菜市场，已有一百三十二个市场分别到松江、苏州、镇江、扬州专区以及浙江、安徽等地采购，由此上海全市每天进货量达到一千多担（不包括海产品），而在市场开放之前，每天进货量只有六百担左右。北京市水产供销公司为配合河北省救灾工作，自九月中旬办理代销业务（只收取5％的手续费），同时允许商贩进城串胡同贩卖，一个月来的销货量达到九十万斤
  （其中代销与自由推销者各占一半），为国营公司总销售额的29％，品种也较国营公司独家经营时增多。江苏省水产市场已全部开放，国营公司的任务是领导和管理市场以及对远离产地的市场进行供应。广东省为保证对大城市的供应和出口的需要，除在主要鱼港和主要产区，按照国家计划与渔业社订立供销合同外，一般小鱼港完全开放，这些地区的国营供销机构已经撤出；对距产地近的销区市场全部开放，距产地较远的销地则由国营公司负责供应。安徽省的水产品原来即为自由交易，宣布开放市场后更趋活跃。
    水产市场开放以后，收购价和销售价，在一般地区都有上涨。例如，江苏常熟的花鱼、白鲢鱼，国家收购牌价为每担二十四元五角，上海商贩则以每担三十五元收购，高出国家牌价44％；零售价也随之上升。广东电白县鲜尖鱼国营零售价为每斤二角零四厘，而渔民自销价为三角五分二厘，高出72％。国营公司感到市场难于领导。上海市因此在开放后不久，又决定由国营公司掌握主要品种（青鱼、草鱼、花鱼和白鱼），凡商贩运来的这些鱼，一律按国家牌价由水产公司收购，其他次要品种则允许自由贩运。
    水产市场开放后的另一个问题，是渔业生产合作社和渔业推销合作商店（或小组）的巩固受到了影响。渔民自产自销或商贩自购自销较渔业社或合作商店集中经营来得方便，而且获利大，因此一般都不愿意组织起来，已组织起来的也多徒有其名。广东省吴川县美良乡谭流村渔业合作社原有渔民三十三户，现在已有十九户退出了渔业合作社。安徽省有部分渔业社和农业社（副业生产部门）自己在城镇设立门市部推销产品。
    水产品是一种鲜货，因此需要快运快卖。过去国营公司由于经营的环节过多，所以费用大，质量不好；市场开放后，渔贩经营灵活，质量也好。（北京市商贩销货价较国营价格便宜10％左右），这暴露了国营公司在经营管理工作上存在着很多缺点。　　（林晰）
