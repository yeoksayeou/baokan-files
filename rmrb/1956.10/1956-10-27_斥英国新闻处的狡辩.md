    Refuting the Sophistry of the British Information Office

    The British Information Office, a British official body, published a commentary on the Kowloon riot on October 23. This commentary shows how the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong, in order to protect the Kuomintang secret agents who created the Kowloon riot, are grasping at ridiculous arguments out of desperation.

    The author of the British Information Office's commentary apparently believes that his main task is to exonerate the Kuomintang secret agents, because in doing so, he can also exonerate the British government and the Hong Kong authorities. Therefore, although the British government says that it is "too early" to draw conclusions about the Kowloon riot, its official organ, the Information Office, is not afraid to contradict itself and has drawn a "conclusion" on this incident. This conclusion is: "During the riots, supporters of the Communists and the Kuomintang undoubtedly clashed, but most of the damage was caused by a group of ruffians and looters."

    Predictably, this "conclusion" of the British Information Office will also be the "not too early" conclusion that the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities will make. The purpose of drawing this conclusion is to portray the Kowloon riot as a "conflict" between the Communists and the Kuomintang, rather than being planned and carried out single-handedly by Kuomintang secret agents. Moreover, the Kuomintang secret agents' acts of murder and arson are easily shifted onto the "group of ruffians and looters." In this way, the British Information Office seems to be able to effortlessly invite the Kuomintang secret agents from the defendant's seat to the witness stand, and put white gloves on their blood-stained hands.

    However, the reports from the international press, especially the Chinese press, about the truth of the Kowloon riot are an obstacle to the British Information Office's manipulation. These reports, based on irrefutable facts, point out that the Kuomintang secret agents were the direct organizers of this riot. Now, "The Times" of London also believes in its October 23 editorial that "all the evidence does indicate that the Kowloon riots were planned by the Kuomintang secret service." The British Information Office's attempt to replace facts with sophistry, and to completely shirk responsibility for the Kuomintang secret agents and the Hong Kong British authorities, is completely futile.

    The British Information Office denies that the Hong Kong authorities are protecting the Kuomintang secret agents, and describes the fact that Hong Kong is a center of Kuomintang secret agents' conspiracies as a "fabrication." But it also tries its best to speak for the Kuomintang secret agents, trying to prove that "Beijing's accusation that Kuomintang secret agents launched the riots is untenable," and for this purpose, it puts forward a laughable argument. It says, "If the Kuomintang is in fact making large-scale use of Hong Kong territory to achieve its own purposes, then it would be the last thing it would want to do to launch a riot in certain circumstances where it knew that the riots would force the Hong Kong government to take immediate drastic measures."

    It is interesting that the British Information Office considers itself qualified to express the thoughts of the Kuomintang secret agents. But whether the Kuomintang secret agents "knew" that their riots "would force the Hong Kong government to take immediate drastic measures" is highly questionable. What exactly do the Kuomintang secret agents have to fear from the Hong Kong authorities taking "immediate drastic measures"? This is not the first time they have committed murder and arson in Hong Kong. Which time has the Hong Kong authorities "immediately taken" "drastic measures" against them? Didn't the murderers who sabotaged the "Kashmir Princess" plane escape leisurely from under the nose of the Hong Kong authorities?

    It is precisely the Hong Kong British authorities' consistent connivance and protection of the Kuomintang secret agents that has made these secret agents increasingly emboldened and lawless. And the course of the Kowloon riot also proves that the Hong Kong British authorities did not "immediately take drastic measures" at the beginning of the riot, but instead allowed the Kuomintang secret agents to run amok.

    The British authorities may again shout that this accusation is "Communist propaganda," or they may even lodge a protest. Well, then, let's listen to what those British people who are definitely not Communists are saying. Arthur Vere Harvey, a member of the British Conservative Party, said in the British House of Commons that he had "some unease" about the British authorities' "slow suppression of the riots." A reporter from "The Economist" magazine in Hong Kong reported that "at the beginning of the Kowloon riots, the actions of the Hong Kong government authorities were clumsy. By the evening, the situation was out of control, and troops were not sent until the afternoon of the next day."

    It was with such "drastic measures" that the Hong Kong British authorities provided the Kuomintang secret agents with, in the words of the British Information Office, "opportunities for them to indulge in their favorite pastimes." What the British government is now afraid of is that the fact that the Hong Kong authorities are condoning the Kuomintang secret agents' doing whatever they want will be exposed; therefore, it wants to protest against the so-called accusations of the Chinese government and the press, and therefore, the British Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd insists that Harvey's accusations are "unreasonable."

    The British Information Office cannot produce the fact that the Hong Kong authorities "immediately took drastic measures" against the Kowloon riot. Without this fact, all sophistry to exonerate the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities, as well as the Kuomintang secret agents, is just meaningless nonsense. However, the British Information Office also wants to bite China back, saying that China accuses the Hong Kong British authorities because it "sees an opportunity to divert people's attention from certain more important, thorny and embarrassing problems inside China, such as the economic and transportation situation." This is probably the original intention of the British government's slander that China is using the Kowloon riot to seek "political capital."

    The Chinese people and those who understand the current situation in China will definitely sneer at this absurd slander of the British Information Office. The Chinese government, people, and press are exposing some problems, errors, and shortcomings that still exist in the country's work every day. We do not need any "political capital" to divert attention from these problems. It is not others who are using the Kowloon riot to seek "political capital," but the British government itself. This sophistry of the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities, to put it bluntly, is not just to find an excuse for them to continue to condone and protect the Kuomintang secret agents?

    Those gentlemen in the British Information Office should be told that your sophistry cannot stand up to the facts. Now is not the time for sophistry, but the time to face the facts. If the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities do not change their connivance and protection of the Kuomintang secret agents, they will surely eat the bitter fruit they have sown.

### 斥英国新闻处的狡辩

    斥英国新闻处的狡辩
    英国官方的英国新闻处在10月23日发表了一篇关于九龙暴乱事件的评论。这篇评论使人看出英国政府和香港英国当局为了庇护制造九龙暴乱事件的国民党特务分子，正在怎样饥不择食地寻找可笑的论据。
    英国新闻处的评论作者显然认为：给国民党特务分子开脱责任是他的主要任务，因为这样也就可以给英国政府和香港当局开脱了责任。因此，虽然英国政府说现在要对九龙暴乱事件下结论还“为时过早”，可是它的官方机关新闻处却不怕自相矛盾，给这次事件下了“结论”。这个结论就是：“在骚乱期间，共产党和国民党的支持者毫无疑问发生了冲突，但是，大多数损害是由一批无赖和抢劫者造成的。”
    可以预料，英国新闻处这个“结论”，也就是英国政府和香港英国当局将要作出的“为时不早”的结论。作出这个结论的目的，是想把九龙暴乱事件说成是共产党和国民党之间的“冲突”，而不是国民党特务分子一手有计划制造的。而且国民党特务分子的杀人放火的行为，也被轻而易举地转嫁到“一批无赖和抢劫者”头上。这样，英国新闻处似乎就可以不费力气地把国民党特务分子从被告席请到了证人席，给他们的染满了血污的手戴上了白手套。
    但是，各国新闻界特别是中国新闻界关于九龙暴乱事件的真相的报道，却是英国新闻处玩弄这个手法的障碍。这些报道都根据无可辩驳的事实，指出国民党特务分子是这次暴乱的直接组织者。现在伦敦“泰晤士报”在10月23日的社论里也认为：“所有的证据确实说明，九龙的骚乱是国民党特务机关所策划的”。英国新闻处企图用狡辩来代替事实，给国民党特务分子和香港英国当局把责任推卸个干干净净，这完全是徒然的。
    英国新闻处否认香港当局庇护国民党特务分子，把香港是国民党特务分子的阴谋中心这个事实说成是“捏造”。但是它又竭力要替国民党特务分子说话，想证明“北京提出的关于国民党特务分子发动骚动的指责是站不住脚的”，并且为此提出了一个令人发笑的论据。它说，“如果国民党事实上在大规模地利用香港领土来达到自己的目的，那么在知悉骚动将会迫使香港政府马上采取严峻措施的某些情况下面发动骚动，将是它最不愿意做的事。”
    英国新闻处自认为有资格代表国民党特务分子来表达他们的想法，这一点很有意思。但是国民党特务分子是不是“知悉”他们的骚动“将会迫使香港政府马上采取严峻措施”，这却大有研究余地。国民党特务分子究竟凭什么要害怕香港当局“马上采取严峻措施”呢？他们在香港杀人放火已经不是第一次，哪一回香港当局对他们“马上采取”过“严峻措施”？破坏“克什米尔公主号”飞机的凶手，不就是从香港当局的鼻子底下从容不迫地逃走的吗？
    正是香港英国当局对国民党特务分子一贯的纵容包庇，使得这些特务分子越来越胆大妄为，无法无天。而九龙暴乱事件的经过也证明，香港英国当局并没有在暴乱一开始的时候就“马上采取严峻措施”，反而是纵容国民党特务分子胡作非为。
    英国当局对于这种指责也许又要叫嚷说这是“共产党的宣传”，也许还要提抗议。那末，好吧，听听那些决不是共产党人的英国人是怎么说的吧。英国保守党的议员阿瑟·维·哈维在英国下院说，他对于英国当局“慢吞吞地镇压暴乱”存在着“一些不安”。英国“经济学家”杂志在香港的记者报道说，“在九龙骚乱开始的时候，香港政府当局的行动是笨拙的。到了晚上形势已经不能控制，直到第二天下午才开去了部队。”
    香港英国当局就是用这样的“严峻措施”，给国民党特务分子提供了，用英国新闻处的话来说，“他们纵情做他们所喜欢的消遣的机会”。英国政府现在害怕的就是香港当局这种纵容国民党特务分子为所欲为的事实被揭露出来；因此它要对中国政府和新闻界的指责提出所谓抗议，因此英国殖民大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德硬要说哈维的指责是“没有道理的”。
    英国新闻处拿不出香港当局对九龙暴乱事件“马上采取严峻措施”的事实来。没有这个事实，一切替英国政府和香港英国当局以及国民党特务分子开脱责任的狡辩，就都只是无聊的废话。然而英国新闻处还想反咬中国一口，说什么中国指责香港英国当局是因为“看到机会来转移人们对中国内部像经济和运输情况等某些更加重要、棘手和难堪的问题的注意”。这大概也就是英国政府诽谤中国利用九龙暴乱事件寻找“政治资本”的本意。
    中国人民和了解中国现状的人一定会对英国新闻处的这种荒诞无稽的诽谤嗤之以鼻。中国政府、人民和新闻界天天在揭露国家工作中还存在的一些问题、错误和缺点，我们不需要转移对这些问题的注意的什么“政治资本”。利用九龙暴乱事件来寻求“政治资本”的不是别人，正是英国政府自己。英国政府和香港英国当局的这种狡辩，说穿了，不就是为他们能继续纵容和庇护国民党特务分子寻找借口吗？
    应当告诉英国新闻处的那些先生们，你们的狡辩是敌不过事实的。现在不是狡辩的时候而是正视事实的时候。英国政府和香港英国当局如果不改变对国民党特务分子的纵容和包庇，它们就一定会吃到自己种下的苦果。
