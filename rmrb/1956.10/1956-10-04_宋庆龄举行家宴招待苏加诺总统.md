Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Madame Soong Ching Ling, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, hosted a family banquet tonight in honor of President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia.

Also invited were senior officials accompanying President Sukarno on his visit to China, Indonesian women representatives, and the Indonesian Ambassador to China, Wiyopo Pranoto.

Among those present to accompany the guests were Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice-Premier Chen Yi, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian, and the Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia, Huang Zhen, among others.

When President Sukarno arrived, Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling greeted President Sukarno in her garden courtyard and invited him to visit her grape vines. Bunches of ripe red grapes hung all over the grape trellis. President Sukarno picked some grapes himself, eating them and praising them as very good.

Next, Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling invited the guests to dine in the living room. In this elegant living room, President Sukarno saw a very familiar and beautiful Indonesian painting. This painting used to hang on the walls of his presidential palace. This year, when Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling visited Indonesia as a guest, the President gave the painting to Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling as a gift. In the living room there was also an enlarged photograph of President Sukarno, which the President had also given to Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling when she was a guest in Indonesia.

Here, Sukarno also paid his respects to the portrait of the great Chinese revolutionary, Mr. Sun Yat-sen.

The family banquet was very lively, and President Sukarno and Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling spoke fluently in English throughout.

As the family banquet was coming to an end, the hosts and guests took a group photo together. President Sukarno was very happy. First, he sang a song with the other Indonesian guests to wish Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling longevity, and then he sang a song of the Indonesian revolution.

After the pleasant family banquet, Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling and Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen accompanied President Sukarno on a visit to the Wangfujing Department Store.
