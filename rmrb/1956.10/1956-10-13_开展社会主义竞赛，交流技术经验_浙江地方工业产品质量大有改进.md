Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, October 11th: Zhejiang's local industrial product quality has significantly improved. According to statistical data and market feedback, the quality of three-quarters of the province's main local industrial products has basically stabilized or is improving month by month. Among these, the quality of glazed tiles, silk fabrics, suede leather, mimeograph stencils, cement, bricks, caffeine citrate, rice threshers and other products has reached a relatively advanced level. The glazed tiles produced by the Xishan Ceramics Factory have already received orders from fourteen countries in the international market. The leather shoes produced in Wenzhou not only solved problems such as cracked surfaces, but also improved the styles, increasing the variety to more than 180 types. These leather shoes have changed from products that were once stockpiled to products that are in short supply.

Since the first quarter, 26 industries, more than 1,000 factories and mines, and over 100,000 employees in Zhejiang Province have participated in various forms of socialist emulation drives. After the Ningbo textile system launched the emulation campaign, 75% of the city's weavers eliminated substandard products. After silk factories throughout the province exchanged technical experience with silk factories in Shanghai, Jiangsu and other places, the first-class silk rate increased from 44% to 98%.

    开展社会主义竞赛，交流技术经验
    浙江地方工业产品质量大有改进
    新华社杭州11日电　浙江地方工业产品质量有显著改进和提高。根据统计材料和市场反映，全省地方工业有四分之三的主要产品的质量已经基本上稳定下来，或者在逐月提高。其中釉面砖、绸缎、绒面革、打字腊纸、水泥、砖、钻石咖啡因、打稻机等产品的质量，已经达到比较先进水平。西山陶瓷厂出产的釉面砖目前在国际市场上已经得到十四个国家的订货。温州市的皮鞋不但解决了裂面等问题，而且改进了式样，品种增加到一百八十多种。这些皮鞋已由过去一度积压而变为供不应求的产品了。
    浙江省从第一季度以来，有二十六个行业、一千多个厂矿、十万以上职工参加了各种形式的社会主义竞赛。宁波市纺织系统在开展竞赛运动以后，全市有75％的织布工人消灭了次货。全省缫丝厂与上海、江苏等地丝厂交流技术经验以后，丝的正品率已由44％提高到98％。
