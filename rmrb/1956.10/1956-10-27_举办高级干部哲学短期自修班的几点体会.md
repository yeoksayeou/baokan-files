Some Experiences in Running a Short-Term Philosophy Self-Study Class for Senior Cadres
Hu Shaoming

    According to the central government's plan for senior cadres to study theory, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee decided that, in addition to sending some cadres to the Central Senior Party School in batches, the remaining cadres would be concentrated for self-study for three to four months each term. The Shanghai Senior Cadre Philosophy Self-Study Class has held two sessions, concentrating a total of 83 cadres, including deputy mayors, department and bureau chiefs, district party secretaries, district heads, university presidents, and large factory directors. Most of these comrades have a junior high school education or higher and have a certain reading ability. They have also read some theoretical books, but they are still unfamiliar with philosophy. A few have some basic knowledge, but none have undergone systematic study. The study plan for these two sessions basically followed the Central Senior Party School's study syllabus and the principle of systematic and focused study as instructed by the Central Propaganda Department. The main learning method was self-study. Before each session, specific arrangements were made, stipulating which major issues should be understood, which boundaries should be clarified, and which major and reference materials should be read. During each topic's study, several review and reflection questions were raised in connection with reality, first prepared separately by each person, and then discussed and supplemented in group meetings. In terms of classes, each major unit organized three to four systematic lectures, introducing the content of major classic works. In addition, experts were invited to give special reports on natural sciences to help them read classic works. Comrades who participated in the study unanimously believed that this method of concentrating on studying one course for three to four months each term was more effective than the previous method of studying for half a day each week.

    Through study, everyone has a clear understanding of the importance of studying philosophy. For example, some comrades said: "I didn't care about philosophy at all in the past, but now I know that only by studying philosophy can I fundamentally overcome subjectivism"; "In the past, I made mistakes in my work, and although I made self-criticisms, my understanding was not profound enough. The reason is that I didn't consider the problem from the perspective of world outlook and methodology, so I couldn't find the root cause of the shortcomings." The more common reflection is that after studying philosophy, reading Party documents and instructions is more profound than before, and reading Comrade Mao Zedong's works is more intimate and flavorful, further realizing that it is not only possible but also necessary for veteran cadres to study philosophy.

    Based on the practice of these two training classes, we have the following experiences in the method of short-term intensive study for senior cadres:

    First, we must proceed from reality, put forward different learning requirements for students with different levels, and adopt different learning methods, instead of demanding uniformity and applying the same approach to everyone. Learning methods should vary from person to person. Generally, comrades can follow the procedures stipulated in the Central Senior Party School's study syllabus. Comrades with higher levels can choose several classic works for in-depth study. Those with lower levels and difficulty in reading classic works can read less, or read some second-hand materials first, and then read classic works. In this way, they can start from the easy and move to the difficult, from the shallow to the deep, and achieve the same goal through different paths. We believe that learning methods also need to be flexible according to the characteristics of senior cadres, and the principle of voluntariness should be implemented. For example, attending lectures and receiving guidance reports can be voluntary. Comrades with higher levels and independent self-study ability can choose not to participate. As for comrades who are in poor health or prefer to study alone, they do not necessarily have to concentrate on self-study, but can study separately or in groups. Those who wish to commute can commute. Even for comrades who are concentrated for study, if they are in poor health, they do not necessarily have to study for eight hours, and the time can be adjusted appropriately by themselves. However, the unified schedule of the entire self-study class is still necessary and welcomed by everyone.

    Second, participants in this philosophy self-study class are all veteran cadres with a long revolutionary history, considerable struggle experience, and a certain degree of Party spirit training. Subjectively, they all understand the need to support materialism and oppose idealism. At the same time, all categories and principles of Marxist philosophy have something in common with the Party's policies and everyone's practical experience, which is a favorable condition for them to study philosophy. However, on the other hand, most comrades are still unfamiliar with philosophy, have little basic knowledge of natural science, and have many habitual empiricist viewpoints in their thinking style. The entire study time is only more than three months, which is a difficult condition. Based on the above situation, our requirements for veteran cadres to study philosophy must start from the foundation of their existing perceptual knowledge and adopt a systematic and focused learning method. The key points we have established are roughly as follows: First, the fundamental question of dialectical materialism; Second, the content of the main categories and principles in philosophy; Third, to draw a clear line between dialectical materialism and idealism and mechanical materialism; Fourth, to focus on clarifying the dialectical materialist theory of knowledge, the "On Contradiction," and the role of the people and individuals in history. As for certain philosophical categories and concepts that are not easy to understand at once, they can be left for further study and supplementary lessons during on-the-job learning in the future.

    Third, we believe that veteran cadres' study of philosophy should be different from general theoretical research. Veteran cadres' study of philosophy should focus on solving the problems of world outlook and methodology, and connect the Marxist philosophical principles they have learned with their own work. Therefore, in terms of learning content, we believe that in addition to reading those required classic works, such as "Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy" and certain chapters of "Anti-Dühring," we should focus on reading Comrade Mao Zedong's works, because many of Comrade Mao Zedong's works are models of creatively applying dialectical materialism to solve the practical problems of the Chinese revolution. They are easy to combine with their revolutionary practice and experience, help them to digest and accept, and have more realistic guiding significance for practical work, resulting in greater learning effectiveness.

    Fourth, when grasping the principle of linking theory with practice, because veteran cadres have rich revolutionary experience, and they are also eager to apply theory to solve problems in their actual work, there is no need to worry about whether they are willing to link with reality. The key is how to inspire them to connect with reality purposefully and step by step. In the early stage of learning, we should emphasize reading carefully, thinking independently, and mastering basic principles. As philosophical knowledge increases, we should constantly expand the scope of connection. For example, in these two sessions, when studying "Knowledge Comes from Practice," they connected it with the problem of opposing dogmatism; when studying "Rational Knowledge Depends on Perceptual Knowledge," they connected it with the issue of investigation and research; when studying "Perceptual Knowledge Needs to Be Elevated to Rational Knowledge" and "Rational Knowledge Must Return to Practice Again," they connected it with class analysis, comprehensive planning, experience summarization, and leadership methods. When studying "On Contradiction," they can connect it with learning the spirit and method of analyzing contradictions in Comrade Mao Zedong's article "On Protracted War," and they can also connect it with Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," learning Comrade Mao Zedong's method of finding contradictions, studying contradictions, and solving contradictions. When studying historical materialism, they can connect it with "On the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship," etc., to overcome subjectivism, bureaucracy, and dogmatism in practical work.

    When connecting with reality, we must also prevent the situation of citing examples casually and applying theories indiscriminately. Connecting with reality should have a center, that is, it should revolve around a certain period or a major policy issue. For example, in the first session, we centered on the spirit and method of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong opposing right-leaning conservative thinking and promoting the high tide of socialist revolution. In the second session, we centered on "On the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship" and opposing one-sidedness in ideological methods. When connecting with these issues, if it goes too far or delves into complex issues that are temporarily beyond our ability to solve, it is necessary to control it appropriately. Doing so is not only conducive to systematically mastering philosophical theory, but also beneficial to continuing to use Marxist philosophical principles to solve practical problems in future practical work. As for connecting with ideological methods and work styles that exist in individual practical work, they can be carried out consciously, and it is best not to stipulate them rigidly.

    Finally, I would like to talk about the issue of tutoring work. The focus of tutoring work should be on how to inspire everyone to think independently. However, we have not done enough in this area. First of all, regarding the issue of lectures, lectures as a kind of tutoring are needed by senior cadres, but there are many questions worth studying about how to lecture to suit such a group of students. The most prominent issues are the method of lecturing and connecting with reality. According to everyone's feedback, the most popular are the introduction of the content of classic works and special reports on natural sciences, because these reports are indeed of great help to their studies. In terms of lecturing methods, they requested enlightening reports, first helping them to draw an outline, and focusing on key issues by combining them with their difficult problems to make necessary explanations to clarify concepts and grasp the essence. They can also introduce the issues currently debated in academic circles and their different opinions, which helps them to think independently. Generally speaking, they do not welcome the lecturing method of explaining each question and sentence. In terms of connecting with reality, they also require guidance and enlightenment, rather than simply listing a large number of examples, because they can also give such examples.

    Of course, due to the lack of lecturing experience of theoretical teachers with this group of students, and due to the limitations of theoretical level, it is currently practically difficult to solve this problem perfectly. This is only put forward as a direction of effort.

    In terms of organizing discussions, group discussions are also necessary, but should not be too frequent. The discussion method can be more lively, with two or three people freely talking together, or organizing casual talks during some spare time, or individual talks can be arranged. The group can also organize discussions based on the problems or questions raised in the talks. The tutoring office can also print and distribute the problems and disputed opinions that existed in the last semester to everyone, or it can promptly introduce the problems debated by one group to other groups. If it is found that there are some common problems, large group discussions can also be organized when necessary. It is not necessary to draw conclusions after the discussion, and it can be left for further development in the future. This group discussion method is useful for senior cadres' learning, because they have a certain understanding ability, which can be used to infer other things from one instance, inspire each other, and make up for the lack of independent thinking.

    举办高级干部哲学短期自修班的几点体会
    胡少鸣
    根据中央规定的高级干部学习理论的计划，上海市委确定除一部分分批送中央高级党校学习外，分批每期脱产三、四个月集中自修。上海高级干部哲学自修班已先后举办了两期，共集中了副市长、部局长、区委书记、区长、高等学校校长、大型工厂厂长等干部八十三人进行学习。其中大多数同志的文化程度在初中以上，有一定的阅读能力，多少也读过一些理论书籍，但对哲学这一门课程还是很生疏的，少数人虽稍有基础，也从没有经过系统的学习。这两期的学习计划基本上按照中央高级党校学习大纲和中央宣传部所指示的系统重点的学习原则进行的，学习方法主要是自修。在每一期学习之前，都进行了具体布置，规定要搞通那几个主要问题；划清那几个界限；阅读那些主要材料和参考材料。在每题学习过程中，又联系实际提出了若干复习思考题，先由各人分别准备，再在小组会上讨论补充。在上课方面，每一大单元组织三次到四次系统讲授，对主要的经典著作作了内容介绍，此外，还请人作了自然科学方面的专题报告，以帮助他们阅读经典著作。参加学习的同志一致认为这种每期抽出三、四个月时间集中学习一门课程的方法，较之过去每周学习半天的方式收效更大。
    通过学习，大家对学习哲学的重要性已有了明确的认识。如有的同志说：“我对哲学过去是根本不关心的，现在知道只有学习哲学才能从根本上克服主观主义”；“过去在工作中犯错误，虽然也作了检讨，但认识总是不深刻，原因就是没有从世界观方面和方法论来考虑问题，因此也就找不到缺点的根源。”较普遍的反映认为学了哲学以后，再看党的文件指示已较前深刻，读毛泽东同志著作也更加亲切有味了，从而进一步感到老干部学哲学，不仅可以学，而且必须学。
    根据这两期训练班的实践，我们对高级干部短期集中学习的方法方面有下面一些体会：
    第一，必须从实际出发，要根据学员不同的水平，提出不同的学习要求，采用不同的学习方法，而不要强求一致，千篇一律。学习方法应该因人而异，一般同志可按照中央高级党校学习大纲规定的程序进行学习，水平较高的同志可自行选择几本经典著作进行钻研，水平较低阅读经典著作有困难的可以少读，或者先读一些第二手材料，然后再读经典著作，这样先易后难，由浅入深，可以达到异途同归的目的。我们认为根据高级干部的特点，学习方式上也需要灵活，贯彻执行自愿原则。如上课作辅导报告等可自愿参加，水平较高有独立自修能力的同志可以不参加，至于身体不好或愿意单独学习的同志也不一定硬要他们集中自学，可以分散学或几个人集合一齐学，愿意走读的可以走读，即使集中学习的同志如果因身体不好也不一定硬要学习八小时，时间可以由自己适当调剂，但整个自修班的统一作息时间还是必要的，也是为大家所欢迎的。
    第二，参加这个哲学自修班的，都是老干部，他们有相当长的革命历史，有不少的斗争经验和一定的党性锻练，主观上也都懂得要拥护唯物主义反对唯心主义的，同时马克思主义哲学所有范畴、原理与党的方针政策及大家的实际经验有相通的地方，这对他们学习哲学是有利条件；但另一方面，大多数同志对哲学还是生疏的，自然科学的基础知识很少，思想作风上也有许多习以为常的经验主义观点，而整个学习时间只有三个多月，这是困难条件。根据以上的情况，我们对老干部学习哲学的要求，就必须从他们已有的感性知识的基础出发，采取系统重点的学习的办法。我们确立的重点大概是这样几个：一，辩证唯物主义根本问题；二，哲学中主要范畴和原理的内容；三，划清辩证唯物主义与唯心主义及机械唯物主义的界限；四，着重搞清辩证唯物主义认识论、“矛盾论”以及人民群众和个人在历史上的作用等问题。至于某些一时不易搞通的哲学范畴和概念，可以留在以后在职学习时再去作进一步的研究和补课。
    第三，我们认为老干部学哲学应该与一般的理论研究有所区别，老干部学哲学应该着重解决世界观和方法论的问题，使他们学到的马克思主义哲学原理与本身的工作联系起来。为此，在学习内容方面，我们认为除了阅读那些必读经典著作，如“费尔巴哈与德国古典哲学的终结”“反杜林论”等某些章节外，应该着重阅读毛泽东同志的著作，因为毛泽东同志的许多著作是创造性的运用辩证唯物主义解决中国革命实际问题的典范，易于同他们革命的实践和体验结合起来，有助于他们消化和接受，对实际工作也更有现实的指导意义，学习成效也就更大。
    第四，在掌握理论联系实际的方针时，因为老干部有丰富的革命经验，而且他们也迫切需要应用理论来解决自己实际工作中的问题，因此不必担心他们愿意不愿意联系实际。关键还是在如何启发他们有目的、有步骤地联系实际。在学习初期，应该强调认真读书，独立思考，掌握基本原理，随着哲学知识的增加来不断地扩大联系面。例如在这两期学习中，学习“认识从实践中来”时，他们就联系到反对教条主义的问题；学习“理性认识依赖于感性认识”时，就联系到调查研究的问题；学习“感性认识又待于上升到理性认识”、“理性认识还须再回到实际”时，就联系到阶级分析，全面规划，经验总结和领导方法等问题。学习“矛盾论”，可以联系学习毛泽东同志在“论持久战”一文中分析矛盾的一个完整过程的精神和方法，也可以联系毛泽东同志
  “关于农业合作化问题”的报告，学习毛泽东同志寻找矛盾，研究矛盾，解决矛盾的方法。学习历史唯物主义时，可以联系“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”等等，以克服实际工作中的主观主义、官僚主义、教条主义。
    在联系实际时，也要防止随便举例，硬搬乱套的情况。联系实际就要有中心，即是要围绕着一定时期，或某个重大政策问题来进行，如第一期我们以党中央和毛泽东同志反对右倾保守主义思想，促进社会主义革命高潮的精神和方法为中心；第二期我们以“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”以及反对思想方法上的片面性为中心。联系这些问题时，如果扯得太远了或钻进了暂时无力解决的复杂问题时，就需要适当控制。这样做，不但有利于系统地掌握哲学理论，而且对今后在实际工作中继续运用马克思主义哲学原理解决实际问题也是有好处的。至于联系个人在实际工作中所存在的思想方法、工作作风等问题可以由他们自觉地去进行，最好不要硬性规定。
    最后，我想谈谈关于辅导工作问题。辅导工作的重点应该放在如何启发大家独立思考上面。但这一方面的工作我们是做得很不够的。首先关于讲课的问题，讲课作为一种辅导是高级干部所需要的，但究竟应该怎样讲才能适合这样一批学员，这里就有很多问题值得研究。其中最突出的问题，是讲课的方法和联系实际的问题。根据大家的反映，最受欢迎的是经典著作的内容介绍和自然科学的专题报告，因为这些报告对他们学习确实有很大的帮助。在讲课方法上，他们要求做启发性的报告，首先帮助他们画一个轮廓，重点问题可以结合他们的疑难问题作些必要的解释，以明确概念，掌握精神实质，也可以介绍目前在学术界中所争论的问题和他们的分歧意见；有助于他们独立思考。一般说，他们并不欢迎逐题逐句的讲课方法。在联系实际方面，他们也要求诱导和启发，而不要泛泛地举上一大堆例子，因为这样的例子他们也举得出的。
    当然，由于理论教员缺乏对这部分学员的讲课经验；由于理论水平的限制，目前美满地解决这个问题是有实际困难的，这里只是作为努力方向提出。
    在组织讨论方面，小组讨论也是必要的，但不宜过多。讨论方式可以活泼些，二、三个人在一起自由交谈，或利用一些空余的时间组织漫谈，也可个别交谈。小组还可以根据交谈中所产生的问题或提出的问题来组织讨论，辅导室也可以把上学期所存在的问题和争论的意见印发给大家，也可以及时地把某一小组所争论的问题介绍给其他小组，发现有些带有共同性问题在必要时也可以组织大组讨论，讨论后不一定要作出结论，可以留在以后继续展开。这种小组讨论方式，对高级干部学习来说是有用的，因为他们有一定的理解能力，这样可以触类旁通，互相启发，以弥补独立思考之不足。
