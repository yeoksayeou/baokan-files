Some Experiences in Running a Short-Term Philosophy Self-Study Class for Senior Cadres
Hu Shaoming

    According to the central government's plan for senior cadres to study theory, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee decided that, in addition to sending some cadres to the Central Senior Party School in batches, the remaining cadres would be concentrated for self-study for three to four months each term. The Shanghai Senior Cadre Philosophy Self-Study Class has held two sessions, concentrating a total of 83 cadres, including deputy mayors, department and bureau chiefs, district party secretaries, district heads, university presidents, and large factory directors. Most of these comrades have a junior high school education or higher and have a certain reading ability. They have also read some theoretical books, but they are still unfamiliar with philosophy. A few have some basic knowledge, but none have undergone systematic study. The study plan for these two sessions basically followed the Central Senior Party School's study syllabus and the principle of systematic and focused study as instructed by the Central Propaganda Department. The main learning method was self-study. Before each session, specific arrangements were made, stipulating which major issues should be understood, which boundaries should be clarified, and which major and reference materials should be read. During each topic's study, several review and reflection questions were raised in connection with reality, first prepared separately by each person, and then discussed and supplemented in group meetings. In terms of classes, each major unit organized three to four systematic lectures, introducing the content of major classic works. In addition, experts were invited to give special reports on natural sciences to help them read classic works. Comrades who participated in the study unanimously believed that this method of concentrating on studying one course for three to four months each term was more effective than the previous method of studying for half a day each week.

    Through study, everyone has a clear understanding of the importance of studying philosophy. For example, some comrades said: "I didn't care about philosophy at all in the past, but now I know that only by studying philosophy can I fundamentally overcome subjectivism"; "In the past, I made mistakes in my work, and although I made self-criticisms, my understanding was not profound enough. The reason is that I didn't consider the problem from the perspective of world outlook and methodology, so I couldn't find the root cause of the shortcomings." The more common reflection is that after studying philosophy, reading Party documents and instructions is more profound than before, and reading Comrade Mao Zedong's works is more intimate and flavorful, further realizing that it is not only possible but also necessary for veteran cadres to study philosophy.

    Based on the practice of these two training classes, we have the following experiences in the method of short-term intensive study for senior cadres:

    First, we must proceed from reality, put forward different learning requirements for students with different levels, and adopt different learning methods, instead of demanding uniformity and applying the same approach to everyone. Learning methods should vary from person to person. Generally, comrades can follow the procedures stipulated in the Central Senior Party School's study syllabus. Comrades with higher levels can choose several classic works for in-depth study. Those with lower levels and difficulty in reading classic works can read less, or read some second-hand materials first, and then read classic works. In this way, they can start from the easy and move to the difficult, from the shallow to the deep, and achieve the same goal through different paths. We believe that learning methods also need to be flexible according to the characteristics of senior cadres, and the principle of voluntariness should be implemented. For example, attending lectures and receiving guidance reports can be voluntary. Comrades with higher levels and independent self-study ability can choose not to participate. As for comrades who are in poor health or prefer to study alone, they do not necessarily have to concentrate on self-study, but can study separately or in groups. Those who wish to commute can commute. Even for comrades who are concentrated for study, if they are in poor health, they do not necessarily have to study for eight hours, and the time can be adjusted appropriately by themselves. However, the unified schedule of the entire self-study class is still necessary and welcomed by everyone.

    Second, participants in this philosophy self-study class are all veteran cadres with a long revolutionary history, considerable struggle experience, and a certain degree of Party spirit training. Subjectively, they all understand the need to support materialism and oppose idealism. At the same time, all categories and principles of Marxist philosophy have something in common with the Party's policies and everyone's practical experience, which is a favorable condition for them to study philosophy. However, on the other hand, most comrades are still unfamiliar with philosophy, have little basic knowledge of natural science, and have many habitual empiricist viewpoints in their thinking style. The entire study time is only more than three months, which is a difficult condition. Based on the above situation, our requirements for veteran cadres to study philosophy must start from the foundation of their existing perceptual knowledge and adopt a systematic and focused learning method. The key points we have established are roughly as follows: First, the fundamental question of dialectical materialism; Second, the content of the main categories and principles in philosophy; Third, to draw a clear line between dialectical materialism and idealism and mechanical materialism; Fourth, to focus on clarifying the dialectical materialist theory of knowledge, the "On Contradiction," and the role of the people and individuals in history. As for certain philosophical categories and concepts that are not easy to understand at once, they can be left for further study and supplementary lessons during on-the-job learning in the future.

    Third, we believe that veteran cadres' study of philosophy should be different from general theoretical research. Veteran cadres' study of philosophy should focus on solving the problems of world outlook and methodology, and connect the Marxist philosophical principles they have learned with their own work. Therefore, in terms of learning content, we believe that in addition to reading those required classic works, such as "Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy" and certain chapters of "Anti-DÃ¼hring," we should focus on reading Comrade Mao Zedong's works, because many of Comrade Mao Zedong's works are models of creatively applying dialectical materialism to solve the practical problems of the Chinese revolution. They are easy to combine with their revolutionary practice and experience, help them to digest and accept, and have more realistic guiding significance for practical work, resulting in greater learning effectiveness.

    Fourth, when grasping the principle of linking theory with practice, because veteran cadres have rich revolutionary experience, and they are also eager to apply theory to solve problems in their actual work, there is no need to worry about whether they are willing to link with reality. The key is how to inspire them to connect with reality purposefully and step by step. In the early stage of learning, we should emphasize reading carefully, thinking independently, and mastering basic principles. As philosophical knowledge increases, we should constantly expand the scope of connection. For example, in these two sessions, when studying "Knowledge Comes from Practice," they connected it with the problem of opposing dogmatism; when studying "Rational Knowledge Depends on Perceptual Knowledge," they connected it with the issue of investigation and research; when studying "Perceptual Knowledge Needs to Be Elevated to Rational Knowledge" and "Rational Knowledge Must Return to Practice Again," they connected it with class analysis, comprehensive planning, experience summarization, and leadership methods. When studying "On Contradiction," they can connect it with learning the spirit and method of analyzing contradictions in Comrade Mao Zedong's article "On Protracted War," and they can also connect it with Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," learning Comrade Mao Zedong's method of finding contradictions, studying contradictions, and solving contradictions. When studying historical materialism, they can connect it with "On the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship," etc., to overcome subjectivism, bureaucracy, and dogmatism in practical work.

    When connecting with reality, we must also prevent the situation of citing examples casually and applying theories indiscriminately. Connecting with reality should have a center, that is, it should revolve around a certain period or a major policy issue. For example, in the first session, we centered on the spirit and method of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong opposing right-leaning conservative thinking and promoting the high tide of socialist revolution. In the second session, we centered on "On the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship" and opposing one-sidedness in ideological methods. When connecting with these issues, if it goes too far or delves into complex issues that are temporarily beyond our ability to solve, it is necessary to control it appropriately. Doing so is not only conducive to systematically mastering philosophical theory, but also beneficial to continuing to use Marxist philosophical principles to solve practical problems in future practical work. As for connecting with ideological methods and work styles that exist in individual practical work, they can be carried out consciously, and it is best not to stipulate them rigidly.

    Finally, I would like to talk about the issue of tutoring work. The focus of tutoring work should be on how to inspire everyone to think independently. However, we have not done enough in this area. First of all, regarding the issue of lectures, lectures as a kind of tutoring are needed by senior cadres, but there are many questions worth studying about how to lecture to suit such a group of students. The most prominent issues are the method of lecturing and connecting with reality. According to everyone's feedback, the most popular are the introduction of the content of classic works and special reports on natural sciences, because these reports are indeed of great help to their studies. In terms of lecturing methods, they requested enlightening reports, first helping them to draw an outline, and focusing on key issues by combining them with their difficult problems to make necessary explanations to clarify concepts and grasp the essence. They can also introduce the issues currently debated in academic circles and their different opinions, which helps them to think independently. Generally speaking, they do not welcome the lecturing method of explaining each question and sentence. In terms of connecting with reality, they also require guidance and enlightenment, rather than simply listing a large number of examples, because they can also give such examples.

    Of course, due to the lack of lecturing experience of theoretical teachers with this group of students, and due to the limitations of theoretical level, it is currently practically difficult to solve this problem perfectly. This is only put forward as a direction of effort.

    In terms of organizing discussions, group discussions are also necessary, but should not be too frequent. The discussion method can be more lively, with two or three people freely talking together, or organizing casual talks during some spare time, or individual talks can be arranged. The group can also organize discussions based on the problems or questions raised in the talks. The tutoring office can also print and distribute the problems and disputed opinions that existed in the last semester to everyone, or it can promptly introduce the problems debated by one group to other groups. If it is found that there are some common problems, large group discussions can also be organized when necessary. It is not necessary to draw conclusions after the discussion, and it can be left for further development in the future. This group discussion method is useful for senior cadres' learning, because they have a certain understanding ability, which can be used to infer other things from one instance, inspire each other, and make up for the lack of independent thinking.
