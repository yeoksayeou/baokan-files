    Shanghai Actively Prepares to Commemorate Lu Xun
    [Our Dispatch] Shanghai is working intensely to prepare for activities commemorating the 20th anniversary of Lu Xun's death. Lu Xun's new tomb, new memorial hall, and documentary film about his life will all be completed on schedule. The enlargement of the statue has also been completed. The new memorial hall is much richer in content than the original. In addition to enriching the content about Lu Xun's childhood and his studies in Nanjing and Japan, it has also added some newly discovered documents. These include a strategic map of the Fourth Front Army of the Red Army during the Long March, drawn by General Chen Geng when he met with Lu Xun in Shanghai, as well as materials treasured by Soviet and Vietnamese friends.
    Literary and art workers are enthusiastically participating in various activities commemorating Lu Xun. Shanghai artists have created forty or fifty oil paintings, traditional Chinese paintings, watercolors, woodcuts, and other works related to the commemoration. Filmmakers have traveled to Lu Xun's birthplace and places where he worked, such as Shaoxing, Beijing, Hangzhou, and Guangzhou, to shoot exterior scenes. Young sculptors are working intensely on processing and reproducing the statue. The various groups of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Writers Association's Creation Committee have all launched various thematic seminars and discussions according to the original plan. In October, writers will give reports to literary and art workers, workers, students, cadres, and citizens throughout the city.
    Many writers and artists who had contact with Lu Xun are writing memoirs about him. Shen Yinmo, Huang Yuan, Yu Ling, Chen Yanqiao, Wu Langxi, and others have already completed their pieces. The September issue of "Wenyi Yuebao" (Literary Monthly) published memoirs by Yu Ling, Wu Langxi, Wang Baoliang, and others. These will be of considerable help in better studying and learning from Lu Xun. The October special commemorative issue of "Wenyi Yuebao" will be entirely devoted to publishing papers, thematic studies, memoirs, and artistic creations related to the commemoration of Lu Xun. Other newspapers and periodicals will also provide a certain amount of space. (Tian Ming)

    上海积极筹备纪念鲁迅
    本报讯　上海正在紧张地筹备着纪念鲁迅逝世二十周年的活动。鲁迅先生的新墓、新纪念馆和鲁迅生平纪录片都可以如期完成。雕像的放大工作也完成了。新的纪念馆比原纪念馆内容丰富得多，除鲁迅的少年时期、在南京和日本读书时期的内容都较前充实外，并增加了一些新发现的文件，像陈赓将军到上海和鲁迅先生会见时所画的长征中红四方面军转战略图，还有苏联、越南友人所珍藏的一些材料。
    文艺工作者热情横溢地参加了纪念鲁迅的各种活动。上海的美术家们创作了有关纪念的油画、国画、水彩画、木刻等作品四、五十件。电影工作者分别到绍兴、北京、杭州、广州等鲁迅的生地和工作地点拍摄外景。年青的雕刻家们正紧张地对雕像进行加工和翻制工作。中国作家协会上海分会创作委员会各组都已按照原定计划，展开了各种专题的座谈讨论。十月份作家们分别向全市的文艺工作者、工人、学生、干部、市民等做报告。
    很多与鲁迅先生有过接触的作家、艺术家，正在写有关鲁迅先生的回忆。沈尹默、黄源、于伶、陈烟桥、吴朗西等已经写好。九月号“文艺月报”发表了于伶、吴朗西、王宝良等的回忆。对更好地研究鲁迅、学习鲁迅将有不少帮助。十月份“文艺月报”纪念鲁迅特大号将以全部篇幅刊登有关纪念鲁迅的论文、专题研究、回忆文章和美术创作。其他各报刊也将提供一定篇幅。　（天明）
