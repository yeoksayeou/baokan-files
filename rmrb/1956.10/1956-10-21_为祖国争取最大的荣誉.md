    Strive for the Greatest Honor for the Motherland

    The selection competitions for the 16th Olympic Games have concluded. The representatives of the seven events selected for Melbourne through this selection competition have showcased the skills and achievements of our country's athletes.

    In this selection competition, some good athletic achievements have emerged, indicating that the level of sports in our country is in a stage of continuous improvement and moving towards the international level. In the weightlifting selection competition, except for the light heavyweight class where no one participated, the total scores of the remaining six classes broke all of last year's national records, and fifteen individual national records were broken, some of which have reached or exceeded the level of the top six in the previous Olympic Games. Such as the world record holder for the snatch in the flyweight class, Chen Jingkai, and the total scores of lightweight athletes Huang Qianghui, etc. In the shooting competition, Zhang Zhiming's 100-meter running deer standing position shooting and 25 double-shot running deer targets were close to the first place in the previous Olympic Games. In the new event of men's small-bore rifle prone shooting at a distance of 50 meters with 60 shots, Zhao Shanjun's score of 595 rings (out of a full 600 rings) was also very excellent. In track and field, although the score of women's discus thrower Shi Baozhu in this selection competition was 70 centimeters less than the 49.04 meters she created in August this year, maintaining a score of around 48 meters is relatively stable. The young swimmer Mu Xiangxiong's time in the 200-meter breaststroke was 2 minutes 38.9 seconds this time. If he can once again achieve his personal best of 2 minutes 36 seconds this year, he may enter the top three in this Olympic Games. These situations indicate that our athletes may still achieve some victories in this international competition.

    From this selection competition, we can see the vigorous development of sports in our country in recent years and the gradual improvement of athletic levels. For example, gymnastics is still a relatively new sport in our country. Now, many male and female athletes can complete the all-around event, and some athletes can better complete the compulsory exercises of the Olympic Games; and they incorporate some beautiful and highly difficult movements from Chinese martial arts into the floor exercise. The women's rhythmic group exercise is also participating in international competitions for the first time. If the athletes can skillfully master the fan dance movements, it will be a wonderful program. Although the weightlifting athletes' scores did not all break through or reach their personal bests this year, they are generally relatively stable. Some new athletes have also emerged in the shooting selection competition. There are still relatively many athletes participating in the two ball sports selection competitions, and they have made great progress in personal skills and mutual cooperation, especially the speed and jumping ability of basketball players have improved significantly.

    From this selection competition, we can also see some shortcomings or deficiencies. For example, our gymnasts are not accurate enough when completing the compulsory exercises of the Olympic Games, some connecting movements are not skilled enough, and are not steady; weightlifting athletes' snatch is generally lower than the clean and jerk, and some athletes cannot grasp the center of gravity of their bodies well after lifting the barbell, resulting in no total score; most basketball players do not pay enough attention to defensive skills, and the shooting percentage from mid-range is not very high. These all show that the athletes' daily training is not good enough and their skills are not skilled enough.

    It should be admitted that the achievements of most of our sports are still far behind the world level. In this track and field selection competition, although 46 people broke 21 national records of 1955, in the thirteen field events for men and women, only three items—men's javelin, pole vault, and women's discus—have just reached the entry standard for this Olympic Games. In all sprint events for men and women, none have reached the top six scores of the previous Olympic Games. Although gymnastics has made great progress in recent years, it is still far from the requirements. In the Olympic gymnastics competition, to win the top six places in each event, it is necessary to perform the compulsory exercises with great confidence and accurately complete the optional exercises with sufficient extreme difficulty, and both need to reach a score of 9.67 or higher. This will be a severe test for our young gymnasts.

    In this selection competition, some athletes failed to maintain their original scores. Some were because they were nervous on the spot and could not fully exert their skills; some were because they did not pay attention to preventing colds and had poor physical conditions; some were because they did not grasp the training plan well and the warm-up activities before the competition were not appropriate. In response to these shortcomings, it is further required that athletes be trained in multiple competitions, pay attention to consolidating existing achievements from all aspects, and strive to create higher records.

    Athletes! On the eve of participating in the Olympic Games, make another effort, show courage and tenacious fighting spirit in the upcoming intense competition, strive to create new records for the motherland, and strive for the greatest honor.

    为祖国争取最大的荣誉

    参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会的各项选拔赛已经结束了。通过这次选拔赛选出去墨尔本的七个项目的代表队，检阅了我国运动员的技术和成绩。
    在这次选拔赛中，出现了一些良好的运动成绩，说明我国体育运动水平，正处在日益提高并向国际水平迈进的阶段中。举重选拔赛，除次重量级没人参加以外，其余六个级总成绩的去年全国最高纪录全部被刷新，十五个单项的全国纪录被打破，其中有的已经达到或超过上届奥林匹克运动会前六名的水平。如最轻量级双手挺举世界最高纪录保持者陈镜开和轻量级运动员黄强辉的总成绩等。在射击比赛中，张志明的跑鹿一百公尺立姿射击，二十五双发跑鹿靶都接近了上届奥林匹克运动会第一名的成绩。在新项目男子小口径步枪卧射五十公尺距离六十发射击中，赵善俊取得的五百九十五环（满环是六百环）的成绩，都是非常优异的。田径赛中，女子铁饼运动员石宝珠，这次选拔赛的成绩虽然比今年8月创造的四十九公尺零四的成绩少了七十公分，但保持四十八公尺左右的成绩是比较巩固的。年轻的游泳选手穆祥雄的二百公尺蛙泳的成绩这次是二分三十八秒九，如果能够再一次出现二分三十六秒的个人今年最高纪录，在这一届奥林匹克运动会的比赛中就有可能进入前三名。这些情况说明，我国运动员在这一次国际比赛上还是有可能取得一些胜利的。
    从这次选拔赛中，可以看到我国近几年来体育运动的蓬勃开展和运动水平的逐渐提高。例如体操运动，在我国还是一个较新的项目。现在已有很多男女运动员能完成全能项目，而且有些运动员能够较好地完成奥林匹克运动会的规定动作；并且把我国武术中一些优美的、难度较高的动作揉合在自由体操中。女子轻器械团体操还是第一次参加国际比赛，如果运动员们能够熟练地掌握扇子操的动作，它将是一个精彩的节目。举重运动员的成绩这一次虽然没有全部突破或达到个人今年最高纪录，但是一般还比较巩固。射击选拔赛中也涌现了一些新运动员。参加两项球类选拔赛的运动员还是比较多的，他们在个人技术和相互配合等方面都有很大进步，特别是篮球运动员的速度和弹跳力有了显著的进步。
    从这次选拔赛中，也看出一些缺点或不足的地方。例如，我们的体操运动员在完成奥林匹克运动会的规定动作时还不够准确，一些连接的动作还不太熟练，不稳健；举重运动员的抓举普遍低于推举，有些运动员在杠铃举起后不能很好掌握身体重心，因而没有总成绩；多数篮球运动员还不大重视防守技术，中距离投篮的命中率也不很高。这些都说明运动员的日常锻练还不够好，技术还不够熟练。
    应当承认，我国绝大多数运动项目的成绩还远远地落后于世界水平。在这次田径选拔赛中，虽然也有四十六人打破了二十一项1955年的全国纪录，但是在男子和女子的十三个田赛项目中，还只有男子标枪、撑竿跳高和女子铁饼三项刚刚达到本届奥林匹克运动会的入选标准。在男子和女子的全部径赛项目中，还没有一项能够达到上届奥林匹克运动会各项第六名的成绩。体操运动近年来虽然有了很大的进步，但是距离要求还很远。在奥林匹克运动会的体操比赛中，要争得各个项目前六名的名次，就必须十分有把握地作好规定动作和准确地完成具有足够的极高难度的自选动作，并且都需要分别达到九点六七以上的分数。这对我国的年轻的体操运动员，将是一次严重的考验。
    在这次选拔赛中，有一些运动员没有能保持原有的成绩。有的是因为临场紧张，技术不能充分发挥；有的是因为没有注意防止伤风感冒，身体情况不好；有的是因为练习计划掌握不好，比赛前准备活动作的不适当。针对这些缺点，就进一步要求运动员在多次比赛中进行锻练，从各方面注意巩固已有的成绩，并争取创造更高的纪录。
    运动员们！在参加奥林匹克运动会的前夕，再努一把力，在即将到来的激烈竞赛中拿出勇敢、顽强的战斗精神，争取为祖国创造新纪录，争取最大的荣誉。
