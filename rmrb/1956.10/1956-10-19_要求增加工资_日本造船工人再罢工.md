    Demanding Wage Increases
    Japanese Shipyard Workers Strike Again
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th -- Approximately 50,000 shipyard workers from nine Japanese shipbuilding companies began their third indefinite strike this morning.

    To demand that management increase workers' wages by 2,000 yen per month, Japanese shipyard workers held two strikes on October 8th and 12th, but management indicated that they were only willing to increase wages by 400 or 500 yen. Therefore, the workers continue to strike.
