    Soviet State Farms Overfulfill Grain Delivery Plan
    This Year is the Highest Cotton Production Year in Soviet History
    (By our Moscow correspondent, October 28) Soviet state farms have overfulfilled the grain delivery plan. This year, state farms across the Soviet Union delivered a total of 900.6 million poods of grain to the state, mainly wheat, exceeding the state-set plan by 150 million poods, which is 3.6 times more than the grain delivered by state farms before the uncultivated wasteland was reclaimed in 1953. Among them, state farms in the Kazakh Republic delivered 515.9 million poods of grain to the state, fulfilling 124% of the plan; state farms in the Russian Federal Republic delivered 353.5 million poods of grain, fulfilling 133% of the plan. The reason state farms overfulfilled the grain delivery plan is that a large amount of new land has been reclaimed. Currently, state farms have reclaimed a total of 13.7 million hectares of land, increasing this year's grain sown area to 23 million hectares. As a result of the large-scale reclamation of new land, many regions in Kazakhstan, Siberia, and the Volga River basin have become huge grain production bases. Between 1954 and 1955, 425 grain state farms were established in the eastern region of the Soviet Union. In 1956, they delivered a total of 500.5 million poods, which is 1.6 times more than the grain delivered by all Soviet state farms before the uncultivated wasteland was reclaimed in 1953. Many farms delivered more than 3 million poods of grain. Due to the increase in the amount of marketable grain and the reduction in costs, a large portion of the state's investment in establishing these farms has already been repaid. Currently, all state farm staff are working hard to complete the delivery of agricultural products such as cotton, sugar beets, potatoes, vegetables, milk, and meat to the state, and to prepare for next year's cultivation.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 28th: According to TASS, bountiful harvest news is coming from all over the Soviet Union this autumn. The grain harvest in many regions is unexpectedly abundant. As of October 10, the amount of grain sold to the state by various regions was one-half more than in the same period last year. The areas reclaimed in the last three years alone have sold about 1.5 billion poods of grain to the state. In early October, the Kokchetav Oblast of the Kazakh Republic sold 165 million poods of grain, which is twelve times the amount in 1953.
    This year is the highest cotton production year in Soviet history. As of October 21, collective farms and state farms had sold 626,500 tons more cotton to the state than in the same period last year. The cotton harvest in the Central Asian republics is bountiful, with more than 2.2 million tons of raw cotton harvested in Uzbekistan alone.
    Currently, 250 million quintals of sugar beets have been harvested in the fields of collective farms across the country, which is more than 50 million quintals more than in the same period last year. Kyrgyzstan has the highest sugar beet harvest, with an average yield of 320 quintals per hectare.

    苏联国营农场超额完成交粮计划
    今年是苏联历史上棉花产量最高的一年
    本报莫斯科28日电　苏联国营农场已经超额完成了谷物的上交计划。今年全苏联的国营农场一共交给国家九亿零六十万普特粮食，其中主要是小麦，比国家所规定的计划超出一亿五千万普特。比1953年未开垦荒地以前国营农场所交的粮食多三点六倍。其中哈萨克共和国国营农场交给国家五亿一千五百九十万普特粮食，完成计划的124％；俄罗斯联邦共和国国营农场交了三亿五千三百五十万普特粮食，完成计划133％。国营农场超额完成交粮计划的原因是开垦了大量新地，目前国营农场一共已开垦了一千三百七十万公顷土地，使今年谷物播种面积增加为二千三百万公顷。大量开垦新地的结果，使得哈萨克斯坦、西伯利亚和伏尔加河流域的许多区域变成为巨大的谷物生产基地。苏联东部地区在1954和1955年间一共建立了四百二十五个谷物国营农场，它们在1956年一共交了五亿零五百万普特，比1953年未开垦新地前全苏联国营农场所交的粮食还多一点六倍。其中许多农场交的粮食都达到三百万普特以上。由于大量商品粮食的增加和减低了成本，国家在建立这些农场时的投资的极大部分已经可以偿还。目前全体国营农场的工作人员正在为完成交给国家棉花、甜菜、马铃薯、蔬菜、牛奶、肉类等农产品及为准备明年的耕种而全力工作。
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：今年秋季，苏联到处传来丰收的消息。许多地区的谷物的收获量是出乎意料的丰稔。到10月10日为止，各地交售给国家的粮食比去年同一时期多二分之一。单是最近三年来开垦的地区就向国家交售了约十五亿普特谷物。10月上旬，哈萨克共和国科克契塔夫州交售了一亿六千五百万普特的粮食，这个数字为1953年的十二倍。
    今年是苏联历史上棉花产量最高的一年。到10月21日为止，集体农庄和国营农场交售给国家的棉花比去年同一时期多六十二万六千五百吨。中亚细亚各共和国的棉花都是丰收，单是在乌兹别克就收获了二百二十多万吨原棉。
    目前在各地集体农庄的田地上已经收获了二亿五千万公担甜菜，这比去年同一时期多五千多万公担。吉尔吉斯的甜菜收获量最高，那里的平均收获量是每公顷收获三百二十公担。
