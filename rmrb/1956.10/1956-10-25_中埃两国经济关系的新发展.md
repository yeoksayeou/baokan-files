New Developments in Sino-Egyptian Economic Relations
    Yaoting
    The Trade Delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China to Egypt signed the "Protocol on the Second Agreement Year of Trade Agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Egypt" and the "Payment Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Egypt" in Cairo on October 22, 1956. At the same time, after the successful conclusion of trade negotiations, both sides issued a press communiqué on the trade negotiations between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Egypt. This marks a new development in Sino-Egyptian economic relations.
    Since the signing of the Sino-Egyptian Trade Agreement and the Protocol on the First Agreement Year of the Sino-Egyptian Trade Agreement by the two governments on August 22, 1955, Sino-Egyptian trade has been developing on a broader path. In the past year, both sides have successfully implemented the Sino-Egyptian Trade Agreement and the Protocol on the First Annual Agreement of the Sino-Egyptian Trade Agreement. Thanks to the sincere efforts of both sides, Sino-Egyptian trade has greatly increased. From January to August 1956, China's imports from Egypt increased by about two times compared with the same period last year, and China's supply of materials to Egypt increased by more than twelve times compared with the same period last year. China imported more than 16,000 tons of cotton and more than 10,000 pieces of cotton yarn and other materials from Egypt. China has become the world's third largest buyer of Egyptian cotton. The Egyptian side has also imported many industrial products, food, agricultural, sideline, local and special products from China, such as steel, textile machines, caustic soda, sodium sulfide, silk, tea, frozen beef and mutton, and cottonseed oil. There is no doubt that the exchange of these materials is beneficial to the economies of both sides.
    In the past year, trade exchanges between China and Egypt have also become closer. After the trade delegation headed by Muhammad Abu Naseer, Minister of Industry and Commerce of the Egyptian Government, visited China and signed the first trade agreement in the history of the two countries, in March 1956, the trade delegation of the People's Republic of China headed by Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade of China, visited the Republic of Egypt for one month at the invitation of the Egyptian government and held talks on the development of trade relations between China and Egypt. During the visit, transactions worth four million pounds were reached. China purchased a large amount of Egyptian cotton yarn, and Egypt purchased Chinese steel, machinery, vegetable oil, etc. At the same time, China also held a commodity exhibition in Egypt to introduce the various aspects of China's economic construction to the Egyptian people. These friendly activities are of great significance for strengthening Sino-Egyptian economic cooperation and enhancing the friendship between the peoples of China and Egypt.
    In May 1956, the governments of China and Egypt established diplomatic relations and sent diplomatic representatives at the ambassadorial level to each other. This laid a more solid foundation for the consolidation and development of Sino-Egyptian economic relations.
    Due to the increasing development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Egypt, the two governments and peoples have a strong desire to further expand trade. This desire is fully reflected in the Second Protocol of the Sino-Egyptian Trade Agreement and the Payment Agreement. The new protocol stipulates that both parties agree to export 12 million pounds each, an increase of 20% over the amount stipulated in the previous year's protocol. The increase in trade volume clearly reflects the requirements of economic development on both sides. We believe that with the continuous development of friendly cooperation between China and Egypt, the trade volume stipulated in the new protocol will certainly be successfully realized. The payment agreement stipulates that the national banks of both parties shall open accounts and conduct regular settlement in currencies agreed upon by both parties. In the past, every transaction between China and Egypt was paid in pounds. After the Suez Canal incident, Britain unreasonably froze Egypt's pounds, and China and Egypt could not pay in pounds. The signing of the Sino-Egyptian Payment Agreement greatly facilitates direct payments between the two sides, thereby helping the further development of Sino-Egyptian trade relations.
    The holding of this trade talk between the governments of China and Egypt is precisely at the time when the Egyptian people are carrying out an anti-colonialist struggle for the nationalization of the Suez Canal. The negotiations also embodied the spirit of the Chinese people's firm support for the just struggle of the Egyptian people. As everyone knows, after the Egyptian government announced the decree to nationalize the Suez Canal, the United States, Britain, and France brutally exerted pressure on Egypt. They not only mobilized armed forces to threaten Egypt with force, but also did everything they could to try to economically strangle Egypt. They froze Egyptian property and funds in their countries, banned the export of important materials to Egypt, and so on. However, as the "People's Daily" editorial on July 30, 1956 pointed out: "Threats and intimidation are of no use to people who understand the meaning of 'Give me liberty, or give me death'." With the support of the people of the world, the Egyptian government and people united and took a series of corresponding measures, and extensively carried out trade with socialist countries and Asian and African countries, giving a powerful counterattack to the US, British, and French imperialists and achieving major victories. In order to support the just struggle of the Egyptian people, China provided Egypt with 20 million Swiss francs as advance payment for goods not long after Britain froze Egypt's pound deposits to help Egypt solve some foreign exchange difficulties. At the same time, in order to support Egypt, China continued to purchase Egypt's main export commodity, cotton, and also supplied Egypt with a large amount of cottonseed oil, frozen beef and mutton, tin, coke, caustic soda and other materials. These commodities can be booked first without paying foreign exchange, and then Egypt will pay with materials. Like China, the Soviet Union, India, and other socialist countries and Asian and African countries are providing strong economic support to Egypt. We firmly believe that with the strong support of the people of the world, the Egyptian people's anti-colonialist struggle will surely achieve a complete victory.
    The continuous development of Sino-Egyptian economic relations is due to the fact that it has always been based on equality, mutual benefit, and sincere cooperation. As Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his speech at the plenary session of the Asian-African Conference: "Our trade exchanges and economic cooperation with each other should be aimed at promoting the independent economic development of all countries, and should not make any party simply a source of raw materials and a sales market for consumer goods." It must be mentioned here that the continuous strengthening and development of Sino-Egyptian economic relations is the result of the joint efforts made by the governments and peoples of China and Egypt to implement the spirit of the Bandung Conference and realize the resolutions of the Bandung Conference on economic cooperation. Over the past year, many facts in the Asian and African regions have proved that countries that have implemented the above-mentioned resolutions have achieved good development in their foreign relations.
    China and Egypt also have very good conditions for economic complementarity. China can not only import a large amount of cotton from Egypt, but also purchase Egyptian cotton yarn and other products. China can export to Egypt machinery, paper, silk, tea, food, vegetable oil, and various daily necessities needed for Egypt's economic development and people's lives. In addition, many products such as coke, wheat, beef, and mutton are also needed by the Egyptian people. China can also and is willing to supply certain complete sets of industrial equipment according to Egypt's needs. There are also certain conditions for Sino-Egyptian technical cooperation. Egypt has many aspects in agricultural technology that are worth learning from us, and China is also willing to provide Egypt with its technical experience in production and construction.
    The Chinese people are greatly delighted by the further development of Sino-Egyptian economic relations. It can be asserted that this friendly and cooperative relationship will develop more rapidly on the existing basis. The continuous development of this friendly and cooperative relationship is entirely in the interests of the peoples of China and Egypt, and it will play an increasingly significant role in the cause of consolidating peace in Asia, Africa, and the world.

    中埃两国经济关系的新发展
    耀庭
    中华人民共和国政府赴埃及贸易代表团，于1956年10月22日在开罗和埃及共和国政府签订了“关于中华人民共和国政府和埃及共和国政府间的贸易协定第二个协定年度的议定书”和“中华人民共和国和埃及共和国间支付协定”，同时在贸易谈判圆满结束以后双方发表了中华人民共和国和埃及共和国贸易谈判公报。这标志着中埃两国经济关系的新发展。
    自从中埃两国政府1955年8月22日签订中埃贸易协定和中埃贸易协定第一个协定年度的议定书以来，中埃两国贸易就在更广阔的道路上发展着。在过去的一年中，双方圆满地执行了中埃贸易协定和中埃贸易协定第一个年度的议定书。由于双方的真诚努力，中埃两国贸易有了很大增长。1956年1月至8月，我国从埃及的进口额比去年同期增加二倍左右，我国供应埃及的物资比去年同期增加十二倍多。我国从埃及输入了一万六千多吨棉花、一万多件棉纱等物资。中国已成为世界上购买埃及棉花的第三大买主。埃及方面也从我国输入了许多工业产品、食品，农、副、土、特产品，例如钢材、纺织机、烧碱、硫化碱、丝绸、茶叶、冻牛羊肉、棉籽油等。毫无疑问，这些物资的交流对双方的经济都是有利的。
    在过去的一年中，中埃两国在贸易方面的来往也更加密切。埃及政府工商部部长穆罕默德·阿卜·努赛尔为首的贸易代表团访问中国，并且签订了两国历史上第一个贸易协定以后，1956年3月，以我国对外贸易部部长叶季壮为首的中华人民共和国贸易访问团应埃及政府的邀请，在埃及共和国作了为期一个月的访问，举行了关于发展中埃两国贸易关系的会谈。在访问期间，双方达成了四百万英镑金额的交易，中国方面购买了大量的埃及棉纱，埃及方面购买了中国的钢材、机器、植物油等。同时，我国在埃及还举办了商品展览会，向埃及人民介绍了中国经济建设的多方面的情况。这些友好活动对于加强中埃两国经济合作，增进中埃两国人民的友谊都有着重要作用。
    1956年5月，中埃两国政府建立了外交关系，并且互相派遣大使级的外交代表。这为中埃两国经济关系的巩固和发展奠定了更巩固的基础。
    由于中埃两国友好合作关系的日益发展，两国政府和人民都有着进一步扩大贸易的深切愿望。这个愿望充分体现在中埃两国贸易协定第二个议定书和支付协定中。新的议定书规定：双方同意各出口一千二百万英镑，比双方上年的议定书规定的金额增长了20％。贸易额度的增长，明显地反映了双方经济发展的要求。我们相信：在中埃两国友好合作不断发展的情况下，新议定书规定的贸易额度是一定能够圆满实现的。支付协定规定：由双方国家银行开立账户，用双方同意的货币定期进行清算。过去中埃两国每笔交易都是用英镑来支付的。苏伊士运河事件后英国无理的冻结了埃及的英镑，中埃两国就不能以英镑进行支付。中埃两国支付协定的签订大大便利了双方直接支付，从而有助于中埃两国贸易关系的进一步发展。
    中埃两国政府这一次贸易会谈的举行，正是埃及人民为苏伊士运河国有化进行反殖民主义斗争的时候。在谈判中也体现了中国人民坚决支持埃及人民的正义斗争的精神。大家知道，在埃及政府宣布把苏伊士运河收归国有的法令以后，美、英、法横暴地对埃及施用压力。它们不但调动了武装部队对埃及进行武力威胁，并且尽其能事地企图从经济上扼杀埃及。它们冻结了埃及在它们国家的财产和资金，禁止向埃及输出重要物资，等等。但是正如“人民日报”1956年7月30日社论所指出的：“威胁、恫吓，对于懂得‘不自由勿宁死’的意义的人民是丝毫没有作用的”。埃及政府和人民在全世界人民的支持下，团结一致地采取了一系列的相应措施，广泛地开展了同社会主义国家和亚非国家的贸易，给美、英、法帝国主义以有力的反击，获得了重大的胜利。中国人民为了支持埃及人民的正义斗争，在英国冻结埃及英镑存款的不久曾以二千万瑞士法郎交给埃及作为预付货款，帮助埃及解决一些外汇上的困难。同时为了支援埃及，我国继续购买了埃及主要出口商品棉花，还大量地供应了埃及所需要的棉籽油、冻牛羊肉、锡、焦炭、烧碱等物资，这些商品可以先行记账，不须支付外汇，以后再由埃及用物资来支付。同我国一样，苏联、印度、还有其他社会主义国家和亚非国家都在经济上大力地支援了埃及。我们坚信：在全世界人民的大力支持下，埃及人民的反殖民主义斗争必将获得彻底胜利。
    中埃两国经济关系之所以获得不断发展，是由于它一贯是建立在平等互利和真诚合作的基础上的。这正如周恩来总理在亚非会议全体会议上的发言所指出的：“我们相互之间的贸易来往和经济合作应该以促进各国独立经济发展为目的，而不应该使任何一方单纯地成为原料产地和消费品的销售市场”。在这里必须提到的是：中埃两国经济关系的不断加强和发展，是中埃两国政府和人民为了贯彻执行万隆会议的精神，实现万隆会议关于经济合作的决议所作的共同努力的成果。一年多来，亚非地区的许多事实证明，凡是执行了上述决议的国家，它们的对外关系都有了良好的发展。
    中埃两国在经济上也有着极好的互通有无的条件。中国方面不仅可以从埃及进口大量的棉花，而且也可以购买埃及的棉纱和其他产品。中国可以向埃及出口为埃及发展经济和人民生活所需要的、机器、纸张、丝绸、茶叶、食品、植物油和各种日用品等，此外还有许多产品如焦炭、小麦、牛羊肉也是埃及人民所需要的。中国还可以并且愿意根据埃及的需要供应某些工业成套设备。中埃两国在技术合作方面也存在一定条件。埃及在农业技术方面有许多地方是值得我们学习的，中国也愿意把自己生产建设中的技术经验提供给埃及方面。
    中国人民为中埃两国经济关系的进一步发展感到莫大欢欣，可以断定，这种友好合作的关系必将在现有基础上更迅速地向前发展。这种友好合作关系的不断发展是完全符合中埃两国人民利益的，它将在巩固亚非地区和世界的和平的事业中起着越来越显著的作用。
