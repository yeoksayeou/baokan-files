　　“We are cultivating and testing you.” This is what Xu Chunshan, the Party Branch Secretary of the Mutual Aid Village in Qianjin Township, Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, often says to those who apply to join the Party. How many new Party members has this Party branch developed in the past few years? Since the establishment of the Party branch in 1949 with the original fifteen members, not a single new Party member has been developed in more than seven years. The Communist Youth League branch was established in the village as early as 1949, and it currently has twenty-nine members, two-thirds of whom joined the League in 1949. Over the past few years, through the Party's cultivation, education, and the tempering of various political movements, their political and ideological awareness has improved, and some League members have long expressed their desire to join the Party. However, this enthusiasm for political advancement has not only failed to receive the necessary support from the Party branch, but has also been subjected to undue suppression and打击. Sun Tianyou, the Deputy Secretary of the League branch, and veteran League members Dong Fu and Ren Fukun, actively applied to join the Party as early as 1951, but the Party Branch Secretary replied: "Good! Don't worry, we'll study it later..." A year passed without any progress, so they had to ask the Party Branch Secretary again: "How is the study going?" This question, however, infuriated the Branch Secretary, who waved his hand impatiently and said: "Hey! What are you rushing for? Don't I know who is suitable and who isn't? You still need to be tested further!" Thus, one year of testing, two years of testing, and it has been tested for six or seven years without any results.

　　Has this Party branch really been cultivating and testing those who apply to join the Party? Since 1949, the matter of developing Party members has only been mentioned once at the branch meeting. As for each person who wants to join the Party, who meets the requirements, who does not, and which Party member specifically cultivates whom, it has never been studied at all. Li Hai (a League member), a staff member of the village supply and marketing cooperative, actively applied to join the Party in 1952, but the Party branch did not talk to him once for more than two years. Later, because Comrade Li Hai pursued the matter very closely, Xu Chunshan finally talked to him once and pointed out some shortcomings, but after Comrade Li Hai overcame his shortcomings, the Party branch became silent again. In this situation, Comrade Li Hai had to apply directly to the higher-level Party committee. After investigation by the higher-level Party committee, it was confirmed that the comrade did meet the requirements for joining the Party, so he was transferred to work in the district and admitted to the Party.

　　Why does this Party branch, especially this Branch Secretary, hold such an attitude towards absorbing new blood into the Party? In his own words: "Wouldn't others joining the Party take away my position!" "If we don't develop Party members, and all the Party members make mistakes, the higher authorities can't let non-Party members hold Party positions..." Because Xu Chunshan has this serious sectarian thought, this village has not developed a single Party member in more than seven years. This has greatly weakened the Party's leadership over agricultural production cooperatives.

    考验到什么时候？
    鲁逢山
      “正在培养和考验你。”这是黑龙江省海伦县前进乡互助村党支部书记许春山答复申请入党的人常说的一句话。几年来这个党支部发展了多少新党员呢？自从1949年由原有的十五名党员建立党支部时开始到现在已经七年多了，一个新党员也没有发展。早在1949年该村就建立了团支部，现有团员二十九名，其中有三分之二是1949年入团的。几年来，他们经过党的培养、教育和各项政治运动的锻炼，政治思想觉悟提高了，有些团员很早就提出了入党的要求。但他们这种政治上要求进步的积极性，不仅得不到党支部应有的扶植和支持，反而受到了不应有的压抑和打击。团支部副书记孙天友和老团员董福、任福坤，从1951年就积极申请入党，可是党支部书记的答复是：“好啊！你们不用着急，等以后研究研究再说……”一年过去了，还是没有一点动静，他们只好再问党支部书记：“研究的怎样了？”这一问不要紧，却把支部书记惹火了，他把手一摆，很不耐烦地说：“唉！你们着啥急呢？谁行谁不行我心里还没个数？你们还得再考验考验！”就这样一年考验，二年考验，一直考验了六七年，到现在还没有考验出个结果来。
    这个党支部对申请入党的人，是真的培养和考验了吗？从1949年到现在只是在支部会上提过一次发展党员的事。至于对每一个要求入党的人，究竟谁具备条件，谁不具备条件，哪个党员具体培养谁，根本没有研究过。该村供销社工作人员李海（团员）从1952年就积极申请入党，但是党支部二年多没有和他谈过一次话。后来由于李海同志追的很紧，许春山才找他谈了一次话也给他指出了一些缺点，可是当李海同志克服缺点后，党支部却又无声无息了。在这种情况下李海同志只好直接向上级党委申请。经过上级党委调查该同志的确具备了入党条件，就把他调到区上工作并吸收他入了党。
    这个党支部特别是这位支部书记，为啥对给党吸收新的血液抱这样态度呢？用他自己的话说：“别人入了党不是夺去了我的地位了！”“不发展党员，党员要都犯了错误，上级总不能让非党同志担任党内职务……”由于许春山存在着这种严重的宗派主义思想，这个村七年多来就没发展过一个党员。这样就大大地削弱了党对农业生产合作社的领导。
