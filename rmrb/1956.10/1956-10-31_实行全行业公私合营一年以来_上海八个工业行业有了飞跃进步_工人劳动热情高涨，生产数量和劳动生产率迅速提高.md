Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 30th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Gao Jie) reported: Shanghai's eight industrial sectors, the earliest to implement industry-wide public-private partnerships in our country, have made remarkable progress in both production and management over the past year.

These eight sectors are the cotton textile, wool textile, linen textile, paper making, cigarette, enamel, rice milling, and flour industries, which were jointly operated around October last year.

Over the past year, the 163 factories in these eight sectors have been initially reorganized for production and have been merged into 78 factories. The most significant changes have occurred in the rice milling and flour industries. Before the joint operation, the rice milling industry had scattered and outdated equipment, and its production could not meet Shanghai's needs, while the flour industry had a large surplus of equipment and was often operating at less than 30% capacity. After the merger and reorganization of the two industries, the surplus equipment from the flour mills was used to equip five new flour mills in Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Henan, and the rice mills were renovated and expanded using the flour mill buildings. Now, the production volume of rice mills has doubled compared to before the joint operation, and the monthly transportation expenses alone have been reduced by 12,000 yuan compared to before the joint operation. Before the joint operation, most of the wool textile and cigarette factories were producing in cramped and dilapidated factory buildings with poor working conditions. The spinning, weaving, dyeing, and finishing equipment of the wool textile industry were located in different places, making production very inconvenient. Now, 52 wool textile factories have been reorganized into 16 factories with full production capabilities, and the cigarette factories have been merged into four, greatly improving production conditions. In these eight sectors, factories that previously lacked welfare facilities such as dormitories, canteens, bathrooms, and nurseries due to their small size and small number of workers now have them.

To date, with the exception of a few small factories, all the factories in these eight sectors have established factory democratic management committees or employee representative assemblies with the participation of workers and representatives from both the public and private sectors. The most significant change is that workers' enthusiasm for labor has been very high, and production volume and labor productivity have increased rapidly. Since the joint operation, workers in wool textile factories have generally been able to manage twice as many machines as before the joint operation. After the merger of the eight worsted wool textile factories and knitting wool factories, the production shifts were changed from one to two, and then from two to three this year, with a large number of new workers joining the factories. However, the production order of the factories has always been very good. In the first three quarters of this year, the output of knitting wool and worsted wool fabrics increased by 90% to more than 100% compared to the same period before the joint operation last year, and the first-class product rate of worsted wool fabrics also increased from 50% to 80% before the joint operation to around 98%. In the first three quarters of this year, cotton textile factories did not increase production shifts or add a large number of workers, but the output of yarn and cloth increased by more than 30% to 40% compared to the same period last year, and labor productivity increased by 47.9%; labor productivity was 16% higher than the highest production year in the history of these factories, 1954. After the industry-wide joint operation, enamel factories also experienced the rare phenomenon of many factories having all of their products being qualified for the first time. From February to now, the industry has added more than 700 new enamel designs and has also successfully trial-produced acid-resistant enamel and cast iron enamel bathtubs and other high-end enamel products.

Another change in these public-private joint ventures over the past year is that factories in the industry have been able to adjust production among themselves, fully utilizing equipment potential. The seven wool textile factories expanded for the first time this year have a total of more than 10,000 worsted spindles, most of which were installed using idle equipment from public-private joint ventures. As a result, the entire industry can increase the production of worsted wool fabrics by more than 2 million meters per year. This year, paper mills have also successively installed seven idle paper machines in the industry, and with the potential being fully utilized, the industry produced 42% more paper in the first three quarters of this year than in the same period last year.

Many factories had never prepared annual or quarterly production plans before the joint operation, but now they are not only able to prepare them, but also able to produce according to plan. A complete set of planning management, technical leadership systems, and experiences from many state-owned factories have been widely learned by public-private joint ventures within a year. Many newly jointly operated textile factories are now able to steadily carry out production on a weekly and daily basis according to work plans. Currently, with the exception of a few that have reduced production due to objective reasons, most of these public-private joint venture factories have surpluses. The 15 newly jointly operated paper mills had an average monthly loss of more than 12,000 yuan before the joint operation last year, but in the first half of this year, they had a monthly surplus of more than 270,000 yuan.

    实行全行业公私合营一年以来
    上海八个工业行业有了飞跃进步
    工人劳动热情高涨，生产数量和劳动生产率迅速提高
    新华社上海30日电　新华社记者高洁报道：我国最早实行全业公私合营的上海八个工业行业，一年来，无论在生产上、管理上都有了飞跃的进步。
    这八个行业是去年10月前后合营的棉纺织、毛纺织、麻纺织、造纸、卷烟、搪瓷、碾米和面粉等工业行业。
    一年来，这八个行业的一百六十三个厂经过初步生产改组，已合并成为七十八个厂。变化最大的是碾米和面粉行业。合营前，碾米业设备分散、落后，生产不能满足上海需要，而面粉业则设备过剩很多，经常开工不到30％。两个行业合并改组以后，用面粉厂多余的设备为青海、新疆、河南等地区配备了五个新的面粉厂，碾米厂利用面粉厂厂房进行了改建扩充。现在，碾米厂生产量比合营前提高了一倍，每月单是运费开支就比合营前节省一万二千元。合营前的毛纺织厂和卷烟厂，大部分是在局促破旧的厂房里生产，劳动条件很差；毛纺织业的纺、织、染整设备各在一处，生产很不方便。现在，五十二个毛纺织厂已改组成为十六个生产全能的厂，卷烟厂并为四个，生产条件大大改善了。这八个行业中，以往因为厂小、工人少而没有宿舍、食堂、浴室、托儿所等福利设施的工厂，现在都有了。
    到目前止，这八个行业的工厂中，除少数小型厂外，都成立了有工人和公、私双方代表参加的工厂民主管理委员会或是职工代表会。最显著的变化是工人的劳动热情非常高涨，生产数量和劳动生产率迅速提高。毛纺织厂的工人从合营后到现在，看管机台能力普遍比合营前提高一倍。八个精纺毛纺织厂和绒线厂合营以后生产班次由一班改为两班，今年又由两班改为三班，大批新工人进到工厂；但是，工厂的生产秩序始终很好。今年前三个季度，绒线和精纺毛织品产量比去年合营前的同时期增长90％到一倍以上，精纺毛织品的一等品率也从合营前的50％到80％，提高到了98％上下。棉纺织厂今年前三个季度没有增加生产班次，也没有增加大批工人，纱和布的产量比去年同时期提高30％到40％以上，劳动生产率提高47.9％；劳动生产率比这些厂历史上生产最多的1954年还要高16％。搪瓷工厂也在全业合营后，第一次出现很多厂全厂全部产品都是合格品的罕见现象。今年2月到现在，全业增加的搪瓷新花样共七百多种，还试制成功了耐酸搪瓷和生铁搪瓷浴缸等高级搪瓷产品。
    这些公私合营企业一年来的另一个变化，是行业各厂之间互相调剂生产，充分发挥了设备潜力。毛纺织业今年第一次扩建的七个厂，共拥有一万多枚精纺锭，绝大部分是利用公私合营工厂中闲置的设备安装起来的，全行业因此可以每年增产二百多万公尺精纺毛织品。造纸工厂今年也陆续把行业中闲置的七台造纸机安装起来，加上发挥潜力，全业今年前三个季度比去年同期多生产了42％的纸张。
    许多厂在合营前从来没有编制过年度的或季度的生产计划，现在不仅能够编制，而且能按计划生产。许多国营厂的一套较完整的计划管理、技术领导制度和经验，公私合营厂在一年之内已经普遍学习过来。不少新合营的纺织厂已经能够每周、每日地按照作业计划稳步地进行生产。现在，这批公私合营工厂除个别的因客观原因减产外，绝大部分厂都有了盈余。十五个新合营的造纸厂，去年合营前平均每月要亏损一万二千多元，合营后的今年上半年已变为每月盈余二十七万多元了。
