    A bridge of people's friendship, crossing mountains and seas, connects China and Indonesia. On this bridge of friendship, the people of Indonesia and the people of China advance shoulder to shoulder, together toward lasting peace, a bright prosperity, and a new world of freedom and happiness.
    This is the shining ideal that Dr. Sukarno, President of the Republic of Indonesia, who recently visited China, radiated in his many moving speeches. As an outstanding engineer of human peace, President Sukarno is using all his talents to build and strengthen this bridge of friendship, which is fully in line with the wishes of the people of all peace-loving countries. His recent visits to the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Mongolia, and many other countries, and the warm welcome he received from the governments and people of those countries, show the deep friendship between the people of all countries and the people of Indonesia.
    The Chinese people warmly and solemnly welcomed President Sukarno and his entourage. Cheers of "Bung Karno" and "Merdeka" resounded everywhere President Sukarno went. Millions of people enthusiastically called him "Bung Karno," feeling very natural and exceptionally affectionate. This title contains the Chinese people's brotherly feelings for President Sukarno and the Indonesian people. Many more people wrote letters to express their sincere welcome and warm greetings to him. This newspaper alone received many letters from workers, students, soldiers, cadres, housewives, and returned overseas Chinese from dozens of provinces and cities. Even a hospitalized patient far away in the border area of Inner Mongolia had a nurse write out his heartfelt welcome to President Sukarno on his behalf. A university student in Beijing wrote: "It is you who have brought eight-two million fiery hearts, which very naturally merge with the equally fiery hearts of our six hundred million people. Our hearts are fiery, and the hearts of our friends are also fiery, which is worlds apart from the cruel and cold hearts of the imperialists who are plotting wars of aggression all day long!"
    Yes, since ancient times, the people of our two countries have crossed the ocean and interacted with each other. This visit by President Sukarno has further deepened the long-standing friendship between our two peoples. In these days, we saw the beautiful mountains and rivers of Indonesia in the cinema. We saw the moving dances of Indonesia on the stage. From President Sukarno's passionate speeches, we heard the magnificent voice of an independent Indonesia. We could not help but listen with a heavy heart as he accused colonialism of the common tragic experiences it brought to the people of Asia and Africa, and we also listened with joy as he recounted the heroic struggle of the Indonesian people for national independence, and we learned with full sympathy from him about the feelings and aspirations of the Indonesian nation over the decades. At the same time, during these days, President Sukarno held several talks with our Chairman Mao Zedong in an atmosphere of sincerity, understanding, and mutual respect, covering various international issues and the current relations between our two countries. At the same time, President Sukarno also visited many places in China, saw the boiling construction life of the Chinese people, and made extensive contacts with people from all walks of life in China. Through this friendly visit, President Sukarno naturally gained a further understanding of the Chinese people. This understanding will inevitably be conveyed to his country and people, thus further promoting and deepening the understanding and friendship between our two peoples. This friendship is something we cherish extremely.
    The friendship between us is the friendship between two fighting nations. Both of our nations have suffered the painful experience of colonial aggression, and now we are both working hard to eliminate backwardness and change the face of our countries. We both need a stable and peaceful international environment to guarantee our domestic construction. This common and profound desire for peace further unites us and allows us to advance together as comrades-in-arms in the struggle for world peace. President Sukarno's visit has brought the two peoples closer than ever before. The growth of friendship between us will greatly consolidate and strengthen the forces of peace in the Asian-African region and the world.
    As President Sukarno concludes his visit to our country and embarks on his return home today, we feel infinitely sad to see him go, and we ask him to convey the deep feelings of the Chinese people to the Indonesian people. The bridge of friendship between our six hundred million Chinese people and the eighty-two million Indonesian people has been built and is even more solid. It will stand in the Pacific Ocean, forever!

    中国和印度尼西亚的友谊之桥
    一座人民的友谊之桥，越过高山，跨过重洋，把中国和印度尼西亚联接起来。在这座友谊之桥上，印度尼西亚人民和中国人民并肩前进，共同走向持久的和平、美好的繁荣和自由、幸福的新世界。
    这是最近来中国访问的印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺博士在他许多次动人的演说中所闪耀着的光辉的理想。作为人类和平的一位杰出工程师，苏加诺总统正以他的全部才智来建设和加强这座友谊之桥，这是完全同各爱好和平国家人民的愿望相符合的。最近他访问了苏联、南斯拉夫、捷克斯洛伐克和蒙古等许多国家，受到各国政府和人民的热烈欢迎，就表明了各国人民同印度尼西亚人民之间的深厚的友谊。
    中国人民十分热烈和隆重地欢迎着苏加诺总统和他的随行人员。“朋加诺”和“默地加”的欢呼声响遍了苏加诺总统来到的每个地方。千千万万的群众热情地称呼“朋加诺”，感到十分自然，异常亲切。这个称呼包含着中国人民对于苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚人民的兄弟般的感情。许许多多的人更写信对他表示诚挚的欢迎和热烈的问候。仅本报就收到来自几十个省市的工人、学生、军人、干部、家庭主妇以及归国华侨的许多封来信。甚至远在内蒙古边疆的一位住院的病人，也让护士代他写出他欢迎苏加诺总统的心意。北京一位大学生是这样写的：“是您带来了八千二百万颗火热的心，它们非常自然地和我们六亿人民同样火热的心融合在一起了。我们的心是火热的，我们朋友的心也是火热的，这与那终日策划着侵略战争的帝国主义者们的残忍而冷酷的心有着天渊之别！”
    是的，自古以来，我们两国人民就横越海洋，互相往来。这次苏加诺总统的访问，更加深了我们两国人民之间的悠久的友谊。这些日子里，我们在电影院看到印度尼西亚美丽的山河。我们在舞台上看到印度尼西亚动人的舞蹈。我们从苏加诺总统热情澎湃的演说里，更听到独立了的印度尼西亚的雄壮的声音。我们禁不住怀着沉重的心情听他控诉殖民主义给亚非人民带来的共同的悲惨遭遇，我们也怀着欣喜的心情听他叙述印度尼西亚人民争取民族独立的英勇斗争，我们更怀着满腔同情从他那里了解几十年来印度尼西亚民族的感情和愿望。同时，苏加诺总统在这些日子里，同我国毛泽东主席在热诚、谅解和互相尊重的气氛下进行了数次会谈，涉及了各种国际问题和我们两国间目前的关系。同时，苏加诺总统还访问了中国许多地方，看到了沸腾着的中国人民的建设生活，和中国各方面的人士作了广泛的接触。经过这次友好访问，苏加诺总统自然更进一步了解了中国人民。这种了解也必然会传达给他的国家和人民，因而更加促进和加深我们两国人民之间的了解与友谊。这种友谊是我们所极其珍贵的。
    我们之间的友谊是两个战斗民族之间的友谊。我们两个民族都有遭受殖民侵略的惨痛经历，现在又都在为消灭落后，为改变国家的面貌而发奋努力。我们都需要安定的和平的国际环境，来保证我们的国内建设。这种对于和平的共同的深刻愿望，使我们进一步团结起来，作为争取世界和平的战友而共同前进。苏加诺总统的这次访问，已经使两国人民比任何时候更加接近。我们之间友谊的增长，必将大大巩固和加强亚非地区和世界的和平力量。
    当苏加诺总统结束访问我国并于今天首途回国的时候，我们对于他怀着无限惜别之情，我们请他转达中国人民对于印度尼西亚人民的深厚情意。我们中国六亿人民和印度尼西亚八千二百万人民的友谊之桥已经建立起来，并且更加坚固了。它将屹立在太平洋中，万古长存！
