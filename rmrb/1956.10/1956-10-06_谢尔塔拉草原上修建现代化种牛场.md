Xinhua News Agency: A modern cattle breeding farm is under construction on the Xiertala Grassland in Chen Barag Banner, Hulunbuir League.

This cattle breeding farm was designed by engineering technicians from the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute and the Hulunbuir League Urban Construction Bureau. After the cattle breeding farm is completed, most of the production processes—feed transportation, water supply, bathing, milking, etc.—will be automated and mechanized, and there will be electrical lighting equipment.

The cattle breeding farm specializes in breeding the famous locally produced Sanhe cattle. This type of cattle can be used for both milk and meat production. They have a large frame and high milk production, with the highest daily milk yield exceeding 20 kilograms. This farm will raise 300 basic mother cows. The bred stud cattle will be supplied to various state-owned farms locally and transported to pastoral areas across the country.

The construction of the cattle breeding farm began on August 27, and the entire project is expected to be completed next autumn.

    谢尔塔拉草原上修建现代化种牛场
    新华社讯　一座现代化的种牛场，已在呼伦贝尔盟陈巴尔虎旗谢尔塔拉草原上动工兴建。
    这座种牛场是华北农业科学研究所和呼伦贝尔盟城市建设局的工程技术人员设计的。种牛场建成后，大部生产过程——饲料运送、饮水、洗浴、挤奶等都是自动化和机械化、并有电气照明设备。
    种牛场专门培育著名的本地产三河牛。这种牛可以乳肉兼用，躯干高大，产奶量高，最高日产奶二十多公斤。这个场要饲养基础母牛三百头。培育出的种牛，除供应本地各国营牧场外，还要输送给全国各地牧区。
    种牛场修建工程已在8月27日开始，全部工程预计明年秋天完成。
