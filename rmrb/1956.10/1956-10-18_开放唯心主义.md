Open Idealism
郑昕
Lu Dingyi said in his report on "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend": "Among the people... there are distinctions between materialism and idealism in thought... The contradiction between materialism and idealism will continue to exist in socialist and communist societies as well... As long as they are not counter-revolutionaries, whether they propagate materialism or idealism, they have freedom... In short, we advocate that the distinction between the enemy and ourselves must be clearly distinguished politically, and we also advocate that there must be freedom among the people." The theory and policy are very clear; the policy is based on theory and facts. The expansion of the "People's Daily" and the opening of courses in idealism in universities are specific implementations of the policy. I would like to talk about a long-standing problem in our thinking regarding the "hundred schools of thought contend" policy, including "opening idealism." - the problem of the contradiction between academics and politics - the problem of the contradiction between academics and politics, and to talk about our assessment of idealism regarding the opening of idealism courses. These two issues are related. Opening idealism among the people is the key to solving the long-standing contradiction between academics and politics in our thinking; the contradiction between academics and politics should be attributed to the higher form of academics serving politics. And correctly assessing idealism is the premise for launching a struggle against idealism and ultimately defeating it.

First, let's talk about the first question. The practical significance of this wise policy is significant. It is an ideological liberation for the vast number of intellectuals who came from old China. It solves a major ideological contradiction for intellectuals - the contradiction between academics and politics.

Since liberation, our political consciousness has generally improved, but our idealistic academic thoughts have remained unchanged or have changed very little. We are both materialists and idealists: materialists in public and idealists in the study. We are materialists in politics and idealists in academic thought. This is our contradiction. The formation of this contradiction is inseparable from the objective situation after liberation. To clarify the situation, let me start with myself.

After the May Fourth Movement, I came into contact with advanced figures and advanced ideas, and I distinguished right from wrong politically, but I studied idealistic philosophy - Kantian philosophy. My formula was: politics is in charge of justice, and philosophy is the pursuit of truth. "Two souls are locked in one cavity." I lived like this for more than 20 years, until the eve of liberation (1948), when the flames of revolution were already imminent, I still published an article "High-Key Philosophy and Low-Key Philosophy." Marxism-Leninism is "low-key philosophy," which is for "governing the country and pacifying the world"; Kantian philosophy is "high-key philosophy," which is for "settling down and establishing life." The prosperity of the country after liberation made me have to admire Marxism-Leninism, which guided the victory of the revolution, and I began to feel that Kantian philosophy was useless. In the past few years, the country has achieved one victory after another on various fronts, the appearance of the earth and people's hearts have changed, thousands of years of dreams have been realized, and living in such a society makes people feel infinitely happy. In the words of the poet Goethe: "In this moment, I feel myself small and great at the same time." Each of us feels younger, and there is an unspeakable force and sense of responsibility hidden in our hearts. This is our new moral realm. The "governing the country and pacifying the world" and "settling down and establishing life" of the new society are unified. Kantian philosophy was finally rejected. At that time, schools collectively studied Marxism-Leninism, abolished idealism courses, and old teachers did not teach and strengthened their belief in abandoning the old philosophy. I would like to use the army's "giving up defense" to compare my handling of the contradiction between new and old ideas and new and old philosophies, just like the retreating army "giving up defense" to the occupying army, one side withdraws and the other side moves in; the new and the old have never met at all, let alone confronted each other. But ideology is different from the army, and it is impossible to "give up defense." Although the old ideology has declared "retreat" on the surface, it actually hides a huge potential force, which hinders the "takeover" of the new ideology at any time.

Our abandonment of idealism and acceptance of materialism is first and foremost linked to politics. Then, through ideological reform, the "Three-Anti," the "Five-Anti," the criticism of bourgeois academic thought, and the series of movements such as the "Purge of Counter-revolutionaries," the idealistic thought was linked to reactionary politics and the reactionary class. Those with more political enthusiasm have already washed their hands and declared that they have nothing to do with idealism and stood on the side of materialism; politics replaced philosophy. Those who still have reservations in politics also "suppressed" their own idealism and are willing to act as partners of materialism. The Party called on us to criticize the thoughts of Mr. Hu Shi, Hu Feng, and Liang Shuming, so everyone found their books, analyzed and criticized their idealism, and it was not necessary to touch their own idealism. The hidden idealistic thoughts and the public political enthusiasm, "two peaks facing each other, two streams flowing separately," do not interfere with each other.

Two kinds of ideological situations, two kinds of mistakes: one is the "leftist" erroneous thought of "politics is academics." We acknowledge the truth of dialectical materialism wholeheartedly. But acknowledging is not equal to understanding, and understanding is not equal to being able to practice. We declare ourselves to be dialectical materialists. This is a good wish, but a wish is not equal to the facts. In terms of academic theory, we have already felt the difficulty of learning, and when we connect it to work and life, we cannot be "handy." Why? The old ideological consciousness is at work, and the new academic theory has not become something that is connected with our flesh and blood. Time flies, and seven years have passed in a hurry. We have not learned the new well, and the old has been forgotten. Today, when we check, the reason why we have not learned the new well is that, on the one hand, it is not easy to achieve results when we learn new things with old ideas; and not combining the old with the new should be the main reason why we have not learned the new well. Why did we abandon the historicism of Marxism-Leninism and simply abandon the old philosophy? The main reason is that the "leftist" thought of "politics is philosophy" is at work. This erroneous thought separates the new from the old. The more we dare not face the old, the more unwilling we are to use new viewpoints to measure the old, and the more divided the new and the old become. The idea of maintaining the division between the new and the old is more like a lack of confidence in the new than a dislike of the old. Some time ago, a British Keynesian came to Peking University. We generously invited him to give a lecture, but one of our progressive professors who had believed in Keynes did not want to translate for him for fear of arousing "old feelings" for Keynes. We really believe that Marx was welcomed in through the front door and Keynes was sent out through the back door. This is the ideological "change of defense" and "giving up defense" analyzed above. If Keynes is still in the mind, it exists whether you mention him or not. It is safer to mention him. Only by seriously "contacting" him can we truly "break" with him. The same is true for Keynes, for other idealistic philosophers, historians, legal scholars... There are many people among us who are worried about opening idealism. They are afraid that doing so will "cause ideological confusion," which means "conceding to idealism," or even "advocating idealism." These are all "leftist" ideas that avoid idealism. This kind of thought is a harmful thought that exists quite universally among us.

The other is the erroneous thought of "academics for the sake of academics." People who hold this view originally had a distance from politics. Later, their political understanding and political enthusiasm improved, but the view of "academics for the sake of academics" was not removed. Thus, he and those who advocate "academics is politics" walked into: the "dual world" of hidden idealism and public political enthusiasm. This hinders us from truly and steadily accepting dialectical materialism in our thoughts. Dialectical materialism has become our tool for coping with the world, a "slogan" and "label" in our work, but our thoughts, feelings, and practice have not kept up. Why do people keep silent about their own idealistic thoughts? Because they are afraid of being linked to politics. In this way, academic thought (correct and incorrect) and idealism, together, become the "sacrifices" of political positions and viewpoints. Under this circumstance, ideological reform, criticism of bourgeois academic thought, and the victory of materialism over idealism are, strictly speaking, all incomplete and superficial. This is the general ideological situation in the old philosophical circle. (The old economics circle, history circle, law circle... are not much different.) Therefore, I said: Many of us are both materialists (in politics) and idealists (in academics). Premier Zhou and Minister Lu's assessment that the political and ideological situation in the intellectual circle has undergone fundamental changes and is undergoing further fundamental changes is completely correct; it is also a fact that there is a profound contradiction between political thought and academic thought. The "hundred schools of thought contend" policy is the key to solving this profound contradiction. This is what I said earlier: The hundred schools of thought contend policy is an ideological liberation for the vast number of intellectuals who came from old China. Why is it "ideological liberation"? In the past, idealistic thoughts were "suppressed" in previous political movements. Under the enthusiasm for political progress, idealism and materialism "changed defenses." Idealism became a synonym for political reaction. Only criticism was allowed, not defense. Idealistic thoughts were hidden deeper and more firmly. Today, academic viewpoints are no longer directly linked to politics. Criticism and defense of idealism are two sides of a free debate, which gives people with idealistic thoughts a sense of infinite freedom. Freedom is the starting point of transformation. It is difficult to convince people if only criticism is allowed and no defense is allowed. Support that cannot be convinced and criticism that cannot be convinced are both incomplete and superficial. Although idealism is incorrect, allowing the freedom to defend idealism can inspire a person with idealistic thoughts, on the basis of his political consciousness, to happily transform himself, criticize his own idealism, and gradually embark on the road of materialism.

"Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" provides old intellectuals with the conditions for the combination of academics and politics, and opens up the road for how academics can correctly serve politics. For myself, the call to "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" awakened my interest in old knowledge. I believe that while reorganizing my old profession, my level of Marxism-Leninism will gradually improve. This is my direct feeling about this great policy.

When I first heard the call to "Let a hundred schools of thought contend," I, like many friends, was worried that it would "cause ideological confusion." At that time, I thought: We have only been in power for seven years; materialistic ideas have not yet taken root in the hearts of the vast number of cadres; we should write positive articles and not rush to "open idealism," and so on. In the past few months, I have thought a lot about this issue, and it has been the most profound education for me. I have come to understand the truth that human consciousness often lags behind existence. The socialist construction of the motherland is advancing by leaps and bounds, international relations are unfolding rapidly, things are changing rapidly, and our thoughts are still stuck in the ideological stage when the revolutionary order was established, which makes me feel "suddenly" about such a farsighted policy; our thoughts are so behind actual life. It is correct for academics to serve politics, but it is not always correct to use the same method in the same way at any time. The contradiction between academics and politics, in philosophical terms, has its identity aspect and its difference aspect. In the early days of liberation, it was necessary to emphasize its identity more. Now that the objective situation has changed, the original contradiction has also transformed to its opposite - difference, which reflects the truth of the relative independence of academics from politics. Now, emphasizing the difference between academics and politics more is precisely to raise the service of academics to politics to a higher stage and a newer form. If we still use the old formula when we just established the revolutionary order, it will be unfavorable to us and favorable to the enemy.

Next, I would like to talk about the significance of opening idealism courses in schools. It is indeed an extraordinary thing to open idealism courses in universities in a people's democratic dictatorship. Its political significance lies in showing that our society has entered a new stage, and our objective conditions have matured to the point where there is no need for political "precautions" against idealism. Among the people, we allow idealistic and materialistic ideas to debate and compete freely, which shows that our universities have infinitely more ideological freedom and academic freedom than capitalist countries. Capitalist countries do not dare to let Marxism enter the gates of universities, but they boast about their "academic freedom"; but we allow idealism, which opposes Marxism, to be taught freely, which fully demonstrates the superiority of the people's democratic dictatorship: the people under the people's democratic regime can fully enjoy democracy and freedom. This makes me think of friends who are still stranded in capitalist countries. Don't have any more concerns, don't listen to the vicious propaganda of politicians in capitalist societies anymore; the motherland is eagerly waiting for you to return to study and lecture freely, the air of the motherland is free.

We will open two types of idealism courses, one is pre-Marxist idealism, such as German classical idealism, and the other is modern idealism, such as Russell's philosophy. The former type of idealism includes the issue of Marxist inheritance. Both types of idealism need to be correctly assessed, or: what kind of attitude should we take towards them to make them useful for our study of Marxism-Leninism.

In the past, because all measures had to meet the requirements of establishing a revolutionary order, we emphasized the revolutionary side of Marxism more and the inheritance side of Marxism less, which was also very natural. Now we have the conditions to think more about this issue. This is also one of the tasks that "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" brings to us. I would like to talk about one of the three sources of Marxism: German classical idealistic philosophy.

In the short span of forty years from 1781, when Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason" was published, to 1821, when Hegel's "Philosophy of Right" was published, German idealistic philosophers created valuable spiritual wealth for mankind. Correctly treating German idealism can bring rich historical heritage to Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, Engels said: "The German workers' movement is the heir to German classical philosophy." "We, German socialists, are proud to inherit not only Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Owen, but also Kant, Fichte, and Hegel." We have no reason to despise this historical heritage, or even simply deny it. This is one aspect. But on the other hand, we cannot have any "sympathetic understanding" of their idealistic system. Especially for the "revision" and supplementation of their right-wing descendants, we must resolutely reject them. This work is meticulous and calm, and it is a serious test of our position. Doing this part of the work well will be beneficial to the study of Marxism-Leninism. But in the past, we had two erroneous tendencies towards German idealism: a "leftist" nihilistic attitude and a right-wing "foreign dogma" attitude. In fact, they are also two kinds of dogmatism. People with the former tendency only pay attention to the revolutionary side of Marxist-Leninist philosophy, while ignoring its inheritance side, and only look for sentences in the books of Marxist-Leninist classical writers that negate Kant and Hegel, while not seeing the sentences in the books that affirm the beneficial factors in Kant and Hegel's philosophy. The latter is just the opposite, exaggerating the inheritance side of Marxism-Leninism too much, while not deeply understanding its revolutionary side, and only looking for sentences in the books of Marxist-Leninist classical writers that affirm Kant and Hegel, while ignoring the severe and principled criticism of Kant and Hegel by Marxist-Leninist classical writers. Both of these tendencies are wrong, and therefore harmful. Only by restoring their original features is correct. It is best to be able to outline the key issues in their philosophy and juxtapose and connect them with the philosophical issues of Marxism-Leninism so that we have a clear line of development, which is useful for our philosophical cadres. It is unnecessary to exaggerate the significance and role of German idealism too much; but it is useful and necessary for our philosophical cadres to learn it as a kind of knowledge of the history of philosophy. For those who talk about idealistic philosophy, this is the best opportunity to transform our idealistic thoughts. The more we use the spirit of seeking truth from facts, the closer we are to materialism and the further away we are from idealism.

In the past, the criticism of modern idealism in propaganda materials or classrooms was done by "killing it with one blow." Facts have proved that doing so is not beneficial to us. Our assessment of modern Western bourgeois idealists is not comprehensive enough. The following points are often ignored:

(1) They are all mental workers, and generally have self-esteem. After all, only a few people are directly willing to serve imperialist politics. (Russell has recently agreed to peace.)

(2) They generally have a solid foundation of knowledge. The three-hundred-year academic tradition of Western bourgeois society has its scientific level. People who are too outrageous cannot lecture in universities or write books.

(3) Their idealistic system, the philosophical conclusions they made for science, and the political conclusions they made for philosophy are all wrong. We scold them as "utterly reactionary" and "utterly decadent," mainly referring to this aspect.

(4) In terms of epistemology (and logic), it has a meticulous and in-depth side, although it is distorted and one-sided.

Is our approach "encouraging the enemy's ambitions and destroying our own prestige"? No. In order to stand on an invincible position on the ideological front, although we must despise the enemy strategically, we must value the enemy tactically. It is harmless for us to make a more comprehensive assessment of them.

The enemy we face is powerful. Since Marxism appeared on the historical stage, the Western bourgeoisie has spent a lot of effort and cultivated a large academic team to defend its "cultural fortress." Their idealistic philosophical system has also become increasingly sophisticated with the latest achievements of natural science. What they have painstakingly managed is the "alliance" of philosophy and science. They want to create the illusion that they represent "scientific philosophy." In "Materialism and Empiriocriticism," Lenin exposed their direction of "idealism of physics" and "idealism of physiology," but Lenin did not end this battle. Science is developing rapidly, and bourgeois idealism is also using this development more and more skillfully to arm itself. It is impossible to end the battle, and the scale of the battle can only be expanded and deepened day by day; it is impossible to kill the enemy with one blow. Of course, no idealism can have a real connection with science, but can only distort science in this or that way to accommodate their idealistic views; while materialism is naturally the ally of science. Almost all of our philosophical workers cannot master scientific knowledge well, which is one of our major shortcomings. The Party has organized natural scientists to study "philosophical issues in natural science"; organize the "alliance" of philosophers and scientists; the Department of Philosophy of Peking University recruits science graduates as graduate students; invites science professors to open "basic natural science" courses for the Department of Philosophy; in addition, improves the teaching quality of the history of philosophy, does not limit the history of philosophy to the framework of the struggle between materialism and idealism, but gives it rich content, improves students' foreign language proficiency, etc., to arm our young cadres. If we want to win in the field of philosophy, we have to do a lot of preparation work. Fighting against idealism is a "hard battle," it is an academic competition, it is a long-term struggle. The idea of ending the struggle is the idea of lazy people, it is the idea of no foresight, it is a manifestation of complacency. These are the roots of conservative ideas, and we must be very vigilant about them.

In order to finally defeat idealism, we must study idealism in depth; we must do concrete analysis work; we cannot replace argumentation with political slogans. Doing so is beneficial to us; it is not an attempt to make Western idealists submit. First of all, it is to make our own camp, which has some reservations about idealism, makes some concessions, and even friends who have some degree of fondness for idealism, feel that our work is reasoning rather than arbitrary, it is meticulous rather than rough, so that they are also happy to join our battle.

The "hundred schools of thought contend" policy expands our camp and strengthens our combat effectiveness, which will form an unprecedented unity of philosophical workers - old and young. Dialectical materialism is the last philosophical system of mankind. It has won the right to be freely disseminated on the land of nine hundred million people as an ideological weapon. Only by continuing to enrich it can we be worthy of being philosophical workers of our time. The "hundred schools of thought contend" policy, including opening idealism, is a new stage in the Party's policy towards intellectuals and cultural policy; the policy itself is a major development of Marxism-Leninism. It is so far-sighted and inspiring; especially for intellectuals, they deeply feel the Party's political trust in them and academic importance, they will exert their greatest strength to do their job well. Through the implementation of the "hundred schools of thought contend" policy, our philosophical circle will present a thriving atmosphere.

    开放唯心主义
    郑昕
    陆定一部长在他的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的报告中说：“人民内部……在思想上有唯物主义和唯心主义的分别，……唯物主义和唯心主义的矛盾在社会主义社会和共产主义社会中也还将存在。……只要不是反革命分子，不管是宣传唯物主义或者是宣传唯心主义，都是有自由的。……总而言之，我们主张政治上必须分清敌我，我们又主张人民内部一定要有自由。”理论和政策都说得十分明确；政策是根据理论和事实来的。“人民日报”的扩充篇幅和大学中开设唯心主义的课程是政策的具体实施。我想就包括“开放唯心主义”在内的“百家争鸣”政策谈谈我们思想中长期存在的一个问题。——学术与政治矛盾的问题——学术与政治矛盾问题、和就开设唯心主义课程这件事谈谈我们对唯心主义的估价问题。这两个问题是有关联的。我们在人民内部开放唯心主义是解决我们思想中长期存在的学术与政治矛盾的钥匙；学术与政治的矛盾，应归结为学术服务于政治的更高的形式。而正确地估计唯心主义，是对唯心主义展开斗争和最终战胜唯心主义的前提。
    先谈第一个问题。这个英明的政策的现实意义是重大的。它对从旧中国走过来的广大知识分子说是一个思想解放。它替知识分子解决了一个主要的思想矛盾——学术与政治的矛盾。
    解放以来，我们的政治觉悟普遍地提高了，但我们唯心主义的学术思想却原封未动或动得不多。我们既是唯物主义者又是唯心主义者：在公开的场合是唯物主义者，在书斋里是唯心主义者。在政治上是唯物主义者，在学术思想上是唯心主义者。这是我们的矛盾。这个矛盾的形成，是和解放后的客观形势分不开的。为着将情况谈清楚，先从我自己说起。
    我在“五四”以后即接触到先进人物和先进思想，在政治上分清了是非，但是我却学了唯心主义哲学——康德哲学。我的公式是：政治是管正义的，哲学是追求真理的。“一个腔子里关着两个灵魂”。我这样的过了二十多年，直到解放前夕（1948年），革命的火焰已烧到眉睫，我还发表了一篇“高调哲学与低调哲学”。马克思列宁主义是“低调哲学”，是“治国平天下”的；康德哲学是“高调哲学”，是“安身立命”的。解放后国家的盛况，使我不得不佩服指导革命胜利的马克思列宁主义，开始觉得康德哲学无用。几年来国家在各个战线上一个胜利接着一个胜利，大地的外表和人们的内心都改变了，千年的梦想实现了，生活在这样的社会里使人感到无限幸福，用诗人歌德的话说：“在这一刹那里，我感觉自己渺小同时伟大”。我们每个人都感觉年轻了，心中蕴藏着一股说不出的力量和责任感。这是我们新的道德境界。新社会的“治国平天下”和“安身立命”是统一的。康德哲学于是遭到最后的否定。学校里当时集体学习马克思列宁主义，废掉唯心主义的课程，老教师不教课，也加强自己抛弃旧哲学的信念。我想用军队“让防”来比喻我的处理新旧思想、新旧哲学的矛盾，好像溃退的军队“让防”给占领军，一方撤出去，另一方开进来；新与旧根本未会面，更说不上交锋了。但是思想意识并不同于军队，想“让防”是办不到的。旧思想虽然表面上宣告“撤退”了，实际上却埋伏着极大的潜势力，随时阻碍新思想的“接防”。
    我们的抛弃唯心主义和接受唯物主义，首先是与政治联系着的。尔后经过思想改造，“三反”、“五反”，资产阶级学术思想批判，“肃反”等一系列运动，都是将唯心主义思想和反动政治和反动阶级联系着。政治热情多一些的人，早已经洗了手，宣称与唯心主义无关，自己站到唯物主义一边来了；政治代替了哲学。政治上还有保留的人，也“压”下了自己的唯心主义，愿意充当唯物主义的伙伴。党号召对胡适、胡风和梁漱溟先生的思想进行批判，于是大家找他们的书，分析、批判他们的唯心主义，也都没有必要要碰到自己的唯心主义。隐藏着的唯心主义思想和公开的政治热情，“两峰对峙，双水分流”，各不相搅。
    两种思想情况，两种错误：一种是“政治即是学术”的“左”倾的错误思想。我们是心悦诚服地承认了辩证唯物主义的真理。但承认不等于认识，认识不等于能实践。我们宣称自己是辩证唯物主义者。这是善良的愿望，但愿望不等于事实。在学理上已经感觉到学习之不易，联系到工作和生活，更不能“得心应手”，为什么？旧思想意识作祟，新学理并未成为与我们血肉相联的东西。时光荏苒，七年匆匆过去，新的并未学好，旧的付诸遗忘。今天检查起来，新的之所以未学好，一方面由于带旧思路学新东西，当然不易奏效；而没有结合旧的学新的，应该是新的未学好的主要的原因。我们为什么背弃了马克思列宁主义的历史主义，简单地抛弃了旧哲学？其主要的原因是“政治即是哲学”的“左”倾思想作祟。这个错误的思想，使新与旧割裂。愈不敢正视旧的，愈不肯用新观点来衡量旧的，新与旧也愈分裂。愿意保持新与旧的分裂的思想，与其说是对旧的厌恶，无宁说是对新的无信心。北京大学前些时来了一位英国的凯因斯主义者，我们很大方地请他讲演，而我们一位曾经相信过凯因斯的进步教授却不想替他翻译，怕勾引起对凯因斯的“旧情”；我们真的相信马克思从前门迎进来，凯因斯从后门送出去了。这就是上面所分析的思想“换防”“让防”。如果思想里还有凯因斯，提不提他都一样地存在。还是提他比较稳当。只有认真地和他“接触”才能真正地和他“决裂”。对凯因斯如此，对别的唯心主义的哲学家、历史学家、法律学家……也如此。我们中间有不少人对开放唯心主义是不放心的。他们怕这样做会“引起思想混乱”，就意味着“对唯心主义的让步”，甚至是“提倡唯心主义”。这些都是回避唯心主义的“左”倾思想。这种思想是在我们中间相当地普遍存在的一种有害的思想。
    另一种是“为学术而学术”的错误思想。持这种观点的人，原先对政治是有距离的。后来政治认识和政治热情提高了，“为学术而学术”的观点并未去掉，于是他和主张“学术即政治”的人一道走进：隐藏的唯心主义和公开的政治热情的“二元世界”。这样就妨碍我们在思想上真正地、踏实地接受辩证唯物主义。辩证唯物主义成了我们应世的工具，变成我们工作中的“标语”、“标签”，而思想、感情和实践并未跟上去。为什么人们对自己的唯心主义的思想讳莫如深呢？因为怕和政治联系上。这样，学术思想（正确的和不正确的）和唯心主义一道，成为政治立场、观点的“牺牲品”。在这种情况下，思想改造，资产阶级学术思想批判和唯物主义对唯心主义的胜利，严格说来，都是不彻底的，表面的。这就是旧哲学界的一般思想情况。（旧经济学界，历史学界，法律学界……也并不两样。）所以我说：我们许多人都既是唯物主义者（在政治上）又都是唯心主义者（在学术上）。周总理和陆部长所估计的：知识界的政治思想情况已经有了根本变化，并且正在发生更进一步的根本变化是完全正确的；政治思想和学术思想存在着深刻的矛盾，也是事实。“百家争鸣”政策，是解决这个深刻矛盾的钥匙。这也就是我前面所说：百家争鸣政策，是对从旧中国走过来的广大知识分子的思想解放。为什么是“思想解放”？从前，唯心主义思想，在历次政治运动中“压”下去了，在政治上要求进步的热情下，唯心主义和唯物主义“换了防”，唯心主义成了政治反动的代名词，只许批判，不许辩护，唯心主义思想掩藏得愈深愈牢靠。今天，学术观点不再和政治直接联系了，批判和辩护唯心主义，是自由争论的两方，这就给有唯心主义思想的人以无限自由的感觉。自由是改造的起点。只许批判，不许辩护，就很难使人心服。不能心服的拥护和不能心服的批判，都是不彻底的，表面的。尽管唯心主义是不正确的，仍容许有辩护唯心主义的自由，这就能激发一个有唯心主义思想的人，在他的政治觉悟的基础上乐于改造自己批判自己的唯心主义，逐渐走上唯物主义的道路。
    “百家争鸣”对旧知识分子提供了学术与政治结合的条件，替他们开辟了学术如何正确地服务于政治的道路。对我自己说，“百家争鸣”的号召，唤醒了我对旧学问的兴趣，我相信在重理旧业的同时，我的马克思列宁主义的水平会逐渐提高的。这是我对这个伟大政策的直接的感受。
    当我初听到“百家争鸣”的号召时，我也和许多朋友一样，耽心会“造成思想上的混乱”。我当时想：我们掌握政权才七年；唯物主义思想还未在广大干部心中生根；应该做正面文章，不必忙于“开放唯心主义”等等。几个月来我对这个问题想得很多，给我的教育也最深刻，理解到人的意识往往落后于存在这条真理。祖国的社会主义建设在突飞猛进，国际关系在迅速展开，事情在急骤的变化，而我们的思想还是停留在建立革命秩序时的思想阶段，使我对这样高瞻远瞩的政策感到“突然”；我们的思想就是这样地落后于实际生活的。学术服务于政治是正确的，但，不是在任何时候用同样的方式都同样正确。学术与政治的矛盾，用哲学的术语说，有它的同一性方面，也有它的差异性方面。解放初期，多强调一些它的同一性是有必要的。现在客观情况变了，原来的矛盾也就向它的对立面——差异性转化，它反映着学术对政治相对独立性的真理。现在多强调一些学术与政治的差异性，正是把学术服务于政治提高到更高的阶段和更新的形式。如果还用刚刚建立革命秩序时的老公式，就会对我们不利而有利于敌人。
    下面想谈谈学校中开设唯心主义课程的意义。在人民民主专政的国家的大学里，开设唯心主义课程，的确是不平凡的事。它的政治意义在于说明我们的社会已转入一个崭新的阶段，我们的客观条件已经成熟到不需要对唯心主义作政治上的“戒备”了。在人民内部我们听唯心主义思想和唯物主义思想自由争辩，自由竞赛，这就说明了我们的大学里有比资本主义国家多得无比的思想自由和学术自由。资本主义国家不敢叫马克思主义进大学的门，但是他们夸口他们的“学术自由”；而我们却叫反对马克思主义的唯心主义自由讲授，这就充分说明人民民主专政的优越性：在人民民主政权下的人民是能充分享受民主与自由的。这里使我想到还淹留在资本主义国家里的朋友们。你们不要再存顾虑，不要再听资本主义社会的政客们的恶毒宣传了；祖国殷勤期待你们回来自由研究和自由讲学，祖国的空气是自由的。
    我们将要开设两类唯心主义的课程，一类是马克思主义以前的唯心主义，像德国古典唯心主义，一类是现代的唯心主义，像罗素哲学。对前一类的唯心主义包含马克思主义继承性问题。对两类唯心论都需要作正确的估价，或：用什么样的态度对待它们，才对于我们的马克思列宁主义的学习有用处。
    我们过去因为一切措施都要符合建立革命秩序的要求，对马克思主义的革命性一面强调得多一些，对马克思主义的继承性一面强调得少一些，那也是很自然的。现在我们有条件多想这方面的问题了。这也是“百家争鸣”替我们带来的任务之一。我想谈谈马克思主义三个来源之一：德国古典唯心主义哲学。
    德国从1781年康德“纯理性批判”出版那一年起，到1821年黑格尔“法权哲学”出版那一年止的短短四十年间，德国的唯心主义的哲学家们给人类创造了宝贵的精神财富。正确地对待德国唯心主义，就能给马克思列宁主义带来丰富的历史遗产。所以恩格斯说：“德国的工人运动乃是德国古典哲学的继承者。”“我们，德国的社会主义者，却以我们不仅继承圣西门、傅立叶和欧文，而且继承康德，菲希特和黑格尔为光荣。”我们没有任何理由轻视这一份历史遗产，甚至于对它作简单的否定。这是一方面。但另一方面也不能对他们的唯心主义的体系作任何的“同情的了解”。尤其对他们右派的后裔的“修正”、添补，一定要坚决地摒弃。这个工作是细致的，冷静的，它是我们的立场的严肃的考验。做好这部分工作，就会对马克思列宁主义的学习有益处。但是我们过去对德国唯心主义存在着两种错误的倾向：“左”的虚无主义的态度，和右的“洋粹主义”的态度。其实也是两种教条主义。有前一种倾向的人，只注重马克思列宁主义哲学的革命性一面，而忽略它的继承性一面，专在马克思列宁主义经典作家书中找否定康德、黑格尔的辞句，而看不见书中肯定康德、黑格尔哲学中有益因素的辞句。后一种正相反，过分夸张马克思列宁主义继承性一面，而不深刻理解它的革命性一面，只会在马克思列宁主义经典作家书中找肯定康德、黑格尔的辞句，而忽视马克思列宁主义经典作家对康德、黑格尔严厉的、原则性的批判。这两种倾向都是错误的，因此也是有害的。只有还他们的本来面目，才是正确的。最好是能够将他们哲学中关键性问题勾画出来，和马克思列宁主义哲学问题对立和衔接起来，使我们有个明确的发展的线索，这就对我们的哲学干部有用。过分地夸张德国唯心主义的意义和作用是不必要的；但把它当作一种哲学史的知识来学习，对于我们的哲学干部说是有用的，也是必要的。对于讲述唯心主义哲学的人说，这是改造我们唯心主义思想最好的机会。我们多用一分实事求是的精神，即多靠近一分唯物主义，多离开一分唯心主义。
    过去的宣传品或课堂中对现代的唯心主义的批判都是用“一棍子打死”的办法，事实证明这样做，对我们并无好处。我们对现代西方资产阶级的唯心主义者的估计是不够全面的，下面几点即常被忽略：
    （1）他们都是脑力劳动者，一般都是有自尊心的人。直接愿意为帝国主义政治服务的人毕竟是少数。（罗素近来亦赞成和平了。）
    （2）他们一般都是学有根底的人。西方资产阶级社会三百年来的学术传统是有它的科学水平的，太胡闹的人不能在大学里讲学，不能著书立说。
    （3）他们的唯心主义的体系，他们替科学所作的哲学结论和替哲学所作的政治结论都是错误的，我们呵斥之为“反动透顶”、“腐朽透顶”，主要的是指这方面说的。
    （4）在认识论（和逻辑）方面，有它细致和深入的一面，尽管是歪曲的、片面的。
    我们这样提法是否是“长他人志气，灭自己威风”呢？不是的。为着在思想战线上立于不败之地，我们尽管在战略上要藐视敌人，但在战术上要重视敌人，对他们作比较全面的估计，对于我们是无害的。
    我们面临着的敌人是强大的。西方的资产阶级，自马克思主义出现在历史舞台以后，花费了很大的气力，培养了很大的学术队伍来保卫自己的“文化堡垒”，他们的唯心主义的哲学体系也随着自然科学最新的成就而日益精巧。他们所惨淡经营的是哲学与科学的“联盟”，他们想造成假象：他们是代表“科学的哲学”。列宁在“唯物主义与经验批判主义”中揭露了他们的“物理学的唯心主义”和“生理学的唯心主义”的方向，但是，列宁并未结束这个战斗。科学一日千里地发展，资产阶级的唯心主义亦日益精巧地利用这个发展来武装自己。结束战斗是不可能的，战斗的规模只能日益扩大和深刻化；想一棍子打死敌人是办不到的。当然，任何唯心主义都不能和科学有真正的联系，而只能这样那样地歪曲科学来迁就他们的唯心主义的观点；而唯物主义却天然地是科学的同盟军。我们的哲学工作者几乎都不能很好地掌握科学知识，这是我们的重大缺点之一。党组织了自然科学家们研究“自然科学中的哲学问题”；组织哲学家和科学家的“联盟”；北京大学的哲学系招收理科的毕业生充当研究生；请理科的教授给哲学系开“自然科学基础”的课程；此外提高哲学史的教学质量，不将哲学史局限于唯物、唯心斗争的框子里，而给它以丰富的内容，提高学生外国语水平等等，来武装我们的青年干部。我们要想在哲学领域内取得胜利，要做许多准备工作。同唯心主义作斗争，是“打硬仗”，是学术竞赛，是长期的斗争。结束斗争的思想，是懒汉思想，是无远见的思想，是自满情绪的表现。这些都是保守思想的根源，我们要对它十分警惕。
    为着最后战胜唯心主义，就要深入地研究唯心主义；要做具体分析工作；不能以政治口号代替论证。这样做对于我们是有利的；倒不是企图使西方的唯心主义者折服。首先是，使我们自己阵营里的对唯心主义作某些保留，作某些让步，甚至在一定程度上对唯心主义爱好的朋友们，感觉到我们的工作是说理的而不是武断的，是细致的而不是粗糙的，使他们也乐于加入我们的战斗。
    “百家争鸣”政策，使我们的阵营扩大，战斗力加强，将形成哲学工作者——年老的和年轻的——空前的团结。辩证唯物主义是人类最后一个哲学体系，它已经作为思想武器赢得在九亿人口的土地上自由传播的权利，我们只有继续不断地来丰富它，才不愧为我们这个时代的哲学工作者。包括开放唯心主义在内的“百家争鸣”政策，是党对知识分子政策和文化政策的新阶段；这个政策本身就是马克思列宁主义重大的发展。它是这样地高瞻远瞩和振奋人心；特别对于知识分子说，他们深切地感到党对他们在政治上的信任和在学术上的重视；他们将会使出最大的力量来搞好他们的岗位工作。我们的哲学界通过“百家争鸣”政策的贯彻执行，将会呈现一片欣欣向荣的气象。
