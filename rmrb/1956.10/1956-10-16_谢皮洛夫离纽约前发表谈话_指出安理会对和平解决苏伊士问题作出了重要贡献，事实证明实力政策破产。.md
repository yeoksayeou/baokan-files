Xinhua News Agency, New York, 15th -- TASS, New York, 15th: Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov left New York by plane on the 14th to return to Moscow.

Before taking off, Shepilov made the following statement regarding the results of the United Nations Security Council meeting:

The existing developments in the Suez Canal issue have demonstrated the bankruptcy of the policy of strength. Eloquent facts prove that in our time, any international dispute can only be successfully resolved through negotiations. This is especially true when the dispute involves the freedom and independence of the people of all countries and the issue of their national sovereignty. In this sense, the results of the Security Council meeting are very enlightening. Because the Security Council reflected the results of the talks between the countries concerned, it made important contributions to the peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue. As everyone knows, the Security Council resolution reflecting this part of the talks was adopted unanimously. I would like to express my hope that talks conducted on the basis of complete equality of all parties concerned will fully resolve the Suez Canal issue in accordance with the lofty principles of the United Nations, for world peace, and to strengthen sincere cooperation among the people of all countries.

    谢皮洛夫离纽约前发表谈话
    指出安理会对和平解决苏伊士问题作出了重要贡献，事实证明实力政策破产。
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社纽约15日讯：苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫在14日乘飞机离开纽约前往莫斯科。
    谢皮洛夫在起飞以前就联合国安全理事会会议的结果发表了下列谈话：
    苏伊士运河问题已有的发展已经表明了实力地位政策的破产。雄辩的事实证明，在我们的时代里，任何国际纠纷都只有通过谈判才能顺利得到解决。在争执牵涉到各国人民的自由独立问题和他们的国家主权问题的时候，就尤其是如此。在这一意义上，安全理事会会议的结果是非常有教益的。由于安全理事会反映了各有关国家之间的会谈的结果，它对苏伊士运河问题的和平解决作出了重要的贡献。大家知道，安全理事会反映这一部分会谈的决议是全体一致通过的。我愿意表示希望，在一切有关方面完全平等的基础上进行的会谈将能根据联合国的崇高原则，为了世界和平和加强各国人民间的认真合作而使苏伊士运河问题完全得到解决。
