    Haikou Dispatch: Hainan Island plans to develop 760,750 mu of tropical cash crops next year, based on agricultural cooperatives. This plan was formulated by the Hainan Island Tropical Crops Department at the Tropical Crops Work Conference held on September 19, according to the development plan for Hainan Island. According to the plan, Hainan Island's tropical crops will more than double compared to the past next year.

    The conference also conducted full discussions based on the Hainan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's proposal to currently emphasize both increasing grain production and cash crops. The conference formulated specific guidelines for developing tropical crops: to truly adapt to local conditions, focusing separately on the management of rubber, coconut, oil palm, sisal hemp, sugarcane, coffee, pineapple, pepper, Sea Island cotton, and betel nut, and appropriately developing Java cotton, lemon eucalyptus, as well as fast-yielding tropical crops and tropical fruits, so that agricultural cooperatives can increase their income in the short term to subsidize the expenses of planting long-term crops. The goal is to use the accumulation of early-planted tropical crops to subsidize regular development investments, strive to achieve production supporting production, use Hainan's resource income to develop Hainan, achieve less investment, fast development, more income, and good quality, so that Hainan can quickly become an important base for providing tropical crop raw materials urgently needed for industry and national defense.

    In order to implement the above guidelines, the conference especially emphasized managing the existing 339,620 mu of tropical crops of the agricultural cooperatives, actively propagating seedlings, and relying on the help of state-owned reclamation farms and state-owned farms to solve the problem of seedling supply. At the same time, it is necessary to organize forces to extensively promote the guidelines for developing tropical crops to the agricultural cooperatives, mobilize members to make good plans, and encourage overseas Chinese to invest in management. The issue of incorporating existing cash crops into the cooperatives should be handled carefully, adhering to the principles of voluntary mutual benefit and reasonable evaluation. The tropical crops sections and technical guidance stations recently established in various counties should establish a guidance system to help agricultural cooperatives train technical cadres, and cultivate returned overseas Chinese who have experience in managing tropical crops to serve as technical cadres or technicians in the cooperatives, and actively prepare for the development of tropical cash crops.

    海南岛计划大量发展热带经济作物
    本报海口电　海南岛计划明年以农业社为基地，发展热带经济作物七十六万零七百五十亩，这个计划是由海南岛热带作物处在9月19日召开的热带作物工作会议，根据开发海南岛的规划方案拟定的。按照规划，明年海南岛的热带作物将比过去增加一倍多。
    这次会议还根据中共海南区委员会提出目前以增加粮食生产和经济作物并重的方针，进行了充分的讨论。会议拟定发展热带作物的具体方针是：切实因地制宜，分别以经营橡胶、椰子、油棕、剑麻、甘蔗、咖啡、菠萝、胡椒、海岛棉、槟榔为主，并适当发展爪哇棉、柠檬桉以及收益快的热带作物和热带水果，使农业社在短期内能增加收入，以补助栽种长期作物的支出，用先期种植的热带作物的积累补助定期发展的投资，争取以生产养生产，以海南资源收入开发海南，达到投资少，开发快，收益多，质量好的要求，使海南迅速成为提供工业和国防迫切需要的热带作物原料的重要基地。
    为了贯彻上述方针，会议特别强调要把农业社现有的三十三万九千六百二十亩热带作物管理好，积极繁殖种苗，并依靠国营垦殖场、国营农场的帮助，解决种苗的供应问题。同时组织力量，深入广泛地向农业社宣传发展热带作物的方针，发动社员订好规划，并鼓励华侨投资经营。对现有的经济作物入社问题，要认真贯彻自愿互利、合理评价的原则，慎重处理。各县最近成立的热带作物科和技术指导站，要建立辅导制度，帮助农业社训练技术干部，并培养对经营热带作物有经验的归侨充当社的技术干部或技术员，积极做好发展热带经济作物准备工作。　（曾珊）
