    Chu Xue Jing Lu Donates a Large Number of Precious Ancient Books
    Chu Xue Jing Lu, a private organization specializing in collecting and researching local literature of Hubei, recently donated thousands of ancient books to the Hubei Provincial Library. Among them are many extremely valuable local Hubei documents, such as the "Hubei Old News Excerpts" in forty volumes, which is an unprinted manuscript. The "Writings of Former Worthies of Hubei," the "Chong Ya Tang Series," and the "Mianyang Series" include many works by eminent local figures from Hubei throughout history. Also, the "Pinghua Zhai Collection" by Yuan Hongdao of the Ming Dynasty, the "Shancao Tang Collection" by Hao Jing, and the "Eryou Tang Poetry and Prose Collection" by Chen Wenzhu are rare editions.
    Chu Xue Jing Lu is located in Beijing and was established by Mr. Shi Rongzhang, Mr. Liu Yuan, and other senior scholars, with a history of thirty to forty years.
    In addition, Mr. Shi Rongzhang also donated his personal collection of more than four hundred types of works by Hubei people. The Hubei Provincial Library has now transported this batch of books from Beijing to Wuchang and plans to create a special "Hubei Local Literature and Information Room" to preserve them for the reference of scientific researchers.

    楚学精庐捐献大批珍贵古籍
    专门收集和研究湖北地方文献的私人组织楚学精庐，最近捐赠给湖北省图书馆古书数千种。其中很多是极宝贵的湖北地方文献，如“湖北旧闻钞”四十册，是没有付刻的钞本。“湖北先正遗书”、“崇雅堂丛书”和“沔阳丛书”里面包括了很多湖北历代乡贤的著作。又如明代袁宏道的
  “瓶花斋集”、郝敬的“山草堂集”和陈文烛的“二酉堂诗文集”，是很难得的板本。
    楚学精庐设在北京，是由石荣暲、刘园等老先生建立的，已经有三、四十年的历史。
    另外石荣暲老先生还把他个人收藏的许多湖北人的著作，约四百余种，也同时捐赠。现在湖北省图书馆已将这批书籍自北京运到武昌，准备专辟一个“湖北地方文献资料室”加以保藏，供科学研究工作者参考。
