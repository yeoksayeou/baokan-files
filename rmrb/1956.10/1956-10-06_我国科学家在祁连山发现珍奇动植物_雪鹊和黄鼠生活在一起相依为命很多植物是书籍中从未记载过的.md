    Chinese Scientists Discover Rare Animals and Plants in the Qilian Mountains
    Snowfinches and Ground Squirrels Live Together in Symbiosis; Many Plants Are Unrecorded in Books
    (Reported by our newspaper) In the snow-covered Qilian Mountains, Chinese scientists have discovered a large number of rare animals and plants. Detailed information and some specimens of these flora and fauna were brought back to Lanzhou in mid-September.
    Among these most precious animals, the Tibetan snowfinch and the ground squirrel have particularly attracted the attention of scientists. Although one is a bird and the other a mammal, these two animals live together in a symbiotic relationship in the same burrow. When the ground squirrel needs to move on the ground, the Tibetan snowfinch first flies out to see if there is any danger. When the ground squirrel hears the snowfinch's call, it knows that there is no danger and then emerges in groups. When the ground squirrels are active, snowfinches also scatter in pairs around the ground squirrels to stand guard. If they detect danger, they make a noise, and both the ground squirrels and snowfinches quickly hide in the burrow. The ground squirrels also take great care of the snowfinches and the eggs laid and chicks hatched by the snowfinches.
    This symbiotic phenomenon between birds and mammals is the first time our scientists have discovered it. In 1887 and 1922, Soviet zoologists Przhevalsky and Ossendowski respectively observed these animals in Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, China. Their writings on this subject attracted the attention of zoologists around the world.
    In the valleys above and below the snow line of the Qilian Mountains, scientists collected more than 120 kinds of plants this time, many of which are not recorded in botany books. Among them are precious alpine and plateau plants called "Dian Di Mei" (Androsace) and snow lotus by Tibetan compatriots.
    On the lush grasslands with sparse population, scientists also discovered herds of wild cattle, wild donkeys, and big-headed sheep. The big-headed sheep are fat and large, each weighing more than 300 pounds. Scientists say that this kind of wild sheep can be crossbred with domestic sheep to improve the breed of domestic sheep. Scientists also discovered many coal seams exposed on the ground in the northern part of the Tola Mountains.
    Scientists observed four of the six major mountains in the Qilian Mountains, covering a total area of 10,000 square kilometers, amidst thunderstorms, hail, frost, snow, and storms. Scientists have made preliminary scientific studies on the development prospects and natural conditions of agriculture, forestry, water conservation, and animal husbandry in the upper reaches of the Shule River and the Qilian Mountains.

    我国科学家在祁连山发现珍奇动植物
    雪鹊和黄鼠生活在一起相依为命很多植物是书籍中从未记载过的
    本报讯　在冰天雪地的祁连山里，我国科学家们发现了大批世界上罕见的动物和植物。这些动植物的详细资料和一部分标本，已经在9月中旬带回兰州。
    在这批最珍贵的动物中，西藏雪鹊和黄鼠特别引起了科学家们的注意。这两种动物虽然一种是鸟类，一种是兽类，但它们却相依为命地共同生活在一个土洞中。黄鼠要到地面活动，西藏雪鹊首先飞出去看看有没有危险。黄鼠听到雪鹊的叫声，知道没有危险，才成群出去活动。黄鼠活动的时候，雪鹊还成对地散布在黄鼠周围放哨，一发现危险，就发出叫声，黄鼠、雪鹊都迅速地躲进洞里。黄鼠也非常爱护雪鹊和雪鹊产下的卵和孵出的小鹊。
    这种鸟类和兽类的共生现象，我国科学家们还是第一次发现。1887年和1922年，苏联动物学家普尔日瓦尔斯基和俄森多斯基曾经分别在我国甘肃、青海和新疆看见过这种动物，他们这方面的著作，引起了世界动物学家的注意。
    在祁连山雪线上下的沟谷里，科学家们这次采集了一百二十多种植物，其中很多品种是植物学书籍中从来没有记载过的。这中间，有被藏族同胞叫做点地梅和雪莲的珍贵山地高原植物。
    科学家们在水草丰茂和人烟稀少的草原上，还发现了成群结队的野牛、野驴和大头羊。大头羊又肥又大，每只有三百多斤重。科学家们说这种野羊可以和家羊交配改进家羊的品种。科学家们还在讨赖山北部发现了许多露出地面的煤层。
    科学家们在雷雨、冰雹、霜雪和风暴中观察了祁连山六条大山中的四条大山，全部观察面积共有一万平方公里。科学家们对疏勒河上游、祁连山一带农林水牧的发展前途和自然概况作了初步的科学研究。　（匡匡）
