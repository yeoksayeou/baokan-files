Xinhua News Agency, 22nd — Burhan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, delivered a report on his visits to five Asian and African countries at a report meeting hosted by the International Affairs Group of the CPPCC National Committee on the 20th of this month. In his report, Burhan described his leadership of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation's visits to Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Syria, and Lebanon from February to June of this year, and the positive impact of these visits on consolidating and developing friendly relations between our country and these five countries.

Burhan said that the resolutions of the Bandung Conference and the Bandung spirit have deeply penetrated the hearts of the people of Asian and African countries, and have become an irresistible trend. The people of Asian and African countries are undergoing a great historical period of national awakening, and they are making unremitting efforts to get rid of the economic and cultural backwardness left over by Western colonialism. He also emphasized: "Friendship with the Chinese people" has become a unanimous call of the people of Asian and African countries. Although imperialists have tried to spread slander and vilification against the Chinese people among the people of these countries, the market for imperialist lies is shrinking in these countries. Our country's peaceful diplomatic policy has had an increasingly significant impact in countries thousands of miles away from our country.

The continuous development of friendly relations between China and Asian and African countries cannot be stopped by any force.

More than 1,000 people attended the report meeting, including CPPCC members, responsible comrades from various democratic parties and people's organizations, and staff members from central government agencies.

    在政协全国委员会国际问题组主办的报告会上
    包尔汉作访问亚非五国的报告
    新华社22日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席包尔汉于本月20日在政协全国委员会国际问题组主办的报告会上，作了访问亚非五国的报告。包尔汉在报告中叙述了他在今年2月到6月率领中国文化艺术代表团访问埃及、苏丹、埃塞俄比亚、叙利亚和黎巴嫩五个国家的情况和这次访问对于巩固和发展我国同这五个国家的友好关系所产生的良好影响。
    包尔汉说，万隆会议的决议和万隆精神已经深入了亚非各国人民的心中，已经成为一股不可抗拒的潮流；亚非各国人民正在经历着一个伟大的民族觉醒的历史时期，他们正在为摆脱西方殖民主义所遗留下来的经济和文化的落后状态而进行不懈的努力。他还着重指出：“同中国人民友好”已经成为亚非各国人民的一致呼声。虽然帝国主义者力图在这些国家人民中间散布诽谤和污蔑中国人民的谰言，但是在这些国家里，帝国主义的谎言的市场越来越缩小了；我国的和平外交政策已经在相距我国万里之外的国度里产生了日益巨大的影响。
    中国同亚非各国间的友好关系的不断发展，是任何势力也阻挡不了的。
    参加这次报告会的有政协委员、各民主党派和各人民团体的负责同志以及中央各机关的工作人员等共一千多人。
