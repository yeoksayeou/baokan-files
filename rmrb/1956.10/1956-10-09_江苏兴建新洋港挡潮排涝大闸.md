Xinhua News Agency: Jiangsu is building the New Yanggang tide-blocking and drainage sluice gate, the second phase of the tide-blocking and drainage project in the Lixiahe area of Jiangsu Province. Construction officially began on September 23rd, and more than 10,000 migrant workers are excavating the sluice pond.

The New Yanggang Sluice Gate is being built at the port of New Yanggang, which runs through Sheyang and Yancheng counties. The sluice gate is 198.25 meters long, 11.5 meters high, and has 17 openings; a 2.5-kilometer-long diversion canal is being excavated; a 434-meter-long river dam is being built; and a new 20-kilometer-long seawall will be built and connected to the seawalls in the north and south. The entire project is expected to be completed before the flood season next year.

The Lixiahe area is the main grain-producing area of Jiangsu Province, with serious waterlogging disasters and frequent seawater backflow. In order to further develop agricultural production in the Lixiahe area, it was decided to complete the drainage and tide-blocking project in three phases. The first phase was completed this spring. The New Yanggang Sluice Gate and the Sheyang River Sluice Gate, which was completed in the first phase, as well as the Doulonggang Sluice Gate, which is about to be built, will jointly play a role as important gateways for tide-blocking and drainage along the northern coast of Jiangsu Province. They will free 14 million mu of cultivated land in the Lixiahe area from the disasters of floods, droughts, waterlogging, and saltwater intrusion, creating good conditions for converting dry land into paddy fields, converting single-cropping rice fields into double-cropping rice-wheat fields, and developing shipping and fisheries.

　　江苏兴建新洋港挡潮排涝大闸
    新华社讯　江苏省里下河地区挡潮排涝第二期工程——新洋港挡潮排涝大闸，于9月23日正式动工兴建，一万多民工们正在开挖闸塘。
    新洋港大闸兴建在贯穿射阳、盐城两县的新洋港港口。这座大闸长达一百九十八点二五公尺，高十一点五公尺，十七个孔；开挖二点五公里长的引河一条；建筑四百三十四公尺长拦河坝一座；并新建二十公里海堤，和南北的海堤相衔接。全部工程预计在明年汛期前建成。
    里下河地区，是江苏省的主要粮产区，内涝灾害严重，并常发生海潮倒灌的情况。为了进一步发展里下河地区的农业生产，决定分三期完成排水挡潮工程，今年春季已完成了第一期工程。新洋港闸和第一期工程中完工的射阳河闸，以及就要兴建的斗龙港闸将共同发挥作用，成为江苏省北部沿海挡潮排涝的重要门户，将使里下河地区一千四百万亩耕地解除洪水、旱涝和咸水倒灌的灾害，为旱田改水田、一熟稻田改稻麦两熟田、发展航运事业和渔业等生产，创造良好条件。
