Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 18th - Enterprises affiliated with the Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry improved their production situation in September and overfulfilled the production plans for five major products. Among them, iron ore was completed at 107.6%, metallurgical coke at 103.2%, pig iron at 105.7%, steel at 103.4%, and steel products at 103.2%. The actual production volume increased significantly compared to the same period last year, with iron ore at 158.4% of the same period last year, metallurgical coke at 134.8%, pig iron at 107.4%, steel at 129.6%, and steel products at 127.4%.

The production level of each specialized area has improved to varying degrees compared to the past. In terms of ironmaking, due to the further promotion of advanced experiences in rapid combustion of hot blast stoves and self-fluxing sintered ore by various enterprises, the utilization of effective blast furnace volume has mostly improved compared to August. Among them, Longyan Iron Mine and Ma'anshan Iron Mine have seen more significant improvements. In terms of steelmaking, due to the continued promotion of advanced experiences in rapid steelmaking in open-hearth furnace production, the average smelting time for most open-hearth furnaces throughout the month has been shortened compared to August. For example, Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 used 57 minutes less to refine a furnace of steel compared to August, while open-hearth furnaces at Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 5 and Tianjin Steel Plant used 40 minutes and 28 minutes less, respectively. The number of heats per day in converter production units also increased in September compared to August, with Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 and Daye Steel Plant increasing the number of heats per day by seven and nine, respectively. There have also been improvements in steel rolling.

In the past few months, some enterprises under the bureau have not performed well in completing steel and steel product production plans due to seasonal and other influences. This situation has improved in September.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 18th - From January to September this year, the steel production of the entire Liaoning Province has more than doubled compared to the entire year of 1952, and iron production has also increased significantly. At Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the estimated steel and iron production this year will increase more than threefold compared to 1952. The steel produced by Benxi Iron and Steel Company in the first eight months of this year exceeded the steel production for the entire year of 1953 by more than 41%.

During this period, the variety of steel produced by steel plants in Liaoning Province has also increased significantly. Currently, the province can produce more than 250 types of special steel. Anshan Iron and Steel could only refine 34 types of steel in 1953, but this year it has increased to 63 types. The variety of steel products has also increased from 84 types in 1952 to 160 types. Among them, products such as 37 types of channel steel, I-beams, square steel, round steel rolled by large rolling mills, various seamless steel pipes produced by seamless steel pipe plants, and thin plates of different thicknesses rolled by the No. 2 Thin Plate Plant are all products that China has not produced in the past.

    钢铁局所属企业推广先进经验扭转落后局面
    九月份超额完成五种主要产品计划
    辽宁钢的产量比1952年增加一倍多
    本报讯　冶金工业部钢铁工业管理局所属企业9月份生产情况好转，超额完成了五种主要产品的生产计划。其中铁矿石完成107.6％，冶金焦完成103.2％，生铁完成105.7％，钢完成103.4％，钢材完成103.2％。实际生产量比去年同期都有很大增长，铁矿石为去年同期的158.4％，冶金焦为134.8％，生铁为107.4％，钢为129.6％，钢材为127.4％。
    各专业生产水平比过去都有不同程度的提高。在炼铁方面，由于各企业进一步推行了热风炉快速燃烧和自熔性烧结矿的先进经验，高炉有效容积的利用大部分都比8月份有所改善。其中改进较多的有龙烟铁矿和马鞍山铁矿，炼钢方面平炉生产由于继续推行了快速炼钢的先进经验，多数平炉的全月平均熔炼时间都比8月份有所缩短，例如上海钢铁一厂炼一炉钢比8月份少用五十七分钟，上海钢铁五厂和天津钢厂的平炉少用了四十分钟和二十八分钟；转炉生产的各单位9月份日吹炉数也比8月份有所提高，上海钢铁一厂和大冶钢厂的日吹炉数比8月份提高了七炉和九炉；轧钢方面也有改进。
    在过去的几个月中，这个局的一些企业由于季节性等的影响，钢和钢材生产计划完成的不够好，这种局面在9月份已有了好转。
    新华社沈阳18日电　今年1月到9月，辽宁省全省钢的产量比1952年全年增加了一倍多，铁的产量也增加了很多。在鞍山钢铁公司，今年的钢和铁的产量预计将比1952年增加三倍以上。本溪钢铁公司今年前八个月生产的钢，比1953年全年钢的产量还多41％以上。
    在这期间，辽宁省各钢厂生产的钢的品种也增加了很多。目前全省能够生产的特殊钢已增加到二百五十多种。鞍钢在1953年只能炼三十四种钢，今年增加到六十三种；钢材品种也从1952年的八十四种增加到一百六十种。其中如大型轧钢厂轧制的三十七种槽钢、工字钢、方钢、元钢，无缝钢管厂生产的各种无缝钢管，第二薄板厂轧制的厚度不同的薄板等，都是我国过去没有生产过的产品。
