Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhao Qian reports: Beijing's local industries are universally establishing and improving experimental research institutions to enhance product quality through improved production technology. The First and Second Local Industry Bureaus alone have allocated over 1.7 million yuan in investment to establish laboratories and purchase experimental equipment for various factories.

    Unified laboratories established in some larger industries have already begun to solve product quality issues for factories. The Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Joint Laboratory is currently assisting the Beijing Knitting Factory in improving product quality. The central laboratory for the machinery and metal processing industries has conducted precise technical reviews of over a dozen products manufactured by various factories, such as receivers, radios, and electric fans, and has provided specific improvement suggestions to the factories. The expanded laboratory of the Beijing Food Factory has added bacterial testing equipment to regularly inspect finished products and improve hygiene in the production process. After the Yanjing Paper Mill's laboratory added instruments to measure paper smoothness, the qualification rate of letterpress printing paper increased from 84% to 98%. The Beijing Knitting Factory's laboratory studied the dyeing processes of red, vulcanized cyan, and coffee colors, stabilizing dyeing quality, and reducing the amount of fabric that needed to be reworked and re-dyed by 90% compared to the past.

    These experimental institutions are also actively helping workers improve production technology. The brick and tile factory's laboratory has added equipment for testing various physical properties of bricks and tiles. Through freeze-thaw testing, the laboratory found that the reason for the bricks' lack of resistance to weathering and corrosion was that they were fired insufficiently. As a result, workers learned from the experience of Tianjin's coke bricks and fired the bricks adequately. The bricks produced now are not only durable but can also withstand twice the pressure as before. Workers at the Beijing No. 1 Printing Factory receive a description of the properties of ink and paper made by the laboratory when they receive raw materials. This allows workers to operate according to the performance of different raw materials, ensuring that products meet quality standards.

    Engineering and technical personnel have also organized technical research institutions to focus on solving problems existing in product quality. The 97 engineers from various machinery and metal processing factories under the Third Local Industry Bureau have formed a technical research association, which is currently collecting problems encountered by various factories in product quality, preparing to concentrate efforts to solve them one by one. The technical personnel of the Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory's research laboratory have formed a preparation research group, which is working to solve the problem of drug deterioration during storage, starting with the prescription.

    改进生产技术提高产品质量
    北京地方工业加强试验研究机构
    新华社10日讯　新华社记者赵谦报道：北京市地方工业普遍建立和健全试验、研究机构，通过改进生产技术提高产品的质量。仅第一第二两个地方工业局就拨出一百七十多万元的投资，为各厂建立试验室，购置试验设备。
    一些较大的行业建立的统一的试验室，已经开始为工厂解决产品质量问题。棉织印染联合试验室现在正在帮助北京市针织厂改进产品质量。机械和金属加工行业的中心试验室已经对各厂生产的受话器、收音机、电扇等十几种产品作了精密的技术审查，提出具体改进意见，交给工厂改进。经过扩充的北京市食品厂的化验室增加了细菌检验设备，随时检查成品，改进生产过程的卫生情况。燕京造纸厂的试验室增加了测验纸的平滑度等仪器后，凸版印刷纸的合格率由84％提高到98％。北京市针织厂的试验室研究了红、硫化青、咖啡等颜色的染色工艺过程，使染色质量稳定，返工重染的布比过去减少了90％。
    这些试验机构还积极帮助工人们改进生产技术。砖瓦工厂的试验室增添了各种试验砖瓦物理性能的设备。经过耐冻试验，试验室找出了砖不耐风化腐蚀的原因是烧得太生，于是工人们学习了天津烧焦砖的经验，烧足火度。现在生产出来的砖不仅使用耐久，而且可以承受比从前大一倍的压力。北京市印刷一厂的工人在领原材料时，同时拿到一张试验室作出的油墨、纸张性能的说明，这样，工人就可以根据不同原材料的性能进行操作，保证产品合乎质量标准。
    工程技术人员也组织了技术研究机构，集中力量解决在产品质量上存在的问题。第三地方工业局各机械和金属加工工厂的九十七个工程师组成了技术研究会，现在正在收集各厂在产品质量上遇到的问题，准备集中力量，一个个加以解决。北京市制药厂研究室技术人员组成了制剂研究组，正在从处方着手，解决药品在储藏中变质的问题。
