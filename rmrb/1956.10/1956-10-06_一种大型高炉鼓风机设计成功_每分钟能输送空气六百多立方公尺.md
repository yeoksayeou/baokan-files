    A Large Blast Furnace Blower Successfully Designed
    Can Transport Over 600 Cubic Meters of Air Per Minute
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The design personnel of the Shanghai Turbine Factory recently designed a blast furnace blower. It can transport over 600 cubic meters of air per minute and is specifically designed for blast furnaces in our country with an annual output of 100,000 tons of pig iron. Such a large blower has never been built domestically before. The design personnel referred to materials from the Soviet Union, France, Britain, the United States and other countries, as well as drawings of smaller blowers previously produced by the factory. They began independent design in late May of this year and completed the design in mid-September. Currently, the factory is preparing for the manufacture of this blower.

    一种大型高炉鼓风机设计成功
    每分钟能输送空气六百多立方公尺
    新华社讯　上海汽轮机厂的设计人员最近设计了一种高炉鼓风机。它每分钟能输送空气六百多立方公尺，是专门为我国建设年产十万吨生铁的高炉而设计的。这样大的鼓风机，过去国内从未造过。设计人员参考了苏、法、英、美等国的资料和以前这个厂生产的小型鼓风机的图纸，从今年5月下旬开始进行独立设计，在9月中旬设计完成。目前，这个厂正在为制造这种鼓风机进行着准备工作。
