Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd: According to TASS, New York, October 22nd: The issue of stopping hydrogen bomb tests has become a central issue in the American election campaign.

The Republican candidates and leaders wanted to dismiss this issue, but it did not yield the results they expected. The American masses are increasingly recognizing that stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons is the first step in solving the disarmament issue.

This is why the slogan put forward by the Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson has received a broad response.

Recently, Ralph Lapp (a Republican), an atomic scientist at the California Institute of Technology and Columbia University, and the author of "Atoms and Humanity," Smith, a former member of the Atomic Energy Commission and the author of the famous "Smyth Report" on atomic energy, and Bentley Glass, a professor of biology and a member of the committee studying the effects of radiation on organisms, have all expressed their support for this proposal. Thirty-seven professors and lecturers at the City College of New York passed a resolution calling on the United States to issue a statement expressing its readiness to jointly halt hydrogen bomb tests with other countries. Among those who signed the resolution was Professor Zemansky, who participated in the manufacture of the first atomic bombs.

Twenty-four professors and teaching assistants of physics, medicine, and biology at the University of Washington also advocate stopping nuclear weapon tests. Five atomic scientists at the National Argonne Laboratory said they believe that the proposal to stop hydrogen bomb tests is "feasible, reasonable, and fully in the interest of the United States."

Newspaper editorial offices have received many letters from readers advocating a ban on nuclear weapons. A letter to the Washington "Star" signed "Observer" emphasized that the issue of banning nuclear weapon tests is a matter of extreme concern to voters. He said: "If we greatly reduce the billions of dollars we spend each year on military preparations and buying off other countries, then the money saved could be used to make up for the deficit and eliminate poverty for those in our country who have not benefited from the false prosperity." Many newspapers have published letters from readers advocating a ban on nuclear weapon tests.

Furthermore, the Democratic presidential and vice-presidential candidates, Stevenson and Kefauver, criticized Eisenhower on October 22 for rejecting Soviet Premier Bulganin's proposal to stop hydrogen bomb tests.

In a speech in Chicago, Stevenson expressed agreement with Eisenhower's so-called "interference" in internal affairs, but he said that Eisenhower's rejection of Bulganin's proposal without "sober consideration" was "unfortunate." He said that the United States should study Bulganin's proposal "immediately and from all aspects."

Stevenson pointed out: "Just last year at the Geneva summit, the President told us that the Soviet leaders desired peace just as we did." He said that Eisenhower's outright rejection of the Soviet proposal in his reply was a contradictory attitude.

Kefauver said in a speech in Pocatello, Idaho, that he was very "shocked" by Eisenhower's "stubborn and irritable reply," and he advocated that the United States should negotiate with the Soviet Union.

    美国选民要求停止氢弹试验
    史蒂文森等抨击艾森豪威尔拒绝布尔加宁建议
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社纽约22日讯：停止试验氢弹问题成了美国竞选运动中的中心问题。
    共和党的候选人和领导人想撇开这个问题，可是没有收到他们预期的结果。美国选民群众越来越认识到，停止试验原子武器和氢武器是解决裁军问题的第一步。
    正因为这样，民主党总统候选人史蒂文森提出的这个口号得到了广泛的反应。
    最近，加利福尼亚工学院和哥伦比亚大学的原子学家、“原子和人类”一书的作者拉尔夫，莱普（共和党人）、前任原子能委员会委员和著名的关于原子能的“史密斯报告”的作者史密斯、生物学教授和放射性对生物体影响研究委员会委员本特利·格拉斯都表示支持这个主张。纽约市学院的三十七位教授和讲师通过了一项决议，呼吁美国发表声明，表示准备和其他国家共同停止氢弹试验。在这项决议上签字的有参加制造头几颗原子弹的泽曼斯基教授。
    华盛顿大学的二十四位物理学、医学和生物学教授和助教也主张停止核子武器试验。国立阿冈尼研究所的五位原子科学家说，他们认为，停止氢弹试验的建议是“行得通的、合理的、完全符合美国的利益的”。
    各报编辑部收到许多读者来信，主张禁止核子武器。华盛顿“明星报”刊载的一封署名“观察家”的信着重指出，禁止试验核子武器的问题是选民极其关心的问题。他说：“如果把我们每年耗费在军事准备和收买其他国家方面的几十亿美元大大减少，那么，节省下来的钱就可以用于弥补赤字，为我们本国没有从虚假繁荣得到好处的人消除贫困。”许多报纸都发表了主张禁止试验核子武器的读者来信。
    又讯　美国民主党正副总统候选人史蒂文森和克弗维尔10月22日抨击艾森豪威尔拒绝苏联总理布尔加宁关于停止氢弹试验的建议。
    史蒂文森在芝加哥发表的演说里表示同意艾森豪威尔的所谓“干涉”内政的说法，但是，他说，艾森豪威尔没有经过“清醒的考虑”就拒绝布尔加宁的建议是“不幸的”。他说，美国应当“立即和从各方面”研究布尔加宁的建议。
    史蒂文森指出：“仅仅在去年日内瓦政府首脑会议的时候，总统曾经告诉我们说，苏联领袖正像我们一样地希望和平。”他说，艾森豪威尔在复信中干脆拒绝了苏联的建议，这是一种前后矛盾的态度。
    克弗维尔在爱达华州波卡提洛城发表演说时说，他对艾森豪威尔的“顽冥的、暴躁的复信”感到非常“震惊”，他主张美国应当同苏联进行谈判。
