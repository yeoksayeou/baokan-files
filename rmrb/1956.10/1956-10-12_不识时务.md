    Out of Touch
    During the Security Council meeting discussing the Suez Canal issue, the Australian representative attacked Egypt with the tone of a colonialist, and also threatened all Asian and African countries. Prior to this, Australian Prime Minister Menzies delivered a speech in parliament, clamoring for "sanctions" against Egypt, and loudly chanting his warmongering tune of "using force." Later, Menzies clamored again for "exerting pressure" on Egypt.
    Since the Suez Canal issue arose, Australia has been actively playing the role of a henchman for the colonialists. Menzies took on the role of chairman of the "Five-Nation Committee" planned by Britain, France, and the United States, and went to Egypt to peddle the "Dulles Plan." But Menzies was unable to complete his inglorious task and had to return disappointed. The crestfallen Menzies was very annoyed, and soon after returning home, he yelled and screamed at Egypt, on the one hand to vent his anger, and on the other hand to help the British, French, and American policy of military threat.
    But this time, Menzies was a bit too out of touch. Now is the time when Britain, France, and the United States, under the strong pressure of world opinion, have to talk about "peaceful resolution" at least in words. Menzies' clamoring only makes people more suspicious of the intentions of Britain, France, and the United States in bringing the Suez Canal issue to the Security Council. The "New India Times" of Delhi pointed out that "Menzies' remarks show that the West... only cares about using force to achieve their selfish interests. If they care about international peace, then they would not take such war-provoking actions before the Security Council meeting is held."
    Precisely because he is out of touch, Menzies' clamoring not only failed to gain appreciation, but also proved thankless, earning him scolding from all sides. World opinion and the Egyptian people are indignant at Menzies' remarks. Australian Parliamentary Opposition Leader Herbert Vere Evatt said that Menzies' warmongering remarks were "appalling." Even the British "Times," which had advocated taking a tough stance against Egypt, blamed Menzies for "ignoring the real situation that is unfavorable to a forcible solution," and that "arbitrarily using force will lead Britain and France into an unjust and tragic war." The "Times" also expressed "surprise" that "the Australian Prime Minister did not mention at all what impact ‘going it alone’ would have on Asian Commonwealth countries."
    Judging from the Australian representative's speech at the Security Council, the Menzies government has still not become any smarter. Today, when Asian countries are closely united under the Bandung Spirit, it actually believes that it can provoke the relationship between Egypt and other Asian and African countries by using the threat that "international capital" may not "flow into underdeveloped countries" because of Egypt's actions. This is clearly another thing that only someone out of touch could think of. (Dan)

    不识时务
    在讨论苏伊士运河问题的安全理事会会议上，澳大利亚的代表用殖民主义者的口吻攻击埃及，并且对所有亚非国家进行恫吓和威胁。在这以前，澳大利亚总理孟席斯曾经在议会发表演说，叫嚣要对埃及进行“制裁”，并且大唱其“使用武力”的好战调子。后来，孟席斯又大嚷要对埃及“施加压力”。
    从苏伊士运河问题发生以来，澳大利亚一直在积极地给殖民主义者充当打手的角色。孟席斯担当了英、法、美三国所策划的“五国委员会”的主席，到埃及去兜售“杜勒斯计划”。可是孟席斯没有能够完成他的不光荣的任务，只好败兴而归。灰溜溜的孟席斯恼怒得很，回国以后不久便对埃及大叫大嚷，一方面出出心头之气，另一方面想给英、法、美三国的武力威胁政策再帮上一下忙。
    但是这一回，孟席斯却未免太不识时务了。现在正是英、法、美在世界舆论的强大压力下不得不少在口头上谈论“和平解决”的时候，孟席斯的叫嚷，却使人更加怀疑英、法、美三国向安全理事会提出苏伊士运河问题的用意。德里的“新印度时报”指出，“孟席斯的言论表明西方……只关心使用武力来达到它们自私的利益。如果它们关心国际的和平的话，那么它们就不会在安理会会议举行以前采取这种战争挑衅的行动。”
    正因为不识时务，孟席斯的叫嚣不但没有得到赏识，反而吃力不讨好，四面挨骂。世界舆论和埃及人民对孟席斯的言论感到愤慨。澳大利亚议会反对党领袖赫伯特·维·伊瓦特说孟席斯的好战言论是“令人悚然”的。就是曾经主张对埃及采取强硬态度的英国“泰晤士报”，也责备孟席斯“忽视了不利于强行解决的真实情况”，而“任意使用武力将会把英、法引导到一个不正当的、悲惨的战争中去。”“泰晤士报”并表示“奇怪”，“澳大利亚总理竟只字不提‘单独干’对亚洲英联邦国家会有什么影响。”
    从澳大利亚代表在安全理事会上的发言看来，孟席斯政府仍然没有变得聪明一点。在亚洲国家紧紧团结在万隆精神之下的今天，它竟然以为用“国际资本”可能因为埃及的行动而不“流入不发达国家”这种恫吓，可以挑拨埃及同其他亚非国家的关系。这显然又是只有不识时务的人才能想出来的玩意儿。　（丹）
