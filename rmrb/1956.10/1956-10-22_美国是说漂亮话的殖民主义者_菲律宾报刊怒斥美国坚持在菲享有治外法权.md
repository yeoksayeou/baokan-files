Xinhua News Agency, October 21st: Manila News - The Philippine press is indignant at the U.S. attitude of still insisting on enjoying extraterritoriality in the Philippines during the U.S.-Philippine negotiations on revising the 1947 Military Bases Agreement.

    The "Manila Chronicle" published an editorial on October 21st saying that the United States announced to the world that they respect the sovereignty of the Philippines and are willing to return the jurisdiction over every inch of Philippine land to the Philippines, but when they are asked to fulfill this beautiful propaganda promise, they would rather be colonialists.

    The U.S.-Philippine negotiations on revising the 1947 Military Bases Agreement began on August 11th this year. The negotiations were interrupted on September 25th due to the U.S. side's insistence on enjoying extraterritoriality in the Philippines. The two sides resumed formal negotiations on October 15th. However, since the United States still insisted on not giving up extraterritoriality, the talks adjourned again on October 17th and are scheduled to resume on October 22nd.

    Philippine representatives participating in the U.S.-Philippine military base negotiations issued a statement on October 20th, accusing the American-run "Manila Daily Bulletin" of publishing provocative remarks, which caused great damage to the negotiations. The American-run newspaper said in an editorial on October 19th that there were serious differences within the Philippine delegation, and a powerful group was "sabotaging" the negotiations because this group resolutely refused to make concessions to the United States on the issue of jurisdiction.

    The Philippine representative's statement said that the "Manila Daily Bulletin's" comments were unreasonable. It said that this editorial created difficulties in solving a troublesome problem. The statement called on all those who report and comment on the negotiations to be responsible.

    菲律宾报刊怒斥美国坚持在菲享有治外法权
    新华社21日讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾报界对于美国在美菲关于修改1947年军事基地协定谈判中仍然坚持要在菲律宾享有治外法权的态度表示愤慨。
      “马尼拉纪事报”在10月21日发表社论说，美国向全世界宣布，他们尊重菲律宾的主权，愿意把菲律宾每一英寸土地上的裁判权还给菲律宾，但是当要他们履行这种漂亮的宣传性的诺言的时候，他们就宁愿成为殖民主义者。
    美菲关于修改1947年军事基地协定的谈判是在今年8月11日开始的。由于美国方面坚持要在菲律宾享有治外法权，谈判在9月25日中断。10月15日起双方又恢复了正式谈判。但是由于美国仍然坚持不肯放弃治外法权，会谈又在10月17日休会，预订在10月22日复会。
    参加美菲军事基地谈判的菲律宾代表在10月20日发表声明，指责美国人办的“马尼拉日报”发表挑拨性的言论，给谈判带来了巨大损害。美国人办的这家报纸在10月19日的一篇社论中说，菲律宾代表团内部有严重分歧，其中一个强有力的集团在“破坏”谈判，因为这个集团坚决不肯在裁判权问题上对美国让步。
    菲律宾代表的声明说，“马尼拉日报”的评论毫无道理。它说，这篇社论给解决一个伤脑筋的问题制造了困难。这个声明要求所有那些报道和评论谈判的人要有责任感。
