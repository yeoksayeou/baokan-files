Xinhua News Agency, 20th. According to a report by Kyodo News Agency reporter Iwatate from Washington, the United States, while outwardly expressing reassurance about the agreement between the Soviet Union and Japan to restore diplomatic relations, is privately dissatisfied.

What dissatisfies the United States is that Hatoyama ignored U.S. "advice" and did not adopt a "persistent attitude" on the territorial issue, thereby allowing the negotiations to reach an agreement. Iwatate pointed out that the United States originally hoped that Japan would delay the entire Soviet-Japanese negotiation on the territorial issue.

Iwatate said that what the United States is particularly afraid of is "what will happen" after the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations. Because the United States believes that, judging from Japan's recent actions, Japan has already regarded adjusting relations with China as the next diplomatic task. The United States is worried that Japan's rapid approach to China and North Korea will affect its so-called "diplomatic strategic system" of maintaining and creating tension in Asia.

Iwatate quoted Washington sources as saying that when Prime Minister Hatoyama arrives in the United States on his way home from the Soviet Union, "the official atmosphere in the United States will not be warm."

United Press International had already revealed yesterday the U.S. attempt to obstruct the normalization of Japanese-Chinese relations. It said that Washington will "closely watch" Japan's method and manner of handling the China issue. If Japan takes any "overly hasty" actions in restoring normal relations with China, the United States will definitely intervene directly.

    美国方面对苏日达成协议感到不满  特别害怕因此促进中日关系正常化
    新华社20日讯　据共同社记者岩立从华盛顿发出的消息说，美国对苏日两国恢复邦交的协议虽然外表上表示安心，但在私下里却感到不满。
    美国方面感到不满的是，鸠山忽视了美国的“劝告”，没有在领土问题上采取“坚持态度”，而使谈判达成了协议。岩立指出，美国原来希望日本在领土问题上拖延整个日苏谈判。
    岩立说，美国特别害怕的是日苏关系正常化以后“将要发生的事情”。因为美国认为，从日本最近的动向来看，日本已经把调整同中国之间的关系当作了外交上的下一个课题。美国担心日本迅速地接近中国和北朝鲜会影响它在亚洲保持和制造紧张局势的所谓“外交战略体系”。
    岩立援引华盛顿人士的话指出，当鸠山首相从苏联回国途中到达美国的时候，“美国官方的空气不会是温暖的”。
    美国国际新闻社在昨天已经透露出美国企图阻挠日中关系正常化的态度。它说，华盛顿将“十分密切地注视”日本处理中国问题的办法和方式。万一日本在同中国恢复正常关系方面采取任何“过急”的行动时，美国肯定地将直接进行干涉。
