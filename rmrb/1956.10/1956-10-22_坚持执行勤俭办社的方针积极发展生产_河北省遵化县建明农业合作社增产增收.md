    Adhere to the Policy of Running the Commune Diligently and Thriftily, Actively Develop Production
    Jianming Agricultural Cooperative in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, Increases Production and Income
    (Our Newspaper News) Jianming Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative (formerly Wang Guofan Agricultural Cooperative) in Xisishilipu Township, Zunhua County, Hebei Province, has continued to implement the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily and actively develop production since it was transformed into a higher-level cooperative in January this year. The cooperative has achieved an all-round bumper harvest of various crops. It is estimated that the average yield of grain crops per mu is 486 jin, exceeding the 305 jin per mu of the original Wang Guofan Primary Cooperative in 1955 by 60%, and increasing three times compared with the 120 jin per mu in 1952 before the organization was formed. Among them, 65 mu of high-yield sorghum is expected to produce 1,000 jin per mu; 35 mu of high-yield corn, more than 1,400 jin per mu; 85 mu of direct-seeded sweet potatoes can produce 10,000 jin per mu. It is estimated that the total income of the cooperative from agriculture, animal husbandry, fruit trees, forestry, and sideline occupations will be more than 300,000 yuan, and each workday can be distributed 3.4 yuan. A total of 549 households in the cooperative, 533 households have increased their income compared with 1955, accounting for 97% of the total number of households. Among them, 470 households have increased their income by more than double, accounting for 86% of the total number of households. The 16 households with reduced income, accounting for 3% of the total number of households, have been taken care of and subsidized according to their respective situations.
    Jianming Agricultural Cooperative is known throughout the country for running the commune diligently and thriftily. After being transformed into a higher-level cooperative, they criticized various erroneous ideas and continued to maintain this glorious tradition. At the beginning of the transformation, like some other cooperatives, some people, under the pretext of engaging in large-scale production, advocated "everything should look like something"; they were unwilling to accept the 105 private donkeys of the members, advocating exchanging them for large mules and horses; they advocated selling iron-wheeled carts and exchanging them for rubber-tired carts; they advocated abandoning old farm tools and using all new farm tools; they advocated replacing all the livestock halters, reins, and all furniture with "all-new ones". In response to this situation, the cooperative vigorously carried out education on running the commune diligently and thriftily, put forward the slogan of "continuing to run the commune diligently and thriftily," unified thinking through detailed accounting, and formed practical actions. As a result, they achieved increased production and income in the first year of establishing the higher-level cooperative.
    In order to strive for a greater harvest next year, all members of the cooperative are now carrying out a large-scale manure accumulation campaign. The entire cooperative plans to accumulate more than 120 million jin of manure, striving to apply 16,000 jin of fertilizer per mu next year.

    坚持执行勤俭办社的方针积极发展生产
    河北省遵化县建明农业合作社增产增收
    本报讯　河北省遵化县西四十里铺乡建明农林牧业生产合作社（原王国藩农业社），自从今年1月转为高级社以后，继续贯彻执行勤俭办社的方针，积极发展生产，全社各种农作物获得全面丰收。预计粮食作物平均每亩产四百八十六斤，超过原王国藩初级社1955年每亩三百零五斤的60％，比1952年没组织起来时亩产一百二十斤增加了三倍。其中六十五亩丰产高粱，预计每亩产一千斤；三十五亩丰产玉米，每亩一千四百多斤；八十五亩直播白薯，每亩能产一万斤，全社预计农业、畜牧、果树、林业、副业收入三十余万元，每个劳动日可分到三元四角。全社共五百四十九户，有五百三十三户比1955年增加收入，占总户数的97％。其中增加收入一倍以上的四百七十户，占总户数86％。减少收入的十六户，占总户数3％。对于减少收入的户，分别情况进行了照顾和补助。
    建明农业社是以勤俭办社闻名全国的。在转为高级社以后，他们批判了各种错误思想，继续保持了这一光荣传统。在转社之初，也和其他一些合作社一样，有些人借口搞大生产，主张“处处要像个样子”；对于社员私有的一百零五头毛驴不愿接收，主张换回大骡大马；主张卖掉铁轮车，换回胶皮车；主张废弃旧农具，全用新式农具；主张把牲口笼头，使用的缰绳及一切家具，全换上“一色新”。针对这种情况，社内大力进行了勤俭办社教育，提出“继续勤俭办社”的口号，经过算细账，统一了思想，并形成了实际行动，因而在建立高级社的第一年便获得了增产增收的成绩。
    为了争取明年更大的丰收，现在全社社员开展了大规模的积肥运动，全社计划积肥一亿二千多万斤，争取明年每亩施肥一万六千斤。
