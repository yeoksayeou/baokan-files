    Central Stores Universally Established in Vast Rural Areas of Anhui
    (Xinhua News Agency) By the beginning of September, the Anhui Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative had established 1,199 central stores in the rural areas of the province, responsible for contacting small vendors. They have already helped local small vendors organize 1,292 cooperative groups. A total of 13,498 households and 14,199 people participated in the cooperative groups.
    The central stores in various places have also taken various measures according to the urgent needs of small vendors to help them overcome difficulties in taxation, loans, and sources of goods. By the end of August, small vendors throughout the province (including some cooperative stores with financial difficulties) had received loans of approximately 2.3 million yuan.
    Now, supply and marketing cooperatives, joint-venture stores, and cooperative stores in various places have successively released some small groceries, small general merchandise, and other sporadic commodities for small vendors to operate. In addition, in order to help small vendors expand their operations and increase their income, central stores in many areas organize small vendors to purchase goods from other places.
    Now, the turnover of small vendors in various places has increased to varying degrees. In Xin Dianbu, Huoqiu County, the turnover of 13 small vendors in the first half of August increased by 23.5% compared with the first half of July.

    安徽广大农村普遍建立中心商店
    新华社讯　到九月上旬为止，安徽省供销合作社已经在全省农村中建立了一千一百九十九个负责同小商贩联系的中心商店。它们已经帮助各地小商贩组织了一千二百九十二个合作小组。参加合作小组的小商贩共有一万三千四百九十八户，一万四千一百九十九人。
    各地中心商店还根据小商贩的迫切需要采取了各种措施，帮助他们克服纳税、贷款及货源等方面的困难。到8月底为止，全省小商贩（包括部分资金困难的合作商店）得到贷款约二百三十万元。
    现在各地供销社、合营商店、合作商店已经陆续让出一些小杂货、小百货等零星商品，给小商贩经营。此外，为了帮助小商贩扩大经营，增加收入，很多地区的中心商店组织小商贩向外地进货。
    现在各地小商贩的营业额都有不同程度的上升。霍丘县新店埠十三户小商贩八月上半月的营业额比七月上半月上升了23.5％。
