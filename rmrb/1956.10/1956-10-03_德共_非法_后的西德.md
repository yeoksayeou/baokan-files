In West Germany, the development of the political situation after the German Communist Party (DKP) was declared "illegal" has not been in line with what the Adenauer group had originally imagined. The pro-American group had originally attempted to strengthen its position through this action, but this has not been the case. The political situation in West Germany continues to develop in a direction unfavorable to the pro-American faction.

Adenauer's banning of the DKP has been condemned by progressive public opinion throughout Germany and the world. People compared Adenauer's rule to the Hitler regime of the past. This fascist-style police terror has also caused extreme unease among West Germany's neighbors, especially France and Italy. Memories of the era of the German Nazi army occupation resurfaced in people's minds. Those concerned about peace and the democratic reunification of Germany believe that the verdict declaring the DKP illegal is tantamount to blocking the path to all-German negotiations and all-German elections, adding another obstacle to German reunification.

Under the criticism of progressive public opinion at home and abroad, obvious differences have emerged among West German bourgeois figures regarding the issue of banning the DKP. Many West German bourgeois newspapers used large headlines the day after the verdict, such as: "Political figures express concern about the consequences of the Constitutional Court's verdict," "Western European countries express doubt," "Paris warns Bonn: Don't tie your own hands," "Western press warns: Don't make a political blunder," "DKP ban raises difficult legal questions – states disagree on the handling of DKP members' qualifications in township councils!"…

The West German bourgeois newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau" believes that, "What factual basis is there for declaring a party that was recognized as a democratic party and granted legal status by the four occupying powers in 1945 to be unconstitutional now? The task of the court should not be to deal with issues of political thought. … If it is declared illegal on the grounds of Marxism-Leninism, then when it was registered in 1945 and when the West German constitution was adopted in 1949, the Communist Party's Marxist-Leninist theoretical foundation was already known to the public and the West German authorities; and from then until now, it has always been recognized as a democratic party. … Therefore, this verdict lacks a legal basis, and this verdict will only reduce the credibility of the Bonn government, which has stubbornly insisted on declaring the DKP illegal for the past five years." Mund, vice chairman of the West German Free Democratic Party, publicly stated: This ban will cause West Germany to lose its moral arguments in discussions on the all-German issue. Many West German bourgeois figures believe that the German Communist Party may gain greater influence and greater appeal among the masses in underground activities than in open activities.

Amid public condemnation, even leading figures of Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union dare not express opinions on the political wisdom or lack thereof of this ban, or on its tactical correctness, and evade directly answering such questions raised by West German bourgeois newspaper reporters.

Declaring the DKP illegal also cannot reduce the neutralist sentiment among the West German people. The movement against militarism, against war preparations, and demanding peaceful reunification continues to develop. The result of a recent public opinion poll conducted by a public opinion research institute in Düsseldorf, the capital of the Ruhr region of West Germany, among 2,000 residents of various professions in West Germany is: 66% oppose forming a one-sided group with Western countries; of which 27% explicitly advocate the neutralization of Germany, and 39% advocate that West Germany conclude security treaties with both "East and West." Only 21% agree to form a group with Western countries. The result of a recent survey by another West German public opinion research institute is: Only 20% of West German men are willing to wear military uniforms, and 76% oppose wearing military uniforms. Among men aged thirty to fifty who had participated in the war, the most opposed to wearing military uniforms again. The number of members of the War Resisters' International Association continues to increase. This association has recently established consulting offices in Hanover, Dortmund, Frankfurt and other places to provide legal advice to young people who refuse to perform military service. The number of officially registered members in the association has already reached tens of thousands. The people's movement against atomic weapons in West Germany continues to unfold.

The history of the development of the German working class movement has repeatedly proven that police terror cannot eliminate the Marxist party rooted in the German working class. This time, the Adenauer government has once again adopted the old trick of police terror to deal with the German Communist Party. However, the pro-American forces in West Germany cannot sever the ties between the DKP and the broad masses of the West German people. The underground edition of the DKP's central organ "Freies Volk" has been published and continues to circulate among the masses of the West German people. The underground "German Freedom Radio Station" has started broadcasting again, disseminating the German Communist Party's propositions to West German residents.

Under the insistence of West German workers, the Bonn authorities have had to agree that DKP members of the enterprise committees in many West German factories retain their committee qualifications. Although the state parliaments of West Germany, in accordance with the court's verdict, deprived DKP members of parliament of their qualifications, several state governments in the seven major states of West Germany have had to decide to retain the qualifications of DKP members of parliament in township and county councils due to the support of township residents for the DKP. The state government of Baden-Württemberg has formally decided: The qualifications of the state's 94 DKP township parliamentarians and 20 county parliamentarians will remain valid in the future. The state governments of Lower Saxony and Hesse have also made the same decision. The state governments of Rhineland-Palatinate and Bavaria are also very inclined to retain the qualifications of DKP township parliamentarians and county parliamentarians.

Although the German Communist Party is now declared illegal by the West German authorities, the DKP's political influence in West Germany still exists and will continue to expand. The DKP and the masses of the West German people continue to maintain close ties. The DKP remains the most resolute force in the West German people's movement to strive for Germany's reunification on the basis of peace and democracy. The German people earnestly hope for the reunification of their motherland and the maintenance of world peace. A handful of Adenauer group members cannot long resist the powerful tide of the vast German people demanding peaceful reunification.

    德共“非法”后的西德
    何疆
    德共被宣布为“非法”后，西德政局发展的情况，并不符合阿登纳集团原先所想像的那样。亲美集团本来企图用这种行为来增强自己的地位，但是结果并未如此。西德政治形势继续朝着不利于亲美派的方向在发展。
    阿登纳集团取缔德共的行为受到全德国和全世界进步舆论的谴责。人们把阿登纳的统治同昔日德国的希特勒统治相比拟。这种法西斯式的警察恐怖，还引起了西德的邻国，尤其是法、意等国的极度不安。人们的脑海里重新浮起了关于希特勒德国军队占领时代的回忆。关心和平和德国民主统一的人都认为，宣布德共非法的判决无异是杜绝全德谈判和全德选举的道路，给德国统一增添了一重障碍。
    在国内和国外的进步舆论的指责之下，西德资产阶级人士间在取缔德共问题上也出现了明显的分歧。西德不少资产阶级报纸在宣判后的第二天就用大字排出诸如此类的标题：“政界人士对宪法法院判决的后果表示忧虑”、“西欧各国表示怀疑”、“巴黎警告波恩：勿作茧自缚”、“西方报界警告：勿作出政治上的蠢举”、“德共禁令引起困难的法律问题——各州对乡镇议会德共议员资格的处理不一致！”……。
    西德资产阶级报纸“法兰克福评论报”认为是，“1945年被四个占领国认为是民主党派而给予合法地位的政党，现在有什么事实根据又被宣布为违背宪法的呢？法院的任务不应该是处理政治思想问题。……如果以马克思列宁主义为理由而宣布非法，那末在1945年登记成立时和1949年通过西德宪法时，共产党的马克思列宁主义学说基础早已为公众和西德当局所知晓；而且从当时到现在它一直是被公认的民主政党。……所以这次判决是缺乏法律根据的，这种判决只会使那五年来一意孤行地坚持要宣布德共非法的波恩政府的威信下降”。西德自由民主党副主席蒙德公开声明：这次禁令将使西德在全德问题的讨论中丧失道义上的论据。西德不少资产阶级人士认为，德国共产党在地下活动中可能出乎政府意料地获得比公开活动更大的影响，在群众中有更大的号召力。
    在公众的纷纷责难之下，甚至连阿登纳的基督教民主联盟的领导人物都不敢就这次禁令在政治上的智与不智问题以及在策略上的正确与否问题表示意见，规避正面答复西德资产阶级报纸记者所提出的这一类的问题。
    宣布德共为非法也不能减退西德人民群众间的中立主义情绪。反对军国主义、反对备战和要求和平统一的运动仍然在发展。西德鲁尔区首府杜塞尔多夫市一个民意研究所最近在西德各种职业的居民二千人里所作的民意调查的结果是：66％反对同西方国家结成片面的集团；其中27％明确地主张德国中立化，39％主张西德同“东方和西方”都缔结安全公约。只有21％同意和西方国家结成集团。西德另一个民意研究所最近调查的结果是：西德男子里只有20％愿意穿军服，76％反对穿军服。曾经参加过战争的三十到五十岁的男子中，反对再穿军服的人最多。反对服兵役者国际协会的成员依然在增加。这个协会最近已经在汉诺威、多特蒙德、法兰克福等地成立顾问处，替那些拒绝服兵役的青年提供法律上的咨询意见。协会里已登记的正式会员数已经上万。西德反对原子武器的人民运动还继续在展开。
    德国工人阶级运动发展的历史已经一再证明，警察恐怖决不能消灭生根于德国工人阶级的马克思主义政党。这一次阿登纳政府又采用警察恐怖的老手法来对付德国共产党。但是西德的亲美势力并不能切断德共和西德广大人民群众的联系。德共的中央机关报“自由人民报”的地下版已经出刊，继续在西德人民群众间传布。地下的“德国自由广播电台”已经又开始广播，向西德居民传播德国共产党的主张。
    在西德工人的坚持之下，波恩当局不得不同意西德许多工厂的企业委员会里的德共委员仍然保留他们的委员资格。虽然西德各州州议会依照法院的判决剥夺了德共议员的资格，但是由于乡镇居民对德共的支持，西德的七个大州里已经有几个州政府不得不决定仍然保留乡镇议会和县议会里德共议员的资格。巴登—符腾堡州的州政府已正式决定：该州德共九十四名乡镇议员和二十名县议员的资格今后仍旧有效。下萨克森和黑森这两州的州政府也已作出同样的决定。莱因—巴拉丁纳特州和巴伐利亚州的州政府也很倾向于保留德共乡镇议员和县议员的资格。
    德国共产党现在虽然被西德当局宣布非法，但德共在西德的政治影响仍然存在并且还要继续扩大。德共和西德人民群众继续保持着紧密的联系。德共依然是争取德国在和平民主基础上重归统一的西德人民运动的最坚决的力量。德国人民殷切地希望祖国统一和维持世界和平。一小撮的阿登纳集团分子是不可能长久抵挡住德国广大人民要求和平统一的强大潮流的。
