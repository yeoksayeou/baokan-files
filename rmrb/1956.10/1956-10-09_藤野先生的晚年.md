　　Mr. Fujino's Later Years
  　Zhang Baoshen
    In the famous "tiger's tail" at Lu Xun's former residence in Beijing, there is a photograph of a Japanese man hanging on the wall. This is Mr. Fujino. Lu Xun wrote: "Whenever I was tired at night and wanted to be lazy, I would look up and catch a glimpse of his dark and thin face in the lamplight, as if he was about to speak in measured tones, which would suddenly make my conscience prick and give me more courage. So I would light a cigarette and continue to write words that were deeply loathed by the 'gentlemen' class." It is clear that Lu Xun greatly cherished the benefits he received from Mr. Fujino. When the "Lu Xun Selected Works" were compiled and published in the "Iwanami Bunko" edition in Japan in 1935, Lu Xun told the translators Sato Haruo and Masuda Wataru that "Mr. Fujino" from "Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk" must be included. The year after the "Lu Xun Selected Works" were published in Japan, the translator Masuda Wataru visited Lu Xun in Shanghai. Lu Xun asked him about Mr. Fujino's recent situation. When Masuda Wataru said that he had no information, Lu Xun said with emotion: "Mr. Fujino is probably no longer alive!" He originally thought that the publication of the "Lu Xun Selected Works" in Japan would bring news of Mr. Fujino. However, this expectation was not fulfilled. What was Mr. Fujino's later life like? This is not only what Lu Xun missed during his lifetime, but also what our readers are extremely concerned about. It is said that after Lu Xun's death, a Chinese visitor went to see Mr. Fujino and wrote a piece of visitation record that was published in "Zhongliu," published in Shanghai before the war. Recently, there have been many articles about "Mr. Fujino" in various Japanese newspapers and periodicals. Moreover, Mr. Fujino Tsunemichi, the grandson of Mr. Fujino's eldest brother, also wrote a "Short Biography of Mr. Fujino," which was published in the fourth issue of the Japanese "Chinese Literature News" this year. This gives us the opportunity to know something about the later life of this respectable old man.
    In 1915, Sendai Medical College was changed to Medical University. Mr. Fujino only graduated from Aichi Medical School. Although he was knowledgeable, he was not qualified to teach in the university due to his lack of qualifications, not having attended a regular university, and not having a degree, so he left his job. After leaving Sendai, he worked at the Izumi Bridge Charity Hospital in Tokyo for a year, and then returned to his hometown of Fukui City to start his own business.
    In fact, Mr. Fujino saw "Mr. Fujino" written by Lu Xun. That was three years after the "Lu Xun Selected Works" were published in Japan.
    When Mr. Fujino's eldest son was studying at the Fourth High School, the school's Japanese language teacher discovered that the student's father was Fujino Kyuro, and asked: "Is your father Mr. Fujino from Sendai Medical College?" In this way, the "Lu Xun Selected Works" finally reached Mr. Fujino's hands. He put on his glasses and hurriedly opened the "Lu Xun Selected Works." When he saw Lu Xun's photo on the title page, he exclaimed with joy: "Ah! This is Zhou Jun, he is already remarkable!" He was very happy to know that Lu Xun was still alive.
    Mr. Fujino's later life was not good. The old man devoted all his energy and hope to his two sons. Unfortunately, during the war, the eldest son was forcibly enlisted into the army by the militarists and died in battle; the second son also left the old man and entered the Naval Academy. This caused great mental shock to the old man. After sending away his two sons, the lonely old man rented a house in Honjo Village and opened a small clinic. Every day, he worked hard, traveling back and forth from home by train. As a rural doctor, Mr. Fujino was very loyal to his duties and deeply concerned and loved by the farmers.
    On August 11, 1945, a few days before the surrender of Japanese imperialism, Mr. Fujino, at the age of seventy-two, died of cerebral hemorrhage. Before his death, the old man only said one sentence: "When burying me, please put on my professor's uniform." Only his wife was by his side when the old man died. The next day, under the air raid of American B29 planes, the funeral was held bleakly.

　　藤野先生的晚年
  　张葆莘
    在北京鲁迅故居那有名的“老虎尾巴”里，墙壁上挂着一位日本人的照片，他就是藤野先生。鲁迅先生写道：“每当夜间疲倦，正想偷懒时，仰面在灯光中瞥见他黑瘦的面貌，似乎正要说出抑扬顿挫的话来，便使我忽又良心发现，而且增加勇气了，于是点上一支烟，再继续写些为‘正人君子’之流所深恶痛疾的文字。”可见，鲁迅是非常珍惜藤野先生对他的教益的。1935年日本“岩波文库”版的“鲁迅选集”编印时，鲁迅曾对译者佐藤春夫和增田涉说，一定要将“朝华夕拾”里的“藤野先生”收进去。“鲁迅选集”在日本出版后的第二年，译者增田涉到上海访问鲁迅。鲁迅向他打听藤野先生的近况，当增田涉说没有下落时，鲁迅感慨地说：“藤野先生大概已经不在世了吧！”他本来以为“鲁迅选集”在日本出版，会得到藤野先生的消息。但是，这一期望落空了。藤野先生的晚年究竟怎样，这不只是鲁迅生前所怀念的，也是我们读者所异常关心的。据说，鲁迅死后，有个中国访问者曾去看过藤野先生，回来写了篇访问记登在战前上海出版的“中流”上。最近，日本曾经有很多关于“藤野先生”的文章散见于各报刊。而且藤野先生长兄的孙子藤野恒道先生还撰写一篇“藤野先生小传”，发表在日本的“中国文学报”今年第四期上。这就使我们有机会知道一些关于这位可敬的老人晚年的景况。
    1915年，仙台医学专科学校改为医科大学。藤野先生只是爱知医学校毕业，尽管他的学识渊博，但终因资历不够，没有入过正规大学，没有学位，不能在大学里任教而离职了。他离开仙台后，到东京泉桥慈善医院工作了一年，就回到家乡福井市自己开业了。
    事实上，藤野先生是看到鲁迅所写的“藤野先生”的。那是“鲁迅选集”在日本出版后第三年的事。
    藤野先生的长子入第四高等学校读书时，学校里的国语教师发现这位学生的父亲就是藤野严九郎，便问道：“你父亲就是仙台医专的藤野先生吧！”这样，“鲁迅选集”终于到了藤野先生的手里。他戴上眼镜，匆忙地将“鲁迅选集”翻开，当他看到扉页上鲁迅的照片时，惊喜地高声叫道：“啊！这是周君，他已经了不起啦！”他知道鲁迅仍然健在，感到非常高兴。
    藤野先生晚年的境遇很不好。老人将自己的全付精力和所有的希望都倾注、寄托在两个儿子的身上了。但不幸，在战时，长子被军国主义者强征入伍，战死了；次子也远离老人，进入了海军士官学校。这使老人在精神上受到了很大的打击。孤单的老人，送走了两个儿子之后，在本庄村租了一所房子，开设爿小小的诊疗所。每天辛辛苦苦地从家里乘电车往返。作为一个乡村医生，藤野先生非常忠于职责，深为农民所关切、热爱。
    1945年8月11日，日本帝国主义投降前的几天，藤野先生以七十二岁的高龄，患了脑溢血，与世长辞了。临死之前，老人只说一句话：“埋葬的时候，要替我穿上教授的制服。”老人临终时，只有夫人一人在侧。第二天，在美国B29型飞机的空袭下，凄凉地举行了葬仪。
