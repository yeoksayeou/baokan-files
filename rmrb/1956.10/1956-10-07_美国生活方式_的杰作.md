    A Masterpiece of the "American Way of Life"
    The American Columbia Pictures' so-called most popular and so-called "youthful vitality" erotic frenzy song and dance film "Rock Around the Clock," recently caused a huge commotion when it was shown in Britain and other countries.
    This film intersperses decadent love stories, using a band playing the most intensely stimulating American dance music and the vulgar "Rock Around the Clock" dance that frantically throws people around from head to crotch, to stir up the audience's hysterical frenzy and impulsiveness. As a result, after the film was shown in a London cinema, groups of young viewers gathered in the square in front of the cinema, singing and dancing wildly, banging on the doors, jumping on car roofs, throwing bottles, and setting off firecrackers, causing a traffic jam and chaos. The police department had to send a large number of police and police dogs to suppress the riot and arrested twenty-four young people. At the same time, similar disturbances occurred during screenings at two other cinemas in London, and thirteen young viewers were arrested by the police.
    In Manchester, "Rock Around the Clock" caused many viewers to riot in the theater, singing, dancing wildly, throwing light bulbs and burning cigarette butts, and even taking out the fire hose and spraying water everywhere. In Lancashire, more than a thousand young people sang loudly along the way after watching the film, and the police, fearing trouble, had to escort them home.
    These serious disturbances shook the British Isles, and the councils of thirteen large towns in Britain have ordered the film to be banned. However, the American "New York Times" tried to defend the film by quoting a passage from a British newspaper, which surprisingly argued that the film should not be banned, but that these "sabotage groups" should be suppressed. According to this, it seems that the irrational and mad behavior of the British young viewers was not due to the influence of the film, but to the instigation of so-called "sabotage groups."
    However, this sophistry cannot explain why this film has caused the same trouble in other countries, including the United States. For example, according to the "New York Times," after a screening of "Rock Around the Clock" at a cinema in New York, many young people danced wildly on the main streets and vandalized shops. It was also reported that when Elvis Presley, known as the "King of Rock and Roll," performed in Kansas City, a large group of girls rushed onto the stage to inflict "violence" on him because "his loud voice was like the mating call of beasts in the forest." Were these disturbances also instigated by "sabotage groups"?
    The "New York Times" has previously admitted that films and jazz music are American "cold war" propaganda tools "with potential effects" and that they have "great appeal" in Europe. Therefore, if there are "sabotage groups," it is precisely the American "cold war" headquarters that promotes the decadent "American way of life" and corrupts countless young people, not anyone else.

### “美国生活方式”的杰作

    “美国生活方式”的杰作
    美国哥伦比亚影片公司摄制的号称美国目前最流行、最充满所谓“青春活力”的色情狂歌舞片“阿飞舞”，最近在英国和其他国家放映时引起了巨大的骚动。
    这部电影穿插着糜烂的恋爱故事，以一个乐队演奏美国最富有强烈的刺激性的舞曲和像发疯似地把人从头上和胯下甩来甩去的恶俗的“阿飞舞”，来煽起观众歇斯底里的狂热和冲动。结果在伦敦一家电影院放映后，一个个青年观众聚集在电影院前广场上大唱大跳，轰打大门，跳上汽车顶扔瓶子和放鞭炮，交通顿告阻塞，秩序大乱。警察局不得不派了大批警察和警犬进行弹压，逮捕了二十四个青年。同时，在伦敦其他两家电影院的放映也发生了同样的骚动，青年观众被警察抓去了十三名。
    在曼彻斯特，“阿飞舞”使许多观众在戏院里就大闹起来，胡唱乱跳，乱丢电灯泡和烧着的香烟头，还把救火龙头拿出来乱浇。在兰开夏郡一千多名青年看了该片后，沿路高唱，警察怕出乱子，只得护送他们回家。
    这些严重的骚动震动了英伦三岛，英国十三个大的城镇议会已下令禁止上演这部电影。但是美国“纽约时报”却想引用英国一家报纸的一段话来为这部电影辩解，这家英国报纸竟认为不应该禁止这部电影上映，但是要取缔这些“破坏集团”。照这样说来，好像英国青年观众丧失理性的疯狂行为，不是由于受了这部电影的影响，而是因为有所谓“破坏集团”的煽动。
    但是，这种诡辩不能解释为什么这部影片在其他国家包括美国在内也闯了同样的乱子。例如据“纽约时报”报道：纽约一家电影院放映“阿飞舞”后，许多青年在通衢大道上狂舞，并破坏商店。另据报道，被称为“阿飞舞”之王的普里士在堪萨斯市表演时，竟然使一大群少女拥上舞台要对他施加“暴行”，因为“他那种响亮的声音，简直有如森林中兽类求偶声”。难道这些骚动也是“破坏集团”所煽动的吗？
    “纽约时报”在以前已经承认过，电影和爵士音乐是美国“具有潜在效果”的“冷战”宣传工具，这在欧洲已有“很大的吸引力”。因此，如果有“破坏集团”的话，那正是推广腐朽的“美国生活方式”、使无数青年腐化堕落的美国“冷战”参谋部自己，而不是任何别人。
