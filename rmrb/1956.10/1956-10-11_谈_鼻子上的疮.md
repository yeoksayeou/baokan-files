Talking about "The Sore on the Nose"
申言

When criticizing, one should consider the critic and also the criticized. On September 3rd, the supplement of the People's Daily had a short article discussing "The 'Surface' of 'Comprehensive'". I think it lacked a little consideration for the criticized. Let's take the sore on someone A's nose as an example. "If someone B only criticizes someone A's nose, saying how bad the sore on this nose is," even if the boundary of criticism is reached, such criticism seems unnecessary. Because having a sore on the nose, bleeding and oozing pus, is naturally uncomfortable, and the nose is certainly not satisfied with this annoying sore, so it doesn't deserve criticism. Saying "how bad the sore is" is also common knowledge. If this nose said, "This sore is growing really well," it would indicate that it either has a mental problem or is ideologically stubborn.

Someone B's purpose in criticizing is undoubtedly to "treat the sore and save the nose." Then, not only criticize and draw a line, but it is best to tell someone A what kind of sore it is and how to treat it. If it's a furuncle, one should remind someone A to pay attention, otherwise, if it is not eradicated quickly, not only the nose but also the eyes, face, and even the brain nerves will suffer. In this way, someone A will accept someone B's suggestions or criticisms with gratitude.

Looking at things comprehensively means looking at the positive and negative sides, the part and the whole, the past and the future. Comparing the two sides will naturally be comprehensive. As for how big the boundary of criticism should be, I think it doesn't lie in the size of the "surface" in form, but in the limit, or rather, the "conditions" needed to "treat the sore and save the nose." Criticism for the sake of criticism often provokes resentment from the criticized and is suspected of being "crude criticism," which is also deserved.

Take the example of a textile worker with poor production. If her production declines and does not meet the quota, it is unrealistic to only criticize her hands, or even extend the criticism to her whole body. To trace the root cause, talk to her, and perhaps visit her home. Has her husband been arguing with her these past few days, causing her to be restless? Or is she taking care of a sick child at home, not getting enough sleep, or are there other reasons? Help her solve these root causes that hinder production. This is precisely why Party workers in factories and mines emphasize the method of individual treatment. Only criticizing her hands, her whole body, even her husband and children, no matter how big the "surface" is, is not what she needs. Because declining production and reduced income are also not in her favor.

However, today, whether in factories and mines, in government offices, or in academia, there is no shortage of critics who seize on one point and criticize loudly and indiscriminately. These critics are probably limited by the "surface" and do not understand the "surface" comprehensively enough.

    谈“鼻子上的疮”
    申言
    在批评问题上，替批评者设想，也要替被批评者设想。9月3日，人民日报副刊有篇短文谈“‘全面’的‘面’”，我看，替被批评者设想的少了一点。也拿某甲的鼻子上长的那颗疮为例。“如果某乙只是批评某甲的鼻子，说是这只鼻子上的疮如何不好”。就算达到了批评的界限，这样的批评，似乎是不必要的。因为，鼻子长颗疮，流血流脓，自然不舒坦，鼻子当然不满意这颗讨厌的疮，犯得上挨批评。说“疮如何不好”，这也是尽人皆知的。若是这只鼻子说：“这颗疮长的真乖。”这说明它不是有神经病，就是思想顽固。
    某乙批评的目的，无疑地是想“治疮救鼻子”。那末，不光是批评，划个界限，最好是告诉某甲，这是颗什么疮，怎样治疗。若是颗疔疮呢，应当提醒某甲注意，要不赶快根除它，别说鼻子，连眼睛、脸、甚至脑神经也要遭殃。这样，某甲会怀着感激的心情，接受某乙的建议或批评。
    看事物要全面，不外是看正面和反面；看局部和整体；看过去和将来。把两面比较一下，自然全面了。批评的界限，究竟应当有多大，我认为倒不在“面”的形式大小，而在于“治疮救鼻子”所需要的限度，或者说“条件”。为了批评的批评，往往会惹起被批评者的反感，受到“粗暴批评”之嫌，也是理有应得。
    举个生产不好的纺织女工为例，她的生产下降，达不到定额，单批评她那一双手，甚至扩大到她的全身，都是不切实际的。要追查根源，跟她谈谈，无妨去她家里看看。这几天，是她的丈夫跟她闹别扭，弄得她心神不安呢？还是在家里照顾生病的娃娃，睡眠不足，或者是有其他原因，帮助她解决这些妨碍生产的根源。厂矿党的工作者，所以强调个别对待的方法，正是如此。单批评她的手，她的全身，直到她的丈夫、娃娃，无论“面”有多大，都不是她所需要的。因为，生产下降，收入减少，也不是于她有利的事情。
    可是，今天，无论在厂矿企业、在机关、在学术界，抓住一点，不分青红皂白，大喊大叫的批评家，倒是不乏其人呢。这些批评家，大概是受了“面”的限制，对“面”理解得不够“全面”而已。
