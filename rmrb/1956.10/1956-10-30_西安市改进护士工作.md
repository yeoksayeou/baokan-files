Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, October 29th: More than twenty hospitals in Xi'an are taking steps to address existing problems in nursing work.

Currently, some units have made relatively clear regulations regarding the scope of nurses' responsibilities, reducing some administrative work for nurses and allowing them more time for technical operations. Some hospitals have also made appropriate adjustments to the work arrangements for a small number of nurses whose workloads were not appropriately distributed or were too heavy. All hospitals have also begun to pay attention to nurses' learning. The Xi'an Fifth Hospital has made a comprehensive plan for nurses' learning and has begun to adopt a method of departmental learning. In departments with many nurses, physicians in each department will systematically lecture nurses on a regular basis. The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Medical College plans to transfer some nursing staff who have not undergone systematic professional and technical training to relevant schools or training courses for further study.

    西安市改进护士工作
    据新华社西安29日电　西安市二十多个医院正着手解决护士工作中存在的问题。
    现在，有些单位已经把护士的职责范围作了比较明确的规定，减少了护士工作中某些事务工作，使他们有较多的时间进行技术性的操作。有的医院对少数工作安排不够妥当或工作负担较重的护士也作了适当的调整。各医院也都开始注意了护士的学习问题。西安市第五医院对护士的学习作了全面规划，并已开始采取分科学习的办法，护士多的科室，由各科室医师定期系统地向护士授课。西安医学院第二附属医院准备抽调一部分没有经过系统的业务技术学习的护理人员，送到有关学校或训练班进修。
