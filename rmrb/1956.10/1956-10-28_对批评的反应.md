	Reactions to Criticism

	Chang Le Toothpaste Quality to be Improved

	Letter from the Local State-Owned Jilin Daily Chemical Factory: The criticism in the People's Daily article "Chang Le Toothpaste Easily Spoils," published on September 12, is correct. The decline in the quality of Chang Le toothpaste is mainly due to the fact that since June 1955, in order to meet users' requirements for more foam and a special fragrance, our factory rashly changed the technical formula, causing the toothpaste to crack, leak, and spoil.

	At the end of 1955, our factory discovered this problem and organized technical personnel to conduct research and analysis. This year, we organized another group of personnel to study at brother factories in Shanghai and Guangzhou. Now, a new technical formula has been successfully developed and is awaiting approval from the Provincial Department of Industry before production can begin.

	Ministry of Metallurgical Industry Supports Newspaper Criticism

	This newspaper published an article on July 18, "Why Borrow and Not Repay," criticizing the Sixth Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation of the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry for not executing labor borrowing contracts; on July 19, it published an article "Sneaky Recruiters," criticizing the First and Second Companies of the Pipeline Installation Corporation of the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry for privately recruiting workers; on July 20, it published an article "An Advanced Unit Subjected to All Kinds of Obstruction," criticizing the First Construction Engineering Company of the Baotou Branch of the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company for not supporting advanced units. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry attached great importance to these criticisms and telegraphed the criticized units on July 20 and 21 respectively, ordering them to quickly and seriously conduct inspections and to reply to this newspaper with the inspection results within a time limit.

	Why are "Forever" Brand Bicycles Bad?

	A letter from the Shanghai Bicycle Factory stated that after seeing the People's Daily report on July 29 criticizing the poor quality of "Forever" brand bicycles, we contacted the critics and conducted a detailed understanding.

	The quality of some "Forever" brand bicycles is indeed not good. The reasons are: some are due to improper assembly or failure to adjust parts in time when they are found to be loose during use, such as the chain and pedals falling off. In the future, in addition to hoping that assembly units in various regions will improve the quality of assembly, we are also compiling and printing instructions for the installation, use, and maintenance of bicycles. Some are due to defects in the products manufactured by cooperative factories, such as tires being produced by the Shanghai Joint State-Private Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory and Zhengtai Rubber Factory. We have contacted them and asked them to take measures to improve quality. We have also established a regular acceptance inspection system to ensure the quality of cooperative parts.

    对批评的反应
    长乐牙膏质量将提高
    地方国营吉林日用化学工厂来信：9月12日人民日报所载“长乐牙膏爱变质”一稿的批评是对的。长乐牙膏的质量降低，主要是我厂自1955年6月份起，为了满足用户对牙膏泡沫多、香味特殊的要求，轻率地改变了技术配方，造成了牙膏裂管、漏水和变质现象。
    1955年年底，我厂发现了这个问题，就组织了技术人员进行研究分析，在今年又组织了一批人员到上海、广州各兄弟厂去学习，现在新的技术配方已经研究成功了，等待省工业厅审核批准后，就可以生产。
    冶金工业部支持报纸批评
    本报7月18日发表“为什么借了不还”一文，批评冶金工业部建筑局第六冶金化学建筑总公司不执行劳动力调借合同，7月19日发表“鬼鬼祟祟的招工者”一文，批评冶金工业部建筑局管道安装总公司第一公司和第二公司私自招工；7月20日发表“一个受到百般刁难的先进单位”一文，批评鞍山钢铁建设公司包头分公司第一建筑工程公司不支持先进单位。冶金工业部很重视这些批评，已于7月20、21日分别发电报给所属被批评的单位，责令他们迅速认真检查，并限期将检查结果答复本报。
    永久牌自行车为何不好
    上海自行车厂来信说，看到人民日报7月29日批评永久牌自行车质量不好的报道以后，我们就和批评者联系，进行了详细的了解。
    永久牌自行车有的质量的确不好。其原因：有的是因为装配不妥或使用时发现零件松动没有及时调整，如车链、脚踏脱掉等。今后，除了希望各地装配单位提高装配质量外，我们正在编印自行车的安装及使用保养说明书。有的是由于协作厂制造的产品有缺陷，如车胎都是上海公私合营大中华橡胶厂和正泰橡胶厂生产的，我们已跟他们联系，请他们采取措施改进质量。我们也建立了经常的验收检查制度，以保证协作零件的质量。
