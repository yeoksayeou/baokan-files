Found a Way to Improve Product Quality
By our reporter Liu Fan

How to improve the quality of silk fabrics is still a problem plaguing many silk factories. The Dachang Silk Factory in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, has been free from this trouble for a year. A year ago, the factory's leaders were almost losing confidence due to the endless stream of defective products; now, the factory can complete its quality plan every quarter.

After the Dachang Silk Factory became a joint state-private enterprise in 1954, it produced fourteen varieties of silk fabrics, including real silk fabrics, rayon fabrics, real silk and rayon blends, real silk and spun silk blends, georgette, antique satin, and rayon soft satin. From January to August 1955, it failed to meet its quality plan for eight consecutive months. Taking rayon soft satin as an example, the defect rate in May was as high as 93.8%. In June, all one hundred and sixty-two rolls of rayon soft satin produced were defective. At that time, the factory was in dire straits. The silk company came to pick up goods but could not find silk fabrics that met the quality standards, so they condemned the factory. The higher authorities also criticized the factory for failing to meet quality targets for a long time. In a silk factory, nothing is more painful than producing defective products. The workers were sweating anxiously in front of the machines, and the factory director was as anxious as an ant on a hot pot.

In this situation, how to improve quality and eliminate defective products became an urgent task for the Dachang Silk Factory.

The leaders of the Dachang Silk Factory thought: The defect rate of rayon soft satin is the highest, and improving the quality of rayon soft satin should be the focus of the work. However, if we look for the key within the factory, there are more than four hundred screws on each of the eighty machines, how can we find it all at once? Since other factories can produce rayon soft satin, wouldn't taking their methods be a shortcut to improving quality? So in June and July of last year, Deputy Director Zhang and the head of the production technology department went to silk factories in Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai to find solutions. They first went to Suzhou Xinlun and Ziban Silk Factories, and then to Hangzhou Silk Factory. At that time, these factories were also troubled by defective products, and the defect rate of rayon soft satin in these factories was as high as 60% to 80%. Finally, Deputy Director Zhang went to silk factories such as Shanghai Meiwen, Hulian, and Jiuchang. Because Meiwen Silk Factory adopted machine sizing, the defect rate of rayon soft satin was only about 30%. Deputy Director Zhang brought back a method of machine sizing. After adopting machine sizing, in mid-July, the defect rate of rayon soft satin in Dachang Silk Factory did drop to 30%. However, not long after, the flood of defective products relapsed like a malignant disease. At the end of July and the beginning of August, the defect rate of rayon soft satin was again as high as 90% or more. Because the factory leadership focused its energy on rayon soft satin and relaxed the leadership of other fabric production, the quality of other silk fabrics also declined.

In this situation, the CPC Huzhou Municipal Committee, in response to the problems in the factory, helped them hold three professional meetings one after another, from top to bottom, to conduct a heated discussion on how to improve the quality of silk fabrics. Finally, everyone agreed that not only should they absorb the advanced experience of other factories, but they must also rely on the masses and thoroughly and meticulously search for the key to improving quality based on the specific conditions of their factory.

In the past, the factory leaders also superficially went deep into the workshops. For example, Deputy Director Zhang, who was promoted from a worker, often ran to the workshop; the factory director's office was next to the workshop, and he could see the production situation in the workshop by opening the window. However, at that time, when they went to the workshop, they did not pay attention to finding and solving key problems in production quality. In July of last year, the factory party organization held several meetings. After discussion, everyone clearly realized that so-called "going deep into the workshop" did not mean simply running to the workshop every day to take a look, but that it was important to rely on the workers and give play to their wisdom to find key problems in production and quality after the leaders went deep into the workshop, and to propose effective solutions. In August of last year, the factory director, the party branch secretary, and the staff of the department went down to the workshop together. First, they familiarized themselves with the properties of rayon together with the workers. For example, rayon has no elasticity, and more than thirty fine fibers make up one thread. If it is stretched by three centimeters during the production process, it is three centimeters, while real silk can shrink back after being stretched; rayon is suitable for dryness and not for humidity, while real silk needs more humidity... On this basis, they also inspected and analyzed the causes of defective products according to the process together with the workers, found out the key to forty-six kinds of new and old defects commonly found in the silk fabric production process, such as bright silk, skipped silk, and oil stains, and took timely measures to solve them. For example, during the inspection, it was found that rayon soft satin often produced the defects of bright silk and skipped silk, mainly because the speed of the winding machine was uneven, the speed of the warping machine was too fast, some reeds in the separating reed part were uneven, the yarn tube stock on the beaming machine was rusty, and the friction between the bottom of the yarn tube and the frame was uneven. After checking out these problems, they immediately solved them one by one. Because the leaders carried out in-depth inspections and specifically solved the key problems of defective products, from September of last year to August of this year, the mixed first-class product rate of the factory's silk fabrics has been stable at around 98%, and the factory has shown an unprecedented new atmosphere.

In the past year, in order to consolidate and gradually improve the quality of silk fabrics, the leadership of the Dachang Silk Factory led the workers to improve operating methods, formulate and implement systematic operating procedures and storage methods for rayon raw materials. They also established five systems to ensure product quality: 1. Regularly hold professional meetings on the quality of each variety; 2. Regularly explain operating techniques to workers by the technical department and advanced producers according to the quality inspection situation; 3. Regularly analyze the causes of defective products and the responsibility for defective products; 4. Regularly conduct inspection of gray fabrics and comparison of finished fabrics; 5. Regularly conduct mechanical maintenance and cleaning inspections. These have all played a great role in improving product quality.

After the factory leaders went deep into the workshop, they not only solved the technical problems of improving product quality, but also further realized that the workers' work mood is very closely related to increasing production and improving quality. For example, problems such as quarrels between husband and wife and financial difficulties will make the workers unable to concentrate during production and produce defective products. In order to enable the workers to concentrate on production, the factory party branch and the administrative leadership actively carried out the work of understanding people and caring for people. The party branch secretary often held forums for old workers, young workers, female workers, and workers' family members to understand their thoughts and living conditions, and to help them solve difficult problems. In the first half of this year, the factory issued more than 700 yuan in administrative subsidies alone. At the beginning of August, when a typhoon passed through, the houses of seven workers in the factory were damaged, and the factory provided more than 150 yuan for relief. At the same time, the factory also implemented a reward system. From April to July of this year, sixty-eight workers received quality rewards. The factory leaders' concern for the workers' lives has also greatly increased the workers' enthusiasm for production and ensured the quality of products.

The fact that the product quality of the Dachang Silk Factory has gone from bad to good shows that as long as we proceed from the specific situation of the enterprise and do some solid work in depth, the product quality can definitely be improved.

### 找到了提高产品质量的途径

    找到了提高产品质量的途径
    本报记者　刘凡
    怎样提高丝织品质量，至今还是不少绸厂苦恼的问题。浙江省湖州市达昌绸厂摆脱这个苦恼已经有一年了。一年以前，这个厂的领导人员曾经被次品折磨得几乎失去信心；现在，这个工厂每个季度都能完成质量计划。
    达昌绸厂在1954年公私合营以后，出产真丝织品、人造丝织品、真丝和人造丝交织品、真丝和绢丝交织品，乔其、古香缎、人造丝软缎等十四个品种。1955年1月至8月，连续八个月没有完成质量计划。以人造丝软缎为例，5月份次品率高达93.8％，6月份生产了一百六十二匹人造丝软缎，全部成了次品。当时，工厂是“四面楚歌”，丝绸公司来取货，取不到合乎质量标准的绸缎，便谴责厂方；上级对工厂长期完不成质量指标也提出了批评。在绸厂里，没有什么比出次品更令人痛心的了。工人们对着机器急得冒汗，厂长急得像热锅上的蚂蚁。
    在这种情况下，如何提高质量，消灭次品，就成了达昌绸厂刻不容缓的任务了。
    达昌绸厂的领导人员想：人造丝软缎的次品率最高，提高人造丝软缎的质量应该是工作重点。但是，假如在厂内找关键，八十多台机器，一台机器的螺丝钉就有四百多个，怎么能够一下子找到呢？既然外厂能生产人造丝软缎，把人家一套办法拿来，不是一条提高质量的捷径吗？于是在去年6、7月间，章副厂长和生产技术科长便到苏州、杭州、上海等绸厂去找办法。他们先到苏州新纶、自办绸厂，后来又到杭州绸厂。当时，这些厂也在为次品苦恼，这些厂人造丝软缎的次品率也高达60％到80％。最后，章副厂长到了上海美文、沪联、九昌等绸厂。美文绸厂由于采用机器上浆，人造丝软缎的次品率只在30％左右，章副厂长就弄了一条机器上浆的办法回来。采用机器上浆以后，7月中旬，达昌绸厂人造丝软缎的次品率果然降低到了30％。可是，过了不久，次品泛滥的情况又像恶性疾病似的复发了。7月底8月初，人造丝软缎的次品率又高达90％以上。由于工厂领导方面把精力集中在人造丝软缎上，放松了对其他织物生产的领导，其他十多种丝织品的质量也下降了。
    就在这种情况下，中共湖州市委针对厂里的问题，帮助他们先后召开了三次专业会议，自上而下地对如何提高丝织品质量的问题进行了热烈的讨论。最后，大家一致认为：不仅要吸取外厂的先进经验，同时必须根据本厂的具体情况，依靠群众，深入地、细致地寻找提高质量的关键。
    过去，这个厂的领导人员表面上也深入了车间。如章副厂长是由工人提拔起来的，常常跑到车间里去；厂长办公室就在车间的旁边，推开窗户就看得到车间的生产情况。但是，那时候他们到车间去，并没有注意寻找和解决生产质量方面的关键性问题。去年7月间，工厂党组织曾经召开了几次会议，经过讨论，大家明确认识到所谓“深入车间”，并不是仅仅天天跑到车间里去看看，重要的是在领导人员深入车间以后，要善于依靠工人，发挥工人的智慧，去寻找生产中和质量方面的关键性问题，提出有效的解决办法。去年8月间，厂长、党支部书记、科室工作人员一起下到了车间。首先和工人一道摸熟了人造丝的性能。例如，人造丝没有伸缩性，三十多根细纤维组成一根丝，在生产过程中拉长三公分就是三公分，而真丝拉长以后还可以缩回来；人造丝宜燥不宜湿，而真丝需要更多的湿度……。在这个基础上，他们又和工人一起按工序检查、分析出次品的原因，把丝织品生产过程中经常出现的亮丝、跳丝、油渍等四十六种新旧病疵的关键都找出来了，并且及时采取了解决的措施。例如检查中发现，人造丝软缎常常产生亮丝和跳丝的毛病，主要是因为络丝车车速快慢不匀，扦经车车速过快，分绞钢筘部分筘片起痕不滑，整经车上插筒子洋元生锈以及筒子底和架子磨擦不匀。检查出这些毛病以后，马上逐一解决。由于领导人员深入检查，具体解决了出次品的关键问题，从去年9月到今年8月，这个厂丝织品的混合正品率都稳定在98％左右，厂里出现了前所未有的新气象。
    在过去的一年中，达昌绸厂领导方面为了巩固和逐步提高丝织品的质量，领导工人改进了操作方法，制定和实行了系统的操作规程和人造丝原料的保管方法。他们还建立了五项保证产品质量的制度：一、经常举行各品种质量的专业会议；二、定期由技术部门和先进生产者根据质量检验情况，向工人讲解操作技术；三、经常分析产生次品的原因和产生次品的责任；四、经常进行坯绸检验和熟绸对比；五、定期进行机械检修和清洁检查。这都对提高产品质量起了很大的作用。
    这个厂的领导人员深入车间以后，不但解决了提高产品质量的技术问题，还进一步认识到工人的工作情绪对增加产量、提高质量有着非常密切的关系。例如夫妇吵架、生活困难等问题，都会使工人在生产时思想不集中，产生次品。为了使工人能专心进行生产，工厂党支部和行政领导方面积极进行了解人、关心人的工作。党支部书记经常召开老工人、青年工人、女工和工人家属座谈会，了解他们的思想和生活情况，并且帮助他们解决困难问题。今年上半年，工厂仅发放行政补助费就有七百多元。8月初台风过境，这个厂有七户工人的住宅受到损坏，厂里拿出一百五十多元进行了救济。同时，厂里还实行了奖励制度，今年4月到7月就有六十八个工人得到质量奖励。工厂领导人员对工人生活的关心，也大大提高了工人的生产积极性，保证了产品的质量。
    达昌绸厂产品质量由坏到好的事实，说明了只要从企业的具体情况出发，深入地做些踏实的工作，产品质量是一定可以提高的。
