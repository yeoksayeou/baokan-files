    Folk Schools in Gansu Province Reopen One After Another
    Nearly Three Million Farmers Will Enroll
    110,000 Farmers in Southern Shanxi Escape Illiteracy

    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The busy farming season is coming to an end, and many folk schools in Gansu Province that were dismissed during the busy season have reopened one after another. Some places are training amateur cultural teachers. It is estimated that nearly 2.8 million farmers in the province will participate in cultural learning this winter.

    In the first half of this year, more than 1,704,000 farmers in Gansu Province regularly participated in spare-time cultural learning. The number of young and middle-aged illiterates in the province who persisted in learning accounted for more than 34% of the total number of young and middle-aged people. Among them, more than 69,000 people have reached the standard for graduating from literacy classes.

    This newspaper reports: In the Jinan (Southern Shanxi) District of Shanxi Province, since last winter, more than 114,000 farmers have been lifted out of illiteracy. This number is more than four times the number of people who were made literate in 1955. After examinations, they can all recognize from more than 900 to more than 1,500 characters. Among the 21 graduates of the Shibiwu Village Folk School in Anze County this spring, 16 have served as chairwomen of women's federations, work recorders, custodians, statisticians, and breeding stock leaders of agricultural cooperatives.
