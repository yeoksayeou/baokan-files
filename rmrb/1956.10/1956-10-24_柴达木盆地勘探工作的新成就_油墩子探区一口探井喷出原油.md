New Achievements in Exploration Work in the Qaidam Basin
    Oil Well in Youdunzi Exploration Area Gushes Crude Oil

    Xining, October 20th (From Our Newspaper) – The first deep exploration well in the Youdunzi exploration area of the Qaidam Basin flowed crude oil on October 6th.

    The Youdunzi oil exploration area was opened on May 17th this year. Since the first deep exploration well in this exploration area started drilling in early June, after four months of efforts by the drilling workers, it finally penetrated the oil layer. On the morning of October 6th, after the drilling workers finished running the casing, while waiting for the cement injected into the well to solidify, the pointer of the pressure gauge on the cement head of the wellhead suddenly rose by ten atmospheres. The bubbles at the wellhead made an increasingly loud roar, and then a mixture of oil and water gushed out, reaching a height of ten meters. At this time, clusters of natural gas, like dense clouds, completely enveloped the wellhead, and dark green crude oil continued to pour out, with a strong oily smell permeating the surrounding well site. By October 7th, this well was still continuously flowing oil.

    According to the test results, the quality of the crude oil here is good, with a relatively high gasoline content, and has great industrial value.

    There are large areas of oil seeps on the ground near this exploration area. The oil production from the deep well in this exploration area once again proves that the Qaidam Basin is a very promising oil area in our country.

    柴达木盆地勘探工作的新成就
    油墩子探区一口探井喷出原油
    本报西宁20日电　柴达木盆地油墩子探区的第一口深探井在10月6日流出原油。
    油墩子石油探区是今年5月17日开辟的。这个探区的第一口深探井自6月初开钻以来，经过钻井工人四个月的努力，终于钻进油层。10月6日早晨，钻井工人下完套管以后，在等候注入井内的水泥凝固的期间，井口水泥头上的压力表的指针转瞬间升高十个大气压，井口的气泡发出愈来愈大的吼声，接着，油水混合油体喷出，高达十公尺。这时，一团团的天然气如浓云密布，把井口全部笼罩，深绿色的原油不断涌出，井场周围弥漫着强烈的油味。到10月7日，这口井仍在不断流油。
    根据化验结果，这里原油质量良好，含汽油成分相当高，有很大的工业价值。
    这个探区附近地面有大片的油苗露头。这个探区的深井出油，又一次证明柴达木盆地是我国一个希望很大的石油区。
