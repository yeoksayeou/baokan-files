    Random Thoughts on National Day
    Ma Qianzu
    Another annual National Day is here. Counting, it has been a full seven years.

    On the eve of this year's National Day, the Communist Party of China convened its Eighth National Congress, summarizing the experiences and achievements of the past eleven years, and showcasing the prospects of the socialist motherland and the goals of the people's struggle. This truly makes it impossible to express such excitement and joy in words.

      Seven years is not short, but not too long either. However, in these seven years, the thousands-year-old system of exploitation has been basically eliminated on the land of China. "The main contradiction within our country is already the contradiction between the people's demand for the establishment of an advanced industrial country and the reality of a backward agricultural country, and the contradiction between the people's need for rapid economic and cultural development and the current state of the economy and culture that cannot meet the people's needs." This is truly an earth-shattering change. But as an intellectual, how much strength have I contributed to this change? In the quiet of the night, questioning my heart, I truly feel ashamed.

    In the past seven years, I haven't had any free time either. My lifestyle has always been so monotonous: going to the office from home on time, and going home from the office on time, alternating day and night. Old friends, working in the same city, can go without seeing each other for half a year or a year. I don't know when the Capital Theater was built, and I still haven't been inside to see a play. This seems to imply that I am a very active worker. However, calculating my own achievements, what have I contributed to this great country, to the great people?

    In the Kuomintang era, we advocated revolutionary literature, which was an era of "enduring to see comrades become new ghosts, angrily seeking small poems in the thick of knives." But the Kuomintang's strategists still put on the faces of "gentlemen," shouting: "Show us the goods!" It is naturally true that writers must have works, but holding a knife in one hand, severing the connection between writers and the people; while shouting, wanting writers to produce works, their intentions are truly vicious. However, we still had our Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, Mao Dun. Small soldiers like me also did some "brick-digging" and "wall-demolishing" work. For the sake of life, I always had to sell one or two manuscripts a year, and publish one or two collections. Now, it is truly the time to "show the goods." But for seven years, nothing. Saying it is because I am busy with editorial work, then, past literary editors have indeed sent out many solid writers: Lao She, Ba Jin, Wu Zuxiang, etc. But now, at least in my own work, I have not recommended a single good work to readers. This shows that my so-called "busy" is just another name for "floating." Floating on the surface of work and life, slipping past like a dream, how can this resolve the contradiction of "culture not meeting the needs of the people"? Thinking about it, I feel like I have committed a crime.

    I have a nephew who lost his father when he was five or six years old, and after studying for two or three years, he was sent to herd cattle. After that, he worked on his own small amount of land, supporting a family of several people. After liberation, he became the head of his hometown. In 1953, I returned to my hometown for the first time in twenty years. This young man, who only knew a smattering of classical Chinese, was leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement, not only very familiar with the psychology of the peasants, but also talking about the ingredients of fertilizer, such as phosphorus and potassium. Afterwards, we occasionally corresponded, and I learned that he had gone through training courses in the special zone, joined the Party, and was transferred to work in the county's agricultural department. Recently, he wrote to me asking me to pick out some books summarizing work experience and philosophical books for him. The letter was also written clearly and coherently. He also told me that the county had suffered two typhoons and two floods, disasters unprecedented in history. Although this year's production plan cannot be completed, they are currently engaged in the struggle against natural disasters, and the entire county will basically achieve "advanced collectivization" before the autumn harvest. His tone was very confident. I also heard from people who came out of my hometown: in our barren mountainous area sixty miles from the city, where people could only be allocated 1.2 mu of land, now not only has the entire township established advanced cooperatives, but even the surrounding high mountains have been reclaimed and planted with highland crops and fruit trees. In the near future, a motor road will also be opened, and in the rugged terrain of Hengshan, hydropower stations will be built using the steepness of the water flow. "The Communist Party knows how to find solutions, and for the sake of the common people, they can come up with any solution," that fellow villager said. I think, for such a reality, such a prospect, young people like my nephew have all contributed their share. With contribution, they have also grown. Personal achievement is built on the basis of contribution to the people, which is how our society is different from the society of exploiters.

    Therefore, I am envious of the great creativity of our country's working people, and ashamed of my own lack of accomplishment. However, I have not lost my confidence, I will catch up! To build a brick, then another brick, for the socialist construction of our motherland, to welcome one National Day, and then another National Day...

    国庆杂感
    马前卒
    一年一度的国庆又到眼前。一算，已经整整的七年了。
    在今年国庆节前夕，中国共产党召开了第八次全国代表大会，总结了十一年来的经验和成就，展示了社会主义祖国的前景和人民奋斗的目标，这真叫人无法用笔来写出这种兴奋和欢快。
      七年的时间不算短，但也不算太长。可是，就在这七年中，几千年的剥削制度，却已在中国的大地上基本消灭了。“我们国内的主要矛盾，已经是人民对于建立先进的工业国的要求同落后的农业国的现实之间的矛盾，已经是人民对于经济文化迅速发展的需要同当前经济文化不能满足人民需要的状况之间的矛盾。”这真是如何惊天动地的变革。但作为知识分子的我，有多少力量贡献于这个变革？清夜问心，实在觉得无地自容。
    七年来，我也不曾有过空闲。生活方式总是那样呆板：按时从居处到办公室，又按时从办公室到居处，这样来复换白天和黑夜。旧时的好友，同在一个城里工作，可以半年一年不见。首都剧场不知是什么时候建立的，我至今还没有进去里面看过一次戏。这算来，好像我是个非常积极的工作人员了。然而算一算自己的成绩，有过什么东西贡献给这个伟大的国家，伟大的人民？
    在国民党时代，我们提倡革命文学，那是“忍看朋辈成新鬼，怒向刀丛觅小诗”的时代。而国民党的策士们，却还装出“正人君子”的面孔，叫道：“拿出货色来”。是作家总得有作品，那道理自然是不错的，但一手拿刀，割断了作家与人民的联系；一面叫喊，要作家拿出作品来，其用心实在是毒辣的。然而，我们还有我们的鲁迅，郭沫若，茅盾。像我这样的小卒，也多少做了些“挖砖头”“拆墙脚”的工作。为了生活，一年也总得卖出一、二部稿子，出一、二部集子。现在呢，真的是要“拿出货色来”的时候了。可是七年了，没有。说是为的忙于编辑工作吧，那么，过去的文学编辑工作者，确实送出了不少的坚实的作家：老舍、巴金，吴组缃等等。可是，现在呢，至少在我自己的工作中，却没有向读者推荐出一部好作品。这就可见我的所谓“忙”，不过是“浮”的别名。浮在工作与生活的表面，梦一样的滑过去了，这又怎么能去解决“文化不能满足人民需要”的矛盾呢？想起来，真有像犯罪一样的感觉。
    我有一个侄子，五、六岁就死了父亲，念了二三年书后就给人去放牛。之后，又在自己少数的地上干活，养活一家几口。解放了，他当上了本乡的乡长。1953年，我回到二十年没回去过的故乡。这个仅识之乎的青年，正在领导互助合作运动，不仅很熟稔农民的心理，却还大谈其肥田粉的成分，什么磷呀钾的。之后，我们偶然也有通信，知道他经过专区的训练班的训练，入了党，调县农业部门工作，最近，来信要我挑一些总结工作经验的书籍和哲学书籍给他。信也写得条理分明，十分通顺了。并且告诉我，本县二次台风，二次洪水，灾害是历史上前所未见的。今年生产计划虽然不能完成，却正在展开对自然灾害的斗争，并且全县要在秋收前基本实现“高级化”。口气是十分自信的。我也从故乡出来的人那里听到：我们这离城六十里的贫瘠的山区，人们只能分到一亩二分的土地的，现在不仅全乡成立了高级社，连四面的高山也都垦植起来，种上了高地作物和果树了。不久的将来，汽车路也要通了，在横山这个崎岖地带，将利用水势的峻急，建立发电站。“共产党就是会想办法，为了老百姓，什么办法会想得出来。”那个同乡人说。我想，这样的现实，这样的前景，像我侄子那样的青年人，是都贡献出一份力量的。有贡献，也就成长起来了。个人的成就是建立于对人民的贡献的基础之上的，这就是我们的社会不同于剥削者的社会。
    我以是有羡于我国劳动人民的伟大创造力，而有愧于自己之不成器。然而，我还不失自信，追上去！为我们祖国的社会主义建设，垒一块砖，再垒一块，迎接一次国庆，再迎接一次国庆……
