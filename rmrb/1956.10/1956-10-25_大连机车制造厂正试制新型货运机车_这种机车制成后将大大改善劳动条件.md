Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, 20th. After successfully trial-producing the "Peace Type" locomotive, the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory is now trial-producing a new type of "ㄇㄎ一" freight locomotive.

The "ㄇㄎ一" type freight locomotive is currently the most used locomotive in China's railways. Due to the backward performance and equipment of this type of locomotive, it cannot adapt to the rapid increase in China's freight volume. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways has requested the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory to change the design of this locomotive.

After redesigning, the steam pressure of the new "ㄇㄎ一" type locomotive will be increased from 14 kg to 15 kg; its traction force will be increased by 7%; the locomotive's running speed can be increased by 18% on flat roads and 8% on slopes. This new type of locomotive is supplied with coal by an automatic stoker. This not only completely frees the stoker workers from heavy physical labor, but also reduces coal consumption by 13%.

The driver's cab of the new "ㄇㄎ一" type locomotive, like the driver's cab of the "Peace Type" locomotive, has seats, heating equipment for food, and heating equipment. This will greatly improve the working conditions of the driver.

    大连机车制造厂正试制新型货运机车
    这种机车制成后将大大改善劳动条件
    新华社旅大20日电　大连机车车辆制造工厂在试制成功“和平型”机车以后，现在又在试制一种新型的“ㄇㄎ一”型货运机车。
    “ㄇㄎ一”型货运机车是我国铁路目前使用最多的一种机车。由于这种机车的性能和装置落后，不能适应我国的货运量迅速增加的情况。因此，铁道部要求大连机车车辆制造工厂改变这种机车的设计。
    经过重新设计后的新“ㄇㄎ一”型机车的汽压将从十四公斤提高到十五公斤；它的牵引力将比原来提高7％；机车的行驶速度在平道上能提高18％，在坡道上提高8％。这种新型机车是用自动加煤机供煤的。这不仅完全解脱了司炉工人的笨重体力劳动，而且用煤量也将能够减少13％。
    新型的“ㄇㄎ一”型机车的司机室和“和平型”机车的司机室一样，有坐椅、热饭设备和取暖设备等。这将大大改善司机的劳动条件。
