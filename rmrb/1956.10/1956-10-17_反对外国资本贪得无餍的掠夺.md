Foreign Companies Plunder Huge Profits
Pakistani Businessmen Greatly Dissatisfied

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 15th - According to the "Pakistan Times," Pakistani industrialists and manufacturers are very concerned about some foreign companies, especially British companies, remitting large amounts of profit back to their home countries.

Manufacturers and industrialists have criticized this practice, as it results in Pakistan losing its extremely scarce foreign exchange.

One influential industrialist said, "Those of us who are directly affected by the lack of foreign exchange are people like us." He said that approximately 300 million rupees in foreign exchange will be used to purchase grain this year. This means that if an equivalent amount of foreign exchange cannot be borrowed from some sources, the country's nascent industry will suffer, "but in the meantime, we are allowing foreign companies to remit large amounts of foreign exchange."

Industrialists and manufacturers expressed the hope that the government would conduct a thorough investigation of the operations of foreign companies.

Pakistani business people also criticized the government's unreasonable practices in managing prices. For example, a British soap company recently earned a profit of 100 percent. The price of this company's soap in Pakistan is much higher than the price in India, while the price of soap manufactured by a Pakistani company is only about half that of the British company.

    反对外国资本贪得无餍的掠夺
    外国公司掠走巨额利润
    巴基斯坦工商界人士大为不满
    新华社喀喇蚩15日电　据“巴基斯坦时报”报道，巴基斯坦工业家和制造商对于某些外国公司，特别是英国公司，把大笔利润汇回本国表示十分忧虑。
    制造商和工业家们纷纷抨击这种做法，因为这样做的结果使巴基斯坦丧失极其缺乏的外汇。
    一位有影响的工业家说，“由于缺乏外汇而直接受损失的是我们这些人”。他说，今年大约要用三亿卢比的外汇来购买粮食。这就意味着，如果不能从某些方面借到同等数量的外汇，这个国家的新兴工业就要受到损失，“但是在这个期间我们却允许外国公司把大笔外汇汇走”。
    工业家和制造商们表示希望政府对外国公司的业务进行一次彻底调查。
    巴基斯坦商业界人士也对政府在管理物价方面的不合理的做法提出批评。例如一家英国肥皂公司最近获得的利润达百分之百。这家公司的肥皂在巴基斯坦的售价比在印度的售价高得多，而一家巴基斯坦公司制造的肥皂，售价只及这家英国公司的一半左右。

    黎巴嫩工人坚持罢工表示抗议

    “电讯报”报道，黎巴嫩总统夏蒙在10月14日接见了一个黎巴嫩工会代表团，代表团要求他出面干预同伊拉克石油公司的纠纷。
    反对荷兰公司残酷剥削
    印度尼西亚一万多石油工人罢工
    新华社雅加达15日电　据印度尼西亚新闻社报道，一万五千名石油工人10月14日举行全面罢工，抗议荷兰资本的巴塔夫石油公司迫使工人过度操作。参加这次联合行动的工人占在全国各地替巴塔夫石油公司工作的工人总数的五分之三。这次罢工是在工人所提出的关于休假的要求没有得到解决以后举行的。
    一个工会发言人说，罢工将不牵涉到陆军、警察、医院、印度尼西亚鹰航空公司和其他政府机关。
