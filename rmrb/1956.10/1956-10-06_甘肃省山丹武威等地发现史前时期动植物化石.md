    Fossilized Prehistoric Flora and Fauna Discovered in Shandan, Wuwei and Other Areas of Gansu Province
    (Our report) The Gansu Provincial Museum has discovered a large number of prehistoric animal and plant fossils in Zhangjiachuan, Shandan, Wuwei, Xihe, Wudu and other places. After preliminary sorting, some of the fossil materials have been packed and transported to Lanzhou.
    Shandan, Wuwei, Xihe and other places contain a large number of fossils. In Shandan alone, more than a thousand types of extremely valuable fossils have been excavated and collected from the public. These animal and plant fossils include ivory, antlers, fish, tortoise shells, brachiopods, scale trees, reed trees, fungi, etc. Among them, many fossils, such as scale tree fossils and reed tree fossils, became extinct on Earth a long time ago. Preliminary identification shows that some fossils belong to the Devonian and Cenozoic eras. The fossils are from at least hundreds of thousands to as much as six or seven hundred thousand years old.
    The animal fossils discovered in Qingshui, Wuwei and other places are mostly ivory, one of which is 107 centimeters long, 10.8 centimeters in diameter, and weighs more than 24 catties. There is also a rare scale tree fossil, also known as silicified wood. This is a large tree from ancient times, three shi zhang long and more than three shi chi thick. Due to the collapse of the earth's crust, it was upside down, roots up, inserted into the rock. The outer skin of the scale tree fossil has regular quadrilateral and hexagonal scales, which are very similar to fish scales. Although these fossils are very precious, many areas have damaged the unearthed treasures due to lack of scientific knowledge. In order to protect ancient relics and enable them to serve science, it is hoped that all regions will pay attention to unearthed cultural relics. (Kuang Kuang)

    甘肃省山丹武威等地发现史前时期动植物化石
    本报讯　甘肃省博物馆在张家川、山丹、武威、西和、武都等地发现大量史前时期的动物和植物化石。经过初步整理，部分化石材料已装箱运往兰州。
    山丹、武威、西和各地蕴藏着大量的化石。仅在山丹一处就挖掘和在民间收集到一千多个种类极有价值的化石。这些动植物化石包括象牙、鹿角、鱼、龟壳、石燕、鳞树、芦树、菌类等。其中有不少化石，如鳞树化石、芦树化石，很早以前就在地球上绝种了。经初步鉴定，证明有一些化石属于泥盆纪和新生代。离现在少的有十几万年，多的有六七十万年。
    清水、武威各地发现的动物化石以象牙为最多，其中一只长达一百零七公分，它的直径有十点八公分，有二十四斤多重。还有一种罕见的鳞树化石，又叫矽化石。这是一种远古时代的大树，有三市丈长，三市尺多粗。由于地壳的崩陷，它头朝下根朝上倒插在岩石中。鳞树化石的外皮长着有规则的四边形和六边形的鳞层，和鱼的鳞甲非常相像。虽然这些化石是很宝贵的，但由于人们缺少科学知识，有很多地区把出土的宝物损坏了。为了保护古代的文物，使它能为科学服务，希望各地重视出土文物。　（匡匡）
