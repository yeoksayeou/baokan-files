Large Areas of High-Yielding Cotton Fields Appear in Shanxi and Henan
Shanxi Agricultural Science Departments are Summarizing High-Yield Experiences

Xinhua News Agency Report: In the area bordering Shan County and Lingbao County in Henan Province, a well-known cotton-producing region, nearly 40,000 mu of cotton fields are expected to yield over 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year. Such a large-scale bumper harvest is a first for Henan.

The 100-jin ginned cotton high-yield area stretches over twenty li from Wentang in Shan County in the east to Xiaonanchao in Lingbao County in the southwest. The nearly 40,000 mu of cotton generally grows well, with compact branches and twigs, and fruit branches are covered with large, plump bolls. The best, the Daying First Agricultural Cooperative in Shan County, estimates that its 8,474 mu of cotton will yield an average of 313 jin of seed cotton per mu, more than double last year's yield. The cotton of other cooperatives has also increased by about double last year's yield, and by 30% to 50% compared to 1952, the best cotton harvest year after liberation.

The soil here is sandy and has always been a major cotton-producing area. This year, these cooperatives correctly implemented the experience of large-scale high-yields from the Xinjiang cotton region based on local conditions, grasping the two decisive links for increasing production: timely early sowing and rational close planting, increasing the number of plants per mu from around 2,500 in previous years to around 5,000. At the same time, a series of yield-increasing measures were adopted, such as early and intermediate cultivation, early fertilization, careful and meticulous pruning, and pest control. As a result, tens of thousands of mu have achieved large-scale bumper harvests. Local veteran farmers said: 1921 was a good year for cotton here, and the best land yielded only a little over 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, but such a widespread good harvest as this year could only be achieved after collectivization.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch by Xinhua News Agency Reporter Wu Zanting: Many large areas of high-yielding cotton fields and high-yield cotton records have successively appeared in Shanxi Province.

According to survey materials received by the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture from the Jinan, Yuci, and Changzhi regions, more than 2.4 million mu of cotton fields have achieved large-scale bumper harvests, with an average yield of more than 150 jin of seed cotton per mu. Among them, more than 700,000 mu can produce an average of more than 300 jin of seed cotton per mu. In Jieyu County, a cotton-producing area in Jinan, more than 250,000 mu of cotton fields yielded more than 200 jin of seed cotton per mu. The agricultural cooperatives led by Qu Yaoli and Wu Chun'an, nationally known cotton-planting models, also continuously overcame disasters and achieved bumper harvests. The Pioneer Cooperative led by Wu Chun'an had 1,206 mu of cotton fields, with an average yield of 360 jin of seed cotton per mu, of which more than 80 mu yielded 810 jin of seed cotton per mu. The Hongfei Agricultural Cooperative in Hongzhao County had 42 mu of cotton fields, which yielded 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu, setting a new record for large-scale and high-yield cotton production in the province.

Shanxi Province originally planned to cultivate one million mu of large-scale high-yielding cotton fields. Later, due to the widespread promotion of advanced Xinjiang cotton planting experience by agricultural cooperatives in various places and vigorous efforts to overcome floods and pests, large areas of high-yielding cotton fields gradually expanded, enabling many cotton fields that were not originally large areas of high yield to achieve large-scale bumper harvests, and the quality of cotton was slightly improved compared to previous years. For example, the 32,000 mu of cotton fields in the Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Xizhanggeng Township, Jieyu County, focused on advancing the work of sowing, cultivating, setting seedlings, topdressing, and pest control by about ten days based on the advanced cotton planting experience of Xinjiang, and achieved more cultivation, more fertilization, and appropriately delayed topping time, resulting in an average yield of 205 jin of seed cotton per mu.

Currently, agricultural science departments at all levels in Shanxi Province are investigating and summarizing the experience of this year's large-scale bumper cotton harvest. The Shanxi Agricultural Science Research Institute has convened technicians from agricultural experiment stations in various places to comprehensively summarize the situation and problems of promoting Xinjiang cotton planting experience, and is preparing to improve the promotion of advanced experience in the coming year.

    山西河南出现许多大面积丰产棉田
    山西农业科学部门正总结丰产经验
    本报讯　在河南省著名的产棉区陕县、灵宝接壤地区，今年将有近四万亩棉田获得百斤皮棉的丰收。像这样大面积的丰收，在河南还是第一次。
    百斤皮棉丰产区东起陕县的温塘，西南到灵宝县的小南朝，长二十余里。这近四万亩的棉花普遍生长好，枝节紧凑，果枝上挂满了大而肥的桃子。丰产区中最好的陕县大营第一农业社的八千四百七十四亩棉花，估计平均每亩可收三百一十三斤籽棉，比去年增产一倍以上。其他的社的棉花也都比去年增产一倍左右，比解放后棉花收成最好的1952年也增产30％到50％。
    这里是沙质土壤，一向盛产棉花。今年这些社根据本地情况正确的推行了新疆棉区大面积丰产的经验，抓住了适时早播和合理密植这两个决定性的增产环节，每亩株数从往年的二千五百株上下增加到五千株左右。同时采用了早中耕、早施肥、精细整枝和防治虫害等一系列的增产措施，因此获得了几万亩的大面积丰收。当地老农们说：1921年这里棉花是好年成，好的一亩地也只收到一百多斤皮棉，但是像今年普遍的这样好，只有合作化以后才能办到。（河南日报编辑部）
    新华社讯　新华社记者武赞庭报道：山西省陆续出现了许多大面积丰产棉田和棉花高额丰产纪录。
    据山西省农业厅目前收到晋南、榆次、长治地区的调查材料，已有二百四十多万亩棉田获得大面积丰收，每亩一般可产籽棉一百五十斤以上。其中有七十多万亩平均每亩可产籽棉三百斤以上。晋南产棉区的解虞县二十五万多亩棉田，每亩产籽棉二百斤以上。全国著名植棉模范曲耀离和吴春安领导的农业社，也连续战胜灾害，获得了丰收。吴春安领导的先锋社一千二百零六亩棉田，每亩平均可产籽棉三百六十斤，其中有八十多亩每亩产籽棉八百一十斤。洪赵县洪飞农业社有四十二亩棉田，每亩可产籽棉一千斤，创造全省棉花大面积高额丰产的新纪录。
    山西省原来计划培植一百万亩大面积丰产棉田，后来由于各地农业社普遍推广新疆先进植棉经验，大力战胜了水灾和虫害，大面积丰产棉田逐渐扩大，使许多原来不是大面积丰产田的棉花也获得大面积丰收，而且棉花质量比往年略有提高。如解虞县西张耿乡星火农业社的三万二千多亩棉田，根据新疆先进的植棉经验，着重把播种、中耕、定苗、追肥和防治虫害等工作提前十天左右进行，并且做到多中耕、多施肥、合理推迟打顶时间，结果每亩平均产到籽棉二百零五斤。
    现在山西省各级农业科学部门正在调查和总结今年棉花大面积丰产的经验。山西农业科学研究所已召集各地农业试验站技术人员，全面总结推广新疆植棉经验的情况和问题，准备改进明年的先进经验推广工作。
