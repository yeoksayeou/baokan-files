Disputes on the Handan-Changzhi Highway
Guo Xiaoyu, Peng Liangfeng

From Handan in Hebei to Changzhi in Shanxi, there is a 202-kilometer highway, 138 kilometers of which are in Hebei and 64 kilometers in Shanxi. This highway plays an important role in connecting the material exchange between the two provinces and invigorating the economy of the mountainous areas.

The Handan-Changzhi Highway was built during the Anti-Japanese War by the "Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region People's Government" using the strength of the masses. The "Yutong Transportation Company" established by the Border Region Government operated the transportation business. After the national liberation, the transportation business on this highway was managed by the Handan Transportation Company of Hebei Province and the Changzhi Transportation Company of Shanxi Province. The Handan-Changzhi Highway became an inter-communication line for the two transportation companies of Handan and Changzhi.

However, the contradiction started from here.

Whether for Handan Transportation Company or Changzhi Transportation Company, the completion of transportation tasks on the Handan-Changzhi Highway has a decisive effect on the completion of production targets for the entire transportation company. Because within their scope of operation, only this highway has a long route, with materials available for both outbound and return trips, which can guarantee the vehicle load factor. Both transportation companies want to transport more goods on this route, which is not a bad thing in itself. However, they started to engage in departmentalism because of this. In 1951, Changzhi Transportation Company had a large backlog of materials due to insufficient transportation capacity, and cargo owners appealed for a solution to the transportation blockage in Changzhi. At this time, Handan Transportation Company received instructions from its superiors to send vehicles to Changzhi to provide support. Logically speaking, this action should have been welcomed by Changzhi Transportation Company, but the fact was not so. Changzhi Transportation Company mistakenly believed that Handan Transportation Company came to Changzhi to "seize cargo resources," which made them very angry. However, the cargo owners had goods, and they did not have the capacity to transport them, so how could they prevent others from transporting them? In the end, Changzhi Transportation Company believed that the misfortune was due to having too few vehicles. Therefore, they took decisive measures and sent a comrade with money to the Handan area to "lobby" for vehicles. As a result, they were turned back by the Handan Municipal Government.

As for the daily transportation work, both transportation companies only care about themselves and do not care about the other party's vehicles returning empty.

On the leadership level of both sides, they have also made some efforts on the surface to resolve the contradictions between the two companies. They sign agreements and contracts every year and hold a meeting once a month, but since the fundamental problem—departmentalism—has never been resolved, the contradictions have not only not been resolved but have continued to develop.

This situation has been reported to the transportation bureaus of the two provinces countless times, but the problem has never been resolved. In July 1955, the transportation bureaus of the two provinces were determined to solve this problem. The directors and business section chiefs of the two provincial transportation bureaus, as well as the managers and business section chiefs of the two transportation companies, stayed in Handan for eight or nine days, reviewed the previous work, offered opinions to each other, and the leaders of both sides also made criticisms, and re-signed the agreement. It was said that after this solemn meeting, the problem should have been solved, right? No, after the two provincial bureau directors left, departmentalism became even worse, and mutual difficulties became even more severe.

Last October, the number of empty return trips of Handan Transportation Company's vehicles from Changzhi to Handan reached more than 170, and each trip was calculated at 3.5 tons of cargo and 150 yuan of freight, resulting in a loss of more than 20,000 yuan due to empty running to the state. Handan Transportation Company believed that the empty running was too serious, so they sent people to Changzhi to understand the situation and found that it was not that there were no goods, but that Changzhi Transportation Company did not allow them to transport them. For example, there were more than 40 tons of scrap copper at that time, and the procedures had been completed for more than half a month, but they could not be transported out. The people sent by Handan Transportation Company argued with the person in charge of Changzhi Transportation Company for a long time before they barely managed to get more than a dozen truckloads of scrap copper.

Since then, the contradictions between the two transportation companies have deepened.

In the case of deepening contradictions, the transportation bureaus of the two provinces had to take the final measure, saying that in accordance with the spirit of "unified operation and independent accounting" of the Ministry of Communications, the transportation business of the Handan-Changzhi line was separated according to the proportion of Handan four and Changzhi six, and a "Handan-Changzhi Line Bus Station" was established, and station masters were sent to each other, and 30 cadres were transferred to supplement the two stations to exclusively manage the business of this highway line.

This method was officially implemented on April 1, 1956. It was said that this method should have solved the problem, right? Still not. For departmentalists, if the problem is not solved ideologically, no matter how complete the method or how strict the system, they will still find loopholes to exploit. In mid-April, Changzhi Transportation Branch (formerly Changzhi Transportation Company) played a trick. According to the original agreement, Changzhi Transportation Branch operated two scheduled buses each in the morning and at noon, but they arbitrarily added a morning bus without the consent of Handan Transportation Company. As a result, Handan Transportation Company's scheduled buses ran empty or could not guarantee full loads.

Handan Transportation Company would never ignore this practice of Changzhi Transportation Branch, so a thought-provoking incident occurred some time ago.

The matter is as follows: the Wuan Transportation Station on this highway is located half a mile away from the highway, and most of the goods loaded and unloaded at this station are concentrated at the Wuan Railway Station. According to this situation, the cadres stationed in Wuan by Changzhi Transportation Branch suggested moving the office location to the railway station, so as to avoid unnecessary losses caused by round trips. The local party committee supported this opinion, and the cadres of Changzhi Transportation Branch moved the office to a room of Handan Transportation Company at the Wuan Railway Station.

When the managers of Handan Transportation Company learned about this, they ignored how much benefit this move of Changzhi Transportation Branch would bring to saving expenses and accelerating vehicle turnover, and forcibly drove the cadres of Changzhi Transportation Branch back to the original place. Didn't they understand that it was a waste for each car to take an extra section of road each time? No, they understood, and it was precisely because they understood that they insisted on Changzhi Transportation Branch moving back to the original place.

Let’s look at the losses caused by the deliberate obstruction of Handan Transportation Company: calculated based on an average of 30 vehicles dispatched from Wuan Station per day (sometimes even more), a total of 30 kilometers more round trips, each vehicle carrying 3.2 tons, wasted 96 ton-kilometers. Calculated at the minimum freight rate of 0.245 yuan per ton-kilometer, more than 22 yuan is wasted every day, amounting to about 7,300 yuan a year. More importantly, the loss of time. Each detour takes an average of half an hour. If calculated at 30 vehicles, 15 hours are wasted every day, which is equivalent to one and a half cars being out of service every day.

At present, a large number of materials are backlogged in Handan and Changzhi, especially after entering August, when all efforts are put into flood prevention and rush transport work, the phenomenon of empty running has disappeared. However, this does not mean that the disputes between the two sides have been resolved. It's just that the focus of the disputes is different from before. Now, everyone is fighting for long-distance, easy-to-load and unload materials. When encountering such good goods, both sides send vehicles all day long; when encountering short-distance, difficult-to-transport materials, they do not send a single vehicle or send as few vehicles as possible, so that the phenomenon of transportation blockage cannot be resolved for a long time.

When will the disputes of departmentalism stop happening on this highway? Handan Transportation Company and Changzhi Transportation Branch, how are you two units going to solve this problem?

    邯长公路上的纠纷
    郭晓玉　彭良风
    河北邯郸至山西长治，有一条长达二百零二公里的公路，它在河北境内有一百三十八公里，在山西境内有六十四公里。这条公路对沟通两省物资交流和活跃山区经济有着重要作用。
    邯长公路是抗日战争时期“晋冀鲁豫边区人民政府”利用群众力量建设起来的，由边区政府设立的“裕通运输公司”经营运输业务，全国解放后，这条公路上的运输业务，交由河北省邯郸运输公司和山西省长治运输公司管辖，邯长公路也就成为邯郸和长治两家运输公司的互通线路了。
    然而，矛盾也就从这里开始了。
    无论是对邯郸运输公司说来，也无论是对长治运输公司说来，邯长公路上运输任务完成得好坏，在整个运输公司完成生产指标上都有决定性的作用。因为在他们经营的范围内，只有这条公路路线长，往返都有物资，能保证车辆实载率。两个运输公司都想在这条线路上多运些东西，这本来也不是什么坏事情，然而，他们却因此闹起本位主义来了。1951年，长治运输公司因为运力不足，积压下大批物资，货主纷纷呼吁要解决长治运输堵塞问题。这时，邯郸运输公司接到上级指示，派车到长治支援。照理说，这种行动应该受到长治运输公司的欢迎，可是，事实不然，长治运输公司错误地认为这是邯郸运输公司到长治地区来“抢夺货源”，十分气恼。然而，货主有货，自己又没有能力运，怎么能不让别人运呢？恼来恼去，长治运输公司认为倒霉倒在自己的车辆太少，于是，就采取断然措施，派了一位同志带钱到邯郸地区来“游说”车辆。结果被邯郸市政府挡了回去。
    至于在日常运输工作上，这两家运输公司都是只顾自己，不顾对方的车辆空驶而返。
    双方领导上，从表面看来，也尽过一些努力来解决两个公司之间的矛盾。逐年都要签订协议、合同，每个月还开一次碰头会，但是由于始终没有解决根本问题——本位主义思想，矛盾不但没有解决，而且继续发展下来。
    这种情况反映到两省交通厅运输局已不知多少次了，但始终没有解决问题。1955年7月，两省运输局下决心要解决这个问题，两省的运输局长，业务科长和两个运输公司的经理、业务科长等人，在邯郸住了八、九天，对以前的工作作了检查，互相提了意见，双方领导上也作了批判，并重新签订了协议。按说，经过这次郑重其事的会议，该解决问题了吧？不然，两省局长走后，本位主义反倒变本加厉，互相的刁难更加厉害了。
    去年10月，邯郸运输公司的汽车由长治放空返回邯郸的，竟达一百七十余车次之多，每车次按载重三点五吨，运费按一百五十元计算，就给国家造成二万多元的空驶损失。邯郸运输公司认为空驶太严重，就派人到长治去了解，发现并不是没有货，而是长治运输公司不让运。例如当时就有四十多吨碎铜，手续办了半个多月，还运不出去。邯郸运输公司派去的人同长治运输公司的负责人争吵了半天，才勉强争来十几车碎铜。
    自此，两个运输公司之间的矛盾更加深了。
    在矛盾加深的情况下，两省运输局不得不采取最后措施，说是按照交通部“统一经营、各自核算”的精神，将邯长线的运输业务按邯四长六分开，并成立“邯长线汽车站”，互派站长，抽调三十名干部充实两站，专掌这条公路线业务。
    这个办法由1956年4月1日正式实行。按说，这个办法该解决问题了吧？还是不然。对于本位主义者，如果不从思想上解决问题，再完整的办法，再严格的制度，也一样被他们钻出空子来。4月中旬，长治运输分局（原长治运输公司）就玩了个花样，按原协议规定，长治运输分局每天早晨、中午各开两部班车，但是他们不经邯郸运输公司同意就擅自增加了一部早晨班车。这样作的结果，造成了邯郸运输公司班车的空驶或保证不了实载。
    对于长治运输分局的这种作法，邯郸运输公司绝不会置若罔闻，于是，在前些时发生了一件耐人寻味的事。
    事情是这样的：这条公路上的武安运输站设在离公路半华里远的地方，而这个站装卸的货物绝大部分都集中在武安火车站。根据这种情况，长治运输分局驻武安的干部，建议将办公地点搬到火车站，这样可以避免不必要的往返所造成的损失。当地党委支持这个意见，长治运输分局的干部就把办公室搬到了武安火车站邯郸运输公司的一间房子里。
    邯郸运输公司的经理们知道了这件事，他们不顾长治运输分局搬这一次家，对节省开支，加速车辆周转有多少好处，硬把长治运输分局的干部撵到原来的地方去。难道他们不明白每辆汽车每次都要多拐一段路是一种浪费吗？不，他们是明白的，而且正是因为明白，才硬要长治运输分局搬回到原来的地方去。
    请看邯郸运输公司这种故意刁难造成的损失吧：按武安站平均每天发三十部车计算（有时还要多一点），共往返多走三十公里，每车载重三点二吨，就浪费了九十六个吨公里，按每个吨公里最低运价零点二四五元计算，每天就浪费二十二元多，一年即达七千三百元左右。更重要的是时间上的损失，每拐一次，平均需用半小时，若按三十部车计算，每天就浪费十五个小时，等于每天有一部半汽车停驶。
    目前，邯郸、长治两地都积压着大批物资，特别是进入8月份后，全力投入防汛抢运工作，空驶的现象已经没有了。但这并不是说双方的纠纷已随之而解，只不过是纠纷的重点与前不同罢了。现在，大家争的是长途的、容易装卸的物资，遇到这类好货，双方都整天派车；遇到短途的、不容易运的物资就一辆车也不派或尽可能少派车，以致运输堵塞现象长期不能解决。
    什么时候在这条公路上才能不再发生本位主义的纠纷呢？邯郸运输公司和长治运输分局，你们两个单位准备怎样来解决这个问题？
