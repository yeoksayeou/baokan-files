The Beginning of Industrial Construction in Shaanxi Province
Lu Zhi, Director of the Industry Department of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

Shaanxi Province is a relatively economically backward province in our country. Before liberation, there was no modern industry, only a few small and medium-sized textile and flour mills. The only modern means of transportation was the section of the Longhai Railway from Tongguan to Baoji. Although the Kuomintang reactionary rulers shouted about "developing the Great Northwest," they never took any practical action. On the contrary, in order to besiege and destroy the then Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, they disregarded the crisis of the nation and the country, and mobilized about 400,000 reactionary troops to concentrate here for harassment. What they built were not factories, but bunkers and defense lines; what they dug were not mines, but trenches and pitfalls. This place, which was already economically backward, was devastated by them and became a desolate scene.

In just three years after liberation, the economy of Shaanxi Province quickly recovered to the highest level during the Kuomintang rule. Since 1953, we have implemented the country's first Five-Year Plan. The working class in the Shaanxi area overcame numerous difficulties and began planned industrial construction on the trenches and bunker groups left by the Kuomintang reactionaries.

Shaanxi Province is located in the interior of the motherland and has favorable conditions for developing industry. From the perspective of the rational distribution of industrial zones, the state has determined Shaanxi as one of the key areas for industrial construction in the first Five-Year Plan, giving us extremely arduous industrial construction tasks. The land area occupied by capital construction in the Xi'an, Xianyang, Xingping, Baoji, and Hu County areas reaches more than 400,000 mu (part of which is civil construction serving industry). Currently, more than 6 million square meters of construction projects have been completed. The construction force required for construction projects is nearly 100,000 people, and the annual steel required for buildings is about 100,000 tons, cement about 400,000 tons, and nearly 1 billion bricks and tiles. From this figure, it is not difficult to see how huge its scale is. The construction speed in the Shaanxi area is also very fast. According to preliminary calculations, the investment amount for projects above the quota in the first Five-Year Plan is expected to exceed the plan by 8% by the end of 1957; the investment amount completed in the first half of this year was 281% of the same period last year. Judging from the construction speed of major projects, the average can be completed more than eleven months ahead of schedule; factories of the same nature are being built faster and faster. For example, the construction of the first 50,000-spindle textile factory took eleven months, the construction of the second textile factory of the same scale took only eight months, and the construction of the third 100,000-spindle textile factory only took nine months. The quality of the project is also getting higher and higher.

Now, the face of Shaanxi Province has changed. If you visit Xi'an, Xianyang, Xingping, and Baoji, what you see is no longer bunkers and moats, but rows of neat and brand-new factory buildings and staff dormitories. Everywhere you hear the sound of construction machinery turning and the whistles of trains and cars transporting materials.

With the start of large-scale industrial construction, the transportation industry is also developing rapidly. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the major artery running through the northwest and southwest of the motherland, has been fully connected.

Such large-scale industrial and railway construction, if it does not have locally produced coal as fuel and relies on long-distance transportation, how much loss will it bring to industrial production? Shaanxi's coal reserves are very rich. According to the currently proven Weibei Coalfield alone, the reserves reach more than 5 billion tons. It is estimated that the coal reserves in the entire Shaanxi Province will reach about 50 billion tons. According to the data from the Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau, in the Tongchuan mining area of the Weibei Coalfield, as of the end of July this year, geological detailed survey data for eleven wellheads had been submitted, with reserves of more than 400 million tons. By the end of this year, detailed survey reserve data of 1 billion tons can also be submitted in this area, which can meet the needs of well construction in this area during the second Five-Year Plan. Currently, the newly built and renovated mines in the Tongchuan area have completed two renovation projects. The newly built Wangjiahe No. 1 and No. 2 wells and the Sanlidong vertical shaft in Tongchuan will soon be put into production. The well construction task of the first Five-Year Plan is expected to be completed ahead of schedule and exceed the national plan. The well construction project of the second Five-Year Plan is also actively being prepared.

There are many difficulties in building such a scale of industry and railways. However, the workers in the Shaanxi area did not bow their heads in the face of difficulties. With the spirit of "making mountains bow their heads and rivers give way," they relied on collective strength and collective wisdom to overcome all the difficulties encountered in construction. Since the Party Central Committee issued the call to launch the advanced producer movement in March this year, socialist competitions and advanced producer movements have been widely launched throughout the province. In the past six months, this movement has formed a large-scale mass movement. According to statistics from eleven industries, 258 units participated in inter-factory competitions, more than 75,000 people proposed guarantees to complete production conditions, units and individuals who broke old quotas and created new records accounted for more than 30% of the employees, more than 20,000 rationalization proposals were put forward, and more than 1,000 advanced experiences were promoted. 563 advanced production units were emerged, and more than 30,000 advanced producers were selected. These advanced units and advanced figures have played a leading role in construction. For example, carpenter Fu Akun created an automatic rammer after several months of research, and one person could manage two machines, and one rammer was equivalent to the workload of sixty-four people a day. Door and window worker Zhang Mincai created a four-blade planer, which increased work efficiency by more than three times. Such examples are too numerous to mention.

The Shaanxi area does not have ready-made construction talents. Therefore, this has brought great difficulties to industrial construction. What should we do? The leading departments of Shaanxi Province have adopted the method of universally organizing on-the-job cadres to study during the construction process to solve the difficulties of insufficient cadres. Those who are illiterate learn culture, and those who do not have technology learn technology. In the past few years, industrial construction talents have grown from nothing, from few to many, and from completely ignorant to knowledgeable. However, the current number and quality of cadres still cannot meet the needs of development. The shortage of cadres is not in the tens, hundreds, or thousands, but in the tens of thousands. The solution is still only "self-reliance." In addition to the state training in schools, a large number of workers and cadres have been organized to conduct on-the-job learning this year. According to incomplete statistics in May, 665 cultural and technical spare-time schools have been opened, and 150,000 employees have participated in learning. Some units even have more than 97% of their employees participating in learning. By working and learning at the same time in this way, a large number of cadres can grow up. For example, the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory used this method to train and promote more than 600 cadres in the past two or three years. Especially after the Party Central Committee put forward the call to catch up with the world's scientific and technological level within twelve years, the enthusiasm of the vast number of employees to march towards culture and science has risen more widely. The on-the-job learning plans of some units' engineering and technical personnel are to reach the academic level of associate doctors within twelve years.

The above are just the beginning of industrial construction in the Shaanxi area. Larger-scale construction is still behind. The second and third Five-Year Plans will place greater tasks before the workers in the Shaanxi area. Judging from Shaanxi's geographical conditions and underground resources, the prospects for industrial construction and development are broad. Shaanxi Province will be an advanced base for developing the rich treasures of the Great Northwest of the motherland. In terms of transportation, Xi'an will be one of the largest railway hubs in the country. With the Longhai Line as the backbone, in addition to the Xi'an-Lanzhou and Baoji-Chengdu railways, it will also lead to Xi'an-Hankou, Xi'an-Wuwei, Xi'an-Datong, Xi'an-Baotou and other places, connecting east, west, north and south, forming a radial railway network. In terms of the electrical industry, the completion of the Sanmenxia Reservoir and the construction of flood control dams on Shaanxi's Wuding River, Yan River, Wei River, Jing River, Luo River, etc., can build hydropower stations to supply electricity to cities and rural areas. The erection of high-voltage lines throughout the province will form a crisscrossing overhead power transmission network. In terms of minerals, in addition to the proven Weibei Coalfield that can be mined on a large scale, a world-rare large molybdenum mine has been discovered in the Qinling Mountains, which are currently being explored. Although the treasures of the Qinling Mountains are still a mystery, this mystery will be revealed in the near future. With the construction of these railways and electricity, more factories and mines will also appear, and the factories currently under construction and the factories that will begin construction are expected to be put into production successively by the end of the first Five-Year Plan and during the second Five-Year Plan. At that time, the economic face of Shaanxi will be completely changed.

    陕西省工业建设的开端
    中共陕西省委工业部长　鲁直
    陕西省是我国经济比较落后的一个省份。解放以前，没有现代化的工业，只有几家中小型的纺织厂和面粉厂。现代化的交通运输工具，只有陇海铁路的潼关到宝鸡一段；国民党反动统治者，虽然曾经叫喊“开发大西北”，但是始终没有什么实际行动。相反的，他们为了围攻和破坏当时的陕甘宁边区，不顾民族和国家的危亡，调集了四十万左右的反动军队，集中在这里进行骚扰。他们建设的不是工厂，而是碉堡和防线；他们挖掘的不是矿山，而是战壕和陷坑。这个本来经济就很落后的地方，让他们糟踏得更是满目疮痍，一片荒凉了。
    解放后仅三年的时间，陕西省的经济很快就恢复到国民党统治时期的最高水平。从1953年起，我们执行了国家的第一个五年计划。陕西地区的工人阶级克服重重困难，在国民党反动派遗留下的战壕和碉堡群上，开始了有计划的工业建设。
    陕西省是祖国的内地，具有发展工业的有利条件，国家从合理分布工业区划的观点出发，确定陕西为第一个五年计划工业建设的重点地区之一，给予我们的工业建设任务十分艰巨。基本建设所占用的土地面积，在西安、咸阳、兴平、宝鸡、鄠县一带，达四十多万亩（其中一部分是为工业服务的民用建筑），目前已经完成了六百余万平方公尺的建筑工程。建筑工程所需要的施工力量近十万人，每年建筑物所需要的钢材约十多万吨，水泥约四十多万吨，砖瓦近十亿块。从这个数字中，不难看出它的规模是多么的巨大。陕西地区的建设速度也是很快的。据初步计算，第一个五年计划中限额以上的项目的投资额，到1957年末，预计可以超额完成8％；今年上半年完成的投资额为去年同期完成的281％。从主要工程的建设速度看，平均可以提前十一个月以上；同样性质的工厂，一个比一个建设得快。例如建设第一个五万锭的纺织厂，历时十一个月，建设第二个同样规模的纺织厂，就只用了八个月，建设第三个十万锭的纺织厂，只要九个月。工程质量也是一个比一个高。
    现在，陕西省的面貌已经改变了。如果你到西安、咸阳、兴平、宝鸡一带去观光一下，你所看到的，已经不再是碉堡和城壕，而是一片一片的整齐崭新的厂房和职工宿舍。到处听到的，也是建筑机械的转动声和运输材料的火车、汽车的鸣笛声。
    随着大规模工业建设的开始，交通运输事业也在迅速发展。横贯祖国西北、西南的大动脉——宝成铁路，已经全线接轨了。
    像这样大规模的工业和铁道建设，如果没有当地出产的煤炭作燃料，而靠远地运输供给，它将会给工业生产带来多大的损失。陕西的煤炭蕴藏量，是很丰富的。仅据现在探明的渭北煤田，储量即达五十余亿吨，估计陕西全省的煤藏量，将达五百亿吨左右。根据西北煤田地质勘探局的资料，在渭北煤田的铜川矿区，截至今年7月底，已经交出了十一个井口的地质精查资料，其储量达四亿多吨。到今年底，在这个地区还可交出十亿吨的精查储量资料，它可以满足第二个五年计划在这个地区建井的需要。目前在铜川地区的新建矿井和改建矿井，已经完成了两个改建工程，新建的铜川的王家河一号二号井和三里洞竖井，不久也将投入生产。第一个五年计划的建井任务预计可以提前和超额完成国家计划。而第二个五年计划的建井工程，也正在积极地进行准备工作。
    建设这样规模的工业和铁道，困难是很多的。但是，陕西地区的工人没有在困难面前低头，他们以要“高山低头，河水让路”的精神，依靠集体力量和集体智慧，克服了建设中所遇到的一切困难。自今年3月党中央发出了开展先进生产者运动的号召后，在全省范围内广泛的开展了社会主义竞赛和先进生产者运动。半年来，这个运动已形成了规模宏大的群众性运动。据十一个行业的统计，参加厂际竞赛的有二百五十八个单位，提出保证完成生产条件的有七万五千多人，突破旧定额，创造新纪录的单位和个人约占职工的30％以上，提出各项合理化建议两万多条，推广了各种先进经验一千余项，涌现出先进生产单位五百六十三个，评选出先进生产者三万多人。这些先进单位和先进人物，在建设工作中都起了带头作用，像建筑木工傅阿坤经过几个月的研究，创造了自动打夯机，一人能管两部，一部打夯机一天等于六十四人的工作量。门窗工张敏才，创造了四刃刨，工效提高了三倍多。这样的例子不胜枚举。
    陕西地区没有现成的建设人材，因此，这给工业建设带来很大困难，怎么办呢？陕西省领导部门采取了在建设过程中，普遍地组织在职干部进行学习来解决干部不足的困难。没有文化的学文化，没有技术的学技术。几年来，工业建设人材，已经从无到有，从少到多，从完全不懂到懂。但是，目前的干部数量和质量，仍然不能满足发展的需要，干部的缺额不是几十、几百、几千，而是几万。解决的办法，还是只有“自力更生”，除了国家在学校培养外，今年组织了大量的工人和干部进行在职学习。根据5月份不完全统计，已经开办了文化、技术业余学校六百六十五处，参加学习的职工已达十五万人。而有些单位参加学习的人数竟达职工的97％以上。经过这样一边工作，一边学习，就可以生长出大批的干部来。像第一棉纺织厂，采用这样的办法，两三年来，他们培养提拔了六百多个干部。特别是在党中央提出十二年内赶上世界科学技术水平的号召后，广大职工向文化科学进军的热潮更广泛地高涨起来了，有些单位工程技术人员的在职学习计划，要在十二年内达到副博士的学术水平。
    上面这些，仅仅是陕西地区工业建设的开始，更大规模的建设，还在后面，第二个和第三个五年计划，将有更大的任务摆在陕西地区的工人面前。从陕西的地理条件和地下蕴藏来看，工业建设发展的前途是广阔的。对开发祖国大西北的丰富宝藏，陕西省将是一个前进基地。在运输方面，西安将是全国最大的铁路枢纽之一，它以陇海线为骨干，除了西兰、宝成之外，还将要通向西（安）汉（汉口）、西（安）武（武威）、西（安）同（大同）、西（安）包（包头）等地，东西南北，四通八达，将形成一个辐射状的铁路网。在电气工业方面，三门峡水库的建成，和陕西无定河、延河、渭河、泾河、?河、洛河的拦洪坝的兴建，都可以建设水力发电站，供应城市和农村的用电，全省高压线路的架设，将会形成一个纵横交织的空中输电网。在矿产方面，除掉已探明的渭北大煤田可供大规模开采外，目前正在勘探的秦岭山脉，已发现了一个世界稀有的大钼矿；秦岭的宝藏虽然现在还是一个谜，但不久的将来，就会把这个谜识破。随着这些铁路和电气的建设，更多的工厂矿山也将要出现，而现在正在进行建设的工厂和将要开始建设的工厂预期在第一个五年计划末和第二个五年计划期间，都要先后投入生产。那时候，陕西的经济面貌，就将完全改变了。
