    Strange Sailing Junk
    After the liberation of the coastal islands of Zhejiang, people lived peaceful and happy lives. On July 12th, members of the No. 17 Production Team of the Honghua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Waiyang Township, Yongjia County, Zhejiang, discovered a sailing junk moored under the secluded rocks of "Wuren Ao" (无人岙, literally "No Man's Cove") on the river surface of Shatou Village when they went to Xiawan to plow sweet potato fields. This sailing junk was not seen yesterday afternoon when they finished work; it must have sailed in last night! What did it sail to the mountainous area for? Why didn't it stop at Putou but at "Wuren Ao"? Some of the members raised questions and began to pay attention to this sailing junk from another place.
    In the afternoon, after work, they decided to row a small boat to see what was going on. They climbed onto the sailing junk and saw that it was an empty boat. They went down into the cabin to check and found bread, biscuits, cake, a new biscuit tin with foreign writing on it, and an expensive "Taiwan mat." They thought: these are not things that fishermen and boat bosses would eat. At this time, Vice-Director Yu Chonglong found a dirty bullet belt sewn from white cotton cloth under the blanket, exactly like the ones confiscated during the suppression of bandits in the early days of liberation. At this point, they were convinced that this was a bandit boat. Yu Chonglong immediately took the bullet belt to report to the township government. The township government and the Party branch immediately mobilized more than forty militiamen to lie in ambush and wait.
    A Struggle in the Family
    Late on the night of July 12th, the Public Security Bureau of the Wenzhou Special District received a report from Yongjia County about signs of special agents attempting to sneak in. Soon after, Dongtou County reported that special agents had also been found landing on Xiaomen Mountain in that county.
    Dongtou County is located in Wenzhou Bay in southeastern Zhejiang and is a water county consisting of many islands. Late on the night of July 10th, on a small island called Xiaomen Mountain in the county, special agent Lin Yishou secretly returned home with another special agent, Zhou Qingbao. As soon as he got home, his wife, Yu Adi, got out of bed and said, "A few days ago, we had a meeting here, and the government wants us to find a way to persuade you to come back and surrender. If you come back, our family will be reunited. Don't go to sea anymore; surrender tomorrow!" Lin Yishou's eighty-year-old mother also cried and said, "Ah Shou! It's good that you're back! The government is really lenient now. Don't go to sea again!" His brother, Lin Shoufa, also told him, "We have collectivized here, and the boats have all entered the cooperative. Now we are short of captains. It would be great if you stayed and worked on our boat!"
    "Is the government really lenient and won't kill us?" Lin Yishou asked.
    "Don't worry, would your own brother deceive you?!" Lin Shoufa explained: "Several prisoners from Yijiangshan (Island) have returned. A Ting from Dongyu and Xiangpeng from Damen Mountain were given travel expenses when they returned, and they were provided with food. They are being taken care of very well. Now they are all working at home, and their lives are not bad!" Lin Yishou's niece, Lin Songmei, the deputy director of the cooperative and a member of the Communist Youth League, also mobilized him to surrender.
    Zhou Qingbao, the leader of the special agent team who came to Lin's house with Lin Yishou, asked Lin Songmei, "If the crime is very serious, and they are arrested and commit a serious crime again, will it be lenient for those who are now 'big shots' outside (i.e., core members of the bandits and special agents)?!"
    "As long as you sincerely repent, no matter how serious the crime was in the past, you can be treated leniently. If you report and perform meritorious service, you will also be rewarded for handing over the weapons you brought to the government," Songmei explained to the bandits earnestly.
    They were special agents of the so-called "Kuocang Mountain Action Team" sent by the Chiang gang's intelligence bureau. The whole group consisted of six people. In addition to the leader Zhou Qingbao and member Lin Yishou, there were four others waiting on the boat. Before "entering the area," they had made their plans: first go to Lin Yishou's home on Xiaomen Mountain and use it as a "foothold" and "liaison station." After arriving at Xiaomen Mountain, they would sink the sailing junk used for smuggling to avoid being discovered; then, Lin Yishou's relatives and friends would get a local small boat to send the special agents Chen Yiping, Li Yuqin, and Lin Bangzhe into the Kuocang Mountain area to carry out so-called "enemy rear guerrilla warfare" and establish a "base." Then send the "captain" Zhou Qingbao and the "radio operator" Pan Zhouhong to Wenzhou City to lie dormant. The task of building a transportation boat was left to Lin Yishou in Xiaomen Mountain.
    Now, everything has become a pipe dream. Lin Yishou was a little shaken. Zhou Qingbao quickly urged, "Ah Shou! Go! Go! The tide is going out soon!" Lin Yishou said to Lin Songmei, "It's okay to surrender, but there are four brothers on the boat, and we need to discuss it with them. If we surrender, we'll come back tomorrow night; if we don't come, we'll go our separate ways. If you report (to the government), it won't do you any good!"
    The two special agents hurriedly returned to the boat. After a period of panic, fear, mutual blame, and quarrels among the special agents, they risked sailing the foreign boat into the Ou River. On the night of the 11th, they abandoned the boat on the Meiao bank of the Oujiang River in Yongjia County and fled to the Kuocang Mountain area.
    Lin Shoufa and his daughter from Xiaomen Mountain were not intimidated by the enemy, nor did they have any concerns because of their family relationship. Early the next morning, Lin Songmei reported the events of the previous night in detail to the People's Government.
      Everywhere there were vigilant people
    After the special agents landed, they traveled by day and hid by night, taking mountain paths and detours to avoid being discovered, but they could not escape the eyes of the broad masses of people. On the 13th, a farmer from Waiyang Township reported to the public security personnel that on the night of the 11th, he was grabbed by six guys with short guns to lead the way. On the night of the 13th, two farmers from Qiaotou Township also reported that before dawn on the 12th, they met six strangers wearing blue cloth shirts on their way to Wenzhou who forced them to carry things. On the 15th, a farmer from Yonglin District reported that he had encountered six suspicious people carrying four square boxes towards Liulong Township, Yongjia County, after midnight on the 13th. The same situation was successively discovered by cadres of the Qianshang Village Cooperative and four hunters in Yonglin District. On the afternoon of the 18th, the person in charge of the Yongjia County Public Security Bureau met Wu Guanghai, the village security guard committee member and people's representative who had discovered the enemy's radio station and other things and ran to the district to report.
    Wu Guanghai, on this morning, went up the mountain with two other young farmers from Zhangdang Village, Mingao Township, Pan Taixun and Pan Guangting, to pull dragon beard grass. They passed in front of a cave in Shikeng Mountain and found that the grass at the entrance of the cave was a bit messy, as if someone had trampled on it. They thought: very few people come to this high mountain on weekdays, who would drill into the cave? The three young men decided to climb into the cave to see. Less than a few feet into the cave, they found charcoal and cigarette ashes. The young men became more vigilant, mustered their courage, and continued to climb into the cave, finally discovering binoculars, bullet belts, and two heavy square boxes, one of which had a section of wire exposed. Wu Guanghai immediately ran to the district and township governments to report.
      The surrender of a special agent
    On the evening of July 19th, the special agents fled to the home of Lin Bangzhe's sister in Sunkeng Village, Guiao Township, Qingtian County. This place is very close to Lin Bangzhe's own home and is the area where he used to engage in bandit activities. He wanted to rely on his relatives and former bandit gangs to carry out activities here. As soon as he entered the door, he asked his sister about the situation of some people, and learned that some of those who had been bandits with him in the past had been arrested, and some had registered and reformed long ago. That night, his sister and niece persuaded him to surrender. Early the next morning, his nephew Sun Chengfen's wife, Communist Youth League member Lin Sancui, and Lin Bangzhe's younger brother, Lin Bangjian, also came to mobilize Lin Bangzhe and other special agents to surrender.
    The special agents knew that they could not stay here either. They scattered on the evening of the next day, abandoning the radio station, pistols, etc., at Lin Bangzhe's home. Lin Bangzhe witnessed that all plans had failed. Where could he go if he ran again? He decided not to go. He hid in the nearby mountains. On the evening of the 22nd, he ran into his distant cousin Lin Xinan in the mountains. On the evening of the 23rd, when he secretly returned home, he met a good friend surnamed Zhu from the past. They all advocated that he quickly surrender.
    At this time, the troops and public security personnel participating in the pursuit of this armed special agent learned that most of the special agents had fled. After Lin Bangzhe returned home, he did not surrender to the government, hid in the east and west, and did not hand over his guns. Therefore, Lin Bangzhe was arrested on the evening of the 23rd, and evidence of crimes such as radio stations, codes, and guns were seized. After Lin Bangzhe was arrested, it was discovered that he had begun to confess to the government before his arrest. The Canadian gun and bullets he used had been handed over to the township clerk, and the whereabouts of other special agents had been verbally confessed. With the help of his friends, he began to write a "confession."
      How the "captain" was caught
      Zhou Qingbao, the "captain" of the "Kuocang Mountain Action Team," and another special agent, Chen Yiping, who had "planned" to escape back to Matsu before the Mid-Autumn Festival, boarded a bus to Linhai at the Hongqiao Railway Station north of Yueqing County on the morning of July 23. When the car arrived at Shuizhang (place name), they were detained by public security personnel.
    They were caught like this: When the bus was still crossing the Qingjiang Ferry north of Hongqiao, the ferryman Chen Guanglai found the middle-aged passenger wearing a blue checkered shirt and yellow socks very familiar. "Well, isn't that A Bao (Zhou Qingbao's nickname)?" He looked at the back of the middle-aged passenger carefully. "Yes, it's him!" A Bao was originally from their village and was a bandit. He had been subjected to labor reform in 1950 and was released, but he fled to the sea again and had been out of contact ever since. He thought: if this guy gets on the bus and leaves, I don't know what bad things he will do somewhere. What to do? Chen Guanglai told Li Yuwa, the deputy director of the Wenzhou Central Station of the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Transportation Bureau, who was working in Linhai on the same car, about the situation, and asked him to find a way along the way. At this time, the car had driven ashore, and the passengers were about to get on the car. Li Yuwa asked Chen Guanglai to get on the gasoline truck in front and rush to the People's Committee of Baixi Township to report first. Deputy Director Li himself drove the charcoal truck that Zhou Qingbao was riding in. The car drove very slowly and deliberately stopped to repair twice on the road. In this way, when the car arrived at Shuizhang, the director of the Dajing Police Station and the reconnaissance section chief of the County Public Security Bureau were already waiting. Zhou Qingbao and Chen Yiping, who were being hunted down, were caught in this way.
            None can escape
    The special agents Li Yuqin and Lin Yishou fled to Zhuji County on July 23. On the third night, they were watching Shaoxing opera and drinking in a small restaurant. Just as they were about to raise their glasses to drink, they were arrested by public security personnel in accordance with the law.
    The only special agent of the "Kuocang Mountain Action Team" who had not been caught at this time was the "radio operator" Pan Zhouhong. According to reconnaissance: he had arrived in Linhai County.
    At noon on August 3, Pan Mingda and his wife and a young man secretly met under Jinshan Mountain on the edge of Linhai City. According to the young man's clothing, facial features, and other circumstantial evidence obtained in the reconnaissance, the public security personnel judged that this was Pan Zhouhong meeting with his parents. The young man nervously handed Pan Mingda a package. They talked a few words in a hurry and then separated. The public security personnel intercepted the young man and interrogated him: "What do you do?" "I sell sesame cakes and fried dough sticks in Shanghai." "Where do you live in Shanghai?" "The Bund." "Which street? What's the house number?" "I... I can't remember." "How much does your sesame cake sell for?" "This... this... my brain is not good." "Your brain is not good? I heard that you knock hammers pretty well." (Note: "Knocking hammers" means sending telegrams. This is jargon among special agents.) "No, no, I don't knock hammers. I haven't graduated from elementary school." "What does 'knocking hammers' mean? How do you know the conditions for knocking hammers?
    The young man lowered his head and remained silent.
    "What is this?" The public security personnel picked up the highly toxic poison found on him.
    "This... this... is... tonic."
      "Do you want to take some tonic?"
    The cunning special agent's face turned green, and his legs kept shaking: "This... this... is... poison."

    奇怪的海帆船
    浙江沿海岛屿解放后，人们都过着和平幸福的生活。7月12日这天，浙江永嘉县外洋乡洪华农业生产合作社第十七生产队的社员们，在到下湾去犁蕃薯田的时候，发现沙头村江面上老乡们叫它“无人岙”的那个僻静的山岩下，停泊着一艘海帆船。这艘海帆船，昨天下午收工的时候还没有见到，它一定是昨晚驶来的！驶到山区来干什么？为什么不停在浦头而停在“无人岙”？社员中有人发生了疑问，并开始注意这艘外地来的海帆船。
    下午，收了工，他们决定划一只小船去看个究竟。他们爬上海帆船一看，原来是个空船。他们走下舱在舱内查看，才发现船上有面包、饼干、蛋糕和一个有洋文字的新的饼干桶，还有一床名贵的“台湾席”。他们想：这些都不会是渔民和船老大食用的东西。这时，副社长虞崇龙又从被子底下找到了一条白土布缝的肮脏的子弹带，它和解放初期剿匪时缴获的一模一样。这时他们认定这是一只土匪船。虞崇龙便马上拿着这条子弹带报告了乡政府。乡政府和党支部马上动员了四十多个民兵埋伏下来守候。
    家庭里的斗争
    12日深夜，温州专署公安处接到永嘉县发现特务偷渡迹象的报告。不久，洞头县又报告了该县小门山也发现特务分子登陆的情况。
    洞头县在浙东南温州湾内，是一个由许多岛屿组成的水上县。7月10日深夜，在该县一个叫小门山的小岛上，特务分子林益寿带着另一个特务分子周庆宝偷偷地回家了。他一到家，妻子虞阿娣从床上爬了起来说：“前几天我们这里开了会，政府要我们想办法劝你们回来投案。你回来我们一家子就算团圆了。你再也不要下海了，天明就自首去！”林益寿的八十多岁的母亲也哭着说：“阿寿呀！你回来的好！现在政府真宽大。这回可再不要下海啦！”他的哥哥林寿法也告诉他：“我们这里合作化了，船都进了社，现在正缺老大，你就留在我们船上工作多好啊！”
    “政府真的宽大不杀我们？”林益寿反问。
    “放心吧，亲兄弟还会骗你？！”林寿法解释说：“一江山（岛）的俘虏好几个回来了。东屿的阿亭，大门山祥朋，回来时政府还发给了路费，照样供应粮食，对他们都很照顾。现在都在家劳动，生活过得不坏！”林益寿的侄女、合作社副社长、青年团员林松梅也动员他投案。
    跟着林益寿来到林家的特务组长周庆宝就问林松梅说：“如果罪恶很大，抓去又重犯，现在在外面当大的（即匪特骨干），会不会宽大？！”
    “只要真心悔过，不论过去罪恶多大，都可以得到宽大处理。如果检举立功，把带来的武器交给政府还有奖励。”松梅认真地向匪徒解释。
    他们原是蒋帮情报局派遣来的所谓“括苍山行动队”的特务分子，全组共六名，除队长周庆宝和队员林益寿外，还有四个在船上等着。他们在“入区”以前，就打好了如意算盘：先到小门山林益寿的家里，把这里作为“立足点”和“联络站”。到达小门山以后，就把偷渡用的海帆船沉没，避免被发觉；然后由林益寿的亲友搞一条当地的小船，把特务分子陈一平、李玉琴、林邦者送进括苍山区，去开展所谓“敌后游击”，建立“根据地”。再把“队长”周庆宝和“电台长”潘舟弘送到温州市潜伏下来。筹建交通船的任务由林益寿留在小门山办理。
    现在，一切都成了泡影。林益寿就有些动摇。周庆宝连忙催促着：“阿寿！走！走！快退潮了！”林益寿便对林松梅说：“自首可以，但船上还有四个兄弟，要跟他们商量商量。如果自首，明晚再来；不来就各走各的。你们如果去报告（政府），对你们没有好处！”
    两个特务就匆匆忙忙地回到了船上，特务分子们在一片慌乱、恐惧和互相埋怨争吵之后，把这只外海船冒险地驶进了瓯江。11日晚上他们在永嘉县瓯江北岸梅岙弃船上岸，向括苍山区逃窜。
    小门山的林寿法父女，并没有被敌人吓唬住，也没有因为亲属关系有什么顾虑。第二天一早林松梅就把昨天晚上发生的事件详细地报告了人民政府。
      到处都是警觉的人们
    特务分子上岸后，为了不被发觉，他们昼伏夜行，抄山径、绕小路，但总瞒不过广大群众的眼睛。13日，外洋乡的一个农民向公安人员反映：11日晚上，他被六个带短枪的家伙抓去带路。13日晚上，又有桥头乡的两个农民也来报告：12日黎明前，他们在去温州的路上遇着六个穿青布衫的陌生人强迫他们挑东西。15日，永临区的一个农民反映：他在13日午夜过后曾碰到六个行迹可疑的人，背着四个方形盒子向永嘉县六龙乡方向走去。同样的情况还被前上村合作社干部和永临区的四个猎户相继发现。18日下午，永嘉县公安机关的负责人又在碧莲区接见了发现敌人的电台等跑来区里报告的村治安保卫委员、人民代表吴光海。
    吴光海，在这天早上，和茗岙乡章当村的其他两个青年农民潘太勋、潘光庭上山拔龙须草。他们经过石坑山一个岩洞的前边，发现洞口的草有些凌乱，好像有人践踏过。他们想：这高山上平日很少人来，谁还会钻到洞里去呢？三个青年人便决定爬进洞里去看看。进洞不到几尺的光景，他们发现了木炭和香烟灰，青年人更加警惕起来，鼓着勇气继续爬进洞去，终于发现了望远镜、子弹带和两个沉重的方形盒子，其中一个还露出了一截电线来。吴光海就立即跑到区、乡政府去报告。
      一个特务分子的缴械
    7月19日晚上，特务分子们逃到了青田县贵岙乡孙坑村林邦者的姐姐家里。这里离林邦者自己的家很近，是他过去当土匪活动的地区。他想在这里依靠自己的亲属和从前的匪伙进行活动。他一进门就向他姐姐打问一些人的情况，知道以前和他一起当土匪的那些人有的被捕了，有的早就登记自新了。当天晚上他的姐姐、外甥女都劝他投案自首。第二天一早，他的外甥孙承芬的妻子、青年团员林三翠和林邦者的弟弟林邦俭也来动员林邦者和其他特务分子投案。
    特务分子们知道在这里也呆不下去，在第二天晚上逃散了，把电台、手枪等都扔在林邦者的家里。林邦者目睹一切计划都破产了，再走，到哪里去呢？他决定不走了，跑在附近山里躲藏起来。22日晚上，他在山里碰到了他的远房哥哥林溪南。23日晚上当他偷偷地回到家里的时候，又遇上过去的一个姓朱的好朋友。他们都主张他快去投案。
    这时，参加追剿这股武装特务的部队和我公安人员了解到：特务分子已经大部逃散。林邦者回家后也没有向政府自新，东藏西躲，枪支未交。因此，就在23日晚上把林邦者逮捕，并缴获了电台、密码、枪支等罪证。逮捕林邦者后，发觉他在被捕前已在开始向政府坦白，他自己用的那支加拿大枪和子弹已交给了乡文书，口头交代了其他特务分子的去向，并在他的朋友的帮助下开始写“坦白书”。
      “队长”是这样落网的
      “计划”在旧历中秋以前逃回马祖的“括苍山行动队”队长周庆宝和另一个特务分子陈一平，23日上午在乐清县以北的虹桥车站搭上了去临海的汽车。车到水涨（地名）的时候，他们就被公安人员拘留了。
    他们是这样落网的：当汽车还在虹桥以北的清江渡过渡的时候，渡工陈光来发现这个穿蓝格子衬衫、黄色短袜的中年旅客很面熟。“嗯，不就是阿宝（周庆宝的小名）吗？”他望着这个中年旅客的背影仔细地打量了一番。“不错，正是他！”阿宝原是他们村子里的，是个土匪。1950年劳动改造过，被释放后又逃下海去，一直没有音信。他想：如果这家伙上车走了，还不知要到什么地方干出什么坏事来。怎么办呢？陈光来就把情况告诉了同车到临海去工作的浙江省公路运输局温州中心站副站长李裕哇，要他沿途想办法。这时，汽车已开上岸来，旅客们快要上车走了。李裕哇便叫陈光来坐上前面的汽油车，先赶到白溪乡人民委员会去报告，李副站长自己来开周庆宝坐的这辆木炭汽车。车子开得很慢，又在路上故意地停车修理两次。这样，车子到水涨的时候，大荆派出所的所长和县公安局的侦察股长早已在等候着。正在侦捕中的周庆宝和陈一平就这样落网了。
            一个也逃不掉
    特务分子李玉琴和林益寿，7月23日逃到诸暨县，第三天晚上，他们看罢绍兴戏坐在一家小菜馆里喝酒，正待举杯欲饮，就被公安人员依法逮捕了。
    “括苍山行动队”的特务分子这时没有落网的还有“电台长”潘舟弘。据侦察：他已到了临海县城。
    8月3日中午，在临海城边的巾山下，潘明达夫妇和一个年轻人秘密地相会了。公安人员根据这个青年的衣着、面貌特征以及侦察中所获得的其他旁证材料，判断这是潘舟弘和他的父母在会面。年轻人紧张地递给潘明达一包东西。他们匆匆忙忙地谈了几句话就分手了。公安人员截住了这个年轻人进行盘问：“你是干什么的？”“我是上海卖烧饼、油条的。”“你在上海住在哪里？”“外滩。”“哪条街道？门牌多少号。”“我……我记不清了。”“你的烧饼卖多少钱一个？”这……这……我脑子不好。”“你脑子不好？听说你敲鎯头敲得不坏。”（按：“敲鎯头”就是发电报。这是特务分子中的黑话。）“不，不，我不是敲鎯头的。我高小还没有毕业。”“什么叫‘敲鎯头’？你怎么还知道敲鎯头的条件。
    年轻人低着头默默无语。
    “这是什么？”公安人员拿起从他身上搜到的烈性毒药。
    “这……这是……补药。”
      “你补一补？”
    这个狡猾的特务分子脸上发青，两腿不断地抖动：“这……这……是……毒药。”
