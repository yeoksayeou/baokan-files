    The Nature of "Fixed Interest"
    Su Xing

    Recently, academic circles have discussed the nature of the "fixed interest" of joint state-private enterprises, and put forward several different views. The central question is: Is "fixed interest" surplus value?

    This is a very practical question. Correctly understanding this question will help us understand the nature of joint state-private enterprises, as well as the relationship between workers and capitalists within the enterprise after the joint venture.

    Surplus value, as a category of political economy, is the theoretical expression of capitalist relations of production. Therefore, to examine whether "fixed interest" is surplus value, we must see what changes have taken place in capitalist relations of production after the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry.

    Capitalist relations of production are based on the capitalist ownership of the means of production. Capitalist ownership is mainly manifested in two aspects economically: First, the capitalist has full power to dispose of, handle, and use his means of production; second, he can, by virtue of his ownership of the means of production, occupy the surplus labor of workers.

    After the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry, these two aspects have obviously undergone fundamental changes. The first manifestation of ownership of the means of production, although restricted before the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry, still gave capitalists the right to manage and operate and the right to transfer personnel at that time. Now, these powers have been completely transferred to the hands of the socialist state. The second manifestation of capitalist ownership has not been completely abolished, but they can no longer expand the exploitation of workers by various means, and can only receive a fixed "dividend."

    The change in the ownership of the means of production has fundamentally changed the position of workers and capitalists in production. From the worker's point of view, in joint state-private enterprises, he has become the master of the enterprise. Because the interests of enterprise production and the interests of the workers themselves tend to be consistent, the workers' production enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm have been greatly improved. From the capitalist's point of view, because they have given up the power to dispose of, handle, and use the means of production, they have acquired two identities in the enterprise: the identity of engineering and technical personnel and management personnel, and the identity of capitalists. The former identity shows that they are becoming socialist laborers; the latter identity shows that they are still exploiters.

    In this way, in joint state-private enterprises, labor is no longer a commodity. Because first, the working class has basically become the owner of the means of production, and it is not necessary for him to sell labor to himself; second, what the working class gets is no longer the value of labor, but all the labor products, or all the newly created value, except for the "fixed interest." These labor products, partly to meet personal needs and partly for social needs, are all for the labor of the working class itself, which Marx once collectively referred to as necessary labor. However, this is one aspect of the matter. On the other hand, in joint state-private enterprises, there are still remnants of capitalist ownership. The labor done by workers is not all necessary labor. In addition to necessary labor, they must also do some surplus labor. This part of labor will be occupied by the capitalists without compensation as "fixed interest."

    The matter looks very clear. "Fixed interest" is by no means distributed according to labor, but according to capital. It is a special form of capitalists occupying the workers' unpaid labor by virtue of the ownership of the means of production. Therefore, it is essentially still surplus value.

    Of course, surplus value is a category that expresses typical capitalist relations, and may not be completely suitable for the situation of "fixed interest." However, from the essence of the matter, "fixed interest" cannot but be归结 (concluded) to such a category.

    Some people say: In joint state-private enterprises, "labor is no longer a commodity, nor is it expressed as value. The economic category of surplus value can no longer be established in this case." I do not completely agree with this statement. It is true that in joint state-private enterprises, labor is no longer a commodity, but, as mentioned above, the boundary between necessary labor and surplus labor has not disappeared. There, some of the labor of workers is indeed occupied by capitalists as unpaid labor. Marx often said: Surplus value is nothing more than the capitalist form of surplus labor, and said: "No matter what special forms (profit, interest or rent) surplus value may later crystallize into, it is essentially the embodiment of unpaid labor time." ("Das Kapital," Volume 1, page 656) I think these statements are helpful for us to understand the nature of "fixed interest." Of course, saying that labor is not a commodity in joint state-private enterprises and that "fixed interest" is surplus value seems to have some defects in "logic." However, the problem is that joint state-private enterprises are a transitional relationship, a process of socialist relations of production replacing capitalist relations of production. When a thing is in the process of change, especially when the new quality has expanded and only some remnants of the old quality are left, some variant forms will inevitably occur. Although it is developing logically, it often conflicts with the original "logic."

    Some people say: Now capitalists actually have no ownership of the means of production, and "dividends" are just periodically paid redemption money, which is no longer surplus value. This opinion also fails to convince people. In fact, "fixed interest" just proves that the capitalist ownership of the means of production has not been completely abolished, and it still has economic manifestations. I feel that this statement is due to a lack of good understanding of the relationship between our redemption policy and the transformation of capitalist relations of production. There is no doubt that we are changing the capitalist ownership of the means of production into socialist ownership by adopting a redemption policy. This policy did not begin after the joint venture of the entire industry, but before that. However, our redemption of capitalists is not paid with "national accumulation." Our redemption money is to allow capitalists to occupy a part of surplus value for a certain period of time. This part of surplus value has taken the form of 10% to 30% reasonable profit, the form of "four horses dividing the fat," and now it takes the form of "fixed interest." Although "fixed interest" is very different from "four horses dividing the fat," their sources are the same, that is, the surplus labor of the working class. I believe that in studying China's state capitalism economy in the transition period, we must link the redemption policy with the economic process of transforming capitalist relations of production into socialist relations of production, so as to comprehensively understand the characteristics of China's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

    Some people say: "The fixed interest obtained by capitalists does not increase due to the increase of enterprise profits, nor does it decrease due to the decrease of enterprise profits, and even in the case of enterprise losses (of course, this situation is very rare), capitalists are guaranteed to obtain the same amount of profit (because it is "fixed interest"). These facts clearly show that this part of value (fixed interest) occupied by capitalists without compensation is not only created by the workers of this enterprise, but also includes the entire working class, including the workers of state-owned enterprises." Therefore, fixed interest is no longer surplus value. This statement is even more untenable. Yes, fixed interest is generally distributed through specialized companies, but whether it is a specialized company or other economic institutions, what they distribute can only be the value already created by the working class. As for whether this part of the value is created by the workers of the enterprise is not important. Not to mention that this part of value generally does not include the part created by workers in state-owned enterprises, even if it includes a little bit, from the class point of view: the capitalist class always occupies a part of the surplus labor of the working class. Marx pointed out when examining typical capitalist production: Due to the equalization of profits, the surplus value occupied by capitalists is often not equal to the surplus value produced by their enterprises, but this situation will not change the fact that profit is a transformed form of surplus value.

    The question of whether "fixed interest" is surplus value is not merely a conceptual dispute, but a principled difference. As everyone knows: the reason why capital is capital is precisely because it can bring surplus value. Therefore, denying that "fixed interest" is surplus value will deny the remnants of capitalist ownership of the means of production, deny the identity of capitalists as exploiters, deny the class contradiction between workers and capitalists, and deny the state capitalist nature of joint state-private enterprises. This is not in accordance with the facts. However, our affirmation of this issue does not prevent us from regarding joint state-private enterprises as basically socialist enterprises, regarding capitalists as public officials, and respecting their due powers. At the same time, it will have the following benefits: It will enable us to more comprehensively understand the changes in the relations of production in joint state-private enterprises, and see clearly our tasks ahead: preparing to turn it into a completely socialist state-owned enterprise at an appropriate time.

    “定息”的性质问题
    苏星
    最近，学术界对公私合营企业“定息”的性质问题，进行了讨论，提出了若干不同的看法，中心的问题在于：“定息”是不是剩余价值。
    这是个很实际的问题，正确地认识这个问题，会帮助我们了解公私合营企业的性质，以及合营以后企业内部工人和资本家之间的关系。
    剩余价值，作为一个政治经济学的范畴是资本主义生产关系在理论上的表现。因此，考察“定息”是不是剩余价值，要看全行业公私合营以后，资本主义生产关系发生了什么样的变化。
    资本主义的生产关系是以资本主义的生产资料所有制作基础的。资本主义所有制在经济上的表现，主要包括两个方面：第一、资本家可以全权支配、处理和运用他的生产资料；第二、他可以凭借对生产资料的所有权，占有工人的剩余劳动。
    全行业公私合营以后，这两个方面显然地都发生了根本的变化。生产资料所有权的第一种表现，虽然在全行业公私合营以前就受到了限制，不过那个时候，资本家还是有经营管理权和人事调配权的，现在，这些权力已经完全转移到了社会主义国家的手里。资本主义所有制的第二种表现还没有完全废除，但是他们已经不可能用种种方法扩大对工人的剥削，只能拿到固定的“股息”。
    生产资料所有制的变化，根本地改变了工人和资本家在生产当中的地位。从工人方面说，在公私合营企业里已经变成了企业的主人，由于企业生产发展的利益和工人本身的利益的趋于一致，大大地提高了工人的生产积极性和劳动热情。从资本家方面说，由于他们放弃了对生产资料支配、处理和运用的权力，就使自己在企业里取得了两重身分：作为工程技术人员和管理人员的身分和资本家的身分。前一种身分表明他们正在变为社会主义的劳动者；后一种身分则表明他们还是一个剥削者。
    这样，在公私合营企业里，劳动力已经不再是商品了。因为第一、工人阶级已经基本上成为生产资料的所有者，他不必要自己向自己出卖劳动力；第二、工人阶级所得到已经不是劳动力的价值，而是除了“定息”以外的全部劳动产品，或全部新创造的价值。这些劳动产品，一部分用来满足个人的需要，一部分用于社会的需要，都是为了工人阶级本身的劳动，马克思曾经把它们统称之为必要劳动。不过，这是事情的一方面，另一方面，在公私合营企业里，还有资本主义所有制的残存部分，工人所做的劳动并不全部都是必要劳动，除了必要劳动以外，还必须做一部分剩余劳动。这一部分劳动作为“定息”会无偿地被资本家所占有。
    事情看起来很清楚，“定息”绝不是按劳动，而是按资本进行分配的，它是资本家凭借生产资料所有权占有工人的无给劳动的特殊形式，因此，实质上还是剩余价值。
    当然，剩余价值是表现典型的资本主义关系的范畴，未必完全适合于“定息”的情况，但是，从事情的本质来看，“定息”又不能不归结为这样的范畴。
    有的人说：在公私合营企业里，“劳动力已经不成为商品，也不表现为价值，剩余价值这一个经济范畴，在这种情况下，就已经不能成立了”。这种说法，我不完全同意。诚然，在公私合营企业里，劳动力已经不再是商品，但是，像前面提到的，必要劳动和剩余劳动的界限并未消失，在那里，工人的劳动确实有一部分是作为无给劳动被资本家占有了。马克思常常说：剩余价值无非是剩余劳动的资本主义形式，又说：“不论剩余价值后来要在怎样的特殊的姿态（利润、利息或地租）上结晶起来，它在实质上总是无给劳动时间的体化。”（“资本论”，第一卷，第六五六页）我认为这些说法，对我们理解“定息”的性质是有帮助的。固然，说在公私合营企业里劳动力不是商品，又说“定息”是剩余价值，在“逻辑”上似乎有些缺陷。不过，问题在于，公私合营企业是一种过渡性质的关系，是社会主义生产关系代替资本主义生产关系的过程，一件事物处在变化当中，特别是在新的质已经扩大，旧的质只剩下一些残余的情况下，不可避免地会产生一些变异的形态，它本身虽然在合乎逻辑的发展，却往往和原有的“逻辑”发生冲突。
    有的人说：现在资本家实际上对生产资料已经没有所有权了，“股息”只是定期支付的赎金，已经不再是剩余价值。这种意见也无法使人同意。其实“定息”恰恰证明资本主义生产资料所有制没有完全废除，它还有经济上的表现。我感到这种说法是由于没有很好地了解我们的赎买政策和改造资本主义生产关系之间的联系。毫无疑问的，我们把资本主义的生产资料所有制改变为社会主义所有制，采取的是赎买政策，这个政策不是在全行业合营以后，而是在这以前就开始了的。但是，我们向资本家进行赎买，并不是用“国家的积累”来支付，我们的赎金就是允许资本家在一定时期占有一部分剩余价值。这部分剩余价值采取过10％到30％的合理利润的形式，采取过“四马分肥”的形式，现在则采取“定息”的形式。“定息”虽然和“四马分肥”有了很大的不同，但是它们的来源是一样的，都是工人阶级的剩余劳动。我认为在研究我国过渡时期的国家资本主义经济的时候，必须把赎买政策和资本主义生产关系转变为社会主义生产关系的经济过程联系起来，这样，才能全面地了解我国对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的特点。
    有的人说：“资本家所获得的定息，不因企业利润的增加，也不因企业利润的减少，甚至在企业亏蚀的情况下（当然这种情况极少），也保证资本家获得同样多的利润（因为是“定息”），这些事实明显地说明：资本家无偿占有的这一部分价值（定息），并不仅仅是本企业工人所创造的，而是包括国营企业的工人在内的全体工人阶级所创造的。”因此，定息已经不是剩余价值。这种说法就更站不住脚了。是的，定息一般的是通过专业公司来分配的，但是不论专业公司也好，其他经济机构也好，它们所分配的只能是工人阶级已经创造出来的价值。至于这部分价值是不是本企业的工人所创造的并不重要。姑且不说这部分价值一般的并不包括国营企业工人所创造的部分，即或包括一点点，从阶级的观点上看：资本家阶级总是占有了工人阶级的一部分剩余劳动。马克思在考察典型的资本主义生产的时候曾经指出：由于利润的平均化，资本家所占有的剩余价值往往和他们的企业所生产的剩余价值并不相等，但是，这种情形丝毫都不会改变利润是剩余价值的转化形式。
    “定息”是不是剩余价值的问题，不单纯是概念上的争执，而是一个原则性的分歧。大家知道：资本之所以是资本，正是因为它能够带来剩余价值，因此，否定“定息”是剩余价值，就会否认资本主义生产资料所有制的残余，否认资本家作为剥削者的身分，否认工人和资本家之间的阶级矛盾，否认公私合营企业的国家资本主义性质。这是不符合事实的。然而，我们肯定了这个问题，并不妨碍我们把公私合营企业看作基本上是社会主义企业，把资方人员当作公职人员，尊重他们应有的职权。同时，会有这样的好处：使我们更全面地了解公私合营企业生产关系的变化，看清楚我们前面的任务：准备在适当时机，把它变为完全的社会主义国营企业。
