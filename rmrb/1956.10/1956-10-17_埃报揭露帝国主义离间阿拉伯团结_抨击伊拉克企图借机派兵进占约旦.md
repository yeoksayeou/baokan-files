Xinhua News Agency, October 16th dispatch from Cairo: "Al Shaab" newspaper editor Salem wrote on October 15th that Iraq is planning to occupy Jordan with the support of the West and Israel on the eve of Jordan's national elections.

Salem, who formerly served as Minister of National Guidance, believes that sending Iraqi troops into Jordan is a Western imperialist plot to undermine Arab unity. He said, "This conspiracy is being plotted by Britain, Israel, and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Said." He pointed out that the United States also supports this plan.

Salem said that his newspaper recently obtained details of a plan jointly formulated by the "London government, the Israeli government, and the Baghdad government headed by Nuri al-Said."

Salem said, "I am now able to reveal this very serious plot by Western imperialism to undermine Arab unity precisely when Arab countries are closing their ranks in order to recover the rights that have long been plundered by Western imperialist forces."

He said that Prime Minister Said has not yet sent Iraqi troops into Jordan because he is waiting to obtain guarantees from Israel that it will not regard this as a hostile act. Salem said that the British Ambassador to Iraq had proposed this guarantee.

He said: "Britain has promised to guarantee that Israel will not take advantage of Iraq's military entry into Jordan, nor will it consider this action a hostile act."

    埃报揭露帝国主义离间阿拉伯团结
    抨击伊拉克企图借机派兵进占约旦
    据新华社16日讯　开罗消息：“人民报”主编萨勒姆10月15日写道，伊拉克正在计划在约旦举行全国选举的前夕借助西方和以色列的支持占领约旦。
    这位曾任国家指导部长的萨勒姆认为派遣伊拉克军队开入约旦是西方帝国主义企图破坏阿拉伯团结的阴谋。他说，“这个阴谋是由英国、以色列和伊拉克首相赛义德策划的。”他指出，美国也支持这计划。
    萨勒姆说，他的报纸最近已经获得了一个由“伦敦政府、以色列政府和以努里·赛义德为首的巴格达政府”共同制定的计划的细节。
    萨勒姆说，“我现在能够揭露正当阿拉伯国家为了收复它们长期以来被西方帝国主义力量剥夺了的权利而紧密它们的队伍的时候西方帝国主义企图破坏阿拉伯团结的这个非常严重的阴谋。”
    他说，赛义德首相还没有让伊拉克军队开入约旦，是要等待取得以色列的保证，不会把它看作是敌对行动。萨勒姆说，英国驻伊拉克大使提出了这个保证。
    他说：“英国已经答应保证以色列将不会利用伊拉克军队进入约旦的行动，并且也不会把这个行动认为是敌对行动。”
