    In the Face of a Disaster Unseen in Fifty Years
    ——Qianjin Cooperative Strives for Increased Income for 90% of its Members
                By Our Reporter Zhen Weimin
    On September 4th, Huaiyin Special District in Jiangsu Province was hit by a level 10 typhoon, resulting in flooding across the entire district. Whether agricultural cooperatives in the severely affected areas have the strength to overcome natural disasters is a question of utmost concern. To understand this issue specifically, I visited the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Huaiyin County, a severely affected area of Huaiyin Special District.
    The Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative is located in Yudong Township, Yugou District, which is a well-known disaster-prone area in Huaiyin Special District. Historically, it has suffered major disasters in heavy rains and minor disasters in light rains. This year's disaster is particularly severe, with crops suffering continuously during the wheat season, mid-season, and late autumn seasons. According to local old farmers, this is the most severe disaster in nearly fifty years.
    The severe disaster dealt a great blow to the production morale of the members. A small number of members were pessimistic and disappointed. Two people left their hometown for Jiangnan after the typhoon, some members requested to withdraw from the cooperative, and some members were not very settled in their production.
    However, those who were frightened by the disaster were, after all, in the minority. Most farmers recognized the superiority of agricultural cooperatives in overcoming natural disasters. They generally said, "If there were no agricultural cooperatives, we would have long since fled to who knows where in the face of such a famine." Tao Yuquan, a member in his fifties, personally experienced the flood fifty years ago, when seven out of his family of eight died. Now, both people and livestock are safe and sound, and food can be supplied even when there is a shortage. His mood is very stable now. Wu Youyin, deputy secretary of the Yudong Township Party General Branch, told us that in the past, when this township suffered disasters, the government had to lend several thousand yuan in disaster relief funds every year. This year, the government only lent forty yuan. The whole township relies on the Qianjin Cooperative to lead the masses in carrying out production for self-relief. Even if the government no longer provides relief in the future, they can still overcome natural disasters through self-reliance.
    In order to lead all the members to overcome the disaster, the cooperative convened meetings of old farmers to seek specific ways to make up for the losses caused by the disaster, and absorbed many experience in surviving famine from the masses. On September 8th, the cooperative convened a cooperative affairs committee, which made a comprehensive analysis of the disaster situation and conducted specific research on the favorable conditions for overcoming the famine: First, in the wheat season, each work day received four and a half catties of wheat, and three catties of grain were distributed again during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Coupled with the income from some late autumn crops and sideline and economic crops, it is estimated that each work day can still receive more than one yuan for the whole year. Second, the cooperative has 4,132 mu of cotton. If we continue to strengthen the management of late-stage cotton fields and strive to increase one cotton boll per plant and harvest one more catty of ginned cotton per mu, the cooperative can harvest more than 4,000 catties of ginned cotton. Third, the wheat stubble sweet potatoes that are growing better need to be turned over and weeded in a timely manner, and the wheat stubble sweet potatoes that are growing poorly should be topdressed with fertilizer again. Calculated on the basis of increasing one or two taels of sweet potatoes per hole, the cooperative can increase 400,000 catties of sweet potatoes, and each household can receive an average of 300 catties more sweet potatoes.
    These three calculations greatly enhanced the cooperative cadres' confidence in production and self-relief.
    The cooperative committee also decided to increase the planting of radishes, vegetables, broad beans, and other crops. In addition to the cooperative's original 740 mu of land, another 400 mu of land will be allocated to members as vegetable plots. Each mu can harvest at least 400 catties of fresh vegetables, and the vegetables produced on more than 1,000 mu of land can offset 80,000 catties of grain. The 2,000 chicks raised collectively by the cooperative will be sold to individual members for raising. Coupled with the 76 piglets that have already been sold to members, this can solve the problem of insufficient sideline funds for some poor members.
    In order to encourage the masses to accumulate fertilizer, the cooperative committee decided to allocate 1,200 yuan in cash from sideline income to purchase fertilizer from members. And further settle the fertilizer investment, paying cash to those who invested more.
    After accounting, the total output value of agricultural and sideline production income of the whole cooperative can increase by about 21% compared with the bumper year of 1955.
    What about some members whose income may decrease or remain unchanged? To this end, the cooperative also took various measures. For 72 households with more land and less labor, they were assigned to do field management work for cotton and sweet potatoes; for 11 households with less labor but a solid economic foundation, they were helped to develop household sideline occupations; for 20 households who lost labor due to illness, in addition to helping them to arrange family labor rationally, they were also helped to treat their illnesses as much as possible so that they could participate in production as soon as possible; arrangements were also made for 26 "five-guarantee households". In this way, among the 1,208 households in the entire cooperative, the number of farmers whose income increased compared with last year reached 92%, the income of the remaining 5% of members remained unchanged, and only 3% of members' income may decrease.
    After doing the accounting, most of the members have the confidence to overcome natural disasters. In particular, the three measures of expanding private vegetable plots, purchasing fertilizer with cash, and helping members develop household sideline occupations were particularly supported by the masses. The general reaction was: "The big cooperative is too good to us, we won't leave the cooperative even if struck by lightning or fire."
    By September 10th, all the members had plunged into activities to overcome the famine. Within two days, the entire cooperative had pruned, topped, and sprayed phosphorus on 1,126 mu of cotton fields, and applied topdressing fertilizer to 412 mu of wheat stubble sweet potato fields. The masses' enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer was high. Half of the members of the tenth team were digging manure pits and dredging sewers. Many people carried manure baskets on their backs when going to the fields, meetings, and schools, and collected manure early and late. Once, we met Zhang Zhaonan, a 74-year-old man, on the road. He excitedly said to me: "At my age, the cooperative originally didn't have any work suitable for me. Now, with cash buying goods, the cooperative asked us to accumulate fertilizer, and I can earn five work points a day."
    Within two days, seven of the eleven production teams in the cooperative had demarcated private plots, and 137 households had planted vegetables on their private plots. Members who could not afford to raise chickens in the past also raised chickens.
    In this agricultural cooperative in the heavily affected area, a new atmosphere of vigorous production for self-relief can be seen everywhere.

    在五十年来未有的灾害面前
    ——前进社力争90％的社员增加收入
                本报记者　甄为民
    九月四日，江苏省淮阴专区遭到十级台风的袭击，形成全专区性的涝灾。重灾区的农业社究竟有没有力量战胜自然灾害，这是人们最关心的一个问题。为了具体了解这一个问题，我访问了淮阴专区的重灾区——淮阴县的前进农业社。
    前进农业社所在地是渔沟区的渔东乡，这个区是淮阴专区著名的老灾区，历来是大雨大灾，小雨小灾。今年的灾情尤其严重，麦季、午季、晚秋三季农作物连续受灾。据当地老农说：这是近五十年来最严重的一次灾害。
    严重的灾害给了社员生产情绪很大的打击，一小部分社员悲观失望，有两个人在台风过后就离乡到江南去了，有的社员提出了退社的要求，有些社员在生产上也不大安心了。
    但是，被灾害吓倒的，毕竟是少数人。大多数农民都认识到了农业社在战胜灾害方面所表现的优越性。他们普遍的说法是：“要是没有农业社，碰到这样的荒年，我们早就不知逃荒到哪里去了。”五十多岁的社员陶玉泉亲身经历过五十年前那次水灾，全家八口人死了七口；而现在是人牛太平，缺粮也可以得到供应，现在情绪十分安定。渔东乡党总支副书记吴友银告诉我们：这个乡过去受灾，政府每年都要贷放救灾款几千元。今年政府只贷放了四十元，全乡依靠前进社带动群众，开展生产自救，即使今后政府不再救济，也可以自力更生地战胜自然灾害。
    为了领导全体社员战胜灾害，合作社里召开了老农会议，寻求弥补受灾损失的具体办法，从群众中吸取到许多度荒经验。九月八日，合作社又召开了社务委员会，对灾情作了全面的分析，对战胜灾荒的有利条件作了具体研究：一、麦季，每个劳动日分到四斤半麦子，中秋又分到三斤粮食，加上部分晚秋作物和副业、经济作物的收入，估计全年每个劳动日仍能分到一元多。二、全社有四千一百三十二亩棉花，如果继续加强晚期棉田管理，争取每株棉花增加一个棉桃、每亩多收一斤皮棉，全社就可以多收四千多斤皮棉。三、生长较好的麦茬甘薯，需要适时翻藤、除草，生长较差的麦茬甘薯，再普遍追施一次肥。按每穴甘薯增加一两计算，全社就可以增加四十万斤甘薯，平均每户又可以多分到三百斤甘薯。
    这三笔账把社干部的生产自救的信心大大增强了。
    社委会还决定增种罗卜、蔬菜、蚕豆等作物。除社里原有七百四十亩地外，再拿出四百亩地分给社员作菜地，每亩至少可收鲜菜四百斤，一千多亩地所产的菜，可抵粮食八万斤。把集体养的二千只小鸡分别赊给社员个人饲养；加上已经赊给社员的七十六头小猪，就可以解决部分贫困社员的副业资金不足的困难。
    为了鼓励群众积肥，社委会决定从副业收入中拨出一千二百元现款，用来收购社员的肥料。并进一步结清肥料投资，投资多的付给现钱。
    经过会计结算，全社农副业生产收入的总产值，比丰收的1955年还可以增产21％左右。
    有一些可能减少收入和不增不减的社员怎么办？对此，合作社也采取了各种措施。对七十二户土地多、劳力少的社员，分配他们做棉花、甘薯的田间管理工作；对十一户劳力少但经济底子厚的社员，帮助他们发展家庭副业；对因为疾病而丧失劳力的二十户社员，除帮助他们合理安排家庭劳力外，并尽量帮助他们治病，使他们能早日参加生产；对二十六户“五保户”也都做了安排。这样，全社一千二百零八户社员中，比去年增加收入的农户即达到92％，其余5％的社员不增不减，只有3％的社员可能减少收入。
    经过算账以后，绝大部分社员都具有了战胜自然灾害的信心，特别是扩大自留菜地、现金收购肥料，帮助社员发展家庭副业等三项措施，特别受到群众的拥护，普遍的反映是：“大社对我们太好了，雷打火烧也不离社”。
    到九月十日，全体社员纷纷投入了战胜灾荒的活动。两天内，全社已有一千一百二十六亩棉田进行了整枝、摘心和喷磷，四百一十二亩麦茬甘薯田施了追肥，群众积肥的情绪很高。十队有一半社员挖粪坑、掏阴沟，很多人下田、开会、上学都背着粪筐，起早带晚拾粪。有一次我们在路上碰到七十四岁的老汉张兆南，他兴奋地对我说：“我这样大的年纪，社里本来没有适合我做的活，现在现钱买现货，社里叫我们积肥，一天能挣到五个工分。”
    两天内全社十一个生产队已有七个队划好了自留地，有一百三十七户在自留地上种上了菜。过去养不起小鸡的社员，也养了小鸡。
    在这个重灾区的农业社，到处可以看到一片生气蓬勃的生产自救的新气象。
