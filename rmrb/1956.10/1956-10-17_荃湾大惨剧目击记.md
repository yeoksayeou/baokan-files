Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th: A Hong Kong dispatch: "The New Evening News" published a "Witness Account of the Tsuen Wan Massacre" on the 15th, reporting the heinous crimes committed by Kuomintang secret agents and bandits in the Tsuen Wan area.

The report stated: According to a resident who escaped from Tsuen Wan yesterday, he personally witnessed Kuomintang secret agents collectively massacring workers in Tsuen Wan using the most brutal methods. He saw fifty-eight bodies on the road.

This Tsuen Wan resident spent three days in the hellish Tsuen Wan. He witnessed the Kuomintang's atrocities, apart from those committed inside the factories. He said that this riot in Tsuen Wan was initiated by Kuomintang elements, and the action was organized and planned. They committed arson and murder, stopping at nothing.

He said that on the morning of the 11th, he met a Tsuen Wan triad member who said that they would launch an uprising in Tsuen Wan. He also revealed that more than one hundred Kuomintang secret agents arrived in Tsuen Wan from Tiu Keng Leng and other places at 10 a.m., and met with local "Free Laborers," "14K gang" members, and triad members, holding a meeting at 12 noon. At 4 p.m. that day, they first launched an attack on the Po Shing Cotton Mill.

Before the rioters acted, they all had special markings. Kuomintang secret agents and "Free Laborers" each wore a Kuomintang badge on their chests; "14K gang" members each wore a white towel around their left hand; as for the triad members, they each wore a white towel around their necks for identification. However, the actions of these triad members were at the command of the Kuomintang secret agents. Some of the thugs were commanded, some held Kuomintang flags, and those in command each had a police whistle, and everyone obeyed the whistle's signals.

He said: On the afternoon of the 11th, Kuomintang secret agents first made trouble at the Po Shing Cotton Mill. He saw a corpse by the roadside.

At 6:15 p.m., he passed the Workers' Union clinic and the Textile Dyeing Cooperative in Muk Yuen Ha. At this time, it was being besieged. He saw hundreds of people gathered, holding weapons such as wooden sticks, triangular awls, iron pens, and half-pair of scissors, brutally beating several people. Later, after they dispersed, he saw a woman lying naked on the ground, barely alive, and seven other male corpses.

At this moment, around 6:30 p.m., the rioters surged to the gate of the Agricultural Workers' Union on Castle Peak Road to attack. Then, the rioters attacked the Silk Weavers' Union and a United Barber Shop. By 7 p.m., the Agricultural Workers' Union was breached, and some people were abducted and beaten, but the exact numbers were not clear.

At that time, the Silk Weavers' Union was under prolonged attack, but the rioters could not break through. They clamored and made noise, attempting to attack from the rooftop several times, but were blocked by barbed wire. Until about 9 p.m., the rioters cut the barbed wire and opened a large hole in the rooftop, throwing cotton balls soaked in kerosene into the hole and setting them on fire. At this time, the rioters besieged the Silk Weavers' Union for nearly three hours, and thousands of people surrounded the front of the building. After the Silk Weavers' Union was breached, eight workers from the Silk Weavers' Union were dragged out by the rioters, who also moved the furniture inside outside and set it on fire. These eight workers were subjected to torture by these rioters, first beating them unconscious, then throwing them into the fire; when they woke up, they were beaten again, and burned again, killing these eight workers alive in this way, the tragedy was unbearable to witness.

At 10 p.m., the rioters turned to attack the Enamel Workers' Union and another branch of the Silk Weavers' Union on Hoi Pa Street, where it was heard that three more people were beaten to death.

At this time, the entire Tsuen Wan was like a city of demons. At 11 p.m., the rioters knocked on doors in the Tsuen Wan urban area, forcing residents to hang Kuomintang flags.

At the same time, Tiancheng Cotton Wool Factory, a shop on Tsuen Wan Old Street, was also stormed by rioters, who set fire to the cotton wool in the store. In front of the store, a female worker was grabbed by the rioters, who stripped her clothes off and ordered her to kneel before a Kuomintang flag. An employee of Tiancheng Cotton Wool Factory, upon seeing this, simply said, "Too cruel," and the rioters immediately expressed their dissatisfaction and attacked the Tiancheng Cotton Wool Factory.

Around 10 p.m., the rioters took more than thirty people to the front of the Red Lotus Bakery on Castle Peak Road and beat them, with iron pens and wooden sticks flying, and scissors and triangular awls stabbing straight. At this time, a man in his thirties came out to dissuade the rioters from being so cruel, but before he could finish his words, he was suddenly struck on the head with a wooden stick and fell to the ground, followed by a large rock hitting his head, and the man died inexplicably.

Around 12 o'clock, twenty or thirty people from the Enamel Workers' Union were abducted and paraded naked, dragged to kneel before the flag in front of Kwong Yuen Shing grocery store on Chung On Street.

This riot did not stop until 2 a.m. that night, and the rioters then turned to attack various factories. According to the resident who witnessed this tragedy, he personally saw thirty-seven bodies in front of the Red Lotus Bakery, two bodies in front of the Tung Yick Pawnshop, eight bodies in front of the Workers' Clinic, eight bodies in front of the Silk Weavers' Union, and three bodies in the alley next to the Fire Brigade, a total of fifty-eight bodies. As for what he did not see but heard from friends and relatives, thirty-seven people were beaten to death at the Po Shing Cotton Mill, two people were beaten to death in front of Po Shing, three people were beaten to death at the Hoi Pa Street Silk Weavers' Union, and more than ten people were beaten to death at each of the Hong Feng Cotton Mill and the Sun Wah Cotton Mill.

    荃湾大惨剧目击记
    新华社广州16日电　香港消息：“新晚报”15日发表了一篇“荃湾大惨剧目击记”，报道国民党特务匪徒在荃湾地区所犯的滔天罪行。
    这篇报道写道：根据昨天一位自荃湾逃出的居民说，他亲眼看到国民党特务分子用最残酷办法集体屠杀荃湾的工人，他在路上所看到的尸体有五十八具。
    这一位荃湾居民在像地狱一样的荃湾度过了三天，国民党的暴行，除了在工厂内进行的外，他都在场目睹。他说，这次荃湾的暴行，是国民党分子所发动的，而且行动是有组织、有计划的，他们放火杀人，无所不为。
    他说，他在11日上午，便碰到一个荃湾的黑社会分子说，他们将在荃湾举事。他还透露，有一百多个国民党特务分子在上午十时自吊颈岭和别的地方赶到了荃湾，和当地的“自由劳工”、“十四K党”和黑社会分子会合，于正午十二时举行会议。当日下午四时，便首先向宝星纱厂发动了攻击。
    这次暴徒在行事前，都有特别的记号，国民党特务分子和“自由劳工”每人的胸前佩了一个国民党的标帜；“十四K党”分子每人左手缠了白手巾，至于黑社会组织的人马，则每人将白手巾围在颈上，以诸识别。不过，这般黑社会分子的行动，是听命于国民党特务分子的，打手们有人指挥，持着国民党旗帜的也有人指挥，指挥的人每人有一个警笛，所有的人都听命于警笛行事。
    他说：11日下午，国民党特务分子首先在宝星纱厂捣乱。他看到路旁有具尸体。
    六时十五分，他途经木园下的工联会医疗所和纺织染合作社。此时正被围攻，只见集聚了几百人，分持木棍、三角锉、铁笔、半边剪刀等凶器，将几个人恶殴。后来他们散去后，便看到有一个女子赤身露体，奄奄一息的倒在地上，另外还有七个男尸。
    就在这时，大约六时三十分左右，暴徒又涌到了青山道种植工会门前进攻。接着，暴徒又袭击丝织工会及一家联合理发室。至七时，种植工会被攻入，有人被掳及被殴，但详细数目看不清楚。
    其时，丝织工会被久攻不入，暴徒鼓噪喧啸，几次拟由天台进攻，但为铁丝网所阻，直至九时左右，暴徒将铁丝网剪去，在天台上打开了一个大洞，由洞内抛入蘸有火油的棉纱球，举火燃烧。此时，暴徒围攻丝织工会前后几达三小时，而且门前围有千数百人。丝织工会被攻破后，丝织工会有八个工人被暴徒拖出门外，同时还将里面的家具搬出门外纵火燃烧。这八个工人被这般暴徒用火烙之刑先将他们打昏，然后放进火里去烧；烧醒了又打，打了又烧，如是将这八个工人活活打死，其惨状令人目不忍睹。
    到了十时，暴徒又转到搪瓷工会和海坝街丝织工会另一会所进袭，闻又有三人被打死。
    这时，整个荃湾有如魔城。到了十一时，暴徒在荃湾的市区逐家拍门，迫悬国民党旗。
    同时，荃湾旧街的一家天成棉胎厂，也被暴徒攻入，将店内的棉胎举火燃烧。在该店门前，还有一女工被暴徒抓住，将她的衣服剥光，命令她跪在一只国民党旗之前，天成棉胎厂一个职员见状，只口说一声：“太过残忍”，暴徒即表示不满，立即到天成棉胎厂行凶。
    暴徒于十时左右，曾将三十多人带到青山道红莲面包公司的门前殴打，铁笔木棍横飞，剪刀三角锉直刺。这时候，有一个年约三十多岁的男子，出来劝阻这些暴徒，不要如此残忍，哪知他的话还未说完，头上突遭一木棍，当场昏倒，接着又有一块大石块向他的头部击去，这男子就不明不白地牺牲了。
    十二时左右，搪瓷工会中有二三十人被掳去赤身游行，拖到中安街广源盛杂货店前跪旗。
    这一次暴乱，直到深夜二时，才暂停下，暴徒们遂转向各工厂袭击。据目击这惨案发生的这位居民说，他亲眼看到的，红莲面包公司
  门前陈尸三十七具，同益当铺门前
  陈尸二具，工人医疗所前陈尸八具，丝织工会门前陈尸八具，消防队横巷陈尸三具，一共是五十八具。至
  于他未看到而从亲友听到的，宝星纱厂有三十七人被殴毙，宝星门前有两人被殴毙；海坝街丝织工会有三人被殴毙；鸿丰纱厂和新华纱厂，每厂有十多人被殴毙。
