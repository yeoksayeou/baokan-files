Commentary on the British Conservative Party Annual Conference
By Xia Biro, Reporter for "World News," Organ of the British Communist Party

When Eden delivered his speech at the Conservative Party Annual Conference in Llandudno last week, his slight fever had subsided.

But everything he said at the conference did not alleviate the fever the Conservative Party was suffering from regarding the crisis of the British Empire.

This stood in stark contrast to the conclusion of the Labour Party Annual Conference in Blackpool, which ended with a level of confidence unseen in eleven years. The Labour Party Annual Conference demonstrated a leftward trend in the workers' movement by electing Bevan as treasurer, rejecting wage restrictions, and insisting on peaceful solutions to the Suez problem. The conference showed that ordinary Labour Party members strongly demanded unity and high combativeness, as the Conservative Party tried desperately to get Britain out of the crisis by sacrificing the interests of the people.

At the Conservative Party Annual Conference, there were signs of disagreement among ordinary Conservative Party members. The meeting was filled with an anxious, almost dejected atmosphere. Usually, serious political commentators pay little attention to Conservative Party annual conferences. It is more of a circus than a meeting, a platform for the "great leaders" to issue exaggerated slogans and engage in cheap propaganda in Conservative Party and other newspapers. Because in this party of big entrepreneurs, which Eden calls a democracy that "owns property," there is plenty of huge property but very little democracy.

As usual, they would drag out a docile Conservative Party trade union worker, and then have a Conservative Party housewife come out to prove that the Conservative Party is connected to ordinary people.

This year's conference was not without clichés and various tricks. The conference shouted the cleverly worded slogan "The right wing has a bright future" (in English, the term "right wing" is literally the same as "correct path," here the Conservative Party is playing on words – translator's note). They talked about the "loyal friendship" of Western Europe, as if such a thing really existed among cutthroat competitors; they flaunted emotions to member countries on the issue of the British Commonwealth, while their big business bosses were calculating whether it would be beneficial to abandon the British Imperial Preference system.

"Remember, the British Commonwealth is not the British Empire." Eden took this wonderful statement from the right wing of the Labour Party and claimed it as his own. This is far from the heyday of the Conservative Party in the 1920s, when a Conservative Party leader openly said: "What we have gained by the sword, we will also keep by the sword." As Churchill once brazenly said to a U.S. senator, "Whether it is the British Empire or the British Commonwealth, we hold various trademarks to suit all different tastes."

However, this year, it is difficult for the usual sugary hypocrisy of the upper class to cover up the ruthless reality.

Suez is an explosive event that clearly provided the annual conference with a vivid depiction of the glory of the empire having passed.

On Saturday, just as Eden was telling his "loyal followers" that "Britain will never give in," his foreign minister was painfully reaching an agreement in New York with the foreign ministers of France and Egypt, agreeing to six principles as the basis for negotiating a solution to the Suez crisis. In the words of the Associated Press, these principles meant that "the Anglo-French insistence on international control of the Suez Canal has been weakened almost to the point of disappearing."

It is said that in the corridors of the Llandudno conference, the ghost of Disraeli could be heard weeping. Because the paralyzed hands of the great Conservative Party can no longer firmly grasp its huge catch, and the Conservative Party is precisely the party of financial oligarchs that Disraeli re-established at the beginning of imperialism.

The Suez issue symbolizes the rise and fall of the British Empire.

Eighty-one years ago, the British Conservative Party government, at the initiative of Prime Minister Disraeli and with the support of bankers, cheaply bought the Suez Canal shares held by the Governor of Egypt. Thanks to this financial trick, British bankers not only controlled Egypt but also controlled another large piece of land in Africa. This revealed the close connection between the Conservative Party and the powerful international financial oligarchs.

Last week, "stupid" Eden, caught between the rising tide of colonial independence movements and the pressure from the new-style colonialist country, the United States, Britain's "great benefactor," had to give up what "wise" Disraeli had seized.

No wonder the Conservatives meeting in Llandudno had a headache. The Suez Canal issue illustrates the predicament of those who want to rely on U.S. support to maintain the interests of the British Empire.

Conservatives are beginning to show Dulles the same anger they feel towards Nasser. In the days leading up to the annual conference, Conservative MP Ted Leather, one of the founders of "Friends of the Atlantic Alliance" and an active supporter of the Anglo-American alliance and NATO, commented: "For a period of time to come, NATO may continue to be the basis of Western countries' foreign policy, but Mr. Dulles' perfidy has made it an empty shell."

The Suez Canal issue has also caused the first real rupture in the "traditional" bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy between the leaders of the Conservative and Labour parties. After being subjected to massive demonstrations, trade union resolutions, and strong pressure from the grassroots who support the Labour Party, Gaitskell changed his initial hostile stance towards Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company and adopted a position opposed to the Conservative Party.

The Suez issue specifically reflects the predicament of British Conservatism.

Unsurprisingly, anxiety has also emerged in the Conservative Party's economic policies. Six million organized workers are demanding wage increases. At the Trade Union Congress held last month, both the left and right wings unanimously opposed the government's demand to "restrict wages." Recently, prices have continued to rise, and the price of each loaf of bread has risen from eight and a half pence to eleven pence. The Conservative Party Chancellor of the Exchequer's "tighten your belts, tighten credit" approach has led to reduced working hours and unemployment, especially in the automobile industry.

These economic problems were not fully reflected in the Conservative Party Annual Conference. Although the "take a tough stance against workers" faction was very loud, many of them were the same group of people who were for "take a tough stance against Nasser"; however, some speeches and resolutions still revealed anxiety that the rising cost of living would affect the middle class and the Conservative Party's professional supporters.

Despite generations of cunning experience, the British rulers can find no comfort wherever they turn their eyes. The only comfort Eden could give his followers was: "By the end of this year, the British overseas oil industry will greatly exceed that of 1955." Just as American oil merchants are actively squeezing Britain out of the Middle East, isn't this a big bone worth gnawing on?

During the three days of this annual conference, the Kowloon riots revealed the confusion of British policy, which attempts to gain something from condoning and harboring Kuomintang secret agents. There is an ancient Greek saying: "Whom God wishes to destroy, he first makes mad." This British policy only opens the door for the United States, Britain's biggest trade competitor. The situation is the same in Iran, Malaya, the Middle East, and now in Africa.

Hoping to avoid taking the only logical and active approach to get out of the predicament, the Conservative Party is proposing plans to establish a closer economic alliance with other Western European countries, even if it would jeopardize the traditional (imperial) preferential system.

When Eden said "we Western Europe" at the annual conference, it was a great irony, because Britain has until now avoided the Western European alliance as much as possible. It is said that once, the English Channel was foggy, separating Britain from the European continent, and the headline of a Conservative Party newspaper read: "Channel Fog, Continent Isolated," which became a big joke in Europe.

In analyzing the anxiety reflected in this Conservative Party Annual Conference, it would be futile to look for any progressive and healthy signs that could solve Britain's problems. Only one person had the courage to openly oppose Eden's policies and point out that serious unrest had emerged in the British reserve army in Cyprus; but he was shouted down as a "communist." This vehement situation fully demonstrated the die-hard nature of the Conservatives.

The British Conservative Party is a party of landlords and monopoly capitalists. They control most of the propaganda machine and try their best to spread the idea that "what is good for big business is definitely good for the people." They have indeed gained power through elections. But this is due less to the promises they made to the people than to the disunity in the ranks of the workers' movement and the great disappointment the people felt towards the right-wing Labour government during the period of 1945-1951. At that time, Bevin launched the Cold War and opened the door for American infiltration.

More than half of the Conservatives sitting in the front row in the House of Commons graduated from the two most lavish private schools (namely Harrow School, which Churchill attended, and Eton School, which Eden attended), and the others also came from equally lavish places.

The mass movement prevented the government from ultimately committing the foolish act of launching a war against Egypt. The Communist Party played a big role in this movement. The ever-increasing pressure from the working class will break down the barriers erected by class interests and prejudices, develop trade between East and West, use capitalists' profits to improve the people's living standards, and break the dollar chain and eliminate the threat of war.

The irresponsible attitude shown by the British authorities in the Suez Canal issue and the Kowloon riots has shown that British Conservatives lack a sense of reality. Pollitt warned the British government a few days ago: "Don't play with fire."

The Labour Party Annual Conference and the Trade Union Congress Annual Conference demonstrated the growing unity of the workers' movement. Only this unity can guide Britain out of its difficult situation. Railway workers' leader Jim Campbell expressed a healthy confidence, saying: "The Conservative Party is crumbling, and the Labour Party in Parliament should come out to overthrow the Conservative Party." Even right-wing figures like Labour Party Secretary Morgan Phillips said: "The workers' movement is not only prepared to take on national responsibility, but also determined to obtain this responsibility and maintain it."

    评英国保守党年会
    英国共产党机关刊物“世界新闻”记者　夏庇若
    艾登上星期向兰达诺保守党年会发表演说的时候，他的轻微的热病痊愈了。
    但是，他在会上所讲的一切并不能减轻在英帝国危机问题上保守党所患的热病。
    这同布莱克浦工党年会以十一年来从未出现过的高度信心结束的情况，形成了鲜明的对照。工党年会选举比万为司库，否决对工资的限制，并且坚持以和平方法解决苏伊士问题，表现出工人运动向左转的趋势。会议显示出，在保守党竭力想依靠牺牲人民利益使英国摆脱危机的情况下工党普通党员强烈地要求团结和他们高度的战斗性。
    在保守党年会上，出现了保守党普通党员意见不一致的迹象。会议充满焦虑的、几乎是一种沮丧的气氛。通常，严肃的政治评论家是很少注意保守党年会的。它是一个马戏班子而不是一个会议，是“伟大的领袖们”发布夸张的口号和在保守党和其他报刊上进行廉价宣传的讲台。因为在这个被艾登称为主张“拥有财产的民主”的大企业家的政党里，有的是巨额的财产，却很少民主。
    照例，他们会把一个温驯的保守党工会工作人员牵出来，然后由一个保守党的家庭主妇出来证明，保守党是和普通人民有联系的。
    今年的会上也少不了陈腔滥调和各种把戏。会上喊出了“右倾势力前途远大”（在英文里“右倾势力”一词与“正确的通路”字面相同，这里是保守党在卖弄文字——译注）这个措词巧妙的口号。他们谈论着西欧的“忠诚的友谊”，好像在你死我活的竞争者中间真正存在着这样的东西；他们在英联邦问题上向成员国卖弄情感，而同时他们的大企业老板却在盘算着放弃英帝国特惠制是否有利。
    “记住，大英联邦不是大英帝国。”艾登接收了工党右翼的这一美妙的说法，并把它据为己有。现在远不是二十年代保守党全盛时期了，当时，保守党的一个领导人公开地说：“我们用刀剑得来的东西，也要用刀剑保有它。”正像丘吉尔有一次公然无耻地对美国一位参议员所说的，“英帝国也好，英联邦也好，我们持有各种商标以适应各种不同的口味。”
    可是，今年上层社会的惯常的甜言蜜语的伪善，要想掩住无情的现实，是很困难的。
    苏伊士是个具有爆炸性的事件，这一事件很清楚地给年会提供了一幅帝国的光荣已经过去的鲜明写照。
    星期六，正当艾登告诉他的“忠心耿耿的徒众”说“英国决不让步”的时候，他的外交大臣却在纽约忍痛地同法国、埃及的外交部长达成协议，同意以六项原则作为谈判解决苏伊士危机的基础。用合众社的话来说，这些原则意味着“英法坚持国际管制苏伊士运河的态度几乎削弱到了消失不见的地步。”
    据说，在兰达诺会议的走廊里，听得见狄斯累利的鬼魂在哭泣。因为，伟大的保守党的瘫痪的双手已不能再抓牢它巨大的捕获品了，而保守党正是狄斯累利在帝国主义开始时期重新建立的财政寡头政党。
    苏伊士问题象征着英帝国的兴衰。
    八十一年前，英国保守党政府在首相狄斯累利的倡议和银行家的支持下，很便宜地收买了埃及总督所持有的苏伊士运河的股票。由于这个财政上的妙计，英国的银行家们不但控制了埃及而且也控制了非洲的另外一大片土地。这件事暴露了保守党和强有力的国际财政寡头之间的紧密联系。
    上星期，“愚蠢的”艾登在高涨的殖民地独立运动和英国的“伟大恩人”新式殖民主义国家美国的压力的夹攻下，已不得不放弃“英明的”狄斯累利所攫取的东西。
    怪不得，在兰达诺开会的保守党人感到头痛。苏伊士运河问题说明，想依靠美国的支持来维护英帝国利益的人，陷入了窘境。
    保守党人开始对杜勒斯表现出他们对纳赛尔同样的愤怒。在年会召开的前几天，“大西洋同盟之友”的创办人之一、英美联盟和北大西洋公约组织的积极支持者、保守党议员台德·莱特尔发出了这样的评语：“在今后的一个时期内，北大西洋公约组织还可以继续成为西方国家外交政策的基础，但是，杜勒斯先生的背信弃义已使它成为一个空架子了。”
    苏伊士运河问题也对保守党和工党的领袖们长期以来在外交政策上“传统的”两党合作关系，造成了第一次真正的破裂。盖次克尔在遭受到大规模的游行示威，工会决议和来自支持工党的基层群众的抗议的人民的强大压力之后，改变了他起先对埃及收回苏伊士运河公司所采取的敌对立场，转而采取同保守党相对立的立场。
    苏伊士问题具体地反映了英国保守主义所处的窘境。
    在经济政策上，保守党也出现了焦虑，这是不足为奇的。六百万有组织的工人正在要求增加工资。在上月召开的职工大会上，左右两翼都一致反对政府提出的“限制工资”的要求。最近物价继续上涨，每个面包的价格已由八个半便士涨到十一便士。保守党财政大臣的“束紧腰带，紧缩信用”的办法造成工作时间的缩短和失业，特别是在汽车工业部门。
    这些经济问题在保守党年会中并未充分地表现出来。虽然“对工人采取强硬手段”派叫的很响，他们之中的许多人正是“对纳赛尔采取强硬手段”派的那一群人；但是，在某些讲演和决议中还是流露出对于生活费用上涨会影响到中产阶级和保守党的职业支持者的焦虑。
    英国统治者尽管有着多少代的老奸巨猾的经验，但是无论他们把眼睛转到那里，都找不到安慰。艾登能够给他的追随者的唯一的安慰是：“到今年年底，英国海外石油工业的生意将大大地超过1955年。”正当美国石油商积极在中东排挤英国的时候，这可不是一块值得咀嚼的大骨头么。
    就在这个年会举行的三天中，九龙暴乱事件暴露出企图从纵容和包庇国民党特务中得到一些东西的英国政策的错乱。希腊有一句古话说：“上帝想毁灭谁，就首先使谁发疯”。英国这种政策不过是为英国最大的贸易劲敌美国打开方便之门。在伊朗，在马来亚，在中东，如今在非洲，情形都是这样。
    保守党希望不采取唯一的合乎逻辑的、积极的方法走出困境，他们正在提出要同其他西欧国家建立更为密切的经济联盟的计划，即使这样做会危害传统的（帝国的）特惠制也在所不惜。
    当艾登在年会上说“我们西欧”这个词儿的时候，这是莫大的讽刺，因为英国直到现在还尽可能远远地避开西欧联盟。据说，有一次，英伦海峡大雾，把英国同欧洲大陆隔开了，一家保守党报纸的标题写道：“海峡大雾，大陆被孤立了”，结果成为欧洲的大笑话。
    人们在分析这次保守党年会所反映出来的焦虑时，如果想寻觅任何能为英国解决问题的进步和健康的迹象，则将是徒劳的。只有一个人曾鼓起勇气公开反对艾登的政策，并且指出在塞浦路斯的英国后备军中已出现了严重的不安；但他被当作“共产党”大声呵斥下去了。这种声色俱厉的情形，充分显示了保守党人的死硬。
    英国保守党是个地主和垄断资本家的政党。他们掌握着大部分的宣传机器，千方百计地散播这样一种观念：“对于大企业有好处的事，一定也对人民有好处”。他们也的确通过选举而得到了政权。但这与其说是由于他们对人民许下的诺言，倒不如说主要是由于工人运动的队伍里的不团结和1945—1951年期间右翼工党政府使人民大失所望的原故。当时，贝文展开了冷战，并为美国渗入开了大门。
    在下院里坐在前排的保守党人一半以上都毕业于两个最阔气的私立学校（即丘吉尔曾读过的哈罗学校和艾登曾读过的伊顿学校），其他的人也都来自同样阔气的地方。
    群众运动阻止了政府最后向埃及开战的愚蠢行为。在这个运动中，共产党起了很大作用。不断高涨的工人阶级压力，将冲毁因阶级利益和偏见而树起来的壁垒，使东西方贸易得到发展，用资本家的利润来提高人民的生活水平，并击破美元锁链和消除战争威胁。
    英国当局在苏伊士运河问题上和九龙暴乱事件中所表现的不负责任态度，已说明英国保守党人缺乏现实感。波立特在几天以前曾警告英国政府：“不要玩火”。
    工党年会和职工大会年会表现了工人运动不断增长的团结。只有这种团结可以将英国从困难处境中引导出来。铁路工人领袖杰姆·坎贝尔表达出一种健康的信心说：“保守党正在摇摇欲坠，国会里的工党应该出来推翻保守党。”甚至于右翼人士如工党书记摩根·菲利普斯也说：“工人运动不仅已准备担负国家责任，而且决定要取得这个责任并保持它。”
