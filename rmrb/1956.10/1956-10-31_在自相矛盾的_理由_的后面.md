    Behind the Self-Contradictory "Reasons"
    Fan Ren
    
    There is the following passage in the "Publisher's Note" to the "Investiture of the Gods" published by the Writers Publishing House: "This book is relatively easy to understand, only occasionally quoting texts from the Book of Documents, etc., which are slightly archaic, but not very much, so no annotations have been added." In the "Publisher's Note" to the "Romance of the Eastern Zhou Dynasties," also published by the Writers Publishing House, there is the following passage: "This book has not been annotated because there are extremely many classical Chinese components in the book. If annotations were added, it would be lengthy and repetitive, almost a transcription of general dictionaries and lexicons. If the historical facts written therein were to have their sources noted one by one, it would become a complete transcription of books such as the Zuo Zhuan and the Strategies of the Warring States, which is also unnecessary for the average reader."
    
    Neither of these two books has annotations; the former because the need for annotations is "not very much," and the latter because the need for annotations is "extremely much."
    
    Someone asked: Aren't these two passages somewhat contradictory? Yes, unfortunately, similar things are not uncommon in our real life.
    
    For example, if a problem is submitted to the relevant departments for resolution, if it is only a matter for a few people, one often encounters the following answer: "This is an individual problem, the situation is relatively special, let's put it aside for the time being!" If this is a matter for most people, one often encounters the following answer: "This is a common problem, resolving it involves many aspects, let's put it aside for the time being!" As a result, neither is resolved.
    
    Or, for example, if a problem is submitted to the relevant departments for resolution. If the problem is not very urgent, one often encounters the following answer: "It doesn't matter if things are delayed a bit, let's talk about it after a while!" When it is dragged to the point where it cannot be delayed any longer, and it is brought up again, one often encounters the following answer: "It's too late now, let's forget about it this time! Pay attention in advance next time." As a result, the problems are naturally not resolved.
    
    Such words often come from the mouth of the same department, the same person.
    
    However, we do not need to dwell on these contradictions, questioning them why they are self-contradictory. Because even if any one of these reasons is singled out, it is still untenable. Why can't we annotate if there is not much need for annotation? Why can't we solve a problem if it involves many aspects? Why don't we try to remedy the situation if things are urgent? ... It can be seen that these so-called "too much," "too little," "individual," "universal" and other "reasons" are simply excuses for not really wanting to solve the problem. Behind them lies the ideological consciousness of not caring about the interests of the masses and being irresponsible in work. Such "reasons" are naturally easy to be self-contradictory, and once they contradict each other, this kind of thinking is exposed more clearly.
    
    It is easy to find a "reason" to perfunctorily deal with things, truly "no shortage of excuses"! But it is not easy to truly convince people and make them accept it, because "the eyes of the masses are discerning." Therefore, to these comrades, if things can be done, do them; if things should be done but cannot be done for the time being, or if you do not want to do them, you might as well say so directly, there is absolutely no need to find some colorful and useless "reasons" to cover up this kind of thinking.

### 在自相矛盾的“理由”的后面

    在自相矛盾的“理由”的后面
    凡人
    作家出版社出版的“封神演义”的“出版说明”中有这样一段话：“本书比较浅显易解，只偶有引用尚书等文字，稍为古奥，但并不很多，所以未加注释。”也是作家出版社出版的“东周列国志”的“出版说明”中有这样一段话：“本书未加注释，是因为书中文言成分极多，如果注释起来，连篇累牍，近于一般字典、词书的钞录；其中所写历史事实，如果把它们的来源根据一一注出，又会变成全钞左传、战国策等书，对一般读者也没有什么必要。”
    这两本书都没有注释；前者是因为需要注释的“并不很多”，后者则是因为需要注释的“极多”。
    或问：这两段话不是有些矛盾吗？是的，可惜类似的事情在我们现实生活中还并不少呢。
    比如有一个问题，提请有关部门来解决，要是这只是少数人的事情，往往会遇到这样的回答：“这是一个个别问题，情况比较特殊，就暂时搁一下吧！”要是这是大多数人的事情，则往往会遇到这样的回答：“这是一个普遍问题，解决起来牵涉的方面很多，暂时还是搁一下吧！”结果，同样都不给解决。
    又比如有一个问题，提请有关部门来解决。要是这个问题并不很急，往往会遇到这样的回答：“事情拖一下也不要紧，过一个时候再说吧！”等到拖到不能再拖的时候，再提出来，又往往会遇到这样的回答：“现在已经来不及了，这一次就算了吧！下次事先注意就是了。”结果，问题自然也都没有解决。
    这样的话，常常就出于同一个部门、同一个人的口。
    但是，我们倒不必纠缠在这些矛盾之中，责问他们为什么会自相矛盾。因为就是把其中任何一条理由抽出来看，也同样是说不过去的。为什么需要注释的不多，就可以不注释了呢？为什么问题牵涉的方面多，就可以不去解决了呢？为什么事情急迫了，还不赶紧设法补救一下呢？……可见，这些所谓“太多”“太少”“个别”“普遍”等“理由”，根本只是一些不想真正把问题解决的借口。在它们的后面，藏的是不关心群众利益，工作不负责任的思想意识。这样的“理由”自然很容易自相矛盾，而一旦矛盾起来，这种思想也就暴露得更为明显了。
    找一个“理由”来搪塞一下，是很容易的，真是“何患无辞”！但要真正使人信服，使人接受，那可不容易，因为“群众的眼睛是雪亮的”。所以，寄语这些同志，事情能办就办，应该办而暂时不能办，或者不想办的，也不妨直说，完全不必找一些五色缤纷、毫无用处的“理由”来为自己这种思想作掩护。
