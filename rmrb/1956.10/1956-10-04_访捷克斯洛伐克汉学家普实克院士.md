    Visiting Academician Průšek, a Czechoslovak Sinologist
    By Our Correspondent Lǐ Yánníng
    The car drove across the beautiful Charles Bridge and turned into a quiet little street – Lašská Street. This is a typical Prague street, clean and quiet, with quaint gas streetlights and stone-paved roads. Next to a church built in the Middle Ages is a four-story building with a sign hanging in front of it: "Oriental Institute of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences."
    We came here to visit Academician Jaroslav Průšek, the director of the Oriental Institute and a well-known European Sinologist and Orientalist. Just a few days before – on September 14th – this scholar, Communist Party member, and recipient of two Czechoslovak State Prizes, Academician Průšek, had just celebrated his fiftieth birthday.
    In front of a room on the second floor, a tall, energetic scholar extended his warm hand to welcome us. This was Academician Průšek.
    "Hello!" he said in Chinese, then introduced us to Dr. Krebsová, who was standing beside him. She was a relatively petite middle-aged woman, the director of the Sinology Department of the Oriental Institute, and a long-time colleague and collaborator of Academician Průšek.
    As soon as we entered, Academician Průšek enthusiastically told us that he had just returned from the International Conference of Sinologists in Paris, where he had happily met with Chinese scholars such as Jian Bozan. Moreover, on September 25th, he was going to lead a delegation from the Academy of Sciences to China.
    "This is your third trip to China, isn't it?" the reporter asked.
    "That's right. My first trip to China was before liberation, and the second was in 1951. Since then, I've always wanted to go to China again, but…" he pointed to his chest and told us that he had been unable to do so because of his heart condition. However, now the doctors say that his body can allow for such a long journey again.
    "It's been five years since 1951, and China must have made great progress again." Obviously, this friend of China, who has been committed to studying and introducing China for thirty years, is extremely happy to be able to go to China again. He enthusiastically told the reporter that Dr. Krebsová and another Sinologist also visited China in 1954. In 1955, three more Czechoslovak Sinologists visited China. "Almost every Sinologist in our institute has been to China," Academician Průšek said happily.
    What made Academician Průšek interested in Sinology? At our request, he began to recall events from thirty years ago. It was 1927, and the young Průšek had just graduated from Charles University in Prague. The earth-shaking Chinese Revolution aroused his strong interest in the ancient country of the East. At the same time, he was studying the history of the Eastern Roman Empire. In order to study the impact of the invasion of Europe by Asian peoples such as the Huns on European history, he felt that he also had to study China, because these peoples came from places near the Chinese border. Thus, Průšek decided to learn Chinese. That's how he embarked on the road of studying Sinology.
    At that time, there were no professors teaching Chinese at Charles University in Prague. Therefore, Průšek had to learn on his own. Later, he went abroad to Sweden and Germany to study further under some of the famous European Sinologists of the time. In 1932, he went to China.
    He spent most of his two years in China in Beijing. He met some Chinese friends, mostly progressive students at the time. His initial purpose in coming to China was to become familiar with Chinese economic history, but he found it difficult to understand the living conditions of the lower classes of Chinese people in history. In order to obtain materials in this regard, he began to study popular novels of the Song and Yuan dynasties. However, in the course of this process, he was deeply attracted by these Chinese folk literatures, so that he later devoted his energy and interest mainly to this aspect. This is how Průšek became an authority in the West on the study of Chinese literature, especially Chinese legends and novels.
    Early in China, Průšek paid close attention to China's new literature. At that time, he met Zheng Zhenduo and Shen Congwen, and later met Guo Moruo in Japan.
    Particularly noteworthy is his friendship with Mr. Lu Xun.
    "When I was in China," Academician Průšek said to us peacefully, "because I paid attention to Chinese new literature, some of my Chinese student friends introduced me to read Lu Xun's works. I liked his works very much. And you know, Mr. Lu Xun himself was very interested in the Chinese old novels and wrote the book 'A Brief History of Chinese Fiction'. At that time, I wrote to him to discuss some questions with him, and he quickly replied. In this way, we kept in touch until I was in Japan (Průšek went to Japan after 1934)."
    Academician Průšek was the first to introduce Lu Xun's works to Czechoslovakia. In 1937, the Czech version of "A Call to Arms" (including most of the Chinese version of "A Call to Arms") was published in Prague. In front of this book was a facsimile of the preface written by Mr. Lu Xun himself for the Czech version in July 1936 – three months before Mr. Lu Xun's death. In 1949, "My Old Home," co-translated by Academician Průšek and Dr. Krebsová, was published. "A Call to Arms" was reprinted in 1951, this time including not only the entire Chinese version of "A Call to Arms," but also "Wild Grass." This was also a collaboration between the two of them.
    The topic naturally turned to the introduction of Lu Xun's works. Academician Průšek pointed to Dr. Krebsová and said to us: "She specializes in the study of Lu Xun's works, and she is still continuing to translate Lu Xun's works." Dr. Krebsová told us that in addition to the above three works, Mr. Lu Xun's works also include "Wandering," "Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk," and "Old Tales Retold" which have been translated into Czech and published. Currently, they are planning to translate and publish a collection of Lu Xun's essays and letters. She also excitedly talked about her visit to China when she went to Shaoxing and visited Mr. Lu Xun's former residence. We told her and Academician Průšek that China is preparing to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Lu Xun's death. Academician Průšek said: "Maybe I will still be in China at that time."
    Academician Průšek not only introduced Lu Xun to Czechoslovakia, but he also translated Mao Dun's "Midnight." This book could not be published during the Nazi rule of Czechoslovakia, and it was not published until after the liberation of Czechoslovakia. He translated the poems of Li Bai and Du Fu, and also translated the poems of Chairman Mao and Ai Qing and Tian Jian. He translated "The Travels of Lao Can," "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," "Six Chapters of a Floating Life," and many Chinese legends. He also translated "The Art of War," "The Analects," and so on.
    It is even more difficult to list Academician Průšek's works on Sinology. His works cover many aspects, including literature, art, history, philosophy, and linguistics. Let us just list a few: "On Chinese Literature and Culture," "Chinese People's Literature," "Chinese Literature and Education," "New Chinese Literature," "Chairman Mao Zedong and Chinese Literature," "Literature After Liberation and Its People's Tradition." The last book earned him another Czechoslovak State Prize. Academician Průšek is not just a Sinologist who studies ancient books in his study. He also enthusiastically praises the Chinese Revolution and introduces the new China. From 1932, under the pen name "Batak," he wrote many newsletters and articles introducing the Chinese Revolution, the Chinese workers' movement, and the peasant movement in the Czechoslovak Communist Party's journal "Creator" (Julius Fučík was the editor of the journal). In 1935, he wrote about the advance of the Chinese Red Army. His book "China, My Sister," published in 1940, greatly enhanced the Czechoslovak people's understanding of China. After the founding of the new China, he introduced and praised the new China with even greater enthusiasm. In 1949, he published "The Chinese People Fighting for Freedom" and personally translated it into Slovak. This book has now been translated into Polish and Hungarian.
    As we looked at this tireless scholar with respect, we couldn't help but wonder about his future work plans. To this question, Academician Průšek replied that, first of all, he was preparing to write a book about the life and works of Pu Songling, and he hoped to show Pu Songling's progressive role in this book. He said that this famous Chinese writer not only wrote a work like "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," but also wrote some works popularizing science and did a lot of work to improve culture among the people at that time. In talking about this plan, Academician Průšek said that he heard that China had recently discovered Pu Songling's manuscripts, and he hoped to get a copy of this manuscript. He also said that he hoped to have the opportunity to visit Pu Songling's hometown in China to see the environment of the writer's creation and life. Průšek's future work plans also include: writing a book on Chinese medieval legendary novels and a book on ancient Chinese history. He hopes to find new information in this regard during his visit to China.
    After the conversation, the two Sinologists took us to the "Lu Xun Library" attached to the Oriental Institute on the third floor. The "Lu Xun Library" is exquisitely decorated. Rows of bookshelves against the wall are filled with Chinese books bound in thread and Western-style books. On the wall facing the door hangs a small horizontal plaque with the words "Lu Xun Library" written by Guo Moruo, under which stands a plaster statue of Mr. Lu Xun. On the wall next to the door hangs the national flag of the People's Republic of China and Mao Zedong's poems written by Ma Xulun. People cannot help but feel the deep friendship between China and Czechoslovakia when they see the careful arrangement in this library. The books collected here include the Complete Works of Lu Xun, the Grand Series of New Chinese Literature, Sibu Beiyao, Siku Zhenben, Sibu Congkan, Congshu Jicheng, Daqing Shilu, Tushu Jicheng, Wanyou Wenku, Gu Ben Xiqu Congkan, and many Buddhist scriptures. It is the library with the most Chinese literature books in Central Europe. Many of these books were collected by Academician Průšek during his visit to China in 1951. We praised the rich collection of books to the Academician, who smiled and said: "This is just a beginning." He told us that the book stalls in Liulichang and Dong'an Market were his regular haunts when he was in Beijing.
    We returned to the Academician's office. At this time, we saw a manuscript spread out on the table. It turned out to be a paper about Qu Yuan written by a Sinologist, and he was asking the Academician for his opinions. In addition, there was a galley proof of a paper called "The Creative Methods of Chinese Medieval Storytellers," which was the Academician's recent work, waiting for the Academician to make the final proofreading before going to press.
    Academician Průšek's profound knowledge of Chinese culture, his rigorous scholarship, and his rich works have made a significant contribution to Sino-Czechoslovak cultural exchange and the friendship between the people of China and Czechoslovakia. This short visit made us even more convinced of this.

    访捷克斯洛伐克汉学家普实克院士
    本报记者　李延宁
    汽车驶过美丽的查理士大桥，一拐弯开进了一条僻静的小街——拉申斯卡街。这是典型的布拉格小街之一，清洁而幽静，有着古色古香的煤气街灯和石块砌成的道路。在一座中世纪建造的教堂隔壁有一座四层的楼房，门前挂了一块牌子：“捷克斯洛伐克科学院东方研究所”。
    我们来到这里，为的是访问东方研究所所长、欧洲著名的汉学家和东方学家亚·普实克院士。只是在最近几天以前——9月14日，这位两次捷克斯洛伐克国家奖金的获得者、共产党员和学者普实克院士，刚刚度过了他的五十岁生日。
    在二楼的一间房间门前，一位身材高大精神饱满的学者伸出了他的热情的手来欢迎我们。这就是普实克院士。
    “你好！”他用中国话说道，接着就把我们介绍给站在他身旁的克列布索娃博士。这是一位比较瘦小的中年妇女，是东方研究所的汉学部主任，普实克院士长期来的同事和合作者。
    一进门，普实克院士就热情地告诉我们，他刚从巴黎参加了国际汉学家代表会议回来不久，在那里他曾和翦伯赞等中国学者愉快地聚会，而且9月25日他就要率领科学院的一个代表团去中国。
    “您这是第三次去中国了吧？”记者问道。
      “不错。我第一次去中国是在解放以前，第二次在1951年。在这以后我一直想再去中国，可是……”他用手指着胸前告诉我们，由于他的心脏病，一直未能如愿。不过，现在医生说他的身体已经可以允许再作这样一次长途旅行了。
    “从1951年到现在又是五年了，中国一定又有了很大的进步。”显然，这位三十年来一直致力于研究中国、介绍中国的中国之友，对于再能去中国是极为高兴的。他兴致勃勃地告诉记者，克列布索娃博士和另一位汉学家1954年也访问了中国。1955年又有三位捷克斯洛伐克汉学家访问了中国。“差不多我们研究所里的每一个汉学家都到中国去过了”，普实克院士高兴地说。
    是什么使普实克院士对汉学发生兴趣的呢？在我们的请求下，他开始追忆起三十年前的事来。那是1927年，年青的普实克刚从布拉格大学毕业不久，震荡世界的中国大革命使他对东方的古国发生了浓厚的兴趣。同时，他当时正在研究东罗马帝国的历史，为了研究匈奴等亚洲民族入侵欧洲对欧洲历史的影响，他感到也必须研究中国，因为这些民族都是来自接近中国边境的地方的。于是，普实克就决心学习中文。就是这样，他走上了研究汉学的道路。
    当时在布拉格大学没有教中文的教授。因此，普实克只好自学。以后，他又出国到瑞典、德国去跟随当时欧洲有名的一些汉学家求进一步的深造。1932年他到了中国。
    在中国的两年大部分时间是在北京度过的。他结识了一些中国朋友，大部分是当时的进步学生。来到中国，他的最初目的本是想熟习中国的经济史，但是他感到不易了解历史上中国下层群众的生活状况。为了取得这方面的材料，他着手去研究宋元朝代的通俗小说。但是，在这样的一个过程中他被这些中国民间文学深深地吸引住了，以致于以后把自己的精力和兴趣主要投入了这个方面。正是这样，普实克今天成为西方研究中国文学特别是中国传奇小说的权威。
    普实克早在中国的时候，就很注意中国的新文学。当时，他认识了郑振铎和沈从文，以后在日本又认识了郭沫若。
    特别值得注意的是他和鲁迅先生的友谊。
      “我在中国的时候，”普实克院士安详地对我们叙说道：“由于我注意中国的新文学，我的一些中国学生朋友就介绍我读鲁迅的作品。我非常喜欢他的作品。而且你们知道，鲁迅先生自己又对中国旧小说很有研究，写过‘中国小说史略’这本书。我当时就写信给他，同他讨论一些问题，很快他就回了信。这样，一直到我在日本的时候（普实克在1934年以后去日本），我们都保持通信。”
    普实克院士是第一个把鲁迅的著作介绍到捷克斯洛伐克的。1937年，在布拉格出版了捷文本的“呐喊”（包括中文本“呐喊”的大部分），在这本书的前面影印了鲁迅先生在1936年7月——也就是鲁迅先生逝世前三个月亲笔为捷文版写的序言。1949年又出版了普实克院士和克列布索娃博士合译的“故乡”。1951年重版了“呐喊”，这一次不仅包括了中文本“呐喊”的全部，而且还包括了“野草”。这也是他们两人合作翻译的。
    话题自然而然转到介绍鲁迅著作的问题了。普实克院士指着克列布索娃博士对我们说：“她是专门研究鲁迅著作的，她现在还在继续把鲁迅著作翻译过来呢。”克列布索娃博士告诉我们说，除了上述三部作品外，鲁迅先生的著作还有“彷徨”、“朝花夕拾”、“故事新编”已译成捷文出版，目前正计划翻译和出版鲁迅的杂文选集和书信集。她还兴致勃勃地谈起她访问中国时曾到了绍兴，参观了鲁迅先生故居。我们告诉她和普实克院士，中国正在筹备纪念鲁迅逝世二十周年，普实克院士说：“那时也许我还在中国吧。”
    普实克院士不仅向捷克斯洛伐克介绍了鲁迅，他也翻译了茅盾的“子夜”，这本书在纳粹统治捷克斯洛伐克时不能出版，一直到捷克斯洛伐克解放后才出版了。他翻译了李白、杜甫的诗，也翻译了毛主席和艾青、田间的诗。他翻译了“老残游记”、“聊斋志异”、“浮生六记”以及许多中国传奇，他也翻译了“孙子兵法”、“论语”等等。
    要历数普实克院士的关于汉学的著作是更不容易的。他的著作包括了文学、艺术、历史、哲学、语言学等许多方面。我们且举出几本来吧：“论中国文学与文化”、“中国人民文学”、“中国的文学与教育”、“新中国文学”、“毛泽东主席和中国文学”、“解放后的文学及其人民传统”。最后这一本书使他再一次地获得了捷克斯洛伐克国家奖金。普实克院士不是仅仅在书斋里钻研古书的汉学家，他还以极大的热情歌颂中国革命，介绍新中国。从1932年起，他就以“巴塔克”的笔名在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的党刊“创造者”（尤利乌斯·伏契克曾为该刊编辑）上写了许多篇介绍中国革命、中国工人运动和农民运动的通讯和文章。1935年他写过中国红军的前进。他在1940年出版的“中国，我的姊妹”一书大大增进了捷克斯洛伐克人民对中国的了解。在新中国成立以后，他以更大的热情来介绍和歌颂新中国。1949年他出版了“为自由而战斗的中国人民”，并且亲自又把它译成斯洛伐克文。这一本书现在已被译成波兰文和匈牙利文。
    当我们怀着敬意望着眼前这位三十年来孜孜不倦的学者时，我们不禁还想知道他未来的工作计划。对于这一问题，普实克院士回答说，首先他准备写一本关于蒲松龄生平及其著作的书，他希望在这本书中显示出蒲松龄的进步作用。他说，这位著名的中国文学家不仅写出了“聊斋志异”这样一本作品，而且还写过一些普及科学的著作并且当时在人民群众中做了不少提高文化的工作。在谈到这一计划时，普实克院士说，听说中国最近发现了蒲松龄的手稿，他很希望能得到这个手稿的抄本。他还说，这次他访问中国时希望有机会能到蒲松龄的故乡去亲自看看，以便能了解这位文学家的创作和生活的环境。普实克未来的工作计划还包括：写一本有关中国中世纪传奇小说的书和一本关于中国古代史的书。他希望这次去中国能找到这方面的新的资料。
    在谈话结束以后，两位汉学家把我们带到三楼去参观东方研究所附设的“鲁迅图书馆”。“鲁迅图书馆”布置得很精致。靠墙的一排排书架，放满了线装和洋装的中国书。正对着门的墙上挂着郭沫若书写的“鲁迅图书馆”的小幅横匾，下面放着石膏制成的鲁迅先生立像。门旁墙上挂着中华人民共和国的国旗和马叙伦书写的毛主席的诗词。人们看到这个图书馆中的精心布置，不能不亲切地感到中捷友谊的深厚。这里收藏的书包括鲁迅全集、中国新文学大系、四部备要、四库珍本、四部丛刊、丛书集成、大清实录、图书集成、万有文库、古本戏曲丛刊以及许多佛经，这是中欧收藏中国文学书籍最多的图书馆。其中许多书籍是普实克院士1951年访华时搜集来的。我们向院士赞扬藏书的丰富，院士笑着说：“这不过是一个开始而已”。他告诉我们，他在北京时，琉璃厂和东安市场的书摊是他常到之处。
    我们又回到院士的办公室。这时，我们看见桌上摊开着一篇文稿，原来这是一位汉学家写的关于屈原的论文，正请院士给他提供意见。另外，还有一本名叫“中国中世纪说书人的创作方法”的论文的清样，是院士的近作，正等待院士作最后的校阅后付印。
    普实克院士对中国文化的博学，他的严谨的治学态度和丰富的著作，已经对中捷文化交流和中捷两国人民的友谊作出了重大的贡献。这次短短的访问使我们更加确信了这一点。
