    “Position” Bonus
    The Luoyang Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering achieved excellent results in the construction of the First Tractor Factory. The Engineering Bureau decided to provide material rewards to these units. To facilitate the distribution of bonuses, the Engineering Bureau stipulated a distribution method: the bonus was divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. Section chiefs, Party committee secretaries, and some production and technical section chiefs were Grade A, receiving bonuses equal to 25% of their salary; other section-level cadres and the director of the dispatch room were Grade B, receiving bonuses equal to 20% of their salary; section members and clerical-level cadres were Grade C, receiving bonuses equal to 15% of their salary; other staff members were Grade D, receiving bonuses equal to 7.5% of their salary. A deputy director of the 104th Section, who often held his child during office hours, was no exception, enjoying a Grade A bonus; while some recognized advanced workers, simply because they were clerks, could only enjoy a Grade D bonus.
    Please tell me: Is the purpose of this reward to reward the advanced, or to reward the work position?

    “职位”奖金
    建筑工程部洛阳工程局，在建设第一拖拉机厂时，有很多单位创造了优异的成绩。工程局决定给予这些单位以物质奖励。为了便于分配奖金，工程局规定一项分配的办法：把奖金分为甲、乙、丙、丁四等。工区主任、党委书记和部分生产、技术科长为甲等，按工资的25％分奖金；其他科级干部和调度室主任为乙等，按工资20％分奖金；科员、办事员级干部为丙等，按工资15％分奖金；其它工作人员为丁等，按工资7.5％分奖金。一○四工区的一位副主任，经常在办公时间抱孩子，也不例外地享受着甲等奖励；而有的被公认的先进工作者，只因为他是一个办事员，因此就只能享受丁等奖金。
    请问：这种奖励的目的，是奖励先进呢？还是奖励工作职位呢？
