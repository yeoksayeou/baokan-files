Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, October 27th: The design personnel of the Yumen Mining Bureau Design Institute, with the help of Soviet experts, recently completed the general design of China's first natural petroleum mine – the Yumen Oilfield.

According to the overall design, 1957 will be the year with the largest basic construction tasks for the Yumen Oilfield, and crude oil production will also greatly exceed the level of 1956. At the Laojunmiao Oilfield, a new batch of oil separation stations, several natural gas compressor stations, and a natural gas oil plant will be built, while a batch of water injection plants will also be expanded. The water supply, oil transportation, and gas transmission pipeline networks of the Laojunmiao and Shiyougou oilfields will also be completed. A large-scale thermal power plant will also be built in 1957.

In order to improve the cultural and welfare life of employees, the Yumen Oilfield will also build cultural palaces, cinemas, theaters, hospitals, schools, nurseries, kindergartens, parks, food processing plants, and a number of employee residences. In addition, the natural gas pipeline currently used for residents' cooking and heating will also be expanded.

In the past few years, the construction of the Yumen Oilfield has often been unable to be arranged in a planned manner in production and construction due to the lack of overall planning, and the existing equipment has also been difficult to utilize rationally. With the overall design of the mining area, the construction of the oilfield can be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner in the future.

    全面安排生产和建设
    玉门油矿完成总体设计
    新华社兰州27日电　玉门矿务局设计院设计人员在苏联专家帮助下，最近完成了我国第一个天然石油矿——玉门油矿的总体设计。
    根据总体设计，1957年玉门油矿将是基本建设任务最大的一年，原油产量也要大大超过1956年的水平。在老君庙油田上，将要新建一批选油站、几座天然气压缩机站和一座天然气油厂，同时还要扩建一批注水厂。老君庙和石油沟油田的供水、输油、输气管线网也要建成。1957年内还要兴建一座规模巨大的热电站。
    为了提高职工的文化福利生活，玉门油矿还将新建文化宫、电影院、剧院、医院、学校、托儿所、幼儿园、公园、食品加工厂和一批职工住宅。此外还要扩建目前供居民煮饭、取暖用的天然气管线。
    过去几年来，玉门油矿的建设由于缺乏全面规划，在生产和建设上常常不能有计划地安排，现有设备也很难得到合理利用。有了矿区总体设计，今后油矿的建设就可以有计划、有步骤地进行了。
