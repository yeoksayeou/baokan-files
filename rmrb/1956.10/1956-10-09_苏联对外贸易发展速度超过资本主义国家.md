　　Soviet Union's Foreign Trade Develops Faster Than Capitalist Countries
　　"Party Life" of the Soviet Union carried an article saying: In 1955, the total value of foreign trade of capitalist countries in the world increased only by 60% compared with before the war, while the Soviet Union increased more than three times during the same period.
    Moscow dispatch from our newspaper on the 8th. The development speed of the Soviet Union's foreign trade has far exceeded that of capitalist countries. In 1955, the total value of foreign trade of capitalist countries in the world increased by only 60% compared with before World War II, and the largest increase was in the United States - an increase of just over double. During the same period, the total value of the Soviet Union's foreign trade increased more than three times. This was stated by Artyomov in an article in the latest issue of "Party Life" magazine.
    He said: Under the completely new trade principles of mutual assistance, the Soviet Union first expanded the volume of trade with the people's democratic countries. In 1955, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries increased by approximately 9 billion rubles compared with 1950, and the Soviet Union's trade with the people's democratic countries accounted for approximately four-fifths of the Soviet Union's total foreign trade. The majority of Soviet exports are industrial machinery and equipment.
    He also said: The United States is doing its utmost to use economic blockades to prevent economic and trade exchanges between other countries and socialist countries, attempting to hinder the economic development of the people's democratic countries. But the facts are just the opposite, the economies of socialist countries are developing and prospering day by day. When Artyomov talked about the Soviet Union's expansion of equal trade with economically underdeveloped countries, he said: The Soviet Union has closely established economic and trade cooperation with countries such as India, Burma, Afghanistan, and Egypt. The Soviet Union has also further cooperated with these countries in science and technology. This equal trade and technical assistance enables these economically underdeveloped countries to rapidly develop their national economies.
    Artyomov also said that under the principle of equality and mutual benefit, the Soviet Union has also expanded trade with Western European capitalist countries such as France, Britain, Finland, Norway, Denmark, and Austria. In 1956, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and Finland will exceed 1 billion rubles. In 1956, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and France is planned to increase by 30%. Since 1955, the Soviet Union has increased exports of timber, cotton, manganese ore, coal and other products to the United Kingdom, while greatly increasing imports of various products from the United Kingdom.
    In 1955, the total value of Soviet Union's foreign trade reached more than 25 billion rubles. In world trade, the Soviet Union's position has risen from sixteenth to sixth, and the Soviet Union's trade volume continues to grow. At present, the Soviet Union has established trade relations with more than 60 countries.

　　苏联对外贸易发展速度超过资本主义国家
　　苏联“党的生活”载文说：1955年世界资本主义国家对外贸易总值比战前只增加了60％，而同期苏联却增加了三倍多。
    本报莫斯科8日电　苏联对外贸易的发展速度已远远超过了资本主义国家。1955年世界资本主义国家对外贸易总值比第二次世界大战前只增加了60％，其中增加得最多的是美国——增加了一倍多一点。而同时期的苏联对外贸易总值却增加了三倍多。这是阿尔歇莫夫在最近一期“党的生活”杂志上写的一篇文章中说的。
    他说：在互相帮助的完全新的贸易原则下，苏联首先扩大了对人民民主国家的贸易量。1955年苏联同各人民民主国家的贸易额比1950年增加了约九十亿卢布，苏联对人民民主国家的贸易约占苏联整个对外贸易额的五分之四。苏联出口的商品大部分是工业机器装备。
    他又说：美国极力使用经济封锁来阻止其他国家同社会主义国家之间的经济和贸易往来，企图阻挠人民民主国家的经济发展。但事实恰恰相反，社会主义国家的经济却日益发展和繁荣。阿尔歇莫夫在谈到苏联扩大了同经济不发达国家的平等贸易时说：苏联已紧密地同印度、缅甸、阿富汗、埃及等国建立了经济和贸易的合作。苏联对这些国家在科学和技术上也进行了进一步的合作。这种平等的贸易和技术帮助使这些经济不发达国家有可能迅速发展自己的国民经济。
    阿尔歇莫夫还说，在平等互利的原则下，苏联还扩大了同法国、英国、芬兰、挪威、丹麦、奥地利等西欧资本主义国家的贸易。1956年苏联同芬兰的贸易额将超过十亿卢布，1956年苏联同法国之间的贸易额计划增加30％，1955年起苏联增加对英国木材、棉花、锰矿、煤等输出品，同时大大增加了从英国进口的各种产品。
    1955年，苏联对外贸易的总值达到二百五十亿卢布以上。在世界贸易中，苏联所占的地位已从第十六位提高到第六位，苏联的贸易额还在继续增长。目前苏联已同六十多个国家建立了贸易关系。
