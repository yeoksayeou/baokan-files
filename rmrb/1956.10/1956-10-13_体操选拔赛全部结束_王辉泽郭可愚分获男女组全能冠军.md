Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The Chinese Olympic team's gymnastics trials concluded today. Guo Keyu, a sixteen-year-old female athlete from Tianjin, and Wang Huize, a male athlete from Heilongjiang Province, won the first place in the women's all-around (four events) and the men's all-around (six events) respectively.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi watched today's trials, which were held in the competition hall of the Beijing Gymnasium. Both male and female athletes competed in optional routines.

    The young Guo Keyu originally ranked second in the compulsory routines competition on the 10th, after Zhang Feizi from Guangdong Province. Today, she had excellent performances in all four optional routines, with scores exceeding nine points in each event (out of a full score of ten). Therefore, the sum of her scores in compulsory and optional routines surpassed all her opponents, placing her first (with a score of 73.27 out of a full score of 80). She also won first place in the uneven bars.

    Zhang Feizi's total score was affected today because she failed to exceed nine points in the side horse vault event (she scored 8.63 points). Her total score was 72.70, placing her fourth.

    The famous female gymnasts Qi Yufang and Chen Xiaozhang both scored quite high in the various optional routines today, but because their scores in the compulsory routines were relatively low, their total scores failed to surpass Guo Keyu. They scored 73.09 and 73 points respectively, ranking second and third. However, Chen Xiaozhang still won first place in both floor exercise and side horse vault; Qi Yufang won first place in the balance beam.

    In the men's division, the slender Wang Huize performed quite well in each optional routine. Although he did not win first place in any of the six individual events, his total score in compulsory and optional routines still surpassed every opponent. He obtained 110.75 points out of a possible 120 points.

    Lu Enchun, an athlete from Beijing, ranked second in the men's all-around total score, with a total of 109.70 points.

    The famous male gymnast Bao Naijian won first place in floor exercise, parallel bars, and rings, but because he scored relatively low in pommel horse, long horse vault, and horizontal bar, his total score only ranked third, with 109.45 points.

    The first place in the men's horizontal bar, pommel horse, and long horse vault events were won by Han Yi from Jiangsu Province, Xu Renjie from Beijing, and Xia Dejun from Liaoning respectively.

    体操选拔赛全部结束
    王辉泽郭可愚分获男女组全能冠军
    新华社12日讯　中国奥林匹克运动队体操选拔赛今天结束，天津市十六岁的女运动员郭可愚和黑龙江省的男运动员王辉泽分别获得了女子四项全能和男子六项全能的第一名。
    刘少奇委员长观看了今天的选拔赛。选拔赛在北京体育馆比赛馆中举行。男、女运动员都比赛自选动作。
    年轻的郭可愚原来在10日的规定动作比赛中，得分仅次于广东省选手张飞子而占第二位。她今天在四项自选动作中都有着良好的表演，每项得分都超过了九分（满分是十分），因此她规定动作和自选动作得分的总和超过了所有的对手占了第一位（是七十三·二七分，满分是八十分）。她还获得了高低杠的第一名。
    张飞子今天因为在横跳马比赛中，成绩没能超过九分（她得了八·六三分），因此影响了总成绩。她的总成绩是七十二·七○分，占了第四位。
    著名的女子体操运动员戚玉芳和陈孝彰今天在各项自选动作中得分都相当高，可是由于她们规定动作的得分比较少，因此总成绩都没能超过郭可愚，只达到了七十三·○九分和七十三分，分别占了第二位和第三位。但是陈孝彰仍然获得了自由体操和横跳马两项第一名；戚玉芳获得了平衡木的第一名。
    在男子组方面，身材削瘦的王辉泽每项自选动作都作得相当好，虽然他在六个单项比赛中都没能获得第一名，但是他规定动作和自选动作的总分仍然超过了每一个对手。他获得了可能获得的一百二十分中的一百一十点七五分。
    男子全能总分占第二位的是北京市选手陆恩淳，他共得了一百零九点七○分。
    著名的男子体操运动员鲍乃健这次虽然获得了自由体操、双杠和吊环三项第一名，但是由于他在鞍马、纵跳马和单杠三项比赛中得分比较少，所以他的总分只占了第三位，是一百零九点四五分。
    男子单杠、鞍马和纵跳马三项比赛的第一名分别由江苏省的韩毅、北京的徐仁杰和辽宁的夏德君获得。
