    Abolish Unreasonable Systems in Commercial Work
    Cai Ping
    Recently, this newspaper has received many letters from readers reflecting that there are many unreasonable systems in commercial work that cause great inconvenience to consumers. For example, residents of Yangliuqing Town in the suburbs of Tianjin are very fond of using soap and matches produced in Tianjin, but they cannot buy them. Because according to the sales system of each having "market leadership" and "planned control," the Yangliuqing Department Store can only purchase goods from the Hebei Provincial Department Store Wholesale Supply Station. The Hebei Provincial Department Store Wholesale Supply Station supplies products from other regions of Hebei Province; and the regulations do not allow the commercial departments of Tianjin to sell goods in Yangliuqing.
    For another example, the thread blankets sold in the Yidu County Department Store in Shandong Province are produced in Weixian, with low quality and high prices. The thread blankets produced in Qingdao are better in color and quality than those produced in Weixian, and each blanket is also cheaper by ninety cents. However, the Weixian Department Store insists that the stores under its jurisdiction sell Weixian products. It is said that this is the sales principle of "districts have district boundaries," "provinces have provincial boundaries," and "internal first, external later."
    These "systems" and "principles" have formed mutual blockades in commercial operations, artificially severing the natural laws of commodity circulation, increasing the links in commodity sales, and making consumers feel inconvenient.
    These systems were originally stipulated by the national economic departments to limit the speculative activities of capitalist industry and commerce, which was completely necessary at that time. At that time, although there were inconveniences for people's purchases, people could understand it in order to limit capitalism. But today, when capitalist industry and commerce have all implemented joint state-private ownership, and the capitalist free market has been replaced by the purchasing and marketing relationship led by socialism, if these methods are not gradually changed, abnormal situations will occur, which will be detrimental to the people.
    However, some people believe that changing these systems and principles involves too many aspects, including the commodity allocation system, price policies, industrial production issues, and so on. The implication is that it is not easy to change them for the time being. We do not deny the complexity of this issue, but we cannot be satisfied with their hesitant attitude. Systems are stipulated by people, and since people can stipulate systems, they can of course revise and change them. Systems are stipulated to do a good job, and when they are no longer suitable for objective conditions, they should be gradually changed and abolished; if these measures continue to be taken regardless of objective circumstances, they will inevitably hinder the further development of the national economy.
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the political report made on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Eighth National Congress: "Many measures concerning purchasing and marketing relations taken during the period of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist enterprises must now be changed and replaced by measures suitable for the current economic situation." We hope that relevant departments will adopt a positive attitude and gradually improve the current market management methods in accordance with this spirit. In the future, no place in the country should block each other, and goods from any place in the country should be allowed to enter any place for sale. In this way, goods can be circulated smoothly and promote the further development of the national economy.

    取消商业工作中不合理的制度
    蔡平
    最近，本报接到很多读者来信，反映商业工作中有不少不合理的制度，给消费者带来了很大的不方便。例如：天津近郊杨柳青镇的居民，很喜欢使用天津出产的肥皂和火柴，但是买不到。因为按照各有“市场领导”和“计划控制”的销售制度，杨柳青百货公司只能向河北省百货公司批发供应站进货。河北省百货公司批发供应站供应的却都是河北省其他地区的产品；而制度规定又不准许天津市的商业部门到杨柳青销售货物。
    又例如：山东省益都县百货商店销售的线毯子是潍县生产的，质量低、价钱高。青岛生产的线毯子，无论色泽、质量都比潍县的产品好，每条毯子还便宜九角钱。可是潍县百货公司却硬要它管辖的商店销售潍县的产品。据说，这是“区有区界”、“省有省界”、“先内后外”的销售原则。
    这些“制度”和“原则”，形成了商业经营中的相互封锁，人为的割裂了商品流转的自然规律，增加了商品销售中的环节，使消费者感到不方便。
    这些制度原是国家经济部门为了限止资本主义工商业的投机活动而规定的，这在当时是完全必要的。在那个时候，尽管对人民的购买也有不方便之处，可是为了限止资本主义，人民是可以谅解的。但是今天，在资本主义工商业已全部实行公私合营，资本主义的自由市场已被社会主义领导的购销关系所代替的情况下，如果不逐步改变这些办法，就会产生不正常的情况，对人民不利。
    然而，有些人认为，改变这些制度和原则牵连面太广，它牵连到商品调拨制度、价格政策、工业生产问题等等。言外之意，暂时还不好改变。我们不否认这个问题的复杂性，但是我们不能满意他们这种举足不前的态度。制度是人规定的，人既能规定制度，当然也就能修正、改变制度。制度是为了做好工作才规定的，当它已经不适合客观条件的时候，就应该逐步改变和取消它；如果不顾客观情况，继续采取这些措施，就必然会妨碍国民经济的进一步发展。
    刘少奇同志代表中国共产党中央委员会向第八次全国代表大会所作的政治报告中已经指出：“在利用、限制、改造资本主义企业时期所采取的许多关于购销关系的措施，现在必须改变，代之以适合于目前经济情况的措施。”我们希望有关部门根据这一精神，采取积极的态度逐步地改进现行的市场管理办法。今后，全国任何地方，都不该互相封锁，应该允许全国任何地方的商品进入任何一地去销售。这样，才可以使货畅其流，促进国民经济进一步的发展。
