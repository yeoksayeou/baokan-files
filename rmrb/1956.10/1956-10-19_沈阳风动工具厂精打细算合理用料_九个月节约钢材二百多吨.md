Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The workers of Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory have been meticulously practicing economy in the use of metal materials. From January to September this year, they saved a total of more than 240 tons of valuable steel, enough to manufacture more than 2,400 rock drills.

    This year, along with the emergence of various advanced experiences, the factory's technicians successively revised the technological regulations for more than 300 kinds of parts, making the consumption quota of metal materials more economical and rational. On some components, the successful use of the nesting knife created by technician Xu Lian'gui saved more than 30 tons of steel in the first half of the year alone. Simple components, after being made by free forging instead of die forging, also saved a lot of steel. In addition, workers and technicians also studied how to utilize all material ends and burrs; even scraps like iron wire are used as welding rods.

    The supply personnel improved the material distribution and requisition system, and further strengthened the management and recycling of leftover materials and material ends.

    In order to make saving metal materials a regular task, the factory formulates monthly savings plans, stipulates specific targets and measures, and assigns them to departments and workshops on time, and then mobilizes the masses to discuss and guarantee their realization.

    沈阳风动工具厂精打细算合理用料
    九个月节约钢材二百多吨
    据新华社讯　沈阳风动工具厂职工精打细算地使用金属材料，在今年1月到9月中共节约了二百四十多吨贵重钢材，可以用来制造二千四百多台凿岩机。
    这个厂的工艺人员，今年随着新出现的各种先进经验，先后修改了三百多种零件的工艺规程，使金属材料消耗定额更加经济合理。在有些部件上，成功地使用了技术员徐连贵创造的套料刀，在今年上半年就节约了三十多吨钢料。有些简单的部件，用自由锻代替模锻以后，也节省了很多钢料。此外，工人和技艺员还研究把一切料头、毛边都加以利用；甚至像铁丝一样的边料，也利用来作焊条。
    供应人员健全了材料发放和领用制度，进一步加强了对余料、料头的管理和回用。
    这个厂为了使节约金属材料成为经常的任务，每月都订出节约计划，规定出具体的指标和措施，按时布置到科室和车间，然后发动群众来讨论和保证实现。
