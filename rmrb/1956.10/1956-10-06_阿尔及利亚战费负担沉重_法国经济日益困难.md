Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 2nd: The military actions in Algeria are exacerbating France's economic difficulties.

    Government officials also acknowledge that the war in Algeria is having an adverse impact on the French economy. Finance Minister Ramadier, in a conversation with reporters from the French economic press, said that in next year's budget, major civilian expenditures, including construction funds and social project costs, would be reduced by 300 billion francs in order to "save costs." Ramadier also admitted that the so-called "Algerian deficit" would increase by another 50 billion francs next year.
