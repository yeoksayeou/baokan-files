Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th. Last night, 1,200 student representatives from Guangzhou gathered to demand that the British authorities in Hong Kong severely punish the culprits who created the Kowloon riot incident, take responsibility for consoling and providing relief to the affected compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and ensure the safety of the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

Huang Hanhua, chairman of the Guangzhou Student Union, strongly condemned at the meeting the crimes of Kuomintang secret agents leading thugs to kill Kowloon compatriots and destroy schools. Huang Hanhua said that Kuomintang secret agents killed and set fires in Kowloon, and they did not even spare pregnant women, children, and our young students. Some schools were also destroyed. Anyone with a little conscience would gnash their teeth at this kind of inhumane behavior. He went on to say that the British authorities in Hong Kong have not yet resolutely arrested and punished the Kuomintang secret agent leaders who harmed the Kowloon compatriots. This cannot ensure the safety of the lives and property of the Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots in the future.

At the meeting, many student representatives pointed out, what is the intention of the British authorities in Hong Kong in condoning and shielding the Kuomintang secret agent criminals? Zhuo Qihan, a student representative from Sun Yat-sen University, believes that the British authorities in Hong Kong are reversing right and wrong, and they are simply trying to exonerate the Kuomintang secret agents and shirk their own responsibility. He went on to say that this kind of lie that reverses black and white is self-defeating in the face of well-known facts. For several years, Kuomintang secret agents have regarded Hong Kong as their nest, and recently they sent secret agents from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, attempting to detonate public places in Guangzhou at the same time as the Kowloon riots.

Zheng Baozi, a female student from Guangzhou No. 30 Middle School, whose family lives in Kowloon, said, "The fate of my family is still unknown. I have even more right to demand that the British authorities in Hong Kong immediately severely punish the culprits and provide relief to the victims." All the representatives applauded warmly in support of her request.

The student representatives attending the meeting also passed a letter of condolence from the city's students to the affected compatriots in Kowloon, and signed the names of the student unions of each school and their own names on the red silk cloth of condolence to the affected compatriots.

    广州学生集会
    要求香港当局严惩祸首  并抚恤救济我受害同胞
    新华社广州18日电　广州市学生代表一千二百人在昨天晚上集会要求香港英国当局严惩制造九龙暴乱事件的祸首，并对受害的港九同胞负责抚恤、救济，确保港九同胞的安全。
    广州市学生联合会主席黄汉华在大会上痛斥国民党特务带领暴徒杀害九龙同胞和摧毁学校的罪行。黄汉华说，国民党特务在九龙杀人放火，连孕妇、小孩和我们正在念书的青年少年也不肯放过，有些学校也被捣毁，对这种灭绝人性的行为，凡是稍有良心的人都会咬牙切齿。他接着说，但香港英国当局至今却没有坚决逮捕和惩办这些残害九龙同胞的祸首国民党特务头子。这就不能确保今后港九同胞生命财产的安全。
    会上，许多学生代表都指出，香港英国当局这种纵容包庇国民党特务罪魁的态度究竟为的是什么？中山大学学生代表卓戚汉认为，香港英国当局颠倒黑白是非，无非是企图为国民党特务开脱罪行，为自己推卸责任。他接着说，这种颠倒黑白的谎言在人所共知的事实面前是不攻自破的。国民党特务几年来都把香港作为他们的巢穴，最近又从香港派遣特务到广州来，企图与九龙骚乱的同时，爆炸广州的公共场所。
    广州第三十中学女学生郑宝慈的全家住在九龙。她说，我的家人至今还是生死不明，我更有权利要求香港英国当局立即严惩祸首，救济受难者。全体代表热烈鼓掌，支持她的要求。
    到会的学生代表在会上还通过了全市学生给九龙受难同胞的慰问电，同时在慰问受难同胞的红绸布上签上各校学生会和自己的名字。
