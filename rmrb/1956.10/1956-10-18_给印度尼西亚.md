    To Indonesia
    Bao Chang
    I heard Indonesia is as beautiful as a poem, with equatorial nights bathed in dreamlike moonlight; jasmine blossoms radiantly white at night, and peacocks soaring on dark blue waters... I heard Indonesia is as ancient as a legend, an ancient nation, with both joy and sorrow. The ancient zither of Bali, the bugles of Ijo, together symphony in the chapters of your history. Through blood and sword, through roads of烽火狼烟, you stand up, my dear neighbor! On the banks of the Solo River, your national flag is waving heroically, it burns with the "Merdeka" ideal of the Indonesian people. "Merdeka" – this sacred word surges in our common hearts. How delighted I am that your envoys have come to our side. Come, dear brothers, Beijing has prepared the best auditorium for you, let us together cheer for the newly rising sun of Asia!

    给印度尼西亚
    鲍昌听说印度尼西亚像诗一样美丽，赤道之夜有着梦一般的月光；茉莉花白艳艳地在夜间开放，孔雀在暗蓝的水面上翱翔……听说印度尼西亚像传奇一样悠久，悠久的民族呵，有欢乐也有悲伤。那峇厘岛的古琴，那埃约地方的军号，一齐在你历史的乐章上交响。穿过血与剑，穿过烽火狼烟的道路，你站起来了，我亲爱的邻邦！梭罗河畔，你的国旗在英勇地飘扬，它燃烧着印度尼西亚人民“默地加”的理想。“默地加”——这神圣的字眼在我们共同的
    心中冲荡，我多么喜悦，你的使节来到我们的身旁。来吧，亲爱的兄弟，北京为你们准备
    了最好的礼堂，让我们一同来欢呼亚细亚新升的太阳！
