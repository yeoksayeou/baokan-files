    Mother-in-Law and Mother
    Feng Ming
    Some folk artists describe their current situation with a phrase, "many mothers-in-law, few mothers," which is quite "laden with emotion."
    It should be stated, however, that the "mother-in-law" here is used in its "ancient sense." In the new society, the meaning of "mother-in-law" has already changed.
    Since liberation, the social status of folk artists has undergone fundamental changes, and their labor has generally been respected. But if we don't only see the big picture and ignore the details, we will see and hear many things that are completely incompatible with the new social customs, and we will understand that the folk artists' lament of "many mothers-in-law, few mothers" is not without reason.
    There are such things: if folk professional troupes go on tour to various places and don't give out tickets or entertain certain "authorities" to watch the performances, they cannot perform smoothly. And for folk artists, there are so many authority figures. In addition to the local cultural authorities, the public security, tax, grain, health, transportation, and other departments, as well as district and township cadres and militiamen, etc., can all become their superiors. Failure to cater to any one of them or inadequate hospitality can cause unexpected complications. Some personnel from the public security department can use "checking household registration" as an excuse to search the troupe's dormitory late at night; some cadres from the grain department can use reducing food rations to threaten them; if the transportation department shows a little displeasure and delays the transport of stage equipment by a day or two, that's enough to make you suffer. In some places, scenery is taxed, and there is also a so-called "advertising posting tax" for posting posters. Rather than paying these taxes under various pretexts, it is better to send a few tickets and ask them to be lenient. As for things like interrupting performances to inspect hygiene, causing lime dust to fly in the auditorium and making the audience glare, these are not entirely unheard of. In one place, such a thing happened: the troupe offended an "authority figure" in the local health department, so this gentleman prescribed a hygiene agreement for the troupe, one of which stipulated that all personnel on stage must wear "hygiene clothing." The comrades in the troupe asked: Does this also include the actors? The answer was: Yes. I ask you, if Su San, who is being escorted on stage, does not wear her prisoner's clothes and skirt but puts on the white coat of a health and epidemic prevention worker, what play can she perform? -- In a word, this is making things difficult. Of course, people with this kind of tricky and difficult temperament are in the minority in today's society, in these departments. But these very few people have found in the folk artists a good target to show their power and exercise their authority, so it is no wonder that the folk artists have a feeling of being a submissive daughter-in-law everywhere.
    The cultural authorities in various places, in principle, should treat folk artists with more kindness and provide more care. But in reality, nitpicking, criticism, and unreasonable interference are often more common than genuine care and encouragement. Here, there seems to be a lack of the warmth of a "mother" and more of the old-fashioned "mother-in-law" style.
    This situation should be changed. I believe that the cultural authorities must first get rid of the "mother-in-law" attitude towards folk artists and should show the warmth of a "mother." Even if they don't have the warmth of a "mother," they should at least have the duty of an elder brother -- like what is written in the Huangmei Opera "Shazigang," they should come out to protect their sister who is being tormented by her mother-in-law; public opinion should also uphold justice. We don't need to use an awl against those who like to show off their mother-in-law's power, we can use the method of persuasion and education to advise them; of course, against those stubborn and unreasonable shrewish mother-in-laws, it may be necessary to use weapons when necessary, but not awls, but the laws and disciplines of our country.

    婆婆和娘
    冯明
    有些民间艺人形容他们目前的处境，有一句话，叫作“婆婆多娘少”，颇有“感慨系之”的味道。
    但应该声明的是，这里所说的“婆婆”，用的是“古义”。在新社会里，“婆婆”这概念的含义已经起了变化了。
    解放以后，民间艺人们的社会地位有了根本的变化，民间艺人们的劳动一般地也受到了尊重。但如果我们不是只见大而不见小，那末就会看到、听到许多和新社会的风尚绝不相容的事情，也会了解到民间艺人的“婆婆多娘少”的慨叹不是没有来由的。
    有这样的事情：民间职业剧团到各地巡回演出，不送票，不招待某些“权威人士”看戏，就不能顺利演出。而对于民间艺人来说，权威人士又是如此之多，除了各地文化主管部门以外，公安、税务、粮食、卫生、交通等等部门以及区乡干部、民兵等等，都可以成为他们的顶头上司。哪一方面应付不到，招待不周，都可以引起意外的波折。公安部门的某些人员可以用“查户口”的名义深夜搜查剧团宿舍；粮食部门的某些干部，可以用减发口粮来加以威胁；交通运输部门只要稍微显点颜色，把戏箱晚运那么一天两天，也就够你受的。有的地方，布景要上税，张贴海报，也有所谓“广告张贴税”，与其交这些巧立名目的税款，就不如送几张戏票，请他们高抬贵手之为得计了。至于在开演中途，借口检查卫生，弄得场内石灰飞扬，观众侧目之类的事情，也不是绝无仅有的；某地还发生过这样的事：剧团得罪了当地卫生部门的一位“权威人士”，于是这位老爷就给剧团订了一份卫生公约，其中有一条，规定舞台上的人员一律得穿“卫生服”，剧团的同志问：演员是否也包括在内？答曰：在内。试问，舞台上起解的苏三，如果不穿罪衣罪裙，而穿上卫生防疫人员的白大褂，那还演什么戏呢？——一言以蔽之，这是刁难。当然，具有这种刁钻难缠脾气的人，在今天的社会上，在这些部门里，都是少数。但这很少数的人，都在民间艺人身上发现了可以逞威风，施权柄的好对手，那就无怪民间艺人要有处处作小媳妇之感了。
    各地的文化主管部门，按理说，对待民间艺人是应该较为亲切，较多地予以关怀的。但实际上，挑剔、指摘和无理的干涉，也往往多于真正的爱护和鼓励。在这里，似乎也少有作“娘”的热肠，而多的是老气横秋的“婆婆”作风。
    这种情况是应该加以改变了。我以为，文化主管部门首先要去掉对待民间艺人的“婆婆”作风，而应该拿出作“娘”的热肠来，即使没有作“娘”的热肠，起码也应该有作娘家哥哥的义务——像黄梅戏“沙子岗”里所写的那样，应该出来保护受婆婆折磨的妹妹；社会舆论，也应该主持正义。对待那些喜欢逞婆婆威风的人，我们不必用锥子，我们可以用说服教育的方法去加以规劝；当然，对待那些冥顽不灵的刁姑恶婆，必要时也许要用用武器的，不过也不是锥子，而是我们国家的法纪。
