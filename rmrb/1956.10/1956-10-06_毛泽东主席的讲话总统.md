President, friends, comrades:
    On this important occasion of the 11th anniversary of the founding of the Indonesian Armed Forces, I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations to President Sukarno, the Supreme Commander of the Indonesian Armed Forces. I congratulate the heroic Indonesian Armed Forces on achieving even greater success in the struggle to realize the ideals of the Indonesian people.

    What are the Indonesian people's ideals? President Sukarno has made it very clear in his recent important speeches to us, that is: the ideal of independence, the ideal of peace, and the ideal of a new world. These are also the ideals of the Chinese people. In order to strive to realize these ideals, the Chinese people stand on the same front as the Indonesian people, and will always be the loyal comrades-in-arms of the Indonesian people.

    Mr. President, for six days, you have seen the Chinese people's welcome and love for you. Your visit has brought our two peoples closer than ever before. Tomorrow, you will leave Beijing, and soon after, you will leave China. Although we will be separated by thousands of kilometers again, our hearts, the hearts of our two peoples, will be closely linked together.

    I propose:
    For the eternal friendship between our two peoples,
    To the health of President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia, the Supreme Commander of the Indonesian Armed Forces, cheers!

### 毛泽东主席的讲话总统

    毛泽东主席的讲话总统阁下，朋友们，同志们：
    在印度尼西亚建军十一周年这个重要的节日，我首先要向苏加诺总统、印度尼西亚共和国武装部队的最高统帅，表示衷心的祝贺。我祝贺英勇的印度尼西亚共和国武装部队在争取实现印度尼西亚人民理想的斗争中，取得更大的成就。
    什么是印度尼西亚人的理想呢？苏加诺总统在最近对我们所作的几次重要的演说中，已经说得很明白，那就是：独立的理想、和平的理想、新世界的理想。这些也正是中国人民的理想。为了争取实现这些理想，中国人民同印度尼西亚人民站在一条战线上，而且永远是印度尼西亚人民忠实的战友。
    总统阁下，六天来，你已经看到了中国人民对你的欢迎和敬爱。你的访问已经使我们两国人民比任何时候都更加接近。明天，你就要离开北京，不久以后，你就要离开中国。虽然我们又将要相隔几千公里，但是，我们的心，我们两国人民的心，将会紧紧地联系在一起。
    我建议：
    为我们两国人民永恒的友谊，
    为印度尼西亚共和国总统、印度尼西亚共和国武装部队的最高统帅苏加诺阁下的健康，干杯！
