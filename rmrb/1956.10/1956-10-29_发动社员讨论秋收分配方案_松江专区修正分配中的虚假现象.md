    Launching Commune Member Discussions on Autumn Harvest Distribution Plans: Songjiang Special District Corrects False Phenomena in Distribution

    (Reported by this newspaper) Agricultural cooperatives in Songjiang Special District, Jiangsu Province, have generally conducted supplementary lessons on distribution trial calculations, correcting false phenomena in the distribution trial calculation plans.

    In the previous period, some agricultural cooperatives in the Songjiang area, when formulating distribution trial calculation plans, exaggerated the value of agricultural and sideline production, and underestimated expenditures.

    There are many reasons for the false phenomena in the distribution trial calculation plans: some cadres did not proceed from reality and simply pursued excessively high targets. The Zhaidong Cooperative in Qingpu County calculated that it could not achieve increased income for more than 90% of its members, so it repeatedly revised the per-mu yield of rice four times, until more than 90% of its members would see increased income; some were because the mass line was not followed in the work method, and the estimates were made by a small number of people, resulting in excessively high figures; some plans were not high at the time, but later, due to natural disasters, the original targets could not be achieved.

    After discovering this problem, the Songjiang District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the county committees of Songjiang Special District successively convened meetings in mid-to-late September to deploy local areas to conduct supplementary lessons on autumn harvest distribution trial calculations and to correct them realistically. Since late September, the supplementary work on distribution trial calculations has been fully launched throughout the district. When conducting supplementary lessons on distribution trial calculations, agricultural cooperatives in various places have begun to check and correct unrealistic and false plans. At the end of September, the districts of Fengxian County convened meetings of agricultural cooperative directors, conducted education to unify the thinking of the cooperative cadres, and now have generally convened meetings of commune member representatives. Through summarizing achievements, they further mobilized commune members to put forward rationalization proposals for tapping potential to increase income and reduce expenditures. On this basis, they combined inspection and correction of the false parts of the plan. After responsible comrades of the Shanghai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party inspected the Yinghu Township and found that four cooperatives had overestimated income by 20,000 yuan, they immediately issued an urgent instruction to agricultural cooperatives in various places to revise the plans and correct the false phenomena. However, because the thinking of the cadres was not thoroughly reversed, the revised plans still had excessively high figures. After the inspection team of the District Committee inspected and pointed out this problem, further deployments were made to various places. When the Fourth Agricultural Cooperative of Xinying Township, Chuansha County, revised its plan, it fully promoted the spirit of democracy. The commune members put forward nine proposals for increasing production, such as picking cotton and harvesting late autumn crops, which could increase the harvest by 5,000 jin of cotton and 6,600 jin of miscellaneous grains. At the same time, household sideline occupations were vigorously developed and expenses were reduced. In this way, although the cotton quota of the whole cooperative was reduced, the total income increased by more than 4,000 yuan, and it could still strive for increased income for 94% of the commune members.

    When revising the distribution trial calculation plans, the leadership and education were strengthened for the cooperatives that were severely affected by disasters and could not truly achieve increased income for 90% of the members, striving for more harvest and less reduction. (Fan Wanjun)

    发动社员讨论秋收分配方案
    松江专区修正分配中的虚假现象
    本报讯　江苏省松江专区各地农业社普遍通过分配试算补课，修正分配试算方案中的虚假现象。
    前一时期，松江地区部分农业社在制定分配试算方案时，有的把农副业产值算高了，有的把支出算少了。
    分配试算方案产生虚假现象的原因很多：有的是干部不从实际出发，单纯追求过高指标。青浦县宅东社算算不能达到90％以上社员增加收入，就把水稻单产连改四次，直达到90％以上社员增加收入为止；有的是因为在工作方法上没有走群众路线，只是由少数人估算，也产生了偏高的现象；也有的是当时方案并不高，以后由于自然灾害的侵袭，原订指标不能完成了。
    中共松江地委和松江专区各县委检查发现这一问题后，已在9月中下旬先后召开会议部署各地在进行秋收分配试算补课时要实事求是的加以修正。从9月下旬开始，全区分配试算补课工作已全面展开，在进行分配试算补课时，各地农业社都已开始检查修正不切实际的虚假方案。奉贤县各区于9月底分别召开农业社长会议，进行教育后统一了社干思想，现普遍召开了社员代表会议，通过总结成绩，进一步发动社员提挖掘增加收入减少支出的合理化建议，在这基础上结合检查和修正了方案中的虚假部分。中共上海县委负责同志在莺湖乡检查发现四个社都多算了二万元收入以后，马上紧急指示各地农业社修订方案，纠正虚假现象，但是由于对干部思想没有彻底扭转，修正之后方案仍然存在偏高现象，经地委检查组检查指出这一问题后，又对各地作了部署。川沙县新营乡第四农业社修订方案时充分发扬了民主精神，社员提出拾棉花和收晚秋的九项增产建议，可多收五千斤棉花和六千六百斤杂粮。同时大力发展了家庭副业，降低开支，这样全社棉花指标虽然降低，但总收入却增加了四千多元，仍可争取94％的社员增加收入。
    各地在修正分配试算方案时，对受灾严重真正不能达到90％社员增加收入的社，都加强了领导和教育，力争多收和少减。（范万钧）
