Xinhua News Agency, October 15th. President Sukarno's radio address to the Chinese people at the invitation of the Central People's Broadcasting Station was broadcast to audiences nationwide tonight. The full text of the broadcast is as follows:
Brothers and sisters, all the people of the People's Republic of China:

I am now in Guangzhou, the largest city in southern People's Republic of China. Soon, my entourage and I will conclude our visit to the People's Republic of China and leave its territory. We have lived among the Chinese people for fourteen days as guests of the government and people of the People's Republic of China. To visit a country as large as yours, fourteen days is certainly not enough. However, these fourteen days have made us very happy. I say this for two reasons.

First, because we are visiting the People's Republic of China at an important moment. Why do I say it is an important moment? Because at this moment, China is in a period of transition; because at this moment, China has ended the old era, and can even be said to have buried it, buried the old era full of hardship, death, and tragic experiences, and at the same time, China has entered a new era, a new era with a bright future. The Chinese people are building a new society, a society where independence, justice, prosperity, and happiness are guaranteed.

Second, this visit to the People's Republic of China has made us very happy. Because in these fourteen days, we have not only been immersed in the beautiful Chinese scenery, rich and delicious banquets, and excellent Chinese art performances; but, most importantly, we have been constantly surrounded by the Chinese people. They are kind and hospitable, hardworking, and, more importantly, full of vitality, love independence, love peace, and cherish friendship.

These two reasons make this visit to the People's Republic of China an important one. This visit has made us very happy. We have visited many regions of the People's Republic of China, starting from Beijing, the seat of the central government, visiting the northern and central provinces, and finally the southern provinces. Wherever we went, we personally witnessed how the Chinese people are working hard, laboring diligently, and engaging in construction, construction, I repeat again, engaging in construction, building a new Chinese society. Based on everything we have seen, we can say: The Chinese people will surely achieve achievements worthy of pride in the future. Referring to some old traces that can still be seen now, we also clearly see that in the seven years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the people have continuously transformed China into a new society that brings infinite hope to the people. I firmly believe that new construction achievements will follow the existing achievements one after another. This belief of mine is based on two facts. First, the territory of the People's Republic of China is rich in various materials needed for construction. Second, and more important than material resources, is the people of the People's Republic of China. This is the most important wealth. Six hundred million people are united into a solid whole. They work diligently, are willing to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the country, they love independence, love peace, and cherish friendship. I know that some people are unhappy because China has made progress, they are jealous and even hate China. But I say, the People's Republic of China, rich in resources and with a population of six hundred million, has the characteristics I just mentioned; such a People's Republic of China will be able to forge ahead bravely, will be able to realize the ideals of its people, and build a new Chinese society. Such a People's Republic of China will not be destroyed; such a People's Republic of China cannot be eliminated; such a People's Republic of China will not perish; it will stand forever in the world. One day, the whole world will have to recognize the People's Republic of China. The existence of the People's Republic of China is an undeniable fact, a living fact. The People's Republic of China has the right to coexist with other nations and countries. In this regard, we pay attention to the Chinese youth. During these fourteen days, we had many opportunities to meet with Chinese young men and women and children. They greeted us with smiling faces and bright eyes. Based on what we have seen, we dare to say that the People's Republic of China can place its future hopes on the younger generation. We hope that the Chinese younger generation will continue to complete the great cause that the older generation has already begun. We also hope that the Chinese younger generation will continue to maintain and consolidate the bridge of friendship between the People's Republic of China and Indonesia that the older generation has now established. In this regard, we are confident that the young men and women of Indonesia will work together with the young men and women of China to succeed in the work of maintaining and consolidating the bridge of friendship.

Brothers and sisters, soon, we will leave the territory of the People's Republic of China and return to our motherland to carry out our work. We will continue to struggle to perfect our independence, build our national economy, and dedicate our strength to realizing peace between nations. You will also continue to complete your tasks. We believe that you will also continue to contribute your strength to realizing peace between nations. Let us continue to move forward, shoulder to shoulder, to achieve our common goal—to completely eliminate colonialism and imperialism from the lands of Asia and Africa, to further perfect our independence, and to achieve lasting world peace.

Finally, on behalf of the eighty-two million people of Indonesia, the Indonesian government, my entourage, and myself, I would like to express my gratitude to the six hundred million people of the People's Republic of China, the government of the People's Republic of China, and all the brothers and sisters who have made this visit a pleasant, beneficial, and unforgettable one. I wish all the people and leaders of the People's Republic of China eternal health, peace, and happiness.

Goodbye, brothers and sisters, I wish you victory in your struggle, thank you!

    苏加诺总统发表广播演说
    新华社15日讯　苏加诺总统应中央人民广播电台的邀请向中国人民发表的广播演说，今天晚上已经由中央人民广播电台向全国听众播送。广播的全文如下：兄弟姐妹们，中华人民共和国的全体人民：
    现在我正在中华人民共和国南方最大的城市广州。不久以后，我和我的随行人员将要结束我们在中华人民共和国的访问，离开中华人民共和国的国土。我们以中华人民共和国政府和人民的客人的身份在中国人民中间生活了十四天。要参观你们这么大的国家，十四天的功夫确实是不怎么够的。但是，这十四天已经使我们感到很幸福。我这么说是因为下面两个原因。
    首先是因为我们是在一个重要的时刻来到中华人民共和国访问。为什么说是一个重要的时刻呢？因为在这个时刻，中国正处在过渡时期；因为在这个时刻，中国结束了旧时代，甚至可以说是埋葬了旧时代，埋葬了充满困苦、死难和惨痛经历的旧时代，与此同时，中国进入了一个新时代，一个前途光辉灿烂的新时代，中国人民正在建设一个新社会，一个独立、公正、繁荣和幸福都有保障的社会。
    其次，这次访问中华人民共和国使我们感到非常幸福。因为在这十四天里，我们不但始终浸沉在秀丽的中国风景、丰盛甘美的宴会和优异的中国艺术演出里面；而且，最主要的是我们不断地给中国人民围绕着。他们善良好客、辛勤劳动、而且更重要的是，朝气勃勃、热爱独立、热爱和平、珍视友谊。
    这两个原因就使我们这次访问中华人民共和国成为一次重要的访问。这次访问使我们感到非常幸福。我们访问过中华人民共和国好些地区，我们从中央政府所在地北京出发，访问北方和中部各省，最后又访问南方省份。所经各地，我们到处都亲眼看到中国人民是怎样地努力工作，辛勤劳动，从事建设，建设，我再重复一次，从事建设，建设一个新的中国社会。就我们所看到的这一切，我们可以说：中国人民今后一定能够取得足以自豪的成就。我们参照现在还可以看得到的一些旧迹，也清楚地看到，七年来中华人民共和国的人民确实是不断地把中国改造成为一个给人民带来无限希望的新社会。我深深地相信，新的建设成绩一定会继目前已有的成绩接踵到来。我这种信念是根据两项事实得来的。第一，中华人民共和国的国土富有各种的进行建设所需要的物资。第二，也是比物质资料更重要的，那就是中华人民共和国的人民。这是最重要的财富。六亿人民团结成为一个牢固的整体。他们勤劳工作，甘愿为国家的利益而牺牲自己，他们热爱独立，热爱和平，也珍视友谊。我知道，有某些人因为中国获得进步而感到不快，他们妒忌甚至憎恨中国。但是，我说，资源丰富、拥有六亿人口的中华人民共和国具有我刚才说的那些特点；这样的中华人民共和国将能勇往直前，将能实现她的人民的理想，建立新的中国社会。这样的中华人民共和国是不会毁灭的；这样的中华人民共和国是消灭不了的；这样的中华人民共和国是不会灭亡的；它将永远屹立在世界上。总有一天，全世界都要承认中华人民共和国。中华人民共和国的存在是个无法否认的事实，是个活生生的事实。中华人民共和国有权同其他民族和国家共同生存。在这方面，我们对中国青年寄以注意。这十四天中，我们有许多机会同中国的青年男女和孩子们见面。他们带着微笑的面孔和发亮的眼睛和大家一道来迎接我们。根据我们看到的事实，我们敢说，中华人民共和国可以把未来的希望寄托在年青一代的身上。我们希望中国的年青一代能够继续去完成老一代已经开始了的伟大事业。我们还希望中国的年青一代以后能够继续维护并巩固老一代现在已经建立起来的中华人民共和国同印度尼西亚之间的友谊桥梁。在这点上，我们确信，印度尼西亚的青年男女是会和中国的青年男女共同在维护和巩固友谊桥梁的工作中获得成功。
    兄弟姐妹们，不久以后，我们就要离开中华人民共和国的国土，回到我们的祖国去进行我们的工作。我们将继续斗争，使我们的独立臻于完善，建设我们的国民经济，献出我们的力量来实现各国之间的和平。你们也将会继续去完成任务。我们相信，你们也将会继续贡献出你们的力量来实现各国之间的和平。让我们继续前进吧，并肩前进来实现我们共同的目标——把殖民主义和帝国主义从亚洲和非洲的土地上全部扫除干净，使我们的独立更臻完善，以实现持久的世界和平。
    最后，我代表八千二百万印度尼西亚人民、印度尼西亚政府、我的随行人员和我自己，向中华人民共和国的六亿人民、中华人民共和国政府以及一切使我们这次的访问成为一个令人愉快的、有益的和永远难于忘怀的访问的兄弟姐妹们，表示感谢。我祝中华人民共和国的全体人民和领导人永远健康、安乐和幸福。
    再见吧，兄弟姐妹们，祝你们斗争胜利，谢谢！
