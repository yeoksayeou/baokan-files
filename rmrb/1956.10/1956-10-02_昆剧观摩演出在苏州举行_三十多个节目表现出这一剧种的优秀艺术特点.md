Xinhua News Agency, Suzhou, 30th - The Kunqu Opera Performance and Observation, in which famous Kunqu Opera artists from the North and South participated, concluded in Suzhou on the 29th. The performance was originally scheduled for seven days, but was extended by one day due to the arrival of Bai Yunsheng and other famous Northern Kunqu Opera artists. A total of more than thirty programs were performed during this observation.

This performance fully demonstrated the excellent artistic characteristics of the Kunqu Opera genre and the mature performing skills of the Kunqu Opera actors. Xu Lingyun, who played Zhang Wenyuan in "Borrowing Tea," looked just like a romantic and dissolute playboy, but he himself was already an elderly man over seventy years old. The famous young male actor, Yu Zhenfei, played Li Bai in "Tai Bai's Drunken Writing," showing overflowing talent and romantic grace, perfectly expressing Li Bai's poet temperament of scorning the powerful. In the performance, the famous Dan (female) role actress of the Chuan generation, Zhang Chuanfang, played the graceful young nun in "Thinking of the Mortal World", Wang Chuansong played Xian Yu Ji, who bribed officials in the imperial examinations in "Dog Hole" to cheat and obtain the title of狀元 (Number One Scholar), Hua Chuanhao and Zhu Chuanming played a young couple who could not reunite due to the difficulties imposed by their mother-in-law in "Lu Lin". They all used meticulous and outstanding performances to create perfect images of their characters.

Representatives from most of the opera genres in the country attended this observation. These insiders, who were both actors and audience members, were very satisfied with this performance.

    昆剧观摩演出在苏州举行
    三十多个节目表现出这一剧种的优秀艺术特点
    据新华社苏州30日电　南北昆曲名家参加的昆剧观摩演出29日在苏州闭幕。观摩演出原定举行七天，临时因北方昆曲名家白云生等赶来参加，又延长了一天。这次观摩一共演出了三十多个节目。
    这次观摩演出充分表现了昆剧这一剧种的优秀的艺术特点和昆曲演员们的成熟的表演技巧。徐凌云饰演“借茶”中的张文远，活像一个风流浪荡的纨袴子弟，但他本人却已经是个七十岁开外的老年人了。著名小生俞振飞扮演“太白醉写”一剧中的李白，才情横溢，风流潇洒，完美地表现了李白蔑视权贵的诗人气质。在演出中，传字辈的著名旦角张传芳饰演“思凡”中婀娜多姿的青年尼姑，王传淞饰演“狗洞”一剧贿赂科场官吏骗取状元的鲜于佶，华传浩和朱传茗饰演“芦林”一剧受婆母刁难而不能团聚的一对青年夫妻，他们都用细致的出色的表演，很好地创造了角色的完美形象。
    观摩这次演出的，有全国绝大部分剧种派来的代表，这些既是演员又是观众的内行人士，都对这次演出非常满意。
