Remember the Lessons of Corn Yield Reduction in Quyang County
Wang Ping, Yuan Jiwu

The People's Daily published a brief report on August 28th, on page 3, written by Comrade Cui Xuming and others, concerning the reduction in corn yield in Quyang County due to over-dense planting. This issue is indeed very serious, and we feel it is necessary to explain it in more detail. This year, Quyang County planted a total of 103,000 mu of Baimaya corn. Except for 11,000 mu of irrigated land that can be harvested, 65,000 mu cannot increase production, and 27,000 mu have reduced production, of which 5,000 mu have no grain harvest at all. According to inspections, of the 27,891 mu of Baimaya corn planted in the Fourth District of Quyang, 11,500 mu had a 30% reduction in yield, and 1,500 mu have already been replanted. According to our on-the-spot inspection of a 53 mu cornfield in the Dengta Agricultural Cooperative, the density was 4,000 plants per mu. After thinning the seedlings twice, there were still 3,600 plants per mu. Due to the excessive density, empty plants accounted for 58%, and 3 mu have already been planted with buckwheat after being cleared. In the Eighth Production Team of the "May 1st" Agricultural Cooperative, a white cornfield had 2,870 plants per mu, but only 420 plants could be harvested. The remaining plants were all empty, accounting for 85.4% of the total. Township and cooperative cadres have been discussing the matter and are extremely dissatisfied with the leadership's practice of blindly promoting dense planting without considering local conditions.

Why did such serious losses occur? From the task assigned to Quyang County by the Baoding Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China for planting Baimaya corn, and the corn technical operation regulations formulated by the Baoding Prefectural Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, it can be seen that these tasks and regulations do not conform to the actual situation in Quyang County. Quyang County has more than 560,000 mu of cultivated land, most of which is thin and sandy soil, and has no habit of planting corn. However, the Baoding Prefectural Committee assigned the county the task of planting 240,000 mu of Baimaya corn. The Quyang County Committee proposed that the land was too thin to be suitable for planting and reduced the task to 170,000 mu. Later, they requested a further reduction to 140,000 mu. The County Committee still felt that they could not complete it. Liu Jinzhong, Deputy Secretary of the County Committee, personally asked Deputy Commissioner Li Sheng to reduce the task. Li replied: "This is a decision of the Prefectural Committee. You will have to figure out how to complete it yourselves." In order to complete the decision of the Prefectural Committee, the County Committee generally distributed the planting task of 140,000 mu to various townships and cooperatives. As a result, 103,000 mu were completed.

Looking at the corn technical operation regulations compiled by the Baoding Prefectural Agricultural and Forestry Bureau (drafted by Wang Yan, Deputy Chief of the Technical Section): corn should be densely planted with 4,000 to 5,000 seedlings per mu, and beans should be intercropped in 60% of the area. Deputy Director Sun Yushan did not review it and sent it to the leading comrades of the Prefecture. With the consent of the leading comrades of the Prefecture, it was printed into a handbook and distributed to all counties, townships, and cooperatives in the entire prefecture, ordering them to implement it accordingly. The Baoding Prefectural Women's Federation and the Communist Youth League also called on all young people and women in the entire prefecture to resolutely ensure its implementation. Li Yuenong, Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, instructed at the County Committee Secretary's meeting on January 14th: "Six measures, including accumulating fertilizer, dense planting, intercropping, changing old rural habits, technical reform, and basic land construction, are six revolutions." In this way, the leadership of Quyang County enforced the policy at each level, greatly fueling the coercive commandism of lower-level cadres. Hao Jingxi, Chief of the Technical Section of the Quyang County Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, declared the technical regulations formulated by the Prefecture as "quasi-legal." Failure to comply would be a violation of the law. Yang Hui, Township Instructor of Dongguo Township, told the masses in Dongdi Village: "Whoever does not implement these technical operation regulations and the six revolutions is a counter-revolutionary." Those who did not comply were treated as violations of discipline. Two party member cadres in the "May 1st" and "Dengta" Agricultural Cooperatives were disciplined for this reason, and some cooperative members had their work points deducted. For example, Zhang Gengchen, a Communist Party member of the "May 1st" Agricultural Cooperative, was expelled from the party for violating the operation regulations (later changed to probation within the party for two years). Tian Canggui, the captain of the Third Production Team of the "Dengta" Agricultural Cooperative, secretly planted 14 mu of Xiaohuang corn at the request of the cooperative members. When Township Instructor Yang Hui learned about this, he announced his expulsion from the party and dismissal from his position as captain (not executed). The County Committee also approved this as a typical case and circulated it throughout the county for public display. Most township and cooperative cadres and masses dared not speak out, and planted even land unsuitable for Baimaya corn according to the new technology, with 4,000 to 5,000 seedlings per mu. In early May, the Prefectural Committee realized that the corn seedlings were too dense and convened a meeting of county committee secretaries and county heads to report on the situation. They decided to thin the seedlings. The Prefectural Committee then issued three instructions on June 12th, June 20th, and July 6th to thin the seedlings. However, by this time, the seedlings had grown to six or seven feet tall and most had already tasseled. Township and cooperative cadres and masses could not bear to pull them out when they saw that the seedlings were dark, tall, and large. Some cooperative members reflected: "Our hands go soft when we pull the seedlings, and it really hurts to pull them!" Some who could not pull them used sickles to cut them off. Piles of corn stalks were heaped up on the edges of villages. Cooperative members sighed as they saw the mountains of corn stalks, saying: "A year's worth of sweat has been wasted. What kind of technical operation regulations are these? They are simply坑人 [trans. "screwing people over"]." Although the corn was thinned three times, the thinning was too late. The final thinning was done after the corn had tasseled, and the losses were still great. The 14 mu of Xiaohuang corn secretly planted by the Dengta Agricultural Cooperative has now been harvested, with an average yield of 340 jin per mu, and can still be planted with a season of buckwheat to harvest 100 jin. However, the Baimaya corn that can be harvested is only estimated to yield 200 jin.

We believe that the above problems are serious, and the Baoding Prefectural Committee and relevant departments should take this lesson to heart.

    记取曲阳县玉米减产的教训
    王平　袁继武
    8月28日人民日报第三版登载了崔旭明等同志写的曲阳县玉米由于种植过密减产的简单情况。这个问题确是很严重的，我们觉得有再比较详细地说明一下的必要。曲阳县今年共种白马牙玉米十万三千亩，除有一万一千亩浇园地能收外，有六万五千亩不能增产，有二万七千亩减产，其中有五千亩籽粒不收。据检查，曲阳四区种的二万七千八百九十一亩白马牙玉米，即有一万一千五百亩，减产30％；有一千五百亩已进行毁种。据我们实地检查灯塔农业社一块五十三亩的玉米地看，密度是每亩四千棵，已经两次拔苗，每亩还剩三千六百棵。由于过密，空棵即占58％，其中已有三亩拔掉种上了荞麦。“五一”农业社第八生产队一块白玉米地，每亩有二千八百七十棵，只有四百二十棵能有收成，其余均系空棵，没收成的占总数的85.4％。乡社干部纷纷议论，对领导上这种不因地制宜，盲目推广密植的干法极为不满。
    为什么会造成这样严重的损失呢？从中共保定地方委员会分配给曲阳县的种植白马牙玉米的任务以及保定专署农林局制定的玉米技术操作规程中可以看出，这些任务和规定是不符合曲阳县实际情况的。曲阳县共有耕地五十六万多亩，大部地薄，多黄沙土质，且无种植玉米习惯。中共保定地委却分配该县二十四万亩白马牙玉米种植任务。曲阳县委曾提出地薄不适宜种，才改为十七万亩，后来又请求减少，改为十四万亩。县委仍认为完不成，县委副书记刘进中曾亲自向李生副专员要求减少，李答复说：“这是地委决议，完不成由你们自己想办法。”县委为完成地委决议，就也一般化地将十四万亩的种植任务分配到各乡、社。结果，完成了十万三千亩。
    再看保定专署农林局编拟的玉米技术操作规程（由技术科副科长王岩编稿）：玉米密植每亩留苗四千棵至五千棵，要求在60％面积内间作豆类。副局长孙玉山也未审查即送专署领导同志，经专署领导同志同意，印成手册发到全专区各县乡、社，命令按照执行。保定专区妇联会和青年团也号召全专区青年、妇女坚决保证执行。地委书记李悦农同志在1月14日县委书记会议上指示：“积肥、密植、间作，改变农村旧习惯、技术改革、土地基本建设等六项措施是六项革命。”就这样，曲阳县领导上层层强制执行，大大助长了下层干部的强迫命令作风。曲阳县农林局技术股长郝景熙将专区制定的技术规程宣布为“半法律性”，如不执行就是犯法。东郭乡乡指导员杨会在东邸村向群众宣传说：“谁要不执行这个技术操作规程和六项革命，谁就是反革命。”遇有不执行者，则以违反纪律论处。“五一”“灯塔”两个农业社就有两个党员干部因此受到党纪处分，有些社员因此被扣除了工分。如“五一”农业社共产党员张耕臣以违反操作规程的罪名，被开除党籍（后改为留党察看二年处分），“灯塔”农业社第三生产队队长田仓贵在社员要求下私自种了十四亩小黄玉米，被乡指导员杨会知道宣布开除党籍、撤销其队长职务（未执行）。县委也批准以此为典型通报全县示众。大部分乡、社干部群众敢怒不敢言，把不适合种白马牙玉米的地也按新技术种上啦，每亩四千棵至五千棵苗。地委在5月初发觉玉米植株过密，召集各县县委书记、县长汇报会议，决定拔苗、疏苗；地委又先后在6月12日、6月20日、7月6日三次指示拔苗。但这时苗已长到六至七尺高，大部已吐穗，乡社干部群众看到苗黑高大，不忍拔掉。有些社员反映：“我们一拔苗手就软，拔的真心疼！”有些拔不动就用镰刀削，村村场边堆有大批玉米秸。社员们看到堆积如山的玉米秸就唉声叹气地说：“一年的汗白流了，这叫什么技术操作规程，纯粹是坑人。”当时玉米虽经三番五次地拔，因拔的太晚，最后拔时已吐穗，损失仍是很大。灯塔农业社偷种的十四亩小黄玉米现已收割，平均每亩产三百四十斤，还能种一季荞麦收一百斤；但种的白马牙玉米能收的才能估产二百斤。
    我们认为以上问题是严重的，保定地委及有关部门应该好好地记取这个教训。
