    Annoying Midnight Serenade
    Su Fang
    I live in a room facing the street. The room and the street are only separated by a wall, and I can hear all kinds of sounds from the street very clearly, especially in the quiet of the night. However, I am often troubled by some unexpected sounds! People who have not lived in this kind of street-facing house can hardly imagine these sounds. These sounds are various and diverse: sometimes a series of sharp laughter from young girls; sometimes the tenor singing of Peking Opera and Ping Opera such as "Fishing and Killing the Family" and "Liu Qiao'er"; or a group of people shouting and making noise...
    During the day, these sounds seem very ordinary and will certainly bring people a pleasant feeling; but at night, just when you are concentrating on thinking about something, or just when you are falling asleep, these sudden and unusually harsh sounds are really annoying.
    Perhaps these people would argue: you are annoyed, so be it, I have my freedom. But I think no one would agree with this statement. Because this kind of "freedom" that infringes on the freedom of others is actually just a licentious behavior that lacks social morality, "knowing only oneself, not knowing others." Because these night-traveling singers, laughers, and revelers, in the calm street and under the bright street lights, never think that in the surrounding houses, there are many people who have worked hard all day and are using sleep to restore their fatigue.

    惹人厌的夜半歌声
    苏方
    我住在一间临街的屋子里。屋子和街只有一墙之隔，街上发出的各种声音，我都听得很清楚；特别是在夜深人静的时候。但是，我常常为一些意外的音响所苦！这些音响，没有住过这种临街房子的人是很难想像得出来的。这些音响是各式各样，五花八门的：或者是一连串少女的尖俏的笑声；或者是唱着京剧，评剧如“打渔杀家”，“刘巧儿”等的男高音的歌声；或者是一群人的叫嚷和嘻闹的声音……。
    在白天，这些声音听起来是很平常的，而且一定还会带给人愉快的感觉；但是，在深夜，正当你在凝神谛思什么问题，或者正当你沉沉入睡的时候，这些突然袭来的显得异样刺耳的声音，就实在惹人厌恶了。
    或许这些人会这样辩解说：你厌烦就厌烦吧，我有我的自由。不过我想，任何人也不会同意这种说法的。因为这种侵犯了别人自由的“自由”，实际上不过是“只知有己，不知有人”的缺乏社会道德的放肆行为而已。因为这些夜游的歌者、笑者、嬉闹者在冷静的街上，明亮的路灯下欢快之际，是决不会想到他们身旁的这一片屋子里，还有许多紧张地工作了一天、正以睡眠来恢复自己的疲劳的人的。
