    In the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    Pigeon Fanciers' Club
    There are many pigeon fanciers in the Soviet Union, and raising pigeons has become a meaningful and noble sport. The Sixth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship will be held in Moscow next July and August. The members of the Communist Youth League in Moscow's Frunze District will release a large number of snow-white, lovely pigeons symbolizing peace during the festival. They also proposed to Moscow's pigeon fanciers to organize a pigeon fanciers' club. This club was officially established at a conference attended by 250 pigeon fanciers, and ten people were elected to form a management committee.
    The tasks of the pigeon fanciers' club are: to release a large number of white pigeons at the opening of international and national commemorative festivals; to organize pigeon exhibitions; to train pigeons collectively; to hold inter-district and inter-city competitions; to publish publications for exchanging experiences; to educate members and pigeon fanciers so that they do not disrupt public order (such as not tying stones or sticks to the pigeons' legs and not allowing the pigeons' whistles to be noisy, etc.). Moscow's pigeon fanciers decided to increase the number of pigeons in Moscow to between 20,000 and 30,000.
    Many enterprises, organizations, and trade unions in Moscow are actively preparing to participate in the Sixth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship to be held next year. They have allocated funds to build public pigeon houses, purchase pigeons, breed and train them. The Agricultural Books Publishing House will also publish a book entitled "Pigeon Breeding" by the end of this year.
        An Unusual Train
    Every month, an unusual train departs from Bucharest North Station to remote parts of the country. This is a medical train specially equipped by the Romanian government to develop the health care of urban and rural working people.
    This train has all the necessary medical facilities. In fact, it can be said to be a comprehensive hospital installed on wheels. Wherever it goes, the medical train begins to receive local sick railway workers. In the past two years, this medical train has traveled more than 20,000 kilometers across Romania, and even residents near very remote small stations are familiar with it.
    People who undergo general health check-ups on the medical train can simply walk through the carriages one by one and receive detailed examinations from the otolaryngology, internal medicine, and even X-ray departments. Finally, they can leave with an examination certificate signed by nine doctors on the train.
    Sometimes, railway workers also bring their family members to request medical treatment. The medical train also often provides medical assistance to rural residents along the railway line at their request. Only after all the work is completed does the train continue on its way.
      Nimble Hands
    Klara Marel is a typist for the "Hungarian National Daily." She has won the national typing championship sixteen times. Not long ago, she also won first place in the typing competition held in the People's Democratic countries. When her hands touch the keyboard of the typewriter, the keyboard emits a sound like a machine gun firing. Marel can type 215 syllables, or 543 letters, per minute on the typewriter according to the specified specifications.

    在苏联和人民民主国家
    养鸽爱好者俱乐部
    苏联有许许多多的养鸽爱好者，养鸽子已经成为一种有意义的、高尚的运动了。第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节将于明年七、八月间在莫斯科举行，莫斯科伏龙芝区的共青团员们要在联欢节放出大量的、象征和平的雪白可爱的鸽子。并向莫斯科的养鸽爱好者提议组织养鸽爱好者俱乐部。这个俱乐部在一次有二百五十个养鸽爱好者参加的大会上正式成立了，并且选出了十个人组成管理委员会。
    养鸽爱好者俱乐部的任务是：在国际的和民族的纪念节日开幕时放出大量的白鸽子；组织鸽子展览会；集体训练鸽子；举行区际和城际的比赛；出版交流经验的刊物；对会员和养鸽爱好者进行教育，使他们不破坏公共秩序（如不要在鸽子腿上绑上石头、棒子和不要让鸽子的哨声喧嚣等）。莫斯科的养鸽爱好者决定使莫斯科的鸽子达到两万到三万只。
    莫斯科许多企业、机关和工会组织积极准备参加明年举行的第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节，都拨出款子建立公共鸽舍，购买鸽子，加以繁殖和训练，农业书籍出版局还要在今年年底出版“养鸽学”一书。
        不寻常的列车
    在布加勒斯特北站每个月都有一列不寻常的火车出发到遥远的全国各地去。这是罗马尼亚政府为了发展城乡劳动人民的保健事业而特别装备起来的医疗列车。
    在这辆列车上，有着医疗上一切必要的设施。实际上它可以说是一座安装在车轮上的综合医院。每到一个地方，医疗列车便开始接纳当地患病的铁路工作人员。两年来，这辆医疗列车已在罗马尼亚全国各地行走了两万多公里，甚至极偏僻的小车站附近的居民也对它很熟悉了。
    在医疗列车上进行一般健康检查的人，只要在车厢里一节节地走过去，就可以顺序受到耳鼻喉科、内科直到爱克斯光科的详细检查。最后，他们就可以拿着经过列车上九个医师签字的检查证离开。
    有时，铁路工作人员也会带来他们的家属请求诊治。医疗列车也时常应铁路沿线农村居民的要求对他们进行医疗上的帮助。直到全部工作结束后，列车才又继续前进。
      灵　巧　的　手
    克拉拉·玛列尔是“匈牙利民族报”的打字员。她曾十六次获得全国打字冠军称号。不久以前，她在人民民主国家举办的打字比赛中也取得了第一位。当她的手触摸在打字机的键盘上的时候，键盘上就发出一种机枪射击似的声音。玛列尔按照指定的规格每一分钟可以在打字机上打出二百一十五个音节，五百四十三个字母。
