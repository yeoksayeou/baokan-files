According to the Sichuan Daily News: Under the current circumstances of insufficient materials, electricity, and transportation capacity, factories and mines in the Chongqing area are adopting methods such as mutual exchange and balanced adjustment within the city to ensure the rational utilization of existing materials and electricity. From October 10th to 12th, the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee held a meeting of responsible persons from more than one hundred factories, mines, and enterprises, conducting a mutual assessment for the first time. Currently, the quantity of production materials supplied in the Chongqing area cannot meet the production needs of various factories and mines. However, various units still retain some materials that they do not urgently need but are urgently needed by other units. This city-wide adjustment organized by the Municipal People's Committee has enabled many factories to transfer their surplus materials that are temporarily unused and to obtain the materials they need. Moreover, the scope of adjustment is wide, which has played a greater role in mutual support compared to past individual self-adjustments.

At the meeting, everyone signed 150 material exchange agreements based on the principles of "convenient consultation" and the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual benefit to jointly complete the state plan. They adjusted 516 tons of steel and other materials and 1,900 cubic meters of building materials, ensuring the supply of materials urgently needed by many units.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 18th: Ten machinery factories in Harbin City, including the state-owned Harbin No. 1 Tool Factory, have carried out material exchange work, greatly alleviating the difficulty of insufficient material supply.

In the third quarter, Songjiang Machinery Factory exchanged more than 100 tons of steel of various specifications with Harbin No. 1 Machinery Factory, Songjiang Electric Furnace Factory, Songjiang Hardware Factory, and factories in other places. Harbin Forest Machinery Factory lacked 30 tons of carbon structural steel for manufacturing winches, while Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, which lacked steelmaking scrap, had this type of steel. Harbin Forest Machinery Factory used 200 tons of scrap it had collected to exchange for the required carbon structural steel from Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Factory.

    重庆、哈尔滨采取平衡调剂的办法
    解决材料和电力供应不足的困难
    据四川日报讯　在目前物资、电力和运输力不足的情况下，重庆地区各厂矿企业采取全市范围内互通有无，平衡调剂等办法，使现有物资、电力等得到合理的利用。重庆市人民委员会在10月10日到12日召开了一百多个厂矿企业单位负责人会议，首次作了互相摸底工作。目前，重庆地区生产物资供应数量，是不能满足各厂矿生产需要的，但是各单位还保存着一些自己暂时不需要却为另一些单位迫切需要的物资。这次由市人民委员会出面组织的全市范围内的调剂，使许多厂把自己多余的暂时不用的物资调剂出来，又调进自己需要的物资。而且调剂面广，较之过去个别自行调剂更加发挥了互相支援的作用。
    会上，大家本着“两便协商”的原则，互助互利共同完成国家计划的精神，签订了物资交换协议书一百五十份，调剂钢材等物资达五百一十六吨，建筑材料一千九百立方公尺，使许多单位急需的物资得到了供应。
    据新华社哈尔滨18日电　哈尔滨市国营哈尔滨第一工具厂等十个机械工厂开展材料互换工作，大大减轻了材料供应不足的困难。
    松江机械厂在第三季度里，同哈尔滨市第一机械厂、松江电炉厂、松江五金厂以及外地工厂等共计互换了一百多吨各种不同规格的钢材。哈尔滨森林机械厂缺少三十吨制造绞盘机的炭素结构钢，而缺少炼钢废料的齐齐哈尔第一机床厂就有这种钢材。哈尔滨森林机械厂就以自己收集的两百吨废料，向齐齐哈尔第一机床厂换到了所需要的炭素结构钢。
