Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 25th: The Japanese delegation of six major metropolises, prefectures, counties, and cities left Guangzhou by train today to return home. Before their departure, the delegation expressed their impressions of their visit to China to Xinhua News Agency reporters.

The head of the delegation, Ando Shoichiro, expressed his gratitude for the warm reception they received in various parts of China. He said, "We are impressed to see such great development in all aspects of China's work since liberation. All of our delegation members unanimously praise the diligence of the Chinese people, and we admire the efforts of Chinese youth. We have seen Chinese leaders such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Peng Zhen, who, on the one hand, are concentrating their efforts on national construction, and on the other hand, are very humbly learning from other countries. This humble attitude is worthy of our learning."

Deputy head of the delegation, Terajima Rokuro, said that what impressed him most about China was that Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Peng Zhen all received them with a very friendly attitude. In particular, Chairman Mao Zedong shook hands with each of us and sent greetings to the Japanese people. I think this is the best gift we are taking back.

When talking about the development of China's industry, Terajima Rokuro said that when Chinese goods were exhibited in Japan last year, many people suspected that those high-quality products were not made in China, but perhaps in the Soviet Union. However, during this visit, we saw the actual situation of China's industrial development, which made us not only believe that those high-quality products were indeed made in China, but also believe that China's industry has great development prospects. He also said that China's sanitation work is very good, with very few flies and fleas, and the cities are clean.

Terajima Rokuro also said that Japan is eager to trade with China, and he saw that China also has the same desire. He said, "I am determined to strengthen efforts in this area, promote Sino-Japanese trade, and restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations."

Deputy head of the delegation, Kamei Kiyomaru, said that he had visited China before. He said that the China he sees today is very different from what he saw before. He expressed his belief that in five or ten years, China will definitely be a strong country. In his speech, he also expressed that he must work hard to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations after returning home.

    日本六大都、府、县、市访华代表团离广州回国
    对记者发表观感赞扬我国建设的成就
    新华社广州25日电　日本六大都、府、县、市访华代表团今天乘火车离开广州回国。代表团行前对新华社记者发表了访华观感。
    代表团团长安藤章一郎对在中国各地受到的热情款待表示感谢。他说，我们看到中国在解放后各方面的工作有这样大的发展而感到钦佩。我们全体团员都异口同声地赞扬中国人民的勤勉，对中国青年的努力我们表示佩服。我们看到中国的领导人毛泽东、周恩来、彭真等，他们一方面在集中精力努力建设国家，另方面他们又非常谦虚地向其他国家学习，这种谦虚的态度是值得我们学习的。
    副团长寺岛录三郎说，对中国印象最深的，是毛泽东、周恩来、彭真都以非常友好的态度热情地接待我们。特别是毛泽东主席，和我们每人都握手，向日本国民问好，我认为这是我们带回去的最好的礼物。
    在谈到关于中国工业发展问题的时候，寺岛录三郎说，去年中国商品在日本展览的时候，许多人都怀疑那些质量优良的产品不是中国造的，也许是苏联造的。但是，在这次访问中，我们看到了中国工业发展的实际情况，使我们不但相信了那些质量优良的产品确实是中国制造的，而且还相信中国的工业有很大的发展前途。他又说，中国的卫生工作搞得很好，苍蝇、跳蚤很少，城市清洁。
    寺岛录三郎还说，日本方面热望和中国进行贸易，他看到中国也有同样的愿望。他说，我有决心加强这方面的努力，促进中日贸易，恢复中日邦交。
    副团长龟井喜代丸说，他以前曾来中国访问过。他所看到的今天的中国和以前比起来有很大的变化。他表示相信不出五年十年，中国一定是个国力强大的国家。他在谈话中还表示回去后一定要为恢复中日邦交而努力。
