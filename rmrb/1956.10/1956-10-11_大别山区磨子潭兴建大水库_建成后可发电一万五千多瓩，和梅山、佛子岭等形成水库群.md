According to the Anhui Daily: The Mozitan Reservoir on the eastern source of the Pi River in Anhui has officially commenced full-scale construction. On September 22nd, a grand commencement ceremony was held at the reservoir construction site. When Zhao Jiabao, the commander of the reservoir project headquarters, issued the commencement order, the whistles of the bulldozers sounded loudly, and the roar of various machine motors was deafening. Soon, another modern giant valley reservoir will appear in the Dabie Mountains.

The Mozitan Reservoir is being built in a canyon near Mozitan Town, Huoshan County, only twenty-five kilometers downstream from the Foziling Reservoir arch dam. The reservoir includes three key projects: building a hollow gravity dam (with a section of gravity dam at each end) that is 340 meters long, 79.5 meters high, and composed of fourteen dam piers, which is higher than the already built Foziling Reservoir arch dam and Meishan Reservoir arch dam, and the engineering task is also greater; excavating a drainage tunnel with a diameter of 7.8 meters and a length of 285 meters on the left bank of the dam; and excavating a spillway in the mountain depression on the left bank of the dam body. The materials required for the entire project include more than 300,000 cubic meters of concrete alone, the estimated stone volume is over 150,000 cubic meters, and tens of thousands of tons of steel, wood, and other materials are also needed.

After the reservoir is completed, it will block the river water汇集ed from the Dongliu River and the Taiyang River, forming a reservoir lake with a capacity of over 280 million cubic meters. The floodwater stored will be used to generate over 15,000 kilowatts of electricity. Together with the already built Foziling Reservoir, Meishan Reservoir, and the Xianghongdian Reservoir under construction, as well as the Lianghekou Reservoir to be built, it will form a "V" shaped reservoir group, which can not only completely control the floods of the east and west Pi Rivers, fundamentally eliminate the flood disasters of the Pi River and Shi River, the two major tributaries of the Huai River, but also greatly reduce the flood control burden of the main stream of the Huai River, ensure bumper harvests of crops on both sides of the river, and develop industrial and agricultural production.

The Mozitan Reservoir will adopt the advanced construction experience of the Foziling Reservoir, Meishan Reservoir, and other projects, so it will be able to block floods by June 1957 and be fully completed in 1958.

Currently, the construction team workers have built the first batch of 3,000 workers' dormitories on the newly cleared hillside; the drill team workers have opened up the road from Foziling to Mozitan; and the electricians are erecting high-voltage power lines to bring the current from the Foziling Hydropower Station to Mozitan. Large trucks loaded with equipment are continuously transporting construction materials to the construction site. A busy and intense construction scene is unfolding at the Mozitan construction site.

    大别山区磨子潭兴建大水库
    建成后可发电一万五千多瓩，和梅山、佛子岭等形成水库群
    据安徽日报讯　安徽淠河东源的磨子潭水库已正式全面开工兴建。9月22日，水库工区举行了盛大的开工大会，当水库工程指挥部指挥赵家保发布了开工命令后，开山机的汽笛长鸣，各种机器马达的轰鸣声震耳欲聋。不久，大别山区又将出现一座现代化的巨型山谷水库。
    磨子潭水库建筑在霍山县磨子潭镇附近的峡谷中，下行离佛子岭水库连拱坝只有二十五公里。水库包括三大关键工程：建筑一座长三百四十公尺、高七十九点五公尺、由十四个坝垛组成的空心重力坝（两端各接有一段重力坝），比已建成的佛子岭水库连拱坝、梅山水库连拱坝都高，工程任务也大；在坝的左岸开凿一道直径七点八公尺、长二百八十五公尺的泄水隧洞；在坝身左岸的山凹里还要开挖一条溢洪道。全部工程所需要的器材，仅混凝土就要三十多万公方，石方任务估计在十五万公方以上，还需要数以万吨计的钢材、木料等。
    这座水库建成后，将挡住由东流河、太阳河汇集来的河水，形成一个能容纳二亿八千多万立方公尺的贮水湖，所拦蓄的洪水利用后能发电一万五千多瓩。它与已经建成的佛子岭水库、梅山水库和正在兴建的响洪甸水库以及将要兴建的两河口水库，组成一个“V”字形的水库群，不仅可全部控制东西两条淠河的洪水，从根本上消除淠河、史河两大淮河支流的洪水灾害，而且对减轻淮河干流的防洪负担、保证两岸农作物丰收、发展工农业生产都有很大作用。
    磨子潭水库将采用佛子岭水库、梅山水库以及其它工程的先进的施工经验，所以到1957年6月就能拦洪，1958年就可以全部完工。
    目前，修建队工人已在新伐掉杂树的山腰上盖好了第一批三千间工人宿舍；机钻队工人已打通了从佛子岭到磨子潭的公路；电工们正在架设高压电线准备把佛子岭水电站的电流引到磨子潭。满载着器材的大卡车正源源不断地把建筑器材向工地运送。磨子潭工地上呈现出一片繁忙紧张的施工景象。
