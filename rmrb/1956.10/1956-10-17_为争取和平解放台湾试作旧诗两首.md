Writing old-style poetry to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers is not easy; the completion of a single poem requires a lot of meticulous effort, so many people have stopped writing in this style since Liberation.

Recently, the Central Government has repeatedly called for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Some have suggested using various methods to persuade Taiwan, and have also proposed asking overseas Chinese Kuomintang members and other patriotic elements to jointly urge Taiwan to respond to the Central Government's call. These "various methods" certainly include writing old-style poetry.

Therefore, I believe that old-style poetry also has a place to serve. In the spirit of "Let a hundred flowers bloom," it can be considered one of the flowers. Unable to resist the urge, I have written two heptasyllabic poems.

    I
    Encouraging Military and Political Personnel in Taiwan to Respond to the Call and Strive for the Peaceful Liberation of Taiwan

    Raising the flag within the country issues a grand summons,
    Do not rely on heaven and arrogance, you tiny island!
    Eight thousand exhausted soldiers long to return to the Han;
    Ten thousand stubborn resisters are ashamed to serve the Liao.
    Flesh can be bared to receive lashes, thorns can be borne on the back;
    The time is not late, the road is not far:
    If you gentlemen can be like Lian Po,
    Your selfless patriotism will dispel all suspicion.

    II
    Calling on Overseas Chinese, Kuomintang Members, and Other Patriotic Elements to Jointly Urge the Taiwan Authorities to Return to the Motherland as Soon as Possible, with an Introduction

       Mr. Chen Jiageng, a leader among overseas Chinese, once said,
       "Overseas Chinese all love their country and their hometown, and so do Kuomintang members." I once resided in the Philippines, and traveled extensively in Bangkok, Singapore, and Malaya, coming into contact with overseas Chinese Kuomintang members and other individuals. I deeply appreciate Mr. Chen's words. I write this poem hoping that they will jointly express their patriotic and hometown-loving zeal, and work together to urge the Taiwan authorities to return to the motherland as soon as possible, to jointly build the motherland and ensure the peace of our ancestors' graves.

    The sun and moon shine brightly, the universe is clear,
    A hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend.
    The golden goblet is so beautiful, yet one corner is still missing,
    The paper tiger is decaying, yet its claws still clutch.
    Can the motherland's rivers and mountains tolerate cession?
    The fish and birds of our homeland await peace and prosperity.
    If you can teach them to return to the fold soon,
    Extraordinary merit and fame will celebrate the accomplishment!

    为争取和平解放台湾试作旧诗两首
    吴研因
    旧诗不易为工农兵服务；一诗之成，又要费上不少推敲的心血，所以在解放之后，许多人都不弹此调了。
    最近，中央一再号召和平解放台湾。有人提议应用各种方式向台湾说服，还提议要求海外华侨国民党人和其他爱国分子联合劝请台湾响应中央号召，所谓各种方式，当然连写旧诗在内。
    因此，我认为旧诗也有了服务之地。在“百花齐放”中也可以算是一花了，不觉技痒起来，写成了七律两首。
    一
    勖台湾军政人员响应号召争取和平解放台湾
    海内扬旗赋大招，
    弹丸莫更恃天骄！
    八千疲顿思归汉；
    十万横摩耻事辽。
    肉可袒呈荆可负；
    时非穷暮路非遥：
    诸君但得如廉颇，
    爱国无私嫌自消。
    二
    号召海外华侨国民党人暨其他爱国分子合力劝请台湾当道早日率土来归并引
       侨领陈嘉庚先生尝言
       “海外华侨莫不爱国爱乡，即国民党人亦然”。余曾侨居菲律滨，漫游曼谷、新加坡、马来亚各地，与华侨国民党人暨其他人士相接触，深然陈先生之说。作此诗，冀其共抒爱国爱乡热忱，合力劝请台湾当道早日率土来归，以共建祖国，安祖宗庐墓也。
    日月光华宇宙清，
    百花齐放百家鸣。
    金瓯大好隅犹缺，
    纸虎雕零爪尚擎。
    祖国河山容割让？
    故乡鱼鸟待升平。
    能教率土归宗早，
    不次功名庆玉成！
