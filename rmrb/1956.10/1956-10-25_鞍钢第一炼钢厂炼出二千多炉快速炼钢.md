    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Anshan Iron and Steel Company's First Steel Plant workers, learning from the Soviet Union's outstanding steelmaker Kolesnikov's experience in fast steelmaking, have produced a total of more than two thousand three hundred heats of fast steel in the past year, reducing the time to make each heat of steel by more than one hour compared to the past. The steel produced in the past year due to the fast steelmaking competition is enough to build several huge factory buildings like large rolling mills.
    As a result of carrying out the fast steelmaking competition, Anshan Iron and Steel's First Steel Plant has increased its steel production significantly this year compared to last year. The No. 1 open-hearth furnace alone has produced more than 35,000 tons of steel in the first nine months of this year than in the same period last year.

    鞍钢第一炼钢厂炼出二千多炉快速炼钢
    据新华社讯　鞍山钢铁公司第一炼钢厂职工学习苏联优秀炼钢工科列斯尼科夫快速炼钢的经验，一年来共炼出了二千三百多炉快速炼钢，使每炼一炉钢的时间比过去缩短一个钟头以上。一年来由于开展快速炼钢竞赛所增产的钢，足可建筑好几座像大型轧钢厂一样的巨型厂房。
    由于开展快速炼钢竞赛，今年鞍钢第一炼钢厂比去年增产了大批的钢，仅一号平炉今年9个多月来就比去年同期增产了三万五千多吨钢。
