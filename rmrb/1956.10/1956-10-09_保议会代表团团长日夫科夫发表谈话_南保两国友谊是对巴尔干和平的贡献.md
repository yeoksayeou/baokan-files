Xinhua News Agency, 8th. According to the Yugoslav News Agency, the head of the Bulgarian National Assembly delegation, Zhivkov, said in Belgrade on the evening of the 7th that the friendship between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia is determined by the nature of the socialist order that the two countries are establishing, which constitutes the foundation for further consolidating and developing the friendly relations between the two countries.

　　Zhivkov said at a press conference that during the Bulgarian delegation's visit to Yugoslavia, people everywhere expressed their desire for the establishment of solid friendly relations and the hope that friendly relations would never be interrupted again. Zhivkov pointed out that the consolidation of friendship between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria is also an important contribution to the consolidation of peace in the Balkans.

　　When talking about socialist construction, Zhivkov said that there are differences in the methods and practices of socialist construction. It is natural that some of the methods used by Yugoslavia for socialist transformation are different from those used by Bulgaria. In the various specific methods of building a new life, every socialist country and every communist party can learn something from the experience of another socialist country and another communist party and utilize it.

　　保议会代表团团长日夫科夫发表谈话
    南保两国友谊是对巴尔干和平的贡献
    据新华社8日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社报道，保加利亚国民议会代表团团长日夫科夫7日傍晚在贝尔格莱德说，保加利亚和南斯拉夫之间的友谊是由两国正在建立的社会主义秩序的性质所决定的，这就构成进一步巩固和发展两国之间的友好关系的基础。
    日夫科夫在记者招待会上说，保加利亚代表团人员在访问南斯拉夫期间，到处看到人们所表示的要求建立巩固的友好关系和希望友好关系永远不会再中断的愿望。日夫科夫指出，南斯拉夫和保加利亚的友谊的巩固也是对巩固巴尔干的和平的一个重要贡献。
    日夫科夫在谈到社会主义建设的时候说，在社会主义建设的方式和实践方面存在着不同，南斯拉夫实行社会主义改造的某些方式和保加利亚的方式不同，这是很自然的事情。在建设新生活的各种不同的具体方法上，每一个社会主义国家和每一个共产党都可以从另一个社会主义国家和另一个共产党的经验中学到一些东西，并且加以利用。
