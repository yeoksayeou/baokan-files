Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 27th -- According to a broadcast from Budapest Radio: The riots that began in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, on the evening of October 23rd have not yet subsided. A large number of rioters laid down their weapons on the 26th. However, some elements have incited more fighting. Martial law is still in effect throughout the city.

In Borsod Province in northeastern Hungary, as well as in some areas of the south and west, rioters are still active. Due to incomplete restoration of telecommunications, detailed information about these areas cannot yet be determined.

On the morning of the 26th, the Hungarian government ordered government troops to launch a general offensive, while calling on the rebels to cease resistance or lay down their arms before 10:00 PM that day. The Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic later issued an order deciding to grant amnesty to all thugs who lay down their arms within the time limit prescribed by the government. The "Budapest Security Forces Command" also issued an appeal to the thugs to stop resisting and bloodshed.

On the evening of that day (the 26th), in several districts of Budapest, a large number of armed thugs surrendered. According to the decision of the Party and the government to treat surrendered rebels humanely, all those who surrendered were released after handing over their weapons.

In a statement on October 26th, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party announced that thousands of people had been killed or wounded in Budapest during the riots.

The Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party held a meeting on the afternoon of the 26th. In a statement, the meeting called for an end to armed action and a return to calm and normal work. The statement said that the Central Committee had recommended that the Presidium of the National Council of the Patriotic People's Front propose to the Presidium of the Republic the appointment of a new government personnel with the broadest national base. The new government will use its infinite power to create an independent, free, democratic, and socialist state. The statement pointed out that the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the government firmly stand on the position of socialist democracy, are determined to defend the achievements of the people's democratic regime, and will not give up the cause of socialism. The statement called on members of the Hungarian Working People's Party, the Hungarian working people, especially workers, armed forces, and former guerrilla fighters, to mercilessly eliminate those who have launched an attack on the people's regime and have not laid down their arms within the specified time limit.

On the same day, the Presidium of the National Council of the Hungarian Patriotic People's Front also called on the people of Budapest and the whole country to assist the government in restoring order and tranquility. The message to the people said: "This is the most important condition for implementing the government's program," "Continuing to cause trouble and march is not in the national interest."

"Free People's Daily," the organ of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, which had been damaged by thugs but resumed publication on the 26th, also published an editorial that day calling for an end to the bloody fighting.

    匈政府限令叛乱者停止抵抗
    已有大批暴乱者放下了武器
    新华社布拉格27日电　据布达佩斯电台广播：10月23日晚间在匈牙利首都布达佩斯开始的暴乱尚未平息。大批暴乱者在26日放下了武器。但是，另有一些分子挑起了更多的战斗。全市仍实施戒严。
    在匈牙利东北的包尔绍德省以及南部和西部的一些地区，暴乱者还在进行活动。由于电讯联系尚未全部恢复，这些地区的详细情况还不能判明。
    匈牙利政府在26日上午命令政府军队发起总攻击，同时号召叛乱者在当天下午十时以前停止抵抗或者放下武器。匈牙利人民共和国主席团后来又发布命令，决定对一切在政府规定的期限以内放下武器的暴徒予以赦免。布达佩斯“保安部队司令部”也向暴徒发出了停止抵抗和流血的呼吁。
    当天（26日）晚上，在布达佩斯几个区内，大批武装暴徒投降。根据党和政府关于要人道地对待投降的叛乱分子的决定，所有投降者在交械以后都被释放。
    劳动人民党中央委员会在10月26日的一份公告中宣布，在这次暴乱中，布达佩斯已经伤亡了成千人。
    匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会在26日下午举行了会议。会议在一份公告中呼吁结束武装行动，恢复平静和正常工作。公告说，中央委员会已经建议爱国人民阵线全国委员会主席团向共和国主席团提出任命一个有最广泛的全国基础的新政府人员的建议，新政府将以它所拥有的无穷无尽的力量创立一个独立、自由、民主和社会主义的国家。公告指出，匈牙利劳动人民党中央和政府坚决地站在社会主义民主的立场上，决心要保卫人民民主政权的成就，并且不放弃社会主义事业。公告号召劳动人民党党员、匈牙利劳动人民，特别是工人、武装部队和前游击队队员无情地消灭那些对人民政权发动进攻而在限定期限内没有放下武器的人。
    匈牙利爱国人民阵线全国委员会主席团在同一天也号召布达佩斯和全国人民协助政府恢复秩序和安宁。告人民书说：“这是实行政府纲领的最重要的条件”，“继续肇事和游行是不符合民族利益的”。
    曾经遭到暴徒破坏而在26日复刊的匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会机关报“自由人民报”当天也发表了社论，呼吁停止流血的战斗。
