　　Moscow, October 20th – At 10 a.m. on the 20th, Soviet leaders and ambassadors of various countries to the Soviet Union saw Ichiro Hatoyama off at Moscow Central Airport. This was a completely different situation from when Ichiro Hatoyama arrived in Moscow eight days ago. In these few days, a historically significant change has taken place in Soviet-Japanese relations. In the words of Bulganin, "From the time the Joint Declaration was signed, diplomatic and consular relations between the Soviet Union and Japan have been restored."

　　Soviet-Japanese negotiations were held with rapid progress. A total of one plenary meeting of the two delegations was held to instruct the plenipotentiary representatives of both sides to draft and review documents. The plenipotentiary representatives of both sides, Gromyko and Shunichi Matsumoto, held three talks before reaching a complete agreement. This clearly illustrates that as long as there is a sincere desire and a spirit of consultation, and one acts independently from a practical standpoint, it is not too difficult to reach an agreement to establish normal relations with a neighboring country.

　　Of course, this is not to say that there were no differences of opinion and points of contention during the talks. Since the two countries have different systems, it would be strange if there were no differences of opinion when discussing the relations between the two countries. However, in this negotiation, especially in the discussion of drafting and passing documents by the plenipotentiary representatives of both sides, the different opinions were all put on the table for discussion, and the difficulties were overcome through consultation. The reporter learned that the overcoming of these difficulties was the result of the efforts of both sides. It should be pointed out that some concessions made by the Soviet side played a certain role in reaching the agreement.

　　The Soviet-Japanese trade agreement signed this time has a significant meaning for the development of economic and trade relations between the two countries. There is news that Japanese business people are very interested in the Soviet proposal to reach a trade volume of at least 1 billion rubles per year (500 million rubles per side) in the next five years. According to people in Moscow who understand the Japanese economy, Japan's export volume is still far from its pre-war level. For example, last year Japan's export volume was only a little more than half of its pre-war export level. It should be noted that Japan is a country that relies on exports for its livelihood. Seventy percent of its shipbuilding industry's products, thirty percent of its textile industry's products, and many other industrial sectors are produced for export. The shrinking of export volume cannot but force many economic sectors to reduce production. This person who understands the situation also said that Soviet-Japanese trade has had a traditional and enviable record in history. Soviet-Japanese trade began in the 1930s, and before World War II, it had been developing forward on a mutually beneficial basis. In the past, the Soviet Union exported to Japan raw materials and equipment urgently needed by the Japanese economy, such as timber, oil, fish products, and various machines, while Japan exported to the Soviet Union its traditional export goods, such as machines, ships, rigging, and other commodities. The compelling situation is an important reason why Japanese public opinion demands the restoration of normal Soviet-Japanese relations.

　　Although Ichiro Hatoyama only stayed in Moscow for a short nine days, he still visited some places in Moscow according to his wishes.

　　He visited the Kremlin and praised the exhibits in the Armory. He visited Moscow University on Lenin Hills, and he was not only surprised by the magnificent appearance of the buildings, but also admired the perfection of the teaching system. He also enjoyed the ballet "Swan Lake" at the Grand Theater. Therefore, Ichiro Hatoyama once said, "I hope that cultural exchanges between the Soviet Union and Japan can help consolidate world peace and promote human prosperity." Indeed, it is ultimately impossible to artificially separate two neighboring countries with cultural ties and separated by water.

　　The end of the state of war and the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union are the trend of the times, the result of the Soviet government's adherence to the policy of negotiation and consultation, and the product of the Japanese people's efforts to establish friendly and good-neighborly relations with neighboring countries. Facts have proved that the will of the people is the most powerful.

    瓜熟蒂落
    本报驻苏联记者　胡思升
    20日上午10时，苏联领导人员和各国驻苏使节在莫斯科中央机场欢送鸠山一郎离开莫斯科。这同八天前鸠山一郎来到莫斯科时有了截然不同的情况。在这几天里，日苏关系发生了有历史意义的变化，用布尔加宁的话来说，就是：“从签订联合宣言的时候起，苏联和日本的外交和领事关系恢复了。”
    苏日谈判是在进展迅速的情况下举行的。总共举行过一次双方代表团全体会议，就指令双方全权代表草拟和审查文件。双方全权代表葛罗米柯和松本俊一前后进行了三次会谈，就完全达成了协议。这很好地说明，只要有真诚的愿望和协商的精神，从实际出发而又能独立行事，像达成同邻国建立正常关系这样的协议是并不太困难的。
    当然，这并不是说，在会谈中双方没有不同的意见和争执的所在。既然两个国家制度不同，讨论两国的关系问题，没有不同的意见才是令人奇怪的事。但是在这次商谈中，尤其是在双方全权代表草拟和通过文件的讨论中，把不同的意见都放到桌面上来谈，经过磋商，就克服了困难。记者了解到，这些困难的克服是双方努力的结果。应该指出，苏联方面作的一些让步在达成协议中起了一定的作用。
    这次签订的苏日贸易议定书对两国经济贸易关系的发展有着不小的意义。有这样的消息，日本贸易界人士对苏联方面这样的建议很感兴趣，这就是在最近五年中双方的贸易额达到每年至少十亿卢布（每方五亿卢布）的数目。据莫斯科了解日本经济情况的人说：现在日本的出口额距战前的水平还很远，例如去年日本的出口额只达战前出口水平的一半多一点，这里应当估计到日本是靠出口为生的国家，它的造船业的百分之七十的产品，纺织业的百分之三十的产品以及其他许多工业部门都是为出口而生产的。出口额的萎缩不能不迫使许多经济部门减少生产。这位了解情况的人还说，日苏贸易在历史上是有过传统的和令人羡慕的纪录的。日苏贸易在二十世纪三十年代就开始了，到第二次大战以前，一直是在互利的情况下向前发展。过去，苏联输往日本的都是日本经济急需的原料和装备，像木材、石油、鱼产品和多种机器，而日本输往苏联的也是日本的传统出口物资，像机器、船只、索具和其他商品等。形势逼人，这是日本舆论要求恢复苏日正常关系的一个重要的原因。
    鸠山一郎在莫斯科虽然只停留了短短的九天，根据他的愿望，还是参观了莫斯科的一些地方。
    他参观了克里姆林宫，对兵器库的陈列品加以赞扬。他访问了列宁山上的莫斯科大学，他不仅对建筑物的雄伟外貌感到惊讶，而且佩服教学制度的完善。他并在大戏院欣赏了芭蕾舞剧“天鹅湖”。因此，有一次鸠山一郎说，“我愿望，苏日两国间的文化交流能有助于世界和平的巩固和人类的繁荣。”的确，要把两个隔水相望的有文化联系传统的邻国人为地隔离开来，终究是不可能的。
    日苏结束战争状态和建立正常外交关系是时代潮流之所趋，是苏联政府坚持谈判和协商政策的结果，是日本人民争取同邻国建立友好睦邻关系的努力的产物。事实证明，人民的意志是最有力量的。
