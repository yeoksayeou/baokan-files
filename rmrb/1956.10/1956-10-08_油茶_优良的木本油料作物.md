Oil Tea—An Excellent Woody Oil Crop
Xie Yuanxiao

Oil tea is a woody oil crop with high economic value. Tea oil is not only a high-quality edible oil, but also can be used as machine lubricating oil, hair oil, and to manufacture soap, artificial cream, and mixtures for agricultural insecticides. Tea seed cake can also be used as fertilizer. Oil tea is mainly distributed in southern provinces, with Hunan having the largest planting area; 83 out of the province's 86 counties grow oil tea forests.

Oil tea is suitable for growing in temperate zones at altitudes within 500 meters, on mountains with deep soil layers and sufficient sunlight. Because oil tea does not compete with grain and cotton for land, the production of this oil crop has great potential for development. In Zhejiang, oil tea forests accounted for 44.3% of the total afforestation area this spring. Hunan planted 1.62 million mu of oil tea forests this spring and plans to expand planting by 4.32 million mu this winter and next spring. It is estimated that the total area of newly planted oil tea forests nationwide this year will approach 10 million mu, equivalent to 50% of the total area of existing oil tea forests before liberation.

Oil tea has high yields and a long fruit-bearing period. If managed well, with annual mountain cultivation and attention to fertilization, mature oil tea forests can produce over 100 jin of oil per mu. In Huangpo Township, Taoyuan County, Hunan, the 52 oil tea trees on the six fen of land belonging to poor peasant Yuan Qilao can yield 47-48 jin of oil in a small year and around 95 jin in a large year. Generally, each mu can produce 40-50 jin of oil, which is about twice as high as the oil yield per unit area of rapeseed. With careful cultivation, normal oil tea trees can bear fruit continuously for more than 80 years. Moreover, when they approach the aging period, they can be rejuvenated by coppicing: cutting the trunk flush with the ground, allowing it to sprout new branches and leaves, and it will begin to bear fruit again after three years and gradually enter the peak production period.

Oil tea generally starts bearing fruit six years after planting. In recent years, the masses have created a cutting propagation method, which allows oil tea to bear fruit three years earlier and increases yields.

Oil tea is mainly divided into two types: white-flowered oil tea and red-flowered oil tea. There are many varieties of white-flowered oil tea: Hunan's "Hanlu Zi," Jiangxi's "Guanyin Tao," Guangxi's "Yangshi Cha," Fujian's "Cha Tao," and Guizhou's "Xiaoban Youcha" are all excellent varieties with early maturity, high yields, and sufficient oil content.

Red-flowered oil tea is a wild tree species recently discovered in Guangning, Fengchuan in Guangdong and Kaihua counties in Zhejiang. It blooms red flowers in early spring, which are very beautiful. The fruits mature in autumn and are as large as oranges. Although the pericarp is thick and the fruiting period is later, the yield is several times higher than that of white-flowered oil tea. Therefore, everyone has begun to pay attention to the development of red-flowered oil tea.

Managing oil tea is a major production activity for the people in the mountainous areas of southern China. Qingtian County in Zhejiang Province is known as the "Oil Depot of Southern Zhejiang." In Zhangcun District of this county, the annual income from oil tea is equal to more than 70% of the total income from paddy fields in the district. Therefore, the saying "eat tea trees, wear tea trees, use tea trees" is prevalent in these key production areas.

Currently, half of the old oil tea forests nationwide are still in a state of neglect, and the yields are very low. The average yield of tea oil per mu in Guangxi is 14.7 jin, in Zhejiang it is 12.8 jin, in Hunan it is only 10 jin, and in Jiangxi, Guizhou, and other provinces, the yield is even lower, only about 6 jin. It is estimated that the oil yield per unit area of oil tea nationwide does not exceed 12 jin. The production potential of oil tea has not been fully realized.

The main technical measures to increase oil tea production are timely mountain cultivation. Generally, neglected oil tea forests can increase yields several times or even dozens of times by mastering the rule of "major cultivation every three years, minor cultivation every year," or "cultivation every other year for three years." Before liberation, Ouyang Fu of Nanlong Township, Ji'an County, Jiangxi, could only pick one basket of tea fruit from his one mu of neglected tea mountain each year because he could not afford to cultivate it. After cultivating the mountain once in 1951, he picked twelve baskets of tea fruit in 1954. If all localities strive to reclaim all existing neglected oil tea forests this year and strengthen the management of oil tea forests, the production can be increased by three times in two or three years, which means 24,000 tons more edible oil can be produced, enough to feed more than 6 million people for a year.

"Digging for gold in July, digging for silver in August." Now is the good season for oil tea mountain cultivation. As long as we seize the time to loosen the soil and remove weeds, this year's oil tea fruits will be large, the seeds will be plump, and the oil content will be high.

This year is a good year for oil tea, and the oil tea trees in various producing areas are bearing abundant fruit. Qingtian, Changshan and other counties in Zhejiang Province have launched an "oil tea production of 100 jin of oil per mu movement." People are looking forward to the good news of bumper harvests in various oil tea producing areas.

    油茶——优良的木本油料作物
    谢源孝
    油茶是一种经济价值很高的木本油料作物，茶油不仅是质量好的食油，而且可以做机器润滑油，润发油和用以制造肥皂、人造奶油以及农用杀虫剂的合剂等。茶子饼还可做肥料。油茶主要分布在南方各省，以湖南的种植面最广，全省八十六县中有八十三个县种有油茶林。
    油茶适生于温带地区的海拔在五百公尺以内、土层深厚、阳光充足的山地上。因为油茶不与粮棉争地，所以这种油料作物的生产就大有发展前途。浙江今春造林总面积中，油茶林占44.3％。湖南今春造油茶林一百六十二万亩，还计划在今冬明春扩种四百三十二万亩。预计今年全国新造油茶林将会接近一千万亩，即相当于解放前原有油茶林总面积的50％。
    油茶的产量高，产果期长。如果经营管理得好，年年修山，注意施肥的壮龄油茶林，每亩可产油一百来斤。湖南桃源县黄婆乡贫农袁七老六分地的五十二株油茶树，小年可得四十七八斤油，大年可产九十五斤上下，一般每亩也能产油四、五十斤，比油菜的单位面积产油量约高一倍。注意培育、生长正常的油茶树，可以连续结实八十年以上，而且当它接近衰老期的时候，还可进行一次萌芽更新：把树干齐地面截断，让它重新开枝发叶，三年后又开始结实，并逐渐进入盛产期。
    油茶种植后，一般要六年才开始结实；近年群众创造了插条法，使油茶提前三年结实，产量也高。
    油茶主要分白花油茶和红花油茶两种。白花油茶的品种很多：湖南的“寒露籽”，江西的“观音桃”，广西的“羊屎茶”，福建的“茶桃”和贵州的“小板油茶”，都是成熟早、产量高、油份足的优良品种。
    红花油茶是最近在广东的广宁、封川和浙江开化等县发现的野生树种。早春开红花，艳丽非常。秋季果实成熟，果大如广柑。虽然果皮厚和结果期较迟，但是产量比白花油茶高好几倍。因此，大家已开始注意发展红花油茶。
    经营油茶是江南山区群众的一项主要生产。浙江青田县素有浙南油库之称。这个县的章村区常年油茶收入等于全区稻田总收入的70％以上。因此，这些重点产区流传着“吃茶树、穿茶树、用茶树”的说法。
    目前全国旧有油茶林还有一半处于荒芜状态，产量很低。广西平均亩产茶油十四点七斤，浙江为十二点八斤，湖南不过十斤，江西、贵州等省产量更低，只有六斤左右。估计全国油茶单位面积产油量不会超过十二斤。油茶生产潜力，远没有得到应有的发挥。
    增产油茶的主要技术措施是及时修山。一般荒芜的油茶林只要掌握“三年一大修，一年一小修”，或者是“三年两头修”的规律，就能使产量提高几倍甚至十几倍。江西吉安县南龙乡欧阳富的一亩荒芜茶山，解放前因无力修山，每年只能摘茶果一箩多；1951年铲了一次山，到1954年就摘了茶果十二箩。如果各地争取在今年内把现有荒芜油茶林全部垦复，并加强油茶林的经营管理，二、三年后，以增产三倍计算，就能多生产二万四千吨食油，可以供六百多万人吃一年。
      “七月挖金，八月挖银”。目前正是油茶修山的好季节。只要抓紧进行松土除草，就能使今年的油茶果大籽肥、含油量高。
    今年是油茶的大年，各个产区油茶树结果累累。浙江省青田、常山等县已掀起了“油茶亩产百斤油运动”。人们都在期待着各个油茶产区的丰收喜讯。
