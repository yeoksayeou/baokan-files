Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, October 28th. To meet the increasing need for trial production of crude oil during the exploration of the Karamay oilfield, the Dushanzi Refinery has begun expansion. Of the twelve projects planned for expansion, five have already commenced. After all the expansion projects are completed by the end of March next year, the refinery's crude oil processing capacity will be doubled compared to its current capacity.

This year, after many exploratory wells in the Karamay oilfield started producing oil, the Dushanzi Refinery's crude oil processing equipment has been unable to meet the needs. Next year, the amount of crude oil to be extracted on a trial basis in Karamay will be seven times that of this year. Therefore, the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration has decided to expand the Dushanzi Refinery before the new giant refinery is put into production.

    独山子炼油厂
    新华社乌鲁木齐28日电　为了适应克拉玛依油田钻探期间试采原油量日益增长的需要，独山子炼油厂动工扩建。在准备扩建的十二项工程中，目前已有五项动工。全部扩建工程到明年3月底完工以后，这个炼油厂炼制原油的设备能力将比现在增加两倍。
    独山子炼油厂今年在克拉玛依油田许多探井出油以后，处理原油的设备已经不能适应需要。明年克拉玛依试采的原油量将等于今年的七倍。因此，新疆石油管理局决定在新建的一座巨型炼油厂未投入生产以前，先行扩建独山子炼油厂。
