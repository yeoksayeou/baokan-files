(By our correspondent in Kunming, October 29th) Over nine hundred agricultural producer cooperatives in the border regions of Yunnan Province have achieved universal increases in production, guaranteeing increased income for 90% of their members. According to preliminary trial distribution calculations, out of the 911 cooperatives in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Honghe Hani Autonomous Region, Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Region, Lancang Lahu Autonomous Region, Jiangcheng Hani and Yi Autonomous County, and the border counties of the Lincang Prefecture, 882 cooperatives achieved increased production, accounting for over 96%; 27 cooperatives experienced reduced production, and two maintained their output, together accounting for just over 3%. The cooperatives with increased production generally saw increases of 30% to 40%, with the smallest increases being 10% to 20%, and the largest reaching 100% to 200%. In individual cases, such as the Baha Cooperative organized by the Wa people of Cangyuan County, production increased more than fivefold due to the new paddy fields opened up after the establishment of the cooperative. All ten cooperatives experimentally established in Jinping County this spring have increased production.

On the basis of the widespread increase in production in the cooperatives, various localities have distributed approximately 70% of the total income to the members, guaranteeing increased income for 90% of the members. Of the twenty-two member households in the Lancang Lahu Autonomous Region United Cooperative, twenty households have increased their income, with one household experiencing no change and one household experiencing a decrease. Of the three hundred and four member households in the ten cooperatives of Jinping County, all but thirteen households have increased their income. In Ze Zhao Miao Mei Cooperative in Malutang Township of the county, all thirty member households have increased their income, generally by 50% to 100% compared to last year, with the largest increase being over 200%.

In this year's production, the above-mentioned cooperatives have generally utilized the superior conditions of the cooperative system to improve farming techniques and utilize the natural potential of the border regions to varying degrees. Some cooperatives have opened up paddy fields and dry land, expanding the cultivated area; many cooperatives have plowed, weeded, applied fertilizer, and selected and changed seeds more than before the establishment of the cooperatives. These days, the good news of increased production and increased income for members in the border cooperatives has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the local farmers of all ethnic groups for running cooperatives. Farmers in various places who have not joined the cooperatives are clamoring to join, and many mutual aid teams are actively creating conditions for establishing cooperatives. A mutual aid team in Xuan Gang Dam, Luxi County, has already set aside private plots, selected cooperative cadres, and requested government approval to establish a cooperative.

    云南边疆近千个农业社普遍增产
    各社可以保证百分之九十社员增加收入
    本报昆明29日电　云南省边疆地区的九百多个农业生产合作社，普遍获得增产，可保证90％的社员增加收入。根据初步试算分配结果，德宏傣族景颇族自治州、西双版纳傣族自治州、红河哈尼族自治区、怒江傈僳族自治区、澜沧拉祜族自治区、江城哈尼族彝族自治县及临沧专区边沿各县的九百十一个社，有八百八十二个社获得增产，占96％以上；有二十七个社减产、两个社保产，共占3％强。增产社一般都增产三成到四成，最少的增产一成到两成，多的达到一、二倍。个别的如沧源县佤族农民组织的坝哈社，由于建社后新开水田较多，增产五倍以上。金平县今春试办的十个社，社社都增产。在合作社普遍增产的基础上，各地又将总收入的70％左右分给社员，保证了90％的社员增加收入。澜沧拉祜族自治区联合社的二十二户社员，有二十户增加收入，不增不减和减少收入的各有一户。金平县十个社的三百零四户社员中，除十三户外，其余二百九十一户均增加收入。该县马鹿塘乡的则召苗美社，三十户社员户户增加收入，一般比去年增加五成到一倍，最多的增加了两倍多。上述这些合作社在今年的生产中，一般都运用合作社的优越条件，改进了耕作技术，不同程度地利用了边疆的自然潜力。有的合作社开出水田和旱地，扩大了耕地面积；许多合作社都做到比建社前多犁多薅，多施肥料，选种换种。这些天，边疆合作社增加生产，社员增加收入的喜讯，大大鼓舞了当地各族农民的办社热情。各地没有入社的农民纷纷要求入社，很多互助组正在积极创造办社条件。潞西县轩岗坝的一个互助组已经把自留地留好，并选出社干部，要求政府批准办社。　（云南日报编辑部）
