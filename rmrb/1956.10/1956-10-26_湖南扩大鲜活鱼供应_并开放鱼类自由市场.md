    Hunan Expands Supply of Fresh Live Fish
    and Opens Free Fish Markets

    Xinhua News Agency: After correcting the past phenomenon of more dried fish and less fresh fish in fish supply, the aquatic products department of Hunan Province has now increased the supply of fresh live fish on the market. Housewives can now buy fresh live fish from the vegetable market every day.

    Hunan Province is one of the major freshwater fish producing areas in China. However, in the past, some aquatic product cadres believed that fresh live fish were not easy to transport and store, so they processed more than 87% of the fish into dried fish. As a result, residents of urban factories and mining areas, and even residents of fish producing areas, found it difficult to get fresh fish.

    At a recent joint conference of bureau chiefs, managers, and field managers of the provincial aquatic product system, the Aquatic Products Bureau of the Hunan Provincial Department of Commerce focused on criticizing the unwillingness to sell fresh live fish, and demanded improvement of supply quality, especially striving to expand the supply of fresh live fish during the low temperature season this winter. Now that the winter fishing season is approaching, aquatic product supply departments have set up fifty-seven purchasing points in the Dongting Lake fish producing area, and some have even prepared mobile purchasing boats to concentrate the freshly caught live fish at any time and transport them by train and daily express passenger ships with ice. In addition to meeting the needs of residents in various fish producing areas, it is planned to transport about 10,000 dan of fresh live fish in the fourth quarter of this year to supply cities and industrial and mining areas such as Changsha, Zhuzhou, and Hengyang. Free fish markets will also be opened to organize fishermen to produce and sell on the spot, and fishmongers to purchase and sell on their own. In addition, it is planned to add and expand breeding farms in the suburban areas of cities and the Dongting Lake fish producing area to gradually ensure that there is sufficient fresh live fish to meet the supply throughout the four seasons.

    湖南扩大鲜活鱼供应
    并开放鱼类自由市场
    新华社讯　湖南省水产部门自纠正了过去鱼类供应上干多鲜少的现象后，目前上市的鲜活鱼已经比过去增多了，主妇们每天都能够从菜市场买到新鲜的活鱼。
    湖南省是我国主要淡水产鱼区之一。但是，过去有些水产干部认为鲜活鱼不易运输保管，把87％以上的鱼都加工成干鱼。这样，就使城市工厂和矿区的居民甚至连鱼产区的居民都不容易吃到鲜鱼。
    湖南省商业厅水产局在最近召开的全省水产系统局长经理场长联席会议上，着重批判了不愿销鲜活鱼的思想，要求提高供应质量，特别在今冬低温的季节里要努力扩大鲜活鱼供应。现在，冬季渔汛快要到来，各水产供应部门已经在洞庭湖鱼产区设立了五十七个收购点，有的还备有流动收购船，将刚捕上来的活鱼随时集中，利用火车和每天快班客轮加冰托运。除满足各鱼产地居民需要外，计划在今年第四季度内调运一万担左右的鲜活鱼供应长沙、株洲、衡阳等城市和工矿区。并开放鱼类自由市场，组织渔民就地自产自销和渔贩自购自销。另外，在城市郊区和洞庭湖鱼产区，还计划增设和扩大养殖场，逐步做到四季都有足够的鲜活鱼满足供应。
