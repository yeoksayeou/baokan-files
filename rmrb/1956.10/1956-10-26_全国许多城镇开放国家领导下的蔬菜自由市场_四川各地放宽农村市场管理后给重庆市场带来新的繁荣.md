Following the opening of free vegetable markets under state leadership in cities such as Guangzhou, Wuhan, Changsha, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Nanchang, and Harbin, as well as counties such as Xinhui and Wu Chuan in Guangdong Province, and Gu Cheng Town in Xiangfen County, Shanxi Province, the variety and quantity of vegetables on the market in these towns have significantly increased, and prices are fair and reasonable, satisfying consumers, transporters, and producers alike.

Previously, vegetable operations in these towns were monopolized by local state-owned commercial enterprises. Due to the unified management by commercial departments, there were too many circulation links, and the price regulations were too rigid, which not only affected the enthusiasm of vegetable producers and transporters, but also failed to meet consumer needs in terms of vegetable specifications and quantities. For example, at one point, the Nanchang Food Company could only supply two chickens a day, and the price of chicken rose from 70 cents to more than two yuan per kilogram. Patients, pregnant women, and convalescents throughout the city could not buy chicken. The vegetable supply situation in other cities was also poor. Due to the poor management of state-owned vegetable companies and unreasonable price regulations, residents of these cities often could only eat stale vegetables that had been stored for several days, and vegetable companies often suffered losses due to the accumulation and damage of vegetables.

Now, with the opening of free vegetable markets under state leadership, the operating links and costs have been significantly reduced because production and sales do not go through state-owned companies, which is profitable for both vegetable farmers and vendors, thus increasing their enthusiasm. At the same time, the variety and quality of vegetables have increased and improved compared to the past because quality-based pricing is adopted. On the first day Guangzhou opened its free vegetable market, farmers from the suburbs transported freshly picked cauliflower, Chinese kale, and other vegetables, which were enthusiastically purchased. A purchasing agent from a vegetable vendor cooperative group bought several bundles of wild rice stems in this market. Although the transaction price was slightly higher than the reference price published by the market, he was very satisfied with the quality of the goods he had chosen. In this market, some directors and production team leaders of agricultural production cooperatives saw that high-quality vegetables sold well and the price was appropriate, and they all said that they would mobilize their members to improve the quality of vegetables after returning to the cooperative.

With the increase in the variety of vegetables, consumers can also buy some fresh vegetables that have been out of stock for a long time. Wuhan's "Big Red Pepper," Guangzhou's "Willow Leaf Cauliflower," Xinhui County's large onions, garlic, and ginger, Wu Chuan County's Mei Lü Town's fresh fish, and Nanchang's chickens, onions, and potatoes have all resumed supply. The price of chicken in Nanchang has returned to the normal level of last year. Now, residents living in Tang He Market in the mountainous area of Wu Chuan County, Guangdong Province, can also buy fresh fish every day.

Although the leadership methods for the open free markets in these cities and counties are not consistent, most regions have adopted a method of managing the market that is led by state-owned commercial workers, with producers, vendors, and consumers jointly negotiating prices, with traders weighing the goods, and with mass supervision. On October 20, the day the Nanjing Vegetable Free Market started trading, farmers went to check the listed prices as usual, but the listed prices were gone. The traders told them that a reference price had been negotiated in the market by agricultural cooperatives, peddlers, consumers, and other parties, and both buyers and sellers could refer to this price for free transactions. A self-employed farmer brought a load of celery to sell. When he saw that there was no listed price, he deliberately raised the price to eighteen yuan per load, and no one was willing to buy his celery. Later, he lowered the price to thirteen yuan per load and sold it. According to the trader, according to the negotiated price, the best celery was fourteen yuan, and the lowest price was ten yuan. It was not disadvantageous for either the buyer or the seller to sell this load of celery for thirteen yuan.

The state-led free vegetable market has just been established in various places. Due to insufficient experience in market management, there are still some problems that need to be solved. In the Guangzhou market, there were inconsistencies between supply and demand, Xinhui County once experienced peddlers suppressing prices, and speculation was also discovered in Gu Cheng Town, Shanxi. However, some of these problems have been solved, and others are being addressed.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, October 23rd: As counties near Chongqing gradually open free markets under state leadership, the Chongqing market has begun to show new vitality since September and October. Merchants from places such as Dianjiang, Liangping, and Zhong County in Sichuan, who had not been to Chongqing for several years, are now bringing goods to Chongqing for sale. Some cooperative stores and cooperative groups as far away as Yunnan and Guizhou have also sent people to transport chili peppers and dried vegetables. Urban and rural transport stores in the city, which have close purchasing and sales relationships with rural areas, have recently transported more bamboo ware, wooden ware, and other supplies and non-staple foods than usual from various places. According to statistics from the Chongqing Native Products Exchange, from October 4th to 10th, the transaction amount of Chinese medicinal materials, mountain products, daily groceries, etc. in Chongqing reached more than 139,000 yuan, an increase of more than 52,000 yuan compared to late September. Chinese medicinal materials such as gastrodia elata, honey, radix rehmanniae, trichosanthes peel, and rhubarb, which were in short supply in the past, have also arrived one after another. More than 20,000 kilograms of dried bamboo shoots, which were once in short supply, have recently been transported, meeting the needs of the market.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the market, the Chongqing Municipal Commercial Administrative Department has changed the original Native Products Exchange into the "Chongqing Materials Exchange," designating that commercial personnel and merchants from other places who come to Chongqing for buying and selling must conduct transactions under the leadership of the Materials Exchange. The Materials Exchange has also jointly adjusted the prices of some Chinese medicinal materials and some local specialty products with state-owned commercial and cooperative commercial units, which were set too rigidly or were unreasonably priced. And according to the needs of the market in this city and other places, it conducts appropriate allocation and adjustment of Chinese medicinal materials and local specialty products on the market, avoiding the phenomenon of price gouging and panic buying in the market. For example, if the production of chili peppers in Hechuan County, Sichuan, is reduced and a batch of chili peppers needs to be purchased in Chongqing, the Chongqing Materials Exchange will organize a batch of chili peppers for the purchasing unit in Hechuan County to complete the transaction. Hunan Province needs miscellaneous grain flour, and Hubei needs bamboo strips and other local products, which are quickly purchased through the Municipal Materials Exchange. The Chongqing Municipal Commercial Administrative Department is currently further studying the new situations and new problems that have emerged in the state-led free market. Relevant units have convened several symposiums with merchants from Chongqing and various parts of Sichuan who have come to Chongqing to listen to their opinions.

### 全国许多城镇开放国家领导下的蔬菜自由市场  四川各地放宽农村市场管理后给重庆市场带来新的繁荣

    全国许多城镇开放国家领导下的蔬菜自由市场
    四川各地放宽农村市场管理后给重庆市场带来新的繁荣
    本报讯　广州、武汉、长沙、南京、杭州、南昌、哈尔滨等城市，和广东省新会县、吴川县，山西省襄汾县古城镇等地陆续开放了国家领导下的蔬菜自由市场后，这些城镇上市的蔬菜品种和数量显著增加，价格也公平合理，消费者、贩运者和生产者都很满意。
    在此以前，这些城镇的蔬菜经营都是由当地国营商业包揽的。由于商业部门统一经营，流转环节过多，对菜价规定得过死，不但影响了蔬菜生产者和贩运者的积极性，而且在蔬菜的规格和数量上，也远远不能满足消费者的需要。例如，有一个时期，南昌市食品公司每天只能供应两只鸡，鸡价每斤从七角涨到两元多，全市所有的病人、产妇和休养员都买不到鸡吃。其他城市的蔬菜供应情况也不好，由于国营蔬菜公司经营不善，价格规定得不合理，这些城市的居民们常常只能吃到一些存放了几天的陈菜，蔬菜公司还往往因为蔬菜积压损坏而亏本。
    现在，开放了在国家领导下的蔬菜自由市场后，由于产销不经过国营公司，经营环节和费用显著减少，菜农和菜贩都有利可图，因而提高了他们的积极性。同时，因为采取了按质论价，蔬菜的品种和质量都比过去有所增加和提高。广州市开放蔬菜自由市场的第一天，市郊农民就运来了新摘下的菜心、芥兰等蔬菜，购买者十分踊跃。有一个菜贩合作小组的采购员在这个市场上买了几束茭笋，虽然成交价格比市场公布的参考价格稍高，但是他对自己选购的好货色很满意。在这个市场上，有些农业生产合作社的主任和生产队长们看到质量好的蔬菜销路好，价钱又合适，他们都表示回社后要发动社员提高蔬菜质量。
    随着蔬菜品种的增加，消费者也可以买到绝市已久的一些鲜菜了。武汉市的“大红椒”，广州市的“柳叶菜心”，新会县的大洋葱、蒜头、生姜，吴川县梅绿镇的鲜鱼，南昌的鸡、洋葱和洋芋，都已恢复供应。南昌市的鸡价已回落到去年正常水平。现在，住在广东省吴川县山区塘?墟的居民，也可以天天买到鲜鱼吃了。
    这些城市和县镇对开放的自由市场的领导办法，虽然并不一致，但大多数地区采取了以国营商业工作人员为领导的、由生产者、贩运者、消费者三方共同议价，由交易员代为过秤，以及群众监督的办法来管理市场。10月20日，南京市蔬菜自由市场开始交易的那一天，农民们照例去看牌价，但是牌价已经没有了。交易员告诉他们，市场内经过农业社、小贩、消费者等各方议定了一个参考价格，买卖双方可参考这个价格自由成交。有一个单干农民挑了一担芹菜来卖，他看见没有牌价就故意抬价要十八元一担，一直没有人愿意买他的芹菜，后来才降到十三元一担卖掉了。据交易员说，根据议价，芹菜最好的是十四元，最低价十元，这担芹菜卖十三元，买卖双方都不吃亏。
    国家领导下的蔬菜自由市场在各地还是刚刚建立，由于对市场管理的经验不足，因此，也还有一些问题需要解决。广州市场上曾发生供需不协调，新会县一度出现小贩压价收购，山西古城镇也发现有人投机倒把。不过，这些问题有的已经解决，有的也正在设法解决中。
    新华社重庆23日电　随着重庆附近各县逐步开放国家领导下的自由市场，9月和10月份以来，重庆市场开始呈现新的气象。四川垫江、梁平、忠县等地有几年没有来过重庆的商贩，现在带着货物来重庆出售了。远在云南和贵州的一些合作商店和合作小组也派人运来海椒和干菜等。市内同农村购销关系密切的城乡贩运商店，最近从各地运到的篾器、木器等用品和副食品比往常多了。据重庆市土产交易所统计，10月4日到10日的七天中，重庆市的药材、山货、日用杂品等成交金额达十三万九千多元，比9月下旬增加了五万二千多元。天麻、蜂糖、生地、瓜壳、大黄等过去供应量很少的中药材，也陆续到货。一度供应紧张的干笋，最近也运到二万多斤，满足了市场的需要。
    重庆市商业行政部门为加强市场的领导，已经把原来的土产交易所改变为“重庆市物资交易所”，指定外地来重庆进行买卖的商业人员和商贩都要在物资交易所领导下进行交易。这个物资交易所还和国营商业、合作社商业单位共同调整了一些牌价订得过死或价格不合理的中药材和部分土特产品的价格；并根据本市及外地市场需要，对上市的中药材和土特产品进行适当的分配调剂，避免了市场上产生抬价抢购的现象。如四川合川县海椒减产，需要在重庆市采购一批海椒，重庆市物资交易所就为合川县采购单位组织一批海椒成交。湖南省需要杂粮粉和湖北需要竹篾条等土产，都通过市物资交易所很快买到了。重庆市商业行政部门目前正在进一步研究国家领导下的自由市场中出现的新情况和新问题，有关单位曾几次召集重庆市和四川各地来重庆的商贩开座谈会，听取他们的意见。
