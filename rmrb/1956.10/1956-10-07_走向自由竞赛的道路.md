    The "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy has ignited enormous creative enthusiasm in the hearts of writers and artists. Many veteran writers who had put down their pens for years have picked them up again. As far as I know, Li Jieren is writing the third novel in his series reflecting the life of the Xinhai Revolution, "The Great Wave," Xiong Foxi and Yang Hansheng are engaged in the creation of new scripts, Luo Jinan is brewing a long novel about life in Shanghai, and young writers, encouraged, are even more motivated. Zhang Xiao's "Starlight on the Construction Site" and Wang Meng's "Long Live Youth," which will soon be published, demonstrate the creative level of the new generation. Many comrades who were originally in working positions have also begun to write about their rich experiences. In this regard, Li Liuru's "Sixty Years of Change" has attracted the attention of many readers. All this shows the current high tide of creative sentiment. How to cherish this enthusiasm, support this enthusiasm, and guide this enthusiasm to fruitful and rewarding purposes, in order to prosper literary creation and improve the quality of literary creation, is the problem currently facing us.

    The Party's policy is clear, and the Party has always been driving the literary cause forward. Our literary experience proves that when literature is combined with the broad masses of the people, and when writers are filled with the thought of serving the working people, our literature has achieved rich results. Today, as we are building a new era of socialism, the Party has further proposed the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the "Political Report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Eighth National Congress" that the development of literature and art should be promoted through free competition and free discussion in accordance with the objective laws of literature and art themselves. This opens up a broader road in front of us, which can more fully unleash the individual creativity of writers and artists and create literary works that are vibrant, radiant, and emotionally powerful.

    We have done a lot of work to promote the advancement of literary undertakings. But in order to further develop creation and meet the spiritual needs of the people, we must truly push the literary cause onto the road of free competition. In order to accomplish this task, we should resolutely correct the ideological influence of dogmatism and sectarianism, the simple administrative methods in leadership work, and the bad tendencies of administrative organs in literary and art groups and literary and art publications. We need to carry out broad unity, absorbing writers with various artistic views and different artistic styles into our ranks. Within our ranks, Communist Party member writers must humbly and sincerely cooperate closely and learn from non-Party writers to actively unleash everyone's strength. At the same time, we hope that the Party and the government will strive to bring experienced veteran writers back to the literary front from other working positions. Because if we want to prosper creation, we must first have experienced writers who can create. We know that there are many such writers who are not currently focusing their energy on the most effective aspect, but if we help them get rid of various things that hinder their creation, based on their life experience and creative experience, they can write excellent works for our heroic era. Of course, the active emergence of young writers is always an aspect that we should pay close attention to, but only by combining the superb artistic skills of the older generation with the youthful strength of the younger generation can we powerfully guarantee the improvement of the literary quality of our generation. We also need to consider changing the administrative methods of organizing writers and organizing creation, so that writers do not live in the small world of the literary and art circles, but truly live in the broad social life, so that writers are not occasionally and fragmentarily, but always closely integrated with the construction life. For this purpose, we should create all conditions and use all methods to encourage and help writers to settle down in the countryside and factories for a long time, or be able to closely contact the residents of city streets. Countless experiences have proven that only by contacting widely and deeply can life experiences be enriched and good works be written. We also need to improve our literary publications well. At present, there are many literary publications, and the editors have indeed made great efforts and made various improvements, but they still seem to make people feel "familiar," because they all lack fresh styles and characteristics, and therefore often cannot arouse readers' special hobbies, and there is no competitive relationship between them. This situation needs to be changed very much. We cannot be satisfied with the established formats of publications, but should support creative publications with different styles and loved by the masses throughout the country, and launch competition with each other to make publications a good garden where a hundred flowers bloom. Of course, it is not without hardship and difficulty to carry out all these creative activities. The Writers Association is implementing the method of professionalizing writers and corporatizing publications, and we believe that this is conducive to free competition in creation. We hope that the state and the Party committees at all levels will give special support to all active creative activities organizationally. In particular, the creative time urgently needed by young writers and comrades engaged in amateur creation and the guarantee of life during the creative period must be specifically supported. In short, we should actively strive for all conditions conducive to free competition, unite all writers wholeheartedly, and unswervingly shoulder our own combat tasks, so that literature can more powerfully serve the construction of socialism.

    Of course, considering the issue of leadership in literary creation, we cannot but think of the responsibility of writers. It is undeniable that in these ten years of struggle, we have gained considerable creative harvests, but we are still far from playing the active role that we should play in the literary field. The vast majority of writers live among the people and constantly write excellent works of art; but here I want to talk about another phenomenon among us, that is, in the face of a stable and peaceful construction life, the sharpness in life and in art is disappearing, and we do not seem to be standing in the front as often as we did in the storm-like war and the land reform struggle. We do not live, breathe, and advance with the people as freely and frequently as we did, so a phenomenon of stagnation has appeared among some writers. May I ask, who allows a writer to have this power? I feel that we often do everything a writer should do, but often forget the one thing a writer should do most, that is, to be a person full of lofty ideas, a person who is truly deeply connected with the emotions of the people, a person who always has pursuit, exploration, and insight into life and art. The reason why I talk about this is because our literary front really needs a group of writers with a high level of ideological and artistic level. Without good writers, it is ultimately impossible to produce good works. Now let us all act more actively in the face of the huge construction life! Our people are creating a brand new socialist world day and night. What right do we have to stagnate, even for a minute! The infinitely rich and complex struggle of new life is calling for writers. In this solemn and beautiful era, I feel that we should further strictly demand ourselves, we should become an active force, a core force, a united force in the literary cause, we should look to the vast front, we must think about improving the level of an entire generation of literature, fully unleash the creative power of each person, and contribute good works. Now, the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" has sent us a loud signal of progress. Here, we deeply feel the active creative intentions of countless comrades in the literary work posts, that is: the tasks we have not completed today, we must complete them better tomorrow. Resolutely advance along the road of free competition, we believe that Chinese literature will surely prosper and a hundred flowers will bloom in the near future.

    走向自由竞赛的道路
    刘白羽
    “百花齐放，百家争鸣”这一方针，在文学家、艺术家心中，已经掀起了巨大的创作热情。不少搁笔多年的老作家重新拿起笔来。据我所知，李劼人正在写反映辛亥革命生活的第三部长篇小说“大波”，熊佛西、阳翰笙正在从事新的剧本的创作，罗稷南酝酿写一部关于上海生活的长篇小说，青年作家，受到鼓励，劲头更高，不久将发表的张晓的“工地上的星光”、王蒙的“青春万岁”，表现出新人的创作水平；不少原来在工作岗位上的同志也动手写起自己丰富的经历来了。这一方面，李六如的“六十年的变迁”引起了不少读者的注意。这一切说明目前创作情绪的高涨。怎样爱护这种积极性，扶持这种积极性，把这种积极性引导到有成效、有收获的目的上去，以繁荣文学创作，提高文学创作的质量，这就是目前摆在我们面前的问题。
    党的方针是明确的，党是一直在带动着文学事业前进的。我们的文学经验证明，当文学与广大人民结合起来，当作家充满为劳动人民服务的思想时，我们的文学取得了丰富的成果。今天，当我们在建设社会主义的新的时代里，党进一步地提出“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，刘少奇同志在“中国共产党中央委员会向第八次全国代表大会的政治报告”中指出，要根据文学艺术本身的客观规律，通过自由竞赛和自由讨论来推动文学艺术的发展。这就在我们面前展开一条更开阔的道路，可以更充分地发挥文学家、艺术家的个人创造性，而创造出有生命、有光彩、有感人力量的文学作品。
    我们曾经作过许多工作，推动文学事业的前进。但是为了进一步发展创作，满足人民精神生活的需要，我们就必须很好地把文学事业真正推进到自由竞赛的道路上去。为了完成这任务，我们应该坚决地纠正教条主义、宗派主义的思想影响，领导工作中的简单行政方式和文艺团体、文艺刊物的行政机关作风等等不良倾向。我们需要进行广泛的团结，吸收各种不同艺术见解和不同艺术风格的作家到我们的队伍里来。在我们的队伍中间，党员作家必须虚心地、真诚地和党外作家亲密合作、相互学习，来积极发挥大家的力量。同时，我们希望党和政府争取有经验的老作家，从其它工作岗位上，回到文学阵地上来。因为我们要繁荣创作，首先就要有有经验的作家能进行创作。我们知道有很多这样的作家，现在并没有把精力发挥在最有效的这一方面，但是如果我们帮助他们摆脱掉妨害他们创作的各种事情，凭他们的生活经验和创作经验，是可以为我们这英雄的时代写出优秀的作品来的；当然青年作家的积极涌现，永远是我们应该密切注意的方面，可是，只有把老一代的精湛的艺术技巧和青年一代的青春力量结合起来，才是提高我们这一代的文学质量的有力保证。我们还需要考虑改变一下组织作家、组织创作方面的行政方式，使作家不是生活在文艺界的小天地里，而使作家真正生活在广阔的社会生活中去，使作家不是偶然地、片段地，而是经常同建设生活紧密结合起来，为这目的应该创造一切条件，用一切方法鼓励、帮助作家们，长期定居到农村、工厂里去，或者能够密切地接触城市的街道居民。无数的经验证明，只有接触得广阔深入，生活经验才会丰富，才能写出好的作品。我们还需要很好地改进一下我们的文学刊物。目前文学刊物很多，编辑工作者也确实付出了很大的努力，作了种种改进，可是看起来却还使人感到“似曾相识”，因为既都缺乏新鲜的风格，特点，因而往往不能引起读者特殊的爱好，彼此也就不发生竞赛的关系，这种状况是非常需要改变一下的。我们不能满足于刊物的既定的格式，而应该在全国范围内，扶植有创造性的，各具不同风格，为群众所喜爱的刊物，互相展开竞赛，使刊物成为百花齐放的良好的花园。当然，要进行这一切有创造性的活动，不是不艰苦，不是没困难的。作家协会正在实行作家职业化和刊物企业化的办法，我们相信这是有利于创作的自由竞赛的。我们希望国家、希望各级党委从组织上，对于一切积极的创作活动，给以特殊的支援。特别是青年作家和业余从事创作的同志所迫切需要的创作时间和创作时期的生活保证，都是必须得到具体支援的。总之，我们应当积极争取一切有利于自由竞赛的条件，全心全意地团结一切作家，坚定不移地担负起我们自己的战斗任务，使文学更有力的为建设社会主义服务。
    当然，考虑到文学创作领导问题，我们就不能不想到作家的责任。无可否认的，在这斗争的十几年间，我们得到了相当丰富的创作收获，但是我们也还远没有在文学岗位上，起到他应该起的积极作用。绝大多数作家是生活在人民当中，不断地写出了优秀的艺术作品；但是在这儿想谈到我们中间另一种现象，就是在安定的和平建设生活面前，在消失着在生活上、在艺术上的锐气，我们似乎没有像在暴风雨式的战争中、土地改革斗争中那样经常地站在前面了，我们没有那样自如地、经常地和人民一道生活、一道呼吸、一道前进，因而在部分作家中出现了停滞不前的现象了。请问，谁允许一个作家有这种权力呢？我觉得我们常常作了一个作家应当作的一切事，结果却常常忘了一个作家最应该作的一件事，那就是自己要是一个充满崇高思想的人，一个真正与人民情感深刻结合的人，要是一个永远对生活、对艺术，有追求、有探索、有真知灼见的人。我所以谈到这一点，因为我们的文学战线确实需要一批有高度思想水平和艺术水平的作家，没有好的作家，究竟是不能产生好的作品的。现在让我们在巨大的建设生活面前都更加积极地行动起来吧！我们的人民正日夜不停地在创造一个崭新的社会主义世界。我们有什么权力停滞、那怕是一分钟的停滞呢！无限丰富、复杂斗争的新生活正在召唤着作家们。在这个庄严美好的时代里，我觉得我们应当更进一步地严格地要求我们自己，我们应当成为文学事业中的积极的力量，核心的力量，团结的力量，应当眼睛向辽阔的前方看，要为整个一代文学的水平的提高着想，充分地发挥每一个人的创造力量，贡献出好的作品。现在，“百花齐放，百家争鸣”方针，对我们发出了响亮的前进的信号。在这里，我们深刻地感觉到文学工作岗位上的无数同志们的积极的创作心意，那就是：今天我们还没有完成的任务，明天我们一定要更好地完成。坚决地沿着自由竞赛的道路前进，我们相信中国文学在不久的将来一定能够繁荣，一定能够百花齐放。
