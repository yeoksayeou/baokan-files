    Actively Breed and Promote Superior Varieties
    Heilongjiang Province Widely Establishes Seed Stations
    (Our Newspaper) In order to strengthen leadership over seed work and implement the provision of promoting superior varieties in the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967," the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture has successively established six regional seed management stations and fifty-nine county seed management stations in five special districts including Hejiang and Harbin; a small number of cities and counties with less cultivated land have also been equipped with full-time seed cadres.
    At present, the cadres of these seed stations have been basically fully staffed, and business has also been carried out successively. In order to improve the professional level of cadres and give full play to the role of seed stations, the Provincial Department of Agriculture, based on the principle of "building stations, training, and improving simultaneously," has held seed work cadre training courses in Jiamusi and Acheng twice since July 12.
    After the training courses, each station, in accordance with the spirit of the "Instructions of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee on Carrying Out Field Seed Selection, Evaluating Farmers' Good Varieties, and Effectively Doing a Good Job in the Acquisition, Promotion, and Storage of Improved Varieties and General Seeds of Field Crops," has formulated a good variety popularization plan and measures for carrying out seed selection work, actively cooperating with agricultural technology promotion stations in various regions to guide agricultural cooperatives in seed selection, seed retention, and organizing seed acquisition, storage, and other work. In order to further promote seed work, the Provincial Department of Agriculture has recently organized four working groups to go deep into various places to conduct key inspections and assistance.

    积极繁育和推广优良品种
    黑龙江省广设种子站
    本报讯　黑龙江省农业厅为了加强对种子工作的领导，实现“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）”的推广优良品种的规定，先后在合江等五个专区和哈尔滨建立了六个地区种子管理站和五十九个县种子管理站；少数耕地面积较少的市县也都配备了种子专职干部。
    目前，这些种子站干部已基本配齐，业务也相继开展。省农业厅为了提高干部业务水平，充分发挥种子站的作用，本着“边建站，边训练，边提高”的方针，从7月12日以来，先后两次在佳木斯和阿城举办了种子工作干部训练班。
    训练班结束后，各站都根据黑龙江省人民委员会“关于开展田间选种，评选农家良种和切实做好大田作物良种与一般种子的收购、推广、贮备等工作的指示”的精神，制定了良种普及计划和开展选种工作的措施，积极配合各区农业技术推广站，指导农业社选种、留种和组织种子的收购、贮备等工作。省农业厅为了进一步推动种子工作，最近又组织了四个工作组，深入各地，有重点地检查和帮助。
