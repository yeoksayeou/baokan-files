    Welcome President Sukarno
                    (I) Dear President Sukarno:
    When I learned of your visit to our country, I was so excited! I live in a small city on the coast of the East China Sea, and I don't have the opportunity to meet you, but I often see your dignified and peaceful appearance in various newspapers and periodicals, which makes me feel very close to you. Your opening speech at the Asian-African Conference was a good start to the conference and led to its brilliant success. Your speech during your visit to the United States righteously and sternly denounced colonialism, expressed the common voice of the Asian and African people, and won the praise of peace-loving people all over the world.
    As an ordinary Chinese citizen, I warmly welcome you to visit. I think all Chinese people welcome you. Please convey our people's love to the Indonesian people. We deeply cherish the significant contributions made by the Indonesian people to the cause of peace.
    I wish the Indonesian people prosperity and happiness!
    I wish you good health!
                                        Jiangsu, Nanhui, Ye Ruimou
                      (II) Respected President Sukarno:
    As an ordinary Chinese citizen, with a sincere and warm heart, I welcome you - President Sukarno to visit our country.
    The Chinese and Indonesian people not only have a long tradition of friendship in history, but also are good brothers standing shoulder to shoulder in the current struggle to defend peace, oppose war, safeguard national independence and build our motherland.
    Indonesia pursues an independent and autonomous policy, and has made great efforts and contributions to opposing war, opposing colonialism, maintaining peace and developing friendly cooperation between countries. Indonesia supports the national liberation struggles of the people of Sudan, Tunisia, and Algeria, supports India's recovery of Goa, supports Egypt's recovery of the Suez Canal Company, advocates the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations, and believes that China's territory of Taiwan should be returned to the Chinese people. This is righteous and outspoken in international affairs. Indonesia has made significant contributions to the success of the Asian-African Conference. Now, the Bandung spirit has become the common belief of the Asian and African people to unite against colonialism and maintain peace.
    Dear President, your visit to our country brings us the sincere friendship of the eighty-two million people of Indonesia. We are very grateful to you, and please bring our equally sincere friendship to the Indonesian people.
                                                Henan, Xu Ri

    欢迎苏加诺总统
                    （一）亲爱的苏加诺总统：
    当我得悉您来访我国的消息后，心里是多么激动和兴奋啊！我居住在中国东海之滨的一个小城市里，没有机会见到您，但我却常在各个报刊上看到您庄严和祥的容貌，使我感到很亲切。您在亚非会议上的开幕词是会议的一个良好的开端，使会议收到辉煌的成就。您在访问美国时发表的演说，义正辞严地斥责了殖民主义，表达了亚非人民共同的呼声，获得了世界爱好和平人民的好评。
    作为中国的一个普通老百姓，我热烈地欢迎您来访问。我想全中国人民都是欢迎您的。请转达我们人民对印度尼西亚人民的热爱，我们非常珍视印度尼西亚人民为和平事业所作的重大贡献。
    祝印度尼西亚人民繁荣和幸福！
    祝您身体健康！
                                        江苏　南汇　叶瑞谋
                      （二）敬爱的苏加诺总统：
    我以一个普通的中国公民身份，怀着一颗真诚热烈的心，欢迎您——苏加诺总统访问我国。
    中国人民和印度尼西亚人民不仅在历史上有过悠久的传统友谊，而且目前在保卫和平、反对战争、维护民族独立和建设祖国的斗争中，也是肩并肩的好兄弟。
    印度尼西亚执行独立自主的政策，对反对战争、反对殖民主义、维护和平和发展各国友好合作，作出了很大的努力和贡献。印度尼西亚支持苏丹、突尼斯和阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放斗争，支持印度收回果阿，支持埃及收回苏伊士运河公司，主张恢复中国在联合国的合法权利，认为中国的领土台湾应该归还中国人民，这是在国际事务上的仗义执言。印度尼西亚对亚非会议的成功作了显著的贡献。现在，万隆精神已成为亚非人民团结一致反对殖民主义、维获和平的共同信念。
    亲爱的总统，您这次来访我国，给我们带来了印度尼西亚八千二百万人民的真挚友情，我们非常感激您，并请把我们同样真挚的友情带给印度尼西亚人民。
                                                河南　旭　日
