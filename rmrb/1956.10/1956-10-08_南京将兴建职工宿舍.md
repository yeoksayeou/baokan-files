Nanjing to Build Staff Dormitories

(Our newspaper dispatch) Recently, many units in Nanjing have begun construction on another 410,000 square meters of staff dormitories. Nearly 40% of the project started construction in August and September. The vast majority of these dormitories are being built for the staff of state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private enterprises, as well as the faculty and staff of state organs and secondary technical schools, which will improve the living conditions of more than 25,000 employee households. Most of these new dormitories are designed according to the characteristics and requirements of the staff dormitories of various departments. They are not only well-lit but also aesthetically pleasing, while also implementing the principles of economy and suitability. (Zheng Shichuan)
