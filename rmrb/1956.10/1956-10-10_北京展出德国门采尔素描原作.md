Xinhua News Agency report: Original drawings by Adolf Menzel, the 19th-century German master painter, have been on display at the Soviet Exhibition Center in Beijing since the 6th.

This exhibition is organized by the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations, and it is the first time Menzel's works have been exhibited in China.

Liu Kaiqu, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Artists Association, delivered a speech at the opening ceremony. On behalf of the Chinese art community, he thanked the Ministry of Culture of the German Democratic Republic and the Berlin National Museum for bringing Menzel's original works, rare in the world, to China for exhibition. Liu Kaiqu said that Menzel was a rare and versatile great painter in the history of world art. His paintings covered a very rich range of subjects, and he was able to master various painting tools and techniques. More importantly, he faced and reflected the era in which he lived, all of which are worthy of learning by Chinese art workers.

Werner Schmidt, an expert in art history from the German Democratic Republic, then introduced the artistic characteristics of Menzel's works and the works exhibited this time. He said that China and Germany are building a bridge of great friendship, and he hoped that this exhibition could become a solid stone in this bridge.

The more than 200 original drawings exhibited this time were selected from Menzel's more than 5,000 surviving sketches. Since many of Menzel's historically significant oil paintings were damaged in World War II or lost after the war, only reproductions of some of his oil paintings and opaque watercolors were exhibited this time.

The exhibited works depict historical events, landscapes, figures, flowers, and works of art, etc. The largest number are sketches about real life and labor. Noteworthy among the exhibits are the artistic images of ordinary people that appeared in the works of this 19th-century painter—workers, peasants, soldiers, beggars, etc.

Among the exhibits are several sketches by Menzel about China—figures from Chinese dramas, incense burners, etc., which aroused great interest among visitors

　　北京展出德国门采尔素描原作
    据新华社讯　十九世纪德国绘画大师阿道尔夫·门采尔的原作，从6日起在北京苏联展览馆展出。
    这个展览会是对外文化联络局举办的，这是门采尔的作品第一次在中国展出。
    中国美术家协会副主席刘开渠在展览会的开幕式上致词，他代表中国美术界感谢德意志民主共和国文化部和柏林国家博物院把世界稀有的门采尔的原作送到中国展出。刘开渠说，门采尔是世界美术史上少有的多才多艺的伟大画家，他的画题材非常丰富，他能掌握各种绘画工具和画法，更重要的是他正视并且反映了他所处的时代，这些都是值得中国美术工作者学习的。
    德意志民主共和国艺术史专家威尔诺·施密特接着介绍了门采尔作品的艺术特点和这次展出的作品。他说，中、德两国正在修建着伟大友谊的桥梁，希望这次画展能成为这座桥梁的一块坚固石头。
    这次展出的二百多幅素描原作，是从尚被保存下来的门采尔的五千多幅素描中挑选出来的。由于门采尔的许多具有历史意义的油画在第二次世界大战中被毁损或在战后散失了，这次只展出了他的部分油画和不透色的水彩画的复制品。
    展出的作品描绘了历史事件、风景、人物、花卉以及艺术品等，数量最多的是关于现实生活和劳动的素描。展品中引人注意的是，出现在这位十九世纪画家笔下的普通人的艺术形象——工人、农民、士兵、乞丐等。
    展品中有门采尔关于中国的几幅速写——中国戏剧的人物、香炉等，它们引起参观者很大的兴趣。
    参加开幕式并且观看画展的有文化部副部长郑振铎，中国人民对外文化协会副会长阳翰笙，以及中国的美术家和美术学校的学生们。
    德意志民主共和国驻华大使纪普纳和许多国家驻中国的外交官员也参加了开幕式并观看了画展。
