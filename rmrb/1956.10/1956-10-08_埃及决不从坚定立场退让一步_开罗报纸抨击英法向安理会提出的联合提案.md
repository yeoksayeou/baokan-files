Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 7th: Cairo newspapers, in reporting the first meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the Suez Canal issue, condemned the Anglo-French proposal put forward by Lloyd at the meeting, which demanded international control of the Suez Canal.

    "The People's Paper" wrote that we will steadfastly defend the rights we had achieved before the Suez Canal issue was submitted to the Security Council for discussion. Any compromise that violates our sacred rights is not acceptable to us. All we can agree to is unconditional recognition of our complete sovereignty and independence.

    "The People's Paper" continued, we absolutely refuse to retreat a step from our firm position. We will continue to oppose any high-pressure policies that may harm our sovereignty, whether our enemies are united or disunited; whether they agree or disagree.

    "The Republic" accused Pineau in its editorial of disregarding the fact that France was a party to the Suez Canal dispute, and yet still decided to remain in the chairman's seat of the Security Council.

    The newspaper also published an article ridiculing the Western countries' attempts to undermine the unity of Arab countries. The article wrote that Lloyd adopted this customary British diplomatic approach in an attempt to intimidate Arab countries supporting Egypt. As early as the beginning of the Suez Canal dispute, the imperialists insisted that Egypt would be isolated, but the Arab countries and their governments stood in solidarity with Egypt.

    埃及决不从坚定立场退让一步
    开罗报纸抨击英法向安理会提出的联合提案
    据新华社7日讯　开罗消息：埃及报纸在报道联合国安全理事会讨论苏伊士运河问题的第一次会议的时候，谴责劳埃德在会上提出的要求国际管制苏伊士运河的英法提案。
    “人民报”写道，我们将坚定不移地保卫我们在苏伊士运河问题提交安全理事会讨论之前就实现了的权利。任何侵犯我们神圣权利的折衷办法都不是我们所能接受的。我们所能同意的只是无条件地承认我们的完全的主权和独立。
    “人民报”继续写道，我们绝对拒绝从我们坚定的立场上退让一步。我们将继续反对可能损害我们主权的任何高压政策，不管我们的敌人团结也罢，不团结也罢；不管他们同意也罢，不同意也罢。
    “共和国报”在社论中指责比诺不顾法国是苏伊士运河争端的一方，而仍然决定留在安全理事会的主席的位子上。
    这家报纸还刊登了一篇文章，嘲笑西方国家企图破坏阿拉伯国家的团结。这篇文章写道，劳埃德采用这种英国惯用的外交方式，企图吓唬支持埃及的阿拉伯国家。早在苏伊士运河争端的初期，帝国主义者就硬说埃及将陷于孤立，但是阿拉伯国家和它们的政府却同埃及团结一致。
