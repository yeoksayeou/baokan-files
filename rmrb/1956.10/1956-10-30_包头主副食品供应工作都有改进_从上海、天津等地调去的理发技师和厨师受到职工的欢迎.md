　　Baotou (本报讯) -- There have been significant improvements in the supply work in the new urban district of the emerging industrial city of Baotou. The number of grain and commercial supply outlets in the new urban district was only 45 at the end of June, but it increased to 100 by the end of September; a newly built department store opened in early October, offering 10,000 kinds of goods; the vegetable and food companies also regularly dispatch more than 40 mobile trucks to sell goods in various family residential areas. A street vendor market has also been established in the new urban district, attracting thousands of customers every day. The most popular are the small vendors selling various foods, whose average monthly turnover can reach about 1,000 yuan per household. The number of supply personnel in the grain and commercial departments has also increased greatly, reaching 2,000, more than double the number at the end of June. Service personnel transferred from Tianjin and Shanghai have service methods that are well-suited to the needs of construction site workers and their families. Chefs transferred from Tianjin's famous "Goubuli" steamed bun shop opened a steamed bun shop at the construction site, and many customers come here to eat; the Tianjin "Dafulin Restaurant" has also been well-received by customers after moving to Baotou. Watch repairers and barbers from Shanghai are often praised by the workers. They say that the barbers from Shanghai have good hairstyles, pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene, and repeatedly solicit opinions after the haircut, and have a good service attitude.
　　Currently, it is the season when autumn vegetables are being marketed in large quantities. The Municipal Vegetable Company has strengthened its ties with various agricultural cooperatives. The employees of the Vegetable Company process and sort all kinds of vegetables, removing the mud and rotten parts, and implement pricing according to different grades. The Vegetable Company also tries to reduce operating links and lower costs.
　　In terms of meat supply, the Municipal Food Company has sent more than 20 purchasing personnel to the Ulanqab League and the Ikezhao League to assist in the purchase of beef and mutton. The workers in the new urban district can also eat pork during festivals and Sundays. Various high-grade seafoods are also available here.
　　In order to improve the backwardness of the supply work, the Minister of Finance and Trade of the Baotou Municipal Party Committee and the Director of the Municipal Bureau of Commerce have repeatedly gone to the new urban district to inspect the work and urge improvements. In August, the supply departments in the new urban district also launched a "Service Quality Improvement Month" campaign, and the employees put forward many rationalization proposals. The Vegetable Company abolished the method of selling goods with numbered tickets; the canteens of the catering companies extended their business hours by two hours; the time for taking pictures at the service company's photo studio was shortened from ten days to three to five days; the method of retail sales of food and department stores was implemented; and the grain supply outlets are promoting the method of going door-to-door to issue invoices and collect payments, sending cadres to workers' homes to handle purchase procedures, and workers take the delivery note directly to the grain outlet to collect grain. As a result, the queuing and congestion of workers when buying things has been greatly reduced.

    包头主副食品供应工作都有改进
    从上海、天津等地调去的理发技师和厨师受到职工的欢迎
    本报讯　新兴工业城市包头市新市区供应工作，有了显著改进。新市区粮食商业供应门市部6月底只有四十五个，9月底增加到一百个；新建的一座百货大楼已在10月初开业，经营品种达一万种；蔬菜、食品两公司还经常出动四十多部流动货车，到各家属居住区出售商品。新市区还建立了摊贩市场，每天吸引着数千名顾客。最受欢迎的是出售各种食品的小摊贩，他们每户每月的营业额平均可达千元左右。粮食商业部门的供应人员也大大增加，目前已达两千人，比6月底增加了二倍多。从天津，上海调来的服务业人员，服务方式很适合工地职工和家属们的需要。从天津著名的“狗不理”包子铺调来的厨师在工地开设了饱子铺，到这里吃饭的顾客很多；天津“大福林饭庄”迁到包头开业后，也受到顾客的欢迎。由上海来的修表、理发技师，都经常受到工人们的表扬。他们说上海来的理发技师，理发样式好，注意清洁卫生，理完后反复征求意见，服务态度好。
    目前这里正是秋菜大量上市的时候，市蔬菜公司同各农业社加强了联系，蔬菜公司的职工把各种蔬菜都进行加工整理，去掉泥土和腐烂的部分，并实行分等论价。蔬菜公司还尽量减少经营环节，降低费用。
    在肉食供应上，市食品公司派出二十多名收购人员深入乌兰察布盟和伊克昭盟地区，协助收购牛羊肉。新市区的职工们每逢节日和星期日也可以吃到猪肉。各种高级的海味这里也可以买到了。
    为了改进供应工作的落后面貌，中共包头市委财贸部长和市商业局长曾数次深入新市区检查工作，督促改进。8月份，新市区供应部门又开展了提高服务质量运动月，职工们提出了很多合理化建议。蔬菜公司取消了卖牌售货的办法；饮食公司的食堂延长了两小时的营业时间；服务公司照像馆的取像时间，由过去的十天缩短到三天到五天；实行了食品和百货零卖的办法；粮食供应门市部正在推行深入到户开票收款的办法，派出干部到工人家中办理购买手续，职工拿着发货票直接到粮食门市部取粮。结果，大大减少了职工购买东西时的排队拥挤现象。　（春晓）
