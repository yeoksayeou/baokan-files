    New Oil-Bearing Structures Discovered in the Kumukuli Basin
    (Our report) Two geological teams from the 632 Team of the Ministry of Geology recently discovered six oil-bearing structures in the Kumukuli Basin, which is adjacent to the Qaidam Basin. According to the head of the Geology Section of the 632 Team, this basin has been confirmed as a new oil exploration base for the motherland.
    The oil-bearing structures discovered in the Kumukuli Basin are concentrated in two fold belts, with good closures and relatively large areas. Among them, some structures are different from the oil-bearing structures in the Qaidam Basin and are more suitable salt dome structures for oil storage. The discovery of salt dome structures in the Kumukuli Basin is a new discovery in China's petroleum exploration endeavors.
    The two geological teams of the 632 Team also found Jurassic strata with good oil-generating environments and Tertiary strata with considerable thickness in this basin. In addition, some other mineral deposits were also discovered.

    库木库里盆地发现新的储油构造
    本报讯　地质部六三二队的两个地质队，最近在和柴达木盆地毗邻的库木库里盆地发现了六个储油构造。据六三二队地质科负责人说：这个盆地已被证实为祖国新的石油勘探基地。
    在库木库里盆地发现的储油构造集聚在两个褶皱带中，圈闭很好，面积也比较大。其中，有的构造和柴达木盆地的储油构造不同，是更适宜储油的盐丘构造。在库木库里盆地找到的盐丘构造，是我国石油勘探事业中的一个新发现。
    六三二队的两个地质队还在这个盆地里找到了生油环境良好的侏罗纪地层和有相当厚度的第三纪地层。此外，还发现了一些其他矿床。
