Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, October 21st: The full-line survey of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway has been basically completed. Currently, surveyors are conducting comprehensive design work. Prior to this, due to the surveyors adopting a work method of measuring and designing simultaneously, they had already delivered approximately 160 kilometers of design data to the construction departments, enabling the key project of the Lou Shan Pass Tunnel to commence in July. The bridge spanning the Wu River is also about to begin construction.

The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway starts from Ganshui Town, Qijiang County, Sichuan Province, at the terminus of the original Qijiang Railway, extends southward along the Songkan River in northern Guizhou, traverses the Liangfeng Pass and Lou Shan Pass, mountains with elevations ranging from 1,300 to 1,600 meters, and arrives at Zunyi City, a renowned city in Chinese revolutionary history. It then crosses the perilous Wu River, known for its rapid currents, and passes through counties such as Xifeng to reach Guiyang City, the capital of Guizhou Province. The entire line is 340 kilometers long. Along this route, there will be more than 110 tunnels and over 990 large and small bridges and culverts, making the project very arduous. Among them, the Liangfeng Pass Tunnel is as long as 4,200 meters.

The preliminary survey work for the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway began in December of last year. Since 60% of the line has to pass through dangerous mountains and treacherous waters, the surveyors have put in tremendous labor during the survey. In order to quickly survey a cost-effective and high-quality line for the country, they have to struggle daily with many difficulties in mountain life.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, October 21st: The First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways is vigorously strengthening its construction leadership over the corresponding projects of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway in order to change the situation where these projects are lagging far behind the track-laying progress. The projects corresponding to the railway track-laying include water supply, station building, communication signals, locomotive facilities, and electrical services. So far, the track-laying project of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has exceeded the track-laying task stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan, extending nearly 100 kilometers further west. However, due to delays in design drawings and material supply, and insufficient attention from the construction departments to the corresponding projects, not a single water supply station along the Lanzhou-Yumen line has been completely built to date. A large portion of the signal, locomotive, and station building projects in the track-laying section of last year have also not been constructed. Therefore, the railway east of Yumen, approximately 500 kilometers, which was originally planned to be officially handed over for production by the end of this year, has had to be postponed to the second half of next year.

In response to this situation, the First Engineering Bureau has decided to make the five corresponding projects the focus of current construction, and has transferred a group of engineers and technicians to installation units such as locomotive and electrical services, and water supply engineering teams. It has allocated many construction machines and tried to solve the supply problems of steel and wood. A reserve plan has also been formulated for the special equipment required for the construction of corresponding projects. The station building project on the line east of Yumen, which is under full-scale construction, can be basically completed by the end of this year. The construction progress of other corresponding projects has also been greatly accelerated.

    加速新线铁路的建设
    川黔铁路定测基本结束　兰新铁路加强施工领导
    据新华社贵阳21日电　川黔铁路全线测定工作已经基本结束。目前，测量人员正在进行全面设计。在此以前，由于测量人员采用了边测量边设计的工作方法，已经向施工部门交了约一百六十公里的设计资料，使重点工程娄山关隧道能在7月份动工。横跨乌江的大桥也快要动工。
    川黔铁路北起四川省綦江县赶水镇原綦江铁路的终点，沿黔北松坎河向南伸展，横穿拔海一千三百公尺到一千六百公尺的凉风垭和娄山关等山峰抵达中国革命史上的名城——遵义市，再跨过水流湍急的乌江天险，经过息烽等县抵达贵州省省会——贵阳市，全线共长三百四十公里。在这条线路中，将有隧道一百一十多处，大小桥涵九百九十多座，工程非常艰巨。其中凉风垭隧道就长达四千二百多公尺。
    川黔铁路的定测工作是从去年12月份开始的。由于全线60％的线路要通过险山恶水地带，在勘测中测量人员们都付出了巨大的劳动。他们为了很快的给国家勘测出一条又省又好的线路来，每天都要和山区生活中的许多困难进行斗争。
    新华社兰州21日电　铁道部第一工程局正在大力加强兰新铁路相应工程的施工领导，以便改变这些工程远远落后于铺轨进度的现状。和铁路铺轨相适应的工程，包括给水、站场建筑、通讯信号、机务和电务。到目前为止，兰新铁路的铺轨工程已经超过第一个五年计划规定的铺轨任务，向西多铺了近一百公里。但是，由于设计图纸、器材供应迟缓，施工部门对相应工程重视不够，兰州至玉门沿线的给水站，至今没有一个完全建成；去年铺轨地段的信号、机务、站场建筑等工程，也有很大一部分没有修筑起来。因此原拟在今年年底正式移交生产的玉门以东约五百公里的铁路，只得拖到明年下半年。
    第一工程局针对这一情况，决定把五项相应工程作为当前施工的重点，并且把一批工程师和技术工人调给机务、电务等安装单位和给水工程队，拨给了许多施工机械，设法解决了钢材和木料的供应问题。修筑相应工程所需要的特殊器材，也订出了储备计划。正在全面施工的玉门以东的线路站场建筑工程，到今年年底就可以基本完工。其他相应工程的施工进度也都大大加快了。
