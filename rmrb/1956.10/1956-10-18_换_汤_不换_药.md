	Changing the "Soup" but not the "Medicine"

	The local state-owned Shanxi Chemical Factory began producing a "Red Star" brand battery in 1951. This type of battery was prone to power leakage, and in less than three years, it was squeezed out of the market by "Meidu," "Da Wuwei," "Golden Mouse," and other brands of batteries flowing in from other provinces. Starting in 1954, the local state-owned Shanxi Chemical Factory changed the name of the "Red Star" battery to "Gonghua" brand, and vigorously promoted the advantages of the "Gonghua" battery, such as strong light and long service life. However, in less than a year, consumers saw through it: the Gonghua brand was the same as the Red Star brand, only the brand name was different. The Jinan branch of the Provincial Department Store alone had more than 10,000 dozen in stock, all of which have deteriorated, resulting in a loss of more than 20,000 yuan. Seeing that the Gonghua brand was not popular, the local state-owned Shanxi Chemical Factory changed it again in 1955 to the "Taiguang" brand battery. This type of battery emitted a white light on the first day and a red light on the second day. Some department stores even reduced the price by 50%, but still could not sell them. The chemical factory reduced the price of the more than 20,000 dozen "Taiguang" batteries in stock from the original price of three yuan per dozen to six jiao, but still could not sell them all. Up to now, 150,000 dozen "Taiguang" brand batteries are still in the warehouse of the Provincial Department Store and cannot be disposed of.

	In order to improve product quality, the Shanxi Provincial Department Store suggested that the local state-owned Shanxi Chemical Factory send personnel to the grassroots sales units for inspection, but the factory did not accept it. In September, when the Provincial Department Store held a provincial supply meeting, they were invited to attend the meeting to listen to the opinions of the grassroots sales units on the "Taiguang" battery, but they also refused to participate. This kind of capitalist management style, which is unwilling to listen to consumers' opinions, unwilling to go down to conduct in-depth inspections, and only wants to deceive consumers by changing product brand names, is really unacceptable.	　　　　Zheng Yangmin

    换“汤”不换“药”
    地方国营山西化工厂从1951年开始生产一种“红星牌”电池。这种电池爱跑电，不到三年时间，就被外省流进来的“美都”“大无畏”“金鼠”等牌子的电池挤垮了。从1954年开始，地方国营山西化工厂把“红星牌”电池的牌名改为“工化牌”，并且大力宣传“工化牌”电池光强、使用时间长等优点。可是，不到一年，就被消费者识破了：工化牌跟红星牌一样，只不过招牌不同而已。仅省百货公司晋南分公司就积压着一万多打，现已全部变质，损失达两万多元。地方国营山西化工厂看见工化牌吃不开，又于1955年改出“太光牌”电池，这种电池第一天还发白光，第二天就发红光了。有的百货公司虽然削价50％，也还卖不出去。这个化工厂把库存的两万多打“太光牌”电池从原牌价每打三元降低到六角也不能全部脱手。直到现在，省百货公司仓库里还积压着十五万打“太光牌”电池无法处理。
    为了改进产品质量，山西省百货公司建议地方国营山西化工厂派员到基层销售单位去检查，这个厂不接受。9月，省百货公司召开全省供应会议时，又请他们到会上去听一听各基层销售单位对“太光牌”电池的意见，他们也不参加。这种既不愿听取消费者意见，又不肯下去深入检查，只想以改换产品牌名来欺骗消费者的资本主义经营作风实在要不得。　　　　郑仰民
