A peddler, shaking two pairs of socks in his hands in front of pedestrians, shouts: Five jiao a pair, a pair for five jiao; one yuan for two pairs, two pairs for one yuan.

Inside the store's glass cabinet, various kinds of socks are displayed, allowing people to choose and buy. The sales assistant attentively takes and delivers socks according to the customer's request and packages them.

The more loudly one shouts, the fewer goods one has. Those with more goods pay more attention to displaying their goods.

    小贩卖袜
    言思
    小贩在行人面前抖动着手里的两双袜子大喊：五角一双，一双五角；一元两双，两双一元。
    商店里的玻璃柜里，陈列着各色各样的袜子，任人选购，售货员殷勤地按照顾客的要求取送，包装。
    愈是高声叫卖，愈是货色不多，货色多的更注意于摆出自己的货色来。
