    Wishing Greater Development in Sino-Japanese Trade
    —A Letter to the Japan International Trade Promotion Association
    I am an ordinary citizen of China. On October 6th, I visited the Japanese Commodities Exhibition held in Beijing by you, and I was deeply moved. Therefore, I am writing this letter to you to express my respect for the hardworking Japanese people.
    At the commodity exhibition, we saw more than 15,000 kinds of goods exhibited by you. These exhibits demonstrated the wisdom and talent of the Japanese people. We deeply admire the diligence and excellent technology of the Japanese people. After seeing your exhibition, I feel even more that there is a very broad prospect for the development of trade between China and Japan. In order to promote the development of normal trade between China and Japan, you have done a lot of work, actively breaking down artificial barriers, and striving to bring some commodities that were "embargoed" to China for exhibition. This is of great significance for promoting normal trade exchanges between China and Japan.
    Our Chinese people are building our great motherland, and we need peaceful trade between countries to jointly promote economic prosperity and development. However, at present, there are still undue obstacles to peaceful trade between China and Japan. I sincerely hope that the Japanese people will continue to make greater efforts to break down all "embargo" barriers so that trade between China and Japan can develop normally!

    愿中日贸易有更大发展
    ——给日本国际贸易促进协会的一封信
    我是中国一个普通的公民。10月6日，我参观了你们在北京举办的日本商品展览会，十分感动，所以写这封信给你们，以表示我对勤劳的日本人民的敬意。
    我们在商品展览会上，看到了你们展出的一万五千多种商品。这些展品，表现了日本人民的智慧和才能。我们深深地热爱日本人民的勤劳和优良的技术。看了你们的展览会，我更觉得发展中日两国间的贸易有很广大的前途。为了促进中日正常贸易的发展，你们做了许多工作，积极打破人为的障碍，争取了一部分被“禁运”的商品来中国展出，这对于促进中日两国之间的正常贸易往来有很大的意义。
    我们中国人民正在建设着自己伟大的祖国，我们需要各国之间的和平贸易，共同促进经济的繁荣发展。但是，目前中日两国之间的和平贸易还存在着不应有的障碍，我衷心地希望日本人民继续作更大的努力，打破一切“禁运”障碍，使中日两国的贸易得到正常的发展！
