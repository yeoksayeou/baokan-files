Xinhua News Agency, Yumen Electric Dispatch, Xinhua News Agency reporter Yao Bingjian reported: As of September 30th, the Yumen Oilfield Mining Plant Trial Production Brigade had already exceeded its annual trial production plan for this year by 6.94%.

To determine the boundaries of the Laojunmiao Oilfield and the condition of certain new oil layers beneath the oilfield, the Yumen Oilfield had drilled a large number of oil exploration wells this year. These exploration wells need to undergo trial production to obtain geological data before it can be determined whether they have exploitation value and what kind of oil production equipment should be used for oil production.

This year, the trial production staff took various measures to speed up the trial production. They established a production command system, allocating specific time each day to study the problems existing in the trial production work and promptly devising solutions. When measuring oil layer pressure, they also promoted the "reverse production rate curve" method, which could obtain oil layer pressure one to two days faster than the old method. Since March of this year, the trial production personnel have also cooperated closely with the geological personnel. Geological personnel promptly organized data and made decisions, ensuring that trial production personnel could conduct trial production in a timely manner. In addition, trial production personnel also actively sought ways to overcome some difficulties caused by insufficient equipment and frequent work stoppages, accelerating the progress of trial production work.

Due to the accelerated trial production, not only was the situation of the Laojunmiao Oilfield boundaries and certain new underground oil layers rapidly understood, providing geological data for further development of the Laojunmiao Oilfield, but it also ensured that dozens of new oil wells were put into production in a timely manner, increasing the production of a large amount of crude oil.

    玉门采油厂试油大队
    超额完成全年试油计划
    新华社玉门电　新华社记者姚秉鉴报道：玉门油矿采油厂试油大队到九月三十日为止，已经超额6.94％完成了今年全年的试油计划。
    玉门油矿为了探明老君庙油田边界和油田下面某些新油层的情况，今年以来曾经钻凿了大批石油探井。这些探井需要经过试油取得地质资料以后，才能决定有无开采价值，以及采用何种采油设备进行采油。
    今年试油工作人员采取了各种办法来加快试油速度。他们建立了生产指挥制度，每天有一定的时间来研究试油工作中存在的问题，并且及时设法解决。在测油层压力的时候，还推行了“反产率曲线”的方法，这种方法比过去用旧法能加快一天到两天的时间求得油层压力。今年三月份以来，试油人员同地质人员配合得也很密切。地质人员及时整理资料，作出决定，保证了试油人员及时试油。此外，试油人员还积极设法克服了一些因设备不足，经常停工的困难，加快了试油工作的进展。
    由于试油速度的加快，不但迅速地了解了老君庙油田边界和地下某些新油层的情况，为进一步开发老君庙油田提供了地质资料，而且还保证了数十口新油井及时投入生产，增产了大批原油。
