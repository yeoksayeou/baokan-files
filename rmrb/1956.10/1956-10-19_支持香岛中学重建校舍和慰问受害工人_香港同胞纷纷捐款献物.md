Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th: Hong Kong message: Hong Kong compatriots are donating money and goods to support the reconstruction of Heung To Middle School and to console workers who suffered in the Kowloon riots.

The Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" has received many letters of sympathy and donations to be forwarded to Heung To Middle School in recent days. A parent of a Heung To Middle School student personally delivered 500 yuan in cash and a letter of condolence to the "Ta Kung Pao" office, entrusting the "Ta Kung Pao" to forward it to Heung To Middle School. He said, "I have a responsibility to support the school's reconstruction." A resident surnamed Gao donated his beloved sewing machine for auction, intending to use the proceeds to support the reconstruction of the new school building for Heung To Middle School. A manager of a Western medicine store said in his letter, "For the sake of educating the next generation, we should uphold the spirit of supporting the construction of Heung To Middle School in the past and launch a fundraising campaign to build the school so that the school can be rebuilt as soon as possible." A teacher in Kowloon said in his letter, "Your school has suffered such great losses and damage innocently, just as the thugs inflicted on my family." Many other readers expressed deep sympathy and condolences for Heung To Middle School's unfortunate experience in their donation letters, and expressed their respect for their heroic struggle to protect the school and their indomitable spirit.

The "Wen Wei Po" published a letter from a group of Kowloon garment workers today. The letter expressed deep condolences to the families of the workers who were killed by the thugs in the riots. This group of garment workers also sent the 28 yuan they collected to the "Wen Wei Po" office on the 17th, requesting it to be forwarded to the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions.

A reader surnamed Huang said in a letter: "These appalling things done by the thugs should be severely punished! We should extend a hand of sympathy to the affected compatriots, express our condolences to the deceased, and extend our sincere condolences to the families of the victims."

Some readers also requested in letters to the "Ta Kung Pao" that the British authorities should seriously investigate and bring the masterminds of this riot to justice and severely punish them in order to appease public anger and reassure the business community.

    支持香岛中学重建校舍和慰问受害工人
    香港同胞纷纷捐款献物
    新华社广州18日电　香港消息：香港同胞纷纷捐款献物，支持香岛中学重建校舍和慰问在九龙暴乱中受难工人。
    香港“大公报”连日来接到不少要求转给香岛中学的慰问信和捐款。香岛中学的一位学生家长亲自将现款五百元和慰问信一封送给“大公报”社，托“大公报”社转给香岛中学。他说：“我有责任支持该校的重建。”一个姓高的居民把他心爱的缝衣车捐出来拍卖，准备将卖得的款项支持香岛中学重建新校舍。一位西药房经理在他的信里说：“为了教育下一代，我们应秉以往支持香岛中学建校的精神，发起捐款建校运动，使该校得以早日重建。”九龙一个教师在他的信里说：“贵校无辜受到如此浩大的损失和破坏，也尽如匪徒们施之于我的家属一样。”还有许多读者在捐款信中，对香岛中学此次不幸遭遇，表示深切同情和慰问，并对他们英勇护校的斗争和不屈不挠的精神表示敬意。
    “文汇报”今天刊载了一群九龙缝纫业工友的来信。信中对在这次暴乱中被暴徒杀害的工友家属，表示深切慰问。这群缝纫业工友17日还把他们捐集的二十八元送到“文汇报”社，要求转给港九工会联合会。
    一位姓黄的读者在信中说：“在这次暴徒干出这些惨绝人寰的事情，应该受到最严厉的处分！对于受害同胞我们要伸出同情的手，对死亡者致哀，对受害者的家属作亲切的慰问。”
    还有一些读者在给“大公报”信中要求英国当局应该认真彻查这次指使暴乱的祸首归案严惩，以释民愤，而安商场。
