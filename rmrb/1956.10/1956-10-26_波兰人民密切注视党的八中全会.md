In the past week, the Polish people have been watching the progress of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party with fervent enthusiasm.

In Warsaw, the capital, from the time the Central Plenary Session opened on October 19, workers in many factories stayed in the factory, not returning home for one, two, or three days, waiting for news of the meeting's progress every hour and every minute. In other parts of Poland, the working people were also closely watching the progress of the meeting. Everyone I encountered in Poland believed that this meeting was the most significant political event in Poland in eleven years.

Mass rallies and party organization meetings were held at the Warsaw Motorcycle Factory, the Automobile Factory, the Rosa Luxemburg Factory, the Kasprzak Radio Factory, the Industrial University, the Polish Writers' Association, the Warsaw Institute of Social Sciences, and many other units. People enthusiastically participated in these meetings and spoke with great passion. I personally attended a rally held at the Warsaw Industrial University on October 20, with approximately 25,000 people attending, crowding the entire venue – the school auditorium – to overflowing. Most of those attending were students, cadres, and factory workers. Workers from the Nowa Huta Lenin Metallurgical Combine in Krakow and university students from Krakow also sent representatives to attend the meeting. A worker representative from the A-5 Factory read out the factory's resolution at the meeting, saying, "We will not leave the factory. We will not leave the factory until the Eighth Plenary Session has a satisfactory result." Those present expressed concern about the visit of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee delegation headed by Khrushchev to Warsaw during the Eighth Plenary Session and raised some opinions on this matter. Staszewski, Secretary of the Warsaw Municipal Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, answered the questions raised at the meeting. At rallies held throughout Warsaw, people were in high spirits and launched heated discussions on various issues related to national life and their own units and departments. These rallies also passed resolutions or wrote letters to the Party Central Committee Plenary Session, expressing their support for the Party Central Committee's program of struggle to establish genuine socialist democracy, strengthen Polish-Soviet friendship, and defend Polish national sovereignty. Many rallies also put forward various suggestions, proposals, and demands related to the life of the state and the Party.

In a letter to the Central Plenary Session, party activists from the Warsaw Motorcycle Factory expressed their support for Gomulka's return to work in the Party's leadership bodies. The grassroots party organization of the Warsaw Automobile Factory said in a letter, "We expect that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, while making correct political and economic resolutions, will also make decisions on organizational and personnel issues that are in line with the attitude of the party members."

The open letter from the Warsaw Industrial University said,
  "The current economic management system hinders the development of productive forces, therefore, we support workers in finding new and effective ways to manage enterprises." The letter also said, "We believe that solidarity with the Soviet Union, China, and all People's Democratic countries should be the basic principle of our country's diplomatic and economic policy, but this solidarity and alliance should under no circumstances hinder the sovereignty of any country and their own chosen path to socialism."

Tens of thousands of people expressed their support for the Party Central Committee's democratization measures in resolutions and documents, supported the thorough restoration of the Leninist principles of Party life, and opposed the tendency to regress that would hinder this democratization process.

Machine-building workers in Poznan (including workers from the Stalin Locomotive Factory), coal miners in Katowice, as well as students from Jagiellonian University in Krakow and workers from the Pafawag Factory in Wrocław, also held similar rallies. After discussions, participants in rallies in various places also sent delegations to Warsaw to express their attitudes and views on various aspects of national life to the Party Central Committee Plenary Session.

During the Party's Eighth Plenary Session, the leaders of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party also received delegations from various places and discussed various issues with them. Countless letters and resolutions poured into the Party Central Committee. The connection between the Party's highest leading organs and the working masses has never been so close, and the hearts of the Party and the masses are closely linked.

In the past few days, the people of Warsaw have remained vigilant, ensuring the normal order of the capital, not allowing any confusion, and preventing reactionary elements from taking advantage of this confusion to create incidents. The Warsaw Automobile Factory said in a letter to the Eighth Plenary Session, "Our criticism is only aimed at striving for the complete realization of socialist democracy, and we will fight with all our might against those who think that our democratization seems to be the first step towards bourgeois democracy." From what I witnessed at the Warsaw Industrial University, the workers and students demonstrated a high degree of discipline and political calmness and clarity at the rallies. Many enterprises throughout Poland, while paying attention to the discussions of the Eighth Plenary Session, were also actively working. The day the meeting closed on October 21 was a Sunday, but many workers still worked overtime. Of the more than 700 people in the blast furnace team of the Katowice Peace Metallurgical Factory, only three blast furnace workers were absent from work; that day, the workers over-fulfilled the plan by smelting almost 120 tons of pig iron. Three coal mines in the Silesian coal district completed more than 20% of their daily production plan.

On the night of October 21, when the Central Committee Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party passed the resolutions put forward by the Political Bureau and elected a new leadership and declared its end, the "People's Tribune" and "Warsaw Life News" both issued extra editions. Newsboys, auto workers, motorcycle factory workers, etc. – were surrounded by people buying newspapers. Many people came out of their homes in their pajamas and lined up in the cold wind to wait to buy newspapers. The extra editions were quickly snapped up.

An article published in the extra edition of the "People's Tribune" was the most exciting. It truly expressed the feelings of millions of ordinary Poles in those days. It wrote: "Now that we have a new leadership, we can say that this leadership was not only elected by the Central Committee, but by millions of people across the country, by the entire Party. For three days, millions of working people, youth, intellectuals, soldiers, and officers – the entire society, the entire people – participated in the discussion of the plenary session. Today we can cheer without boasting or exaggeration: Long live the great victory achieved by the Party on the road of continuous democratization of our country! Long live the fraternal alliance of the socialist camp! Long live sovereignty! Long live peace and socialism! Long live the new leadership of our Party headed by Comrade Gomulka, who will lead us to realize correct and just plans!" (Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 25th)

    波兰人民密切注视党的八中全会
    新华社驻华沙记者　谢文清
    在过去的一星期中，波兰全国人民都以沸腾的热情注视着波兰统一工人党中央委员会第八次全体会议的进展。
    在首都华沙，从这次中央全会在10月19日开幕之时起，许多工厂的工人都留在厂里，一天、两天、三天不回家，每小时、每分钟守候着会议进展的消息。在波兰其他各地，劳动人民也密切地注视着会议的进展。记者所接触到的波兰人都认为，这次会议是十一年来波兰最重大的政治事件。
    华沙的摩托车工厂、汽车工厂、罗萨·卢森堡工厂、卡斯普尔扎克无线电工厂、工业大学、波兰作家协会和华沙社会科学研究所以及其他许多单位都举行了群众集会和党组织的会议。参加这些会议的人十分踊跃，发言也十分热烈。记者亲自参加了华沙工业大学在10月20日举行的一次集会，参加会议的大约有两万五千人，他们把整个会场——学校大礼堂挤得水泄不通。到会的人大多是学生、干部和工厂工人。远在克拉科夫的诺瓦胡塔列宁冶金联合企业的工人和克拉科夫的大学生也派代表参加了这次集会。A—5工厂的工人代表在会上宣读这个工厂的决议说，“我们将不离开工厂。在八中全会没有满意的结果以前，决不离开工厂”。到会的人对于以赫鲁晓夫为首的苏共中央代表团在八中全会期间来到华沙访问一事表示关切，并且对此提出了一些意见。波兰统一工人党华沙市委会书记斯塔谢夫斯基在会上解答了提出的问题。在华沙各处举行的集会上，人们情绪激昂，纷纷就有关国家生活和本单位、本部门的各种问题展开热烈的讨论。这些集会还通过了决议，或者写信给党中央全会，表示拥护党中央为建立真正的社会主义民主、为加强波苏友好、为保卫波兰国家主权而斗争的纲领。许多集会还提出了有关国家和党的生活的各种建议、主张和要求。
    华沙摩托车工厂的党的活动分子在给中央全会的信中，表示支持哥穆尔卡回到党的领导机构工作。华沙汽车工厂基层党组织在信上说，“我们期望，中央委员会第八次全体会议在作出正确的政治决议和经济决议的同时，还将就组织问题和人事问题作出符合党员群众的态度的决定”。
    华沙工业大学的公开信中说，
  “目前的经济管理制度阻碍着生产力的发展，因此，我们支持工人寻找新的管理企业的有效方式。”这封信还说，“我们认为同苏联、中国和一切人民民主国家的团结，应该是我国外交和经济政策的基本原则，但是这种团结和联盟在任何情况下不应妨碍任何一国的主权和它们自己挑选的走向社会主义的道路”。
    成千上万的群众在决议和文件中表示支持党中央的民主化措施，拥护彻底恢复党的生活的列宁准则，反对阻止这种民主化过程的倒退的倾向。
    波兹南的机器制造工人（其中包括斯大林机车工厂的工人）、卡托维兹的煤矿工人，以及克拉科夫的雅吉隆大学的学生、弗罗茨瓦夫的巴发瓦克工厂的劳动者，也举行了类似的集会。各地集会的参加者经过讨论以后，还派遣代表团到华沙，向党中央全会表示他们对国家生活各方面的态度和主张。
    在党的八中全会开会期间，波兰统一工人党中央的领导者们还接见了来自各地的代表团，同它们讨论各种问题。许许多多的信件和决议络绎不绝地送到党中央委员会。党的最高领导机关和劳动群众的联系从来没有过这样的密切，党和群众的心紧紧地连在一起了。
    在过去的几天中，华沙人民都保持着警惕，确保首都的正常秩序，不准有任何混乱现象，防止反动分子利用这种混乱来制造事件。华沙汽车工厂在给八中全会的信中说，“我们的批评只是为了力求社会主义民主的完全实现，我们将以全力同那些认为我们的民主化好像是转向资产阶级民主的第一步的人们斗争到底。”从记者在华沙工业大学目睹的情况看来，工人和学生在集会上表现了高度的纪律性和政治上的冷静与清醒。全波兰的许多企业一方面注视八中全会的讨论，另一方面也在积极地劳动。10月21日会议闭幕的日子是星期天，但是，还有许多工人破格加班工作。卡托维兹和平冶金工厂高炉组七百多人中，只有三个高炉工人没有上班；那一天，工人们超计划熔炼了几乎一百二十吨生铁。西里西亚煤区有三个煤场完成了日产量计划20％以上。
    10月21日夜间，当波兰统一工人党中央全会通过了政治局所提出的决议案和选出了新的领导机构而宣告结束的时候，“人民论坛报”和“华沙生活报”都出了号外。卖报的学生、汽车工人、机器脚踏车工厂工人等——被买报的人包围起来。许多人穿着睡衣走出户外，在冷风里排着队等候买报。号外很快就被抢光了。
    “人民论坛报”的号外上发表的一篇文章是最激动人心的。它确确实实表达了千百万普通波兰人在这些日子里的情感。它写道：“现在我们有了新的领导机构，我们可以说，这个领导机构不是仅仅由中央委员会选举出来的，而是由全国千百万人民、由全党选举出来的。三天来，千百万劳动人民、青年、知识分子、士兵和军官——整个社会、全国人民都参加了全体会议的讨论。我们今天可以毫不炫耀和夸张地欢呼：党在不断对我国进行民主化的道路上所取得的伟大胜利万岁！社会主义阵营的兄弟般的联盟万岁！主权万岁！和平和社会主义万岁！将领导我们去实现正确而公正的计划的、以哥穆尔卡同志为首的我们的党的新的领导机构万岁！”　（新华社华沙25日电）
