    Excerpts from the Yangtze River Bridge Construction Site
    The Tense and Busy Bridge Construction Site
    As of October 1st, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project is estimated to be 60% complete. Three bridge piers stand tall in the river, and over twenty approach bridge piers are neatly arranged on both banks like the sluice gates of a large reservoir, enabling trains on the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou railways to directly reach the bridgehead. On the Hanyang side, the steel beams have already crossed the No. 1 pier and are about to cross the No. 2 pier. Now, standing by the river, one can get a preliminary idea of the future outline of the Yangtze River Bridge, and also see the busy scene of the bridge construction site. The five bridge piers under intense construction are surrounded by various types of crane ships, barges, and power generation ships, which occasionally spray high columns of water. Small tugboats transporting materials and workers frequently travel back and forth between the piers. Trains, whistling, pass through the mountainside of Turtle Mountain and Snake Mountain, continuously transporting steel beams to the bridgehead. The sound of riveting steel beams on both banks echoes over the Yangtze River. At night, the construction site is brightly lit. From a distance, the lights of the bridge pier construction site look like clusters of blooming flowers, and the electric lights installed along the steel beams, row upon row, string upon string, look even more like wintersweet in winter, which is quite beautiful. Thousands of workers are working day and night under the illumination of these lights.
    Guaranteeing the Quality of Steel Beam Erection
    The Yangtze River Bridge adopts the "cantilever assembly method" to erect steel beams. If the riveting is not done well, the erection cannot continue. The rivets used for the bridge are as long as 230 mm, longer and thicker than ordinary rivets, making them difficult to rivet together. In order to ensure the quality of the riveting work, a Soviet expert once lost sleep for five nights due to a quality problem. Engineer Luo Qibin, who is in charge of the beam erection project, is also constantly pondering how to improve the technical level of the riveters. One night, someone recommended the technique of Song Dazhen, a seventh-grade riveter from the Mechanical Leasing Station. He wrote a letter that night asking Song Dazhen to assist in the riveting work. Song Dazhen rushed to the construction site and riveted dozens of rivets in a row, with good quality, and received praise from the Soviet experts. Since then, Song Dazhen has also participated in the steel beam erection work. The rivet loss rate of the team he leads has been reduced by 7% compared to the past, and the number of rivets riveted has also increased from a maximum of 110 rivets per shift to more than 400.
    Careful Calculation to Save Materials
    Since the beginning of this year, the supply of building materials nationwide has been tight. The Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau called on all units to explore potential material resources, and the entire bureau responded enthusiastically. A total of more than 750 tons of steel were collected at the construction site, of which more than 420 tons were used for the project, and more than 330 tons were handed over to the state. They also saved 1,088 tons of cement from June to September. The 15,000 cubic meters of wood pre-purchased in the second quarter was also canceled because the workers paid attention to saving wood. In order to save materials, they also established a material multi-review system and organized various units to share materials with each other. As a result, more than 100 tons of steel were reduced in the second quarter.

    长江大桥工地片断
    紧张繁忙的大桥工地
    武汉长江大桥的工程到10月1日为止，预计已完成60％，有三座水中桥墩屹立江中，二十多座引桥桥墩像大水库的闸门似的整齐地排列在两岸，使京汉、粤汉铁路的火车能直接开到桥头，汉阳岸的钢梁也跨过了一号桥墩，快跨上二号桥墩。现在，站在江边观望，便能初步看出长江大桥未来的轮廓，同时也能看见大桥工地繁忙的景象。正在紧张施工的五个水中桥墩的周围聚集着各式各样的吊船、屯船和发电船等，并不时喷出高高的水柱。拖运材料和运送职工的小火轮，频繁地往返在各个桥墩之间。鸣着汽笛的火车，穿过龟山、蛇山山腰，不断地将钢梁运到桥头。两岸的拼接钢梁的铆钉抢声响彻长江上空。夜晚，工地灯火辉煌，远望去，那水中桥墩工地的灯光像一团团盛开的花朵，那沿着钢梁安设的电灯，一排排，一串串，更像冬天的干枝梅，煞是好看。几千名职工就在这灯光照耀下，夜以继日地紧张劳动着。
    保证钢梁架设工程的质量
    长江大桥是采用“悬臂拼装法”架设钢梁，如果铆合不好，便不能继续架设，而大桥所用的铆钉长达二百三十公厘，比一般的铆钉都长，都粗，很难铆合。为了保证铆合工的质量，有一位苏联专家曾经因为一个质量问题有五个夜晚没睡好觉；负责架梁工程的罗其斌工程师也终日在琢磨如何提高铆工的技术水平。一天夜晚，有人向他推荐机械经租站的七级铆工宋大振的技术，他当晚就写信请宋大振来协助拼铆工作，宋大振赶到工地，连续铆了几十个铆钉，质量很好，得到苏联专家的赞扬。宋大振从此也参加了钢梁架设工作，他所领导的小组的铆钉损耗率比过去降低了7％，铆的数量也由过去一班最高铆一百一十个铆钉提高到四百多个。
    精打细算节约材料
    今年以来，全国建筑材料供应紧张，长江大桥工程局号召各单位发掘潜在物资力量，全局热烈响应。工地上一共收集了七百五十多吨钢材，其中有四百二十多吨用到工程上去了，有三百三十多吨交给了国家。他们还在6至9月中节约了水泥一千零八十八吨。第二季度预购的一万五千立方木材，也因为职工们注意节约木料，而取消了原订的合同。为了节约用料，他们还建立了材料多次审查的制度，并组织各单位在材料上互通有无，因此在第二季度核减一百多吨钢材。
