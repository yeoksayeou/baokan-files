    Who Will Win the Basketball Championship?
    Li Yinglian
    Today is the last day of the basketball selection competition. The first game is Hong Kong team versus Macau team, and the second game is the championship battle of this selection competition: the All-Star team versus the Shenyang Military Region basketball team.
    The first battle between Hong Kong and Macau will surely arouse great interest among the audience. The individual skills of the players from both Hong Kong and Macau are very good, their movements are meticulous and flexible, and the two- or three-person screens and cooperation are very skillful. The encounter between these two teams will be particularly interesting, and there will definitely be many wonderful performances.
    The second championship battle will inevitably be tense and fierce. The All-Star team lost to the Tianjin team in the first battle, and their morale was frustrated. When the Tianjin team lost to the Public Security team, the All-Star team's mood turned high again (because the Public Security team lost to the All-Star team), and they defeated the Macau team by a large margin. In the group stage, the All-Star team scored the most points and still ranks first in the group. The All-Star team is originally a strong team, with better physical conditions, more comprehensive techniques and tactics, especially a strong bench, which is superior to other teams, so they are quite confident in winning the championship.
    However, the Shenyang Military Region basketball team is also not weak. In the group round-robin, their record is brilliant. They defeated the Beijing team, the Shenyang team, and the Hong Kong team by twenty points or more, and won the first place in the group with great advantage. From the performance of these games, the whole team's cooperation is skilled, the fast break is rapid, the sprinting power is strong, the positional attack is also calm, and the mid-range shooting is very accurate. In addition, the combination of mid-range shooting and individual breakthrough is also very good, and the offensive power is great.
    Although the All-Star basketball team has many superior conditions, their technical level is still not solid enough, and they are prone to tension and impatience. Especially when the opponent wins a few points, they cannot fight tenaciously and calmly to reverse the defeat, but often show confusion and mistakes. Therefore, it is not impossible for them to give up the championship to the Shenyang Military Region.

    篮球冠军属谁
    李英莲
    今天是篮球选拔赛的最后一天，第一场香港队对澳门队，第二场是这次选拔赛冠军的争夺战，联队对沈阳部队篮球队。
    第一场香港和澳门之战，必会引起观众们极大的兴趣。港澳两队队员个人技术都很好，动作细致而灵活，两三人的掩护和配合打得很巧妙，这两队相遇，别有风趣，一定会有许多精彩的表演。
    第二场冠军的争夺赛必然紧张、激烈。联队首战败于天津队，士气受挫，当天津队又败于公安军队时，联队情绪又转为高涨（因公安军队败于联队），大胜澳门队。在小组中，联队赢分最多，仍居小组第一位。联队本是一个实力较强的球队，队员身体条件较好，技术、战术也较全面，特别是后备力量雄厚，优于其他队，夺取冠军是颇有信心的。
    但是沈阳部队篮球队实力也并不差，在小组循环赛中，战绩辉煌，战胜北京队、沈阳队和香港队都在二十分或二十分以上，以极大的优势获得小组第一位。从这几场比赛的表现来看，全队配合熟练，快攻来的迅速，冲刺力强，阵地进攻也打得沉着，中距离投篮很准；此外，中距离投篮与个人突破的动作结合得也很好，进攻威力很大。
    联队篮球队虽有许多优越条件，但技术水平仍不够巩固，情绪易紧张和急躁，特别是在对方赢几分时，不能顽强而沉着地应战，以转败为胜，反而时常表现混乱失策，因此，把冠军让位给沈阳部队并不是毫无可能的。
