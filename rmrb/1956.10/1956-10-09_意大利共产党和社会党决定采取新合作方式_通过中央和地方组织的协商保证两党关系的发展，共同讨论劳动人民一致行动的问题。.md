　　Italian Communist Party and Socialist Party Decide to Adopt New Cooperative Methods
    Guarantee the development of relations between the two parties through consultations between central and local organizations, and jointly discuss the issue of united action by the working people.
    Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 8th. According to TASS, Rome, 7th: Representatives of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti and Amendola, and representatives of the Italian Socialist Party, Nenni and Pedini, held a meeting on October 4th and jointly drafted a document defining the new form of relationship between the Italian Communist Party and the Italian Socialist Party. This document has been approved by the leadership of the Italian Socialist Party and the secretariat of the Communist Party entrusted by the leadership of the Italian Communist Party, and has been published.
    The document states: "The Secretariat of the Italian Socialist Party and the Secretariat of the Italian Communist Party, entrusted by the leadership of the two parties, discussed the new forms of united policy that the working people should adopt due to changes in the situation. The relationship formed between the two parties over the years points out the foundations on which the current struggle to realize all the clauses of the constitution, to protect the vital interests of the working people, to strive for the country's economic development, and to strive for peace and the easing of international tensions should be based. The policy of unity and consensus of the working people is reflected here.
    "Both parties agree that changes in the situation require new ways of cooperation between the two parties, which will be different from those established under the Unity of Action Pact concluded in 1946. To this end, the two parties decided to guarantee the development of relations between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party through consultations between central and local organizations, and to jointly discuss the main issues of the working class and the united action of all working people."

　　意大利共产党和社会党决定采取新合作方式
    通过中央和地方组织的协商保证两党关系的发展，共同讨论劳动人民一致行动的问题。
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社罗马7日讯：意大利共产党代表陶里亚蒂和阿门多拉同意大利社会党代表南尼和裴丁尼在10月4日举行会议，联合拟定了一个确定意大利共产党和意大利社会党之间的新关系形式的文件。这个文件已经得到意大利社会党领导机构和受意大利共产党领导机构委托的共产党书记处的批准，并且加以公布。
    文件说：“意大利社会党书记处和意大利共产党书记处受两党领导机构的委托，讨论了关于劳动人民由于局势的变化所应采取的团结政策的新形式的问题。这些年来，两党形成的关系指出了目前争取实现宪法的一切条款、争取保护劳动人民的切身利益、争取国家的经济发展、争取和平和缓和国际紧张局势的斗争所应当依据的基础。劳动人民的团结一致的政策正是反映在这里。
    “两党一致认为，局势的变化要求两党之间有新的合作方式，这种合作方式将不同于根据1946年缔结的行动一致公约所建立的那些合作方式。为此，两党决定通过中央和地方组织的协商来保证社会党和共产党之间的关系的发展，共同讨论工人阶级的主要问题和全体劳动人民一致行动的问题。”
