    Opposing Subjectivism in Agricultural Technology Reform
    This year, many regions in our country have suffered from wind, flood, and drought disasters, but on a national scale, the main agricultural products can still be increased compared with last year. This is the result of correctly implementing technological reforms and other production-increasing measures on the basis of agricultural cooperation. If it were not for the harm of subjectivism in some areas, even greater achievements would have been made.
    After agricultural cooperation, the farmers' production enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly high, and there have been unprecedentedly favorable conditions for carrying out agricultural capital construction and promoting advanced agricultural technologies. However, some comrades who lead rural work have abused these favorable conditions and have adopted some practices that are divorced from reality and the masses in agricultural capital construction and agricultural technology reform. As a result, things went contrary to expectations, and there have been many phenomena of waste and reduced production. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the political report made on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Eighth National Congress: "Subjectivist errors still exist seriously in the minds and work of many of our cadres, causing many unnecessary losses to our work." The blind promotion of early japonica "Aomori No. 5" in Hunan Province, which resulted in a serious reduction in the production of many rice fields, is an example of this subjectivist ideology and work style causing unnecessary losses in agricultural production. (See page 3 of this newspaper today)
    Similar incidents of blindly promoting "Aomori No. 5" can be found in many regions. For example, blindly promoting dense planting regardless of soil, fertilizer, and variety conditions; forcibly promoting certain high-yield crops in areas where natural conditions are not suitable; hastily deciding to change the farming system without thorough investigation and research, etc. These practices have all had adverse consequences.
    Agricultural leaders generally know the policy of promoting technological reform; however, why do these errors occur? Judging from a large number of situations, the lack of relatively complete experience in leading large-scale production among rural cadres is indeed one of the reasons, but this is not the main reason; the fundamental reason lies in the subjective ideology and impetuousness of some leaders. This spring, after criticizing the right-leaning conservative thinking on the cooperative movement, rural workers in many places generally developed an impetuous mood. In the upsurge of production after agricultural cooperation, many of their thoughts and actions were divorced from objective reality. They insisted on achieving things in a short period of time that obviously required ten or eight years, or even more. According to possible conditions, production targets could obviously only be increased by a few percent, but they insisted on increasing them by several times within a year. In order to achieve these unrealistic plans, they had to take some inappropriate measures: forcibly promoting them without demonstration, rigidly stipulating planting tasks, blindly issuing instructions and decisions, and in some places even forcibly implementing so-called "technical operation regulations." Most of the production reduction incidents in many places this year occurred under these circumstances.
    Some comrades, when promoting certain projects of technological reform, have conducted key experiments and summarized practical experience, which were not conceived out of thin air. Why did they also commit subjectivist errors? Indeed, in actual work, there are very few people who openly and blindly act arbitrarily and stubbornly. Technological reforms are generally promoted after having considerable basis. However, the "basis" for increasing production effects obtained in small areas and under special conditions may not necessarily serve as the same "basis" on large areas of land and under general conditions. In the specific application of existing experience, or without better adapting to local conditions, or neglecting a specific factor, losses are often caused. This illustrates the complexity of technological reform and also shows that overcoming subjectivism cannot be effective simply by criticizing it. Only by earnestly adopting the working method of the mass line and a work style that goes deep into reality can subjectivism be effectively overcome.
    It can be seen from the process of some production reduction losses that the combination of subjectivist thinking and commandist work style has further aggravated the degree of loss. When those unsuitable plans and measures were put forward, some farmers and grassroots cadres had raised objections. If the leading cadres could listen to the opinions of the masses, strengthen investigation and research, and correct mistakes in time, some losses could be avoided. Unfortunately, leaders in many places did not do this. They forgot the principle that the masses can only be persuaded and not forced, and they also forgot the principle of consulting with the masses on matters. They always thought that their decisions were correct and had a basis; they always thought that the grassroots cadres and farmers did not accept it because of "conservative thinking." Under the big hat of "conservative thinking," I don't know how many correct opinions were frightened away.
    The promotion of technological reform must be active and not conservative. This is the established policy. If objective reality is possible, but it is not recognized, and no effort is made to turn the possible into reality, this is called conservatism, which is also a manifestation of subjectivism and should be opposed. However, if objective conditions are not fully assessed, and actions are taken only based on subjective wishes and individual cases, then good things will inevitably be done badly. Judging from the situation in this year's production, conservative thinking cannot be said to be absent; but in more cases, blind impetuousness occupies a dominant position. Some comrades do not specifically analyze the actual situation, and treat everything indiscriminately as "conservative thinking" for criticism, and use the facts of increased production under local and special conditions as a "powerful weapon" to criticize "conservative thinking," which makes their leadership even more divorced from reality.
    We lead production with good intentions for the people, and the masses understand this; however, because subjectivism has caused losses to the people, the masses cannot reduce their complaints because of "good intentions." A cooperative member in Jiangsu Province who suffered losses due to erroneous technological reforms said to the staff with tears in his eyes: "We know that you are also well-intentioned, but your methods are too reckless. You didn't try planting a little first, and you didn't discuss it properly with us ordinary people." In the era of small-scale peasant economy, individual farmers were both unable to carry out larger technological reforms and dared not easily try them, because a slight loss would threaten the livelihood of the whole family. Today, cooperatives have superior conditions for improving technology, and millions of members have placed their hopes of improving the lives of their families on the cooperatives; we should cherish the people's hopes and carry out technological reforms cautiously. Leading large-scale production, a slight carelessness can cause losses on millions of acres of large area, which is not only related to the livelihood of one family but also related to the livelihood of thousands of families.
    Comrade Mao Zedong has constantly warned us that subjectivism is a great enemy of the people, and we must constantly fight against the ideological style of subjectivism. Judging from the technological reform of agricultural production this year, the harm of this ideological style is indeed quite serious and widespread. In the past years of war, the ideological style of subjectivism sometimes would cost people their lives; today, committing subjectivist mistakes in production leadership will not kill people, but it will also cause a large amount of material losses and affect the lives of millions of people. Therefore, in socialist economic construction, eliminating the ideological style of subjectivism should be our constant combat task.
    When we look back and examine these facts, our main purpose is to gain experience and lessons; we cannot stop actively promoting technological reforms because there have been some deviations and errors in our actions. It should be seen that in the upsurge of production, many outdated production methods and production habits that hinder the development of production have been broken, and many high-yield and large-area high-yield records have appeared. These great achievements in production technology reform should be affirmed. Correcting mistakes on the basis of affirming achievements will prevent us from deviating to the other side after correcting this mistake.

### 反对农业技术改革中的主观主义

    反对农业技术改革中的主观主义
    今年我国许多地区遭受了风灾、水灾和旱灾，而就全国范围来说，主要农产品还能比去年增产。这是在农业合作化的基础上正确地推行了技术改革和其它增产措施的结果。如果不是某些地区受了主观主义之害，还会做出更大的成绩。
    农业合作化以后，农民的生产情绪空前高涨，在进行农业基本建设和推行农业先进技术方面有了空前有利的条件。但是，一些领导农村工作的同志滥用了这些有利条件，在农业基本建设和农业技术改革方面采取了一些脱离实际、脱离群众的做法。以致事与愿违，出现了不少浪费和减产的现象。正如刘少奇同志代表中共中央委员会向第八次全国代表大会所作的政治报告中指出的：“主观主义的错误在目前我们许多干部的思想上和工作中仍然严重地存在着，使我们的工作受到许多不应有的损失”。湖南省盲目推广早粳“青森五号”以致许多稻田严重减产，正是这种主观主义思想作风在农业生产上造成了不应有的损失的一个事例。（见今天本报第三版）
    类似盲目推广“青森五号”的事情，在不少地区也可以找到。如不顾土壤、肥料、品种等条件，盲目推广密植；在自然条件不适合的地区，硬性推广某种高产作物；不经周密调查研究，草率决定改变耕作制度等等。这些作法，都发生了不良的后果。
    推行技术改革的方针，农业领导干部一般地都是知道的；可是，为什么又会发生这些错误呢？从大量的情况看，农村干部还缺乏领导大生产的比较完整的经验，固然是原因之一，但这并不是主要的；根本的原因还在于某些领导人员主观主义的思想作风和急躁情绪。今年春季，不少地方的农村工作人员，在批判了对合作化运动的右倾保守思想之后，较为普遍地又产生了一种急躁情绪。在农业合作化以后的生产高潮中，他们的许多思想行动脱离了客观实际。明明是十年八年甚至更多的时间才能办到的事，他们硬要在短时间内达到。根据可能条件，产量指标明明只能提高几成，他们硬要一年之内就提高几倍。为了实现这些不切实际的计划，他们就不得不采取一些不适当的措施：不经示范强迫推广，硬性规定种植任务，盲目发布指示决定，有些地方还强硬推行所谓“技术操作规程”。今年许多地方的减产事件，大都是在这种情形下发生的。
    有些同志在推行技术改革的某些项目的时候，进行过重点试验，总结了实际经验，并不是从脑子里凭空想出来的，为什么也犯了主观主义的错误呢？确实是这样，在实际工作中，明目张胆、主观蛮干、一意孤行的人，毕竟是极少数，对于技术改革一般都是有了相当根据才推行的。但是，小面积的、特殊条件下得到增产效果的“根据”，在大面积土地上、一般条件下未必就同样可以作为“根据”。在具体运用已有的经验的时候，或是没有更好地因地制宜，或是忽略了某一个具体因素，也常常会造成损失。这说明技术改革的复杂性，也说明克服主观主义并不是批判一通就准能奏效的。只有认真采取群众路线的工作方法和深入实际的工作作风，才能确实有效地克服主观主义。
    从一些造成减产损失的经过中可以看出：主观主义思想和命令主义作风结合起来，就更加重了损失的程度。当那些不适宜的计划和措施提出的时候，有些农民和基层干部是曾经提出过反对意见的。如果领导干部能倾听群众意见，加强调查研究，及时修正错误，就可以避免一些损失。可惜，许多地方的领导者并没有这样作。他们忘掉了对群众只能说服不能强迫的原则，也忘记了有事和群众商量的原则，总以为自己的决定是对的，是有根据的；总以为基层干部和农民不接受，是有“保守思想”作怪。在“保守思想”的大帽子下，不知吓退了多少正确的意见。
    推行技术改革必须是积极的，不能保守，这是既定的方针。如果客观实际有可能，却认识不到这种实际情况，不去努力把可能变成现实，这叫做保守，这也是主观主义的一种表现，是应该反对的。可是，如果不全面地估计客观条件，只凭主观愿望和个别事例行事，那就必然会把好事办坏。从今年生产中的情况看，保守思想也不能说没有；但在更多的场合，盲目急躁情绪却占着支配地位。有些同志不具体分析实际情况，把一切都笼统地当作“保守思想”来批判，并且把局部的特殊条件下的增产事实当作批判“保守思想”的“有力武器”，这就使他们的领导更加远离实际。
    我们领导生产是好心好意为着人民，这一点群众是理解的；但是，由于主观主义给人民造成了损失，群众却不能因为“心好”而稍减其埋怨情绪。江苏省有一个因错误的技术改革而遭受损失的社员含着泪向工作人员说：“我们知道你们也是好心，可是你们的干法太莽撞了，也不先少种一些试试，也不和咱老百姓好好商量商量。”在小农经济时代，个体农民一方面无力进行较大的技术改革，另一方面他们也不敢轻易尝试，因为稍有损失，一家老小的生计就会受到威胁。今天，合作社具备了改进技术的优越条件，千百万社员都把改善一家人生活的希望寄托给合作社；我们就更应该珍重人民的希望，谨慎地进行技术改革。领导大生产，偶一不慎，就会在千万亩大面积上造成损失，那就不只是关系一家而是关系着千百家的生计。
    毛泽东同志曾不断地告诫我们：主观主义是人民的大敌，我们要不断地对主观主义的思想作风作斗争。从今年农业生产技术改革上看，这种思想作风的危害确是相当严重而普遍的。在过去战争的年代，主观主义的思想作风有时会葬送人的生命；今天在生产领导方面犯主观主义的毛病，虽然不会死人，但也会造成大量的物质损失，影响到千万人民的生活。因此，在社会主义经济建设中，肃清主观主义思想作风，应该是我们经常的战斗任务。
    当我们回顾和检查这些事实的时候，我们的目的主要是在于取得经验教训；不能因为行动中出了一些偏差和错误，就不再积极推行技术改革。应该看到，在生产高潮中，许多阻碍生产发展的陈旧的生产方法和生产习惯被打破了，许多高额丰产和大面积丰产记录出现了。这些生产技术改革上的伟大成果，是应该加以肯定的。在肯定成绩的基础上纠正错误，才不至于纠正这一错误之后又偏到另一边去。
