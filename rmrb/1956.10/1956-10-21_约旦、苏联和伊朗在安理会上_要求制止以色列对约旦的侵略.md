Xinhua News Agency, New York, 20th -- According to TASS, New York, on the 19th, the Security Council began discussing Jordan's complaint regarding Israel's recent armed attacks against Jordan.

    Jordanian representative Rifai spoke first at the meeting. He listed facts illustrating numerous recent Israeli military violations of Jordanian territory. These violations not only caused a large number of Jordanian civilian deaths and significant material losses but, more importantly, threatened peace and security in the Near East.

    Rifai said that the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization's investigations proved that Israel's actions were unjustified. He asked the Security Council to note that Israel's refusal to cooperate with the UN Truce Supervision Organization during investigations of border incidents demonstrates that Israel has disregarded the Jordanian-Israeli armistice agreement.

    The Jordanian representative pointed out that the purpose of the Israeli armed forces' attack on Jordan was to weaken the joint efforts of Arab countries aimed at a peaceful resolution of the Suez issue. At the same time, it also attempted to benefit from the policies of certain countries related to the Palestine issue.

    The Jordanian representative requested the Security Council to take effective measures to stop Israel's policy and activities of aggression against neighboring countries. He appealed to the Council to apply Article 41 of the United Nations Charter to impose sanctions on Israel.

    Israeli representative Kidron spoke next, limiting his remarks to a simple denial of Israel's responsibility for military violations against Jordan, insisting that the entire fault lay with Jordan's policies toward Israel.

    British representative Dixon expressed regret over the deterioration of the Jordanian-Israeli situation and reserved the right to speak later when discussing the substance of the matter.

    The Iranian representative said that the recent actions of the Israeli army against Jordan were a kind of unwarranted and obvious aggression. The Security Council should discuss appropriate measures to maintain order and security in the region.

    Soviet representative Sobolev then delivered preliminary opinions. He pointed out that the recent acts of aggression launched by the Israeli side proved the serious deterioration of the situation in the demarcation line area between Israel and Jordan. Existing materials irrefutably show that Israel deliberately undermined the armistice agreement with Jordan, violated the relevant agreements of the Security Council, and disregarded the obligations undertaken in negotiations with the United Nations Secretary-General to implement Security Council Resolution 4, 1956.

    The Soviet representative said that the serious situation occurring on the Israeli-Jordanian military demarcation line could easily develop into a threat to peace in the Middle East, a situation that requires strong intervention by the Security Council. The Security Council must take effective measures to stop Israel's frequent violations of the armistice agreement and Security Council resolutions.

    The Security Council meeting adjourned at this point. The Security Council will continue to discuss the Jordanian complaint case early next week. The Security Council will also discuss Israel's complaint against Jordan, which was included on the Security Council's agenda based on a letter from the Israeli delegation on October 17.

### 约旦、苏联和伊朗在安理会上  要求制止以色列对约旦的侵略

    约旦、苏联和伊朗在安理会上
    要求制止以色列对约旦的侵略
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社纽约20日讯：安全理事会19日开始讨论约旦对以色列最近武装攻击约旦的控诉。
    约旦代表里法伊首先在会议上发言。他列举事实说明以色列军队最近对约旦领土的许多次侵犯，这些侵犯不仅使约旦平民大量死亡，使他们遭到重大物质损失，更重要的是它威胁到近东的和平和安全。
    里法伊说，联合国停战监察组织的调查证明，以色列的这种行动是没有理由的。他要求安理会注意：在联合国停战监察组织调查边界事件的时候，以色列拒绝同它合作，这就说明，以色列已经把约旦和以色列的停战协定弃置不顾了。
    约旦代表指出，以色列武装部队进攻约旦的目的是企图削弱阿拉伯国家旨在和平解决苏伊士问题的共同努力。同时，它还企图从同巴勒斯坦问题有关的某些国家的政策中得到好处。
    约旦代表要求安理会采取有效措施来制止以色列对邻国的侵略政策和活动。他吁请理事会应用联合国宪章第四十一条制裁以色列。
    以色列代表基德隆接着发言，他的发言仅限于简单地否认以色列军队侵犯约旦的责任，硬说全部过错都在于约旦对以色列的政策。
    英国代表狄克逊对约旦—以色列局势的恶化表示遗憾，并且保留在以后讨论问题的实质时发言的权利。
    伊朗代表说，以色列军队最近的反约旦行为是某种无端的明显的侵略。安全理事会应当讨论为了保持这个区域的秩序和安全而应该采取的相应措施。
    苏联代表索波列夫接着发表了初步意见。他指出，以色列方面在最近发动的侵略行动证明了以色列和约旦之间分界线地区局势的严重恶化。现有材料无可争辩地表明，以色列有意破坏同约旦的停战协定、破坏安理会的有关协议以及在同联合国秘书长为执行安理会1956年4月4日决议而进行的谈判时所承担的义务。
    苏联代表说，以色列—约旦军事分界线上所发生的严重情况很容易发展为对中东和平的威胁，这种情况要求安理会大力干预。安理会必须采取有效措施终止以色列经常破坏停战协定和安理会决议的行动。
    安理会会议到此休会。安理会在下星期初将继续讨论约旦控诉案。安理会还将讨论以色列对约旦的控诉案，这件控诉案是根据以色列代表团10月17日来信而列入安理会议程的。
