　　A large quantity of more than 370 tons of non-staple foods such as live pigs, cured meat, egg powder, pastries, and canned goods, purchased by the Qinghai Provincial Food Company and Trade Company respectively, and more than 174,000 pieces of cotton, leather, and woolen clothing, will be shipped to the Qaidam Basin in succession.

　　In order to ensure that the personnel exploring the Qaidam Basin can eat fresh meat and various non-staple foods, the Qinghai Provincial Food Company sent purchasing personnel to Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Hankou, Sichuan and other places to organize supplies, and also went deep into the agricultural areas of Qinghai Province to purchase large quantities of live pigs.

　　As early as April and May of this year, the Qinghai Provincial Trade Company signed supply contracts with four fur factories in Dalian, Jinzhou, Datong, and Zhangjiakou. The workers of these four factories, in order to support the people working in the Qaidam area, worked day and night to rush to make this batch of clothes. Recently, the deputy director of the Datong Fur Factory and the head of the supply and sales section of the Jinzhou Fur Factory have personally gone to the Qaidam Basin to understand the opinions of the exploration personnel on the specifications and quality of this batch of cotton and leather clothing, so as to improve the products in the future.

    大批副食品和寒衣运往柴达木盆地
    本报讯　青海省食品公司和贸易公司分别采购的生猪、腊肉、蛋粉、糕点、罐头等三百七十多吨副食品，和十七万四千多件棉、皮、毛服装，即将陆续运往柴达木盆地。
    为了使在柴达木盆地勘探的人员能吃到新鲜的肉和各种副食品，青海省食品公司曾派出采购人员分赴上海、南京、天津、汉口、四川等地组织货源，也深入青海省农业区大量收购生猪。
    青海省贸易公司早在今年四五月间，就先后同大连、锦州、大同、张家口等四个皮毛厂签订了供应合同。这四个厂的职工们，为了支援在柴达木地区工作的人们，曾夜以继日地赶制这批衣服。最近，大同皮毛厂副厂长和锦州皮毛厂供销股股长等，都亲自到柴达木盆地去了解勘探人员对这批棉皮服装的规格、质量的意见，以便今后改进产品。（青地）
