Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The joint field survey and exploration work conducted this year by the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Heilongjiang Comprehensive Survey Team and the Soviet Academy of Sciences' Heilongjiang Comprehensive Survey Team has come to a close, with significant achievements.

	In terms of water conservancy and hydropower, experts have completed the survey of the Ergun River's water resources this year and re-examined the Heilongjiang River's middle and upper reaches' water resources and cascade development plans. Experts also studied the planning schemes for major tributaries of the Ussuri River, such as the Iman River, Bikin River, and Mudan River, as well as the possibility of hydropower development on the Suifen River. During the survey, Chinese experts learned from Soviet experts methods for measuring river hydropower with less manpower and time. Chinese scientists pointed out that this is beneficial for China to accurately ascertain the country's hydropower resources with less manpower in a shorter period of time.

	Geological survey experts have also made preliminary achievements in the geological composition survey and mineral deposit exploration in the Greater Khingan and Lesser Khingan Mountains within both Chinese and Soviet territories. Geological experts are very interested in the mineralization phenomena discovered in certain areas of these regions, believing that these areas may contain iron ore and non-ferrous metal deposits of considerable scale, warranting further in-depth investigation and research.

	Experts studying natural conditions and soil have surveyed agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry resources in the middle and upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River and the Hulunbuir region this year, studying issues such as the development of animal husbandry, soil improvement, and the utilization of agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry resources in these areas.

	A total of more than 150 experts and staff from the Chinese and Soviet sides participated in this survey. They began the survey work in China and the Soviet Union, according to the agreement signed on August 18th in Beijing between China and the Soviet Union on the joint investigation and comprehensive utilization of the natural resources of the Heilongjiang River basin. The survey work was carried out in a spirit of high internationalism and close unity between Chinese and Soviet scientists.

	According to the agreement, the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Heilongjiang Comprehensive Survey Team will expand the scope of its survey in the next two to three years. In addition to continuing to cooperate with Soviet survey experts to investigate the Heilongjiang River, Ussuri River, and other water systems for water conservancy, hydropower, and other resources, the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Heilongjiang Comprehensive Survey Team is also preparing to conduct independent surveys within China to study and formulate plans for the Songhua River basin; conduct geological surveys and general surveys in areas such as the Greater Khingan Mountains, Lesser Khingan Mountains, Wanda Mountains, and Changbai Mountains; study the land resource development of swampy areas, saline-alkali areas, and the Hulunbuir grasslands near the confluence of the Heilongjiang River, Ussuri River, and Songhua River; and will also study the Songliao Canal, which is of great significance to the development of the national economy, and the Liaoning River basin planning.

    黑龙江资源吸引了中苏科学家
    今年的野外考察和勘察工作有了很大成绩
    新华社27日讯　中国科学院黑龙江综合考察队同苏联科学院黑龙江综合考察队今年共同进行的野外考察和勘测工作已经告一段落，今年的工作有了很大的成绩。
    在水利水能方面，今年专家们已经完成了对额尔古纳河水利资源的考察，并且复查了黑龙江中、上游的水利资源和梯级开发方案。专家们还研究了乌苏里江各大支流如伊曼河、毕肯河、穆棱河的规划方案以及绥芬河水力开发的可能性。在考察工作中，中国专家向苏联专家学习了用比较少的人力和时间测定河流水能的方法。中国科学家们指出，这对于中国在较短时间内，以较少的人力，比较正确地查明全国水能资源，是有好处的。
    地质考察专家在大兴安岭和小兴安岭地区的中、苏两国境内进行的地质构成考察和矿藏考察也取得了初步成效。地质专家们对在上述地区中某些地方发现的矿化现象很感兴趣，他们认为这些地区可能蕴藏有规模不小的铁矿和有色金属矿，值得进一步深入考察和研究。
    研究自然条件及土壤的专家，今年考察了黑龙江中、上游以及呼伦贝尔地区的农、林、牧业资源，对于这些地区的牧业发展和土壤改良以及农、林、牧业资源的利用等问题进行了研究。
    中国方面和苏联方面参加这次考察工作的专家和工作人员共有一百五十多人。他们根据今年8月18日中国和苏联在北京签定的共同调查和综合利用黑龙江流域的自然资源的协定，在中、苏两国境内开始了考察工作。考察工作是在高度的国际主义精神和中、苏科学家亲密团结的气氛中进行的。
    根据协定，中国科学院黑龙江综合考察队将在今后两、三年中扩大考察的范围。中国科学院黑龙江综合考察队除了继续同苏联考察专家合作，对黑龙江、乌苏里江等水系进行水利水能以及其他资源的考察以外，还准备在中国境内独立进行考察，研究和拟制松花江流域规划；对大兴安岭、小兴安岭、完达山、长白山等区域进行地质测量和普查；研究黑龙江、乌苏里江、松花江汇合点附近的沼泽地区、盐碱地区和呼伦贝尔草原等地的土地资源开垦问题；并且将研究对国民经济的发展有重大意义的松辽运河以及辽河流域规划等问题。
