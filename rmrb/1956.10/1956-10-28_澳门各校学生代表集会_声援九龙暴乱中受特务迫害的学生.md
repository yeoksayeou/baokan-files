Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 27th. Hong Kong Dispatch: The Macau Chinese Students' Union invited student representatives from various schools in Macau to a forum on the Kowloon riots on the 25th. At the meeting, students from various schools spoke out, expressing their indignation at the crimes of the Kuomintang special agents who sabotaged the six middle and primary schools, including "Heung To," "Tai Wah," "Lung Shing," "Sun Wah," "Ki Ching," and "Cheung Kong" in Kowloon. They demanded that the British authorities in Hong Kong earnestly take responsibility, severely punish the instigators of the riots, ensure the safety of life and property of the residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon, and promptly take measures to provide relief to the dead and wounded and handle the aftermath.

The forum also passed a letter of condolence from the Macau Student Union to the students in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The letter stated: "Kuomintang special agents took advantage of the anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution to create shocking and inhumane atrocities in Kowloon, setting fires, looting, raping and killing compatriots in a planned, organized, and premeditated manner. All students in Macau are filled with righteous indignation and feel extremely angry at this heinous crime! In this riot, the normal study life of students in Hong Kong and Kowloon was severely disrupted, and the new school building of Heung To Middle School and Tai Wah Primary School were completely burned down, resulting in heavy losses. Students from various schools in Macau express their deep concern for the students in Hong Kong and Kowloon and extend their sincere condolences."

The letter also stated: "This Kowloon incident thoroughly exposed the ferocious and evil faces of the Kuomintang special agents, fully demonstrating that they are at the end of their rope. In order to carry out their final desperate struggle, they do not hesitate to adopt the most cruel and despicable means to deal with the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, but they will inevitably suffer the consequences of their actions. In addition to unanimously condemning the crimes of the Kuomintang special agents, we students in Macau express our strong dissatisfaction with the Hong Kong British authorities for not taking decisive measures to stop the riots and for condoning the Kuomintang special agents' recklessness. The Hong Kong police did not fulfill their responsibility to protect the lives and property of residents when the riots occurred, but afterwards unreasonably searched units such as the Motorcycle Workers' Children's School. We firmly oppose this measure by the Hong Kong British authorities. We believe that the Hong Kong British authorities must earnestly take responsibility, severely punish the culprits, and resolutely take the responsibility of promptly handling the aftermath for the compatriots who have been harmed in the riots."

    澳门各校学生代表集会
    声援九龙暴乱中受特务迫害的学生
    新华社广州27日电　香港消息：澳门中华学生联合总会25日就九龙暴乱事件邀集澳门各学校学生代表举行座谈会。会上各校同学纷纷发言，对国民党特务分子破坏九龙“香岛”、“大华”、“龙城”、“新华”、“基青”和“长江”等六家中、小学校的罪行表示愤慨，并要求香港英国当局切实负起责任，严惩暴乱祸首，保障港九居民生命财产安全，并迅速采取措施，恤死扶伤，办理善后。
    座谈会还通过了澳门学联致港九同学的慰问信。这封慰问信里说：“国民党特务分子利用辛亥革命纪念日在九龙制造了骇人听闻、灭绝人性的暴行，有计划、有组织、有预谋地纵火行劫、奸杀同胞，这种滔天罪行，全澳同学闻之莫不切齿痛恨，感到极大的愤慨！在这次暴乱中，港九同学的正常学习生活受到严重的破坏，香岛中学新校舍、大华小学全被焚毁，损失惨重。澳门各校同学对港九同学这次遭遇表示深切关怀，并致亲切的慰问。”
    慰问信又说：“这次九龙事件彻底暴露了国民党特务分子穷凶极恶的狰狞面目，充分证明了他们正处于穷途末路的地步，他们为了进行最后的垂死挣扎，不惜采取最残酷、最卑劣的手段来对付港九同胞，但是，他们将必自食恶果。我们澳门同学除一致痛斥国民党特务分子的罪行外，对香港英国当局没有采取坚决的措施制止暴乱和纵容国民党特务分子胡作妄为的态度，表示非常不满。香港警方在暴乱发生时没有负起保护居民生命财产之责，事后却无理搜查摩托车劳工子弟学校等单位，我们对香港英国当局这一措施，坚决表示反对，我们认为：香港英国当局必须切实负起责任，严惩祸首，对在暴乱中受到损害的同胞，必须坚决负起迅速办理善后之责。”
