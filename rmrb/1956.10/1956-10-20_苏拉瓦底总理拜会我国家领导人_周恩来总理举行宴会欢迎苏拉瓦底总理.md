In his speech welcoming Prime Minister Suhrawardy and other distinguished Pakistani guests, Premier Zhou Enlai said that we are pleased to see that since taking office, His Excellency Suhrawardy, on behalf of the Pakistani government, has expressed the hope to be friendly with all countries, especially neighboring countries, to be benevolent to all countries, and to harbor no malice towards anyone. Premier Zhou welcomed this important statement by Prime Minister Suhrawardy and pointed out that although China and Pakistan have different social systems and different views on certain international affairs, both countries agree with the ten principles adopted by the historic Bandung Conference.

Prime Minister Suhrawardy pointed out that peace is a prerequisite for progress, and Pakistan will unswervingly continue to strive for the cause of peace, because without peace, no social, economic, or cultural welfare plan can succeed.

At the end of the speeches by Premier Zhou and Prime Minister Suhrawardy, the guests stood up and toasted to the friendship between China and Pakistan, to the unity of Asian and African countries, to world peace, and to the health of President Mirza and Chairman Mao Zedong.

Finally, Prime Minister Suhrawardy raised his glass and said, "I bring the friendship of the Pakistani people to the Chinese people. Please join me in a toast to our friendship and peace."

Prime Minister Suhrawardy and his entourage also carefully viewed the ancient works of art in the Hall of Supreme Harmony and the important unearthed cultural relics from five provinces in the Hall of Preserving Harmony. The twelve ivory carvings of "Monthly Pleasures" from the 18th century attracted the Prime Minister's attention for a long time. He said that these carvings were very exquisite.
