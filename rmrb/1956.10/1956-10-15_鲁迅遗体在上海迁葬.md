Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 14th: Lu Xun's remains were reburied in Shanghai today.

Before the reburial ceremony, Lu Xun's former comrades-in-arms, including Mao Dun, Zhou Yang, Xu Guangping, Ba Jin, and Jin Yi, went to the International Cemetery to lift the coffin. Ba Jin and Jin Zhonghua solemnly covered Lu Xun's coffin with a red flag sewn with the black characters "National Soul." This was made according to the flag presented by the people of Shanghai at Lu Xun's burial twenty years ago.

At 9:00 a.m., the reburial ceremony began. Amidst mournful music, Song Qingling, Mao Dun, Ke Qingshi, Zhou Yang, Xu Guangping, Jin Zhonghua, Zhong Min, Li Qitao, Ba Jin, Jin Yi, and Tang Tao, eleven in total, slowly carried the coffin from the entrance of Hongkou Park towards the burial site.

The magnificent new tomb site was filled with flowers and wreaths sent by people from all walks of life. Five large wreaths presented by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the State Council, and Song Qingling were placed in front of the tombstone.

The pallbearers carried the coffin onto the lowering frame in the burial pit. As the coffin was lowered into the grave, everyone present stood in silent tribute.

Ba Jin reported the process of preparing for the relocation of the tomb in front of the grave. Then Mao Dun and Xu Guangping spoke.

Mao Dun said: Among the comrades present today, many participated in the funeral twenty years ago. Twenty years ago, many of us hoped to rebuild Lu Xun's tomb to match his noble personality. Now this hope has become a reality!

Xu Guangping said: In the future, we will definitely fulfill and carry forward Lu Xun's wishes, build a new China, unite all forces that can be united, and persevere in the struggle for a friendly, cooperative, and harmonious family of mankind, and continue to move forward!

At 9:40 a.m., the reburial ceremony concluded after the tomb was sealed.

Subsequently, Jin Zhonghua, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, unveiled the curtain in front of Lu Xun's statue at the tomb.

Nearly two thousand people attended today's reburial ceremony, including leaders from Party and government departments, writers, workers, students, and foreign diplomats stationed in Shanghai. Lu Xun's beloved son, Hai Ying, and Hai Ying's wife, as well as Lu Xun's grandchildren, also attended the funeral.

    新华社上海14日电　鲁迅的遗体，今天在上海迁葬。
    迁葬仪式举行以前，鲁迅生前的战友茅盾、周扬、许广平、巴金、靳以等十人到万国公墓起灵。巴金和金仲华庄严地把一面缝着黑字的“民族魂”红旗复盖在鲁迅先生的灵柩上，这是按照二十年前鲁迅先生安葬时上海民众献的旗子制成的。
    上午九时，迁葬仪式开始，在哀乐声中，宋庆龄、茅盾、柯庆施、周扬、许广平、金仲华、钟民、李琦涛、巴金、靳以和唐弢等十一人扶着灵柩、从虹口公园大门口徐徐向墓地进发。

    灵柩由扶柩人抬到墓穴的落葬架上。当灵柩落入穴中的时候，在场的人都肃立致哀。
    巴金在墓前报告了筹备迁墓的经过。接着茅盾和许广平讲话。
    茅盾说：今天在场的同志们中间有不少是参加过二十年前的葬仪的。二十年前，我们许多人，都希望把鲁迅坟墓改建得和他的崇高的人格相称。现在这希望成为事实了！
    许广平说：我们今后一定会完成和发扬鲁迅的意愿，来建设新中国，团结一切可以团结的力量，为人类友好合作的、和睦的大家庭而坚持奋斗，不断地前进！
    九时四十分，迁葬仪式在封墓以后结束。
    接着，上海市副市长金仲华揭开了墓前的鲁迅雕像前的幕布。
    参加今天迁葬仪式的有党和政府部门的负责人、作家、工人、学生和各国驻上海的外交人员近两千人。鲁迅先生的爱子海婴和海婴夫人，以及鲁迅先生的孙儿也参加了葬仪。
