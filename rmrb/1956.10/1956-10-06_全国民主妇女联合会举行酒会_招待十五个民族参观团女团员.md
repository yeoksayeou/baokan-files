Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The All-China Women's Federation held a reception this evening to welcome all members of the Tibetan Women's Visiting Group and female members of the other fourteen ethnic minority visiting groups.

    Cai Chang, President of the All-China Women's Federation, first extended a warm welcome on behalf of the Federation to the sisters of all ethnic groups present, and congratulated them on their achievements in participating in the socialist construction of the motherland. She said that today, more than two hundred and eighty sisters from eighteen ethnic groups from the remote northwest and southwest of the motherland are gathering here intimately, symbolizing the great unity of sisters of all ethnic groups across the country. She hoped that through visits and mutual learning of the visiting groups in various places, they will be able to better unite the sisters of all ethnic groups after returning, actively participate in local construction undertakings, and carry out women and children's welfare work.

    The reception was held in an elegant hall of the Xinqiao Hotel. Sisters from eighteen ethnic groups across the country happily chatted with representatives of women from all walks of life in the capital. Everyone repeatedly rose to toast to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, to the close unity between sisters of all ethnic groups, and to the building of a prosperous and strong socialist motherland.

    At the reception, women of all ethnic groups happily sang songs. At the end, they also danced the Yangko together.

    Before the reception, a female member of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region visiting group presented a gift to Cai Chang on behalf of the women of Xinjiang.
