    Yiyang City, Hunan Province Readjusts Industry-Commerce Relations
    Industrial and Handicraft Production Improves
    (Our Dispatch) Yiyang City, Hunan Province, has resolved several prominent issues that have long existed in industry-commerce relations. In the past, commercial profits were too high in processing and ordering, while production units' profits were too low, even resulting in losses. Yiyang is located near bamboo, wood, and palm producing areas, but because commercial departments did not pay attention to arranging local production and mostly organized sales to other places, the production of bamboo and wood products and palm ropes was in a state of shutdown or reduced production due to a lack of raw materials, causing many joint venture factories and handicraft production cooperatives to lose money.
    The Yiyang City Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conducted in-depth investigations and research on these issues, organized consultations with relevant parties, and, based on the regulations of the Hunan Provincial Committee, adjusted industry-commerce profits. For industrial and handicraft enterprises that were losing money, commercial departments returned a portion of the excessive profits to maintain production and workers' livelihoods; at the same time, factories were given a deadline of six months to actively improve production. Currently, commercial departments have supplied sufficient raw materials to industrial and handicraft departments, and the original regulations prohibiting production departments from freely purchasing raw materials and selling leftover materials on the market have been abolished, allowing production units to select and purchase materials. The phenomenon of commercial departments deliberately making things difficult for industrial departments in commodity inspection has also been changed, and it is stipulated that, in the future, except for products that are prone to deterioration or deformation, which will still be inspected by commercial departments, other products will be inspected by the factories or cooperatives themselves, stamped with the brand name, and held responsible to the end. At the same time, the Municipal Party Committee also requires industrial and handicraft departments to work hard to improve business management, improve product quality, reduce costs, and reverse the backward state of affairs.
    At present, the industrial and handicraft production situation in Yiyang City has greatly improved. Most of the handicraft cooperatives now have sufficient production tasks and raw materials. The palm rope handicraft production cooperative, which had been shut down for nearly two months due to the commercial department's failure to supply palm fibers, saw an increase in workers' income of nearly 56% compared to the second quarter. After the hat-making cooperative had production tasks, the average worker's income increased from 22.12 yuan to 43.15 yuan.

### 湖南省益阳市调整工商关系  工业和手工业生产情况好转

    湖南省益阳市调整工商关系
    工业和手工业生产情况好转
    本报讯　湖南省益阳市解决了工商关系中长期存在的几个突出问题。过去，在加工订货中，商业利润太高，生产单位利润太低，甚至亏本。益阳靠近竹木棕产地，由于商业部门不注意安排当地的生产，大部组织外销，使竹木器和棕绳的生产因缺乏原料而处于停工或减产的困境，好些合营工厂和手工业生产合作社亏了本。
    中共益阳市委就这些问题作了深入调查研究，组织有关方面磋商，根据湖南省委的规定，调整了工商利润。工业和手工业亏本的，商业部门退还一部分过多的利润，以维持生产和工人的生计；同时限厂方在半年内积极改进生产。目前商业部门已向工业和手工业部门供给足够的原材料，并取消了原来禁止生产部门在市场上自由购买原料和出售残料的规定，允许生产单位选购。过去在检验商品上刁难工业部门的现象也都改变了，并且规定今后除容易变质变形的产品仍由商业部门验收外，其他产品均由厂方或合作社自己负责验收，盖上牌号负责到底。同时市委也要求工业和手工业部门努力改进经营管理，提高产品质量，降低成本，扭转落后状态。
    目前，益阳市工业和手工业生产情况已大有好转，绝大部分手工业合作社已有足够的生产任务和原材料，曾因商业部门不供应棕片而一度停工近二月的棕绳手工业生产合作社，工人收入比二季度增长近56％，制帽社有了生产任务后，工人平均收入由二十二元一角二分增加到四十三元一角五分。
