    To Fundamentally Eradicate Waterlogging Disasters in the Huaibei Region
    Anhui Province Plans a Governance Program Combining "Three Agricultural Reforms"
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Anhui Province will adopt new measures to fundamentally address waterlogging disasters in the Huaibei region.
    These new measures to control waterlogging will focus primarily on "water storage." On high ground, ditches and terraced fields will be created for on-site water storage, reducing surface runoff towards low-lying areas. In low-lying areas, embankments will be built for rice cultivation, and in permanently waterlogged areas, ponds will be dug for lotus planting and fish farming. Simultaneously, river dredging and regulation projects and the establishment of drainage systems will be carried out. These measures were formulated by the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party after a detailed study of the severe waterlogging disaster suffered by the Huaibei region this year.
    In recent years, the Huai River project has played a significant role in preventing waterlogging disasters. However, the measures taken in the past focused primarily on "drainage." During the flood season, the Huai River's water flow is very high, and the water level in the middle reaches is generally more than one meter higher than the surrounding flatlands outside the dikes. In addition, three-quarters of the rainwater from the 45 million mu of farmland in the Huaibei Plain also flows into the Huai River (the remainder flows into Hongze Lake). Consequently, these tributaries leading to the Huai River, even after dredging, are still affected by the backwater effect of the Huai River after heavy rains, causing river water to accumulate in the low-lying areas along the Huai River and fail to drain, resulting in waterlogging disasters. During this year's flood season, the dikes of the main stream and major tributaries of the Huai River did not breach, but several million mu of farmland in the Huaibei region were still affected by the disaster for this very reason.
    Currently, measures to lower the water level of the Huai River's main stream cannot be realized in the short term. The Huai River Commission and the Anhui Provincial Water Conservancy Department, based on the instructions of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and in conjunction with the Bengbu and Fuyang Special Districts, have jointly formulated a waterlogging control plan that combines "Three Agricultural Reforms." This plan requires that, starting from this winter and next spring, the Huaibei region should strive to eliminate waterlogging disasters of the 1956 type in approximately five years. In years with normal rainfall, all enclosed areas, except for permanently waterlogged areas, should have the conditions to achieve a bumper harvest.
    This year, the successful planting of early rice as a double-cropping rice crop in Huaibei has once again been achieved. This shows that the soil and rainfall in the Huaibei region are suitable for growing rice. The problem lies in how to gradually change the farming habits of the vast number of farmers and teach them the techniques of embankment construction, terraced field creation, and rice cultivation. The agricultural and water conservancy departments of Anhui Province attach great importance to embankment construction and are currently stepping up the training of cadres and allocating manpower. It is expected that the embankment construction projects in various counties will be able to commence by the end of October and the beginning of November. The relevant river dredging and construction of culverts, sluices, and bridges will also be planned and designed uniformly by the Huai River Commission, and construction will begin this winter.

### 根治淮北地区内涝灾害  安徽省拟定同农业三改结合的治涝方案

    根治淮北地区内涝灾害
    安徽省拟定同农业三改结合的治涝方案
    据新华社讯　安徽省将采取新的措施来根本治理淮北地区的内涝灾害。
    这些治理涝灾的新措施，是以“蓄水”为主。在高地做好沟洫畦田就地蓄水，以减少地面流水向洼地集中；洼地、筑圩改种水稻，死洼地区挖塘栽藕养鱼；同时结合进行河道的疏浚整理工程和建立排水系统。上述这些措施是中共安徽省委详细研究了今年淮北地区遭受严重涝灾的情况后制定出来的。
    几年来，治淮工程在免除涝灾方面起了很大作用。但过去采取的措施是以“排水”为主，到了汛期，淮河河水来量很大，中游水位一般都比堤外平地高出一公尺以上；另外，淮北平原四千五百万亩农田的雨水，有四分之三也都要流向淮河（其余流向洪泽湖）。因而，这些通向淮河的支流，虽经疏浚，在大雨之后仍然会受淮河顶托，河水汇集在沿淮低洼地区排泄不出，造成涝灾。今年汛期淮河干流和主要支流的堤防都没有溃决，可是淮北地区仍有数百万亩农田成灾，就是这个原因。
    目前降低淮河干流水位的措施在短期内还不能实现，治淮委员会和安徽省水利厅根据中共安徽省委的指示，和蚌埠、阜阳两专署共同研究后，拟定了与“农业三改”相结合的治涝规划方案。这个方案要求：从今冬明春开始，淮北地区争取在五年左右达到免除1956年型的内涝灾害，在一般雨量年份，除死洼地外，做到所有圈圩的地方都有条件获得丰收。
    今年淮北种植双季稻早稻又获得成功。这说明淮北地区的土壤、雨量是适宜种水稻的。问题在于如何逐步改变广大农民的耕作习惯，并教给他们筑圩、打畦田和种稻的技术。安徽省农业水利部门十分重视筑圩工作，目前正在加紧训练干部，调配人力，预计在10月底和11月初，各县的筑圩工程都能开工。有关的河道疏浚及修筑涵闸桥梁等工程也将由治淮委员会统一规划设计，在今年冬季开始施工。
