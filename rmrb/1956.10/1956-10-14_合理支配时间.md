Some young people, since embarking on the march towards science, have been working very hard on their spare-time studies. In addition to using relatively complete blocks of time to study diligently, they have also made full use of "fragmented" time, reading foreign languages ​​early in the morning, reading newspapers while waiting in line for meals, and so on; activities such as strolling down the street and idle chatting have been greatly reduced.

However, the way some young people cherish their spare time is worth considering. There are young people who "march" into the night until one or two o'clock, and then go to work the next day feeling drowsy and dozing off. They concentrate on reading during their spare time, but are perfunctory during work hours. There are also young people whose after-work study achievements have improved since marching towards science, but whose work errors have also increased.

Here, we can mention one thing. A member of an agricultural production cooperative raised a flock of chickens, and the chickens ran into the fields and spoiled the crops. However, this member said with peace of mind: "The crops the chickens eat belong to the cooperative, but the eggs they lay are mine."

Anyone who hears this member's words will laugh at him for being too selfish and for not paying enough attention to collective interests. However, how much difference is there between our young comrades who focus on studying and neglect work, cherish spare time and waste work time, compared to this member? Using the same words, can't we also say: "Work time belongs to the public, and spare time is my own?"

Obviously, this approach of pitting work against spare-time studies is wrong. Cherishing spare time is good, but it should not lead to wasting work time, because the purpose of marching towards science is, of course, to enrich oneself, but more fundamentally, to improve work and build our country. For young people who are employed, there is a primary and secondary relationship between work and spare-time studies. Since it is spare-time study, it is determined that the study is of a spare-time nature and should be based on doing a good job. No matter what the direction of study is, it should not hinder work. Otherwise, it would be putting the cart before the horse, which would not only bring losses to work, but also be of no benefit to oneself.

    合理支配时间
    于也名
    有一些青年，自向科学进军以来，对业余进修抓得很紧，除了用比较完整的时间认真读书以外，还充分利用了“零碎”时间，早起读外文，吃饭排队的时候看报，等等；逛马路、闲聊天之类的活动大大减少了。
    不过，有些青年珍惜业余时间的方法却是值得商量的。有这样的青年，他在夜间“进军”到一点、两点，到第二天上班，昏昏沉沉，打瞌睡，业余时间他聚精会神地读书，工作时间却敷衍了事。也有这样的青年，向科学进军以来，业余学习成绩提高了，工作差错却也增加了。
    这里，可以提及一件事情。一个农业生产合作社的社员养了一群鸡，鸡跑到田里糟蹋庄稼。可是，这位社员却心安理得地说：“鸡吃的庄稼是社里的，下的蛋是我自己的”。
    听了这个社员的话，谁都会笑他太自私，笑他太不重视集体利益。可是，我们那些抓紧学习放松工作，珍惜业余时间而浪费工作时间的青年同志，同这个社员相比，差别有多少呢？用同样的话套一下，不也可以说：“工作时间是公家的，业余时间是我自己的”吗？
    显然，这种把工作同业余进修对立起来的做法是不对的。珍惜业余时间是好的，但不应因此而浪费工作时间，因为向科学进军的目的，固然是为了充实自己，但更根本的还是为了提高工作，建设我们的国家。对在职青年来说，工作与业余进修有个主次关系，既然是业余进修，就决定了进修是业余性质的，应当以做好工作为前提，不管进修方向如何，都不应当妨碍工作。要不然，就是本末倒置，就不仅会给工作带来损失，对自己也没有好处。
