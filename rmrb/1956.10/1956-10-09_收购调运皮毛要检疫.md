    Quarantine Required for Purchasing and Transporting Furs
    Tianjin is one of the distribution centers for hides and skins in the country. In recent years, the number of hides and skins transferred to Tianjin from all over the country has been increasing. However, many producing areas do not carry out quarantine of hides and skins. As a result, the infectious disease of livestock – anthrax – has spread to Tianjin along with the hides, skins, and wool. In recent years, more than 60 people in Tianjin have been infected with this disease. It is hoped that various localities will purchase, store, and transport livestock products that have been slaughtered centrally after quarantine and those that have been slaughtered dispersedly without quarantine separately. For those that have not been quarantined, it is best to do a good job of quarantine before transportation. The transportation department should separate furs and other goods, load and unload them at designated locations, and pack them tightly to prevent infection during transportation. Chen Baoguang

    收购调运皮毛要检疫
    天津是全国皮张集散地之一，近几年来全国各地皮张调津数量不断增加。但是许多产地对皮张都不进行检疫，这样家畜传染病——炭疽病也就随着皮张、绒毛传到了天津，几年来天津感染这种病的有六十多人。希望各地在收购皮张时将经过检疫后集中屠宰的和未经检疫分散屠宰的畜产品，分别进行收购、储运。对未经检疫的最好能在调运前作好检疫工作，交通运输部门应将皮毛等物与其他货物分开，指定地点装卸，并要包装严密以防止在运输过程中造成传染。　陈保光
