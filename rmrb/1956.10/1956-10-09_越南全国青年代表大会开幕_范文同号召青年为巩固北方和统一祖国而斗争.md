    Pham Van Dong Calls on Youth to Struggle for the Consolidation of the North and the Unification of the Fatherland
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 8th. The long-prepared Vietnam National Youth Congress solemnly opened today at the Hanoi Grand Theater.

    This congress, jointly convened by the National Preparatory Committee of the Vietnam Youth United Front and the Central Committee of the Vietnam Youth Federation, will summarize the experiences of the Vietnam youth movement over the past ten years and discuss the establishment of a new youth united front organization. This new organization will be broader in its representation than the Vietnam Youth Federation, and it will unite the strength of all Vietnamese youth to strive for the unification of Vietnam and the consolidation of the North.

    Prime Minister Pham Van Dong delivered a congratulatory message to the congress on behalf of the Vietnam Labor Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He pointed out that the unity of Vietnamese youth marks the great unity of the Vietnamese people. He called on Vietnamese youth to struggle for the consolidation of the North and the unification of the fatherland, and to spare no effort to defend the democratic republican system of the North.

    Representatives from the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the Hanoi Youth Organization also offered congratulations to the congress.

    Hoang Minh Chinh, Secretary-General of the Vietnam Youth Federation, delivered a report to the congress on the Vietnam youth movement and the future tasks of Vietnamese youth. He said that in order to consolidate peace, unify the country, build our beloved motherland, and bring a happy and bright future to the younger generation, all young men and women are required to expand and strengthen unity more than ever before, and to establish a truly broad and powerful new national youth united organization in accordance with the needs of the new situation.

    The 720 youth representatives will hear a report on the new constitution tomorrow. The congress is scheduled to last for eight days.
