What Kind of Automobile Factory Have We Built
By Our Correspondent Chen Ji

　　Looks Like a School at First Glance

　　Entering the factory gate and going all the way to the front of the thermal power plant, there is a wide, light gray avenue. On both sides of the avenue, neat rows of saplings are growing. The trolley tracks and asphalt roads at the entrance, like gray ribbons, stretch out from the middle of a large area of employee dormitories, all the way to the beautiful city of Changchun. Four towering sentry posts stand quietly on the corners of the buildings in front and behind the factory. The four tall chimneys of the thermal power plant gently roll out clusters of white smoke, spreading like clouds into the blue sky behind the factory buildings. The four-story buildings on the front of the six main workshops stand with rows of milky-yellow columns, like bright silk streamers hanging in front of the doors. These buildings are where employees change clothes, eat, rest, and work, and they also serve to block the sound of machinery from the factory. Between the three workshops, two aerial red corridors span across, connecting the production lines of the workshops. The layout of the entire factory is solemn, harmonious, beautiful, and colorful, like a moving oil painting. At first glance, this does not look like a large factory, but like a quiet university.

　　This is the First Automobile Works that millions of eyes across the country are watching. In summer, entering the factory building is like entering a shady garden. Even standing next to a furnace with a temperature of over a thousand degrees, the gusts of cool air blown by specially designed equipment can dry the sweat on your body. In the cold winter, entering the factory building is like entering a warm greenhouse. Even standing by the factory door with frequent traffic, there is no invasion of cold wind; a device called "warm air curtain" blocks the cold air flowing into the factory. The dust removal equipment in the factory sucks away smoke and turbid air, ensuring the freshness of the air inside the factory. Our automobile factory is a place where people can work happily.

　　Everything is Brand New

　　The exterior of the factory building looks like a solemn university, but the interior of the factory building is boiling with the sound of labor like a tide. Those dozens of large air hammers, like angry giants, breathe heavily and make loud "dong, dong" noises, hammering the hard steel materials into various shapes like kneading dough. The countless rapidly rotating automatic and semi-automatic machine tools hiss and fly out blue iron filings, and puff out sparks, polishing all kinds of steel billets. Those towering steel presses, two or three stories high, stamp large pieces of steel plates into car heads and mudguards in a few strokes...

　　These machines and equipment are all brand new. In this large factory, nothing is not brand new. Tens of thousands of pieces of equipment, densely packed steel frames, hundreds of buildings, roads and railways running across the factory, all emit dazzling light. The sixty-meter-high chimney, the clock tower-like water tower, the silver-white cupola, the vast workshop like a stadium, which one is not new? Friends from dozens of countries, seeing such a brand new factory, all praised the great spirit of China's construction.

　　The Changchun Automobile Factory was built with the strong assistance of the Soviet Union. The Soviet government and people mobilized almost all the famous machinery manufacturing plants in the country to manufacture equipment for our automobile factory; many newly trial-produced equipment were shipped to our country. Therefore, Soviet comrades also recommended to foreign friends: "If you want to see the new equipment of the automobile factory, it is best to go to Changchun, China!"

　　High Production Efficiency

　　The equipment of the First Automobile Works all has high production efficiency. They all use ingenious special devices to reduce people's physical labor.

　　In the foundry to the left of the thermal power plant, it is the place where automobile castings are supplied to the entire factory. When it comes to the factory buildings for sand casting, people will naturally imagine such a scene: smoke is filled, sparks are flying, the whole room is hot, and the workers are sweating. However, here the air is fresh, the sun is plentiful, the temperature is appropriate, which is completely another situation. In the five- or six-story-high factory building filled with steel frames, at the touch of a button, more than a hundred belts run incessantly from the sky to the ground, transporting sand. The clay dried by the machine and the pulverized coal powder ground by the machine are automatically blown to the sand mixing place by compressed air pipelines. The automatic sand milling machine can add materials, add water, ventilate, cool, quantitatively discharge materials by itself, and magically mix sand, clay and coal powder to reach the standard. This work, which I don't know how much manpower it would take, is done all at once. The sand mold made by the sand casting machine in an instant walks along the conveyor belt to the front of the pouring platform. The pouring platform can move by itself. The pouring workers hold the molten iron ladle suspended in the air, stand on the pouring platform, and can calmly pour molten iron into each sand box that comes over without moving. Through such coordinated and stable labor, malleable cast iron and gray cast iron with high technical requirements can be manufactured. Here, there are no sand casting workers squatting beside the sand mold with a scraper, and no workers pushing small carts to transport sand back and forth. Here, heavy physical labor has been replaced by wonderful machines and conveyor belts.

　　Opposite the foundry is the forging workshop. The scorching hot furnace burns all kinds of steel materials red and glowing. A large air hammer with a hammer head weighing ten tons fiercely strikes the red-hot steel with the momentum of thunder. In just over a minute, a steel material weighing more than one hundred and thirty pounds is hammered into a forging with six cranks. The impact force of this air hammer falling down is almost ten thousand tons. There are no blacksmiths wielding iron hammers here, and die forging air hammers and power forging machines have thousands of times more strength than them. And they guarantee the complex and precise shape of the forgings.

　　The forgings and castings of automobiles are born in the hot and loud labor; the engine, gearbox, chassis and cab of automobiles are gradually formed in precise and careful labor. These main parts of the car are composed of thousands of parts of all sizes. From the surface, the car parts are very plain. There are no delicate patterns, but they all contain wonderful skills. Their size, length, thickness, thickness, squareness, roundness, are all the crystallization of careful labor. Some tolerances are as thin as one-fifth of a hair; some finishes are as bright as a mirror that reflects human shadows. This is by no means something that can be seen clearly with the naked eye, nor can it be accurately touched with the hand. They require high science and technology, and they require specialized and precise machine tools. Some machine tools have shafts on three or four sides and can feed tools at the same time. Their processing capacity is really "a small sorcerer seeing a great sorcerer" compared with ordinary machine tools. They are not only multi-axis, but also automatic or semi-automatic. With them, not only is time saved, but also physical and mental labor is reduced.

　　That special drilling machine with seventy-six axes feeds tools from three sides at the same time, and drills the holes of the hard cylinder block in a few minutes. This machine tool replaces the work of many machine tools. However, it is operated by a young girl.

　　The most fascinating is an automatic processing line. It combines five machine tools into a long combined machine tool. It can automatically push parts weighing three hundred pounds and drill holes in order. After the processing is completed, it pushes the parts out; if there is a failure, it can stop automatically. It processes nine large parts weighing three hundred pounds at a time, but the workers who operate it only need to press the button.

　　Many people know that the Moscow Automobile Factory has newly manufactured a unique forging press for the First Automobile Works. This new type of forging press specially designed for manufacturing automobile beams has a pressure of three thousand five hundred tons, is twelve meters high, and weighs seven hundred tons. In order to manufacture it, the Moscow Automobile Factory specially opened a new workshop; in order to transport it, it specially investigated the railways and bridges from Moscow to Changchun, and built a special railway open car.

　　The automobile factory also has various types of machine tools and furnaces. They all have strong production capacity and can guarantee the complex and special technical requirements of parts processing.

　　Like Hundreds of Small Streams Flowing to the Long River

　　Some people say that the production situation of the First Automobile Works is like thousands of small streams flowing to the long river. All facilities are adapted to large-scale continuous production. From outside the factory to inside the factory, from the air to the ground, from this machine tool to that machine tool, from this workshop to that workshop, are filled with all kinds of transportation equipment. Some are long belts that pass through underground tunnels and climb over high altitudes to transport coal and sand; some are mechanical conveyor belts hanging in the air with various parts; some are roller tables like iron long tables connecting machine tools and machine tools; some are long corridors spanning several workshops to transport large parts; some are overhead cranes running back and forth on three or four floors; in addition, there are cars and electric vehicles that transport back and forth on the ground.

　　These dozens of miles of mechanical conveyor belts and thousands of cranes, hoists and elevators are connected into production lines, and combined into a coordinated large-scale continuous production network.

　　More than two thousand different parts of all sizes are processed in continuous production along their respective production lines. They come down from the conveyor belt, are processed on the first machine tool, and then go to the second machine tool and the third machine tool through the conveyor belt. That cylinder block part has to flow through more than seventy different machine tools, go through one hundred and twelve processes, and almost walk a mile long production line to be processed.

　　Various processed parts leave their respective production lines and gather to the sub-assembly lines of each workshop. The assembly workers assemble them to make automobile parts such as chassis, gearboxes, engines, and cabs. These parts and some parts and cooperative products are then transported through transportation lines and gathered to the general assembly workshop.

　　Standing on the floor of the general assembly workshop, you can see many conveyor belts connected from other workshops. They carry the processed parts and parts from each workshop to the general assembly line in an orderly manner. The general assembly line is like a long river, floating with objects of all sizes, slowly moving forward. Moving a few steps, the workers assemble a certain part of the car; moving to the end, they assemble a car that can be driven.

　　The automobile factory also relies on countless railways and highways to connect with hundreds of factories and mines across the country, forming a collaborative network. More than four hundred kinds of cooperative products and hundreds of specifications of metal materials from all over the country are transported here to ensure the continuous production of automobiles. The production of automobiles is a highly collaborative large-scale production that affects the whole country.

　　The First Automobile Works also has more than ten kinds of amateur learning organizations. It not only continuously produces automobiles, but also continuously trains talents for the national automobile industry.

　　That's the kind of automobile factory we have built!

    我们建成了什么样的汽车厂
    本报记者　陈迹
    一眼看来好像学校
    走进工厂大门，一直到热电站的前面，是一条淡灰色的宽阔的大道。大道两旁，一排整齐的小树正在成长。门口的电车轨道和柏油马路，就像一条条灰色的带子，从一大片职工宿舍中间伸展出去，一直伸往美丽的长春市区。四座遥遥相对的了望亭，静静地站在厂房前后的楼角上。热电站的四根高大的烟囱，轻轻地滚出团团白烟，像云朵似地铺往厂房背后的蔚蓝天空。六大工场正面的四层高楼，竖立着一排排乳黄色的廊柱，像是鲜艳的绸幛垂挂在门前。这些高楼，是职工们更衣、吃饭、休息和办公的地方，它们同时起了阻挡厂房内机器声响传出来的作用。在三座工场之间，横跨着两条腾空的红色走廊，它们是连接车间和车间流水生产的运输线路。全厂的布局，庄严和谐，美丽多彩，好似一幅动人的油画。一眼看来，这里不像一座大工厂，而像一座幽静的高等学校。
    这就是全国千万双眼睛望着的第一汽车制造厂。夏天，走进厂房，好像走进荫凉的花园。那怕是站在一千多度高温的炉旁，特置的设备吹来的阵阵清风，也可以吹干你身上的汗珠。到了冰冷的冬天，走进厂房，又会像是走进了和暖的温室。即使站在车辆往来频繁的厂房门边，也没有寒风的侵袭；一种名叫“暖风幕”的设备，拦住了流往厂房内的冷空气。厂内的除尘设备，吸走了烟雾和浊气，保证了厂内空气的新鲜。我们的汽车厂，是一个使人能愉快劳动的地方。
    一切都是崭新的
    厂房的外貌像个肃静的大学校，厂房的内部却沸腾着潮水般的劳动声响。那几十个像发怒的巨人似的大气锤，气喘喘地发出咚咚的巨响，像捶面似地把坚硬的钢料捶成各种形状。那数不清的飞快旋转的自动的、半自动的机床，嘶嘶地飞出蓝色的铁屑，呼呼地冒出星星的火花，把各种各样的钢胚削光磨亮。那一座座全钢的两三层楼房高的大压床，几下子就把大块钢板冲压成汽车头和挡泥板……。
    这些机器，这些设备，全都是崭新的。在这个大工厂里，没有一样东西不是全新的。成千上万台设备，密密麻麻的钢架，成百幢楼房，纵横厂内外的马路和铁路，到处都发出耀眼的光芒。六十公尺高的烟囱，钟楼似的大水塔，银白色的冲天炉，辽阔的体育场一般的大工场，哪一样不是新的？来自几十个国家的友人，他们看见这样全新的工厂，都对中国建设的伟大气魄表示赞扬。
    长春汽车厂是在苏联大力帮助下建成的。苏联政府和人民，动员了几乎全国所有著名的机械制造厂，专门为我国制造汽车厂的设备；不少设备新试制成功，就运到我国来了。因此，苏联同志也向国外的朋友推荐说：“想看汽车厂的新设备，最好到中国长春去！”
    高度的生产效能
    第一汽车厂的设备，都具有高度的生产效能。它们都用精巧的特殊装置，减轻了人们的体力劳动。
    在热电站左边的铸工场，它是供应全厂汽车铸件的地方。一提起翻砂铸铁的厂房，人们自然会想像出这样一幅景象：烟雾弥漫，火花四射，满屋热烘烘的，工人汗流夹背。但是，这里却是空气清新，阳光充足，温度适当，完全是另外一种情况。在五六层楼高的排满钢架的厂房里，一按电钮，从天上到地下，一百多条皮带川流不息，运送砂子。机器烘干的粘土，机器磨碎的煤粉，都被压缩空气管道自动地吹往配砂的地方。自动碾砂机自己能够加料，加水，通风，冷却，定量，出料，奇妙地把砂、粘土和煤粉混合起来达到合乎标准的程度。这种不知道要花多少人工的工作，它一下子就做完了。翻砂机刹那间做成的砂型，随着输送带走到浇注平台前面。浇注平台能够自己移动。浇注工人掌住悬在半空轨道上的铁水包，站在浇注平台上，不需要走动，就能从容不迫地把每个走过来的砂箱注满铁水。经过这样协调平稳的劳动，就可以制造出技术要求很高的可锻铸铁和灰口铸铁。在这里，找不到蹲在砂型旁边手拿刮刀的翻砂工，也看不见推着小车来往运砂的工人。在这里，笨重的体力劳动，已经由奇妙的机器和运输带所代替了。
    在铸工场的对面，是锻工场。灼热的高温炉，把各种各样的钢材烧得通红发光。一座锤头有十吨重的大气锤，以雷霆万钧的气势，狠狠地捶打火红的钢材。一分多钟时间，就把一百三十多斤重的钢材，捶成了六个曲柄的锻件。这种大气锤落下来的冲击力量，几乎就有一万吨重。这里没有抡铁锤的铁匠，模锻气锤和平锻机有比他们大几千倍的力气。并且保证了锻件的复杂而精密的形状。
    汽车的锻件和铸件，是在火热的声响巨大的劳动中诞生的；汽车的发动机，变速箱，底盘和驾驶室等，都是在精密的细心的劳动中逐渐形成的。这些汽车的主要部件，是由大大小小的成千的零件组合成的。从表面看来，汽车零件很平淡。没有什么细致的花纹，但是它们都包含着绝妙的技巧。它们的大小，长短，粗细，厚薄，方圆，没有不是细心劳动的结晶。有的公差，要像五分之一根发丝那样纤细；有的光洁度，要像照出人影的镜子那样光亮。这决不是用肉眼看看能够看清楚的，也不是用手摸摸能够摸准确的。它们需要高度的科学技术，需要专门的精密的机床。有些机床，三面或四面都有轴，都能同时进刀，它们的加工能力，同普通机床比起来，真是“大巫见小巫”。它们不只是多轴的，而且是自动的或半自动的。有了它们，不仅节省了时间，还减轻了体力和脑力的劳动。
    那座有着七十六个轴的专门钻床，从三面一齐进刀，几分钟，就把坚硬的汽缸体的孔眼钻好了。这台机床，代替了许多台机床的工作。操纵它的却是一位年轻的姑娘。
    最引人入胜的，是一条自动加工线。它把五台机床组成一座长形的联合机床。它能自动地推着三百斤重的零件，顺序钻孔。加工好了，它就把零件推出来；如果出了故障，它能自动停下来。它一次同时加工九个三百斤重的大零件，但是操纵它的工人只是按按电钮就可以了。
    许多人知道，莫斯科汽车工厂为第一汽车制造厂新制成了一部独特的压锻机。这座专门制造汽车大梁的新型压锻机，具有三千五百吨压力，十二公尺高，七百吨重。为了制造它，莫斯科汽车工厂特地新开辟一个车间；为了运送它，特地调查了从莫斯科到长春的铁路和桥梁，新造了一节专门的铁路敞车。
    汽车厂还有各式各样的机床和炉子。它们都有强大的生产能力，都能保证零件加工的复杂特殊的技术要求。
  像百条小川流往长河
    有人说，第一汽车厂的生产情况，就像千百条小川流往长河一样。一切设施，都是适应大流水生产的。从厂外到厂内，从空中到地下，从这台机床到那台机床，从这个车间到那个车间，都排满了形形色色的运输设备。有的是通过地道爬过高空的运送煤和砂的长长的皮带；有的是悬在半空的钩挂了各种零件的机械输送带；有的是联系机床和机床的像铁的长桌的滚道；有的是跨越几个车间的输送大部件的长廊；有的是穿梭般运行在三四层楼上的天车；另外，还有在平地上来往运输的汽车和电动车。
    这些几十里长的机械输送带和成千台吊车、起重机和升降机，联系成一条条生产线，组合成一个协调的大流水生产的网带。
    大大小小的两千多种不同的零件，都沿着各自的生产线，流水加工。它们从输送带上下来，在第一台机床上加工好了，又经过输送带，到第二台机床、第三台机床去。那个汽缸体零件，要流过七十多台不同的机床，要经过一百一十二道工序，几乎要走过一里长的生产线，才能加工出来。
    各种加工好的零件，离开各自的生产线，又纷纷汇往各车间的分装配线去。装配工人把它们配装起来，就装出了底盘、变速箱、发动机和驾驶室等汽车部件。这些部件和一些零件、协作产品，又都通过运输线路，汇集到总装配车间。
    站在总装配车间的楼上，可以看见许多条从其他车间接连过来的输送带。它们载着各车间加工好的部件和零件，有条不紊地送到总装配线上。总装配线像条长河，浮着大大小小的物件，缓缓地向前移动。移动几步，工人们就装出了汽车的某一部分；移动到末尾，就装出了能够开动的汽车。
    汽车厂还依靠无数条铁路和公路，同全国成百个工厂和矿山联系起来，连成一个协作的网。来自各地的四百多种协作产品和几百种规格的金属材料，被运送到这里，保证不断地生产出汽车来。汽车的生产，是牵动全国的高度协作性的大生产。
    第一汽车厂还有十多种业余学习的组织。这里不但不断地生产出汽车，还不断地为国家培养出汽车工业的人材。
  　我们建成的就是这样的汽车厂！
