    Xinhua News Agency report: Most primary and secondary schools in the disaster-stricken areas of Hebei Province have resumed classes.

    Various localities have made great efforts to ensure that schools can open. Before the start of the term, teachers from various schools visited student families to encourage students to return to school. In some counties, credit cooperatives provided loans to help students enroll. Some schools allocated part of their welfare funds to subsidize teachers with financial difficulties. Agricultural cooperatives in various places assisted teachers and students in repairing damaged school buildings. In Xinhe County, members of the agricultural cooperative voluntarily donated materials to help schools build houses. Currently, in the four special districts of Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Handan, and Xingtai, 98% of middle school students and over 90% of primary school students have resumed classes.
