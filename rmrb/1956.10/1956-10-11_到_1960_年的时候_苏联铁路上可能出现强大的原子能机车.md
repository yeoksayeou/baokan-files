    By 1960…
    Powerful Nuclear-Powered Locomotives May Appear on Soviet Railways
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th - The Soviet Union has drafted several designs for nuclear locomotives, and by the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), powerful nuclear-powered locomotives may appear on major Soviet trunk lines.
    An interesting nuclear locomotive design was recently devised by young experts Stepanov and Sharzhikov. This locomotive consists of two parts. The nuclear reactor is installed in the first part. It is a relatively small cylinder, two meters high and one and a half meters in diameter. Zirconium tubes are inserted into the graphite blocks within the cylinder. Inside the zirconium tubes are natural uranium rods containing uranium-235. The reactor does not contain much uranium, but one uranium rod is sufficient to ensure the locomotive operates continuously for three hundred days. The steam generated in the boiler is at eighty atmospheres and a temperature of four hundred degrees. The steam drives the steam turbine installed in the second part, and the electricity it generates powers the traction motors under the locomotive, enabling the locomotive to pull the train forward.

    到1960年的时候……
    苏联铁路上可能出现强大的原子能机车
    新华社莫斯科10日电　苏联已制定了几种原子机车的设计图样，在第六个五年计划（1956—1960年）的末尾，苏联的重要干线上可能就会出现马力强大的原子能机车。
    一个有趣的原子机车图样是青年专家斯杰潘诺夫和夏日科夫不久以前设计的。这种机车由两部分组成。原子反应堆安装在第一部分。这是一个高两公尺、直径一点五公尺的不太大的汽缸。在汽缸的石墨块内插入锆管。锆管里面是含铀二三五的天然铀棒。反应堆中放的铀不多，但是一根铀棒足以保证机车不间断地运转三百天。锅炉里面所产生的蒸汽是八十个大气压，温度是四百度。蒸气推动装设在第二部分的汽轮机，它所发出的电流又推动机车下面的牵引电动机，于是机车就能牵引列车前进。
