The autumn harvest is in sight everywhere you look in the Tangshan area of Hebei Province. Now, the farmers are carrying out the autumn harvest with joy. This year, the grain output of the whole region is expected to increase by about 35% compared with the original plan. According to the autumn harvest distribution plans made by 161 agricultural production cooperatives in the region, 158 cooperatives will be able to increase the income of more than 90% of their members.

    These three girls, Wang Huilan, Wang Shulan, and Wang Rulan (from left to right), are production experts in the Bohai Agricultural Production Cooperative and models of "loving the cooperative as their home and uniting the masses" promoted throughout the province. People call them the "Three Lans." This year, the entire cooperative has achieved a bumper harvest, and many friends have written letters to congratulate them on their victory and express their desire to learn from them.
    Earlier this year, 55 elementary cooperatives in Funing County merged to form the Bohai Agricultural Production Cooperative. This advanced cooperative owns more than 43,000 mu of land. In addition to planting corn, sorghum, peanuts, and cotton, it also planted more than 4,700 mu of paddy rice and dryland rice. Most of these rice paddies are newly reclaimed wasteland, low-lying land, and some sandy land this year. This year, the cooperative's rice yields an average of more than 600 jin per mu, an increase of more than 120 jin compared to last year. The above picture shows the shock troops of the youth production team harvesting rice in a tense atmosphere. The upper left corner is the new canal built by the cooperative this year.
    In order to help the organized farmers gradually learn to use agricultural machinery, Funing County established an agricultural technology extension station in the Bohai Agricultural Production Cooperative. This is a technical member of the agricultural technology extension station explaining to the youth in the cooperative how to use a twelve-row animal-drawn planter.
    The threshing machine is constantly turning.
    Before the Shuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative became an advanced cooperative, the highest peanut yield per mu was more than 300 jin; after the transition, due to sufficient fertilizer and improved planting methods, the highest peanut yield per mu reached more than 600 jin.
    In previous years, the highest sweet potato yield per mu in the Shuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative was only more than 2,000 jin, but this year it reached 8,000 jin. This has brought a prosperous atmosphere to the sideline production of grinding sweet potato starch. Now the whole cooperative has 127 grinders, which can produce 5,000 jin of starch a day, supplying the needs of cities and industry.
    The Sunjialou Agricultural Production Cooperative has 949 households and owns 8,544 mu of land. It is one of the cooperatives with a high corn yield this year. This year, the 3,584 mu of corn planted yielded an average of 768 jin per mu. When people walk into the Sunjialou Cooperative, which has been transformed into an advanced cooperative, they can see such scenes of bumper harvests everywhere.
    "Look! If it weren't for sufficient fertilizer and artificial pollination, such corn wouldn't have grown," Cui Shuying (left) said to Tian Xiurong (right) triumphantly.

    高级社的第一个秋收
    到了河北省唐山专区，处处可以看到大秋作物丰收的景象。现在，农民们怀着喜悦的心情进行秋收。今年全区的粮食产量要比原订计划增加35％左右。从这个专区的一百六十一个农业生产社作出的秋收分配方案来看，就有一百五十八个社能够实现90％以上的社员增加收入。

    这三个姑娘叫王惠兰、王淑兰、王汝兰（从左至右），她们是渤海农业生产合作社里的生产能手，也是全省所推广的“爱社如家，团结群众”的模范，人们都称她们为“三兰”。今年全社获得了丰收，许多朋友写信来庆贺她们的胜利，并表示要向她们学习。
    今年初在抚宁县有五十五个初级社合并成了渤海农业生产合作社。这个高级社拥有土地四万三千多亩，除了种植玉米、高粱、花生、棉花以外，还种了四千七百多亩水稻和旱稻。这些稻田大多数是今年新开垦的荒地、洼地和一些沙滩地。今年社里的稻子，平均每亩可产六百多斤，比去年增产一百二十多斤。上图是青年生产队的突击手们在紧张地收割水稻。左上角是这个社在今年新开的水渠。
    为了帮助组织起来的农民逐步学会使用农业机器，抚宁县在渤海农业生产合作社里设立了农业技术推广站。这是农业技术推广站的技术人员在向社里的青年们讲解怎样使用十二行畜力播种机。
    打谷机不停地在转。
    曙光农业生产合作社在没有转成高级社以前，每亩花生最高产量是三百多斤；转社以后，由于肥料充足，改进种植方法，每亩花生最高的产量达到了六百多斤。
    曙光农业生产合作社往年的白薯每亩的最高产量才两千多斤，今年达到了八千斤。这给磨制白薯淀粉的副业生产带来了兴隆气象。现全社有粉磨一百二十七台，一天能制出淀粉五千斤，供给城市和工业上的需要。
    孙家楼农业生产合作社有九百四十九户，拥有土地八千五百四十四亩，是今年玉米产量较高的一个社。今年种植的三千五百八十四亩玉米，平均每亩产量七百六十八斤。当人们走到了已经转为高级社的孙家楼社里，到处都可以看见这种丰收的场面。
    “你看！要不是肥料充足和人工授粉，哪会长出这样的玉米来。”崔淑英（左）向田秀荣（右）得意地说。
