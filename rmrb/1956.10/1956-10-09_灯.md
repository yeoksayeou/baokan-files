　　In the autumn of 1936, several of us students who were expelled from the provincial school in Suzhou due to "ideological problems" coincidentally entered the Jingzhi Girls' School in Wuxi. Initially, we didn't know each other, or rather, we didn't dare to know each other. We were in different classrooms and only often met in the library and reading room. With our heads lowered, we would steal glances at each other over newspapers and books, trying to see what the other was paying attention to. How sensitive those young hearts were! Even the unconscious gestures during reading were recognized by the other as a joyful discovery. That's how we got to know each other in silence.
　　The newspaper on October 20th was no different from usual, and Mr. Lu Xun's death was not published in a prominent place, but even if it was in small print, we would have noticed it immediately. We cried without concealment. The mournful sound made even me aware of the sorrowful atmosphere it created. ... There were even some indifferent people who looked at us askance. How proud we were at that time, because we knew who we were crying for; we were oblivious to everything around us and didn't care about anything. Crying, crying, suddenly we decided in unison: all those with tears in their eyes should hold hands, and we became friends.
　　We were all poor, but every Sunday we used the warm coins and small silver pieces gathered from each other to buy books; to provide lunch money for the classmates who represented everyone at meetings. We started to study and work in an organized way, obviously after Mr. Lu Xun's death. When the War of Resistance began, we all joined the revolutionary ranks. No matter where we were scattered, as long as we occasionally met, we would recall Mr. Lu Xun's death and the days when we first met, as if the kind Mr. Lu Xun was sitting among us, introducing our friendship; we will never forget that when we were groping in the dark, it was he who held up the lantern for us. ...

    1936年秋天，我们几个因“思想问题”被苏州的省立学校开除的学生，都不约而同地进了无锡的竞志女校。最初我们几个人是并不相识的，或者说还不敢相识。我们分在不同的教室里，只在图书馆和阅览室中常常遇见。低着头，彼此用越过报纸和书面的偷偷的一瞥，去探视对方注意阅读的是什么，那幼小的心是多么敏感呵，在阅读中连自己也不经意的举止，都被对方认作喜悦的发现，我们就这样相识在默默之中。
    10月20日的报纸并不比往日的异样些，而且鲁迅先生的死讯也不刊载在注目的地方，可是即使用的是八号字，我们也会立刻注意到的。我们毫无掩饰地哭了，那哀哀的声音，连我自己也发觉它所造成的悲恸的气氛。……居然还有一些冷漠的人向我们侧目而视，那时我们有多么高傲，因为我们知道我们哭的是谁；我们旁若无人，什么也不去管它。哭着，哭着，突然我们又不约而同地决定：流着眼泪的人都拉起手来，我们成了朋友。
    我们都很穷，但是每在星期天，我们用各人身边凑来还带着体温的铜板、小银角子去买书；给代表大家去开会的同学作中午的餐费。我们有组织地学习和工作，显然是在鲁迅先生死后才开始的。抗战开始，我们都参加了革命的队伍，不问我们分在天南地北，只要我们偶而相遇，我们就会一同回忆鲁迅先生的死，回忆我们最初相识的日子，而仿佛慈祥的先生正坐在我们中间，作我们友谊的介绍人；我们不会忘记当我们在黑暗中摸索的时候，也正是他给我们高高地举着灯笼。………
