Xinhua News Agency, October 16th, Dispatch from TASS, Paris, October 15th: Many cities in Morocco held strikes on October 14th to protest the movement of French troops within the country. In Marrakech, construction workers on major construction sites went on strike for an entire day. In Casablanca, urban transportation was halted for an hour, and merchants in Tangier also closed their shops for an hour.

Reports indicate that the Moroccan government is striving to demand the cancellation of certain privileges that France still maintains, which are detrimental to Moroccan independence.

Crown Prince Moulay Hassan, the Chief of Staff of the Moroccan Army, has already traveled to Paris to negotiate this issue with the French government.

    摩洛哥人民罢工罢市
    据新华社16日讯　据塔斯社巴黎15日讯：摩洛哥有许多城市10月14日举行罢工，抗议法国部队在这个国家内调动。在卡拉喀什，各大建筑工地的建筑工人罢工了整整一天。在卡萨布兰卡，市区运输停止了一小时，丹吉尔商人也罢市一小时。
    有消息说，摩洛哥政府正在竭力要求取消法国仍然保持着的不利于摩洛哥独立的某些特权。
    摩洛哥陆军参谋长穆来·哈桑皇太子已经到巴黎同法国政府谈判这个问题。
