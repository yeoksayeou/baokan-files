Calling for Nurses

Patients are the service objects of nurses, and they generally respect the noble labor of nurses, but there are also many patients who show contempt for the labor of nurses. This phenomenon exists in the First Hospital of Nanchang City. Some patients mistakenly believe that nurses making beds and delivering bedpans are enjoyments they have bought with money. When their friends come to visit, they order nurses to be their receptionists and deliver boiled water. If the nurses don't do it, they will scold them: "Who are you serving?" "What are you doing!"

When the ward is busy and there are not enough workers, nurses often help with sweeping the floor, wiping tables, serving meals, washing dishes, and carrying patients. When the clerks are not enough, nurses have to register and keep accounts. When doctors are too busy, nurses have to fill out lab forms and perform intravenous injections and blood transfusions. Some doctors are unwilling to get up at night, and nurses even prescribe and dispense medicine themselves. They help doctors above and workers below, putting their own nursing work (such as observing changes in patients' conditions, understanding patients' psychological states, and other technical operations) aside. What makes them even more distressed is that sometimes patients call nurses and say: "I don't feel well, and you little nurses can't solve anything. Find a doctor for me, quickly!" When the nurse follows the patient's instructions to find a doctor, the doctor glares and says: "What kind of medical personnel are you? You have to come to the doctor even for a little medicine!" The nurse is caught in the middle, and in the end, she has to let the patient put a big label on her: "You are really irresponsible, you won't even find a doctor when I ask you to."

The situation of the head nurse is even worse. When there are not enough nurses, she has to work as a nurse. The doctor wants the head nurse to explain to the patients who have complaints. The administration office asks the head nurse where the doors and windows are broken. The accounting office asks the head nurse to urge the payment of medical expenses. The medical affairs office asks the head nurse for monthly reports. The president's office asks the head nurse for work summaries. The storage room asks the head nurse to prepare budgets, collect things, and check assets. The head nurse is so busy that she cannot carry out supervision, inspection, and technical guidance. This will greatly hinder the improvement of nursing science and affect the quality of medical services, which is a serious problem for both nurses and patients.

A fair appeal should be made for these nurses: respect the noble labor of nurses and quickly improve this extremely unreasonable situation of nursing work!

Caring for the Lives of Nurses

After several of us girls came to Huaihe Hospital, we were assigned to do nursing work. Our work is divided into early shifts, late shifts, two-section shifts, and graveyard shifts. In addition to work, sometimes there are three or four meetings a day, and the meetings are held after work. Those who work the night shift have to study after getting off work in the morning, and if there are meetings in the afternoon, they have to attend. As a result, they cannot sleep well during the day, and they still work as usual at night. Therefore, some nurses often have headaches and dizziness and their eyes turn black, and they even faint when they work at night. Because the hospital has few nursing staff, nurses often have to work overtime. Sometimes they even work more than ten hours, and it is common to work while sick.

For example, there is a nurse in our hospital who has long felt unwell, but because there are few people, she can't rest and is busy running up and down the stairs. One day, while hanging curtains for a patient, she fell off the bedside table when she felt dizzy and fainted on the spot.

In our hospital, the nurses who work the night shift don't even have a night shift room. We have repeatedly raised our opinions to the leaders, and only then did we find a small room. What is in the room? There are two or three broken beds and two moldy quilts. It is also very noisy outside, and we can't sleep after getting off work at night. Later, even such a room was gone, because guests came to the hospital and lived inside.

With the current situation of our nurses, how can we do our work well and how can we improve our skills?　　Wang Fei　Wu Ying　Wang Ping

Demands of Nursing Workers

Nursing is a specialized academic discipline that requires a broad base of scientific knowledge. However, what is the reality? Nursing education is currently limited to secondary vocational school education. After graduation, students can only be limited to the level of intermediate technical personnel for a long time, and they do not have the opportunity for further study. As a nurse, in addition to possessing general medical basic knowledge, one also needs to master nursing professional knowledge. It is inappropriate to limit such a discipline to secondary vocational school education.

At present, due to the lack of attention to nursing work by the health department, many nurses are not clear about the development prospects of their work. For example, nurses and medical assistants are both intermediate medical personnel, but their treatment is different. Some hospital leaders even do not regard nurses as technical personnel. The health education system has not established nursing training institutions. Even some senior nurses with advanced achievements do not receive the treatment of senior intellectuals.

In order for nurses to play their due role in their professional positions, we request that the health education department establish nursing professional training institutions, and we hope that the situation where universities and colleges do not have nursing departments will be changed.

At present, there are hundreds of thousands of nurses in the country, which is a huge and indispensable force on the medical and health front, and also a considerable number of intellectuals. Their problems should be solved.

### 尊重护士劳动，做好护理工作

    尊重护士劳动，做好护理工作
    为护士呼吁
    病人是护士的服务对象，他们一般是尊重护士的高尚劳动的，但是也有不少病人对护士的劳动表示轻蔑。在南昌市第一医院中就有这种现象。有些病人错误地认为，护士铺床、送大小便器是他们用钱买来的享受；当他们的朋友来探望时，则喝令护士给他们做招待员，送开水，假如护士不做，则要臭骂一顿：“你为谁服务”、“你干什么！”
    病房工作忙的时候，工人不够用，护士要经常帮着做扫地、抹桌、盛饭、洗碗、抬送病人的工作；事务员不够就要护士去挂号，记账；医师忙不过来时，又要护士填写化验单，作静脉注射及输血等，甚至医师在晚上不愿起来，护士还要自行处方发药。她们就是这样上帮医师、下帮工人，而把本身的护理工作（如观察病人病情变化、了解病人的心理状况及其他技术操作等）置于一旁。更使她们苦恼的是，有时病人把护士叫来说：“我身体不舒服，你这个小护士又不能解决什么问题，你给我找医师来，快去！”护士遵照病人的吩咐去找医师，医师却又把眼一瞪说：“你算是什么医务人员，连给一点药还要来找医师，真是！”护士就这样两头受气，最后还得硬着脖子让病人扣上一顶大帽子：“你真不负责任，叫你找医师也不去”。
    护士长的情况更糟。护士不够用，她要当一个护士去工作；医师要护士长向提意见的病人解释；事务室问护士长哪里的门窗破了；会计室找护士长催交医药费；医务室找护士长要月报表；院长室找护士长要工作总结；保管室要护士长编造预算、领报东西、清查财产。护士长忙得根本无法进行督促检查和技术指导的工作。这样就要大大地妨碍护理科学水平的提高，也影响医疗服务的质量，这对护士和病人来说，都是一个严重的问题。
    应该为这些护士们提出公正的呼吁：尊重护士的高尚劳动，赶快改善护士工作的这种极不合理的状况！

    关心护士的生活
    我们几个姑娘来到淮河医院以后，被分配做护理工作。我们的工作分早班、晚班、两节班和大夜班。除了工作以外，有时候一天就开三、四个会，并且会都是在下班的时间来开，上夜班的，早晨下班以后还要学习，如果下午有会议时还得参加，这样一来白天不能很好地睡觉，夜间还是照常工作。因此有的护士夜间上班的时候常常头疼发晕，两眼发黑，甚至晕倒。因为医院护理人员少，护士常常要加班加点。有时甚至工作十小时以上，带病工作也是常有的事。
    例如我们医院里有一位护士，虽然早就发觉自己身体不好，但因人少，也不得休息，忙的楼上楼下来回跑。她有一天在给病人挂窗帘时，头一晕就从床头柜上跌了下来，当时就昏过去了。
    在我们医院里，上夜班的护士连一间夜班室也没有，向领导上提了多次的意见，才找了一间小房子，房内有什么呢，有两三张破床和两条发霉的被子，外面又吵得很，晚上下班以后无法睡觉。后来，就连这样一间房子也没有了，因为医院里来了客人，又住在里边了。
    像我们护士目前这样的情况，怎么能把工作做好，怎么能在业务上提高呢？　王飞　武英　王萍
    护理工作者的要求
    护理是一种专门学术，需要广泛的科学知识作基础。可是，事实是怎样的呢？护理教育目前仅限于中等专业学校教育范围内。学生毕业以后，只能长期限于中级技术人员水平，得不到进修机会。作为一个护士，除了需要具备一般医学的基础知识以外，还需要掌握护士的专业知识。这样一门学科，要把它限制在中等专业学校教育范围内，我们同样感到是不太妥当的事。
    目前，由于卫生部门对护士工作不重视，很多护士不清楚工作的发展前途。如护士与医士同为中级医务人员，但待遇却不同。某些医院领导方面甚至不把护士当做技术人员看待。卫生教育系统也没有设立护士进修机构。就是一部分已有高深造诣的高级护士也得不到高级知识分子的待遇。
    为了让护士在自己的专业岗位上发挥应有的作用，我们要求卫生教育部门设立护理专业进修机构，并希望大学和高等学校没有护士院系的这一情况得到改变。
    目前，全国有护士十几万人，在医学卫生战线上是一支巨大的不可缺少的力量，同时也是一个为数不少的知识分子的队伍，她们的问题是应该获得解决的。
