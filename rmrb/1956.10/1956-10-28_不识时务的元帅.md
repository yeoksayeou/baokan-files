    A Marshal Who Doesn't Know the Times
    Whenever "Cold War" setbacks occur and bouts of hysterical clamoring erupt, the renowned Marshal Montgomery is invariably among those echoing the sentiments.

    On October 10th, British Marshal and Deputy Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Montgomery, once again unleashed his warmongering frenzy at the Royal Military Academy in Britain. This time, his bloodshot eyes gazed upon the "war prospects of the nuclear age," as he desperately clamored for the formulation of a "global master plan for the anti-communist struggle" for an anti-communist "crusade." However, he could not help but reveal that the current situation was not ideal. He criticized Western countries for being "insufficiently prepared for nuclear war," and he hoped to revive the "Cold War" atmosphere.

    It is remembered that when this marshal advocated nuclear war in May, he had more frankly expressed his "unease" about the desire of "any European country, including Britain," to abolish conscription and reduce armaments.

    What role is the marshal playing? When he says that "the use of nuclear weapons" is the "basis of all planning work" for the Supreme Headquarters of the North Atlantic Alliance, it is clear that the marshal is speaking as the Deputy Supreme Commander of this alliance and showing that he is loyal to this position. But one must ask, in whose interests is the marshal ultimately serving?

    Montgomery is a British marshal, and his loyalty to Britain is certainly beyond doubt. However, at least these points are facts: First, like the Pentagon generals and the American generals who serve as Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Alliance, he is very dissatisfied with the view of British leaders that war is unwinnable in the hydrogen bomb era and that peaceful coexistence is necessary. Second, Marshal Montgomery completely disregards the "warnings" of some British military leaders; for example, Viscount Hailsham, the First Lord of the Admiralty, recently said that Britain's strength could be destroyed overnight by atomic bombs. Third, the marshal certainly does not bother to listen to the British people's recent particularly intense calls to ban atomic and hydrogen weapons and to significantly reduce military spending to improve the financial and economic situation.

    The reaction of the British newspapers also proves how unpopular the marshal's atomic war clamor is in his own country. The "Daily Mirror" advised the British marshal to "give the country some peace"!

    Marshal Montgomery is bound to be notorious because he is by no means the originator of the anti-communist "crusade." In history, Hitler was the organizer of this "crusade," and at that time Montgomery was merely someone trembling with fear at Hitler's "Wehrmacht." Now the new organizers of the "crusade" are the figures in the Pentagon, and Montgomery is merely a pawn waving the flag under the command of American generals.

    However, in any case, Marshal Montgomery has seen the end of Hitler in the past, and now he will certainly not know less than the masters of the Pentagon: atomic war is not a game. There is an old Chinese saying: "A wise man submits to circumstances." Marshal Montgomery, you should calm down! (Xuan)

### 不识时务的元帅

    不识时务的元帅
    每当“冷战”受挫，歇斯底里叫嚣一阵一阵出现的时候，常常少不了大名鼎鼎的蒙哥马利元帅的应和。
    10月10日，英国元帅、北大西洋联盟军副司令蒙哥马利的好战狂，又在英国皇家军事学院发作了一顿。这一回他的涨血的眼睛张望着“核子世纪的战争远景”，力竭声嘶地大叫要为反共的“十字军远征”拟定一个“反共斗争的全球总计划”。但他不能不透露出，目前的景况并不美妙。他责备西方国家“对核子战争准备得不够充分”，他希望复活“冷战”气氛。
    记得这位元帅在5月间鼓吹核子战争时，曾更加坦率地表示他对“包括英国在内的任何欧洲国家”想取消强迫兵役和裁减军备的愿望是“抱着不安的心情”的。
    元帅是在充当一种什么角色呢？当他说：“使用核子武器”是北大西洋联军最高司令部的“全部计划工作的基础”的时候，很显然，元帅是作为这个联军的副统帅的身份说话的，并表明他是忠于这个职务的。但是，人们还是要问，元帅究竟是在为谁的利益服务呢？
    蒙哥马利是英国的元帅，他对英国的忠诚当然是不能怀疑的。但是，至少这几点是事实：第一、他同五角大楼的将军和担任北大西洋联军统帅的美国将军一样，对英国领导人认为在氢弹时代战争打不得，应该和平共处的说法，是很不满的。第二、蒙哥马利元帅对于英国某些军事领袖的“警告”是根本不放在眼中的，例如英国海军大臣黑尔什姆子爵最近就说过，英国的力量可以在一夜之间被原子弹所摧毁。第三、元帅当然更不屑听一下英国人民最近特别激烈地要求禁止原子武器和氢武器，大量削弱军费开支以改善财政经济状况的呼声。
    英国报纸的反应也证明，元帅的原子战争叫嚣在他国内是怎样不得人心。“每日镜报”劝告这位英国的元帅“给国家一些安静”！
    蒙哥马利元帅免不了声名狼籍这是因为他决不是反共“十字军”的首创者。在历史上，希特勒是这种“十字军”的组织者，而当时蒙哥马利不过是被希特勒
  “国防军”吓得发抖的人。在现在“十字军”的新的组织者是五角大楼的人物，而蒙哥马利不过是美国将军们指挥下摇旗呐喊的一名小卒。
    不过，无论怎么样，蒙哥马利元帅过去是看到了希特勒的结局的，现在他也决不会比五角大楼的主人知道得差些：原子战争不是好玩的。中国有句古话说：“识时务者为俊杰”，蒙哥马利元帅还是冷静一点吧！（煊）
