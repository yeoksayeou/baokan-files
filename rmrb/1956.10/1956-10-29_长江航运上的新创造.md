Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 27th: Zhang Shucheng, a staff member of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration, recently created a new tool called a drag parachute for inland waterway fleets. After numerous tests, it has been proven that when fleets use this tool, turning is faster and more maneuverable, and the turning diameter can also be reduced.

The drag parachute is a hemispherical, parachute-like device made of canvas. When this tool is attached to both sides of the foremost barge in a fleet with wire ropes, to turn, for example, to the right, the right drag parachute is dropped; to turn to the left, the left drag parachute is dropped. Because the drag parachute opens up in the water and generates resistance, coupled with the action of the propeller and rudder at the rear of the fleet, the fleet will turn quickly.

In recent years, with the development of the shipping industry, fleets navigating the Yangtze River often consist of a tugboat plus four, five, or even six or seven barges. This has created difficulties with insufficient rudder power and inflexible maneuvering, especially when turning. Since last year, the number of accidents involving fleets running aground on the banks of the river in winding waterways due to inflexible maneuvering has gradually increased on the Yangtze River. The use of drag parachutes can reduce these accidents.

    长江航运上的新创造
    新华社武汉27日电　长江航运管理局工作人员张书城，最近为内河船队创制了一种名叫阻力伞的新工具。经过多次试验证明，船队使用这种工具后，调头时迅速、灵便，回转的直径也可以缩小。
    阻力伞是一种半球形的用帆布制成的像降落伞样的东西。船队最前面的一条驳船两旁各用铅丝绳系上这种工具后，要调头时，如向右转可抛下右边的阻力伞，向左转抛下左面的阻力伞。因为阻力伞抛到水里张开后会产生阻力，加上船队后面的推进器和舵的作用，船队就会迅速转向。
    近几年来随着航运事业的发展，航行长江的船队往往是一条拖轮加上四、五条甚至六、七条驳船。这就产生了舵力不够，操纵不灵的困难，尤其是在调头时这种困难更大。去年以来，长江上的船队因为操纵不灵活在弯曲水道发生触岸坡的事故逐渐增多。使用阻力伞以后就可以减少这种事故。
