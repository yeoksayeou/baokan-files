Xinhua News Agency, Tangier, 30th: The nine-nation conference deciding the future status of Tangier concluded on October 29th. The conference reached an agreement to return the administrative, legislative, and judicial organs of Tangier, which has been an international zone since 1925, to Morocco, but to maintain its current economic and financial system.

The final communiqué of the conference, signed by representatives of Morocco, the United States, Britain, France, Spain, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, and Portugal, stated that the residents of Tangier will continue to enjoy various privileges, including tax exemption and free exchange of foreign currencies.

Reports say that the Sultan of Morocco will soon promulgate a charter establishing a new economic system in Tangier, but this new system will not differ much from the current one.

    丹吉尔归还摩洛哥问题达成协议
    九国会议决定移交行政、立法和司法机构
    新华社30日讯　丹吉尔消息：决定丹吉尔未来地位的九国会议已经在10月29日结束。会议达成协议，决定把这个从1925年就成为国际区的丹吉尔的行政、立法和司法机构交还摩洛哥，但是要保持它目前的经济和财政制度。
    由摩洛哥、美国、英国、法国、西班牙、比利时、意大利、荷兰和葡萄牙九国代表签署的会议最后公报说，丹吉尔居民将继续享有包括免税、自由兑换外币在内的种种特权。
    有消息说，摩洛哥苏丹不久将颁布一项宪章，在丹吉尔建立新的经济制度，但是这种新的制度同目前的制度没有多大差别。
