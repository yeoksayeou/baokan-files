    Ideological Work Must Be Strengthened
    He Qing

    The inland areas of Yunnan Province will basically achieve socialist agricultural cooperativization after the autumn harvest.

    From the investigation materials from various regions, it can be seen that: At present, in areas with a relatively good foundation, a blindly complacent mood is quite prevalent among grassroots cadres. During the rectification of cooperatives, there is a lack of in-depth understanding of the ideological dynamics of the masses, insufficient research into the planning of cooperative transformation, the selection and training of key personnel, and propaganda and education work. Some have not even considered these issues. Therefore, there is a lack of sufficient effort in both ideological and organizational preparation. Cadres in Lijiang Prefecture and Zhanyi County believe that advanced agricultural production cooperatives must have five or six hundred to more than a thousand households; it is meaningless to have smaller ones. Xichou County has many mountainous areas, but they still want one cooperative per township. Yangqiao Township in Songming County has more than 1,200 households, and the work foundation is not very good, but the branch secretary requested one cooperative for the entire township. The county party committee persuaded the branch to establish three cooperatives, but the branch secretary did not understand. In areas with this kind of blindly complacent mood, the work is often not meticulous and pragmatic enough, and there is very little consultation with the masses. In those remote areas, mountainous or semi-mountainous areas where there are still fewer advanced cooperatives, cadres have a fear of difficulty. They feel that they have no experience, and it is difficult to lead primary cooperatives, let alone advanced cooperatives. They are waiting for higher authorities to dispatch cadres.

    This year's cooperative transformation in Yunnan is mostly in semi-mountainous areas and areas where various ethnic groups live together. Because the masses do not have enough understanding of the policies, there are still many concerns in their minds. For example, some cooperatives have already had the phenomenon of retaining more land and distributing less land in the trial distribution, which has affected the normal public accumulation. Some cooperatives are only willing to engage in short-term profitable sideline businesses. For example, they only raise breeding pigs and are unwilling to raise piglets because they are afraid of suffering losses in the cooperative transformation. Farmers have even more concerns about the disposal of the means of production. Mountainous farmers worry about difficulties in life after mountain fields, forests, and livestock are brought into the cooperative. Ethnic minority farmers are worried that the valuation of cattle and horses will not be reasonable after they are brought into the cooperative, and the phenomenon of selling at low prices has already been discovered. In Hehua Township, Zhaotong County, the number of horses sold recently has accounted for 20% of the entire township. The Miao people in the Qujing area are worried that after the cooperatives are merged, cadres of their own ethnic group will not participate in the leadership, and they are also afraid that the work points will be reduced when mixed with the Han people.

    These concerns of the masses show that ideological work for cooperative transformation must be in-depth and meticulous, and organizational preparation must be sufficient. Specific policy issues and cooperative transformation steps should be thoroughly researched based on the different situations of different ethnic groups. The view that blindly complacency simplifies the problem has no basis whatsoever.

    思想工作必须加强
    禾青
    云南省内地在秋后将基本实现社会主义的农业合作化。
    从各地的调查材料中可以看出：当前在基础较好的地区，基层干部中盲目自满的情绪相当普遍。在整社中间对群众的思想动态不作深入的了解，对转社的规划、骨干的选择和培养以及宣传教育工作钻研不够，有的甚至还没有考虑这些问题，因此在思想准备和组织准备上都缺乏足够的努力。丽江专区和沾益县的干部认为，要办高级农业生产合作社就得五、六百户到一千多户，办小了就没有意思；西畴县山区多，但是仍想一乡一社；嵩明县的杨桥乡有一千二百多户，工作基础并不很好，但支部书记要求全乡一社，县委说服支部分办三个社，支书却思想不通。凡是有这种盲目情绪的地区，工作往往不够细致踏实，也很少和群众商量。而在那些地处僻远，现在高级社还较少的山区或半山区，干部又存在着恐惧心理，他们感到自己没有经验，领导初级社都有困难，转高级社就更不知如何是好，他们等待上级调派干部。
    云南今年转社，大多数是半山区和民族杂居地区，由于群众对政策还不够了解，思想上还存在不少顾虑。如有的社在试算分配中已有过多地少留多分的现象，影响了正常的公共积累；有的社只愿经营短期能够收益的副业。例如只养架子猪，而不愿再养小猪，怕转社吃亏。农民对于生产资料的处理，顾虑更是多端，山区农民担心山场、山林、牲畜入社以后生活困难。少数民族农民因恐牛、马入社折价不能合理，已发现低价出卖的现象，昭通县荷花乡最近出卖的马匹已占全乡的20％。曲靖地区的苗族担心并社以后没有本民族的干部参加领导，又怕和汉族混合编队工分减少。
    群众的这些顾虑，说明转社的思想工作必须深入细致，组织准备必须充分。而具体政策问题和转社步骤更应根据不同民族的情况作切实的研究。盲目自满把问题简单化的看法是没有任何根据的。
