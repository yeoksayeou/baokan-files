    Pakistan's Prime Minister, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, departed from Karachi on October 16th to visit our country. Their visit is a significant event in the history of friendly relations between China and Pakistan.
    The word "Pakistan" originates from the Persian words "Pak" – meaning "pure, sacred" – and "Stan" – meaning "country." The literal translation is "Land of the Pure." As early as 1930, the renowned Islamic poet Muhammad Iqbal put forward the concept of "Pakistan" as a religious ideal, hoping to unite Muslims in the Indian subcontinent to form "Pakistan." In 1940, the All-India Muslim League, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, decided to adopt this religious ideal as its political goal. In August 1947, Pakistan and India separately declared independence, becoming dominions of the British Commonwealth. On March 23rd of this year, Pakistan relinquished its dominion status and became an independent Islamic Republic within the Commonwealth.
    The partition of India and Pakistan was carried out based on the principle of allocating Muslim-majority areas to Pakistan. Therefore, Pakistan has a unique geographical characteristic unlike any other country in the world. Its territory is divided into two unconnected parts: West Pakistan Province in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent, and East Pakistan Province in the northeast of the Indian subcontinent. The two are more than 1,700 kilometers apart. If traveling by sea, it is even further, with a route length of over 5,600 kilometers.
    West Pakistan is located in the Indus River basin, bordering India, Iran, and Afghanistan, and is very close to Xinjiang, China. The lower reaches of the Indus River are one of the birthplaces of ancient civilization. According to archaeologists, urban culture existed here as early as 3000 BC. Peshawar and Lahore, the provincial capital of West Pakistan, are both famous ancient cultural cities. Karachi, the capital of Pakistan, is also located in West Pakistan. It is West Pakistan's main seaport and an important international air transport hub with a population of over 1.2 million. West Pakistan has a hot, dry climate with little rainfall, and the terrain is high in the west and low in the east. The province has a total area of 800,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 34 million.
    East Pakistan is located in the Ganges and Brahmaputra River basins. These two major rivers have formed one of the world's largest deltas. The area has a dense network of rivers, and the monsoon climate results in hot, humid conditions and abundant rainfall. Arable land accounts for 75% of the province's land area. East Pakistan borders India and Myanmar and is also very close to Tibet, China. Although its total area is only about 140,000 square kilometers, its population reaches 42 million. Dhaka, the provincial capital of East Pakistan, is the political and cultural center of East Pakistan and has been a textile center since ancient times.
    More than 85% of Pakistan's national residents are Muslim, and 13% are Hindu. Travelers in Pakistan can see mosques of varying sizes in the residential areas of every major city, with many worshippers performing prayers inside. These scenes particularly demonstrate the character of this Islamic country. Pakistan's new constitution stipulates that all laws of the country must not conflict with the Quran, and the head of state – the President – must also be a Muslim.
    Pakistanis often say their country has three "mosts." The first "most" is the largest jute production, accounting for 60% of the world's total production. Jute is Pakistan's main export product, accounting for about 50% of its total export value. Jute production is concentrated in East Pakistan. The second "most" is the highest population density in East Pakistan, with an average of nearly 300 people per square kilometer. The third "most" is the hottest climate in Jacobabad, West Pakistan, where the maximum annual temperature reaches around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
    In addition to jute, Pakistan's cotton is also renowned in the world market. Its cotton production accounts for about 6% of the world's total, and most of it is high-quality long-staple cotton. Other major agricultural products of Pakistan include tea, rice, and wheat.
    Pakistan has rich mineral resources, with natural gas, chromium, petroleum, and iron being the most abundant. The natural gas reserves in the Sui region of West Pakistan are estimated to be over 70 billion cubic meters, capable of supplying over 3 million cubic meters per day for 50 to 100 years. Pakistan is also a major producer of the rare metal chromium, with an annual chromite ore production of over 20,000 tons.
    However, this country with rich resources and 76 million hardworking people is not affluent. Long-term colonial rule has left its economy in a backward state. Until now, its industry is still underdeveloped, and most of the existing industrial and mining enterprises are controlled by foreign capital. For example, the oil deposits in Punjab are being exploited by the British Attock Oil Company and the Pakistan Petroleum Limited, which is dominated by British capital. The rights to exploit natural gas also belong to Pakistan Petroleum Limited. Two of the three companies mining chromite ore are British companies. Foreign capital has also extended to foreign trade, shipping, banking, insurance, and agriculture. For example, 90% of the total investment in Pakistan's tea plantations is British capital.
    Since its founding, Pakistan has made some progress in overcoming the evils left over from the colonial period. When India and Pakistan were first partitioned, this country, which ranked first in the world in jute production, did not even have a single jute factory. Now, East Pakistan has 5,000 new-style jute looms. Other industries such as cotton and wool textiles, sugar production, oil pressing, paper making, tobacco, matches, leather, and rubber have also developed. The Pakistani government also formulated a six-year development plan for 1951-57, with a total investment of approximately 2.6 billion rupees. As a result of the implementation of the six-year plan, by 1955, thermal power generation capacity had increased to 197,000 kilowatts, and hydroelectric power generation capacity had increased to 63,000 kilowatts. At the time of the partition of India and Pakistan, its thermal power generation capacity was only 61,000 kilowatts, and its hydroelectric power generation capacity was only 11,000 kilowatts. Progress has also been made in agricultural development plans.
    According to Pakistan's new constitution, the head of state is the president, who is elected by the parliament. The government adopts a cabinet system, with the prime minister appointed by the president and responsible to the parliament. The parliament is a unicameral National Assembly, composed of 300 members, with East and West Pakistan each accounting for half. The constitution also stipulates that Pakistan is a federation, with power divided between the central government and the provinces. The central government holds power over foreign affairs, defense, and currency issuance, while East and West Pakistan each have autonomy. Bengali and Urdu were declared national languages, but English will continue to be used as the official language for twenty years. The current (and first) President of Pakistan is Iskander Mirza. The current Prime Minister, Suhrawardy, was sworn in on September 12th of this year.
    Pakistan is one of the founding countries of the Asian-African Conference, and it is also a member of the Manila Pact and the Baghdad Pact. In recent years, the Pakistani people have strongly demanded the pursuit of an independent foreign policy. Since taking office as Prime Minister, Suhrawardy has repeatedly stated that Pakistan will pursue an independent foreign policy. He announced: "We urgently hope to be friendly with all countries, especially with our neighbors and our Muslim brothers." He said that the principle of Pakistan's new foreign policy is: "Goodwill towards all countries, malice towards none." Prime Minister Suhrawardy has expressed his distress that Pakistan cannot yet be independent of foreign aid. He said that he is grateful for foreign aid, but he stated that "at no time will we sacrifice our freedom for the sake of foreign aid."
    The friendly exchanges between the ancestors of the Chinese people and the ancestors of the Pakistani people began many centuries ago. The Chinese Tang Dynasty monk Xuanzang once visited the area that is now West Pakistan, and the scenic spot of Taxila in northern West Pakistan still bears signs of his visit. The Bengal region, where East Pakistan is located, was a frequent destination for ancient Chinese merchant ships. The fleets led by the Chinese Ming Dynasty navigators Zheng He and Hou Xian also visited Bengal. Hou Xian and Fei Xin were also sent by the Ming emperor as envoys to Bengal. This friendly visit led to constant dispatches of envoys to China during the reign of the Bengal King Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah. Not long after the founding of the People's Republic of China, on January 5, 1950, the Pakistani government announced its willingness to establish diplomatic relations with our country. In 1951, the two countries formally established diplomatic relations. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, economic and cultural exchanges have developed. Several agreements and contracts have been signed for our country to purchase Pakistani cotton and for Pakistan to purchase Chinese coal and rice. The leaders of the two governments also had friendly contacts during the Bandung Conference. From January to February this year, Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling visited Pakistan at the invitation of the Pakistani government. In March this year, Vice Premier He Long attended the inauguration ceremony of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. These visits and contacts have promoted understanding and friendship between the two countries. Now, Prime Minister Suhrawardy is about to arrive in our country, and further development of the good friendly relations between China and Pakistan, these two friendly neighboring countries, can be expected.

### 我国西南方的邻邦巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国

    我国西南方的邻邦巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国
    巴基斯坦总理侯赛恩·沙希德·苏拉瓦底已经在10月16日由喀喇蚩动身来我国访问，他们的访问是中巴两国友好关系史上的一件大事。
    “巴基斯坦”这个词的字源出自波斯文的“巴基”——意思是“清真、神圣”——和“斯坦”——意思是“国家”，按字义来翻译就是“清真国”。还在1930年的时候，伊斯兰教著名诗人穆罕默德·伊克巴尔把“巴基斯坦”这个观念作为宗教上的理想提了出来，他希望能把在印度次大陆上的穆斯林集合起来组成“巴基斯坦”。1940年，以穆罕默德·阿里·真纳为首的全印穆斯林联盟决定把这个宗教理想作为它的政治目标。1947年8月，巴基斯坦和印度一起分别宣布独立，成为英联邦的自治领。今年3月23日，巴基斯坦又脱离了自治领的地位，成为一个在英联邦范围内的独立的伊斯兰共和国。
    印度和巴基斯坦的分治是按照把穆斯林聚居区划归巴基斯坦的原则进行的，所以，巴基斯坦在地理上据有和世界上任何一个国家都不同的特点，它的领土分为互不连接的东、西两部分，西巴基斯坦省在印度次大陆的西北部，东巴基斯坦省在印度次大陆的东北部，两者相距一千七百多公里，如果走海路的话，那就更远了，航线长度达五千六百多公里。
    西巴基斯坦在印度河流域，与印度、伊朗、阿富汗相邻，和我国的新疆十分接近。印度河的下游地区是世界古代文明的发祥地之一，据考古学家的研究，远在公元前三千年左右，这里就有了城市文化。西巴基斯坦的白沙瓦和省会拉合尔都是著名的文化古城。巴基斯坦的首都喀喇蚩也在西巴基斯坦，它是西巴的主要海港，并且是国际航空运输的重要转运站，全市人口有一百二十多万。西巴基斯坦地区的气候干热少雨，地势西部高而东部低，全省总面积是八十万平方公里，人口约三千四百万。
    东巴基斯坦在恒河和布拉马普特拉河流域，这两条大河把这里冲积成世界上最大的三角洲之一，这里河网密布，加上季候风的影响，所以气候湿热多雨，耕地面积达到全省土地的75％。东巴基斯坦和印度、缅甸接壤，而且距我国西藏也极近。它的总面积虽然只有约十四万平方公里，人口则达到四千二百万人。东巴省会达卡是东巴的政治、文化中心，它在古代就是一个纺织业的中心了。
    巴基斯坦的全国居民中有85％以上信奉伊斯兰教，13％信奉印度教。在巴基斯坦旅行的人能够看到在每个重要城市的居民区都有着大小不同的清真寺，有许多信徒在里面礼拜，这些情景特别显示出这个伊斯兰国家的风貌。在巴基斯坦的新宪法中规定，国家的一切法律都不得同古兰经相违背，国家的元首——总统也必须由伊斯兰教徒担任。
    巴基斯坦人常说他们的国家有三“最”。第一个“最”是黄麻产量最多，它的黄麻产量占世界总产量的60％，是巴基斯坦的主要出口产品，占出口总值的50％左右。黄麻的产地集中在东巴基斯坦。第二个“最”是东巴基斯坦的人口最密，平均每平方公里的人口近三百人。第三个“最”是西巴基斯坦的贾科巴巴德的气候最热，每年的最高气温达到华氏一百四十度左右。
    除了黄麻而外，巴基斯坦的棉花也是驰名于世界市场的，它的棉花产量约占世界总产量的6％，而且大都是长纤维的优质棉。此外，巴基斯坦的主要农产品还有茶叶、大米和小麦等。
    巴基斯坦有着丰富的矿藏，其中以天然气、铬、石油和铁为最多。在西巴基斯坦苏伊地区的天然气蕴藏量估计有七百多亿立方公尺，可以在五十到一百年内每天供应三百多万立方公尺。巴基斯坦也是稀有金属铬的主要出产国之一，铬砂的年产量约有二万多吨。
    但是，这个拥有丰富的资源和七千六百万勤劳的人民的国家却并不是富足的，长期的殖民统治使它的经济处于落后境地中。直到目前，它的工业还很不发达，已有的工矿企业也大部分为外国资本所控制。举例来说，在旁遮普的石油矿藏是由英国阿托克石油公司和英国资本占支配地位的巴基斯坦石油有限公司在开采的；天然气的开采权也属于巴基斯坦石油有限公司；开采铬矿的三家公司中就有两家是英国公司。外国资本还伸展到对外贸易、航运、银行、保险业和农业方面，例如，在巴基斯坦茶叶种植园的总投资中，就有90％是英国资本。
    巴基斯坦从建国以来在克服殖民统治时期所遗留下来的恶果方面已经取得一些进展。在印度和巴基斯坦刚刚分治的时候，这个在世界上占第一位的黄麻出产国连一家黄麻工厂都没有，现在东巴基斯坦已经有了五千架新式黄麻织机；其他像棉毛纺织业、制糖业、榨油、造纸、烟草、火柴、皮革、橡胶等业也都有了发展。巴基斯坦政府并且制订了一项1951—57年的六年发展计划，总投资额约二十六亿卢比，六年计划执行的结果，到1955年，火力发电能力已经增加到十九万七千瓩，水力发电能力增加到六万三千瓩；而在印、巴分治时，它的火力发电能力只有六万一千瓩，水力发电能力只有一万一千瓩。在农业发展计划方面也有了进展。
    根据巴基斯坦新宪法的规定，国家的元首是总统，由议会选出；政府采用内阁制，内阁总理由总统任命并且向议会负责；议会是一院制的国民议会，由三百名议员组成，东、西巴基斯坦各占半数。宪法还规定，巴基斯坦为联邦制，中央与各省分权，中央握有外交、国防和货币发行权，东、西巴基斯坦各有自治权。孟加拉语和乌尔都语被宣布为国语，但是在二十年内英语仍被用为官方语言。巴基斯坦现任总统（也是第一任总统）是伊斯坎德尔·米尔扎。现任内阁总理苏拉瓦底是在今年9月12日宣誓就任的。
    巴基斯坦是亚非会议的发起国之一，它又是马尼拉条约集团和巴格达条约的成员国。近年以来，巴基斯坦人民强烈地要求奉行独立的外交政策。苏拉瓦底在就任总理职务后曾一再声明，巴基斯坦将奉行独立的外交政策。他宣布：“我们迫切希望同一切国家友好，主要是同我们的邻国和我们的穆斯林兄弟友好。”他说，巴基斯坦新的外交政策的原则是：“对一切国家怀抱善意，对谁也不抱恶意。”苏拉瓦底总理曾经表示他对目前巴基斯坦还不能脱离外援而自主的情况感到痛苦。他说，他感谢外国的援助，但是他表示“在任何时候都不会为了外援而牺牲我国的自由。”
    中国人民的祖先和巴基斯坦人民的祖先的友好交往早在许多世纪以前就开始了。中国唐代高僧玄奘就曾到过现在是西巴基斯坦的地方，在西巴北部的游览胜地塔克赛拉现在还留有他到过的标志。东巴基斯坦所在的孟加拉地区是中国古代商船常到的地方。中国明代航海家郑和、侯显率领的船队也到过孟加拉，侯显和费信还被明朝皇帝派为出使孟加拉的使节，这种友好的访问，导致了孟加拉国王厄雅素丁在位时不断遣使聘问中国。中华人民共和国成立后不久，在1950年1月5日巴基斯坦政府即宣布愿与我国建立外交关系，1951年两国正式建立了外交关系。两国建交后，经济和文化交往都有了发展，曾经先后签订了几项我国购买巴基斯坦棉花和巴基斯坦购买我国的煤和大米的协定和合同。两国政府领导人在万隆会议期间也进行了友好的接触；今年1月到2月，宋庆龄副委员长应邀访问了巴基斯坦，今年3月，贺龙副总理参加了巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国成立典礼；这些访问和接触都促进了两国的了解和友谊。现在，苏拉瓦底总理即将到达我国，中国和巴基斯坦这两个友邻国家良好的友谊关系取得进一步的发展是可以预期的。    （新华社）
