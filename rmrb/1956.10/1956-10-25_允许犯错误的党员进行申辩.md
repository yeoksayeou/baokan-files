The Party Constitution stipulates: "When a Party organization discusses and decides on disciplinary action against a Party member, the Party member concerned should be notified to attend the meeting and allowed to defend himself, except in special circumstances. After the decision on disciplinary action is passed, the reasons for the disciplinary action should be notified to the Party member concerned." However, some Party organizations, especially some grassroots Party organizations, often neglect this due right of erring Party members and are unwilling to listen to their defenses. When discussing and deciding on disciplinary action against Party members, some do not allow them to attend the meeting at all, or although they allow them to attend the meeting, they do not allow them to speak. Some do not even show them the disciplinary decision. In November 1955, a Party member in Qingshan Township, Yizheng County, Jiangsu Province, was expelled from the Party for making mistakes, but the township branch neither announced it at the branch meeting nor gave the expulsion decision to the person concerned. Later, this Party member repeatedly asked the district committee for a chance to defend himself, but the district committee considered him to be "resisting investigation" and "trying to quibble," and did not pay attention to it. However, after a review by the county Party's Discipline Inspection Commission, the facts turned out to be very different, and he should not have been expelled from the Party at all. In 1952, the Guangduo Township Branch in Binhai County, Jiangsu Province, disciplined a Party member, but did not notify the person concerned until 1955.

Because some Party organizations are unwilling to listen to the opinions of erring Party members and do not respect their rights, they often draw conclusions subjectively and one-sidedly when dealing with their mistakes, which inevitably leads to errors. According to a recent investigation by the Jiangsu Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission of the CCP in the Mapeng, Dongdun and other township branches in Gaoyou County, it was found that these three townships had successively disciplined 124 Party members in various central tasks such as combining production, land reform review, grain procurement and sales, and Party rectification. Among them, 43 were improperly disciplined, including 32 who should not have been disciplined at all, and 11 whose punishments were too severe. Of course, there are many reasons for this serious deviation, but one of the main reasons is that the Party organization did not patiently listen to the defenses of the erring Party members when disciplining them.

Obviously, the examples cited above are contrary to the Party Constitution and the Party's organizational principles. It not only fails to achieve the positive purpose of educating erring Party members and other Party members, but may even politically harm comrades and damage the interests of the Party. Therefore, it deserves the serious attention of grassroots Party organizations.

    允许犯错误的党员进行申辩
    钱文剑
    党章规定：“党的组织讨论和决定对于一个党员的处分，除了本人特殊情形以外，应当通知受处分的到会，进行辩护。在通过处分的决议以后，应当把处分的理由通知受处分的本人。”但是有些党的组织，特别是某些党的基层组织，往往忽视了犯错误党员这种应有的权利，不愿意听取犯错误的党员的申辩；在讨论和决定党员的处分的时候，有的根本不吸收他们参加会议，或者虽然吸收他们参加会议但不让他们发言，有的甚至连处分决定也不给他们看。江苏仪征县青山乡有一个党员在1955年11月因犯错误被开除了党籍，但乡支部既没有在支部会上宣布，也没有将处分决议交给本人看。后来这个党员曾先后几次向区委要求申辩，反被区委认为他是“抗拒检查”、“百般狡赖”，而不予重视。但是经该县党的监察委员会复查的结果，事实情节却有很大出入，根本不应该开除他的党籍。江苏滨海县广垛乡支部1952年处分了一个党员，但直到1955年才通知本人。
    由于有些党的组织不愿倾听犯错误的党员的意见，不尊重党员的权利，因而在处理党员的错误时，往往主观片面地轻下结论，这就必然要发生错误。据中共江苏省监察委员会最近去高邮县马棚、东墩等乡支部的调查，发现这三个乡在结合生产、土改复查、粮食统购统销及整党等各项中心工作中，先后处分了一百二十四个党员，而处分不当的就有四十三人，其中不应当给予处分的三十二人，处分偏重的十一人。当然，产生这种严重偏差的情况是多方面的，但其中主要原因之一是因为党组织在处分党员时没有很耐心地倾听犯错误党员的申辩。
    很显然，上面举出的事例是与党章和党的组织原则相违背的，它不仅不能达到教育犯错误党员和其他党员的积极目的，甚至会在政治上伤害同志，损害党的利益。因此，值得引起层基党组织的严重注意。
