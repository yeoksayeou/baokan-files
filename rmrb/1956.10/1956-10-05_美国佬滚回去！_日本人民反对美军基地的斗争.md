“Yankees Go Home!”
——The Struggle of the Japanese People Against US Military Bases——
Lan Hai

At 8:00 AM on August 27th, in front of the US Naval Base in Yokosuka, the Stars and Stripes was about to be hoisted to the top of the flagpole amidst the music of the US military band. At this moment, a thousand Japanese workers, hand in hand, surrounding the base gate, began a chorus of "Song of the National Independence Action Team." Their majestic singing instantly drowned out the music of the US military band. The American Stars and Stripes also paled in comparison to the dozens of imposing red union flags.

None of the 14,000 Japanese workers who usually work at this base went to work that day. They had all gone on a general strike from zero hours that day. The neatly arranged demonstration in front of the base gate was precisely the picket line of the base workers' strike group. Action teams from thirty unions in the factories surrounding the base came to support them.

At precisely the same time, in front of the US Far East Command headquarters in Fuchu, a suburb of Tokyo, more than 500 worker picketers waving large red flags appeared. They held hands tightly, shouting, "Hey! Hey! Yankees go home!" They demonstrated with a serpentine formation, winding forward. Nearby farmers came out to wave flags and cheer them on. Conversely, inside the base gate, besides the American military guards with rifles in hand, dumbfounded and pale, not a single person could be seen. Only some Americans gathered in the command headquarters building far from the gate, using binoculars to scout the scene in front of the gate.

On August 27th, such scenes occurred at US military bases all over Japan, from Hokkaido in the north to Kyushu in the south, including US military airfields, depots, barracks, hospitals, naval ports, and armories. The total number of Japanese workers engaged in labor at US military bases is 177,000, of which 90,000 are members of the "All-Japan Garrison Forces Labor Union" (a member union of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan), and 13,000 are members of the "Japan Garrison Forces Labor Union" (a member union of the All-Japan Trade Union Congress). These two unions joined together this time and absorbed some unorganized workers, totaling 158,000 people, and held a 24-hour general strike on this day. This caused the supply of military supplies, mail distribution, hospital operations, and kitchen work in the US military bases, which had lost their workers, to be paralyzed in an instant.

This struggle of the base workers was to oppose the "New Sanctions Regulations."

In July of this year, the US military authorities and the Procurement Agency of the Japanese government (an organization dedicated to supplying materials needed by the US military) formulated the so-called "New Sanctions Regulations." They wanted to use these regulations to arbitrarily dismiss Japanese workers who were disliked by the US military authorities, and further attempt to arbitrarily suppress all resistance from Japanese workers, in order to strengthen the military control of the bases.

The land of our motherland must not be trampled by the Yankees, and Japanese workers will not be the horses and cattle of the Yankees. With the support of the people of the whole country, the base workers heroically stood up and demanded the abolition of the "New Sanctions Regulations." The general strike on August 27th was only the beginning of this struggle. The base workers of Japan are determined that if the US military authorities do not accept their demands, they will hold a second, third, fourth... strike, and fight indefinitely.

At the same time, the struggle of the Japanese people against the expansion of US military bases is expanding. The recently published "Price Proposal" has clearly exposed the US attempt to strengthen atomic war bases. On the one hand, it is expanding the military base on Okinawa Island, and on the other hand, it is actively expanding airfields in Japan such as Yokota, Tachikawa (Sunagawa), Kisarazu, and Komaki. Under the pressure of the United States, although the Japanese government promised to fulfill the US demands in June of this year, up to now, apart from the land issue of the Yokota base, which was forcibly realized after several twists and turns, there is no solution to other base issues.

Inspired by the staunch struggle of the farmers in Sunagawa, the Japanese people, in order to unite the nationwide struggle against military bases, established the "National Liaison Council Against Bases" in June last year, which has received widespread support from mass organizations such as the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the "Round-Table Conference on Base Issues of the Japanese Cultural Circle," strengthening the strength of the struggle.

The unrelenting resistance struggle of the farmers in Sunagawa and the Japanese people who support them has made the Japanese government feel helpless. Therefore, the Japanese government decided to use the land expropriation law stipulated in the "Japan-US Administrative Agreement" to forcibly occupy the farmers' land, and therefore instructed the mayor of Sunagawa Village to publish the government's decision to the local people. However, the mayor of Sunagawa Village, Denzaemon Miyazaki, announced on July 27, the last day of the deadline for publishing the announcement, "As a mayor, standing on the position of respecting the will of the residents, even if I am nailed to the cross and stabbed to death, I will not issue an announcement for the expropriation of land." He resolutely rejected the instructions given to him by the government in this way.

Akiyoshidai in Yamaguchi Prefecture is a famous scenic spot in Japan. The US military wanted to use this place as a bombing range for their bombers, which aroused the resistance of the people of the whole prefecture. The Science Council of Japan publicly stated that this area is a region that needs to be preserved academically and opposed it being used as a practice range.

Since the Japanese Defense Agency announced in August last year that it would use Lake Kami in Ibaraki Prefecture as a base for anti-submarine reconnaissance aircraft, the resistance of the people of the whole prefecture has never stopped, preventing the implementation of this plan. On August 20th this year, a grand anti-resistance struggle meeting was held under the leadership of thirty-four prefectural representatives, expressing their determination to continue the fight.

At present, in any place in Japan, not only is it not allowed to expand military bases by even an inch, but even elementary school students have issued calls for "abolishing military bases" and "Yankees go home." This year, on the Qixi Festival, according to custom, children wrote their wishes on colored paper strips and hung them on bamboo branches. The first wish written by the children around the military base was "Yankees go home."

The 800,000 people of Okinawa Island have been bravely struggling to oppose the permanent occupation of Okinawa by the United States. The US authorities disregarded everything and wanted to intimidate them with threats. On July 12th, 13th, and 14th, the United States used aircraft to spray gasoline on 300,000 tsubo (approximately one million square meters) of farmland on Ie Island in Okinawa, burning down windbreaks, sweet potatoes, beets, and peanuts, and announced the cessation of the annual grant of one million US dollars to the University of the Ryukyus on the grounds that students of the university shouted "Yankees go home." The US military authorities also announced a ban on the US military buying Okinawan goods in the central part of the island. However, the threats and suppression of the US military not only failed to undermine the unity of the people of Okinawa Island, but on the contrary, made the flames of struggle even more intense. In order to prohibit the people of Okinawa Island from holding meetings, the US military issued a military order saying: "Any use of school grounds for meetings must be approved by the city education committee." However, the city education committee composed of representatives of Okinawa citizens disregarded the orders of the US military authorities and issued an order saying: "School grounds can be used by citizens indefinitely until victory is achieved in the struggle to demand the withdrawal (of the Price Proposal)." The unity of the struggle organization of the people of Okinawa Island—the Okinawa Land Protection Council—is becoming more and more consolidated. The Five Organizations Council dealing with the United States (including the Civil Government, the Legislative Council, the Land Federation, the Mayors Association, and the Chairmen of the Municipal and Village Assemblies) is receiving stronger and stronger support. The "National Movement Liaison Council for Resolving the Okinawa Issue" in Tokyo is also growing, and more and more people are participating.

At present, the Japanese people have recognized from the bottom of their hearts who is hindering them from building an independent, peaceful, and democratic new Japan, and who is pushing the hard-working Japanese people into the fire pit! The slogan "Yankees go home!" has become a strong cry of the broad masses of the Japanese people. (Attached picture)

    “美国佬滚回去！”
    ——日本人民反对美军基地的斗争——
    蓝海
    8月27日早晨8时，在横须贺的美国海军基地的大门前，在美国军乐队的乐声中，星条旗正要升上最高的一根旗杆。这时候，一千名手挽着手、围绕在基地大门前的日本工人们开始了“民族独立行动队之歌”的大合唱。他们的雄壮的歌声，转瞬之间就把美国军乐队的乐声压倒。美国星条旗在几十面威风凛凛的红色工会大旗前面，也顿然失色。
    平日在这个基地内做工的一万四千名日本工人，这天没有一个人上工。他们从当天零时开始，一齐进入了总罢工。而整整齐齐地排列在基地大门前示威的队伍，正是基地工人罢工团的纠察队。这里边有基地周围工厂三十个工会的行动队前来助威。
    恰恰在同一个时间，在东京郊外府中地方的美国远东军司令部的大门前，出现了五百多名挥舞着红色大旗的工人纠察队员。他们紧紧地手挽着手，高呼着“嘿！嘿！美国佬滚回去！”他们用弯曲前进的蛇行队形进行示威。近处的农民们都出来为他们摇旗呐喊。相反的，在基地大门内，除了手握步枪、目瞪口呆、面无人色的美军门岗以外，看不见一个人影。只有在远离大门的司令部大楼里有一些美国佬聚集在一起，用望远镜侦察着大门前的景象。
    8月27日这一天，从日本北边的北海道直到南边的九州，遍及日本全国的美军机场、兵站、营房、医院、军港、火药库等美军基地，都发生了这样的情景。在美军基地内从事劳动的日本工人总数有十七万七千人，其中有九万人组成了“全驻军工会”（日本工会总评议会的加盟工会），另有一万三千人组成了“日本驻军工会”
  （全日本工会会议的加盟工会）。这两个工会这次联合在一起，并吸收了一些没有组织的工人，共有十五万八千人，在这一天举行了二十四小时总罢工。这使得失去了工人的美军基地的军需品的输送、信件的分发、医院的业务、炊事部门的工作等，转瞬之间就陷入瘫痪状态。
    这次基地工人的斗争，是为了反对“新制裁规定”。
   今年7月，美军当局和日本政府的调达厅（专为供应美军所需物资的机构）制定了所谓“新制裁规定”。他们想利用这一规定来随意解雇美军当局所不满意的日本工人，进而企图任意镇压日本工人的一切反抗，达到加强基地的军事统治的目的。
    祖国的土地不许美国佬来蹂躏，日本工人不作美国佬的牛马。基地工人在全国人民的支持下，英勇地站起来要求撤销“新制裁规定”。8月27日的总罢工只不过是这一斗争的开始。日本的基地工人们已经下了决心，如果美军当局不接受他们的要求，他们将举行第二次、第三次、第四次……的罢工，无限期地斗争下去。
    与此同时，日本人民反对美军扩充军事基地的斗争正在扩大。不久前发表的
  “普赖斯建议”，已经明显地暴露了美国企图加强原子战争基地的野心。它一方面正在扩充冲绳岛的军事基地，一方面又在积极扩大在日本的横田、立川（砂川）、木更津、小牧等飞机场。在美国的压力下，日本政府虽然答应在今年6月里能够实现美国的要求，但是到今天为止，除了横田基地的土地问题经过几番周折强制实现了以外，其它基地问题还没有丝毫解决的办法。
    受到砂川农民坚强斗争的启示，日本人民为了统一全国反对军事基地的斗争，去年6月成立了“全国反对基地联络会议”，得到了日本工会总评议会、“日本文化界基地问题恳谈会”等群众团体的广泛支持，加强了斗争的力量。
    砂川的农民和支援他们的日本人民一步也不退让的反抗斗争，使得日本政府感到束手无策。于是日本政府决心想搬用“日美行政协定”中所规定的土地征用法，来强制占用农民的土地，因而指令砂川村村长把政府的决定向当地人民发布公告。但是砂川村村长宫崎传左卫门到了发布公告限期最后一天——7月27日宣布说：“我作为一个村长，站在尊重居民意志的立场上，即使把我钉在十字架上刺死，我也不发布征用土地的公告”。他就是这样断然拒绝了政府给他的指令。
    山口县的秋吉台是日本有名的名胜地。美军想用这个地方做他们的轰炸机演习场，引起了全县人民的反抗。日本学术会议公开表示这地方是学术上需要保存的地区，反对把它作为练习场。
    自从去年8月日本防卫厅宣布要把茨城县神之池作为反潜水艇侦察机基地以后，全县人民的反抗一直没有停止，阻止了这个计划的实现。今年8月20日，在三十四名县民代表主持下召开了盛大的反抗斗争大会，表示了继续战斗的决心。
    目前在日本全国任何地方不但不允许军事基地扩大一寸，并且就连小学生都发出了“撤销军事基地”、“美国佬滚回去”的呼声。今年七夕，按照惯例，孩子们都把他们的心愿写在彩色的纸条上，挂在竹子的枝头。而军事基地周围的孩子们写下的第一个心愿就是
  “美国佬滚回去”。
    八十万冲绳岛人民为了反对美国永久占有冲绳，一直在英勇地进行斗争。美国当局不顾一切，想用威胁手段吓倒他们。7月12日、13日、14日三天，美国用飞机在冲绳的伊江岛三十万坪（约一百万平方公尺）农田上喷洒汽油，烧光了防风林、白薯、甜菜和花生，并且以琉球大学学生呼喊“美国佬滚回去”为理由，宣布停止每年给与该大学的一百万美元的津贴。美军当局还宣布禁止美军在该岛中部买冲绳人的商品。但是，美军的威胁和镇压不但没有破坏冲绳岛人民的团结，相反的使得斗争的火焰愈加猛烈。美军当局为了禁止冲绳岛人民集会，发布军令说：“凡是要利用学校的场地举行集会，必须得到市教育委员会的许可。”然而由冲绳市民代表所组成的市教育委员会却不顾美军当局的命令，发出指令说：“在要求撤回（普赖斯建议）的斗争取得胜利以前，学校场地可供市民无限期使用。”冲绳岛人民的斗争组织——保卫冲绳土地协议会的团结一天比一天巩固。同美国打交道的五团体协议会（包括民政府、立法院、土地联合会、市町村长会和市町村议会议长会）越来越受到坚强的支持。设在东京的“解决冲绳问题国民运动联络会议”也日益壮大，参加的人越来越多。
    目前，日本人民已经从心眼里认清了是谁阻碍着他们建设独立、和平、民主的新日本，是谁在把勤劳的日本人民推入火坑！“美国佬滚回去！”的口号已成为广大日本人民的强烈呼声。（附图片）
