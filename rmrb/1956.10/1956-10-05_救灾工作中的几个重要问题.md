Several Important Issues in Disaster Relief Work
Zhou Fang

It's Important to Distinguish Between Priorities

After the August typhoon, the work group dispatched by the State Council went to various disaster-stricken provinces to investigate the disaster situation. When they arrived at the Caiyuan District of Dehui County, Jilin Province, they encountered a district-wide literacy campaign meeting being held. This district was one of the most severely affected areas in Dehui County, but it did not prioritize disaster relief work. Only after the work group suggested it, was it decided to temporarily suspend the literacy campaign. According to He Ke, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jilin Province, "This kind of situation also exists in other disaster-stricken counties." Why is this the case? Originally, the deployment of work in these areas mostly followed a top-down approach, and they rarely listened to the opinions and demands of the people in the disaster areas; they only sought to generally complete tasks, and rarely considered the special circumstances of the disaster areas.

Those who indiscriminately assign general work to disaster areas, regardless of priorities, should personally go to the disaster areas to see what difficulties the masses are facing, how they are living, what they are doing, thinking, and demanding. This way, they will know that things like improving oneself from illiteracy to being able to read and write are not the pressing demands of the disaster victims. What the disaster victims demand is to solve the problem of hunger first: in the immediate term, it is how to have shelter and food; in the long term, it is how to prevent the disaster from dragging on and how to defend against new disasters.

Work-for-Relief Has Many Benefits

The basic requirement of disaster victims is to rebuild through production. This includes three main aspects: first, agricultural production; second, sideline production; and third, engineering construction through work-for-relief. Regarding agricultural and sideline production, these are also important in non-disaster areas, but the characteristic of disaster areas is that agricultural production has been damaged or destroyed, so the focus is on restoring production, striving to maintain harvests, or striving for the harvest in the next season to make up for losses and shorten the disaster period. And sideline production is particularly important due to the poor agricultural harvest, so it is necessary to expand operations. These two aspects have already received relatively more attention in various places. However, the issue of work-for-relief needs to be specifically discussed.

Many work-for-relief methods combine disaster relief and disaster prevention. Many projects in the disaster areas have been washed away. Using work-for-relief to carry out these projects can not only enable the disaster victims to immediately benefit, but also allow these projects to be quickly repaired; especially water conservancy projects, which are more helpful in avoiding future disasters. Although there are many types of natural disasters, the most destructive is water damage. Farmers whose homes have been washed away by floods will find it difficult to recover in a short period of time, even with government relief. Rather than providing relief after a disaster, it is better to strengthen the construction of water conservancy projects for disaster prevention. In recent years, we have focused on major rivers, but have not paid enough attention to tributaries and small rivers; we have focused on dikes and reservoirs, but have neglected drainage ditches to prevent waterlogging. Now, many people in disaster areas have raised opinions to the government, demanding that waterlogging be eradicated and the management of tributaries and small rivers be strengthened. In the Huaiyin area of Jiangsu, the masses used to work every year to repair the Huai River, but the local waterlogging has not been cured. They demand that waterlogging be eradicated this year. Jiangsu Province sent a deputy governor to personally lead cadres from relevant departments to conduct on-site investigations in order to completely solve the disaster problems in this area; this is a very appropriate action. In Jilin Province, the river dikes have been well repaired in recent years, but there are not enough culverts, and the inland water discharge is not smooth, which has resulted in waterlogging. This year, the Fifth Society of Taiyangsheng in Dehui County had to dig open the river dike to discharge water because the low-lying areas were flooded; such lessons should be taken seriously. Therefore, in addition to repairing dikes this year as in previous years, we should focus on using work-for-relief methods to eradicate waterlogging.

After a disaster, what the disaster victims fear most is that there is no outlet for labor. As long as there is work to do and money to be earned, the disaster victims will feel at ease and feel that there is a way to survive the disaster. Therefore, in addition to agricultural and sideline production, work-for-relief is a good way to stabilize the hearts of the people in the disaster area and avoid blind flight from the famine. It is hoped that the local governments in the disaster areas will pay attention to this issue.

Distribution of Relief Funds Should Be Subject to Mass Discussion

This year's disaster relief work is very complex and arduous. To do this work well, we must adhere to the working method of combining leadership control with mass discussion. Some disaster areas have not distributed relief funds appropriately. The reason is that this method has not been well applied. In Xinglong and Xingfeng Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province, when distributing relief funds, several cooperative directors discussed it and determined 57 households. The district approved it and sent the director of the township credit cooperative to distribute the funds. As soon as he announced the list, he was opposed by the masses. After the township head knew about this, he went to the village to deal with it, but still did not go through mass discussion, but several cadres discussed it and reduced it to 13 households. Some farmers said: "This is exactly what we thought in our hearts." So, the funds were distributed and the meeting adjourned. Why did the decision made by the cadres coincide with what the masses thought in their hearts? It turned out that this was just a sarcastic remark expressing the masses' dissatisfaction. When the work group dispatched by the State Council to investigate the disaster arrived at this place, some people approached the comrades of the work group to express their opinions, explaining who should have received relief but did not. The work group personally visited and verified that a demobilized soldier was indeed living in very poor conditions, but received very little relief. In the Haiguang First Salt Industry Production Cooperative in Fengxian County, Jiangsu Province, the amount of relief funds was determined solely based on the extent of house destruction, resulting in the family members of a counter-revolutionary receiving the most funds because their original house was large and good, while some poor farmers received less funds because their original house was small and not good. This was also a mistake caused by not going through mass discussion.

Fully Utilize the Power of the Collective

This year, agricultural cooperativization has basically been realized in the disaster areas, and there are many conveniences for disaster relief work. Disaster situation verification can be carried out by the cooperative. The distribution of relief funds can be discussed by the cooperative, approved by the township, and then distributed by the township or the cooperative can distribute them for designated purposes. Most of the livestock are concentrated in the cooperative, and the grain and grass are also concentrated in the cooperative. There is no need for individual farmers to adjust the supply of fodder; if the cooperative's fodder is insufficient, it is easier to adjust it from outside the cooperative, and there is no need to purchase grass at a high price on the free market. If there is a shortage of fodder locally, and livestock must be moved to find grass, it is also easier to mobilize the livestock. The development of sideline occupations is mainly planned by the cooperative, and funds, tools, raw materials, etc. can be solved by using the collective strength of the cooperative and mobilizing mutual assistance among the members. The collective strength of cooperation has been demonstrated in prevention, rescue, and rehabilitation work, reducing the degree of disaster threat; it will inevitably be demonstrated in future disaster relief work.

Since cooperation has been realized, disaster relief work cannot be carried out without going through the cooperative. For example, repairing houses. In the past, individual farmers repaired their own houses, with relatives, friends, and neighbors helping with some work; now, if the cooperative does not make plans, it is difficult to repair them, because the labor force is uniformly allocated by the cooperative. Not to mention relatives, friends, and neighbors who want to help, even the individual has to participate in the cooperative's labor. However, as long as the leadership pays attention to it, makes labor plans, arranges the time well, and organizes the forces well, the houses will be repaired particularly quickly.

There are indeed many benefits to disaster relief through cooperatives, and there are indeed many new problems. Cooperatives have many people and a large scale. If mistakes occur in disaster relief work, the lives of many people will be affected. Therefore, although disaster relief work should be carried out through the cooperative, leadership cannot be abandoned. The leading organs should still specifically deploy the disaster relief work of each cooperative, and regularly check and supervise it. For example, in the first half of this year, the method of concentrating relief funds to agricultural cooperatives at one time was implemented. The advantage was that production and disaster relief activities could be carried out quickly; however, there were also shortcomings such as the cooperative diverting the funds for other purposes, so that the disaster victims did not receive relief. This is a great lesson. Disaster relief work must not be allowed to run its own course; the advantages of cooperatives should be utilized well, and the new problems that arise under cooperation must not be ignored.

    救灾工作中的几个重要问题
    周方
    办事要分清轻重缓急
    8月台风后，国务院派出的工作组到有灾各省查灾。走到吉林省德惠县菜园区，正遇上那里召开全区扫盲会议，开展扫盲运动。这个区是德惠县的最重灾区之一，却没有把救灾工作放到首要地位。经工作组提议，才决定暂时停止扫盲工作。据吉林省民政厅何克厅长谈：“这类情况，在其他受灾县也是有的。”为什么会如此呢？原来这些地区布置工作大都只是顺着由上往下一条道路，而很少注意听取灾区群众的意见和要求；只求一般地完成任务，而很少考虑灾区的特殊情况。
    把一般工作不分轻重缓急都向灾区布置的人，最好亲自到灾区跑跑，看看群众有什么困难，他们过着怎样的生活，他们在干什么，想什么，要求什么。这样，他们就会知道：把自己从文盲提高到能够读书识字之类的事，并不是灾民当前的迫切要求。灾民所要求的还是首先解决肚子问题：就当前说，就是如何能有住处、有饭吃；就长远说，就是如何能使灾荒不致拖长，并能够防御新的灾害。
            以工代赈好处多
    灾民的基本要求就是生产自救。这里面包括三个主要的内容，第一是农业生产，第二是副业生产，第三是以工代赈的工程建设。关于农业和副业生产，在非灾地区也是要重视的，灾区的特点在于农业生产遭到破坏或摧毁，因而其着眼点就在恢复生产，争取保收，或者争取未来一季的收成，以弥补损失，缩短灾期。而副业生产，正因农业的歉收，显得格外重要，要扩大经营。这两方面，各地都已经比较注意了。而以工代赈的问题，还需要特别提出来谈一谈。
    以工代赈的办法，很多是救灾和防灾相结合的办法。灾区已经有许多工程被冲毁，用以工代赈的办法来进行这些工程建设，不但可以使灾民马上得到收益，而且可以使这些工程迅速修复；特别是水利工程，更有助于避免今后的灾害。自然灾害种类虽多，而破坏力最大的莫过于水灾。被水灾冲光了家当的农民，即使政府救济，也很难在短时期内恢复元气。与其灾后救济，就不如加强防灾的水利工程建设。几年来，我们着重了大江大河，而对支流小河重视不够；着重了堤坝水库，而对防止内涝的排水沟渠有所忽视。现在，许多灾区群众对政府提出了意见，他们要求根治内涝，要求加强支流小河的治理。江苏淮阴专区的群众，过去每年都出工修治淮河，但本地的内涝却没有治好，他们要求今年根治内涝。江苏省派了一位副省长率领有关部门的干部去亲自考察，以求彻底解决这个地区的灾害问题；这样作是很恰当的。吉林省几年来江堤修得很好，但涵洞不够，内地泄水不畅，反而形成内涝。今年德惠县太阳升第五社因洼地被淹，不得已挖开江堤放水；这样的教训是应当重视的。因此，今年除同往年一样要修复堤坝外，应当着重用以工代赈的办法来根治内涝。
    在遭灾以后，灾民最害怕的，就是劳动力没有出路。只要有工可做，有钱可得，灾民的心就塌实了，感到度荒有办法了。因此，除了农业副业生产以外，以工代赈是安定灾区人心避免灾民盲目逃荒的一个好办法。希望灾区地方政府能够注意到这个问题。
      发放救济款要经过群众评议
    今年灾区的救济工作是很复杂很繁重的。要想做好这个工作，必须坚持领导掌握同群众评议相结合的工作方法。有些灾区救济款发放的不够恰当，究其原因，总是没有很好地运用这个方法。江苏省吴江县兴龙、兴凤两个农业生产合作社，在发放救济款的时候，几个社长议论一番，就确定了五十七户，区里就批准了，派乡信用社主任去发款。他一宣布名单，就遭到了群众的反对。乡长知道这事以后就到该村处理，但仍然没有经过群众评议，还是几个干部议论一番，就减少为十三户。有些农民说：“这下就和我们心中想的一样。”于是，发款散会。为什么干部决定的就恰巧和群众心中想的一样呢？原来这不过是群众心中不满意的一句反话。国务院派出的工作组查灾查到这个地方，就有人找工作组同志反映意见，说明有那些人该救济的没有得到救济。工作组亲自访查，确实看见有一位复员军人生活条件很不好，而所得救济却很少。江苏省奉贤县的海光第一盐业生产合作社，只凭房子被摧毁的情况来决定救济款发放的多少，以致有一个反革命分子家属因为原来房子大房子好而得款最多，而一些贫苦农民则因为原来房子小房子不好而得款少。这也是没有经过群众评议而造成的错误。
          充分发挥集体的力量
    今年灾区已经基本上实现农业合作化，救灾工作有许多方便之处。灾情核实可以以社为单位来进行。救济款的发放可以由社评议经乡批准后由乡发或指定用途由社代发。牲畜大多集中在社，谷草也集中在社，饲草供应无需各农户进行调剂；如果本社饲草不够，由外社调剂也比较容易，不必到自由市场去高价购草。如果本地饲草缺乏，必须移畜就草，牲畜也比较容易调动。副业的开展主要也是以社为单位去规划，资金、工具、原料等都可以运用社的集体力量和发动社员互助来解决。合作化的集体力量，已经在预防抢救和善后工作中，显示了出来，减少了灾害威胁的程度；在今后的救灾工作中，它也必然会显示出来。
    既已实现合作化，救灾工作不通过合作社，也是行不通的了。例如：修房子。过去是个体农民自己修，亲戚、朋友、邻居帮一些工；现在，合作社不作规划，就很难修理，因为劳动力都由社统一调配，不要说亲戚、朋友、邻居想帮工也没有时间，连自己也要去参加社的劳动。可是只要领导方面注意到了，做了劳动规划，把时间安排好，把力量组织好，则房屋修复的也特别快。
    通过合作社救灾，好处的确很多，新问题也的确不少。合作社人多摊子大，如果在救灾工作中发生差错，就要影响许多人的生活。所以，救灾工作固然要通过社去作，但也不能放弃领导。领导机关仍然应当对各社的救灾工作具体布置，并经常检查督促。例如，今年上半年曾经实行过将救济款一次集中交给农业社的办法，好处是可以迅速把生产救灾活动开展起来；但也曾发生了社把款子挪作别用，以致灾民得不到救济的缺点。这是一个很大的教训。救灾工作决不可放任自流；对于合作社的优越性应当善于运用，对于在合作化的情况下出现的新问题，也千万不可忽视。
