Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 6th. Soviet Academy of Sciences Corresponding Academician Ghelousov published an article in "Pravda" on the 5th, pointing out that the United States plans to launch an artificial satellite during the International Geophysical Year of 1957-1958; during this period, the Soviet Union will also conduct preparations for launching an artificial satellite.

According to materials provided by the United States, the artificial satellite launched by the United States will be about the size of a normal football and weigh less than ten kilograms. This artificial satellite will rotate along an elliptical orbit, sometimes 200 miles from the Earth and sometimes 700 miles away. It will fly at a speed of 18,000 miles per hour and will take one and a half hours to orbit the Earth once. It can exist for a few days to a month before the satellite burns up in the Earth's atmosphere.

Ghelousov said that the International Geophysical Conference held in Barcelona not long ago determined to use various tools, including electronic telescopes and nautical telescopes, to observe the operation of artificial satellites. In addition, instruments will also be installed on artificial satellites to automatically record temperature, air pressure, and the composition of the atmosphere, cosmic rays, meteorites, and other materials, and transmit these materials to the Earth via radio.

Ghelousov pointed out that the extensive use of rocket technology to launch artificial satellites is only one of the research and observation methods prepared for adoption during the International Geophysical Year. In addition, participating countries will also adopt methods such as aircraft observation, radio detectors and radar, as well as automation and remote control.

He said that Soviet scientists have been vigorously preparing for the International Geophysical Year since 1955. About 320 stations will be organized on Soviet territory to conduct various geophysical observations. The Soviet Union's drifting stations in the Arctic and observation stations in the Antarctic will also participate in this work. Local permanent meteorological observation stations will help this work. Currently, Soviet scientists are organizing about twenty-five observation teams, including two flight observation teams and six nautical observation teams.

    介绍苏美两国将来发射人造卫星的情况
    新华社莫斯科6日电　苏联科学院通讯院士杰洛乌索夫5日在“真理报”发表的一篇文章指出，美国计划在1957—1958年国际地球物理学年中就发射一个人造卫星；在这期间，苏联也将进行发射人造卫星的准备工作。
    根据美国提供的材料，美国发射的人造卫星大约将有通常一个足球那么大，重量不到十公斤。这个人造卫星将沿着一个椭圆形的轨道旋转，有时距离地球二百英里，有时离七百英里。它飞行的速度每小时可以达一万八千英里，绕地球一周将需要一个半钟头。在卫星在地球的大气中燃烧以前，它可以存在几天到一个月。
    杰洛乌索夫说，不久以前在巴塞隆那举行的国际地球物理会议曾经确定利用各种工具，包括电子望远镜和航海用的望远镜观察人造卫星的运转。此外，在人造卫星上还将安装仪器，以便自动记录温度、气压以及大气、宇宙线、陨石的构成和其他材料，并且把这些材料通过无线电传到地球上。
    杰洛乌索夫指出，广泛运用火箭技术发射人造卫星，这只是国际地球物理学年中准备采用的研究和观测方法中之一种。此外，各参加国还将采用飞机观测、无线电探测器和雷达以及自动化和远距离操纵等方法。
    他说，苏联科学家从1955年起就已经开始大力进行国际地球物理学年的准备工作。在苏联领土上将组织约三百二十个站，进行地球物理学的各种观察。苏联在北极的飘流站和南极的观察站也将参加这一工作。各地常设的气象观察站将帮助这一工作。现在，苏联科学家正在组织约二十五个观察队，其中包括两个飞行观察队和六个航海观察队。
