Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 14th. "The India Times" published an editorial yesterday saying that the recent riots in Hong Kong raised a pertinent question for the colonial government. The newspaper asked, "Can it not devise more effective measures to stop the infiltration of Kuomintang secret agents who are single-mindedly intent on disturbing the peace of the island?"

The newspaper continued, "It must not be forgotten that one of these secret agents was responsible for sabotaging the Air India International aircraft."

The newspaper added, "The Hong Kong government has no obligation to refuse to hand over the criminals responsible for this atrocity to the regime."

Xinhua News Agency, 14th. Tokyo dispatch: Some Japanese reporters in Hong Kong said that the Kowloon riots were planned by "Kuomintang secret agents." According to the Hong Kong correspondent of the Japanese "Sankei Jiji" in his report yesterday, the Kowloon riots "were undoubtedly instigated by Kuomintang secret agents."

A Kyodo News reporter reporting on the Kowloon riots said: "This disturbance, which was clearly planned by Kuomintang secret agents, will ultimately only be detrimental to the Kuomintang."

    “印度时报”社论和在香港的日本记者说
    骚乱是国民党特务制造的
    新华社新德里14日电　“印度时报”昨天发表社论说，最近香港的骚乱向这个殖民地政府提出了一个恰当的问题。这家报纸问道：“难道说它不能想出比较有效的措施来制止一心一意打算扰乱这个岛屿的和平的国民党特务的渗入吗？
    这家报纸继续说：“不能忘记，就是这些特务中的一个要对破坏印度国际航空公司飞机负责。”
    报纸又说：“香港政府对拒绝交出对这一暴行负责的罪犯的政权是没有什么义务的。”
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：在香港的一些日本记者说，九龙地区的骚乱是“国民党特务”策划的。据日本“产经时事报”驻香港记者昨天在他的报道中说，这次九龙骚乱事件“无疑是受国民党特务挑唆而起的”。他说，这场骚乱是预先“仔细计划和周密组织的”。
    日本共同社记者报道九龙骚乱情况时说：“这种显然是由国民党特务策划的骚动最后只会对国民党人不利”。
