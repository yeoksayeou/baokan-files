    My Views on the System of Awarding Advanced Collectives
    Ruan Ming
    The article "Critique of the 'Advanced Collective' System in Universities" by Comrade Zhang Ming, published in the People's Daily on July 3rd, raised objections to the "Advanced Collective" system. This is helpful in prompting Tsinghua University to examine the shortcomings in its work of evaluating and awarding "Advanced Collectives."
    Today, universities are experiencing the phenomenon of students having excessive academic burdens, which hinders their all-round development, their ability to work independently, and the development of their special talents. In some students, excessive extracurricular activities have affected their regular studies. In ideological education and cultural and sports activities, there have been tendencies towards excessive uniformity and over-collectivization. Comrade Zhang Ming asserts that the reason for these consequences is that university leaders "one-sidedly understand the policy of all-round development as average requirements and average development," and that the system of awarding advanced collectives is a "most concentrated organizational form" embodying this leadership thinking. Comrade Zhang Ming also pointed out phenomena such as students overemphasizing "collective mutual assistance" in their studies, which creates "undue pressure" on students who are struggling, and using "external force to help with cramming" during exams to improve "exam scores." Comrade Zhang Ming believes that these are all "inevitable manifestations of the learning competition nature inherent in the 'Advanced Collective awarding system'."
    Of course, if advanced collectives are not managed well, deviations can occur, but is the reality really as Comrade Zhang Ming asserts? This can be judged from the following aspects. First, among the nearly two hundred universities in the country, forty or so have implemented the "Advanced Collective" system. Then, in the remaining three-quarters or so of schools that have not implemented this system, do phenomena such as average requirements for students, excessive uniformity, and collective mutual assistance and excessive tension in studies not occur? Are there fundamental differences in degree or nature compared to what happens in the other quarter of schools? At the beginning of this year, when students in Beijing universities imitated the National Agricultural Development Program to create class plans, some schools experienced serious phenomena of forced uniformity, such as setting grade targets and requiring the entire class to eliminate "five-line staff blindness," etc. Some of these schools have never implemented the advanced collective system. Second, the advanced collective system was formally established at Tsinghua University in early 1954, and later in other schools. Have the above-mentioned problems become more serious than before early 1954? At least in the case of Tsinghua University, this is not the case. Third, apart from rest, students spend 90% of their time on classes, experiments, and teacher-assigned homework stipulated by the teaching plan, and the time for other extracurricular activities is often less than 10%. Then, if phenomena such as "forced uniformity, average requirements" and "restriction of students' special talents and reasonable development of interests and hobbies" arise, is the main problem really in this less than 10% portion?
    If the above three questions cannot be answered affirmatively, then the conclusion that adding "a certain inevitable nature of learning competition" to advanced collectives makes it the "most concentrated organizational form" that causes consequences such as "average development" is an oversimplification of complex causes.
    Comrade Zhang Ming lists some prominent shortcomings from different universities across the country that implement this system, which creates the false impression that all these problems occur simultaneously in every such university. I think this method of analysis is incomplete. Below, I provide some actual information about the evaluation and awarding of advanced collectives at Tsinghua University and offer some of my views.
  How did Tsinghua University's "Advanced Collective" system come about?
    After several social reform movements, especially the "Three-Anti" movement, there were still many crude and simplistic phenomena in the ideological education work of the Youth League. After Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the "Three Goods" call to the youth, ideological education began to pay attention to combining it with the characteristics of the youth. At the same time, one year after the teaching reform, the teaching work gradually got on track. At this time, some new atmospheres appeared among the students. For example, in Class 42 of the Surveying Specialty of Tsinghua University, the vast majority of students established a style of independent research in their studies. In their production internships, they undertook some of the surveying tasks of the First Tractor Factory. Because they loved their profession and had a high degree of work consciousness, they overfulfilled their tasks by three times, and were praised by the leaders on the construction site. The Youth League work in the class paid attention to combining the youth's characteristics to carry out the work, carried out ideological education in a lively manner, advocated that students establish close friendships and rationally develop each person's personality and specialties. Many students reflected that in such a collective, it was "easier and more pleasant to overcome one's shortcomings." They themselves called this class an advanced collective. At this time, the school accepted Mrs. Fucik's entrustment to send several portraits of Fucik to outstanding students, and in early 1954, they were used as awards for this class, and their experience in conducting ideological education work in combination with the characteristics of the youth was promoted. The deeds of Class 42 of the Surveying Specialty aroused widespread interest among the students of the whole school, who expressed their desire to learn from their example. Therefore, several months later, the school announced the trial implementation of the system for evaluating and awarding advanced collectives. Therefore, the emergence of "advanced collectives" precisely reflected the progress of teaching work, ideological education work, and the students themselves, and it was not subjectively imposed on the students by issuing regulations and calling for mobilization.
    Does the "Advanced Collective" limit the special talents and hobbies of students?
    I would like to give an example of the actual situation of a class first, to show that an equal sign cannot be drawn between advanced collectives and the restriction of students’ personalities and hobbies, and there is no "inevitable" connection: the students of the Advanced Collective Casting Specialty Cast Five Whole Class established a style of loving their profession, caring about politics, and daring to carry out criticism and self-criticism. On the other hand, the class also cares about the development of each student's personality and specialties. Some of them focus on studying the problems of casting alloys, and some of them focus on studying the problems of casting equipment. Many students also study astronomy, philosophy, literature, etc. outside of class according to their hobbies. Daily life is arranged by the students themselves. They feel that in the advanced collective, they can cultivate the commonalities that a college student should have, and at the same time, it does not prevent each person from developing their talents and hobbies.
    Of course, it should be explained that the phenomena of average development and forced uniformity are not fundamentally non-existent at Tsinghua University. On the contrary, they have occurred and still exist to some extent today, but the reason is not as simple as Comrade Zhang Ming said.
    Tsinghua University began to promote the Labor and Defense System in physical exercise in 1952, which played a great role in the health of students. Because the standards of the Labor and Defense System were relatively low at that time, there were many projects to choose freely, and it was stipulated that a physical examination must be passed before participating in formal exercise, so there was generally no obvious deviation of excessive demands. The main problem was with the joint instructions of the Ministry of Higher Education, the Sports Commission, the Ministry of Health, and the Central Committee of the Youth League in 1956. This instruction mechanically used the Soviet Union's 1955 Labor and Defense System standards, which stipulated too many projects and too little room for choice. For example, it stipulated that one of "ten-kilometer march" and "bicycle" must be selected, so that people who did not have the conditions to ride a bicycle had to march under the scorching sun with heavy sandbags on their backs. The joint instruction required all universities across the country to implement it uniformly. This inevitably led to some deviations of excessive demands in all universities across the country.
    The phenomenon of forced uniformity in extracurricular activities such as cultural entertainment did not develop along with the advanced collective system. But this phenomenon did exist, especially starting in March of this year, when the Youth League organization arranged for students to make plans, and the method of making production plans was moved to the school. Students once had a more serious tendency, and some classes, in addition to setting grade targets, also required everyone to be able to dance youth dances, and set a time limit to eliminate "five-line staff blindness," etc. After the school leaders discovered this problem in April of this year, they resolutely corrected it and stipulated the principle of free participation in extracurricular activities (including listening to political reports, etc.). The situation has changed greatly now.
    The most important factor affecting the rational development of students' personal talents and interests, I think, should be found in the teaching work that has the greatest impact on students. Because the teaching plan gives students almost no flexibility, most students live a life of "only having Saturday and no Sunday," and there is no proper possibility to study their favorite subjects outside of the prescribed homework. How can we talk about students' special talents and interests?
    The conclusion that the advanced collective system is the "the most concentrated organizational form" of a one-sided understanding of all-round development as average development is obviously exaggerated. From the implementation of the advanced collective system itself, what is worth noting for improvement is the political and ideological work of the Youth League. In the past year, because it failed to overcome some of the crude practices after the political movement and timely guide the enthusiasm of the Youth League activists in the socialist upsurge, many simplifications appeared in the Youth League work of some classes. As a result, it contributed to the occurrence of the above-mentioned shortcomings in the process of promoting the whole class to strive for advanced collectives. However, as long as the reasons are correctly found, they can be completely overcome, and they are already in the process of being overcome. Is the "Advanced Collective" bound to cause excessive tension in students' studies?
    The stipulation in the Tsinghua University Advanced Collective System Trial Implementation Method that "the overall score should be higher than that of all classes in the school" is inappropriate. In the past, it was not mechanically implemented during the evaluation. For example, Class 81 of the Mechanical Engineering Department was rewarded with the "Advanced Collective" because of its good study style and ability to work hard and make progress quickly, even though its overall score was not very good. Of course, the above-mentioned stipulation easily makes the "class cadres" pay too much attention to the average score of the whole class, forming pressure on some students. This is indeed a shortcoming, and the regulations were initially revised in the first half of this year. There are many reasons for the phenomenon of excessive tension in studies: such as too heavy a burden in class, and not consolidating knowledge at ordinary times, so students are more nervous during exams. In addition, students in lower grades are not accustomed to the oral exam system, and the examination regulations (such as failing one subject leads to repeating the class, etc.) that were uniformly promulgated in the past are also reasons for students' tension. However, many advanced collectives at Tsinghua University often enlightened or encouraged students who did not do well in the exams in order to help these students ideologically, which played a good role in improving their confidence and avoiding excessive tension.
    Regarding mutual assistance in learning, Comrade Zhang Ming said that there is no longer "a set of practices such as learning mutual assistance groups that have been criticized," but he cited some practices that he considered excessive. Whether these practices are all "excessive" or inappropriate needs to be analyzed. For example, what is wrong with "exchanging notes with each other after class"? Since the teaching reform, the school has emphasized the cultivation of students' independent working ability. There are also individual awards for learning achievements, scientific research and production internships in the reward system. At the same time, many classes have teachers as counselors to guide the organization of learning work in the class, and students generally value the help of teachers, so the obvious deviation of overemphasizing collective mutual assistance and neglecting the role of teachers basically does not exist. Of course, the cultivation of students' independent working ability is very insufficient. The reason is that the learning burden is too heavy, some teachers' guidance is not effective, and the teaching system itself needs to be improved.
    The relationship between the advanced collective system and learning competition should also be specifically analyzed: What is learning competition, and why should it be opposed? Now middle schools have math competitions, and those with good grades can be admitted to math and mechanics majors without exams. Should this kind of competition also be opposed? Also, the examination system itself evaluates the pros and cons of achievements and urges those who do not study well to work hard and make progress. Are these also competitions that should be opposed? It can be seen that the concept of learning competition should be clarified. The phenomenon of comprehensively setting targets and pursuing average score targets should be resolutely prevented. From the perspective of Tsinghua University, the main role of advanced collectives in learning is to enable students to love their profession and science and form a good learning style through mutual ideological concern, and to exchange some good learning experiences and exchange learning insights with each other under the guidance of teachers. Commending such collectives does not lead to adverse effects.
     The advanced collective system should not be completely negated
    The advanced collective system is a way of working, and its reward content can be modified according to the principle of "all-round development, teaching students according to their aptitude," inappropriate regulations can be changed or cancelled, and the evaluation procedures can also be changed. The question is whether class collectives of university students can be rewarded. If the student class collective is to continue to exist, the quality of the collective will also affect the growth of each student. Excellent individuals can be rewarded, so why can't excellent collectives be rewarded?
    It is certainly wrong to absolutize the advanced collective system and unconditionally promote this system in all schools, regardless of the situation; similarly, it is unfair to indiscriminately obliterate the positive role that the evaluation of advanced collectives has indeed produced in some schools, and to label it with the big hat of "fundamentally violating the principles of education." Student work at Tsinghua University has many shortcomings, and the work of rewarding advanced collectives naturally has shortcomings. The main problem is that the role of the advanced collective system is overestimated, and some classes regard striving to become an advanced collective not as a result of regular work, but as a goal of work, which makes class cadres and students too nervous. There is also a tendency to pursue scores and targets in the evaluation. However, when criticizing shortcomings, we should also pay attention not to "pour out the dirty water and the child from the bathtub together."

    我对评奖先进集体制度的看法
    阮铭
    7月3日人民日报发表张明同志“评高等学校的‘先进集体’制度”一文对“先进集体”制度提出了反对的意见，这对推动清华大学去检查评奖“先进集体”工作中的缺点是有帮助的。
    今天高等学校有着学生学习负担过重的现象，既妨碍了学生的全面发展，也妨碍了学生独立工作能力的提高和学生的特长的发展。在部分学生中，因为课外活动过多，影响了正课的学习。在思想教育工作和文娱体育活动中曾经发生过强求一律、过分集体化等偏向。产生这些后果的原因，张明同志断言是由于高等学校领导方面“把全面发展的方针片面地了解为平均要求和平均发展”，而奖励先进集体制度是体现这种领导思想的一个“最集中的组织形式”。张明同志又指出了学生学习中过分强调“集体互助”，对学习差的学生造成“不应该有的压力”，和在考试时用“外力突击帮助”的办法以提高“考试成绩”等现象。张明同志认为这都是“评奖先进集体制度”本身带有学习竞赛性质的一种必然性的表现”。
    先进集体搞得不好当然是会出偏差的，但是事实究竟是不是如张明同志所断言的那样呢？可以从下列几方面加以判断。第一，全国近二百所高等学校有四十多所学校推行了“先进集体”制度，那么，在没有推行这一制度的其余的四分之三左右的学校中是否就没有对学生平均要求、过分强求一律和学习上集体互助、过度紧张等等现象发生呢？是否同其他四分之一的学校中所发生的在程度上或在性质上有原则的区别呢？今年年初北京市高等学校学生中模仿农业发展纲要订班的规划的时候，有的学校中就一度出现严重的强求一律的现象，如订分数的规划，要求全班消灭“五线谱盲”等等，这些学校中有的从来就没有推行先进集体制度。第二，先进集体制度在清华大学是1954年初正式建立的，其他学校应当更晚一些，上述的这些问题是不是比1954年初以前更加严重了呢？至少在清华大学的情况不是这样的。第三，学生一天的时间除了休息以外，90％的时间是用在教学计划所规定的上课、实验和教师指定的课外作业上，其他的课外活动时间还往往不到10％，那么产生“强求一律，平均要求”、“限制了学生特长和兴趣爱好的合理发展”的现象，难道问题主要就出在这10％不到的部分吗？
    如果上述三个问题不能得到肯定的答复，把先进集体加上“带有学习竞赛性质的一种必然性”，是造成“平均发展”等后果的一个“最集中的组织形式”等结论，就未免把复杂的原因简单化了。
    张明同志把全国推行这个制度的不同的高等学校中的一些突出的缺点集中起来加以列举，这样就会给人一种错觉，好像每一个这类高等学校中都同时发生了这些问题，我觉得这样的分析方法是不全面的。下面我提供一些清华大学评奖先进集体的实际情况，并提出一些我的看法。
  清华大学的先进集体制度是怎么搞起来的？
    在几次社会改革运动特别是“三反”运动以后，青年团的思想教育工作中还存在不少粗暴和简单化的现象，在毛泽东同志对青年提出了“三好”号召以后，思想教育开始注意结合青年特点来进行，同时在教学改革进行一年以后，教学工作也逐步走上轨道。这时学生中就出现了一些新的气象，例如清华大学测量专修科四二班，绝大多数学生学习上树立了独立钻研的风气。在生产实习中他们担负了第一拖拉机厂的部分测量任务。由于他们热爱自己的专业，工作自觉性高，因而超额三倍完成了任务，受到工地领导上的表扬。班上青年团的工作注意结合了青年特点进行工作，用生动活泼的方式进行思想教育，提倡学生之间建立亲密的友谊和合理发展每个人的个性特长。许多学生反映在这样的集体中“克服自己的缺点，更加愉快与容易”。他们自己称这个班为一个先进的集体。正在这个时候，学校接受了伏契克夫人把几张伏契克的画像送给优秀的学生的委托，就在1954年初把它们作为对这个班的奖励，并且推广了他们结合青年特点进行思想教育工作的经验。测量专修科四二班的事迹引起全校学生的广泛兴趣，纷纷表示要学习他们的榜样。因此在几个月以后学校公布了评奖先进集体的制度的试行办法。所以“先进集体”的出现正是反映了教学工作、思想教育工作和学生本身的进步，并不是用颁布条例、号召动员等方法主观地强加在学生身上去的。
    “先进集体”是否限制学生的特长和爱好？
    我想先举出一个班的实际情况作为例子，说明先进集体和限制学生个性和爱好的中间并不能划一个等号，也不存在什么“必然的”联系：铸造专业先进集体铸五全班学生，树立了热爱专业，关心政治，勇于开展批评和自我批评的风气。另一方面，班上同样关心每个学生个性特长的发展，他们有的偏重研究铸造合金方面的问题，有的偏重研究铸工设备问题。不少学生根据自己的爱好还在课外学习天文、哲学、文艺等。日常生活是由学生们自己安排的。他们感到在先进集体里，可以培养一个大学生应该具备的共性，同时也不妨碍每个人发展自己的才能和爱好。
    当然，应该说明，平均发展、强求一律的现象在清华大学并不是根本不存在的，相反，它们曾经发生过，并且今天也还在某种程度上存在着，只不过原因不像张明同志所说那样简单罢了。
    清华大学在1952年开始在体育锻炼中推行劳卫制，对学生身体的健康起了很大的作用。由于当时劳卫制标准比较低，可以自由选择的项目也多，并且规定要通过体格检查才能参加正规锻炼，所以一般还没有明显的要求过高过急的偏差。问题主要出在1956年高等教育部、体育运动委员会、卫生部和青年团中央的联合指示上。这个指示机械搬用苏联的1955年劳卫制标准，规定的项目太多，选择余地太少。例如规定“十公里行军”和“自行车”中必选一项，使没有条件骑车的人只得在烈日下背着沉重的沙袋去行军。联合指示全国高等学校必须一律执行。这就使全国所有的高等学校都不免产生了某些要求过高过急的偏差。
    在文化娱乐等课外活动上强求一律的现象，也并不是跟着先进集体制度一起发展起来的。但这种现象确实是有过的，特别在今年3月开始，青年团组织布置学生订规划，把订生产规划的办法搬到学校中来，学生中一度就发生了比较严重的偏向，有的班除了订分数指标以外还要求人人会跳青年舞，限期扫除“五线谱盲”等等。这个问题在今年4月间经学校领导发现以后，坚决地纠正了，并且规定课外活动（包括听政治报告等）自由参加的原则。现在情况已经有很大的改变。
    影响学生个人特长和兴趣的合理发展的最重要的因素，我认为应该到对学生影响最大的教学工作中去找。由于教学计划几乎没有给学生以任何灵活性，大多数学生过着“只有星期七没有星期日”的生活，在规定的作业以外就再没有适当的可能去钻研自己爱好的课目。这怎么还谈得到有学生的特长和兴趣呢？
    把先进集体制度视为片面了解全面发展为平均发展的“最集中的组织形式”的结论，显然是夸大了。从推行先进集体制度本身来说，值得注意改进的是青年团的政治思想工作，在最近一年以来，由于没有及早克服政治运动以后的某些粗糙作法和及时引导青年团的积极分子在社会主义高潮中的热情，在一些班级的青年团的工作中出现了不少简单化的现象，因而在推动全班争取先进集体的过程中助长了上述缺点的发生，但只要正确地找出了原因，是完全可以克服的，并且也已在克服的过程中。“先进集体”是否必然引起学生的学习过分紧张？
    清华大学先进集体制度试行办法中规定有“总成绩为全校各班中较高者”这一条件是不恰当的。过去在评奖的时候实际上也没有机械执行。例如机械系制八十一班由于学习风气好，能够努力钻研，学习进步比较快，虽然总成绩并不很好，也给予“先进集体”的奖励。当然，上述这个规定容易使“班干部”过分注意全班的平均分数，形成对部分学生的压力，这的确是一个缺点，已经在今年上半年把条例作了初步修改。学习上过分紧张的现象，原因是很多的：如课内负担太重，平时掌握知识不巩固，因而考试的时候就比较紧张；此外如低年级学生不习惯口试制度，以及过去统一颁布的考试考查规程（如不论什么课，一门不及格就降班等等），也都是学生紧张的原因。但是清华大学有许多先进集体为了从思想上帮助考得不好的同学，还常常对这些同学进行开导或者鼓励，这对提高他们的信心和避免过度紧张起了一些好的作用。
    关于学习互助，张明同志说现在已经没有“学习互助组等一套受过批判的作法”，但是又举出一些他认为是过分的作法。这些作法是否都是“过分”或者不恰当，也是需要分析的。例如“下课 时互相对笔记”，有什么坏处呢？教学改革以来，学校是比较强调提倡学生的独立工作能力的，在奖励制度中也有对学习成绩、科学研究和生产实习的个人奖励。同时许多班有教师作班主任，专门指导班上组织学习的工作，学生也一般重视教师的帮助，所以明显的过分注重集体互助和忽视教师作用的偏向基本上是不存在的。当然对学生独立工作能力的养培是很不够的，原因在于学习负担过重，有的教师指导不得法，教学制度本身还有待改进。
    关于先进集体制度同学习竞赛的关系，也要加以具体分析：什么叫作学习竞赛，为什么要反对？现在中学有数学比赛，成绩好的可以免试入数学力学专业，这种竞赛是否也要反对呢？又如，考试制度本身要评判成绩优劣，督促学习不好的努力上进，是不是也都是竞赛，而要反对？可见学习竞赛的概念应该加以澄清。全面订指标，追求平均分数指标的现象是应该坚决防止的。从清华大学的情况看，先进集体在学习上的主要作用是通过互相在思想上的关心，使学生热爱专业，热爱科学，形成良好的学习风气，并且在教师指导下互相交流一些好的学习的经验，交换学习心得。表扬这样的集体并不致于发生不良的效果。
     对先进集体制度不应该全盘否定
    先进集体制度是一种工作方式，它的奖励内容可以根据“全面发展，因才施教”的方针修改，不恰当的条例可以改变或取消，评奖的手续也可以变通。问题在于是不是可以对大学生的班集体进行奖励。如果学生的班集体要存在下去，集体的好坏也将影响每个学生的成长。对优秀的个人可以奖励，为什么不可以对优秀的集体奖励呢？
    不问情况，把先进集体制度绝对化，把这个制度无条件地推行于一切学校，当然是不对的；同样，不分青红皂白，把评奖先进集体曾经在某些学校中确实产生了的积极作用一笔抹煞，并且扣上“根本违反教育原理”的大帽子，这也是不公平的。清华大学学生工作是有不少缺点的，奖励先进集体的工作本身自然也有缺点，主要是对先进集体制度的作用估计过高，有些班级把争取成为先进集体不是看作经常工作的结果，而当作工作的目标，使班干部和学生过分紧张；评奖中也有追求分数、指标的偏向。但是在批判缺点的时候，也应该注意不要“把污水和小孩子从浴盆里一起倾倒掉了”。
