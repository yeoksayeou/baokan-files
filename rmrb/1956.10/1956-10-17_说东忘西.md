    Saying East and Forgetting West
    He Li
    I was in Huzhuang, New Army Village Central Cooperative, Fengrun County, to understand the development of production after liberation. I talked to several cooperative members about the income of farmers. They excitedly told me that some farmers' net income this year was over 10,000 jin, exceeding that of rich peasants in the past. I was very happy to hear this, so I asked for details. They said: In the past, there was a rich peasant named Zhang Lujing in the village who had 120 mu of land, and each mu could only yield 180 jin per year, for a total of 21,600 jin. But a large part of these 20,000+ jin had to be deducted. His family hired two and a half long-term laborers, costing 12,500 jin a year. Raising three livestock required another 2,160 jin. Buying fine fertilizer required 1,600 jin of grain, seeds 600 jin, and taxes 6,000 jin. In total, these deductions amounted to 22,860 jin. I was shocked by this calculation. I said, "Doesn't this rich peasant lose 1,260 jin? Then where does his family get food?" A farmer immediately replied, "We also calculated the accounts in the past. Hiring people to farm is not profitable." He seemed to be testifying not only for Zhang Lujing but also for all rich peasants.
    If this calculation is correct, it certainly illustrates the superiority of today's advanced cooperative economic system on one hand, but on the other hand, it seems that the rich peasants here did not exploit anyone. Because everything produced by the hired laborers, besides the cost and the grain seized by the reactionary government, was all repaid to the hired laborers, and they even lost money. The hired laborers here did not offer any surplus labor to the rich peasants. Of course, the actual situation is not like this.
    Then, are these farmers' talks fabricated? No, they are not. These situations are generally true, but they are not accurate or comprehensive. Their excitement about this year's bumper harvest has diluted the true situation of the rich peasants' exploitation.
    It turns out that the so-called normal annual output in the past was not a fixed line. A mu yielding several hundred jin was not exactly several hundred jin. It had a flexible range, with its own upper and lower limits. In the past, in general normal years, the yield was about 200 jin per mu, and in good years, it could reach 280, 290 to 300 jin. Moreover, the agricultural income of rich peasants was not just grain. Besides grain, there were many sideline businesses. The people who spoke, in order to prove how good things are now, pushed the past production level of the rich peasants to the lowest limit, and only calculated their main income, not their sideline income. For example, Zhang Lujing's family also raised a dozen large fat pigs every year, which was not included in the calculation, thus distorting the overall true situation. Do you say they did it intentionally? Of course not. Do you say they did it unintentionally? It should be said that they were influenced by certain ideological viewpoints.
    Maybe everyone who reads this will find the farmers naive and ridiculous. Hold on! Please don't laugh! This kind of thinking is not limited to these farmers; it is common to many of us. Everything has two sides. In order to choose one side, we often lose sight of the other. We take care of the upper limit and ignore the lower limit. Relying only on temporary excitement and personal preferences, we expand one side and shrink the other, distorting the truth. Isn't the so-called "saying east and forgetting west" a phenomenon that only happens to individuals? This common problem must be solved with a scientific attitude.
    Of course, when a person is shooting, he cannot fire in all directions at the same time, but when anyone raises a gun, he always stretches his left foot forward and pushes his right foot back. The purpose of pushing the right foot back is not only to support the body's forward lean but also to prevent the recoil of the gun when firing. A person who is not good at shooting will stand with both feet together, without pushing his back foot. As soon as the bullet is fired, he will be knocked down by the recoil of the gun. Speaking is the same. The purpose must be clear. You cannot say east and west at the same time, but east and west exist simultaneously. When saying east, you must never forget west; otherwise, the loopholes in your words will release recoil and knock you flat on your back.

    说东忘西
    贺笠
    我在丰润县新军屯中心社的胡庄了解解放后生产发展的状况，和几个社员谈起农民的收入，他们兴奋地告诉我：今年有些农民的纯收入在一万斤以上，超过过去的富农。我听了很高兴，便问其详，他们说：庄上过去有家富农叫张屡靖的，有一百二十亩地，每年一亩只能收一百八十斤，总共收二万一千六百斤。但在这两万多斤中有很大一部分都要扣除。他家雇了两个半长工，一年就得一万二千五百斤。养有三头牲口，又得二千一百六十斤。买细肥要粮食一千六百斤，种籽六百斤，纳粮六千斤。以上共要扣除二万二千八百六十斤。我听了这个计算不禁愕然。我说：“这家富农不是要赔本一千二百六十斤吗？那末他家吃的是那里来的？”一个农民马上回答说：“我们过去也曾算过账，雇人做庄稼是不赚钱的。”他好像不仅为张屡靖作证，也为一切富农作证。
    假如这个计算是正确的，它在一端固然说明了今天高级社经济制度的优越，但是在另一端，又好像这里的富农并没有剥削。因为由雇工所生产出来的东西，除了成本和反动政奉权所夺取的粮食以外，全都偿还了雇工，而且还赔本，这里的雇工是没有剩余劳动敬奉给富农的。实际情况当然不是这样的。
    那末，这几个农民的谈话是不是捏造呢？也不是的。这些情况大体也都是真的，但是不准确，不全面，他们被今年丰收的快感冲淡了富农剥削的真实情况。
    原来所谓过去的常年产量，并不是死死的一条线，亩产几百斤就是几百斤，它有一个可以伸缩的范围，有着自己的上限和下限，这里过去一般正常年景，低的每亩收粮约二百斤左右，高的可达二百八、九至三百斤。而且富农的农业收入不只是粮食，除了粮食还有很多副业。说话的人为了证明现在的好，把过去富农的生产水平都压到最低限去，而且只计算他的主要收入，不计算他的副业收入，如张屡靖家每年还要养十来口大肥猪就没有算进去，结果就歪曲了全面真实的情况。你说他们是有意吗，当然不是；你说他们是无意吗，也应该说他们是有一定的思想观点支配的。
    也许大家看了觉得农民幼稚可笑，且住！请大家不要取笑！这种思想状况并不是这些农民的，而是我们很多人所共有的。一切事物都有两面，为了选择这一面，常常丢掉那一面。照顾了上限，忽略了下限。只凭一时兴奋，一己所好，扩大一方，缩小一方，歪曲了事实真相。所谓“说东忘西”岂是个别人的现象吗？这种通病必须以科学的态度来解决。
    固然，一个人在进行射击时，不能同时四面发射，但是任何人在举枪的时候，总是左脚伸前，右脚蹬后。右脚蹬后的目的，不仅为了支持身体前倾，同时也是为了预防发射时枪的后坐力，一个不善射击的人两足并立，不蹬后脚，弹一出口就会被枪的坐力打倒的，说话也是如此，必须目的明确，不能同时说东又说西，但东西却是同时存在的，说东时绝不能忘西，否则就会被话的漏洞放出后坐力来，打你一个仰翻叉。
