Continue Efforts to Master All Technologies
By People's Daily Commentator

    The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has been built and put into production in a short period of three years with the selfless assistance of the Soviet people, the efforts of all the plant's employees, and the support of the people of the whole country. When we think that in the near future, on the crisscrossing highways of the motherland, on the defense front lines, and next to the granaries of agricultural production cooperatives, more and more Chinese-made cars will be driving, we will naturally be overjoyed and express our heartfelt congratulations on this victory in the course of China's socialist industrialization!
    In the process of the construction and preparation for the start of production of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, all parties have accumulated some experience, laying a preliminary foundation for the further development of China's automobile industry. However, this is only the beginning of China's independent automobile manufacturing industry. There are still many things we need to do.
    For the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the automobile industry sector, the main task for the next period is to strive to master new technologies and greatly improve technical levels. This is because: First, the current production of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is not yet very stable, and technical errors and accidents are still found from time to time, and the ability to independently solve new technical problems is still insufficient. Therefore, all employees of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant need to study hard, learn the technology of operating all machinery and equipment, and improve management levels, so as to ensure the normal progress of production and strive to reach the designed capacity as soon as possible. Second, in order to better meet the needs of the country, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant must trial-produce a batch of modified vehicles on the basis of producing "Liberation" brand cars, such as three-axle off-road vehicles and automatic dump trucks. Some components of the "Liberation" brand cars also need to be appropriately improved according to China's natural conditions. Third, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is also responsible for sending talents to the future construction of larger-scale automobile manufacturing plants, which requires efforts to improve the technical level, so as to make itself a factory that can produce cars in large quantities and with good quality, and at the same time become a school for training construction talents for the automobile industry. Fourth, at present, although China's engineering and technical personnel have initially mastered the technology of building automobile manufacturing plants and producing cars, they have not yet mastered the design technology, and do not have the ability to design factories, products, and processes for the automobile industry. In order to establish China's independent automobile manufacturing industry and strive to catch up with the world's advanced level as soon as possible, we must strive to learn the complete set of technologies in the automobile industry.
    In order to ensure the continuous mass production of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and further develop the automobile manufacturing industry, the metallurgical and mechanical industries also need to strive to improve their technical levels and strive to produce more and better materials, cooperative products, and equipment needed by the automobile industry. The 409 kinds of cooperative products needed by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant have all been produced and supplied by domestic factories, which is something that could not have been imagined in old China. However, at present, the quality of some cooperative products is not high, and the quantity is also insufficient. The steel needed by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant still needs to be imported in large quantities. The machine tools of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant are also almost all supplied from abroad. Therefore, the metallurgical industry sector needs to quickly take effective measures to strengthen the trial production and production of new types of steel needed by the automobile industry; the mechanical and other industrial sectors need to vigorously improve the quality of cooperative products of the automobile factory and increase production to ensure the needs of mass production of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. In order to gradually achieve independent equipment of automobile manufacturing plants, the machinery industry sector also needs to actively develop the machine tool industry needed by the automobile industry. Only when all relevant industrial sectors have mastered the technology of producing various materials, equipment, and cooperative products needed by the automobile industry can China's automobile manufacturing industry develop by leaps and bounds.
    The start of production of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is the first victory of China's automobile manufacturing industry. As long as we prevent arrogance, study hard, and actively improve our technical level, we will achieve greater victories more quickly.

    继续努力，掌握全部技术

    第一汽车制造厂在苏联人民无私的援助，全体建厂职工的努力和全国人民的支援下，用短短三年的时间就建设起来，开工生产了。当我们想到在不久的将来，在祖国纵横的公路上，在国防前线，在农业生产合作社粮仓旁边，将要越来越多地行驶着中国自己制造的汽车的时候，自然要欢欣鼓舞，对我国社会主义工业化途程中取得的这一胜利表示由衷的祝贺！
    在第一汽车厂兴建和准备开工生产的过程中，各方面都积累了一些经验，为我国进一步发展汽车工业打下了初步的基础。但是，这还仅仅是我国独立的汽车制造工业的开端。我们需要做的事情还有很多。
    对第一汽车制造厂和汽车工业部门来说，今后一个时期主要的任务是努力掌握新技术，大力提高技术水平。这是因为：第一，第一汽车厂目前的生产还不十分稳定，生产技术方面的差错和事故还时有发现，独立解决新的技术问题的力量也还不足。因此，需要第一汽车厂全体职工努力学习，学会开动全部机器设备的技术，提高管理水平，这样才能保证生产的正常进行，并且争取尽快地达到设计能力。第二，为了更好地满足国家的需要，第一汽车厂要在生产“解放牌”汽车的基础上，试制一批变型汽车，如三轴越野车、自动卸货车等。“解放牌”汽车的部分构件，也需要根据我国自然条件作适当改进。第三，第一汽车厂还担负着为今后建设规模更大的汽车制造工厂输送人材的任务，这就需要努力提高技术水平，以便使自己成为能够又多又好地生产汽车的工厂，同时又成为培养汽车工业建设人材的学校。第四，目前，我国工程技术人员虽然已经初步掌握了建设汽车制造工厂和生产汽车的技术，但是还没有掌握设计技术，没有具备汽车工业的工厂设计、产品设计和工艺设计的能力。为了建立起我国的独立的汽车制造工业，争取尽快地赶上世界先进水平，我们必须努力学会汽车工业方面的全套技术。
    为了保证第一汽车厂不断地大量进行生产和进一步发展汽车制造工业，冶金和机械等工业部门也需要努力提高技术水平，争取更多更好地生产汽车工业需要的材料、协作产品和设备。现在第一汽车厂需要的四百零九种协作产品，已经全部由国内工厂生产和供应，这是一件在旧中国不能想像的事情。但是，目前有些协作产品质量不高，数量也不足。第一汽车厂现在需要的钢材，很多还需要进口。第一汽车厂的机床，也几乎都是国外供应的。因此，冶金工业部门需要迅速采取有效措施，加强汽车工业所需要的新品种钢材的试制和生产；机械等工业部门需要大力提高汽车厂协作产品的质量，增加产量，以保证第一汽车厂大批生产的需要。为了逐步作到独立装备汽车制造工厂，机械工业部门还需要积极发展汽车工业需要的机床工业。只有各个有关的工业部门都掌握了生产汽车工业需要的各种材料、设备和协作产品的技术，我国汽车制造工业才能够大踏步地发展。
    第一汽车制造厂开工生产，是我国汽车制造工业的第一个胜利。只要我们防止骄傲，努力学习，积极提高技术水平，我们就会更快地取得更大的胜利。
