How carefree is the bright moon, strolling in the pale blue sky, with clouds and a few stars accompanying her to admire the night view of the sea.
        The wind is calm, the waves are still, and the small boats shatter the moon's reflection. The sea holds its breath, listening to the melodious singing of the fisher girls.
        Thousands of lights twinkle in the green waves, brighter than pearls and more exquisite than crystals.
        Like the joyous fireworks in front of Tiananmen Square, like the rainbow of construction over the Yangtze River, like the bustling night market beside the Haizhu Bridge, the lights here also illuminate peaceful labor!
        Schools of fish jump and leap, the silver light dazzling the fishermen's eyes. The hold is about to be filled, so, head of the cooperative, which boat shall we put this net into?
        Happy laughter and joy move the sentimental moon greatly. Oh, moon! Please report to Beijing, there is a beautiful city on the distant sea!

    海上的城
    韩笑明月多么潇洒，漫步在淡青的天空，朵朵浮云，几颗星星，陪她欣赏海上的夜景。风平，浪静，小船儿摇碎了月影，大海屏着呼吸，听渔家女婉啭的歌声。千万盏明灯，在绿波中闪动，比珍珠还亮，比水晶还玲珑。像天安门前欢乐的花火，像扬子江上建设的彩虹，像海珠桥畔繁华的夜市，这儿的灯也照耀着和平的劳动！成群的鱼儿又跳又蹦，银光耀花了渔翁的眼睛，舱里眼看要装满了，社长啊，这一网放到那只船中？幸福的欢声笑语，让多情的明月十分激动，明月呀！请你报告北京，遥远的海上有美丽的城！
