    The Root of Section Chief Qin's "Power"
    The Chongqing Daily published a sketch on October 12th, entitled "The 'Power' of the Personnel Section Chief." It said that a factory in Chongqing transferred a batch of workers from various steel and machinery factories in the city, and after more than fifty days, some of them were still idle. They criticized the personnel section for not planning the transfer work. When Qin Hua, the head of the personnel section, heard the criticism, he suddenly jumped up from his seat, glared, and raised his voice to roar: "Who doesn't know that all factories need technical workers now? The factory director can ask for people whenever he wants them, no matter the time. Do you know the difficulty I have as the head of the personnel section? If I don't seize this opportunity, where will I find them when we need them in the future?"
    Section Chief Qin roared at the critics, wielding his "power," and his behavior is indeed unacceptable. However, does this incident reflect only the issue of Section Chief Qin's behavior? If there wasn't a factory director who "asks for people whenever he wants them, no matter the time," how would the personnel section "stockpile workers"? If the leading organs that approved the transfer of people from various factories had worked more thoroughly and disagreed with factories that shouldn't increase their workforce from transferring people, how would the personnel section "stockpile workers"?
    Dig Deeper
    On October 10th, the Lüda Daily published a letter from worker Jingzi, criticizing certain cadres of the Dalian Shipyard's Mechanical Plant for treating advanced and ordinary workers differently. On October 17th, the Lüda Daily published the Mechanical Plant's Party General Branch's self-criticism and explanation. The self-criticism and explanation admitted that they lacked sufficient and correct understanding of cultivating advanced figures, and therefore adopted the erroneous attitude of rather encouraging more and criticizing less or not criticizing at all when individual advanced figures showed shortcomings. For example, when advanced producer Li Yuanteng scrapped a small part in July, the section chief privately got him another piece of material to make a new one.
    I believe this analysis is true, but we still need to understand what "lacking sufficient and correct understanding in thought" refers to. Is it fear that criticizing the shortcomings of advanced producers will affect their enthusiasm, or is it fear that they will lose their prestige among the masses? To avoid anyone "adopting the attitude of rather encouraging more and criticizing less or not criticizing at all" in the future, it is necessary to dig deeper.

    秦科长“威力”的根源
    10月12日的重庆日报，发表一篇小品文，题目叫“人事科长的‘威力’”。说重庆某厂从该市各钢铁厂、机械厂调来一批工人，五十多天以后，有的人还闲着没事干，就批评人事科的调人工作没计划。人事科秦华科长听到了批评，猛然从座位上跳了起来，瞪着眼，提高着嗓子吼道：“谁不知道现在各厂都需要技术工人？厂长无论啥时候，说要人就要人，你们知道我当人事科长的困难吗？这阵不抓住，将来需要时那里去找？”
    秦科长对批评的人怒吼，施展“威力”，作风确实要不得。然而，这件事所反映的仅仅是秦科长的作风问题吗？要是没有“无论在啥时候，说要人就要人”的厂长，人事科怎么会“囤积工人”呢？要是批准从各厂调人的领导机关工作深入一些，不同意不该增加工人的工厂调人，人事科怎么会“囤积工人”呢？
    再挖一挖
    10月10日，旅大日报发表工人晶子的来信，批评大连造船公司机械厂某些干部对先进和普通工人分两种待遇。10月17日，旅大日报又发表了机械厂党总支的检讨和说明。检讨和说明承认：对培养先进人物方面，在思想上缺乏足够和正确的认识，因此对个别先进人物出现缺点的时候，抱着宁肯多鼓励，尽量少批评和不批评的错误态度。如先进生产者李元腾在7月份干废了一个小零件，工段长便私自给他搞一块料，重新做了一个。
    我相信这个分析是真实的，不过还需要了解“思想上缺乏足够和正确的认识”所指的是什么？是怕批评先进生产者的缺点，就影响他们的积极性呢，还是怕他们丧失在群众中的威信？为了避免今后不再有人“抱宁肯多鼓励，尽量少批评和不批评的态度”，实有深挖一步的必要。
