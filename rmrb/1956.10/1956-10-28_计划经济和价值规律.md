    Planned Economy and the Law of Value
    Xue Muqiao
    Our socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory, and the socialist economy now occupies an absolutely dominant position in the national economy. This situation makes it possible for us to further expand the scope of planned management and basically incorporate the main parts of the national economy into the state plan. Everyone knows that a planned economy is governed by the laws of the socialist economy. It is not governed by the law of value. On the contrary, it must restrain the law of value and reduce the role of the law of value in the national economy. But does this mean that after the completion of the socialist transformation, the law of value will not play a role in my country's national economy, or will it only play a very small role, so it can be ignored? That is not the case. The law of value will continue to play an important role in my country's national economy for a long time to come; to master this law well and use this law to serve socialist construction is still an important task for my country's economic workers.
    The reason why the law of value will continue to play an important role in my country's national economic plan is: First, commodity production will still widely exist in my country not only before the completion of the socialist transformation, but also after the completion of the socialist transformation. Various consumer goods produced by socialist state-owned enterprises must be distributed to the people across the country through market exchanges, and various products of cooperatives and individual laborers must be exchanged through the market to meet the needs of the state and the people. Of course, the production and circulation of these commodities cannot be unaffected by the law of value, and the law of value still plays a regulatory role to a certain extent. Second, the allocation of materials (means of production) produced by socialist enterprises that do not go through market exchanges, although not regulated by the law of value, are still affected by the law of value to a certain extent. Experience tells us that the economic accounting of socialist enterprises can only be carried out correctly by using the law of value. Because our economic accounting cannot be carried out without currency, and cannot but be based on the prices of various products. If the prices of various products we stipulate completely lack objective standards and completely violate the law of value, then all our economic accounting will become subjective and lack scientific basis. Compiling plans and guiding economic activities based on this subjective economic accounting will inevitably lead to waste and even cause chaos. For example, if we stipulate that the price of bean cake is higher than that of soybeans, then people will use soybeans to fertilize the fields, and no one will be willing to use soybeans to extract oil; if we stipulate that the price of wheat bran is higher than that of wheat, then people will use wheat to feed pigs, and no one will be willing to use wheat to grind flour. In such a situation, people will not be able to distinguish who is saving and who is wasting, and it is even possible to regard saving as waste and waste as saving. Such economic accounting is obviously just a meaningless number game. In the past, some comrades did not fully recognize the importance of using the law of value for economic accounting. They believed that socialist countries can be free from the constraints of the law of value when setting product prices. This understanding is obviously wrong.
    How to use the law of value to carry out economic accounting is a very important issue. I have not done any special research on this issue. Here, I would like to express some immature opinions only on the role of the law of value in socialist commodity production, especially on how to use the regulatory role of the law of value to serve socialist construction. This is a new issue, we have little experience, and we have not done systematic research. Errors are inevitable. I hope readers will conduct extensive discussions on this issue.
    Before the victorious completion of our country's socialist transformation, non-socialist economic components, namely capitalist economy and small-scale commodity economy, still widely existed in our country's national economy. Needless to say, these two economic components are regulated by the law of value, and we must use the law of value to gradually incorporate these economic components into the state plan. In the past few years, the most important tool we used to regulate agricultural and handicraft production was the price policy. In the past few years, we have separately increased the purchase prices of grain, cotton and some handicrafts to encourage the production enthusiasm of farmers and handicraftsmen, and to adjust the proportional relationship within agricultural and handicraft production. The state's planned purchase policy for grain, cotton and oil crops has indeed greatly reduced the scope of free trade in these products, thus correspondingly reducing the role of the law of value; but the planned purchase policy itself is also realized through correct price policies. When we purchase these products, we basically maintain the original market prices, so that farmers who produce these products can get the same amount of benefits as in the past when they sell these products according to state regulations. This is a very important reason why our planned purchase policy can be successfully implemented in a short period of time. Now, the non-planned purchase products produced by farmers, and the remaining part of the planned purchase products after being purchased by the state according to regulations, will still be sold freely on the market. In order to ensure that these products can be produced and circulated normally, it is still necessary to master the correct price policy. These facts fully illustrate that the law of value plays an important role in my country's agricultural and handicraft production.
    Capitalist production is not only regulated by the law of value, but also by the law of surplus value; these enterprises must provide a certain amount of profit to the capitalists in order to maintain normal production and operation. Therefore, when the state develops processing orders and unified purchase and sales relationships with private industries, and develops distribution and agency sales relationships with private commerce, it must enable industrialists and businessmen to obtain reasonable profits. And it should be based on the needs of the state and the people, and the market supply and demand situation, to give different amounts of profits to various products to adjust the production and circulation quantity of these products, so that it roughly meets the requirements of the state plan. If the processing fees or profits stipulated for processing orders are inappropriate, and the wholesale and retail price differences or handling fees stipulated for distribution and agency sales are inappropriate, that is to say, we have adopted an inappropriate price policy, it will also make the production and operation of these industrial and commercial enterprises unable to proceed normally according to the requirements of the state. In the past few years, the Party and the government have continuously strengthened the socialist economic components and consolidated its leading position in the national economy; on the other hand, they have correctly used the law of value and the law of surplus value, and mastered the correct price policy, thus ensuring that the socialist economy can defeat the capitalist economy in the peaceful competition with the capitalist economy, and gradually make the capitalist economy accept socialist transformation. If we violate the objective laws of economic development and adopt subjective and mandatory methods, it is obviously impossible to obtain such a huge victory.
    In the past few years, our work has been basically successful, but it is not without shortcomings. Our main shortcomings are: First, some industrial products are uniformly purchased and sold by state-owned trading companies, and a layer-by-layer distribution system is implemented between the head offices and branches of state-owned trading companies, which cannot be freely selected. Therefore, the variety and design of these industrial products cannot be changed at any time to meet the needs of the people, and even some daily necessities have experienced a reduction in variety and design and a decline in quality. Second, the unified purchase and sales and distribution system makes the law of value unable to play a regulatory role. Products with the same cost but different quality are often sold at the same price, and they all have sales, which is obviously not in line with the policy of high quality and high price, rewarding the advanced and spurring the backward. Third, some minor agricultural and sideline products are uniformly purchased by state-owned trading companies and supply and marketing cooperatives. When their purchases are not timely or the purchase prices are too low, it often leads to reduced production of these agricultural and sideline products, which not only reduces the income of farmers and handicraftsmen, but also affects domestic and foreign market supply. These facts illustrate from another aspect that if we do not make full use of the law of value under possible conditions, and use correct price policies to carry out natural regulation of certain economic activities, then some shortcomings will inevitably arise, causing undue losses to the state and the people.
    It should be pointed out that in the past few years, in order to prevent private industrialists and businessmen from speculating and disrupting the market and price stability, there was sufficient reason for us to take these relatively strict management measures. Under the conditions of tight supply of certain important consumer goods, these measures have maintained price stability and basically met the people's living needs; comparing these achievements with the above-mentioned shortcomings, it should be said that the achievements are the main ones, and the shortcomings are secondary, and only temporary phenomena. But we must never allow these shortcomings to continue to develop. Now capitalist industry and commerce have completed the joint state-private ownership, and these joint ventures are in fact directly managed by the state, and my country's economic situation has undergone fundamental changes. Under this new situation, we are now able to reduce the scope of unified purchase and sales, correct the past problems of excessive and rigid control, and adopt free selection and free regulation methods within a certain range, so that the above-mentioned shortcomings can be gradually eliminated and not continue to develop.
    Under the above-mentioned new situation, what changes will take place in the role of the law of value in my country's national economy? My personal understanding is that due to the changes in my country's economic situation, the role of the law of value in the national economy will be greatly reduced objectively, and the scope of the law of value will be greatly reduced. But precisely because of this, subjectively, we will have the necessity and possibility to more freely use the law of value and use it as a supplement to the state plan. Because the people's living needs are multifaceted, very complex and often change, it is obviously impossible to regulate all economic activities with the state plan. The state plan can only control all the main parts of economic activities; there are many industrial and agricultural products that are small in quantity, various in variety, and difficult for the state to manage. We still need to use the law of value to regulate their production and circulation quantity, so that they can meet the different requirements of the people in terms of variety and design, and quality at any time. Such measures are undoubtedly what we should take.
    In the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, important guidelines have been put forward for the above-mentioned issues. In Comrade Zhou Enlai's report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy on behalf of the Central Committee, he pointed out that "due to the victory of the socialist transformation, the socialist economy has occupied an absolute dominant position in our country, which makes it possible for us to better use the law of value within an appropriate scope to influence the production of industrial and agricultural products with small output value and various varieties that do not need to be uniformly purchased and sold by the state, in order to meet the diverse living needs of the people. In order to adapt to the above-mentioned situation and prevent the phenomenon of product quality decline and variety reduction due to excessive and rigid unification, we will take many important measures in commerce now and during the Second Five-Year Plan. For example, under the leadership of the national unified market, we will plan to organize a part of the free market; within a certain range, we will implement self-production and self-sales of products; for some daily industrial products, we will promote the selection method; for all commodities, we will implement the method of pricing according to quality grading, etc. Taking these measures will not only not undermine the national unified market, but on the contrary, will play a beneficial supplementary role to the national unified market."
    In Comrade Chen Yun's important speech, a more thorough explanation was given to this issue. He said: "The situation of our socialist economy will be like this: In terms of industrial and commercial production and operation, state-owned and collective-owned enterprises are the main body of industry and commerce, but there are a certain number of individual operations attached. This individual operation is a supplement to state-owned and collective-owned enterprises. In terms of the planning of production, the main part of the national industrial and agricultural products is produced according to the plan, but at the same time, a part of the products is produced freely within the scope permitted by the state plan according to market changes. Planned production is the main body of industrial and agricultural production, and free production within the scope permitted by the state plan according to market changes is a supplement to planned production. Therefore, the market of this socialist economy is by no means a capitalist free market, but a socialist unified market. In the socialist unified market, the state market is its main body, but there is a free market led by the state within a certain range. This free market is under the leadership of the state and serves as a supplement to the state market, so it is a component of the socialist unified market."
    In the future, our socialist economy will be composed of the following many large and small operations: The main part of state-owned operations is large-scale, and there is also a considerable part of small and medium-sized operations; collective operations are generally medium-sized, but there are also many small-scale operations. In addition to this, there are a certain number of individual operations attached, such as individual handicrafts, small vendors, individual agriculture and family operations of collective farmers, etc. Of course, large-scale operations are easy to adopt modern technology and implement more detailed division of labor, so the labor productivity is relatively high; but large-scale operations must produce and sell in large quantities, so it is not easy to adapt to those regional, small, and more complex varieties and designs. For example, many small handicrafts and agricultural and sideline industries are not suitable for large-scale production. Centralized large stores cannot adapt to the people's sporadic daily needs as well as decentralized small vendors. Many handicraft and agricultural and sideline products, whether produced by cooperatives or by individual laborers, will lose their advantages of decentralized operation if they are completely uniformly purchased and sold by state-owned stores or supply and marketing cooperatives; therefore, except for the export part that must still be arranged for purchase by state-owned stores and supply and marketing cooperatives, the local sales part should be encouraged to produce and sell themselves, and other state-owned enterprises and cooperatives should also be allowed to freely purchase. The main agricultural products such as grain and cotton produced by agricultural production cooperatives and individual farmers should continue to implement planned purchase, but the non-planned purchase products and the remaining part of the planned purchase products after being purchased by the state according to regulations should be allowed to be sold freely. When the state purchases various agricultural and handicraft products, it must stipulate appropriate prices, which must ensure that farmers, handicraftsmen and the cooperatives they organize can obtain appropriate benefits to encourage them to continue to develop production. Appropriate care should also be given to small vendors. If they perform distribution and agency sales tasks, they must be able to obtain a certain income; at the same time, they should be encouraged to implement self-purchase and self-sales within a certain range.
    The production and sales relationship of state-owned and joint state-private enterprises should also be appropriately changed to adapt to the new situation. For a few products that are most closely related to the people's lives, such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, edible oil, sugar, coal, etc., the commercial departments should still uniformly purchase and sell them in order to guarantee supply and stabilize the market. These products are currently in relatively tight supply and are large in quantity and relatively simple in variety; therefore, it is necessary and possible for the commercial departments to uniformly allocate them. For other daily necessities with various varieties, the unified purchase and sales should be gradually stopped, and the selection method should be used instead. Not only state-owned trading companies and various joint state-private stores can freely select and purchase from various state-owned and joint state-private factories, but the head offices and branches of state-owned trading companies should also freely select and purchase from each other, state-owned trading companies and various joint state-private stores and various distribution and agency sales stores, and cancel the distribution method. They can also directly purchase from factories or other wholesale institutions. After adopting the selection method, various commodities with good quality, varieties and designs that meet the needs of the people can be sold well everywhere, and high quality can get high prices; otherwise, it will be difficult to sell, and they will have to be sold at low prices, and strive to improve quality and change varieties and designs to meet the needs of the people. Commercial departments should still do their best to carry out reasonable allocation of various daily necessities, be responsible for stabilizing prices, and ensure market supply. They enjoy the right to prioritize the selection and purchase of these commodities. Therefore, state-owned trading companies are still the main body for regulating market supply and demand, and free trade is a beneficial supplement to state-owned trade. We allow free trade within a certain range in order to more effectively use the law of value to assist state-owned trade in meeting the diverse, complex, and ever-changing various living needs of the people.
    To adapt to these new situations, our national plan must also consider taking some new measures. In order to ensure the needs of national construction and the people's lives, we must incorporate all important products related to the national economy and the people's livelihood into the national plan in various ways. For state-owned and joint state-private enterprises, direct planning can basically be implemented, and some particularly important indicators can be passed down to all grassroots enterprises layer by layer; for cooperatives, only indirect planning can be implemented, mainly through the purchase plan of commercial departments and correct price policies to regulate the production and circulation quantity of various important products. For various products, a graded management method should be adopted according to their importance and sales scope: particularly important products that are sold nationwide are directly managed by the central government, relatively important products that are sold within the regional scope are managed by the local government, and generally less important and sporadic products do not need to be included in the national plan, but are flexibly regulated by the commercial departments according to the specific situation through purchase and sales plans and price policies, and the law of value can also be used for free regulation in the free market. There are thousands or tens of thousands of daily necessities that people need; but only dozens to hundreds of them can be strictly managed by the state according to the plan, and only hundreds to thousands of them can be more effectively regulated by the commercial departments within the national scope. Other parts can only be regulated by the commercial departments within the local scope, or freely regulated by using the law of value. If the national plan is managed too much and too rigidly, it may have adverse results on rewarding production and meeting the people's living needs.
    In the past, there have been many cases of daily necessities with reduced varieties and designs, reduced quality, and temporary shortages, temporary backlogs, shortages here, and backlogs there. The production of many handicraft products and agricultural and sideline products has been very unstable, and even gradually reduced. This is partly due to the shortcomings in the work of the commercial departments. However, the people's living needs are so complex, and the market situation is ever-changing under the condition of widespread existence of private industry and commerce; it is obviously difficult to require commercial departments to grasp the market situation at any time and flexibly regulate thousands of commodities within the national scope. The universal existence of private industry and commerce may have an adverse impact on market stability on the one hand, forcing commercial departments to carry out stricter market management, but on the other hand, the universal existence of private industry and commerce is a good supplement to state-owned industry and commerce. They help state-owned industry and commerce to meet the people's multifaceted living needs within a certain range through the law of value; all sporadic items that state-owned industry and commerce cannot produce and operate can be encouraged to produce and operate by private industry and commerce through the law of value. After private industry and commerce complete the joint state-private ownership and are in fact directly managed by the state, the threat of them disrupting the market basically disappears, and their function of supplementing state-owned industry and commerce may also disappear accordingly. We must have a full estimate of this new situation. If we do not timely and actively use the law of value more effectively to supplement the state plan, the market situation may gradually become stagnant, and the above-mentioned shortcomings may not only not be quickly overcome, but may even develop further. Of course, the people do not welcome such a future.
    The new situation raises such a question for us: Must our socialist economy be completely transformed into state-owned and collective-owned enterprises? Can we allow a part of individual operations to continue to exist under the management of the state for a considerable period of time? Does our socialist economy only allow state-owned markets? Can we plan to retain some free markets under the leadership of the state market? Must we bring all economic activities into the national plan? Can we use the law of value to carry out free regulation within a certain range for the parts that are not easy for the state to directly manage? We believe that we can do this, and we should do this. At least before socialist construction is not completed, it is absolutely necessary to do this. Not doing so will make a big mistake. Is there any danger in doing this? Will it allow capitalism to revive and make our socialist transformation regress? We believe that it is absolutely impossible. The reason is that capitalist industry and commerce have completed the joint state-private ownership and are continuing to advance towards nationalization; individual agriculture and handicraft industries have also basically realized cooperation, and the cooperative system will be increasingly consolidated. The few individual operations controlled by the powerful state-owned economy and cooperative economy can never flood and cause disasters. At the same time, we have established a powerful state market, and have incorporated the important parts of the national economy into the national plan, and other parts are also controlled by the state-owned economy (especially the commercial departments); free trade within a certain range controlled by the state-owned economy can never shake the stability of the market. If such a phenomenon occurs, the state has sufficient power to quickly stop all destructive activities.
    In order to rapidly complete socialist construction, and in order to more effectively meet the diverse needs of the state and the people, true Marxists and Leninists will never refuse to use any useful weapons, and the law of value should be viewed in the same way. Believing that there should be no individual economy and no free trade in the socialist economy, and believing that we should only limit the law of value, but should not use the law of value to serve socialist construction, this is the idea of ​​dogmatists, not the idea of ​​Marxists and Leninists. Our purpose of building socialism is to develop production more rapidly, so as to better meet the growing living needs of the people on this basis; it is not to build socialism to realize the empty ideals of dogmatists. Grasping the spirit and essence of Marxism-Leninism, smashing the empty ideals of dogmatists, and completing the great cause of our country's socialist construction in a realistic way, this is the road we should choose.

    计划经济和价值规律
    薛暮桥
    我国的社会主义改造事业已经取得了决定性的胜利，社会主义经济现在已经在国民经济中占绝对统治地位。这种情况，使我们有可能进一步扩大计划管理的范围，把国民经济的主要部分基本上都纳入国家计划。谁都知道，计划经济是受社会主义经济规律支配的，它不受价值规律支配，相反地还要约束价值规律，降低价值规律在国民经济中的作用。但这是不是说，在社会主义改造完成以后，价值规律在我国的国民经济中将要不起作用，或者只起很小的作用，因而可以忽视这种规律了呢？不是这样。价值规律在今后很长的时间内，仍然将在我国国民经济中起重要作用；很好地掌握这个规律，利用这个规律来为社会主义建设服务，这仍然是我国经济工作者的一项重要任务。
    价值规律在我国国民经济计划中所以仍然将起重要作用，原因是：第一，我国不但在社会主义改造完成以前，而且在社会主义改造完成以后，商品生产仍将广泛存在。社会主义国营企业所生产的各种消费品都必须通过市场交换才能够分配给全国人民，合作社和个体劳动者的各种产品更必须经过市场交换才能用来满足国家和人民的需要。当然，这些商品的生产和流通，是不能不受价值规律影响的，价值规律在一定的程度上仍起调节作用。第二，社会主义企业所生产的不通过市场交换的调拨物资（生产资料），虽然不受价值规律调节，但在一定的程度上仍受价值规律影响。经验告诉我们，社会主义企业的经济核算，只有利用价值规律才能正确进行。因为现在我们的经济核算还不可能离开货币来进行，还不能不根据各种产品的价格来进行核算。如果我们所规定的各种产品价格完全缺乏客观标准，完全违反价值规律，那末我们的一切经济核算，也就变成主观的，缺乏科学根据的东西。根据这种主观的经济核算来编制计划，指导经济活动，必然会造成浪费，甚至引起混乱。举例来讲，假使我们规定豆饼的价格高于大豆，那末人们就会用大豆来肥田，谁也不愿意用大豆来榨油；假使我们规定麸皮的价格高于小麦，那末人们就会用小麦来喂猪，谁也不愿意用小麦来磨面。在这样的情况下，人们就无法分别谁是节约，谁是浪费，甚至有可能把节约当作浪费，而把浪费当做节约。这样的经济核算，显然只是无意义的数字游戏罢了。过去有些同志对于利用价值规律来进行经济核算的重要性认识不足，他们认为社会主义国家在规定产品价格的时候可以不受价值规律约束，这样的认识显然是错误的。
    如何利用价值规律来进行经济核算是一个十分重要的问题。对于这个问题，我没有做过专门的研究。这里我仅就在社会主义商品生产中价值规律所起作用的问题，特别是对如何利用价值规律的调节作用来为社会主义建设服务的问题，发表一些不成熟的意见。这是一个新的问题，我们的经验不多，也没有做过系统的研究，错误一定是难于避免的，希望读者对这问题进行广泛的讨论。
    在我国的社会主义改造事业胜利完成以前，我国国民经济中还广泛地存在着非社会主义的经济成份，即资本主义经济和小商品经济。不用说，这两种经济成份，是受价值规律调节的，我们必须利用价值规律，通过价值规律，才能够把这些经济成份逐步纳入国家计划。几年来，我们调节农业和手工业生产的最重要的工具，就是价格政策。在过去几年中，我们曾经分别地提高了粮食、棉花和某些手工业品的收购价格，以鼓励农民和手工业者的生产的积极性，并调整农业和手工业生产内部的比例关系。国家对粮食、棉花和油料作物等的计划收购政策，固然在很大的程度上缩小了这些产品的自由贸易的范围，因而相应地降低了价值规律的作用；但计划收购政策本身，也是通过了正确的价格政策来实现的。我们在收购这些产品的时候，基本上保持了原来的市场价格，使生产这些产品的农民在按国家规定出售这些产品的时候，能够像过去一样得到同样多的利益，这是我们的计划收购政策所以能够在短时期内顺利实现的一个极重要的原因。现在，农民所生产的非计划收购的产品，和计划收购产品在按规定由国家收购后的剩余部分，仍然将在市场自由出售。为着保证这些产品能够正常地生产和流通，仍然必须掌握正确的价格政策。这些事实充分说明，价值规律在我国的农业和手工业生产中是起着重要作用的。
    资本主义生产不但要受价值规律调节，而且要受剩余价值规律调节；这些企业必须向资本家提供一定数量的利润，这样才能够保持正常的生产和经营。因此，国家对私营工业发展加工定货和统购包销关系的时候，对私营商业发展经销代销关系的时候，都必须使工商业资本家能够得到合理的利润。并且应该根据国家和人民的需要，以及市场供求情况，对各类产品分别给以多少不同的利润，以调节这些产品的生产和流通数量，使之大体上符合于国家计划的要求。如果我们对加工定货所规定的工缴费或利润不适当，对经销代销所规定的批零差价或手续费不适当，也就是说，我们采取了不适当的价格政策，同样会使这些工商企业的生产和经营不能够按照国家的要求正常地进行。几年来，党和政府一方面不断地壮大社会主义经济成份，并巩固它在国民经济中的领导地位；另一方面，又正确地利用了价值规律和剩余价值规律，掌握了正确的价格政策，因而在与资本主义经济和平竞赛中，保证社会主义经济能够战胜资本主义经济，并使资本主义经济逐步接受社会主义改造。如果我们违反了经济发展的客观规律，而采取主观主义和强迫命令的办法，显然是不可能得到这样巨大的胜利的。
    过去几年，我们的工作基本上是成功的，但也不是没有缺点。我们的主要缺点是：第一，有些工业品因为由国营贸易公司统购包销，而且在国营贸易公司的总分支机构之间实行层层派货制度，不能自由选择，因此这些工业品的品种和花色，就不能适应人民的需要而随时变化，某些日用百货甚至发生品种花色减少和质量降低的现象。第二，统购包销和派货制度使价值规律不能发挥调节作用，某些成本相同而质量优劣不相同的产品，往往仍以同一价格出售，而且同样都有销路，这与优质优价，奖励先进和鞭策落后的方针显然是不符合的。第三，有些次要的农产品和手工业品因为由国营贸易公司和供销合作社统一收购，在它们收购不及时，或者收购价格偏低的时候，往往引起这些农产品和手工业品的减产，不但减少了农民和手工业者的收入，而且影响国内外的市场供应。这些事实从另一方面说明，假使我们不在可能的条件下充分利用价值规律，利用正确的价格政策来对某些经济活动进行自然调节，那就会不可避免地产生一些缺点，而使国家和人民受到不应有的损失。
    应当指出，过去几年为着防止私营工商业者投机取巧，破坏市场和物价的稳定，我们采取这些比较严格的管理办法是有充分理由的。这些办法，在某些重要消费品供不应求的条件下，保持了物价的稳定，并基本上满足了人民的生活需要；把这些成绩与上述缺点比较起来，应该说成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的，而且仅仅是一时的现象。但是我们决不能够因此而让这些缺点继续发展下去。现在资本主义工商业已经完成了公私合营工作，这些合营企业事实上已由国家直接管理，我国的经济情况已经发生了根本性的变化。在这新情况下，我们已有可能缩小统购包销的范围，纠正过去管的过多、过死的毛病，在一定的范围内采取自由选择、自由调节的办法，使上述缺点能够逐渐消灭，而不至于继续发展。
    在上述新情况下，价值规律在我国国民经济中的作用将要发生一些什么变化呢？我个人的认识是：由于我国经济情况的变化，价值规律在国民经济中的作用，在客观上将大大降低，价值规律发生作用的范围是大大缩小了。但正因为如此，在主观上，我们将有必要和可能更加放手地来利用价值规律，利用它来作为国家计划的补充。由于人民的生活需要是多方面的，十分复杂而且常常变化，因此用国家计划来调节一切经济活动，显然是一件不可能的事情。国家计划只能控制经济活动中的一切主要部分；有许多工业品和农产品数量不大，品种繁多，国家不易管理，我们还有必要利用价值规律来调节它们的生产和流通数量，使它们在品种和花色上，在质量上随时适应人民各不相同的要求。这样的措施，无疑地是我们所应该采取的。
    在中国共产党的第八次全国代表大会中，对于上述问题已经提出了重要的方针。在周恩来同志代表中央所作关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告中，指出“由于社会主义改造事业的胜利，社会主义经济已经在我国占居了绝对的统治地位，这就使我们有可能在适当的范围内，更好地运用价值规律，来影响那些不必要由国家统购包销的、产值不大的、品种繁多的工农业产品的生产，以满足人民多样的生活需要。为了适应上述情况，防止由于统一过多过死而发生产品质量下降和品种减少的现象，现在和在第二个五年计划期间，我们在商业方面，将采取许多重要措施。例如，在国家统一市场的领导下，将有计划地组织一部分自由市场；在一定范围内，将实行产品的自产自销；对某些日用工业品，将推行选购办法；对所有商品，将实行按质分等论价办法，等等。采取这些措施，不仅不会破坏国家的统一市场，相反地，将会对国家的统一市场起有益的补充作用。”
    在陈云同志所作重要发言中，对这问题作了更透彻的解释。他说：“我们的社会主义经济的情况将是这样：在工商业生产经营方面，国家经营和集体经营是工商业的主体，但是附有一定数量的个体经营。这种个体经营是国家经营和集体经营的补充。在生产的计划性方面，全国工农业产品的主要部分是按照计划生产的，但是同时有一部分产品是按照市场变化而在国家计划许可范围内自由生产的，计划生产是工农业生产的主体，按照市场变化而在国家计划许可范围内的自由生产是计划生产的补充。因此，这种社会主义经济的市场，决不是资本主义的自由市场，而是社会主义的统一市场。在社会主义的统一市场里，国家市场是它的主体，但是附有一定范围内国家领导的自由市场。这种自由市场，是在国家领导之下，作为国家市场的补充，因此它是社会主义统一市场的组成部分。”
    今后我们的社会主义经济将由下列许多大小经营组成：国家经营中的主要部分是大规模的，此外还有相当大一部分中小规模的经营；集体经营一般是中等规模的，但也有许多小规模的经营。除此以外，还附有一定数量的个体经营，如个体手工业、小商贩、个体农业和集体农民的家庭经营等。当然，大规模的经营容易采用现代化的技术和实行较细致的分工，因而劳动生产率比较高；但是大规模的经营必须大量生产和大量销售，因此很不容易适应那些地区性的、小量的、品种花色比较复杂的需要。例如，有许多小手工业和农副业是不适宜于大规模生产的，集中的大商店不如分散的小商贩更能适应人民零星的日常的需要。许多手工业和农副业产品，不论是由合作社生产或者是由个体劳动者生产，如果完全由国营商店或供销合作社来统购包销，则将丧失其分散经营的优点；因此除外销部分仍必须由国营商店和供销合作社来布置收购以外，就地销售部分应该鼓励它们自产自销，同时应该准许其他国营企业和合作社来自由采购。农业生产合作社和个体农民所生产的主要农产品如粮食棉花等仍应继续实行计划收购，但非计划收购的产品和计划收购产品按照国家规定收购后的剩余部分，应该允许自由出售。国家在收购各种农产品和手工业品的时候，必须规定适当的价格，这种价格必须保证农民、手工业者和他们所组织的合作社能够得到适当的利益，以奖励他们继续发展生产。对小商贩也应该给以适当的照顾，如果他们执行经销代销任务，必须使他们能得到一定的收益；同时应该鼓励他们在一定的范围内实行自购自销。
    国营和公私合营企业的产销关系，也应该适应新的情况作适当的改变。对少数同人民生活关系最密切的产品，如棉纱、棉布、食油、食糖、煤炭等，仍应当由商业部门统购包销，以便保证供应，稳定市场。这些产品目前大部分是供应比较紧张，而且数量很大，品种比较简单；因此，由商业部门来统一分配是必要的、可能的。对其它品种繁多的日用百货，则应该逐步停止统购包销，改用选购办法。不但国营贸易公司和各公私合营商店对各国营和公私合营工厂可以自由选购，国营贸易公司的各总分支机构之间，国营贸易公司与各公私合营商店和各经销代销商店之间也应当自由选购，取消派货办法，它们也可以向工厂或其它批发机构直接采购。采取选购办法以后，各种质量好、品种花色适合人民需要的商品便可以畅销各地，优质得到优价；反之，就会销售困难，不得不低价推销，并努力提高质量和改变品种花色来适合人民的需要。商业部门对各日用百货仍然应当尽自己的力量来进行合理分配，负责稳定物价，保证市场供应，它们对于这些商品享有优先选购的权利，因此，国营贸易公司仍然是调节市场供求的主体，而自由贸易则是国营贸易的有益的补充。我们容许一定范围内的自由贸易，为的是要更有效地利用价值规律，来辅助国营贸易多方面的满足人民复杂的、常常变化的各种生活需要。
    适应这些新的情况，我们的国家计划也必须考虑采取一些新的措施。为着保证国家建设和人民生活需要，我们必须把有关国计民生的一切重要产品采取各种方式分别纳入国家计划。对国营和公私合营企业基本上可以实行直接计划，把一些特别重要的指标层层下达到所有基层企业；对合作社则只能实行间接计划，主要通过商业部门的收购计划和正确的价格政策，来调节各种重要产品的生产和流通数量。对于各种产品，应该按其重要程度和销售范围，而采取分级管理的办法：特别重要而且销售全国的产品由中央直接管理，比较重要而在地区范围以内销售的产品则由地方管理，一般次要的、零星的产品则不必列入国家计划，而由商业部门按照具体情况，通过购销计划和价格政策来灵活调节，同时还可以在自由市场上利用价值规律来进行自由调节。人民所需要的日用百货有几千种、几万种；但能够由国家按照计划来严格管理的只可能有几十种到几百种，能够通过商业部门来在全国范围以内比较有效地进行调节的也只能有几百种到几千种。其它部分只能够由商业部门在地方范围以内进行调节，或者利用价值规律进行自由调节。国家计划如果管得过多、过死，对奖励生产和满足人民生活需要都可能产生不利的结果。
    过去有许多日用百货品种花色减少、质量降低，而且一时脱销，一时积压，这里脱销，那里积压，有许多手工业产品和农副业产品生产很不稳定，甚至逐渐减产，这一部分是由于商业部门工作中的缺点所造成的。但是，人民的生活需要是如此复杂，市场情况在私营工商业广泛存在的条件下又是千变万化；要求商业部门随时掌握市场情况，在全国范围以内对几千种商品进行灵活调节，这显然是很困难的事情。私营工商业的普遍存在，一方面对市场稳定可能产生不利影响，使商业部门不得不进行较严格的市场管理，但在另一方面，私营工商业的普遍存在，对国营工商业又是很好的补充，它们在一定的范围内通过价值规律，帮助国营工商业来满足人民多方面的生活需要；一切国营工商业所不能生产和经营的零星物品，可以通过价值规律鼓励私营工商业来生产和经营。在私营工商业完成公私合营，事实上由国家直接管理以后，它们扰乱市场的威胁基本上消失了，它们补充国营工商业的机能，也有可能随之消失。对于这种新的情况，我们必须有充分的估计。如果我们不及时地、主动地来更有效地利用价值规律，用以补充国家计划，则市场情况将有可能逐渐呆滞，上述缺点不但不能迅速克服，且有可能更加发展起来。当然，人民是并不欢迎这样的前途的。
    新的情况向我们提出这样一个问题：我们的社会主义经济是否必须完全变为国家经营和集体经营，是否可以在一个相当长的时期内，让一部分个体经营在国家的管理下继续存在？我们的社会主义经济是否只容许有国家市场，是否可以在国家市场的领导下有计划地保留一些自由市场？我们是不是必须把一切经济活动统统纳入国家计划，能不能对国家不易直接管理的部分，利用价值规律来进行一定范围内的自由调节？我们认为，可以这样做，而且应该这样做，至少在社会主义建设尚未完成以前，这样做是完全必要的，不这样做就会犯很大的错误。这样做是不是会有危险呢？会不会让资本主义死灰复燃，使我们的社会主义改造向后倒退呢？我们认为决不可能。原因是，资本主义工商业已经完成公私合营，正在向国有化继续前进；个体的农业和手工业也已经基本上实现合作化，合作制将日益巩固起来。在强大的国营经济和合作社经济控制下的少数个体经营，是决不可能泛滥成灾的。同时，我们已经建立了强大的国家市场，已经把国民经济中的重要部分纳入国家计划，其它部分亦受国营经济（特别是商业部门）控制；在国营经济控制下的一定范围内的自由贸易，决不可能动摇市场的稳定的。如果发生这样现象，国家是有充分的力量来迅速制止一切破坏活动的。
    为着迅速完成社会主义建设，为着更有效地满足国家和人民的多方面的需要，真正的马克思列宁主义者是决不会拒绝利用任何有用的武器的，对于价值规律也应该这样看待。认为在社会主义经济内不应当有个体经济，不应当有自由贸易，认为我们只应当限制价值规律，而不应当利用价值规律来为社会主义建设服务，这是教条主义者的想法，而不是马克思列宁主义者的想法。我们建设社会主义的目的是为更迅速地发展生产，以便在这基础之上更好地来满足人民日益增长的生活需要；并不是为实现教条主义者的空洞理想而来建设社会主义。掌握马克思列宁主义的精神和实质，粉碎教条主义者的空洞理想，实事求是地来完成我国的社会主义建设的伟大事业，这是我们所应当选择的道路。
