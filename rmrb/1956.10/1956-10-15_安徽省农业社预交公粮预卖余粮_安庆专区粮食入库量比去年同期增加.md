Xinhua News Agency Report: Agricultural production cooperatives in non-disaster areas of Anhui Province are prepaying public grain and pre-selling surplus grain before the autumn harvest distribution within the cooperatives. This method not only demonstrates the enthusiasm of agricultural cooperative members in supporting national construction, but also solves their difficulties in storing large quantities of grain. The Magang Agricultural Cooperative in Feidong County, before carrying out the autumn harvest distribution and selling surplus grain or paying public grain, found that the harvested grain could no longer fit in the warehouses, so it had to be piled up in rice sheds, cow houses, and on the threshing grounds, resulting in some grain becoming moldy and sprouting. Later, the cooperative management committee decided to pre-distribute some of the grain to the members, sell 600,000 jin of surplus grain, and also pay a portion of the public grain.

After the realization of agricultural cooperation in Anhui Province, the grain procurement work is basically carried out with agricultural cooperatives as the unit. Initially, agricultural cooperatives did not dare to pay public grain or sell surplus grain before the autumn harvest distribution was completed and late autumn crops were harvested, fearing that they would sell too much grain. According to the above situation, the grain departments of Anhui Province, in agricultural cooperatives in non-disaster areas, have adopted the method of pre-collecting and pre-purchasing grain based on the actual figures of public grain payment and surplus grain sales last year, and then making a final settlement after the agricultural cooperative's income distribution is completed. This not only solves the grain storage difficulties of agricultural cooperatives, but also ensures that the grain procurement task can be completed on schedule. The Anqing Special District, which adopted this method the earliest, had completed more than half of its grain procurement plan by the end of September, and the amount of grain stored in warehouses increased by 72% compared with the same period last year.

### 安徽省农业社预交公粮预卖余粮  安庆专区粮食入库量比去年同期增加

    安徽省农业社预交公粮预卖余粮
    安庆专区粮食入库量比去年同期增加
    据新华社讯　安徽省非灾区的农业生产合作社，在社里秋收分配以前，首先预交公粮、预卖余粮。他们用这个办法不但表现了农业社社员们支援国家建设的热情，而且，也解决了他们保管大批粮食的困难。肥东县马岗农业社在没有进行秋收分配和没有卖余粮、交公粮以前，收获的粮食仓库已装不下，只好堆在稻棚、牛屋和场地上，以致有些粮食霉烂生芽。后来社务管理委员会才决定把这些粮食预分一部分给社员，又出售余粮六十万斤，并且还交纳了一部分公粮。
    安徽省实现农业合作化以后，粮食的征购工作基本上是以农业社为单位进行的。开始时，农业社在秋收分配没有完成和晚秋作物没有收割以前，不敢交公粮、卖余粮，怕把粮食卖过头。安徽省粮食部门根据上述情况，在非灾区的农业社按照去年交公粮和卖余粮的实际数字，先行预征预购粮食，等农业社收入分配完毕，再最后结算。这样既解决了农业社的粮食保管困难，也可以保证粮食征购任务能按期完成。采用这个办法最早的安庆专区，到9月底就已完成粮食征购计划的一半以上，粮食入库量比去年同期增加了72％。
