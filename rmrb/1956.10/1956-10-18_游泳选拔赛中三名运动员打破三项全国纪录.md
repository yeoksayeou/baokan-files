Three Athletes Break Three National Records in Swimming Trials

    (Our newspaper reports) The swimming trials for the Chinese Olympic team have concluded. Five events were held in the Beijing Gymnasium swimming pool on the afternoon of the 17th. Mu Xiangxiong, Lin Jinzhu, and Dai Lihua broke the national records in the men's 200-meter breaststroke, the men's 200-meter freestyle, and the women's 100-meter backstroke, respectively.
    Mu Xiangxiong's time in the 200-meter breaststroke yesterday was 2 minutes 38.9 seconds, breaking Xu Zhixiang's national record of 2 minutes 42 seconds, but it did not reach his own national best of 2 minutes 36 seconds. After diving into the water, Mu Xiangxiong swam underwater until he reached 40 meters before coming up for air. Also competing in the same group as Mu Xiangxiong were China's excellent swimmers Qi Lieyun and Xu Zhixiang, who respectively took second and third place.
    Lin Jinzhu's time in the 200-meter freestyle was 2 minutes 10.9 seconds, 0.1 seconds faster than his own national record. The competition was fierce, as Mu Ruilong, Li Xiqing, Lin Li, Zhang Tianhui and other swimming masters were also in the same group. After the starting gun fired, the six athletes progressed side by side, with little difference between them. Only in the last fifty meters did Lin Jinzhu strengthen his sprint, leaving the others behind one by one and reaching the finish line first.
    Dai Lihua's time in the women's 100-meter backstroke was 1 minute 23.7 seconds, 1.3 seconds faster than the national record.
    The other two events were the women's 100-meter butterfly and the men's 100-meter backstroke. Zhao Jinqing and Huang Tamsheng won first place respectively, with times of 1 minute 28.5 seconds and 1 minute 12.3 seconds.

    游泳选拔赛中三名运动员打破三项全国纪录
    本报讯　中国奥林匹克运动队的游泳选拔比赛已经结束。17日下午在北京体育馆游泳馆继续举行了五项比赛。穆祥雄、林锦珠和戴丽华分别打破了男子二百公尺蛙泳、男子二百公尺自由泳和女子一百公尺仰泳的全国最高纪录。
    穆祥雄二百公尺蛙泳昨天的成绩是二分三十八秒九，打破了徐致祥创造的二分四十二秒的全国最高纪录，但是没有达到他自己创造的二分三十六秒的全国最高成绩。穆祥雄在跳入水中后，一直潜泳，游到四十公尺时才划出水面呼吸。和穆祥雄在同一组比赛的还有我国优秀的游泳运动员戚烈云和徐致祥，他们分别获得了第二名和第三名。
    林锦珠二百公尺自由泳的成绩是二分十秒九，比他自己保持的全国最高纪录快了零点一秒。这场比赛竞争得很激烈，因为在同一组比赛的还有穆瑞龙、李喜庆、林立、张天辉等游泳名手。枪声响后，六名运动员并肩前进，始终相差无几，只是在最后五十公尺时，林锦珠加强了冲刺，才将其余的人一一抛在后面而第一个到达终点。
    戴丽华的女子一百公尺仰泳的成绩是一分二十三秒七，比全国最高纪录快了一点三秒。
    另外两项是女子一百公尺蝶泳和男子一百公尺仰泳。赵锦清和黄潭胜分别获得第一名，他们的成绩是一分二十八秒五和一分十二秒三。
