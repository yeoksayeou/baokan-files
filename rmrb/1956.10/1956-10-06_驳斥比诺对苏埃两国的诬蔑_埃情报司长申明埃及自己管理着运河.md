Xinhua News Agency, October 4th, Cairo dispatch: Egyptian Intelligence Director Hatem stated on the evening of October 3rd that French Foreign Minister Pinay's remarks on October 2nd in Caracas, Venezuela, regarding the nationalization of the Suez Canal, are part of a slander campaign against Egypt.

Hatem said: Pinay "has been engaging in the business of spreading lies. He said that a Soviet official is supervising the navigation work of the canal, but his lies have been exposed by the large number of ships passing through the canal every day guided by Egyptian pilots." Hatem emphasized, "Egypt manages the canal independently."

Referring to Pinay's claim that Egypt has taken aggressive actions, Hatem said, "Obviously, France's actions in Algeria are exactly that. These are the actions of beasts, actions that violate the principles of humanity. These actions are taken against an unarmed people fighting for freedom."

    驳斥比诺对苏埃两国的诬蔑
    埃情报司长申明埃及自己管理着运河
    新华社4日讯　开罗消息：埃及情报司长哈特姆10月3日晚发表谈话，指出法国外交部长比诺10月2日在委内瑞拉加拉加斯发表的关于苏伊士运河收归国有的谈话是对埃及的诬蔑运动的一部分。
    哈特姆说：比诺“一直在干着散播谎言的勾当。他说一个苏联官员正在监督着运河的航行工作，但是他的谎言已经被每天由埃及引水员引导的通过运河的大量船只揭穿了。”哈特姆强调说：“埃及是单独管理运河的”。
    哈特姆在谈到比诺所说的埃及采取了侵略行动的说法的时候说：“显然，法国在阿尔及利亚采取的才是这样的行动。这是野兽的行动，是违背人道原则的行动。这种行动是对一个手无寸铁的为自由而斗争的民族采取的。”
