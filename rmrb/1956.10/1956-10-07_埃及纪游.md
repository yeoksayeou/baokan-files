Travels in Egypt
Feng Zhidan

(XVII) At the Aswan Dam

Our steamer continued to sail on the Nile. Southward, further south, the steamer reached the middle reaches of the Nile, about two hundred miles from the Sudanese border, and slowly entered a narrow waterway. A huge black gate blocked our path. We had arrived at the famous Aswan Dam.

This is the Aswan Low Dam, built in 1902. Initially, it could only store 1 billion cubic meters of water. After the expansion in 1912, the storage capacity reached 2.5 billion cubic meters. After another expansion in 1934, the current storage capacity of the dam has reached 5 billion cubic meters. The British built this dam solely to enable Egypt to supply more cotton and other agricultural products.

The torrents of the Nile conceal enormous electrical wealth. More than forty years ago, Egyptians had the ideal of using the Aswan Dam to generate electricity; however, after forty long years, because the British were not interested in developing Egyptian industry, the Egyptians' ideal was never realized. After the birth of the Egyptian Republic, the possibility of turning dreams into reality appeared for Egyptians. The Egyptian government began to build a hydroelectric power station near the dam. We saw there that a hydroelectric power station was under construction, and four tunnels with a diameter of about twelve meters were nearing completion. Egyptian engineers told us that the Nile water would pass through these tunnels, impact the generators, and generate powerful electrical energy. It is estimated that this hydroelectric power station will be able to generate 1.88 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity each year, most of which will be used to supply a fertilizer plant.

Egypt is not satisfied with its current achievements. The population of Egypt has increased from more than 9 million in 1897 to more than 20 million now. Egyptians must seize more land from the desert. However, the Low Dam can only store limited water, and a large amount of Nile water flows away in vain. Therefore, the Egyptians put forward a new plan: they want to build a new dam—the Aswan High Dam—six and a half kilometers south of the current dam.

This is a grand plan. The entire body of the dam, 1,300 meters long and 110 meters high, will lie across the Nile, blocking the river's path and subduing the torrential flow of the Nile under the feet of the Egyptians. Seven tunnels, each about 2,160 meters long, will be carved out of the granite rocks on the east bank of the Nile. If the new dam is completed, an artificial lake six kilometers wide and five hundred kilometers long, capable of storing 130 billion cubic meters of water, will appear on the Nile. A new hydroelectric power station will also be built.

We met many Egyptian engineers at the Aswan Dam, all of whom were confident and capable Egyptians. During our visit to Egypt, Wall Street's agent, World Bank President Black, was in Cairo presenting Egypt with a series of dam loan conditions that would damage Egypt's sovereignty, but Egypt rejected any such conditions. An Egyptian friend said to me: "Let these Americans put forward this or that condition, the Egyptian people will not succumb to the dollar." After we left Egypt, the situation changed, and the American and British colonial countries withdrew their "aid" to Egypt for the construction of the Aswan High Dam, attempting to use this blackmailing tactic to force Egypt to abandon its sovereign interests.

Western imperialist countries originally wanted to prevent Egyptians from using the water of the Nile and stood by to mock the Egyptians. But this ridicule will be in vain. An Egyptian official who accompanied us on the tour said: "In the past, Westerners called our Egypt a country of cattle and horses, and they despised our labor and wisdom; but today they have discovered that we cannot be despised!" Yes, the Egyptians will prove that they can make the Nile bring more happiness and joy to Egypt!

After a fifty-day visit, I bid farewell to Egypt with sincere friendship and respect for the Egyptian people. Not many days after I returned to my beloved motherland, I heard the magnificent voice of the Egyptian people: The Suez Canal belongs to Egypt, and the Egyptian people have the right to manage their own canal. This is a solemn declaration of the Egyptian people to safeguard their sovereignty and independence. I am deeply moved by the heroic fighting spirit of the Egyptian people, and I sincerely congratulate the Egyptian people on their victorious advance in this great struggle! Advance!

    埃及纪游

    （十七）在阿斯旺水坝
    我们的汽船继续行驶在尼罗河上。向南，再向南，汽船到了尼罗河的中游，距离苏丹国境约二百多哩的地方，徐徐地驶入了一个狭窄的水道。一座巨大的黑色闸门挡住了我们的去路。我们已到达著名的阿斯旺水坝了。
    这是阿斯旺低水坝，建于1902年。最初只能储水十亿立方公尺，到1912年扩建后储水量达到二十五亿立方公尺，1934年再行扩建，现在这个水坝的蓄水量已达到五十亿立方公尺了。英国建立这个水坝，仅仅是为了使埃及更多地供应棉花及其它农产品。
    尼罗河的激流蕴藏着巨大的电力财富。四十多年前，埃及人就有过利用阿斯旺水坝发电的理想；可是四十年的漫长的岁月过去了，由于英国人并不对发展埃及的工业发生兴趣，所以埃及人的理想始终没有实现。埃及共和国诞生以后，埃及人把梦想变为现实的可能性出现了。埃及政府在水坝附近开始建立水电站。我们在那里看到，一座水电站正在兴建中，四条直径约十二公尺的隧道快要建成。埃及的工程人员告诉我们，尼罗河的水将要通过这些隧道，冲击发电机，发出强大的电能来。预计这个水电站每年将能发出十八亿八千万瓩时的电力，大部分电力将被用来供应一个肥料厂。
    埃及还不满足于现在的成就。埃及的人口已经从1897年的九百多万增加到现在的二千多万了。埃及人必须向沙漠夺取更多的土地。但是，低水坝只能储蓄有限的水，大量的尼罗河水却白白地流走了。于是，埃及人提出了新的计划，他们要在距现在的水坝以南六公里半的地方建立一个新的水坝——阿斯旺高水坝。
    这是一个宏大的计划。水坝的一千三百公尺长和一百一十公尺高的整个身子将要横躺在尼罗河上，拦住河水的去路，使尼罗河的滔滔流水驯服在埃及人的脚下。在尼罗河东岸的花岗石岩上，将要凿出七条长约二千一百六十公尺的隧道。新坝如果建成，尼罗河上将要出现一个宽六公里、长五百公里，可以蓄水一千三百亿立方公尺的人工湖。一个新的水电站也将建立起来。
    我们在阿斯旺水坝遇到许多埃及的工程人员，他们都是充满着自信的能干的埃及人。在我们访问埃及期间，华尔街的代理人、世界银行行长布莱克正在开罗向埃及提出一系列的有损埃及主权的水坝贷款条件，但是埃及拒绝了任何这类的条件。一位埃及朋友向我说：“让他们这些美国人去提出这个或那个条件来吧，埃及人民是不会在美元面前屈服的。”在我们离开埃及以后，事态有了变化，美英殖民国家撤回了对埃及修建阿斯旺高水坝的“援助”，它们企图用这种要挟的手段来迫使埃及放弃自己的主权利益。
    西方帝国主义国家原想阻止埃及人利用尼罗河的水，并站在一旁嘲笑埃及人。可是这种嘲笑是要落空的。一个陪同我们去参观的埃及官员说：“过去，西方人把我们埃及称为牛马之国，他们轻视我们的劳动和智慧；但今天他们已发现，我们是不能被轻视的！”是的，埃及人将要证明，他们能够使尼罗河为埃及带来更多的幸福和欢乐！
    在五十天的访问以后，我怀着对埃及人民真挚的友情和敬意告别了埃及。在我回到自己亲爱的祖国不多几天，就听到埃及人民发出的壮丽的声音：苏伊士运河是埃及的，埃及人民有权管理属于自己的运河。这是埃及人民维护自己主权和独立的庄严的宣告。我深深为埃及人民英勇的斗争精神所感动，并衷心地祝贺埃及人民在这个伟大的斗争中胜利前进！前进！
