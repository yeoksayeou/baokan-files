    Record of the First Exhibition of the China Pavilion in Vienna
    Zi Zhongyun
    On the first Sunday of September, the windy and rainy Vienna suddenly cleared up. The usually quiet "Rotunde" square, along the tree-lined avenues in the suburbs of Vienna, was bustling with activity. The Vienna International Fair, a grand event held twice a year in spring and autumn, opened. This fair has a history of thirty-five years, and this year, what particularly excites the Viennese is the first appearance of the People's Republic of China Pavilion.
    Before even entering the venue, people could see the five-star red flag fluttering among the colorful national flags of various countries at the entrance. Inside the venue, the international pavilion section displayed the diverse natural resources of various countries, along with various exhibits reflecting the wisdom of the working people and the distinct cultural traditions of each nation. Here, one could not only appreciate the superiority of the socialist system and the thriving lives of the people from the astonishing scale of construction and the comprehensive and rapid advancement of productivity in the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, but also see some new industrial and technological achievements of individual capitalist countries.
    The overall impression gained from this diverse world is an atmosphere of peaceful competition. As the "People's Voice" pointed out: the motto of this year's fair is "coexistence." China's participation in the exhibition this year has made a new contribution to Vienna's role as a bridge for trade between Eastern and Western Europe, in connecting trade between East and West.
    As for the China Pavilion, it can truly be said that throughout the exhibition period, Vienna was a city where everyone was vying to visit the China Pavilion. From the opening to the closing of the exhibition each day, the number of visitors inside the pavilion consistently reached the saturation point. The first day of the opening was a Sunday, and the weather was good, so it was particularly crowded. However, in the following days, despite the sudden cold weather and rain, many people still waited at the door before the opening, and some were reluctant to leave at closing time. Some visitors even came every day. A woman in her sixties came all the way from the other side of the city specifically to see the China Pavilion. Upon arrival, she hurried to the reception room of the Chinese delegation and excitedly called her husband, saying, "Guess where I am now? I'm at the China Pavilion!"
      The various exhibits in the China Pavilion were loved by the visitors. Every day, many people inquired about how to buy the exhibits, and some specifically asked for a cup of Chinese tea or a glass of Chinese wine. A housewife even wrote a letter from a county town, enclosing money, requesting to buy Chinese tea. The Chinese delegation returned the money and sent a package of jasmine tea, and then received an enthusiastic letter from her, describing how this event had become a popular story in their small county. ... There are endless vivid examples like this. Many praises were written in the visitor's book, and some even wrote passionate long poems. If China's traditional specialties and world-renowned handicrafts made the audience rave, the achievements of the new China's industrial construction were even more astonishing to the visitors. The fact that China can manufacture its own machines and has a fully automated seamless steel pipe plant is unimaginable to many Western Europeans. Some even asked, "Is this made in China?" Upon leaving, they were still saying, "Machines! Machines!"
    During the exhibition period, the China Pavilion naturally became one of the centers of newspaper opinion. Austrian newspapers of all parties and official newspapers reported on the grand occasion of the China Pavilion exhibition in different ways. In many newspapers, the words "People's Republic of China" appeared for the first time, replacing the words "Red China."
    The reception held by the Chinese Exhibition Delegation in Vienna for people from all walks of life was also a great success, with more than 1,100 guests, including important government officials and social celebrities. Important figures in the Austrian financial and business circles also attended, and some came to Vienna specifically from other places to participate in the grand event. Many business giants with gray hair and beards reversed the usual practice of sending agents to attend banquets, and came in person. Many foreign diplomatic envoys stationed in Vienna, including those from countries that have not established diplomatic relations with our country, were also invited to attend. The Portuguese Minister made a special effort to find Ji Chaoding, the head of the Chinese Exhibition Delegation, to express his friendly greetings. Many Viennese mentioned that this reception was a rare grand event since the war.
    Although there are no diplomatic relations between China and Austria, this exhibition of the China Pavilion was not only welcomed and loved by the vast majority of the Austrian people, but also attracted the attention of the government authorities. The Chancellor of the Republic of Austria received the head of the Chinese Exhibition Delegation, and the Vice Chancellor and important officials of various government departments visited the China Pavilion.
    The Austrian business community warmly received the Chinese Exhibition Delegation. The Association of Industrialists, composed of Austrian industrial giants, specially hosted a banquet for the Chinese Exhibition Delegation. Long before the opening of the fair, when some members of the Chinese Exhibition Delegation arrived in Vienna, many well-informed business units came one after another, requesting to discuss trade. During the opening of the fair, they were even more overwhelmed, and many manufacturers and importers and exporters scrambled to introduce their products to the Exhibition Delegation or request to sell Chinese specialties on their behalf. This eagerness of the Austrian business community to trade with China is not difficult to understand. Among European countries, Austria is also one of the countries that has suffered from the US "blockade and embargo" policy. It was only more than two months ago that the Austrian business community sent its first delegation to China. The trade contract signed by this delegation with our country was the first direct trade between China and Austria. But the Austrian business community knows very well what developing trade with China will mean for them. In the past, some people mistakenly believed the "advice" of "friends" from some other Western countries, telling them not to do business with "Red" China, so as not to suffer losses. And now, they are beginning to understand that the motive of this "advice" is only to have one less competitor in trade with China.
    In addition, the Chinese Exhibition Delegation received enthusiastic assistance from all aspects during its stay in Vienna. The fair authorities gave great support to the China Pavilion. All members of the business delegation who had just returned from a visit to China warmly helped the Chinese delegation, who were visiting Austria for the first time, as old friends. In the construction of the exhibition hall, the Austrian workers and engineers worked actively to complete the task ahead of schedule. After the closing of the fair, the Chinese Exhibition Delegation also visited many factories at the invitation of many business owners. This support for the Chinese Exhibition Delegation and friendship for the Chinese people, expressed in different ways, is unforgettable.
    Of course, all this is just a good start. The friendship between the Chinese and Austrian people and the trade relations between the two countries have a long way to go.

    记中国馆首次在维也纳展出
    资中筠
    9月里的第一个星期日，多风雨的维也纳天气忽然晴朗起来，一向幽静的维也纳近郊林荫道旁的“罗顿特”广场也人声鼎沸，维也纳每年春秋两度的盛事：国际博览会开幕了。这个博览会已经有三十五年的历史，而今年，特别令维也纳人兴奋的是，第一次出现了中华人民共和国馆。
    人们还没有走进会场，就遥望着五星红旗在大门口彩色缤纷的各国国旗中飘扬。会场里国际馆部分陈列着各个国家不同的自然资源，体现出各国劳动人民的智慧与各国不同文化传统的各种各样展品。人们在这里除了可以从苏联、中国及各人民民主国家惊人的建设规模和生产力全面的突飞猛进中体会到社会主义制度的优越性和人民生活的欣欣向荣外，还可以看到一些资本主义国家个别的新的工业技术成就。
    从这个形形色色的世界里得到的总的感觉，是和平竞赛的气氛。正如“人民之声报”指出的：今年博览会的格言就是“共处”。今年中国的参加展出，使一向起着沟通东西欧贸易作用的维也纳博览会，在沟通东西方贸易中作出了新的贡献。
    至于说到中国馆，那实在可以说：整个展出期中维也纳是“满城争道中国馆”。每天从开馆到闭馆，馆内观众始终达到饱和点。第一天开馆是星期日，又是好天气，观众特别拥挤，但在以后几天天气骤冷、风雨交加的日子里，依然是每天在开馆前就有许多人等在门口，闭馆时还有些人恋恋不忍离去，有的观众甚至每天都来。有一个六十多岁高龄的老太太特意从城里的另一头赶来，专为看看中国馆。她一到，就匆忙地走到中国代表团接待室里，兴奋地给她丈夫打电话说：“你猜我现在在哪里？我到了中国馆了！”
      中国馆展出的各种展品受到观众的喜爱。每天都有许多人来打听如何可以买到展出的东西，也有人特意来要求喝一杯中国茶，一杯中国酒。还有一位家庭主妇从县城写信来，并附了钱，要求买中国茶。中国代表团把钱退还，并寄去一包茉莉花茶后，接到她一封热情洋溢的信，述说着这件事如何在他们的小县城内传为佳话。……这种生动的例子是说不完的。在观众留言薄上写下了许许多多赞语，甚至有人写下了热情的长诗。假如说中国的传统特产和久享世界声誉的手工艺品使观众赞不绝口的话，新中国的工业建设成就就更使参观的人惊异不止了。中国能自己制造机器，中国有完全自动化的无缝钢管厂，这对许多西欧人说来是不可想像的，有人甚至发问：“这是中国自己造的吗？”出门时还说着：“机器！机器”！
    在展览期中，中国馆自然而然地成为报纸舆论的中心之一。奥地利各党派及官方的报纸都以不同方式报道中国馆展出的盛况。在许多报纸上，“中华人民共和国”的字样第一次代替了“红色中国”的字样而出现。
    中国展览团在维也纳举行的各界人士招待会也是极一时之盛，共有一千一百多位宾客，其中有政府重要官员和社会名流。奥地利金融界和企业界的重要人物差不多也都赴会了，有些人是特意从外地赶到维也纳来参加盛会的，有许多已经须发皆白的企业界巨子一反往日派代理人出席宴会的惯例，亲自来参加。许多外国驻维也纳的外交使节，包括与我国没有建交的国家也应邀赴会。葡萄牙公使特意找到中国展览团团长冀朝鼎表示友好的致意。许多维也纳人提起这个招待会都说是战后少有的盛会。
    尽管中奥两国还没有外交关系，这次中国馆的展出不仅受到了奥地利广大人民的欢迎与喜爱，而且引起了政府当局的重视。奥地利共和国的总理接见了中国展览团团长，副总理和政府各部的重要官员都参观了中国馆。
    奥地利的工商界更是热烈地接待了中国展览团。由奥地利工业界巨头组成的工业家协会特别宴请了中国展览团。在博览会开幕前许久，中国展览团一部分团员先到维也纳时，许多消息灵通的企业单位就闻声而至，要求谈贸易。在博览会开幕期间，更是应接不暇，很多厂家和进出口商都争先恐后地向展览团介绍他们的产品或要求代卖中国的特产。奥地利工商界这种急切要求和中国贸易的心情是不难理解的。在欧洲国家中，奥地利也是遭到美国“封锁禁运”政策之害的一个国家。奥地利工商界派第一个代表团到中国去还是两个多月以前的事，这个代表团和我国签定的贸易合同，还是中奥直接成交的第一笔贸易。但是奥地利的工商界知道得很清楚：开展与中国的贸易对他们说来将意味着什么。过去也有人误信过一些其他西方国家的“朋友”的“忠告”，叫他们不要和“红色”中国做生意，以免吃亏。而现在，他们也开始明白，这种“忠告”的动机只是为了在和中国贸易上少一个竞争者而已。
    此外，中国展览团在维也纳期间得到了来自各方面的热情协助。博览会当局对中国馆给予了很大的支持。刚从中国访问回来的工商界代表团全体团员都以老朋友的身份热心地帮助第一次来奥的中国代表团。在展览馆的建馆工作上，更是由于奥地利工人和工程师们的积极努力，提前完成了任务。博览会闭幕后，中国展览团还应许多企业主的邀请参观了许多工厂。这种以不同方式所表现的对中国展览团的支持和对中国人民的友谊是令人难忘的。
    当然，这一切还只是良好的开端，中奥两国人民的友谊，两国之间的贸易关系还正是来日方长。
