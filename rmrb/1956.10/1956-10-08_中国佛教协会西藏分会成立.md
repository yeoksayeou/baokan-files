Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 7th -- The inaugural meeting of the Tibetan Branch of the Buddhist Association of China began on the 6th in Lhasa, the center of Tibetan Lamaism. The Dalai Lama attended the meeting on the 6th. The meeting announced the formal establishment of the Tibetan Branch of the Buddhist Association of China on the 6th.

In front of the Lhasa Grand Auditorium, south of the Potala Palace, a Lama honor guard holding Buddhist banners and instruments, and representatives of various sects holding red Tibetan incense, warmly welcomed the Dalai Lama into the venue. More than 700 representatives, attendees, and observers attended the meeting, including living Buddhas, Khenpos, Khensurs, Shamis, Bhikkhus, and nuns from the Gelug, Nyingma, Sakya, Kagyu, and Bon sects, as well as major monasteries in Tibet, the Upper Tantric College, the Lower Tantric College, and the Translation Bureau. Representatives of Islam in Lhasa also attended the meeting on the 6th to offer congratulations.

The meeting was held according to the most solemn religious rituals. On the stage hung the oldest known thangka of Mamo Tseringma, as well as portraits of Chairman Mao, the Dalai Lama, and the Panchen Erdeni. Below the giant portraits were offerings such as butter lamps, highland barley, and butter sculptures. Huge Buddhist banners and colored portraits of Sakyamuni Buddha, Amitabha Buddha, Avalokiteśvara with Four Arms, Medicine Buddha, Tsongkhapa, and the Sixteen Arhats were also hung on the stage and the walls of the venue. The yellow thrones of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni were placed in the center of the stage. When the Dalai Lama and Fan Ming, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, Li Jue, Deputy Commander of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, and others who came to offer congratulations, ascended the stage, Buddhist music resounded throughout the venue, played by the lamas of the Langji Zhacang of the Potala Palace.

Then, the religious ritual of offering "Mandala" to the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni began, at which time the representatives attending the meeting chanted the "Leden Kachö" scripture, and the Ganden Tripa, the successor of Tsongkhapa, presented offerings. Sokang Wangqing Gelle, a Kalon of the Tibetan local government, also offered "Mandala" and khatas. They also prostrated before the Buddha's throne.

The Dalai Lama spoke at the meeting on the 6th, and his speech was often interrupted by enthusiastic applause.

Because he was in Xigaze, the Panchen Erdeni did not personally attend the meeting, but he sent Living Buddha Dingjie as his representative, who spoke on his behalf at the meeting on the 6th.

Chijiang Losang Yexie, Director of the Religious Affairs Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Dalai Lama's deputy tutor, spoke first at the meeting, saying: After the establishment of the Buddhist Association of China, today the Tibetan Branch of the Buddhist Association of China is also established. This is the shining of the light of the ethnic policies of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao on Tibet, and it is a great manifestation of freedom of religious belief. Living Buddha Chijiang said: Buddhism in China, especially Buddhism in Tibet, has a very long history, and actions like today's have never happened before. Not only that, but our Buddhist culture and excellent system are constantly and gradually progressing forward. This is something we can never forget in our hearts. He said that since the liberation of Tibet, Tibetan Buddhism has been protected, and in the future, we Buddhists will continue to receive the long-term protection and assistance of the Central Government.

At the meeting on the 6th, the inaugural meeting of the Tibetan Branch of the Buddhist Association of China accepted congratulatory banners presented by the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the CPC Tibet Working Committee, and the Tibet Military Region. At this time, Buddhist music was played again in the venue. At the meeting on the 6th, congratulatory messages from the Buddhist Association of China and the Panchen Erdeni were also read.

    中国佛教协会西藏分会成立
    新华社拉萨7日电　中国佛教协会西藏分会成立会议6日在西藏喇嘛教中心——拉萨开始举行。达赖喇嘛出席了6日的会议。会议宣布中国佛教协会西藏分会在6日正式成立。
    在布达拉宫南面的拉萨大礼堂前，手举佛幡佛器的喇嘛仪仗队和捧着红藏香的各教派代表，热烈欢迎达赖喇嘛进入会场。出席这个会议的代表和列席、旁听的共有七百多人，他们包括格鲁巴、宁玛、萨迦、噶居、奔波等教派和西藏各大寺院、上密宗院、下密宗院、译仓的活佛、堪布、堪苏、沙弥、比丘和尼姑。拉萨的伊斯兰教代表6日也到会祝贺。
    这个会议是按照最隆重的宗教仪式举行的。在主席台上挂着相传年代最早的麻墨则佛的佛像和毛主席、达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼的像。在巨像下面摆着酥油灯、青稞和酥油花等供品。在主席台和会场的壁上，还挂着巨大的佛幡和释迦牟尼佛、无量光佛、四壁观音、药王佛、宗喀巴和十六尊者的彩色画像。达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的黄色佛座设在主席台的正中央。当达赖喇嘛和前来祝贺的中共西藏工委副书记范明、人民解放军西藏军区副司令员李觉等人走上主席台时，会场里响起了佛乐声，这是由布达拉宫朗吉扎仓的喇嘛们所奏的。
    接着，开始举行向达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼献“曼陀罗”的宗教仪式，这时参加会议的代表念起“勒登卡却”经，由宗喀巴继承人噶丹赤巴献供品。西藏地方政府噶伦索康·旺清格来也奉献了“满扎”和哈达。他们还向佛座进行了朝拜。
    达赖喇嘛在6日的会上讲了话，他的讲话时常为热烈的掌声打断。
    班禅额尔德尼因为在日喀则，没有亲自参加这个会议，他派了定杰活佛为代表，代表他在6日的会议上讲了话。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会宗教事务委员会主任、达赖喇嘛副经师赤江·罗桑益西首先在会上讲话，他说：中国佛教协会成立后，今天中国佛教协会西藏分会又成立，这是中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的民族政策的光明照耀着西藏，是信教自由的伟大表现。赤江活佛说：中国有佛教，特别是西藏的佛教，已经有很长的历史了，像今天这样的举动，还是从前没有过的。不仅这样，我们佛教的文化，很好的制度，不断地逐渐在往前进步。这是我们心里永远不能忘的。他说，自从西藏解放以来，西藏佛教受到了保护，以后我们佛教徒还将长期受到中央的保护和帮助。
    在6日的会议上，中国佛教协会西藏分会成立会议接受了中华人民共和国民族事务委员会、西藏自治区筹备委员会、中共西藏工委、西藏军区赠送的贺幛。这时会场上再一次奏起佛乐。6日的会议上，还宣读了中国佛教协会和班禅额尔德尼的贺电。
