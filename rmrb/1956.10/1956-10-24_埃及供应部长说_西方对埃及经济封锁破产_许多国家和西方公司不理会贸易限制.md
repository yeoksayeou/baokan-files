Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 23rd: Egyptian Supply Minister Stino said at a press conference on October 22nd that the Western economic blockade against Egypt has failed. Some companies in Western countries are currently trading with Egypt despite the restrictions imposed by their governments.

Stino said that many countries have now proposed that they can supply Egypt with various goods and materials without any restrictions, even those that existed before the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company.

He said that some companies in the United States, Britain, and France have proposed to export goods to Egypt in exchange for cotton or with Egyptian pound deposits that have been frozen.

Stino revealed that although some Western countries are imposing an economic blockade on Egypt, Germany, Italy, and Czechoslovakia are exporting cars and car parts to Egypt. At the same time, American company cars are still being shipped to this country through Kuwait.

He said that several Swiss companies have offered to supply Egypt with goods based on long-term extended payment terms.

Stino said that Egypt is using 80% flour and 20% potatoes to make bread. This can save 300,000 tons of wheat annually.

The Ministry of Finance announced that in the past five weeks, Egypt's convertible currency holdings have increased by the equivalent of 7.5 million Egyptian pounds.

The "People's Daily" said on October 22nd that the Western economic blockade against Egypt "aims to bring the Egyptian people to the brink of starvation," but "day after day, month after month, has passed without any serious incidents occurring."

    埃及供应部长说
    西方对埃及经济封锁破产
    许多国家和西方公司不理会贸易限制
    新华社23日讯　开罗消息：埃及供应部部长斯蒂诺10月22日在记者招待会上说，西方对埃及的经济封锁已经破产。西方国家的一些公司目前正在不顾它们政府所强加的限制同埃及进行贸易。
    斯蒂诺说：现在许多国家已经提出，可以不受任何限制，供应埃及各种货物和物资，甚至不受那些苏伊士运河公司国有化以前就存在的限制。
    他说，美国、英国和法国的一些公司提出可以用棉花实物支付的办法，或是用埃及被冻结的英镑存款支付的办法，向埃及输出货物。
    斯蒂诺透露，虽然一些西方国家对埃及进行经济封锁，德国、意大利和捷克斯洛伐克正在向埃及输出汽车和汽车零件。同时，美国公司的汽车现在仍然通过科威特运到这个国家。
    他说，若干瑞士公司已经提出愿意根据长期宽限的付款条件供应埃及货物。
    斯蒂诺说，埃及正在用80％的面粉和20％的马铃薯制造面包。这样做每年可以节约三十万吨小麦。
    财政部宣布，在过去五周，埃及拥有的可兑换货币已经增加了相当于七百五十万埃及镑的数目。
      “人民报”10月22日说，西方对埃及的经济封锁“目的在于要把埃及人民带到饥饿的边沿”，但是，“日复一日，月复一月地过去了，并没有发生任何严重的事件。”
