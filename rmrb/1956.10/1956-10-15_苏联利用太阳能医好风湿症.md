    苏联利用太阳能医好风湿症
    新华社莫斯科14日电　苏联一些地区的医疗机构用太阳光反射器聚集的太阳能来治疗风湿症等病，已经获得成效。
    “苏维埃俄罗斯报”介绍了几个治好的病人的情况。阿拉木图一个叫斯特拉霍娃的家庭主妇，十六年以前得了一种严重的风湿症，以后又害了伤寒，以致半身不遂，每年都有七、八个月躺卧在病床上。后来她到这里的一个医院用太阳光反射器治疗，病才好转了。
    阿拉木图的这个太阳光反射器已经安装有好多年，它曾经帮助许多病人治疗好了心脏神经病、重感冒和肺炎等疾病。在基辅的一家病院里，也已经建立了这样的反射器，收效也良好。
    苏联卫生部已经确认了这种利用太阳能的反射器的治疗效能。现在，在乌克兰、“斯维德洛夫”和“莫洛托夫”等地，都建立有这种太阳光反射器。
