Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Rural sideline production in Fujian Province has recently experienced vigorous development. The market supply of sideline products such as charcoal, handmade paper, vegetables, thatch, bricks, tiles, chickens, ducks, and rabbits has now significantly increased in various regions. In the nine counties of the Jinjiang Special District, more than 110,000 pigs have been additionally raised from late August to early October. Small-scale local specialties that were neglected in the past, such as various medicinal materials, alkali soil, and bamboo leaves, are now also being developed as production projects to meet market needs. The tight supply situation for many sideline products has begun to ease.

The recovery and development of sideline production in various regions has generally increased farmers' incomes. From January to September this year, farmers in the Nanping Special District earned more than 63 million yuan from sideline occupations, equivalent to 84% of the total sideline income for the entire year last year. According to statistics from eight counties in the Fuan Special District in August, farmers' sideline income had reached more than 2.36 million yuan, which is approximately equal to the total sideline income of farmers in the entire special district from January to May last year. After developing sideline production in Datian County in the Jinjiang Special District, agricultural cooperatives can generally achieve income increases for more than 90% of their members.

    福建农村副业蓬勃发展
    新华社讯　福建省农村副业生产最近有了蓬勃发展。各地木炭、土纸、蔬菜、茅草、砖瓦、鸡、鸭、兔等副业产品的上市量，现在都显著增加。晋江专区九个县从8月下旬到10月上旬增养的猪有十一万多头。过去被忽视的小宗土特产，如各种药材、土碱、竹叶等，现在也都作为生产项目，供应市场需要。不少副业产品的供应紧张状态，已经趋向缓和。
    各地副业生产的恢复和发展，使农民收入普遍有所增加。南平专区农民今年1月到9月的副业收入达六千三百多万元，等于去年全年副业收入的84％。福安专区据八个县在8月份的统计，农民副业收入已经达到两百三十六万多元，约等于去年1月到5月全专区农民的副业收入。晋江专区的大田县在发展副业生产以后，农业社普遍可以达到90％以上的社员增加收入。
