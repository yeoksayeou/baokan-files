Xinhua News Agency Report: Nanjing recently held the Jiangsu Province Nurses' Representative Meeting to discuss the issue of improving nursing work. The meeting was attended by one hundred and sixteen representatives, representing more than five thousand nursing workers throughout the province.

During the meeting, the representatives criticized phenomena such as the improper use and arrangement of nurses by relevant departments, the lack of leadership in nursing work, chaotic organizational structure, and insufficient attention to nurses' welfare. For example, the Xuzhou First People's Hospital transferred an experienced veteran nurse to work in the library. Nurses at the Changshu People's Hospital have long lacked places for rest and study. The representatives also raised concerns about the current lack of advanced nursing education and the insufficient number of students and teachers in secondary nursing schools.

Many representatives believed that nursing work is a scientific and technical endeavor and an important component of medical science. Nurses should develop towards nursing specialization. The use and arrangement of nurses should ensure that knowledge is applied. Nursing education should not be limited to the secondary level; nursing colleges (including advanced refresher courses) should be established. The representatives also mentioned that relevant health departments should strengthen leadership in nursing work, larger hospitals should restore nursing departments, the number of nurses should be appropriately increased, and working conditions should be improved, giving nurses time to study professional skills and improve the quality of nursing.

    江苏省召开护士代表会议研究护理工作问题
    新华社讯　南京最近举行江苏省护士代表会，讨论了改进护士工作的问题。出席会议的有代表着全省五千多名护理工作者的一百一十六位代表。
    在会议期间，代表们对有关部门使用和安排护士不当，对护理工作缺乏领导，组织编制混乱，对护士的生活福利照顾不够等现象提出了批评。如徐州市第一医院把一个富有经验的老护士调到图书室工作。常熟市人民医院护士长期没有休息和学习的地方。代表们对现在没有高级的护理教育、中级护士学校学生和师资来源不足等情况也提出了意见。
    许多代表认为，护理工作是一种科学技术工作，是医学科学的重要组成部分。护士要向护理专业发展。对护士的使用和安排要做到学以致用。护理教育不应限于中级，要创办护理高等学校（包括高级进修）。代表们还提到有关卫生部门应加强对护士工作的领导，较大的医院应恢复护理部，适当增加护士编制，改善工作条件，使护士有钻研业务技术的时间，提高护理质量。
