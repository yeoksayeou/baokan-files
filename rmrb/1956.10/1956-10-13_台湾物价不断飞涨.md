    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 12th: Taiwan newspapers report that commodity prices in Taiwan have recently broken the relatively stable situation of the past six months and are rising again. Among them, the prices of people's daily necessities such as rice, miscellaneous grains, oil, and sugar have risen most sharply. Due to the fierce rise in the prices of all goods, the Taiwan market is currently quite chaotic, and people's lives are becoming increasingly difficult.
    According to wholesale prices in Taipei published by Taiwan newspapers, in the last week of September, the prices of grain, oil, and sugar in Taipei generally rose by 9% to 11.5%. Ponlai brown rice in central Taiwan rose from 165 yuan (Taiwan dollars, the price per 60 kilograms, same below) to 181 yuan, and zailai white rice rose from 174 yuan to 192 yuan; soybeans rose from 330 yuan to 390 yuan. The prices of gauze, hardware, building materials, and groceries have also generally soared.

    台湾物价不断飞涨
    据新华社12日讯　台湾报纸消息：台湾物价最近打破半年来比较平稳的局面，又再度不断飞涨，其中尤以米、杂粮、油、糖等人民生活必需品涨势最为激烈。由于百物涨势凶猛，目前台湾市场相当混乱，人民生活倍加困难。
    据台湾报纸发表的台北市批发价，在9月份的最后一个星期内，台北市粮食、油、糖普遍上涨了9％到11.5％。台湾中部蓬莱糙米由一百六十五元（台币，每六十公斤价格，下同）涨至一百八十一元，在来白米由一百七十四元涨至一百九十二元；黄豆由三百三十元涨至三百九十元。纱布、五金、建筑材料、杂货的价格也都普遍飞涨。
