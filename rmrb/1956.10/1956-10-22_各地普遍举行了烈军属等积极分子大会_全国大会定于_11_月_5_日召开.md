Xinhua News Agency, October 20th: Since July of this year, all provinces (autonomous regions) and municipalities directly under the central government across the country, with the exception of Hebei Province, have universally convened activist conferences for families of martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers who are active in socialist construction. A total of 11,179 socialist construction activists who have emerged from various positions attended the local conferences. At the local conferences, 622 representatives were also elected to participate in the National Activist Conference for Families of Martyrs, Families of Soldiers, Disabled Veterans, and Demobilized Soldiers in Socialist Construction.

Among the representatives attending the local activist conferences, many were outstanding figures who emerged during the high tide of socialist construction and socialist transformation. Cui Changjiu, a model family member of a soldier from Liaoning Province, a special-class model worker from Anshan City, and the deputy director of the Anshan Riveting and Forging Factory, has created three types of machines, including a winch-operated hammer iron-breaking machine, over the past few years, and has put forward many rationalization proposals, creating a large amount of wealth for the country. Tong Jindi, the leader of the stonemason youth shock brigade of the Southwest Third Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering and a demobilized soldier from Yunnan Province, led his team to successfully complete more than 70 tasks. In the first half of this year, he exceeded the quota in all sixteen major and minor projects, completing the tasks 1,400 working days ahead of schedule.

Among the representatives attending the local conferences, many were old Red Army soldiers and family members of Red Army martyrs from the Second Domestic Revolutionary War period. Pu Yunde and Yang Haishan, soldiers of the 28th Regiment of the 10th Division of the Red Fourth Front Army who had participated in the Long March, participated in the Sichuan Province activist conference together this time. Pu Yunde is now the director of an agricultural production cooperative, and Yang Haishan once served as the director of the Naxi Winery. This winery saved more than 67,000 catties of grain for the country in less than a year and was rated as the second most advanced factory in southern Sichuan. Zhang Quanming, an old Red Army soldier who is now sixty-one years old and has been a party member for twenty-two years, participated in the Long March, the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. For more than twenty years, he has made arduous efforts for the cause of the Party. After returning to his hometown of Longshan County, Hunan Province, he actively led the masses to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation and to build water conservancy projects and develop production. Wang Yuexiang, a family member of a Red Army martyr and an old Communist Party member from Tangshi Township, Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province, served as the head of the women's team responsible for delivering grain to the Red Army during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War. After liberation, she actively led the masses to organize mutual aid teams and cooperatives. Because of her conscientious work and love for the community, she is known as "Glorious Mother."

Among the representatives attending the local conferences were also Peng Laotaitai, the mother of revolutionary martyr Peng Pai, Yang Laotaitai, the mother of Yang Yin, and other famous families of martyrs and soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, October 19th: The National Activist Conference for Families of Martyrs, Families of Soldiers, Disabled Veterans, and Demobilized Soldiers in Socialist Construction will be held in Beijing on November 5th.

The preparatory committee for this activist conference was established today and held its first meeting.
