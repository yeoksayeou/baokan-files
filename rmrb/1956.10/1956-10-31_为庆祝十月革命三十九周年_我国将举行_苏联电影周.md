Xinhua News Agency, October 30th. To celebrate the 39th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, the Ministry of Culture and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have decided to hold a "Soviet Film Week" starting November 7th.

Soviet filmmakers have organized a delegation to come to China to participate in the "Soviet Film Week" activities. The delegation is headed by Kalashnikov, Deputy Director of the General Administration of Film Production of the Soviet Ministry of Culture. The members include Rukov, Honored Artist of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic and film director, film director Rostotsky, People's Artist of the Soviet Union Maretskaya, Honored Artist of the Russian Socialist Republic Gritsenko, film actors Mordyukova, Pannich, and Smirnov, editor of the Soviet Culture Newspaper.

The films to be screened during the "Soviet Film Week" include four feature films: "Mother," "An Unfinished Story," "Ivan's Childhood" and "The Bad Son-in-Law."

"Mother" is adapted from Gorky's novel of the same name, depicting the process of a Russian woman who has suffered oppression, poverty, and pain growing into a proletarian fighter, reflecting the workers' movement before and after the first Russian revolution in 1905. "An Unfinished Story" movingly portrays the selfless work and lofty emotions of a female doctor. "Ivan's Childhood" uses a comedic form to describe how a "good-for-nothing" young man is trained into an excellent soldier in the Soviet army. "The Bad Son-in-Law" reflects the conflict between advanced and backward thinking in a Soviet collective farm through a family dispute.

"Soviet Film Week" will be held successively in twenty cities. The ten cities where it will be held starting November 7th are Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Harbin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Urumqi. The ten cities where it will be held starting in mid-November are Taiyuan, Jinan, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Dalian, Anshan, Changchun, Changsha, Chengdu, and Lanzhou.

    为庆祝十月革命三十九周年
    我国将举行“苏联电影周”
    新华社30日讯　为了庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十九周年，文化部和中苏友好协会总会决定从11月7日起举行“苏联电影周”。
    苏联电影工作者已组织了一个代表团，将来我国参加“苏联电影周”的活动。代表团由苏联文化部影片生产总管理局副局长卡拉什尼科夫任团长。团员有乌兹别克人民共和国功勋艺术家、电影导演鲁柯夫，电影导演罗斯托茨基，苏联人民演员玛列茨卡娅，俄罗斯社会主义共和国功勋演员格里岑珂，电影演员莫尔久阔娃、潘尼奇和苏联文化报编辑斯密尔诺夫等人。
    参加“苏联电影周”放映的有四部故事片：“母亲”、“没有说完的故事”、“伊凡从军记”和“不称心的女婿”。
      “母亲”根据高尔基的同名小说改编，描写一个受尽压迫、贫困和痛苦的俄罗斯妇女成长为无产阶级战士的过程，反映了1905年俄国第一次革命前后的工人运动。“没有说完的故事”动人地表现了一位女医生的忘我劳动和她的崇高感情。“伊凡从军记”以喜剧的形式，描写了一个“没出息”的小伙子，怎样在苏联军队里锻炼成优秀的战士。“不称心的女婿”通过一个家庭的纠纷，反映了苏联集体农庄中先进和落后思想的冲突。
    “苏联电影周”将先后在二十个城市举行。从11月7日起举行的，有北京、天津、上海、沈阳、哈尔滨、武汉、广州、重庆、西安、乌鲁木齐十个城市。从11月中旬起举行的，有太原、济南、南京、杭州、旅大、鞍山、长春、长沙、成都、兰州十个城市。
