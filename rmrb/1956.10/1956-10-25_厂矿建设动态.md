Factory and Mine Construction Updates

    Shanghai to Build Modern Watch Factory
    Shanghai will begin construction on a modern watch manufacturing factory in early next year. Specific designs for the factory's technical plans and building structures are already being drafted at the Watch Trial-Manufacturing Factory and the East China Engineering and Construction Institute.
    The planned location for this watch factory is near the Hongqiao Road West Suburb Park, covering an area of over 100 mu. To prevent vibrations from passing vehicles, falling objects, etc., from affecting watch manufacturing, deep and wide ditches will be dug around the factory. A large number of flowers, plants, and trees will be planted to maintain air cleanliness and prevent dust intrusion. According to the factory building design requirements, many workshop windows will be fitted with double-layer glass for insulation and dust prevention. In hot summers and cold winters, special automatic temperature control equipment will be installed to absorb turbid air and release filtered air, preventing the human body's heat dissipation and people's entry and exit from increasing or decreasing the indoor temperature. The vibration-free and soundproofed finished product inspection room requires that no objects that could vibrate or make noise be placed within several zhang (丈, a traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.33 meters); even the ringing of a telephone bell more than a dozen storefronts away could disrupt the second-hand inspection of watches.
    After starting operations, the new watch factory will be able to produce three hundred to five hundred watches every eight hours. According to the factory's plan, precision aircraft watches will also be produced in 1958.

    Turning High-Voltage Electricity into Low-Voltage Electricity
    An important project of the Zhengzhou-Luoyang-Sanmenxia power grid – the civil construction of the Luoyang Substation – has recently been completed. Standing at the Luoyang Thermal Power Plant construction site and looking northwest, a flat-topped building not far away is the main control room of the substation. The road leading to the substation has begun construction, and the concrete foundations for placing the transformers have also been laid, and electrical equipment will soon be installed.
    After the completion of the entire substation project, it can convert the 110,000-volt high-voltage electricity from Zhengzhou into low-voltage electricity suitable for production needs.

    Hebei Builds New Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory
    A cotton textile printing and dyeing joint factory with more than 567,000 spindles, more than 10,000 looms, and an annual output of 6 million bolts of printing and dyeing equipment is being accelerated in Handan City, a cotton-producing area of Hebei Province.
    This factory consists of three spinning mills, three weaving mills, and one printing and dyeing mill. Currently, two spinning mills and one weaving mill have officially started construction. The factory building of one of the spinning mills has been roofed, and machines will soon be installed; the factory building of another spinning mill is also nearing completion.
    After the factory is completed and put into production, it will not only be able to produce cotton fabrics such as serge, double-sided flannel, linen yarn, gabardine, and poplin, but also print and dye various patterned and colored fabrics. The cotton yarn it produces in one year can be woven into fabric sufficient for more than one-sixth of the country's population to make a new outfit.

    Asbestos Beneficiation Plant Put into Production
    China's first automated asbestos beneficiation plant on the Kangzang Plateau – the Sichuan State-Owned Asbestos Beneficiation Plant – officially put its first set of equipment into production on October 5.
    Shimen County in Sichuan Province has a large asbestos reserve, ranking first in the country. The establishment of such a factory is of great significance for developing the economy of remote areas and rationally utilizing resources.
    This factory was designed with the help of Czechoslovak experts. The entire production process, from drying, crushing, screening to finished product, is automated, requiring only nine workers to manage; and the daily production volume is more than that of a manual selection plant with more than 220 people in the past.
    Currently, the second set of equipment is being installed.

    Metal Structure Factory Under Construction in Wuhan
    A metal structure factory using mechanized production – the State-Owned Wuhan Metal Structure Factory – has recently started construction in Wuhan City.
    This factory is being built near the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise plant area. After completion, it will be able to produce more than 30,000 tons of metal structure building components annually. During the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel, it will manufacture metal structure components for Wuhan Iron and Steel; after Wuhan Iron and Steel is completed, this factory will undertake the task of manufacturing metal structure components for other industrial construction units in the Central South region.

    厂矿建设动态
    上海将建现代化手表工厂
    上海将在明年年初动工兴建一个现代化手表制造厂。有关这个厂的技术计划和厂房结构等的具体设计工作，已在手表试制工厂和华东工程建筑院开始编绘。
    这个手表制造厂的厂址准备设在虹桥路西郊公园附近，占地一百余亩。为了防止外界车辆行走、物体落地等震动而影响手表的制造，厂的四周将要挖掘深阔的河沟。厂内要种植大量的花草树木，以保持空气清洁和防止灰尘侵入。根据厂房设计的要求，很多车间的窗子都将装有双层玻璃，保温防尘。在炎热的夏天和严寒的冬天，为了不使人体散发的热量和人的出入而增降室内的温度，还装置特殊的吸收混浊空气、放射过滤空气的自动定温设备。无震隔音的成品检验室，要求在几丈以内，不能装放任何有可能震动和发音的东西，即使距离十几家店面以外的一只电话铃响，也将会打乱手表的秒针检验。
    新建的手表厂，在开工以后，每天八小时能生产三百至五百只手表。根据这个厂的规划，在1958年还将出产精密的飞机用表。
    把高压电流变成低压电流
    郑州—洛阳—三门峡电力网的一项重要工程——洛阳变电所的土木建筑工程，最近已完成。站在洛阳热电厂工地向西北望去，不远的地方有一所平顶的建筑物，那就是变电所的主控制室。通往变电所的公路已开始修筑，安放变压器的混凝土基础也已打好，不久就可以安装变电设备。
    这个变电所工程全部完成以后，可以把来自郑州的十一万伏特高压电流，变成适合生产需要的低压电流。
    河北新建棉纺织印染厂
    一座拥有五十六万七千多枚纱锭、一万多台布机和年产六百万匹印染设备的棉纺织印染联合厂，正在河北省产棉区的邯郸市加速建设。
    这个工厂共由三个纺纱分厂、三个织布分厂和一个印染分厂组成。现在，已有两个纺纱分厂和一个织布分厂正式动工兴建。其中一个纺纱分厂的厂房已经盖上屋顶，不久就要开始安装机器；另一个纺纱分厂的厂房也快要结顶。
    这个工厂全部完工投入生产后，不仅能够生产哔叽、双面绒、麻纱、华达呢、府绸等棉布，并且能够印染各种花布和色布。它一年生产的棉纱织成布，可供全国六分之一以上的人口每人添作一身新衣服。
    石棉精选厂投入生产
    在康藏高原上的我国第一座自动化的石棉精选工厂——四川国营石棉精选厂，它的第一套设备已于10月5日正式投入生产。
    四川石棉县的石棉蕴藏量很大，占全国第一位。建立这样一个工厂，对开发边远地区经济、合理利用资源都有很大的意义。
    这座厂是由捷克斯洛伐克专家帮助设计的。全部生产过程从干燥、粉碎、筛选到制成成品都是自动化，只需九个工人管理；而每日生产量比过去一个二百二十多人的手选厂还多。
    目前，第二套设备正在安装中。
    金属结构工厂在武汉兴建
    一座利用机械化生产的金属结构工厂——国营武汉金属结构厂，最近在武汉市开工兴建。
    这个工厂建筑在武汉钢铁联合企业厂区附近。建成以后，每年能生产三万吨以上的金属结构建筑构件。在武钢建设期间，它将为武钢制造金属结构构件；等武钢建成以后，这个工厂将担负中南地区其他工业建设单位金属结构构件的制造任务。
