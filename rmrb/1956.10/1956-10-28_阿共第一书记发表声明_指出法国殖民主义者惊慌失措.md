Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, October 27th: Comrade Rabi Bouhali, First Secretary of the Algerian Communist Party, who is currently visiting Changchun after attending the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, issued the following statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters today regarding the French kidnapping of five leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front:

    I am extremely angry upon learning of the arrest of five leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front. This act of robbery by the heads of the French colonialists not only demonstrates their panic in the face of our people's heroic struggle for national independence and peace, but also shows their opposition to resolving the Algerian issue through negotiation.
    Furthermore, this act is also a serious threat to peace in the Mediterranean region, and therefore the brotherly peoples of Tunisia and Morocco cannot ignore this issue.
    I am convinced that this event will surely arouse the indignation of all the Algerian people, and it will certainly unite our people more closely and raise the level of the struggle to eliminate the hateful colonial system.
    Similarly, I also believe that on the eve of the United Nations General Assembly, where the Algerian issue should be raised for discussion, this event will also stir up the excitement of all progressive and peace-loving forces around the world, including the French working class and people.

    阿共第一书记发表声明
    指出法国殖民主义者惊慌失措
    新华社长春27日电　在参加中国共产党第八次全国代表大会后现在正在长春市访问的阿尔及利亚共产党第一书记拉比·布哈利同志，今天就法国绑架阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线五位领袖一事，对新华社记者发表声明如下：
    获悉阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线五位领袖被捕的消息后，我感到极为愤怒。法国殖民主义者的头子们的这种强盗行为，不仅说明他们在我国人民为争取民族独立与和平的英勇斗争面前的惊慌失措，同时也说明他们是反对以协商方式解决阿尔及利亚问题的。
    另外，这种行为也是对地中海地区和平的严重威胁，因此突尼斯与摩洛哥兄弟人民对此问题不能置之不理。
    我确信这一事件定将激起全体阿尔及利亚人民的愤慨，它将一定使我国人民更加紧密团结，使为消灭可憎恨的殖民主义制度的斗争水平提高。
    同样，我也相信，在联合国大会召开的前夕，阿尔及利亚问题在这次大会上应将提出讨论，这一事件也将掀起全世界的、包括法国工人阶级与人民的一切进步与和平力量的激动。
