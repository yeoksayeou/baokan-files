Xinhua News Agency, Amsterdam, 7th Dispatch from TASS: At the morning session on October 5th of the 18th Congress of the Dutch Communist Party, Groot, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party, delivered a report on the first item on the agenda: a summary of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Groot first pointed out that the Geneva Conference of the Four Powers held last year, which led to a further easing of international tensions, the formation of the world socialist camp, and the liberation of many countries in Asia and Africa from colonial oppression, were all events of profound significance, and the congress should discuss them. Groot reminded the delegates of the significance of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for further improving the international situation and advancing the communist movement.

He pointed out that the adoption of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the further strengthening of the Leninist policy of peace, the overcoming of the cult of personality, and the formulation of certain theoretical issues of the international workers' movement under new conditions were all extremely important achievements of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

He spoke on some issues of Dutch foreign and domestic policies. He said that the international situation presents the Netherlands with a choice: either to continue to participate in the establishment of military blocs, the arms race, and economic blockades, and the road leading to atomic war; or to choose to end the policy of war and implement peaceful coexistence and economic cooperation with socialist countries.

He continued that there is now a practical possibility to eliminate the American domination of the Netherlands and restore national autonomy. This autonomy can be achieved more quickly if our party can fully realize and convince the broad masses of the working class and other strata of residents that it is necessary to get rid of dependence on the United States, because this is not only a condition for achieving security, but also for improving the living standards of the working people, ensuring employment, and achieving political and social progress.

Groot said that American control is most easily seen in the two aspects of expanding armaments and foreign trade. Militarization is consuming the manpower of the Netherlands in vain, undermining the country's economy, causing inflation, and threatening social security. The policy of restricting trade with socialist camp countries, executed in accordance with American orders, has also harmed the Netherlands.

Groot pointed out that the Indonesian people are successfully carrying out the struggle against the remnants of former Dutch colonial rule.

When discussing the issue of striving for concerted action between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, he said that great flexibility should be shown in uniting all democratic forces in order to establish a left-wing government. He said that in this regard, it is necessary to strive to further strengthen the Marxist-Leninist party of the working class—the Communist Party.

Groot also spoke about the government crisis in the Netherlands, which has not been resolved for a long time, and the failure of the Dutch Socialist Party's attempt to organize a new government. He said that this is because the leader of the Labor Party, Drees, and those who support him are still unwilling to abandon the ineffective anti-communist policy demanded of them by American monopoly capital, and this artificially creates obstacles to the unity of the working class. Groot pointed out that it is impossible to form a left-wing government and implement progressive policies without cooperating with the Communist Party.

Groot called on Communist Party members to continue their efforts to realize the current tasks of the Dutch Communist Party. He mentioned the party's struggle to eliminate the threat of war and strive for the easing of international tensions, and its tireless struggle for bread and freedom, against reactionaries and monopoly capital. Groot finally emphasized: In this arduous struggle, the Dutch Communist Party must advance shoulder to shoulder with the international communist movement and its vanguard—the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—in thought and action.

Xinhua News Agency, Amsterdam, 6th Dispatch from TASS: At the evening session of October 5th and the morning session of October 6th of the 18th Congress of the Dutch Communist Party, the discussion of the reports by Groot and Hoekstra continued. A total of forty people spoke during the discussion of the reports.

At the meeting, speakers talked about various aspects of the party's work and put forward many valuable suggestions and revisions to the draft resolutions of the congress. The discussion was conducted in an atmosphere of full agreement and great enthusiasm.

Hoekstra made a concluding speech on the two reports. The congress also read out congratulatory messages to the congress from the fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties of the following countries, including the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, India, the German Democratic Republic, Norway, Iceland, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Albania, Bulgaria, Denmark, and Romania.

The congress then unanimously adopted the general resolution.

The congress also adopted a resolution agreeing with the position taken by the Central Committee of the Party on the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and expressing its full support for the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on June 30, "On Overcoming the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences."

The Congress entrusted the Central Committee with drafting a draft of the new Party Constitution and submitting it to the next Congress for approval.

Finally, the congress listened to and discussed the report by Bakker, editor of the Dutch "Truth Newspaper," on the work of the Party Central Organ, and adopted a corresponding resolution. According to the report of the Credentials Committee, 336 delegates with voting rights and 75 delegates with speaking rights attended the congress. The closing session of the congress will be held on the evening of the 6th and the 7th, at which a new Central Committee will be elected.

    在荷共第十八次代表大会上
    格鲁特强调加强同一切民主力量的团结
    争取在荷兰建立左翼政府和执行进步政策
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社阿姆斯特丹6日讯：荷兰共产党中央委员会总书记格鲁特在荷兰共产党第十八次代表大会5日上午会议上作了关于第一项议程——苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的总结——的报告。
    格鲁特首先指出，去年举行的导致国际紧张局势进一步缓和的四大国首脑日内瓦会议、世界社会主义阵营的形成、亚洲和非洲许多国家从殖民主义压迫下解放出来等等事件都有着很深刻的意义，大会应当对这些事件加以讨论。格鲁特提醒代表们注意苏联共产党第二十次代表大会对于进一步改善国际局势和推进共产主义运动的意义。
    他指出，第六个五年计划的通过，列宁主义和平政策的进一步加强，个人崇拜的克服以及在新的条件下对国际工人运动的某些理论性问题的提法，都是苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的极其重大的成果。
    他谈到荷兰外交和内政政策方面的一些问题。他说，国际局势使荷兰面临这样的抉择：或者是选择继续参加建立军事集团、扩军备战和经济封锁以及导致原子战争的道路；或者是选择终止战争政策、实行和社会主义国家和平共处和经济合作的道路。
    他继续说，现在有着实际可能来消除美国对荷兰的统治，恢复民族自主。如果我们党能充分认识到，并且能够使广大工人阶级群众和其他阶层居民相信必须摆脱对美国的依赖，因为这不仅是取得安全，而且是提高劳动人民生活水平、保障就业和政治与社会进步的条件；那末这种自主就可以更快地获得。
    格鲁特说，在扩充军备和对外贸易这两方面最容易看出美国的控制。军国主义化白白地消耗掉荷兰的人力，破坏国家的经济，引起通货膨胀和威胁到社会保障。而遵照美国命令执行限制同社会主义阵营国家的贸易的政策也使荷兰受到了损害。
    格鲁特指出，印度尼西亚人民在顺利地进行反对前荷兰殖民主义统治的残余的斗争。
    他在谈到争取共产党和社会党一致行动的问题时说，应当在团结一切民主力量以求建立左翼政府方面表现出极大的灵活性。他说，在这方面，必须争取进一步加强马克思列宁主义的工人阶级政党——共产党。
    格鲁特还谈到荷兰迟迟不能解决的政府危机和荷兰社会党企图组织新政府已告失败这件事。他说，这是由于劳工党领袖德里斯和拥护他的人至今仍旧不愿意放弃美国垄断资本要求他们执行的无效的反共政策，而这一点人为地造成了对工人阶级的团结的障碍。格鲁特指出，不同共产党合作就不可能组成左翼政府和执行进步的政策。
    格鲁特号召共产党员继续努力来实现荷兰共产党当前的任务。他提到党为消灭战争威胁和争取缓和国际紧张局势而进行的斗争，为争取面包和自由、反对反动派和垄断资本而进行的不倦的斗争。格鲁特最后强调：在这个艰巨的斗争中，荷兰共产党必须在思想和行动上同国际共产主义运动和它的先锋队——苏联共产党并肩前进。
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社阿姆斯特丹6日讯：荷兰共产党第十八次代表大会5日晚间和6日上午的会议上继续讨论格鲁特和胡克斯特拉的报告。在讨论报告时发言的共有四十人。
    会上，发言人谈到了党的工作的各个方面，对代表大会的决议草案提出了许多有价值的建议和修正。讨论是在充分一致和十分热情的气氛中进行的。
    胡克斯特拉就两个报告作了总结发言。代表大会还宣读了下列国家的各兄弟共产党和工人党给大会的贺电，其中有中华人民共和国、印度尼西亚、印度、德意志民主共和国、挪威、冰岛、捷克斯洛伐克、芬兰、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、丹麦、罗马尼亚。
    代表大会接着一致通过了总决议。
    代表大会还通过一项决议，同意党中央委员会对苏联共产党第二十次代表大会所采取的立场，并且表示完全支持苏联共产党中央委员会6月30日“关于克服个人崇拜及其后果”的决议。
    代表大会委托中央委员会草拟新党章草案并提交下次代表大会批准。
    大会最后听取和讨论了荷兰“真理报”编辑巴克尔所作的关于党中央机关报的工作的报告，并且通过了相应的决议。根据资格审查委员会的报告，出席代表大会的有三百三十六名有表决权的代表和七十五名有发言权的代表。在6日晚间和7日将举行代表大会的闭幕会议，会上将选举新的中央委员会。
