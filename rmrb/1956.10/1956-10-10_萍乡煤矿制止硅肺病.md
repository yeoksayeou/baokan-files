Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 8th. The Pingxiang Mining Bureau Workers' Hospital recently conducted a general check-up of the miners working on underground rock tunnel excavation, and the results showed that no silicosis patients were found among the workers engaged in rock tunnel excavation since the second quarter of last year. The development of silicosis, an occupational disease of underground rock tunnel excavators, has been basically halted.

This is the result of the Pingxiang Mining Bureau's adoption of the "water-infused center of the rock drill" method, based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, to prevent silicosis among underground rock tunnel excavators.

    萍乡煤矿制止硅肺病
    新华社南昌8日电　萍乡矿务局职工医院最近对井下石门掘进工人进行了一次普遍检查，结果表明，从去年第二季度以来，参加石门掘进工作的工人中没有发现一个硅肺病患者。井下石门掘进工人的职业病——硅肺病的发展，已经基本得到制止。
    这是萍乡矿务局根据苏联专家的建议，采取“风钻中心加水”方法来防止井下石门掘进工人硅肺病所取得的成果。
