Thoughts on Relocation

    The relocation of Jiaotong University to Xi'an has been reported in various newspapers, invariably with descriptions like "beautiful scenery" and "everyone is very satisfied."

    We, the students of Jiaotong University, have come to the new campus in Xi'an but feel very dissatisfied. It's not that we're dissatisfied with the relocation itself, but rather with the buildings here. Just look at what our new school buildings have been built like!

    Taking the overall layout as an example, as long as you visit the site and take a look around, all you see are houses with gray bricks and red tiles. The most amazing thing is that the styles are identical, as if there is only one form of architecture in the world. Without someone to guide you, you wouldn't be able to tell which is a classroom, which is a dormitory, and which is a dining hall. As for the central building, the main project currently under construction, it is the most important building in the entire school, with a construction area of ​​more than 30,000 square meters. Unfortunately, such a major building also lacks its own characteristics. It is an unharmonious patchwork of four dormitory-like buildings, and the appearance is very disproportionate.

    Not only that, but there are also many problems with the design of individual buildings. As a classroom, the most important requirement is sufficient light, but the light in the classrooms here is insufficient. Some classrooms are dark even on sunny days, let alone cloudy days. Secondly, many people walk in and out of the classroom building every day, requiring wider doors and stairs. However, the doors here are not only few in number, but also designed very small. Taking the largest main entrance as an example, the width does not exceed the distance of a person's arms outstretched, and the height is not even as high as a raised hand. The stairs are even narrower, with some places only wide enough for two people to walk side by side.

    The quality of construction is also poor. All the houses lack downspouts, making rainy days a cause for concern. Some students had just moved into the dormitory when it happened to coincide with the floor above being repaired with cement. Water seeped down from the ceiling. There are even such pranks in the toilets: just as people are defecating, drops of water drip directly onto their backs, coming either from the cistern or from the sewage pipes of the toilet upstairs. As a result, they have no choice but to finish hastily and run away. The few cement roads in the campus are also already riddled with holes.

    We wonder: is it that after criticizing waste in construction, another deviation has now emerged – perfunctoriness under the guise of "saving" and "accelerating construction speed"? We believe that if the new school buildings of Jiaotong University are only intended to be used temporarily for a few years, and new ones will be built in the future, then it is a bit of a waste; but if they are to be used for a long time, then they are a bit of a disaster.

### 迁校有感

    迁校有感
    交通大学迁校于西安。各报都有报道，无非是“风景优美”、“大家都很满意”之类。
  我们，交通大学的学生，来到西安的新校址，却感到很不满意。不是不满意迁校，而是不满意这里的建筑。请看我们的新校舍给建筑成什么样子！
    拿总体布置来说，只要你亲临现场，巡礼一周，眼中所见尽是青砖红瓦的房屋，最妙的是式样一致，仿佛世界上的建筑物就只有这么一种形式。如果没有人指点，你就无从知道哪个是教室，哪个是宿舍，哪个是饭厅。至于最近动工的主体工程——中心大楼，是全校建筑中的主要部分，建筑面积达三万多平方公尺。遗憾的是，这样一个主要的建筑，也同样没有自己的特色。它是由四个宿舍般的楼房不谐和地拼凑起来的，样子很不相称。
    不仅如此，单个建筑物的设计也有许多问题。作为教室，最主要的要求，莫过于光线充足，可是这里的教室光线却很不足，有些教室甚至晴天也很阴暗，阴天更不用说了。其次，教室楼每天有许多人走进走出，需要有比较宽的门和楼梯。可是这里的门不但少，而且设计得很小，拿最大的正门来说，宽度不超过一个人两手平伸的距离，高度还不及一抬手。楼梯更是狭窄，有些地方只能容两人并排走。
    建筑的质量也是不好的，所有的房屋都没有水落管，下雨天让人发愁。有的同学刚搬进宿舍，恰巧碰到楼上在补水泥地板。天花板上就往下渗水。厕所里更有这样的恶作剧：人们正当大便时，一滴一滴的水珠直往背脊上滴，它们不是来自贮水箱，就是来自楼上厕所的污水管。结果，只好草草结束，逃之夭夭。校区仅有的几条水泥路也已经百孔千疮。
    我们想到：是不是在批判了建筑中的浪费现象之后，现在又出现了另一种偏向——在“节约”和“加快建设速度”的美名下，潦草塞责。我们认为：交通大学的新校舍，如果只准备暂时用几年，将来再建新的，那未免嫌好些；而如果要是长远用下去的，则未免坏了一些。
