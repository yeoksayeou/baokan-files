    Soviet International Cultural Exchange
    G. Kalishyan, Vice-Chairman of the Council of the Soviet Union for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries
    Cultural exchange, like economic ties, will play a significant role in consolidating peace and cooperation among nations. The exchange of cultural achievements among peoples of different countries not only promotes the progress of each country's culture, but also, and equally importantly, promotes mutual understanding in spiritual life, thereby enhancing mutual trust and friendship among peoples.
    The Soviet people, together with the great Chinese people and the people of other socialist countries, actively support mutually beneficial contacts in science, literature, art, sports, and travel with the people of all countries.
    In the Soviet Union, as in all socialist countries, there are not only no restrictions on international cooperation, but also various conditions are created to develop such cooperation. In the Soviet Union, the implementation of international cultural exchange is not just a matter for one or several state organs or mass organizations. It is truly a national undertaking, which attracts state organs, mass organizations, and the broad masses of working people to varying degrees.
    The exchange of delegations is an effective way of cultural exchange. The Soviet people always express their friendship and hospitality to foreign guests, and at the same time, they try to visit foreign countries as much as possible. In recent years, the scope of delegation exchanges has been particularly extensive.
    In addition to government, parliamentary, and many other official delegations, various political parties and professional delegations, as well as delegations from cultural, educational, and scientific fields, youth, women, cooperatives, sports, and other social groups, have visited the Soviet Union. In addition, many theatrical, song and dance, acrobatic, and musical groups, as well as concert performers and sports teams, have visited the Soviet Union. Individual social activists and workers in science, literature, and art also often come to the Soviet Union for visits.
    In 1955 alone, the Soviet Ministry of Culture, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the Sports Committee, and the Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries invited 5,676 guests to visit the Soviet Union, and these organizations sent 5,069 people to visit foreign countries. There is good reason to estimate that the total number of foreign delegations visiting the Soviet Union this year will greatly exceed last year's figures.
    The guests of the Soviet Union are people of various professions, different financial conditions, and different political and religious beliefs, but the vast majority of them are manual and mental laborers.
    It is difficult to list all the places our guests have visited in the Soviet Union. Members of foreign delegations visit factories, state farms, collective farms, and machine tractor stations in the union republics, autonomous republics, border regions, states, cities, and villages; they learn about new industrial constructions and agricultural conditions on wasteland; they learn about schools, hospitals, cultural and educational institutions, kindergartens, theaters, workers' clubs, and rural clubs; they visit the homes of workers, collective farm members, scientists, writers, and actors.
    In unconstrained and friendly conversations with Soviet people, guests often engage in debates, which are very helpful in clarifying many issues.
    While learning about the actual situation in the Soviet Union, guests also took the opportunity to introduce the institutions, economy, science, literature, and art of their countries to the Soviet people, and gave lectures and reports at universities and meetings of the working people. We believe that the delegation of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, which was a guest in the Soviet Union from May to June 1956, set an example in this regard. The members of the delegation gave a total of forty presentations and reports on the people's China, which aroused great interest among the audience.
    Many foreign guests published their impressions of the Soviet Union in Soviet newspapers and radio and television broadcasts, and wrote books about the Soviet Union after returning to their home countries. The delegation of Chinese legal workers, headed by Shi Liang, Minister of Justice of the People's Republic of China, who was a guest in the Soviet Union in 1955, put in a great and diligent effort in this regard. During a period of one and a half months, they became familiar with the lives of the Soviet people and the activities of the Soviet judicial organs. After returning to their home country, the members of the delegation systematically organized the carefully collected materials into two books, which were quickly published in China.
    When Soviet scientists, literary and art workers, and advanced workers in industry, agriculture, and transportation visit foreign countries, they sincerely accept requests to give professional speeches and reports, and introduce professional experience. The Soviet press systematically publishes articles and features by members of Soviet delegations returning from foreign visits. They gave extensive speeches at meetings, on radio and television, and published books and pamphlets they wrote.
    In 1955 and 1956, foreign tourists traveled to the Soviet Union, and Soviet citizens traveled to many countries in the world on a large scale. In 1955 alone, 6,000 tourists came to the Soviet Union, and the number of people traveling to the Soviet Union this year will be much higher than this figure. Thousands of Soviet citizens used travel to spend their holidays. The sea route around Europe, passing through many countries, from Odessa to Leningrad is widely welcomed in the Soviet Union.
    A large part of the Soviet Union's international exchanges is the exchange of exhibitions. These exhibitions introduce the level of industry and agriculture and the cultural construction of the Soviet Union and the countries exchanging exhibitions.
    In all the socialist countries in the West and the East, and in many capitalist countries, there are friendship and cultural associations with the Soviet Union, which play an active role in promoting cultural exchange. Among these organizations, which take the friendship and cooperation between the people of their country and the Soviet people as their lofty work goal, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has the most members and the best content and methods of various activities. This organization enjoys due prestige both in China and in the Soviet Union.
    Literature plays a particularly important role in cultural exchange and bringing the people of all countries closer together.
    From 1918 to 1955, the Soviet Union published a total of 1,276 works by foreign authors, with a total of 365 million copies. In 1955 alone, the Soviet State Literary Publishing House published 27 million copies of books translated from 42 languages in the world. The State Foreign Language Publishing House publishes foreign language books in English, Albanian, Arabic, Bengali, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Dutch, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Latin, Mongolian, German, Polish, Romanian, Serbian-Croatian, Urdu, French, Hindi, Czech, Swedish, and Japanese. This year, the publishing house published a total of 440 titles, with more than 8 million copies.
    The Soviet people widely commemorate the anniversaries of outstanding foreign social activists, scientists, writers, artists, and actors, expressing their respect for them. For example, in 1956, mass rallies, evenings, and meetings of scientific institutions were held to commemorate these world cultural figures: Franklin, Mozart, Heine, Pierre Curie, Ibsen, Rembrandt, Shaw, Pasteur, Weber, Stephenson, Tesla, Qi Baishi, and others.
    The Soviet Union's ties with many countries in the film industry have greatly expanded and strengthened. Holding foreign film weeks in the Soviet Union has become a traditional practice. During the film weeks, outstanding works of foreign film art are screened. Film weeks of most people's democratic countries and some capitalist countries have been held in the Soviet Union. During the film weeks, some of the actors who played roles in the screened films came to the Soviet Union to meet the audience. Soviet film worker delegations also participated in Soviet film weeks held in foreign countries. Soviet films also actively participate in international film festivals.
    The exchange of creative works by film workers and the mutual appreciation of outstanding works of film art can not only promote the common development of film art, but also be a very valuable way to bring the people of all countries closer together and cooperate in a friendly manner. The joint filming of films by Soviet film crews and film workers from China, Mongolia, Bulgaria, Albania, and other socialist countries is the best material manifestation of this cooperation itself.
    Foreign films, especially films from socialist countries, are often shown on the screens of Soviet cinemas.
    Soviet theaters widely stage outstanding works by foreign playwrights and composers. It is no exaggeration to say that there is not a single theater or concert hall in the Soviet Union that has not staged operas, dramas, and symphonic works by foreign classical and modern composers and playwrights.
    The Soviet people conduct genuine, equal international cooperation with the great Chinese people and the people of all socialist countries, especially in cultural exchange. The unbreakable and fraternal friendship and comprehensive cooperation among the people of these countries is an inspiring example of new international relations for all mankind.
    The increasingly consolidated cultural exchanges between the Soviet Union and all countries greatly promote the further easing of international tensions.

    苏联的国际文化交流
    苏联对外文化协会理事会副主席　格·卡利希扬
    文化交流和经济联系一样，在巩固和平和各国人民间的合作事业中将会起巨大的作用。各国人民间文化成就的交流不仅能促进各国文化的进步，而且同样重要的是能促进在精神生活上的相互了解，从而增进各国人民的相互信任和友谊。
    苏联人民和伟大的中国人民以及其他社会主义国家的人民积极拥护在科学、文学、艺术、体育、旅行等方面开展同一切国家人民互相有益的接触。
    在苏联，同在一切的社会主义国家里一样，在国际合作方面，不仅没有任何限制，而且为了发展这种合作创造各种各样的条件，在苏联，实现国际文化交流并不只是一个和几个国家机关或群众团体的事情。它真正是全民的工作，这项工作在不同的程度上吸引了国家机关、群众团体以及广大的劳动人民。
    交换代表团是文化交流的一个有效的方式。苏联人民对外国来的客人永远表示他们的友谊和好客，同时也尽可能地到外国去访问。在最近几年中交换代表团的范围特别广泛。
    来到苏联访问的，除去政府的、议会的和很多其他的官方代表团之外，还有各种不同政党和职业的代表团以及文教和科学的、青年的、妇女的、合作社的、体育的和其他社会团体的代表团。此外，到苏联访问的还有很多戏剧、歌舞、杂技、音乐团体和举行单独表演的音乐会的表演人以及体育队等。个别的社会活动家以及科学、文学、艺术方面的工作者也常到苏联来访问。
    在1955年内，单是由苏联文化部、全苏工会中央理事会、体育运动委员会和对外文化协会邀请来苏联访问的客人就有五千六百七十六人，这些组织派到外国去访问的有五千零六十九人。有充分根据估计，今年内访问苏联的外国代表团的总数将大大超过去年的数字。
    苏联的客人们是各种职业、不同的财产状况、不同的政治和宗教信仰的人，但他们绝大多数都是体力和脑力劳动者。
    要想列举一下我国客人们到过苏联哪些地方是件困难的事。外国代表团的团员们在加盟共和国、自治共和国、边疆区、州、城市、乡村里访问工厂、国营农场、集体农庄和机器拖拉机站；了解工业方面的新建设、荒地上的农业情况，了解学校、医院、文教机关、幼儿园、剧院、工人俱乐部和农村俱乐部；到工人、集体农庄庄员、科学家、作家和演员们的家里去访问。
    客人们在同苏联人无拘束的友好的谈话中，时常发生争论，这些争论对明确许多问题很有帮助。
    客人们一方面了解了苏联的实际情况，一方面利用在苏联的时机向苏联人介绍了他们国家的机构、经济、科学、文学和艺术，在高等学校和劳动人民的会议上作了讲演和报告。我们认为，1956年5月到6月在苏联作客的中苏友好协会代表团在这方面作出了范例。代表团的团员们一共举行了四十次关于人民中国的传达和报告，这些传达和报告都引起了听众的极大兴趣。
    很多外国客人在苏联的报刊上、广播电台和电视中发表了他们在苏联的印象，并且在回国后写了关于苏联的书。1955年在苏联作客的、以中华人民共和国司法部长史良为首的中国法律工作者代表团在这方面付出了巨大的和辛勤的劳动。在一个半月的期间，他们熟悉了苏联人民的生活和苏维埃司法机关的活动。回国后，代表团的团员们把仔细搜集到的材料系统地整理成两本书，这两本书很快地就在中国出版了。
    苏联的科学家、文学艺术工作者、工业农业和交通运输业的先进工作者到外国访问时，他们对于作专业的演讲和报告、介绍专业的经验等要求都诚恳地接受了。苏联的报刊系统地发表了从国外访问回来的苏联代表团团员们的文章和特写。他们在会议上，在广播和电视中广泛地发表了演说，出版了他们写的书和小册子。
    在1955年到1956年中，外国旅行家到苏联来旅行，苏联公民到世界上很多国家的旅行的规模是很大的。1955年一年中到苏联来的旅行家有六千人，而今年来苏联旅行的人还要大大超过这个数字。数千个苏联公民利用旅行度过假日。敖德萨—列宁格勒这条环绕欧洲、经过很多国家的海路航线，在苏联受到普遍的欢迎。
    在苏联的国际交往中很大一部分是交换展览会。通过这些展览会介绍了苏联和交换展览会国家的工农业的水平、文化建设情况。
    在西方和东方所有的社会主义国家里，在许多资本主义国家里都有对苏友好和文化协会，它们对文化交流起了积极的促进作用。在这些把自己国家人民同苏联人民的友谊和合作作为自己的崇高的工作目的组织中，成员最多、并有各种各样活动的内容和方式最好的是中苏友好协会。这个组织无论在中国或在苏联都享有应有的声誉。
    在各国人民间的文化交流和使各国人民接近方面，文学起着特别重要的作用。
    从1918年到1955年，苏联一共出版了一千二百七十六个外国作家的三亿六千五百万册书。仅在1955年一年间苏联国家文艺书籍出版局就出版了从世界上四十二种语文翻译过来的二千七百万册书。国家外国文书籍出版局出版了英文、阿尔巴尼亚文、阿拉伯文、孟加拉文、保加利亚文、匈牙利文、荷兰文、西班牙文、中文、朝鲜文、拉丁文、蒙文、德文、波兰文、罗马尼亚文、塞尔维亚—克罗地亚文、乌尔都文、法文、印地文、捷克文、瑞典文、日文等外文书籍。今年，这个出版局一共出版了四百四十种，八百多万册书。
    每逢外国的杰出的社会活动家、科学家、作家、艺术家、演员们的纪念日，苏联人民都广泛地纪念，表示对他们的尊敬。例如在1956年，举行了群众集会、晚会、科学机关的会议来纪念这些世界文化名人：富兰克林、莫扎特、海?、皮埃尔·居里、易卜生、伦勃朗、萧伯纳、巴斯德、魏伯尔、斯蒂芬生、杰斯拉、齐白石以及其他一些人。
    苏联同很多国家在电影业方面的联系大大扩大和加强了。在苏联举行外国电影周已成了传统的作法，在电影周期间放映外国电影艺术的优秀作品，在苏联已经举行过大多数人民民主国家和一些资本主义国家的电影周。在举行电影周的时候，在放映的影片中扮演角色的演员有的来到苏联同观众见面。苏联电影工作者代表团也参加外国举行的苏联电影周。苏联的电影也积极参加国际电影节。
    电影工作者的创作的交流，电影艺术优秀作品的互相观摩，不仅能促进电影艺术的共同发展，而且也是各国人民接近和友好合作事业的一种很可贵的方法。苏联电影摄制人员和中国、蒙古、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚以及其他社会主义国家电影工作人员的联合拍摄影片就是这种合作本身的最好的物质表现。
    在苏联的影院的银幕上经常上映外国影片，特别是社会主义国家的影片。
    苏联剧院广泛地上演外国戏剧家和作曲家的优秀作品。毫不夸张地说：在苏联没有一个剧院和音乐厅没有上演过外国的古典的和现代的作曲家、戏剧家的歌剧、戏剧和交响乐作品等。
    苏联人民同伟大的中国人民以及所有的社会主义国家的人民进行真正的平等的国际合作，特别是在文化交流方面。这些国家人民的牢不可破和兄弟般的友谊和全面的合作，是全人类新的国际关系的鼓舞人心的范例。
    苏联同所有国家的日益巩固的文化交流在很大程度上促进国际紧张局势的进一步缓和。
