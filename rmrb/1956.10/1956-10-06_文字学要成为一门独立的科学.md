    Philology Must Become an Independent Science
    Tang Lan
    Philology is the science of studying writing systems.
    Philology studies the laws of the origin and development of all writing systems, the history and characteristics of various writing systems, the classifications of various writing systems, the comparisons between various writing systems, the relationship between writing systems and socio-cultural development, the relationship between writing systems and language and thought, the relationship between writing systems and art, and the relationship between writing systems and writing tools and printing technology, etc.
    Philology studies all kinds of writing systems: it needs to study ancient Chinese characters (such as oracle bone script, bronze inscriptions, etc.), as well as the Chinese characters that are currently in use; it needs to study minority scripts that have long been discontinued (such as Turkic script, Jurchen script, Western Xia script, etc.), as well as the existing Tibetan, Mongolian, Uyghur, and Yi scripts; it needs to study hieroglyphs like Egyptian and Sumerian, as well as Native American hieroglyphs; it needs to study Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, and Hebrew, as well as Russian, English, French, and German, etc.
    Some people mistakenly include philology in linguistics, but these are actually two completely different sciences. The object of linguistics is spoken language that is heard with the ears, while the object of philology is handwriting that is seen with the eyes. Language and writing each have their own laws of origin and development, each has its own history—language history and writing history. Language existed long before writing was produced, but writing can still exist long after a language has died out. People can completely understand a language without knowing the characters that represent it, and can also recognize the characters without knowing the language they represent. In short, although these two sciences are closely related and inseparable, they are still two sciences, with different objects of study and different methods, and cannot be confused as one.
    Of course, philology, except in China, has not yet been well developed, but this does not mean that philology does not need to be developed. The study of Egyptian and Babylonian hieroglyphics, and the paleography of ancient manuscripts, has long been established in Western countries. What a pity is that various scripts have not been comparatively studied, and a new philology that studies the general laws of the development of all scripts has not been established. We know that new linguistics developed after the nineteenth century, and philology has lagged behind. But the development of linguistics cannot replace philology. What all nations with long-standing historical cultures can be proud of is that they have preserved a large number of documents recorded in writing, but in the past, no beautiful language could be preserved. We study ancient languages and have to rely on documents recorded in writing. Without the study of ancient writing, it would be impossible to study extinct ancient languages. On the other hand, even for phonetic scripts that reflect modern languages, the study of philology is different from that of linguistics. For example, the history of various letters, the history of symbols, the structural style of characters, the way characters are coordinated with language, the development of writing styles and printing fonts, etc., are not linguistic issues. If there were only language and had not yet become writing, there would be no such problems.
    The roles that writing and language play in the process of social development are very different. All nations have their own languages, but not all have writing. The emergence of writing is a milestone in the progress of human culture. Writing is a bridge from primitive society to civilized society. In addition to the development of productive forces, writing is one of the main tools for accumulating experience, expanding wisdom, and promoting human progress. If language, as a tool, is compared to the "fire" first used by ancient humans, then writing, as a tool, can be compared to the modern "steam engine." It is not difficult to see that studying writing is different from studying language, just as studying steam engines is different from studying fire. If, because writing reflects language, it is said that language can include writing, then it should be said that fire can include steam engines. The former forgets that writing is a special tool, and the latter also forgets that the steam engine is a new tool that divides the entire era.
    If we understand the particularity of writing as a tool, it is not difficult to see the importance of philology as a science. Writing reflects language and thought, not like an elusive shadow, but as a tool. Since it is a tool, it has its own characteristics. Studying the nature and characteristics of each script, studying the historical development and laws of each script, studying the interrelationships between various scripts, studying the general laws of script development, and studying the special laws of writing as a tool, will enable this tool of writing to continuously develop and improve, to be more widely used by mankind, and to make greater contributions to the forward development of human society. Writing is an indispensable tool in the daily life of everyone in civilized society. Linguistics cannot replace philology. People should not and cannot only study language without studying writing. The science of studying writing will surely develop fully. With the development of linguistics, the importance of philology is increasingly revealed. One wheel cannot go far. In the twentieth century, a new philology will surely be established.
    Obviously, just as the study of Sanskrit played a role in the development of modern linguistics, Chinese philology will be able to provide some experience and play a certain role in establishing a new philology. Chinese writing is a miracle and a treasure trove in the world. It is one of the oldest scripts in the world, but it is also one of the most widely used and the richest in preserving cultural heritage. Its peers, such as Egyptian and Sumerian scripts, have long died out, but it still exists and is used. It has its own unique system. For thousands of years, it has used only a few thousand commonly used single characters to express the incredibly rich vocabulary of the Chinese language. For thousands of years, hundreds of millions of people in our country have created, enriched, and skillfully used their own tools in their daily lives, and have a very complete set of historical experiences.
    Due to these characteristics, China has always been the most developed country in philological research. As early as two thousand five or six hundred years ago, there were already sprouts of philology. In the first century BC, the rulers of the Han Dynasty convened two meetings to discuss elementary studies. At the end of the first century AD, the classic work of Chinese philology, "Shuowen Jiezi," appeared. From the eighth century onwards, especially in the last three hundred years, thousands of philologists have sorted out and studied this work. After the sixth century, the "character rectification" movement of philologists stabilized the regular script of Chinese characters for a long time. After the tenth century, Guo Zhongshu and others carried out the study of ancient scripts, which has been greatly developed since the nineteenth century and has now become a very important science, closely related to the study of ancient history, culture, language, and literature. After the twelfth century, the study of the six writing principles (六书) unfolded the study of the laws of the origin and development of Chinese characters, and has made greater progress in the last hundred years after the large-scale discovery of ancient writing materials. After the seventeenth century, the issue of Chinese character pinyin was raised, and rich experience has been accumulated in the past three hundred years. Studies on variant characters, simplified characters, and dialect characters have also been very developed in the past two hundred years.
    The forms of Chinese dictionaries with more than two thousand years of experience are diverse. They can be divided into four categories: those edited from the shape of the character, from the stroke order, from the sound, and from the meaning. There are dictionaries that synthesize various fonts, as well as dictionaries that specifically record the characters on those objects (such as seals, coins, etc.), and even dictionaries that specifically record that type of font (such as clerical script, cursive script). The history of Chinese calligraphy art is even longer, and there have been many specialized works on the theory and techniques of calligraphy, the history of calligraphy, etc., throughout the ages.
    Of course, there are also many foreign scholars engaged in the study of Chinese philology. As early as the ninth century, the "Myriad Images and Meanings" (万象名义) by the Japanese monk Kukai and the "Character Mirror" (字镜) by Changzhu were important materials for Chinese philology. Up to the present, Japanese scholars have continued to study Chinese characters and have made many contributions. Since the seventeenth century, Western scholars have also worked hard on the study of Chinese characters. Recently, Mr. Eichhorn, a German sinologist from the German Democratic Republic, is leading the editing of a dictionary of ancient Chinese characters.
    Chinese philology reflects some of the experiences of the Chinese people in using and developing writing over thousands of years and will be an important part of the new philological research. The history of the development of writing in any nation has its own important and rich experiences. Philologists need to devote themselves to in-depth research on individual scripts, and also need to study the common laws of all scripts. Whether they are studying Chinese characters, Egyptian, Sumerian, Indian, Greek, Latin, Arabic, or Native American scripts, philologists should recognize that philology is a very important independent science. Philologists around the world should unite, learn from each other, enrich their knowledge, exchange experiences, and work together to establish a new philology in the twentieth century.

    文字学要成为一门独立的科学
    唐兰
    文字学是研究文字的科学。
    文字学研究一切文字发生和发展的规律，各种文字的历史及其特点，各种文字的类属，各种文字之间的比较，文字跟社会文化发展的关系，文字和语言跟思维的关系，文字跟艺术的关系，文字和书写工具跟印刷技术的关系等。
    文字学研究各式各样的文字：既需要研究古代中国文字（如甲骨文、金文等），也需要研究现在使用着的汉字；既需要研究早已不用的少数民族文字（如突厥文、女真文、西夏文等），也需要研究现存的西藏文、蒙古文、维文、彝文等；既需要研究埃及、苏马连等象形文字，也需要研究印第安人的象形文字；既需要研究希腊、拉丁、梵文、希伯来文等，也需要研究俄文、英文、法文、德文等。
    有些人错误地把文字学包括到语言学里去，其实这是两门完全不同的科学。语言学的对象是口头说的而用耳朵听的语音，文字学的对象则是手写的而用眼睛瞧的字体。语言和文字，各有它自己的发生和发展的规律，各有它自己的历史——语言史和文字史。当文字还没有产生以前早就有语言，但在语言死亡已久的时候，还可以存在着文字。人们完全可以只懂那种语言而并不认识代表它的文字，也尽可以只认识那种文字而不知道它所代表的语言。总之，这两门科学尽管血肉相关，是不可分割的，但究竟是两门科学，研究的对象不同，方法不同，不能混而为一。
    固然，文字学，除了中国外，还没有很好发展，但这不等于文字学不需要发展。研究埃及巴比仑的象形文字学，研究古抄本的古文字学在西方国家也早就建立了。所可惜的是没有把各种文字作比较研究，并建立起研究一切文字发展的一般规律的新的文字学。我们知道新的语言学是在十九世纪以后发展起来的，文字学是落后了。但语言学的发展不能代替文字学。世界上一切具有悠久历史文化的民族所值得自豪的是他们保存着用文字记载下来的大量文献，但在过去，任何优美的语言是不能保存下来的。我们研究古代语言，还得倚仗用文字记载下来的文献，没有古文字的研究，就不可能研究已经死亡的古代语言。另一方面，就是反映现代语言的拼音文字，文字学的研究也跟语言学不一样，例如：各种字母的历史，符号的历史，文字的结构方式，文字配合语言的方式，书写形式和印刷体的发展等等，都不能是语言学上的问题。假如只有语言而还没有成为文字，也就没有这些问题。
    文字和语言在社会发展的过程里所起的作用，有很大的不同。一切民族都有自己的语言，但并不都有文字。文字的产生是人类文化前进的一个里程碑。文字是由原始社会发展到文明社会的桥梁，除了生产力发展之外，文字是积累经验，扩大智慧，推动人类进步的主要工具之一。如果把语言这一工具比作远古人类最初利用的“火”，那末，文字这一工具，可以比为近代的“蒸汽机”。人们不难看出研究文字不同于研究语言，正如研究蒸汽机不同于研究火。如果因为文字反映语言，就说语言可以包括文字，那就该说火可以包括蒸汽机了。前者忘记了文字是一种特殊的工具，后者也恰恰忘记了蒸汽机是划分整个时代的新工具。
    如果懂得文字这一种工具的特殊性，也就不难看出文字学这一门科学的重要性。文字反映语言和思维，不是像影子一样不可捉摸而是一种工具。既然是工具，就有它自己的特点。研究每一种文字的性质和特点，研究每一种文字的历史发展和其规律，研究各种文字之间的相互关系，研究文字发展的一般规律，研究文字这一种工具的特殊规律，将使文字这一种工具能够不断地发展和改进，能够更广泛地为人类利用，为人类社会的向前发展，做出更大的贡献。文字是文明社会里每个人的日常生活中不可缺少的工具，语言学不能代替文字学，人们不应该也不可能只研究语言而不研究文字，研究文字的科学一定会充分发展起来。随着语言学的发展，愈加显示了文字学的重要性，一个轮子是走不远的，在二十世纪里，新的文字学一定会建立起来。
    显然，像梵语的研究在近代语言学发展中所起的作用一样，在建立新的文字学时，中国文字学将能提供一些经验，起一定的作用。中国文字在世界上是一个奇迹，也是一个宝库。它是世界上最古老的文字之一，但也是使用最广泛，保存文化遗产最丰富的文字之一。跟它同辈的埃及、苏马连等文字都早已死亡了，但它还存在着、使用着。它有它自己的独有的体系，几千年来，它只用几千个常用的单字就可以表达出中国语言中无比丰富的语汇。几千年中我国亿万人民在日常生活中创造了、丰富了、并巧妙地运用了自己的工具，有一套十分完整的历史经验。
    由于这些特点，中国一向是文字学研究最发达的国家。远在两千五六百年前，就已经有了文字学的萌芽。公元前一世纪汉朝的统治者曾经召集过两次讨论小学的会议。公元一世纪末出现了中国文字学的经典著作——说文解字，从八世纪起，尤其是近三百年内，数以千计的文字学者曾经整理和研究这部著作。六世纪以后文字学者们的“正字”运动，使得中国文字的楷书体得到长期的稳定。十世纪以后，郭忠恕等开展了古代文字研究，十九世纪以后得到了巨大的发展，在目前已成为很重要的一门科学，跟古代历史、文化、语言、文学等研究，有密切的关系。十二世纪以后的六书学，展开了中国文字发生和发展的规律的研究，在近百年来古文字资料大量发现后有更大的进步。十七世纪以后汉字拼音的问题提出来了，三百多年中已积累了很丰富的经验。关于别体字、简体字、方言字等研究，在近两百年内也是十分发展的。
    有两千多年经验的中国字典的形式是多种多样的。可以分为从字形，从笔画，从声音，从意义来编辑的四大类。有综合各种字体的字典，也有专录那些器物（如玺印、钱币等）上的文字的字典，更有专录那一类字体（如隶书、草书）的字典。中国书法艺术的历史更为悠久，历代有不少研究书法的理论和技巧，书法的历史等专门著作。
    当然，从事中国文字学的研究的，还有很多外国学者。远在九世纪时日本僧空海的万象名义，昌住的字镜，都是中国文字学的重要资料。一直到现代，日本学者不断地研究中国文字，有很多贡献。从十七世纪以后，西方学者对中国文字的研究也是很努力的。最近，德意志民主共和国汉学家爱吉士先生正在领导着编辑一部中国古文字字典。
    中国文字学反映出中国人民在几千年的长时期里利用和发展文字的一些经验，将是新的文字学研究里很重要的一部分。任何民族的文字发展历史各有自己的重要的和丰富的经验。文字学家需要致力于个别文字的深入研究，也需要研究一切文字的共同规律。无论研究中国文字、埃及、苏马连文字、印度文字、希腊、拉丁文字、阿拉伯文字或印第安文字等的文字学家，都应该认识到文字学是一门十分重要的独立的科学。全世界的文字学家应该团结起来，互相学习，丰富知识，交流经验，共同为建立二十世纪新的文字学而努力。
