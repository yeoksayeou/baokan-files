    Visiting Jorge Amado
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Wan Guang
    While in Rio de Janeiro, we visited the famous Brazilian writer Jorge Amado. This year marks the 25th anniversary of Amado's career as a published author.
    Amado's home is in a tall apartment building in Copacabana, on the Atlantic coast of Rio de Janeiro. Approaching Amado's residence, the first thing one sees is a simply and elegantly decorated living room. Paintings hang on the walls, including works by Chinese painters Qi Baishi and Xu Beihong. Amado is fond of collecting handicrafts from various countries. In the living room, study, and bedroom, rows of handicrafts from many countries in the Americas, Europe, and Asia are displayed, including ivory carvings that Amado personally brought back from his visit to China.
    On the wall of Amado's study are pinned images of the Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea and Chinese paper-cuts. On the bookshelves filled with books are various editions of Amado's works, including a red-covered edition of the complete works of Jorge Amado in Portuguese. Many translated versions of Amado's works are also arranged together, including Chinese translations of his two novels "The Knight of Hope" and "The Land of Endless Horizons." Amado said that he had not yet received the Chinese translation of his other novel, "The Violent Land."
    Amado's wife brought out an autograph book and asked the guests to sign it as a memento. In this book, we saw inscriptions by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, Soviet writers Alexander Fadeyev and Ilya Ehrenburg, Cuban writer Nicolás Guillén, and Chinese poet Xiao San.
    At a typical Brazilian family dinner hosted by Amado's wife, Amado talked to us about his writing and life.
    Amado said that he had lived in Europe for four and a half years from 1948 to 1952. There he wrote two books. One was a collection of impressions from visits to the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. The other was the novel "The Underdogs." He said that this was the first part of a lengthy novel depicting the struggle of the Brazilian people and that he planned to write three parts.
    He then talked about his new creative plans. He said he had already begun writing a novel depicting the changes in the life of a typical small town in northern Brazil. The novel begins with the town's residents living in poverty. Later, the Americans brought their "culture" and opened a large casino in the town. The residents originally thought this would bring prosperity, but they were disappointed and dissatisfied as a result. Amado said it was a satirical novel. He said that after finishing this novel, he would continue writing the sequel to "The Underdogs," the second part of which would be titled "People in the Square," depicting the situation during the war from 1941 to 1945.
    Amado is currently the editor of "Para Todos," a very influential cultural publication in Brazil. This publication was only founded three months ago and has already been distributed to 400 towns in Brazil, with a circulation of 35,000 copies per issue. This publication connects writers of various schools of thought in Brazil. Many famous Brazilian writers, poets, and artists have published articles in this publication, including Catholic writers.
    When we were in Rio de Janeiro, we saw an issue of "Para Todos" with very rich content. It included an introduction to the São Paulo Museum of Modern Art in Brazil, an introduction to Argentine and Japanese films, and a review of the American writer Ernest Hemingway's novels. Because the cultural circles of Latin American countries have not had enough exchanges in the past, they do not know much about the literature and art of neighboring countries. "Para Todos" is particularly committed to the cultural exchange work of Latin American countries, publishing introductions to the literature and art of other Latin American countries and distributing the publication to the literary and art circles of other Latin American countries.
    On the day Amado spoke with us, he was busy editing the new issue of "Para Todos." He told us that the new issue would have eight pages dedicated to comments, reports, and photos about the performance of the Chinese Art Troupe in Brazil. There were a total of twenty articles about the art troupe, including articles written by the Brazilian Minister of Education and Culture Salgado and the President of the University of Brazil Calmon. He said that the articles received were more numerous and longer than expected, which made them feel cramped in the arrangement. He said that everyone gave a very good evaluation of the Chinese Art Troupe's performance.
    From the situation of "Para Todos" uniting the Brazilian literary and art circles, Amado talked about the situation of the entire Brazilian literary and art circles. He said that the first Brazilian National Congress of Cultural Circles held in February 1954 was the first big step in the widespread unity of the Brazilian literary and art circles. Representatives from seventeen departments such as literature, drama, music, and painting participated in the congress, discussing issues such as defending Brazilian national culture, conducting cultural exchanges with other countries, the work of the cultural circles, and aesthetics. The congress was very successful and passed a common resolution advocating the maintenance of peace, national independence, and democratic rights.
    Amado said that there are three characteristics of Brazilian literature. The first is the tradition of loving peace. The Brazilian people are against war, and there is a clause in the Brazilian constitution against aggression. Secondly, although Brazil has many races, including whites, blacks, and Indians, there is no racial discrimination in Brazilian literature. Third, Brazilian writers are connected with the life and struggle of the people. In the history of Brazilian literature, there is a tradition of realism. Brazil's great poets participated in the struggle for independence during the colonial period, the struggle for the emancipation of slaves, and the struggle for the establishment of the republic. Amado said that after the First World War, there was a trend to separate Brazilian literature from the people. However, in the 1930s, the Brazilian literary circles launched a movement to bring literature back to the people, and Amado participated in this movement at that time. Amado said that novels began to return to the people in the 1930s, and they wrote about the lives of urban residents, workers, and farmers.
    Amado told us that the Brazilian literary and art circles with a democratic tradition are moving forward.

    访问亚马多
    新华社记者　万光
    我们在里约热内卢的时候，访问了巴西著名作家若热·亚马多。今年恰巧正是亚马多开始发表创作的第二十五周年。
    亚马多的家在里约热内卢大西洋海滨科帕卡巴纳地方的一幢高大的公寓里。走近亚马多的住宅，首先是一间布置得简朴，幽雅的客厅。墙上挂着画，其中有中国画家齐白石和徐悲鸿的作品。亚马多很喜欢收集各国的手工艺品。在客厅，书房和卧室里，陈列着一排排美洲的，欧洲的和亚洲的许多国家的手工艺品，其中有亚马多在访问中国时亲自带回来的象牙雕刻。
    在亚马多书房的墙上，钉着中国渡海八仙像和中国剪纸。在放满了书的书架上，放着亚马多著作的各种版本，其中有红皮书面的葡萄牙文亚马多全集。亚马多的著作的许多种文字的译本也都排列在一起，里面有他两部小说“希望的骑士”和“无边的土地”的中文译本。亚马多说，他还没有得到他的另一部小说“饥饿的道路”的中文译本。
    亚马多夫人拿出一本签名题词的册子，请客人们签字留念。在这本册子上，我们看到智利诗人聂鲁达，苏联作家法捷耶夫和爱伦堡，古巴作家纪廉，中国诗人萧三的题词。
    在亚马多夫人亲自招待的一顿典型的巴西家庭晚餐席上，亚马多同我们谈起他的创作和生活。
    亚马多说，他从1948年到1952年曾经在欧洲住了四年半时间。在那里他写了两本书。一本是访问苏联和人民民主国家的印象记。另一本是小说“地下的自由”。他说，这是描写巴西人民斗争的长篇小说的第一部，预计要写三部。
    他接着谈到他新的创作计划。他说，他已经开始写一部描写巴西北部一个典型小城的生活变化的小说，小说从小城的居民过着贫困的生活写起。后来美国人带来了他们的“文化”，在小城里开了一个大赌场。小城的居民原来以为这会带来繁荣，但结果失望了，不满了。亚马多说，这是一部带有讽刺性的小说。他说，在写完这部小说以后，他将继续写“地下的自由”的续篇，第二部的题目是“广场上的人们”，写1941年到1945年战争时期的情况。
  亚马多现在主编巴西一家很有影响的文化刊物“大家看”（ParaTodos前译‘帕腊托多斯’），这家刊物创刊才三个多月，已经销行到巴西四百个城镇，每期发行额三万五千份。这家刊物联系着巴西各种思潮的作家们。巴西许多著名的作家，诗人，艺术家都在这个刊物上发表文章，其中包括天主教作家。
    我们在里约热内卢的时候，看到的一期“大家看”的内容是很丰富的。有巴西大城市圣保罗近代艺术馆介绍，阿根廷电影和日本电影介绍，美国作家海明威小说评介等等。由于拉丁美洲国家的文化界过去相互间交流得不够，它们不大了解邻国的文学和艺术，“大家看”特别致力于拉丁美洲国家的文化交流的工作，刊载其他拉丁美洲国家文学艺术介绍，并且把刊物分送给拉丁美洲其他国家的文艺界。
    亚马多同我们谈话的一天，他正忙着在编辑新的一期“大家看”。他告诉我们，新的一期专门有八页篇幅刊载关于中国艺术团在巴西演出的评论文章、报道和照片。一共有二十篇关于艺术团的文字，其中有巴西教育文化部长萨尔加杜，巴西大学校长卡尔蒙写的文章。他说，收到的文章比预约的要多而且写得很长，使得他们在编排上都感到挤不下了。他说，大家都给予中国艺术团演出以很好的评价。
    从“大家看”团结巴西文艺界的情况，亚马多谈到巴西整个文艺界的情况。他说，1954年2月召开的巴西全国第一届文化界代表大会，是巴西文艺界广泛团结起来的第一大步。文学，戏剧，音乐，绘画等十七个部门的代表参加了这个大会，讨论了保卫巴西民族文化，同各国进行文化交流，文化界的工作以及美学上的问题。大会开得很成功，通过了共同的决议，主张维护和平，民族独立和民主权利。
    亚马多说，巴西文学中有三个特点。第一个特点是爱好和平的传统。巴西人民是反对战争的，在巴西宪法上就有反对侵略的一条。其次是，虽然巴西有许多种族，有白人，黑人，印第安人，但是在巴西文学中没有种族歧视。第三是巴西文学家是同人民的生活和斗争联系着的。在巴西文学的历史中，有现实主义的传统。巴西的伟大的诗人们参加过殖民时期争取独立的斗争，参加过争取解放黑奴的斗争，参加过争取建立共和国的斗争。亚马多说，第一次世界大战以后，曾经有过一种要使巴西文学脱离人民的潮流。但是，在三十年代，巴西文学界展开了一个使文学回到人民中来的运动，亚马多当时也参加了这个运动。亚马多说，小说在三十年代就开始重新回到人民中来了，它们写城市居民，工人，农民的生活。
    亚马多对我们说，有着民主传统的巴西文艺界正在前进着。
