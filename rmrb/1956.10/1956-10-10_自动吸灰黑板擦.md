    Automatic Dust-Absorbing Blackboard Eraser
    Teachers will soon be able to use an automatic dust-absorbing blackboard eraser. When using it to erase the blackboard, chalk dust will not fly around.
    This blackboard eraser was successfully developed by Zhang Yilin and Pang Binglian, physics teachers at Shanghai Xin Cheng Middle School and Xiang Ming Middle School, in the past two years using their spare time. The shape of the blackboard eraser is like a toy car, with a rubber wheel installed underneath. When erasing the blackboard, the rotating wheel drives a very small centrifugal pump installed inside the blackboard eraser, sucking the chalk dust into two empty grooves. After many trials, the amount of chalk dust sucked in reached more than 95% of all the chalk dust that was wiped off.
    Now, the Shanghai Cultural and Educational Supplies Industry Company has begun producing this new type of blackboard eraser.

    自动吸灰黑板擦
    教师们不久可以用到一种自动吸灰的黑板擦。用它擦黑板，粉笔灰就不会飞扬。
    这种黑板擦是上海市新成中学和向明中学的物理教师张一林和庞炳连在近两年中利用业余时间研究成功的。黑板擦的形状像一辆玩具小汽车，下面装有一个橡皮轮，擦黑板的时候，转动的轮子带动那装在黑板擦内部的一个很小的离心风泵，把粉笔灰吸到两条空槽里。经过多次试用，吸入的粉笔灰达到被揩刷下来的全部粉笔灰95％以上。
    现在上海市文教用品工业公司已经开始生产这种新的黑板擦。
