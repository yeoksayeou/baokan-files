Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 13th – The Indonesian newspaper "Republika" said today: President Sukarno's suggestion at a welcoming rally in Shanghai that Pacific region countries should conclude a treaty of non-aggression conforms to the Bandung spirit. The newspaper added that it could even be considered a product of the Bandung spirit.

The newspaper said: Since the United States and Britain established the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in this region, Asian and African leaders have always believed it necessary to build mutual trust to defeat the "Asians fighting Asians" policy adopted by Western countries. Concluding such a treaty of non-aggression could increase mutual trust between Asian and African countries, enabling them to reduce defense expenditures and concentrate their efforts on economic construction.

The Indonesian "People's Daily" said: President Sukarno's proposal is excellent and deserves serious consideration by the countries concerned. The newspaper said that this is a major proposal for achieving lasting world peace, because it does not contain any discrimination.

"Bandung News" pointed out on October 12 that no one wants to listen to the nonsense that the People's Republic of China should not be recognized and should be excluded from the United Nations. It said that, as President Sukarno said in Shanghai, anyone who insists on this nonsense will be overwhelmed by the surging tide of anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism.

The newspaper also said: What President Sukarno said at the Shanghai mass rally may have displeased Western countries, especially the United States, the most. But the question is not whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, but that no one can disagree with this objective reality anymore.

The newspaper emphasized: Indonesia hopes to be friendly with China only because it hopes to be friendly with all countries. This does not mean that Indonesia opposes countries that do not recognize China. The newspaper concluded by saying that it is time for those countries criticized by President Sukarno to change their outdated attitudes.

### 苏加诺在上海主张太平洋各国缔结互不侵犯公约  印度尼西亚报纸认为符合万隆精神

    苏加诺在上海主张太平洋各国缔结互不侵犯公约
    印度尼西亚报纸认为符合万隆精神
    新华社雅加达13日电　印度尼西亚“共和国报”今天说：苏加诺总统在上海群众的欢迎大会上所提出的关于由太平洋区域各国缔结一项互不侵犯公约的建议，是符合万隆精神的。这家报纸又说，甚至可以认为这种建议就是万隆精神的产物。
    这家报纸说：自从美国和英国在这个区域成立东南亚条约组织以来，亚非国家领袖们一直认为有必要建立互相信任来击败西方国家所采取的“亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策。缔结这种互不侵犯公约就可以增加亚非国家之间的互相信任，使它们有可能削减国防经费而把力量集中在经济建设方面。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”说：苏加诺总统的建议提得很好，值得有关国家认真考虑。这家报纸说，这是关于实现世界持久和平的主要建议，因为它里面不包含任何的歧视。
    “万隆新闻”在10月12日指出所谓不应该承认中华人民共和国并且应该把它排斥在联合国以外的那种谰言，再也没有人爱听了。它说，正像苏加诺总统在上海所说的那样，谁坚持这种谰言，谁就会被汹涌澎湃的反殖民主义和反帝国主义的浪潮所淹没。
    这家报纸还说：苏加诺总统在上海群众大会上所讲的话可能使西方国家、特别是美国最感不愉快。但是问题不在于愉快或者不愉快，而在于谁也不能再对这种客观现实有所异议了。
    这家报纸强调说：印度尼西亚所以希望同中国友好，只是由于它希望同所有的国家友好。这并不意味着印度尼西亚反对不承认中国的国家。报纸最后说，现在已经是苏加诺总统所批评的那些国家改变它们的不合潮流的态度的时候了。
