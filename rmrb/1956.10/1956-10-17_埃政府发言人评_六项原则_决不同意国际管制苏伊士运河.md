Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 16th. The Egyptian government spokesman commented on the six principles adopted by the United Nations Security Council regarding continued negotiations on the Suez Canal issue on the 15th, saying: International management of the Suez Canal would undermine Egypt's sovereignty, and Egypt would never agree to any interference in its internal affairs. The second of the six principles, regarding respect for Egyptian sovereignty, already mentions this point.

The spokesman said that Egypt has repeatedly reaffirmed the guarantee of freedom of navigation in the canal, which is mentioned in the first of the six principles.

The spokesman added that the third of the six principles, regarding the operation of the canal being independent of the politics of any country, reflects the views that Egypt has clarified before the Security Council and the so-called "Five-Nation Committee on the Suez Canal." The spokesman pointed out that Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi stated in his speech to the Security Council that the best way to solve the Suez issue is to conclude a new international agreement confirming or replacing the 1888 Convention. All other solutions would be detrimental to Egypt's sovereignty.

The spokesman said that the fourth and fifth of the six principles, concerning the payment of canal tolls and future development, are in line with Egypt's position. Egypt agrees to international cooperation but does not agree to international control. This cooperation should be realized between the Egyptian Canal Authority and the canal-using countries. He also said that Egypt agrees to the sixth principle regarding arbitration in a spirit of reconciliation.

    埃政府发言人评“六项原则”
    决不同意国际管制苏伊士运河
    新华社16日讯　开罗消息：埃及政府发言人15日评论联合国安全理事会通过的关于苏伊士运河问题继续进行谈判的六项原则说：对苏伊士运河的国际管理会损害埃及的主权，埃及无论如何决不同意对它的内政进行任何干涉。六项原则中关于尊重埃及主权的第二项已经提到了这一点。
    这位发言人说，埃及曾经再三重申保障运河的通航自由，这是在六项原则的第一项中谈到的。
    发言人又说，六项原则中关于运河的经营将不同任何国家的政治发生关系的第三项，反映了埃及在安全理事会和在所谓“苏伊士运河五国委员会”面前阐明过的观点。发言人指出，埃及外交部长法齐在安全理事会的发言中已经说明，解决苏伊士问题的最好办法是缔结一项确认或者代替1888年公约的新的国际协定。其他一切解决办法都会是有损埃及的主权的。
    发言人说，六项原则中有关运河通行费的支付和今后发展的第四项和第五项是符合于埃及的立场的。埃及同意国际合作，但不同意国际管制。埃及运河管理当局和运河使用国之间应当实现这种合作。他又说，埃及抱着和解的精神同意关于仲裁的第六点原则。
