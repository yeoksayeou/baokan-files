Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 27th - Hong Kong dispatch: Guangzhou Steel Window Manufacturing Co., Ltd. and Oriental Soy Sauce and Canned Food Co., Ltd., who suffered looting by Kuomintang secret agents during the Kowloon riots, recently wrote to the Hong Kong Chinese Manufacturers' Association, hoping that the association would convey to the Hong Kong British authorities the need to effectively protect the safety of residents and industrialists and businessmen in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

    The letter from Guangzhou Steel Window Manufacturing Co., Ltd. stated: Before the incident occurred, the company's responsible person telegraphed the police requesting them to send police to protect the factory, but the rioters acted wantonly in broad daylight, which is regrettable. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will apprehend the rioters as soon as possible and do their best to recover the stolen goods, so that industrialists can feel that their lives and property are fully protected. The letter from Oriental Soy Sauce and Canned Food Co., Ltd. calls on the relevant Hong Kong authorities to bring the rioters to justice and punish them according to the law.

    九龙受国民党特务劫掠的工商业者
    要求香港英国当局保证安全
    新华社广州27日电　香港消息：在九龙暴乱中曾遭受国民党特务劫掠的广州钢窗制造有限公司和东方酱油罐头有限公司，最近分别写信给香港中华厂商联合会，希望该会转达香港英国当局，切实保障港九居民和工商业家的安全。
    广州钢窗制造有限公司的信里说：当日事发之先，公司负责人曾电告警方请求派警保护工厂，而暴徒竟于光天化日之下为所欲为，殊属遗憾。希望有关当局早日追缉暴徒，并尽力追还赃物，然后办工业者始能感到其生命财产获得充分保障。东方酱油罐头有限公司的信里呼吁香港有关当局，务将暴徒缉捕归案法办。
