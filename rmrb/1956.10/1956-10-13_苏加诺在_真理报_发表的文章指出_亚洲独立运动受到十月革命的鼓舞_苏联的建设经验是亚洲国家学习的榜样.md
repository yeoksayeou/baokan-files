Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 11th: President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia said that the Asian people's movement for independence was greatly inspired by the October Revolution.

    "Pravda" published an article by Sukarno today, saying that the awakening of the Asian people, who are everywhere launching struggles to gain independence and liberation from the oppression of Western aggressors, is a historical event of extremely great significance. The struggle of the people of Asian countries for national independence and the construction of a rational and prosperous society is influenced by the struggles carried out by the people of other countries. During the period of overthrowing the colonial regimes of Western countries, the Russian October Revolution of 1917 broke out, sweeping across Eastern Europe.

    Sukarno wrote that at the time of the October Revolution, the Russian people pointed out to the Asian countries struggling against colonialist oppression that, despite the cruel rule of feudalism represented by the Tsarist autocracy at the time, the working class was able to overthrow such a powerful regime and establish their ideal new society. This was the greatest historical event, which inspired the Asian people who were striving for national independence, strengthened their confidence, and made them believe that as long as they carried out the struggle in an organized and extremely determined manner, they would also achieve final victory in the just struggle.

    Sukarno said that after the victory of the October Revolution in Russia, the struggle of the Asian people for national independence and against the oppression of aggressors unfolded more vigorously. Inspired by the October Revolution, the Asian people more actively re-established their national strength in order to strike a heavy blow at the colonial authorities when the opportune moment arose. This opportune moment came at the end of World War II when the imperialist regimes were particularly weakened. After World War II, a number of independent Asian countries were born.

    Sukarno then pointed out that Asia is now in the stage of establishing its own national economy. The Soviet Union eliminated the old feudal agricultural society and established a new society based on a high level of technological development. Its construction experience is also very important for the Asian people. The Soviet Union has many construction experiences that can be drawn on as learning models. After carefully analyzing the Soviet Union's construction experience and applying these experiences according to the specific conditions of each Asian country, there is no doubt that these experiences are beneficial to the construction cause of Asian countries.

    苏加诺在“真理报”发表的文章指出
    亚洲独立运动受到十月革命的鼓舞
    苏联的建设经验是亚洲国家学习的榜样
    新华社莫斯科11日电　印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺说：亚洲人民争取独立的运动受到了十月革命的极大鼓舞。
    “真理报”今天刊出苏加诺的一篇文章说：到处掀起争取从西方侵略者的压迫下获得独立和解放的斗争的亚洲人民的觉醒，是具有极其重大的意义的历史事件。亚洲各国人民争取民族独立和建设一个合理的、繁荣的社会的斗争，受到其他各国人民所进行的斗争的影响。在推翻西方国家殖民政权的斗争时期中，席卷欧洲东部的俄国1917年十月革命爆发了。
    苏加诺写道，在十月革命的时候，俄国人民向反对殖民主义压迫的亚洲各国人民指出，尽管当时有沙皇专制政体所代表的封建主义的残酷统治，工人阶级能够推翻这样强大的政权而建立他们理想的新社会。这是件最伟大的历史事件，它鼓舞了争取民族独立的亚洲人民，加强了他们的信心，使他们相信，只要他们有组织地并且极其坚决地进行斗争，他们在正义斗争中也会获得最后胜利。
    苏加诺说，在俄国十月革命取得胜利以后，亚洲人民争取民族独立、反对侵略者压迫的斗争更加有力地展开了。受十月革命鼓舞的亚洲人民更加积极地重新建立自己的民族力量，以便在一旦需要的时机猛击殖民当局。这个适当的时机在第二次世界大战结束时帝国主义政权特别削弱的时候到来了。第二次世界大战以后，一批独立的亚洲国家诞生了。
    苏加诺接着指出，亚洲现在正处在建立自己的民族经济的阶段。苏联消灭了旧的封建的农业社会，建立了以高度的技术发展水平为基础的新社会，它的建设经验对亚洲人民来说也是十分重要的。苏联有许多建设经验是可以吸取来作为学习的榜样的。在仔细分析了苏联的建设经验、并且根据每个亚洲国家的具体条件对这些经验加以运用以后，毫无疑问就可以看出，这些经验对于亚洲国家的建设事业是有益的。
