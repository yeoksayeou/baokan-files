    On the Results of the British Labour Party Annual Conference
    By Alan Winnington, Correspondent for the British "Daily Worker"
    The Labour Party's annual conference, which has just concluded, marks a significant step forward in the struggle to bring down the Conservative government and replace it with a new Labour government with a broader mass base than ever before.
    With the conference voting in favor of a peaceful resolution to the Suez Canal issue and electing Bevan to the important position of Treasurer, leading to the defeat of the Labour Party's right-wing leadership, the question is now being asked: Does this mean that cooperation between the Labour and Conservative parties on foreign policy is over, that the Labour Party has adopted a more progressive domestic policy, and that it has abandoned the line of class cooperation that violates the interests of the working class? Naturally, it does not mean such consequences. However, certain changes have indeed taken place in the British labor movement, changes that could lead to new victories for the people and enable Britain to play a more peaceful role in international affairs.
    For generations, the right wing of the labor movement has been in a dominant position. It has always kept the trade unions and the Labour Party trailing behind the bourgeoisie and has led the working class to support, or at least acquiesce in, the policies of British imperialism. For the past few decades, the militant trade union and Labour Party left wing has tried in vain to break through the power of the right wing, which has controlled everything through "bloc voting" in the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party, the Labour Party being the political wing of the trade unions.
    The enthusiastic cheers for Bevan (who was expelled by the Labour Party's right wing less than two years ago) were not entirely for him personally; certainly not for any policies that could be seen as endorsed or consistently supported by him; but because his victory was a defeat for the right wing and a victory for the rank and file of the Labour Party. This cheering expressed the masses' desire to cast off those leaders who persist in undermining unity and betraying the heroic actions of the rank and file in their struggle for a better life and peace.
    Bevan was elected by a coalition of progressive trade unions and progressive individual Labour Party members. His election was one of the most important events of the conference, at which the right-wing leaders were unable to restrain the left wing on a number of major issues. The left wing embodies the growing dissatisfaction of the British public with the reactionary domestic and foreign policies that are plunging Britain into ever-deeper difficulties.
    The Labour Party leaders are not strong enough to stop this development; they have had to give way to this pressure and try to divert the direction of the movement.
    The Labour Party is based on and influenced by trade unions. Therefore, it reflects to a considerable extent the distinct fighting spirit of the Trades Union Congress annual conference held a few weeks ago. Both conferences reflect the increasing leftward trend of the British public.
    This situation has been caused by the disastrous policies of the Eden government, which have led Britain from one crisis to another, culminating in the Suez issue, which brought Britain to the brink of war. While increased rents and higher prices (today, four loaves of bread cost the same as seven in 1951) place a heavier burden on the masses, the wealthy squander money on lavish banquets, and the nation's wealth is concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer people. Automation, which could produce more goods for all the people, is being used to make even greater profits and is causing serious unemployment.
    As a result, a series of strikes have broken out, particularly in the automobile industry and against rent increases. These strikes, just before the Trades Union Congress convened, formed a vast mass movement against Eden's belligerent actions, which aroused great anger throughout the country. In all these formal and informal mass movements, Communists, Labour Party members, and trade union members have played an important role in the struggle.
    Therefore, the Trades Union Congress and Labour Party annual conferences were convened at a very tense time, and for those concerned, at a meaningful time. The leaders of Britain's largest trade union – the Transport and General Workers' Union – often have considerable influence on the British labor movement. This union used to be a bastion of the far right, led by Bevin and Deakin. Since they have both passed away, there has been much speculation as to what course their successor, Frank Cousins, will take. Will he follow in their reactionary footsteps, or will he represent the demands of the rank and file?
    In fact, Cousins put forward an important motion to the Trades Union Congress, leading the conference to pass a resolution that workers should never bear the burden of crises created by capitalists, but should fight for increased wages. This resolution was passed unanimously, which is unusual on such issues.
    This spirit of unity was further developed when a Communist leader representing electrical workers proposed a motion that full employment should be maintained during the transition to automation in factories. This proposal was seconded by the right-wing National Union of Municipal and General Workers and was also passed unanimously.
    These developments of unity and a turn to the left in trade union organizations strongly suggest to the right-wing leaders that if they remain in their original positions, the masses will cast them aside and accept other leaders. During the Suez Canal crisis, Labour Party leader Gaitskell shouted almost as loudly as Eden, demanding the freezing of Egyptian assets and other economic sanctions against Egypt.
    However, it soon became clear that the British public had little interest in such warmongering clamor; so Gaitskell had to change his course. The entire right wing was forced to make concessions. These concessions were reluctant and as minimal as possible.
    Such Labour Party leaders are adept at deceiving ordinary members. However, they found it much more difficult this time than in the past. Nevertheless, they did their best to stifle resolutions representing genuine opinion, primarily by preventing ordinary members from taking action.
    In this situation, the most important thing was that the conference agreed that the Suez Canal issue must be resolved peacefully. However, although a resolution condemning colonialism was passed, the leadership opposed the electrical workers' proposal to withdraw all troops from the colonies and rejected it. The conference passed a large-scale housing program – a program on paper – but on the real issue of rent, the leadership endorsed the Conservative government's policy.
    On international issues, the conference also passed some progressive resolutions on disarmament, the banning of atomic weapons, and efforts to resolve European security. However, the leadership strongly opposed contact with the Communist parties of other countries in the interests of peace and rejected proposals in this regard.
    On some issues, when there was hesitation and vacillation, the reactionaries were able to seize the opportunity, while when the masses' attitude was clear, the right wing was divided, and the masses triumphed. The masses' attitude was very clear when electing the executive committee.
    Bevan was elected against the highly organized opposition of the executive committee. All those who supported Bevan were re-elected to the executive committee. Left-wingers such as Sydney Silverman were also re-elected. If the representatives of the Amalgamated Engineering Union had voted for Bevan according to the wishes of the union's rank and file, then Bevan's victory would have been even greater, with an absolute majority of 270,000 votes.
    Many Conservatives in London are already discussing the danger of Bevan ousting Gaitskell from the leadership position, the possibility of a left-wing movement within the Labour Party being launched in some way, and even the emergence of a Labour Party left-wing government led by Bevan. Bevan has refused to say whether he will challenge Gaitskell for the party leadership. In any case, this is not a matter between individuals. If Bevan tries to gain the leadership of the Labour Party by leaning to the right, he will certainly fail.
    Bevan himself remains an enigma, because he is fickle and has no set policies. Whenever he attacks the right wing, he inevitably attacks the left wing as well. He was jointly nominated by militant trade unions and the Labour Party left wing; but what will happen in the future remains to be seen.
    Regardless of what Bevan does in the future, the forces that broke through the power of the right wing to elect him, the forces that almost completely reversed the Labour Party leaders' policies on the Suez issue, and forced them to retreat defensively on almost every issue, still exist and continue to grow.
    What needs to be done in the future is to mobilize these forces into action to further advance domestic and foreign policies. For this, the Communists and other progressive forces in the labor movement need to take concerted action.
    The Communist Party and the "Daily Worker" played a major role in the mass movements, in the strikes, in the movements against rent increases, and against warmongering over the Suez Canal issue. These movements are reflected in the fighting spirit shown by the two annual conferences. Whether Bevan is willing to admit it or not, the fact is that he was elected in no small part thanks to those militants whom he has always attacked. No matter what Bevan does, these militants and the British people will still exist. If he and his colleagues cannot or will not lead this force that has risen up, smashed through the old leadership barriers, and is more united than before, then the British labor movement has many other trustworthy, excellent, and brave leaders.
    To drive out the Conservatives and break the curse of British colonialism and reactionaries, it requires the full force of a united labor movement, which cannot be achieved by a centrist who sits back and reaps the benefits of attacks between the left and right wings.
    It can be said that the Labour Party's annual conference has turned to the left. To some extent, it reflects the wishes of the masses. It has contributed to the cause of peace on the Suez issue and in general. It has led to more lasting unity among the militant trade union organizations and progressive forces within the Labour Party. It shows that the right wing is no longer able to obstruct progressive action.
    Therefore, although there will still be many struggles and setbacks in the future, this is a major step towards unity. This unity can drive the Conservative Party out of power and establish a government that represents the British people.

    论英国工党年会的结果
    英国“工人日报”记者　阿兰·魏宁顿
    刚刚闭幕的工党年会标志着让保守党政府下台而由一个比以往具有更广泛的群众基础的新工党政府上台的斗争，迈进了重大的一步。
    由于大会表决赞成和平解决苏伊士运河问题，并选举比万担任司库的重要职务，使工党右翼领导归于失败，于是人们正在提出这样的问题：这是不是意味着工党和保守党在外交方面的合作已经完结，工党已采取了比较进步的国内政策并已放弃了违反工人阶级利益的阶级合作的路线呢？这自然不是意味着这种后果。但是，英国的工人运动中的确已经发生了某些变化，这些变化能够导向人民的新的胜利，并使英国在国际事务中扮演一个比较和平的角色。
    多少代以来，工人运动的右翼始终居于统治地位。它一直使工会和工党跟在资产阶级的后面，并且使工人阶级支持或者至少是默认英帝国主义的政策。过去几十年中，富于战斗性的工会和工党左翼曾经徒然地企图突破右翼的势力，这种势力是凭借会员众多的工会在职工大会和工党内进行“团体投票”来控制一切的。而工党则是工会的政治上的一翼。
    对比万（他在不到两年前曾被工党右翼所驱逐）的当选的热烈欢呼，并不完全是对他本人而发；当然也不是向任何可以看作是他所认可的或一贯支持的政策欢呼；而是因为他的胜利是右翼的一次失败和工党党员群众的胜利。这个欢呼表达了群众的愿望：抛掉那些坚持破坏团结并出卖党员群众争取美好生活和和平的英勇行动的领袖们。
    比万是由加入工党的进步工会和进步的个人党员结成的联盟选举出来的。他的当选是会议的一个最重要的事件，在这个会议上右翼领袖们没有能够在一些重大的问题上约束左翼。左翼体现了英国公众对反动的国内外政策的日益增长的不满，这些政策正在使英国陷入越来越深的困难之中。
    工党领袖们已没有力量来制止这种发展，他们不得不向这个压力让步并设法转移这个运动的方向。
    工党是以职工会为基础的，并且是受职工会的影响的。因此，它在相当程度上反映了几个星期前举行的职工大会年会上的鲜明的战斗精神。这两个会议都反映了英国公众日益左倾的趋势。
    这种情况是艾登政府的灾难性的政策所造成的。这个政策引导英国从一个危机走向另一个危机，最后在苏伊士问题上把英国引向战争的边缘。当增加租金和提高物价（今天四个面包的价格等于1951年七个面包的价格），把更重的负担压在人民群众身上的同时，富豪们却在豪华的宴会上挥金如土，而国家的财富集中在越来越少的人手中。原可以为全体人民生产更多物品的自动化，正被用来谋取更大的利润，并造成严重的失业。
    结果爆发了一系列的罢工，特别是汽车工业的罢工和对房租的罢工。这些罢工正好在职工大会开会之前形成了一个反对艾登好战行动的浩大的群众运动，这些好战行动在全国引起了极大的愤怒。在所有这些正式的或非正式的群众运动中，共产党员和工党党员以及工会会员一起，在斗争中起了重要的作用。
    因此，职工大会和工党年会都是在一个非常紧张的时期、而对有关的人来说也是在一个具有意义的时期里召开的。英国最大的工会——运输与不熟练工人工会的领袖们对英国工人运动经常有相当大的影响。这个工会曾经是以贝文和狄金为首的极右翼的堡垒。由于这些人都已去世，人们对于他们的继承者弗兰克·卡逊斯会采取什么路线诸多猜测。他将会步他们的反动的后尘呢，还是将会代表会员群众的要求呢？
    事实上，卡逊斯向职工大会提出一个重要议案，导致大会作出一项决议：工人们绝不承担资本家所制造的危机，而是要为增加工资而斗争。这个决议获得一致通过，这是在这类问题上发生的不寻常的事情。
    当代表电气工人的一位共产党领导人提出一项在工厂过渡到采用自动化的期间应保持充分就业的议案的时候，这种团结一致的精神获得了进一步的发展。这个提案得到右翼工会——全国市政与普通工人联合会的附议，并且也获得一致通过。
    工会组织中的这些团结起来向左转的发展，向右翼领袖强烈地暗示：如果他们还是站在原来的立场上，群众就会撇开他们而接受别的领导者。在苏伊士运河危机发展时期，工党领袖盖次克尔几乎和艾登同样大声叫喊，要求冻结埃及资产，和对埃及采取其他经济制裁。
    但是，情况很快就显示出，英国公众对于这类黩武主义的叫嚣一点兴趣也没有；于是，盖次克尔不得不改变他的路线。整个右翼被迫让步。这些让步是很勉强的，而且是尽可能少作让步的。
    这类工党领袖是擅长于欺骗一般党员的。但是，他们发现这一回要比以往难得多了。然而，他们还是尽力扼杀代表真正意见的决议，首先是防止一般党员采取行动。
    在这种情况下，最重要的是，大会同意了苏伊士运河问题一定要和平解决。可是，虽然通过了一个谴责殖民主义的决议，但领导集团反对电气工人提出的从殖民地撤退全部驻军的提案，并否决了这个提案。大会通过了一个大规模的房屋方案——一个纸上的方案，可是，在现实的房租问题上，领导集团却认可了保守党政府的政策。
    在国际问题上，大会也就裁军、禁止原子武器和努力解决欧洲安全等问题通过了一些进步的决议。可是，领导集团极力反对为了和平的利益和其他国家的共产党进行接触，并把这方面的议案否决了。
    在一些问题上，出现动摇和犹豫时，反动派就有机可乘，而当群众态度明确时，右翼就出现分歧，群众就胜利了。选举执行委员会时，群众的态度就是很明确的。
    比万是在执行委员会很有组织的反对下当选的。所有支持比万的人都被重新选进了执行委员会。左翼的悉尼·锡尔弗曼等人也重新当选。如果机器制造业工会的代表们按照了该工会基层会员的愿望也投比万的票的话，那末，比万以二十七万绝对多数票而当选，胜利将会是更大。
    伦敦的保守党人士中已经有不少的人在议论：比万把盖次克尔从领导地位上排挤掉的危险、将会以某种方式发动一个工党的左翼运动、甚至于出现一个由比万领导的工党左翼政府。比万拒绝表示他是否会向盖次克尔挑战，争夺党的领导权。不管怎样，这不是一个个人之间的问题。如果比万企图用倒向右边的办法来取得工党的领导权，那末他一定会遭到失败。
    比万这个人还是一个谜，因为他是反复无常的，而且他并没有任何既定的政策。每当他攻击右翼的时候，他必然同时也攻击左翼。他是由富有战斗性的工会和工党左翼联合推举上台的；但今后会发生什么事情，尚待分晓。
    不论比万今后怎么做，那些突破右翼势力而选举了他的力量，那些几乎把工党领袖们对苏伊士问题的政策完全扭转过来，并迫使他们几乎在每一个问题上都退居守势的力量，仍然存在着并且继续发展着。
    今后所要做的事是调动这些力量投入行动，以便进一步把国内外政策更推前一步。为此，就需要共产党人和工人运动中其他的进步势力采取一致的行动。
    共产党和“工人日报”在群众运动中，在罢工，反对加租，反对在苏伊士运河问题上的战争叫嚣的运动中，都起了很大作用。这些运动反映在两个年会所表现的战斗精神上。不管比万是否愿意承认，事实上他之所以当选，在不小的程度上是靠那些一向受他攻击的战斗者的。不管比万会做些什么，这些战斗者和英国人民将仍会存在。如果他和他的同僚们不能或不愿领导这个已经起来冲垮了旧领导壁垒并且比从前更团结的力量，那么英国的工人运动还有着许多可信赖的优秀的勇敢的领袖。
    要赶跑保守党，要击破英国殖民主义和反动派这个灾星，就需要一个团结的工人运动的全副力量，这不是一个坐收左、右翼互相攻击之渔利的中间派所能做到的。
    可以说，工党年会是向左转了。在某种程度上它反映了群众的愿望。它在苏伊士问题和一般问题上对和平事业作出了贡献。它是使工党内战斗的工会组织和进步力量走向更加持久的团结。它表明右翼不再能够阻挠进步的行动了。
    因此，虽然未来仍将有许多斗争和挫折，这已是向团结迈出一大步。这种团结能够将保守党赶下台去并且建立一个代表英国人民的政府。
