　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 9th: Budapest dispatch: The funeral of Rajk, Pálffy, Szőnyi, and Szalai was held in Budapest on October 6th. Approximately 150,000 workers, intellectuals, officers, and soldiers marched past the coffins of Rajk and others, which were placed in front of the mausoleum of the Hungarian national hero Kossuth.
    Rajk, Pálffy, Szőnyi, and Szalai were falsely accused in 1949 of being foreign spies and engaging in treasonous activities, and were sentenced to death. Rajk, Pálffy, and Szőnyi were former members of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, and Szalai was a former minister of the Central Committee.
    At the funeral, Apór, a leader of the Hungarian Working People's Party, delivered a speech on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the Council of Ministers. He said that we have demanded, and will continue to demand, that those who hold important responsibilities in the party and state leadership organs be held accountable for violations of the law. The Party firmly believes that greater participation of the working people in leadership regarding socialist democracy in social development and public life will ensure that violations of the law never happen again.
    Apór concluded by speaking about the glorious path of these four martyrs of the workers' movement, and guaranteed in the name of the Central Committee to strengthen the unity of the Party.

　　布达佩斯举行拉伊克等的葬礼
    新华社布拉格9日电　布达佩斯消息：拉伊克、帕菲尔、瑟尼和萨拉伊的葬礼10月6日在布达佩斯举行。大约有十五万名工人、知识分子、军官和士兵列队走过安放在匈牙利民族英雄科苏特陵墓前面的拉伊克等人的灵柩。
    拉伊克、帕菲尔、瑟尼和萨拉伊是在1949年被诬告为外国间谍、从事叛国活动而被处死刑的。拉伊克、帕菲尔和瑟尼是匈牙利劳动人民党前中央委员会委员，萨拉伊是前中央委员会的一个部长。
    在举行葬礼的时候，匈牙利劳动人民党领导人阿普罗代表党中央委员会和部长会议致词。他说，我们曾经要求过，而且将继续要求在党和国家领导机构负重要责任的人对违反法制的行为负责。党坚决认为，更多的劳动人民在有关社会发展和公共生活中的社会主义民主的问题上参加领导就能保证永远不再发生破坏法制的事情。
    阿普罗最后谈到这四位工人运动的烈士的光辉道路，并且以中央委员会的名义保证加强党的团结。
