Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 21st: Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po newspaper today published a report from four trade unions in Hong Kong and Kowloon that jointly hosted a press conference to denounce the atrocities committed by Kuomintang secret agents in the Tsuen Wan riots. The four trade unions are the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile Dyeing and Weaving Workers' General Union, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Enamelware Trade Union, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Silk Weaving Trade Union, and the Hong Kong and Kowloon Rubber Trade Union. The reception was jointly held at 8:00 PM on the 20th in the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions auditorium. More than 200 trade union representatives and reporters from various newspapers attended the reception.

At the beginning of the reception, all attendees stood up in unison to observe a moment of silence in mourning for the workers and compatriots who died in the riots. Then, Huang Yanfang, chairman of the Textile Dyeing and Weaving Workers' Union, reported on the attacks suffered by each union from rioters gathered by Kuomintang secret agents, as well as the losses incurred. During her report, she was filled with grief and indignation, and she choked with sobs several times when reporting on the brutal killings and beatings of fellow workers.

Several workers who were severely beaten by Kuomintang secret agents in Tsuen Wan also reported on their experiences of being victimized at the meeting. Li Sheng, vice chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, and representatives from various trade unions also spoke at the meeting, denouncing the atrocities committed by Kuomintang secret agents.

The full joint report of the four trade unions of Textile Dyeing, Enamel, Silk Weaving, and Rubber is as follows:

(I) The Course of the Atrocities

At around 3:00 PM on October 11th, groups of three to five rioters had already appeared in the Tsuen Wan urban area. At 6:00 PM, citizens were alarmed by news that a large number of rioters were descending on Tsuen Wan from Fu Yung Shan, and the situation was very tense. At around 7:00 PM, a large number of rioters holding Kuomintang flags and various sharp weapons arrived at the Tsuen Wan Medical Clinic of the Federation of Trade Unions in Muk Min Ha Village. The leader said, "This is it!" and threw large stones from both sides into the medical clinic, then tried to climb upstairs with ladders, and then tried to set fire to the bamboo shed in front of the medical clinic. The workers guarding the medical clinic resolutely resisted and blocked the rioters, while also extinguishing the fire. At that time, the medical clinic staff repeatedly called the fire department and the police station for assistance, but to no avail. After more than two hours of resistance, many of the workers guarding the medical clinic had been injured, but they continued to hold their ground. However, the rioters managed to climb onto the roof, using hoes to open the tiled surface and throwing down large stones. At this point, the situation was beyond control, and the rioters descended from the broken holes in the tiles with ladders and rushed into the medical clinic. They brutally beat the workers and medical clinic staff, and two female staff members of the medical clinic were forcibly stripped naked and sexually assaulted by the rioters, and forced to walk on the street, and were then beaten severely and collapsed to the ground. The residents of Tsuen Wan were filled with outrage and hatred for the rioters' inhuman crimes, and could not bear to witness them.

After the rioters destroyed the medical clinic, their ferocity increased, and they turned to attack the Tsuen Wan Service Department of the Textile Dyeing and Weaving Workers' Union and the Tsuen Wan Book Station of the Workers' Library. In addition to throwing stones, they also burned dense smoke up to the upper floors and threatened to set fire to the building. Soon, the rioters broke into the service department. These workers were forced onto the street under the threat of the rioters, and most of them were dragged to the front of the Red Lotus Bakery in front of the Tsuen Wan Bridge and brutally beaten, slashed with knives, and struck with iron tools, and their clothes were stripped off and their watches and valuables were looted. When the workers were beaten and lying on the street, one of the rioters even checked the pulse of a worker, and when he found that there was still a pulse, he called for the rioters to beat him again. When some workers groaned in pain, the rioters said, "Still smiling!" and smashed them with large stones, determined to kill them. Later, the rioters threw burning firecrackers on the workers, and beat them again if they found any reaction. Some rioters even wanted to pour gasoline on the workers to burn them, but they were stopped by the Tsuen Wan residents present.

At almost the same time, a large number of rioters, led by Kuomintang secret agents holding Kuomintang flags, wearing white shirts and blue shorts, and wearing white handkerchiefs on their arms, attacked the Silk Weaving Trade Union on Castle Peak Road in Tsuen Wan. At 7:00 PM, they began throwing stones, and a whistle signaled the charge. The workers in the union hall resolutely resisted, not allowing the rioters to enter. The rioters failed to attack from the ground, so they attacked the union hall from a rooftop several houses away from the union, but because the iron wire mesh was very high and the wire was very thick, and the workers resolutely fought back, they still could not break in. As a result, the rioters were enraged and threw fireballs into the union hall to set it on fire, and cut the iron wire mesh, rushed into the union hall, threw things onto the street to burn, dragged the workers downstairs, beat them with thick iron rods, and pushed the workers into the fire. Worker Liang Hongguang was burned alive on the spot. At the same time, another group of rioters was also systematically moving the union's property away, then setting fire to the building, and then planting the symbol of their atrocities—the Kuomintang flag—at the entrance of the union hall!

At 7:30 PM, another group of four secret agents sneaked into the Tsuen Wan branch of the Enamelware Trade Union, shouting wildly: "Hey, hang the Blue Sky White Sun flag! If you don't hang it, we'll beat you and set it on fire!" The enamelware workers in the union hall were extremely resentful of the provocation of these secret agents. At 7:45 PM, a large number of rioters led by these secret agents surrounded the branch, first attacking the back of the union hall, but were repelled by the workers, so they turned to attacking with stones, but could not subdue the workers. They persisted until 9:15 PM, when the rioters surrounded the rooftop from three sides, and even nearby houses were forcibly occupied as strongholds. At 9:30 PM, the heinous rioters threw explosives into the union hall three times, and threw fireballs into the union hall to set it on fire. As a result, the rioters occupied the rooftop, but the workers still desperately defended the union hall, and most of them were injured. Finally, at about 10:00 PM, the rioters rushed into the union hall, looted all the workers' clothes and property, and escorted the workers to the front of the Red Lotus Bakery to beat them. On the way, some workers took the opportunity to escape, and the other workers were told by the bandits that they would be beaten to death. It was already after 11:00 PM in the late night when military vehicles arrived, and these workers were lucky to be rescued.

The rioters' riotous behavior was not only in the Tsuen Wan urban area. On the same afternoon, at around 4:00 PM, they also attacked many places near the area in an organized and planned manner, including the Bao Xing Yarn Factory, the Nanhai Yarn Factory, the Kowloon Yarn Factory, the Wheelock Marden Yarn Factory, the Southeast Yarn Factory, the Da Hing Rubber Factory workers' dormitory, and the Tsuen Wan Workers' Service Department of the Rubber Trade Union, all targeting unarmed workers.

At 4:00 PM, a group of rioters wearing black clothes and trousers with white cloths tied around their arms and holding three- or four-foot-long iron rods began to surround the Bao Xing Yarn Factory. In the evening, the "free laborers" inside the factory opened the iron gate and led the rioters in, driving the workers out of the dormitory and singling them out for violent beatings. Some workers were beaten more than ten times, severely injured and collapsed to the ground, on the verge of death. Three female workers were pushed onto the road, some were stripped naked, and subjected to wanton abuse. These rioters also vandalized the factory and threatened the factory to agree to dismiss the good workers and require the "free trade union" to select employees for future recruitment and other absurd conditions.

At around 6:00 PM, a group of "free laborers" led rioters to attack the Rubber Service Department near the Bao Xing Yarn Factory, injuring one worker and chasing after other workers, and looting all the property in the service department. Later, this group of rioters attacked the Da Hing Rubber Factory dormitory, and the rioters' leader, holding a list, singled out and injured many workers who were resting.

On the same night, hundreds of rioters gathered outside the Southeast Yarn Factory, demanding that the factory open the door, otherwise they would break into the factory. We, the more than sixty workers in the factory, demanded that the factory not open the door, while also stepping up our self-defense preparations. The rioters entered the factory at around 10:00 PM, but because the workers held firmly to the workshop and refused to yield, the rioters, although shouting and killing, could do nothing. These workers were able to leave collectively only after 8:00 AM the next morning. On the same day, the rioters also besieged the Nanhai Yarn Factory. The workers in the dormitory were unprepared and outnumbered, and after resisting, some of the workers escaped, but some of the female workers could not escape, and their situation is still unknown.

In this Tsuen Wan massacre, the ×× Gold Shop, the ×× Barber Shop, and other establishments were also robbed by the rioters. Residents were forced to hang the Kuomintang flag and forced to set off firecrackers. For several days, all the factories in the Tsuen Wan district were shut down, shops were closed, schools were closed, medical clinics stopped operating, and the lives and property of residents were directly threatened. The losses in those few days could not be fully accounted for for a time, but the residents of the Tsuen Wan district recognized the crimes of the Kuomintang secret agents from this Tsuen Wan riot.

According to the workers' reports, these situations are too terrible and too hateful. There are many more details, but they cannot be described in detail for the time being. From the facts mentioned above, we truly find it hard to believe that, not to mention being fellow Chinese, even just being human beings, it is hard to believe that these secret agents and rioters holding Kuomintang flags and wearing Kuomintang badges could commit such inhuman, heinous atrocities! We, the workers of the four victimized units, like all the workers in Hong Kong, will never, ever forget this unprecedented and cruel blood feud!

(II) The Situation of Workers Who Were Victimized and Died, Were Injured, or Went Missing

In the massacre caused by the Tsuen Wan riots, our good workers were brutally beaten, tortured, humiliated, and looted everywhere. To date, it has not been possible to obtain a nearly accurate and complete number. Here, we only list some preliminary situations reflected by the victimized workers and eyewitnesses.

1. Workers who have been confirmed dead: Textile Dyeing: Zhao Zhenxiang, Yu Songjin, Yang Zhu; Silk Weaving: Liang Hongguang, Lai Boliang; Medical Clinic: Yang Guanfu.
(Workers who are known to have died but whose bodies have not been seen, workers who recently died in hospitals but have not been formally notified, and workers whose bodies have been seen but cannot be identified have not been included in the list. According to a reliable source, there are many female corpses that are too terrible to look at.)

2. Number of injured workers: Textile Dyeing: Ninety-two people; Silk Weaving: Eight people; Rubber: Twelve people; Enamelware: Forty-six people; Medical Clinic: Five people.
(The above figures are for workers with known injuries, and most of them are seriously injured, with their lives on the line. Many workers were injured and went to the hospital without knowing the situation, or went to the doctor on their own and did not report to the union, and have not been included in the list.)

3. Number of missing workers:
Textile Dyeing: Seven people; Silk Weaving: One person; Enamelware: One person.
(Because many factory workers have not been able to return to work, and some disappeared during or after the incident, the number of missing people is currently impossible to accurately count.)

(III) Losses Suffered by Union and Workers' Property

It has not been possible to make a complete count of this aspect.

The Tsuen Wan Medical Clinic of the Federation of Trade Unions was completely destroyed, and all equipment and medicines were damaged. The estimated loss is more than 10,000 yuan.

The Tsuen Wan Service Department of the Textile Dyeing and Weaving Workers' Union was completely destroyed. All furniture and sundries were smashed to pieces, and all the goods purchased on behalf of the workers stored in the service department were looted, with a loss of about 50,000 yuan.

All the equipment of the Rubber Service Department was destroyed, and the goods were looted, with a loss of about 5,000 yuan.

The Tsuen Wan branch of the Enamelware Trade Union was completely destroyed, with a loss of about 20,000 yuan.

The Silk Weaving Trade Union was completely destroyed, with a loss of more than 30,000 yuan.

In addition, almost all the clothes, watches, pens, and valuables of the workers who were killed or beaten were looted, and it is impossible to calculate the actual figures.

The loss of wages due to the suspension of work due to the riots is still impossible to count.

(IV) Our Accusations

We report the above-mentioned atrocities and the holocaust suffered by our workers with infinite resentment and grief. We cannot but accuse this unprecedented and cruel atrocity!

According to various materials, we, like all compatriots in Hong Kong, fully understand that the Kowloon riots and the Tsuen Wan massacre were entirely organized and planned atrocities committed by Kuomintang secret agents! Hundreds and thousands of workers saw who was directing, who was leading, who was rampant and unscrupulous, killing and beating our workers, who was setting fire and looting. We can recognize many faces and call out many names. Those people thought our workers would be killed, but our workers are so united and strong, and the workers have stubbornly survived, and the murderers will never be able to escape justice!

We plead for the dead and appeal for the injured! We hope that the gentlemen of the press will uphold justice and seek justice for the workers who were killed and injured! We hope that all workers and trade union members will unite to jointly urge the relevant authorities to arrest the masterminds and severely punish the culprits. We hope that the Hong Kong authorities will immediately announce the full list of workers and residents who died in the Tsuen Wan massacre, announce the list of injured people, and quickly and reasonably provide for the aftermath. At the same time, we hope that all workers in Hong Kong will further unite, help each other, care for the dead and support the injured, and work together to protect the safety of the lives and property of all workers and residents in Hong Kong!

    港九纺织、搪瓷、丝织、树胶四个工会
    联合控诉国民党特务的暴行
    看看这些手持国民党旗、身挂国民党徽章的特务分子做出了多么灭绝人性、罪恶滔天的罪行！
    新华社广州21日电　香港文汇报今天登载了港九四个工会联合招待新闻界控诉国民党特务制造荃湾大暴行的一份报告材料。这四个工会是港九纺织染业职工总会、港九搪瓷业总工会、港九丝织业总工会、港九树胶业总工会。招待会是在20日晚八时联合在港九工会联合会礼堂举行的。参加招待会的有各业工会代表及各报记者二百多人。
    招待会开始时，全体与会者一致起立向在暴乱中死难的工人及同胞默念哀悼，接着由纺织染工会主席黄燕芳报告各该会受到国民党特务分子纠集暴徒袭击的经过及所遭受到的损失。她在报告时满怀悲愤，在报告到工友被惨杀被毒打时几度泣不成声。
    有几位在荃湾曾遭国民党特务分子毒打的受害工人也在会上报告了受害经过。港九工会联合会副理事长李生以及各工会的代表都在会上讲了话，指控国民党特务分子制造的暴行。
    纺织染、搪瓷、丝织、树胶四个工会的联合报告全文如下：
    （一）暴行经过
    10月11日下午三时左右，在荃湾市区已经出现三五成群的暴徒，六点钟，市民惊传有大批暴徒从芙蓉山下到荃湾，情势很紧张，七时左右，有大批手执国民党旗和各种利器的暴徒来到木棉下村工联荃湾医疗所。为首的说：“这间啦！”就用大块石头从两旁抛进医疗所，再用梯子想爬上楼上，继则用火烧医疗所前面的竹棚。留守医疗所的工人坚决抵抗，阻击暴徒，同时把火救熄。当时医疗所人员多次打电话给消防队及警署求援，但都没有结果。经过两小时以上的抵抗，留守医疗所内的工人已有多人受伤。但仍继续坚守。可是暴徒竟设法爬到屋顶，用锄头把瓦面锄开，丢下大石，这时情势已无可为力，暴徒从瓦面的破洞随梯而下，冲入了医疗所。把留守工人及医疗所工作人员加以毒打，其中医疗所有两个女工作人员都被暴徒强行脱光衣服，强抱侮辱，并押着在街上行走，复被打的重伤倒地。荃湾乡民对暴徒这种禽兽不如的罪行莫不切齿痛恨，目不忍睹。
    当暴徒破坏了医疗所之后，凶性更张，转攻纺织染荃湾服务部及工人图书馆荃湾图书站。除了掷石以外，还燃浓烟熏到楼上，并扬言要纵火焚烧。不久，暴徒攻进了服务部。这些工友在暴徒的威胁下到了街上，大部被拉到荃湾桥前红莲面包店门前毒打，用刀劈、用铁器敲击，并且被脱去衣服，搜劫手表财物。当工友被打至倒卧街头时，有一个暴徒还替工友验脉，发现还有脉搏又叫暴徒再打，有些工友痛苦呻吟，暴徒就说：“还笑呀！”就用大石砸下去，务求打死为止。后来暴徒又把烧着的炮竹丢到工友身上，发现还有反应的又打。甚至有些暴徒还要倒汽油来烧工友，被在场的荃湾坊众制止。
    在差不多同时，有手执国民党旗帜的特务分子前导，身穿白色衫、蓝短裤，手上扎着白手帕的大批暴徒，向荃湾市区青山道的丝织工会攻击。在七点钟的时候开始掷石，哨子指挥冲锋。在会所内的工友坚决抵抗，不让暴徒冲入。暴徒在地下攻击不成，竟从隔工会数间屋的一个天台上向工会攻击，但因拦隔的铁丝网很高，铁丝很粗，工友又坚决还击，仍然无法攻入。结果暴徒凶性大发，竟用火球投入会所燃烧，并把铁丝网锯断，冲入会所，丢东西到街上焚烧，把工友捉到楼下，用粗铁棍打倒痛击，并把工人推到火堆里烧，工友梁鸿光就是当场被活活烧死的。同时另一批暴徒也在有计划地搬走工会内的财物，再放火烧，然后在会所门口插上了他们暴行的标志——国民党旗！
    七时半，另一批特务分子四人窜至搪瓷工会荃湾分会，大肆叫嚣：“喂，要挂青天白日旗呀！不挂就打，放火烧呀！”在会所中搪瓷工友对这些特务分子的挑衅，极为愤恨，七时三刻，由这些特务分子率领的大批暴徒将分会包围，首先冲击会所后面，被工友击退了，就转用石头袭击，也不能使工友屈服。一直坚持到九时一刻，暴徒从三面包围屋顶连附近的民房也被强占来作据点。九时半，万恶不赦的暴徒竟向工会内投掷爆炸品三次，又用火球抛进工会燃烧，结果暴徒占领了屋顶，工友仍拼死保卫会所，其中已有绝大部分受伤。终于约在十时暴徒冲进会内，把工友的衣服财物劫掠殆尽，并将工友押至红莲饼家前毒打，在途中，有一些工友乘机逃脱，其他被匪徒声言打死为止。这时已是深夜十一时多，刚有军车开到，这些工友才幸而获救。
    暴徒的暴乱行为，并不是只在荃湾市区。同日下午四时许，他们有组织、有计划地进袭附近一带的宝星纱厂、南海纱厂、九龙纱厂、会德丰纱厂、东南纱厂、大行胶厂工人宿舍和树胶工会荃湾工友服务部很多处，也是指向手无寸铁的工友。
    下午四时，身穿黑色衣裤手束白布、拿着三四尺长铁棍的暴徒一批，开始包围了宝星纱厂。到晚上，厂内的“自由劳工”把铁门打开，带领暴徒闯入，将工友赶出宿舍，指名行暴殴打，有些工友前后被打十多次，重伤倒地，奄奄一息。有三个女工被推出马路，有些被脱去衣服，肆加侮辱。这些暴徒还捣毁工厂，并威胁厂方要答应把好的工友开除，以后录用员工要由“自由工会”选择等荒谬条件。
    下午六时左右，由一批“自由劳工”带领着暴徒，向宝星纱厂附近树胶服务部进袭，打伤了工友一人，并且追击其他工友，并将服务部内的财产抢掠一空。其后，这批暴徒进攻大行胶厂宿舍，把在休息中的工友，由暴徒的头子手持名单指名打伤了许多工友。
    同晚，暴徒数百人集结在东南纱厂门外，要厂方开门，否则就要打入工厂，我们在厂内的六十多个工友一面要求厂方不能开门，一面加紧自卫准备。暴徒在十时左右进了厂，但由于工友坚守工场，绝不屈服，暴徒虽然喊打喊杀，也无可如何，一直到次日上午八时后，这些工友才能集体而出。同日暴徒又围攻南海纱厂，在宿舍中的工友既没有准备，又众寡不敌，在加以抵抗后，一部分工友逃出，可是一部分女工逃不出来，情况如何，迄今仍未查明。
    在这次荃湾惨案中，先后被暴徒抢劫的尚有××金铺××理发室等，居民被迫挂国民党旗，被迫烧炮竹，几天来荃湾区的工厂全部停工，商店停业，学校停学，医疗所停止开诊，居民的生命财产受到直接的威胁，在几天中的损失，一时未能完全统计，但是荃湾区的居民从这次的荃湾暴乱中，认清了国民党特务分子的罪行。
    根据工友的报告，这些情形太可怕，也太可恨了。有关的详情还有很多，可是一时不能详说。就从上面所举的事实中，我们真正难以相信，不要说同是中国人，就算只是人类吧，也难相信这些手持国民党旗、身挂国民党徽章的特务分子和暴徒们，能够做出这种灭绝人性、罪恶滔天的暴行！我们四个受害的单位的工友们，和全港工人一样，对于这一次惨绝人寰的血海深仇，将永远永远不能忘记！
    （二）受害而至于死难、受伤、失踪的工友情况
    在这次荃湾的暴乱事件所造成的惨案中，我们的善良工友到处惨遭殴打、毒打、凌辱、掠劫，直至目前，还没能得到接近真实的完全数字。现在这里只列举出一些初步由受害工友及目击者反映的情形。
    一、已知道证实死亡的工友：纺织染：赵桢祥、余松金、杨注；丝织：梁鸿光、赖伯良；医疗所：杨观福。
      （知道已死而未见尸体，最近在医院内死亡而未得到正式通知，见过尸体而无从辨认的工友，都未列入名单。据一个可靠的消息，有好多个女尸，惨不忍睹。）
    二、受伤工友的数字：纺织染：九十二人；丝织：八人；树胶：十二人；搪瓷：四十六人；医疗所：五人。
      （以上工友数字，是已知受伤情况的，其中绝大部分是重伤，生命濒临险境。有很多工友受伤后入了医院而未知情况，或自行扶杖投医而未到工会报告的，都未列入在内。）
    三、失踪的工友数字：
    纺织染：七人；丝织：一人；搪瓷：一人。
    （因为很多工厂工友还未能上工，有些在事发时或事发后即不知所往，因此失踪数字目前仍是无从确实统计的。）
    （三）工会及工友财产所受的损失
    这方面现在还未能做完整的统计。
    工联荃湾医疗所全所被毁，所有用具、药品都已遭受破坏。损失估计约一万余元。
    纺织染服务部全所被毁。一切家具、杂物被捣毁一空，服务部中所存代工友购买的货品全部被劫掠，损失约五万元。
    树胶服务部全部用具被毁、货物被劫，损失约五千元。
    搪瓷分会全所被毁，损失约二万元。
    丝织工会全所被毁，损失约三万余元。
    此外，被杀、被打的工友，几乎全部衣服与身上手表、钢笔、财物都被掠一空，无从计算实际数字。
    工友因暴乱事件而遭受停工的工资损失现在仍无可统计。
    （四）我们的控诉
    我们抱着无限的愤恨、悲痛，报告了上述暴行的经过和我们工友所受到的浩劫。我们不能不控诉这一空前未有的、残酷的暴行！
    根据各方面的材料，我们正如全港同胞一样完全了解，这一次九龙暴乱事件和荃湾大惨案，完全是国民党特务分子一手制造的有组织、有计划的暴行！成千成百的工友看到那些人在指挥、那些人在带头、那些人丧心病狂的横行无忌，杀害和殴打我们的工友，那些在纵火、抢掳，我们认得出不少面目，喊得出不少名字，那些人以为我们的工友会被杀尽，可是，我们的工友是这样团结、坚强，工友们是顽强地生活下来，凶手们将永远不能逍遥法外！
    我们为死者请命，为伤者呼吁！希望新闻界的先生们主持正义，为因此死伤的工友伸冤！希望全体工友、友会工友一致起来，共同督促有关当局缉捕元凶，严惩祸首。我们希望香港当局立即公布这次荃湾区惨案的全部死亡工人居民的名单，公布伤者的名单，迅速合理善后。同时，希望全港工人，进一步团结互助、恤死扶伤，并共同为保障我们全港工人居民生命财产安全而努力！
