　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 8th: The wild oil plants in the mountains and forests of Jiangxi Province, such as camphor trees, crow trees, and Norway maple trees, have all produced seeds, and the supply and marketing cooperatives are preparing to purchase them.

　　In the first half of this year, the Jiangxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative had already purchased more than six million jin of various wild plant oilseeds such as camphor seeds and castor seeds throughout the province, extracting more than 900,000 jin of oil.

　　In the past two years, staff members of the Jiangxi Provincial Company of the China Oils and Fats Corporation have found sixty-two kinds of wild plant seeds in the mountainous areas of Jiangxi Province that can be used to extract oil. Among them, camphor seeds and crow tree seeds, which have a larger yield, generally contain about thirty jin of oil per hundred jin, and are good raw materials for making soap. Norway maple tree fruits, which are abundant in Xingguo County, southern Jiangxi, contain about thirty-seven jin of oil per hundred jin, and some local farmers also use it as cooking oil.

    江西省供销社收购野生油料
    新华社南昌8日电　江西省山林里的野生油料植物樟树、乌树、挪籽树等都已结籽，供销合作社正准备收购。
    在今年上半年，江西省供销合作社就已经在省内各地收购了六百多万斤樟树籽、蓖麻籽等多种野生植物油料，榨出了九十多万斤油。
    中国油脂公司江西省公司的工作人员，最近两年内在江西省的山林地区找到了六十二种可以榨油的野生植物的籽。其中产量较大的樟树籽和乌树籽每百斤含油一般都在三十斤左右，是制造肥皂的好原料。赣南兴国县盛产的挪籽树果籽，每百斤含油约三十七斤，当地有些农民也把它做为食用油。
