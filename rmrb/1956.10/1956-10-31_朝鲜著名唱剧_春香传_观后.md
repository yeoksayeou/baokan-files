A summary of the play "Chunhyangjeon", adapted from a widely circulated Korean folktale, has already been introduced to China. Chinese Yue opera, Ping opera, Peking opera, and other opera genres have all staged this play, and it has been welcomed by audiences. Now, the Korean National Folk Arts Troupe has come to China to perform the opera "Chunhyangjeon," allowing us to see Chunhyang as she was originally conceived, which is the common wish of the broad masses of Chinese audiences.

The singing and dancing in "Chunhyangjeon" fully demonstrate the national characteristics of Korean opera. Its elegant and simple style makes people feel intimate and beautiful. One of the characteristics of this play is its beautiful dance, which truly reflects life. For example, the love life of Chunhyang and Li Menglong in the "Love Song and Farewell Song" scene in the second act, second scene: Chunhyang walks down the steps and sees the flowers. She reaches out to pick a flower; she doesn't simply reach out her hand, but draws an arc from left to right with her right hand, extending her arms as if to embrace the flower. This movement is like the cloud hand in Peking opera, but not the same as the cloud hand; it is such a beautiful dance. Another example is in the first scene of the fifth act, when Chunhyang's mother, Yue Mei, sees Li Menglong return and enthusiastically leads him into the room with a series of dance movements, which are also very distinctive. Yue Mei, stepping in a dance, circled halfway around Li Menglong and walked in front of him. She picked up the ribbon on his chest, draped it over her right shoulder, and the two stepped into the room with the same dance steps. How cleverly this expresses their joyous emotions.

From the performance of this play, we can see the organic combination of the director's handling and the actors' performances into moving scenes. For example, in the "Hundred-Year Covenant" scene in the first scene of the second act, Li Menglong takes paper and pen to write, while Chunhyang thinks deeply against the pillar. The maid Xiang Dan brings wine. When the mother reads the marriage contract, Chunhyang gradually sits down, feeling that her life has been decided, so she pours wine for Li Menglong and offers it to him. The servant Fangzi (Li Menglong's servant) standing outside the house suddenly strokes his knee and laughs. In just these two minutes, the complex emotions of Chunhyang, Li Menglong, mother, Xiang Dan, and Fangzi, who are happy about this happy marriage, are conveyed delicately and compactly. In the performance of this play, several different meeting scenes each have their own merits. For example, in the fourth act, Li Menglong meets Fangzi by the roadside. At this time, he does not yet know that Chunhyang is suffering, and he is disguised as a beggar, so he jokingly talks to Fangzi, half covering his face with a fan. When Fangzi recognizes him, this humorous and interesting Fangzi is not as active as usual, but silently stares at Li Menglong and bows down. When Li Menglong receives the news of Chunhyang's suffering and goes to see her mother, Yue Mei, she is praying to the gods, completely unexpected. The two walk closer from afar, and the mother excitedly cries out and rushes towards Li Menglong. Immediately following this scene, Xiang Dan returns from outside and sees Li Menglong, which she also completely did not expect. She is shocked and filled with mixed feelings of grief and joy, prostrating on the ground and crying loudly. At this time, Xiang Dan expresses the same emotion as seeing her suffering master; because in her opinion, Chunhyang and Li Menglong are inseparable. The meeting of these two people, one in the room and one outside, is also quite different in its handling of status. After this, there are two meetings between Chunhyang and Li Menglong. In prison, Chunhyang struggles to raise her hand, which has been pressed by the cangue for a long time, and meets Li Menglong, who rushes into the prison gate and reaches out from the small hole in the prison door. This handshake is simple, but it is meaningful. The second meeting between the couple is in the main hall, which Chunhyang also cannot imagine. Chunhyang's tired and dazed posture, and the surprise of meeting in this occasion, shows that she has suffered all kinds of torture and finally achieved happiness and victory because of her unwavering "single-minded" struggle. These scenes of several characters meeting, with singing, dancing, and drama; with different emotions and also the same emotions; running through from beginning to end, one connecting to the next, reaching the final climax.

The songs and music in "Chunhyangjeon" show the beautiful and bright national characteristics of Korean art. The singing of the actors is very distinctive. Their singing has a taste of recitation, as if they are speaking. The actor who plays Fangzi often starts singing while speaking; it is like singing, but also like speaking. For example, in the first scene of the second act, "Hundred-Year Covenant," when Chunhyang, Li Menglong, and the mother sit down and sing, the section that Fangzi sings when he walks forward is almost indistinguishable from recitation. At the same time, throughout the performance of this play, the performance of the national orchestra not only sets off the dramatic atmosphere of the whole play, but also intensifies the unique national artistic style of the Korean people.

The script and director's handling of "Chunhyangjeon" performed by the Korean National Folk Arts Troupe are quite refined. The first act does not have the scene of Li Menglong and his servant drinking, but instead highlights the deep affection between Li Menglong and Chunhyang. The "Hundred-Year Covenant" in the second scene of the second act does not make it as difficult for the two to meet as in our performances of "Chunhyangjeon." The mother quickly invites Li Menglong into the room to meet Chunhyang. In the fourth act, Li Menglong first meets Fangzi on the road, and then meets the masses, which highlights the main part even more. In some of our "Chunhyangjeon" performances, most of us omit the scene of Li Menglong meeting his mother. Now, according to the performance of the Korean National Folk Arts Troupe, the two encounters in this scene are dramatic, and they are handled and performed well.

Thank you to the Korean National Folk Arts Troupe for their visit and performance in our country. The performances of these excellent Korean artists will leave an unforgettable impression on the Chinese audience. (Attached picture)

    朝鲜著名唱剧“春香传”观后
    罗合如
    根据朝鲜广泛流传的民间故事改编的“春香传”剧本，早已被介绍到我国来了。我国的越剧、评剧、京剧等剧种都曾上演过这出戏，受到观众的欢迎。现在，朝鲜国立民族艺术剧团来到我国演出唱剧“春香传”，使我们能看到春香的本来面目，这正是我国广大观众的共同愿望。
    载歌载舞的“春香传”，充分地显示了朝鲜唱剧的民族特色。它的典雅、纯朴的风味，使人感到亲切、优美。这出戏的特点之一，就是它那真实地反映了生活的优美舞蹈。如第二幕第二场“爱歌和别歌”中表现的春香和李梦龙的爱情生活：春香走下台阶，看见了花丛，伸出手去摘花；她不是那么简单地伸出手去，而是以右手从左至右地划了一个弧形，伸出怀抱似的手，直奔花丛。这个动作有如京戏中的云手，又不等于云手；是多么美丽的舞姿呵。再如第五幕第一场，春香的妈妈月梅见到李梦龙回来了，很兴奋地带他进入室内的一串舞蹈动作也是很有特色的。月梅踏着舞步，围着李梦龙绕了一个半圆圈走到他面前时，拿起他胸前的带子背在右肩，两人踏着相同的舞步进入室内。这又是多么巧妙地表现了他们的欢乐情绪。
    从这出戏的演出中，我们能看到导演的处理和演员的表演有机地结合成一个个的动人场面。如第二幕第一场“百年佳约”中，李梦龙取过纸笔写字，春香在一旁对着柱子凝思，婢女香丹送上酒；等到妈妈朗读婚约证书时，春香渐渐地坐下，感到终身已定，于是为李梦龙斟酒敬上；立在室外的房子
  （李梦龙的仆人）骤然以手抚膝作笑。仅仅在这两分钟的时间，细致地、紧凑地传达了春香、李梦龙、妈妈、香丹和房子他们为这件美满的婚事而高兴的、各自不同的复杂心理。在这出戏的演出中，几次不同的会见场面更是各有妙处。如第四幕，李梦龙在路旁遇见房子；这时，他还不晓得春香受难，又是化装成乞丐，所以用扇子半遮面地和房子开玩笑。等到房子认清了他，这个幽默有趣的房子一点也不像平时那样活跃，而是默默地盯视着李梦龙，俯身下拜。李梦龙得到春香受难的消息去看妈妈月梅时，正当她在对神祈祷，完全出乎她的意料；两人由远而走近，妈妈更是兴奋地长叫一声奔向李梦龙。就在这一场中，紧接着是香丹从外面回来见到李梦龙，这也是她完全料想不到的。她猛吃一惊，悲喜交集，伏地大哭，香丹此时表现了如见到了受难的主人一样的感情；因为在她看来，春香和李梦龙是分不开的。这两人的相见，一在室中，一在室外，地位的处理亦颇别致。这之后，就是春香和李梦龙的两次见面了。在狱中，春香挣扎地举起被刑枷久压的手，和连忙赶进狱门抢步上前，从牢门的小洞口伸手进去的李梦龙相见，这个握手相见的动作虽然简单，却意味深长。他们夫妻的第二次会见是在大堂之上，这也是春香想像不到的。春香的倦眼迷离的姿态，和在这种场合相见的惊喜，表现了她受尽摧残折磨，终于因为她的坚贞不屈的“一心”的斗争而获得幸福和胜利。这几个人物的几场见面，有歌、有舞、有戏；有不同的感情，也有相同的感情；前后贯穿，一次连接一次，达到了最后的高潮。
      “春香传”中的歌唱和音乐，表现出朝鲜艺术优美、明快的民族色彩。演员们的歌唱是很有特色的，他们的歌唱带有朗诵的味道，犹如在说话一般。饰演房子的演员有许多地方说着说着就唱起来了；像是在歌唱，又像是在说话。如第二幕第一场“百年佳约”中，春香、李梦龙、妈妈三人坐定在唱时，房子走上前去唱的一段，几乎是念唱难分了。同时，在这出戏的整个演出中，民族乐队的演奏不但烘托了全剧的戏剧气氛，更是加浓了朝鲜人民特有的民族艺术风格。
    朝鲜国立民族艺术剧团演出的“春香传”的剧本和导演的处理是相当洗炼的。第一幕中没有李梦龙主仆喝酒的场面，而是开门见山地突出了李梦龙和春香的相见情深。第二幕第二场的“百年佳约”，也不像我们演出“春香传”时两个人那么难相见；妈妈很快就请李梦龙入室和春香相见了。第四幕中，李梦龙是先在路上碰见了房子，然后才与群众见面，这样就更突出了主要部分。在我们的一些“春香传”演出中，大多省去李梦龙见妈妈这一场戏；现在，照朝鲜国立民族艺术剧团的演出，这一场中的两个相逢都是有戏的，并且处理得好，表演得好。
    感谢朝鲜国立民族艺术剧团来我国的访问演出，这些优秀的朝鲜艺术家们的表演将留给中国观众难忘的印象。（附图片）
