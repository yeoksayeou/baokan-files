Why It Is Necessary to Establish a National Time Service Network

The Importance of Time

	To know what time it is, we look at a clock. But how do we know if the clock is correct, not running fast or slow? Once, someone would set his watch to twelve o'clock every day when he heard the noon gun. Suddenly, he wondered how the person firing the noon gun knew when to fire it. He ran to the gunner and asked, "Sir, how do you know when to fire the gun?" The gunner replied, "It's simple. I have a watch that I calibrate at the watch shop. When the hour and minute hands align at twelve o'clock, I fire the gun." The man immediately ran to the watch shop and asked, "Excuse me, how do you calibrate your clock?" The owner replied, "Every day, when I hear the noon gun, I set my clock to twelve o'clock, and that's how I make my clock accurate." The gunner relies on the watch shop's clock, and the watch shop owner listens for the noon gun. Who determines the accurate time? It's neither the gunner nor the watch shop owner, but the astronomer using a telescope. Astronomers measure the positions of stars in the sky to give us the accurate time.

	In today's era of rapid train, airplane, and radio communication, the importance of mastering accurate time is self-evident. For example, if there are discrepancies in the arrival times of trains, tragic collisions can occur.

	Besides the need for accurate time in transportation, determining the location of a place on Earth (such as discovering a mine in the wilderness – longitude and latitude), surveying maps, and determining navigation directions for maritime and aviation all require accurate time.

	Time is one of the three basic units (length, weight, time) in science. All scientific research depends on time. Some scientific observations require such high precision in time that it is unimaginable for ordinary people. For example, in geodesy, the required accuracy for timing during the determination of so-called first-order astronomical points cannot be less than one-hundredth of a second. The time interval required for gravity measurements must not vary by more than twelve ten-thousandths of a second each day.

Measuring, Preserving, and Broadcasting Accurate Time

	The Earth's rotation is the standard for measuring time. The Earth rotates around its axis from west to east at a certain, fairly accurate period. This movement manifests in the sky as the daily cycle of the sun, moon, and stars rising in the east and setting in the west. Astronomers treat the sky as the face of a giant clock, with an imaginary hand that completes one revolution each day. This hand is called the meridian circle, the great circle that passes through the north and south points of the celestial sphere and directly overhead. Astronomers use precise instruments to record the moment a star crosses the meridian circle, verifying the accuracy of the astronomical clock in the observatory. The pendulum clocks commonly used as astronomical clocks are easily affected by temperature and pressure changes, so astronomical clocks are placed in constant-temperature rooms inside constant-pressure chambers. However, the weather in one location is not always clear, so astronomers cannot observe celestial objects every night for research. Observatories are equipped with various radio receivers to record time signals of various wavelengths sent by other time service stations. This method uses astronomical observations from other places to check their own astronomical clock. To keep one's astronomical clock at the correct time, one must constantly receive time signals from other time service stations to compare with one's own astronomical clock. A time service station broadcasts accurately calibrated time at fixed times, several times a day or continuously, through powerful radio stations for operational departments, which is called time service.

Modern Time Service Station Equipment and Work

	The work of a time service station can be divided into four parts: one is to measure time through astronomical observations, two is to keep time with astronomical clocks, three is to receive time signals with radio receivers, and four is to broadcast time through radio transmitters, with the help of radio stations.

	Since the procedure is so complicated and the required accuracy is so high, not only do the instruments used need to be highly precise, but the observers must also undergo long-term rigorous training. In modern time service stations, instruments for measuring time generally use meridian transit instruments, that is, meridian transit instruments with contact micrometers. Using two or three such meridian transit instruments for simultaneous observation can reduce not only accidental errors during observation but also systematic errors of humans and instruments. The manufacture of meridian transit instruments is becoming increasingly precise, with both machine-driven "super-personal error" devices and photoelectric methods for automatically recording star images. In addition to meridian transit instruments, time measuring instruments also include "super-personal error" prism altazimuths and photographic zenith tubes. The time obtained from astronomical observations and received time signals must be recorded with precise recording equipment. Commonly used recording instruments include chronographs, timing microscopes, and oscilloscopes.

	In addition to the astronomical pendulum clocks mentioned above, time service stations' timekeeping equipment includes quartz clocks with extremely stable rates. Quartz clocks are made using the piezoelectric properties of quartz crystals; oscillators made of quartz can generate constant high-frequency oscillations (50,000 to 100,000 cycles per second). This is currently the most accurate timekeeping equipment and a necessary component of first-class time service stations.

	Using the most accurate quartz clocks and modern time measuring and recording equipment, time service stations can solve many scientific problems, such as studying the Earth's uneven rotation, testing hypotheses of continental drift and longitude variation, and measuring the speed of radio wave propagation. These are all theoretically and practically important scientific problems.

	Time service stations transmit time signals according to a certain procedure, several times a day at the same time. For example, the Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory broadcasts time five times a day: 11:00, 17:00, 19:00, 21:00, and 23:00 (the formal broadcast starts three minutes before).

	To facilitate the use of time signals by operational departments, time service stations transmit time signals according to pre-announced procedures. Time signals are divided into two parts. The first part is called normal time signals, which can be used to measure clock errors to a tenth of a second, which is sufficient for general use. The second part is called scientific time signals, which are used to measure longitude, azimuth, and latitude, as well as for gravity measurements and checking the rate of astronomical clocks, as these all require precise clock errors.

Why It Is Necessary to Establish a National Time Service Network

	The time signals transmitted by a time service station have a certain degree of error due to the error in the master timekeeping clock, the adjustment error of the working clock for broadcasting the time signals, and the delay in the circuit for transmitting the signals. Two or three months after the time signal is broadcast, when the correction amount for the master clock is certain enough, each time service station publishes a so-called "time signal correction" table based on its own astronomical time measurements to eliminate the above-mentioned errors, so that people using the time signals can obtain more reliable results.

	In fact, even after adding the correction numbers published by each time service station to their own time signals, there will still be some differences. This is because the time signal correction numbers of each time service station are based on their own astronomical observations, and such astronomical observations are inevitably affected by errors in the adopted longitude values of each time service station, personal errors, unknown instrument errors, and local meteorological factors. Personal errors and instrument errors can be remedied, but the other two types of influences cannot be solved independently by a single station. Therefore, to measure accurate time, it is necessary to jointly solve the problem by several stations in different locations. This is the reason why a large country like China needs a time service network.

	Currently, there are two global time service networks. One is the International Time Bureau, hosted by the International Astronomical Union and located in Paris, which is a system composed of twenty-six time service stations. The other is the time service network of the Soviet Union and the new democracies, with fourteen participating stations. The Xujiahui Observatory time service station in China participates in the organizations of these two international time service networks.

The Current Status and Development of China's Time Service Station

	China's only current time service station is located in the Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory, which was founded in 1884 by the French Catholic Jesuits. Its original purpose was to serve the ships of the imperialists, and the required accuracy was not high. Since the People's Government took over at the end of 1950, a series of improvements have been made, and the accuracy has been significantly improved, but it is still not sufficient to meet the needs of China's growing construction. Currently, modern equipment is being actively installed to improve the accuracy of time signals, in order to meet the increasing needs of geophysical operations, geological exploration, telecommunications, surveying and mapping, navigation, and aviation.

	Within twelve years, a modernized, brand-new time measurement network will appear in China to serve China's economic construction and scientific research.

    为什么必须建立国家的授时网
    李珩
    时间的重要性
    我们要想知道现在是什么时候，就看看钟表，但是怎么知道钟表是正确的，没有走快或者走慢呢？从前有一个人，每天听到午炮响的时候，就把他的钟表拨到十二点，忽然他怀疑放午炮的人怎样会知道什么时候应当放炮？他就跑去问放炮的人：“先生，你怎么知道什么时候你该放炮？”炮手回答说：“这很简单。我有一只表，先在钟表店里校准，一到十二点长短两针相重的时候，我就点炮。”那个人立刻又跑到钟表店里去问：“请问，你的钟表是怎样校准的？”老板回答说：“我每天一听午炮响，就把我的钟拨到十二点，这样我就把我的钟表弄准确了。”放炮的靠钟表店的钟，钟表店的老板听午炮响，究竟要靠谁才能定出准确的时刻呢？既不是放午炮的，也不是开钟表店的，而是看望远镜的天文工作者。天文工作者测量星星在天空的位置，给我们以准确的时刻。
    在今天火车、飞机、无线电交通迅速的时代，掌握正确时刻的重要性，用不着说大家都很了然的。例如来往火车的时刻若有差异，就会演出撞车的惨剧。
    除了交通需要正确时刻以外，还有决定某一个地方（如在荒郊发见一个矿）在地球上的位置（经纬度），测绘地图、航海、航空的人测定航行的方向，这一类事情没有一件不需要正确的时刻。
    时间是科学上三个基本单位（长度、重量、时间）中的一个。一切科学研究都不能脱离时间。而且有些科学观测需要时刻精确度之高，不是一般人所能想像得到的。例如大地测量，在测定所谓一等天文点的时候，所要求的时号的精确度就不能低于百分之一秒。至于重力测量所需要的时间间距，在每一天的变化里不能差到万分之十二秒。
    测定、保守和广播精确的时刻
    地球的自转是测定时间的标准。地球绕着它的轴线由西向东，按一定的、相当准确的周期旋转。这一运动表现在天空中的情况，就是日、月、星辰东出西没的每日一周的运行。天文工作者把天空当作是一架巨大时钟的表面，它上面有一根幻想的时针，每天绕过一周。这根针叫做子午圈，就是经过天界上南北两点，直过头顶上的一点的大圆。天文工作者用精密的仪器，记下恒星过子午圈的时刻，以校核天文台里的天文钟的精准程度。天文钟通常所用的钟摆容易受温度和气压变化的影响，所以天文钟都放在恒温室里的恒压洞内。但是一个地方的天气不常是晴朗的，因此天文工作者不是每天夜晚都可以观测星象来进行研究工作的；天文台就设备有各种无线电收报机，以收录别的授时台所发的各种波长的时号。采用这个办法是借别地的天文观测来核对自己的天文钟。要使自己的天文钟经常保持正确的时刻，就必须经常地接收别的授时台的时号，来同自己的天文钟比对。授时站按一定钟点把考验精准的时刻，每天几次或连续不断地借强电力的广播台，把时号广播出去，以供作业部门的使用，那就叫做授时。
    近代授时站的设备和工作
    一个授时站的工作可以分为四项：一是用天文观测来测时，二是用天文钟来守时，三是用无线电收报机来收时，四是用无线电发射机，借广播电台的帮助来授时。
    手续既是这样的繁，所需要的精确度又是这样的高，所以不但使用的仪器需要高度的精密，而且观测人员也须得受长期的严格的训练。近代授时台里，测时的仪器，一般使用中星仪，即带有接触测微器的中星仪。用这样的中星仪两、三架同时观测，不但可以减少观测时的偶然误差，而且可以减少人和仪器的系统误差。中星仪的制造日益精密，既有用机器推动的所谓超人差的设备，又有自动记录星影的光电方法。除中星仪以外，测时的仪器，还有所谓超人差棱镜等高仪和摄影天顶仪两种。由天文观测和收录时号所得的时刻，必须有精准的记录设备，才能记录下来。通常所用的记录仪器有记时仪、记时镜和示波器几种。
    授时站的守时设备，除上面所说的天文摆钟以外，还有行速非常稳定的石英钟。石英钟是应用石英晶体的压电特性制成的；用石英作成的振荡器能够发生恒定的高周率振荡（每秒五万到十万周）。这是现在最准确的守时设备，是一等的授时台必须有的配备。
    使用最精确的石英钟和现代化的测时和记时的设备，授时站可以解决许多科学问题，如研究地球自转的不均匀性，检验大陆漂移和经度变化的假说，以及测定电波传播的速度等。这些在理论和实用上都是重要的科学问题。
    授时台发播时号按一定的程序，在每天同一时刻分几次进行。例如上海徐家汇观象台每天授时五次：即十一时、十七时、十九时、二十一时、二十三时（前三分钟正式开始）。
    为了便于作业部门使用时号，授时台按事先公布的程序发播时号。时号分为两部分，第一部分叫做平时时号，利用这些时号能够测定十分之一秒的表差，这已经足供一般的使用了。第二部分叫做科学式的时号，应用于测定经度，以及测定方位角和纬度的时候，还用于重力测量和校核天文钟的快慢，因为这都需要精确的表差。
    为什么必须建立国家的授时网
    授时台所发的时号，由于守时主钟上的误差，发布时号的工作钟的调节误差，以及传递讯号在电路上的迟滞等等原因，是具有某种程度的误差的。在时号发播后两、三个月内主钟改正量已经到足够肯定的时候，各授时台都根据它们自己的天文测时的结果，刊布所谓“时号改正数”表，以消除上述几种误差，让使用时号的人可以由此得着比较可靠的结果。
    实际上各授时站的时号加上自己所刊布的改正数以后，仍会有一些差别。这是因为各授时站的时号改正数，都是根据各自的天文观测；而这样的天文观测总不可避免地会受各授时站经度采用值的误差、人差、仪器的未知误差以及地方性的气象因素等等的影响。人差和仪器差是有办法补救的，至于其他两种影响，就非一个台站所能独立解决的。所以要测定精确的时刻，就必须联合不同地点的几个台站来解决。这就是幅员广大，像我国这样的大国，需要授时网的理由。
    现在世界性的授时网有两个，一个是国际天文协会主办的设在巴黎的国际时辰局，是全球二十六个授时台所组成的体系。另一个是苏联和新民主主义国家的授时网，参加的单位有十四个台站。我国徐家汇观象台授时站参加了这两个国际性的授时网的组织。
    我国授时站的现况和发展
    我国现时唯一的授时站设在上海徐家汇观象台内，是法国天主教耶稣会在1884年创立的。原来设置的目的，是为帝国主义者的船舰服务的，要求的精确度不高。从1950年年底由人民政府接管以来，作了一系列的改进，精确度已有显著的提高，可是还不足以应我国日益发展的建设上的需要。现在正积极装置近代设备，争取提高时号的精确度，以供日益增多的地球物理作业、地质勘探、电信、测绘、航海、航空等的使用。
    十二年内将有一个近代化的、崭新的测时网在我国出现，为我国经济建设和科学研究服务。
