Deep Impression
By Karim, Reporter for the Indonesian "Newspaper"

I was very fortunate to visit China in May of this year, and then to have the opportunity to visit this great country again four months later. The first time I visited China as a member of the Indonesian journalist delegation, but this time I am participating in President Sukarno's friendly visit.

From my first visit, I got the impression that the development of the People's Republic of China does not depend on the praise or hatred of people from countries with different systems. Whether praised or hated, the People's Republic of China is always moving forward, because its 600 million people are convinced that the system they support is correct.

There is a Western saying: "The voice of the people is the voice of God."

For those who believe in religion, the voice of God is the voice of truth. Therefore, the voice of the 600 million Chinese people who chose the people's democratic system is the voice of truth, just like the understanding of the voice of God by those who believe in religion.

My second visit did not change my original impression, and after four months, I saw the progress of the People's Republic of China in construction and ideology.

I don't need to repeat the progress China has made in construction, but one thing is clear: due to the rapid progress of construction, the domestic strength is becoming more and more consolidated.

Four months ago, I still had the impression that the domestic strength of the People's Republic of China still needed to be consolidated. For example, every time we Indonesian journalists took a plane to a certain place, our cameras were always taken away, preventing us from taking pictures during the journey. This gave us the impression that at that time, they were still worried that foreign guests invited to visit would take some photos that might be detrimental to the People's Republic of China. However, at that time, I thought that as a country that had only recently ended its war of liberation and was still facing enemy provocations, it was entirely right to take a cautious attitude in all aspects. Therefore, I can understand why photography was restricted. The same is true in Indonesia. We also do not allow others to take pictures of military projects or airports at will.

However, what I thought was justified four months ago has changed greatly now. In my second visit, not only were we able to take pictures smoothly, but we were also able to take pictures of airports. On October 5th, President Sukarno and his entourage visited an air force base. The Indonesian journalists and photographers from the Indonesian National Film Production Studio accompanying him left their cameras in the car in advance, because they estimated that taking pictures in that place would not be allowed. However, this estimate was incorrect, because the person in charge of the base told them that they could take pictures freely.

What does all this mean?

This is a transformation in understanding the development of something. From this, we can draw the conclusion that the People's Republic of China used to worry about their strategically important locations being photographed, but now this worry no longer exists. At the same time, it also gives the impression that the People's Republic of China is now more confident in its internal strength.

In addition, I also have the impression that in the past, the Chinese were worried or unwilling for foreign newspapers to publish photos reflecting the backwardness of the People's Republic of China, such as the mud houses of farmers, the patched clothes of the people, and the bound feet of women. In the past, people who had visited China often talked about the problem of restricting the photography of backward phenomena.

Now I see different facts. At present, the Chinese people believe that the existence of individual backward phenomena is a fact that does not need to be concealed. Backwardness in certain aspects does not mean that the whole is backward. Even if it is backward in individual aspects, it is constantly progressing in thousands of aspects. Therefore, backwardness in individual aspects is natural and does not need to be concealed.

During his visit to the People's Republic of China, President Sukarno also saw the mud houses of farmers, which is an individual backward phenomenon. But does President Sukarno measure the People's Republic of China from these? Absolutely not! In addition to seeing the simple mud houses, President Sukarno also saw magnificent high-rise buildings. Obviously, these new buildings will inevitably replace the mud houses that people still live in. In addition, new factories are constantly being built.

From what I understand, President Sukarno has a deep impression of the People's Republic of China.

But is it only President Sukarno or the people accompanying him who have the same views who have a deep impression of the People's Republic of China?

No!

The brothers and sisters of the People's Republic of China also have a deep impression of the visit of President Sukarno's friendly delegation, which is really exciting. The enthusiasm for welcoming expressed in the slogans and articles published in the newspapers shows that you have a deep impression. Premier Zhou Enlai said when he met with the Indonesian journalists accompanying President Sukarno's friendly delegation in Beijing that President Sukarno's speech was the voice of the Asian and African people in combat, the voice of national independence, the struggle for liberation and peace.

Therefore, obviously, we both have a deep impression. At present, our task is to maintain and develop these positive factors in all aspects. (Special contribution to this newspaper, translated by Huang Aling)

### 深刻的印象

    深刻的印象
    印度尼西亚“新报”记者　卡里姆
    今年5月里，我曾经访问中国，过了四个月以后，我又有机会访问这个伟大的国家，实在是很幸运的。前一次我是以印度尼西亚记者代表团团员的身份访问中国，但这一次我是参加苏加诺总统的友好访问团。
    从我第一次的访问，我得到了这样的印象：中华人民共和国的发展不是取决于那些来自制度不同的国家的人们的赞扬或仇视。赞扬也罢，仇视也罢，中华人民共和国总是不断前进，因为它的六亿人民深信他们所拥护的制度是正确的。
    西方有一句话：“人民的呼声就是上帝的声音”。
    对信仰宗教的人来说，上帝的声音是真理的声音。因此，六亿中国人民选择人民民主制度的呼声是真理的声音，正如信仰宗教的人对上帝的声音的理解一样。
    我的第二次的访问，没有改变我原先得到的印象，而且，经过四个月以后，我看到了中华人民共和国在建设方面和思想方面的进展。
    我不需要重复中国在建设方面的进展，可是有一个问题是明确了：由于建设事业的突飞猛进，国内的力量是愈加巩固了。
    四个月以前，我还有这样的印象，中华人民共和国国内的力量还需要加以巩固。例如：我们印度尼西亚记者每次乘飞机到某个地方的时候，我们的照相机总要被收去，使我们不能在旅途中拍照。这件事给我们的印象是，当时对应邀来访问的外宾还担心他们会进行一些可能有损于中华人民共和国的拍照。不过，我当时认为，作为一个不久才结束解放战争并且还一直面临着敌人挑衅的国家，在各方面采取谨慎的态度是完全应该的。因此，我可以理解为什么要限制拍照。在印度尼西亚也是如此的。我们也不让别人任意拍照军事工程或者机场。
    然而，四个月前我认为理所当然的事情，现在已经大大改变了。在我第二次的访问中，不但我们能够顺利地进行拍照，而且还可以拍照飞机场。10月5日，苏加诺总统及其随行人员参观一个空军基地，随行的印度尼西亚新闻记者和印度尼西亚国家电影制片厂的摄影师事先把他们的摄影机留在汽车上，因为他们估计在那个地方拍照是不被允许的，然而这种估计是不对的，因为那个基地的负责人告诉他们可以自由地拍照。
    这一切说明什么呢？
    对理解某一个事物的发展，这是一个转变。从这件事我们可以得出这样的结论：中华人民共和国过去担心他们的具有战略意义的地点被人拍照，而现在这种担心是不存在了。同时，这也给人这样的印象，目前中华人民共和国更加相信自己内部的力量。
    另外，我还有这样的印象，过去中国人担心或者不愿意国外的报纸刊登反映中华人民共和国的落后现象的照片，例如，农民的土房子，人民的补缀的衣服和女人的小脚。过去，来过中国访问的人经常谈到关于限制拍照落后现象的问题。
    现在我看到了不同的事实。目前中国人民认为，个别落后现象的存在是不需要加以掩盖的事实。某些方面的落后，并不等于整个是落后的。即使在个别方面是落后的，但在千百个方面却是不断进步的。所以，个别方面的落后是自然的，不需要掩饰。
    苏加诺总统在访问中华人民共和国期间，也看到农民的土房子，这是个别的落后现象。但苏加诺总统是不是从这些来衡量中华人民共和国呢？绝不是的！苏加诺总统除了看到简陋的土房子，还看到雄伟的高楼。显然，这些新的楼房必将代替目前还有人住着的土房子。除此之外，还不断建立新的工厂。
    据我了解，苏加诺总统对中华人民共和国有了深刻的印象。
    可是，是不是仅仅苏加诺总统或者同他有同样观点的随行人员对中华人民共和国有深刻的印象？
    不是的！
    对苏加诺总统友好访问团的访问，中华人民共和国的兄弟姐妹们也得到了深刻的印象，这实在令人兴奋的。您们在标语上以及在报纸登载的文章上所表现的欢迎热情，正说明了您们是有了深刻的印象。周恩来总理在北京接见随苏加诺总统友好访问团的印度尼西亚记者时说，苏加诺总统的演说是战斗中的亚非人民的声音，民族独立、争取解放与和平的声音。
    因此，显然，我们双方有了深刻的印象。目前，我们的任务就是维护和发展在各方面的这些积极因素。　（本报特约稿　黄阿玲译）
