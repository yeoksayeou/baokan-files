Xinhua News Agency, 12th, Randano Dispatch: The British Conservative Party Annual Conference opened in Randano, North Wales, on the morning of October 11th. More than 4,000 delegates designated by central and local party organization leaders attended the meeting.
    The meeting first launched a debate on foreign policy issues. This debate actually turned into a discussion of the "emergency resolution" on the Suez issue proposed by the party leadership. The resolution stated that the conference firmly supports the government's resolute policy on the Suez crisis and regrets the Labor Party's attitude on this issue. The resolution advocates international control of the canal.
    Many speakers at the meeting expressed their support for the draft resolution and vilified the Egyptian government.
    However, another member of parliament, Yates, pointed out that the threat of force cannot produce the results that Britain hopes for. He emphasized that Egypt's ownership of the Suez Canal is undeniable, and this ownership is clearly stated in Article 8 of the 1954 Anglo-Egyptian Agreement. He also said that the reservists mobilized to participate in the threat of force "know that they are participating in a farce," and "feelings of frustration and dissatisfaction" have arisen among them. Yates also criticized the government's Cyprus policy. Another speaker, Peter Walker, openly expressed dissatisfaction with the United States, demanding that the United States "stop that improper attack on British imperialism."
    Minister of State Nading, speaking on behalf of the government, repeated the hackneyed claim that Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal was an arbitrary act that violated the principles of international law. He threatened that if the United Nations, for some reason, proves unable to "fulfill its responsibilities" (that is, refuses to support the Western countries' demands in the Suez dispute), Britain will take action outside the United Nations. He said that the military measures taken by Britain and France show that Britain and France are "serious about" the Suez issue and "intend to take a resolute attitude."
    The draft resolution was then put to a vote and passed by the conference.
    The annual conference then discussed and passed a resolution in favor of the government's policy on colonial issues. Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd tried his best to defend the British authorities' policy of repression in Cyprus. He said that it would be impossible to give Cyprus a new constitution before it had restored "law and order."

    英国保守党年会开幕会议通过决议
    支持政府对苏伊士运河问题的反动政策
    纳丁代表政府威胁将在联合国外采取行动
    据新华社12日讯　威尔士兰达诺消息：英国保守党年会10月11日上午在北威尔士的兰达诺开幕。参加会议的有中央和地方党组织领导方面指定的四千多名代表。
    会议首先就外交政策问题展开辩论。这个辩论实际上变成对党的领导方面所提出的关于苏伊士问题的“紧急决议”的讨论。这项决议说，会议坚决支持政府关于苏伊士危机的坚决政策，并且对工党在这个问题上的态度感到遗憾。这项决议主张对运河进行国际管制。
    在会上发言的许多人表示支持这个决议草案，并且辱骂埃及政府。
    但是，另一位议员耶茨指出，武力威胁不能产生英国所希望的结果。他强调，埃及对苏伊士运河的所有权是无可否认的，这种所有权是在1954年的英埃协定的第八条中清楚地表明的。他还说，被动员参与武力威胁的后备役士兵们“知道他们正在参与一场滑稽剧”，他们中间产生了“沮丧和不满的情绪”。耶茨还批评了政府的塞浦路斯政策。另一个发言的人彼得·沃克公开对美国表示不满，他要求美国“停止对英帝国主义的那种不正当的攻击”。
    国务大臣纳丁代表政府发言时重复了这种陈腐的说法：埃及把苏伊士运河收归国有是违犯国际法原则的专横行动。他威胁说，如果联合国为了某种原因而证明不能“履行它的责任”的话（也就是拒绝支持西方国家在苏伊士争端中的要求），英国将在联合国外采取行动。他说：英法两国所采取的军事措施表明，英法两国在苏伊士问题上是“当真的，它们打算采取坚决态度”。
    决议草案然后付诸表决，并且为会议所通过。
    年会接着讨论和通过了一项赞成政府关于殖民问题政策的决议。殖民大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德，竭力替塞浦路斯英国当局的镇压政策辩护。他说，当塞浦路斯还没有恢复“法制和秩序”以前，给它以新宪法是不可能的。
