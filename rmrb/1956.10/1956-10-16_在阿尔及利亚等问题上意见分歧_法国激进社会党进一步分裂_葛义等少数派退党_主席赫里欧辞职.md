Xinhua News Agency, Lyon: The French Radical Socialist Party congress, which began in Lyon on October 11, closed on the 14th. The party, due to disagreements on issues such as Algeria, has fallen into a split. The minority faction, led by former Prime Minister Henri Queuille and former Minister of Industry and Commerce André Morice, withdrew from the Radical Socialist Party and plans to form a separate political party. Along with Queuille and Morice, some members of the party in the National Assembly and the Senate have also withdrawn.

Following the split in the Radical Socialist Party, its chairman, Herriot, announced his resignation. Herriot said he was "unwilling to be the chairman of a divided Radical Socialist Party." Mendès France was elected as the party's first vice-chairman.

During the conference, delegates heard reports from the party's parliamentary group. During the discussion, many speakers criticized the policies of the party leadership. Some delegates expressed concern that the party leadership had not fulfilled the promises made during the January 2, 1956 parliamentary elections, and that this would cause many voters to leave the party.

On the 11th, the congress passed a decision to expel Émile Foulquier, a prominent activist of the party, by a vote of 924 to 333.

The policy statement finally adopted by the congress stated in the foreign policy section that "France's primary responsibility is to uphold the obligations it has undertaken under existing treaties." The resolution called for strengthening "Atlantic solidarity" and strengthening "Anglo-French concerted action," and stated that "every effort must be made to bring Britain into European organizations." This section of the resolution also stated that efforts must be made to strive for "easing tensions in East-West relations."

    在阿尔及利亚等问题上意见分歧
    法国激进社会党进一步分裂
    葛义等少数派退党　主席赫里欧辞职
    据新华社讯　里昂消息：10月11日开始举行的法国激进社会党代表大会14日在里昂闭幕。这个党由于在阿尔及利亚等问题上意见分歧而陷于分裂，以前总理亨利·葛义和前工商部长安德烈·摩里斯为首的少数派退出激进社会党拟另组独立的政党。同葛义和摩里斯一起退党的还有这个党在国民议会和共和国参议院中的一些议员。
    激进社会党分裂以后，它的主席赫里欧宣布辞去主席的职务。赫里欧说，他“不愿意当一个分裂的激进社会党的主席”。孟戴斯—弗朗斯当选为党的第一副主席。
    在会议上，代表们曾听取了党的议会党团的报告。在讨论时，许多发言人都批评了党的领导的政策。某些代表表示耽心，党的领导机构没有实现在1956年1月2日议会选举时所许下的诺言，而这会使许多选民离开党。
    代表大会11日以九百二十四票对三百三十三票通过了开除党的著名的活动家埃·富尔的决定。
    大会最后通过的政策宣言在外交政策部分中说，“法国的首要责任是维护它根据现有条约承担的义务”。决议要求加强“大西洋的团结”和加强“英法的一致行动”，并且说要“尽一切努力把英国拉入欧洲组织”。这部分的决议还说，必须尽力争取“缓和东西方关系中的紧张局势”。
