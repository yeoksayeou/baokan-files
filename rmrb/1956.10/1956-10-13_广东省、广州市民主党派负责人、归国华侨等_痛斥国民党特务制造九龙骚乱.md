Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th. Leaders of democratic parties, returned overseas Chinese, and prominent figures in industry and commerce in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City have vehemently denounced the atrocities perpetrated by Kuomintang secret agents in instigating a large-scale riot in Kowloon. They expressed their views at a symposium held this afternoon by the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the CPPCC. Chen Jinleng, a member of the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, reported in detail to the symposium about the news he had received from relatives and friends in Hong Kong over the past two days regarding the looting and destruction of their shops and factories by Kuomintang secret agents. He said that even the well-known Garden Company, a biscuit company invested and operated by overseas Chinese, had been attacked, which was extremely infuriating.

Huang Jie, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia and the vice chairman of the Overseas Chinese Investment Company, said that the riot instigated by Kuomintang secret agents further clarified to the people of the world that they are a despicable and barbaric dregs of humanity.

All participants in the symposium also unanimously pointed out that the British authorities in Hong Kong have a full responsibility to promptly take decisive measures to suppress this riot organized by Kuomintang secret agents. Chen Zubei, the vice chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, who had been doing business in Hong Kong for more than 20 years and is now the general manager of the Hong Kong North-South Trading Co., said that the occurrence of this riot was entirely the result of the British authorities in Hong Kong consistently condoning Kuomintang secret agents. Now the British authorities in Hong Kong must come up with a solution to quickly and resolutely quell the riot directed by Kuomintang secret agents. Many speakers demanded that the British authorities in Hong Kong immediately arrest and severely punish the Kuomintang secret agents who caused the trouble. They also unanimously expressed their heartfelt sympathy to the compatriots suffering in Hong Kong and Kowloon.
