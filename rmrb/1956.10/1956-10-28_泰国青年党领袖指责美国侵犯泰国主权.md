    Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, 26th: According to a report in the "Freedom Communications Newspaper," the leader of the "Thai Youth Party," Nai Thongman Attahakon, told reporters on October 18 that the United States was infringing on Thai sovereignty.

    Nai Thongman said that the United States is the destroyer of Thai sovereignty. It has not treated Thailand equally and fairly. He cited as an example the obstruction by the United States of trade between Thailand and China. Thailand's foreign trade is bound by restrictive treaties, causing Thailand to suffer losses.

    Nai Thongman also said that since China has never been found to have done anything to harm Thailand, and if China's desire for peace is trustworthy, China's legitimate position in the United Nations should be recognized.

    Nai Thongman also advocated the abolition of the Thai government's "Anti-Communist Regulations." He said that this regulation threatens the freedom of the people and causes fear among them.

    泰国青年党领袖指责美国侵犯泰国主权
    新华社26日讯　曼谷消息：据“自由通讯报”报道，“泰国青年党”领袖乃通曼·阿塔哈空在10月18日向报界发表谈话，指责美国侵犯泰国主权。
    乃通曼说，美国是泰国主权的破坏者。它并没有平等和公正地对待泰国。他举例说，泰国同中国之间的贸易就受到了美国的阻挠。泰国的对外贸易受到充满约束性的条约的束缚，从而使泰国遭受损失。
    乃通曼又说，由于从来没有发现中国作出过损害泰国的事情，同时如果中国的和平愿望是可以信赖的话，中国在联合国的合法地位就应该得到承认。
    乃通曼还主张废除泰国政府的“防共条例”。他说，这个条例威胁到人民的自由，使人民产生恐惧。
