Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 12th: Hong Kong's English-language "South China Morning Post" today published an editorial, severely condemning the Kuomintang secret agents for instigating the Kowloon riots, and advocating the removal of these scoundrels.

The editorial said that Hong Kong residents expressed indignation at the lawless behavior of the rioters in Sham Shui Po, and the Hong Kong British authorities must take measures against this intolerable madness.

The editorial mentioned the flag-tearing incident in the Li Cheng Uk Resettlement Area and said: "Inevitably, some people suspect that the whole incident was a Communist conspiracy to frame the Kuomintang." However, the facts prove otherwise. It may seem unbelievable, but the fact is: "Since 1946, the Communists have hardly caused any trouble in Hong Kong, while the Kuomintang has been responsible for several incidents disrupting public order."

People still remember the Kowloon City conflict and the subsequent burning of the British Consulate in Guangzhou. The destruction of the Air India airliner Kashmir Princess has not been forgotten either. This consistent destructive behavior reflects the true face of the entire Kuomintang organization. It also proves that Hong Kong has no expectations of the Kuomintang, either now or in the future.

The editorial also pointed out that, without a doubt, law-abiding people will refuse to associate with them and join us in advocating: "Now is the time to decide to remove these bandits and those involved in the riots."

### 香港“南华早报”发表社论  谴责国民党特务　主张去掉这些败类

    谴责国民党特务　主张去掉这些败类
    新华社广州12日电　香港英文“南华早报”今天发表社论，严厉谴责国民党特务分子发动九龙骚乱，并主张去掉这些败类。
    社论说，香港有关居民对深水埗暴动者的无法无天的行为表示愤慨，香港英国当局对这种不能容忍的疯狂行动不能不采取措施。
    社论说到李郑屋村徙置区的撕旗事件后说：“不可避免有人这样怀疑：整个事件是共产党的阴谋，以嫁祸于国民党”。可是事实证明与此相反。说来似乎尽人不信，可是事实却是这样：“自从1946年以来，共产党几乎没有给本港带来麻烦，而国民党却是好几次破坏治安事件的负责者。”
    人们还记得九龙城冲突及最后引起的广州的英领事馆被焚事件。印度航机克什米尔公主号被破坏事件也没有被忘记。这种一贯的破坏行为，反映了整个国民党组织的真面貌。也证明不论现在或将来，香港对国民党都没有任何期望。
    社论还指出，毫无疑问，安分的人一定会拒绝和他们在一道，并且和我们一起主张：“现在已是决定把这些以及参与骚动的匪党去掉的时候。”
