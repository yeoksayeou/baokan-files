    Anhui Local Industry Gains New Strength
    Forty-Six Factories Moved from Shanghai and Qingdao
    (Our Newspaper) News: The construction of factory buildings for forty-six factories that moved to Anhui from Shanghai and Qingdao this year, producing power machinery, pesticides, bone meal, printing and dyeing, knitwear, flour, food, etc., has begun construction in four cities in Anhui Province. After these factories moved to Anhui, they were merged into eighteen factories based on the characteristics of their original production and the needs of production development. Except for the knitting and match factories, which are being expanded on the basis of the original factories in Hefei and Wuhu, Anhui, the factory buildings of the remaining sixteen factories are all newly built. Except for a few that have already been put into production, these factories are all under intense construction, and most of them will be put into full or partial production by the end of the year.
    After these factories start production in Anhui, Anhui's industry will be greatly developed, and the total value of Anhui's local industrial production next year will increase by 21% due to the addition of these factories. The variety of products that meet the needs of the people of Anhui will also increase significantly. For example, among the eighteen relocated factories, the products produced by seven factories, including pesticides, printing and dyeing, cosmetics, and paint, were completely unavailable in Anhui before.
    The relocation of these factories to Anhui will prevent the huge waste caused by the past transportation of products and raw materials in opposite directions, as they can obtain raw materials and sell their products locally. At the same time, after the state invests in adding some equipment to these factories, the output will be greatly increased, and the variety of products will also be greater than before.
    Among the forty-six factories relocated, forty-four were originally joint state-private factories in Shanghai. In the past, the labor production conditions were not good. After this relocation, the workers' labor conditions have been reasonably improved, and many physical labor processes have been changed to machine operation.

    安徽地方工业增加了新的力量
    从上海、青岛迁来四十六个工厂
    本报讯　今年从上海、青岛迁到安徽的动力机械、农药、骨粉、印染、针织、面粉、食品等四十六个工厂，厂房工程已在安徽省四个市全面动工建设。这批工厂迁到安徽后，根据原来生产的特点和生产发展需要，合并成了十八个工厂。其中除针织和火柴厂是在安徽合肥和芜湖的原有工厂基础上扩建外，其余十六个工厂的厂房全部是新建的。这些工厂在目前除个别已投入生产外，都在紧张施工，到年底大多数厂都要全部或部分投入生产。
    这批工厂在安徽开工生产后，安徽的工业就将获得很大发展，明年安徽地方工业生产总值将因为增加这些工厂上升21％。满足安徽人民需要的产品品种也将显著增加，如十八个内迁工厂中，农药、印染、化妆品、油漆等七个工厂生产的产品就是安徽原来完全没有的。
    这批工厂内迁安徽，由于可以就地取得原料，就地销售，即可防止过去产品和原料的相向运输而造成的巨大浪费。同时，在国家对这些工厂投资增添了一部分设备后，产量将大大提高，生产品种也比原来增多。
    在内迁的四十六个工厂中，有四十四个工厂原是上海的公私合营工厂，过去劳动生产条件都不好，这次内迁后都合理地对工人劳动条件作了改善，许多体力劳动过程也改成了机器操作。
