Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 1st: Hong Kong News: Compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong are celebrating the seventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with joy today.

	This morning, the five-star red flag was flying over the prosperous streets and some residential areas of Hong Kong and Kowloon. Many banks, shops, trade unions, societies, and schools have hung huge flower arches, colored paintings, and彩旗 at their gates. Some colored paintings depict China's domestically produced jet aircraft flying, some depict the newly produced "Liberation" brand cars, and others depict huge sluice gates and abundant agricultural products.

	The streets of Hong Kong and Kowloon are particularly lively today. Many workers, shop assistants, students, and residents are dressed in beautiful festive costumes to participate in various celebration activities. Ten theaters in Hong Kong, such as "Cathay" and "Victoria," are screening domestically produced films today, and the theaters are packed with audiences for each showing.

	Bookstores in Hong Kong are also very crowded today. Colorful posters of the motherland and portraits of leaders are being snapped up, and books introducing the motherland's socialist construction are also selling well. Nearly 10,000 copies of Liu Shaoqi's political report at the "Eighth National Congress" were sold immediately.

	The "Motherland Construction Photo Exhibition," sponsored by the Hong Kong All Circles Joint Celebration National Day Conference and exhibited in the auditorium of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, was flooded with visitors early in the morning. They appreciated more than 300 photos reflecting the happy lives of the people of the motherland and the construction of the motherland. Among them, the photos of Xie Yanan, a Kuomintang soldier who recently crossed the sea from Taiwan, and the uprising of Taiwanese air force personnel, were of particular interest to the audience. At night, the festive lights on many large buildings shone brightly. The main entrance of the Bank of China Building, the tallest building in Hong Kong, is decorated with a 30-foot diameter five-pointed red star. Under the red star is also a giant peace dove flying. The more than 7,000 electric lights installed in the building shone brightly, and the large characters "Long Live the Great Unity of the Chinese People" made of neon lights, six feet square, were very eye-catching. People could see the National Day lanterns decorated on this building from Kowloon.

	On National Day night, some groups also set off fireworks and salutes. Hong Kong compatriots are singing the praises of the motherland's prosperity and strength in an overflowing atmosphere of joy all day long.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 1st: Hong Kong News: More than 5,000 representatives from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon, including the industrial and commercial sectors, trade unions, commercial firms, societies, the press, the publishing industry, the banking sector, the education sector, the film industry, and the art community, gathered at the Kam Ling Restaurant in Hong Kong at noon today to warmly celebrate the National Day of the People's Republic of China in 1956. This is the first time since the founding of New China that all sectors of Hong Kong and Kowloon have jointly celebrated National Day.

	Gao Zhuoxiong, Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon All Circles Celebration of the 1956 National Day and Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said in his speech that the scale of the celebration of National Day by Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots is expanding year by year, and the patriotic enthusiasm is rising year by year. This is inseparable from the prosperity and happiness of the motherland, the improvement of the motherland's international status, and the care and attention of the motherland's government to Hong Kong compatriots. After describing the construction achievements of the motherland in various fields in the past seven years, he said:

	"At this National Day celebration, we must resolve that in the future, under the banner of patriotism, we will unite more closely and more broadly. We must not only further expand our unity with Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots, but also expand our unity with Taiwan compatriots and overseas Chinese, and strive together to build a prosperous, strong, and industrialized New China."

	Li Zisong, a representative of the press, said in his speech: "Our motherland is advancing victoriously. What we feel is a pity is that Taiwan compatriots are still under the rule of American military force and have no reason to participate in the construction of the motherland and share the glory and happiness of the motherland." He said: "On this great and glorious National Day, we cannot help but cheer and celebrate the construction achievements of the motherland, and we cannot help but express our deep hope for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the final completion of the great cause of the motherland."

	The conference also passed a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai amidst thunderous applause and cheers.

	Today, representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors, the press, the publishing industry, the film industry, the education sector, Chinese-funded banking circles, workers of all trades, residents of outlying islands and market towns, and farmers from 27 villages in the suburbs of Hong Kong and Kowloon also held gatherings and evening parties to celebrate the great National Day. Some group units have been holding celebration activities from September 27th and will continue until October 6th.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: All circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon held a celebration of the 1956 National Day on the 1st. The conference sent congratulatory telegrams to Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai.

	The telegram said that in the past seven years, the construction of the motherland has developed rapidly, the people's lives have gradually improved, and the international status has been unprecedentedly improved. Now the first five-year plan can be completed ahead of schedule, and the proposal for the second five-year plan has also been put forward. The future of the motherland is infinitely beautiful!

	The telegram said that on this great National Day, the whole country is celebrating. Our compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon are also very excited and joyous. However, looking eastward to Taiwan, eight million compatriots have not been able to share the joy with compatriots across the country, and have not been able to join compatriots across the country in building a better motherland, so we cannot help but feel regret. We sincerely hope that under the call of peace and unity of the motherland, in the near future, Taiwan compatriots will also be able to join the people of the whole country and jointly participate in the great construction of the motherland.

	The telegram finally expressed that it is necessary to rely more closely on the motherland, love the motherland, and further consolidate and expand the patriotic great unity, in order to cooperate with the great construction of the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 1st: Hong Kong News: Macau is filled with a festive atmosphere during the National Day. Fifteen major districts in Macau, including more than 50 streets, are covered with five-star national flags, and many commercial firms, societies, trade unions, and schools are also decorated with lanterns and彩带. The four huge arches built by the Macau All Circles Celebration National Day Conference stand tall in the bustling passages, attracting many visitors.

	The Macau All Circles Compatriots Celebration of the Seventh National Day Dinner Party was held today in the Five Continents, International, and Kam Shing restaurants. 1,200 representatives from all walks of life participated in the gathering. From September 25th to October 7th and 8th, there are more than ten days of celebration activities scheduled by social organizations: The Macau All Trades Workers Celebration National Day Conference organized by more than 70 industry worker organizations in Macau, the celebrations of Macau medical workers, the Chinese Education Association, the Macau Democratic Women's Federation, and the Macau Chinese Students' Federation, and cocktail parties have been held successively from September 25th to 28th, with the largest of them having more than 2,000 participants.

	All ten theaters in Macau are screening domestically produced films such as "Reconnaissance Across the River," "Guerrillas on the Plains," "Storms over the South China Sea," and "Exploration in the Deep Mountains" during the National Day to entertain compatriots from all walks of life in Macau.

    由香港各界联合庆祝国庆节大会主办、在中华总商会礼堂展出的
  “祖国建设图片展览会”，一早就涌进了许多观众，他们欣赏了三百多张反映祖国人民幸福的生活和祖国建设情况的图片。其中不久以前从台湾渡海归来的蒋军谢亚南的照片和台湾空军人员起义的图片，使观众特别感到兴趣。入夜，许多大建筑物上庆祝国庆节的灯饰放出万丈光芒。香港最高的建筑物中国银行大厦正门装饰着一个直径三十英尺的五角红星，红星下面还装饰着一只飞翔着的巨大的和平鸽，大厦装着的七千多盏电灯大放光明，用霓虹光管组成的有六英尺见方的

    港九各界庆祝1956年国庆节大会主席、香港中华总商会理事长高卓雄首先致词说，港九同胞庆祝国庆规模一年比一年更扩大，爱国热情一年比一年更高涨，这是同祖国的富强康乐，祖国国际地位的提高和祖国政府对香港同胞的关怀和照顾分不开的。他在叙述了祖国七年来在各方面的建设成就以后说：
  “在这个庆祝国庆节大会上，我们要立下决心，今后在爱国的旗帜下，团结得更紧、更广，我们不但要进一步扩大我们同港九同胞的团结，并且要扩大同台湾同胞和海外华侨的团结，共同为建设一个繁荣富强和工业化的新中国而奋斗。”
    新闻界代表李子诵在讲话中说：“我们祖国正在胜利前进，我们感到美中不足的，就是台湾同胞还在美国武力统治之下，无由参加祖国建设，同享祖国的光荣和幸福。”他说：“际此伟大光荣的国庆节日，我们都不免为祖国的建设成就而欢呼庆祝，也不免为和平解放台湾，最后完成祖国大业而致其深切愿望。”

    贺电说，在这个伟大的国庆节日，举国腾欢，我们港九各界同胞，亦莫不兴高采烈，喜气洋洋。但东望台湾，八百万同胞尚未能同全国同胞分享欢乐，未能和全国同胞一起来建设美好的祖国，就不免感到美中不足。我们衷诚希望：在祖国和平、团结的号召下，不久将来，台湾同胞也能同全国人民一起，共同参加祖国的伟大建设。
    贺电最后表示要更加靠紧祖国，热爱祖国，并进一步巩固和扩大爱国大团结，以配合祖国的伟大建设。
