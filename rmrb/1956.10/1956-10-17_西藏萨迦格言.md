Tibetan Sakya Proverbs

               ＊
    The ocean never dislikes having more water,
    The treasury never dislikes having more treasures,
    People never dislike having more happiness,
    Scholars never dislike having more knowledge.
               ＊
    As long as it benefits oneself,
    Even a child's words should be listened to;
    As long as it's for obtaining spices,
    Even a wild animal's navel [note] should be taken.
    [Note] Here, it refers to obtaining musk from the musk deer's navel.

    西藏萨迦格言
               ＊
    大海不会嫌水多，
    金库不会嫌宝物多，
    人们不会嫌幸福多，
    学者不会嫌知识多。
               ＊
    只要对自己有益，
    小孩子的话也应该听；
    只要为了取得香料，
    野兽的肚脐〔注〕也应该要。
    〔注〕这里指从獐子脐下取麝香而言。
          王尧选译
