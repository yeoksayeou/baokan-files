    When Will It Be Delayed To?
    We, all the employees, heartily welcome the State Council's decision on wage reform. Our enthusiasm for work has been further enhanced. However, the wage reform work in Liaoyang City is very slow. The State Council originally required the wage reform work to be completed between July and August this year, but by the end of September, the city's wage reform plan had not been approved. When we asked the comrades in the Wage Reform Office, they either replied, "There are problems that need to be studied," or said, "It's coming soon! Don't worry," and so on. I think if there are problems, where are the problems? Are the problems at the lower level? There are more than 20 full-time cadres in the Wage Reform Office, but we have never seen them come down to understand the situation. Are the problems at the higher level? They haven't given everyone a detailed explanation either. Therefore, everyone is guessing and waiting. Some employees are so impatient that they say strange things: "Great! Give it to us next year at this time, isn't that saving it up for you?" I think wage reform work is complex, but it can't be delayed from today to tomorrow, and from tomorrow to the day after. The employee comrades are dissatisfied with this slow pace. It is hoped that the Liaoyang Municipal Party Committee will inspect and urge the Wage Reform Office to approve the wage reform plan as soon as possible. (Shui Run)

    拖到何时
    国务院关于工资改革的决定，我们全体职工是非常欢迎的。我们的劳动热情更加提高了。但是辽阳市的工资改革工作进行得却十分拖拉。国务院原来要求工资改革工作在今年七、八月间结束，可是到九月底该市的工资改革方案还没有批复下来。当我们问到工资改革办公室的同志时，他们不是答复说“有问题须要研究，”就是说“快啦？别着急”云云。我想既然有问题，问题在那里呢？问题在下边吗？工资改革办公室有专职干部二十多人，总没有见他们下来了解情况。问题在上边吗？他们也没有向大家作一个详细的解释。因此，大家都在猜测，都在等待。有的职工实在等得不耐烦了就说怪话：“行啊！到明年这时候再给，不是给你储蓄起来了吗？”我想工资改革工作是复杂的，但是也不能今日拖明日，明日拖后日。对这种慢腾腾的作风，职工同志是不满意的。希望辽阳市委检查督促工资改革办公室，赶快把工资改革方案批复下来。　　（水闰）
