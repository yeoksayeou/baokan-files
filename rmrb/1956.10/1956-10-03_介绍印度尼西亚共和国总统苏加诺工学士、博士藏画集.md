President of the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, Sa Kongliao

When Dr. Sukarno, the respected President of our close neighbor, the Republic of Indonesia, arrives in Beijing as a state guest, we are extremely excited that his collection of paintings, compiled and printed by our People's Fine Arts Publishing House, will be published at this time.

The collection includes 206 works by more than 70 painters and is only a part of President Sukarno's collection. We believe that this collection can be regarded as an epic of the Indonesian revolution. The heroic struggle of the Indonesian people against colonial rule and for independence is strongly impressed upon us in this collection through the artists' paintings. They depict: the atrocities of the foreign occupation forces in Indonesia, the suffering of the indomitable people in displacement, the strong struggle of the people's army against the enemy, the heroic images of the leaders who led the people to resist the oppressors, and the people's love for their army and leaders. These works faithfully and successfully reflect the historical facts of the Indonesian revolution.

We can also regard this collection as a hymn to praise the nation and people of Indonesia. We all know that Indonesia is a beautiful country of thousands of islands, and its people are diligent, brave, intelligent, and peace-loving. This collection extensively depicts Indonesia's volcanoes, cliffs, plateaus, canyons, fields, streams, farmhouses, and temples; it also depicts the strong South Seas sunlight, the bright moon drifting in the clouds, the twilight with red clouds slanting across the sky, and the misty dawn scattering across the fields; it also depicts the sea surrounding Indonesia: the same sea, sometimes as still as a crystal mirror, sometimes rippling as gently as a down feather caressing the face, and sometimes roaring like mountains shaking; it also depicts Indonesia's flowers and trees: towering coconut groves, beautiful peacock trees, sacred water lilies, ... More importantly, it depicts the images, thoughts, and lives of the Indonesian people--their solemn, simple, or secluded and charming faces; their joyful, comfortable, or melancholic emotions; and their activities of cockfighting, dancing, production, and fighting. All these are intertwined. Who can say it is not a beautiful, visualized hymn that enhances people's love for the nation and people of Indonesia!

Naturally, we can also regard this collection as a brief history of the development of Indonesian art: because it includes everything from the Indonesian traditional paintings of centuries ago--Balinese paintings, to the oil paintings, watercolors, and pastel paintings of contemporary painters; from the myths and legends painted by anonymous ancient painters to the landscapes, portraits, and historical paintings of contemporary painters. A wide variety of themes are expressed through a wide variety of artistic techniques. The gorgeous and colorful Indonesian art overview composed of these works will undoubtedly encourage and guide people to delve into the treasure trove of Indonesian art.

In short, all comrades of our People's Fine Arts Publishing House who participated in the compilation and printing work have realized that when browsing this collection, their hearts seem to be unconsciously integrated with the hearts of the Indonesian people. The formation of this integration is of course due to objective reasons: both of our countries have beautiful mountains and rivers, the people are diligent, brave, intelligent, and peace-loving, and both have been bullied and trampled by colonialism in the past. Today, both have stood up through the heroic struggles of the people, but both have not yet completely completed the cause of independence and unification--they have West Irian, and we have Taiwan that has not yet been liberated. In the future, the people of the two countries must advance side by side for a long time to safeguard their respective national rights and ensure the great cause of world peace.

President Sukarno pointed out in the preface he wrote for this collection that he agreed to our publication of this collection (1) to make the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples closer, and (2) this collection can prove that independence has made Indonesian art rise and develop. The former point, from our personal experience, has shown that the release of this collection will certainly be able to achieve President Sukarno's expectations well. Regarding the latter point--that independence can make art rise and develop, we believe that all the works in the collection have indeed made full proof, thereby inspiring the patriotic enthusiasm of the people of all independent countries in the world and enlightening the revolutionary fighting spirit of the people who have not yet gained independence.

We deeply regret that due to our insufficient editing level and the limitations of the current level of industrial development on printing, we have not been able to compile and print this collection more perfectly, so as to better complete the mission entrusted to it by President Sukarno. But we sincerely recommend this collection to readers. It is the most magnificent flower in our art publishing garden this year!

    介绍印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺
    工学士、博士藏画集
    人民美术出版社社长　萨空了
    当我们亲密的邻邦印度尼西亚共和国的尊敬的总统苏加诺博士作为国宾来到北京的时候，我们人民美术出版社编印的他的藏画集，正好在这时出版，我们感到极大的兴奋。
    这部画集所包括的七十多位画家的二百○六幅作品，只是苏加诺总统藏画的一部分。我们认为这部画集可以当作印度尼西亚革命史诗来看。印度尼西亚人民为反对殖民主义统治、争取独立而进行的英勇斗争，通过艺术家们的画笔，在这个画集里给了我们极强烈的印象。他们描画了：在印度尼西亚的外国占领军的暴行，不屈的人民在颠沛流离的情况下受难，人民的军队对敌人所作的坚强斗争，领导人民反抗压迫者的领袖们的英雄形象以及人民对自己军队和领袖的热爱。这些作品忠实地成功地反映了印度尼西亚的革命史实。
    我们又可以把这部画集当作赞美印度尼西亚国家和人民的颂歌来看。我们都知道，印度尼西亚是一个美丽的千岛之国，人民勤劳、勇敢、智慧、酷爱和平。这部画集广泛地描画了印度尼西亚的火山、断崖、高原、峡谷、田野、小溪、农舍、寺庙；同时也描画了强烈的南洋的阳光，云层中漂流的明月，天际斜抹着红霞的黄昏，原野上飞散着薄雾的晓色；还描画了拱卫着印度尼西亚的大海：同一的海，有的静止如晶莹的明镜，有的泛着像鹅绒拂面那样温柔的涟漪，有的却作着撼震山岳的咆哮；还描画了印度尼西亚的花木：高耸的椰林，艳丽的孔雀树，圣洁的睡莲，……。更重要的是描画了印度尼西亚人民的形象、思想、生活。——他们的庄严、朴质或幽娴、妩媚的容貌；欢乐、安适或忧郁的感情以及斗鸡、舞蹈、生产、战斗的活动。这一切交织在一起。谁能说它不是一首美丽的、形象化的、足以增进人们对印度尼西亚国家和人民热爱的颂歌！
    我们自然更可以把这部画集当作一部印度尼西亚艺术发展史略来看：因为这里面包括了：从几世纪前的印度尼西亚传统画——峇厘画，直到当代画家们的油画、水彩画、色粉画；从古代佚名画家的神话、传说画到当代画家的风景画、肖像画和历史画。多种多样的主题，通过多种多样的艺术技巧表现出来。由这些作品组成的艳丽绚烂、花团锦簇般的印度尼西亚艺术概貌，无疑的它将是鼓舞、又是指引人们深入印度尼西亚艺术宝山的路标。
    简括来说，我们人民美术出版社参加编印工作的全体同志们都体会到，披览这部画集时，自己的心灵似乎不自觉地已和印度尼西亚人民的心灵融合在一起。形成这种融合，当然是有客观原因的：我们两国都有秀丽的山河，人民都勤劳、勇敢、智慧、酷爱和平，过去都受过殖民主义的欺凌践踏，今天都通过人民的英勇斗争站了起来，但是又都还未能彻底完成独立，统一事业——他们有西伊里安，我们有台湾还没有解放，今后两国人民为维护各自的民族权利和保障世界和平的伟大事业，更要长期地并肩前进。
    苏加诺总统为这部画集所写的序言中曾经指出来，他同意我们出版这部画集是：（一）为了使中国人民和印度尼西亚人民之间兄弟般的友谊更加密切，（二）这部画集可以证实独立曾使得印度尼西亚的艺术兴起和发展。前一点从我们的亲身感受已经说明了这部画集发行之后，一定能够很好地达成苏加诺总统的期望。关于后一点——独立可以使艺术兴起、发展，我们认为画集中所有作品，确实作了充分的证明，并从而激励世界上各独立国家人民的爱国热情，启发未获得独立的人民的革命斗志。
    我们深引为憾的是，由于我们的编辑水平不够高，印刷水平又受到当前工业发展水平的限制，未能使这部画集编印得更臻完善，从而更好地完成苏加诺总统赋予它的使命。但是我们衷心地向读者推荐这部画集，它是今年我们美术出版园地里一枝最瑰丽的花朵！
