    The Dong People's "Tea Offering"
    Yan Maoren
    The Dong people, who live in concentrated communities in Hunan, Guangxi, and other areas, have many unique ethnic customs passed down since ancient times, and "tea offering" is one of them.
    The Dong people have always lived in mountainous areas, and the tea they produce is tea cake made using local methods. In terms of color, aroma, and taste, it cannot be compared with the famous teas from all over the motherland, but if we talk about the diversity of tea drinking methods, then we should first talk about the Dong people's "tea offering."
    Whenever there is something important, such as guests arriving or a festival, every Dong family offers tea, and they also have tea with meals on weekdays. This method of making tea is not to brew it with boiling water. Instead, the tea leaves are first placed in a hot iron pot, with a little oil, salt, and rice, and stir-fried until they are burnt. Then, an appropriate amount of warm water is poured in. After the water boils, it becomes a common drink with meals. They say that using this kind of tea with meals is very helpful for digestion. The Dong people eat steamed glutinous rice year-round, so drinking tea has become an indispensable habit in their lives. After we tasted this tea, we called this drink Dong coffee, except that it has a slightly salty taste.
    Tea offerings are prepared with different contents according to the season and the guests. The most common is to put some fried rice pops in the tea, and sometimes sweet tea is prepared with some fried flour balls.
    When a more grand tea offering is encountered, various contents must be prepared. For example: red beans cooked very soft, fried soybeans, fried corn kernels, 油炸粑粑 (yóuzhá bābā - a type of fried glutinous rice cake) made from powder ground with a rice huller, oil-fried peanuts, boiled broad beans, dried shrimp, garlic leaves, white glutinous rice粑粑 (bābā - a type of cake or pancake), boiled sweet potatoes, fried cooked pig intestines, and a large amount of fried rice pops. When offering tea, put these things in a bowl first, then cover it with a layer of fried rice pops, and then pour the boiling tea juice from the pot into the bowl, so that guests can enjoy it. When eating, the host only gives you one chopstick, which means that the guest must eat at least two bowls, otherwise they will be unhappy. If it is a wedding day, anyone can go to the bride's house to have tea, as long as you can eat it, they will be most happy if you eat ten or eight bowls.
    There is also a sweet way to eat it. During the Lantern Festival on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, Dong families make many粑粑 (bābā - a type of cake or pancake) with white glutinous rice, cut the粑粑 (bābā) into pieces, and pour sweet tea on it, which is the best gift to treat guests.
    Regarding the origin of tea, there is also a myth circulating among the Dong people. It is said that a long time ago, people did not know that tea could be eaten. An old man went to the mountains to do field experiments to understand what plants on the mountain could be eaten and what could not be eaten. When he tasted the tea, he got drunk and fell asleep next to the tea tree, and slept until it rained. The rain dripped through the tea leaves into his mouth, and he woke up... From then on, people knew about drinking tea.

    侗族人民的“请茶”
    言茂仁
    聚居在湖南、广西一带的侗族人民，自古以来就流传着许多特有的民族风尚，“请茶”便是其中的一种。
    侗族人民向来住在山区，所生产的茶叶是用土法制成的茶饼，论起色、香、味来，根本不能与祖国各地的名茶相比，但是如果说起饮茶方式的多样，那么首先不应该不谈到侗族人民的“请茶”。
    每逢遇到什么大事情，比方来了客人或是到了节日，侗族人民家家都要请茶，平日吃饭的时候也都以茶佐餐。这种茶的做法，并不是用开水泡饮，而是先把茶叶放在烧热的铁锅里，加上少许的油盐和大米一起炒焦了，然后沏入适量的温水，等水煮开了，就成了平常佐餐的饮料了。他们说，用这种茶来佐餐对消化是很有帮助的。侗族人民常年都是吃蒸糯米饭，所以饮茶就成为生活中不可缺少的习惯了。当我们尝到这种茶以后，都把这种饮料称做侗族的咖啡，只不过略微有一点咸味而已。
    请茶，根据季节和客人的不同，准备不同的内容，最普通的是在茶里面放上一些炒米花，有的时候准备的是甜茶，在里面放上一些炒面球。
    遇到比较隆重的请茶，就要准备各种各样的内容。比如：煮得很软的红豆、炒黄豆、炒玉蜀黍米、用铲米磨成粉做的??、油炒花生米、煮蚕豆、虾米、蒜叶子、白糯米??、煮熟了的白薯、炒熟的猪肠子以及大量的炒米花。请茶的时候先把这些东西放在碗里，再敷上一层炒米花，然后把锅中正在开着的茶汁，沏入碗里，这样就请客人们享用了。在吃的时候主人只递一支筷子给你，这就表示客人至少要吃上两碗，否则他们会不高兴的。如果遇上了婚庆的日子，不论是谁都可以到新娘家去请茶吃，只要你能够吃得下，吃上十碗、八碗他们是最高兴不过的了。
    还有一种甜的吃法，在正月十五灯节的时候，侗族人民家家都用白糯米做了许多??，把??切碎沏上甜茶，就是最好的待客礼物了。
    关于茶的来源，在侗族人民中还流传着一个神话。据说很久以前人们还不知道茶是可以吃的，有一位老人为了了解山上的植物，什么是可以吃的，什么是不可以吃的，便到山上去做实地尝试。当他尝到茶的时候便吃醉了，倒在茶树旁睡着了，一直睡到天下雨，雨水透过茶的叶子而滴到了他的口里，他便苏醒了……从此人们才知道饮茶。
