Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 9th. The new construction project of the Lanzhou Qilihe Yellow River Bridge, connecting the emerging industrial areas on the north and south banks of the Yellow River in Lanzhou, officially broke ground on the 8th. After the bridge is completed next year, construction materials unloaded from the nearby railway station can be transported to the emerging industrial area on the north bank of the Yellow River through the new bridge, accelerating the industrial construction in this area. In the future, four cars can run side by side on the bridge, and there will be wide sidewalks on both sides.

This bridge adopts a cantilever beam structure, and the span of each beam is much larger than that of ordinary concrete beam bridges. Therefore, when constructing this bridge, it is possible to build fewer piers in the turbulent river.

    联接兰州黄河南北两岸
    七里河黄河大桥动工
    新华社兰州9日电　联结兰州黄河南北两岸新兴工业区的兰州七里河黄河大桥新建工程，在8日正式动工。这座大桥预定在明年落成以后，由附近火车站卸下的建筑物资，就可以通过新建大桥运往黄河北岸新兴工业区，加速这个地区的工业建设。将来，大桥上可以并行四辆汽车，两旁还有宽阔的人行道。
    这座大桥采用悬臂梁式结构，每孔梁的跨度要比一般混凝土梁桥大得多，因此，在建设这座桥梁的时候，可以在湍急的河水中少修好几个桥墩。
