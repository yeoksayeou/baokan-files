Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 14th: Hong Kong compatriots have been writing to the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" and "Wen Wei Po," demanding that the British authorities in Hong Kong severely punish the Kuomintang secret agents who caused the disturbances.

    A resident of Li Zhengwu Village named Ming Ou Rong wrote to "Ta Kung Pao," saying: "I am a kind and peace-loving resident. On the afternoon of October 10th, I heard that there were riots in the Kowloon area, so I crossed the sea from Hong Kong to go home. On the way, I was attacked by Kuomintang secret agents and injured in my hands and feet. Because of the curfew, I was forced to not be able to return home. A friend told me that my wife and sick daughter were shot and injured on the way to see a doctor, and their current situation is unknown. With tears in my eyes, I implore you to publish my letter immediately, hoping that the British authorities in Hong Kong will arrest Kuomintang secret agents and punish them according to the law."
    Another resident of North Point wrote to "Ta Kung Pao," saying: "What the Kuomintang secret agents destroyed was the blood and sweat of Chinese compatriots, and what they killed were also kind compatriots." He said that the riot caused hundreds of casualties and countless property losses. This lesson made Hong Kong residents deeply aware of the ferocity of Kuomintang secret agents and the terror-filled lives of the people in Taiwan. His letter concluded by demanding that the rioters must be severely punished according to the law, and the main culprits must not be allowed to go unpunished. If the British authorities in Hong Kong still allow the ringleaders to escape, similar incidents will follow one after another, Hong Kong will be under the terror of Kuomintang secret agents every day, and the safety of residents will be a serious problem.
    A letter from Chen Nan and other residents published in "Wen Wei Po" said that we are extremely angry at the lawless and inhuman behavior of the Kuomintang secret agents. Now that the atrocities have not stopped, we demand that the British authorities in Hong Kong immediately arrest the Kuomintang secret agents who launched the riots and the rioters under their command, and give the principal culprits the most severe punishment to appease public anger, quickly take effective measures to restore law and order, and immediately implement effective measures for the aftermath.

    香港居民深刻认识到国民党特务的凶狠
    要求英国当局对暴徒依法严办
    据新华社广州14日电　香港消息：香港同胞纷纷写信给香港“大公报”和“文汇报”，要求香港英国当局严厉惩办肇事的国民党特务分子。
    一个住在李郑屋村的明欧荣居民写信给“大公报”说：“我是一个善良和爱好和平的居民，10月10日那天下午，我听说九龙区有骚乱，就从香港渡海回家，途中遭遇国民党特务们袭击，手脚都受了伤。由于市面戒严，我被迫不得回家。朋友告诉我说，我的妻子和患病的女儿在看病途中中枪受伤，现在情况不明。我含着眼泪恳求立刻将我的信发表，希望香港英国当局逮捕国民党特务分子，依法惩办。
    另一个住在北角的居民写给大公报的信中说：“国民党特务分子所破坏的东西是中国同胞的血汗，所杀害的也是善良的同胞。”他说，这个骚乱事件死伤人命数百，财物损失无数，这个教训使香港居民深刻地认识到国民党特务分子的凶狠和台湾人民过着的恐怖生活。他的信里最后要求说，对暴徒必须依法严办，万万不能让主要凶手逍遥法外。倘使香港英国当局仍令元凶漏网，以后类似事件必接踵而至，香港将无日不在国民党特务恐怖之下，居民安全很成问题。
    “文汇报”刊载的陈南等一群居民的信里说，我们对国民党特务分子的这种无法无天、禽兽不如的行为感到万分愤怒。现在，暴行还未停止，我们要求香港英国当局，马上把发动骚乱的国民党特务分子以及其指挥下的暴徒加以逮捕，对首恶分子给以最严厉的处分，以息众愤，迅速采取有效措施恢复治安，立即实施有效的善后办法。
