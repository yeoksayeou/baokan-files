Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 12th - U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower denied on October 11th at his weekly press conference that there were differences between the United States, Britain and France in their policies on the Suez Canal issue.

Eisenhower's remarks were prompted by a reporter's question. The reporter pointed out that due to disagreements over the Suez Canal dispute, "dispatches from London and Paris in recent days have reflected a growing anti-American sentiment," and he requested comments on the situation.

Eisenhower further said that U.S. policy has always been based on "clear principles." These principles are concentrated in the eighteen-nation plan for "international control" of the Suez Canal. He said that the United States has always adhered to these principles, which are not negotiable, but no one has ever indicated that the details cannot be negotiated.

    艾森豪威尔谈苏伊士问题
    掩饰西方国家间的分歧
    据新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔10月11日在他的每周记者招待会上否认美国同英法之间在对苏伊士运河问题的政策上有分歧。
    艾森豪威尔的谈话是由一个记者的问题引起的。这个记者指出，由于在苏伊士运河问题争端上意见分歧，近几天来“伦敦和巴黎的电讯都反映出反美情绪的不断高涨”，他请求就这种情况发表意见。
    艾森豪威尔又说，美国政策一直是以“明确的原则”为基础的。这些原则就集中表现在“国际管制”苏伊士运河的十八国计划上。他说，美国始终遵守这些原则，这些原则是不能谈判的，但是从来没有人表示细节不可以协商。
