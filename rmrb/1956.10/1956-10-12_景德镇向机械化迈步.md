Jingdezhen Marches Towards Mechanization
By our reporter Li Lianbin

Jingdezhen—this ancient porcelain city has taken on a new look after the socialist transformation this spring. Standing on high ground on one side of the city, you can see, next to the numerous old and tall chimneys, new and even taller chimneys rising one after another. Beside the low and small old-fashioned workshops, new and tall modern factories are being built one after another. Alongside the teams of shoulder-carried and hand-pushed carts, trucks shuttle back and forth. Mixed in with the sound of hand-cranked windlasses is the sound of electric windlasses. The brand-new chimneys, new factories, and new production tools, although few in number today, all indicate that this ancient, handicraft-based porcelain city is beginning to move towards a porcelain city with mechanized production.

When I walked near the Fourth Porcelain Cooperative, I saw the newly built factory standing majestically among the clustered houses, appearing quite different. This cooperative has already achieved semi-mechanization. I saw the electric windlass-driven shaping machine, which could shape a piece of porcelain in a few seconds, three times faster than manual shaping, and with more uniform specifications and higher quality. Now, this cooperative has become an all-round factory, capable of making decorative items, tableware, coffee sets, high-grade art porcelain, and other daily-use porcelain. Its annual output in 1955 reached 18,600 dan (a unit of weight), and this year's actual output is expected to reach 34,000 dan. In 1950, it was just a cooperative organized by twenty unemployed workers, with incomplete tools, only able to make needle holders. To make other porcelain, they had to borrow someone else's kiln. Now, the entire cooperative has grown to 1,300 people.

The joint state-private factories have also enriched their production equipment. The Third Joint State-Private Factory has also built new factory buildings. The new factory building is semi-mechanized, while the old factory building relies on handicrafts. In the new factory building, each worker operating a windlass has an electric fan beside him. Working under an electric fan is a historic first for porcelain workers in Jingdezhen. The Fourth Joint State-Private Factory is being invested in by the state to build new factory buildings, which will be completed by the end of next year. At that time, it will become a brand-new, semi-mechanized, all-round factory with more than 1,000 people engaged in production. Some processes will even be automated. The porcelain will be shaped using advanced operating methods, half by slip casting and half by pressure molding, which can increase productivity by one to two times.

Ceramic art workers are developing the excellent traditions and unique national style of Chinese ceramic art, with new developments in color glaze, painting, sculpture, and modeling. In 1954, through the painstaking research of veteran artists and other ceramic art workers, more than a dozen world-renowned and unparalleled color glazes were restored. Among the restored color glazes, the underglaze red, kiln transmutation glaze, Jun red, Lang kiln red (sacrificial red), beauty's blush (peach bloom), and sky blue can be compared with the highest levels in history. By 1955, the yield rate of bean green, Lang kiln red, tea dust, and beauty's blush had increased from 40% in 1954 to 70%, and sacrificial red had increased from 50% to 90%. In 1955, blue kiln transmutation, blue flower glaze, and imitation Song Jun were created. In 1955, research work was carried out on low-temperature color glazes, and more than ten kinds of low-temperature color glazes, such as the historical famous "gold star green" and ivory yellow, were produced. These diverse color glaze porcelains are sometimes dignified and elegant, sometimes simple and generous, sometimes brilliant and dazzling, and sometimes refreshing and pleasant. When you see these porcelains in the exhibition hall, you will feel like you are in a large art gallery and marvel at them.

It is worth mentioning that the variety of porcelain has increased, and decorative porcelain, tea sets, tableware, coffee sets, industrial porcelain, and sanitary porcelain can all be manufactured. The annual output of porcelain has exceeded the historical peak of 800,000 dan, reaching 807,981 dan.

Jingdezhen porcelain, with its color glaze, blue and white, antique colors, famille rose, doucai, and bodiless porcelain, is extremely popular with people from all over the world. Jingdezhen porcelain is sold to the Soviet Union, various people's democratic countries, and Burma, Thailand, India, Indonesia, Ceylon, Nepal, Egypt, Malaya, and Singapore. Exports to the United Kingdom, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, and France are gradually increasing. If 1954 is taken as 100, then 1955 is 500, and 1956 is 1,000.

In 1954, according to the technical cooperation agreements between China and foreign countries, Jingdezhen unreservedly introduced the technology and experience of porcelain manufacturing to fraternal countries such as the German Democratic Republic, Albania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria. Jingdezhen has also successively sent ten engineers, technicians, and skilled workers to help Korea and Mongolia build the ceramic industry. Ceramic experts and artists from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries have come to Jingdezhen to visit and study, exchanging technical experiences. Jingdezhen's porcelain industry has also received technical guidance and assistance from various fraternal countries.

In order to meet the needs of foreign and domestic markets, the relevant leading organs in Jingdezhen have formulated a development plan for porcelain. According to the plan, the output in 1962 will reach 1.5 million dan, of which fine porcelain will account for 80%; in 1967, it will reach 3 million dan, all of which will be fine porcelain. With the expansion of production tasks, modern porcelain factories will be born accordingly. It has now been decided to build an all-round factory with a tunnel kiln. This factory is entirely funded by the state and will begin construction next year. By 1967, the new Jingdezhen industrial zone will be fully completed, and the existing old-fashioned porcelain factories will be completely replaced by modern porcelain factories. By that time, the face of Jingdezhen will be completely new.

    景德镇向机械化迈步
    本报记者　李连斌
    景德镇——这座古老的瓷城，经过了今年春季社会主义改造，出现了一片新兴的气象。你站在城的一边的高处望去，可以看见在林立的陈旧的高大烟囱的旁边，一个一个崭新的更高大的烟囱竖立起来了，在低小的旧式的厂房边，一个一个高大的新式的厂房建立起来了，在肩挑、手推车的队伍旁边，载重汽车往来如梭，在手摇辘轳车的声音里夹杂着电动辘轳车的响声。崭新的烟囱，新的厂房，新的生产工具，在今天说来虽是少数，但一切迹象表明，这座古老的、手工业的瓷城，正开始向机械生产的瓷城迈进。
    当我走进第四瓷器社附近的时候，看见新建的厂房，巍然地立在群集的房舍中，显得与众不同。这个社已实现了半机械化。我看到电动辘轳带动的压坯机，几秒钟就使一件瓷器成型，比手工成型快三倍，规格又统一，质量又高。现在这个社已经成为全能厂，像陈设品、餐具，咖啡具，高级美术瓷和其他日用瓷都能作，1955年的年产量已达一万八千六百担，今年的实产量可达三万四千担。在1950年，它只是一个由二十个失业工人组织起来的社，工具不齐全，只能作针匙，要做其他瓷器，就要借别人的窑烧。现在，全社已发展到一千三百人。
    公私合营厂，也充实了生产设备。公私合营第三厂还新建了厂房。新厂房是半机械化的，旧厂房是手工业的。在新厂房里，司掌辘轳车的每一个工人的身旁都有一个电扇，在电扇底下工作，这是景德镇瓷业工人的历史上的创举。公私合营第四厂正在由国家投资，兴建新厂房，明年年底就可以建成。到那时，它将成为一个全新的、半机械化的、一千多人进行生产的全能厂，部分工序还是自动化的，瓷器成型全部采用先进操作方法，一半采用注浆，一半采用压坯，这样可以提高生产率一倍到两倍。
    陶瓷美术工作者在发扬我国陶瓷美术的优良传统和特有的民族风格，色釉、彩绘、雕塑和造型等方面都有新的发展。1954年在老艺人和其他陶瓷美术工作者的苦心钻研下，恢复了闻名世界的、举世无双的颜色釉十几种。在恢复的十几种色釉中的釉里红、窑变花釉、均红、郎窑红（祭红）、美人醉（桃花片）、天青等可与历史上的最高水平相媲美。到1955年，豆青、郎窑红、茶叶末、美人醉的成品率，已由1954年的40％提高到70％，祭红从50％提高到90％。在1955年并创制了蓝窑变、蓝花釉，仿宋均等三种颜色釉。在1955年进行了低温色釉的研究工作，制成了历史上的名品“金星绿”和象牙黄等低温色釉十多种。这些多种多样的颜色釉瓷器，有的凝重幽雅，有的素洁大方，有的灿烂夺目，有的爽朗宜人。在陈列室里看到这些瓷器，你就会有置身于一个大画廊一般而赞叹不已。
    值得提出来的，就是瓷器的品种增多了，陈设瓷、茶具、餐具、咖啡具、工业用瓷、卫生用瓷都能制造了。瓷器的年产量已超过历史上八十万担的最高水平，达到八十万七千九百八十一担。
    景德镇瓷器的颜色釉、青花、古彩、粉彩、斗彩、萡胎等，极为世界各国人士所喜爱。景德镇的瓷器行销苏联、各人民民主国家，和缅甸、泰国、印度、印度尼西亚、锡兰、尼泊尔、埃及、马来亚、新加坡，对英国、比利时、瑞士、意大利、法国的出口量逐渐增加，如果以1954年为一百，1955年则为五百，1956年则为一千。
    1954年，根据我国和外国的技术合作协定，景德镇先后向德意志民主共和国、阿尔巴尼亚、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚等兄弟国家毫无保留地介绍了制瓷器的技术和经验。景德镇还先后派出十名工程师、技士、技工帮助朝鲜、蒙古建设陶瓷工业。苏联及其他兄弟国家的陶瓷专家和美术家等，都曾先后来景德镇参观和考察，交流技术经验。景德镇的瓷业也获得了各兄弟国家的技术指导和帮助。
    为了适应国外国内的需要，景德镇的有关领导机关已制定了瓷器的发展规划。按照规划，1962年的产量将达到一百五十万担，其中细瓷占80％；1967年将达到三百万担，全部是细瓷。随着生产任务的扩大，现代化的瓷厂将随之而诞生。现在已经决定建设一座隧道窑的全能厂。这个厂全部由国家投资，明年就可动工兴建。到1967年的时候，新的景德镇工业区就可全部建成了，现有的古式的瓷厂将全部为现代化的瓷厂所代替。到那个时候，景德镇的面貌就会焕然一新了。
