    The negotiations between the Soviet Union and Japan on the restoration of normal relations, after a long delay, have finally reached an agreement. On October 19, the plenipotentiary delegations of the two governments signed a joint declaration in the Grand Kremlin, deciding that on the date the joint declaration is ratified and takes effect, the state of war between the two countries is declared to be over, and peaceful and good-neighborly relations are re-established, with the exchange of diplomatic representatives at the ambassadorial level. The two countries also affirmed the principles of the United Nations Charter as the norms of relations between the two countries, and the Soviet Union supported Japan's request to join the United Nations. The joint declaration stipulated that after the restoration of diplomatic relations, the two sides will continue negotiations on the conclusion of a peace treaty. The Soviet Union agreed to hand over the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Island to Japan at the same time as the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese peace treaty. The issues between the Soviet Union and Japan regarding the repatriation of Japanese war criminals in the Soviet Union, the agreement on a trade agreement between the two countries, and the entry into force of the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Treaty have also been satisfactorily resolved.
    The restoration of normal relations between the Soviet Union and Japan has been a long-standing and urgent demand of the Japanese people. The Japanese people have made unyielding efforts to urge the Japanese government to conduct negotiations and end the state of war with the Soviet Union as soon as possible. Prime Minister Hatoyama and his government have also made many promises to the Japanese people, expressing their desire to restore normal relations with the Soviet Union as soon as possible. However, due to the obstruction of the United States, some people within the Japanese government and the ruling party were hesitant, and some even took an opposing attitude, which led to the interruption of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations on the restoration of normal relations three times since they began in London in June last year. In the final stage of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations in London, the two sides had actually reached ten agreements on the signing of a Soviet-Japanese peace treaty. Except for the territorial issue, almost all other issues had been settled. At that time, if the Japanese government was willing to make further efforts and did not recall its plenipotentiary representative, the London negotiations would have been entirely possible to succeed. In the third Soviet-Japanese negotiation, the Soviet Union and Japan, through friendly and frank consultations, even the Japanese plenipotentiary representative, Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, who was conducting the negotiations at that time, believed that the Soviet-Japanese peace treaty could be signed. However, at this time, the Japanese government suddenly changed its mind and recalled Shigemitsu, causing the Soviet-Japanese negotiations on the restoration of normal relations to be interrupted for the third time. This time, Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama, after considering the entire situation in Japan and abroad more soberly and overcoming obstacles from all sides, personally went to Moscow to negotiate and finally reached an agreement with the Soviet government delegation on the restoration of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Japan. The realistic attitude adopted by Prime Minister Hatoyama is in line with the interests and aspirations of the Japanese people, and will of course be supported and welcomed by the broad masses of the Japanese people.
    The Soviet government's consistent, reasonable and positive attitude played an extremely important role in the eventual success of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations. Throughout the entire process of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, the Soviet government took into account the situation and aspirations of the Japanese side, always adopted a patient and friendly attitude, and made many efforts. Now the facts once again show that the Soviet government sincerely pursues a peaceful foreign policy of friendly cooperation with all countries. It can also be seen from the joint declaration between the Soviet Union and Japan on the restoration of diplomatic relations that the various agreements reached by the two sides were resolved on an equal footing on many issues, but the resolution of many issues was achieved only after the Soviet government made great concessions to the Japanese side. For example, the territorial issue, the release of Japanese war criminals, the fisheries issue, and the issue of supporting Japan's accession to the United Nations are all like this. People from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also believed when commenting on the agreement reached in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations on the 19th that "the Soviet Union has considered Japan's position." The Soviet government and people's reasonable and friendly attitude towards Japan has been widely praised by public opinion in various countries.
    For the past eleven years since the war, the U.S. government has tried every means to prevent Japan from restoring normal relations with its two major neighbors, the Soviet Union and China. The purpose of the United States in doing this is to prevent Japan from embarking on the road of independence and autonomy, so that it can occupy Japan for a long time, turn Japan into its colony and base for aggressive war, and at the same time attempt to maintain the tense situation in the Far East. This is why the United States has been expressing its unease and trying to obstruct the restoration of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Japan throughout the Soviet-Japanese negotiations. Therefore, the decision of the Soviet Union and Japan to restore diplomatic relations not only opened up the road of friendly cooperation for the two countries, but also will be conducive to Japan's independent development and to strengthening peace in the Far East. The fact that the Soviet-Japanese negotiations finally achieved success also proves that the will of the Soviet and Japanese people to restore normal relations and carry out friendly cooperation cannot be stopped by any force.
    Now the U.S. government authorities' attempt to sabotage the Soviet-Japanese negotiations has failed; however, there are signs that its next step will inevitably be to step up efforts to obstruct the normalization of relations between China and Japan. The Japanese people's call for the restoration of normal relations with China has also been rising in recent years. Because the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations is in the greatest interest of the Japanese people. As the Japanese Socialist Party said in a statement issued on the 19th after discussing the Soviet-Japanese negotiations: Due to the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, Japan's foreign policy has entered a period of great transformation, and it should expedite the restoration of diplomatic relations with China as soon as possible. This is a powerful cry expressing the heartfelt wishes of the Japanese people, and the United States' attempt to step up its efforts to obstruct the development of friendly relations between China and Japan is also destined to fail in the end.
    The Chinese people sympathize deeply with the situation of the Japanese people after the war and sincerely hope that it can live in harmony with all countries, thereby promoting its independent development. While sincerely congratulating Japan and the Soviet Union on the restoration of diplomatic relations, the Chinese people sincerely hope that normal relations between China and Japan can also be restored at an early date. We believe that as long as both China and Japan hold a sincere and friendly attitude and take practical and active measures, the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries can also be achieved.

### 欢迎苏日恢复邦交

    欢迎苏日恢复邦交
    苏联和日本关于恢复两国正常关系的谈判，经过长期拖延，终于达成了协议。两国政府全权代表团10月19日在大克里姆林宫签订了一项联合宣言，决定两国在联合宣言批准生效之日起，两国之间的战争状态宣告结束，重新建立和平和睦邻的关系，互换大使级外交代表。两国并确认以联合国宪章的原则为两国关系的准则，苏联支持日本加入联合国的要求。联合宣言中约定，双方在恢复外交关系后，继续进行关于缔结和约的谈判。苏联同意在缔结苏日和约的同时，将齿舞群岛和色丹岛交给日本。苏日两国之间关于遣返在苏联的日本战犯、商定两国的贸易协定以及日苏渔业条约生效等问题，也都圆满地达成协议。
    恢复苏日正常关系，是日本人民长久以来的迫切要求。日本人民为了促使日本政府进行谈判，同苏联早日结束战争状态，曾经作了不屈不挠的努力。鸠山首相和他的政府也曾向日本人民作过多次诺言，表示要同苏联早日恢复正常关系。但是，由于美国的从中阻挠，日本政府和执政党内部也有一些人举棋不定，有些人甚至采取反对的态度，以致苏日关于恢复两国正常关系的谈判，从去年6月在伦敦开始以来，曾经三度被中断。苏日两国在伦敦谈判中的最后阶段，双方实际上已经就签订苏日和约达成了十项协议，除领土问题没有得到解决以外，其他问题差不多都谈妥了。当时日本政府如果愿作进一步的努力，不召回它的全权代表，伦敦谈判完全有成功的可能。在第三次苏日谈判中，苏日经过双方友好和坦率的商谈，连当时进行谈判的日本全权代表日本外务相重光葵也认为苏日和约是可以签字了。但是，这时日本政府又突然改变主意，召回了重光葵，使苏日恢复正常关系的谈判第三次中断。这次，日本鸠山首相在比较清醒地考虑了日本国内外的整个形势，克服了各方的阻挠，亲往莫斯科进行谈判，终于同苏联政府代表团就恢复苏日两国邦交达成协议。鸠山首相采取的这种现实的态度，是符合于日本人民的利益和愿望的，当然会受到日本广大人民的支持和欢迎。
    苏日谈判终于能获得成功，苏联政府所一贯采取合情合理和积极的态度，起了极其重要的作用。在苏日谈判的整个过程中，苏联政府照顾到日本方面的处境和愿望，始终采取耐心的和友好的态度，并且作了许多努力。现在事实再一次表明，苏联政府诚心诚意地奉行着它同所有国家进行友好合作的和平外交政策。从苏日两国关于恢复邦交的联合宣言中也可以看出，双方所达成的各项协议，许多问题是在对等的基础上求得解决的，但是有许多问题的解决，是经苏联政府对日本方面作了很大的让步才取得协议的。例如领土问题、释放日本战犯问题、渔业问题、支持日本加入联合国问题等都是这样。日本外务省人士19日在评论苏日谈判达成协议一事的时候也认为，“苏联已经考虑日本的立场”。苏联政府和人民对待日本的这种合情合理的友好态度，已经得到各国舆论的普遍赞扬。
    战后十一年来，美国政府曾千方百计地阻挠日本同它的两大邻国——苏联和中国恢复正常关系。美国这种作法，目的是在使日本不能走上独立自主的道路，以便它长期占领日本，把日本变成它的殖民地和侵略战争基地，同时企图借此保持远东的紧张局势。这就是为什么在苏日谈判的整个期间，美国一直表示不安和想方设法要阻挠苏日恢复邦交的原因。因此，苏日两国决定恢复邦交，不仅为两国开辟了友好合作的道路，同时也将有利于日本的独立发展，有利于加强远东的和平。苏日谈判终于获得成功这一事实也证明，苏日两国人民要求恢复正常关系、进行友好合作的意志，是任何力量也阻拦不住的。
    现在美国政府当局破坏苏日谈判的企图是失败了；但是，有迹象证明它的下一个步骤，必然要加紧阻碍中日两国关系的正常化。日本人民要求恢复同中国的正常关系的呼声，这些年来也一直在不断高涨。因为中日关系的正常化，是符合日本人民的最大利益的。正如日本社会党在19日讨论了日苏谈判问题后发表的声明中说：由于日苏恢复邦交，日本的外交政策已经进入了一个大转变的时期，今后应该尽速实现同中国恢复邦交。这是表达了日本人民衷心愿望的有力的呼声，美国力图加紧阻挠中日友好关系向前发展的阴谋，最后也注定是要遭受失败的。
    中国人民十分同情日本人民在战后的处境，热烈地希望它能同一切国家友好相处，从而促进它的独立发展。中国人民在衷心地祝贺日本和苏联恢复邦交的同时，诚恳地希望中日两国之间也能够早日恢复正常关系。我们相信，只要中日双方都抱着真诚和友好的态度，并且都切实地采取积极的措施，两国邦交的恢复也是可以实现的。
