Lu Xun has been dead for a full twenty years.

In these twenty years, the world has undergone great changes, and China has undergone epoch-making changes.

In 1937, the year after Lu Xun's death, the Japanese imperialists launched a large-scale war of aggression against China, which lasted for eight years. Half of China's territory was once occupied, and many lives and properties were sacrificed, but the Japanese imperialists were finally defeated and surrendered in 1945.

In 1939, the third year after Lu Xun's death, Nazi Germany launched World War II, which lasted for six years. Thanks to the joint efforts of the people of the world, especially the heroic resistance of the Soviet people and the Soviet armed forces, Nazi Germany and the fascist Axis powers were finally defeated in 1945, saving mankind from the catastrophe of great destruction.

In 1949, the twelfth year after Lu Xun's death, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, after eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and four years of the People's Revolutionary War, finally defeated the Japanese imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek counter-revolutionary group strongly supported by American imperialism. The imperialist aggressor forces, which had gradually controlled China's lifeline for a hundred years, were expelled, and the People's Republic of China, a people's democratic dictatorship, was established.

The victory of the world's people's anti-fascist war, the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, and the increasing consolidation and growth of the world peace, democracy, and socialist camp that followed these victories, as well as the rapid development of the Chinese people in socialist construction and socialist transformation, these changes in the twenty years after Lu Xun's death are all major events of world significance, related to the destiny of all mankind.

Lu Xun had longed for these changes to occur during his lifetime, and especially in his later years, he had selflessly struggled for these changes to occur. "When drinking water, remember the source." We cannot but affirm Lu Xun's achievements and contributions. We must commemorate him, study him, learn from him, and inherit his unfinished work to further develop it.

Lu Xun's achievements are similar to those of the giants of the European Renaissance, and are multifaceted.

He was a revolutionary thinker, an epoch-making literary writer, a pragmatic historical scientist, an exemplary educator, and an internationalist who longed for the liberation of mankind.

Achievements in each of these aspects can make Lu Xun immortal, and he harmoniously concentrated the immortal achievements in various aspects, crystallizing them into a typical personality. His influence will undoubtedly become more and more significant, more and more extensive, and more and more profound.

Lu Xun was initially a believer in evolutionism. He studied biology and modern medicine, and he was a patriotic materialist. He waged a relentless struggle against the feudal ideas of the old era, and also waged a relentless struggle against colonialism and the ideas of the comprador bourgeoisie.

The end result of his thought was not to be satisfied with explaining the objective world, but to transform the objective world. Therefore, his own struggle practice, especially after the Great October Socialist Revolution, and the influence of the Chinese revolutionary movement on him, gradually made him realize the truth of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and he became a firm Marxist and an active supporter of the Chinese Communist Party, which led the Chinese revolution.

Lu Xun was the founder and pioneer of revolutionary new literature.

In a long-stagnant feudal society, the dross of feudalism accumulated layer upon layer, and moreover, the constant hailstorm of colonialist cultural aggression, Lu Xun, as a writer, was the one who first brought forth the tender seedlings of new literature from the ground.

"Bearing the burden of inheritance, shouldering the gate of darkness, and letting them go to a broad and bright place; from then on, live happily and be reasonable people." ("Grave")

These words are what Lu Xun taught "How We Should Be Fathers Now," but if they are applied to Lu Xun's creation of new literature, I think they are equally appropriate. This giant-like effort can be expressed by ancient Chinese mythology, and is very similar to the distress of Pangu, the creator of heaven and earth.

Today, we must use refined people's language to engage in writing, and to write outstanding novels, poems, plays, and essays, it will naturally still require dedicated effort. However, the conditions for writing today are incomparable to those of the era when Lu Xun began to engage in creation decades ago. But even today, it is not an easy task for us to reach Lu Xun's level in literary creation.

As a realist writer, Lu Xun's appearance was epoch-making, and he will always be a peak in literary history.

Lu Xun was an innovator of national culture, but he was by no means a nihilist of national culture. He had a deep understanding of the essence of national culture. He was a pragmatic and erudite historical scientist.

"A Brief History of Chinese Fiction," this immortal work is unprecedented. In addition, the research, criticism, collation, and dissemination of historical documents all concretely demonstrate his pragmatic spirit—a serious scientific attitude.

Lu Xun was a person who had received modern natural science training, and also inherited the excellent traditions of the Qian-Jia School of the Qing Dynasty. He cleverly combined these two, which gave him the full conditions to be able to elucidate the democratic essence of national culture.

No one can forget that Lu Xun was also an outstanding educator. Since he ended his student life in his early years, he had been engaged in education. Only after Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution in 1927, did he leave the educational position because he was persecuted by the reactionaries.

Lu Xun had always loved new forces. The last sentence of the famous "Diary of a Madman": "Save the children," this is the most painful cry from the dark age.

"Bearing the burden of inheritance, shouldering the gate of darkness, and letting them go to a broad and bright place; from then on, live happily and be reasonable people."

I want to quote these few words again. This not only expresses Lu Xun's call for "How We Should Be Fathers Now," but also expresses Lu Xun's call for "How We Should Be Teachers Now."

"Fiercely browed, I coolly face a thousand pointing fingers, head bowed, I willingly serve as an ox for the children." - These two widely popular lines of poetry also express the same spirit, and are a self-portrait of Lu Xun as an educator.

He also said this very simple and profound thing: "The cow eats grass, but squeezes out milk." We cannot but admire this spirit of self-sacrifice, which encapsulates the creative process.

Creatively engaging in creation, research, education, and nurturing the new generation with a spirit of self-sacrifice is Lu Xun's noble life practice. His life is also a model of being a human being. He was a great educator who led by example.

In order to create new forms of Chinese literature and art, an indispensable path is to translate foreign works. Lu Xun noticed this in his youth, and he did a lot of translation work. However, he had a special tendency in his translation work, that is, he liked to select and translate the works of oppressed or small nations. Lu Xun himself explained that he was particularly sympathetic to small nations. Here, the seeds of his anti-imperialist thought were already expressed.

After the October Revolution, as Lu Xun's thought was given a clear direction, he "firmly believed that a classless society must be realized." Especially in the decade after the failure of the "Great Revolution" in 1927 until his death, he waged an unyielding struggle against reactionary forces at home and abroad. Lu Xun became an indisputable, shining internationalist who longed for the liberation of mankind.

Just in terms of the exchange of literary and artistic experience, Lu Xun's translations enriched China's new literature and art. Conversely, Lu Xun's creation enriched the world's literature and art. Lu Xun is no longer simply China's Lu Xun, but the world's Lu Xun. Today, we welcome representatives from the cultural circles of more than twenty countries to jointly commemorate the 20th anniversary of Lu Xun's death, which is excellent proof.

The Chinese people love peace and labor, and the Chinese people are good at absorbing the excellent cultural achievements of various countries in the world to nourish themselves, and thereby strive to create and promote common progress. Lu Xun fully embodies this traditional spirit, and we Chinese cultural workers must follow him to develop China's new culture in this direction.

We deeply feel that cultural workers from all over the world have ardent expectations for the Chinese people and Chinese cultural workers, that is, hoping that China's new culture can make more contributions to world culture, and hoping that China can produce more Lu Xuns.

We are willing to accept this expectation and are willing to guarantee that we will not fail this expectation. Today, under the people's democratic regime, we are also looking forward to "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" in the garden of cultural activities. Excellent conditions are fully available, only waiting for the collective and individual efforts of cultural workers.

We are commemorating Lu Xun today. We Chinese cultural workers must take Lu Xun as an example and creatively engage in all activities with a spirit of self-sacrifice. We must inherit the excellent heritage of our motherland, and at the same time, we must learn from the outstanding cultures of various countries in the world, strive to create a new Chinese national culture, serve the people's happiness, serve the construction of the motherland, and serve the progress of mankind.

Finally, please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese people and Chinese cultural workers, to express my heartfelt respect and gratitude to the representatives of various countries who have come from afar to participate in this commemorative meeting. We wish you continued brilliant achievements in your cultural activities. We hope to express our sincere friendship and blessings to the cultural circles and people of the countries you represent through you.

We are willing to join hands closely with cultural workers from all over the world and work together to improve human culture and defend world peace.

    在首都的鲁迅逝世二十周年纪念大会上
    郭沫若的开幕词
    鲁迅逝世整整二十周年了。
    在这二十年当中，世界起了很大的变化，中国更起了划时代的变化。
    在鲁迅逝世后的第二年，1937年7月，日本帝国主义发动了大规模的侵华战争，绵延了八年之久。中国国土的一半曾经沦陷，并牺牲了不少的生命财产，但日本帝国主义终于在1945年被击败而投降了。
    在鲁迅逝世后的第三年，1939年9月，纳粹德国更发动了第二次世界大战，绵延了六年之久。靠着世界人民的共同努力，特别是苏联人民和苏联武装力量的英勇抗战，终于在1945年击溃了纳粹德国和法西斯轴心集团，把人类从大破灭的灾难中挽救了转来。
    在鲁迅逝世后的第十二年，中国人民在中国共产党领导下，经过了八年的抗日战争，更经过了四年的人民革命战争，终于在1949年在击败了日本帝国主义之后，又击败了美帝国主义所大力支持的蒋介石反革命集团，驱逐了一百年来逐步地控制了中国命脉的帝国主义侵略势力，而建立了人民民主专政的中华人民共和国。
    世界人民反法西斯战争的胜利，中国人民革命的胜利，和随着这些胜利而来的世界和平、民主，社会主义阵营的日益巩固和壮大，中国人民在社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业中的突飞猛进的发展，在鲁迅逝世后二十年间的这些变化，都是具有世界意义的、关系着全人类命运的重大事件。
    鲁迅生平曾经渴望着这些变化的出现，特别在他的晚年更曾经为这些变化的出现而忘我地斗争。“饮水思源”，我们不能不肯定鲁迅的成就和劳绩。我们要纪念他，研究他，学习他，把他没有做完的工作继承起来，更进一步向前发展。
    鲁迅的成就，和欧洲文艺复兴时期的巨人们相仿佛，是多方面的。
    他是革命的思想家，是划时代的文艺作家，是实事求是的历史科学家，是以身作则的教育家，是渴望人类解放的国际主义者。
    这在每一方面的成就都可以使鲁迅不朽，而他是把各方面的不朽的成就相互谐适地集中起来，结晶成为一个典型的人格。他的影响毫无疑问，是将愈来愈显著，愈来愈广泛，愈来愈深入的。
    鲁迅起初是一位进化论的信徒。他研究过生物学和近代医学，他是一位爱国的唯物主义者。他和旧时代的封建思想作了毫不容情的斗争，更和殖民主义和买办资产阶级的思想也作了毫不容情的斗争。
    他的思想的归趋并不是满足于说明客观世界，而是要改造客观世界。因此，他自己的斗争实践，特别是在伟大的十月社会主义革命以后，中国革命运动对于他的影响，使他逐渐体会到辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的真理，而成为了坚定的马克思主义者，成为了领导中国革命的中国共产党的积极支持者。
    鲁迅是革命的新文艺的创始人和奠基者。
    在长期停滞的封建社会中，封建性的糟粕陈陈相因地积压着，更加上殖民主义文化侵略不断的大冰雹，作为作家的鲁迅，是他开始把新文艺的嫩苗从地底迸射了出来。
    “背着因袭的重担，肩住了黑暗的闸门，放他们到宽阔光明的地方去；此后幸福的度日，合理的做人。”（“坟”）
    这话是鲁迅教“我们现在怎样做父亲”，但如果移用到鲁迅对于新文艺的创作上来，我觉得是同样切合的。这种巨人式的努力，可以借中国古代的神话来表示，是十分类似于开天辟地者盘古的苦闷。
    在今天，我们要用经过洗炼的人民语言来从事写作，要写出杰出的小说、诗歌、剧本、杂文，自然也还是要费献身的努力。但在今天的写作条件，和鲁迅在几十年前开始从事创作的时代相比，是不可同日而语了。但在今天，我们在文艺创作上要想达到鲁迅的水平却还不是一件容易的事。
    作为现实主义的作家，鲁迅的出现是划时代的，而且他将永远成为文艺史上的一个高峰。
    鲁迅是民族文化的革新者，但他决不是民族文化的虚无主义者。他对于民族文化的精华具有深厚的素养。他是一位实事求是的渊博的历史科学家。
    “中国小说史略”这部不朽的著作是前无古人的。在这之外，有关历史文献的研究、批评、整理、传播，都具体地表示着他的实事求是精神——严肃的科学家态度。
    鲁迅是受过近代自然科学训练的人，而又继承了清代乾嘉学派的优良传统，他把这两者巧妙地结合了起来，这就使他具有着充分的条件能够阐发出民族文化的民主性的精华。
    谁也不能忘记鲁迅同时还是一位卓越的教育家。从他早年结束学生生活以后，他就一直从事教育工作。只有在1927年蒋介石出卖革命以后，他受着反动派的迫害才离开了教育岗位。
    鲁迅一直是爱护新生力量的，有名的“狂人日记”最后的一句话：“救救孩子”，这是从黑暗时代中叫出的最沉痛的呼声。
    “背着因袭的重担，肩住了黑暗的闸门，放他们到宽阔光明的地方去；此后幸福的度日，合理的做人”。
    这几句话我要再引用一遍。这不仅表示着鲁迅叫“我们现在怎样做父亲”，而也表示着鲁迅叫“我们现在怎样做老师”。
    “横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”。——十分脍炙人口的这两句诗也正表示着同样的精神，是作为教育家的鲁迅的自画像。
    他也说过这样十分浅显、而又十分深刻的话：“牛，吃的是草，挤出的是奶”。这种概括着创造过程在里面的自我牺牲精神，我们是不能不赞仰的。
    以自我牺牲精神创造性地从事创作，从事研究，从事教育，从事哺育新生代，是鲁迅生平的高贵的生活实践。他的一生也正是做人的一个模范。他是一位以身作则的伟大的教育家。
    为了创造中国文艺的新形式，一个不可忽视的途径，是翻译外国的作品。鲁迅在年青的时候就曾经注意到这一层，他是做了不少的翻译工作的。但是，他在翻译工作中有一个特出的倾向，便是他喜欢选译被压迫民族或弱小民族的作品。鲁迅曾经自行说明，他是特别同情弱小民族的。在这里已经表示着他的反对帝国主义的思想的萌芽。
    十月革命以后，随着鲁迅思想被赋与了明确的方向性，他“确切地相信无阶级社会一定要实现”，特别是在1927年“大革命”失败以后，到他去世的十年间，他对国内外的反动势力作了不屈不挠的斗争。鲁迅成为了无可争辩的有光辉的渴望人类解放的国际主义者。
    单就文艺经验的交流上来说吧，鲁迅的翻译丰富了中国的新文艺。反过来，鲁迅的创作又使中国的新文艺丰富了世界文艺。鲁迅已不单纯是中国的鲁迅，而是世界的鲁迅了。在今天我们迎接到二十多个国家文化界的代表来共同纪念鲁迅逝世二十周年，便是绝好的证明。
    中国人民酷爱和平劳动，中国人民善于吸收世界各国优秀的文化成果来营养自己，更从而努力创造、促进共同进步。鲁迅正充分地体现了这种传统精神，我们中国的文化工作者更要跟踪着他使中国新文化向着这个方向发展。
    我们深切地感受到世界各国的文化工作者对于中国人民和中国文化工作者有着殷切的期待，便是希望中国的新文化能够对世界文化有更多的贡献，希望中国能够产生出更多的鲁迅。
    我们愿意接受这个期待，并愿意保证不辜负这个期待。在今天人民民主的政权下，我们在文化活动的园地里也正期待着“百花齐放，百家争鸣”。优良的条件是充分具备着的，就只等待着文化工作者集体的和个人的最紧张的努力。
    我们今天在纪念鲁迅。我们中国的文化工作者就是要以鲁迅为榜样，以自我牺牲精神创造性地从事一切活动。我们要继承祖国的优良遗产，同时也要学习世界各国的优秀文化，努力创造中华民族新文化，为人民幸福服务，为祖国建设服务，为人类进步服务。
    最后，请允许我代表中国人民和中国文化工作者对远来参加这个纪念大会的各国代表表示衷心的敬意和感谢。我们祝你们在文化活动中不断地获得有光辉的成就。我们希望通过你们，向你们所代表的各国的文化界和各国人民表示诚恳的友谊和祝福。
    我们愿和世界各国的文化工作者紧密地携起手来，为提高人类文化、保卫世界和平而共同努力。
