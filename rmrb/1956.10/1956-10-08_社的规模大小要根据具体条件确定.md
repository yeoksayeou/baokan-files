    The size of a cooperative should be determined based on specific conditions
    Huang Yan, Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    In the process of agricultural cooperatives transitioning from elementary to advanced, the issue of cooperative size needs to be carefully studied in order to better organize production. Regarding this issue, two tendencies have emerged among cadres in our province. One is the tendency to "fear bigness," and the other is the tendency to "covet bigness." Both find their own reasons from different perspectives. Those who "fear bigness" say, "Small cooperatives are like monkeys, big cooperatives are like oxen," and "If the cooperative is too big, the rich villages and poor villages will be combined, and the rich villages will suffer losses, and the contradictions between the rich and poor villages will be difficult to resolve." The conclusion is: "Big is not as good as small." Those who "covet bigness" say, "The bigger the cooperative, the better," and "Fewer units are easier to lead, and more land and more people can unleash potential." The conclusion is: "Big is better than small." We believe that both of these views are one-sided. The former only considers the aspect of facilitating the production management of the cooperative, while ignoring the needs of production. The latter blindly "compares big" and "covets big" without considering the specific conditions. In order to correctly solve the organizational construction of cooperatives, we criticized these two tendencies. We believe that the Anhui region is not only divided into mountainous areas, hilly areas, plains areas, and polder areas, but also in the same type of area, its production conditions, water conservancy systems, mass requirements, and historical conditions have different characteristics. The issue of cooperative size must be based on these different specific conditions, comprehensively considering the principles of being conducive to production, conducive to unity, and convenient for leadership and management, and be determined in a pragmatic manner. Of course, general regulations are necessary, but we must not blindly affirm the size of cooperatives without considering objective conditions.
    The scale of cooperatives in our province varies in size. There are small cooperatives with dozens of households, and large cooperatives with more than a thousand households, and some individual cooperatives with more than five thousand households. Cooperatives in mountainous areas, hilly areas, and sparsely populated areas are smaller. Polder areas require better drainage and irrigation, disaster-prone areas require struggles against natural disasters, and densely populated areas require people to organize and reclaim wasteland, so they all want to make the cooperatives bigger. These large cooperatives are all voluntary by the masses, especially in the case of building water conservancy projects and fighting against disasters, they have shown their superiority and increased crop yields, so they are all united. This also proves that it is necessary to make cooperatives bigger in areas where conditions permit. For example, the Shuangqiao Cooperative in Xuancheng is the best example to illustrate this situation. The cooperative has 5,071 households, and the land is all included in the Tonggong Dam irrigation system. Before the cooperative was established, the upper reaches would be flooded if the gates were opened, and the lower reaches would be dry if the gates were closed. Villages argued with each other every year. Later, several small cooperatives were established, but the water use contradictions were still not resolved, only changing the dispute from village to village to cooperative to cooperative. This spring, the local party committee, based on the demands of the masses, proceeded from specific production conditions, and after careful research and planning, established such a large cooperative, which relatively thoroughly resolved the water conservancy disputes and achieved the goal of being conducive to production and conducive to unity. This summer, the cooperative's polder area was flooded four times; however, due to the concerted efforts to launch drainage operations, the disaster was greatly reduced. The members said in unison: "In the past, we just watched small disasters, but now we can resist big disasters." Because of this, the entire cooperative was able to increase production by 14% despite the disaster, and more than 90% of the members were still able to increase their income. The so-called difference between "rich villages and poor villages" did not become a problem because of the general increase in production. Only in the initial short period of time did some difficulties occur in production management; however, after a short period of exploration and after gaining experience, these difficult problems were gradually resolved. At present, the entire cooperative is united and consolidated. After this inspection of the Shuangqiao Cooperative, we further realized that solving the problem of the size of agricultural cooperatives still requires us to carry out our work in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings on strengthening investigation and research and seeking truth from facts, so as not to make "left" or right mistakes.

    社的规模大小要根据具体条件确定
    中共安徽省委书记　黄岩
    在农业社由初级到高级的转变过程中，为了更好的组织生产，对社的规模大小的问题需要认真地加以研究。关于这个问题，在我省干部中曾发生过两种倾向。一种是“怕大”的倾向；另一种是“贪大”的倾向。两者各从不同的角度找出各自的理由。“怕大”的说：“小社像猴，大社像牛”，“社办大了，富庄穷庄并在一起，富庄吃亏，穷富庄矛盾不好解决。”结论是：“大不如小”。“贪大”的说：“合作社愈大愈好”，“单位少，便于领导，地多人多能够发挥潜力。”结论是：“大比小好”。对这两种看法，我们认为都带有片面性。前者光考虑便于社的生产管理一面，忽视了生产需要的一面；后者不联系具体条件，盲目的“比大”、“贪大”。为了正确解决合作社的组织建设问题，我们批判了这两种倾向。我们认为，安徽地区不仅有山区、丘陵区、平原区及圩区之分，而且在同一类型地区，其生产条件、水利系统、群众要求、历史情况也存在着各不相同的特点；社的规模问题，必须根据这些不同的具体条件，全面地考虑到有利于生产，有利于团结，便利于领导管理等原则，实事求是地确定。当然，一般的规定是需要的，但决不能不顾客观条件，盲目地肯定社的大小规模。
    我省合作社的规模是大小不一的。有几十户的小社，有千户以上的、个别的还有五千户以上的大社。山区、丘陵区、地广人稀地区社办得小一些；圩田地区，由于排涝灌溉的要求突出，多灾地区，由于同自然灾害进行斗争的需要，人口稠密地区由于土地少，群众有组织力量向外开垦荒地的要求，所以都要求把社办大一些。这些大社因为都是出于群众的自愿，特别是在兴办水利工程和同灾害进行斗争的情况下表现了它们的优越性，增加了农作物的产量，所以都是团结的。这也证明了，在有条件的地区，把社办大一些是必要的。如宣城双桥合作社就是一个最能说明这种情况的例子。该社五千零七十一户，土地都包括在佟公坝一个灌溉系统之内。在办社以前，历年来，不是上边开闸下边涝，就是上边关闸下边旱，村和村之间年年争吵不休。后来办了几个小社，但用水矛盾仍未解决，只是由村和村争吵变为社和社争吵而已。今年春季，当地党委根据群众要求，从具体生产条件出发，经过认真地研究规划，办了这样一个大社，才比较彻底地解决了水利纠纷，达到了有利于生产、有利于团结的目的。今年夏季，该社圩田受涝四次；但是，由于同舟共济地齐心齐力地展开了排涝运动，因而大大减轻了灾害。社员不约而同地说：“从前小灾站着看，现在大灾能抵抗。”由于这个缘故，今年全社在受灾情况下仍能增产14％，90％以上的社员仍能增加收入。所谓“富庄穷庄”的差别，因为普遍增产了，也未发生问题。只是在最初一个短时期，生产管理上发生过一些困难；但是，经过一个短时间的摸索，在取得了经验之后，这些困难问题也就逐步地解决了。目前，全社是团结巩固的。经过这次对双桥社的检查，使我们进一步地认识到：解决农业社的规模大小问题，仍须按照毛泽东同志关于加强调查研究和实事求是的教导去进行工作，才不致于发生或“左”或右的错误。
