Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 21st: Soviet newspapers published a letter written by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Bulganin, to the President of the United States, Eisenhower, on October 17th, in which he called for the immediate conclusion of an agreement with the United States and other countries possessing atomic weapons to halt the testing of atomic weapons, as a first step towards discussing the solution to the problem of atomic weapons.

Bulganin said that the current situation of increasingly fierce competition among countries to produce atomic weapons is incompatible with the further relaxation of international tensions and the elimination of people's fear of atomic war. He said that even in the United States, the calls for avoiding the possible consequences of the current atomic arms race are becoming increasingly louder.

He said that the United States government has not yet found it possible to work towards prohibiting atomic weapons and striving for the conclusion of an international agreement in this regard. However, despite this, this does not mean that it is unnecessary to seek a partial solution to this problem, in order to facilitate future efforts to conclude an agreement that completely eliminates atomic weapons from national arsenals and uses atomic energy only for peaceful purposes. The outcome of these efforts largely depends on the attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union.

Bulganin suggested that, before reaching an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons, it would be best to start discussing the first step in solving the problem of atomic weapons now, in accordance with the suggestions he made in his letter to Eisenhower on September 11th of this year – the prohibition of testing atomic and hydrogen weapons. He said that once an agreement is reached on this issue, there will be no serious problems regarding the supervision of the implementation of this agreement, because at present it is impossible for any atomic bomb or hydrogen bomb explosion not to be recorded by other countries. Since secret testing of nuclear weapons is impossible, this can serve as the best guarantee against the violation of such an agreement.

Bulganin said that we completely agree with the views recently expressed by certain prominent figures in the United States, who believe that the conclusion of an agreement on the prohibition of testing atomic weapons is necessary and possible, and that doing so may have a positive impact on the overall international situation. Bulganin said that he noted Eisenhower's statement that the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons tests can only be resolved after the conclusion of an agreement on an entire disarmament plan. However, such an agreement is not yet ripe, as evidenced by the fact that the United States and certain other participants in the disarmament negotiations immediately withdrew their proposals whenever the Soviet Union accepted them. Given this, the solution to the issue of testing atomic weapons cannot be made subordinate to an agreement on the entire disarmament issue.

Bulganin said that therefore, the Soviet government hopes to immediately conclude an agreement with the United States to halt the testing of atomic weapons, and hopes that other countries possessing atomic weapons will also participate in this agreement.

    布尔加宁写信给艾森豪威尔
    要求缔结停止试验原子武器的协定
    作为着手解决禁止原子武器问题的第一步
    新华社莫斯科21日电　苏联报纸发表了苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在10月17日写给美国总统艾森豪威尔的一封信，其中要求立即同美国以及其他拥有原子武器的国家缔结一个停止试验原子武器的协定，作为着手商谈解决原子武器问题的第一步。
    布尔加宁说，目前各国愈来愈激烈地竞相生产原子武器的形势同进一步缓和国际紧张局势和解除人民对原子战争的恐惧是不相容的。他说，就是在美国，要求避免目前的原子军备竞赛的可能后果的呼声也愈来愈强烈了。
    他说，美国政府直到目前还没有认为有可能为禁止原子武器和争取签订关于这方面的国际协定而努力。但是尽管这样，这并不是说就用不着为这个问题求得部分解决，以利于将来签订完全从国家武器储备中取消原子武器，使原子能只用于和平目的的协定而进行努力。而这种努力的结果如何，在很大程度上决定于美国和苏联的态度。
    布尔加宁建议，在就禁止原子武器问题达成协议以前，最好按照他在今年9月11日给艾森豪威尔的信中所提的建议，现在就着手商谈解决原子武器问题的第一步——禁止试验原子武器和氢武器的问题。他说，一旦就这个问题达成协议，关于监督这个协议的执行是不会产生什么严重问题的，因为目前任何一个原子弹和氢弹的爆炸要不给其他国家记录下来是不可能的。秘密试验核子武器既然是不可能的，这就可以成为防止这种协定被破坏的最好保证。
    布尔加宁说，我们完全同意最近美国某些有名人士所表示的意见，他们认为缔结禁止试验原子武器问题的协定是必要的和可能的，认为这样做可能对整个国际局势有良好影响。布尔加宁说，他注意到艾森豪威尔所说的，禁止试验原子武器问题只有在缔结关于整个裁军计划的协定后才能解决。但是，这种协定目前还不成熟，一个证据就是，美国和裁军谈判的某些其他参加国每当苏联接受它们的建议的时候，就马上撤回了自己的建议。既然如此，就不能使关于试验原子武器问题的解决附属于整个裁军问题的协定。
    布尔加宁说，因此苏联政府希望立刻同美国缔结一个停止试验原子武器的协定，并且希望其他拥有原子武器的国家也参加这个协定。
