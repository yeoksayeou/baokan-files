    Difficulty in Making Clothes

    Editor's Note: Recently, this newspaper has continuously received letters from readers across the country reflecting the great difficulty in getting clothes made. With winter approaching, making winter clothes is a pressing issue that affects the lives of the broad masses. Beijing has already begun to address this problem, and has stipulated in principle that processing time should not exceed half a month. It is hoped that other regions, especially large and medium-sized cities, will solve this problem as soon as possible.

    The Worries of Out-of-Town Workers

    In Taiyuan City, it now takes almost two months to get a cotton-padded coat made. This affects many people, especially new workers and students from other places who have come to Taiyuan. Our school has many students recruited from the Northeast this year, and they are worried, saying: "Our families haven't sent the money for making cotton-padded clothes yet. By the time the money arrives, we buy the cloth, and get the cotton-padded clothes made, it will almost be spring." We hope that the relevant departments in Taiyuan City will find a way to solve this problem.　　Huang Huiwang

    Problems with Production Organization

    In Harbin City, it is not certain you can get clothes made even if you visit over ten sewing production cooperatives. Most production cooperatives do not accept custom orders for small jobs, and the few that do accept them say they are too busy and do not accept them. If they reluctantly accept it after much persuasion, it will take at least a month or two to pick up the clothes.

    Where is the problem? According to our understanding, the key lies in the problems with the production organization of the sewing production cooperatives. After cooperativization, many service points that originally undertook custom orders for small jobs were shut down due to the adoption of centralized organization methods. After centralization, most are afraid of trouble and unwilling to undertake custom orders for small jobs. They only process for commercial departments, so the broad masses can only complain about the difficulty of getting clothes made. At the same time, before cooperativization, the clothing processing industry used to work overtime during the busy seasons of seasonal changes, and the utilization rate of sewing machines was very high. Now, however, it is still one shift, and people go to and leave work on time, so the production capacity has naturally decreased a lot.　　Xiao Han

    The Great Journey of Clothing Materials

    Recently, the weather in Shenyang has been getting colder, and Southerners who are coming to the Northeast for the first time naturally want to prepare well for this first winter. I took advantage of the holiday to buy materials for making cotton-padded clothes, thinking that I could wear winter clothes in just a week or two. However, the reality is far from ideal!

    I visited each sewing production cooperative along the most prosperous Taiyuan Street and the nearby streets, only to receive the following replies:

    "We only make clothes from woolen materials here. Take the cloth clothes to another place."

    "We are only responsible for processing leather goods, and cannot take on other work."

    "We don't have time to take your order." "Today is a holiday, we don't take orders."

    "It is not certain whether the clothes can be delivered by the end of next month."

    As a result, I had no choice but to return to the outside of the city with a large package.

    The following Sunday, I went to the second commercial center of Shenyang - Zhongjie area - with a full backpack. I walked street after street, and even the sewing cooperatives in the alleys were not spared. In addition to hearing the same answers as last time, I also heard some seemingly more sufficient reasons for refusing to make clothes: some only make uniforms, some specialize in making shirts, some said they could make cotton-padded clothes but not silk-padded ones, and some specialize in processing for department stores. Finally, a female member of a sewing cooperative told me: "Now it's different from the days when we worked individually. In the past, we would accept any kind of clothing to make, but now that we have cooperativization, each cooperative has certain regulations and specializes in sewing a certain type of clothing. We can't do things haphazardly, this is called socialist division of labor!" Oh! That's how it is, I suddenly understood.

    In the end, there was really no other way, so I had to spend a few yuan on postage and send the clothing materials and cotton back to the South to make them. It is estimated that I will be able to wear them in more than twenty days.

### 做衣难

专栏：读者来信

    做衣难
    编者按　这些天本报不断收到各地读者来信，反映作衣服十分困难，特别是冬天将到，作寒衣已经关系到广大群众生活的迫切问题。目前北京市已经着手解决这个问题，原则上规定加工时间不超过半月。希望其它地区，特别是大、中城市，应该即早解决这个问题。
    外来职工的忧愁
    现在，太原市做一件棉衣差不多都得要两个月左右的时间。这是关系着很多人特别是外地新来太原的职工学生过冬的问题，我们学校今年有很多东北招来的学生，现在正在发愁，他们说：“现在家里还没把做棉衣的钱寄来，等到钱寄来，买好布，做好棉衣，差不多快到春天了。”希望太原市有关方面设法解决。　　黄恢望
    生产组织有问题
    在哈尔滨市做一件衣服，跑上十几个缝纫生产社，也不见得能办妥。大多数生产社不接受订做零活，很少的几个接做零活的社又推说活多而不受理，如果好说歹说的收下了，至少也得一两月以后才能取衣服。
    问题在那里呢？据我们了解，关键是在于缝纫生产社的生产组织有问题。合作化以后，由于采取了集中组织起来的办法，撤销了不少原来承揽零活的服务点；而集中了以后，大部分又怕麻烦，不愿承揽零活。只为商业部门加工，所以广大群众要做衣服只能告苦。同时在合作化以前，到了换季活忙的季节，服装加工业多加班加点，缝纫机的利用率很高。现在则仍是一班，并按时上下班，当然生产能力就下降多了。　　晓寒
    衣料大旅行
    近来沈阳天气渐冷，初次到东北来的南方人对这第一个冬天当然要作好准备。我趁着假日买了做棉衣的材料，以为只要再过一两星期便可穿上冬衣，然而，实际远非理想啊！
    我沿着最繁华的太原街及其附近几条大街，挨户拜访了各缝纫生产合作社，只是得到这样的答复：
    “这儿是专做呢绒料子衣服的，做布衣拿到旁的地方去吧。”
    “我们只负责皮货加工，其他的活不能接。”
    “没有工夫接你的。”“今天，休假，不接活。”
    “下月底是否能交衣可不肯定。”
    结果只有悻悻然仍抱着一大包转回城外。
    下一个星期天，我又背了满盛的背袋，到沈阳第二个商业中心——中街一带去。走了一条街又一条街，即使连位在胡同里的缝纫社都没有拉下，除了听到和上次同样的回答外，还听到了一些似乎更充足的拒绝做衣的理由：有的只做制服，有的专做衬衣，有的说可做棉衣但不做丝棉的，有的专为百货公司加工。末了，一位缝纫社的女社员告诉我：“现在可不同从前单干时候啦，以前是什么衣服都接做，而今合作化了，各个社都有一定的规定，专缝制某一类服装，不能乱做，这样才叫做社会主义的分工呀！”哦！原来如此，我才恍然大悟。
    最后，实在无法可想，只有花上几元邮费，把衣料和棉花寄回南方去做吧，估计二十多天后便可以穿上了。
