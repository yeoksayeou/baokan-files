Vast Quantities of Supplies Transported to Hebei Disaster Areas

(Report from this newspaper) In order to support farmers in the disaster areas of Hebei Province in their efforts to resume production, the Ministry of Agricultural Products Procurement has decided to allocate 8 million jin of ginned cotton and more than 443,000 jin of animal product raw materials to support key disaster areas in developing sideline production.

Hebei Province has suffered severe flooding this year. In order to solve the problem of winter clothing for disaster victims and support them in carrying out textile production, the state has allocated a large amount of cotton. Animal products can be used for hand-spun woolen yarn, felt-making, carpet weaving, bag weaving, and processing into export commodities, increasing the income of disaster victims. (Yao Hanjie)

Inner Mongolia Transfers Large Quantities of Grain

(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The first batch of 12,900+ tons of grain out of the 20,000 tons that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is providing to support disaster areas in Hebei Province has begun to be transported to Tianjin, Cangxian, Baoding, and other places in Hebei Province. This grain includes wheat, millet, sorghum rice, and buckwheat, among other types.

This year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has reaped an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain crops and will successively transfer large quantities of grain to support various regions.

Actively Purchase Native and Special Products from Disaster Areas

(Report from this newspaper) Supply and marketing cooperatives in areas of Hunan Province that have suffered severe drought are expanding the purchase of native and special products from disaster victims, actively supporting farmers in their efforts to resume production. In late August, supply and marketing cooperatives in various disaster-stricken counties formulated plans to increase the variety and quantity of purchases. Supply and marketing cooperatives in the twelve counties of the Shaoyang Special District have increased the funds in their purchasing plan for the fourth quarter of this year by 820,000 yuan. The supply and marketing cooperatives in Fenghuang, Luxi, and Jishou counties of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture have recently added nine special stores for purchasing native and special products. The Xinhua County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shaoyang Special District is training 80 business personnel to purchase native and special products.

Many supply and marketing cooperatives have now signed combination contracts with agricultural cooperatives to help agricultural cooperatives carry out sideline production. The Baiguo District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hengshan County recently revised its combination contracts with agricultural cooperatives, increasing the purchase funds by more than 39,000 yuan.

In order to strengthen its leadership over grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in disaster areas, the Hunan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative dispatched five work groups to disaster areas in early September to conduct investigations and research. A comprehensive plan by the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative to coordinate with disaster areas in resuming production is being drafted.

Donating Winter Clothing and Monetary Contributions

(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The entire officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are extremely concerned about the people in disaster areas. In addition to dispatching troops in a timely manner to assist the masses in rescue efforts, they have also decided to allocate nearly 500,000 pieces of cotton clothing, cotton quilts, single-layer clothing, lined clothing, and shoes and hats to donate to the people in disaster areas, helping them to safely survive the severe winter. The General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has sent personnel to the Central Disaster Relief Committee to jointly discuss the distribution plan for the above-mentioned materials to various provinces.

Staff members of organizations directly under the Henan provincial government and organizations affiliated with Zhengzhou City are actively launching activities to donate winter clothing and monetary contributions to support the people in disaster areas. From August 25th to September 12th, according to incomplete statistics from 32 units, 7,339 pieces of cotton clothing, single-layer clothing, cloth, shoes, socks, hats, etc., and 6,286 yuan in monetary contributions have been donated.
