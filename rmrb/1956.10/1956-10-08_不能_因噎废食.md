Don't "Stop Eating Because of Choking"
　　Huang Xiangqing

Some time ago, I went to the Zhanjiang area of Guangdong to understand the situation of late rice production. This area vigorously promoted the reform of cultivation techniques during the early rice cultivation, which increased the early rice yield by about 20% in the entire area. Logically speaking, since the technical reform of early rice had some successful experiences, the late rice should be done even better. However, the situation was quite the opposite, and all technical measures were abandoned during the late rice cultivation. For example, many late rice fields in Leizhou County only had 20 dan of base fertilizer applied per mu, and some had no fertilizer at all; many agricultural cooperatives in Lianjiang County did not even do the basic seed selection; some areas in Suixi County even changed the fields that had been transplanted for years to backward broadcasting.

Why did this phenomenon occur? This has to be explained from the beginning:

It turned out that in the process of technical reform this spring, varying degrees of coercion and commandism occurred in many places. For example, some members of the Leizhou County Party Committee insisted on requiring branches to promote technical reforms without publicizing and explaining to farmers, and some even said to the farmers: "Whoever does not reform is opposing socialism." As a result, many practices that violated local conditions occurred. In Nantian Cooperative of Haikang County, more than 600 mu of rice fields that were changed from broadcasting to transplanting or spot planting had 385 mu of fields that farmers reluctantly plowed up due to lack of water conservancy conditions. Because of the promotion of early planting, farmers in Lianjiang County had to harvest tobacco leaves and sweet potatoes that should not have been harvested yet. According to preliminary statistics from seven counties and the suburbs of Zhanjiang City, more than 50,000 mu were reduced in production due to this erroneous practice, of which Lianjiang County lost 2.8 million jin of rice.

Of course, in those places where it was done better, the technical reform still played a good role, and the reduction in production was only in some areas where blind and reckless changes were made.

At the Party Congresses held in various counties, the representatives sharply criticized this blind and reckless style of coercion and commandism.

Criticism was originally intended to correct mistakes, not to correct the parts that were done correctly. Unfortunately, some cadres did not correctly understand the spirit of this criticism, and after the meeting, such arguments appeared: "We committed subjectivism and commandism in the technical reform of early rice, so let the masses do it themselves in the late rice!" "What reforms are we doing? We can't stand another Party Congress," "The more you do, the more mistakes you make; the less you do, the fewer mistakes you make." Many cadres accepted a "smart" lesson in this way, and the laissez-faire phenomenon of late rice technical reform occurred. There is a Chinese saying called "stopping eating because of choking." It is very appropriate to use this sentence to describe this kind of thinking and practice.

Of course, this phenomenon cannot be said to have become a trend, but judging from the situation in some areas, it is enough to raise vigilance. If we continue to regard this "stupid" idea as "smart," and continue to let things go, and do not put more effort into the field management work before the autumn harvest to make up for the past shortcomings, then it will be truly called going from mistake to mistake, and one mistake after another!

    不能“因噎废食”
　　黄向青
    前些时我到广东湛江地区了解晚造生产情况。这个地区在早造栽培时曾大力推广了耕作技术的改革，使全区早稻增产了二成左右。按理说，早造技术改革既已有了些成功的经验，晚造就会作得更好。但是，情况恰恰相反，晚造栽培时各种技术措施都放弃了。如雷东县许多晚造田每亩只下了二十担基肥，有的一担肥也没下；廉江县许多农业社连起码的选种也没做；遂溪县有些地区甚至把历年实行插秧的田改为落后的撒播。
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？这得从头说：
    原来在今春技术改革的过程中，有不少地方发生了程度不等的强迫命令现象。如雷东县有些区委委员不经过向农民宣传解释，就硬行要求支部推广技术改革，有的甚至对农民说：“谁不改就是反对社会主义”。于是，许多违反当地条件的作法就发生了。海康县南田社六百多亩撒播改插秧或点播的稻田，因水利条件不具备，有三百八十五亩田农民忍痛犁掉了。因为推广早播，廉江县的农民就不得不把还不该收获的烟叶、蕃薯收回来。据湛江专区七个县和湛江市郊区的初步统计，由于这种错误作法而减产的就有五万多亩，其中廉江县损失稻谷就有二百八十万斤。
    当然，在那些作得较好的地方，技术改革仍然是发挥了良好的作用，减产的只是盲目乱改的部分地区。
    在各县召开党代表大会时，代表们对这种盲目乱干强迫命令的作风提出了尖锐的批评。
    批评，本来是为改正错误的，并不是要把作得正确的部分也纠正掉。可惜，有些干部没有正确领会这种批评的精神，会后出现了这样的论调：“早造技术改革我们犯了主观主义、强迫命令，晚造让群众自己干好了！”“还搞什么改革？再来一次党代会可吃不消”，“多做多错，少做少错”，不少干部就这样接受了个“聪明”的教训，晚造技术改革的放任自流现象就发生了。中国有句俗话叫“因噎废食”，用这句话来比喻这种想法和作法，再恰当不过了。
    当然，这种现象还不能说已经形成风气，但从部分地区的情况看，已经足够引起警惕了。如果继续把这种“愚蠢”的想法当作“聪明”，继续放任自流下去，不在秋收前的田间管理工作上加一把劲，弥补过去的不足，那就真叫做从错误到错误，一错再错了！
