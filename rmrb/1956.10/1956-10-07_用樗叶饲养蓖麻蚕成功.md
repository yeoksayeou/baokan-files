Successful Use of Ailanthus Leaves to Feed Eri Silkworms

    According to reports from Professor Yao Wu of the Agronomy Department of Northwest Agricultural College, trials have proven the successful use of Ailanthus leaves (commonly known as Chinese Sumac leaves) as a substitute for castor leaves in feeding Indian Eri silkworms. In two feeding trials conducted in the sericulture laboratory, the growth of Eri silkworms fed with Ailanthus leaves was better than those fed with other substitute plants such as dandelions, yellow mouse grass, and mugwort. The silkworms developed robustly and uniformly, and the time for the entire larval stage and cocoon spinning was shorter, averaging only eighteen to twenty days.

    The successful solution to the problem of using Ailanthus leaves as a substitute for castor leaves in feeding Indian Eri silkworms creates favorable conditions for the widespread raising of this new silkworm in rural areas of Northwest China in the future.

    The Ailanthus tree is a common tree in the Northwest region, and it begins to sprout leaves in early April each year, more than a month earlier than castor. Therefore, using Ailanthus leaves to replace castor leaves for raising Eri silkworms not only overcomes the difficulty of feed shortages in some areas where castor is not planted, but also allows for an extra feeding cycle, increasing the production of Eri silkworm cocoons.

    The introduction of Indian Eri silkworms to China is only five or six years old, and this silkworm only began to be introduced to Shaanxi Province for trial rearing last August. Currently, many agricultural cooperatives in Wugong, Dali, Xingping and other counties in Shaanxi Province have begun to use Ailanthus leaves to feed Eri silkworms as a sideline production, and the results have been very good. Each box of silkworms yields an average of more than thirty catties of cocoons per batch.

### 用樗叶饲养蓖麻蚕成功

    用樗叶饲养蓖麻蚕成功
    据新华社讯　用樗叶（俗名臭椿叶）代替蓖麻叶来饲育印度蓖麻蚕已经试验成功。据西北农学院农学系教授姚鋈在蚕丝室两次饲育试验，以樗叶饲育的蓖麻蚕的生长情况比较用蒲公英、黄鼠草、?蒿等其他代饲植物饲育的都好，蚕儿的发育强健整齐，全龄结茧时间还短，平均只有十八天到二十天。
    用樗叶代替蓖麻叶来饲育印度蓖麻蚕这个问题的获得成功，为今后我国西北地区农村大量饲养这种新蚕创造了有利条件。
    樗树是西北地区普遍生长的一种树木，每年4月初就开始发叶，比较蓖麻发叶早一个多月，因此利用樗叶来代替蓖麻叶养育蓖麻蚕，不仅克服了某些没有种植蓖麻地区饲料的困难，同时还可以提前多喂一次蚕，使蓖麻蚕茧的生产量增加。
    印度蓖麻蚕引种到中国还只有五、六年历史，去年8月间这种蚕才开始引种到陕西省试养。目前陕西省武功、大荔、兴平等县很多农业社都开始以樗叶饲养蓖麻蚕为副业生产，结果也都很好，每盒蚕一次结茧平均都在三十斤以上。
