Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th: News from Hong Kong: Workers from all trades in Hong Kong and Kowloon have expressed extreme indignation at the riots created by Kuomintang secret agents in the Kowloon area. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions sent four representatives to meet with the head of the Hong Kong British Authorities Police Department on the afternoon of the 12th. The representatives were received by Mr. Wilkes, Director of the Political Department of the Police Department. During the meeting, the representatives presented the following four demands to the Hong Kong Police Authorities:

	1. The Hong Kong authorities should promptly take effective measures to immediately stop the riots, ensure social security and order in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and protect the safety of workers, citizens' lives and property.

	2. Immediately arrest the organizers of the riots and the secret agents participating in the riots, and severely punish them to appease public anger.

	3. Immediately rescue the workers and citizens who have been beaten and injured, and be responsible for medical treatment.

	4. Immediately consider detailed follow-up measures for trade unions, factories, shops, etc. that have been damaged.

	The representatives pointed out during the meeting that it has now been fully proven that the Kowloon riots were an extremely serious incident organized and planned by Kuomintang secret agents. The safety and security of the lives and property of workers and residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon have been severely damaged. The losses suffered by Hong Kong and Kowloon industries and businesses are also very significant.

	The representatives also pointed out that workers from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon are extremely indignant at the riots of Kuomintang secret agents, the development of the situation, and the serious losses suffered. The representatives expressed regret that the Hong Kong authorities had failed to take more rapid and effective measures to stop this serious act of violence by Kuomintang secret agents. The representatives also pointed out that some people's description of this incident as a fight between left- and right-wing workers is obviously a distortion of the facts, obscuring the truth, and covering up the crimes of Kuomintang secret agents.

	According to currently known materials, since the riots occurred, trade unions and workers' welfare institutions, including the Metal Workers' Union, Printing Workers' Union, Enamel Workers' Union, Da Zheng [Translator: I'm not sure about this one, it could refer to a type of labor] Workers' Union, Dock Workers, Woodworkers' Union, Textile Dyeing Workers' Union, Flower Workers' Union, and Motorcycle Labor Children's School, have been disrupted by rioters throwing stones and attempting arson. The Kowloon Dock Labor Union, Mong Kok Labor School, Hung Hom Labor School, the General Federation of Textile Dyeing Workers' Unions, and the Kowloon Bookstore have also been threatened by riots. The Tsuen Wan Silk Weavers' Union, the Tsuen Wan Workers' Medical Clinic, and the Tsuen Wan Service Department of Textile Dyeing have been destroyed by rioters, resulting in extremely serious losses.

    港九工会代表向香港英警务处提出四项要求
    立即制止骚乱　逮捕国民党特务分子
    新华社广州13日电　香港消息：港九各业工人对国民党特务分子在九龙地区制造的骚乱事件，表示非常愤慨。港九工会联合会在12日下午派出四名代表，往见香港英国当局警务处长，由警务处政治部主任威路科斯接见。代表们在会见时向香港警察当局提出四项要求：
    一、香港当局应迅速采取有效措施，立即制止骚乱，确保港九社会治安秩序，保障工人、市民生命财产的安全。
    二、立即逮捕策划骚乱的主持者及参加骚乱的特务分子，严厉惩处，以平民愤。
    三、对被殴打受伤的工人和市民，立即进行抢救，并负责医理。
    四、对已受破坏的工会、工厂、商店等应立即考虑详细的善后办法。
    代表们在会见中指出，现在已经完全证明，九龙骚乱事件是国民党特务分子有组织、有计划所制造的一宗极端严重的事件。港九工人、居民的生命财产安全与保障已受到严重损害。港九工商业所蒙受的损失，也非常重大。
    代表们还指出，港九各业工人对于国民党特务分子的暴乱行为及事态的发展与所受的严重损失，表示极大愤慨。代表们对香港当局未能采取更迅速有效措施来制止国民党特务分子的这种严重暴行，表示遗憾。代表们同时指出，有些人把这项事件说成什么左右派工人发生打斗，显然是歪曲事实，模糊真相，使国民党特务分子的罪行得到掩饰。
    另据目前已知材料，自骚乱发生以来，工会和工人福利事业机构已有五金工会、印务书会、搪瓷工会、打挣工会、船坞码头、做木工会、纺织染工会、花卉工会、摩托车劳工子弟学校等单位，先后受到暴徒掷石扰乱及企图放火。九龙船坞劳工联合会、旺角劳校、红磡劳学、纺织染职工会总会、九龙书会还先后受到骚乱威胁。至于荃湾丝织工会、荃湾工人医疗所、纺织染荃湾服务部，更先后为暴徒所捣毁，损失异常严重。
