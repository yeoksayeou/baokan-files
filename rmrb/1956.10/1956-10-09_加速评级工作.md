　　Accelerate Wage Grade Evaluation
　　Tian Gong
　　The wage reform has been underway for a long time. In many places, the education received during the wage reform has truly satisfied everyone, sparking a surge in learning technology and improving skills. However, some units are dragging their feet, and wage grade plans are either not being presented to the masses in a timely manner or are not being finalized for a long time after being presented.

　　The masses are very dissatisfied with the slow progress of the wage reform, saying it's "all thunder, no rain." At the same time, this wage reform is extensive, occupying a significant amount of manpower. If the delay is too long, it will inevitably affect the smooth progress of other work. Therefore, regions and departments that are slow should accelerate their work to complete this task.

　　What is hindering the rapid progress of the grade evaluation work?

　　There is a popular saying: "The problem is too complicated; it doesn't matter if it's slow. Anyway, the State Council has announced the method of retroactive payments, giving the masses peace of mind." So they sit in the office, with a few people slowly lining up and calculating, strictly guarding the "secrets," and not meeting with the masses. It should be said that this year's wage reform is the largest in scale, involving a wide range of aspects, and is extremely complex. There are varying degrees of wage increases and promotions, so it should be carefully lined up and calculated. However, many facts prove that the evaluation work of a few people is often one-sided. Only by meeting with the masses and explaining the problems encountered in the evaluation can the evaluation work be fair and reasonable. Otherwise, even if the lineup is reasonable, failure to publicize and explain to the masses will still cause suspicion and dissatisfaction, lengthening the evaluation time. Therefore, the regulations of the State Council should not become an excuse for delaying time. Being fast is not necessarily bad. Unjustified delays are actually a manifestation of a weak mass perspective.

　　Another popular saying is, "The amount of wage increase stipulated by the higher authorities is not enough to distribute; even a clever housewife cannot cook without rice." It is true that this phenomenon exists, and the higher authorities should help coordinate for units that are indeed short of funds. However, in general, the wage increase target stipulated this time is sufficient for distribution. The problem is that some units have expanded the promotion scope without principle or have upgraded too much during the evaluation. For example, in four units of the Xuchang Special Zone forestry system, sixty-two out of sixty-six people were promoted, including all cadres above the level of clerk, who were promoted by two grades, and some staff members were promoted from two grades to three grades. Some enterprise units have exceeded the scope of management personnel promotion stipulated by the State Council. Some units believe that past wages were not reasonable enough and want to take the opportunity to solve all problems at once. Some have also departed from technical standards or the actual conditions of cadres, resulting in mass dissatisfaction. As a result, "equal treatment, equal distribution of benefits," regardless of good or bad, all are promoted by one grade. The amount of wage increase stipulated by the higher authorities is naturally far from enough with this approach. Therefore, they report to the higher authorities, complaining, and when they do not receive a reply after complaining, they dare not give a positive explanation to the masses, thus delaying the time. In fact, the masses do not demand that everyone be promoted. The main thing is to be fair and reasonable: those who should be promoted should be promoted, and those who should not be promoted should not be promoted. Except for special circumstances, as long as it is explained clearly, the understanding of the masses will be obtained.

　　Wage reform is an extremely complex task. After this reform, the wage system and wage grades are more reasonable than in the past, but this is by no means completely reasonable. In fact, the new wage system itself still has many areas that need improvement. For example, the issue of enterprise classification, the wage balance between people studying industry and those studying finance, the wage difference between state organ staff and production management personnel, etc. All these issues need to be gradually resolved thoroughly. Those who graduated from the same school and started working at the same time, but due to different positions and different rates of progress, some differences are inevitable. The responsibility of our leadership is to do a good job in lining up, listen carefully to the opinions of the masses, and achieve the maximum degree of fairness and rationality; and through this evaluation, attract everyone's attention to improving work and improving technology, and educate everyone to consciously overcome the ideas of separating from collective interests and simply pursuing personal life treatment, and overcome various forms of egalitarianism. Strive to improve their ideological awareness, professional level, and technical level so that, under the principle of "to each according to his work," their wages can be continuously improved.

　　加速评级工作

    工资改革工作已经进行很久了，许多地方经过工资改革的教育，真正做到了大家满意，掀起了学习技术、提高业务的热潮，但是有的单位却拖延时日，工资等级方案迟迟不能和群众见面，见了面也久久不能定案。
    群众对于工资改革工作进行得太慢是非常不满意的，说是“只打雷，不下雨”。同时，这次工资改革工作规模很大，占用人力较多，如拖延时间过久，势必影响其他工作的顺利进行。因此，做得慢的地区和部门应该加快工作的速度做好这项工作。
    什么东西障碍着评级工作的迅速进行呢？
    有一种很流行的说法：“问题太复杂，慢点不要紧，反正国务院已经公布了补发的办法，群众有了定心丸”。于是他们坐在办公室里，由少数人慢腾腾地排队、算账，严守“秘密”，不同群众见面。应该说，今年工资改革是规模最大，牵涉面很广，内容极其复杂的一项工作，增加工资有多有少，升级面有大有小，应该很好地排队、算账。但是许多事实证明，少数人的测评工作，往往是带有片面性的，只有同群众见面，向群众讲明评级中遇到的问题，才能把评级工作作到公平合理。不然，即使排队很合理，不向群众宣传解释，同样会使群众猜疑，引起群众不满，拖长了评级的时间。因此，国务院的规定，不能成为拖延时间的借口，快了不一定就是不好。无故拖延时间，实际上是群众观点不强的表现。
    另一种流行的说法是“上级规定的增加工资额不够分配，巧妇难为无米之炊”。不错，这种现象是有的，上级对于确实不够分配的单位，应该帮助调剂。但是在一般情况下，这次规定的增加工资指标是够分配的，问题在于有些单位在评级时无原则地扩大了升级面，或者升级过多。例如许昌专区林业系统四个单位六十六人中有六十二人升级，其中科员以上干部都提升两级，办事员有的升两级到三级。有的企业单位管理人员升级超过国务院规定的幅度。有的单位过去工资不够合理，想趁机一次解决全部问题。也有的离开了技术标准或干部的实际条件，致使群众不服气，结果“平等待遇，利益均沾”，不分好次，一律递升一级。这种作法，上级规定的工资增加额自然大大不够了。于是，便向上级告急，叫苦，在叫苦以后还得不到答复的时候，又不敢对群众作正面解释，因而拖延了时间。事实上群众并不是要求人人升级的，主要是要作到公平合理，该升就升，不该升就不升，除了特殊情况之外，只要讲清楚就会取得群众的谅解。
    工资改革是一件极其复杂的工作。经过这次改革以后，工资制度和工资等级比过去合理，但这绝不是做到完全合理。事实上新工资制度本身还有不少需要改进的地方。例如企业分类问题，学工业与学财经的人员的工资平衡问题，国家机关工作人员和生产管理人员工资差额问题等等。所有这些问题都需要逐步求得彻底解决。同一个学校毕业，同时参加工作，但因岗位不同，各人进步快慢不同，总免不了有些差别。我们领导方面的责任是把排队工作作好，认真倾听群众的意见，做到最大限度的公平合理；并且通过这次评级把大家注意力吸引到改进工作，提高技术上去，教育大家自觉地克服离开集体利益、单纯追求个人生活待遇的思想，克服各种各样的平均主义思想。努力提高自己的思想觉悟、业务水平和技术水平，以便在“按劳付酬”的原则下，使自己的工资不断提高。
