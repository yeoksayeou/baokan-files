It is Wrong to Forbid the Culling of Old and Disabled Cattle
　　Zhang Yasun
　　Since the State Council issued instructions on preventing the indiscriminate slaughter of draught cattle and protecting and developing draught cattle, Party and government leading bodies in various localities have attached considerable importance to the issue of protecting draught cattle. However, in the course of implementation, some regions have regarded some old and disabled cattle that have already lost their ability to work as draught cattle, and universally forbid their culling and slaughter. For example, some regions stipulate: “Cattle must not be disposed of until they stop breathing.” “If a cow can walk three steps when whipped, it counts as a draught animal.” “Cattle that are driven over are not acceptable; only cattle brought by large carts (referring to those unable to walk) are permitted to be sold for slaughter."
　　The inspection and approval procedures for old and disabled cattle are also quite complicated, and the standards applied are extremely inconsistent. In some areas, the approval of old and disabled cattle requires the involvement of township governments, supply and marketing cooperatives, tax offices, and veterinary stations. In other areas, in addition to these steps, mass appraisal is also required. Farmers say this is a "four-court joint trial" and "passing five checkpoints." Farmers have to have their cattle inspected when selling them, purchasing units have to inspect them when transporting them, and they have to be inspected again when transferred to the sales destination. Often, cattle that are deemed by the place of origin to be old and disabled and suitable for slaughter are considered draught cattle by the place of sale and not allowed to be slaughtered, creating a dilemma.
　　The result of this excessive control is that farmers cannot sell their old and disabled cattle and cannot replace them with new draught cattle in a timely manner, forcing them to wait for the cattle to die of old age. In Kalaqin Left Banner, Liaoning Province, on a market day in early May, farmers brought 170 cattle to the market for sale, but only seven were permitted to be purchased as beef cattle. Seventeen of the remaining cattle died on the way home. Yan Miao Xu Agricultural Cooperative in Xinxiang County, Henan Province, had 40 old and disabled cattle that could not participate in production, and even the insurance company refused to insure them, but the veterinary station still refused to approve their disposal and continued to charge feed fees. In July, Rudong, Shuyang, Xinyi and other counties in Jiangsu Province had more than 600 old and weak cattle that farmers urgently needed to sell, including more than 20 that were already lying on the ground, but the inspection departments did not approve their sale. This situation caused great dissatisfaction among farmers. Some farmers said to their old cattle, "Die, you are wasting fodder alive!" Some farmers deliberately killed their old and disabled cattle and then skinned them to sell the meat, causing significant economic losses to the farmers.
　　Another consequence of excessive control is the tight supply of beef in cities. Severe shortages occurred in various provinces in the first half of this year. Due to the long-term shortage of beef in Liaoning Province, the cattle and sheep industry and the Hui Muslim catering industry in many cities in the province were forced to close down. In some areas, beef could not even be sufficiently supplied during the Hui Muslim Eid al-Fitr festival.
　　Why do many regions forbid the culling of old and disabled cattle?
　　One reason is that the slaughter standards are set too high or are not clear and specific enough. For example, the slaughter standards stipulated in most areas of Liaoning Province are two or three years higher than the standards stipulated by the province. Some regions only vaguely stipulate that "all cattle capable of working are not allowed to be slaughtered." This standard is difficult to grasp. The second reason is that, in the process of implementing the policy of protecting draught cattle, some regions have excessively criticized and punished units and cadres who violated the policy of protecting draught cattle, without analyzing which mistakes were due to lack of experience and which were due to lack of attention. This has caused many cadres doing specific work to have concerns and fear punishment, resulting in "inspectors not daring to inspect, responsible persons not daring to approve, and purchasers not daring to purchase."
　　The peak season for old and disabled cattle to enter the market is about to begin this year, and farmers and herdsmen will have a large number of old and disabled cattle to sell. Therefore, these abnormal phenomena urgently need to be resolved. I would like to offer a few suggestions for the relevant departments to consider:
　　(1) Speed up the formulation of specific and clear slaughter standards. Each province should formulate different slaughter standards and annual elimination ratios based on the different conditions of draught cattle in agricultural areas and free-range cattle in mountainous and pastoral areas, using different dental age limits as standards, combined with working ability (generally, age is directly proportional to working ability), as a measure for grasping policy.
　　(2) Designate specific personnel to be in charge of approval. If necessary, a township review panel can be established, composed of relevant local departments. Line up the old and disabled cattle that need to be eliminated, and approve them according to the slaughter standards and elimination ratios, combined with the specific local cattle raising situation. After approval by the township people's committee (or review panel), other units may no longer re-inspect, in order to simplify procedures.
　　(3) The principle of the place of sale obeying the place of origin must be implemented for slaughter standards. The place of sale shall slaughter based solely on the certificate issued by the place of origin, without being restricted by local standards; otherwise, it will affect inter-provincial and inter-city adjustments.
　　(4) Eliminating the ideological concerns of cadres is one of the keys to doing a good job in protecting draught cattle and eliminating old and disabled cattle. Therefore, it is necessary to educate cadres to resolutely correct the thinking and practices of "rather be 'left' than right."

### 不准淘汰老残牛是不对的

    不准淘汰老残牛是不对的
    张雅荪
    自从国务院发布了关于防止滥宰耕牛和保护发展耕牛的指示以后，各地党政领导机关对保护耕牛问题，都引起了相当的重视。但是在贯彻执行当中，有些地区却把一些已经丧失了耕作能力的老残牛也当作耕牛，一律不准淘汰、屠宰。如有些地区规定：“牛不断气，不准处理。”“打一鞭能走三步，算是耕牛。”“赶来的牛不行，只有大车拉来的牛（指不能走的）才准许出卖屠宰。”
    对老残牛的检验、批准手续也相当繁复，而且掌握的标准极不一致。有的地区审批老残牛要经过乡政府、供销社、税务所和兽医站等单位，有的地区除了这些步骤之外，还要经过群众评议。农民说这是“四堂会审”，“过五关”。农民卖牛要检验，收购单位外运又要检验，调到销地还要检验。往往产地认为是不能耕作的老残牛，可宰；销地却认为是耕牛，不能宰，弄得进退两难。
    这样控制的结果，使农民的老残牛卖不出去，不能及时补换耕牛，只好坐等牛老死。辽宁省喀喇沁左旗在5月上旬的一个集日，农民赶集求售的牛有一百七十头，允许收购作菜牛的，仅七头，其余的牛在归途中就死了十七头。河南新乡县阎苗许农业社有四十头不能参加生产的老残牛，连保险公司也不接受保险，但兽医站仍不批准处理，还要收保槽费。7月份江苏省如东、沭阳、新沂等县共有六百多头老弱牛，农民急待出售，其中并有二十多头已卧地不起，但检验部门不批准。这种情况引起农民十分不满，有的农民对着老牛说：“死吧，活着浪费饲料！”有的农民就故意把老残牛弄死，再扒皮卖肉，这样使农民在经济上遭受到很大的损失。
    控制过严的另一后果是使城市牛肉供应紧张。今年上半年各省普遍发生严重的脱销情况。辽宁省由于牛肉长期脱销，省内不少城市的牛羊业和回民饮食业，被迫停业，有的地区在回民开斋节时，牛肉也不能充分供应。
    为什么许多地区不准淘汰老残牛呢？
    原因之一是：屠宰标准订得过高，或者不够明确、具体。例如辽宁省大多地区规定的屠宰标准，都比省规定的标准提高了二、三岁；有些地区只笼统规定：“凡有使役能力的均不准屠宰”。这个标准很不好掌握。原因之二是：在贯彻保护耕牛政策的过程中，有的地区曾经对违反保护耕牛政策的单位和干部进行了过多的指责和惩罚，没有分析那些错误是由于缺乏经验，那些是由于不重视而造成的；这就使许多做具体工作的干部思想上产生顾虑，怕受处分，结果形成“检验员不敢检验，负责人不敢批准，收购员不敢收购”。
    今年老残牛上市的旺季即将开始，农牧民将有大量老残牛要求出售。因此，这些不正常的现象急待解决。特提出几点意见，供有关部门参考：
    （一）赶快制定具体、明确的屠宰标准。各省应根据农业区的耕牛和山区、牧区的散牛的不同情况，以不同的口齿界限为标准，结合耕作能力（一般年龄与耕作能力成正比例），明确的规定屠宰标准和每年淘汰比例，做为掌握政策的尺度。
    （二）指定专人掌握批准。必要时可成立乡评议小组，由当地有关部门组成。将需要淘汰的老残牛进行排队，根据屠宰标准和淘汰比例，结合当地具体养牛情况，予以批准。经乡人民委员会（或评议小组）批准后，其他单位可不再复验，以简化手续。
    （三）屠宰标准必须贯彻销地服从产地的原则。销地一律凭产地出具的证明宰杀，不受当地标准的限制；否则，会影响省市间的调剂。
    （四）消除干部的思想顾虑是作好保护耕牛、淘汰老残牛工作的关键之一。因此，必须教育干部切实纠正“宁‘左’勿右”的思想和作法。
