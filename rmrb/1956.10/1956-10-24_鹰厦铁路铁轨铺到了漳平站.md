Xinhua News Agency, Yingtan-Xiamen Railway Construction Site, 20th. The Yingtan-Xiamen Railway track-laying troops, amidst cheers from the local people, laid tracks to Zhangping Station on the afternoon of the 18th.

When the track-laying train advanced to the outskirts of Zhangping city, the whole city was in jubilation, with lanterns and decorations everywhere and firecrackers set off. On the afternoon of the 19th, a celebration meeting of more than 13,000 people was held at the station. A visiting group from the old revolutionary base of Yongfu District, who had traveled more than 100 li, also participated in the meeting. At the meeting, the Longyan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Longyan Administrative Office, the Zhangping County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Zhangping County People's Committee presented five banners to the railway corps and the road construction workers, respectively.

The track-laying work for this section was carried out by a track-laying team composed of young soldiers and Fujianese laborers. They tenaciously overcame various difficulties in laying tracks in the continuous mountains and steep ridges, and rapidly increased the track-laying speed from an average of two kilometers per day to more than four kilometers per day. When entering Zhangping Station on the 18th, they achieved a record of five kilometers and five hundred and twenty meters per day.

Zhangping Station on the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway is also the starting point of the Zhangping-Longyan Railway. After the opening of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, Zhangping will become a transportation hub connecting southern Fujian, northern Fujian, and western Fujian, and its economic landscape will also rapidly change.

    鹰厦铁路铁轨铺到了漳平站
    新华社鹰厦铁路工地20日电鹰潭——厦门铁路铺轨部队18日下午在当地群众夹道欢呼声中，铺轨到漳平车站。
    当铺轨列车挺进到漳平城郊时，全城一片欢腾，到处悬灯结彩，燃放鞭炮。19日下午，在车站上举行了一万三千多人的庆祝大会，从一百多里路外赶来的永福区老根据地的参观团也参加了大会。会上，中共龙岩地委会、龙岩专署和中共漳平县委会、漳平县人民委员会分别将五面锦旗献给了铁道兵施工部队和筑路民工。
    参加这段铺轨工程的是一支由青年战士和福建民工组成的铺轨队。他们顽强地克服了在丛山峻岭中铺轨的各种困难，使铺轨进度由平均日进二公里迅速提高到了日进四公里以上；18日在铺进漳平车站时，达到日进五公里五百二十公尺的纪录。
    鹰厦铁路的漳平站又是漳（平）龙（岩）铁路的起点。鹰厦铁路通车后，漳平将成为联系闽南、闽北、闽西的交通枢纽，经济面貌也将迅速改观。
