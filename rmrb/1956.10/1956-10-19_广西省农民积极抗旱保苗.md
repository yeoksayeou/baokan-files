Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, October 17th: Guangxi Province is threatened by drought, and about 25% of the late rice fields have dried up and cracked. Farmers of all ethnic groups in the province have taken active measures to vigorously fight the drought and protect the seedlings. For example, in the Rongxian Special District, an average of 523,000 people from eleven counties are mobilized daily to fight the drought. In Guixian County, many agricultural cooperatives, after using up the water on the surface, look for water underground. A total of more than 1,200 underground water sources have been discovered in the county. The masses have come up with more and more ways to fight the drought. Up to now, about 1.5 million mu of drought-stricken farmland in the province has been salvaged.

Since the drought occurred in early September, the CCP Guangxi Provincial Party Committees at all levels have issued instructions on drought relief work, and dispatched a large number of cadres to drought-stricken areas to help farmers fight the drought. During the drought relief period, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places rushed to make a large number of waterwheels, water scoops, etc. to supply the farmers. Bobai County allocated an additional 780,000 jin of unified purchase and sales grain to meet the needs of some agricultural cooperative members who consumed more grain during the drought relief period.

At present, the drought relief and seedling protection campaign is still being further developed.

    广西省农民积极抗旱保苗
    新华社南宁17日电　广西省受到干旱威胁，约有25％的晚稻田已经干涸开裂。省内各族农民已经积极行动起来，大力抗旱保苗。如容县专区十一个县平均每天出动抗旱的就有五十二万三千多人。贵县很多农业社，用完了地面上的水，就向地下找水，全县共挖出地下水源一千二百多处。群众抗旱办法已愈来愈多。到目前为止，全省已挽救出受旱的农田约一百五十万亩。
    自9月上旬旱情发生后，中共广西省各级党委就发出抗旱工作指示，并抽调大批干部深入旱情严重的地区帮助农民抗旱。在抗旱期间，各地供销合作社赶做了大量水车、戽斗等供应农民。博白县为了及时供应部分农业社社员在抗旱期中耗粮较多的需要，增拨了统销粮七十八万斤。
    目前，抗旱保苗运动还在进一步展开。
