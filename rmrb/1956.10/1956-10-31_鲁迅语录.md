    Lu Xun's Quotations
    Whenever I watch sports meets, I often think like this: the winners are certainly admirable, but those contestants who, though lagging behind, still run to the finish line, and the spectators who watch such contestants with respect and without laughter, are precisely the backbone of China's future.

    For the sake of progress, that is, development, mankind should be active, and it doesn't matter if there are some mistakes in the activity. Only the half-dead and half-alive existence is a complete mistake, because it hangs up the sign of life, but in reality leads people to a dead end.

    The fighting author should focus on "argument"; if he is a poet, then it is natural to be angry, to scold, and to laugh because the emotions are uncontrollable. But it must stop at ridicule, stop at heated scolding, and must "turn joy, anger, and cursing into brilliant writing", so that the enemy is injured or killed as a result, and the author himself has no base behavior, and the audience does not consider it obscene. This is the ability of a fighting author.

    Literature and art must have criticism; if the criticism is wrong, it must be resisted with criticism. Only in this way can literature and art and criticism advance together. If everyone's mouth is shut, thinking that the literary world is clean, the result will be the opposite.

    鲁迅语录
    我每看运动会时，常常这样想：优胜者固然可敬，但那虽然落后而仍非跑至终点不止的竞技者，和见了这样竞技者而肃然不笑的看客，乃正是中国将来的脊梁。
    人类为向上，即发展起见，应该活动，活动而有若干失错，也不要紧。惟独半死半生的苟活，是全盘失错的。因为他挂了生活的招牌，其实却引人到死路上去。
    战斗的作者应该注重于“论争”；倘在诗人，则因为情不可遏而愤怒，而笑骂，自然也无不可。但必须止于嘲笑，止于热骂，而且要“喜笑怒骂，皆成文章”，使敌人因此受伤或致死，而自己并无卑劣的行为，观者也不以为污秽，这才是战斗的作者的本领。
    文艺必须有批评；批评如果不对了，就得用批评来抗争，这才能够使文艺和批评一同前进，如果一律掩住嘴，算是文坛已经干净，那所得的结果倒是要相反的。
