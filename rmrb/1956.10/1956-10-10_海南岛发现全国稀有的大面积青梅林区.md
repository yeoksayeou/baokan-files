　　Hainan Island Discovers Large Rare Chinese Plum Forest Area

　　(By our newspaper) A large Chinese plum forest area, rare in the country, was recently discovered on the coastal plains of Nanqiao District, Lingshui County. According to a preliminary survey and statistics from the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Forestry Bureau, the forest area covers more than 22,500 mu. The average diameter of the timber reaches 20 centimeters, with the largest diameter reaching 60 to 70 centimeters, a height of more than 20 meters, and an age of over 200 years.

　　Currently, the Lingshui County forestry department has implemented a ban on mountain logging and is nurturing the forest area, in order to use it as a seed collection base in the future. The first batch of seeds collected has been transported to state-owned nurseries in various regions for trial planting.

　　The Chinese plum is a rare and valuable tree species in China. This tree is an evergreen arbor, taking about fifteen years to mature into timber. The wood is fine and tough, with a distinct yellow color and grain. It does not rot after prolonged exposure to sun and water. Its underground anti-corrosion ability is more solid and durable than iron. Therefore, it can not only be used for building bridges, ships, and houses, but also as important timber in basic industrial construction. Chinese plum is suitable for growing in coastal sandy soil, has a high seed germination rate, and grows quickly, making it suitable for building timber forests and windbreaks along the coast.

　　海南岛发现全国稀有的大面积青梅林区
    本报讯　一个全国稀有的大面积青梅林区，最近在陵水县南桥区的海滨平原上发现。据海南黎族苗族自治州林业局初步勘察统计，林区面积有二万二千五百多亩。木材直径平均达二十公分，最大的直径有六七十公分，高二十多公尺，年龄在二百年以上。
    目前陵水县林业部门已在这个林区进行封山育林工作，以便作为今后采种的基地。第一批采获的种子，已运各地国营苗圃进行试种。
    青梅是我国稀有的一种贵重树种。这种树为常绿乔木，约生长十五年成材。木质细致坚韧，有鲜明的黄色材质和材格。日晒水浸经久不腐烂。埋藏地下防腐能力比铁还要坚实耐久；因此不仅可供建造桥梁、船只和房屋用材，并且为工业基本建设中的重要用材。青梅适宜生长于沿海的砂质土壤中，种子发芽率高，生长快，适合在沿海营造用材林和防风林带。
