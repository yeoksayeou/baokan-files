Editor's Note: The Parisian newspaper "France-Soir" published a lengthy report from August 21st to 28th by its Hong Kong-based special correspondent, Lucien Bodard, following his visit to South Korea. Here is a translated excerpt from that long article. The "Korea" in the text refers to South Korea. The subheadings were added by our editors.

    The Story of Syngman Rhee

    Syngman Rhee is officially eighty-one years old, but Koreans believe he is nearly ninety. The first tragedy of Korea today is the tragedy of this old man, who is completely immersed in his own illusions and unaware that he is completely detached from reality. He makes his entire people live a life of extreme poverty, but a moment has come when Syngman Rhee's autocracy is faltering.

    That is why so many Koreans voted against him in this spring's general election, and Syngman Rhee would have been defeated if it hadn't been for police pressure and the sudden death of the opposition leader.

    When the results were announced, no one was more surprised or frightened than Syngman Rhee. He walked around the palace, moaning, "I can't trust anyone anymore." Then he thought of a friend he still had. It was an ordinary farmer, an old man like himself—the only living Korean Syngman Rhee had met from his youth after returning from fifty years of wandering abroad. Syngman Rhee had this farmer brought to him and asked him about the true situation. The old rural man cautiously replied:

    "Everything is not so good. Prices are too high. The price of rice has increased fivefold in a year. Besides, there is inflation..."

    So Syngman Rhee went to the market incognito to ask about the price of rice. Every merchant told him, "3,400 hwan." Syngman Rhee was very happy because that was exactly the official price he had set himself. His farmer friend just smiled and did not point out to Syngman Rhee that plainclothes police had already visited the market and taught each merchant how to answer.

    A prominent Korean figure—I cannot reveal his name—explained to me: "This old man has established himself as the world's most actively anti-communist figure. Thus, he has become 'indispensable' to the United States. Because the South Korean army still maintains around one million soldiers, and Syngman Rhee threatens every week to use it to attack North Korea. Therefore, the Americans 'pay' and cautiously deal with Syngman Rhee. Korea does have some use, as it possesses the world's fourth-largest army and can ignite war in Asia. But this 'price-gouging,' which has been going on for three years, is tiring the people. All of (South) Korea is just a workhouse for the poor, with a parasitic army. This feeling of fatigue is especially strong because people now know that Syngman Rhee cannot create any kind of 'Great Korea' no matter what he does, because with the easing of tensions between East and West, Syngman Rhee is gradually losing the trump cards in his hand."

    After I arrived in Korea, a confidant of Syngman Rhee outlined the situation of the South Korean government as follows:

    "South Korea has 450,000 police and secret agents. However, don't think this is a modern police state. Surrounding Syngman Rhee is more like the atmosphere of a small Italian court from the time of Stendhal (1783-1842, French novelist, translator's note), a violent and indecisive, autocratic and extremely capricious regime."

    A Press Conference

    At a press conference, Syngman Rhee was supposed to answer questions that I and other journalists had submitted in writing. The beginning of the conference was completely extraordinary.

    About fifty journalists gathered in the outer room of the palace, all Koreans except for myself. A policeman called out names, and three other policemen conducted searches: every journalist was thoroughly searched. Then the journalists lined up and walked towards the palace. Each person was given a booklet printed by the Public Information Office, containing the questions submitted in writing by the journalists; forty-three questions were numbered consecutively, but the names of the journalists who asked the questions were not noted. My question was also on it. Below each question was written Syngman Rhee's answer. This was a strange way of doing things. I was puzzled; if everything had already been resolved, what was the point of holding a press conference? In fact, President Syngman Rhee wanted to talk about his feelings towards the journalists. It seemed he was not very satisfied.

    The room for receiving the journalists was a kind of bourgeois salon. The president sat in a large green chair. His eyes were closed, and his hands were crossed. Behind him stood, solemnly, the director of the Public Information Office, Ge Hongji, and the self-important American, O. P. King, who was Syngman Rhee's ghostwriter. Facing these three, fifty journalists sat huddled on small chairs, cowering as if they were already in the dock. Smoking was prohibited. A stern lecture was given in Korean for an hour... Suddenly, Syngman Rhee angrily shouted: "There is a question of crime here, which a warrior fighting for freedom cannot forgive. This is question number twenty-six. Someone dares to ask whether the Korean people are tired of opposing communism. He should be whipped." Question number twenty-six was mine; I merely asked whether the recent elections showed that the people wanted a better life. But I was condemned as public enemy number one and more or less threatened with corporal punishment.

    I couldn't understand what was said afterwards; everyone spoke Korean. The journalists replied; Syngman Rhee seemed to have suffered a stroke and insulted Ge Hongji. Ge Hongji muttered to the side. It was chaos. Everyone looked at me.

    I learned the truth afterwards—Syngman Rhee had made a mistake; he was angry because of a mistake, because he initially thought that question number twenty-six was asked by a Korean journalist. This was truly an episode from a small court...

    Shortly before the press conference, the president read the questions and "his" answers. He was furious about question number twenty-six and asked O. P. King: "Who asked this question? Who?" King thought this answer would solve the problem: "This is one of the journalists. But he didn't ask it himself; someone higher up instructed him to do so..."

    Syngman Rhee roared: "Then someone is plotting, someone wants to use the newspaper to overthrow me!"

    Then he fiercely scolded the newspapers.

    A journalist from the opposition party dared to retort: "Mr. President, no journalist in Korea is ordered to overthrow you. People are merely criticizing your policies. No one is taking money from the communists or the Japanese..."

    Syngman Rhee shouted at Ge Hongji: "Write down this person's name, write it down!" But the journalist continued: "I can say for sure that question number twenty-six was not asked by a Korean, but by a foreigner."

    Ge Hongji interjected: "That's right."

    Syngman Rhee scolded Ge Hongji: "You fool! Couldn't you have told me beforehand? If you had told me beforehand, I would never have said that! You don't know how to do your job."

    No one was arrested the next day. I asked the editor-in-chief of a newspaper that opposed the government whether the police had given him trouble. He replied with a smile:

    "The police are very annoying, but they rarely care about profound politics. They need to solve their living problems, and they have at least two hundred ways to make money."

    In fact, this dictator lives in a small world isolated from the outside. The factions surrounding him dare not tell him the lamentable truth of Korea. This group of people around him never does anything that displeases him and only allows carefully vetted news to reach him...

    Wherever Syngman Rhee goes, people whitewash the truth. There was once an exhibition held solely to deceive him. A large number of materials and all kinds of machines were borrowed from many American institutions; the brands of the manufacturers were changed, and "Made in Korea" signs were placed everywhere, and the president celebrated greatly. However, all of Korea is in poverty.

    The Fate of War Orphans

    A child of about ten years old was lazily smoking a cigarette in the center of a dirty little street. I arrived at a shantytown, where people devastated by the war lived crowded together; on barren hills were hollow piles of dry soil, which were the dwellings of these poor people. But this child was beautiful, well-nourished, and grinning.

    He was obviously proud of his American-style long shirt, which was decorated with a colored pattern representing a map of the United States, and also the Statue of Liberty. He spoke to me naturally, telling me that he was an orphan, that his parents had disappeared in a bombing of Seoul, and that he hated life in orphanages: he had escaped from orphanages four times. He chose freedom in this way... The Korean police didn't bother him because he had a way to make a living. He used to be a newsboy, but that job was too hard; now he could get a 20% commission from every customer he led to a prostitute's house, these customers being mainly American soldiers; because of the military police, it was necessary to be careful in this line of work, as the military police would beat people with clubs; he had been beaten once. He lived with seven friends of his age in a shed, his friends were also orphans, and they did the same "profession" as him. He felt satisfied and didn't complain at all. But he said at the end of his conversation with me:

    "Sometimes I feel ashamed too. The line of work I'm in isn't very noble."

    This child is the "boss" of the orphans. There are orphans everywhere in Korea; official estimates put them at around one hundred thousand, but this estimate is not true. No one knows exactly how many there are, but it's certainly two or three times more than that number. Korea does not care about them at all, except for a juvenile detention center.

    A Korean official said to me: "A homeless child is worthless. It's a vile sinner. Why should we spend money on them?"

    These unfortunate children formed hierarchical organizations. The aristocratic class is the small pimps who introduce prostitutes. A special category is the "shoe-shining children." Most orphans are petty thieves or beggars. Some orphans have physical defects that reach an extremely pitiful state; some children are blind, some have missing legs or arms, and some are even mentally disturbed. I was told that some children even had leprosy. Healthy children all form gangs, strictly ruled by older bosses. These "leaders" are from eighteen to twenty-five years old, they are often former demobilized soldiers. Each gang has more than a dozen children and has territories, rules and regulations, and courts. ... If the rules and regulations are violated even slightly, the boss will beat them with sticks or throw them off the rocks. Many children have become disabled as a result.

    The golden age of these gangs was during the war, when American goods flooded Korea. Today, these orphans mess around in Seoul. In just a few minutes, they can dismantle a jeep into parts, and the jeep disappears from then on. This is why parking fees in Seoul parking lots are the most expensive in the world: a car costs nearly ten thousand francs per month to park, and even parking in a parking lot cannot prevent the vehicle from being dismantled.

    In Korea, orphanages are a special kind of institution. As soon as a U.S. military unit is stationed somewhere in Korea, it will open several hotels, establish a church and an orphanage around it. The "founder" of the orphanage is Korean, preferably a Christian.

    All the surplus materials of the U.S. military are sent to the orphanage, these children are worthless, but the founder can use them to demand surplus food and clothing and carry out extortion. Today, the U.S. military has almost completely left Korea, and the orphanage has either closed down or is in decline. The most astute orphanage directors have turned to large world charitable organizations—American Protestant organizations. There are fifty or so of these orphanages in Korea, and they are all semi-commercial in nature. I once asked a person who runs a charitable cause. He was obviously an upright person, but he first talked to me about the financial income and expenditure. His greatest ideal is the "adoption plan." This philanthropist said to me: "We are very satisfied with the results of financial support."

    I unexpectedly visited an orphanage under the "adoption plan." People there talked to me a lot about beautiful houses. I saw a humble "founder" who only talked about prayers, piles of garbage, and several uncared-for children with glanders playing there. They snickered when I passed by, and I knew it was the action of Seoul thieves. The so-called beautiful houses were dirty and had nothing in them. The children all slept on the floor, and no one had enough space to sleep; they only had a few religious pictures besides the rags they wore on their bodies. In this place, everything showed extortion and hypocrisy.

    This is how hundreds of thousands of Korean orphans live. The street thieves live by themselves. How many of these orphans will become normal people as adults? No one is morally responsible for them, and no one is seriously reforming them.

    Taxis, Teahouses, Barracks

    People can judge Korea by its taxis—American cars from twenty years ago made of unusually galvanized iron. Each taxi has two drivers; neither of these drivers speaks any foreign languages. The only way to explain the address is to give the driver a small piece of paper with Chinese characters written on it in advance.

    There is no mileage meter on the car; the easy way to pay is to pull a large wad of banknotes from your pocket (people have to fill their pockets with banknotes because there are too many banknotes due to inflation); the main driver takes the money, and he certainly skims off the top, but it doesn't matter much because the Korean currency—hwan—is worthless.

    But why are there always two drivers? The explanations given to me were as follows: there must be at least two people to deal with the extortion of the police who are desperately trying to make money for themselves; there must also be two people to deal with attacks by children who engage in theft, especially the more terrible gang attacks by demobilized soldiers; and the second driver is also an informant for the owner of the car, whose job is to prevent the first driver from putting all the income into his own pocket; finally, there must be two people, also because the car breaks down many times a day and you have to push the car or wrap it with rope.

    It is almost impossible to find cafes, bars, or restaurants in Seoul. But teahouses are very popular, but you only meet poor people there. There are six hundred teahouses in Seoul and one thousand five hundred in Korea.

    These teahouses have nothing in common with our elegant tea rooms; they are dark places for people to forget their sorrows, where people with no money can spend ten or so hours for the price of a cup of tea of fifty hwan (equivalent to ten francs).

    It was in such a place, in such an atmosphere, that a student complained to me:

      "I am destined to have no way out.

      "I know I have no chance, but South Korea as a whole has no way out. The population is more than twice as large as the exhausted land that doesn't even produce enough rice. South Korea has no resources, nothing to sell or export."

      "To be honest, there is no Korean economy, no Korean currency. We are only kept in a state of just not starving to death. Koreans are already extremely poor—except for tens of thousands of resourceful people. I am one of the extremely poor people, and the teahouse has gradually become my place to pass the time. But how can I and these thousands of unemployed people get out of our predicament? Do you know that half of Seoul's residents are unemployed? There is no social legislation. Syngman Rhee himself has said that he is not interested in the weak: these people cannot help build his Korea."

      "The civil servants who are in the best situation among those with no way out, but their salaries are pitifully meager (a cousin of mine who is the director of a bureau earns 15,000 hwan a month, about 3,000 francs); it is a recognized fact that civil servants live by corruption. The police, who earn even less than 1,000 francs a month, extort money from residents. The police are particularly good at finding ways to make money. Now let me talk about what the police in my village do: they hold a 'spiritual support' fundraising campaign once a week. Sometimes it is to repaint his house, sometimes because he needs a table, or a stove, or some coal. Needless to say, the village must provide him with food and drink—even prepare special meals for him when he has a particularly hard task of patrolling late at night, for example, and residents must give him money whenever the police have major family life events such as having children or getting married. But these are considered normal expenses, in addition, the police have their various 'tricks'; he threatens residents to report them for engaging in political conspiracies... Despite this messing around, the police do not become rich as a result, because his victims are too poor."

    "There are also seven million refugees. The farmers are just as poor. This is the situation in Korea: poverty everywhere."

      "The only people in Korea who don't worry are the soldiers. Soldiers don't get military pay. Whether he likes it or not, he doesn't associate with ordinary people and serves for five years. His wife and children live however they can."

    "He can't get enough to eat, but he has to abide by iron discipline. As long as there is a little bit of non-compliance, he will be beaten with a stick. During the war, officers threw grenades at sentries who dozed off. Last winter, about a hundred soldiers froze to death in the trenches. When he has no specific task, he must work for the division he belongs to to earn money for the division. He simply has no time to sleep. In short, he is a slave, but he doesn't have to worry about tomorrow. However, demobilization is a tragedy. Since they have nowhere to turn, these soldiers do illegal business and engage in theft; the 170,000 disabled soldiers are the most dangerous, and some people use them as commando teams for extortion."

    I saw the strangest factory in the world: a factory that has been manufacturing soldiers in batches since 1952. The Yongmudae Barracks, located four hundred kilometers south of Seoul, "produces" six hundred soldiers every day, while absorbing six hundred farmers as cannon fodder raw materials. In addition to the existing twenty divisions, Syngman Rhee intends to add ten more divisions.

    This is the idea of the Americans. Since there is a need for troops, the Americans are trying to produce troops in the same way as they produce cars. They need infantry composed fundamentally of Asians who can fight the communists in the same way and with the same means.

    During the three hours I spent visiting the barracks, I saw the entire process of turning a farmer into a soldier in ninety-six days, which is currently being implemented. The method is divided into two stages: first, the "person" is tamed (with 353 hours of "spirit"), and the second stage is to make the tamed person learn to use weapons (with 360 hours—“substantive part”).

    I visited the "rush running." This is an extraordinary crawling training. At one end of the field I saw four machine guns firing. People crawl under bullets. And the road is uneven: these crawling people have to cross trenches, barbed wire, cross small hills, and even cross a wall. Before arriving, you must put on your bayonet and throw grenades. I doubt how these people were not all killed, but accidents are frequent.

    It seems that "daredevil running" is even more difficult. This kind of running requires crossing sixteen obstacles set on a 700-meter course in less than seven minutes.

    This extremely complete factory is daunting.

    Americans are Looking for a Successor to Syngman Rhee

     "Americans treat their former enemies—the Japanese—better than they treat us. In fact, they look down on us because we are honest people and we have neither luxury nor entertainment here. But in our hearts, we have never recognized that we were slaves of the Japanese, and we are even more unwilling to shine shoes for the Americans."

    This is what a journalist in Seoul told me. Then, he shrugged his shoulders, showing a disappointment I saw everywhere in South Korea.

    Obviously, this resentment has surprised the Americans. Because they are actually really supporting Korea with all their strength; they have wasted more than 500 billion francs in Korea since the armistice. The Korean army of nearly one million people is paid by the Americans. But for Koreans, as for all Asians, American aid is a modern form of colonialism.

    A Korean made a formal comment to me:

      "There is colonial exploitation. There is also a colonial alms-giving, that is, a country does good to another country—but does good in its own way—colonialism. A country that helps others claims that it can judge what is good for the country being helped. As a result, it imposes its own ideas, management, and even political and military interests on the country being helped."

    Many stories are circulating about this huge apparatus of American economic assistance. The most famous of these is the story of the "activity house." This house was originally a very economical invention, the method was to use a special machine to compress a portion of lime and nine portions of silt into wall panels.

    However, after the house was built, the wall panels dissolved due to the rainy season. People used paper to cover the damaged areas in order to cover them up, but it didn't work. Finally, Koreans preferred their thatched cottages to the now-empty activity houses.

    American aid is also a source of many illegal transactions. The Americans don't take out a single U.S. dollar, but take out materials, but with a condition: any recipient—whether a country or an individual—must pay in hwan. These hwan are never used to repay the Americans (besides, what are the hwan worth?); the only use of the hwan is to constitute a means by which Korea can utilize the materials it receives. This use is very unpopular.

    Anti-American sentiment exists everywhere. But the biggest fear in South Korea is that it will be abandoned by the Americans. This is a terrifying concern. Because, obviously, Korea could collapse in a few hours. All the insults and all the extortion are not to drive the Americans away, but on the contrary, to keep them, to force them to stay.

    This country has no value and no real future. It is just a bottomless pit of dollars.

    South Korea is worried that the Americans will abandon them; the Americans are also afraid that the Koreans will abandon them and finally compromise with the other side under the auspices of the communists and restore unification; these two mentalities complement each other. South Korea is able to continue to exist precisely because these two fears are at play.

    Americans are already looking for someone to succeed Syngman Rhee, but they haven't found anyone.

    法国记者笔下的南朝鲜
    编者按：巴黎“法兰西晚报”从8月21日到28日连续刊载该报驻香港特派记者吕希恩·波达尔访问南朝鲜的长篇报道。这里是从这篇长文中摘译的一部分。文中的“朝鲜”是指的南朝鲜。插题是本报编者加的。
    李承晚的故事
    李承晚正式说来有八十一岁，但是朝鲜人相信他差不多有九十岁了。今日朝鲜的第一个悲剧就是这个老头子的悲剧，他完全沉醉在自己的幻梦里而不知道自己完全脱离了现实。他使他的全体人民过着极端残酷的贫困生活，但是这样一个时刻来到了：李承晚的专制摇摇欲坠。
    就因为这，在今年春季大选时，朝鲜人中有那么多人投票反对他，而且如果没有警察的压力和反对派领袖的暴卒，李承晚本会被击败的。
    结果公布的时候，没有一个人是比李承晚更吃惊、更惶恐的。他在宫里一边走一边呻吟说：“我再不能相信任何人了。”他于是想到他仍然有一个朋友。那是一个普通农民，像他一样是个老头子——是李承晚在国外流浪五十年后回来所遇见的唯一在世的青年时代结交的朝鲜人。李承晚叫人把这位农民找来，向他询问真情实况。那位农村老者很谨慎地回答说：
    “一切都不太好。物价太高了。米价一年来涨了五倍。此外还有通货膨胀……。”
    于是李承晚便衣私访到市场上去问米价。每个商人都告诉他说：“三千四百圜”。李承晚非常高兴，因为这正是他自己所定的官价。他的农民朋友只是笑笑，没有向李承晚指出：便衣警察已经先来过了市场，教每个商人应该怎样回答。
    一位著名的朝鲜人士——我不能说出他的姓名——向我解释：“这个老头子为自己建立了世界最积极反共的人物的地位。于是他对美国就成为‘不可缺少的’了。因为南朝鲜军队仍然保持在一百万人左右，而李承晚每星期都要扬言要把它用来进攻北朝鲜。因此美国人‘付钱’而且小心翼翼地应付李承晚。朝鲜究竟是有些作用的，因为它保有位居世界第四的陆军而且可以在亚洲燃起战火。但是这种已经搞了三年的‘抬价’使人民感到疲劳。全（南）朝鲜不过是拥有一支寄生军队的贫民习艺所。这种疲困感特别大，是因为人们现在都知道李承晚不管怎么样搞是搞不出什么‘大韩’来的，因为随着东西方之间局势的缓和，李承晚正逐渐失去他手里的王牌。”
    我到达朝鲜之后，李承晚的一个亲信向我概述南朝鲜政府的情况如下：
    “南朝鲜有四十五万警察和密探。然而你不要以为这就是一个现代的警察国家。在李承晚的周围笼罩着的毋宁说是斯汤达尔（1783—1842法国小说家，译者注）时代意大利小朝廷的气氛，这是一个凶暴而又优柔寡断、专制而又极其反复无常的政权。”
    一次记者招待会
    在一次记者招待会上，李承晚本来应当答复本记者以及其他记者书面所提的问题。招待会一开头就完全异乎寻常。
    五十来个记者聚集在皇宫的外屋里，除了本记者之外全都是朝鲜人。由一个警察叫名字，另外三个警察进行搜查：每一个记者都遭到仔细的搜查。随后记者们编好队，走向皇宫。向每人发了一本公报室印行的小册子，里面包含记者们书面提出的问题；前后用数字排列了四十三个问题，但是没有注明提问题的记者的名字。我的问题也在上面。每个问题的下面写着李承晚的答复。这是一个奇怪的办法。我感到不解，既然一切都已经解决，那么开记者招待会干什么呢。事实上，是李承晚总统希望谈谈他对记者们的感想。看来他不大满意。
    接见记者的屋子是一种资产阶级沙龙。总统坐在一张绿色大椅子上。双目紧闭，两手交叉着。在他后面庄严地站着公报处长葛弘基和神气活现的美国人奥·皮·金，金是李承晚的代笔人。面对着这三个人，五十名记者拥挤地坐在小椅子上，蜷缩着好像他们已经坐在被告的席位上一样。禁止吸烟。用朝鲜话作了一个小时的严厉训话……突然李承晚愤怒地大声说：“这里有一个犯罪的问题，这是为自由而斗争的战士决不能宽恕的。这是第二十六个问题。有人竟敢询问朝鲜人民是否对反对共产主义感到厌倦了。他应该受鞭打。”提第二十六个问题的是我，我仅仅询问最近的选举是否表明人民希望过较好的日子。但是我竟然被谴责为第一号敌人并且或多或少受到威胁要对我施加体罚。
    随后讲的什么我听不懂，大家都说朝鲜话。记者们作了答复；李承晚好像患了中风症一样并且侮辱葛弘基。葛弘基在一旁嘟囔着。这是一场混乱。大家都望着我。
    事后我才知道真相——李承晚搞错了，他发怒也是出于错误，因为他起初认为第二十六个问题是朝鲜记者提的。这真是小朝廷的一个插曲……
    在记者招待会前不久，总统宣读了问题和“他的”答复。他对第二十六个问题大怒，便问奥·皮·金：“谁提的这个问题？谁？”金以为这样答复就解决问题了：“这是其中的一位记者。但是这不是他自己提出来的，是上级的某个人指示他这样做的……”
    李承晚吼叫道：“那么有人在进行阴谋活动，有人希望利用报纸来推翻我！”
    接着他就猛烈地大骂报纸。
    反对党的一个记者却敢于反驳他说：“总统先生，在朝鲜没有一个记者受命要推翻你。人们仅仅批评你的政策。也没有人拿共产党或者日本人的钱……”。
    李承晚对葛弘基嚷道：“把这个人的名字记下来，记下来！”但是那位记者继续说：“我可以肯定说第二十六个问题不是朝鲜人提的，而是一个外国人提出来的。”
    葛弘基抢着说：“确实是这样。”
    李承晚骂葛弘基说：“笨蛋！难道你不能事先告诉我么？要是事先告诉我，我决不会这样说的！你不知道如何做你的工作。”
    第二天并没有人被捕，我询问一家反对政府的报纸的总编辑：警察是否给他找麻烦。他笑着回答我说：
      “警察是非常讨厌的，但是他们很少关心高深的政治。他们需要解决生活问题，他们至少有两百种办法来搞钱。”
    事实上这位独裁者生活在同外界隔绝的小天地中。围绕着他的派系不敢对他说出令人悲叹的朝鲜真实情况。他左右的这一群人物从来不作使他不称心的事，只让细心检查过的新闻到达他那里……
    李承晚到哪里，人们就在那里粉饰太平。曾经举行过一次完全为了欺骗他的展览会。大批材料、各式各样的机器全都是从许多美国机构借用的；制造厂的牌子换掉，到处都放上“朝鲜制造”的牌子，总统则大事庆贺一番。然而整个朝鲜都在穷困中。
    战争孤儿的命运
    一个十岁左右的小孩在一条肮脏的小街中心懒洋洋地抽纸烟。我到了一个棚户区，那里拥挤地集居着被战争摧残了的人们；在不毛的丘陵上是一个一个空心的干土堆，那就是这些穷苦人的栖身处。但是这个小孩很漂亮，营养很好，笑嘻嘻的。
    他对于他的美国式长衬衫显然感到骄傲，这件衬衣上印有代表美国地图的采色图案作为装饰，而且还有自由神像。他很自然地同我谈话，对我说他是孤儿，他的父母亲在一次轰炸汉城时失踪了，他讨厌孤儿收容所的生活：他曾四度逃出收容所。他就是以他的这种方式来选择自由……朝鲜警察不去管他，因为他有了谋生之道。从前，他是卖报的报童，但是这个工作太艰苦了；现在他可以从他引到妓女家去的每一个顾客那里拿到20％的佣金，这些顾客主要是美国士兵；因为有宪兵，干这个行当需要小心，宪兵是要用大棒打人的；他曾经一度挨打。他同七个同他年纪相当的朋友住在一所棚子里，他的这些朋友也是孤儿，同他干同样的“职业”。他感到很满意，毫不抱怨。但是他在结束同我的谈话时又说：
    “有时候我也感到可耻。我干的这个行当并不是很高尚的。”
    这个孩子是孤儿中的“把头”。朝鲜到处都是孤儿，官方估计他们有十来万人，但是这个估计是不真实的。谁也不知道究竟有多少，肯定地要比这个数字多两三倍。朝鲜除掉有一个犯罪儿童收容所而外，根本就完全不管他们。
    一位朝鲜官员对我说：“一个无家可归的儿童就不是东西。这是一种下贱的罪人。为什么要我们为他们花钱呢？”
    这些不幸的儿童组成了等级组织。贵族阶层是介绍妓女的这些小皮条客。特殊的一类是“擦皮鞋儿童”。大部分孤儿都是小偷或小乞丐。有些孤儿生理上的缺陷达到了极度可怜的境地；有些儿童是瞎子，有些断腿缺手，甚至有些精神失常。有人对我说，有些儿童还患了麻疯。健康的儿童都组成帮会，受年纪比较大的头目的严厉统治。这些“领袖”的年龄从十八岁到二十五岁不等，他们往往是前复员军人。每个帮会有十多个儿童，拥有地段、清规戒律和法庭。……稍有违犯清规戒律，头目就用大棒殴打，或者把他抛下山岩。许多儿童因而成为残废。
    这些帮会的黄金时代就是战争期间，当时在朝鲜美国货物充塞。今天，这些孤儿在汉城乱搞。只消几分钟他们就会把一辆吉普车拆成零件，这辆吉普车从此就无影无踪了。正因为如此，汉城停车场的停车费是世界上最贵的了：一辆车每月的停车费将近一万法郎，而且即使停在停车场内也还是不能阻止车辆被拆走。
    在朝鲜，孤儿院是一种特殊的机构。一个美军单位一驻扎在朝鲜某地，就会在它周围开设几个酒店、成立一个教堂和一所孤儿院。孤儿院的“创办人”是朝鲜人，最好是信奉基督教的人。
    美军的一切剩余物资都送入了孤儿院，这些孩子是不值分文的，可是创办人可以利用来要求给予剩余食品和衣服，并进行敲诈勒索。今天，美国军队几乎完全离开了朝鲜，孤儿院不是倒闭了，就是萎靡不振了。最机灵的孤儿院院长便转向大的世界慈善专门机构——美国的新教组织。这种孤儿院在朝鲜有五十来个，它们都是半商业性质的。我曾经询问过一个办慈善事业的人。他显然是一个正直的人，但是他首先同我谈了财政收支情况。他最大的理想就是“收养计划”。这位慈善家对我说：“我们对于财政支援的结果很满意。”
    我出其不意地参观了一所根据“收养计划”的孤儿院。那里的人向我大谈漂亮的房舍。我看见了一位只谈祷告的谦恭备至的“创办人”，看见成堆的垃圾，若干患鼻疽病的无人照料的儿童在那里玩。他们在我经过的时候嗤嗤发笑，我知道这是汉城小偷的动作。所谓的漂亮房舍既肮脏，又一无所有。儿童们都睡在地上，而且谁也没有足够的面积供睡眠；他们除掉在身上披点破衣裳而外，只有几张宗教画片。在这个地方，一切都表明是勒索和虚伪。
    几十万朝鲜孤儿就是这样生活的。街上的小偷靠自己生活。这些孤儿中究竟有多少人将在成人时成为正常的人呢？谁也不在道义上为他们负责任，谁也没有认真改造他们。
      出租汽车、茶馆、兵营
    人们可以通过朝鲜的出租汽车——异乎寻常用白铁皮做的二十年前的美国汽车——来判断朝鲜。每部出租汽车有司机二人；这些司机都不会讲任何外国话。唯一说明地址的办法是把预先写上中国字的小纸条交给司机。
    车上不设里程表；付钱的方便办法是从口袋掏出一大捆钞票（人们不得不把钞票塞满口袋，因为由于通货膨胀，钞票太多）；主要的司机拿钱，他当然揩油，但是这没有多大关系，因为朝鲜币——圜——是一点也不值钱的。
    但是为什么总有两个司机呢？人们给我的解释如下：必须至少有两个人才能对付那些拚命为自己搞钱的警察的勒索；也必须有两个人才能对付从事偷窃的孩子袭击，尤其是更可怕得多的复员军人的结伙袭击；而且第二个司机也是汽车所有主的内线，他的职责是防止第一个司机把全部收入放进自己的腰包；最后，必须有两个人，也因为每天发生多次的汽车抛锚的时候要推动汽车或用绳索把汽车包扎起来。
    在汉城几乎找不到咖啡馆、酒吧间或饭店。但是茶馆很盛行，不过在那里只碰到穷人。茶馆在汉城有六百个，在朝鲜有一千五百个。
    这些茶馆同我们的优雅茶室毫无共同之处，是黑洞洞的供人们忘却愁苦的地方，没有钱的人化五十圜（等于十法郎）一杯的茶钱就可以在那里消磨十来个钟头。
    就是在这样一个地方，在这样的气氛中，一个学生向我陈诉苦情：
      “我是注定无路可走的。
      “我知道我没有任何机会，但是整个南朝鲜一样没有出路。在连产米数量也不够的耗竭的土地上，人口过剩两倍之多。南朝鲜没有任何资源，没有什么东西可供销售、出口。”
      “老实说，谈不上什么朝鲜经济，谈不上什么朝鲜币。我们只是被保持在仅仅不饿死的情况下。朝鲜人已经穷苦不堪——除了几万个善于钻营的人。我是穷苦不堪的人中的一个，茶馆渐渐成了我的消磨之所。但是我和这些成千的失业者怎么能走出困境呢？你知道不知道汉城有一半居民失业？没有任何社会立法。李承晚自己就说过，他对弱者不感兴趣：这些人不能帮助建立他的朝鲜。”
      “无办法的人中处境比较最好的是公务员，但是他们的薪水也微薄得可怜（我的一个当局长的堂兄弟每月赚一万五千圜，约合三千法郎）；公务员靠贪污过日子是公认的事实。月薪甚至不到一千法郎的警察就对居民进行勒索。警察是特别会想办法捞钱的。现在来谈谈我本村的那个警察的做法：他每星期搞一次‘精神支援’募捐。有时是为了重新粉刷他的住房，有时是因为他需要一张桌子，或者一个炉子，或者需要一些煤。不用说，这个村子必须供给他饮食——甚至当他例如有深晚巡逻的特别辛苦任务时要替他准备好特别饭菜，居民每逢警察有生孩子、结婚之类的家庭生活大事，就必须给他钱。不过这些算是正常开销，此外警察还有他的种种‘花样’；他用要检举居民搞政治阴谋来威胁他们……尽管这样胡搞，警察不因此就变得有钱，因为他的受害者太贫苦了。”
    “还有七百万难民。就是农民也是一样穷困的。这就是朝鲜的处境：遍地贫困。”
      “在朝鲜唯一不发愁的是兵。当兵的是没有军饷的。不管他乐意不乐意，他不在一般人中间来往，而去服役五年。他的妻子、儿女能怎么活就怎么活下去。”
    “他是吃不饱的，可是要守铁的纪律。只要有一点不守规矩，他就得挨棍子。在战争期间，军官对打瞌睡的哨兵扔手榴弹。去年冬天，有百来个士兵在壕沟里冻僵了。当他没有具体任务时，他必须替他所属的师做工来为本师赚钱。他简直没有时间睡觉。总之，他是一个奴隶，但是他无需为明天发愁。不过复员却是一出悲剧。既然无所依归，这些士兵就做不正当生意、进行盗窃；为数有十七万人的残废士兵是最危险的，有些人利用他们作为敲诈勒索的突击队。”
    我看见了世界上最奇怪的工厂：自从1952年以来一直在成批制造出兵士的工厂。设在汉城以南四百公里的永武台兵营每天“生产”六百个士兵，同时吸收六百个农民作为炮灰原料。在已有的二十师之外，李承晚打算增添十个师。
    这样做是美国人的主意。既然需要军队，美国就像生产汽车一样来设法生产军队。他们需要能用同样的方法和手段来同共产党作战的根本上由亚洲人组成的步兵。
    我在参观兵营的三小时中看到目前实行的在九十六天内把一个农民变成兵的整个过程。办法分两个阶段：先（用三百五十三小时在“精神上”）把“人”驯服，第二个阶段是（用三百六十小时——“实质部分”）使被驯服的人学会使用武器。
    我参观了“冲锋跑步”。这是一种异乎寻常的爬行训练。在场地的一端我看见四架正在发射的机关枪。人在子弹下爬行。而且路又不平：这些爬行的人必须跨越壕沟、铁丝网，越过小丘，甚至要越过一道墙。在到达之前，必须上好刺刀，投掷手榴弹。我怀疑这些人怎么没有全被杀死，可是事故是经常发生的。
    看来“大胆跑步”更不好办。这种跑步要求在不到七分钟的时间内跨越设在七百公尺路程上的十六个障碍物。
    这种十分完备的工厂是令人生畏的。
    美国人在物色继承李承晚的人
     “美国人对待他们从前的敌人——日本人比对待我们还好。实际上，他们是轻视我们的，因为我们是老实人，我们这里既没有奢侈享受，又没有娱乐可言。但是在我们内心中我们始终未曾承认过我们是日本人的奴隶，我们更不愿意给美国人擦皮鞋。”
    这是汉城的一位记者对我说的。然后，他耸一耸肩，表现出一种我在南朝鲜各地看到的失望情绪。
    显然，这种怨恨情绪使美国人大吃一惊。因为他们实际上真是在全力支持朝鲜；他们自休战以来已在朝鲜浪费了五千多亿法郎。近一百万人的朝鲜军队是由美国人给饷的。但是对于朝鲜人说来，正如对于一切亚洲人说来，美援是殖民主义的现代方式。
    有一个朝鲜人向我发表了正式的议论：
      “有进行剥削的殖民主义。也有一种施舍的殖民主义，即一个国家对另一个国家行善——但是是按照它自己的办法行善——的殖民主义。援助别人的国家自命为可以判断什么对被援助国家有利。结果它就把自己的思想、管理、甚至政治军事利益强加于被援助的国家。”
    关于美国经济援助这一大套机构，流传着许多故事。其中最著名的是“活动房屋”的故事。这种房屋最初倒是十分经济的发明，做法是使用一种特殊机器把一份石灰和九份泥沙压成墙板。
    但是，房子造好之后，由于雨季，墙板就溶解了。人们为了掩盖损坏之处就用纸贴在墙上，但是没有效用。终于，朝鲜人宁愿要他们的茅屋而不要现在空着的活动房屋。
    美援也是许多不法交易的源泉。美国人不拿出一元美金，但是拿出物资，但是附有一个条件：任何受援者——无论是国家还是个人——必须以圜支付。这些圜绝不是用来偿还给美国人的（何况，圜值得个什么呢？）；圜的用处只是构成一种使得朝鲜得以利用所收到的物资的手段。这个用途是很不得人心的。
    反美情绪到处存在。但是南朝鲜最大的恐惧，是怕被美国人抛弃。这是一种令人恐慌的隐忧。因为，显然，朝鲜在几小时内就可能崩溃。一切的侮辱、一切的敲诈都不是为了把美国人赶走，而是相反，为了把他们挽留住，迫使他们留下来。
    这个国家却没有价值可言，没有真正的前途。它只是一个美元无底洞。
    南朝鲜担心美国人抛弃他们；美国人也害怕朝鲜人放弃他们，最后在共产党主持下同对方妥协而恢复统一；这两种心理于是相辅相成了。南朝鲜所以能够继续存在下去，正是由于这两种恐惧心理在起作用。
    美国人已经在物色一个人来继承李承晚，但是他们没有找到。
