Some Anecdotes About Pu Songling
Wang Tongzhao

I. Why did Pu Songling call himself Liuquan?

Pu Songling's courtesy name was Liuxian, which anyone who has read "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" will remember, but his alias "Liuquan," or his self-designation as "Liuquan Hermit," is not widely known. Originally, his family had lived for generations in Pujiazhuang (about seven li outside Zichuan County town in Shandong. The Zichuan County urban area is now part of Zibo City, and Pujiazhuang is in Hongshan District, Zibo City). To the east were some raised mounds, uneven and sloping. On one of these mounds was a Dragon King Temple, which overlooked the surroundings and was easy to climb for a view. Just outside the temple, in a deep ditch, was a wellspring of clear water that was always full (it was like this many years ago, but now, due to mining nearby, this wellspring no longer overflows), the same in all seasons. Many willows grew on the surrounding mounds and in the ditch, with dense shade and overlapping foliage. The dense leaves where crows hid, and the soft, trailing branches, were set off by the red walls of the temple, creating a unique charm. In addition, the clear spring was always full, making it easy to drink and wash, so whether villagers or travelers passing through this beautiful scene, they couldn't help but take a few glances and rest their legs, relaxing their minds. Pu Songling loved his hometown, especially this place with its large willow trees, temple, and clear spring, so he took "Liuquan" (Willow Spring) as his alias, even carving a seal with "Liuquan Hermit" on it to stamp on his books.

Now, more than three hundred years have passed (calculated from Pu Songling's birth year), the temple has long been dilapidated, and due to logging before Liberation, those willows are all gone, awaiting replanting. Only that wellspring still exists. Visitors to Pujiazhuang can still understand why Mr. Pu chose "Liuquan" as his alias because of this "Full Spring" (the old name).

Here is an excerpt from Pu Songling's "Record of Repairing the Dragon King Temple at Liuquan," which proves his love for this "Liuquan" location, which remained the same even in his old age (he wrote this article when he was seventy-four years old):

　　"Seven li east of Zichuan is Liuquan... The water is clear and pure, the taste sweet and fragrant, enhancing the flavor of wine and the aroma of tea... It is more than a丈 deep, the water is full and overflowing, flowing out through the brickwork, hence the locals also call it Full Spring... Outside the temple is the spring, outside the spring is the river, and outside the river are the mountains. People live together on the mountains. Sitting by the spring, the small mountains look like clusters of grandchildren lined up, round like gathered rice, square like inverted seals. Sheer cliffs open into red peaks, mixed with drooping willows and green willows, circling green and wrapping white, without any visible end. On the shady side of the river, a road runs north and south, and those who appreciate the scenery often sit and linger. In winter, the brickwork is warm. In the hot summer, travelers look for shade and seek refuge, looking for the spring and seeking refuge; they take off their sweaty hats, loosen their clothes, and lean against the willow's waist, then drink, bathe, and rest. After sitting for a while, the wind rustles, the spring gurgles, and they think it is no different from Penglai... "

II. Preservation and Dissemination of Pu Songling's Works by His Descendants

Speaking of Pu Songling's works, it is difficult to determine exactly how many kinds there are besides the well-known "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio." The list of titles and numbers engraved on the back of his tombstone, erected several years after his death, is certainly strong evidence, but can we say that there were no others? It is difficult to say, and we still need to find more evidence from all sides. Just based on the posthumous works listed on the back of the tombstone, as far as I know and have seen, only three kinds of "vernacular songs" are missing. His poetry, prose collections, and other "vernacular song" miscellanies have all been found. This must first of all be attributed to the preservation and dissemination by Pu's descendants. We know that in the past, how many "celebrities," famous writers, scholars, even those who had been high officials or had far-reaching reputations, often had their unpublished manuscripts lost, their handwriting gone, or only titles remaining without finding the articles, or even a single original letter or poem, not many years after their death. In this respect, Pu's descendants are different from other families. The Pu's literary works (without woodblock prints) that we can still see today mostly come from his descendants. Apart from the readers who loved "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" and respected Pu, if we trace their source, wouldn't they have come from his descendants? For example, half of the manuscript of the printed "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" was discovered in the northeastern countryside during Liberation, and it was brought out of Shandong by Pu's descendants.

Check the first printed edition of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" - the Qingke Pavilion edition. After the sixteenth volume, there is a postscript by Pu Songling's grandson, Pu Lide. At that time, they were only copying and circulating it among themselves, and they did not have the financial resources to print it themselves, but it can be seen how much his descendants valued and hoped to spread the works that their ancestor had worked so hard on.

There is even better evidence, that is, Pu Songling's tomb, which has not been destroyed despite the various wars over the years, and the tombstone has not been knocked down or used to pave pigsties or roads. This is not without reason. The people of Pujiazhuang—mostly Pu Songling's descendants—regardless of the distance of their "family branch," have indeed fulfilled their responsibility to protect their ancestor, whose literary reputation is widely known. In the past, apart from the occasional curious literati and tourists who came to this remote and poor village to see Mr. Pu's residence and pay their respects to his mound of earth, none of the old ruling class ever thought of the "legacy" of this "Strange Tales" author! Anyone who has been to Pujiazhuang clearly understands the whole village's love for Pu Songling's tomb and his relics.

For example, the small portrait of Pu Songling in front of the manuscript of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" that is now being reproduced, was discovered and spread, which cannot but be attributed to Pu's descendants? In the early spring of 1953, the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles organized a team, led by Comrade Tao Dun, to go to Zichuan and Pujiazhuang for the first survey related to Pu Songling (also during the winter vacation of this year, Professor Yan Weiqing of Shandong Normal University was entrusted to go to Beijing to specifically investigate various printed and copied editions of Pu's works, as well as Pu's manuscripts, in major libraries and private collectors. After half a month, they gained a lot), hoping to find some relics related to Pu Songling, but they did not expect to find this portrait handwritten by Pu in his old age. Although the comrades of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles were introduced to the village by the county and district committees, at first they were unwilling to take out the portrait. After repeated gentle consultations, they still kept it in the village after viewing it, and never took it by force. After their public discussion, this legacy was shown to "outsiders" for the first time with the old ceremony of offering incense and candles. After further negotiations, it could be photographed and circulated. Can we say that Pu's descendants are only feudal-minded? Can we say that they are "ignorant of the overall situation"? Officials and gentry in the old days often threatened and bribed, forcibly plundered, or even caused families to be killed and destroyed because they were strictly guarded. Although the country has been liberated, they still did not know the government's policy on the protection of cultural relics and respect for scholars and writers of the past. Therefore, protecting this unique portrait of their ancestors with such care shows a purpose that is indeed worthy of attention! Subsequently, the Provincial Bureau of Culture allocated funds to renovate Pu Songling's former residence and his tomb, and built a pavilion on the stele, repeatedly urging that it should not be damaged. They fully understood the intention of the government's emphasis, and naturally felt relieved, happy, and without any doubt.

    有关蒲松龄的几则琐谈
    王统照
    一、蒲松龄为什么自号柳泉？
    蒲松龄字留仙，凡读过“聊斋志异”的都可记得，只是他别号“柳泉”，或以“柳泉居士”自称，就不大为人注意了。原来他家住了若干年代的蒲家庄（在山东淄川县城外约七里。淄川县城区一带今划入淄博市，蒲家庄在淄博市洪山区），东头有一些高起的丘阜，陂陀不平，一个土阜上有座龙王庙，它居高临下，便于登眺。恰在寺外的深沟中，有一口清水常满的井泉（多年前如此，今因左近开矿之故，这面井泉已不溢满了），四时一样。左近土阜上、沟道中柳树很多，繁阴复翳。那些藏鸦的密叶，牵丝的柔条与寺院的红墙互相掩映，别有一种风致。加上清泉常满，便于饮濯，所以不论庄里的和外来的行人走到这个美丽的画景中，都禁不住看上几眼，憩憩腿，使精神松散一下。蒲松龄热爱他的家乡，尤其喜欢这个有大柳树，有寺院，又有清泉的所在，因此，他遂以“柳泉”自号，曾刻过一方“柳泉居士”的图章，印在书册上面。
    到现在三百多年过去了（按蒲松龄生年计），庙早倾圮，由于解放前的砍伐，那些杨柳都已无存，尚待补植。只有那口井泉依然存在，往蒲家庄游览的还可因此“满井”（旧名）而明了蒲先生当年为什么取“柳泉”作为别号的由来。
    这里附钞蒲松龄所作“修柳泉龙王庙记”的几段，足证他对这个“柳泉”所在的爱好，虽在老年仍然一样（他作此文时已七十四岁）。
    淄东七里有柳泉……水清以冽，味甘以芬，酿增酒旨，瀹增茗香。……深丈许，水满而溢，穿甃石，??出焉，故土人又名满井。……兰若外为泉，泉外为河，河外为山。山族而居，每坐泉上，小山簇簇作儿孙罗列，圆如米聚，方如印复。削壁开丹嶂，杂以垂杨绿柳，萦青缭白，浑无断际。河之阴，一道通南北往来，解赏者辄坐流连。冬之日，甃石为燠。溽暑，行人望阴投止，望泉投止；脱汗笠，解衣?柳腰，则饮、则浴、则憩坐。坐顷、风飂飂，泉泠泠，自谓予蓬莱不易也。……
    二、蒲氏遗著与其后代的保存和传布
    讲到蒲松龄的著作，除了大家习知的“聊斋志异”外究竟还有若干种，截至现在难下定论。根据他死后若干年立的墓碑碑阴上所刻的篇名、数目，固然是个有力的证明，但是否此外就没有了？这很难说，还得从各方面更找论证。只就碑阴所刊的他的遗著，据我所知且见过的，只有三种“俚曲”没有着落，诗、文集和其他“俚曲”杂著总算都已发现。这不能不首先归功于蒲家后人的保存和传播。我们知道从前有多少“名流”，负盛名的文人，学者，甚至曾做过高官，或声誉远闻的，往往死后没有多少年，他的未刻行的遗稿便已丧失，笔迹无存，或者徒留篇目找不到文章，有的则连一封信、一首诗的原稿也没有了。这一点，蒲家的后代是与其他人家不同的，现在我们还能见到的蒲氏遗文（未有木刻本的），其来源多是由他的子孙分别传出。除由于爱好“聊斋志异”、尊重蒲氏的读者所保存外，如果辗转找其来源，还不是出自他的后人的传留？即如已印行的“聊斋志异”的半部手稿，解放时在东北的农村发现，也是蒲氏后裔由山东带出去的。
    试查“聊斋志异”第一次刻本——青柯亭本，第十六卷后便有蒲松龄的孙子蒲立德的跋语。那时只是互相传钞，他们没有自行刻板的资力，然而却可看出他的后代对其祖先辛苦经营的著作是多么重视和希望广为传播了。
    还有更好的实证，就是蒲松龄的坟茔，虽经过这多年种种兵火，却还没有毁坏，墓碑也没扑倒或弄去垫了猪圈，铺了道路。这一点不是没有原故的。蒲家庄的人民——多是蒲松龄的后代，不管“房分”远近，对于他们这位文名洋溢的祖宗确是尽了保护之责。以前除了偶有好事的文士、游人到这个偏僻穷村中看看蒲先生的住处，凭吊凭吊他那一堆土馒头之外，旧日的统治阶级谁曾念及这位“聊斋”作者的
  “遗产”！凡是到过蒲家庄的人，无不明了全庄人对于蒲松龄的坟茔和其遗物的爱护。
    如现在影印于蒲氏手稿的“聊斋志异”前面的他的小像，能够发现，能够传布出来，这哪能不归功于蒲家的后人？1953年初春山东省文联曾组织了一个小组，以陶钝同志为首，往淄川与蒲家庄作第一次有关蒲松龄的调查（也在这年寒假期间烦托山东师范学院严薇青教授到北京去，专向各个大图书馆和私人藏书家调查关于蒲氏遗著的种种印本、钞本还有蒲氏手稿的存留。经过半月，收获很多），期望找到一些有关蒲松龄的遗物，却没料到竟然发现这幅蒲氏老年亲笔所题的画像。虽是省文联的同志们经县委、区委的介绍到庄子里，起初他们还不肯将画像取出。再三婉商，看后仍存庄内，绝不强取。经他们公议后，这才以香烛供养的旧日仪式，第一次使此遗像与“外人”相见。后又经商好，才可摄影流传。这能说蒲家后人只是封建观点吗？能说人家是“不识大体”吗？旧时代的官员、绅士对人民保存的各种文物，往往威胁利诱，强取豪夺，甚至有的人家因为保守得严密遭了杀身破家之祸的，并非罕事。虽然全国解放了，他们在乡村中还不能深知政府对文物保护的政策，和对过去的学者、文人的尊重，因之慎密保护这张唯一的他们的祖先的遗像，这种用心确是值得重视！接着省文化局拨款修整了蒲松龄的故居和他的坟茔，碑上盖了亭子，再三嘱托，不可损毁。他们完全懂得政府重视的用意，自然放心、欢喜，毫无疑惑了。
