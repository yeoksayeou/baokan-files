Ayyangar, when passing through Hong Kong on the 24th, told reporters: "The Chinese people are happy. I believe that as China industrializes, their living standards will rise to the level of advanced countries in the world. China is a great country, and you will believe this after you have seen it.

    印度国会代表团团长在香港谈访华观感
    中国人民热情地进行和平建设
    新华社25日讯　香港消息：印度共和国国会访华代表团团长、人民院议长阿·阿延加尔在24日路过香港时向报界发表谈话说：“中国人民是愉快的。我相信随着中国工业化的发展，他们的生活水平将会提高到世界先进国家的水平。中国是一个伟大的国家，你去看过以后就会相信这一点。不承认这个拥有六亿人口的、稳定的中华人民共和国，是一项不幸的错误。”
    阿延加尔还说，正在建设中的中国是一个充满着热情的国家。广大群众的热情，尤其是工人的热情，是显而易见的。人们热情地进行伟大的经济建设，他们都感到他们是自己国家的主人翁。他说，中国正在竭力节省并削减军事费用，以便有更多的资金来进行经济建设。
