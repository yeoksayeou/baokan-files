    Labor Department's Reply Regarding the Problem of Backlogged Russian Translators
    The People's Daily published an article by Huang Chun on page 7 on August 11th, titled "Is it 'Urgently Needed'?", which discussed the phenomenon of the Ministry of Labor and other departments having a backlog and wasting Russian translation talent.  The situation at the Ministry of Labor is now explained as follows.
    With the approval of the State Council, the Ministry of Labor hired three additional Soviet experts in 1956.  Because the original translation staff of our ministry was small and of poor quality, and it was difficult to undertake the translation work of six experts (the original three experts), the Ministry of Higher Education was consulted to transfer eight Russian translators in April of this year.  After these translators arrived at our ministry, the translation tasks were less than originally planned because only one of the three experts originally scheduled to come to China arrived. In addition, these translators originally studied Russian teaching, and some of them constantly expressed their desire to do Russian teaching work.  We believe that their request is reasonable, but considering that other newly hired experts may come at any time, and that a large number of Soviet teaching materials urgently need to be translated, we discussed the matter with these translators, temporarily assigning them to translate teaching materials, and at the same time consulted with the Ministry of Higher Education to replace some translators. However, consultations with the Ministry of Higher Education on replacing the translators have not yielded any results.  In view of the fact that these newly arrived translators insist on doing Russian teaching work, we have agreed to their request.

### 劳动部关于积压俄文翻译人员问题的答复

    劳动部关于积压俄文翻译人员问题的答复
    人民日报8月11日七版发表的黄纯的“是‘工作急需’吗”一文中谈到劳动部和其它部门有积压和浪费俄文翻译人才的现象。现在把劳动部的情况说明一下。
    劳动部经国务院批准在1956年增聘三位苏联专家。由于我部原有翻译人员少而且质量较差，难以担负起六位专家（原有三位专家）的翻译工作，因此，商请高等教育部于今年4月间抽调了八名俄文翻译。这些翻译到我部后，由于原计划来我国的三位专家只来了一位，因此翻译任务较原计划少，加之这些翻译原来是学俄文教学的，其中有些人即不断表示要去做俄文教学工作。我们认为，他们这一要求是有道理的，但是考虑到其他新聘专家说不定什么时候来，同时另有大量的苏联教材急需翻译，所以一面同这些翻译商量，暂作教材翻译工作，一面商请高等教育部调换一些翻译。但同高等教育部商谈调换翻译一事一直没有结果。鉴于这些新来的翻译坚持要去做俄文教学工作，我们已经同意他们的要求。
