Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 27th: The workers in Upper Silesia (i.e., Katowice Province), Poland's largest industrial center, are unanimously supporting the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party with actions. During work and rest, they are enthusiastically discussing how to improve management, improve labor organization, and improve technology in order to meet the requirements of "more, better, and more economical" called for by the Eighth Plenary Session. The "Katowice Coal Mine" has extracted eight hundred and seventy-two tons more coal in the past four days than in the previous four days. In the first twenty days of October, Poland's national daily coal production was, on average, ten thousand tons below the plan, but in the last four days, this figure has been reduced to eight hundred tons, an increase of nine thousand two hundred tons per day. The "Peace" steel plant increased its steel production by one hundred and forty tons in a single day on the 22nd.

    波兰人民用实际行动支持党的决议
    工人积极增加生产　农民踊跃交售农产品
    新华社华沙27日电　波兰最大工业中心上西里西亚（即卡托维兹省）的工人一致用行动来支持波兰统一工人党中央委员会第八次全体会议的决议。他们在工作和休息的时候都热烈地讨论如何改进管理、改进劳动组织和提高技术，以求作到八中全会号召的“又多、又好、又省”的要求。“卡托维兹煤矿”最近四天中的采煤量比前四天多了八百七十二吨。在10月份前二十天里，波兰全国每天采煤量都平均比计划少一万吨，但近四天来，这个数字已减少到八百吨，即每天提高了九千二百吨。“和平”炼钢厂在22日一天中就增产了一百四十吨钢。
    卡托维兹省的农民也以实际行动支持八中全会的决议。农民们这几天积极向国家交售农产品，使这个省在完成交售任务上已经占全国第一位。
