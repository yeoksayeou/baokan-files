    Lao Both Sides Hold Cordial Talks
    Prime Minister Phouma Returns from France to Accelerate Negotiations
    Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Paris dispatch: Lao Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma already took a plane from Paris on the 9th, via Saigon, to return home. According to reports, after returning to Vientiane, he plans to accelerate the talks currently being held in the Lao capital between the Lao Royal Government and the Pathet Lao Fighting Forces.
    Phouma said that the discussions between the two Lao sides are being conducted in an extremely harmonious atmosphere, which foreshadows a very good future. The two sides have already reached an agreement in principle in August, and what remains to be determined are the details of specific implementation.
    When talking about Laos' neutral policy, Phouma said, "We are willing to live in friendship with all neighboring countries, regardless of which camp these neighboring countries belong to."
    Phouma revealed that if the domestic political situation in Laos permits, he intends to go to New York in November to serve as the head of the Lao delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. This will be Laos' first participation in United Nations activities. Laos was approved as a member of the United Nations at the last session of the United Nations General Assembly.

    富马首相自法返国准备要加速谈判
    新华社11日讯　巴黎消息：老挝首相富马亲王已经在9日从巴黎乘飞机经西贡回国。据消息说，他回万象以后准备加速目前在老挝首都举行的老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队之间的会谈。
    富马说，老挝双方的讨论是在极其融洽的气氛中进行的，这就预兆着很好的未来。双方已经在8月间就原则达成协议，尚待确定的是具体执行的细节。
    富马在谈到老挝的中立政策时说，我们愿意同一切邻国友好共处，无论这些邻国属于那一个阵营。
    富马透露，如果老挝国内政治情况许可，他打算11月间前往纽约担任老挝出席联合国大会代表团的团长。这将是老挝第一次参加联合国的活动。老挝是在上届联合国大会被批准为联合国会员国的。
