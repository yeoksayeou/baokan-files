    Developing Diverse Sideline Occupations to Overcome Disaster
    Huai Shang Agricultural Production Cooperative Receives Commendation

    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Huai Shang Agricultural Cooperative of Fengyang County, Anhui Province, has earned more than 5,900 yuan in net income from managing sideline occupations from July to September this year. These earnings have resolved many of the living difficulties faced by the 1,365 members of the cooperative after the disaster. This cooperative was recently commended by the Bengbu Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
    The Huai Shang Agricultural Cooperative has 276 member households and is located in the flood detention area on the south bank of the Huai River in Fengyang County. In June of this year, due to continuous heavy rains, all the land was flooded, resulting in a 73% reduction in production. After deducting seeds and animal feed from the harvest, the average amount of grain distributed to each person was only 83 jin (approximately 41.5 kilograms). In particular, because of the flood diversion, autumn crops could not be planted, and there was no autumn harvest, which made the disaster even more severe.
    At this most difficult time, Sun Ruiqin, the Party Branch Secretary and Director of the Cooperative, proposed a plan for production and self-salvation that included opening up wasteland in the mountains, cutting grass, and engaging in sideline occupations. He convened meetings of the cooperative management committee, the Party and Communist Youth League branch committees, and production team leaders, as well as mobilizing the masses to discuss the plan. During the discussions, the members carefully calculated various accounts. The cooperative decided to establish a public security and defense team to help the members going to the mountains to look after their homes. In this way, the members’ and some cadres' feelings of dependence and passivity were reversed. Production team leaders, who were originally afraid of difficulties, also actively led the members to the mountains to cut grass.
    By mid-September, the 150 members who went to the mountains had cut about 200,000 jin of grass and planted 405 mu (approximately 27 hectares) of rice, mung beans, and buckwheat, which are expected to yield 33,000 jin of raw grain. The cooperative also sent people to other places to order one million jin of willow branches for basket weaving. The members at home wove more than 5,200 baskets from the existing willow branches, earning a profit of more than 2,500 yuan. They also processed and sold 500 willow forks and sticks, and after several turnovers, they not only made a profit of more than 1,600 yuan, but also had a balance of 1,200 willow forks and sticks. The cooperative also sent people to work as odd-jobbers and repair roads at tobacco factories and forest farms.
    Now, the members are living normally, no member has fled the famine, no school-age child has dropped out of school, and medical and health work is also being done well. Furthermore, due to the expansion of sideline production, this cooperative no longer needs government relief from September onwards, except for some members' housing problems that require government support.

### 发展多种副业战胜灾荒  淮上农业生产社受到表扬

    发展多种副业战胜灾荒
    淮上农业生产社受到表扬
    新华社讯　安徽凤阳县淮上农业社今年7月到9月因为经营副业，已得到纯收入五千九百多元。这些收入解决了全社一千三百六十五人灾后生活上的很多困难。这个社最近受到了中共蚌埠地委的表扬。
    淮上农业社有二百七十六户社员，地处淮河南岸凤阳县的行洪区。今年6月，由于连降暴雨，土地全部被淹，减产73％，收获的粮食除去留下的种子、饲料，平均每人只分到八十三斤。特别是由于行洪，不能种秋季作物，秋季没有收成，灾情就更为严重。
    在这最困难的时候，党支部书记、社主任孙瑞勤提出了一个进山开荒、砍草、搞副业等生产自救的计划，召开合作社管理委员会、党和团的支部会、以及生产队长等干部会，并发动群众讨论了这个计划。在讨论中，社员们算了各种细账。社里决定成立治安保卫小组，帮助上山的社员看家。这样，社员和部分社干部的依赖、消极情绪都扭转了。本来怕困难的生产队长也积极带领社员到山里砍草去了。
    一百五十个上山的社员，到9月中旬已经砍了约二十万斤草，种了四百零五亩水稻、绿豆和荞麦，预计可收回原粮三万三千斤。社里又派人到外地订购了一百万斤编筐的腊条。在家的社员，把现存的腊条编了五千二百多只筐，盈利二千五百多元；又把五百根腊杈、腊棍加工出售，经过几次周转，不但获利一千六百多元，还结存腊杈、腊棍一千二百根。社里还派人到烤烟厂、林场做杂工、修公路。
    现在，社员生活正常，没有一个社员逃荒，没有一个学龄儿童失学，医疗卫生工作也做得很好。并且由于副业生产规模的扩大，除了社员一部分住房问题需要政府支持解决外，这个社从9月起就不再需要政府救济了。
