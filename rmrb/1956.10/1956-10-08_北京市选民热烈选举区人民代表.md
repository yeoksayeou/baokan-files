Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Nearly a million voters in the six urban districts of Beijing braved the rain today to vote for district people's representatives.

As early as four or five o'clock in the morning, long queues had formed in front of the more than 370 polling stations. Among them were workers just off the night shift, staff from government offices voting collectively, and many ordinary citizens. Cheng Fengsong, an old worker with more than 40 years of service, stayed up all night to cast the first vote and arrived at the polling station very early. Wang Zhiying, a student who recently turned eighteen, wanted to go to vote with his father, but in order to cast the first vote, he arrived at the polling station before dawn. Among the crowds were also landlords who had been reformed and counter-revolutionaries who had been leniently dealt with by the government and granted political rights, all of whom were exercising their right to vote for the first time.

Today, red flags flew all over Beijing, and golden "double happiness" characters were pasted on the doors of many homes. Large red banners celebrating the general election could be seen everywhere on the streets, in shop windows, and on the roofs of tall buildings.

Qianmen Dazhalan, the most concentrated shopping area in Beijing, was particularly lively. Capitalists went to vote before they had breakfast. Mao Zhichen, the chairman of the Qianmen District Federation of Industry and Commerce, and his wife, Liu Weiying, happily voted together. After the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry, the couple worked actively and led the capitalists and their families in study. Both were nominated as candidates by the voters this time.

Hui people who believe in Islam in Nanzhong Street outside Chaoyangmen went to the mosque at four o'clock in the morning to bathe. During the morning prayer, Imam Hei Fengyi recited a passage from the Quran to celebrate this grand day. Then, they went to vote in a team.

The famous handicraft family "Grape Chang" all five members of the family, wearing new clothes, came to the polling station early in the morning. Chang Guilu, who wore the medal of the National Advanced Producer Representative Conference on his chest, cast the first vote.

Today, many leaders of the central and Beijing municipal authorities, writers, artists, and scientists voted together with the citizens of Beijing.

To enable those voters who could not go to the polling stations to vote in person to exercise their rights, the staff of the election committee sent mobile ballot boxes to hospitals, sanatoriums, and homes. The mobile ballot box arrived at the Yongding River construction site, more than 50 miles from the city. The workers used more than a dozen award flags to temporarily set up a polling station. Everyone happily voted.

    北京市选民热烈选举区人民代表
    新华社7日讯　北京市城区六个区近百万选民，今天冒雨投票，选举区人民代表。
    清晨四、五点钟，三百七十多处投票站的门前，就排了长长的人群。这里面有刚下了夜班的工人，有集体来投票的机关工作人员，还有许多市民。有四十多年工龄的老工人程风松为了投第一票，一夜都没有睡觉，很早就到了投票站的门前。学生王志英最近才满十八岁，他爸爸要和他一起去投票，但他为了争取投第一票，天还没亮就到了投票站。在人群里还有第一次获得选举权的已经改变成份的地主和已被政府宽大处理而获得政治权利的反革命分子。
    今天，北京全城红旗飘扬，许多人家的门上贴上了金色的双喜字。庆祝普选的大红标语，在街头、在商店的橱窗里、在高大建筑物的屋顶上，到处可以看到。
    北京市商店最集中的前门大栅栏，那里特别热闹，资本家们还没有吃早饭就去投票。前门区工商联主任委员毛质宸和他的妻子刘维英高兴地一齐投了票，他们夫妇俩在全行业公私合营后，积极工作，带动资本家和他们的家属学习，这次都被选民提名为候选人。
    朝阳门外南中街信仰伊斯兰教的回民们，早晨四点钟就到清真寺去沐浴。在做晨礼时，阿訇黑奉一诵了古兰经中的一段，庆祝这个隆重的日子。然后，他们结队前去投票。
    著名的手工业家庭“葡萄常”全家五口人，穿着新衣服，一清早就来到了投票站。胸前挂着全国先进生产者代表大会奖章的常桂禄，投了第一票。
    今天和北京市民们在一起投票的，还有中央和北京市机关许多负责人，文学家、艺术家、科学家们。
    为使那些不能亲自去投票站投票的选民行使职权，选举委员会的工作人员把流动票箱送到了医院、疗养院和家庭。流动票箱来到了距城区五十多里的永定河工地，工人们用十几面奖旗，临时布置了投票站。大家都高兴地投了票。
