    Donkeys Are Not All That Shouldn't Be Killed
    I think the opinion raised by Comrade Liu Heng in the article "The Disaster of Donkeys" published in the People's Daily on August 23 is still worth discussing.
    As Comrade Liu Heng stated, large mules and horses have greatly increased after agricultural cooperation, and small donkeys are considered too many. Agricultural cooperative cadres are unwilling to keep donkeys, and incidents of beating to death and injury occur constantly. This phenomenon is not only present in Jirem League, but also in other regions. Why do farmers now beat to death the livestock that used to serve them? There are many reasons. I think the main reason is that after agricultural cooperation, timely arrangements were not made according to the new situation, which affected farmers' enthusiasm for maintaining livestock. The small draft animals used by some individual farmers have had their workload reduced after collective farming in agricultural cooperatives. Thus, agricultural cooperatives feel that there are too many draft animals. Which draft animals are in excess? One part is the old, weak, and physically small livestock with extremely low farming ability; the other part is livestock that still has a certain farming ability, but because of poor physical strength, it is not suitable for the use of new agricultural implements, and agricultural cooperatives want to exchange them for stronger draft animals.
    From a national perspective, the vast majority of livestock expelled from this area are also unwanted elsewhere, and the livestock themselves have a certain regional adaptability. Many of these livestock do not meet the prescribed slaughter standards in terms of age. Therefore, this part of the livestock is abundant on the market, no one buys it, slaughter is not allowed, and prices fall. Thus, the market has seen cases of buying a cow or a donkey for three or five yuan. Selling live animals is not as valuable as selling their hides and meat, and incidents of beating to death and injuring donkeys have occurred.
    Under such circumstances, I think that all regions should make comprehensive arrangements for the existing draft animals. Livestock of different breeds and qualities should be treated differently according to supply and demand and farming ability. Those that should be raised should be raised, those that should be used should be used, and those that should be slaughtered should be slaughtered. Indiscriminate killing is wrong, but blind prohibition of killing is also unfavorable to breeding. In the past, all bulls that could not be used as breeding stock could be used for meat, but now it is rigidly stipulated that they cannot be slaughtered under the age of eight. As a result, this part of the cattle has no sales channels, causing stockpiles, while the meat department fails to complete its plans, the market meat supply is tight, and farmers are anxious to sell but cannot, leading to a continuous decline in prices, and farmers are unwilling to breed livestock anymore.
    Judging from the suggestions of the Jirem League banner and county head meeting mentioned by Comrade Liu Heng, if only calling for eating donkey meat without specifically stipulating which ones to slaughter and which ones to protect, there are shortcomings; because this will cause confusion in the implementation below. However, Comrade Liu Heng did not point out this point, but believes that eating donkey meat is a disaster for agricultural production and animal husbandry, this view is not comprehensive. Using what should be used and slaughtering what should be slaughtered can stabilize livestock prices and ensure the interests of breeders.　Ren Guangjian

### 毛驴并不都是不该杀的

    毛驴并不都是不该杀的
    8月23日人民日报刊载的“毛驴的灾难”一文，我认为刘衡同志提出的意见还值得商榷。
    如刘衡同志所述，农业合作化以后大骡大马有了很大增加，小毛驴就嫌多了，农业社干部不肯要毛驴，打死打伤的事不断发生。这种现象不单是哲里木盟有，其他地区也有。为什么农民现在要把以前为自己使役的牲畜打死呢？原因很多，我认为主要是在农业合作化以后没有及时的根据新的情况来加以安排，影响了农民保养牲畜的积极性。有些个体农民使役的体格小的耕畜，在农业社集体耕作后，这部分耕畜所能负担的活计减少了。这样农业社就感到耕畜多出来了。多的是那些耕畜呢，一部分是耕作能力极其低微的老残和体格小的牲畜；另一部分是还有一定耕作能力的牲畜，但因体力比较差，不适合新式农具使用，农业社想换回强壮的耕畜。
    从全国范围来说，这个地区排出的牲畜绝大多数也是别处不愿意要的，而且牲畜本身也有一定的地区适应性，在这部分牲畜中有不少是口岁不合规定的宰杀标准。因而这部分牲畜上市多、无人买、宰杀不能，价格下降。这样市场上就出现了三元、五元钱买条牛或买条驴的事情，卖活的不如卖皮卖肉值钱，打死打伤毛驴的事就发生了。
    在这样情况下，我认为各个地区应该对现有的耕畜作全面的安排，不同品种质量的牲畜，要根据供求情况和耕作能力分别对待，该养的养、该用的用、该杀的杀。滥杀是错误的，但盲目的禁杀，同样对繁殖是不利的。以前凡是不能做种畜的公牛都可作肉食，现在硬性规定八岁以下不准杀。结果这部分牛无销路，造成积压，而肉食部门计划完不成，市场肉食供应紧张，农民急着要卖又卖不出，以致价格不断下落，农民也不愿再繁殖牲畜。
    从刘衡同志提到的哲里木盟旗县长会议上的建议来看，如果只号召吃毛驴肉而不具体规定宰杀那些、保护那些，是有缺点的；因为这样会使下边执行起来发生混乱。但刘衡同志没指出这一点，而认为吃毛驴肉就是农业生产和畜牧业的灾难，这看法是不全面的。该用的用、该杀的杀，才能稳定牲畜价格，保证饲养繁殖者的利益。　任广建
