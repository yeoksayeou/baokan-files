Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd. Various mass organizations participating in the National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution are actively preparing to hold "Constitution Month" in November to strengthen the defense of Japan's constitution.

During "Constitution Month," rallies will be held in various locations. Around November 17th, a national rally for the protection of peace and independence will be held in Tokyo, the capital. At the rallies across the country, resolutions are expected to be passed opposing military budgets, opposing bureaucratic control of speech, safeguarding labor rights, opposing the construction and expansion of military bases, supporting the residents of Okinawa, and demanding the revision and abolition of unequal treaties.

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, with three million members, has decided to give full assistance to "Constitution Month" and to combine this movement with the struggles against the expansion of military bases in Okinawa, Sunagawa, and other places, as well as the future movement to ban nuclear weapons. Other trade union organizations have also decided to actively participate in the "Constitution Month" movement and have already begun fundraising activities.
