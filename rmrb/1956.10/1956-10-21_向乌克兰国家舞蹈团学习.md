    Learning from the Ukrainian National Dance Ensemble
    Jia Zuoguang
    The Ukrainian artists from the Dnieper and Donbas regions have given outstanding performances in the capital. The program includes the exquisite and lyrical Ukrainian folk dance "Embroidered Girls," the powerful and heroic "Hopak" dance, the humorous Russian comic dance "The Lovelorn" and the farcical dance "Meeting," the passionate Cossack dance, as well as the Soviet national dance Buryat dance "Minde Shin" (Warrior Circle Dance), and the Hutsul dance, etc. These dances all have distinctive national characteristics, profoundly expressing the people's character, thoughts, and feelings, and prominently reflecting the Ukrainian people's brave, witty, and creative spirit in building a better life, deeply moving the audience.
    From the performances, we can see the amazing skills of the actors, from the staged programs we can see the outstanding talent of the directors, and from the orchestra's performance we can hear pleasant and heartwarming melodies. The conductor, musicians, and actors coordinate their dances seamlessly, and the actors are so full of musicality and rhythm. The various national-style dance costumes designed by the artists also added luster to the dance programs.
    From the performances of the Ukrainian dancers, we can appreciate the director's strict requirements for the actors, as well as the actors' awareness of abiding by artistic creation discipline and their high level of labor enthusiasm. For example, in the Ukrainian dance "Embroidered Girls," twenty girls holding colored ropes cleverly weave patterns, not only changing various labor postures, but also using the colored ropes to express an image of a real spinning machine in motion. If one person makes a mistake, the entire dance cannot continue. They are not only synchronized in their movements, but also portray the image of the girls of the village of Reshetilovka; they also express the beautiful minds of the girls.
    From the choreography of the "Hopak," "Cossack," and "The Lovelorn" dances, we can see the director's very rich imagination and the choreographer's thorough discernment. Whether it is the selection of actors or the use of dance techniques, they appropriately express the theme of the dance. In "Hopak," the three male actors' acrobatic performances each have their own merits. The choreographer cleverly found actions that stimulate the actors' emotions, and fully utilized the actors' extremely skilled stunts in just a few minutes. Boris Mokrousov's spiral rotation stunts have reached a considerable height. Anatoly Knyazev and Mikhail Merkulov's acrobatic performances, whether it is a split-legged mid-air jump, or a handstand somersault and a suspended jump, also show their outstanding skills. Controlling the rotating motion in rapid speed requires the same accuracy and power as operating a heavy machine's gate valve; this superb skill is an extraordinary art that combines a high degree of intellectual and physical labor.
    The programs created by the outstanding artistic director Pavel Virsky have unique features that are worth learning from. He not only has outstanding achievements in artistic techniques, but also integrates with the actors in life, and thus also gains useful things from the actors. Pavel Virsky said: "As a dance choreographer, you must also understand each actor's thoughts, life, talents, habits, and hobbies, and try every means to understand each actor, even to understand each actor's breathing." This passage is of great help to us young Chinese dance choreographers. The Ukrainian National Dance Ensemble's visit and performances in our country have inspired young Chinese dance workers with greater confidence in exploring and organizing their own national dances.

    向乌克兰国家舞蹈团学习
    贾作光
    来自第聂伯河、顿巴斯的乌克兰艺术家们，在首都举行了出色的表演会。节目有精巧抒情的乌克兰民间舞“绣花姑娘”，有强悍豪壮的“哥巴克”舞，有幽默的俄罗斯诙谐舞“失恋者”和滑稽舞蹈“会见”，有热情奔放的哥萨克舞，还有苏联民族的舞蹈布略特舞“敏得申”（武士圈舞）、古楚尔人舞等。这些舞蹈都有鲜明的民族色彩，深刻地表现了人民的性格、思想情感，突出地反映了乌克兰人民勇敢、机智，缔造美好生活的精神面貌，深深地激动了观众。
    我们从表演中可以看到演员的令人惊异的技巧，从排演的节目中能看到编导的杰出才能，从乐队的演奏中可以听到悦耳畅心的曲调；指挥家、演奏家和演员的舞蹈配合得天衣无缝，演员们又是这样富有音乐感和节奏感。美术家设计的各种民族式样的舞蹈服装也给舞蹈节目增加了光彩。
    从乌克兰舞蹈家们的表演中，我们能体会到导演对演员的严格要求，以及演员们遵守艺术创作纪律的自觉性和高度的劳动热情。如乌克兰舞“绣花姑娘”中，出现了二十个手持彩绳的姑娘在巧妙地编着花样，她们不仅变化着各种劳动中的姿态，而且要用彩绳穿花般地表现出宛如一架真的纺织机在转动的形象。如果其中有一个人搞错了，整个舞蹈就不可能进行下去。她们不仅动作整齐，而且也刻画了列什基洛夫卡村少女的形象；也表现了姑娘们的美丽的心灵。
    从“哥巴克”、“哥萨克”、“失恋者”舞蹈的编排中，可以看出导演的非常丰富的想像力和编导的透彻的鉴别力。无论是演员的挑选，或者是舞蹈技巧的运用，都很适当地表现了舞蹈的主题。在“哥巴克”中，三个男演员的特技表演各有千秋。编导机灵地为演员找到了激发情绪的动作，仅仅在几分钟里充分地发挥了演员们极纯熟的绝技。波里斯·莫克罗夫的螺旋转特技达到了相当的高度。安纳托里·克年泽夫和米哈依尔·梅尔库洛夫的特技表演，无论是劈腿悬空跳起，抑是扶地翻身滚转和悬跳也都显示出他们卓越的技能。在急速中控制旋转动作，需要像操纵重机械中的闸板一样准确而有力；这种高超的技艺是一种不平凡的、高度的智力和体力劳动相结合的艺术。
    杰出的艺术指导巴维尔·维尔斯基所创作的节目更有独到之处，值得我们很好地学习。他不仅在艺术手法上有杰出的成就，而且在生活方面也和演员们打成一片，因而也从演员那里获得有益的东西。巴维尔·维尔斯基讲过：“作为一个舞蹈编导，还要了解每个演员的思想、生活、才能和习惯、嗜好等，对每个演员都要想尽一切办法去了解他，甚至对每个演员的呼吸都要了解。”这段话对我们这些中国年轻的舞蹈编导有极大的帮助。乌克兰国家舞蹈团在我国的访问演出，鼓舞了年轻的中国舞蹈工作者为发掘和整理自己的民族舞蹈的更大信心。
