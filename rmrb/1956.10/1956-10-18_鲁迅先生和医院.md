After Mr. Lu Xun's illness became serious in 1936, Soong Ching-ling, who was in the hospital recovering from an appendectomy, wrote to him, urging him to go to the hospital for treatment. She earnestly said, "Your life does not belong to you alone, but to China and the Chinese revolution!!! For the sake of China and the future of the revolution, it is necessary for you to preserve and cherish your body, because China needs you, the revolution needs you!!!" However, Mr. Lu Xun did not go to the hospital because of this. He felt that if "China needs you, the revolution needs you," then he should not lightly abandon himself. He didn't want to lie quietly in the hospital, not speaking, not moving, not reading, not thinking, not writing. He told a friend who advised him to recuperate elsewhere, "The environment is changing rapidly, and he should not travel alone, but should stay in the country to work." (Xu Guangping: About Lu Xun's Life) He also believed: "Now is such a pressing time, the task of the author is to immediately give a reaction or resistance to harmful things, to be a responsive nerve, a defensive hand and foot." (Preface to Essays of the Qie Jie Pavilion)

However, Mr. Lu Xun often went to the hospital to stay even when he wasn't sick. I remember one day in 1926, I went to see my fourth sister, but she wasn't there. I went to see Mr. Lu Xun at West Third Lane, Gongmenkou, and saw her as soon as I entered. This was because Mr. Lu Xun was hiding in the hospital, and she was accompanying the old lady and acting as a liaison with the hospital. Regarding this, Mr. Xu Shoushang wrote in his "Impressions of My Deceased Friend Lu Xun": "In D Hospital, a dilapidated storage room was where Lu Xun and more than a dozen acquaintances and I gathered. We slept on the terrazzo floor at night and ate bread and canned food during the day. … I stayed for about ten days and then moved to a sickroom. When the doctor came to examine me, I told him that I was not sick, and he laughed and left. Lu Xun was the same." This was because, after the "March 18th Massacre," Mr. Lu Xun and others were put on a blacklist and were wanted.

Mr. Lu Xun also had another situation where he stayed in the hospital without being sick: We can see from the ninth volume of Lu Xun's Diary that from May 26th to June 14th, 1920, Mr. Lu Xun had fifteen "nights in the hospital." During these days, he was still working as usual, and the diary also recorded sixteen "morning to the Ministry" or "morning at the Ministry." He went to the Tongren Hospital to stay at night for a child who was a little over one week old and was sick there. This child was named Pei and was his nephew.

    鲁迅先生和医院
    许钦文
    1936年鲁迅先生病势严重以后，宋庆龄先生割盲肠炎在医院里，扶病写信来劝他进医院治疗，恳切地说，“你的生命，并不是你个人的，而是属于中国和中国革命的！！！为着中国和革命的前途，你有保存、珍重你身体的必要，因为中国需要你，革命需要你！！！”可是鲁迅先生并不因此进医院，他觉得若果“中国需要你，革命需要你”，就更不应该自己轻易舍去。因为他不愿意在医院里静静躺倒，不言不动，不看书，不思想，不写作。他对劝他易地休养的友人说，“环境瞬息万变，他不应独自远行，还应该留在国内做工。”（许广平：关于鲁迅的生活）他又是这样认定的：“现在是多么切迫的时候，作者的任务，是在对于有害的事物，立刻给以反响或抗争，是感应的神经，是攻守的手足。”（且介亭杂文序言）
    可是鲁迅先生，却曾经常常是没有病到医院里去住的：记得1926年的一天，我去看四妹，没有会见。我转到宫门口西三条胡同去看鲁迅先生，却一进门就见到了她，因为鲁迅先生避居医院，她在陪伴老太太，并做和医院里取得联络的交通工作。关于这一节，许寿裳先生在亡友鲁迅印象记上有这样的记载：“D医院中，一间破旧什物的堆积房是我和鲁迅及其他相识者十余人聚居之所，夜晚在水门汀地面上睡觉，白天用面包和罐头食品充饥。……我住了十天光景，便移居病室，医师来诊，则告以无病，遂一笑而去。鲁迅亦然。”这是因为，“三一八惨案”以后，鲁迅先生等列入黑名单，要通缉了。
    鲁迅先生还有一种无病住医院的情况：我们读鲁迅日记第九册，可以知道，1920年从5月26日起到6月14日止，其间鲁迅先生有十五个“夜在病院”。在这些日子里，他是照常办公的，日记上也写着十六个“上午往部”或“上午在部”。他晚上要到同仁病院去住，为的是一个一周多岁的孩子病在那里。这孩子名沛，是他的侄子。
