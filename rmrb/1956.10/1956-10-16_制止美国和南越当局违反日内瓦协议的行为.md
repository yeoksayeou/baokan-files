    Stop the US and South Vietnamese Authorities from Violating the Geneva Accords
    Since the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam refused to consult with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on arrangements for a general election in accordance with the Geneva Accords, the US military infiltration in South Vietnam has intensified, and incidents violating the Geneva Accords have emerged one after another. This situation cannot but attract serious attention.
    In two letters to the International Commission on September 5 and October 9, the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army revealed that in July and August, the United States continuously shipped large quantities of military supplies to South Vietnam, including more than 1,000 tons of combat materials such as rifle and machine gun parts in one shipment on August 31. At the same time, news indicates that the United States is working hard to expand the regular and irregular forces of South Vietnam, with a total number of up to 250,000. The US authorities do not conceal this behavior that violates the Geneva Accords. The head of the US "economic aid" agency in Saigon, Mr. Barows, openly announced that of the US$500 million in "aid" given to the Ngo Dinh Diem regime in the past two years, US$320 million was used for military purposes. This is nothing less than a public mockery of the Geneva Accords, which explicitly prohibit the import of combat materials into Vietnam, and the International Commission, which supervises the implementation of these accords.
    The United States' blatant shipping of US military personnel and combat materials to South Vietnam and its stepped-up expansion of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's army are clearly aimed at supporting and encouraging the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to continue to resist the implementation of the Geneva Accords, to divide Vietnam for a long time, to turn South Vietnam into a US military base, and to facilitate its instigation of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to launch anti-peace adventurous actions. In recent months, with such support and instigation from the United States, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's behavior in undermining the Geneva Accords has become even more rampant. This clique has not only refused to negotiate with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to arrange general elections to this day, but has also continuously taken provocative military actions in the demilitarized zone near the provisional military demarcation line, attempting to undermine the stability of the ceasefire. In order to be able to carry out actions that violate the Geneva Accords in South Vietnam without restraint, the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique have also adopted many despicable means to obstruct the work of the International Commission, which is making arduous efforts to uphold the Geneva Accords in South Vietnam. Recently, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique fabricated an incident in which liaison personnel from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam working with the International Commission were beaten.
    The actions of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique prove that in order to consolidate peace in Indochina, the key issue remains the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords, the realization of general elections in Vietnam, and the restoration of Vietnam's reunification. As long as Vietnam's reunification is not realized, those who oppose peace will have the opportunity to exploit loopholes there. This not only causes the Vietnamese people to suffer the pain of national division but also constantly threatens peace in Indochina and Asia.
    The Geneva Accords are an extremely important international agreement guaranteeing peace in Indochina and Asia, and China is one of the signatory countries to the Geneva Accords. The Chinese people cannot but express the greatest concern for the implementation of this agreement. The current behavior of the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities in increasingly violating the Geneva Accords is intolerable. We firmly support the just stand of the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on this issue, demand that the South Vietnamese authorities abide by and implement all the provisions of the Geneva Accords, and demand that the United States immediately cease its actions that violate the Geneva Accords.

### 制止美国和南越当局违反日内瓦协议的行为

    制止美国和南越当局违反日内瓦协议的行为
    自从南越吴庭艳集团拒绝按照日内瓦协议同越南民主共和国协商安排普选以来，美国在南越的军事渗入日益加强，违反日内瓦协议的事件层出不穷。这种情势不能不引起人们的严重注意。
    越南人民军总司令部在9月5日和10月9日给国际委员会的两次信中揭露，在7、8月份，美国接连不断地把大批军火运到南越，其中8月31日的一次就运入了步枪和机关枪配件等作战物资一千多吨。同时，有消息说，美国正在努力扩充南越的正规军和非正规部队，其总数已达到二十五万人之多。美国当局并不掩饰它这种违反日内瓦协议的行为。美国驻西贡的“经济援助”机关负责人巴罗斯公开宣布，过去两年美国给吴庭艳政权的五亿美元“援助”中，有三亿二千万美元用在军事方面。这对明文规定禁止向越南运入作战物资的日内瓦协议和监督这些协议的执行的国际委员会来说，无异是公然的嘲弄。
    美国这样明目张胆地向南越运入美国军事人员和作战物资，加紧扩充吴庭艳集团军队，目的显然在于支持和鼓励吴庭艳集团继续采取抗拒履行日内瓦协议的态度，长期分裂越南，把南越变为美国的军事基地，并便于它指使吴庭艳集团发动反和平的冒险行动。最近数月来，在美国的这种支持和指使之下，吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议的行为是更加猖獗了。这个集团不但至今不肯同越南民主共和国进行安排普选的协商，而且连续地在临时军事分界线附近的非军事区采取挑衅性的军事行动，企图破坏停战的稳定。美国和吴庭艳集团还为了能够放手地在南越进行违反日内瓦协议的行动，采取了许多卑鄙的手段，来阻挠正在为维护日内瓦协议进行艰苦努力的国际委员会在南越的工作。最近，吴庭艳集团就曾制造出殴伤随同国际委员会工作的越南民主共和国方面的联络人员的事件。
    美国和吴庭艳集团的行动证明，要使印度支那的和平得到巩固，关键问题仍然在于彻底执行日内瓦协议，在越南实现普选，恢复越南的统一。越南的统一一天不实现，反对和平的人们就一天有机会在那里钻空子。这不但使越南人民遭受祖国被分裂的痛苦，并且使印度支那和亚洲的和平不断受到威胁。
    日内瓦协议是保证印度支那和亚洲的和平的一个极重要的国际协议，中国是日内瓦协议的签字国之一。中国人民对于这个协议的执行情况不能不表示最大的关心。目前美国和南越当局变本加历地违反日内瓦协议的行为，是不能容许的。我们坚决支持越南人民和越南民主共和国政府在这个问题上的严正立场，要求南越当局遵守和履行日内瓦协议全部条款，并且要求美国立即停止它的违反日内瓦协议的行动。
