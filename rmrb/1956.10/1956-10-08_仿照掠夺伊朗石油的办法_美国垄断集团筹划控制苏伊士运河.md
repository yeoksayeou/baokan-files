Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 5th: American newspapers reported that American monopoly groups are planning a new scheme to establish foreign control over the Suez Canal.

From the newspaper reports, it can be seen that these plans stipulate the establishment of a special "joint organization," that is, the establishment of a consortium of monopoly capital. The "New York Times" Washington dispatch said that the plan, jointly formulated by many American oil and shipping companies to establish a joint organization, stipulates that it will obtain the right to lease "certain operations of the Suez Canal, including the collection of fees." The newspaper wrote that the suggestion for the new consortium "is similar to a past suggestion, according to which a joint organization of American and British oil companies signed an agreement with Iran in 1954 to exploit Iranian oil."

The Egyptian representatives attending the Security Council meeting in New York to discuss the Suez Canal issue expressed their opposition to this plan. According to the Associated Press, Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi has pointed out that the American press’s insistence that Egypt will request American oil and shipping companies to help improve the canal is a "fabrication."

According to the "New York Times," Dr. Badawi, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority, said that the basis of the proposed plan is unacceptable. He pointed out that the Egyptian government does not intend to lease out its authority to collect tolls from ships under any circumstances.

Although Egypt has expressed such a clear attitude, White, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, still told reporters on October 4 that some U.S. officials had "informally" studied the plan to establish a joint organization, and they "believed that this proposal might help the current discussion on this issue." White mentioned that the plan to establish such a joint organization to manage the Suez Canal had been discussed as early as a year ago.

    仿照掠夺伊朗石油的办法
    美国垄断集团筹划控制苏伊士运河
    据新华社6日讯　塔斯社纽约5日讯：美国报纸报道了美国垄断集团要对苏伊士运河建立外国控制的新计划。
    从报纸的报道中可以看出，这些计划规定成立专门的“联合组织”，也就是成立垄断资本的联合。“纽约时报”华盛顿消息说，由美国许多石油公司和轮船公司联合制订的这个成立联合组织的计划规定，它将获得承租“苏伊士运河的某些业务，包括征收费用”的权利。报纸写道，关于新财团的建议“同过去有过的一个建议相似，根据那个建议，美国和英国的石油公司联合组织同伊朗在1954年签订了开采伊朗石油的协定。”
    到纽约参加安全理事会讨论苏伊士运河问题会议的埃及代表，表示反对这种计划。据美联社说，埃及外交部长法齐已经指出，美国报刊硬说埃及将要请求美国石油公司和轮船公司帮助改善运河一事是“捏造”的。
    据“纽约时报”报道，埃及苏伊士运河管理局董事会董事长巴达韦博士说，所建议的计划的基础是不能接受的。他指出，埃及政府在任何情况下都不打算把自己征收船只通行费的职权租让出去。
      虽然埃及已经表示了如此明确的态度，可是，美国国务院发言人怀特在10月4日还是向记者说，美国的某些官方人士“非正式地”研究了成立联合组织的计划，他们“认为这个主张可能有助于目前关于这个问题的讨论”。怀特提到，建立这种管理苏伊士运河的联合组织的计划早在一年前就讨论过了。
