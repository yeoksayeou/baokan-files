    Mr. Lu Xun and Folk Literature

    3. The Origin and Significance of Folk Literature

    When Mr. Lu Xun wrote "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction" in 1923, he considered mythology to be "the bud of religion." He said: "In ancient times, primitive people, seeing the changes and uncertainties of heaven, earth, and all things, and that these phenomena were beyond human power, created various explanations for them: all explanations are now called mythology. ... And they believed in and revered the gods and their deeds, singing praises of their power and adorning temples, and over time, culture and artifacts flourished. Therefore, mythology is not only the bud of religion and the origin of art, but also the source of literature."

    The origin of mythology is naturally related to religion, but the main reason is actually labor. People were dissatisfied with their existing lives and hoped to reduce their labor and increase production efficiency to improve their lives, but they could not achieve this immediately. Thus, they had to entrust these understandings and ideals to "gods," attributing everything to the will and power of "gods." This gave rise to "mythology."

    In the opening four lines of "A Concise History of Han Literature" from 1927-29, Mr. Lu Xun still advocated the religious origin theory: "In the past, among primitive people, they expressed their emotions and intentions through gestures and sounds. As sounds became more varied, they gradually formed words, and as words became harmonious, singing was born. In those early times, the common people were simple and honest, their hearts full of feelings, so they sang and called out freely. When the heavens and earth changed, they only feared and sang praises. Leaping and sighing, they surpassed their peers, were appreciated by the masses, remembered silently, and passed down orally, perhaps even to later generations. Furthermore, there were shamans whose job was to communicate with the gods, who performed songs and dances to pray for divine blessings, and their use in the population became even more widespread." At this time, Mr. Lu Xun had already noticed that literature started from oral tradition and "oral transmission," but he still focused on "fearing and singing praises when the heavens and earth changed" and "shamans, whose job was to communicate with the gods, who performed songs and dances to pray for divine blessings."

    However, after 1930, Mr. Lu Xun's views on the origin of folk literature greatly improved. Mythology is a part of folk literature, and he believed that folk literature (including mythology) originated from labor. When he translated Plekhanov's "Art and Social Life" in 1930, he already recognized that folk literature not only originated from religion, but mainly originated from labor.

    In 1934, Mr. Lu Xun clearly stated in "Random Thoughts Outside the Door": "The primary condition for the existence of literature is literacy, so there will naturally be no writers among the illiterate masses. However, there are creators. ... Humans had creation before they had writing, but unfortunately, no one recorded it, and there was no way to record it. Our ancestors, the primitive people, couldn't even speak at first. To cooperate in labor, they needed to express their opinions, and gradually developed complex sounds. For example, if everyone felt it difficult to lift a log, but couldn't think of a way to express it, and one of them shouted: 'Hang yu, hang yu,' then this is creation; everyone would admire it and apply it, which is equivalent to publication; if it were preserved with some kind of notation, then this is literature; he would naturally be the writer, also a literary figure, the 'Hang yu, hang yu' school." Mr. Lu Xun's words not only explained that the publication of folk literature was "for the sake of common labor," but also explained one of the meanings or characteristics of folk literature, which is oral creation.

    Based on the above four sources, it can be known that Mr. Lu Xun in the "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction" in 1923 and the "A Concise History of Han Literature" in 1927-29 still advocated the religious origin theory. But after he translated the Soviet Plekhanov's "Art and Social Life" in 1930 until the "Random Thoughts Outside the Door" in 1934, he advocated the labor origin theory. This is in line with the development path of Mr. Lu Xun's thought.

    鲁迅先生与民间文学
    赵景深
    三　民间文学的起源和意义
    鲁迅先生在1923年写“中国小说史略”时，认为神话是“宗教之萌芽”。他说：“昔者初民，见天地万物，变异不常，其诸现象，又出于人力所能以上，则自造众说以解释之：凡所解释，今谓之神话。……而于所叙说之神，之事，又从而信仰敬畏之，于是歌颂其威灵，致美于坛庙，久而愈进，文物遂繁。故神话不特为宗教之萌芽，美术所由起，且实为文章之渊源。”
    神话的起源，与宗教自然有关系，但主要的，实在于劳动。人们对原有的生活感到不满，希望能够减轻自己的劳动，增加生产效率，以改善自己的生活，但是又不能急切实现。这样，就不得不把这些认识和理想寄托在“神”的身上，把一切归之于“神”的意志与力量。这样，便产生了“神话”。
    鲁迅先生在1927—29年的“汉文学史纲要”开端的四行仍主张宗教起源说“在昔原始之民，其居众中，盖惟以姿态声音，自达其情意而已。声音繁变，寖成言辞，言辞谐美，乃兆歌咏。时属草昧，庶民朴淳，心志郁于内，则任情而歌呼，天地变于外，则只畏以颂祝，踊跃吟叹，时越侪辈，为众所赏，默识不忘，口耳相传，或逮后世。复有巫觋，职在通神，盛为歌舞，以祈灵贶，而赞颂之在人群，其用乃愈益广大。”这时鲁迅先生已经注意到文学从口头开始，注意到“口耳相传”，但他还是从“天地变于外，则只畏以颂祝”和“巫觋，职在通神，盛为歌舞，以祈灵贶”着眼。
    但是，1930年以后，鲁迅先生的对于民间文学起源的见解就有了很大的进步。神话是民间文学的一部分，他认为民间文学（当然包括神话在内）起源是在于劳动。他在1930年翻译蒲力汗诺夫的“艺术论”的时候，就已经认识到民间文学不仅起源于宗教，而是主要的起源于劳动了。
    到了1934年，鲁迅先生就在“门外文谈”中明白地说：“文学的存在条件首先要会写字，那末，不识字的文盲群里，当然不会有文学家的了。然而作家却有的。……人类是在未有文字之前，就有了创作的，可惜没有人记下，也没有法子记下。我们的祖先的原始人，原是连话也不会说的，为了共同劳作，必需发表意见，才渐渐的练出复杂的声音来。假如那时大家抬木头，都觉得吃力了，却想不到发表，其中有一个叫道：‘杭育杭育’，那么，这就是创作；大家也要佩服，应用的，这就等于出版；倘若用什么记号留存了下来，这就是文学；他当然就是作家，也是文学家，是‘杭育杭育派’。”鲁迅先生的这段话不但说明了民间文学的发表是“为了共同劳作”，还连带地说明了民间文学的意义或特质之一，就在于口头的创作。
    由于上引的四种资料，可以知道鲁迅先生在1923年的“中国小说史略”和1927—29年的“汉文学史纲要”，还是主张宗教起源说的。但他在1930年译了苏联蒲力汗诺夫的“艺术论”以后，直到1934年的“门外文谈”，便主张劳动起源说了。这是符合于鲁迅先生思想发展的道路的。　　　（全文未完）
