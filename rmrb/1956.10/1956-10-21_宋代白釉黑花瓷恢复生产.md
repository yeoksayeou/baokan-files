    Song Dynasty White Glaze Black Floral Porcelain Production Resumes

    (Reported by this newspaper) Song Dynasty white glaze black floral porcelain, possessing high artistic value, has begun to be restored to production. This type of porcelain was widely popular in the northern Central Plains region along the Yellow River during the Song Dynasty. For many years, apart from extremely crude black floral traces that have lost their original appearance on bowls and plates used by farmers, it had almost disappeared.

    This year, the Fengfeng City Ceramics Research Institute in Hebei Province, commissioned by the Art Service Department, trial-produced a batch of products, with painted patterns still maintaining the characteristics and style of Song porcelain. The Fengfeng City Daily-Use Porcelain Factory plans to add an art porcelain workshop starting next year, specializing in the production of this type of porcelain, which will add a fresh and vigorous flower to ceramic crafts in the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" campaign.

    宋代白釉黑花瓷恢复生产
    本报讯　具有高度艺术价值的宋代白釉黑花瓷器已经开始恢复生产。这是普遍流行于宋代北方中原地区黄河两岸的一种瓷器，多年来除了在农民使用的碗盘上尚能见到极粗糙、并且已经失掉本来面目的黑花痕迹外，几乎已经湮没。
    今年，河北省峰峰市陶瓷研究所接受美术服务部的委托，试制出一批产品，绘画纹样仍然保持宋瓷的特点和风格。峰峰市日用瓷厂计划从明年开始增设美术瓷车间，专事生产这类瓷器，将为陶瓷工艺品在“百花齐放”中增添一枝清香矫健的花朵。　　　　（金逢孙）
