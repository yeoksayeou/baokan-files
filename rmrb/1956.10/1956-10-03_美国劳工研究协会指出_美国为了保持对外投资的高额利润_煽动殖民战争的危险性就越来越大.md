Xinhua News Agency, New York, 26th TASS dispatch: When analyzing the U.S. Department of Commerce's research report on U.S. foreign investment, the American Labor Research Association pointed out the speed of U.S. monopoly capital's economic expansion abroad and its activities in seizing new sources of raw materials in underdeveloped countries around the world.

The association said that the Department of Commerce's figures show that these private and government capital combined already approached $45 billion in 1955, an increase of three times the total in 1939. Direct foreign investment by American companies has reached $19 billion. Profits from direct corporate investment account for 84% of all foreign investment profits, and these investments are accelerating in 1956.

The association pointed out that in 1955, the total profits from U.S. foreign investment reached an unprecedented high, totaling $3.38 billion. U.S. foreign investment profits have increased fivefold from 1940 to the present and are now growing at a rate of about 15% per year.

The Labor Research Association's analysis specifically mentioned the increasing penetration of U.S. capital into colonies. It pointed out that U.S. foreign investment has squeezed the investment of the original European colonial countries into an unimportant position. The current trend is to involve Americans in all the conspiracies carried out by corporate vested interest groups to suppress the worldwide movement for modern living standards. The U.S. government has already intervened to stop this movement in Guatemala and Iran, and now threatens to carry out this type of intervention against Egypt. The danger of corporate vested interest groups inciting decadent colonial wars to defend their 50% to 100% profit margins is also increasing.

    美国劳工研究协会指出
    美国为了保持对外投资的高额利润
    煽动殖民战争的危险性就越来越大
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社纽约26日讯：美国劳工研究协会在分析美国商务部关于美国对外投资的研究报告的时候，指出了美国垄断资本在国外进行经济扩张的速度和它在世界上不发达国家中夺取新的原料来源的活动。
    协会说，商务部的数字说明，这些私人的和政府的资本合在一起，在1955年已经接近四百五十亿美元，比1939年的总数增加三倍。美国公司的直接对外投资已经达到一百九十亿美元。公司直接投资所得到的利润占全部对外投资利润的84％，这些投资在1956年正在加速增加。
    协会指出，1955年美国对外投资的利润总数达到了空前的高额，总计为三十三亿八千万美元。美国对外投资的利润从1940年到现在已经增加了五倍，现在正以每年大约15％的速度不断增长。
    劳工研究协会的分析特别提到美国资本对殖民地日益加紧的渗入。它指出：美国的对外投资已经把原来的欧洲殖民国家的投资排挤到不重要的地位。现在的趋势是要把美国人卷进公司既得利益集团为了镇压全世界范围的争取现代生活水平的运动而进行的一切阴谋中。美国政府已经插手制止了危地马拉和伊朗的这种运动，现在扬言要对埃及进行这种干涉。公司既得利益集团为了保卫它们50％到百分之百的利润率而煽起腐朽的殖民战争的危险性也就愈大。
