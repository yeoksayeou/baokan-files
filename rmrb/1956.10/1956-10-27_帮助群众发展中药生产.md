    Help the Masses Develop Traditional Chinese Medicine Production
    Currently, the source of Chinese medicinal materials is lacking, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. Beijing Tongrentang Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop often has to stop production of dozens of prepared medicines due to insufficient supply of medicinal materials. The situation is the same in other regions. Among the out-of-stock medicines, many are commonly used medicinal materials. A reader from Changchun, Shi Mao, wrote: Rehmannia glutinosa, which has a significant effect on treating diseases such as blood-cooling, has been out of stock for a long time, so patients have to be hospitalized for treatment, which costs more and the efficacy is not as good as traditional Chinese medicine. At present, the vast majority of urban and rural residents prefer to use traditional Chinese medicine for treatment; those who could not afford medical treatment in the past now have the means to see a doctor and take medicine; traditional Chinese medicines that were not exported in the past are now being exported one after another. This shows that striving to restore and develop the production of traditional Chinese medicine has become an urgent demand of the masses.
    China's agricultural production has developed rapidly in recent years, which is certainly a good phenomenon. However, the leading organs in some medicinal material producing areas, because of one-sidedly emphasizing the increase in grain and cotton crops, have relatively neglected and reduced the production of medicinal materials. For example, in areas such as Xinchang and Shengxian in Zhejiang Province, which are rich in Atractylodes macrocephala, reducing medicinal fields was once taken as an important measure to increase grain production. In the Wuzhi and Wenxian areas of Henan Province, which are famous Rehmannia glutinosa producing areas, the local leading organs, in order to complete the grain and cotton production plans, decided not to supply grain to farmers who grow medicinal materials, which greatly reduced the planting area of ​​domestically grown medicinal materials. As for wild medicinal materials, after agricultural cooperativization, because agricultural labor can get more remuneration than collecting herbs, ordinary farmers are unwilling to take risks to go to the mountains to collect herbs.
    The leading relationship of the medicinal material purchasing departments has changed several times, and many grassroots units purchasing medicinal materials have experienced many chaotic phenomena in the process of handover and explanation, which is also a factor affecting the production of medicinal materials. Yuntai Mountain in the eastern part of Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, originally grew more than 300 kinds of medicinal materials, many of which are precious medicinal materials urgently needed in the market, but the local medicinal material company only purchases 17 kinds of medicinal materials, and the price is surprisingly low, which seriously dampens the enthusiasm of the masses for planting and collecting medicinal materials.
    At the same time, in recent years, due to the large-scale reclamation of wasteland and the destruction of field ridges, many naturally growing "herbs" have gradually decreased or even disappeared. Certain pests, diseases, and poisonous insects are also indispensable raw materials in traditional Chinese medicine. For example, silkworm chrysalis and centipedes are harmful to humans and animals. Since the launch of the health campaign, these things have been largely eliminated. The work of closing mountains for afforestation and maintaining soil and water will inevitably affect the production and collection of certain traditional Chinese medicines.
    The national professional conferences on traditional Chinese medicinal materials held in recent months have made relatively proper arrangements for the production, purchase and sale of medicinal materials. The pressing issue now is to take active measures to help the masses develop the production of traditional Chinese medicine. According to the spirit of the meeting, the Yunnan Provincial Department of Health, together with various relevant departments, has made a production plan for more than 340 kinds of medicinal materials, and designated some land in counties such as Wenshan, Lijiang, and Simao to specially cultivate medicinal materials, and also plans to build some new deer farms and musk deer farms to expand the production of velvet antler and musk. The medicinal material conference in Sichuan Province comprehensively studied the production and management of medicinal materials, and stipulated that agricultural cooperatives and other production units in major medicinal material producing areas should include medicinal material production in their production plans, help farmers solve various difficulties, strengthen technical guidance, and develop medicinal material production. These are all necessary measures. In the future, all regions should pay close attention to protecting wild medicinal materials and prevent them from being over-exploited. When reclaiming wasteland, thinning forests, and cutting grass for fertilizer in rural areas, certain wild medicinal materials should be transplanted and protected in a planned way.
    In order to help the masses develop the production of medicinal materials, there should be a special organization responsible for leadership, and various relevant departments should cooperate and coordinate with each other. For example, closing mountains for afforestation is necessary, but in order to take care of medicinal material production, the forestry department should stipulate methods for mining and hunting medicinal materials in the mountains. Farmers need scientific and technical guidance for planting medicinal materials, and agricultural scientific research departments should take on this task. Farmers need various material assistance for planting medicinal materials, and supply and marketing cooperatives should try to supply fertilizers, seeds, pesticides and grain needed for planting medicinal materials. Farmers need a certain amount of labor time for planting, digging, and hunting medicinal materials, and agricultural production cooperatives should make proper arrangements and determine appropriate labor remuneration. The medicinal material purchasing department can take the initiative to collect or purchase pests and poisonous insects from the masses during the health campaign, and can even consider setting up special breeding places for pests and poisonous insects.
    The level of the purchase price of medicinal materials directly affects the mood of farmers in producing medicinal materials. At present, the purchase prices of many medicinal materials are too low. For example, the original purchase price of Rehmannia glutinosa produced in Henan was only 0.25 yuan per jin, and the farmers' income was not enough to cover the production cost. Although adjustments have been made recently, the profit from planting Rehmannia glutinosa is still not as much as that from planting general crops. The purchase prices of other medicinal materials such as chrysanthemum, Angelica dahurica, and Eupolyphaga sinensis are also still too low. In order to maintain and encourage the production of medicinal materials, the purchase prices of medicinal materials should be further appropriately adjusted according to the principles of farmers' profitability and high quality and high price. The procedures for purchasing medicinal materials should also be improved, regardless of whether they are large or small, best-selling or slow-selling, whole batches or sporadic, all should be purchased. This is also an important measure to promote the production of medicinal materials and should be given attention.
    Recently, at the medicinal material conference held in Tianjin by 27 provinces and cities across the country, the supply problems of lacking or out-of-stock medicinal materials in various places were basically solved through mutual regulation. This is a good way to solve the current supply-demand imbalance of medicinal materials. Medicinal material supply departments in various places should actively support this work of mutual exchange and help the masses develop the production of traditional Chinese medicine in all aspects.

### 帮助群众发展中药生产

    帮助群众发展中药生产
    目前中药的药材来源缺乏，情况日益严重。北京同仁堂国药铺，由于药材供应不足，几十种成药经常停止生产。其他地区情况也是相同的。脱销的药品中，很多是常用的药材。长春市读者施懋来信说：治凉血等病症有明显疗效的生地黄已长期脱销，因此患者只得住医院治疗，花费又多，疗效反而不如中药。而目前绝大多数城乡居民都愿意用中药治病；过去没有钱买药治病的，现在已有力量看病吃药了；过去不出口的中药，现在也已经陆续出口了。这就说明，努力恢复和发展中药的生产，已经成为群众的一个迫切要求。
    我国的农业生产近几年来有了迅速的发展，这当然是好现象。但是，某些药材产区的领导机关，因为片面地强调粮棉作物的增产，却相对地忽视和缩减了药材的生产。如浙江新昌、嵊县等盛产白术的地区，就曾把缩减药田作为增产粮食的一项重要措施。河南武陟、温县一带是有名的生地产区，当地的领导机关为了完成粮棉生产计划，对于种植药材的农民竟然决定不供应粮食给他们，以致大大缩减了家种药材的种植面积。至于野生药材在农业合作化以后，也因为农业劳动比采药可以得到更多的报酬，所以一般农民都不愿意冒着艰险上山采药了。
    药材收购部门的领导关系经过了几度变换，很多基层收购药材的单位在移交和交代的过程中，发生许多混乱现象，也是影响药材生产的一个因素。江苏省徐州东部的云台山原来生长三百多种药材，其中许多都是目前市场亟需的珍贵药材，而当地药材公司只收购十七种药材，而且价格低得惊人，这就严重地打击了群众种植和采集药材的积极性。
    同时，近年来由于大量荒原被开垦，田埂被平毁，使许多天然生长的“草药”逐渐减少甚至绝迹。某些害虫、病虫和毒虫也是中药中不可缺少的原料。例如，僵蚕、蜈蚣都是危害人畜的，自从卫生运动开展以后，这些东西被大量消灭。封山育林、保持水土的工作，也必然会影响某些中药材的生产和采集。
    近几个月先后召开的全国中药材专业会议，对药材的生产和购销工作，作了比较妥善的安排。现在迫切的问题是要采取积极的措施，帮助群众发展中药的生产。云南省卫生厅根据会议的精神，会同各个有关部门，作出了三百四十多种药材的生产计划，并在文山、丽江、思茅等县划出部分土地，专门栽培药材，还准备新建一些养鹿场和獐子场，扩大鹿茸和麝香的生产。四川省的药材会议全面研究了药材的生产和经营问题，规定主要药材产区的农业社和其他生产单位要把药材生产列入生产规划，帮助农民群众解决各种困难，加强技术指导，发展药材生产。这些都是必要的措施。今后各个地区应当十分注意保护野生药材，防止挖光、打光。在农村开垦荒地、疏伐林木、割草积肥的时候，对某些野生药材，要有计划地加以移植和保护。
    为了帮助群众发展药材生产，应该有专门机构负责领导，并且各个有关部门之间应该互相配合和协同动作。例如，封山育林是必须作的，但是，为了照顾药材生产，林业部门应该规定到山中采掘和猎取药材的办法。农民种药需要科学技术的指导，农业科学研究部门就应该把这个任务担负起来。农民种药需要各种物质援助，供销社就应该设法供应种植药材所需要的肥料、种籽、农药和粮食。农民种植、采挖、猎取药材需要一定的劳动时间，农业生产合作社就要加以妥善的安排，并且要确定适当的劳动报酬。药材收购部门在卫生运动中，可以主动地向群众收集或购买害虫和毒虫，甚至可以考虑专门设立害虫、毒虫的养殖场所。
    药材收购价格的高低，直接影响着农民生产药材的情绪。目前，不少药材的收购价格偏低。像河南生产的生地，每斤原收购价仅二角五分，农民所得不够生产成本；最近虽然作了调整，但种植生地的利润仍然不如种植一般的农作物所得的多。其他如菊花、白芷、全虫等的收购价也还偏低。为了维持和鼓励药材生产，应该根据农民有利可得和优质优价的原则，进一步适当地调整药材收购价格。收购药材的手续也要改进，不论是大宗的，小宗的，畅销的、滞销的，整批的、零星的，都应该收购。这也是促进药材生产的一个重要措施，应该加以重视。
    最近，全国二十七个省、市在天津举行的药材会议上，经过相互调剂，基本上解决了各地缺少或脱销药材的供应问题。这是解决目前药材供不应求的好办法，各地药材供应部门应该对这种互通有无的工作积极加以支持，从各方面帮助群众发展中药的生产。
