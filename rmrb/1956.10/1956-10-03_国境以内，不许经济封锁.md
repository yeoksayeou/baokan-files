    No Economic Blockades Within National Borders
    Editor's Note: The following three letters reflect the fact that some staff members of state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives have an insufficient understanding of the new situation in which the socialist transformation has been basically completed. As a result, they still adopt overly rigid and strict management methods for the primary market. They restrict purchasing personnel from cooperative shops and small vendors from going to the countryside to conduct business; they even restrict farmers from other areas from buying piglets in their local areas and illegally withhold funds for buying pigs.
    In the political report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Eighth National Congress, it was pointed out that "Since the socialist transformation of private commerce has been basically completed, a unified socialist market has been formed," and "Many measures regarding purchasing and sales relationships adopted during the period of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist enterprises must now be changed."
    It is hoped that commercial staff in these areas will conscientiously study the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Party and earnestly examine and improve their work.
    Strange Prohibition
    The Tanghe County Food Company in Henan Province has a strange prohibition: farmers in the county are not allowed to sell piglets to other counties. To maintain this prohibition, a reward system has been established: if the masses catch people from other counties buying piglets, they will be given a reward of 30 cents per pig. However, the county food company does not buy piglets, only pigs weighing over 100 jin. As a result, many piglets on the market in each town in Tanghe County cannot be sold, and the masses are very dissatisfied. As far as I know, on July 25th, two members of an agricultural production cooperative in Sui County, Hubei Province, went to Wangji in Tanghe County to buy piglets. Two cadres from the Dahetun District Food Business Office in Tanghe County immediately found them and said sternly, "You are stealing our piglets, and they should be confiscated." Cooperative member Lao Hu hurriedly took out a letter of introduction and, in his haste, also took out his money. The two cadres glanced at the letter and said:
  “We'll give you back the letter of introduction, but leave the money. Higher authorities have ordered that piglets are not allowed to leave the county." Cooperative member Lao Li hurriedly said, "If you don't let us buy them, why keep the money?" They said, "To prevent you from buying them again!" Lao Hu and Lao Li pleaded, "If you keep the money, we will starve!" The two cadres said smugly, "As long as you don't buy piglets, we don't care if you starve!" After their repeated pleading and the persuasion of others, the two cadres finally agreed to return half of the ninety yuan for buying the pigs, and the other half would be returned after they brought a letter of introduction from Sui County.

    The Plight of Cooperative Shops
    Eggs have been out of stock in Lanzhou for a long time. To meet the needs of the citizens, the City Chicken, Duck, and Salted Egg Cooperative Shop sent people to various places to purchase eggs, but they were obstructed everywhere, and the purchase work could not be carried out. The following are just a few examples:
    When the cooperative shop sent people to Tongwei County, Gansu Province, to purchase eggs, the county food company told the cooperative shop to go to Yigangchuan to purchase, but they only collected very few eggs. After inquiring, they learned that the county food company had already signed a contract with the local agricultural cooperative to purchase eggs.
    The cooperative shop sent another purchasing agent to Gangu Anyuan Town to purchase, but the comrades at the local food purchasing station did not allow them to purchase. The purchasing agent asked, "Why?" The comrade was furious and pointed at the purchasing agent's nose, saying, "If you dare to purchase, we will sanction you with the law!"
    The cooperative shop sent people to Gulang County, Gansu Province, and the county food company introduced them to Dajing District for purchase. Before they even set off, the food company signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative, asking the supply and marketing cooperative to purchase eggs in Dajing District. Needless to say, the cooperative shop made another wasted trip.
    The cooperative shop sent people to the more distant Zhongwei, Zhongning, and Wuzhong. This time, they even brought a letter of introduction from the provincial food company. The county companies had no excuse and dared not openly prohibit the purchase, but they all unanimously introduced the purchasing agents to the places farthest from the county seat, where very few eggs were produced. This plan was indeed clever. Even if the purchasing agents purchased a few eggs, it was not easy to transport them due to inconvenient transportation. Hiring a car for transportation would be a loss, so they had to sell the eggs locally. They spent travel expenses and wasted manpower in vain, and returned to Lanzhou empty-handed.
    Jingning County adopted another method. They told the cooperative shop to purchase on a large scale, but with one condition: the company would not take a penny or send a single person. The eggs purchased by the cooperative shop would be divided equally.
    Who does this kind of threat, restriction on purchases, and equal division benefit? The result is: merchants have low confidence in operating, employees face difficulties in life, and Lanzhou has a long-term shortage of eggs. More importantly, the sales of agricultural and sideline products are sluggish, and there is no profit to be made... Ru Yun
    Why Can't They Go to the Countryside?
    Some rural supply and marketing cooperative personnel in Fujian Province oppose urban small vendors going to the countryside to sell goods, believing that this will disrupt the supply and marketing cooperative's purchase and sales plans and affect the arrangement of rural small vendors. Therefore, they take crude measures to prohibit small vendors from engaging in activities in the countryside. The Fengzhou District Cooperative in Nan'an County mobilized cooperative cadres and township cadres to patrol everywhere, detaining small vendors from Quanzhou City when they were discovered and fining them 30 yuan for land rent. The Jindeng Township and Gaokeng Village Cooperative Sales Offices in Jinjiang County sent people to block the road, not allowing small vendors from Quanzhou City to pass through the main road, forcing them to carry goods around mountain roads. Some cooperatives in Minhou County adopted direct intervention, while others had the tax bureau levy a 10% temporary commercial tax to prevent small vendors from Fuzhou City from going to the countryside. In short, there are many tricks, but the goal is only one - to close the door.
    In fact, relying solely on the supply and marketing cooperatives and small vendors in the countryside cannot meet the needs of farmers. Although the rural commercial network has been adjusted, it is still insufficient. Jinjiang Prefecture in Fujian Province is a region with a better-adjusted commercial network. On average, there is only one retail outlet for every 300 to 500 households in coastal rural areas, with only one or two commercial personnel, and the maximum number of product types is 125, while the minimum is only 30 to 50, which obviously cannot meet the diverse needs of the masses. As for the inland areas, there are even fewer retail outlets, and it is even more inconvenient for the masses to buy goods. However, the situation is different in urban areas. In Fuzhou, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and Quanzhou, there is an average of one commercial household for every 40 households, and 3.84 commercial personnel for every 100 people. Quanzhou City originally had hundreds of fish vendors who used to rely on carrying loads to the countryside for supply. Other cities also have some small vendors who specialize in going to the countryside for business, but now they cannot go to the countryside, and their lives are very difficult. Facts tell us that the result of regional economic blockade is: the material needs of farmers are not met, and the lives of urban small vendors are difficult. This approach is not beneficial to anyone.
    The first autumn harvest season after rural cooperativization is approaching, and the urban and rural markets will show an unprecedentedly active situation. We should resolutely abolish all petty rules and regulations, give full play to the inherent positive role of urban small vendors, and allow them to freely roam the countryside and bring industrial products to every corner of the countryside.

### 国境以内，不许经济封锁

专栏：读者来信

    国境以内，不许经济封锁
    编者按：下面发表的三封来信，反映了有些国营商业和供销合作社的工作人员，对于社会主义改造已经基本完成的新形势认识不足，因而对初级市场仍然采取了管理过死和管理过严的做法。他们限制合作商店的采购人员和小商贩下乡经营业务；甚至限制外地农民到本地购买小猪、并非法扣留买猪的款项。
    在中国共产党中央委员会向第八次全国代表大会的政治报告中已经指出：“由于私营商业的社会主义改造已经在基本上完成，统一的社会主义的市场已经形成”，“在利用、限制、改造资本主义企业时期所采取的许多关于购销关系的措施，现在必须改变”。
    希望这些地区的商业工作人员，认真学习党的第八次全国代表大会的文件，切实检查并改进自己的工作。
    奇怪的禁令
    河南唐河县食品公司有一个奇怪的禁令：不许本县农民出售小猪给外县。为了维护这个禁令，并且规定了一项奖励办法：如果群众抓住外县人买走的小猪，每头猪发给奖金三角钱。但是，县食品公司并不收小猪，只收购百斤以上的大猪。结果唐河县每个集镇上市的小猪多卖不出去，群众十分不满。据我知道，7月25日，有湖北省随县农业生产合作社的两个社员到唐河县王集买小猪，唐河县大河屯区食品营业所的两个干部马上找到他们，厉声说道：“你们偷购我们的小猪，应该没收。”社员老胡急忙掏出介绍信，由于着急，连钱也一块掏出来了。这两个干部略看了一下信就说：
  “介绍信给你们，钱留下。上级有命令，不让小猪出境。”社员老李忙说：“不让我们买就算了，把钱留下干嘛？”他们说：“免得你们再买呀！”老胡老李哀求说：“你把钱留下，我们不得挨饿呀！”两个干部得意地说：“只要你们不买小猪，我们不管你们饿不饿！”经过他们一再哀求和旁人的劝说，最后这两个干部才答应将九十元买猪钱归还一半；留下的一半等他们回随县拿来介绍信再取回。　张志远
    合作商店的遭遇
    兰州市鸡蛋久已脱销，为了供应市民的需要，市鸡鸭咸蛋合作商店派人到各地去收购鸡蛋，但处处都遭到阻碍，收购工作没法进行。下面不过是其中的几件事例：
    当合作商店派人去甘肃通渭县收购鸡蛋的时候，县食品公司叫合作商店的人去义岗川收购，结果只收了很少几个蛋。一打问，才知道县食品公司早和当地农业合作社订过收购鸡蛋合同了。
    合作商店又派了一个采购员到甘谷安远镇去收购，当地食品收购站的同志不让收。采购员问：“为什么？”这位同志竟怒火冲天，指着采购员鼻子说：“你如果敢收购，我们就用法律制裁你！”
    合作商店又派人到甘肃古浪县去，县食品公司介绍他们去大靖区收购。人还没出发，食品公司又和供销合作社订合同，要供销社去大靖区收购鸡蛋。不用说，合作商店又是白跑一趟。
    合作商店再派人到更远的中卫、中宁、吴忠去，这次还特别拿了省食品公司的介绍信。各县公司没词可借，不敢公开禁止收购，却不约而同把采购员都介绍到离县城最远，产蛋很少的地方。此计果然妙，采购员纵然收购了少许蛋，但因交通不便，运送不易，雇车运反而蚀本，只有把蛋就地售了。他们白白花了旅费，浪费了人力，空手回了兰州。
    静宁县采取的是另一种方法，他们叫合作商店大肆收购，但有一个条件：公司不拿一分钱，不出一个人，合作商店收下的蛋，“二一添作五”平分。
    这种威胁、限购、平分等手段，究竟对谁有好处呢？结果是：商贩经营信心低落，从业人员造成生活困难，兰州市长期鸡蛋脱销。更重要的是农副产品销售不畅，无利可图……。　汝云
    为什么不能下乡
    福建省有一些农村供销社的人员反对城市小商贩下乡卖货，认为这样会打乱供销社的购销计划，影响农村小商贩的安排，于是他们采取粗暴的办法，禁止小商贩下乡活动。南安县丰州区合作社发动社干部、乡干部到处巡逻，发现泉州市小商贩就予扣留，还要罚处三十元地租。晋江县金登乡、高坑村合作社分销处，派人挡住路口，不准泉州市小商贩从大路上通过，逼使他们扛着货物绕山路走。闽侯县合作社，有的采取正面干涉；有的采取由税务局出面课征10％临时商业税，阻止福州市小商贩下乡。总之，花样很多，目的只有一个——把门关起来。
    实际上，只靠供销社和乡下小商贩的供应是不能满足农民需要的。目前农村商业网虽然经过调整，但仍然是不足的。福建晋江专区是商业网调整较好的地区，沿海农村平均三百到五百户才有一个零售点，只有一、两个商业人员，而且经营品种最多的一百二十五种，少的只有三、五十种，显然是不能满足群众多种多样的要求的。至于内地，零售点更少，群众购买商品更不方便。但是，在城市方面情况就不同了，福州、厦门、漳州、泉州四市，平均每四十户，就有一个商业户；每一百人中，就有三点八四个商业人员。泉州市原有数百个鱼贩，过去专靠挑担子下乡供应的，其它城市也有一些专靠下乡营业的小商贩，现在下不了乡，生活就有很大困难。事实告诉我们，地区经济封锁的结果是：农民的物质需要得不到满足，城市小商贩的生活发生困难，这种做法对谁也没有好处。
    农村合作化后第一个秋收旺季即将到来，城乡市场都将出现前所未有的活跃局面。应该坚决废除一切清规戒律，充分发挥城市小商贩固有的积极作用，让他们自由串乡活动，把工业品带到农村的每一角落。
