Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th. The Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department announced today: On the same night as the Kowloon riots that occurred on October 10th, the Hong Kong Kuomintang special agent command planned to organize explosions, arson, and incite disturbances in Guangzhou. This plot by the Kuomintang special agent agency has completely failed. More than ten batches of agents who infiltrated Guangzhou one after another have all been arrested by our public security organs according to law by the 10th, except for a few who are on the run and are being pursued, and a few who surrendered themselves. The time bombs, incendiary bombs, arson devices, yellow explosives, reactionary leaflets, slogans, and documents carried by the Kuomintang special agents have all been seized.

After interrogation, it was confirmed that these more than ten batches of agents had all received orders in advance from the Hong Kong Kuomintang special agent command to take unified action in the Guangzhou area around 8 pm on October 10th. Among them, Mai Zhong, Wu Man'an, Liu Bingfang, Chen Jin, Mo Yanming, Zhou Hanqin and other batches of agents were ordered to carry various bombs and arson equipment to prepare to explode and burn Zhongshan Theatre, Changshou Theatre, Taiping Theatre, United Theatre, Changdi Cinema, Guangzhou Restaurant, Nan Guo Hotel, Haizhu Park, Central Park, Haizhuang Park, Yuexiu Park, Huanghuagang, and the Foshan Railway Station and other public places with dense crowds; Huang Jiu, Huo Biying, Chen Ying, Chen Yongren, Zhou Shiliang, Chen Xibiao and other batches of agents were scheduled to distribute leaflets, post slogans, and draw Double Ten symbols in Henan District, Jixiang Road, Weixin Road, Xiaobei Road and other places, attempting to incite disturbances.

These more than ten batches of agents who infiltrated Guangzhou this time all lived in Hong Kong in the past. Before the 10th, they were sent by the Hong Kong Kuomintang special agent command to Guangzhou to carry out the above-mentioned sabotage missions. Before their departure, the heads of the special agent agency encouraged them, saying that on the "National Day" of October 10th, the "President" (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) ordered unified action in various places to show the strength of the "counterattack" and must do a great job; and demanded that they be ruthless, and if the target could not be bombed, they should bomb where there were many people, and hotels, civilian houses, and pedestrians on the road could be bombed, just seeking to make the bombs explode.

During their stay in Hong Kong, these more than ten batches of agents were trained in various techniques such as using bombs, incendiary materials, and distributing leaflets to carry out instigation in Room 206 on the second floor of the Longhua Hotel on Jordan Road, Kowloon, and other places, and conducted internships. Taiwan special agent agencies also sent "cadres" such as Wu Rongkun, the action section chief of the "Intelligence Bureau," and Qiu Kongyuan, the chief executive of the Second Office of the "Central Committee Second Group," to Hong Kong to preside over this conspiracy.

Before nightfall on October 10th, some of the agents had successively scouted the terrain of the Guangzhou Restaurant, Taiping Theatre, Yuexiu Park and other planned bombing and arson targets. However, this set of conspiracies failed completely before it could be realized. These more than ten batches of agents, except for a few who were on the run and a few who surrendered themselves, were all arrested on the spot or in advance. On October 10th, not a single bomb exploded in Guangzhou.

The person in charge of the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department said that the successful cracking of this major case of the Hong Kong Kuomintang special agent command instigating agents to conspire to carry out sabotage and incite disturbances in Guangzhou should first of all be attributed to the close cooperation between the broad masses of the people and the public security organs. The people played a great role in helping to solve the case. (Attached picture)

    广州破获国民党特务阴谋骚乱案
    潜入的十多批特务除几名在逃几名自首外全部被逮捕
    新华社广州16日电　广东省公安厅今日宣布：10月10日发生九龙大暴乱的同日晚间，香港国民党特务指挥机关阴谋在广州市组织爆炸、纵火、煽动骚乱。国民党特务机关的这一阴谋已全部失败，先后潜入广州的十多批特务除有几名在逃正在缉捕中、几个投案自首外，其余的到10日止已全部被我公安机关依法逮捕。国民党特务分子所带的定时炸弹、燃烧弹、纵火器、黄色炸药和反动传单、标语、证件等已被全部缴获。
    经过侦讯证实，这十多批特务事先都接获香港国民党特务指挥机关发出的关于10月10日晚八时左右在广州一带统一行动的命令，其中麦忠、吴满安、刘炳芳、陈金、莫炎明、周汉勤等几批特务，奉命分别携带各种炸弹和纵火器材准备爆炸和焚烧中山戏院、长寿戏院、太平戏院、联合戏院、长堤电影院、广州酒家、南国饭店、海珠公园、中央公园、海幢公园、越秀公园、黄花岗以及佛山火车站等群众密集的公共场所；黄就、霍碧莹、陈英、陈永仁、周世良、陈锡标等几批特务预定分别在河南区、吉祥路、维新路、小北路等处散传单，贴标语，画双十标志，企图煽动骚乱。
    这次潜入广州的十多批特务，过去都住在香港。10日前由香港国民党特务指挥机关派来广州执行上述破坏任务。临行时，特务机关首脑分子曾勉励他们说，10月10日“国庆节”，“总统”（按指蒋介石）命令各处统一发动，显示“反攻”力量，必须大干一下；并要求他们心要狠，目标炸不到时，那里人多炸那里，旅馆、民房、路上行人都可以炸，只求炸弹一声响。
    这十多批特务住香港期间，曾分别在九龙佐顿道龙华酒店二楼二百零六号房间等地受到使用炸弹、燃烧物、散发传单进行煽动等各种技术训练，并进行了实习。台湾特务机关还派出“干员”如“情报局”行动科长吴荣坤，“中委会二组”二室总干事裘孔渊等专程到香港，主持这一阴谋。
    10月10日入夜前，部分特务已先后侦察过广州酒家、太平戏院、越秀公园等预定的爆炸、纵火目标的地形。但是，这一套阴谋计划没能实现就彻底失败了。这十多批特务除几个在逃、几个投案自首外，其余都当场或事先被逮捕。10月10日，广州市没有爆炸一颗炸弹。
    广东省公安厅负责人说，这次破获香港国民党特务指挥机关指使特务阴谋在广州进行破坏煽动骚乱的重大案件，首先应归功于广大人民同公安机关的密切合作。人民群众对帮助破案起了极大作用。（附图片）
