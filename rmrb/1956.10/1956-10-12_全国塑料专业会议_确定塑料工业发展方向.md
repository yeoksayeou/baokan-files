Xinhua News Agency Report: The Ministry of Chemical Industry and the Ministry of Light Industry recently jointly convened a National Plastics Professional Conference, which determined the development direction of China's plastics industry and the arrangement for future plastics production.

The conference determined that next year, the plastics industry, which mainly relies on imported raw materials, will be transformed into a plastics industry that can supply its own main raw materials. The production volume of phenolic plastics, which ranks first in the plastics industry, will increase by about 20%. Efforts will be made to start large-scale production in the plastics industry with ample supply of domestic raw materials after 1958.

Plastics is an industry that has seen tremendous development in the last decade. Many industrial sectors cannot be separated from plastics in the development of modern high-tech levels. Because plastics have various properties, they can be as strong as metal, as transparent as glass, and as elastic as rubber, and they are also low in cost. Therefore, it has become an indispensable and important material for many heavy industries, light industries, construction industries, national defense industries, and music and film equipment industries.

At the plastics exhibition held at the conference, the wide range of uses of plastic products were also introduced to the audience. From the very small buttons on shirts to the steering wheel of the Liberation brand automobile, they are all made of plastic. Among the various plastic products produced in Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Dalian, Changchun, Chongqing and Guangzhou, there is organic glass used as window glass for airplanes, automobiles, and ships, and soft polyvinyl chloride film used for making raincoats and precision instruments. The daily necessities made of plastics are even more varied, including thermos bottle shells, belts, eyeglass frames, soap boxes, spoons, and hair clips for women, totaling dozens of kinds.

    全国塑料专业会议
    确定塑料工业发展方向
    据新华社讯　最近化学工业部和轻工业部联合召开了全国塑料专业会议，确定了我国塑料工业的发展方向和今后塑料生产的安排。
    会议确定，明年将使主要依靠进口原料的塑料工业转为我国自己能够供应主要原料的塑料工业；占塑料工业第一位的酚酫塑料的生产量，将增长20％左右。争取到1958年以后，有本国原料充分供应的塑料工业，开始大规模生产。
    塑料是在最近十年来才得到巨大发展的工业。许多工业部门，在现代的高度技术水平的发展中，都不能离开塑料。因为塑料具有着各种各样的性能，它能像金属般的坚牢，像玻璃般的透明，像橡胶样的有弹性，而且成本低。因此，它就成为许多重工业、轻工业、建筑业、国防工业，以及音乐、电影器材等工业部门不可缺少的重要材料。
    在会议所举办的塑料展览会上，还向观众们介绍了塑料产品的广泛用途。从很小的衬衫上的钮扣一直到解放牌汽车上的方向盘，都是用塑料制成的。在上海、北京、天津、大连、长春、重庆和广州等地生产的各种塑料产品中，有用作飞机、汽车、轮船窗玻璃的有机玻璃，有用作制造雨衣和精密仪器的软聚氯乙烯薄膜；用塑料制成的日用品，更是五花八门，热水瓶壳、腰带、眼镜架、肥皂盒、羹匙，以及妇女用的发夹等，共有几十种。
