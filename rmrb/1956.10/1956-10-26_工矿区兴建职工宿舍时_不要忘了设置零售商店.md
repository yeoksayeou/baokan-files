    When Building Staff Dormitories in Industrial and Mining Areas, Don't Forget to Set Up Retail Stores
    In recent years, the supply of daily necessities in industrial and mining areas has indeed been continuously improved. However, with the rapid increase in the population of industrial and mining areas and the rising living standards of workers, the establishment of stores has not been planned.
    For example, in the northern suburb industrial and mining area of Taiyuan City, a large number of staff dormitories have been built in recent years, with each dormitory housing more than a thousand workers. However, when each batch of new dormitories is completed, workers are happy to move into their new homes, but find it too difficult to buy things. Because the factories and mines did not closely cooperate with the commercial departments when building the dormitories and did not appropriately set up commercial networks. However, the supply problem must be solved, so the factories and mines have to allocate a portion of the staff dormitories to set up stores. As a result, the completed new dormitories have to undergo a period of intensive reconstruction work: demolishing sleeping platforms and stoves, enlarging doors and windows, and breaking through walls. However, dormitories are, after all, single or double rooms, each only fifteen to twenty square meters, which is very small to be used as a business room. The room is filled with shelves and counters, and a small amount of goods. When three or five customers come in, the business room becomes crowded, so some retail stores have to let customers buy goods outdoors, exposing them to the sun and rain.
    The sales staff of the retail stores also have many opinions. They say that the business room is small and also has to serve as a warehouse. There is no place to store more goods, and if there are fewer goods, the variety is incomplete, and the workers are not satisfied. Furthermore, a retail store is divided into seven or eight business rooms, making it difficult to take care of each other. Some salespersons even have to lock the store door when they go to the toilet.
    I think this situation should be reversed. Currently, more and more staff dormitories are being built in industrial and mining areas, and the supply work is becoming more arduous. We suggest that factory and mining enterprises should closely cooperate with commercial departments and set up commercial networks while building dormitories. In addition to the commercial departments focusing on establishing comprehensive shopping malls in industrial and mining areas, it is generally welcomed by workers to set up retail stores in larger dormitories that mainly sell vegetables, tobacco, alcohol, and non-staple foods. When workers happily move into their new homes, retail stores immediately supply the daily necessities that workers need, making their lives more enjoyable. Wang Ziyi

### 工矿区兴建职工宿舍时  不要忘了设置零售商店

    工矿区兴建职工宿舍时  不要忘了设置零售商店
    几年来，工矿区的日用品供应工作确实在不断改进着。但随着工矿区人口的迅速增加和职工生活的日益提高，商店的设置，并没有有计划地安排。
    如太原市北郊工矿区，几年来建筑了大量的职工宿舍，每个宿舍中多的住有千多职工。但是当每一批新宿舍落成，职工们愉快地搬进新居时，却感到购买东西太困难。因为各厂矿在兴建宿舍的时候，并没有同商业部门密切配合，适当地设置商业网。可是供应问题又是非解决不可，所以厂矿部门只好将职工宿舍让出一部分设立商店。这样一来，已完工的新宿舍就又要进行一番紧张的改建工作：拆除卧炕、火台，扩大门窗，打通墙壁等。但宿舍毕竟是单间或双间的，每间只不过十五至二十平方公尺，勉强作为营业室用是十分狭小的。室内摆上货架、柜台，再存放少量货品，一间房子就占满了。同时进来三、五个顾主，营业室内便拥挤起来，所以有的零售店就只得让顾主在室外买货。这样顾主便要遭受日晒雨淋之苦。
    零售店的营业人员也很有意见。他们说，营业室很小还要兼作仓库，多进商品无处存放，商品少了，品种不全，职工们不满意。再说，一个零售店，分成七、八个营业室，互相照料很困难，有的营业员去上厕所也得把商店的门锁起来。
    我认为这种情况应该扭转了。目前，工矿区愈来愈多的职工宿舍在兴建，供应工作更加繁重了。我们建议：厂矿企业部门，应与商业部门密切配合，在建筑宿舍的同时设置商业网。除商业部门应在工矿区重点建立综合性的商场外，在较大的宿舍中，设立以经营蔬菜、烟酒和副食品为主的零售商店，是职工们普遍欢迎的。当职工们愉快地搬进新居的时候，零售店马上供应职工们所需要的生活日用品，让职工们生活的更愉快。　王子毅
