Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, 23rd: Moroccan Sultan Yusuf arrived in Tunisia on October 22 for a formal visit. He will meet here with Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba and leaders of the "Algerian National Liberation Front" to seek ways to end the Algerian war, which has been going on for two years.

Before departing for Tunisia, the Moroccan Sultan met in Rabat with leaders of the "Algerian National Liberation Front," including Ben Bella and Mohammed Khider, and invited them to hold talks in Tunisia.

Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, 23rd: The French authorities in Algeria used trickery to kidnap five leaders of the "Algerian National Liberation Front" who had been invited by the Moroccan Sultan to Tunisia to hold talks with the Moroccan Sultan and the Tunisian Prime Minister.

The five leaders are Ben Bella, Mohammed Khider, Hocine Aït Ahmed, Mohammed Boudiaf, and Mostefa Lacheraf.

After meeting with Moroccan Sultan Yusuf in Rabat on the evening of the 20th, they boarded a plane on the evening of the 22nd to go to Tunisia to participate in talks between Tunisia and Morocco on resolving the Algerian issue. The plane they were traveling on was piloted by a Frenchman. After taking off from Rabat, the plane did not fly to Tunisia but circled over the Mediterranean Sea near Algiers. It wasn't until the scheduled arrival time in Tunisia that the plane landed at the White House military airport in Algiers. The five Algerian national leaders were immediately arrested by French police who had been waiting there and sent to prison.

Upon receiving the news, Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba immediately summoned the French Ambassador to Tunisia, lodged a strong protest with him, and warned that the arrest of Algerian national leaders might force the entire North Africa to contend with France.

The Tunisian government has decided to recall its ambassador to Paris.

The Moroccan Sultan also immediately sent a telegram to Paris to protest.

    摩洛哥苏丹访问突尼斯
    寻找结束阿尔及利亚战争途径
    法国用诡计绑架阿尔及利亚民族领袖
    据新华社23日讯　突尼斯消息：摩洛哥苏丹优素福10月22日到达突尼斯作正式访问。他将在这里同突尼斯首相布尔吉巴和“阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线”的领袖举行会谈，谋求结束已经进行了两年的阿尔及利亚战争的途径。
    摩洛哥苏丹在动身前往突尼斯之前，曾经在拉巴特同“阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线”的领袖本·贝拉和穆罕默德·基德尔等人会面，并且邀请他们去突尼斯举行会谈。
    新华社23日讯　阿尔及尔消息：阿尔及利亚法国当局用诡计绑架了应摩洛哥苏丹邀请去突尼斯同摩洛哥苏丹和突尼斯首相举行会谈的“阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线”的五个领导人。
    这五个领导人是本·贝拉、穆罕默德·基德尔、胡基奈·艾特·艾哈迈德、穆罕默德·布迪亚夫和穆斯塔法·拉什雷夫。
    他们20日晚间在拉巴特同摩洛哥苏丹优素福会晤之后，在22日晚间乘飞机到突尼斯参加突尼斯和摩洛哥就解决阿尔及利亚问题举行的会谈。他们乘坐的飞机是由法国人驾驶的。飞机从拉巴特起飞后，并没有飞往突尼斯，而是在靠近阿尔及尔的地中海上空盘旋。一直到预定到达突尼斯的时间飞机才在阿尔及尔的白屋军用飞机场降落。阿尔及利亚五个民族领袖当场被早就守候在那里的法国警察逮捕起来，送进监狱。
    突尼斯首相布尔吉巴得到消息后，马上召见了法国驻突尼斯大使，向他提出严重抗议，并且警告他说，逮捕阿尔及利亚民族领袖可能迫使整个北非同法国较量力量。
    突尼斯政府已经决定召回它在巴黎的大使。
    摩洛哥苏丹也马上打电报向巴黎提出了抗议。
