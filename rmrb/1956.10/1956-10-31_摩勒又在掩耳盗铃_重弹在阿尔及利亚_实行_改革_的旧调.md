Xinhua News Agency, October 30th Dispatch from Paris: French Prime Minister Mollet issued a statement on October 29th, once again urging the Algerian People's forces to "cease fire" and reiterating his promise of implementing "reforms" in Algeria.

When discussing these "reforms," Mollet stated that the French government intends to organize "free and controlled" elections in Algeria to elect a single electoral college, so that Algerian members can participate in the French National Assembly as in the past. Mollet did not mention the demand from the Algerian and French people for immediate negotiations with the true representatives of the Algerian people. Instead, he said that after the elections, the French government would negotiate with "representatives of Algerian citizens" to improve the "fundamental laws of Algeria and the system representing Algerian characteristics." These laws will be implemented under the "arbitration" of the French side.

Mollet slanderously labeled the Algerian insurgents as "terrorists" and demanded that the Algerian insurgents "cease fire."

    摩勒又在掩耳盗铃
    重弹在阿尔及利亚
    实行“改革”的旧调
    新华社30日讯　巴黎消息：法国总理摩勒10月29日发表声明，再次要阿尔及利亚人民部队“停火”，并且重新提出关于在阿尔及利亚实行“改革”的诺言。
    摩勒谈到这些“改革”的时候说，法国政府打算在阿尔及利亚组织“自由而有控制”的选举，选出一个单一的选举院，以便使阿尔及利亚的议员像过去那样参加法国国民议会。摩勒不提阿尔及利亚人民和法国人民所提出的关于立即同阿尔及利亚人民的真正代表谈判的要求，而只是说，在选举以后，法国政府将同“阿尔及利亚公民们的代表”谈判，以改善“阿尔及利亚的根本法律和代表阿尔及利亚特征的制度”。这种法律将在法国方面的“仲裁”下执行。
    摩勒诬蔑阿尔及利亚的起义者为“恐怖分子”，他要求阿尔及利亚起义军“停火”。
