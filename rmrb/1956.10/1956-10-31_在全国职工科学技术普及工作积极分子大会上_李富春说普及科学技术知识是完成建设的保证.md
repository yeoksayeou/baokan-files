Xinhua News Agency, October 30th – Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun said today at the first National Conference of Active Workers in Science and Technology Popularization that the gradual improvement and popularization of science and technology can provide a better guarantee for the completion of national construction tasks.
    In his report to over one thousand active workers in science popularization, Li Fuchun first explained the significance of science and technology popularization for national construction, for the people of the whole country, especially for the working class, farmers, and intellectuals:
    First, it is related to whether production can develop and improve, and whether economic construction can be successfully completed;
    Second, it is related to the improvement of the cultural, scientific, and technological levels of industry and agriculture themselves, the improvement of economic levels, and the increase in labor productivity;
    Third, it is related to the improvement of the cultural, scientific, and technological levels of the working class and farmers;
    Fourth, it is related to the improvement of the communist ideology and materialist worldview of workers, farmers, and intellectuals.
    Li Fuchun then said that we are today in a period of new productive forces development. Our country is moving towards an era of large-scale production and modern, collective production. We cannot rely on a little old experience and the proficiency of individual skills, but must rely on the entire working class, farmers, and intellectuals to gradually master modern science and technology.
    Li Fuchun pointed out that when we carry out the popularization of scientific and technological knowledge, we must also conduct ideological education for the masses—we must tell the workers, farmers, intellectuals, and the people of the whole country: We must build the country diligently and thriftily, work hard, and improve our sense of career and responsibility, striving for national industrialization and for mastering and improving science and technology, so that our science and technology can be truly used to develop production and increase labor productivity.
    He said that science and technology popularization is not only to solve the problem of developing production, but also to solve the problem of how to better utilize human, material, and financial resources, avoid waste, and arrange national construction and people's lives more rationally and appropriately.
    When talking about supporting science and technology popularization work, Li Fuchun believed that factory and mine workers' clubs are a kind of support. He said that in the current period of diligent and thrifty national construction, the focus of the workers' club's tasks should be on improving the cultural, scientific, and technological levels of workers. From the perspective of long-term interests and current interests, doing so is beneficial to the working class.
    Li Fuchun finally said that science and technology popularization work should start from combining theory with practice, and formulate popularization plans based on the current urgent problems that need to be solved in different units and regions. In addition to basic scientific knowledge, it is also necessary to improve the technical level of workers; the result of popularizing scientific and technological knowledge should be to improve everyone's scientific and technological level by one step, and at the same time, solve some scientific and technological problems in current production.

    在全国职工科学技术普及工作积极分子大会上
    李富春说普及科学技术知识是完成建设的保证
    新华社30日讯　国务院副总理李富春今天在全国第一次职工科学技术普及工作积极分子大会上说，科学技术的逐步提高和普及，可以使国家建设任务的完成获得更好的保证。
    李富春对一千多科学普及工作积极分子的报告中首先说明了科学技术普及工作对于国家建设、对全国人民，特别是对工人阶级、农民和知识分子的意义：
    第一，它关系着生产的能否发展、提高和经济建设能否胜利完成；
    第二，它关系着工农业本身的文化科学技术水平的提高、经济水平的提高和劳动生产率的提高；
    第三，它关系着工人阶级和农民文化科学技术水平的提高；
    第四，它关系着工、农、知识分子的共产主义思想和唯物主义世界观的提高。
    李富春接着说，我们今天是处于新的生产力发展的时期，我们国家正在走向大生产、现代化集体生产的时代，我们不能靠一点点老经验和个别人的手艺的熟练程度办事，而要靠整个工人阶级、农民和知识分子逐步地掌握近代科学技术。
    李富春指出，在我们开展普及科学技术知识的时候，还要对群众进行思想教育——要告诉工人、农民、知识分子和全国人民：我们要勤俭建国，要艰苦奋斗，要提高事业心和责任心为着国家工业化和掌握、提高科学技术而努力，要使我们的科学技术能真正用于发展生产和提高劳动生产率。
    他说，科学技术普及工作，不但是为了解决发展生产的问题，而且要解决如何更好地利用人力、物力、财力，避免浪费，把国家建设和人民生活安排得更合理更恰当的问题。
    在谈到支持科学技术普及工作问题的时候，李富春认为厂矿工人俱乐部是一种支持。他说，在目前勤俭建国的时期，工人俱乐部任务的重点应该在于提高工人文化科学技术水平，从长远利益和目前利益来说，这样做对于工人阶级都是有好处的。
    李富春最后说，科学技术普及工作要从结合实际着手，要根据不同单位、不同地区当前迫切需要解决的问题出发，来制定普及计划。除了基本科学知识以外，还要提高工人的技术水平；普及科学技术知识的结果，要使大家的科学技术水平提高一步，同时又要使当前生产中的一些科学技术问题得到解决。
