    Academy of Sciences Minority Language Survey Team Completes Kawa Language Survey in Ximeng Area
    (Our newspaper’s reporter stationed in Kunming) The Kawa ethnic language survey in the Ximeng area of Yunnan Province has recently been fully completed.
    Staff members of the Kawa ethnic group team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Minority Language Survey Team, surveyed seven locations in twenty-two days. At each location, they recorded approximately two thousand five hundred words, three hundred sentences, and three hundred grammar points, and also recorded some legends and stories. When the Kawa people learned that the survey team had been sent by the government to investigate the languages of the Kawa people in various places and to help the Kawa people create a writing system, they were very excited. They said: Great! Chairman Mao is going to make characters for us. It will be great to have our own characters for studying in the future!

    科学院少数民族语言调查队完成西盟地区佧瓦语调查
    本报讯　云南省西盟地区的佧瓦族语言调查工作最近已全部结束。
    中国科学院少数民族语言调查队佧瓦族小组的工作人员，在二十二天里调查了七个点，每一个点都记下了二千五百个左右的词、三百个句子和三百条语法，并且还记了一些传说和故事。当佧瓦族人民知道调查组是政府派来调查各地佧瓦族语言，帮助佧瓦族人民创造文字的时候，都很兴奋。他们说：好了！毛主席要给我们做字，以后有我们自己的字就好读书了。（本报驻昆明记者）
