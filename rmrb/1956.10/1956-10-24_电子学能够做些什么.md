    What Can Electronics Do?
    Chen Fangyun, Member of the Preparatory Committee of the Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    When we turn on the radio, we can hear not only the Central People's Broadcasting Station and the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station, but also the broadcasting stations of Shanghai and Nanjing, and the broadcasting stations of Moscow and other distant cities. How do these sounds come about? They are brought by radio waves.
    A geological prospecting team arrived in a remote mountainous area and, after hard work, discovered a rich mineral deposit. How eager they are to immediately report this good news to the people of the whole country! What method can they use to achieve this goal? They can use radio communication.
    The role of broadcasting and communication in cultural education and disseminating information is self-evident. They are the earliest and still the two main areas of application of radio. If we include wired telegraph and telephone, then the history of using electricity for communication is even longer. These two uses are already very common today and will have great development. Broadcasting requires better sound quality, while communication requires higher efficiency and speed. What is particularly noteworthy is the development of multi-channel communication. Using one line of wired communication or a pair of transceivers of wireless communication, hundreds or even tens of thousands of pairs of people can talk at the same time. In the future, business contacts between cities will definitely become more frequent, and multi-channel communication will become very necessary.
    Broadcasting and communication are familiar to us, and some individuals believe that the use of electronics is limited to this. But this is not the case. Let's take another look:
    General broadcasting stations only "send sound," but we want to see the person speaking at the same time, especially when volunteers or labor heroes are making reports. Is there a way? Yes, you can use television.
    In the sky above a busy airport, there is thick cloud cover and visibility is poor. How can the airport staff predict how far away the incoming planes are and from what direction they are coming? How can these planes avoid colliding with each other in such bad weather and land safely? Their method is to use radio positioning and radio navigation.
    Television and radio positioning are both achievements of electronic science in the 1930s, and they powerfully illustrate the breadth of the uses of electronics. Today, television is already very common in the world, and our capital, Beijing, will soon install a television broadcasting station. In foreign countries, color television has also become a reality. The method of using radio wave reflection to measure the position of objects (also known as radar) has already been used in aviation, navigation, and many other industries. In addition to the long-used radio direction-finding method, after World War II, a variety of new radio navigation systems have been developed on the basis of radar technology. They can accurately guide airplanes and ships to their destinations safely in bad weather.
    So, is the development of modern electronics in application limited to these? No, far more than that. The examples cited above mainly use the characteristics of radio waves propagating and reflecting in the air, but electric waves and electrons can play a role in a wider variety of things. In fact, the technological achievements of electronics in broadcasting and communication have already been more widely applied to industry and other fields of science and technology.
    We know that the frequency of radio waves is generally very high, so they are also called high-frequency radio waves. Using the eddy currents generated by high-frequency radio waves in metals can heat metals and perform smelting and quenching; using the loss of high-frequency radio waves in dielectrics, plastics can be preheated and laminates can be dried. This has long been adopted in industry. According to Soviet statistics in 1947, the electric power used for high-frequency heating in industry was even more than that used for broadcasting stations.
    Vacuum tubes can detect very small amounts of electricity and amplify them; and almost all physical quantities (such as pressure, vibration, light, heat, temperature) and chemical variables (such as acidity and alkalinity) encountered in industrial and agricultural production can be converted into electricity. Once it becomes electricity, it can be amplified by vacuum tubes and the value can be accurately measured. Therefore, vacuum tubes and electronic methods can be applied to almost every production sector, becoming a useful tool for measurement and testing.
    Using electronic methods to control electrically started machines is also an extremely natural connection. Electron movement is the most sensitive and rapid. Therefore, electronic control is not only already one of the basic technologies for production automation today, but it will inevitably be more widely used in the future when machine operation develops to higher speeds.
    The electronic computer is a modern and great achievement of the combination of electronics and mathematics, and this is another example of the utilization of the high-speed movement of electrons. Electronic computers have already played a great role in engineering calculations and scientific research today, and in the future, they will be the heart of the overall automation of industrial production.
    If various control actions are turned into different electrical signals and transmitted by radio waves, things can be manipulated at a great distance. It has become a reality to use radio to control unmanned airplanes. We all know that rockets for high-altitude and interplanetary flight are very important for scientific research and are the starting point for mankind to conquer space outside the earth. The take-off and flight of rockets will inevitably use directional radio waves emitted from the ground or astronomical phenomena, and will be controlled by electronic methods. Its dynamics and flight rules are very important new issues, but how to make it obey human will to choose a flight path is the work of electronics, and it is a large and complex work.
    The application of atomic power will inevitably accelerate the progress of various construction undertakings, and the requirements for automation and electronic control will be even higher. The atomic energy industry itself, due to the extremely high energy and the harmful effects of radiation on the human body, must also be operated at a certain distance, so it cannot be separated from electronics. The measurement of various radiations must also use electronic technology, and the large-scale use of radioactive isotopes also requires electronic instruments.
    It can be seen that although atomic energy utilizes the energy within the atomic nucleus, it is still inseparable from the electrons outside the nucleus.
    Electronics is a science with a fairly strong comprehensive nature. It utilizes a variety of sciences, first and foremost the achievements of physics. They are of great help to the progress of electronic science. And electronics is worthy of being a beneficial friend of other sciences, and it has also played a great role in helping and promoting their research work.
    Because the measurement of various radiations must use electronic technology, the study of atomic nuclear physics is inseparable from electronics. Modern particle accelerators also need to use high-frequency electromagnetic waves as an energy source for acceleration. Radio spectroscopy uses the absorption phenomenon of molecules and atoms for radio waves to study the fine structure of atoms and the molecular structure under various forms. This can not only greatly supplement the shortcomings of spectroscopy, but also help theoretical physics and chemistry, and has been used in industrial analysis and product control. In biological and metallographic research, electron microscopes help us see things that ordinary optical microscopes cannot see; in geodetic surveying, radio rangefinders can be used to increase the efficiency of measurement; in medicine, electronic methods can be used to measure heart waves and brain waves, and high-frequency radio waves can be used to treat diseases. In astronomy, the combination of electronics has also produced a very important new direction—radio astronomy. Using radio telescopes (antennas with ultra-high directivity) can penetrate into the distant sky like optical telescopes, and can "see" celestial phenomena (referring to receiving radio waves emitted by celestial bodies) whether it is day or night, sunny or rainy. Scientists have discovered multiple independent sources that emit strong radio waves, many of which only emit radio waves and not light waves, so they can only be observed with radio telescopes. These discoveries will be of great help to mankind's understanding of the origin of the universe.
    From this point of view, mastering electronic technology in scientific research, promoting it, and adopting new electronic achievements at any time will accelerate the development of science in the motherland and more confidently catch up with the world level within twelve years.
    All the electronic technologies mentioned above will play an important role in national defense. Radio multi-channel communication can make the command and movement of troops faster; in combat, airplanes equipped with television transmitters can be used to detect the enemy's rear; radar had already become a defensive weapon for predicting enemy aircraft in World War II, and can also be used to accurately control anti-aircraft artillery fire; if the enemy uses high-speed rockets to attack, we can also use radio-controlled rockets to shoot them down in a timely and accurate manner. Of course, we want to develop electronics not for the purpose of war, but the kitchen knife can become a weapon when defending against the enemy. As long as imperialism still exists in the world today, electronics is one of the key technologies in national defense, and this point should be given deep attention.
    Modern electronic technology is like equipping us with the "clairaudience" and "clairvoyance" imagined by the ancients. It can also make our hands more agile and effective. It saves us mental labor, helps us overcome harsh climatic conditions and achieve the safety of aviation and navigation, and it can also allow us to defend against enemy aggression from a great distance. What a significant role this science will play in the motherland's industrial construction, national defense, and cultural undertakings!
    For these reasons, countries around the world are paying great attention to the development of electronics. The Soviet Union's radio industry developed fourfold in the Fifth Five-Year Plan, and the radio industry and instrument industry will be developed as much as possible in the Sixth Five-Year Plan. We must also be determined to lay a solid foundation for this science in the motherland's garden and bear fruit. That is, we must not only develop the application of electronics, but also carry out scientific research work in electronics and develop related technologies and industries.

    电子学能够做些什么
    中国科学院电子学研究所筹备委员　陈芳允
    打开了广播收音机，我们不但可以听到中央人民广播电台和北京人民广播电台的声音，而且还可以听到上海和南京的广播电台的声音，莫斯科和其他遥远的城市的广播电台的声音，这些声音是怎样来的？是无线电波带来的。
    一支地质勘探队到达偏僻的山区，经过艰苦的劳动，发现了某种丰富的矿藏，他们多么想立刻把这喜信报告给全国的人民！他们可以用什么方法来达到这个目的？可以用无线电通信。
    广播和通信对于文化教育、沟通消息所起的作用是不用说的了。它们是无线电最早被应用而今天仍然是最主要的两个方面。如果算上有线电报和电话，那么用电来通信的历史就更久了。这两个用途在今天已经很普遍，还会有很大的发展。广播事业要求更好的播音质量，而通信则要求更高的效率和速度。特别值得我们注意的是多路通信的发展，利用有线通信的一条线路或是无线通信的一对收发信机，可以同时供几百对甚至上万对人通话。将来城市和城市之间业务上的联系一定更频繁，多路通信将变得十分必要。
    广播和通信是我们所熟悉的，个别的人以为电子学的用途也就止于此，其实不然。让我们再看一看：
    一般广播电台只“发送声音”，可是我们想同时看见说话的人，特别是志愿军或是劳动英雄作报告的时候。有没有办法？有，可以用电视。
    在一个业务繁忙的飞机场上空，笼罩着浓厚的云层，能见度很差，机场上的工作人员怎样能预测即将到来的飞机离得多么远，从什么方向来？这些飞机又怎样能够在这样的坏天气里避免互相碰撞而且可以安全地着陆？他们的办法是用无线电测位和无线电导航。
    电视和无线电测位都是三十年代中电子科学的成就，它们有力地说明了电子学用途的广阔。今天电视在世界上已经很普遍，我国的首都北京不久也将安装电视广播台。在外国，彩色电视也已经成为事实。利用无线电波反射来测量目的物位置的方法（也称雷达）则已经在航空、航海以及其他许多事业中被利用。除了久已应用的无线电定向归航方法以外，在第二次世界大战以后还已经在雷达的技术基础上发展了多种多样新的无线电导航系统，它们可以在坏天气里准确地指示飞机和船只安全到达目的地。
    那么，近代电子学在应用上的发展是不是就止于这些呢？不，还远过于此。在上面所举出的例子中所利用的主要是无线电波在空中传播和反射等特性，但电波和电子能够在更多种的事物中起作用。事实上电子学在广播和通信中已有的技术成就早已被更广泛地应用到工业和其他科学技术领域中去。
    我们知道无线电波的频率一般都很高，所以也称为高频电波。利用高频电波在金属中所产生的涡流可以使金属发热并进行冶炼和淬火；利用高频电波在介质中的损耗，可以预热塑胶和烤干层板。这在工业中早已被采用，根据苏联在1947年间的统计，用于工业上高频加热的电功率甚至比用于广播电台的还要多。
    电子管能够检验极小的电量并加以放大；而几乎所有工业、农业生产中所遇到的物理量（如压力、振动、光、热、温度）和化学变数（如酸、碱度）等都可以转换成电量，它一变成了电量就可以用电子管放大并准确地测出数值。因此电子管和电子学方法几乎可以应用到每一种生产部门，成为测量和检验的有利工具。
    利用电子学的方法来控制用电启动的机件也是极其自然的联系。电子运动是最灵敏和快速的，因此电子控制非但在今天已经成为生产自动化的基础技术之一，而且在将来机器运转向更高速度发展时必然会被更普遍地采用。
    电子计算机是电子学和数学相结合的一个近代的巨大成就，这又是电子的高速运动被利用的一个例子。电子计算机在今天已经在工程计算、科学研究中起了很大的作用，而将来是工业生产全盘自动化中的心脏。
    如果把各种控制动作变成不同的电信号而用无线电波传送出去，就可以在很远的距离以外操纵事物。用无线电操纵无人驾驶的飞机已经成为事实。我们都知道高空和星际航行的火箭对于科学研究十分重要，而且是人类征服地球以外的空间的起点。火箭的起飞和航行，也必然要利用地面所发出的定向无线电波或是天文的现象，并通过电子学的方法来进行控制。它的动力学和飞行规律等是非常重要的新问题，但是如何使它能听从人的意志来选择飞行路线，则是电子学的工作，而且是大量而复杂的工作。
    原子动力的应用必然会加速地推动各种建设事业前进，而自动化和电子控制的要求也会更高。原子能工业本身，由于极高的能量和射线的有害于人体，也必须在一定距离以外来操纵，因此也离不开电子学。各种射线的量测更必须应用电子学技术，而放射性同位素的大量使用也需要电子学仪器。
    由此可见，原子能所利用的虽然是原子核内的能量，但还是和核外的电子分不开。
    电子学是一种综合性相当强的科学。它利用了多种科学，首先是物理学的成果。它们对电子科学的进展有很大的帮助。而电子学并不愧为他种科学的益友，它在它们的研究工作中也起了很大的帮助和推动作用。
    由于各种射线的测量必须应用电子学技术，所以原子核物理的研究是离不开电子学的。近代粒子加速器也要利用高频电磁波作为加速的能源。无线电频谱学是利用分子和原子对于无线电波的吸收现象来研究原子的细微结构和各种形态下的分子结构。这非但可以大大地补充光谱学的不足，对于理论物理学和化学都有帮助，而且已经被利用到工业分析和产品控制中去。在生物学和金相学研究中电子显微镜帮助我们看见普通光学显微镜所看不到的东西；在大地测量中，可以应用无线电测距仪使测量的效率增高许多；在医学方面可以用电子学的方法来测量心脏电波和脑电波，并且可以用高频率电波来治疗疾病。在天文学中，由于电子学的结合还产生了一个十分重要的新方向——无线电天文学（也称射电天文学）。利用无线电望远镜（特高定向性的天线）可以和光学望远镜一样地深入到遥远的天空，而且无论在白天或黑夜，晴天或雨天，都可以“看见”天象（指接收天体发出来的无线电波）。科学家们已经发现了多个发射强烈的无线电波的独立射源，其中很多只发射无线电波而不发射光波，所以只能用无线电望远镜观测。这些发现对于人类了解宇宙的起源会有很大的帮助。
    从此看来，在科学研究中掌握电子学技术，推广它，随时采用电子学的新成果，将可以使祖国的科学发展速度提高，在十二年内更有把握地赶上世界水平。
    所有上面说过的电子学技术，在国防事业中都会起重要的作用。无线电多路通信可以使部队的指挥和运动更加迅速；在作战中可以用安装着电视发送机的飞机来侦察敌人的后方；雷达在第二次世界大战中就已经成为预报敌机的防御武器，也可以用来准确地控制高射炮火；敌人如果用高速的火箭来攻击，我们也可以用无线电控制的火箭及时准确地把它击落。当然，我们要发展电子学绝不是为了战争的目的，但是厨房的切菜刀可以在御敌时变成武器，当世界上帝国主义还存在着的今天，电子学在国防上是关键性的技术之一，这一点是应该给以深切的注意的。
    现代电子学技术真像是使我们装备了古代人所想像的“顺风耳”和“千里眼”，它还可以使我们的双手更加敏捷而有效。它替我们节省脑力劳动，帮助我们克服恶劣的气候条件而达到航空和航海的安全，它还可以让我们在很远距离以外来防御敌人的侵略。这一门科学对祖国的工业建设、国防事业、文化事业将起多么重大的作用！
    由于这些原因，世界各国对于电子学的发展都给以极大的注意。苏联在第五个五年计划中无线电工业发展了四倍，而在第六个五年计划中也还要尽量发展无线电工业和仪器工业。我们也必须下定决心，使这一门科学在祖国的园地上打好基础，开花结实。那就是非但要发展电子学的应用，还得要开展电子学的科学研究工作和发展有关的技术和工业。
