Could Publishing Houses Be "Integrated"?
		Zǐ Gāng
		Who can calculate how many publishing house signs there are in Beijing? They are adjusted from time to time, and sometimes split up. Some central ministries have also established their own publishing houses, and one sign after another is hung up.
		What are the strict boundaries of the books published by each house? For example, what reason is there that Zhao Shuli's "Sanliwan" must be published by the Popular Reading Materials Publishing House? Can't "People's Literature," "Writer," and "China Youth" Publishing Houses all publish it? -- As long as the commissioning hand is stretched out a bit. Now I hear that People's Literature Publishing House is going to publish a hardcover edition of "Sanliwan." In this case, the difference between the two seems to be only between "ordinary" and "hardcover."
		Another question is, some works by great Chinese and foreign writers are published as a complete works by "People's Literature," and a selected works is published by "China Youth"; it is the original book, and also the original translation, at most someone is found or the translator writes another preface to explain it all, as if the difference between the two is only between "complete" and "selected." Even if there is a need to publish a selected works in addition to the complete works, why must it be published by another publishing house?
		The prosperity of publishing houses seems to also indicate an abundance of editorial talent. However, the opposite is true. Every publishing house is suffering from a shortage of staff. The older generation is few in number, the middle generation is even fewer, and the new generation needs to grow. Currently, there is an incorrect view among university graduates that becoming an editor is a dead end, so the new blood received by the editorial department is often middle school students. One president said: "Forty middle school students came, and we can't tell if we are running a school or a publishing house?"
		Some leading comrades have said: The work of editing is the creation of creation. Editing is indeed a delicate, complex, and arduous cultural labor. In addition to the specialties of each editorial department, it also requires general knowledge, literary accomplishment, historical knowledge, theoretical foundation... There are probably not many editors who are truly proficient in their business and have high cultivation.
		Publishing houses are so scattered, and everyone is still shouting that the leadership is not strong. Some say that we only have the duty to hand in profits to the higher authorities, and others say that we only have the duty to make self-criticisms to the ministry. Moreover, the feeling of distress is even more common among young editors in publishing houses, because the burden is too heavy for them, and the progress of training in their work is not great.
		In order to correct the scattered situation in our publishing industry, concentrate the existing weak editorial forces, save national paper and printing forces, avoid making readers dizzy with the numerous book lists, wasting money on buying books (different publishing houses publish books with roughly the same content), it is very necessary to reorganize the ranks of the publishing industry.
		If we can consolidate the large and small publishing houses, adjust manpower, unify under the leadership of one department, and separately contact certain professional departments according to categories, I think we can achieve the above-mentioned goals. Many stalls can be closed, the professional editing potential of many people can be brought into play, many young editors can continue to go to university, and many book publishing plans can be arranged uniformly: duplicates can be canceled, and missing items can be ordered. Under one or two comprehensive publishing houses, the work of publishing houses can certainly be done quickly, much, well, and economically. It may be difficult to do this for a while, but it is still necessary to raise it as a problem, I think.

    出版社可否“综合”一下？
    子冈
    谁计算得出北京有多少块出版社的招牌？它们时而调整、时而分家。中央有些部也各自建立了些出版社，一块块招牌在挂出来。
    各家出版的书有什么严格的界限呢？例如，赵树理的“三里湾”，有什么理由非由通俗读物出版社出版不可？“人民文学”、“作家”、“中国青年”等出版社，不全可以出它？——祗要约稿的手伸长一点。现在听说人民文学出版社又要出“三里湾”的精装本了。这么说来，仿佛二者之间的区别就在“普通”和“精装”之间。
    还有一个疑问是，有些中外大作家的作品，在“人民文学”出个全集，在“中国青年”又出个选集；是原书，也是原译，顶多找人或由译者再写序文说明一通，仿佛二者之间的区别就在“全”与“选”之间。即使全集之外还有出选集的必要，为什么非由另一出版社出版不可呢？
    出版社的繁盛，似乎也说明了编辑人才之济济。但是，事实恰恰相反，家家出版社在闹人荒，老一代中一代其数寥寥，新一代有待成长。目前大学毕业生中有一种不正确的看法，认为当编辑是末路一条，于是编辑部收到的新生力量经常是中学生，有一位社长说：“中学生一来来了四十名，我们闹不清是在办学校，还是在办出版社？”
    有的领导同志说过：编辑干的活是创造的创造。编辑确实是一项细致复杂的艰苦文化劳动。除了各个编辑部门的专业而外，还要一般常识、文学修养、历史知识、理论基础……真正精通业务、修养高的编辑恐怕是不太多的。
    出版社如此分散，而大家仍在喊领导不强。有的说我们对上级只有上交利润的份儿，有的说我们只有向部里检讨的份儿。而出版社的青年编辑之中，苦闷之情更是普遍，因为担子对他们说来太重，在工作中锻炼的进度不大。
    为了纠正我们出版界的分散情况，集中使用现有的薄弱的编辑力量，节约国家纸张和印刷力量，免使读者见了众多的书目眼花缭乱，浪费了买书钱（不同的出版社出版了内容大致相同的书），重整出版界的队伍是十分必要的。
    倘若能把大大小小出版社综合归并一下，调整人力，统一受一个部门领导，又分门别类各自和一定的专业部门联系，我想是可以达到上述目的的。很多摊子可以收，很多人的专业编辑潜力可以发挥，很多青年编辑可以继续上大学，很多出书计划可以统一安排：重复的取消，缺少的订进去。在一两个综合性的出版社下，出版社的工作一定可以作到又快又多又好又省。要这样做，一时也许有困难，但作为一个问题提出来，我想还是有必要的。
