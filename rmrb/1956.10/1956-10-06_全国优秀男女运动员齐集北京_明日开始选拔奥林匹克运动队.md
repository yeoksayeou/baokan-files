    全国优秀男女运动员齐集北京
    明日开始选拔奥林匹克运动队
    据新华社讯　两千多名参加中国奥林匹克运动队选拔赛的各地的优秀男女运动员、裁判员和工作人员，目前正陆续向选拔赛的举行地——北京汇集。
    这个规模庞大的选拔赛将在10月7日开始。7日晚将在举行开幕式以后，首先进行两场篮球选拔赛。参加这次篮球选拔赛的将有八个优秀篮球队，其中包括远道来北京的香港和澳门的两个篮球队。
    由一百二十六人组成的香港和澳门的运动队这次还将分别参加足球、游泳、举重和体操选拔赛。预计当他们在6日晚上到达北京的时候，将要受到这里的男、女运动员的热烈欢迎。
    这几天，已经到达北京的运动员都在进行竞赛前最后几天的紧张练习。著名的女子铁饼运动员石宝珠和女子跳高运动员傅雪雁等人每天都在北京体育馆旁新开辟的田径场上，一次又一次地重复她们的练习动作。对于傅雪雁来说，不久以前曾经跳过一公尺六十一公分的山东省选手郑凤荣将要成为她的坚强的竞争对手。
    据选拔赛竞赛处的负责人说，在各项竞赛中都将会出现激烈的竞争场面，并且将会产生许多全国新成绩。射击运动员张鋐在最近的一次练习中，小口径手枪人像靶二十五公尺速射的成绩曾经达到五百九十环（满环是六百环）。次轻量级举重运动员殷国华在最近一次练习中的总成绩达到过三百十五公斤，也远远超过了他自己保持的二百九十五公斤的全国正式纪录。
    在这次为期十二天的选拔赛期间的观众人数将要达到三十万人次，同时约有近二百名新闻记者参加这次选拔赛的报道工作，这都将是中国体育史上空前的盛况。
    在这次选拔赛期间，还将同时举行全国自行车比赛（不是选拔赛），预计参加自行车比赛的将有来自二十七个省、市、自治区的一百二十名优秀男、女自行车选手。
    中国奥林匹克运动队选拔赛具体日程如下：
    篮球：10月7日到15日（都在晚上）。
    足球：10月8日到18日（都在下午）。
    体操：10月10日和12日（上午和下午）。
    举重：10月13日（下午和晚上）。

    射击：10月13日到16日（上午和下午）。
    游泳：10月16日和17日（下午）。
    以上各项选拔赛将分别在北京体育馆和体育馆旁的田径场、北京市先农坛体育场和北京射击场举行。10月19日将在先农坛体育场举行闭幕式。
