    Beijing Map
    Shou Ru
    For a long time, I wanted to buy a relatively detailed map of Beijing, but I never managed to. This March, I happened to find one in a used bookstore, and I happily took it home.
    My daughter Xiao Ying, who had just joined the Young Pioneers, was even more excited when she saw the map. She wanted me to point out the location of her school, the location of Tiananmen, and where Fuxingmen was on the map… She looked at it for a long time, then folded the map and put it in her schoolbag. She said, "I'll take it with me so I can look at it anytime." She also promised me, "I'll keep it safe for you and won't damage it!" I listened and nodded, neither agreeing nor disagreeing.
    Seven months passed.
    Last Sunday, I was planning to visit a friend who had recently moved, and I needed to find that unfamiliar alley on the map. I found the map in Xiao Ying's schoolbag. But when I opened it, I was furious! I shouted to my wife, "Come and see what Xiao Ying has done to this perfectly good map!" She came over, and we both looked down at the map. All I could see was a patch of black ink here, a blob of blue ink there; some black streaks here, and heavy red pen marks there. There was even a picture of a trolleybus that Xiao Ying had cut out from the newspaper that day, pasted next to Beihai Park with a thick layer of glue. In the blank space in the lower right corner of the map, she had drawn a dozen or twenty girls with bows in their hair!…
    I was angry and wanted my wife to call the mischievous girl in. My wife warned me, "When you call her in, you're not allowed to shout or make a fuss. You have to patiently ask her why she messed up the map so badly." I agreed.
    Xiao Ying came skipping in from the yard. Seeing me looking at her "improved" map, she became proud, as if I was looking at her report card with satisfaction. She squeezed into my arms and sat on my lap. I couldn't bring myself to push her away.
      "Why did you scribble all over the map?" I asked her.
      "This map is wrong in many places! I corrected the places that were wrong," she said, smiling, her eyes darting around.
    I suppressed my anger and asked her, "Tell me, how did you correct it?"
    Her hand first pointed to a pile of ink marks, then to the area next to it covered in blue ink, saying, "Look, the map shows an inconspicuous Fan Jia Alley, but it's already a group of large buildings here!" Her long eyelashes fluttered up and down. "We went to the Young Pioneers' activity place the other day, which is here – the map only says it's Shanguo Temple, but it has long been turned into a park. So I drew large buildings and a park on the map."
    "Okay, keep going!" I felt that the tone of my voice was much gentler than before.
      "The map also shows Old Xingbu Street, Baozi Street, and Qiu Zu Alley. How can anyone find those places? They've all been opened up and turned into a large road! So I changed the old streets on the map to how they are today." I looked along her little hand, and indeed, two thick ink lines ran straight from Fuxingmen to Tiananmen. The squares drawn on both sides of the street, needless to say, were Xiao Ying's perspective drawings of the building complexes in her mind.
      "Then why did you draw a big bell and red stars on the map?"
      "Isn't that big bell going to appear on the Telecommunications Building on West Chang'an Street in the future? …Aren't the red stars the Soviet Exhibition Center?"
      "What about this patch of ink?"
      "This is the East Suburb Industrial Area, representing the smoke coming out of the chimneys of the factories. And these girls with bows in their hair are the female workers of the three cotton mills!"
      "What are these squares in the northwest direction?"
    "This is the Geological Institute, this is the Iron and Steel Institute, the Petroleum Institute, the Aviation Institute…" Next to the first two squares, I saw two lines of crooked writing: "My first choice!" I remembered that Xiao Ying knew about first and second choices because she had heard a senior student taking the college entrance exam in our courtyard talking about it this summer vacation.
      "Why did you stick a trolleybus on the map?"
      "Isn't the first trolleybus line going to run next year from Chaoyangmen, through the widened Beihai Bridge, all the way to the zoo!" Xiao Ying's voice rang like a string of bells.
      "What about these little motorboats?"
    "Didn't the newspaper report that after the Yongding River water is introduced to the capital, boats can travel from the moat to Zizhuyuan and even further!"…
    I was enjoying unprecedented joy. I hugged Xiao Ying tightly and kissed her passionately. When my excitement calmed down a little, I took a book of data from the bookshelf and read the following figures like reciting an epic poem: In the past seven years (1949-1955), more than 14 million square meters of housing have been built in Beijing. This figure is equivalent to seven-tenths of the buildings accumulated in Beijing over the centuries. …In the past seven years, the investment in municipal construction alone (excluding building investment) has reached 187.74 million yuan. If this money is converted into gold at 100 yuan per tael, then the gold used for municipal construction in the past seven years is more than 58 tons!
    Beijing, the unprecedentedly rapid pace of construction, has transformed the old Beijing ancient city into a magnificent sight. However, this magnificence is just a starting point, and even more magnificent scenes are yet to come. The Beijing under construction brings us happiness; how should we evaluate the glory it brings to our second generation! "(Attached picture)
    "This is the first trolleybus line that will open next year!"

    北京地图
    寿儒
    很久了，我想买一幅比较详细的北京地图，可是总没有买到。今年3月里，碰巧在一家旧书铺里买到了一张，我高高兴兴地把它拿回家来。
    我那刚刚戴上红领巾的女儿小瀛，看到了这张地图更是格外喜欢。她要我在地图上指出她们学校的位置，天安门的位置，复兴门又在图上那一块……。她看了好半天，随手把地图叠好，却放进了她的书包里。她说：“我带着它，好随时看看。”并向我提出保证：“一定给您保存好，不给弄坏了！”我听了，也无可无不可地点了点头。
    时间过了七个月。
    上个星期天，我准备去拜访一位新迁居的朋友，要在地图上找一找那条名字生疏的小胡同。我在小瀛的书包里，找出来了那张地图。但当我打开一看，可把我气坏了！我对爱人喊起来：“你快来瞧瞧，这张好好的地图让小瀛给涂抹成什么样子啦！”她走过来，我们低着头在地图上看。只见这儿一片黑墨水，那儿一块蓝墨水；这儿是几条黑道道，那儿又是重重的红笔印儿。这儿又是小瀛那天从报上剪下来的无轨电车的照片，用铜板厚的浆糊，糊在北海公园的旁边。地图的右角空白地方还画上了一二十个头上系着蝴蝶结的姑娘呢！……。
    我生着气，要爱人把顽皮的丫头叫来。爱人向我提出警告：“把她叫进来，可不准和她大吵大闹，要耐心地问问她为什么把好好的地图抹得个七乱八糟。”我答应了。
    小瀛从院子里蹦蹦跳跳地跑进来。见我在瞧她加了工的地图，她得意起来，好像我在平日看她的记分册那样高兴。她挤进我的怀里，坐在我的大腿上。我一时也不好把她一把推开。
      “你为什么在地图上乱涂乱画呢？”我问她。
      “这张地图好些地方都不对头啦！不对的地方，我就把它改过来了。”她一边说一边笑，两只眼睛在滴溜溜地打转。
    我制止着心里的怨气，问她：“你说说，怎么改的？”
    她的手先指着一堆墨道，接着又指在旁边涂了蓝墨水的地方，说：“您瞧，地图上画的是一条不显眼的范家胡同，其实这儿已经是一群大楼了！”她眼帘上的长睫毛，一上一下地闪动着。“我们那天去过队日的地方，就是这儿——图上只写着是善果寺，现在早已变成公园了。所以我在地图上画了大楼和公园。”
    “好，你接着往下讲吧！”我觉得自己说话的声调，比刚才和悦多了。
      “图上还画着旧刑部街、报子街、丘祖胡同呢，它可让人上哪儿找去？现在不是都打通了，修成一条大马路啦！所以我就把图上旧街道改成今天的样子。”我顺着她的小手一瞧，可不是，两条粗墨道，一直由复兴门画过了天安门。街道两旁画出来的方格子，不用说又是小瀛心目中建筑群的透视图了。
      “那么在地图上为什么还画大钟，画红五星呢？”
      “这个大钟，将来不是出现在西长安街电报大楼上吗？……红五星，不是苏联展览馆吗？”
      “这一片墨色呢？”
      “这是东郊工业区。表示一座座工厂的烟囱冒出来的烟。这头上系着蝴蝶结的姑娘，是三个棉纺厂的女工呀！”
      “西北方向这群方格子是那儿？”
    “这是地质学院，这是钢铁学院，石油学院，航空学院……。”头两个方格子旁边，我看见还写着两行歪七扭八的小字：“我的第一志愿！”我想起来，小瀛所以懂得什么第一、第二志愿，是她今年暑假听同院考高中的一个大姐姐说的。
      “干嘛把无轨电车也粘在地图上？”
      “这是明年由朝阳门经过展宽的北海大桥直到动物园，要通行的第一条无轨电车线哪！”小瀛的语音，好像一串音铃似地响着。
      “这些小汽艇呢？”
    “报上不是登着，永定河水引进首都以后，由护城河到紫竹院，到更远的地方，不就可以行船了！”…………
    我享受着从来未有的愉快。我把小瀛紧紧地搂在怀里，狂热地亲她。我兴奋的心情稍稍平静下来，顺手从书架上取下一册资料，像朗诵一页史诗般地读着下面几个数字：七年来（1949—1955年），在北京已经建造了一千四百多万平方公尺的房屋。这个数字相当于北京几百年积累下来的建筑的十分之七。……七年来，仅仅用于市政建设（不包括建筑的投资）就达到了一亿八千七百七十四万元。这些钱，如果折算成一百元为一两黄金的话，七年来用于市政建设的黄金，就有五十八吨之多呵！
    北京，空前迅速的建设脚步，把旧的北京古城，打扮得多么辉煌壮丽了。然而这种辉煌壮丽，还只是个起点，更加辉煌壮丽的图景，还在前面。建设中的北京，它带给我们的是幸福；它带给我们第二代的光辉，又该怎样做个估价呢！“（附图片）
