    The Studious People
    Xiao Hang
    The Bulgarian people are a studious people, and this is especially evident in the good reading habits of ordinary workers and peasants. I heard about this when I first arrived in Sofia, and after visiting some cities and villages and seeing the strong reading atmosphere in both urban and rural areas, I became even more convinced of this. Some workers have more than 300 political, literary, and technical books on their shelves, in both Bulgarian and Russian. The peasant families I visited also had dozens of books each, including pamphlets and thick volumes of collected works by Michurin.
    In a residential library in Sofia, the librarian introduced us to a young reader named Petrov. He is an eighth-grade student and read over 100 books from January to July of this year. In Sofia and Plovdiv, we visited some workers, and the 30-year-old machine fitter Bechev impressed us the most. He read over 100 books in the first seven months of this year. Many housewives are also diligent and eager readers. A 22-year-old housewife from the Sofia sugar factory district, Babekova, read 85 books in seven months this year, including Tolstoy's "War and Peace" and Ehrenburg's "The Storm."
    A fondness for books is not unique to cities. Soviet masterpieces describing collectivization, such as "Virgin Soil Upturned," have been read by many farmers in Bulgaria, and many villages have even organized discussions. In the village of Lazhovo Goryani in the Plovdiv region, the librarian introduced us to some ordinary readers. The 25-year-old production team leader Nachev, who originally only had a third-grade education, can now read large books like Nehru's "The Discovery of India" without any difficulty, and has written evaluations of the book. He reads an average of three books per month. The 30-year-old female member Tsvietkova reads two books a month and has already read "And Quiet Flows the Don." The reading volume of rural readers is constantly increasing. The library in the village of Draganovo, which we visited, lent out 6,500 books in 1945 and more than 15,000 in 1955.
    The Bulgarian people love literary works, and many workers and peasants are familiar with world-renowned writers and the famous works of Bulgarian figures such as Botev, Vazov, and Vaptsarov. The chairman of the Plovdiv leather production cooperative, Bazhuniqiang, is a busy man who is out buying and selling goods every other day. However, due to his love of classical writers, he still read Pushkin's "The Captain's Daughter," Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment," and a collection of Balzac's novels in the first half of this year.
    The Bulgarian people's interests are not limited to literary works. In addition to participating in political study groups and reading the history of the Bulgarian Communist Party, workers also read a large number of Bulgarian and Russian technical books and periodicals. Agricultural production cooperative members participate in agricultural technology groups in batches, learning agricultural science and technology knowledge, and many members read many books on technical crop cultivation methods. Women are most interested in books about educating children. Many villages have established special education groups, where women read books on communist education for children and receive guidance from local elementary school teachers.
    Chinese works and works introducing China are very popular among Bulgarian readers. The young readers we visited had all read Bulgarian folk tales from China and were able to tell us the plot of the story of "The Liu Brothers." The worker Bechev is very fond of the newly published Bulgarian translation of "Water Margin." He finds it most interesting that when the story reaches its most intense point, the author suddenly stops and says: "Listen to the next chapter," making people want to read it all in one breath. Snow's "Red Star Over China" is circulating among a wide readership. We saw this book in the libraries of several villages, and the cover of the book had been repaired due to excessive borrowing.
    Bulgarian readers are serious. Many residential libraries keep readers' comments on certain books. Some are bound into thick volumes. The housewife Gosheva from Sofia wrote a postscript on the novel "Living Memories," which provided a summary of the contents of this 530-page Bulgarian masterpiece, discussed her understanding, and offered criticisms. Readers' postscripts are one of the bases for writers to improve their work. Some writers often go to residential libraries to read these postscripts. Sometimes, at discussions of works attended by writers, readers also share their postscripts and discuss them with the writers.
    The Party and the government have a deep understanding of the people's habit of loving books and are working hard to create better learning conditions and cultivate this habit. At present, libraries in urban and rural reading rooms across Bulgaria house more than 5.3 million books, which are exclusively for residents to read. In order to develop the rural library cause, the Council of Ministers, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front made a special resolution on July 16, 1955, stipulating that rural libraries with 3,000 books can have a full-time administrator provided by the state. This has given a new impetus to the development of rural libraries. Before the resolution was announced, there were 220 rural libraries with 3,000 books, and in the past year, this number has increased to 650.
    The work of cultivating the people's reading habits is mainly carried out by reading rooms. In Plovdiv, Comrade Polazova, the person in charge of the city's reading rooms, shared her experiences in this regard with us. She quoted a Bulgarian proverb: "Eating stimulates the appetite," and reading itself can cultivate reading habits. Therefore, reading rooms always try to let residents know what books are available, use various methods to attract residents to the library's lending desk, and help residents correctly understand the content of the books.
    Reader meetings are a commonly used form. Large reader meetings have 1,500 participants. These meetings can discuss a famous work at a time, such as "Virgin Soil Upturned," or several books on the same theme. On August 4, when we visited the village of Draganovo, we saw a poster about a reader meeting, which read: Please prepare for the upcoming reader meeting. Discussion topic: The reflection of the youth's struggle for cooperation in literary works. The poster listed a catalog of five works related to this theme to be discussed. Before each reader meeting, such posters are posted to allow everyone to prepare; at the same time, they attract people who have not read these books to participate. At the meeting, someone first gives a brief reading report, and then the attendees discuss the theme, characters, and writing skills.
    The working principle of the reading room is: do not let books sleep on the shelves, let books go wherever there are people. Across Bulgaria, a large number of books are circulating every day. The reading room in Kazanlak regularly sends books to factories and agricultural production cooperatives, 80 to 100 books at a time. In summer, reading rooms set up tents and establish temporary libraries in parks, beaches, mountaintops, and resort areas with mineral springs for people to borrow.
    There are many ways to recommend books to readers. Some reading rooms have bookshelves with thematic introductions. Many reading rooms also exhibit relevant books in conjunction with scientific lectures for the audience to borrow. On the anniversaries of revolutionaries and writers, exhibitions of the revolutionaries' and writers' own works and works introducing these figures are held everywhere. As for displaying new books, it is a method used in almost every village. Sometimes, reading rooms also specially recommend books from one country. At the beginning of this year, the Library Reading Section of the Central Council of the Bulgarian People's Reading Room Association drafted a catalog of Chinese literary works and distributed it to libraries in various cities and larger villages. The catalog included Bulgarian and Russian translations of Chinese literary works. It was also suggested that reading rooms hold Chinese literature evenings. Based on this suggestion, many cities held such evenings in the first half of this year. At the evenings, the development of Chinese literature was discussed, excerpts from some novels were recited, and biographies of certain writers were introduced.
    Experienced reading room staff know that it is always difficult to cultivate reading habits in adults, so people should develop reading habits from an early age. This is also one of the main tasks of urban and rural reading rooms. The reading rooms we visited all had dedicated children's reading rooms, generally 40 to 50 square meters in size. In order to attract young readers, children's literature evenings are held everywhere. At the evenings, exciting passages from children's literature are recited, and sometimes actors are invited to perform certain plots from certain works, with the aim of guiding children to read these books. After listening to the recitations, the children are eager to know the plot of the whole story, and the next day, they are often waiting to borrow books before the library's office hours. Some reading rooms also use this method: for example, after children have read a story book about guerrillas, they organize the children to travel to the mountains and perform the plots of the story to deepen their impression. Cities often hold Children's Book Weeks, which is the largest-scale form of promoting books to children.
    Promoting books and cultivating people's reading habits is a task that is carried out every day among the people of the country, and the scale is very large. The management personnel of Bulgarian urban and rural libraries rely on batches of activists to do this very well. Many reading rooms have library work committees composed of activists, including members of the Youth League, teachers, students, farmers, and housewives. They use their free time from work and study to help the library draw propaganda pictures, display books, organize meetings between writers and readers, hold Children's Book Weeks, give reading reports at reader meetings, and deliver books to residents. For the people's cultural cause, some activists often spend two to three hours of labor every day. They know that this is to work in the depths of people's hearts, and the impact of this work is far-reaching.

    好学不倦的人民
    萧航
    保加利亚人民是好学不倦的人民，这特别表现在普通的工人农民都有很好的读书习惯。我刚到索非亚的时候，就听说了这一点，后来访问了一些城市和村庄，看到城乡各地很盛的读书风气以后，更加确信了这一点。有的工人，在自己的书架上摆着三百多本政治、文艺和技术书籍，有保文的，也有俄文的。访问过的农民家庭，每家也都有几十本书，这里面有小册子，也有厚厚的米丘林选集。
    在索非亚的一个居民图书馆里，管理员向我们介绍了少年读者彼特洛夫。他是八年级学生，从今年1月到7月读了一百多本书。在索非亚和普罗夫迪夫，我们访问了一些工人，三十岁的机器装配工人贝切夫给我们的印象最深。他在今年的头七个月当中，读了一百多本书。家庭妇女当中也有许多勤学好读的人。索非亚制糖厂区的一位家庭妇女、二十二岁的巴贝科娃，在今年的七个月当中读了八十五本书，其中有托尔斯泰的“战争与和平”、爱伦堡的“暴风雨”。
    爱好书籍不仅是城市特有的现象。苏联描写集体化的名著，像“被开垦的处女地”，在保加利亚有许多农民都读过，许多村庄都还组织过讨论。在普罗夫迪夫州的勒日沃·戈那里村，图书馆管理员给我们介绍了一些普通读者。二十五岁的生产小队长那切夫，原来只有三年级的程度，现在已经可以毫无困难地阅读像尼赫鲁的“印度的发现”这样的大部头书，并且写出了对这本书的评价。他平均每个月要读三本书。三十岁的女社员茨维特科娃每月读两本，她已经读过“静静的顿河”。农村读者的阅读量不断地增长着。我们访问过的得拉干诺沃村的图书馆，1945年借出的书是六千五百本，1955年借出了一万五千多本。
    保加利亚人民热爱文艺作品，许多工人农民都熟悉世界著名的作家，熟悉保加利亚的保泰夫、瓦佐夫、瓦普查罗夫等人的名作。普罗夫迪夫城的皮革生产合作社主席巴茹尼强，三天两头在外面跑，买货卖货，是一个忙人。但是由于对古典作家的爱好，今年上半年仍然读了普希金的“上尉的女儿”，陀思妥耶夫斯基的“罪与罚”和巴尔扎克的小说集。
    保加利亚人民的兴趣并不限于文艺作品。工人除了参加政治学习小组，读保共党史以外，还大量地阅读保文和俄文的技术书刊。农业生产合作社社员一批一批地参加到农业技术小组，学习农业科学技术知识，许多社员阅读了不少关于技术作物栽培方法的书籍。妇女们对关于教育子女的书籍最感兴趣。不少村庄专门成立了教育小组，妇女们在小组里阅读关于对子女进行共产主义教育的书籍，并且接受本村小学教师的指导。
    中国的作品和介绍中国的作品很受保加利亚读者的欢迎。我们访问过的少年读者，都读过保文的中国民间故事，都能够对我们述说“刘兄弟”这个故事的情节。工人贝切夫对新出版的“水浒传”保文译本十分爱好。他觉得最有趣的是写到最紧张的时候，小说的作者突然带住：“且听下回分解”使人只能一口气读下去。斯诺的“西行漫记”在广大读者当中流传着，我们在几个村的图书馆里都看到过这本书，书的封面都因借阅过多而裱糊过了。
    保加利亚的读者是认真的。在好多居民图书馆里，保存着读者写的关于某些书籍的读后感。有的订成了厚厚的一本。索非亚的家庭妇女高舍娃写的关于小说“活着的回忆”的读后感，对这部厚达五百三十页的保加利亚名著的内容有扼要的说明，也谈了自己的理解，并作了批评。读者写的读后感，是作家改进工作的依据之一。有的作家常到居民图书馆阅读这些读后感。有时候，在举行有作家参加的作品讨论会上，读者也把自己的读后感谈出来，同作家讨论。
    对于人民的爱好书籍的习惯，党和政府有深刻的了解，并且努力为人民创设更好的学习条件，培养这种习惯。现在保加利亚全国城乡读书室的图书馆，收藏着五百三十多万本书籍，专供居民阅读。为了发展乡村的图书馆事业，部长会议、保共中央、祖国阵线中央在1955年7月16日作过专门的决议，规定有三千本书的乡村图书馆，可以有一名专职的管理员，由国家供给。这给了乡村图书馆的发展以新的刺激。在决议公布以前，有三千本书的乡村图书馆是二百二十个，近一年来，已经发展到六百五十个了。
    培养人民读书习惯的工作，主要是由读书室来作的。在普罗夫迪夫，全市读书室的负责人波拉左娃同志曾经跟我们谈过这方面的经验。她引用保加利亚的谚语说：“吃东西能刺激胃口”，读书本身就能够培养读书习惯。因此，读书室总要想法使居民知道有些什么书，用各种办法把居民吸引到图书馆的借书台前，并且帮助居民正确地理解书的内容。
    读者会议是普遍采用的形式。大的读者会议，有一千五百人参加。这种会议一次可以讨论一部名著，例如“被开垦的处女地”，也可以讨论同一主题的几本书。8月4日我们访问得拉干诺沃村的时候，曾经看到关于召开读者会议的大字报，写着：请为即将到来的读者会议准备。讨论题：青年为合作化进行的斗争在文学作品方面的反映。大字报上开列了要讨论的有关这一主题的五部作品的目录。每次读者会议，事先都要贴出这样的大字报，让大家准备；同时吸引没有读过这些书的人来参加。开会的时候，先由一个人作简要的读书报告，然后由到会的人就主题、人物、写作技巧展开讨论。
    读书室的工作原则是：不让书籍睡在书架上，哪里有人，就让书籍到哪里去。在保加利亚全国，每天都有大批书籍在流动着。卡占雷克城的读书室，经常给工厂和农业生产合作社送书，每次八十到一百本。夏季，在公园里，海边、山顶以及有矿泉水的休养地区，读书室都搭起帐篷，设立临时图书馆，供人们借阅。
    向读者推荐书籍的方法是很多的。有的读书室设有专题介绍的书橱。很多读书室都配合科学讲演，展览有关的书籍，供听众借阅。逢到革命家、作家的纪念日，到处都要展览革命家、作家本人的著作以及介绍这些人物的著作。至于陈列新书，几乎是每个村子都采用的方法。有时候，读书室也专门推荐一个国家的书籍。今年年初，保加利亚人民读书室协会中央理事会图书阅览科拟定了一份中国文学作品的书目，发到各个城市和比较大的乡村图书馆。书目包括了中国文学作品的保文译本和俄文译本。并且建议各读书室举办中国文学作品晚会。根据这个建议，今年上半年，好多城市都举办了这样的晚会。在晚会上讲述了中国文学的发展状况，朗诵了一些小说的片断，并且介绍了某些作家的简历。
    有经验的读书室的工作人员都知道，培养成人的读书习惯总是困难的，因此应当使人们从小就养成读书习惯，这也是城乡读书室的主要工作之一。我们访问过的读书室，都有专设的儿童阅览室，一般有四十到五十平方公尺的面积。为了吸引小读者，到处都举办儿童读物晚会。在晚会上，朗诵儿童文学作品的精采段落，有时候也请演员表演某些作品的某些情节，目的是引导孩子们去读这些书。孩子们听了朗诵之后，都急于想知道整个故事的情节，晚会的第二天，往往不到图书馆办公的时间就在等候借书了。有的读书室，还采用了这样的方式：例如在孩子们读过一本描写游击队的故事书以后，就组织孩子们到山上旅行，表演故事的情节，加深印象。各城市常常举办儿童书籍周，这是向儿童宣传书籍的最大规模的形式。
    宣传书籍，培养人民的读书习惯，这是每天都要在全国人民当中进行的一项工作，规模是很大的。保加利亚城乡图书馆的管理人员依靠成批的积极分子，把这件事情作得十分出色。很多读书室都由积极分子组成了图书馆工作委员会，积极分子包括了青年团员，教师，学生，农民，家庭妇女，他们利用工作和学习的空闲时间，帮助图书馆画宣传画，陈列书籍，组织作家同读者的会见，举办儿童书籍周，在读者会议上作读书报告，并且给居民送书。为了人民的文化事业，有些积极分子常常每天都要付出二至三个小时的劳动。他们知道，这是为了在人们的心的深处作工作，这工作的影响是深远的。
