Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 18th: Heilongjiang Province held a grain work conference on the 16th, deploying this year's autumn grain procurement tasks. At the same time, it proposed measures to continue rectifying the unified purchase and sale of grain in urban and rural areas, requiring all localities to conscientiously implement the national grain policies.

The meeting criticized the erroneous thinking of some cadres who, seeing the improvement in the grain situation and the realization of advanced cooperativization in rural areas, believed that the grain problem had been fundamentally solved. Under the guidance of this thinking, the original supply system has been relaxed in current grain sales, with users being given as much as they want. In some places, residents' rations are not supplied when there is a shortage of grain, but are increased equally across the board. As a result, the products of the food processing industry are piling up, and the atmosphere of wastefulness of grain by government organizations, groups, and residents is rising again, creating an abnormal situation in grain sales.

The meeting demanded that from now on, all localities should first organize forces to conduct inspections, find out the population figures and the reasons for the increase in grain sales, adjust some of the excessively high indicators, and eliminate the phenomenon of duplicate supplies. All government organizations, factories, and enterprises are required to strictly implement the grain ration supply system, and are not allowed to fraudulently claim or waste grain. Grain supply departments must immediately stop the supply methods of reporting actual expenses for reimbursement or state contracted supply for some groups. If the ration is insufficient, appropriate subsidies can be given. And according to the principle of saving enough to eat, the supply of surplus parts of residents' rations should be compressed. The commercial departments should uniformly arrange the grain supply for the cooked food industry and the pastry industry in accordance with market needs, delineate areas, determine production plans and allocation plans, and stop competitive sales and blind development. Due to the harvest of new grain, the supply of grain to rural areas in need should also be strictly and reasonably controlled.

The meeting proposed to widely carry out publicity on saving grain among employees and residents, exchange experiences in saving grain, and resolutely eliminate grain waste.

    黑龙江省整顿粮食购销工作
    要求各地切实执行国家粮食政策
    新华社哈尔滨18日电　黑龙江省在16日召开粮食工作会议，布置今年秋季征购粮任务，同时提出继续整顿城乡粮食统购统销工作的措施，要求各地切实贯彻执行国家的粮食政策。
    会上批判了有些干部看到粮食情况有了好转，农村已经实现了高级合作化，因而就认为目前粮食问题已经根本解决了的错误思想。在这种思想指导下，当前在粮食销售上放松了原有的供应制度，用粮者要多少给多少，有些地方对居民的口粮，不是缺粮时供应，而是一律平均增加。结果，食品加工业的产品积压，机关团体和居民浪费粮食的空气又在抬头，造成了粮食销售的不正常情况。
    会议要求从现在开始，各地首先要组织力量进行检查，摸清人口数字和粮食销售增长的原因，调整某些偏高的指标，消灭重复供应的现象。要求各机关、工厂、企业严格执行粮食定量供应制度，不准冒领或浪费。粮食供应部门要立即停止对某些团体用实报实销，国家包干的供应办法。如果定量不足，可以给予适当补助。并且要根据节约够吃的原则，压缩居民口粮多余部分的供应。对熟食业、糕点业的粮食供应要在适应市场需要的情况下，由商业部门统一安排，划定地区，确定生产计划和调拨计划，制止竞销和盲目发展。对农村缺粮供应，由于新粮已经收获，也要严格的合理的控制。
    会议提出要对职工、居民广泛开展节约粮食的宣传，交流节约粮食的经验，一定要杜绝粮食浪费。
