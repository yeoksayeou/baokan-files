Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Representatives from pharmaceutical companies in twenty-seven provinces and cities across the country recently held a pharmaceutical conference in Tianjin. At the meeting, various regions mutually adjusted more than 400 kinds of traditional Chinese medicines. Through the adjustment, the supply problem of more than 240 kinds of medicinal materials that are very scarce or even out of stock in various markets can basically be solved. In addition to purchasing a large amount of raw herbs, pharmaceutical companies in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai also supplied various pills, powders, plasters, and elixirs to various regions, including the famous Shanghai Feng Liao Xing Medicinal Wine, Ge-made Pinellia, Tianjin Baihua Dingchuan Tablets, and Beijing Niuhuang Jiedu Pills and other prepared medicines.
	This meeting focused on criticizing the "piecemeal rejection, reluctant acceptance, and rejection of non-dry goods" and other red tape existing in the past purchasing work in various regions. The meeting believes that the current period is the peak season for medicinal materials to enter the market, and all regions must vigorously organize procurement and mutual adjustment. In purchasing work, we must first pay attention to purchasing various medicinal materials produced in our own region, and then organize personnel to go out for purchasing; and we should use the old business relationships of private personnel and small vendors in this industry to carry out purchasing through joint purchasing or commissioned purchasing.

    大力组织中药的收购和供应工作
    各地药材公司代表在天津举行药材会议
    据新华社讯　全国二十七个省市药材公司的代表最近在天津举行药材会议。会上各地互相调剂了四百多种中药。经过调剂，目前各地市场十分缺少甚至脱销的二百四十多种药材的供应问题，基本上可以得到解决。北京、天津、上海的药材公司在会上除购买了很多生药外，还供应各地各种丸、散、膏、丹等，其中有著名的上海冯了性药酒、戈制半夏、天津的百花定喘片、北京的牛黄解毒丸等成药。
    这次会议着重批判了各地在过去收购工作中存在的“零星不收、认不得不收、货不干不收”等清规戒律。会议认为目前正是药材上市的旺季，各地必须大力组织收购和相互进行调剂。在收购工作中，首先注意收购本地区所产的各种药材，其次再组织人员外出采购；并应利用本行业的私方人员和小商贩的旧有业务关系，通过联合采购或委托代购等方式，进行收购。
