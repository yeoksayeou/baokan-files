Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 12th - China's first high-speed doubling machine has been manufactured at the state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory and has recently been shipped to a cotton textile factory in Shanghai for production evaluation.

　　This high-speed doubling machine can double yarn at a speed of up to 300 meters per minute, which is twice as efficient as ordinary machines. This machine can combine five strands of fine yarn together, and after twisting with a twisting machine, it can be woven into tire cord fabrics for automobiles, airplanes, etc.; it can also combine two strands of fine yarn together, and after twisting, it can be woven into fine fabrics such as gabardine and poplin. When using this doubling machine for doubling, the machine will automatically stop if the yarn breaks. There is a "centralized stop device" every half meter on the machine. If the machine malfunctions, the operator can stop the machine by simply moving any "centralized stop device." In addition, all rotating parts are enclosed to ensure safe production.

    国营天津纺织机械厂制出一台高速并纱机
    新华社天津12日电　我国的第一台高速并纱机已经在国营天津纺织机械厂制造出来，在最近运往上海棉纺织厂进行生产鉴定。
    这台高速并纱机最快的速度每分钟能并三百公尺纱，比普通机器效率高两倍。这台机器可以把五根细纱并在一起，经过拈线机加拈以后，织成汽车、飞机等轮胎的帘子布；也可以把两根细纱并在一起，加拈以后织成华达呢、府绸等比较细的布。使用这种并纱机并纱，纱一断，机器就能自动地停下来。机器上每隔半公尺就有一个“集中关车装置”，一旦机器发生故障，只要操纵机器的工作人员拨动任何一个“集中关车装置”，机器就能停止运转。此外，各个运转部分都是封闭式的，可以保证安全生产。
