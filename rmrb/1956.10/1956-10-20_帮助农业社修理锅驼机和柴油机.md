    Helping Agricultural Cooperatives Repair Traction Engines and Diesel Engines
    Currently, many advanced agricultural cooperatives have traction engines and diesel engines. Take the cooperative we investigated in Jieyu County, Shanxi Province, for example, which has more than ten traction engines and diesel engines. Because these machines can be used to divert water for irrigation, turning dry land into paddy fields, and can be used for drainage and power generation for sideline production, farmers value and love them very much. When the machines were delivered to the cooperative, farmers went to visit them in groups, saying, "We now have things that landlords couldn't afford in the past."
    However, these machines often develop minor problems after being used for a short time. However, the administrators in the cooperatives cannot repair them due to poor technical skills, and minor problems slowly turn into major problems. Although the factories include pamphlets with instructions on how to carry out maintenance when sending these machines, they still cannot solve practical problems for people with low technical and educational levels.
    The cooperative cadres felt very distressed when talking to us about this matter.
    Here, on the one hand, we hope that the industrial production departments will further improve the quality and improve the structure of the machines themselves; on the other hand, we suggest that relevant departments set up maintenance stations in the special zones or counties to regularly assist the cooperatives in carrying out inspections and repairs.

    帮助农业社修理锅驼机和柴油机
    目前各高级农业社里备有锅驼机、柴油机的很多。就以我们在山西省解虞县作调查的那个社来说，就有锅驼机、柴油机十多台。由于这些机器能用来引水浇地，变旱地为水地，能用来排涝，又能用来发电开展副业生产，所以农民很重视很喜爱它。在机器运到社里的时候，农民成群结队的去参观，他们说：“过去地主买不起的东西，咱们都有了。”
    但是，这些机器往往用不多久就发生小毛病了。但是合作社里的管理员因为技术差，修理不好，小毛病慢慢就弄成了大毛病。各工厂在发送这些机器时，虽然附有指导如何进行检修的小册子。但是，对于技术、文化水平较低的人，还是不能解决实际问题。
    社干部和我们谈起这件事，感到非常苦恼。
    这里，我们一方面希望工业生产部门更进一步的提高质量，改进机器本身的结构；另一方面我们建议有关方面在专区或县设立检修站，定时巡回帮助各合作社进行检修和修理工作。    闵庆全
