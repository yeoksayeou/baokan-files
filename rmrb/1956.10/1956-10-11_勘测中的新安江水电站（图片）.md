    The Xin'an River Hydropower Station Under Survey

    A large-scale hydroelectric power station will be built in the lower reaches of the Xin'an River in Zhejiang Province. This is the first giant hydroelectric power station designed and surveyed by our own country, and its power generation capacity is even greater than that of the Fengman Hydropower Station. After the hydropower station is completed, it can supply electricity to cities and villages in the Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou areas. At present, auxiliary projects of the hydropower station have started construction, and the surveying work of the main projects such as the dam, power plant, and switch station is in full swing.

    勘测中的新安江水电站
    浙江省新安江下游，将建设一座规模巨大的水力发电站。这是我国自己勘测设计的第一座巨型水电站，它的发电能力比小丰满水电站还要大。这座水电站建成后，可以供给上海、南京、杭州地区的城市和乡村用电。目前，水电站的辅助工程已经开工，拦河坝、发电厂、开关站等主体工程的勘测工作，正在紧张地进行着。
