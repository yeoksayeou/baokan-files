Xinhua News Agency, October 21st (TASS, New York, October 20th): Representatives of residents of the Okinawa and Ogasawara Islands have submitted a petition to the Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Sobolev, requesting the Soviet representative to help submit the issue of the reintegration of these two island groups into Japan to the Security Council for discussion.

The petitioners expressed the hope that the United States would relinquish its trusteeship rights so that these two island groups could eventually be reintegrated into Japan. The petitioners emphasized that the United States needs the Okinawa and Ogasawara Islands to maintain American military bases there, but the time has come for the United States to stop managing other countries using imperialist methods, because what people want is the peaceful coexistence of countries to ease tensions in the Far East.

The petitioners accused the US authorities of violating the basic rights of the residents of these two island groups. The petitioners said that after the end of the war, the United States deprived the residents of these islands of the right to elect representatives to the parliament, thereby hindering the political progress and the development of civil rights on these islands. In addition, the United States also hinders various free exchanges between the Japanese mainland and these two island groups, and prevents many residents of the Ogasawara Islands who retreated to the Japanese mainland during the war from returning to their hometowns.

The petitioners finally hoped that the Soviet representative to the United Nations would come forward to help realize their wishes: that the Security Council discuss the issue of reintegrating these two island groups into Japan in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.

The petition was signed by more than a dozen people, including the Association for Reintegrating Okinawa into Japan and Nakayoshi Naganori, the former mayor of Shuri City, Okinawa Prefecture.

    冲绳和小笠原居民致函索波列夫
    要求苏联促使安理会讨论两岛归并日本问题
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社纽约20日讯：冲绳群岛和小笠原群岛的居民代表向苏联常驻联合国代表索波列夫提出了一份请愿书，要求苏联代表帮助把这两个群岛重新归并日本的问题提交安全理事会讨论。
    请愿者表示希望美国放弃托管权利，使这两个群岛最后能够重新归并日本。请愿者着重指出，美国需要冲绳群岛和小笠原群岛是为了保存那里的美国军事基地，但是，美国停止用帝国主义方法管理其他国家的时候已经到了，因为人们所希望的是各国和平共处来缓和远东紧张局势。
    请愿者指责美国当局侵犯这两个群岛的居民的基本权利。请愿者说，在战争结束以后，美国剥夺了这些岛屿的居民选举议会代表的权利，从而阻挠这些岛上的政治进步和民权的发挥。此外，美国还阻碍日本本土和这两个群岛之间进行各种自由来往，并且使许多在战争期间撤退到日本本土去的小笠原群岛的居民，不能还乡。
    请愿者最后希望苏联驻联合国代表出面帮助实现他们的愿望：即使安全理事会根据联合国宪章的规定来讨论将这两个群岛重新归并日本的问题。
    在请愿书上签名的有争取冲绳岛重新归并日本协会和前冲绳县首里市市长中吉长纪等十余人。
