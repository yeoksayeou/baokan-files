Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch: According to TASS reports: The Eighth Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) on the 28th heard the report made by WFTU Vice President Diallo on the second item on the agenda. The second item on the agenda was: "The fraternal solidarity of the trade union movement and working people in countries that have achieved independence or are striving for independence in the anti-colonialist struggle."

Diallo pointed out that the tremendous upsurge of the anti-colonialist movement is an important feature of the current international situation. In the context of the upsurge of national liberation struggles and the disintegration of the colonial system, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of working people is getting higher and higher, and the leading role of the working class and the prestige and significance of trade unions are growing.

Diallo pointed out in his report that the solidarity of the working people of all countries in the struggle against colonialism is an important factor in the development of the modern trade union movement. He said that the unity of trade unions can be developed and consolidated in the struggle of the working people in the metropolitan countries and in the countries that have freed themselves from and are freeing themselves from colonialism for common goals. These common goals are: striving for the relaxation of international tensions, striving for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, opposing the intensification of labor intensity, demanding increased wages, demanding the implementation and improvement of social insurance systems, and demanding the fulfillment of trade union rights.

    世界工联理事会会议听取报告
    迪亚洛强调各国劳动人民在反殖民主义斗争中的团结
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社报道：世界工会联合会理事会第八次会议，28日听取了世界工会联合会副主席迪亚洛就第二项议程所作的报告。第二项议程是：“已经争取到独立、或者正在争取独立的国家的工会运动和劳动人民在反殖民主义斗争中的兄弟团结”。
    迪亚洛指出，反殖民主义运动的巨大高涨是现在国际局势的一个重要特点。在民族解放斗争高涨和殖民体系瓦解的情况下，广大劳动人民的积极性越来越高，工人阶级的领导作用、工会的威信和意义都越来越增长。
    迪亚洛在报告中指出，各国劳动人民在反对殖民主义斗争中的团结是现代工会运动发展的重要因素。他说，工会的团结是可以在宗主国以及已经摆脱和正在摆脱殖民主义的国家的劳动人民争取共同目标的斗争中得到发展和巩固的。这些共同目标就是：争取缓和国际紧张局势、争取禁止原子武器和氢武器、反对加强劳动强度、要求增加工资、要求实施和改进社会保险制度、要求履行工会权利。
