Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 20th. State Department Press Officer White said at a press conference on the 19th that the United States does not intend to force American ships flying foreign flags to pay canal tolls to the "Canal Users Association."

According to the Associated Press, the U.S. State Department is uneasy about reports from London on the 18th that the United States is taking a tougher stance on the Suez issue.

The Associated Press also reported that Britain and the United States have disagreed in the current negotiations on canal tolls: The United States advocates that the tolls received by the "Canal Users Association" should be immediately transferred to Egypt after deducting a portion of the "Association's" expenses. However, Britain suggests freezing the portion of the funds that the "Association" intends to give to Egypt and not giving it to Egypt until the Suez issue is finally resolved.

    对缴纳运河通行费问题
    美英两国意见分歧
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院新闻发布官怀特19日在记者招待会上说，美国不打算强迫悬挂外国旗的美国船只向“运河使用国协会”缴纳运河通行费。
    据美联社报道，美国国务院对18日从伦敦传来的消息说美国正在苏伊士问题上采取比较强硬的态度这一点感到不安。
    美联社还报道，英国和美国在目前就运河通行费问题举行的谈判中发生了意见分歧：美国主张“运河使用国协会”所收到的通行费除扣除一部分“协会”的费用外应当随即转交埃及，但是英国建议把“协会”准备交给埃及的那部分款项冻结起来，在苏伊士问题最后解决前不给埃及。
