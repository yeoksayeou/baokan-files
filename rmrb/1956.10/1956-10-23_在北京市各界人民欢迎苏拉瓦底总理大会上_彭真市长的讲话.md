At the Beijing People's Congress Welcoming Prime Minister Suhrawardy
Mayor Peng Zhen's Speech

Respected Prime Minister, honored guests, ladies and gentlemen:

Today, representatives from all walks of life in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, are holding a grand gathering here to welcome Prime Minister Suhrawardy of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and other distinguished Pakistani guests on their friendly visit to our country. On behalf of the people of Beijing, I extend a warm welcome and respect to the Prime Minister and all the distinguished guests, and through the Prime Minister, I express my heartfelt respect to the citizens of Karachi, the capital of Pakistan, and to all the people of Pakistan.

China and Pakistan are close neighbors with a long history of relations. In modern times, both of our peoples have suffered from the disasters of colonialism and have waged resolute and heroic struggles to win and safeguard their national independence. Now, both are building their own countries. Our two peoples need a peaceful environment for building their respective countries and both hope for peace and oppose war. There are common interests between our two peoples, and no conflicting interests. These are the foundations for the development of friendly relations between our two countries. In the past few years, ladies and gentlemen from the government and non-governmental sectors of your country have visited our country one after another, bringing us the deep friendship of the Pakistani people. This time, the Prime Minister has brought us the deep friendship of the Pakistani people. We cherish this friendship very much. We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to the Prime Minister and ask you to convey the deep friendship and cordial greetings of the citizens of our capital and the people of the whole country to the respected citizens of Karachi and all the people of Pakistan.

In recent years, economic and cultural exchanges between our two countries have been developing day by day, and friendly visits to each other are increasing day by day. We believe that this is not only entirely in line with the interests and aspirations of the people of China and Pakistan, but also conducive to peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people are sincerely willing to work with the Pakistani people to develop economic, cultural, and other friendly exchanges between the two countries, and to jointly promote friendly cooperation among Asian countries and safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

Respected Prime Minister, we warmly welcome you to visit our country and hold cordial talks with our leaders. This will play a significant and positive role in strengthening mutual understanding between the two countries and developing friendly relations between the two countries. We welcome the distinguished guests to visit Beijing and other places in our country to understand our various aspects and to give us your valuable advice on the shortcomings in our work.

Respected Prime Minister, your friendly visit will write an important page in the history of Sino-Pakistani relations and further promote the development of friendship between China and Pakistan. I wish Pakistan prosperity and its people happiness.

Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani people!
Long live peace in Asia!
Long live world peace!
