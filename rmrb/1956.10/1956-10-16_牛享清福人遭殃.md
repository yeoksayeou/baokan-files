    "Cattle Enjoying a Life of Leisure While People Suffer"
    It is certainly good to emphasize the protection of draught cattle for the sake of production. However, it becomes a joke to provide for old and disabled cattle that are unable to work.
    According to statistics from Yuntai District, Xin Hai Lian City, Jiangsu Province, the agricultural cooperatives in the district have a total of 299 old, weak, and disabled cattle that have completely lost their ability to work for one or two years. However, the cooperatives still have to maintain them, waiting for them to die of old age.
    Not only that, but there are also 121 calves in the district that, due to congenital deficiencies, are paralyzed, lame, blind, or have skin diseases from birth. After being raised for more than two years, their weight is still less than 30 jin, like dogs. In principle, these cattle can be slaughtered for meat, but the comrades at the animal husbandry inspection station do not approve the slaughter. If they do not approve, then it cannot be slaughtered; slaughtering would be a "crime."
    The capital spent on raising a head of cattle is very large. In addition to eating green grass in the spring and summer, from the Frost's Descent to the Pure Brightness, at least five or six months of forage are needed. Calculating twelve jin per day, half a year requires more than two thousand jin of feed, not counting labor costs. Imagine how much loss the fodder and labor needed for more than four hundred cattle would be!
    Perhaps the inspection authorities are acting out of kindness, believing that stricter control can protect more cattle lives, but we are not "bovine-ists." What protective value is there for cattle that are not beneficial to production? This will only cause economic losses to farmers and be detrimental to production.
    We must protect draught cattle, and we must also protect those old cattle that can still be used. For those cattle, whether large or small, that should be eliminated and cannot be used, they should be slaughtered. We cannot blindly restrict this. Now some cooperative members sarcastically say, "Cattle enjoy a life of leisure while people suffer," and "Cooperatives are also implementing a 'five guarantees' policy for livestock!" We hope relevant departments will consider improving this situation.

### “牛享清福人遭殃”

    “牛享清福人遭殃”
    为了生产，强调保护耕牛，这当然是好的。对病残无耕作能力的牛，也要将它养老，这就成了笑话。
    据江苏省新海连市云台区统计，该区农业社，共有二百九十九头老弱残牛，已完全失掉耕作能力一、二年了，但社里还得保养它，要待它自己老死。
    不仅如此，全区还有一百二十一头小牛，由于先天不足，一生下来，就瘫、跛、瞎、癞，养了二年多，体重还不足三十斤，像个狗似的。照理讲这些牛是可杀掉作肉用的，但畜牧检查站的同志却不批准杀，不批准就不能杀，杀了就是“犯罪”。
    养一头牛，花费的本钱是很大的，除春夏吃青草外，从霜降到清明，这段时间，起码需喂五、六个月草料，每天以喂十二斤计算，半年就得二千多斤饲料，人工还不算。试想四百多头牛所需要的草料和饲养的人工该是一笔多大的损失！
    也许是检查机关出于好心，认为控制严些，可以多保护些牛的生命，可是我们毕竟不是“牛道主义”者，对生产没有益处的牛，有什么保护价值呢？这样只会使得农民经济上受损失，对生产不利。
    我们必须保护耕牛，也要保护那些还能使用的老牛。对于那些该淘汰的、不能用的牛，不管大牛小牛，该杀的就应该杀，不能一味限制，现在有些社员讽刺说：“牛享清福，人遭殃”，“合作社对牲畜也要实行五保政策哩！”这种状况希望有关部门考虑改进。培科、泽修
