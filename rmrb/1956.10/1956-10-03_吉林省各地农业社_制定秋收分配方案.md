Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, October 1st: The harvesting of major autumn crops in Jilin Province is about to begin in full swing. Currently, agricultural cooperatives in various regions are formulating distribution plans in preparation for the autumn harvest distribution.

The autumn harvest distribution trial calculation work in the western Baicheng area of ​​the province is progressing relatively quickly. According to statistics from eight counties, including Baicheng, Kaitong, and Taonan, more than 1,000 cooperatives are conducting distribution trial calculations, and many cooperatives have already formulated autumn harvest distribution plans. In the central part of the province, Dongliao County, more than 200 cooperatives have also completed the autumn harvest distribution trial calculation work. In the process of formulating autumn harvest distribution plans, agricultural cooperatives in various regions, based on the principles of "distribution according to work" and "less deduction and more distribution," repeatedly discussed and corrected various deviations. The Xiaoguang Cooperative in Baicheng County revised its original plan based on the principle of "less deduction and more distribution," increasing the portion distributed to members from 61.7% of the total income to 69%. Many agricultural cooperatives have also made appropriate provisions for widowed, orphaned, and childless households, and meticulously and reasonably resolved issues such as unreasonable imbalances in work points between production teams and production teams, between members and members, as well as omissions, double counting, and errors in work records.

Many agricultural cooperatives that have already formulated distribution plans, judging from the total income and member income in the plans, demonstrate the superiority of advanced agricultural cooperativization this year. Among the more than 200 cooperatives in the Baicheng area that have formulated autumn harvest distribution plans, the vast majority can increase the income of more than 90% of their members. In Dongliao County, among the more than 200 cooperatives that have completed autumn harvest distribution trial calculations, increased production is confirmed in 94% of the cooperatives, and 93.37% of the members can increase their income. In the Yinmahe Agricultural Cooperative in Jiutai County, more than 600 hectares of dry land crops were flooded this year, resulting in almost no harvest. However, due to the bumper harvest of more than 600 hectares of newly opened paddy fields and the existing paddy fields this spring, it is estimated that this year's grain production will increase by more than 3 million catties compared to last year. Each labor day in this cooperative can be divided into 3 yuan and 7 fen. The distribution plan they have formulated ensures that the income of 95% of the members can be increased.

    吉林省各地农业社
    制定秋收分配方案
    新华社长春1日电　吉林省大秋作物的收割工作就要全面展开，当前各地农业社正在制订分配方案，准备秋收分配。
    这个省西部白城地区农业社的秋收分配试算工作进展得较快。据白城、开通、洮南等八个县统计，有一千多个社正在进行分配试算工作，不少社已经订出了秋收分配方案。中部东辽县也有二百多个社完成了秋收分配试算工作。在制定秋收分配方案过程中，各地农业社根据“按劳取酬”“少扣多分”等原则经过反复讨论，纠正了各种偏向。白城县晓光社根据“少扣多分”的原则修正了原订的方案，由原来分配给社员部分占总收入的61.7％提高到69％。许多农业社还对鳏寡孤独户作了适当的照顾，并且细致地合理地解决生产队和生产队之间、社员和社员之间的工分不合理不平衡以及工帐漏记、重记、错记等问题。
    已经制定出分配方案的许多农业社，从方案上的总收入和社员收入看，显示了今年高级农业合作化的优越性。白城地区已制定出秋收分配方案的二百多个社，绝大多数都能使90％以上的社员增加收入。东辽县完成秋收分配试算工作的二百多个社，其中94％的社增产已定，93.37％社员都能增加收入。九台县饮马河农业社今年有六百多公顷旱地作物被水淹，几乎都颗粒不收，但由于今年春季新开的六百多公顷水田和原有的不少水田获得大丰收，估计今年比去年增产三百多万斤粮食，这个社每个劳动日可分三元零七分，他们制定出的分配方案，保证95％的社员都能增加收入。
