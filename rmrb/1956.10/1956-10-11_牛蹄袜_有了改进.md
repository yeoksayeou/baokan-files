    "Ox-Hoof Socks" Have Been Improved
    Letter from Tianjin Textile Dyeing Company: The article "Repeatedly Asked, But No Change" published in the People's Daily on August 12th, made criticisms of our company that were basically correct.

    The mouth of the wool socks produced by our company in 1955 was 11.5 cm, and the ankle was 11 cm, almost the same thickness from top to bottom, which were indeed "ox-hoof socks." The improved products in 1956 have a sock mouth of 13 cm and an ankle of 9.5 cm, which basically eliminates the defect of being the same thickness from top to bottom. However, they still cannot be compared with products from Shanghai (ankle not exceeding 9 cm).

    Why can't we reach the Shanghai product standards? This is because the sock machines used by our company to weave wool socks are generally 120-needle machines, while 96, 104, or 108-needle machines are most suitable for weaving wool socks. Using a 120-needle sock machine to weave wool socks, it is impossible for the ankle to not exceed 9 cm. When we started production, we also felt that these socks were not good enough and asked the commercial departments to consider whether to produce them. The commercial departments believed that consumers needed them, so they were produced in large quantities. We also considered changing the machines, but there were no machines in stock in Shanghai, and custom orders would not be delivered until the second half of 1957 at the earliest. Moreover, after the public-private partnership, the Tianjin sock machine repair shop did not accept entrusted processing, so the machines could not be changed for the time being. This is our company's actual difficulty. As for the problem of wool socks deforming after being washed, we are studying improvements.

### “牛蹄袜”有了改进

专栏：对批评的反应

    “牛蹄袜”有了改进
    天津市织物漂染公司来信：8月12日人民日报发表的“屡叫不改”一文，对我公司提出的批评，基本上是正确的。
    我公司1955年出产的刀绒袜，袜口十一点五公分，脚脖十一公分，几乎上下一般粗，确实是“牛蹄袜”。1956年改进后的产品，袜口十三公分，脚脖九点五公分，基本上消除了上下一般粗的缺点。但是还不能同上海的产品（脚脖不超过九公分）相比。
    为什么达不到上海产品的标准呢？这是我公司织刀绒袜的袜机一般都是一百二十针，而织刀绒袜以采用九十六、一百零四或一百零八针的机器为最合适。用一百二十针袜机来织刀绒袜，要脚脖不超过九公分，是不可能的。在开始生产的时候，我们也认为这种袜不够好，曾请商业部门考虑是否生产，商业部门认为消费者需要，所以就大批生产了。我们也曾想改换机器，但是上海没有现货，定做至早要到1957年下半年才能交货，而天津的袜机修配厂，公私合营以后，都不接受委托加工，因此机器也一时改换不了。这是我公司的实际困难。至于刀绒袜下水变形的问题，我们正在研究改进。
