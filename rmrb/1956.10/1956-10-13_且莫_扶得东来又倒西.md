    Let's Not "Support it to the East Only to Have it Fall to the West"
    After correcting the tendency to neglect the development of rural sideline production in some areas of Guangdong Province, the tendency to neglect grain production is beginning to surface again. This is also a kind of one-sidedness on the part of the leadership, which should be prevented and corrected as soon as possible.

    After criticizing the one-sidedness in agricultural production leadership in Guangdong Province, sideline production, which had once shrunk, is now showing an increasingly active scene. According to statistics from seven special districts, due to the development of temporary sideline occupations in these months, more than 50 million yuan has been earned, with an average of about 1,000 yuan per agricultural cooperative.
    One point that should be noted here is that while actively developing sideline production, the policy of giving priority to the development of grain production must not be shaken in the slightest. At present, some areas in Guangdong Province have shown a phenomenon of neglecting grain production after correcting the tendency to neglect sideline production. It is said that farmers in various parts of Guangdong Province are not as enthusiastic about late rice production this year as they were in the first season. The late rice is growing very poorly in some areas. In Guangning County, the grass in some agricultural cooperatives' paddy fields is taller than the seedlings; in the Chaoshan area, some paddy fields have been plowed due to severe pest damage; in Gaoyao County, several thousand acres of late rice have been withered and damaged by drought. What is the reason? The main reason is that some cadres misunderstood the policy of developing sideline production. Some cadres even mistakenly believe that grain production requires pest control and drought resistance, which is labor-intensive and yields little profit, making it not worth the effort; while sideline production requires less labor, yields quick results, and is highly profitable. In comparison, they are not interested in grain production. Cadres and farmers in Pubei, Dabu County, are indifferent to the autumn drought, believing that engaging in sideline occupations is better than fighting the drought. They say: as long as they can find sideline occupations, even if the late rice is withered by drought, it doesn't matter; if they have money to buy rice, the government will guarantee the supply. Under the guidance of this thinking, agricultural cooperatives in various places have arranged the main labor force for sideline occupations, and field management of late rice has been squeezed out.
    These phenomena of neglecting grain production are still in their infancy. However, as long as it is a mistake, it is best to overcome it when it is in its infancy. In the past, some areas neglected field management work, and now it is too late to remedy it. Now that late rice has entered the maturity stage, field management work can no longer be neglected!

    且莫“扶得东来又倒西”
    广东省一些地区在纠正了忽视发展农村副业生产的偏向以后，忽视粮食生产的偏向又露头了。这同样是领导上的一种片面性，应当及早防止和纠正。
    吴尔祥
    广东省在批判了农业生产领导上的片面性以后，一度萎缩了的副业生产已呈现日趋活跃的景象。据七个专区的统计，在这几个月中，由于开展了临时副业，已收入五千多万元，平均每个农业社收入一千元左右。
    这里应当提出注意的一点，就是在积极发展副业生产的时候，丝毫不能动摇优先发展粮食生产的方针。目前广东省有些地区在纠正忽视副业生产的偏向以后，已经出现忽视粮食生产的现象。据说，今年广东省各地农民对于晚稻生产的劲头大不如今年上造。有些地区的晚稻生长很不好。广宁县有的农业社的稻田里的草比禾苗还长得高；潮汕地区有些稻田已因虫害严重而被犁掉了；高要县有几千亩的晚稻已被旱死旱坏。原因何在？主要在于某些干部误解了发展副业生产的方针。有些干部甚至错误地认为：搞粮食生产既要除虫，又要抗旱，费工多，收益少，得不偿失；而副业生产则是费工少，收效快，得益又大。相较之下，他们对粮食生产就不感兴趣了。大埔县埔北的干部和农民对秋旱无动于衷，他们认为抗旱不如搞副业。他们说：只要能找到副业门路，即使晚稻都给旱死了也不要紧；有钱买米，政府会保证供应。各地农业社就在这种思想指导下，把主要劳动力都安排到副业上，晚稻的田间管理给挤掉了。
    这些忽视粮食生产的现象还处于萌芽的状态。但是，只要是一种错误，最好是在萌芽的时候就克服它。过去有些地区忽视了田间管理工作，现在想补救当然是迟了。现在晚稻已进入成熟期，田间管理工作可不能再忽视了！
