On October 11th, while I was interviewing at the Second Agricultural Cooperative in Gongping Township, Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, I happened upon a happy occasion for the cooperative members. A large group of young men and women, forming a wedding procession, were escorting a newlywed couple towards a large courtyard. The bride, wearing a floral cloth dress and red velvet shoes, walked alongside the groom, dressed "head to toe in new clothes." Behind them, two young men carried the bride's dowry on two large shoulder poles.

Someone nearby told me that the newlyweds were both from the cooperative; the girl was named Yao Qunfang, and the young man was named Feng Houde. Attracted by the joyous event, I followed them.

In the Feng family's main room, after the bride and groom had their wedding ceremony, they were led into the bridal chamber by the wedding procession. At this moment, according to custom, the bride's companion, a girl named Ju Huaizhen who had just married twenty days ago, took out the bride's dowry from the carrying poles in front of the guests. It consisted of: six white city-cloth embroidered pillows filled with cattail floss, a floral quilt weighing more than six pounds, two floral outfits, a student-style blue Lenin suit, a large mosquito net made of Rongchang ramie cloth, a large double-layered floral porcelain basin, and two square mirrors. Ju Huaizhen told everyone that this was only part of the dowry. The other part was over seven hundred work points. Yao Qunfang earned a total of one thousand one hundred work points in the cooperative this year.

The groom's mother, Granny Feng, said in surprise and delight: "None of the girls around here have ever earned more than eight or nine hundred work points, how did you earn over a thousand!" Yao Qunfang blushed and lowered her head, while the girls around her cast envious glances at her.

The groom's aunt, Li Erniang, when she was young forty years ago, spent all day with her mother twisting hemp ropes to make a living. The clothes she wore when she got married were borrowed from her sister, and her dowry consisted only of a quilt given by her brother-in-law and a mosquito net given by her mother. Although life improved after liberation, when her daughter got married in 1952, she only prepared a dowry worth over twenty yuan. She believes that things like what happened to the Yao family's daughter could only happen after joining the cooperative.

When the shy bride had calmed down, I asked her if spending so much money on her wedding would affect the family's life. Yao Qunfang raised her head and replied: "After the cooperative transitioned into a higher-level cooperative this year, there are more types of production, and everyone earns more work points than last year. I only earned four hundred and fifty work points last year. The work points I earned this year are more than double what I earned last year, so I can get sixty more yuan in dividends. Most of my dowry was bought with this money. I only used thirty yuan from my older brother and sister-in-law, so how could their lives be affected?"

    一个农村姑娘的嫁奁
    新华社记者　喻权域
    10月11日记者去四川省温江县公平乡第二农业社采访时，正逢着农业社社员办喜事。一大群青年男女组成的送亲队簇拥着一对新人往一个大院落走去。穿着花布衣红绒鞋的新娘和穿得“通身新”的新郎走在一起，后面两个小伙子挑着两大挑新娘的嫁奁。
    旁边的人告诉记者，这一对新夫妇都是本社的人，姑娘叫姚群芳，小伙子名叫冯厚德。记者被这件喜事所吸引，也跟着他们走去。
    在冯家堂屋里，新郎新娘举行了婚礼之后，被送亲的人引进了新房。这时，按照习俗，新娘的女伴、二十天以前才结婚的姑娘鞠怀珍，当着客人把新娘的嫁奁从挑子里取出来了。那是：六个装满芦花的白市布绣花枕头、一床六斤多重的花被、两件花衣服、一套学生蓝布的“列宁装”、一床用荣昌夏布缝制的大蚊帐、一个双料的大花瓷盆、两把方形的镜子。鞠怀珍对大家说，这只是嫁奁的一部分。另一部分就是七百多个劳动工分。姚群芳今年在社里共作了一千一百个劳动工分。
    新郎的母亲冯婆婆又惊又喜地说：“这附近的姑娘做的工分谁也没过八九百，你怎么一个人就作到一千多呀！”姚群芳红着脸低下了头，周围的姑娘们都向她投以羡慕的眼光。
    新郎的娘娘李二娘，在四十年前年轻时，一天到晚和母亲搓麻绳糊口，出嫁时穿的衣服都是向姐姐借的，嫁奁就只有姐夫送的一床被子和娘娘送的一床蚊帐。解放后生活虽然提高了，1952年她的女儿出嫁时也只办了二十多元嫁奁。她认为像姚家姑娘这样的事，只有入了社才会出现。
    当害羞的新娘恢复平静时，记者问她今年出嫁突然花了这些钱会不会影响家庭生活。姚群芳抬起头来答道：“今年合作社转成高级社后，生产花样多了，大家赚的劳动工分都比去年增加。我去年只赚了四百五十来个工分，今年赚的工分比去年多一倍，可以多分六十来元。我的嫁奁大都是用这笔钱买的，哥哥嫂嫂给我的钱我只用了三十元，他们的生活怎样会受影响呢？”
