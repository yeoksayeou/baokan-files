　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 20th—When Nepalese Prime Minister Acharya returned to Kathmandu today, he spoke to the press about his impressions of his visit to China. He said that China’s territory is so vast and it is so single-mindedly devoted to its own construction that it does not harbor any ambitions to expand its territory. Those who doubt China's peaceful sincerity are wrong. He also said that he did not see any "iron curtain" in China.

　　He also said that the Nepalese government will support Japan and China's entry into the United Nations.

　　Acharya announced that he had invited Premier Zhou Enlai to visit Nepal, and that the invitation had been accepted.
