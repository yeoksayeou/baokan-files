    哥穆尔卡在华沙群众大会上宣布
    党的八中全会标志着新时期的开端
    新华社华沙25日电　10月24日，在华沙的文化科学宫前的广场上举行了有十几万人参加的群众大会。
    在大会开始以前，广场上以及广场四周的所有建筑物上就挤满了人。当波兰统一工人党和政府的领导人在大会主席台上出现时，会场上响起了经久不息的掌声。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡在大会上发表了演说。他说，党中央的第八次全体会议实行了一种具有历史意义的转变，它标志着我们工作中的一个新时期的开端，标志着波兰社会主义建设的历史中一个新时期的开端。党的领导已经把全部真相告诉给工人阶级和全国人民，它不想、也不会对人民作出空泛的诺言。哥穆尔卡接着号召国民经济各部门的职工在改善人民波兰的社会主义经济的伟大事业中帮助党和政府，同党和政府一道寻求关于工人阶级参与他们的工矿企业的管理工作的最好形式，提高劳动生产率，反对浪费和减低生产成本，利用一切可能来提高工农业生产，以满足群众日益增长的需求。
    哥穆尔卡继续说，党的中央委员会第八次全体会议在拟定以波兰工人阶级和人民的需要为根据的正确的社会主义建设道路的同时，也竭力强调指出人民波兰同一切社会主义国家保持紧密联系的重要性，并特别指出波苏同盟的重要性。
    哥穆尔卡随后号召波兰人民反击反动的和反人民的势力企图挑起反苏骚动的一切尝试，反击国际反动势力打算削弱两个兄弟国家人民同盟的一切阴谋。
    这次群众大会举行了约一个小时。群众对哥穆尔卡的演说不时报以热烈的鼓掌。当散会时，会场上连续奏起国际歌，群众队伍秩序井然地离开了会场。
