Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th - News: The Japanese public welcomes the agreement reached yesterday in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations in Moscow regarding the restoration of normal relations between the two countries.

The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement yesterday saying that it was gratifying that the Soviet-Japanese negotiations had reached an agreement. The Socialist Party pointed out that, with the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, Japan's foreign policy has entered a period of major transformation, and that the restoration of diplomatic relations with China should be realized as soon as possible in the future. The Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, Suzuki Mosaburo, said today that the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration is of great significance. The Socialist Party will vote in favor when the Joint Declaration is submitted to the Diet.

The First Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, Nosaka Sanzo, published a commentary in "Akahata" saying that the Japanese Communist Party supports the Joint Declaration of Japan and the Soviet Union and will cooperate with Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama to ensure that the agreement is ratified. Nosaka pointed out that the agreement signed between Japan and the Soviet Union is of extremely great significance not only to Japan but also to Asian and world peace. Nosaka Sanzo called on the Japanese government to reach similar agreements with China and other peace-loving Eastern European countries.

The Japan National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations issued a statement yesterday saying that all Japanese nationals wholeheartedly welcome the agreement reached in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations. The statement said that in order to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union as soon as possible, we must work hard to promote the ratification of the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration. The statement also said that the focus of future movements should be on promoting the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China. The National Council decided at a meeting of its Secretariat on the 18th that the slogan for future movements would be "Immediately recognize the People's Republic of China" and that it would collect 30 million signatures demanding the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

The Standing Council of the Japan-China Friendship Association issued a statement yesterday supporting the agreement reached in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations. The association also pointed out in the statement that for the sake of peace in Asia and the prosperity of Japan, Japan should normalize relations between Japan and China.

The association called on the Japanese government to immediately begin consultations with the Chinese government on the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

The Vice-Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), Ota Kaoru, said, "We warmly welcome this step which is conducive to world peace. Regardless of who has accomplished this, we must transcend differences in position, express our support, and assist in its completion." Ota also said that he is determined to launch a powerful movement to promote the normalization of relations between Japan and China, demanding the return of Okinawa and the abolition of the US-Japan "Security Treaty."

Aichi University Professor Irie Keishiro said that the agreement reached in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations has opened up broad prospects for Japan's international status and will also promote the normalization of relations between Japan and China.

Chairman of the Japanese Red Cross Society, Shimazu Tadasuke, and the Chairman of the National Council of Families of Japanese Detainees, Arita Hachiro, both delivered speeches welcoming the agreement reached in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations. Many Japanese fishermen and families of war criminals expressed their joy at the news of the agreement.

While broad public opinion expressed its welcome, some pro-American conservative forces expressed concern or dissatisfaction with the success of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations. Ikeda Hayato, a representative of the Yoshida faction within the Liberal Democratic Party, issued a statement yesterday, insidiously saying that Japan had suffered a "failure" in the negotiations. They were dissatisfied with the stance taken by Hatoyama in the negotiations, especially dissatisfied that Hatoyama did not insist on unreasonable territorial demands in the negotiations.

    日本恢复日中日苏邦交国民会议昨天发表声明说，全日本国民衷心欢迎日苏谈判达成协议。声明说，为了早日恢复日苏两国的外交关系，我们要努力促使日苏联合宣言获得批准。声明还说，今后的运动方针重点要放在促进恢复日中两国的邦交上。国民会议在18日召开的事务局会议上已经决定，今后的运动口号是“立即承认中华人民共和国”，并且要征集要求恢复日中两国邦交的三千万人的签名。
