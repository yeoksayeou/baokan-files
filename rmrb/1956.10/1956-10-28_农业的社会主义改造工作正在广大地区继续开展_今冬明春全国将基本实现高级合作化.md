    Socialist Transformation of Agriculture Continues in Broad Areas;
    Advanced Cooperativization Will Be Basically Realized Nationwide This Winter and Spring

    (Our Newspaper) Report: The advanced agricultural cooperative movement is continuing to develop. The original hundreds of thousands of small-scale elementary agricultural production cooperatives are being merged and upgraded into advanced agricultural production cooperatives. Many individual farmers who have not yet joined are also joining advanced cooperatives. It is expected that the fully socialist agricultural cooperativization will be basically realized nationwide this winter and spring.

    In the first half of this year, the three municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and the provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Henan, Guangxi, and Qinghai have already achieved advanced agricultural cooperativization, with the number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives accounting for 90%-95% of the total number of farm households in each province and municipality. Most or part of other provinces have also achieved advanced cooperativization. Areas that have not yet achieved advanced cooperativization have also focused on piloting advanced agricultural production cooperatives.

    Through the production practices of the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, advanced agricultural cooperatives in various regions have shown greater advantages than elementary cooperatives in terms of water conservancy construction, increased fertilizer accumulation, improved farming techniques, increased multiple cropping index, the fight against floods and droughts, and the resettlement of widowed, orphaned, and childless members who have lost their ability to work. Entering the fully socialist advanced cooperative has become an urgent demand of the vast number of elementary cooperative members. Provinces and regions that have not yet achieved advanced cooperativization, under the guidance of the broad masses of farmers and based on the specific conditions of their regions, have made plans for the advanced agricultural cooperativization of the entire province and region, and have seized the gaps in agricultural work to conduct preparatory work such as summarizing experiences, training cadres, and explaining policies, in order to lead the advanced agricultural cooperativization movement forward in a planned and step-by-step manner.

    At present, with the exception of the provinces that basically completed advanced cooperativization this spring, the progress of advanced cooperativization in various provinces and regions is as follows: Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces have basically achieved advanced agricultural cooperativization since the beginning of autumn. By the end of September and the beginning of October, the number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives in Hunan Province accounted for more than 90% of the total number of farm households in the province; as of October 15, the number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives in Jiangxi Province accounted for more than 94% of the total number of farm households in the province, and more than 4,000 elementary cooperatives are preparing to upgrade, and it is estimated that by the end of this year, the number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives can reach 97% of the total number of farm households in the province. As of October 11, the number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives in Anhui Province accounted for more than 90% of the total number of farm households.

    The number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives has accounted for more than 80% of the total number of farm households in the province or region in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. As of October 10, the number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives in Jiangsu Province accounted for 84.4% of the total number of farm households in the province, and it is estimated that it will account for 95.7% after the autumn harvest; at present, the number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives in Zhejiang Province accounts for 81.72% of the total number of farm households in the province, and it is estimated that it will reach 95% before and after the autumn harvest; as of mid-October, the number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives in Hubei Province accounted for 80% of the total number of farm households in the province, and it is estimated that it can reach 95% by the end of October; as of the end of September, the number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region accounted for 81.3% of the total number of farm households, and it is estimated that the advanced cooperativization work can be completed in the entire region this winter and spring. In the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, advanced pastoral cooperatives have begun to be piloted, and there are already nineteen advanced cooperatives among the 515 animal husbandry production cooperatives in the entire region.

    The number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives has accounted for more than 60% of the total number of farm households in the province in Shaanxi, Shandong, and Fujian provinces. Before September, the number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives in Shaanxi Province accounted for 64% of the total number of farm households; Shandong Province accounted for 66.5%. According to statistics in early October, the number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives in Fujian Province accounted for 66.55% of the total number of farm households in the province. It is estimated that Shaanxi and Shandong provinces can achieve advanced cooperativization before the end of this year, and Fujian Province can achieve advanced cooperativization before the spring plowing next year.

    The number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives has accounted for more than 50% of the total number of farm households in the province in Gansu and Guizhou provinces. As of September, the number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives in Gansu Province accounted for 54.45% of the total number of farm households in the province. With the exception of a few areas such as Gannan (mostly pastoral areas), the number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives in the spring of next year can account for 90% of the total number of farm households. The number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives in Guizhou Province accounted for 50.4% of the total number of farm households in the province. At present, agricultural cooperatives throughout the province are carrying out autumn harvest distribution work, and advanced cooperativization work will be fully launched in November, and it is planned that advanced cooperativization work can be basically completed before the Spring Festival next year, at which time the number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives will reach 85%-90%.

    The number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives in Guangdong Province and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has reached more than 40%. Guangdong Province began pilot work on merging and upgrading cooperatives in early September; since October, with the exception of some areas with severe drought, most areas of the province are carrying out advanced cooperativization work, and it is estimated that the number of farm households joining cooperatives before the autumn harvest will increase from 45% to 80%, and advanced cooperativization can be basically realized after the autumn harvest. At present, the number of farm households joining advanced agricultural cooperatives in Xinjiang accounts for 42.06%, and 53 counties have basically achieved advanced cooperativization, and it is estimated that the advanced agricultural cooperativization can be basically realized before February next year.

    As of the end of September, the number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives in Sichuan Province accounted for 30.46% of the total number of farm households in the province; it is estimated that the advanced cooperativization work can be basically completed by the end of this year.

    At present, the number of farm households joining advanced cooperatives in Yunnan Province accounts for 28.1% of the total number of farm households in the province. The work of transferring to advanced cooperatives will begin at the end of October and the beginning of November after the autumn harvest distribution is completed. Since September, ten special districts and fifty-eight counties have conducted pilot work in about one hundred townships in the Pingba mountainous area and the alpine mountainous area respectively.

    In the recent period of advanced cooperativization movement, because the provinces and regions have made relatively full preparations in advance, paid attention to implementing the policy of voluntary mutual benefit when merging and upgrading cooperatives, and paid attention to correcting the shortcomings of some cadres being simple, hasty, and unfairly pricing means of production, the progress of the movement has generally been smooth and healthy. For example, in Hunan Province, most of the members of the more than 40,000 newly built advanced cooperatives have a high enthusiasm for production, and have formulated autumn and winter production plans and promptly turned to production. In Jiangxi Province, agricultural and sideline production have been done very well in the work of merging and upgrading cooperatives. According to the inspection, in the 1,196 newly built cooperatives in the four counties of Jiangling and Honghu in Hubei Province, cooperatives with better work in all aspects accounted for 50%, cooperatives with relatively poor work accounted for 34.6%, and cooperatives with more shortcomings accounted for 15.4%; as long as they are rectified, cooperatives with more shortcomings can also be run well.

    In the recent agricultural advanced cooperativization movement, there are also some noteworthy problems to varying degrees in various regions. Many cadres have blindly optimistic emotions about continuing to complete advanced cooperativization this winter and spring, believing that advanced cooperativization is a general trend and that farmers will come by themselves, without the need for further organization and mobilization, and without the need to do in-depth and meticulous ideological work. Some people said: "We have already advanced 60%-70% here, and what is left is just a tail, and we can complete the task by doing it along the way." Some people said: "This year's advanced cooperativization does not need to be a big deal, one big meeting, two small meetings, three reports, and four joining cooperatives, that's all." In areas where progress in cooperativization is slower due to certain restrictions, some cadres have developed impatient emotions of blindly 'catching up with progress' regardless of local conditions. Under the control of the above-mentioned thoughts, some cadres do not deeply publicize and explain the policy of advanced cooperativization to the masses, but forcibly want to achieve 100% advanced cooperativization. Therefore, the phenomenon of cutting down trees and selling livestock and forcing farmers to join cooperatives has occurred in a few places; some places cannot correctly implement the policy, the valuation of means of production joining the cooperatives is too low, and those who should not join the cooperatives are forced to join the cooperatives. There are also a few cadres who have blindly running large cooperatives ideas, thinking that the larger the cooperative, the more it can show the superiority of advanced cooperativization, so regardless of the current production conditions and leadership capabilities, they forcibly merge cooperatives that should not be merged. These problems have aroused the attention of the leadership in various regions and are being checked and resolved.

### 农业的社会主义改造工作正在广大地区继续开展  今冬明春全国将基本实现高级合作化

    农业的社会主义改造工作正在广大地区继续开展
    今冬明春全国将基本实现高级合作化
    本报讯　农业高级合作化运动正在继续发展。原有的数十万个小型初级农业生产合作社正在进行并社升级，转成高级农业生产合作社。还没有入社的少数个体农民，也有许多人参加高级合作社。预计完全社会主义的农业合作化今冬明春在全国范围内将基本实现。
    今年上半年，北京、天津、上海三市，河北、山西、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、河南、广西、青海等省已经实现农业的高级合作化，加入高级社的农户占各省市总农户的90％—95％。其他各省也有大部或一部分地区实现了高级合作化。没有实现高级合作化的地区，也都重点试办了高级农业生产合作社。
    经过春、夏、秋三大季节的生产实践，各地高级农业合作社在兴修水利、增积肥料、改进耕作技术、增加复种指数、同水旱灾害作斗争、安置丧失劳动力的鳏寡孤独社员等方面，都比初级社显示了更大的优越性。进入完全社会主义的高级合作社，已经成为广大初级社社员的迫切要求。还没有实现高级合作化的各省、区，领导方面根据广大农民的要求，按照本地区的具体情况，作了全省、区农业高级合作化的规划，并抓紧农事空隙进行了总结经验、训练干部、讲解政策等准备工作，以便有计划有步骤地领导农业的高级合作化运动向前发展。
    目前，除今年春季已经基本完成高级合作化的省份以外，各省、区高级合作化的进度是这样的：入秋以来基本上实现了农业高级合作化的，有湖南、江西、安徽三省。湖南省到9月底10月初，加入高级社的农户占全省总农户90％以上；江西省到10月15日止，加入高级社的农户占全省总农户94％以上，还有四千多个初级社正在准备升级，预计今年年底以前，加入高级社的农户可达到全省总农户的97％。安徽省到10月11日止，加入高级社的农户占总农户90％以上。
    加入高级社的农户已占本省、区总农户80％以上的有江苏、浙江、湖北三省和内蒙古自治区。江苏省截至10月10日，加入高级社的农户占全省总农户84.4％，预计到秋收以后将占95.7％；浙江省目前加入高级社的农户占全省总农户的81.72％，预计秋收前后将达95％；湖北省到10月中旬为止加入高级社的农户占全省总农户的80％，预计到10月底可以达到95％；内蒙古自治区到9月底止，加入高级社的农户占总农户81.3％，预计全区今冬明春可完成高级合作化工作。在内蒙古牧业区已开始试办高级牧业合作社，全区五百一十五个畜牧业生产合作社中，已有十九个高级社。
    加入高级社的农户占本省总农户60％以上的有陕西、山东、福建等三省。9月份以前，陕西省加入高级社的农户占总农户的64％；山东省占66.5％。福建省在10月初统计，加入高级社的农户占全省总农户的66.55％。预计陕西、山东等省在今年年底以前，福建省在明年春耕以前，可以实现高级合作化。
    入高级社的农户占本省总农户50％以上的有甘肃省和贵州省。甘肃省截至9月份，加入高级社的农户占全省总农户54.45％，除甘南等少数地区（多为牧区）以外，明年春天加入高级社的农户可占总农户的90％。贵州省加入高级社的农户占全省总农户的50.4％，目前全省农业社正在进行秋收分配工作，高级合作化工作将在11月全面开展，计划明年春节前可基本完成高级合作化工作，那时加入高级社的农户将达到85％—90％。
    广东省、新疆维吾尔自治区加入高级社的农户都已达到40％以上。广东省在9月上旬开始进行并社升级的试点工作；10月份起，除部分旱情严重的地区以外，全省大部地区都在进行高级合作化工作，预计秋收以前入社农户将由45％提高到80％，秋收以后可以基本实现高级合作化。新疆目前加入高级农业社的农户占42.06％，有五十三个县基本上实现了高级合作化，预计明年2月以前可以基本实现农业的高级合作化。
    四川省到9月底加入高级社的农户占全省总农户的30.46％；预计高级合作化工作今年年底可以基本完成。
    云南省加入高级社的农户目前占全省总农户的28.1％。转高级社的工作将在秋收分配结束后的10月底、11月初开始。9月份以来，已有十个专区五十八个县分别在平坝山区、高寒山区约一百多个乡进行试点工作。
    在最近一个时期的高级合作化运动当中，由于各省、区事先都做了较充分的准备工作，在并社升级的时候注意贯彻执行自愿互利的政策，并随时注意纠正某些干部简单草率、生产资料作价不够公平合理的缺点，运动的进展一般都是顺利的、健康的。如湖南省新建的四万多个高级社，绝大部分社社员生产情绪都很高，都订出了秋冬生产计划及时转入生产。江西省在并社升级的工作当中，农业副业生产都搞得很好。据检查，湖北省江陵、洪湖等四个县新建的一千一百九十六个社，各方面的工作都做得较好的社占50％，较次的占34.6％，缺点较多的占15.4％；只要加以整顿，缺点较多的社也完全可以办好。
    在最近的农业高级合作化运动中，各地也都程度不同地存在着一些值得注意的问题。有不少干部对今冬明春继续完成高级合作化有盲目乐观情绪，认为高级合作化是大势所趋，农民自己会来，用不着再大力组织动员，用不着做深入细致的思想工作。有的人说：“我这里已经高级化了60％—70％，留下来的只是一个尾巴，捎带着做一下就可以完成任务了。”有的人说：“今年高级化不用小题大做，一大会、二小会、三报告、四入社，就行了。”在受着一定条件的限制、合作化的进度较迟的地区，有些干部发生了不顾本地条件、盲目地‘赶进度’的急躁情绪。在以上种种思想支配之下，有些干部不向群众深入地宣传解释高级化的政策，而勉强要百分之百地实现高级合作化。因此，少数地方已发生了砍伐树木、出卖牲口的现象和强迫农民入社的行为；有的地方不能正确地执行政策，对生产资料入社作价偏低，不应入社的也强求入社。还有少数干部有盲目办大社的思想情绪，认为社越大才越能显示高级合作化的优越性，因而不顾当前的生产条件和领导能力，对不应该合并的社也强求合并。这些问题已经引起各地领导方面的注意，并正在检查解决。
