Comrade Wan Li, Minister of Urban Construction, Speaks

Now, I would like to express some opinions on several issues in urban construction.
　　In recent years, under the leadership of the Central Committee and Party committees at all levels, many cities across the country have carried out construction projects of varying scales according to the needs of economic, cultural construction and people's lives, and have achieved many results. Especially in the inland key construction areas with poor foundations, urgent tasks, and large construction scales, through active efforts and strong support from coastal cities, many difficulties have been overcome, and many new industrial cities are being built at an unprecedented speed.
　　According to the Party Central Committee’s proposal on the second five-year plan for the development of the national economy, the state will continue to establish and actively prepare to establish many new industrial bases in the inland areas in accordance with resource conditions and the principle of rational distribution of productive forces; the original industrial bases in the coastal areas will also be fully utilized and expanded; at the same time, with the development of production, the problems of worker housing, urban transportation and other public service facilities will be gradually solved as necessary and as possible. In this way, many new industrial cities will continue to be built in the inland areas. The material and technical foundations of these areas are even weaker, and many cities are starting from scratch, so the task is arduous. At the same time, the construction tasks of coastal cities will also increase. Under this new situation, it is necessary to "strengthen urban planning and construction work to coordinate with industrial construction."
　　To this end, the following issues should be focused on: increasing strength, organizing collaboration, and doing a good job in surveying and mapping.
　　First, strengthen urban surveying and mapping work in construction areas. In the past, many construction areas lacked the necessary topographic, meteorological, and hydrogeological data due to the weakness of urban surveying and mapping forces, which affected the progress of planning and design. In some areas, although the surveying and mapping forces of several departments were concentrated at the same time, there was a lack of unified leadership and unified management, and they often did not cooperate with each other, resulting in repeated surveys. Sometimes, the surveying and mapping work in some areas was no one's responsibility, resulting in several elevation and coordinate systems in some cities, causing chaos and waste. In order to change this situation, in addition to the urban construction department actively enriching and expanding the urban surveying and mapping forces, it is recommended that the local governments conduct comprehensive arrangements for the surveying and mapping forces of various departments in the same city, organize collaboration, and give full play to their potential. All kinds of surveying and mapping results should be submitted to the local urban construction department for unified storage for use by relevant units. Oppose Subjectivism in Urban Planning and Civil Building Design
　　Second, improve urban planning and civil building design work. In recent years, although some relatively practical urban plans have been prepared, there are varying degrees of subjectivism in the plans of many cities. The manifestation is that no practical investigation and research is done, and one does not proceed from reality, but mechanically transports foreign experience and quotas. Sometimes, one is overly concerned about the future scale of the city and is keen to depict a set of perfect future planning scenarios that cannot be fully realized, but the planning of the recent construction area has not been grasped tightly. Sometimes, one attempts to tear down a large number of houses to inappropriately open up central squares and parks without studying the possible conditions; regardless of the specific conditions, one insists on using a certain fixed form in the road system and inappropriately stipulates the number of floors of buildings. Although most of such plans have not been realized, they have caused a lot of difficulties for the construction units, and some cities have prematurely demolished some buildings. In civil building design, in recent years, many good buildings have appeared, but some mistakes have also occurred, mainly due to the failure to fully implement the policy of "applicability, economy, and attention to beauty under possible conditions." In the past, there was a tendency of revivalism and formalism, and a one-sided pursuit of "beauty"; after overcoming this tendency, last year, one-sided emphasis was placed on "saving," ignoring engineering quality, applicability, convenience, and architectural modeling, and many houses with very poor engineering quality were built, which were neither applicable nor beautiful. Some houses need to be repaired and improved this year. Although this mistake has been corrected and is being corrected, it has caused losses to the country.
　　In order to improve urban planning and civil building design work, we must further oppose subjectivism in practical work, strengthen political leadership, correct design ideas, implement the mass line working method, and strengthen investigation and research work.
　　The preparation of urban planning should be based on the current situation, characteristics, and the scale of various constructions in the city, starting from the near future, combining with the long-term vision, leaving room for development, and proceeding from reality. When carrying out planning, it is necessary to arrange the city's industrial enterprises, transportation, housing, public utilities, public service facilities, suburban agricultural water use and land use as appropriately and reasonably as possible, and coordinate with each other. To do this work well, the urban construction department should take the initiative to strengthen cooperation and better listen to and respect the opinions of various construction units, not only to take care of the reasonable requirements of all parties, find out the contradictions of various units in urban construction, and strive to solve them, but also to prevent certain biases that ignore the overall situation, so as to ensure the rational development of the city and facilitate production, construction and people's lives. At the same time, it is hoped that the state will determine the national productivity distribution plan as soon as possible, organize forces in a planned way, prepare regional plans, and confirm the construction sites of major industrial projects as soon as possible, so that industrial site selection and urban planning have a basis. Before the regional plan is compiled, the joint site selection system should be adhered to and improved so that the plant site is reasonably determined and avoids excessive changes, causing difficulties in planning and design. For existing cities, special attention should be paid to starting from the existing foundation, making full use of existing equipment, and preparing practical plans based on the development of production, the urgent needs of people's lives, and the state's financial possibilities, and gradually carrying out construction.
　　In terms of civil building design, technical leadership must be strengthened and technical levels improved to ensure design quality. In order to adapt to the needs of large-scale construction, it is also necessary to further strengthen and improve the preparation of standard designs according to the different conditions in different regions, the country's current economic level, the production of building materials, and the people's living standards and habits. Unified Arrangement of the Construction of Housing, Municipal Engineering and Public Service Facilities
　　Third, the city's housing, municipal engineering, and public service facilities should be arranged in a unified manner while carrying out industrial capital construction, and should be constructed in phases and batches according to a certain proportion to meet the needs of production and life. In the past, the construction time of these construction projects lacked unified arrangements, and some investment proportions were not appropriate, and even some projects had no investment. Therefore, in general cities, worker housing is very scarce; in some places, although housing has been built, there are no shops, canteens, clinics, and primary and secondary school buildings in some neighborhoods, and public transportation facilities cannot keep up with actual needs; in some cities, factory construction has already started, and the roads and bridges leading to the factory area have not yet been invested in; some roads have been repaired, and they have to be turned over to lay pipelines. The existence of these problems has caused great inconvenience to industrial capital construction and residents' lives.
　　Since this year, everyone has paid more attention to solving the problems of worker housing and welfare, which is very necessary. However, if the possible conditions in all aspects are not considered and the requirements are too high and too fast, it is also unrealistic. Taking Beijing as an example, according to the statistics at the end of August this year, the area of houses that various units require to be built in Beijing next year, including the projects postponed this year, has exceeded 16 million square meters (most of which are residential, office buildings and public buildings). Beijing has built 14.06 million square meters in the six years from 1950 to the end of 1955, and the construction speed has been quite fast. It is required to build so much in one year next year, which is impossible from all aspects of building materials, design, construction, and transportation. In recent years, non-productive construction has not had a relatively accurate plan, sometimes greatly reduced, sometimes greatly increased, or increased and decreased, and decreased and increased again, with too many changes. This makes the design and construction units, especially the construction units, sometimes idle, too idle to die, and sometimes rush to catch up with tasks, too busy to die. In addition to many shortcomings of the design and construction units themselves, it has caused the consequences of poor quality of many projects, frequent accidents, or failure to complete the plan.
　　The above-mentioned situations are difficult to completely avoid due to lack of experience, and it is difficult to fundamentally change them in the future, but measures must be taken to gradually improve them. Therefore, the planning and various balancing work of capital construction should be strengthened, and the proportion of investment in productive construction and non-productive construction should be appropriately determined according to necessity and possibility, and the problems of worker housing and public service facilities should be gradually solved on the basis of production development. It is necessary to oppose not only bureaucratism that does not care about the people's suffering, but also the impetuous and rash tendency that does not consider the country's economic conditions and design and construction conditions.
　　In the process of building a city, the policy of unified planning, unified construction and unified management of housing, municipal engineering and public service facilities should be implemented step by step and with preparation. Municipal engineering pipelines and other off-factory engineering pipelines should be compiled into a unified pipeline integrated design. For housing, municipal engineering, public service facilities and other off-factory projects, efforts should be made to gradually unify the construction progress of various projects. As far as possible, construction should be carried out in the order of "underground first, then above ground." At the same time, the construction management of the city should be strengthened to supervise and inspect the implementation of urban planning and construction plans.
　　The implementation of the above-mentioned measures can reduce or avoid many disputes in the construction process and improve design quality and engineering quality. Replenish Institutions and Train Engineering and Technical Personnel
　　Fourth, in order to ensure the completion of the increasingly heavy urban construction tasks, urban construction departments at all levels must replenish and train engineering and technical personnel commensurate with the tasks. Especially in the inland provinces and autonomous regions with large tasks and a serious lack of original technical forces, it is impossible to complete the construction tasks of a large number of new industrial cities without a certain number of engineering and technical personnel in surveying and design, municipal engineering, construction and installation, and public utility management. A lot of technical forces in coastal cities have been transferred out in the past, and they have not been replenished in time. In the future, the construction tasks of these cities will be heavier, and the forces are already insufficient. Therefore, the urban construction departments of all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions should actively and systematically train new forces, and open secondary technical schools and various professional training courses according to needs and possibilities. At the same time, it is hoped that universities will appropriately increase urban construction majors and classes; and allocate a certain number of university graduates to various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions every year. In addition to cultivating the necessary forces for themselves, coastal cities should continue to provide support to new industrial cities. New cities should prepare cadres and establish institutions as early as possible to adapt to the needs of construction tasks.
　　Urban construction is basically a local undertaking, and work can only be done well by relying on the unified leadership of the local government. It is hoped that Party committees at all levels will strengthen leadership and supervision and inspection. We will, in accordance with the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, promptly be vigilant and overcome subjectivism in our work, and work more diligently and conscientiously to complete the urban construction tasks assigned to us by the Party.

    城市建设要同工业建设相配合
    城市建设部部长　万里同志的发言
    现在，我就城市建设工作中的几个问题发表一些意见。　
  　几年来，在中央和各级党委的领导下，根据经济、文化建设和人民生活的需要，全国许多城市都进行了规模不同的建设工程，取得了不少成绩。特别是在基础差、任务急、建设规模大的内地重点建设地区，经过积极努力和沿海城市的大力支援，克服了很多困难，正以空前的速度建设着许多新的工业城市。
  　根据党中央关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划建议，国家将按照资源情况和合理分布生产力的原则，在内地继续建立和积极准备建立许多新的工业基地；对沿海原有的工业基地，也将充分地加以利用和扩建；同时，随着生产的发展，还将要按照必要和可能，逐步解决职工住宅、城市交通和其他公共服务设施等问题。这样，必将继续在内地建设许多新的工业城市，这些地区，物质技术基础更加薄弱，而且有不少城市是平地起家，因此任务是繁重的。同时，沿海城市的建设任务，也将有所增加。在这种新的形势下，必须“加强城市的规划工作和建设工作，求得同工业建设相配合。”　　为此，应着重解决以下几个问题：增加力量，组织协作，做好勘察测量工作　　第一、加强建设地区的城市勘察测量工作。过去，许多建设地区，由于城市勘察测量的力量薄弱，提不出必要的地形、气象、水文地质等自然资料，影响了规划、设计的进行。有些地区，虽然同时集中了几个部门的勘察测量的力量，但缺乏统一领导和统一管理，往往互不配合，重复勘测。有时某些地区的勘测工作又无人负责，以致有些城市出现几个标高和座标系统，造成紊乱和浪费。为改变这种情况，除城市建设部门应积极充实和扩大城市勘察测量的力量外，建议地方对各部门在同一城市的勘察测量力量，进行全面安排，组织协作，充分发挥潜力。各种勘察测量成果，应交当地城市建设部门一份，统一加以保管，以供有关单位使用。反对城市规划和民用建筑设计工作中的主观主义　　第二、改进城市规划和民用建筑设计工作。几年来，虽然编制了若干比较切合实际的城市规划，但在不少城市的规划中，存在着程度不同的主观主义。其表现是不作切实的调查研究，不从实际出发，机械地搬运外国的经验和定额。有时过分计较城市的远景规模，热衷于描绘一套十全十美的不可能完全实现的远景规划图景，而对近期建设地区的规划却没有抓紧进行。有时对可能条件不加研究，就企图拆掉大批房屋去不适当地开辟中心广场、公园绿地；不管具体条件如何，硬要搬用道路系统中的某种固定形式，不适当地规定房屋建筑层数。这样的规划，虽然大部分没有实现，但已给建设单位造成了不少困难，也有一些城市过多过早地拆掉了一些建筑物。在民用建筑设计中，近几年来，出现了不少好的建筑物，但也发生了一些错误，主要是对“适用、经济、在可能条件下注意美观”的方针全面贯彻不够。过去，曾经发生过复古主义、形式主义的倾向，片面追求“美观”；在克服这一倾向后，去年又片面强调“节约”，忽视工程质量和适用、方便与建筑艺术造型，盖了不少工程质量很差，既不适用，又不美观的房屋。有些房屋，在今年就需要进行修补和改善。这种错误，虽经纠正和正在纠正，但已给国家造成了损失。　　为了改进城市规划和民用建筑设计工作，我们必须进一步反对实际工作中的主观主义，加强政治领导，端正设计思想，贯彻群众路线的工作方法，加强调查研究工作。　　城市规划的编制，应根据城市的现状、特点和各项建设的规模，从近期出发，结合远景，留出发展余地，实事求是地进行。在进行规划时，必须把城市的工业企业、交通运输、住宅、公用事业、公共服务设施、郊区农业用水用地等，力求安排得恰当合理，彼此协调。要作好这一工作，城市建设部门应主动加强配合协作，更好地倾听和尊重各个建设单位的意见，既要照顾各方面的合理要求，找出各个单位在城市建设中的矛盾，努力加以解决，又要防止某些不顾整体的偏向，以保证城市的合理发展，便利生产建设和人民生活。同时，希望国家尽速确定全国生产力分布的方案，有计划地组织力量，编制区域规划，及早肯定重大工业项目的建设地点，以便使工业选厂和城市规划有所依据。在区域规划编出以前，应坚持和改进联合选厂制度，使厂址定得合理，避免变化过多，造成规划设计的困难。对原有城市，应特别注意从现有基础出发，充分利用已有设备，根据生产的发展、人民生活的迫切需要和国家财政的可能，编制切合实际的规划，逐步进行建设。　　在民用建筑设计方面，必须加强技术领导，提高技术水平，以保证设计质量。为了适应大规模建设的需要，还必须根据不同地区的不同情况、国家当前的经济水平和建筑材料的生产状况以及人民的生活水平和习惯，进一步加强和改进标准设计的编制工作。统一安排住宅、市政工程和公共服务设施的建设　　第三、对于城市的住宅、市政工程、公共服务设施，应当在进行工业基本建设的同时，统一加以安排，按照一定的比例，分期分批地进行建设，以适应生产和生活的需要。过去，这些建设项目的建设时间缺乏统一安排，有的投资比例不够恰当，甚至有些项目没有投资，所以在一般城市中，职工住宅非常缺乏；有的地方，虽然修建了住宅，但一些街坊内没有商店、食堂、诊疗所和中小学校的建筑，公共交通设施也跟不上实际需要；有的城市，工厂建设已经开始施工了，通往工厂区的道路桥梁还没有投资；有的道路修好了，又要翻开埋设管线。这些问题的存在，都给工业基本建设和居民生活造成极大的不便。　　今年以来，大家都更多地注意解决职工住宅和福利问题，这是十分必要的。但如果不考虑各方面的可能条件，要求过高过快，也是不现实的。以北京为例，根据今年八月底的统计，各单位要求明年在北京市建筑的房屋面积，连今年推迟的工程在内，已有一千六百多万平方公尺（其中大部分是住宅、办公楼和公共建筑）。而北京市从一九五○年到一九五五年底六年当中，建筑了一千四百○六万平方公尺，建设速度已经相当快了，明年一年就要求建筑这么多，无论从建筑材料、设计、施工、运输等各个方面来看，都是不可能实现的。几年来，非生产性建设一直没有比较确切的计划，忽而大削大减，忽而大大增加，或者增了减，减了又增，变化太多。使得设计、施工单位特别是施工单位，有时窝工，闲得要死，有时突击赶任务，忙得要命，再加设计、施工单位本身的许多缺点，就造成了很多工程的质量很差，事故频繁，或者完不成计划的后果。　　上述种种情况，由于经验不足，很难完全避免，在今后一个时期内也难以根本改变，但必须采取措施，逐步改进。因此，应加强基本建设的计划性和各种平衡工作，按照必要和可能，恰当地确定生产性建设和非生产性建设投资的比例，在生产发展的基础上，逐步解决职工住宅和公共服务设施问题。既要反对不关心群众疾苦的官僚主义，也要反对不考虑国家的经济条件和设计施工条件的急躁冒进倾向。　　在一个城市的建设过程中，还应有步骤有准备地实行住宅、市政工程、公共服务设施的统一规划、统一建设和统一管理的方针。市政工程管线和其他厂外工程管线，应当编制统一的管线综合设计。对于住宅、市政工程、公共服务设施和其他厂外工程，应积极创造条件，逐步地统一安排各个工程项目的建设进度。尽可能按照“先地下、后地上”的程序施工。同时，并应加强城市的建筑管理工作，监督和检查城市规划和施工计划的贯彻执行。　　实行上述措施，就可减少或避免建设过程中的许多扯皮现象，改进设计质量和工程质量。充实机构，培养工程技术人员　　第四、为了保证完成日益繁重的城市建设任务，各级城市建设部门必须充实、培养与任务相适应的工程技术人员。特别是任务大而原有技术力量十分缺乏的内地各省和自治区，如果没有一定数量的勘测设计、市政工程、建筑安装以及公用事业管理的工程技术人员，就不可能完成大量的新工业城市的建设任务。沿海城市的技术力量，过去已调出不少，没有及时补充，今后这些城市的建设任务又将加重，力量已感不足。因此，各省、市、自治区的城市建设部门，都应积极地有计划地培养新生力量，按照需要和可能，开办中等技术学校；举办各种专业训练班。同时，希望高等学校适当增加城市建设的专业和班次；每年给各省、市、自治区分配一定数量的大学毕业生。沿海城市，除了培养自己所必需的力量以外，对新工业城市仍应继续给予支援。新建城市要尽早地准备干部，建立机构，以适应建设任务的需要。　　城市建设，基本上是一个地方性的事业，必须依靠地方的统一领导，才能做好工作，希望各级党委加强领导和督促检查。我们将根据党的第八次全国代表大会的精神，及时警惕和克服工作中的主观主义，更加勤勤恳恳、兢兢业业地，为完成党交给我们的城市建设任务而努力。
