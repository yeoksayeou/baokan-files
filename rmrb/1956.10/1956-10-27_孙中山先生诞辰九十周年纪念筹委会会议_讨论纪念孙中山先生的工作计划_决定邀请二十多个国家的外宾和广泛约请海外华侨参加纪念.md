Xinhua News Agency, October 26th—The Preparatory Committee for the 90th Anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birth held a plenary meeting today to discuss the work plan for commemorating the 90th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth.

The meeting was presided over by Zhou Enlai, Director of the Preparatory Committee. Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee, reported on the progress of the preparatory work, and the meeting then proceeded to discussion, with committee members putting forward many new suggestions.

The meeting requested that the commemorative meetings held in Beijing and various provinces and cities should widely invite representatives from all walks of life at home and abroad, as well as overseas Chinese, to participate. To this end, the meeting decided to extend invitations to foreign guests from more than twenty countries, and at the same time, broadly invite overseas Chinese to send representatives back to China to participate in the commemoration. The Preparatory Committee also decided to universally call on Kuomintang members in Taiwan and scattered overseas to return and commemorate the 90th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth together.

In addition to holding commemorative meetings, factories, schools, government agencies, organizations, and other groups in major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Wuhan, Xi'an, and Chengdu can also hold mass commemorative activities in various forms such as report meetings, lectures, and symposiums, depending on the specific circumstances.

On November 12, people from all walks of life in Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places will visit the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, Sun Yat-sen's Former Residence, and Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum. At the same time, the Preparatory Committee will also send a delegation to Nanjing to visit Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum.

The Preparatory Committee also decided to widely collect Dr. Sun Yat-sen's posthumous works from friends at home and abroad, publish a commemorative pictorial, and reprint Dr. Sun Yat-sen's handwritten "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction." Other commemorative preparations are now being accelerated.

Vice-Chairman Song Qingling has sent a batch of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's calligraphy that she treasured, in preparation for an exhibition. Filmmakers have gone to Nanjing, Guangzhou, and other places to shoot commemorative films, and commemorative stamps will be issued soon.
