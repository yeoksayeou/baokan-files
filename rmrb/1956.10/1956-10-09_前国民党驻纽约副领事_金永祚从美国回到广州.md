Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th. Former Kuomintang government-appointed Deputy Consul in New York, Jin Yongzuo, along with his wife Zhang Zhimin, and children Jin Shiyun and Jin Jimin, returned to China from the United States aboard the "President Cleveland" ship. They arrived in Guangzhou on the evening of the 6th and were welcomed and received by the government.

	Jin Yongzuo is the son of Jin Zhaozhi, the former director of the editorial department of the Zhonghua Book Company. In 1948, he was appointed by the Kuomintang government as Deputy Consul in Winnipeg, Canada, and in 1949 he was transferred to New York, USA, as Deputy Consul. Because he had long been determined to return to the motherland, he resigned from his position as Deputy Consul in 1950. In order to raise travel expenses for his return, he worked as a factory director in a porcelain factory in New York.

	After arriving in Guangzhou, Jin Yongzuo revealed to reporters that when his family left the United States to return to the motherland, the U.S. intelligence agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had repeatedly summoned him for questioning, attempting to prevent him from returning to the motherland. However, the achievements of the motherland's construction and the expectations of his relatives made him steadfastly overcome all difficulties and return to the motherland.

    前国民党驻纽约副领事
    金永祚从美国回到广州
    新华社广州8日电　前国民党政府派驻美国纽约副领事金永祚和他的夫人张志敏，儿女金世芸、金济民等，举家从美国乘克利夫兰总统号轮船回国，于6日晚上到达广州，受到政府的欢迎和接待。
    金永祚是前中华书局编辑所所长金兆梓的儿子。1948年由国民党政府派驻加拿大温尼伯任副领事，1949年调任驻美国纽约副领事。由于他很早便决心返回祖国，因此1950年他就辞去了副领事的职务。为了筹措回国的旅费，他曾在美国纽约的一家瓷器厂担任厂长。
    金永祚在抵达广州后对记者透露：当他举家离美国返回祖国时，美国的特务机关联邦调查局曾经屡次传他去询问，企图阻止他回到祖国。但祖国的建设成就和亲人的盼望使他坚定不移地克服了一切困难回到祖国。
