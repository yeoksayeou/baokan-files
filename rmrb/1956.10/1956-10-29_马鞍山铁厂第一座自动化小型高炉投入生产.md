Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 27th: The first automated small blast furnace rebuilt by the Ma'anshan Iron Works recently went into production.

This blast furnace originally had a small effective volume, and the potential of its auxiliary equipment – hot blast stoves and blowers – could not be fully utilized. After this reconstruction, the hearth was appropriately enlarged and heightened compared to the original, and a belly and throat were added according to the modern large blast furnace style. In this way, it can produce more than 6,000 tons of pig iron per year than before.

The entire charging system of this blast furnace, except for the winch which still requires manual switching, is fully automated. A modern automatic furnace top rotary distributor is installed on the furnace top, and the automatic large and small cover device and automatic recorder and automatic sounding rod successfully developed by Zhang Debao, a labor model of the Ma'anshan Iron Works, are adopted. A signal box is installed in the winding room. With this set of automated equipment, not only can the charging be uniform and more pig iron be produced, but also the labor conditions of workers can be improved. In the past, when plugging the taphole, workers had to brave the high temperature of the furnace fire and push the mud gun to plug it. Now, by simply pressing the switch, the mud gun automatically plugs the sparking taphole.

Ma'anshan Iron Works has five more blast furnaces that will be rebuilt according to the standards of this rebuilt blast furnace. It is estimated that after all six blast furnaces in the factory are rebuilt to be automated, they will be able to produce more than 36,000 tons of pig iron for the country every year.

    马鞍山铁厂第一座自动化小型高炉投入生产
    新华社合肥27日电　马鞍山铁厂改建的第一座自动化小型炼铁高炉在最近投入生产。
    这座高炉原来有效容积小，附属设备——热风炉、鼓风机的潜力都不能充分发挥。经过这次改建，炉缸比原来适当地扩大和加高了，并且按照近代化大高炉式样增加了炉腰和炉喉。这样，每年就可以比原来增产六千多吨生铁。
    这座高炉的整个上料系统，除去卷扬机还要人工开关以外，全部都是自动化。炉顶上安装了近代化的自动炉顶旋转布料器，采用了马鞍山铁厂劳动模范张德宝试制成功的高炉大、小盖自动装置和自动记录器、自动探料杆，在卷扬房内设有信号箱。有了这套自动化的装备，不仅能使装料均匀，多出生铁，并且可以改善工人的劳动条件。过去堵铁口，工人要冒着炉火高温推着泥枪去堵。现在，只要按着开关，泥枪就自动把火花四射的铁口堵住。
    马鞍山铁厂还有五座高炉，也将按照这座改建成的高炉的标准进行改建。预计这个厂的六座高炉全部改建成自动化的以后，每年能为国家增产三万六千多吨生铁。
