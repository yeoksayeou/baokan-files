Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 17th dispatch from Antara News Agency, Surabaya: When warships participating in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military exercises come to anchor in ports such as East Java, Nusa Tenggara, and Kalimantan, Indonesian port and dock workers are preparing to implement a boycott. The local executive committees of the port and dock workers unions in these places issued a statement, believing that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's exercises are a threat to world peace and a violation and insult to Indonesian sovereignty.
According to the Jakarta "People's Daily", many members of parliament have also fiercely criticized the exercises conducted by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, pointing out that according to the new international rules regarding the high seas, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries should request Indonesia's permission before conducting exercises in the Java Sea—which is within Indonesia's territorial waters.

    抗议马尼拉集团在爪哇海演习
    据新华社雅加达电　安塔拉通讯社17日从泗水报道，在参加东南亚条约组织军事演习的军舰到东爪哇、努沙登加拉和加里曼丹等港口来停泊的时候，印度尼西亚的港口和码头工人准备实行抵制。这些地方的港口和码头工人工会地方执行委员会发表声明，它们认为东南亚条约组织的演习是对世界和平的威胁和对印度尼西亚主权的侵犯和侮辱。
    另据雅加达“人民日报”报道，国会议员多人也激烈地抨击东南亚条约组织进行的演习，他们指出，根据有关公海的新的国际规则，东南亚条约组织国家在爪哇海——它在印度尼西亚的领海内——举行演习以前应该请求印度尼西亚的准许。
