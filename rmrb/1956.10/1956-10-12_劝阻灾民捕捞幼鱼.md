    Persuade Disaster Victims to Stop Catching Juvenile Fish
    This year, some areas of Heilongjiang Province have suffered from disasters. To help themselves through production, the people in the disaster areas are generally catching juvenile fish along the rivers. From September 13th to 23rd, the Liaoyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yaobao Township, Hulan County, used dams to release water and fine-mesh nets to intercept more than 180,000 jin of juvenile fish. The Jianguo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wanbao Township, Zhaodong County, blocked a large bay with an earthen dike and caught 60,000 jin of juvenile fish in six days. In parts of five cities and counties—Zhaoyuan, Harbin, Hulan, Mishan, and Suihua—the number of fishing earthen dikes that could be counted reached 315. It is estimated that counties along the rivers throughout the province are catching more than 350,000 jin of juvenile fish every day. These juvenile fish range from 20 per jin for the larger ones to over 100 per jin for the smaller ones. If we calculate at 20 fish per jin, the juvenile fish caught in 20 days, if raised for a year, would be equivalent to the total output of Heilongjiang Province for two years. Continuing this fishing will make it impossible to sustain reserve aquatic resources, which will seriously affect the supply of fresh fish to the market in the future.
    These caught juvenile fish are only worth a few cents per jin and are not welcomed by the market. Many small fish end up rotting and being used as fertilizer, which does not greatly benefit the disaster victims. I suggest that the leading organs in the counties along the rivers in Heilongjiang Province should persuade the disaster victims to stop catching small fish and lead them to develop other sideline productions.　Qi Jiayan, Yu Qing

    劝阻灾民捕捞幼鱼
    今年黑龙江省有部分地区受灾，灾区人民为了生产自救，普遍地在沿江沿河地区捕捞幼鱼。呼兰县窑堡乡辽源农业生产合作社从9月13日到23日的十天中，利用堤坝放水、密眼网截堵幼鱼18万多斤；肇东县万宝乡建国农业生产合作社在附近大湾泡挡一道土?子，在六天中捕捞了六万斤幼鱼。肇源、哈尔滨、呼兰、密山、绥化五个市、县的部分区乡有数可查的捕鱼土?子达到三百十五处，估计全省沿江各县每天捕捞幼鱼三十五万斤以上。这些幼鱼大的二十条一斤，小的百余条一斤。如按二十条一斤计算，二十天捕捞的幼鱼放养一年、就等于黑龙江全省二年的产量。这样继续捕捞将使后备水产资源无法持续，严重影响今后市场鲜鱼的供应。
    这些捕捞的幼鱼每斤价值只有几分钱，也不受市场欢迎，许多小鱼结果腐烂沤粪，对灾民补益不大。我建议黑龙江省沿江各县领导机关要劝阻灾民捕捞小鱼，领导他们开展其他副业生产。　齐家燕、宇清
