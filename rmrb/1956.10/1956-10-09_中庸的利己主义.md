Mediocre Egoism
Ma Tieding

Lu Xun once fiercely opposed the doctrine of the mean, regarding it as a poison in our ancient civilization. We can still remember how Lu Xun's actions encouraged people's courage to reform and broke through the barriers of conservatism of that era.

Revolutionary spirit and the doctrine of the mean are incompatible. The great revolutionary storm of the twenties and thirties finally swept away the miasma of mediocrity. Today, it seems that everyone is unwilling to even mention this term, and younger people are especially unfamiliar with it. However, if you think about it carefully, just as the excellent traditions in our ancient civilization will not be eroded, the doctrine of the mean has not been completely swept away. It just attaches itself to other things, adopts another form of expression, and reaches another degree.

If you don't believe me, listen to the following arguments:

	Don't be too active or too passive. Being too active is easy to make mistakes and attract jealousy; being too passive means you can't get promoted and things will be done badly. So, neither do things well, nor do things badly. Just so-so, sloppily, cope with things, and take an extremely safe path.

Take the middle ground between two opposing opinions. Oppose one side, fearing to offend people, even risking losing appropriateness; support one side, appearing too unoriginal, and losing face. "You are right," "he is right," and most importantly, "I am right," so everyone is happy.

	Don't be too self-critical, nor not self-critical at all. Too much self-criticism damages prestige; no self-criticism makes it impossible to step down and prevents work from improving. Therefore, superficial and painless self-criticism appears; self-criticism with high "hats" and empty content appears; evasive and light-touch self-criticism appears....

And so on.

In fact, these various forms of the doctrine of the mean do have their mediocre purposes: neither harming others nor harming oneself, neither failing the people nor failing oneself. In a sense, this is not wrong. Unfortunately, this doctrine of the mean actually places oneself above others and the people, with oneself being the first to be valued. Therefore, one cannot help but intentionally or unintentionally have a certain degree of "harming others to benefit oneself," so the core of the doctrine of the mean becomes egoism. Fortunately, it has not yet reached the extreme, so it can be considered mediocre egoism. But, since it is egoism, that little bit of "grateful" "mediocrity" may not last long.

Moreover, the harm of the doctrine of the mean is anything but "mediocre"! How much courage for reform has it suppressed, and how many conservative barriers has it built!

    中庸的利己主义
    马铁丁
    鲁迅曾经激烈地反对过中庸之道，把它看做我们古老文明中的一种毒剂。我们至今还能够记得，鲁迅这种举动，曾怎样地鼓舞了人们的改革的勇气，冲开了那时代保守的藩篱。
    革命精神和中庸之道是势不两立的。二三十年的大革命风暴，总算扫除了那种中庸的妖氛。时至今日，大家好像连这个说法都不愿意提起了，年青一点的人对它格外生疏。但是，如果仔细想来，正如我们的古老文明中的优秀传统不会消蚀一样，中庸之道也不见得就一扫而光，只不过附着在另一些身上采用另一种表现形式，达到另一种程度而已。
    不信，请听以下的论调：
    既不要太积极，也不要太消极。太积极易犯错误，易招人忌；太消极，自己不能升级，事情也要做坏。于是，既不把事情做好，也不把事情做坏。平平复复，马马虎虎，对付对付，走一种极稳妥的路。
    两种相反的意见取其中。反对一方，生怕得罪人，甚至有失去适度的危险；赞成一方，显得自己太无创见，面子也不好看。“你也对”，“他也对”，最重要的“我也对”，于是皆大欢喜。
    既不要太自我批评，也不要不自我批评。太自我批评，有损威信；不自我批评，又不得下台，工作也不能改进。于是，轻敲碎打，不关痛痒的自我批评出现了；高戴“帽子”、空无内容的自我批评出现了；躲躲闪闪、避重就轻的自我批评出现了……。
    如此等等。
    说来，这种形形色色的中庸之道，也确有其中庸主义的目的：既无损于人，也无损于己，既不有负于人民，也不有负于自己。这在某种意义上也是不差的。不幸的是：这种中庸之道事实上是自己驾于别人、人民之上，第一个被看重的是自己。因之，就不能不有意无意地有一定程度的“损人利己”了，于是，中庸之道的骨子里便成了利己主义。好在这时还没有达于极端，可算得是中庸的利己主义。但，既然是利己主义，剩下那一点“令人感激”的“中庸”，也怕不会长远了。
    况且，中庸之道的为害，又何曾“中庸”！它，抑止了多少改革的勇气，筑了多少保守的藩篱！
