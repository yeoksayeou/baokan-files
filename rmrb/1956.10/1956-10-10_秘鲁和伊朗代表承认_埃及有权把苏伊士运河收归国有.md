Xinhua News Agency, New York, 9th - According to TASS, New York, on October 8th, at the afternoon meeting of the Security Council discussing the Suez issue, the representatives of Peru, Iran, Australia, Cuba, Belgium and the Chiang Kai-shek clique made statements.

    Peruvian representative Belaúnde said that he reserved the right to speak later on the substantive aspects of the Suez issue. He then spoke about the legal aspects of the issue. Despite some reservations, he acknowledged that the right of nationalization is part of sovereignty. He said that this indisputable principle is particularly important for Latin American countries, as they are currently encountering nationalization issues as well. Belaúnde asked the members of the Security Council not to delay negotiations and to conduct negotiations "in good faith."

    Iranian representative Abdoh hoped that the presence of the foreign ministers of the main relevant countries and their direct contact would provide a possibility for a peaceful resolution of the Suez issue. Abdoh said that the Iranian government does not deny Egypt's sovereign right to nationalize the Suez Canal. He said that the primary task of the Security Council should be to facilitate close contact between the parties concerned to seek a basis for agreement. Abdoh opposed discussing the Anglo-French draft resolution "at the present stage."

    He believes that if an agreement is reached on the basic principles of the agreement, then there is no need to vote on the Anglo-French draft resolution. The Iranian representative finally said that he does not object to Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov's proposal to establish a negotiating committee.

    Australian representative Walker supported the positions of Britain and France. Like the representatives of Britain and France, he attempted to deny Egypt's right to nationalize the Suez Canal.

    The representatives of Cuba and Belgium also supported the positions of Britain and France.

    The representatives of Peru, Iran and Australia supported the suggestion that the Security Council hold a closed meeting after the general discussion.

    秘鲁和伊朗代表承认
    埃及有权把苏伊士运河收归国有
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社纽约9日讯：在安全理事会10月8日下午会议上讨论苏伊士问题时发言的有秘鲁、伊朗、澳大利亚、古巴、比利时等国的代表和蒋介石分子。
    秘鲁代表贝朗德说，他保留以后在苏伊士问题的实质方面发言的权利。他接着谈到了问题的法律方面。尽管作了某些保留，他还是承认，国有化权利是主权的一部分。他说，这个无可争辩的原则对拉丁美洲国家说来尤其重要，因为它们目前也碰到了国有化问题。贝朗德要求安全理事会的理事们不要拖延谈判，要“本着诚意”进行谈判。
    伊朗代表阿卜杜希望主要有关国家的外交部长的出席和他们之间的直接接触能为苏伊士问题的和平解决提供可能性。阿卜杜说，伊朗政府不否认埃及把苏伊士运河收归国有的主权权利。他说，安理会的首要任务应当是促成有关方面的紧密接触，以寻求协议基础。阿卜杜反对“在目前阶段”讨论英法的决议草案。
    他认为，如果就协定的基本原则达成协议，那就没有必要就法英决议草案进行表决了。伊朗代表最后说，他不反对苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫关于建立谈判委员会的建议。
    澳大利亚代表沃克支持英法两国的立场。他像英法两国代表一样，企图否认埃及把苏伊士运河收归国有的权利。
    古巴和比利时的代表也支持英法两国的立场。
    秘鲁、伊朗和澳大利亚的代表支持这样的建议：在一般性讨论结束之后，安全理事会举行秘密会议。
