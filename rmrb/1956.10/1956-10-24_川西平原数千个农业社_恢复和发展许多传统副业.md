Xinhua News Agency Report: Thousands of agricultural cooperatives on the Western Sichuan Plain have recently restored and developed many traditional sideline occupations that had been interrupted for many years.

In the villages of some counties near Chengdu, a large number of women are now engaged in embroidery work. In Xipu Township, Pixian County alone, there are as many as 452 people. This sideline occupation had been interrupted for four or five years due to a shortage of raw materials. Now that the raw material supply problem has been solved, it has begun to develop again. A woman with an intermediate level of skill in this sideline can earn ten to thirty yuan per month, which is enough for the family's miscellaneous expenses.

The brick and tile industry, which had been in decline for more than ten years, has not only restored its original 200 or so kilns due to the rapid development of industrial construction in Chengdu and other cities, but has also expanded to more than 1,000 kilns. The agricultural cooperatives in Xinfan County alone have already earned more than 80,000 yuan from the sideline occupation of burning bricks and tiles. The transportation of a large number of bricks and tiles has also kept tens of thousands of handcarts and wheelbarrows busy on the plain.

The famous Chinese medicine, "Yujingzi," produced in the Jinma River basin of Shuangliu County, was originally an important sideline occupation for farmers in these areas. In previous years, due to inappropriate restrictions on planting, many places experienced shortages. Recently, the local government lifted these restrictions and allocated tens of thousands of catties of oil cake to agricultural cooperatives for the development of "Yujingzi" production. The agricultural cooperatives on both sides of the Jinma River have now used the open space after harvesting corn to plant 1,700 mu of "Yujingzi," more than double the highest previous year.

    川西平原数千个农业社
    恢复和发展许多传统副业
    据新华社讯　川西平原上的数千个农业合作社最近恢复和发展了许多中断多年的传统副业。
    在靠近成都市的一些县份的乡村中，现在有大批妇女从事刺绣工作，仅郫县犀浦一乡就有四百五十二人之多。这项副业曾因原料缺乏中断了四、五年，现在因为原料供应问题解决，才又开始发展起来。从事这种副业的一个具有中等技术水平的妇女，每月可以收入十元到三十元，足够一家人的零星开支。
    衰落已有十多年的砖瓦业，由于成都等城市工业建设的迅速发展，最近不仅原有的二百来个砖瓦窑已经恢复，而且已经发展到一千多个窑。仅新繁一县的农业社，就已经从烧砖瓦的副业上收入了八万多元。大批砖瓦的运输工作，也使平原上数以万计的架子车、鸡公车忙碌起来。
    著名的中药——双流县金马河流域出产的“玉京子”，本是这些地方农民的重要副业，前几年由于不适当的限制种植，很多地方发生脱销。最近，当地政府取消了这种限制，又拨出了十数万斤油饼给农业社作发展“玉京子”生产之用。现在金马河两岸的农业社已利用收获玉米以后的空地种植“玉京子”一千七百亩，比过去最高年度还多一倍。
