Xinhua News Agency, October 28th, New York dispatch: The United States, Britain, and France demanded on the 27th that the Security Council hold an emergency meeting today to discuss the situation in Hungary.

In a letter to the President of the Security Council for October, Gorny-Gentil (France), the three countries' representatives described the actions of Soviet troops, at the request of the Hungarian government and in accordance with the Warsaw Treaty, to help it quell the riots as "suppressing the rights of the Hungarian people."

US State Department spokesman White said on October 27 that Hungary had declared to the US State Department that the actions of Soviet troops in suppressing the rebellion in Hungary were "completely legal under the Warsaw Treaty."

According to White, this statement was conveyed to US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Murphy by the First Secretary of the Hungarian Embassy in the US, Tibor Zador, during a visit to Murphy. Zador also told Murphy that the United Nations had "no reason" to review the Hungarian situation.

Reports say the Security Council is scheduled to meet at 9:00 PM Greenwich time today to discuss the three-country proposal.

    匈驻美使馆通知美国务院说联合国无权讨论
    新华社28日讯　纽约消息：美、英、法三国27日要求安全理事会在今天召开紧急会议讨论匈牙利的局势。
    三国代表在给安理会10月份主席戈尔尼—让蒂（法国）的一封信里把苏联军队应匈牙利政府请求、根据华沙条约帮助它平服暴乱的行动说成是“压制匈牙利人民的权利”。
    美国国务院发言人怀特10月27日说，匈牙利已经向美国国务院声明苏联军队在匈牙利镇压叛乱的行动“根据华沙条约是完全合法的”。
    据怀特说，这项声明是匈牙利驻美使馆一等秘书集鲍尔·查多尔访问美国副国务卿帮办墨菲的时候通知墨菲的。查多尔还对墨菲说，联合国“没有理由”来审查匈牙利局势。
    消息说，安理会定于今天格林威治时间二十一时开会讨论三国提案。
