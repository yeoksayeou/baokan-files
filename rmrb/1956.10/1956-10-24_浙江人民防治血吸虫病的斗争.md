    The Struggle of the People of Zhejiang to Prevent and Control Schistosomiasis
    Tu Zhengfeng
    Zhejiang is a key area for schistosomiasis prevention and control work in the country. More than 1.5 million people in the province suffer from schistosomiasis, and more than 10 million people are directly threatened by this disease. In areas where schistosomiasis is severe, fields are barren, and the population is gradually decreasing. The people of Zhejiang have been threatened by this disease not only in a wide area but also for a long time. In 1951, according to past data and investigations in more than 40 cities and counties, including Zhuji, Kaihua, Changhua, Qu County, and Jiaxing, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Health found that schistosomiasis has been prevalent in Zhejiang for more than 300 years.
    For hundreds of years, the spread of schistosomiasis has threatened more than 50% of the people in the province. In order to protect people's health, Zhejiang Province began to carry out schistosomiasis prevention and control work in 1950. Schistosomiasis prevention and control stations were established in Jiaxing, Quzhou, and Shaoxing, and twenty-three county-level prevention and control stations and forty prevention and control groups were established in the past six years. Now, the province has comprehensively launched a mass movement for schistosomiasis prevention and control.
    In the struggle to prevent and control schistosomiasis, Zhejiang Province has adopted comprehensive prevention and control measures that combine prevention and treatment, including eliminating the intermediate host of schistosomiasis—Oncomelania hupensis snails—as well as managing feces and protecting water sources. This year, the province's health departments and organizations such as the Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation organized 2,000 shock teams to eliminate and investigate snails, with 540,000 people participating in this shock snail elimination campaign. Various localities have also trained more than 40,000 agricultural cooperative health workers and sanitation backbones (the task of training 70,000 people will be completed this year), and at the same time, have provided technical guidance to the masses on eliminating snails, managing feces, and protecting water sources. In the past six months, more than 1,200 kilograms of snails have been captured in the province, and snails have been buried in more than 12.8 million square meters of land, exceeding six times the snail elimination achievements of the past six years. The masses have created many new methods in snail investigation, snail elimination, and fecal and water source management. Jiaxing, Jinhua, Changshan and other cities and counties have divided areas by township or natural village, with dedicated personnel responsible for investigating the distribution of snails in rivers, streams, ponds, wasteland, depressions, and paddy fields within the designated areas, inserting bamboo signs to mark them, and drawing up river snail elimination work plans or simple snail distribution diagrams to mobilize forces to eliminate them. Various localities also adopt various methods to eliminate snails according to local conditions. For example, in large plain areas, in paddy fields, new ditches are dug and abandoned ditches are filled in combination with the renovation of irrigation ditches for soil burial; wasteland and depressions are combined with land reclamation for soil burial; paddy dikes are combined with pest control for soil burial; ditches next to highways are used to shovel up the mud blocks with snails and fill in the low-lying areas of the highway in combination with road repair; river banks, steep ground or ground with many bricks and tiles where soil burial cannot be used to eliminate snails, use hot water to scald and dry grass to burn the snails to death; use branches, bamboo tips and other physical objects to lure snails and manually catch and kill snails according to the habits of snails; shovel up the snails and mud and grass and burn them into coke mud ash or make them into compost to suffocate the snails; some areas also use tea seed cake, Croton tiglium, Datura stramonium, calcium arsenate, 666 and other drugs in combination with pest control to poison and kill snails; on the banks of stone rivers, ponds, and lakes, combined with water conservancy construction, use cement, lime, etc. to fill in stone crevices to eliminate snails. In these areas, the density of snail distribution has been reduced to varying degrees, and some rivers and ditches can no longer find snails.
    Managing feces and protecting water sources is an important part of blocking the transmission route of schistosomiasis. At present, the dung tanks in the schistosomiasis epidemic areas of Zhejiang are mostly concentrated and covered with shade, and clear water tanks are set up next to the dung tanks to wash manure tools and protect the cleanliness of water sources. In order to maintain the cleanliness of water use, in addition to dividing ponds for water use and establishing management water source covenants among the masses, various localities have also carried out the construction of water wells and the search for mountain spring water sources.
    In terms of the treatment of schistosomiasis, in the past five years from 1951 to the present, nearly 40,000 schistosomiasis patients in the province have recovered their health through effective treatment. This year, the province will complete the treatment task of 150,000 people. At present, medical institutions at all levels in the province have designated a certain number of beds specifically for admitting schistosomiasis patients, and have transferred more than 2,000 Chinese and Western medical personnel to form 180 treatment groups to treat schistosomiasis patients in various epidemic areas. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Health has also established specialized hospitals for the treatment of schistosomiasis patients in Hangzhou, Jinhua, Jiaxing and other places to accommodate schistosomiasis patients. In the treatment work, medical staff from various places go deep into rural areas to treat patients stationed in cooperatives in order to facilitate farmers. Shangyu County established mobile hospitals to tour rural areas for treatment. The drugs and treatment methods used in the treatment include Western medicine antimony agents, traditional Chinese medicine Ascella dipyrena, compound insecticide pills, etc.; there are antimony agent three-day therapy and acupuncture therapy that combine traditional Chinese and Western medicine to improve the treatment method. Jinhua, Hangzhou, Qu County, Changxing and other eight cities and counties have treated more than 1,000 people with three-day therapy. Hangzhou City used short-term therapies and rapid therapies such as antimony agent three-day, six-day, and seven-day therapies to treat more than 200 patients. The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Medical College studied antimony detoxification drugs and used methionine as a detoxification agent for clinical application from April, and preliminary results have been obtained. This year, Zhejiang Traditional Chinese Medicine publicly announced 105 effective prescriptions and single prescriptions that can treat schistosomiasis. Among them, Ascella dipyrena, Selaginella, compound insecticide pills, and Jinhuang pills and other 17 kinds of Chinese medicines have been applied clinically, and have significant effects on relieving symptoms and restoring health for patients with late-stage ascites. The compound insecticide pill composed of Dianthus chinensis, Omphalotus japonicus, Pulsatilla chinensis and other ten kinds of Chinese medicines, according to the observation of more than 100 cases treated by the Hangzhou Municipal Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic and the Municipal Third Hospital, its insecticidal effect reaches more than 40%. In order to strengthen the research work on schistosomiasis prevention and control, Zhejiang Province established a Scientific Research Committee for Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control. In addition to continuing to strengthen the research work on existing therapies and drugs, and promote them after summary and technical appraisal, it will also carry out mass scientific research work to expand the research scope of schistosomiasis treatment drugs. In terms of snail elimination, fecal management, water source protection and personal prevention, the Scientific Research Committee for Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control will widely collect effective methods and drugs used by the masses for scientific research and appraisal, and promote them in various places.

    浙江人民防治血吸虫病的斗争
    屠正峰
    浙江是全国防治血吸虫病工作的重点地区。全省有一百五十多万人患血吸虫病，约有一千多万人直接受到这种病害的威胁。血吸虫病危害严重的地区，田园荒芜，人口渐渐减少。浙江人民受这种病害的威胁不仅地区广，而且年代也久。1951年浙江省卫生厅根据过去的资料和诸暨、开化、昌化、衢县、嘉兴等四十多市、县的调查，血吸虫病在浙江流行已有三百多年。
    几百年来，由于血吸虫病的蔓延，使占全省50％以上的人民都受到了血吸虫病的威胁。为了保障人民的健康，浙江省在1950年就开始进行防治血吸虫病的工作，在嘉兴、衢州、绍兴三个地区分别成立了血吸虫病防治所，六年来成立了二十三个县防治站和四十个防治组。现在全省已全面地开展了群众性的防治血吸虫病运动。
    浙江省在防治血吸虫病的斗争中，采取预防和治疗结合的综合性防治措施，进行消灭血吸虫的中间宿主——钉螺蛳，以及管理粪便和保护水源等工作。今年全省的卫生部门和青年团、妇联等单位组织了二千个灭螺、查螺突击队，有五十四万人投入这个突击灭螺运动。各地还训练了四万多个农业社的保健员和卫生骨干（今年将完成七万人的训练任务），同时对群众进行消灭钉螺、管理粪便、保护水源的技术指导工作。半年来全省已捕钉螺一千二百多斤，在一千二百八十多万平方公尺的地区对钉螺进行了土埋，超过了六年来灭螺成绩的六倍。群众在查螺、灭螺和粪便、水源管理工作中创造了许多新的办法，嘉兴、金华、常山等市、县，均按乡、镇或以自然村为单位划分区域由专人负责，在所划区域的范围内调查河流、溪沟、塘水、荒田、洼地、田畈的钉螺分布情况，扦插竹牌标明，制出河流灭螺工作规划图或简单的钉螺分布示意图，发动力量进行扑灭。各地还根据当地情况采用各种方法消灭钉螺。譬如大片平原地区，在水稻田畈内，结合整修灌溉沟渠的工作开新沟、填废沟进行土埋；在荒田、洼地结合开荒的工作进行土埋；在田塍旁边结合治虫工作进行土埋；靠公路旁边的水沟则将有钉螺的泥块铲起，结合修路，填铺公路洼地；在不能用土埋方法灭螺的河岸、陡的地面或砖瓦乱石多的地面，则用热水烫、干草烧死钉螺；根据钉螺的习性用树枝、竹梢等实物诱螺和人工捕捉杀灭钉螺；把钉螺和泥草铲起烧成焦泥灰或做成堆肥使钉螺闷死；有的地区还结合除虫用茶子饼、土巴豆、闹洋花以及砒酸钙、六六六等药物来毒杀钉螺；在石砌的河、塘、湖沼岸边结合兴修水利，用水泥、石灰等填嵌石缝消灭钉螺。在这些地区，钉螺分布的密度均有不同程度的降低，有的河沟已找不着钉螺。
    管好粪便和保护好水源是堵塞血吸虫病传染途径的一个重要环节。现在浙江血吸虫病流行地区的粪缸大部分地集中，并加荫加盖，同时在粪缸边设清水缸来洗刷粪具，保护水源清洁。为保持用水的清洁，各地除了分塘用水、在群众中订立管理水源公约以外，还进行了修建水井、寻找山泉水源的工作。
    在血吸虫病的治疗工作方面，从1951年到现在五年来，全省将近四万个血吸虫病人在有效的治疗中恢复了健康。今年全省将完成十五万人的治疗任务。现在全省各级医疗机构已划出一定的病床专供收容血吸虫病人，抽调了二千多名中西医务人员组成了一百八十个治疗组，在各流行地区巡回治疗血吸虫病人。浙江省卫生厅还在杭州、金华、嘉兴等地专设了治疗血吸虫病人的专科医院，收容血吸虫病人。各地医务人员在治疗工作中，为了便利农民，就深入农村驻社治疗。上虞县设立流动医院到农村巡回治疗。在治疗中所采用的药物和治疗方法，有西药锑剂、中药腹水草、复方杀虫丸等；有中西药结合改进疗法的锑剂三日疗法和针灸疗法。金华、杭州、衢县、长兴等八个市、县采用三日疗法已治好一千多人。杭州市运用锑剂三日、六日、七日等短程疗法和快速疗法治疗了二百多病人。浙江医学院附属第一医院研究锑剂解毒的药物，利用甲硫氨基酸为解毒剂从四月份起应用于临床，已有初步结果。今年浙江中医公开了一百零五种可以治疗血吸虫病的验方和单方，其中浮胀草、岩柏草、复方杀虫丸、金黄丸等十七种中药已应用于临床，对晚期腹水病人减轻症状、恢复健康有显著效果。由矍麦、雷丸、白头翁等十种中药配合起来的复方杀虫丸，据杭州市中医门诊部、市立第三医院一百多个病例治疗后的观察，其杀虫效果达40％以上。为了加强防治血吸虫病的研究工作，浙江省成立了血吸虫病防治科学研究委员会，除了继续加强对已有疗法、药物进行研究工作，并经过总结和技术鉴定后加以推广外，还将展开群众性的科学研究工作，扩大治疗血吸虫病药物的研究范围。在灭螺、管理粪便、保护水源和个人预防方面，血吸虫病防治科学研究委员会将广泛收集群众中应用有效的办法和药物等加以科学的研究和鉴定，在各地加以推广。
