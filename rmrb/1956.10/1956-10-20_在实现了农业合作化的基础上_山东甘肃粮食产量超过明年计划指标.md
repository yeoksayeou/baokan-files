    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 18th. The harvesting of grain crops in Shandong Province, with the exception of sweet potatoes and other crops, has largely concluded. According to estimates from the Provincial Department of Agriculture based on typical surveys and reports from various regions, this year's total grain output will reach 31.4 billion jin, an increase of 16.2% compared to 1955, the year with the highest grain output, and exceeding the planned target of 28.5 billion jin stipulated for the final year of the First Five-Year Plan.

    This year, in Shandong Province, due to the expansion of the planting area of cash crops such as cotton and peanuts, the planting area of grain crops decreased by more than 3.18 million mu compared to last year. In order to strive for a good grain harvest despite the reduction in planting area, agricultural cooperatives in various regions carried out a series of preparations to increase the yield per unit area as early as last winter. In water conservancy alone, in the eight months or so since October of last year, by drilling wells and constructing small-scale irrigation projects such as ponds and reservoirs, more than 24.4 million mu of dry land throughout the province has been transformed into irrigated land, an increase of nearly three times the original total amount of irrigated land. This irrigated land has played a significant role in ensuring the increased production of wheat and early autumn crops.

    At the time of sowing, agricultural cooperatives in various regions increased the planting of high-yield crops according to local conditions. The planting area of high-yield crops such as sweet potatoes and corn increased by more than 7.3 million mu compared to last year. At the same time, agricultural cooperatives in various regions also carried out some farming reforms according to local conditions, such as intercropping, overlapping cropping, and changing from a three-crop system in two years to a two-crop system in one year, greatly increasing the multiple cropping area and increasing yields.

    During the crop growth period, the agricultural cooperatives generally did a more timely and careful job of field cultivation, weeding, fertilization, and pest control than in previous years, which also created conditions for increasing grain production this year.

    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 19th. Gansu Province has achieved a bumper harvest of grain crops this year. According to estimates from the Gansu Provincial Bureau of Statistics, the total grain output of the province this year will reach 11.7 billion jin, an increase of 49% compared to last year, exceeding the target of the First Five-Year Plan by 3.377 billion jin.

    Gansu Province has achieved an all-round bumper harvest of rice, wheat, soybeans, and miscellaneous grains this year. Not only did the large irrigation areas of the Hexi Corridor, the Yellow River Plain in the north, and the Bailong River basin with sufficient rainfall achieve bumper harvests, but also the hilly and plateau areas in the central and eastern parts, which have always been relatively arid and with little rainfall, also achieved bumper harvests.

    At present, farmers throughout the province are working hard on the autumn harvest. The autumn harvest in the Yellow River Plain in the north and the Bailong River basin in the south has ended, and the harvest in other regions has also been largely completed.

    Gansu's bumper harvest of grain crops this year was achieved on the basis of basically realizing agricultural cooperativization. After agricultural cooperativization this spring, agricultural cooperatives in various regions, according to the characteristics of Gansu being mountainous and prone to drought, vigorously built farmland water conservancy projects. By the end of August, the increased irrigation area in the province reached more than 4.3 million mu, about half of the original irrigated area. The amount of fertilizer applied to farmland was also generally increased by 30% compared to last year, and the farming techniques were also more meticulous and timely than in previous years. Most of the more than 2.22 million mu of wasteland reclaimed this year was also planted with grain crops in a timely manner.

    The relatively timely rainfall this year is also one of the main reasons why Gansu Province has achieved a bumper harvest of grain crops.

    在实现了农业合作化的基础上
    山东甘肃粮食产量超过明年计划指标
    新华社济南18日电　山东省的粮食作物收获工作，目前除了甘薯等作物以外，已经大体结束。省农业厅根据典型调查和各地汇报的情况估计，今年粮食总产量将达到三百一十四亿斤，比产粮最多的1955年要增产16.2％，并且超过了第一个五年计划最后一年规定的粮食产量二百八十五亿斤的计划指标。
    今年，山东省由于棉花、花生等经济作物种植面积的扩大，粮食作物的种植面积比去年减少了三百一十八万多亩。为了争取在种植面积减少的情况下不少收粮食，早在去年冬季各地农业社就进行了一系列的提高单位面积产量的准备工作。仅水利一项，从去年10月份以后的八个多月中，通过打井和修建塘坝、水库等小型灌溉工程，已经使全省两千四百多万亩旱田变成了水浇地，比原有水浇地总数增加近三倍。这些水浇地对保证小麦和早秋作物的增产，起了很大作用。
    在播种的时候，各地农业社都因地制宜地增种了不少高产作物。甘薯、玉米等高产作物的种植面积比去年扩大了七百三十多万亩。同时，各地农业社还根据当地情况，进行一些耕作改革。如间作、套作、变两年三作为一年两作等，大大增多了复种面积，提高了产量。
    在作物生长期间，各农业社对农田中耕锄草、追肥和治虫等管理工作，一般都比往年作得及时、细致，这也为今年增产粮食创造了条件。
    新华社兰州19日电　甘肃省今年粮食作物大丰收，据甘肃省统计局估计，今年全省粮食总产量将达到一百十七亿斤，比去年增产49％，超过第一个五年计划指标三十三亿七千七百多万斤。
    甘肃省今年粮食作物水稻、小麦、大豆和杂粮全面丰收。不仅大型灌溉区河西走廊、北部黄河平原以及雨量充足的白龙江流域获得丰收，而且历来比较干旱少雨的中东部丘陵与高原地带也获得了丰收。
    目前，全省农民正在紧张进行秋收工作，北部黄河平原、南部白龙江流域的秋收已经结束，其余地区也已经收割了大半。
    甘肃今年粮食作物的丰收，是在基本上实现农业合作化的基础上获得的。今春农业合作化以后，各地农业社根据甘肃多山容易发生干旱的特点，大力地兴修了农田水利工程，到8月底全省增加的灌溉面积达四百三十多万亩，约等于原有水地的一半。农田的施肥量，一般的也比去年增加30％，耕作技术也较往年细致，而且耕作及时。今年开垦的二百二十二万多亩荒地，也大部分及时地种上了粮食作物。
    今年雨水比较适时，也是甘肃省粮食作物获得丰收的主要原因之一。
