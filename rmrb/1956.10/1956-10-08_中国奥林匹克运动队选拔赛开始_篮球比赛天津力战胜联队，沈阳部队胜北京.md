The selection trials for the Chinese team to participate in the 16th Olympic Games commenced with an opening ceremony at the Beijing Gymnasium on the evening of the 7th. Over 400 outstanding athletes from 27 provinces, cities, autonomous regions, Hong Kong and Macau marched into the venue in neat formation. Among the athletes are many familiar faces, such as Chen Jingkai, China's first world record-breaking weightlifter; Mu Xiangxiong, the swimmer with remarkable achievements in international competitions; gymnastics stars Bao Naijian and Chen Xiaozhang; well-known team members, as well as Hong Kong and Macau's leading football, basketball, gymnastics players, and champions in track and field, swimming, and weightlifting. They will all report their achievements to the people of the motherland through this selection trial and strive to go to Melbourne to participate in the 16th Olympic Games.

Cai Shufan, Director of the Preparatory Committee for China's Participation in the 16th Olympic Games, spoke at the opening ceremony. He hoped that the athletes would not be arrogant in victory or discouraged in defeat, and that they would further improve their technical level and create new records through this selection competition, so as to win honor for the motherland at the 16th Olympic Games.

Two basketball games were held after the opening ceremony. Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai attended the games and, after the games concluded, met with all members of the sports delegations from Hong Kong and Macau on the court and cordially shook hands with them one by one.

This newspaper reports that the basketball competition of the selection trials for the Chinese team to participate in the 16th Olympic Games began yesterday evening after the opening ceremony of the selection trials. Two games were held. In the first game, Tianjin team defeated the Combined Team 87-86; in the second game, Shenyang Military Region team defeated Beijing team 87-67.

In the first game between the Combined Team and Tianjin, both sides adopted fast-break tactics and active man-to-man defense. At the beginning of the game, Tianjin team scored continuously with shots and free throws, leading by seven points with a score of 13-6. The Combined Team quickly caught up, with Zhang Xishan repeatedly cutting into the basket to score, and Yang Boyong also using feints to lure away the opponent's guards and then quickly flashing up for a layup. Wonderful moments appeared continuously on the court. Tianjin team defended very tightly, with the five players cooperating closely. Several fast breaks were very successful, and mid-range shots were also very accurate, keeping the score in the lead. The first half ended 47-42.

After changing sides, the Combined Team brought in Liu Erzhu, who was good at jumping and controlling the ball under the basket, and the situation on the court improved. Soon, they tied the score at 51-51. Later, they took the lead at 54-51. Instantly, Tianjin team exceeded again at 68-63.

With nine minutes left in the game, the Combined Team adopted a full-court press man-to-man defense. Tianjin team responded calmly, taking advantage of the Combined Team's eagerness to steal the ball, dodging the opponent's guards, cutting into the basket to score, and maintaining a lead of six or seven points.

With one and a half minutes left, the score was 87-80, with Tianjin team leading by seven points. At this time, the Combined Team's full-court press man-to-man tactics were very active. Qian Chenghai intercepted the ball three times midway, bringing it into the basket for a layup. The score on the court became 87-86. Finally, as the buzzer sounded, time ran out, and the Combined Team lost to Tianjin team by one point.

In the second game, Shenyang Military Region team played against Beijing team. Shenyang Military Region team was the champion team of last year's National Basketball League. The players are in good physical condition, fast, and good at fast breaks. In yesterday's game, they defeated the strong Beijing team because they successfully used fast-break tactics in conjunction with the "8" character cut. Beijing team's tactics were to spread out the formation and attack through the center, but due to inaccurate shooting and untimely retreat, and because they could not control the ball under the basket, they dared not shoot boldly and were often in a passive state. Shenyang Military Region team's guard Ma Qingsheng (No. 15) played very actively yesterday, dodging Beijing team's several defensive lines from the end line many times to cut into the basket and shoot. He scored a total of 33 points with free throws and shots.

    中国奥林匹克运动队选拔赛开始
    篮球比赛天津力战胜联队，沈阳部队胜北京
    本报讯　我国参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会运动队的选拔比赛大会，7日晚间在北京体育馆举行了开幕式。来自全国二十七个省、市、自治区和香港、澳门的四百多名优秀运动员，踏着整齐的步伐走入会场。在运动员队伍里面，有很多人是人们所熟悉的。像我国第一个创造世界纪录的举重运动员陈镜开，在国际比赛中成绩显著的游泳选手穆祥雄，体操运动健将鲍乃健、陈孝彰以及著名的球队队员们，另外还有香港、澳门的足、篮球、体操名将和田径、游泳、举重等的冠军。他们都要通过这次选拔赛向祖国人民汇报成绩，并争取到墨尔本去参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会。
    我国参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会筹备委员会主任蔡树藩在开幕式上讲话，他希望运动员们胜不骄，败不馁；通过这次选拔比赛，进一步提高技术水平，创造新纪录，以便在第十六届奥林匹克运动会上为祖国争取荣誉。
    开幕式后举行了两场篮球比赛。刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理到场观看了比赛，并在比赛终了后到球场上接见了香港和澳门体育代表队的全体人员，并且同他们一一亲切地握手。
    本报讯　我国参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会运动队选拔赛的篮球比赛，昨天晚间在选拔赛的开幕式后开始。共举行了两场比赛。第一场天津队以八十七比八十六胜联队；第二场沈阳部队队以八十七比六十七胜北京队。
    第一场联队对天津，双方都采取快攻战术，和积极主动的人盯人的防守方法。比赛一开始，天津队连投带罚，连连得分，比数到十三比六，领先七分。联队急起直追，张锡山接连切入篮下得分，杨伯镛也几次以假动作诱开对方的后卫，然后快速闪身上篮，球场上不断出现精彩的镜头。天津队防守得很严密，五个队员紧密合作，几次快攻都很成功，中距离投篮也非常准确，比分一直领先。上半时结束，四十七比四十二。
    易篮再战后，联队调入弹跳好，善于控制篮下球的刘二柱，场上情况果有好转，不久便追成五十一平。以后又以五十四比五十一一度领先。瞬间，天津队又以六十八比六十三超出。
    离比赛结束还有九分钟时，联队采用了全场紧迫人盯人的打法。天津队沉着应战，利用联队抢球心情过急的机会，闪过对方后卫，切入篮下得分，仍一直保持领先六、七分。
    到最后一分半钟时，场上比数为八十七比八十，天津队占先七分。这时联队的全场紧迫人盯人战术打得很活跃，钱澄海三次在半途截住来球，带入篮下托入。场上比数形成八十七比八十六。最后锣声一响，时间已到，联队以一分之差败于天津队。
    第二场比赛沈阳部队队对北京队。沈阳部队队是去年全国篮球联赛的冠军队。队员的体力好，速度快，善于打快攻。昨天的比赛，他们就是因为成功地运用了快攻战术配合“8”字切入，战胜了实力雄厚的北京队。北京队的打法是拉开阵地，通过中锋进攻，但是由于投篮不够准确和退守不及时，又因为不能控制篮下球，不敢大胆投篮，经常处于被动状态。沈阳部队队后卫马清盛（15号）昨天打得很活跃，多次从端线闪过北京队的几道防线切入篮下投球，他一个人连罚带投共得了三十三分。
