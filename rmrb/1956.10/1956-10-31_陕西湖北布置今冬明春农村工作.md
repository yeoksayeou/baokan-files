Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, October 29th: The Second District Committee Secretary Meeting convened by the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China closed on the 27th. The meeting conveyed the resolutions of the "Eighth National Congress," summarized the rural work since the first District Committee Secretary Meeting in the province last September, and arranged the work for this winter and next spring. While affirming the achievements in agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production, the meeting seriously conducted criticism and self-criticism, and examined and analyzed the shortcomings and errors in the rural work of Shaanxi Province.

The meeting decided that during the period from the autumn harvest to the end of the year, the province should complete the historical task of advanced agricultural cooperativization, and at the same time carry out the third phase of cooperative consolidation, winter production, and spring plowing preparations. In areas that have basically achieved advanced cooperativization, efforts should be concentrated on winter production and cooperative consolidation, while absorbing farmers who have not yet joined the cooperatives, appropriately merging cooperatives, and properly handling the issue of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who have abandoned their reactionary activities joining the cooperatives. In areas that have not yet achieved advanced cooperativization, efforts should be made to upgrade, expand, and merge elementary cooperatives in conjunction with cooperative consolidation and production within the year. Severely disaster-stricken areas should combine various tasks to do a good job in disaster relief, especially in making achievements in diversified operations and sideline production to compensate for the losses after the disaster.

During this winter's cooperative consolidation, the province's agricultural cooperatives will be led to launch a democratic discussion on running cooperatives to comprehensively summarize the experience of running cooperatives.

The meeting required all localities to vigorously develop diversified operations and sideline production in winter.

The meeting also criticized the blindly optimistic mood of some cadres regarding the agricultural cooperativization movement this winter.

The meeting called on Party organizations at all levels to resolutely implement the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, examine and summarize work, and learn the working methods of the mass line. It required local and county Party committees to send a large number of cadres to the countryside after the meeting to conduct investigations and research, and to establish this work as a system.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 27th: The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a joint meeting of prefectural committee secretaries. The meeting decided that in rural work this winter and next spring, work should be summarized, work styles rectified, plans revised, and leadership improved to strive for a greater harvest.

The meeting announced that Hubei Province has already overfulfilled the state's planned grain and cotton production targets for 1957 this year. The meeting stipulated that grain production will increase by about 7% next year, cotton production will increase by 10% to 15%, and total income, including sideline production, will increase by 15% to 20% on a county basis.

The meeting pointed out that the agricultural technology reform movement has been widely developed in the vast rural areas, more than 85% of cooperative members have increased their income, and all agricultural cooperatives have been consolidated. The meeting also examined and criticized subjectivism in the thinking of cadres, bureaucracy in work style, and sectarianism in organization.

The meeting pointed out that the entire Party must be educated to learn the working style of seeking truth from facts and the mass line. The best way to solve this problem is to rectify the Party's work style, revise production plans, and improve leadership by starting from summarizing work experience.

The meeting believed that in revising production plans, it is necessary to oppose both rash advances and conservatism, and the plan must be placed on a comprehensive, active, and reliable foundation. The meeting particularly emphasized that cooperatives should include the development of diversified operations and cooperative members' household sideline occupations in their plans.

    陕西湖北布置今冬明春农村工作
    据新华社西安29日电　中共陕西省委召开的第二次区委书记会议在27日闭幕。这次会议传达了“八大”的决议，并总结了自去年9月全省第一次区委书记会议以来的农村工作，布置了今冬明春的工作。会议在肯定农业合作化和农业生产成绩的同时，认真开展批评和自我批评，检查和分析了陕西省农村工作中的缺点和错误。
    会议决定在秋收后到年底这一时期内，全省要完成高级农业合作化的历史任务，同时进行第三期整社工作和冬季生产、春耕准备等工作。在已经基本实现高级合作化的地区，要集中力量进行冬季生产和整社工作，同时吸收尚未入社的农民入社，适当并社，处理好地主、富农和已经放弃反动活动的反革命分子的入社问题。尚未实现高级合作化的地区，争取年内结合整社和生产进行初级社升级、扩社、并社等工作。受灾严重地区要结合各项工作做好救灾工作，特别要在多种经营和副业生产上做出成绩，以弥补受灾后的损失。
    在今冬整社中，将领导全省农业社开展一次民主办社的大讨论，以全面总结办社经验。
    会议要求各地大力开展冬季的多种经营和副业生产。
    会议还批评了部分干部对今冬农业合作化运动的盲目乐观情绪。
    会议号召各级党组织坚决贯彻党的第八次全国代表大会的精神，检查总结工作，学习群众路线的工作方法。要求各地委、县委在会后抽出大量干部到农村去进行调查研究，并且把这项工作定为制度。
    据新华社武汉27日电　中共湖北省委员会最近召开了地委书记联席会议。会议决定今冬明春在农村工作中总结工作、整顿作风、修订规划、改进领导以争取更大的丰收。
    会议宣布，湖北省今年已经超额完成国家拟订的1957年粮棉生产指标。会议规定明年粮食增产7％左右，棉花增产10％至15％，总收入连副业生产在内以县为单位增加15％至20％。
    会议指出，农业技术改革运动在广大农村中得到了普遍发展，85％以上的社员增加了收入，所有的农业合作社都巩固下来了。会议同时检查和批评了干部思想上的主观主义，作风上的官僚主义和组织上的宗派主义。
    会议指出，必须教育全党学会实事求是和群众路线的工作作风。解决这个问题的最好办法就是从总结工作经验入手来整顿党的作风，修订生产规划和改进领导。
    会议认为，在修订生产规划中，既要反对冒进，也要反对保守，必须把规划放在全面、积极而又可靠的基础上。会议特别强调合作社要把开展多种经营和社员家庭副业放在规划之内。
