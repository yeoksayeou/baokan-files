    Zhou Wenhua: History of Ru Lan's Garden
    The old bookstores in Shanghai are clearing out their back stock. I heard that Xiuwentang had cleared out this book and eagerly sought to purchase it, but it had already been acquired by Laixunge from Beijing. After returning to Beijing, I obtained it from Laixunge. Among books on gardening, this is a relatively detailed and good book. It consists of twelve volumes, covering the lunar calendar, twelve methods of planting, the flower and fruit section, the tree fruit section, the fruit section, the woody flower section, the thorny flower section, the herbaceous flower section, the bamboo and wood section, the grass section, the vegetable section, and the melon and bean section. The organization is very clear, and the planting techniques are described in considerable detail. The preface and table of contents are all titled "Complete Book for Getting Rich," which is obviously a later alteration. It seems that later people thought that planting flowers and fruits could "lead to wealth," so they changed the name. It begins with a preface by Chen Yuansu in the gengshen year of the Wanli reign (1620 AD), as well as a preface by Wang Yuanmao and a self-preface. He himself says that he obtained ten volumes of "Flower History" hand-edited by Gu Changpei, which was compiled by Zhou Yunzhai. He "slightly regretted that its compilation was incomplete," so he added and supplemented it with what he saw and heard. Zhou Yunzhai's "Flower History," which is referred to in the book as "Yunzhai Flower Manual," is not seen today. However, this "History of the Garden" has surpassed it. He has indeed added a lot of his own experience. Many of the planting methods and experiences are still worthy of attention today. Zhou Wenhua's style name is Hánzhāng, and he is from Wujun. The "flower farmers" of Wujun are still famous far and wide, and they have indeed accumulated a rich tradition of excellent experience. In terms of agricultural side-line production, books like this are very useful. We should collect more of them, circulate them more widely, experiment with them more, and promote them more after experimentation.

    周文华：汝兰圃史
    上海的旧书店在清理底货。我听说修文堂清出此书来，亟向之购取，则已为北京来熏阁所得。回京后，乃向来熏阁取得。在论园艺的书里，这是一部比较详明的好书。凡十二卷，从月令、栽种十二法、花果部、木果部、水果部、木本花部、条刺花部、草本花部、竹木部、草部，到蔬菜部、瓜豆部，条理甚为明悉，栽种的技术也叙述得颇详细。序目均作“致富全书”，显系后来挖改。盖后人以种植花果足以“致富”，乃为易此名。首有万历庚申（公元一六二○年）陈元素序，又有王元懋序及自序。他自云，得顾长佩手订花史十卷，乃周允斋所辑。“稍恨其诠集未该”，遂以耳目睹记，加以增补。周允斋的花史，书中引作“允斋花谱”，今未见。但这部“圃史”却是后来居上的。他的确增加了不少自己的经验进去。有许多的种植方法和经验，是今天还应该加以重视的。周文华字含章，吴郡人。吴郡的“花农”现在还驰名遐迩，的确是累积了丰厚的传统的优良经验的。在搞农业副产方面，像这一类的书是极有用的，还应该多搜集，多流传，多加以实验，并于实验后，多加以推广才是。
