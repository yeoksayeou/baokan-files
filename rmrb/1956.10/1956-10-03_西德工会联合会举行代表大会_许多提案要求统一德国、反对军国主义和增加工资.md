Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 2nd. News from Hamburg: The West German Trade Union Federation's fourth congress, with 6.1 million members, opened in Hamburg on October 1st. Nearly a thousand delegates (including 403 voting delegates) attended the congress.

West German Chancellor Adenauer and Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer also attended the congress. Reuters said that "independent political observers" believe that Adenauer decided to attend the congress in consideration of the upcoming general election next year.

The opening of the meeting was presided over by the Vice Chairman of the West German Trade Union Federation, Georg Reuter (a Social Democrat), who criticized Adenauer's policy of rearming West Germany in his opening speech. He said: The situation of people receiving pensions should be improved and social welfare should be improved before the law on rearmament is passed. He believes that satisfying the people in terms of social welfare is better than "any number of divisions." His words won warm applause.

Adenauer did not respond to the criticisms against him when he spoke at the meeting. He said that due to his "responsible position," he must show restraint. He asked the workers not to be influenced by "temptations from the East."

The congress will review approximately 370 proposals and resolutions. Many of these proposals and resolutions call for opposition to remilitarization, opposition to conscription, opposition to fascist activities, and the peaceful use of atomic energy. A large number of proposals also call for shortening working hours, increasing real wages, improving social insurance, and allowing workers to participate in factory management.

Forty-four proposals call for the reunification of Germany and the establishment of links between eastern and western Germany, but the congress's proposal review committee recommended that the congress reject these proposals.

    西德工会联合会举行代表大会
    许多提案要求统一德国、反对军国主义和增加工资
    新华社柏林2日电　汉堡消息：拥有六百一十万会员的西德工会联合会第四次代表大会10月1日在汉堡开幕。将近一千名代表（其中有四百○三名代表是有表决权的）参加了这次代表大会。
    西德总理阿登纳和社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔也出席了这次代表大会。路透社说，“独立的政治观察家”认为，阿登纳是由于考虑到明年将要举行的大选而决定出席这次代表大会的。
    主持会议开幕的是西德工会联合会副主席乔治·鲁特（社会民主党人），他在开幕词中抨击了阿登纳的重新武装西德的政策。他说：应该在通过重新武装的法律以前首先考虑改善领取年金的人的处境和改进社会福利事业。他认为，在社会福利方面使人民满足，比“多少数目的师团”都要好。他的话赢得了热烈的掌声。
    阿登纳在会议上讲话的时候没有回答别人对他的批评。他说，由于他所处的“负责的地位”，他必须表现自制。他要求工人们不要受“来自东方的引诱”的影响。
    这次代表大会将审查大约三百七十件提案和决议。其中许多提案和决议提出了反对重新军国主义化、反对征兵、反对法西斯活动以及和平利用原子能的要求。还有很大一部分提案要求缩短工作时间，提高实际工资，改进社会保险事业和让工人参加工厂管理。
    有四十四件提案要求重新统一德国和在德国东部同西部之间建立联系，但是大会的提案审查委员会建议大会拒绝这些提案。
