The Singapore Industrial and Commercial Trade Delegation and the Federation of Malaya Industrial and Commercial Trade Delegation visited China from August 22, 1956, at the invitation of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. The delegation visited factories and other enterprises, agricultural production cooperatives, public buildings, schools, workers' sanatoriums, dormitories, and clubs in Beijing and Northeast China. After October 4, members of the delegation will visit and tour East China and South China separately.

During their stay in Beijing, the two delegations conducted trade negotiations with various Chinese import and export corporations. During the negotiations, they extensively exchanged views on the development of trade between China and Singapore and the Federation of Malaya, and reached transactions totaling approximately five million pounds.

The delegation's visit to China enhanced mutual understanding and friendship, established direct business contacts, and laid a good foundation for the future development of mutual trade. The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the Singapore Industrial and Commercial Trade Delegation, and the Federation of Malaya Industrial and Commercial Trade Delegation all expressed great satisfaction with the results of this visit and trade negotiations.

The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the Singapore Industrial and Commercial Trade Delegation, and the Federation of Malaya Industrial and Commercial Trade Delegation unanimously believe that there are broad prospects for the development of trade between China and Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. In the past, due to various artificial obstacles, direct trade between China and Singapore and the Federation of Malaya has not been able to achieve its due development. During this delegation's visit, Chinese import and export corporations have resumed purchasing rubber from Singapore and the Federation of Malaya and will continue to purchase it. This shows that developing normal trade relations is beneficial to both trading parties.

The delegation was pleased to note that Chinese state-owned import and export corporations believe that, in addition to rubber, Singapore and Malaya are also good sources of supply for commodities needed by China, such as coconut oil, tin ore, timber, and pepper, and also a valuable sales market for various Chinese industrial and agricultural products. Through this visit, there has been a further understanding of mutual needs and possibilities in terms of commodity exchange, which is conducive to the development of direct trade between China and Singapore and the Federation of Malaya.

In addition, discussions were held on shipping and banking matters. In order to promote trade between China and Singapore and Malaya, the Chinese side welcomes ships chartered by or registered in Singapore and Malaya to sail to Chinese ports; it also welcomes banks in Singapore and Malaya to establish direct business contacts with banks in China.

The achievements made by the delegation during its visit to China for more than a month demonstrate that mutual exchanges and visits by business people from various countries are of great help in promoting trade relations. The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the Singapore Industrial and Commercial Trade Delegation, and the Federation of Malaya Industrial and Commercial Trade Delegation unanimously hope that the contacts between business circles in China and Singapore and the Federation of Malaya should continue to be strengthened in the future.

    中国国际贸易促进委员会和新加坡工商业贸易考察团、马来亚联合邦工商业贸易考察团联合声明
    新加坡工商业贸易考察团和马来亚联合邦工商业贸易考察团应中华全国工商业联合会和中国国际贸易促进委员会的邀请于1956年8月22日到中国进行访问。考察团参观了北京和东北各地的工厂及其他企业、农业生产合作社、公共建筑物、学校和工人疗养院、宿舍及俱乐部等。10月4日以后，考察团团员将分别到华东和华南进行参观和访问。
    两个考察团在北京期间曾同中国各进出口公司进行了贸易谈判。在谈判中就开展中国和新加坡、马来亚联合邦之间的贸易问题广泛地交换了意见，并达成了总值约五百万英镑的交易。
    考察团在中国的访问，增进了相互之间的了解和友谊，建立了直接的业务联系，为今后相互贸易的发展打下了良好的基础。中国国际贸易促进委员会和新加坡工商业贸易考察团、马来亚联合邦工商业贸易考察团对此次访问和贸易谈判的结果都表示十分满意。
    中国国际贸易促进委员会和新加坡工商业贸易考察团、马来亚联合邦工商业贸易考察团一致认为，中国和新加坡、马来亚联合邦之间的贸易有着广阔的发展前途。过去由于各种人为的障碍，中国和新加坡、马来亚联合邦间的直接贸易没有能得到应有的发展。在这次考察团访问期间，中国进出口公司已经恢复向新加坡和马来亚联合邦购买橡胶，并且将继续购买。这说明发展正常的贸易来往，对贸易双方都是有利的。
    考察团高兴地注意到，中国各国营进出口公司认为除橡胶外，新加坡和马来亚也是中国所需要的椰子油、锡砂、木材、胡椒等商品的一个良好的供应来源而且也是中国各种工农业产品的一个有价值的销纳市场。通过这次访问，相互对商品交换方面的需要和可能有了进一步的了解，这就有利于中国和新加坡、马来亚联合邦之间直接贸易的发展。
    此外还进行了有关航运和银行业务的商谈。为促进中国和新加坡、马来亚之间的贸易，中国方面表示欢迎由新加坡、马来亚联合邦方面包租的或者在新加坡、马来亚联合邦注册的船只到中国港口航行；也欢迎在新加坡和马来亚的银行与在中国的银行建立直接的业务联系。
    考察团在访问中国的一个多月期间所获得的成就，说明了各国工商业人士的相互来往和访问对促进贸易关系是有很大帮助的。中国国际贸易促进委员会和新加坡工商业贸易考察团、马来亚联合邦工商业贸易考察团一致希望，中国和新加坡、马来亚联合邦之间工商界人士的联系今后应当继续加强。
