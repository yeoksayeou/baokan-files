Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 22nd. The Tangshan Municipal Workers' Living Conditions Visit Group, composed of more than 2,000 cadres from municipal-level agencies and factory and mining enterprises, conducted visits to the families of workers in factories, enterprises, capital construction units, and financial, cultural, educational, and health departments throughout the city from early to mid-October.

The visit group used methods such as individual visits and small-scale discussion meetings to learn in detail about the difficulties faced by workers' families in terms of eating, clothing, housing, medical treatment, and the supply of non-staple foods. They provided immediate cash subsidies to some workers' families who were currently experiencing financial difficulties.

Currently, various units, factories, and mines are sorting out and studying the opinions and requests put forward by the workers' families, preparing to make a comprehensive plan by the end of October to solve the workers' problems in production, work, study, and life.

During this period, the leaders of the Tangshan Municipal Party and government, trade unions, various units, and factories and mines also personally visited more than 250 senior intellectuals, technicians, and model workers to solicit their opinions and requests in terms of their lives, work, and studies.
