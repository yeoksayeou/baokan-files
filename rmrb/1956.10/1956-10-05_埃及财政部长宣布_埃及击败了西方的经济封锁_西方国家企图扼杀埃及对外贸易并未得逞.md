Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 4th: Egyptian Finance Minister Abdel Moneim El-Kaissouni stated on October 2nd that despite the Western countries' economic blockade against Egypt, the Egyptian economy is in a healthy state.

He said that after Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal, Western countries froze the Egyptian pounds, dollars, and francs stored in foreign banks. Some banks located in Egypt even attempted to obstruct the allocation of funds for harvesting cotton. Insurance premiums for ships passing through the Suez Canal or entering Egyptian ports increased by 350%. El-Kaissouni said, however, that freezing Egypt's deposits abroad "did not fundamentally affect Egypt's foreign trade because we relied on payment agreements signed with many countries and our friendly relations with them."

El-Kaissouni pointed out that four factors helped Egypt defeat the West's attempt to strangle its foreign trade. These factors are: 1. Bilateral agreements signed with other countries stipulate that Egypt can pay in currencies other than pounds and dollars. 2. Egypt's gold reserves are sufficient for several years. 3. Since the crisis began, non-pound and non-dollar foreign exchange has been obtained. 4. Egypt has obtained a loan of 15 million US dollars from the International Monetary Fund.

El-Kaissouni said that Egypt expects to export more cotton and rice in the future. He said: "When exports start and proceed normally, we will not encounter any difficulties as a result of the economic blockade, because the funds we obtain from exports will increase our foreign exchange reserves day by day and will enable us to maintain a smooth and uninterrupted supply of imports."

El-Kaissouni also pointed out that a sufficient supply of cotton funds is a stabilizing factor in the Egyptian economy.

He finally said: Generally speaking, Egypt's economic situation will definitely be satisfactory.

    埃及财政部长宣布
    埃及击败了西方的经济封锁
    西方国家企图扼杀埃及对外贸易并未得逞
    新华社4日讯　开罗消息：埃及财政部长阿卜杜勒·摩奈姆·凯舒尼10月2日说，尽管西方国家对埃及实行了经济封锁，埃及的经济还是处在一种健康的状态。
    他说，在埃及把苏伊士运河收归国有以后，西方国家冻结了埃及在国外银行储存的英镑、美元和法郎。某些设在埃及的银行还曾经企图阻挠为收获棉花拨款。通过苏伊士运河或进入埃及港口的船只的保险费提高了350％。凯舒尼说，但是，冻结埃及在国外的存款“并没有给埃及的对外贸易带来根本的影响，因为我们依靠着同许多国家签订的支付协定和同他们的友好的关系”。
    凯舒尼指出，四个因素帮助了埃及击败西方扼杀它的对外贸易的企图。这些因素是：一、和其它国家签订双边协定，规定埃及可以用英镑和美元以外的货币支付。二、埃及的黄金储备足够几年之用。三、自从危机开始以来，已经获得非英镑和非美元的外汇。四、埃及已经从国际货币基金取得一笔一千五百万美元的贷款。
    凯舒尼说，埃及期望在将来出口更多的棉花和大米。他说：“当出口开始和正常地进行的时候，我们不会因为经济封锁的结果而遇到任何困难，因为我们出口所取得的资金将使我们的外汇储备日益增加，并将促使我们能够保持一种舒畅的源源不绝的进口供应”。
    凯舒尼还指出，充分的棉花资金供应是埃及经济的稳定因素。
    他最后说：总的说来，埃及的经济情况定会令人满意。
