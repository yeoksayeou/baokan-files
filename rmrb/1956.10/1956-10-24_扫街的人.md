    Street Sweepers
    Jiang Che
    That afternoon on National Day, as I walked through Dongdan Square, the loudspeakers were still broadcasting the scene of the sports teams passing through Tiananmen Square. The doctors at the first-aid station were packing up their medicine kits and equipment; the people's police were taking care of the crowds watching the spectacle in the rain. At this time, I saw the sanitation workers also arriving in the rain. They were quickly dismantling the temporary toilets along the road and sweeping up the eggshells, waste newspapers, and confetti on the road. Among the sanitation workers wearing raincoats, I recognized the old worker Bai Bao'an, who was using a stick to knock the water off the cloth shed. The accumulated water mixed with the raindrops, covering his face with water droplets.
    Sanitation workers, formerly known as "scavengers" in the old society, were once the most despised and lowly profession. They dressed like beggars, their hair disheveled and their faces covered in dirt, struggling to pull carts with their frostbitten hands as they walked the streets...
    Bai Bao'an used to be like that. He is almost fifty years old this year and has been sweeping the streets for fifteen or sixteen years. When he was thirteen, his parents died, and he wandered the streets with his brother, who was his only relative. He pulled rickshaws, picked up garbage, and worked as a procession attendant for funerals, carrying paper figures and paper horses. During the years when the Japanese occupied Beijing and people ate mixed flour, his brother starved to death on the street, and he joined the sanitation team. Who would have thought that the sanitation team was no better than the outside world? People called it the "Beggar Team," but anyone with any other option wouldn't come here.
    Now, he serves as the deputy captain of the Chongwen District Sanitation Team, leading more than two hundred team members day and night on the streets.
    At one o'clock past midnight, when people are sound asleep, the sanitation workers get up, throw on their clothes, and, without even washing their faces, take their tools and go to the streets.
    There are no pedestrians on the street, and even the last patrol officer has returned. Everyone walks along the street without saying a word, as if afraid of disturbing the sleeping people. The sanitation workers are used to this kind of life and do not feel lonely at all.
    Before long, dust is stirred up on the street. When the dust is heavy, the streetlights seem to be covered in a thick fog, and sometimes you can't even see the person opposite you. Soon, sweat also appears, and although they have masks and windproof hats, the dust blows onto their faces and sticks with the sweat, making them look like mud men.
    The sky is slightly blue, and dawn is approaching. At this time, they also finish sweeping the last street. The street is still quiet, and sometimes they may encounter the first streetcar of the day. After returning, they first take a thorough shower, and then change into snow-white shirts and clean blue uniforms. The sun is out, and it's time to sleep, but some playful team members may also play poker for an hour or two.
    In fact, there are two people who can't sleep yet. After eating something, they go back on the road. After this, everyone has to take a turn during the day. These are the people we often see on the streets, wearing blue work clothes, masks, and pushing light green carts, patrolling the streets to maintain cleanliness.
    According to Bai Bao'an's position, he doesn't need to hold a broom anymore, but his decades of street sweeping have made him stubbornly love his work. Whenever there is a temporary shortage of people, he fills in, and at night he works on the streets with everyone. During the day, he also runs to the district health section, loading and unloading teams, and many other places, but his energy is always strong.
    Once, when I was walking with Bai Bao'an, he talked about his understanding of the Party: "I have long regarded the Party as family. Even when I hadn't joined the Party four years ago, I felt that I was already a Party member. The Party saved me, the Party cares about us sanitation workers, understands our hearts, and I also understand that the Party needs people like us." After a pause, he added:
    "Now there are many Party members and Youth League members in our sanitation team, and no one wants to lag behind in their work. They are really good!" He was very serious when he said this, and his eyes were shining.
    As I walked with him, he would stop from time to time. Suddenly, he would stop and point to a pile of broken bricks on the street and say to me: "I have to write it down and tell them to pay attention to cleaning it up tomorrow." Sometimes, after walking a few steps, he would run to the side to pick up fruit peels and waste paper discarded on the road. I asked him curiously, and he smiled and said softly: "This is already a habit of mine. I've been sweeping the streets for more than ten years, and I've developed feelings for the road. I feel bad even if I see only a piece of waste paper on the road!"
    I saw a precious quality in this old worker. After that, I always remembered his words, fearing that I might carelessly throw something dirty on the ground, which would only add trouble to the hard-working sanitation workers. (Attached image)

    扫街的人
    江车
    国庆节那天下午我走过东单广场，广播器里还播送着体育大队刚刚通过天安门广场的情形。救护站的医生们正收拾着药包、用具；人民警察在雨中照顾着看热闹的人群。这时候，我看见清洁队员们也冒雨赶到了这里，他们动作敏捷地拆除着路旁的临时厕所，清扫着路上的蛋皮、烂报纸、碎纸花……。在披着雨衣的清洁队员中间，我认出了有老队员柏保安，他正用棍子把布棚上的水打下来。积水和着雨点，洒得他脸上挂满了水珠。
    清洁队员，也就是旧社会所说的“清道夫”，这在过去是人们最看不起的一种低贱的职业。他们穿着的像乞丐一样，整天蓬首垢面地用冻裂的双手吃力地拉着土车在街上走过……。
    柏保安过去就是那个样子，他今年快五十岁了，已经扫了十五、六年的马路。十三岁时，他死去了父母，跟着一个相依为命的哥哥在街头流浪，他拉过人力车，拾过拉圾，给送葬的人家当过拿纸人、纸马的执事。正是日本占着北京，人们吃混合面的那年，哥哥饿死在街头，他才进了清洁队。谁想清洁队并不比外边好一点，人们都叫它是“乞丐队”，但凭有点办法谁也不会到这里来。
    如今，他担任了崇文区清洁队的付队长，每天要率领着二百多名队员，不分昼夜地奔波在街道上。
    午夜一时，当人们熟睡的时候，清洁队员们披衣起床，连脸也不洗，就拿好工具上街了。
    街上早已没有行人，连最后一班值勤的警察也回去了。大家走过街上，谁也不想多说一句话，好像生怕惊醒了甜睡的人们。这样的生活，清洁队员们早已习惯了，他们一点也不感到寂寞。
    扫不了多久，街上就扬起了灰尘，灰尘大时，路灯像罩在一片浓雾里，有时连对面的人也看不见了。不久，汗也冒了出来，虽然已有了口罩和防风帽，灰尘吹到了脸上就和汗粘在一起，看上去简直变成了泥人。
    天空微微发蓝，黎明即将到来，这时他们也扫完了最后一条街。街上还是静静的，有时也许会碰上最早出厂的第一班电车。回来以后，先到淋浴室大洗一通，然后就换上了雪白的衬衫、干净的蓝制服。太阳出来了，是该睡觉的时候了，但有些爱玩的队员也许还要打上一两个钟头的扑克。
    其实有两个人还不能睡下，吃点东西重又上路了，此后每一个人在白天都要轮上一次，这就是我们走过街头常可以看见的，那些穿着蓝色工作服，戴着口罩，推着轻便的绿色小车在街上巡回地作保洁工作的人。
    按柏保安担负的职务来说，他用不着再拿帚把了，但是十几年的扫街生活，使他执拗地热爱着自己的工作，不论哪里临时少了人，他都去代班，夜里就和大家一起上街干活。到白天，他还要往区卫生科、装卸队等好多地方跑，他的精神却永远是旺盛的。
    有一次，我和柏保安在一起走路的时候，他说起对党的认识：“我早就把党看作是一家人了，就是在我四年多前还没入党的时候，我就觉得自己算是党的人了。是党救了我，党关怀我们清洁队员，懂得我们的心，我也明白，党也需要我们这样的人。”停了一下他又说：
  “现在我们清洁队里有不少党员、团员，工作上谁也不想落后，真是好样的！”说这话时，他很认真，眼里也闪着光。
    和他走了一路，他不时地要停下来，一会儿突然地站住，指着街道上的一堆碎砖头跟我说：“我要记下来，明天要他们注意清扫。”有时走了几步，又跑到一旁去拾丢在路旁的果皮和烂纸，我好奇地问他，他笑了，低声地说：“我这已是习惯了，扫了十几年的街，跟马路总算有了感情，那怕看到路上只有一块碎纸呢，我心里也不好受！”
    我在这位老工人的身上看到一种可贵的品质。以后，他的那句话，我也总记着，惟恐自己一不注意会随手把脏东西扔在地上，那样不知又会给辛勤的清洁队员们增加多少麻烦。（附图片）
