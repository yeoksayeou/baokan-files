Comrade Yao Yilin, Vice Minister of Commerce, Speaks:

    Pork Production Is Insufficient and Supply Is Inadequate
　　The ways to increase production are: increase feed; raise the purchase price of live pigs; and encourage agricultural cooperative members to raise pigs independently.
　　I fully agree with the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhou Enlai, the new Party Constitution, and the suggestions for the Second Five-Year Plan.
　　I would now like to express some opinions on the supply of two major non-staple foods for our people—pork and vegetables.
　　Currently, there is a nationwide shortage of pork. Since 1955, the quantity of pork exported has not increased, the supply in large and medium-sized cities has decreased, and many small cities and rural market towns often have no meat to sell. It is a situation where the supply is tight in both urban and rural areas. I believe that the pork supply problem is no longer simply an ordinary commodity shortage but an important issue in the relationship between the Party and the people. The people are dissatisfied with us in this regard. From a longer-term perspective, as the number of employed people increases and the purchasing power of urban and rural residents rises, the demand for pork will also increase. If effective measures are not taken to solve this problem, the contradiction will become increasingly acute.
　　The main reason for the insufficient pork supply is insufficient production. From a production standpoint, it can be divided into two stages since the national liberation. Before 1954, the national pig production had been increasing, basically meeting the needs of the growing purchasing power of urban and rural residents. After 1954, both the quantity and quality of pigs declined, but the purchasing power of urban and rural residents increased, so the situation of supply falling short of demand became very prominent. The only way to solve this contradiction is to find every possible way to increase production so that output meets the needs of growing purchasing power.
　　The first way to increase production is to increase feed. The methods are: (1) Appropriately decentralize the processing industries of grain, oil crops, flour milling, and wine making, and appropriately restore grain processing workshops, oil mills, distilleries, and flour mills in rural market towns to increase rural feed. (2) Starting this autumn, when unified purchasing of grain is carried out, attention should be paid to retaining more feed grain. (3) Appropriately restore the original grain processing precision and stop using rice bran to extract oil. It can be assumed that after the tense situation of grain supply in our country has been initially alleviated, if we adopt a policy of slightly reducing grain reserves in the next one or two years, we can raise more pigs. Raising more pigs, in turn, can increase fertilizer and increase grain production.
　　The second way to increase production is to raise the purchase price of live pigs. Since liberation, pig prices have been increasing year by year, and the ratio of pig prices to grain prices is generally about 10 percent higher than before the war. However, after the unified purchase and sale of grain and agricultural cooperation, the situation has changed. In the past, individual farmers did not count labor and part of the feed as costs when raising pigs, and rice bran was also cheap at that time, so it was profitable for farmers to raise pigs. Now, whether cooperative farms or members raise pigs, labor and feed costs must be counted as costs, and rice bran is very expensive, so the purchase price must be increased. Because we did not study this issue in a timely manner, it now seems late, and it has already had an adverse impact on production. According to calculations, if the average purchase price is increased by 15 percent, most places can make a profit from raising pigs. If some places are still not profitable enough, they can be raised a little more, and some places do not need to be raised so much. After the purchase price is increased, in order to keep the current selling price basically unchanged to maintain market stability, it can be considered to appropriately reduce the national slaughter tax rate and greatly reduce the commercial profits of state-owned commercial enterprises in operating live pigs.
　　The third way to increase production is that agricultural production cooperatives should encourage members to raise pigs independently as the main breeding method, help members solve the difficulties in feed and time in raising pigs, rationally stipulate the price of pig manure, and allow members to dispose of the income from raising pigs themselves, so that raising pigs continues to be a major household sideline for farmers.
　　In addition, in places where assigned purchases are implemented, it is necessary to fully consult with farmers and stipulate the assigned purchase figures according to needs and possibilities, increasing production without increasing purchases; it is necessary to leave a portion of pigs for farmers to slaughter and eat themselves, slaughter and share, or slaughter and sell themselves; when purchasing a pig, it is necessary to ensure that several kilograms of meat and several kilograms of oil are given to the farmers who raise the pigs; state purchasing agencies must both purchase and sell, supplying the needs of local people, and cannot only collect pigs and not sell meat, especially during the Spring Festival, it is important to do a good job in supplying. In terms of purchasing grades and pricing, it is necessary to consult with farmers to stipulate practical methods based on local historical customs, strictly prevent suppressing grades and prices, and also prevent the purchase of satiated, big-bellied pigs. All of the above are important policy issues in purchasing work. In the past few years, some places have had better experiences, ensuring that the state does not suffer losses and farmers are satisfied. However, there are still very serious problems in many places. The commercial sector has not done enough to summarize and promote these experiences in the past, and has not done enough to check and correct deviations in the implementation of policies, which should be paid attention to in the future. In addition, pigsties, cold storage, and meat processing equipment must be adapted to the growth of supply, which is also an important issue that needs to be resolved.

    The Supply of Vegetables in Cities Has Increased
　　The problems that need to be solved now are: appropriately increase the planting area in places where planting is insufficient; and correctly solve the production and sales relationship and supply methods.

　　Now I will talk about the vegetable issue. The vegetable issue mainly involves the supply problems of large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas. It is mainly produced and sold locally and is generally not suitable for long-distance transportation. In the past two years, due to the expansion of vegetable planting areas in the suburbs of various cities, the quantity of vegetable supply has greatly increased, except for a few new industrial and mining areas. Therefore, the current problem is that, on the one hand, places where vegetable planting is insufficient should pay attention to appropriately expanding the planting area, and on the other hand, it is necessary to correctly solve the production and sales relationship and supply methods.
　　At present, some large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas have adopted the method of unified purchase and sales of vegetables produced by farmers by state-owned vegetable companies, not allowing producers and consumers to directly trade, and canceling farmers' trade markets. The motivation for implementing this method is to stabilize vegetable prices and ensure supply, but the result of implementation is bound to produce the following consequences in production and supply: (1) Producers emphasize quantity over quality, do not sell fresh and tender vegetables, but wait until they are old before selling, in order to increase weight and sell more money. Moreover, they often sow in large areas, harvest centrally, and deliver goods centrally, causing a surge in the market during peak seasons, resulting in large-scale mold and spoilage losses. (2) In order to unilaterally increase production, many vegetables with small quantities and high quality are planted less, becoming mass-produced goods. (3) In order to uniformly distribute vegetables, state-owned vegetable companies have established huge management agencies, increasing the number of links, increasing costs, and making procedures complicated, which is very inconvenient for consumers, and makes consumers unable to eat fresh vegetables of the day, causing a large number of fresh vegetables to mold and deteriorate during the peak season. We believe that this operating method is not suitable for the objective laws of vegetable commodity circulation.
　　Vegetable production is greatly affected by natural conditions, and it is also a commodity with great seasonality and is easily perishable. There are many varieties, and the quality must be kept fresh and tender. Only a few vegetables such as radishes, Chinese cabbage, and potatoes, as well as some dried vegetables and pickled vegetables, and soybeans, mung beans, broad beans, and miscellaneous grains can be stored for a long time to make bean sprouts, tofu, vermicelli, and other bean products at any time. Other than that, other fresh vegetables cannot be stored for a long time. In response to this characteristic, the following issues must be resolved in vegetable production and supply: First, vegetable production must be planted in batches and in stages, with many varieties, and the quality of the market must be fresh and tender. Second, during the peak season, people should be encouraged to buy more, dry and pickle them, store them separately, and some low-quality vegetables should be used as feed locally; in the off-season, radishes, potatoes, bean products, pickled vegetables, dried vegetables, and other vegetables that can be stored for a long time should be used to regulate people's needs. Third, it is necessary to advocate producers and consumers to meet directly as much as possible, reduce the intermediate links to a minimum, make it convenient for consumers to purchase, and enable them to eat fresh vegetables that are on the market that day.
　　In order to achieve the above requirements, the method of unified purchase and sales cannot be adopted in vegetable operation. In terms of price policy, there must be a certain degree of flexibility, and it cannot be assumed that vegetable prices are fixed.
　　We believe that the following methods should be adopted in vegetable operation to meet the needs of producers and consumers. First, the commercial department should propose reference indicators for vegetable production based on the general needs of the market, and supply them to agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs for reference after being approved by the Party and government organs. Agricultural cooperatives can change them according to market conditions. Second, state-owned vegetable companies should organize agricultural cooperatives and large vegetable-using units to sign contracts as much as possible to directly deliver goods. And organize several vegetable markets in the city or suburbs, allowing agricultural cooperatives, members, and individual farmers to freely sell fresh vegetables in the market, allowing all vegetable stores, small vendors, organs, troops, schools, factories, and any consumers in the city to freely purchase in the market, with direct transactions between both parties. Third, state-owned vegetable companies should sign contracts with agricultural production cooperatives according to the needs of the local vegetable off-season to purchase a certain amount of vegetables that can be stored for a longer period, such as radishes, Chinese cabbage, and potatoes, and store a part of beans in order to regulate the market during the vegetable off-season. For the convenience of transportation and storage, vegetable companies should organize canteens of organs, troops, schools, and factories and vegetable retail stores to directly take vegetables from agricultural cooperatives and store them separately as much as possible. Fourth, the market price of fresh vegetables should be negotiated by producers and purchasers themselves, and the state does not stipulate list prices. In order to prevent vegetable prices from rising excessively, the state can stipulate the maximum price limit according to different seasons and different varieties. When the market is out of stock, the vegetable company can manage and arrange it in a unified manner. State-owned vegetable companies stipulate state list prices for bulk vegetables such as radishes, potatoes, and bean products, and do not blindly rise and fall with market supply and demand, but there should also be certain seasonal price differences and quality price differences. Fifth, it is generally not appropriate to organize joint purchase and sales cooperative stores that share profits and losses for small vegetable vendors. Cooperative groups with their own profits and losses should be the main form, which is more conducive to giving play to their enthusiasm, facilitating the full use of auxiliary family labor, and avoiding drawbacks such as many links, high costs, low personal income, and low enthusiasm. In places where joint purchase and sales have already been organized, it is also possible to consider changing large cooperative stores into small cooperative stores with three or five stores in a group.
　　After the above methods are implemented, the urban vegetable market will become a free trade market with a certain scope under the leadership of the state. The leadership of the state is manifested in: there are reference plans for production, state-owned vegetable companies sell bulk vegetables that can be stored for a long time at state list prices to regulate people's needs in the vegetable off-season, and there are maximum price limits and unified management arrangements. This market also has a certain range of freedom, which is manifested in: producers can formulate and change plans according to market needs, and can freely negotiate prices with consumers and directly transact within the scope stipulated by the state. We believe that after adopting this method, it can greatly give play to the enthusiasm of agricultural cooperatives, enabling them to study the changes in the needs of urban people, plant in batches and in stages, not only ensure fresh and tender quality, meet the needs of the people, but also increase the income of members. After adopting this method, can vegetable prices be basically stabilized? We think it is possible. Because the main way to stabilize vegetable prices is to plant a sufficient amount of vegetables in the suburbs of the city, plus state-owned vegetable companies control a certain amount of bulk vegetables and beans that can be stored for a longer period of time, and regulate them in the vegetable off-season. As long as the above two points are achieved, vegetable prices can only fluctuate up and down seasonally, and will not fluctuate only upwards if there are no unexpected disasters. Only in this way can the combination of vegetable production and sales and the supply methods be correctly resolved.
　　Please criticize and correct the above opinions, comrades.

    采取有效措施解决猪肉和蔬菜供应问题
    商业部副部长　姚依林同志的发言
    猪肉生产不够供应不足
　　增加生产的办法是：增加饲料；提高生猪收购价格；鼓励农业社员分散养猪。
　　我完全同意刘少奇、邓小平、周恩来同志的报告，新的党章和第二个五年计划的建议。
　　我现在对我国人民的两项主要副食品——猪肉和蔬菜的供应问题，发表一些意见。
　　现在全国猪肉都供应不足。一九五五年以来，猪肉出口数量没有增加，大、中城市供应量下降，许多小城市和农村集镇经常没有肉卖，是一个城市和乡村供应都很紧张的局面。我认为猪肉供应问题已经不单纯是一个普通的商品脱销问题，而是党和人民关系中的一个重要问题，人民在这方面对我们是不满意的。从今后较长期来看，劳动就业人数越增加，城乡人民购买力越提高，对猪肉的需求也就越多，如果不采取有效的措施加以解决，矛盾是会越来越尖锐的。
　　猪肉供应不足的主要原因是生产不够。从生产上来看，从全国解放以来，可以分成两个阶段。一九五四年以前，全国猪的产量一直是增加的，基本上能满足城乡人民购买力增长的需要。一九五四年以后，猪的产量和质量都下降了，但城乡人民购买力却是增长的，因此供不应求的情况就很突出。解决这个矛盾的唯一出路，就是要想一切办法来增加生产，使产量适应购买力增长的需要。
　　增加生产的第一项办法是增加饲料。办法是：（一）适当分散粮食、油料作物、制粉、酿酒等加工工业，适当恢复农村集镇的粮食加工作坊、油坊、糟坊、粉坊，以增加农村饲料。（二）从今年秋季起，在统购粮食时，应当注意多留一些饲料粮。（三）适当恢复原有的粮食加工精度，停止用米糠榨油。可以设想，在我国粮食供应的紧张局面已经初步缓和之后，如果采取一两年内少增加一些粮食储备的方针，是可以多养一些猪的。多养了猪，反过来又可以增加肥料，增产粮食。
　　增加生产的第二项办法是提高生猪收购价格。自从解放以来，猪价是逐年提高的，猪和粮食的比价一般高于战前百分之十左右。但在粮食统购统销和农业合作化以后，情况发生了变化。过去个体农民养猪，人工和一部分饲料是不算成本的，那时米糠价钱也低，农民养猪是有利的。现在是不论合作社养猪或者社员自己养猪，人工和饲料费用都要算成本，米糠价钱又很贵，因此收购价格就非提高不可了。由于我们对这个问题研究不及时，现在已经显得晚了，对生产已经有不利的影响。据计算，如果平均提高收购价百分之十五，多数地方可以做到喂猪有利，有些地方如果还不够本，可以再提高一点，有些地方可以不必提高这么多。在收购价提高以后，为了保持目前销售价基本不动，以保持市场的稳定，可以考虑适当减低国家的屠宰税率，并大大减少国营商业经营生猪的商业利润。
　　增加生产的第三项办法是农业生产合作社要以鼓励社员分散养猪为主要的饲养方法，帮助社员解决养猪在饲料上和时间上的困难，合理地规定猪粪价格，养猪收入归社员自己支配，使养猪继续成为农民的一项主要家庭副业。
　　此外，在实行派购的地方，要充分与农民协商，按照需要和可能来规定派购数字，增产不增购；必须给农民留下一部分猪自宰自食、自宰分食或者自宰出售；在派购一口猪的时候，要保证分几斤肉、几斤油给养猪的农民；国家收购机关必须连收带卖，供应当地人民需要，不能只收猪，不卖肉，特别是在过年过节的时候要注意做好供应工作。在收购等级和作价上，要根据当地历史习惯，与农民协商规定实际可行的办法，要严格制止压级压价，也要防止收进饱食大肚猪。以上这些都是收购工作中重要的政策问题，过去几年来，有些地方已经有了较好的经验，做到了国家不吃亏、农民满意。但也有不少地方仍然存在着很严重的问题。商业部门过去对这些经验的总结和推广做得不够，对于执行政策中的偏差检查纠正不够，今后应当加以注意。此外，猪圈、冷库和肉类加工设备必须与供应量的增长相适应，这也是一个需要注意解决的重要问题。
    城市蔬菜供应量已增加
　　目前要解决的问题是：种植不够的地方要适当增加种植面积；产销关系和供应方法要加以正确解决。
　　现在讲一下蔬菜问题。蔬菜问题主要是大、中城市和工矿区的供应问题，它主要是在当地生产、当地销售的，一般不适宜于远距离调运。近两年来，由于各城市郊区扩大了蔬菜种植面积，除了少数新工矿区以外，蔬菜供应数量已经大为增加。因此，目前的问题，一方面是蔬菜种植不够的地方还要注意适当地扩大种植面积，另一方面是要正确地解决产销关系和供应方法问题。
　　目前有一些大中城市和工矿区，在蔬菜经营上，采取了将农民生产的蔬菜，一律由国营蔬菜公司统购包销的办法，不许生产者和消费者直接成交，取消了农民贸易市场。实行这种办法的动机，是为了稳定菜价和保证供应，但是执行的结果，在生产上和供应上却必然要产生以下的后果：（一）生产者重量不重质，不卖鲜嫩蔬菜，等长老了再卖，以求分量多，多卖钱。而且往往大片播种、集中收获，集中交货，在旺季时上市过涌，造成大批霉烂损失。（二）片面地为了提高产量，把许多数量少、品质高的蔬菜种得少了，变成了大路货。（三）国营蔬菜公司为了统一分配蔬菜，设立了庞大的管理机关，环节加多，费用很大，手续繁复，对消费者很不便利，并使消费者吃不到当天的新鲜蔬菜，使大批鲜菜在大量上市季节霉烂变质。我们认为这种经营方法是不适合蔬菜商品流转的客观规律的。
　　蔬菜生产受自然条件的影响很大，同时又是一种季节性很大，很容易腐烂变质的商品，品种既多，质量又必须保持鲜嫩。能够较长时期保存的，只有萝卜、大白菜、土豆等几种蔬菜和一些干菜、腌菜，还有黄豆、绿豆、蚕豆、杂粮等可以长期保存随时制造豆芽、豆腐、粉丝和其他豆制品。除此而外，其他新鲜蔬菜都是不能长期保存的。针对这种特点，在蔬菜生产和供应上必须解决以下几个问题：第一，蔬菜生产必须分期分批地排开种植，种类要多，上市的质量要鲜嫩。第二，在大量上市季节，要鼓励人民多买，晒干腌制，分散储存，有一部分质量很低的菜要就地充作饲料；在缺菜季节，要用萝卜、土豆、豆制品、腌菜、干菜等可以长期保存的蔬菜来调剂人民需要。第三，要尽可能提倡生产者和消费者直接见面，把中间环节减少到最低限度，使消费者购买便利，并能吃得到当天上市的鲜菜。
　　为了要达到以上的要求，在蔬菜经营上，就不能采取统购包销的办法。在价格政策上必须有一定的灵活性，不能设想蔬菜价格固定不变。
　　我们认为蔬菜经营应当采取以下的方法，才能适合生产者和消费者的需要。第一，由商业部门根据市场上大体的需要情况，提出蔬菜生产的参考指标，经党政机关批准后供给郊区农业生产合作社作为参考，农业社可以根据市场情况加以改变。第二，国营蔬菜公司应当尽可能组织农业社和大的用菜单位订定合同，直接送货。并在城内或城郊组织若干个蔬菜市场，允许农业社、社员、个体农民到市场上自由出售新鲜蔬菜，允许城市一切蔬菜商店、小商小贩，机关、部队、学校、工厂和任何消费者到市场自由购买，双方直接成交。第三，国营蔬菜公司根据当地缺菜季节的需要，和农业生产合作社订定合同，收购一定数量的萝卜、大白菜、土豆等可以较长期贮存的蔬菜，并且贮备一部分豆子，以便在缺菜时调剂市场。为了运输和贮存的便利，蔬菜公司应当尽可能组织机关、部队、学校、工厂的伙食单位和蔬菜零售店向农业社直接取菜，分散贮存。第四，市场新鲜蔬菜价格由生产者和收购者自行议定，国家不规定牌价。为了防止菜价过分上涨，可以根据不同季节和不同品种，由国家规定最高限价，市场缺货时可以由蔬菜公司统一管理安排。国营蔬菜公司出售的萝卜、土豆、豆制品等大宗蔬菜，则规定国家牌价，不盲目地随市场供求而涨落，但也应有一定的季节差价和品质差价。第五，对于零售蔬菜的小商小贩，一般不宜于组织联购联销共负盈亏的合作商店，应当以各负盈亏的合作小组为主要形式，这样更便于发挥他们的积极性，便于充分利用家庭辅助劳动力，避免环节多、费用大、个人收入少、积极性不高等弊病。在已经组织了联购联销的合作商店的地方，也可以考虑把大型的合作商店改成三、五家一组的小型合作商店。
　　实行了以上的办法，城市蔬菜市场就成为国家领导之下的有一定范围的自由贸易的市场。国家的领导表现在：有生产的参考计划，有国营蔬菜公司在缺菜季节按国家牌价出售大宗的、能较长时期保管的蔬菜调剂人民需要，有最高限价和统一的管理安排。这个市场同时又有一定范围的自由，表现在：生产者能根据市场需要订定和改变计划，能在国家规定的范围内同消费者自由论价，直接成交。我们认为采取这种办法以后，可以大大发挥农业社的积极性，使他们研究城市人民需要的变化，分期分批，排开种植，既能保证质量鲜嫩，满足人民的需要，同时又能增加社员的收入。采取了这种办法以后，能不能够基本上稳定蔬菜价格呢？我们认为可能。因为稳定菜价的主要办法，是在城市郊区种植足够数量的蔬菜，再加上国营蔬菜公司掌握一定数量的能够较长期保存的大宗蔬菜和豆类，在缺菜季节进行调剂。只要做到了以上两点，就可以使蔬菜价格只有季节性的上下摆动，如果没有意外灾歉，不致发生只涨不落的波动。只有这样，才能正确地解决蔬菜的产销结合和供应方法问题。
　　以上意见请各位同志批评指正。
