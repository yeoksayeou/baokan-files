    Seeing Subjectivism from the Promotion of "White Horse Tooth" Corn
    Ke Lin
    Not long ago, I went to Ding County, Hebei Province, to understand the production situation. Some cadres and farmers talked to me about agricultural technology reform and the dense planting and seedling pulling of White Horse Tooth corn. These conversations made me deeply feel how important the responsibility of leaders is: a correct decision and measure can benefit tens of millions of people; a moment of carelessness, a wrong instruction, can also cause losses to millions of people.
    Like other counties in Hebei, Ding County set excessively high production targets in this spring's production upsurge. Promoting White Horse Tooth corn and implementing double-plant dense planting was one of the important measures to achieve this target. The Baoding Prefectural Committee assigned Ding County a planting task of 165,000 mu, and the Ding County Party Committee and rural cadres spent a lot of effort, actually only completing a little more than 100,000 mu.
    In the past, Ding County mostly planted local yellow corn, and no key experiments were conducted on White Horse Tooth corn. If this kind of seed is used, what about the regional adaptability? Are all the conditions in place? The leadership didn't have much confidence. When the task was distributed downwards, it was resisted by farmers from all sides. Some said that Ding County has a lot of sandy soil, and the manure is easily lost, so it is not suitable to plant a lot of White Horse Tooth corn; some said that White Horse Tooth corn requires too much manure, and the fertilizer is not enough to "feed it," so it only grows stalks and leaves without kernels. Especially for double-plant dense planting, the farmers' thinking was even more resistant. They said: It's already difficult enough to grow a single plant well, let alone two plants in one hole. Despite these reactions, the planting plan had to be completed. At the production mobilization meeting held by the county party committee, it was emphasized that planting must be done according to the national plan and technical operating procedures. Individual cadres even one-sidedly emphasized that the plan is "law" and not executing it is "illegal." During the planting process, the technical station personnel worked hard, taking rulers to the fields to see if they met the dense planting "regulations."
    How did the masses treat this planting task? I heard the following things:
    The members of the Zecheng Township Agricultural Cooperative couldn't understand how to plant more than 4,000 plants per mu, and especially to plant double plants densely; the captain of a production team led the whole team to quietly pull seedlings, pulling out more than 1,000 plants per mu. Fearing that the piles of seedlings would reveal traces, they dug ditches along the wheat field ridges and buried the seedlings in them. When the corn grew taller and taller, the leaves of the double-plant densely planted corn were mostly yellow, only the corn of this team was dark green and strong. Later, when the official instruction to pull seedlings was issued, they stood up righteously and said: "We already pulled them out!"
    Beineibu and other villages secretly prepared local corn seeds when sowing. In order to deceive the eyes of the staff, some planted White Horse Tooth corn on the edges of the fields and local corn in the middle; some villages left double plants by the roadside and single plants in the center of the fields. As a result, the ones in the center of the field grew very well, and many of the ones on the edge were empty plants and empty husks. These things are truly a profound irony for some subjectivist leaders. Why do they spend so much effort to do good things for the masses, trying to increase grain production for the farmers, but they secretly "sabotage" it? This cannot be blamed on the farmers, it only shows that the leadership cannot combine with the masses, and the subjective requirements cannot be accepted by the masses. Even if these measures are completely correct! When the masses don't understand its benefits, instead of persuading and educating them, just using various "hats" and pressure to force them, then it's no wonder the farmers give you a "yes in words, no in deeds."
    Subjectivist leadership not only causes material losses to the people, but also greatly damages the connection between the Party and the masses, and damages the farmers' feelings towards the Party. When the Baoding Prefectural Committee discovered that the seedlings were too dense and issued instructions to pull the seedlings, there was a wave of complaints everywhere. A district cadre told me: If the farmers didn't usually trust the Party and have feelings for the Party, they would have rioted long ago! Many members pulled the seedlings with tears in their eyes, saying that they had put in a lot of labor and a lot of manure, and they had cultivated them so tall, pulling them up was really "heartbreaking." A member of Zhao Village sadly recited while pulling the seedlings: "White Horse Tooth, White Horse Tooth! I planted you for socialism, and I pull you out also for socialism!" The painful mood of this member is understandable. It is precisely for socialism that we want to do everything possible to increase crop yields and accelerate national construction, but subjectivism has put stumbling blocks in our path forward. Full of enthusiasm to lead the people to build socialism, but just because the ideological method and work method are not correct, it has caused losses to the people. The people know that the leaders have "good intentions," but when they suffer losses, they can't help but angrily say that this kind of work is a "man-made disaster." They say: "Natural disasters can still be overcome, but man-made disasters are difficult to eliminate." The saying "man-made disaster" seems excessive, but who can deny and erase these "man-made disasters" caused by subjectivist errors in leadership ideology and style!
    I once talked to several farmers in Hanjiawa Township, Ding County, about White Horse Tooth corn. An old farmer who knew this variety said: "White Horse Tooth is indeed a good variety, but it requires good conditions. As long as the land is good and the manure is sufficient, the yield is high. But our area has thin soil, planting so much and so densely, how can it not reduce production?" I asked them, if you know it won't work, why don't you raise objections? Someone excitedly said: "We raised objections! As soon as we mentioned it, the cadres said: No! This is a national regulation, who will be responsible if the production target is not reached? No one dared to say a word after that question, who would dare to take that responsibility?" I said: "Didn't you ask back: Who will be responsible for the reduced production?" Several people almost unanimously said: "Ordinary people dare not say that, it's a national regulation." Finally, they sighed and said: "The higher-ups are too strict! What kind of soil grows what kind of crops, this is not a joke. The higher-ups sit above and make plans, how can they know how much fertilizer our Hanjiawa has, and how many mu of land are suitable for planting White Horse Tooth? Is the assigned number exactly right?..."
    The short conversation gave me great enlightenment. "The higher-ups are too strict!" This is the voice of the farmers. It raises the requirement of adapting to local conditions, and also raises the requirement of fully developing democracy and discussing with the masses more. More importantly, it raises the question of how the agricultural cooperative's planting plan should be formulated. This kind of one-sided top-down allocation of planned numbers, forcibly ordering the cooperative to implement it, completely negates the operating independence of the agricultural cooperative, and this approach really needs to be changed. No matter how wise the leader is, no matter how careful the investigation and research, with thousands upon thousands of villages, thousands upon thousands of pieces of land, how can you accurately calculate which villages have which mu of land suitable for planting White Horse Tooth corn?
    The promotion of White Horse Tooth corn is not all failures here. In a small number of places with good land and sufficient manure, good harvests were also obtained. In this contrast between success and failure, people feel more and more the importance of adapting agricultural plans to local conditions. Subjectivism is certainly the thinking of some leaders, but sometimes certain systems and practices themselves will inevitably promote subjectivism. Of course, some of these systems and practices are precisely the products of subjectivism.

    从推广“白马牙”看主观主义
    克林
    不久以前，我到河北省定县了解生产情况，一些干部和农民曾经同我谈到有关农业技术改革和白马牙玉米密植拔苗的问题。那些谈话，使我深深地感到领导者的责任是多么重大：一个正确的决定和措施，可以造福于千万人民；一念之差，一个错误的指示，也会给千万人造成损失。
    定县和河北其他县份一样，在今春生产高潮中制定了过高的生产指标。推广白马牙玉米，实行双株密植，是实现这个指标的重要措施之一。保定地委分配给定县的种植任务是十六万五千亩，定县县委和农村干部费了很大劲，实际上才完成十万亩多一些。
    定县过去多种本地黄玉米，对白马牙玉米没有作过重点试验。如果采用这种种籽，地域适应性如何？各种条件是否具备？领导上也没大的把握。当任务往下分配的时候，曾经受到农民各方面的抵抗。有的说定县沙质土壤多，粪土流失性大，不能多种白马牙；有的说白马牙太费粪，肥料少“喂不饱”，光长秆叶不结籽。特别是对于双株密植，农民思想更为不通，他们说：单株还怕长不好哩，一窝两株更不成。尽管有这些反映，可是种植计划却不能不完成。在县委召开的生产动员会上，曾强调一定要按国家计划种植，按技术操作规程办事，个别干部甚至片面地强调说计划就是“法律”，不执行就是“犯法”。在种植的过程中，技术站人员们都辛苦地带着尺子下地，看是否合乎密植“规程”。
    群众是怎样来对待这个种植任务呢？我曾听到这样一些事：
    泽城乡农业社的社员们，对于每亩要种到四千棵以上，而且要双株密植，思想怎也不通；有个生产队的队长就领导全队悄悄去拔苗，每亩拔去一千多株。大堆苗子怕露出痕迹，他们就顺麦地垅沟挖沟把苗子埋进去。当玉米越长越高的时候，双株密植的叶子大都发黄了，唯有这个队的玉米黑绿肥壮。后来，上边正式发下拔苗的指示，他们才理直气壮地站出来说：“我们早已拔过了！”
    北内部等村在播种的时候悄悄准备了本地玉米种。为了骗过工作人员的眼睛，有的地边种的白马牙，当中种的本地玉米；有的村把大路边的留双株，地中心的留成单株。结果地中心的长得很好，地边的很多是空株空壳。这些事，对一些主观主义的领导者真是深刻的讽刺。为什么费尽心机为群众办好事，想法给农民增产粮食，而他们却暗地“捣鬼”呢？这不能怨农民，这只是说明领导不能和群众结合，主观要求不能为群众接受。即使说这些措施是完全正确的吧！当群众还不懂得它的好处的时候，不去说服教育他们，只是用各种“帽子”和压力强制他们，那也就难怪农民们给你来个“阳奉阴违”了。
    主观主义的领导，不仅使人民受到物质的损失，而且大大损伤了党和群众的联系，损伤了农民对党的感情。当保定地委发现苗太稠发下拔苗指示的时候，到处一片埋怨声。有个区干部告诉我说：要不是农民平素信赖党，对党有感情，早就闹开了！有不少社员含着眼泪拔苗，说是费了很多劳动，上了很多粪，培养这样高，拔起来真是“手软心疼”。赵村有个社员一边拔一边难过地念道着：“白马牙呀白马牙！我种你是为了社会主义，我拔你还是为了社会主义！”这个社员的痛苦心情可以理解。正是为了社会主义，我们才想一切办法来提高农作物产量，加速国家建设，而主观主义却在我们前进的道路上放下了绊脚石。满腔热情领导人民建设社会主义，只是因为思想方法工作方法不对头，却给人民造成了损失。人民知道领导者是“好心”，但当他们遭受损失时，却不禁激怒地说这种干法是“人祸”，他们说：“天灾还可战胜，人祸却难消除。”“人祸”这说法似乎言之过分，可是，谁能否认和抹杀由于领导思想作风上的主观主义错误所造成的这些“人为的灾害”呢！
    我曾经和定县韩家洼乡几个农民谈到白马牙。一个知道这个品种的老农说：“白马牙确是好种，就是要条件好，只要地好粪饱，产量是高。可是咱这一带地皮薄，种这样多又这样密，怎能不减产？”我问他们，你们明知道不行为什么不提意见？有人激动地说：“提过！一提干部们就说：不行！这是国家规定，达不到增产指标谁负责？这一问谁也不敢吭一声了，谁敢负人家这责任？”我说：“你们就没反问：减了产谁负责任？”几个人几乎不约而同地说：“老百姓谁敢那样说，国家的规定。”最后他们感叹说：“上级管的太严了！什么地土长什么庄稼，这事不是闹着玩的，上级坐在上边订计划，他咋能知道咱韩家洼有多少肥料，有几亩地适合种白马牙？分派的数字就恰合适？……”
    短短的谈话给我以很大启示。“管的太严了！”这是农民们的呼声。这里提出了因地制宜的要求，也提出了充分发扬民主多和群众商量的要求，更为重要的是提出了农业社的种植计划应该怎样制定的问题。这种片面地自上而下的分配计划数字，强制命令合作社执行，完全抹杀农业社的经营独立性的作法，确实是需要改变了。不管多么英明的领导者，经过多么仔细的调查研究，千千万万的村庄，千千万万片土地，你怎能准确地算出哪几个村有哪几亩地适合种白马牙呢？
    白马牙的推广在这里并不全都是失败的，有很少数地好粪饱的地方也得到了很好的收成。在这成功失败的对比里，使人越感到农业计划因地制宜的重要。主观主义固然是某些领导人的思想，但有时候某些制度和作法本身就不可避免地会促成主观主义。——当然，这些制度和作法，有些也正是主观主义的产物。
