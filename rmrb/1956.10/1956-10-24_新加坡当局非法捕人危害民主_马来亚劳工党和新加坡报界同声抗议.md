Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd, Singapore News: The Malayan Labour Party issued a statement on October 18th, accusing the Singapore government of invoking deportation orders and public safety ordinances to arrest social organization workers, teachers, and students.

    The Malayan Labour Party believes that arresting fifteen people and closing three organizations without presenting evidence for a public trial by invoking these two ordinances is an undemocratic measure that endangers the personal freedom of the people.

    The statement said: "What we object to is arresting people without sufficient evidence and without conducting public trials. This is a very dangerous system, and if it is not stopped, it will infringe upon the freedom of every aspect of our daily lives, making us afraid at the sound of boots."

    In addition, according to newspaper reports, the first group of six people detained in the Singapore government's mass arrest operation may be deported soon. After these six people were arrested on September 18th, their families immediately entrusted lawyers to appeal to the Singapore Council of Ministers. However, the Council of Ministers rejected the lawyers' appeal on October 18th without giving any reason.

    Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd, Singapore News: The Singapore press opposes the Singapore government's continuous arrest of two news workers, Xie Yong and Qiu Youcai, on October 15th and 16th.

    Rajaratnam, Chairman of the Singapore Union of Journalists, led ten representatives of the union to meet with Singapore Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock on October 18th, demanding that the government unconditionally release the arrested news workers or present evidence for a public trial.

    The English-language "Straits Times" also published an editorial on October 19th, stating that the arrest of Xie Yong and Qiu Youcai has, in effect, plunged freedom of speech in Singapore into crisis. The "Xin Bao" published a commentary on October 18th, demanding that the government, in accordance with democratic principles, present true and solid evidence and conduct public trials of those arrested, so that those arrested have the opportunity to appeal.

    新加坡当局非法捕人危害民主
    马来亚劳工党和新加坡报界同声抗议
    新华社23日讯　新加坡消息：马来亚劳工党10月18日发表声明指责新加坡政府援引驱逐法令和公共安全法令逮捕社会团体工作者、教师和学生。
    马来亚劳工党认为：援引这两个法令逮捕十五个人和封闭三个团体而没有提出证据来进行公开审判，这是不民主和危害人民人身自由的措施。
    这个声明说：“我们要反对的是没有充分证据就逮捕人民和不进行公开审讯。这是一个非常危险的制度，如果不加以阻止的话，就会侵犯到我们日常生活每一方面的自由，使我们听到了靴声就害怕”。
    另外据报纸报道，在新加坡政府大逮捕行动下第一批被扣留的六个人可能在最近被驱逐出境。这六个人在9月18日被捕以后，他们的家属就立刻委托律师向新加坡的部长会议上诉，但是，部长会议却在10月18日没有说明任何理由就驳回了律师的上诉。
    据新华社23日讯　新加坡消息：新加坡报界反对新加坡政府在10月15日和16日连续逮捕两个新闻工作人员谢镛和丘有才。
    新加坡新闻工作者联合会主席拉贾拉特纳姆在10月18日率领这个联合会的十名代表会见了新加坡首席部长林有福，要求政府无条件释放被捕的新闻工作人员，或者提出证据进行公开审讯。
    英文“海峡时报”也在10月19日发表社论说，由于谢镛和丘有才的被捕，已经使新加坡的言论自由事实上陷入危机。“新报”在10月18日发表的一篇评论中要求政府依据民主原则，提出真凭实据，对被捕者进行公开审讯，使被捕者有申诉的机会。
