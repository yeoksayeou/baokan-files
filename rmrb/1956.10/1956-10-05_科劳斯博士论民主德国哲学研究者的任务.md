Dr. Klaus, Director of the Institute of Philosophy at Humboldt University, recently published an article in "Neues Deutschland" entitled: "The Tasks of Philosophy Teaching and Research."

The author first points out that since 1948, the study of Marxist philosophy in German philosophical circles has greatly developed, bringing new elements to German spiritual life. However, there are also many shortcomings in the study of Marxist philosophy. For example, in the teaching and research of philosophy, most of the work is confined to the four characteristics of dialectics and the three characteristics of materialism, and the great treasure trove of philosophical ideas left to us by Marx, Engels, and Lenin has not been properly studied. In recent years, the publication of philosophical works has increased greatly in quantity, but has not reached a corresponding level in quality, and the social importance of the topics selected is also insufficient. The author says: German Marxists have a responsibility to study Kant and Hegel from a Marxist point of view.

The author says that the staff of the Philosophy Department of Humboldt University have discussed the tasks in future philosophical work and the methods to solve these tasks. They believe that there is a lack of a scientifically and carefully compiled work on the basic content of dialectical materialism. Some philosophers say that we should wait for Soviet philosophers to compile such a book. The author says that this is not right, philosophers and philosophical groups in many countries within our camp should participate in this work and work together to compile a work on the basic content of dialectical materialism.

The author points out another task is the issue of logic. He says: Some philosophers have the opinion that the classical writers have already made some criticisms of formal logic, and this problem has basically been solved. Therefore, the development of modern logic is ignored. They only put Marxist quotations and examples in the outdated textbooks of formal logic and publish them as Marxist logic textbooks. This is obviously wrong. Marxist textbooks on formal logic should include modern achievements in logic.

The author emphasizes that "Marxist philosophers face the most urgent task in the history of philosophy. We do not yet have a book that evaluates the philosophy of Kant, Hegel, and Feuerbach from a Marxist point of view, which is our shame. Philosophers should strive to study, for example, Kant's 'Critique of Pure Reason' and Hegel's 'Logic' and write specialized works. It is not enough to simply say that Kant wavered between materialism and idealism, that the 'thing-in-itself' is materialist, and 'transcendentalism' is idealist, just as it is not enough to assert that Hegel's philosophy is an aristocratic reaction to the French Revolution." The author points out that a truly scientific evaluation of classical German philosophy is a major prerequisite for effectively refuting today's reactionary bourgeois idealist theories.

### 科劳斯博士论民主德国哲学研究者的任务

    科劳斯博士论民主德国哲学研究者的任务
    洪保德大学哲学研究院院长科劳斯博士不久以前在“新德意志报”上发表了一篇文章，题为：“哲学讲授和研究的任务”。
    作者首先指出，自1948年以来，德国哲学界对马克思主义哲学的研究工作有很大发展，给德国精神生活带来了新的因素。但是在马克思主义哲学研究工作中也存在不少缺点。如在哲学的教学和研究上大半是拘守于辩证法的四个特征和唯物主义的三个特征，对马克思、恩格斯和列宁所留给我们的伟大的哲学思想宝库并没有好好研究。近年来哲学著作的出版在数量上增加很多，但是在质量上没有达到相应的水平，选题的社会重要性也不够。作者说：德国的马克思主义者有责任以马克思主义的观点来研究康德和黑格尔。
    作者说，洪保德大学哲学院的工作人员曾经讨论了今后哲学工作中的任务和解决这些任务的方法。他们认为缺乏一种科学地仔细地编定出来的辩证唯物主义的基本内容的著作。有些哲学家说，应该等苏联哲学家来编出这样的书。作者说，这是不对的，我们阵营内许多国家的哲学家以及哲学团体都应该参加这个工作，一起努力来编订辩证唯物主义的基本内容的著作。
    作者指出另一个任务是关于逻辑学的问题。他说：若干哲学家有这样的一种意见：认为经典作家关于形式逻辑学已有若干批评，这个问题，基本上已经解决了。因此对于现代逻辑学的发展就忽视了。他们只把马克思主义的引证和举例装在形式逻辑学的过时的教科书的框子里，作为马克思主义逻辑学教科书出版。这显然是不对的。马克思主义的形式逻辑学的教科书应该包括逻辑学的现代的成果。
    作者强调说，“马克思主义的哲学家面对着最迫切的任务是在哲学史方面。我们还没有一本从马克思主义的观点来评价康德、黑格尔和费尔巴哈哲学的书，这是我们的羞耻。哲学家应该努力研究例如康德的‘纯粹理性批判’和黑格尔的‘逻辑学’并写出专门的著述来。如果只一般地说康德动摇在唯物主义和唯心主义之间，‘物自体’是唯物的，‘先验论’是唯心的，这是不够的，正如断定黑格尔的哲学是对于法国革命的一种贵族主义的反动一样地不够。”作者指出，对于古典德国哲学真正科学的评价是有效地驳斥今天反动的资产阶级唯心主义学说的一个重大的先决条件。
