The resolution stipulates that part of the economic planning and budgeting power will be transferred from the central government to local governments. Local governments will take over direct management of some light industrial enterprises, including building materials industries and food industries.

Local health care institutions, primary vocational schools, and local cultural institutions (except those of national significance) will be handed over to local governments for management. Provincial People's Councils, under certain conditions and through certain procedures, can change the economic tasks stipulated by the central government for the province, and can formulate and change quarterly economic plans themselves without violating the national annual plan and without increasing financial expenditures.

In this resolution, the Chairman of the Planning Commission is also entrusted to determine the specific scope of authority of local People's Councils in economic planning and budgeting, etc., in accordance with the provisions of this resolution, with the consent of the Chairman of the Provincial People's Council.

The resolution also stipulates that the various ministries of the government should propose specific plans for transferring enterprises and scopes of authority to local People's Councils within a certain period.

In addition, the resolution also instructs the relevant central authorities to continue studying the issue of further expanding the authority of local People's Councils.
