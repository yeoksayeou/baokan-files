Further Development of the Rural Economy in North Korea
By Wu Xuejun, Director of the Rural Department of "Labor News" of Korea

    The rural areas of North Korea are currently undergoing dramatic changes.
    The process of restoring and developing the rural economy of North Korea in the post-war period can be broadly explained from the following three aspects: First, restoring the agricultural economy that was severely damaged during the war and consolidating the material and technical foundation for agricultural development; second, in order to stabilize the lives of poor farmers, the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government adopted a series of measures to reduce the burden on farmers, thereby encouraging their enthusiasm for increasing production; third, with the rapid recovery of agricultural production, the agricultural collectivization movement has also achieved great development.
    The three-year bloody war in Korea severely damaged the rural economy, which had been rapidly restored and developed after liberation. Vast areas of arable land were destroyed and deserted, irrigation facilities were damaged, the number of draught animals and livestock decreased significantly, and there was an extreme shortage of young and middle-aged labor in rural areas. To understand the extent of the damage, consider the following facts: the number of cattle decreased by about 40%, pigs decreased by about 50%, and almost all reservoirs, all or part of pumping stations and water conservancy facilities were destroyed. The reduction in cattle resulted in a situation where before the war there was an average of about 6 "chongbo" of arable land per head of cattle (note: one "chongbo" is approximately one hectare), while after the war there was only one head of cattle for every 10 "chongbo" or more of arable land.
    Based on the priority development of heavy industry, the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government also attached importance to the development of light industry and agriculture. Especially in the post-war period, the state allocated huge amounts of funds for rural construction.
    We restored the completely destroyed chemical fertilizer factories, added machine cultivation stations, increased the number of tractors, built new and expanded agricultural machinery and tool factories, and restored, built new, and expanded water conservancy and irrigation facilities on a large scale.
    The investment of 3 billion won (Korean currency) in a single water conservancy and irrigation project in the post-war period provides clear evidence of the Party and government's concern for restoring and improving agricultural production.
    As a result, in the two years after the war, i.e., by the first half of 1955, more than 540 large, medium, and small water conservancy and irrigation projects were built, benefiting approximately 50,000 "chongbo" of irrigated area and 80,000 "chongbo" of arable land from natural disasters. This work was carried out on an even larger scale from the second half of 1955 to the first half of 1956. From the second half of last year to before this year's rice transplanting season, 317 state-run water conservancy and irrigation projects and more than 200 privately-run water conservancy and irrigation projects in our country have begun to release water. As a result, the irrigated area increased by approximately 40,400 "chongbo" (of which 20,000 "chongbo" were converted from dry land to paddy fields, and the rest were converted from water-insecure paddy fields and shallow paddy fields to water-secure paddy fields), and 17,800 "chongbo" of arable land were protected from natural disasters. As a result, the irrigated area in our country has increased by about 1.2 times compared to before liberation, accounting for about 76% of the total paddy field area. Only a small portion of water-insecure paddy fields remains in our country.
    In our country with limited arable land, the increase in paddy field area, which can harvest two to three times more grain than dry land, is a significant advancement in agricultural production development.
    While talking about the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government's concern for improving agricultural productivity, it is also necessary to talk about the Party and government's concern for improving the welfare of farmers in the post-war period. Whether during or after the war, the government provided farmers with assistance in terms of seeds, food, and loans, and was constantly concerned with stabilizing the lives of farmers and increasing their enthusiasm for production. In the post-war period, the natural disasters of 1954-1955, coupled with the destruction of the war, brought difficulties to the lives and production of farmers. Considering these circumstances, the Party and government continued to provide loan assistance to farmers, and at the same time formulated a new tax-in-kind law, reducing the tax-in-kind on farmers to stabilize their lives and increase their enthusiasm for production. According to the revised low-rate fixed tax-in-kind, from 1956 onwards, even calculated based on past normal annual production, farmers will gain about 100,000 tons of grain. Arable land reclaimed by farmers themselves with initiative and paddy fields converted from dry land are exempt from tax-in-kind for one to three years depending on the specific circumstances. The tax rate for agricultural production cooperatives is even lower. These measures to improve the welfare of farmers greatly encouraged the patriotic and production-increasing labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers.
    In the post-war period, due to the care and education of the Party, the broad masses of farmers in our country realized that in order to further develop agricultural production, thoroughly eliminate poverty and the roots of exploitation, they must embark on the path of agricultural collectivization proposed by the Party. After the trial implementation stage in 1953-1954, the agricultural collectivization movement entered a climax in 1955-1956. By the end of June this year, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the country reached 14,777, with the number of households joining the cooperatives accounting for 70.6% of the total number of farm households. Among them, advanced cooperatives accounted for 97%. Now, except for newly liberated areas and some individual mountainous areas, agricultural collectivization in our country has been basically completed.
    Through nearly three years of the collectivization movement, farmers in our country have made great progress in agricultural production and political awareness. Now, not only have the members of the cooperatives realized that the only correct path for farmers to become rich and happy is the path of collectivization, but also the farmers outside the cooperatives are gradually realizing this. It can be predicted that in the near future, the remaining individual farmers in our country will also embark on the road of collectivization.
    At the beginning of the collectivization movement, rich peasants accounted for about 0.5% of the farm households in our country. Now, the ground of the rich peasants has been shrinking day by day.
    Under the conditions in our country, agricultural collectivization is an important way to overcome the shortage of labor, livestock, and agricultural implements in rural areas, to develop the potential of agricultural production, and to vigorously promote the gradual implementation of technological innovation in rural areas.
    Before 1955, because agricultural production cooperatives still occupied a secondary position in agricultural production, it was difficult for farmers in our country to carry out timely plowing and sowing. Although we sent tens of thousands of demobilized soldiers and middle school students to work in rural areas, and mobilized hundreds of thousands of social laborers (staff, students, soldiers) to help with seasonal operations in rural areas, this difficulty could not be fundamentally overcome.
    However, this year, because agricultural production cooperatives have accounted for more than 70% of the total number of farm households in the country, and the level of management of the cooperatives has been significantly improved, the situation has changed. From last autumn to this year's rice transplanting season, farmers in our country not only ensured timely spring plowing, sowing, and rice transplanting, but also carried out large-scale water conservancy and irrigation work. Due to changes in climatic conditions, this year's rice transplanting work started 5 to 10 days later than last year, but this work was completed 5 to 10 days earlier than last year nationwide. In the process of farming by farmers in our country, the slogan "Plowing the soil twice before rice transplanting; not weeding, but plowing the soil!" was put forward for the first time this year, and many areas have overfulfilled the task. The emergence of this great miracle, as the members of our agricultural production cooperatives proudly pointed out, "is due to the power exerted by collective labor!"
    1956 will be recorded as a year in which the sowing of crops in rural areas of our country has undergone tremendous changes. With the expansion of paddy field area in rural North Korea, it has become a huge task to improve the yield of dry land that has not yet been converted to paddy fields. Except for a very small part of the cold areas in the north, the climate and soil conditions in our country are very suitable for sowing the high-yield crop of corn. However, under the conditions of the past individual small-peasant economy, it was not possible to plan to expand the corn sowing area. This year, in addition to sowing wheat, nearly half of the dry land was sown with corn, with the sowing area reaching twice that of last year.
    "Corn is the king of grains in dry land," this is already an unshakable belief of the members of agricultural production cooperatives and individual farmers. The members of agricultural production cooperatives are striving to achieve the high-yield target of averaging two tons of corn per "chongbo." If there are no major natural disasters, it is expected that many areas will exceed this target.
    The rural areas of North Korea are welcoming the rapid development of agricultural productivity on the road of socialist transformation of the countryside, in the enthusiasm of the masses of farmers who have already seen the bright today and tomorrow. On the basis of having eliminated the roots of exploitation, today we have sufficient grounds to say that the rural areas of our country will bring about qualitative changes in the field of agricultural production in the near future.
    Due to various difficulties, agricultural production in North Korea has not yet reached the pre-war level. However, the new surge indicates that in one or two years, agricultural production in our country will achieve great development. The Third Congress of the Korean Workers' Party has formulated a grand plan for the development of agriculture in our country, that is, in the final year of the first five-year plan (1961), the grain output of our country will reach three million tons, and our country will be able to achieve self-sufficiency in grain. Now, the farmers of our country are working with full confidence to complete the tasks put forward by the Party and to promote the further development of the agricultural economy. The development of agricultural production in our country and the continuous improvement of farmers' lives are a strong material force for striving to achieve the reunification of the motherland.

    朝鲜农村经济的进一步发展
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”农村部主任　吴学均
    朝鲜农村现在正经历着剧烈的变化。
    战后时期朝鲜农村经济的恢复和发展过程，大体上可从下列三方面来加以说明：首先，恢复在战争中遭到严重破坏的农业经济，巩固农业发展的物质技术基础；其次，为了安定贫苦农民的生活，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府采取了一系列的措施以减轻农民的负担，因而鼓舞了农民的增产热情；再次，随着农业生产的迅速恢复，农业合作化运动也获得了巨大的发展。
    朝鲜的三年流血战争，曾使解放后已经得到迅速恢复和发展的农村经济遭受了严重的损害。广大面积的耕地遭到了破坏与荒芜，灌溉设施遭到了毁损，耕畜、家畜显著地减少，农村青壮年劳动力极度地缺乏。只要想一想这样的事实，就可以理解遭到破坏的程度：耕牛减少了约40％，猪减少了约50％，几乎所有的储水池、全部或部分的扬水场和水利设施遭到了破坏。耕牛的减少造成了这样的情况：战前平均约六町步耕地便有一头耕牛（按：一町步约合一公顷），而战后则十町步以上耕地才有一头耕牛。
    朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府在优先发展重工业的基础上，同时也重视轻工业和农业的发展。特别是战后时期，国家在农村建设方面拨出了巨额资金。
    我们恢复了全被破坏的化学肥料工厂，增设机器代耕站，增加拖拉机的台数，新建和扩建农业机械和农具工厂，大规模地恢复、新建和扩建水利灌溉设施。
    仅就在战后时期投资达三十亿元（朝鲜币）的一个水利灌溉工程来看，就可以找到党和政府关心恢复和提高农业生产的明显证据。
    结果，在战后两年期间，即到1955年上半年，修筑了五百四十多处大、中、小型水利灌溉工程，使约五万町步的灌溉面积和八万町步的耕地免受自然灾害。从1955年下半年起到1956年上半年为止的这一期间，这一工作更是大规模地展开了。从去年下半年起到今年插秧期前为止，我国有三百一十七处国营水利灌溉工程和二百多处民营水利灌溉工程已开始放水。结果就增加了约四万零四百町步的灌溉面积（其中有二万町步是从旱田改成水田，其余的是从水利不安全水田和浅水田改成水利安全水田），有一万七千八百町步的耕地免受自然灾害。结果，我国灌溉面积比解放前约增加了一点二倍，约占水田总面积的76％。我们国家水利不安全的水田只剩下很小的一部分了。
    在耕地有限的我国，能收获相当于旱田二至三倍粮食的水田面积的增加，是农业生产发展中的一个巨大的进展。
    在谈到朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府对提高农业生产力的关心的同时，也有必要谈到党和政府在战后时期对增进农民生活福利的关心。无论在战时或在战后，政府在种籽、食粮和贷款方面都给予农民以帮助，经常关心安定农民的生活和提高他们的生产热情。战后时期，1954—1955年两年的自然灾害，再加上战争的破坏，给农民的生活和生产带来了困难。党和政府考虑到这些情况，对农民继续进行了贷款的帮助，同时制定了新的实物税法，减收农民的实物税，以安定他们生活，提高他们的生产热情。根据修改后低率的固定实物税，从1956年起，就是按过去普通年产量计算，农民也将获得约十万吨粮食的利益。对农民自己发挥积极性所开垦的耕地和由旱田改成的水田，根据其具体情况免收一至三年的实物税。对农业生产合作社征收实物税的税率则更低。这些增进农民福利的措施，大大地鼓舞了广大农民群众爱国增产的劳动热情。
    战后时期，我国广大农民由于受到党的关怀和教育，认识到为了进一步发展农业生产、彻底消除贫困和被剥削的根源，就必须走上党所提出的农业合作化的道路。经过1953—1954年的试行阶段，到1955—1956年，农业合作化运动就进入了高潮。到今年6月底为止，全国农业生产合作社已达一万四千七百七十七个，入社农户占农户总数的70.6％。其中高级社占97％。现在，除新解放区和一些个别山区外，我国的农业合作化已经基本上完成了。
    通过将近三年的合作化运动，我国农民在农业生产方面和政治觉悟方面都有了很大的进展。现在不仅社员体会到农民走向富裕幸福的唯一正确的道路就是合作化的道路，而且合作社外的农民也逐渐认识到这一点。可以预料，不久的将来，我国剩下的个体农民也将走上合作化的大道。
    在合作化运动开始时，我国农户中富农约占0.5％，现在，富农的地盘已经日益缩小了。
    在我国的条件下，农业合作化是克服农村的劳动力、畜力和农具的不足、开发农业生产的潜力和大力促进在农村逐步实行技术革新工作的一个重要的途径。
    在1955年以前，由于农业生产合作社还在农业生产中占次要地位，我国农民要做到及时翻耕和播种还是困难的。虽然我们把几万退伍军人、中学学生派到农村去工作，并动员几十万社会劳动力（职员、学生、军人）帮助农村季节性的作业，但是还不能从根本上克服这一困难。
    可是，到了今年，由于农业生产合作社已占全国总农户70％以上，同时合作社的经营管理水平已显著提高，情况就起了变化。从去年秋天起到今年插秧时为止，我国农民不仅保证了及时的春耕、播种和插秧，而且还进行了大规模的水利灌溉工作。由于气候条件的变动，今年的插秧工作比去年迟5到10天才开始，但是，这项工作在全国范围内却提前5到10天结束。在我国农民耕作的过程中，今年第一次提出了“插秧前翻两次土；不是锄草，而是翻土！”的口号，不少地区还超额完成了任务。这个伟大奇迹的出现，正如我国农业合作社的社员们所骄傲地指出的：“是由于进行集体劳动而发挥的威力！”
    1956年将被记录成为我国农村农作物的播种发生巨大变化的一年。随着朝鲜农村水田面积的扩大，使至今仍未改为水田的旱田的产量也能得到提高，已成为一个巨大的任务。除去北部极小的一部分寒冷地带外，我国的气候和土壤条件是非常适合于播种高产作物玉蜀黍的。可是在过去个体小农经济占优势的条件下，是不能有计划地扩大玉蜀黍的播种面积的。在今年，除去播种麦类以外，将近一半的旱田播种了玉蜀黍，播种面积达到去年的二倍。
    “玉蜀黍是旱田谷食之王”，这已经是农业生产合作社的社员和个体农民不可动摇的信念。农业生产合作社的社员正为达到每町步平均收获玉蜀黍二吨的高产目标而奋斗。如果不遭受巨大的自然灾害，预计有许多地区将会超过这一目标。
    朝鲜的农村在农村社会主义改造的道路上，在已看出了光明的今天和明天的农民群众的热情中，来迎接农业生产力迅速的发展。在已消灭了剥削根源的基础上，今天我们有充分的根据可以说，我国的农村在农业生产领域中，在不久的将来将会引起质的变化。
    朝鲜的农业生产由于各种困难，还没有达到战前的水平。可是新的高涨形势表明，在一两年内，我国农业生产将要获得很大的发展。朝鲜劳动党第三次代表大会为我国农业发展制定了宏伟的计划，即在第一个五年计划的最后一年（1961年），我国的谷物产量将达到三百万吨，我国的粮食将能自给自足。现在，我国农民正满怀信心地为完成党所提出的任务、为促进农业经济的进一步发展而努力。我国农业生产的发展和农民生活的不断改善，是争取实现祖国统一的坚强的物质力量。（本报特约稿）
