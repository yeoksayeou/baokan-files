Xinhua News Agency Report:

Jiangxi Paper Mill purchasing personnel have found seven or eight types of paper substitute materials in Poyang, Pingxiang, and other places, such as bamboo shoot shells, triangular grass, and reed shells, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient raw material supply. The Jiangxi Paper Mill had previously been unable to complete its third-quarter production plan on schedule due to a lack of raw material supply. Later, after research by the factory's leaders, purchasing personnel were dispatched to various places to find and purchase new substitute raw materials for paper making. So far, the substitute raw materials they have purchased are sufficient for use until March of next year.

The fiber of triangular grass is very long and can be made into high-quality paper. Bamboo shoot shells were purchased after the factory learned from the experience of the Hangzhou Paper Mill. Bamboo shoot shells and reed shells, etc., are produced in many places in Jiangxi.

    江西找到造纸代用品
    新华社讯　江西造纸厂采购人员在鄱阳、萍乡等地找到了竹荀壳、三角草、芦茅壳等七、八种造纸代用品，克服了原料供应不足的困难。江西造纸厂曾经因为原料供应不上而影响了第三季度生产计划的不能如期完成。后来，这个厂的领导人员经过研究以后，派出采购人员到各地寻找、收购新的造纸代用原料。到现在为止，他们所收购的代用原料，足可以使用到明年三月间。
    三角草的纤维很长，可以制成高级纸张，质量很好。竹荀壳是这个厂吸取杭州造纸厂的经验以后收购的。竹荀壳和芦茅壳等，江西很多地方都有出产。
