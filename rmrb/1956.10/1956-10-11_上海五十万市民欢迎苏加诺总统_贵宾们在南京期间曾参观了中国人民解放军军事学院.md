As soon as the President's car drove into the gate of the Children's Palace, trumpets and drums immediately sounded. The children lined up on both sides of the road and on the lawn took off their red scarves and waved them above their heads, cheering excitedly.

On the lawn, President Sukarno gave a speech at the invitation of the children. He said: The future of China and the Chinese nation is entirely in your hands. The future of Indonesia and the Indonesian nation is also entirely in the hands of Indonesian youth. You must work hard and study hard. Similarly, the youth of Indonesia must also work hard and study hard.

President Sukarno then said: We work not only for our own country and our own nation but also for the people and peace of the whole world. Gano-Uncle hopes that you will be friendly to the youth of the world, especially to the youth of Indonesia. At this time, the children on the lawn cheered enthusiastically again: "Uncle Gano!"

Speaking to this point, President Sukarno, to express his love for the children, enthusiastically sang two Indonesian songs in Indonesian in front of the microphone. After each song, the children applauded and cheered enthusiastically: "Uncle Gano!" Then, the Young Pioneers presented President Sukarno with a Young Pioneer flag, and the President immediately wrapped it around his neck. The Young Pioneers then presented President Sukarno with a bugle, and the President happily took the bugle and blew it to the children on the lawn. President Sukarno then led his entourage in singing an Indonesian song for the children in Indonesian: "Joyful Indonesia." While singing, President Sukarno smiled and stroked the chin of a child nestled beside him. President Sukarno finally said "Thank you" in Chinese and left the lawn. The children also accompanied the President to visit their radio, aircraft model, shipbuilding, and other interesting extracurricular activities. The children presented the President with gifts they made, such as a "Independence" sailboat model, dolls, and embroidered handkerchiefs. The children's choir also sang an Indonesian song for President Sukarno: "Song of the Coconut Island." President Sukarno happily clapped along with the children and asked them to sing it again. When the children sang it the second time, President Sukarno and his entourage joined in the singing.
