    An Example of Humbly Listening to the Opinions of the Masses
  　Wang Gengxi
    This happened this spring.

    One morning, commune members Li Futai and Ju Shitou rushed into the cooperative's office. Upon seeing Ju Shishan, a Party branch member and director of the cooperative, they immediately asked, "Are we not talking about striving for a bumper harvest this year?" Ju Shishan was caught off guard and asked, "What's wrong?" Li Futai said, "The cooperative has set a plan to strive for a bumper harvest, and the branch also regularly educates everyone to work hard and ensure a bumper harvest. However, leading cadres are not implementing this. How can we achieve a bumper harvest?"

    It turned out that Ju Fengqi, the Party branch secretary, was plowing the land too coarsely, making furrows a foot deep and not leveling them afterward.

    The branch immediately criticized Ju Fengqi for his rough plowing and made him redo it.

    In the Juzhong Cooperative in Guobao Village, Huguan County, Shanxi Province, it has become common for commune members to directly criticize Party member cadres. In the first half of this year, the Party branch and the management committee received more than 80 criticisms and suggestions from commune members.

    Why are the commune members of this cooperative so bold in criticizing Party member cadres? This is the result of the Party branch being able to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses and accept their supervision.

    Of course, not all Party members were able to correctly treat the criticisms of the masses at first. Some Party members often only accepted criticism from the Party and not from the masses. They believed that it was shameful for a Party member to be criticized by the masses. Ju Duishan, a Communist Party member and the captain of the first production team, was such a person. His production team was poorly organized, resulting in wasted labor and time. When commune member Ju Gaiqing criticized him, he not only did not accept it but also scolded Ju Gaiqing. After discovering this situation, the branch conducted a strict criticism of Ju Duishan at the Party's life meeting, pointing out that his behavior of suppressing mass criticism was a violation of Party discipline. Ju Duishan accepted the criticism and even apologized to Ju Gaiqing, which played an important role in encouraging the masses to actively offer criticisms and suggestions on the work of the Party and the leadership style of Party member cadres.

    The Party branch must not only humbly listen to the opinions of the masses but also be good at improving the work of the Party according to the correct opinions of the masses in order to gain the trust of the masses. The Party branch of the Juzhong Cooperative attaches great importance to opinions from the masses. This spring, commune members generally reported that they had no pocket money, and more than 20 households had no salt to eat or coal to burn. Everyone requested the cooperative to find ways to develop sideline production and solve the problem of pocket money. The branch believed that this request from the masses was reasonable and that it should help the masses solve their livelihood problems. After research, the branch helped the cooperative find four sideline production opportunities: selling coal, hauling minerals, delivering eggs to the supply and marketing cooperative, and loading and unloading kilns. It also organized the cooperative's five masons to do odd jobs. In this way, the difficulties of most commune members having no pocket money and some commune members having no salt or coal were resolved.

    Precisely because the Party branch of the Juzhong Cooperative can humbly listen to the opinions of the masses and improve the Party's leadership style according to the opinions of the masses, it has further strengthened the ties between the Party and the masses, and the masses are more concerned about the work of the Party and the collective cause. During the summer hoeing period, the cooperative originally planned to harrow twice and then till the ridges. Commune members Ju Xingfu and Yang Yaobao personally went to the branch secretary and cooperative director to express their opinions, saying that the cooperative's plan had problems. They comprehensively calculated the entire cooperative's work, labor, and time. The result of the plan was that after harrowing twice, it would be the "Beginning of Autumn." Tilling the ridges after the "Beginning of Autumn" would affect the growth of the crops. They proposed that efforts should be concentrated on tilling the ridges first. After research, the branch and the cooperative management committee believed that this opinion was correct and immediately changed the original plan.

    虚心听取群众意见的一例
  　王耕溪
    这还是今年春天的事。
    一天上午，社员李福太和琚石头气冲冲的跑到合作社的办公室里，见了党支部委员、社主任琚石山，劈头就问：“今年叫丰产不叫了？”琚石山一下摸不着头脑，问道：“怎么啦？”李福太说：“社里订出计划要争取丰产哩，支部也经常教育大家要好好干活，保证丰产，可是，领导干部不执行，这怎能丰产？”
    原来是党支部书记琚凤岐，犁地犁的太粗糙，犁沟开下尺把深，不埋平就算完事了。
    支部马上批评了琚凤岐犁地粗糙的现象，并让他返工重做了一遍。
    像社员直接找支部批评党员干部的事情，在山西壶关县郭堡村聚众合作社已经是很平常的事情了。今年前半年，党支部和管理委员会共受理社员的批评建议八十多件。
    为什么这个社的社员敢大胆的对党员干部提出批评呢？这是由于党支部能够虚心听取群众意见，接受群众监督的结果。
    当然，起初也并不是所有党员都能够正确对待群众的批评的。有些党员往往只能接受党的批评而不能接受群众的批评，他们认为一个党员受了群众的批评是很丢脸的事。共产党员、第一生产队队长琚堆山就是这样一个人。他领导的一个生产队，活儿安排的不好、造成窝工浪费，社员琚改清对他提出批评，他不但不接受，反把琚改清训斥了一顿。支部发现这个情况后，在党的生活会上，对琚堆山进行了严格的批评，指出他这种压制群众批评的行为是违反党的纪律的。琚堆山接受了批评，还主动向琚改清道歉，这对鼓励群众积极对党的工作以及党员干部的领导作风提出批评建议，起了重要的作用。
    党支部不只要虚心听取群众意见，而且还必须善于按照群众的正确意见来改进党的工作，才能得到群众的信任。聚众合作社党支部对来自群众中的意见是很重视的。今年春天，社员普遍反映没有零花钱，有二十多户没盐吃、没煤烧，大家要求社里想办法给找副业生产门路，解决零花钱问题。支部认为群众的这个要求是合理的，应当帮助群众解决生活问题。经过研究，支部就帮助社里找出了卖煤、拉矿、给供销社送鸡蛋，装窑出窑等四项副业生产门路，还把社里的五个泥水匠组织起来做零工。这样，就解决了多数社员没零花钱和部分社员没盐没煤的困难。
    正因为聚众合作社党支部能够虚心听取群众意见，并按照群众的意见来改进党的领导作风，因而进一步密切了党和群众的联系，群众对党的工作、对集体的事业更加关心了。夏锄期间，社里原布置先拉二遍后耧圪堆，社员琚兴甫、杨咬保便亲自来找支部书记和社主任提出意见，说社里的计划有问题，他们把全社的活儿、劳力和时间全面计算了一下，计划的结果，拉完二遍就到了“立秋”，“立秋”以后再耧堆，就会影响庄稼的生长，他们提出应当先集中力量耧圪堆。支部和社管理委员会经过研究，认为这个意见是正确的，就立即改变了原来的计划。
