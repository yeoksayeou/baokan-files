Story of Mr. Sun Yat-sen Burning Opium in Anqing
	Old Tongmenghui Member Liu Tianqiu
	In 1912, after Mr. Sun Yat-sen relinquished his position as Provisional President to Yuan Shikai, he served as the Director-General of Railways for the whole country and resided in Shanghai. At that time, the Military Governor and Provincial Governor of Anhui was Bai Wenwei, and the Chief of the Anhui Police Department was Qi Genghuan. One evening, the Anqing South Gate Water Police seized a large batch of prohibited opium on a merchant ship belonging to the British firm Taikoo Dockyard Company. Qi Genghuan immediately ordered its detention and reported it to the governor for handling. The next day, the British Consul stationed in Anhui Province lodged a strong protest, demanding that the original goods be returned in full within twenty-four hours and an apology be made to the shipping company; at the same time, the British gunboat anchored in the heart of the river removed its gun covers and aimed directly at the South Gate tower, making a great show of threat.
	While deliberating on countermeasures, a quick telegram arrived from Wuhu: Mr. Sun Yat-sen was traveling to Wuhan from Shanghai on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Jiangkuan" ship, had arrived in Wuhu, and would arrive in Anqing at one o'clock in the afternoon. Bai Wenwei took a speedboat to meet him halfway and asked Mr. Sun Yat-sen for instructions on how to handle the unreasonable actions of the British Consul. At this time, great panic broke out in Anqing city. Rumors spread that the military governor had fled, that the British warships were about to open fire, and that most of the staff of the Governor's Office and the Administrative Office, except for a few clerks, were staying at home, afraid to go to work, as if they were in imminent danger.
	At twelve noon, the speedboat returned with a report: Bai Wenwei was accompanying Mr. Sun Yat-sen and was about to go ashore to give a speech. Qi Genghuan personally led the police department staff to make urgent arrangements, building a high platform outside the South Gate and piling the confiscated opium on the riverbank, setting up dry firewood, and sprinkling it with gasoline in preparation for burning it. For a time, nearly ten thousand people from far and near came uninvited upon hearing the news. Men and women, old and young, stood shoulder to shoulder on both sides of the Yangtze River, quietly waiting for Mr. Sun Yat-sen to arrive.
	Around one o'clock in the afternoon, the "Jiangkuan" ship arrived at the port, military music played loudly, and the crowd cheered. Bai Wenwei accompanied Mr. Sun Yat-sen to the platform to give a speech. Mr. Sun's voice was loud and his speech was impassioned. He recounted the means of colonial policies adopted by the imperialists since the Opium War and the opening of five ports for trade, seizing the interests of the Chinese people, and transporting poisons to harm compatriots for seventy years. During the speech, the British gunboat in the river began to fire, and the masses thought it was preparing to open fire. But seeing Mr. Sun Yat-sen's expression unchanged, his energy grew more vigorous, and his voice grew louder, his mournful words poured out like a river, moving everyone and increasing their courage.
	As soon as the speech was over, at a command, Qi Genghuan supervised the police officers to immediately set fire to all the opium piled on the riverbank and burned it in public. At this time, the audience on both sides of the river shook the ground, applause thundered, flames flashed, and smoke filled the sky. In an instant, the British gunboat had turned its hull, opened full throttle, and fled downstream. The masses were even more excited when they saw this, and the storm of applause and angry scolding lasted for a long time. It was four o'clock in the afternoon. Mr. Sun Yat-sen waved goodbye to the masses, returned to the "Jiangkuan" ship amidst the melodious military music and the cheers of the masses, and steamed westward. A great storm came to an abrupt end. That evening, the smell of opium smoke spread for several miles, and it did not dissipate until morning. Everyone who heard about it praised it. At that time, the secretary of the Governor's Office had four quatrains to sigh about this matter, and I only remember the first one, which goes like this:
	For a hundred years, we have looked forward from afar, now a torch burns the poison again; ten thousand people on both banks clap their hands in unison, laughing as they watch the enemy ship flee in alarm. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中山先生在安庆烧鸦片烟的故事
    老同盟会会员　刘天囚
    1912年，中山先生把临时大总统的职位让与袁世凯以后，任全国铁路总监，驻在上海。当时安徽都督兼省长是柏文蔚，安徽警察厅厅长是祁耿寰。一天傍晚，安庆南门城外水上警察查获英商太古轮船公司某商轮上载有大批违禁的鸦片，祁耿寰即令扣留，报告省长处理。次日，驻安徽省英国领事提出严重抗议，限于二十四小时内将原货如数送还，并向该轮船公司道歉；同时停泊江心的英国炮舰卸去炮衣，并对准南门城楼，大肆威胁。
    正在筹议对策的时候，适接芜湖快电：中山先生由上海乘招商局“江宽号”轮船赴汉，已抵芜湖，将于午后一时到达安庆。柏文蔚乘快艇往中途迎迓，并将英领事这种无理举动，面向中山先生请示办理。这时，安庆城内发生极大恐慌，谣传都督已逃，英舰即将开炮，都督府和行政公署办公人员除少数职员外，大都呆在家里，迟迟不敢上班，大有岌岌不可终日之势。
    正午十二时，快艇驶回报告：柏文蔚陪同中山先生即将登岸演讲。祁耿寰亲率警厅人员急忙布置，在南门城外高搭讲台，并将所扣鸦片烟土堆积江岸，架了干柴，洒满汽油，准备焚毁。一时远近群众闻此消息不约而来的约近万人，长江两岸，男女老少，挨肩叠背，静立江岸，等候中山先生莅临。
    午后一时左右，“江宽”号轮船抵埠，军乐大作，万众欢呼，柏文蔚陪同中山先生登台演说。先生嗓音宏亮，慷慨激昂，历述鸦片战争、五口通商以来，帝国主义者所采取的殖民政策的手段，侵夺中国人民的利益，并贩运毒物，残害同胞七十年的事实。当演讲时，江中英国炮舰就开始升火，群众以为它将准备开炮。但见中山先生神色不动，精力愈奋，嗓音愈高，沉痛之词如倾河倒峡，滔滔不绝，莫不为之感动，顿时增加了勇气。
    演讲刚完，一声号令，祁耿寰督率警员将所有堆积江岸的鸦片烟土立即举火，当众焚毁。这时，两岸观众山摇地动，掌声如雷，火光闪耀，烟雾漫空，一转瞬间，英国炮舰已调转轮身，开足马力，急向下游遁去。群众看见，尤为兴奋，暴风雨般的掌声和怒叱声经久不息。时已午后四时，中山先生向群众挥手告别，在军乐悠扬声中和群众欢送声中，仍返“江宽”船中，鼓轮西上。一场绝大风波，遂戛然而止。是夕鸦片烟臭味传达数里，经晨始灭，远近闻之，无不称快。当时都督府秘书曾有诗四绝，咏叹此事，现在只记得开头一绝是这样的：
    百年相望正遥遥，一炬重将毒物烧；夹岸万人齐抚掌，笑看敌舰已惊逃。　（新华社）
