    An Astonishingly Despicable Incident
    At a time when the Suez issue is heading towards a peaceful resolution, a swift end to the Algerian war through negotiations has become an urgent demand of Arab nations and people worldwide. Following contacts with the French government, Moroccan Sultan Yusuf and Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba invited Algerian national leaders to hold talks to seek ways to end the Algerian war. This peaceful endeavor should be sponsored and supported. But unexpectedly, the Algerian national leaders, while traveling by plane to attend the talks, were kidnapped by the French authorities in Algeria and thrown into prison. This is a despicable act of deliberately sabotaging the peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue, which cannot but arouse great indignation among all peace-loving people.
    For two years, the Algerian people, in order to achieve national independence, have been heroically resisting the cruel suppression of the French colonialists while advocating for a peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue through negotiations, based on respect for Algeria's independent sovereignty. This just and peaceful stance has received widespread support from Asian and African countries and people all over the world.
    Because the colonial war waged by France in Algeria seriously threatens peace in the region and the world, the United Nations has repeatedly discussed the Algerian issue at the request of Asian and African countries. In August of this year, Prime Minister Nehru put forward a reasonable proposal of six principles for a peaceful solution to this issue. Morocco and Tunisia have the closest interests in a peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue, and therefore, after achieving national independence, they actively worked to end the Algerian war. Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba once pointed out: "Peace in North Africa is indivisible," and "Now is the appropriate time to recognize Algeria's demand for independence." Recently, this renewed peaceful effort by the two countries received support from Algerian national leaders and all sectors of French society. At a time when the opportunity for seeking a peaceful resolution has matured, the French government stubbornly adheres to the policy of armed suppression, doing its utmost to undermine all efforts to peacefully resolve the Algerian issue.
    However, France's insistence on adopting this outdated policy is bound to fail. Despite its exhaustive efforts to increase military appropriations, mobilize hundreds of thousands of troops to strengthen suppression, and carry out massacres, it cannot weaken the Algerian people's armed resistance; on the contrary, it only plunges itself deeper into difficulties. In the recent debates on the Algerian issue in the French parliament, members of parliament from the Communist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Republican Union of Progress fiercely opposed the continued implementation of armed suppression and demanded a peaceful resolution. At the same time, calls for a peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue are growing louder and louder in France. In order to cope with this increasingly unfavorable situation, the French government has had to repeatedly state verbally that it does not reject peace talks. However, in action, it has not taken any steps conducive to a peaceful resolution; on the contrary, it is still trying to force the Algerian people to give up their struggle for independence. This completely unrealistic attempt will certainly not succeed.
    The era in which colonialists could continue to suppress national independence movements by force has gone forever. France's inability to avoid recognizing the independence of the three Indochinese states, Morocco, and Tunisia should be a lesson to France. The victory of the Egyptian people's struggle to reclaim the Suez Canal should be another lesson to France. The French authorities in Algeria think that using such despicable means, unacceptable under international norms, kidnapping Algerian national leaders, and undermining efforts to seek a peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue will benefit them. It can be said that they have fallen into an astonishing state of delusion! This despicable act can only arouse stronger resistance from the Algerian people and strong condemnation from world public opinion. Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba warned that the arrest of Algerian national leaders may force the entire North Africa to contend with France. This is a powerful warning. The Algerian people and Arab countries, united in seeking a peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue based on respect for Algeria's independent sovereignty, with the support of peace-loving people in all countries of the world, will certainly be able to defeat attempts at armed suppression and the sabotaging of peaceful resolution. Now, all those concerned about the situation in Algeria are paying attention to what attitude the French government will take.

### 一个惊人的卑鄙事件

    一个惊人的卑鄙事件
    在苏伊士问题导向和平解决的时候，迅速以谈判方式结束阿尔及利亚的战争，已成为阿拉伯国家和全世界人民的迫切要求了。摩洛哥苏丹优素福和突尼斯首相布尔吉巴在同法国政府进行了接触以后，邀请阿尔及利亚民族领袖举行会谈，寻求结束阿尔及利亚战争的途径。这种和平努力是应该得到赞助和支持的。但出乎意料之外的是，阿尔及利亚民族领袖在乘飞机参加会谈途中，竟遭到阿尔及利亚法国当局的绑架，被投入监狱。这是一个蓄意破坏阿尔及利亚问题和平解决的卑鄙手段，这不能不引起所有爱好和平人民的极大愤慨。
    两年来，阿尔及利亚人民为了争取民族独立，一面英勇地反抗法国殖民主义者的残酷镇压，一面主张以谈判方式谋求在尊重阿尔及利亚的独立主权的基础上，和平解决阿尔及利亚问题。这个正义的和平的立场，得到了亚非国家和全世界人民的普遍支持。
    由于法国在阿尔及利亚进行的殖民战争，严重地威胁到这一地区和世界的和平，因此，在亚非国家的要求下，联合国曾一再讨论了阿尔及利亚问题。今年8月，尼赫鲁总理提出了和平解决这个问题的六项原则的合理建议。摩洛哥和突尼斯对阿尔及利亚问题和平解决有着最密切的利益，因而它们在取得了民族独立以后，就积极为结束阿尔及利亚战争而奔走。突尼斯首相布尔吉巴曾指出：“北非的和平是不可分割的”，“现在是承认阿尔及利亚独立要求的适当时机了。”最近，这两个国家所进行的再一次和平努力，得到了阿尔及利亚民族领袖和法国各阶层的支持。在谋求和平解决的时机已经成熟的情况下，法国政府却仍固执武力镇压政策，竭力破坏和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的一切努力。
    可是，法国坚持采取这种过时了的政策，是一定要失败的。尽管它罗掘俱穷地增加军事拨款，调集十几万军事部队加强镇压，大肆屠杀，却不能削弱阿尔及利亚人民的武装反抗，反而使它自己更加陷于困境。最近在法国议会对阿尔及利亚问题的辩论中，共产党、激进社会党和进步共和联盟等议员都激烈地反对继续实行武力镇压，要求和平解决。同时要求和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的呼声，在法国国内是愈来愈响亮了。为了应付这种愈来愈不利的局面，法国政府不得不在口头上一再表示不拒绝和谈。可是，在行动上不但没有采取任何有助于和平解决的步骤，相反地却仍力图迫使阿尔及利亚人民放弃争取独立的斗争。这个完全不现实的企图当然是不会得逞的。
    殖民主义者能够凭借武力继续镇压民族独立运动的时代已经一去不复返了。法国不能不承认印度支那三国、摩洛哥和突尼斯的独立，对法国应该是一个教训。埃及人民收回苏伊士运河的斗争取得的胜利，对法国应该是又一个教训。阿尔及利亚法国当局以为使用这种国际行为准则所不容许的卑鄙手法，绑架阿尔及利亚民族领袖，破坏谋求和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的努力，会使自己得到什么好处。他们可说已昏迷到了惊人的程度！这种为人所不齿的行径，只能引起阿尔及利亚人民更强烈的反抗，引起世界公众舆论的强烈谴责。突尼斯首相布尔吉巴警告说：逮捕阿尔及利亚民族领袖可能迫使整个北非同法国较量力量。这是有力的警告。阿尔及利亚人民和阿拉伯国家团结一致地谋求阿尔及利亚问题在尊重阿尔及利亚的独立主权基础上的和平解决的努力，在全世界爱好和平的各国人民的支持下，一定能够击败武力镇压和破坏和平解决的企图。现在一切关心着阿尔及利亚局势的人们，都注意着法国政府究竟采取什么态度。
