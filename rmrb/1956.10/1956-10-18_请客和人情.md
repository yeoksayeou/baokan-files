Treating Guests and Human Relationships
　　Cai Xiyi
The Party secretaries and directors of the Tongguanshan Mining Bureau all love to eat well, and they indulge in heavy drinking and eating. For example, at a banquet in February of this year, they set up 56 tables, but there were fewer than 200 guests, while there were more than 250 people accompanying them. They ate 513 catties of pork, 218 packs of Zhonghua cigarettes, 35 packs of Qianmen cigarettes, drank 69 catties of liquor, 25 bottles of brandy, sweet wine, Wujiapi and other fine wines, and other snacks, melon seeds, fruits... They couldn't finish it all! This cost a total of 1,385 yuan, equivalent to the price of more than 12,000 catties of rice. Because they love to eat, they have to find ways and opportunities. As the old saying goes, "Nothing is difficult in the world if you put your heart into it." They finally found an excuse to eat. March 8th Women's Day, Youth Day, League Congress, Party Congress, Women Workers' Representative Conference, Awards Ceremony... are all good opportunities. Welcoming new arrivals and sending off those leaving, guests coming to visit, reporters coming to interview... they can't let any of these go. Sometimes, after eating and drinking, they also watch operas, movies, and circuses. Anyway, the money has already been spent, so they must enjoy themselves to the fullest.

Needless to say, the money spent is naturally public money. Because if they were to treat guests with their own money, even the most hospitable person couldn't do it so often, on such a large scale, or enjoy it so much. Since it is spending public money, it must be reimbursed. Sometimes, when reimbursement is not so smooth, Comrade Jing Dianmo, the Party Secretary, would sigh endlessly and say: "Money is valued, human relationships are thin!"

In the old society, the exploiting classes indeed measured the thickness of human relationships by treating people to food and drink. Our revolutionary ranks also value human relationships, but it is not expressed in delicacies and fine wines, but in mutual care and assistance in work, study, and life. As a leader of an enterprise, if you really value human relationships, then, for a comrade who has just come to work, the greatest kindness is to help him understand the work situation and create good working conditions for him; for a journalist, the greatest kindness is to introduce the situation to him without reservation and help him solve the difficulties in the interview; for a comrade who is about to be transferred to work elsewhere, the greatest kindness is to point out his strengths and weaknesses truthfully. This is the kind of human relationship we revolutionaries need. Abandoning these tasks and only talking about eating, drinking, and finding entertainment is not human relationship, but wasting state resources and benefiting oneself at public expense.

    请客和人情
    蔡希义
    铜官山矿务局的党委书记和局长们都好吃，而且是痛痛快快地大喝大吃。如今年2月份的一次宴会，摆酒席五十六桌，客人不足二百，陪客的倒有二百五十多人，吃猪肉五百十三斤，中华烟二百十八包，前门烟三十五包，喝烧酒六十九斤，白兰地、思美味、五加皮等上等酒二十五瓶，其他点心、瓜子、水果……吃不完！这次共花了一千三百八十五元，相当于一万二千多斤大米的价钱。因为好吃，就得找窍门，找机会。古语说得好：“天下无难事，只怕有心人”，他们终于找到了吃的借口。三八妇女节、青年节、团代会、党代会、女工代表会、发奖会……都是好机会。迎新送旧、客人来参观，记者来采访……也不能放过。有时候，吃喝之后，还要看戏，看电影，看马戏。反正钱已经花了，必须痛快一番。
    不用说明，花的当然是公家钱。因为花自己钱请客，即使是最好客的人，次数也不能那末多，规模也不能那末大，也不会那末痛快。既然是花公家钱，就得报销。有时报销不那末顺利的时候，党委书记荆典谟同志就无限感叹地说：“金钱为重，人情菲薄！”
    在旧社会里，剥削阶级确实是以请吃喝来衡量人情的厚薄的。我们革命队伍也讲究人情，但不是表现在佳肴美酒上面，而是表现在工作上、学习上、生活上要互相关心，互相帮助。作为一个企业的领导人，要是真的讲人情的话，那末，对于新来工作的同志，最厚的人情就是帮助他了解工作情况，给他创造良好的工作条件；对于新闻记者，最厚的人情就是毫无保留地给他介绍情况，帮助他解决采访中的困难；对于一位将要调到别处去工作的同志，最厚的人情，就是实事求是地指出他的优点和缺点。这是我们革命者所需要的人情。抛弃这些工作不做，光讲吃喝，找娱乐，绝不是人情，而是浪费国家资财，是以公济私。
