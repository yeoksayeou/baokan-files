    Paths to Peaceful Negotiations Must Be Sought
    The United Nations Security Council is discussing the Suez Canal issue. World public opinion demands that the Security Council, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, find a suitable way to peacefully resolve the Suez Canal issue on the basis of respecting Egypt's sovereignty.
    Judging from the debates that have already taken place in the Security Council, one thing is very clear: whether the Security Council's discussions can achieve positive results will depend on whether the United Kingdom, France, and the United States have the sincerity to resolve the issue peacefully, and whether they can, not just verbally but in action, abide by the principles of the United Nations Charter, respect Egypt's sovereignty and dignity, and abandon any intention of threatening the use of force.
    The calm and conciliatory speech made by Egyptian representative Fawzi in the Security Council fully demonstrates Egypt's sincerity in seeking a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue. This is entirely consistent with the attitude taken by the Egyptian government since reclaiming the Suez Canal Company. Egypt advocates the establishment of a committee to achieve, through negotiations, the fundamental principle of guaranteeing freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal for all countries. The Soviet representative also insisted in the Security Council on resolving the dispute through consultations on an equal basis, and put forward several principles as the basis for an agreement. The Soviet Union also suggested the establishment of a consultation committee with the participation of Egypt, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, India, and other countries to study the Suez Canal issue. The proposals of the Egyptian and Soviet representatives, on the one hand, insisted on respect for Egyptian sovereignty, and on the other hand, safeguarded the freedom of navigation of the canal user states. They received a good response in the Security Council. The speech of the Yugoslav representative also called for peaceful negotiations and supported the specific proposals of the Soviet Union. The Iranian representative also expressed no objection to the constructive suggestions of the Soviet Union. Obviously, on the basis of the proposals of Egypt and the Soviet Union, a path to the peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue is not difficult to find. No wonder the speeches of the two of them earned enthusiastic applause from the audience in the Security Council chamber.
    However, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States adopted a completely opposite attitude in the Security Council. The United Kingdom and France put forward a joint proposal at the beginning of the meeting. Although this proposal also mentioned conducting negotiations, it did not put forward any constructive suggestions that could promote peaceful negotiations. On the contrary, it still attempted to use the Security Council to put pressure on Egypt, forcing Egypt to accept the so-called "Eighteen-Nation Proposal," which openly violated Egyptian sovereignty, and which was the "Dulles Plan" that had already been rejected by Egypt. The representatives of the United Kingdom and France did their best in their speeches to distort the truth about the Suez Canal issue, clamoring that Egypt was "endangering international peace and security." Their speeches were nothing more than wanting the Security Council to approve the colonial countries' actions of infringing upon Egyptian sovereignty. Although the United States deliberately exaggerated the so-called "differences" with the United Kingdom and France before the Security Council meeting, attempting to portray itself as if it were not a colonialist, the United States still unsurprisingly supported the joint proposal of the United Kingdom and France to infringe upon Egyptian sovereignty.
    The representatives of Egypt, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia rightly criticized the unreasonable position of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, and exposed the true purpose of the joint proposal of the United Kingdom and France. Iranian representative Abdoh also opposed discussing the proposals of the United Kingdom and France in the "current stage." It is very clear that if the United Kingdom, France, and the United States stubbornly adhere to their current unreasonable position, then it is difficult to imagine that the Security Council will be able to make any contribution to promoting the peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue. It should be pointed out that the attempt of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States to use the Security Council to achieve their goal of infringing upon Egyptian sovereignty will not gain them anything except to put them in an increasingly inextricable predicament and make them more morally and politically isolated.
    The United Nations Security Council bears great responsibility for maintaining international peace and respecting the sovereignty of all independent countries. In order for the United Nations to avoid losing its authority due to its inability to peacefully resolve the Suez Canal issue, it must act in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and seek paths to peaceful resolution on the basis of the proposals of Egypt and the Soviet Union. The actions of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, as permanent members of the Security Council, are fundamentally incompatible with the principles of the United Nations Charter. The Security Council should severely condemn their actions of infringing upon the sovereignty of other countries and threatening international peace, immediately stop their threats of force, and bring them to the path of peaceful consultation.

### 必须寻求和平谈判的途径

    必须寻求和平谈判的途径
    联合国安全理事会正在讨论苏伊士运河问题。世界舆论要求安全理事会根据联合国宪章原则，在尊重埃及主权的基础上找出一条和平解决苏伊士运河问题的适当途径。
    从已经在安全理事会进行的辩论情况看来，有一点是很清楚的，这就是安全理事会的讨论能否得到积极的结果，将取决于英、法、美三国是否具有和平解决问题的诚意，是否能够不是在口头上而是在行动上遵守联合国宪章原则，尊重埃及的主权和尊严，放弃武力威胁的任何打算。
    埃及代表法齐在安全理事会上所作的冷静的充满和解精神的发言，充分表明埃及有诚意谋求苏伊士运河问题的和平解决。这同埃及政府从收回苏伊士运河公司以来所采取的态度是完全一致的。埃及主张设立一个委员会，通过谈判来实现对一切国家保证苏伊士运河航行自由的基本原则。苏联代表也在安全理事会上坚持通过在平等基础上的协商来解决争端，并且提出了作为协议基础的若干原则，苏联还建议成立一个有埃及以及美、英、法、苏、印度等国家参加的协商委员会，来研究苏伊士运河问题。埃及和苏联代表的主张，一方面坚持了对埃及主权的尊重，另一方面又维护了运河使用国的通航自由。它们在安全理事会上得到了良好的反应。南斯拉夫代表的发言同样要求举行和平谈判，并支持苏联的具体建议。伊朗代表也表示不反对苏联的建设性的建议。显然，在埃及和苏联建议的基础上，和平解决苏伊士运河问题的途径是不难找到的。无怪乎他们两人的发言都博得了安全理事会旁听席上的热烈的掌声。
    但是，英、法、美三国在安全理事会上却采取了完全相反的态度。英、法两国在会议一开始就提出了一个联合提案。这个提案虽然也说要进行谈判，但是没有提出任何足以促成和平谈判的建设性的建议，相反地却仍然企图利用安全理事会来对埃及施加压力，迫使埃及接受公开侵犯埃及主权的所谓“十八国建议”，也就是早被埃及拒绝了的“杜勒斯计划”。英国和法国的代表在他们的发言中竭力歪曲苏伊士运河问题的真相，叫嚷埃及“危害国际和平和安全”。他们的发言，不过是想要安全理事会批准殖民国家侵犯埃及主权的行动。美国虽然在安全理事会开会以前故意渲染同英、法之间的所谓“分歧”，企图把自己说得好像不是殖民主义者，但是美国仍然不出所料地支持英、法的侵犯埃及主权的联合提案。
    埃及、苏联和南斯拉夫的代表正当地抨击了英、法、美的无理立场，揭露了英、法联合提案的真正目的。伊朗代表阿卜杜也反对在“目前阶段”讨论英、法的提案。十分明显，如果英、法、美三国顽固地坚持目前的无理立场，那末，很难想像安全理事会能够在促成苏伊士运河问题的和平解决上作出什么贡献。应当指出，英、法、美三国企图利用安全理事会来达到它们侵犯埃及主权的目的的这种作法，除了使它们陷于越来越不能自拔的困境并在道义上和政治上更加孤立以外，是什么东西也得不到的。
    在维护国际和平和尊重各独立国家主权的问题上，联合国安全理事会负有极大的责任。联合国要使自己不至于因为在和平解决苏伊士运河问题上无能为力而丧失权威，就必须按照联合国宪章的原则办事，在埃及和苏联建议的基础上寻求和平解决的途径。身为安全理事会常任理事国的英、法、美三国的行动，是同联合国宪章的原则根本不相容的，安全理事会应该对它们的侵犯别国主权、威胁国际和平的行为予以严厉的谴责，立即制止它们的武力威胁，使它们走到和平协商的道路上来。
