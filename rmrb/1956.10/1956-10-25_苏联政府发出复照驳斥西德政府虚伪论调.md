Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 23rd (TASS): On October 22nd, the Soviet government, in a note to the government of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), replied to a note and a memorandum submitted by the West German government to the Soviet government on September 7th, outlining West Germany's views on the issue of German reunification.

The note refuted the West German government's memorandum's attempt to blame the prolonged failure to resolve the German question on the Soviet Union, asserting that this claim was completely unfounded. The note stated: The Soviet Union has been, and will continue to be, a steadfast supporter of the restoration of Germany's national unity, making it a peaceful and democratic nation. However, in assessing the feasibility of achieving this goal, it is necessary to consider the reality that has already taken shape in Germany. Due to the existence of two states and two different social systems in Germany, the only realistic solution to the German reunification issue at present is to conduct negotiations between the two Germanies.

The Soviet Union, which maintains diplomatic relations with both Germanies, is willing to facilitate the necessary agreements between them. The Soviet government is convinced that if the governments of the United States, Great Britain, and France also assist the Federal Republic of Germany in rapprochement with the German Democratic Republic, this would greatly improve the prospects for resolving the German question.

The note stated: The issue of restoring German unity now is primarily a matter of changing the West German government's policy of turning West Germany into a source of new war in Europe, and primarily a matter of rapprochement and reaching agreements between the two Germanies.

The note, addressing West Germany's unrealistic position of attempting to deny the existence of the German Democratic Republic, pointed out that taking such a stance, if not completely disinterested in German reunification, amounts to intending to achieve German unity through violent aggression, which would have dangerous consequences for European peace and, above all, for the German people themselves.

The note, in response to the West German government's emphasis on the four powers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, and France bearing full responsibility for restoring German unity, pointed out: Due to the unilateral actions taken by the United States, Great Britain, and France, which led to the division of Germany and undermined the most important agreement of the four powers on developing Germany into a unified, peaceful, and democratic state, raising the issue in this way no longer has any practical significance.

The note emphasized that the signing of the Paris Agreements and West Germany's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union have seriously damaged the cause of restoring German unity.

The West German government attempts to defend its policy of militarization and its participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by portraying this policy as being for "self-defense." However, the West German Federal Defense Forces currently being established are, in reality, an integral part of the armed forces of an exclusive Western military bloc, whose purpose is to oppose the Soviet Union and peace-loving countries friendly to the Soviet Union.

The note stated: The Soviet Union has consistently opposed, and will continue to oppose, the revival of West German militarism, regardless of the form it takes. The note condemned the West German government for announcing its intention to establish an army of 500,000 men, refusing to discuss any proposals for limiting the armed forces of the two Germanies, and insisting on implementing universal conscription, creating the prerequisites for the development of an army of several million, at a time when major powers are seeking to reach universal disarmament and many countries have already taken practical steps towards disarmament.

The note stated: Due to the fact that two different states have been established on German territory, and that one of them—the Federal Republic of Germany—has joined the North Atlantic Treaty and has begun to implement a policy of militarization and suppression of the democratic rights of the West German people, the notion of unifying Germany through all-German popular elections no longer has a realistic basis. There are currently no conditions in Germany to hold such elections.

The note, in addressing the West German government's mention of establishing a European collective security system, stated: The participation of the two Germanies that currently exist in collective measures to ensure pan-European security would not only greatly facilitate the practical solution of the European security issue but also remove many obstacles on the road to restoring German national unity.

The Soviet government believes that the West German government's proposal to establish a demilitarized zone between East and West in Europe may be worthy of attention under certain circumstances. Unfortunately, this proposal was made merely to once again cover up plans that provide for all of Germany to join the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization. As for the West German government's claim that the disarmament issue can only be resolved simultaneously with the German unification issue, this actually creates more difficulties and makes it impossible to resolve either issue. Regarding the West German government's declaration that it is prepared to undertake an obligation not to use force against European countries that are not members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union, the note asked the West German government to clarify whether the aforementioned declaration means that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany intends to sign corresponding agreements with the countries concerned on this issue.

The note concluded by pointing out that the current relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany are unsatisfactory. Although delegations from the Soviet and West German governments reached a definite agreement in Moscow on developing trade between the two countries, the two countries have not yet held negotiations on this issue. The issue of repatriating Soviet citizens stranded in West Germany has also not been resolved satisfactorily.

The note stated: The Soviet government believes that it would be best for the West German and Soviet governments to engage in further exchanges of views on the issue of relations between the two countries. At the same time, the Soviet government still believes that developing normal relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany will also help resolve the issue of restoring German unity.

    苏联政府发出复照驳斥西德政府虚伪论调
    指出现在恢复德国统一首先要西德改变重新军国主义化的政策，由两个德国之间进行谈判谋求协议
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科23日讯：10月22日，苏联政府在一份致德意志联邦共和国（西德）政府的照会中，答复了西德政府在今年9月7日交给苏联政府的一份照会和一份陈述西德政府对恢复德国统一问题的观点的备忘录。
    照会驳斥了西德政府备忘录企图把德国问题的迟迟不能解决归咎于苏联的说法，指出这种说法是完全没有根据的。照会说：苏联过去是，今后也还将始终不变地支持恢复德国的国家统一，使它成为一个和平的和民主的国家。但是在估计达到这个目的的可能性的时候，必须考虑实际上在德国已经形成的局面。由于在德国存在着两个国家和两种不同的社会制度，目前解决德国统一问题的唯一现实办法就是两个德国之间进行谈判。
    同两个德国都保持着外交关系的苏联，愿意促成它们之间取得必要的协议。苏联政府确信，如果美国、英国和法国政府也协助德意志联邦共和国同德意志民主共和国相互接近，那么这就会大大地改善解决德国问题的前途。
    照会说：现在恢复德国统一的问题，首先是改变西德政府把西德变为欧洲新战争策源地的政策的问题，首先是两个德国的接近和达成协议的问题。
    照会在谈到西德政府企图抹杀德意志民主共和国的存在这种不现实的立场时指出，采取这种立场如果不是完全不关心德国的统一，就是打算通过暴力侵略方式来实现德国的统一，这会给欧洲和平，首先是德国人民自己带来危险的后果。
    照会针对着西德政府强调苏、美、英、法四大国承担着恢复德国统一的全部责任这一点指出：由于美、英、法三国采取了使德国遭到分裂的片面行动而破坏了四大国关于使德国发展成为统一的和平的和民主的国家的最重要的协定，现在这样提出问题已经没有什么现实意义。
    照会强调指出，巴黎协定的签订和西德的加入北大西洋集团和西欧联盟严重地损害了恢复德国统一的事业。
    西德政府企图为自己的军国主义化政策和参加北大西洋集团的政策辩护，企图把这种政策说成是为了“自卫”，但是，目前正在建立中的西德联邦国防军实际上是排他性的西方军事集团的武装部队的组成部分，这一军事集团目的在于反对苏联和同苏联友好的爱好和平的国家。
    照会表示：苏联过去、现在和将来都一贯地反对西德军国主义的复活，不论它采取的是什么形式。照会谴责西德政府正当各大国在寻求达成普遍裁军和许多国家已经采取了裁军的实际行动的时候，宣布要建立一支五十万人的军队，拒绝讨论关于限制两个德国的武装部队的任何建议，并且坚持实行普遍义务兵役制，替发展到几百万人的军队创造了前提。
    照会说：由于在德国领土上已经成立了两个不同的国家，由于其中之一——德意志联邦共和国已经参加了北大西洋公约并且开始执行军国主义化和镇压西德居民民主权利的政策，因此，关于通过全德普选的办法统一德国的这种说法就不再有现实的基础。目前德国没有条件举行这种选举。
    照会在谈到西德政府所提到的关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题时说：目前存在着的两个德国参加保证全欧安全的集体措施，这不仅将能够大大便利于实际解决欧洲安全问题，而且还能消除恢复德国民族统一的道路上的许多障碍。
    苏联政府认为，西德政府提出的关于在欧洲建立东西方之间的非武装地带的建议，在某种情况下，可能是值得注意的。可惜这个建议的提出仅仅是为了再一次掩护规定全德加入侵略性的北大西洋集团的计划。至于西德政府所谓只有在德国统一问题解决的同时裁军问题才能获得解决的这种说法，实际上是造成更多的困难而使得两个问题都不能解决。对于西德政府声明它准备承担义务，不对非北大西洋集团和非西欧联盟成员国的欧洲国家使用武力这一点，照会要求西德政府解释清楚，上述声明是否意味着德意志联邦共和国政府打算同有关国家就这个问题签订相应的协定。
    照会最后指出，目前苏联和西德之间的关系是不能令人满意的。虽然苏联和西德两国政府代表团在莫斯科就发展双方贸易问题确定地达成了协议，但至今两国还没有就这个问题进行谈判。从西德遣返流落在那里的苏联公民的问题也没有得到令人满意的解决。
    照会说：苏联政府认为，西德和苏联政府最好就两国之间的关系问题作进一步的交换意见。同时，苏联政府仍旧认为，发展苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的正常关系也将有助于解决恢复德国统一的问题。
