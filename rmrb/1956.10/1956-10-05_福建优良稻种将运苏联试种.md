    (Our newspaper's dispatch) Fujian province will ship two excellent late-rice varieties to the Soviet Union for trial planting. These two excellent varieties are "Yizhi Zao" from Putian County and "Aijiao Qinggu Zhong" from Haicheng County.

    "Yizhi Zao" is a double-cropping late-rice variety with excellent characteristics such as drought resistance, fertilizer tolerance, flood resistance, and non-shattering. Its yield per mu is around 500 jin, which is 15%-20% higher than ordinary varieties.
