Xinhua News Agency, Shigatse, 9th. The agricultural exhibition held in Shigatse City since National Day has been welcomed by local farmers and aroused great interest in them. The exhibition showcased 42 types and a total of 291 varieties of crops and vegetables successfully grown by the Shigatse Agricultural Experiment Station. During the three days of the exhibition, more than 11,000 people visited, and many farmers from Bailangzong and Dingxika, dozens of miles away from Shigatse, also came to visit the exhibition.

The Wugong No. 17 wheat, which achieved a bumper harvest this year on a large area, the maize that was successfully trial-planted here for the first time this year, and the Baron and other varieties of potatoes introduced from the Northeast this year, aroused great interest among the visitors. These crops or varieties that did not exist here in the past have now achieved high yields. The average yield of Wugong No. 17 wheat is 700 jin per mu, and the highest is 920 jin per mu. The average yield of potatoes can reach more than 15,000 jin per mu. According to agricultural staff, the Shigatse area will become an ideal area for potato cultivation in the future due to suitable temperature and climate.

The rape, sunflowers, tobacco leaves, flax, millet and other crops introduced from the Northwest, Northeast, and East China exhibited at the exhibition all grew tall and lush. Among the more than 30 kinds of vegetables, there were radishes weighing 25 jin, cabbages weighing 27 jin, pumpkins weighing 30 jin, and the largest tomatoes weighing 12 liang each.

Twenty-three farmers held a forum after the visit. They asked the farm to give them seeds and tell them scientific cultivation methods, and some farmers' children asked to join the farm work. According to the requirements of the farmers, the Shigatse Agricultural Experiment Station is preparing to first promote the open-field cultivation methods of potatoes, rape, spring wheat, cabbages, radishes and some melons in the coming year.

    日喀则举行农业展览会
    展出试种成功的玉蜀黍等多种作物
    新华社日喀则9日电　从国庆节开始在日喀则市举行的农业展览会，受到当地农民欢迎并引起他们很大的兴趣。展览会展出了日喀则农业试验场种植成功的四十二个种类、共二百九十一个品种的作物和蔬菜。展出的三天中，有一万一千多人参观，距日喀则几十里的白朗宗、丁溪卡等地的许多农民，也来参观了展览会。
    今年大面积栽培获得丰收的武功十七号小麦，今年第一次在这里试种成功的玉蜀黍以及今年从东北引进的男爵等品种的马铃薯，引起了参观者极大的兴趣。这些过去在这里没有的作物或品种，现在都获得了高额产量，武功十七号小麦平均每亩产量有七百市斤，最高的达九百二十市斤，马铃薯的平均产量每亩可达一万五千斤以上。据农业工作人员说，日喀则地区由于温度和气候适宜，今后将成为栽培马铃薯的理想地区。
    展览会上展出的从西北、东北、华东等地引进的油菜、向日葵、烟叶、亚麻、小米等作物，枝叶都长得高大茂盛。在三十多种蔬菜中，有二十五市斤重的萝卜，二十七市斤重的莲花白，三十市斤重的南瓜，最大的蕃茄一个也有十二两。
    有二十三个农民在参观后举行了座谈，他们要求农场送给他们种子和告诉他们科学的栽培方法，还有些农民子弟要求参加农场工作。日喀则农业试验场根据农民们的要求，准备在明年首先推广马铃薯、油菜、春小麦、莲花白、萝卜和部分瓜类作物的露地栽培方法。
