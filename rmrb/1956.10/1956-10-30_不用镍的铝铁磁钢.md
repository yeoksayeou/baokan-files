    Nickel-Free Aluminum-Iron Magnet Steel

    Dai Wenzhou and other technicians from the Shanghai Joint State-Private Jiangnan Electrical Equipment Factory have recently successfully trial-produced a type of aluminum-iron magnet steel that uses absolutely no nickel.

    Magnet steel is a material with a wide range of uses in the telecommunications and electrical appliance industries. It is needed in the "heads" of loudspeakers, the earpieces of telephone receivers, and many types of instruments. The manufacture of high-quality magnet steel requires a considerable amount of nickel. Nickel is a rare and precious metal in China, and yet many important industrial products cannot do without it. Due to the shortage of nickel, the Jiangnan Electrical Equipment Factory's magnet steel production had been seriously affected.

    The Jiangnan Electrical Equipment Factory's trial production of aluminum-iron magnet steel was successful after more than a hundred explorations and experiments, having mastered the technology of adding carbon to this type of magnet steel and the quenching technology of the magnet steel. According to tests by the Central Broadcasting Administration, the reed loudspeakers assembled with this magnet steel, apart from being slightly larger in size, are no less inferior in sound quality than aluminum-nickel-iron magnet steel. Using this magnet steel to manufacture reed loudspeaker "heads" could save nearly ten tons of nickel in Shanghai alone each year.

    不用镍的铝铁磁钢
    上海公私合营江南电工器材厂技术人员戴文周等，最近试制成功一种完全不用镍的铝铁磁钢。
    磁钢是电讯、电器工业方面用途相当广的器材。扩音喇叭的头子里，电话耳机的听筒里，以及许多种的仪表里，都需要用磁钢。制造优质磁钢要用相当多的镍。镍在我国是一种稀有的贵金属，而许多重要的工业产品又不得不用镍。因为缺少镍，江南电工器材厂的磁钢生产曾受到相当严重的影响。
    江南电工器材厂试制铝铁磁钢，是经过一百多次摸索试验，掌握了在这种磁钢里加炭和磁钢的淬火技术以后获得成功的。用这种磁钢装配的簧舌喇叭，经中央广播事业管理局测定，除掉体积略大以外，其音质不次于铝镍铁磁钢。用这种磁钢来制造簧舌喇叭头子，在上海一地一年就可以节约近十吨镍。
