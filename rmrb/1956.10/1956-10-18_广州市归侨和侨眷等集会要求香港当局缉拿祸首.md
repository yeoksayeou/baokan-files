Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th - Returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and Hong Kong and Macao students studying in Guangzhou have been gathering for days, severely condemning the British authorities in Hong Kong for failing to take resolute measures to arrest the Kuomintang special agent ringleaders who created the riots in Kowloon, and demanding that the British authorities in Hong Kong take responsibility for handling the aftermath for the suffering compatriots.

Yesterday, more than two thousand returned overseas Chinese students and students who had lived in Hong Kong and Macao held separate gatherings. Xuan Ming, who is studying at the Guangzhou Hong Kong and Macao Students Tutoring School, said at the meeting that Kuomintang special agents destroyed my home in Kowloon, and my sister-in-law worked at the Wai Luen Textile Factory in Tsuen Wan and is still missing. Returned overseas Chinese students and Hong Kong and Macao students who attended the meeting with him all believed that the real culprits who created this riot must not be allowed to escape.

    广州市归侨和侨眷等集会要求香港当局缉拿祸首
    据新华社广州16日电　广州市的归国华侨、华侨眷属和回到广州就学的港澳学生，连日来纷纷集会，严厉斥责香港英国当局至今仍未采取坚决措施缉拿在九龙制造骚乱的国民党特务罪魁，并要求香港英国当局负责办理受难同胞善后工作。
    昨天，两千多位归国华侨学生和曾住在港澳的学生分别举行集会。正在广州港澳学生补习学校学习的禤鸣在集会上说，国民党特务分子在九龙捣毁了我的家，我的嫂在荃湾伟纶纱厂做工，至今还下落不明。和他在一起集会的归侨学生、港澳学生都认为决不能让制造这次暴乱的真正罪魁漏网。
