We Like Reading Rural Surveys

Recently, the People's Daily published several rural surveys that we found very interesting. These articles reflect some of the more important issues in the agricultural collectivization movement and agricultural production from different regions, different times, and different perspectives. They contain both vivid factual data and summaries of the lessons learned from work experience. These typical materials are of great help to leading organs and scientific research departments. (Xue Fan, Chinese People's University)

I read Comrade Ke Lin's "Living Under a New Economic System" on the third page of the September 6th issue again and again, reluctant to put it down. I feel that this article not only gives great encouragement to rural work cadres but also serves as a spur. We are happy that these farmers, who have suffered oppression and poverty for generations, are beginning to live a happy life through cooperation. The author also raised some new issues in agricultural cooperatives, such as the fact that wealthy middle peasants feel unfree and unhappy joining the cooperatives and "make trouble" in the cooperatives; and that poor peasants like Wang Lao Jie are experiencing financial difficulties because the advanced cooperative abolished land remuneration. This article made us think, while seeing the achievements, whether the agricultural cooperatives we lead or in our hometowns have these new problems that still need to be solved.

Subheading Inserted in the Wrong Paragraph

In Comrade Zhu De's speech at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, published in your newspaper on September 19, the subheading "Fully Utilize the Favorable Conditions of Vast Territory, Abundant Resources, and Large Population" added by the editor was inserted in the wrong paragraph. This title should have been inserted above the next paragraph, "Another important favorable condition for our country to build socialism is its vast territory, abundant resources, and large population...", instead of being inserted in the paragraph about strengthening the great unity of the people of the whole country.

It is a good thing for editors to add subheadings, but due to carelessness, the subheading was inserted in the wrong place, resulting in a mismatch between the title and the text, which is very inappropriate.
(Gu Yunwu, Central School of Political Science and Law Cadres)

This is Only a Corner of Zunyi City

The photograph of "Historical City - Zunyi" was published on the fourth page of the September 11th issue. The title of "Panoramic View of Zunyi City" is inappropriate. The photograph only shows the back of Xinhua Road in the new city and the houses along the river in the old city. Not to mention anything else, the main street from Nanmenguan in the new city to Beida Road Station, which is about four kilometers long, was not photographed at all. It would be more appropriate to call that photograph "A Corner of Zunyi City."

Regarding the Era of Ramses III

In the "Egyptian Journey" on the sixth page of your newspaper on September 10, it was mentioned that the magnificent Temple of Amun was "built by the ancient Egyptian White King Emperor Ramses III around twelve years before the Christian era." This statement is worth discussing. According to the era of the ancient Egyptian Emperor Ramses III, it was around 1230 BC. The original text says around twelve years before the Christian era, which must be a mistake. "White King Emperor" seems to be a mistake for the two characters "Emperor."
(Guo Zhiping, Tianjin Yaohua Glass Company)

Editor's Note: "White King Emperor" is indeed a mistake for "Emperor." As for the reign of Ramses III, there are several different versions, but it is generally believed to be in the twelfth century BC, not twelve years before the Christian era.

    我们喜欢读农村调查
    最近人民日报刊登了几篇农村调查，我们读了很感兴趣。这些文章从不同地区、不同时间和不同角度，反映了农业合作化运动和农业生产中的一些比较重要的问题，既有生动的事实资料，又总结了工作中的经验教训。这些典型材料，对领导机关和科学研究部门都有很大帮助。　（中国人民大学雪凡）
    9月6日三版克林同志写的“生活在新的经济制度下”，我读了一遍又一遍，不肯离手，觉得这篇文章，既给予了农村工作干部很大鼓舞，也给予了鞭策。我们为这些世代受压迫、生活贫困的农民开始过合作化的幸福的生活而高兴。作者还向我们提出了农业社里的一些新问题，像富裕中农觉得入社不自由、不痛快，在社里“闹情绪”；又像王老皆这样的贫农，因为高级社取消土地报酬而生活困难。这篇文章让我们在看到成绩的时候，也联想到了自己所领导的或自己家乡的农业社，是否有这些新的问题还待解决。

    小标题插错了段落
    9月19日你报登出的朱德同志在中共第八次全国代表大会上的发言中，编者所加的“充分利用地大物博人多的有利条件”这个小标题插错了段落。这个标题应该插在下一段“我国建成社会主义的另一个重要的有利的条件，就是地大物博和人口众多。……”的上面，而不应该插在谈加强全国人民大团结的那一段上面。
    编者加小标题原是好事，但由于疏忽大意，插错了标题，造成题文不符，这是很不应该的。

    这只是遵义市的一角
    9月11日第四版登载了“历史名城——遵义”的照片。其中“遵义市全景”一幅的标题不恰当，照片上仅仅出现了新城新华路的背面和老城沿河一带的房舍。不说别的，单是新城南门关到北大路车站，约四公里的一条主要大街就一点没有拍摄。那幅照片叫做“遵义市一角”倒还可以。
        （遵义市税务局一群读者）
    关于拉美西三世的年代
    9月10日你报第六版“埃及纪游”中说到规模宏大的阿蒙神的寺庙是“纪元前十二年左右古埃及白王帝拉美西三世建立的”，这个提法是值得商榷的。按埃及古皇帝拉美西三世的年代，是纪元前1230年左右，原文说纪元前十二年左右，想必有误。“白王帝”似为“皇帝”两字之误。
    （天津耀华玻璃公司郭治平）
    编者按：“白王帝”确是“皇帝”之误。至于拉美西三  世的在位时期，有几种不同的说法，但一般都认为是在纪元前十二世纪，而不是纪元前十二年。
