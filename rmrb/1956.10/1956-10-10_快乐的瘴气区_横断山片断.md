　　Happy Malaria Zone
　　-- Fragments of the Hengduan Mountains
　　Our Reporter Chen Yongjin
    This is the legendary Nujiang River... the "Malaria Zone"?
    Nujiang? The mountains and valleys are filled with the sound of cicadas. Beautiful red junglefowl and pearl chickens stare blankly at passing cars and caravans on the roadside, as if welcoming those who are developing the Nujiang. The gray-green Nujiang River flows calmly between the valleys. In the banana groves, bunches of bananas hang heavily from the large leaves. The large bamboo forests make this land even more beautiful. However, it doesn't seem to be these things that make the Nujiang beautiful, but the milky white and light gray tiled houses, the large fields of flowering, cotton-shedding cotton on the black soil by the Nujiang River, corn taller than northern sorghum, large pineapple fields, and the already fruitful coffee... But even more exciting are the young men in red shorts, carrying sprayers, killing insects in the cotton fields, and the girls in floral and blue shirts, carrying baskets to pick cotton.
    Not long after I arrived at the cotton research station, I went to the cotton field near the house to look at the cotton. Mao Congxin, a stout young man with a red face, rolled up his trouser legs and walked over happily, saying:
    "Take a look at the cotton from Nujiang!" He looked at me and then turned his gaze to the large cotton field, saying: "Nujiang is precious because of this place. Look at our cotton. In Nujiang, you can sow and harvest at any time of the year. Any crop planted here can have a good harvest. We can not only grow double-season rice here, but also double-season cotton and three-season corn." Mao Congxin said, and then chuckled. His smile was so innocent and simple.
    At this moment, the singing of two girls picking cotton came from not far away. They sang:
    If there is no rain in the sky,
    The begonias on the ground will not bloom by themselves,
    As long as brother can wait patiently,
    The girl in your heart will come running.
    Hearing such a tune in the Nujiang Valley of the Hengduan Mountains is particularly interesting. Mao Congxin reminded me:
    "Listen! The girls here can really sing! Now there are more than ninety in the cotton research farm alone, and there are also many in the youth farms and state-owned farms over there! As long as there is a house, there are people getting married. There are several couples waiting for a house to get married! You know, in the past, Nujiang was rumored to be a place where you would marry off your wife if you went there! Now it's completely turned upside down."
    The sun was still shining high on the cotton fields of Nujiang, and the bell rang for the end of work under the locust tree in front of the tiled house over there. Just after the bell rang, a comrade shouted:
    "Comrades! There's a movie today, hurry up and eat dinner and go see the movie!"
    "Comrade Mao Congxin, can you see movies in the Nujiang Valley?" I asked.
    "Not only can you see movies, but you can also see operas! There will be a flower lantern opera tomorrow!"
    Those young men and women came back from the cotton fields, rice fields, coffee fields, pineapple fields... to eat dinner.
    The cotton research station is such a good place! It's on the hillside of an unnamed hill. There are so many mountains that no one knows the name of this small hill. All they know is that behind this small hill is the Gaoligong Mountain soaring into the clouds; on the other side of the Nujiang River is the Nu Mountain. In the courtyard of the cotton research station, which consists of several rows of tiled houses, there are several papaya trees planted, full of papayas, some of which have turned golden yellow. If you pay attention to the white jasmine flowers when you drink tea in Beijing, you will be surprised to see a large row of jasmine flowers in front of the cotton research station. Jasmine flowers, like weeds, are left unattended in many places in the Nujiang River.
    After dinner, because it was still early before the movie, people went to the river to take a bath. Mao Congxin stayed behind to hold the baby and talk to me. Mao Congxin's wife, Yang Jinhuan, also sat down with us to talk. An old lady in a dark blue dress, nearly sixty years old, was washing pots in the bamboo fence house, and several other old ladies were also holding babies in the yard to enjoy the cool air. Mao Congxin started with these old ladies:
    "The most difficult hurdle to come to Nujiang is these old ladies, including my mother."
    The cotton research station moved to Nujiang from Mangshi at the end of 1952. When passing through Baoshan, Mao Congxin went home to see his mother. When his mother found out that they were moving to Nujiang to produce, she anxiously advised Mao Congxin:
    "Settle down and farm at home. You can't go to Nujiang when you're young. If you go to Nujiang, I won't live anymore. Haven't you heard that Nujiang has malaria? Didn't you know that Mao Jinyao died of malaria after spending a night in Nujiang on a business trip? Who dares to go to Nujiang!"
    "Just go if the superiors tell you to! I'll take care of the family." Mao Congxin's older brother said.
    Director Zhang of the cotton research station also mobilized Mao Congxin:
    "Nujiang is most suitable for growing cotton. You can grow two crops a year there, which is more beneficial to our experimental work. Many people say that Nujiang has malaria, which is superstition. People are just afraid of getting malaria. People say that if you go to Nujiang, you should marry off your wife, but we will hang up mosquito nets first when we go to Nujiang. If you hang up mosquito nets, you won't be afraid of mosquitoes, and what's there to be afraid of if you take preventive medicine? We must create miracles in Nujiang."
    "These are all feudal sayings, and there's really nothing to it!" Mao Congxin勉强勉强 said to the director. But in reality, he was still a little afraid. Mao Congxin also ran to his fiancée's place before coming to Nujiang.
    Mao Congxin's fiancée was the township's women's director and a member of the Communist Youth League. She wanted to be at the forefront of everything the Party called for. Mao Congxin asked her:
    "I'm going to Nujiang, do you have any opinions?"
    "No opinion!" Yang Jinhuan said unexpectedly: "Go to Nujiang and work hard. I'll go to Nujiang to find you later."
    The day after the workers from the research station went to Nujiang, Mao Congxin himself came to Nujiang carrying a small luggage roll. He arrived before dark after traveling more than a hundred miles. With a fearful heart, Mao Congxin descended the tall Nu Mountain alone. What appeared before him was a cloud of mist. The clouds fell from the Gaoligong Mountain. Mao Congxin suspiciously asked himself: Is this "malaria"? Am I really going to die here? His lover's encouragement to him, the stationmaster's encouragement to him, made him determined to come down and find his companions. On the side of the small road, he found not the residence of the comrades working at their cotton research station, but the ruins of an unknown number of generations. This immediately reminded him of what his grandmother and mother said when he went home this time. Those malignant disease names that are difficult to find even in medical books threatened Mao Congxin. Although it was December, the weather was still so hot and humid. He took off his cotton-padded jacket and continued to look for their construction site. After searching for a long time, he found the only village on this large barren land—Dushu Village. What a terrible village! Mao Congxin thought: It was probably a large village in the past, and people died, leaving only one family. Mao Congxin trembled and didn't find his group of people until it was dark.
    At night, the mosquitoes in Nujiang flew around people like they were beating gongs. Mao Congxin hung up the mosquito net first and lay lazily in the small mosquito net. As soon as it got dark, wolves, deer, and muntjacs started calling nearby. That thin young man, Bao Jixian, encouraged everyone with the exemplary spirit of a Communist Party member: Look how fertile this land is. Cotton must grow well. As long as we do a good job, we will definitely complete the task given to us by the leadership. But Mao Congxin didn't want to listen to these things.
    When the people of Libiega on the tall Nu Mountain saw them building houses, they kindly advised them to live on the mountain, saying that it was winter now, and when the weather got hot, it would be terrible here. The Dai people living far away on the plains also came to advise them, saying that the Dai people lived here because it was "sealed by the emperor," and you will get malaria here. Several leaders of the research station resolutely replied to them: We will live here permanently.
    Mao Congxin said that when they first came to Nujiang, they were afraid of people dying. Every night, four people rotated to keep watch, specifically checking whether the workers' mosquito nets were hung properly and whether the quilts were covered properly. Because they paid attention to hygiene and took care of their bodies, their bodies became healthier than before, and their faces became redder than before. These people who came to reclaim wasteland, when they had nothing to do, would settle accounts with the people of Libiega on Nu Mountain, so that they would know that climbing more than forty miles a day to the mountain to produce was not as good as buying a mosquito net to go down the mountain, and taking preventive medicine would prevent malaria. However, the people in the mountains still looked at them with envious and fearful eyes, watching the black soil they had opened up, and listening to the songs and musical instruments of this group of young people. At night, they looked at the lights of the newcomers in this plain area from the high mountains.
    In March, the weather started to get hot, and the workers endured the pain of the devil's needles piercing their skin, opened up some wasteland, and planted long-staple cotton. When the weather got hot, the fear of "malaria" recurred in people's minds. Mao Congxin got malaria, and his thoughts became unstable again. He had a bad temper, and quarreled with the stationmaster over a trivial matter. At this time, his newlywed wife, Yang Jinhuan, came. As soon as Yang Jinhuan came to the Nujiang Cotton Research Station, she fell in love with the happy collective life. She said to Mao Congxin:
    "Our life is much better than before. How good is this Nujiang! Let's live here for the rest of our lives!"
    Mao Congxin only gave a cold, silent answer to Yang Jinhuan's enthusiastic encouragement.
    After the first harvest, the establishment of the Youth League began in the research station, and Mao Congxin's request to join the League was not approved. Yang Jinhuan also felt ashamed of this. She advised Mao Congxin:
    "Your temper is too impatient. You shouldn't quarrel with others. You should obey the leadership."
    "I have many shortcomings. I will overcome these shortcomings and strive to join the League again."
    From then on, it was already clear that Mao Congxin was striving to join the League. When the cotton fields needed watering, he and Youth League member Xin Zhu often watered from dark to dawn, and Yang Jinhuan specially made egg noodles for Mao Congxin at night. In order to unite the Dai brothers, Mao Congxin helped them water in his spare time. In order to prevent sabotage by bad people, the young couple also carried guns to guard the yard on those torrential rainy nights. In their happy labor, the millet harvest in July 1954 was 600 jin per mu. At this time, Mao Congxin was approved to join the League; at this time, Yang Jinhuan gave birth to her first son. Now Mao Congxin is already a Communist Party member, and he is also the production team leader of the cotton research station. They say that it won't be long before the tractors come. It won't be long before the light of electric lights will shine here. They will guarantee to bring greater harvests to the country, create better long-staple cotton, and catch up with Xinjiang's thousand-jin cotton.
    The harvest of the Nujiang Cotton Research Station, the beautiful piano and huqin sounds of the young people, attracted the people on Gaoligong Mountain and Nu Mountain who were afraid of "malaria" and dared not go down. Now around the cotton research station, in the Daojie Senior Cooperative, the State-owned Farm, the Benglong Ethnic Cooperative... all this symbolizes the prosperity of the Nujiang. There are fewer mosquitoes, and the legendary "malaria" has become a historical term.

　　快乐的瘴气区
　　——横断山片断
　　本报记者　陈勇进
    这就是人们传说里的怒江?“瘴气区”。
    怒江?满山满谷尽为蝉的叫声充塞着。美丽的红山鸡、珍珠鸡，在路边的灌木丛里昂着头呆呆地凝视着过路的汽车和马帮，它们像是在迎接开发怒江?的人们。灰清色的怒江，从夹谷间平静地流过去。那芭蕉林子里，一串串的芭蕉从那肥大的叶子间沉重的垂下来。那大片大片的竹林，使这块土地显得更加美丽。不过，使怒江?美丽的似乎并不是这些，而是那些乳白色和清灰色的瓦房，而是那大片大片的在怒江边的黑土上开花的、吐絮的棉花，比北方高粮还高的玉米，那大片的菠萝田，那已结实的咖啡……不过令人更兴奋的是那些穿着红短裤的小伙子，扛着喷雾器，在棉田里打虫子，那些穿着花布衫、蓝布衫的姑娘们拿着箩箩采棉花。
    我来到棉作试验站不久，就到屋边的棉花田里看棉花。毛从新，一个粗壮的脸儿红红的小伙子，挽着裤腿脚乐呵呵地走来说：
    “看看这怒江?的棉花吧！”他看了看我又把目光投向那大片的棉花田里说：“怒江?宝气就宝气在这个地方，你看我们的棉花吧，怒江?一年四季什么时候都可播种，什么时候都可收获，啥庄稼种到这里都可丰收。我们这里不但可以种双季稻还可以种双季棉花，三季包谷。”毛从新说着又嘿嘿的笑了。他笑得是那样天真而纯朴。
    这时，从不远的地方传来两个采棉花的姑娘的歌声，她们唱着：
    如果天上没有雨水，
    地上的海棠花不会自己开，
    只要哥哥能耐心的等待着，
    你心上的姑娘会跑步来。
    在横断山的怒江?子里听到这样的曲子，特别使人感到有趣。毛从新提醒我：
    “你听！我们这里的姑娘可会唱歌哩！现在光棉作试验农场就有九十多个，那边的青年农庄、国营农场……的姑娘也不少呀！只要有房子就有结婚的。等着房子结婚的就有好几对哩！你知道怒江?这个地方，过去还传说着：要下怒江?就把老婆嫁哩！现在完全翻过来了。”
    太阳还高高的照着怒江的棉花田，那边瓦屋前槐树下敲起了下班的钟声。在这钟声刚刚响过之后，有一位同志喊着：
    “同志们！今天有电影，要快着吃饭看电影去呀！”
    “毛从新同志，这怒江?子里也能看到电影吗？”我问。
    “不光能看到电影，还可以看到戏哩！明天就有花灯戏！”
    那些青年小伙子们，姑娘们从棉田里、稻田里、咖啡田里、菠萝田里……回来吃晚饭了。
    棉作试验站是多么好的地方呀！它在一个无名的小山丘的半坡，山实在太多了，谁也不知道这个小山的名字，只知道这个小山包后面耸入云端的是高黎贡山；怒江那面的是怒山。棉作试验站为几排瓦房组成的院落里，栽着几棵木瓜树，木瓜累累，有的已成了金黄色。如果你在北京喝茶的时候，注意那小白茉莉花的话，你在棉作试验站的房前，会奇怪的看到一大排茉莉花。茉莉花在怒江?的不少地方，确像野草一样没人管它。
    吃过晚饭，因为离看电影的时候还早，人们都到江边洗澡去了。毛从新留下来抱着娃娃和我谈话。毛从新的爱人杨金焕也和我们一块坐下来谈。一个穿深蓝色的近六十岁的老太太在竹篱房子里刷锅，大院子里还有几个老太太也抱着娃娃在院子里乘凉。毛从新就从这些老太太们的身上开始了：
    “到怒江?来，最困难的一关，就是这些老太太们，我母亲也包括在内。”
    棉作试验站是1952年底从芒市搬到怒江?来的，路过保山的时候，毛从新回家看了看，他母亲知道他们要搬到怒江?来生产，就着急地劝毛从新说：
    “在家盘田算啦，年轻轻的可不能到怒江?去，你要去怒江?，我就不活了。你没听说怒江有瘴气吗？你不知道毛金耀做生意路过怒江?，在那里住了一夜就得哑瘴死了。谁敢到怒江?去呀！”
    “上级叫去你就去吧！家里有我照顾着。”毛从新的哥哥说。
    棉作试验站的张站长也动员毛从新：
    “怒江?最适合种棉花，在那里一年可以种两季，对我们的试验工作更有好处。很多人说怒江?有瘴气，那是迷信，人们无非是怕得疟疾病，人家说要下怒江?就把老婆嫁，我们是要下怒江?先把蚊帐挂。挂上蚊帐就不怕蚊子咬，再吃上预防药还有什么可怕呢。我们一定要在怒江?创造奇迹。”
    “这都是封建时候的说法，实际上也没有什么！”毛从新勉强地对站长说。但实际上他仍然有些怕。毛从新临来怒江?的时候还特地跑到他的未婚妻那里。
    毛从新的未婚妻是乡的妇女主任，又是青年团员，她对党号召的一切都要走在前头。毛从新问她：
    “我要到怒江?去，你有什么意见没有？”
    “没有意见！”杨金焕出人意料地说：“到怒江?好好地工作，以后我要到怒江?去找你。”
    毛从新在试验站工人去怒江?的第二天，自己也背着小行李卷来怒江?了。百多里路不到天黑就来到了。毛从新带着恐惧的心情，独个儿下了高大的怒山，出现在他眼前的是一片云雾，云块从高黎贡山上落下来。毛从新疑神疑鬼地问自己：这是“瘴气”吗？难道真的要死在这里吗？他爱人对他的鼓励，站长对他的鼓励，使他下定决心走下来找寻他的伙伴。在小路边他找到的不是他们棉作试验站工作同志的住地，而是不知多少年代的废墟。这马上使他想起这次回家时他祖母说的，母亲说的，那些连医学书上都难以找到的恶性病名威胁着毛从新。虽然是12月，天气还是那么闷热，他脱下了棉袄继续找寻他们的工地。找了好久，才找到这大片荒芜土地上仅有一家人家的寨子——独树寨。多么可怕的村庄呀！毛从新思索着：大概过去是个大寨子，人死得剩了一家。毛从新战栗地找到天黑才找到他们那伙伙人。
    入夜，怒江?的蚊虫像敲锣样的在人的周围飞动着。毛从新先把蚊帐挂起来，懒散地躺在小蚊帐里。天刚黑，狼、马鹿、麂子就在近处叫起来了。那个干瘦的小青年包继先，他以共产党员应有的模范精神鼓励大家：你们看这地多肥，长棉花一定很好。咱们只要好好地搞，一定能完成领导上给的任务。可是毛从新却不愿听这些。
    当高大的怒山上的里不戛的人们，看到他们盖房子的时候，就好意地劝他们到山上住，说现在是冬天，天气一热，在这里可不得了。住在远处平?上的傣族群众也跑来劝他们，说傣族在这里住是“皇帝封下来的”，你们在这里要着瘴气。试验站的几个领导人毅然回答他们：我们要永久地在这里住下来。
    毛从新说他们刚来到怒江?的时候，就怕死人，每天夜里总有四个人轮流守夜，专门检查工人的蚊帐挂没挂好，被子盖没盖好。正因为他们讲究卫生，注意身体，他们的身体比过去更健康了，脸儿比过去红了。这些来开荒的人，没事的时候就和怒山上里不戛的人们算细账，使他们知道每天爬四十多里路上山生产，不如买个蚊帐下山来，再吃预防药就不得疟疾病了。可是大山上的人们还是以羡慕、恐惧的眼光看着他们，看着他们开出来的黑土，听着这群青年人的歌声和琴声。夜里从高山上看看这平?区新人的灯火。
      3月里天气热起来了，工人们忍受着鬼箭草扎破皮的痛苦，开出了一些荒地，并且播种了长绒棉花。天气热了，人们怕“瘴气”的病根又复发了。毛从新得了疟疾，他思想上又不稳起来。他的脾气不好，因为一点小事就和站长吵起来。正在这时候，他结婚不久的爱人杨金焕来了。杨金焕一来怒江棉作试验站，就爱上了那快乐的集体生活，她对毛从新说：
    “我们的生活比过去好多了，这怒江?有多好呀！我们在这里住一辈子吧！”
    毛从新对杨金焕的热情的鼓励只是冷冷的无言的回答。
    在第一次丰收后，试验站里开始建团了，毛从新入团的要求没被通过，杨金焕也为此感到羞惭。她劝毛从新：
    “你的性子太急，不应当和别人吵，要服从领导。”
    “我的缺点很多，我克服了这些缺点再争取入团。”
    从此以后，已经看出毛从新争取入团的劲头了。在棉花田需要浇水的时候，他和青年团员辛竹往往从天黑浇到天明，杨金焕夜里还特为毛从新做来鸡蛋面。毛从新为团结傣族弟兄，在工作之余帮他们浇水。为了防备坏人的破坏，在那大雨滂沱的夜里，小两口还背着枪在院子里警卫。在他们愉快的劳动里，1954年的7月谷子得到了每亩六百斤的丰收，就在这个时候毛从新被批准入团了；就在这时候，杨金焕生了第一个儿子。现在毛从新已经是共产党员了，他也是棉作试验站的生产队长。他们说等不了多久拖拉机就来了。等不了多少天电灯的光亮就会照射到这里来。他们将保证给国家带来更大的丰收，创造更好的长绒棉，赶上新疆的千斤棉花。
    怒江棉作试验站的丰收，青年人的幽美的琴声、胡胡声，把高黎贡山、怒山上怕“瘴气”而不敢下?的人们吸引下来了。现在在棉作试验站的周围，在道街?高级社、国营农场，崩龙族合作社……这一切都象征着怒江的繁荣，蚊子少了，传说里的“瘴气”已成了历史上的名词了。
