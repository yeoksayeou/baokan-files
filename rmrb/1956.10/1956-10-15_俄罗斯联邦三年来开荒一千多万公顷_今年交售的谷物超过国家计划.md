Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch: According to TASS news: As of October 10th, collective farms and state farms in the Russian Federation, the largest republic of the Soviet Union, have already delivered and sold 2,004,000,000 poods (each pood equals 32.76 market catties) of grain to the state, exceeding the original national plan by 319,000,000 poods, which is 580,000,000 poods more than the total amount of marketable grain supplied to the state by the republic in 1955.

The Russian Federation's significant achievement in developing grain production is mainly the result of large-scale reclamation of wasteland over the past three years. From 1954 to the present, the republic has reclaimed a total of 14,900,000 hectares of wasteland. This year, marketable grain produced for the state by various regions, territories, and autonomous republics in the reclaimed areas accounts for more than half of the total in the Russian Federation. As of October 10th, collective farms and state farms in these areas have delivered and sold 1,223,000,000 poods of grain to the state, while in 1953, they supplied a total of only 497,000,000 poods of grain to the state.

    俄罗斯联邦三年来开荒一千多万公顷
    今年交售的谷物超过国家计划
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社消息：到10月10日为止，苏联最大的加盟共和国俄罗斯联邦的集体农庄和国营农场已经交售和出售给国家二十亿零四百万普特（每普特合三十二点七六市斤）谷物，超过国家原计划三亿一千九百万普特，比共和国1955年供应给国家的商品粮的总量还多五亿八千万普特。
    俄罗斯联邦在发展谷物生产方面的这一重大成就，主要是三年来大规模开垦荒地的结果。从1954年到现在，共和国总共开垦了一千四百九十万公顷荒地。今年，开垦地区各州、边疆区和自治共和国为国家生产的商品谷物就占全俄罗斯联邦的一半以上。到10月10日为止，这些地区的集体农庄和国营农场已经向国家交售和出售了十二亿二千三百万普特谷物，而在1953年，他们供应给国家的谷物总共只有四亿九千七百万普特。
