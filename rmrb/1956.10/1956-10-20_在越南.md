    In Vietnam
    They Enjoy the Warmth of the Motherland
    In the northern part of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, there are nineteen middle and primary schools specifically established for students from South Vietnam. Currently, these schools have nearly 12,000 students, an increase of 1,500 compared to last year. In addition, thousands of South Vietnamese students are studying in other schools in North Vietnam.
    These South Vietnamese students receive the cordial care and attention of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In each school or group of schools, students have their own hospitals, reading rooms, and clubs. During this year's summer vacation, thousands of South Vietnamese students spent pleasant holidays at seaside sanatoriums or visited factories and scenic spots in the capital, Hanoi.
    In addition, more than 2,500 South Vietnamese students have been sent by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to fraternal countries to study.
    A Group of Overseas Chinese from France Return Home
    With the consent of the French government, twelve overseas Vietnamese from France boarded a French ship on September 10 and returned to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. These overseas Vietnamese were workers who went to France seventeen years ago to work. Prior to this, another four overseas Vietnamese returned from France on September 2. These overseas Chinese were warmly welcomed by the Vietnamese government and people upon their arrival at Haiphong Port.
    Inviting South Vietnamese Students to Sanatoriums in Beijing
    The Central Committee of the Vietnam Students' Union recently wrote to South Vietnamese students, inviting ten South Vietnamese students suffering from lung diseases to recuperate at the Asian Students' Sanatorium in Beijing. All expenses for these South Vietnamese students during their convalescence will be borne by the Vietnam Students' Union and the International Student Union. They will stay in rooms prepared for Vietnamese students in the Asian Students' Sanatorium. (Photo attached)

    在越南
    他们享受了祖国的温暖
    在越南民主共和国北部，有十九所中、小学校是专为南越学生设立的。目前，这些学校的学生达到近一万二千名。比去年增加一千五百名。除此之外，还有数千名南越学生在北越的其他学校学习。
    这些南越学生受到越南民主共和国政府的亲切关怀和照顾。在每个学校或几个学校内，学生们都有自己的医院、阅览室和俱乐部。在今年暑假期间，数千名南越学生曾经到海滨疗养所度过愉快的假期或者参观首都河内一些工厂和名胜古迹。
    另外，二千五百多名南越学生已被越南民主共和国政府送到兄弟国家留学。
    一批旅法侨民回国
    在得到法国政府的同意后，十二名旅法的越南侨民于九月十日搭乘一艘法国轮船回到越南民主共和国。这批越南侨民都是十七年以前到法国去做工的工人。在此之前，还有四名越南侨民于九月二日从法国回来。这些侨民到达海防港时，受到越南政府和人民的热烈欢迎。
    邀请南越学生到北京疗养
    越南学生联合会中央委员会最近写信给南越学生，邀请十名患肺病的南越学生到北京的亚洲学生疗养院疗养。这些南越学生在疗养期间的一切费用全部将由越南学生联合会和国际学联负担。他们将住在亚洲学生疗养院为越南学生预备的房间内。（附图片）
