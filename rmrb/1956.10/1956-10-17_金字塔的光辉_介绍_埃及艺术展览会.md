    The Glory of the Pyramids
    ——Introducing the "Egyptian Art Exhibition"
    Zhu Dan
    On the first pages of the world's cultural history, the great pyramids radiate a brilliant glow. They are miracles created by the labor of the ancient Egyptian people, forever shining in human history, becoming symbols of civilization and wisdom.
    The "Egyptian Art Exhibition" currently being held in Beijing reflects the life and struggle of the people of the beautiful "Land of the Pyramids," making us excited to see the ancient Egyptian nation regaining its youth in the anti-colonialist struggle.
    As early as around 3500 BC, the Egyptians had writing. Those beautiful hieroglyphs themselves are excellent artistic creations, which have deeply influenced today's Egyptian calligraphy, painting, sculpture, and arts and crafts. Many of the plaques and screens with quotations from the "Quran" and decorative patterns exhibited this time, with a solemn and magnificent artistic style with religious colors, add rich national characteristics to this exhibition.
    In terms of oil paintings, the exhibits in this exhibition can be roughly divided into two different styles: one type tends to be classical in style. They are generally simple in theme, elegant in form, realistic and skilled in technique, and have a strong expression and appeal. The late famous painter Shaburi's "In the Studio," the painter El-Gilgavi's "Mrs. Atteyat," "Music," and the painters Latif-Nassim's "Female Head," and Lachinte's "Portrait," which are similar to their style, all belong to this category of works. These works show a high degree of oil painting effect, and the colors, shapes, and compositions all show the beauty of artistic harmony and completeness. Another style tends to be modern. These works are rich in Eastern characteristics in technique, with strong colors, simplified lines, compositions influenced by traditional forms, exaggerated shapes, and rich content of real life intertwined, plus other things absorbed from other nations; we can see the bold creative spirit of Egyptian artists. For example, Fanus's two paintings, "The Millstone" and "They Finally Have Food to Eat," have a concentrated theme and simple techniques. The colors used are almost only primary colors. On the screen composed of a few strokes, the artistic appeal is very strong, giving people a strong impression of tropical life. Another oil painting with special content and composition is El-Shakini's "War and Peace." The painter uses decorative flavor to adapt to his symbolic techniques. He personifies the dove of peace, but restores the wicked to animals. In terms of expression methods, obvious traces of ancient Egyptian paintings appear.
    In addition, there are many moving watercolor paintings, gouache paintings, prints, and decorative paintings. Abdel Fatah's screen "Women of Southern Egypt" has the unique charm of classical art. Rizk's watercolor painting "Summer Resort" and Katab's watercolor painting "Aswan Market", although different in the thickness of the brushstrokes, have consistent graceful sentiments and clear styles.
    The nearly sixty gum watercolor sketches by the Wangli brothers are particularly eye-catching works in this exhibition. They use lively and skilled brushstrokes to capture the momentary postures of music and dance of various ethnic groups, which can be called vivid and thorough. Another thing that should be mentioned is Sherif's cloth paintings "Night of the Karnak Temple" and "Blessing." This kind of national artwork with a strong decorative taste and traditional symmetrical composition has many similarities with Chinese paintings, which makes us feel exceptionally cordial.
    Sculpture is an important part of this exhibition and a major aspect of Egyptian art. Here we see the outstanding works of the classical master Mokhtar, "Monument Pattern," "Head of the Bride on the Nile" and "Farm Foreman," which enable us to understand the most outstanding part of modern Egyptian sculpture. Mokhtar's attainments are obviously due to ancient Egyptian figure portraits and tomb stone carvings. The figures are solemn and full of life, appearing infinitely tall, showing the completeness and permanence of art, which is a clever combination of ancient artistic tradition and modern advanced realistic techniques. In the same style as him, Mansur's "Goose Seller" and the "Motherhood" and "Peasant Woman" produced by the Academy of Applied Arts, all make people feel real, vivid and cordial.
    Egyptian wood carvings also have a long tradition. Its characteristics are grand momentum, strong expressiveness, and emphasis on inner portrayal. Shagini's "Sorrow" and "Bride" have smooth lines and profound expressions; his "Village Chief" further portrays a sense of solemnity and majesty. Fami's "Music" and "Asia and Africa" are both very meaningful themes. The latter uses an eagle to symbolize the spirit of the Asian-African Conference, and two female images to symbolize the people of Asia and Africa, united under the spirit of the Asian-African Conference, which is full of profound meaning.
    Another creation of sculptor Shagini is the brass "hammered gold" relief, which is a wonderful set of artworks. Their themes are extremely combative, and their expressions are full of romanticism. In the picture, people are portrayed as great giants. They create the achievements of industry, agriculture, culture and art. They work, fight, open the dark iron gate, and attack the snake that symbolizes colonialism and evil forces. Olive leaves become sharp arrows, and the dove of peace pecks out the snake's eyes, finally achieving victory and obtaining the light symbolized by the sun. This is a set of art with the momentum and strength to symbolize Egypt's own destiny and will, thus winning the audience's love, praise and sympathy.
    Egyptian applied art and handicrafts are also very rich and full of characteristics. Here are folk wooden lattice windows composed of geometric patterns derived from hieroglyphs, old-fashioned chairs inlaid with ivory stripes, tapestries and carpets with patterns such as palm trees, Islamic churches, birds of paradise, lions, and camels, as well as magnificent screens such as "Gold Foil Peacock," which show the rich life knowledge and outstanding creativity of the Egyptian people.
    The exhibits of the "Egyptian Art Exhibition" represent all aspects of Egyptian art and are exceptionally rich; although these artworks are mainly modern works, from them we can see the tradition and influence of Egyptian culture over the past five thousand years. From the perspective of Egypt's history and cultural traditions, it is ancient; but from the heroic spirit shown by the Egyptian people today and the creativity of Egyptian artists, it is forever young!

    金字塔的光辉
    ——介绍“埃及艺术展览会”
    朱丹
    在世界文化史最前面的篇页上，伟大的金字塔放射着灿烂的光辉，它是古代埃及人民劳动创造的奇迹，永远在人类历史上照耀着，成为文明和智慧的象征。
    正在北京举行的“埃及艺术展览会”，反映了美丽的“金字塔的国度”的人民的生活和战斗，使我们兴奋地看到古老的埃及民族在反殖民主义的斗争中又恢复了她的青春。
    远在公元前三千五百年左右，埃及人就有了文字，那些美丽的象形文字本身就是很好的艺术创造，它使埃及今天的书法、绘画、雕刻和工艺美术都受到很深的影响。这次展出的许多写着“可兰经”格言的纸匾、挂屏以及装饰图案，带有宗教色彩的庄严、富丽的艺术风格，给这个展览会增添了丰富的民族特色。
    在油画方面，这个展览会的展品，大体上可以分为两类不同的风格：一类是在作风上倾向于古典的，它们大致是主题单纯、形式典雅、技法写实而熟练，有强烈的表现力和感染力。已故名画家沙布里的“画室里”，画家艾尔—吉尔加维的“阿特雅特夫人”、“音乐”，以及同他们的风格相近的画家拉梯夫—乃西姆的“女子头像”，拉清特的“肖像”，都是属于这一类的作品。在这些作品上表现了高度的油画效果，在色彩、造型和构图上，都显出艺术的和谐和完整的美。另一类风格是倾向于现代的，这类作品在技法上富于东方的特色，强烈的色感、简化的线、受着传统形式影响的构图、经过夸张的造型和丰富的现实生活的内容交织在一起，再加上从其他民族吸收来的别的东西；可以看出埃及艺术家大胆的创造精神。如法努斯的“碾子”和“他们终于有饭吃了”等两幅画，主题集中，技法单纯，所用色彩几乎只是一些原色，在寥寥几笔构成的画面上，艺术的感染力却非常强烈，使人对于热带生活产生浓厚的印象。另一幅具有特殊的内容和构图的油画是艾尔—沙基尼的“战争与和平”，画家发挥装饰风味来适应他的象征手法，他把和平鸽人格化了，但却把恶人还原为动物，在表现方法上明显地出现了埃及古典绘画的遗迹。
    除此之外，还有很多动人的水彩画、水粉画、版画和装饰画。阿布戴尔法塔的挂屏“埃及南方的妇女”有着古典艺术的特有的魅力。利兹克的水彩画“避暑地”和卡塔卜的水彩画“阿斯旺的市集”，虽然在用笔上粗细不同，但幽美的情调和明朗的风格则是一致的。
    旺利兄弟的为数近六十张的树胶水彩速写是这个展览会中特别引人注目的作品。他们以生动熟练的笔锋尽情攫取各民族的音乐舞蹈的刹那的姿态，可以称得上淋漓致尽。另外应该提起的是舍里夫的布画“卡尔纳克庙之夜”和“祝福”，这种有着浓厚的装饰趣味和传统的对称构图的民族艺术品，和中国的绘画有很多相近之处，使我们感到异常的亲切。
    雕塑是这个展览会的重要组成部分，也是埃及艺术的一个主要的方面。在这里我们看到古典大师莫克塔尔的优秀作品“纪念碑图案”、“尼罗河上的新娘头像”和“农场监工”，使我们领会到埃及现代雕刻中最杰出的部分，莫克塔尔的造诣很明显地得力于埃及古代人物肖像和陵墓石刻，人物庄严而富于生命，显得无限高大，表现出艺术的完整性和永久性，这是古代艺术传统和现代先进的写实技法的巧妙结合。和他同一风格的，有曼苏尔的“卖鹅妇”，实用美术学院出品的“母性”、“农妇”，都使人感到真实、生动而又亲切。
    埃及的木雕也有着悠久的传统，它的特点是气魄宏大和表现力强，注重内心刻划。沙吉尼的“哀伤”、“新娘”，线条流利，表情深刻；他的“村长”，更刻划出庄严和雄伟的感觉。法米的“音乐”、“亚洲和非洲”，主题都是极有意义的，后者用鹰来象征亚非会议的精神，并用两个女子像象征亚非两洲的人民，在亚非会议的精神号召下团结起来，是富有深意的。
    雕刻家沙吉尼的另一种创造是黄铜的“锤金”浮雕，这是一组精彩的艺术品，它们的主题有极大的战斗性，表现方法上富于浪漫主义的色彩。在画面上，人们被表现为伟大的巨人，他们创造着工业、农业、文化艺术的成果，他们劳动着、战斗着，打开黑暗的铁闸，向着象征殖民主义和恶势力的蛇进攻，橄榄树叶变成了利箭，和平鸽啄瞎了蛇的眼睛，终于获得胜利，获得用太阳象征着的光明。这是一套有气魄、有力量的象征埃及自身的命运和意志的艺术，因而赢得了观众的喜爱、赞许和同情。
    埃及的实用美术和工艺品也是非常丰富和富于特色的。在这里有来源于象形文字的几何图案构成的民间木格窗棂，镶嵌象牙条纹的老式椅，缀有棕榈树、伊斯兰教堂、极乐鸟、狮、驼等。图案的壁毯和地毯，以及金碧辉煌的挂屏如“金箔孔雀”等等，表现出埃及人民丰富的生活知识和卓越的创造性。
    “埃及艺术展览会”的展览品，代表着埃及艺术的各个方面，是异常富丰的；这些艺术品虽然主要的是现代的作品，但是从它们可以看到五千年来的埃及文化的传统和影响。从埃及的历史和文化的传统来看，她是古老的；但从埃及人民今天所表现的英雄气概和埃及艺术家的创造力来看，她又是永远年轻的！
