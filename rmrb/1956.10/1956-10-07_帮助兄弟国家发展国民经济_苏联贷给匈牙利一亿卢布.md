    Helping Brotherly Countries Develop Their National Economy
    The Soviet Union Lends Hungary 100 Million Rubles
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th. According to TASS: The Soviet government, in accordance with an agreement reached with the government of the Hungarian People's Republic, will provide Hungary with a loan of 100 million rubles in 1957. The annual interest rate on the loan is two percent, and the principal and interest will be repaid by Hungary with goods between 1960 and 1965.
    On October 5, Hungarian Foreign Ministry spokesman Rubin said at a press conference held in Budapest that the Soviet Union's loan of 100 million rubles to Hungary is a great help to the development of Hungary's national economy. The Soviet Union did not attach any political demands when concluding this loan agreement, which is beneficial to us. As everyone knows, obtaining loans from capitalist countries requires lengthy negotiations, and they also attach harsh conditions.
    At the press conference, Rubin also spoke about the relationship between Hungary and the United States. He said that recently, there have been some changes in the relationship between the United States and Hungary. However, the United States is currently creating various obstacles in terms of contact and cultural exchange between the two countries. In the future, the Hungarian government will continue to do everything possible to resolve some of the issues that exist between the two countries, and hopes that the U.S. government will also take action in this regard.

    帮助兄弟国家发展国民经济
    苏联贷给匈牙利一亿卢布
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联政府根据同匈牙利人民共和国政府达成的一项协议，将在1957年为匈牙利提供一亿卢布的贷款。贷款的年利息是二厘，本息将由匈牙利在1960—1965年间用货物偿清。
    10月5日，匈牙利外交部发言人鲁宾在布达佩斯举行的记者招待会上说，苏联给予匈牙利一亿卢布贷款，这对匈牙利国民经济发展是一个很大的帮助。苏联在缔结这项对我们有利的贷款协定时并不附带任何政治要求。大家知道，要向资本主义国家取得贷款，就得经过长期的谈判而且它们还附带有苛刻的条件。
    在记者招待会上，鲁宾还谈到了匈牙利和美国的关系问题。他说，最近，美国和匈牙利的关系有了某些改变。但是，目前美国在两国联系和文化交流方面还在制造种种障碍。今后，匈牙利政府仍将尽一切可能来解决两国之间存在的一些问题，并且希望美国政府在这方面也有所作为。
