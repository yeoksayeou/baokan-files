　　Promoting New Developments in Traditional Chinese Painting

　　Nine out of ten paintings from the Tang, Five Dynasties, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties are realistic depictions of mountains, waters, people, and objects. For example, Bian Luan's paintings of birds in the Tang dynasty, Hong Guzi's landscapes in the Five Dynasties, Li Cheng's barren trees and Emperor Huizong of Song's flower-and-bird paintings in the Song dynasty, Huang Dachi's landscapes in the Yuan dynasty, and Jiu Long Shanren's (Wang Fu's) and Shen Shitian's (Zhou Chen's) landscapes in the Ming dynasty were all based on sketching from life. Other records, such as "Emperor Taizong of Tang once enjoyed boating in the spring garden pool with his attendants, and upon seeing an exotic bird swimming on the water, he was pleased and summoned Yan Liben to paint its likeness," and "In the early years of Tianbao in the Tang dynasty, Chen Hong was known for his paintings of horses. He was ordered to study under Han Gan, but the emperor found that his paintings of horses were different from Chen Hong's, and asked him the reason. Gan replied: The horses in Your Majesty's inner stable are all my teachers," can be found everywhere in the history of painting. All of this proves that ancient Chinese paintings were indeed based on sketching from life. Furthermore, Zhang Zeduan of the Song Dynasty painted "Along the River During the Qingming Festival," depicting the busiest area of Bian River at that time. Every part of the wooden arch bridge in the painting is shown in detail and conforms to the principles of perspective, making the depiction very realistic. This could not have been done without sketching from life. Twenty years ago, I saw the "fenben" (ancient sketches and drawing books) left by ancient art masters in Da Feng Tang in Shanghai, including landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, and animals. This shows that the ancients also drew sketches and did studies, relying on them to prepare for their creations. These are all things that we Chinese painters should learn from, and facts that Chinese painting critics should pay attention to.
　　The ancients said about painting: "It is better to learn from the ancients than from contemporary people, and it is better to learn from nature than from the ancients..." Learning from nature means depicting the beauty of nature and everything in reality, rather than copying ancient paintings. Therefore, the ancient painting heritage does contain Chinese painting techniques that can be adopted and reflect reality, which are worth studying with great attention. It is also said: "Discard the shortcomings when learning," and "Digest the old to create the new." This coincides with our goal today—critically accepting the legacy. That is, to select techniques from the rich ancient painting heritage that can reflect reality and use them to seek development, to promote new developments, to improve artistic skills, and to create new techniques with national characteristics.
　　However, not all classical painting techniques are completely acceptable. For example, I think the paintings of Mi Fu and his son are conceptual and divorced from reality. In order to thoroughly understand the advantages and authenticity of Mi-dot landscapes, I went to Jade Emperor Mountain in Hangzhou, Huangshan Mountain in Huizhou, and Nanshan Mountain in Yantai several times during the rain, and recently climbed Yuhuangding in Yantai several times during the rain, wanting to see the beauty of Mi-dot rain mountains. But the result was very disappointing. Except for some slight resemblance on Jade Emperor Mountain in Hangzhou, I couldn't find any rain scenes like Mi-dots in other places. This made me negate the old concept and method of using Mi-dots to express rain mountains, because it cannot reflect the beauty of nature. Rain mountains are indeed very beautiful and clean. When the mountain mist rises slowly, the clouds float leisurely among the high mountains. Sometimes the clouds lock the mountainside, sometimes the forest is interrupted, sometimes the near mountains disappear, and sometimes the distant mountains suddenly appear. The mountains, rocks, trees, and grass greatly increase the dark green color, making people feel refreshed. It is indeed possible to paint extremely beautiful pictures, but Mi-dots are not enough to express one-hundredth of its beauty, but instead reduce its beautiful, quiet posture and infinitely changing scenery. If we cling to Mi-dots as the only brushstroke for painting rain mountains, it will only become an obstacle for us to adapt to new content and create better techniques.
　　Some people are very strict about the limitations of using "cun" (wrinkling) techniques, such as not being able to intersperse "fu pi cun" (axe-cut strokes, the wrinkling method of the Northern School) in "ma pi cun" (hemp-fiber strokes, the wrinkling method of the Southern School). I think this limitation is inappropriate. Other "cun" techniques can be used in one picture, as long as it helps to express the true image and seeks a harmonious effect.
　　As for copying ancient paintings, it is indeed a means to improve skills, but if one only copies ancient paintings without creating, then the original meaning of copying ancient paintings is lost. So my opinion is: "For the sake of creation, one can copy ancient paintings." At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Dong Qichang vigorously promoted copying ancient paintings, which created a later trend. Therefore, most painters in the Qing Dynasty mainly copied ancient paintings, circling around in the works of the ancients. They often wrote inscriptions such as "In the style of Huang Dachi" on a painting of unknown meaning, which became a joke. We should be wary of this self-deceiving behavior, the prejudice of taking copying ancient paintings as a skill, and the bad habit of not creating.
　　The several characteristics reflected by the national style in the form of traditional Chinese painting art are: (1) There must be composition with distance, priority, contraction, expansion, emptiness, fullness, sparseness and density; (2) There must be brushstrokes with turning, straightness, thickness, thinness, firmness and softness; (3) There must be ink techniques with richness, lightness, dryness, moistness, seeking simplicity rather than magnificence, that is, subtle coloring, and using rubbing and rendering to express light and shadow. After mastering these characteristics, a vivid "qi yun" (vitality and rhythm) will be produced. We can experience and learn these characteristics from ancient paintings.
　　To reflect reality by analytically and critically absorbing the excellent traditional techniques of classical painting, we must further practice on and seek out the realistic techniques and national style characteristics, that is, the essence, of the Chinese painting heritage. On this basis, we can promote new developments to create new techniques with a rich national style, making it more suitable for reflecting real life, so that we can create Chinese paintings that meet the needs of the masses and not fall behind the times. It has long been affirmed that Chinese painting needs to draw themes and images from real life, so that the works can increase the breath of life and realistic and moving power, and this is the direction we are working towards. But the lines of figures in the paintings of Wu Daozi and Zhou Fang, and the landscape brushstrokes of Huang Dachi, Dong Yuan, and Juran are also objects for us to draw essence from; the flower-and-bird painting methods of Bian Luan and Qian Xuan are also sufficient for our reference. All techniques that can reflect reality can be used as powerful aids to our creation.

　　国画的推陈出新
  　陆元鼎
    唐、五代、宋、元、明的绘画，十之九都是写真山、真水、真人、真物的。如唐边鸾的翎毛，五代洪谷子的山水，宋李成的枯树和宋徽宗的花鸟，元黄大痴的山水，都是写生的，明九龙山人（王绂）和沈石田（周）的山水，也曾写生。其他如“唐太宗尝与侍臣泛舟春苑池，见异鸟游泳波上，悦之，因召阎立本其状画”、“唐天宝初，陈闳以画马称，诏令韩干师事之，而怪其所画之马与陈闳不同，因问其故，干答曰：陛下内厩之马，皆臣之师也”等等记载，在画史里俯拾即是。都可以证明我国古代绘画确是写生的。又宋代的张择端，将当时汴水最热闹的地方，画成“清明上河图”，这画上木拱桥的每一部分构造，都详细地在画面上表现了出来，而又符合透视的原理，描绘得非常真实，不写生是办不到的。二十年前，我曾在上海大风堂看到古代艺术大师们遗留下来的粉本（古人的速写和素描本），其中有山水、人物、花鸟、走兽等，可见古人也画速写和素描，也同样依靠它来做创作的准备工作，这些都是我们国画家应该取法的，同时也是国画批评者们应予注意的事实。
    古人论画：“师今人不如师古人，师古人不如师造化……”。所谓师造化，即是写自然界的美和现实中的一切，而不是临摹古画，所以古人的绘画遗产里，确有可以采用的、能反映现实的国画技法，值得我们以很大的注意加以研究。又说：“师法舍短”、“食古而化”，这同我们今日的目标——批判地接受遗产相暗合，就是要在丰富的古代绘画遗产里，选择能反映现实的技法来运用，求发展，求推陈出新，以提高艺术技巧，并创造新的民族风格的技法。
    但是，古典绘画，技法并非完全可取的，例如米芾父子的画我认为是概念的，脱离实际的。我为了要彻底了解米点的优点和真实性起见，曾先后几次趁雨登杭州玉皇山、徽州黄山和烟台南山，最近又数次雨中登烟台毓璜顶，欲观米点雨山的美，可是结果大失所望，除在杭州玉皇山见到些微相像外，旁的地方竟找不到一些像米点的雨景，这使我否定了以米点来表现雨山的老观念、老方法，因为它不能反映自然界的美。雨山的确很美丽洁净，在山岚袅袅上升的时候，云悠悠然在高山间荡漾着，忽而云锁山腰，忽而丛林中断，忽而近山失踪，忽而远山突现，山、石、树、草大大地增加了黛绿色，使人心目为之一清，确可画出极美丽的图画，而米点不足以表现其百一，反而减少了它幽美清净之姿和变化无穷之景，如果死抱住米点为画雨山的唯一笔法的话，适足成为我们适应新内容而创造更好技法的障碍。
    有人对使用皴法的限制很严，如麻皮皴（南宗的皴法）中不能间用斧劈皴（北宗的皴法）等，我认为这限制不当，一图中可以参用其他皴法，只要有助于表现真实形象，并需求得和谐的效果。
    至于摹古，固不失为提高技巧的一种手段，但是如果专事摹古而不创作，就失去了临摹古画的原意，所以我的意见是：“为了创作，可以摹古。”明末董其昌大力提倡摹古，造成了后来的风气，因此清朝一代的大部分画家，以临摹古画为主，专在古人作品里兜圈子，往往在一幅不知所云的画上，题上“抚黄大痴笔法”等款识，闹成笑话。这种自欺欺人的行为和以摹古为能事的偏见，不事创作的恶习惯，我们应当切戒。
    民族风格在国画艺术的形式上所反映的几个特点是：（1）要有远近、主从、收放、虚实和疏密的章法；（2）要有转折、曲直、粗细、刚柔的笔法；（3）要有浓淡、枯润、求朴质而不求华丽的墨法，也就是含蓄的着色，而以擦与渲染来表示阴阳向背。掌握了这几项特点后，就会产生生动的气韵了。这特点，我们可以从古绘画里体会到、学习到。
    有分析、有批判地汲取古典绘画的优良传统技法来反映现实，我们必须在国画遗产上再实践、寻找其中的现实主义技法和民族风格的特色，也就是国画的精华。在这基础上推陈出新，以创造新的富有民族风格的技法，使它更可适合于反映现实生活，才能创作符合群众需要的国画，而不致落于时代的后面。国画需要从现实生活里汲取题材和形象，使作品增加生活气息和真实动人的力量，这是早经肯定了的，也是我们努力的方向。但吴道子、周昉等的人物画的线条，黄大痴、董源、巨然的山水笔法，也是我们汲取精华的对象；边鸾、钱舜举等的花鸟画法，也足为我们参考。凡是能反映现实的技法，都可以作为我们创作的有力帮助。
