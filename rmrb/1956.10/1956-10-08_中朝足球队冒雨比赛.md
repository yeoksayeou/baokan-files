Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The Chinese football team, composed of football players from the Beijing Institute of Physical Education, competed in the rain today with the football team of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The North Korean team won with a score of one to zero.

The fast-running North Korean team got a corner kick opportunity in the eighth minute of the second half. Right winger Kim Jong-seon kicked the ball, and it curved straight towards the goal. Chinese goalkeeper Zeng Xuelin jumped to save the ball too early, and the ball fell into the goal, causing China to lose a point.

After that, the North Korean team mostly adopted "destructive" defensive tactics, kicking the ball out of bounds whenever the Chinese team attacked. Although the Chinese team had several good shooting opportunities, the forwards were too slow, allowing the North Korean defenders to intercept the ball in time. Therefore, the Chinese team was unable to score.

    中朝足球队冒雨比赛
    据新华社7日讯　由北京体育学院足球运动员组成的中国足球队今天冒雨同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国足球队举行比赛，朝鲜队以一比零获胜。
    奔跑迅速的朝鲜队在下半场比赛进行到第八分钟时获得发“角球”的机会，右边锋金正善踢出的球走着弧线直奔球门，中国队守门员曾雪麟跳起扑球过早，球掉入门内，中国队失去一分。
    以后，朝鲜队大部分时间都采取了“破坏性”的防守战术，中国队一进攻，他们就把球踢向界外。中国队虽然获得多次良好的射门机会，但是由于前锋动作太慢，使朝鲜队后卫来得及赶到把球截去。因此中国队始终没能得分。
