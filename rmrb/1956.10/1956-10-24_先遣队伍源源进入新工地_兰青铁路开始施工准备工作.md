Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 22nd -- Advance teams for the construction of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway have entered the new construction site from Lanzhou to Xining to carry out preparations before construction. Along the banks of the Yellow River and Datong River in the Fushan area, white tents where railway construction workers live have recently appeared. The workers are building material warehouses, engineering machinery repair shops, and sheds covering thousands of square meters. The transportation lines connecting the Gan (Su) Qing (Hai) Highway to the construction sites of the No. 3 and No. 4 Datong River bridges have been completed. Horse-drawn carts and trucks are transporting building materials and daily necessities to the site.

    The Lanzhou-Xining railway construction project is large in scale, involving the construction of hundreds of bridges, culverts, and tunnels. At present, a construction force has been assembled in the Lanzhou area. As soon as the construction houses are completed, they can successively enter the new construction site. Cotton clothes, cotton shoes, cotton gloves, and heating stoves for the winter use of the railway construction workers are all fully prepared.

    People of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province have also organized hundreds of horse-drawn carts to help workers transport road construction materials. Farmers of all ethnic groups in Minhe County are weaving large numbers of carrying baskets and willow mats for the railway workers. People along the line have also vacated hundreds of houses to accommodate the large groups of railway construction workers who will soon be entering the new construction site.
