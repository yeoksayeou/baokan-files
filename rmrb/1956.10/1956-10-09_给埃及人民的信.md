A Letter to the People of Egypt

I am an ordinary female citizen of the People's Republic of China, and like my countrymen, I am deeply concerned about the struggle of the Egyptian people to recover the Suez Canal Company. This great struggle of the Egyptian people greatly inspires all the oppressed working people of the world.

I am the mother of a child. My son was born on the morning of July 26, 1956, the very day Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company. To commemorate this great day for the Egyptian people, I named my child "Suez." My "Suez" is very chubby and beautiful. He sleeps happily in my arms every day, just like the Suez Canal, which has been managed and protected by its true owner, the Egyptian people.

I am concerned about the struggle of the Egyptian people for national independence and sovereignty. Their struggle is just, and the Suez Canal should be returned to the Egyptian people. However, the governments of Britain, France, and the United States, in order to maintain their colonial power, have ignored the stern warnings of all peace-loving people around the world and continue to vainly attempt to seize the Suez Canal. They have deployed troops and sharpened their swords, fully exposing their aggressive faces. The imperialists, failing in one plan, have hatched another, and they have planned a so-called "Association of Users" in London, which is clearly intended to provoke Egypt and the peace and security of the world.

The Chinese people are preparing to fully support the Egyptian people at every moment. Our Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai have expressed the will of our 600 million Chinese people. We will always stand with you—the great Egyptian people—against colonialism.

### 给埃及人民的信

    给埃及人民的信
    我是中华人民共和国的一个普通女公民，我和我的祖国人民一样，十分关怀埃及人民收回苏伊士运河公司所进行的斗争。埃及人民的这一伟大的斗争大大地鼓舞了全世界一切被压迫的劳动人民。
    我是一个孩子的母亲。我的儿子是在1956年7月26日上午出生的，这正是埃及宣布把苏伊士运河公司收归国有的日子。我为了纪念埃及人民的这个伟大的日子，便给孩子命名为“苏伊士”。我的“苏伊士”长得很胖，很漂亮。他每天幸福地睡在我的怀里，就像现在的苏伊士运河似的已经受到了她真正的主人——埃及人民的管理和保护一样。
    我关心埃及人民为争取民族独立和主权所进行的斗争。他们的斗争是正义的，苏伊士运河理应归还埃及人民。然而，英、法、美三国政府为了维持他们的殖民势力，却不顾全世界一切爱好和平的人们的严正警告，继续妄想劫夺苏伊士运河。它们调兵遣将，磨刀擦枪，完全暴露了它们的侵略面貌。帝国主义一计未成连生二计，它们又在伦敦策划了一个所谓“使用国协会”，这显然是想对埃及和全世界的和平和安全进行挑衅。
    中国人民每时每刻都在准备全力支持埃及人民。我们的毛泽东主席和周恩来总理已经说出了我们六亿中国人民的意愿。我们要永远和你们——伟大的埃及人民站在一起，反对殖民主义。
