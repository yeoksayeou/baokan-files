	Question: We strive to increase the income of every member. Are former rich peasant members included in this?
	Zhu Jianfang

	Answer: Former rich peasant elements who have had their class status changed and have been absorbed into agricultural cooperatives as members or probationary members have the same obligation to participate in collective labor and the same economic rights as ordinary members. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives should rationally arrange their labor so that they can also increase their income. Some rich peasant elements had exploitative income before joining the cooperative. After they give up exploitation and join the cooperative, when comparing their income after joining the cooperative with their income before joining the cooperative, the portion of exploitative income before joining the cooperative should be deducted before making the comparison. This calculation should also apply to other members who had some exploitative income before joining the cooperative.

    是否也要使原为富农成分的社员增加收入
    问：力求每个社员增加收入，原为富农成分的社员是否包括在内？
    朱建芳
    答：已经改变成分被吸收参加农业合作社成为社员或候补社员的过去的富农分子，他们在社里和一般社员有共同劳动的义务，也有同样的经济权利。因此，农业合作社应该合理安排他们的劳动，使他们也能增加收入。有些富农分子，入社前有剥削收入，他们放弃剥削入社以后，在对比入社后的收入和入社前收入的时候，应该扣除入社前剥削收入部分，然后对比。其它社员入社前有部分剥削收入的，也都应当这样计算。
