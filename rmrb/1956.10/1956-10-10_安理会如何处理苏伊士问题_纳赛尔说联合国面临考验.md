Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 8th: Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser stated in a speech on October 7th that the Security Council's discussion of the Suez issue is a decisive test for the United Nations.

In a conversation with Moheiddin, the editor-in-chief of the Cairo "Evening News," Nasser said that all small countries are now looking to the United Nations to see if their rights will be trampled on to satisfy French and British imperialism.

Nasser pointed out that the canal internationalization insisted upon by Western countries is "merely another name for collective colonial rule." He said that world opinion has exposed the hypocritical face of Britain and France on the Suez Canal issue. World opinion knows that Egypt has not violated any international treaties; Egypt has only nationalized a joint-stock company and canceled its lease rights.

Nasser also accused the imperialists of attempting to sow discord within Arab countries in order to continue implementing their "divide and rule" policy, which they have always used to enslave Arab nations. He said, "The resurgence of the Arab nation is an accomplished fact, and the conspiracies of imperialism and its lackeys are doomed to failure."

In the conversation, Nasser also announced that the federation of Egypt and Syria could be realized soon. He said: Recent developments have proved the necessity of such a federation.

    安理会如何处理苏伊士问题
　　纳赛尔说联合国面临考验
    新华社8日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔10月7日发表谈话指出：安全理事会对苏伊士问题的讨论是对联合国的一个有决定意义的考验。
    纳赛尔在对开罗“晚报”的主编摩海丁发表的谈话中说，所有的小国现在都在望着联合国，看看它们的权利是不是会因为要满足法国和英国帝国主义而遭到蹂躏。
    纳赛尔指出，西方国家所坚持的运河国际化“只不过是集体殖民主义统治的另一个名称”。他说，世界舆论已经把英法在苏伊士运河问题上的虚伪面貌揭露出来了。世界舆论知道，埃及并没有破坏任何国际条约，埃及只是把一个股份公司收归国有而取消了租借权。
    纳赛尔还指责帝国主义者企图在阿拉伯国家内部散播不和，以便继续实行他们一向用来奴役阿拉伯国家的“分而治之”的政策。他说，“阿拉伯民族的复兴是一个既成的事实，帝国主义和它的走狗的阴谋是注定要失败的”。
    纳赛尔在谈话中还宣布，埃及和叙利亚的联邦在最近就可以实现。他说：最近的事态证明了这种联邦是必要的。
