Since the Party Central Committee issued the call to "Advance towards science," the popularization of science and technology in various provinces, cities, and counties across the country has entered a new stage. The number of members of the Science and Technology Popularization Association only grew to 38,267 from 1950 to the end of 1955, but according to incomplete statistics from January 1956 to the present, it has grown to 111,664; the number of member work groups was only 874 before last year, but has grown to 3,121 from January of this year to the present; the number of branch associations was only 110 before last year, but has now grown to 603; the number of lectures given annually was only about 10,000 before last year, but from January to July of this year alone, 44,392 lectures were given. Science and technology publications, films, slides, exhibitions, and so on have also seen corresponding development.

During this period, many advanced units and individuals in science and technology popularization work have emerged across the country. For example, Qingdao State-owned Cotton Factory No. 2 conducted 265 science and technology lectures in the first half of this year and plans to conduct 460 in the second half. After learning scientific and technological knowledge, many workers have played a significant role in increasing labor productivity. Li Shaogong, a technician at the Shenyang Agricultural Machinery Factory, often wanted to invent machines and improve technology in the past, but he couldn't draw sketches. Since he studied Professor Zhao Xuetian's "Crash Course in Reading Drawings," he has designed four sets of jig drawings and improved four sets of jigs, including the improved 24-row seeder box and left and right jigs, which increased work efficiency by 133%.

With the widespread development of science and technology popularization work among workers, the close cooperation between workers and scientists and engineers has also been strengthened.

    职工科普工作有很大发展
    本报讯　全国各省、市以及县的科学技术普及工作，在党中央提出“向科学进军”的号召以来，已进入了一个新的阶段。科学技术普及协会会员从1950年到1955年底只发展到三万八千二百六十七名，据1956年1月到现在不完全的统计，就发展到十一万一千六百六十四名；会员工作组去年以前只有八百七十四个，今年1月到现在已发展到三千一百二十一个；支会去年以前只有一百一十个，现在已发展到六百零三个；讲演次数去年以前，每年只讲一万次左右，今年1月到7月就讲了四万四千三百九十二次。科学技术的出版物、电影、幻灯、展览等等，也有相应的发展。
    在这期间，全国出现了很多科学技术普及工作的先进单位和人物。例如青岛国棉二厂今年上半年进行了二百六十五次科学技术讲演，下半年计划进行四百六十次。许多工人学习了科学技术知识以后，对提高劳动生产率起了很大作用。沈阳农业机械厂的技术工人李绍恭过去常想发明机器、改进技术，但画不出草图来。自从他学习了赵学田教授写的“速成看图法”以后，自己就一连设计了四套胎具图纸，改进了四套胎具，仅其中改进的二十四行播种盒和左右胎具，就提高了工作效率133％。
    随着职工科学技术普及工作的广泛开展，也加强了职工同科学工作者、工程技术人员的亲密合作。
