    Talking about financial management
　　Mei
    The most prominent aspect of excessive and rigid control by economic leading organs over enterprises is in the use of money. There are indeed many rigid regulations in this regard. For example, enterprise leaders only have the authority to approve expenditures below 200 yuan. Anything exceeding this amount requires going through dozens of procedures, reporting to higher authorities for approval before it can be used. Enterprise bonus funds and supplementary wages are allocated to enterprises according to the proportion stipulated by the state, but even then, there is still a lack of confidence, and it is further stipulated: a certain percentage for this, a certain percentage for that; money for salt cannot be used for vinegar, and money for vinegar cannot be used for salt.
    The people who formulated these management systems had good intentions. Wouldn't setting the system in more detail and managing it more deeply more effectively supervise enterprises to practice thrift? Wouldn't it more effectively prevent enterprises from wasting state property?
    In fact, many places have indeed achieved the expected results. For example, enterprise bonus funds, many enterprises have a lot left over; many enterprises' technical measures expenses are also not used up year after year.
    However, enterprises are full of complaints about these well-intentioned rules and regulations. Why is this?
    The reason is that these methods, while "saving money," "harm affairs."
    For example, in production, unexpected things often happen, requiring temporary additions; new weak links often appear, requiring timely measures to balance them; the masses often put forward reasonable suggestions that leaders did not anticipate, requiring timely organization and implementation. Successfully solving these problems often has a decisive significance for completing or exceeding the annual plan. However, once it exceeds 200 yuan, the enterprise is powerless. By the time the higher authorities approve it, at least two months have passed. By this time, the things to be bought are often no longer available, and the implementation of rationalization proposals and technical measures has missed the opportunity, causing what could have been increased production to fail to increase, and tasks that could have been completed to be delayed. May I ask, in such circumstances, what is the significance of the annual surplus of technical measures expenses?
    Furthermore, according to the stipulated "percentage," some enterprises only have enough money to use for employee welfare to cover the wages of the canteen cooks; other welfare undertakings urgently needed by employees cannot be carried out. In this case, what is the significance of saving the enterprise bonus fund?
    The task of financial managers is not "watching over the pile," but "managing finances." The so-called "managing finances" is to find ways to use money better and make limited money play a greater role. Thrift is always advocated. However, the purpose of thrift is precisely to use every penny in the most critical places to make it play a greater role. Irresponsible spending is, of course, wasteful, but not using money where it should be used, causing losses to production, is not considered thrift either. If managing money is only for spending less money, it would be better to simply lock the money up and not let anyone use it. Wouldn't this be simpler and more reliable than cumbersome and complex management systems?
    Now, the central government has criticized the tendency of excessive and rigid control over enterprises. Relevant departments are probably already considering how to revise or abolish these red tapes. We hope that in this reform, these departments, in addition to considering how to further promote the initiative and enthusiasm of enterprises, will also consider how to make these systems more conducive to economic development.

    谈管钱
  　?眉
    经济领导机关对企业管得过多过死，最突出的要算是用钱了。这方面的清规戒律确实很多。譬如，企业领导人只有权批准二百元以下的开支，超过此数，就要经过大小几十道手续，呈报上级批准，然后才能动用。企业奖励基金和附加工资，这是按照国家规定的比例拨付给企业的，然而还不放心，还要规定：百分之几做这，百分之几做那，买盐的钱不许买醋，买醋的钱不许买盐。
    制定这些管理制度的人，用心是很好的。把制度定得细些，管得深入些，岂不是可以更有效地监督企业厉行节约？岂不是可以更有效地防止企业里发生浪费国家资财的行为？
    事实上，也确实有不少地方收到了他们所预期的效果。譬如企业奖励基金吧，许多企业就曾剩下不少；许多企业的技术措施费，也是年年用不完。
    然而，企业里对这些用意良好的规程制度却是怨声载道，这是为什么呢？
    原因就在于：这些办法虽然“省钱”，却“害事”。
    譬如，在生产当中，常常会发生一些意外的事情，需要临时添补一些东西；常常会出现新的薄弱环节，需要及时采取措施来加以平衡，群众更常常会提出一些为领导人员预计不到的合理化建议，需要及时组织实现。顺利地解决这些问题，常常对完成或超额完成年度计划有决定的意义。然而，一超过二百元，企业就无能为力了，等到上级批下来，时间至少也过去了两个月，这时候，要买的东西，常常已经买不到了，合理化建议和技术措施的实现也错过了时机，弄得本来可以增产的没有能增产，本来可以完成的任务脱了期。请问，在这样的情况下，技术措施费年年节余，又有什么意义呢？
    再如，按照规定的“百分比”，有的企业有权用于职工福利方面的钱，只够食堂炊事员的工资，其他为职工迫切需要的福利事业都没法举办。在这种情况下，把企业奖励基金节省下来，意义又在什么地方呢？
    管钱人的任务不是“看堆”，而是“理财”。所谓“理财”，就是要想办法把钱用得更好，使有限的钱发挥更大的作用。节约，任何时候都是提倡的。然而节约的目的也正是为了把一文一毛都用在骨节眼上，使它发挥更大的作用。不该用的乱用，固然是浪费，但是，该用钱的地方不用，使生产受到损失，也不算节约。如果管钱只为了少花钱，那倒不如干脆把钱锁起来，谁也不要用，这岂不比繁锁复杂的管理制度更简便，更牢靠得多？
    现在，中央批判了对企业管得过多过死的偏向，有关部门对这些繁文琐节，想必已在考虑如何加以修正或废除了。我们希望，这些部门在这场改革当中，除了考虑如何能更加发挥企业的主动性和积极性以外，也同时考虑考虑如何把这些制度定得更加有利于经济的发展。
