Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, October 14th: The Sino-Soviet Friendship Tower, built in Lushunkou, was fully completed on the 11th.

This memorial tower, symbolizing the eternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union, is built on the square in front of the Lushun Museum. The tower is 22.2 meters high and sits on two-tiered bases, each with four spacious steps. The railings around the base are carved with white clouds, soaring doves of peace, and blooming peonies, making it magnificent. The dazzling Sino-Soviet friendship emblem on the spire, set against the backdrop of a dove of peace ready to fly, symbolizes the unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples and their determination to defend lasting world peace. Its twelve-sided tower body is entirely built of precious alabaster, a specialty of Yexian County in Shandong Province, and sturdy and beautiful granite from Qingdao, Xiongyue, and other places. The upper part of the tower is carved with twelve blooming flowers of friendship. The middle of the tower body is a relief sculpture of "Great Unity of the Chinese and Soviet Peoples," and the lower part of the tower is inlaid with four reliefs: the front depicts Tiananmen Square in Beijing and the Kremlin in Moscow; the left depicts the Anshan Iron and Steel Works blast furnace; the right depicts the Friendship Farm; and the back depicts the Victory Bridge and the Soviet Army Victory Tower in Lushunkou. These scenes symbolize the friendly unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples and the great selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to China's industrial and agricultural construction.

The groundbreaking ceremony for the Sino-Soviet Friendship Tower was held on February 23rd last year by Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense Marshal Peng Dehuai, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Soong Ching Ling, Guo Moruo, and others. The Soviet Union sent architectural experts to assist in the design. After nearly eight months of preparation, construction began on October 10th last year. During the construction process, many famous stonemasons from Jinan, Wendeng, Changchun, Shenyang, and other places, as well as teachers and students from the Northeast Academy of Fine Arts, also enthusiastically came to support the project.

    旅大市中苏友谊塔建成
    新华社旅大14日电　建立在旅顺口的中苏友谊塔已经在11日全部完工。
    这一座象征中苏两国永恒友谊的纪念塔，建立在旅顺博物馆前的广场上。塔高二十二点二公尺，座落在各有四个宽敞台阶的两层基座上。基座四周的栏杆上雕刻着朵朵白云和翱翔着的和平鸽子以及怒放的牡丹花，显得十分壮丽。塔尖上灿烂夺目的中苏友好徽，衬托着展翅欲飞的和平鸽，象征着中苏两国人民的团结和保卫世界持久和平的决心。它的十二角型的塔身，全部是用山东省掖县特产名贵的雪花石和青岛、熊岳等地坚固美观的花岗岩砌成。塔身上端雕刻着十二朵盛开的友谊花。塔身中间是一幅“中苏人民大团结群像”的浮雕，塔身下端，镶着四块浮雕：正面是北京的天安门和莫斯科的克里姆林宫；左面是鞍钢高炉；右面是友谊农场；背面是旅顺口的胜利桥和苏军胜利塔。这些画面象征着中苏两国人民友好团结和苏联对我国工农业建设的伟大无私的援助。
    中苏友谊塔是去年2月23日由国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀元帅、全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄、郭沫若等揭土奠基的。苏联曾派建筑专家来协助设计，经过近八个月的筹备，在去年10月10日开工。在施工中，济南、文登、长春、沈阳等地许多著名的细石工和东北美术专科学校的师生，也热情地赶来支援了这一工程。
