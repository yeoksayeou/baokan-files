I stayed in Chenliu County, Henan Province, for five days. During those five days, my mood was almost constantly agitated. The labor enthusiasm of the more than 20,000 rural youths here cannot help but inspire, excite, and move you to sing their praises. These young people are enthusiastic, brave, energetic, idealistic, and full of hope.

However, in the past, the county's Communist Youth League leadership failed to fully understand them, and they were not good at working according to the characteristics of young people. They exaggerated the shortcomings of the youth, saying that they lacked technology and experience, were "small and weak" and useless. As a result, the League's work seemed lifeless and stagnant. In terms of work methods, they attempted to take over all the work of the Party committee, otherwise they felt they had no energy. Every time the Party committee made any arrangements, they would repackage these instructions, adding words such as "assist" and "take the lead" before issuing them to League organizations at all levels. They believed that "the Party committee takes the main road, and the League committee takes the side road; the paths are different, but the goal is the same!" This brought a lot of trouble to the League's grassroots cadres, who felt like "a dog trying to bite a hedgehog," not knowing where to start. Many League members complained to the League cadres, saying, "Taking the lead, always taking the lead, when will we ever reach the end?" Some even wrote jingles to satirize the League's work: "The Party's body, the League's hat, the League's work is always the same old thing, instructions come down only after the event!"

Youths United Are Like an Engine Revving Up
It was after the wheat harvest last year. There had been no rain on the Chenliu Plain for a long time, and the soil was dry and hard. A hoe would raise a cloud of white dust, making it impossible to sow seeds. The farmers' reliance on heaven for food was still very serious. They said, "People are busy, but heaven is not; when heaven is busy, it's just a fleeting moment." Sooner or later, it will rain. For a time, rural work was almost paralyzed. In response to this situation, the Chenliu County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued an urgent instruction, calling on all farmers in the county to mobilize and organize emergency sowing to combat the drought. However, the farmers had no experience in emergency sowing and drought resistance, believing that "river water causes salinization, and well water is too cold," so even if they sowed seeds, it would be useless. Some said, "A snake has passed by, and the stars are winking," how much longer can we wait for rain!

Prior to this, the County Communist Youth League Committee had taken note of the establishment of youth shock brigades in other places, and the Henan Provincial Communist Youth League Committee had also proposed to the entire League that the League's working method should be: "Follow the central tasks, seize on special characteristics, commend the outstanding, and persevere to the end." Now, the Chenliu County Communist Youth League Committee, thinking of all this, decided to organize a youth shock brigade for drought resistance to break through this bottleneck.

One clear night, the drought-resistant sowing shock brigade, composed of twenty-four young men and women from Huzhai Township, set out. They carried buckets of water, basins, and hoes, and headed towards the dry land. For a time, the lyrics of the豫剧 (Yu opera) "Hua Mulan" and the song "The Five-Star Red Flag is Flying in the Wind" echoed in the sky above the fields. It broke the silence of the night and impacted people's worries. The elderly farmers who were sleeping in the fields were awakened, and they looked at this team with surprised eyes.

This group of young people sowed five and three-tenths acres of land overnight!

Five days passed. The five and three-tenths acres of land were covered in a verdant green, which told people in fact: Man can conquer nature!

Subsequently, the County Communist Youth League Committee convened a meeting of the township League committee secretaries to introduce the experience of the Huzhai Township youth shock brigade in drought-resistant sowing. It also organized visits, compiled and distributed circulars, and called on all youth in the county to carry out shock sowing to combat the drought. The Chenliu County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also added an endorsement to the League Committee's circular, instructing Party organizations at all levels to vigorously lead young people in carrying out this work. Since then, 雷声 (Leisheng), 闪光 (Shanguang), 龙虎 (Longhu), 长江 (Changjiang) … Youth shock brigades were established one after another. A large-scale shock campaign for drought-resistant sowing was launched throughout the county. According to statistics from forty-one townships, a total of 24,989 acres were sown. The corn sown yielded a maximum of more than 300 jin per mu, while the late-sown corn yielded less than 200 jin per mu.

The shock brigade completed its production tasks and also became a school for educating young people. Four young women in Wanzhai Township did not like to work in the past. This time, encouraged by the shock brigade, they went to the fields and lived with everyone for the first time. Among them, Wan Ronghua also learned to drive a cart and gloriously joined the Communist Youth League later on. In Yancheng Gang Township, there was a young woman who changed clothes three times a day and simply did not like to work. Now, she also actively participates in labor and has been rated as a township labor model and joined the Communist Youth League.

The facts educated the League cadres and inspired them, enabling them to understand in practice that young people are enthusiastic, persevering, brave, and dare to fight against old habits, and how to carry out independent activities of the League in accordance with the characteristics of young people. Their conclusion was: "Youths united are like an engine revving up!"

Since then, the League's work in Chenliu County has undergone a fundamental change. Later, the County League Committee, based on the Party Committee's central tasks in each period, gave the youth many topics and carried out a series of beneficial activities. For example, protecting seedlings and controlling pests, preventing floods and draining water, the ten-thousand-vehicle youth shock week for accumulating fertilizer, and digging wells for winter wheat irrigation, and so on. In each activity, they almost always composed jingles to express their ideals and praise their heroic actions. Here, I quote two of them:

	"Dig deep wells, sink deep wells, to ensure our wheat harvest. We plan to dig wells thirty-five feet deep, the water in the wells is good for irrigating the wheat fields. For the sake of socialist industrialization, for the sake of turning dry land into irrigated land, for the sake of a thousand jin per mu, for the sake of all-round increased production!"

	"The shock brigade is truly heroic, digging wells and irrigating wheat is called a hero. The youth compete with Zhao Yun, the elderly compete with Huang Zhong, the director of the commune is better than Zhuge Liang, the shock team members are better than Wu Song. The camp is pitched in the wheat fields, men and women, young and old, are all mobilized!"

Fighting in the Original Teams, Launching Raids on the Spot
Last winter and this spring, the high tide of agricultural cooperation swept across the entire Chenliu Plain. Soon, the peasants joined the advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives (with the exception of a very small number of landlords and rich peasants). The completion of the county's advanced agricultural cooperation marked a fundamental transformation of rural relations of production. Regular agricultural production began in the countryside and the labor organization also became more strict, and the production of each commune and team proceeded according to plan. Everything was different from the past.

However, the work of the County Communist Youth League Committee and the vast number of League cadres did not quickly catch up with this new situation. They were still intoxicated with that outdated format, attempting to still organize large-scale shock activities involving hundreds of people. As a result, the League's grassroots cadres ran into snags everywhere: the commune committees did not allow them to disrupt their production plans and casually draw people out; the young people had production quotas and were unwilling to engage in large-scale shock activities. Thus, the League's calls had no power, and even convening a meeting was extremely difficult, which frustrated the League's grassroots cadres. They said: Now the League's work must break through three barriers (the Party branch secretary, the commune director, and the team leader) before it can succeed.

In July, the county's League Congress was convened. At the meeting, the delegates discussed how to carry out the independent activities of the League after advanced cooperation. During the discussion, everyone's thoughts gradually became clear, and it was decided that the League's future work policy would be: "Fight in the original teams, launch raids on the spot."

Chenliu County has historically lacked livestock feed, and there is a folk saying that "livestock have no food every year by the middle of the third lunar month". Due to the shortage of feed, more than 1,000 head of livestock died in the county last winter and this spring. This year, the area of cultivated land for high-yield crops has increased, and due to the heavy rainfall during the wheat harvest, a lot of wheat straw and bran have rotted, making the issue of fodder even more serious. The County Communist Youth League Committee studied this situation, and according to the policy of "fighting in the original teams, launching raids on the spot," took the initiative to propose a "50 million-jin green fodder storage competition month" plan, mobilizing all the youth in the county to complete this task.

The Chenliu County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party gave strong support to this action and instructed Party organizations at all levels to allocate personnel and provide time for them. At first, the resistance of old habits still hindered the normal progress of the work, and many people did not believe that fodder could be stored green. The League cadres also had no experience in green storage, so they initially focused on experimental work in Quxing Township. This township initially only stored 50 cellars of corn stalks, but when they were dug out more than 40 days later, each cellar had a refreshing fragrance and there was no mold at all. The facts educated everyone, and the green storage movement quickly spread throughout the county. According to incomplete statistics on September 23, there were a total of 758 green storage teams and groups in the county, with a total of 1,160 cellars of green fodder storage, more than 95 million jin. According to spot checks in 14 townships, the vast majority met the standards.

At the September 28 teleconference of the township League branch secretaries, the County Communist Youth League Committee re-made arrangements, requesting that this work continue to be carried out and transition to the green storage of flower leaves, tree leaves, and green grass.

What to do?
The experience of the Chenliu County Communist Youth League Committee shows that in order to make the League's work energetic, it is first necessary to actively rely on the Party's leadership and gain the Party's trust. In the past, the Chenliu County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was also extremely unclear about how to use the organizational power of the League. County Party Secretary Liu Zhusan said, "In the past, I only heard League cadres and young people shouting to be assistants, but I was not clear in my mind about how to assist." Therefore, at that time, the Party adopted an "all-inclusive" leadership method for the League, and the relationship between the Party and the League was not close, and the League cadres harbored negative emotions. Since the League organized the youth shock brigade for drought resistance last year, the Party Committee has specifically realized the role of the League organization. Comrade Liu Zhusan said: "The relationship between the Party and the League is closer, warmer." Therefore, the Party Committee often studies the work of the League, exchanges opinions with the League cadres, and in many major activities of the League, Comrade Liu Zhusan personally gave specific instructions and used the League organization to "breakthrough the bottlenecks."

Second, organize combat forms that meet the needs of the tasks and pay attention to leveraging the collective strength of young people. A specific task must be carried out through a specific organizational form. At present, the Chenliu County Communist Youth League Committee mainly relies on shock brigades or groups to promote the work when carrying out relatively large-scale work, and has achieved results.

Finally, pay attention to summarizing the results of the battle and issuing rewards. Young people have a strong sense of honor, especially collective honor, which can best encourage them to move forward bravely. At present, the League organizations at all levels in Chenliu County have mostly learned to use this method. Their reward methods include: posting honor rolls, hero stages, awarding honorary certificates, honorary plaques, medals, books, sportswear, and so on.

    围绕中心工作　发挥青年特长
    徐长荣
    在河南省陈留县住了五天。五天内，我的心情几乎一时也没有平静下来。这里两万多名农村青年的劳动热情，使你不得不振奋，不激动，不歌唱。这些青年热情、勇敢，有朝气、有理想、有希望。
    但是，在过去，这里青年团县的领导上却不能完全理解他们，他们不善于按照青年的特点来进行工作。他们夸大了青年的缺点，说他们没有技术，没有经验，“身小力薄”不中用。因而团的工作显得没有生气，死气沉沉。在工作方法上，企图把党委的工作全包下来，否则就觉得没有劲头。每一次党委有什么布置，他们就把这些指示改头换尾，加上“协助”、“带头”等字眼，发给团的各级组织。他们认为“党委走大路，团委走小路，路道不同，但目的是一个！”这样，就给团的基层干部带来很多苦恼，“狗咬刺猬”无从下口。不少团员都埋怨团的干部说：“带头，光叫带头，究竟带到什么时候才算到头呢？”有的甚至编成这样的快板，来讽刺团的工作：“党的身子，团的帽，团的工作老一套，布置下来马后炮！”
    青年联成群，好似马达开油门
    是去年麦收以后，陈留平原好久没有下雨，土地干梆梆的，一锄头一股白烟，没有办法播种。农民靠天吃饭的思想仍然十分严重，他们说“人忙天不忙，天忙只一场”，早晚天总会下雨的。一时，农村工作几乎陷于瘫痪状态。针对这种情况，中共陈留县委会发出了紧急指示，号召全县农民动员起来，组织点种抗旱。但农民没有点种抗旱的经验，认为“河水浇着碱，井水浇着寒”，就是点种上也没用。有的说“长虫过路，星星眨眼啦”，还能等多少天不下雨！
    在这以前，团县委就注意到了别的地方建立青年突击队的情况，青年团河南省委会也向全团提出过，团的工作方法应该是：“随着中心，抓住特殊，表扬突出，坚持到底。”现在，青年团陈留县委会联想到这一切，决定组织青年突击抗旱，来突破这一缺口。
    一个晴朗的夜晚，在胡寨乡，二十四个青年男女组成的抗旱点种突击队出发了。他们担着水桶，拿着盆儿，扛着锄头，走向干枯的土地上。一时，豫剧“花木兰”的唱词、“五星红旗迎风飘扬”的歌声，荡漾在原野的上空。它，冲破了夜间的寂静，也冲击着人们的烦恼。在场里睡觉的老年农民被惊醒了，他们用惊异的眼光望着这支队伍。
    这伙年轻人，一夜就点种了五亩三分地！
    五天过去了。五亩三分土地穿上了青绿的新装，这就用事实告诉人们：人定能胜天！
    接着，团县委召开了区团委书记的会议，介绍胡寨乡青年突击抗旱点种的经验，并组织参观，编发通报，号召全县青年突击抗旱点种。中共陈留县委会也在团委的通报上加了批示，指示各级党的组织大力领导青年人开展这一工作。自此，雷声，闪光，龙虎，长江……青年突击队相继成立，一个规模宏大的抗旱点种突击运动，在全县范围内开展起来。据四十一个乡的统计，共点种了两万四千九百八十九亩。点种的玉米，每亩最高收了三百多斤，而播种晚的每亩还收不到二百斤。
    突击队完成了生产任务，同时也成为教育青年的学校。万寨乡有四个青年妇女，过去不爱劳动。这次受了突击队的鼓舞，走上田间，第一次和大家生活在一起。其中万荣花还学会了驾辕，以后光荣地加入了青年团。阎呈岗乡有个女青年，一天三换衣服，就是不爱劳动。现在，她同样积极参加劳动，并且被评为乡的劳动模范，加入了青年团。
    事实教育了团的干部，鼓舞了团的干部，使他们在实践中懂得青年人富有热情、坚毅、勇敢，敢于向旧习惯斗争，以及怎样按照青年的特点来开展团的独立活动，他们的结论是：“青年联成群，好似马达开油门！”
    自此，陈留县团的工作有了根本的转变。以后，团县委根据党委每时期的中心工作，给青年出了许多题目，开展了一系列的有益活动。比如说保苗治虫，防涝排水，万车青年突击积肥周，冬季打井浇麦等等。在每次活动中，他们差不多都编有快板诗，来表达自己的理想，歌颂自己的英勇行为。这里，引证两首：
      “打深井，下深井，保证咱们的麦丰产。计划打井三丈五，井深水好浇麦田，为了社会主义工业化，为了旱田变水田，为了每亩千斤收，为了全面能增产！”
    “突击队，真英勇，打井浇麦称英雄。青年赛赵云，老年赛黄忠，社长赛过诸葛亮、突击队员赛武松。营盘扎在麦地里，男女老少齐出征！”
    原队作战，就地突击
    去冬今春，农业合作化的高潮席卷了整个陈留平原。很快，农民就都加入了高级农业生产合作社（除极少数的地主、富农外）。全县农业高级合作化的完成，标志着农村生产关系的根本转变。农村的正规生产开始了，劳动组织也严密起来，每个社、队的生产都按照计划进行。一切，都和过去不同了。
    但，团县委和团内广大干部的工作，并没有很快赶上这一新形势。他们仍沉醉于那种过了时的形式，企图仍组织几百人的大型突击。这样做的结果，使团的基层干部到处碰壁：社委会不允许打乱他们的生产计划，随便抽人出去；年轻人的生产有了定额，也不乐意去进行大型突击活动。这样，团的号召就没有力量，连召开个会议也极困难，团的基层干部非常苦恼。他们说：如今团的工作必须闯过三关（党支部书记、社长和队长）才行。
    7月，县的团代表大会召开了。会上，代表们讨论了高级合作化以后如何开展团的独立活动的问题。讨论中，大家的思想才逐步明确起来，确定今后团的工作方针是：“原队作战，就地突击。”
    陈留县历年缺乏牲口的饲料，民间有“每到三月半，牲口没有饭”的传说。由于饲料不足，去冬今春全县就有一千多头牲口死亡。今年，高产作物耕地面积增加了，再加上麦收时雨水大，麦秸、麦糠霉烂很多，饲草问题更加严重。团县委研究了这一情况，根据“原队作战，就地突击”的方针，主动提出了“五千万斤青贮竞赛月”的计划，发动全县青年来完成这一任务。
    中共陈留县委会对这一行动给予有力支持，并指示各级党的组织给他们配备力量，提供时间。开始，旧习惯的阻力仍然妨碍工作正常进行，不少人都不相信饲草可以青贮。团干部也没有青贮经验，因而开始只在曲兴乡作重点试验。这个乡开始只青贮了五十窖玉米秆，但四十多天后掘出看时，每窖都是清香扑鼻，一点也没有霉烂。事实使大家受到了教育，青贮运动很快在全县开展起来。据9月23日的不完全统计，全县共有青贮队、组七百五十八个，共青贮饲草一千一百六十窖，九千五百多万斤。据在十四个乡的抽查，绝大部分都合乎标准。
    在9月28日各乡团总支书记的电话会议上，团县委又重新做了布置，要求继续开展这一工作，并转入青贮花叶、树叶和青草。
      究竟该怎么办？
    陈留县团的工作经验说明，要使团的工作有生气，首先要主动依靠党的领导，取得党的信任。在过去，中共陈留县委会对如何使用团的组织力量，也是极不明确的。县委书记柳竹三说：“过去我光听见团的干部和青年叫唤当助手，但究竟怎么助法，我思想上也不明确。”因而那时党对团采取了“一揽子”的领导方法，党和团的关系也不密切，团的干部存有消极情绪。自去年团组织了青年突击抗旱以后，党委才具体地体会到团组织的作用。柳竹三同志说：“党团关系紧凑了，密切了，温暖了。”因而，党委经常研究团的工作，和团的干部交换意见，在许多团的重大活动中，柳竹三同志都亲自去做具体指示，利用团的组织去“突破缺口”。
    其次，组织适应任务需要的战斗形式，注意发挥青年的集体力量。一定的任务，必须通过一定的组织形式来进行。目前，陈留团县委在开展规模比较大的工作时，主要是依靠突击队或组来推动工作，而且取得了成绩。
    最后还要注意总结战果，发布奖励。青年人富有强烈的荣誉心，特别是集体的荣誉，最能鼓励他们勇往直前。目前，陈留县团的各级组织大都学会了采用这一办法。他们奖励的办法有：上光荣榜、英雄台、颁发光荣证、光荣匾、奖章、图书、运动衣等等。
