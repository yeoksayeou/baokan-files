    Indonesia Fights Against Colonialism and for World Peace
    Hu Jin
    The people of the East have awakened. Countries liberated from the shackles of colonialism are entering the international arena one after another as sovereign states, participating in determining the fate of the world. The Republic of Indonesia is one such country.
    Indonesian President Sukarno once said that the basic line he has consistently adhered to in leading the Indonesian national liberation struggle is "to resist colonialism, strive for national independence, and strive for a just and prosperous society for the people of Indonesia and the people of the world." He also pointed out that today Indonesia's goals are: first, to achieve complete political independence; second, to build a just and prosperous society; and third, to contribute to the cause of safeguarding world peace.
    Since declaring its independence in 1945, Indonesia has experienced a difficult and tortuous road. Bankrupt colonialist forces have repeatedly attempted to restore their rule in Indonesia and continue to occupy West Irian, an indivisible part of Indonesian territory, by armed force. They have tried their best to maintain their monopoly and control over Indonesia's economy, cultivate and develop armed bandits, and carry out divisive and subversive activities. Greedy colonialists thought that they could no longer stay in Indonesia in the old way, but they could still live a good life there under a different guise. However, the Indonesian people did not retreat in the face of these difficulties. They have always held high the clear banner of anti-colonialism, firmly grasped the destiny of the country in their own hands, and given a powerful response to all the colonialists' conspiracies.
    In March of this year, the new government of Sastroamidjojo further strengthened the unity of the people across the country and took more resolute steps in the struggle and construction: it abolished the "Round Table Conference Agreement" of the Dutch colonialists, which seriously violated Indonesia's sovereignty; it announced the establishment of the province of West Irian in order to strive to recover this sacred territory; it decided to fight against armed bandits in the country supported by foreign colonialist forces; at the same time, it began to formulate the first five-year plan to achieve industrialization and develop the national economy, in order to get rid of the control of foreign monopoly capital and change the colonial economy into an independent and prosperous economy.
    The anti-colonialist struggle on the economic front is of decisive significance to Indonesia's struggle for complete independence. Indonesia has abundant resources and a hardworking people. It can rely on its own efforts to achieve national industrialization. At the same time, it is also necessary to develop foreign economic relations and obtain foreign aid to accelerate the development of economic construction. However, Indonesia firmly opposes unequal foreign economic relations and refuses to accept foreign aid with enslaving conditions. Indonesia abolished the unequal financial and economic agreements imposed by the Dutch colonialists, cancelled the huge debts to the Netherlands, adopted measures to protect the development of national capital, and decided to abolish the "embargo." During his visit to the United States, President Sukarno stated that Indonesia "wants to accept aid, no matter where it comes from, but we would rather work bare-handed in our land and jungles than exchange any part of our freedom for any kind of aid." This is a manifestation of the noble will of a nation that has undergone a long and heroic struggle to cherish its independent sovereignty.
    In order to develop its national economy, Indonesia needs a long-term peaceful international environment. Therefore, Indonesia firmly opposes the Cold War, opposes joining military blocs, advocates disarmament and the prohibition of the testing, production, and use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and is committed to striving for negotiated solutions to international disputes and easing international tensions. At the same time, Indonesia actively supports the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and promotes friendly and cooperative relations with Asian and African countries, socialist countries, and other countries on this basis.
    All patriotic forces in Indonesia deeply understand that their struggle to eliminate the remnants of colonialist forces and influences at home is inseparable from the struggle of Asian and African countries and the people of the world against colonialism. Indonesia has bravely plunged into the torrent of the world's anti-colonialist struggle and has become an important force in this torrent. The Indonesian people resolutely support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan, the Indian people's struggle to recover Goa, and the struggles of other Asian and African countries to win independence and freedom and defend national sovereignty. Recently, Indonesia firmly stood by the Egyptian people, supported the Egyptian people's action to recover the Suez Canal Company, and opposed the attempts of the United States, Britain, France, and Israel to retake the Suez Canal by force and conspiracy. This attitude of the Indonesian government and people in upholding international justice has been valued and welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world.
    Indonesia is one of the initiators of the Asian-African Conference, and it has played a significant role in uniting Asian and African countries in the struggle for independence and the maintenance of peace. The Indonesian government has repeatedly pointed out that the implementation of the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference and the promotion of the "Bandung Spirit" are the foundation of its foreign policy. After the Asian-African Conference, Indonesia's friendly relations with Asian and African countries have developed further, and its unity with Asian and African countries has become more consolidated. As Indonesian leaders have pointed out, strengthening the unity and cooperation of Asian and African countries is an important condition for striving for the complete liberation of the Asian-African region.
    In recent years, friendly and cooperative relations between Indonesia and China, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries have developed well. Last year's mutual visits between Premier Zhou Enlai of our country and Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo of Indonesia have advanced the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries. This year, Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of our country, was invited to visit Indonesia. Now, President Sukarno is visiting China after visiting the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. This mutual visit will greatly strengthen the close ties between each other in all aspects. There is no doubt that the joint efforts of socialist countries, Asian and African countries, and other peace-loving countries for peace and international cooperation on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence will further expand and consolidate the peace zone. This will be a powerful guarantee for maintaining lasting world peace and eliminating the threat of another war.
    Thanks to the joint efforts of peace-loving people all over the world, the international situation has tended to ease. However, international reactionary forces who hate peace and national independence still cling to the policy of "strength" and colonialist attempts and exert pressure on all countries that advocate peace and neutrality. Nixon, Dulles, and their ilk have maliciously and openly attacked neutralism as so-called "outdated and immoral." President Sukarno has sternly refuted the nonsense that neutralism is "immoral," and he has clearly pointed out that Indonesia's foreign policy is "independent and active," "we are not neutral until all mankind in the world has obtained freedom," "we do not intend to withdraw from the struggle of the world. … Our interest lies in a peaceful world, and we are taking action, and will continue to take action, in order to make that situation a reality." That is to say, the foreign policy pursued by Indonesia aims to defend national independence, strive for the freedom of all mankind, maintain peace, and promote international cooperation.
    As a result of Indonesia's active implementation of a peaceful and independent foreign policy, its international prestige has been greatly enhanced, and it has made more friends in the struggle against colonialism, in defense of national independence, and in building its own motherland. Now, Indonesia is appearing on the world stage as a major Asian power, and its future is unlimited.

    印度尼西亚为反对殖民主义、维护世界和平而斗争
    胡今
    东方人民已经觉醒。从殖民主义枷锁中解放出来的国家，一个接着一个地作为主权国家进入国际舞台，参加决定世界的命运。印度尼西亚共和国就是这样的国家之一。
    印度尼西亚总统苏加诺曾经说，他在领导印度尼西亚民族解放斗争中一贯坚持的基本路线是“反抗殖民主义，争取民族独立，和为印度尼西亚人民和全世界人民争取正义和繁荣的社会。”他又指出，今天印度尼西亚的奋斗目标是：第一、达到政治上的完全独立；第二、建设一个公正而繁荣的社会；第三、为保障世界和平事业作出贡献。
    印度尼西亚在1945年宣布独立以来，经历了艰难曲折的道路。破了产的殖民主义势力，几次企图在印度尼西亚复辟，并且继续武装占领着印度尼西亚领土不可分割的一部分——西伊里安。它们竭力企图保持对印度尼西亚经济的垄断和控制，培植和发展武装匪徒，进行分裂和颠覆活动。贪婪的殖民主义者以为，它们已不能按照旧的方式在印度尼西亚呆下去了，但还可以改头换面地在那里过好日子。但是，印度尼西亚人民并没有在这种困难面前退却。他们始终高举着反殖民主义的鲜明旗帜，牢牢地把国家的命运掌握在自己手里，给了殖民主义者的一切阴谋活动以有力的回击。
    今年3月，沙斯特罗阿米佐约的新政府，进一步加强了全国人民的团结，采取了更加坚决的斗争和建设的步骤：废除了荷兰殖民主义者严重侵犯印度尼西亚主权的“圆桌会议协定”；宣布西伊里安建省，以争取收回这一神圣领土；决定对国内受外国殖民主义势力支持的武装匪徒进行斗争；同时，开始制定实现工业化和发展民族经济的第一个五年计划，以摆脱外国垄断资本的控制，把殖民地经济改变为独立的繁荣的经济。
    在经济战线上的反殖民主义斗争，对于印度尼西亚争取完全独立的斗争具有决定性的意义。印度尼西亚拥有丰富的资源，勤劳的人民，它能够依靠自己的努力，实现国家的工业化，同时它也有必要发展对外经济关系，取得外援，以加速经济建设的发展。但是，印度尼西亚坚决反对不平等的对外经济关系，拒绝接受附有奴役性条件的外援。印度尼西亚废除了荷兰殖民主义者所强加的不平等的财政经济协议，取消了对荷兰的巨额债务，采取保护民族资本发展的措施，决定取消“禁运”。苏加诺总统在访美期间曾表明，印度尼西亚“要接受援助，不管是从那里来的，可是，我们宁愿赤手空拳地在我们的土地上和丛林中进行劳动，也不愿意拿我们任何一部分自由去交换任何种类的援助”。这是经过长期英勇奋斗的民族珍爱自己的独立主权的崇高意志的表现。
    为了发展自己的国民经济，印度尼西亚需要一个长期的和平的国际环境。因此，印度尼西亚坚决反对冷战，反对参加军事集团，主张裁军和禁止原子武器、氢武器的试验、生产和使用，致力于争取协商解决国际争端，缓和国际紧张局势。同时，印度尼西亚积极支持和平共处的五项原则，并在这个基础上促进同亚非国家、社会主义国家及其他国家间的友好合作关系。
    印度尼西亚的一切爱国力量都深深懂得，他们在国内肃清殖民主义残余势力和影响的斗争，是同亚非国家和全世界人民反对殖民主义的斗争分不开的。印度尼西亚英勇地投入了世界反殖民主义斗争的洪流，成了这个洪流中的一股重要力量。印度尼西亚人民坚决支持中国人民解放台湾的斗争、印度人民收回果阿的斗争以及其他亚非国家争取独立自由、捍卫国家主权的斗争。最近，印度尼西亚坚决站在埃及人民一边，支持埃及人民收回苏伊士运河公司的行动，反对美英法以武力威胁和阴谋诡计重新夺取苏伊士运河的企图。印度尼西亚政府和人民这种伸张国际正义的态度，受到了全世界爱好和平的人民的重视和欢迎。
    印度尼西亚是亚非会议的发起国之一，它在团结亚非各国争取独立、维护和平的斗争中起了重大的作用。印度尼西亚政府一再指出，实现亚非会议的决议，发扬“万隆精神”，是它的外交政策的一个基础。亚非会议以后，印度尼西亚同亚非国家的友好关系更加发展了，它同亚非国家的团结也更加巩固了。正如印度尼西亚领导人所指出的，亚非国家的团结和合作的加强，是争取亚非地区的彻底解放的重要条件。
    近年来，印度尼西亚同中国、苏联和其他社会主义国家之间的友好合作关系有了良好的发展。去年我国周恩来总理和印度尼西亚沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理的互相访问，已使两国的友好合作关系推进了一步。今年，我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会宋庆龄副委员长应邀访问了印度尼西亚。现在，苏加诺总统在访问苏联和其他社会主义国家以后访问中国。这种相互访问将大大加强相互之间在各方面的紧密联系。毫无疑问，社会主义国家、亚非国家和其他爱好和平的国家，在和平共处的五项原则上为和平和国际合作而进行的共同努力，将进一步扩大和巩固和平地区。这将是维护世界持久和平，消除另一次战争威胁的有力保证。
    由于全世界爱好和平的人民的共同努力，国际局势已经趋向和缓。但是，仇视和平和民族独立的国际反动势力，仍然死死抱住“实力”政策和殖民主义的企图不放，对一切主张和平中立的国家滥施压力。尼克松、杜勒斯之流竟恶毒地公开攻击中立主义是所谓“过时的，不道德的”。苏加诺总统曾严正地驳斥了所谓中立主义“不道德”的胡说，他并明确地指出，印度尼西亚的外交政策是“独立的和积极的”，“在全世界人类获得自由以前，我们不中立”，“我们不打算从世界的斗争中脱身出来。……我们的利益在于一个和平的世界，我们在采取行动，而且将继续采取行动，以便使那种局面得以实现”。这就是说，印度尼西亚所奉行的外交政策，是以捍卫民族独立、争取全人类的自由、维护和平和促进国际合作为目标的。
    印度尼西亚积极执行和平独立的外交政策的结果，它的国际威望已经大大提高，并且使它在反对殖民主义、维护民族独立、建设自己祖国的斗争中有了更多的朋友。现在，印度尼西亚正以一个亚洲大国的姿态出现在世界舞台上，前途未可限量。
