Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th: Six public-private joint factories under the Shenyang Agricultural Machinery Industry Company have established a mass quality inspection network, significantly improving the quality of their products. For example, of the more than 5,000 double-wheel double-share plows, seeders, disc harrows, and rollers produced since July, there have been almost no returns for repair. More than 800 hillside plows, corn threshers, soybean cake crushers, and other products manufactured before October 20th also meet quality requirements.

In each production team in every workshop, these six factories have elected a worker with better technical skills to serve as the quality team leader. They are responsible for inspecting the first component, correcting tools and dies, and improving operating methods. If they encounter difficulties, they consult with quality inspectors to resolve them. Once, a quality inspector at the Hexing Iron Factory mistakenly verified a substandard product as合格品(qualified), but the quality team leader discovered it and immediately asked the inspection section chief to re-inspect it, preventing defective products from leaving the factory.

In the past, these six factories lacked strict quality inspection systems, and the quality of their products was very poor. In June of this year, the Agricultural Machinery Industry Company sent personnel to the Chengyuan Iron Factory to help establish a mass quality inspection network, which promoted the improvement of product quality. The other five factories have since推广(popularized) this experience.

    沈阳六个公私合营工厂
    建立群众性的质量检查网
    新华社沈阳28日电　沈阳市农业机械工业公司所属六个公私合营工厂建立群众性的质量检查网，使出厂产品的质量显著提高。如7月份以来出厂的五千多台双轮双铧犁、播种机、圆盘耙和镇压器，几乎完全没有返修品。10月20日以前出厂的八百多台山地犁、玉米脱粒机、豆饼粉碎机等产品，也符合质量要求。
    这六个厂在各个车间的每个生产小组里都推选一名技术较好的工人担任质量组长，负责检查第一个部件，校正工具胎具，改进操作方法，如果遇到困难，就跟质量检查人员商量解决。合兴铁工厂质量检查员有一次把一件不合格品误验为合格品，质量组长发现后立即找检查股长重新检验，防止了废品出厂。
    这六个工厂过去没有严格的质量检查制度，产品质量都很低劣。今年6月间，农业机械工业公司派人到成源铁工厂帮助建立了群众性的质量检查网，促使产品质量提高。其他五个工厂随着推广了这一经验。
