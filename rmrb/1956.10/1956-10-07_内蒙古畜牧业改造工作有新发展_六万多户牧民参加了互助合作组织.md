Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 4th: Socialist transformation of animal husbandry in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has recently made new progress. According to statistics, 515 animal husbandry production cooperatives have been established throughout the region (including 19 advanced cooperatives), with 15,952 herdsmen households participating, accounting for 18.89% of the total number of herdsmen households. In addition, more than 51,000 herdsmen households have organized more than 3,100 animal husbandry mutual aid teams. Herdsmen households participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations now account for 80% of the total number of households in pastoral areas.

After implementing mutual aid and cooperation, herdsmen have improved the feeding and management of livestock. In the Hulunbuir and Xilingol grasslands, the survival rate of more than 1.4 million young animals produced this year reached over 95%. The main pastoral areas of the autonomous region have completed the 1956 livestock breeding plan.

In addition to implementing labor division, improving animal husbandry technology, and improving livestock breeds, many pastoral cooperatives have also begun to build artificial feed bases and settlements. Pastoral cooperatives in Ulanqab, Chahar, and other five leagues have opened up more than 167,000 mu of feed bases. Pastoral cooperatives in Xilingol League are building permanent housing, and some cooperatives have established nurseries and childcare groups.

In order to consolidate the established pastoral cooperatives, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued instructions to all leagues and banners to carry out rectification work in the cooperatives again. The instructions pointed out that the current focus should be on resolving the issue of income distribution in pastoral cooperatives to ensure that the vast majority of members can increase their income. At the same time, through the rectification work, it is necessary to check the implementation of the voluntary and mutually beneficial policies, summarize the operation and management of pastoral cooperatives, revise the cooperative charters, formulate next year's production plan, prepare for winter and spring disaster prevention and livestock protection, and strengthen the party's leadership and political work in pastoral areas.

    内蒙古畜牧业改造工作有新发展
    六万多户牧民参加了互助合作组织
    新华社呼和浩特4日电　内蒙古自治区畜牧业社会主义改造工作最近有了新的发展。据统计，现在全区已建成畜牧业生产合作社五百一十五个（其中高级社十九个），入社牧户为一万五千九百五十二户，占牧户总数的18.89％；此外还有五万一千多户牧民组织了三千一百多个畜牧业互助组。参加互助合作组织的牧户已占牧区总户数的80％。
    牧民实行互助合作后，改进了对牲畜的饲养管理。呼伦贝尔和锡林郭勒两大草原，今年生产的一百四十多万头仔畜，成活率达到95％以上。自治区的主要牧区已经完成了1956年牲畜增殖计划。
    许多牧业社在实行劳动分工，提高畜牧技术，改良牲畜品种以外，还开始建设人工饲料基地和定居地。乌兰察布、察哈尔等五个盟的牧业社开辟了十六万七千多亩饲料基地，锡林郭勒盟的牧业社正在建筑定居房屋，有些社已建立了托儿所和育儿小组。
    为了巩固已经建成的牧业社，中共内蒙古自治区委员会最近已向各盟、旗发出指示，再次展开整社工作。指示中指出：当前应着重解决牧业社的收益分配问题，保证绝大多数社员都能增加收入。同时，通过整社工作要检查自愿互利政策的执行情况，总结牧业社的经营管理，修订社章，制定明年生产计划，做好过冬过春防灾保畜准备工作，加强牧区党的领导和政治工作。
