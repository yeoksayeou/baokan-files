Xinhua News Agency, October 15th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Feng reports: The state-owned Beijing Electron Tube Factory officially started production today. The reporter interviewed Professor Meng Zhaoying, member of the Technical Sciences Division of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and director of the Electron Tube Teaching and Research Group of the Department of Radio Engineering at Tsinghua University; Wu Xijiu, a master of electronics who returned from the United States in June and is now working at the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Zhou Guoquan, the chief engineer of the Beijing Electron Tube Factory; and other experts about the significance of the factory's completion.

    The Heart of Radio

    These experts pointed out that the electron tube is the heart of radio. The effectiveness and technological advancement of radio depend mainly on electron tubes, just as the quality of a radio depends primarily on the electron tubes. The production of electron tubes and radio components is the foundation of the radio industry; only with a modern electron tube factory can we talk about an independent radio industry at the world's advanced level. Professor Meng Zhaoying said that a country's national economy, scientific culture, and national defense are backward without the application of electronics. The more developed these aspects, the more electron tubes are needed.

    The experts cited many examples to illustrate the importance of electron tubes in the development of science and technology. They said that an electronic computer with the functions of memory, translation, organization, and statistical scientific data requires tens of thousands of electron tubes. This kind of electronic computer can already successfully solve problems in mathematics, modern mechanics, chemistry, and meteorology. Research in astronomy, such as the manufacture of artificial satellites, and all natural science research departments cannot do without electron tubes. A physiologist who wants to observe and record the activity of the human brain when thinking can only do so with instruments made with electron tubes.

    To develop broadcasting, a large number of electron tubes are also needed. An ordinary radio uses four or five electron tubes, a good radio uses more than a dozen, and a television receiver uses more than twenty. In industrialized countries, on average, there is one radio or television set for every few people. The number of electron tubes needed for our country with a population of 600 million to reach this level is imaginable.

    In industrial production, instruments for observing the internal working conditions of steelmaking furnaces, iron smelting furnaces, etc., and for observing underwater buildings, the application of automatic control and remote control technology, and the construction of automated factories, mines, and power stations all require well-performing electron tubes, especially in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    Some experts said that a large country like ours needs a large number of electron tubes not only to develop the radio telegraph and telephone industry, but also to build a modern national wired telephone network. Without electron tubes, only two people can talk on a line at the same time, and they can only be heard within a certain distance. By applying electron tubes, many telephone calls can be made on one line at the same time. Currently, our country's general telephone lines only have three telephone calls, and only a few lines have twelve telephone calls. If there are excellent or special electron tubes, one line can have twenty-four or even more than a thousand telephone calls at the same time, and people's soft speech can be transmitted tens of thousands of kilometers. The convenience and clarity of the sound during a conversation are the same as in the city.

    Other experts said that modern military equipment in various countries, such as communication equipment, radar used to detect enemy aircraft and ships hundreds of miles away in the air or at sea, all require a large number of electron tubes with very good performance. Nowadays, some countries need thousands of electron tubes on one bomber, and several thousand on a cruiser.

    The Starting Point for Building the Radio Industry

    The experts said that many countries attach great importance to the radio industry, especially after the Second World War. Many countries have placed the radio industry in a very important position, and its development has been very rapid. Radio has only been around for sixty years, and electron tubes have only been invented for more than fifty years, but the United States now has thousands of large and small radio companies, and can produce hundreds of millions of electron tubes every year. The development of the Soviet Union's radio industry after the war has also been extremely rapid.

    The experts said that the Beijing Electron Tube Factory is China's first modern electron tube factory. Its production volume and variety are still far from meeting the needs of industrial production, scientific and cultural undertakings, etc. in our country. Our country needs to build many such factories to catch up with the world's radio industry level. This modern electron tube factory is only a starting point for building our country's radio industry, but it is a very good starting point. Although our country has only one modern electron tube factory, it still lacks the technical personnel and skilled workers it needs. This clearly shows how important and urgent the task of training electrovacuum technology talents is, because old China did not leave us any legacy in this regard. When talking about this issue, some experts recalled the history of China's mastery of electrovacuum technology. The experts said that China only had a three-person electrovacuum research laboratory in 1935. In 1937, China began to establish a light bulb factory in Changsha, Hunan Province, and planned to assemble electron tubes with American parts. However, before production could begin, the factory was moved to Guilin and other places due to the Japanese invaders' attack, and most of the equipment was burned down in Dushan, Guizhou. Some technical personnel went abroad and some changed careers, and old China's electrovacuum industry died prematurely. After the liberation of Nanjing, an electroplating factory in Nanjing established an electron tube group and quickly developed into the current Nanjing Electron Tube Factory. Although its production performance is very good, the equipment is old and the output is relatively small. World-Class Technical Equipment

    After recalling the situation of China's learning electrovacuum technology in the past thirty years to the reporter, the experts talked about the Beijing Electron Tube Factory, which the Soviet Union helped China build, and all believed that this factory is very important for China to master electrovacuum technology and develop the radio industry. Master Wu Xijiu said that the equipment of the Beijing Electron Tube Factory, which the Soviet Union helped China build, is undoubtedly world-class. The experts said that this allows China's electronics industry to be built on the world's first-class technical equipment level from the very beginning. In this way, China can also learn to design this kind of factory, cultivate electrovacuum technology talents and conduct scientific research at such an advanced level, and further develop this science and technology. When Master Wu Xijiu talked about this issue, the reporter casually mentioned the concerns he expressed to the reporter shortly after returning to China: whether there would be factories in the motherland to provide convenient conditions for electronics research work. Master Wu Xijiu smiled and said: That kind of concern is a common concern among students studying abroad. Now it seems that it is certainly unfounded.

    Every expert the reporter visited clearly pointed out that semiconductor devices can already replace electron tubes in some aspects in the past eight years, and they are lighter, smaller, more power-saving, and have a longer lifespan than electron tubes. Our country needs to vigorously strengthen this new scientific research work. However, many people in China believe that semiconductors can completely replace electron tubes, and some people who study electrovacuum technology also believe that there is no need to study electron tubes. This idea is wrong. Experts in electrovacuum technology and semiconductors all believe that semiconductors cannot replace electron tubes with very high frequency and power, nor can they replace cathode ray tubes that convert electricity into visible images. In application, the two have their own strengths and complement each other. At the same time, most countries in the world cannot mass-produce semiconductors like electron tubes.

    The experts unanimously believe that it is currently very necessary to clarify the understanding of semiconductors and electron tubes, which involves the principle of developing the radio industry. There is no doubt that building more electron tube factories like Beijing is an important foundation for building our country's modern radio industry.

    中国电子学专家孟昭英等谈
    北京电子管厂建成的重大意义
    新华社15日讯　新华社记者李峰报道：国营北京电子管厂今天正式开工生产了，记者曾就这个工厂建成的意义，分别访问了中国科学院技术科学学部委员、清华大学无线电系电子管教研组主任孟昭英教授，今年6月间从美国回国现在中国科学院工作的电子学硕士吴锡九，北京电子管厂的总工程师周国铨及其他专家。
    无线电的心脏
    这些专家们指出，电子管是无线电的心脏。无线电的效能和技术的提高与发展，主要取决于电子管，正像大家熟知的，收音机的好坏主要是取决于电子管一样。电子管和无线电零件的生产，是无线电工业的基础；有了现代化的电子管厂，才能谈到独立的世界先进水平的无线电工业。孟昭英教授说，一个国家的国民经济、科学文化和国防等任何方面，没有电子学的应用就是落后的，这些方面愈发达，所需用的电子管愈多。
    专家们举出了许多事例，说明电子管对于发展科学技术方面的重要性。他们说，一个具有记忆、翻译、整理和统计科学资料等效能的电子计算机，就需要上万支电子管。这种电子计算机，已经可以成功地解决数学、近代力学、化学、气象学上的问题。制造人造卫星等天文学方面的研究，以及一切自然科学研究部门，没有不用电子管的。一个生理学家要观察和纪录人的大脑想事情的时候的活动，也只有用电子管等制成的仪器才能办到。
    要发展广播事业，也需要大量的电子管。一个普通收音机要用四、五支电子管，一个好的收音机要用十几支；一架电视接受机要用二十多支。在工业发达的国家，平均几个人就有一架收音机或电视机，我们六亿人口的大国，要达到这样的水平，需要的电子管之多是可以想像的。
    在工业生产上，观察炼钢炉、炼铁炉等内部工作情况和观察深水下面的建筑物的仪器，应用自动控制和远距离操纵技术，建设自动化工厂、矿山和电站，都必须有性能良好的电子管，特别是和平利用原子能方面更是如此。
    有的专家说，像我们这样大的国家，不仅发展无线电电报电话事业需要大量的电子管，即使要建设现代化的全国有线电话网，也需要很大数量的电子管，因为没有电子管，一条线上只能有两人同时通话，而且只能在一定距离内听到；应用电子管，一条线就可以同时通好多路电话。我国目前一般电话线仅仅三路电话，只有个别线路有十二路电话。如果有优良的或特种的电子管，在一条线上，可以同时有二十四路甚至一千多路电话通话，可以把人们轻声说话的声音传送上万公里，双方通话时其方便和声音清晰，如同在市内一样。
    还有的专家说，各国现代化的军事装备，如通讯器具，侦察数百里以内的空中或海洋上敌方的飞机和船舰用的雷达等，都需要大量的性能十分优良的电子管。现在世界上有些国家的一架轰炸机上，就需用上千支电子管，一艘巡洋舰要用几千支。
  建设无线电工业的起点
    专家们说，许多国家都很重视无线电工业，特别是第二次世界大战以后，许多国家都把无线电工业放在极重要的地位，发展十分迅速。无线电才有六十年的历史，发明出电子管也才有五十多年的时间，但是美国现在已经有几千家大小无线电企业，每年可以生产几亿支电子管。苏联战后无线电工业的发展也极为迅速。
    专家们说，北京电子管厂是我国第一个现代化的电子管厂，他的产品数量和品种，离我国工业生产、科学文化事业等方面的需要，还相差很远很远；我国要赶上世界无线电工业的水平，还需要建设许多这样的工厂。这个现代化的电子管厂，仅仅是建设我国无线电工业的一个起点，但这是个极良好的起点。我国虽然还只有这么一个现代化的电子管厂，可是它所需要的技术人员和技术工人，仍然很缺乏。这就明显地看出，培养电真空技术人才的任务是何等重大而迫切了。因为旧中国在这方面没有给我们留什么遗产。谈到这个问题时，有的专家回忆了中国掌握电真空技术的历史。专家们说，1935年中国才有了一个三个人的电真空研究室，1937年中国在湖南省长沙开始建立灯泡厂，计划附带地用美国的零件装配电子管；但是未等开工生产，因为日本侵略者的进攻而迁厂桂林等地，最后大部分设备烧毁在贵州独山。技术人员有的出国有的改行，旧中国的电真空企业就此夭折。南京解放以后，南京一个电照工厂设立了电子管组，并且迅速发展成了现在的南京电子管厂，虽然它的生产成绩很好，但是设备旧，产量也比较小。世界第一流的技术装备
    专家们向记者忆述过去三十年中国学习电真空技术的处境以后，谈到苏联帮助我国建设的北京电子管厂，都认为这个厂对我国掌握电真空技术和发展无线电工业是十分重要的。吴锡九硕士说，苏联帮助我国建设的北京电子管厂的设备，毫无疑问是世界上第一流的。专家们说，这就使我国的电子工业，从开始打基础就建立在世界第一流的技术装备水平上。这样，我国也就可以学习设计这种工厂，在这样先进的水平上培养电真空技术人才和进行科学研究，进一步发展这种科学技术。吴锡九硕士谈到这个问题时，记者随便提起了他在回国以后不久向记者所表示的疑虑：回到祖国能否有工厂来为电子学研究工作提供便利条件。吴锡九硕士笑了笑说：那种疑虑是国外留学生普遍的疑虑，现在看来那当然是没有根据的。
    记者访问的每一位专家，都明确地指出，近八年来，半导体器件已经在某些方面可以代替电子管，而且它比电子管轻小，省电，寿命长，我国需要大力加强这门新的科学研究工作。但是，国内不少人认为半导体可以完全代替电子管，有些学习电真空技术的也认为不需要学习电子管了。这种想法是不对的。研究电真空技术和半导体的专家们都认为，半导体并不能代替频率和功率很高的电子管，也不能代替把电变成能够显像的阴极示波管，在应用上，两者各有所长，相互为辅，同时目前世界各国还不能像电子管这样大量制造半导体。
    专家们一致认为，目前澄清对半导体与电子管的认识是非常必要的，这涉及发展无线电工业的原则问题。毫无疑问，建设更多的像北京这样的电子管厂，是建设我国现代化的无线电工业的重要基础。
