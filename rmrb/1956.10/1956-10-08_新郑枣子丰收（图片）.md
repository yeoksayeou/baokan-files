    Bumper Harvest of Xinzheng Dates
    Xinzheng County in Henan Province is famous for its dates, which are known for their small kernels, thick flesh, sweet taste, and absence of worms. This year, Xinzheng County has had a bumper date harvest, estimated to yield over nine million jin of dried dates. This is a corner of the date-drying yard of the First Agricultural Cooperative in Mengzhuang Township. Little Meng Xianyun has also come to dry dates.

    新郑枣子丰收
    河南省新郑县出产的枣子，以核小肉厚、味甜无虫著名。今年新郑县的枣子丰收，估计可产干枣九百万斤以上。这是孟庄乡第一农业社晒枣场的一角。小朋友孟先云也来晒枣了。
