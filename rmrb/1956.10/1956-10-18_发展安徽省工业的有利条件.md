Favorable Conditions for the Development of Industry in Anhui Province
Li Renzhi, Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Among some cadres in Anhui, there are two kinds of opinions. One is that the industrial development of Anhui in recent years has been too slow. The basis for this is: the total industrial output value of the province only accounts for 1.08% of the national industrial output value, and 12% of the total industrial and agricultural output value of the province (excluding handicrafts). In addition, state-owned industries only account for 6.06%, and more than 75% of the means of production and consumer goods are transferred from other provinces every year, and this is increasing year by year. The other is that Anhui's industry cannot be developed, the reason being: Anhui is located between the coast and the interior, with no industrial base and not being an object for industrial development, so industrial development is very difficult. Are these statements correct? We think they are incorrect. Anhui's industry can be developed, and the development speed in recent years has been very fast.

Why can Anhui, which is located between the coast and the interior and has a very weak industrial base, develop industry? We believe that the first is the need to develop industry. Anhui is a province with a population of more than 30 million and nearly 100 million mu of land. The means of production and consumer goods are far from meeting the needs of agricultural production development and the growing needs of the people's lives. Especially due to the weak original industrial base, it is even more necessary to develop industry. In addition, since Anhui is located between the coast and the interior, it has the obligation to support the coastal areas, so it not only needs to develop light industry, but also needs to develop small-scale heavy industry. The second is that there are favorable conditions for developing industry. Anhui Province has great potential for developing cash crops such as cotton, tobacco, silkworms, hemp, soybeans, and oil crops, as well as abundant resources of copper, iron, coal, sulfur, phosphorus, and many rare metals. Anhui has convenient transportation, easy access to power sources (hydroelectric power), and is close to the coast, especially Shanghai, where there is an opportunity to "be the first to get the moon near the water." Therefore, the conditions for developing industry are favorable. The third is the correct policy of the Party. In their reports at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai both put forward the issue of rational industrial layout, pointing out that industrial enterprises should be close to natural resources; that industry and the entire national economy should develop in a balanced way; and that the favorable conditions of the coastal provinces should be fully utilized to help the development of inland industries. They also criticized the past shortcomings and errors of some central departments in paying insufficient attention to the development and unified arrangement of local industries, and also criticized the blind construction and expansion of some industrial projects by some local leading organs. Under these correct policies, I think that the industry in every region of the country can be developed in the coming period of time. As far as the past few years are concerned, although individual newly built enterprises have been subjected to some unreasonable restrictions or have not adapted to the requirements of the overall economic development due to our insufficient response. But in general, the support and help that Anhui's industry has received is very great, and the development speed is also very fast. In terms of newly built and expanded projects in recent years, there are a total of 232 projects. In terms of investment, there is a total of 23,178.7 yuan (including central state-owned). In terms of output value, it has increased four times from 1950 to 1955, with an average annual increase of 38%. This figure is not small. Therefore, those who believe that Anhui's industrial development is too slow and that Anhui's industry cannot be developed are obviously unfounded worries.

Of course, there are problems in the development of Anhui's industry, such as technical problems, funding problems, and geological resource exploration problems, which are all difficult for us. However, the facts of the past few years tell us that these difficulties can be solved. In terms of funding, due to our attention to the issue of increasing production and practicing economy, in recent years, incomplete statistics from departments including industry, commerce, grain, transportation, basic construction, and administration have saved the country a total of 15.304 million yuan. In addition, the annual increase in grain production, with an average annual increase of 16.7%, has increased the people's purchasing power and guaranteed tax revenue, which has also played a role in capital accumulation. In terms of technology, in recent years, the technical force has been strengthened by adopting methods such as sending people to study, extracting people for further studies, entrusting people with training, and hiring people, especially the guidance of higher authorities, and the quality of most products has been significantly improved and meets national standards. The exploration of geological resources has also made considerable progress recently. However, our foundation is still extremely weak, and we still have many shortcomings. Based on past experience, in order to change the backward situation of Anhui's industry, in addition to relying on our own efforts, the main thing is to rely on the strong support and help of the relevant central departments.

    发展安徽省工业的有利条件
    中共安徽省委书记  李任之
    在安徽的某些干部中有两种舆论，一种是说安徽几年来的工业发展太少，根据是：全省工业总产值只占全国工业总产值的1.08％，占全省工农业总产值的12％（手工业不在内），除国营工业外，只占6.06％，每年从外省调进的生产资料和生活资料占75％以上，而且年年增加。一种是说安徽工业不能发展，理由是：安徽处在沿海与内地之间，既无工业基础，又非发展工业的对象，所以工业发展很困难。这种说法是否对呢？我们认为是不对的。安徽的工业是能够发展起来的，而且几年来的发展速度也是很快的。
    处在沿海与内地之间而工业基础又很薄弱的安徽为什么能够发展工业呢？我们认为，第一是有发展工业的需要。安徽是一个有三千多万人口，有将近一亿亩土地的省份，生产资料和生活资料远不能满足农业生产的发展和人民生活日益增长的需要。特别是由于原有工业基础薄弱，所以更需要发展工业。另外还由于安徽是处于沿海与内地之间的地区，它负有支援沿海地区的义务，所以不仅需要发展轻工业，而且还有发展小型重工业的需要。第二是有发展工业的有利条件。安徽省有发展棉花、烟叶、蚕桑、麻类、大豆、油料等经济作物的广大潜力，也有铜、铁、煤、硫、磷及许多稀有金属的丰富资源。安徽交通便利，电源容易解决（水电），又接近沿海，特别是接近上海，技术方面有“近水楼台先得月”的机会。所以发展工业的条件是有利的。第三是党的正确方针。刘少奇同志、周恩来同志在中国共产党第八次全国代表大会上的报告里，都提出了关于合理的工业布局问题，指出了要使工业企业接近自然资源；要使工业和整个国民经济得到平衡的发展；指出了要充分利用沿海各省的有利条件，以帮助内地工业的发展，批判了过去某些中央部门对于地方工业的发展和统一安排注意不够，也批判了某些地方领导机关盲目新建和扩建一些工业的缺点和错误。在这些正确的方针下，我想全国每一个地区的工业在今后一定的时间内都是可以发展起来的。就以前几年来说，虽然个别新建企业，由于我们反映不够，受到过某些不合理的限制或者没有适应整个经济发展的要求。但总的说来，安徽工业所得到的支持和帮助是很大的，发展速度也是很快的。几年来以新建扩建的项目计算共二三二个，以投资计算共二三、一七八·七元（包括中央国营），以产值计算从1950年到1955年共增长到四倍，平均每年增长38％，这个数字是不小的。因此那些认为安徽工业发展太少和安徽工业不能发展的说法，很显然是一种没有根据的忧虑。
    当然，对安徽工业的发展不是没有问题的，如技术问题，资金问题，地质资源的勘查问题等，对于我们来说都是有困难的。但是几年来的事实告诉我们，这些困难都是可以解决的。就资金来说，由于我们注意了增产节约问题，几年来包括工业、商业、粮食、交通运输、基本建设、行政等部门不完全的统计，共为国家节约一五，三零四万元。另外由于粮食产量年年增加，平均每年递增16.7％，提高了人民购买力，保证了税收，对于资金的积累也是起了作用的。就技术来说，几年来由于采取了派出学习，抽出进修，委托代训，托人聘请等等办法，特别是上级的指导，技术力量已有所加强，多数产品质量都有显著提高，符合国家标准。地质资源的勘查工作，最近也有相当的发展。但是我们的基础还是极为薄弱的，我们的缺点还是很多的，根据以往的经验，要将安徽工业落后的情况加以改变，除依靠自己的努力外，主要的还是要靠中央有关部门的大力支持和帮助。
