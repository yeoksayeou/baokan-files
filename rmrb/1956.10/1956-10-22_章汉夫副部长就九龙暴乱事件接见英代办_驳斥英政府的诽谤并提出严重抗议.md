Xinhua News Agency, October 21st: Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China met with British Chargé d'Affaires Mr. O'Neill on October 19th. Chargé d'Affaires O'Neill stated that he was instructed by the British government to make further representations to the Chinese government regarding the Kowloon riot. He said that the British government believes that the cause of the Kowloon riot is still under investigation, and that accusations and conclusions from all parties, including the Chinese side, are premature. Regarding the failure of the British authorities in Hong Kong to take effective measures to stop the riot, he again defended. He even claimed that the British government believes that Chinese newspapers and commentaries have exaggerated the facts in reporting the Kowloon riot, and protested against this. He also said that the Chinese government's protest to the British government means that the Chinese government is using this incident to seek political capital.

Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu sternly refuted these unreasonable opinions of the British government. He first pointed out that the Kowloon riot was organized and instigated by Kuomintang secret agents. This is a fact witnessed by Chinese and foreign residents in Kowloon and acknowledged by many news agencies and reporters. The British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong have so far refused to admit this fact, but instead exonerate the Kuomintang secret agents and shirk their responsibilities. The Chinese government has repeatedly protested against this attitude of the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong, but the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong have not changed this attitude so far, and the Chinese government cannot but express its extreme dissatisfaction and indignation.

Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu then said that the protests and demands made by the Chinese government regarding the Kowloon riot were completely reasonable. He pointed out that the Chinese government has every right to demand that the British authorities in Hong Kong earnestly protect the Chinese residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon and the organs and enterprises affiliated with the Chinese government. The British authorities in Hong Kong bear an unshirkable responsibility for the significant loss of life and property of Chinese residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon. However, not only does it not take responsibility, but it also intentionally exonerates the Kuomintang secret agents. Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu sternly refuted the Hong Kong Governor Grantham's insinuation at a press conference on October 16 that the Chinese government's protest was interference in internal affairs, and expressed that the Chinese government protested against this unfounded statement.

Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu further pointed out that the British authorities in Hong Kong are currently sheltering and condoning Kuomintang secret agents in using Hong Kong and Kowloon as a base for sabotage work against the Chinese mainland. He said that this is completely based on facts. He cited the incident of the sabotage of the Kashmir Princess plane in Hong Kong, the incident of Chiang Kai-shek's F-86 fighter jets intruding into the mainland and then fleeing to Hong Kong, and the recently uncovered case of the Hong Kong Kuomintang secret service dispatching and directing Kuomintang secret agents to plot riots in Guangzhou. Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu emphasized that the behavior and attitude adopted by the British authorities in Hong Kong towards the Kowloon riot provides another factual basis. It is these facts that truly constitute interference in China's internal affairs, which the Chinese government will never tolerate, and therefore lodges a strong protest with the British government.

Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu pointed out that Chinese newspaper news and commentaries are based on facts, and expressed that he could not accept the protest raised by Chargé d'Affaires O'Neill.

Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu criticized with great indignation the claim that the Chinese government was using this incident to seek political capital, pointing out that this was a completely unfounded slander and an extremely unfriendly attitude. The Chinese government has the right and the responsibility to protest and demand with regard to the Kowloon riot, and also reserves the right to make demands in the future. This attitude of the British government has a detrimental impact on Sino-British relations, which the Chinese government cannot accept at all, and protests against.

Chargé d'Affaires O'Neill promised to immediately report the above-mentioned protests and demands of Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu to the British government.

    章汉夫副部长就九龙暴乱事件接见英代办
    驳斥英政府的诽谤并提出严重抗议
    指出香港英国当局包庇和纵容国民党特务分子利用港九作为对中国大陆进行破坏工作的基地，真正构成了对中国内政的干涉，中国政府决不能容忍
    新华社21日讯　中华人民共和国外交部章汉夫副部长于10月19日接见英国代办欧念儒。欧念儒代办说，他奉英国政府指示对九龙暴乱事再向中国政府申述意见。他说，英国政府认为九龙暴乱起因还在调查中，目前包括中国方面在内的各方面的指责和结论都为时过早。关于香港英国当局未能采取有效措施制止暴乱，他再度进行辩护。接着，他竟然声称英国政府认为中国报纸新闻和评论对九龙暴乱作了夸大事实的报道，并且对此提出抗议。他还说，中国政府向英国政府提出的抗议是意味着中国政府正在利用这一事件寻求政治资本。
    章汉夫副部长严正地驳斥了英国政府这些无理的意见。他首先指出，九龙暴乱是国民党特务分子所组织和策动的，这是九龙中外居民所目睹，并且为许多通讯社和记者的报道所承认的事实，英国政府和香港英国当局迄今还不肯承认这一事实，却相反地为国民党特务分子开脱罪行，为自己推卸责任。中国政府对英国政府和香港英国当局这种态度曾经一再提出了抗议，但是英国政府和香港英国当局至今没有改变这种态度，中国政府对此不能不表示非常的不满和愤慨。
    章汉夫副部长接着说，中国政府对九龙暴乱事件所提出的抗议和要求是完全合理的。他指出：中国政府完全有权利要求香港英国当局切实保护港九中国居民和中国政府所属机关和企业。香港英国当局对港九中国居民生命财产的重大损失负有不容推卸的责任。但是，它不但不负起责任，反而有意为国民党特务分子开脱罪行。章汉夫副部长对香港总督葛量洪10月16日在记者招待会上所暗示的中国政府提出抗议是干涉内政的说法给予严正驳斥，并且表示中国政府对这种毫无根据的言论提出抗议。
    章汉夫副部长进一步指出：香港英国当局正在包庇和纵容国民党特务分子利用港九作为对中国大陆进行破坏工作的基地。他说，这是完全有事实根据的。他举出了克什米尔公主号飞机在香港被破坏的事件、蒋介石集团F—86战斗机窜扰大陆后逃降香港的事件和最近破获的香港国民党特务机关派遣和指挥国民党特务阴谋在广州发动骚乱的案件。章汉夫副部长强调指出，香港英国当局对九龙暴乱所采取的行为和表现的态度提供了又一个事实的根据。正是这些事实真正构成了对中国内政的干涉，中国政府决不能容忍，为此，向英国政府提出严重抗议。
    章汉夫副部长指出中国报纸新闻和评论是根据事实的，对欧念儒代办所提抗议表示不能接受。
    章汉夫副部长十分愤慨地批评了所谓中国政府利用这一事件寻求政治资本的说法，指出这是完全没有根据的诽谤，是极其不友好的态度。中国政府有权利而且有责任对九龙暴乱事件提出抗议和要求，并且还保留在今后提出要求的权利。英国政府这种态度对中英关系起着危害性的影响，对此中国政府完全不能接受，并且提出抗议。
    欧念儒代办答应立即将章汉夫副部长上述抗议和要求报告英国政府。
