    Pig Raising
    Yequ
    Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, pork became scarce again. I hadn't tasted meat for weeks. People living in the city have to queue up at two or three in the morning, and they may not be able to buy pork. As for me, living far away in the suburban countryside, if I wanted to eat meat, I'd probably have to ask the female worker to go queue up at twelve o'clock at night (there's no bus at night). Of course, I wouldn't be selfish enough to make a female worker suffer in the middle of the night just to eat pork. But after all, people are people. Usually, although I don't particularly like pork, not eating it for a long time makes me crave it, and gradually I really want to eat pork.

    One day, I was having lunch when a comrade from the township came to see me. He saw only a bowl of salted fish and a bowl of rapeseed on the table and exclaimed "Ah!"

    I said with a melancholy tone, "I haven't had meat for more than twenty days!"

    "It's hard to buy!" he said. "Pork is scarce again!"

    "It's simply impossible to buy! And it's going to be scarce until April or May next year. I remember it was like this last year!" I said. "I heard there's some kind of pork coupon. It's good to have pork coupons. People with pork coupons also queue up, but it's easier to buy. Does the township have pork coupons?"

    "The township doesn't have pork coupons. But I do!" the comrade from the township replied with a smile.

    "How do you have them?" I asked curiously.

    "I raise pigs myself! If you raise pigs and sell them to the public, for each pig you sell, the public gives you fifteen pork purchase coupons, one coupon per pound."

    "Oh! Is that so!" I said, "Can you give me two? Would that be possible? Two would be enough for me!" Because I really wanted to eat pork, I brazenly said directly.

    "Sure, sure, I'll give you three," said the comrade from the township.

    "Hey!" I laughed and said, "Teach me how to raise pigs! I'm going to raise pigs! Raise one, raise it..." I was very happy with my wonderful plan.

    "Ha! Ha! Ha!" The comrade from the township laughed aloud, completely guessing my personal intentions, and interrupted me, saying, "No! The regulations stipulate that if you raise one, you must sell it to the public. If you raise two pigs, you sell them to the public. If you raise three pigs, you sell them to the public. If you raise four pigs, you still sell them to the public. Only if you raise five pigs can you slaughter one for yourself!"

    "Ah," I said, "Then I'd rather not raise them."

    "And the feed is so difficult to obtain! People feel that since they can't eat any themselves anyway, and they still have to queue up even with pork coupons, they find it troublesome and unprofitable, so they'd rather not raise them. We have to mobilize them, but they're still unwilling! I'm raising them to take the lead!" the comrade from the township said. "If fewer families raise pigs, pork will naturally be scarce!"

    I thought: The people who made these pig-raising regulations must have thought that with this regulation of raising five pigs to slaughter one for oneself, people would raise five, six, seven... a lot of pigs, but they didn't expect that people would simply not raise even one.

    养猪
    野渠
    在中秋节以前，猪肉又紧张起来了。我有数周不知肉味。住在城里的人们，在早上二、三点钟就得去排队，可还不一定能买到猪肉。我呢，远在郊区乡村，如果想吃肉，恐怕在半夜十二点钟就得叫女工走了去排队（夜间没有公共汽车）。当然我还不至于自私到这样，为了要吃猪肉，叫女工半夜三更去受罪。可是人毕竟还是人，平时，我虽不爱吃猪肉，长久不吃，却也有些馋起来了，慢慢地简直非常想吃猪肉。
    这天，我正吃午饭，乡里的一位同志来看我，他看见饭桌上只有一碗咸鲞和一碗油菜，“呀”了一声。
    我带着惆怅的口吻说：“我已经有二十多天吃不到肉了！”
    “难买呀！”他说：“猪肉又紧张了！”
    “简直买不到！而且，一直要紧张到明年四、五月里，我记得的，去年也是这样！”我说：“听说有一种猪肉票的，有猪肉票就好了，有猪肉票的人也排队，不过容易买到。乡里有没有猪肉票？”
    “乡里没有猪肉票。但是我有！”乡里的同志笑着回答我。
    “你怎么会有的？”我好奇地问。
    “我自己养猪呀！养了猪，卖给公家，卖一只猪，公家给我购猪肉的票十五张，一斤一张。”
    “哦！是这样的！”我说：“你送我两张罢？能不能？送我两张就够了！”因为实在想吃猪肉，我就老着脸孔直爽地说。
    “可以，可以，我送你三张。”乡里的同志说。
    “嗨！”我笑起来了，说：“你教我，怎么样养猪！我要养猪啦！养一只，养来……”我很高兴自己美妙的计划。
    “哈！哈！哈！”乡里的同志出声笑起来了，完全猜着了我的个人打算，打断我的话说：“不行！规定养一只必得卖给公家，养两只猪卖给公家，养三只猪卖给公家，养四只猪还是卖给公家，养五只猪才可以自己杀一只！”
    “呀”我说：“那我只好不养。”
    “饲料又是这样困难！人家觉得反正自己什么也吃不到，有了猪肉票还是要去排队。人家嫌麻烦，无利可图，宁可不养，我们只得去动员，人家还是不愿呢！我是为了起带头作用而养的呀！”乡里的同志说：“猪肉呢，养猪的人家少，猪肉当然就紧张啦！”
    我想：制定这些养猪规定的人，一定以为有了这个养五只猪才可以自己杀一只的规定，人家会养五只、六只、七只……很多的猪，而没有料到人家索性连一只也不养的罢。
