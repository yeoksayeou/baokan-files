    A Statement
    Zhong Zi Wang

    The sixth issue of this year's "Historical Research" published a statement by Mr. Guo Moruo: retracting and correcting his past assertion that the peasant revolutionary hero Li Zicheng was martyred at Jiugong Mountain in Tongcheng County, Hubei, and agreeing with the research of some historians that Li Zicheng should have died at Jiugong Mountain in Tongshan County, Hubei.

    Why bring up this statement? Is it out of interest in the fact that this famous scholar made a mistake? No. Nor is it that there is anything more to say about the death of Li Zicheng. In my opinion, this statement, placed in the academic community, should draw attention to the issue of attitude in conducting academic research.

    The so-called "attitude" simply requires "seeking truth from facts," but this is not easy to achieve. Since the launch of the Hundred Schools of Thought campaign, the academic community has pointed out that there have been many phenomena of not seeking truth from facts. For example, some people often enshrine their own views as "authoritative arguments," being "uniquely correct," while others simply consider the views of others as "beneath consideration," and never admit defeat. Therefore, when seeing Mr. Guo Moruo's statement, one cannot help but feel a sense of rarity.

    A scholar in the Qing Dynasty once said: "Scholars do not let others obscure themselves, nor do they obscure themselves." This spirit of scholarship can be said to be a virtue. Seeking knowledge without clinging to the coattails of others, or echoing what others say, requires independent research and independent thinking. Having one's own "thesis," one does not "obscure oneself," and is not "uniquely correct," with the views of others being "beneath consideration."

    Mr. Guo Moruo originally believed that Li Zicheng should have died at Jiugong Mountain in Tongcheng County, Hubei, which was not without basis. The issue is that when a more reliable claim emerged, he was willing to immediately retract and correct his own claim. This is "not obscuring oneself." This kind of scholarly attitude should be convenient for both oneself and others. This is the attitude of "seeking truth from facts."

    To say more! We advocate the Hundred Schools of Thought in academics, and many issues require exploration and research. An issue can certainly be discussed for two, three, or even five or six years, or even longer. But for academics, we might as well suggest that when exploring issues, one should not avoid looking at what others are saying, so-called "selecting from various opinions to decide which is superior." If one finds that one's own claim has some merit, one can completely "persist in one's own views"; if one finds that one's own claim is a bit off, finding a place in a newspaper or magazine to write a statement is also necessary, and there is no need to talk about "admitting defeat." "Academic integrity" should be like this.

    一篇声明
    锺子望
    今年第六期的“历史研究”刊载了郭沫若先生一篇声明：注销和改正了他过去关于农民革命英雄李自成殉难在湖北通城县九宫山的说法，同意一些史学家的考证李自成应该是死在湖北通山县九宫山。
    为什么要提起这一篇声明呢？是为了这位著名的学者出了一个错误而感到兴趣吗？不是。也不是对于李自成之死还有什么话要说。我看，这一条声明，放在学术界，应该说引起注意的是从事学术研究的态度问题。
    所谓“态度”，无非要求“实事求是”，可是这还并不容易做到。从开展百家争鸣以来，学术界就曾指出以前存在有许多不实事求是的现象。如有些人经常把自己的见解封为“权威之论”“唯我独尊”，还有的人对于别人的见解干脆就认为“不屑一顾”，从来不肯向人“认输”等等。因此，当看到郭沫若先生的这一篇声明，就不能不有稀罕之感了。
    清朝有一位学者曾说：“学者不以人蔽己，不以己自蔽”，这种治学精神可以说是一种美德。探求学问不附人骥尾，人云亦云，这要靠自己独立钻研，独立思考。自己有了“立论”，也不“自蔽”，不是“唯我独尊”，别人的东西都成为“不屑一顾”。
    郭沫若先生原来认为李自成应该是死在湖北通城县九宫山，也不是毫无根据，问题在于更可靠的说法出来了，而肯于马上注销和改正自己的说法，这就是“不以己自蔽”。这种治学态度，对己对人应该说是皆大方便。这就是“实事求是”的态度。
    话多说一些呢！我们学术上提倡百家争鸣，许多问题都要求探讨、研究。一个问题固然可以两年、三年，甚至五年、六年，或者要更长的时间讨论下去。可是对于学术家来说，我们也不妨提示一下，探讨问题也不避忌多看看别人是怎么说的，所谓“择于众说，以裁其优”，发现自己的说法有些道理，完全可以“固执己见”；如果发现自己的说法有点不对头，在报纸或刊物上找出一个地位写一则声明，也还有其必要，也谈不到什么“认输”。“学术本色”是应该如此的。
