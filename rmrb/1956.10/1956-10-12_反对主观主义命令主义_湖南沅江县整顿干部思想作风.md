Opposing Subjectivism and Commandism
Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province Rectifies Cadre Ideological Style

    (Report from our newspaper) Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, in conjunction with summarizing the lessons learned from the early rice yield reduction, has made considerable achievements in the rectification study movement centered on opposing subjectivism and coercive orders. The secretary of the Yuanjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the members of the County Committee took the lead in conducting self-examinations and personally went deep into the fields to jointly study effective measures with the masses to strive for a bumper late rice harvest. After the self-examinations, many agricultural cooperative cadres began to change their work style, and the pessimistic and disappointed emotions of the masses due to the early rice yield reduction also began to reverse, with renewed confidence in increasing production.
    This year, the early rice, which accounts for 76% of the county's total paddy field area, averaged just over 350 jin of grain per mu, a more than 30% reduction compared to last year's early rice. Many cooperative members complained that the cooperative cadres should not have blindly expanded the planting of double-cropping rice and promoted japonica rice, and some wealthier cooperative members wanted to withdraw from the cooperative; agricultural cooperative cadres generally felt that the production increase plan could not be completed, and they could not account to the higher authorities or the cooperative members, creating a difficult situation for both superiors and subordinates, and causing pessimism and disappointment. Some agricultural cooperative cadres even dared not meet with cooperative members. In early August, the Yuanjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a series of meetings, using the spirit of criticism and self-criticism to mobilize the masses to examine the work of the past period. Many cooperative members who originally complained about the cooperative cadres have now turned around to examine their own mistakes in production.
    Through this mass self-examination, the reasons for this year's early rice yield reduction were found. The most valuable lesson to be learned is the subjectivist and coercive commandist work style in leading agricultural production.
    This is first manifested in the agricultural technology reform work, where it was not possible to adapt well to local conditions, and there was an eagerness for quick success and rash advance. This year, in order to achieve the county's thousand-jin bumper harvest plan, it was required that 90% of the county's paddy fields be planted with double-cropping rice, and actually more than 80% was achieved. The double-cropping rice area increased by one and a half times compared to last year. This county has always felt that there is insufficient labor and fertilizer, and this has made the problem even more serious. This year, each able-bodied laborer in the county was responsible for cultivating approximately 14 mu of land, while the "rush autumn" time for harvesting early rice and rushing to transplant late rice is generally only two weeks. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor, this year, many paddy fields were forced to be harvested early when only 70-80% of the rice had ripened, causing great losses. Some district and township leaders even blindly demanded that 100% of the paddy fields be planted with double-cropping rice, and even low-lying fields, autumn-tilled fields, and lean fields were forced to be planted with double-cropping rice. As a result, these early rice fields were either waterlogged to death, or the seedlings were still yellow after being transplanted for ten or twenty days, and finally had to be plowed and replanted. This year, the county had more than 40,000 mu of early rice fields that were blindly expanded for double-cropping rice, resulting in no harvest. This item alone will reduce the production of more than 9 million jin of rice.
    In the work of carrying out agricultural technology reforms, many cadres did not adopt the methods of typical demonstrations and persuasive education, but rather adopted the crude method of "commanding production." For example, the Nan Da Shan District formulated a so-called "production increase action program" for the entire district according to the subjective wishes of the district leaders, and declared, "Whoever violates the action program will be responsible for the production reduction." If the masses had different opinions, they would be labeled with big hats such as "conservative," "backward," and "saboteur," and the masses dared not speak. Some cooperative members who did not act according to the "orders" of the cadres were forced to rework, deduct work points, and even violence and other illegal acts occurred. Some cooperative members of the Fu Dong Agricultural Cooperative believed that deep mud fields and lean fields were not suitable for planting double-cropping rice at present, and secretly sowed medium rice seedlings that could be transplanted to more than 50 mu of paddy fields. The then township branch secretary, Gong Shaoqing (who has now been expelled from the party for corruption, suppression of democracy, and other behaviors), discovered this and destroyed all the medium rice seedlings; some cooperative members saw that there was little fertilizer this year and appropriately planted a few more seedlings per clump, but were considered to have violated the regulations of "eight inches between rows, eight seedlings per clump" and were all forced to rework. This year, the average yield of early rice in this cooperative was only 266 jin of grain per mu, a 50% reduction compared to last year. The masses have a lot of complaints.
    This year, the county universally promoted planting "frame seedlings" and using cultivators for weeding. The masses resisted this idea, some dragged the cultivator across the grass surface, and as a result, some cooperatives this year appeared with "three-story" seedlings: a layer of barnyard grass on top, a layer of grass on the bottom, and a sparse layer of rice in the middle.
    This year, the county also promoted more than 20,000 mu of early japonica rice. These varieties are something that the local masses have never seen before. Because the masses did not master the cultivation techniques of japonica rice and lacked fertilizer, this year the yield was only 121 jin per mu. This item alone reduced production by at least more than 3.4 million jin of rice.
    After the self-examination, everyone deeply realized the harm of subjectivism and commandism and determined to change this ideological style in their work. (Hu Jian)

    反对主观主义命令主义
    湖南沅江县整顿干部思想作风
    本报讯　湖南省沅江县结合总结早稻减产教训，开展的以反对主观主义和强迫命令为中心内容的整风学习运动取得不少成绩。中共沅江县委书记和县委委员们都带头进行检查，并亲自深入田间，和群众共同研究争取晚稻丰收的有效措施。经过检查，许多办社干部开始改变工作作风，群众因早稻减产而产生的悲观失望的情绪也开始扭转，增产信心再度高涨起来。
    今年这个县占稻田总面积76％的早稻，平均每亩收谷三百五十多斤，比去年早稻减产三成多。许多社员抱怨社干部不该盲目扩种双季稻和推广粳稻，个别富裕的社员闹退社；农业社干部普遍感到增产计划完不成，对上级对社员都交不了账，上下为难，悲观失望。有个别农业社干部甚至不敢和社员见面。八月初，中共沅江县委召开了一系列的会议，以批评与自我批评的精神，发动群众对过去一段工作进行了检查。许多原来抱怨社干部的社员，现在转过头来检查自己在生产中的错误了。
    通过这次群众性的检查，找出今年早稻减产的原因。最值得吸取的教训是：在领导农业生产中的主观主义和强迫命令作风。
    这首先表现在农业技术改革工作中，不能很好地因地制宜，存在着急躁冒进情绪。今年这个县为了实现全县千斤丰产计划，要求全县90％的稻田插上双季稻，实际做到80％以上。双季稻面积较去年增加一倍半。这个县历来感到劳动力和肥料不足，这样一来，问题就更严重了。今年全县每个整劳动力负担的耕地约十四亩，而抢收早稻赶插晚稻这一段“赶秋”时间，一般仅两个星期。为解决劳动力不足的困难，今年有不少稻田仅七、八成黄熟就被迫提早收割，造成很大损失。有些区、乡领导上甚至盲目地要求100％的稻田插上双季稻，连低洼田、翻秋田、瘦田也被迫插上了双季稻。结果这些早稻田不是被渍死，就是插下一、二十天还是黄秧，最后只好犁掉改种。今年全县像这样盲目扩种双季稻早稻因而颗粒无收的有四万多亩。单这一项，也要减产九百多万斤稻谷。
    在进行农业技术改革工作中，有不少干部不是采取典型示范、说服教育的方法，而是采取“命令生产”的粗暴作法。如南大膳区就按照区领导上的主观愿望订出全区所谓“增产行动纲领”，并扬言“谁违反行动纲领，减产由谁负责”。群众如有不同意见，就被干部扣上“保守”、“落后”、“破坏”等大帽子，群众不敢说话。有些社员没有按照干部“命令”办事，就被迫返工、扣工分，甚至发生打骂等违法行为。福东农业社有些社员认为深泥脚田和瘦田目前不适宜插双季稻，就偷偷地播种了能插五十多亩稻田的中稻秧苗，给当时的乡支部书记龚绍卿（现已因贪污、压制民主等行为开除党籍）发觉，把中稻秧苗全部毁掉了；有些社员们看到今年肥料少，每蔸适当多插了几根秧苗，就被认为违反“行行八寸，蔸蔸八根”的规定，全部返工。今年这个社的早稻平均每亩只收二百六十六斤谷；较去年减产一半。群众意见很大。
    今年全县普遍推行插“架子禾”和使用中耕器除草，群众思想抵触，有的拖着中耕器在草面上滑过去，结果有些社里今年出现了“三层楼”的禾苗：上面一层稗子，下面一层草，中间一层稀落落的稻子。
    今年这个县还推广了两万多亩早粳稻，这些品种是当地群众从来没有见过的。由于群众没有掌握粳稻的栽培技术和缺少肥料，今年每亩只收一百二十一斤。单这一项，至少减产三百四十多万斤稻谷。
    经过检查，大家深刻认识到主观主义、命令主义之危害，决心在工作中改变这种思想作风。　　（胡坚）
