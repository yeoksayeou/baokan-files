Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th. Hong Kong News: According to today's "Wen Wei Po" report, more than two hundred young students in Hong Kong and Kowloon jointly signed a letter to the newspaper on the 28th, accusing Kuomintang secret agent elements of atrocities.

These young students said in the letter: "Kuomintang secret agent elements actually used the anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution to create heinous atrocities in Kowloon Peninsula. This small group of beasts went to kill, set fire, rob, and rape in broad daylight, destroying the peaceful life of Hong Kong and Kowloon residents, and making the entire Kowloon Peninsula permeated with terror and bloodshed." The letter said: "Ironclad facts prove that the Kuomintang secret agent elements' lawless crimes were planned, organized, and premeditated." "We want to ask, why did the atrocities continue for three or four days in the prosperous urban area? Why was the Xiangdao New School burned down after the military and police took over? Why did the Tsuen Wan tragedy occur after martial law was imposed?"

These young students wrote in the letter: "Although the riots have been quelled, we have the right to demand that the Hong Kong government severely punish the culprits and eradicate the root of the disaster; we also ask the Hong Kong government to properly handle the aftermath, and at the same time hope that the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon will extend a helping hand to help the affected compatriots."

The letter concludes: "The desperate struggle of the dying riot cannot scare the compatriots' patriotic hearts, and the crimes of the Kuomintang secret agent elements will surely be subject to just punishment."

    两百多名港九学生写信给“文汇报”
    控诉国民党特务暴行
    新华社广州29日电　香港消息：据“文汇报”今天报道，有两百多名港九青年学生在28日签名联合写信给这家报纸，控诉国民党特务分子的暴行。
    这些青年学生在信中说：“国民党特务分子竟利用辛亥革命纪念日，在九龙半岛制造穷凶极恶的暴行。这一小撮野兽在光天化日下去干杀人、放火、抢劫、奸淫的勾当，破坏了港九和平居民的安宁生活，使整个九龙半岛弥漫着恐怖和血腥。”信里说：“铁一般的事实证明，国民党特务分子无法无天的罪行是有计划、有组织、有预谋的”。“我们要问，为什么暴行竟在繁盛的市区内延续三、四天？为什么香岛新校舍在军警接管后还被焚毁？为什么在戒严令下了后还发生荃湾惨案。”
    这些青年学生在信里写道：“暴乱虽是平息了，但我们有权利要求港府严办祸首，铲除祸根；我们更要求港府妥善办理善后，同时希望港九同胞伸出援助的手，救济受害的同胞。”
    这封信最后说：“垂死挣扎的暴乱是不能吓倒同胞们的爱国心的，国民党特务分子的罪行必定受到正义的制裁。”
