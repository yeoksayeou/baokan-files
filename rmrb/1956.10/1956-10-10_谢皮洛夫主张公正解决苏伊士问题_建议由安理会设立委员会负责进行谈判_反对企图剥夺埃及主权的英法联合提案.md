Xinhua News Agency, New York, 9th -- TASS reports: Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov spoke at the United Nations Security Council meeting on the morning of October 8th, advocating for a peaceful and just resolution to the Suez Canal issue.

Shepilov said that the Suez Canal issue involves the vital interests of many countries and also touches on the fundamental principles of modern international relations. This makes the discussion of this issue in the Security Council particularly important. I believe that the goal of our efforts should be placed on effective and constructive work, that is, to find the best institution to negotiate with Egypt on an equal footing, and then to find the best institution to ensure the freedom of navigation of the Suez Canal based on a correct combination of the interests of the sovereign Egyptian state and the interests of the Canal users.

Security Council's Task is to Find a Fair Solution

Shepilov said that if the members of the Security Council discuss the Suez issue realistically and with due responsibility, they will be able to find an acceptable way to resolve this issue peacefully. The task of the Security Council is precisely to seek a solution that can satisfy the interests of Egypt and the interests of other countries using the canal. The task is to seek a suitable way of cooperation between Egypt, the sovereign country that manages the canal now and in the future, and the canal users.

Shepilov said: What is the road to a peaceful resolution of the Suez issue?

First, the policy of ultimatums, military threats, and economic pressure should be abandoned. Egypt is an independent country, and it demands and has the right to demand that its national sovereignty and national dignity be respected. Second, disputes should and can only be resolved on the basis of negotiations on a completely equal footing between the parties concerned. So far, some have actually refused to hold such negotiations with Egypt. Such negotiations should begin now.

Four Principles that Can Serve as the Basis for International Agreements

After pointing out that Egypt is genuinely willing to negotiate on the canal issue and reach effective international agreements, Shepilov said: The Soviet government believes that the following principles can serve as the basis for such agreements:

First, merchant ships and warships of all countries shall have free passage on the Suez Canal on the basis of equal navigation fees and commercial charges, as well as equal conditions for navigation.

Second, Egypt, which has jurisdiction, possession, and management of the canal, has the following obligations: to ensure complete freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal, to maintain the canal and its buildings, to maintain the canal in a proper state of navigation; to improve navigation conditions to increase the capacity of the canal; and to systematically report the work of the canal to the United Nations.

Third, under no circumstances shall the contracting parties take actions that may damage the inviolability of the canal or cause material damage to its buildings; the Suez Canal should never become a battlefield; nor should it be subject to blockade.

Fourth, ensure appropriate forms of cooperation between Egypt and the canal users.

Shepilov then referred to the Indian government's draft proposal at the first London conference on the Suez Canal issue regarding the establishment of a Suez Canal Advisory Body, which represents the interests of the canal users and has advisory and liaison functions. He pointed out that the Soviet Union does not consider its views on the functions of this body expressed at the first London conference to be complete or unchangeable. Taking into account the requirements of the parties concerned, the issue of the functions of the aforementioned body can be resolved in more detail and more extensively, and it can also be specified more concretely to establish some kind of institution or system for the Suez Canal within the scope of the United Nations, which is also the task of future negotiations.

Negotiating Body Can Be Composed of Egypt, Britain, India, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States

Regarding how to practically ensure negotiations on the Suez issue, Shepilov believes that it is best for the Security Council to establish a powerful committee to be responsible for conducting such negotiations, and its members can be composed of Egypt, Britain, India, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States. He said, of course, we do not intend to absolutely insist that the number of committee members must be completely in accordance with this regulation, although we think this is the best. For example, it is also possible to form an eight-nation committee, that is, in addition to the above-mentioned countries, plus countries such as Yugoslavia and Iran, or Indonesia and Sweden. At the same time, we believe that maintaining a balance of members in the committee is the most important condition, so as not to let some advocacy take advantage in the committee in advance. Only in this case can negotiations be conducted on an equal footing without any discrimination in order to reach a solution agreed upon by all. The committee shall be responsible for reporting the progress of negotiations to the Security Council within the prescribed period. The committee can also be entrusted with drafting a new convention on ensuring the freedom of navigation of the Suez Canal to replace the 1888 Convention. The new convention should take into account the spirit of the times, Egypt's just interests, and the interests of the canal users. This committee can also be entrusted with preparing for a broad international conference with the participation of all Suez Canal users to discuss and approve the new convention on ensuring the freedom of navigation of the Suez Canal.

Before presenting the Soviet Union's proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Suez issue, Shepilov refuted Lloyd's and Pineau's speeches and expressed opposition to the Anglo-French proposal attempting to deprive Egypt of sovereignty.

He cited precedents of Britain, France and other countries nationalizing foreign-invested companies, illustrating that the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company is a legitimate action of the Egyptian state and it is entirely an internal affair of Egypt. Any attempt to hinder Egypt from exercising this inalienable sovereignty will be interference in Egypt's internal affairs. He also refuted the Anglo-French claim that nationalizing the canal company would not guarantee the freedom of navigation of this international waterway, pointing out that the position of the two countries in the Panama Canal issue, recognizing the United States' right to unilateral control, is contradictory to their claims on the Suez Canal issue. He also emphasized that Egypt has already practically proven that it respects the freedom of navigation of the canal, and has also proven that it has the ability to manage the canal.

The West's Policy of Force and Economic Aggression Has Bankrupted

Shepilov also cited various facts, pointing out the Western three countries' policy of force and economic aggression against Egypt and the bankruptcy of this policy, and exposing the selfish intentions of certain monopolistic capital groups in the United States. He pointed out that this conspiracy is not only directed against Egypt and other Eastern countries, but also against the interests of Britain and France.

Shepilov then pointed out that in a short period of time, Western countries have put forward many "solutions" to the Suez issue, but these solutions only change their form and always maintain this substance of treating Egypt unequally. He said that after the Menzies Committee of the Dulles Plan, which attempted to force Egypt to accept "international control" of the canal, failed, Britain and France are currently proposing the so-called "Eighteen-Nation Plan" in their joint proposal to the Security Council, which is also the Menzies Committee's plan, but with a little more embellishment. Some are trying to use the high prestige of the Security Council to suggest that we honor this proposal, with the purpose of presenting certain economic and political conditions to Egypt in the name of the United Nations, the highest international conference venue, instead of in the name of a group of countries.

Western Proposals are Not For a Just Resolution of the Issue

Shepilov said that the plan to establish a "Canal Users Association" also has this characteristic of treating Egypt unequally. The "Canal Users Association" is a narrow organization composed of a certain selection of countries and excluding the participation of dozens of other canal users. People intend to give this organization these functions: adjusting the navigation work of the canal, organizing pilotage work, collecting ship passage fees, etc. Some even suggested that ships carry their own pilots through the canal in the name of the association, ignoring the Egyptian management agencies and the existing canal navigation rules. It goes without saying that this form of association is intended to directly interfere in Egypt's internal affairs, rudely undermine Egypt's sovereignty, and is a provocation against those countries that have a stake in the smooth flow of the canal. Therefore, the fact that the Anglo-French proposal suggests that the Egyptian government cooperate with the "Canal Users Association" established on October 1, 1956, cannot but arouse deep concern. Currently, some want to use the authority of the Security Council to approve unilateral actions of certain governments, and this action is by no means for a just resolution of the Suez issue.

Britain and France Have No Reason to Accuse Egypt to the Security Council

Shepilov pointed out that Britain and France have no reason whatsoever to accuse Egypt to the Security Council, and said that Lloyd's and Pineau's speeches and their joint proposal aroused deep suspicion. Their speeches did not contain any positive program that could serve as the basis for equal negotiations with Egypt, but instead aroused reasonable concerns. For example, the French Foreign Minister said that "taking compromise measures is inappropriate" on the Suez issue, and that "weakness is more dangerous than toughness." What is hidden in such words if not a threat? The Anglo-French proposal is not based on the principle of equal negotiations with Egypt, but in fact once again presents Egypt with ultimatum-style conditions that Egypt cannot agree to and requires Egypt to surrender. Needless to say, on this basis, we will not be able to make any progress on the Suez issue. There is an impression that the Anglo-French proposal is not intended to achieve a positive resolution of the Suez Canal issue, but to pursue goals outside the scope of the United Nations' mission.

Shepilov pointed out that the British and French governments submitted the issue to the Security Council under the pressure of public opinion accusing power politics. But Lloyd's and Pineau's speeches and the Anglo-French proposal prove that the British and French representatives are not committed to seeking a satisfactory resolution of the Suez issue on a just basis, and are not committed to seeking to use the Security Council to make real progress on this troubling issue. The proposal they put forward cannot obtain the recognition they expect in the Security Council.

Shepilov said that putting forward such a proposal means that the ruling groups of Britain and France apparently intend to respond as follows to the solemn demands of the broad masses of the public who hope for a peaceful resolution of the Suez issue: "You demand that we submit to the United Nations. We have done so. We have submitted to the Security Council. But, as you can see, the Security Council is weak and cannot do anything. The method of consultation with Egypt will not produce any results, other measures should be taken. The blame lies with Egypt. Cut it into pieces!"

Some are preparing public opinion in this way in order to condemn Egypt and let go of the next step. But this way of handling things contains extremely serious dangers. This is playing with fire. This approach will not promote us along the road to resolving the Suez issue. This approach will seriously damage the prestige of the United Nations, threaten the interests of peace and security, and will make Britain and France bear serious responsibility for the situation that may arise.

Hope that the Leaders of Britain and France Show Sincerity

Shepilov said that we believe that the leaders of Britain and France are far-sighted and wise, and we believe that they will ultimately not want to complicate the Suez issue, and that they will show sincerity so that they can make constructive contributions to a good resolution of the Suez issue. I hope that, in order to create the atmosphere necessary for effective negotiations and a peaceful resolution of the Suez issue, Lloyd and Pineau will agree to withdraw their proposal, because this proposal cannot lead to any good results. I also hope that we, who are holding a round table meeting here, including the Egyptian representative, will work together to use common wisdom to find the best way to achieve a peaceful and just resolution of the Suez issue.

　　谢皮洛夫主张公正解决苏伊士问题
    建议由安理会设立委员会负责进行谈判
    反对企图剥夺埃及主权的英法联合提案
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫在联合国安全理事会10月8日上午会议上发言，主张和平地、公正地解决苏伊士运河问题。
    谢皮洛夫说，苏伊士运河问题牵涉到许多国家的切身利益，同时也牵涉到现代国际关系的根本原则。这就使得在安全理事会上讨论这个问题具有特别重要的意义。我认为，我们努力的目标应当放在有成效的建设性的工作上，就是设法建立一个同埃及在平等基础上进行谈判的最好的机构，而后设法建立一个在把自主的埃及国家利益同运河使用国利益正确结合的基础上保证苏伊士运河通航自由的最好的机构。
    安理会任务是找寻公平解决办法
    谢皮洛夫说，如果安全理事会理事国现实地和以应有的责任感来讨论苏伊士问题，那就能够为这个问题的和平解决找出可以接受的途径。安全理事会的任务正是寻求一个能够满足埃及的利益和其他使用运河的国家利益的解决办法。任务是，在现在和将来，管理运河的主权国埃及同运河使用国之间寻求一个适当的合作方式。
    谢皮洛夫说：什么是和平解决苏伊士问题的道路呢？
    首先，应当放弃最后通牒、军事威胁和经济压力的政策。埃及是一个独立的国家，它要求并且有权要求它的国家主权和民族尊严受到尊重。其次，争端应当而且也只能在有关方面完全平等地进行谈判的基础上获得解决。到目前为止，有人实际上拒绝同埃及举行这种谈判。现在应当开始这种谈判。
    可作为达成国际协定的四项原则
    谢皮洛夫在指出埃及真正愿意就运河问题进行谈判和达成有效的国际协定后说：苏联政府认为，下列原则可以作为这种协定的基础：
    第一，在通航费和商业费用以及通航的各种条件一律平等的基础上，各国商船和军舰得在苏伊士运河上自由通航；
    第二，管辖、占有和管理运河的埃及负有下列义务：保证苏伊士运河上航行的完全自由、保养运河及其建筑物、维持运河应有的通航状态；改善通航条件以提高运河的通过能力；有系统地向联合国报告运河的工作；
    第三，各缔约国在任何情况下都不得采取可能破坏运河不可侵犯性或使其建筑物遭受物质损失的行动；苏伊士运河始终不应当成为战场；它也不应遭受封锁；
    第四，保证埃及和运河使用国之间适当的合作形式。
    谢皮洛夫接着提到在讨论苏伊士运河问题的第一次伦敦会议上印度政府所提出的关于成立一个苏伊士运河咨询机构的草案，这个机构代表运河使用国的利益，并且赋有咨询的职能和联系的职能。他指出，苏联并不认为它在第一次伦敦会议上就这个机构的职能所发表的意见是完备的或不可更改的。考虑到有关方面的要求，可以更详尽和更广泛地解决关于上述机构的职能问题，而且还可以更具体地规定在联合国范围内为苏伊士运河设立某种机构或制度，这也是将来谈判的任务。
    谈判机构可由埃英印法苏美组成
    关于如何实际保证就苏伊士问题进行谈判的问题，谢皮洛夫认为，最好由安全理事会设立一个有权力的委员会来负责进行这种谈判，其成员可以由埃及、英国、印度、法国、苏联和美国组成。他说，当然，我们并不打算绝对地坚持委员会成员数目一定要完全按照这个规定，虽然我们认为这样是最好的。举例说吧，也可以成立一个由八国组成的委员会，就是除上述各国外，再加上南斯拉夫和伊朗或者是印度尼西亚和瑞典这样的国家。同时，我们认为，在委员会里使成员保持均衡是一项最重要的条件，以免某种主张事先就在委员会中占优势。只有在这种情况下，谈判才能在没有任何歧视的平等基础上进行，以求得大家同意的解决。委员会要负责在规定的时期内向安全理事会报告谈判情况。委员会还可以被委托拟定关于保证苏伊士运河通航自由的新公约草案，以代替1888年公约。新的公约应当考虑到时代精神、埃及的公正利益和运河使用国的利益。这个委员会还可以被委托准备召开一个有一切苏伊士运河使用国参加的广泛的国际会议，以讨论和批准保证苏伊士运河通航自由的新公约。
    在提出苏联关于和平解决苏伊士问题的建议之前，谢皮洛夫驳斥了劳埃德和比诺的发言，并且表示反对企图剥夺埃及主权的英法提案。
    他列举英法等国把外国投资的公司收归国有的先例，说明苏伊士运河公司的国有化是埃及国家的合法行动，它完全是埃及的内政问题。凡是企图阻碍埃及行使它这种不可剥夺的主权的做法，都将是对埃及内政的干涉。他还驳斥了英法所谓把运河公司收归国有就不能保证这条国际水道自由通航的说法，指出英法两国在巴拿马运河问题上承认美国有权单独控制的这种立场同它们在苏伊士运河问题上的主张是互相矛盾的。他并且着重指出，埃及目前已经在实践上证明它尊重运河的通航自由，也证明它有能力管理运河。
    西方的武力和经济侵略政策破产
    谢皮洛夫还列举种种事实，指出西方三国对埃及采取武力和经济侵略政策和这种政策的破产，并且揭露了美国某些垄断资本集团的自私打算。他指出，这种阴谋不仅是针对埃及和其他东方国家的，而且也是针对英法的利益的。
    谢皮洛夫然后指出，在短短的时期内，西方国家提出了许多“解决”苏伊士问题的方案，但是这些方案只是改变形式而始终保持着不平等地对待埃及的这种实质。他说，在企图迫使埃及接受“国际管制”运河的杜勒斯方案的孟席斯委员会遭到失败以后，英国和法国目前在它们向安全理事会提出的联合提案中又一次提出所谓“十八国方案”，这也就是孟席斯委员会的方案，只是多了一点花样而已。有人正在企图利用安全理事会的高度威信建议我们尊崇这个提案，目的是不用一批国家的名义而用联合国这个最高的国际会议场所的名义向埃及提出某些经济条件和政治条件。
    西方建议不是为了公正解决问题
    谢皮洛夫说，成立“运河使用国协会”的计划也有这种以不平等态度对待埃及的特征。“运河使用国协会”是一个由经过一定挑选的国家组成而排除其他几十个运河使用国参加的狭隘组织。人们打算使这一组织有这些职能：调整运河的通航工作，组织引水工作，征收船只通行费等等。有人甚至还建议说，用协会的名义使船队带有自己的引水员通过运河，不理睬埃及的管理机构以及现有的运河航运规则。不言而喻，这种形式的协会是打算直接干涉埃及的内政，粗暴地破坏埃及的主权，而且是对那些同运河的畅通有利害关系的国家的挑衅。因此，英法提案中建议埃及政府同1956年10月1日设立的“运河使用国协会”合作，这一事实不能不引起深深的疑虑。目前有人想利用安全理事会的权威来批准某些政府的片面行动，而这种行动绝不是为了公正地解决苏伊士问题的。
    英法没有道理向安理会控告埃及
    谢皮洛夫指出英法两国完全没有道理向安全理事会控告埃及，并且说，劳埃德和比诺的发言以及他们提出的联合提案引起人们深刻怀疑。他们的发言没有包含任何积极性的纲领可以作为同埃及进行平等谈判的基础，反而引起了人们合理的忧虑。例如，法国外交部长说，在苏伊士问题上“采取妥协的措施是不合宜的”，“软弱要比强硬更为危险”，这种话不是隐藏的威胁是什么呢？英法提案所依据的不是同埃及进行平等谈判的原则，而实际上是再一次向埃及提出为埃及所不能同意的最后通牒式的条件和要求埃及投降。不用说，在这种基础上，我们将无法在苏伊士问题方面取得任何进展。人们有一种印象，就是英法提案不是打算使苏伊士运河问题获得积极的解决，而是追求联合国任务范围之外的目的。
    谢皮洛夫指出，英法政府是在指责实力政策舆论的压力下，才把问题提交安全理事会的。但是劳埃德和比诺的发言以及英法提案证明：英、法代表并不致力于设法在公正的基础上圆满解决苏伊士问题，并不致力于设法利用安全理事会来在这个使大家不安的问题上获得真正的进展。他们提出的提案不可能在安全理事会获得他们所期望的承认。
    谢皮洛夫说，提出这种提案意味着英法的统治集团对广大社会人士希望和平解决苏伊士问题的庄严要求显然打算作如下的回答：“你们要求我们提交联合国。我们就这样做了。我们提交安全理事会了。但是，你们可以看到，安全理事会是软弱无力的，它不能有所作为。同埃及协商的方法不会有任何结果，应当采取别的措施。罪过在埃及。把它千刀万剐！”
    有人就是在这样地准备舆论，以便谴责埃及，放手地进行下一步行动。但是这种处事的办法包藏着极其严重的危险。这是玩火的把戏。这种办法不会推动我们沿着解决苏伊士问题的道路前进。这种办法会严重损害联合国的威信，使和平和安全的利益受到威胁，并且将使英法对可能产生的局势负有严重的责任。
    希望英法两国领导人表现出诚意
    谢皮洛夫说，我们相信英国和法国的领导人是远见和明智的，我们相信他们最后将不想使苏伊士问题复杂化，他们会表现出诚意，使他们在苏伊士问题获得良好的解决方面作出建设性的贡献。我希望，劳埃德和比诺为了创造为有效的谈判和和平解决苏伊士问题所必要的气氛，将同意收回他们的提案，因为这个提案不可能导致任何好的结果。我还希望，我们，在这里举行圆桌会议的人，包括埃及代表在内，将一起努力利用共同的智慧找出使苏伊士问题获得和平的和公正的解决的最好办法。
