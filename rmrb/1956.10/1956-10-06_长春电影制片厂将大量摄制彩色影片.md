Xinhua News Agency report: The vice director of Changchun Film Studio said at the factory's 11th anniversary celebration on the 2nd that the Changchun Film Studio workers have completed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and will begin shooting color films next year. According to the plan, the factory's annual output will reach 30 feature films and 60 dubbed films in the future. More than 80% of the feature films will be color films, and there will be a certain number of widescreen films.

Since the production of the first feature film "Bridge" in 1949, the Changchun Film Studio has supplied 52 feature films to audiences across the country. Among these films, many films such as "The White Haired Girl", "Steel Warrior", and "Daughters of China" have won awards at various international film festivals. In addition to completing seven of the fourteen feature films planned for this year, the factory's workers are now busily shooting seven films, including "Eagles in the Storm," which reflects the story of the Red Army's Long March, and the Ping opera stage documentary "Liu Qiao'er."

The first dubbed film produced by the factory in 1949 was the Soviet film "Ordinary Soldier". To date, 307 films have been dubbed. Now, the factory can supply the audience with one foreign film dubbed in Chinese every week on average.

The predecessor of Changchun Film Studio was the puppet "Manchuria Film Corporation". After the Soviet army liberated Changchun in 1945, it returned to the hands of the people.
