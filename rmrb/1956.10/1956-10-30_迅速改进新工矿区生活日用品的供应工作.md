Quickly Improve the Supply of Daily Necessities in New Industrial and Mining Areas
Assistant Minister of Commerce, Dai Jinong

In the past few years, due to the country's vigorous development of industry, many new industrial and mining bases and new construction areas around existing cities have emerged across the country. Many of these bases are built in barren mountains, wilderness, and remote areas, generally sparsely populated, with a very weak original commercial foundation, or no commerce at all. To meet the daily needs of the new district residents, along with the development of the new district, state-owned commerce has developed to a certain extent, and the commodity supply work has also been improved. However, the population of the new district is increasing rapidly, and the proportion of workers, technicians, and experts is relatively large, with generally higher purchasing power, and they come from all over the country, with different living habits and needs, resulting in a serious situation where commodity supply work lags far behind actual requirements.

The main problems of commerce in the new industrial and mining areas are: (1) Insufficient quantity and variety of commodities, making life very inconvenient. Poor supply of goods has already affected the production morale and health of some employees. (2) Too few commercial institutions and personnel, resulting in low service quality. Due to the shortage of commercial personnel, there is a general phenomenon of customers queuing up and salespersons being exhausted all day long, while the supply of materials still cannot meet the needs. (3) Insufficient capital construction of state-owned commerce. Business premises are narrow, and warehouses and dormitories are very inadequate. In the Xiaowolong retail store in Taiyuan, goods are sold with umbrellas on rainy days. In many areas, goods are stored in the open air, causing a lot of losses. In the Qaidam Basin, the store's inventory is often buried in the sand and sometimes cannot be found. There is also an extreme shortage of housing for employees, making it even more difficult to accommodate family members, and in some areas, there is even a phenomenon of humans and animals living together. Insufficient capital construction directly limits the expansion of the commercial network and the increase of commercial personnel.

The main reason for this situation is that the development of commerce in the new industrial and mining areas and new construction areas around existing cities is far behind the needs of industrial capital construction development. This is because the national economic planning departments have invested too little in the commerce of the new industrial and mining areas, only considering the construction of factories and the installation of machines in these areas, and rarely considering that commerce must be developed correspondingly in these areas, and that industry and commerce must be arranged together as a whole. In addition, from the perspective of the commercial sector, past attention to the work in the new industrial and mining areas was delayed, and there are also shortcomings and errors.

Developing and constructing new industrial bases is a very important step in China's industrial development. The state continuously sends various construction personnel to these areas to build various undertakings, and at the same time, it must ensure the living needs of these people; otherwise, the construction undertakings will inevitably be greatly affected. Therefore, doing a good job in the supply of materials in the new industrial and mining areas is indeed a matter of great significance. So, how can we do this work well?

First, there must be unified planning and unified construction. In the new industrial and mining areas and new construction areas of old cities, commercial construction should be included in the planning along with industrial and cultural and educational capital construction. The first step in commercial construction is to increase commercial personnel. How many commercial personnel are needed in the new industrial and mining areas to basically meet the needs of the people in the new area? According to statistics from seventeen industrial cities such as Lanzhou, Taiyuan, and Xi'an, the number of employees in pure commerce and catering, excluding service industries, accounts for 3.5% of the total urban population. We chose these cities as the basis for calculation because the existing commercial personnel in these cities are already insufficient, and people already have to queue up to buy things, which can be used as the minimum quota for commercial personnel required in the new industrial and mining areas and new construction areas around old cities. According to the labor and wage plan (draft) compiled by the Labor and Wage Bureau of the State Planning Commission on August 25 this year, it is estimated that the total social population increased in the new industrial and mining areas and around old cities during the Second Five-Year Plan period is 7.5 million, which requires an increase of 260,000 commercial employees.

How to increase these personnel? We believe that this also needs to be arranged in a unified manner. In principle, the provinces and cities where the new industrial and mining areas are located should first transfer personnel from the original state-owned, supply and marketing cooperatives, and joint state-private stores in other areas of the province and city. Regions with conditions can also recruit a group of apprentices after approval by the local people's committee for training to make up for the shortfall. Provinces that really cannot solve the problem (such as Qinghai, Xinjiang, etc.) still hope that coastal cities with a commercial foundation can continue to transfer some state-owned and joint state-private commercial personnel to support them. We know that regions such as Qinghai and Xinjiang not only lack commercial personnel, but also have a relatively small agricultural population throughout the province and region. When expanding commercial institutions, it is impossible to not rely on the support of cities with a commercial foundation. Therefore, some cities with a commercial foundation should also pay attention to absorbing and training a large number of new apprentices to supplement local commercial personnel and provide long-term support to new areas.

Increasing commercial personnel must be accompanied by a corresponding increase in capital construction. According to the construction area required for each commercial employee stipulated by the State Construction Commission, including business premises, warehouses, offices, employee dormitories, pigsties, vegetable cellars, and refrigeration equipment, according to the minimum unit price stipulated by the state, each person needs a total of 2,100 yuan for capital construction (possibly higher in the Northwest region, and lower in some regions). If calculated according to the increase of 260,000 commercial personnel in the new construction area during the Second Five-Year Plan period, a total of 550 million yuan is needed for capital construction (excluding transportation tools and business equipment). Because in the new industrial and mining areas and the new construction areas around cities, commerce, like industry, is basically starting from scratch, with no original equipment available for utilization, if the state cannot allocate this minimum amount of investment, and cannot guarantee that commercial capital construction is included in the construction plan, then it is simply impossible to establish commercial institutions in these areas. Guaranteeing the supply to employees in the new district is ultimately just empty talk.

Therefore, we believe that while the state arranges industrial capital construction in the new construction areas, it is best to arrange commercial capital construction as well, with unified planning, unified allocation of funds, and unified construction, which should be specifically implemented by the provincial and municipal planning committees. This is the most effective and economical method for the country, and we hope that it can be implemented quickly. The state has allocated more capital construction funds to various regions this year than in previous years, and we also ask various regions to actively strive to complete this year's construction tasks. We must adhere to the principle of thrift and try to build as few high-rise buildings with decorated facades as possible. And adopt a positive attitude to seek support from all aspects in terms of construction forces and building materials. Only in this way can more houses be built to meet the urgent needs of business and employee life.

Second, vigorously improve the supply of goods. In terms of non-staple foods and handicrafts, the principle of basically solving them locally should be adopted. Daily non-staple foods such as vegetables and meat are not suitable for long-distance transportation. An effective solution should be to establish supply bases around the new industrial and mining areas. Not only should agricultural production cooperatives be mobilized to grow more vegetables and raise more pigs in the surrounding areas (preferably with supply and demand contracts directly signed by agricultural cooperatives and demanding units), but also industrial and mining enterprises and employee families should be encouraged to grow vegetables, raise pigs, and raise poultry on the vacant land beside factories and houses. Only a few new industrial and mining areas that temporarily do not have these conditions (such as the Qaidam Basin) should overcome various difficulties and solve the problem by transporting goods from afar, while other regions should actively provide support. As for general non-staple foods such as tofu, bean sprouts, and sauces, it is much more timely and effective to establish some small processing enterprises locally to produce and supply them than to transport them, and this should also be vigorously promoted. The handicrafts needed by ordinary families (such as furniture, cooking utensils, etc.) are basically solved by organizing production locally or adjusting the supply from other regions in the province. Only when the province really cannot solve the problem can it be adjusted from other provinces and cities. In short, only by fully utilizing all possible conditions for local production and supply can the supply of daily necessities in industrial and mining areas be gradually solved fundamentally.

In the operation of industrial products, it is necessary to increase the variety and quantity of supply to meet the growing needs of the residents of the new district. In order to increase the variety and quantity of goods, in addition to increasing institutions and cadres, and strengthening business operations, the head office and the commercial departments of various provinces and cities should give appropriate consideration to the new industrial and mining areas in the allocation of goods. At the same time, it is also necessary to make it clear to customers that some things are in short supply nationwide and cannot fully meet the needs. It is also necessary to actively develop the catering and service industries. In addition, due to the characteristics of residents in the new industrial and mining areas purchasing goods with concentrated and diverse needs, the commercial sector must flexibly establish a commercial network and formulate various supply systems and methods according to the requirements of the masses to facilitate customers' purchases.

Third, at present, winter is approaching, and the various remote new industrial and mining areas in the north (such as Karamay, Qaidam, Baiyin Factory, etc.) urgently need some winter supplies. The commercial sector should seize the time to prepare and solve the problem. In these areas, the transportation and storage of winter vegetables and meat should be organized now, and more dried vegetables, pickles, vermicelli, frozen meat, canned food, and other non-staple foods should be stored for adjustment and supply in winter. Cold-proof supplies needed by people in the new district, such as tents, cotton-padded clothing, heating appliances (such as stoves), and coal, must be quickly organized for processing, production, and transportation. Those that can be solved in the province should be solved in the province as much as possible; those that cannot be solved in the province must organize the source of goods from other places as soon as possible and seize the transportation to prevent being caught off guard temporarily. At present, some commodities or raw materials are somewhat tight in supply, and the old districts should give as much consideration as possible to the spirit of supporting the new districts. Commercial leaders at all levels must also strengthen the leadership and supervision of this work so that the residents of the various remote industrial and mining areas can spend the severe winter more conveniently.

Because the commercial foundation of the new industrial and mining areas is weak, and the supply of goods involves many aspects, the supply work cannot be completely done well by the commercial sector alone. It is hoped that the local party and government departments will strengthen leadership and assistance, and the trade union, industrial and mining, transportation, and other departments will also provide maximum assistance, especially in renting housing equipment and using transportation tools. We believe that with the concerted efforts of all departments, the commodity supply work in the current and future industrial and mining areas will surely be rapidly improved.

    迅速改进新工矿区生活日用品的供应工作
    商业部部长助理　戴冀农
    几年来，由于国家大力发展工业，全国各地陆续出现了很多新工矿基地和旧有城市周围的新建区。其中有不少基地是建立在荒山野地和边远地区的，一般人烟稀少，原有商业基础很薄弱，或者根本就没有商业。为了满足新区居民的生活需要，随着新区的发展，国营商业已有了一定的发展，商品供应工作也有了一些改进。但是，新区人口增加的速度很快，其中工人、技术人员和专家们所占比例较大，购买力一般较高，而且他们是来自各地，有不同的生活习惯和需要，以致形成商品供应工作远远落后于实际要求的严重情况。
    目前新工矿区商业的主要问题是：（1）商品供应数量不足，品种太少，人们生活很不方便。由于物品供应不好，已经影响了部分职工的生产情绪和身体健康。（2）商业机构和人员过少，服务质量低。因为商业人员少，就普遍出现了顾客排队拥挤、售货员终日劳累不堪而物资供应仍不能满足需要的现象。（3）国营商业基本建设不足。营业场所窄小，仓库、宿舍都很不够。太原市小卧龙零售店下雨天打着伞卖货。许多地区货物露天存放，造成很多损失。柴达木盆地商店的存货常被埋在风沙里，有时就找不到了。职工居住的房子也极缺，安放家属就更困难，有的地区还有人畜共居的现象。由于基本建设不足，也就直接限制了商业网的扩大和商业人员的增加。
    产生这种情况的主要原因，是新工矿区和旧有城市周围新建区商业的发展，远远落后于工业基本建设发展的需要，这是由于国家经济计划部门对新工矿区商业的投资太少，只考虑到在这些地区建设厂房和安装机器，而很少考虑到在这些地区必须相应地发展商业，必须把工业和商业放在一起来全盘安排。此外，从商业部门来说，过去对新工矿区的工作注意得晚，也是有缺点和错误的。
    开发和建设新的工业基地，是我国发展工业的一项极为重要的步骤，国家不断地增派各种建设人员到这些地区去兴建各种事业，同时，就必须保证这些人的生活需要，否则，建设事业就必然会受到很大的影响。因此，做好新工矿区的物资供应工作实在是一件具有重大意义的事情。那么，如何才能做好这个工作呢？
    第一，必须统一规划，统一建设。在新工矿区和旧有城市的新建区中，在进行工业和文教基本建设的同时，应当把商业建设也规划在内。进行商业建设首先就要增加商业人员。在新工矿区到底需要多少商业人员才能够基本上适应新区人民的需要呢？根据兰州、太原、西安等十七个工业城市的统计，纯商业和饮食业的从业人员，不包括服务业在内，占城市居民总数的3.5％。我们选择这些城市作为计算的依据，是因为这些城市现有的商业人员已经是不足的，人民购买东西已经有不少要排队，可以把它作为新工矿区和旧有城市周围新建区需要商业人员的最低定额。根据国家计划委员会劳动工资局在今年8月25日编制的劳动工资计划（草案）推算，在第二个五年计划期间内，全国新工矿区和旧有城市周围增加的社会人口共有七百五十万人，从而需要增加商业职工二十六万人。
    如何来增加这些人员呢？我们认为这也需要统一进行安排。在原则上，新工矿区所在的省、市应首先从本省、市的其他地区抽调原有的国营、供销合作社和公私合营商店的人员。有条件的地区在经过当地人民委员会批准之后，还可招收一批学徒，进行培养训练以补不足。本省实在无法解决者（如青海、新疆等地），还希望沿海有商业基础的城市能继续抽调一部分国营和公私合营的商业人员去支援他们。我们知道，像青海、新疆等地区，不仅商业人员不足，而且全省、区农业人口也是比较少的，在扩充商业机构的时候，完全不依靠有商业基础的城市的支援是不行的。所以，部分有商业基础的城市还应当注意吸收和培养大批新学徒，以便补充当地商业人员和长期支援新地区。
    增加商业人员就必须相应地增加基本建设。根据国家建设委员会所规定的每个商业人员需要的建筑面积计算，包括营业场所、仓库、办公室、职工宿舍、猪圈、菜窖和冷藏设备在内，按照国家规定的最低单价，每人共需基本建设款二千一百元（西北地区可能还得高些，有些地区可以低些）。如按第二个五年计划期间，在新建区增加商业人员二十六万人计算，则共需基本建设款五亿五千万元（运输工具和营业用具不在内）。由于在新工矿区和城市周围的新建区，商业和工业一样，基本上都是平地起家的，是没有什么原有设备可供利用的，如果国家不能拨给这个最低限度的投资数字，不能保证把商业基本建设列入施工计划，那末，就根本没有可能在这些地区设立商业机构。保证新区的职工供应，归根到底就是一句空话。
    所以，我们认为在国家安排新建区的工业基本建设的同时，最好也把商业基本建设安排在内，统一规划，统一拨款，统一施工，由省市计划委员会具体贯彻执行。这对国家说来，是一种最有效最节约的办法，希望能够很快的实行。国家今年对各地拨给的基本建设款比往年有所增加，还请各地积极争取完成今年的施工任务。我们必须坚持节约原则，尽可能少建装璜门面的高楼大厦。并采取积极态度，在施工力量和建筑材料方面求得各方面的支持。只有这样，才有可能更多地建成一些房屋，以供营业和职工生活的迫切需要。
    第二，大力改善商品的供应工作。在副食品和手工业品方面，应该采取基本上就地解决的原则。蔬菜和肉类等日用副食品是不适合长途运输的，有效的解决办法应该是在新工矿区的周围建立供应基地。在周围地区不只是要发动农业生产合作社多种菜、多养猪（最好由农业社和需要单位直接签订供需合同），而且要鼓励工矿企业和职工家属也在厂旁、宅旁隙地上种菜、养猪和饲养家禽。只有少数的暂时没有这些条件的新工矿区（如柴达木盆地）才应该克服各种困难从远地调运解决，而其他地区应该积极加以支援。至于豆腐、豆芽、酱醋等一般副食品，在当地建立一些小型加工企业进行生产供应，比较调运更及时更有效得多，也应该大力推行。一般家庭需要的手工业品（例如家具、炊事用具等），基本上依靠在当地组织生产或从本省其他地区调剂解决，只有在本省实在无法解决时，再从其他省市调剂。总之，只有充分发挥当地的生产和供应的一切可能条件，才能逐步从根本上解决工矿区的日常用品的供应问题。
    在工业品经营上必须增加供应的品种和数量，以满足新区居民日益增长的需要。为了增加商品品种和数量，除增加机构、干部，加强经营工作外，总公司和各省市商业厅局在货源的分配上应该对新工矿区加以适当照顾，但同时也必须向顾客讲清楚，有些东西是全国供不应求的，无法完全满足需要。还要积极发展饮食业和服务业。此外，由于在新工矿区居民购买商品具有需要集中、多种多样等特点，商业部门就必须根据群众的要求灵活的建立商业网和制定各种供应制度和方法，以便利顾客的购买。
    第三，目前，冬季即将来临，北方各个边远的新工矿区（如克拉玛依、柴达木、白银厂等地）迫切需要一些冬季用品，商业部门应该抓紧时间进行准备和解决。在这类地区，现在即应组织冬用蔬菜和肉类的调运和保管工作，并要多储一些干菜、酱菜、粉条、冻肉、罐头等副食品，以备冬季调剂供应。新区人们所需的防寒用品，例如帐篷、棉皮服装、取暖用具（如火炉）和煤炭等等，都要赶快组织加工生产和调运。在本省能够解决的应尽量在省内解决；在本省不能解决的，必须尽快到外地组织货源，并抓紧运输，以防临时措手不及。目前某些商品或原料在供应上是有些紧张的，旧区应该本着支援新区的精神尽量照顾，多给一些。各级商业领导部门也要加强领导和监督这个工作的进行，以便各边远工矿区的居民能够比较方便地度过严冬。
    由于新工矿区商业基础薄弱，商品供应工作牵涉的方面又很多，因而，只有商业部门单独努力还是不能完全做好供应工作的，希望当地党政部门要多多加强领导和协助，工会、工矿、交通等部门也要给予最大限度的帮助，特别是在租借房屋设备和使用运输工具等方面更要大力支援商业部门。我们相信在各部门协同工作之下，当前的和今后的工矿区的商品供应工作一定会有迅速改进。
