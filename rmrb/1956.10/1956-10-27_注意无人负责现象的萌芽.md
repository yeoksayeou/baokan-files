	Notice the Budding Phenomenon of No One Taking Responsibility
	By our reporter Ji Yin
	State-owned factories in Shanghai are now gradually changing the enterprise leadership system, abolishing the "one-chief system" that has been implemented for nearly two years and replacing it with a leadership system that combines collective leadership by the Party committee with division of labor and responsibility. This reform has clearly brought a new atmosphere to enterprise work. However, in some factories I visited, I found that there are also some problems, or deviations, in this regard that need to be corrected. It is estimated that these problems may also exist in other regions or enterprises.
	One situation is that the collective leadership and division of labor and responsibility system has in practice become a system of no one taking responsibility, causing enterprise work to be in a state of drift, and thus some new chaos has appeared in production.
	Some comrades in the factories misunderstood the abolition of the "one-chief system" to mean that all production responsibility systems established in the past when the "one-chief system" was implemented (whether good or bad) should be abolished; they misunderstood that emphasizing the mass line in enterprise work means that all disciplines and systems for maintaining production should be abolished. The deputy chief engineer of State Cotton Mill No. 17 told me that this kind of budding phenomenon already exists in their factory. Some workshop directors know that the "one-chief system" is no longer acceptable, so they dare not issue orders, dare not criticize, and there are also situations where orders are not executed below. The responsibility system is relaxed or abolished invisibly. For example, in the past, if quality accidents occurred in the sizing workshop, responsibility would be investigated according to the system to find out the cause. Facts have proved that this responsibility system is very effective in reducing quality accidents. Now this system has been abolished invisibly, and no one investigates accidents, so the number of quality accidents has increased compared to the past. He said that there were indeed too many kinds of production responsibility systems in the past, such as more than 30 kinds in the first workshop. Some systems did have the tendency of being too cumbersome and divorced from reality, but most of the systems were still necessary. Violating them would cause problems in production. For example, recently the weaving branch violated the system and changed the sizing concentration, which resulted in substandard cloth. This situation in the sizing workshop of State Cotton Mill No. 17 has also been found in other factories.
	The deputy chief engineer's opinion is correct. The above situation is a very dangerous misunderstanding of the new leadership system. If it is allowed to develop, it will cause enterprise work to fall back into the disaster of no one taking responsibility. This is mainly because some people do not understand that the collective leadership and division of labor and responsibility system means that, on the one hand, major principled and policy issues must be discussed collectively, but in the implementation, a clear division of labor must be implemented and a strict system and discipline must be established. Collective leadership and division of labor and responsibility are closely linked and inseparable. Therefore, the implementation of collective leadership not only cannot abolish the past effective production responsibility systems, but also must strengthen it, enrich it, and make it more perfect. Of course, some systems in the past did have shortcomings, or were formalistic, but the modification or abolition of these systems should also be carried out cautiously, gradually in conjunction with production, to avoid affecting production.
	The budding of the phenomenon of no one taking responsibility is often linked to the following situation, that is, after the abolition of the "one-chief system", some administrative heads have caused ideological fluctuations, they worry that the abolition of the "one-chief system" will restrict their administrative power, "their voices are no longer loud", and the promotion of administrative work will encounter difficulties. One factory director was emotionally depressed and sighed to me: "It will be difficult to be a factory director in the future." Some factory directors have become timid in handling administrative work and are afraid to take responsibility. One factory director of a Jinbi factory now takes all matters, no matter how big or small, to the Party general branch committee for discussion and instructions. Of course, this will not make the work highly efficient.
	Will it really be difficult to be a factory director in the future? Of course not. The abolition of the "one-chief system" only corrects the past mistake of placing the power of administrative leaders above the Party organization. Correcting this mistake does not mean weakening the administrative power of the factory director, but only means that enterprise administrative work has a better mass base, and means a better combination of individual wisdom and collective wisdom. How can we draw the conclusion that "it will be difficult to be a factory director in the future"? The correct conclusion should be: in the future, factory directors will definitely be much easier to be than in the past, and the work will definitely be more effective than in the past. Comrades from State-owned Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant told me an example: In the past, the second workshop of this factory had very serious work-related injuries, and the completion of production tasks was often threatened. The workshop director did not believe in the masses and was unwilling to do things according to the methods suggested by the masses. He moved all the "safety bulletins" to the office, locked himself in the room to read them, and still could not find a way. Recently, after the factory changed the leadership system, the Party general branch mobilized all Party members to discuss it, and the masses put forward many methods. Under the administrative leadership, some defects in the equipment were improved, workers taught each other and learned from each other, and the bad situation of frequent accidents was reversed in a short period of time. After the education of this incident, the workshop director said to everyone: "The method of collective leadership is really good."
	Many facts show that to correctly implement collective leadership, members of the Party committee, especially the Party secretary, have an important responsibility.
	The following situation is also an important reason for the formation of no one taking responsibility, that is, some Party committees stipulate that the content that should be submitted for discussion is too trivial. Expenses of several tens of yuan and the promotion of a worker must be discussed. If it is found that the administration has not submitted some unimportant issues for discussion, they will be criticized. They also do not support administrative leaders in making independent decisions on some urgent issues that require immediate decisions. Some Party secretaries directly interfere in major and minor administrative affairs. A comrade from a cotton textile factory said: "Our factory has now changed from a 'one-chief system' to a 'secretary system'." In this way, the enthusiasm of administrative leaders is suppressed, and the Party committee is back on the old path of "not doing its job", swimming in the sea of ​​affairs all day long, and has no time to do the Party's political and ideological work.
	I also found that many enterprises have not done enough ideological work in changing the leadership system. It can be said that there is no movement at all. Most factories have not conducted free and sincere discussions on this issue in the Party committee and among the cadres. As a result, various confused thoughts are freely rampant among the people. In fact, changing the enterprise leadership system is not an easy task. There are quite a few ideological problems among the cadres, and the influence left by the "one-chief system" is quite deep. There are still many specific problems that need to be studied and resolved (such as how to implement collective leadership at the workshop branch level, the formulation of the Party committee collective leadership system, etc.). It is by no means that the leader can solve it all by making a report and issuing an order.
	The leading cadres of some factories almost all have such a cry: they hope that the higher-level leading organs will pay more attention and help on this important issue that affects the entire work of the enterprise. The current favorable condition is that the Eighth National Congress of the Party has pointed out a clear direction for the issue of the enterprise leadership system and the mass line of enterprise management, and has provided many documents for learning and reference. We should make good use of these ideological weapons, quickly eliminate some abnormal phenomena that have already sprouted, and establish a new leadership system soundly.

    注意无人负责现象的萌芽
    本报记者　季音
    上海市的国营工厂，现在正在逐步地改变企业的领导制度，取消过去已实行了近两年的一长制，代之以党委集体领导与分工负责相结合的领导制度。这个改革，已经明显地给企业工作带来了新的气象。但是我在访问的一些工厂中，发现这方面也存在着一些问题，或者说是偏差，需要纠正。估计这些问题在其他地区或企业中也可能会有的。
    一种情形就是把集体领导、分工负责制在实际上变成了无人负责制，使企业工作处于自流状态，因而生产上出现了一些新的紊乱。
    有些工厂的同志把取消一长制，误解成为过去在实行一长制时建立的一切生产责任制度（不论好的或坏的）都要取消；误解成为强调企业工作的群众路线，就要取消一切维护生产的纪律和制度。国棉十七厂的副总工程师告诉我：他们厂里就已经有这种萌芽，有的车间主任知道一长制不行了，就不敢下命令，不敢批评，下边也有了不执行命令的情况，责任制度松懈或无形取消。譬如浆纱车间过去发生质量事故，都要按制度追查责任，找出原因。事实证明这种责任制度对减少质量事故是很有效的。现在这个制度已无形中取消了，发生事故没人追查，结果质量事故就比过去增多。他说：过去各种生产责任制度是多了一些，像第一车间就有三十多种，有些制度确有要求过于繁琐和脱离实际的偏向，但大部分制度还是必要的，违反它生产就会出问题，如最近织布分场违反制度，改变了上浆浓度，结果就出了次布。像国棉十七厂浆纱车间的这种情形，在别的厂里也有发现。
    这位副总工程师的意见是正确的。上述这种情形是一种对新的领导制度很危险的误解，如果任其发展下去，就会使企业工作重陷于无人负责的灾难之中。这主要是有些人不懂得，集体领导分工负责制是：一方面有关重大的原则性和政策性问题要实行集体讨论，但在执行中必须实行明确的分工，建立严明的制度和纪律。集体领导与分工负责两者是紧密结合不可分离的，因此实行集体领导不但不能取消过去那些行之有效的生产责任制度，而且还要加强它，充实它，使之更加完善。当然，过去也有些制度的确是有缺点的，或者是形式主义的，但修改或取消这些制度，也要谨慎从事，结合着生产逐步地来做，避免生产受到影响。
    无人负责现象的萌芽和下边这种情形常常是联系着的，这就是：取消一长制后，有些行政负责人中间引起了思想上的波动，他们担心取消一长制以后会限制了他们的行政权力，“说话不响亮了”，使行政工作的推行遇到困难。有一位厂长情绪消沉，唉声叹气地对我说：“以后厂长难做了”。有些厂长在处理行政工作时变得缩手缩脚，害怕负责。有一位金笔厂厂长，现在不论大小事情，都拿到党总支委员会去讨论，请示。当然，这样做是不能使工作具有很高效率的。
    以后厂长真的难做了吗？当然不是。取消一长制只不过是纠正了过去那种把行政领导人的权力凌驾于党组织之上的错误，纠正这种错误，绝不意味着厂长行政权力的削弱，而只是意味着企业行政工作有了更好的群众基础，意味着个人智慧与集体智慧的更好结合，怎么能得出“以后厂长难做了”的结论呢？正确的结论应当是：今后厂长一定会比过去好做得多，工作一定比过去更有成效。国营上海第二钢厂的同志告诉我一个例子：这个厂的第二车间，过去工伤事故一直很严重，生产任务的完成时常受到威胁。车间主任不相信群众，不肯按照群众建议的办法去做，一个人把所有的“安全通报”都搬到办公室里，关起门来读，还是找不出一条办法。最近，这个厂改变了领导制度以后，党总支发动全体党员来讨论，群众提出了许多办法，在行政领导下，改进了设备上的一些缺陷，工人们互教互学，掌握操作方法，短期内把事故频繁的恶劣局面扭转了。经过这次事情的教育，车间主任逢人便说：“真是集体领导的办法好。”
    许多事实说明，正确地实行集体领导，党委会的成员，特别是党委书记负有重要的责任。
    下列这种情形也是形成无人负责的一个重要原因，即有些党委会对于应该提交讨论的内容规定得过于琐细，几十元钱的开支，一个工人的升级，都要讨论。发现行政上没把某些不甚重要的问题提交讨论，就予以批评。对有些时间紧迫、需要当机立断的问题，也不支持行政领导人去作独立的处理。有些党委书记直接地干预大小行政事务。一位棉纺织厂的同志说：“我们厂现在是由一长制变成书记制了。”这样，行政领导人的积极性受到了压抑，党委会则又走上了“不务正业”的旧路，整日泅游在事务主义的大海中，无暇再去做党的政治思想工作。
    我还发现许多企业在改变领导制度方面的思想工作，都做得非常不够，简直可以说毫无动静，大多数厂没有在党委会和干部中就这个问题展开自由、诚恳的讨论，于是各种混乱思想在人们中间自由地泛滥着，事实上，改变企业领导制度并不是一件轻而易举的事，干部中间的思想问题相当多，一长制留下的影响也相当深，也还有不少具体问题需要研究解决（例如车间支部一级如何实行集体领导，党委集体领导制度的制定等），绝不是由领导人作一个报告、发一道命令就可以全部解决的。
    一些厂的领导干部几乎都有这样的呼声：希望上级领导机关在这个关系着企业整个工作的重要问题上，给予更多的注意和帮助。现在的有利条件是：党的第八次全国代表大会上已经给企业领导制度问题和企业管理群众路线问题指出了明确的方向，并且提供了许多可供学习和参考的文件。我们应当很好地利用这些思想武器，迅速地消除目前已经萌芽的一些不正常现象，把新的领导制度健全地建立起来。
