Xinhua News Agency, 25th. The Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China held a慰问 evening party in Beijing tonight to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. More than 1,500 officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing, officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Beijing, and their families attended the party.

Marshal Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, and Senior Generals Zhang Zongxun, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Gan Siqi, Deputy Director of the General Political Department, and Chen Shiju, Commander of the Engineering Corps, attended the evening party.

The memorial ceremony began with the band playing the national anthems of China and North Korea. Jin Guinan, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Korean Embassy in China, delivered a speech, emphasizing the significant contributions made by the Volunteers in the war against aggression and in supporting the post-war construction of the Korean people. He said at the end of his speech: The Korean people are determined to further strengthen the fighting friendship forged in blood between the people of China and North Korea, further consolidate the unity with the people of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and bravely advance to realize the unification of Korea and defend peace in Asia and the world.

General Gan Siqi, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, then spoke, saying: With the joint efforts of the people and armies of China and North Korea, we finally achieved the great victory of realizing the Korean armistice. However, now the U.S. imperialism and the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique are still unwilling to accept the lessons of the tragic defeat. We must maintain a high degree of vigilance, further strengthen the unity of the peace and democracy camp, and defend the peaceful life of the people of China and North Korea and world peace.

Geng Xiangbai, a representative of the families of the Volunteers, also spoke. She said: We hope to have a long-term reunion with our loved ones in Korea, but now U.S. imperialism and Syngman Rhee prevent us from reuniting with them immediately. She expressed her determination to work hard, raise her children well, and contribute to supporting the Korean people.

After the memorial ceremony, the National Folk Art Theater of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea performed the famous Korean classical play "Chunhyangjeon," which was warmly welcomed by the audience. During the intermission, Marshal Peng Dehuai met with the head of the troupe, Yin Douxian, and other leaders, and had a cordial conversation with them.
