Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 17th: Since the beginning of this year, criminal cases in Shanghai have decreased significantly.

According to statistics from January to September this year, the average number of criminal cases accepted by courts at all levels in Shanghai decreased by 68% compared to last year. Among them, the number of cases accepted for sabotaging economic construction decreased by 83%, and the number of cases accepted for theft and fraud decreased by more than 80%. The person in charge of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Justice pointed out that the rapid decline in crime is a gratifying phenomenon in Shanghai's social security that has never occurred before.

Since the arrival of the high tide of socialist transformation in Shanghai at the beginning of this year, all capitalist industry and commerce have been incorporated into the orbit of state capitalism, tens of thousands of unemployed people have found jobs, and many criminals have found a new path in life under lenient treatment. Therefore, the number of criminal offenses has been greatly reduced. From April to September, the average monthly number of criminal offenders confirmed by court judgments was 79% lower than the average monthly number over the past six years.

    社会主义改造后的新气象
    上海市犯罪现象大大减少
    新华社上海17日电　今年以来，上海市的刑事案件有了显著的减少。
    据今年1月到9月的统计，上海市各级法院每月刑事收案平均数比去年减少了68％，其中，破坏经济建设的收案数减少了83％，盗窃、诈骗的收案数减少了80％以上。上海市司法局负责人指出，犯罪现象的迅速下降，是上海社会治安中从来没有过的可喜现象。
    上海市在今年初社会主义改造高潮到来以后，资本主义工商业全部纳入了国家资本主义轨道，成千上万的失业者得到了职业，许多犯罪者在宽大处理下找到了重新生活的道路。因此，刑事犯罪人数大大减少，从4月到9月的六个月中，由法院判决确立的刑事罪犯的每月平均人数，比过去六年多以来的每月平均人数减少了79％。
