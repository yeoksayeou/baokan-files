    Leading Party and Government Cadres of Jiangsu Province and Huaiyin Prefecture
    Deeply Enter Disaster Areas to Lead Production for Self-Salvation

    (Our dispatch) Party and government leading cadres of Jiangsu Province and Huaiyin Prefecture personally went to the severely affected areas of Huaiyin to understand the suffering of the masses and actively lead the disaster-stricken masses in production for self-salvation.

    Huaiyin Prefecture has been a severely affected area in Jiangsu Province for many years. This year, the three seasons of crops have suffered continuous and severe disasters. According to old farmers, this is the biggest disaster in the area in fifty years.

    In July of this year, the Third Congress of the Communist Party of China in Jiangsu Province passed a resolution to face up to backward areas and care about the suffering of the masses. The province and prefecture immediately sent responsible cadres to the severely affected areas of Lianshui, Suqian, Huaiyin, and Huaian counties to conduct investigations. Through small meetings and visiting relatives and friends, the working group discovered many problems in the work of the disaster areas: in the face of severe disasters, many grassroots leading cadres did not care about the suffering of the masses; in distribution, there was a tendency of egalitarianism in pre-borrowing work points and distributing grain according to population; excessive public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, public grain, and loans were withheld; the relief funds and other loans and advance purchase deposits lent by the government were also largely accumulated in agricultural cooperatives or township offices; commune members generally lacked grain, oil, salt, forage, and pocket money, and their lives were very difficult.

    After discovering the above problems, the cadres of the working group immediately helped the local party committees and branches to solve them. With the help of comrades sent by the provincial and prefectural committees, the Lianshui County Party Committee promptly cleared out 3.78 million catties of grain and some cash that were inappropriately withheld by the agricultural cooperatives. After these grains and funds were distributed to the commune members in a timely manner, the production enthusiasm of the masses was greatly improved. In mid-August, the labor attendance rate in the Huideng District of Lianshui County increased from 72% to 92%.

    From late August to early September, the provincial party committee again sent Comrade Chen Shutong, member of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and Vice Governor of Jiangsu Province, and Comrade Huang Yigan, member of the Provincial Party Committee and Deputy Minister of the Rural Work Department, to the area to help with the work. Under the guidance of the Provincial Party Committee, the Huaiyin Prefectural Party Committee held a meeting of county party committee secretaries from September 6th to 11th to specifically study the current disaster situation in Huaiyin Prefecture and put forward five measures for production and disaster relief, leading the masses to overcome the disaster.

    江苏省和淮阴专区党政负责干部
    深入重灾区领导生产自救
    本报讯　江苏省和淮阴专区党政负责干部亲自深入淮阴地区重灾区了解群众疾苦，积极领导灾区群众进行生产自救。
    淮阴专区是江苏省历年来的重灾区。今年三季农作物连续遭受严重灾害。据老农说，这是当地五十年没有的大灾害。
    今年7月，中共江苏省第三次代表大会上作出决议，要正视落后地区，关心群众疾苦。省和专区即派遣负责干部深入涟水、宿迁、淮阴、淮安等县的重灾区进行调查。工作组通过小型会议和探亲访友，发现了灾区工作中存在许多问题：在灾情严重的情况下，许多基层领导干部不关心群众的疾苦；在分配中采取了预借工分和按人口分粮的平均主义倾向；扣留了过多的公积金、公益金和公粮、贷款；政府贷放的救济款和其他贷款及预购定金等，也大批积压在农业社或乡公所里；社员普遍缺粮、缺油、缺盐、缺草、缺零用钱，生活十分困难。
    工作组的干部发现以上问题后，当即帮助当地党委和支部进行解决。涟水县委在省、地委派来的同志帮助下，及时清理出农业社不适当扣留下来的三百七十八万斤粮食和一部分现金。把这些粮款及时分配给社员以后，大大提高了群众的生产积极性，涟水县灰灯区8月中旬劳动出勤率即由72％提高到92％。
      8月下旬和9月上旬，省委又派出省委委员、江苏省副省长陈书同，省委委员、农村工作部副部长黄以干等同志前往该区帮助工作。淮阴地委在省委的指导下，于9月6日到11日召开了县委书记会议，具体研究了淮阴专区当前的灾情，提出了生产救灾工作的五项措施，领导群众战胜灾荒。
