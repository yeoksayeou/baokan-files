    Fertilizer Plant on the Banks of the Songhua River
    The Jilin Fertilizer Plant, which began construction in April of last year, is a large-scale, mechanized chemical fertilizer plant. The nitrogen fertilizer that this plant will produce will be made from the inferior coal, river water, and air near the factory as raw materials. The entire project is expected to be completed in the third quarter of next year.

    去年4月动工兴建的吉林肥料厂是一座规模很大的机械化的化学肥料厂。这个厂将要生产的氮肥，是用工厂附近的劣质煤、江水和空气作原料制造的。全部工程预计在明年第三季度竣工。
