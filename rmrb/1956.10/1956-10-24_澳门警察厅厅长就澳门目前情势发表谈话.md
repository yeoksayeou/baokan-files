Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 23rd: Macau dispatch: The Chief of the Police Department of the Portuguese authorities in Macau, Mr. José Silvestre, made a public statement on the current situation in Macau on the 22nd of this month. His statement is as follows:

    Since the riots in Kowloon, many residents have been concerned about the public order and security situation in Macau. In fact, these concerns are absolutely unnecessary. As everyone knows, Macau is a small place, and the security authorities have a full grasp of the activities in every corner. We have made full preparations and have sufficient strength to deal with any disturbances. Since the Kowloon incident, the Macau security authorities have strengthened their precautions and taken necessary and strict measures. In addition to the police force itself, there is also the assistance of the military to deal with any disturbances with strict measures. For the sake of order and security in Macau, and for the sake of the residents' peaceful and happy lives, the police department is determined to carry out this task. At the same time, I request that all Macau residents actively cooperate with the police. If you encounter any suspicious persons or see any signs of unrest, you should immediately report to the police so that the police can put it down in time. In the event of a disturbance, residents should stay at home and avoid going out, so as not to increase the difficulty of the police in suppressing it. All residents should remain calm and carry on with their work, and avoid alarming each other. With everyone strengthening their vigilance, the villains will surely have no opportunity to use their skills.

    澳门警察厅厅长就澳门目前情势发表谈话
    新华社广州23日电　澳门消息：澳门葡萄牙当局警察厅厅长施若瑟在本月22日就澳门目前情势发表公开谈话。他的谈话如下：
    自从九龙发生骚动事件以来，很多居民都疑惑到本澳治安秩序问题。但事实上这些疑惑是绝对不必要的，大家都知道，澳门是弹丸之地，治安当局已经充分掌握到每个角落的活动情况，有了充分的戒备，充足的力量来应付任何的骚动，本澳治安当局自从九龙事件发生以来，已经加强了戒备，采取必要和严峻的措施，除了警察厅本身力量以外，还有军队的协助，以严厉的措施来应付任何骚动，为了本澳的秩序和治安，为了居民的安居乐业，警厅以最大的决心来执行这一任务。同时，我请求全澳居民应该与警方积极合作，遇到了什么可疑的人物，或有动乱的象征，应该马上报警，以便警方及时扑灭。万一动乱发生，居民更应居家，切勿外出，以免增加警方弹压困难。所有居民应该镇静，各安所业，切勿自相惊扰，在大家加强戒备下，歹徒必然无所施其技的。
