Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 26th. Bonn dispatch: The West German government held a cabinet meeting on October 24, presided over by Chancellor Adenauer, to discuss the Soviet government's note to the West German government on October 22. A West German government spokesman emphasized the "positive elements" of the Soviet note at a press conference held after the meeting.

The spokesman referred to the Soviet note's expression of interest in further exchange of views with the West German Federal Government and said that the West German government believes that continuing this exchange of views is "beneficial and important."

The spokesman also announced that after the new Soviet Ambassador to West Germany, Smirnov, arrives in West Germany, the West German government will begin to discuss the issue of trade relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany.

Xinhua News Agency, 26th. TASS, Bonn dispatch: German Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer, in a radio address on West German radio on October 25, once again spoke about the Soviet government's recent note to the West German government.

Ollenhauer said that it is clear from the Soviet note that Adenauer's "position of strength" rhetoric has completely failed. Whoever continues to pursue this policy now is endangering the cause of the German people.

Ollenhauer also said that the current task of the German people is to put forward new proposals to the Soviet Union. He advocated that a unified Germany should not be linked to the Warsaw Treaty or the Paris Treaty. He said that the proposal to establish a European collective security system should be seriously supported, and the guarantees and security that Germany can obtain from the collective security system will be more than the North Atlantic Treaty Organization could provide at any time in the past.

However, Ollenhauer also said that the Social Democratic Party still refuses to negotiate with the government of the German Democratic Republic. He also said that the Social Democratic Party does not recognize the Oder-Neisse line as the eastern border of Germany.

    西德政府讨论了苏联的照会
    认为两国进一步交换意见是有益的事
    奥伦豪尔反对阿登纳继续执行实力政策
    据新华社柏林26日电　波恩消息：西德政府10月24日在总理阿登纳的主持下举行了内阁会议，讨论了苏联政府在10月22日给西德政府的照会。西德政府发言人在会后举行的记者招待会上强调了苏联照会的“积极因素”。
    这个发言人提到了苏联照会对于同西德联邦政府作进一步的意见交换所表示的兴趣，并且说，西德政府认为继续进行这种意见交换是
  “有益的和重要的”。
    这个发言人还宣布，在苏联新任驻西德大使斯米尔诺夫到达西德以后，西德政府将要着手讨论苏联和西德之间的贸易关系问题。
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社波恩讯：德国社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔10月25日在西德电台发表广播演说，再一次谈到苏联政府最近给西德政府的照会。
    奥伦豪尔说，从苏联照会中可以明显地看出，阿登纳的“从实力地位出发”的论调已经完全地失败了。谁现在还要继续执行这种政策，谁就是危害德国人民的事业。
    奥伦豪尔还说，德国人目前的任务是向苏联提出新的建议。他主张统一的德国不同华沙条约或是巴黎条约发生联系。他说，应当认真支持关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议，德国从集体安全体系中能够得到的保障和安全将比北大西洋公约组织在过去任何时候所能提供的要多。
    但是，奥伦豪尔又说，社会民主党仍然拒绝同德意志民主共和国政府进行谈判。他还说，社会民主党不承认奥得—尼斯分界线是德国东部的国界。
