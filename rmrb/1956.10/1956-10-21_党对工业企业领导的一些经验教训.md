Some Lessons on the Party's Leadership of Industrial Enterprises
Huang Oudong, First Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee

General Situation

The task of the Eighth National Congress of the Party is to consolidate the unity of the whole Party, unite the people of the whole country, unite all forces that can be united, and give full play to all positive factors to build our country into a great socialist country. The Liaoning area is one of China's socialist industrial construction bases. After the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan began in 1953, not only were the original enterprises in the Liaoning area continuously renovated and expanded, but also large-scale new construction projects were carried out. There are a total of seventy-four industrial construction units above the limit, of which twenty-four are key projects belonging to the one hundred and fifty-six items. According to statistics at the beginning of the year, there are 1,834 large and small industrial and mining enterprises in the province, with a total of more than 830,000 employees. Modern industry accounts for 69.1% of the total industrial and agricultural output value of the province. In the future, in order to give full play to the role of this base, the task of the Liaoning Provincial Party Organization is very arduous. In the past few years, thanks to the correct leadership of the Central Committee, the active efforts of the broad masses of workers, and the sincere assistance of the great Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the industrial construction of the Liaoning area has achieved significant results. Industrial output value, labor productivity, and output of major products have all exceeded the national plan year by year. For example, among the enterprises under the various industrial ministries of the Central Government, seventy-five enterprises had reached the 1957 production level ahead of schedule by the end of August, and most of the state-owned industrial enterprises will also reach the 1957 level one year or one and a half years ahead of schedule. However, due to the insufficient efforts of party organizations at all levels in Liaoning Province, especially the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee itself, and the failure to focus on the central task of industrial construction, there are many shortcomings in industrial enterprises in fully implementing the Party's policies and completing the national plan, in technological transformation and the cultivation of technical forces, and in product quality. However, I believe that the most serious problem currently existing in industrial enterprises is the tendency to weaken the Party's leadership in industrial enterprises, and the insufficient implementation of the "relying on the working class is the fundamental line of the Party's work in cities" as clearly stipulated in the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, as well as the mass line consistently emphasized by the Party Central Committee. This is a fundamental issue related to promoting the enthusiasm of employees and ensuring socialist construction. Therefore, I would like to put forward some opinions on this issue based on the experience and lessons learned over the past few years.

The leadership system of combining collective leadership with individual responsibility stipulated by the Party Central Committee to strengthen the Party's leadership over industrial enterprises is completely correct. The Party is the highest form of organization of the working class, and the source of the Party's strength comes from the masses. Only by relying on the collective leadership of the Party and the wisdom of the masses can we guarantee the success of all work. Managing enterprises is no exception. This is a truth proven in our practical work over the years.

In the past, the errors of reducing the leadership role of the Party and excessively emphasizing the power of administrative leadership that existed for a long time in industrial enterprises in the Liaoning area were to oppose the Party's collective leadership and individual division of responsibility in enterprises, to oppose the administrative factory director responsibility system and the Party's mass line, and to oppose political work and economic work. As a result, commandism, punishmentism, and other tendencies to break away from the masses have developed in many enterprises. Many enterprises only want top-down administrative management, not bottom-up mass supervision; they neglect the leadership of socialist emulation and advanced producer movements, and fail to earnestly mobilize and adopt rationalization proposals from employees; employee congresses, employee representative meetings, production meetings, etc., are not held for a long time or become mere formalities; under the argument of "no democracy in technology," the practice of democratic management in enterprises is rejected; some enterprises have also promoted the "operation meeting" system, in which only administrative leaders issue orders and completely deprive others of the right to speak; some enterprises have implemented various methods of punishing workers, arbitrarily dismissing workers, deducting wages, and even insulting their personality. This has seriously damaged the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, making it impossible to give full play to the production potential of enterprises, and making it impossible to overcome the shortcomings and errors in enterprise management in a timely manner. Such enterprises cannot complete the national production and construction plan well.

On the other hand, the more advanced enterprise units that have achieved excellent production results are in a completely different situation. Because they have inherited and adhered to the tradition of the Party's collective leadership, used the wisdom of the masses to complete production tasks, frequently carried out mass criticism and supervision, organized the masses to participate in enterprise management, and stimulated their labor enthusiasm. Therefore, the democratic life inside and outside the Party there is very normal and full of vitality. The connection between enterprise leaders and the masses is relatively close, the level of awareness and production enthusiasm of the masses there is relatively high, and they can also complete production tasks well.

These experiences and lessons fully show that resolutely implementing the leadership system of combining the Party's collective leadership with individual responsibility in enterprises and thoroughly correcting past mistakes is the fundamental issue in strengthening the Party's leadership over enterprises.

Strengthening the Party's Political and Ideological Work in Enterprises

Strengthening the Party's leadership and relying on the working class to run enterprises well, this fundamental line of the Party's leadership of industrial enterprises requires us to first strengthen the Party's political work. Therefore, we must vigorously overcome the harmful tendency to underestimate political and ideological work. This is actually a reflection of underestimating the role of the Party. Political work is the lifeline of all economic work, and the Party's political and ideological work must be deeply integrated into the economic activities and technical fields of enterprises to reflect the Party's leadership over economic work. At present, some Party cadres in enterprises do not pay attention to guiding the Party's leadership to the increasingly developing economic issues, which is actually implementing the separation of political work and economic work. This tendency must be corrected. Secondly, experience has proved that we must also mobilize grassroots organizations not only to deepen political work into production, but also to deepen it into the lives of employees. In the past, the Party's political work in enterprises had great one-sidedness, that is, only paying attention to ideological work in production technology, but not paying attention to doing a good job in ideological work in the lives of employees; only paying attention to the ideological performance of employees in production, but not paying attention to the ideological dynamics of employees in life; only paying attention to carrying out political and ideological work among employees during factory and mine working hours, especially in spare time activities, but rarely going deep into workers' production and lives to carry out political and ideological work, especially neglecting ideological leadership of employees in activities outside the factory and in society. Therefore, we believe that the comprehensive development of the Party's work must be to make political and ideological work not only carried out in production technology, but also deepened into the lives of employees. Party organizations should not only solve the problems of employees' production and technical activities, but also solve their ideological problems in life. The Party's political and ideological work should not only be carried out inside factories and mines, but also extended to employees' residences. Integrate production, life, and education closely, and integrate factories with society and individuals with families closely. Only in this way can the Party's political work be deep and consolidated.

In addition, according to the current situation of the Party's grassroots organizations in enterprises, strengthening the Party's political and ideological work must also advocate the method of treating them differently. Because the essence of the Party organization's work is work on people, and people's potential is the greatest potential in the enterprise. In many of our enterprises, Party organizations give more general appeals to Party members and the masses, and less specific differentiated treatment. Therefore, in order to implement the Party's mass line and do a good job in mass work, we must emphasize supporting and cultivating advanced things, improving the intermediate, and transforming the backward. Supporting the advanced and transforming the backward are two aspects of the same thing. In the past, the biggest problem with the political work of our enterprises was that it could not work according to the backward and intermediate states. Treating the advanced, intermediate, and backward equally, and not being good at launching them separately. Therefore, we must learn to use the advanced to drive the backward and improve the intermediate. This is the most important issue of the Party's mass line. Last year, in order to respond to the call of the National Party Congress on "mobilizing the whole Party, being conscientious and conscientious, overcoming difficulties, striving to increase production, and practicing strict economy," we carried out extensive ideological education work and launched a comprehensive campaign to increase production and practice economy; this year, the industrial upsurge sparked by the ideological foundation of responding to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao against right-leaning conservative ideas, requiring more, faster, better, and more economical results, and accelerating socialist construction fully proves the role of the Party's ideological work. Experience has proved that the deeper the ideological work, the fuller and healthier the development of the movement. If the leadership of the movement is relaxed, and the ideological work in the movement is relaxed, the mass movement may also have some deviations. This year, there was such a situation in the industrial upsurge in Liaoning Province. Because we were satisfied with general appeals and formal grand occasions, and did not deeply understand the development of the movement and summarize the experience of the movement, we did not promptly discover the situation that the industrial upsurge was out of touch with the comprehensive completion of the national plan, and carried out timely ideological education and specific assistance, so that some enterprises did not comprehensively complete the national plan even in the upsurge, and there were even cases of declining quality and increased accidents. Some people did not see the positive aspects of the movement, but only saw these deviations, but did not study the reasons for the deviations, so there were some doubts and arguments that negated the mass movement, such as saying that "the movement can only destroy, not build," and thinking that the opinions of the masses are fragmented and undesirable, etc., which is obviously wrong. Its essence is the viewpoint of canceling the mass movement, and it is a specific manifestation of the lack of a viewpoint of relying on the masses.

In order to strengthen political and ideological work in enterprises, we emphasize that Party organizations should free themselves from routine affairs and overcome the tendency of the Party not managing the Party. Party organizations in enterprises should focus on studying and discussing major issues in production and administrative work, and mainly study key issues in completing the national plan and improving enterprise management from the perspective of policies and ideology. Thus, on the one hand, the enthusiasm and initiative of administrative leaders can be brought into play, and on the other hand, Party organizations can concentrate their efforts on doing a good job in the Party's various political and ideological work. It is emphasized that all Party work cadres in enterprises should go deep into production, go deep into the masses, earnestly study the Party's policies, and learn economic and business knowledge, and quickly eliminate ignorance in this regard. Combine political work and economic work closely, more effectively strengthen political and ideological leadership, give play to the role of political and ideological work, and constantly improve the ideological awareness of the masses of employees.

Relying on the Working Masses and Caring About the Lives of the Masses of Employees

To rely on the working masses and improve the awareness of the masses of employees, we must, while strengthening ideological education work, also greatly care about the lives of the masses of employees. In the past few years, although we have generally paid attention to improving the lives of employees on the basis of developing production, there have been deviations in one-sidedly emphasizing that individual interests should be subordinate to national interests and immediate interests should be subordinate to long-term interests, and actually neglecting the hardships in the lives of employees. For example, the phenomenon of employees suffering from occupational diseases and chronic diseases in some enterprises is serious, but there are large savings in medical expenses; the living difficulties of employees cannot be solved, but living relief funds are often accumulated; before the implementation of wage reform, the wages of employees in some enterprises were too low and were not adjusted in a timely manner, and some employees who should have been promoted were not promoted in a timely manner, but it was precisely in these enterprises that the total wage fund could not be completed according to plan. These phenomena seriously affected the production enthusiasm of the working masses and the connection between the Party and the masses. Because the Central Committee and the State Council promptly discovered this situation, they have taken a series of measures to correct this bias. According to the instructions of the Central Committee and the State Council, we have done some investigation and research work, and have begun to adjust wages and appropriately reduce rents and various public utility charges. However, there are still some problems in the material and cultural lives of the working masses that need to be further resolved. In the future, in addition to educating enterprise leading cadres to further strengthen the mass viewpoint and earnestly care about the hardships in the lives of the masses, we have decided to include enterprise leading cadres regularly going deep to understand the living conditions of the working masses as one of the enterprise management systems; when inspecting the completion of production plans, we must also inspect the completion of safety, health, and welfare plans, and conduct rewards or criticisms in the same way. We also suggest that relevant state departments should rationally allocate welfare investment issues according to the different situations of various enterprises. Enterprises with poor working conditions should be more than general enterprises, and special welfare for female workers should be effectively taken care of. It is also suggested that in cities with concentrated heavy industry (such as Anshan and Fuxin), some light industry should be appropriately developed where possible to help solve the marriage problems of employees.

Resolutely Change the Working Style of Party Organizations at All Levels

Finally, to achieve the above requirements, and truly strengthen the Party's leadership over enterprises and rely on the working masses to run industrial enterprises well, the key lies in resolutely changing the working style of Party organizations at all levels. Only by regularly going deep into the masses, going deep into production practice, and conducting systematic investigations and research can we truly reflect the opinions and demands of the masses, and rely on the wisdom of the masses to overcome the limitations in our understanding and correctly solve problems. This change in work style must be led by the provincial Party committee.

In the two years since the establishment of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, although it has generally implemented the central government's policies and completed the Party's tasks, there are still serious shortcomings of subjectivism and bureaucratism in the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee. We painfully feel that being divorced from reality and divorced from the masses is the fatal wound of our work style. We are often satisfied with general appeals, and spend too much time and energy on unnecessary meetings and documents, and have not gone to contact grassroots activities in an organized and planned way, and lack systematic investigation and research work. Therefore, we cannot discover and solve problems in a timely manner. Because we lack in-depth practice and lack regular contact with the masses, we often fail to report the situation to the central government in a timely manner on many issues, and we often fail to deeply understand the instructions of the central government, and therefore implement them ineffectively. For example, in solving the problem of the enterprise leadership system, although we criticized the mistake of one-sidedly emphasizing the power of administrative leadership and weakening the leadership of the Party in the struggle to eliminate Gao Gang's influence after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, because we did not conduct in-depth investigation and research and comprehensively summarize experience, we did not clearly and firmly realize that we must fundamentally change the enterprise leadership system on the issue of enterprise leadership. Therefore, this issue has been in a state of contradiction and confusion for a long time.

In summary, although we have done some work in the past few years, the leadership situation and work achievements are far behind the needs of production development, and far behind the actual possibilities. We have failed to better rely on the working masses, and failed to fully mobilize the socialist labor enthusiasm of the working masses. In the future, we are determined to follow the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, earnestly change our work style, go deep into the masses, contact reality, and resolutely overcome bureaucratic and subjectivist styles; resolutely implement the system of combining the Party's collective leadership with individual responsibility in enterprises; strengthen the Party's ideological work and organizational construction work in enterprises; care about the lives and hardships of the masses of employees, and always pay attention to maintaining and expanding the close ties between the Party and the working masses, ensure that the Party's mass line is implemented in industrial enterprises, and fully mobilize all positive factors of the working class to strive to better complete the tasks given to us by the Party and the country.

    党对工业企业领导的一些经验教训
    中共辽宁省委第一书记　黄欧东
    一般情况
    党的第八次代表大会的任务是巩固地团结全党团结全国人民群众，团结国际上一切可能团结的力量，发挥一切积极因素，把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。辽宁地区是我国社会主义工业建设基地之一，1953年开始执行第一个五年计划后，在辽宁地区不仅对原有企业不断地进行改建和扩建；并且进行了大规模的新建工程，限额以上的工业建设单位共有七十四项，其中有二十四项是属于一百五十六项重点工程的。据年初统计全省有大小工矿一千八百三十四个，职工共八十三万余人，现代工业占全省工农业总产值的69.1％。今后为充分发挥这一基地的作用，辽宁省党组织的任务是很艰巨的。几年来由于中央的正确领导，广大工人群众的积极努力，伟大的苏联和各社会主义国家的真诚援助，辽宁地区的工业建设获得了重大的成就，在工业产值和劳动生产率以及主要产品产量方面逐年都超额地完成了国家计划。如在中央各工业部所属企业中，到8月末已有七十五个企业提前达到1957年生产水平，大部分的国营工业企业也将提前一年或一年半达到1957年的水平。但是，由于辽宁省各级党组织，首先是辽宁省委本身努力不够，对工业建设的中心任务抓得不紧，以致工业企业中在全面贯彻党的政策和完成国家计划上，在技术改造和技术力量的培养上，以及产品质量问题上都存在着许多缺点。但是我认为目前工业企业中存在的最严重的问题，就是在工业企业中存在着削弱党的领导的倾向，和对党的七届二中全会决议中所明确规定的“依靠工人阶级是党在城市工作的根本路线”以及对党中央所一贯强调的群众路线贯彻执行不够的问题。这是关系发扬职工积极性，保证社会主义建设的根本问题。因此，我想根据几年来的经验教训，就这方面的问题提出一些意见。
    党中央为加强党对工业企业的领导所规定的实行集体领导和个人负责相结合的领导制度，是完全正确的。党是工人阶级的最高组织形式，党的力量的泉源是来自群众。只有依靠党的集体领导和群众的智慧，才是做好一切工作的根本保证。管理企业也完全不能例外。这是在我们多年来的实际工作中所证明了的真理。
    过去辽宁地区在工业企业中长期存在的降低党的领导作用，过分强调行政领导的权力的错误，是将企业中党的集体领导与个人分工负责对立起来，把行政上的厂长负责制与党的群众路线对立起来，把政治工作与经济工作对立起来。因而在许多企业中发展了命令主义、惩办主义等脱离群众的倾向。许多企业只要由上而下的行政管理，不要由下而上的群众监督；忽视对于社会主义竞赛和先进生产者运动的领导，不去认真发动和采纳职工群众的合理化建议；职工大会、职工代表会、生产会议等长期不召开或流于形式；在“技术无民主”的论调下排斥了企业中实行民主管理的作法；有些企业还推行了只有行政领导发号施令完全剥夺别人发言权的“作业会议”的制度；有的企业实行了名目繁多的处罚工人的办法，随意辞退工人、罚扣工资甚至污辱人格。严重地伤害了群众积极性和创造性，使企业中生产潜力不能得到很好的发挥，企业管理中的缺点和错误也得不到及时的克服。这类企业是不能很好地完成国家的生产建设计划的。
    另一方面，凡是生产获得优异成绩的较先进的企业单位，却是完全另一种情况。由于他们继承和坚持了党的集体领导的传统，发挥群众智慧来完成生产任务，经常开展群众性的批评和监督，组织群众参与企业管理和激发他们的劳动积极性。因而那里的党内党外的民主生活是很正常的，是生气勃勃的。企业领导和群众联系是比较紧密的，那里群众的觉悟程度和生产积极性比较高，也就能够很好的完成生产任务。
    这些经验教训充分说明在企业中坚决推行党的集体领导和个人负责相结合的领导制度，彻底纠正过去的错误做法，这是加强党对企业领导的根本问题。
    加强党在企业中的政治思想工作
    加强党的领导，依靠工人阶级办好企业，这一党领导工业企业的根本路线，要求我们首先加强党的政治工作。因此，必须大力克服那种低估政治思想工作的有害倾向。这实际上是低估党的作用的反映。政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线，必须将党的政治思想工作，深入到企业的经济活动和技术领域中去，以体现党对经济工作的领导。目前有些企业中党的干部还不注意将党的领导引向日益发展的经济问题中去，实际上这就是实行政治工作与经济工作的分离。这种倾向是必须要纠正的。其次，经验证明，我们还必须发动基层组织不仅将政治工作深入到生产中去，而且要深入到职工生活中去。过去企业中党的政治工作具有很大的片面性，就是只注意生产技术中的思想工作，而不注意做好职工生活中的思想工作；只注意职工在生产中的思想表现，而不注意职工在生活中的思想动态；只注意职工在厂矿工作时间、特别在业余活动中进行政治思想工作，而很少深入工人生产和生活中进行政治思想工作，特别是忽视职工在厂外和社会活动中的思想领导。因此，我们认为党的工作的全面开展，必须是使政治思想工作不仅在生产技术中进行，而且还必须深入到职工生活中去。党组织不仅要解决职工生产技术活动中的问题，而且要解决他们生活中的思想问题。党的政治思想工作不仅要在厂矿内部进行，而且要扩展到职工住宅中去。使生产、生活和教育密切结合，使工厂与社会、个人与家庭密切结合起来。只有这样，党的政治工作才是深入的巩固的。
    此外，根据当前企业中党的基层组织情况，加强党的政治思想工作还必须提倡分别对待的方法。因为党组织工作的实质是对人的工作，人的潜力是企业中最大的潜力。我们许多企业中党组织对于党员和群众，是一般号召多，具体地分别对待少。因此为贯彻党的群众路线，做好群众工作，必须强调支持和培植先进事物，提高中间，转变落后。支持先进和转变落后是一个事情的两个方面。过去我们企业的政治工作最大的一个问题，是不能根据落后和中间状态进行工作。对先进、中间和落后的同等看待，不善于分别发动。因此必须学会以先进带动落后，提高中间。这是党的群众路线的最重要的问题。去年我们为了响应全国党代表会议关于“全党动员起来，兢兢业业，克服困难，努力增产，厉行节约”的号召，进行了广泛的思想教育工作，开展了全面的增产节约运动；今年在响应党中央和毛主席反对右倾保守思想，要求又多、又快、又好、又省，加速社会主义建设的号召的思想基础上掀起来的工业高潮，充分证明党的思想工作的作用。经验证明：思想工作越深入，运动的开展也越饱满、越健康。如果放松了运动的领导，放松在运动中的思想工作，群众运动也就可能出现一些偏差。今年在辽宁省的工业高潮中就有这种情况。由于我们满足于一般化的号召和形式上的轰轰烈烈，没有深入了解运动的发展情况，总结运动经验，因而没有及时地发现工业高潮与全面完成国家计划有脱节的情况，进行及时的思想教育和具体帮助，以致有些企业在高潮中也没有全面完成国家计划，甚至还有质量下降、事故增多的情况。有些人没有看到运动的积极方面，只看到这些偏差的现象，但对产生偏差的原因不加研究，因而出现一些怀疑，否定群众运动的论调，如说“运动只能破坏，不能建设”，认为群众的意见是零碎的不可取的等等，这显然是不对的。其实质是取消群众运动的观点，是缺乏依靠群众观点的具体表现。
    为了加强企业中的政治思想工作，我们强调党组织从日常事务工作中解脱出来，克服党不管党的倾向，企业中党组织应该着重研究讨论生产和行政工作中的重大问题，主要从政策上、思想上来研究完成国家计划和改进企业管理中的关键问题。从而一方面发挥行政领导的积极性和主动性，一方面使党组织能够集中力量做好党的各项政治思想工作。强调所有企业党的工作干部要深入生产，深入群众，认真钻研党的政策，学习经济业务知识，迅速消灭这方面的无知状态。使政治工作和经济工作密切结合，更有效地加强政治思想领导，发挥政治思想工作的作用，不断地提高职工群众的觉悟水平。
    依靠工人群众，关心职工群众的生活
    我们要依靠工人群众，提高职工群众的觉悟，必须在加强思想教育工作的同时，还要极大的关心职工群众的生活问题。几年来我们在发展生产基础上，虽然也一般地注意了改善职工的生活，但是却存在着片面地强调个人利益服从国家利益，眼前利益服从长远利益，而实际上忽视职工生活疾苦的偏差。如某些企业的职工患职业病和慢性病的现象严重，但医药费却有大量节余；职工的生活困难得不到解决，但生活救济费却经常积存；在未实行工资改革以前，有些企业的职工工资太低，没有及时地调整，有些职工应该晋级的也没有及时晋级，但正是在这些企业中的工资基金总完不成计划，这些现象严重地影响了工人群众的生产积极性和党与群众的联系。由于中央和国务院及时发觉了这种情况，已经采取了一系列的措施来纠正这个偏向。根据中央和国务院的指示，我们已做了一些调查研究工作，已经着手调整工资，适当降低了房租和各种公用事业的收费标准。但是工人群众的物质文化生活中还有一些问题需要继续加以解决，今后除了教育企业领导干部进一步加强群众观点，认真关心群众的生活疾苦外，我们已决定，将企业领导干部经常深入了解工人群众的生活状况列为企业管理制度之一；在检查生产计划完成情况时，必须同时检查安全、卫生、生活福利计划的完成情况，同样地进行奖励或批评。我们也建议国家各有关部门在分配福利投资问题上，应该根据各企业的不同情况合理的分配，对于劳动条件差的企业应较多于一般企业，对于女工的特殊福利应予以切实照顾。并建议在重工业集中的城市（如鞍山、阜新）在可能条件下，要适当发展一些轻工业，以帮助解决职工的婚姻问题。切实转变各级党组织的工作作风
    最后，实现上述要求，真正做到加强党对企业的领导，依靠工人群众办好工业企业，关键在于切实转变各级党组织的工作作风。我们只有经常深入群众，深入生产实际，进行系统的调查研究，才能真实地反映群众的意见和要求，依靠群众的智慧，来克服我们认识上的局限性，正确的解决问题。而这种转变作风，必须由省委带头做起。
    辽宁省委成立的二年中，虽然也一般的贯彻执行了中央的方针政策，完成了党的任务。但是省委领导上还存在着严重的主观主义、官僚主义的缺点。我们痛感脱离实际、脱离群众是我们工作作风的致命伤。我们常常满足于一般化的号召，把过多的时间精力花费在不必要的会议上和文件上，没有有组织有计划地去接触下层活动，更缺少系统地调查研究工作。因此就不能及时发现问题，解决问题。由于我们缺少深入实际，缺少经常联系群众，所以对许多问题往往不能及时地向中央反映情况，对中央的指示，也往往领会不深，因而贯彻执行不力。如在解决企业领导制度问题上，虽然我们在党的七届四中全会以后，进行肃清高岗影响的斗争中，批判了片面强调行政领导的权力，削弱党的领导的错误，但由于我们没有进行深入调查研究和全面地总结经验，所以在企业领导问题上，就没有明确地坚定地认识到要从根本上改变企业领导制度。因而，对这一问题长期处于矛盾和混乱中。
    总起来说，我们几年来虽然做了一些工作，但是领导状况和工作成就却是远远落后于生产发展的需要，远远落后于实际可能，我们未能更好的依靠工人群众，未能充分发挥工人群众的社会主义劳动热情。今后我们有决心按照党的八次代表大会的精神，认真转变我们的工作作风，深入群众，联系实际，切实克服官僚主义、主观主义作风；在企业中坚决实行党的集体领导和个人负责相结合的制度；加强企业中党的思想工作和组织建设工作；关心职工群众的生活和疾苦，时刻注意保持和扩大党和工人群众的密切联系，保证党的群众路线在工业企业中得到贯彻执行，把工人阶级的一切积极因素充分的调动起来，为更好地完成党和国家所给予我们的任务而奋斗。
