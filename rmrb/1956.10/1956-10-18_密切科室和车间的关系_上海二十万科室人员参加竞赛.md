Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th. By the end of September, 200,000 technical and management personnel in Shanghai's factories and enterprises had participated in the socialist competition. Among those participating in inter-factory department competitions, the heavy industry system had 88 departments, the light industry system had 203 departments from 83 factories, and 114 textile factories had their supply and sales, finance, and planning departments participating.

Zhou Bingkun, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, in summarizing the experience of factories in carrying out department competitions for more than half a year, said: After the launch of the department competition, a very significant effect was to promote the use of the mass line working method by department personnel, improve work, and improve the level of enterprise management. Many factory departments have seized the fundamental work of their departments in the competition, carried out systematic analysis and research, widely solicited the opinions of the workers, and made major improvements in technology and management systems. The Shanghai Electric Motor Factory's Technology Department, which first adopted such improvement methods, extensively mobilized all factory workers to discuss when revising the technological regulations; during the discussion, the workers put forward more than 600 improvement measures, and only 150 of them, after being implemented, could save 148,000 man-hours a year.

In the past, the technical inspection department of State-owned Cotton Mill No. 17 and the inspection department of Shanghai Tool Factory used to sit in the office to inspect finished products, rarely going down to the workshop. The workers at the tool factory called the inspectors "masters." Since the launch of the competition, they have gone deep into the workshops to help the workshops inspect semi-finished products and study the reasons why workers produce defective products. As a result, the number of defective products has been reduced, and the workers are also satisfied. The standard cotton yarn product of State-owned Cotton Mill No. 17 was only 17.94% in March, but it had risen to more than 95% in September.

In the first half of this year, more than 9,000 department personnel in Shanghai have put forward more than 120,000 rationalization proposals, of which the part that can be calculated in value can create nearly 10 million yuan of wealth for the country in one year. In the second quarter, more than 27,000 department staff were rated as advanced producers, accounting for one-third of the total number of advanced workers rated in the city.

The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened a department competition work experience exchange meeting on October 12, calling on trade unions throughout the city to further strengthen their leadership over department competition work, and calling on department personnel to better rely on the masses to improve their work.

    密切科室和车间的关系
    上海二十万科室人员参加竞赛
    新华社上海15日电　到9月底止，上海市工厂企业中已有二十万科室技术人员和管理人员参加了社会主义竞赛。参加厂际科室竞赛的，重工业系统有八十八个科室，轻工业系统有八十三个厂的二百零三个科室和一百十四个纺织工厂的供销、财务及计划等科室。
    市工会联合会副主席周炳坤在总结半年多来工厂开展科室竞赛的经验时说：开展科室竞赛以后，很显著的效果是推动了科室人员用群众路线的工作方法，改进了工作，提高了企业管理水平。不少工厂的科室在竞赛中抓住本部门的根本性工作，进行系统的分析研究，广泛征求工人群众的意见，从技术上、管理制度上作出了重大的改进。最早采取这样改进方法的上海电机厂工艺科，在修改工艺规程的时候，曾经广泛地发动全厂工人讨论；在讨论当中，工人们共提出了六百多项改进措施，仅其中的一百五十项经过实施以后，一年就可以节省十四万八千个工时。
    国棉十七厂的技术检查科和上海工具厂的检验科，过去都是坐在办公室里检查成品，很少下车间。工具厂工人叫检验员是“老爷”。竞赛开展以来，他们都深入车间，帮助车间检查半成品，并且研究工人出废品的原因。结果次品废品减少了，工人也满意。国棉十七厂3月份的棉纱标准品只有17.94％，9月份已经上升到95％以上了。
    在今年上半年，上海市已有九千多个科室人员共提出了十二万多条合理化建议，其中可以计算出价值的部分，一年就能为国家创造近一千万元财富。第二季度，全市有二万七千多个科室工作人员被评为先进生产者，占全市评出的先进者总数的三分之一。
    市工会联合会在10月12日召开了科室竞赛工作经验交流会，号召全市工会进一步加强对科室竞赛工作的领导，并且号召科室人员更好地依靠群众改进工作。
