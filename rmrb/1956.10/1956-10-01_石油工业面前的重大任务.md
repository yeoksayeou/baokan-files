Major Tasks Facing the Petroleum Industry
Speech by Comrade Li Jukui, Minister of Petroleum Industry

To meet the needs of national economic development, the state's demands on the petroleum industry are urgent. The current working foundation of the petroleum industry is still very small. Therefore, the task before the petroleum industry is to find more reserves as soon as possible.

The current situation of the petroleum industry, as pointed out by Comrade Zhou Enlai in his report, is that it is a backward sector in industry. Not only is the output low, but especially the resources are unclear. Crude oil production is expected to meet only about 40% of the country's needs by 1957, and the varieties are too few and the quality is not high. The proven recoverable reserves are only 30 million tons.

Since liberation, although resource exploration has been carried out and the original oil fields and synthetic petroleum factories have been restored and expanded, the crude oil production has increased somewhat. The crude oil production expected this year is 3.5 times the highest annual output before liberation. However, compared with the development level of the entire national economy, it is still far from adequate.

The reasons for the backwardness of the petroleum industry, in addition to the small original foundation, have also been due to insufficient development in recent years. This is because of insufficient understanding of the importance of the petroleum industry in the process of national industrialization, insufficient estimation of the serious consequences that would be caused by the long-term backwardness of the petroleum industry; lack of in-depth research on the complexity of geological exploration work to ascertain petroleum resources; lack of clarity on the need to carry out a large amount of exploration work and spend the necessary investment to find the necessary petroleum reserves. Therefore, in the first three years of the first five-year plan, the plan was set too small, the growth of exploration forces was not enough, not fast enough, and too little work was done. Within three years, only 13,000 square kilometers of geological exploration area was carried out, which is less than 5/1000 of the area of ​​China's promising oil-bearing areas; only 415,000 meters of wells were drilled within three years. Obviously, such a small amount of work cannot achieve greater results; secondly, there are some defects in the deployment of exploration work. In the past few years, the limited exploration forces have been placed in several small basins, or in local areas of large basins. It failed to grasp the basins with greater oil-bearing hope and wider areas for comprehensive exploration. It was not good at comprehensively using various exploration methods such as geology, geophysics, structural drilling, and deep well drilling, so the results were not significant.

Does China have abundant petroleum resources? According to existing data, judging from geological conditions, the area of ​​China's promising oil-bearing areas is about 3 million square kilometers, and more than 200 oil seepages are known. Junggar and Tarim Basins in Xinjiang, Qaidam Basin in Qinghai, Hexi area in Gansu, Heihe in Tibet, Ordos Platform, Sichuan Basin, parts of Guizhou and Guangxi, North China Plain, Songliao Plain, etc. are all areas where it is hoped that oil can be found. Judging from the exploration work in recent years: the Karamay oil field discovered in the Junggar Basin of Xinjiang has obtained industrially valuable free-flowing oil from 23 exploration wells that have been tested for oil. The oil field area has reached 130 square kilometers, and the oil storage area is still expanding. Recoverable reserves will be over 100 million tons; in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai, oil flow has been seen in the Youquanzi structure, and crude oil has sprayed out in the No. 4 Lenghu structure during shallow drilling; in the Baxian Petroleum Gully-Dongxi structure and Yongchuan County Huangguashan structure in Sichuan, strong gas eruptions occurred during the drilling process. Based only on the discovery of these oil and gas fields, the fallacy of "China's oil poverty" can be refuted. On the contrary, whether from geological conditions or actual exploration results, it shows that China's petroleum resources are abundant.

However, the large variability of petroleum deposits increases the complexity of exploration work. At present, geological science can only make scientific inferences about oil-bearing prospects, and cannot definitively point out that a certain structure must have oil. Therefore, petroleum exploration work generally takes a considerable period of time, conducts various investigations and studies, and only after drilling can the oil area be confirmed and the reserves ascertained. The experience of many oil-producing countries in the world is the same. For example, the Soviet Union went through 20 years of exploration work before the Second Baku appeared. According to China's existing geological data, results can only be obtained after thorough exploration and regional comprehensive analysis and research, and a large number of wells are drilled. Of course, we have the help of the Soviet Union and other brother countries, and accept their advanced experience, and we may take fewer detours in the future. According to the several oil-bearing areas currently known, it is possible to find one or two large oil areas within two or three years if exploration is continued.

The Central Committee's proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan stipulates that crude oil production will reach 5 to 6 million tons by 1962, which is appropriate. In order to achieve this goal, we must strive to reach 300 to 400 million tons of recoverable reserves by 1962. To this end, we must carry out extensive geological exploration work, strengthen the construction of existing oil fields, continue to find new oil fields, and develop four to six large-scale oil and gas fields during the Second Five-Year Plan period. It is expected that 6 to 8 million meters of wells will be drilled during the Second Five-Year Plan. Greatly increase the monthly speed of drilling rigs, strive to save steel, strengthen management, reduce accidents, and strive to greatly reduce drilling costs.

To meet the needs of national economic development, the state's demands on the petroleum industry are urgent. Judging from the current situation of the petroleum industry, the working foundation is still very small. Therefore, the task before the petroleum industry is to find more reserves as soon as possible. To this end, we must strengthen leadership, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of all employees, vigorously train various technical personnel, strengthen scientific research, and continuously absorb advanced experience to ensure the completion of this task.

    石油工业面前的重大任务
    石油工业部部长　李聚奎同志的发言
    根据国民经济发展的需要，国家对石油工业的要求是迫切的，目前石油工业的工作基础还很微小，因此摆在石油工业面前的任务，就是要尽快地找到更多的储量。
    目前石油工业的情况，正如周恩来同志在报告中所指出的：是工业中的落后部门，不仅产量少，尤其是资源不清。原油产量预计到一九五七年仅能满足国家需要的百分之四十左右，而且品种太少，质量不高。已查明的可采储量，还只有三千万吨。
    解放后，虽然进行了资源勘探并恢复和扩建了原有的油田及人造石油工厂，使原油产量有所增长，今年预计生产的原油为解放前最高年产量的三点五倍。但是和整个国民经济的发展水平比较，还是远不相适应的。
    石油工业的这种落后原因，除原有基础微小外，几年来发展的也不够快，这是由于对石油工业在国家工业化过程中的重要性认识不够，对石油工业长期落后而会造成的严重后果估计不足；对查明石油资源的地质勘探工作的复杂性缺乏深刻的研究；对要找到必需的石油储量就得作大量的勘探工作和花费必需的投资不够明确，因而在第一个五年计划的前三年，计划摆小了，勘探力量增长的不够多，不够快，工作做少了。三年内只做了一万三千平方公里的地质勘探面积，还不到我国有希望含油地区面积的千分之五；三年内只钻井四十一点五万公尺。显然，这样少的工作量，是不可能得到更大的效果的；其次在勘探工作的布置上又有些缺陷，以往几年把有限的勘探力量，放在几个小的盆地、或者是大盆地的局部地区内进行工作，未能抓住含油希望较大，面积较广的盆地进行全面勘探，对地质、地球物理、构造钻井、深井钻探等各种勘探方法，不善于综合使用，因而收效不大。
    我国究竟有没有丰富的石油资源呢？根据现有的资料，从地质条件来看：我国有希望含油地区的面积约三百万平方公里，已知油苗二百多处。新疆的准葛尔、塔里木、青海柴达木、甘肃河西地区、西藏黑河、鄂尔多斯地台、四川盆地、贵州、广西部分地区、华北平原、松辽平原等，都是有希望找到石油的地区。再从几年来的勘探工作情况来看：新疆准葛尔盆地，已经发现的克拉玛依油田，经过试油的二十三口探井中，均得到了有工业价值的自喷油流，油田面积已达一百三十平方公里，储油面积还在扩大，可采储量将在一亿吨以上；青海柴达木盆地，油泉子构造已见到油流，冷湖四号构造在浅钻过程中喷出了原油；四川巴县石油沟—东溪构造和永川县黄瓜山构造，在钻井过程中发生了强烈的气喷。仅仅根据这些油、气田的发现，就可以驳倒所谓“中国贫油”的谬论。相反的，无论从地质条件和实际勘探结果来看，都说明我国石油资源是丰富的。
    但是，由于石油蕴藏的变动性大，增加了勘探工作的复杂性，目前的地质科学，还只能对含油远景做出科学的推论，不能肯定指出某一个构造一定有油。因而石油勘探工作一般地要经过相当长的时间，进行各种调查研究，经过钻探后，才能肯定油区，查明储量。世界上许多产油国家的经验都是如此，例如：苏联经过二十年的勘探工作，才出现了第二巴库。根据我国现有的地质资料，只有经过周密的勘探和区域性的综合分析研究后，进行大量打井，才能获得结果。当然我们有苏联等兄弟国家的帮助，接受他们的先进经验，今后可能少走一些弯路。根据目前已了解的几个含油地区，继续加强勘探，在两三年内，找到一两个大的油区是有可能的。
    中央对第二个五年计划的建议中，规定原油产量一九六二年达到五至六百万吨，这是适当的。为了实现这一指标，必须争取在一九六二年达到三至四亿吨可采储量。为此就必须进行广泛的地质勘探工作，加强现有油田的建设，继续寻找新的油田，在第二个五年计划期间内须开发四至六个规模较大的油、气田。预计在第二个五年内，钻井六至八百万公尺。大大提高钻机月速度，努力节省钢材，加强管理，减少事故，以求大力降低钻井成本。
    根据国民经济发展的需要，国家对石油工业的要求是迫切的，根据石油工业的目前情况来看，工作基础还是很微小，因此摆在石油工业面前的任务，就是要尽快地找到更多的储量。为此，必须加强领导，发挥全体职工的积极性和创造性，大力培养各种技术人员，加强科学研究工作，不断地吸取先进经验，保证这个任务的完成。
