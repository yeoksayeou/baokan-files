    Developer for Film Development
    The state-owned Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory has recently successfully trial-produced a new product: Metol.
    Metol is a developer used for film development. In the past, China could not manufacture it domestically and relied entirely on imports.
    The Metol trial-produced by this factory is made from sodium nitrophenolate, a byproduct of the phenacetin production process, plus chloroacetic acid and other raw materials. The trial production cost of Metol is only half the price of imported goods, and the quality is equal to that of imported goods.
    This factory will officially start producing Metol next year. Based on the factory's production capacity, it can produce more than 20 tons annually, which can basically meet domestic needs.

    冲洗胶片用的显影剂
    国营山东新华制药厂最近试制成功一种新产品——米妥尔。
    米妥尔是冲洗胶片用的一种显影剂，过去我国自己不能制造，都由国外进口。
    这个厂试制的米妥尔是利用非那昔丁生产过程中的副产品——硝基酚钠，再加上氯乙酸等作原料制成的。米妥尔的试制成本，仅抵进口货价格的二分之一，质量与进口货相等。
    这个厂将在明年开始正式生产米妥尔，根据全厂生产能力，每年可生产出二十多吨，基本上可以满足国内的需要。
