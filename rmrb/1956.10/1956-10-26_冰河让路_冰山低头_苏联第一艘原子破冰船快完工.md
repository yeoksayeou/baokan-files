    Glaciers Give Way, Icebergs Bow
    The Soviet Union's First Nuclear-Powered Icebreaker Nears Completion
    (Our Moscow dispatch, October 25th) The assembly of the main components of the Soviet Union's first nuclear-powered icebreaker has been completed. This ship is being built at the Leningrad Shipyard. It can navigate unrestrictedly in the vast and frigid polar seas, unafraid of icebergs and glaciers, and can easily break through ice layers two meters thick. The fuel stored on this nuclear-powered icebreaker is sufficient for one year of operation in icy waters. The nuclear fuel consumed each day is only a few tens of centimeters. The ship's hull is one hundred and thirty-four meters long and twenty-seven meters wide, with a displacement of sixteen thousand tons and an engine capacity of forty-four thousand horsepower. The ship is equipped with comprehensive equipment to protect against radioactive hazards to the human body, as well as facilities such as clubs, libraries, concert halls, and clinics.
