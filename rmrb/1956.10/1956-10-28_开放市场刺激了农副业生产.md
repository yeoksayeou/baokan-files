    Open Market Stimulates Agricultural and Sideline Production

    Xianning Nan Bamboo Massively Shipped and Sold to Wuhan
    Large quantities of nan bamboo grow in the deep mountains of Gaoqiao District, Xianning County, Hubei Province. In the past, due to insufficient local labor and excessively strict market management, no one felled them. After the rural market's management was relaxed, some agricultural cooperatives in the plains actively proposed to fell and transport nan bamboo to the mountains. The Niejiashan Agricultural Cooperative alone signed a contract to fell and transport 2,800 nan bamboo poles. Xianning County's miscellaneous wooden sticks, crate boards, charcoal, and firewood were historically transported and sold to Wuhan. However, due to excessively strict market management, local farmers could not transport and sell them, and merchants from other places could not go deep into the producing areas to purchase them, so farmers produced very little. In recent months, due to the opening of the market, farmers have been very enthusiastic about production, and large quantities of products have already been shipped and sold to Wuhan.

    Pig and Chicken Production Increases in Tangxia District
    Due to the opening of free markets under state leadership, the Tangxia District of Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, has increased farmers' enthusiasm for engaging in sideline production. For example, the Central Township First Agricultural Production Cooperative only raised eight pigs before July, but now raises twenty-six. Farmer Liang Baiming raised ninety chickens and ducks, one sow, and twelve piglets after the market opened. Generally speaking, in terms of developing sideline production in agricultural cooperatives, because the opening of free markets has been relatively short and seedlings are lacking, the increase in production is not large; however, it is very significant in promoting the development of farmers' household sideline production.

    Rural Workshops in Shandong Develop
    Since Shandong Province agricultural cooperatives have been carrying out diversified operations, especially after the rural markets were opened, the most prominent development has been the great recovery and development of rural processing workshops (flour mills, oil mills, tofu workshops, etc.). According to statistics from the Fourteenth District of Cao County, there were originally 114 workshops, and now there are plans to add 71 more. In Juye County, almost every agricultural cooperative out of more than 1,000 has a workshop. After the market opened, the amount of self-produced and self-sold agricultural and sideline products of agricultural cooperatives and farmers in various places increased.

    开放市场刺激了农副业生产
    咸宁楠竹大量运销武汉
    湖北咸宁县高桥区的深山里生长大批楠竹，过去由于当地劳动力不足，而市场又管理过死过严，所以无人砍伐；农村市场放宽管理后，平原地区有些农业社就主动提出到山里砍运楠竹，只聂家山一个农业社签订了砍运楠竹二千八百根的合同。咸宁县出产的杂木棍、箱板、木炭、木柴，历史上是运销武汉，由于市场管理过死，当地农民不能运销，外地商贩又不能深入产地采购，农民很少生产。最近几月来，由于市场开放，农民生产劲头很足，已有大量产品运销武汉。
    棠下区猪、鸡、产量增加
    广东新会县棠下区由于开放了国家领导下的自由市场，提高了农民从事副业生产的积极性。例如，中心乡第一农业生产合作社7月份以前只养猪八头，现在已养猪二十六头；农民梁百明在市场开放后，养了鸡、鸭九十只，母猪一头，小猪十二头。一般说，在农业社发展副业生产方面，因为开放自由市场时间较短，种苗缺乏，所以增产数量不大；但是在促进农民家庭副业生产的发展上却很显著。
    山东农村作坊有发展
    山东省农业社开展多种经营，特别是农村市场开放以后，比较突出的是农村加工作坊业（粉房、油房、豆腐房等）有了很大的恢复和发展。据曹县十四区的统计，原有作坊一百十四处，现又筹划增添七十一处；巨野县一千多个农业社，差不多社社有了作坊。各地农业社和农民在市场开放后，自产自销的农副产品数量有了增加。
