Australia, China and the Olympic Games
By Australian writer, Noel Counihan

The People's Republic of China's sports delegation will participate in the Olympic Games to be held in Melbourne soon.

I anticipate that when the Chinese athletes enter the stadium with the five-star red flag of the People's Republic of China, they will receive the warmest welcome from all participating countries.

Readers of the People's Daily will want to know about Australia, the country to which they are sending athletes to compete with the world's top athletes; they will want to know something about the Australian people.

First, let's talk about the country. Australia is about the same size as China without Xinjiang and Tibet. In other respects, it is also very similar to China. It straddles the tropics and temperate zones. In the center of the continent, there are also arid desert areas like the Gobi, where summer temperatures reach 32 to 42 degrees Celsius. The climate in the north of the continent is the same as that of Guangdong.

The climate in other parts of the continent is mild. During the day in winter, the temperature rarely drops below 10 degrees Celsius, and in summer, the temperature only exceeds 30 degrees Celsius for one or two weeks. Cattle and sheep graze in open pastures all year round. There are only two small mountains on the entire continent with enough snow for skiing during the short winter.

Australia's mild climate (with the exception of the extreme heat in the interior of the continent in summer) is because it does not have land directly connected to the perpetually snow-covered Antarctic region. It is 1,000 miles from Antarctica and is surrounded by the Pacific, Indian and South China Seas.

What kind of weather will Chinese athletes encounter in November? Melbourne is a city in Australia with changeable weather. In November, the climate is generally mild, but sometimes there are torrential rains, and sometimes even cold winds. But it is not as hot as Beijing in summer, nor as cold as Beijing in November.

What are the Australian people like?

I recall the day in July when Professor Zhang and I climbed a steep hill in Nanjing and hung a wreath at the Martyrs' Cemetery. He excitedly told me about the friendship and warm reception he received during a short visit to Australia a few years ago.

I said this represents Australia; because ordinary Australians are very much like ordinary Chinese people, with a deep sense of friendship. I said to him: "When I say: I feel at home in China, that explains everything."

Australia is a new country. She is a young country. She has the shortcomings of youth, but also the virtues of youth - frankness, simplicity, and love. She has not been contaminated by many of the evils of the old European continent. Although British descent is absolutely dominant, there is no such class distinction as in England. No Australian feels inferior. No Australian wants to consider others "higher than him"; or consider himself "lower class."

Although Australia is a member of the loose organization of the Commonwealth, it is an emerging country. She often makes her own decisions in international affairs - but is often influenced by external pressures. She has not yet recognized China. This is because some Australian capitalists believe that the United States has a more stubborn anti-communist stance than Britain. In addition, under the constant and shameless propaganda of the "Catholic Action," some Australians have been instilled with a blind and unthinking hatred for everything labeled "socialist" and "communist," so among these deceived people there is an anti-Chinese sentiment. However, such people are only a minority. Not only do ordinary Australians like Chinese people, but, as I pointed out in my article in the People's Daily on September 9, a major change has taken place in the ruling group. Although the official attitude of the Conservative government reflects American policy and responds to the propaganda of the China Lobby, major Australian newspapers have published objective reports about China, and Australia's most important newspaper - the "Sydney Morning Herald" - has also condemned the unrealistic policy of depriving China of its legitimate seat in the United Nations.

Also, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (government-controlled) has scheduled broadcast time to report on China - this is clear evidence of a split in the ruling group and the weakening of pro-American forces under the pressure of public opinion.

Australian capitalists give every newcomer a false impression. They have modern big cities. China has only five cities with more population than Australian cities. But the entire population of Australia is only nine million, which is not even the total population of China's Shanghai and Beijing.

Melbourne, where the Games will be held, with its wide avenues and tree-lined streets, will remind guests of Changchun and Nanjing.

Sydney is located on the world's most beautiful and varied harbor - more beautiful than Rio de Janeiro. It faces numerous golden and silver-white beaches, with world-famous tides and swimming resorts.

The coastal area is rich, and like China, this is where the population is concentrated (if our sparse population can be called concentrated by Chinese eastern provinces standards). The interior is sparsely populated. In these areas, you can see Australian sheep farms, wheat farms, and cattle farms, which are very large by Chinese standards, covering thousands or tens of thousands of hectares. One Australian cattle farm is at least equal to a Chinese province. But there are no farmers there, and the real agricultural population is less than 20% of the total population.

Even the animals and plants are not unfamiliar to the guests. Eucalyptus trees, now found throughout South China (and many other countries), are native to Australia. They are one of the ancient species of plants. The Australian kangaroo will be familiar to those who have seen the Beijing Zoo. Seeing the Beijing Zoo reminds one of the Sydney Zoo, which is recognized as the best zoo in the world. It is not surprising that Australia has the oldest animals still living, because it is the oldest continent in the world.

Guests - which will include most of the countries participating in the Games - will be surprised by the store hours and the hours when food and alcohol are sold. They will find that most stores close at 6 pm (although there may be some extensions for foreigners attending the Games). The main reason for this is the Australian trade union, which believes that the interests of workers are paramount. Australian workers have long enjoyed a 40-hour work week, and Australian customers are used to it. The fact that there are not many small shops and small vendors here, as in most Eastern and European countries, avoids one problem and raises another.

In Australia, the first demand for an eight-hour workday began nearly a hundred years ago.

Compulsory education is implemented for young people under the age of fifteen, and middle school and university are free. Students from poor families can receive national scholarships to study. Since Australia is a capitalist country, needless to say, the vast majority of workers' children cannot enjoy these rights in order to help increase family income.

Australia is ahead in many social issues. Women have had the right to vote since 1892. We have had old-age pensions, widows' pensions, and disability pensions for a long time.

It is the country with the highest average standard of living in the world. From the early days, Australian trade unions have attached importance to establishing a general high wage level, rather than having a wealthy worker aristocracy that leaves ordinary and less skilled workers at low wages.

The visit of Chinese athletes participating in the Olympic Games and artists from Beijing will greatly benefit the spread of friendship and understanding, which is of utmost importance to the current world struggle for peaceful coexistence.

    澳大利亚、中国和奥林匹克运动大会
    澳大利亚作家　诺·佛烈希尔
    人民中国的体育代表队将参加不久要在墨尔本举行的奥林匹克运动大会。
    我预料当中国的选手们随着中华人民共和国的五星红旗入场的时候，将会受到参加竞赛的各国的最热烈的欢迎。
    人民日报的读者将愿意知道他们派出运动员前往同世界第一流运动家比赛的这个国家——澳大利亚的情况；他们将愿意知道有关澳洲人民的一些事物。
    首先谈谈这个国家。澳大利亚的面积等于中国去掉新疆和西藏。在其它方面她跟中国也很相像。她跨越热带和温带。在大陆的中心也有像戈壁那样的干燥的沙漠地带；在那里夏季的温度高达摄氏三十二度到四十二度。大陆北部的气候和广东一样。
    大陆的其它地区气候温和。在冬季的白昼，气温很少低于摄氏十度，在夏季只有一、两个礼拜温度超过了摄氏三十度。牛羊终年牧放在露天牧场上。整个大陆上只有两座小山在短促的冬季里有足够的雪来进行滑雪运动。
    澳大利亚之所以气候温和（夏天大陆腹地的酷热是例外），是因为她没有直通南极地区的终年复雪的陆地。她距南极一千英里，而由太平洋、印度洋和南海所环绕。
    中国运动员在11月里会遇到什么样的天气呢？墨尔本是澳大利亚一个气候无常的城市。在11月她的气候一般是温和的，但有时也会来个倾盆大雨，有时甚至还会刮起寒风来。但是她不会像北京夏天那么热，也没有11月的北京那么冷。
    澳大利亚人民又是怎么样的呢？
    我想起了在7月里和张教授在南京攀登一个陡削的小山、吊烈士墓碑的那一天，他激动地向我诉说，在几年前一次短促访问澳大利亚时他所受到的友谊和温暖的接待。
    我说这代表了澳大利亚；因为普通的澳大利亚人民极像普通的中国人民，有着深厚的友谊感。我对他说：“当我说：我在中国就像在家里一样的时候，这就把一切都说明白了。”
    澳大利亚是一个新兴的国家。她是一个年轻的国家。她有着青年人底缺点，但是也拥有青年人的美德——坦率、纯朴、友爱。她没有沾染上多少古老的欧洲大陆的那些恶行。尽管英国血统占绝对优势，但是这里丝毫没有英国的那种等级区分。没有一个澳洲人感到自己是低等人。也没有一个澳洲人愿意把别人认为“高他一等”；或认为自己是“下层阶级”。
    澳大利亚虽然是英联邦这个涣散组织的成员之一，但是它却是一个新兴的国家。她在国际事务中常自作决定权——但常常受到外界压力的影响。她还没有承认中国。这是因为一部分澳洲资本家相信美国比英国具有更顽固的反共立场。此外，一部分澳洲人在“天主教行动”的不断无耻宣传之下，被灌入了一种对一切贴有“社会主义”和“共产主义”标签的东西都盲目和不加思索地加以憎恨的情绪，因此在这些受欺骗的人中间有一种反对中国人的情绪。但是，这类人只占少数。不仅普通澳洲人民喜欢中国人，而且，正如我在9月9日人民日报的那篇文章里所指出，在统治集团里已发生了一个重大改变。尽管保守党政府的官方态度反映着美国的政策，响应着院外援华集团的宣传，但是澳洲各大报已发表了有关中国的客观报道，而澳洲最重要的一家报纸——“悉尼先驱晨报”还谴责了剥夺中国在联合国里的合法地位这种不现实的政策。
    还有，澳洲广播委员会（政府控制的）也排出了报道中国的广播时间——这是统治集团发生分裂和在舆论的压力下亲美势力削弱的显明证据。
    澳洲资本家给每个新来者以一个虚假的印象。他们有现代化的大城市。中国只有五个城市是人口多于澳洲的城市的。但是整个澳洲只有九百万人口，还赶不上中国的上海、北京两大城市的人口的总和。
    运动大会会场所在的墨尔本，将以她的宽敞的大道和绿荫成行的街道而使客人们想起了长春和南京。
    悉尼位于世界上最美丽多姿的海港上——比里约热内卢还美丽。她前临众多的金黄色的和银白色的海滩，有举世闻名的海潮和游泳胜地。
    沿海地区是富饶的，和中国一样，这儿是人口集中地（如果以中国东部各省为例把我们的稀少人口也能叫做集中的话）。内陆地区人烟稀薄。在这些地区可以看到澳洲养羊场、小麦场和养牛场，其面积以中国标准来衡量是很大的，广达几千或几万公顷。有一个澳洲养牛场至少抵得上中国的一个省。但是那里没有农民，真正的农业人口还不到总人口20％。
    连动物和植物对客人们说来也不陌生。现在已遍布南中国（还有许多国家）的有加利树，是澳洲的土产。它们是植物当中的古本之一。澳洲袋鼠对于看过北京动物园的人将是老相识了。看了北京动物园教人想起了悉尼动物园，后者是公认的世界最好的动物园。澳洲有现在还生存的最古老的动物，这是不足为奇的，因为她是世界上最老的大陆。
    客人们——这将包括参加运动大会的大部分国家，对商店的营业时间，卖酒食的时间将感到奇怪。他们将发现大部分商店到下午六时就停止了（虽然也许会对运动大会的外国人作一些延长）。其原因主要是由于澳洲的工会，它认为工人的利益是最首要的。澳洲工人早就享有四十小时工作周，而澳洲的顾客也习以为常了。这里不像大部分东方国家和欧洲国家那样，拥有许多的小商店和小商贩，这一事实省去了一个问题也提出了另一个问题。
    在澳洲第一个争取八小时工作日的要求始于近一百年以前。
    对十五岁以下的少年实施强迫义务教育，而中学和大学则是免费的。家道清贫的学生可以领取国家奖学金就读。由于澳大利亚是一个资本主义国家，毋须说，绝大部分工人子弟为了帮助增加家庭收入，而不能享受到这些权利。
    澳大利亚在许多社会问题上是走在前面的。妇女从1892年起就有了选举权。我国很早就有了养老金、寡妇抚恤金和残废抚恤金。
    她是世界上平均生活水平最高的国家。澳大利亚工会从早期起就重视建立一个普遍的高工资水平，而不愿出现一个入息丰厚的工人贵族以致使普通工人和不太熟练的工人处于低工资的水平。
    参加奥林匹克运动大会的中国选手们和北京的艺术家们的访问，将大大有利于传播友谊和了解，这对当前的争取和平共处的世界斗争有极其重大的意义。
