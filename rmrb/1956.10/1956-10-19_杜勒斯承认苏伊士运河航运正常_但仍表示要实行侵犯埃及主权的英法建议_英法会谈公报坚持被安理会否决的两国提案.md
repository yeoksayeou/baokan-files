Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 18th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles admitted at a press conference held on the 16th that navigation through the Suez Canal has been normal since it was nationalized by Egypt. He said: "So far, the shipping of Britain, France, and the United States has been normal, just as it was before the Suez Canal was nationalized." At the same time, Dulles also stated that he would insist on implementing the second part of the Anglo-French proposal, which had been rejected by the Security Council and infringed upon Egyptian sovereignty. He said: "It succinctly outlines the correct steps, and we intend to act along those lines."

Dulles also expressed his intention to insist on realizing the "Users' Association" plan. He said that this organization should act as an agent for ships and collect tolls in the capacity of these ships' agent.

Dulles was embarrassed by a correction in his remarks at a press conference on October 2nd. At that press conference, he initially said that the United States had "some differences in approach now" with Britain and France on the Suez issue, but this sentence was later corrected to "always had some differences." Many reporters asked Dulles to guarantee that there would be no more corrections to the press conference records in the future. Dulles said he could not make such a guarantee.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 18th: The Anglo-French talks on the Suez issue ended on October 17th.

The communiqué issued after the talks stated that the "Eighteen-Nation Proposal" stipulating "international management of the Suez Canal must constitute the basis for resolving the Suez Canal dispute, unless the Egyptian government proposes a system that will meet these requirements and provide the canal's users with equally effective guarantees. The communiqué also said that regarding the implementation of the principles decided by the Security Council, they decided to adhere to the second part of the original proposal.

The communiqué stated that the two governments will jointly study various proposals that Egypt may put forward regarding a system for the Suez Canal.

    杜勒斯承认苏伊士运河航运正常
    但仍表示要实行侵犯埃及主权的英法建议
    英法会谈公报坚持被安理会否决的两国提案
    据新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在16日举行的记者招待会上承认，苏伊士运河自从被埃及收归国有以来，通航一直是正常的。他说：“到现在为止，英国、法国和美国的航运的进行一直是正常的，如同苏伊士运河被收归国有以前一样”。同时，杜勒斯又表示要坚持实行遭到安全理事会否决的、侵犯埃及主权的英法提案的第二部分。他说：“它扼要地提出了正确的步骤，我们打算根据那些路线行事。”
    杜勒斯还表示要坚持实现“使用国协会”计划。他说，这个组织应当作为船只的代理人，它应当以这些船只的代理人的身份征收通行费。
    杜勒斯被他在10月2日记者招待会上的谈话中的一个更正弄得狼狈不堪。他在那次招待会上最初说美国同英国和法国对苏伊士问题“在做法上现在是有些分歧的”，后来这句话被更正为“一直是有些分歧的”。许多记者要求杜勒斯保证以后不再发生更正记者招待会记录的情况。杜勒斯说，他不能作这种保证。
    据新华社18日讯　巴黎消息：英法两国关于苏伊士问题的会谈已经在10月17日结束。
    会谈结束后发表的公报说，规定“国际管理苏伊士运河的十八国建议必须构成解决苏伊士运河争端的基础，除非埃及政府提出一个将会满足这些要求并给予运河使用国同样有效的保证的制度。公报还说，关于实施安全理事会所决定的原则，他们决定坚持原提案的第二部分。
    公报表示，两国政府将一起研究埃及可能提出的关于苏伊士运河的一个制度的各种建议。
