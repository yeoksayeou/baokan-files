    Falling in Love with the Garden and Forgetting the Workshop
    Kǒng Sāng
    According to the People's Railway News on October 25th: Comrade Zhu Shitang, the political commissar of the Mechanical Repair and Rental Station of the Lanzhou First Engineering Bureau, is very fond of flowers and trees. He is particularly concerned about a garden cultivated under his call and often appreciates it. Even when there was not enough water for daily use and drinking, Political Commissar Zhu instructed the logistics staff to use water pipes to send water to the garden for irrigation. Under Political Commissar Zhu's painstaking management, this garden finally became a flower-filled, branch-lush garden.
    In stark contrast to the flourishing garden, the production situation of the Mechanical Repair and Rental Station was very poor. By the end of September, only 50.52% of the annual rental plan had been completed; the quality of repairs was poor; and various engineering sections were unwilling to send machinery to them for repair. However, Political Commissar Zhu, as the main leader of the Party, was indifferent to production. Because he spent too much time in the garden, he rarely went to the workshop. Even when he occasionally went there, he rarely talked to the workers. If workers sought him out to discuss production issues, he would tell them to go to the station master; if they talked about life, he would tell them to go to the chairman of the trade union! It can be said that Political Commissar Zhu's mind has been occupied by that garden.
    We hope that people's lives are rich and colorful, and we encourage people to have a variety of hobbies. Fishing, planting flowers, hunting, playing ball, enjoying music, going to the theater... are all acceptable. There is only one condition: the work entrusted to us by the Party and the government must be put first, and our personal hobbies must be put second. It is absolutely not allowed for personal hobbies to interfere with work. It might be an exaggeration to label someone like Political Commissar Zhu, who loved the garden and forgot the workshop, as "living a corrupt life," but it would not be wrong to say that he is neglecting his duties.

    爱上花园忘了车间
    孔桑
    据10月25日人民铁道报载：兰州第一工程局机械修理经租站的政委——朱时堂同志，非常爱好花草树木，对在自己的号召下培植起来的一座花园，尤其关怀备至，经常在里面欣赏。即使在连用水、吃水都不够的时候，朱政委还指示总务人员用水管把水送到花园里去灌溉。这座花园在朱政委的惨淡经营下，终于成为一座花艳枝茂的花园了。
    同花园的繁茂恰成鲜明对比的，是机械修理经租站的生产情况很不好。到9月底只完成经租年计划的50.52％；修理的质量差；各工程段都不愿意把机械送给他们修理。但身为党的主要领导人的朱政委对生产却漠不关心。因为在花园里呆得太多，他很少到车间里去，即使偶尔到那里去，也很少跟工人们谈一谈。工人若找他谈生产问题，他就让工人去找站长；若谈生活，他就让工人去找工会主席！可以说，朱政委的心灵已经被那座花园占据了。
    我们希望人们的生活丰富多采，提倡人们有多种爱好。养鱼、种花、打猎、打球、欣赏音乐、上剧院……，都可以。只是有一个条件，就是必须把党和政府委托的工作放在第一位，自己的爱好放在第二位。绝不允许因个人爱好而妨碍工作。像朱政委那样爱了花园而忘了车间，给扣个“生活腐化”的帽子可能过分了点，但说他不务正业是不会冤枉他的。
