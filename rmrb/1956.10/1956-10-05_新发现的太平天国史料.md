Newly Discovered Historical Materials on the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom

    In recent years, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Historical Materials Compilation Committee has collected more than 24,000 volumes of historical materials related to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom from millions of volumes of books in several major libraries in Jiangsu. More than six million words have been copied and compiled into volumes.

    Among the more than 24,000 volumes of historical materials collected, there are hundreds of precious manuscripts and transcriptions. Many historical materials have never been seen before and are of great value for studying the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. For example, Chen Zuolin's diary manuscript, "Keyuan Beiwanglu" (可园备忘录, "Memorandum of Keyuan"), records the situation in Tianjing (Nanjing) at that time. Wang Zheng, a confidential staff member of Sai Shang'a, a Qing Dynasty imperial envoy, wrote a secret letter to a person surnamed Tang, which was more than 6,000 words long, exposing the inside story of the Qing army's failure in Guangxi and Hunan, and also recorded the rise of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom during this period. Among the historical materials, there are also 77 volumes of original letters written to Zeng Guofan by people at the time, exposing how the Qing Dynasty rulers dealt with the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. "Geng Gui Ji Lue" (庚癸纪略, "Record of Geng and Gui Years") by Juanpu Laoren (倦圃老人, "Old Man of Weary Garden") records the "field deeds" issued by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom to tenant farmers, which is also very important.

    The more than six million words compiled into volumes from the more than 24,000 volumes of historical materials collected include four compilations of Taiping Heavenly Kingdom historical materials in 64 volumes, as well as 35 volumes of local chronicles from the eighteen provinces through which the Taiping army passed. These are the result of the hard work of the staff of the Historical Materials Compilation Committee. For example, Shen Zi's "Bi Kou Riji" (避寇日记, "Diary of Avoiding Bandits"), with a full text of 200,000 words, is a precious historical material recording the construction situation of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in Jiaxing. The original manuscript of this diary is all in tiny characters, with many revisions. The diary is written on pieces of paper of different sizes, and the order of the years is reversed. The paper is a century old and has been riddled with many small holes by insects. However, the staff of the Historical Materials Compilation Committee carefully sorted out every scrap of paper in the original manuscript, and verified the year, month, and day of the diary according to the historical events, and then copied it into volumes.

    新发现的太平天国史料
    太平天国史料编纂委员会，几年来在江苏的几个大藏书库里，从百万卷图书中搜集到有关太平天国的史料两万四千多册，经抄录和编纂成册的已有六百余万字。
    搜集到的两万四千多册史料中，有珍贵的稿本、钞本上百册。很多史料是过去从来没有见过的，对研究太平天国史极有价值。其中如陈作霖的日记手稿“可园备忘录”，记录了当时天京的情况。清朝钦差大臣赛尚阿的机要幕僚王拯写给一个姓唐的一封长达六千余字的密信，暴露了清朝军队在广西、湖南失败的内幕，也记载了这一时期太平天国兴起的情况。史料中还有七十七册是当时人写给曾国藩的信札的原件，暴露了清朝统治者对付太平天国的情况。倦圃老人的
  “庚癸纪略”记载了太平天国发给佃农“田凭”的事，也很重要。
    在搜集到的两万四千多册史料编纂成册的六百余万字中，包括了太平天国史料四编六十四册，以及太平军经过的十八个省份的地方志三十五册。这些都是史料编纂委员会的工作人员辛勤劳动的结晶。例如，沈梓的“避寇日记”，全文达二十万字，是记载太平天国在嘉兴建设情形的一部珍贵史料。这部日记的原稿，都是蝇头小字，涂改甚多。日记写在纸片上，纸片大小不一，年代次序颠倒。纸片距今已有百年，被虫蛀成很多小洞。但是，史料编纂委员会的工作人员对原稿中的片纸只字都小心翼翼地加以整理，并根据史事的先后，考证了日记的年月日，而后抄录成册。（季）
