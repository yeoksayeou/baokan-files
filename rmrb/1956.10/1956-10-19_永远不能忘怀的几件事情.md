Several Things I Can Never Forget
    He Jiahuai
    Due to the severity of the White Terror and some other reasons, I never had the opportunity to meet Mr. Lu Xun during the entire period of the "Left League," which is truly a lifelong regret for me.

    However, there are three things related to Mr. Lu Xun that I can never forget, and that will forever encourage and鞭策 me forward.

    In the second half of 1932, the Kuomintang Shanghai Municipal Government and the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters conspired to arrest a large number of students, putting all the more progressive college and middle school students in Shanghai on a blacklist, attempting to conduct a comprehensive search and arrest, and wipe them out in one fell swoop. At that time, I did not know Mr. Lu Xun, nor had I ever corresponded with him, but Mr. Lu Xun, through Mr. Zhao Jiabi, the editor of Liangyou Book Company (because I had published a collection of short stories at Liangyou, so I knew Mr. Zhao), notified me to move into the Shanghai concession as soon as possible, which is how I escaped falling into the hands of Kuomintang agents. Mr. Lu Xun's love for young people is evident from this.

    Before joining the "Left League," I had written some naive novels and essays. After joining the "Left League," while doing other work, although I still practiced writing, I wrote too little and not well enough. At this time, I still hadn't met Mr. Lu Xun, nor had I ever corresponded with him, but he had mentioned me more than once, and had said something like this: "Having joined the 'Left League,' he should write more and better. If he continues like this, not to mention becoming a left-wing writer, I'm afraid he won't even be able to become a writer..." Obviously, Mr. Lu Xun meant that he was worried I would become a signboard-hanging, empty "left-wing writer"; he was always very dissatisfied with being "left but not writing." After hearing this warning, although I felt ashamed and grateful, I never strictly demanded myself to write something good, and I really failed Mr. Lu Xun's expectations.

    When Mr. Lu Xun passed away, I was just recovering from a serious illness and even had difficulty walking, but like other young people who loved Mr. Lu Xun, I lingered near the International Funeral Parlor all day, and often went inside to pay my respects to Mr. Lu Xun's remains. At the funeral, I also followed the thousands of mourners, holding up elegiac couplets, portraits, and wreaths, and escorted Mr. Lu Xun's remains to the International Cemetery (at Hongqiao Airport), far away from Shanghai. After watching Mr. Lu Xun's remains being buried, I walked back to Shanghai with several comrades in the rainy dusk. That day, the concession authorities were under martial law (ostensibly "monitoring"), and we could see fully armed police and motorcycles all the way. Kuomintang agents and the police station's undercover agents were also everywhere. However, the mourners did not pay any attention to them at all, and everyone was immersed in grief and anger; that mighty funeral procession was in fact a great demonstration against imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries.

    The above three things happened at least twenty years ago, but in my memory, they are still so fresh and so vivid, as if they happened only yesterday; even in the future, they will forever be unforgettable, and will forever encourage and 鞭策 me forward.

    永远不能忘怀的几件事情
    何家槐
    由于白色恐怖的严重和其他的一些原因，我在“左联”的整个时期，竟没有机会和鲁迅先生见过一面，这实在是我的一个终身遗憾。
    但是，有三件和鲁迅先生有关的事情，却使我永远不能忘怀，永远鼓舞着、鞭策着我前进。
    1932年下半年，国民党上海市政府和上海市党部阴谋大批逮捕学生，把当时上海所有较进步的大、中学生都列入黑名单，企图全面搜捕，一网打尽。当时我和鲁迅先生并不认识，也从未通过信，但鲁迅先生却经过良友图书公司编辑赵家璧先生（因为我曾在良友出过一本短篇小说集，所以和赵先生认识）通知我赶快搬入上海租界，这样我才幸免落入国民党特务之手。鲁迅先生的热爱青年，于此可知。
    在加入“左联”之前，我曾经写过一些幼稚的小说和散文。在加入“左联”以后，我在做其他工作以外，虽然也还是练习写作，先后写了一些东西，但写得太少，也写得不好。这时我仍然没有见过鲁迅先生，也没有和他通过一次信，可是他却曾经不止一次地提到我，并且说过这样的话：“进了‘左联’，应该写得更多、更好，像他这样下去，不要说左翼作家，怕连作家也当不成……”很明显，先生的意思是担心我会变成一个挂招牌的、空头的“左翼作家”；“左而不作”，他一向是非常不满的。我听到了这种警告以后，虽然觉得很惭愧、感激，但始终没有严格地要求自己，好好地写一些东西，实在是辜负了先生的期望。
    鲁迅先生逝世的时候，我正大病初愈，连走路也很困难，但我也和其他热爱鲁迅先生的青年一样，整天都在万国殡仪馆附近徘徊，并且不时地进去瞻仰先生的遗容。在出殡时，我也跟着成千上万的、高举着挽联、遗像、花圈的送葬者把先生遗体送到离上海很远的万国公墓（在虹桥飞机场）去，在看着先生的遗体安葬了以后，才和几个同志在阴雨的黄昏中徒步走回上海。那天租界当局是戒严（名义上说是“监视”）的，我们一路都可以看到全副武装的巡捕和摩托车，国民党的特务和巡捕房的暗探也布满各处，可是，送葬的人们却根本没有把他们看在眼里，大家都沉浸在悲痛而且愤怒的心情中；那浩浩荡荡的送葬行列，事实上是对于帝国主义和国民党反动派的一个大示威。
    以上三件事情，离开现在至少也已经二十年了，但在我的记忆里，却始终是这么新鲜，这么生动，仿佛还是昨天才发生似的；即在今后，它们也将永远地使我不能忘怀，永远地鼓舞我、鞭策我前进。
