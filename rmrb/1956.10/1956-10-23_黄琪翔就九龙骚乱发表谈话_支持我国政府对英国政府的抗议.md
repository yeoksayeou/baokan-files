Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd—Huang Qixiang, Secretary-General of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, issued a statement regarding the Kowloon riots.

Huang Qixiang said that the Kowloon riots have caused huge losses of life and property to the Chinese people. Our government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a stern protest with the British government, which is completely reasonable and legal. Just as the people of our country were awaiting a wise response from the British government, the British government stubbornly and unreasonably rejected our protest, sophistically describing the incident as a struggle between two factions of Chinese people, and slanderously claiming that our government wanted to use this incident to create political capital.

Huang Qixiang also said, "As everyone knows, our government's general policy in handling international affairs is peaceful coexistence. We have no need to create riots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, as everyone understands. On the contrary, since the mainland's liberation and the escape of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to Taiwan, they have used Hong Kong as a base for sabotage, committing murder and arson, and doing everything evil. What has drawn the most condemnation from fair-minded people around the world is the internationally unprecedented, heinous, and malicious plot to murder people on the "Kashmir Princess" plane on April 11 last year. Now, with the old scores unsettled, this Kowloon riot has occurred again. The British government not only does not condemn itself and admit its mistakes, but instead distorts the facts in an attempt to shirk responsibility, which is not allowed; openly insulting our government is even more intolerable. We fully support our government's continued strong protest, and we will not give up until we receive a satisfactory response.

Huang Qixiang concluded by saying, "If the British government does not face up to this extremely serious issue, if the British government cannot guarantee the lives and property of the Chinese people, then the Chinese people will know how to protect themselves."

### 黄琪翔就九龙骚乱发表谈话  支持我国政府对英国政府的抗议

    黄琪翔就九龙骚乱发表谈话
    支持我国政府对英国政府的抗议
    新华社22日讯　中国农工民主党秘书长黄琪翔对九龙暴乱事件发表谈话。
    黄琪翔说，九龙暴乱事件，使中国人民受到了巨大的生命和财产损失。我政府外交部对英国政府提出了严正的抗议，这完全是合理的，合法的。正当我全国人民等待着英国政府明智的答复的时候，英国政府竟横蛮无理的拒绝我国的抗议，强词夺理，把这个事件描写成为什么两派华人的斗争，并且含血喷人，说我政府想借口这次事件，制造政治资本。
    黄琪翔又说，大家知道，我国政府处理国际事务的总方针是和平共处。我们没有任何必要在港九制造骚乱，这是谁都懂得的。相反的，自从大陆解放，蒋介石集团逃到台湾以后，他们利用香港作为捣乱的根据地，杀人放火，无所不为。最引起全世界公正人士指责的，就是去年4月11日的“克什米尔公主”号飞机的国际上空前丑恶毒辣的阴谋杀害案件。现在旧账未清，又发生这次九龙暴乱，英国政府对此竟不自谴责认错，反而歪曲事实，企图推卸责任，这是不许可的；公然侮辱我国政府，更是不能容忍的。我们完全支持我国政府的继续强硬抗议，不得到满意的答复，决不罢休。
    黄琪翔最后说，如果英国政府不正视这个异常严重的问题，如果英国政府不能保障中国人民的生命财产，那末，中国人民会知道怎样来保护自己。
