Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 15th – The Tianjin Heavy Industry Bureau and the First Light Industry Bureau, which have already exceeded their 1957 production value targets by one year and three months, have seen significant changes in the landscape of their affiliated factories and enterprises during the First Five-Year Plan period.

The output of these factories and enterprises has grown significantly during the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan. In 1950, the Tianjin Electrolytic Copper Plant was still a copper smelting workshop using relatively simple operating methods. After years of continuous improvement of production equipment and technical conditions, it has adopted a more advanced electrolytic production method. The factory's annual output has now reached more than thirteen times that of 1950. The joint state-private Da Ming Steel Rolling Mill has continuously improved and added equipment, maximizing the potential of existing equipment. This year's output will increase more than eleven times compared to 1952. Furthermore, it has developed from only being able to roll large-sized round steel and ribbed steel to being able to roll Class A steel. The products of the Iron and Steel Industry Company and the Hardware and Wire Industry Company under the Heavy Industry Bureau have supplied the needs of industrial production and construction projects in many provinces and cities across the country.

The new products produced by these factories and enterprises are also constantly increasing. From January to August this year, enterprises under the Tianjin First Light Industry Bureau have successfully trial-produced a total of 528 new products, including cellophane, catgut, and lightweight insulated shoes, with 241 new products already put into production. Since the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, factories under the Tianjin Heavy Industry Bureau have successfully trial-produced nearly a hundred new types of products, including polyvinyl chloride paint cloth, alkaline steel ingots, lithopone, and superphosphate. Due to improved quality, many products not only meet domestic needs but are also being exported successively.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 15th – Some Tianjin factories that could only produce ordinary machines and parts and accessories are being transformed into factories that produce precision and larger-scale mechanical equipment.

The Tianjin Ship Repair and Building Factory has been transformed from a machine factory that could only repair small ships and cast iron pipes into a factory capable of manufacturing ships. Recently, the factory successfully trial-produced an 80-horsepower jet-propelled shallow-water tugboat, which can tow two 100-ton wooden cargo ships when navigating in shallow water. The factory types of the Tianjin Forging Press Machine Tool Factory and the Tianjin Machine Tool Factory are also changing. The Tianjin Machine Tool Factory was originally a factory undertaking various parts, accessories, and machine repairs. After reconstruction of the tool, assembly, and paint workshops, and the semi-finished product warehouse, the labor organization was adjusted, and it has become a factory capable of producing precision machine tools. Currently, the trial production of the C1615 lathe has been basically completed. The Tianjin Forging Press Machine Tool Factory was originally an ordinary machine factory producing products such as water pumps and cotton ginning machines. After expansion and reconstruction, it can become a factory specializing in the manufacture of medium-sized forging equipment. Currently, the factory has trial-produced 300 kg and 400 kg air hammers, and 200-ton and 300-ton liquid pressure presses. After adding some machine tools, lathes, planers, and grinders, the Tianjin Lifting Machinery Factory is now able to produce bridge cranes in large quantities.

    天津工业面貌改变很大
    新产品不断增加，许多修理厂变成制造厂
    新华社天津15日电　已经提前一年零三个多月达到了1957年生产总值水平的天津市重工业局和第一轻工业局，所属工厂企业的面貌在第一个五年计划期间发生了很大变化。
    这些工厂企业在执行第一个五年计划中产量增长很多。天津市电解铜厂在1950年还是一个用比较简单的操作方法进行生产的化铜车间，经过几年来不断的改进生产设备和技术条件，采用了比较先进的电解法生产，现在这个工厂的年产量已经达到1950年的十三倍多。公私合营大明轧钢厂经过不断改进和增添设备，发挥原有设备潜力，今年的产量将比1952年增加十一倍多，而且由过去只能轧制一些大规格的元钢和竹节钢，发展到能轧制甲类钢材。重工业局所属的钢铁工业公司和五金线材工业公司的产品，已经供应了全国许多省市的工业生产和建筑工程的需要。
    这些工厂企业生产的新产品也在不断增加。天津市第一轻工业局所属企业，今年1月到8月共试制成功了玻璃纸、羊肠线、轻便绝缘鞋等五百二十八种新产品，有二百四十一种新产品已经投入了生产。天津市重工业局所属各厂在执行第一个五年计划以来，共试制成功了近百种新种类产品，其中有聚氯乙烯漆布、碱性钢锭、立德粉、过磷酸钙等。不少产品由于质量提高，不但满足了国内需要，还陆续出口。
    新华社天津15日电　天津市一些原来只能生产普通机器和零件、配件的工厂，正在改造成为生产精密的和较大型的机械装备的工厂。
    天津市船舶修造厂已经由原来只能修理小型船舶和铸生铁管的机器厂，改造成为一个能制造船舶的工厂。最近这个厂试制成功了一艘八十马力喷水式浅水拖轮，它在浅水中航行能够拖带两艘一百吨的木货船。天津市锻压机床厂和天津市机床厂的工厂类型也在改变。天津市机床厂原来是承揽各种零件、配件和机器的工厂。这个厂的工具、装配、油漆等车间和半成品库经过改建以后，调整了劳动组织，已成为能够生产精密机床的工厂。现在，这个厂的一六一五车床试制工作已经基本完成。天津市锻压机床厂原来是做水泵、脱绒机等产品的普通机器厂，扩建改造以后，就可以成为专门制造中型锻压设备的工厂。现在，这个工厂已经试制三百公斤和四百公斤的空气锤、二百公吨和三百公吨的液体压力机。天津市起重机械厂增添一部分工作母机、车床、刨床、磨床后，已能大批生产桥式起重机。
