    The Reasons for Buying Cheap and Selling Dear
    By our reporters Yu Ming and Wu Rongjiang
    Recently, we visited Guozhuang, the famous concentrated production area of ​​Dangshan pears in Anhui. Dangshan pears are as sweet as honey, fleshy and crisp, truly living up to their reputation. The purchase price of Dangshan pears in Guozhuang is one jiao per jin, which is really too cheap compared with the price of Dangshan pears we ate in Hefei, Nanjing, and Shanghai (two jiao five fen to three jiao four fen per jin).
    Why is there such a big difference between the prices in the producing area and the selling area? This question aroused our attention. It turns out that Dangshan pears are uniformly purchased by the local grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives. The so-called "purchase" means that the grassroots cooperatives send a few staff members to guide the farmers in packaging, and then supervise the farmers to use their own ox carts to deliver the pears to the county supply and marketing cooperative. These "purchases" of the grassroots cooperative, which do not cost much, require a 4% handling fee based on the purchase price (according to comrades from the provincial supply and marketing cooperative, the general grassroots cooperative charges 6% of handling fees, of which 1% is turned over to the provincial supply and marketing cooperative as organizational fees). How much is this money? According to comrades from the grassroots cooperative, they obtained more than two thousand four hundred yuan in handling fees for purchasing six hundred thousand jin of pears in half a month. The cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative believe that collecting so many handling fees is justified, because this is a rare source of income throughout the year. In the past, when cotton was purchased by the supply and marketing cooperative, they could get income from the purchase of cotton. Now that cotton is purchased by the purchasing department, they have to collect more fees on the purchase of pears.
    When Dangshan pears are transported to the county supply and marketing cooperative, the county cooperative sells them to the wholesale departments from various cities that come to buy pears at one jiao five fen eight li per jin. This includes loss fees, administrative management fees, and profits. That is to say, the pears have not left the county, only about twenty li away from the producing area (still transported by agricultural cooperative ox carts), and after passing through the two hands of the supply and marketing cooperative, the price has increased by more than 50%. The transportation, handling, and storage fees for wholesale organizations in various cities to transport the pears to various cities are generally about one fen per jin of pears. However, the retail price of pears at the sales location is more than two jiao to three jiao, or even more than three jiao. This is because urban wholesale organizations and retailers also have to collect a lot of fees. Taking the wholesale organization in Hefei as an example, they charge 15% of the increased wholesale price as loss fees, 3% as operating management fees, and 3% as profits. When it comes to the retailer, they certainly cannot provide services for free, so they add another layer of profit. This is the reason for buying cheap and selling dear.
    It is understood that the current system of supply and marketing cooperatives is that each level is responsible for its own profits and losses and must also turn over profits. This method can of course encourage business initiative, but each level of the supply and marketing cooperative cannot help but constantly consider its own income, because if the income is too low, it will be difficult to maintain the lives of the staff, and it will be even more difficult to turn over profits. The purchase of Dangshan pears, where each level has to get involved and take a little profit, is inseparable from this system of the supply and marketing cooperative. As for whether other wholesale and retail units are obtaining excessive profits, it is also worth studying.

    贱买贵卖的原由
    本报记者　于明　吴荣江
    最近，我们访问了有名的安徽砀山梨集中产地——郭庄。砀山梨甜如蜜，肉多而脆，确实名不虚传。郭庄每斤砀山梨的收购价是一角钱，这和我们在合肥、南京、上海吃到的砀山梨价相比（每斤二角五分至三角四分），实在是太便宜了。
    产地和销地的价格为什么差这么多？这个问题引起了我们的注意。原来砀山梨统一由当地基层供销社收购。所谓“收购”，在基层社来说就是派几个工作人员指导农民包装，然后监督农民用自己的牛车送到县供销社。基层社的这些不花什么成本的“收购”却要按照收购价格，收取4％的手续费（据省供销社同志谈，一般基层社要收6％的手续费，其中1％作为省供销社的组织费上缴）。这笔钱是多少？据基层社的同志谈，他们半个月内收购的六十万斤梨，得到手续费二千四百多元。收取这么多手续费，在供销社的干部来说是有根据的，因为这是一年里少有的收入。过去棉花归供销社收购时，他们可以从收购棉花中得到收入，现在棉花归采购部门收，就只好在收购梨上多收点费用了。
    砀山梨运到了县供销社，县社就以每斤一角五分八厘，卖给各城市来买梨的批发部门，这里面包括损耗费，行政管理费和利润，就是说，梨没有出县，只离产地不过二十里地（还是农业社牛车送的），经过供销社的两道手，价格增加了50％多。各城市批发机构把梨运到各城市的运价、搬运费、保管费，一般是每斤梨一分钱左右。但到销地，梨的零售价却是二角多到三角，甚至三角以上了。这是因为城市批发机构和零售商还要收很多费用哩，以合肥的批发机构说，他们是按自己又提高了的批发价格收15％的损耗费，收3％的经营管理费，还收3％的利润。到零售商手里，当然不能白服务，于是再加一层利润。这就是贱买贵卖的原由。
    据了解：供销合作社现行的制度是各层自负盈亏，还得上缴利润。这个办法，当然能鼓励经营积极性，可是各层供销社，也就因此不能不经常考虑自己的收入，因为收入少了，工作人员的生活都难维持，上缴利润就更不容易。砀山梨的收购，每一层都要插只手，每一层都要从中取点利，和供销社的这种制度是分不开的。至于其他的批发和零售单位是否获得过高的利润，也还值得研究。
