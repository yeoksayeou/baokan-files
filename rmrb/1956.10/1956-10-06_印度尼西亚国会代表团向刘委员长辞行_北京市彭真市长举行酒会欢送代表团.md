Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The Indonesian Parliamentary Delegation, prior to their departure from Beijing to return home, bid farewell to Chairman Liu Shaoqi this afternoon.

Present at the farewell were Li Jishen, Shen Junru and Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Zhang Su and Xin Zhichao, Deputy Secretaries-General.

The hosts and guests engaged in a lengthy conversation, during which the head of the delegation, Kusnan, read out the delegation's statement following their visit to China.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th. Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen hosted a reception at noon today to bid farewell to the Indonesian Parliamentary Delegation visiting China.

Premier Zhou Enlai attended the reception. He said, "Thank you for coming to participate in our National Day celebrations, to visit our country, and to support us." He raised his glass and said in Indonesian: "Cheers to 'Merdeka' and to 'Pancasila'!" Premier Zhou also joined the Indonesian parliamentarians in shouting "Merdeka" five times.

Mayor Peng Zhen said in his speech at the reception that we have become like-minded, because our countries have both suffered oppression, and we must oppose colonialism, safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity, and maintain world peace.

Peng Zhen said that, as President Sukarno has said, the achievements of the Indonesian people are also the achievements of the Chinese people, and the victory of the Chinese people is also the victory of the Indonesian people. Egypt is fighting to safeguard its sovereignty over the Suez Canal. If the Arab people are victorious, our West will be secure. If Indonesia is prosperous and strong, our Southeast will be secure.

Mayor Peng raised his glass to wish Indonesia prosperity and strength, to wish unbreakable and eternal friendship between China and Indonesia, and to wish peace in Asia and the world.

Kusnan, the head of the Indonesian Parliamentary Delegation, gave a speech in reply and thanks. He said that the delegation will leave Beijing tomorrow to return home, and although our bodies are leaving, our spirit remains with you. He said that if China is prosperous and strong, Indonesia can rest easy.

Kusnan said that the Indonesian people are proud to have the Chinese people as friends. He said that the friendly unity between the two countries will last forever.

At the reception, Mayor Peng Zhen introduced the head and members of the Indonesian Parliamentary Delegation to the more than two hundred guests present. Among them were: Li Jishen, Li Weihan and Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Zhang Bojun, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Hu Yuzhi, Vice President of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association; Vice Mayors of Beijing; members of the Municipal People's Committee and the Municipal Political Consultative Conference; leaders of democratic parties and people's organizations in Beijing; presidents and professors of universities and colleges; and people from all walks of life.

Anwar Sani, Counselor of the Indonesian Embassy in China, was also invited to attend the reception.
