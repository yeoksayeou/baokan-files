    Fascist Persecution of Powell
    By Israel Epstein, correspondent in Beijing for the U.S. weekly "National Guardian"
    Not long ago, the U.S. government categorically forbade American journalists from reporting and visiting China. Among those banned were representatives of some of America’s most conservative newspapers. The State Department did not limit itself to issuing orders, but also used threats. It announced that anyone who violated the ban would be subject to heavy fines and years of imprisonment for "misuse of passports."
    At the same time, three American journalists who had stayed in China for many years and dared to tell the truth about China were virtually on trial. They are John William Powell, his wife Sylvia Campbell Powell, and their colleague Julian Schuman, all of whom worked together at the "China Weekly Review," formerly published in Shanghai. If convicted, Powell would face life imprisonment, and the other two would face ten years in prison, in addition to devastating financial penalties. The only "crime" of these defendants is that they truthfully reported what they saw and expressed their opinions on these facts. The indictment cannot show that they did anything more than this, but they have been charged with a very serious crime - sedition.
    The savage threats against those journalists who were banned from visiting New China, and the even more savage persecution of those who have seen New China and told the truth, are happening precisely at a time when the sinister smokescreen of the "Cold War" is gradually dissipating from international affairs and people's hearts. It is also happening at a time when rational analysis of world events and the deep desire of the vast majority of mankind are for the same need - mutual understanding, peaceful coexistence, equality and normal relations between countries and peoples with different social systems.
    What do these actions mean? It means that in Washington, the inventors and practitioners of the "Cold War" are struggling to protect their lucrative business. In this regard, they used two methods. One method is international conspiracy and propaganda, sometimes with blatant intimidation, and sometimes with equally blatant incitement. The other method is to try to intimidate and deceive the American people themselves, because their awakening will bring down the whole charade. Therefore, the planners of the "Cold War" will stop at nothing to prevent the American public from continuing to discuss the issues they are beginning to ask about; after the Geneva Conference and the Bandung Conference, these issues have begun to touch upon the main false arguments upon which American policy has been based for the past decade.
    This hysterical ban on news coverage and the trial of Powell are by no means accidental, because of all the fabrications about the "Cold War," the part about China is the easiest to expose. Denying the true nature of a revolution that has changed a quarter of humanity, refusing to recognize that a country with 600 million people is a factor in world affairs, is the most absurd. But it is very precious to the ruling group of politicians in Washington. From an international point of view, it gives them an excuse to maintain tensions in the Taiwan area for a long time, implement "embargoes," establish the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization," economically and militarily bind Japan, and continue to maintain divisive divisions in Korea and Vietnam that are prone to disputes. Domestically, it is a major factor in creating reasons for implementing economic militarization and stifling genuine public debate on foreign policy under the pretext of "war threats."
    There has been much criticism and ridicule abroad of Washington's out-of-step China policy. But this has not caused Washington much distress. A sarcastic saying has long been popular among Washington politicians: "Foreigners don't have the right to vote." What they fear most is domestic criticism, because once this criticism gains momentum, it will re-ignite a surge of surging currents under the surface of American life: the public's friendly sentiments towards China.
    However, despite the fact that the U.S. authorities have been slandering China for seven whole years, the American people have a long tradition of friendship with the Chinese people. Among Americans of all walks of life, in the hearts of Americans of all groups, there is a vivid memory. Progressives remember Agnes Smedley, a noble-minded female writer who lived among the Chinese people for many years and dedicated all her energy to explaining the truth of the Chinese revolution. Millions remember two heroic soldiers in the War of Resistance Against Japan, General Evans Carlson and General Joseph Stilwell. Carlson understood and admired the ranks of the Chinese people. After his retirement, he served as the first chairman of the post-war American Peace Movement Conference. General Stilwell's diary left behind after his death is nothing short of a severe indictment of Chiang Kai-shek. The entire people remember President Roosevelt, whose stance in building the anti-fascist alliance and opening up the road for international cooperation was completely different from the Cold War policies of his successors. In addition to political memories, there are economic motivations. Trade with China continues to be attractive - for workers, some important industrial sectors will reduce production and they will lose their jobs; and for manufacturers and traders, they also need more customers. All these undercurrents are strong, and will become stronger as the current world trends develop and as the government's orders to replace close contact with 600 million Chinese people with "friendship" with Chiang Kai-shek become increasingly bankrupt.
    In order to dispel this instinctive attitude of ordinary Americans towards China, the US government persecuted Smedley, Carlson and Stilwell until their deaths. For the same reason, the US government also vilified Roosevelt's Far East policy and any hint of sober assessment of China's reality by individual diplomats, soldiers and scholars (including some who were extremely conservative in domestic policy) as "treason" and ruthlessly drove these people out of public office and academic life. For the same reason, the US government even carried out endless propaganda to divert attention from some simple issues in the Geneva negotiations, forbade American journalists from visiting China, and launched a defamatory lawsuit against Powell and Schuman accusing them of "sedition"; only because they dared to expose the US government's behavior towards China, which violated every international standard, and dared to advocate establishing such a relationship with its neighbors across the Pacific, a relationship that 99% of ordinary Americans would demand once they knew the truth.
    What kind of people are these people who are accused of "sedition"? They are just ordinary Americans who have had the opportunity to see the facts not through the newspapers of monopoly capital, not through lying government statements, but through real life. All three of these people are representatives of the "Roosevelt era" - an era in which the United States had a certain degree of democratization in domestic politics and participated in the anti-fascist alliance in World War II - young people. None of them belong to the American left-wing movement. Powell's father edited the "China Weekly Review" in Shanghai for 20 years before his son inherited the business; Powell worked for the US wartime intelligence agency during the war. His wife Sylvia came to China as an employee of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Schuman was a young soldier who received the required Chinese language training to prepare for service in China, but he was demobilized because the war ended before he could go to China. He came to Shanghai as an American citizen and then served as a reporter for bourgeois newspapers and radio stations.
    As journalists, all three of them condemned Chiang Kai-shek's civil war policy and American interference. They did so not because they had left-leaning political views, but because, in their view, such things were tantamount to betraying the anti-fascist goals of World War II, for which American soldiers had fought side by side with soldiers from other countries. In this regard, they were not the only ones among the general American public in mid- and late-1940s. What Washington refused to forgive them for was that they did not abandon their views after China's liberation in 1949, and that when many others succumbed to pressure, they continued to repeatedly express such views throughout the Korean War and up to the present. By 1952, these arguments brought them into sincere agreement with the worldwide peace movement, and all three of them openly and frankly participated in the American delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference held in Beijing in October of that year.
    In 1953, after the widely respected and widely read "China Weekly Review" was banned from being sent to the United States, thereby losing its main readership, the newspaper decided to cease publication. Its editors returned to their home country despite attacks and intimidation from the US government and most of the US press. Powell described how American officials treated them before they even set foot on their own country. In an angry public statement, he said: "While I was still in Hong Kong, I was visited by our Central Intelligence Agency, who offered to reward me for any military intelligence I had... When I replied that I was mainly interested in general political, economic and social conditions, I was told that 'that's meaningless' and warned that it was my responsibility as an American citizen to pay attention to collect all militarily significant information when traveling abroad, whether in hostile, neutral, or even friendly countries." This is the most disgusting and ugly situation of cold war mentality! The only thing American officials are interested in is the intelligence that can help destroy other countries in times of war; as for the facts that can serve as the basis for realistic and normal relations between countries, they are "meaningless." Powell said that after he refuted this absurd proposal, he was warned that his life would be very difficult in the future; but if he could pretend to be friendly to China in the United States while conducting secret work on pro-China groups in the United States, then he could get rid of this predicament. This proposal was also rejected and boldly exposed.
    As a result, the predicted "difficulties" finally befell the Powell couple. They - the parents of two children - could not find a stable job and were often on the verge of starvation. They were dragged to Congress to be "investigated," during which all kinds of intimidation were used to damage their reputation. But the two of them and their colleagues continued to publish lectures and pamphlets advocating the establishment of Sino-US relations on the principle of "live and let live."
    In this regard, they fulfilled the duties of a patriotic American citizen based on their own understanding of the true interests of the United States, exercising the right to openly criticize and debate government policies guaranteed by the US Constitution and especially touted by US government spokespersons. But it seems that they took their rights too seriously. They were prosecuted for "sedition" simply for publicly expressing their honest views, and nothing else. This is a frame-up, it is brutal and fascist, and it is a destruction of freedom of the press and civil rights.
    We only need to look at the definition of "sedition" in American law to see that this is completely a frame-up. This charge only applies to one situation - obstructing military operations during wartime, inciting mutiny in the army, and hindering the replenishment of military personnel. However, as everyone remembers, President Truman described the United States' intervention in Korea as a "United Nations police action." He specifically pointed out that from a legal point of view, this was not a war, thus avoiding the requirement to obtain congressional approval before declaring war. If the intervention in Korea was legally a war, then Truman violated the law. If it was not legally a war, then Powell and anyone else could not commit "sedition" in this regard. The current indictment against Powell is distorting the facts to "determine" the issue according to its own convenience. The indictment says in retrospect that during the period from 1950 to 1953, the United States was at "war with the armed forces of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea...and...the Chinese Communist Party..." (What a strange war, the enemy in combat is not a country but only the army of one country and the political party of another country!)
    The prosecution is not only a frame-up, but it is also cruel, because the maximum penalty for each of the thirteen charges listed in the indictment is twenty years in prison and a fine of US$10,000. Therefore, Powell is accused of committing these thirteen crimes, and he must be sentenced to two hundred and sixty years in prison and a fine of US$130,000!
    These are fascist indictments, because they are blatant and shameless attacks on freedom of the press and freedom of public debate. The only "crime" charged in the indictment is thirteen passages in the "China Weekly Review". The indictment said that these words would "induce" a soldier who read them to evade military service (but the indictment did not mention that any active soldier had read them or been induced). Some of these articles only reported some news: the US's bacteriological warfare in Korea has been recorded by witnesses and international investigation teams, the US has delayed the ceasefire negotiations in Kaesong and Panmunjom, and the US's then-trend of expanding the Korean War to China. Other cited passages only expressed opinions, including - according to the indictment - "the Kuomintang (Chiang Kai-shek) regime is the US's stooge, is corrupt and should be condemned." This fair statement, of course, is not only the opinion of the vast majority of people and politicians in the world, but also, if judged by repeated opinion polls, is also the opinion of the vast majority of the American people.
    From this we can see another extremely important aspect of the Powell case. The American people are disgusted with McCarthyism and have rejected it, but the government is trying to use these unprecedented "sedition" charges to create a "legal" weapon to suppress all criticism - something that even McCarthy could only dream of. Since the adventure in Korea was legally declared a "war", the concept of sedition is involved; in this way, the same definition can be further applied to the "Cold War". In fact, one member of Congress has already made this suggestion, openly saying that for legal purposes, the "Cold War" should be considered to have started in October 1917!
    We can further point out that the Powell-Schuman indictment was filed more than three years after the last statement on which it was based was published - six years later than the indictment of others. The reason why their indictments were not filed earlier was not because the defendants were absent; the Powell couple had been in the United States as early as 1953. From this, we see a conspiracy to not only pave the way for persecution, but also to pave the way for belated persecutions against anyone who criticizes the country's foreign policy whenever politically necessary. It is no accident that this is happening at a time when the discussion of foreign policy is particularly important to American citizens.
    Finally, in the Powell case, the use of the excuse of "sedition" is another action by the American rulers to play with the American Constitution. They pretend to maintain the integrity of the Constitution, but in fact they are degrading it into a facade to cover up the fascism that is spreading everywhere. The Constitution is very definite about freedom of the press, so the indictment describes a case about freedom of the press as a case of "sedition". This is an old trick. The two sedition laws in American history were both issued during reactionary periods. The first was the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, which attempted to describe the entire Democratic Party at that time as spies of revolutionary France. It was repealed by the American people in 1800 - when Democratic leader Thomas Jefferson was elected president. The second was the Sedition Act of 1917, which targeted American patriots who wanted to keep their country out of the European imperialist war - among those victims was socialist leader Eugene V. Debs. After a long period of time, the American people's disgust prevented the citation of this law, but unfortunately this law was still allowed to remain in the code. The legal manipulators are precisely based on this law to prosecute the Powell couple and Schuman.
    It must be pointed out that in recent months, the actions of some courts and judges in the United States have begun to reflect that more and more social figures are aware of the attack on the Constitution and have begun to take some actions to defend the Constitution. The Supreme Court declared the sedition laws of individual states invalid, and specifically declared the indictment of Stawi Nelson, a leader of the working class and a communist, in Pennsylvania as invalid. After years of delay, the Supreme Court finally declared the states' self-proclaimed right to segregate blacks and whites in schools and public transportation illegal (this segregation made blacks rise up to fight for equal rights), thus truly defending the democracy of the Constitution for the first time. A federal court judge also rejected the indictment against Professor Owen Lattimore - a critic of Washington's Far East policy. But, in general, courts at all levels continue to undermine the Constitution in the guise of accomplices, and sometimes they are even accomplices of fascists (such as the recent new rulings against some branches of the Communist Party in New York State).
    Countless experiences have proven that every time the court is forced to respect civil rights, it is always because mobilized public opinion and outstanding legal defenses have found a way out in complex and expensive litigation procedures. In the Powell case, the courageous defendants, the maintainers of American freedom of the the press and the Sino-US normal relations, will wage a long and arduous struggle. This is a fierce struggle and an important struggle. It is related to both human freedom and world peace. It should receive the sympathy and support of the international press community and friends of freedom and peace around the world.

    对鲍惠尔的法西斯迫害
    美国“国民前卫”周刊驻北京记者　爱泼斯坦
    不久以前，美国政府断然禁止美国记者到中国作报道访问。在被禁止的人中有美国最保守的一些报纸的代表。国务院不只限于发布命令，而且还使用了威胁。它宣布说，任何人如果违反禁令，就要因“滥用护照”而被处以巨额罚款和数年的监禁。
    同时，曾在中国逗留多年，并敢于说出中国的实际情况的三位美国记者，实际上正在受审。他们是约翰·威廉·鲍惠尔，他的妻子锡尔维亚·坎贝尔·鲍惠尔和他们的同事朱利安·舒曼，他们都是在以前上海出版的“密勒氏评论报”共事的。如果被定罪，鲍惠尔就会受到终生监禁，其他两个人除了将被课以毁灭性的财政罚款以外，还会面临为期十年的监禁。这些被告的唯一“罪状”是，他们如实地报道了他们所看到的事实，并就这些事实发表了他们的意见。起诉书举不出来他们做了比这更多的事，但是他们却被加上一个极为严重的罪状——煽动叛乱罪。
    对那些被禁止访问新中国的记者的野蛮的威胁，以及对那些已看到新中国并说出真实情况的记者进行甚至更野蛮的迫害，这些恰好是发生在“冷战”的罪恶烟幕正在从国际事务和人们的心中逐渐消散的时候。这也是发生在对世界事件的理智分析和广大人类深心向往于同一的需要——不同社会制度的国家和人民之间的互相了解、和平相处、平等和正常关系的时候。
    这些行动是什么意思呢？这就是说在华盛顿，“冷战”的发明者和实行者正在挣扎着，企图保护他们的有利可图的生意经。在这方面他们使用了两个方法。一个方法就是国际阴谋和宣传，时而作粗暴的威吓，时而作同样粗暴的煽惑。另一个方法就是重新想恐吓和蒙蔽美国人民自己，因为他们底觉醒将会使这整个把戏全部垮台。于是“冷战”的策划者不惜任何代价来阻止美国公众去继续讨论那些他们正在开始过问的问题；在日内瓦会议和万隆会议之后，这些问题已开始接触到过去十年来美国政策所赖以建立的那些主要的虚伪论据。
    这个歇斯底里的新闻采访禁令和对鲍惠尔的审讯，绝不是偶然发生的，因为在所有关于“冷战”的捏造中，最容易被揭穿的部分是有关中国方面的。否认改变了四分之一人类的革命的真实性质，拒绝承认一个有六亿人口的国家是世界事务中的一个因素，乃是最荒诞不经的了。但是它对华盛顿的统治集团的政客们来说却是非常珍贵的。从国际方面说，它给他们以借口来在台湾地区长期维持紧张局势、实行“禁运”、建立“东南亚防务条约”组织、从经济上和军事上束缚日本、继续在朝鲜和越南维持容易引起纠纷的分裂。从国内来说，这是为实行经济军事化、假借“战争威胁”扼杀对外交政策的真正的公开辩论制造理由的一个重大因素。
    国外对华盛顿的步调紊乱的对华政策已有很多批评和嘲笑。但是这并没有使华盛顿感到很大的苦恼。在华盛顿的政客中间老早就流行着一句带嘲讽意味的话：“外国人没有投票权”。他们最害怕的是国内的批评，因为一旦这种批评得势，它就会在美国生活表面下重新掀起一股汹涌的激流：公众对中国友好的情绪。
    然而，尽管美国当局诽谤中国已经整七年，但是美国人民却有一个对中国人民友好的悠久传统。在各阶层的美国人中，在各个集团的美国人的心中，都有一种生动的记忆。进步分子记得，在中国人民当中生活过多年的思想崇高的女作家安格尼斯·史沫特莱，曾贡献她的全部精力来说明中国革命的真实情况。千百万人都记得，在抗日战争中的两个英勇军人伊文斯·卡尔逊将军和约瑟夫·史迪威将军。卡尔逊了解而且佩服中国人民的队伍，他在退休后，曾担任战后美国和平运动大会的第一任主席。史迪威将军死后留下的日记不啻是对蒋介石的一份严厉的起诉书。全体人民都记得罗斯福总统，他在建立反法西斯联盟和为国际合作开辟道路中所采取的立场同他的后继者的冷战政策截然不同。除了政治的回忆之外，还有经济的动力。同中国的贸易继续吸引人心——对工人说来，一些重要的工业部门减产，他们就要失业；而对制造商和贸易商说来，他们也需要更多的顾客。所有这些潜流都是强大的，而且将随着目前世界趋势的发展和以对蒋介石的“友谊”代替对六亿中国人民的亲近接触的政府命令的日益破产，而更形强大。
    美国政府为了驱除普通美国人对中国的这种本能的态度，曾对史沫特莱、卡尔逊和史迪威进行迫害，直至他们去世为止。为了同样的理由，美国政府还把罗斯福的远东政策以及个别外交人员、军人和学者（其中包括在国内政策上极端保守的一些人）对中国的现实的清醒估计的任何暗示都诬蔑为“叛国”，并且无情地把这些人从公职和学术生活中赶出去。为了同样的理由，美国政府甚至对日内瓦谈判中的一些简单问题，进行无休止的转移注意力的宣传，不许美国新闻记者访问中国，并对鲍惠尔和舒曼发动了一个控告他们犯了“煽动叛乱罪”的诽谤性的起诉书；而只是因为他们敢于揭穿美国政府破坏了每一项国际准则的对中国的行为，敢于倡议同太平洋彼岸的邻居建立这样一种关系，即当普通美国人知道了真相之后99％都会要求的一种关系。
    这些被控告犯了“煽动叛乱罪”的人究竟是些什么样的人呢？他们是一些不折不扣的普通美国人，他们有机会不是通过垄断资本的报刊、不是通过撒谎的政府声明，而是通过真实的生活来看事实。所有这三个人都是“罗斯福时代”——美国在国内政治方面出现一定程度的民主化、并参加了二次世界大战中反法西斯联盟的时代——的青年人的代表。他们中没有一个人属于美国左翼运动。鲍惠尔的父亲在儿子继承己业以前在上海主编“密勒氏评论报”二十年；鲍惠尔在战争时期，曾在美国的战时情报局工作。他的妻子锡尔维亚以联合国救济总署的职员的身份来到中国。舒曼是一个青年军人，他为了准备到中国服役，受过所需要的中国语文的训练，但是他复员了，因为战争在他能够到中国之前就结束了，他以一个美国公民的身份来到上海，其后并担任了资产阶级报刊和电台的记者。
    他们三个人作为新闻记者，谴责了蒋介石的内战政策和美国的干涉。他们之所以要这样做，并不是因为他们有左倾的政治观点，而是因为在他们看来，这类事等于是背叛了第二次世界大战的反法西斯的目标，为了这个目标，美国士兵曾和其他国家的士兵并肩作战。在这方面，他们在1940年年中和年底的一般美国人中不是仅有的。华盛顿之所以不肯原谅他们，是因为他们在1949年中国解放以后，仍不放弃他们的观点，而且当其他许多人屈服于压力之下的时候，他们却在整个朝鲜战争时期以及直到现在，仍继续一再发表这类观点。到1952年，这些论调使他们和全世界的和平运动达到真诚的意见一致，而且他们三个人都公开地、坦然地参加了美国代表团，出席了这年10月在北京举行的亚洲和太平洋区域和平会议。
    1953年，在广泛受到重视和广为阅读的“密勒士评论报”被禁止寄往美国、从而被迫失掉它的主要读者群众以后，这家报纸便决定停刊。它的编辑人员不顾美国政府和美国大多数报刊对他们的攻击和威吓，回到了他们的祖国。鲍惠尔曾描述了在他们还没有踏上自己的国土以前美国官员们就对他们作了怎样的款待。他在一个愤怒的公开声明中说：“当我还在香港的时候，我就被我国的中央情报局所访问，他们提出愿意为我所有的任何军事情报而酬偿我……当我回答我主要只对一般政治、经济和社会情况感兴趣的时候，我被告诉说‘那是没有意思的’，而且被警告说，在国外旅行的时候，无论是在敌对的、中立的、甚至是友好的国家里，注意搜集一切有军事意义的资料，是我作为一个美国公民的责任。”这就是冷战心理最令人作呕的丑恶情况！美国官员们所能唯一感兴趣的就是那些能帮助在战争时期毁灭其他国家的情报；至于那些可作为国家之间的现实的、正常关系的基础的事实，则“没有意思”。鲍惠尔说，当他反驳了这个荒谬绝伦的建议以后，他就受到警告说：今后他的生活将会非常困难；但是如果他在美国能装起一副对中国亲善的样子而同时对在美国的对中国友好的团体进行暗探工作，那么他就能摆脱这种困境。这个建议也受到了拒绝，并且被大胆地揭发了。
    其后果是，那个预告的“困难”终于降临到鲍惠尔夫妇的头上。他们——两个孩子的父母亲，找不到固定工作，并常常陷于断炊的境地。他们被拖到国会去受“调查”，在“调查”中，对他们施展了各种恐吓手段，破坏他们的名誉。但是他们两人和他们的同事继续在发表讲演和小册子，主张在“自己活也让人家活”的原则上建立中美关系。
    在这方面，他们根据自己对美国的真正利益的认识，尽了一个爱国的美国公民的职责，行使美国宪法所保证的、而又是美国政府发言人所特别爱吹嘘的公开批评和辩论政府政策的权利。但是看来，他们是过于认真看待自己的权利了。他们只是由于公开发表自己诚实的观点，此外别无其他，就被以“煽动叛乱罪”起诉。这是陷害，是残酷和法西斯化，是对新闻自由和公民权利的破坏。
    我们只要看一看美国法律中对“煽动叛乱罪”的定义就可以看出这完全是陷害。这个罪名只适用于一种情况——在战争时期妨害军事行动，在部队中煽动兵变，并妨碍军队人员的补充。但是，正如每个人所记得的，杜鲁门总统曾把美国对朝鲜的干涉说成是一种“联合国的警察行动”。他特别指出从法律的意义说来这并不是一场战争，这样就避开了必须取得国会的批准才能宣战的规定。如果对朝鲜的干涉在法律上是一场战争，那么杜鲁门就是违犯了法律。如果它在法律上不是一场战争，那么鲍惠尔和其他任何人就不能在这方面犯“煽动叛乱罪”。现在对鲍惠尔的起诉书是按照自己的方便去歪曲事实来“确定”问题的。这个起诉书以追溯的方式说，在1950年到1953年的时期内，美国同“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的军队……和……中国共产党……发生了战争。”（这是多么奇怪的一个战争，作战的敌人不是一个国家而仅是一个国家的军队和另一个国家的政党！）
    起诉不仅是一种陷害，同时它也是残酷的，因为起诉书里所罗列的十三条罪状，每一条的最重处刑都是二十年徒刑和一万美元的罚金。因此，鲍惠尔被控犯了这十三条罪，就得被处二百六十年徒刑和十三万美元罚金！
    这是法西斯化的起诉，因为它们是公然地和厚颜无耻地向新闻自由和公众辩论自由进攻。起诉书所起诉的唯一的“罪行”就是“密勒氏评论报”上的十三段文字。起诉书说这些文字会“诱使”一个读过它们的兵士逃避服役（但是起诉书里一点都没有提到有任何一个现役兵士读过它们或是被诱骗了）。在这些文章中有几段只是报道了一些新闻：美国在朝鲜进行的细菌战已为证人和国际调查团记录在案、美国拖延开城和板门店的停战谈判、当时美国想把朝鲜战争扩大到中国的趋势。其他被援引的一些段落只是表达了舆论，其中有——用起诉书的说法——“国民党（蒋介石）政权是美国的走狗，是腐化的和应受谴责的”。这一公正的立论，当然不单是全世界广大人民和政治家的意见，而且如果根据屡次民意测验来判断，也是广大美国人民的意见。
    由此我们可以看到鲍惠尔案件中的另一个极其重要的方面。美国人民对麦卡锡主义已厌恶透顶并已唾弃了它，但是政府却企图用这些前所未有的“煽动叛乱罪”来制造一件压制一切批评的“法律”武器——这是连麦卡锡也只能梦想的事。由于在朝鲜的冒险被合法地宣布为“战争”，于是牵涉到煽动叛乱的概念；这样，同样的定义也可以进一步用到“冷战”上去。事实上，已经有一名国会议员提出了这个建议，他公然说，为了法律的目的，应认为“冷战”始于1917年10月！
    我们可以进一步指出，对鲍惠尔—舒曼的起诉书，是在据以告发的最后一次言论发表之后的三年多才提出来的——比对其他人的起诉书晚了六年。对他们的起诉书所以没有早点提出来，并不是由于被告不在场；鲍惠尔夫妇早在1953年就在美国了。由此我们看到这样一种图谋，即不仅是要为进行迫害开辟道路，而且是要为每当政治上需要的时候就对任何批评国家的外交政策的人进行迟迟发动的迫害开辟道路。这件事正好发生在对美国公民说来外交政策的讨论特别至关紧要的时候，绝不是偶然的。
    最后，在鲍惠尔案件中用“煽动叛乱罪”的借口，是美国统治者玩弄美国宪法的又一行动，他们装作维护宪法的完整，而事实上却把它降贬成掩护遍地蔓延的法西斯主义的门面。宪法对新闻自由规定得很肯定，因此起诉书才把一个有关新闻自由的案件说成是“煽动叛乱罪”的案件。这是一个老把戏。美国历史上的两个煽动叛乱法都是在反动时期中发布的。第一个是1798年的外国人和煽动叛乱法，这个立法是企图把当时整个民主党说成是革命的法兰西的奸细，它在1800年被美国人民废除——当时民主党的领袖汤玛斯·杰弗逊当选为总统。第二个是1917年的煽动叛乱法，这个立法是针对那些要让祖国置身于欧洲帝国主义战争之外的美国爱国人士的——在那些受害者之中有社会主义的领袖犹金·符·道比斯。其后在一个长时期里，美国人民的厌恶制止了这个法案的引用，但是不幸的是这条立法仍然被容许留在法典中。玩弄法律之徒正是根据这个立法来起诉鲍惠尔夫妇和舒曼的。
    必须指出，近数月来，美国的一些法院和法官的行动已开始反映出：越来越多的社会人士警觉到对宪法的进攻，并开始采取一些行动来保卫宪法。最高法院宣布个别州的煽动判乱罪法无效，其中特别宣布了宾夕法尼亚州对工人阶级的领导者、共产党员斯塔维·纳尔逊的起诉书为无效。经过了多年的拖延之后，最高法院也终于把各州那种自认为具有在学校和公共交通事业中把黑人和白人实行隔离的权利宣布为非法（这种隔离使得黑人起来为平等权利而斗争），这样就第一次真正保卫了宪法的民主。一个联邦法院的法官还否决了对欧文·拉铁摩尔教授——一个对华盛顿远东政策的批评家——的起诉书。但是，总的说来，各级法院是以同谋者的姿态，继续破坏宪法，有时，它们甚至是法西斯分子的帮凶（例如最近对纽约州共产党的一些支部的新的判决）。
    无数经验证明，每次法院被迫尊重公民权利的时候，总是由于被动员起来的公共舆论和卓越的法律答辩在复杂的和费钱的诉讼程序中打出了一条出路。在鲍惠尔的案件中，勇敢的被告们，美国新闻自由和中美正常关系的维护者将要进行一个长期而艰苦的斗争。这是一场激烈的斗争，也是一场重要的斗争。它同人类自由和世界和平二者都有关系。它应当获得国际新闻界和世界各地自由和和平的友人的同情和支持。
