Xinjiang Yiganqi Reservoir Begins Discharging Water Ahead of Schedule

(Reported by our newspaper) The "Yiganqi Reservoir," the largest reservoir built with the assistance of the people in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, was completed nine months ahead of schedule on October 1st and began discharging water.

The Yiganqi Reservoir is located southeast of Shache County, on the north bank of the Yarkand River. It covers an area of ​​20 square kilometers. It has a storage capacity of 62 million cubic meters and can store water twice a year. It draws water from the Yarkand River to irrigate the fertile land of Makit County, a key cotton-growing county in the Autonomous Region. In the past, due to water shortages, the Uygur farmers here suffered from drought every year. The completion of this reservoir can not only solve the water shortage problem for more than 290,000 mu of land in the county, but also reclaim 100,000 to 200,000 mu of wasteland. The entire project of this reservoir includes the sixteen-kilometer-long Makit irrigation canal, the eight-kilometer-long earth dam with a height of two to six meters, the water intake gate and the reinforced concrete discharge gate. The total project cost is more than 1.3 million yuan, making it the cheapest and most effective reservoir in the Autonomous Region.

　　新疆衣干其水库提前放水
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区，民办公助的最大水库“衣干其水库”，提前九个月在10月1日竣工，开始放水。
    衣干其水库位于莎车县城东南，叶尔羌河北岸。面积有二十平方公里。蓄水六千二百万立方公尺，每年可蓄水两次。它引叶尔羌河水灌溉自治区重点植棉县——麦盖提县的肥沃土地。过去因为缺水，这里的维吾尔族农民年年遭受旱灾。这个水库修建完成，不仅可以解决全县二十九万多亩土地的缺水问题，并且还可开垦荒地十万至二十万亩。这个水库的整个工程包括十六公里长的麦盖提灌溉渠道，八公里多长二公尺至六公尺高的土坝进水闸和钢筋混凝土结构的放水闸。全部工程造价一百三十万多元，是目前自治区最便宜、效益最大的水库。
