Xinhua News Agency, October 1st, Blackpool dispatch: British Labour Party leader Hugh Gaitskell, in a speech to a mass rally in Blackpool on September 30th, on the eve of the opening of the Labour Party annual conference, demanded that the government guarantee that it would not use force on the Suez Canal issue without the consent of the United Nations.

	Gaitskell said that the British government led by Eden was like a "bus" driven by a "novice or drunk," and "the most recent and dangerous shock almost brought us to war over the Suez issue."

	Gaitskell also demanded that the government summon the exiled Cypriot Archbishop Makarios to London to negotiate the Cyprus issue. He said that the government should accept the ceasefire proposal recently put forward by Cypriot patriots and negotiate.

	Xinhua News Agency, September 30th, London dispatch: British Liberal Party leader Clement Davies, speaking at the Liberal Party annual conference held in Folkestone on September 29th, condemned the British government's position on Cyprus and the Suez Canal issue.

	Davies emphasized that allowing Cypriots independence is the only way to solve the Cyprus problem. He said that it is time to end the Cyprus tragedy. The government's policy on Cyprus has greatly damaged Britain's prestige in the eyes of all mankind.

	Davies also emphasized that on the Suez issue, "the British government undoubtedly made big mistakes," and these mistakes have caused concern not only in Britain but also around the world.

	At the same meeting, Davies announced his resignation as leader of the party. The seventy-two-year-old Davies stated: "The time has come to hand over the helm to a younger person."

	Xinhua News Agency, September 29th, TASS London dispatch: The Liberal Party delegate conference held in Folkestone on September 28th began discussions on the Suez issue. Many representatives criticized the British government's policy. In their speeches, they emphasized that the Suez issue should be resolved through consultation. Frost, a representative from Natford, said: "A provocative display of force has placed Britain in an unreasonable position."

	The conference passed an emergency resolution proposed by the party's executive committee, condemning the British government's attitude towards resolving the Suez issue.
