    The Secret of "Fine Wine"
    Under the leadership of Li Liangyan, deputy manager of the Zhaoqing Winery, which belongs to the Monopoly Enterprise Company of Gaoyao County, Guangdong Province, and under the direct control of resident factory representative Feng Mingxiang and salesman Hu Liang, a large number of various kinds of "fine wines" were produced. After touring around Yuezhong Huiyang and other places, these "fine wines" were successively returned to the Zhaoqing Winery to await disposal.

    Let's see how these "fine wines" are produced. For example, "Rose Liqueur" was originally made with roses, tuberose, and magnolia, plus rose essence which is suitable for beverages. This factory initially simply added a little rose essence to white wine and sold it as "Rose Wine." This was just a matter of not being fragrant and sweet enough. Later, because they couldn't buy rose essence, this factory used rose fragrance oil produced by Guangzhou Yonghua Factory to replace the rose essence. Rose fragrance oil is a cosmetic, not a beverage, and adding it to white wine not only makes it not fragrant, but also gives it a涩 (sè) astringent taste. The monopoly companies in Foshan, Huiyang, and other regions raised objections, and companies in Bao'an County and others even stopped selling it, but the factory continued to produce more than 33,000 bottles and a large vat (which can hold 1,000 bottles). Other wines such as "Three Snake Wine," "Hankou Fenjiu," and "Maoji Wine" are all made with substitutes in a chaotic manner, and the taste of the wine is not pure. A farmer in Gaoyao County was carrying urine to the field, and someone asked her what she was carrying. She said, "Zhaoqing Winery's Three Snake Wine." This is the evaluation of the masses.

    “美酒”的秘密
    广东省高要县专卖事业公司所属肇庆酒厂，在公司副经理李良炎的领导，驻厂员冯明祥、业务员胡亮等的直接掌握下，生产了大批各式各样的“美酒”。这些“美酒”在粤中惠阳等地周游一趟以后，又陆续回到肇庆酒厂听候处理了。
    请看这些“美酒”是怎样生产的。如“玫瑰露”酒，本来是用玫瑰花、夜兰花、白兰花加上可作饮料的玫瑰精制成的。这个厂起初简单地在白酒中加入少许玫瑰精就当“玫瑰酒”出售了。这还只是不够香、甜而已。后来，因为买不到玫瑰精，这个厂就用广州永华厂出产的玫瑰香油代替玫瑰精。玫瑰香油是化妆品而不是饮料，加在白酒里，不仅不香，而且有涩味。佛山、惠阳等地区的专卖公司提了意见，宝安县等公司甚至已经停止出售，而工厂仍继续生产了三万三千多瓶和一大缸（可装一千瓶）。其他如“三蛇酒”、“汉口汾酒”、“毛鸡酒”，都是这样乱用代用品滥造出来的，酒味都不纯。高要县有个农妇担尿下地，有人问她挑的什么，她说：“肇庆酒厂的三蛇酒。”这就是群众的评价。
