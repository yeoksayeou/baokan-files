    九龙两个木屋区发生两次大火灾
    新华社广州25日电　香港消息：九龙大坑西和花圩村两木屋区在22日下午先后发生两次大火。据24日香港文汇报报道已经向香港社会局登记的灾民有五百一十二户、二千四百三十九人；还有一小部分灾民陆续登记中。
    这两次大火是在22日下午由四时到九时左右不到五个钟头的时间内先后发生的。位于九龙仔大坑西西仁里的灾区是22日下午四时左右起火的，到六时左右才救熄。接着，和该处相距不远的花圩村在下午七时左右又告火警，幸好及时发觉扑救，没有成灾，但到九时左右又再次失火，便蔓延成灾。
    据两处的灾民说，当时由于火趁风势，因此火场蔓延很快，灾民因为逃命，所有家财衣物都赶不及抢救而遭受严重的损失。
    起火的原因还未查清。
