Xinhua News Agency report: Literary and art circles in the capital are launching activities to commemorate Lu Xun.

The China Federation of Literary and Art Circles is sponsoring a series of reports commemorating Lu Xun. Approximately 9,000 people have attended reports by Lu Xun's wife, Xu Guangping, and writers Huang Yaomian and Ba Ren, respectively, on "Lu Xun's Creative Life" and "The Development of Lu Xun's Literary and Artistic Thought."

Many writers in Beijing have published articles commemorating Lu Xun. Chen Yong's article, "Lu Xun's Struggle for Literary and Artistic Realism," published in the October issue of "People's Literature," provides a relatively detailed introduction to Lu Xun's brilliant struggle in the literary field to oppose bourgeois idealism and promote the tradition of realism. Cao Jinghua, Zang Kejia, He Jiahua, Li Jiye, and others have also published commemorative articles in newspapers and periodicals such as "China Youth" and "Literary Study."

The Beijing Lu Xun Museum Preparatory Office has received forty-nine works of art from artists commemorating Lu Xun. The woodcut works by printmakers Li Hua and Huang Yongyu, among others, are themed on Lu Xun's advocacy of woodcuts. The color woodcut illustrations created by Gu Yuan for Lu Xun's novels "Blessing" and "Hometown" depict the images of characters such as Xianglin's Wife and Runtu from Lu Xun's writings. Xiao Chuanjiu sculpted a "Bust of Lu Xun." Painters Wu Zuoren, Jiang Zhaohe, and others have also created colored ink paintings commemorating Lu Xun. These works will be displayed in the Beijing Lu Xun Museum.

Many publishing houses are successively publishing works introducing Lu Xun. The first volume of the China Youth Publishing House's "Selected Works of Lu Xun" has been published, including some of Lu Xun's novels, essays, and prose poems, and is accompanied by Feng Xuefeng's essay "Lu Xun's Literary Road." Books such as "Talking about Lu Xun with Young People," "A Collection of Essays on Lu Xun's Works," and "Analysis of 'A Call to Arms'" published by this publishing house are already on sale in bookstores. The People's Fine Arts Publishing House will also publish books such as "Lu Xun on Fine Arts" and "Lu Xun on Comic Strips." The long-awaited first and second volumes of "The Complete Works of Lu Xun" will also be published soon by the People's Literature Publishing House.

Colorful movie posters have appeared on the streets of Beijing, announcing the release dates of "Blessing" and "The Life of Lu Xun." The Beijing Experimental Drama Troupe will perform the drama "The True Story of Ah Q" starting from the 16th.

    首都文艺界展开纪念鲁迅活动
    据新华社讯　中国文学艺术界联合会正在主办纪念鲁迅的报告会。约有九千多群众分别听了鲁迅夫人许广平和文学家黄药眠、巴人所作的“鲁迅的创作生活”和“鲁迅文艺思想的发展”等报告。
    在北京的许多作家都发表了纪念鲁迅的文章。陈涌在“人民文学”十月号上发表的“为文学艺术的现实主义而斗争的鲁迅”一文，比较详细地介绍了鲁迅在文学领域内为反对资产阶级唯心主义和发扬现实主义传统而作的辉煌的斗争。曹靖华、臧克家、何家槐、李霁野等也都分别在“中国青年”“文艺学习”等报刊上发表了纪念的文章。
    北京鲁迅博物馆筹备处已经收到美术家们纪念鲁迅的作品四十九件。版画家李桦、黄永玉等的木刻作品，都以鲁迅倡导木刻为主题。古元为鲁迅小说“祝福”、“故乡”等所作的套色木刻插图，表现了鲁迅笔下祥林嫂、闰土等人物的形象。萧传玖雕塑了“鲁迅胸象”。画家吴作人、蒋兆和等也创作了纪念鲁迅的彩墨画。这些作品都将在北京鲁迅博物馆陈列出来。
    许多出版社正在陆续出版介绍鲁迅的著作。中国青年出版社的“鲁迅选集”第一卷已经出版，其中有鲁迅的一部分小说、散文和散文诗，并且附有冯雪峰的“鲁迅的文学道路”的论文。这个出版社出版的“跟青年谈鲁迅”、“鲁迅作品论集”、“‘呐喊’分析”等书已在书店出售。人民美术出版社也将出版“鲁迅论美术”“鲁迅论连环画”等书。读者盼望已久的“鲁迅全集”第一、二卷也即将由人民文学出版社出版。
    北京街头出现了彩色的电影海报——预告“祝福”“鲁迅生平”上映的日期。北京市实验话剧团将从16日起演出话剧“阿Q正传”。
