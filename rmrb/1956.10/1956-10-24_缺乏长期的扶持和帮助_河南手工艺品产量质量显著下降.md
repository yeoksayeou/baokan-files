Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 22nd: According to information gathered at a recent symposium of veteran artisans of arts and crafts held by the Henan Provincial Handicraft Bureau, among the twenty-seven major trades represented at the meeting, the quality of products in five categories has significantly declined, and eight categories have either ceased or are about to cease production; in addition, the quantity of products in four categories has fallen far short of previous levels.

Henan Province has a long history of handicrafts. Among them, Jun porcelain, which originated the earliest, has a history of nearly a thousand years. With its bright colors, it has long been popular in Japan, the United States, Britain, and other countries. The dotted tin teapots produced in Hua County keep the flavor of tea or wine unchanged for a long time. The famous Nanyang "branded chopsticks" made of holly wood and branded with various exquisite patterns, the Dushan jade carvings, and the Changge velvet are not only loved by the people of Henan but also sell well in major cities across the country.

Analyzing the reasons for the production slump in the eight products that have already ceased or are about to cease production, it is mostly because the state has implemented a system of unified purchase and sales of major materials without considering their special needs. The dotted tin teapots and Changge velvet have ceased production because the raw materials tin and wool are not included in the state plan and there is nowhere to purchase them. Nanyang jade carvings and branded chopsticks also suffer from a severe shortage of raw materials because agricultural cooperatives emphasize agriculture and neglect sideline production, and farmers no longer go to the mountains to mine jade or cut holly wood. Some are also caused by the lack of attention to purchase and sales by state-owned commercial departments.

Due to the long-term slump in production, many veteran artisans in various trades had already switched to other professions before liberation. In the famous Jun porcelain, imitation Tang porcelain, and jade carving industries, there are currently only one or two workers with truly skilled techniques. They are all around fifty years old and have not taken on any apprentices. If this continues, their skills will inevitably be lost.

The Henan Provincial Handicraft Bureau is now studying the matter with relevant departments and is preparing to take various measures to solve the current difficulties in production.

### 缺乏长期的扶持和帮助  河南手工艺品产量质量显著下降

    缺乏长期的扶持和帮助
    河南手工艺品产量质量显著下降
    新华社郑州22日电　根据河南省手工业管理局最近召开的工艺美术品老艺人座谈会上了解，在参加这次会议的二十七种主要行业中，现在已有五种产品质量显著下降，八种现在已经或者将要停止生产；另外有四种产品数量已经远远达不到过去的水平。
    河南省的这些手工艺品历史悠久，其中，创始较早的钧瓷，迄今已经将近一千年，它色彩鲜艳，很早就畅销日本和美、英等国。滑县出产的点锡壶，盛茶或酒，气味长期不变。用冬青木制成烙有各种精细花纹的著名的南阳“烙花筷子”、独山玉石雕刻和长葛绒等都不仅为河南广大人民所喜爱，并且畅销全国各大城市。
    仅就目前已经和将要停产的八种产品中分析，造成生产不振的原因，大都因为国家对一些主要物资实行了统购统销以后，没有照顾到它们的特殊需要。点锡壶和长葛绒就因所用原料锡和羊毛没有编入国家计划，无处购买原料而停产。南阳玉石雕刻和烙花筷子，也因为各农业社重视农业轻视副业生产，农民不再上山去挖玉石、砍冬青木，因而造成原料奇缺。还有些是由于国营商业部门对这方面的购销不够重视而引起的。
    由于生产上的长期不振，早在解放前许多行业的老艺人就已纷纷转业。著名的钧瓷、仿唐瓷和玉雕等行业目前真正具有熟练技术的工人只有一人到两人，他们的年纪都在五十岁上下，而且都没有收学徒，长此下去他们的技术必将失传。
    现在河南省手工业管理局正和有关部门研究，准备采取各种措施来解决当前生产上存在的困难。
