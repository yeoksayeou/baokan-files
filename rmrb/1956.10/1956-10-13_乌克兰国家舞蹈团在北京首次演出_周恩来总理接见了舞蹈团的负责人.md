Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The Soviet Ukrainian National Dance Ensemble gave its premiere performance at the Tianqiao Theater in Beijing tonight.

The first program performed tonight was the folk dance "Embroidered Girl," specially rehearsed for the Chinese audience, which depicts the birth of a magnificent tapestry. Pairs of actresses, dancing lightly and slowly, hold colorful woolen threads, interweaving various beautiful patterns, like bright flowers in this hypothetical tapestry. When the actors raised the "tapestry" embroidered with the six characters "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship" to conclude the dance, the audience erupted in thunderous applause.

The "Spring Suite," which was most popular during performances throughout China, and the humorous dance "The Jilted Lovers," were also warmly welcomed here tonight. The "Spring Suite," performed by all the members of the ensemble, describes the custom of students from Kiev, about to embark on life and a new school year, welcoming the sunrise on the banks of the Dnieper River and in the gardens. When the dancers, dressed in white and holding flowers, appeared on the stage, they gave the audience a feeling of vigor and vitality, expressing the scene of spring flowers in full bloom and the optimism and bright future of Soviet Ukrainian youth. The humorous dance "The Jilted Lovers" tells the story of a girl who rejects the pursuit of four boyfriends, giving her love to the lover she is waiting for. The excellent performance of the four dancers playing the jilted lovers repeatedly caused the audience to burst into laughter. This dance was re-performed twice at the audience's enthusiastic request.

The dancers also performed the folk dance "Gopak," which displays the Ukrainian dance's special skills such as spinning and jumping; the folk dances "Pheasant Dove," "Kazan Tatar Dance," and "Hutsul Dance," which depict the life and love of the Ukrainian people; and the "Tropotianka" dance, which is based on the unique movements such as the broken steps and shrugs of the dances of the Transcarpathian Oblast in western Ukraine. The audience repeatedly used rhythmic and enthusiastic applause to praise the artists' wonderful performances.

The Ukrainian dancers performed a total of fourteen dance programs and one folk music program tonight. The evening ended after the performance of the "Ukrainian Suite."

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Minister of Culture Xia Yan, Vice Mayor of Beijing Le Sōngshēng, Deputy Secretary-General of the Council of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Gē Bǎoquán, and Vice Chairman of the China Dance Art Research Association Dài Àilián all attended the performance tonight.

Soviet Ambassador to China Yudin also watched tonight's performance.

During the intermission, Premier Zhou Enlai met with the artistic director of the dance ensemble B. B. Virsky, the director V. A. Pishmenei, the chief conductor of the orchestra I. Ye. Ivashchenko, and the principal actors. After the performance, Premier Zhou Enlai and Ambassador Yudin went on stage to shake hands with the dance ensemble members and congratulate them. Beijing literary and art workers presented flower baskets to the dance ensemble. (Attached picture)

    乌克兰国家舞蹈团在北京首次演出
    周恩来总理接见了舞蹈团的负责人
    新华社12日讯　苏联乌克兰国家舞蹈团今天晚上在北京天桥剧场举行首次演出。
    今晚表演的第一个节目是专为中国观众排练的民间舞蹈“绣花姑娘”，它描绘了一幅华丽的壁毯的诞生。一对对轻步慢舞的女演员互相牵着五色的绒线，交织成各种美丽图案，她们好像这幅假设的壁毯中的鲜艳花朵。当演员高举着绣有“中苏友好万岁”六个大字的“壁毯”来结束这个舞蹈的时候，全场掌声雷动。
    在中国各地演出时最受欢迎的“春天组舞”和诙谐舞“失恋者”，今晚在这里也受到最热烈的欢迎。由全团演员表演的“春天组舞”，是描述即将走向生活和走向新学年的基辅学生到第聂伯河岸和花园迎接日出的习俗的。身穿白色服装和手执鲜花的舞蹈者出现在舞台上的时候，给观众以朝气蓬勃的感觉，他们表演出春花怒放的情景，表现了苏维埃乌克兰青年的乐观情绪和前途的光明。诙谐舞“失恋者”叙述一位姑娘拒绝了四个男朋友的追求，把爱情给予她等待着的爱人。四位扮演失恋者的舞蹈家的出色表演，不止一次地引起观众哄堂大笑。这个舞蹈在观众热烈要求下重演了两次。
    舞蹈家们今晚还表演了显示乌克兰舞蹈的旋转、跳跃等特技的民间舞蹈“哥巴克”；描写乌克兰人民生活和爱情的民间舞蹈“雉鸠”、“喀山鞑靼人舞”、“古楚尔人舞”；根据乌克兰西部外喀尔巴阡省舞蹈的碎步耸肩等特有的动作编成的“特罗波强卡”舞等。观众们一再用有节奏的热烈掌声来赞扬艺术家们的精彩表演。
    乌克兰舞蹈家们今晚共表演了十四个舞蹈节目和一个民间音乐节目。晚会在表演了“乌克兰组舞”以后结束。
    周恩来总理，文化部副部长夏衍，北京市副市长乐松生，中苏友好协会总会理事会副秘书长戈宝权，中国舞蹈艺术研究会副主席戴爱莲今晚都到场观看了演出。
    苏联驻中国大使尤金也观看了今晚的演出。
    周恩来总理在演出休息的时候接见了舞蹈团艺术指导巴·巴·维尔斯基，团长瓦·阿·彼什缅内，乐队总指挥伊·叶·伊瓦申科以及主要演员。演出结束以后，周恩来总理和尤金大使等上台同舞蹈团人员握手，向他们表示祝贺。北京文艺工作者向舞蹈团献了花篮。（附图片）
