Xinhua News Agency, October 28th, dispatch from TASS, Paris, October 27th: French Foreign Minister Pineau and West German Foreign Minister von Brentano signed a treaty in Luxembourg on October 27th regarding the political incorporation of the Saar into West Germany, effective January 1st, 1957. The treaty stipulates that the economic integration of the Saar into West Germany will be carried out gradually over the next three years, to be completed before December 31st, 1959.

The two sides also signed an agreement on the construction of the Moselle Canal, an agreement on the rights of residents, and an agreement on cultural cooperation between France and the Saar.

The treaty, signed by France and West Germany after lengthy negotiations, effectively ends the existing economic and customs union between France and the Saar. For many years, successive French governments have insisted on keeping the resources of the Saar, which was economically integrated into France after World War II, in French hands. According to the treaty, France will obtain 90 million tons of coal from the Saar over 25 years, whereas it currently possesses all the coal mining resources in the Saar (approximately 15 to 16 million tons of coal are mined annually in the Saar).

The Parisian press emphasizes that France has not only agreed to the political incorporation of the Saar into West Germany at a time when the West German ruling clique is accelerating militarization and establishing a new West German army with all its might, but has also agreed to a significant weakening of France's economic position. In exchange, West Germany has agreed to build the Moselle Canal, which is of concern to some French industrialists, but this may not compensate for France's losses.

    法国和西德签订萨尔条约
    西德同意修建摩塞尔运河交换法国在萨尔的利益
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社巴黎27日讯：法国外交部长比诺和西德外交部长勃伦塔诺27日在卢森堡签订了关于萨尔从1957年1月1日起在政治上并入西德的条约。条约规定，萨尔在经济上并入西德将在今后三年内逐步进行，而在1959年12月31日以前完成。
    双方同时还签订了关于修建摩塞尔运河的协定、关于居民权利的协定以及关于法国和萨尔之间的文化合作协定等。
    法国和西德经过长期谈判后所签订的条约，实际上结束了法国和萨尔现存的经济和关税同盟。许多年来，法国历届政府一直坚决主张在第二次世界大战以后在经济上并入法国的萨尔的资源保持在法国手里。根据条约，法国将在二十五年中从萨尔获得九千万吨煤，而目前它拥有萨尔的全部煤矿资源（在萨尔开采的煤一年大约是一千五百万到一千六百万吨）。
    巴黎的新闻界人士着重指出，法国不仅同意当西德统治集团正以全力加速军国主义化和建立新的西德军队的时候使萨尔在政治上并入西德，而且同意让法国的经济地位大大削弱。作为交换条件，西德同意修建法国某些工业人士所关心的摩塞尔运河，可是这未必能抵偿法国方面的损失。
