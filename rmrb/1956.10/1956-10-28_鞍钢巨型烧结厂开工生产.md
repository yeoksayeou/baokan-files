Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 26th. A newly built giant artificial rich ore plant—the new sintering plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, produced its first batch of sintered ore on the 25th.

    This sintering plant, which includes eleven workshops, officially started construction in November last year, and the first phase of the project has now been completed. In about half a year, when the entire artificial rich ore plant is put into production, its annual production of sintered ore will be enough to supply Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 7 blast furnace for more than forty months. Therefore, its early commissioning is of great significance to the rapid development of Anshan Iron and Steel's ironmaking industry.
    This factory was built with the latest designs and equipment supplied by the Soviet Union. The entire production process of the factory is mechanized and automated, and the labor productivity of workers will be more than 20% higher than that of the old sintering plant. The working conditions in this factory are also very good, and dust covers have been installed on the sintering machine and some belt conveyors. The factory also has water curtains, air showers, spraying equipment, and other facilities.

    鞍钢巨型烧结厂开工生产
    新华社鞍山26日电　鞍山钢铁公司新建的一座巨型人造富矿厂——新烧结厂，25日生产出了第一批烧结矿。
    这座包括有十一个车间的烧结厂，是在去年11月正式动工兴建的，现在第一期工程已经完工。再过半年左右的时间，这座人造富矿工厂全部投入生产后，它一年生产的烧结矿就可以供鞍钢七号高炉生产用四十多个月。因此，它的提前投入生产，对于鞍钢炼铁工业的迅速发展有重要意义。
    这座工厂是由苏联供应的最新设计和设备建设起来的。工厂的整个生产过程都是机械化自动化的，工人的劳动生产率将比旧烧结厂提高20％以上。这个工厂的劳动条件也很好，在烧结机和有些皮带运输机上，都安装了防尘罩。工厂还有水幕、空气沐浴、喷雾等设备。
