Xinhua News Agency, October 19th dispatch: According to TASS, Cairo, October 18th, Egyptian newspapers commenting on the communiqué issued after the British-French talks in Paris said that Britain and France have not abandoned their intention to force Egypt to accept those parts of their Suez Canal proposals that were rejected by the Security Council due to Soviet support.

	The well-known observer Anwar Sadat wrote in "The Republic" that Egypt has completely rejected and will continue to reject any suggestions for establishing international control of the Suez Canal.

	If Britain and France truly hope to peacefully resolve the Suez Canal issue on the basis of the agreed six principles, Egypt is prepared to welcome the steps they take in this regard. If they intend to engage in new conspiracies, then it can be said with confidence that Egypt has the ability to expose their conspiracies.

	"Al-Akhbar", "Al Gomhouria", "Cairo Daily News" and other newspapers also published similar opinions.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 19th: The Bombay "Times of India" wrote today: The sooner Western countries realize that the Dulles Plan is not the final decision on the Suez Canal issue, the brighter the prospects for a final solution to the issue.

	"Times of India" said: Recently, Cairo, along with France and Britain, accepted six basic principles that will guide the future management of the canal and reconcile the interests of canal users with Egyptian sovereignty. Although these principles are not "concrete proposals," they are, after all, a very clear statement of what can be hoped for regarding Egypt's attitude. As for the responsibility of turning these principles into concrete plans, the share that Western countries should bear should be no less than that of the Nasser government.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 19th: "Merdeka" said today that Eden's continued insistence on international control of the Suez Canal "is a violation of the Security Council resolution."

	The newspaper pointed out that the resolution passed by the Security Council clearly recognized Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal.

	The newspaper said that no country with self-respect would oppose Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal.

	The newspaper said that now is the time for Eden to acknowledge Egypt's correct step and reach an agreement with Egypt to ease international tensions.

    埃印等国报纸评苏伊士问题
    要英法放弃国际管制的阴谋
    据新华社19日讯　据塔斯社开罗18日讯：埃及报纸评论英法在巴黎会谈结束以后发表的公报说，英国和法国并没有放弃强迫埃及接受它们的关于苏伊士问题的提案中由于苏联的支持而被安全理事会否决的那一部分的意图。
    著名的观察家安瓦尔·萨达特在“共和国报”上写道，埃及已经完全拒绝了并且还会拒绝任何关于建立苏伊士运河国际管制的建议。
    如果英国和法国真正希望在大家同意的六项原则的基础上和平解决苏伊士问题的话，埃及准备欢迎它们在这方面所采取的步骤。如果它们打算搞新的阴谋诡计，那么可以自信地说，埃及有能力拆穿它们的阴谋诡计。
    “消息报”、“晚报”、“开罗报”和其他报纸也都发表了类似的意见。
    据新华社新德里19日电　孟买“印度时报”今天写道：西方国家愈早认识到杜勒斯计划并不是苏伊士运河问题上的最后决定，那么，求得问题最后解决的前途就愈光明。
    “印度时报”说：最近，开罗同法国和英国一起接受了六项基本原则，这些原则将指导将来的运河管理工作，并且使运河使用国的利益同埃及的主权调和起来。虽然这些原则不算是“具体的建议”，但是它们终究是关于埃及的态度所能希望的非常明确的说明了。至于把这些原则变成具体计划的责任，西方国家所应该担负的一部分即使不比纳赛尔政府大，也应当是一样大。”
    新华社雅加达19日电　“独立报”今天说，艾登仍然坚持对苏伊士运河实行国际管制的态度“是违反安全理事会的决议的”。
    这家报纸指出，安理会通过的决议明确地承认了埃及对苏伊士运河的主权。
    报纸说，任何一个有自尊心的国家都不会反对埃及把苏伊士运河收归国有。
    报纸说，现在是艾登承认埃及的这个正确步骤，同埃及达成协议以便缓和国际紧张局势的时候了。
