Speech by President Sukarno at the Joint Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of the CPPCC

Brothers and sisters, friends, comrades,

First of all, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the Government of the People's Republic of China for inviting me to visit your country as a state guest. At the same time, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all of you for inviting me to speak at this enlarged meeting. (Applause)

Here, I must also say again that you have praised and extolled me too much. I am not the creator of independence, nor am I the creator of the national movement that led to independence. The national movement is the result of an objective force aroused by imperialism. (Applause)

As I said to the students of Tsinghua University this morning, the independence movement in Egypt was not created by Gamiel or Nasser; the national movement in India was not created by Gandhi or Nehru; the national movement in the Philippines was not created by Rizal Imercado. In fact, the Chinese national movement was not created by Sun Yat-sen or Chairman Mao Zedong. Therefore, the Indonesian national movement was not created by Mohammad Hatta or Sukarno either. (Applause)

Mustafa Gamil, Nasser, Gandhi, Nehru, Rizal Imercado, Sun Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, Mohammad Hatta, Sukarno – these people are nothing more than the spokesmen of the oppressed people. The movement of the oppressed people, as I said above, is the result of an objective force aroused by imperialism. I said to the university students just now that after the commercial revolution in Western Europe, the Asian nations began to lose their political independence. Then came the industrial revolution in Western Europe, which gave rise to capitalism, and capitalism gave rise to imperialism. As a result, the Asian and African nations became increasingly unable to achieve independence, and they gradually lost their political independence, not to mention their economic independence.

The history of Asia and Africa in the second half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century is a history of poverty, a history of humiliation and oppression, a history of suffering, a history of loss of independence. Egypt, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, China, and other nations were reduced to poor nations, and they lost all the rights they should have as human beings. An impoverished nation like Indonesia can be called a "coolie" nation, and also a "coolie" for many nations. The Indonesian nation was so poor that the living expenses per person per day were only two and a half cents.

Action caused reaction, so it is not surprising that the nations of Asia and Africa would one day rise up, one day demand the restoration of independence, demand to live gloriously and freely again, demand to live the life that human beings should live, demand to re-establish a just and prosperous society, and demand to enjoy full rights. Therefore, national movements emerged in these nations. In the national movement, each nation has its own spokesman and representative. They are merely expressing the thoughts and feelings that have long been in the hearts of the people. If they do not cultivate and express the feelings, thoughts, and desires that are in the hearts of the people, then they will not be able to mobilize a single person. As I said at a banquet here, a leader who expresses something that is not already in the hearts of the people is like a general without troops shouting in the desert. (Applause)

As the philosopher Spencer said, all socialist and national movements against capitalism and imperialism are nothing more than the resistance aroused by the oppressed people, classes, or nations because of oppression. The national movements in Egypt, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, China, and other regions are, in fact, this kind of resistance aroused by oppression.

This resistance may seem like a passive resistance. However, every kind of resistance is actually a positive force. Because it stimulates all the positive forces in the human body, stimulates all the positive forces of the nation, and stimulates all the positive forces in society to build, and once again, to build. Yes, some destruction is necessary before construction, but the fundamental purpose is still construction—construction of independence, construction of the nation, construction of the country, construction of society. (Applause)

Reactionaries, conservatives, imperialists, and capitalists forget that there is a force for construction in the hearts of human beings, and forget that there is a force for construction in society. For example, they launch wars—World War I, World War II, or even earlier, the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. They forget that the constructive power of resistance caused by oppression exists, and forget that the result of war often produces something they did not expect. A philosopher said: "War is a strange alchemist." Yes, it is strange if judged by its results. (Applause) Yes, war is a strange alchemist. The results brought about by the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 to 1905 were all unexpected. The Russo-Japanese War led to the outbreak of the Russian Revolution of 1905, which Lenin said was the general rehearsal of the Russian Revolution. What were the results of World War I from 1914 to 1918? The Soviet Union appeared. What were the results of World War II? More socialist countries appeared, and many Asian and African nations gained independence. (Long applause) Therefore, friends, it is very clear that whether it is the socialist movement, the nationalist movement, the establishment of socialist countries, or the achievement of independence by Asian and African nations, it is actually the objective forces generated in the course of history that have brought it about. From this point of view, the Chinese movement is not isolated, the Indonesian movement is not isolated, the Vietnamese movement is not isolated, the Philippine movement is not isolated, and the Russian movement is not isolated. These movements are all built on the same foundation, a revolutionary foundation, (Applause) a foundation of resisting oppression and exploitation. (Applause) I say that they are built on the same revolutionary foundation, but let us not forget that each nation has its own characteristics, its own features, its own trajectory, its own individuality. There are no two people in the world who look exactly alike; similarly, there are no two nations that are exactly the same, without the slightest difference. Therefore, although these movements are in fact built on the same revolutionary foundation, the movements of each nation still have their own characteristics. (Applause) For example, the Indian movement is different from the Indonesian movement or the Chinese movement. Why was the Indian movement able to achieve independence without shedding a drop of blood? This was a bloodless revolution, called the non-cooperation revolution, a revolution based on the principle of "non-violence," for no other reason than the characteristics of the Indian people, who hoped for just such a bloodless, non-cooperative, and non-violent revolution. At the same time, why did the Indonesian movement cause all the Indonesian people to rise up, take up bamboo spears, broadswords, grenades, bombs, and gunpowder? This is because the characteristics of the first period of Indonesia required it. (Applause)

The nature of a movement, besides being determined by its own characteristics, is also determined by the nature of the imperialism it is resisting. The nature of imperialism in India is different from the nature of imperialism in Indonesia. It is these two factors that make the characteristics of the Indian movement different from the characteristics of the Indonesian movement.

Our Indonesian national movement began in the twentieth century. This movement has enabled us to gain independence and begin to face the construction work that we should complete. Later, I will describe the various stages that our national movement has gone through. (Applause)

At the meeting in Xian Nong Tan, I said that before we launched the modern national movement, we had in fact tried to overthrow imperialism. We have waged many local wars, such as the Sultan Agung War, the Surapati War, the Diponegoro War, the Aceh War, etc. However, these wars did not bring us independence. Later, at the beginning of the twentieth century, we launched the national movement using modern methods. This movement, of course, went through several stages of development, because life itself is development. (Applause) The important lesson learned from these wars is that these wars will not succeed because not all the Indonesian people participated in these wars. I just said that these wars were local wars. The war led by Sultan Agung was only carried out within half of Java; the war led by Diponegoro only affected half of Java; the war led by Surapati extended to half of Java; and the Aceh war was only carried out in the Aceh region. This was a great lesson for the Indonesian people. At the beginning of the twentieth century, we began to believe that if we wanted to become a respected and re-independent nation, we should mobilize all the Indonesian people from Sabang to Merauke, and we should live in the struggle of oppressed nations because of oppression. (Applause)

At the beginning of the twentieth century, we launched the national movement. We call this movement the national movement because its purpose is to strive for national independence. We call this movement the national movement because it includes the entire nation, including the Indonesian nation from Sabang to Merauke. As I said just now, this movement went through several stages, which are the stages I will talk about below.

The first stage, I call it the enlightenment stage. In this stage, people believed that as long as they aroused nationalistic feelings, but begged imperialism, begged for broader rights, begged for improved economic conditions, and begged for parliament. Beg, beg, beg, and again, beg. This enlightenment movement believed that we could become a nation living a reasonable life again through the path of begging imperialism. But the fact proves that this political trend, this enlightenment stage, was a complete failure. Their efforts to improve their lives and the fate of the Indonesian nation failed; however, they did not fail in arousing patriotic feelings, arousing nationalistic feelings, and arousing the desire to become respected people. Therefore, we thank this group of pioneers in the enlightenment stage. Their mistake was that they thought that the improvement of life could be obtained by begging. (Applause)

Then came the second stage. The characters in the second stage, we call them elucidators. Hatta and I Sukarno are honored to be characters in this stage. We explained to people that they should not beg imperialism; to improve the lives of the Indonesian people, complete political independence is an essential condition. We said that Indonesia wants independence now, now, but not through begging, but through the power of revolutionary mass struggle. (Long applause)

After the appearance of the figures in this stage, the cry of "Merdeka" resounded through the Indonesian sky like a bolt from the blue, and the Indonesian masses became more and more revolutionary. Just as I said just now, the inevitable consequence of this situation is that action caused reaction. The dialectical development of the situation is that imperialism will not turn a blind eye, and the hammer of imperialism will hit our heads fiercely. I was arrested, Muhammad Hatta was arrested, and hundreds and thousands of leaders were arrested, thrown into prison, and exiled to places such as Riku, Flores, Banda, and Moutine. Some leaders were even hanged for this. Brothers and sisters, as a result, many political parties were completely destroyed by imperialism.

Later, entering the third stage, a third group of figures appeared. After we revolutionary leaders were imprisoned or exiled, the third group of figures began to operate. They tried to achieve their goals through roundabout paths, trying to avoid all actions that might be used by imperialism as an excuse for retaliation. Therefore, we call this group of people "testers." They tried to seek Indonesian independence through the constitutional path stipulated by the Dutch government according to Dutch-Indian laws. They tried to seek Indonesian independence through the so-called legal path. However, this attempt was bound to fail. Because independence cannot be achieved through constitutional means.

Finally, the figures in the new stage appeared, we call them the "figures of the 1945s" or "shockers." They broke open the door, destroyed the constitution, destroyed the regulations, and also destroyed the idea that Indonesia could achieve independence through laws formulated by the Dutch. Brothers and sisters, it was this "figure of the 1945s" or "shocker" who completely destroyed the door of colonialism and established the independent Republic of Indonesia on August 17, 1945. (Long applause)

Brothers and sisters, we declared independence on August 17, 1945, and established the Republic of Indonesia. Of course, the imperialists were not reconciled, their reaction was strong, and their actions were fierce. They fiercely attempted to re-establish colonial rule on our land. Their blows were fierce, not only political blows, not only economic blockades, but also military blows. They launched two military offensives against us. They called this military action "police action." If someone asks, why do you use force against the Indonesian people, then they will answer that our action is a police action, that is, to restore the peace of the Indonesian nation, the Indonesian nation, and the Indonesian people, and to perform the duties of the police to arrest bad elements. But the so-called police action is actually a deception, a lie to deceive the world. The offensive they launched was not a police action, but a genuine military offensive, a genuine war, a genuine colonial war, a genuine imperialist war, with the purpose of restoring colonial rule on Indonesian land. (Applause)

We regained our independence on August 17, 1945. As I said in the United States in the past, we are unwilling and will never give up our independence, even if it is a very small part. We are also unwilling to sell our independence, even if it is a very small part. (Applause) Our slogan is: "Once independent, always independent!" (Applause)

We were burned on a large scale twice. We launched a comprehensive guerrilla war to resist. The number of Indonesians who sacrificed in this guerrilla war to defend independence was not thousands, not tens of thousands, but hundreds of thousands. In this guerrilla war, we implemented a scorched earth policy, burning our houses so that they would not fall into the hands of the Dutch. We blew up bridges, and we carried out a comprehensive guerrilla war. Finally, on December 27, 1949, imperialism was forced to recognize the fact that if a nation has indeed awakened, if a nation does have the spirit of demanding independence, then no power in the world can conquer it. (Applause) They were forced to recognize the Republic of Indonesia. (Applause)

Friends, although our national revolution has not yet been completed, because West Irian has not yet been incorporated into the territory of the Republic of Indonesia. Although our national revolution has not yet been completed, we have now entered the stage of practice. At present, Indonesian practitioners are working to realize the ideals in the hearts of the Indonesian nation, to realize all the ideals that have inspired the entire Indonesian nation to engage in decades of life-and-death struggles, and that have inspired the Indonesian nation to go through fire and water and sacrifice courageously. It is the responsibility of this generation of Indonesians to realize these ideals, and the generation we are referring to is the practitioner.

We are realizing our ideals through five stages, namely the enlightenment stage, the elucidation stage, the attempt stage, the impact stage, and now the practice stage. What are our ideals? We have two ideals, namely political ideals and social ideals. Our political ideal is to establish a free and completely independent Republic of Indonesia, to establish a complete and unblemished country. And what is our social ideal? Our social ideal is to establish a just and prosperous society, a society without poverty and suffering, a society that can guarantee that every Indonesian can live a reasonable life, a society that enables all Indonesians to have adequate food and clothing and live and work in peace and contentment, a just and prosperous society or a socialist society. (Long applause) This is socialism that conforms to the characteristics of the Indonesian nation. This is the socialism mentioned in "Pancasila"; in our provisional constitution, it is called social justice. Yes, we are not acting, fighting, and striving without ideals and principles. From the beginning, our nation had ideals and principles. As I said to the university students just now, when I was young, I was deeply inspired by the ideas put forward by your great late leader Dr. Sun Yat-sen in his book "The Three Principles of the People." This "Three Principles of the People" brought us three principles, three ideals, namely nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. (Applause)

The Indonesian nation opened its eyes, opened its ears, looked abroad, looked around, listened to the ideals of other nations, looked at the undertakings of other nations, listened to what Karl Marx said, listened to what Friedrich Engels said, listened to what Vladimir Ilyich Lenin said, listened to what Arabi Pasha and Mustafa Gamil said, listened to what Turkish Mustafa Kemal said, listened to what Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru said, listened to what Dr. Jose Rizal Imiercado said, listened to what the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen taught in his "Three Principles of the People." The Indonesian nation studied all these ideals, and then looked at itself, digging and searching for its own characteristics in the land of the Indonesian nation. Finally, after refining this -ism and that -ism, all the -isms, a new -ism of the Indonesian nation was produced. In fact, this -ism is not new, because it has long existed in the heart of the Indonesian nation. This new -ism is not the Three Principles of the People, but the Five Principles of the People—Pancasila. (Applause)

Pancasila—Panca means five, Sila means foundation, principle; five foundations, five principles, that is, first, belief in God. The second is Indonesian nationalism. But it is not narrow nationalism, not extreme nationalism, not Indonesian supremacy nationalism, like the "German supremacy" nationalism that Hitler said, but a nationalism that is part of all mankind, a nationalism based on humanity. Therefore, the third founding principle is the principle of humanity. The fourth founding principle is civil rights, that is, democracy, but not democracy copied from Western Europe. What I am referring to is a militant democracy, an advancing democracy. Militant democracy, in my words, is a democracy with leadership, an advancing democracy, to achieve the fifth founding principle, namely: social justice, which is the socialism I just mentioned. Brothers and sisters, it is the five founding principles that have inspired all of us; whether in our domestic policies or in our foreign policies. (Applause)

Therefore, friends, our revolution has certain purposes, political purposes and social purposes, and certain foundations, political foundations and social foundations. When you understand this point, you can easily understand why we are facing several tasks, several tasks that we must complete simultaneously. Several tasks that must be carried out at the same time must be completed together. There are four tasks in total: First, we must eliminate the consequences of our past struggles. As I said just now, our past struggles have left us with many wounds that need to be healed urgently. For example, as I said just now, we implemented a scorched earth policy in the past struggles, blowing up bridges and burning houses, causing suffering to many people. We should eliminate these consequences caused by the struggle. This is the first task. The second task is: to perfect our independence in accordance with our national ideals. I have already said just now what our ideals are. Our ideal is to strive for the complete independence of all Indonesia from Sabang to Merauke. Of course, West Irian should be included. To use an analogy, we have accepted the house, but the garage is still in the hands of the Dutch. We must also take back this garage and connect it with our house.

Brothers and sisters, third, we should fill our homes, which can be said to be empty. The Dutch have plundered our wealth for three hundred and fifty years, and as a result of the guerrilla war, our homes are empty. We must fill it up so that everyone has enough food, clothing, and housing. In a word, build a just and prosperous society that meets our ideals.

Fourth, we should protect the safety of our homes. The great storm of the world is brewing, and brothers and sisters know that war is threatening us from all directions.

Let me repeat, we have four tasks:

First, eliminate the consequences of our
        past struggles and heal the wounds
        left by our past struggles.
Second, perfect our independence and
        make it in line with the ideals of
        our nation. To be clear, recover
        West Irian.
Third, fill our empty homes, build a
        just and prosperous society, and
        realize the ideal of social justice
        in our constitution.
Fourth, protect the safety of our homes
        in the possible coming international
        storm. (Applause)

In particular, enriching the content of our independence is a very great and arduous task. To be honest, it is not difficult to start a country, and it is not difficult to achieve independence. What is really difficult is to build a fair and prosperous society in a country, a society of social justice, in which there is no hardship or suffering, and everyone can live comfortably. Especially when you know that Dutch imperialism ruled us for three hundred and fifty years, making us almost lose all the ability and resources to build such a society. Therefore, the stage we are currently in for the task of enriching the content of our independence is called the investment stage. What kind of capital should we invest? There are three kinds of investment: First, investment in talent. Imperialism has turned us into a nation completely without talent. Imperialism has turned us into an ignorant nation. I once said that imperialism has turned us into a coolie nation and coolies of many nations. We have no talent at all, and our talent has been completely lost. Therefore, our first investment task is investment in talent. Second, we must carry out investment in materials, investment in materials. Because a society of social justice cannot be built on the basis of old conditions. For example, we must implement industrialization. In order to implement industrialization, we still need materials that have yet to be mined and manufactured. Therefore, our second investment is investment in materials. For example, near Surabaya, we have built a huge cement factory, because it can be said that we have no cement at all. And to implement industrialization, we need cement. The third is investment in spirit, that is, investment in morality, thought, desire, and will. I repeat, in the cause of enriching the content of independence, we have only reached the investment stage today. Three kinds of investment: First, investment in talent. Second, investment in materials. Third, investment in spirit. (Applause)

In the investment of talent, that is, the investment in human skills, we can try to obtain external assistance, such as obtaining assistance from you. We can invite you to Indonesia to teach us skills. We can send students to all over the world to explore skills. In short, in terms of investment in talent, we can strive for external help. In the investment of materials, we can also try to obtain external assistance and connect with the outside world. However, in the investment of spirit, the most important thing is the spirit of independence, the spirit of the nation, the soul of the nation, the spirit of construction, the spirit of social justice, the will to struggle, and the selfless work for the realization of social justice. These, we cannot get from the outside world. We have to strive for ourselves, and rely on the efforts and determination of our Indonesian nation. But, friends, in addition to this aspect, we must also seek cooperation with various nations, as long as they are willing to help us, sympathize with us, and carry out common struggles with us. Let me say it again, we have four tasks. First, it is to eliminate the consequences caused by past struggles; when eliminating the consequences caused by past struggles, the most important thing is to make up for material losses. In this regard, we can cooperate with other nations, and we have tried to cooperate with other nations, especially with nations that sympathize with us and carry out the same struggles as us. The second task is to perfect our independence, recover West Irian, and realize our national ideals. In this regard, we should especially establish contact with other nations that sympathize with us. I just said that your revolution, our revolution, the Indian revolution, the Egyptian revolution, the revolutions of Asian and African countries are in fact all built on the same revolutionary foundation, and they are all against imperialism. Your struggle to recover Taiwan is our struggle, and our struggle to recover West Irian is also your struggle. (Long applause)

Our third task is to realize a fair and prosperous society to enrich the content of our independence. I just said that in only one aspect, we must rely on our own strength. In terms of material investment and talent investment, we can help each other.

The fourth task is to defend our independence, defend our country, and defend our homes in the possible international storm that may break out. In this regard, we should also work together. Brothers and sisters, now war is threatening the world. Modern human beings have a high level of science, a scientific level that can catch the sky and carve the sun. However, we human beings all over the world are also suffering great threats because we have a scientific level that can catch the sky and carve the sun. This threat is the threat of atomic war. Therefore, we must work together to realize lasting world peace. (Applause)

I have just said that our country is built on the foundation of Pancasila. It inspires us. Pancasila is the guide for us to deal with all domestic issues, and it is also the guide for us to deal with international affairs. We are a country that implements an independent policy. We do not participate in this group, nor do we participate in that group. However, we are not neutral, we do not stand by and watch the world destroyed. We do not stand by and watch the war break out, no, our policy is an active and independent policy. We are not neutral. We have opinions, and we insist on this opinion, our opinion is Pancasila, and we defend all justice. I said in the United States that we are not sitting on the fence. No, we are proactive. Therefore, we call our policy an active and independent policy. We try, we strive to dedicate our strength to make all mankind safe and not kill each other. We actively mobilized all our progressive forces to convene the Asian-African Conference in Bandung. This conference united 1.6 billion people. We strive to establish friendship with all nations. We know that we are not only comrades and friends with 1.6 billion people, and have common ideas and ideals, but also, as I said at the mass meeting yesterday, 2 billion people demand the realization of a free world, demand that all mankind live in harmony like brothers, demand the elimination of war from this land, and demand the realization of lasting world peace. (Applause)

Friends, as I said yesterday, let us continue to move forward, let us continue to work hard, and let us continue to fight. Let us continue to move forward together, let us continue to work hard together, and let us continue to fight together. If all people with progressive ideas cooperate, then all our ideals will be realized, mankind will live a happy life, and peace will be realized. Our next generation will definitely say that our generation did not live in vain, and that our generation has dedicated our strength to the cause of creating a new world, creating a new world that is independent, free, happy, without poverty, without disputes, with friendship between people, and harmony like brothers, a peaceful new world, a new world for new people. (Applause)

Long live the People's Republic of China! (Applause)
Long live Indonesia! (Applause)
Long live the friendship between the People's Republic of China and Indonesia! (Applause)
Long live world peace! (Applause)
Thank you.

### 在全国人民代表大会常委会政协常委会联席会上苏加诺总统的演说

专栏：

    在全国人民代表大会常委会政协常委会联席会上
    苏加诺总统的演说兄弟姐妹们，朋友们，同志们，
    首先，我对中华人民共和国政府邀请我作为国宾来访问你们的国家，表示万分的感谢。同时，对于各位邀请我到这个扩大会议上发表演说，表示万分的感谢。（鼓掌）
    在这里，我也不得不再提出，你们过于推崇和赞扬我了。我不是独立的缔造者，我不是导致独立的民族运动的缔造者。民族运动乃是帝国主义所激起的客观力量带来的结果。（鼓掌）
    正如今天早上我在清华大学学生面前所说的那样，埃及的独立运动不是加米尔或纳赛尔制造出来的；印度的民族运动不是甘地或尼赫鲁制造出来的；菲律宾的民族运动不是利萨·伊美尔卡多制造出来的。中国的民族运动，事实上并不是孙逸仙或毛泽东主席制造出来的。因此，印度尼西亚的民族运动也不是穆罕默德·哈达或者苏加诺制造出来的。（鼓掌）
    穆斯塔法·加米尔、纳赛尔、甘地、尼赫鲁、利萨·伊美尔卡多、孙逸仙、毛泽东、穆罕默德·哈达、苏加诺这些人都不外是被压迫的人民的喉舌。被压迫人民的运动，正如我在上面所说的是由帝国主义所激起的客观力量带来的。刚才我向大学生们说，西欧发生了商业革命之后，亚洲各民族就开始丧失政治上的独立。接着西欧又发生了产业革命，产业革命产生了资本主义，资本主义又产生了帝国主义，因之，亚非各民族愈来愈不能独立，它们政治上的独立地位逐渐丧失，它们经济上的独立地位更是丧失无遗。
    亚洲和非洲在十九世纪后半世纪和二十世纪前半世纪的历史是贫穷的历史，是被侮辱、被压迫的历史，是受苦受难的历史，是丧失独立的历史。埃及、印度、越南、印度尼西亚、菲律宾、中国和其他民族沦为贫穷的民族，他们作为人类应有的一切权利都丧失了。像印度尼西亚这样一个贫穷的民族可以说是一个“苦力”的民族，又是许多民族的“苦力”，印度尼西亚民族穷到每人每天的生活费用只有两分半钱。
    作用引起了反作用，所以，毫不奇怪，亚洲和非洲的民族总有一天要奋起，总有一天要要求恢复独立，要求重新光荣而自由地生活着，要求重新过着人类应该过的生活，要求重新建立公正而繁荣的社会，要求享有充分权利。因此，这些民族中产生了民族运动。在民族运动中，每个民族都有自己的喉舌和代表。他们只是表达久已蕴藏在人民心中的思想和感情。如果他们不把蕴藏在人民心中的感情、思想、愿望培养起来，并把它表达出来，那么，他们就会连一个人也发动不了。正像我在这里的一次宴会上所说的一样，一个领袖所表达的要是并非早已蕴蓄在人民心中的思想或感情，那么，他就像是一个在沙漠上大喊大叫的无兵的将军。（鼓掌）
    正如一位哲学家斯宾塞所说的一样，一切社会主义的和各民族的反对资本主义和反对帝国主义的运动，不是别的，只不过是被压迫的人们，阶层或民族因为受压迫而激起的反抗。埃及、印度、越南、印度尼西亚、菲律宾、中国和其他地区的民族运动，事实上就是这种因受压迫而激起的反抗。
    这种反抗看起来不过是一种消极的反抗。但是，每一种反抗实际上是一种积极的力量。因为它激发了人类躯体中的一切积极力量，激发了民族的一切积极力量，激发了社会中的一切积极力量去建设，再一次还是建设。是的，进行建设之前要进行某些破坏，但是，根本的目的还是建设——建设独立、建设民族、建设国家、建设社会。（鼓掌）
    反动派、保守派、帝国主义者、资本家忘记了在人类的胸中存在着建设的力量，忘记了在社会中存在着建设的力量。例如他们发动战争——第一次世界大战、第二次世界大战或者是更早一些即1904年至1905年的日俄战争。他们忘记了因受压迫而引起的反抗的建设力量是存在的，忘记了作为战争的结果往往是产生了他们所料想不到的事。有一位哲学家说：“战争是一个奇异的点金术士”。是的，如果从它的结果看来，这是奇怪的。（鼓掌）是的，战争是一个奇异的点金术士。1904年到1905年的日俄战争所带来的结果都是事先没有预料到的。日俄战争导致了1905年俄国革命的爆发，列宁说这是俄国革命的总演习。1914年至1918年的第一次世界大战带来了什么结果呢？苏联出现了。第二次世界大战带来了什么结果呢？有更多的社会主义国家出现了，有很多的亚洲和非洲民族取得了独立。（长时间鼓掌）因此，朋友们，事情是很清楚了，不论是社会主义运动、民族主义运动、社会主义国家的成立或者是亚洲和非洲民族的取得独立，实际上都是历史进程中所产生的客观力量促成的。由此看来，中国的运动并不是孤立的，印度尼西亚的运动并不是孤立的，越南的运动并不是孤立的，菲律宾的运动并不是孤立的，俄罗斯的运动也不是孤立的。这些运动，都是树立在同一个基础上，这是一个革命的基础，（鼓掌）反抗压迫和剥削的基础。（鼓掌）我说，它们树立在同一个革命的基础上，但是，我们不要忘记，每一个民族都各有它自己的特性，它自己的特征，它自己的轨道，它自己的个性。世界上不会有两个长得一模一样的人；同样的，也不会有两个完全相同，分毫不爽的民族。因此，尽管这些运动事实上是树立在同一个革命的基础上，可是，各个民族的运动中却仍各有它自己的特点。（鼓掌）例如，印度的运动同印度尼西亚的运动或者同中国的运动就各有其特点。为什么印度的运动能够不流一滴血而获得独立呢？这是一次不流血的革命，被称为不合作的革命，根据
  “非暴力”原则而进行的革命，原因不是别的，就是因为印度人民的特性，印度人民所盼望的正是这种不流血的、不合作的和非暴力的革命。同时，印度尼西亚的运动为什么会使印度尼西亚全国人民都起来，拿起竹枪、大刀、手榴弹、炸弹和火药？这是因为印度尼西亚第一个时期的特点要求这样做。（鼓掌）
    一个运动的性质，除开决定于它自己的特点之外，还决定于它所反抗的帝国主义的性质。在印度的帝国主义的性质，跟在印度尼西亚的帝国主义的性质不相同。使印度运动的特点跟印度尼西亚运动的特点不同的，正是这两种因素。
    我们印度尼西亚自二十世纪起就开始了民族运动。这个运动使我们获得了独立，并且开始面对着我们应该完成的建设工作。等会儿我要叙述一下我们民族运动经历过的各个阶段。（鼓掌）
    在先农坛的大会上，我已经说过，在我们未开展现代的民族运动以前，我们事实上早就试图推翻帝国主义。我们进行过多次地方性的战争，像苏丹·阿贡战争，苏拉巴底战争，蒂波尼哥罗战争，亚齐战争等等。但是，这些战争并没有给我们带来独立。以后，在二十世纪初，我们用现代化的方法开展了民族运动，这种运动当然经历过好几个发展阶段，因为生活本身就是发展的。（鼓掌）从这些次战争中吸取到的重要教训是：这些战争不会成功，因为并不是全体印度尼西亚人民都参加了这些战争。我刚才已经
  说过，这些战争是地方性的战争。苏丹·阿贡领导下进行的战争，只不过是在半个爪哇岛的范围内进行；蒂波尼哥罗领导下进行的战争所波及的地区只是半个爪哇；苏拉巴底领导下进行的战争延及半个爪哇；亚齐战争只是在亚齐地区进行。这对于印度尼西亚人民是一个很大的教训。二十世纪初，我们开始相信，如果我们想成为一个受尊敬的、重新获得独立的民族，我们就应该把从沙璜到麦老加的全体印度尼西亚人民都发动起来，我们应该生活在被压迫民族因为受压迫而进行的斗争中。（鼓掌）
    二十世纪初，我们开展了民族运动。我们称这个运动为民族运动，因为它的目的是争取民族独立。我们称这个运动为民族运动，因为它包括了整个民族，包括从沙璜到麦老加的印度尼西亚民族。像我刚才说的那样，这个运动经过几个阶段，就是下面我要谈的几个阶段。
    第一个阶段，我把它叫做启蒙阶段。在这一阶段，人们认为，只要激起民族主义的感情，但又向帝国主义乞求，乞求赐给更广泛的权利，乞求改善经济状况，乞求赐给议会。乞求，乞求，乞求，再一次还是乞求。这一启蒙运动认为通过向帝国主义乞求的途径我们就可以成为一个重新过着合理生活的民族。但事实证明，这一个政治潮流，这一启蒙阶段是完全失败了。他们争取改善生活的努力，争取改善印度尼西亚民族命运的努力是失败了；但是，在激起爱国的感情，激起民族主义的感情，激起要求成为受人尊敬的人的愿望方面，他们并没有失败。因此，我们感谢这一批启蒙阶段的先驱，他们的错误是在于他们以为生活的改善是可以乞求得到的。（鼓掌）
    接着是第二个阶段。第二个阶段的人物，我们称他们为阐明者。哈达和我苏加诺很荣幸地是这个阶段的人物。我们向人们说明，不应向帝国主义乞求；要改善印度尼西亚人民的生活，政治上完全独立乃是必不可少的条件。我们说，印度尼西亚现在，现在就要独立，但不是通过乞求的途径，而是通过革命的群众斗争的力量来争取的。（长时间的鼓掌）
    这个阶段的人物出现以后，“默地加”的呼声像晴天霹雳似地响彻印度尼西亚的天空，印度尼西亚的群众越来越革命了。正像我刚才所说的，这种情况的必然后果就是，作用引起了反作用。情况的辩证发展是，帝国主义不会熟视无睹，帝国主义的锤子猛烈地打在我们的头上，我被逮捕了，穆罕默德·哈达被捕，成百成千的领导人被捕，被投进牢狱，被放逐到利古、佛罗列斯、斑达和莫丁等地方。有一些领导人还因此被绞死。兄弟姊妹们，结果，好些政党完全被帝国主义摧残殆尽。
    后来，进入第三阶段，出现了第三批人物。当我们这些革命领导者被关在牢里，或被放逐以后，第三批人物才活动起来。他们试图通过迂回曲折的道路来达到目的，设法避免采取可能被帝国主义利用来作为反击口实的一切行动。因之，这一批人物我们称他为“尝试者”，他们试图通过荷兰政府根据荷印法令所规定的立宪的道路来谋求印度尼西亚的独立。他们试图通过所谓合法的道路来谋求印度尼西亚的独立。但是，这种尝试必然要失败。因为，独立是不能通过立宪的道路来取得的。
    最后，新阶段的人物出现了，我们叫它“1945年代的人物”或者是“冲击者”。他们冲开大门，冲毁了立宪，冲毁了法规，也冲毁了那种认为印度尼西亚可以通过荷兰人一手制定的法律来取得独立的想法。兄弟姊妹们，就是这一个“1945年代的人物”或者“冲击者”把殖民主义的大门完全冲毁，并在1945年8月17日建立了独立的印度尼西亚共和国。（长时间鼓掌）
    兄弟姊妹们，我们在1945年8月17日宣布独立，建立了印度尼西亚共和国。当然，帝国主义者是不甘心的，他们的反应是强烈的，他们的活动是凶狠的，他们凶狠地企图在我们的国土上重新恢复殖民统治。他们的打击是凶狠的，不但有政治上的打击，不但有经济封锁的打击，而且还有军事打击。他们向我们发动了两次军事进攻。他们把这次军事行动称作“警察行动”。如果有人问，你们为什么对印度尼西亚人使用武力呢，那么他们就会回答说，我们的行动是警察行动，也就是说为了恢复印度尼西亚国家，印度尼西亚民族和印度尼西亚人民的安宁，为了执行警察的职务去逮捕坏分子。但是所谓警察行动实际上是欺人之谈，是一种欺骗世界的谎言。他们发动的进攻并非警察行动，而是道地的军事进攻，道地的战争，道地的殖民战争，道地的帝国主义的战争，目的在于恢复在印度尼西亚土地上的殖民统治。（鼓掌）
    1945年8月17日我们重新获得了独立，正如我过去在美国所说的那样，我们不愿也绝不会放弃我们的独立，那怕就是极其微小的一部分。我们也不愿出卖我们的独立，那怕是极其微小的一部分。（鼓掌）我们的口号是：“一旦独立，永远独立！”（鼓掌）
    我们两次遭到大规模的焚烧。我们发动全面的游击战争来进行反抗。在这个游击战争中为保卫独立而牺牲的印度尼西亚人，不是几千、不是几万而是几十万人。在这个游击战争中，我们实行焦土政策、烧毁我们的房子使之不致落在荷兰人手里。我们炸毁桥梁，我们进行全面的游击战争。最后终于在1949年12月27日帝国主义被迫承认了这样的事实，即如果一个民族确实已经觉醒了，如果一个民族确实有了要求独立的精神，那么没有任何人世间的力量能够征服它。（鼓掌）他们被迫承认印度尼西亚共和国。（鼓掌）
    朋友们，现在我们的民族革命虽然尚未完成，因为西伊里安尚未归入印度尼西亚共和国的版图。我们的民族革命虽然尚未完成，但是现在我们已经进入实践阶段。目前印度尼西亚的实践者正在为实现印度尼西亚民族胸中的理想而工作着，为实现所有鼓舞着全体印度尼西亚民族进行数十年生死斗争、鼓舞着印度尼西亚民族赴汤蹈火、奋勇牺牲的理想而工作着。实现这些理想是印度尼西亚这一代人的职责，我们所指的这一代人就是实践者。
    我们是通过五个阶段，即启蒙阶段，阐明阶段，尝试阶段，冲击阶段而现在则是实践阶段，来实现我们的理想。我们的理想是什么呢？我们的理想有两个，即政治理想和社会理想。我们的政治理想是建立一个自由的、完全独立的印度尼西亚共和国，建立一个完整无缺的国家。而我们的社会理想是什么呢？我们的社会理想是建立一个公平和繁荣的社会，一个没有贫穷和苦难的社会，一个能保证每一个印度尼西亚人都能过着合理生活的社会，一个使所有印度尼西亚人都能丰衣足食和安居乐业的社会，一个公平和繁荣的社会或者是社会主义的社会。（长时间的鼓掌）这是符合印度尼西亚民族特点的社会主义。这是“潘查希拉”里头所说的社会主义；在我们的临时宪法中称之为社会公平。是的，我们并不是没有理想和原则地行动、斗争和努力。一开始，我们的民族就有了理想和原则。正如我刚才对大学生们所说的那样，当我年青时我自己深为你们伟大的已故领袖孙逸仙博士在他的
  “三民主义”一书中所提出的思想所鼓舞。这个“三民主义”给我们带来了三个原则、三个理想，即民族、民权、民生。（鼓掌）
    印度尼西亚民族睁开眼睛、张起耳朵，向国外看看、到处看看，听听其他民族的理想、看看其他民族的事业，倾听卡·马克思所讲的话，倾听弗·恩格斯所讲的话，倾听弗·伊·列宁所讲的话，倾听阿拉比帕夏和穆斯塔法·加米尔所讲的话，倾听土耳其穆斯塔法·凯末尔所讲的话，倾听马·甘地和贾·尼赫鲁所讲的话，倾听何塞·利萨·伊米尔卡多博士所讲的话，倾听已故孙逸仙博士在他的“三民主义”里所教导的话。印度尼西亚民族研究这所有的理想，随后看看自己，在印度尼西亚民族的土地上挖掘、寻找自己的特点。最后，在把这个主义，那个主义，所有的主义提炼之后，就产生了印度尼西亚民族的新的主义。实际上这个主义并不新，因为它早就存在于印度尼西亚民族的心中。这个新的主义并不是三民主义，而是五民主义——潘查希拉。（鼓掌）
    潘查希拉—潘查的意思是五，希拉的意思是基础、原则；五个基础，五个原则，那就是第一、信仰上帝。第二是印度尼西亚民族主义。但并不是狭隘的民族主义，并不是极端的民族主义，并不是印度尼西亚至上的民族主义，像希特勒所说的：“德意志至上”的那种民族主义，而是属于全人类的一部分的民族主义，是基于人道的民族主义，因此，便产生了第三个建国原则，即人道原则。第四个建国原则是民权，也就是民主，但并不是向西欧抄袭过来的民主，而我所指的民主是一个战斗的民主，前进的民主。战斗的民主，用我的话来说，就是有领导的民主，前进的民主，是为了实现第五个建国原则，即：社会公平，也就是我刚才所说的社会主义。兄弟姊妹们，正是建国五原则鼓舞了我们大家；不管是在我们的国内政策方面，抑或是在我们的外交政策方面。（鼓掌）
    因此，朋友们，我们的革命有一定的目的，政治的目的和社会的目的，有一定的基础，政治基础和社会基础。当你们了解这点以后，你们就容易了解，为什么说我们面临着几项任务，几项要我们同时完成的任务。几项要在同一时间进行的任务要我们一总完成。这些任务一共有四项：第一、我们要消弥由于我们过去的斗争而引起的后果。像我刚才所说的那样，我们过去的斗争给我们留下许多亟待治愈的创伤。例如，刚才我所说的，我们过去在斗争中实行了焦土政策，炸毁了桥梁，焚烧了房屋，给不少人带来了痛苦。我们应该消弥这些由于斗争而引起的后果。这是第一项任务。第二项任务是：根据我们的民族理想，使我们的独立趋于完善。刚才我已经说过，我们的理想是什么，我们的理想是争取从沙璜到麦老加全印度尼西亚的完全独立。当然，应该包括西伊里安在内。打一个比方说，我们已经接受了房子，但是汽车房还在荷兰手中，这座汽车房我们也要收回，要把它和我们的房子连在一块。
    兄弟姊妹们，第三，我们应该充实我们的可以说已经空空荡荡的家园。荷兰人掠夺我们的财富已有三百五十年，加上游击战争的结果，我们的家园是空空荡荡了。我们必须充实它，让大家有充足的粮食，衣着和住屋。一句话，建设一个合乎我们的理想的公平和繁荣的社会。
    第四，我们应该保护我们家园的安全。世界的大风暴正在酝酿着，兄弟姊妹们都知道，战争从四方八面威胁着我们。
    我重复一遍，我们的任务有四项：
    第一、消除我们过去斗争所遗
            下的后果，医治我们过
            去斗争所留下的创伤。
    第二、使我们的独立趋于完
            善，使它符合我们民族
            的理想。明确地说，收
            回西伊里安。
    第三、充实我们那空荡的家
            园，建设一个公平和繁
            荣的社会，实现我们
          宪法中的社会公平的
            理想。
    第四、在可能到来的国际风暴
          中，保护我们家园的安
            全。（鼓掌）
    尤其是充实我们独立的内容是非常伟大和艰巨的任务。说实话，开国创业并不难，实现独立也不难，真正艰巨的是要在一个国家中建设一个公平繁荣的社会，社会公道的社会，在这个社会里，无所谓酸辛困苦，各个人都能够安适地过活。特别是当你们知道荷兰帝国主义统治了我们三百五十年，使我们几乎丧失一切可以建设这样的社会的能力和物资的时候。因此，我们目前要充实我们独立的内容这一任务所处的阶段，我叫它作投资的阶段。投些什么资本呢？有三种投资：第一、才能的投资，帝国主义把我们变成一个完全没有才能的民族。帝国主义把我们变成愚昧的民族。我曾经说过，帝国主义把我们变成了苦力的民族和许多民族的苦力。我们完全没有才能，我们的才能被消失殆尽。因此，我们的第一个投资任务是才能的投资，第二必须进行物质的投资，物资的投资。因为一个社会公道的社会是不可能建筑在旧条件的基础上。例如，我们必须实行工业化，为了实行工业化，我们还需要尚待挖掘和制造的物资，因此，我们的第二个投资是物质的投资。例如，在泗水附近，我们建立了巨大的水泥厂，因为，可以说我们是完全没有水泥的。而要实行工业化，我们是需要水泥的。第三是精神的投资，即道德、思想、愿望、意志的投资。我重说一遍，在充实独立内容的事业上，我们今天刚达到投资的阶段。三种投资：第一，才能的投资。第二，物质的投资。第三，精神的投资。（鼓掌）
    在才能的投资上，即人类本领的投资上，我们可以设法取得外界的援助，例如从你们那里取得援助。我们可以邀请你们到印度尼西亚给我们传授本领。我们可以派遣留学生到全世界去探求本领。总之，在才能的投资方面，我们是可以争取外界的帮助。在物质的投资上，我们也可以设法取得外界的援助，跟外界联系。但是，在精神的投资上，最重要的是独立的精神，民族的精神，民族的灵魂，建设的精神，社会公道的精神，斗争的意志，为实现社会公道而忘我地工作。这些，我们不能从外界得到。要我们自己去争取，要依靠我们印度尼西亚民族自己的努力和决心。但是，朋友们，除了这方面以外，我们也要寻求同各个民族的合作，只要他们愿意帮助我们，同情我们，同我们进行共同的斗争。让我再说一次，我们的任务有四项。首先，是要消除过去斗争所引起的后果；在消除过去斗争所引起的后果的时候，最重要的是要弥补物质上的损失。在这方面，我们可以同其他民族合作，而且我们已经设法同其他民族进行合作，特别是同同情我们、跟我们进行同样斗争的民族合作。第二项任务是使我们的独立臻于完善，收回西伊里安，实现我们的民族理想。在这方面，我们尤其应该同同情我们的其他民族建立联系。我刚才说过，你们的革命，我们的革命，印度的革命，埃及的革命，亚非各国的革命，事实上都是建立在同一个革命基础上，都是反对帝国主义的。你们收复台湾的斗争就是我们的斗争，我们收复西伊里安的斗争也就是你们的斗争。（长时间的鼓掌）
    我们的第三个任务是实现一个公平、繁荣的社会来充实我们独立的内容。我刚才说过，只有在一个方面，我们必须依靠自己的力量。在物资投资和人才投资方面，我们是可以互相帮助的。
    第四个任务，是在可能爆发起的国际暴风雨中保卫我们的独立，保卫我们的国家，保卫我们的家园。在这方面，我们还应该携手合作。兄弟姊妹们，现在战争在威胁着世界。现代的人类具有高度的科学水平，具有可以抓天刻日那样的科学水平。但是，我们全世界的人类也正是因为具有可以抓天刻日的那样的科学水平而遭受着极大的威胁，这威胁就是原子战争的威胁。因此，我们必须共同努力来实现世界的持久和平。（鼓掌声）
    我刚才已经说过，我们的国家是建立在潘查希拉的基础上的。它鼓舞着我们。潘查希拉是我们处理一切内政问题的指南，也是我们处理国际事务的指南。我们是执行独立政策的国家。我们不参加这个集团，也不参加那个集团。但是，我们并不是中立的，我们并不袖手旁观让世界毁灭。我们并不袖手旁观让战争爆发，不，我们的政策是积极的独立的政策。我们并不中立。我们有主张，而且坚持这个主张，我们的主张就是潘查希拉，我们保卫一切正义。我在美国说过我们并不是骑墙观望的。不，我们是积极主动的。因此，我们把我们的政策称为积极的、独立的政策。我们设法，我们努力献出我们的力量使全世界的人类获得安全，不互相残杀。我们积极地动员我们的一切进步力量在万隆召开亚非会议。这个会议团结了十六亿人。我们努力同所有的民族建立友谊。我们知道，我们不仅同十六亿人结成了同志和朋友，并且有着共同的思想和理想，而且正如我昨天在群众大会上所说的那样，二十亿人要求实现一个自由的世界，要求全体人类像兄弟般地和睦相处，要求从这个土地上消灭战争，要求实现世界持久和平。（鼓掌）
    朋友们，正如我昨天所说的那样，让我们继续前进，让我们继续努力，让我们继续斗争。让我们继续共同前进，让我们继续共同努力，让我们继续共同斗争。如果所有具有进步思想的人们共同合作，那么我们的一切理想必将实现，人类必将过幸福的生活、和平必将实现。我们的下一代必然会说我们这一代并不是白活的，我们这一代已经把我们的力量献给了创立新世界的事业，创立一个独立的，自由的，幸福的，没有贫困的，没有纠纷的，人和人之间友好的，像兄弟一样和睦相处的新世界，一个和平的新世界，一个新人的新世界。（鼓掌）
    中华人民共和国万岁！（鼓掌）
    印度尼西亚万岁！（鼓掌）
    中华人民共和国—印度尼西亚友好万岁！（鼓掌）
    世界和平万岁！（鼓掌）
    谢谢。
