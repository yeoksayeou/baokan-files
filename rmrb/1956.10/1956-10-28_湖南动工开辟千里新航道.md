Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, October 26th. The project to open 1,014 kilometers of shipping lanes in Hunan Province this year has now begun full-scale construction. Currently, more than 7,000 laborers from thirteen counties and cities, including Shaoyang, Xinhua, Chenxi, and Hongjiang, are working intensely on these new routes, drilling and blasting, and dredging underwater.

The new shipping lanes being opened include many sections of the Yuan River from Chenxi to Hongjiang, the Zi River from Yiyang to Shaoyang, and the Lei River from Leiyang to Yongxing. The two new waterway sections being opened on the Yuan and Zi Rivers have historically been fraught with shoals and reefs, making navigation difficult not only for ships but also for wooden boats. Once the new waterways are opened, goods can be transported in and out via ships from the upper and lower reaches of the two rivers in a steady stream. It is estimated that this will increase the volume of goods transported by more than 2.6 million tons annually. After the completion of the Leiyang to Yongxing section of the Lei River shipping lane, the locally state-owned Xiangyong Coal Mine alone will be able to ship out more than 50,000 tons of goods per month via ships. To open these new waterways, relevant departments in Hunan Province organized forces to survey and design these waterway projects in the first half of this year.

In addition, among the twenty-six shoal dredging projects planned to start this year on existing shipping lanes in Hunan Province, nine have already commenced construction.

    湖南动工开辟千里新航道
    新华社长沙26日电　湖南省今年计划开辟的一千零一十四公里的轮船航道工程，现在已经开始全面施工。目前，邵阳、新化、辰溪和洪江等十三个县市的七千多民工，正在这些新航线上紧张地进行打眼放炮、潜水疏浚等工作。
    正在开辟的轮船新航道有沅水的辰溪至洪江、资水的益阳至邵阳、耒水的耒阳至永兴等许多段。沅水、资水正在开辟的两段新航道，历来滩险很多，礁石林立，不但轮船不能行驶，而且木船运输也很困难，新航道开辟成功后，两水上下游的物资就可以经由轮船源源运进运出，估计每年可以增加物资运输量二百六十多万吨。耒水的耒阳至永兴段的轮船航道开辟成功后，单是地方国营湘永煤矿每月就可以通过轮船运出五万吨以上的物资。为了开辟这些新航道，湖南省有关部门在今年上半年即组织力量对这些航道工程进行了勘测和设计。
    另外，湖南省原有轮船航道中计划今年动工的二十六个浅滩疏浚工程，目前已有九个先后动工。
