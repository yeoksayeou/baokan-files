Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: The Korean Democratic People's Republic National Art Theater's other performance during its visit to China—the opera "Shim Cheong"—premiered in Beijing tonight.

　　"Shim Cheong" is also a representative oral literary work of Korea. Through the self-sacrifice of a poor girl who gave her life to restore her blind father's sight, and her salvation in a mythical story, the opera vividly depicts the life of the most oppressed and exploited people in feudal society and their longing for a beautiful future, using vivid fantasy techniques.

    朝鲜民族艺术剧团在京演出“沈清传”
    据新华社29日讯　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国立民族艺术剧团访华演出的另一个剧目——唱剧“沈清传”，今晚在北京上演。
      “沈清传”也是朝鲜的代表性的口传文艺作品。这个剧通过一个为了使失明的父亲重见光明而献出生命的贫苦少女的自我牺牲和她的获救的神话故事，用生动的幻想手法描绘了封建社会最受压迫和剥削的人民的生活情景和他们对于未来美景的憧憬。
