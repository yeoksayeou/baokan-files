Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 11th—According to TASS, the French newspaper "Le Monde" published an interview between its reporter and Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba on the Algerian question. In the interview, Bourguiba emphasized that France must recognize Algeria's right to independence. He said: "The right to independence is a natural and inalienable right for Algerians and for all other nations. It is impossible for an Algeria ruled by foreigners to exist between independent Tunisia and Morocco. It is simply inconceivable."

The Tunisian Prime Minister continued: "Two years of very difficult war have made social figures aware that Algerians can no longer continue to live under oppression and humiliation as before… while the French are being deceived that appeasement can promote progress."

Bourguiba pointed out that, in fact, there is a war going on in Algeria and this war must be ended as soon as possible.

Bourguiba also said that if an agreement cannot be reached on Algeria before the upcoming session of the United Nations General Assembly, Tunisia will have to strive to include the Algerian question on the agenda of the meeting.

    突尼斯首相布尔吉巴说
    法国必须承认阿尔及利亚独立
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社巴黎11日讯：法国“世界报”发表了该报记者就阿尔及利亚问题同突尼斯首相布尔吉巴的谈话。在谈话中，布尔吉巴强调法国必须承认阿尔及利亚的独立权利。他说：“独立权利，对阿尔及利亚人以及对其他一切民族来说，都是当然的和不可剥夺的权利。在独立的突尼斯和摩洛哥之间，存在一个被外国统治的阿尔及利亚，这是不可能的。这简直是不可思议的。
    突尼斯首相接着说：“两年非常艰苦的战争使社会人士知道，阿尔及利亚人不能再像以前一样继续生活在压迫和屈辱下。……而法国人被哄骗说，绥靖主义可以促进进步。
    布尔吉巴指出，事实上，在阿尔及利亚正进行着战争，必须尽快地结束这个战争。
    布尔吉巴还说，假使在行将到来的联合国大会会议召开之前，还不能在阿尔及利亚获得协议，突尼斯将不得不争取把阿尔及利亚问题列入会议议程。
