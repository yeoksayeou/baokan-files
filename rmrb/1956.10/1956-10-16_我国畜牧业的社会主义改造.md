    Socialist Transformation of Animal Husbandry in China
    Wang Feng, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission

    Animal husbandry in China is widely distributed. Pastoral areas account for about 40% of the country's total area, of which more than 90% are areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities. The main groups engaged in animal husbandry production are the Mongolian, Tibetan, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik, and Yugur nationalities, with a population of approximately three million. The animal husbandry economy is an important component of China's national economy.

    Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and thanks to the active efforts of the Party committees and governments in the pastoral areas and the people of ethnic minorities, the social landscape of most pastoral areas in China has undergone significant changes. Most ethnic autonomous areas have been established, and those that have not are actively preparing for their establishment; the number of ethnic minority cadres has increased considerably; unity among and within ethnic groups has been generally strengthened; the number of livestock has nearly doubled compared to 1949; the material and cultural lives of herders have been improved and elevated; and mutual aid and cooperation in animal husbandry have also seen some development. These changes have greatly encouraged working herders and have played a powerful role in promoting the development of animal husbandry production.

    With the continuous development of politics, economy, and culture in China's pastoral areas, especially due to the enormous impact of the nationwide socialist upsurge, many major and pressing issues that need to be resolved have been raised in the pastoral areas. For example: the scattered and backward individual animal husbandry cannot meet the growing needs of the state and the people for animal products; the pastoral areas have felt the lack of labor due to the development of production; with the large increase in livestock, pasture and water resources urgently need unified planning and rational use; the difficulties of poor herders in production and life need to be thoroughly resolved, and so on. These issues have all presented the task of socialist transformation of animal husbandry to the Party and the people of all nationalities. Obviously, without realizing the task of socialist transformation of animal husbandry, it is impossible to thoroughly solve the many problems that have occurred in pastoral areas, and to push animal husbandry production to a higher stage of development, to completely change the face of the pastoral areas. It cannot be conceived.

    According to the characteristics of animal husbandry areas, the Party's policy for implementing the socialist transformation of animal husbandry is: to rely on the laboring herders, unite all forces that can be united, and gradually realize the socialist transformation of animal husbandry on the basis of steadily developing animal husbandry production. There is no doubt that this policy is absolutely correct.

    The development of our work in pastoral areas is uneven. At present, it can be basically divided into three situations. That is: some already have the conditions for transformation; some have several positive factors growing, but have not yet fully possessed the conditions for transformation; and some basically do not have the conditions for transformation. Those who already have the conditions for transformation should actively develop mutual aid and cooperation; those who have not fully possessed the conditions for transformation can conduct pilot programs; and those who do not have the conditions for transformation should actively carry out work to create conditions. Currently, they cannot develop mutual aid and cooperation, nor can they conduct pilot programs.

    The purpose of implementing the socialist transformation of animal husbandry is to liberate the productive forces, develop animal husbandry production, improve the material and cultural lives of the people in pastoral areas, and meet the needs of the state and the people.

    The socialist transformation of animal husbandry includes two aspects: the transformation of the individual herder economy and the transformation of the livestock owner economy. According to the Party's policy and the working experience in pastoral areas: the animal husbandry economy of individual herders is to gradually transform the scattered and nomadic management methods into a cooperative and modern socialist animal husbandry economy, according to the principles of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, through the road of mutual aid and cooperation. For the livestock owner economy, the policy of peaceful transformation is adopted, using diverse methods, economically adopting the method of redemption, continuing to unite livestock owners politically, making appropriate arrangements for their work and lives according to the principle of not reducing their political status and living standards, striving for their support for peaceful transformation, and gradually achieving the goal of abolishing exploitation and changing ownership.

    Individual herders account for the vast majority of the people in pastoral areas. Therefore, organizing individual herders is the central link in realizing the socialist transformation of animal husbandry. Organized animal husbandry production, especially animal husbandry production cooperatives, has great superiority over individual and scattered management methods. The main benefits of animal husbandry production cooperatives are: first, they can concentrate manpower, material resources, and financial resources, unify production planning, rationally organize and use labor, improve labor efficiency, adopt advanced technologies, improve feeding management, develop diverse economies, effectively defend against natural disasters, ensure the development of production, and increase the income of members. Second, they can rationally arrange production according to national plans and facilitate socialist education for members. Third, they can resolve pasture and water disputes, help resolve agricultural and pastoral contradictions, better realize the mutual support and combination of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry, thereby promoting national unity. It can be seen that developing semi-socialist animal husbandry production cooperatives is a decisive link in realizing the socialist transformation of animal husbandry.

    In carrying out the work of mutual aid and cooperation in animal husbandry, it is necessary to emphasize adherence to the principle of voluntariness, adopt diverse forms, advance steadily, and the state must provide support and assistance, which is absolutely correct and necessary. For herders who are still unwilling to participate in mutual aid and cooperation, we must wait, continue to influence them with methods of persuasion and education and with practical examples of increased production in cooperatives, and any coercion or commandism should be resolutely prevented. Reasonable demands of herders after joining the cooperative should be seriously resolved, and herders should be allowed to retain riding horses, dairy cows, edible sheep, and necessary production tools. We must do our best to ensure that the income of herders after joining the cooperative is not less than before joining the cooperative, and gradually increase it year by year, and in daily life, we must also pay attention to ensuring that members do not feel inconvenienced.

    The transformation of the livestock owner economy must definitely adopt the policy of peaceful transformation. In terms of the form, timing, and steps of the transformation, livestock owners should be given more room for consideration, everything should be repeatedly and carefully negotiated, and it should be done after obtaining their genuine consent, otherwise it is better to postpone it. The forms of transformation should be diverse, for example, adopting methods such as livestock being raised on behalf of the cooperative or state-owned farms based on the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, or the state sending in cadres and investing technical forces to help manage, or organizing joint state-private animal husbandry farms, or absorbing livestock owners to participate in cooperatives and state-owned farms, etc. As long as it is conducive to the development of production, adopting one of these forms, or simultaneously adopting several forms, is acceptable. If some livestock owners still wish to continue working independently, or have joined cooperatives, state-owned farms, etc., and want to withdraw, they should also be allowed. In terms of the conditions for joining the cooperative or farm, the proportion of shares, dividends, fixed interest rates, and the number of edible and draft livestock retained, should be relaxed and not restricted too strictly. The purpose of doing this is to minimize shocks and damage as much as possible, and to exchange for a stable situation for developing production, which is conducive to national unity and conducive to socialist transformation. Therefore, it is necessary to lengthen the time.

    The animal husbandry economy is mainly livestock, which is both a means of production and a means of livelihood, and is easily subject to natural and man-made damage. Also, due to the complexity of the situation in pastoral areas, if our policies are not well implemented, dampen the enthusiasm of herders for production, or cause unnecessary concerns among livestock owners, it is easy to cause a large number of livestock deaths, and it is not easy to recover after the damage for a considerable period. This characteristic of pastoral areas requires us to proceed more cautiously when carrying out the socialist transformation of animal husbandry. Some comrades do not have sufficient understanding of this characteristic of pastoral areas, and in the process of implementing the socialist transformation of animal husbandry, they often have a sense of impatience, resulting in losses to the work and damage to production, which in turn brings many difficulties to the socialist transformation. This situation must be prevented.

    In pastoral areas where democratic reforms have not been completed or systematically carried out, there is not only the issue of socialist transformation, but also the issue of democratic reform to abolish feudal privileges and feudal exploitation. In these areas, the task of democratic reform can be completed simultaneously with socialist transformation; or the democratic reform can first be completed through peaceful consultation, and then socialist transformation can be carried out; it should be adapted to local conditions and not be forced to be uniform.

    Whether in pastoral areas where conditions exist for socialist transformation or in pastoral areas where conditions do not yet exist for socialist transformation, we should not change the various policies that have been effective for many years of not struggling, not dividing, not classifying classes, benefiting both herdsmen and livestock owners, and supporting the production of poor herdsmen; we should continue to implement price policies and tax policies that are conducive to animal husbandry production; at the same time, for some measures to protect and increase livestock, such as improving water and grass, building water conservancy projects, eliminating pests and animals, storing grass and building enclosures, preventing animal epidemics, improving livestock breeds, advocating planting pasture, opening feed bases, issuing loans, supplying machinery, training veterinarians, and promoting the settlement of nomadic herders, etc., should be adhered to. Because these policies and measures are conducive to the development of production and conducive to socialist transformation.

    The ethnic minorities engaged in animal husbandry production in our country generally have deep religious beliefs. Therefore, we must adhere to the policy of freedom of religious belief and the policy of protecting temples for a long time. For issues involving religious temples, such as the livestock occupied by the upper religious circles of the temples, the handling should be more generous and more stable, the time should be longer, and their opinions should be fully respected; whenever they are willing to change, they will change, and the Party and the government will not force them.

    We have the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, as long as we work hard and conscientiously implement the Party's various policies in pastoral areas, the task of realizing the socialist transformation of animal husbandry will definitely be successfully completed.

    我国畜牧业的社会主义改造
    民族事务委员会副主任　汪锋
    我国的畜牧业分布很广。牧业区的面积约占全国总面积的40％，其中90％以上是少数民族聚居区。主要从事畜牧业生产的有蒙、藏、哈萨克、柯尔克孜、塔吉克和裕固等六个民族，人口约三百万。畜牧业经济是我国国民经济的一个重要的组成部分。
    解放以来，在党中央的正确领导下，由于牧业区的党委、政府和少数民族人民的积极努力，我国大部分牧业区的社会面貌已经发生了显著的变化。民族自治地方已经大部建立，没有建立的也正在积极筹备建立；民族干部已经有相当数量的增长；民族之间和民族内部的团结已经普遍加强；牲畜头数较1949年增加将近一倍；牧民的物质和文化生活得到了改善和提高；畜牧业的互助合作也有了一些发展。这些变化给了劳动牧民以极大的鼓舞，对畜牧业生产的发展起着有力的推动作用。
    随着我国牧业区政治、经济和文化的不断发展，特别是由于全国社会主义高潮的巨大影响，牧业区已经提出了许多重大的和迫切需要解决的问题。例如：分散的、落后的个体畜牧业已经不能适应国家和人民对畜产品日益增长的需要；牧业区由于生产的发展已经感到劳动力的缺乏；牲畜大量增殖，牧场水草迫切需要统一规划，合理使用；贫苦牧民在生产和生活中的困难需要彻底解决等等。这些问题，都在党和各民族人民的面前提出了对畜牧业进行社会主义改造的任务。很明显，不实现对畜牧业的社会主义改造的任务，要想彻底解决牧业区已经发生的许多问题，并且把畜牧业生产推向更高的发展阶段，而达到完全改变牧业区的面貌，是做不到的，不能设想的。
    根据畜牧业区的特点，党所提出的对畜牧业实行社会主义改造的方针是：依靠劳动牧民，团结一切可以团结的力量，在稳步发展畜牧业生产的基础上，逐步地实现对畜牧业的社会主义改造。毫无疑问，这个方针是十分正确的。
    我们牧业区的工作发展是不平衡的，目前基本上可以分为三种情况。即：有的已经具备了改造的条件；有的虽有若干积极因素在生长，但还没有完全具备改造的条件；有的基本上还没有具备改造的条件。已经具备了改造条件的应当积极开展互助合作；还没有完全具备改造条件的即可进行试办；还没有具备改造条件的则应当积极进行工作，创造条件，目前还不能发展互助合作，也不能进行试办。
    对畜牧业实行社会主义改造的目的，就是为了解放生产力，发展畜牧业生产，改善牧业区人民的物质、文化生活，并且满足国家和人民的需要。
    畜牧业的社会主义改造，包括对个体牧民经济和对牧主经济改造的两个方面。根据党的政策和牧业区的工作经验：对于个体牧民的畜牧经济是按照自愿互利的原则，通过互助合作的道路，把分散、游牧的经营方式，逐步改造成为合作化、现代化的社会主义畜牧经济。对于牧主经济是采取和平改造的方针，通过多种多样方式，在经济上采用赎买的办法，在政治上继续团结牧主，按照不降低他们的政治地位和生活水平的原则，对他们的工作和生活，作出适当安排，争取他们赞助和平改造，逐步达到废除剥削和改变所有制的目的。
    个体牧民占牧业区人民的绝大多数，因此，把个体牧民组织起来，是实现畜牧业社会主义改造的中心环节。组织起来的畜牧业生产，特别是畜牧业生产合作社比起个体的、分散的经营方式具有极大的优越性。畜牧业生产合作社的主要好处是：第一，可以集中人力、物力和财力，统一生产规划，合理地组织使用劳动力，提高劳动效率，采取先进技术，改善饲养管理，发展多种经济，有效地防御自然灾害，保证发展生产，增加社员收入。第二，可以根据国家计划，合理安排生产，并且便于向社员进行社会主义教育。第三，可以解决牧场、水草纠纷，有利于解决农牧矛盾，更好地实现工、农、牧业的相互支援和结合，从而有利于民族团结。可见，发展半社会主义性质的牧业生产合作社是实现对畜牧业社会主义改造的决定性的一环。
    在开展畜牧业互助合作的工作中，必须强调遵守自愿原则，采取多样的形式，稳步前进，并且由国家给以支持和帮助，是完全正确的、必要的。对于还不愿意参加互助合作的牧民，一定要有所等待，继续用说服教育的办法和合作社增产的实际事例去影响他们，任何强迫命令都是应该坚决防止的。对于牧民入社后的合理要求，都应当给以认真的解决，允许牧民自留乘马、奶牛、食用羊和必要的生产工具。必须尽最大力量做到牧民入社后的收入比入社以前不减少，并且逐年增加，而且在日常生活中也必须注意使社员不至于感到不方便。
    对牧主经济的改造，肯定地要采取和平改造的方针。在改造的形式、时间和步骤上，都应当给牧主更多的考虑余地，凡事要反复、认真地协商，取得他们真正的同意之后再去办，否则宁可缓办。改造的形式，应当是多样的，例如，在自愿两利的原则下，采用由合作社和国营牧场代放牲畜，或者由国家派进干部和投进技术力量帮助经营或者组织公私合营牧场，或者吸收牧主参加合作社和国营牧场等等，只要是有利于发展生产，采取其中的某一形式，或者同时采取几种形式都是可以的。如果有的牧主仍然愿意继续单干，或者已经加入了合作社、国营牧场等又想退出来，也应该允许。在入社、入场的条件上，在入股、分红、定息的比例上，在自留食用、役用牲畜的数量上，都应当放宽一些，不可限制太严。我们这样做，其目的就是为了尽可能地减少震动和破坏，换取一个稳定发展生产的局面，有利于民族团结，有利于社会主义改造。因此，时间拖长一些也是必要的。
    畜牧业经济主要是牲畜，它既是生产资料又是生活资料，很容易遭受自然的和人为的破坏。还由于牧业区的情况复杂，如果我们的政策执行不好，挫伤了牧民生产的积极性，或者引起了牧主的不必要的顾虑，就很容易造成牲畜的大量死亡，而且破坏以后相当长的期间不容易恢复起来。牧业区的这种特点，要求我们在对畜牧业进行社会主义改造的时候必须更加稳妥地去进行。有的同志对于牧业区的这种特点认识不够，在对畜牧业实行社会主义改造的过程中，往往产生急躁情绪，结果工作受到损失，生产遭到破坏，反而给社会主义改造带来许多困难，这种情况，必须注意防止。
    在没有完成和还没有系统进行民主改革的牧业区，不仅有社会主义改造的问题，而且还有废除封建特权和封建剥削的民主改革问题。在这类地区，民主改革的任务，可以在社会主义改造中同时去完成；或者首先采用和平协商的方式完成民主改革，然后再进行社会主义改造；应当因地制宜，不必强求一律。
    无论是在有条件进行社会主义改造的牧业区或者是还没有条件进行社会主义改造的牧业区，都不应当改变多年来行之有效的不斗不分、不划阶级、牧工牧主两利和扶持贫苦牧民生产的各项政策；应当继续执行有利于畜牧业生产的价格政策和税收政策；同时对于保畜增畜的一些措施，例如，改良水草，兴修水利，消灭虫兽害，储草打圈，兽疫防治，改良畜种，提倡种植牧草，开辟饲料基地，发放贷款，供给机械，训练兽医和提倡牧民定居游牧等，都应当坚持贯彻下去。因为这些政策和措施都是有利于发展生产，有利于社会主义改造的。
    我国从事畜牧业生产的各少数民族，一般都有较深的宗教信仰。因此，必须长期坚持宗教信仰自由政策和保护寺庙的政策。对于涉及宗教寺庙问题，例如对寺庙宗教上层占有的牲畜，处理的时候，应该更宽大、更稳妥，在时间上更长一些，并且要充分尊重他们的意见；他们愿意什么时候改，就在什么时候改，党和政府不去勉强。
    我们有党中央的正确领导，只要我们努力工作，认真地贯彻党在牧业区的各项政策，那么对畜牧业实现社会主义改造的任务是一定能够胜利完成的。
