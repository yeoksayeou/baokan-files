    Ikeda Masanosuke said, "The future of trade between China and Japan is bright." He said that the Third Japan-China Trade Agreement signed in Tokyo last year has expired. After friendly consultations, both sides have basically reached an agreement on the issue of whether to extend the term, and are prepared to announce the results of this consultation tonight.

    Ikeda Masanosuke also mentioned that the opening of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition in Beijing demonstrates the Chinese people's concern for the Japanese people. This is the best gift he can bring back to the Japanese people.

He believes that this conversation was completely friendly and without barriers, and they were very happy. He said that through this conversation, he learned about the Chinese government's views on Sino-Japanese trade and relations between the two countries. Therefore, he believes that this conversation is conducive to the future development of relations between Japan and China.

    Regarding his views on the Japan-Soviet negotiations, Ikeda Masanosuke said that the highest-level Japan-Soviet talks have already begun today in Moscow. This meeting must be conducted in a friendly atmosphere, because he believes that the Japan-Soviet talks will inevitably have a good outcome. In response to the question of what impact this meeting would have on Japan domestically, he said that most Japanese people welcome and support this meeting, although there are some who oppose it, but he believes the result will be good.
