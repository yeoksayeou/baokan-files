Xinhua News Agency, 26th dispatch: The Sino-Burmese Friendship Association held a welcoming rally at the Capital Theatre tonight to welcome U Nu, Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma.

In his speech at the welcoming rally, Chairman U Nu emphasized that for the sake of world peace, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by China, India, and Burma should not only be accepted by these three initiating countries but also by all countries in the world. Chairman U Nu said that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are five principles that can save the world from a terrible disaster. Currently, all over the world, people are manufacturing various weapons and are mass-producing atomic and hydrogen weapons that can turn a large part of the world into ashes. Such actions are actions that promote the outbreak of a very terrible war. Therefore, for the sake of world peace, I wish these five principles to be supported by the whole world, including the three initiating countries of China, India, and Burma.

In his speech, Chairman U Nu first thanked the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association for welcoming him. He said, "We have heard the saying, 'Where there is a will, there is a way.'" Now the Chinese people have a strong desire to build the Sino-Burmese friendship edifice. We, the Burmese people, like the Chinese people, have a strong desire to build the Sino-Burmese friendship edifice. Therefore, I firmly believe that we will be able to build a solid Sino-Burmese friendship edifice. Chairman U Nu's enthusiastic speech advocating Sino-Burmese friendship aroused storms of applause in the venue many times.

Zheng Zhenduo, President of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association, delivered a speech on behalf of all the directors and members of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association, warmly welcoming Chairman U Nu and thanking him for his efforts in promoting Sino-Burmese friendly cooperation. In his speech at the meeting, he said that Chairman U Nu has made outstanding contributions to maintaining Asian and world peace and is a close and beloved friend of the Chinese people. The mention of his name reminds us of the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of China and Burma more than two years ago, and the famous Five Principles. Chairman U Nu is now visiting China again as an envoy of Sino-Burmese friendship, which will write a new page in the history of the friendly relations between the people of China and Burma.

Zheng Zhenduo concluded by saying that as we gather here to welcome Chairman U Nu, we naturally recall the new developments in Sino-Burmese friendly relations in recent years, and at the same time, we look forward to the bright future of Sino-Burmese friendly cooperation with great joy. We can happily say that the traditional friendship between the Chinese people and the Burmese people will inevitably develop and consolidate more and more with the increase of years.

Chairman U Nu's wife, Daw Mya Yin, a judge of the Supreme Court of the Union of Burma, and her husband, Burmese Ambassador to China U Hla Maung and his wife, and other Burmese guests accompanying Chairman U Nu on his visit to China were invited to attend the welcoming rally.

Premier of the State Council and Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Zhou Enlai, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Chen Shutong, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and his wife, Chinese Ambassador to Burma Yao Zhongming, President of the Chinese Buddhist Association Xirao Jiacuo, directors of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association, heads of various people's organizations, and well-known figures from all walks of life attended the welcoming rally.

After the welcoming rally, Chairman U Nu and others attended a reception with Premier Zhou Enlai. At the reception, Chairman U Nu had cordial talks with the directors of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association and people who had visited Burma.

Following this, a Peking opera and dance evening was held. Chinese literary and art workers performed music, dances, and Peking opera for the Burmese guests and also performed Burmese dances. (Picture attached)

    吴努主席在欢迎大会上发表的讲话中强调指出，为了世界和平，中国、印度、缅甸三国所倡议的和平共处五项原则，不仅应该为这三个倡议国家所接受，而且应该为世界各国所接受。吴努主席说，和平共处五项原则是能使世界免于遭受非常可怕的灾难的五项原则。现在在全世界范围内，人们在制造各种武器，而且在大量制造能使全世界很大一部分地区化为灰烬的原子武器和氢武器。这种行动是促使非常恐怖的战争爆发的行动。因此，为了世界和平，我祝这五项原则获得包括中国、印度、缅甸三个倡议国家在内的全世界的支持。
    吴努主席在他讲话中首先感谢中缅友好协会对他的欢迎，他说，我们听说过这样一句俗话，“有志者事竟成”。现在中国人民有着强烈的愿望来建设中缅友好大厦。我们缅甸人民也同中国人民一样，有着强烈的愿望来建设中缅友好大厦。因此，我坚信我们一定能够建成巩固的中缅友好大厦，吴努主席的这些主张中缅友好的热情讲话，在会场内多次激起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    中缅友好协会会长郑振铎代表中缅友好协会全体理事和会员致词，热烈欢迎吴努主席，感谢他在促进中缅友好合作事业中所作的努力。他在大会上致词说，吴努主席对维护亚洲和世界和平有着卓越的贡献，是中国人民亲密的敬爱的朋友。一提起他的名字，就使我们想起两年多以前中缅两国总理的联合声明，就使我们想起著名的五项原则。吴努主席现在作为中缅友好的使者再次来到中国访问，将在中缅两国人民的友好关系史上又写下了新的一页。
    郑振铎最后说，现在当我们聚集在这里欢迎吴努主席的时候，很自然地就要回想起几年来中缅两国友好关系的新的发展，同时并怀着十分愉快的心情展望着中缅两国友好合作的光辉的未来。我们可以高兴地说，中国人民和缅甸人民之间的传统友谊必然会随着岁月的增进一天比一天地更加发展和巩固。
    吴努主席的夫人，缅甸联邦高级法院法官吴敏登和夫人，缅甸驻华大使吴拉茂和夫人和其他随同吴努主席访华的缅甸贵宾们应邀出席了欢迎大会。
