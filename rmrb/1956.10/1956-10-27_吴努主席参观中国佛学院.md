    吴努主席参观中国佛学院
    本报讯　缅甸联邦反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努及随行人员，昨天上午在北京参观了新近成立的中国佛学院。
    这所学院座落在有一千三百年历史的法源寺。
    吴努主席在佛学院副院长赵朴初和教务长周叔迦等陪同下走进了乙班教室。这时正果法师正在讲佛教的基本知识——佛法僧义。吴努主席参观后便走到讲台前向正果法师合十致意。他到了甲班教室，明真法师正在给学生们讲僧的戒律，吴努主席看了学员的笔记后又走到讲台前向明真法师合十致意。
    佛堂内香烟缭绕，佛像金碧辉煌。贵宾们在大雄宝殿内拜佛后，又参观了悯忠台、三学堂、玄奘纪念堂等。吴努主席还同佛学院院长喜饶嘉错大师讨论了佛教的教义。他建议两国之间互派佛教徒。他说：“我想你们可以派四个或五个中国佛教徒到缅甸去研究上座派教义。”
    今天吴努主席及随行人员由文化部副部长郑振铎、外交部礼宾司副司长王雨田等陪同还参观了北京舞蹈学校，受到全校师生们的热烈欢迎。
    贵宾们在排练室里观看了二年级学生的古典舞、三年级学生的巴蕾舞和六年级学生古典舞的基本动作练习。
    北京舞蹈学校的师生们还为贵宾们表演了去年才创作的民间舞“游春”和“拔萝卜”。同时还表演了曾在国外获得一等奖的鄂尔多斯舞、西班牙舞和苏沃罗夫舞等精采表演，贵宾们以极大的兴趣看了这些节目。
