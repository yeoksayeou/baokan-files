    Yunnan Province Actively Improves Urban Pork Supply Work

    (Our report) Yunnan Province is taking active measures to improve the tense situation of meat supply in the market. In the past six months, the non-staple food supply in some cities and industrial and mining areas of Yunnan Province has been very poor, and the supply of fresh meat has not been able to meet the needs of the masses for a long time. In the first quarter of this year, the Kunming market could still supply more than 350 pigs per day; in the second quarter, it could only supply about 100 pigs per day. The supply in industrial and mining areas such as Gejiu, Dongchuan, and Yimen was even less.

    In order to improve the tight supply of fresh meat, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has instructed commercial departments to not only vigorously organize the supply of other non-staple foods, but also fundamentally solve the problems of developing pig production and improving pig procurement. Now, the Yunnan Provincial Grain Department has decided to lower the price of bran and allocate 38.5 million catties of grain as pig feed. The Yunnan Provincial Food Company has increased the purchase price of live pigs by about 10%. Agricultural producers' cooperatives in various places are also taking measures such as "careful accounting" and "ideological communication" to mobilize members to actively raise pigs. In the work of live pig procurement, a combined contract of fixed purchase and fixed raising directly signed by the purchasing units and the agricultural cooperatives has been widely promoted; the purchasing units can also hire people with purchasing experience in the agricultural cooperatives as purchasing agents, and then give them a certain commission. This approach can make up for the shortcomings of the shortage of commercial staff affecting the purchase of live pigs.

### 云南省积极改进城市猪肉供应工作

    云南省积极改进城市猪肉供应工作
    本报讯　云南省采取积极措施，改进市场肉食供应的紧张状况。半年来，云南省一些城市、工矿区的副食品供应工作做得很差，鲜肉供应长期不能满足群众需要。今年第一季度，昆明市市场上每日还能供应猪三百五十多头；第二季度，每日只能供应一百头左右。在个旧、东川、易门等工矿区的供应量更少。
    为了改进鲜肉供应紧张的情况，中共云南省委已经指示商业部门，除大力组织其它副食品的供应外，必须从根本上解决发展生猪生产和改进生猪收购等工作。现在云南省粮食厅已经决定降低糠麸的价格，并且拨出三千八百五十万斤粮食作为猪饲料。云南省食品公司已提高生猪收购价格10％左右。各地农业生产合作社也正采取“算细账”、“通思想”的办法，动员社员积极养猪。在生猪收购工作中，广泛地推行了由采购单位直接同农业社订立定购、定养的结合合同；采购单位还可以在农业社里聘请有采购经验的人作代购员，然后给予一定的手续费。这种做法，可以弥补因为商业工作人员不足而影响生猪收购工作的缺点。
