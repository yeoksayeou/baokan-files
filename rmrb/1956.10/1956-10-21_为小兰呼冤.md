An Appeal for Justice for Xiaolan
Han Zi

The Liaoning Daily published a news report on October 10th about the suicide of a dear and lovable girl named Lan Peichu. Xiaolan is dead, leaving behind her two simple and humble suicide notes. Not a single word of "death" appears in them. How could Xiaolan, only nineteen years old, willingly die?! Her photograph was printed in the newspaper. She tilted her head childishly, and her beautiful eyes seemed to be asking people: How should young people live? One can imagine how difficult it was for her to leave this world! I implore people not to simply see her as a "weakling," but to first investigate the heinous behavior of those who drove her to her death.

The person who tormented her the most was her immediate supervisor, Liu Yunzhen, the head of the health section. Xiaolan inadvertently offended this section chief: because Xiaolan was busy caring for patients and didn't go to his house to give his child an injection. From then on, she was completely out of favor. At a plenary meeting of the health section, he criticized her for disobeying the doctor's leadership; he regarded her asking him how to fill out the "personnel registration form" as "taking the lead in creating trouble about status"; later, this became his reason for saying that Xiaolan could not be a model worker. When workers and union members who loved Xiaolan broke through his obstruction and insisted on electing her as an advanced worker at the factory level, he could refuse to talk about or report her model deeds, giving her a stimulus. These also became the reasons why she could not join the Youth League, and the basis for the Youth League group leaders to act according to the leader's wishes. Later, Xiaolan suffered the last and most serious blow. She cried all day, and Liu Yunzhen actually concocted the idea that her distress was due to being "pregnant" out of wedlock, sending people and personally taking action to force her to admit it, and snatching away her letter of accusation. Then, he announced that Xiaolan was "in a bad mood" and was not allowed to participate in the "May 1st" celebration. Such discrimination and such insults pronounced a death sentence on a young person. After Xiaolan's death, this Section Chief Liu did not spare her, busily proclaiming: Lan Peichu died of pregnancy (?). He even necropsied the deceased's uterus with morbid recklessness. Although no signs of pregnancy were found, he showed no sense of shame. It is such a cruel, heartless, despicable, and hateful Liu Yunzhen. Unfortunately, I cannot regard him as the only one. In their Liaoning Silk Weaving Factory, there is also his superior, Factory Director Liu Qian. When he first heard the news of Xiaolan's suicide, he didn't put down his chopsticks. Knowing that Xiaolan's rescue was ineffective, he didn't stop playing mahjong. At the repeated requests of Xiaolan's fiancé, he still allowed Xiaolan's body to be rained on in a leaky broken shed for a whole day and night. He really looked like a butcher who was used to seeing dead people. And also the big and small Liu Yunzhens hiding in every corner, maybe there are no corpses in front of you, but you are using your authority to put pressure on some young people, it can only be assumed that your so-called leadership intention is to train these young people into slaves; you seem to be used to other people's pain, turning a blind eye and remaining indifferent, may I ask why you lack such human compassion? I also want to ask: Where have the Party leaders in the factory gone?

Over the past year, Xiaolan's repeated serious setbacks in joining the Youth League were the most direct cause of her suicide. In our glorious era, how many young people have such kind and touching memories, as the Party and the Youth League's targets for development, the organization specifically sent comrades to help them, talk to them, give them something to read, assign them something to do; whether it was praise or criticism, it once made their hearts beat with joy… This is a very noble and pure relationship between people, this period is pregnant with happiness and ideals, they can feel that there is a warm hand pulling them forward. How much our poor Xiaolan longed for such assistance! But her application to join the Youth League was delayed for several months without anyone paying attention to it; and when she directly submitted her application to the factory's Youth League Committee, she was considered to be looking down on the branch; and Liu Yunzhen, who regarded her as an enemy, nonsense and wrongly accused her of making trouble about her position and not working with peace of mind, was so valued; time proved it for her, the Youth League group made its first appraisal of her to join the Youth League, saying that her advantages were that she was active and responsible in her work, able to overcome difficulties, work with peace of mind, and was well-received by the workers; she was good at cultural and professional studies, and often read political books; she abided by labor discipline, was not late or early, and lived a busy life; her thinking was simple, and she wanted to make progress… This is a portrait of our lovely Xiaolan, but the branch committee members rejected such a person, saying that a new branch committee would have to be formed to study it; after she was rated as an advanced worker, she was coldly discriminated against, and she submitted her fourth application to join the Youth League, hoping to get warmth within the Youth League, because it was first handed over to the Youth League Committee, this brought her disaster again, saying that she had violated the dignity of the Youth League branch secretary, and when she met this Youth League Committee Secretary Zhong Baohai, who could not distinguish between right and wrong, she listened to the false report of Group Leader Hou Defu, and instructed Hou Defu to confront her with her "shortcomings." So this Hou Defu grasped the leadership's intention of the Youth League and the administration (Liu Yunzhen), and closed his eyes and pieced together five "principled shortcomings" to Xiaolan: making trouble about position; disobeying organizational assignments; impure motives for joining the Youth League, not loyal; talking to leaders over the level; sleeping in the same room as her fiancé for one night. These inexplicable charges finally became her fatal blow. Difficult, difficult! How can you be reborn in the hands of these masters who occupy the Party and Youth League organizations and think that they have the power to decide people's political lives? They hide in this dark corner, acting as roadblocks and condemning judges. Therefore, there will be no such wonderful relationship between the organization and young people in their place. In the sacred cause of deciding to grant Party membership and Youth League membership, they desecrate the dignity of the organization and people, arbitrarily adding some dirty things, destroying this holy land of people's hearts. I am here to ask comrades to appeal for justice for Xiaolan and some young people who have similar experiences to her, to find out those cold, petty, selfish people and those numb, confused, and muddleheaded people, to criticize them, and not to allow them to run rampant! Let us resolutely eliminate the bureaucratic viruses within the body of our beautiful new society! Especially I implore comrades who are already Party members and Youth League members to support those who are opening their eyes and hoping for your help with more enthusiasm, welcome their small progress, and take their hands.

Xiaolan is dead, which makes us unable to calm down for a long time. In her suicide note to her fiancé, her magnificent last words are: Don't be sad, you are a young person, you should be brave. This is a thought-provoking last words. Let Xiaolan's death tell us: Be brave to be an upright person!
October 16th, midnight

    为小兰呼冤
    菡子
    十月十日的辽宁日报发表了一篇关于一个可亲可爱的姑娘自杀的消息，姑娘的名字叫兰培初。小兰死了，留下的是她两封朴素而谦虚的遗书。其中没有一个“死”字，十九岁的小兰，她何尝甘心去死？！报上登着她的照片，她稚气地偏着头，一双秀美的眼睛仿佛正向人们询问着：青年人应该怎么生活？可以设想离开这个世界在她有多么艰难！我祈求人们不要简单地把她看成“弱者”，应该首先追究的是那些逼死她的人们的恶劣行为。
    逼她最狠的人是她的顶头上司卫生科科长刘云振。小兰是偶然得罪了这位科长的：因为小兰忙着护理病人的时候没有到他家里给孩子打针，从此全不顺眼，在卫生科全体会议上批评她不服从大夫领导；把她向他请教“人员登记表”如何填法，看成“带头闹地位”；后来又成为他说小兰不能当模范的理由，热爱小兰的工人和工会委员冲破了他的阻拦，大家坚持评选为厂一级先进工作者时，他可以不讲、不报她的模范事迹，给她刺激；这些又都成为她不能入团的理由，和团小组长们看领导颜色办事的根据。后来小兰遭受最后一次也是最严重的打击，她终日哭泣，刘云振竟凭空想出她的苦恼是由于未婚的“怀孕”，遣人并亲自出马逼她承认，抢走她的控诉信；接着又宣布小兰“闹思想情绪”不准参加“五一”庆祝大会，这样的歧视和这样的侮辱宣判了一个青年的死刑，在小兰死后，这个刘科长也没有饶她，忙着声张：兰培初因怀孕而死（？），还丧心病狂地解剖了死者的子宫，虽然没有检查出怀孕的征兆，他也没有什么羞愧之意。就是这么残酷无情卑鄙可憎的刘云振，可惜我还不能把他看成仅有的一个。在他们辽宁绢纺工厂里，就还有一个他的上级刘谦厂长。他最初听到小兰自杀的消息可以不放下筷子；他知道小兰救治无效没有放下他的麻将；经小兰的未婚夫两次的请求，他可以仍让小兰的尸体在一个漏雨的破棚里淋了一天一宿。他真像一个屠夫似的看惯了死人。还有藏在各个角落里的大大小小的刘云振们，你们面前也许没有尸体，但是你们正以自己的权威，压着一些年青人，只能设想你们的所谓领导意图是想把这些年青人训练成奴才；你们仿佛看惯了别人的痛苦，见死不救，无动于衷，试问你们为什么这样缺少人类善良的同情心？我还要追问：厂里党的负责人上哪儿去了？
    一年来小兰在入团问题上历次遭受严重的打击，是促使她自杀最直接的原因。在我们光辉的时代，有多少年青人有过如此亲切动人的回忆，他们作为党、团的发展对象，组织专门派了同志帮助他们，谈话，给看一点什么，分配做一件什么事；不问是表扬或者批评，都曾经使他们喜悦得心跳…这是人们之间非常高尚和纯洁的关系，这段时期孕育着幸福和理想，他们可以感觉到有一只温暖的手在拉着他们前进。我们可怜的小兰多么企盼这样的援助！可是她的入团报告却被拖几个月无人理睬；而当她直接向工厂团委提出入团申请书时，又被认为瞧不起支部；而那个把她看作仇人的刘云振，胡说八道地冤枉她闹地位不安心工作，又如此被重视；时间替她作了证明，团小组第一次做了她的入团鉴定，说她的优点是工作积极负责能克服困难，工作安心，受到工人好评；文化业务学习好，并能常看政治书籍；遵守劳动纪律，不迟到，不早退，生活紧张；思想单纯，要求进步……这就是我们可爱的小兰的写照，可是支委们对这样的人却推说产生了新的支委才能研究；在她被评为先进工作者以后，受到冷漠的歧视，她递了第四次入团申请书，希望在团内得到温暖，因为是首先交给团委的，这又给她带来横祸，说她侵犯了团支书的尊严，碰到这位两眼漆黑是非不分的团委书记钟宝海，还在听了小组长侯德富的假汇报后，指示侯德富把她的“缺点”向她摊牌。于是这个侯德富摸到了团和行政（刘云振）的领导意图，眛煞良心，东拼西凑，向小兰提出五条“原则性的缺点”：闹地位；不服从组织分配；入团动机不纯，不忠实；越级找领导谈话；与未婚夫同屋睡觉一宿。这些莫名其妙的罪名终于成了她致命的打击。难呵，难呵！在这些霸据了党、团组织自认为对人们的政治生命有生死予夺之权的老爷们的手里，你怎么能够超生？他们躲在这阴暗的角落里，做挡路虎，当催命的判官，因此在他们那儿就不会出现组织与年青人之间的非常美妙的关系，在决定给予党籍和团籍的神圣的事业中，他们渎犯组织和人的尊严，任意加进去一些污七八糟的东西，捣毁这一块人们心灵的圣地。我在这里请求同志们为小兰和一些和她有类似遭遇的青年呼冤，把那些冷冰冰卑小自私的人和麻木不仁昏头昏脑的糊涂虫查出来，给他们指责，不准他们横行霸道！让我们坚决地清除我们美好的新社会肌体内的官僚主义的病毒吧！特别请求已经是党员和团员的同志，热情更热情地支援那些张着眼睛盼望你帮助的人们，欢迎他们微小的进步，拉起他们的手来。
    小兰死了，这使我们久久地不能平静。在给她未婚夫的遗书里，她的壮丽的遗言是：不要难过，你是青年人，应当勇敢。这是一句令人深思的遗言呵。让小兰之死告诉我们：勇敢地做一个正直的人吧！
