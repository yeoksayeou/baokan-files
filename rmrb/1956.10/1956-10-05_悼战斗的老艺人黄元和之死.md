    In Memory of Huang Yuanhe, a Veteran Performing Artist Who Fought
    Tian Han

      At half past two on the autumn night of September 20th, in room 401, on the fourth floor of the Xisi People's Hospital in Beijing, a common but bravely fighting heart stopped beating. It was the old Xiang opera artist Huang Yuanhe, whom the Ministry of Culture had brought from Changsha for medical treatment. He unfortunately passed away due to ineffective treatment for esophageal cancer. His fighting life explains why the Party and the government cared so much about him.

    Old Mr. Huang Yuanhe was sixty-six years old this year, a native of Changsha, and came from the old Sanyuan class of Changsha Xiang Opera. Famous old male actors like Ou Yuanxia and famous painted-face actor Luo Yuande were in the same class as him. He originally studied the role of the clown and had a thorough understanding of plays like "Playing the Flower Drum" and "Capturing the Third Son Alive." However, he had a wide range of interests, was diligent in his studies, and was proficient in all roles, including male, female, painted-face, and clown. He especially loved playing young male roles. In his later years, whenever there was an opportunity to play a young male role, he did not hesitate to sacrifice his beard. A few years ago, he also performed "Li Kui Makes Havoc on the River" as Zhang Shun with Luo Yuande. He also loved martial arts plays. In addition to the martial arts techniques inherent in Xiang opera, he also absorbed the strengths of Peking opera martial arts to enrich himself. Many male and female martial arts actors and martial artists in Hunan were trained by him. He got up very early every day and liked to go to the teahouse to eat some tea and snacks, and then returned to the stage to wait for his apprentices to practice. He was good at performing Zhang Bao before the horse in "The Biography of Yue Fei" and created many flips and fights to express Zhang Bao's loyalty and courage. Therefore, he had the nickname "Living Zhang Bao." He also understood stage management (opera music) and could play the drums.

    Mr. Huang ran the famous Fulu Opera School, which was all girls. Peng Fu'e, Long Fufeng, Yang Fugang, Zhang Fumei, etc., all came from this opera school. In the old society, people looked down on "actors," especially "female actors." Those rich and powerful guys tried to destroy and bully them in every possible way. In order to defend the sanctity of art education and women's professions, Mr. Huang bravely and resolutely fought against these evil forces. Even when his male and female apprentices were bullied by gangsters and local bullies when performing in other docks, as long as he knew about it, he would take his apprentices who dared to fight to protect them. With his integrity and determination to fight to the death, the gangsters were also afraid of him. This is how he fought against the evil forces of the old society, and he also left some pure artistic seeds in Hunan.

      Mr. Huang treated all students equally in the opera school. The opera school was divided into lines of responsibility. Some teachers did not care much about the apprentices outside of their responsibility, while Mr. Huang gave the same serious guidance to other people's apprentices. After liberation, when he was in the troupe, the younger generation was willing to practice under his supervision. After he left the troupe to go to the Xiang Opera Training Class, they seemed to be "scattered." However, he still did not lose contact with various troupes. He once took time to teach the Yilian Troupe the "cudgel" in "The Biography of Yue Fei." He not only cared about Xiang opera, but also taught cudgel skills to the Huaguxi Opera Troupe. Whenever he was invited to watch a performance by the younger generation, he always watched it enthusiastically and gave careful and straightforward opinions, often saying, "Kid, do it well, this play won't be too weak," encouraging people in every possible way.

    He was so enthusiastic in helping others. When the younger generation and apprentices were unemployed and had financial difficulties, he did his best to help them, repeatedly discussing with the troupe leaders to solve their work problems. Some people relapsed into old habits after they got employed, and the leaders were not satisfied. He hurried to persuade him, saying, "Brother, this opportunity is not easy to come by. You can't repeat the old mistakes." Many people were moved by his sincerity and corrected their faults.

    Mr. Huang was very open-minded politically and often encouraged people to strive for political progress. He encouraged the younger generation, saying, "You have to work hard. Look at me, an old man, and I'm not willing to fall behind."

    Mr. Huang was a patriot. I met him in the autumn of 1938, during the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan. We withdrew from Wuhan and ran a short-term drama actor training class in Changsha. Mr. Huang also participated in this class. After graduation, it was the night before the Changsha fire. We compiled ten Xiang opera propaganda teams, gave them some money, and asked them to go to various places to carry out anti-Japanese war propaganda. Mr. Huang led the Xiang Opera Propaganda Third Team and set off to work in Xiangtan, Hengyang, Leiyang, Chenzhou, and other places. Because the repertoire was realistic and technically strong, it was very popular among the people. However, like other teams, it was hated by the Kuomintang reactionaries and began to be oppressed by them. After returning to Changsha, he performed at the Xiang Opera Second Theatre at the old site of Tongchun Garden. Later, he organized the Jingjing Xiang Opera Society, the Qunli Xiang Opera Troupe, etc. After liberation, he led twenty young actors to participate in the Dongting Xiang Opera Troupe led by the military region, which is the predecessor of the current Hunan Xiang Opera Troupe. Mr. Huang contributed to the consolidation and development of this troupe.

    It was only in recent years that he was transferred from the Changsha Municipal Xiang Opera Troupe to the Xiang Opera Children's Training Class. He, together with Luo Yuande, Liao Yunsheng, Xiao Yingxiang, and others, enthusiastically engaged in the cultivation of the second generation of Xiang opera. This training class was not very well planned before, and it did not receive material support from the provincial leaders. They did not have costumes, or even basic stage equipment. When teaching plays, the teachers recited the percussion music and hummed the erhu interludes. This is how Mr. Huang taught his apprentices. When the students performed outside, Mr. Huang had to borrow costumes everywhere, invite stage managers, and even carry knives and guns himself. The students of the Xiang Opera Training Class went to Beijing with the Xiang Opera Troupe to perform, and even Chairman Mao watched their "Little General Hunting." This credit should be attributed to Mr. Huang and other teachers. It is said that the students developed some complacency after learning and did not listen to the teachers very much, which is very bad. We must learn from the old teachers better, learn their performance skills and their spirit of loving art.

    The life of an artist is generally very difficult. Mr. Huang's income (seventy yuan per month) mostly took care of some friends in need. He had only twenty yuan left on him when he passed away. The day he passed away was his sixty-sixth birthday, and he originally wanted to use the twenty yuan to treat his friends to a meal. Unexpectedly, his birthday became his memorial day.

    Mr. Huang has an old wife. They have three sons and three daughters. But his sons all passed away before him. His eldest son was named Bao'er. At first, he was disobedient and made the old man very sad. But later, he became a good helper, as if he had changed. When the troupe encountered great difficulties in a performance in Youxian County, Bao'er carried the troupe's luggage down the road to go to Hengyang, but was stopped by the hotel. In grief and anger, he committed suicide by taking poison. Mr. Huang originally hated this son, but after he "corrected himself," he loved and relied on this son very much. Therefore, Bao'er's death gave him great pain. He cried for his son very sadly, and he also hated the evil forces of the old society even more.

    The old saying goes, "Loyal and good people will not have no descendants." Mr. Huang left behind a grandson who is just five years old, named Duanwu, because he was born the day before the Dragon Boat Festival. I hope everyone will take care of this child and let him inherit his grandfather's career and noble character.

    悼战斗的老艺人黄元和之死
    田汉
      9月20日，北京的秋夜二时半，在西四人民医院四楼一室，一颗平凡的，但又勇敢地战斗过来的心停止跳动了。那是文化部从长沙接来就医的湘剧老艺人黄元和老先生因食道癌医治无效，不幸逝世了。他的战斗的一生说明了党和政府为什么那样关心他。
    黄元和老先生今年六十六岁，长沙人，系长沙湘剧老科班三元班出身；跟他同科的有名老生欧元霞，名净罗元德等。他原是学丑的，对
  “打花鼓”，“活捉三郎”等剧有精到的造诣。但他的兴趣宽，勤于钻研，生旦净丑无所不能，尤其爱演小生戏；到晚年，只要有演小生的机会，他不惜牺牲他的胡子，早几年，他还跟罗元德合演过“李逵闹江”里的张顺。他还爱武戏，除湘戏原有的武工之外，也吸收京剧武戏的长处来丰富自己；湖南一些男女武生和武行很少不是他培养出来的。他每天起得绝早，欢喜上茶馆去吃些茶点，然后回到剧场台上等着徒弟们来练工。他擅演“岳飞传”里的马前张保，创造了许多翻打来表现张保忠勇的性格，因此他有“活张保”的外号。他又懂场面（戏曲音乐），会打鼓。
    黄先生办过有名的福禄科班，科里全是女孩子。现在的彭福娥、龙福凤、杨福刚、张福梅等等都是这个科班出来的。旧社会看不起“戏子”，尤其是“女戏子”，那些有钱有势的家伙们多方破坏、欺侮她们。为着保卫艺术教育和妇女职业的神圣性，黄先生勇敢坚决地跟这些恶势力斗争。甚至男女徒弟们到外码头演戏受流氓地痞恶霸们欺侮时，只要他知道，他就带起敢于战斗的徒弟去那儿保护他们，凭着他那股子正气和舍死拼命的坚决态度，流氓也惧怕他三分。他就是这样跟旧社会的恶势力斗争过来的，也给湖南留下了一些纯正的艺术种子。
      黄先生在科班里对学生一视同仁。科班是分行负责的。有些先生对自己负责以外的徒弟就不大关心，而黄先生对别人的徒弟也一样认真地指点。解放后他在剧团的时候，青年一代都愿意在他的督励下练工，他离开剧团到湘剧训练班去了之后，他们就像“散了箍”。但他跟各剧团也还是没有失掉联系。他曾抽出时间到艺联剧团教他们“岳飞传”里的把子。他不只是关心湘剧，也曾替花鼓戏剧团教把子。后辈的演出只要请他看，他总是热心看到底，细心直率地提意见，每每说：“伢子，好好搞，这戏不会太弱”，多方鼓励人家。
    他就是那样热心帮助别人，后辈们、徒弟们有的失业生活困难，找他时，他无不尽力，再次三番去跟剧团负责人商量解决他的工作。有些人就了业之后老毛病又出来了，领导上不满意，他就赶忙去劝他，说：“老弟呀，这机会得来可不容易，旧毛病不能再犯哪。”许多人被他的诚恳态度感动了，把毛病改掉了。
    黄先生政治上很开朗，常劝人家争取政治进步。他鼓励后辈说：
  “你们要放紧搞啊，瞧我老朽还不肯落后哩。”
    黄先生是一个爱国者。我是在抗日战争初期的1938年秋天认识他的。我们从武汉退出，到长沙又办了一个短期的戏剧演员训练班。黄先生也参加了这个班。结业后已经是长沙大火前夜，我们编了十个湘剧宣传队，给了些钱，要他们到各地去展开抗战宣传。黄先生领的是湘剧宣传第三队，出发到湘潭、衡阳、耒阳、郴州一带工作，由于演出剧目的现实性和技术性颇强，很受人民欢迎；但也跟其他的队一样遭受国民党反动派的忌恨，开始受他们的压迫。回长沙后他在同春园旧址湘剧二场演出。后来组织精精湘剧社，群力湘剧团等。解放后又率青年演员二十来人参加军区领导的洞庭湘剧团，就是现在湖南湘剧团的前身。黄先生对这个剧团的巩固发展尽了一定力量。
    从长沙市湘剧一团调到湘剧幼年训练班是近几年的事。他跟罗元德、廖运生、萧迎祥等共同热心从事湘剧第二代的培养。这个训练班以前不是很有计划的，也没有得到省领导的物质支持。他们没有行头，甚至连起码的场面设备也没有。教戏的时候由先生嘴里念锣鼓经，哼胡琴过门。黄先生就是这样教徒弟的。学生对外演出时，黄先生得四出借行头，请场面，还自己背刀枪把子。湘剧训练班的学生随湘剧团到北京演出，他们的“小将军打猎”，甚至毛主席也看过。这一功劳应该归于黄先生和其他先生们。听说学生学回去就滋长了一些自满情绪，不大听先生的话，那就很不好。一定要更好地向老先生们学习，学习他们的表演技术和热爱艺术的精神。
    艺人生活一般是很艰苦的。黄先生的收入（每月七十元）大部分照顾了一些困难的朋友。他去世后身上还剩二十元。他去世那天正是他六十六岁的生日，他原想拿那二十元请朋友们吃一顿的。没想到他的生日成了忌日。
    黄先生有一位老妻。他们有三子三女。但他的儿子都先他去世了。他的长子叫宝儿，起先不听话，很使老人伤心。但后来，像换了一个人似的，成了他很好的帮手。剧团在攸县演出中遭受很大困难的时候，宝儿挑起剧团行头下路要到衡阳去，又被旅馆阻止，他悲愤之余，服毒自杀了。黄先生原恨他这儿子，及至他“归正”以后，又十分疼爱和倚靠这儿子，因而宝儿之死给了他极大的悲痛，他曾十分惨痛地哭他的儿子，因而也加倍地痛恨旧社会的罪恶势力。
    老话说“忠良不绝后”，黄先生留下了一个刚满五岁的小孙子，叫端午，因为是端午前一日生的。希望大家照顾这孩子，让他继承他祖父的事业和高贵品德。
