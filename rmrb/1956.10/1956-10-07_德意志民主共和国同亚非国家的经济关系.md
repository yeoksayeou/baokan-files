    Economic Relations Between the German Democratic Republic and Asian-African Countries
    By Ge·Weisi, Deputy Minister of Foreign and Domestic Trade of the German Democratic Republic
    The foreign trade policy of the German Democratic Republic is based on the principle of peaceful coexistence, and it is committed to developing extensive trade relations with countries around the world.
    Many Asian and African countries, after gaining national independence, are pursuing their own independent foreign trade policies. This policy is in line with the principle that peaceful coexistence between two world systems is possible. This situation provides a reliable basis for establishing mutually beneficial trade relations between the German Democratic Republic and India, Burma, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and other countries. The government of the German Democratic Republic attaches great importance to developing trade relations with these countries.
    Initially, trade with these countries was based on barter trade and payment in freely convertible currencies. However, this method could not meet the needs and possibilities of substantially increasing the exchange of goods. Due to the strong interest of Asian and African countries in importing machinery, industrial products, and consumer goods, and the desire of the German Democratic Republic to expand foreign trade relations by purchasing goods produced by these countries, it became necessary to establish normal trade relations, specifically, to sign bilateral or multilateral trade agreements.
    The first agreement signed by the German Democratic Republic with overseas capitalist countries was the trade and payment agreement concluded with the Egyptian government in 1953. Because the level of goods exchanged between the two countries at that time required the conclusion of an official agreement to promote further increases in trade. The conclusion of this agreement also ended the original situation that was vulnerable to fluctuations in the capitalist world market and was detrimental to both parties.
    Shortly after the signing of this agreement, the German Democratic Republic followed up with a series of official agreements with other Asian and African countries. From 1953 to 1955, the government of the German Democratic Republic successively concluded trade and payment agreements with the governments of India, Burma, Lebanon, Syria, and Sudan. In addition, agreements were also signed between the foreign trade organizations of the German Democratic Republic and Indonesia. In addition to short-term agreements with an average validity of one year, the German Democratic Republic also signed long-term trade agreements with Burma, Egypt, and Lebanon. Their validity period ranges from three to five years. From the perspective of the economic situation of these countries, the importance of such long-term trade agreements to their economies is very obvious, because the economies of these countries rely heavily on only a few products. For example, Egypt relies on cotton, and Burma relies on rice. The signing of such agreements provides reliable guarantees for the sale of agreed quantities of products for many years, and is less or no longer affected by the crises of the capitalist world market. In addition, the personal connections established among government officials and economic figures are extremely beneficial to expanding trade relations and establishing and consolidating friendly relations. This contact was mainly established by Heinrich Rau, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and Domestic Trade of the German Democratic Republic, during his visits to Asian and African countries. From 1955 to the beginning of 1956, he visited India, Burma, Sudan, Lebanon, and Egypt. Minister Rau not only discussed the issue of expanding the volume of goods exchanged with the government leaders of these countries, but more importantly, he discussed the issue of strengthening comprehensive economic and cultural cooperation. This visit made a great contribution to consolidating the friendly relations between the German Democratic Republic and these countries. On the other hand, representatives from Asian and African countries, especially Arab countries, also visited the German Democratic Republic. Ibrahim Mufti, Acting Prime Minister and Minister of Commerce, Industry and Supply of the Republic of Sudan, visited the German Democratic Republic.
    The Mayor of Cairo, Bindari, attended the celebration of the 750th anniversary of the founding of our famous city of Dresden. The Minister of Public Health of the Arab Republic of Egypt inspected the construction of public health services in the German Democratic Republic. During the Leipzig Spring Fair this year, well-known government officials from India, Egypt, Sudan, and Burma also visited the German Democratic Republic. All these visits demonstrate the common desire of these countries to develop international friendly relations on the basis of the principle of peaceful coexistence. On the other hand, this is also a testament to the growing international prestige of the German Democratic Republic and the trust placed in it by the aforementioned countries.
    The German Democratic Republic will continue to respond to the trust placed in it by various countries by providing first-class products. The German Democratic Republic is now exporting various industrial products, including complete sets of factory equipment and machinery, to Asian and African countries. The export of these products is a support for Asian and African countries to establish their own national industries, and also a contribution to these countries in the struggle to defend and consolidate national independence.
    The economic problems existing in Asian and African countries are diverse, and therefore the economic cooperation between our country and them also has various contents and forms. For example, in Sudan, the main problem is the supply of drinking water and irrigation water. A delegation of experts from the German Democratic Republic successfully found water sources in every arid region of western Sudan, although previous investigations by other foreign experts had yielded negative results. This example proves that the German Democratic Republic is willing and able to provide assistance even under extremely difficult conditions.
    The work of sending scientific and technical experts is closely linked to the development of foreign trade. At present, this work has been expanded to a large extent and has achieved success. Not long ago, a team of experts from our country studying the mining and processing of lignite arrived in India, and they made suggestions to India on the utilization and processing of lignite. Our expert delegation also went to Syria and Lebanon to discuss with the governments of these countries the establishment and development of education and health services.
    Asian and African countries can also make extensive contributions to international scientific and technological cooperation. For example, thanks to the facilities provided by Sudan and Egypt, the German Democratic Republic was able to test its manufactured motor vehicles and agricultural machinery under the special climate and soil conditions of these countries.
    As the role of international expositions in developing international trade continues to grow, the interest of various countries in holding exhibitions and participating in international expositions is also increasing. For example, India, Egypt, and Sudan participated in this year's Leipzig Spring Fair. The German Democratic Republic also participated in the international expositions held in New Delhi, India, and Damascus, Syria, last year, and our country will also participate in the Damascus International Exposition this year. In 1954, our country held the first industrial exhibition in Cairo, and the second industrial exhibition will be held there next year. The purpose of these exhibitions is to provide experts from various departments with a special opportunity to observe, and at the same time to show the national characteristics of our country to the people of various countries. The German Democratic Republic and Asian and African countries have used the form of exhibitions to develop scientific and technological cooperation, making the signed trade agreements not just a basis for engaging in import and export trade.
    There is the possibility of further expanding trade relations between the German Democratic Republic and Asian and African countries. The development of this trade relationship, as well as the increasing strengthening of cultural ties and scientific and technological cooperation between each other, is a powerful factor for the people of these countries in maintaining and consolidating the struggle for national independence, and an important contribution to defending world peace.

    德意志民主共和国同亚非国家的经济关系
    德意志民主共和国对外与国内贸易部副部长　格·魏斯
    德意志民主共和国的对外贸易政策是建立在和平共处的原则上的，它正致力于同世界各国发展广泛的贸易关系。
    许多亚非国家在获得了民族独立后，正奉行着它们独立的对外贸易政策。这种政策是合乎两个世界体系有可能和平共处这一原则的。这种情况为在德意志民主共和国与印度、缅甸、埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩和其他国家之间建立互利的贸易关系提供了可靠的基础。而德意志民主共和国政府是十分重视发展同这些国家的贸易关系的。
    起先，同这些国家的贸易是建立在以货易货和以自由外汇来支付的基础上的。但是，这种方式不能适应大量增加相互交换货物的需要和可能。由于亚非国家对进口机器、工业品、消费品的浓厚兴趣，和德意志民主共和国具有以购买这些国家出产的货物来扩大对外贸易关系的愿望，就有必要建立正常的贸易关系，具体地说，就是签订双边的或多边的贸易协定。
    德意志民主共和国和海外资本主义国家签订的第一个协定，是1953年同埃及政府缔结的贸易和支付协定。因为当时两国之间的货物交换量所达到的水平，要求缔结一项官方协定来促使贸易的进一步增加。这个协定的缔结，也结束了原来那种易受资本主义世界市场波动的影响和对双方不利的情况。
    在这个协定签订不久以后，德意志民主共和国紧跟着又同其他亚非国家缔结了一系列的官方协定。从1953年到1955年，德意志民主共和国政府同印度、缅甸、黎巴嫩、叙利亚和苏丹等国政府先后缔结了贸易和支付协定。此外，在德意志民主共和国和印度尼西亚的对外贸易机构之间也签订了协定。除了有效期平均为一年的短期协定外，德意志民主共和国还同缅甸、埃及和黎巴嫩签订了长期的贸易协定。它们的有效期从三年到五年不等。从这些国家的经济情况来看，像这样的长期贸易协定对它们的经济的重要性是很明显的，因为这些国家的经济在很大程度上只依靠某些少数的产品。例如，埃及是棉花，缅甸是大米。由于签订了这样的协定，就使得在销售议定数量的产品时得到了多年的可靠保证，而不再受到或少受资本主义世界市场的危机影响。此外，在政府官员和经济界人士中间所建立的个人联系，对扩大贸易关系、建立和巩固友好关系来说，也是极有好处的。这种接触主要是由德意志民主共和国副总理兼对外与国内贸易部部长海因里希·劳在访问亚非国家时所建立的。1955年到1956年初，他曾经访问了印度、缅甸、苏丹、黎巴嫩和埃及。劳部长同这些国家的政府领袖不仅讨论了有关扩大货物交换量的问题，而更重要的是讨论了有关加强全面的经济和文化关系的合作问题。这次访问对巩固德意志民主共和国同这些国家的友好关系是有很大贡献的。另一方面，亚非国家、特别是阿拉伯国家的代表人物也来到德意志民主共和国进行访问。苏丹共和国的代理总理兼工商供应部部长易卜拉欣·穆弗蒂就曾访问过德意志民主共和国。
    开罗市长宾达里曾参加了我国名城德累斯顿建城的七百五十周年庆祝典礼。埃及共和国的公共卫生部长考察了德意志民主共和国公共卫生事业的建设情况。今年举行来比锡春季博览会期间，印度、埃及、苏丹和缅甸等国的政府知名人士也访问了德意志民主共和国。所有这些访问，证明了这些国家都具有在和平共处原则的基础上发展国际友好关系的共同愿望。另一方面，这也是德意志民主共和国国际威信日益提高和上述各国对它的信任的证明。
    德意志民主共和国将继续以提供头等的产品的办法来回答各国对它的信任。现在德意志民主共和国向亚非国家输出着包括成套的工厂设备和机器装备在内的各种工业品。这些产品的输出，是对亚非国家建立自己民族工业的支持，也是对这些国家在保卫和巩固民族独立的斗争中的一项贡献。
    亚非国家中存在的经济问题是各种各样的，因此在我国同它们的经济合作中也具有各种不同的内容和形式。例如在苏丹主要是饮水和灌溉用水的供应问题。德意志民主共和国的一个专家代表团在苏丹西部的每个干旱地区成功地找到了水源，虽然以前其他外国专家调查的结果都是否定的。这个例子证明了德意志民主共和国愿意并且能够甚至在极困难的条件下提供援助。
    派遣科学和技术专家的工作是和对外贸易的发展紧密结合着的。目前这项工作已经扩大到了很大的范围，并且获得了成就。不久以前，我国的一个研究开采和处理褐煤的专家工作队曾到达了印度，他们在利用和处理褐煤方面向印度提出了建议。我国的专家代表团还到叙利亚和黎巴嫩同这些国家的政府讨论了建立和发展教育和卫生事业的问题。
    亚非国家对国际间的科学和技术合作也能作出广泛的贡献。例如，由于得到了苏丹和埃及提供的便利，德意志民主共和国能够在这些国家的特殊气候和土壤条件下试用它所制造出来的摩托车辆和农业机器。
    随着国际博览会对发展国际贸易的作用的不断增长，各国对举办展览会和参加国际博览会的兴趣也正在日益提高。例如印度、埃及和苏丹都曾参加了今年的来比锡春季博览会。德意志民主共和国也参加了去年在印度新德里和叙利亚大马士革举行的国际博览会，今年我国也将参加大马士革国际博览会。1954年，我国在开罗举办了第一次工业展览会，明年还将在那里举行第二次工业展览会。这些展览会的目的是为了给各部门的专家一个特殊的观察机会，同时向各国人民显示出我国的民族特征。德意志民主共和国和亚非国家利用展览会的形式发展了科学和技术的合作，而使得已签订的贸易协定不光是为了从事进出口贸易的一项基础。
    德意志民主共和国同亚非国家间的贸易关系能够有进一步扩大的可能。这种贸易关系的发展，以及相互之间的文化联系和科学技术合作的日益加强，是这些国家的人民在保持和巩固民族独立斗争中的一项有力因素，是对保卫世界和平的一项重要贡献。　（本报特约稿）
