    Indonesian Overseas Chinese Painting Exhibition Held in Beijing
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The "Indonesian Overseas Chinese Artists Delegation Exhibition", sponsored by the Chinese Artists Association, opened on the 17th at the Beihai Daoningzhai in Beijing. More than 140 works by ten painters are on display, including traditional Chinese paintings, oil paintings, watercolors, sketches, and a small number of woodcuts and copperplate engravings.
    The "Indonesian Overseas Chinese Artists Delegation" is composed of ten members of the "Indonesian Chinese Fine Arts Association" who returned to China for a visit. They have visited Beijing and the Northeast for sightseeing and sketching. The beautiful mountains and rivers of the motherland and the great achievements in various aspects of construction in recent years have greatly moved the painters. This feeling can be seen in many of the exhibited works.
    A preview of the exhibition was held on the morning of the 16th. More than 160 people from Beijing's literary and art circles and art circles visited the exhibition and had cordial conversations with the overseas Chinese painters. (Zhang Yilai)
