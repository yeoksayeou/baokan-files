Concentrating Dispersed Technical Strengths
Shanghai First Light Industry Bureau Organizes Technical Research Groups to Improve Product Quality

(Our dispatch) Shanghai First Light Industry Bureau has adopted the method of organizing technical research groups to improve the quality of daily-use industrial products, achieving good results. This method involves concentrating dispersed technical strengths for optimal utilization, enabling a few individuals to exert maximum effectiveness. Currently, 93 groups have been formed, comprising 830 participants, including engineers, technicians, experienced skilled workers, and technically proficient capitalists, forming a significant technical force on the industrial production front.

Since August, these groups have engaged in various activities, including organizing specialized technical research conferences, inspecting product quality, and promoting advanced experiences, thereby improving product quality. For example, this year, the main raw materials for toothbrushes, such as pig bristles and cow bones, have been in short supply. However, in toothbrush production, there is significant waste of cow bones, with a qualification rate of only 80%. Improving the qualification rate of toothbrush bone handles has become a key issue in production. The cow bone handle technical research group in this industry concentrated its efforts on experimenting with improved bone handle processing methods, eventually discovering a new degreasing method that raised the qualification rate of toothbrush bone handles to 93%.

Many technical groups in various industries have rapidly improved their technical level through the exchange of experiences. The confectionery industry's technical group exchanged the manufacturing experience of the famous Fulin Farm milk candy, extending the storage period of the candy. The wooden toy industry improved the paint formula, eliminating white spots on the paint surface. The ping-pong ball group exchanged the design of the expanded ball mold from the China Ping-Pong Ball Factory, increasing the qualification rate of ping-pong balls from 55% to 80%. In addition, many technical research groups in various industries have researched and promoted various raw material substitutes in response to the insufficient supply of raw materials in the second and third quarters, preventing production interruptions.

The technical research groups of the Shanghai First Light Industry Bureau were initially established by industry and by product. With the diversification of activities, the deepening of work, and the increasing technical requirements, the organizational forms have also changed accordingly. For example, in the printing industry, which has a large number of factories and a wide distribution in the city, technical research groups of similar nature were first established by central factories in different districts, and professional companies then established technical research groups by type of work or product. Industries with a single product and a certain technical foundation, such as fountain pen factories, established technical research groups for processes or parts. Industries with complex product varieties and a small number of enterprises, such as sports and recreational goods, established technical groups based on specific products. Some also established technical groups based on different uses according to the industry's customary division of labor. These different organizational forms are all designed to better suit practical needs and continuously improve product quality. (Tao Zishi)

    把分散的技术力量集中使用
    上海第一轻工业局组织技术研究小组提高了产品质量
    本报讯　上海市第一轻工业局采取组织技术研究小组的办法，提高日用工业品的质量，获得了良好效果。这个方法就是把分散的技术力量集中起来使用，使少数人发挥最大的效能。目前，共组成九十三个小组。参加小组的有：工程师、技术人员、有经验的技工和有技术的资本家共八百三十人，成为工业生产战线上一支重要的技术队伍。
    8月份以来，各小组开展了组织专题技术研究会，巡查产品质量，推广先进经验等多方面的活动，从而提高了产品质量。例如今年牙刷的主要原料猪鬃和牛骨，都显得紧张，但在牙刷生产中，牛骨浪费很大，合格率仅80％；提高牙刷骨柄的合格率，就成了生产上的关键问题。这个行业的牛骨柄技术研究小组，就集中力量进行改进骨柄处理方法的试验，最后找出了脱脂的新方法，使牙刷骨柄的合格率提高到93％。
    很多行业中的技术小组，通过交流经验，很快地提高了技术水平。糖果业的技术小组交流了有名的福利农场奶糖的制造经验，延长了糖果的贮藏期；木制玩具业改进了喷漆配方，消灭了漆面白点；乒乓球小组交流了中国乒乓球厂膨球模的设计，使乒乓球的合格率由55％提高到80％。还有不少行业中的技术研究小组在二、三季度原材料供应不足的情况下，研究和推广了各种原材料的代用品，使生产不致中断。
    上海市第一轻工业局的各技术研究小组，开始时是按行业、按产品建立的，随着活动的多样化，工作的深入，技术要求的提高，组织形式也就随着变化。例如厂户数多，市内分布面广的印刷工业，就采取了先按中心厂分区成立同类性质的技术研究小组，专业公司再按工种或产品成立技术研究小组；产品单一、已有一定技术基础的行业，如自来水笔工厂，则成立了工序的或零件的技术研究小组。产品品种复杂、企业数量不大的行业，如体育文娱用品等则建立了以具体产品为单位的技术小组；还有的则按行业的习惯分工而建立以不同用途分的技术小组。上述这些不同的组织形式都是为了更加适合实际的需要，使产品质量日益改进。　（陶子实）
