Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 11th: President Sukarno, accompanied by Shanghai Mayor Chen Yi, visited Sun Yat-sen's former residence this morning.

President Sukarno carefully viewed Sun Yat-sen's former reception room, dining room, study, bedroom, and garden. In 1912, Sun Yat-sen was forced to resign as Provisional President and retired to Shanghai, later living and working in this house. The furnishings here are now maintained in the original state from when Sun Yat-sen lived there.

In the reception room, President Sukarno lingered for a long time in front of an enlarged photograph of Sun Yat-sen taken on the first anniversary of his death. This photograph was taken on the "Yongfeng Warship."

President Sukarno visited the dining room of Sun Yat-sen's former residence. During the "May Fourth" Movement, Sun Yat-sen met with student representatives here.

While visiting the study, President Sukarno learned that Sun Yat-sen wrote works such as "The Fundamentals of National Reconstruction," "The Doctrine of Sun Yat-sen," and "The International Development of China" here. President Sukarno carefully examined the many books that Sun Yat-sen used at the time in the study.

President Sukarno stopped in front of a photograph of Soong Ching-ling, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, in her youth. President Sukarno said that he had seen this photograph in 1929 and collected it, but lost it when he was arrested. He hoped to have another copy of this photograph.

After President Sukarno visited the garden, the secretary of Vice-Chairman Soong Ching-ling presented gifts from Vice-Chairman Soong Ching-ling to President Sukarno. The gifts included a bronze statue of Sun Yat-sen, a memorial album of Sun Yat-sen's death, and a photograph of Sun Yat-sen and Soong Ching-ling's wedding. Among the gifts was a photograph of Vice-Chairman Soong Ching-ling in her youth, which was the photograph that President Sukarno had requested during the visit.

After visiting Sun Yat-sen's former residence, President Sukarno visited a department store in Shanghai.

This morning, President Sukarno's accompanying senior officials visited a shipyard and a textile factory, respectively.
