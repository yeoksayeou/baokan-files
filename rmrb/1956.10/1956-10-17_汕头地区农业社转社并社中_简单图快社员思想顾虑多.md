Xinhua News Agency, Shantou, October 14th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Man): Some counties in the Shantou Special District, Guangdong Province, are correcting the tendency of simplicity and speed in the work of upgrading and merging elementary agricultural cooperatives. This tendency began to surface in some areas of various counties when the work of upgrading and merging elementary cooperatives in this special district had just begun to unfold comprehensively.

The work of upgrading and merging agricultural cooperatives in this special district is being carried out on the basis of the basic realization of elementary agricultural collectivization. Some cadres leading this work believe that the cooperative members have gained a certain understanding of the benefits of advanced cooperatives through the education of facts such as the bumper harvest of early rice in the advanced cooperatives established earlier. However, they underestimated the adverse effects caused by issues such as the low valuation of cooperative members' personal mountains and forests, and fruit trees when joining the advanced cooperatives established this spring. Therefore, they regarded the upgrading and merging work as an easy task and adopted a simple and quick approach. According to reports from Jieyang, Huilai, Raoping, and Meixian counties, some district and township work teams in these counties rushed to mobilize cooperative members to sign up for upgrading or merging cooperatives as soon as they arrived in the countryside, without properly publicizing the policies for running advanced agricultural cooperatives. Some township cadres, seeing that some cooperative members were actively demanding upgrades, assumed that all cooperative members felt the same way. Therefore, they subjectively proposed to complete the upgrading and merging tasks in three or four days.

Because of the adoption of this simple and quick approach, the ideological concerns of cooperative members have not been resolved, and phenomena unfavorable to the development of production have occurred in some areas. Dabu County is a mountainous county with many mountains and forests. However, because cadres in many townships did not publicize the specific policies for mountain and forest entry into the cooperatives to the cooperative members, but generally publicized the superiority of advanced cooperatives, the cooperative members' concerns that they would suffer losses by entering their mountains and forests into the cooperatives were not resolved. Therefore, the phenomenon of indiscriminate logging of mountains and forests occurred throughout the county. Now, some counties have begun to pay attention to correcting this.

    汕头地区农业社转社并社中
    简单图快社员思想顾虑多
    新华社汕头14日电　新华社记者王曼报道：广东省汕头专区有些县纠正初级农业社升级并社工作中的简单图快倾向。这种倾向，在这个专区初级社升级并社工作刚刚全面铺开的时候，就在各县的部分地区开始露头了。
    这个专区的农业社升级并社工作，是在基本上实现初级农业合作化的基础上进行的。领导这个工作的部分干部认为，社员在早办的高级社已获得早稻丰收等事实教育下，对高级社的好处有了一定的认识，但对今春举办的高级社对社员入社山林、果树折价偏低等问题所造成的不良影响却估计不足，因此，他们就把升级并社工作看成是一件轻而易举的事情，采取了简单图快的做法。据揭阳、惠来、饶平、梅县等地的汇报，这些县份的一些区乡工作队刚刚到乡，还没有很好地宣传办高级农业社的政策，就急急忙忙发动社员报名升级或并社。有的乡干部，看到部分社员积极要求升级，就以为所有的社员都是如此，因此，主观地提出要在三、四天中完成升级并社的任务。
    因为采取这种简单图快的做法，社员的思想顾虑没有得到解决，部分地区就发生了不利于生产发展的现象。大埔县是一个多山的县份，山林很多，但是由于许多乡的干部不向社员宣传山林入社的具体政策，而是泛泛地宣传高级社的优越性，社员怕山林入社吃亏的思想没有解决，因而，全县就出现了乱砍山林的现象。现在，有些县已经开始注意纠正。
