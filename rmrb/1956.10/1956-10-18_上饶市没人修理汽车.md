    No One in Shangrao City Repairs Cars
    Shangrao City is a transportation hub for the three provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi. Originally, there were many handicraft businesses repairing cars and machinery. In January of this year, the city's machine repair industry formed a machine repair cooperative. This cooperative was not only responsible for manufacturing and repairing a large number of agricultural tools for agricultural production cooperatives, but also for maintaining and repairing vehicles for units such as the Shangrao Office of the Jiangxi Transportation Bureau and the Shangrao Office of the Fujian Transportation Company.
    In March of this year, according to a decision by the prefectural committee, this cooperative was transferred to the prefectural agricultural tool factory. However, the agricultural tool factory was only responsible for manufacturing agricultural tools. As a result, when some units' cars broke down, there was nowhere to repair them; some repair work at units such as the Shangrao Machine Depot also couldn't find anyone to do it. One factory had to buy its own lathe because a machine part was broken and there was nowhere to repair it. It was only used two or three times a month and was idle most of the time. The machine repair cooperative retained some machines, but they were not utilized for several months due to a lack of machinists. The Jiangxi Transportation Bureau took in some people from this machine repair cooperative, but some were transferred to Nanchang, Ji'an, and other places because they were not needed. The capital of some of the handicraftsmen in this cooperative has not been properly handled either. These problems need to be quickly resolved by the relevant departments.

    上饶市没人修理汽车
    上饶市是闽浙赣三省的交通要冲，原来有许多修理汽车、机器的手工业户。今年1月份，全市机器修造业组成了机器修造合作社。这个社不但要为农业生产合作社制造和修理大批农具，还要为江西运输局上饶办事处、福建运输公司上饶办事处等单位保养和修理汽车。
    今年3月间，这个社根据地委的决定，移交给了专区的农具工厂。但是，农具工厂只负责制造农具。结果，有些单位汽车坏了，没处修理；上饶机务段等单位有些修理活也找不到人做。有一个厂因为机件坏了没地方修理，只好自己买了一部车床，每月用两三次，大部分时间都闲着。这个机器修造合作社留了一部分机器，也因为缺少车工，好几个月没有利用。江西运输局从这个机器修造合作社接收了一部分人，因为用不了，有些被调往南昌、吉安等地。这个社的一些手工业者的资金，也没有得到适当的处理。这些问题，需要有关部门迅速设法解决。    　王仪熙
