Xinhua News Agency report:

    Shanghai's commercial departments will train more than 600 commercial workers suitable for various needs of emerging cities and industrial and mining areas in the fourth quarter. Among them, 250 are financial accounting personnel, and 380 are business personnel engaged in the operation of general merchandise and cotton cloth. They are all commercial workers from various industries in Shanghai who voluntarily applied to work in emerging cities and industrial and mining areas.
    The commercial personnel participating in the financial accounting professional training have all registered by October 4th. The Shanghai First Commercial Bureau has specially hired full-time teachers and counselors to enable them to become financial accounting personnel with a certain level of professional competence within three months. The commercial personnel participating in the general merchandise and cotton cloth business training have all registered by the end of last month and have been assigned to state-owned general merchandise and cotton cloth stores in Shanghai for internships. In three months, they will also become general merchandise and cotton cloth business personnel with specialized business knowledge and practical operational skills.
    This year, Shanghai's commercial departments have already transferred more than 6,700 commercial personnel to emerging cities and industrial and mining areas. Since the commercial personnel that Shanghai can transfer are not entirely suitable for the needs of various places, Shanghai's commercial departments have begun to pay attention to planned cultivation and training. Before the fourth quarter of this year, Shanghai had already systematically trained 384 statistical personnel and 382 financial accounting personnel for emerging cities and industrial and mining areas.

    上海市商业部门为新兴城市培养商业人员
    据新华社讯　上海市商业部门在第四季度内，将为新兴城市和工矿区训练六百多个适合各地需要的商业工作人员。其中有二百五十个是财务会计人员，有三百八十个是经营百货和棉布的业务人员。他们都是自愿申请到新兴城市和工矿区去工作的上海各行业的商业工作者。
    参加财务会计专业训练的商业人员，已经在10月4日全部报到。上海市第一商业局特地为他们聘请了专职教员和辅导员，三个月内可以使他们成为具有一定业务水平的财务会计人员。参加百货、棉布业务训练的商业人员，已经在上月底全部报到，并已被分配到上海市各国营百货、棉布商店中实习。他们在三个月以后，也将成为具有专门业务知识而又能实际操作的百货、棉布业务人员。
    上海市商业部门今年已经向新兴城市和工矿区输送了六千七百多个商业人员。由于上海可以抽调的商业人员并不完全适合各地的需要，因此上海商业部门开始注意有计划地进行培养训练。在今年第四季度以前，上海已经有计划地为新兴城市和工矿区训练了三百八十四个统计人员和三百八十二个财务会计人员。
