Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 2nd (TASS): The working people of Bulgaria are victoriously implementing the Second Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy, which lasts until 1957.

Now, Bulgaria has begun drafting a three-year long-term plan for developing the national economy from 1958 to 1960. This plan will be coordinated with the economic development plans of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.

The new plan will enable Bulgaria to take a big step forward on the road of socialist construction. Its basic task is to ensure the further industrialization of the country, while also ensuring the corresponding development of agriculture. The plan stipulates further improvements in the material welfare and cultural level of the people.

The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Council of Ministers called on the leaders of enterprises and all employees, as well as Party organizations and social groups, to actively participate in drafting long-term development plans for enterprises.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 10th: The sixth open-hearth furnace of the Lenin Iron and Steel Combine in Nowa Huta, Poland, has been put into operation a few days ago. From now on, this combine will become the largest steelmaking enterprise in Poland.

According to the Five-Year Plan, this enterprise will produce 1.8 million tons of steel annually by 1960.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th: According to Soviet newspaper reports, in the first eleven months of the 1955-1956 livestock year (October 1, 1955 - September 30, 1956), the number of dairy cows in Soviet collective farms has increased by 436,000, and the total milk production has increased by 38%.

The milk production of many collective farms has even increased by one or two times, reaching the level stipulated in the new Five-Year Plan for 1960.

Throughout the Soviet Union, the milk yield of dairy cows in almost all collective farms has greatly increased. During the same period, the average milk yield per dairy cow in collective farms was 353 kilograms more than in the same period of the previous year. In Ukraine, Moldova, and twelve states of the Russian Federation, the average milk yield per dairy cow in collective farms is now more than 2,000 kilograms. In Nikolayev, Dnepropetrovsk, Kherson, and other states, the average milk yield per dairy cow is even 2,400 to 2,800 kilograms.

The editorial of "Agricultural Newspaper" on September 23 pointed out that the sharp increase in the productivity of dairy cow products in most areas of the Soviet Union shows that the task of doubling milk production as stipulated in the new Five-Year Plan can be completed in two, or at most three, years.

As a result of the increase in milk production, the Soviet collective farms have already overfulfilled the annual plan for delivering and selling milk to the state for the whole year by September 10. They supplied the state with two million tons more milk than in the same period of the previous year.

Our Newspaper: Romania's first experimental atomic reactor will be completed in the coming months at the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Romanian Academy of Sciences. This atomic reactor is being built with nuclear materials, equipment, and technical assistance provided by the Soviet Union.

This atomic reactor will be used for basic research in nuclear physics and for the production of radioactive isotopes for research and practical applications. It will also create better conditions for training Romanian nuclear physics experts. In addition, Romanian scientists and technicians are also building an electrostatic accelerator and an experimental atomic induction accelerator. A modern and powerful linear accelerator is also being designed.

    苏联和人民民主国家的经济建设
    保加利亚开始草拟三年计划
    新华社讯　塔斯社索非亚2日电：保加利亚劳动人民在胜利地执行着到1957年为止的发展国民经济的第二个五年计划。
    现在，保加利亚已经开始起草1958年到1960年发展国民经济的三年远景计划，这个计划将同苏联和人民民主国家经济发展的计划取得协调。
    新计划将使保加利亚在社会主义建设的道路上迈进一大步。它的基本任务是保证国家的进一步工业化，同时也保证农业的相应发展。计划规定进一步提高人民的物质福利和文化水平。
    保加利亚共产党中央委员会和部长会议号召各企业的领导人和全体员工以及党组织和社会团体积极参加草拟发展企业的远景规划的工作。
    波兰列宁冶金联合企业第六座平炉投入生产
    新华社华沙10日电　波兰诺瓦胡塔的列宁冶金联合企业第六座平炉已经在几天前投入生产。从此以后，这个联合企业就成为波兰炼钢能力最大的企业。
    根据五年计划规定，这个企业到1960年将年产一百八十万吨钢。
    苏联集体农庄牛奶产量不断提高
    新华社莫斯科10日电　据苏联报纸消息：在1955—1956畜牧业年度（1955年10月1日—1956年9月30日）的前十一个月中，苏联集体农庄的奶牛已经增加了四十三万六千头，牛奶总产量增加了38％。
    许多集体农庄的牛奶生产甚至增加了一两倍，达到新五年计划规定的1960年的水平。
    在苏联全国各地，几乎所有的集体农庄的奶牛出奶量都大大提高了。在同一期间，集体农庄每头奶牛的平均出奶量比上一年度同期多三百五十三公斤。在乌克兰和摩尔达维亚共和国以及俄罗斯联邦的十二个州，集体农庄每头奶牛现在平均已经出产了两千多公斤奶，而在尼古拉耶夫、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克、刻松等州，每头奶牛甚至出了两千四百到两千八百公斤牛奶。
    “农业报”9月23日的社论指出：苏联大多数地区奶牛产品生产率的急剧提高说明，新五年计划规定的增产牛奶一倍的任务，是可以在两年、最多三年内完成的。
    由于牛奶生产增加的结果，苏联集体农庄今年向国家交售和出售牛奶的全年计划已经在9月10日提前超额完成了。它们为国家供应的牛奶比上一年度同期多两百万吨。
    罗第一个原子反应堆就要建成
    本报讯　罗马尼亚的第一个实验性原子反应堆，将在最近几个月内在罗马尼亚科学院的核子物理研究所里建造完成。这个原子反应堆是在苏联提供核子原料、装备和技术援助的情况下建设的。
    这个原子反应堆将用来进行核子物理学的一些基本研究工作，并为研究和实际应用的目的而生产一些放射性同位素。它也将为训练罗马尼亚的核子物理专家创造更好的条件。另外，罗马尼亚的科学技术人员还正在建造一个静电学的加速器和一个实验性的原子感应加速运动器。同时还在设计一个现代化的强力的直线加速器。
