Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 10th – Professor Chebotarev of the Theoretical Astronomy Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences told a "Labor Newspaper" reporter that, after careful research, he and his colleagues have further concluded that it is entirely possible for rockets to fly to the moon and back to Earth without fuel. The ability to fly without fuel will greatly reduce the weight of the rocket, so that it will not exceed forty to fifty kilograms.

Previously, when studying interstellar flight plans, scientists from various countries always considered the issue of multi-stage rockets. It was generally believed that one of the main difficulties for a rocket flying to the moon was the large amount of fuel it needed throughout the flight. This caused the weight of the rocket to reach tens of tons before launch.

Professor Chebotarev said that launching a rocket without any fuel would only require an initial impulse to lift the rocket off the ground and overcome the Earth's gravity. After that, the rocket will rely on inertia and the force of gravity to orbit the moon along a specific trajectory and then fly back. To prevent the rocket from being damaged when it reaches the ground, it must be equipped with an automatically controlled parachute, which can automatically open when it reaches a predetermined altitude. According to this calculation, the maximum distance of the rocket from the Earth after leaving the Earth can reach 416,000 kilometers. The entire flight will take about ten days.

The rocket will be equipped with radio transmitters and photographic equipment, which can photograph the surface of the moon at close range, especially the side of the moon that cannot be seen from Earth.

### 苏联的科学家得出结论：  火箭不带燃料也能够飞向月球再回来

    苏联的科学家得出结论：
    火箭不带燃料也能够飞向月球再回来
    新华社莫斯科10日电　苏联科学院天文学理论研究所的契博塔列夫教授对“劳动报”记者说，经过仔细研究以后，他和他的同事们进一步得出结论：火箭不带燃料是完全有可能飞向月球，然后再飞回地球的。不带燃料而能够飞行，这将大大减少火箭的重量，使它可以不超过四十到五十公斤。
    在这以前，各国科学家在研究星际飞行的方案时，总是考虑到利用多段火箭的问题。大家认为，火箭飞往月球的主要困难之一在于它在整个飞行过程中都需要大量的燃料。这使火箭的重量在发射以前达到几十吨。
    契博塔列夫教授说，在完全不带燃料的情况下发射火箭，这在开始的时候只需要一种冲力，使火箭能够离开地面并且克服地球的引力就行了。在这以后，火箭将依靠惯性和万有引力的作用循着一定的轨道绕月球飞行，然后再飞回来。为了使火箭在飞到地面时不至于碰坏，必须在它上面装备自动操纵的降落伞，这种降落伞在达到预定的高度时可以自动张开。按照这种计算，火箭离开地球后同地球最大的距离可以达到四十一万六千公里。整个飞行约需十天。
    火箭上将装有无线电发射机和摄影装置，这些摄影装置将可以在最近的距离内把月球的表面，特别是地球上看不到的月球那一面的情况拍摄下来。
