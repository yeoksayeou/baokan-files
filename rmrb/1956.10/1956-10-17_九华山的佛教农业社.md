    Buddhist Agricultural Cooperative in Jiuhua Mountain
    During the agricultural cooperation upsurge last winter, the monks and nuns on Jiuhua Mountain in Qingyang County, Anhui Province, voluntarily formed the "Jiuhua Mountain Buddhist Agricultural Production Cooperative." A total of one hundred and thirty-seven monks and nuns (including seventy-two nuns) joined the cooperative, accounting for 83.5% of all monks and nuns on the mountain, cultivating seventy-eight mu and four fen of paddy fields, dry land, *huo geng* land, and tea plantations.

    After joining the cooperative, these monks and nuns, under the principle of maintaining a good Buddhist life, actively engaged in labor and production, breaking away from the "three dependencies" mentality of relying on incense income, foreign remittances, and government relief, striving to be self-reliant religious practitioners.

    Because of their active participation in labor, the cooperative's agriculture and sideline businesses are doing very well. For example, before joining the cooperative, the sixty-six-year-old nun Ben Jing lived a very difficult life due to her old age and weakness, often not even having money to buy oil; now, she not only lives a very wealthy life, but has also saved fifty-two yuan in the cooperative.

    九华山的佛教农业社
    安徽省青阳县九华山上的僧尼，在去冬农业合作化高潮中，自愿组成了“九华山佛教农业生产合作社”。入社僧尼共一百三十七人（其中尼姑七十二人），占全山僧尼的83.5％，耕种着七十八亩四分水田、旱地、火?地和茶地。
    这些僧尼入社以后，在过好佛教生活的原则下，都积极从事劳动生产，打破了靠香火收入、靠外汇、靠政府救济的“三靠思想”，争取做一个自食其力的宗教职业者。
    由于他们积极参加劳动，社里的农业、副业都搞得很好。如六十六岁的尼姑本静在未入社前，由于年老体弱生活十分困难，常常连买油的钱也没有；现在，不仅生活过得很富裕，而且还在社里存了五十二元钱。　吴万根
