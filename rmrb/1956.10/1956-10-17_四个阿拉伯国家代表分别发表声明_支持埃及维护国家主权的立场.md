Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 15th: The Lebanese representative to the United Nations issued a statement on October 14th, supporting Egypt's position in the Security Council in defending its national sovereignty.

    The representatives of Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen also issued similar statements on the evening of the 13th. The statement issued by the Lebanese representative to the United Nations stated that Lebanon is concerned about the Suez dispute, not only because Lebanon's relationship with Egypt is as close as brothers, and any major issue affecting Egypt will inevitably affect Lebanon, but also because Lebanon is uneasy about the concentration of British and French troops in Cyprus, which constitutes a direct threat to Lebanon.

    The statement concluded that if the Suez issue is to be resolved peacefully, Western countries must change their past practices.

    四个阿拉伯国家代表分别发表声明
    支持埃及维护国家主权的立场
    据新华社15日讯　纽约消息：黎巴嫩驻联合国代表10月14日发表声明，支持埃及在安全理事会上采取的维护国家主权的立场。
    叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和也门三国代表在13日晚上也分别发表了类似的声明。黎巴嫩驻联合国代表发表的声明说，黎巴嫩对苏伊士纠纷表示关怀，这不但因为黎巴嫩和埃及的关系像兄弟般那样密切，任何影响埃及的重大问题必然影响到黎巴嫩，而且还由于黎巴嫩对英法两国在塞浦路斯集结军队感到不安，这种集结构成了对黎巴嫩的直接威胁。
    声明最后指出，如果要和平解决苏伊士问题，西方国家必须改变过去的作法。
