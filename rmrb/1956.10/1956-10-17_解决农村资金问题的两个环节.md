    In the process of developing agricultural production and realizing agricultural collectivization, state agricultural loan assistance is a very important task. From 1950 to 1955, the total amount of agricultural loans issued by the state was 4.8 billion yuan, with an average of about 1 billion yuan circulating in rural areas each year, which played a certain role in solving farmers' production and living difficulties and supporting agricultural mutual aid and cooperation. Since the agricultural collectivization movement entered its climax in the second half of last year, agricultural loans increased by 2.2 billion yuan in 1956. These loans were mainly used to provide cooperative fund loans to poor peasants and production loans to agricultural cooperatives to support poor peasants joining cooperatives and solve the funding difficulties of agricultural cooperatives in carrying out increased production measures.

    The main task of rural work in the future is to continue to consolidate and improve existing agricultural cooperatives, mobilize all positive factors, and comprehensively develop agricultural production. The main task of rural financial work is to cooperate with the completion of this task in terms of capital turnover. In order to solve the rural funding problems in the future, in addition to agricultural cooperatives conscientiously implementing the central government's policy of running cooperatives diligently and frugally and relying more on their own accumulated funds, the following two problems must also be solved.

    Appropriately stipulate the amount of national agricultural loans and use agricultural loan funds more rationally.

    In the future, agricultural cooperatives will need a large amount of investment to expand production increase measures, such as building farmland water conservancy projects on a large scale, improving animal-powered farm tools, increasing transportation tools, and building warehouses and sheds. Most of these investments cannot be recovered in the current year, and the state needs to provide a certain amount of long-term loans. At the same time, before the production of agricultural cooperatives has been greatly developed, some members and a few farmers who have not yet joined agricultural cooperatives will still have certain difficulties in production and life. If we do not provide necessary assistance to these difficulties, it will be detrimental to the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives and the comprehensive development of production. These situations show that in the future, it is necessary for the state to appropriately increase the number of loans issued each year on the basis of the original loans. However, the increase in state loans should not be too large. The proportion of increase each year in the future must not be as large as it was this year. Because the state's financial strength is limited, it is impossible to invest too much in this area. In view of the increasing number of agricultural loans and the increasing proportion of long-term loans, in order to ensure the stability and reliability of the national budget and the balance of the state's cash revenue and expenditure plan, when preparing the national budget in the future, it is necessary to further consider the balance between the budget and credit, or directly incorporate the long-term loan portion of agricultural loans into the national budget.

    The rational use of agricultural loan funds is an extremely important issue in agricultural loan work. If loans are used properly, they can help agricultural cooperatives, members, and individual farmers solve difficulties and develop production; conversely, if loans are used improperly and are too generous, it will also encourage agricultural cooperatives to be extravagant and wasteful and cause dissatisfaction among members. This spring, some places had this tendency when issuing loans. Of course, there were also some places that did not provide timely loan assistance to members and individual farmers who were indeed in difficulty. In the future, in order to use agricultural loan funds more rationally, we must take the initiative to help agricultural cooperatives make careful calculations and use loans in the most needed areas. Necessary loans should be appropriately satisfied; unnecessary or not currently needed loans should be persuaded to the masses not to borrow or postpone borrowing.

    Loans must adhere to the principle of "borrowing and repaying." This principle cannot be shaken, because only by constantly recovering the loans issued on time, so that agricultural loans can circulate normally, can the state maintain and increase agricultural loan funds, so that more agricultural cooperatives and agricultural cooperative members and individual farmers in difficulty can get timely help. In the past, the fairly common phenomenon of only paying attention to lending and not caring about recovery was not good. Attention should also be paid to preventing and correcting certain practices that disregard production conditions and the actual difficulties of borrowers and mechanically force the recovery of loans.

    Run rural credit cooperatives well, widely organize idle rural funds, and adjust the needs of agricultural funds.

    Now there are 110,000 credit cooperatives across the country, basically realizing the principle of "one cooperative per township" instructed by the Party Central Committee. The deposits and shares absorbed by these credit cooperatives have reached 800 million yuan. Loans frequently issued amount to 700-800 million yuan. Most of the loans from credit cooperatives are short-term, but they can help the masses solve difficulties in a timely manner and are very popular among the masses. Most of the existing credit cooperatives are new cooperatives established in the last year or two. According to the development of old cooperatives, in general areas, after two or three years of work, the annual deposits and loans of each cooperative can generally reach more than 20,000 yuan. In the next few years, if the work is done well, the annual deposits of credit cooperatives will have a huge increase compared to now, which will be a very important force in solving rural funding needs. The key to the problem in the future lies in strengthening the leadership of the Party and the state over credit cooperatives. We must continuously educate cadres to improve their work style and methods; we must adhere to the principles of voluntary deposit, free withdrawal, and keeping secrets for depositors. In the past, there was an idea that credit cooperatives would not be needed after collectivization, and they could be merged into the credit departments of agricultural cooperatives, or changed into bank agencies. According to the situation in the past year, this idea is wrong. Now farmers are worried about exposing their wealth and production cooperatives mobilizing them to buy shares. If the credit cooperative is combined with the agricultural cooperative, this worry of farmers will be even more increased, which is detrimental to the mobilization of idle rural funds. From the perspective of leadership strength, this may divert the attention of agricultural cooperative cadres from leading production, or weaken rural credit activities because the leadership strength of agricultural cooperatives is mainly placed on production. Credit cooperatives are organized by farmers themselves through joint stock, and this organizational form is convenient for contacting the broad masses and accepting the supervision of the masses. If the credit cooperative is changed into a township bank, it will weaken the close ties between the current credit cooperative and the broad masses. Therefore, I believe that in a considerable period after agricultural collectivization, credit cooperatives still have an important role to play and should be allowed to continue to exist and play a role. In order to promote the smooth development of credit cooperative work, there should be an appropriate number of full-time cadres. The remuneration issue of credit cooperative cadres should be appropriately resolved. The state should use various methods to help it develop its business, so that credit cooperatives can strive to gradually achieve self-sufficiency in expenditures in the next few years. Before self-sufficiency can be achieved, temporary subsidies can be considered for some loss-making credit cooperatives to solve the temporary difficulties of credit cooperatives.

    We believe that if these problems can be solved well, rural financial work can play a greater role in consolidating the agricultural production cooperative system, comprehensively developing agricultural production, and completely eliminating rural usury exploitation.

    解决农村资金问题的两个环节
    中国人民银行行长　曹菊如
    在发展农业生产和实现农业合作化的过程中，国家对农业的贷款援助是一项很重要的工作。从1950年到1955年，国家先后发放的农业贷款累计数字共为四十八亿元，平均每年约有十亿元左右的贷款在农村中周转，这对于解决农民生产和生活困难，支持农业互助合作起了一定的作用。自从去年下半年农业合作化运动进入高潮以来，1956年农业贷款增加了二十二亿元，这些贷款主要用于发放贫农合作基金贷款和农业社生产贷款，以支持贫农入社，解决农业社进行增产措施的资金困难。
    今后农村工作的主要任务是继续巩固和提高现有的农业社，调动一切积极因素，全面地发展农业生产。农村金融工作的主要任务，就是要从资金周转方面去配合这个任务的完成。为了解决今后的农村资金问题，除了农业社应当认真贯彻中央勤俭办社的方针，更多地依靠自己积累资金以外，还必须解决以下两个问题。
    适当地规定国家农业贷款的数额，更加合理地运用农业贷款资金。
    今后农业社为了扩大增产措施，比如大量兴办农田水利，改良畜力农具，增加交通运输工具和修建仓房棚圈等，都是需要大量投资的，这些投资大部分不能当年收回，还需要国家有一定数额的期限较长的贷款。同时在农业社的生产还没有很大发展以前，若干社员以及少数还没有加入农业社的农民在生产和生活方面还会有一定的困难，如果对他们的这些困难，不给予必要的帮助，是不利于农业社的巩固和生产的全面发展的。这些情况说明，在今后一个时期内，国家每年在原有贷款的基数上再适当增发若干贷款是必要的。但是国家贷款的增加不能过大，今后每年增加的比例，绝不能像今年一样增加那么多。因为国家的财政力量有限，不可能在这方面投资过多。鉴于农业贷款的数字越来越大，长期贷款的比重越来越增加，为了确保国家预算的稳妥可靠和国家现金收支计划的平衡，在今后编制国家预算时，要更进一步切实考虑预算和信贷的平衡，或将农业贷款中的长期贷款部分直接纳入国家预算。
    合理地使用农贷资金是农业贷款工作中的一个极为重要的问题。贷款使用得得当，可以帮助农业社、社员和个体农民解决困难，发展生产；反之，贷款使用不当，掌握偏宽，也会助长农业社铺张浪费，引起社员不满。今年春季有些地方在发放贷款时曾经有过这种偏向的。当然也有些地方对确实困难的社员和个体农户，没有及时贷款帮助。今后为了更加合理地使用农贷资金，必须主动地帮助农业社精打细算，把贷款用在最需要的方面。必要的贷款应该适当予以满足；不必要的或者不是当前必需的，应该说服群众，不贷或者缓贷。
    贷款必须坚持“有借有还”的原则。这一条是不能动摇的，因为只有不断地把放出去的贷款按期收回，使农贷能够正常周转，国家才有可能保持和增加农贷资金，使更多的农业社和有困难的农业社员和个体农民得到及时的帮助。过去相当普遍地存在着的只注意贷放不关心收回的现象是不好的。对某些不顾生产情况、不问贷款者的实际困难，机械地强迫收回贷款的作法也应该注意防止和纠正。
    办好农村信用合作社，广泛组织农村闲散资金，调剂农业资金的需要。
    现在全国已经有十一万个信用社，基本上实现了党中央指示的“一乡一社”的原则。这批信用社所吸收的存款和股金已经有八亿元。经常放出的贷款有七、八亿元。信用社的贷款大部分虽是短期的，但它能及时帮助群众解决困难，很受群众欢迎。现有的信用社绝大部分都是最近一、二年内建立起来的新社。按老社的发展情况看，在一般地区，经过两三年的工作，每个社常年的存款和贷款一般可以达两万元以上。在今后的几年内，如果工作做好了，信用社的常年存款将会比现在有巨大的增长，这将是解决农村资金需要的一个很重要的力量。今后问题的关键，在于加强党和国家对信用社的领导。要不断地教育干部改善工作作风和工作方法；要坚持存款自愿、取款自由、为存户保守秘密的原则。过去有一种想法：认为合作化以后信用社就不需要了，可以把它合并为农业社的信用部，或者改为银行的机构。根据一年来的情况看，这种想法是不对的。现在农民有怕露富怕生产社动员入股的顾虑，如果信用社同农业社合而为一，将要更加增加农民的这种顾虑，这对于农村闲散资金的动员是不利的。从领导力量的角度看，这样作就可能分散农业社干部领导生产的注意力，或者是因为农业社的领导力量主要放在生产方面而削弱了农村信用活动。信用合作社是农民自己合股组织起来的，这种组织形式便于联系广大群众，接受群众的监督。如果把信用社改为乡银行，将会削弱现在信用社同广大群众的密切联系。因此，我认为在农业合作化以后的相当长时期内，信用社仍然是有重要作用的，应该让它继续存在和发挥作用。为了促进信用社工作的顺利发展，应该有适当数量的脱产干部。信用社干部的待遇问题应该得到适当的解决。国家要用各种办法帮助它开展业务，使信用社能够争取在今后几年内，逐渐达到开支自给。在未能自给以前，对于部分亏损的信用社，可以考虑给予一定的临时补贴，解决信用社暂时的困难。
    我们相信如果这些问题能解决得好，就可以使农村金融工作在巩固农业生产合作制度、全面发展农业生产、彻底消灭农村高利贷剥削方面，发挥更大的作用。
