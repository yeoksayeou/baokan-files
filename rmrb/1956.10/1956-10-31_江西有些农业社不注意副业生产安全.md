Jiangxi Some Agricultural Cooperatives Do Not Pay Attention to Safety in Sideline Production

(Our newspaper's Nanchang dispatch) Some agricultural cooperatives in Jiangxi Province have neglected safety in developing sideline production, resulting in numerous casualties. In Jishui County, four consecutive accidents involving death and injury occurred (one death, three injuries). A cooperative member named Zhang Weijie in the county was killed by a tree while chopping wood for charcoal burning. Yao Xingde of Yaojia Village was pierced in the abdomen while cutting bamboo and has been sent to the hospital for treatment. Two deaths and two serious injuries also occurred in Anfu County due to sideline production. Ouyang Haoying, a female member of the Xinyun Agricultural Cooperative in Zhouhu Township of the county, fell to her death while climbing a tree to pick jelly figs. In Dalong Township of Ninggang County and Qiqin Township of Xingan County, two cooperative members had their legs broken by falling trees while chopping wood on the mountain. These bloody facts sound the alarm for leading organs and agricultural cooperatives in various places: it is necessary to strengthen the education of cooperative members on safe production in sideline production.
