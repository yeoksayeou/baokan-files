Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, October 12th. Recently, trucks pulling two trailers have appeared on the Fuzhou-Xiamen highway. This method of further increasing transportation capacity was successfully tested by Zhang Xuan, a driver at the Zhenfeng Maintenance Station near Fuzhou. In late September, he test-drove a six-ton truck pulling two three-ton trailers, departing from Zhenfeng and safely arriving in Hanjiang. The average speed was 22 kilometers per hour. Along the way, during uphill climbs, downhill descents, and turns, the wheel position was the same as a truck pulling one trailer, and the fuel, tire, and parts consumption were also normal. A working group dispatched by the Fujian Provincial Transportation Bureau has specifically summarized this advanced experience and is preparing to promote it on highways throughout the province.

Prior to this, the method of trucks pulling one trailer had already been widely promoted on various highway lines in Fujian. From January to September this year, the amount of goods transported due to trucks pulling one trailer was equivalent to the transportation volume of fifty-five three-ton trucks for nearly a year. According to calculations by relevant departments, if two trailers are pulled, an additional amount of goods equivalent to the transportation volume of sixty-two trucks can be transported each year.

### 进一步提高运输能力  福建载重汽车挂两个拖斗

    进一步提高运输能力
    福建载重汽车挂两个拖斗
    新华社福州12日电　在福州到厦门的公路上，最近出现了一些拖着两个拖斗的运货汽车。这个进一步提高运输能力的办法，是福州附近枕峰保养场驾驶员张宣试验成功的。他在9月下旬试用一辆载重六吨的货车拖带两个各载重三吨的拖斗，由枕峰出发，安全到达涵江，平均每小时走二十二公里，沿途上坡下坡转弯的时候，轮位和拖一个拖斗的汽车一样，燃料、轮胎和机件等消耗情况也正常。福建省运输局派出的一个工作组专门总结了这个先进经验，准备在全省公路上推广。
    在此以前，福建各公路线上已经普遍推广了运货汽车后面拖一个拖斗的办法。从今年1月到9月，全省由于货车带一个拖斗而多运的物资，就相当于五十五辆载重三吨的货车近一年的运输量。据有关部门计算：如果拖两个拖斗，每年还可再多运相当于六十二辆货车运输量的物资。
