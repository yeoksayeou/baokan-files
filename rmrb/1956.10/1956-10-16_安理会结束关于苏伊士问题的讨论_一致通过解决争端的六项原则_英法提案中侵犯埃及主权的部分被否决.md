Xinhua News Agency, October 15th dispatch from New York, TASS: The Security Council held an open meeting on the Suez issue on the evening of October 13th. The meeting concluded the debate on the Suez issue. The first part of the new Anglo-French proposal was adopted, and the second part was rejected.

British Foreign Secretary Lloyd spoke first at the meeting, presenting a new draft resolution on behalf of Britain and France. This draft included the six principles for continuing negotiations, agreed upon by the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Egypt in secret talks. However, it also included other proposals that were essentially a rehash of the old Anglo-French proposals, which were in great contradiction with the agreed-upon six principles.

The Anglo-French draft resolution stipulated that the recommendations of the London Conference of a limited group of canal user nations should be approved, even though Egypt had already stated that these recommendations were unacceptable. The draft stipulated that the future canal management system should provide "sufficiently effective guarantees to users, at least to the extent prescribed by the eighteen-nation proposal." The draft resolution also stipulated that before the final agreement on the Suez Canal system was concluded, the Egyptian authorities should cooperate with the so-called "Canal Users' Association," and that the "Association" should collect canal tolls from its member states' ships, while the Egyptian authorities should guarantee the free passage of these ships.

Lloyd said that although Britain and France did not insist on putting their previous proposals to a vote, they did not abandon them. He made it clear that the previous draft (condemning the nationalization of the Suez Canal) still reflected their position.

Lloyd admitted that in the recent exchange of views, Egypt had made concessions to Western countries, such as on the issue of determining tolls. Lloyd also demanded that further negotiations on the Suez issue must be conducted on the basis of the London Conference's recommendations.

French Foreign Minister Pineau said that the three foreign ministers had not reached any agreement on how to implement the six principles that had already been agreed upon. He believed that these principles could be realized by adopting the eighteen-nation proposal. Pineau said that only those guarantees to "users" included in the "eighteen-nation proposal" could satisfy Britain and France.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi said that the agreement on the six principles was, on the whole, acceptable to the Egyptian government. However, Fawzi added that, in his government's opinion, the best guarantee for the free navigation of the Suez Canal was to solemnly guarantee faithful adherence to the principles of the 1888 Convention.

Fawzi said that at a meeting of the three foreign ministers, he had proposed suggestions for resolving existing differences, especially regarding the formulation of tolls and other fees, and the submission of disputes over freedom of navigation to appropriate arbitration bodies. Fawzi reiterated the Egyptian government's willingness to pay compensation to the former shareholders of the Suez Canal Company and agreed to submit the issue to arbitration if an agreement could not be reached.

Fawzi also said that the second part of the Anglo-French draft resolution could not promote a solution to the problem. He said that adopting the second part of the Anglo-French proposal would not only fail to "isolate" the canal from the politics of any country, but would "casually throw the Suez Canal into the political vortex of many countries."

He hoped that the Security Council would not approve the second part of the Anglo-French draft resolution.

Iranian representative Ardalan said that the Security Council should pay attention to the agreement that had been reached, and he urged the council to avoid taking measures that might hinder future negotiations. He proposed several insignificant "improvements" to the second part of the Anglo-French draft resolution.

Next, Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov made a lengthy speech (the speech will be issued separately).

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said in his speech that the first part of the Anglo-French proposal, which contained principles for resolving the Suez issue, was worthy of warm endorsement. However, Dulles's entire speech defended the second part of the proposal and attempted to prove that the proposal contained no provisions that infringed on Egyptian sovereignty. Dulles concluded by saying that he would vote in favor of the Anglo-French proposal.

Yugoslavian State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Popovic said that he agreed with the unanimously agreed-upon principles in the Anglo-French proposal but could not agree with the second part of the proposal. He emphasized that, in order for future negotiations to be successful, an important prerequisite was that the proposal should be acceptable to all members of the Security Council, and the Anglo-French proposal did not meet this requirement.

Popovic put forward his own proposal, which, in addition to the six unanimously agreed-upon principles for resolving the Suez issue, also suggested continuing negotiations and requested the UN Secretary-General to assist in the future stages of negotiations as necessary. The Yugoslavian proposal also called on all parties concerned to "refrain from any measures that might threaten negotiations."

Representatives of Belgium, Australia, and Peru expressed support for the Anglo-French proposal.

Subsequently, Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov spoke again.

Shepilov said that all the speakers here unanimously pointed out that they fully agreed with the first part of the Anglo-French proposal because this part was a rational compromise. This part of the proposal was progress in formulating measures to resolve the Suez issue and was a concentrated expression of the results of negotiations held between Egypt, the United Kingdom, and France with the active participation of UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld.

The second part of the Anglo-French proposal was quite another matter. It was not the result of the negotiations that had already taken place. It was something that had long been rejected by the Egyptian government. Therefore, this part of the proposal was strongly opposed by Egypt, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia.

Shepilov said that the world public had great expectations of the Security Council. We should unanimously pass a resolution that serves as a good basis for future negotiations to increase the hopes of the world public.

Finally, Shepilov supported the Yugoslavian proposal and emphasized that if the members of the Security Council passed this resolution, it would show their unanimous desire to avoid further complicating negotiations and their common determination to faithfully help resolve the Suez issue.

After Shepilov's speech, the President of the Security Council submitted the Anglo-French proposal to a vote. The first part of the proposal, which contained the agreed-upon principles, was unanimously adopted. The vote on the second part of the proposal resulted in nine votes in favor and two votes against (the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia). According to the principle that the permanent members of the Security Council must be unanimous, this part of the proposal was rejected.

The Yugoslavian representative did not insist on submitting his own proposal to a vote, stating that this proposal was almost entirely consistent with the resolution that had already been passed.

At this point, the Security Council's discussion on the Suez issue came to an end.

    安理会结束关于苏伊士问题的讨论
    一致通过解决争端的六项原则
    英法提案中侵犯埃及主权的部分被否决
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社纽约14日讯：安全理事会10月13日晚间举行了关于苏伊士问题的公开会议。会议结束了关于苏伊士问题的辩论。英法两国新提案的第一部分获得通过，第二部分遭到否决。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德首先在会上发言，他代表英法两国提出了一项新的决议草案。这项草案包括有英法和埃及三国外交部长在秘密会谈中，达成协议的继续举行谈判的六项原则，同时，还包括一些其它的主张，这些主张实际上是旧英法提案的翻版，同协议的六项原则是有极大的矛盾的。
    英法决议草案规定，批准有限的运河使用国集团的伦敦会议所提出的建议，虽然埃及已经表示这些建议是不能接受的。草案规定，对于将来的运河管理制度应当向使用国提供“足够有效的保证，其程度不得少于十八国建议规定的保证”。决议草案还规定，在关于苏伊士运河制度的最后协定没有缔结以前，埃及当局应当同所谓“运河使用国协会”合作，而且“协会”要向它的会员国的船只征收运河通行税，而埃及当局要保证这些船只可以自由通行。
    劳埃德说，虽然英国和法国都不坚持把它们以前的提案付表决，但是它们并不放弃它。他明白表示，以前的草案（谴责苏伊士运河国有化）仍然反映它们的立场。
    劳埃德承认，在最近几天交换意见当中，埃及已经向西方国家让了步，例如在确定通行费的问题上。劳埃德又要求关于苏伊士问题的进一步谈判必需在伦敦会议的建议基础上进行。
    法国外交部长比诺说，三国外交部长对于如何实现已经达成协议的六项原则没有取得任何协议。他认为可以通过采用十八国建议的办法来实现这些原则。比诺说，只有包括在“十八国建议”中的对“使用国”的那些保证才能使英国和法国满意。
    埃及外交部长法齐说，关于六项原则已经达成的协议，整个说来是埃及政府可以接受的。但是法齐补充说，根据他的政府的意见，对苏伊士运河自由通航的最好的保证是庄严地保证忠实于1888年公约的原则。
    法齐说，在一次三国外交部长会议上他曾经提出解决现存分歧的建议，尤其是关于制定通行费和其他费用以及在自由通航问题上发生争执时把这种争执提交适当的仲裁机关的问题的建议。法齐重申埃及政府愿意支付对前苏伊士运河公司股东的赔偿费，并且同意在不能获得协议时将这一问题交付仲裁。
    法齐又说，英法决议草案的第二部分不能促进问题的解决。他说，采纳英法建议的第二部分，不但不能使运河和任何国家的政治“隔离”，反而“把苏伊士运河随便地投入许多国家的政治漩涡中去了”。
    他希望安全理事会不赞同英法决议草案的第二部分。
    伊朗代表阿卜杜说，安全理事会应当注意已经达成的协议，他要求理事会避免采取可能妨碍将来的谈判的措施。他对英法决议草案第二部分提出了数处不足道的“改善”。
    接着是苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫作了长篇发言（发言另发）。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在发言中说，英法提案第一部分包含解决苏伊士问题的原则是值得热烈赞同的。但是，杜勒斯的全部发言都是维护这个提案的第二部分，并且企图证实，仿佛这个提案丝毫没有含有任何侵犯埃及主权的规定。杜勒斯最后说，他将投票赞成英法提案。
    南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国外交国务秘书长波波维奇说，他赞同英法提案中大家一致同意的原则，但是不能赞成这个提案的第二部分。他着重指出，为了今后谈判的取得成功，一个重要前提是，提案应当是安理会全体理事国所能接受的，而英法提案不符合这个要求。
    波波维奇提出了自己的提案，这里面除了六项一致同意的解决苏伊士问题的原则外，还建议继续谈判，并且请求联合国秘书长在必要时对今后各阶段的谈判给予协助。南斯拉夫提案也号召各个有关方面“放弃任何可能威胁谈判的措施”。
    比利时、澳大利亚和秘鲁的代表表示支持英法的提案。
    随后，苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫再次发言。
    谢皮洛夫说，这里所有的发言人都一致指出，他们完全赞同英法提案的第一部分，因为这一部分是一种理智的妥协。提案的这一部分在制订解决苏伊士问题的措施上是一个进展，是埃及、联合王国和法国在联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的积极参加下举行的谈判结果的集中表现。
    英法提案的第二部分就完全是另外一回事了。它不是已经进行的谈判的结果。它是早就被埃及政府拒绝了的东西。因此提案的这一部分受到埃及、苏联和南斯拉夫的严重反对。
    谢皮洛夫说，世界公众对安理会抱着很大的期望，我们应当一致通过一项作为今后谈判的良好基础的决议，以增进世界公众的希望。
    最后，谢皮洛夫支持南斯拉夫的提案，并且强调指出，安理会理事国如果通过这项决议，那就表示它们一致愿望避免谈判进一步复杂化，表示它们共同决心忠实地帮助苏伊士问题的解决。
    在谢皮洛夫发言以后，安理会主席把英法提案提交表决。提案中包含已经达成协议的原则的第一部分被一致通过。提案第二部分的表决结果是，赞成的九票，反对的两票（苏联和南斯拉夫）。根据安理会常任理事国必需一致的原则，提案的这一部分被否决。
    南斯拉夫代表没有坚持把自己的提案提交表决，据他指出，这个提案和已经通过的决议几乎完全一致。
    至此，安理会关于苏伊士问题的讨论即告结束。
