    Zhou Shan Fishery Employs New Fishing Boats and Nets
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch The fishing grounds north of the Zhoushan Islands have recently seen two modern hybrid fishing trawlers. They chase after the early winter yellow croaker shoals on the vast ocean at a speed of 9.3 knots per hour.

    This type of hybrid fishing trawler was designed by Chinese shipbuilding experts according to the characteristics of China's fishing grounds. It can perform trawling, purse seining, and hand-operated netting operations independently or in pairs. It can fish in any fishing ground along China's coast throughout the year. The fishing trawler has seven powerful searchlights, making it possible to fish at night as if it were daytime. All operating systems and net-lifting and anchor-lifting equipment on the vessel are automated. The fishing trawler is equipped with modern communication tools and navigation safety equipment, as well as comfortable bedrooms, dining rooms, and sanitary facilities.

    Also, the technical personnel of the Zhoushan Prefectural Aquatic Products Bureau of Zhejiang Province, together with the members of the Mayi Fishery Cooperative of Putuo County, recently designed a new type of fishing net for fixed net operations. The catch volume of this fishing net is nearly double that of the original fishing net, but the proportion of juvenile fish is only one-tenth, a reduction of four-fifths compared to the past. This is of great benefit to the protection of marine fish seedlings. At present, the Aquatic Products Bureau is sending people to test this fishing net in other fixed net operation areas in the Zhoushan Islands, preparing to continue to improve it and then promote it comprehensively.

    Fixed net operation is a fishing method with primitive characteristics. About one-third of the fishermen in the Zhoushan Islands use this method to fish. Fishermen drive piles into the sea near the islands where they live, set up bamboo frames, install fishing nets on the bamboo frames, and use the power of the tides to intercept passing small fish and shrimp. According to a typical investigation, about 60% of the catch from fixed net operations are juvenile fish of economic fish species such as yellow croaker and hairtail. Under normal circumstances, about one-tenth of them can grow into large fish in two or three years.

    舟山渔场采用新式渔船渔网
    新华社讯　这几天，舟山群岛北部的渔场上出现了两条现代化的混合式渔轮。它们以每小时九点三海里的航速，在辽阔的海洋上追逐着早冬的黄花鱼群。
    这种混合式渔轮，是我国造船专家根据我国渔场特点设计的，可以单独或成对地进行拖网、围网和手操网等不同方式的作业；一年四季，在我国沿海任何渔场都能捕鱼。渔轮上有七座光力强大的探照灯，夜里也能和白天一样捕鱼。船上的全部操纵系统和起网、起锚设备都是自动化的。渔轮里装有现代化的通信联络工具和航海安全设备，还有舒适的寝室、餐室和卫生设备等。
    又讯　浙江省舟山专署水产局的技术人员和普陀县蚂蚁渔业社的社员一起研究，在最近设计出一种新式的张网作业用的渔网。这种渔网的捕获量比原来用的渔网增加将近一倍，但是其中幼鱼只有十分之一，比过去减少了六分之五。这对于保护海洋鱼苗大有好处。目前水产局正派人在舟山群岛的其他张网作业区域试验这种渔网，准备继续加以改进，然后全面推广。
    张网作业是一种带有原始性质的捕鱼方法。舟山群岛的渔民中，大约有三分之一用这种方法捕鱼。渔民们在所住岛屿附近的海里打桩，设置竹架，把渔网装在竹架上，利用潮水的力量拦捕过往的小鱼小虾。根据典型调查，张网作业的捕获物中约有60％是黄花鱼和带鱼等经济鱼类的幼鱼。在通常情况下，它们大约有十分之一在两三年以后可以长成大鱼。
