Xinhua News Agency, October 20th, TASS Cairo, October 19th: According to the "People's Daily," the Arab League Council has approved the resolution proposed by the League's Political Committee to fully support Egypt on the issue of the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company. The League Council declared that Arab nations support the steps taken by Egypt to peacefully resolve the Suez issue and ensure Egypt's independence and legitimate rights.

The Arab League Council also called on Arab nations to fully assist Jordan.

Xinhua News Agency, October 20th, Sofia News Agency, Damascus, October 19th: Syrian President Shukri al-Quwatli, in answering questions from a Sofia News Agency reporter, said that the meeting of the leaders of Syria, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia in Riyadh in late September demonstrated that the unity among Arab nations is solid. The support these countries have shown for Egypt's actions concerning the Suez Canal is real. There are no areas of disagreement among them. The imperialists' attempts to create conspiracies have failed. All of this has been welcomed by the people of Arab nations, who place great hope in this meeting, hoping that Arabs can unite and understand each other.

Speaking about the prospects for the development of political and economic cooperation among Arab nations, he said that, in the political sphere, there are plans to consolidate and strengthen the Arab League Charter, making it more solid and effective. In the economic sphere, the Arab League stipulates the implementation of a unified Arab economic policy. We hope that this plan can be realized. This will benefit Arab nations.

The Syrian President said that the fairest way to resolve the Suez Canal issue is to: recognize the principle of nationalization; recognize Egypt's sovereignty over the canal; and conduct unconditional, direct negotiations with Egypt's leaders in order to reach an agreement on revenue and compensation to shareholders.

Quwatli pointed out that the main reasons for the failure of the two London conferences discussing the Suez Canal issue were that Egypt, a major country enjoying sovereignty over the canal, did not attend the meetings, and that the meetings were conducted under the auspices and pressure of Britain and France.

The reporter asked about the possible consequences of the Suez Canal crisis for Egypt and the entire Arab world on the one hand, and for the three Western countries – Britain, France, and the United States – on the other. Quwatli said, "I want the Security Council and the United Nations to answer this question, because these two bodies are responsible for realizing rights and maintaining world security and peace."

The Syrian President said, in talking about the relationship between Bulgaria and Syria, that the relationship between the two countries is developing greatly, and bilateral trade is constantly expanding, which is in the interests of both countries.

    阿拉伯联盟理事会
    宣布支持埃及和号召援助约旦
    叙利亚总统强调阿拉伯国家团结牢固
    新华社20日讯　塔斯社开罗19日讯：据“人民报”报道，阿拉伯联盟理事会同意联盟的政治委员会提出的关于在苏伊士运河公司国有化问题上完全支持埃及的决议。联盟理事会宣布：阿拉伯国家支持埃及为了和平解决苏伊士问题，保证埃及独立和合法权利所采取的步骤。
    阿拉伯联盟理事会也号召阿拉伯国家全力援助约旦。
    新华社20日讯　据保加利亚通讯社大马士革19日消息：叙利亚总统库阿特利在回答保加利亚通讯社记者的问题的时候说，叙利亚、埃及和沙特阿拉伯三国领导人9月下旬在利雅得举行的会谈表明，阿拉伯国家之间的团结是巩固的。这些国家对埃及有关苏伊士运河的行动所作的支持是现实的。它们之间没有分歧的地方。帝国主义者制造阴谋的企图失败了。这一切都得到各阿拉伯国家人民的欢迎，他们对这次会谈寄予很大希望，希望阿拉伯人能团结和互相谅解。
    谈到阿拉伯国家之间的政治和经济合作的发展前途时，他说，在政治方面，计划巩固和加强阿拉伯联盟公约，使这个公约更为牢固和有效。在经济方面，阿拉伯联盟规定实行统一的阿拉伯经济政策。我们希望这个计划能够实现。这将会有益于阿拉伯国家。
    叙利亚总统说，最公平地解决苏伊士运河问题的办法是：承认国有化的原则；承认埃及对运河的主权；同埃及的领导人进行不附带有条件的、直接的谈判，以便就收入和给股东的赔偿费的问题达成协议。
    库阿特利指出，讨论苏伊士运河问题的两次伦敦会议失败的主要原因，是享有运河主权的埃及这样一个主要国家没有出席会议和会议是在英国和法国主持和压力之下进行的。
    记者问到苏伊士运河危机对埃及和整个阿拉伯世界这一方面以及对三个西方国家——英国、法国和美国另一方面可能造成的后果。库阿特利说，我要让安全理事会和联合国来答复这个问题，因为这两个机构是对实现权利和维护世界安全与和平负责的。
    叙利亚总统在谈到保加利亚和叙利亚两国之间的关系时说，这两国的关系正在大大发展，双方贸易在不断扩大，这是符合两国的利益的。
