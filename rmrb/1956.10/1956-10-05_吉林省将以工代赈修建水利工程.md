Xinhua News Agency, Changchun: The Jilin Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau recently decided to build sixty-four relatively large-scale water conservancy projects. These projects will adopt the method of using labor as relief to mobilize people in disaster areas to work on the projects.

After studying the specific circumstances of the floods suffered by Jilin Province this year, the Jilin Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau put forward a plan for the construction of water conservancy projects. The main projects are: to raise the dikes of the Second Songhua River, which experiences dike breaches almost every year, by about one meter, to ensure that even if the Fengman Hydropower Station upstream releases water at a rate of 5,500 cubic meters per second and there is a once-in-a-century heavy rain downstream at the same time, there will be no dike breaches. In low-lying areas (Lishu, Huaide, Changling counties, etc.) where waterlogging is severe every year, five large drainage ditches and reservoirs will be built. In addition, large-scale dike restoration and breach closures will be carried out at places where dike breaches have occurred on the main streams of the Songhua River and major rivers such as the Yinma River and the Xinkai River. The total earthwork for these projects is approximately 12.6 million cubic meters. After the completion of the projects, they will be able to protect about 350,000 hectares of fertile farmland in the Songliao Plain, preventing them from being flooded even in the event of a major flood like the one in 1956.

In terms of mobilizing laborers, the Jilin Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau also clearly instructed all localities to give priority and favorable treatment to severely affected townships and cooperatives, and to solve the production and livelihood difficulties of the people in disaster areas through the method of using labor as relief. It is calculated that the funds used for these sixty-four projects can buy 160 million catties of sorghum, which can feed 320,000 disaster victims for a year.

    吉林省将以工代赈修建水利工程
    新华社长春电　吉林省水利局最近决定修建六十四项较大型的水利工程。这些工程将采取以工代赈的办法，动员灾区人民施工。
    吉林省水利局对今年吉林省遭受水灾的具体情况加以研究后，提出了修建水利工程的计划。主要的工程是：年年发生漫堤决口的第二松花江，堤防加高一公尺左右，以保证上游丰满水电站在放流到五千五百秒公方时，下游同时发生百年一遇的大雨，也不致发生漫堤决口现象。在每年内涝较严重的低洼地区（梨树、怀德、长岭等县），修五条大型排水沟和储水池等工程。另外，在松花江干流和饮马河、新开河等主要河流曾经发生漫堤决口处，要大规模复堤堵口。这些工程总的土方约为一千二百六十万立方公尺。工程完成后，将可保护松辽平原三十五万公顷左右肥沃的农田，遇到像1956年那样的大水不致被淹没。
    在动员民工方面，吉林省水利局也明确指示各地给重灾乡、社以优先、优厚的待遇，通过以工代赈的办法来解决灾区人民生产、生活上的困难。据计算，这六十四项工程所用的资金，能买高粱一亿六千万斤，可供三十二万灾民吃一年。
