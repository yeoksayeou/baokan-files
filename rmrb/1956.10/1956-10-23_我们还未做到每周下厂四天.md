    We Haven't Yet Achieved Four Days a Week in Factories
      The People's Daily editorial on September 23rd, "Start with Studying Typical Examples," stated: "The director of this bureau (referring to our bureau) personally took the lead in learning from the experience of the裕华Yuhua Textile Factory's leadership in delving into production realities, spending four days a week in the factory to solve various problems..." This passage is not entirely consistent with the actual situation. On many occasions, the bureau's leadership has managed to visit factories four times a week, for approximately half a day each time. However, we have not yet achieved the general practice of spending four full days a week in factories. We hereby clarify this.

### 我们还未做到每周下厂四天

    我们还未做到每周下厂四天
      9月23日人民日报社论“从研究典型做起”中说：“这个局（指我局）的局长亲自带头学习裕华纱厂领导人员深入生产实际的经验，每星期有四天下厂解决各种问题……。”这一段话同实际情况有出入。有许多时候，局的负责人做到了每周下厂四次，每次约半天。但是还未能做到在一般情况下每周有四个整天下厂，特此说明。
