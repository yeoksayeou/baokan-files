Xinhua News Agency report: The Lhasa power plant, built with the help of the State Council, has begun to transmit electricity ahead of schedule.

    The streetlights in Lhasa's most bustling Barkhor Street shone brightly at dusk, eliciting cheers from the children. Electricity was simultaneously supplied to the offices of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Potala Palace, Norbulingka, and many government offices and homes of Tibetan officials. People celebrated National Day night under the bright electric lights.

    The newly built Lhasa power plant has a power generation capacity more than ten times greater than the original power plant. Only one generator is currently transmitting electricity. Soon, two more machines will be able to generate electricity, at which point it will be able to supply electricity for lighting, communications, and several factories in the Lhasa urban area.

    拉萨新电厂提前发电
    据新华社讯　国务院帮助修建的拉萨电厂开始提前送电。
    拉萨市最繁华的八角街的路灯在黄昏中放出光明，引起孩子们的欢呼。电流同时送到西藏自治区筹备委员会的办公厅、布达拉宫、罗布林卡以及许多机关和藏族官员家中。人们在雪亮的电灯光下，欢度国庆节的夜晚。
    新建的拉萨电厂比原电厂发电量大十多倍，现在送电的只一台发电机。不久另两台机器就可发电，那时可以供应拉萨市区的照明、通讯和几个工厂的用电。
