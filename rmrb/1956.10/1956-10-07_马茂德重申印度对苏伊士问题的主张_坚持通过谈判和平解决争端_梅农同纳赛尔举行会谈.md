Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 6th - Indian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Syed Mahmud, said at a gathering in Patna on October 4th that Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal "was merely exercising its sovereignty." He said that if President Nasser had not calmly handled the Suez issue in the face of constant provocations, a third world war might have already occurred.

Mahmud said that India has been explaining to Britain and other Western countries that imposing economic sanctions on Egypt would directly harm their own interests. India insists that the Suez issue can only be resolved through negotiations among the disputing parties. He said, "Some Western countries have described this as India's action to protect Egypt. Nothing could be more absurd than this statement."

Mahmud said that India strongly opposes the use of economic sanctions against Egypt, and from the beginning, it has been working for a peaceful resolution of the Suez issue. He said that President Nasser's lack of agitation in the face of provocations from Western countries is to Nasser's credit. One of the Western countries' attempts at provocation was the sudden withdrawal of European pilots working in the Suez Canal.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th - Cairo dispatch: Indian Minister Without Portfolio, Krishna Menon, arrived in Cairo on October 5th. On the same day, he held lengthy talks with Egyptian President Nasser.

According to an Indian spokesman, Menon is continuing to seek a basis for a negotiated settlement of the Suez Canal issue that can be accepted by all disputing parties.

The spokesman said that Menon did not offer any specific or clear proposals but would conduct a thorough study of Egypt's attitude before going to London and New York to meet with Western leaders.

    马茂德重申印度对苏伊士问题的主张
    坚持通过谈判和平解决争端
    梅农同纳赛尔举行会谈
    新华社新德里6日电　印度外交部副部长赛义德·马茂德10月4日在巴特那的一次集会上说，埃及把苏伊士运河收归国有“只是行使它的主权”。他说，如果不是纳赛尔总统在不断的挑衅面前冷静地处理苏伊士问题，这时可能已经发生第三次世界大战了。
    马茂德说，印度一直在向英国和其他西方国家解说，对埃及实行经济制裁将直接不利于它们自己的利益。印度坚持说，只有争执各方通过谈判取得解决才能解决苏伊士问题。他说，“有些西方国家把这说成是印度袒护埃及的行动。再没有比这种说法更荒谬的了。”
    马茂德说，印度强烈地反对对埃及使用经济制裁，而且从一开始起它就是为和平解决苏伊士问题而努力的。他说，纳赛尔总统没有因为西方国家的挑衅而激动，这是纳赛尔的光荣。西方国家的这种挑衅企图之一是突然撤走在苏伊士运河工作的欧洲籍引水员。
    新华社6日讯　开罗消息：印度不管部长克里希纳·梅农10月5日到达了开罗。当天，他同埃及总统纳赛尔举行了长时间的会谈。
    据一位印度发言人说，梅农正在继续设法寻求一个可以被争执各方所接受的谈判解决苏伊士运河问题的基础。
    发言人说，梅农没有提出具体的明确的建议，但在去伦敦和纽约同西方领袖会谈之前要对埃及的态度进行周密的研究。
