Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 14th: Hong Kong reports: Hong Kong's "Wen Wei Po" and "Hong Kong Commercial Daily" today published commentaries, hoping that the Hong Kong British authorities will swiftly take practical and effective measures to quell the riots and punish the culprits who created the riots.

The "Wen Wei Po," in its editorial titled "Severely Punish the Masterminds and Eradicate the Source of Trouble," said: For the sake of the vast number of residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon, we believe that the Hong Kong authorities should swiftly take necessary measures to eliminate the Kuomintang secret agents, severely punish the real masterminds, and eradicate the source of trouble.

The editorial refuted the claim that the nature of this riot has become a party struggle or that the incident was instigated by the underworld. The editorial said that this is not only inconsistent with the facts, but also an attempt to shirk responsibility. It is a clear and undeniable fact that Kuomintang secret agents instigated the riots.

Today’s commentary in the "Hong Kong Commercial Daily" said that the Kowloon riots have not completely ended. Hong Kong residents are now paying attention to two issues: how the Hong Kong British authorities will punish the instigators and perpetrators of this riot, and how the Hong Kong authorities will prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future. The commentary said: The Hong Kong British authorities have arrested more than 3,000 people, which is certainly necessary, but people are still concerned about one question: Have the real instigators and perpetrators of this riot been brought to justice? How will the Hong Kong British authorities deal with these people?

Hong Kong's "Tonight Post" published a commentary tonight, demanding that the Hong Kong British authorities arrest the masterminds behind the Kowloon riots.

The commentary said: The disaster caused by this riot was so severe, the situation so tragic, and the damage suffered by all parties so great that it was unprecedented. After the pain subsides, and mindful of the lessons learned from this, the Hong Kong government should be responsible for preventing similar incidents in the future and protecting Hong Kong residents.

    “文汇报”、“香港商报”评论要求：
    平息骚乱严惩凶手
    据新华社广州14日电　香港消息：香港“文汇报”和“香港商报”今天发表评论，希望香港英国当局迅速采取切实有效措施，平息骚乱，惩办制造骚乱的凶手。
    “文汇报”在“严惩主凶、根绝祸源”为题发表的社论中说：为了港九广大居民着想，我们认为香港当局应该迅速采取必要措施，肃清国民党特务，严惩真正主凶，根绝祸源。
    社论驳斥了所谓这次暴乱的性质已变成党派斗争，或者说事件是黑社会策动的说法。社论说，这不仅不符合事实，而且是企图推卸责任。国民党特务策动骚乱，是事实俱在，有目共睹的。
    “香港商报”今天的评论说，九龙的暴乱还没有完全了结。香港的居民现在都注意着两个问题，就是香港英国当局如何惩处这次骚乱事件的煽动者和肇事者，以及香港当局如何防止今后类似事件的再度发生。评论说：香港英国当局已逮捕了三千多人，这种措施当然是必要的，但是人们仍然关心一个问题：是不是这次暴乱事件的真正煽动者和肇事者都已落网？香港英国当局将如何发落这些人。
    香港“今晚报”今晚发表评论，要求香港英国当局缉拿策动九龙骚乱的祸首。
    评论说：这次骚乱为祸之烈，情况之惨，各方所受损害之重，都是空前的。痛定思痛，凛于这次的教训，今后如何防患于未然，保障香港居民，是港府应该负起的责任了。
