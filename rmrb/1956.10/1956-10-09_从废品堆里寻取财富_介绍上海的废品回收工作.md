　　Extracting Wealth from Scrap Piles
    ——Introducing Shanghai's Waste Recycling Work
　　By our staff reporter Xi Ping
    In the "Waste Recycling Station"
  　When you buy a shiny stainless steel watchband from a department store, you can hardly believe that it is made of waste steel sheets. When you see a brand-new sewing machine, you would never imagine that the shiny black table board on the machine is made from scrap wood. In daily life, people consume many things every day, but they don't know that many damaged and old materials often return to our lives through the hands of hardworking people.
    Not long ago, I visited the waste recycling station under the Shanghai Handicraft Industry Bureau. In a warehouse covering an area of more than 40 mu, there were piles of broken and discarded things everywhere. Many workers were carefully sorting them according to their types and degree of damage.
    "Don't look down on these broken and tattered things, they are very useful," the staff of the recycling station said to me with a confident tone. Although it is called a waste recycling station, there is actually no real waste here; everything piled here, even a pinch of sawdust, a piece of rag, or a broken iron nail, has its different uses.
    A piece of old iron sheet is not wasted here at all. The large ones are made into stoves, dustpans, kettles, and saw blades. The remaining small iron sheets can also be used to make garter buckles, shoe eye buckles, and drawing pins. A pile of old cotton, the newer ones can be fluffed into new batting, the older ones can be spun into yarn, woven into canvas, coarse cloth, work gloves, travel net bags, and spun into thread for making soles. Everyone knows that rags can be used to make paper and shoe linings, but in Shanghai, new uses have been found for rags, which is to manufacture cloth grinding wheels. The method is to paste the rags into cloth pieces with a diameter of ten to twelve inches and a thickness of one to three inches, cover them with pigskin, and string them together with hemp rope. This is an indispensable tool for polishing in the shipbuilding electroplating industry. At present, this product is far from meeting the needs of production.
    Together with the staff of the recycling station, I also visited a smelting cooperative affiliated to the waste recycling station. The recycling station has a total of three smelting cooperatives, and this is one of them. In the cooperative's workshop stood a blast furnace for smelting metal. This is a special smelting furnace. The raw materials that workers throw into the blast furnace are not ore, but metal scraps collected from many machine factories in Shanghai and rotten iron sheets recycled from the alleyways. Another cupola furnace smelts garbage containing metal swept from smelting plants. People smelt several thousand tons of metal from this garbage every year. Not long ago, a joint state-private wire factory in Shanghai moved its factory site. There was a large pool at the old factory site. The staff of the recycling station was as happy as if they had discovered a treasure after finding this pool. They determined that a large amount of metal scraps must have been deposited in the mud of this pool, so they dug out the mud and sand at the bottom of the pool and the sludge in the sewers and sent it for smelting. Sure enough, more than 700 jin of electrolytic copper was extracted.
    Waste Acquisition Network Distributed Throughout the City
    The waste recycling work in Shanghai has long been an important part of Shanghai's economic organization, with tens of thousands of people engaged in this meaningful social labor every day. After liberation, this work was further expanded under the leadership of the state. In 1952, the Shanghai Handicraft Industry Cooperative Union established a city-wide waste recycling station. In the past few years, thirty-one branches have been established in various districts of the city. These acquisition units set up in various districts have regular contacts with factories, enterprises, institutions, and organizations. These units also send staff to the neighborhoods to carry out publicity work and acquire waste materials.
    Another important force in Shanghai's waste acquisition network is the waste industry distributed throughout the city. There are more than 20 kinds of industries engaged in waste management in Shanghai. The practitioners in these industries have become experts in utilizing waste materials. In the course of many years of operation, they are familiar with the performance and uses of various waste materials; they can distinguish what is steel and what is wrought iron from a pile of waste materials. They sort out all kinds of materials clearly and then send them to handicrafts producers or waste recycling stations by category, so that everything can be used to its fullest. In the socialist transformation in Shanghai, attention was paid to maintaining the business characteristics of this industry, and their experience in this regard was valued.
    I once visited some practitioners in this industry. When they talked to me about their work, they said: In the eyes of others, our industry is very simple, we collect and sell. In fact, this work is not as simple as imagined, it requires a wealth of production knowledge. For example, for a batch of broken rubber inner tubes, people who are not familiar with this business will send them to the factory to be re-melted and made into reclaimed rubber regardless of whether they are good or bad, but those who understand the business will first use them to make raincoats, elastic bands, slingshots for children, and rubber bands, and finally consider re-melting them. We always try to ensure that every piece of scrap copper and iron in our hands is used most rationally.
    Infinite Potential
    Waste recycling has become an important source of raw materials for industrial production in Shanghai. Many small factories and workshops in Shanghai that produce daily necessities rely on waste materials for production, so the product cost is low and the selling price is cheap. There is an industry in Shanghai that manufactures shoe eye buckles, with a total of more than 40 factories and workshops, producing more than 70 million shoe eye buckles every month. If new materials are used for production, the raw materials need to be imported from abroad, which requires about 240,000 US dollars in foreign exchange every year. Now the raw materials used by these factories are all waste iron sheets from enamel factories, and its cost is only one-third of that of new materials. The Xingguang White Iron Production Cooperative in Shanghai, which specializes in manufacturing daily necessities such as briquette stoves, used to have difficulty in selling its products due to high costs, and its business was very difficult. Later, the waste recycling station supplied it with waste materials for production, reducing costs by 17%, and the enterprise was consolidated and developed. In the case of tight supply of raw materials this year, waste recycling has also provided useful raw materials to some large factories. The recycling of metal waste in Shanghai has been included in the national material distribution plan, and it is planned to be uniformly distributed to factories by the Materials Supply Bureau. Since 1952, the Shanghai Handicraft Industry Bureau Waste Recycling Station has recycled more than 11,000 tons of mixed copper, more than 50,000 tons of waste steel, more than 2,000 tons of lead and tin, and more than 300 tons of nickel coins. These waste materials recycled from the people have been put back into production, creating huge wealth for the country.
    The potential of waste recycling is endless. Although Shanghai has done a relatively good job in this regard, it has not yet unearthed all the wealth that can be utilized. At present, many acquisition units feel that the source of goods is not strong, mainly because the acquisition work is not deep enough, and the publicity work for the masses is very weak. Many residents still do not understand the uses of various waste products, and are not accustomed to collecting waste products and handing them over to the waste recycling station. In December last year, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League mobilized students from more than 1,700 primary and secondary schools in Shanghai to collect waste copper and iron for the waste recycling station. In December alone, 300,000 jin of waste products were collected. The acquisition station also conducted two experimental acquisition activities in a lane on Renxing Street in Yangpu District, Shanghai. In just two times, this lane of nearly 100 households recovered a total of 5,000 jin of various waste products. The staff of the waste recycling station said that there are many things that can be used around people. Even a piece of waste paper or a piece of rag is useful wealth. We should develop a habit of saving in daily life and send all usable waste items to the waste recycling station so that it can serve our better life again.

　　从废品堆里寻取财富
    ——介绍上海的废品回收工作
　　本报记者　习平
    在“废品回收站”里
  　当你从百货公司买回一只闪光的不锈钢表带的时候，你很难相信它是用废旧钢皮做成的。当你看到一台崭新的缝纫机的时候，怎样也想不到机器上那块漆得乌亮的台板，是利用零碎木料制作的。人们在日常生活里，每天都在损耗掉许多东西，却不知道许多被损坏了的废旧料，常常通过勤劳者的手，重新回到我们的生活中来。
    不久前，我参观了上海手工业管理局所属的废品回收站。在一个占地面积四十多亩的仓库里，到处堆积着被人们丢弃了的破烂东西。许多工人都在按照它们的类别和损坏程度，细心地加以整理。
    “不要看不起这些破破烂烂的东西，它们的用处可大哩。”回收站的工作人员以一种自信的口吻对我说。虽然叫做废品回收站，实际上这里并没有真正的废品；所有堆在这里的东西，哪怕是一撮木屑，一片破布，一枚断铁钉，都有它不同的用处。
    一块旧铁皮在这里一点也浪费不了，大的做成火炉，簸箕，水壶，锯条，剩下的小铁皮还可以做袜带扣，鞋眼扣和图画钉。一堆旧的棉花，较新的可以弹松成新的絮棉，旧的纺线，织成帆布，土布，劳动手套，旅行网袋，纺成纳鞋底的线。大家都知道破布可以造纸，可以糊鞋衬，但在上海，又给破布找到了新的用途，就是制造布制沙轮。做法是把破布贴成十寸到十二寸直径、厚一寸到三寸不等的布块，用猪革做封面，用麻绳串扎起来就成了。这是造船电镀工业抛光用的不可缺少的工具，目前这种产品远远不能满足生产上的需要。
    我和回收站的工作人员一起又参观了废品回收站所属的一个冶炼合作社。回收站共有三个冶炼合作社，这就是其中之一。合作社工场里矗立着冶炼金属的高炉，这是一座特殊的冶炼炉，工人们投进高炉里去的原料，不是矿石，而是从上海许多机器工厂里搜集来的金属屑和从里弄回收来的烂铁皮。另一座墩炉里冶炼的是从冶炼厂里打扫来的含有金属的垃圾，人们从这种垃圾里每年要冶炼出好几千吨金属来。不久前，上海一家公私合营电线厂迁移厂址，在旧厂址里有一个大的水池。回收站工作人员发现这个水池后，高兴得像发现了宝藏似的，他们断定这个水池的烂泥里一定沉淀着大量金属屑，就将池底的泥沙和阴沟里的污泥挖了出来，送去冶炼，果然提炼出了电解铜七百多斤。
    废品收购网分布全市
    上海市的废品回收工作，很久以前就已经成为上海经济组织中的一个重要部分，每天有数万人从事着这项有意义的社会劳动。解放以后，这项工作在国家领导下更加扩大了，1952年，上海市手工业合作社联合社成立了全市性的废品回收站。几年来，在全市各区成立了三十一个分支机构，这些分设在各区的收购单位，和工厂、企业、机关、团体都有着经常的联系。这些单位还派遣工作人员深入里弄，向居民进行宣传工作，收购废旧物资。
    上海废品收购网的另一支重要力量，是分布在全市的废品行业。上海经营废品的共有二十多种行业。这些行业的从业人员已经成了利用废旧料的专家，他们在多年的经营过程中，谙熟了各种废旧材料的性能和用途；他们能从一堆废料中，辨别出什么是钢材，什么是熟铁。他们把各种材料整理得一清二楚，然后分门别类地送给手工业生产者或废品回收站，使得物尽其用。上海在社会主义改造中，注意保持了这个行业的经营特点，并且重视了他们在这方面的经验。
    我曾经访问了这个行业里的一些从业人员。他们在向我谈到他们的工作情况时说：别人看来，我们这个行业是再简单不过的，收进来，买出去。其实这项工作并不是想像的那样简单，它需要有丰富的生产知识。例如，一批破的橡胶内胎，不熟悉这项业务的人会不管好坏都送到厂里重新回炉制作再生胶，但是懂得业务的人就先把它利用来做雨衣、松紧带、儿童玩的弹弓和橡皮圈，最后才考虑回炉。我们总是设法让经过我们手里的每一块破铜烂铁，都得到最合理的利用。
    潜力无穷
    废品回收已经成为上海工业生产原料的一个重要来源。上海许多生产日用小商品的小型工场、作坊，都是依靠废旧料来进行生产的，因此产品成本低，售价便宜。上海有一个制作鞋眼扣的行业，共有四十多家厂坊，每月生产鞋眼扣七千多万只，如果使用新料生产，原料需要从国外进口，每年约需外汇达二十四万美元，现在这些厂坊使用的原料全部是搪瓷厂的下脚铁皮，它的成本只及新料的三分之一。上海有一家专门制造煤球炉等日用品的星光白铁生产合作社，过去因成本太高，货销不出去，营业很困难，后来废品回收站供给它废旧原料来进行生产，降低成本17％，企业得到了巩固和发展。在今年原材料供应紧张的情况下，废品回收也给一些大型工厂输送了有用的原料。上海金属废料的回收已经列入国家物资分配计划，有计划地由物资供应局统一分配给工厂。从1952年以来，上海手工业管理局废品回收站回收了杂铜一万一千多吨，废钢铁五万多吨，铅、锡二千多吨，镍币三百多吨。这些从民间回收的废旧料都重新投入了生产，为国家创造了巨额财富。
    废品回收的潜力是无穷无尽的。上海在这方面的工作虽然做得比较好，但是还远远没有把可以利用的财富都发掘出来。目前，许多收购单位感到货源不旺盛，这主要是因为收购工作还不够深入，对群众的宣传工作很薄弱，许多居民还不懂得各种废旧品的用处，不习惯将废旧品收集起来交给废品回收站。去年12月，青年团上海市委会曾经发动上海市一千七百多个中小学校的学生，给废品回收站搜集废旧铜铁，仅仅在12月份一个月，就搜集废品三十万斤。收购站还在上海杨浦区仁兴街一条里弄里作了两次试验性收购活动，仅仅两次，这个近百户的里弄里共收回各种废品达五千斤。废品回收站的工作人员说，在人们的周围，有许多可以利用的东西，哪怕是一张破纸，一片破布，都是有用的财富，我们应当在日常生活中养成节约的习惯，把一切能利用的废旧物品都送到废品回收站去，让它重新为我们的美好生活服务。
