President Sukarno's Speech at Beijing Airport

    Your Excellencies, brothers and sisters:

    After staying in Beijing for six days, I am leaving Beijing today. Actually, I have been on the road for more than forty days. In constant travel, I have become a symbol – a symbol of our country, a symbol of our nation. I always call my nation a fighting nation; and for a fighting nation, the journey has no end.

    You, my brothers and sisters, have received me very kindly, with a friendly heart, with true brotherly affection. I am very grateful for this.

    Indonesia is moving forward, and People's China is also moving forward. We move forward together, as friends, as comrades, as comrades-in-arms.

    There is an old saying in Indonesia, which means: "The eyes see far, but the heart is very close."

    You, the people of Beijing, I will see far with my eyes, but you will always be close to my heart.

    I have invited my dear friend and brother, Chairman Mao Zedong, to visit Indonesia, and I am happy to announce that Chairman Mao Zedong has accepted my invitation. I am grateful for this.

    My brother Mao Zedong, I hope to see you soon in Indonesia. The people of Indonesia are waiting for you.

    Friends, brothers, sisters:

    Goodbye! Thank you!

### 苏加诺总统在北京机场的讲话

    苏加诺总统在北京机场的讲话诸位阁下：兄弟姊妹们：
    在北京逗留了六天以后，今天我就要离开北京了。实际上我在路上已经不止四十天了。在经常不断的旅行中，我成了一个象征——我们国家的象征，我们民族的象征。我总是把我的民族称为战斗的民族；而对战斗的民族说来，旅程是没有止境的。
    你们，我的兄弟姊妹们，你们非常亲切地，怀着朋友的心情，怀着真正的兄弟之情接待了我。我对此十分感激。
    印度尼西亚在不断前进，人民中国也在不断前进。我们共同前进，作为朋友共同前进，作为同志共同前进，作为战友共同前进。
    印度尼西亚有一句老话，意思就是：“眼睛看来很远，但是心靠得很近。”
    你们北京人民我用眼睛来看将是很远的，但是你们将永远靠近我的心。
    我已经邀请我亲爱的朋友和兄弟毛泽东主席去访问印度尼西亚，我很高兴地宣布：毛泽东主席已经接受我的邀请。我对此表示感激。
    我的兄弟毛泽东，我希望不久就能在印度尼西亚见到你。印度尼西亚人民在等待着你。
    朋友们，兄弟们，姊妹们：
    再见！谢谢！
