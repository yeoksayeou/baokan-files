Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 10th. President Sukarno said at a banquet held tonight by Mayor Chen Yi to welcome him that the imperialists predicted that the Republic of Indonesia could not exist for ten days, but it has existed for a full eleven years and will live forever.

President Sukarno said that since arriving in China, he has received the warmest and most sincere welcome from the Chinese people. Today, upon arriving in Shanghai, he received the warmest and most solemn welcome from the people of Shanghai. This welcome is not for President Sukarno personally, nor for Sukarno, but a welcome showing sympathy for the Indonesian people's struggle against colonialism and imperialism.

President Sukarno said that, as far as he knows, some people abroad say that the Chinese people's welcome to him is not spontaneous but is organized and directed by the Chinese government. This is the biggest and worst lie that violates the facts. He said that in China, he saw tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of people cheering and laughing. This warm welcome from the Chinese people is by no means fabricated but comes from the heart and is sincere.

President Sukarno said that when he returns to Indonesia, if someone asks him what he discovered in China, he will answer that what he discovered was the Chinese people, a people full of sympathy for the Indonesian people, a people who support Indonesia's "independence forever once it is achieved," and that 600 million Chinese people are united and incredibly strong.

President Sukarno then said that the Indonesian nation is very fortunate to have the Chinese people, such a strong people with the same determination, as friends. Such a nation will not perish but will exist forever.

Finally, President Sukarno raised his glass to toast the consolidated friendship between China and Indonesia and the health of Chairman Mao Zedong.

At the beginning of the banquet, Mayor Chen Yi delivered a speech, extending a warm welcome to President Sukarno and all distinguished guests from Indonesia.

Chen Yi said that this city you have come to is a city that has been reborn after breaking free from the shackles of colonialism. The colonialists once predicted that we would not be able to live in this city for three months, but we have lived here for seven years, and we will live here forever. The colonialists once predicted that we would not be able to manage this big city without relying on them; however, now even the predictors themselves have to admit that our level of city management exceeds theirs. Chen Yi said that the people who can create all miracles, having gotten rid of the shackles of the colonialists, have lost only poverty, hunger, and backwardness, and have gained prosperity, happiness, and strength.

Chen Yi also said that China and Indonesia's shared experiences, shared suffering, and shared ideals have brought us closer and closer together. In the future, we will cooperate more closely, support and help each other. The people of Shanghai, like the people of the whole country, will always firmly remember what Chairman Mao Zedong taught us: The Chinese people will always be loyal friends of the Indonesian people.

Chen Yi finally raised his glass to the eternal friendship between the people of China and Indonesia, to the increasingly great influence of the Bandung spirit in international affairs, to the health of the great leader of Indonesian independence and freedom, the respected President Sukarno, and to the health of the distinguished Indonesian guests.

Also invited to attend tonight's banquet were senior officials accompanying President Sukarno and Indonesian Ambassador to China, Wiyopoenoto. Diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in Shanghai also attended the banquet.

Attending the banquet as hosts were more than 400 people, including leaders from the Shanghai Municipal Party and government, the military, and people from all walks of life.

After the banquet, President Sukarno and his accompanying senior officials, accompanied by Mayor Chen Yi and others, attended the evening performance and watched the Peking Opera "The Goddess of Luo River" performed by the famous Chinese performing artist Mei Lanfang and enjoyed the performance of the Shanghai Philharmonic Orchestra.

    陈毅市长设宴欢迎苏加诺总统
    苏加诺总统在宴会上说，他受到中国人民最热烈最忠诚的欢迎
    新华社上海10日电　苏加诺总统今晚在陈毅市长为欢迎他举行的宴会上说，帝国主义预言印度尼西亚共和国不能存在十天，但它已足足存在十一年并将永远生存下去。
    苏加诺总统说，他来到中国以后，受到中国人民最热烈最忠诚的欢迎。今天来到了上海，受到上海人民最热烈最隆重的欢迎。这不是对苏加诺总统个人的欢迎，也不是对朋加诺的欢迎，这种欢迎是同情印度尼西亚人民反对殖民主义和帝国主义的斗争的欢迎。
    苏加诺总统说，据他知道，在外国有人说，中国人民对他的欢迎不是自发的，而是受中国政府组织的、指使的。这是最大的、最坏的违反事实的谎言。他说，在中国他看到几万、几十万甚至百万人的欢呼和欢笑。中国人民这种热烈的欢迎决不是制造的，而是发自内心的、由衷的欢迎。
    苏加诺总统说，他回印度尼西亚去以后，如果有人问起他在中国发现了什么，那末他将回答说，他发现的是中国人民，是对印度尼西亚人民充满同情的人民，是支持印度尼西亚“一经独立、永远独立”的人民，中国六万万人民团结一致，坚强无比。
    苏加诺总统接着说，印度尼西亚民族有中国人民这样强大、具有同一决心的人民作朋友，非常之好。这样的民族不会灭亡，将永远存在。
    最后，苏加诺总统举杯祝中国和印度尼西亚巩固的友谊，祝毛泽东主席的健康。
    在宴会开始的时候，陈毅市长致词向苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚的全体贵宾们表示热烈欢迎。
    陈毅说，你们光临的这个城市，是挣脱殖民主义锁链后获得新生不久的一座城市。殖民主义者曾经预言我们在这个城市里住不了三个月，但是我们住了七年了，我们要永远地住下去。殖民主义者曾经预言不仰仗他们的鼻息，我们管理不了这座大城市；但是，现在连预言者自己也不得不承认我们对城市的管理的水平超过了他们。陈毅说，能够创造一切奇迹的人民，摆脱了殖民主义者的羁绊，失去的只是贫困、饥饿和落后，换来的却是繁荣、幸福和富强。
    陈毅又说，中国和印度尼西亚的共同经历、共同遭受和共同理想，使得我们愈来愈紧密地联结在一起。今后我们将更加紧密地合作，互相支持和帮助。上海人民和全国人民一样，将永远地牢牢地记着毛泽东主席教导我们的话：中国人民将永远是印度尼西亚人民忠实的朋友。
    陈毅最后举杯为中国和印度尼西亚两国人民永恒的友谊、为万隆精神在国际事务中起着日益巨大的影响，为印度尼西亚独立和自由的伟大的领袖、尊敬的苏加诺总统阁下的健康，为印度尼西亚贵宾们的健康干杯。
    应邀出席今晚宴会的，还有苏加诺总统的随行的高级官员和印度尼西亚驻中国大使维约普拉诺托。各国驻上海的外交官员们也出席了宴会。
    出席宴会作陪的，有上海市党和政府、军队的负责人以及社会各界人士四百多人。
    宴会后，苏加诺总统和他的随行的高级官员由陈毅市长等陪同出席了晚会，观看中国著名表演艺术家梅兰芳所演的京剧“洛神”，欣赏了上海乐团交响乐队的演奏。
