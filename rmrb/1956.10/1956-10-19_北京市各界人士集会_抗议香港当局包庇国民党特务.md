Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Personages in charge of democratic parties and people's organizations in Beijing, as well as democratic figures from all walks of life, gathered today to express their extreme anger at the Kowloon riots created by Kuomintang secret agents, and lodged a serious protest against the attitude of the British authorities in Hong Kong in harboring Kuomintang secret agents and deliberately distorting the truth.

    Li Boqiu, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said: Kuomintang secret agents have committed heinous crimes in Kowloon, but the British authorities in Hong Kong are protecting them, which makes us feel extremely resentful. We are here to tell Mr. Grantham, the British Governor of Hong Kong, that all Chinese people are very concerned about the safety of the lives and property of the more than two million Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon. We hope that you will earnestly take responsibility, quickly arrest the murderers, and properly arrange for the affected people.

    Chen Qiyuan, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said: The British Governor of Hong Kong said that our government's protest was "interference in internal affairs," which is a complete distortion and slander. The lives and property of more than two million Chinese people in Hong Kong and Kowloon have been threatened, many people have been killed, and some factories, shops, and schools have been looted and burned. Is it not right and proper for our government to lodge a serious protest with the British authorities in order to protect their lives and property?

    Wang Jiong, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, said: As a Chinese, I am very concerned about the disasters suffered by the people of Kowloon. As a trade union worker, I pay close attention to the atrocities committed by Kuomintang secret agents against the trade unions and the working class in Kowloon. Everyone can see clearly that only with the connivance of the British authorities in Hong Kong could these atrocities continue for several days. The workers of Beijing cannot ignore this incident. We firmly support the protest lodged by our government and support the four demands made by the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions to the British authorities in Hong Kong. We express brotherly sympathy to the people of Kowloon who died in the atrocities of the Kuomintang secret agents.

    Zhang Shou Kang, a member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and a lecturer at Beijing Normal College, said: As an educator, I feel extremely resentful about the crimes of Kuomintang secret agents in undermining education, and I express my deep condolences to the teachers and students of Heung To Middle School. The British authorities in Hong Kong should earnestly and properly handle this incident and ensure that such incidents do not happen again in the future. The attitude expressed by the British Governor of Hong Kong on the 16th was extremely irresponsible.

    Also speaking at today's meeting were religious figures, industrialists and businessmen, women workers, university presidents, and old ivory carving artists.

    Today's meeting was convened by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The chairman of the meeting was Jiang Guangnai, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference.

    北京市各界人士集会
    抗议香港当局包庇国民党特务
    新华社18日讯　北京市各民主党派各人民团体的负责人和各界民主人士，今天集会对国民党特务制造的九龙暴乱事件表示极大的愤怒，对于香港英国当局包庇国民党特务、蓄意颠倒是非的态度提出了严重抗议。
    中国农工民主党北京市委员会主任委员李伯球说：国民党特务在九龙犯下了滔天罪行，但是香港英国当局却在包庇他们，这使我们感到极大愤恨。我们在这里告诉香港英国总督葛量洪先生，我们全中国人民都很关心香港九龙两百多万中国人民生命财产的安全，我们希望你们切实负起责任，迅速缉拿凶手，并且对受害人民要妥善安排。
    北京市归国华侨联谊会主席陈其瑗说：香港英国总督说我国政府的抗议是什么“干涉内政”，这是十足的歪曲污蔑。香港九龙两百多万中国人民受到了生命财产的威胁，许多人被杀害了，有一些工厂、商店、学校被抢劫焚烧了，我国政府为了保障他们生命财产安全，向英国当局提出严重抗议，难道是不应该的吗？是不正当的吗？
    北京市工会联合会主席王烱说：作为一个中国人我十分关心九龙人民受到的灾害。作为工会工作者，我十分注意国民党特务对九龙的工会、工人阶级施行的暴行。大家看得清楚，只有在香港英国当局纵容下，这种暴行才继续了几天。我们北京市工人对于这一事件不能置之不理，我们坚决支持我国政府提出的抗议，支持港九工会联合会向香港英国当局提出的四项要求，对在国民党特务暴行下死难的九龙人民，表示兄弟般的同情。
    中国人民政治协商会议北京市委员会委员、北京师范学院讲师张寿康说：作为一个教育工作者，我对于国民党特务破坏教育事业罪行，感到极大愤恨，对香岛中学师生表示深切的慰问。香港英国当局应当切实妥善处理这次事件，并且要保证今后不再发生此类事件。香港英国总督在16日表示的态度，是极不负责的。
    在今天会议上发言的，还有宗教界人士，工商业家，妇女工作者，大学校长，以及老象牙雕刻艺人等。
    今天会议是中国人民政治协商会议北京市委员会召开的。会议主席是中国国民党革命委员会北京市委员会主任委员、北京市政协副主席蒋光鼐。
