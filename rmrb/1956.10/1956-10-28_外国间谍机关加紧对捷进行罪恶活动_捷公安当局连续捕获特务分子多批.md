Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 27th: Czechoslovak newspapers have recently reported numerous instances of hostile activities conducted by foreign spy agencies and sabotage groups in Czechoslovakia.

In addition to a large number of balloons carrying provocative leaflets from the American "Radio Free Europe" being discovered in Czechoslovak airspace, signs of foreign intelligence agencies intensifying the dispatch of special agents and saboteurs into Czechoslovakia have also become more apparent.

According to newspaper reports, a Czechoslovak citizen named Rudolf Vit recently surrendered himself to the Czechoslovak Public Security authorities. He was recruited by British intelligence agencies to carry out sabotage activities while on a business trip to Hamburg, West Germany. He stated that he did not dare to carry out the sabotage mission, which would have caused casualties, and therefore surrendered.

Czechoslovak State Public Security authorities announced the arrest of spies and saboteurs Mareš and Garuška, who had previously fled to West Germany. After receiving special agent training in West Germany, they were sent to Czechoslovakia, where they were tasked with collecting military intelligence, setting fire to factories and Unified Agricultural Cooperative houses, and creating chaos.

In addition, Czechoslovak State Public Security authorities have also detained several other spies and saboteurs. These individuals will soon be brought to trial.

    外国间谍机关加紧对捷进行罪恶活动
    捷公安当局连续捕获特务分子多批
    新华社布拉格27日电　最近捷克斯洛伐克的报纸报道了外国间谍机关和破坏团体在捷克斯洛伐克进行敌对活动的无数事实。
    除了在捷克斯洛伐克领土上空发现大批带有美国“自由欧洲”电台挑衅性传单的气球外，外国情报机关加紧向捷派遣特务和破坏分子的迹象也更加明显了。
    据报纸消息说，最近有一个名叫鲁多利弗·维特的捷克斯洛伐克公民到捷克斯洛伐克公安机关自首了。他在出差去西德汉堡的时候被英国间谍机关召募去干破坏活动。他说他不敢执行那种势将造成伤亡事件的破坏任务，因此自首。
    捷克斯洛伐克国家公安机关宣布逮捕了间谍和破坏分子马雷和加鲁沙卡，他们是过去逃往西德去的。他们在西德经过特务训练，就被派到捷克斯洛伐克，他们接受的任务是收集军事情报，纵火焚烧工厂和统一农业合作社的房子，制造混乱。
    此外，捷克斯洛伐克国家公安机关还扣留好几起间谍和破坏分子。这些人即将在法庭上受审。
