Heilongjiang State-Owned Farms Turn Over 150,000 Tons of Grain to the State
Some Farms Still Achieve Large-Scale Bumper Harvests After Suffering from Floods

(Our newspaper reports) More than 300 trucks and hundreds of large carts from thirty-five state-owned farms in Heilongjiang Province are fully loaded with wheat, soybeans, and other grains, traveling day and night on the fields along the Xing'an Mountains and the Songhua River, delivering grain to the state. This year, most of the grain crops on state-owned farms in Heilongjiang Province have had a bumper harvest. After setting aside seeds needed for planting more than 270,000 hectares of land next year, as well as food for employees and feed for livestock, the farms are expected to turn over a total of 150,000 tons of grain to the state, more than double the total amount of grain turned over last year, and more than any previous year.

This year, Heilongjiang Province suffered relatively severe natural disasters. From July onwards, there was continuous rain for three months, which affected the normal growth of crops. Some state-owned farms suffered from floods, and large areas of crops were submerged. However, because state-owned farms implemented mechanized farming, adopted advanced agricultural technologies, expanded the area of fertilization, strengthened field management, and especially with the close support and cooperation of various departments, coupled with the planting of superior varieties and good harvesting work, the yield per unit area of various crops could reach and exceed the highest yield levels in the past; and because the planting area was expanded, the total output increased by 1.1 times compared with last year. Some farms have also achieved large-scale bumper harvests. The nearly 10,000 hectares of spring wheat planted by the Jiu San Farm, despite relatively severe natural disasters, still achieved a high yield of over 1,700 kilograms per hectare, which is more than 60% higher than the average yield of local farmers.

    黑龙江国营农场上缴十五万吨粮食给国家
    遭受水灾后有些农场仍获得大面积丰产
    本报讯　黑龙江省三十五个国营农场的三百多辆汽车和数百辆大车，正在满载着小麦、大豆等粮食，昼夜不停地奔驰在兴安岭边、松花江畔的原野上，向国家交运粮食。今年黑龙江省国营农场粮谷作物大部分获得丰收，各场除留下明年播种二十七万多公顷面积所需的种子及职工食粮和牲畜饲料外，预计共可上缴十五万吨粮食给国家，超过去年上缴粮食总数一倍以上，比历年来上缴的粮食都多。
    今年黑龙江省的自然灾害较重，从七月份起，三个来月一直霪雨连绵，影响了作物的正常生长。有些国营农场遭受水灾，大面积的作物被淹没。但是由于国营农场实行机械化耕作，采用了先进的农业技术，扩大了施肥面积，加强了田间管理，特别是在各部门的密切支援配合下再加上播种的是优良品种和做好了收获工作，所以各种作物的单位面积产量都能达到和超过过去最高产量水平；并且因为播种面积扩大，总产量就比去年增加一点一倍。有些农场还获得了大面积的丰收，九三农场播种的近万公顷春小麦，在自然灾害较重的情况下，还获得了平均每公顷一千七百多公斤的高额产量，比当地农民平均产量高出60％多。
