Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th: In recent days, in rural areas across Liaoning Province, thousands upon thousands of large vehicles, fully loaded with grain, have been going to state grain stations to sell grain.

The total grain crop yield in Liaoning Province this year will reach eight million tons, an increase of 30% compared to last year. Agricultural production cooperatives that have achieved a bumper harvest, after setting aside enough grain for their members' annual consumption, livestock feed, and necessary reserves, plan to sell more and better surplus grain to the state. Tutaizi Township in Haicheng County, which had suffered from years of disasters, saw its total grain output nearly double compared to last year. All agricultural cooperatives in the township decided that, in addition to fulfilling the state grain purchase quota according to the "Three Fixes" policy, they would also sell more than one million jin of the 2.5 million jin of extra grain produced this year to the state. The new grain received by grain stations in Lingyuan County since October 5th has been mostly of medium to high quality. The 100,000 jin of public grain delivered by the Hongda Cooperative in Sanjiazi District was all of superior quality.

    千车万车卖余粮
    新华社沈阳28日电　辽宁省各地农村近日来每天都有成千上万台大车满载着粮食，到国家粮站出售。
    辽宁省今年粮谷作物总产量将达到八百万吨，比去年增产30％。获得丰收的农业生产合作社，除了留够社员一年食用和牲畜饲料以及必要的储备粮以外，都计划把更多更好的余粮卖给国家。过去连年受灾的海城县土台子乡，今年粮谷总产量比去年增产近两倍，全乡各农业社决定除按“三定”政策完成征购粮任务以外，还要把今年超额增产的二百五十万斤粮食，再卖给国家一百多万斤。凌源县各粮站从10月5日开始接收的新粮，质量大部分都是中上等的。三十家子区红大社送交的十万斤公粮，质量全部都是上等。
