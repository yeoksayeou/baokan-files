Our country has a precise "constant temperature room"

    (Our newspaper) News: The "constant temperature room" used to measure the precision of various machines and instruments has been successfully designed and manufactured by Deng Handing, director and engineer of the Hua's Ventilation Factory of the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau's joint public-private construction company. Its accuracy has reached plus or minus 0.5 degrees Celsius, approaching international standards.
    The "constant temperature room" is a small room of twenty-five square meters, equipped with constant temperature and humidity equipment, so that the room maintains a certain temperature and humidity throughout the year. Because various substances have the property of thermal expansion and contraction, precision is often difficult to accurately check. With the "constant temperature room," various machines and instruments can be measured under the same temperature and humidity to accurately check whether various machines and instruments have reached the required precision. Therefore, the successful design and manufacture of this "constant temperature room" plays a significant role in ensuring that the quality of mechanical products reaches international standards as soon as possible.

    我国有了精确的“恒温室”
    本报讯　用以测量各种机器和仪器精密度的“恒温室”，已由北京市建筑工程局公私合营建筑公司华氏通风工厂厂长兼工程师邓汉定设计和制造成功。它的精确度已达到摄氏正负0.5度，已接近国际标准。
    “恒温室”就是在一间面积二十五平方公尺的小屋内，安装上恒温恒湿设备，使这个屋子在一年中始终保持一定的温度和湿度。由于各种物质都有热涨冷缩的性能，所以精密度往往不容易精确地检查出来。有了“恒温室”，各种机器和仪器就可以在同一温湿度下进行测量，精确地检查出各种机器和仪器是否已达到所要求的精密度来。因此，这种“恒温室”的设计和制造成功，对保证机械产品质量早日达到国际水平起着重大作用。
