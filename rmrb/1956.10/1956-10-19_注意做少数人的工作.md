    Pay Attention to the Work of the Minority
    Xing Huan
    Party organizations should regularly understand the ideological situation of each Party member and conduct education tailored to specific circumstances, so that everyone can always maintain full enthusiasm and creativity and strive to complete the tasks they should complete. This principle is known to all Party organizations. However, not all Party organizations do this and do it well. The practice of the Communist Party branch of Zhuangli Township, Qidong County, in paying attention to mobilizing the enthusiasm of all Party members, which is introduced today, provides a successful example in this regard.

    The Communist Party branch of Zhuangli Township has a total of one hundred and four Party members, most of whom are very active in their work, with only twenty-five Party members who are not very active. In this situation, the Communist Party branch of Zhuangli Township was not satisfied with the situation of "the vast majority of Party members are active and working hard," and did not therefore neglect the very few less active Party members. Instead, they carefully analyzed the reasons why these twenty-five Party members were not very active, and then conducted education in light of their ideological situation, admitting the shortcomings of the branch in handling certain issues improperly in the past and not caring and educating everyone enough. They tried to help Party members with practical difficulties in life and production solve their difficulties. For the few Party members who had ideological barriers or opinions on the leadership, they adopted the method of individual "heart-to-heart talks" to eliminate barriers and opinions. These practices produced good results: twenty-three of the twenty-five Party members who were not active in their work have undergone significant changes, and fourteen of them have assumed leadership positions in the branch and cooperative.

    The experience of the Zhuangli Township Party branch shows that it is not enough to only see the majority and not the minority, and only do the work of the majority and not the work of the minority. In fact, as far as the majority of highly conscious Party members are concerned, even if the Party organization provides less education and assistance to them, they will spontaneously work actively. What Party organizations need to help with specifically is the minority of Party members who are less conscious or have other difficulties. Only by seeing the majority and taking care of the minority, and especially doing work in a thorough and meticulous manner for the minority, can we promote all positive factors and do our work better.

    注意做少数人的工作
    星环
    党组织应该经常了解每一个党员的思想情况，并针对具体情况进行教育，使大家经常保持饱满的积极性和创造性，努力地完成自己应完成的任务。这个道理，是一切党组织都知道的。但是，并不是所有的党组织都这样做而且做得很好。今天介绍的中共齐东县状李乡支部注意调动一切党员积极性的做法，在这方面提供了一个成功的范例。
    中共状李乡支部一共有一百零四名党员，其中大部分党员工作都很积极，只有二十五名党员工作不积极。在这种情况下，中共状李乡支部，没有满足于“绝大多数党员都积极努力”的情况，没有因此就忽视极少数不大积极的党员，而是认真分析了这二十五名党员积极性不高的原因，然后联系他们的思想情况进行了教育，承认了支部过去对某些问题处理不当和对大家关心、教育不够的缺点；对生活、生产上有实际困难的党员设法帮助他们解决了困难；对少数思想上有隔阂、对领导上有意见的党员，更采取了个别“谈心”的办法，消除隔阂和意见。这些做法产生了良好的效果：二十五名工作不积极的党员，有二十三名已有显著转变，其中十四名已担任了支部和合作社的领导职务。
    状李乡党支部的经验说明：只看到多数，看不到少数，只做多数人的工作，不做少数人的工作，是不够的。事实上，在多数觉悟较高的党员说来，即使党组织对他们的教育和帮助较少，他们也会自发地积极工作。更为需要党组织具体帮助的，正是少数的觉悟较低或有其他困难的党员。只有既看到多数，又照顾到少数，并且特别深入细致地对少数做工作，才能发扬一切积极因素，把我们的工作做得更好。
