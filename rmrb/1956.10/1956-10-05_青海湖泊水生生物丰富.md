    Qinghai Lake Abounds in Aquatic Life

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The lake survey team from the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences collected more than 5,000 fish fry of various sizes and more than 1,000 bottles of aquatic biological specimens in Qinghai Lake and its surrounding areas, proving that the lakes in Qinghai Province are rich in aquatic life.

    The lake survey team arrived in Qinghai in late July. After completing their outdoor collection work in Qinghai Province, they returned to Wuhan on September 15 to prepare for indoor research and analysis of these fish fry and aquatic biological specimens.

    The lake survey team discovered many lower aquatic plants such as charophytes, red algae, and yellow algae, as well as lower aquatic animals such as copepods and ostracods, in the Da Lama River and its surrounding areas. The head of the survey team, Li Shanghao, said: Qinghai Province is extremely rich in aquatic life. Among the lakes we have surveyed across the country, the number of lower aquatic plants such as charophytes, red algae, and yellow algae discovered is very small. These aquatic plants discovered in the Da Lama River have high research value.

    青海湖泊水生生物丰富
    新华社讯　中国科学院水生生物研究所湖泊调查队在青海湖和湖区采集到各种大小鱼苗五千多个和水生生物标本一千多瓶，证明青海省湖泊水生生物丰富。
    湖泊调查队是在7月下旬到青海的，他们在完成青海省的室外采集工作后，已在9月15日回武汉，准备对这些鱼苗和水生生物标本进行室内的研究、分析工作。
    湖泊调查队在大喇嘛河和湖区发现很多轮藻、红藻、黄藻等低等水生植物和桡足类、介形类等低等水生动物。调查队的负责人黎尚豪说：青海省的水生生物极为丰富。在我们所调查过的全国湖泊中，发现的轮藻、红藻和黄藻等低等水生植物数量很少。在大喇嘛河发现的这些水生植物具有很高的研究价值。
