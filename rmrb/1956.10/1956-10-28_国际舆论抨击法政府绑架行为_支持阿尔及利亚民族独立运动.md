    Indonesian Newspapers Strongly Condemn
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 27th: The "Indonesian Torch" newspaper published a commentary today stating that the French kidnapping of five Algerian leaders shows that the imperialists have lost their rationality in maintaining their own interests. The newspaper said that this incident is a despicable act by the French rulers and also a suicidal action. If the French rulers think that this will extinguish the flames of the Algerian people's struggle for national independence, they are gravely mistaken. The Algerian people's movement for national independence will never stop.
      The "Independence Daily" said that Algeria has the right to independence. This is something that France cannot deny for any reason. The Algerian people, supported by all the people of Asia and Africa, will continue their struggle until final victory.

    国际舆论抨击法政府绑架行为
    支持阿尔及利亚民族独立运动
    突尼斯议会通过决议
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：突尼斯民族立宪议会10月25日通过了一项决议，表示拥护政府的政策，并且表示突尼斯人民决心反抗“破坏突尼斯的领土完整和主权的法军的侵略”。议会要求政府继续努力，争取法国军队撤出突尼斯，并且表示“突尼斯人民全力支持阿尔及利亚人民的英雄斗争”。
    在议会这一天的会议上突尼斯首相布尔吉巴就一般政策问题作了说明，并且特别谈到突尼斯和摩洛哥的关系。他说，在不久前同摩洛哥苏丹举行的会议上，双方曾经对摩洛哥和突尼斯的合作联盟协定的主要条款取得一致意见。这个协定的有效期间将为二十年。
    摩洛哥宣布召回驻法大使
    新华社26日讯　拉巴特消息：摩洛哥外交部10月25日宣布，它将立即召回它的驻法国大使阿卜拉勒拉希姆·布阿比德。自从法国劫持阿尔及利亚民族领袖以后，摩洛哥和法国的关系一直很紧张。
    阿拉伯国家一片抗议声
    据新华社讯　阿拉伯国家强烈抗议法国绑架阿尔及利亚民族解放运动领导人。
    叙利亚外交部长比塔尔就这件事向法国驻叙利亚大使递交了一份照会，谴责“法国人的专横和对国际法的破坏”。
    黎巴嫩外交部办公厅主任法德·阿蒙向法国驻黎巴嫩大使罗歇表示抗议绑架阿尔及利亚领导人，并且要求释放他们。黎巴嫩议会25日一致通过决议，坚决谴责法国在阿尔及利亚的行为，特别是逮捕阿尔及利亚领导人的行为。
    约旦外交大臣阿卜杜勒·哈迪24日会见了法国、英国和美国驻约旦大使，就法国当局绑架阿尔及利亚民族解放运动领袖一事向他们表示正式的抗议。约旦议会在25日通过了一项决议，建议政府召回约旦驻巴黎大使，以对法国当局逮捕“阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线”的领袖表示抗议。同时，约旦各政党已经打电报给联合国，对这件事提出抗议。
    约旦首都安曼10月24日举行了群众示威游行，抗议法国当局在阿尔及利亚的行动。
    利比亚外交部在声明中着重指出，法国政府的行动是“违反国际法、违反互相谅解和和平的精神的”。利比亚参议院议长穆罕默德·布希德马打电报给联合国秘书长，要求他干预这个事件，以使被捕的阿尔及利亚领导人尽早得到释放，并且请求他支持阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争。布希德马同时打电报给法国国民议会，表示抗议。
    巴基斯坦政界领袖表示愤怒
    据新华社卡拉奇26日电　巴基斯坦各党派北非委员会的创建人穆赫塔·拉吉10月25日在卡拉奇发表声明说，法国政府在苏伊士运河问题上遭到的失败已经使它疯狂了。他说，但是这“只会促进阿尔及利亚的解放运动和使他们得到整个北非和亚非国家的更多的积极支持”。
    卡拉奇人民联盟执行委员会委员查法·里兹维在一篇指责法国绑架五个阿尔及利亚民族运动领袖的声明中，吁请所有的联合国成员国加以干涉，使这五个人获得释放和制止阿尔及利亚的流血。
    印度尼西亚报纸强烈谴责
    据新华社雅加达27日电　“印度尼西亚火炬报”今天发表评论说：法国绑架五位阿尔及利亚领袖一事表明，帝国主义分子在保持自己利益方面，已经丧失了理性。这家报纸说，这次事件是法国统治者的卑鄙行径，也是他们的自杀行动。如果法国统治者以为这样做就能扑灭阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的火焰，他们就大错特错了。阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的运动是决不会停止的。
      “独立报”说，阿尔及利亚有权取得独立。这是法国不能以任何理由来否认的。受到全体亚非人民支持的阿尔及利亚人民将继续他们的斗争，直到取得最后胜利为止。
