    State-Owned Factories and Joint State-Private Factories Help and Learn from Each Other
    Shanghai's Sixteen Wool Textile Factories Improve Management Level
    (Our Newspaper) Shanghai's thirteen joint state-private wool textile factories, including Yuanfeng, Yuhua, Huitong, and Yinfeng, have been gradually improving their management level and achieving better production results month by month since signing inter-factory mutual assistance and learning contracts with the state-owned Shanghai No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 Wool Textile Factories in February and March this year.
    Of the sixteen factories that signed contracts, eight factories completed all four indicators (output value, output, first-class product rate, and labor productivity) in the first quarter, ten in the second quarter, and eleven in August. The first-class product rate of worsted wool fabrics in these factories has increased from 50%-70% to around 98%, with the lowest being above 90%. In the past six months, four joint state-private factories have approached the level of advanced factories, and eight have reached the level of medium-sized factories.
    Inter-factory mutual assistance and learning organizations are voluntarily organized according to the same products and similar regions.
    Inter-factory mutual assistance and learning includes production, management, office work, trade union work, and even nursery and kitchen work. When state-owned factories introduce their management experience, some adopt the method of giving large lectures, while others send special personnel to joint venture factories to help solve specific problems. For example, in late July, the weaving workshop of the joint venture Xinhua Lun Wool Textile Factory produced a large number of weft stop defects, and the woven grey fabric was uneven in density. After learning about this, the state-owned No. 3 Wool Textile Factory and joint state-private factories such as Yinfeng and Zhanghua organized technicians to help the next day, overcoming the weft stop phenomenon and restoring the first-class product rate to over 90%.
    The newly established joint venture Yinfeng Wool Textile Factory originally had no planned management system at all. Now, work plans have been implemented to the level of teams and groups, and each worker has begun to have their own production targets. Before May this year, the earlier established joint venture Zhanghua Wool Textile Factory often had more than one-third of its monthly production tasks pushed to the end of the month. After the implementation of work plans, it can now almost achieve balanced production every day.
    State-owned factories also go to joint venture factories to learn. In the past six months, the state-owned No. 2 Wool Textile Factory has sent 111 person-times to joint venture factories to learn, and has learned a lot of experience. Once, when helping the joint venture China Wool Textile Factory improve the quality of woolen yarn, it was found that the China Wool Textile Factory's experience in weighing woolen yarn by gram was very good. Learning this experience solved its own long-standing problem of woolen yarn weight being too light.
    The form of inter-factory mutual assistance and learning is very good, and it fully embodies the spirit of the advanced leading the backward. This method can make the learning object fixed, which is convenient for joint venture factories to learn the production and management experience of socialist enterprises in a planned and in-depth manner. The learning methods are flexible and diverse, and are not limited by form, achieving "supplementing what is lacking." With a contract, the sense of responsibility of state-owned factories to help joint venture factories is strengthened. Before the signing of the contract, the earlier established joint venture factories had requested to send people to state-owned factories to learn, but were often restricted by "approval from the主管局 (managing bureau)" or "confidentiality," etc. Even if they went through a lot of procedures to visit state-owned factories, they were not allowed to take notes. Therefore, joint venture factories generally felt that "learning is difficult" and the learning effect was not great. Some joint venture factories were also unwilling to learn from state-owned factories. After the inter-factory mutual assistance and learning contract was signed, those artificial barriers were eliminated. Now, as long as there is a phone call, people can be sent to learn or visit each other.

### 国营工厂同公私合营工厂互助互学  上海十六个毛纺织厂管理水平提高

    国营工厂同公私合营工厂互助互学
    上海十六个毛纺织厂管理水平提高
    本报讯　上海公私合营元丰、裕华、汇通、寅丰等十三个毛纺织厂，从今年二、三月份，分别跟国营上海第一、二、三毛纺织厂签订厂际互助互学合同以来，管理水平逐步提高，生产成绩一月比一月好。
    签订合同的十六个厂，在第一季度完成四项指标的（产值，产量，质量一等品率和劳动生产率）有八个厂，第二季度有十个厂，8月份有十一个厂。这些厂的精纺毛织品的一等品率已经从50％—70％上升到98％左右，最低的也在90％以上。半年来已经有四个公私合营工厂接近先进厂的水平，八个厂达到中等厂的水平。
    厂际互助互学组织，都是按照产品相同，地区相近自愿组织起来的。
    厂际互助互学，包括生产、管理、科室工作、工会工作，以至于托儿所、厨房等等工作。国营厂在介绍自己的管理经验的时候，有的采取上大课的方法，有时派专门人员到合营厂去，帮助解决具体问题。例如7月下旬，合营新华纶毛纺织厂织造车间大量出纬挡次品，织出来的毛坯布稀密不匀。国营第三毛纺织厂和公私合营的寅丰，章华等厂知道以后，第二天就组织技术人员去帮助，克服了纬挡现象，使一等品又重新恢复到90％以上。
    新合营的寅丰毛纺织厂原来根本没有计划管理制度，现在作业计划已经推行到班、组，每个工人也都开始有了自己的生产指标。合营较早的章华毛纺织厂，今年5月以前，每月还经常有三分之一以上的生产任务要推到月末去完成，推行作业计划以后，现在差不多做到能够每天均衡的进行生产了。
    国营厂也到合营厂学习，半年来，国营第二毛纺织厂到合营厂去学习一百十一人次，学来了不少的经验。有一次帮助合营中国毛纺织厂改进绒线质量的时候，发现中国毛纺织厂绒线分克过磅的经验很好，学习这项经验，恰好解决了自己长期以来没有解决的绒线重量偏轻的问题。
    厂际互助互学的形式很好，它充分体现了先进带动落后的精神。这种方法可以使学习对象固定，便于合营厂有计划地深入地学习社会主义企业的生产管理经验。学习方式灵活多样，不拘形式，做到了“缺啥补啥”。有了合同，加强了国营厂帮助合营厂的责任感。签订合同之前，合营较早的工厂曾经有派人到国营厂学习的要求，但是往往“要经过主管局的批准”，或者“保密”等的限制，即使费了很多手续到国营厂参观，也不准作记录。因而一般合营厂都感到“学习难”，学习效果不大。合营的厂子中也有不肯向国营厂学习的。厂际互助互学合同签订以后，过去那些人为的隔阂消除了。现在，只要一个电话，就可以互相派人学习或参观。
