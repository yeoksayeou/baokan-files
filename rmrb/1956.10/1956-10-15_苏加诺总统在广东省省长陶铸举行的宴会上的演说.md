Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 13th: President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia delivered a speech today at a banquet hosted by Tao Zhu, Governor of Guangdong Province. The full text is as follows:

    Brothers and sisters,
    Friends,
    Comrades:

    First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the people of Guangdong for the welcome extended to me and my entourage. (Applause) Secondly, I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to Governor Tao for, like others, excessively praising my contributions to the struggle for my country's independence in his speech. The main content of my speech now is to bid farewell to the people of the People's Republic of China, especially the government of the People's Republic of China. Because after delivering a speech to the youth of Guangdong tomorrow morning, I will leave Guangdong with my entourage, passing through Kunming and heading back to my country via Yangon.

    I truly thank Allah for being able to visit the People's Republic of China, especially during a very important period in the history of the People's Republic of China, even in world history and in my own history. This is because the current period is a time when the people of the whole world are uniting in the struggle to destroy colonialism and imperialism. I am very firmly convinced that imperialism is bound to be completely defeated! (Warm applause)

    This is a very important period in Chinese history because this period is a period of transition for the Chinese people. At present, the Chinese people have broken away from the old era, an era full of sorrow, death, and hardship, and entered a new era. In this new era, the Chinese people are creating their beautiful future, a happy future, a free future, a future of sharing peace with all the nations of the world. We are now in an era of great changes in the world, an era when the bright and glorious sun shines on all mankind in the world. Shouldn't we be overjoyed to live in such an era?

    In order to deeply appreciate this point, let us recall the lives of our ancestors in the past. At that time, no major changes occurred in the world, and the ancestors seemed to live in a stagnant era. However, we now live in the twentieth century, and our generation has encountered an era of drastic historical changes. This is the great change of the twentieth century. As I have said, it has three characteristics:

    First, in the twentieth century, a number of socialist countries were established.

    Second, in the twentieth century, the people of Asia and Africa have all risen up and united together, launching a very fierce struggle to attack colonialism and imperialism. As I said just now, I am deeply convinced that the day will come when there will be no more colonialism and imperialism in the world! (Warm applause)

    The third characteristic is that the twentieth century has produced new science, namely atomic science. We, the progressive people of the whole world, are currently striving to prevent this atomic science from bringing disaster to mankind, but instead bringing happiness, prosperity, well-being, and peace. We, the progressive people of the whole world, are united to oppose all attempts to use the atom as a weapon of war to harm mankind. (Warm applause)

    I repeat again, I am very happy to be able to visit the People's Republic of China at this historically significant moment, which has great significance not only in world history but also in the history of the great transformation of the People's Republic of China. I deeply and firmly believe that the Chinese people will surely be victorious in burying the old era full of suffering and in building a bright and splendid new world on Chinese soil. (Applause) The reason why I say that the Chinese people will surely be victorious in the construction cause is because during these fourteen days of visits, I have personally seen how abundant resources are on Chinese soil. The Chinese people rely on these resources to build their future on an unprecedented scale. However, in addition to those resources, I also saw that the Chinese nation possesses a wealth that is more precious than resources, a wealth that is more precious than everything else, and that is the people, six hundred million people, fighting people, labor-loving people, hardworking people, independence-loving people, and united people. Brothers and sisters, with such people, I say that victory must belong to the Chinese people. (Warm applause)

    I know that there are some groups that do not like the People's Republic of China, and some groups that hate the People's Republic of China. However, in these two weeks, I have said three times that with such people, six hundred million people, people who love independence, fight bravely, work diligently, endure hardship, and are united, united under unified leadership, such people will not perish, will not be defeated, they will surely exist forever! (Warm applause)

    Brothers and sisters, we are preparing to leave the People's Republic of China the day after tomorrow. During our stay in the People's Republic of China, we have been welcomed with brotherly love, and in these days, we have been completely immersed in close and intimate brotherly love. Brothers and sisters, how can we forget this brotherly love? How can we forget the loving gazes of the Chinese people, the love of the Chinese people for our group, which is actually love for the eighty-two million Indonesian people. How can we forget the Chinese children who sang and hugged us in front of us. How can we forget all this! Brothers and sisters, if I consider it more deeply, we better not forget all this. We will always deeply miss you. (Warm applause)

    Brothers and sisters, I hereby bid farewell to you tonight, wishing the people of the People's Republic of China eternal prosperity and wishing the people of the People's Republic of China complete independence. After my words are translated into Chinese, I ask everyone to stand up and raise a glass together:

    To the prosperity and strength of the People's Republic of China! (Warm applause)

    To the close and intimate friendship between the People's Republic of China and Indonesia! (Warm applause)

    A toast to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong!

    苏加诺总统在广东省省长陶铸举行的宴会上的演说
    新华社广州13日电　印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺今天在广东省省长陶铸举行的宴会上发表演说。全文如下：
    兄弟姐妹们，
    朋友们，
    同志们：
    首先，我要对广东人民对我和我的随行人员的欢迎，表示万分的感谢。（鼓掌）其次，对于广东省省长先生像其他地方那样，在讲话中过于赞扬我在争取祖国独立斗争中的功绩，我也要表示万分的感谢。我现在发表的演说，内容主要是向中华人民共和国的人民，特别是中华人民共和国政府辞行。因为我在明天早晨向广东青年发表演说之后，就要和我的随行人员离开广东，取道昆明经仰光回国。
    我真要感谢真主，因为我能够访问中华人民共和国，特别是在中华人民共和国历史上，甚至是在世界历史上以及我的历史上的非常重要的时期访问中华人民共和国。这是因为现时是全世界的人民在摧毁殖民主义和帝国主义的斗争中团结起来的时期。我十分坚定的深信，帝国主义是必然要彻底溃灭的！
  （热烈鼓掌）
    这是中国历史上非常重要的时期，因为这一个时期是中国人民的过渡时期，现时，中国人民摆脱了旧的时代，一个充满悲哀、死难和困苦的时代，进入一个新的时代，在这个新时代里，中国人民创造他们美好的将来，幸福的将来，自由的将来，一个与全世界各民族共享和平的将来。我们现在这一个时代，是世界大变动的时代，灿烂光辉的太阳照耀着全世界的人类的时代，我们生活在这样的时代里，难道不应该兴高采烈吗？
    为要深入的体会这一点，大家试回想过去我们的先辈的生活。那时，世界上并没有发生过什么重大的变化，过去的先辈就像是生活在一个停滞的时代。可是，我们现时生活在二十世纪，我们这一代碰上了剧烈变动的历史时代，这是二十世纪的大变动，我曾经说过，它具有三个特点：
    第一、二十世纪成立了好些社会主义国家。
    第二、在二十世纪里，亚非人民全都起来了，而且团结在一起，发动非常激烈的斗争，向殖民主义和帝国主义进攻。刚才我说过，我深信，世界上再也没有殖民主义和帝国主义这样的一天就要到来的！
  （热烈鼓掌）
    第三个特点是，二十世纪产生了新的科学，即原子科学。我们全世界的进步人类目前正努力使这种原子科学不致给人类带来灾难，而是带来幸福、繁荣、康乐和安宁。我们全世界的进步人民团结起来反对一切企图把原子当做战争的武器来祸害人类的勾当。（热烈鼓掌）
    我再重说一遍，我感到非常高兴能在这个具有历史意义的时刻访问中华人民共和国，这个时刻不仅在世界历史上而且在中华人民共和国的大转变的历史上都具有重大的意义。我深深地、坚定不移地相信，中国人民在埋葬旧的充满着苦难的时代和在中国土地上建立光辉灿烂的新世界的事业中必将获得胜利。（鼓掌）我之所以说中国人民在建设事业中必将获得胜利是因为在这十四天的访问中我亲眼看到在中国的土地上有着多么丰富的资源。中国人民依靠这些资源以空前的规模建设他们的未来。然而，除了那些资源之外，我还看到中华民族拥有一种比资源更宝贵的财富，比一切都要宝贵的财富，那就是人民，六亿之众的人民，战斗的人民、热爱劳动的人民、辛勤劳动的人民、热爱独立的人民、团结一致的人民。兄弟姐妹们，有了这样的人民，我说，胜利一定属于中国人民。（热烈鼓掌）
    我知道，有一些集团不喜欢中华人民共和国，有一些集团仇视中华人民共和国。可是，在这两个星期里，我已经说过三遍，有了这样的人民，六亿的人民，热爱独立，英勇战斗，勤力工作，不辞劳苦，团结一致，团结在统一的领导下的人民，这样的人民是不会灭亡的，不会溃灭的，他们一定会永世长存！
  （热烈鼓掌）
    兄弟姐妹们，我们准备明后天就离开中华人民共和国。我们逗留在中华人民共和国的日子里，备受兄弟般的友爱的欢迎，在这些日子里，我们完全浸沉在亲密无间的兄弟般的友爱里。兄弟姐妹们，我们怎能忘掉这种兄弟般的友爱。我们怎能忘掉中国人民充满着友爱的目光，中国人民对我们这一行人的友爱，其实是对八千二百万印度尼西亚人民的友爱。我们怎能忘掉在我们面前唱歌、拥抱我们的中国小孩们。我们怎能忘掉这一切！兄弟姐妹们，要是我更深入地考虑，我们最好不要忘掉这一切。我们将永远深深地怀念着你们。（热烈鼓掌）
    兄弟姐妹们，我今晚谨此向你们告别，祝中华人民共和国的人民永远繁荣，祝中华人民共和国的人民取得完全的独立。等我的话译成中国话之后，我要求大家起立，共同举杯
    为中华人民共和国的繁荣和昌盛，（热烈鼓掌）
    为中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚的亲密无间的友谊，（热烈鼓掌）
    为毛泽东主席的健康干杯！
