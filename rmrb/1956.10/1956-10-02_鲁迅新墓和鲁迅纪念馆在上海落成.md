Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th - Lu Xun's new tomb and Lu Xun Memorial Hall were completed on the 29th. A grand ceremony to move the tomb will be held in mid-October.

    Lu Xun's new tomb is built in the northwest corner of Hongkou Park. From afar, one can see the massive wall-like tombstone behind the tomb, inscribed with Chairman Mao's own handwriting: "The Tomb of Mr. Lu Xun." The entire tomb is made of cobblestones. Two tall magnolias have been planted in front of the tomb. The two Chinese junipers planted by Premier Zhou Enlai and Ms. Xu Guangping in front of Lu Xun's tomb in the International Cemetery will be transplanted on both sides of the tomb. Grape trellises are built on both sides of the tomb, and *Viburnum suspensum*, oleanders, and other flowers and trees that Mr. Lu Xun loved during his lifetime will be planted. The statue base in front of the tomb has been completed. The full-body seated statue of Mr. Lu Xun, modified and finalized by sculptor Xiao Chuanjiu, will soon be placed on the statue base. The statue is 2.1 meters high.

    To the southeast of Lu Xun's tomb is a two-story building in the Jiangnan style - the Lu Xun Memorial Hall. The roof is covered with blue cylindrical tiles, and there are horse-head gable walls on both sides. The building includes ten exhibition rooms, two rest rooms, and a screening room that can accommodate two hundred people to watch movies. Lu Xun's works, photographs, and his belongings will be displayed here. The five exhibition rooms upstairs will display Mr. Lu Xun's works and related materials from his last ten years in Shanghai. Here, there is a strategic map of the Red Army drawn for Mr. Lu Xun by General Chen Geng. This historically significant document is what General Chen Geng drew for Mr. Lu Xun when he met with Mr. Lu Xun in Shanghai in 1932. This precious document was discovered in Mr. Lu Xun's books a few months ago.

    鲁迅新墓和鲁迅纪念馆在上海落成
    新华社上海30日电　鲁迅新墓和鲁迅纪念馆29日落成，10月中旬将举行隆重的迁墓仪式。
    鲁迅新墓筑在虹口公园西北隅。在很远的地方，就可望见墓穴后面巨大的墙式墓碑，碑上刻着毛主席的亲笔题字：“鲁迅先生之墓”。整个墓地是用花石岗砌成的。墓穴前面已栽上两棵高大的广玉兰。周恩来总理和许广平女士在万国公墓鲁迅墓前种的两棵桧柏，将移植在墓穴两旁。墓地两侧砌有葡萄架，并将种植水横枝、夹竹桃等鲁迅先生生前喜爱的花卉树木。墓前像座已经建成，经过雕塑家萧传玖修改定型的鲁迅先生全身坐像，不久将安放在像座上。像高二点一公尺。
    在鲁迅墓地东南边，是一幢具有江南风格的两层楼建筑物——鲁迅纪念馆。屋面用青圆筒瓦盖成，两旁有马头式的山墙。建筑物包括有十个展览室，二个休息室和一个可容二百人观看电影的放映室。这里将陈列鲁迅先生的作品、照片和他的遗物。楼上五间展览室将展出鲁迅先生最后在上海十年中的著作和有关材料。这里，有一幅陈赓将军为鲁迅先生画的红军作战略图。这个具有历史意义的文献材料，是陈赓将军1932年在上海和鲁迅先生会见时画给鲁迅先生看的。这个珍贵的文献是几个月前在鲁迅先生的书籍中发现的。
