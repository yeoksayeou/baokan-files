    Weekend on a Warship
    Sailor Bi Kunshan
    In August, on a sunny Saturday afternoon, many warships in the East Sea ended a week of training and successively anchored on the sea near Hutou Mountain. The tight anchoring defense formation made the fleet's lineup look very majestic. The warships slowly turned their bows with the changes in the tide, sometimes forming a line abreast, sometimes a bearing line, and sometimes a column, orderly and beautiful.
    After dinner, the sailors took off their greasy work clothes, ran to the bathroom for a good wash, shaved as usual, and prepared to participate in the ship's weekend evening party.
    Before the party even started, the afterdeck was already packed with people, and it was lively. Some chatted with each other, while others were visiting the venue. The venue was simply arranged, without curtains or scenery. Two large, movable blackboards were set up on the left and right sides and the shield of the rear main gun, which together formed a "stage." Anything could be performed.
    Some sailors leaned on the ship's railings, appreciating the beautiful sea view. The sun had not yet set below the horizon, and the pale moon was already hanging obliquely in the east. The setting sun painted the white clouds red, and rays of light shot out from the gaps in the clouds. The azure sea reflected patches of golden light. Fishing boats loaded with harvest sailed towards distant fishing ports. How much the sailors loved the beautiful and rich ocean of their motherland! Some faced the sunset and began to sing softly. Flocks of snow-white seagulls circled over the warships. They sometimes flew quickly to the sea surface, picked up food, and flew up again. Their movements were so light and beautiful, and they cried so happily. The sailors all loved the seagulls. A sailor jokingly shouted, "Comrades, the party is starting!" The crowd on the afterdeck immediately quieted down, and everyone asked in unison, "Where? What's the program?" The sailor pointed to the sky and, imitating the voice of a female announcer, said: "The first program: 'Seagull Chorus', the first song: 'Song of Opening Canned Goods'" ("Opening canned goods" is an internal naval joke, referring to things vomited by people after seasickness floating on the sea, which seagulls compete to eat). Before he could finish, everyone burst into laughter.
    At this time, the club director, Deputy Political Commissar Wang, announced the start of the party, and the sailors quickly found places to sit down. The first program of the party was a chorus, the first song: "The Sun Sets." The ship's choir members were all young singers, and their magnificent voices flew to the distant ocean. The choir members, looking at the beautiful scenery of the sunset, sang with more and more enthusiasm. After three songs were sung in chorus, there were short programs, including solo tenor singing, harmonica ensemble, and accordion solo. Radar soldier Wang Yang had only been learning to play the accordion for more than two months. He was taught by comrades from the cultural troupe who had come to the ship not long ago. Because he was smart and willing to practice, he was now playing very well. He could not only play general songs, but also several waltzes. His performance of "The Nightingale" was very popular. His nimble fingers moved quickly on the keys, and everyone held their breath and listened quietly to his performance.
    The crosstalk performed by Sergeant Squad Leader Yan Nengyi and Seaman First Class Liu Yonghe was also very popular among the sailors. The name of the crosstalk was "Old Gunner." It satirized a gunner's mate named Li Ji, who showed off his seniority, did not study technology, and failed to meet the operating standards. However, he believed that he had been working on the main gun for two or three years and had some skills. In the campaign to "Create All-Around Gunners," he fell behind. The crosstalk vividly satirized Li Ji's embarrassment when he could not disassemble the breechblock or troubleshoot during the test. Finally, the tester—the gunnery officer—asked a sailor to troubleshoot it for him. The crosstalk powerfully educated those who did not like to study.
    After many short and wonderful programs, there was a free performance. Many veteran comrades encouraged new comrades to perform something, but most of the comrades who joined the army this year were always a little shy. A new Hunan soldier who usually liked to sing a few ditties was noticed at this time. He was invited and had no choice but to pluck up his courage and sing a section of the Hunan opera "Liu Hai Cuts Firewood." He ran down before he could finish the last sentence.
    The last program was "Friendship Dance." The large blackboard was removed, the long benches were arranged on both sides, and the afterdeck seemed very spacious. The sailors and officers danced lightly in pairs to the melody of the accordion. Night fell, and the sea breeze drove away the heat of the day. The sailors bathed in this cool sea breeze, and the melodious accordion music and the sailors' hearty laughter intertwined…

    军舰上的周末
    水兵　毕昆山
    八月，一个星期六的下午，天气晴朗。东海很多军舰结束了一周的训练，都先后停泊在虎头山附近的海面上。严密的停泊防御队形，显得舰队的阵容非常威严。军舰随着潮汐的变化缓慢地转动着舰首的方向，一会儿成了横队，一会儿又变成了方位队、纵队，又整齐，又好看。
    晚饭后，水兵们脱下了油垢的工作服，跑到浴室里去，痛痛快快地洗了个澡，照例洗脸刮胡子，准备参加舰上的周末晚会。
    晚会还没有开始，后甲板上已挤满了人，这里顿时热闹起来了，有的互相谈笑着，有的在参观晚会的会场。会场布置得很简单，没有帷幕，也没有布景，两块活动的大黑板报设在左右两舷和后主炮的防盾，夹起来正好构成了一个“台子”，“出将”“入相”的路子也有了。演什么都可以。
    有的水兵扶着舰的栏杆在欣赏美丽的海景，太阳还未坠下水平线，淡白色的月亮已斜挂在东方，夕阳将朵朵白云涂上了红色，万道霞光从云隙间射出来，蔚蓝色的海面映出片片金光，丰收的渔船驶向远方的渔港，水兵们多么喜爱祖国美丽富饶的海洋啊！有的面向着晚霞轻轻地唱起来。雪白的海鸥一群一群地盘旋在军舰的上空，它们有时急速飞向海面，衔起食物又飞起来，它们的动作是那样轻捷好看，它们叫的又那么愉快，水兵们都很喜爱海鸥。有个水兵开玩笑地喊道：“同志们，晚会开始了！”后甲板上的人群顿时静了下来，大家齐声地问：“在哪儿？什么节目？”那个水兵用手向空中一指，学着报幕女同志的声音：第一个节目：“海鸥小合唱”，第一个歌：“开罐头之歌”（“开罐头”是海军内部的笑谈，即人晕船后呕吐的东西漂于海上，海鸥争相食之）。没等他讲完，大家便哄然大笑起来。
    这时，俱乐部主任王副政委宣布晚会开始了，水兵们都迅速地找地方坐下来。晚会的第一个节目是大合唱，第一个歌：“太阳下山”。舰上的歌咏队都是青年歌手，他们雄壮的歌声飞向海洋的远方，歌咏队员们看着太阳下山的美景，越唱越起劲。合唱了三个歌曲之后，接着是小节目，有男高音独唱，口琴队合奏，手风琴独奏等。雷达兵汪洋学拉手风琴才两个多月，还是不久前文工团的同志来舰上时教他的，由于他聪明、肯练，现在已经拉得很好了，他不仅能拉一般歌曲，并且还能拉几个圆舞曲，这次他演奏的“百灵鸟”很受大家欢迎。他那灵巧的手指迅速地在琴键上跳动着，大家都屏住呼吸静听他的演奏。
    上士班长阎能毅和一等水兵刘永和两人编的相声，也最受水兵们的欢迎。相声的名字叫“老炮手”。它讽刺了一个枪炮下士李己满摆老资格，不钻研技术，达不到操作标准，但他却认为自己在主炮上干了两三年，有两下子了。在开展“创造万能炮手”的运动中，他掉了队。相声精彩地讽刺了李己满在测验排除故障时拆不开炮闩，排不除故障的狼狈像，最后测验人——枪炮长叫一个水兵给他排除了故障，相声有力地教育了那些不爱学习的人。
    许多短小精彩的节目演完后，是自由表演，很多老同志都鼓励新同志表演一个，但大多数今年新参军的同志总是有点怯场。有一个湖南新战士平时好唱几句小调，这时被大家注意，他被邀请不过，只得鼓足了勇气唱了一段湖南戏“刘海砍樵”，最后一句没等唱完就跑下来了。
    最后一个节目是“友谊舞”。大黑板报搬走了，长凳子排在两舷，后甲板显得很宽敞，水兵们、军官们一对对随着手风琴的旋律轻捷地跳起来。夜幕降下来了，海风赶走了白昼的暑气，水兵们沐浴在这凉爽的海风之中，悠扬的手风琴声和水兵们爽朗的笑声交织在一起……
