Reader's Letter

    Greetings to President Sukarno
    Dear President Sukarno:
    I am a printing worker, and I am honored to have participated in the work of reprinting your collection of paintings, which gave me the opportunity to see the beautiful and rich rivers and mountains of Indonesia, and to see the faces of many hardworking, kind, and brave people. It aroused my deeper love for the Indonesian people.
    Dear President, your speech denouncing colonialism spoke the common feelings of the Asian and African people. Your contributions to the struggle to defend world peace, safeguard national independence, and oppose colonialism have earned our sincere respect. Through your visit, the Chinese people and the Indonesian people will surely unite even further and move forward hand in hand! Beijing Fine Arts Printing Factory Worker

    Dear President Sukarno:
    How eagerly I have been waiting for the newspaper these past few days! Because the newspaper brings your voice, even the simplest sentence excites my heart. Listening to your speech is like hearing the call of the awakened Eastern nation. You are indeed the mouthpiece of the Indonesian people.
    Our two countries have both suffered from imperialist aggression and oppression, have both had a history of blood and tears, and have many common ideals, so every word you say gives us deep feelings. Chinese youth understand the value of international friendship. We don't need an inch of land or a drop of wealth from others, but we cherish any friendship from any side. Your friendly and enthusiastic speech moved me to tears. Our common destiny and aspirations unite the people of our two countries and form close comrades-in-arms on the front lines against colonialism and in defense of world peace.
Hangzhou　Lin Zhenhuan

    向苏加诺总统致意亲爱的苏加诺总统：
    我是个印刷工人，我荣幸地参加了翻印您的藏画集的工作，使我有机会看到印度尼西亚美丽、富饶的河山，看到许多勤劳、善良和勇敢人民的面貌，它激起了我对印度尼西亚人民更为深厚的友爱。
    亲爱的总统，您斥责殖民主义的演说，说出了亚非人民共同的心里话。您在保卫世界和平、维护民族独立、反对殖民主义的斗争中所作的贡献，使我们衷心地崇敬。通过您这次访问，中国人民和印度尼西亚人民必将更进一步团结起来，携手前进！　北京美术印刷厂工人
　殷幼芳亲爱的苏加诺总统：
    这几天，我是多么急迫地等待着报纸啊！因为报纸带来了您的声音，那怕是极简单的一句话，都激动着我的心弦。听了您的演说，就像听到觉悟了的东方民族的呼声一样，您确实是印度尼西亚人民的喉舌。
    我们两国都曾遭受过帝国主义的侵略与压迫，都有过血和泪的历史，并且有着许多共同的理想，所以您的每一句话都使我们有深刻的感触。中国青年懂得国际友爱的价值，我们不需要别人的一寸土地，一滴财富，但是，我们却十分珍惜来自任何一方的任何友谊。您充满友谊、热情洋溢的演说，使我激动得热泪夺眶而出。我们共同的命运和愿望，把两国人民联在一起，结成了反殖民主义、保卫世界和平战线上的亲密战友。杭州　林振寰
