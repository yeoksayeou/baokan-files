The resolution specifically mentioned the report by Food and Agriculture Department Secretary Thapar, who recently visited China, on the Chinese people's enthusiastic implementation of their Five-Year Plan. "The All India Kisan Sabha believes that if thorough land reform is realized here in India and the productive forces in agriculture are liberated, India can also achieve such brilliant achievements."
    The resolution on "Peasant Unity" put forward a twelve-point program as the basis for broad unity. The resolution put forward demands such as a three-year ban on land recovery and tax reduction.
    Before the closing meeting, more than five thousand peasant representatives, workers, students, and citizens participating in the meeting also held a parade in the city.

    在最后的一次会议上通过了两项决议。关于“全印农民协会和第二个五年计划”的决议赞同第二个五年计划的目标，并且认为必须有农民运动的积极参与，这些计划才能得到发展。决议特别提到最近访问过中国的粮食和农业部秘书塔帕尔关于中国人民热情地执行他们的五年计划的报告。“全印农民协会认为，如果印度这里也彻底实现了土地改革和解放了农业中的生产力，印度也可以得到这样光辉的成就”。
    关于“农民团结”的决议提出了十二点纲领作为广泛团结的基础。决议提出了三年内禁止收回租地和减轻赋税等项要求。
    在闭幕会议之前，参加会议的五千多农民代表、工人、学生和市民还在市内举行了游行。游行队伍高举“工人和农民团结万岁”，“帝国主义者退出亚洲”、“承认埃及的主权”的标语牌。
