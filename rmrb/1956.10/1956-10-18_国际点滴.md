	International Tidbits

	A Convenient Profession
	In Lawrence, Kansas, USA, there is a man named Joseph Barmeli. He is forty-four years old this year and has consistently made theft his profession. In the past few years, he has stolen over a thousand bicycles. Recently, he told the judge in court: "Stealing cars is a very profitable business, and it's easy to come and go." He said that after paying the fine, he would continue to do this work because, in America, it is a common and very convenient profession.

	Japan's Crazy "Bees"
	Recently, a large number of "hooligans" have appeared in Japan. According to the Japanese authorities, most of them are middle school students. The male "hooligans" wear black pants, thick-soled leather shoes, and their hair covers their foreheads, giving them a villainous look. People call them "drones." The female "hooligans" dye their hair red, carry cosmetic bags, but instead of cosmetics, they carry knives and other weapons. People call them "queen bees." The "drones" often pursue the "queen bees," creating all sorts of scandals.

	Bad Movies
	Not long ago, a man in Lombardy, Italy, after watching a movie, took an axe the next day and smashed the cinema's projection equipment. Don't think he was mentally ill. He explained the motives for his actions to the police, saying that his purpose in doing so was to prevent his fellow citizens from being deceived again. From this, it can be seen that the problem lies in the films being shown in Italy today, which are so bad that they are intolerable.

    国际点滴
    方便的职业
    美国堪萨斯州劳伦斯地方，有个名叫约瑟·巴美利的人。他今年四十四岁，一贯以偷窃为业，在过去几年中，他就偷了一千多辆自行车。最近，他在法庭上对法官说：“偷车这一行，获利很大，来去都很容易”。他说：他在罚完款之后，还要继续做这种工作。因为在美国这是一种普通而又很方便容易的职业。
    日本的狂“蜂”
    最近日本国内出现了大批“阿飞”。据日当局说，他们大多是中学生。男“阿飞”身穿黑裤、厚底皮鞋，头发披在额前，一派恶棍相，人们称他们为“雄蜂”。女“阿飞”并把头发染成红色，手提化装皮包，放的不是化装品，而是小刀等等武器，人们称她们为“蜂王”。“雄蜂”经常追求“蜂王”，制造种种丑闻。
    坏电影
    不久以前，意大利伦巴第地方有一个人在看完电影后，第二天拿着斧头砍坏了电影院的放映设备。不要以为他有神经病。他向警察解释自己行为的动机说，他这样做的目的在于免得市民同胞再去上当。由此可见，问题是今天在意大利上映的，有着坏到足以使人无法容忍的影片。
