Introduction to Volume 29 of the "Collected Works of Lenin"
　　　　Ding Shouhe

　　"Collected Works of Lenin," Volume 29, includes Lenin's writings from March to August 1919. Studying and researching the works in Volume 29 can help us deeply understand how Lenin led the Soviet state's various activities during this period, especially how he formulated correct lines and policies, mobilized national forces to crush the military offensives of domestic counter-revolutionary forces supported by imperialism, defend the socialist motherland, and promote the consolidation and victory of the Soviet system.

　　The majority of the works included in this volume are Lenin's reports and speeches at various meetings. Lenin's report, speeches, and the draft documents he prepared for the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) occupy an important position and a large proportion of this volume. This congress summarized the rich experience of the Soviet state's first year of existence, formulated a new party program, adopted a resolution to strengthen the Red Army, put forward specific tasks for the struggle for socialism, and focused on discussing the attitude towards the middle peasants. Based on Lenin's report on rural work, the congress decided on a new policy of forming a firm alliance with the middle peasants and upholding the proletariat's leading role in this alliance.

　　In the "Report on Rural Work" and the "Resolution on the Attitude towards the Middle Peasants," Lenin comprehensively demonstrated the importance of consolidating the alliance with the middle peasants and the measures that must be taken. He pointed out that after the victory of the October Revolution, due to the elimination of the landlords' land ownership system, great changes had taken place in rural class relations, and the number of middle peasants had greatly increased. Therefore, the sentiments and trends of the middle peasants, who wavered between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, were of great significance to the fate of the civil war and socialist construction. The outcome of the civil war largely depended on whether the middle peasants followed the proletariat. Therefore, the proletarian state should "devise many methods that are as concrete as possible to directly benefit the middle peasants" to attract the middle peasants to its side. In view of this, Lenin proposed the policy of uniting with the middle peasants instead of neutralizing them, and determined the class line that the proletariat should firmly rely on the poor peasants, consolidate the unity with the middle peasants, and carry out the struggle against the rich peasants.

　　Lenin particularly emphasized attracting middle peasants to participate in socialist construction work. He pointed out that when the proletariat had overthrown the rule of the landlords and bourgeoisie, consolidated its political power, and started to build a new society in all aspects, the middle peasant issue took on an important position. Especially in economically backward countries like Russia, in order to transform the small-peasant economy according to socialist principles, it was necessary to correctly treat the middle peasant stratum and be good at handling this extremely complex issue. Lenin firmly opposed taking expropriation measures against the middle peasants; and pointed out that in the socialist transformation of agriculture, compulsory methods must not be used against the middle peasants. Instead, they could only be guided to gradually overcome their backwardness and conservative habits with an attitude of patient education and careful attention, try to reach agreements with them in areas related to their own interests, and give them practical help; and make concessions to them on the methods and steps of socialist transformation. Lenin believed that only by adopting a gradual transition method and adhering to the fundamental principle of farmers' voluntariness could the middle peasants be attracted to their side and "gradually and firmly transition to collective farming and large-scale socialist agriculture."

　　The policy of uniting with the middle peasants and the class line in the countryside proposed by Lenin were of great significance for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and played a great role in the Soviet regime's victory over the offensives of domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary forces and in building socialism.

　　In the struggle against armed interventionists and White Guards, the Soviet working class fully developed the initiative and enthusiasm to increase labor productivity, and initiated and organized the great communist volunteer labor on Saturdays. In the article "A Great Beginning," Lenin highly praised this action of the working class, believing that the high labor enthusiasm shown by the working masses in "Communist Saturdays" was the beginning of establishing new labor attitudes and labor discipline. From this new thing, he profoundly analyzed the most important issues in socialist construction, namely, improving labor organization, launching labor competition, and increasing labor productivity. He pointed out that after the victory of the proletarian revolution, the primary task was to break the resistance of the bourgeoisie, suppress counter-revolutionary forces, and consolidate the Soviet regime; at the same time, it was inevitable to put forward the more important, more complex, and more difficult task of building socialism, creating new economic relations, and establishing new labor discipline and labor organization. The solution to this task could not be achieved by temporary courage, but required the most persistent, most tenacious, and most rare heroism shown in daily work.

　　The reason why "Communist Saturdays" had great historical significance was because it showed the working class's heroic and pioneering spirit in consciously and voluntarily increasing labor productivity and creating socialist economic and living conditions in extremely difficult circumstances. Lenin wrote: "Communism is higher labor productivity – compared with that achieved under capitalism – on the part of voluntary, class-conscious, and united workers employing advanced techniques." "Ordinary workers have risen to overcome great difficulties, risking everything to try to increase labor productivity, to try to protect every pood of grain, coal, iron, and other products, which products do not belong to the workers themselves or their 'close relatives,' but to their 'distant relatives,' that is, to the whole society, to the hundreds of millions of people who initially united into a socialist state and then united into the Union of Soviet Republics – this is the beginning of communism."

　　Lenin believed that in order to solve the most fundamental task of increasing labor productivity in the transition to communism, in addition to carrying out long-term work to educate workers and improve their cultural level, we should also rapidly, widely, and comprehensively utilize the scientific and technological experts left to us by capitalism, who usually have a bourgeois worldview and habits.

　　Lenin talked about the issue of utilizing intellectuals and experts in the "Draft Program of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," in "The Achievements and Difficulties of Soviet Power," in the "Report on the Party Program" at the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), in the "Report on the Foreign and Domestic Policies of the Council of People's Commissars" at the Petrograd Soviet Meeting, and in some other speeches. He pointed out that the Soviet regime meant the extensive unity of the working people, and the use of this united strength to destroy capitalism; but merely destroying capitalism was not enough, it was also necessary to acquire all the culture left behind by capitalism and use it to build socialism. It was necessary to acquire all scientific, technological, and artistic knowledge, because without these, it would not be possible to build a new socialist life. And science, technology, and art were in the hands of intellectuals, in the hands of experts, in their minds. Therefore, it was necessary to be good at uniting and utilizing intellectuals and experts, giving them better working and living conditions, and enthusiastically helping them politically, so that they could work hand in hand with communists and the masses as comrades in a common labor. It was necessary to patiently enlighten people with scientific literacy, making them realize that it was extremely despicable to use science to make individuals rich and to exploit people, and that the most noble task was to enable the entire working masses to understand and master scientific knowledge.

　　At the same time, Lenin also taught that although these intellectuals and experts were trained in bourgeois society, they were inevitably more or less influenced and corroded by the old society. However, as long as correct policies were adopted towards them, and when they saw that the Communist Party not only valued science and culture, but also helped promote scientific and cultural work among the masses, attracting more and more masses to participate in this cause, they would change their attitude towards us, sever their political ties with the bourgeoisie, and naturally participate in the cause of socialist construction.

　　After the victory of the October Revolution, the world's bourgeoisie was extremely hostile to the Soviet state, using every means to slander the Soviet system, saying that it destroyed democracy, freedom, and equality; the leaders of the Second International and some domestic intellectuals also repeated the rhetoric of so-called pure democracy, which was actually bourgeois democracy, saying that the dictatorship of the proletariat violated democratic principles. Lenin resolutely smashed these shameless slanders and fabrications. In the "Basic Tasks of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat in Russia" in the Draft Program of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), "What is Soviet Power," "On Deceiving the People with Slogans of Freedom and Equality," and "Speech at the First All-Russian Congress of Educational Workers and Socialist Cultural Workers," and other works, he profoundly analyzed the essential difference between proletarian democracy and bourgeois democracy, and further clarified the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

　　Lenin pointed out that in class society, democracy, freedom, and equality were by no means rights enjoyed by all members of society; the essence of all countries in the world was the dictatorship of a class, a machine by which one class oppresses another. In the countries of the landlords and bourgeoisie, a minority rules the majority, and the exploiters rule the working people; while the Soviet state is where the majority rules the minority, and the working people rule the exploiters. Bourgeois democracy is a progress compared to the Middle Ages, but it is always narrow, incomplete, and hypocritical to the core. Bourgeois democracy is the democracy of a very small number of people; it is a paradise for the rich and a deception and trap for the poor. Only proletarian democracy is the real democracy enjoyed by the broad working people.

　　Bourgeois states claim that they practice universal, national, general, and supra-class democracy, which is actually a lie to deceive the people and cover up the capitalist wage slavery system. As long as private ownership of land and other means of production still exists, even the most democratic republic is bound to be a bourgeois dictatorship. The so-called most democratic constitutions promulgated by bourgeois states in Western Europe and the Americas are merely to "consolidate the private ownership of land and capital, that is, to ensure the exploitation of the working people of their own countries and hundreds of millions of colonial people in Asia and Africa by a few 'civilized' capitalists."

　　So-called pure democracy is simply impossible; any democracy belongs to a certain class and has its class content. Lenin said it well that if democratic freedom conflicts with labor's emancipation from the oppression of capital, if it does not obey the interests of the workers freeing themselves from the exploitation of capitalists, then it is a deceptive thing. Bourgeois democracy once solemnly declared that all citizens are equal and protects everyone's property, but in fact it protects the exploiters from the encroachment of the increasingly impoverished and bankrupt masses of proletarians who have nothing but their hands. Lenin said that as long as private ownership exists and as long as exploiting classes exist, there will never be any real democracy. Therefore, the proletariat must eliminate the system of exploitation and eliminate classes in order to obtain real democracy, freedom, and equality. And the Soviet state, after destroying the system of exploitation, for the first time handed over political power to the working people, "not only giving them 'rights,' but also enabling them to actually enjoy everything seized from the bourgeoisie."

　　The Soviet regime is a truly people's regime. Lenin said that the essence of this regime is that in the past, the rich and capitalists always managed the country, but now the class that is most oppressed and has the largest number, the workers and laboring peasants, manage the country. Only workers and other laboring people are the masters of the country. Of course, Lenin also pointed out: "We clearly know that there are still many shortcomings in our Soviet power organs. Soviet power is not a panacea. It cannot cure the ills of the past at once" and cannot eliminate the poison of the old society at once. But "it enables the oppressed to stand up and gradually master the management of the entire country, economy, and production." Therefore, Lenin instructed all state organs and their staff to maintain close ties with the people, raise the masses' awareness and cultural level, widely absorb workers and peasants to participate in the management of the country, resolutely carry out the struggle against bureaucracy, and eliminate the bad habits of coercion and commandism.

　　Lenin thoroughly exposed the mask of the United States, which advertised itself as a democracy. He pointed out that the American bourgeoisie tried its best to boast that it was the most democratic and free country in order to deceive the people. However, neither the American bourgeoisie or government, nor any other bourgeoisie or government in the world, could or dared to compete with the Soviet government on the basis of the principles of true freedom, equality, and democracy. For example: "To conclude a treaty guaranteeing our government and any other government the free exchange of... pamphlets published in any language in the name of the government, containing the original text of the laws of the country and the original text of the constitution, with an explanation of the superiority of the constitution. No bourgeois government in the world dares to conclude such a treaty of peace, civilization, freedom, equality, and democracy with us." This completely exposed the hypocrisy of the American so-called freedom and democracy, and showed that only the proletarian Soviet state was the most democratic country and the only country that truly loved freedom, equality, and peace.

　　In addition, this volume also includes famous essays and speeches such as "The Third International and Its Place in History," "The Tasks of the Third International," and "On the State."

    “列宁全集”第二十九卷介绍
    丁守和
    “列宁全集”第二十九卷包括列宁在1919年
  3月至8月这一期间的著作。学习和研究二十九卷的著作，可以帮助我们深刻地了解列宁在这一时期如何领导苏维埃国家的各方面活动，特别是如何制定正确的路线和政策，动员全国力量来粉碎在帝国主义支持下的国内反革命势力的军事进攻，保卫社会主义祖国，促进苏维埃制度的巩固和胜利。
    收入本卷的大部分著作是列宁在各种会议上的报告和演讲。列宁在俄共（布）第八次代表大会上的报告、发言和他所起草的大会文件，在本卷占有重要的地位和很大的篇幅。这次代表大会总结了苏维埃国家诞生一年多来的丰富经验，制定了新的党纲，通过了加强红军的决议，提出了为社会主义而斗争的具体任务，并着重地讨论了对中农的态度问题。大会根据列宁关于农村工作的报告，决定了同中农实行坚固联盟并坚持无产阶级在这个联盟中的领导作用的新政策。
    列宁在“关于农村工作的报告”和“关于对中农的态度的决议”中，全面地论证了巩固地联合中农的重要性以及必须采取的措施。他指出，在十月革命胜利后，由于消灭了地主的土地所有制，农村阶级关系发生了重大变化，中农的人数大大增加了，因而，动摇于无产阶级和资产阶级之间的中农的情绪和动向，就对于国内战争和社会主义建设的命运有很重要的意义。国内战争的结局在很大程度上要依中农是否跟无产阶级走为转移。因此，无产阶级的国家应当“想出许多尽量具体的、使中农直接得到一些好处的办法”，把中农吸引到自己方面来。有鉴于此，列宁提出了用联合中农代替中立中农的政策，确定了无产阶级要坚决依靠贫农，巩固地团结中农，并进行反富农的斗争的阶级路线。
    列宁特别重视吸引中农参加社会主义建设工作。他指出当无产阶级已推翻地主资产阶级的统治、巩固了自己的政权并从各方面着手建立新社会的时候，中农问题就提到了重要的地位。尤其在像俄国这样经济落后的国家，要以社会主义原则改造小农经济，就必须正确地对待中农阶层，善于处理这个极复杂的问题。列宁坚决反对对中农采取剥夺手段；并指出在农业的社会主义改造中，决不能对中农采用强迫命令的手段。而只能用耐心教育和细心关注的态度，引导他们逐步克服其落后性和保守习惯，在有关他们切身利益的地方，设法同他们达成协定，给以实际的帮助；在社会主义改造的方法和步骤上，要向他们让步。列宁认为，只有采取逐步过渡的方法，坚持农民自愿这一根本原则，才能把中农吸引到自己方面来，“逐步而坚定地过渡到共耕制和大规模的社会主义农业”。
    列宁所提出的团结中农的政策和农村的阶级路线，对于巩固工农联盟具有极大的意义，对于苏维埃政权战胜国内外反革命势力的进攻和建成社会主义起了极大的作用。
    在反对武装干涉者和白卫分子的斗争中，苏联工人阶级充分地发挥了提高劳动生产率的主动性和积极性，发起和组织了伟大的共产主义星期六义务劳动。列宁在“伟大的创举”一文中很高地评价了工人阶级的这一行动，认为工人群众在“共产主义星期六义务劳动”中所表现的高度劳动热情，是树立新的劳动态度和劳动纪律的开端。他从这个新事物中，深刻地分析了社会主义建设中最重要的问题，即改善劳动组织，展开劳动竞赛，提高劳动生产率的问题。他指出，无产阶级革命胜利后，首要的任务是打破资产阶级的反抗，镇压反革命势力，巩固苏维埃政权；同时不可避免地要提出建设社会主义，创造新的经济关系，建立新的劳动纪律和劳动组织这一更重要、更复杂、更困难的任务。这个任务的解决，绝不能靠一时表现出来的勇气，而需要在日常工作中表现出来的最持久、最顽强、最难得的英勇精神。
    “共产主义星期六义务劳动”所以具有巨大的历史意义，就是因为它表明了工人阶级在极端困难的情况下自觉自愿地提高劳动生产率，创立社会主义经济条件和生活条件的英勇、首创精神。列宁写道：“共产主义就是利用先进技术的、自愿自觉的、联合起来的工人所创造出来的较资本主义更高的劳动生产率。”“普通工人起来克服极大的困难，奋不顾身地设法提高劳动生产率，设法保护每一普特粮食、煤、铁及其他产品，这些产品不归劳动者本人及其‘近亲’所有，而归他们的‘远亲’即归全社会所有，归起初联合为一个社会主义国家然后联合为苏维埃共和国联盟的千百万人所有，——这也就是共产主义的开始。”
    列宁认为，要解决提高劳动生产率这一过渡到共产主义的最根本的任务，除了进行长期的工作来教育工人和提高他们的文化水平外，还应该迅速地、广泛地和全面地利用资本主义遗留给我们的、通常是具有资产阶级的世界观和习惯的科学技术专家。
    列宁在“俄共（布）党纲草案”中，在“苏维埃政权的成就和困难”、在俄共（布）第八次代表大会上“关于党纲的报告”和在彼得格勒苏维埃会议上“关于人民委员会对外对内政策的报告”及其他一些讲演中，都谈到利用知识分子和专家的问题。他指出，苏维埃政权意味着劳动者广泛的团结起来，并以这种团结的力量去摧毁资本主义；但仅仅摧毁资本主义还不行，还需要取得资本主义遗留下来的全部文化，用它来建设社会主义。必须取得全部科学、技术和艺术知识，因为没有这些，就不能建设社会的新生活。而科学、技术和艺术却在知识分子手中，在专家手中，在他们的脑子里。因此，必须善于团结和利用知识分子和专家，给他们以较好的工作和生活条件，并在政治上热情地帮助他们，使他们同共产党员和群众手携手地同志般地从事共同劳动。要耐心地启发有科学素养的人，使他们意识到把科学用来使个人发财，使人剥削人是极其卑鄙的，意识到使全体劳动群众了解和掌握科学知识是最崇高的任务。
    同时，列宁还教导说，虽然这些知识分子和专家是在资产阶级社会培养出来的，都避免不了或多或少地受到旧社会的影响和浸蚀，但是，只要对他们采取正确的政策，当他们看到共产党不仅重视科学文化，而且在群众中帮助推行科学文化工作，吸引愈来愈多的群众参加这种事业时，他们就会改变对我们的态度，在政治上同资产阶级割断关系，并自然而然地参加到社会主义建设事业中来。
    在十月革命胜利后，全世界资产阶级极端仇视苏维埃国家，用尽一切手段污蔑苏维埃制度，说它破坏民主、自由和平等；第二国际的首领们及国内一部分知识分子也重复着所谓纯粹民主而实际是资产阶级民主的论调，说无产阶级专政违反民主原则。列宁坚决粉碎了这些无耻的诽谤和谰言。他在俄共（布）党纲草案的“俄国无产阶级专政的基本任务”、“什么是苏维埃政权”、“关于用自由平等的口号欺骗人民”和“在全俄教育工作者和社会主义文化工作者第一次代表大会上的演说”等著作中，深刻地分析了无产阶级民主与资产阶级民主的本质区别，进一步阐明了无产阶级专政的理论。
    列宁指出，在阶级社会里，民主、自由和平等，绝不是全体社会成员都能享有的权利；世界上一切国家的实质都是阶级的专政，是一个阶级压迫另一个阶级的机器。在地主资产阶级的国家里，是少数人统治多数人，剥削者统治劳动人民；而苏维埃国家则是多数人统治少数人，劳动人民统治剥削者。资产阶级民主与中世纪比起来是一个进步，但它始终是狭隘的、残缺不全的和虚伪透顶的。资产阶级民主是极少数人的民主，它对富人是天堂，对穷人是骗局和圈套。只有无产阶级民主才是供广大劳动人民享受的真正民主。
    资产阶级国家标榜它们实行的是全民的、全民族的、普遍的、超阶级的民主，这实际上是欺骗人民，掩饰资本主义雇佣奴隶制度的谎话。只要土地及其他生产资料私有制仍然存在，即使最民主的共和国都必然是资产阶级专政。西欧和美洲资产阶级国家颁布的所谓最民主的宪法，也不过是为了“巩固土地和资本的私有制，即保障少数‘文明的’资本家对本国劳动者和亚非等地几亿殖民地人民的压榨”。
    所谓纯粹的民主是根本不可能有的，任何民主都是属于一定的阶级而有其阶级内容的。列宁说得好，民主自由如果同劳动摆脱资本压迫相抵触，如果不服从劳动者摆脱资本家剥削的利益，那就是骗人的东西。资产阶级民主曾庄严地宣布一切公民平等，对人人的财产加以保护，其实这是保护剥削者不受日益贫穷破产而变成除双手以外一无所有的无产者大众的侵犯。列宁说道，只要私有制存在，只要剥削阶级存在，就决不会有什么真正的民主。因此，无产阶级必须消灭剥削制度、消灭阶级，才能获得真正的民主、自由和平等。而苏维埃国家正是在摧毁了剥削制度后，第一次把政权交给了劳动人民，“不仅给他们‘权利’，而且使他们能实际享有从资产阶级那儿夺来的一切”。
    苏维埃政权是真正人民的政权。列宁说，这个政权的实质就是：从前管理国家的总是富人和资本家，而现在管理国家的则是遭受压迫而且人数最多的阶级——工人和劳动农民。只有工人和其他劳动人民才是国家的主人。当然，列宁也曾指出：“我们清楚地知道，在我们苏维埃政权机构中还有不少的缺点。苏维埃政权并不是神丹妙药。它不能一下子治好过去的毛病”，不能一下子清除旧社会的遗毒。但是“它使受压迫的人能够站立起来，能够逐渐掌握对整个国家、经济和生产的管理。”因此，列宁指示所有国家机关及其工作人员必须密切与人民群众的联系，提高群众的觉悟和文化水平，广泛地吸收工人和农民参加国家的管理，坚决进行反对官僚主义的斗争，清除强迫命令的恶习。
    列宁彻底揭穿了以民主相标榜的美国的假面具。他指出，美国资产阶级竭力吹嘘他们是最民主自由的国家，以此欺骗人民，但是，不论是美国资产阶级或政府，不论是世界上其他任何资产阶级或政府，都不能也不敢根据真正自由、平等和民主的原则同苏维埃政府竞赛，比如说：“订立一种条约，保证我国政府和其他任何政府自由交换……以政府名义用任何一种文字出版、刊有本国法律原文和宪法原文并附有宪法优越性的说明的小册子。世界上任何一个资产阶级政府都不敢同我们订立这样一个和平、文明、自由、平等、民主的条约。”这就完全暴露了美国所谓自由民主的虚伪性，说明只有无产阶级的苏维埃国家才是最民主的国家，才是真正爱好自由平等和和平的国家。
    此外，本卷还包括了“第三国际及其在历史上的地位”、“论第三国际的任务”及“论国家”等著名的论文和讲演。
