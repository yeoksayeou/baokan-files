The Tangier Question

To enter the Atlantic Ocean from the Mediterranean Sea, one must pass through two famous seaports: Gibraltar in Europe and Tangier, known as the "Gibraltar of Africa." The nine-nation conference currently being held in Fedala, Morocco, is to discuss the future of Tangier.

Situated at the western entrance of the Strait of Gibraltar, Tangier is currently an international zone, jointly administered by eight countries: France, the United Kingdom, the United States, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands. It is also one of the world's major financial currency exchange centers.

Tangier covers an area of 583 square kilometers and has a population of 110,000, mainly composed of Berbers, Arabs, and Jews. However, in recent years, the European population has also increased to 40,000 or 50,000.

Tangier originally belonged to Morocco but was occupied by the Romans, Vandals, and Arabs. After the 15th century, it was successively occupied by Portugal and England. In 1684, Morocco recovered this land. From then until 1906, Tangier was always an inseparable part of Morocco.

As the world entered the 20th century, Morocco became the target of aggression by imperialist countries. Large areas of its land were occupied by France, while another part was occupied by Spain. Imperialist countries engaged in fierce contention for Tangier, which has important strategic value, and were unable to reach a consensus. Thus, in 1906, the Treaty of Algeciras was signed in Algeciras, Spain, stipulating that Tangier should be separated from Morocco and become an international seaport jointly administered by Britain, France, and Spain. This was, in effect, a colonial rule by imperialism over this piece of Moroccan land.

Despite the fact that Britain, France, and Spain had placed Tangier under their joint colonial rule, various imperialist countries continued to fiercely contend for this place due to the importance of Tangier's status. From 1918 to 1919, France attempted to abolish the Treaty of Algeciras and incorporate Tangier into French Morocco, but this failed due to opposition from other countries. In 1928, Italy demanded to obtain the same status as Britain in Tangier, and thus Tangier became jointly administered by Britain, France, Italy, and Spain. In 1940, Spain took the opportunity of France being defeated by Germany and other relevant countries being preoccupied by the war to exclusively occupy Tangier.

The Paris Treaty after the end of World War II stipulated that Tangier would continue to be an international zone, thereby ending Spain's exclusive occupation. In 1952, the United States, Britain, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, and Italy held a meeting and decided to form a "Tangier International Management Committee" composed of diplomatic representatives from the eight countries, and decided that Spain would serve as the commander of the Tangier "special police." Currently, the ruling power of Tangier is actually in the hands of the French and Spanish Residents-General in Morocco.

In sharp contrast to the attitude of Western colonial countries, the Soviet Union has never been willing to harm the interests of the Moroccan nation. Tsarist Russia was one of the signatories of the Treaty of Algeciras, and after the Second World War, the Soviet Union was also invited to participate in the International Management Committee, but the Soviet Union consistently refused to participate. Recently, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement expressing the hope that Tangier would be incorporated into Morocco and that the so-called international co-management system of Tangier, which harms the rights of the Moroccan people, should be abolished.

Now that Morocco has recently gained independence, it has every right to reclaim Tangier. The Sultan of Morocco has made it clear that Morocco enjoys "unrestricted and full" sovereignty over Tangier. The conference being held in Fedala, Morocco, should fully satisfy this legitimate demand of Morocco. (Xu Ba)

### 丹吉尔问题

    丹吉尔问题
    从地中海进入大西洋需要经过两个著名的海港，这就是欧洲的直布罗陀和被称为“非洲的直布罗陀”的丹吉尔。目前正在摩洛哥的菲达拉举行的九国会议就是要讨论丹吉尔的前途问题。
    处于直布罗陀海峡西部进口的丹吉尔，目前是一个国际共管区，由法国、英国、美国、西班牙、葡萄牙、意大利、比利时和荷兰等八国共同管理。同时它也是世界主要金融货币交换中心之一。
    丹吉尔的面积共有五百八十三平方公里，人口共十一万，其中主要有柏柏尔人、阿拉伯人和犹太人。但是近年来，欧洲人也增加到四、五万人了。
    丹吉尔原来属于摩洛哥，但是曾经被罗马人、汪达尔人、阿拉伯人占领过。十五世纪以后，又被葡萄牙和英国相继占领过。在1684年，摩洛哥收复了这块土地。自此以后，直到1906年，丹吉尔始终是摩洛哥的不可分割的一部分。
    当世界进入二十世纪的时候，摩洛哥成为各帝国主义国家侵略的对象。它的大片土地被法国侵占了，另一部分土地则被西班牙所侵占。帝国主义国家对于具有重要战略价值的丹吉尔展开了激烈的争夺，并相持不下。这样就在1906年，在西班牙的阿尔几西拉斯签订了一个条约，其中规定：丹吉尔脱离摩洛哥而成为由英国、法国和西班牙共管的国际海港。这实际上是帝国主义对摩洛哥的这一块土地的一种殖民统治。
    尽管英、法、西三国已将丹吉尔置于他们共同的殖民统治之下，但是由于丹吉尔地位的重要性，各帝国主义国家对于这块地方仍然进行着激烈的争夺。1918年到1919年、法国就想废除阿尔几西拉斯条约而把丹吉尔合并于法属摩洛哥，由于各国的反对而未能实现。1928年，意大利要求取得和英国在丹吉尔的相同地位，于是丹吉尔就由英、法、意、西四国共管。1940年，西班牙趁法国被德国击败而其他有关国家也被大战所牵制的时机，独占了丹吉尔。
    第二次世界大战结束后的巴黎条约规定：丹吉尔继续为国际共管区，从而中止了西班牙的独占。1952年，美、英、法、西、荷、比、葡、意八国开会决定由八国外交代表组成“丹吉尔国际管理委员会”，并决定由西班牙担任丹吉尔“特别警察”指挥。目前，丹吉尔的统治权实际上掌握在法、西两国驻摩洛哥总督的手里。
    同西方殖民国家的态度形成鲜明对照的是：苏联从来不愿意损害摩洛哥民族的利益。沙皇俄国曾经是阿尔几西拉斯条约的签订国之一，而在第二次大战后，苏联也曾被邀请参加国际管理委员会，可是苏联始终拒绝参加。最近苏联外交部发表声明：希望丹吉尔归并摩洛哥，并且取消损害摩洛哥人民权利的所谓国际共管丹吉尔的制度。
    既然摩洛哥已在最近获得独立，它就完全有权利收回丹吉尔。摩洛哥苏丹已经明白表示：摩洛哥对丹吉尔享有“不受限制的和全部的”主权。正在摩洛哥菲达拉举行的会议应该充分满足摩洛哥的这个正当要求。　（徐拔）
