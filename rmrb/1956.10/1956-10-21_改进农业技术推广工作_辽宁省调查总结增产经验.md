Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 18th: The Liaoning Provincial Department of Agriculture organized more than 130 agricultural work cadres and agricultural science and technology personnel in mid-October to go to rural areas in 29 cities and counties to summarize experiences in increasing production and technical reform.

This year, thanks to the promotion of production technology reforms by farmers in Liaoning Province on the basis of collectivization, coupled with favorable weather, both grain and cotton have achieved bumper harvests. This year, the province's total grain output is estimated to reach 8 million tons, an increase of 30% over last year; the total cotton output will double that of last year; and the total soybean output will increase by 200,000 tons compared to the highest-yielding year of 1954. The focus of this investigation and summary work is to conscientiously summarize the experiences of various regions in increasing production and promoting technological reforms, in preparation for future promotion.

In order to overcome the past subjective and generalized work styles in promoting technical reforms, this investigation and summary work particularly emphasized being realistic, paying attention to regional characteristics, and also summarizing the lessons of failures.

    改进农业技术推广工作
    辽宁省调查总结增产经验
    新华社沈阳18日电　辽宁省农业厅在10月中旬组织了一百三十多名农业工作干部和农业科学技术人员，分别到二十九个市、县的农村总结增产经验和技术改革的经验。
    今年由于辽宁省农民在合作化基础上推广了生产技术改革，加上风雨调和，所以粮棉都获得了大丰收。今年全省粮食总产量估计可以达到八百万吨，将比去年增产三成；棉花总产量将比去年增产一倍；大豆总产量比产量最高的1954年还要增加二十万吨。这次调查总结工作的中心，就是要把各地增产经验和推广技术改革的经验认真地总结起来，准备今后推广。
    为了克服过去在推广技术改革中的主观主义和一般化的工作作风，这次调查总结工作特别强调要实事求是，要注意地区特点，同时也要总结失败的教训。
