    The Dark Side of American Elections
    By American Writer Kennedy

    The American presidential and congressional elections are about to be held this year. In these days, the United States is filled with flowery propaganda about American-style "democracy" and "freedom"; however, anyone who seriously examines American elections can expose this lie. Elections under the "democracy" of the dollar are by no means free. The people's right to vote is often deprived.
            Restrictions on Voting
    Due to the endless restrictions on voting faced by the American people, the proportion of voters has been declining sharply for half a century. Now, the number of people who actually vote is only half of the potential voters in the United States.

    The various restrictions that cause the number of voters to decrease range from illegal means to terrorist activities. However, their purpose is to serve the interests of the oligarchy and the interests of the political machines that operate through intrigue.

    In recent years, several states in the United States have implemented an ambiguous "educational" test for voters, allowing registrars to arbitrarily reduce the voter list to include only a minimum number of selected voters. This destroys the lists of qualified voters in batches.

    The names of tens of thousands of Black voters have been collectively cleared and erased from the list. For example, in Monroe, Louisiana, this May, the names of 4,000 Black people were erased. In Montgomery (where the bus boycott took place), 3,500 Black people applied for registration, but less than 250 were approved.

    The registration period is often only a few weeks. And applicants may encounter registrars "out fishing" during this period. Black applicants sometimes have to queue for a whole day and answer meaningless questions such as "How many windows are there in the courthouse?" Many registrars are white women. Their offices are located in their own homes, and Black people dare not enter. Some registrars carry a trained dog that specializes in biting Black people.

    In some southern states, there is also a progressive poll tax with a maximum of $30. Not only can Black people not afford this tax, but it also affects more white people.

    The conservative Gallup poll admits that in the last national election, "the total number of people in the eleven southern states who did not vote due to poll taxes and other local reasons" was 7.7 million.

    The "other local reasons" mentioned very politely in the Gallup poll include the bloodiest terrorist activities. In many areas, the price of a Black vote is still: "One vote, one life."

    Recently, a Black doctor in Mississippi, ignoring the threats of intimidators, said: "As long as I live to election day, I will go to vote." He did not live to election day. He was shot and killed by a sniper with a shotgun, his face blown apart.

    Not long ago, when an election was held in Greene, Georgia, Isaac Nixon asked the election officials: "Do I have the right to vote?"

    They told him: "You have the right to vote. But we advise you not to exercise this right."

    Nixon voted. That night, he was shot and killed at his home by the election officials.

    In recent years, many people have paid with their lives for voting, including the Moores of Florida, who were bombed to death while sleeping, and Marlar of Georgia, who was shot by a group of 30 robed men (translator's note: robes are the robes of the Ku Klux Klan, ordinary members wear white robes, and terrorist members wear black robes) while taking his family to church.

    In addition to various forms of lynching, in 1956, there was also an "economic sanction" that prevented Black people who voted from obtaining land, housing, jobs, and loans.

    As the election approaches, terrorist activities have reached a climax. Effigies were hung on lampposts, with a sign on the effigies: "This is a Black person who voted." Notices were posted on the doors of Black churches: "The first Black person to vote will be killed without mercy." Black people received letters with bullets attached, saying: "Tomorrow, you better continue working and not go anywhere else." On the eve of the election, the Ku Klux Klan held parades, set up car snake formations between towns, and burned fiery crosses on the lawn in front of the courthouse. On election day, Black people woke up to find a small coffin placed on the doorstep of their house, with the Ku Klux Klan emblem on it.
            Stealing Votes
    In the land of dollar "democracy," the methods by which vote bandits steal votes and plunder elections are not well known.

    According to the "Fair Election Promotion Association," at least one million votes were stolen in the last national election.

    This civilian association said: "Election fraud is increasing. Throughout the United States—whether in large cities, small towns, or politically fanatical villages—there is some form of election fraud. Whether it is a national election, a local school board election, a judge's election, or a vote on highway matters, fraud may occur."

    Steele, an experienced investigator hired by the U.S. Congressional Committee that investigates "irregularities" in elections, said: "If the elections were conducted according to the law, then about fifty or so people holding high state and city positions would not have obtained their positions." So-called "irregularities" are merely a polite way of saying vote stealing.

    Those who commit the crime of vote stealing are rarely tried or punished. This is because prosecutors and defendants are often bound by common political machines and economic interests. Two years ago, a prosecutor in Felix, Alabama, stood up to investigate vote-stealing incidents. As a result, he was assassinated.

    In recent years, the few judgments that have been made include the following examples involving the 1954 election: In January, the head of an election station in Chicago and five other personnel were sentenced to three to five years in prison for fraud. The day before the verdict in that case, a chief poll watcher in Cincinnati was fined $500 for stealing votes. He was not sent to prison because he was 77 years old. In North Carolina, 59 people were prosecuted.

    Vote stealing and election plundering is a huge enterprise in the United States, and there are many methods. Here are some examples:

    1.  Deception: If a ballot does not comply with the regulations of electing only one candidate for one office and marking an "X," the ballot will be invalidated. Cunning vote counters take advantage of this. They hide a small piece of pencil lead under their fingernails or under their rings, and then secretly add some "X" marks to many of the opponent's ballots according to their needs, invalidating these ballots until their side obtains enough votes to guarantee victory.

    2.  Slow Counting: Cunning vote counters deliberately count votes slowly. After the radio broadcasts the situation in all other polling stations, they suddenly become busy, increasing the votes for their side, or trying to invalidate the votes for the other side as much as possible, until they can plunder the election results.

    3.  Ghost Voters: Pittsburgh District Attorney Malone recently warned: "Many qualified voter lists contain the names of people who have died or moved elsewhere." In every American election, countless votes are cast using the names of people who have been dead for many years. Due to laziness or collusion in cheating, registrars have not made their qualified voter lists public. Vote stealers take great advantage of this opportunity.

    4.  Multiple Voters: Vote stealers are not satisfied with impersonating the dead and departed. They also hire hooligans to use various aliases and strange false addresses—possibly empty fields, office buildings, bathhouses, cemeteries—to register to vote. These "multiple voters" can get about $10 for each vote. New York Attorney General Goldstein said: "Someone is doing everything possible to put together and stuff the registration list on a scale that has not been seen in twenty years."

    5.  Voting by List: A few minutes before the polling station closes, cunning managers quickly flip through the registration list, and then impersonate the names of people who have not yet arrived to vote directly. Citizens who arrive at the last minute find that someone has voted in their name. If they want to protest, they may be threatened with arrest for attempting to vote again. There is rarely an investigation into this situation. However, last year, a newspaper in Providence, Rhode Island, checked the list of registered citizens who had voted and found that many people had not even approached the polling station.

    6.  Managerial "Assistance": The law allows managers to assist illiterate or physically disabled people in voting. Many people are a little timid when they see the formidable voting recorders, so they let the managers "help"—they don't know that the result of this help is often to vote for candidates they don't want to vote for.

    7.  Fixed Voting Recorders: The use of voting recorders is becoming increasingly widespread in the United States. Initially, its application made it difficult to steal votes. However, soon cheaters discovered that as long as a match, a hairpin, or a paper clip was inserted into the lower end of the lever with the candidate's name on the voting recorder, that lever could not record. Another cunning trick is carried out by cunning managers. As long as the manager gently pulls the curtain surrounding the voting recorder, if a gap appears in the curtain, even a small one, the votes cast by people voting inside the curtain cannot be recorded on the recorder. (Translator's note: The curtain is an important part of the voting recorder. The activation and counting of the voting recorder is carried out with the closing and opening of the curtain.) Sometimes, the clock at the polling station is moved, so cunning managers can open the door early and rush to cast some fraudulent votes before the opposing supervisors arrive. Sometimes, the names of the candidates on the voting recorder lever are switched, so that an unpopular candidate gets all the votes of a popular candidate. Finally, if the opposing supervisor is not vigilant, the cunning vote counter can read one hundred and thirty-nine votes for Candidate A as one hundred and thirty-nine votes for Candidate B when reading the number of votes, and the final total number of votes checked will still be consistent with the total number recorded on the voting recorder.

    8.  Recounting: When the election is unfavorable to the officials in office, they often demand a recount. This recount "miraculously" (through destroying ballots and miscalculations) reverses the election situation and restores their positions.

    9.  Black Briefcases: In the November election, the number of absentee votes is estimated to reach seven million, of which only a quarter will be cast by Americans living abroad. Officials in office take out so-called "black briefcases" filled with absentee ballots several days after the election. Absentee ballots can often reverse the election situation. Cunning politicians pay those who leave the city where they live on election day and are willing to hand over their ballots for mailing, with rewards of up to $50. In some places, debtors and tenants are pressured by creditors and employers to hand over their ballots and "leave the town" on election day. In some places, the election results are often determined by black briefcases. For example, in the recent election in Clay County, North Carolina, a total of 3,349 votes were cast, of which 1,076 were overdue and brought in by black briefcases.

    What has been said above is only part of the dark side of American elections. American monopoly groups and southern plantation owners use the two-party machinery and propaganda machinery to manipulate elections, which has put a layer of insurmountable curtain on the American election system, so that the American people cannot truly exercise their democratic rights. The advanced elements of the American people are working hard to expose the election tricks under this curtain manipulated by American monopoly groups and southern plantation owners, and are fighting to win and protect the people's real right to vote.

    美国选举的黑幕
    美国作家　肯尼迪
    今年的美国的总统和议会选举就要举行了。在这些日子里，在美国充满了关于美国式的“民主”“自由”的花言巧语的宣传；但是任何人只要认真考察一下美国的选举，就可以揭穿这种谎言。在美元“民主”下的选举，决不是自由的。人民的选举权利往往要被剥夺。
            限制投票
    由于美国人民在投票方面遭受到层出不穷的限制，事实上，半世纪以来，投票人的比例一直在急剧地下降。现在，实际投票的人仅及美国潜在的投票人的半数。
    造成选民数目降低的各种限制，从非法的手段直到恐怖活动，种类繁多。不过，它们的目的都是为寡头政治的利益，为纵横捭阖的政治机器的利益而服务。
    最近几年，美国若干州实施了一种对选民的暧昧的“教育”测验，容许登记员任意把选民名单缩减到只包括最少数的、挑选出来的投票人。这样就毁掉了成批的合格投票人的名单。
    上万黑人投票人的姓名，被集体清除，自名单上抹掉。例如今年5月在路易斯安那州门罗市，就有四千名黑人的姓名被抹掉。在蒙哥马利城（公共汽车抵制事件发生的地方），三千五百名黑人申请登记，获准的不到二百五十名。
    登记期限往往只有数周。而申请登记者在这个期限内，还会碰上登记员“外出钓鱼”。黑人申请登记者有时需要列队等候一整天，并且要答复“法院里有多少窗子？”这一类毫无意义的问题。许多登记员是由白种妇女来充当的。她们的办公室就设在自己的住宅里，黑人不敢进去。还有一些登记员携带着一头受过训练、专咬黑人的恶狗。
    在南方若干州里，还通行着一种最高额为美金三十元的累进的人头税（投票税）。这种税收不但黑人付不起，并且使更多的白人也受了影响。
    保守的盖洛普民意测验承认，在最近一次全国选举中“南方十一州，由于投票税与其他地方性的原因，未能参加投票的人，其总数”为七百七十万。
    盖洛普民意测验里很客气地提及的“其他地方性的原因”，其中包括有最血腥的恐怖活动。在许多地区，黑人选票的代价仍然是：“一张票，一条命。”
    最近，密士失比州一位黑人医生，不顾恐吓者的威胁说：“只要我活到选举日，我就要去投票。”他没有活到选举日。他遭遇到猎枪的狙击，面部炸裂而死。
    不久以前，佐治亚州格林市举行选举时，伊萨克·尼克森向经办选举的人员问道：“我有投票的权利吗？”
    他们告诉他说：“你有投票的权利。不过我们劝告你不要去行使这个权利。”
    尼克森投了票。当天晚上，他就在自己的家里被经办选举的人所枪杀。
    近年以来，因投票而付出了生命的人很多，其中有佛罗里达州的穆尔夫妇，他们是在睡眠的时候被炸死的，又有佐治亚州的马拉尔，他是在携带家人前往教堂的途中，遭受一群三十名穿袍子（译注：袍子是三K党人的礼服，普通党人穿白袍，恐怖队员穿黑袍）的人发排枪打死的。
    除了各种形式的私刑以外，1956年还盛行着一种“经济制裁”，使投票的黑人得不到土地、房屋、工作与贷款。
    在选举临近的日子，恐怖活动达到了最高潮。路灯杆上挂起了假人，假人身上佩着一个招贴：“这是一个投票的黑人。”黑人教堂的大门上贴着“第一名投票的黑人格杀无赦”的通告。黑人收到附有手枪子弹的信件，信里说：“明天你最好继续工作，不要到其他的地方去。”选举的前夕，三K党人举行游行，在市镇间设置汽车长蛇阵，又在法院前的草地上燃烧火十字架。选举日，黑人早上起来，发现他们的门前石阶上放着一个小型的棺材，棺材上有三K党的标记。
            盗窃选票
    在美元“民主”的国度里，选票匪徒们盗窃选票、掠夺选举的方法，并不是尽人皆知的。
    据“公正选举促进协会”的估计，上次全国选举里，至少有一百万张选票被人盗窃。
    这个由平民组成的协会说：“选举中的欺骗日益增多。在美国各处——无论是大城市、小市镇或是政治狂热的乡村里——都有某种选举的欺骗行为。无论是全国选举、地方学校校董会的选举、法官的选举、公路事宜的投票，都可能有欺骗的情事。”
    调查选举中“不合规则的行为”的美国国会委员会聘请的、经验丰富的调查员斯蒂尔说：“如果选举是按照法律来进行的，那么大约有五十来名占有州、市高级职位的人物是得不到他们的职位的。”所谓“不合规则的行为”不过是盗窃选票的客气的说法。
    犯有盗窃选票罪的人，很少受到审判或被处刑。这是由于起诉者与被告往往受到共同的政治机器和经济利益的约束。两年以前，亚拉巴马州费里克斯市一位检察官挺身而出，进行有关盗窃选票事件的调查。结果，他被暗杀了。
    近几年以来，为数不多的判决里，有以下几件牵涉到1954年选举的事例：1月，芝加哥城一个选举站的负责人与五名其他的人员，由于欺诈被判处了三年至五年不等的徒刑。该案判决的前一日，辛辛那提城有一位首席监选官，由于盗窃选票被判罚款美金五百元。他因为年已七十七岁，没有被送入监狱。在北卡罗来纳州，被起诉的达五十九人。
    盗窃选票、掠夺选举在美国是一个巨大的事业，它的方法很多。以下是一些实例：
    1．诡骗　如果一张选票，不符合一个公职只可选举一个候选人、划一个×号的规定，那张选票就要作废。诡计多端的计票人对这一点加以利用。他们在自己的指甲缝或是戒指底下暗藏一小节铅笔心，然后按自己的需要秘密地在许多对方的选票上加一些×号，使这些选票归于无效，直到自己一方获得足够保证胜利的票数，方始罢休。
    2．缓慢的计算　狡猾的计票人在计算票数的时候，故意动作缓慢。等到无线电播出了所有其他各地投票站的情况以后，他们就突然地忙碌起来，增加自己一方的选票，再不然就尽量使对方的选票作废，直到自己能够把选举结果掠夺过去。
    3．鬼魂投票者　匹兹堡城地方检察官马隆纳最近警告说：“许多合格投票者的名册，都载有一些亡故的或是迁徙他处的人的姓名。”每一届美国选举，无数的选票都是用死去多年的人的姓名来投的。由于疏懒或串通作弊，登记员没有使他们的合格投票人名册得到公布。选票盗窃者大大地利用了这个机会。
    4．投重票的人　选票盗窃者并不满足于冒名顶替死者及离去的人。他们还雇用了一些流氓无赖使用着形形色色的化名、无奇不有的虚假地址——可能是空场、办公大楼、蒸汽浴室、公墓——去进行投票登记。这种“投重票的人”每投一票，可得美金十元左右的报酬。纽约的检察长戈尔德斯特因说：“有人正在竭尽全力拼凑、填塞登记名册，其规模之大为二十年以来所罕见。”
    5．按名册投票　投票站停闭前数分钟，诡计多端的管理人，迅速翻阅一下登记名册，然后冒用尚未到场的人的姓名，径行投票。最后一分钟到场的公民，发现有人用他的姓名投了票。如果他要提出抗议，就可能遭受因企图再次投票而被逮捕的威胁。对于这种情况很少进行调查。不过，去年罗得岛州普洛费顿斯城一家报馆，查对了一下登记名册上所载投过了票的公民，结果发现许多人连投票站都没有走近。
    6．管理人的“帮助”　法律允许管理人协助文盲或是身体残废的人进行投票。许多人看见了状甚可畏的投票记录器，不免有些胆怯，就让管理人来“帮助”——他们不知道这种帮忙的结果，往往是把票投给了他们所不愿意投的候选人。
    7．固定式投票记录器　投票记录器的使用在美国日益推广。最初，它的应用曾经使盗窃选票的事不易进行。可是，不久欺诈者就发现只要把一根火柴、一根发针或是一个纸夹插入投票记录器上有候选人姓名的杠杆的下端，那根杠杆就不能进行记录了。另外一个狡猾的手段是由诡计多端的管理人来执行的。只要管理人轻轻地扯动围绕着投票记录器的幕幔，如果幕幔现出一道缝隙、哪怕是一道很小的缝，在幕幔里投票的人所投的票就无法在记录器上记录出来。（译注：幕幔是投票记录器的重要部分。投票记录器的启用与计票是随着幕幔的关闭与开启而进行的。）有时，投票站的钟被拨动过了，狡猾的管理人因此可以提早开门，趁反对方面的监视人尚未到场，抢先投入一些欺诈的选票。有时，投票记录器杠杆上候选人的姓名被掉换过，使一个不受欢迎的候选人得到了受人拥戴的候选人所有的选票。最后，如果反对方面监视人的警惕性不高，狡猾的计票人在宣读票数的时候，可以把甲候选人的一百三十九票读成是乙候选人的一百三十九票，而最后总票数的检算结果与投票记录器上所记录的总数仍旧会是相符合的。
    8．重算　当选举的进行对在职的官员们不利时，他们往往要求重新计算选票。这种重算就“不可思议地”（凭借着毁灭选票与误算）扭转选举形势，恢复他们的职位。
    9．黑色小皮包　在11月的大选里，通讯投票的票数估计将达七百万张，其中由侨居国外的美国人来投的将仅占四分之一。在职的官员们在选举后数日，拿出装满了缺席者选票的、所谓的“黑色小皮包”来，缺席者的选票往往能够扭转选举的形势。诡诈的政客以最高达美金五十元之多的报酬，付给那些在选举日离开所居住的城市、并且愿意交出选票付邮的人。有些地方，负债者与佃农受着债主与雇主的压力，交出选票并且在选举日那天“离开本市镇”。也有一些地方，选举结果往往是由黑色小皮包来决定的。例如北卡罗来纳州克雷市最近一次的选举，共投票三千三百四十九张，其中一千零七十六张是逾期由小黑皮包带来的。
    上面所说的，不过是美国选举黑幕的一部分。美国垄断集团和南方的庄园主，利用两党机器和宣传机器来操纵选举，更是在美国选举制度上盖上了一层难以超越的帷幕，使美国人民不能真正行使他们的民主权利。美国人民中的先进分子，正在努力揭破美国垄断集团和南方庄园主所操纵的这种帷幕下的选举戏法，并为争取和保障人民的真正的选举权利而斗争。
