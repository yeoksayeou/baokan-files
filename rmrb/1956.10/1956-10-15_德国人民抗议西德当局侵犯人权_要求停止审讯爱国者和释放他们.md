Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 14th: According to TASS, the West German Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe began trying eight German patriots on October 8th, six of whom are citizens of the German Democratic Republic. They were all arrested by West German police last summer for demanding the organization of an all-German delegation to present the German people's opinions on reunification to the Four Power summit. This illegal trial immediately aroused widespread protests from the German people.

    Dahlmann, Chairman of the Legal Committee of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, wrote to the Chairman of the Legal Committee of the West German Federal Assembly, demanding that the Legal Committee of the Federal Assembly take steps to protect human rights and stop the trial, which aims to undermine all-German understanding.

    The Suhl District Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany demanded the immediate release of the German patriots.

    Recently, a mass rally of working people was held in Berlin, demanding the release of the illegally arrested patriots. More than 10,000 residents of Oschatz sent letters and telegrams demanding an end to the trial. Mass rallies protesting the persecution of German patriots were also held in cities such as Riesa and Finsterwalde.

    德国人民抗议西德当局侵犯人权
    要求停止审讯爱国者和释放他们
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社柏林讯：在卡尔斯卢厄的西德联邦宪法法院10月8日开始审讯八个德国爱国者，其中六个是德意志民主共和国的公民。他们都是由于在去年夏天要求组织全德代表团向四大国首脑会议陈述德国人民对重新统一的意见而被西德警察逮捕的。这种非法审讯立刻激起了德国人民的广泛抗议。
    德意志民主共和国人民议院法律委员会主席达尔曼写信给西德联邦议院法律委员会主席，要求联邦议院法律委员会采取步骤来保护人权，制止这个目的在于破坏全德谅解的审讯。
    民主德国全国阵线苏尔区委员会要求立刻释放德国爱国者。
    最近在柏林举行了劳动人民群众大会，会上要求释放被非法逮捕的爱国者。欧法特市有一万多居民写信和打电报要求停止审讯。在里萨、芬斯特瓦尔德等城市也举行了抗议迫害德国爱国者的群众大会。
