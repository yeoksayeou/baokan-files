    Too Many Links in Hog Acquisition
    In Jilin Province, a pig goes through four links from purchase to sale, with twenty-four different kinds of fees. In Sanchahe, Fuyu County, 360 li away from Changchun, buying a second-grade pig weighing 175 jin costs 27 cents per jin, or 47.68 yuan per head. However, from the farmer's home to the district purchasing station, an additional 1.07 yuan is added for feed, 1.40 yuan for herding, and 2.62 yuan for loss. From the district purchasing station to the county food company, another 12.043 yuan is added for broker fees, storage fees, transportation fees, loading fees, escort fees, return trip fees, interest, loss, operating expenses, and pure profit. When the county food company collects the pigs and sends them to the Changchun Food Company, additional costs are added for feed, slaughter fees, slaughter tax, "small feet" fees (likely a slang term for minor expenses), and taxes and profits. When the Changchun Municipal Food Company distributes the pork to retail stores, more fees are added. After adding all these fees, the price per pig becomes 88.30 yuan, which is 85% higher than the original purchase price.
    A 175-jin pig can produce just over 113 jin of meat. Based on a retail price of 68 cents per jin of meat, plus the sale of pig offal, each pig can only sell for about 87 yuan, which is only equivalent to about 98.5% of the total acquisition cost and expenses.
    Clearly, there are too many links in the acquisition of live pigs, and the expenses in the circulation process are also high, which is not good for producers, consumers, or the state. It is hoped that the commercial departments will study and improve this situation.　　　Wang Mingen

### 收购生猪的流转环节太多了

    收购生猪的流转环节太多了
    在吉林省，一头猪从买到卖要经过四道环节，加上二十四种不同的费用。在离长春三百六十里的扶余县三岔河购买一头重一百七十五斤的二等猪，收购价格是每斤二角七分多钱，每头是四十七元六角八分。但是，这头猪从农民家里送到区的收购站，就要加一元零七分的饲料费，一元四角的赶猪费，二元六角二分的损耗。由区收购站送往县食品公司的过程中，又要加经纪员费、保管费、运费、装车费、押运费、回空费、利息、损耗、经营费以及纯利共十二元零四分三。县食品公司把猪集中起来，送往长春食品公司时，又要加饲料费，屠宰费、屠宰税、小脚费等费用、税收和利润。长春市食品公司把猪肉分到零售店，还要加一些费用。这些费用加上以后，每头猪价已经变成了八十八元三角，比原采购的价格高出85％。
    一百七十五斤重的猪，能出一百十三斤多肉，按每斤肉零售价六角八分和猪下水的售价，每头猪只能卖八十七元左右，约只相当于收购价和费用开支总数的98.5％。
    显然，收购生猪的流转环节太多了，流转过程中的费用开支也就大了，这对生产者、消费者和国家都是没有好处的。希望商业部门研究并改进这种现象。　　　王明恩
