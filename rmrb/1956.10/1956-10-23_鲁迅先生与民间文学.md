Mr. Lu Xun and Folk Literature
Zhao Jingshen

V. The Class Character of Folk Literature

Mr. Lu Xun was remarkably capable of analyzing folk literature works from a class perspective. He could keenly use a class viewpoint to distinguish the essence and dross of folk literature works. That is to say, he could clearly see what were the good things, and what were the bad or even counterfeit things.

Take the well-known story of "The Legend of the White Snake" as an example. Mr. Lu Xun believed that the depiction of the White Snake's "courage never to yield" was very good, but "repaying private favors and flooding Jinshan Temple for her own sake" was not good. The White Snake's unwavering courage in fighting with Fahai should be good. As for flooding Jinshan Temple, "Fahai should indeed be responsible," as he forced the White Snake to take this action. However, she only flooded Jinshan Temple and did not harm living beings elsewhere. Current local operas, which begin with the love between the White Snake and Xu Xian, no longer touch upon repaying favors. Thanks to Mr. Lu Xun's guidance, modern Peking Opera and various local operas can mostly distinguish the essence and dross of this story.

Similarly, Mr. Lu Xun was able to delve into the essence from the surface phenomena to distinguish the true from the false in proverbs, folk songs, and jokes.

A proverb says: "Each person sweeps the snow from his own doorstep, and doesn't care about the frost on his neighbor's roof." Mr. Lu Xun believed that this proverb "is a motto of the oppressed, teaching people to be dutiful, pay taxes, contribute donations, be law-abiding, not to be negligent, not to be dissatisfied, and especially not to meddle in other people's affairs; while the oppressors are not included." "Proverbs certainly seem to be the crystallization of the meaning of a time and a nation, but in fact, they are only the meaning of a portion of the people." ("Random Thoughts from North and South": "Proverbs")

A folk song says: "People come to call my soul, I call myself to bear it. If calling others doesn't work, bury myself under a stone tomb." This was a folk song of some "ignorant people" in Nanjing in 1928. It is said that "Premier's tomb is nearing completion, and stonemasons are collecting the souls of young children to seal the dragon's mouth." This folk song shows the selfishness of the "ignorant people" of Nanjing, who only want to escape disaster themselves, "vividly" expressing their indifference "to the feelings of revolutionaries." Although this is a folk song of the "ignorant people" themselves, the reason why the "ignorant people" are "ignorant" should be regarded as the "achievements" of the past ruling class. Therefore, this folk song and similar songs should not be regarded as the people's own meaning.

A joke says: "It was noon on a hot day, and a peasant woman was working hard when she suddenly sighed: 'The Empress must be so happy. She must still be sleeping at this time, and when she wakes up, she calls out: Eunuch, bring me a persimmon cake!'" This mocks the villagers for not having seen the world, thinking that persimmon cakes are the most precious thing, and that the villagers' vision is very shallow. But Mr. Lu Xun believed that "this is not 'lower-class Chinese talk,' but 'lower-class Chinese talk' in the minds of the higher-class Chinese, so it is actually higher-class Chinese talk. Among the lower-class Chinese themselves, they may not have said this at that time, and even if they did say it, they would not have thought it was a joke."

Lenin's wife said: "We are now enthusiastic about folk literature—the creation of the people, which is good. However, we must be very careful about everything that pretends to be literature and is fabricated." Mr. Lu Xun practiced what Lenin's wife said.

VI. The Application of Folk Literature Works

Mr. Lu Xun had collected many works of folk literature, and he loved folk literature very much in his childhood, so why didn't he have any full-length papers on folk literature? ("The Illiterate Writer" is only a section of "Random Talks Outside the Gate," and "On the Fall of Lei Feng Pagoda" is not entirely about folk literature.) Some people believe that this is because he was unwilling to work with "gentlemen." Although this seems quite plausible, if Mr. Lu Xun really wanted to do it, couldn't he have created his own path? Why did he have to mix with people he didn't want to associate with? Moreover, didn't Mr. Lu Xun also publish a letter in "Folklore Weekly"? Mr. Lu Xun purchased Gui Zhuang's "Song of Eternal Sorrow" in 1926, and perhaps shortly before that, he published that letter discussing this ballad in Folklore Weekly. My view is that Mr. Lu Xun valued the legacy of folk literature, but his surrounding environment was too suffocating and too dark, requiring him to fight. Therefore, the research work of folk literature was not as important as the combat work. He also never made major revisions to "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction" after it was written for this reason. He felt that it was more necessary and urgent to apply folk literature to combat than to study folk literature.

Mr. Lu Xun applied folk literature very flexibly. For example, Mr. Lu Xun opposed warmongers and even took the positive deity Xing Tian as an example to conceive for the reactionary rulers: "If there were no heads, but they could still be used as mechanical devices for service and war, how obvious the situation in the world would be. At this time, there is no need to use hats and medals to show the rich and the poor. Just look at whether there is a head or not to know the distinction between master and slave, officials and people, superiors and inferiors, nobles and the lowly. And there will be no more troubles such as revolution, republic, and meetings." He believed that "Xing Tian" in the Classic of Mountains and Seas "is really worthy of being regarded as a teacher. If our people can be like this, how safe and happy the rich would be?" Unfortunately, "he 'grasps his shield and axe and dances,' which seems to indicate that he is unwilling to be content even in death, and he is different from my ideal good citizens who are specially designed to facilitate the rich. Tao Qian also has a poem: 'Xing Tian dances with shield and axe, his fierce will remains constant,' even this seemingly detached old recluse said so, which shows that even without a head, there will still be a fierce will, and the world of the rich will probably be difficult to have peace for a while." ("Grave": "Casual Talk at the End of Spring")

Sometimes Mr. Lu Xun thought more deeply than folk literature. For example, the joke about the magistrate's birthday originally only said that the magistrate was born in the year of the rat, and the subordinates sent golden rats. The magistrate then said that his wife's birthday next year would be in the year of the ox. Mr. Lu Xun then went a step further and said: "I am afraid his concubine will also be born in the year of the elephant. The elephant is not in the twelve zodiac animals… This is a method I came up with for him." ("Hua Gai Collection": "This and That") Another example is the folk song satirizing that government troops are fiercer than bandits: "Bandits come like combing, soldiers come like combing closely, officials come like shaving." Mr. Lu Xun then went a step further and said: the greed of government troops "not only shaves off the hair, but also scrapes off the flesh and muscles, which can never be filled." ("Random Thoughts from North and South": "Talking about Jin Shengtan") I think these three examples are enough. This is how Mr. Lu Xun used sharp and profound folk literature to grasp the enemy's weaknesses and stab them even more deeply, making it impossible for the enemy to dodge. He used these folk literature works to expose the brutality and shamelessness of the reactionaries. Mr. Lu Xun's greatness lies in this. He is not only a researcher of folk literature, but also uses folk literature as a weapon to wage an uncompromising struggle against the enemy. (End of full text)

    鲁迅先生与民间文学
    赵景深
    五　民间文学的阶级性
    鲁迅先生能够卓越地用阶级观点来分析民间文学作品。他能敏锐地用阶级观点来辨别民间文学作品的精华和糟粕。也就是说，他能很清楚地看出哪些是好东西，哪些是不好的甚至是冒充的东西。
    就拿我们所熟知的“白蛇传”故事来说吧。鲁迅先生认为表现白娘娘“百折不回之勇气”的地方就很好，但是“报私恩及为自己而水漫金山”就不好。白娘娘与法海斗争到底，那种百折不回的勇气应该是好的。至于水漫金山，“的确应该由法海负责”，是法海逼得白娘娘走此一着的。可是她也只是水漫金山，并不曾漫到别的地方去残害生灵。现在的地方戏，开端写白娘娘与许仙的恋爱，也都不再触到报恩了。由于鲁迅先生的指示，现在的京剧和各种地方戏，大都能辨别这故事的精华和糟粕。
    其他像谚语、歌谣和笑话，鲁迅先生也都能够从表面的现象深入到本质去辨别真伪。
    谚语云：“各人自扫门前雪，莫管他家瓦上霜”。鲁迅先生认为这谚语“乃是被压迫者们的格言，教人要奉公，纳税，输捐，安分，不可怠慢，不可不平，尤其是不要管闲事；而压迫者是不算在内的。”“谚语固然好像一时代一国民的意思的结晶，但其实，却不过是一部分的人们的意思。”（“南腔北调集”：“谚语”）
    歌谣云：“人来叫我魂，自叫自当承。叫人叫不着，自己顶石坟”。这是南京一部分“愚民”在1928年的歌谣。据说“总理墓行将工竣，石匠有摄收幼童灵魂，以合龙口之举”。这首歌谣显示了南京“愚民”的自私，只想自己脱离灾难，“淋漓尽致”地表现了他们“对于革命者的感情”的淡漠。这虽是“愚民”自己的歌谣，“愚民”之所以“愚”，却应该看作过去统治阶级的“治绩”，因此，这首歌谣和类似这首的歌谣都不应该看作人民自己的意思。
    笑话云：“是大热天的正午，一个农妇做事做得正苦，忽而叹道：‘皇后娘娘真不知道多么快活。这时还不是在床上睡午觉，醒过来的时候，就叫道：太监，拿个柿饼来！’”这是嘲笑乡下人没有见过世面，认为柿饼是最珍贵的东西，乡下人的眼光非常浅陋。但鲁迅先生认为“这并不是‘下等华人话’，倒是高等华人意中的‘下等华人话’，所以其实是高等华人话。在下等华人自己，那时也许未必这么说，即使这么说，也并不以为笑话的。”
    列宁夫人说：“我们现在热中于民间文学——人民的创作，这是好的。不过要非常慎重地对待一切冒充文学伪造的东西。”列宁夫人的话，鲁迅先生是实行了的。六　民间文学作品的应用
    鲁迅先生既是搜购了不少民间文学的著作，童年对于民间文学又很爱好，为什么没有整篇的有关民间文学的论文呢？（“不识字的作家”只是“门外文谈”里的一节，“论雷峰塔的倒掉”也不是全篇谈民间文学的）有人认为这是由于他不愿与“正人君子们”在一起搞。这虽然似乎想得颇为近情，可是，如果鲁迅先生真的要搞，难道不能另树一帜么？何必一定要与他所不愿为伍的人混在一起呢？况且，鲁迅先生在“歌谣周刊”上，不是也发表过一封信么？鲁迅先生曾在1926年购买过归庄的“万古愁曲”，也许在那时以前不久，他就在歌谣周刊上发表那封谈这篇鼓词的信了。我的看法是，鲁迅先生对于民间文学的遗产是重视的，不过他的周围环境太窒闷，太黑暗，需要他战斗，因此民间文学的研究工作就不及战斗工作更为重要。他对于“中国小说史略”以后一直不曾大加修订，也是为此。他觉得与其研究民间文学，还不如把民间文学作品应用在战斗上，更为需要急迫。
    鲁迅先生应用民间文学非常灵活。例如，鲁迅先生反对好战的人们，竟借积极的神刑天为例来替反动的统治者设想云：“假使没有了头颅，却还能做服役和战争的机械，世上的情形就何等地醒目呵，这时再不必用什么制帽勋章来表明阔人和窄人了，只要一看头之有无，便知道主奴，官民，上下，贵贱的区别。并且也不至于再闹什么革命，共和，会议等等的乱子了。”他认为山海经上的“刑天”“实在是很值得奉为师法的。假使我们的国民都能这样，阔人又何等安全快乐？”可惜的是，“他又‘执干戚而舞’，则似乎还是死也不肯安分，和我那专为阔人图便利而设的理想底好国民又不同。陶潜先生又有诗道：‘刑天舞干戚，猛志固常在’，连这位貌似旷达的老隐士也这么说，可见无头也会仍有猛志，阔人的天下一时总怕难得太平的了”。（“坟”：“春末闲谈”）
    有时鲁迅先生想得比民间文学更深入一层。例如讲知县寿辰的笑话，本来只说知县属鼠，属员们送金鼠，知县便说他的太太明年生日，是属牛的。鲁迅先生便深入一层地说：“怕他的姨太太也会属象。象不在十二生肖之内，……这是我替他设想的法子。”（“华葢集”：“这个与那个”）又如讽刺官军猛于盗贼的民谣是：“贼来如梳，兵来如篦，官来如剃”。鲁迅先生又深入一层地说：官军之贪，“不但剃尽毛发，就是刮尽筋肉，永远填不满的。”（“南腔北调集”：“谈金圣叹”）我想，举这三个例就够了。鲁迅先生就是这样运用尖锐而深刻的民间文学，抓住了敌人的要害，更深地击刺，使得敌人无从躲闪的。他利用这些民间文学作品，来揭露反动派的残暴和无耻。鲁迅先生的伟大就在这个地方。他不只是一个民间文学的研究者，而是应用民间文学这武器向敌人作永不妥协的斗争的。　（全文完）
