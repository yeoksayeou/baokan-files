    President Sukarno Visits the Palace Museum
    (Our report) President Sukarno and his entourage, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi, visited the Palace Museum yesterday morning. The distinguished guests from Indonesia were warmly welcomed there by thousands of visitors.
    President Sukarno, who obtained a degree in engineering from Bandung Institute of Technology thirty years ago, showed great interest in the magnificent architecture of this ancient palace. He carefully observed the overall design of the three main halls: the structure and building materials used for the palace gates, window lattices, eaves, brackets, steps, railings, and so on. He said: We should study how to build the most solid and beautiful buildings in the most economical way.
    Wu Zhongchao, Director of the Palace Museum, presented five volumes of "Song Dynasty Paintings" to President Sukarno. The President was very happy and said, "They enrich my collection of paintings."
    In the exhibition hall, the President discovered that the cultures of China and Indonesia have many similarities. Strolling through the court of the ancient Chinese emperors, he said that he was reminded of the Kingdom of Java. Seeing an antique "Qianlong Light Brown Satin with Brocade Flowers," he said that in Palembang, South Sumatra, there is also this kind of brocade, but it is red. Pointing to a ruby Guanyin vase, he said to Vice Premier Chen Yi: He also has Chinese porcelain from the Qianlong period in his presidential palace in Jakarta.

    苏加诺总统参观故宫
    本报讯　苏加诺总统和他的随行人员，昨天上午由陈毅副总理陪同，参观了故宫博物院。来自印度尼西亚的贵宾们在那里受到了成千上万名参观者的热情欢迎。
    三十年前在万隆工学院获得了工学士学位的苏加诺总统，对于这座古老宫殿式的宏伟建筑，感到浓厚兴趣。他仔细地观赏了三大殿的整体设计：宫门、窗棂、飞檐、斗拱、阶石、栏杆等等的结构和所用的建筑材料。他说：应当研究怎样用最经济的方法，来建造最坚固、美观的建筑。
    故宫博物院院长吴仲超把五卷“宋人画册”赠给苏加诺总统。总统非常高兴，说：“它们丰富了我的藏画”。
    总统在陈列室里，发现了中国和印度尼西亚两国的文化，有着许多相似之处。漫步在中国古代帝王的宫庭，他说他想起了爪哇王国，看见一匹古色古香的“乾隆香色缎地花锦”，他说，在苏门答腊岛南部的巨港，也有这种锦绣，不过是红色的。他指着一座红宝石观音瓶向陈毅副总理说：在雅加达他的总统府里，也搜藏有乾隆年间的中国瓷器。
