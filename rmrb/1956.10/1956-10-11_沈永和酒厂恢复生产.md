    Shen Yonghe Distillery Resumes Production

    (Our Dispatch) The Shaoxing Shen Yonghe Distillery, which ceased operations seventeen years ago, is resuming operations and will further expand production.

    The Shen Yonghe Distillery was founded in the third year of the Kangxi reign in the Qing Dynasty, and has a history of 292 years. The wine produced by this factory has always been famous for its high quality and delicious taste among Shaoxing wines. The famous Shaoxing wines known at home and abroad, such as Shan Niang, Zhuangyuanhong, and Xiangxue, began to be brewed at the end of the Qing Dynasty. In the past, the wine produced by this factory was not only sold well in major cities in China, but also exported to Singapore, the Nanyang Islands, Japan, and Poland. These famous wines won first prizes and gold medals at the Nanyang Industrial Exposition in 1911, the Panama Pacific International Exposition in the United States, and the West Lake Exposition in 1925. Until Shaoxing fell to the Japanese invaders in 1939, the factory was looted by the Japanese invaders and stopped brewing and closed down.

    After the National Famous Wine Quality Conference, in order to restore the reputation of Shaoxing wine, the Shaoxing Municipal Industrial Food Company merged all its affiliated wineries into the joint state-private Shen Yonghe Distillery; and decided to expand it on the banks of the famous Jian Lake (the water of Jian Lake is clear, and the water quality is moderately fertile, and the brewed wine is thick and mellow). The Shaoxing Municipal Food Industry Company also transferred Lu Nianqi, an old technician who had brewed wine at the Shen Yonghe Distillery for more than 50 years, and his four assistants from other places. It is preliminarily decided to trial-produce two hundred vats of wine this winter. It is estimated that after the Shen Yonghe Distillery is fully put into production in November this year, the quantity of various famous wines produced will be nearly ten times higher than before the Anti-Japanese War.

    沈永和酒厂恢复生产
    本报讯　歇业十七年的绍兴沈永和酒厂，正在恢复经营并进将一步扩大生产。
    沈永和酒厂创建于清朝康熙三年，到现在已经有二百九十二年的历史。这个厂出产的酒在绍兴老酒中一向是以质高、味美而出名的。名闻海外的善酿、状元红、香雪等绍兴名酒在前清末年就开始酿制。过去这个厂出产的酒，不仅畅销国内各大城市，而且远销新加坡、南洋群岛、日本和波兰等地。这些名酒在1911年南洋第一次劝业会、美国巴拿马赛会和1925年西湖博览会上，曾经获得一等奖和金质奖牌。直到1939年绍兴沦陷时，这个厂因受日寇抢掠而停酿闭歇。
    在全国名酒质量会议以后，为了恢复绍兴酒的声誉，绍兴市工业食品公司把所属酒厂全部合并为公私合营沈永和酒厂；并且决定在著名的鉴湖畔加以扩建（鉴湖的水清彻，水质肥瘠适中，酿出来的酒质厚而味醇）。绍兴市食品工业公司还把曾在沈永和酒厂酿过五十多年酒的老技师鲁念七和他的四个助手从外地调来。今年冬季初步决定先试制二百缸酒。预计沈永和酒厂在今年11月全部投入生产以后，生产的各种名酒的数量将比抗日战争前提高近十倍。　（姚峙夏）
