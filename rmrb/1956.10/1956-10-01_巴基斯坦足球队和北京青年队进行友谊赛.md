Xinhua News Agency, 30th - The Pakistan national football team lost to the Beijing Youth Football Team with a score of 0-5 in their second, and last, friendly match in Beijing today.

Zhang Junxiu, the goalkeeper of the Beijing Youth Team, who was praised as the "impregnable Great Wall" at last year's World Youth and Student Festival, steadily caught more than a dozen balls kicked and headed from various angles by the opponent in the ninety-minute game, maintaining the Beijing Youth Team's winning advantage.

At the beginning of the game, the Pakistan team used their proficient long passes to quickly approach the goal of the Beijing Youth Team, and obtained a "corner kick" opportunity in the first minute. However, before the ball they kicked landed, it was jumped up and firmly caught in his arms by goalkeeper Zhang Junxiu.

Subsequently, the Beijing Youth Team also approached the opponent's goal, and in the fifth minute, right winger Shi Wanchun kicked in the first goal.

Although the Pakistan team lost the game, their tenacious and unremitting offensive spirit was praised by the audience.

Vice Chairman Zhu De watched this wonderful game and received the leader of the Pakistan team, Mu. Sayeed, and deputy leader A. Mirza before the game started. After the game, Vice Premier of the State Council He Long and Chen Yi also went to the stadium to shake hands with the players from both sides one by one and took a photo together.

    巴基斯坦足球队和北京青年队进行友谊赛
    据新华社30日讯　巴基斯坦国家足球队今天在来北京以后的第二场——也是最后一场友谊比赛中，以零比五败给北京青年足球队。
    曾经在去年世界青年与学生联欢节被誉为“难以攻破的万里长城”的北京青年队守门员张俊秀，今天在九十分钟的比赛中十几次稳稳地接住了对方由各种角度踢来和用头顶来的球，使北京青年队一直保持着净赢的优势。
    巴基斯坦队在比赛开始后用他们擅长的长传球，很快地逼近了北京青年队的球门，并且在第一分钟获得了发“角球”的机会。但是他们踢来的球还没落地，就被守门员张俊秀跳起来牢牢地接在怀里。
    随后，北京青年队也迫近了对方球门，在第五分钟的时候，右边锋史万春就踢进了第一个球。
    尽管巴基斯坦队输了球，他们顽强和不懈的进攻精神受到了观众的称赞。
    朱德副主席观看了这场精采的比赛，并且在比赛开始以前接见了巴基斯坦队领队穆·赛义德和副领队阿·米尔扎。在球赛结束以后，国务院副总理贺龙和陈毅还到球场上同双方队员一一握手，并且在一起照了像。
