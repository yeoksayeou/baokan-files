    Refuting the Shameless Slander and Vilification of the Chinese Government and People by the British Government
    Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, Issues Statement

    (Reported by this newspaper) Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, issued the following written statement regarding the Kowloon riots:

    The Kowloon riots were entirely created by Kuomintang secret agents. Now the evidence, both testimonial and material, is conclusive, and this is an undeniable fact. The British authorities in Hong Kong did not take precautions against this organized and planned act of violence by Kuomintang secret agents beforehand, and failed to stop it when it happened, even adopting a laissez-faire attitude, thus causing great losses to Chinese residents. This is also an inescapable responsibility. We fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's and Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu's protests to the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong. This is a just call on behalf of our 600 million Chinese people.

    What is especially infuriating is that the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong have not only refused to admit these facts to this day, but also deliberately confused the truth, vainly attempting to deceive the world and even make malicious accusations, falsely claiming that the Chinese government's protest is interfering in their internal affairs, and even fantasizing that the Chinese government is using this incident to seek political capital. This thorough and completely unfounded lie is a shameless slander and vilification of our Chinese government and all the Chinese people, which we absolutely cannot tolerate!

    We must remind the British government that the British authorities in Hong Kong's sheltering and condoning of Kuomintang secret agents using Hong Kong and Kowloon as a base for sabotage activities against mainland China has fully proven that the actions of the British authorities in Hong Kong truly constitute interference in China's internal affairs. This obviously has a harmful impact on the relations between our two countries, China and Britain, and directly threatens peace in Asia. This is not only firmly opposed by the Chinese people, but also firmly opposed by the British and peace-loving people of the world.

    The Chinese people are peace-loving, but not to be bullied. We do not interfere in the internal affairs of any country, and we will never allow others to interfere in our internal affairs. We resolutely demand that the British government must quickly change its extremely impolite and unfriendly attitude towards the Chinese people, immediately stop its actions of interfering in China's internal affairs, make a thorough, effective, and reasonable settlement of the Kowloon riots, and effectively protect the safety of life and property of Chinese residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

    驳斥英国政府对我国政府和人民的无耻诽谤和诬蔑
    民主同盟主席沈钧儒发表谈话
    本报讯　中国民主同盟主席沈钧儒就九龙暴乱事件发表书面谈话如下：
    九龙暴乱事件完全是国民党特务分子一手制造出来的，现在人证物证确凿，这是无可抵赖的事实。香港英国当局对国民党特务分子这一次有组织有计划的暴行，事前不加防范，事发不加制止，甚且采取放任的态度，因而造成中国居民的很大损失，这也是不可推卸的责任。我们完全拥护周恩来总理和章汉夫副部长对英国政府和香港英国当局所提出的抗议。这是代表我们六亿中国人所提出的正义的呼声。
    尤其令人气愤的是英国政府和香港英国当局至今不仅不肯承认这一切事实，而且有意混淆事实真象，妄想欺蒙世人耳目，甚至含血喷人，妄指中国政府的抗议是干涉他们内政，甚至异想天开地说，中国政府利用这一事件寻求政治资本。这种彻头彻尾毫无根据的谎言，完全是对我们中国政府和全体人民无耻的诽谤和诬蔑，是我们绝对不能容忍的！
    我们不能不提醒英国政府：香港英国当局包庇和纵容国民党特务分子利用港九作为对中国大陆进行破坏工作的基地的种种事实，已充分证明了香港英国当局的行为真正构成了对中国内政的干涉，这对我们中英两国关系显然起着危害性的影响，而且直接威胁着亚洲的和平，这不但是中国人民坚决反对的，英国和世界爱好和平的人民也都坚决反对。
    中国人民是爱好和平的，但是不可欺侮的，我们不干涉任何国家内政，我们也决不容许他人来干涉我们的内政，我们坚决地要求英国政府必须迅速改变对中国人民极其不礼貌、不友好的态度，立即停止干预中国内政的行为，对九龙暴乱事件必须作彻底地有效的、合理的处理，并切实保障港九中国居民的生命财产的安全。
