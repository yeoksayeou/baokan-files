    Hate Stele
    — Letters from Hanoi
    Yuan Ying
    We were returning to Hanoi from Taiyuan City, the capital of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region, along Highway 3. Logically, after more than three days of intense visits, we should have been in a relatively lighthearted mood on the return journey, especially since the scenery was so charming: in the distance, behind the coconut groves and slender betel nut trees, the setting sun dyed the western sky into a blaze of color, and gusts of cool evening breeze swept across the endless green fields. However, the reluctant farewell in Taiyuan left us feeling melancholy; and just as our mood had begun to recover slightly, we saw the Hate Stele on the banks of the Phu Lu River.
    This stele, made of cement, is only two meters high. The same words are engraved on the front and back:
          Hate Stele
      The people of Phu Lu Commune deeply
  remember in their hearts the blood debts owed to us by the
  imperialists and feudal landlords:
      Statistics
    Laboring people killed　98
    Cadres and soldiers killed　31
    Houses burned down　553
    Masses tortured　301
    Women raped　70
    We stood before the stele, gazing at it. The setting sun's afterglow shone on the Hate Stele and the old pillbox next to it, and we seemed to see the fires of Phu Lu Commune in those days; the Phu Lu River flowed south, and we seemed to hear the sobs of women and children. Yes, let us deeply remember the hatred in our hearts, and turn it into strength! The people endured in a pool of blood, and persevered in the struggle. Now, just look at the banks of this Phu Lu River: next to the bridge are the French army barracks and large pillbox, the barbed wire is already rusty, and weeds grow all around; in the fields as far as the eye can see, new thatched huts have been built on the burned ruins, new crops have grown, and cowherds ride on the backs of oxen, slowly returning home. Phu Lu Commune is still the Phu Lu Commune of the Vietnamese people.
    On the return journey, the old Vietnamese writer Nguyen Cong Hoan told us: such Hate Steles can be found in many villages in Viet Bac. If you pay a little attention, you can see them on both sides of the highway.
    In fact, no matter how precise these "statistics" on the Hate Steles are, how could they ever account for even a millionth of the crimes of the French colonialists on Vietnamese soil!
      "Every Vietnamese family has hatred for the French colonialists," Comrade Nguyen Cong Hoan said.
    Then he talked about his own family. Six members of his family died at the hands of the French colonialists: his mother, three younger brothers, a son, and a young grandson.
    As he spoke, although he tried to remain calm, he was still agitated, and his eyes were red. Our hearts also suddenly became heavier. For a long, long time, no one spoke a word.
    In the heart of every Vietnamese, there is a Hate Stele that can never be erased!

    仇恨碑
    ——河内书简
    袁鹰
    我们从越北自治区的首府太原市，沿着第三号公路回河内来。按理，经过三天多紧张的访问，归途上应该有比较轻快的心情，何况景色是如此迷人：在远方的椰子林和纤细的槟榔树背后，夕阳把西天染成一片彩霞，一望无际的绿野上飘过一阵阵清凉的晚风。可是，太原的依依惜别，使我们心神黯然；而当我们的心情稍稍平复的时候，却又看见了富路河畔的仇恨碑。
    这块用洋灰砌成的碑，不过二公尺高。正面和背面刻着同样的字句：
          仇恨碑
      富路乡的人民，深深地在
  心底记住帝国主义者和封建地
  主对我们的血债：
      统计
    被杀害的劳动人民　98人
    被杀害的干部和战士　31人
    被烧毁的房屋　553间
    被拷打的群众　301人
    被强奸的妇女　70人
    我们伫立在碑前，凝视着它。夕阳余晖，照在这仇恨碑和它旁边的旧碉堡上，我们仿佛看到当年富路乡的烈火；富路河水滚滚南流，我们仿佛听到妇孺的呜咽声。是的，把仇恨深深地记在心底，并且把它化为力量吧！人民在血泊里熬过来，把斗争坚持了下去。现在，你就看一看这富路河畔吧，桥旁有法军的军营和大碉堡，铁丝网已经生锈，四周长满了野草；在我们目力所能及的四野，在被烧毁的废墟上，新的茅舍盖起来了，新的庄稼长起来了，牧童骑在牛背上，缓缓回家。富路乡依然是越南人民的富路乡。
    归途上，越南的老作家阮公欢同志告诉我们：这样的仇恨碑，在越北的许多村庄都有，只要稍为注意一下，在公路的两旁，就可以见到它们。
    其实，这些仇恨碑上的“统计”，无论怎么精确，又哪儿抵得上法国殖民者在越南土地上的罪行的千万分之一！
      “越南每一家人家，都有对法国殖民者的仇恨。”阮公欢同志这样说。
    然后他就说他自己的家。他家里有六个人死在法国殖民者的手里：母亲、三个弟弟、一个儿子和一个小孙子。
    他说这话的时候，虽然努力使自己平静，然而还是激动的，他的眼睛也红润了。我们的心也陡然更加沉重。好久好久没有说一句话。
    在每个越南人的心底，都有一块永远不可磨灭的仇恨碑！
