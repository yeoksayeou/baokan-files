	Why Aren't Demobilized Soldiers Hired?
	Tang Xixiong, the director of the Zhouning County Tax Bureau in Fujian Province, once asked the Finance and Trade Department of the Zhouning County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to recommend a correspondent to them. One day, I called to tell him that there was a twenty-three-year-old demobilized soldier… But before I could finish, the director hung up the phone as soon as he heard the words "demobilized soldier." Later, he went to the Finance and Trade Department himself and said, "It's very inappropriate for demobilized soldiers to do correspondent work; they can't be called upon and are not easy to lead." After I questioned him, he said, "Demobilized soldiers are okay, but only if they are eighteen years old." May I ask, are there any eighteen-year-old demobilized soldiers? How much older is a twenty-three-year-old than an eighteen-year-old? Obviously, this director intentionally refused to hire demobilized soldiers. I believe that this discriminatory attitude towards demobilized soldiers should be criticized.

	Park Flowers Should Be for Everyone to See
	A park was built in the western suburbs of Datong City in 1951. Over the years, the park's management personnel have purchased flower seeds from Beijing and other places to cultivate flowers, plants, and trees. However, many of the beautiful flowers they cultivated have been taken away, pot by pot, free of charge, and placed in their own offices, dormitories, or courtyards. In the past five years, about five or six thousand pots of flowers have been taken from the park. Many of the people who come to the park to ask for flowers are responsible comrades from the city's agencies, and some even hold slips approved by the Datong Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to take flowers. We find it strange that even children know that the flowers in the park are for everyone and should be left for everyone to see, and cannot be picked casually. But why are some cadres still infringing on public interests and moving the flowers from the park to enjoy them privately?

	This Road Should Be Repaired
	The road in front of the Foreign Languages ​​Press and the Ministry of Geology and other units outside Fuchengmen, Beijing, near Baiwanzhuang, is very bad. After the rain, it is flooded, and the mud splashes when cars pass by. On sunny days, the loess is several inches thick, and dust rises when cars pass by. This road is a main road with constant traffic. It is recommended that relevant departments repair it quickly.

    为什么不录用复员军人
    福建省周宁县税务局局长唐希雄，曾要求中共周宁县委财贸部给他们介绍一个通讯员。一天，我打电话告诉他，有一个二十三岁的复员军人……，那知这位局长一听到复员军人四个字，还未等我把话讲完，就将电话挂上了。后来，他又亲自跑到财贸部说：“复员军人搞通讯员工作很不妥当，叫不动，不容易领导”。经过我提出质问，他又说：“复员军人也可以，但是，只要十八岁的”。试问，有十八岁的复员军人吗？二十三岁的人究竟比十八岁老了多少呢？显然，这位局长是有意拒绝录用复员军人，我认为，这种歧视复员军人的态度，应当受到批评。　　周杏康
    公园的花要留给大家看
    大同市西郊，在1951年筹建了一座公园。几年来，这个公园的管理人员从北京等地选购花种，培植了一些花草、树木。但是，他们培植出来的许多好花，都被人一盆盆无偿的拿去，放在自己的办公室、宿舍或庭院里。五年来，这个公园的花被人拿走了约五、六千盆，来到公园里要花的人，很多都是市内机关的负责同志，往往也有些人拿着大同市公用局批准取花的条子。我们奇怪，现在，连小孩子都知道，公园里的花是大家的，要留给大家看，不能随便攀折。可是，为什么还有些干部却要去侵犯公共利益，把公园里的花搬去独自欣赏呢？

    这条马路应该修一修
    北京阜成门外百万庄外文出版社、地质部等单位门前的一条马路很不好。雨后，积水成河，汽车驶过，泥浆四溅。晴天，黄土有几寸厚，汽车一过，灰尘四起。这条马路是一条要道，成天车马不绝，行人不断。建议有关部门赶快修理一下。
