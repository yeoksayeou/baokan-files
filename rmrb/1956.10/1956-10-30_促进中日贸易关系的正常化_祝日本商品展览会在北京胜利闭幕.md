    Promoting the Normalization of Sino-Japanese Trade Relations
    ——Congratulating the Successful Conclusion of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition in Beijing
    Lei Renmin, Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade

    I.

    The Japanese Commodity Exhibition, which opened on October 6th in our capital, Beijing, successfully concluded on October 29th.

    This exhibition is the largest commodity exhibition held by Japan abroad. More than 1,000 manufacturers participated in the exhibition, displaying more than 15,000 kinds of commodities, totaling more than 50,000 pieces. Through this exhibition, we can see that Japan's modern industry is relatively developed, and Japan's production technology is quite sophisticated in many aspects. In particular, the exquisite and delicate characteristics of Japanese products fully reflect the diligence and wisdom of the Japanese people. We can also see that Japan has many products that meet the needs of our country's construction and people's lives, and there are a wide variety of commodities that can be exchanged between China and Japan. Therefore, the holding of this exhibition is of great significance for expanding trade and economic cooperation between China and Japan, promoting technological exchanges between the two countries, and enhancing the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people. However, it should be pointed out that this exhibition also has its shortcomings. Due to the sabotage by the United States and the obstruction by the Japanese government in following the United States in implementing "embargo" measures, many Japanese products, especially those that fully represent Japan's modern industry and technological level, were unable to participate in the exhibition. As a result, this exhibition cannot comprehensively reflect the current economic landscape of Japan. This cannot but make the people of China and Japan feel very sorry.

    The Japanese Commodity Exhibition was sponsored by the Japan International Trade Promotion Association in accordance with the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. It received the universal support and sponsorship of the Japan Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade, the Japan Local Assembly Members' League for the Promotion of International Trade, the Japan-China Import and Export Association, the Japan-China Trade Association, 57 Japanese industrial and commercial groups, 59 local organizations, and people from all walks of life in Japan. On the occasion of the opening of the exhibition, congratulatory messages were also received from Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama, Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry Tanzan Ishibashi, Japanese Director-General of the Economic Planning Agency Tatsunosuke Takasaki, and many Japanese public organizations.

    Our government and people have given great care and attention to the Japanese Commodity Exhibition. In just over 20 days, the number of visitors reached more than 1.25 million. Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and other leaders of our government visited the exhibition and expressed to the Japanese person in charge of the exhibition the sincere wishes of the Chinese government and people for the Japanese Commodity Exhibition and the Japanese people. Workers, peasants, students, scientific workers, officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, staff of state organs and enterprises, industrialists and businessmen, and the broad masses of urban residents in the capital and from all over the country were greatly interested in the Japanese Commodity Exhibition. They expressed warm praise for the various exquisite products created by the Japanese people through labor and wisdom.

    All this fully demonstrates that the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people are growing stronger day by day, and that the people of China and Japan have a strong common desire to further expand friendly exchanges between the two countries, improve relations between the two countries, and develop economic cooperation and trade relations between the two countries. This desire cannot be hindered or destroyed by any external force.

    II.

    Japan is a country with a relatively developed modern industry. A large part of the large number of industrial products it produces every year needs to be sold to foreign markets. At the same time, Japan's industrial needs for major raw materials and the food necessary for the Japanese people rely to a considerable extent on imports from abroad. According to statistics published by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry in May 1956, in 1955, Japan needed to import 78.3% of its iron sand, 26.1% of its coking coal, 78.3% of its salt, 61.4% of its soybeans, 9.5% of its rice, and 100% of its rubber, cotton, bauxite, and phosphate rock. Therefore, foreign trade occupies a very important position in the Japanese national economy.

    Our country is carrying out large-scale economic construction, and every year it needs to import a large amount of machinery and equipment, industrial materials, and raw materials. We have needs for certain types of equipment and machinery, ships, steel, chemical raw materials, and chemical fertilizers produced in Japan. With the development of our country's economic construction and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the needs of the broad masses of people for daily necessities are also increasing day by day. For a country like ours with a population of 600 million, even a slight increase in social purchasing power will result in a huge increase in the quantity of commodities needed. On the other hand, commodities that Japan needs to import, such as iron sand, industrial salt, soybeans, coking coal, and rice, have been mainly or to a considerable extent supplied by our country in the past several years. In the future, with the development of our country's production, we will be able to more fully supply Japan's needs.

    These situations fully demonstrate that developing trade and economic cooperation between China and Japan is very necessary for the economic development of both countries. Only in this way can it conform to the common interests of the people of both countries. If China and Japan can truly develop trade and economic cooperation with each other according to the needs and possibilities of both sides on the basis of peaceful coexistence and the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in internal affairs, then it will be of great significance for the prosperity of the economies of the two countries, especially for the Japanese economy to move towards an independent, healthy, and truly prosperous path. It is precisely for this reason that the United States is trying every means to obstruct and sabotage. We firmly believe that with the joint efforts of the people of China and Japan and the support of the people of the world, the measures taken by the United States to artificially undermine the normal economic relations between China and Japan will be completely defeated.

    III.

    Some Japanese friends who are concerned about the development of Sino-Japanese trade raised such a question after reading the "Proposals on the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" adopted by the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China not long ago: With the development of China's socialist industrialization, with the gradual formation of a complete industrial system in China, will China's need for foreign products gradually decrease year by year? Does Sino-Japanese trade have a future? They are particularly concerned about Premier Zhou Enlai's report "Proposals on the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which pointed out that we will "strive to develop the machinery manufacturing industry, especially the manufacturing of various large-scale equipment, heavy-duty machine tools, precision machine tools, and instruments that we need and lack, and strive to increase the self-sufficiency rate of machinery and equipment to about 70% after the construction of the Second Five-Year Plan." They are worried that China's need for imported machinery will be greatly reduced in the future.

    Here, I hope that everyone will pay attention to the following facts: During the Second Five-Year Plan period, our country's investment in capital construction will increase by about one time compared with the First Five-Year Plan period. By 1962, our country's industrial production will increase by about one time compared with the original plan in 1957; agricultural production will also increase by about 35% during the same period; and people's living standards will also increase accordingly. The realization of various indicators in the proposal will further boost our country's national economy, and people's purchasing power will also be further improved. This will inevitably promote the development of our country's foreign trade. That is to say, our country will not only have more products to supply for export needs, but also the materials needed by our country for economic construction and people's livelihood will continue to increase, not only in quantity but also in variety, which will open up a bright future for the development of our country's foreign trade.

    As for the issue of our country's need for machinery in the future, according to Premier Zhou's report, the self-sufficiency rate of machinery in our country will increase by 10% during the Second Five-Year Plan period. The same report also pointed out that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, the state's investment in capital construction will increase by about one time, and the old equipment also needs to be continuously updated. We can say that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, our country's machinery production still cannot keep up with the needs of construction development, and it is still necessary to import a considerable amount of machinery from abroad. Therefore, the concerns that some Japanese friends have about this issue are obviously unfounded.

    Some people hold such a wrong view that to expand trade, it is necessary to strangle the national industries of the other country, so that they will always be in a state of economic backwardness and become a market for the sale of commodities and a source of raw materials for powerful industrial countries, in order to achieve the purpose of exploiting and extracting the people of these countries. This is an old method of colonialism, and the result can only make the economy of backward countries more and more impoverished, the purchasing power of the people lower and lower, the market smaller and smaller, and foreign trade increasingly萎缩. We believe that only by continuously expanding trade on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and the promotion of the continuous development of the economies of all countries is the correct path. The foreign trade between socialist camp countries has gradually expanded and developed on the basis of the continuous upswing of the economies of all countries. The development of our country's foreign trade in recent years has also fully proved that the realization of national industrialization and the development of the national economy will not only not lead to the shrinkage of foreign trade, but will provide reliable material conditions for the development of foreign trade. In 1955, our country's total foreign trade volume increased by 1.65 times compared with 1950, which is equivalent to 3.9 times the total foreign trade volume of our country in 1936, which is a clear example.

    IV.

    From the above situation, we can see that the development of Sino-Japanese trade has many favorable conditions and has broad prospects for development. So, what is the key to why Sino-Japanese trade has not been fully developed so far? In order to explore this issue, it is meaningful to review the development of Sino-Japanese trade in recent years.

    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Sino-Japanese trade had a considerable degree of recovery, but since 1951, due to the Japanese government's pursuit of the US "embargo" measures, the trade relations between China and Japan have been severely damaged. In 1952, the total value of our country's trade with Japan was only one-quarter of that in 1950, almost in a state of complete stagnation. Thanks to the joint efforts of our government and the people of China and Japan, the trade between the two countries began to turn around. From 1952 to the present, people's organizations of the two countries have signed three trade agreements and agreements for 30 million pounds of exports each time. The first trade agreement only realized about 5% of the agreed trade volume in one year and four months from June 1952 to October 1953; the second trade agreement realized 38.8%; the implementation of the third trade agreement has made some progress compared with the previous two, that is, from the date of entry into force of the agreement in May 1955 to the end of April 1956, about 56% has been realized, of which China's exports to Japan accounted for about 75% of the agreed amount, and Japan's exports to China only accounted for about 37% of the agreed amount, which is less than half of Japan's should be exported. The reason why the three trade agreements cannot be fully fulfilled is neither because Japan does not have commodities that can be supplied, nor because China does not need Japanese commodities, but because the Japanese government followed the United States in implementing the "embargo" measures against our country and did not issue export licenses. It is precisely for this reason that in the past year alone, our country's contracts for goods worth more than 7.8 million pounds ordered from Japan have not been fulfilled, and the goods stipulated in the contracts are precisely the goods that Japan is difficult to sell and that Japanese merchants are eager to sell. The facts are very clear that as a result of the Japanese government's pursuit of the US "embargo" measures, the Japanese side has suffered great losses, which has aroused great dissatisfaction among the Japanese people and business community. We cannot but feel very sorry for this situation.

    Many Japanese friends who participated in this exhibition and came to China for visits have expressed their wish to develop the economic and trade relations and technological cooperation between China and Japan, just like us. They pay close attention to China's Second Five-Year Plan and expressed their willingness to do more business with China during the Second Five-Year Plan period. We welcome the wishes of Japanese friends. But the problem lies in the attitude and decision-making of the Japanese government. Our country implements a planned economy. The various departments of our national economy are mutually coordinated and interconnected. If one link is missed, it will inevitably affect other links. In order to build our plan on a solid and reliable foundation, we must make timely and preliminary arrangements for the machinery and equipment and important construction materials that need to be imported during the Second Five-Year Plan period, and select the most reliable and fully guaranteed markets as targets for arrangements. We would like to see more Japanese products appear in our country's economic construction base during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

    We believe that with the increasingly easing international situation, the voices of the broad masses of people around the world demanding peaceful coexistence, the development of free exchanges between the people of all countries, and the development of international trade relations and economic cooperation will become louder and louder. The needs of the Japanese people to obtain political and economic independence and autonomy, to abolish the "embargo," and to develop normal economic and trade links between China and Japan will also become stronger and stronger. After the recent Soviet-Japanese talks reached an agreement, the Japanese people have issued a call for the rapid restoration of normal relations with China. The Chinese people sympathize with this demand of the Japanese people. Now is the time for the Japanese government to solve the problem of normalizing Sino-Japanese trade relations with a positive attitude. (Attached picture)

    促进中日贸易关系的正常化
    ——祝日本商品展览会在北京胜利闭幕
    中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席　雷任民
    一
    从10月6日起在我国首都北京举行的日本商品展览会，已经于10月29日胜利闭幕了。
    这个展览会是日本在国外举办的规模最大的一次商品展览会，参加展出的厂商有一千多户，展出的商品达一万五千多种、五万件以上。通过这个展览会，我们可以看出：日本的现代工业是比较发达的，日本的生产技术水平在许多方面也是相当精湛的，特别是日本产品所具有的精致、玲珑等特点，更充分地反映了日本人民的勤劳和智慧。我们还可以看出：日本有许多产品是适合我国建设和人民生活的需要的，中日之间可以交换的商品是很广泛的。因此，这个展览会的举行，对于扩大中日两国之间的贸易和经济合作以及促进两国间的技术交流，增进中日两国人民之间的友谊，都具有重要的意义。但是，应该指出，这次展览会还有美中不足的地方，那就是由于受到美国的破坏和日本政府追随美国执行“禁运”措施的阻挠，在这次展览会中还有许多种日本产品，尤其是那些足以代表日本的现代工业和技术水平的产品未能参加展出，以致这个展览还不能全面地反映当前日本的经济全貌。这不能不使中日两国人民感到非常遗憾。
    日本商品展览会是根据第三次中日贸易协定，由日本国际贸易促进协会主办的，它得到日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟、日本地方议员促进国际贸易联盟、日中输出入协会、中日贸易会和日本五十七个工商团体、五十九个地方组织以及日本各阶层人民群众的普遍支持和赞助。在展览会开幕之际，还接到日本首相鸠山一郎、日本通商产业相石桥湛山、日本经济审议厅长官高崎达之助以及日本许多公众团体的贺电。
    我国政府和人民对于日本商品展览会给予了极大的关怀和重视。在短短的二十多天中，参观者达一百二十五万多人。毛泽东主席、朱德副主席、刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理和我国政府的其他领导人员，都参观了展览会，并且向展览会日方负责人表达了中国政府和人民对于日本商品展览会和日本人民的真挚的祝愿。首都的和来自我国各地的工人、农民、学生、科学工作者、中国人民解放军的军官和士兵、国家机关和企业的工作人员、工商业者以及广大的市民群众，对于日本商品展览会怀有极大兴趣，他们对于日本人民以劳动和智慧创造的各种精美的产品，都表示热烈的赞赏。
    这一切，充分说明了中日两国人民间的友好关系正在日益增进，中日两国人民对于进一步扩大两国间的友好往来，改善两国的关系以及发展两国间的经济合作和贸易关系，具有一种强烈的共同愿望。这种愿望是任何外力所不能阻挠和破坏的。
    二
    日本是一个现代工业比较发达的国家，它每年所生产的大量的工业品，有很大部分需要向国外市场销售；同时，日本工业需要的主要原料和日本人民必需的粮食，在相当程度上是依靠从国外输入。根据1956年5月日本通商产业省公布的统计材料，1955年日本所需要的铁砂有78.3％，炼焦煤有26.1％，盐有78.3％，大豆有61.4％，大米有9.5％，橡胶、棉花、铝矾土和磷灰石有100％必须依靠进口解决。因此对外贸易在日本国民经济中占着非常重要的地位。
    我国正在进行着大规模的经济建设，每年都需要进口大量的机器设备、工业材料和原料。我们对于日本生产的若干类型的设备和机器、船舶、钢材、化工原料和化学肥料等，是都有需要的。随着我国经济建设的发展和人民生活水平的不断提高，广大人民对于生活必需品的需要也日益增加，像我们这样一个拥有六亿人口的国家，社会购买力稍有增长，那么在商品需要量的增长方面，都是非常巨大的。另一方面，日本需要进口的商品，如铁砂、工业用盐、大豆、炼焦煤、大米等，过去若干年来主要是或者是相当大的一部分是依靠我国供应的，今后随着我国生产的发展，我们将有可能更加充分地供应日本的需要。
    这些情况都充分说明，发展中日两国间的贸易和经济合作，对于两国的经济发展都是非常必要的。只有这样，才符合两国人民的共同利益。如果中日两国能够在和平共处的基础上，根据平等互利、互不干涉内政的原则真正按照双方的需要和可能发展彼此间的贸易和经济合作，那么，对于繁荣两国的经济，特别是对于日本经济走向独立、健康发展和真正繁荣的道路，是有着非常重要的意义。正因如此，美国就想尽种种办法进行阻挠和破坏。我们深信，在中日两国人民的共同努力和全世界人民的支持下，美国人为地破坏中日两国间正常经济关系的措施，都将遭到彻底失败的。
    三
    有些关心中日贸易发展的日本朋友，在读了不久前中共第八次党代表大会通过的“关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议”以后，提出了这样一个疑问：就是随着中国社会主义工业化的发展，随着一个完整的工业体系在中国逐渐形成，中国对外国产品的需要是不是会逐年减少呢？中日贸易究竟有没有前途呢？他们特别对于周恩来总理在中共第八次党代表大会上“关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议”的报告中所指出的我们将“努力发展机器制造工业，特别是发展我们所需要的而又缺乏的各种大型设备、重型机床、精密机床和仪表等制造业，争取经过第二个五年计划的建设，使机器设备的自给率提高到70％左右”这一点感到忧虑，认为这样中国将来对进口机器的需要将会大大减少。
    这里，我希望大家注意这样一些事实，在第二个五年计划期间内，我国的基本建设投资将比第一个五年计划期间增加一倍左右，到1962年我国的工业生产将比1957年原计划增长一倍左右；农业生产在同一个时期也将增长35％左右；人民生活水平也将随之提高。建议中的各项指标的实现，将使我国的国民经济进一步高涨，人民购买力也将进一步提高。这就必然会促使我国的对外贸易也随之发展，也就是说，我国不仅将有更多的产品供应出口需要，同时我国需要进口的各种经济建设方面和人民生活方面的物资，不仅在数量上，同时在品种方面都将不断增加，这就为我国对外贸易的发展，开辟了美好的前途。
    至于我国今后对于机器的需要问题，根据周总理的报告，在第二个五年计划期间我国机器自给率将提高10％，在同一个报告中又指出，在第二个五年计划期间，国家对基本建设的投资将增加一倍左右，而且旧有的设备还需要不断地更新，我们可以这样说：在第二个五年计划期间，我国的机器生产仍然赶不上建设发展的需要，还需要从国外进口相当数量的机器。因之，某些日本朋友对这个问题所怀有的忧虑，显然是没有根据的。
    有人抱着这样一种错误的观点，他们认为，要扩大贸易，只有扼死对方国家的民族工业，使它们永远处于经济落后状态，成为强大的工业国家的商品销售市场和原料供应地，以达到剥削和榨取这些国家人民的目的。这是一种殖民主义的老办法，其结果只能使落后国家的经济越来越贫困，人民购买力越来越降低，市场越来越缩小，对外贸易日益萎缩。我们认为，只有在平等互利和促进各国经济不断发展的基础上，持续不断地扩大贸易，才是一条正确的道路。社会主义阵营国家间的对外贸易，就是在各国经济不断高涨的基础上逐渐扩大和发展起来的。几年来，我国对外贸易发展的情况也充分地证明了，实现国家工业化和发展国民经济，不仅不会引起对外贸易的缩小，反而为发展对外贸易提供了可靠的物质条件。1955年我国对外贸易总额比1950年增加了1.65倍，相当于1936年我国对外贸易总额的3.9倍，就是一个明显的例证。
    四
    从以上情况我们可以看出，发展中日贸易具有许多有利条件，而且有着广阔的发展前途。那么，中日贸易至今还未能充分发展的关键在那里呢？为了探讨这个问题，回顾一下几年来中日贸易发展的情况是有意义的。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，中日贸易曾经有过相当程度的恢复，但是自1951年以后，由于日本政府追随着美国的“禁运”措施，使中日两国的贸易关系遭到了严重的破坏。1952年我国对日本的贸易总值只相当于1950年的四分之一，几乎陷于完全停顿的状态。由于我国政府和中日两国人民的共同努力，才使两国贸易开始有了转机。从1952年到现在，两国人民团体间曾经签订了三次每次双方各出口三千万英镑的贸易协议和协定，第一次贸易协议在从1952年6月到1953年10月一年零四个月的时间内，仅实现了协议贸易额的5％左右；第二次贸易协议实现了38.8％；第三次贸易协议执行情况较前两次有了一些进展，即从1955年5月协议生效日起，到1956年4月底止，实现了56％左右，其中中国对日本的出口占协议金额的75％左右，日本对中国出口仅占协议金额的37％左右，还不及日本应出口的半数。造成三次贸易协议不能充分履行的原因，既不是因为日本没有可以供应的商品，也不是中国对于日本商品没有需要，而是由于日本政府追随美国对我国执行“禁运”措施，不发给出口许可证。也正是由于这个原因，仅仅在过去一年中，我国向日本订购的价值达七百八十多万英镑的合同未能实现，而合同中规定的商品，恰恰是日本方面销售困难和日本商人急于推销的商品。事实很明显，由于日本政府追随美国的“禁运”措施的结果，使日本方面受到很大的损失，因而招致日本人民和工商界人士极大的不满，我们对于这种情况也不能不感到十分遗憾。
    参加这次展览会的和来到中国访问的许多日本朋友都表示了他们和我们同样有着发展中日两国间的经济贸易关系和技术合作的愿望，他们非常注意中国的第二个五年计划，并且表示愿意在第二个五年计划期间能够同中国多做些生意。我们对于日本朋友的这种愿望表示欢迎。但是问题在于日本政府方面的态度和决策。我们的国家是实行计划经济的，我国国民经济各部门之间是相互配合、互相衔接的，一个环节落空就必然会影响到其它环节。为了将我们的计划建立在一个稳妥可靠的基础上，我们对于第二个五年计划期间所需要进口的机器设备和重要建设物资，必须及时地预先作好安排，并且选择那些最可靠的、完全有保证的市场为对象，来进行安排。我们愿意看到在第二个五年计划期间，有更多的日本产品在我国的经济建设基地上出现。
    我们相信，随着国际局势的日趋和缓，全世界广大人民要求和平共处、发展各国人民间的自由往来、发展国际间的贸易关系和经济合作的呼声将越来越高，日本人民对于获得政治上和经济上的独立自主、撤销“禁运”和发展中日间正常的经济贸易联系的需要也将越来越强烈。最近苏日会谈达成协议以后，日本人民已发出了迅速恢复同中国的正常关系的呼声。中国人民是同情日本人民这种要求的。现在，应该是日本政府以积极的态度来解决中日贸易关系正常化问题的时候了。（附图片）
