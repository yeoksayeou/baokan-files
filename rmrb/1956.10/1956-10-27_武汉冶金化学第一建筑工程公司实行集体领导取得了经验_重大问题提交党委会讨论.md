The person in charge of the Party Committee of the First Construction Engineering Company of Wuhan Metallurgical and Chemical Construction General Company introduced the situation and experience of their implementation of collective leadership at the Political Work Conference on Basic Construction convened by the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

Five months ago, the collective leadership system of the Party organization of this engineering company was not sound. At that time, although the Party Committee of this company established a system of collectively discussing major issues in production, these discussions were limited to arranging monthly plans. They rarely investigated and studied or collectively discussed key issues and major measures in enterprise management. In addition, Party Committee meetings were generally convened on a temporary basis, lacking preparation. The quality of the resolutions made at the meetings was not high, and their implementation was poor. From January to May of this year, the state plan was never completed.

Since June, the Party organization of this company has paid attention to improving and strengthening the Party's collective leadership. Major issues in the company's production work are submitted to the Party Committee for discussion and research. For example, in response to the serious problem that the company failed to complete the state plan from January to May, the Party Committee established a system of discussing and inspecting the plan on a monthly and quarterly basis, concentrating efforts to strengthen the enterprise's planning management work. In the past, the company's plans were not entirely realistic, and it was not easy for the workers to understand the plans. They were not confident when implementing them. Therefore, when the Party Committee discussed the monthly plan, it paid great attention to the practicality of the plan, focusing on researching whether construction conditions were available, identifying key issues in construction, proposing solutions, and stipulating that in the process of preparing the plan, it should first be discussed by each work section. After the plan was prepared, worker mass meetings or team leader meetings should be held at each construction site and work section to conduct detailed briefings and discussions, so that the plan was gradually made feasible and could be mastered by the workers.

In June, the slow progress of concrete engineering was the weakest link in the company's production. The Party Committee discussed and studied this issue, and at the same time transferred cadres from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League to go deep into the front lines to solve the key problems of concrete.

Now, after discussion, the Party Committee of this company is preparing to organize investigation and research to improve the enterprise's cost reduction and savings work.

After these major issues were discussed by the Party Committee and resolutions were made, the company's administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, under the unified leadership of the Party organization, divided their responsibilities and organized forces to realize them.

### 武汉冶金化学第一建筑工程公司实行集体领导取得了经验  重大问题提交党委会讨论

    武汉冶金化学第一建筑工程公司实行集体领导取得了经验
    重大问题提交党委会讨论
    据新华社讯　在中共武汉市委员会召开的基本建设政治工作会议上，中共武汉冶金化学建筑总公司第一建筑工程公司委员会的负责人，介绍了他们实行集体领导的情况和经验。
    五个月以前，这个工程公司的党组织的集体领导制度还不健全。当时，这个公司的党委会虽然建立了集体讨论生产中重大问题的制度，但是这些讨论仅仅局限于安排每月的计划，而对企业管理中的关键问题和重大措施，却很少调查研究和集体讨论，加上党委会议一般是临时召集，缺乏准备，会议所作的决议质量不高，贯彻执行得也不好，今年1月到5月，一直没有完成国家计划。
    从6月份起，这个公司的党组织注意改善和加强了党的集体领导，公司生产工作中的重大问题，都提交党委会讨论和研究。例如，针对这个公司1月到5月没有完成国家计划这一严重问题，党委会建立了按月按季讨论和检查计划的制度，集中力量加强企业的计划管理工作。过去这个公司的计划不尽切合实际，职工群众也不容易了解计划，贯彻执行的时候心中无数。因此，党委会在讨论每月计划的时候，十分注意计划的切实性，突出的研究是否具备施工条件，找出施工中的关键问题，提出解决的措施，并且规定在编制计划过程中，先要经过各工段的讨论，编出计划以后，要在各工地、工段召开职工群众大会或班组长会议，进行详细交底和讨论，这样，就逐步做到了计划切实可行，而且能为职工群众掌握。
    6月份，混凝土工程进度迟缓，是这个公司生产中最薄弱的环节。党委会讨论和研究了这个问题，同时抽调党、行政、工会和青年团的干部深入现场，解决了混凝土关键问题。
    现在，这个公司的党委会经过讨论，正着手组织调查研究，准备改善企业降低成本和节约的工作。
    这些重大问题经过党委会讨论并作出决议以后，这个公司的行政、工会和青年团就在党组织的统一领导下，分工负责，组织力量来实现。
