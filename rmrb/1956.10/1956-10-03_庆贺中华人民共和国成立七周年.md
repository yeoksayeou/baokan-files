    To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

    On the occasion of the great seventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we would like to extend our warm greetings and congratulations to you on behalf of all Argentine communists, while expressing the feelings of fraternal solidarity of our people with the historically significant anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle of your people. The liberation of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party has opened up a great prospect for building socialism in a short period of time, as the analysis made by the Eighth Party Congress shows. The Argentine people, as well as the people of other Latin American countries, deeply admire your historically significant achievements, which have become an inspiration in their struggle for national independence, democracy, and peace. The Chinese experience is invaluable in proving that the unity of the people in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal national democratic front is the road to liberation.

    Fraternal greetings!

    On the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, please allow me to extend to you my warmest congratulations. The great achievements made by the Chinese people in the short years since the founding of their People's Republic and the enormous tasks for the future proposed by the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China demonstrate the enormous strength of the new China and its power. Maintaining such a close and friendly relationship with a free and strong China is a first in German history.
