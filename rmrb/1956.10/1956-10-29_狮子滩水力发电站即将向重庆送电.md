Shizitan Hydropower Station to Soon Transmit Electricity to Chongqing

    Our reporter Li Ce reports: The Shizitan Hydropower Station will soon formally transmit electricity to Chongqing. The first generating unit was test-run on the night of National Day. The test run proved that the performance of this generating unit, manufactured by our own country, is excellent.

    Inside the dark grey factory building, installation personnel are working around the clock to accelerate the installation of the second, third, and fourth turbine generators. The second unit will be installed before the end of the year, and the other two will be installed in the first quarter of next year. With the experience of the first unit, the work is very smooth. Each coil has undergone a withstand voltage test, and the quality meets the specifications.

    The various civil engineering projects of the hydropower station are reaching the final stage. The workers building the dam have completed this year's workload 96 days ahead of schedule, striving to complete the dam by the end of November. Motor vehicles are pulling dump trucks full of rocks on two narrow-gauge railways, rushing and dumping large quantities of rocks behind the dam. The construction of the three small dams is also being accelerated. The water diversion system project is basically completed, leaving only the installation of a cover on the surge tank, which can be done this month.

    Before the completion of the project, more than 700 employees have been transferred to the future Minjiang Hydropower Station construction site. More than 170 people have been transferred to build the third-level hydropower station on the Longxi River – the Huilongzhai Hydropower Station. Personnel going to participate in the Sanmenxia and Yunnan Yili River Hydropower Stations are departing one after another.

    狮子滩水力发电站即将向重庆送电
    本报记者李策报道　狮子滩水力发电站即将正式向重庆送电。第一台机组已于国庆节夜间试发一次电。试运转期间证明，我国自己制造的这台机组的性能是优等的。
    在深灰色的厂房里，安装人员正昼夜不停地加紧安装第二、三、四台水轮发电机。第二台将在年前安装好，另两台将在明年第一季度安装好。由于有了第一台机组的经验，工作十分顺手。对每个线卷，都经过耐压试验，质量都合乎规格。
    水电站的各项土建工程到了结尾的阶段，修建拦河坝的工人们提前九十六天完成了今年的工作量，争取在11月底把大坝修好。机关车拖着装满石块的斗车在两条轻便铁路上，哗哗地奔跑，把大批的石块倒在大坝的背后。三条小坝的工程也在加紧进行。引水系统的工程基本结束了，只剩下在调压井上安一个井盖，本月内就可以做好。
    在工程结束前，七百多个职工已调到了未来的岷江水电站工地。一百七十多人则调去修建龙溪河第三级水电站——回龙寨水电站。去参加三门峡、云南以礼河水电站的人员，正陆续出发。
