Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Electric Dispatch: According to the person in charge of the Jiangjin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, this year the farmers in this county, after paying public grain, selling fixed-quota grain to the state, and deducting 500 jin of rations per person, have an average surplus grain of more than 190 jin per person, more than double that of last year.

Although this county is one of the grain-producing areas in Sichuan Province and a county with relatively high grain yields in the hilly areas of Sichuan, there were still many grain-deficient households in previous years. Only this year have they all become surplus grain households. In the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative of Degan Township, many farmers were grain-deficient households in the years before the establishment of the cooperative this year; this year, the cooperative's grain production increased by 50%. After fulfilling the task of selling 24,000 jin of grain to the state and deducting rations, the average surplus grain per person is more than 300 jin.

Due to the bumper harvest in many grain-deficient areas of the county, this year they are also requesting a reduction in the amount of grain supplied. It is estimated that the amount of grain supplied in the county's rural areas can be reduced by 4.8 million jin compared to last year.

    江津县农民余粮增多
    据新华社成都电　据中共四川省江津县委员会负责人谈：今年这个县的农民，在缴纳公粮、向国家出售定购粮食和除去每个人五百斤口粮以后，平均每人还有余粮一百九十多斤，比去年多一倍以上。
    这个县虽然是四川省的产粮地区之一，是四川丘陵地区粮食产量较多的县，但是往年还有许多缺粮户。只有到了今年才都变成了余粮户。德感乡光明农业社，在今年建社以前的几年中，很多农民都是缺粮户；今年全社粮食增产50％，除了完成向国家出售定购粮食二万四千斤的任务和留除口粮外，平均每人还有余粮三百多斤。
    这个县许多缺粮地区由于丰收，今年也要求减少粮食供应数量。预计全县在农村中供应的粮食可比去年减少四百八十万斤。
