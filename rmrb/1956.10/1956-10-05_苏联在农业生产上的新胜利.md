New Victories in Agricultural Production in the Soviet Union
　　Zhang Ye

　　This year, the crops in the Soviet Union have grown well almost everywhere, and harvests have been abundant almost everywhere. The total grain output will exceed any previous year, and the amount of grain obtained by the state will exceed the highest level in history. This is a new and great victory for the Soviet Union in agricultural production, and is the result of the Soviet people's enthusiastic implementation of the great call of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union to reclaim virgin and fallow land to increase grain production.

　　The Soviet Union solved the grain problem long ago as having enough grain to supply the residents with bread. However, the level of agricultural production in the Soviet Union is not yet able to fully meet the residents' growing needs for food and light industry and the food industry, and for raw materials. Therefore, while continuing to vigorously develop heavy industry, we must strive for rapid upsurges in all sectors of agriculture. To accomplish this important task, it is necessary to rapidly develop the grain industry, because the grain industry is the foundation of the entire agricultural production. And a most reliable source of increasing grain production is the reclamation of virgin and fallow land.

　　In order to utilize this reliable potential for increasing grain production by reclaiming wasteland, the 2nd-3rd Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU in February-March 1954 adopted the "Resolution on Further Expanding Grain Production and on Reclaiming Virgin and Fallow Land," stipulating that at least 13 million hectares of virgin and fallow land should be reclaimed in Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, the Volga River Basin, and parts of the North Caucasus in 1954-1955. In August 1954, the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, because the wasteland reclamation work was progressing rapidly, adopted another resolution to add to the task of reclaiming wasteland, stipulating that at least another 15 million hectares of virgin and fallow land should be reclaimed by 1956. In this way, by 1956, the grain sowing area in the newly cultivated areas of the Soviet Union would increase to at least 28 million to 30 million hectares.

　　Such a large-scale reclamation of wasteland is not only the first time in the history of the Soviet Union, but has never happened in the history of the world. Therefore, the Soviet Union's wasteland reclamation measures have aroused suspicion and ridicule from some people in capitalist countries. For example, Hearst, a member of the US agricultural delegation that visited the Soviet Union in July and August 1955, told reporters after returning to New York that the Soviet Union's plan to reclaim wasteland "is still a gamble" and said that "analyzing this plan, it does not seem as effective as it appears on the surface." In the Soviet Union, in the early stages of the plan to reclaim wasteland, some people were worried that some reclaimed areas had little rainfall and were often arid, and they were afraid that the harvest would not be good.

　　However, two years have passed, and the facts are the greatest eloquence. The Soviet people's plan to reclaim wasteland has been victoriously and overfulfilled! The virgin and fallow land reclaimed in the past three years is not the original plan of 13 million hectares, nor the added 28 million to 30 million hectares, but 35.5 million hectares. Four hundred and twenty-five new large state-owned grain farms have been established on the wasteland, thereby expanding the sowing area by more than 30 million hectares in the last three years. This is not a "gamble" as Hearst ridiculed, but a heroic struggle to transform nature.

　　What is the harvest situation in the wasteland reclamation areas? The virgin and fallow land reclaimed in 1954 produced several hundred million poods of grain more for the country. In 1955, mainly due to the reclamation of wasteland, the sown area of various crops increased by 19.7 million hectares compared with 1954, and increased by nearly 29 million hectares compared with two years ago. Therefore, although the climatic conditions in some areas were not good, the total grain output of the entire Soviet Union still increased. This year, coupled with good climatic conditions, the reclamation areas have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. For example, the Kazakh Republic, which was previously considered to be backward in grain production and did not have much potential, has undergone fundamental changes in just two years due to the reclamation of wasteland. In the past, Kazakhstan only provided the state with 50 million to 70 million poods of grain annually, and 100 million poods in the best years. This year, in terms of grain output, this republic has surpassed Ukraine, which is known as the "granary" of the Soviet Union, and ranks second in the Soviet Union after the Russian Federation. The agricultural workers of Kazakhstan guarantee to hand over 1 billion poods of grain to the state, which is almost ten times the highest sales volume in the past. The Russian Federation Republic will sell 2.2 billion poods of grain to the state, which is about the same as the total grain purchase volume of the entire Soviet Union not long ago. Among them, Siberia, the most important reclamation area, will sell 1 billion poods of grain to the state this year. In addition to the grain sold to the state by the Ukrainian Republic this year, the three republics with the highest grain production this year can sell a total of 3.66 billion poods of grain to the state. This unprecedented bumper harvest proves the correctness of the Soviet Communist Party's policy put forward two years ago of greatly increasing grain production by reclaiming virgin and fallow land.

　　This Soviet harvest is of great national economic significance: it can already meet the basic needs of residents for grain and high-quality grain; more grain can be used as livestock feed and more land can be allocated to grow feed crops to develop animal husbandry; land can be allocated in reclamation areas and other areas to grow technical crops to increase the supply of raw materials to light industry; there can be more food reserves, and more food can be used for export and assistance to fraternal countries and other countries in need of food. Moreover, judging from this year's bumper grain harvest, the plan to increase agricultural products stipulated in the Sixth Five-Year Plan will be greatly advanced and overfulfilled.

　　The reason why the great task of the Soviet Union to reclaim wasteland to increase grain production has been overfulfilled is primarily due to the strong foundation of socialist industry, especially heavy industry, which can supply the reclamation areas with various agricultural machines in large quantities. In the past two years, 208,000 tractors (each calculated as 15 horsepower), more than 50,000 combine harvesters, and more than 30,000 automobiles have been supplied to the reclamation areas, thus ensuring the completion of the arduous task of reclaiming a large amount of wasteland in the shortest possible time with the least manpower. Secondly, it is the warm support and active participation of the entire Soviet people, especially young men and women, for the call to reclaim wasteland. Three hundred and fifty thousand volunteer wasteland reclaimers came to the reclamation areas from all over the country to reclaim land that had never been used before. This year, another 200,000 young men and women from all over the country voluntarily went to the reclamation areas to participate in harvesting work. They demonstrated the Soviet people's highly conscious labor enthusiasm and heroism in fighting against nature, and created immortal labor achievements. Most importantly, it is due to the superiority of the Soviet socialist system, and the constant concern of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government for the people's material well-being, mobilizing the people to turn wastelands into fertile fields to meet the people's growing needs.

　　The Soviet Union's wasteland reclamation work has definitely achieved great victories. Now, the collective farms and state farms in the reclamation areas are striving to overfulfill the plan to sell grain to the state, and are carrying out various basic construction projects in the reclamation areas to consolidate the achievements of wasteland reclamation. In the future, we will continue to reclaim virgin and fallow land that does not require a large amount of investment and can obtain high and stable yields, in order to raise the Soviet Union's grain output to a higher level.

    苏联在农业生产上的新胜利
    章叶
    今年，苏联的庄稼几乎到处都长得很好，几乎到处都获得丰收，谷物总产量将超过已往的任何一年，国家所获得的谷物数量将超过历史上的最高水平。这是苏联在农业生产上的一个新的巨大胜利，是苏联人民热情实现苏共中央和苏联部长会议的开垦生荒地和熟荒地以增加谷物生产的伟大号召的结果。
    作为有足够的谷物来供应居民面包的谷物问题，苏联早就解决了。但是，苏联的农业生产水平还不能充分满足居民对于粮食及轻工业和食品工业、对于原料的日益增长的需要。因此，要在继续大力发展重工业的同时，力求农业各部门达到迅速的高涨。要完成这一项重要任务，必须迅速发展谷物业，因为谷物业是整个农业生产的基础。而增加谷物生产的一个最可靠的源泉就是开垦生荒地和熟荒地。
    为了利用这个开垦荒地增加谷物生产的可靠潜力，苏共中央委员会1954年2—3月全会通过了“关于进一步扩大谷物生产和关于开垦生荒地和熟荒地的决议”，规定1954—1955年在哈萨克斯坦、西伯利亚、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域和北高加索部分地区至少开垦一千三百万公顷的生荒地和熟荒地。1954年8月，苏共中央委员会和苏联部长会议因为开荒工作进展得很快，又通过了一项决议，追加开垦荒地的任务，规定到1956年至少再开垦一千五百万公顷的生荒地和熟荒地。这样，到1956年苏联新垦区的谷物播种面积就至少增加到两千八百万到三千万公顷。
    这样大规模地开垦荒地，不仅在苏联的历史上是第一次，就是在世界历史上也还没有过。因此，苏联的开荒措施引起资本主义国家某些人士的怀疑和讥讽，例如在1955年7、8月间访问苏联的美国农业代表团的团员赫斯特在回到纽约以后，就曾向新闻记者说，苏联开垦荒地的计划“仍然是一场赌博”，并且说“分析一下这个计划，它不像可能从表面上看来那样有效”。而在苏联国内，在开垦荒地的计划提出的初期，也还有人担心有些开垦地区的雨量少，常常干旱，恐怕收成不好。
    但是，两年过去了，事实是最大的雄辩，苏联人民开垦荒地的计划是胜利地并且超额地完成了！在过去三年中开垦的生荒地和熟荒地不是原计划的一千三百万公顷，也不是追加以后的两千八百万到三千万公顷，而是三千五百五十万公顷。在生荒地上建立了四百二十五个新的大型国营谷物农场，从而使最近三年来的播种面积扩大了三千多万公顷。这不是像赫斯特所讥讽的“一场赌博”，而是一场英勇的改造大自然的斗争。
    开荒地区的收获的情形怎样呢？1954年开垦的生荒地和熟荒地为国家多生产了几亿普特的谷物。1955年，主要由于开垦了荒地，各种农作物的播种面积比1954年增加了一千九百七十万公顷，和两年以前相比几乎增加了两千九百万公顷，因而，虽然某些地区的气候条件不好，而全苏联的谷物总产量还是增加了。今年又加上气候条件好，开垦地区获得了空前未有的大丰收。例如，哈萨克共和国，过去认为它在生产谷物方面是落后的，并且没有多大潜力，但是，由于开垦了荒地，仅仅两年时间就发生了根本的变化。过去哈萨克每年只向国家提供五千万到七千万普特、年成最好的时候达到一亿多普特谷物，而在今年，按谷物产量来说，这个共和国已经超过了素称苏联“谷仓”的乌克兰，仅次于俄罗斯联邦而占全苏联的第二位，哈萨克的农业劳动者保证要交给国家十亿普特谷物，差不多等于过去最高交售量的十倍。俄罗斯联邦共和国则要交售给国家二十二亿普特谷物，这个数目大约相当于不久以前全苏联的谷物采购量，其中西伯利亚这个最重要的开垦地区今年就要交售给国家十亿普特谷物。加上乌克兰共和国今年交售给国家的谷物，今年生产谷物最多的三个共和国总共可以交售给国家三十六亿六千万普特谷物。这个空前大丰收证明苏联共产党在两年以前提出的用开垦生荒地和熟荒地的办法来大大增加谷物生产的方针的正确。
    苏联这次丰收是具有重大的国民经济意义的：它已经可以满足居民对谷物以及优等谷物的基本需要；可以用更多的谷物作牲畜饲料和拨出更多的土地来种植饲料作物以发展畜牧业；可以在开垦地区和其他地区拨出土地种植技术作物以增加对轻工业的原料供应；可以有更多的粮食储备，有更多的粮食供输出和援助需要粮食的兄弟国家及其他国家之用。而且从今年谷物的大丰收看来，将大大提前并超额完成第六个五年计划规定的增加农产品的计划。
    苏联开垦荒地以增加谷物生产的伟大任务之所以超额完成，首先是由于有强大的社会主义工业，特别是重工业的基础，能够大量供应开垦地区以各种农业机器。两年来供应开垦地区的拖拉机达二十万零八千台（每台以十五马力计算）、联合收获机五万多台、汽车三万多辆，因而保证了用最少的人力在最短期间内来完成开垦大量荒地的艰巨任务。其次是苏联全体人民、特别是青年男女对于开垦荒地的号召的热烈拥护和积极参加。有三十五万志愿垦荒者从各地来到开垦地区开垦从来没有被人利用过的土地，而今年又有二十多万青年男女从全国各地自愿到开垦地区参加收割工作，他们表现了苏联人民高度自觉的劳动热情和同大自然作斗争的英雄主义，创造了不朽的劳动功绩。而最重要的，是由于苏联社会主义制度的优越性，是由于苏联共产党和苏联政府关怀人民的物质福利生活的不断高涨，动员人民把荒原变成良田，以满足人民日益增长的需要。
    苏联开垦荒地的工作已经肯定地获得了巨大的胜利，现在开垦地区的集体农庄和国营农场正在为争取超额完成向国家交售谷物的计划，并且在开垦地区进行各项基本建设，以巩固开荒的成绩。今后还要继续开垦不需要大量投资而又能获得高额稳定收成的生荒地和熟荒地，以便把苏联的谷物产量提到更高的水平。
