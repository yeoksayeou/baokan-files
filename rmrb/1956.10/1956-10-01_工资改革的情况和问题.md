The Situation and Problems of Wage Reform
Speech by Comrade Liu Ziju, Deputy Minister of Labor

In the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai, the wage issue was mentioned. I would like to briefly share some opinions on this issue.

The Party's Basic Policy on Wages

The wage issue is a fundamental issue in the Party's social policy because it directly reflects the relationship between production and livelihood, individual interests and collective interests, and immediate interests and long-term interests. From the perspective of the wage issue itself, there are basically two questions: the wage level and the wage system. The task of wage work is to appropriately arrange wage levels and improve the wage system based on the needs of national production development and the principle of "to each according to their work," so that wages can better serve the development of production, the improvement of workers' lives, the enhancement of workers' ideological awareness, and the strengthening of internal unity among workers.

In recent years, the Party's basic policy on wages has been to gradually improve the material and cultural lives of workers on the basis of developing production and increasing labor productivity. The First Five-Year Plan stipulated that industrial labor productivity should increase by 64 percent, and the average wage of all employees should increase by 33 percent. This ratio is appropriate from the perspective of the relationship between workers' individual interests and collective interests, and immediate interests and long-term interests.

In recent years, in state-owned industrial enterprises, with the development of production and the increase in labor productivity, the wage levels of workers have generally increased substantially. If we take the labor productivity and average wages of workers in 1950 as 100, then the labor productivity in 1955 was 189.1, and the average wage of workers was 171.9. At the same time, in terms of the wage system, some have undergone one reform, and some have undergone several reforms, thereby gradually moving towards rationality, enabling socialist competition and the advanced producer movement to be widely and persistently carried out.

Problems Existing in Wages in Recent Years

The main problems existing in wages in recent years are: 1. There is still egalitarianism, and phenomena that do not conform to the principle of "to each according to their work." The wages of some unskilled workers are higher than those of skilled workers, the wages of some workers engaged in light labor are higher than those of workers engaged in heavy labor, and the wages of some light industrial workers are higher than those of heavy industrial workers. This cannot materially encourage workers to study technology diligently and improve their skills, nor can it materially encourage workers to engage in heavy labor. 2. The wages of workers in some newly built industrial bases with relatively difficult living conditions are lower than those of workers in old industrial bases with relatively less difficult living conditions. This increases the difficulty of transferring workers from old industrial bases to support new industrial bases. 3. The speed of wage growth between years is too uneven (not commensurate with the growth of labor productivity). This is prominently reflected in the problem that the speed of wage growth in 1954 and 1955 was excessively lower than the increase in labor productivity. Some of the above problems are legacies of history, but some (such as the slow wage growth in 1954 and 1955) are caused by our own lack of scientific knowledge and practical work experience on wage issues, as well as bureaucratic tendencies of not caring about workers' lives.

Conducting a Comprehensive Wage Reform

In order to further solve these problems existing in wages, so that the wage situation of workers is more in line with the current needs of China's production development and appropriately improve the lives of workers, the Party Central Committee and the State Council decided to conduct a comprehensive wage reform throughout the country this year. This reform is still in progress. In order to compensate for the defect of the slow wage growth of workers in the past two years, the increase in wages in this wage reform is relatively large, and the average monthly wage of workers has increased by about 13 percent compared with 1955. At the same time, under the favorable conditions of this relatively large wage increase, relatively large improvements have been made to the wage grade system for workers, the wage system for staff, and the wage relations between industries, regions, and various types of personnel. The increase in workers' wage levels and the improvement of the wage system will have, and have already begun to have, positive effects and good results in improving labor productivity, improving workers' lives, enhancing workers' awareness, and strengthening workers' unity.

Based on the favorable conditions of this year's relatively large wage increase, the policies adopted this time for improving the current wage system are: not to move wages that are too high, to increase slightly wages that are slightly high, and to increase more wages that are low; to give relatively large increases to the wages of senior intellectuals, scientific and technical personnel, and skilled workers; and to also give relatively large increases to the wages of rural primary school teachers, grassroots cooperative employees, and township cadres whose current wage treatment is too low. This method is used to gradually rationalize the current wage system and wage relations. There is no doubt that this policy is in line with the requirements of the broad masses of workers and the needs of national production development. In determining and implementing the policy of "not moving wages that are too high, increasing slightly wages that are slightly high, and increasing more wages that are low," we encountered two ideological obstacles: one is the idea of "reaching the sky in one step," which often occurs among those with low wages, enterprises, and regions; the other is the unwillingness to actively improve, which often occurs among those with high wages, enterprises, and regions.

In the process of formulating and implementing the wage reform plan, everyone was most interested in, debated the most, the longest, and the most fiercely about the issue of increasing wage figures. This is one of the important reasons why various wage conferences often take a long time to convene. This phenomenon essentially reflects the contradiction between the current level of production development in our country and meeting the living needs of workers. This contradiction cannot be solved in a short period of time. Under the socialist system, the most fundamental and effective way to solve this contradiction is to actively develop production and strive to improve labor productivity. There is no other way out. This phenomenon also reflects the contradiction between local interests and overall interests, and this contradiction can only be resolved temporarily and relatively rationally under the premise of taking care of each other and local interests obeying overall interests.

Some Issues Worth Noting

Emphasizing life, paying little attention to production; emphasizing wage levels, neglecting the improvement of the wage system; emphasizing increasing wages, neglecting political and ideological education

The wage reform plan was formulated under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and through the joint discussion and research of trade union organizations, relevant central departments, and local Party and government organs. Therefore, from the current situation, this plan is basically reasonable and feasible, except for the wage plan for construction workers, which has more problems due to the change in the working hour system. From the progress of wage reform work in various places, it is generally considered to be smooth and healthy. As for what successful or erroneous experiences there are in this wage reform, the final conclusion must be made after a comprehensive inspection and summary. However, based on the information we know and the materials we have, we have already seen some issues that deserve our attention. I would like to briefly mention these issues here for the comrades to pay attention to.

First, after criticizing the bias of one-sidedly emphasizing production and not caring about the lives of workers (increasing wages too little), some comrades have somewhat emphasized life and paid little attention to production. As mentioned earlier, the wage increase target set by the state this year can no longer be considered low. From the perspective of national finance, material supply, and the proportional relationship between wage growth and labor productivity, it has reached or almost reached the saturation point. However, after this wage growth target was issued, many regions and departments requested to raise the target again. The newly added figures in some units even exceeded twice the originally issued wage growth target. This phenomenon cannot be considered normal in any way. Some leading cadres in some units have the idea that regardless of whether their labor productivity plan, profit delivery plan, and cost reduction plan can be completed, they should first increase wages and create an accomplished fact. This idea and practice are likely to create passivity in future production management and wage work.

Second, there is somewhat of an emphasis on wage levels and a neglect of improving the wage system. As mentioned earlier, this year's relatively large wage increase was originally a favorable condition for improving the wage system, but if this favorable condition is not used well, it will reduce the role of wage reform, and sometimes even have a counterproductive effect. Here are two examples of this situation:

One belongs to the aspect of worker upgrading. After criticizing the error of excessively controlling the scope of worker upgrading in the past, resulting in workers upgrading too slowly, another situation occurred in this year's worker upgrading work, that is, the phenomenon of blindly upgrading without strictly following the technical grade standards, let alone asking whether it is needed in production. In many enterprises, the scope of worker upgrading reached 70 or 80 percent, and some even reached 100 percent. The result of blindly upgrading workers in this way is to waste wage funds, increase the cost of products, disrupt the labor organization and staffing system in enterprises, make the technical grades of workers inconsistent with their job grades, aggravate the unreasonable phenomenon of senior workers doing low-level work, cause internal disunity among workers, hinder the promotion of the piece-rate wage system, and increase the difficulty of external transfer of employees, and so on.

The other belongs to the aspect of wages for engineering and technical personnel and staff. Based on the needs of the country's socialist industrialization and the current shortage of engineering and technical personnel in our country, it is necessary and reasonable to stipulate that the wages of engineering and technical personnel are higher than those of non-engineering and technical personnel. This issue has been resolved more reasonably in enterprises that implement the job wage system. Because in the job wage plan, relatively appropriate arrangements have been made for the wage relationship between engineering and technical personnel and financial and economic staff. The problem is that in state organs, institutions, and some enterprises, the wage standards of engineering and technical personnel are not determined according to their positions, but rather a so-called "two-line" method is implemented, so that the wage relationship between engineering and technical personnel and financial and economic staff has not been improved in this wage reform, and in some cases, the original contradictions have been exacerbated. Therefore, this has aroused the dissatisfaction of financial and economic staff in state organs, institutions, and some enterprises. Among them, some ditties are popular: "Boys study engineering, girls study medicine, studying finance and economics is useless"; "Don't blame a thousand times, don't blame ten thousand times, only blame that you didn't enter an engineering college before."

The above two examples are the adverse consequences brought to us by the idea and practice of one-sidedly emphasizing raising wage levels and neglecting the improvement of the wage system.

Third, there is somewhat of an emphasis on increasing wages and a neglect of political and ideological education. Here, I would like to quote a few sentences from a telegram from the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee on September 15th – “On the Issue of Wages for Enterprise Leading Cadres” – to illustrate: “In some regions, many enterprises have paid more attention to the issue of wages for cadres, especially leading cadres, in this wage reform, and less attention to the wages of workers. Most enterprises have failed to strictly abide by and implement the State Council’s regulations that the wage increase range for enterprise leading cadres generally does not exceed 20 percent. According to calculations, the wage increases of leading cadres in the 21 factories under the Nanchang City Industrial Bureau all exceeded 20 percent, generally increasing by more than 40 percent, and some even increased to 100 percent to 200 percent. In addition, most cadres were reassessed by disrupting the original wage grades, including upgrading factors, and reissued from April, with a large amount of wages reissued at one time. This squeezed out the wage growth target for workers, causing fluctuations in the emotions of workers. The steps stipulated by the province for wage reform are workers first and then cadres, but many units conducted workers and cadres at the same time. Some units stopped to assess the levels of cadres while trying out the grades of workers. Some unit leaders became entangled in the wage issues of cadres and relaxed the ideological education work for workers, so that some ideological problems that occurred among workers were not resolved quickly." Of course, under the control of such an ideological emotion of striving to increase their own wages more, where would the leading cadres have the time, emotion, and mind to carry out political and ideological education work for the workers? Because our propaganda on wage reform policies is not deep, not thorough, not specific, and not comprehensive, although wages have increased a lot this year, some workers still have opinions, saying: "Big thunder, little rain," "Only thunder, no rain." In fact, the wage income of those with "little rain", that is, less increase or "no rain", that is, no increase, is still more than that of those with "heavy rain", that is, more increase, and some are even much more. If we explain this actual situation clearly to the workers based on the principle of "to each according to their work" and "equal pay for equal work", the workers will not have any opinions on the above policies, nor should they have any opinions. It proves once again that under any circumstances, doing any work, if we neglect political and ideological education work, we will certainly not get good results.

Hope that Party Committees at All Levels Will Strengthen Leadership Over Wage Work

Wages are closely related to the interests of every worker and their family members, and everyone is very concerned about this issue. If we do not pay attention to investigation and research, are not realistic, do not pay attention to the principle of "to each according to their work", do not implement the method of the mass line, do not adopt the policy of steady progress, and do not strengthen political and ideological education work, then, on the wage issue, it is easier to make mistakes of subjectivism, bureaucracy, and departmentalism than on other issues, and it is easier to become divorced from the masses.

Our understanding of the situation of the wage issue is still very insufficient, and our experience in wage work is also very lacking. Therefore, we have not yet grasped its characteristics and its development laws well. Wages are a weak link in the current work of various departments of the national economy. We have made this or that mistake on this issue. If we do not summarize the past well, especially the experience of this wage reform work, then the mistakes we have made in the past will be repeated. Therefore, we hope that Party committees at all levels will strengthen leadership over wage work, especially do a good job in the inspection and summary work of this wage reform, so as to overcome this weak link in our work, so that our wage work can move forward on the basis of this wage reform, and so that wages can give full play to their leverage role in the great cause of building socialism in our country.

    工资改革的情况和问题
    劳动部副部长　刘子久同志的发言
    在刘少奇同志和周恩来同志的报告中，都讲到了工资问题。我想就这个问题，简单地讲一点意见。
    党对工资问题的基本政策
    工资问题，是党在社会政策方面一个带有根本性质的问题。因为它直接体现着生产和生活的关系、个人利益和集体利益的关系、眼前利益和长远利益的关系。从工资问题的本身来讲，基本上是两个问题，就是工资水平问题和工资制度问题。工资工作的任务，就是要根据国家发展生产的需要和按劳取酬的原则来适当地安排工资水平和改进工资制度，使工资能够更好地为发展生产、改善职工生活、提高职工思想觉悟、加强职工内部团结服务。
    几年来，党对工资问题的基本政策就是在发展生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上，逐步地改善职工的物质生活和文化生活。在第一个五年计划中规定，工业的劳动生产率提高百分之六十四，全体职工的平均工资增加百分之三十三。这个比例，从职工的个人利益和集体利益、眼前利益和长远利益的关系看来，是恰当的。
    几年来，在国营工业企业里，随着生产的发展和劳动生产率的提高，职工的工资水平一般地都有相当大的提高，如果以一九五○年职工的劳动生产率和平均工资都为一百的话，那么一九五五年的劳动生产率为一百八十九点一，职工的平均工资则为一百七十一点九。同时，在工资制度方面，有的经过一次改革，有的经过数次改革，从而逐步走向合理，使社会主义竞赛和先进生产者运动能够广泛而持久地开展起来。
  近年来在工资方面存在的问题
    近年来，在工资方面所存在的问题，主要的是：1、仍然有平均主义，不合乎按劳取酬原则的现象。有些不熟练工人的工资反而比熟练工人的工资还高，有些从事轻便劳动的工人的工资反而比从事繁重劳动的工人的工资还高，有些轻工业工人的工资反而比重工业工人的工资还高，这就不能从物质上鼓励工人努力学习技术、提高技术，不能从物质上鼓励工人从事繁重劳动。2、有些生活条件比较艰苦的新建工业基地的职工的工资反而比那些生活条件比较不大艰苦的老工业基地的职工的工资还低，这就增加了从老的工业基地调动职工去支援新建工业基地的困难。3、年度之间工资增长的速度太不均衡（和劳动生产率的增长不相适应），这突出地表现在一九五四年和一九五五年的工资增长速度过分低于劳动生产率提高这个问题上。上述这些问题，有些是历史上遗留下来的，但是也有一部分（如一九五四和一九五五年工资增长速度太慢）是由于我们自己对于工资问题缺乏科学知识和实际工作经验，以及不关心职工生活的官僚主义所造成的。
    全面地进行一次工资改革
    为了进一步解决在工资方面所存在着的这些问题，使职工的工资状况更加符合我国当前发展生产的需要和适当的改善职工生活，党中央和国务院决定，今年，在全国范围内，全面地进行一次工资改革。这种改革目前还在进行中。为了弥补过去两年职工工资增长太慢的缺陷，在这次工资改革中，工资增加的幅度比较大，职工的月平均工资比一九五五年提高了百分之十三左右。同时，在这种增加工资比较多的有利的条件下，对于工人的工资等级制度、职员的工资制度以及产业之间、地区之间和各类人员之间的工资关系，都作了比较大的改进。职工工资水平的提高和工资制度的改进，在提高劳动生产率、改善职工生活、提高职工觉悟、加强职工团结等方面，都将产生而且已经开始产生积极的作用和良好的效果。
    根据今年增加工资比较多的这个有利条件，这次对于现行工资制度的改进方面所采取的政策是：过高的不动，稍高的稍增，低的多增；对于高级知识分子、科学技术人员和熟练工人的工资，有较多的提高；对于现行工资待遇太低的乡村小学教员、基层合作社的营业员以及乡干部的工资，也有较多的提高。用这种办法来使现行的工资制度和工资关系逐步地达到合理。毫无疑问，这种政策是符合广大职工群众的要求和国家发展生产的需要的。在我们确定和贯彻执行“过高的不动，稍高的稍增，低的多增”的这一政策的时候，遇到了两种思想阻碍：一种是“一步登天”的思想，这种思想常常发生在那些低工资的人员、企业和地区中；另一种是不愿积极改进的思想，这种思想常常发生在那些高工资的人员、企业和地区中。
    在制定和贯彻执行工资改革方案的过程中，对于增加工资的数字问题，大家最感兴趣，争论的最多、最久、最厉害。这是各种工资会议常常开得很久的重要的原因之一。这种现象实质上是反映了目前我国的生产发展水平与满足职工生活需要之间的矛盾，这种矛盾不是短时期所能解决的。在社会主义制度下，解决这个矛盾的最根本最有效的办法，就是积极发展生产，努力提高劳动生产率，别的出路是没有的。这种现象，同时也是反映了局部利益与整体利益之间的矛盾，而这种矛盾只有在彼此互相照顾、局部服从整体的前提下，才能求得暂时的相对的合理的解决。
        一些值得注意的问题
    强调生活，不大注意生产；强调工资水平，忽视改进工资制度；重视增加工资，忽视政治思想教育
    这次工资改革的方案，是在党中央和国务院的直接领导下，在工会组织、中央各有关部门以及地方的党、政的共同讨论研究下制定的。因此，这个方案，从当前的情况来看，除了建筑工人的工资方案因为改变工时制度的关系，存在的问题比较多以外，基本上是合理的可行的。从各地工资改革工作的进行情况来看，一般地也算是顺利的健康的。至于这次工资改革究竟有哪些成功的或者是错误的经验，必须等到全面检查总结了之后，才能作最后的结论。但是就我们知道的情况和掌握的材料来看，已经看出一些值得我们注意的问题，我想在这里把这些问题简单地提一下，请同志们注意。
    第一、在批评了片面强调生产、不关心职工生活（增加工资太少）的偏向之后，有些同志多少又有点片面强调生活而不大注意生产的情况。如前面所说，今年国家所规定的增长工资的指标已经不能算低。从国家财政、物资供应以及工资的增长和劳动生产率的比例关系来看，已经达到了或者差不多达到了饱和点，可是这次工资增长指标下达以后，有许多地区和部门都要求再提高指标。有的单位新增加的数字竟超过了原来颁发的增长工资指标的一倍以上，这种现象，无论如何不能算是正常的。有些单位的领导干部存在着这样一种思想，即不管他们的劳动生产率计划、上缴利润计划和降低成本计划是否能够完成，先把工资增加上去，造成既成事实再说。这种想法和作法，就很可能造成将来生产管理和工资工作上的被动。
    第二、多少有些强调工资水平，忽视改进工资制度的情况。前面已经说过，今年增加工资较多，本来是改进工资制度的一个有利条件，但是这个有利条件如果运用得不好，就会降低工资改革的作用，有时甚至会发生一种反作用。下面是这种情况的两个例子：
    一个是属于工人升级方面的。在批判了过去有一个时期，对于工人的升级面控制得过严，造成工人升级太慢的错误之后，今年工人升级的工作，又发生了另外一种情况，就是不严格按照技术等级标准，更不问生产上是否需要，盲目升级的现象。在不少企业中，工人的升级面达到百分之七、八十，有的甚至达到百分之百。这样盲目地给工人升级的结果，浪费了工资基金，加大了产品的成本，打乱了企业中的劳动组织和定员制度，使工人的技术等级和工作等级不相适应，加重了高级工人干低级活的不合理现象，引起了工人内部的不团结，妨碍了计件工资制度的推广，增加了职工外调的困难，等等。
    另一个是属于工程技术人员和职员的工资方面的。根据国家社会主义工业化的需要和目前我国工程技术人员缺乏的情况，对于工程技术人员的工资比非工程技术人员的工资规定的高一些是必要的合理的。这个问题在实行职务工资制的方案的企业中，已经得到了比较合理的解决。因为在职务工资方案中，对于工程技术人员和财政经济工作人员的工资关系，已经作了比较适当的安排。问题是在于国家机关、事业单位和某些企业中，工程技术人员的工资标准不是按照他们的职务来规定，而是实行所谓“两条线”的办法，使工程技术人员和财经工作人员的工资关系，在这次工资改革中，不但没有得到改善，有的反而使原来的矛盾扩大化了。因此，就引起了国家机关、事业单位和某些企业里的财经工作人员的不满，在他们中间，流行着这样一些顺口溜：“男学工，女学医，学习财经没出息”；“千不怨，万不怨，只怨从前未进工学院”。
    以上这两个例子，就是片面地强调提高工资水平，忽视改进工资制度的思想和作法，给我们带来的不良后果。
    第三、多少有些重视增加工资，忽视政治思想教育的情况。在这里我想引用江西省委九月十五日的一个电报——“关于企业领导干部工资问题”——中的几句话，来说明一下：“有些地区有不少企业在这次工资改革中，对干部特别是领导干部的工资问题注意较多，而对工人的工资注意较少，大部分企业对国务院关于企业领导干部工资增长幅度一般不超过百分之二十的规定，未能严格遵守执行。根据测算结果，南昌市工业局所属二十一个工厂领导干部增加工资均超过百分之二十，一般都增加百分之四十以上，甚至有的增加到百分之一百至百分之二百，加上大部分干部都是打乱原工资等级重新评定，包括升级因素在内，一律从四月份起补发，一次要补发工资很多，这样挤占了工人的工资增长指标，引起工人的情绪波动。工资改革的作法，省里规定的步骤是先工人后干部，但许多单位工人与干部同时进行，有的单位在试套工人等级时，停下来评定干部的级别，有的单位领导上纠缠于干部工资问题，而放松了对工人的思想教育工作，以致工人中发生的一些思想问题得不到迅速的解决。”当然，领导干部在这样一种争取自己多增加工资的思想情绪支配之下，那里还有什么时间、情绪和心思去向工人进行政治思想教育工作呢？由于我们对于工资改革的政策宣传的不深、不透、不具体、不全面，以致今年虽然增长工资不少，但是，仍然有些工人有意见，说什么：“雷声大雨点小”，
  “光打雷不下雨”。其实，这种“雨点小”即少增或者是“不下雨”即不增的人的工资收入，和那些“下大雨”，即多增的人的工资收入比较起来还是多，而不是少，有的还多的很多。如果我们把这种实际情况，根据按劳取酬和同工同酬的原则，向职工解释清楚的话，工人对于上述政策会没有什么意见，也不应该有什么意见。又一次证明，在任何情况之下，作任何工作，如果忽视政治思想教育工作，就一定不能得到好的结果。
    希望各级党委加强对工资
            工作的领导
    工资同每一个职工及其家属都有着切身的利害关系，大家都很关心这个问题。如果我们不注意调查研究，不实事求是，不注意按劳取酬原则，不贯彻执行群众路线的方法，不采取稳步前进的方针，不加强政治思想教育工作，那么，在工资问题上比在其他各种问题上，更容易犯主观主义、官僚主义和本位主义的错误，更容易脱离群众。
    我们对于工资问题的情况的了解还很不够，工资工作的经验也很缺乏，因之，对于它的特点和它的发展规律都还没有很好地摸到。工资是当前国民经济各部门工作中的一个薄弱环节。在这个问题上，我们曾经犯过这样或那样的错误。如果不很好地总结过去，特别是这次工资改革工作的经验，那么，过去所犯过的错误还会重复。因此，我们希望各级党委加强对工资工作的领导，特别是作好这次工资改革的检查总结工作，借以克服工作中的这个薄弱环节，使我们的工资工作在这次工资改革的基础上能够向前推进一步，使工资在我国建设社会主义的伟大事业中，充分地发挥它的杠杆作用。
