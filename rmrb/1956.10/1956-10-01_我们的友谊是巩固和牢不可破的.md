    Our Friendship is Consolidated and Unbreakable
    Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Pankratova
    The People's Republic of China's millions upon millions of foreign friends are joyfully and warmly celebrating its seventh anniversary with it. Not long ago, in 1949, Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, announced the establishment the People's Republic of China, a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on a worker-peasant alliance. Two years ago, on October 1, 1954, the Chinese people enthusiastically celebrated the fifth anniversary of the People's Republic of China. These five years were filled with achievements and victories that are hard to imagine in such a short period. I was a witness and participant in the grand national celebration of this glorious anniversary. Millions upon millions of people—workers, peasants and intellectuals, the heroic Chinese army, and representatives of all strata of Chinese residents—paraded through the streets and squares of festive Beijing with flags and banners, wearing bright costumes, and holding flowers, not only expressing their joy and hailing the victory of the people's revolution, but also expressing their unwavering determination to carry their cause through to a victorious end. Two more years have passed. At the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, representing the army of more than 10 million Chinese Communists, a preliminary summary was made of the great achievements in the struggle to build a communist society. At this congress, representatives of fraternal communist and workers' parties, including the delegation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, heartily and joyfully congratulated the entire Chinese people, led by their long-tested leader, the Communist Party of China, on the great achievements in socialist transformation achieved in an extremely short period of time.
    Of course, as pointed out in almost all the speeches and statements at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people completed their great transformation in an international environment that was incomparably superior to that of the Soviet Union at the time. We Soviet people had to wage the struggle for the victory of socialism alone under conditions of imperialist encirclement, when imperialist elements used various methods to sabotage or hinder socialist construction. Now the Chinese people are building their own socialist society in a different situation. The Chinese people have the fraternal assistance and support of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries in realizing their great transformation.
    The great Chinese people have not only shown the world their fighting ability, but also their admirable ability to work. The great Chinese people are not only filled with justifiable national pride, but also with a deep spirit of internationalism.
    The Soviet people and the working people of all the people's democratic countries are sincerely and enthusiastically happy for the achievements made by the fraternal Chinese people, and believe that this is a common achievement of the entire socialist camp, and that the victory of democracy and socialism and the victory of world peace will depend on the consolidation and rapid development of these achievements.
    In order to continue to strengthen our friendship, all of us Soviet people are determined to do everything necessary to help our dear Chinese brothers develop and consolidate the national economy and develop science, culture and art with our ordinary labor.
    Now each of us regards the completion of any task for the Chinese people as our duty and supreme honor. We now and in the future will complete this task with great desire and enthusiasm.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on behalf of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the entire Soviet people, sent a congratulatory message to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, saying:
  "The historically significant victory of the People's Republic of China has greatly excited the Soviet working people, and made them proud to have such a friend and brother as the great Chinese people. We believe that the fraternal friendship between the people of our two countries is a guarantee for further strengthening the power of the world socialist system and consolidating lasting peace in the world."
    The Soviet people heartily congratulate the working people of the People's Republic of China on your great festival—the seventh anniversary of the victorious development of the People's Republic of China, and extend our fraternal greetings to you. In this congratulatory voice of millions of Soviet people, I would also like to add my personal heartfelt congratulations, because after my visit to China, I established friendly and sincere relations with many representatives of Chinese intellectuals, especially with those Chinese scientists who enthusiastically contribute their knowledge and ability to the victory of Chinese socialism and the lasting victory of world peace and progress.
    Long live our unbreakable friendship, the guarantee of the victory of our great common cause!

    我们的友谊是巩固和牢不可破的
    苏联科学院院士　潘克拉托娃
    中华人民共和国国外千千万万的朋友同它一起愉快而热烈地纪念它成立的七周年纪念日。不久以前，在1949年，中国人民的领袖毛泽东宣布了工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的中华人民共和国的成立。两年以前，1954年，10月1日，中国人民热烈地庆祝了中华人民共和国五周年纪念日。这五年充满了在这么短的时期内难以想像的成就和胜利。我是在这个光荣周年纪念日全民盛大庆祝的见证人和参加者。千千万万的人——工人，农民和知识分子、英勇的中国军队以及中国各阶层居民的代表——打着旗帜和标语牌，穿着鲜艳的服装，手里拿着花，无尽的潮流般地在节日北京的街道和广场上游行，不仅表示自己的喜悦，欢呼人民革命的胜利，而且也表示把自己的事业胜利地进行到底的坚定不移的决心。又过了两年。在代表中国一千多万共产党人大军的中国共产党第八次全国代表大会上，对于在建设共产主义社会斗争中的伟大成就作了初步总结。在这次代表大会上，兄弟共产党和工人党的代表，其中包括苏联共产党的代表团，衷心愉快地祝贺以久经考验的领导者——中国共产党为首的中国全体人民在极短期间内达到的社会主义改造方面的伟大成就。
    当然，正像在中国共产党第八次全国代表大会上差不多所有的讲话和发言中所指出的，中国人民在比苏联当时无比优越的国际环境中完成了自己的伟大改造工作。我们苏联人不得不在帝国主义包围的条件下单独地进行争取社会主义胜利的斗争，当时帝国主义分子采用各种方法破坏或阻碍社会主义建设。现在中国人民建设自己的社会主义社会是处在另外一种情况下。中国人民在实现伟大的改造中有着苏联和各人民民主国家各方面的兄弟般的援助和支持。
    伟大的中国人民不仅向全世界表明了他们的战斗能力，而且也向全世界表明了令人赞扬的劳动能力。伟大的中国人民不仅充满了合理的民族自豪感，而且也充满了深刻的国际主义精神。
    苏联人民和所有的人民民主国家的劳动人民都真诚和热情地为兄弟般的中国人民所取得的成就而高兴，认为这是整个社会主义阵营的共同成就，而民主和社会主义的胜利以及世界和平的胜利将决定于这些成就的巩固和迅速。
    为了继续加强我们的友谊，我们全体苏联人民决心作好一切必要作的事，用自己平凡的劳动援助我们亲爱的中国兄弟发展和巩固民族经济，发展科学、文化和艺术。
    现在我们每一个人都把为中国人民完成任何一项任务看作是自己的职责和无上的光荣。我们现在和将来都以极大的愿望和热忱来完成这项任务。
    苏联共产党中央委员会代表苏联共产党和全苏联人民向中国共产党第八次全国代表大会致贺词说：
  “中华人民共和国的具有历史意义的胜利，使苏联劳动人民非常兴奋，使他们因为有伟大的中国人民这样一个朋友和兄弟而感到骄傲。我们认为，我们两国人民的兄弟般的友谊，是进一步加强世界社会主义体系威力的保证，是巩固世界持久和平的保证。”
    苏联人民向中华人民共和国劳动人民衷心地祝贺你们的伟大节日——中华人民共和国胜利发展的七周年纪念日，并向你们致以兄弟般的敬礼。在千百万苏联人的这个祝贺声中我也要加上我个人的衷心祝贺，因为在我访问中国以后，我同中国知识分子中的许多代表人物，特别是同那些为了中国社会主义的胜利以及世界和平和进步事业的持久胜利而热情地贡献出自己的知识和能力的中国科学家们，建立了友好和诚挚的关系。
    我们伟大的共同事业胜利的保证——我们牢不可破的友谊万岁！
