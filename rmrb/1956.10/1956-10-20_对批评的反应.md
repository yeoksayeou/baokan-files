Response to Criticism

The criticism in the article "We Are Still Waiting for a Reply" on page four of the July 24th People's Daily, regarding our handling of Wang Hongwen's accusation letter, is completely correct. Our forwarding of the accusation letter to the accused and then, upon receiving the accused's reply, forwarding the original text to the newspaper without analysis was irresponsible and unserious. To change this situation, we plan to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the handling of people's letters and visits throughout the county and establish necessary regulations. Regarding Wang Hongwen's issue, we have also reorganized our efforts and conducted investigations among the local people.

According to the investigation, Wang Hongwen had his probationary period extended due to reasons such as arrogance, complacency, and detachment from the masses. After the extension of the probationary period, he not only failed to correct his mistakes but also committed errors such as failing to implement Party resolutions and distorting Party policies. Therefore, upon a resolution by the branch general meeting and approval by the district committee, his probationary Party member status was revoked. The township branch secretary, Zhai Yutian, did not engage in retaliatory behavior against him. Therefore, we believe the original handling was correct.

However, township branch secretary Zhai Yutian did indeed have errors of encroaching on the fruits of land reform and serious arrogance and complacency.

    对批评的反应
    7月24日人民日报四版“我们还等着答复”一文，对我们处理王鸿文的控告信的情况提出的批评，是完全正确的。我们把控告信转给了被控告的人，在收到被控告人的答复后，又不加分析地把原文照转给报社，是不负责和不严肃的。为了改变这种情况，我们准备在全县范围内，对人民来信来访工作进行一次全面检查，并建立必要的制度。对王鸿文的问题，我们也重新组织力量，到当地群众中去作了调查。
    根据调查，王鸿文曾因骄傲自满，脱离群众等原因被延长过预备期。延长预备期后，他不但没有改正错误，反而又犯了不执行党的决议、歪曲党的政策等错误，因此经支部大会决议，区委批准取消了他的预备党员资格，乡支部书记翟玉田对他并没有打击报复行为。因此，我们认为原来的处理是对的。
    但是，乡支部书记翟玉田也确实有过侵占土地改革胜利果实、严重的骄傲自满的错误。
