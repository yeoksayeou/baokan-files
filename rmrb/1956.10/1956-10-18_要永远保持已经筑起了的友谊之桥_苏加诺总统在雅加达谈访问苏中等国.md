Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 17th: President Sukarno and his entourage returned here on the 16th. Tens of thousands of people who had been waiting around the airport for several hours enthusiastically cheered the President's return after a fifty-day visit to the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Mongolia, and China.

Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo and Speaker of Parliament Sardjono went to the plane to greet President Sukarno. Among the officials who welcomed him at the airport were ministers, members of parliament, chiefs of staff of the army, navy, and air force, and foreign envoys stationed in Jakarta.

In a brief speech at the airport, the President said that his visits to the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries were to achieve the same task as his visits to the United States and Western Europe, namely to serve the interests of the country in international relations.

He said: "I can say that, both from the people in the governments we visited and from the people of the countries we visited, our worldview—our Pancasila, our foreign policy—a policy of independence and activity, has been fully understood and respected."

"In Moscow, in Belgrade, in Vienna, in Prague, in Ulaanbaatar, and in Beijing, we had the opportunity to talk with the heads of state, government leaders, and social leaders of these countries." He said that although ideologies differ, many commonalities can be found between them. He said this is because of the common desire to achieve a just and prosperous society, the strong desire to establish friendly relations, and mutual respect for each other's ideologies. He also said that this is also due to a common desire for peace.

The President said that during his visit abroad, a bridge of friendship had been built, which should be maintained forever.

The crowds standing at the airport and along the road from the airport to the Independence Palace were very dense. The flags they carried read: "Long live the friendship between Indonesia and the Soviet Union!" "Long live the friendship between Indonesia and China!" "Long live the National United Front!" "Long live Bung Karno!"

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 17th: The Indonesian "People's Daily" reported today that President Sukarno told reporters accompanying him on his way back home on October 16 that in the people's democratic countries, he saw the realization of the ideals he had held since 1929.

The President said that in China, he saw the practice of guided democracy. He also said that only guided democracy can lead the people into a new world of true justice and prosperity.

The President continued that in order to build Indonesia, it is very necessary to inspire the people with ideals and let them know the goals of their efforts. Without a clear goal, it is impossible to mobilize the people for construction. For example, in China, people are working enthusiastically because they know they are building a socialist society—a society without exploitation.

Someone asked if it was correct to say that after signing the Soviet-Indonesian joint statement, Indonesia had violated its independent policy. The President simply replied: "No."

    要永远保持已经筑起了的友谊之桥
    苏加诺总统在雅加达谈访问苏中等国
    新华社雅加达17日电　苏加诺总统和他的随行人员在16日回到这里。在机场周围等待了几小时的几万群众热烈地欢呼总统在苏联、南斯拉夫、奥地利、捷克斯洛伐克、蒙古、中国作了五十天的访问后归来。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理和沙多诺议长到机旁去迎接苏加诺总统。到机场欢迎的官员中有部长们、议员们、陆海空三军的参谋长们和驻雅加达的外交使节。
    总统在机场上发表的简短演说中说，他对苏联、中国和人民民主国家的访问是为了要实现跟他访问美国和西欧相同的任务，就是为国家在国际关系中的利益服务。
    他说：“我可以说，不论是从我们所访问的政府的人士，不论是从我们所访问的国家的人民，我们的人生观——我们的潘查希拉、我们的外交政策——独立而积极的政策都得到了充分的了解和尊重”。
    “在莫斯科，在贝尔格莱德，在维也纳，在布拉格，在乌兰巴托和在北京，我们有机会同这些国家的国家元首、政府领袖和社会领袖进行谈话”。他说，虽然意识形态不同，但是彼此之间都能找到许多共同之点。他说，这是因为有着实现公正和繁荣社会的理想的共同愿望，是由于有着建立友好关系的强烈愿望和互相尊重彼此的意识形态的缘故。他又说，这也是由于对和平的共同愿望的缘故。
    总统说，在他访问外国期间，已经筑起了友谊之桥，这是应该永远加以保持的。
    站在飞机场上和站在从飞机场到独立宫的道路的两旁的人群十分拥挤。他们拿的旗帜上写着：“印度尼西亚和苏联之间的友谊万岁！”“印度尼西亚和中国之间的友谊万岁！”“全国统一战线万岁！”“朋加诺万岁！”。
    新华社雅加达17日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”今天报道，苏加诺总统10月16日在回国途中对随行记者说，在人民民主国家，他看到了他从1929年以来所怀抱的理想的实现。
    总统说，在中国，他看到了有领导的民主的实践。他又说，只有有领导的民主才能引导人民进入真正的公正和繁荣的新世界。
    总统继续说，为了建设印度尼西亚，很有必要用理想来鼓舞人民，让他们知道他们努力的目标。如果没有明确的目标，那就不可能动员人民从事建设。例如在中国，人民都在热情地工作，因为他们知道他们是在建设社会主义社会——一个没有剥削的社会。
    有人问道，这样说是否正确：在签署了苏联—印度尼西亚联合声明以后，印度尼西亚已经违背了它的独立政策。总统简单地回答说：“不”。
