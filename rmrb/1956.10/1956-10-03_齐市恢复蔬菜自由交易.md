    Qiqihar City Restores Free Trade in Vegetables
    (Our dispatch) The Qiqihar Vegetable Company, starting from September 20th, changed its operating method of monopolizing the purchase and sale of vegetables, and restored free market transactions. At the same time, it vigorously organizes direct meetings between producers and sellers, and direct transportation. According to production and sales conditions, a vegetable production cooperative can sign contracts with several sales units; a sales unit can also sign contracts with several vegetable production cooperatives. Buyers and sellers weigh and measure by themselves, and settle accounts by themselves. After the restoration of free transactions, the price of vegetables will be reduced due to the reduction of circulation links between production and sales.
    It has now been decided to add three farmers' trade markets in the suburbs of Qiqihar City. Vegetables grown by agricultural cooperatives, members, and individual farmers can be brought to the market for free trade, and consumers can freely purchase them in the market. (Zhang Lianbi)

    齐市恢复蔬菜自由交易
    本报讯　齐齐哈尔市蔬菜公司从9月20日起，改变对蔬菜的包买包卖的经营形式，恢复市场自由成交。同时大力组织产、销直接见面，直线运输。根据生产和销售情况，一个蔬菜生产社可以和几个销售单位签订合同；一个销售单位也可以和几个蔬菜生产社签订合同。买卖双方自行拣斤过秤，自行结算。恢复自由成交后，由于减少了产销之间的流转环节，蔬菜价格将降低。
    现已决定在齐齐哈尔市近郊增设三处农民贸易市场，农业社、社员和个体农民所种的蔬菜，都可以拿到市场上来自由交易，消费者可以到市场上自由选购。（张连璧）
