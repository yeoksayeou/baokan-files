A new starting point
By our reporter

The people's capital, Beijing, began its National Day military parade and procession in pouring rain. An endless stream of people, holding countless red flags, lined up in magnificent formations, and marched with vigorous steps, grandly advancing before Tiananmen. Seven years ago, the victorious people celebrated the birth of New China here; today, they are here again, celebrating the great victory already achieved in the national socialist revolution with universal joy, and celebrating the success of the Chinese Communist Party's Eighth National Congress, which has great historical significance. This congress summarized the revolutionary experience of the past eleven years, put forward the fighting program of the Second Five-Year Plan to the people of the whole country, and is an important milestone in the socialist process of our people. Today's parade is the beginning of this new great starting point.

When Chairman Mao and other party and state leaders, as well as Indonesian President Sukarno and Nepalese Prime Minister Acharya, who came to visit our country, appeared on the reviewing stand, warm cheers and applause resounded continuously across the square.

The review began. Millions of eyes turned to the ranks of the heroic and invincible People's Army. This is a steel-like force, a victorious force. They once paved the way for the people to embark on the road to socialism. Today's review once again convincingly shows that they have achieved remarkable achievements in training, and they are a powerful force for defending the peaceful construction of the motherland.

The workers' contingent, led by four huge golden characters "Beijing Workers," came through, and countless production charts and various models appeared in a flurry of rain... The workers, their faces streaming with water, held these charts high, passed through Tiananmen Square, and a burst of grateful applause rang out in the square. The cordial voice of "Salute to the worker comrades" came from Tiananmen...

People watched the workers' contingent marching in the rain with the most admiration and affection. Steelworkers and power plant workers from Shijingshan, young female workers from spinning and weaving workshops, and advanced producers wearing various golden badges on their chests. Xu Shenggui, a representative attending the National Congress of Advanced Producers, led 600 advanced producers from Beijing No. 2 Cotton Mill, walking at the forefront of the factory's contingent, followed by a long line of more than 3,000 workers. Xu Shenggui and the 27th work zone of the weaving workshop he led are at the forefront of production as they are in the parade. One of the shifts in the 27th work zone has not produced a single second-class cloth for a month, the attendance rate has reached 100%, and the savings have been great. The convening of the Party's Eighth National Congress brought great encouragement to Xu Shenggui and his partners. More than 90 outstanding workers in the factory gloriously joined the Party during the conference. Textile worker Zhao Shumin was so happy that she shed tears when she learned that she had been gloriously approved to join the Party during the "Eighth Congress," and immediately went to buy a new Party constitution to study. She said that she would demand herself with the new level of Party members put forward by the "Eighth Congress." Zhao Shumin is now walking excitedly in the parade with her sisters in the factory. The heavy rain is pouring on her, soaking all her clothes, but her heart is full of excitement and gratitude, waving tirelessly to Tiananmen.

How much wealth and glory have these tens of thousands of hands, waving in the rain with love of labor, added to our motherland! Look, the Liberation-brand cars are coming, the domestically-made jet plane models are coming, the 12,000-kilowatt turbine generator model is coming, the Peace-type new steam locomotive model is coming... Are not all these achievements in just seven years worth being proud of? However, people remember Chairman Mao's teaching in the opening speech of the "Eighth Congress": "Modesty helps one to progress, pride makes one lag behind." At this new starting point of the high tide of socialist construction in the motherland, what excites people is not the achievements of the past, but the more arduous tasks in the future. The Party's "Eighth Congress" has already outlined a grand vision of the Second Five-Year Plan for the people of the whole country. What lies before the people is not only to overfulfill and complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, but also to immediately prepare for the Second Five-Year Plan. We must move forward non-stop!...

The farmers' contingent from the suburbs of the capital walked almost shoulder to shoulder with the workers. The rainwater washed the huge cabbages, cotton, and red, green, and colorful melon and fruit models in the ranks, making them look particularly fresh and lovely. Twenty-nine large agricultural cooperatives with more than 1,000 households have now been established in the suburbs of the capital, and they have recently completed long-term planning work. They will comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, turn abandoned kilns and depressions into fish ponds, turn barren slopes into orchards, and turn field ridges into arable land. The Peace Agricultural Cooperative can increase arable land by 1,000 mu by removing the ridges and mounds on the edges of the fields. The 2,040 mu of wasteland in the Xiaotun Agricultural Cooperative can be used to plant fruit trees on 400 mu and trees on 700 mu. The 2,000 mu of wasteland in the Yongfeng Agricultural Cooperative can all be turned into fertile land by 1967... These long-term plans are not beautiful fantasies, but a portrayal of real life tomorrow. How broad a world has cooperation opened up for people's lives! Liu Rong, secretary of the Party Branch of the Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative in the eastern suburbs, told reporters: Although their large cooperative of more than 1,700 households suffered from floods this year, grain production still increased by 14% compared to last year. Last year, the average yield per mu was 334 jin, and this year it was 383 jin. More than 90% of the members have increased their income. Today, he personally led the members to the city in the middle of the night to participate in the parade, regardless of the heavy rain. They want to tell the beloved Party about their achievements and future plans.

When huge cloisonné porcelain vases, large ivory carvings, jade carvings... appeared in the parade, people applauded the handicraftsmen of the capital who were organized to participate in the National Day parade for the first time. People also applauded the ranks of industrialists and businessmen. The private industrialists and businessmen in the capital took the lead in embarking on the road of full public-private partnership this spring, promoting the transformation of private industry and commerce throughout the country. Today, they use various charts to illustrate that enterprise production has developed rapidly after the public-private partnership.

Rainwater splashed under people's feet, and the voices of people shouting "Long live" like spring thunder reverberated over Tiananmen Square. The parade contingent of students from the capital came grandly. The students were all soaked by the heavy rain, but their emotions were even higher. They wiped the rain off their faces and held high the large slogan "Marching towards science." They will not only work hard to learn the advanced science and technology of various countries, but also strive to explore our nation's cultural heritage. Students from the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine held up huge portraits of ancient Chinese famous doctors such as Li Shizhen and Hua Tuo.

Waves of gongs and drums and beautiful folk orchestral music came from afar. This is the parade contingent composed of the capital's literary and art circles. Look, a huge, budding lotus flower bloomed in front of Tiananmen, and in front of the lotus flower were the four huge golden characters "Let a hundred flowers bloom." Then, a large flower bed appeared, which was composed of various flowers by the girls. The hundreds of flowers swayed in the rain, appearing more lush and vibrant. Pairs of huge colored paper butterflies danced and collected honey on the flower bed, symbolizing the prosperity of "Let a hundred flowers bloom" in China's literary and art circles.

The sports team passed by. The masses around Tiananmen Square rushed to the Jinshui Bridge to cheer for Chairman Mao, President Sukarno, Prime Minister Acharya, and distinguished guests from various countries. The meeting ended, and applause from the stage and off the stage merged into one, and the feelings of friendship and peace were intertwined...

    新的起点
    本报记者
    人民的京城，在大雨滂沱中开始了国庆节的阅兵和游行。无穷无尽的人流，举着数不清的红旗，排列着雄壮的队伍，迈着矫健的脚步，在天安门前浩浩荡荡地前进着。七年前，胜利的人民在这里庆祝新中国的诞生；今天又在这里，万众欢腾地庆祝全国社会主义革命已经取得的伟大胜利，庆祝具有伟大历史意义的中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的成功。这次大会，总结了过去十一年的革命经验，向全国人民提出了第二个五年计划的奋斗纲领，是我国人民向社会主义进程的重要里程碑。而今天的游行，正是这一新的伟大起点的开始。
    当着以毛主席为首的党和国家的领导人员，以及前来我国访问的印度尼西亚共和国苏加诺总统、尼泊尔王国阿查里雅首相出现在检阅台上的时候，广场上不断响起热烈的欢呼和掌声。
    检阅开始了。千万双眼睛向着英雄无敌的人民军队的行列。这是钢铁的队伍，是常胜的队伍。他们过去曾为人民开辟了走向社会主义的大道，今天的检阅，又再次令人信服地表明了他们在训练中获得了卓越成就，他们是保卫祖国和平建设的强大力量。
    以“北京工人”四个巨大金字为前导的工人队伍，冒着雨过来了，在一片急雨里出现了无数的生产图表，各式各样的模型，……水流满脸的工人们把这些图表举得高高的，走过天安门广场，广场上响起了一片感激的掌声，从天安门上传来了“向工人同志们致敬”的亲切的声音……
    人们用最敬佩和亲切的眼光看着在雨中行进的工人队伍。来自石景山的炼钢工和发电工，来自细纱间和织布间的年青女工，胸口佩挂着各种金色徽章的先进生产者。北京国棉二厂的六百个先进生产者由出席全国先进生产者代表会议的代表徐生贵带头，走在全厂队伍的最前面，跟在后边的是三千多工人的漫长队伍。徐生贵和他所领导的织布间第二十七工区，在生产上也和游行时一样，是走在最前列的。二十七工区的一个班最近有一个月没有出一匹次布，出勤率达到了100％，节约成绩也很大。党的八次代表大会的召开，给徐生贵和他的伙伴带来了极大的鼓舞，全厂有九十多个优秀工人就在大会进行期间光荣地加入了党。纺织女工赵淑敏，当知道她正巧在“八大”召开期间被光荣批准入党，高兴得流下泪来，立即赶去买了一本新的党章来学习。她说她要以“八大”所提出来党员的新的水平来要求自己。赵淑敏现在和本厂的姐妹们一起在游行的行列里兴奋地走着，大雨不息地朝身上浇来，湿透了她所有的衣衫，但她的心里充满着兴奋、感激的热情，不知疲倦地向天安门挥着手。
    这成千上万双在雨中挥动着的热爱劳动的手，给我们祖国增加了多少财富，多少荣耀呵！请看，解放牌的汽车过来了，自制喷气式飞机模型过来了，一万二千瓩汽轮发电机模型过来了，和平型新式蒸汽机车模型过来了，……短短七年来的这一切成就，难道不值得骄傲吗？但是，人们记住毛主席在“八大”开幕词上的教导：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”，在这祖国社会主义建设高潮的新起点，激动人们心头的不是过去的成就，而是今后更加艰巨的任务，党的“八大”已经给全国人民勾画出了第二个五年计划的宏伟的远景，摆在人们面前的已不只是要超额提前完成第一个五年计划，而且立刻就要进行第二个五年计划的准备，必须一刻不停地前进呵！……
    首都郊区的农民队伍几乎是和工人们并肩走过来的，雨水把行列中的巨大白菜、棉花和红红绿绿的瓜果模型，冲洗得分外新鲜可爱了。首都郊区现在已建立了二十九个一千户以上的大型农业社，并且在最近已经完成了远景的规划工作，他们要全面地发展农、林、牧业，把废窑和洼地变成养鱼池，把荒坡变成果园，把田埂变成耕地。和平农业社取消田边的地埂土丘，可以增加耕地一千亩。小屯农业社的二千零四十亩荒地，有四百亩可以种果树，七百亩可种植树木，永丰农业社的二千亩荒地到1967年全部可以变为良田，……这些远景规划不是美丽的幻想，而是明天真实生活的写照。合作化给人们的生活开辟了多么宽阔的天地呵！东郊星火农业社的党总支书记刘荣对记者说：他们这个一千七百多户的大社，今年虽然遭受了水灾，但粮食产量仍比去年增产14％，去年每亩平均收三百三十四斤，今年收了三百八十三斤，90％以上的社员都增加了收入。今天，他亲自带着社员们不顾大雨滂沱，深夜就动身赶到城里来参加游行，他们要把自己所取得的成绩和今后的打算，告诉给亲爱的党。
    当游行队伍里出现了巨大的景泰蓝瓷瓶、大象牙雕刻、玉石雕刻……人们向组织起来第一次参加国庆游行的首都手工业者鼓掌。人们也向工商业者的队伍鼓掌，首都的私营工商业者在今年春天最先走上了全部公私合营的道路，推动了全国私营工商业的改造。今天他们用各种图表说明公私合营以后企业生产都飞速地发展了。
    雨水在人们的脚下飞溅着，人们像春雷一般欢呼“万岁”的声音，荡漾在天安门的上空，首都学生的游行队伍浩浩荡荡地过来了。同学们都被大雨浇湿了，但是，他们的情绪却更加高涨，他们用手抹一把脸上的雨水，高举着向科学进军的大字语牌。他们不仅要努力学习世界各国的先进科学技术，而且还在努力发掘我们民族的文化遗产。中医学院的学生们高举着我国古代名医李时珍、华陀等人的巨幅画像。
    阵阵锣鼓声和优美的民间管弦乐声，由远而近，这是首都文艺界组成的游行队伍。看吧，一枝巨大的含苞待放的荷花，在天安门前开放了，在荷花的前面是“百花齐放”四个巨大的金字。随着，又出现了一个大花坛，这是姑娘们用各种花朵组成的，百花在雨中摇曳着，显得更加茂盛和鲜艳。一双双一对对巨大的彩色纸蝴蝶在花坛上飞舞采蜜，它象征着我国文艺界“百花齐放”的繁荣景象。
    体育大队过去了。天安门广场周围的群众，涌向金水桥头，向毛主席、向苏加诺总统、向阿查里雅首相和来自各国的贵宾们欢呼。散会了，台上和台下的掌声响成一片，友谊、和平的感情交织在一起。……
