    Man-made Disaster
    The rice harvesting season has arrived, and the vast number of farmers are reaping the fruits of a year's labor with the joy of a good harvest. However, the "Lukou" Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Dushan Township, Echeng County, Hubei Province, has suffered a man-made disaster this year.
    During the spring plowing and sowing season this year, the Echeng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions for "Indica rice to be changed to Japonica, single crop to be changed to double crop." The Dushan Township Party Branch, based on the county and district committee's promotion of Japonica rice, convened a meeting of the township's agricultural cooperative directors to assign tasks, forcibly ordering the Lukou Cooperative to switch to planting 1,300 mu of Japonica rice. Furthermore, it was announced: within three days, the "Victory Indica" rice seeds must be sent to the grain store to be exchanged for early Japonica. After the cooperative director returned to the cooperative, he announced this task at an emergency cooperative committee meeting. The cooperative committee members present were shocked to hear this. Cooperative committee member Yang Haiqing said, "Rice seeds that have never been planted before, planting so much for the first time, who will be responsible if production is reduced!" Deputy Director Hu Tongshu said, "Our cooperative has few people and a lot of land, and we are already too busy, how can we plant so much double-cropping rice!"
    Director Qin, seeing that most of the cooperative committee members disagreed, felt both anxious and frustrated, and adopted a combination of "mobilization and coercion" to arrange the tasks. After the Lukou Cooperative accepted this task, more than fifty cooperative members used more than twenty small boats to transport the Victory Indica rice seeds to the Fankou Grain Store, thirty li away, and then carried back the early Japonica rice seeds from the grain store.
    The entire cooperative completed the task of planting 1,460 mu of early Japonica.
    The characteristic of early Japonica rice is that it requires a lot of fertilizer, but the cooperative lacks fertilizer sources, and most of the fields lack sufficient fertilizer, coupled with poor management, resulting in a serious reduction in production. The average yield per mu was 161 jin, which is more than 480 jin less per mu than the Victory Indica under the same conditions. Due to this loss, the cooperative harvested more than 470,000 jin less rice than last year, and it is estimated that about 30% of the cooperative members will have reduced income compared to last year.　Yu Shufu

    人为的灾害
    稻谷收割季节到来了，广大农民怀着丰收喜悦的心情，收割一年劳动的果实。可是湖北鄂城县杜山乡“路口”高级农业社，今年却遭受了人为的灾害。
    今年春耕播种的季节，中共鄂城县委会发出了“籼改粳，单改双”的指示。杜山乡党支部根据县、区委推广粳稻的要求，召开了全乡农业社主任会议分配任务，硬叫路口社改种粳稻一千三百亩。并且宣布：限三天把“胜利籼”谷种送到粮店，换回早粳。社主任回社后，在紧急社委会上宣布了这个任务。参加会的社委一听大吃一惊。社委杨海青说：“从来没种过的谷种，头一次种这么多，减了产归那个负责！”副主任胡同树说：“我们社里人少田地多，现时都忙不过来，那能种这么多双季稻！”
    秦主任见到大多数社委不同意，心里又急又闷，就采取“动员与强迫”相结合的方法布置了任务。路口社接受了这个任务以后，五十多个社员划着二十多只小船，把胜利籼谷种运到相离三十里的樊口粮店，又从粮店里搬回早粳谷种。
    全社共完成了一千四百六十亩早粳的任务。
    早粳稻的特点是需要肥料很多，但是这个社肥源缺乏，大部分田肥料不足，加以管理不好，因此造成严重减产。平均亩产一百六十一斤，比同样条件的胜利籼每亩少收四百八十多斤。这个社由于这项损失，比去年少收四十七万多斤稻谷，预计将有30％左右的社员因此比去年减少收入。　余书福
