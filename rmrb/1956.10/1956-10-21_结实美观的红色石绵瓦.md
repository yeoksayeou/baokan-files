    Sturdy and Beautiful Red Asbestos Tiles
    (Our dispatch) Jilin Asbestos Tile Factory used "ferric oxide red" and cement as raw materials to trial-produce red asbestos tiles. More than 600 red tiles were trial-produced in July and have all been sold. According to users, this asbestos tile is both strong and beautiful. Now, many units are requesting orders from the asbestos tile factory.
    If this factory mass-produces this kind of red asbestos tile, it can save the country 4,000 tons of cement a year.

    结实美观的红色石绵瓦
    本报讯　吉林石绵瓦厂用“铁铅氧石土红”和水泥混合作原料，试制成了红色石绵瓦。7月份试制出来六百多张红色瓦，已经全部卖出，据用户反映，这种石绵瓦既结实又美观。现在，有很多单位都向石绵瓦厂要求订货。
    这个厂如果大量生产这种红色石绵瓦，一年就可以给国家节约四千吨水泥。
