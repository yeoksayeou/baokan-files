Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 26th - The Enshi Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hubei Province held an enlarged cadre meeting in mid-October and decided to take effective measures to solve the problems existing in the current development of diversified economy and sideline production.

Mountainous agricultural cooperatives in Enshi have already made some achievements in developing diversified economy and sideline production. However, due to excessive emphasis on centralized unification, members' household sideline occupations were hardly carried out. In addition, improper allocation of labor by the agricultural cooperatives often led to conflicts between agriculture and sideline occupations. As a result, the development of sideline production in the entire region was unsatisfactory. In response to this situation, the meeting, after research, determined that: Fixed and perennial large-scale sideline occupations or large workshops such as lime factories and sulfur burning should be collectively operated by agricultural cooperatives; temporary sideline occupations should all be managed by production teams; and sporadic long-term sideline occupations such as raising poultry and livestock should be managed by the members themselves. The sideline income of the cooperatives should be distributed uniformly by the cooperatives, the sideline income of the teams should be distributed by the teams, and all the income from the members' household sideline occupations should belong to the members themselves. Handicraft workers can independently establish handicraft groups within the agricultural cooperative, responsible for their own profits and losses and contributing to the public accumulation fund; they can also be assessed by the cooperative and implement quota-based remuneration, but the remuneration for handicraft labor should generally be slightly higher than that for agriculture. The meeting also emphasized that in carrying out sideline production, it is necessary to implement the system of fixed quotas, contracting, and rewarding for exceeding quotas, in order to enhance the production enthusiasm of the members.

Regarding the issue of members engaging in household sideline production, the meeting pointed out that each agricultural cooperative must make specific arrangements for operating time and operating channels, and provide specific assistance to those with difficulties. The meeting required each agricultural cooperative to give members at least five or six days a month to engage in household sideline occupations. In addition to mobilizing members to raise poultry and livestock, members can also be mobilized to contract small tasks from the cooperative, or the cooperative can contract work from outside and distribute it to the members.

In order to strengthen the leadership of diversified economy and sideline production in the whole region, the meeting determined that the prefecture and county must effectively strengthen the work of the diversified economy office. Cadres in the county-level animal husbandry, forestry, special products, and economic crop departments must be fully staffed. Districts, townships, cooperatives, and production teams should all have designated personnel responsible for leading sideline production.

    恩施专区安排今冬副业生产
    采取措施解决副业生产过分集中问题
    新华社武汉26日电　中共湖北省恩施地方委员会在10月中旬召开干部扩大会议，决定采取有效措施，解决当前开展多种经营和副业生产中存在的问题。
    恩施山区农业社在发展多种经营和副业生产上，已经取得了一些成绩。但是由于过分地强调集中统一，社员家庭副业几乎没有搞，再加上农业社在劳力上调配不当，农业与副业经常发生矛盾，结果全区副业生产开展得不能令人满意。针对这种情况，会议经过研究以后确定：凡属固定性常年的大宗副业或大型场坊如石灰厂、烧硫磺等，由农业社集体经营；凡属临时性的副业全部交生产队经营；零星的长期的家禽家畜饲养等副业，由社员自己经营。社的副业收入由社统一分配，队的副业收入由队分配，社员家庭副业收入全部归社员自己。手工业者可在农业合作社内单独成立手工业小组，自负盈亏，提公积金；也可由社计分，实行定额计酬，但手工业劳动报酬一般应稍高于农业。会议还强调在开展副业生产中，必须贯彻执行定额包干超额奖励的制度，以提高社员的生产积极性。
    对于社员开展家庭副业生产问题，会议指出，各农业社在经营时间和经营门路上，必须加以具体安排，有困难的要给以具体帮助。会议要求每个农业社每月至少给社员五六天的时间搞家庭副业，在门路上除发动社员饲养家禽家畜外，还可发动社员向社里承包小活，也可由社里向外面承包活路，分给社员。
    为了加强领导全区多种经营和副业生产，会议确定专区和县必须切实加强多种经营办公室的工作，县级畜牧、林业、特产、经济作物等部门的干部必须配齐，区、乡、社和生产队都应设有专人负责领导副业生产。
