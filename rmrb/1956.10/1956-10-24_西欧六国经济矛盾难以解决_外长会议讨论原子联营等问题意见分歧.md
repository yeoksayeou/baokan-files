Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd, Moscow dispatch: According to TASS, Paris, October 22nd: The foreign ministers of the six Western European countries participating in the European Coal and Steel Community—France, West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Italy—held a meeting in Paris on October 20th and 21st to discuss the establishment of a so-called "European Atomic Energy Community" and the creation of a common market.

    From newspaper reports, it is evident that the meeting participants displayed serious differences of opinion on these two issues. For example, during discussions on establishing the "European Atomic Energy Community," West Germany, which has a strong interest in using atomic energy for military purposes, suggested that private companies could participate in discussions on atomic energy issues alongside the proposed Western European "Atomic Energy Community." This is essentially a rejection of supervision over the use of atomic energy. French Foreign Minister Pineau and other participants in the meeting demanded that the "Atomic Energy Community" be given full authority to monopolize and control fissile materials. No agreement was reached on this issue.

    During discussions on establishing a common market, France opposed West Germany's plan to reduce tariffs. France stated that it could not eliminate tariff barriers in a short period because domestic prices in France were higher than in other countries. Pineau explained that this was because France had high expenditures on "social needs." However, Radio Paris pointed out that this was largely due to the enormous expenses France was incurring in military operations in Algeria. In this regard, the meeting also discussed the coordination of social welfare expenditures among the six countries. According to Agence France-Presse, the West German delegation stated that West Germany could not agree to shorten the workweek and increase wages, as West Germany would "not create threats to its own economic structure."

    The meeting was interrupted several times in an attempt to achieve "consensus" among all parties, but the resulting differences of opinion could not be overcome. The communique issued at the end of the meeting stated that because "there are some differences of opinion that need to be consulted with the governments of each country," the issues in dispute have been handed over to experts for further discussion. According to Agence France-Presse, West German sources believed after the meeting that "the differences of opinion that arose at the meeting cannot be resolved in a short period of time."

    西欧六国经济矛盾难以解决
    外长会议讨论原子联营等问题意见分歧
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社巴黎22日讯：参加欧洲煤钢联营的法国、西德、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡和意大利六个西欧国家的外交部长10月20日和21日在巴黎举行会议，讨论了关于成立所谓“欧洲原子联营组织”和建立共同市场的问题。
    从报纸的报道中可以看出，会议参加者在这两个问题上表现了严重的意见分歧。例如，在讨论成立“欧洲原子联营组织”问题的时候，对于把原子能用于军事方面有极大兴趣的西德，建议私营公司可以同建议中的西欧国家“原子联营组织”一起参加原子能问题的讨论，这实质上是拒绝对原子能使用的监督。法国外交部长比诺和会议的其他参加者要求，给予“原子联营组织”垄断和管制分裂物质的全权，关于这个问题没有达成协议。
    在讨论建立共同市场的问题的时候，法国反对西德的降低关税的计划。法国声明，它不可能在短时间内取消关税壁垒，因为法国国内市场物价比其它国家高。比诺解释说，这是由于法国在“社会需要”上开支很大的原故。但是，巴黎电台指出，这在很大的程度上是因为法国在阿尔及利亚的军事行动上耗费巨大的原故。在这方面，会议还讨论了关于六个国家协调在社会措施方面的开支的问题。据法新社报道，西德代表团声明，西德不能同意缩短工作周和提高工资，西德“不给自己的经济结构制造威胁”。
    会议曾经多次中断，以谋求各方观点“协调一致”，但是结果却没有能够克服意见分歧。在会议结束时发表的公报指出，因为“存在着一些意见分歧需要和各国政府协商”，争论中的问题已经交给专家们进一步讨论。据法新社说，西德人士在会后认为，“在会议上产生的意见分歧是不可能在短时间内解决的”。
