	Gratitude and Joy
	Feng Wenbing
	I often feel both gratitude and immense joy, because I have been educated by the Chinese Communist Party. Before liberation, I never imagined that I would have so much work to do in literature; I thought I had reached a dead end. The key lies in ideological transformation. After 1952, I felt that my professional scope had expanded, and it seemed that my level had also improved. I was eager to try! On the one hand, I knew that my personal abilities were limited, but on the other hand, I was sure that there was a great future to be made. So, in addition to being grateful to the Communist Party, I was also happy that I had the courage and confidence to make amends.

	In the past, I didn't understand some of the masterpieces of ancient China, Du Fu's poems, "Water Margin," "Dream of the Red Chamber," or even Lu Xun's works. Thinking about it, it's really terrible! When I say I didn't understand, I don't mean I didn't understand the language. I understood the language very well, but I didn't understand its meaning. After October 1952, I began to think of Confucius's saying, "Reviewing the old and knowing the new, one can be a teacher." That roughly means that rereading old books leads to a very different understanding, a new understanding. I first reread Lu Xun's works. When I read "Non-Speaking (II)" in "Huagai Collection," I really closed the book and pondered deeply. I understood what the issue of standpoint was. In the past, I couldn't understand this. The greatness of Mr. Lu Xun lies in the fact that his standpoint always stood on the side of the people. That was in Beijing in 1925. Two American soldiers beat a Chinese rickshaw puller and a policeman. More than a hundred Chinese people gathered to beat these two American soldiers, but the American soldiers fled into the Dongjiaominxiang (the foreign embassy area in semi-colonial China, where foreign soldiers were stationed!). Of course, the Chinese people couldn't go in to beat them, because going in would cause trouble. The reactionary intellectuals of China used "Non-Speaking" as the title to ridicule the Chinese people: "Beat! Beat! Declare war! Declare war! Such Chinese people, bah!" Mr. Lu Xun's "Non-Speaking (II)" was a scathing condemnation of reactionary intellectuals. I noticed these two sentences in it: "Why didn't they fight? Although if they fought, someone might say they were 'Boxers.'" Mr. Lu Xun had not yet accepted Marxism-Leninism at this time, and his understanding of the anti-imperialist nature of the Boxers was still unclear. In his own articles, he always used the term "Boxer Rebellion" when referring to the Boxers, but once he participated in actual struggle, he stood on the side of the Boxers—the people! Reading this, it was as if Mr. Lu Xun was teaching me today to understand what is meant by standpoint—in fact, it was the Chinese Communist Party that educated me!

	Rereading Du Fu's poems, there are new questions everywhere. For example, the famous "Present to Wei Ba, the Recluse." I think, this poem was clearly written in the same spring as the three "Officials" and three "Farewells," during the poet's same journey. In "Xin'an Official," "the county is small and there are no more men," "the second choice selects middle-aged men," "fat men have mothers to send them off, thin men are lonely and alone," why is the "recluse's" family welcoming guests, men and women alike, like the world in "Peach Blossom Spring"? This is the real history, the history of the landlord class, "born often exempt from rent and taxes, name not subject to conscription."

	In the past, I didn't admire Wu Song in "Water Margin" very much. Now, it's not at all a pretense of today's me fighting yesterday's me. My thoughts and feelings have naturally changed. I really love the character of Wu Song. After "Water Margin" writes about Wu Song's revenge and fiery anger, it specially includes a description of his fight with Sun Erniang at the Crossroads Inn, solemn and humorous, upright and indomitable, truly a hero's true color. Those who do not understand the beauty of this kind of writing are blind. In the past, I was "blind." The reason is still related to standpoint. If your feelings cannot stand on Wu Song's side, it is easy to be poisoned by foreign bourgeois literary views. Now I want to analyze "Water Margin" carefully and tell its advantages to young readers.

	When I first read the articles criticizing Mr. Yu Pingbo's "A Simple Discussion of Dream of the Red Chamber," I was greatly inspired. At that time, I was suffering from an eye disease and couldn't help but ask someone to buy "Dream of the Red Chamber" and reread it. I laugh at how small I was in the past. I remember that when I was a student at Peking University, I didn't value "Dream of the Red Chamber" very much, because I thought Cao Xueqin didn't understand Li Shangyin's poems. "Dream of the Red Chamber" said that only the line "Leaving the withered lotus to listen to the rain" in Li Shangyin's poems was good. This shows how narrow my interests were, and how much I admired Li Shangyin. I have written novels for at least ten years, precisely because I couldn't reach the realistic spirit of "Dream of the Red Chamber," so I have accomplished nothing.

	I haven't had time to systematically study literary and artistic theory, but my personal scientific level has improved over the past few years by reading newspapers along with everyone. I feel that our current general literary and art enthusiasts are on a higher level than those who taught at Peking University in the early May Fourth period. I myself can now speak without being mysterious (in the past, I was mysterious, and being mysterious is idealism!). I can speak concretely and clearly. Upon careful thought, it turns out that nothing more than the categories of "language," "image," and "type" are at work there, solving problems, how real, how interesting! Comrade Zhou Yang put forward the task of building our country's Marxist literary and artistic theory in the report "The Task of Building Socialist Literature." I would very much like to be a volunteer soldier.

    感谢和喜悦
    冯文炳
    我常常怀着感谢同时有极大的喜悦的感情，原因就是我从中国共产党受了教育。在解放以前我万万想不到在文学方面我还有这么多的工作可做，我以为我已经走进死胡同里面去了的。关键在于思想改造。1952年以后，我感到我的业务范围扩大了，同时仿佛水平也提高了，我跃跃欲试！一方面知道个人的能力有限，一方面确是前途大有可为。所以我于感谢共产党之外，又喜于自己有补过的勇气和信心。
    我过去对中国古代的一些杰作，杜诗、“水浒”、“红楼梦”，甚至对现代鲁迅的著作，都不懂得，想起来真是可怕的事！我说不懂得，不是不懂得它的语言，语言我倒是很懂得，就是不懂得它的意义。1952年10月以后，我开始想到孔夫子一句话，“温故而知新，可以为师矣”。那意思大约是说重读旧日读的书，而了解大不同了，能够有新的了解。我首先重读鲁迅的著作。我读到“华盖集”里面的一篇“并非闲话”（二），真是掩卷深思，我懂得什么叫做立场问题了，过去我就不能懂得这个，鲁迅先生的伟大就因为他的立场总站在人民方面。那是1925年北京的事，两个美国兵打了中国的车夫和巡警，中国人民聚了百余人要打这两个美国兵，美国兵逃进东交民巷（半殖民地中国的外国使馆区域，驻有外国兵！）里面去了，中国人民当然就不能进去打，进去打就要惹出祸事来。中国的反动知识分子乃用“闲话”做题目讥笑中国人民：“打！打！宣战！宣战！这样的中国人，呸！”鲁迅先生的“并非闲话”（二）就是痛骂反动知识分子，我注意到里面这两句话：“他们为什么不打的呢，虽然打了也许又有人说是‘拳匪’”。鲁迅先生这时还没有接受马克思列宁主义，对义和团反帝国主义的性质还认识不清楚，在自己的文章里叙到义和团的事情还总是用“拳匪事件”字样，而一参加实际斗争，就站在义和团——人民的立场上来了！我读到这里，仿佛鲁迅先生今天教育了我，要懂得什么叫做立场，——其实是中国共产党教育了我！
    重读杜诗，处处有新的问题，好比向来有名的“赠卫八处士”，我想，这首诗明明是同三“吏”、三“别”在同一年春天诗人在同一旅途当中写的，在“新安吏”里，“县小更无丁”，“次选中男行”，“肥男有母送，瘦男独伶俜”，何以“处士”家庭男女成行迎接来客很像“桃花源记”里面的世界呢？这却是真实的历史，是地主阶级，“生常免租税，名不隶征伐”的历史。
    我过去读“水浒”很不佩服武松，现在丝毫也不是假装今日之我同昨日之我战，思想感情自然地变了，我真爱武松这个人物，“水浒传”写了武松报仇雪恨火一般的愤怒之后，特地来一场十字坡同孙二娘打架的描写，庄严诙谐，顶天立地，好一个英雄本色。不懂得这种文章之美者，无目者也。我过去就是“无目”，所以然还是立场的关系，感情不能站在武松这一面，就很容易受外国的资产阶级文学观点的毒。我现在想把“水浒”好好地分析一番，把它的好处告诉青年读者。
    当我最初读到批评俞平伯先生“红楼梦简论”的文章，受的启发真不小，那时我正在害眼病，禁不住托人买了“红楼梦”重新读了一遍。我笑我过去真是渺小。我记得我从前在北京大学做学生时不很看重“红楼梦”，原因是以为曹雪芹不懂得李商隐的诗，“红楼梦”里面说李商隐的诗只有“留得枯荷听雨声”一句好。这表现我的兴趣多么狭隘，那么佩服李商隐。我至少也写了十年的小说，正因为对于“红楼梦”的现实主义的精神望尘莫及，所以自己一事无成。
    我还没有来得及系统地作文艺理论的研究，但个人的科学水平从几年来看报跟着大家一路提高了，我觉得我们现在一般的文艺爱好者比五四初期北京大学执教鞭的人要高一层。我自己现在说话能够不玄妙（过去就是玄妙，玄妙就是唯心！），能够说得具体，说得明白，仔细一想原来就不外“语言”，“形象”，“典型”几个范畴在那里发生作用，解决问题，多么真实，多么有趣啊！周扬同志在“建设社会主义文学的任务”的报告里提出建设我国的马克思主义的文艺理论的任务，我很想做一名志愿兵。
