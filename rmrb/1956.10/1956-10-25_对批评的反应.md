    Responses to Criticism

    Letter from the Civil Affairs Bureau of Shenyang: We completely agree with and sincerely accept the criticism published in the People's Daily on August 23 regarding the Zheng Dianzhang incident, directed at our bureau and related personnel. The Zheng Dianzhang incident is a profound lesson for us. To educate cadres, improve our work, and eliminate and prevent the recurrence of similar incidents, we specifically convened a bureau-wide cadre meeting on this incident. Following the meeting, we organized separate forums and discussions to conduct serious ideological analysis and criticism of the mistakes made by the personnel involved, and comprehensively examined the bureau's work. Simultaneously, we organized cadres from the civil affairs sections of various districts to study the People's Daily editorial of August 23 and related articles on the Zheng Dianzhang incident.

    Our bureau has taken disciplinary actions against personnel who were derelict in their duties in handling the Zheng Dianzhang issue.贺统, the former Chief of the Preferential Treatment for Military Dependents Section, has been removed from his position, and his administrative rank has been lowered from level 15 to level 18. 张廷汉, the former staff member of the Preferential Treatment for Military Dependents Section, has been demoted from staff member to clerk, and his administrative rank has been lowered from level 20 to level 23. 李景华, a staff member, has received an administrative demerit.
