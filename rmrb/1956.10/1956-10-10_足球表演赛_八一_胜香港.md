Xinhua News Agency, 9th. The Hong Kong football team lost to the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" football team by a score of 0-7 in an exhibition match held in Beijing this afternoon.

    In the first half of today's game, the Hong Kong team learned from its experience in the game against the Shanghai team on the 8th. The center-back and defenders strengthened their cooperation in defense, marking the opponent's forwards very closely. This prevented the "August 1st" team's forwards from giving full play to their abilities, resulting in them missing many scoring opportunities.

    After the start of the second half, the "August 1st" team launched an all-out offensive, using accurate short passes and the players' speed advantage to increasingly penetrate into the Hong Kong team's penalty area. All six goals scored by the "August 1st" team in the second half were scored within a dozen meters of the Hong Kong team's goal.

    “八一”胜香港
    据新华社9日讯　香港足球队今天下午在北京举行的一场表演比赛中，以○比七败给中国人民解放军“八一”足球队。
    香港队在今天的上半场比赛中，吸取了8日同上海队比赛时的经验，在防守时中卫和后卫加强了合作，把对方的前锋盯得很紧，因而使“八一”队前锋没能充分发挥作用，失掉不少次得分的机会。
    在下半场比赛开始后，“八一”队发动了全面攻势，利用准确的短传和队员们跑的快的优点，越来越多地攻进香港队的禁区。下半场“八一”队踢进的六个球，都是在香港队门前十几公尺附近踢进的。
