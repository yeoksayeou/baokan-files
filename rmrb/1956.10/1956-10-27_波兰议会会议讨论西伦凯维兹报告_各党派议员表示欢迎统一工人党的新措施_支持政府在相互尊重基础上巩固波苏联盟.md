Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 26th: The Polish Parliament's October 24th session, after hearing the report by Minister President Cyrankiewicz on the current political situation in Poland, held a heated discussion on the report and the electoral law bill.

    During the discussion, Deputy Drobner said that news of disagreements at the Party Central Committee's Seventh Plenary Session had been revealed to the working masses, and that very serious differences of opinion existed at the plenary session. For example, there was an anti-intellectual tendency. Moreover, there seemed to be another tendency, attempting to adjust the staffing based on principles of anti-socialist and anti-democratic nationalism and sectarianism, which, of course, is unimaginable within our party and system.

    Referring to Gomulka's report at the Eighth Plenary Session, Drobner pointed out the Central Committee First Secretary's reservations about the draft Five-Year Plan for agriculture. He also emphasized that the report contained many criticisms of the Seventh Plenary Session's assessment of our country's industry and the tasks of realizing the Six-Year Plan.

    Drobner said that we should begin the election with a concrete plan, so that we not only return to achievements, but especially look forward to what should be corrected, and what should be done to achieve improvements, especially now after the Eighth Plenary Session has been held, a new Political Bureau has been elected, and Gomulka has been appointed as the First Secretary of the Central Committee. Drobner further said that if certain elements want to use the events of the past few days to oppose our friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union, then they will be met with our fierce resistance aimed at destroying this poisoned arrow, which may have been transported from abroad.

    The deputy emphasized that every effort should be made to increase labor productivity in the struggle to improve living standards; improve the quality of products; eliminate substandard production, and eliminate bureaucracy, crude work styles, and various malpractices.

    In closing, Drobner also mentioned an election slogan that should not be forgotten – about sincere friendship with the Communist Parties of all countries, about the slogan "Workers of all countries, unite!"

    Democratic Party Deputy Hein followed with a broad speech. He said that in view of the rising tide of democratization in the country's political and economic life, it is necessary to implement a new electoral law and carefully study an appropriate concept for parliamentary work. Therefore, the next parliament should revise the constitution, primarily the chapters on the role and tasks of the supreme organs of power and state administrative organs. The government must be subordinate to and controlled by parliament. This should be achieved by giving parliament the exclusive power to appoint and remove the government and ministers.

    In the deputy's view, the key issue is the relationship between the Polish United Workers' Party and the parliament. Whether the parliament can exercise its power depends on the resolution of this issue. The Polish United Workers' Party should exercise its leading role in national life through the medium of the highest organ of people's power.

    Deputy Hein emphasized that the cooperation between the Polish United Workers' Party and its allied parties should be based on the recognition of the leading role of the Workers' Party and the Polish United Workers' Party's recognition of the role and interests of other parties. All parties should seek solutions to the fundamental problems in national, political and economic life.

    In expressing the attitude of the Democratic Party deputies towards the draft electoral law, Hein said that although it adapts to the current needs, it is necessary to amend some provisions in the draft in order to make this bill fully democratic. He also specifically put forward amendments to these provisions.

    Finally, speaking on behalf of the Democratic Party, the speaker fully supported the program of the Polish United Workers' Party included in Gomulka's speech, and also supported the government's views and measures put forward by Cyrankiewicz in his statement to the parliament, namely consolidating the friendship and alliance between Poland and the Soviet Union on the basis of mutual respect for each other's rights and safeguarding Polish sovereignty.

    United Peasant Party Deputy Stasiak, in his speech, emphasized that the United Peasant Party firmly supports the efforts made to elect a new leadership body of the Polish United Workers' Party.

    He then spoke about the attitude of the peasant deputies towards Polish-Soviet friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union. He said: The progressive forces throughout Poland have great respect for the Soviet Union, the first country in the world to pave the way for all countries to move towards socialism. Therefore, I would like to assure the Soviet comrades on behalf of myself – and I believe also on behalf of my United Peasant Party colleagues – to the delegation of the party's leadership body that is going to hold talks with the leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: what we are now building in our country will be a magnificent and more complete socialism that stems from the wishes and enthusiasm of the people of the whole country.

    Deputy Chorodynski, representing all Catholic deputies, expressed support for the Party's new direction. Referring to the situation of Catholics in People's Poland, he said that many basic requirements related to Catholics' important issues have been neglected in the past. The speaker believes that the meeting between the Catholic deputies and the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party on October 23rd gives reason to hope that these problems can be resolved soon.

    He also said that Gomulka's speech at the Eighth Plenary Session on cooperating with non-Marxists in socialist construction is of paramount importance to the Catholic masses in our country.

    Deputy Jarosinski, speaking on behalf of the deputies of the United Workers' Party, supported the draft electoral law. He emphasized that the Party will gradually make the parliament truly the supreme power and supervisory body of the country, assessing the work of the government and various departments and exercising supervision over international and trade agreements.

    Deputy Ignar, who proposed the draft electoral law, agreed with the opinions of deputies Hein, Jodlowski, and Wind, and on behalf of the committee, recommended that the parliament pass the draft electoral law including the amendments.

    Next, the parliament voted on the new electoral law bill. The meeting unanimously passed the bill and the amendments proposed in the discussion.

    Subsequently, according to the proposal of Speaker Dumbowski, the parliament unanimously passed the following motion: "The parliament requests the State Council to change its decision made on September 24, 1956, and stipulate January 20, 1957 as the date for parliamentary elections."

    The parliament also unanimously passed the changes in the personnel of the Council of Ministers as proposed by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers.

    The October 24th session concluded at this point.

    波兰议会会议讨论西伦凯维兹报告
    各党派议员表示欢迎统一工人党的新措施
    支持政府在相互尊重基础上巩固波苏联盟
    新华社华沙26日电　波兰议会10月24日的会议在听了部长会议主席西伦凯维兹所作的波兰目前政治局势的报告以后，就这个报告和选举法案进行了热烈的讨论。
    德罗布纳议员在讨论时说，党中央第七次全体会议上意见分歧的消息已经向劳动大众透露了，而且在全体会议上，存在着非常严重的意见分歧。例如，有反知识分子的倾向。而且似乎还有另外的倾向，企图在反社会主义和反民主的民族主义和宗派主义性质的原则上来调整干部的配备，当然，这种东西在我们的党和制度内是不可想像的。
    德罗布纳在提到哥穆尔卡在第八次全体会议上的报告时，指出了中央委员会第一书记对五年计划农业草案所抱的保留态度。他也强调说，在这个报告里面，有很多关于第七次全体会议对我们国家的工业和实现六年计划的任务的估价的批评。
    德罗布纳说，我们应当以一项具体计划来着手进行选举，使我们自己不仅回到成就，而且尤其是展望应当改正什么，应当做些什么来取得改进，特别是在现在开过第八次全体会议、选出新的政治局和任命哥穆尔卡为中央委员会第一书记以后。德罗布纳又说，如果某些分子想利用过去几天的事件来反对我们和苏联的友谊和联盟，那么他们将遭到我们的旨在摧毁这支毒箭的猛烈的抵抗，这支毒箭说不定可能是从国外运进来的。
    这位议员强调说，应该尽一切力量，在提高生活水平的斗争中，提高劳动生产率；改进产品的质量；消灭次货生产，消除官僚主义、粗暴作风和各种弊病。
    德罗布纳在结束时又谈到一条不应当忘记的选举口号——关于和各国共产党的真诚的友谊，关于“全世界无产者联合起来”的口号。
    民主党议员哈因接着作了一个广泛的发言。他说，鉴于这个国家的政治和经济生活的民主化的日益高涨的浪潮，需要实行新的选举法和仔细研究出议会工作的一个适当的概念。因此，下届议会应该修改宪法，首先应修改关于最高权力机关和国家行政机关的作用和任务的几章。政府必须隶属于议会，并受它的控制。做到这一点的方法是使议会有任命和撤换政府和部长的独有的权力。
    在这位议员看来，关键问题是波兰统一工人党和议会的关系问题。议会能不能行使它的权力取决于这个问题的解决。波兰统一工人党应该通过人民权力的最高机构的媒介来实行它在国家生活中的领导作用。
    哈因议员强调说，波兰统一工人党和它的联盟党派的合作应该建立在承认工人党的领导作用和波兰统一工人党承认其它党派的作用和利益的基础上。所有党派应该寻找解决国家和政治及经济生活中的基本问题的办法。
    哈因在表达民主党议员们对选举法草案的态度时说，虽然它适应了目前的需要，但是为了使这个法案成为充分民主的，有必要修改草案中的一些条文。他并且具体提出了对这些条文的修正意见。
    发言者在最后代表民主党充分支持在哥穆尔卡发言中所包括的波兰统一工人党的纲领，同时也支持西伦凯维兹在议会上的声明中所提出的政府的观点和措施，即在相互尊重对方权利和维护波兰主权的基础上巩固波兰同苏联的友好和联盟。
    统一农民党议员斯塔夏克在发言中着重指出，统一农民党坚决支持为选出波兰统一工人党新的领导机构而作的努力。
    他接着谈到了农民议员对波苏友谊及跟苏联同盟的态度。他说：波兰全国的进步力量对于在世界上第一个为世界各国走向社会主义铺平道路的国家苏联，怀着极大的敬意。因此，我要以我个人名义——我相信，也是代表我的统一农民党的同事们——要求同苏联共产党的领导举行会谈的党的领导机构的代表团向苏联同志们保证：我们现在在我们国家内所建设的将是出于全国人民的愿望和热情的、壮丽的、更完全的社会主义。
    霍罗丁斯基议员代表全体天主教议员表示支持党的新方针。他在提到人民波兰的天主教徒的情况时说，许多有关天主教徒的重要问题的基本要求在过去一直受到忽视。发言者认为，天主教议员们同波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记在10月23日举行的会议，使人有理由希望这些问题不久即可解决。
    他又说，哥穆尔卡在八中全会上的演说中关于在社会主义建设中和非马克思主义者合作的那部分，对于我们国家中的天主教群众有头等重要的意义。
    雅罗辛斯基议员在发言中代表统一工人党的议员支持选举法草案。他强调说，党将逐渐使议会真正成为国家的最高权力和监督机关、它评定政府和各部门的工作并且对国际协定和贸易协定施加监督。
    提出选举法草案的伊格纳尔议员同意哈因、约德洛夫斯基和温德三位议员的意见，并且代表委员会建议议会通过这项包括修正意见在内的选举法草案。
    接着，议会对新选举法案进行表决。会议一致通过这项法案以及在讨论中所提出的修正意见。
    随后，根据议长邓博夫斯基提议，议会一致通过了如下动议：“议会要求国务委员会改变它在1956年9月24日所作的决定，并规定1957年1月20日为议会选举的日期。”
    议会还一致通过了部长会议主席所建议的关于部长会议人事的更动。
    10月24日的会议至此结束。
