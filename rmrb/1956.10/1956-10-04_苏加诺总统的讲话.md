Brothers and sisters,

　　I have lived among you for several days. As soon as I arrived in Beijing, you greeted me with kindness and excitement, with warm cheers. I express my heartfelt gratitude for your welcome. (Prolonged applause)

　　I feel like I am living at home here. I come from a distant country. Our two countries—Indonesia and China—are thousands of miles apart. My motherland is a country located on the equator with a hot climate. I am now in Beijing, a place with a cold climate. Yes, my body feels cold, but because of everyone's love for me, because of everyone's love for the Indonesian people, my heart does not feel cold, but very warm. (Prolonged applause)

　　My motherland is a vast country; my motherland stretches from west to east as far as from the west coast of Ireland to the Caucasus Mountains; my motherland is a country composed of three thousand inhabited islands; it is a country full of mountains. Among these mountains, there is the majestic, beautiful, and spectacular Mount Semeru. Friends, being with you now, I feel excited and happy, and my heart is hotter than Mount Semeru. (Applause)

　　Yes, friends, according to diplomatic protocol, I am here as the President of the Republic of Indonesia, a republic with a population of 82 million (one-seventh of the Chinese population). According to diplomatic protocol, I am here as a president, but from the bottom of my heart, I am here for a comrade-like visit. Therefore, friends, I ask you: do not call me President Sukarno anymore, just simply call me Brother Gano. (Applause, crowd cheers: Brother Gano, Merdeka!)

　　Friends, nothing would make me more honored than being called Brother Gano, because the name Brother Gano contains the feelings of brotherhood, friendship, and comradeship.

　　Mr. Mayor has indeed praised me too much, complimented me too much. He said that I am an outstanding leader of the Indonesian nation. I am not an outstanding leader of the Indonesian people, I am just the mouthpiece of the Indonesian people. I am often called the father of the Indonesian people, but I am not the father of the Indonesian people, I am the son of the Indonesian people. (The audience shouted: Long live Brother Gano, Merdeka! President Sukarno replied in Chinese, "Thank you.")

　　Yes, friends, I am just Brother Gano, the mouthpiece of the Indonesian people. In Indonesia, I have also instructed the Indonesian people several times that when I die and am buried in Indonesian soil, my tombstone should not read: "The tomb of Dr. Sukarno, Engineer, President of the Republic of Indonesia"; but simply: "The tomb of Brother Gano, the mouthpiece of the Indonesian people." (Applause)

　　I once again express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone for your welcome and respect. I will convey this respect to all the Indonesian people, because your respect for me is in fact respect for the fighting Indonesian people.

　　I am not the giver of Indonesian independence; the independence of the Indonesian people was won through the struggle of the Indonesian people. Without the people, I am nothing; without the people, I am just an ordinary person. However, with the people, thank God, Indonesia is completely independent. With the progressive people of the world, the world will be peaceful, world peace will be realized, and mankind will live in harmony like brothers. (Stormy applause, the audience shouted: Long live peace, Merdeka! Long live President Sukarno!)

　　Yes, friends, I repeat again, what you respect is not Sukarno, but the fighting Indonesian people, the 82 million Indonesian people, the Indonesian people who are friendly to you.

　　But if you think about it more deeply, what are you respecting? Not Sukarno, not the President of the Republic of Indonesia, not the people of Indonesia, but the ideal burning in the hearts of the Indonesian people—the ideal of peace, the ideal of a new world, the ideal of independence, which is also the ideal burning in your hearts. (Applause, cheers: Long live Sino-Indonesian friendship!) Brothers and sisters, let me repeat, what you respect is the ideal that inspires the 82 million Indonesian people to fight for independence, the ideal of a new world, the ideal of human happiness, and the ideal of struggle. You also have the ideal of independence, the ideal of human happiness, the ideal of a new world, and the ideal of world peace. So you respect the Indonesian people. We are fighting for a common ideal, we are inspired by a common ideal. Our hearts are all affected by this ideal. Therefore, we all feel that we are brothers, sisters and comrades. (Applause, cheers: Merdeka, Brother Gano!)

　　Every nation has its great figures. Every great nation has its great figures. India has Mahatma Gandhi, Russia has Vladimir Lenin. China has Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and Zhou Enlai. (The audience cheered)

　　But, please note! What is greater than great figures is the ideal burning in their hearts, the ideal, and once again, the ideal. Gandhi's ideal is greater than Gandhi, Lenin's ideal is greater than Lenin, and the ideals of Sun Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and Zhou Enlai are greater than themselves. (Applause)

　　The ideal is greater than the human body. This ideal is what imperialism fears. Look back at the history of the world, imperialism thinks they can extinguish this ideal by arresting, imprisoning, or even hanging leaders, but this is impossible. They can put leaders in narrow prisons, in cells only one square meter wide, they can shackle them and tie them up, they can chain them like dogs; but the ideal, which is greater than their bodies, will pass through the walls of prisons and cells and spread, friends, it crosses mountains and oceans and enters the hearts of millions of people. (Applause, the crowd shouted: Brother Gano, long live peace!)

　　Friends, the Indonesian people are fighting for their ideal, and the Chinese people are fighting for their ideal. Friends, we were originally in a state of struggle, and we have been in such an environment for decades or even hundreds of years. When we began to be ruled by imperialism in 1596, the ideal of regaining independence and living a prosperous and happy life immediately arose. We launched one resistance after another. We fought wars under the leadership of Sultan Agung, we fought wars under the leadership of Surapati, we fought wars under the leadership of Diponegoro, we fought wars under the leadership of the generals of Aceh; but, friends, because not all the Indonesian people participated in these wars against imperialism, we were defeated by imperialism in these wars. In 1908, we began to establish political groups, but these groups were not yet national in scope. But, friends, later we realized that only when all the Indonesian people from Sabang to Merauke participated in the struggle could the struggle be victorious. Only then did our movement succeed.

　　We launched a national movement for all the people. We launched a national movement in which all the Indonesian people participated. This movement developed more and more vigorously, and finally on August 17, 1945, we declared the independence of Indonesia and established the independent Republic of Indonesia.
(Applause)

　　You also have ideals, the ideal of striving for independence. Has your struggle only lasted for a year, two years, or three years? No, for decades, you have had the ideal of striving for independence, the ideal of striving for human happiness, and the ideal of striving for prosperity. Friends, it is this ideal that has led the Chinese people to wage an indomitable struggle. It is this ideal that has led the Chinese people to oppose prisons, oppose gallows, oppose shootings, oppose the burning of villages, and oppose the bombing of cities. It was this ideal that led to the Taiping Rebellion. It was this ideal that awakened the Chinese people under the leadership of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. It is this ideal that has made the Chinese people stand up under the leadership of your great leader Mao Zedong.
(Applause)

　　So, friends, the Indonesian people have ideals and are inspired by ideals; the Chinese people also have ideals and are inspired by ideals.

　　I said just now that the ideal is greater than man, and the ideal is greater than the human body. The ideal is greater than the nation. The ideal that inspires the Indonesian people and nation is greater than the Indonesian people and nation themselves. The ideal that inspires the Chinese nation is greater than the Chinese nation and the Chinese people themselves. This ideal crosses mountains and oceans, and the ideal in the south meets the ideal in the north. Friends, this is why the Indonesian people sympathize with the Chinese people, and the Chinese people also sympathize with the Indonesian people. (Applause)

　　I said just now that on August 17, 1945, we declared the independence of Indonesia and established the Republic of Indonesia. Soon after this, imperialism launched a counterattack, not only a political counterattack, not only a counterattack by means of economic blockade, but also a military counterattack. Imperialism attacked us with burning, bombs, and grenades, they strafed us with machine guns, they attacked us with everything that could destroy us. Friends, I repeat again, the Indonesian people, the poor, the civilians, in short, all the Indonesian people came to defend their republic, they defended the republic with bamboo spears, broadswords, rifles, bombs, and explosives, and finally, on December 27, 1949, the imperialists were forced to recognize the independence of the Republic of Indonesia. (Applause)

　　I repeat: On August 17, 1945, we declared independence. On December 27, 1949, imperialism recognized our independence. Brothers and sisters, do you know what happened after that? On December 27, 1949, our independence was recognized; in early 1950, our Republic of Indonesia, under the leadership of Prime Minister Mohammad Hatta, recognized the People's Republic of China. (Cheers: Long live Sino-Indonesian friendship!)

　　Yes, in early 1950, many countries hesitated and were unwilling to recognize the People's Republic of China. They said that the Mao Zedong government did not have the support of the Chinese people. However, we are proud that the Indonesian nation recognized the People's Republic of China. Brothers and sisters, there are still many nations, countries, and governments that are unwilling to recognize the People's Republic of China. They are unwilling to recognize the fact that 600 million people support the government of the People's Republic of China. However, I believe that soon, the whole world will recognize the People's Republic of China. (Prolonged applause, cheers: Long live Sino-Indonesian friendship! Long live world peace!)

　　Your struggle is not yet complete. The Indonesian people's struggle is not yet complete either. You are fighting people. The Indonesian nation is also a fighting people. You are fighting people in the midst of struggle. The Indonesian nation is also a fighting people in the midst of struggle. Our friendship is a friendship between two fighting nations. Two fighting nations hold hands with each other. Brothers and sisters, I think the friendship between two warriors is a solid friendship. The friendship between two cowards cannot last, but the friendship between two warriors is lasting and eternal, until their ideals are realized. (Applause) Brothers and sisters! Not only until their ideals are realized, but also after their common ideals are realized, this friendship will be more lasting and closer.

　　Your struggle is not yet complete. Our struggle is not yet complete. You have the Taiwan issue. We have the West Irian issue. You are fighting for Taiwan. We are fighting for West Irian, fighting until West Irian is incorporated into the territory of the Republic. (Applause, cheers: Long live Sino-Indonesian friendship! Long live world peace! Long live Brother Gano!) Move forward! You continue to move forward, continue to struggle. We also continue to move forward, continue to struggle.

　　Move forward and fight with confidence! We are also moving forward and fighting with confidence. You are not isolated, and we are not isolated either. At the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung last year, all the countries participating in the conference opposed colonialism. Sixteen hundred million people gathered at the Asian-African Conference. Sixteen hundred million people oppose colonialism. Sixteen hundred million people are all our friends, your friends, and the friends of the Indonesian people. The voices of these sixteen hundred million people, plus the voices of other progressive people in the world, if you add these people's voices, then the total number is at least two billion who are our friends. So I say: we are not isolated. Let us continue to move forward, let us continue to fight! I firmly believe that our purpose, our goals, our ideals, will one day be fully realized. (The crowd cheered: Long live world peace, long live the Republic of Indonesia!)

　　The victory of the People's Republic of China is the victory of Indonesia. The victory of Indonesia is also the victory of the People's Republic of China. The victory of the People's Republic of China is the victory of all of Asia. The victory of Indonesia is also the victory of all of Asia. Egypt's victory on the Suez Canal issue is the victory of all of Asia, the victory of all anti-imperialist forces, and the victory of all anti-colonialist forces!

　　Friends, let us join hands, continue to move forward, and continue to struggle. Victory must belong to us, and colonialism will surely die. Colonialism cannot but die; the death of colonialism is a law of natural development. No one can keep colonialism from dying. Only those who can stop the sun and the moon from revolving can keep colonialism from dying, and the moon and the sun are revolving non-stop, so we should be sure that one day, colonialism will all die, and imperialism will all die.

　　Long live the happiness and prosperity of all mankind!
　　Long live our struggle!
　　Long live the struggle of the People's Republic of China!
　　Long live the struggle of the Indonesian people!
　　Long live the friendship between China and Indonesia!
　　Long live Asia!
　　Long live human peace!
　　Long live the prosperity of the world! (Applause and cheers)

　　Now I ask all my friends to stand up. (The crowd all stood up) We are all fighting for ideals, for the ideal of independence. You are fighting for independence, and we are also fighting for independence. In Indonesia, when people meet and greet each other, they shout, "Merdeka!" We raise our hands and shout, "Merdeka!" Doing so expresses love, comradeship, and friendship, and symbolizes the struggle for independence. The Indonesian people and the Chinese people are loving, friendly, and have comrade-like friendship, and everyone is fighting together for independence. I ask everyone to wait a moment and join me—I represent the Indonesian people—to raise our hands and shout "Merdeka" five times.
　　"Merdeka"!
　　"Merdeka"!
　　"Merdeka"!
　　"Merdeka"! (The crowd kept cheering, "Merdeka!")

### 苏加诺总统的讲话

1956-10-04
第1版()
专栏：

    苏加诺总统的讲话兄弟姊妹们：
    我在你们当中已经生活了好几天了。我一到北京，你们就以亲切和兴奋的心情，以热烈的欢呼来迎接我的到来。对你们的欢迎，我表示万分感谢。（长时间的鼓掌）
    我感到生活在这里就像生活在自己家里一样。我来自一个遥远的国家，我们两个国家——印度尼西亚和中国——相距几千里。我的祖国是个位在赤道上的国家，气候炎热。我现在在北京，一个气候寒冷的地方。是的，我的身体感到冷，但是，由于大家对我的热爱，由于大家对印度尼西亚人民的热爱，我的心里并没感到寒冷，而是感到非常温暖。（经久不息的掌声）
    我的祖国是个幅员辽阔的国家；我的祖国从东到西有从爱尔兰西海岸到高加索山脉那么远；我的祖国是一个由三千个有人居住的岛屿组成的国家；是个布满着高山的国家。在这些高山当中，有一座巍峨、美丽而又壮观的斯美鲁火山。朋友们，现在和你们在一起，我感到兴奋和愉快，我的心比斯美鲁火山还要热。（鼓掌）
    是的，朋友们，按照外交礼节，我是以印度尼西亚共和国总统的身份，拥有八千二百万人口（中国人口的七分之一）的共和国总统的身份来到这里。按照外交礼节，我是作为一个总统来到这里，但是，从内心说来，我是到这里来进行同志般的访问。因此，朋友们，我要求你们：不要再称呼我苏加诺总统阁下，就简单地称呼我加诺兄吧。（鼓掌，群众欢呼：加诺兄，默地加！）
    朋友们，没有什么会比称呼我加诺兄更使我感到光荣的了，因为在加诺兄这个称呼中，包含着兄弟的感情、朋友的感情和同志的感情。
    市长先生确实是过于推崇我了，过于赞扬我了。他说，我是印度尼西亚民族的一个杰出的领袖。我不是印度尼西亚人民的杰出领袖，我只不过是印度尼西亚人民的喉舌。我常常被称作印度尼西亚人民的父亲，我不是印度尼西亚人民的父亲，我是印度尼西亚人民的儿子。（全场高呼：加诺兄万岁，默地加；苏加诺总统用中国语答称“谢谢”。）
    是的，朋友们，我只不过是加诺兄，是印度尼西亚人民的喉舌。在印度尼西亚，我也曾经几次嘱咐过印度尼西亚人民，等我死后把我埋葬在印度尼西亚土地上的时候，我的墓碑上千万不要写上：“印度尼西亚共和国首任总统苏加诺博士、工学士总统阁下之墓”；而只要简单地写上：“印度尼西亚人民的喉舌加诺兄之墓”。（鼓掌）
    我对各位对我的欢迎和敬意再一次表示万分感谢。我将把这种敬意转达给全体印度尼西亚人民，因为你们对我的尊敬事实上也就是对战斗的印度尼西亚人民的尊敬。
    我不是印度尼西亚人民独立的赐予者，印度尼西亚人民的独立是印度尼西亚人民斗争得来的。没有人民，我算不了什么；没有人民，我只不过是一个普通人。可是，有了人民，感谢真主，印度尼西亚完全独立了。有了全世界进步的人民，世界将会太平，世界和平将会实现，人类将像兄弟般和睦地相处。（暴风雨般的掌声，全场高呼：和平万岁，默地加！苏加诺总统万岁！）
    是的，朋友们，我再重复一次，你们所尊敬的其实不是苏加诺，而是战斗的印度尼西亚人民，是八千二百万印度尼西亚人民，是同你们友好的印度尼西亚人民。
    但是如果更深入地去考虑，那么你们所尊敬是什么呢？不是苏加诺，不是印度尼西亚共和国的总统，不是印度尼西亚的人民，而是印度尼西亚人民胸中所燃烧着的理想——和平的理想、新世界的理想、独立的理想，也就是你们胸中所燃烧着的理想。（鼓掌，欢呼：中国印度尼西亚友好万岁！）兄弟姊妹们，让我再重复一遍，你们所尊敬的是鼓舞着八千二百万印度尼西亚人民独立的理想、新世界的理想、人类幸福的理想和战斗的理想。你们也具有独立的理想、人类幸福的理想、新世界的理想和世界和平的理想。所以你们尊敬印度尼西亚人民。我们为共同的理想而斗争，我们为共同的理想所鼓舞。我们的心都为这种理想所影响。因此，我们共同感觉到我们都是兄弟姊妹和同志。（鼓掌，欢呼：默地加，加诺兄！）
    每一个民族有他的伟大人物。每一个伟大的民族都有他的伟大人物。印度有玛·甘地，俄国有乌·伊·列宁。中国有孙逸仙博士、毛泽东、朱德、周恩来。（全场欢呼）
    但是，请注意！比伟大人物还要伟大的是燃烧在他们胸中的理想，理想，再一次还是理想。甘地的理想要比甘地更伟大，列宁的理想要比列宁更伟大，孙逸仙、毛泽东、朱德、周恩来的理想要比他们本人更伟大。（鼓掌）
    理想要比人类的躯体更伟大，这种理想是帝国主义所害怕的。试翻看世界的历史，帝国主义以为他们可以用逮捕、监禁甚至绞杀领导人的手段来扑灭这种理想，但这是不可能的。他们可以把领导人关进狭窄的监狱，关进只有一平方公尺见宽的牢房，可以给他们加上镣铐和捆绑起来，可以把他们像狗一样的拴上锁链；但是，比他们的躯体还要伟大的理想会穿过监狱和牢房的墙壁伸展开来，朋友们，它越过高山和海洋，投进千百万人们的心中。（鼓掌，群众欢呼：加诺兄，和平万岁！）
    朋友们，印度尼西亚人民为他的理想而斗争，中国人民为他的理想而斗争。朋友们，我们本来是处在斗争的环境中，我们在这样的环境中为时已达数十年甚至数百年之久。在1596年我们开始受到帝国主义的统治的时候，就立即产生要求重新独立、重新过繁荣幸福生活的理想。我们进行了一次又一次的反抗。我们曾在苏丹·阿贡领导下进行过战争，我们曾在苏拉巴底领导下进行过战争，我们曾在蒂波尼哥罗领导下进行过战争，我们曾经在亚齐将领的领导下进行过战争；但是，朋友们，因为并不是全体印度尼西亚人民都参加了这些反对帝国主义的战争，我们在这些战争中被帝国主义击败了。1908年，我们开始建立政治团体，但是，这些团体最初还不是全国范围的。可是，朋友们，后来我们了解到，只有在从沙璜到麦老加的全体印度尼西亚人民都参加了斗争才能使斗争取得胜利，到那个时候，我们的运动才成功了。
    我们展开了全民的民族运动。我们进行了有全体印度尼西亚人民参加的民族运动。这个运动日益澎湃地发展，终于在1945年8月17日，我们宣布了印度尼西亚的独立，成立了独立的印度尼西亚共和国。
  （鼓掌）
    你们也具有理想，具有争取独立的理想。你们的斗争是否才进行一年、两年、三年呢？不是的，几十年来，你们就具有争取独立的理想，争取人类幸福的理想，争取繁荣的理想。朋友们，正是这种理想使中国人民进行了不屈不挠的斗争。正是这种理想使中国人民反对监狱，反对绞刑架，反对枪杀，反对村庄被烧毁，反对城市被轰炸。正是这种理想，引起了太平天国的起义。正是这种理想使中国人民在孙逸仙博士领导下觉醒起来了。正是这种理想使中国人民在你们伟大的领袖毛泽东的领导下站起来了。
  （鼓掌）
    所以说，朋友们，印度尼西亚人民具有理想，受到理想的鼓舞；中国人民也具有理想，受到理想的鼓舞。
    我刚才说，理想比人还伟大，理想比人的躯体还要伟大。理想比民族还要伟大。鼓舞印度尼西亚人民和民族的理想比印度尼西亚人民和民族本身还要伟大。鼓舞中华民族的理想要比中华民族和中国人民本身还要伟大。这种理想越过了高山和海洋，南方的理想同北方的理想会合在一起。朋友们，这就是印度尼西亚人民同情中国人民、中国人民也同情印度尼西亚人民的原因。（鼓掌）
    我刚才说过，我们在1945年8月17日宣布印度尼西亚的独立并成立了印度尼西亚共和国。这之后不久，帝国主义就进行反攻，不仅是政治方面的反攻，不仅是采取经济封锁的手段来进行反攻，而且也在军事方面进行反攻。帝国主义用焚烧、炸弹和手榴弹来攻击我们，他们用机关枪来扫射我们，他们用一切足以毁灭我们的东西来攻击我们。朋友们，我再一次重复说，印度尼西亚人民，贫民、平民，总之，全体印度尼西亚人民都来保卫他们的共和国，他们用竹枪、大刀、步枪、炸弹、炸药来保卫共和国，最后，终于在1949年12月27日，帝国主义方面被迫承认了印度尼西亚共和国的独立。（鼓掌）
    我重复一遍：1945年8月17日，我们宣告独立。1949年12月27日，帝国主义承认了我们的独立。兄弟姊妹们，你们知道以后发生了什么事情吗？1949年12月27日，我们的独立被承认；1950年初，我们印度尼西亚共和国在穆罕默德·哈达总理的领导下承认了中华人民共和国。（欢呼：中国印度尼西亚友好万岁！）
    是的，在1950年初，许多国家犹疑不决，不愿承认中华人民共和国，他们说毛泽东政府得不到中国人民的支持。但是，我们引以为荣的是印度尼西亚民族却承认了中华人民共和国。兄弟姊妹们，现在还有许多民族、国家和政府不愿承认中华人民共和国，他们不愿承认六亿人民拥护中华人民共和国政府这个事实。但是，我相信，不久以后，全世界一定会承认中华人民共和国。（经久不息的掌声，欢呼：中国印度尼西亚友好万岁！世界和平万岁！）
    你们的斗争还没有完成。印度尼西亚人民的斗争也还没有完成。你们是战斗的人民。印度尼西亚民族也是战斗的人民。你们是在战斗中的战斗的人民。印度尼西亚民族也是在战斗中的战斗的人民。我们的友谊是两个战斗民族之间的友谊。两个战斗的民族彼此携着手。兄弟姊妹们，我认为两个战士之间的友谊是巩固的友谊。两个懦夫之间的友谊是不能持久的，但两个战士之间的友谊是持久的，而且是永恒的，一直到实现他们的理想为止。（鼓掌）兄弟姊妹们！不只是一直到实现他们的理想为止，而且在实现了他们的共同理想后，这种友谊将更加持久和更加亲密。
    你们的斗争还没有完成。我们的斗争也还没有完成。你们有台湾问题。我们有西伊里安问题。你们为台湾而斗争。我们为西伊里安而斗争，斗争到西伊里安归入共和国的领土为止。（鼓掌，欢呼：中国印度尼西亚友好万岁！世界和平万岁！加诺兄万岁！）前进吧！你们继续前进，继续斗争。我们也继续前进，继续斗争。
    满怀信心地前进和战斗吧！我们也正满怀信心地前进和战斗着。你们并不是孤立的，我们也同样并不是孤立的。去年在万隆举行的亚非会议，所有参加这个会议的国家，都反对殖民主义。在亚非会议里汇集着十六亿人的声音。十六亿人反对殖民主义。十六亿人是我们大家的朋友，是你们的朋友，也是印度尼西亚人民的朋友。这十六亿人的声音加上世界上其他进步人士的声音，如果再加上这些人的声音，那么，总数最少有二十亿人都是我们的朋友。所以我说：我们并不是孤立的。让我们继续前进，让我们继续战斗吧！我深信，我们的目的，我们的目标，我们的理想，总有一天是可以完全实现的。（群众欢呼：世界和平万岁，印度尼西亚共和国万岁！）
    中华人民共和国的胜利是印度尼西亚的胜利。印度尼西亚的胜利也是中华人民共和国的胜利。中华人民共和国的胜利是全亚洲的胜利。印度尼西亚的胜利也是全亚洲的胜利。埃及在苏伊士运河问题上的胜利，是全亚洲的胜利，是全体反帝国主义力量的胜利，是全体反殖民主义力量的胜利！
    朋友们，让我们共同携起手来，继续前进，继续斗争。胜利一定属于我们，殖民主义一定会死亡。殖民主义不能不死亡，殖民主义的死亡是自然发展的规律。没有一个人能够保住殖民主义不死亡。只有能阻止太阳和月亮运转的人，才能保住殖民主义不死亡，而月亮和太阳是运转不息的，所以我们应该确信，总有一天，殖民主义必将全部死亡，帝国主义必将全部死亡。
    全人类的幸福和繁荣万岁！
    我们的斗争万岁！
    中华人民共和国的斗争万岁！
    印度尼西亚人民的斗争万岁！
    中国——印度尼西亚的友谊万岁！
    亚洲万岁！
    人类和平万岁！
    世界的繁荣万岁！（鼓掌欢呼）
    现在我要求朋友们全体起来。（群众全体起立）我们大家都是为了理想，为了独立的理想而斗争。你们为了独立而斗争，我们也为独立而斗争。我们在印度尼西亚，人民相互见面敬礼时都高呼：“默地加”，我们举手高呼：“默地加”。这样做是表示友爱、同志爱和友谊，象征着争取独立的斗争。印度尼西亚人民同中国人民是互相友爱、友好和具有同志般的友谊的，大家共同为争取独立而斗争。我要求大家等一会同我——我代表印度尼西亚人民——一起举手高呼五次“默地加”。
      “默地加”！
      “默地加”！
      “默地加”！
      “默地加”！
      “默地加”！（群众不断欢呼：“默地加！”）
