Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China met with David Marshall, Chairman of the Labour Front of Singapore and former Chief Minister of Singapore, on the 9th.

David Marshall, as a guest of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, has been staying in China for two months. He expressed his gratitude for the extensive hospitality he had received, especially the pleasant thirty-day trip he had made to most of the major cities in China. He said that what impressed him most was the unity of the entire Chinese mainland and the rapid development of industry.

Regarding the Singapore issue, David Marshall said that further constitutional talks are expected to be held in London soon, and there is an atmosphere of hope. Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Chinese people sincerely sympathize with and support the desire of the people of Singapore for independence. As a citizen of Singapore, David Marshall thanked Premier Zhou Enlai for this friendly and well-intentioned expression, and he also said that he believed that the new constitution of Singapore would, as stipulated in London in May this year, grant Singapore citizenship to all residents of foreign descent who are willing to pledge allegiance exclusively to Singapore, including the 230,000 Chinese who came from mainland China more than a decade ago. The Singapore Labour Front has been sincerely striving to gain recognition of the need to absorb overseas Chinese into Singapore's political life and to attract them to pledge allegiance exclusively to Singapore. David Marshall said that he was very pleased to see that all local political parties and the British government had accepted this view. However, he said, there are still some doubts about the attitude of the Chinese People's Government, especially its attitude towards the issue of dual nationality.

Premier Zhou Enlai stated that it is in the interests of the local people themselves, as well as in the interests of world peace, for the people of all ethnic groups in Singapore and Malaya to unite and fight against colonialism and strive for the complete independence and full development of Singapore and Malaya. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out that a country striving for complete independence must not only oppose the colonialism that is currently oppressing it, but also oppose colonialism from any source. He added that a country that truly opposes colonialism will never allow itself to develop colonialist tendencies at any time. Mr. Marshall fully agreed with these views of Premier Zhou Enlai.

Subsequently, Premier Zhou Enlai expressed the following points on the issue of the nationality of Chinese in Singapore:

	1. The Chinese government is willing to see the Chinese in Singapore obtain Singapore citizenship voluntarily and be completely loyal to the country they are in. The Chinese government believes that this will help promote their own interests, help the stability and tranquility of Singapore, and help develop friendly relations between China and Singapore.

	2. Any Chinese residing in Singapore who voluntarily obtains Singapore citizenship will no longer have Chinese citizenship; of course, their inherent ethnic and cultural ties will continue to exist.

	3. Any Chinese who obtains Singapore citizenship may, if they wish, obtain Chinese citizenship after renouncing Singapore citizenship in accordance with Singapore law.

	4. Any overseas Chinese with Chinese citizenship should respect the laws and decrees of the local government and not participate in local political activities, but their legitimate rights and interests should be respected and not discriminated against.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Chinese government would be happy to fix these principles in legal form through negotiations with the Singapore government after Singapore achieves complete independence.

    接见新加坡劳工阵线主席戴维·马歇尔
    周总理谈新加坡的中国人国籍问题
    新华社12日讯　中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来9日接见了新加坡劳工阵线主席、前新加坡首席部长戴维·马歇尔。
    戴维·马歇尔作为中国人民外交学会的客人，已经在中国逗留了两个月。他对他所受到的广泛的款待，特别是在中国大多数主要城市进行的三十天的愉快的旅行表示感谢。他说，给他印象最深的，是整个中国大陆的团结和工业发展的迅速。
    关于新加坡问题，戴维·马歇尔说，进一步的立宪会谈预期不久将在伦敦举行，而且存在着有希望的气氛。周恩来总理说，中国人民衷心地同情和支持新加坡人民要求独立的愿望。作为新加坡的一个公民，戴维·马歇尔感谢周恩来总理这种友好的善意的表示，他还说，他相信新加坡的新宪法将会像今年5月在伦敦所同意了的规定给予所有那些愿意专对新加坡效忠的外国血统居民以新加坡公民的资格，包括十多年前从中国大陆来的二十三万中国人在内。新加坡劳工阵线一直在真诚地努力争取使吸收华侨参加新加坡的政治生活和吸引他们专对新加坡效忠的必要性得到承认。戴维·马歇尔说，他很高兴地看到，所有当地的政党以及英国政府都接受了这种看法。然而，他说，关于中国人民政府的态度，特别是它对双重国籍问题的态度，人们还有一些怀疑。
    周恩来总理表示，新加坡和马来亚的各族人民团结起来，为反对殖民主义、争取新加坡和马来亚的完全独立和充分发展而斗争，是既符合于当地人民自己的民族利益，也符合于世界和平的利益的。周恩来总理指出，一个争取完全独立的国家，不仅要反对现在压迫着它的殖民主义，而且要反对来自任何方面的殖民主义。他又说，一个真正反对殖民主义的国家，绝不会容许它自己在任何时候发生殖民主义的倾向。马歇尔先生完全同意周恩来总理的这些主张。
    接着，周恩来总理就新加坡的中国人的国籍问题，表示了以下几点：
    1、中国政府愿意看到新加坡的中国人取得他们自愿取得的新加坡的公民资格，完全效忠于他们所在的国家。中国政府相信，这将有助于促进他们本身的利益，有助于新加坡的稳定和安宁，有助于中国同新加坡之间的友好关系的发展。
    2、任何居住在新加坡的中国人，只要他们自愿地取得新加坡公民资格，就不再具有中国公民资格；当然他们所固有的种族联系和文化联系仍然继续存在。
    3、任何取得新加坡公民资格的中国人，如果他们愿意的话，可以在根据新加坡法律放弃新加坡的公民资格以后，取得中国的公民资格。
    4、任何具有中国公民资格的侨民应当尊重当地政府的法令，不参加当地的政治活动，但是他们的正当权益应该受到尊重而不被歧视。
    周恩来总理说，中国政府将乐于在新加坡取得完全的独立之后，同新加坡政府经过谈判途径，把以上这些原则用法律的形式固定下来。
