Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 9th October. The Poznań Provincial Court sentenced three criminals on October 8th for assaulting public security officer Iszdebski. Fortinovich was sentenced to four and a half years, Szurek to four years, and Sroka to four and a half years.

　　The trial began at 8 a.m. on September 27th. The first group of twelve defendants to be tried were divided into two courts. These twelve criminals were the first group of provocateurs prosecuted by the procuratorial organs to the court. In the court, in addition to the judges and prosecutors, there were more than thirty people including people's assessors and witnesses. There were also twelve defense lawyers. These lawyers were hired by the defendants to defend themselves. The weapons used by the provocateurs - submachine guns, etc. - were displayed in court.

　　After more than a week of trial, the court found that Fortinovich and the other two had participated in the crime of beating Iszdebski, but considering that the criminals were all young people, the court gave them a lighter sentence, making the above judgment.

　　The Polish people are very concerned about the trial of these provocateurs. Polish Radio broadcast the trial live to the people of Poznań. More than thirty Polish journalists and more than twenty foreign journalists covered the trial in court.

　　波兰审讯波兹南事件罪犯
    其中三个罪犯已分别被判处有期徒刑
    据新华社华沙9日电　波兹南省法院已经在10月8日对三名殴打公安人员伊什德布尼的罪犯作出了判决。其中福耳提诺维奇被判处四年半徒刑，舒雷克被判处四年徒刑，斯罗卡被判处四年半徒刑。
    审讯工作是在9月27日上午8时开始的，第一批出庭受审的共有十二个被告，分作两个法庭进行审判。这十二个罪犯都是由检察机关向法院起诉的第一批挑衅分子。在法庭上，除了法官和检察官外，还有人民陪审员、见证人等三十多人。另外还有十二个辩护律师。这些律师都是被告请来为自己进行辩护的。法庭上陈列有挑衅分子们使用过的武器——手提机关枪等。
    法庭经过一个多星期的审讯判明：福耳提诺维奇等三人曾经参加了殴打伊什德布尼的罪行，但是考虑到罪犯们全是青年，所以法庭对他们从轻处刑，作出了上面的判决。
    波兰人民都十分关心对这些挑衅分子的审判。波兰电台把审判过程向波兹南人民作实况广播。有三十多个波兰记者和二十多个外国记者在法庭上采访。
