Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 5th. After more than two years of exploration by the 127th team of the Central South Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau, the Hebi Coalfield in the eastern foothills of the Taihang Mountains in northern Henan Province has been proven to have reserves sufficient to establish an important coal base.

	This coalfield is approximately 100 kilometers long from north to south and 5 kilometers wide from east to west. At present, the geological personnel have completed the detailed investigation of five well field areas and submitted the geological data for five pairs of large and medium-sized modern vertical shafts. The average thickness of the minable coal seams in this coalfield is about eight meters, and the thickest coal seam is as much as twelve meters. The distribution of the coal seams is also relatively stable. The vertical shafts need to be constructed to a depth of no more than 350 meters in order to extract all the coal.

	In addition to power coal and civil coal, this coalfield also contains some lean coal needed for coking. After these lean coals are mined in the future, they can be used in conjunction with the prime coking coal and fat coal that will be mined at the Pingdingshan Coal Mine to supply the Wuhan Iron and Steel Base for coking.

    河南省鹤壁煤田储量丰富
    新华社郑州5日电　河南省北部太行山东麓的鹤壁煤田，经过中南煤田地质勘探局一二七队两年多的勘探，证明储量足能建立一个重要的煤炭基地。
    这个煤田南北长约一百公里，东西宽五公里。目前，地质人员已经完成了五个井田区的精查，并且交出了五对大、中型现代化竖井的地质资料。这个煤田的可采煤层平均厚度八公尺左右，最厚的煤层达十二公尺。煤层的分布也比较平稳，建设的竖井不超过三百五十公尺深，就能够把煤全部开采出来。
    这个煤田除了有动力用煤、民用煤以外，还有着一部分炼焦需要的瘦煤。这些瘦煤将来开采出来以后，可以同平顶山煤矿将开采的主焦煤、肥煤相配合，供应武汉钢铁基地炼焦用。
