    The Fruit of Friendly Assistance
    Guo Li, Deputy Director of the First Automobile Works
    The First Automobile Works—this factory, equipped with top-notch technology, was able to commence production in a short three years, which is inseparable from the comprehensive and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. From the selection and surveying of the factory site, the collection of original data, the comprehensive factory design, construction, equipment manufacturing, equipment installation, production preparation, production adjustments, all the way to organizing automobile production, everything is permeated with the fraternal friendship of the Soviet Union.
    In order to help our country build an automobile factory, the Soviet Union mobilized many agencies and hundreds of thousands of people. Twenty-six specialized Soviet design agencies shared the factory's design work, and almost all famous Soviet machinery manufacturing plants manufactured equipment for us. In particular, the Moscow Automobile Factory, which directly assisted and was responsible for coordinating various aspects of work on our behalf, made significant contributions. The Moscow Automobile Factory specifically established the "First Automobile Works Management Office," organizing experts from various fields to participate in the work. In addition to directly assisting us in the complete set of process design, it also acted as the representative of the First Automobile Works, managing all matters related to design and ordering.
    The main equipment of the First Automobile Works was supplied by the Soviet Union, and much of it was being trial-produced for the first time in the Soviet Union. For example, the 3,500-ton giant mechanical press, combined spot welding machine, and gear processing equipment manufactured by the Moscow Automobile Factory, as well as the 8,000-cycle DC generator, high-frequency quenching machine, and various special equipment manufactured by other machine plants, were all trial-produced according to new designs.
    Our close friends estimated that we would have difficulties in manufacturing the large number of tools required for the initial production of automobiles, and helped us manufacture most of the complex tools, jigs, dies, and molds.
    Even more important assistance was the dispatch of a large number of outstanding experts. In our factory, in every stage of construction, the footprints of Soviet experts were everywhere. In order to help us solve the difficulties encountered in our work, they often worked day and night. Their high degree of internationalism and socialist labor enthusiasm encouraged us and set a good example for our work. Each expert trained several apprentices. The experts all guaranteed that when they returned to their country, they would ensure that Chinese comrades could replace their work. Many people have, under the enthusiastic guidance of experts, transformed from being completely ignorant of their profession to becoming experts.
    The Moscow Automobile Factory accepted a large number of our interns for training. They selected experts in various specialties as mentors for all the interns. The mentors regarded teaching Chinese interns as their honor. These interns are today the initial production backbone of the First Automobile Works.
    The assistance of the Soviet government and people, especially the Moscow Automobile Factory, was not only based on contracts and agreements, but also proactively considered our needs in many aspects. They considered everything we did not consider due to our lack of experience. For example, how to consider the conditions for future expansion in the design, and considering that Chinese workers did not understand Russian during equipment manufacturing, making operation inconvenient, they spent a lot of effort writing instructions in Chinese. In order to take care of the difficulties in our production, in addition to providing us with design data, they also provided us with some necessary work data for reference.
    In this kind of meticulous and great assistance, the First Automobile Works established a direct and deep friendship with the Soviet Moscow Automobile Factory. Automobile factories and factories, workshops and workshops, individuals and individuals in the two countries often exchanged information and encouraged each other. This friendship has greatly promoted our learning and mastering of technology.
    The First Automobile Works has just begun to produce automobiles, and has just begun to master the technology. We must work harder to learn from the Soviet Union in the future. When the First Automobile Works is completed and put into production, let us express our lofty gratitude to the Soviet government and people, to the various Soviet departments that have made great contributions to the Chinese automobile factory, and to all the staff and workers of the Moscow Automobile Factory, and let the friendship between our two factories be increasingly consolidated.

    友谊援助的结晶
    第一汽车制造厂副厂长　郭力
    第一汽车制造厂——这个以头等技术装备起来的工厂，能在短短三年的时间里投入生产，是同苏联的全面无私的援助分不开的。第一汽车厂从厂址选择勘察、原始资料搜集、全面的工厂设计、建筑施工、设备制造、设备安装、生产准备、生产调整，直到组织汽车生产，都渗透着苏联兄弟般的友谊。
    苏联为了帮助我国建设汽车厂，动员了许多机关和成千上万的人们。苏联有二十六个专业设计机关分担着工厂的设计工作，几乎所有著名的苏联机械制造厂都为我们制造过设备，特别是直接援助和代我们负责联系各方面工作的莫斯科汽车厂，更作出了重大的贡献。莫斯科汽车厂专门成立了“第一汽车制造厂管理处”，组织了各方面的专家参加工作，除了帮助我们直接进行全套工艺设计以外，还作为第一汽车制造厂的代表，掌握设计和订货等全部事宜。
    第一汽车厂的主要的设备都是苏联供应的，其中有许多设备在苏联还是第一次试制。如莫斯科汽车厂制造的三千五百吨巨型机械压床、联合点焊机、齿轮加工设备等，以及其他机器厂制造的八千周波的直流发电机、高周波淬火机和各种专用设备等，都是根据新的设计试制的。
    我们亲密的朋友估计到我们初期生产汽车所需要的大量工具在制造上有困难，帮助我们制造了大部分复杂工具、卡具、冲模和模型。
    更重要的援助是派遣了大批的优秀专家。在我们的工厂里，在各个建厂阶段中，到处都有苏联专家的足迹。为了帮助我们解决工作中遇到的困难，他们经常废寝忘餐地工作着。他们的高度的国际主义精神与社会主义的劳动热情鼓舞着我们，给我们树立了良好的工作榜样。每一位专家都培养了几个徒弟。专家们都保证说，当他们回国时，一定使中国同志能够代替他们的工作。有许多人都在专家热心培养下，已由原来对自己的专业一无所知变成了内行。
    莫斯科汽车厂接受我们大批实习生前去实习。他们为所有实习生选择了各种专业的专家作导师。导师们都把教会中国实习生作为自己的荣誉。这些实习生就是今天第一汽车厂初期的生产骨干。
    苏联政府和人民，特别是莫斯科汽车厂对我们的援助，不仅仅是根据着合同和协议，而且在许多方面主动地为我们考虑。凡由于我们没有经验考虑不到的地方，他们都替我们考虑到了。例如在设计中如何考虑准备今后扩建的条件问题，在设备制造中考虑到中国工人不懂俄文，操作不便，因而费了很大的力气写上中文的指示牌。为照顾我们生产中的困难，除供给我们设计资料以外，还供给我们一些必需的各种工作资料，以便参考。
    在这样的无微不至的伟大援助中，第一汽车厂同苏联莫斯科汽车厂之间建立起了直接的深厚的友谊。两国的汽车工厂和工厂，车间和车间、个人和个人之间经常互通信息，互相鼓舞。这种友谊对于我们学习技术，掌握技术起了很大的促进作用。
    第一汽车制造厂生产汽车还刚刚开始，在掌握技术上还刚刚入门。我们今后必须更加向苏联努力学习。当第一汽车厂建成投入生产的时候，让我们向苏联政府和人民，向为中国汽车厂而作出伟大贡献的苏联各个部门，向莫斯科汽车厂的全体职工致以崇高的谢忱，让我们两厂间的友谊日益巩固。
