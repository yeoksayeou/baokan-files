Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 24th. The Nanping Special District, a mountainous area in northern Fujian Province, has completed fifty-two small hydropower pumping stations (i.e., water turbine pump stations). The total irrigation capacity of these stations reaches more than 16,800 mu of farmland. There are currently three more stations under construction.

The water turbine pump is a new type of irrigation tool successfully created by the Fujian Provincial Agricultural Implement Experiment Department three years ago. It uses the natural drop of streams for water pumping without fuel or machine rooms. Building a hydropower pumping station that can irrigate 400 mu of farmland generally only costs 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. After completion, management is also extremely convenient and simple.

The northern mountainous areas of Fujian Province have dense streams, abundant water volume, and steep riverbeds, providing good natural conditions for installing water turbine pumps. The hydropower pumping stations that have already been built are all located in areas where the land is high and the water source is low. In the past, these areas relied on the weather and often suffered from drought. Since the introduction of water turbine pumping, the threat of drought has been eliminated, and increased production has been achieved.

The Nanping Special Commissioner's Office Water Conservancy Bureau recently systematically summarized the experience of various places in the special district in building hydropower pumping stations and plans to build more than fifty more hydropower pumping stations this winter and next year.

### 利用优越的自然条件  福建山区建设小型抽水机站

    利用优越的自然条件
    福建山区建设小型抽水机站
    据新华社福州24日电　福建省北部山区——南平专区已建成五十二个小型水力抽水机站（即水轮泵抽水站）。这些站的灌溉能力共达一万六千八百多农亩。目前还有三个站正在兴建中。
    水轮泵抽水机是福建省农具试验部在三年前创造成功的一种新型的灌溉工具。它利用溪流的天然落差水力进行抽水，不用燃料，不需机房。建成一个能灌溉四百亩农田的水力抽水机站，一般只需三千到四千元。建成后管理也极方便简单。
    福建省北部山区溪涧密布、水量充足、河床很陡，安装水轮泵的自然条件较好。现在已建成的水力抽水机站都是在田地位置较高、水源较低的地区。这些地区过去靠天吃饭，经常遭旱，自从有了水轮泵抽水，干旱威胁解除了，获得了增产。
    福建省南平专署水利局最近系统总结了全专区各地建设水力抽水机站的经验，准备在今冬和明年再建五十多个水力抽水机站。
