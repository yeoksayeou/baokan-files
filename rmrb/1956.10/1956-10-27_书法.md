    Calligraphy
    Pu Xuezhai
    Calligraphy is a discipline with a long history and rich resources in the Chinese cultural tradition, and it is also a unique art form in China. Over the millennia, it has undergone numerous upheavals, and the number of losses is incalculable. However, the existing ink rubbings and stele inscriptions, some dating back one or two thousand years, have become invaluable national treasures. For example, the ink rubbings of various masters from the Jin Dynasty to the Song and Yuan Dynasties, currently displayed in the Painting Gallery of the Palace Museum, are available for viewing and study. Zhao Mengfu said that in the past, people who obtained a few lines of ancient inscriptions and studied them diligently could become famous. Therefore, it is not too late for us to inherit this long-neglected excellent tradition.
    Since the Qin, Han, Wei, and Jin dynasties, generations have succeeded each other, and talented people have emerged in large numbers. From ancient simplicity, it has evolved into "heroic and elegant," "vigorous," "charming," and "precipitous," with various styles, each displaying its own wonders. It is truly a scene of a hundred schools of thought contending and a hundred flowers blooming, a magnificent sight. Scholars who love antiquity regard even a single scrap of paper or a word from a famous calligrapher as a treasure, which is valued by people at home and abroad. Until modern times, solemn and important records such as inscriptions on steles and epitaphs, as well as plaques and couplets hung in the market, and even title cards, all sought the writing of famous calligraphers for solemnity and beauty. This has already shown that it is loved and needed by the broad masses. Moreover, let's not even talk about its close relationship with traditional Chinese painting. However, in the decades of reactionary government rule, traditional culture has long been thrown to the winds, so ancient masterpieces scattered in various places often fell into foreign hands, which is regrettable. At the same time, there have been very few people who have become famous as calligraphers.
    After liberation, in the era of the Party and the government leading the construction of a new China, everything was being revived. More attention was paid to classical literature and art, and now there are many young and middle-aged people who want to become successors of literature and art, but they just don't know where to start and have no way to learn. Therefore, we united more than a dozen comrades who have studied calligraphy and applied to the Civil Affairs Bureau to establish a "Beijing Chinese Calligraphy Research Society." At present, it has been approved for preparation. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, we are catching up quickly, and the revival of excellent traditional calligraphy is within sight.
    I would also like to talk about the issue of tools. The ancients said, "If a craftsman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools," which is reasonable.
    The so-called "Four Treasures of the Study" are paper, brush, ink, and inkstone. I think the brush is the most important, followed by paper, then ink, and finally the inkstone. Although I have never seen the brushes used by the ancients, some records mention that the ancients mostly used strong bristles, which are now called purple rabbit hair brushes. There is a poem by Bai Juyi praising purple rabbit hair brushes, which is sufficient to verify this. There is also the saying "Calligraphy values thinness and hardness to communicate with the divine," which can also prove that it was definitely not written with sheep hair brushes. Furthermore, looking at the ink rubbings of the ancients, one can see that the current purple rabbit hair brushes can only write characters within one inch well, and if they are larger than inch-sized characters, they are not very useful and one has to use wolf hair or mixed hair brushes. Among wolf hair brushes, those from Caoyang Fus顺堂 were the best, but they no longer exist. In previous years, Yu Yunhe had a kind of chicken wolf hair brush that was very good. Writing with it could quite capture the artistic intent of the ancients, being square and round as desired, and turning smoothly. Now it is also gone. Some people consider being able to use sheep hair brushes as skill, but whether this is correct needs further study. As for paper, it is best to be firm and delicate. What the ancients liked to use were hard yellow paper and powdered paper, etc. These were from before the Song Dynasty. By the Ming Dynasty, there were Korean clean-faced paper and other types of paper. In short, it should be able to bring out the luster of the ink. In recent times, some people often use unsized paper, which of course is not impossible, but it is not beautiful enough in terms of the flexibility of the brushwork and the brilliance of the ink. As for ink, it is best to have light glue and be firm, so that it does not hinder the brush. It is even better if the written characters shine with a blue light, which is the origin of the name "purple jade light." Inkstones are relatively simple. We will not talk about inkstones with "antique" qualities here. As long as it can grind ink, is made of firm and moist stone, and does not dry out easily, it is enough. It is quite enough for one person to have one or two. However, the manufacturing of the above four items should also be studied.

    书法
    溥雪斋
    书法是在中国文化传统中有悠久历史和丰富资料的一门，也是中国独有的一种艺术，几千年来屡经变乱，丧失之数固不可计，而今日所存者尚有少数一二千年以上的墨迹和碑帖都成为不可多得之国宝，如现在故宫博物院绘画馆所陈列的由平复帖（晋）直至宋元各大家的墨迹足供观摩。赵松雪说，昔人得古刻数行，专心学之便可名世，那末现在我们要继承这个搁置已久的优良传统还是不算太晚。
    自秦汉魏晋以来，世世相承，人才辈出，由古拙变为“雄秀”“刚劲”“妩媚”“险峻”，多种多样无不各尽其妙，真是百家争鸣，百花齐放，洋洋大观，好古之士偶得名家片纸只字莫不视为瑰宝，为中外人士所重视。直至近代，每遇庄严隆重的记载如碑铭墓志等，以及市面所悬挂的匾额对联，以至于标题名片等，莫不寻求名手书写，以为隆重和美观，这已然说明广大群众所喜爱和需要的，且先不谈与国画更有密切的关系了。可是几十年来在反动政府统治时期早已把传统文化抛在九霄云外了，因而古代名迹散在各地每每流落国外成为恨事，同时也就很少有以书家成名的人出现了。
    解放后，在党和政府领导建设新中国的时期是百废俱举了，对于古典文艺更加重视了，而现在无论青年中年要作一个文艺继承者更是大有人在，只是不得其门而入无从学起，所以我们联合了对于书法有研究的同志十几个人，呈请民政局成立了一个“北京中国书法研究社”，目前已蒙批准筹备，在党政领导下急起直追，优良传统书法的复兴是计日可达。
    我还想附带着谈谈工具的问题，古人所谓“工欲善其事，必先利其器”是合理的。
    所谓文房四宝就是纸、笔、墨、砚四样东西，我以为主要的笔是第一，纸为第二，墨为第三，砚在第末。古人所用的笔，虽说未曾见过，有些记载也谈到古人多用健毫，也就是现在所谓紫毫笔，紫毫就是兔毫，白香山的诗里有咏紫毫笔的一首足以考证。也有“书贵瘦硬方通神”一语也可以证明，再看看古人的墨迹更可以知道绝不是羊毫笔所写的，而现在所有的紫毫只能写一寸以内的字还有好的，若是在寸楷以上的就不大好用了，就得用狼毫或兼毫。狼毫是以宷阳福顺堂的最好，现在没有了，在前些年虞云和有一种鸡狼毫是很好的，写起来颇能会合古人笔意，方圆应手，圆转自如，现在也不见了。有人以用羊毫为能，是否正确，再研究吧。纸呢？是以坚实细腻为上，古人所喜用的是，硬黄?粉等类，这是宋以前的，到了明代有高丽净面笺等类的纸，总之是以能发扬墨的光彩为宜。近时也有人常用生纸，当然不是不可以，而在用笔的灵活上、墨彩的光辉上是不够美的。墨呢，是以轻胶质坚为上，可以不滞笔，若写出字来闪蓝光的更好，就是“紫玉光”名称的由来。砚台是较比简单些，所谓带“古董”性的，这里不谈砚台，只要能下墨，石质坚润，不爱干就足够了，一人能有一、二方就满可以了。可是对以上这四样东西的制造情况也是应当研究的。
