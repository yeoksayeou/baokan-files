    Joint Team Red vs. Shanghai
    Football Selection Competition Most Exciting Today

    This afternoon at 3:00 PM, the football match between Joint Team Red and the Shanghai team at the Beijing Xian Nong Tan Stadium will be the most exciting and crucial football match of this Chinese Olympic Games selection competition. Whoever wins will likely be the champion of this selection competition.

    Joint Team Red is the original lineup of the football team that visited India, Burma, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia on behalf of our country. They have more match experience; the players have good basic skills, the forwards are good at attacking, especially good at short passes and crossover positioning, and their shooting ability is also good. Goalkeeper Zhang Junxiu is also one of the most famous goalkeepers in the country. Therefore, blocking Joint Team Red's attack and breaking through their last line of defense is quite difficult.

    The Shanghai team, a rising star in the football world, has only begun to show its talent in the past six months. The players are young and energetic. The two wingers' rapid cuts, the forwards' finishing kicks, and the defenders' rigorous defense all make their opponents feel tricky. This summer, they defeated the Soviet Pacific Fleet football team 6-1, and after defeating the Hong Kong team 6-1 in this selection competition, they are in high spirits and the whole team is full of confidence in winning the final victory.

    However, the Shanghai team also has certain weaknesses: insufficient match experience, and their basic passing and dribbling skills are not yet proficient enough; these are precisely the advantages of Joint Team Red. Therefore, technically speaking, Joint Team Red, as the "older brother," has the upper hand.

    It is also worth noting that two months ago, Joint Team Red suffered repeated setbacks during its visit to Yugoslavia and was demoralized. After returning to China, the whole team made a review. Although there was a slight improvement in the previous match against the Pakistani football team, compared with the Shanghai team, the Shanghai team has a stronger fighting will in the battle that determines the overall victory or defeat.

### 联队红队战上海  足球选拔赛今天最精采

    联队红队战上海
    足球选拔赛今天最精采
    今天下午三时，在北京先农坛体育场举行的联队红队对上海队的一场足球比赛，将是这次中国奥林匹克运动队选拔赛中最精采的和带有关键性的一场足球比赛。谁取得了胜利，谁就有可能获得这次选拔赛的冠军。
    联队红队是代表我国访问印度、缅甸和苏联、南斯拉夫的足球队的原班人马，有较多的比赛经验；队员基本技术较好，前锋善于攻坚，尤擅长短传和交叉换位，射门能力也不错。守门员张俊秀也是目前国内有名的门将之一。因此阻挡联队红队的进攻和突破他们最后一道防线，是相当艰难的。
    上海队，这支足球界中的后起之秀，只是在最近半年才初露锋芒，队员年轻，体力充沛，两个边锋的神速切入，前锋的临门一脚，以及后卫防守的严谨，都使同他们比赛的对手感到棘手。今夏，他们以六比一击败了苏联太平洋舰队足球队，在这次选拔赛中又以六比一的压倒优势战胜了香港队以后，士气旺盛，全队充满了争取最终胜利的信心。
    但是上海队也有一定的弱点：比赛经验不足，传球、带球的基本技术还不够熟练；而这些正是联队红队的优点。因此，从技术上来说，作为“老大哥”的联队红队占着上风。
    值得注意的还有这样一个因素：两个月前联队红队在访问南斯拉夫的时候，接连受挫，士气不振。回国以后，全队作了检查，在不久以前对巴基斯坦足球队的一战中，虽然已经略有起色，但是同上海队比较起来，在关系大局胜负的战斗意志上，上海队要较为旺盛一些。
