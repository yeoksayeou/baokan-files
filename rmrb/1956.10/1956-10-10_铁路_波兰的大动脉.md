Railways – Poland's Lifeline
	Xie Wenqing

	It was a Sunday in summer, in Warsaw's "Bielany" Park, where a group of enthusiastic young men and women invited me to take photos and chat for most of the day. It wasn't until it was almost time to say goodbye that I learned they had come to Warsaw for the weekend from Wrocław, more than 300 kilometers away. This is a common occurrence in Poland. For example, in Warsaw, every Sunday there are groups of travelers from all over Poland. Some of them take the train on Saturday night, sleep until they arrive in Warsaw. After enjoying a full day of relaxation, they take the train back in the evening. The group from Wrocław boarded the train at eight o'clock that night to return home.

	The spiderweb-like network of railways connects all the large and small towns in Poland, making it possible for people all over the country to fully utilize rail transportation. In the People's Poland, which covers an area of more than 310,000 square kilometers, there are 25,000 kilometers of (mainly double-track) railway lines extending vertically and horizontally (of which more than 450 kilometers have been electrified), with an average of ten kilometers of railway per hundred square kilometers of land. Poland has a long history of tradition and technical experience in the railway industry and railway transportation. Because Poland is a country with a large coal production in Europe, railways began to be built in Poland as early as the mid-nineteenth century. At the same time, Poland is located in the very center of the European continent. If straight lines are drawn between the farthest edges of the European continent, it can be seen that the intersection of these straight lines is near Warsaw. Therefore, Poland's railway transportation has great international significance. The shortest land route from Paris to Moscow and from Northern Europe to the Balkan countries passes through Warsaw. Warsaw is the largest railway junction in Poland, with nine railways leading to all parts of Poland and Europe. Railways are also the most important means of transportation in People's Poland, accounting for 85% of the country's total annual passenger and freight volume. Although the new railways built in the twelve years since the founding of People's Poland account for only 25% of the original lines, the total volume of passengers and freight transported by railways last year was three and a half times that before the war. In terms of population, Poland's annual freight volume by rail is the first in Europe, and its passenger volume is the second in Europe, after Switzerland. Based on the number of passenger tickets sold in 1955, Poland had an average of thirty-seven train rides per person.

	Looking back at the scene just after the war, it can be understood how these achievements were achieved under such difficult conditions. Comrade Janek, an old railway worker, said to me: "Now, you can travel all over Poland's big cities and small towns without getting off the train. But if you traveled in Poland in 1945, I'm very sorry, you would have to get off the train and walk across the destroyed bridges and sections on almost every line. Because more than 10,000 kilometers of our railway subgrade were destroyed during the war, the destroyed bridges totaled more than 70 kilometers in length, and 2,000 locomotives could not be started!"

	It was on this dilapidated foundation that the Polish railway workers rebuilt and developed railway transportation and made it have a world-advanced level. In order to commend the selfless labor and achievements of railway workers, the government decided in 1954 that the second Sunday of September each year would be Railway Workers' Day. Last year, when the railway workers celebrated the festival, a total of more than 11,000 advanced workers were awarded medals and awards by the government. The achievements of Polish railway workers in saving fuel coal and improving railway transportation capacity are the most significant. Technological innovation and improvements in labor organization have made it possible to continuously reduce the amount of coal consumed by trains and greatly increase transportation capacity, even with the continuous increase in passenger and freight volume. This year, the coal consumption quota for trains is 2.5 million tons less than in 1949, which is enough for all Polish trains to burn for three months in winter. However, this year's passenger and freight transportation tasks are much more than in 1949.

	The railway industry of People's Poland can now manufacture complete sets of railway equipment. In recent years, more than 20 types of electric locomotives, diesel locomotives and new internal combustion locomotives have been manufactured in railway factories. Among them, the "TY-51" locomotive was rated as one of the best locomotives in international competitions. Railway equipment is an important export commodity of People's Poland, ranking third among Polish exports, second only to coal and ships. Polish locomotives and various carriages are sold far to Asian and African countries.

	Railways are the lifeline of Poland. The development of railway transportation and the railway industry has played an important role in the rapid development of Polish industry and the entire national economy after the war.

　　铁路——波兰的大动脉
　　谢文清
    是夏天的一个星期日，在华沙的“比兰诺”休息公园中，我被一群热情的青年男女邀在一起摄影并攀谈了大半天。直到快要告别时，我才知道他们原来是从三百多公里外的伏罗兹拉夫到华沙来度周末的。这种情形在波兰是很常见的。比如在华沙，每个星期日都有成群结队的来自波兰各地的旅行者。他们之中有些人是在星期六晚上搭火车，一觉睡到华沙下车。痛痛快快地玩上一个休息天后，晚上再搭火车向后转。那群来自伏罗兹拉夫的青年就是在那天晚上八时才登车动身回家的。
    蛛网一样密布着的铁路网把波兰全国的大小城镇都联结了起来，这使得全国人民都有充分利用铁路交通的可能。在人民波兰三十一万多平方公里的面积上，纵横延伸着二万五千公里长的（主要是双轨）铁路线（其中有四百五十多公里已经电气化了），平均每一百平方公里土地上有十公里铁路。波兰在铁路工业和铁路交通方面有较长久的历史传统和技术经验。因为波兰是欧洲煤产量很大的国家，所以早在十九世纪中叶在波兰就已开始修建铁路了。同时，波兰位置在欧洲大陆的正中央，假如在欧洲大陆的彼此相距最远的边沿之间都划上直线，那就会看到：这些直线的交叉点都在华沙附近。因此波兰的铁路交通具有重大的国际意义。从巴黎到莫斯科和从北欧到巴尔干各国最近便的陆路线就是通过华沙。华沙是波兰最大的铁路联结点，有九条铁路通达波兰各地和欧洲各部。铁路又是人民波兰最主要的运输工具，它每年的客货载运量占全国总量的85％。人民波兰成立十二年来新建的铁路虽然只占原有线路的25％，但去年铁路载运的客货总量却为战前的三倍半。按人口计算，波兰铁路每年的货运量为欧洲第一，客运量在瑞士之后为欧洲第二。以1955年出售的客票数目计算，波兰每人平均共乘了三十七次火车。
    回顾一下战争刚结束时的景象，便可明白这些成就是在怎样困难的情况下取得的。老铁路工人雅奈克同志对我说：“现在，你可以不下火车走遍全波兰的大城和小镇。但假如你是1945年在波兰旅行的话，那就对不起得很，几乎在每条线上都要请你下车步行走过那被破坏了的桥梁和地段。因为我们的铁路路基在战争中被毁了一万多公里，破坏了的桥梁共有七十多公里长，有二千台机车不能开动！”
    波兰铁路职工们就是在这个破烂底子上重建和发展了铁路交通并使它具有世界先进的水平的。为了表扬铁路职工的忘我劳动和成就，政府在1954年决定每年9月份的第二个星期日为铁路工人节。去年铁路工人们在过节时，共有一万一千多名先进工作者获得了政府的勋章和奖章。波兰铁路职工在节省燃煤和提高铁路运输力方面的成就最为显著。技术革新和劳动组织的改进，使得在不断增加客货载运量的情况下，火车的耗煤量仍能日益减少，并大大提高了运输能力。今年火车的耗煤定额比1949年少两百五十万吨，这足够全波兰火车冬季烧用三个月。但今年的客货运输任务却比1949年多得多。
    人民波兰的铁路工业现在已能制造全套的铁路设备了。在铁路工厂中近年来制造的电气机车、柴油机车和新型的内燃机车共有二十多种。其中“TY—51”型机车在国际竞赛中曾被评为最优良的机车之一。铁路设备是人民波兰重要的出口物资，在波兰出口货中仅次于煤和轮船而居第三位。波兰的机车和各种车厢远销到亚非各国。
    铁路是波兰的大动脉。铁路运输和铁路工业的发达，对于战后波兰工业和整个国民经济的迅速发展起了重要的作用。　九月寄自华沙
