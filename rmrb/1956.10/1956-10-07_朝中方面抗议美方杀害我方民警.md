Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th. At yesterday's meeting of the Secretaries of both sides of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, the Secretary of the Korean-Chinese side sternly protested the U.S. side's violation of the Armistice Agreement and the provocative act of shooting and killing a policeman on the Korean-Chinese side near the Military Demarcation Line on September 20th.

The true circumstances of this incident created by the U.S. side have been confirmed by on-site investigations by personnel from both sides. However, the U.S. side has repeatedly and unreasonably insisted that the Korean-Chinese side fired first, attempting to evade responsibility for this provocative incident.

    朝中方面抗议美方杀害我方民警
    据新华社平壤6日电　在昨天举行的朝鲜军事停战委员会双方秘书长会议上，朝中方面秘书长严正抗议美方违反停战协定，9月20日在军事分界线附近枪杀朝中方面一名民警的挑衅行为。
    美方制造的这次事件的真实情况已经为双方人员进行现场调查所证实。但美方反而一再无理地硬说是朝中方面首先开枪的，企图逃避这次挑衅事件的责任。
