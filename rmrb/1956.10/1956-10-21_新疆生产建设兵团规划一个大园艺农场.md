    Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Plans a Large Horticultural Farm

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps has planned a modern horticultural farm, currently the largest in our country, in the renowned Korla pear producing area. Because this farm is located west of Korla, on the upper reaches of the Kongque River (Peacock River), it is named the Kongque No. 1 Farm. The total area of the farm is more than 130,000 mu, of which more than 60,000 mu are arable. According to preliminary plans, after the farm is established, it can produce more than 100.29 million jin of various vegetables and more than 11.7 million jin of various fruits and grapes each year. In addition to orchards and vegetable gardens, this horticultural farm also has dairy farms, chicken and duck farms, etc. The plan is to develop the cattle herd to 2,000 head, the pig herd to 10,000 head, and the chicken and duck population to 10,000. The fruits produced by the farm will not only be sold in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, but also be supplied to domestic and foreign markets in large quantities. The planning of this farm was carried out under the personal guidance of Soviet experts Comrades Maslov, Beliaev, and Zhelezov.

    新疆生产建设兵团规划一个大园艺农场
    本报讯　新疆军区生产建设兵团在驰名的库尔勒梨产地规划了一个我国目前最大的现代化园艺农场。这个农场因位于库尔勒以西孔雀河上游，故名为孔雀第一农场。该场总面积为十三万多亩，其中可耕面积为六万多亩。据初步计划农场定型后，每年可产各种蔬菜一亿零二百九十多万斤，各种水果、葡萄一千一百七十多万斤。这个园艺农场除有果园、菜园外，并设有奶牛场、鸡鸭场等。牛计划发展到两千头、猪一万头，鸡鸭一万只。农场出产的水果除供销新疆维吾尔自治区外，还可大量供应国内外。这个农场是在苏联专家马斯洛夫、别里捷夫、日列佐夫同志亲自指导下规划的。
