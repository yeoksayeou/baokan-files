Xinhua News Agency, October 6th dispatch from New York: The United Nations Security Council began discussing the Suez Canal issue on October 5th, with the meeting presided over by French Foreign Minister Pineau.

    The meeting first passed the suggestion of Yugoslavian Foreign Secretary Popovic, agreeing to discuss at the next meeting the requests of Israel and seven Arab nations to participate in the discussion of the Suez issue.

    British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, in his speech, insisted on the principle of "international control" of the canal, infringing upon Egyptian sovereignty. He emphasized that the Security Council should safeguard what he called the "rule of law," and demanded that the Security Council lay a foundation for negotiations to "lead to the restoration of an international administration of the Suez Canal."

    Lloyd admitted that the Suez Canal "is subject to Egyptian sovereignty" and geographically it "is part of Egypt." However, he said that did not give Egypt the right to "destroy" the existing "international rights." Lloyd said on the one hand, "We have no dispute over the right of nationalization itself. Most countries have nationalized enterprises in their territories, and this is not a problem." However, he also said that the Egyptian government cannot ask the user nations to "accept a purely Egyptian canal management organization, nor can it ask them to pay tolls to this organization." Lloyd also insisted that user nations have the right to "form their own associations to guarantee their rights of navigation."

    The Foreign Secretary then presented the Anglo-French proposal. The proposal demanded that the Security Council endorse the eighteen-nation proposal on "international control" of the canal as the basis for negotiations with Egypt, and demanded that the Security Council advise Egypt to "cooperate" with the "User Association" before the negotiations reach a result.

    The proposal put forward five matters for the Security Council to take action on:

    "(1) To reaffirm the principle of free navigation of the Suez Canal as provided for in the 1888 Suez Canal Convention;

    "(2) To consider that the rights enjoyed by all users of the Suez Canal under the system that forms the basis of the 1888 Suez Canal Convention should be safeguarded and that the necessary guarantees should be restored;

    "(3) To endorse the eighteen-nation proposal as adequate to facilitate the adjustment and resolution of the Suez Canal issue by peaceful means and in accordance with principles of justice;

    "(4) To recommend that the Egyptian Government cooperate through negotiations to formulate a management system applicable to the Suez Canal on the basis of these proposals;

    "(5) To recommend that the Egyptian Government cooperate with the Suez Canal User Association pending the outcome of such negotiations."

    Pineau spoke after Lloyd. Pineau put on the face of a colonialist, saying that there was "no question of compromise measures." He said that if one admitted that a young country could unilaterally revoke its unequal obligations, it would give "anarchy" and "chaos" a foothold in international relations.

    Dulles gave a brief speech at the end. He will support the Anglo-French proposal and said that he agreed with the eighteen-nation "international control" canal proposal drafted in London.

    The Security Council meeting adjourned after Dulles' speech. The next meeting is scheduled for October 8th.

### 安理会开始讨论苏伊士问题  劳埃德提出英法联合提案坚持侵犯埃及主权

    安理会开始讨论苏伊士问题
    劳埃德提出英法联合提案坚持侵犯埃及主权
    据新华社6日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会10月5日开始讨论苏伊士运河问题，会议由法国外交部长比诺主持。
    会议首先通过了南斯拉夫外交秘书长波波维奇的建议，同意在下次会议上讨论以色列和七个阿拉伯国家参加苏伊士问题讨论的要求。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德在发言中坚持侵犯埃及主权的“国际管理”运河的原则。他强调安全理事会要维护他所谓的“法治”，并且要求安全理事会奠定一个谈判基础来“导致苏伊士运河的国际管理制度的恢复”。
    劳埃德承认苏伊士运河“是受埃及主权支配的”，在地理上它“是埃及的一部分”。但是，他又说，那并没有赋予埃及“破坏”存在着的“国际权利”的权利。劳埃德一方面说，“我们对国有化的权利本身并无争执。大多数国家都曾经把它们领土上的企业收归国有，这一点也是不成问题的”。可是，他又说，埃及政府不可以要求各使用国“接受一个纯粹是埃及的运河管理机构，也不可以要求它们向这个机构交纳通行费。”劳埃德还硬说各使用国有权“成立它们自己的协会来保障自己的通航权利”。
    这位外交大臣接着提出了英法提案。提案要求安理会赞同用十八国关于“国际管制”运河的建议作为同埃及谈判的基础，并且要求安全理事会建议埃及在谈判获得结果以前同“使用国协会”“合作”。
    提案提出了要安全理事会采取行动的五个事项：
    “（一）重申根据1888年苏伊士运河公约所规定的苏伊士运河自由通航的原则；
    “（二）认为所有苏伊士运河的使用国根据作为1888年苏伊士运河公约的基础的制度所享有的权利应该加以保障，而且必要的保证应予恢复；
   “（三）赞同十八国的建议，认为它足以促使苏伊士运河问题通过和平方法并按照公正原则得到调整和解决；
    “（四）建议埃及政府通过谈判来进行合作，在现在这些建议的基础上拟订出一套适用于苏伊士运河的管理制度；
    “（五）建议埃及政府在这种谈判获得结果以前与苏伊士运河使用国协会合作。”
    比诺继劳埃德之后发言。比诺摆出一副殖民主义者的面孔说，采取“妥协措施是谈不到的”。他说，如果承认一个年青国家单方面撤销它的不平等的义务的话，就会使“无政府”和“混乱”在国际关系中有了立足之点。
    杜勒斯最后作了简短发言。他将支持英法提案，并且说，他赞同在伦敦拟订的十八国“国际管制”运河的建议。
    安全理事会会议在杜勒斯发言后休会。下次会议定10月8日举行。
