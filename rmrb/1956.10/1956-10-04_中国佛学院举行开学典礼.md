Xinhua News Agency. The China Buddhist Academy held its opening ceremony in Beijing on the morning of September 28th. The International Buddhist Monks Delegation, currently visiting China, was invited to attend the opening ceremony.

The China Buddhist Academy is sponsored by the Buddhist Association of China. It is located in the Fayuan Temple, which was built more than 1,300 years ago and has recently been renovated. This academy is the largest Buddhist research institution in China's history.

A religious ceremony was held before the opening ceremony. Master Xirao Gyatso, President of the Buddhist Association of China and President of the China Buddhist Academy, presented a Hada before the Buddha statue, and Vice President Master Fazun lit incense and bowed in worship. More than fifty members of the Tibetan visiting group also presented Hadas before the Buddha statue.

Master Xirao Gyatso said in his speech at the opening ceremony that the establishment of the China Buddhist Academy is inseparable from the efforts of eminent monks in the country and the strong support given by the government in accordance with its policy of protecting religious freedom. He also said: "Today, if we want the great teachings of the Buddha to shine on the world and emit light of compassion, peace, and equality, it is urgently necessary for Buddhist circles of all countries to help and cooperate with each other."

He Chengxiang, Director of the Religious Affairs Bureau of the State Council, expressed warm congratulations on the establishment of the Buddhist Academy at the opening ceremony. He said that the Religious Affairs Bureau will continue to provide assistance and support to the Buddhist Academy in the future.

Venerable Ananda Kausalayayana, head of the International Buddhist Monks Delegation from India, offered friendly congratulations to the Buddhist Academy in his speech at the opening ceremony. He said that exchanges between Buddhists in Asian countries have existed since ancient times, but unfortunately, they were interrupted for a considerable period due to foreign colonialism. He then said, "We are pleased that this hateful colonialism has been swept away in most parts of the world. We believe that in the near future, colonialism will become a relic of history." Venerable Ananda expressed his hope that Buddhist circles from all countries would strengthen cooperation with Chinese Buddhist circles. He said that such international cooperation would benefit all those who cherish the cause of Buddhism.

Also attending today's opening ceremony were Zhang Ce, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council, Wang Feng and Yang Jingren, Deputy Directors of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, representatives from the Islamic, Christian, Catholic, and Taoist communities, more than one hundred students of the Buddhist Academy, and Buddhist believers.

U Hla Maw, Ambassador of Burma to China, R.K. Nehru, Ambassador of India to China, Zhou Liang, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Yang An, head of the Cambodian Economic Delegation, were also invited to attend the opening ceremony and the religious ceremony before the opening ceremony.
