    Speaking of Traditional Chinese Painting
    Wu Sun
    Recently, a traditional Chinese painter loudly appealed for "How much is the labor of a traditional Chinese painter worth?" I sympathize with this appeal and hope it will be effective.
    In recent years, although traditional Chinese painting has been supported and promoted by some, its fate seems to be consistently unfavorable. I am not very clear about the situation elsewhere, but judging from Hangzhou alone, the scene is somewhat desolate. The most common place to see traditional Chinese paintings is at the second-hand stalls near Zhong'an Bridge, where traditional Chinese paintings, which have long been mounted and framed and have flowed out of old scholarly families, are often sold cheaply. However, passers-by mostly hurry past, with little interest. As time goes by, even the number of sellers has decreased. Recently, a professor lamented the loss of traditional Chinese paintings, the lack of successors in the traditional Chinese painting world, and the fact that many students are unwilling to study traditional Chinese painting, considering it a feudal relic; ordinary people are also unwilling to hang traditional Chinese paintings, fearing that hanging them will make them look like landlords. His lament is not without reason.
    We are not "national essence" advocates. I advocate learning from the advanced things of foreign countries, not only now but also in the distant future. But if anyone forgets their ancestors, forgets the soil and climate of their own country while learning from foreign things, I don't think that would be a good citizen—he would be more like a "spendthrift." Unfortunately, this kind of behavior does exist. In recent years, we have not only constantly heard the cry that "traditional Chinese painting is not scientific," but even traditional song and dance programs that are deeply loved by the masses have had their graceful movements cut off and foreign ballet embedded in them, making them only allowed to dance but not sing, turning them into a hybrid.
    But it is worth noting that many of our international friends cherish our national artistic traditions. They also often offer some golden words of advice. For example, the Soviet artist Chulaki praised our dance "Plum Blossom in Snow," and the British printmaker Klein, the Belgian Professor Henri Lavachery, and the Uruguayan sculptor and printmaker Maria Carmen also advised us to cherish the beautiful styles and techniques of painting that are entirely Chinese.
    These words are worth pondering by those who blindly follow foreign dogma.
    Of course, we must oppose arrogance. We have no reason to be satisfied with gongs and drums and "Guangling Melody," nor do we have reason to be satisfied with the Dunhuang Grottoes and the freehand paintings of later literati. We should dare to absorb foreign things, dare to innovate, and dare to create, but unlike all those with a "spendthrift" spirit, our heels must be rooted in the land of China.

    从国画说开去
    伍隼
    最近一位国画家为“国画家的劳动值多少钱”而大声呼吁。我同情这一呼吁，并且希望它能收到效果。
    近几年来，国画虽然有人扶植，有人鼓吹，但命运仿佛总不见得好似的。别地的情形我不很了然，单以杭州来看，光景就多少有点冷落。最常见到国画的地方是众安桥畔的旧货摊，这里常常有从旧日的书香门第流散出来的、早就裱糊好的国画在廉价兜售。但行人大抵匆匆而过，很少有什么兴致。日子一久，连兜售的人也少下去了。最近一位教授慨然于国画的散失，慨然于国画界的继起乏人，还慨然于目前许多学生不愿学国画，认为国画是封建遗物；老百姓也不愿挂国画，怕挂了国画会被人看作地主。他的慨叹不是无因的。
    我们不是“国粹派”，我的是主张学习外国的进步的东西的，不仅现在，而且直到久远的将来。但假如有谁在学习外国的东西的时候竟然忘掉了祖先，忘掉了本国的土壤和气候，我看那也决不是好公民，——他倒更近乎“败家子”。可惜，这种作风是确实有的。这些年来，我们不仅时时听到“国画不科学”的嚷嚷之声，就是深为广大群众所喜爱的传统歌舞节目吧，有的也竟被砍去优美的动作，嵌上外来的芭蕾，弄得只准舞而不准歌，成了四不像。
    但可以注意的是，我们的不少国际友人倒是珍视我们的民族艺术传统的。他们还时时送来一些金玉良言。譬如，苏联的艺术家楚拉基就赞美过我们的舞蹈“雪里梅”，英国的版画家卡来因、比利时的亨利·拉瓦舍利教授、乌拉圭的雕塑和铜版画家玛丽雅·卡尔梅女士也都劝过我们爱惜绘画上那些全然中国风的优美的格调和技法。
    这些话是值得搬弄洋教条的人好好想一想的。
    当然，我们必须反对自大狂。我们没有理由满足于铙钹锣鼓和“广陵散”，也没有理由满足于敦煌石窟和后代文人的写意画。我们是应该敢于吸收外来的东西，也敢于革新，敢于创造的，可是和一切有“败家子”气的人们不同，我们的足跟必须落在中国的土地上。
