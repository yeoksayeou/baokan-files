	The Yellow Explosive That Didn't Explode
	——Record of the Arrest of a Kuomintang Special Agent Explosives Expert in Hong Kong
	
	On the Pearl River in Guangzhou, around 10 PM on October 3rd, a young couple checked into a passenger boat. The man carried an old rattan suitcase, and the woman had a large leather trunk. They were both dressed plainly. They had both arrived from Hong Kong on the train that morning and sought out these inconspicuous passenger boats for lodging. Four small blocks of highly explosive yellow dynamite, wrapped in cloth and shaped like a "menstrual belt," were tightly strapped to the woman, named Deng Shuyi, near her genitals. The man, Zhou Hanqin, carried a detonator, a fuse, and a packet of secret writing powder.

	Zhou Hanqin, acting on orders from the Hong Kong Kuomintang special agent command, was to use the explosives they brought to detonate a car next to the Ai Qun Mansion in Guangzhou, where many international friends often stayed, between 7:30 and 8 PM on October 10th. Before Zhou Hanqin left, his special agent superior specifically instructed him: "You must succeed and return!"

	However, the Kuomintang special agents' "strength" didn't even have the chance to be "flaunted," and Zhou Hanqin and Deng Shuyi were already thrown into jail!

	Zhou Hanqin and Deng Shuyi only stayed on the small boat for one night. The next day, they each found relatives' homes that they considered easier to hide in. Not long after settling their luggage, Zhou Hanqin hurriedly took Deng Shuyi to "reconnoiter the terrain" near the Ai Qun Mansion.

	According to Zhou Hanqin's later confession: He planned to carry the yellow dynamite on his person between 7:30 and 8 PM on October 10th. When he walked to a place near the Ai Qun Mansion where many cars were parked, he would pretend that his shoelace was untied and bend down to tie it, taking the opportunity to light the fuse of the dynamite with a match, and then place the dynamite under a car to explode. The special agent Zhou Hanqin also took Deng Shuyi to Huanghuagang, Yuexiu Park, the Taiping Theater, and many other public places to scout around. Zhou Hanqin also confessed that if he couldn't make a move at the Ai Qun Mansion, he would explode the famous Victory Mansion in Shamian.

	This special agent, Zhou Hanqin, joined the special agent organization in Hong Kong this spring. For several months, his special agent superior had given him specialized explosives training in Hong Kong, and he had also practiced explosives there. He also learned a set of special agent activities, such as how to tail people. This time, when his special agent superior sent him to Guangzhou, he placed great hopes on him, saying that after completing the "mission," he would "reward" him well and send him to Taiwan for training.

	After Zhou Hanqin and Deng Shuyi returned to Guangzhou, while actively "reconnoitering the terrain" and making other preparations, they became carried away with drinking, watching plays, and enjoying boat rides on Lychee Bay. They did not expect that at this time, the vigilant eyes of the people were closely watching their every move, and they had already been caught in a dragnet.

	Chen Bo, a salesman at the Xidi Department Store in Guangzhou, was Deng Shuyi's lover before liberation. At around 4 PM on October 5th, Chen Bo's old flame, after many years of separation, suddenly appeared in front of his counter. This sudden reunion surprised and delighted Chen Bo. That evening, he talked with this old flame from Hong Kong. However, the more Chen Bo talked, the more he felt that something was wrong. Deng Shuyi said to Chen Bo, "Your future here is very bleak!" Chen Bo quickly realized that the person standing in front of him was no longer the pure girl he had thought she was, but might be a vicious enemy. The next day, Deng Shuyi even took the special agent Zhou Hanqin to see Chen Bo, falsely claiming that Zhou was her nephew. But during the outing, all the suspicious actions of these two guys were seen by Chen Bo.

	Chen Bo reported everything in detail to the public security organs.

	After careful investigation and collecting materials from various sources, the public security organs confirmed that Zhou Hanqin was indeed a special agent sent by the Hong Kong Kuomintang special agent organization, and Deng Shuyi was there to participate in his special agent activities.

	After obtaining the approval of the procuratorial organs, they arrested them three days before they were scheduled to carry out the explosion. At the same time, in Zhou Hanqin's residence, they found the four packets of explosives, a detonator, and a fuse that they had brought back from Hong Kong. Zhou Hanqin later confessed that the yellow dynamite was placed near Deng Shuyi's genitals when they brought it back, and he carried the other explosives himself. This carefully planned explosives conspiracy, like many explosives conspiracies that the Kuomintang special agent organization had long planned to carry out in Guangzhou on October 10th, was thus completely smashed.

    没有爆炸的黄色炸药
    ——香港国民党特务爆破手被捕记
    新华社记者　方力
    广州市珠江河面的一个客艇上，10月3日晚上十点钟左右来了一对年青的男女住客。男的拿着一个旧藤匧，女的带着一个大皮箱。两人的装扮都很平常。他们两人都是这一天早晨从香港乘火车上来，而找到这些不很受人注意的客艇来住宿的。四小块烈性的黄色炸药，被用布包着并做成“月经带”的样子，紧紧绑在名叫邓淑仪的这个女人的靠近阴部的地方。男的周汉勤的身上带着一个雷管、一条导火索和一包密写粉。
    周汉勤奉香港国民党特务指挥机关的命令，要在10月10日晚上七点半到八点钟利用他们带来的炸药，爆炸广州市经常住着大批国际友人的爱群大厦旁边的汽车。周汉勤临走以前，他的特务上司还特别嘱咐他：“无论如何要成功返回！”
    但是，国民党特务的“力量”还没有机会“炫耀”出来，周汉勤和邓淑仪就已经被抓进牢狱里去了！
    周汉勤和邓淑仪在这个小艇上只住了一夜，第二天就各自找到了他们认为比较容易隐蔽自己的亲戚家里去住宿。他们安顿好行李没有多久，周汉勤就急急忙忙带着邓淑仪一道去爱群大厦附近“侦察地形”。
    据周汉勤后来供认：他预定在10月10日晚上七点半到八点钟之间，将黄色炸药带在身上，在走到爱群大厦旁边停着很多汽车的地方的时候，就假装成为鞋带松脱要绑鞋带，弯下身来乘机用火柴点着炸药的导火索，然后就把炸药放到汽车底下爆炸。特务分子周汉勤还带着邓淑仪一道到黄花岗、越秀公园、太平戏院等许多公共场所察看了一遍。周汉勤还供认，要是在爱群大厦下不了手，他将要爆炸沙面著名的胜利大厦。
    周汉勤这个特务分子，是今年春天在香港参加特务组织的。几个月以来，他的特务上司曾在香港对他进行过专门的爆破训练，他并且在这地方进行过爆破实习，他也学到了如何跟踪人等一套特务活动知识。这次，他的特务上司派他来广州的时候，对他曾寄予极大的希望，表示在完成“任务”以后，要好好的“奖赏”他，并送他去台湾受训练。”
    周汉勤和邓淑仪回到广州后，在积极“侦察地形”和进行其他准备工作的同时，竟也就得意忘形地饮酒看戏，到荔枝湾上乘艇作乐。他们没有想到，就在这个时候，人民群众的警觉的眼睛已严密地注视着他们的一举一动，他们已投进了天罗地网。
    广州市西堤百货商店的一个售货员陈波，解放前曾经是邓淑仪的情人，10月5日下午四点多钟，陈波的这个旧情人在隔别多年以后，突然在他的货柜面前出现了。这一突如其来的会面使陈波又惊又喜。当晚，他和这个来自香港的旧情人谈起来了。但是，愈谈陈波就愈感到不对头，邓淑仪对陈波说：“你在这里的前途是很悲观的！”陈波很快感觉到，站在他面前的这个人已经不是过去他所认为的纯洁的少女，而可能是一个凶恶的敌人了。第二天，邓淑仪还带着特务分子周汉勤一道去看陈波，假说周是她的外甥。但在游览中这两个家伙的一切可疑行动都被陈波看在眼里了。
    陈波把一切情况都详细报告给公安机关。
    公安机关经过缜密的侦查和多方面搜集材料，证实周汉勤确实是香港国民党特务机关派遣来的特务分子，邓淑仪是一道来参加他的特务活动的。
    在得到检察机关的批准后，便在他们预定进行爆炸的前三天把他们逮捕起来。同时在周汉勤住的地方，搜出了他们从香港带回来的四包炸药、一个雷管、一条导火索。周汉勤后来供认：黄色炸药带回来的时候是放在邓淑仪的靠近阴部的地方，其他的爆炸物是他自己带的。这一个经过周密布置的爆破阴谋计划，像国民党特务机关老早就预定10月10日在广州进行的许多宗爆破阴谋计划一样，就这样被彻底粉碎了。
