Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 23rd: Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi said in Cairo yesterday that Egypt had not yet reached an agreement with Britain and France on the date and location for negotiations on the Suez Canal issue.

Fawzi pointed out that the West's demand that Egypt put forward concrete proposals for renegotiation based on these proposals was a "delaying tactic." He said that the proposals put forward by Egypt were already more than sufficient to start negotiations.

Fawzi made these remarks after meeting with President Nasser. It is reported that they discussed the Suez Canal issue and the United Nations Security Council's call for further negotiations.

Fawzi returned to Cairo on October 22nd after attending the United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss the Suez Canal issue.

    西方国家借故拖延英法埃谈判时间地点未定
    新华社23日讯　开罗消息：埃及外交部部长法齐昨天在开罗说，埃及还没有同英法就苏伊士运河问题谈判日期和地点达成协议。
    法齐指出，西方要求埃及提出具体建议以便根据这些建议重行会谈是“拖延手段”。他说，埃及提出的建议已经超过足以开始谈判的程度。
    法齐在说这番话之前，会晤了纳赛尔总统。据报道，他们讨论了苏伊士运河问题以及联合国安全理事会号召进一步谈判等事项。
    法齐在参加联合国安全理事会讨论苏伊士运河问题的会议后，在10月22日回到了开罗。
