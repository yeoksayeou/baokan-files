    Jiangsu Provincial Department of Commerce Takes Measures
    to Improve Working and Labor Conditions in Retail Stores

    (Our Dispatch) In order to improve the work of state-owned retail stores, mobilize the enthusiasm of the majority of salespersons, and do a good job in market supply during the peak season, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Commerce convened a retail work symposium for twenty cities and counties from September 20th to 26th. The meeting focused on problems such as excessively long working hours for salespersons, high rates of illness, high job turnover, low professional skills of salespersons, excessive paperwork, and poor operating equipment, labor conditions, and employee benefits in stores.

    In order to effectively solve the above problems, the Department of Commerce has decided to take the following specific measures and methods. Resolutely implement the "continuous shift system" and the "staggered rotation system," and organize salesperson labor rationally according to the busy and slack seasons to improve labor efficiency. Simplify systems and reports. Abolish the handover system for most commodities and establish a collective responsibility system for groups to promote mutual supervision and collectivism. Gradually create conditions to implement a multi-day accounting system for groups to change the phenomenon of excessively long accounting times for salespersons. Streamline meetings and establish necessary meeting systems; meetings should generally not occupy salespersons' rest and leisure time.

    According to actual needs and possibilities, appropriately increase operating equipment, improve employee labor conditions, and establish necessary welfare facilities such as nursing rooms, nurseries, women's hygiene rooms, rest rooms, and entertainment venues.

    Regarding the issue of compensation for salespersons' errors in goods and payments, resolutely implement the decision of the Ministry of Commerce: generally, the method of compensation should not be adopted. We should start from strengthening the political education of salespersons, inspiring their enthusiasm, summarizing experiences and lessons, helping salespersons improve their work, plug loopholes, and prevent errors.

    In addition, the Provincial Department of Commerce has made regulations on the cultivation of salespersons and the frequent transfer of work. (Zhang Yingjie)

    江苏省商业厅采取措施
    改善零售店工作和劳动条件
    本报讯　江苏省商业厅为了改善国营零售商店的工作，调动广大营业员的积极性，做好旺季市场供应工作，于9月20日至26日召开了二十个市县的零售工作座谈会。会上集中反映了营业员劳动时间过长，生病人多，工作流动性大，营业员业务水平不高；报表繁多，商店营业设备、劳动条件和职工福利的情况不好等问题。
    商业厅为了切实地解决上述问题，决定采取如下的具体措施和办法。坚决贯彻“连带上班制”和“交叉轮休制”，按照营业忙闲规律，合理地组织营业员劳动，以提高劳动效率。简化制度和表报等。大部分商品取消交接制度，建立小组集体负责制，以发挥相互监督作用和集体主义精神。逐步创造条件，以便实行小组多日结账制，改变营业员结账时间过长的现象。精简会议，建立必要的会议制度，会议一般不能占用营业员休息和业余活动时间。
    根据实际需要和可能，适当增加营业设备，改善职工劳动条件，兴办必要的福利事业，如哺乳室、托儿所、女工卫生室、休息室、娱乐场所等。
    对营业员的错货错款的赔偿问题，坚决贯彻商业部决定，一般不采取赔偿的办法，应该从加强营业员的政治教育，启发营业员的积极性出发，总结经验教训，帮助营业员改进工作，堵塞漏洞，防止差错的发生。
    此外，关于营业员的培养问题，关于工作调动频繁问题等，省商业厅都作了规定。　（张英杰）
