From sowing to harvest, there is always a growing period, no matter what the crop. From novice to expert, there is always a period of time for learning and training, no matter what kind of talent.

As for the need to sow before harvesting, and the need for apprentices before having skilled master craftsmen, this goes without saying.

However, there are such things:

The Tianjin Bicycle Factory received a task from its superiors to train and transfer complete sets of cadres for a new factory; however, the personnel quota was tightly controlled according to current production needs, with no room for even one extra person. With this kind of "only out, no in" approach, the factory asks the higher-level leading organs, how are they supposed to complete the task of transferring cadres?

The Beijing No. 3 Machine Tool Factory is recruiting new workers. Someone blamed the factory director: "You are a female factory director, why do you still despise women and are unwilling to recruit female workers?" The factory director said: "Female workers have children, and they have to take maternity leave before and after childbirth, which is stipulated in the labor protection regulations. However, who will replace them during the leave period?" They also want the factory to recruit female workers, but don't provide a reserve quota in the personnel allocation. The factory asks the higher-level leading organs, how are they supposed to implement the policy of equality between men and women?

Giving tasks also requires giving conditions. It is a good idea to "want the horse to run, but not want the horse to eat grass," but unfortunately, it doesn't work.

    官僚主义之一种
  　石六鸣
    从播种到收获，总要有一个生长期，不管是什么庄稼。从生手到内行，也总要有一段时间来学习，培养，不管是什么人才。
    至于，要收获必须先播种，要有熟练的老师傅必须先有人学徒，这更是用不着说的。
    然而，却有这样的事：
    天津自行车厂接到上级给的任务，要为新厂培养和输送成套的干部；然而，人员定额却按目前生产需要扣得紧紧的，多一个都不行。像这样只出不进的做法，请问上级领导机关，叫下面的工厂如何完成输送干部的任务？
    北京第三机床厂正在招收新工人。有人责备厂长：“你是个女厂长，为什么还轻视女性，不愿意招收女工？”厂长说：“女工生孩子，产前产后要休假，这是劳保条例上规定的。但是，休假期间谁来代替她们工作呢？”又要厂里招收女工，在人员编制当中又不给规定预备定额，请问上级领导机关，叫下面工厂如何贯彻执行男女一视同仁的政策？
    给任务也要给条件。“又要马儿跑，又要马儿不吃草”，这种打算固然很好，可惜行不通。
