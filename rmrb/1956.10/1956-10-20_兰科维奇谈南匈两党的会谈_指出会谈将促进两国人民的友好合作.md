Xinhua News Agency, 19th. According to a report by the Yugoslav News Agency, Ranković, Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, told reporters from the Yugoslav News Agency on the 18th that the talks between the delegation of the League of the Communists of Yugoslavia and the delegation of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party were conducted in a friendly and candid atmosphere. Ranković recalled that the necessary conditions had been created in both countries for holding such talks; these talks would help establish cooperation and promote relations between the two parties and between the people of Hungary and Yugoslavia.

Ranković said that during the talks, the representatives of the two parties studied issues related to cooperation between the two parties, as well as certain issues related to relations and economic ties between the two countries.

Ranković said: "Based on the desires expressed by both sides, discussions were held on the experiences gained by both countries in building socialism. The Hungarian comrades were particularly interested in Yugoslavia's economic system, worker-managed enterprises, and the commune system. Ranković continued by saying that members of the Hungarian Working People's Party delegation had expressed the hope to send a delegation to Yugoslavia to study the economic system and the work and organizational structures of various social organizations—particularly the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Socialist Alliance of Working People—in greater detail.
