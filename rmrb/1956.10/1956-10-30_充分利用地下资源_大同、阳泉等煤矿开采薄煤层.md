Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 28th - The four state-owned coal mines in Shanxi Province: Datong, Yangquan, Xuangang, and Fenxi, have successively begun mining thin coal seams with thicknesses between 0.7 meters and 1.3 meters. In the past, these thin coal seams were left unmined underground in the Shanxi area. Now that they are being mined, according to Yangquan Coal Mine statistics alone, the original mining area of the entire mine has increased by 95.56 million tons of mineable reserves for civilian use, which is equivalent to 36 times the coal production of the mine last year.

In the past, state-owned coal mines in Shanxi Province did not mine thin coal seams, partly because some cadres did not pay enough attention to the full utilization of resources, and also because the working conditions for mining thin coal seams were relatively harsh and the costs were relatively high. With the development of national economic construction, the demand for coal in various aspects has increased day by day, requiring all coal mines to mine all possible coal. At the same time, the degree of mechanization of state-owned coal mines in Shanxi Province has been significantly improved in the past few years, and many laborious coal mining and transportation tasks have been replaced by mechanical operations, which has created favorable conditions for improving the working conditions for mining thin coal seams. Therefore, these coal mines began the work of mining thin coal seams.

Currently, state-owned coal mines in Shanxi Province are also incorporating the mining of thin coal seams into the overall design of new mine shafts in accordance with the requirements of fully utilizing underground resources. After the new mine shafts are put into production, the work of mining thin coal seams in various coal mines can be put on a normal track. At that time, hundreds of thousands of tons of coal will be mined from thin coal seams every year.

    充分利用地下资源
    大同、阳泉等煤矿开采薄煤层
    新华社太原28日电　山西省大同、阳泉、轩岗、汾西四个国营煤矿，先后开始采掘厚度在零点七公尺到一点三公尺之间的薄煤层。这些薄煤层过去在山西地区是丢在地下不开采的。现在开采以后，仅据阳泉煤矿统计，全矿的原有矿区中就增加了九千五百六十万吨民用煤的可采储量，等于这个煤矿去年煤产量的三十六倍。
    山西省各国营煤矿过去不开采薄煤层，除了某些干部对充分利用资源不够重视以外，还由于开采薄煤层的劳动条件较苦，成本比较高。随着国家经济建设的发展，各方面对煤炭需要日益增加，要求各煤矿把一切可能开采的煤都开采出来。同时，山西各国营煤矿在过去几年中机械化程度已经有显著提高，许多费力的采煤、运输等工作都已经用机械代替手工操作，也就为改善开采薄煤层的劳动状况创造了良好条件。因此，这些煤矿开始了开采薄煤层的工作。
    现在，山西省各煤矿还正在根据充分利用地下资源的要求，把开采薄煤层列入了新建矿井的总体设计。等新建矿井投入生产以后，各煤矿开采薄煤层的工作，就可以走上正常轨道。那时，每年将有几十万吨煤从薄煤层中开采出来。
