A good film script, a good film
    ——A Brief Discussion of the Film "Blessing" and its Script
    Jin Cao

Everyone says that a film script is the foundation of film art. Obviously, only with a good foundation—a good film script—can we hope for and ensure the production of a good film. However, what constitutes a good foundation? I think we can find the answer in Xia Yan's adaptation of the film script for "Blessing."

"Blessing" is adapted from Lu Xun's novel of the same name. Adaptation is inherently not easy, especially when it comes to adapting Lu Xun's works, which have a broad mass appeal both domestically and internationally, and possess brilliant historical value and artistic achievement. Here, the screenwriter must have a deep understanding of the ideological spirit of Lu Xun's original work and a profound understanding of the era it reflects. Only then can they accurately express the content of the original work in the adapted work. All of this expression must be "cinematic," that is, it must conform to the laws of film creation and meet the requirements of film characteristics. At the same time, the screenwriter must also be familiar with and master the artistic characteristics and unique style of Lu Xun's original work, so that it can be naturally reflected in the future film, allowing the audience to confirm that this is "Lu Xun's" when appreciating the film. Only such a film script is a good foundation for the film.

The work completed by the screenwriter Xia Yan is fundamentally such a work.

This work is a true film literary script. That is: whether it is its narrative part, or its dialogue and scene descriptions, all strictly conform to the basic law of visual perception in film art. What it expresses are concrete and clear "visible" film images. Therefore, readers can have a "screen sense" when reading the script, and can clearly see and hear everything that will be presented on the screen in visual impressions. The scene at the beginning of the script, when Xianglin Sao makes her first appearance, gives people such a feeling, and it can be said that all the descriptions in the script have reached this level. The script not only meticulously writes out the characters' images and actions, but also writes out each frame, each shot, and their continuity and changes; the script is also written very cleanly and concisely, without superfluous embellishments or dragging, and without lengthy dialogues or dull discussions. It follows Lu Xun's descriptive technique, preserving Lu Xun's original conciseness, simplicity, and deeply meaningful implied literary style.

This film script, while faithful to the original work, also makes certain necessary changes and developments to the original work's descriptions, making the plot richer and the story more complete. One aspect is that the essay-style narrative method and essay-style structural arrangement in the novel "Blessing" have been improved and processed to become the straightforward narrative with a beginning and an end that we see in the film now. Another aspect is the bold and successful creation of characters and events that were originally glossed over or only hinted at in the novel, but are very important and indispensable in the film. For example, the most beautiful and moving scene we see in the film—the wedding night of Xianglin Sao and He Laoliu and all the scenes of the next morning immediately following it—are told in the original work through the recounting of Wei's wife to Lu Si's wife and later Xianglin Sao's confession to Liu's mother, but in the script, a more direct description is made. Because of this, He Laoliu's sincere love and meticulous care for Xianglin Sao are expressed. In the many misfortunes of Xianglin Sao that follow, and even in the story of her final tragic destruction, this more strongly highlights Xianglin Sao's deepest sorrow and further enhances people's sympathy for the entirety of Xianglin Sao's fate. …

These are some of the most important achievements of the "Blessing" film script.

As for the film itself, needless to say, it is a good work on the level of our current film art creation, as we have seen. It not only fundamentally and artistically embodies the content provided by the script, but also enriches it in certain parts. The environment and natural scenery around Luzhen and the scenes of the Lu family's several blessings that appear in the film are all very regional in character, and the music in the film is also distinctive.

In this film, the actors become a very good creative collective. They cooperate well and perform very seriously. Among them, the main actors such as Bai Yang, Li Jingbo, Shi Lin, and Wei Heling have left quite clear impressions on the audience in certain aspects. In particular, the image of He Laoliu created by Wei Heling is even more vivid and complete. Although he does not have many "scenes," whether he is quietly standing there when he first appears, or whether he is silently enduring the pain when he later pulls the rope for the landlord, not to mention his actions in treating Xianglin Sao and in dealing with his own destiny, he is always full of "acting"—he profoundly, meticulously and realistically expresses the temperament, character and characteristics of his role, and expresses the inner activities and emotional changes of the character...

Is the film without flaws? I think there are still some. For example, A Xiang - a maid in the Lu Siye family. This character remains the same throughout the entire process of the plot development, which is at least five years, which seems prominent and unbelievable in the film. As for the landlord and his advisor added in the film, their role is only to repeat things that general literary works, including the film itself, have already described several times, such as the poor being forced to borrow money and the landlord forcing debts and harming people. What is the need for this, especially for the embodiment of the ideological spirit of Lu Xun's great works? (Attached picture)

    电影剧本好，影片也好
    ——略谈影片“祝福”及其剧本
    金草
    大家都说，电影剧本是电影艺术的基础，那么很显然，只有有了好的基础——好的电影剧本才可以指望和保证拍摄出好的影片来。然而，怎样才算是好的基础呢？我想从夏衍改编的“祝福”的电影剧本中，可以找到这个答案。
      “祝福”是根据鲁迅的同名小说改编的。改编，本来不是容易的事情；何况又是对具有国内外广泛群众影响的、具有辉煌的历史价值和艺术成就的鲁迅的作品的改编呢，在这里，电影剧作家必须具有对鲁迅原著的思想精神的深刻体会和对其所反映的时代生活的精湛理解，然后才可以把原著的内容准确地在改编的作品中表达出来；而这一切表现，又必须是“电影的”，就是说，必须服从于电影创作的规律，符合电影特性的要求。同时，电影剧作家还必须熟悉和掌握鲁迅原著的艺术特色及其独特的风格，使其在未来的影片中自然而然地体现出来，使观众在欣赏影片的时候确认这是“鲁迅的”，这样的电影剧本才是影片的好的基础。
    剧作家夏衍所完成的根本上是这样一部作品。
    这部作品是真正的电影文学剧本。这就是：不论它的叙述部分，或者它的对话以及情景说明，都是严格地符合于视觉感受这一电影艺术的基本规律的，它所表现了的都是具体而明了的“可视”的电影形象；因而读者在读剧本的时候能有“银幕感”，能在视觉印象中清晰地看见和听见将来要在银幕上呈现出来的一切。剧本一开头，祥林嫂初次出场的情景，就给人这么一种感觉，而剧本的全部描写，可以说，都达到了这样的境地。剧本不但很细致地把人物的形象、动作写出来了，把每个画面、每个镜头以及它们之间的连续和变化写出来了；剧本也写得非常干净、简洁，没有多余的陪衬和拖带，也没有冗长的对话和枯燥的议论。它遵守着鲁迅原著的白描手法，保存了鲁迅原著的简炼，朴素和寓意深远的含蓄的文学风格。
    这个电影剧本，也在忠实于原著的基础上，对原著的描写作了某些必要的更动和发展，使情节更加丰富，故事更加完整。这一方面就是：把小说“祝福”中散文的叙述方式和散文的结构安排，作了改进和加工，成为现在影片中所看见的这样有头有尾的直叙。另一方面就是：把小说中原来一笔带过以至只是暗示的部分，但是在电影中却是十分重要的、必不可少的人物和事件，作了大胆而成功的创造。比如我们在影片中看到的最优美动人的一场戏——祥林嫂和贺老六的结婚之夜以及紧接着的第二天早晨的全部情景，在原著中是通过卫老婆子对鲁四太太的补叙和后来祥林嫂对柳妈的自白交代出来的，但在剧本里面，却作了更直接的描叙。正因为这样，贺老六对祥林嫂的出自至诚的爱惜和体贴入微的深情被表现出来了。这在祥林嫂以后的许多不幸以至最后的惨遭毁灭的故事中，就更加强烈地烘托出祥林嫂最深沉的悲哀，也更增强了人们对于祥林嫂的全部命运的同情。……
    这些，就是“祝福”电影剧本一部分的但是最主要的成就。
    至于影片本身，不用说，一如我们见到的那样，是目前我们电影艺术创作中一部水平线上的好作品。它不但在根本上艺术地体现了剧本所提供了的内容；而且在某些部分还有所丰富。出现在影片中的鲁镇周围的环境和自然景色以及鲁家几次祝福的场面，都很有地方色彩，影片的音乐也是有特色的。
    在这部影片里面，演员成为一个很好的创作集体。他们合作得很好，表演很认真。其中主要演员如白杨、李景波、史林、魏鹤龄等更各在某些方面给观众留下了颇为清晰的印象。特别是魏鹤龄所创造的贺老六的形象，更是鲜明完整。虽然他的“戏”不多，但是不论他初次出场时悄悄站在那里，或者他后来给地主拉纤时默默地隐忍着痛苦的神情，更不论他在对待祥林嫂以及对待自己命运的那些行动中，他身上总是充满了“戏”——他深刻、细致而逼真地表现出了他的角色的气质、品德和性格的特征，表现出了人物的内心活动和感情的变化……
    影片是不是没有瑕疵了呢？我觉得还是有的。比如阿香——鲁四老爷家的一个丫头，这个人物，在戏剧情节展开的全部过程、也就是前后至少五年的过程中，竟然老是一个样儿，这在影片中就显得突出而且令人不能置信了。至于影片中增加的那个地主和他的师爷，其作用也不过是将穷人被逼借债、地主逼债害人这些一般文艺作品，包括影片本身在内的作品已经描写过若干次的东西又重复了一次，这又有什么必要，特别是对于伟大的鲁迅的作品的思想精神的体现，又有什么必要呢？（附图片）
