    The people of our country are today celebrating the seventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with joy and pride.
    On the eve of this year's National Day, the people of our country have basically achieved victory in the socialist revolution. Our country's first Five-Year Plan has achieved significant successes in the past three years and nine months, and the people of the whole country are working hard to overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan next year. Our country is appearing on the stage of Asia and the world as a socialist country full of confidence and strength. Because our motherland is becoming increasingly strong, and because our country has consistently pursued a foreign policy of safeguarding world peace and strengthening friendly cooperation among the people of all countries, the role and influence of our country in international affairs is growing. In this great festival of national jubilation, each of us has reason to be delighted and encouraged by the achievements we have made at home and abroad.
    The recently concluded, historically significant, Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China showed the people of the whole country the bright and splendid future of our motherland. This Congress summarized the experience of our country's socialist cause in the past few years, put forward the basic outline of the second Five-Year Plan, and called on the whole Party to unite as one, and to unite all forces at home and abroad that can be united, to strive to build a great industrialized socialist China.
    The current international situation is favorable to our country's socialist construction. The characteristic of this situation is that the forces striving for and maintaining peace throughout the world are constantly developing and growing, while the forces of aggression and war are constantly weakening and tending towards isolation. The continued development of the international situation in this direction will undoubtedly greatly consolidate world peace and international security, and make lasting world peace possible.
    The existence of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and the rapid growth of their strength and prestige, are a strong guarantee of world peace. The socialist countries of Europe and Asia already have a population of more than 900 million, accounting for one-third of the world's population, and are connected into a powerful world system across more than one-quarter of the world's land, forming a world system that can support each other. Due to the superiority of the socialist system, and the people's high enthusiasm for labor under this system, all socialist countries have achieved remarkable achievements in peaceful construction, and their national economies have achieved tremendous development. Brotherly friendship exists among the socialist countries, forming an unbreakable unity.
    The achievements made by the Chinese people in building socialism are part of the achievements of the entire socialist system. The growth and strengthening of the Chinese people's strength will further strengthen the strength and prestige of the entire socialist system and promote the development of the world peace cause. In the cause of building socialism, the Chinese people have already obtained and will continue to obtain the fraternal assistance of the great Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Constantly consolidating and developing the closest friendly cooperation between our country and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is our country's primary task in international affairs.
    The socialist countries' sympathy and support for the peoples of all countries who oppose colonialism and strive for national independence has greatly encouraged the development and victory of the national independence movement throughout the world since the war. In the eleven years since the war, more than 1.2 billion people, accounting for nearly half of the world's population, have been freed from colonial or semi-colonial status. The nations that are still in an oppressed position are also fighting for independence and freedom. Most of the countries that gained independence after the war, in order to consolidate their independence and develop their economies, oppose joining military blocs and advocate peaceful coexistence. They oppose war and the threat of war, and demand peace. All of this has greatly weakened the imperialist forces and severely cracked down on their conspiracies to incite war and create tension. The development of the world anti-colonialist force is an extremely huge force to guarantee world peace.
    The Chinese people have a deep understanding of the scourge of colonialism and a deep understanding of the desire of countries that have gained independence to maintain their independence. Therefore, the Chinese people resolutely support the struggle for and maintenance of national independence anywhere in the world. We must further develop friendly relations with India, Indonesia, Burma, Nepal, Egypt, Syria, and other peace-loving countries in Asia and Africa on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We firmly support the just stand of Egypt and other Arab countries on the Suez Canal issue, support Indonesia's position of demanding the recovery of West Irian, and support the position of the Algerian people and other colonial people demanding national independence. Supporting the movement against colonialism and striving for and maintaining national independence is to safeguard world peace. We must make full efforts in this regard.
    Another important reason for the change in the balance of power between the forces of peace and the forces of war is the widespread development of the peace movement. The fact that socialist countries are carrying out large-scale peaceful construction and implementing a peaceful foreign policy has made more and more people in the capitalist world see through the anti-communist lies spread by the United States. They realize that in the ten years of cold war of arms expansion and war preparations, all they have gained is poverty, hardship, and heavy military burdens, as well as the danger of being dragged into a new world war by the United States. Now, there are not only vast numbers of workers, peasants, and intellectuals who are demanding arms reduction, banning atomic weapons and nuclear weapons, abolishing embargoes, implementing peaceful coexistence, and expanding economic and cultural exchanges, but also an increasing number of patriotic people in the bourgeoisie of various countries. The development of the movement against war policies and defending peace, with the participation of broad strata, has had a favorable impact on the foreign policies of many countries. More and more countries are unwilling to continue to follow the United States and have adopted a policy of peaceful neutrality, causing signs of disintegration in the military aggression groups organized by the United States around the world.
    We Chinese people will stand together with all peace-loving people to continue to work for arms reduction and the banning of weapons of mass destruction. We will actively develop diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations with other countries and expand friendly exchanges with each other. Mutual contact and visits between government leaders and people of various countries will inevitably enhance international trust and understanding and eliminate the atmosphere of suspicion and distrust spread by international reactionary forces. This is conducive to the cause of consolidating world peace.
    The development of world peace and progressive forces has promoted contradictions within the imperialist bloc, especially between the United States and Britain, the two largest capitalist countries. Under the new international situation, the foreign policies of major capitalist countries are falling into a state of confusion. In the ruling groups of some capitalist countries, in order to get rid of their difficult situation and under the strong pressure of the people, a tendency towards peaceful coexistence has begun to emerge. However, the bellicose groups of imperialism are still trying to find a way out by creating tension and pursuing war policies. Therefore, we must still maintain a high degree of vigilance and strictly guard against the war and provocation conspiracies of imperialism.
    Our cause is just and conforms to the interests of the people of all countries in the world, so our friends are all over the world. Today, celebrating this festival with us in our capital are Indonesian President Sukarno, Nepalese Prime Minister Acharya, delegations from fraternal parties of various countries attending the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, as well as official and non-governmental delegations and well-known people from many countries. They are the embodiment of the friendship and sympathy of the people of all countries towards us. We warmly welcome them and express our deep gratitude and best wishes to them. We must firmly remember these two sentences spoken by Comrade Mao Zedong at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "Modesty helps one to progress, while arrogance makes one fall behind." We must be good at learning from our advanced Soviet Union, be good at learning from all countries, big and small, and be good at uniting all forces that can be united internationally in order to build our motherland and strive for lasting world peace.

### 努力建设祖国  维护世界和平

    努力建设祖国  维护世界和平
    我国人民今天以欢乐和自豪的心情庆祝中华人民共和国成立的第七周年。
    在今年的国庆节前夜，我国人民已经基本上取得了社会主义革命的胜利。我国的第一个五年计划在过去三年零九个月的时间内已经获得重大的成就，全国人民正在为在明年超额完成第一个五年计划而努力。我们的国家正以一个充满信心和力量的社会主义国家的姿态，出现在亚洲和世界的舞台上。由于我们祖国日益强大，由于我国一贯执行维护世界和平和加强各国人民友好合作的外交政策，我国在国际事务中所起的作用和影响，正在日益增强。在这全国欢腾的伟大节日里，我们每一个人，都有理由为了我们的努力在国内外所取得的成就而欢欣鼓舞。
    刚刚结束的具有历史意义的中国共产党第八次全国代表大会，向全国人民展示了我们祖国的光明灿烂的未来。这次大会总结了过去几年我国社会主义事业的经验，提出了第二个五年计划的基本轮廓，号召全党团结一致，并且团结国内外一切可能团结的力量，为了建设一个伟大的工业化的社会主义的中国而奋斗。
    目前的国际形势对于我国的社会主义建设是有利的。这个形势的特点就是全世界争取和维护和平的力量在不断地发展和壮大，而侵略和战争的势力在不断地削弱和趋向孤立。国际形势继续朝着这个方向发展，无疑将大大地巩固世界和平和国际安全，并且使世界的持久和平成为可能。
    以苏联为首的社会主义国家的存在，它们的力量和威望的迅速增长，是世界和平的有力保障。欧亚两洲的社会主义国家已经拥有九亿多人口，占世界人口三分之一，而且在世界四分之一以上的土地上连成一片，结成了一个可以互相支援的强大的世界体系。由于社会主义制度的优越性，和在这个制度下人民的高涨的劳动热情，所有社会主义国家都在和平建设中取得了卓越的成就，国民经济获得了巨大的发展。在各社会主义国家之间存在着兄弟般的友谊，形成了牢不可破的团结。
    中国人民建设社会主义所获得的成就，是整个社会主义体系的成就的一部分。中国人民力量的成长和壮大，将进一步加强整个社会主义体系的力量和威望，促进世界和平事业的发展。中国人民在建设社会主义的事业中，已经取得并将继续取得伟大的苏联和其他社会主义国家的兄弟般的援助。不断地巩固和发展我国同苏联和各人民民主国家之间的最亲密的友好合作，是我国在国际事务中的首要任务。
    社会主义国家对于反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的各国人民的同情和支持，大大鼓舞了战后全世界民族独立运动的发展和胜利。战后十一年来，已经有占世界人口将近一半的十二亿以上的人民，摆脱了殖民地或半殖民地的地位。现在仍然处在被压迫地位的民族，也正在为争取独立自由而斗争。大多数在战后取得独立的国家，为了巩固自己的独立，发展自己的经济，都反对参加军事集团，主张和平共处。它们反对战争和战争威胁，要求和平。所有这一切，都大大地削弱了帝国主义势力，严重地打击了它们煽动战争、制造紧张局势的阴谋。世界反殖民主义力量的发展，是保障世界和平的一支极其巨大的力量。
    中国人民对于殖民主义的祸害有深刻的体会，对于已经取得独立的国家维护独立的愿望有深刻的了解。因此，中国人民坚决支持世界上任何地方的争取和维护民族独立的斗争。我们要在和平共处的五项原则的基础上，进一步发展同印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、尼泊尔、埃及、叙利亚等亚洲和非洲的爱好和平的国家的友好关系。我们坚决支持埃及和其他阿拉伯国家在苏伊士运河问题上的严正立场，支持印度尼西亚要求收回西伊里安的立场，支持阿尔及利亚人民和其他殖民地人民的要求民族独立的立场。支持反对殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的运动，就是维护世界和平。我们必须在这一方面作充分的努力。
    和平力量和战争势力之间的力量对比发生变化的另一个重要原因，就是保卫和平运动的广泛展开。社会主义国家进行巨大规模的和平建设和执行和平外交政策的事实，使得资本主义世界中越来越多的人识破了美国所散布的反共谎言。他们认识到，在进行扩军备战的十年冷战中，他们所得到的只是贫穷困苦和沉重的军费负担，以及被美国拖进一场新的世界战争的危险。现在，要求裁减军备、禁止原子武器和核子武器、废除禁运、实行和平共处、扩大经济和文化交流的，不仅仅有广大的工人、农民和知识分子，而且也有日益增多的各国资产阶级中的爱国人士。有广泛阶层参加的反对战争政策、保卫和平的运动的发展，对许多国家的外交政策发生了有利的影响。越来越多的国家不愿意继续追随美国而采取了和平中立的政策，使得美国在全世界组织的军事侵略集团出现了分崩离析的迹象。
    我们中国人民将同一切爱好和平的人民在一起，继续为裁减军备、禁止大规模毁灭性武器而努力。我们将积极发展同其他国家在外交上、经济上、文化上的关系，扩大相互之间的友好往来。各国政府领导人员和人民之间的相互接触和访问，必然会增进国际间的信任和了解，消除国际反动势力所散布的猜疑和不信任的空气。这是有助于巩固世界和平的事业的。
    世界和平和进步力量的发展，促进了帝国主义集团内部的矛盾，特别是美国和英国这两个最大的资本主义国家之间的矛盾。在新的国际形势下，主要资本主义国家的外交政策正陷于混乱的境地。在某些资本主义国家的统治集团中，为了摆脱自己的困难处境，并且迫于人民的强大压力，已经开始出现了赞成和平共处的趋向。但是帝国主义的好战集团却还在企图从制造紧张局势和推行战争政策中寻找出路。因此，我们仍然必须保持高度的警惕，严防帝国主义的战争和挑衅阴谋。
    我们的事业是正义的，是符合于世界各国人民的利益的，因此，我们的朋友遍于全世界。今天在我们的首都同我们一道庆祝这个节日的，有我们的友邦印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺、尼泊尔王国首相阿查里雅，有出席中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的各国兄弟党代表团，以及来自许多国家的官方和民间性的代表团和知名人士。他们就是各国人民对我们的友谊和同情的化身。我们热烈地欢迎他们，并且向他们表示深切的感激和最好的祝愿的心情。我们要牢牢记住毛泽东同志在中国共产党第八次全国代表大会上说的这两句话，“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。我们要善于向我们的先进者苏联学习，善于向一切大小国家学习，善于团结国际上一切可能团结的力量，以便建设我们的祖国，并且争取世界的持久和平。
