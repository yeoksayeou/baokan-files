Title: Too Many of Our Cadres Have Been Transferred

To the Editor:

    The leading organs of Wenjiang Special District, Sichuan Province, frequently transfer a large number of cadres from enterprises and companies to do other work. For example, the Wenjiang Textile Branch Company nominally has thirty-eight cadres, but in reality, a large number of them are drawn by the District Committee and the Special Commissioner's Office to do central work. Among them, sixteen people have been drawn out for eight or nine months.

    Due to the large-scale transfer of cadres, the normal work of the company has been seriously affected. Just look, the finance and planning sections, responsible for compiling, sorting, collecting, and statistically reporting for twelve grassroots units, each have only one and a half cadres. The organization and technology section, responsible for leading the transportation and storage of twelve units, has only half a cadre. The transformation section, responsible for the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, has not had a single cadre for half a year. The deputy section chief of that section has worked in the company for about twenty days in the nine months since he took office. The secretary and personnel sections have long had only one mail clerk.

    I think this situation is really unreasonable and should not continue.

### 把我们的干部调得太多了

    把我们的干部调得太多了编辑同志：
    四川省温江专区领导机关，经常抽调大批企业公司的干部去做别的工作，比如温江纺织品分公司，名义上虽有三十八个干部，实际上有很大一部分被地委、专署抽调去做中心工作，其中被抽出已经八、九个月的就有十六人。
    由于干部被大批抽调，就严重地影响了该公司的正常工作。请看吧，负责编制、整理、收集和统计十二个基层单位的财务、计划两科，每科仅有干部一个半人。领导十二个单位运输和保管的组织技术科只有半个干部。负责对资本主义工商业改造的改造科，半年来一个干部也没有。该科的副科长自到职以来的九个月中，在公司工作了二十来天。秘书和人事两科长期以来却只有一个收发员。
    这种情况，我认为实在不合理，不该再继续下去了。　里沙
