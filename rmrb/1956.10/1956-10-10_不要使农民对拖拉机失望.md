　　Don't Let Farmers Down on Tractors
　　Chen Zhao
　　If you ask a staff member of an agricultural machinery station: What is the primary task of an agricultural machinery station? He will definitely answer without hesitation: "To serve agricultural cooperatives and ensure that agricultural cooperatives increase production more." But how good is the service really? Not every station can provide a satisfactory answer with facts.
　　On September 4, the "Shanxi Farmer" newspaper published letters from the directors of the Beihuqiao Agricultural Cooperative and the Xihebao Agricultural Cooperative in Zhangqing Township, Yuci County, criticizing the Yuci Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station for not acting in accordance with the contract. The letter stated: On June 14 this year, the Yuci Tractor Station signed a contract with their cooperative to deep-plow 983 mu of wheat fields for the cooperative. On July 5, the tractor arrived, but it only had a disc harrow and left after harrowing more than 700 mu. What was the quality of the harrowing? The letter wrote: "The wheat stubble still stood after harrowing, only some lines were drawn in the field. Immediately after that, it was continuous rainy weather, and the field turned into a grassland. We waited until after the Beginning of Autumn, but still couldn't wait for the tractor to come and plow, so we had to organize animal power to plow. At this time, the grass in the field was already half a person tall, and the plowing animals couldn't get in, so we had to organize the cooperative members to cut the grass first, which took more than 700 man-days."
　　In fact, such situations of not abiding by contracts and not guaranteeing the quality of work are not uncommon for the Yuci Agricultural Machinery Station. This station should have seriously examined its work long ago. During the spring plowing season this year, a tractor from this station plowed a piece of land with an area of 132 mu for the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Dongyang Township, of which about one-quarter was missed. If we look back at the autumn plowing last year, the quality of work was even worse. For example, there was a section of land that was missed when plowing for Haocun; at the same time, the bottom of the plow was uneven, and some ends of the field were not plowed. Most of the autumn-plowed land that the station was responsible for last year was not harrowed in time after plowing, and the soil clods were very large, which could not retain moisture. Therefore, the farmers sarcastically said: "The tractor doesn't drag the harrow, the plowed clods are as big as a human head!"
　　What is exposed here are just the shortcomings of the Yuci Agricultural Machinery Station in its operations. Similar phenomena of violating machine plowing contracts and poor operation quality occurred in many agricultural machinery stations during the spring plowing season this year. Some staff members of agricultural machinery stations only cared about pursuing workload and reducing fuel consumption, but did not pay attention to the quality of work. Even some leaders of agricultural machinery stations equate ensuring operation quality with completing tasks, believing that they cannot emphasize checking operation quality, otherwise they will not be able to complete the tasks!
　　It can be seen that just saying verbally that you are serving agricultural cooperatives does not mean that you truly understand the important meaning of your work. The most important thing is to see whether you are serving well in actual work. And operation quality is the fundamental indicator to measure whether any agricultural machinery station serves farmers well or badly.
　　For a long time, farmers have yearned for tractors, regarding the use of tractors as a great happiness and as a reliable guarantee for increasing production and increasing income. Therefore, they warmly welcome agricultural machinery stations to use machines to plow their land. It can be imagined that if the operation quality of agricultural machinery stations is not as good as the quality of manual operations using animal power, if the use of machine plowing cannot guarantee increased production, how can farmers not be disappointed? How can agricultural machinery stations win the trust of farmers? Whether considering the economic interests of farmers or the political influence of agricultural machinery stations, we should treat the quality of machine plowing operations with a serious and responsible attitude. Naturally, under the current conditions of low technical level and not much experience in machine plowing operations, it is not an easy task to guarantee operation quality. However, if we can correct our business thinking, correct our service attitude, and seriously summarize and absorb the experience and lessons from past operations, and make great efforts in management system, technology, and political work, then it is entirely possible to gradually improve the quality of machine plowing operations and improve the business level of agricultural machinery stations.
　　Autumn plowing and autumn sowing have already begun. It is hoped that in this year's autumn plowing, we will no longer hear farmers' complaints about agricultural machinery stations, but only hear their praises.

　　不要使农民对拖拉机失望
　　陈昭
    如果问起一个农业机器站的工作人员：农业机器站的首要任务是什么？他一定会毫不含糊地回答：“为农业社服务，保证农业社更多地增产。”但是，究竟服务得怎么样呢？这却不是每一个站都能用事实给予满意的回答的。
    9月4日“山西农民”报上登出了榆次县张庆乡北胡乔农业社和西河堡农业社两位主任的信，他们对榆次农业机器拖拉机站不按合同办事，提出了批评。信里说：今年6月14日，榆次拖拉机站和他们社订了给该社深耕九百八十三亩麦田的合同。7月5日，拖拉机来了，只带了个圆盘耙，耙了七百多亩就回去了。耙地的质量怎样呢？信里写道：“耙过的地里，麦茬还是长着不动，只是在地里划了些道道。紧接着就是阴雨连天，地里变成了草滩。一直等得过了立秋，还是等不上拖拉机来耕地，我们只好组织畜力来耕。这时地里的草已经长有半人高，耕畜进不去，只好先组织社员割草，用了七百多个人工。”
    其实，像这样不遵守合同、作业不保证质量的情况，在榆次农业机器站来说，已经不是什么稀罕事，这个站早就该认真地检查一下自己的工作了。今年春耕期间，这个站的一台拖拉机给东阳乡红光农业社耕了一块面积为一百三十二亩的地，其中漏耕的约占四分之一。如果再回顾去年秋耕的情况，作业质量更不好。例如，那时给郝村耕的地，就有一段漏耕的；同时犁底不平，有的地头没有耕。去年这个站负责耕过的大部分秋耕地，因为耕后没有及时耙，土块很大，不能保墒。所以农民讽刺说：“拖拉机，不拖耙，耕的疙瘩人头大！”
    这里揭发的只是榆次农业机器站作业中的缺点。类似这样违反机耕合同、作业质量低劣的现象，今年春耕期间在不少农业机器站里都发生过。有些农业机器站的工作人员，只顾追求工作量和降低耗油量，而不注意作业质量。甚至有的农业机器站领导人员也把保证作业质量同完成任务对立起来，认为不能强调检查作业质量，否则就完不成任务！
    可见，光是口头上说为农业社服务，并不等于真正认识了自己工作的重要意义。最重要的是看在实际工作中是否服务得好。而作业质量正是衡量任何一个农业机器站为农民服务得好或坏的根本标志。
    多少时候以来，农民就向往着拖拉机，把使用拖拉机看作很大的幸福，看作是增加生产、增加收入的可靠保证。因此，他们才热烈地欢迎农业机器站用机器给他们耕地。可以设想，如果农业机器站的作业质量，比不上使用畜力的手工作业的质量，如果采用了机耕而不能保证增产，农民怎么能不失望？农业机器站又怎么能博得农民的信任呢？不论为农民的经济利益着想，或是为农业机器站的政治影响着想，都应该用严肃负责的态度来对待机耕作业质量。自然，在当前的技术水平不高、机耕作业经验不多的条件下，要保证作业质量，并不是轻而易举的事。但是，如果能够端正经营思想，端正服务态度，认真总结和吸收过去作业中的经验教训，从管理制度上、技术上和政治工作上作巨大的努力，那末，逐步提高机耕作业质量和改善农业机器站的经营水平，是完全可能的。
    秋耕秋种已经开始了。希望在今年的秋耕中不再听到农民对农业机器站的埋怨，而只听到对它的赞美。
