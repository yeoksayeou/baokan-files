Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, October 28th. The State Commercial Bank of Burma recently pointed out in a report that in the fiscal year 1955-56, significant changes occurred in the direction of Burma's export trade.

The report on Burma's economic situation for 1955-56 stated that Burma had concluded trade agreements with the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria. It extended its trade agreements with the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. According to these agreements, the aforementioned countries will export manufactured goods, machinery, electrical, and scientific equipment to Burma, and import rice, timber, and metallic minerals from Burma. The report stated that India is no longer Burma's main customer, and Japan has replaced it, purchasing 11% of Burma's total exports. The next largest were Britain and the People's Republic of China.

The report said that available figures show that the total export value for this period was 1,023.1 million Kyats, while the total import value was 847.6 million Kyats. Therefore, the trade surplus was 175.5 million Kyats, compared to a trade surplus of 192.2 million Kyats in 1954-55.

Due to the reduction in rice export prices, the actual export revenue decreased. The report stated that during this period, the total export volume of rice and rice products was 1.68 million tons, indicating an increase of 110,000 tons compared to the previous year. However, the actual revenue decreased from 835.3 million Kyats to 764.9 million Kyats. Among imported goods, consumer goods accounted for approximately 66% of the total, with textiles alone accounting for 23% of the total imports. The report stated that Britain was the largest exporter to Burma, and its proportion of Burma's total imports increased from 23% to 28% in this fiscal year, followed by India and Japan, each accounting for 17%.

The report stated that the estimated output of paddy rice was 5.8 million tons, an increase of 1.1% compared to the previous year. The output of peanuts and sesame also steadily increased. However, the estimated output of cotton decreased by 24% compared to 1954-55. Estimated figures also showed that major forest products decreased by an average of 42.6% compared to the same period last year.

Crude oil production was nearly 44.7 million gallons, an increase of slightly more than 23.5% compared to the same period last year. Cement production increased by 3.2% compared to the same period last year, but cotton yarn production decreased. The report stated that some new industries have started operation this year.

The report stated that the consumer price index increased from 309 in June of last year to 407 in June of this year, reflecting an increase in the cost of living after price increases. In particular, the clothing index increased from 410 in June of last year to 673 in June of this year.

    缅甸发表1955—56年度经济情况报告
    指出出口贸易方向有重要变化
    新华社仰光28日电　缅甸的国家商业银行最近在一份报告中指出，在1955—56年度，缅甸出口贸易的方向发生了重要的变化。
    这份关于缅甸1955—56年度经济情况的报告说，缅甸同苏联、波兰、罗马尼亚、南斯拉夫和保加利亚缔结了贸易协定。它延长了同人民中国、捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利的贸易协定。根据这些协定，上述国家将输出制成品、机器、电气和科学装备给缅甸，而从缅甸输入大米、木材和金属矿物。报告说，印度已经不再成为缅甸的主要主顾，而由日本取代了它的地位；日本购买了缅甸出口货总值的11％。其次是英国和人民中国。
    报告说，可以得到的数字表明，在这个时期出口总值是十亿二千三百一十万缅元而进口总值是八亿四千七百六十万缅元。因此贸易出超为一亿七千五百五十万缅元，而在1954年—55年度贸易出超为一亿九千二百二十万缅元。
    主要由于大米的出口价格降低，出口实收款项减少了。报告说，在这个时期，大米和大米产品的输出总量为一百六十八万吨，这表明比前一年增加十一万吨。然而实收款项却从八亿三千五百三十万缅元减少到七亿六千四百九十万缅元。在进口货物当中，消费品大约占总额的66％。其中纺织品一项就占进口总额的23％。报告说，对缅甸输出最多的是英国，它在缅甸进口总额中所占的比重在这一年度已经从23％增加到28％，其次是印度和日本，它们各占17％。
    报告说，稻谷的产量估计为五百八十万吨，比上一年增加1.1％。花生和芝麻的产量也获得了稳步的增加。但是棉花的产量估计比1954—55年减少了24％。估计的数字还表明主要的森林产品比去年同时期平均减少了42.6％。
    原油的产量将近四千四百七十万加仑，比去年同期增加了23.5％多一点。水泥的产量比去年同时期增加了3.2％，但是棉纱的产量减少了。报告说，某些新工业已在今年开工。
    报告说，消费品物价指数从去年6月的三零九增加到今年6月的四零七，这反映了物价上涨后生活费用的增加。特别是衣着的指数从去年6月的四一○增加到今年6月的六七三。
