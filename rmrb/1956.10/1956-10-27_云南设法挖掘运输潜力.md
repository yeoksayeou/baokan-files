Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, October 24th. The Yunnan Province Transportation Bureau has taken various measures to tap nearly 500,000 ton-kilometers of transportation capacity from existing transportation vehicles. It is estimated that by the end of October, another 2 million ton-kilometers of transportation potential can be tapped, solving the problem of insufficient transportation capacity to some extent.

    The first method adopted by this transportation bureau is to implement a day and night two-shift work system on the main highways with more drivers and better conditions throughout the province. This method can increase the average daily transportation volume of each vehicle by about 70%. Currently, it is only implemented on more than 20 vehicles in Kunming and Zhanyi. The results show that monthly transportation capacity can be increased by more than 160,000 ton-kilometers. Before the end of the year, the transportation bureau also plans to implement a two-shift system on more than 100 vehicles. It is now using short-term training methods to familiarize drivers who have been out of work for many years with their jobs.

    The transportation bureau has also decided to convert 200 charcoal-powered vehicles into gasoline-powered vehicles before the end of the year. Twenty-seven vehicles have already been converted, and transportation capacity can be increased by more than 58,000 ton-kilometers per month. The remaining 400 unconverted charcoal-powered vehicles distributed throughout the province are also prepared to fully issue auxiliary gasoline for uphill driving, in light of the fact that Yunnan's roads have many steep slopes; this will also improve the transportation efficiency of charcoal vehicles.

    In order to fully exploit the transportation potential of the province, the transportation bureau has also organized automobiles from Yunnan Province, Kunming City, government agencies, factories, mines, and the military to participate in amateur transportation. These amateur transportation vehicles completed more than 160,000 ton-kilometers of transportation tasks in early October. This year, these departments will also undertake more than 760,000 ton-kilometers of tasks for the transportation bureau.

    In addition to this, the Yunnan Province Transportation Bureau has also made some improvements in station operations and yard management, increasing the usage time of each vehicle by two days per month. At the same time, many mass transportation stations have been established in Simao, Gejiu and other places in order to fully utilize folk animal-powered transportation tools.

    云南设法挖掘运输潜力
    新华社昆明24日电　云南省交通厅运输局采取各种措施，从现有交通工具中挖掘出将近五十万吨公里的运输能力。预计到10月底，还可以挖掘出二百万吨公里的运输潜力，解决部分运输能力不足的问题。
    这个运输局采取的第一个办法，是在全省驾驶员较多条件较好的公路干线上，实行日夜两班工作制，这种办法可以使平均每辆车每天增加运量70％左右。现在只在昆明、沾益两地二十多辆汽车中实行结果，每月就可以增加运输能力十六万多吨公里。年底以前，运输局还准备将一百多辆汽车实行两班制。现在正用短期训练的方法，让歇业多年的驾驶员熟悉业务。
    这个运输局还决定在年底以前，把二百部木炭车改装成汽油车。现在已经改装好二十七辆汽车，运输能力每月可以增加五万八千多吨公里。其余分布在各地的四百辆没有改装的木炭车，也准备根据云南公路坡多坡陡的情况，将全部增发上坡时用的辅助汽油，这也能够提高木炭车的运输效率。
    为了充分发挥全省的运输潜力，这个运输局还组织了云南省、昆明市的机关、工矿和军队的汽车参加业余运输。这些业余运输工具在10月上旬就完成了十六万多吨公里的运输任务。今年内，这些部门还将为运输局担负七十六万多吨公里的任务。
    除此以外，云南省运输局在站务作业和场务管理上，也进行了一些改善。使每辆车每个月的使用时间增加了两天。同时还在思茅、个旧等地，成立了许多群众运输站，以便充分利用民间的兽力运输工具。
