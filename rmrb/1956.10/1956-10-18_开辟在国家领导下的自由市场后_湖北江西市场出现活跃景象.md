(Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, October 17th) Since Hubei Province universally opened free markets under state leadership in July, it has changed the previous phenomenon of sluggish urban and rural economies due to overly rigid primary market management.

    In the past, Hubei Province's supply and marketing cooperatives excessively emphasized unified management. Because local supply and marketing cooperatives could not freely purchase and sell goods, they adopted the attitude of "I'll collect whatever the higher authorities want, and I won't collect what you don't want." Therefore, although the province had over a thousand kinds of local specialties, the provincial supply and marketing cooperative only managed eighty-odd kinds of bulk, fast-selling goods. Local supply and marketing cooperatives also only dealt with bulk, fast-selling local products, and were unwilling to handle various small local products and some seasonal local products. In addition, the market management between urban and rural areas and between certain regions was too rigid, and farmers and small vendors could not conduct normal transactions in the market, so the market was very inactive. Now, due to regional opening and the implementation of free selection and free transportation, the enthusiasm of local supply and marketing cooperatives, farmers, small vendors, handicraftsmen, etc., has been enhanced, and the market has presented a new atmosphere. Since July, the amount of local products purchased by supply and marketing cooperatives in Hubei Province has been increasing month by month. The purchase amount in July reached more than 6.37 million yuan, an increase of 28.93% compared with June, and an increase of 53.58% compared with the same period last year. The purchase amount in August reached more than 8.8 million yuan, an increase of 30.52% compared with July, and an increase of 149.23% compared with the same period last year. The varieties operated by various supply and marketing cooperatives have also increased by dozens to more than 350 kinds.
    Some slow-selling local products have also gradually opened up sales channels. For example, the red earth (dye) in Yidu County was actively promoted to Sichuan by the county cooperative through contacting small vendors, selling 240,000 jin. The county cooperative is also actively promoting the slow-selling Vitex negundo, horse whips, and dry bamboo in Xianning and other places to the Northeast, East China, Wuhan, and other places in large quantities. In the past, the hoe handles and palm bed frames produced by farmers in Xianning County had to be stopped because the local supply and marketing cooperatives and timber companies did not purchase them, and they could not sell them in other places. Now, they transport hoe handles and palm bed frames to Wuhan for sale, and the price and sales are very good. In August, more than 30 county cooperatives across the province took the initiative to promote local products to other places, which played a significant role in developing rural sideline occupations and increasing farmers' income.
    The implementation of free selection and free transportation has also reduced the number of commodity circulation links and reduced costs. For example, the Wuhan Bamboo Ware Production Cooperative can now directly purchase Phyllostachys edulis from Xianning County, and the purchase price is 20% cheaper than the original price purchased from the provincial supply and marketing cooperative. The Oumiao District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xiangyang County originally purchased saltpeter on behalf of the county cooperative, with a purchase price of 0.297 yuan per jin and a sales price of 0.37 yuan. Now, after changing to self-operation, the purchase price has been raised to 0.31 yuan, and the sales price has been reduced to 0.358 yuan, which benefits both producers and consumers.
    Various places have also reasonably adjusted the purchase prices of local products, correcting the phenomenon of low purchase prices for small local products. The Yidu County Cooperative comprehensively reviewed the purchase prices of 245 kinds of local products, of which 131 were raised, 48 remained unchanged, and 66 were lowered.

(Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, October 15th, reporter Wang Jiefang reports:) Since Jiangxi Province opened free markets under state leadership, the market has shown a lively scene.

    In Ganzhou, in the past, the supply and marketing cooperative exclusively purchased firewood and charcoal, and farmers could not directly carry firewood and charcoal into the city for sale, resulting in a tense supply of firewood and charcoal at times. Now, with the implementation of free purchase and sale, farmers in the suburbs and nearby mountainous areas are continuously carrying firewood and charcoal into the city for supply. After the opening of the Datangxu (market town) free market in Xinfeng County, the amount of live chickens and fresh eggs on the market day has increased by more than double compared to the past. In the past, there was very little pig feed on the market in this market town. Now, more than 100 dan of fine bran, Polygonum vine, and other feeds are on the market every market day, and many pig farmers can buy feed in the market. In the Shangshi District market in Yudu County, small piglets, brown sugar, sweet potato flour, etc., which farmers needed in the past, were often in short supply. Now, after organizing small vendors to freely transport them, supply can be met. In the border areas, the original commercial relations have also been restored. For example, many small vendors in Ruijin County, which is adjacent to Fujian, have recently gone to Changting County in Fujian Province to purchase homespun cloth, native paper, and other goods that meet the needs of local farmers.
    In the early stage of opening free markets in various places, prices rose somewhat. However, as the amount of many items on the market increased, prices have gradually fallen and are trending towards stability.

### 开辟在国家领导下的自由市场后  湖北江西市场出现活跃景象

    开辟在国家领导下的自由市场后
    湖北江西市场出现活跃景象
    本报汉口17日电　湖北省自7月份在全省范围内普遍开辟了在国家领导下的自由市场以来，已经改变了过去由于初级市场管理过死，以致城乡经济不活跃的现象。
    过去，湖北省供销合作社过分强调统一经营，各基层供销社因为不能自由购销，便抱着“上级要啥我收啥，你不要我不收”的态度。因此，全省虽有千余种土特产，而省供销社只经营了大宗的畅销商品八十余种，各地供销社也只经营大宗的畅销的土产，对多种小土产和部分有季节性的土产，都不愿意经营。再加上城乡之间和某些地区之间的市场管理过死，农民和小商小贩不能在市场上进行正常交易，所以市场很不活跃。现在，由于地区开放，实行了自由选购和自由贩运，提高了各基层供销社、农民、小商小贩、手工业者等的经营积极性，市场呈现了一片新的气象。从7月以来，湖北省各地供销合作社收购土产的数额逐月上升。7月份收购额达六百三十七万多元，比6月份上升了28.93％，比去年同期上升了53.58％。8月份收购额达到八百八十多万元，比7月份上升了30.52％，比去年同期上升了149.23％。各供销社经营的品种，也增加了数十种到三百五十多种。
    某些滞销的土产也逐渐打开了销路。如宜都县的红土（染料），经县社主动联系小商小贩向四川推销了二十四万斤。咸宁等地滞销的黄荆条、马鞭、枯竹等，县社也正向东北、华东、武汉等地大量推销。过去咸宁县农民生产的锄头柄、棕床框架，因为当地的供销社和木材公司都不收购，自己又不能到外地卖，不得不停止生产。现在，他们把锄头柄和棕床框架运到武汉市来卖，价钱、销路都很好。全省8月份内有三十多个县社主动向外推销了土产，这对发展农村副业，增加农民收入起了很大作用。
    由于实行自由选购和自由贩运，还减少了商品流转环节，降低了费用。例如武汉篾器生产合作社现在可以直接到咸宁县采购楠竹，采购的价钱比原来在省供销社购进的价钱便宜20％。襄阳县欧庙区供销社原来是替县社代购土硝，购价每斤0.297元，销价0.37元，现在改为自营后，购价提为0.31元，销价降为0.358元，使生产者和消费者都有利。
    各地还合理调整了土产收购价格，纠正了小土产收价偏低的现象。宜都县社将二百四十五种土产收购价格全面进行了审查，计调高的一百三十一种，不动的四十八种，调低的六十六种。
    新华社南昌15日电　新华社记者王介方报道：江西省自从开辟国家领导下的自由市场以后，市场上出现了活跃景象。
    赣州市过去由于供销合作社独家收购木柴、木炭，农民不能直接挑柴挑炭进城出售，致使柴炭供应有时发生紧张状态；现在实行自由购销，市郊和附近山区的农民就源源地将木柴、木炭挑进城来供应。信丰县大塘圩（集镇）开辟自由市场后，每逢集日，毛鸡、鲜蛋的上市量比过去增加一倍以上。过去这个集镇很少有喂猪饲料上市，现在每集上市的细糠、藜藤等饲料有一百多担，许多喂猪的农民可以在市场上买到饲料了。雩都县上石区市场，过去农民需要的小猪、土糖、薯粉等常常缺货，现在组织小商贩自由贩运后，可以满足供应了。在边境地区，现在也恢复了原来的商业关系。如邻近福建的瑞金县许多小商贩，最近已到福建省长汀县采购适合当地农民需要的土蓝布、土纸等货物。
    各地开辟自由市场初期，价格有些上涨。但是随着许多物品上市量的增多，价格已逐步降落，趋向稳定。
