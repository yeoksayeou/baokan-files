Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, October 10th (Reporter Song He): More than half of Sichuan Province's 56 million mu of paddy fields are now guaranteed irrigation.

    The relevant department head of the Sichuan Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau recently inspected the province's farmland water conservancy construction from October of last year to September of this water conservancy planning year. He told reporters that during this year, the province newly built more than 1,020 medium and small reservoirs (each of which can irrigate an average of 1,500 mu), tens of thousands of mountain ponds and dikes, and expanded irrigation projects on existing water conservancy facilities such as Dujiangyan, Guanquyan, and Tongjiyan, guaranteeing irrigation for approximately 9 million mu of paddy fields in the province. Adding this number to the more than 11,620,000 mu of paddy fields in the province that were guaranteed irrigation from water conservancy construction from 1950 to September 1955, and adding the more than 10,590,000 mu of paddy fields that were originally guaranteed irrigation before liberation, now more than 55% of the province's paddy fields are guaranteed irrigation.

    The head stated that the above situation shows that the scale, speed, and achievements of water conservancy construction in the province from last winter to the present have surpassed any previous year, and this situation is inseparable from the province's realization of semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization. After cooperativization, the difficulties encountered by farmers in water conservancy construction in terms of labor, land occupation, capital, and technology have been greatly reduced, and many water conservancy projects that were previously considered impossible to build can now be constructed. For example, farmers from four advanced agricultural cooperatives in Dongba Township, Guangyuan County, built a 25-li-long river-blocking dam with more than 40 culverts and bridges in the spring of this year, capable of irrigating more than 4,000 mu of paddy fields, a project that local farmers had aspired to for decades. When Mingyue Township, Kaijiang County, recently built the Mingyue Reservoir, an average of 2,500 people participated every day, a situation rarely seen before cooperativization.

    The vast majority of Sichuan Province's more than 56 million mu of paddy fields are distributed in hilly areas. These paddy fields need guaranteed irrigation to increase production annually. The fact that more than 55% of the province's paddy fields are now guaranteed irrigation plays a significant role in the province's future increase and stabilization of rice production.

    四川省半数以上水田获得灌溉保证
    新华社成都10日电　新华社记者宋禾报道：拥有五千六百多万亩水田的四川省，目前已有一半以上的水田得到了灌溉保证。
    四川省水利厅有关部门负责人，最近检查了从去年10月到今年9月这一水利计划年度中全省兴修农田水利的情况。他告诉记者说：在这一年中，全省新修了一千零二十多座中、小型水库（这种水库平均每个可灌田一千五百亩），数万口山弯塘和壋堰，并且在都江堰、官渠堰、通济堰等原有的水利设施上进行了扩灌工程，使全省约九百万亩水田得到了灌溉保证。这个数字，加上从1950年到1955年9月，全省因兴修水利获得灌溉保证的一千一百六十二万多亩水田，又加上解放前原有灌溉保证的一千零五十九万多亩水田，现在全省就有55％以上的水田获得了灌溉保证。
    这位负责人说：上述情况说明，从去年冬天到现在，全省兴修水利的规模、速度和成果都超过了以往的任何一年，而这个情况是和全省实现了半社会主义的农业合作化分不开的。合作化后，农民在兴修水利上碰到的劳动力、占地、资金和技术等方面的困难，已经大大减少，许多过去认为无法兴修的水利工程，现在也修起来了。例如广元县东坝乡四个高级农业社的农民，在今年春天就修成了一条长二十五里、有涵洞桥梁四十多座、能灌溉四千多亩水田的拦河堰，而这条拦河堰是当地农民向往了数十年的。开江县明月乡不久前兴修明月水库时，平均每天有二千五百人参加，这种情况是合作化以前很少看到的。
    四川省的五千六百多万亩水田，绝大部分分布在丘陵地区。这些水田需要有灌溉保证才能常年增产。目前全省有55％以上的水田获得灌溉保证，对全省今后水稻的增产和稳定产量有很大作用。
