　　The Length and Form of Film
　　Haimo
　　I don't know when it was stipulated: the international standard for film length is eight thousand to nine thousand feet. I also don't know when the habit began to circulate: a feature-length novel is generally only allowed to be adapted into one full-length feature film. As a result, the content of the film is stuck at a length of eight thousand feet; as a result, the film and the feature-length novel have formed an unhappy relationship.

　　If this is the international standard, then the Indian film "The Vagabond" that I watched did not comply with this standard. And precisely because it expressed life vividly and thoroughly with sufficient length, and portrayed the characters, it gave us a very satisfied feeling after watching it. Similarly, French films like "The Red and the Black," Japanese films like "A Miner's Woman," and other countries like Italy and the United States all have very long films. The Soviet Union also has many long films such as "Peter the Great," "The Maxim Trilogy," "The Great Citizen," and so on. It seems that today only the Chinese film industry is playing the role of "consistently adhering to international standards."

　　Many sad examples have been caused by rigidly adhering to international standards: some films have to delete one-third or more of the original work in order to squeeze into eight thousand feet; some films do not hesitate to simplify the performance to almost nothing in order not to exceed the prescribed length. On the contrary, some films that are only suitable for short films, such as "Marriage" and "A Proposal," have to be stretched to meet the prescribed length, becoming lengthy films with empty content. What is the purpose of the film? Isn't it to truthfully reflect life, and to educate the audience from the reproduced life through the performance of actors? Now it seems that the purpose of the film is only for eight thousand feet or one hour and forty minutes!

　　Naturally, there are many reasons for insisting on adhering to international standards. The primary argument is: this length and time are most suitable for the audience's eyesight. In fact, what difficulties are there in solving this problem? There is already a precedent for dividing a long film into several parts for screening. Another argument is the issue of international ticket sales habits. This is strange. "The Vagabond" was still sold tickets in various countries around the world. Is it impossible to sell tickets if China exceeds this standard? Another argument is that urban people are too busy to spend more time watching movies. This is even stranger. Audiences in various countries can spend three or four hours watching dramas or operas, and of course they can spend the same amount of time watching movies, as long as they are good movies. Speaking of the viewing habits of Chinese audiences, we know that Chinese audiences are not unwilling to watch serial films. I remember that the early Chinese film "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" was continuously screened for many episodes. Without discussing its content, from the point of view of multi-episode films alone, it is completely acceptable to the audience.

　　Some film masters are good at expressing broad content in concise film forms. For example, the Soviet Donskoy's adaptation of Gorky's "Mother," which I recently saw, is one example. From this film, we can see the director's ingenuity in compressing the content of the original work everywhere. We don't have to oppose artists who like this style. But I never believe that making similar films into two or three parts, and showing the life scenes and character activities described in the literary works more to the audience, would be an inferior work of art.

　　Literature and art have always been good at typically, vividly, and in various forms to express life. If literature and art go on such a path: no matter how much content there is, it can only be expressed in the same length and the same form, it is actually equivalent to destroying literature and art.

　　Everything lies in the content, and the content determines the form.

　　According to the content, movies can be feature films, medium-length films, or short films. There can also be multi-episode serial films.

　　According to the content, movies can also have close-up films, film sketches, essays, or criticism and satire films.

　　Why not try to make a solo into a short music film?

　　Why not try to match good scenery and pictures with beautiful poems to become poetry and painting films?

　　Those various restrictions that do not necessarily have to be absolutely adhered to should be abolished. Our only standard should be: truthfully reflect life, and be loved by the people.

　　电影的长度和形式
    海默
    不知是从什么时候规定下来的：电影长度的国际标准是八千尺到九千尺。也不知道是从什么时候流传下来的习惯：一部长篇小说一般只允许改编成一部长故事片。于是，电影的内容就被八千尺的长度卡住了；于是，电影和长篇小说就结下了不愉快的关系。
    如果说这是国际标准，那么，我看过的印度影片“流浪者”就没有遵守这个标准。而且正因为它以足够的长度淋漓尽致地表现了生活，刻划了人物，使我们看后有着非常满足的感觉。同样，法国影片“红与黑”，日本影片“一个女矿工”，以及其它国家如意大利、美国等都有很长的影片。苏联也有不少长的影片如“彼得大帝”、“马克辛三部曲”、“伟大的公民”等等。看来，今天只有中国的电影界在扮演着“一贯遵守国际标准”的角色。
    死板地遵守国际标准造成的伤心事例已经不少了：有些影片为了挤成八千尺，不得不删掉原作的三分之一或者更多一些；有些影片为了不超过规定长度，不惜将表演简单化到几乎没有的程度。相反，只适合于拍成短篇的如“结婚”、“一件提案”等，却又硬要把它拉成合乎规定长度，成为内容空泛的长片。究竟电影的目的是什么呢？难道不是真实地反映生活，不是通过演员的表演使观众从再现的生活中受到教育吗？现在看来电影的目的好像仅仅是为了八千尺或者一点四十分钟！
    自然，坚持遵守国际标准是有很多理由的。首要一个说法是：在这样的长度和时间内，最适宜于观众的视力。其实要解决这个问题有什么困难呢？一部长片分成几部放映是大有先例在了。再一种说法是国际售票的习惯问题。这就怪了，“流浪者”在世界各国上映都照样卖了票，难道中国超过了这个标准就无法售票？还有一种说法是都市人太忙，不可能花更多的时间去看电影。这更怪了，各国观众可以花三、四个小时去看话剧或歌剧，当然也可以花同样多的时间去看电影，只要是好电影。说到中国观众的习惯，我们知道中国观众并不是不愿意看连集影片的。记得中国早年的电影“火烧红莲寺”一直连续映过很多集，这儿不谈它的内容，单从多集影片这点上来看，它是完全能为观众所接受的。
    有些电影大师是善于将博大的内容用简练的电影形式表现出来的。如最近见到的苏联顿斯科依所改编的高尔基的“母亲”就是一例。从这部影片中，处处可以看到导演将原著内容压缩的匠心。我们不必反对爱好这种风格的艺术家。可是我也决不相信将类似的影片拍成两部或三部，将文学作品所描写的生活场景，人物活动更多地表现在观众面前，就会是艺术上低下的作品。
    文学艺术从来是善于典型地、形象地、以各种不同的形式来表现生活的。如果文学艺术走了这样一条路：不论内容多少，都只能以同样的长度和同样的形式来表现，那实际上就等于毁灭了文学艺术。
    一切在于内容，内容决定形式。
    根据内容，电影可以有长片、中片、短片。也可以有多集连本影片。
    根据内容，电影未尝不可以有特写影片、电影小品，杂感片、或者批评、讽刺影片。
    为什么不可以尝试将独唱拍成短小的音乐片？
    为什么不可以尝试将好的风景和图画配上优美的诗成为诗画片？
    应该废除那些不一定非绝对遵守的种种限制了。我们唯一的标准应该是：真实地反映生活，为人民所喜闻乐见。
