    Spring Barley or Winter Barley

    This spring, the former Dezhou Special District Agricultural Section instructed De County via telephone to increase the planting of spring barley and quickly distributed the seeds. At that time, our district was holding a meeting of agricultural cooperative leaders, and the district committee, based on the spirit of the special district's instructions, explained the significance of planting spring barley at the meeting. The cooperative leaders enthusiastically reported the number of seeds needed on the spot, totaling more than 40,000 jin. The entire district bought more than 56,000 jin in two or three days. Subsequently, the agricultural cooperatives busily engaged in sowing, with some pushing waterwheels and others pulling seed drills, rushing to plant spring barley. Within three or four days, more than 4,700 mu were planted throughout the district. Soon, the barley seedlings grew green and lush, and everyone who saw them said, "This barley will surely have a bumper harvest; let's apply a lot of topdressing fertilizer!"

    Just as the barley seedlings were growing vigorously, a shocking piece of news suddenly spread: "The barley seeds were planted incorrectly. This is not spring barley but winter barley. Planting it this year will only result in weeds and the ears will not bear grain if it survives the winter. Hurry! Stop planting immediately if you haven't planted yet, and pull out what has already been planted..." This news, for those who were pulling seed drills, pushing waterwheels, rushing to plant barley and hoping for a bumper harvest, was like pouring a bucket of cold water on them. Some cooperative cadres went to bed with their heads covered, unable to eat, feeling unable to explain to the members. Looking at the foot-high green seedlings, they were truly reluctant to pull them out, but due to the repeated instructions and urging of the cadres, some cooperatives were forced to reluctantly pull out the barley. A farmer named Li Guizhi said while pulling, "Barley! Barley! Are you winter barley or spring barley? It's not easy for me to cultivate you!" Some of the masses really cherished these barley plants, and they preferred to be criticized rather than let them go. Therefore, many agricultural cooperatives did not pull out their barley seedlings.

    Unexpectedly, those who left them were right. These barley plants, which were thought to have no harvest, actually had a decent yield. The least productive yielded 100 jin per mu, and the best yielded 300-400 jin.

    Why was this loss caused? Where did this trend come from? The investigation revealed the following: This April, Comrade Wang Yuzhen, the seed manager of the De County Agricultural Section, went to a meeting at the Provincial Department of Agriculture. After the meeting, he heard Director Shen say, "The barley seeds we got are no good. The original plan was for spring barley, but it turns out to be winter barley. It won't work here. After discovering this, we have already sent a portion down and issued instructions to each special district and county to stop planting immediately if it hasn't been planted." According to Director Shen's statement, these barley seeds were wrong, but even if they were winter barley, would planting them here work? Would planting them be better than not planting them? Comrade Wang Yuzhen, who managed the seeds, did not understand this clearly. He only knew that the county had already distributed the seeds. After the meeting, he rushed back to De County from Jinan. Coincidentally, the Agricultural Section was holding a meeting of agricultural technical station chiefs from each district. He raised this issue at the meeting, and the chiefs questioned, "Who called for planting this? Can we call for planting if it's no good..." Some said, "Why didn't we check? We were a bit blindly obedient in our execution..."

    While everyone was hesitating, the Liaocheng Special District Grain Bureau instructed the De County Grain Bureau to compensate the masses for the cost of the barley seeds that had already been distributed. The instructions regarding compensation were clear, but they did not clarify whether the barley seeds that had been distributed were wrong or why the compensation was being made.

    The compensation was timely, but it was another blind action. Until the time of compensation, they did not know how many seeds had not been used by the agricultural cooperatives, and how much should be compensated. For example, the Hongxing Cooperative in Caocun Township bought 4,889 jin, and actually used 3,800 jin. There was still a portion unused, but the grain station comrades still compensated according to the original amount. Fortunately, the comrades stationed in the cooperative discovered and corrected it. With this compensation, some farmers said, "The barley is really no good. The higher authorities have compensated for it, so what hope is there?" As a result, the phenomenon of pulling out barley occurred below. The entire district pulled out more than 3,800 mu in three or four days, leaving only a few hundred mu unpulled. If a little more work was put in, each mu would have yielded at least 200 jin. According to this calculation, the entire district destroyed more than 760,000 jin of barley. This is such a heartbreaking loss.

    Seeing the harvest of the barley, the broad masses of farmers were both angry and hateful. Many cooperative cadres found government cadres and tearfully complained, demanding that the government investigate responsibility and seriously handle the matter. Ge Qingquan, the director of the Hongxing Cooperative in Caocun, said, "Isn't this just ruining people? That's destroying barley. Our cooperative planted four or five hundred mu, and one instruction instructed us to destroy it all."

### 春大麦还是冬大麦

    春大麦还是冬大麦
    今年春天，原德州专署农业科在电话上指示德县增种一部分春大麦。并且很快发下了麦种。当时我区正召开各农业社长会议，区委就在会议上根据专署的指示精神说明了种春大麦的意义，各农业社长当场就热烈地报了需要种子的数目，一共四万多斤。全区在二、三天内就买了五万六千多斤。接着各农业社就忙碌地进行播种，有的人推水车，有的人拉耧，抢种春大麦。三、四天内，全区就种上了四千七百多亩。很快，麦苗绿油油地生长出来了，谁看见都这样说：“这麦定能丰收，大量追肥吧！”
    正当麦苗生长旺盛的时候，忽然传出一个震动人心的消息：“这大麦种错啦，这不是春大麦而是冬大麦，当年种上不过冬就是莠出穗来也不结粒，赶快！没种上的马上停种，已种上赶快拔掉……”这个消息对于那些拉耧，推水车抢种大麦盼望着丰收的人们，似乎泼下一瓢凉水，有的社干部蒙头大睡，吃不下饭去，觉得没法向社员交代，看着一尺多高绿油油的小青苗，真舍不得拔掉，但由于干部再三指示督促，有些社被迫忍痛将大麦拔掉。有个农民李桂芝一边拔一边说：“大麦！大麦！你究竟是冬大麦还是春大麦？我培植你可真不易呀！”有部分群众对这些大麦实在留恋，他们宁肯挨批评也要留着点看看，因此有不少农业社的麦苗没有拔掉。
    出人意外，留下的闹对了，这些认为不能有收成的大麦居然有了不坏的收成，最少的一亩地也收一百斤，好的收到三、四百斤。
    为什么造成这种损失呢？这股风是从那里传出的呢？追查结果大体是这样：今年四月间，德县农业科管理种子的王玉珍同志前去省农业厅开会，会后他听到沈厅长说：“咱们弄的大麦种不行了，原计划是春大麦，谁知是冬大麦，到咱这里不行，发觉后已经下去了一部分，给各专署和各县去了个指示，如果没种上要立即停种。”按沈厅长的谈话，这大麦种是错了，可是即便是冬大麦，在这里种到底行不行？种比不种强不强？管理种子的王玉珍同志也没有了解清楚，他只知道本县已经将种子发下去了。散会后他就慌慌张张从济南回到德县来，恰巧农业科正在开各区农业技术站长会议，他就在会议上把这问题提出来，站长们就追问：“这是那里叫种的呀，不行就叫种吗……”有的说：“怎么咱没检查一下？咱执行也有些盲从吧……”
    正在大家犹豫不决之时，聊城专署粮食局指示德县粮食局赔偿已发给群众的大麦种子款。指示对赔款说的倒算清楚，但对已发下去的大麦种到底是错不错，为什么要赔款等却没说清。
    赔款倒是很及时，可惜又是一个盲目行动。直到赔款时尚不知道各农业社还有多少种子未用上，该赔多少？如曹村乡红星社买了四千八百八十九斤，本来实用了三千八百斤，还有一部分未用，可是粮站同志仍按原数赔款，幸亏驻社同志发觉纠正。这样一赔款，有些农民说：“大麦真是不行了，上级都赔了款啦，还有什么希望？”就这样下边拔麦子的现象就发生了。全区在三、四天内拔了三千八百多亩，只留下几百亩未拔。如果加点工每亩最少也平收二百斤的产量，这样算全区就损毁了七十六万多斤大麦。这是一件多么令人心痛的损失呀。
    看到大麦的收成，广大农民又气又恨，不少社干部找到政府干部痛心流泪地诉苦，要政府追查责任，严肃处理。曹村红星社社长戈清泉说：“这不是净毁人吗？那是毁大麦呀，俺社种了四、五百亩，一个指示就给俺指示光啦。”
