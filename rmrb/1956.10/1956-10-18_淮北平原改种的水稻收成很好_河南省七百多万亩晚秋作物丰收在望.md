Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 16th. The replanted rice in the Huaibei Plain is yielding a good harvest. Farmers have already begun harvesting in the past few days. In the Huaibei eight counties of the Bengbu Special Zone, the 886,000+ mu of replanted rice have an average yield of around 250 jin per mu. In the Fuyang Special Zone, the 900,000 mu of medium-season rice are estimated to have an average yield of around 200 jin per mu. Lingbi County replanted rice on more than 61,000 mu of low-lying land, generally yielding around 200 jin per mu. If these 61,000+ mu of low-lying land had been planted with dry-land crops, there would have been no harvest this year, due to the five plantings and five floods.

This year, the replanted rice in the Huaibei area has also produced many high-yield records. The Wangzhuang Production Team of the Chongqi Agricultural Cooperative in Yingshang County replanted 31 mu of rice, averaging 722 jin per mu. The Huanghe Agricultural Cooperative in Dangshan County reclaimed 213 mu of rice paddies on the old course of the Yellow River. The best 3.3 mu yielded 916 jin per mu, while the rest yielded between 200 jin and 600 jin per mu. The Fuguan No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative in Fuyang County had 1.1 mu of japonica rice, with a unit area yield reaching 1,200 jin.

It has been three years since rice was replanted in the Huaibei area, and the replanted area this year is much larger than in previous years. Such large-scale replanting is only possible after agricultural collectivization. This year, agricultural cooperatives in various parts of the Huaibei area have successively built more than 30,000 water conservancy projects. In order to support farmers in the Huaibei area in planting rice, the state invested a total of 500,000 yuan, allocated 16 million jin of high-quality rice seeds and more than 20,000 sets of paddy field farm implements, trained more than 5,000 rice-planting technical cadres for agricultural cooperatives, and transferred a large number of district and township cadres and farmers with rich rice-planting experience from the rice-producing areas on both sides of the Yangtze River to Huaibei to teach techniques.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 16th. The 7,530,000+ mu of late-maturing crops replanted in Henan Province are growing very well. The 3,260,000 mu of buckwheat, which were planted or replanted in a timely manner, are now generally flowering and bearing seeds, and it is estimated that each mu will yield an average of 60 jin; the 180,000 mu of cold millet is expected to yield 100 jin per mu; the 430,000 mu of sweet potatoes are expected to yield 800 jin to 1,000 jin per mu; and the 3,290,000 mu of various vegetables are now generally weighing 4 to 5 jin per head for cabbage, and 0.5 jin each for radishes and turnips. It is estimated that each mu will yield 2,000 jin to 3,000 jin of vegetables, and some good plots can yield 6,000 to 7,000 jin per mu.

Although Henan Province suffered more severe flooding this year than in 1954, the area of rush planting and replanting still reached the same level as in 1954, because the entire province had achieved agricultural collectivization and the cooperatives stubbornly fought against the disaster. Because the cooperatives have strengthened field management of the crops planted and replanted in a timely manner, the expected actual income will greatly exceed the level of 1954.

### 淮北平原改种的水稻收成很好  河南省七百多万亩晚秋作物丰收在望

    淮北平原改种的水稻收成很好
    河南省七百多万亩晚秋作物丰收在望
    新华社合肥16日电　淮北平原上改种的水稻收成很好。这几天农民已开镰收割。蚌埠专区淮北八县改种的八十八万六千多亩水稻，平均每亩产量达二百五十斤左右。阜阳专区的九十万亩中熟稻，据估计每亩平均产量也在二百斤上下。灵璧县在六万一千多亩洼地改种了水稻，一般的每亩都收二百斤左右。这六万一千多亩洼地如果仍种旱粮作物，在今年五种五淹的情况下是不会有收成的。
    今年淮北地区改种的水稻还出现了许多高额丰产的纪录。颍上县重旗农业社王庄生产队改种的三十一亩水稻，平均每亩产七百二十二斤。砀山县黄河农业社在黄河故道的河滩上开垦出来二百一十三亩水稻田，最好的三亩三分每亩收到九百一十六斤，其余的每亩也都收了二百斤到六百斤。阜阳县阜光第一农业社有一亩一分粳稻，单位面积产量达到一千二百斤。
    在淮北地区改种水稻已有三年历史，今年改种面积比往年都大得多。这样大量改种只有农业合作化以后才有可能。今年淮北地区各地农业社先后兴修了三万多处水利工程。国家为了支援淮北地区农民种稻，共投资五十万元，调拨了一千六百万斤优良稻种和两万多部水田农具，为农业社训练了五千多名种稻的技术干部，并从长江两岸水稻产区抽调了大批富有水稻种植经验的区乡干部和农民到淮北传授技术。
    新华社郑州16日电　河南省补种的七百五十三万多亩晚熟作物，生长很好。抢种和补种的三百二十六万亩荞麦，现在都已普遍开花结籽，预计每亩平均可收六十斤；十八万亩寒粟预计每亩可收一百斤；四十三万亩红薯每亩可收八百斤到一千斤；三百二十九万亩各种菜类，现在白菜一般每棵已有四、五斤重，萝卜、蔓菁每个重半斤左右，预计每亩可收菜两千斤到三千斤，个别好的每亩可以收到六、七千斤。
    今年河南省所受水灾虽然比1954年严重，但是因为全省实现了农业合作化，各社顽强地和灾害进行了斗争，抢种和补种的面积仍然还达到了与1954年相等。由于各社加强了对于抢种和补种上的作物的田间管理，预计实际收益将大大超过1954年的水平。
