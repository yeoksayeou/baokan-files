    International Snippets

    Protest by Housewives
    The Hanover Housewives Association of West Germany recently held a physical exhibit to protest the continuous rise in prices in West Germany in recent years. Charts at the exhibition showed that the prices of major necessities in West Germany have generally risen since 1950. Most notably, a table displayed forty-one briquettes, representing the price of coal in 1950. By 1956, the same amount of money could only buy eighteen briquettes.

        Hoodlum Arsenal
    In the United States, the activities of hoodlums are becoming increasingly rampant. According to a recent report, police in Maryland, USA, broke up a hoodlum gang with thirty members. This gang even possessed an arsenal containing seventy-one pistols, three rifles, two shotguns, one rocket launcher, two machine guns, and four bayonets. Intriguingly, they purchased these weapons from the government.

        Many Car Accidents in Japan
    According to a recent white paper on transportation published by the Japanese Police Agency, 91,000 car accidents occurred in Japan last year, an eleven-fold increase compared to 1945. Last year, 82,900 people died in car accidents in Japan, with an average of one out of every five vehicles being involved in an accident. In the first six months of this year alone, Japan had 54,500 car accidents, setting a post-war record for car accidents in Japan.

    国际点滴
    家庭妇女的抗议
    西德汉诺威家庭妇女协会，为了抗议西德近年来物价的不断上涨，最近举行了一次实物展览会。展览会上的图表表明，西德从1950年以来主要的生活用品都普遍涨了价。其中最引人注意的是一张桌子上摆了四十一个煤饼，这表示了1950年煤价的情况，而到1956年以同样的金额只能买到十八个煤饼了。
        阿飞兵工厂
    在美国，阿飞的活动越来越猖狂了。据不久以前的报道，美国马里兰州的警察破获了一个阿飞党，它的成员共有三十人。这个阿飞党甚至还拥有一个兵工厂，其中有手枪七十一支，步枪三支、猎枪二支、火箭炮一架、机关枪两挺和刺刀四把。耐人寻味的是：这些武器是他们从政府那里购买来的。
        日本车祸多
    据日本警察厅最近发表的交通白皮书说：日本去年一年中发生了九万一千件车祸，这个数字已比1945年增加了十一倍。去年，日本死于车祸的有八万二千九百人，平均每五辆中就有一辆发生车祸，今年的头六个月里，日本就已发生了五万四千五百件车祸，创日本战后车祸最高纪录。
