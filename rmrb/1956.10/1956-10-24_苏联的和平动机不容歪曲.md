    Soviet Peaceful Motives Must Not Be Distorted
    On October 17, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, N.A. Bulganin, wrote a letter to U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, reiterating the Soviet Union's hope to immediately conclude an agreement with the United States and other countries possessing atomic weapons to cease testing atomic weapons. This is yet another effort by the Soviet Union to eliminate the threat of atomic war, fully in line with the universal demands of people around the world. However, Eisenhower's unprecedentedly swift reply not only failed to seriously consider the Soviet Union's reasonable proposal, but also rashly distorted the Soviet Union's extremely obvious peaceful motives, claiming that the Soviet proposal "constitutes interference by a foreign power in my country's internal affairs." This is quite astonishing.
    The U.S. government's distortion of the Soviet Union's motives is groundless. The Soviet Union has consistently advocated banning atomic and hydrogen weapons and ceasing the testing of these weapons. In July of this year, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, in addition to supporting the Japanese Diet's resolution on banning atomic weapons testing, approved Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov's proposal for the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom to conclude an agreement to cease atomic weapons testing. At the same time, the Soviet Union, India, and Yugoslavia have made joint efforts at the United Nations Disarmament Conference to strive for a cessation of atomic weapons testing. Bulganin's letter to Eisenhower this time was merely reiterating the proposal to cease atomic weapons testing, asking the U.S. government to reconsider.
    According to the United States' strange view, it seems that raising the urgent international issue of considering the conclusion of an agreement to cease atomic weapons testing during the U.S. election period is not appropriate, and is even "contrary to recognized international practice." But this is untenable and obviously unreasonable. Efforts to seek solutions to international problems should not be shelved simply because the United States is conducting an election campaign, or because these issues are becoming points of contention in the campaign.
    As Bulganin pointed out in his letter, at present, not only the whole world, but also the United States, is seeing increasingly strong calls to avoid the possible consequences of the current atomic arms race. It is only natural that this demand is reflected in the U.S. election campaign and becomes the most prominent and acute issue. But it would be wrong to simply describe this situation as a matter of partisan struggle in the U.S. election. Ending the atomic arms race and eliminating the threat of atomic war are related to the urgent and fundamental interests of people of all countries, including the American people. They have long expressed deep unease about the U.S. government's rejection of the proposals of the Soviet Union, India, Yugoslavia, and other countries to conclude an agreement to cease atomic weapons testing, and about the U.S. continuing to expand the atomic arms race. The "Washington Post" once admitted that "our (referring to the United States) military and political authorities are so keen on large-scale nuclear weapons that they are unwilling to consider our own interests in an international agreement controlling nuclear weapons testing," and that this rigid approach by the United States has put the United States "in an extremely unfavorable position" in the eyes of world opinion.
    However, the U.S. government now shows that it is still unwilling to respect the strong demands of public opinion, make a more realistic assessment of the situation, and extricate itself from the difficult situation it faces at home and abroad. While the U.S. President's reply stated that it "has been intensively studying, assessing, and planning" methods to stop the arms race and nuclear weapons testing, it insisted on accepting "aerial inspection" as a precondition. Everyone knows that the United States' "aerial inspection" proposal can only exacerbate the arms race, and, moreover, stopping atomic weapons testing does not require solving the issue of international supervision at all, because, due to the development of science and technology, any violation of the agreement and the conduct of atomic weapons explosions will be discovered by other countries. The reason why the United States clings to the "aerial inspection" proposal is nothing more than to block the path of consultation. The U.S. government's recently published policy statement categorically refused to consider stopping atomic weapons testing, and repeated the clichés of the "policy of strength," saying: "Atomic weapons testing has hitherto been - and will continue to be - an indispensable part of our defense (!) plan." This is a stark irony to its vigorous promotion of peace.
    The importance of stopping atomic and hydrogen weapons testing lies in the fact that it will be an important step towards achieving the banning of these weapons. The people of the world will not relax this effort to strive for peace for a minute. The U.S. government's insistence on an opposing attitude can only make it increasingly isolated at home and abroad.

### 苏联的和平动机不容歪曲

    苏联的和平动机不容歪曲
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁，在10月17日写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔，再次表示苏联希望立刻同美国及其他拥有原子武器的国家缔结停止试验原子武器的协定。这是苏联为消除原子战争威胁而作的又一次努力，完全符合于世界各国人民的普遍要求。但是，艾森豪威尔前所未见地迅速作出的答复，不仅没有认真考虑苏联的合理建议，而且轻率地歪曲苏联极为明显的和平动机，硬说苏联的建议“构成了外国对我国内政的干涉。”这是十分令人惊异的。
    美国政府对苏联动机的歪曲，是毫无根据的，苏联一贯主张禁止原子武器和氢武器，停止这些武器的试验。今年7月，苏联最高苏维埃会议除支持日本国会关于禁止原子武器试验的决议以外，批准了苏联外长谢皮洛夫关于苏美英三国缔结停止原子武器试验的协定的建议。同时，苏联和印度、南斯拉夫都曾在联合国裁军会议上为争取停止原子武器试验作了共同的努力。布尔加宁这次给艾森豪威尔的信，也只是重新提出停止原子武器试验的建议，要求美国政府再加考虑。
    依照美国的奇怪观点，似乎在美国竞选期间提出考虑缔结停止原子武器试验协定这样迫切的国际问题，不是适宜的，甚至竟是“违反了公认的国际惯例”。但这是说不通的，而且显然是毫无道理的。谋求国际问题的解决的努力，并不能因为美国在进行竞选运动，或这些问题正在成为竞选中的争论问题，而就应该搁置下来。
    正如布尔加宁信中所指出的，目前不仅全世界，就是在美国，要求避免目前的原子军备竞赛的可能后果的呼声也愈来愈强烈了。这种要求不能不反映到美国竞选运动中，并成为最突出的尖锐问题，这是很自然的。但是如果把这种情况仅仅说成是美国竞选党派之争的问题，那就错了。结束原子军备竞赛，消除原子战争威胁，关联到各国人民（包括美国人民在内）的迫切的根本利益。他们对于美国政府拒绝苏联、印度、南斯拉夫和其他国家要求缔结停止原子武器试验协定的建议，对于美国继续扩大原子军备竞赛，早就表现了深切的不安。“华盛顿邮报”曾经承认，“我们（指美国）的军政当局是这样热中于大型核子武器，以致他们不愿考虑一下我们自己在一个控制核子武器试验的国际协定中的利益”，而美国这种僵硬做法，已使美国在世界舆论面前“处于极其不利的地位”。
    但是，现在美国政府表明它依然不愿尊重舆论的强烈要求，对局势作出较为现实的估计，来解脱它在国内外遭到的困难处境。美国总统的复信虽然表示它“一直在紧张地研究、估量和计划”停止军备竞赛和核子武器试验的方法，但是又坚持必须以接受“空中视察”为先决条件。谁都知道，美国的“空中视察”建议，只能加剧军备竞赛，而且，停止原子武器试验根本就不需要解决国际监督的问题，因为由于科学和技术的发展，任何违反协议、进行原子武器的爆炸，都会为其他国家所发见。美国所以抓住“空中视察”建议不放，无非想借以堵塞协商的道路。美国政府最近发表的政策声明，就断然拒绝考虑停止原子武器试验，并重复了“实力政策”的滥调说：“原子武器试验至今为止——而且继续将是——我国的防御（！）计划的不可缺少的一部分”。这是对它卖力地标榜和平的一个强烈的讽刺。
    停止原子武器和氢武器试验的重要性，在于它将是争取实现禁止这些武器的重要一步。全世界人民一分钟也不会放松这个争取和平的努力。美国政府坚持反对态度，只能使它在国内外日益陷于孤立的境遇。
