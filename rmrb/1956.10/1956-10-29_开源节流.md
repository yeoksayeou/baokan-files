    Increase Revenue and Reduce Expenditure
    Shi Liuming
    This year, the supply of building materials such as steel, iron, and cement is very tight.
    To solve the difficulty of material shortage, some units have taken the initiative to actively find solutions. The Fifth Engineering Company of the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau is doing just that. Originally, the materials supplied to them by the state could only meet 60% of their actual needs, and the remaining 40% relied on their own efforts to find sources and exchange with brother companies. After their active efforts, they overfulfilled their plan, while most construction units under the Northwest Engineering Administration had failed to complete their plans.
    However, some units, because of the material shortage, shouted and screamed, constantly reaching out to higher authorities for solutions, holding the attitude of "anyway, if you don't give me materials, I can't complete the plan, so don't blame me." As a result, production or construction was often delayed because materials could not be allocated or were not allocated in time.
    Of course, this is not to say that when the material supply is insufficient, one should not call out to higher authorities. Problems should be reported to higher authorities in a timely manner, and higher authorities should also find solutions for lower levels. The question is: how to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. To solve the difficulty of material shortage, don't just stare at the higher authorities, waiting for them to solve it. Look around at the neighbors, see if they have any materials that are temporarily not needed or surplus. Because the higher authorities do not know much about the neighbors' material reserves. At the same time, look downwards and mobilize workers and engineering technicians to find solutions. Save what can be saved, and use substitutes whenever possible.

    开源节流

    今年钢、铁、水泥等建筑材料的供不应求，是很突出的。
    为了解决材料缺乏的困难，有些单位主动地积极地想办法。像西北工程管理总局第五工程公司就是这样做的。原来国家供给他们的材料只能满足实际需要的60％，其余40％就靠自己想办法找来源，和兄弟公司调换。经过他们积极努力，结果在西北工程管理局所属大部分建筑单位都没有完成计划的情况下，他们却超额完成了计划。
    但是，有的单位因为材料供不应求，就大叫大喊，一个劲地伸手向上级要办法，抱着“反正你不给材料，计划完不成，怨不得我”的态度。结果往往是由于材料调拨不下来，或者拨得不及时，耽误了生产或施工。
    当然不是说，材料供应不足，不应该向上级叫喊。有问题应该及时向上级反映，上级也应该给下级想办法。问题是：如何开源节流。为了解决材料不足的困难，不要眼睛仅仅是瞧着上级，垂手等待上级给解决，而眼睛同时向四邻看一看，看邻人有没有暂时用不着的或者多余的材料。因为四邻储备材料的事，上级也是不大了解的。同时眼睛还要向下，动员工人、工程技术人员想办法。能省的就省，能用代用品的就用代用品。
