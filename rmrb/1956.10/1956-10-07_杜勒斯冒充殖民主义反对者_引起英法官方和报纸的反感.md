Xinhua News Agency, 6th, New York dispatch: French Foreign Minister Pineau's spokesman stated on the evening of the 5th that he welcomed U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's expression of support for the Anglo-French proposal and the so-called Eighteen-Nation proposal of the London Conference that day at the United Nations Security Council. At the same time, he expressed dissatisfaction with Dulles's statement that the United States' approach to colonialism differed from that of Britain and France. He said that on this issue, "the basic feeling is that the United States has a so-called anti-colonial policy, a fact which sometimes may endanger the spirit of freedom that we hope to promote."

The spokesman believed that the interests of Britain, France, and the United States were consistent on the issue of colonialism. He asked: "From the point of view of American interests, what does the United States gain by letting Britain withdraw from the Suez Canal Zone?"

A British Foreign Office spokesman, in response to a barrage of questions about Dulles's remarks, said his only comment was that he saw no "discrepancy" between Eden's initial interpretation of the "Suez Canal Users Association" and Dulles's later proposal at the Second London Conference. According to UPI, there were "strong indications in London that Dulles's remarks were somewhat embarrassing." UPI said diplomats believed that on the eve of the United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss the Suez dispute, "his remarks were really untimely."

Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch: TASS, 4th dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's remarks at a press conference on October 2 regarding the Suez Canal issue have angered British and French newspapers because Dulles hypocritically stated in his remarks that the United States' approach to issues related to colonialism differed from that of Britain and France.

The British "Truth" weekly said that Dulles was not qualified to lecture about colonialism because the United States monopolizes the Panama Canal Zone, and "the entire history of the Panama Canal is a vivid example of colonialism."

The French "Le Monde" wrote: "Many French people felt angry when they read this speech by the U.S. Secretary of State" because Dulles, "influenced by the election campaign," was attempting to play "the role of a revealer of colonialism." It said that Dulles's speech proved that "the unity of the Atlantic alliance has never been more ineffective than it is now."

The French "Combat" also mocked Dulles's attempt to pose as an "opponent of colonialism."

    杜勒斯冒充殖民主义反对者  引起英法官方和报纸的反感
    新华社6日讯　纽约消息：法国外交部长比诺的发言人5日晚上对美国国务卿杜勒斯这一天在联合国安全理事会上表示支持英法提案和伦敦会议的所谓十八国建议表示欢迎。同时，他对杜勒斯关于美国在殖民主义问题上的作法同英法有所不同的说法表示不满。他说，在这个问题上，“基本的感觉是：美国有一种所谓反殖民主义政策，这个事实有时候可能危害我们希望发扬的自由精神”。
    这个发言人认为，在殖民主义问题上，英法美三国的利益是一致的。他问道：“从美国利益的观点来看，美国让英国从苏伊士运河区撤退，自己得到什么益处了呢？”
    英国外交部发言人在回答一大堆关于杜勒斯谈话的问题的时候说，他唯一的意见是：他看不出艾登第一次对“苏伊士运河使用国协会”的解释和杜勒斯后来在第二次伦敦会议上提出的意见之间有什么
  “分歧”。据合众社说，伦敦“有强烈的迹象表明，对杜勒斯的谈话有点难堪”。合众社说，外交官们认为，在联合国安全理事会开会讨论苏伊士争端的前夕，“他的谈话实在不合时宜”。
    据新华社6日讯　据塔斯社4日讯：美国国务卿杜勒斯10月2日在记者招待会上就苏伊士运河问题发表的谈话激怒了英法两国报纸，因为杜勒斯在谈话中伪善地表示美国在同殖民主义有关的问题上的做法同英法两国有分歧。
    英国的“真理”周刊说，杜勒斯不配对殖民主义大发议论，因为美国独霸着巴拿马运河区，而“巴拿马运河的全部历史是殖民主义的鲜明例子”。
    法国“世界报”写道：“许多法国人在读到美国国务卿的这篇谈话的时候，都感到愤怒。”因为“受到竞选影响”的杜勒斯竟然企图扮演“殖民主义的揭露者的角色”。它说，杜勒斯的讲话证明，“大西洋联盟的团结从来没有比现在更加无效的了”。
    法国“战斗报”也讥笑杜勒斯企图装出“殖民主义的反对者”的姿态。
