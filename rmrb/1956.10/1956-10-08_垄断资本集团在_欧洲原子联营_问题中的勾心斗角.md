The Infighting of Monopoly Capital Groups over the "European Atomic Energy Community" Issue
乐山

For two years, the diplomats of the "Coal and Steel Community" group of Western European countries, the decision-makers of the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau," the supporters of the European unification movement, and all kinds of politicians have been constantly touting the so-called "European Atomic Energy Community Plan." They have held meeting after meeting, and put forward various drafts and legislation, but so far there have been no concrete results.

Three Major Plans

In May 1954, French industrialist Louis Armand submitted a proposal to the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau," requesting the rapid establishment of an "Atomic Research" organization. The "European Economic Cooperation Bureau" adopted Armand's proposal and established a committee for research. This was the beginning of the "European Atomic Energy Community" plan.

In June 1955, the foreign ministers of the six countries of the European "Coal and Steel Community" group held a meeting in Messina, Italy, to discuss the plan proposed by Armand, and decided to establish an "Intergovernmental Committee" headed by Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak for research. In November 1955, the committee approved Armand's plan and began to study the joint organization. This proposed organization was called the "European Atomic Energy Community Organization."

The Messina plan stipulated the establishment of a fund provided by the six countries, a common market for the supply of atomic materials and atomic equipment, and shared research centers, etc. The atomic energy industries of these six countries would be controlled by a high-level agency. However, Armand's plan deliberately did not specify the authority and power of this agency.

Another major plan was put forward by the "Action Committee for the United States of Europe" organized by Western European politicians. Its chairman was Monnet of France, the former chairman of the "High Authority" of the "Coal and Steel Community." In January of this year, the "Action Committee for the United States of Europe" held a meeting in Paris and passed a resolution to establish a European Atomic Energy Community organization "with supranational powers." The signatories of the resolution also guaranteed to strive to get their national parliaments and governments to pass corresponding decisions. The parliaments of West Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands have successively expressed their support for this resolution.

The third major plan was put forward by three experts from the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau." It was discussed by the Council of the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau" in February of this year. This plan requires a more loose cooperation among the seventeen member states of the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau"—including the six countries of the "Coal and Steel Community"—and avoids "supranational" claims. The plan only stipulates that the countries participating in the joint venture should exchange information, expertise, and experts, and does not stipulate the formulation of a common budget, the establishment of joint venture factories, and the implementation of control measures.

Under the Smoke Screen of "Peace"

No matter which plan or proposal it is, they all claim that their purpose is to promote the peaceful use and cooperation of atomic energy. However, Armand revealed one of the thoughts in the minds of these planners when he gave an interview to the French "Le Figaro" newspaper, saying: "Whoever can produce atomic energy can make atomic bombs." The Western European monopoly capital groups did not forget the military purpose when they planned to organize the "Atomic Energy Community." Therefore, the resolution passed by the "Coal and Steel Community" six-nation foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels in February 1956 declared that the establishment of the European Atomic Energy Community organization would not prevent any of its member states from manufacturing atomic bombs. At the Venice conference held at the end of May, these countries more openly demanded that the Atomic Energy Community organization be able to jointly produce atomic weapons.

Another purpose of organizing the "Atomic Energy Community" is that the monopoly capital groups of these "small European" countries are eager to catch up in the profitable new enterprise of atomic energy production. In the capitalist world, American monopoly capital groups now control the largest part of the production, raw materials, resources, and markets of atomic energy. British monopoly capital groups have also achieved important development in this regard, but France is far behind, not to mention West Germany and other small Western European countries that are restricted by international agreements after the war. The monopoly capitalists of the countries on the European continent are absolutely unwilling to accept this. They attempt to form some kind of international cartel of atomic energy to strengthen their own competitiveness. Strauss, the Minister of Atomic Energy Development of West Germany, revealed this anxiety and the desire for so-called cooperation: "West Germany is fifteen years behind in the development of atomic energy. In order to make up for this time, it is necessary to strengthen international cooperation, mainly with other European countries." This is how the clamor for the "Atomic Energy Community" plan came about.

America's "Concern" and "Support"

As soon as the "European Atomic Energy Community" plan was conceived, it aroused great concern in Washington. Dulles expressed support for this kind of joint venture at the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council in December 1955. The United States does not intend to reject any plan, but it especially favors Monnet's "supranational" plan.

Why does the United States actively support the "European Atomic Energy Community" so enthusiastically? Needless to say, it has its own selfish intentions. American monopoly capitalists want to use this "European Atomic Energy Community" organization to facilitate the control of the atomic industries of European countries. In this regard, American monopoly capital holds favorable conditions.

American consortiums control the uranium ore products of the Belgian Congo. According to a report in the Dortmund "West German Daily," the uranium in the Belgian Congo accounts for more than half of the output in the Western world, and cobalt accounts for about three-quarters. The "European Atomic Energy Community" must purchase uranium from the Americans. This means that the "European Atomic Energy Community" will have an American rope around its neck, which will open up a huge source of profits for American monopoly capitalists.

The plans of American monopoly capital do not stop there. The French business journal "Prospects Weekly" pointed out: the United States will also "dominate the foreign policy of this joint venture organization and the six countries participating in the joint venture. ... (This joint venture plan) will subordinate the entire future of Europe to the interests of the United States, or more precisely, to the military goals of the American extreme right wing."

Britain's Plans

Britain has not expressed a clear attitude towards the "European Atomic Energy Community," but it cannot be said that its concern is less than that of other countries. In this regard, there is a particularly deep contradiction between the United States and Britain. Just like Britain's plan to organize a Western European "free trade zone," British monopoly capitalists also want to open up their atomic product market in Europe through some kind of "joint venture," and not let American monopoly capitalists monopolize this great business.

However, Britain firmly opposes the supranational nature of the "Atomic Energy Community," because a joint venture of this nature will be easily controlled by the United States, and the British atomic industry will also be restricted and squeezed out. It is precisely because of Britain's opposition that the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau" produced the third plan mentioned above. Britain welcomed this plan, believing that it provided a good opportunity for European "free trade."

France's Wrong Path

French monopoly capitalists actively support the "European Atomic Energy Community" plan, because in terms of atomic energy development, France lags behind the United States and Britain, but greatly exceeds the other member states of the proposed Atomic Energy Community organization. In terms of developing atomic energy, France has spent three times more money than the other five countries combined. Therefore, in the eyes of French monopoly capitalists, they will have the main say in this kind of joint venture organization, and they will be able to use this favorable condition to control the market of the "European Atomic Energy Community" organization.

The "European Atomic Energy Community" plan has aroused fierce opposition from the French people, including some of the bourgeoisie. "L'Humanité" has long pointed out that the Atomic Energy Community organization is regarded as a supplementary organization to the European "Coal and Steel Community" group, and the establishment of the latter "has already brought tragic consequences to France, because it has guaranteed West Germany's economic hegemony in Western Europe and damaged France." The Radical Socialist Party's "Combat" has also sharply criticized this plan many times, believing it to be a "German-American conspiracy." "Combat" said: "The European Atomic Energy Community organization will allow Germany to manufacture atomic bombs in five years, although this violates the Paris Agreement. This will abolish the last guarantee France has obtained."

However, the French National Assembly, ignoring the opposition of the people, passed the proposal on participating in the "European Atomic Energy Community Organization" supported by the French government by a majority vote on July 11, 1956.

West Germany's Wishful Thinking

West Germany is currently behind France in terms of atomic energy development. However, West German monopoly capitalists estimate that by participating in the "Atomic Energy Community," West Germany can obtain atomic reactors, specialized technical knowledge, and technical experts. Using this joint venture, West Germany can bypass the restrictions of international agreements and produce atomic weapons. Moreover, due to West Germany's industrial and financial superiority over France, and with the support of the United States, West Germany will eventually occupy a leading position in the Atomic Energy Community organization.

However, at present, West German monopoly capitalists, in view of their backwardness in atomic energy, are unwilling to go too fast and too far in terms of joint ventures, so they also oppose the supranational nature of the "Atomic Energy Community" and require it to be limited to some "cooperation" that will only benefit them. A report in the Paris "International Forum" pointed out: West Germany believes that the powers of the "European Atomic Energy Community" should be strictly limited and should be used to coordinate intelligence, researchers, and subsidies. According to people in Bonn, this organization should absorb some funds and direct technical assistance from the United States. West Germany will be able to greatly benefit from these arrangements. People in Bonn believe that when competition occurs in the future, West Germany's technical advantages will guarantee its victory.

Therefore, it is very obvious that the planning of the "European Atomic Energy Community" is fundamentally different from the international cooperation for the peaceful use of atomic energy that is currently being carried out. The people of Western Europe and the world all demand to take the path of international cooperation for the peaceful use of atomic energy, and oppose the path of serving the interests of monopoly capital groups and causing an atomic arms race as shown by the "European Atomic Energy Community" plan.

    垄断资本集团在“欧洲原子联营”问题中的勾心斗角
    乐山
    两年以来，西欧“煤钢联营”集团国家的外交家、“欧洲经济合作局”的决策者、欧洲统一运动的拥护者以及形形色色的政客，不断地鼓吹所谓“欧洲原子联营计划”。他们举行了一次又一次的会议，提出了各种各样的草案和立法，可是迄今还没有什么具体的结果。
    三个主要的计划
    1954年5月，法国工业家路易·阿蒙向“欧洲经济合作局”提出建议，要求迅速成立一个“原子研究”机构。“欧洲经济合作局”采纳了阿蒙的建议，设立委员会进行研究。这就是“欧洲原子联营”计划的开始。
    1955年6月，欧洲“煤钢联营”集团六国外交部长在意大利墨西拿举行会议，讨论了阿蒙提出的计划，决定设立以比利时外交大臣斯巴克为首的“各国政府间委员会”进行研究。1955年11月该委员会赞同了阿蒙的计划，着手研究联营组织。这个拟议中的组织，就被称为“欧洲原子联营组织”。
    墨西拿计划规定设立一项由六国提供的资金，一个供应原子物质和原子装备的共同市场以及共有的研究中心等等。这六个国家的原子能工业将受一个高级机构的控制。可是，阿蒙的计划却故意没有规定这个机构的权限和权力。
    另一个主要的计划，是由西欧政客们组织的“欧洲合众国行动委员会”提出来的。它的主席是“煤钢联营”的“高级机构”前任主席、法国的摩纳。今年1月，“欧洲合众国行动委员会”在巴黎举行会议，通过了设立“具有超国家权力”的欧洲原子联营组织的决议，在决议上签名的人并保证努力促使他们国家的议会和政府通过相应的决定。西德、比利时、荷兰的议会已先后表示赞成这个决议。
    第三个主要的计划，是由“欧洲经济合作局”的三个专家提出的。今年2月曾由“欧洲经济合作局”的理事会加以讨论。这个计划要求“欧洲经济合作局”的十七个成员国——其中包括“煤钢联营”的六个国家——进行一种比较散漫的合作，而且避免了“超国家”的主张。计划只规定参加联营的国家进行情报、专门知识、专家的交换，没有规定制定共同预算、建立联营工厂和实行管制等办法。
    在“和平”的烟幕下
    不论是哪一种计划或建议，都标榜它们的目的是为了促进原子能的和平用途和合作。但是阿蒙在对法国“费加罗报”发表谈话时，道出了这些策划人心中的一种想法，他说：“谁能生产原子能，谁就能制造原子弹。”西欧垄断资本集团策划组织“原子能联营”，并没有忘记军事的目的。所以1956年2月“煤钢联营”六国外长布鲁塞尔会议通过的决议中就宣称：欧洲原子联营组织的建立将不阻止它的任何成员国制造原子弹。这些国家在5月底举行的威尼斯会议上，更公开要求原子联营机构能联合生产原子武器。
    组织“原子联营”的另一个目的，是这些“小欧洲”各国的垄断资本集团急于想在原子能生产这个有利可图的新企业方面迎头赶上。在资本主义世界中，现在美国垄断资本集团控制着最大部分原子能的生产、原料、资源和市场，英国垄断资本集团在这方面也已经获得了重要发展，但是法国则远远落在后面，至于战后受到国际协定约束的西德以及其他西欧小国，更不必说了。西欧大陆各国的垄断资本家，对这是绝不甘心的。它们企图组成某种原子能的国际卡特尔来加强本身的竞争能力。西德原子能发展部长施特劳斯道出了这种不安情绪和所谓合作的愿望：“西德在发展原子能方面迟了十五年，为了弥补这段时间，就有必要加强国际合作，主要是和其他欧洲国家的合作。”“原子联营”计划的鼓噪，就是这样来的。
    美国的“关心”和“支持”
    “欧洲原子联营”计划一想出，就引起华盛顿的极大关心。杜勒斯曾在北大西洋公约组织理事会1955年12月巴黎会议上表示支持这种联营。美国并不打算拒绝任何一个计划，但它特别赞成摩纳的“超国家”计划。
    为什么美国居然这样积极地支持“欧洲原子联营”呢？不用说有其自私的打算。美国垄断资本家是想利用这个“欧洲原子联营”的组织，以便于控制欧洲各国的原子工业。而在这方面，美国垄断资本握有有利的条件。
    美国财团控制着比属刚果的铀矿产品。据多特蒙德的“西德日报”的报道，比属刚果的铀占西方世界产量的一半以上，钴约占四分之三。“欧洲原子联营”必须向美国人购买铀。这就意味着，“欧洲原子联营”的脖子将套上一根美国绳索，将为美国垄断资本家开辟巨大利润的源泉。
    美国垄断资本的打算还不止于此。法国商业界机关报“展望周报”指出：美国还将“支配这个联营机构和参加联营的六个国家的外交政策。……（这个联营计划）将使欧洲的整个前途从属于美国的利益，或更确切地说，从属于美国极右派的军事目的。”
    英国的打算
    英国对“欧洲原子联营”一直没有表示明确的态度，但决不能说它的关心会比别的国家差。在这方面，美、英之间存在着特别深刻的矛盾。正如英国筹组西欧“自由贸易区域”的打算一样，英国垄断资本家也想通过某种“联营”开辟它在欧洲的原子产品市场，不让美国垄断资本家独占这笔大好生意。
    但是英国坚决反对“原子联营”的超国家性质，因为这种性质的联营将易于被美国所控制，使英国原子工业也受到约束和排挤。正是由于英国的反对，“欧洲经济合作局”才产生了上面提到的第三种计划。英国对此计划表示欢迎，认为它为欧洲的“自由贸易”提供了一个良好的机会。
    法国的歧路
    法国垄断资本家是积极支持“欧洲原子联营”计划的，因为在原子能的发展方面，法国比美英落后，却大大超过了拟议中的原子联营组织的其他成员国。在发展原子能方面，法国所花的钱，比其他五个国家所花的总数多三倍。因此，在法国垄断资本家看来，在这种联营组织中他们将得到主要的发言权，他们将能够利用这个有利的条件来控制“欧洲原子联营”组织的市场。
    “欧洲原子联营”计划引起了法国人民包括一部分资产阶级的猛烈反对。“人道报”早已指出，原子联营组织被当作欧洲“煤钢联营”集团的一个补充组织，而后者的建立“已经给法国带来了悲惨的后果，因为它保证了西德在西欧的经济霸权而损害了法国。”激进社会党的“战斗报”也多次尖锐地抨击这个计划，认为它是一种“德美阴谋”。“战斗报”说：“欧洲原子联营组织将允许德国在五年中制造原子弹，虽然这是违反巴黎协定的。这将废除法国所得到的最后一点保证。”
    可是，法国国民议会不顾人民的反对，已在1956年7月11日以多数通过了法政府支持的关于参加“欧洲原子联营组织”的提案。
    西德的如意算盘
    西德目前在原子能发展方面是比法国落后。但是西德垄断资本家估计到，参加了“原子联营”，西德就可以得到原子反应堆、专门技术知识与技术专家。利用这个联营，西德就可以绕过国际协定的限制，生产原子武器。而且由于西德工业与财政经济上对法国的优势，同时又有美国的支持，西德最后将在原子联营组织里居于主导地位。
    不过，目前西德垄断资本家鉴于自己在原子能方面的落后，不愿意在联营方面走得太快太远，所以也反对“原子联营”的超国家性质，而要求限于一些只会对他们有利的“合作”。巴黎“国际论坛”的报道指出：西德认为，“欧洲原子联营”的职权应该是严格有限的，并且应该用来统筹情报、研究员和补助金。按照波恩人士的意见，这个组织应该吸取美国某些经费和直接技术援助。从这些安排中，西德将能大大获利。波恩人士相信，等到将来发生竞争时，西德在技术上的优势将保证它获胜。
    因此，很明显，“欧洲原子联营”的策划，是同目前正在开展的和平利用原子能的国际合作根本不相同的。西欧和全世界人民都要求走和平利用原子能国际合作的道路，反对走“欧洲原子联营”计划所表现出来的这种为垄断资本集团利益服务、会引起原子军备竞赛的道路。
