Agricultural Science Work Must Closely Link with Reality
　　Chen Fengtong, Director of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute

The cooperative movement led by our Party among the nation's peasants has achieved a decisive victory, thereby promoting an unprecedented production upsurge. In recent years, state-owned farms and cooperatives have created numerous experiences of large-scale high yields, driving the overall improvement of agricultural production. The people of the whole country, including agricultural scientists, have been greatly encouraged by this. However, to achieve the goal set by the Party Central Committee in the draft National Agricultural Development Program of doubling our agricultural products from the current level in the next twelve years, and to ensure the stability in quantity and improvement in quality, the task is arduous. Achieving this task requires not only the hard work of the nation's farmers but also extremely heavy and complex scientific and technological work by agricultural scientists across the country.

Our Party has always valued agricultural science. In the past, when we established revolutionary base areas in rural areas, we extensively recruited experts to carry out agricultural scientific research, which played a certain role in developing agricultural production in the base areas and ensuring military and civilian supplies. After the national liberation, the Party further strengthened its leadership over agricultural science. With the support of the people and the enthusiastic participation of scientists, a nationwide agricultural scientific experiment and research network is being established. Agricultural scientific research departments and agricultural scientific workers, based on the strict regional nature of agricultural production and the requirements of the vast number of agricultural production cooperative members, have combined with local extension stations and key cooperatives to conduct scientific research, solve problems raised in production, and have also achieved certain results. The existing shortcomings mainly lie in ideological and working methods, and there is still a tendency towards dogmatism that is divorced from reality.

In response to this situation, we must pay attention to the following issues in the future:

First, our agricultural scientists must never forget to serve the needs of agricultural production. We must be good at closely combining agricultural scientific work with the requirements of the country and cooperatives to improve production; good at summarizing and improving mass experiences, thereby enriching scientific knowledge and enhancing research capabilities; and at the same time, be good at understanding actual needs from production and accumulating scientific data to properly define research tasks. In the context of the extreme lack of agricultural scientific research data and the varying agricultural production conditions in different regions constrained by natural conditions, anyone who does not pay attention to this will commit the subjective error of being divorced from reality. We have learned many lessons in this regard in the past.

Second, we must be good at solving the contradiction between the heavy workload and the lack of technical cadres. Agricultural science is a science that fights against nature, and nature is constantly changing. Often, just as we have eliminated one kind of germ or pest, new germs or pests emerge; moreover, the same kind of pest also undergoes "improvisational" changes in its struggle for survival. For some agricultural pests, we have not yet found satisfactory control methods, and some have not even mastered their activity patterns. For example, the devastating wheat gall midge lives deep below the tillage layer. If we want to eliminate them from the cultivation method, we need to avoid continuous wheat planting for seven years. Another example is the wheat yellow dwarf virus, we still do not know where it overwinters. Therefore, under the current conditions of a lack of technical cadres, to enable agricultural science to serve agricultural production more effectively and to develop itself, we must adopt a working method that concentrates efforts to solve major problems; that is to say, we must, in a focused and planned manner, combine various departments of agricultural science to solve problems comprehensively. Otherwise, if everyone does their own thing, the limited technical strength will be dispersed, and our work will be busy and passive, achieving half the results with twice the effort.

Third, we must resolutely correct the dogmatism we committed in the past when learning Michurin biology and the lack of humility in treating scientific achievements of capitalist countries; we must be good at critically absorbing international scientific achievements and be good at analyzing the scientific propositions of different schools of thought, applying the useful parts to our work to enhance our working strength.

Fourth, we must strengthen and establish weak and blank scientific departments. Research on agricultural meteorology, underground hydrogeology, physiology, biochemistry, genetics, and atomic energy, as well as research on agricultural mechanization, electrification, and the upcoming large-scale new irrigation areas, should gradually draw certain manpower and resources to carry out.

At the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai put forward high demands on scientific work; this marks that our country's scientific work is embarking on a new stage. Further strengthening the Party's leadership over scientific work and launching agricultural science learning and research has become a very urgent and very serious task. We request that a national agricultural science leading body be established as soon as possible to strengthen the leadership over national agricultural scientific research work; we must also strengthen international agricultural scientific activities and contacts to rapidly improve our country's scientific level. We have the selfless help of scientists from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. As long as we do not commit dogmatic errors, our work will achieve twice the results with half the effort. As the scope of scientific and technological cooperation in the world expands day by day, advanced scientific theories and experiences will soon be transmitted to us; as long as we are humble and do not commit sectarian errors, our scientific level can be rapidly improved. Under the correct leadership and constant care of the Party and the government, we should strengthen our confidence and redouble our efforts to complete the glorious scientific research tasks.

　　农业科学工作必须密切联系实际
    华北农业科学研究所所长　陈凤桐
    我们党领导全国农民进行的合作化运动，已取得决定性的胜利，并由此推动起空前未有的生产高潮。近几年来，在国营农场和合作社内，已创造出许许多多的大面积丰产经验，带动了农业生产的全面提高。全国人民、包括农业科学工作者在内，都因此受到了极大的鼓舞。但是，要达到党中央所提出农业发展纲要（草案）中所提出的，在今后十二年内把我国的农产品从现在的水平增加到两倍的要求，并且要使它数量上稳定、质量上提高，任务是很艰巨的。实现这个任务，不仅要依靠全国农民的辛勤劳动，而且需要有全国农业科学工作者进行极繁重、极复杂的科学技术工作。
    我们党从来是重视农业科学的。过去我们在农村建立革命根据地的时候，就多方延聘专家，进行农业科学的研究工作，对发展根据地的农业生产，保证军需民食，起过一定的作用。全国解放后，党更加强了对农业科学的领导，在全国人民的支持和科学家的热烈参加下，正在建立着全国规模的农业科学试验研究网。农业科学研究部门和农业科学工作人员，根据农业生产的严格区域性和广大农业生产合作社社员的要求，结合当地推广站和重点社进行科学研究，解决生产上所提出的问题，也取得了一定的成绩。现存的缺点，主要是在思想方法和工作方法上，还有脱离实际的教条主义倾向。
    针对这种情况，今后我们必须注意以下几个问题：
    一、我们农业科学工作者，一天也不能忘记为农业生产上的需要服务。要善于把农业科学工作同国家的和合作社的提高生产的要求密切结合起来；善于总结和提高群众经验，借以丰富科学知识，增强研究能力；同时，还要善于从生产中了解实际需要，积累科学资料，以便恰当地规定研究任务。在农业科学研究资料极端缺乏和各地农业生产情况不尽相同并受自然条件限制的情况下，谁不重视这一点，谁就会犯脱离实际的主观主义的错误。过去我们在这方面的教训是很多的。
    二、我们要善于解决任务繁重与技术干部缺乏的矛盾。农业科学是和自然作斗争的科学，而自然界则是不断地变化着的。往往是我们刚刚消灭了这一种病菌或虫害，又发生了新的病菌或虫害；而且，同一种病虫在它的生活斗争中，也进行着“随机应变”的变化。对于有些农业病虫害，我们至今还没有找到满意的除治方法，有的甚至还没有掌握到它的活动规律，例如带毁灭性的小麦吸浆虫，深居在耕作层的下边，若从耕作方法上消灭它们，需要在七年之内不连种小麦才能做到。又如小麦黄疸病菌，我们到现在还不知道它在什么地方越夏。因此，在目前技术干部缺乏的条件下，要使农业科学更有效地为农业生产服务，并使它本身有所发展，就必须采取集中力量解决主要问题的工作方法；也就是说，必须有重点地有计划地使农业科学各部门结合起来，综合地解决问题。否则，各干各的，有限的技术力量分散了，我们的工作就会忙乱被动，事倍功半。
    三、我们必须切实纠正以往在学习米丘林生物学的时候所犯的教条主义和对待资本主义国家科学成就方面不虚心的态度；要善于批判地吸收国际上的科学成就和善于分析不同学派的科学主张，把其中有用的部分，应用到我们的工作中来，以增强我们的工作力量。
    四、我们必须加强和建立薄弱的和空白的科学部门。对农业气象、地下水文地质、生理、生化、遗传和原子能等科学的研究，以及对农业机械化、电气化和即将到来的大面积的新灌溉区的研究等等，都应当逐渐抽出一定的人力、物力来进行。
    在中国共产党第八次全国代表大会上，刘少奇同志和周恩来同志的报告，都对科学工作提出了很高的要求；这标志着我国的科学工作，正在走上新的阶段。进一步加强党对科学工作的领导，展开农业科学的学习和研究，已经是十分紧迫十分严重的任务了。我们要求及早建立起全国农业科学的领导机关，加强对全国农业科学研究工作的领导；还要加强国际农业科学的活动和联系，以迅速提高我国的科学水平。我们有苏联和其他兄弟国家科学家无私的帮助，只要我们不犯教条主义的错误，我们的工作就会事半功倍。由于世界上科学技术合作的范围日益扩大，国际上先进科学理论和经验很快就会传到我们这里来；只要我们虚心，不犯宗派主义的错误，我们的科学水平是可以迅速提高的。我们应当在党和政府的正确领导和不断关怀下，加强信心，加倍努力，来完成光荣的科学研究任务。
