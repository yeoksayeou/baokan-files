Comrade Luo Tian, First Secretary of the Shantou Regional Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Guangdong Province, spoke as follows:

    I will now make a speech on how the Shantou region has achieved high grain yield increases:
  　One of the main characteristics of the Shantou area is its large population, limited land, and surplus labor. According to the 1955 statistics, the total area of ​​paddy and dry land in the region was 6,558,565 mu, with an agricultural population of 6,090,900 people, averaging only 1.0767 mu of land per person. In the Chaoshan Plain, this figure is less than one mu, and the surplus labor force is even more serious. According to typical surveys, surplus labor accounts for nearly 30% of the rural population in addition to those engaged in agricultural production. Therefore, after the realization of agricultural cooperativization throughout the region, how to effectively solve the problem of a large surplus labor force, ensure that agricultural cooperatives can increase production more, and that members can increase their income year by year, has become the most important issue for members and the most prominent issue for consolidating agricultural cooperatives.
  　Since liberation, especially after the end of land reform and the transition to agricultural production increase movements centered on agricultural cooperativization, agricultural production in the Shantou region, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, has relied on mutual aid and cooperation organizations (mainly agricultural cooperatives) and the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants. Measures were taken to vigorously build water conservancy projects, prevent and control pests and diseases, improve soil, promote improved varieties, and universally carry out cultivation technology reforms centered on close planting with small seedlings. Efforts were made to cultivate strong seedlings, carefully prepare the land (in the Chaoshan Plain, each crop is typically plowed once, turned once, and harrowed ten times), transplant seedlings in a timely manner, inspect and replant seedlings, apply fertilizer rationally, irrigate and drain rationally, and promote new-style farm tools, improve the farming system, and increase the multiple cropping index, which greatly unlocked the potential of the land and increased yields per unit area. In 1955, after overcoming the historically rare threat of a continuous drought of more than 150 days, Chao'an and Chenghai counties became double-cropping rice "thousand-catty counties," and Chaoyang became a grain "thousand-catty county". Chao'an County has achieved bumper rice harvests year after year since liberation. The average yield per mu was 577 catties in 1949, 587 catties in 1950, 647.32 catties in 1951, 750.24 catties in 1952, 818.46 catties in 1953, 951.48 catties in 1954, and 1,017.34 catties in 1955, transforming it from a grain-deficient county to a grain-surplus county. Even in Jieyang, where rice production suffered from serious attacks by five major disasters—drought, alkalinity, pests, wind, and cold—large-scale bumper harvests were achieved in some areas, with five "thousand-catty districts," seventy-five "thousand-catty townships," and one hundred and ninety-three "thousand-catty cooperatives," while the Dongfang Sheng Agricultural Cooperative achieved an average yield of 1,425.4 catties per mu for its entire cooperative's 500 mu of double-cropping rice. The Yunguang Cooperative, led by Comrade Lin Yancheng, had two mu of high-yield fields with an average yield of 2,020 catties per mu. This year, with the full realization of cooperativization in early rice production, the three major measures of increasing production—water conservancy construction, technological transformation, and increased fertilizer application—were further implemented, eliminating the threat of general drought and flood disasters in 80% of the area. More than 660 million dan of native and miscellaneous fertilizers were accumulated (equivalent to about 100 dan of native and miscellaneous fertilizers per mu). At the same time, 130,000 agricultural technology researchers were trained and organized in agricultural cooperatives as the backbone force for promoting and improving technological transformation, and close planting of small seedlings was implemented on about 97% of the rice area (of which single and double seedling close planting accounted for 20%), resulting in a bumper harvest. The total output of the region increased by 23% compared with last year, and the output per unit area increased by 16%. The 1.45 mu of high-yield fields of the Hongguang Advanced Cooperative in the suburbs of Shantou City achieved a yield of 1,047.4 catties per mu, and the Nanhai Advanced Cooperative in Chaoyang, which has barren land, achieved an average yield of 752 catties per mu, an increase of 20% over last year.
　　Thousands of facts have proven that although the Shantou area has a large population and limited land, and agricultural mechanization has not yet been realized, grain output is already relatively high. However, as long as agricultural cooperatives are specifically organized on the basis of agricultural cooperativization to fully develop agricultural production and sideline production, and various production increase measures are universally implemented, and the problem of a large surplus labor force is solved, the huge labor potential and land potential of rural areas are brought into full play, it is entirely possible to achieve higher yields on the basis of high yields. The arguments that "a large population is a burden, and the potential of high-yield areas has reached its limit" are completely wrong. The Xingfu Cooperative in Futang Township, Chao'an, provides a good example in this regard: In addition to carrying out production according to the original agricultural and sideline production plans and labor plans, the cooperative also organized surplus labor to reclaim wasteland in Huangtian Mountain (450 mu have been reclaimed, and 343 mu have been planted with cassava, peanuts, flax, sweet potatoes, pineapples, tangerines, lemons, peaches, etc.; 650 mu of forests have also been planted), expanded the cooperative's animal husbandry production, developed the cooperative's processing, transportation, and handicrafts, and in order to reduce agricultural production costs, determined to accumulate three times more native and miscellaneous fertilizers than originally planned (requiring an increase of 25,140 workdays), completely solving the problem of the entire cooperative's 65,488 surplus workdays; at the same time, meticulous farming was carried out in agriculture, and various production increase measures were fully implemented, so that various crops generally achieved production increases in the first half of the year, namely: 309 mu of rice, with an output of 547 catties per mu, an increase of 30% compared with last year; 1,124 mu of peanuts, with an output of 365 catties per mu, an increase of 13% compared with last year; 154 mu of jute, with an output of 717 catties per mu, an increase of 30.3% compared with last year; 644 mu of sweet potatoes, with an output of 2,670 catties per mu, an increase of 33.5% compared with last year; and other crops such as taro also increased production. The results of the early crop pre-distribution (distributed solely from agricultural income of 142,539 yuan) showed that each workday was worth 1.6 yuan, and the average income per household was 171.4 yuan, an increase of 38.4 yuan compared with the income of 133 yuan per household in the primary cooperative last year. Of the 547 households in the cooperative, 524 households, accounting for more than 95% of the total number of households, increased their income compared with before joining the cooperative. Facts show that as long as each agricultural cooperative can implement the direction of the Xingfu Cooperative in a way that is suitable for local conditions, it is entirely possible to solve the problem of labor force output and further increase the output per unit area, ensuring increased income for cooperative members.
  　Last winter and this spring, after the great development of agricultural cooperativization, we once made the mistake of emphasizing grain and neglecting economic crops and sideline production; after the spring plowing, with the correct instructions of the Central Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, we began to correct this error. However, at present, the entire region has not yet fully resolved the issue of solving the output of a large labor force, fully leveraging labor potential, developing diversified operations, fully implementing agricultural production increase measures, and ensuring that agricultural cooperatives can fully increase production and cooperative members can increase their income. There are still many shortcomings and errors that we still need to work harder to address in the future.

    汕头地区是怎样获得粮食高额增产的　　  
    中共广东省汕头地方委员会第一书记　罗天同志的发言　　
    我现在仅就汕头地区怎样获得粮食的高额增产作一发言：　
  　人多地少，劳动力过剩，是汕头地区主要特点之一。按照一九五五年全区水旱田耕地面积六百五十五万八千五百六十五亩，农业人口六百零九万零九百人计算，平均每人才有土地一点零七六七亩。而潮汕平原则还不到一亩，劳动力剩余的现象更为严重。根据典型调查，农村中除从事农业生产外，多余劳动力几达百分之三十左右。因此全区在实现农业合作化以后，如何有效地解决大量剩余劳动力的出路，保证农业社能够更多地增加生产，社员能够逐年增加收入，便成为社员最关心和巩固农业社最为突出的问题。
  　解放以来，特别是在结束土地改革，转入开展以农业合作化为中心的农业增产运动后，汕头地区的农业生产，在党中央、广东省委的正确领导下，依靠了互助合作组织（主要是农业社）及广大农民的生产积极性，采取大力兴修水利，防治病虫害，改良土壤，推广良种，普遍开展以小株密植为中心的栽培技术改革，做好培育壮秧、精细整地（潮汕平原每造多为一犁、一翻、十耙）、适时插秧、查苗补苗、合理施肥、合理排灌，以及推广新式农具，改良耕作制度，增加复种指数等主要增产措施的结果，大大地发挥了土地潜力，提高了单位面积产量。一九五五年全区在战胜了历史上罕见的持续一百五十多天的干旱威胁后，还出现了潮安、澄海二个双季水稻千斤县和一个粮食千斤县（潮阳）。潮安县在解放后连年获得水稻丰收，一九四九年每亩平均产量五百七十七斤，一九五○年为五百八十七斤，一九五一年为六百四十七点三二斤，一九五二年为七百五十点二四斤，一九五三年为八百一十八点四六斤，一九五四年为九百五十一点四八斤，一九五五年为一千零十七点三四斤，由缺粮县变为余粮县。就是揭阳的水稻生产，虽然受到旱、碱、虫、风、寒等五大灾害的严重侵袭，但在部分地区亦仍获得大面积丰收，出现了五个千斤区，七十五个千斤乡，一百九十三个千斤社，而东方升农业社全社五百亩双季水稻每亩平均产量达一千四百二十五点四斤。林炎城同志领导的云光社，有二亩丰产田每亩平均达二千零二十斤。今年早稻生产，在全面实现了合作化后，又进一步普遍贯彻执行兴修水利，技术改革，增施肥料三项增产措施，在百分之八十的地区解除了一般水旱灾害的威胁，集积土杂肥六亿六千万多担（每亩计可施土杂肥一百担左右），同时，在农业社中训练与组织了十三万个农业技术研究员，作为推广提高技术改革的骨干力量，在百分之九十七左右的水稻面积实行小株密植（其中单双株密植占百分之二十），因而获得丰收。全区总产量比去年增加了百分之二十三，单位面积产量提高了百分之十六。汕头市郊红光高级社的一点四五亩丰产田每亩产量达一千零四十七点四斤，土地贫瘠的潮阳南门高级社每亩平均产量达七百五十二斤，比去年增产百分之二十。
　　千千万万的事实证明了：尽管汕头地区人多地少，目前尚未实现农业机械化，粮食产量已经较高，但只要在农业合作化的基础上，具体组织农业社全面发展农业生产与副业生产，普遍贯彻各项增产措施，做到解决大量剩余劳动力的出路，发挥农村巨大的劳动潜力与土地潜力，在高产的基础上取得更高的产量，是完全可能的。那些认为“人多是包袱，高产区的潜力已经到顶”的论点是完全错误的。潮安福塘乡幸福社在这方面给我们提供了很好的榜样：该社除按原有的农、副业生产计划、劳动规划进行生产外，又组织多余劳动力到黄田山开荒（已开荒四百五十亩，并已种下木薯、花生、油麻、蕃薯、菠萝、柑橘、柠檬、桃等三百四十三亩；还造林六百五十亩），扩大社的畜牧生产，发展社的加工、运输、手工业，并且为降低农业生产成本，确定比原定计划多积三倍土杂肥（需增加二万五千一百四十个劳动日），完全解决了全社六万五千四百八十八个多余劳动日的出路；同时又在农业上进行精耕细作，全面贯彻增产措施，使上半年各种作物普遍获得增产，计：水稻三百零九亩，每亩产五百四十七斤，比去年增产百分之三十；花生一千一百二十四亩，每亩产量三百六十五斤，比去年增产百分之十三；黄麻一百五十四亩，每亩产七百十七斤，比去年增产百分之三十点三；蕃薯六百四十四亩，每亩产二千六百七十斤，比去年增产百分之三十三点五；其它农作物如芋头亦增了产。早造预分结果（单从农业收入十四万二千五百三十九元进行分配），每个劳动日值一点六元，每户平均收入一百七十一点四元，比去年初级社时每户收入一百三十三元增加三十八点四元，全社五百四十七户，社员比入社前增加收入的有五百二十四户，占社员总户数百分之九十五以上。事实说明，只要每一农业社能因地制宜地贯彻幸福社的方向，是完全可以解决劳动力的出路和进一步提高单位面积产量，保证增加社员收入的。　
  　去冬今春，我们在农业合作化大发展之后，曾一度犯了重粮食轻经济作物与副业生产的偏向；春耕结束后，经中央与广东省委的正确指示，才开始纠正这一错误。但目前全区在解决大量劳动力的出路，充分发挥劳动潜力，开展多种经营，全面贯彻农业增产措施，保证农业社能全面增产、社员增加收入上，还未完全很好解决，还存在不少缺点和错误仍有待我们今后进一步的努力。
