Xinhua News Agency, Berlin dispatch: According to "Neues Deutschland," the head of the German Communist Party delegation to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, First Secretary of the German Communist Party Max Reimann, upon returning to Germany, delivered a radio address on the Free German Radio Station 904 on the evening of September 26, stating that attending the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China left a profound and lasting impression on the members of the German Communist Party delegation. The great Chinese people, one of the oldest and most cultured nations in mankind, having endured long-term colonial oppression, have already, under the leadership of the Communist Party, shaken off the shackles of colonialism and are now building socialism.

Reimann said: After the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the victory of the Chinese people is undoubtedly the most important event in world history. Encouraged by the example of the Chinese people, the peoples of Asia and Africa are also throwing off their colonial shackles.

Reimann emphasized that after attending the Congress of the Communist Party of China, the German Communists' understanding was deepened that it is truly a German national policy for Germany to pursue a policy of striving to establish close friendships with the people of all countries, especially with the people of the East and the countries that have shaken off the shackles of colonialism.

Reimann then pointed out that the West German government's policy is short-sighted and contrary to the interests of the German people. Because the West German government implemented the conscription law and outlawed the German Communist Party, the shadow of fascism has once again covered the German land; because the West German government openly took a stand against the legitimate rights of the Egyptian people at the second London Suez Canal Conference, siding with the colonial countries, West Germany has become even more isolated internationally.

Reimann called for stopping and changing this disastrous policy of the West German government, and pointed out, "The future of our people is only guaranteed when the goal of the Federal government's policy is disarmament, understanding, and striving for the victory of the principles of peaceful coexistence."

Reimann stated that the German Communist Party will always be at the forefront in the struggle to change the current policy of the West German government.

    雷曼回到德国后发表演说
    德国必须同一切国家的人民建立亲密友谊
    德共将坚决进行争取改变西德政策的斗争
    新华社柏林电　据“新德意志报”报道：参加中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的德国共产党代表团团长、德国共产党第一书记马克斯·雷曼回到德国以后，9月26日晚间在德国第九○四号自由电台上发表广播演说说：参加中国共产党第八次全国代表大会给德国共产党代表团的团员们留下了深刻而持久的印象。伟大的中国人民是人类最古老的、有文化修养的民族之一，在经受过长期的殖民主义压迫以后，已经在共产党的领导下摆脱了殖民主义的枷锁，现在正在建设社会主义。
    雷曼说：在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利以后，中国人民的胜利无疑是世界历史上最重要的事件。在中国人民的榜样的鼓励下，亚非人民也正在抛掉他们的殖民主义枷锁。
    雷曼强调指出，在参加中国共产党代表大会以后，加深了德国共产党人的这种认识：德国必须奉行努力同一切国家的人民，特别是同东方各国的人民和已经摆脱殖民主义枷锁的各国人民建立亲密的友谊的政策，这才是真正德国民族的政策。
    雷曼接着指出，西德政府的政策是短视的和违背德国人民利益的。由于西德政府实施了征兵法，并且取缔了德国共产党，法西斯主义的阴影已经再一次地遮盖在德国土地上了；由于西德政府在第二次伦敦苏伊士运河问题会议上公然采取了反对埃及人民正当权利的立场，站到殖民国家的一边，这样就使得西德在国际上更加孤立了。
    雷曼号召制止西德政府这种灾难性的政策和改变这种政策，并且指出，“只有当联邦政府政策的目标是裁减军备和取得谅解以及争取和平共处原则的胜利的时候，我国人民的前途才有保障。”
    雷曼表示，在争取改变目前西德政府政策的斗争中，德国共产党将始终站在最前列。
