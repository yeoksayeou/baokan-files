    Breaking Promises

    Our 332 Exploration Team of the East China Geological Bureau went to southern Zhejiang in January this year to conduct exploration work. The first difficulty we encountered was that this area is mountainous, and transportation is inconvenient, making it impossible to transport heavy machinery and equipment such as generators. To this end, our team leader contacted Pingyang County and requested their assistance in finding a solution. Wu, the county magistrate of Pingyang County (member of the CCP County Committee), promised to build the road from Ao River through Shuitou to Shanmen District, but needed our support of 2,000 yuan as a fund. If we agreed, the road would be open to traffic by March 1st. At that time, we agreed, but after March 1st, the road was nowhere to be seen. Many of our team's mechanical equipment had to be disassembled into parts and hired laborers to carry them. From March 1st to the end of July, the transportation cost alone was more than 15,000 yuan, which was more than five times the cost of truck transportation. As a result, our originally planned work time was also forced to be postponed.

    Later, Pingyang County asked us to provide another 5,000 yuan to compensate farmers for giving up their land. Unexpectedly, even after paying 5,000 yuan, this road was still not built.

    Regarding this issue, the leading comrades in our team have reported to the Wenzhou Prefectural Committee and the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee. Their replies were that it would be completed soon.

    Unexpectedly, on August 15th, the Pingyang County Transportation Section gave us an official letter saying that before August 20th, we would have to give them another 10,000 yuan because several bridges and sections of the roadbed had no funds to repair. If we didn't agree, they would dismiss the workers. We really don't understand why the leaders of Pingyang County are so untrustworthy? Is it only our obligation to support Pingyang County, and Pingyang County has no obligation to support the exploration team?

    言而无信
    我们华东地质局三三二勘探队，今年1月到浙南进行勘探工作，遇到的头一个困难，就是这里是山区，交通不便，发电机等许多笨重的机械装备运不进去。为此，我们队长曾去平阳县联系，请求他们帮助设法解决。平阳县吴县长（中共县委委员）答应修建从敖江经水头到山门区这段公路，但需要我们支援二千元作为基金，如果我们同意，3月1日公路即可通车。当时，我们同意了，但过了3月1日，公路却是无声无息。我们队的许多机械设备只好拆成零件，雇民工搬运，从3月1日到7月底，搬运费就花了一万五千多元，超过汽车运价的五倍多，这样，我们原计划的工作时间也被迫推迟。
    后来平阳县又要我们拿出五千元给农民让出土地，不料出了五千元，这条路还没有修好。
    关于这个问题，我们队里的领导同志曾向温州地委、浙江省人民委员会反映过，他们的回答都是很快就能修好。
    不料8月15日，平阳县交通科给我们一个公函说，8月20日以前，要我们再给他们一万元，因为有几幢桥梁和部分段落路基，没有经费修了，如果我们不答应，他们就遣散工人。我们实在不明白，为什么平阳县领导人那样言而无信？难道只有我们有义务支援平阳县，而平阳县没有义务支援勘探队吗？
