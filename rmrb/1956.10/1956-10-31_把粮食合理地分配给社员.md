    Rationally Distributing Grain to Cooperative Members
    Chen Bowei
    How should agricultural production cooperatives distribute grain to their members? This is a major concern for every cooperative member.

    The grain distribution of agricultural cooperatives is closely related to the state's unified purchase and sale of grain. Therefore, the State Council, in its regulations regarding the unified purchase and sale of grain by agricultural production cooperatives, also made principled stipulations regarding the internal grain distribution of cooperatives. This is: after the cooperative ensures the completion of the state's grain purchase quota and the necessary grain for all members, if there is any surplus grain, the agricultural cooperative can decide to sell it to the state, or distribute it to the members according to their labor contribution. When studying grain distribution issues, cooperatives in various regions can adopt various specific methods based on specific circumstances and the opinions of the members; however, no matter which method is adopted, the distribution of grain should comply with the above principles.

    Why is it necessary to ensure the necessary grain for all members?

    Regarding this question, there was a debate during the summer harvest distribution and the formulation of the autumn harvest distribution plan this year. Those who opposed this believed that all products of the cooperative, including grain, should be distributed according to labor, with more labor receiving more, otherwise, it would be egalitarianism. This view is incomplete and incorrect.

    The distribution principle of agricultural production cooperatives (advanced cooperatives) is remuneration according to labor, with more labor receiving more. There is no doubt about this. However, first ensuring that all members can receive their basic necessary grain, while balancing this in the distribution of other income, does not contradict the principle of remuneration according to labor, and therefore should not be called egalitarianism.

    Whether the principle of remuneration according to labor is realized should be measured from the overall aspect, that is, from the distribution of all income (including in-kind and cash) of the cooperative, and not just from the distribution of a certain kind of in-kind object.

    After the basic realization of cooperativization, the state stipulated that the unified purchase and sale of grain should be carried out in rural areas with the cooperative as the unit. This is entirely necessary. If the cooperative does not uniformly balance the surplus and deficit of grain within the cooperative and ensure the necessary grain for all members, but instead distributes grain entirely according to the number of workdays done by the members, the result may be that a cooperative that originally had surplus grain becomes a "grain-deficient cooperative." Just imagine: on the one hand, there is a large surplus of grain in the cooperative, but on the other hand, the state has to supply grain to the cooperative. Can this be said to be reasonable? Furthermore, from the perspective of the cooperative itself, if grain is distributed entirely according to workdays, the amount of grain received by each member will vary greatly, with some people receiving more grain than they can eat, while others do not receive enough grain and have to constantly ask the government and cooperative cadres for grain. In such a cooperative, can the members be well united with each other and with the cadres? Can the production enthusiasm of grain-deficient members not be affected? Only by ensuring that all members receive the grain they need can it be conducive to the implementation of the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, and to the internal unity and development of production of the cooperative.

    Both ensure the necessary grain for members and ensure more grain for those who work more.

    Ensuring that all members can obtain the necessary grain is not equal to equal distribution. During the summer harvest distribution, some cooperatives, regardless of the amount of grain, adopted the practice of distributing it equally according to population, which caused dissatisfaction among members who had done more workdays. This method of equal distribution regardless of the amount of grain is not good. Under the current general circumstances, many farmers value grain more than money, and would rather have more grain and less money. This mentality is understandable. This should be taken into account when distributing grain. Therefore, surplus grain cooperatives and partially self-sufficient grain cooperatives (some cooperatives are self-sufficient according to the grain "three fix" figures, but because of increased production without increased purchases, they may actually have some surplus grain) should, under the principle of ensuring the necessary grain for all members, distribute the surplus grain to those members who have done more workdays. In this regard, various localities have put forward many specific methods in formulating the autumn harvest distribution plan. Here are several types summarized, and some opinions are put forward, hoping everyone will study them.

    The first method is: first, distribute the grain entirely according to workdays, and then take the method of adjustment, mobilizing some surplus grain members to adjust a part of their surplus grain to grain-deficient members. I think that if the number of workdays done by the members of a cooperative does not differ greatly, and a slight adjustment after the distribution of grain according to workdays can ensure that all members receive the necessary grain, then it is not impossible to adopt this method. However, if this is not the case, it is not appropriate to adopt this method. Because after distributing the grain entirely according to workdays, everyone can freely dispose of the grain they have received, and there will be many troubles in adjusting it, and the necessary grain for grain-deficient members may not be guaranteed. Even if the necessary grain for grain-deficient members is fully guaranteed, if the grain-deficient members cannot produce cash for a while, those members who have been mobilized to adjust the grain may be dissatisfied. Therefore, instead of spending a lot of effort to organize adjustments after distributing according to workdays, it is better to deduct the necessary grain for all members in advance and then distribute it.

    The second method is: first deduct the necessary grain for all members, and the remaining grain is distributed by all members according to the number of workdays. In this way, in addition to receiving a share of necessary grain, each household may also receive a part of the grain more or less. As a result, some members whose total value of workdays is less than the value of the necessary grain may relatively receive more grain, thereby relatively reducing the grain received by those members with more workdays. Therefore, some members may not be satisfied with this method.

    The third method is: the cooperative distributes all the grain that should be distributed to the members according to a certain proportion according to population and workdays (for example, 70% of the grain is distributed according to population, and 30% of the grain is distributed according to workdays). The determination of this proportion is generally based on ensuring that the grain received by the members with the least workdays is no less than their necessary grain. The disadvantage of this distribution method is: this may also cause some members to receive more grain than their total value of workdays, and make those members who have done more workdays not get more grain. However, in some cooperatives with a lot of surplus grain, if the members with more workdays are not too particular, this method or the second method can also be adopted.

    The fourth method is: first deduct the necessary grain for all members, and the remaining grain is distributed by those members whose total value of workdays exceeds the necessary grain according to the number of workdays they have done. In this way, it not only ensures that members with fewer workdays can receive the necessary grain, but also ensures that members with more workdays can receive more grain. Therefore, this method is more reasonable than the above three methods and can better encourage the labor enthusiasm of the members.

      How should the amount of necessary grain for members be determined?

    This is also a question that many members are very concerned about. There are two practices in various places: some cooperatives stipulate only one ration amount regardless of adults or children; some cooperatives stipulate ration amounts separately according to the difference in food consumption between adults and children. It is understood that in cooperatives with a lot of surplus grain, members do not care about the ration amount for adults and children; while in cooperatives with not much surplus grain, many members require that the ration amounts be stipulated separately according to "large mouths and small mouths" in order to save some grain for distribution according to workdays. Therefore, this issue should also be resolved based on the specific circumstances and the opinions of the members.

    Some members have done very few workdays for various reasons, and their total value of workdays may not be enough to offset the value of the necessary grain they should receive. These members have to pay the cooperative for the price of the grain. It is necessary for some cooperatives to take appropriate measures to take care of members who have difficulty paying cash at once. For example, appropriately arranging work assignments, consciously arranging for these members to do more workdays to increase income; advance a portion of labor day remuneration; repay a portion of personal investment in advance; etc., these are all ways to help them overcome difficulties. In addition, if some people's income cannot be exchanged for the necessary grain that the cooperative should distribute to them, the cooperative can sell the part of the grain they need to purchase gradually in the future to the state grain store as revolving grain, and they will purchase it back from the state grain store with a revolving certificate in the future. As for the "five guarantees households" and individual members with special and serious difficulties, if they are unable to pay for the necessary grain distributed to them, it can be offset by public welfare funds, relief funds, and loans. In short, this issue should be properly resolved by various means, and do not let this matter affect the unity between members.

    把粮食合理地分配给社员
    陈泊微
    农业生产合作社的粮食应当怎样分配给社员？这是每一个社员都十分关心的一件大事。
    农业社的粮食分配跟国家的粮食统购统销有着密切的关系，因此，国务院在关于农业生产合作社粮食统购统销的规定中，对于合作社内部的粮食分配，也作了原则的规定。这就是：合作社在保证完成国家粮食征购任务以及全体社员的必需用粮以后，如果还有多余的粮食，可以由农业社自己决定卖给国家，或者根据社员的劳动情况，分配给社员。各地合作社在研究粮食分配问题的时候，可以根据具体情况和社员的意见，采取多种多样的具体办法；但是，不论采取哪种办法，都应当使粮食的分配符合上面的原则。
    为什么一定要保证全体社员的必需用粮呢？
    关于这个问题，在今年夏收分配和制定秋收分配方案的过程中，是有过争论的。反对这样做的人认为：合作社的一切产品，包括粮食在内，都应当按劳分配，多劳多得，否则，就是平均主义。这种看法是不全面、不正确的。
    农业生产合作社（高级社）的分配原则是按劳取酬，多劳多得。这是没有疑问的。但是，首先保证全体社员都能分得他们所必需的基本用粮，同时在其他收入的分配上加以抽补平衡，这样的做法同按劳取酬的原则并不矛盾，因此也不应当说是平均主义。
    按劳取酬的原则是不是实现了，应当从总的方面，也就是从合作社的全部收入（包括实物和现金）的分配上，而不应当单从某一种实物的分配上去衡量。
    在合作化基本实现以后，国家规定在农村中以社为单位进行粮食统购统销，这是完全必要的。如果合作社不在社内统一平衡粮食的余缺，保证全体社员的必需用粮，而是完全按社员所做劳动日的多少来分配粮食，结果就很可能使一个本来有余粮的社变成一个“缺粮社”。试想：一方面社内有大量余粮，一方面却要国家向社内供应粮食。这能说是合理的吗？再从合作社本身来说，如果完全按劳动日来分配粮食，就会使各个社员所分得的粮食数量相差悬殊，一些人分得的粮食吃不了；另一些人分得的粮食不够吃，不得不经常向政府和社干部要求供应粮食。在这样的合作社里，社员之间、社员和干部之间能够团结得好吗？缺粮社员的生产积极性能够不受影响吗？只有保证全体社员都得到他们所必需的粮食，才能既有利于国家粮食统购统销政策的贯彻执行，又有利于合作社内部的团结和发展生产。
    既要保证社员的必需用粮，又要保证多劳动者多得粮
    保证全体社员都能得到必需的粮食，并不就是平均分配。在夏收分配的时候，有些合作社不管粮食多少，采取了完全按人口平均分配的做法，因而曾经引起多做了劳动日的社员们的不满。这种不问粮食多少，一律平均分配的办法，是不好的。在目前的一般的情况下，很多农民把粮食看得比钱重要，宁愿多要一些粮食少要一些钱。这种心理是可以理解的。在分配粮食的时候，应当照顾到这一点。因此，余粮社和部分粮食自足社（有些合作社按粮食“三定”数字计算是自足社，但由于增产不增购，实际上它可能有些余粮），应当在保证全体社员必需用粮的原则下，把多余的粮食分给那些多做了劳动日的社员。在这方面，各地在制定秋收分配方案中提出了许多具体办法，这里归纳出以下几种，并提出几点意见，希望大家研究。
    第一种办法是：首先把粮食完全按劳动日分配，然后再采取调剂的方式，动员一部分余粮社员调剂出一部分余粮给缺粮社员。我认为，如果一个社的社员所做的劳动日数量相差不太大、按劳动日分配粮食后稍加调剂就可以保证全体社员得到必需用粮的话，采取这种办法，未尝不可。但是，如果不是这种情况，采取这个办法是不大妥当的。因为完全按劳动日分配粮食以后，每个人可以自由处理自己分到的粮食，调剂起来就有很多麻烦，缺粮社员所必需的粮食不一定确有保证。即使完全保证了缺粮社员必需的粮食，如果缺粮社员一时拿不出现钱，那些被动员调剂出粮食的社员又可能不满意。因此，与其按劳动日分配以后再花费很大力气去组织调剂，还不如预先扣出全体社员的必需粮食然后再分配。
    第二种办法是：先扣出全体社员的必需用粮，剩下的粮食由全体社员按劳动日的多少进行分配。这样，每户社员除了分得一份必需用粮以外，还可能或多或少地分得一部分粮食。结果，一部分所做劳动日总值少于必需用粮价值的社员，就可能相对地多分得一部分粮食，从而相对地减少了那些劳动日较多的社员分得的粮食。因此，有些社员对这种办法可能不满意。
    第三种办法是：合作社把应该分配给社员的粮食，全部以一定的比例按照人口和劳动日分配给社员（例如把70％的粮食按人口分配，30％的粮食按劳动日分配）。这种比例的确定，一般以保证劳动日最少的社员分得的粮食不少于他的必需用粮为准。这样的分配办法的缺点是：这也可能使一部分社员得到的粮食超过他的劳动日总值，而使那些多做了劳动日的社员得不到更多的粮食。不过，在有些余粮很多的合作社里，如果劳动日多的社员不斤斤计较的话，这个办法或第二种办法也是可以采用的。
    第四种办法是：先扣出全体社员的必需用粮，剩下的粮食由劳动日总值超过必需用粮的那部分社员按所做劳动日的多少进行分配。这样，既保证了劳动日少的社员可以分得必需用粮，又保证了劳动日多的社员可以分得更多的粮食。所以，这个办法比起上面三种办法更合理些，更能鼓励社员的劳动积极性。
      社员的必需用粮数量应当怎样确定？
    这也是许多社员很关心的问题。各地有两种做法：有的社不论大人小孩只规定一个口粮数量；有的社根据大人小孩的食量的差别分别规定口粮数量。据了解，在余粮很多的合作社中，社员们并不计较大人小孩的口粮数量；而在余粮不多的合作社中，许多社员都要求按“大口小口”来分别规定口粮数量，以便剩下一部分粮食好按劳动日分配。因此，这个问题也应当根据具体情况和社员群众的意见去解决。
    有些社员由于种种原因做的劳动日很少，他们的劳动日总值可能不够抵偿自己应得的必需用粮的价值。这些社员就得向社补交粮食价款。有些合作社对于一时交现款有困难的社员，采取适当的办法加以照顾，这是必要的。比如在出工上适当地安排，有意识地使这部分社员多做些劳动日以增加收入；预支一部分劳动日报酬；提前偿还一部分个人投资；等等，这些都是帮助他们克服困难的办法。另外，如果有些人的收入不能换取合作社应该分给他们的必需用粮的话，也可以把他们需要今后陆续购买的一部分粮食由合作社把这部分粮食当做周转粮卖给国家粮店，将来由他们凭周转证向国家粮店购回。至于“五保户”和有特殊严重困难的个别社员，分给他们的必需用粮，他们无力付款的，可以用公益金、救济款和贷款来抵补。总之，这个问题应当采取各种办法妥善解决，不要因为这件事影响社员之间的团结。
