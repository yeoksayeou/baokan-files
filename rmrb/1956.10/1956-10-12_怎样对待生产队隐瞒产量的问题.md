How to Treat the Problem of Production Teams Concealing Output
Guo Xun

In many agricultural production cooperatives, some production teams have been collectively concealing their output.

According to preliminary statistics from the CCP Puqi County Committee in Hubei Province, 50% of agricultural cooperatives in the county experienced production teams concealing their output during the summer harvest distribution. In the Liujing District of Beiliu County, Guangxi, each of the 240 agricultural cooperative production teams concealed approximately 1,000 jin of rice. Huang Chunyuan (a Communist Party member), the management committee member and fifth production team leader of the Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative in Aimiao Township, Yingcheng County, Hubei, along with Huang Bailin, the branch secretary of the cooperative's Communist Youth League, secretly convened a "Zhuge Liang meeting" to plan specific methods for collectively concealing production, and convened two meetings of all team members to formulate three "rules for concealing production," ultimately concealing more than 1,200 jin of wheat and barley.

There are many reasons why production teams conceal their output. In some cooperatives, teams distrust each other, all fearing that other teams will receive larger shares and their own teams will receive less. Some teams have better crop yields than others and fear that they will not receive over-production bonuses and will suffer losses. Some teams fear that the cooperative will withhold too much, so they take a "preemptive strike." … Regardless of the reason, it all comes down to fearing that their own team will suffer losses in the distribution. Chen Maobin, a member of a production team in the Hejialong Agricultural Cooperative in Liling County, Hunan, publicly stated at a meeting of the team's member representatives, under the direction of team leader Chen Shunyan: "If we don't seize the opportunity to grab something now, it will be too late to avoid losses later!"

It should be said that these people are mistaken. Production teams concealing output is certainly not beneficial to agricultural cooperatives. But how much benefit does it bring to the production teams themselves? If your team conceals output, and other teams also conceal output, and every team conceals output, wouldn't the end result be the same? The only result of this is to add unnecessary trouble to the cooperative's distribution work, and also cause disunity between teams and between members, affecting the production and consolidation of the cooperative. Wouldn't the result be that everyone suffers?

Some production teams, due to the efforts of their members, have actual yields that exceed the original contracted yields or the yields of other teams, and they feel that if they don't conceal some output, their team will suffer losses in the distribution. If this is indeed the case, the cooperative should seriously consider revising the contracted output plan appropriately. If there are no contracted yields yet, a certain reward system should be established.

Some production teams conceal output because the land in their villages is inherently better, and they feel that they are suffering too much by forming a large cooperative with villages with poorer land. In such cases, consideration should be given to providing appropriate care to the production teams with originally better land.

Some production teams conceal output, of course, is inseparable from the lack of collectivist thought among the cadres and members of these teams; however, it is not enough to just blame them. They have not been rid of private ownership for long, and the thinking of petty private owners cannot be completely eliminated at once. The problem is that some rural workers have not helped rural cadres to go deep into the grassroots organizations of agricultural cooperatives, and, based on the specific ideological situation of the production team cadres and members, regularly, systematically, and deeply conduct collectivist education, and publicize and explain to them the various provisions related to distribution in the "Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative Model Charter," and promptly solve various problems in labor management and distribution. Some counties summarily describe this phenomenon as "corruption," and even launch "anti-corruption campaigns" in an attempt to solve the problem with "pressure," which will not have good results.

    怎样对待生产队隐瞒产量的问题
    国勋
    在不少农业生产合作社里发生了一些生产队集体隐瞒产量的问题。
    据中共湖北省蒲圻县委会的初步统计，在夏收分配中，全县有50％的农业社发生了生产队隐瞒产量的事情。广西北流县六靖区各农业社的二百四十个生产队，每队都隐瞒稻谷千斤左右。湖北应城县艾庙乡金星农业社管理委员兼第五生产队长黄春元（共产党员）和社青年团分支书记黄白林，秘密召开“诸葛亮会议”，筹划集体瞒产的具体作法，并两次召集全队社员开会，制定了三条“瞒产纪律”，共隐瞒大麦小麦一千二百多斤。
    生产队隐瞒产量的原因很多。在有些社里，队与队之间互相猜疑，都怕别的队分的多了，本队分的少了。有些队的作物比别的队长得好，怕得不到超产奖励吃了亏。有的队怕社里多扣留，就来个“先下手为强”。……不管为这也好，为那也好，都是怕自己的队在分配中吃了亏。湖南醴陵县何家垅农业社某生产队队员陈茂彬在队长陈顺炎指使下，公开在这个队的社员代表会上说：“再不下手捞一把，以后吃亏就来不及了！”
    应该说，这些人的算盘是打错了。生产队隐瞒产量，对农业社来说，固然没有什么好处。但对生产队来说，究竟有多大好处呢？你这个队瞒产，他那个队也瞒产，队队都瞒产，到头来还不是一样？这样作的结果，只不过给社的分配工作添许多不必要的麻烦，也引起了队与队、社员与社员之间的不团结，影响了合作社的生产和巩固。其结果，还不是大家都得吃亏？
    有的生产队由于社员们的努力，实产量超过了原包产量或别的队的产量，他们觉得不隐瞒一点，本队在分配中就要吃亏。如果确是如此，社里就应该认真考虑，适当地修订包产的产量计划。还没有包产的，也该制定一定的奖励制度。
    有些生产队隐瞒产量，是因为他们村子的土地本来就比较好，同土地不好的村子一起成立了大社，他们觉得太吃亏。在这样的情况下，应该考虑用适当的办法给原来土地较好的生产队以适当的照顾。
    一些生产队隐瞒产量，当然是和这些队的干部和社员缺乏集体主义思想分不开的；但是，不可只是去责备他们。他们丢掉私有制并没有多久，小私有者的思想是不可能一下子消除净尽的。问题在于：一些农村工作人员没有帮助农村干部，深入农业社的基层组织，根据生产队干部和社员们的具体思想情况，经常、系统、深入地进行集体主义教育，并向他们宣传解释“高级农业生产合作社示范章程”中有关分配问题的各项规定，及时解决劳动管理和分配中的各种问题。有的县把这种现象一概说成是“贪污”，甚至开展“反贪污运动”，企图用“压力”解决这个问题，那是不会有好结果的。
