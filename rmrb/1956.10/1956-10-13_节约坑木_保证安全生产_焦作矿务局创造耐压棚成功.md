    Saving Pit Props and Ensuring Safe Production
    Jiaozuo Mining Bureau Successfully Creates Pressure-Resistant Props
    (Our report) A pressure-resistant prop, which can greatly save wood and labor consumption, reduce spalling and roof collapse accidents, and is convenient to manufacture and use, and suitable for widespread promotion in various coal mines, has been successfully created by the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau after more than a year of testing, and the effect is very good.
    This pressure-resistant prop is made by modifying the structure of the original wooden prop. The cost is only one-tenth more than that of a wooden prop. Its structure is such that under the beam of a general wooden prop, two specially made round steel tie rods are inserted diagonally from both ends. One end of the tie rod is fixed to the head of the wooden beam with a screw cap and a metal washer, and the other end is connected and tightened with a tightening device. Two square timbers are placed between the beam and the tie rods at the points dividing the beam into thirds. This transforms the beam of the wooden prop from a simple beam into an inverted truss hybrid prop suitable for the conditions of mine roadways, which can not only economically use a small amount of steel and scrap steel ropes, but also increase the strength of the prop by more than three times, and can also transform small-diameter pit props that could not be used before into pressure-resistant props with the same strength as large-diameter pit props.
    Coal miners work hundreds of meters underground. At such depths, the pressure of the strata is very high, and wooden props that bear the pressure need to be repaired and replaced several times a year, which wastes wood and labor, and affects underground transportation, ventilation, and safety. Therefore, in the current situation of insufficient wood supply and serious work-related accidents, promoting this pressure-resistant prop is of particular significance. At the same time, the use of this pressure-resistant prop, unlike the use of cement props, is not restricted by cement supply, manufacturing conditions, and the conditions of the area of use, so it is very suitable for the objective conditions of various coal mines and is easy to promote.
    This pressure-resistant prop was designed by engineer Ruan Mengwu of the Beijing Coal Science Research Institute. After testing, it has been fully proven to have a high pressure resistance capacity. For example, in a place with very high pressure, forty pressure-resistant props were erected. After a year and a half, the adjacent wooden props had been broken and replaced more than twice, while the pressure-resistant props remained intact.
    Now, this pressure-resistant prop has developed from key trials to comprehensive promotion in the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, and the number used underground has reached 2,500.

### 节约坑木　保证安全生产  焦作矿务局创造耐压棚成功

    节约坑木　保证安全生产
    焦作矿务局创造耐压棚成功
    本报讯　一种可以大大节约木材和人工消耗、减少片帮冒顶事故、制造和使用又很方便、适宜各煤矿普遍推广的耐压棚，经过一年多的试验，目前已在焦作矿务局创造成功，效果很好。
    这种耐压棚是在原有木棚的基础上改造结构型式而制成的，成本只比木棚增加了十分之一。它的结构是，在一般木棚棚梁的下面，从两端斜穿入两根特制的园钢拉杆，拉杆的一端由螺丝帽及金属垫板固定在木梁头上，另一端用一松紧装置将两杆加以连接并拉紧；在梁的三等分点，与拉杆之间垫以二块方木。这样就使木棚的棚梁，从简单梁改造成为适合于矿井巷道条件的倒桁式混合棚子，既能极经济地使用少量钢材及废钢绳，又能使棚子的强度增加三倍以上，还能把原来不能利用的小直径坑木改造成与大直径坑木有同样强度的耐压棚。
    煤矿工人是在几百公尺深的地下工作的。在这样深的地下，地层的压力很大，承受压力的木棚一年要修换几次，既浪费木材和人工，又影响井下的运输通风和安全。因此，在当前木材供应不足、工伤事故严重的情况下，推广这种耐压棚有特别重大的意义。同时，使用这种耐压棚不像使用水泥棚那样，受水泥供应、制造条件和使用地区条件的限制，所以很适合各煤矿的客观情况，容易推广。
    这种耐压棚是北京煤炭科学研究院工程师阮孟武设计的。经过试验，充分证明它有很高的耐压能力。例如在一处压力很大的地方，支架了耐压棚四十架，经过一年半的时间，邻近的木棚均已被压断修换了两次以上，而耐压棚仍然全部完好无损。
    现在，这种耐压棚在焦作矿务局已由重点试验发展到全面推广，井下使用的数量已达二千五百架。
