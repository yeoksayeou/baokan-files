Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, October 14th: The Benxi Iron and Steel Plant has increased its production by more than 2,500 tons of high-quality pig iron by the beginning of October this year.

　　The plant's two old blast furnaces were built in 1915 and 1917. The furnace body, hearth, bosh, etc. of these two blast furnaces have been renovated, and necessary equipment has been added to replace heavy manual labor. In the past, the clinker put into the blast furnace was pushed by workers in carts from a distance of 300 to 400 meters to the side of the blast furnace. Now, electric trams are used for transportation. Ironworkers used to have to face splashing sparks to plug the taphole, but now they use automatic mud guns to plug the taphole.

　　Since the beginning of this year, the plant has also promoted many advanced experiences such as self-fluxing sintered ore, increasing wind temperature, and furnace top regulation.

    本溪炼铁厂经过改造
    增产两千多吨优质生铁
    新华社本溪14日电　本溪炼铁厂今年到10月初止已经增产了两千五百多吨优质生铁。
    这个厂的两座旧高炉，是在1915年和1917年建成的。这两座高炉的炉身、炉缸、炉腹等都已经经过改造，并且增添了必要的设备来代替繁重的体力劳动。过去投入高炉的熟料是由工人从三、四百公尺远的地方，一车一车推到高炉旁，现在已经改用电车运输了。炼铁工人们原来要迎着飞溅的火花去堵铁口，现在是用自动泥炮机堵铁口。
    今年以来，这个厂还推广了烧结矿自熔性、提高风温、炉顶调剂等许多先进经验。
