According to the Sichuan Daily, the question of how to properly manage the current production coordination during the merging and transformation of cooperatives to ensure that both the original cooperatives' increased planting of late autumn crops and the large cooperatives' early spring production are not neglected is a prominent issue in Sichuan Province's rural areas. Recently, the Rural Work Department of the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee held a symposium of resident cooperative cadres to study ways to solve this problem.

In Sichuan Province, cooperatives are currently being merged and transformed. In some areas, due to insufficient publicity and education work, coupled with the failure to resolve certain specific issues, many members and cadres of the original cooperatives are only focused on grasping the autumn harvest and increasing the planting of late autumn crops for this year's distribution, while neglecting autumn plowing and water storage work, resulting in serious disconnects in production. After fully studying this situation, the meeting participants believed that the production and distribution of late autumn crops should be managed by the original cooperatives and participate in the annual distribution; however, in order to more closely coordinate the large cooperatives' early spring production and the original cooperatives' late autumn crop production, the overall plan and arrangement of late autumn crop production should be made by the management committee of the large cooperative, and the original cooperatives should plant according to the large cooperative's plan and arrangement to avoid blindly expanding late autumn crops and affecting early spring production.

Regarding the contradiction in labor allocation and use due to the overlapping of agricultural work for the original cooperatives' increased planting of late autumn crops and the large cooperatives' early spring production, everyone believed that this issue should be addressed through unified planning and arrangement by the large cooperative. Before the production organization is changed, it should still be assigned to the original cooperative's production team for implementation to avoid the phenomenon of no one being responsible or waiting and watching during the transition period. As for the work points earned by the members, they should be recorded under the names of each household member and calculated during the annual distribution and settlement of the original cooperative. The calculation principle should be based on the spirit of ensuring that neither the large nor small cooperatives suffer losses and that the members are satisfied.

The meeting also studied some reasonable solutions to other problems in production coordination: the remuneration of the personnel who raise and till cattle for planting late autumn crops shall be borne by the original cooperatives; the remuneration of the personnel who raise and till cattle for plowing paddy fields and planting early spring crops shall be borne by the large cooperatives; the labor remuneration for the fertilizer accumulated by the original cooperatives for early spring production and next year's major spring production shall be paid by the large cooperatives in labor days or cash according to the quantity and quality of the fertilizer; the seeds, cattle fodder, cash, etc. required for the large cooperative's next year's production shall be deducted from the distribution to each household member during the original cooperative's distribution this year according to the needs of next year's production and in proportion to land shares or labor force, and transferred to the large cooperative as a production cost equity fund.

### 中共四川省委农村工作部召开座谈会  研究并社转社中的生产衔接问题

    中共四川省委农村工作部召开座谈会
    研究并社转社中的生产衔接问题
    本报讯　据四川日报报道：如何搞好当前并社、转社中的生产衔接，使原社增种晚秋作物和大社的小春生产两不误，是目前四川省农村中一个突出的问题。最近中共四川省委农村工作部召开驻社干部座谈会研究了解决这个问题的办法。
    四川省各地正在进行并社、转社，有的地区由于宣传教育工作做得不够，加之有些具体问题没有解决，因而很多原有社的社员和干部只顾抓今年能参加分配的秋收和增种晚秋作物，放松秋耕、蓄水等工作，以致生产中出现了严重的脱节现象。会上充分研究了这一情况后，认为晚秋作物的生产和分配，应该归原社经营并参加当年分配；但为了使大社的小春生产和原社的晚秋作物生产衔接得更密，对晚秋作物生产的安排，应由大社管理委员会作出统一的计划和安排，原社按大社的计划和安排进行种植，以避免因盲目扩大晚秋作物，影响小春生产。
    原社增种晚秋作物和大社小春生产的农活交错，劳动力调配使用上存在的矛盾，大家认为对这一问题应由大社统一计划，统一安排，在生产组织未变动以前，仍然分配给原社生产队执行，以避免发生过渡时期无人负责、观望等待的现象。至于社员所做的工分，记在各户社员名下，在原社年度分配决算时计算，计算的原则应本着大社、小社都不吃亏、社员满意的精神进行。
    会上对生产衔接中另外一些问题，也研究了一些合理的解决办法：种晚秋作物的饲养耕牛人员的报酬由原社负担；犁坂田、种小春作物的饲养耕牛人员的报酬由大社负担；原社为小春生产和明年大春生产所积肥料的劳动报酬，由大社按照肥料数量和质量付给劳动日或价款；大社下年度生产所需的种子、牛草、现金等，根据下年生产需要，按照土地股或劳动力，在今年原社分配时，在各户社员分配数中扣除，作为生产费股份基金，转归大社。
