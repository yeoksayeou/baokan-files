　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 9th: According to TASS, the United Nations Security Council reconvened on October 8th to discuss the Suez issue. Egyptian representative, Foreign Minister Fawzi, was the first to speak at the morning session. In his speech, he condemned the conspiracy of Western countries to undermine Egyptian sovereignty and expressed his opposition to the Anglo-French proposal. He suggested establishing a negotiation committee to peacefully resolve the Suez issue.
　　Regarding the Anglo-French proposal, Fawzi said, "It would be unwise to reintroduce proposals that have already been rejected." He said that Egypt opposed the proposal and would vote against it if Egypt were a member of the Security Council.
　　Fawzi said that the only way to achieve a peaceful settlement was to establish a committee to negotiate the Suez issue on a fully broad basis. This committee should be guided by principles acceptable to all countries, including the principle of freedom of navigation through the canal.
　　The Egyptian representative said that among all the principles guiding the work of the negotiating committee, the principle of guaranteeing freedom of navigation through the canal at any time for any vessel was the most fundamental.
　　Fawzi pointed out that the objectives of the proposed negotiating committee should include: 1. Establishing a system of cooperation between the Egyptian authorities managing the Suez Canal and the countries using the canal, taking full account of Egypt's sovereignty and rights, as well as the interests of the canal's users. 2. Establishing a fair system of tolls and other fees for canal users. 3. Ensuring that a reasonable portion of the tax revenue is specifically allocated for the improvement of the canal.
　　Before making the proposal, Fawzi recounted the various actions taken by Western countries (including refusing to pay tolls for ships passing through the canal, recalling British and French pilots, etc.) to undermine the normal management and use of the canal, and the intimidation tactics used to try to seize the canal from Egypt.
　　The Egyptian representative reminded the Council that the Suez Canal Company had been an Egyptian enterprise subject to Egyptian law. Egypt had full sovereignty to nationalize that company.
　　The Foreign Minister pointed out that the Egyptian government had never refused to participate in genuine negotiations aimed at finding a peaceful and just solution to the current dispute. He said that what Egypt opposed was not negotiation but attempts to dictate.
　　Fawzi recounted that before and during the London Suez Conference, France and Britain threatened to use force against Egypt. Furthermore, Egypt was not consulted regarding the time, location, and membership of the London Conference. Before the conference even began, the organizers put forward a plan to establish an international Suez Canal authority, which made the situation even more difficult.
　　Fawzi said that in light of these events, the "invitation" to Egypt was not an invitation but an ultimatum, an insult. This was not a conference but a tribunal. Even now, while this issue is being discussed in the Security Council, "we are repeatedly reminded not to forget that the possibility of direct use of force by Britain and France still exists."
　　Fawzi refuted the claim by the British and French representatives that the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company endangered international peace and security. He questioned, "Where is this danger to peace and security?" "Does it lie in Egypt being slandered, condemned, threatened, and subjected to military and economic measures? Perhaps this danger arises because the Egyptian government is willing to fully and fairly compensate the former shareholders of the Suez Canal Company? Perhaps this danger arises from our numerous proposals, which are still valid, to hold negotiations to find a peaceful solution? Perhaps this danger is due to the unimpeded navigation of the canal under Egyptian management?"
　　Fawzi also condemned the attacks by certain members of the British and French governments on the Egyptian head of state as "bearing all the hallmarks of a malicious interference in Egypt's internal affairs."

    在安理会讨论苏伊士问题的会议上
　　埃及外长建议设立谈判委员会
    反对英法提案谴责西方破坏埃及主权阴谋
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国安全理事会讨论苏伊士问题的会议10月8日复会。埃及代表、外交部长法齐在上午会议上第一个发言。他在发言中谴责西方国家破坏埃及主权的阴谋，并且表示反对英法提案。他建议设立一个谈判委员会来和平解决苏伊士问题。
    法齐在谈到英法提案时说：“重新提出已经遭到拒绝的建议，那将是不明智的。”他说，埃及反对这个提案，如果埃及是安全理事会理事的话，它将投票反对。
    法齐说，和平解决的唯一方法是在充分广泛的基础上，建立一个谈判苏伊士问题的委员会。这个委员会应当以一切国家接受的原则——包括运河通航自由的原则在内——为指针。
    埃及代表说，在指导谈判委员会工作的一切原则中，保证任何船只在任何时候在运河中通航自由的原则是最基本的原则。
    法齐指出，建议中的谈判委员会的目的应当包括：一、在充分考虑到埃及的主权和权利以及运河使用国的利益的情况下，建立管理苏伊士运河的埃及机构同运河使用国之间合作的制度。二、建立对运河使用国公平的缴纳通行费和其他费用的制度。三、保证拨出税款中合理的一部分专门供改善运河之用。
    在提出建议之前，法齐叙述了西方国家用各种行动（包括拒绝支付船只通过运河的通行费、召回英国和法国的引水员等等）来破坏运河的正常管理和使用恐吓手段企图把运河从埃及手中夺过去的经过情况。
    这位埃及代表提醒理事会说，苏伊士运河公司曾经是一个受埃及法律约束的埃及的企业。埃及有充分主权把那个公司收归国有。
    这位外交部长指出，埃及政府从来没有拒绝参加目的在于寻找和平而又公正地解决目前争端的办法的真正谈判。他说，埃及所反对的不是谈判而是发号施令的企图。
    法齐追述说，在伦敦苏伊士会议召开之前和会议进程中，法国和英国威胁要对埃及使用武力。此外，关于伦敦会议的时间、地点和会议成员，也没有和埃及商量过。会议还没有开始，会议的组织者就提出了建立一个苏伊士运河国际机构的方案，这就使得局势更加困难。
    法齐说，从这些事态来看，对埃及的“邀请”不是一个邀请而是一个最后通牒、一个侮辱。这不是一个会议而是一个法庭。即使在现在这个问题在安全理事会讨论的时候，“人家也一再吩咐我们，叫我们别忘记：英国和法国直接使用武力的可能性还存在。”
    法齐驳斥了英国和法国代表的这种说法：把苏伊士运河公司收归国有危害了国际和平和安全。他质问道：“这种对和平和安全的危险在哪里呢？”“难道在于埃及被污蔑、被谴责、被威胁以及对埃及采取了军事和经济的手段？也许这个危险的产生是由于埃及政府愿意完全而又公道地赔偿前苏伊士运河公司的股东？也许这个危险的产生是由于我们无数次提出至今仍然有效的关于举行谈判来找到一个和平解决的建议吧？也许这个危险是由于这条运河的通航在埃及管理下畅通无阻吧？”
    法齐还谴责英法两国政府的某些成员对埃及国家元首的攻击“有着居心叵测地干涉埃及内政的一切标志”。
