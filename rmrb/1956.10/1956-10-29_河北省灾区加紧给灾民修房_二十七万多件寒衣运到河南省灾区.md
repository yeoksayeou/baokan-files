Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 26th: In Hebei Province disaster areas, more than 577,000 rooms have been repaired. At present, party and government leading organs in various disaster areas are continuing to help disaster victims build urgently needed housing and livestock sheds to ensure that disaster victims can get through the winter.

In September, the work of repairing houses was once relaxed in various places. After the provincial leading organs corrected the slow progress of house repairs, the progress of house repairs was greatly accelerated. Since October, party and government leading comrades in various places have gone deep into the affected villages to guide the work of repairing houses, and the relevant economic departments have also vigorously supplied materials. In Handan Prefecture, which was more severely affected by the disaster, more than 244,000 rooms for winter housing had been repaired by October 8.

It is estimated that the housing problems of the vast majority of disaster victims in Hebei Province will be completely resolved by the end of October.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 26th: More than 278,000 pieces of winter clothing have recently been shipped to the areas in Henan Province that suffered from floods.

Most of these winter clothes were donated by government officials, military personnel, and people from all walks of life in Henan Province, including 102,146 pieces of winter clothing donated by officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuhan, Guangzhou, Lanzhou, and other regions.

At present, most of these winter clothes have been distributed to the disaster victims.

The person in charge of the Henan Provincial Production and Disaster Relief Committee Office told Xinhua News Agency reporters: Hubei Province has donated more than 200,000 pieces of winter clothing to support the disaster victims in Henan Province, and all of them will be shipped to the disaster-stricken counties in Henan Province by the end of October.

    河北省灾区加紧给灾民修房
    二十七万多件寒衣运到河南省灾区
    据新华社保定26日电　河北省灾区房屋已修复五十七万七千多间。目前，各灾区党和政府领导机关正继续帮助灾民把急需的住房和牲口圈棚修建起来，保证灾民过冬。
    9月间，各地对修房工作曾一度放松，经省级领导机关纠正修房迟缓现象后，修房进度大大加快。10月以来，各地党和政府领导同志深入受灾村庄指导修房工作，各有关经济部门也大力供应物料。在受灾较严重的邯郸专区至10月8日，已修好过冬住房二十四万四千多间。
    据估计，河北全省绝大多数灾民住房问题在10月底将全部解决。
    据新华社郑州26日电　二十七万八千多件寒衣，最近运到了河南省遭受水灾的地区。
    这些寒衣大部分是由河南省的机关干部、驻军和各界人士捐助的，其中包括有中国人民解放军驻武汉、广州、兰州等地区部队官兵捐助的寒衣十万二千一百四十六件。
    目前，这些寒衣大部分都已经发到了灾民手里。
    河南省生产救灾委员会办公室的负责人对新华社记者说：湖北省各地为支援河南省灾民过冬，捐助的寒衣有二十多万件，在10月底就可以全部运到河南省各受灾县份。
