Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou: The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a provincial rural work conference in September, analyzed the new situation and new problems after the basic agricultural cooperativization throughout the province, and unified the policies, strategies, and thoughts for developing rural production.

After summarizing the work achievements of the past year, the conference also examined the shortcomings and errors in rural work over the past year, believing that there were many lessons in this regard. The main reasons were the lack of experience, lack of investigation and research, and the subjective and one-sided nature of the leadership's thinking after the change in production relations. As a result, many problems arose in the leadership's production policies, plans, and technical measures. In terms of guiding production policies, it was right to focus on grain production (mainly rice) in the past few years, but the leadership neglected diversified production. The losses caused by these shortcomings and errors revealed by the conference were quite serious. Although grain production in the province has been increasing year by year, rural sideline occupations, animal husbandry, and some economic crops have been declining year by year for the past few years. According to a survey of forty-four counties, the total output value of agricultural and sideline production in eight counties decreased last year compared with 1954. The main reason for the decline was the neglect of diverse production and management other than grain.

Regarding the formulation of production plans, the conference examined that in the past, leading organs at all levels only reflected the needs of national economic construction for major agricultural products, without reflecting the characteristics of the local economy and the requirements for increasing the income of cooperative members. This resulted in copying plans at each level, squeezing out some productions that were not included in the plan. For example, the output value of Mao bamboo in this province accounts for 57% of the forestry output value, but it has been neglected for a long time because it was not included in the plan. Secondly, the plans were blind and divorced from reality; after some plans were issued, quotas were added at each level, the targets were too high, resulting in coercion. The conference also examined that there had been left-leaning and right-leaning deviations in agricultural production technical measures. Sometimes they were stubbornly unchangeable, and after criticizing right-leaning conservative thoughts, there was an eagerness for quick success, causing production losses and adverse political effects.

After examining the serious lessons brought about by the above-mentioned shortcomings and errors, the conference immediately put forward opinions on how to develop the province's local production in the future, in accordance with the spirit of the instructions issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on strengthening the production leadership and organizational construction of agricultural production cooperatives.

When studying how to determine the guiding principles for production, the conference believed that the general principle should be based on the needs of the country and the requirements of increasing the accumulation of agricultural cooperatives and increasing the income of cooperative members, and these three should be considered in a unified manner. After research and discussion, the conference believed that the policy to be implemented for the development of agricultural production in Zhejiang Province in the future should be: focusing on grain production, implementing the principle of combining agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, in order to strive for a comprehensive increase in production and ensure that more than 90% of cooperative members increase their income. The conference believed that each county and cooperative should emphasize the role of independent thinking when determining their management policies, and determine the policy for developing local production based on national requirements and local conditions.

The conference studied the possible contradictions in formulating production policies. The first contradiction is the distance between national needs and local realities. In this case, should the formulation of policies and the formulation of plans be based on national needs or local realities? Who should obey whom when there is a conflict? The conference believed that first of all, it should be recognized that the two are consistent, but there should be primary and secondary considerations on specific issues, weighing the pros and cons to determine the primary and secondary; secondly, on the basis of completing national requirements, the lower levels should be allowed flexibility; thirdly, if the above requirements are divorced from reality and cannot be realized by the lower levels, they should be reported to the higher levels for approval and balanced modification. The general spirit is to prevent both the tendency of plans being too rigid and not allowing lower levels to make corrections; and to prevent the tendency of not having plans and unilaterally emphasizing starting from local realities. The second contradiction is the contradiction between developing diversified economies and grain production. The conference believed that economic crops that have been squeezed out by grain in the past should be restored if necessary, and the three fixed quotas should be reduced accordingly; if grain needs to be supplied, it should still be supplied; if the newly developed economic crops squeeze out grain, it must be approved by the higher authorities.

For the collective management production of cooperatives and the household sideline occupations of cooperative members, the conference required that they must be arranged reasonably, each in its proper place, to increase the income of cooperative members in many ways.

The conference believed that after implementing the policy of comprehensively developing agricultural production and developing diversified management, the issue of prices of agricultural and sideline products should be addressed with an active but prudent approach, studying and solving them according to different situations.

    根据农业基本合作化后的新形势新问题
    浙江确定发展农村生产的方针
    以粮食生产为主，同时发展林、牧、副业和渔业
    据新华社杭州电　中共浙江省委在9月间召开全省农村工作会议，分析了全省农业基本合作化以后的新形势、新问题，统一了发展农村生产的方针、政策和思想。
    会议在总结了一年来的工作成绩之后，又检查了一年来农村工作的缺点和错误，认为这方面的教训是不少的，主要是在生产关系改变以后，领导缺乏经验，缺乏调查研究，以及领导思想上的主观主义、片面性，因而在领导生产的方针上、计划上及技术措施上发生了很多问题。在领导生产方针上，过去几年抓住粮食生产（主要是水稻）是对的，但忽视了多样生产的领导。会议揭发的这些缺点与错误带来的损失是相当严重的。全省粮食虽然逐年增加，但几年来农村副业、畜牧业及部分经济作物是在逐年下降。据四十四个县的调查统计，去年就有八个县的农副业生产总值比1954年下降，下降的主要原因是忽视了对粮食以外的多种多样的生产经营。
    在制定生产计划的问题上，会议检查了各级领导机关过去只反映国家经济建设对主要农产品的需要，而没有反映地方经济的特点和增加社员收入的要求，形成层层照抄照搬，使有些未列入计划的生产被挤掉了。如本省毛竹产值占林业产值57％，因未列入计划而被长期忽视。其次是计划上的盲目性，脱离实际；某些计划下达后，层层加码，指标过高，造成强迫命令。会议同时检查了在农业生产技术措施上曾产生过忽左忽右的偏向，有时固执不变，等到批判了右倾保守思想之后，又产生急功求快的急躁情绪，造成了生产上的损失和政治上的不良影响。
    会议检查了上述缺点和错误带来的严重教训后，当即根据中共中央、国务院所公布的关于加强农业生产合作社的生产领导和组织建设的指示的精神，对今后发展本省本地的生产提出了意见。
    在研究如何确定指导生产的方针时，会议认为总的原则应根据国家的需要和从农业社增加积累、社员增加收入的要求出发，要把这三者统一加以考虑。会议经过研究和讨论，认为今后浙江省发展农业生产应该贯彻执行的方针是：以粮食生产为重点，实行农业、林业、畜牧业、副业和渔业各项生产相结合的方针，以争取全面地增加生产，保证90％以上社员增加收入。会议认为各县各社在确定经营方针时，应强调发挥独立思考作用，根据国家要求和当地情况确定本地发展生产的方针。
    会议研究了在制定生产方针时可能产生的矛盾。第一种矛盾是国家需要与地方实际之间的距离。在这种情况下，确定方针和制定计划时应以国家需要为主，还以当地实际情况为主？发生矛盾时谁服从谁？会议认为首先应当认识这两者是一致的，但在具体问题上应有主次，权衡利弊，确定主次；其次是，在完成国家要求的基础上，允许下面机动；再次是，凡上面要求有脱离实际的情况，下面无法实现的，应报上级批准，平衡修改。总的精神是，既要防止计划过死，不准下面修正的倾向；又要防止不要计划，片面强调从当地实际情况出发的自流倾向。第二种矛盾是关于发展多种经济和粮食生产的矛盾。会议认为，凡是过去被粮食挤掉的经济作物，需要恢复的即应恢复起来，并相应减少三定任务；需要供应粮食的，还应供应粮食；如果新发展的经济作物，要把粮食挤掉的，必须经上级批准。
    对于合作社集体经营的生产和社员经营的家庭副业，会议要求必须合理安排，各得其所，从多方面增加社员收入。
    会议认为，在贯彻执行全面发展农业生产的方针和开展多种经营后，有关农副产品的价格问题，应该采取积极而又慎重的方针，分别不同情况，加以研究解决。
