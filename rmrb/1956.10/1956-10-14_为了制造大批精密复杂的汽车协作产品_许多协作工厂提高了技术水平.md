Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, October 12th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Ren Bingru): With the establishment of the First Automobile Works, a number of factories producing cooperative products for the First Automobile Works have emerged in Changchun, Harbin, Shenyang, Tianjin, Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places. Large quantities of precise and complex automotive cooperative products are constantly being shipped from these factories to the First Automobile Works.

These cooperative factories, distributed in various locations, are undergoing technical transformation and are producing fifteen categories of automotive cooperative products, including machinery, electrical appliances, chemicals, and rubber, according to the principle of professional division of labor.

China's original automotive repair industry had a very weak foundation. Although many automotive repair shops and hardware and electrical equipment factories were able to produce and supply spare parts for imported automobiles in the past, they did not have specific technical data or unified technical standards, and could not supply cooperative products for the newly built automobile manufacturing factories. In the process of trial manufacturing and small-batch production of cooperative products for the First Automobile Works, each cooperative factory generally organized a trial manufacturing committee or trial manufacturing group to carefully study the complete set of technical data supplied by the Soviet Union, continuously improve工艺equipment and technical operating procedures on the basis of the original production, and began to establish a technical inspection system. After the original Changchun Small Hardware Factory was transformed into an auto parts factory, all the factory workers carefully studied the Soviet technical standard data supplied by the First Automobile Works. More than 80 cooperative products, such as machinery, electrical appliances, and bakelite, which they trial-produced, had relatively stable quality after being put into mass production. The main products they produced, such as foot-operated dimmer switches and air filters, have been well received after experiments by the First Automobile Works and inspections by the Central Laboratory of the Automotive Industry Administration Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building. More than 200 types of non-metallic products, such as rubber, bakelite, glass, oilcloth, and cork, trial-produced by chemical and light industrial factories in Shenyang, Tianjin, Shanghai and other places, have also completed trial production tasks ahead of schedule and have been put into mass production. Among them are plastic products and tempered glass that China could not produce in the past. The staff of the Dalian Plastic Factory, which was expanded from the Celluloid Laboratory of the Lüda City Industrial Bureau, began trial-producing automobile steering wheels in July 1954. They held more than 140 technical research meetings and put forward more than 500 rationalization proposals, and finally, with the help of Soviet experts, found appropriate ingredient compositions and ratios, and solved technical problems such as steering wheel cracking and blistering. After appraisal, the cold and heat resistance of the steering wheel now fully meets the specified standards. The distributors, regulators, and induction coils produced by the China Tool Machinery Factory and the Xin Su and Jianshe Transportation Equipment Factories in Shanghai can guarantee the needs of the automobile factory in terms of quantity and quality after repeated trial production by the workers.

At present, of the more than 400 cooperative products required for manufacturing the "Liberation" brand automobile, most of the cooperative products can be supplied in batches and meet the needs of this year's automobile production, except for a few electrical appliances that have not yet been finally qualified and cannot be supplied in batches.

    为了制造大批精密复杂的汽车协作产品
    许多协作工厂提高了技术水平
    新华社长春12日电　新华社记者任冰如报道：随着第一汽车制造厂的建立，在长春、哈尔滨、沈阳、天津、北京、南京、上海等地，出现了一批为第一汽车制造厂生产协作产品的工厂。大批精密复杂的汽车协作产品，正不断从这些工厂运到第一汽车制造厂。
    分布在各地的这些协作工厂正在进行技术改造，并且按照（专业分工的原则，生产机械、电器、化工、橡胶等十五类汽车协作产品。
    中国原有的汽车修配工业的基础很薄弱。许多汽车修配厂和五金、电料器材工厂，过去虽然能够生产和供应进口汽车的配件，但是都没有一定的技术资料和统一的技术标准，不能供应新建的汽车制造工厂的协作产品。各个协作厂在为第一汽车制造厂试制和小批生产协作产品的过程中，一般都组织了试制委员会或试制小组，认真地学习了苏联供应的成套的技术资料，在原有的生产基础上不断地改进工艺设备和技术操作规程，并且开始建立了技术检验制度。原长春小五金厂在改建成为汽车配件厂以后，全厂职工认真学习了第一汽车制造厂供应的苏联的技术标准资料，他们试制出来的机械、电器和胶木等八十多项协作产品，在成批生产以后，质量比较稳定。他们生产的脚踏变光开关和空气滤清器等主要产品，经过第一汽车制造厂的实验和第一机械工业部汽车工业管理局中央实验室的检验，都得到好评。沈阳、天津、上海等地化学工业和轻工业工厂试制的橡胶、胶木、玻璃、漆布、软木等几类非金属产品，也已经有二百多项提前完成试制任务投入了成批生产。其中有中国以往不能生产的塑料产品和钢化玻璃等。由旅大市工业局赛璐珞实验室扩建成的大连塑料厂的职工，从1954年7月开始试制汽车方向盘。他们先后召开了一百四十多次技术研究会，提出了五百多件合理化建议，终于在苏联专家的帮助下，找出了适当的配料成分和比例，解决了方向盘裂纹和起泡等技术问题。经过鉴定，方向盘的耐寒和耐热性能现在都完全达到了规定的标准。上海的中国工具机械厂和新苏、建设两个交通器材厂，负责生产的分电器、调节器、感应线圈等产品，经过职工多次的试制，在数量和质量方面都能够保证汽车厂生产的需要。
    目前，制造“解放牌”汽车所需要的四百多项协作产品，除少数几种电气器材还没有最后鉴定合格，没有能成批供应以外，大部分协作产品已经可以成批供应和满足今年汽车生产的需要。
