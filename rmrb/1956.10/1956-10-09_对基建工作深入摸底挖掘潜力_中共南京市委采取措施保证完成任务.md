In-depth Investigation of Basic Construction Work to Tap Potential

The Nanjing Municipal Committee of the CPC Takes Measures to Ensure Completion of Tasks

(Our Dispatch) The Nanjing Municipal Committee of the CPC has, for the past half-month, mobilized relevant departments to conduct a thorough investigation of current basic construction work. Measures have been taken in all aspects to ensure the completion of this year's basic construction tasks.

This year, Nanjing has more than 1,400 basic construction projects, with a construction area of 1.43 million square meters and a total investment increase of 91.96% compared to last year. Due to the rapid increase in tasks, late issuance of directives, and insufficient preparation and coordination in various aspects such as materials, labor, and transportation, the city only completed 32.85% of the total annual investment from January to August this year.

The Nanjing Municipal Committee of the CPC attaches great importance to this serious situation and has now listed basic construction work as one of the primary tasks of the Municipal Committee. The Secretariat of the Municipal Committee has also designated a secretary to be specifically responsible for the detailed leadership of basic construction work. The secretary personally organized seven groups consisting of personnel from relevant departments, and dispatched more than 40 cadres to go deep into various basic construction units to conduct detailed investigations and verification of data on land requisition, design progress, material preparation, construction forces, and transportation. Based on a comprehensive understanding of the situation, a detailed ranking of various projects was carried out. At the same time, relevant departments carefully calculated and tapped potential from all aspects. For example, materials and construction departments actively overcame the shortage of materials by clearing construction sites, inventorying stocks, and demolishing abandoned houses and dangerous city walls, and tried to adopt many substitutes. Brick and tile factories also made their best efforts to increase production by 30 to 40 million bricks. The labor department originally lacked more than 40,000 workers. After various adjustments and verification of plans, scattered construction workers from various locations were concentrated, basically balancing the labor plan. The transportation department did not have enough transportation vehicles. Measures are now being taken to accelerate vehicle dispatch and turnover, and 30 self-provided vehicles and 70 night-shift vehicles have been mobilized and organized to participate in transportation, expanding the transportation volume by 139,000 tons, so that the transportation capacity meets the needs of the engineering tasks.

After unified arrangement and repeated scheduling and balancing, it is estimated that in addition to the originally planned projects that can be completed as scheduled, more than 8 million yuan of basic construction tasks can be completed. This not only ensures that this year's basic construction plan is based on a positive and reliable foundation, but also ensures that important projects are not delayed. Among them, important projects such as the main factory buildings and workshops of the Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, Potash Fertilizer Plant, Scientific Instrument Factory, and Power Plant can be completed as scheduled. Projects such as the Vegetable Oil Factory, Soap Factory, and Cannery, which were originally scheduled to be constructed next year, can be completed within this year. In addition, 347 welfare facility projects can also be completed this year. (Lu Daye)

　　对基建工作深入摸底挖掘潜力
    中共南京市委采取措施保证完成任务
    本报讯　中共南京市委近半月来发动有关部门，对当前基本建设工作进行了摸底排队，从各方面采取措施，保证今年基本建设任务的完成。
    南京市今年有基本建设工程一千四百多项，建筑面积达一百四十三万平方公尺，投资总额比去年增长91.96％。由于任务急剧增多，下达又迟，加以材料、劳动力、交通运输等各个环节准备不足和配合不够密切，全市今年1月到8月只完成全年投资总额的32.85％。
    中共南京市委十分重视这一严重局面，目前已把基本建设工作列为市委当前首要工作之一。市委书记处还指定一位书记专门负责对基本建设工作的具体领导，亲自组织由有关部门参加的七个小组，抽调四十多名干部，深入各基本建设单位，分别对土地征用、设计进度、材料准备、施工力量、交通运输等方面进行了详细摸底和核实资料，并在全面掌握情况的基础上，对各项工程进行了细致排队。同时，有关部门又从各方面精打细算，挖掘潜力。如材料、施工部门，通过清理工地、清点库存，拆除废弃房屋危险城墙等办法，积极克服材料不足的困难，并设法采用许多代用品。砖瓦厂也尽最大努力，增加了三千万块到四千万块砖。劳动部门原来缺四万多工人，经过多方面调度和核实计划，把分散各地的零星建筑工人集中起来，使劳动力计划基本上取得平衡。交通运输部门运输工具不够，现在正采取措施加速车辆调度和周转，并动员和组织了自备车三十辆和夜班车七十辆参加运输，扩大运量十三万九千吨，使运输能力适应了工程任务的需要。
    经过统一安排和反复调度平衡，预计今年除原计划确定的项目可以如期完成外，还可多完成八百多万元的基本建设任务。这不仅使今年基本建设计划建立在积极可靠的基础上，而且保证了重要工程不致贻误。其中如南京磷肥厂、钾肥厂、科学仪器厂、发电厂的主厂房和车间等重要工程均可如期完成；本来要到明年才能施工的植物油厂、肥皂厂、罐头厂等工程，可以争取在年内完工；还有三百四十七个福利设施工程项目，也可在今年竣工。　（陆大业）
