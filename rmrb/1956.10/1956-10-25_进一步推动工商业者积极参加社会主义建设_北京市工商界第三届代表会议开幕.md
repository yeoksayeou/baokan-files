Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: The Third Representative Conference of the Beijing Industrial and Commercial Circles opened today. This conference will focus on discussing the future tasks of the industrial and commercial circles after the full industry-wide public-private partnership, to further promote the city's industrialists and businessmen to actively participate in socialist construction and better accept socialist transformation.

The representatives participating in the conference will also fully exchange experiences in improving the public-private partnership and participating in socialist labor competitions. The conference will also elect a new executive committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce.

More than 1,000 representatives from various industries and businesses participated in the conference.

After the full industry-wide public-private partnership of capitalist industry and commerce in Beijing, tremendous changes have taken place in all aspects. All private-sector employees have been assigned work, and most of them can actively participate in production and management, diligently study political theory, and their ideological awareness has greatly improved, with more and more progressive and advanced elements emerging. In the first half of this year alone, more than 440 private-sector personnel were rewarded by their enterprises for their achievements in production and management. However, some people in the industrial and commercial circles still have unnecessary concerns about their relationship with public representatives, are hesitant in their work, and are afraid to take responsibility; some also retain old ideological styles and look down on the masses of workers.

In his opening speech, Le Songsheng, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, based on the current changes and existing problems in the industrial and commercial circles, called on the city's industrialists and businessmen to study hard, actively participate in socialist labor competitions, play a backbone role in socialist construction, and contribute their own strength. He particularly emphasized the need to improve the public-private partnership in self-transformation. He said: The state treats us as its own people, so we should take the initiative to get closer to the Communist Party and the People's Government, to the public representatives and the masses of workers, and unite other private-sector personnel to jointly improve the public-private partnership.

Li Zhuchen, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the heads of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, the Democratic Women's Federation, the Democratic Youth Federation, and the China Democratic National Construction Association also spoke at the meeting today.

    进一步推动工商业者积极参加社会主义建设
    北京市工商界第三届代表会议开幕
    据新华社24日讯　北京市工商界第三届代表会议今天开幕，这次会议将着重讨论全行业公私合营后工商界今后的任务，以进一步推动全市工商业者积极参加社会主义建设，更好地接受社会主义改造。
    参加会议的代表还将充分交流搞好公私共事关系、参加社会主义劳动竞赛等经验。会议并将选举市工商联新的执行委员会。
    参加会议的有各行业工商业者代表一千多人。
    北京市资本主义工商业全行业公私合营后，各方面都起了巨大的变化。所有私方在职人员都被安排了工作，并且大部分都能积极参加生产和经营管理工作，努力学习政治理论，思想觉悟有了很大提高，进步和先进分子越来越多。在今年上半年里，就有四百四十多个私方人员由于在企业的生产和经营当中做出了成绩，受到企业的奖励。但工商界中还有一些人在对公方代表的关系上，存在着不必要的顾虑，工作上缩手缩脚，不敢负责；也有的人还存在着旧的思想作风，看不起职工群众。
    北京市工商业联合会主任委员乐松生在致开幕词中，根据目前工商界的变化情况和存在的问题，要求全市的工商业者努力学习，积极参加社会主义劳动竞赛，在社会主义建设中发挥骨干分子的作用，贡献出自己的力量。他特别强调在自我改造中必须搞好公私共事关系。他说：国家拿我们当自己人，我们就应该主动地靠拢共产党和人民政府、靠拢公方和工人群众，并团结其他私方人员共同搞好公私共事关系。
    中华全国工商业联合会副主任委员李烛尘和北京市的工会、民主妇女联合会、民主青年联合会、中国民主建国会等单位的负责人今天都在会上讲了话。
