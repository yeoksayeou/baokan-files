    Thinking of Zhang Taiyan in Remembrance of Lu Xun
    Song Yunbin
    This year marks the twentieth anniversary of Lu Xun's death and also the twentieth anniversary of Zhang Taiyan's death. Lu Xun and Zhang Taiyan had a teacher-student relationship, because Lu Xun, while in Tokyo, Japan, went with Xu Shoushang and others to listen to Zhang Taiyan's lectures. Zhang Taiyan passed away in June 1936. At that time, Lu Xun was just recovering from a serious illness and could not write articles. It wasn't until the beginning of October that Lu Xun wrote a piece called "About Mr. Taiyan: A Few Things," and later wrote "A Few Thoughts Occasioned by Mr. Taiyan," but it was not completed, becoming his final work.
    "About Mr. Taiyan: A Few Things," although a short essay, is worth a biography of Zhang Taiyan running to tens of thousands of words. Lu Xun believed that Zhang Taiyan's achievements "in revolutionary history are actually greater than in academic history." He pointed out that Zhang Taiyan's fighting spirit in those years was "truly invincible, inspiring people." He said: "Examining his life, he was the only person of his time to use a grand medal as a fan pendant and, standing at the gate of the Presidential Palace, vehemently denounced Yuan Shikai's insidious ambitions; he was also the only person of his time to be pursued and arrested seven times, imprisoned three times, and yet his revolutionary aspirations never wavered: this is the spirit of a sage, a model for future generations." However, Lu Xun also pointed out the shortcomings of his teacher. He said, "Although Mr. Taiyan initially appeared as a revolutionary, he later retreated to become a tranquil scholar, using the walls he built himself and those built with the help of others to isolate himself from the times." Being isolated from the times means being detached from the masses. Therefore, Lu Xun said, "Having left the masses, he gradually became decadent, and his later participation in pitch-pot games and acceptance of gifts were often met with disapproval by commentators." However, Lu Xun went on to explain, "But these are just minor flaws, not a complete loss of integrity in his later years." Lu Xun rebuked those frivolous literati who slandered Zhang Taiyan, saying, "Recently, some literary brokers, colluding with tabloids, have even written articles ridiculing Mr. Taiyan to congratulate themselves, which can truly be said to be 'small men do not want to see the beauty in others,' and also 'ants trying to shake a tree, ridiculously overestimating themselves!'" Finally, Lu Xun expressed his hope that the publishing house preparing to publish Zhang Taiyan's works would include Zhang Taiyan's "earlier fighting articles" to "allow Mr. Taiyan to resonate with future generations and live in the hearts of fighters."
    In the past, feudal society had a dogma: that juniors should only praise seniors, and subordinates should only praise superiors, and never criticize them. Didn't the Gongyang School have a set of so-called "Spring and Autumn righteousness" of "concealing the faults of the respected, concealing the faults of relatives, and concealing the faults of the virtuous"? Therefore, for someone like Lu Xun to draw conclusions about his teacher, with both praise and criticism, and with such pertinent criticism, was absolutely unique in the old feudal society.
    I say "absolutely unique" rather than "absolutely none" because Zhang Taiyan, like Lu Xun, also drew conclusions about his teacher, Yu Quyuan, also with praise and criticism, and with very pertinent criticism. Zhang Taiyan's "Biography of Mr. Yu" first affirmed his teacher's achievements in academic history, and narrated how he himself thought independently, often disagreeing with his teacher when interpreting scriptures, and then pointed out his teacher's shortcomings: "However, he could not forget fame and position; having widely read classics, down to popular novels and ballads, he loved people broadly with his writings, and his writing showed both flaws and merits; miscellaneous figures also often came to his door: these were his shortcomings." Such an article seems very ordinary now, but at that time it required the courage to oppose feudal dogma to dare to write it.
    Yu Quyuan had many disciples, but apart from Zhang Taiyan, no one else could write such a "Biography of Mr. Yu"; Zhang Taiyan also had many disciples, but apart from Lu Xun, no one else could write "About Mr. Taiyan: A Few Things." This is because both Zhang Taiyan and Lu Xun were rich in revolutionary spirit, had correct standpoints and viewpoints, and had clear likes and dislikes. However, in terms of achievements left in revolutionary history, Yu Quyuan is not even worth mentioning, and Zhang Taiyan is far inferior to Lu Xun. This cannot be measured by the teacher-student relationship. Han Yu of the Tang Dynasty had already said, "Disciples do not necessarily have to be inferior to their teachers, and teachers do not necessarily have to be more virtuous than their disciples." Zhuangzi said it even better: "Those who send you off all return from the cliff, you go far from here." In those years, Lu Xun studied "Shuowen" with Zhang Taiyan and also joined the revolutionary group "Guangfuhui" initiated by Zhang Taiyan and others, but Zhang Taiyan "returned from the cliff" and retreated to become a tranquil scholar, while Lu Xun galloped away, "going far from here."

    因纪念鲁迅而想到章太炎
    宋云彬
    今年是鲁迅逝世二十周年，也是章太炎逝世二十周年。鲁迅跟章太炎有师生之谊，因为鲁迅在日本东京的时候，曾经和许寿裳等一道去听章太炎讲学。章太炎是1936年6月间逝世的。那时候鲁迅大病初愈，还不能写文章，到了10月上旬，鲁迅才写了一篇“关于太炎先生二三事”，后来又写“因太炎先生而想起的二三事”，但没有完稿，成为绝笔了。
    “关于太炎先生二三事”虽然是一篇短短的杂文，却抵得上一篇数万言的章太炎评传。鲁迅认为章太炎的业绩，“留在革命史上的，实在比在学术史上还要大”。他指出章太炎当年的斗争精神，“真是所向披靡，令人神旺”。他说：“考其生平，以大勋章作扇坠，临总统府之门，大诟袁世凯的包藏祸心者，并世无第二人；七被追捕，三入牢狱，而革命之志，终不屈挠者，并世亦无第二人：这才是先哲的精神，后生的楷范。”然而鲁迅也指出了他老师的缺点。他说：“太炎先生虽先前也以革命家现身，后来却退居于宁静的学者，用自己所手造的和别人所帮造的墙，和时代隔绝了。”和时代隔绝也就是脱离民众。所以鲁迅说：“既离民众，渐入颓唐，后来的参与投壶，接收馈赠，遂每为论者所不满。”然而鲁迅接着就加以解释道：“但这也不过白圭之玷，并非晚节不终。”鲁迅呵斥那些诋毁章太炎的无聊文人道：“近有文侩，勾结小报，竟也作文奚落先生以自鸣得意，真可谓‘小人不欲成人之美’，而且‘蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量’了！”最后鲁迅表示，希望准备刊行章太炎著作的出版社，能够把章太炎“先前战斗的文章”给补刊进去，“使先生和后生相印，活在战斗者的心中”。
    过去封建社会有一种教条，就是：晚辈对于前辈，小辈对于长辈，只许赞扬，不准批评。公羊家不是有一套“为尊者讳，为亲者讳，为贤者讳”的所谓“春秋大义”吗？所以像鲁迅那样，弟子给老师做结论，做到有赞扬也有批评，而且批评得那么中肯，在从前封建社会里是绝无仅有的。
    我不说“绝无”而说“绝无仅有”，那是因为章太炎跟鲁迅一样，给他的老师俞曲园做过结论，也是有赞扬也有批评，而且批评得十分中肯的。章太炎写的那篇“俞先生传”，首先肯定了他老师留在学术史上的业绩，并叙述了他自己怎么样独立思考，说解经义的时候往往跟他老师的意见相左，然后指出他老师的短处：“然不能忘名位；既博览典籍，下至稗官歌谣，以笔札泛爱人，其文辞瑕适并见；杂流亦时时至门下：此其所短也。”这样的文章，现在看起来似乎极平常，但在当时却需要有反对封建教条的勇气，才敢下笔的。
    俞曲园门弟子众多，可是除了章太炎，没有第二人能写这样的一篇“俞先生传”；章太炎门弟子也不少，可是除了鲁迅，没有第二人能写“关于太炎先生二三事”。这是因为章太炎和鲁迅都富有革命精神，立场观点正确，是非爱憎分明的缘故。然而就留在革命史上的业绩来讲，俞曲园根本谈不到，章太炎远不及鲁迅。这就不能拿师生关系来衡量了。唐朝韩愈已经说过：“弟子不必不如师，师不必贤于弟子。”庄子说得更好：“送君者皆自崖而返，君自此远矣。”当年鲁迅跟章太炎学“说文”，还加入了章太炎他们所发起的革命团体“光复会”，然而章太炎却“自崖而返”，退居于宁静的学者，鲁迅则奔轶绝尘，“自此远矣”。
