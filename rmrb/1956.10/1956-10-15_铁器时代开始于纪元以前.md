    The Iron Age Began Before the Common Era
    In the article "Celestial Stone" written by Comrade Gao Shiqi on page 7 of your newspaper on September 10th, it was stated: "People learned to extract iron from iron ore around 1000 AD. Initially, they used iron to make tools such as plows, hoes, shovels, and axes. This marked the beginning of the Iron Age." The author's statement that the Iron Age began around 1000 AD is incorrect. According to the general opinion of historians, the beginning of the Iron Age in China would not have been later than the early Warring States period, dating back to several hundred years BC. In Europe, the Nordic peoples knew about iron in the first century BC. The discovery and use of iron, whether in China or abroad, occurred before the Common Era, not after.

    铁器时代开始于纪元以前
    9月10日你报第七版高士其同志写的“天石”一文中说：“人们学会了从铁矿石里炼出铁来，还是公元后一千年的事。最初，他们用铁制成了犁、锄、铲、斧等工具。这是铁器时代的开始”。作者把铁器时代的开始说成是公元后一千年的事，是错误的。根据一般历史学者的意见，我国铁器时代的开始至迟也不会迟于战国初年，时间在公元前几百年。而在欧洲，北欧人在纪元前一世纪已知有铁。铁的发现及使用，无论在中国或外国，都是在纪元以前，而不是纪元以后。
