Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd. The Soviet Union's National Welfare Law came into effect on October 1st. From this day on, elderly workers and staff on all labor fronts in the Soviet Union began to enjoy their guaranteed later years.

Factories and enterprises in Moscow have been celebrating and sending off those who have spent many years of labor. The administrative departments of the factories are preparing retirement documents for the retired workers and staff, calculating the amount of allowances they should receive; clubs are holding farewell banquets; and many elderly workers who have worked in the workshops for decades are handing over their tools and lathes to their successors.

At the Moscow Three Mountains Textile Factory, 396 elderly workers began to receive state pension allowances. The female worker, Aobaolinskaia, who had worked in the factory for 50 years, left her post with reluctance on this day, and for the first time did not go to work at the factory at the call of the whistle. The old worker, Titov, who participated in the 1905 revolutionary battles, has woven enough cloth in the factory for more than 50 years to wrap around the equator four times. On October 1st, he cleaned the lathe he had used for more than 20 years very carefully and solemnly handed it over to his trained student.

At the Red Warrior Factory, 110 elderly workers have obtained the right to deserved rest. The female worker, Xiebrova, who started working in the factory in her youth, recalled her glorious working life at the factory's farewell banquet. She joined the Communist Party in the factory, won the Lenin Medal, and now has obtained a national allowance sufficient for her old age. She expressed her intention to continue to keep in touch with the factory and teach her skills to the younger generation.

The elderly worker, Petrova, who worked in a Moscow street bookstore, can receive a monthly pension allowance of 500 rubles after retiring on the 1st. An old chemistry teacher, 77 years old, receives a monthly pension allowance of 647 rubles from the 1st.

After the implementation of the new National Welfare Law, the Soviet government will greatly increase its expenditures in this area. In the October District of Moscow alone, the government will pay more than 50 million rubles in pensions every month. The pension recipients living in a building on Vanlozafu Street in Moscow used to receive a total of more than 29,900 rubles per month, but now they will receive a total of more than 55,000 rubles per month. An elderly couple in Moscow used to receive only 420 rubles per month, but from October 1st of this year, it will increase to 1,016 rubles per month.

    苏联国家优抚金法开始生效
    许多老工人领到津贴安度晚年生活
    新华社莫斯科3日电　从10月1日起，苏联国家优抚金法开始生效了。全苏联各个劳动战线上的老年工人和职员从这天起，开始安度他们有保证的晚年生活。
    莫斯科各工厂企业这几天来都在欢送这些度过了长年劳动岁月的人们。工厂里的行政管理部门在为退休的工人、职员们准备退休的证件，计算应领津贴的数目；俱乐部里在举办欢送的宴会；车间里许多工作了几十年的老年工人在把工具和车床交给自己的接班人。
    莫斯科三山纺织厂有三百九十六名老年工人开始领得国家的养老津贴。在工厂劳动了五十年的女工奥保琳斯卡雅这一天带着恋恋不舍的心情离开了劳动岗位，第一次不随着汽笛的呼唤到工厂去上班。曾经参加过1905年革命战斗的老工人季托夫五十多年来在厂中织出的布匹已经能够绕地球赤道四周。在10月1日，他把自己使用了二十多年的车床收拾得非常干净，慎重地交给了他训练出来的学生。
    在红色壮士工厂里，有一百一十名老年工人获得了应有的休息权利。从姑娘时代就开始在工厂工作的女工歇勃洛娃，在工厂的欢送宴会上想起自己的光荣劳动的一生，她在工厂里加入了共产党，获得了列宁勋章，现在又获得了足够老年生活的国家津贴。她表示要继续和工厂联系，把自己的技术教给年青的一代。
    在莫斯科的街道售书亭工作的老年劳动者彼得洛娃1日起退休后，每月可以获得五百卢布的养老津贴。一个七十七岁的老化学教员从1日起每月获得六百四十七卢布的养老津贴。
    实行新的国家优抚法后，苏联政府将大大增加这方面的支出。仅仅在莫斯科的十月区，政府每月就要付出五千多万卢布的养老金。在莫斯科凡洛扎伏特街上的一幢楼房里居住的养老金领取者们过去每月共领到两万九千九百多卢布，现在每月将共领到五万五千多卢布。莫斯科有一对年老夫妇，过去每月仅领四百二十卢布的津贴，从今年10月1日起，将增加到每月一千零十六卢布。
