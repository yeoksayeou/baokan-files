    My Understanding of Genetics
    Fan Qianzhong, Director of the Zoology Teaching and Research Group, Nanjing Agricultural College
    Genetics is a fundamental discipline in biological science. Whether it is organic evolution, the basic theories of biological science, or practical plant and animal breeding, as well as congenital pathological problems in medicine, all are built on the foundation of genetic knowledge. Chinese biological scientists divide genetics into so-called "old genetics" and "new genetics." In reality, genetics itself has no new or old, but rather different theories and different views for explaining genetic phenomena. In terms of the content of these two schools of thought, each has its own merits and demerits, and neither can be completely negated. As people know, "old genetics" refers to the theories of Mendel and Morgan schools; "new genetics" refers to the theories of Michurin and Lysenko schools.
    The recent genetics symposium held in Qingdao brought together many scholars to express their opinions and discuss various issues in genetics. This is a very good start and example for promoting science. Since returning to China in 1934, I have taught genetics courses for more than ten years, and of course I am very interested in the current enthusiastic discussion of genetics issues. Now, based on my own views, I would like to offer some opinions on the issues of new and old genetics.
    The most common phenomena in the biological world are heredity and variation. Heredity and variation can be seen everywhere in organisms. "Heredity," we can simply say, is the phenomenon that offspring exhibit characteristics that conserve those of the parents, or it can be said that offspring have a tendency to conserve the characteristics of the parents. As the saying goes, "plant melons and get melons, plant beans and get beans," this is heredity. According to the scope of heredity, it can also be divided into the genetic characteristics of species, the genetic characteristics of subspecies, the genetic characteristics of varieties, the genetic characteristics of races, and the genetic characteristics of individuals, etc. Of course, the genetic characteristics of a small scope must first conform to the characteristics of a large scope. "Variation" is the phenomenon or characteristic that offspring exhibit characteristics that are different from those of the parents. Heredity and variation are objectively existing facts of nature in organisms. Heredity and variation are two contradictory aspects; heredity is conservative, and variation is innovative. The result of the continuous movement and unity of these two contradictory phenomena in nature can lead to organic evolution. If there is only heredity and no variation, or only variation and no heredity, then the laws of the biological world would become unimaginable, and evolution would become impossible. Therefore, genetics is the basic theory for explaining organic evolution. The purpose of studying genetics is to find out how the form and nature of the parents, that is, the characteristics, are passed on to the offspring, and at the same time to explain what the material basis for transmitting these genetic characteristics is; in terms of variation, it is to answer what influence organisms are subject to that causes variation to occur, what is the mechanism of variation, which of the variations are heritable, and which are not, and whether there is so-called directional variation. If the above questions can be answered satisfactorily, then a complete understanding of the mechanism of evolutionary phenomena can also be obtained.
    During their life cycle, organisms are affected by environmental living conditions and undergo certain variations, which are called acquired characteristics. Can acquired characteristics be inherited? This question has attracted the most attention from people since very early times until now. I think that acquired characteristics can be inherited, but the influence of environmental living conditions must pass through the genetic material of germ cells in order to be inherited. The genetic material in general body cells, after a long period of influence from living conditions, can also indirectly affect the genetic material of germ cells, and in this way can also become heritable characteristics. Acquired characteristics are different from generally so-called "injuries." "Injuries" are not acquired characteristics. For example, the children born to blind people are definitely not blind. The children born to people who are missing a hand or a foot are definitely not missing a hand or a foot. These all prove that injuries cannot be inherited. Suppose injuries could be inherited, then everyone might carry the scars of ancestral injuries, wouldn't we all become a collection of injuries? Weismann cut off the tails of mice for more than ten generations, and the offspring born to the mice did not therefore have no tails. Weismann believed that this was evidence that acquired characteristics cannot be inherited, which of course was a mistake. New geneticists believe that living conditions can be inherited through metabolism. I don't think the inheritance of acquired characteristics is that simple. The problem of the inheritance of acquired characteristics must be studied from how the environment and living conditions affect genetic material in order to obtain a complete answer. The fact that organisms can only develop heritable acquired characteristics under the influence of long-term living conditions is an important factor. The inheritance of acquired characteristics has great significance in organic evolution. If we say that acquired characteristics cannot be inherited, then evolution becomes impossible. Lamarck's recognition that acquired characteristics can be inherited is the most important law in biological evolution; Lamarck's principle of "use and disuse" to explain the inheritance of acquired characteristics has great significance.
    New geneticists believe that asexual hybridization can cause variation, and believe that grafting-type asexual hybridization is an example of mosaic inheritance and cannot be inherited. I would like to cite some specific examples to illustrate this point. The honey peaches planted in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are all cultivated by grafting. The rootstock is the hairy peach (a wild peach), and the scion is various varieties of excellent honey peaches. The peaches that grow after grafting are not affected by the wild hairy peach rootstock. Even if the peaches have some slight changes, that is due to the influence of the cultivation environment. If we say that the asexual hybridization rootstock can affect the scion and can be inherited, it must also be inherited through the sexual reproduction of the peach tree. If the buds on the scion are affected by the environment and undergo somatic cell variation, and then propagated by asexual vegetative bud grafting or branch grafting, of course it can be inherited, but this is just an example of vegetative heredity. For example, in the citrus producing areas of Jiangjin and Jintang counties in Sichuan, before liberation, local fruits were propagated by seedling cultivation, that is, by seed propagation. As a result, because of sexual reproduction, many segregation of forms and natures occurred, resulting in uneven varieties in the orchards, uneven sourness and sweetness, and loss of the quality of the citrus. Later, they switched to selecting parent trees and propagating them by grafting. As a result, within a few years, excellent parent fruit trees were systematically and massively propagated, greatly improving the quality of the citrus. This is a good example of using asexual selection and propagation to improve fruit quality. At that time, no one heard that the scion was affected by the rootstock, producing the result of asexual hybridization. In parks everywhere, large pots of chrysanthemums cultivated by branch grafting are usually displayed in the autumn. Many chrysanthemums of various colors and various petal shapes grow on a single main stem, colorful and very beautiful. This is done by grafting various chrysanthemum scions onto the branches of distantly related plants using branch grafting. This method has been used for many years, and no one has heard that the chrysanthemum scions are affected by the rootstock branches. Recently, experiments on asexual hybridization of animals by exchanging proteins between eggs of different varieties of chickens and duck eggs or goose eggs have been widely conducted domestically, and are generally successful. The variation produced by this asexual hybridization must pass through the sexual hybridization of this variant in order to pass the variation to the next generation and prove that it is heritable. The variation that occurs in protein exchange is due to the influence of different nutrients. If this variation cannot be preserved by sexual reproduction, it cannot be preserved in animals, because we cannot use asexual methods to propagate higher animals. I think that using the exchange protein experiment for asexual hybridization of animals as a purely animal problem research is possible, but the practical significance is a question.
    Agronomists in South China have used moonflower as a scion grafted onto yam rootstock, which increases the size of the yam tubers, thus greatly increasing the yield, reaching about 10,000 catties per mu. This is an important discovery in crop cultivation technology and is extremely valuable for practical promotion. This is the result of the scion accelerating photosynthesis and affecting the rootstock, and does not prove the problem that asexual hybridization can be inherited by grafting. If you want to know whether it is heritable, it must be proven through sexual reproduction. In general, plants that are asexually propagated show degeneration of the part used for vegetative use after sexual reproduction. The significant degeneration of potato tubers when propagated by sexual reproduction is a clear example. I speculate that grafting moonflower onto yam rootstock cannot affect the heredity of yam. If large yams grown after grafting can still maintain the characteristics of large tubers without grafting and re-propagated asexually, this can indicate that grafting affects the heredity of the vegetative body of the tubers. This is an even quicker way to improve yam yield and is worth studying.
    What is the material basis of heredity? This is the most basic question in genetics. If we have a thorough understanding of the material basis of heredity, then the mechanisms of heredity and variation can be easily solved. There must be a material basis for organisms to undergo heredity and variation. Although genetic material has different names in genetics, such as Darwin calling it "gemmules," old geneticists calling it "genes" or "factors," and new geneticists calling it "granules," they are all actually meant to explain the function of this genetic material. Genetic material must exist in cells, because the zygote is formed by the union of male germ cells and female germ cells. Male germ cells are sperm. Of course, the head of the sperm is its nucleus, and the sperm carries very little cytoplasm, while the male and female gametes give the zygote equal heredity. This shows that the genetic material exists in the nucleus. We do not deny that the cytoplasm also has a hereditary role, such as the heredity of the left and right spiral of snail shells, which is an example of cytoplasmic heredity. What structure in the nucleus has genetic material? The chromosomes formed by chromatin in the nucleus must be genetic material. Various plants have a certain number of chromosomes, a certain shape, and a certain behavior during cell mitosis and meiosis. Numerous studies in cell genetics have proven that genetic material is in the chromosomes. If we deny the "chromosome heredity theory" and look for the material basis of heredity in other ways, we will not get a complete answer. As for what exactly is genetic material? Geneticists generally believe that it is composed of chemical elements and its nature is very similar to the function of enzymes. They have stability and also instability. Instability manifests as variation, and stability manifests as heredity. We know that chemical molecules are easily changed, and its changes are the occurrence of variation. I believe that the genetic material in germ cells is relatively stable, and the reproductive organs and reproductive function of general animals and plants are also relatively conservative and stable. The genetic material of somatic cells is relatively easily shaken. Environmental living conditions can directly affect the genetic material of somatic cells and can also affect the genetic material of germ cells. The length of time of influence is a very important factor. Living conditions can of course also affect the genetic material of germ cells through somatic cells. In the future, due to the progress of chemical research on genetic material, chemical genetics will inevitably be separated from genetics.

    我对遗传学的认识
    南京农学院动物学教研组主任　范谦衷
    遗传学在生物科学中是一门基础学科。无论是有机进化，生物科学的基本理论或实践上的动植物育种以及医学上先天性病理的问题都是建筑在遗传学知识基础上的。我国生物科学工作者把遗传学划分为所谓“旧遗传学”和“新遗传学”。实际上遗传学本无新旧之分，只是解释遗传现象有不同的学说和不同的见解而已。就这两派学说的内容来讲也各有所是，各有所非，是不能全盘抹煞的。人们知道，“旧遗传学”指孟德尔、摩尔根学派的学说；“新遗传学”指米丘林、李森科学派的学说。
    最近在青岛举行的遗传学座谈会，集合许多学者在一起，各抒己见，畅谈遗传学上各种问题。这是昌明科学很好的开端和范例。我从1934年回国以后，曾经担任过遗传学课程的教授工作十多年，当然对于目前的热烈讨论遗传学问题很感兴趣。今根据一己之见，对新旧遗传学问题提出一些意见。
    生物界最普遍的现象就是遗传和变异。无论那里，在生物体上都可以看到遗传和变异。“遗传”，我们可以简单地说是子体有表现保守亲体特征的现象，也可说是子体有保守亲体的特性的趋向。俗话说“种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆”，这就是遗传。根据遗传性的范围，也可以区分为种的遗传特征，亚种的遗传特征，变种的遗传特征，种族的遗传特征、个体的遗传特征等。当然小范围的遗传特征一定先要符合大范围的特征。“变异”是子体表现有同亲体不相同特征的现象或特性。遗传和变异是自然界生物客观存在的事实。遗传和变异是对立矛盾的两方面，遗传性是保守，变异是革新。这两种矛盾的现象在自然界不息地运动和统一的结果，就可以发生有机进化。只有遗传而没有变异，或只有变异而没有遗传，那末生物界的规律就成为不可想像的了，进化也成为不可能。因此遗传学是解释有机进化的基本理论。学习遗传学的目的是为了找出亲体形性，即特征如何传递给子体，同时说明传递这遗传形性的物质基础是什么；在变异方面是为了解答生物体受了什么影响就要发生变异，发生变异的机制是什么，发生的变异那一种是有遗传性的，那一种是没有遗传性的，有没有所谓定向的变异。如果能完满地解释上述问题，那末对进化现象的机制也将可以得到完满的解答。
    生物在生活期中受环境生活条件的影响发生某种变异，这种变异就称为获得性。获得性是否可以遗传？这个问题从很早一直到现在都最能引起人们注意。我认为获得性是可以遗传的，但环境生活条件的影响必须通过生殖细胞的遗传物质才能遗传。一般身体细胞内的遗传物质经过生活条件长时期的影响也可以间接影响到生殖细胞的遗传物质，这样也可以成为可遗传性的形性。获得性和一般所谓“残伤”是有区别的。“残伤”不是获得性。例如盲人所生的子女决不是盲人。缺手或缺足的人所生的子女决不是缺手或缺足的。这些都证明残伤不能遗传。假定残伤可以遗传，那末每个人都可能带有前代祖先残伤的疤痕，这岂不是我们都要成为残伤的总汇了。魏斯门斩断鼠尾十多代，鼠所生的子代并不因而无尾。魏斯门认为这是获得性不能遗传的证据，这当然是个错误。新遗传学者认为生活条件通过新陈代谢就可以遗传。我觉得获得性的遗传并不这样简单。获得性的遗传问题，一定要从环境、生活条件怎样影响遗传物质上去研究，才能得到完满的解答。生物体在长时期生活条件影响下才能发生获得性的遗传是一个重要的因素。获得性遗传在有机进化上有重大的意义。假如我们说获得性不能遗传，那末进化也成为不可能了。拉马克承认获得性能遗传是生物进化上最重要的规律；拉马克以“用进废退”的原理来解释获得性遗传有很重大的意义。
    新遗传学者认为无性杂交能发生变异，并且认为嫁接式的无性杂交是镶嵌遗传的事例，并不能遗传。我想举出一些具体事例来说明这个问题。在江苏、浙江一带所种植的水蜜桃都是用嫁接的方法培植的。砧木用毛桃（一种野生桃），接穗就用各种品种的优良水蜜桃，长大后结出来的桃子并没有受砧木野生毛桃的影响，即使桃子有了些微改变，那是受了栽培环境的影响。如果说无性杂交砧木能影响接穗能遗传，也必须通过桃树的有性生殖而遗传，假如接穗上的芽受环境影响发生体细胞变异，再用无性营养体芽接或枝接繁殖，当然是可以遗传的，这不过是营养体遗传的事例。又如四川江津、金堂等县产柑橘区域，在解放以前当地果实都用生苗栽培繁殖，就是用种籽繁殖，结果因为有性生殖的关系，发生许多形性的分离，以致果园品种不齐，酸甜不均，损失了柑橘的品质。以后他们改用选择亲本树用嫁接方法繁殖，结果在几年内，优良亲本果树就系统地大量繁殖起来，大大改良了柑橘的品质。这是用无性选择繁殖法来改良果品的很好的例子，当时并没有听到接穗受到了砧木的影响，产生无性杂交的结果。各地公园中到秋季大都陈列大盆用枝接栽培的菊花，各种颜色和各种花瓣形状的许多菊花长在一本主杆上，五色缤纷，很是美观。这是用各种菊花接穗，用枝接接在远缘植物的枝子上的，这种方法已经用了许多年，没有听说菊花接穗受砧木枝子的影响。近来在国内广泛实验了用不同品种的鸡蛋同鸭蛋或鹅蛋做蛋白交换动物无性杂交的试验，一般是成功的。这种无性杂交所产生的变异，必须经过这种变异体的有性杂交，才能把变异传递给后代，才能证明有遗传性。蛋白交换所发生的变异是受不同营养物质影响的缘故。这种变异如不能用有性生殖保存，在动物中是无法保存的，因为我们不能用无性方法来繁殖高等动物。我认为用交换蛋白试验动物无性杂交作为纯粹动物问题研究是可以的，但究竟有多大的实践意义是一个问题。
    在华南的农学家们曾经用月光花做接穗嫁接在山薯砧木上，使山薯块根增大，因此产量大为增加，每亩达万斤左右。这是作物栽培技术上的重要发现，极有推广实践的价值。这是接穗加速光合作用影响接本的结果，并不证明无性杂交用嫁接能遗传的问题。如果要知道它是否有遗传性，必须经过有性生殖才能证明。一般无性繁殖的植物，经过有性生殖，营养体利用的部分大都表现退化。马铃薯用有性生殖繁殖，它的块茎大形退化就是显明的例子。我推想，月光花嫁接在山薯砧木上不可能影响山薯的遗传性。嫁接后生长的大山薯，不经嫁接再用无性繁殖，如果仍能保持大块根的特点，这可以说明嫁接影响了块根营养体的遗传性。这更是改进山薯产量的捷径，值得研究。
    遗传物质基础是什么？这是遗传学最基本的问题。对遗传物质基础如果有透彻的了解，那末遗传和变异发生的机制问题就可以迎刃而解。生物能发生遗传和变异一定有它的物质基础，遗传物质在遗传学上虽然有不同的称呼，如达尔文称它为“胚芽”，旧遗传学家称它为“基因”或“因子”，新遗传学家称它为“颗粒”，其实都是要说明这遗传物质的作用。遗传物质一定存在细胞中，因为接合子是由雄性生殖细胞和雌性生殖细胞结合成的。雄性生殖细胞就是精子。当然精子的头部就是它的核，精子带入的细胞质很少，而雌雄性配子带给接合子的遗传性却是相等的。这就说明遗传物质是存在核中的，我们并不否认细胞质也有遗传的作用，如螺壳左右旋的遗传就是细胞质遗传的例子。核中什么结构有遗传物质，核中染色质形成的染色体必然就是遗传物质。各种植物的染色体有一定的数目，有一定的形态，当细胞有丝和减数分裂时，它有一定的行为。由细胞遗传学许许多多的研究，证明遗传物质是在染色体中的。如果我们否定了“染色体遗传学说”，向别的途径去找遗传物质基础，那是得不到完满的解答的。至于遗传物质究竟是什么东西？一般遗传学家都认为是化学原素组成的，性质很像酶的作用。它们有稳固性同时也有动摇性。动摇性就表现了变异，稳固性就表现了遗传。我们知道化学分子是很容易变化的，它的变化也就是变异的发生。我认为生殖细胞中的遗传物质是较为稳固的，一般动植物的生殖器官和生殖作用也是比较保守稳固的。而体细胞的遗传物质是比较容易动摇的。环境生活条件可以直接影响体细胞的遗传物质，也可以影响生殖细胞的遗传物质。影响岁月的长短是一个很重要的因素。生活条件当然也可以通过体细胞再影响到生殖细胞的遗传物质。今后由于遗传物质化学的研究的进步，必将从遗传学分出化学遗传学来。
