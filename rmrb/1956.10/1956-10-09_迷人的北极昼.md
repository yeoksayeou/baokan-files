Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th—The Soviet Arctic region is currently experiencing the long Arctic day. "Komsomolskaya Pravda" special correspondent Borodin reported from there, "The sunny nights in the Arctic are enchanting, and everyone who comes to the Arctic for the first time will experience this."

Borodin said that it was not until mid-July that the melting ice in the Yenisei River flowed into the sea, and the accumulated snow on both banks slid down the slopes of the riverbank. Under the sunshine day and night, tender green grass grew on the frozen soil. Clumps of gray alder and willow catkins swayed, and faint red strawberries, gooseberries, and sky-blue glassworts could be seen between the unmelted ice floes and snowdrifts. After a misty warm rain, the entire frozen tundra was covered with white daisies.

In this bright and sunny season, the happiest people in the village of Levisha on the Yenisei River are the fishermen. At the fishing grounds, songs and laughter never cease, especially when the fishermen go out to sea in teams to fish. The fishermen cast large nets as long as half a kilometer from the boat, and then use electric machines to drag them up. Every day, thousands of kilograms of salmon, trout, sturgeon, etc. are sent to the factory for processing.

In the past, people thought that cultivating land within the Arctic Circle was an impossible dream. But now, man has conquered nature.

The collective farms here use hotbeds to grow tomatoes, cabbage, swedes, and radishes. And at the end of June, when the land begins to thaw and warm up, people plant things in the open air. In autumn, the collective farms can harvest well-grown vegetables, radishes, and potatoes.

In the evening, a large group of cattle noisily entered the village, and soon the whole village was filled with the aroma of fresh milk. In this remote area, not long ago people could only drink canned milk. Now, collective farm members can already get about four thousand liters of milk a year from each cow they raise.

Since ancient times, this place has been a rich source of game. The people of Levisha village have a set of hunting methods. In autumn, hunters capture arctic foxes near the riverbank and put them in cages until winter when the fur is grown. Here, people eat venison, wear deer skins, and use deer sleds. Reindeer herders use a few pillars to support deer skins and canvas, building so-called "Baroque" white huts. The old-fashioned smoke-filled tents no longer exist. After labor, the "Baroque" is always crowded with people studying.

　　迷人的北极昼
    新华社莫斯科8日电　现在，苏联的北极地区正在经历着漫长的北极昼。“共青团真理报”特派记者鲍罗廷从那里报道说，“北极地区的有太阳之夜是迷人的，每一个头一次到北极的人都会体会到这一点。”
    鲍罗廷说，直到7月中旬，叶尼塞河中的融冰才向海洋流去，两岸的积雪才从河岸的斜坡向下滑。在阳光整昼夜的照耀下，冻土地上长出了嫩绿的青草。一丛丛灰色的赤杨和柳树扬花吐絮，在未融化的冰块和雪堆之间，隐隐约约可以看见淡红色的草莓、醋粟和天蓝色的玻璃草。一阵蒙蒙的温雨过后，整个冻土地带上都开满了白色的雏菊花。
    在这春光明媚的季节，叶尼塞河畔的列维沙村最快乐的人是渔民。在渔场上，歌声和嬉乐之声从不停息，特别是当渔民们结队出海捕鱼的时候。渔夫从船上撒下长达半公里的大鱼网，然后再用电动机器把它拖上来。每天，都要从这里把几千公斤的鲑鱼、鳟鱼、鲟鱼等送到工厂去加工。
    从前，人们都认为在北极圈内进行耕作是不能实现的梦想。可是，现在人征服了自然。
    这里的集体农庄用温床栽种番茄、甘蓝、蔓菁和萝卜。而在6月底，当土地开始解冻和温暖的时候，人们就在露天里种东西。到了秋天，集体农庄就可以收获长得很好的蔬菜、萝卜和马铃薯。
    傍晚，一大群牛闹轰轰地进了村子，全村很快就传出了鲜牛奶的香味。在这边远地区，不久以前人们还只能喝到罐头牛奶，现在集体农庄庄员已经可以从自己饲养的每头奶牛身上一年挤到约四千公升牛奶。
    从古以来，这里就是盛产野味的地方。列维沙村的人有一套打猎的办法。秋天猎人在河岸附近捕获北极狐，用笼子把它们关到冬天直到狐皮长好的时候。这里的人们吃鹿肉，穿鹿皮，用鹿拖车。养鹿的人用几根柱子撑着鹿皮和帆布，搭成了所谓“巴洛克”的白色小屋，旧式的烟雾弥漫的帐幕已经不存在了。在劳动以后，“巴洛克”始终是挤满学习的人。
