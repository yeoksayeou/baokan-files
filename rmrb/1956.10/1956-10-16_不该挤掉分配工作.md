	It's Wrong to Squeeze Out Distribution Work
	Nan Mu
	The autumn harvest has generally begun, but some agricultural cooperatives have yet to distribute the summer grain to their members. Liangtian Township's Thirteenth Cooperative in Ruichang County, Jiangxi Province, has only pre-distributed over 28,000 jin of rice to its members, with over 41,000 jin still stockpiled and not distributed. The Eighth Cooperative in Beishan Township, Duchang County, delayed distribution, resulting in over 1,500 jin of rice becoming moldy. It is said that the reason for the lack of distribution is due to some difficulties encountered. For example, during the busy summer harvest and planting season, production had to be prioritized, so the summer harvest distribution work was put on hold. After the summer harvest, before people could catch their breath, the establishment of advanced cooperatives began. Cooperative cadres and work teams were busy with meetings, large and small, preparing plans and drafting proposals. Accountants were busy copying and writing, and had no time to sort out old accounts. Members clamored for grain distribution, but cadres shouted for the establishment of cooperatives, because establishing cooperatives was a crash campaign that could not be delayed; the distribution date was still far off, so it was put on hold again. Although production and the establishment of cooperatives are both very important, is it acceptable not to distribute grain when it should be distributed? No, it is not. If you don't believe it, look at the facts.
	When Desheng Township in Duchang County was transitioning to advanced cooperatives, meetings were held every day to talk about the benefits of advanced cooperatives, but because the grain had not been properly distributed, the masses were skeptical. Some members said, "We've been working in elementary cooperatives for a year, and we don't even know what's going on, and now we're blindly transitioning to advanced cooperatives." Many farmers outside the cooperative were hesitant to join.
	Let's look at Liangtian Township's Thirteenth Cooperative. On the morning of September 12, the county committee's inspection team arrived and saw a field of white cotton, but no one was picking it; the late rice fields were dry and cracked, with only three or four people scattered in the fields. Entering the village, women were making noodles, grinding grain, husking rice, and making shoes, while men were chatting idly on the threshing ground in groups of twos and threes. The comrades of the inspection team went up to chat with them, and an old man revealed the truth, saying, "Feet in the mud, hands in the mud, busy for half a year and haven't seen any benefits, it's really disheartening."
	The above facts clearly illustrate this principle: Only through distribution can the superiority of the cooperative be recognized by the vast majority of farmers, and can the enthusiasm of members for labor production be stimulated. Squeezing out distribution work is not right.

    不该挤掉分配工作
    南木
    秋收已经普遍开始了，但是有一些农业社的夏粮还没有分到社员手里。江西瑞昌县良田乡十三社到现在只预支给社员二万八千多斤稻谷，尚积压四万一千多斤没有分配下去。都昌县北山乡第八社拖延不分，稻谷已霉烂一千五百多斤。据说，所以没分是因为碰到了一些困难。如当时夏收夏种紧张，生产要赶火候，因而将夏收分配工作搁下了。夏收一过，没等喘过气来，又接上建高级社，社干部和工作组又忙做一团，天天大会小会，编计划、订方案，会计忙于抄抄写写，也顾不及整理旧账。社员吵着分粮，干部却大喊建社，因为建社是突击性运动，耽误不得；分配日子还长，因而又被搁住了。生产、建社工作虽然都很重要，但应当分粮食的时候不分粮行不行呢？不行。如不相信，请看事实。
    都昌县得胜乡在转高级社时，天天开会讲高级社的好处，但由于粮食没有分配好，群众都将信将疑，有的社员说：“搞了一年初级社，连底都摸不清，又蒙着头转高级社了。”许多社外农民对入社拿不定主意。
    再看良田乡十三社吧。9月12日上午，县委检查组来到这里，只见棉地一片雪白，却无人捡花；晚稻田里干得裂缝，而田里稀稀落落只有三、四个人。进入村里，妇女在做面、推谷、舂米、做鞋，男的三三两两在禾场上闲谈。检查组的同志凑上去拉话，一个老汉就道出了根底，他说：“脚插泥，手插泥，忙了半年还没见收益，真叫人心冷。”
    以上事实，已经很清楚地说明了这个道理：只有通过分配，合作社的优越性才能为广大农民所公认，才能激发社员积极劳动生产。挤掉分配工作是不应该的。
