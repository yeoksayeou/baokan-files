Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 30th. Soviet scientist Balabanov recently published an article in "Red Star" stating: The era in which humans can create their own solar energy on Earth has arrived. Solar energy can be created by practically utilizing the energy released from thermonuclear reactions.

Balabanov said when talking about artificial suns, the difficulty in solving this problem lies first in the fact that, in order for thermonuclear reactions to begin, extremely high temperatures must be created, and materials must be selected for the container that can withstand ultra-high temperatures and ultra-high pressures and can resist particles scattering at high speeds.

The article then pointed out that Soviet scientists believe that an electromagnetic container can be used to create a small artificial sun. Because, under ultra-high temperature conditions, thermonuclear fuel is no longer composed of ordinary atoms, but of charged particles such as ions and electrons. Ions and electrons can be blocked by strong magnetic and electric fields. In this way, it is possible to create a special electromagnetic container to hold thermonuclear fuel with temperatures as high as several million degrees. It is said that fast charged particles are almost impossible to fly out of here. Moreover, these fast particles formed during the thermonuclear reaction collide with other particles of the thermonuclear fuel, which can maintain the high temperature and transfer energy to the surrounding areas. If slow combustion of light nuclei can be achieved, then an electromagnetic container with an ultra-high temperature environment capable of carrying out thermonuclear reactions will become a small artificial sun on Earth.

    苏联科学家巴拉巴诺夫说人类能造小型太阳
    新华社莫斯科30日电苏联科学家巴拉巴诺夫最近在“红星报”上发表文章 说：人类在地球上制造自己的太阳能的时代，已经到来了。实际利用热核子反应放出的能，就可以造成太阳能。
    巴拉巴诺夫在谈到人造太阳时说，解决这个问题的困难首先在于，要使热核子反应开始，必须造成非常高的温度，还要选择能够经受超高温和超高压并且能抵御以高速度飞散开来的粒子的材料作容器。
    文章接着指出，苏联科学家认为可以用一种电磁容器来制造小型人造太阳。因为，在超高温的条件下，热核子燃料已经不是由普通原子组成，而是由离子和电子这些带电的粒子组成。而离子和电子可以用强大的磁场和电场拦住。这样，就有可能造成特别的电磁容器：来盛置具有高达数百万度温度的热核子燃料。据说，快速带电粒子是几乎无法从这里飞出去的。而且，在热核子反应过程中形成的这些快速粒子同热核子燃料的其他粒子发生碰撞，可以维持其中的高温，把能量传给周围地区。如果可以造成轻核子的缓慢燃烧，那么具有可以进行热核子反应的超高温环境的电磁容器就将成为地球上的小型人造太阳了。
