Xinhua News Agency, October 15th: The "Sunday Times" published an article by Richard Hughes from Hong Kong, saying: British military authorities privately agree that government officials' handling of the lingering and brutal riots in this colony is inappropriate and clumsy. The report stated that if more resolute and swift action had been taken, the riots could have been stopped on Wednesday night.

The report then said that the responsibility for the riots must not be attributed to the Communists.

    “星期日泰晤士报”说：
    香港当局对九龙骚动采取姑息态度
    据新华社15日讯“星期日泰晤士报”刊登了理查德·希吉斯从香港发出的文章说：英国军事当局私下里表示同意，政府官员处理这个殖民地发生的迟迟不得平息的残暴的骚动的做法是很不应当和拙劣。这篇报道说，假如是较为坚定而迅速地采取行动，那末骚动本来是可以在星期三晚上制止住的。
    这篇报道接着说，决不能把骚乱的责任归在共产党党人的头上。
