A total of nine hundred people attended the public memorial ceremony.

As the public memorial ceremony began, the band played funeral music. The presiding officer, Zhou Enlai, presented a wreath to Comrade Peng Zemin's coffin.

Li Weihan, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, delivered a eulogy. He said that the passing of Mr. Peng Zemin is a loss to us. Mr. Peng Zemin lived in Malaya in his early years and, responding to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's call, joined the Tongmenghui locally. After the Revolution of 1911, he successively participated in the Kuomintang, the Chinese Revolutionary Party, and the Chinese Kuomintang, which were organized by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Mr. Peng Zemin returned to China in 1926. When he saw that Chiang Kai-shek was usurping the fruits of the people's revolution, surrendering to imperialism, and suppressing the people's revolution, he resolutely participated in the "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising, and later followed the revolutionary army back to Guangdong. Mr. Peng's patriotic actions were hated by the reactionary forces at the time, and he was eventually expelled from the Kuomintang and spent more than 20 years in political exile in Hong Kong. He continued to engage in anti-imperialist patriotic activities in Hong Kong. He and Mr. Deng Yanda, Mr. Zhang Bojun, and others jointly organized the Peasants and Workers Democratic Party and remained in Hong Kong to be responsible for party affairs. He also participated in the "People's Government" established in Fujian by the generals of the 19th Route Army, and tried his best to oppose the traitorous civil war, advocating cooperation with the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. Later, he joined the China Democratic League and participated in the leadership of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League.

Li Weihan continued, after the founding of the People's Republic of China, Mr. Peng also held many important positions. Together with the people of the motherland, he worked hard for the cause of socialist construction.

Li Weihan said that the road Mr. Peng Zemin has traveled throughout his life reflects the road traveled by patriotic overseas Chinese, and his wishes are also the wishes of patriotic overseas Chinese. His consistent patriotic spirit has become a model for patriotic overseas Chinese.

Zhang Bojun, Chairman of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, introduced the anti-imperialist and patriotic deeds of Comrade Peng Zemin from his early years living in Malaya until after the founding of the People's Republic of China at the public memorial ceremony. He said: "After the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, Comrade Zemin worked hard for the socialist transformation and socialist construction of the motherland with an excited and joyful spirit and a diligent service attitude. He treated people sincerely and modestly and lived a simple life. Although he was old, he was still eager to learn. He also went to Germany to participate in the World Peace Council meeting, participated in visits to Henan and Anhui to express sympathy for the disaster situation, visits to fraternal ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, and investigations into the crimes of American imperialism spreading bacteria in the Northeast."

After Zhang Bojun's speech, the coffin was lifted. Zhou Enlai, Premier, and other participants in the public memorial service held the ropes.

At 12:00 noon, Comrade Peng Zemin's remains were buried in the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery. (Attached picture)

    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李维汉致悼词。他说，彭泽民先生的逝世是我们的一个损失。彭泽民先生早年侨居马来亚，响应孙中山先生的主张，在当地参加了同盟会；辛亥革命以后，先后参加了孙中山先生所组织的国民党、中华革命党和中国国民党。彭泽民先生在1926年回国。当他看清了当时蒋介石篡夺人民革命果实并向帝国主义投降，镇压人民革命的时候，就毅然参加了“八一”南昌起义，以后又追随革命军回到广东。彭先生的爱国行动，为当时的反动势力所仇视，终至被开除国民党党籍，后到香港度过了二十余年的政治流亡生活。他在香港仍进行反帝爱国活动。他曾与邓演达、章伯钧诸先生共同组织农工民主党，留在香港负责党务。他还参与十九路军各将领在福建成立的“人民政府”，竭力反对卖国内战，主张与中国工农红军合作。以后他又参加中国民主同盟并参与民盟中央的领导工作。
    李维汉接着说，在中华人民共和国成立以后，彭先生还担任了许多重要职务。他和祖国人民一起，共同为社会主义的建设事业而努力。
    李维汉说，彭泽民先生一生所走的道路，反映了爱国华侨所走的道路，他的愿望也就是爱国华侨的愿望，他始终如一的爱国精神，成为爱国华侨的一个榜样。
    中国农工民主党主席章伯钧在公祭大会上介绍了彭泽民委员早年侨居马来亚一直到中华人民共和国成立后一生的反帝爱国事迹。他说：“中华人民共和国成立后，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，泽民同志以兴奋愉快的精神和勤恳的服务态度，为祖国的社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业而努力。他待人诚恳、谦虚，生活朴素。他虽然年事已高，仍然好学不倦。他还曾赴德国参加世界和平理事会会议，参加河南、安徽灾情慰问、内蒙古兄弟民族慰问和东北美帝国主义散发细菌罪行调查等工作。”
    章伯钧讲话后，开始起灵。执绋的有周恩来总理和其他参加公祭的人员。
    中午十二时，彭泽民委员遗体在八宝山革命公墓安葬。（附图片）
