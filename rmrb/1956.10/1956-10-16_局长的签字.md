A small scene:

    The Bureau Chief's Signature
    A staff member took a letter of introduction for going to the factory and presented it to the bureau chief. The bureau chief picked up his "51" pen and scribbled three characters. The staff member took it to get the official seal.

    "Bureau Chief, what did you just sign?" A colleague sitting next to him asked with a smile.

    "Signed the letter of introduction, of course!" the bureau chief replied confidently.

    "To which unit? To investigate what?"

    "Oh!..." The bureau chief felt a little regretful, but then he retorted with perfect assurance:

    "Hey! Isn't the section chief's signature on the right?"　Wang Mang

    局长的签字
    一位科员拿着下厂的介绍信送到局长的面前，局长拿起“51”笔刷刷地签了三个字，科员拿去盖公章去了。
    “局长，你刚才签的是什么？”坐在旁边的一位同志笑嘻嘻地问道。
    “签的是介绍信呀！”局长自信地回答。
    “到哪个单位？去了解什么？”
    “呵！……”局长感到有点遗憾，但却又振振有词地答道：
    “嗳！右边不是有科长签过字嘛！”　汪茫
