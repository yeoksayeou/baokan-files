Basketball Selection Tournament Concludes
Joint Team Defeats Shenyang Military Region to Win Championship

(Our Dispatch) The final two matches of the basketball selection tournament took place last night. The Joint Team defeated the Shenyang Military Region team with a score of 101-84, winning the championship. The Shenyang Military Region team secured second place with a record of three wins and one loss. In another match between Hong Kong and Macau, the Hong Kong team defeated the Macau team with a score of 93-64, securing seventh place, while the Macau team finished eighth.

The game between the Joint Team and the Shenyang Military Region team was intense throughout.

At the beginning of the match, both sides adopted a fast-paced offense. The Joint Team, exploiting the Shenyang Military Region team's weak center defense and shorter guards, used Liu Erzhu and Wang Lifa as dual centers, weaving around the basket. After receiving the ball, they immediately jumped and turned to shoot, quickly taking an 11-6 lead, ahead by five points. The Shenyang Military Region team, after each possession, rapidly organized fast breaks. With a few passes, the ball was already under the basket. Guan Weijun and Ma Qingsheng repeatedly cut into the basket, bringing the score to 21-24. At this point, both sides engaged in fierce battles for rebounds under the basket in order to secure fast breaks. Each time players jumped to compete for rebounds, there were more than four or five people involved. Around the ten-minute mark, the Joint Team's perimeter coordination and fast breaks proved very successful. Yang Boyong repeatedly cut in to score, and Qian Chenghai, with Zhang Xishan's cross-screen, jumped and shot continuously, gradually increasing the lead. After the Shenyang Military Region team called a timeout, they narrowed their defensive zone. At the same time, Guan Weijun's fast-break steals and Ma Qingsheng's feints past the defense for quick layups were both successful, leading to a tense situation of 32-32 and 35-35. The score at the end of the first half was 41-37, with the Joint Team in the lead.

During the half-time break, both teams' locker rooms were packed with players, listening to their coaches' plans for the second half. The tension outside the court was no less intense than on the court. The Joint Team had a four-point lead in the first half, but the lead was very unstable. Therefore, coach Chen Wenbin instructed the players to shoot as much as possible in the second half when they had the opportunity, and to avoid individual "heroics" and cooperate well in offense. The Shenyang Military Region team's fast-break prowess had already played a significant role in the first half, but coach Lan Wenzhi believed that the attacks were "not aggressive enough." He said, "Whoever can successfully execute high-speed fast breaks in the second half will win this game."

At the beginning of the second half, Zhang Xishan, Qian Chenghai, and Yang Boyong of the Joint Team coordinated fast breaks from the left, center, and right, scoring continuously and raising the score to 53-40. At this point, the Shenyang Military Region team requested a timeout and strengthened their collective defense before resuming play. Guan Weijun of the Shenyang Military Region team exploited Yang Boyong of the Joint Team's weak defensive ability, twice faking him out and dribbling to the basket for a score. Later, they used a half-court man-to-man defense, which disrupted the opponent's lineup for a time, closing the gap to 68-62, just six points behind. At this time, Liu Erzhu and Yang Boyong of the Joint Team were both sent off after committing five fouls each, but the Joint Team's strength was not affected. The substitutes, Wang Zhaoyu and Bai Jinshen, were also good at fast breaks. In the last ten minutes of the game, the Shenyang Military Region team did play with the "aggressiveness" required by their coach. Ma Qingsheng was able to grab rebounds in the backcourt and coordinate Hu Songfa's fast breaks in the frontcourt, making continuous contributions. The Joint Team, at this time, tried to shoot only when they were confident of scoring, maintaining a lead of more than ten points throughout. With sixteen seconds left in the game, Bai Jinshen scored two more free throws, and the Joint Team finally defeated their strong opponent, the Shenyang Military Region team, with a score of 101-84, winning the championship in this selection tournament.

    篮球选拔赛结束
    联队胜沈阳部队获得冠军
    本报讯　昨天晚上，篮球选拔赛的最后两场比赛中，联队以一百零一比八十四胜沈阳部队队，获得了冠军。沈阳部队队以三胜一败的成绩获得了亚军。另一场香港对澳门的比赛，香港队以九十三比六十四胜澳门队，取得了第七名，澳门队取得第八名。
    联队和沈阳部队队之战，整场比赛都十分紧张。
    比赛开始，双方都采用了快速进攻，联队利用沈阳部队队中锋防守不强和后卫个子不高，由刘二柱、王利发打双中锋，穿梭般地在篮下活动，得球后，即跳起转身投篮，不久即打成了十一比六，占先五分。沈阳部队队在每次得球后，即迅速组织快攻，几下传递，球已攻至篮下，关维均、马清盛接连篮下切入，比分追成二十一比二十四。这时候双方为了争取快攻，展开了激烈的篮下球的争夺，每次跳起争夺篮下球的队员都在四、五人以上。在比赛到十分钟左右时，联队外围配合和快速突破打得很成功，杨伯镛接连切入得分，钱澄海在张锡山交叉掩护下，跃起投篮也连续得分，得分逐渐超出较多。沈阳部队队叫停后，缩小防守区域；同时关维均的快攻偷袭，马清盛的假动作晃过对方防守快速上篮都很成功，场上出现了三十二平、三十五平的紧张局面。上半时结束时比分是四十一比三十七，联队占先。
    在中场休息的时候，两队运动员的休息室内都挤满了队员，倾听两队的指导部署下半场的作战计划，场外双方活动的紧张程度丝毫不亚于场内。联队上半场领先四分，但是领先的局面极不稳定，因此指导陈文彬布置队员们在下半场有机会就尽量投篮，同时避免一个人“单干”，要很好地互相配合进攻。沈阳部队队上半场快攻的威力已经发挥出很大作用，但是指导蓝文治认为突击得“还不够狠”，他说：“下半场谁能打成功高速度的快攻，谁就会赢得这场比赛的胜利。”
    下半场刚开始，联队张锡山、钱澄海和杨伯镛三人便从左、中、右三路配合接连快攻得分，比分上升到五十三比四十。这时沈阳部队队要求暂停，加强集体防守力量后再战。沈阳部队队关维均，利用联队杨伯镛防守能力差的弱点，两次晃过他带球上篮得分。以后又利用半场人盯人的打法，曾一度打乱了对方的阵容，追到六十八比六十二，只剩六分之差。这时联队刘二柱和杨伯镛相继五次犯规被罚下，但是联队的实力并未因此受到影响，换上场的队员王兆钰、白金申等也都是打快攻的好手。沈阳部队队在终场前十分钟的时候确实打出他们指导要求的“狠”的程度，马清盛又能抢后场篮板球，又能配合胡松发的前场快攻，不断立功。联队这时尽量争取在有把握投中的时候投篮，始终保住领先十多分的局面。在终场前十六秒钟的时候，白金申又罚进两个球，联队终以一百零一比八十四战胜劲敌沈阳部队队，夺得这次选拔赛的冠军。（附图片）
