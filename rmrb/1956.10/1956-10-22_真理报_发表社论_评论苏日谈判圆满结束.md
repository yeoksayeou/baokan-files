Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 21st: "Pravda" today published an editorial entitled "Successful Conclusion of Soviet-Japanese Negotiations," stating that the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Japan would eliminate Japan's artificial isolation, an isolation that certain foreign groups have been trying to prevent Japan from restoring its traditional economic and cultural relations with its neighboring countries. The normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations will undoubtedly promote Japan's true national independence and help strengthen its international position.
	The editorial said that the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration and the Protocol between the Soviet Union and Japan on the Development of Trade and Mutual Most-Favored-Nation Treatment are the rich results of the great work carried out by the Soviet Union and Japan during the negotiations held in Moscow from October 13 to 19. The provisions in the Joint Declaration mark the beginning of a new stage in Soviet-Japanese relations—relations based on equality, good neighborliness, and mutual benefit.
	The editorial pointed out that the situation in the Far East today has undergone fundamental changes. The Chinese people have established their own country—the great People's Republic of China. The fraternal alliance between the Soviet Union and the Chinese people has become the most important factor in international relations. The "Bandung Spirit" is increasingly permeating the relations between most countries in Asia and Africa. In such a situation, Japan cannot deviate from the path pointed to by the historical milestones. Clear-minded people in Japan understand very well that their country should not retreat, but should advance along the road to peace, which was clearly stipulated in the resolutions of the Bandung Conference, in which Japan also participated.

    “真理报”发表社论
    评论苏日谈判圆满结束
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”今天发表了一篇题为
  “苏日谈判圆满结束”的社论说，苏日正常外交关系的恢复，会消除日本的人为的孤立，这一种孤立是某些外国集团竭力阻挠日本同各邻国恢复传统的经济文化关系的结果。苏日关系的正常化，毫无疑问，将促进日本的真正的民族独立，有助于加强它的国际地位。
    社论说，苏日联合宣言和苏日之间关于发展贸易和互相给予最惠国待遇的议定书是苏日两国从10月13日到19日在莫斯科举行谈判期间所进行的巨大工作的丰富成果。联合宣言中的规定标志着苏日关系——以平等、睦邻和互利为基础的关系开始进入新的阶段。
    社论指出，今天的远东局势已经起了根本的变化，中国人民建立了自己的国家——伟大的中华人民共和国，苏联和中国人民之间的兄弟同盟已经成了国际关系中的最重要的因素，“万隆精神”日渐弥漫于亚洲和非洲大多数国家的关系之中。在这样一种局势中，日本不能离开历史里程碑所指向的大道。日本的思想清醒的人非常懂得他们的国家不应该后退，而应该沿着日本也曾参加的万隆会议的决议所明确规定的和平道路前进。
