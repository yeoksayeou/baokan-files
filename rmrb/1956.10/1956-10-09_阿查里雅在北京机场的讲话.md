　　Acharya's Speech at Beijing Airport

　　Your Excellency, Friends!
    Parting is never a pleasant thing, especially saying goodbye to such hospitable and kind friends like the Chinese people. My stay here has been short, but the deep love and sincere friendship that you have shown to me and the Nepalese people during my visit has made me feel as if I am parting with old friends of many years.
    However, friends, parting is only for the next meeting, and the ever-growing friendship between our two countries, Nepal and China, will continue to provide us with more opportunities to meet. In this pleasant atmosphere, I express my heartfelt gratitude for your hospitality and tell you that we will always remember this short but intimate contact with our Chinese friends. Finally, I do not say goodbye to you, but only say "goodbye for now," because I confidently look forward to meeting you again.
    Long live Nepalese-Chinese friendship!

　　阿查里雅在北京机场的讲话
　　阁下，朋友们！
    离别从来不是一件愉快的事情，尤其是同中国人民这样好客和善意的朋友们的告别。我在你们这里逗留的时间是很短的，但是你们在我的访问期间向我和尼泊尔人民表示的深刻的友爱和诚挚的友谊，使我感到好像我正在同数年的亲密的老朋友分别一样。
    但是，朋友们离别只是为了下次再见，而我们尼、中两国不断增长着的友谊将继续给我们提供更多的机会来会面。在这种愉快的气氛中，我对你们给我的款待表示衷心的感谢，并告诉你们，我们将永远记住这次同我们中国朋友们的短的但是亲密的接触。最后，我不同你们告别，只说“再见”，因为我怀着信心期望同你们再次见面。
    尼、中友好万岁！
