    Save Historical Materials of Agricultural Cooperatives
    Recently, we conducted investigations in the Liaoyuan, Xingfu, Hongxing, and Fanrong agricultural cooperatives in Jieyu County, Shanxi, and found that the original materials of these cooperatives were very disorganized, and some valuable materials were missing.
    How did these materials get lost? On the one hand, the cooperatives lacked a materials management system, as they said, "Experiences and summaries are flying all over the place"; on the other hand, some visiting groups and delegations took them away for their own convenience after reading them. For example, many copies of the Liaoyuan cooperative's charter were originally printed, but we had a lot of trouble finding even one this time.
    The original materials of agricultural cooperatives are very important for our research on the development history of the cooperative movement and should be managed in a planned way. I suggest that the local Party committee help agricultural cooperatives, especially key cooperatives, establish a set of materials management system, and that lending should also have certain procedures.

    保存农业社的历史资料
    日前我们到山西解虞县燎原、幸福、红星、繁荣等农业社作调查，发现这些社的原始资料十分混乱，有些很宝贵的材料找不见了。
    这些材料怎么会遗失了呢？一方面是合作社没有资料保管制度，正如他们所说的“经验、总结满天飞”；另一方面是有些参观团、访问团的人们，为了自己方便，看完就拿走了。如燎原社的社章原来印了很多，这次我们费很大劲才找到一本。
    农业社的原始资料对于我们研究合作化运动的发展历史，是很重要的，应当有计划地加以管理，我建议当地党委帮助农业社特别是重点社，建立起一套资料保管制度，出借也要有一定的手续。　孙兆漋
