    West German Workers Oppose Militarism
    -- A Record of the Fourth Congress of the West German Trade Union Confederation (Hamburg)
    He Jiang
    The Fourth Congress of the West German Trade Union Confederation, held this month in Hamburg, has a profound impact on the struggle of the West German working class and the development of the West German political situation, especially on the West German parliamentary elections next year. Because the West German Trade Union Confederation is the largest mass organization in West Germany, it has one-third of the total employed population in West Germany or two-thirds of the organized workers in West Germany. Trade union members are the main base of the seven or eight million voters of the West German Social Democratic Party.
    In order to win the votes of union members, Adenauer, ignoring the taboo of interfering in union affairs, delivered a speech at the conference in his capacity as Chancellor. Such a move by the head of government is unprecedented in West Germany. In his speech, Adenauer made no mention of the rearmament and conscription issues that West German workers are most concerned about.
    Despite Adenauer's direct interference in union affairs and the pro-American group's wooing and buying off of union leaders, the conference still passed a resolution against rearmament.

    Demanding the Abolition of Conscription
    The main feature of the Hamburg Congress was the victory of the forces opposing remilitarization. The conference's resolution against rearmament was more specific than the resolution against West German armament passed at the Third Congress held in Frankfurt two years ago. This resolution called for the abolition of rearmament, the abolition of conscription laws, and the union's support for all forces opposing rearmament. The conference also passed a resolution reaffirming the right of every citizen to refuse military service.
    The passage of these resolutions formed the climax of the entire conference discussion process. A large majority of the delegates and a very small number of delegates instructed to oppose (part of the Christian trade union members) engaged in fierce debate. The representatives of this insignificant minority did not hesitate to use screams, table banging, and jumping up to interrupt other people's speeches to prevent the passage of the resolution. Even so, out of more than 400 delegates, only 20 voted against the resolution on opposition to rearmament, and the other delegates voted in favor. It is particularly noteworthy that 70 of the delegates were members of Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union, including 30 members of the West German Christian Trade Union, but there were only 20 dissenting votes. This shows that there are many people within the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Trade Union who oppose the Adenauer group's policy of remilitarizing West Germany.

    The Bonn government figures expressed "surprise" at the results of the Hamburg Congress. Many of these figures also publicly expressed "regret" over the union's resolution, believing that the union was "interfering" in the affairs of the parliament and the government, and they insisted that the masses of people and the union should not interfere in the issue of conscription. The Adenauer group's newspapers even used an angry tone to accuse the union of "violating the union's neutrality and not interfering in decision-making" tradition.

    The Concerns and Sentiments of the Masses
    It can be seen from this congress that West German workers are increasingly concerned about political issues, especially the issue of German reunification and the issue of West German rearmament. This phenomenon can be said to be another important feature of the congress.
    Of the approximately 400 proposals submitted at the conference, one-quarter were completely political; proposals directly or indirectly related to political issues accounted for half of the total proposals.

    The conference's resolution on the "Declaration of Unification" was unanimously approved by all the delegates. The resolution instructed the National Council of the Trade Union Confederation to establish a "Unification Issue Committee" to submit a plan for German unification before May 1, 1957.

    The Words and Deeds of Union Leaders
    As in the past, this congress still showed the tendency of right-wing union leaders to compromise. The vague wording of the conference resolutions left "back doors" to provide them with excuses for not effectively implementing the resolutions.
    For example, the resolution on the abolition of conscription mentioned the need to support forces that adopt "democratic methods." Many people inside and outside the conference openly believed that the meaning of "democratic methods" was too vague. Another example is that the "German Unification Declaration" did not mention the unified action of Social Democratic workers and Communist workers at all, and did not mention the negotiation between West Germany and Democratic Germany. The suggestion of the West German National Printing and Paper Industry Union (one of the sixteen national industrial unions participating in the West German Trade Union Confederation) to establish contact with the Democratic German Trade Union Federation was also blocked by the right-wing union leaders and failed to pass. Other ambiguous wording and tendencies were also manifested in resolutions on the forty-hour work week, pension reform, improvement of workers' lives, automation and atomic energy, and co-determination.

    The compromising attitude of the West German right-wing union leaders is due to a reason. There are countless connections between them and the capitalists. The highest income of union leaders reaches more than 10,000 US dollars per month, far exceeding the monthly salary of ordinary ministers of the West German government. Capitalists often take the opportunity of union leaders' birthdays and vacations to give them cars, televisions, and electric refrigerators as gifts. This method of bribery has a certain effect. In addition, union leaders are the actual holders of many industrial and commercial enterprises and financial enterprises affiliated with the West German Trade Union Confederation. The West German Trade Union has six affiliated banks, and their total assets reach 1.38 billion marks (approximately 330 million US dollars). In addition, many union leaders serve as supervisors of many important enterprises in West Germany (receiving generous salaries). Their lives are luxurious and corrupt. At the request of the delegates, the Hamburg Congress passed a resolution prohibiting holding more than two supervisory positions in order to limit the union leaders.

    The West German working masses are dissatisfied with the actions of union leaders that violate the interests of the working class. This dissatisfaction can be proved by many facts. Six of the nine executive directors of the West German Trade Union Confederation were replaced this time, and Chairman Freitag was also replaced by the new Chairman Richter. More than half of the delegates to the Third Congress were full-time union cadres, but the proportion of such cadres in this congress has dropped to 42%; this shows the declining trend of the prestige of right-wing union cadres among the masses in the past two years. In the past year or two, the number of employed people in West Germany has increased by nearly one million, but the number of members of the West German Trade Union Confederation has not increased, and remains at the level of 6.1 million. What is particularly serious is that very few young workers join the union.

    In the current situation where the crisis of West German remilitarization is becoming increasingly serious, West German workers eagerly hope to obtain firm leadership in their struggle for unity and against rearmament.

    西德工人反对军国主义
    ——记西德工会联合会第四次代表大会（汉堡）
    何疆
    西德工会联合会本月在汉堡召开的第四次代表大会，对于西德工人阶级的斗争和西德政局的发展，尤其对于明年西德议会的选举，都有深刻的影响。因为西德工会联合会是西德最大的群众团体，它拥有西德就业总人数的三分之一或西德有组织的职工的三分之二。工会会员是西德社会民主党七、八百万选民的主要基础。
    为了骗取工会会员的选票，阿登纳居然也不顾干涉工会事务的忌讳，而以总理身份在这次大会上发表演讲。政府首脑的这种举动，还是西德空前未有的事。阿登纳在讲话中，对于目前西德工人最关心的重新武装和兵役问题，只字不提。
    尽管有阿登纳对工会事务的直接干涉和亲美集团对工会领袖的拉拢和收买，这次代表大会依然通过了关于反对重新武装的决议。
    要求废除兵役制
    汉堡代表大会的主要特点，就是反对重新军国主义化的力量的胜利。这次大会关于反对重新武装的决议，比两年前在法兰克福举行的第三次代表大会关于反对西德武装的决议规定得更具体些。这次的决议中要求取消再武装、废除兵役法、工会支持反对重新武装的一切力量。大会同时还通过一个决议，重申每个公民有权拒绝服兵役。
    这些决议的通过，形成了整个大会讨论进程中的最高峰。压倒多数的代表和极少数的被授意来进行反对的代表（基督教工会派成员的一部分）之间展开剧烈的争论。这个微不足道的少数派的代表不惜用怪声喊叫、大拍桌子、跳起来打断别人发言等手段来阻止决议的通过。虽然如此，在四百多名代表里，除了二十名投反对票外，其他代表都投票赞成关于反对重新武装的决议。特别值得注意的是：代表里有七十名是阿登纳的基督教民主联盟的党员，其中有三十名西德基督教工会派的成员，但只有二十张反对票。这说明在基督教民主联盟内部和基督教工会派内部都有不少人反对阿登纳集团的使西德重新军国主义化的政策。
    波恩政府人物对汉堡代表大会的结果表示“惊讶”。这些人物里有不少人还公开地对工会的决议表示“遗憾”，认为工会“干涉”议会和政府的事务，他们硬说人民群众和工会是不能过问兵役问题。阿登纳集团的报纸甚至用恼怒的口气来责骂工会“违反工会中立、不干与决策”的传统。
    群众的关心和情绪
    在这次代表大会上可以看出，西德工人愈来愈关心政治问题，尤其是德国统一问题和西德重新武装问题。这种现象可以说是大会的另一个重要特点。
    大会上所提出的大约四百件提案中，有四分之一是完全政治性的；与政治问题直接或间接有关的提案则占到提案总数的半数。
    大会关于“统一宣言”的决议是全体代表一致投票通过的。决议责成工会联合会全国理事会设立“统一问题委员会”，在1957年5月1日之前提出关于德国统一的方案。
    工会领袖的言行
    和以往的情形相仿，这次大会仍表现出右翼工会领袖的妥协主义倾向。大会决议的含糊的措词里都留着“后门”，给他们提供不切实执行决议的借口。
    譬如关于废除兵役制的决议里提到要支持采取“民主方式”的力量。会里和会外有许多人都公开认为“民主方式”的含义太模糊。又譬如“德国统一宣言”里居然根本不提社会民主党工人和共产党工人的统一行动问题，根本不提西德和民主德国之间的谈判问题。西德全国印刷业和纸张业工会（参加西德工会联合会的十六个全国性产业工会之一）关于同民主德国总工会建立联系的建议，也由于右翼工会领袖的阻挠而未能通过。其他在关于四十小时工作周问题、养老金改革问题、改善职工生活问题、自动化和原子能问题、共同决定权问题等各项决议中也都表现出这种模棱两可的措词和倾向。
    西德右翼工会领袖的妥协态度是有原因的。他们与资本家之间有着千丝万缕的联系。工会领袖中的最高收入达到每月一万美元以上，远远超过西德政府一般的部长的月薪。资本家常常乘工会领袖的寿辰和度假等机会把汽车、电视机和电气冰箱等作为礼物赠送给他们。这种收买手段是获得一定效果的。此外，工会领袖是西德工会联合会所属许多工商企业和金融企业的实际握有者。西德工会附设六家银行，他们的资产总额达到十三亿八千万马克（约三亿三千万美元）。另外，不少工会领袖担任西德许多重要企业的监事（领取优厚的薪金）。他们的生活是奢华和腐化的。这次汉堡代表大会在代表们的要求下，通过了关于不得担任两个以上的监事职务的决议，以便对工会领袖有所限制。
    西德工人群众对于工会领袖的违反工人阶级利益的行动是不满的。这种不满可以用好多件事实来证明。西德工会联合会的九名常务理事中这次被撤换了六名，主席福莱塔格也被新任主席里希特来替代。第三次代表大会的代表里有过半数以上是专职工会干部，而这次大会的代表里这种干部所占的比数则降至42％；这说明两年里右翼工会干部在群众中的威信的下降趋势。近一两年来，西德就业人数增加了将近一百万，但西德工会联合会会员人数却并没有增加，仍停留于六百一十万人的水平。尤其严重的是：青年工人参加工会的极少。
    在目前西德重新军国主义化的危机日益严重的形势下，西德工人殷切地期望在他们争取统一和反对重新武装的斗争中获得坚决的领导。
