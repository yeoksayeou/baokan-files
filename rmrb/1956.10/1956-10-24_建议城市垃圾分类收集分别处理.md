    Suggestion for Separate Collection and Treatment of Urban Waste
    In recent years, due to the continuous increase in urban population, urban waste has also increased year by year. For example, in Beijing, the accumulated amount of waste in 1950 was approximately 550,000 cubic meters (approximately 70 kilograms per cubic meter), while in 1955 it reached 950,000 cubic meters.
    Garbage contains a certain amount of fertilizer. According to Shanghai's tests: fresh garbage contains 0.54% nitrogen, 0.304% phosphorus, and 33% organic matter; Tianjin's tests show that pure organic garbage contains up to 1% nitrogen. Calculated at a nitrogen content of 0.54%, twelve catties of fresh garbage has the fertilizer effect of one catty of soybean cake. According to statistics, ten cities including Xi'an, Baoji, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Zhengzhou, Changsha, Ningbo, Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin accumulated approximately 3.29 million tons of waste in 1955. If 40% of it is used as fertilizer, it would be equivalent to more than 100,000 tons of soybean cake. However, this garbage that can be used as fertilizer has not been well utilized; some farmers dare not use it, fearing that the garbage contains waste copper, scrap iron, broken glass, etc., which can injure people and livestock.
    In the past, major cities mainly used this garbage for filling pits, because the organic matter in it rots and ferments, emitting a foul odor, becoming a breeding ground for maggots, flies, and germs, which seriously affected urban environmental sanitation. In order to solve this problem, the Beijing Municipal Health Department began to implement a method of separate collection and treatment of garbage in several districts this year, with very good results. The specific method is to publicize and mobilize residents through street health team leaders to store organic matter in the garbage, such as fruit peels, leaves, vegetable scraps, etc., and things that cannot be used as fertilizer, such as coal cinder, separately in two garbage bins (two or several households share two earthen bins), which are collected separately by the health team every day. The organic part is used as fertilizer, and the inorganic part is taken to fill pits. Waste products such as scrap copper, scrap iron, cloth pieces, and glass picked out by residents are regularly purchased door-to-door by the waste products management department of the Municipal Handicraft Production Cooperative. Tianjin City also promoted this method successively in Heping, Nankai, Xinhua, and Hebei districts in April.
    Judging from the method implemented in Beijing, there are many benefits. First, filling pits with inorganic garbage has no odor, and organic garbage can kill various pests and general germs after being composted and fermented, which is good for environmental sanitation; second, Beijing can accumulate more than 200,000 tons of garbage for fertilizer throughout the year (equivalent to about 20,000 tons of soybean cake), and this garbage can be made into granular fertilizer or applied directly to the land; third, residents can sell waste copper, scrap iron, etc., to handicraft cooperatives, which can increase residents' income; fourth, using these discarded materials to make recycled products can increase the country's wealth and the prices are low.
    In short, implementing this method is not only beneficial to hygiene, but also beneficial to the country and individuals. Therefore, it is recommended that major cities try to promote this method according to specific conditions.

    建议城市垃圾分类收集分别处理
    近年来由于城市人口不断增多，城市垃圾也逐年增多，如北京1950年的垃圾积蓄量约为五十五万公方（每公方约合七十公斤），1955年则达到九十五万公方。
    垃圾含有一定的肥分。据上海化验：新鲜垃圾含氮0.54％，含磷0.304％，含有机质33％；天津化验纯有机质垃圾含氮量达1％。如按含氮量0.54％计算，十二斤新鲜垃圾即有相当一斤豆饼的肥效。据统计：西安、宝鸡、广州、武汉、郑州、长沙、宁波、北京、上海、天津十个城市1955年共积垃圾约三百二十九万吨，如有40％用作肥料，可抵十万多吨豆饼。但是这些可作肥料的垃圾没有被很好地利用；有的农民不敢用，怕垃圾内含有废铜、烂铁、碎玻璃等刺伤人畜。
    各大城市过去处理这些垃圾，主要是用来填坑，因为其中有机物腐烂发酵，臭气难闻，成为蛆蝇病菌繁殖的温床，严重地影响了城市环境卫生。北京市卫生部门为了解决这个问题，今年在几个区内开始实行垃圾分类收集，分别处理的办法，效果很好。具体作法是通过街道卫生组长宣传动员住户把垃圾中的有机物质如果皮、树叶、菜屑等和煤球渣等不能作肥料的东西分别存放在两个垃圾箱内（两家或几家合用两个土箱），每天由卫生队分别拉取。有机部分用作肥料，无机部分拉去填坑，住户检出的废品如碎铜、铁、布片、玻璃等，由市手工业生产合作社废品经理部定期挨户收购。天津市在四月间也先后在和平、南开、新华、河北等区推行了这个办法。
    从北京实行的这个办法看来，好处很多。第一，用无机垃圾填坑无臭气，有机垃圾经过堆沤发酵，可以杀死各种病虫和一般的病菌，对环境卫生有好处；第二，北京市全年可积二十多万吨用作肥料的垃圾（约抵豆饼两万多吨），这些垃圾可作成颗粒肥料，或直接上地；第三，居民检出的废铜、烂铁等卖给手工业合作社，可使居民增加一些收入；第四，利用这些废弃物制成再生品，可以给国家增加财富而且价格低廉。
    总之，实行这个办法既有利于卫生，又有利于国家和个人，因此建议各大城市根据具体条件试行推广这个办法。
