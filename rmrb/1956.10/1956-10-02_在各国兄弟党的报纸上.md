Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 1st. The Polish "People's Tribune" published an editorial on September 30th, commenting on the work of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

The editorial pointed out that "These days, we all feel that the problems being discussed and solved in faraway China are very close to us." The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China is a summary of great victories. The Communist Party of China is an example of creatively developing Marxism-Leninism. This creativity means not blindly copying dogmas and imitating ready-made models, but flexibly applying the theory of Marxism-Leninism to the specific conditions of one's own country.

When discussing the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the CPC, the editorial focused on the dictatorship of the proletariat, as well as party building and the mass line. The editorial believes that these two issues, which have long been resolved by the Communist Party of China, are very valuable to the world's workers' movement.

The editorial concluded that the significance of the Eighth National Congress of the CPC in strengthening the world's workers' movement and the socialist camp is immeasurable. It is natural that bourgeois newspapers are uneasy about the strong current of internationalism shown at the conference of this congress. The achievements summarized by the congress and the progress of the congress have become a source of confidence for the entire national liberation movement in Asia and Africa, and a driving force for further carrying out the victorious struggle against colonialism and imperialism.
“Red Right Newspaper” believes: The Eighth National Congress of the CPC is "a station of great significance on the road to the victory of People's China."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 30th. The Czechoslovak "Red Right Newspaper" published an editorial today entitled "A Station of Great Significance on the Road to the Victory of People's China," commenting on the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The editorial said that the achievements of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China have made this congress one of the most important events in the world communist movement in recent years.

The editorial said that this congress once again shows how vigilantly the Communist Party of China defends the purity of revolutionary thought, how hard it struggles against all dogmatic phenomena, and how skillfully and creatively it applies Marxism-Leninism to the specific environment of China. This congress also once again shows that People's China stands shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Union and has established close, friendly and beneficial ties with all socialist countries.

Many Czechoslovak newspapers, such as "People's Defense Newspaper," "Labor Newspaper," "Agricultural Newspaper," and "Youth Front Newspaper," published editorials and commentaries today celebrating China's National Day.

"Labor News" Congratulates Our Country on New Victories in Socialist Construction

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 1st. The Korean "Labor News" published an editorial on September 30th, congratulating the success of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

The editorial said that the documents of this congress are a summary of the historical experience of the Communist Party of China. These documents put forward and elucidated the theoretical and practical issues concerning party activities, socialist construction practice, the international communist and workers' movement, the national liberation movement, and the struggle to defend peace at a high level of Marxism-Leninism.

The editorial pointed out that the Communist Party of China has set a good example of creatively combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolutionary struggle. The Communist Party of China and its leader Comrade Mao Zedong have enriched the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. The rich experience of the Communist Party of China is a valuable reference for the Korean Workers' Party.

The editorial finally congratulated the Chinese people on their new victories in socialist construction.

"People's Voice" said that the Congress is a major event in the life of the Chinese people.

Xinhua News Agency, September 29th. According to the Albanian News Agency: Newspapers in Tirana published editorials and articles on the 28th, commenting on the conclusion of the work of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

"People's Voice" said that the congress is a major event in the life of the Chinese people. The work of the congress is characterized by the correct application of Marxist-Leninist methods. The main reports at the congress and the discussions on the reports include very extensive experience, which is useful not only for China but also for the entire international labor movement.

"People's Voice" continued, the important significance of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China transcends the borders of China. This congress is a remarkable proof of proletarian internationalism.

The Albanian Communists and the entire people sincerely congratulate their Chinese friends on their great victory, and wish them further achievements in realizing the great tasks set by their historic congress, which will be a new contribution to China's socialist construction, to the consolidation of the entire international communist movement and the workers' movement, and to the maintenance of world peace and security.

    在各国兄弟党的报纸上
    “人民论坛报”评论说：“这些天来，在遥远的中国所讨论解决的问题，对我们是很亲切的”。
    新华社华沙1日电　波兰“人民论坛报”在9月30日发表社论，评论中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的工作。
    社论指出，这些天来，我们都感到在遥远的中国所讨论解决的问题，对我们是很亲切的。中国共产党第八次全国代表大会是伟大的胜利的总结。中国共产党是创造性地发展马克思列宁主义的范例。这种创造就是不盲目地硬搬教条和摹仿现成的模型，而是灵活地把马克思列宁主义的理论运用到自己国家的具体情况中。
    社论在谈到中共八大的精神的时候，着重谈到了无产阶级专政、以及党的建设和群众路线这两个问题。社论认为，这两个早已由中国共产党解决了的问题，对世界工人运动是十分珍贵的。
    社论最后说，中共八大对加强世界工人运动和社会主义阵营的力量的意义是不可估量的。资产阶级报纸对这次代表大会的会议上所表现出来的强大的国际主义的潮流流露出不安，是很自然的。代表大会所总结的成就以及代表大会的进程，成了使亚非两洲整个民族解放运动获得信心的泉源，成了进一步开展反殖民主义和帝国主义的胜利斗争的推动力量。“红色权利报”认为：中共第八次代表大会是“人民中国的胜利的道路上具有重大意义的一个站口”。
    新华社布拉格30日电　捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”今天以“人民中国的胜利的道路上具有重大意义的一个站口”为题发表了社论，评论中国共产党第八次全国代表大会。社论说，中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的成就，已经使这次大会成为几年来世界共产主义运动中最重要的事件之一。
    社论说，这次代表大会再一次表明，中国共产党是怎样地警惕地保卫革命思想的纯洁性，怎样对一切教条主义的现象进行艰苦的斗争，并且怎样熟练地、创造性地把马克思列宁主义运用在中国的具体环境中。这次大会也再一次表明，人民中国同苏联并肩站在一起，并且同一切社会主义国家建立了亲密的友好而有益的联系。
    捷克斯洛伐克许多报纸如“人民防线报”、“劳动报”、“农业报”、“青年阵线报”等今天都发表了庆祝中国国庆的社论和评论。
  “劳动新闻”祝贺我国在社会主义建设中取得新的胜利
    新华社平壤1日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”9月30日发表社论，祝贺中共第八次全国代表大会的成功。
    社论说，这次大会的文件是中国共产党历史经验的总结。这些文件在高度的马克思列宁主义的水平上提出和阐明了关于党的活动、社会主义建设实践、国际共产主义和工人运动、民族解放运动、保卫和平的斗争等理论和实践的问题。
    社论指出，中国共产党作出了把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命斗争的具体实践创造性结合起来的好榜样。中国共产党和它的领导者毛泽东同志丰富了马克思列宁主义的宝库。中国共产党的丰富的经验是朝鲜劳动党的宝贵借鉴。
    社论最后祝贺中国人民在社会主义建设中取得新的胜利。
    “人民之声报”说，代表大会是中国人民生活中的一件大事
    新华社29日讯　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：地拉那各报在28日发表社论和文章，评中国共产党第八次全国代表大会工作的结束。
    “人民之声报”说，代表大会是中国人民生活中的一件大事。代表大会的工作的特点是正确地运用马克思列宁主义的方法。代表大会上的主要报告和就报告进行的讨论包括有非常广泛的经验，这些经验不仅对中国，而且对整个国际劳工运动都是有用的。
    “人民之声报”接着说，中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的重要意义超出了中国的疆界。这次代表大会是无产阶级国际主义的显著的证明。
    阿尔巴尼亚共产党人和全体人民衷心祝贺他们的中国朋友取得的重大胜利，并祝他们在实现他们的有历史意义的代表大会所规定的伟大任务中取得进一步的成就，这些成就将是对中国社会主义建设、对巩固整个国际共产主义运动和工人运动和对维护世界和平和安全的新的贡献。
