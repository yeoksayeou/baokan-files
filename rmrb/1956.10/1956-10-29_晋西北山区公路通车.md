    Highway Opens in the Northwestern Shanxi Mountainous Area

    (Our newspaper reports) Two highways in the remote mountainous area of northwestern Shanxi Province, the old revolutionary base area, connecting Ningwu to Hequ and Pianguan counties, have recently opened to traffic.

    Except for the 25 kilometers from Ningwu to Yijing in Shenchi, which was an existing road, the remaining 162 kilometers from Yijing via Sancha to Hequ and Pianguan were built using the state's work-for-relief method, starting in October of last year.

    The opening of these two highways from Ningwu to Hequ and Pianguan is of great significance for connecting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, invigorating the economic life of the people in the mountainous areas, and changing the impoverished appearance of the mountainous areas. In the past, the abundant coal, sulfur, and fruits produced in these areas were difficult to transport due to inconvenient transportation; the means of production and daily necessities needed by the people in the mountainous areas could not be imported in a timely manner either. Now that these two highways are open to traffic, not only is transportation timely, but freight rates have also been reduced. The average cost of transporting one ton of goods from Ningwu to Hequ and Pianguan is more than 30 yuan cheaper than by horse-drawn cart. The opening of the highways has also facilitated travel between the people in the mountainous areas and other places. Residents of Hequ County reflected: "In the past, it took us eight days to travel to Ningwu and back, but now it only takes two days." (Hao Quanzhu, Feng Zhide)

    晋西北山区公路通车
    本报讯　山西省西北偏僻山区，老革命根据地宁武至河曲、偏关等县的两条公路，已于最近通车。
    这两条公路除宁武至神池义井的二十五公里是原有公路外，其余由义井经三岔至河曲、偏关的一百六十二公里都是国家用以工代赈的办法，从去年10月开始修筑的。
    宁武至河曲、偏关这两条公路的通车，对沟通城乡的物资交流，活跃山区人民的经济生活和改变贫脊的山区的面貌，有着很大的关系。过去，这些地方盛产的煤炭、硫磺和水果等，因为交通不便，运出很困难；山区人民所需要的生产资料和生活用品，也不能及时地输入。现在，这两条公路通车后，不仅运输及时，货物运价也降低了。由宁武到河曲、偏关，平均每吨运价比马车节省三十多元。公路通车后也便利了山区人民同外地的往来。河曲县群众反映说：过去，我们到宁武，往返一次就得走八天，现在只用两天就行了。（郝全珠、冯志德）
