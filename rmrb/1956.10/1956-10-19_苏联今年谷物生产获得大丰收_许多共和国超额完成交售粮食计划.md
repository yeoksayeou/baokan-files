Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper, October 18th: This year, the Soviet Union's grain production has achieved its largest harvest in history. The collective farms and state farms of various republics are nearing completion of their grain deliveries to the state, and many republics have exceeded their grain delivery targets. The Russian Federal Republic, which ranks first in the country for grain deliveries this year, and the Kazakh Republic, which ranks second, had jointly delivered 3,004,340,000 poods (one pood equals 32.76 market catties) to the state by October 10th. This is nearly half as much again as the total grain purchased from all republics in the Soviet Union in 1953, which was 2,010,000,000 poods.

As of now, other republics have exceeded their state grain purchase targets as follows: Azerbaijan Republic 104.5%, Uzbek Republic 100.6%, Turkmen Republic 101.5%, Georgian Republic 121%, Belorussian Republic 102%, Tajik Republic, Kyrgyz Republic, Armenian Republic, and Moldavian Republic have also exceeded their grain delivery plans.

The victory of the Soviet agricultural bumper harvest is a great victory for a series of measures implemented by the Soviet Communist Party in recent years to vigorously improve agricultural production. Over the past three years, the government has invested tens of billions of rubles in agricultural production, resulting in significant improvements in agricultural machinery and production technology. In the Kazakh Republic alone, 166,000 tractors, hundreds of thousands of combine harvesters, automobiles, and other agricultural machines have been added in these three years. Since the large-scale reclamation of wasteland in 1954, more than 600,000 patriots have responded to the call of the Soviet Communist Party and the government to go to Kazakhstan to participate in the reclamation effort.

The large-scale reclamation of wasteland plays a huge role in increasing agricultural output. Currently, the Soviet Union has reclaimed 35.5 million hectares of wasteland. In 1953, the total sown area of the Kazakh Republic was only 7 million hectares, while in 1956, the sown area of the republic reached 23 million hectares. Crops on the newly reclaimed land are growing particularly well. After the bumper harvest, the income of state farm workers and collective farm members has greatly increased. State farms in the Kazakh Republic alone will receive a profit of one billion rubles this year. (Attached picture)

    苏联今年谷物生产获得大丰收
    许多共和国超额完成交售粮食计划
    本报莫斯科18日电　今年苏联的谷物生产获得历史上最大一次丰收，各共和国集体农庄和国营农场向国家交售粮食的工作将近结束，许多共和国都超额完成了交售粮食的任务。占今年全苏交售粮食第一位的俄罗斯联邦共和国和第二位的哈萨克共和国，到10月10日已共同交售给国家粮食三十亿零四百三十四万普特（每普特合三十二点七六市斤），比1953年全苏各共和国总的采购粮食数字二十亿一千万普特还多将近一半。
    截至目前为止，其他各共和国超额完成国家采购粮食任务的情况如下：阿塞拜疆共和国104.5％，乌兹别克共和国100.6％，土库曼共和国101.5％，格鲁吉亚共和国121％，白俄罗斯共和国102％，塔吉克共和国、吉尔吉斯共和国、亚美尼亚共和国和摩尔达维亚共和国也都超额完成了交售粮食的计划。
    苏联农业大丰收的胜利，是苏联共产党近年来实行大力提高农业生产的一系列措施的伟大胜利。三年来，政府在农业生产上的投资达几百亿卢布，因而农业机械和生产技术得到了很大的改进。哈萨克共和国在这三年里增加了十六万六千台拖拉机、几十万台联合收割机、汽车和其他农业机器。从1954年大规模开荒以来，共有六十多万爱国者响应苏联共产党和政府的号召，去到哈萨克参加开垦的工作。
    大规模开垦荒地对提高农业产量起着巨大的作用。目前苏联已开垦了三千五百五十万公顷荒地。哈萨克共和国在1953年全部播种面积只有七百万公顷，而1956年共和国播种面积已达到二千三百万公顷。新开荒地的庄稼长得特别好。大丰收后，国营农场工作者和集体农庄庄员的收入大大增加。仅仅哈萨克共和国国营农场在今年就得到十亿卢布的利润。（附图片）
