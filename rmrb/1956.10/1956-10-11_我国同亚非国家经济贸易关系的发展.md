The Development of Economic and Trade Relations Between China and Asian-African Countries
Wang Baoren

Since the Asian-African Conference, under the encouragement of the "Bandung Spirit" and based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for sovereignty, China's economic and trade relations with Asian-African countries have seen new developments. This development is specifically manifested in the improvement of trade relations, the expansion of trade volume, and the increase in friendly exchanges. China has not only further developed its economic and trade relations with India, Burma, Ceylon, and Indonesia, but has also established normal trade relations with Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Cambodia, and other countries, and concluded government-level trade agreements. In 1955, China's total trade volume with Asian-African countries increased by 70% compared to 1954, with India increasing more than fourfold, Burma increasing thirtyfold, Indonesia increasing more than twofold, Egypt increasing more than twofold, Pakistan increasing more than twofold, and Japan increasing more than twofold. China's trade with other Asian-African countries has also increased to varying degrees.

The increasingly improved economic and trade relations have promoted exchanges between trade personnel and friendly contacts between the countries. In 1955 and 1956, China successively received trade delegations from Asian-African countries such as Burma, Egypt, Ceylon, and Cambodia, trade inspection groups from Singapore and Malaya, and trade delegations from Japanese business circles. At the same time, many government officials and business people from Asian-African countries have continuously visited China. The Chinese government has also sent trade delegations to Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Sudan. The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade sent a trade delegation to Japan. Various specialized import and export corporations in China have also sent many business personnel to Asian-African countries such as Egypt, Burma, India, Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, and Lebanon to conduct trade activities. China has held commodity exhibitions in Damascus, New Delhi, Jakarta, Karachi, Cairo, Tokyo, Osaka, and other places to introduce China's economic construction achievements and rich export commodities in recent years. These friendly exchanges, trade contacts, and exhibitions not only help China and Asian-African countries understand each other and enhance mutual friendship, but also greatly promote the further development of economic and trade relations between China and Asian-African countries.

The development of economic and trade relations between China and Asian-African countries is also reflected in the changes in the structure of China's export commodities to Asian-African countries. China's agricultural products, native products, and handicrafts exported to the Asian-African region have long been welcomed by the people of Asia and Africa. However, China was unable to supply the machinery and equipment and light industrial products for daily use that Asian-African countries and people urgently needed in the past, and most of the Asian-African countries imported them from Western capitalist countries. In recent years, with the development of China's socialist industrial construction, China's industrial products have the potential to be exported to Asian-African countries. Export varieties include steel, cement, building materials, caustic soda, cotton cloth, cotton yarn and other industrial products. These commodities have been praised by the people of Asia and Africa. We used these products to exchange for raw materials such as cotton, jute, rubber, coconut, and flue-cured tobacco needed by China from India, Egypt, Ceylon, Pakistan, Burma, and other Asian-African countries. The change in the structure of China's export commodities reflects that China's economic cooperation with Asian-African countries has become more extensive.

The strengthening of China's economic cooperation with Asian-African countries is also reflected in China's export of a textile factory with more than 20,000 spindles to Burma. This is the first time China has exported complete sets of machinery and equipment to Asian-African countries, which not only demonstrates the improvement of China's industrial level, but also marks the development of friendship between China and Burma. Recently, Asian-African countries such as Indonesia, Burma, India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Cambodia have successively requested China to supply them with more than 40 projects such as textile factories, silk reeling factories, paper mills, gunny bag factories, sugar factories, flour mills, and match factories.

China's economic cooperation with Cambodia has made important progress. In April of this year, the Chinese government and the economic delegation of the Royal Government of Cambodia signed the "Trade Agreement and Payment Agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Royal Government of Cambodia" in Beijing, and in June, the "Agreement on Economic Assistance between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Royal Government of Cambodia" was signed. These two agreements were signed in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and based on the desire for mutual support and mutual assistance. The economic assistance agreement stipulates that China will provide the Kingdom of Cambodia with materials and commodities worth 800 million Cambodian Riels (equivalent to 8 million pounds) free of charge within two years from 1956 to 1957, and provide technical assistance. This assistance is not attached to any conditions and is entirely to help the Kingdom of Cambodia develop its economy and improve the lives of the Cambodian people.

Of course, due to China's very backward economy in the past, and the current industrial and technological level is not high, and the strength is still limited, the scope of economic cooperation with Asian-African countries cannot be very large at present, but the Chinese people not only want to make their country prosperous and strong, but also hope that other countries will become prosperous and strong. We believe that the achievements and broad prospects of China's economic development will enable China's economic cooperation with Asian-African countries to have more full development possibilities.

Western colonialists, especially the US aggressive bloc, are unwilling to see the development of China's economic and trade relations with Asian-African countries. They openly obstruct Asian-African countries from developing mutually beneficial economic and trade relations with China through various means of coercion and inducement. This is the fundamental reason why trade between China and Japan and some Asian-African countries cannot be completely normalized. It is because of the interference of the US government that the Japanese government implements the US's "embargo" policy and has not given due support to the expansion of Sino-Japanese trade. Therefore, many urgently needed exports from Japan, which are also needed by China, cannot be exported to China, which makes Sino-Japanese trade far behind the degree of development it should have. If all artificial obstacles are eliminated and the exchange of commodity varieties between the two countries is further expanded, it is believed that Sino-Japanese trade will have better development.

In June of this year, the United Kingdom announced that colonial governments, when considering export license applications, could exercise their judgment within appropriate limits without specifically consulting London. On June 4, the governments of Malaya and Singapore announced the lifting of the rubber "embargo." When this news spread all over the world, the rubber prices in the Singapore and London markets immediately stopped falling and rebounded. Recently, according to news reports, Japan has also repeatedly stated that it will take concrete measures to expand Sino-Japanese trade and requested the "Paris Coordinating Committee" to lift the "embargo" on certain Japanese products. The Japanese Commodity Exhibition currently being held in Beijing, China, will also exhibit a part of the "embargoed" materials. These all indicate that the "embargo" policy that harms the economic interests of Asian-African countries is disintegrating. The people of Asia and Africa are fully confident that they will increasingly strengthen their economic cooperation with each other and get rid of foreign interference.

We believe that eliminating obstacles to economic cooperation in Asian-African countries, further developing China's economic, trade and technical cooperation with Asian-African countries, and promoting the free development of normal economic and trade relations between Asian-African countries will not only help the cause of peace in the Asian-African region, but also help the economic development of Asian-African countries and bring happiness to the people of Asia and Africa.

    我国同亚非国家经济贸易关系的发展
    王葆仁
    亚非会议以后，在“万隆精神”的鼓舞下，在平等互利和互相尊重主权的基础上，我国同亚非国家经济贸易关系有了新的发展。这种发展具体表现在贸易关系的改善、贸易额的扩大和友好往来的增加。我国不仅进一步发展了同印度、缅甸、锡兰、印度尼西亚的经济贸易关系，同时同埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、柬埔寨等国也先后建立了正常的贸易关系，缔结了政府之间的贸易协定。1955年我国同亚非国家的贸易总额比1954年增加了70％，其中印度增加四倍多，缅甸增加三十倍，印度尼西亚增加一倍多，埃及增加二倍多，巴基斯坦增加一倍多，日本增加二倍多。我国同其他亚非国家的贸易也有不同程度的增加。
    经济贸易关系的日益改善，促进了双方国家间贸易人员的往来和友好接触。在1955年和1956年，我国先后接待了缅甸、埃及、锡兰、柬埔寨等亚非国家的贸易代表团，新加坡、马来亚的贸易考察团，日本实业界贸易代表团。同时，还有不少亚非国家的政府官员和工商界人士接连不断地来我国访问。我国政府也派出了去叙利亚、黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯、埃及、苏丹的贸易代表团。我国国际贸易促进委员会派出了去日本的贸易代表团。我国经营进出口业务的各专业公司也派出不少业务人员去埃及、缅甸、印度、巴基斯坦、苏丹、叙利亚、黎巴嫩等亚非国家进行贸易活动。我国在大马士革、新德里、雅加达、喀喇蚩、开罗、东京、大阪等地先后举办了商品展览会，介绍我国几年来经济建设成就和丰富的出口商品。这些友好往来、贸易接触和展览，不仅有助于我国同亚非国家相互之间的了解，增进相互之间的友谊，并且也大大的促进了我国同亚非国家经济贸易关系的进一步发展。
    我国同亚非国家经济贸易关系的发展还表现在我国向亚非国家出口商品结构的变化上。我国向亚非地区出口的农产品、土特产品、手工艺品等，早已受到亚非人民的欢迎。但是，亚非国家和人民迫切需要的机器设备和日用百货等轻工业品，我国过去是不能供应的，亚非国家大部都从西方资本主义国家进口。近年来，随着我国社会主义工业建设的发展，我国的工业产品有可能向亚非国家出口。出口品种包括钢材、水泥、建筑器材、烧碱、棉布、棉纱等各种工业产品。这些商品受到亚非人民的称赞。我们用这些产品换回了印度、埃及、锡兰、巴基斯坦、缅甸和其他一些亚非国家的棉花、黄麻、橡胶、椰子、烤烟等我国需要的原料。我国出口商品结构的变化，反映了我国同亚非国家进行经济合作的范围更广泛了。
    我国同亚非国家经济合作的加强，还表现在我国向缅甸输出一座二万多纱锭的纺织厂。这是我国第一次向亚非国家输出成套机器设备，这不仅表现了我国工业水平的提高，也标志着中缅两国友谊的发展。最近，印度尼西亚、缅甸、印度、巴基斯坦、沙特阿拉伯和柬埔寨等亚非国家先后要求我国供应它们纺织厂、缫丝厂、造纸厂、麻袋厂、制糖厂、面粉厂、火柴厂等四十多个项目。
    我国同柬埔寨的经济合作有了重要发展。今年4月，我国政府同柬埔寨王国政府经济代表团在北京签订了“中华人民共和国政府和柬埔寨王国政府贸易协定和支付协定”，6月又签订了“中华人民共和国政府和柬埔寨王国政府关于经济援助的协定”。这两个协定是按照和平共处的五项原则，根据互相支持和互相帮助的愿望签订的。经济援助协定规定，我国将在1956—1957年两年内无偿地援助柬埔寨王国价值八亿柬元（折为八百万英镑）的物资和商品，并提供技术援助，这些援助是不附带任何条件的，完全为了帮助柬埔寨王国发展经济和改善柬埔寨人民的生活。
    当然，由于我国经济过去十分落后，现在的工业、技术水平也还不高，力量也还有限，因而现时同亚非国家经济合作的范围还不能很大，可是中国人民不但要使自己的国家富强，同时也希望别国富强，我们相信，中国经济发展的成果和远大前景，将使中国同亚非各国的经济合作更有充分发展的可能。
    西方殖民主义者尤其是美国侵略集团不愿看到我国同亚非国家经济贸易关系的发展。他们用各种威迫利诱的手段公开阻挠亚非国家同我国发展互利的经济贸易关系。这就是我国同日本和某些亚非国家的贸易不能完全正常化的根本原因。就是因为美国政府的干涉，日本政府执行美国的“禁运”政策，对扩大中日贸易没有给予应有的支持，因此，日本有很多迫切需要出口的、同时也是我国需要的某些产品不能对我国输出，这就使得中日贸易大大落后于应有的发展程度。如果消除一切人为的障碍，使两国商品品种的交换更加扩大，相信中日贸易一定会有更好的发展。
    今年6月，英国宣布各殖民地政府在考虑出口许可证申请的时候，可以在适当限度内运用它们的判断，不需要具体地同伦敦商量。6月4日马来亚、新加坡政府宣布取消橡胶“禁运”。当这个消息传遍全世界的时候，新加坡和伦敦市场的橡胶价格立刻止跌回涨。最近据消息报道，日本也一再表示要采取具体措施扩大中日贸易，并且要求“巴黎统筹委员会”解除某些日本产品的“禁运”。正在我国北京举办的日本商品展览会也将展出一部分“禁运”物资。这些，都说明了损害亚非国家经济利益的“禁运”政策正在瓦解。亚非人民完全有信心日益加强彼此间的经济合作，摆脱外来干涉。
    我们相信，消除亚非国家经济合作的障碍，进一步发展我国同亚非国家经济贸易和技术合作，促进亚非国家间正常经济关系和贸易关系的自由发展，不仅有助于亚非地区的和平事业，也将有助于亚非国家经济的发展，给亚非人民带来幸福。
