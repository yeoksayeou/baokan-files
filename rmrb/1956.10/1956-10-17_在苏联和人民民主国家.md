    In the Soviet Union and People's Democracies
    Artificial Lake Appears Near Sofia
    The largest hydraulic hub in Bulgaria has recently been completed on the upper reaches of the Iskar River near Sofia. The entire project includes a reservoir, three hydroelectric power stations, and some irrigation canals.
    The new reservoir has a storage capacity of 670 million cubic meters, and people call it "Sofia Sea." "Sofia Sea" supplies the water needed by hydroelectric power stations and irrigation canals. It is also a good place for workers to rest. The Pasarel Hydropower Station with a capacity of 28,000 kilowatts and the Kokalyane Hydropower Station with a capacity of 22,000 kilowatts can generate 170 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. After the irrigation canals are used, the irrigated area in the densely populated suburbs of Sofia will be expanded to 410,000 hectares, greatly promoting the development of animal husbandry and vegetable cultivation here.
    Bulgaria Builds Atomic Energy Experimental Center
    With the help of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria is building a scientific experimental center for the peaceful use of atomic energy near Sofia.
    At present, 23 buildings of this experimental center are under construction, including the laboratories and workshops of the Physics Institute and the building for placing the atomic reactor.
    It is expected that the building for placing the atomic reactor will be completed this year.
    Warsaw to Build Central Botanical Garden
    The Polish Academy of Sciences recently began constructing a Central Botanical Garden in Warsaw, which will be one of the largest botanical gardens in Europe.
    This Central Botanical Garden is located within the new boundaries of the Polish capital and will include a variety of terrains; there are many types of soil and it is suitable for digging ponds and canals. The botanical garden is adjacent to large forests, large parks, several state-owned farms, and many herbal botanical gardens. This creates a variety of good conditions for the Central Botanical Garden in applying land cultivation experience.
    The Central Botanical Garden will cover an area of 230 hectares. A scientific laboratory, a plant museum, several exhibition halls, and student summer internship classes will be established in the Central Botanical Garden.
    Currently, Warsaw only has a university botanical garden of several hectares. It cannot provide suitable conditions for the development of Polish botanical science.
    The Central Botanical Garden will carry out scientific research work and experimental work related to all aspects of plants. It will become a scientific research base for Polish agriculture and horticulture, as well as the timber industry. In addition, it will also be a place for residents of the capital to rest.
    It is expected that the entire construction of this Central Botanical Garden will be completed within fifteen years.
    Soviet Union Builds World's Largest Whaling Mother Ship
    The Soviet Union is building the world's largest whaling mother ship, which can work for 20 whaling ships, processing 65 whales averaging 50 tons each day and night, twice as large as the Soviet Union's existing "Glory" whaling ship.
    Gorbunko, the director of the hull workshop of the Nosenko Shipyard (in Nikolaev) that manufactured the ship, said that the ship will be equipped with the latest technical equipment to make full use of whales. Even the latest "William Barents II" whaling ship manufactured by the Netherlands this year does not have such refrigerated cabins and freezing equipment as this ship.
    This huge whaling station can obtain and process 48,000 tons of whale oil, 5,000 tons of frozen meat, 2,000 tons of meat powder, 4,000 tons of bone meal, more than 100 tons of leather raw materials, many frozen livers, visceral raw materials, protein semi-finished products and other products in one working season.
    Hungarian Fashion Exhibition in Moscow
    The Hungarian Fashion Exhibition, organized by the Hungarian foreign trade agency, opened on the 3rd of this month at the Central House of Art Workers in Moscow. The exhibition displayed 250 new styles of clothing for women, men and children, as well as many fur products, shoes and boots, nylon and rayon shirts, scarves, gloves and clothing items.
    Hungary's best fashion performers have come to Moscow. They wore nearly 80 different women's costumes. Visitors can also see 20 styles of children's tops here. Most of the costumes on display are the latest styles for 1956-1957, some of which have won championships in international fashion competitions. All clothing is sewn with Hungarian fabrics.
    Hungary's clothing industry strives to use ordinary and economical clothing materials to sew beautiful and generous fashions. This kind of clothing is very popular among the working people.
    While the fashion show was in progress, the famous Hungarian "Budapest" band also accompanied the performance in the exhibition hall, and the famous Hungarian female singer Akos also participated in the singing. The exhibition also has a Hungarian restaurant. It can allow Muscovites to taste Hungarian delicacies.
    Dvořák's Collection of Letters Recently Published
    Music lovers in Czechoslovakia have recently obtained some very precious musical readings: three collections of letters and memoirs about the founders of Czech national music, Dvořák, Smetana, and Janáček.
    These books are edited and published by the Czechoslovak "Artia" Publishing House. They introduce to readers the lives and work of these outstanding musicians, as well as the various difficulties they encountered in their work during their lifetime. The book also includes many photos and illustrations reflecting the lives of musicians. In order to allow foreign musicians and music lovers to understand the great composers of Czechoslovakia, these books are also translated into English and German for publication.

    在苏联和人民民主国家
    索非亚附近出现人造海
    在索非亚附近的伊斯基尔河上游，保加利亚最大的一个水力枢纽已在最近建成。全部工程包括一个水库、三个水电站和一些灌溉渠。
    新水库的蓄水量为六亿七千万立方公尺，人们称它为“索非亚海”。“索非亚海”供给水电站和灌溉渠所需要的水，同时它也是劳动者游息的好地方。功率二万八千瓩的帕萨列尔水电站和功率二万二千瓩的科卡利亚涅水电站，每年可以发出一亿七千万瓩时的电力。灌溉渠使用以后，将使人烟稠密的索非亚郊区的灌溉面积扩大到四十一万公顷，大大促进这里的饲畜业和种菜业的发展。
    保建设原子能实验中心
    保加利亚在苏联帮助下正在索非亚附近建设一个和平利用原子能的科学实验中心。
    目前，这个实验中心的二十三座建筑物正在修建中，其中包括物理研究所的实验室、工场和放置原子反应堆的建筑物。
    预计，放置原子反应堆的建筑物将在今年建成。
    华沙将建中央植物园
    波兰科学院最近在华沙开始建造一个中央植物园，这将是欧洲最大的植物园之一。
    这个中央植物园设在波兰首都的新边界以内，将包括各种各样的地形；有很多种的土壤，并适合于开凿池塘和运河。植物园的邻近有大片森林、大的公园、几个国营农场和许多草本植物园。这样就为中央植物园在应用土地耕种经验方面创造了多方面的良好条件。
    中央植物园的面积将占二百三十公顷，在中央植物园将成立一个科学实验室、一个植物馆、几个展览馆，以及学生暑期实习班等等。
    现在，华沙只有一个数公顷大的大学植物园。它不能为发展波兰植物科学提供适当的条件。
    中央植物园将进行科学研究工作以及有关植物的各方面的实验工作。它将成为波兰农业和果艺以及木材工业的科学研究基地。此外，它还将是首都居民的休息场所。
    预计这个中央植物园的全部建造工作将要在十五年之内完成。苏联制造世界最大捕鲸主船
    苏联正在制造一艘世界最大的捕鲸主船，它可以为二十只捕鲸船工作，每昼夜加工六十五条平均重五十吨的鲸鱼，比苏联现有的“光荣号”捕鲸船大一倍。
    承制这艘船只的诺森科造船厂（在尼古拉耶夫）的船身车间主任戈尔本科说，船上将装有最新的技术设备，使鲸鱼得到充分的利用。即使是今年荷兰制造的最新的“威廉·巴伦茨二世号”捕鲸船也没有像这艘船这样有冷藏船舱和冷冻设备。
    这艘巨大的捕鲸站工作一季，可以得到和加工四万八千吨鲸鱼油脂，五千吨冻肉，两千吨肉粉，四千吨骨粉，一百多吨皮革原料，许多冰冻的肝、腔内原料、蛋白质半制成品和其他产品。
    莫斯科的匈牙利时装展览
    由匈牙利对外贸易机构举办的匈牙利时装展览会于本月三日在莫斯科艺术工作者中央之家开幕了。展览会展出了二百五十种新式的妇女、男子和儿童的服装，同时还陈列了许多毛皮制品、鞋靴、尼龙和人造丝制成的衬衣、围巾、手套和服饰等衣着用品。
    匈牙利最好的时装表演者都来到了莫斯科。她们穿出近八十种不同的妇女装束。参观的人在这里还可以看到二十种儿童上衣的样式。展出的服装大都是1956—1957年度的最新样式，其中有些样式在国际服装比赛会上曾获得锦标。全部服装都是用匈牙利织品缝制成的。
    匈牙利的服装工业尽力应用普通的经济的衣料来缝制美丽大方的时装。这种衣服很受劳动人民的欢迎。
    在进行时装表演的同时，匈牙利著名的“布达佩斯”乐队还在展览厅里伴奏，匈牙利著名的女歌唱家阿科什也参加了演唱。展览会还设有匈牙利餐厅。它可以使莫斯科人尝一尝匈牙利的美味。
    德沃夏克书信集最近问世
    捷克斯洛伐克的音乐爱好者最近得到了一些很珍贵的音乐读物：三部关于捷克斯洛伐克民族音乐的奠基人德沃夏克、斯麦塔纳和雅那切克的书信集和回忆录。
    这些书是由捷克斯洛伐克的“阿梯亚”出版社编辑出版的。它们向读者介绍了这些杰出的音乐家们的生活和工作情况，以及他们生前在工作中所遇到的各种困难情形。书中还附有许多反映音乐家生活的照片和插图。为了使国外的音乐家和音乐爱好者们了解捷克斯洛伐克的伟大作曲家们，这些书同时还译成英文和德文出版。
