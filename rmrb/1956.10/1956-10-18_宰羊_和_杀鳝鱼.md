    "Slaughtering Sheep" and "Killing Eels"
    In the article "'Reactionary Trivial Novels' Questioned," published on page 8 of the People's Daily on September 13th, the author, when recalling Wei Jinzhi's short story "Dusk in Leaving Town," praised by Lu Xun, wrote: "...In that small town, every evening, a group of people routinely gathered in front of the butcher's shop, watching the slaughter of sheep with great interest, a scene that remains vivid in my mind..." This passage is likely a mistake in the author's memory. It does not align with the content of Wei Jinzhi's short story "Dusk in Leaving Town." According to the original text of the novel in the "Chinese New Literature Series," Collection of Novels, Volume Two, published by Shanghai Liangyou Book Printing Company in July 1935, Wei Jinzhi focused on describing the scene of a group of people watching "killing eels" in front of "a restaurant near the bridge" in the small town, not watching the slaughter of sheep in front of the butcher's shop.
    It is suggested that when the People's Daily publishes articles citing certain materials, it should, if possible, verify them before publication.

    “宰羊”和“杀鳝鱼”
    9月13日人民日报第八版登出的“‘反动的无聊的小说’质疑”一文中，作者在回忆为鲁迅所称许的魏金枝的短篇小说“留下镇上的黄昏”时，有这样一段话：“……那小镇上每天黄昏一群人照例围在羊肉铺前津津有味看宰羊的场景，至今犹在眼前……”这一段话恐怕作者记忆错了。因为它和魏金枝的短篇小说“留下镇上的黄昏”内容不符。根据1935年7月由上海良友图书印刷公司印行的“中国新文学大系”小说二集中的小说原文，魏金枝着重描写了在小镇上一群人在“临桥的一家馆子”前看“杀鳝鱼”的情景，并不是在羊肉铺前看宰羊。
    建议人民日报在发表引证了某些材料的文章时，尽可能地在发稿前核对一下。
