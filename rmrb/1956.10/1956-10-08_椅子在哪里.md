    Where is the Chair?
    Li Wenrong
    After getting off the train, I went to the Beijing Railway Station baggage claim to pick up my luggage. The luggage hadn't arrived yet, and I couldn't wait due to other matters, so I discussed it with the comrade in charge of the baggage: to send the luggage to me within a day or two.
    Two days passed, and the luggage hadn't been sent. I called more than ten times before getting through, and the person on the other end said that there was too much luggage, and it wouldn't be easy to sort it out right away, but it would be delivered in a couple of days.
    I waited another week, and there was still no sign of it. I had to go to the station again to look for it. The comrade in charge of storing the luggage pointed to a pile of luggage more than a person high and said, "There's too much luggage, go find it yourself." After rummaging around for a while, I found two pieces of luggage, but a sofa chair with a white cover was nowhere to be found. I had to ask the station attendant again. He frowned and said, "You go back first, and we'll send it to you after we find it." I had no confidence in waiting, so I described the shape of the chair to him in detail and asked him to think about it. He said: It seems like I saw such a chair in the baggage exchange office.
    With a glimmer of hope, I went to the baggage exchange office. An employee was sitting on a sofa chair with a white cover. I took a closer look and saw that it still had the baggage tag on it, which was exactly my chair. Unexpectedly, something that they had said several times was difficult to find had actually left the baggage storage area on its own and run to the buttocks of the employee in the exchange office.

    椅子在哪里
    李文容
    下了火车我就去北京车站行李票房取行李。行李还没到，我又因事不能等，就和管理行李的同志商量好：一两天内把行李给我寄去。
    两天过去了，行李没寄来。电话打了十几次才打通了，对方说行李太多，当下不易弄清楚，过两天总会送来的。
    我又等了一星期，连影子都不见。只得再到车站去找。负责保管行李的同志指着堆得一人多高的行李堆说：“行李太多了，你自己到那里去找吧。”翻腾一阵，两件行李找到了，但还有一张白套子的沙发椅子，却遍寻不见。只得再去问车站服务员。他皱皱眉说：“你先回去罢，以后查出来给你送去。”我对等是没有信心的了，便把椅子的外形详细地向他描述了一番，让他想想。他说：好像是在行李换票房里看到过这样一个椅子。
    我怀着一线希望到了行李换票房。一个工作人员的屁股下，坐着一个白套子的沙发椅子。走前详细一看，上面还挂着行李票签，这正是我的椅子。想不到几次都说难以找到的东西，竟能自己离开行李栈，跑到换票房的工作人员屁股下去。
