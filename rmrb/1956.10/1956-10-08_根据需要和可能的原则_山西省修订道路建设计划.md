    Based on the Principles of Need and Possibility
    Shanxi Province Revises Road Construction Plan
    (Our Dispatch) Taiyuan—Shanxi Province recently revised its 1956 local road construction plan. The new plan reduces the construction mileage by 64.7% compared to the original plan. The remaining construction tasks will be completed in phases over the next two to three years based on needs and possibilities.
    Most of Shanxi Province is mountainous, and transportation is very inconvenient. The broad masses urgently demand a change in this situation. Especially after the high tide of agricultural cooperation, the demand for building county and township roads is even more pressing. However, some areas lack thorough investigation and research, disregarding needs and possibilities and wanting to accomplish in one go what should be done over several years. This has led to the phenomenon of the 1956 local road construction plan, formulated this spring, being too ambitious. Individual counties even proposed unrealistic demands such as building highways in every township and having cars go to every township. According to these plans, the province would need to build more than 10,000 kilometers of simple highways, cart roads, and pack animal roads this year, mobilizing two to three million labor days from the people. This would inevitably increase the burden on the labor force of agricultural cooperatives and affect agricultural production. At the same time, based on the actual implementation in the first half of the year, due to the large task, short time, insufficient technical strength, and difficulties in material allocation, the impracticality of the original plan has become increasingly apparent. From January to August this year, only 1,260 kilometers of various roads were built, accounting for about 13% of the original plan. Completing the remaining 87% of the construction tasks after the autumn harvest will be fundamentally impossible.
    In view of the above situation, the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee and the Provincial Department of Transportation sent people to various places in June and July to conduct inspections, and instructed all localities to revise the plan based on the principles of need and possibility. The local People's Committees also re-examined and prioritized projects, solicited mass opinions, and revised the original plan. Routes that are not currently urgently needed or for which there is no capacity to build were all postponed. Finally, it was determined that 3,583 kilometers of various local roads would be built this year, a reduction of 64.7% compared to the original plan. (Zhao Junlun)

    根据需要和可能的原则
    山西省修订道路建设计划
    本报讯　山西省最近重新修订了1956年修建地方道路的计划。新订计划的修建里程比原计划缩减了64.7％，所余的修建任务，将根据需要和可能，在今后二、三年内分期完成。
    山西省大部是山区，交通十分不便，广大群众迫切要求改变这种情况，尤其是农业合作化高潮以后，要求修建县乡道路更为迫切。但有些地区缺乏周密的调查研究，不顾需要和可能想把几年办完的事情一举办成，因而造成今春制定的1956年修建地方道路计划偏多偏大的现象，个别县甚至提出乡乡修公路，乡乡通汽车的不切实际的要求。根据这些计划，全省今年即须修建简易公路、大车路和驮运路一万余公里，动用民工二、三百万个工日，这样势必加大农业社劳动力的负担，影响农业生产。同时，根据上半年实际执行情况来看，由于任务大、时间短、技术力量不足和材料调拨困难，日益显露了原计划的不切合实际。今年一至八月份只修建各种道路一千二百六十公里，占原计划的13％左右，所余87％的修建任务，放在秋收后去完成，将根本没有可能。
    根据上述情况，山西省人民委员会和省交通厅早在六、七月份，即派人分赴各地进行检查，并指示各地根据需要和可能的原则重新修订计划。各地人民委员会也经过重新审查排队，征求群众意见，修订了原计划，对当前不十分需要或没有力量修建的路线，一律推迟，最后确定今年修建各种地方道路三千五百八十三公里，较原计划减少了64.7％。　　　（赵俊伦）
