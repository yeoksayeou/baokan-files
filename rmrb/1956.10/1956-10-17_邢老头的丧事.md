    Old Xing's Funeral

    On August 6th, Xing Yulin, a feeder at the Happiness Road Agricultural Cooperative in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, unfortunately passed away due to illness. This fifty-nine-year-old man had no one at home except for a married daughter. After he joined the cooperative last winter, the cooperative assigned him to be a feeder based on his physical condition. When the members heard that Old Xing had become the cooperative's feeder, they all happily said, "It's right to let him take care of the livestock!"

    The old man cherished the cooperative's draught animals as if they were his own. Every day, he drove the livestock out to graze early in the morning and only returned at sunset. He never complained of hardship. Last winter, two horses were worn out from hauling wood and were so thin they could barely walk. But under his diligent care, they quickly regained their condition and were able to work. One day at the end of July, Old Xing suddenly felt a little unwell. But he didn't say a word for four or five days and continued to graze the livestock as usual. Later, the fact that Old Xing was sick was learned by cooperative member Zhao Chengjin. He ran to the cooperative that night and reported it to the cooperative's leaders. By the time the cooperative learned of the news, Old Xing was already bedridden. The cooperative director sent someone to the Xin Zhan Health Clinic to fetch a doctor. Five or six cooperative members were guarding Old Xing's side.

    Old Xing's illness grew more and more severe! The next morning, the cooperative hurriedly sent him to the Xin Zhan Health Clinic for hospitalization in a rubber-wheeled cart. But it didn't help. That very evening, Old Xing died at the health clinic. The news of this misfortune spread to the cooperative, and the members felt deeply saddened! In order to bury Old Xing, the cooperative took out fifty yuan from the public welfare fund to buy a red coffin and a set of clothes. But when the time came for the encoffining, according to the local farmers' customs, the eldest son should hold the head and the second son should hold the feet. But Old Xing only had one daughter, who was far away and couldn't come immediately. At this moment, the cooperative director, Han En, stepped forward and held the head, and the deputy director, Chi Dianwen, Song Jun, and several other cooperative cadres held the feet, and placed Old Xing's body into the coffin. The funeral and burial took place that same day.

    After seeing these facts, more than twenty elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed members of the cooperative were deeply moved. Old Lady Bian said, "Joining the advanced cooperative is even more considerate than having our own children. From now on, we don't have to worry about not having sons or daughters!"

    邢老头的丧事
    8月6日，吉林省蛟河县幸福之路农业社的饲养员邢玉林，不幸因病逝世了。这个五十九岁的老头，家里除有一个已出门子的姑娘外，就再没有别的人了。他在去年冬天入社以后，社里按照他的身体情况，分配他做饲养员。社员们听到邢老头做了社里的饲养员，都高兴地说：“让这把手放牲口，没错！”
    老头爱护社里的耕畜如同爱护自己一样。他每天老早就把牲口赶出去放，日落才归来。从来也没有叫过苦。去冬有两匹马因拉木头拉垮了，瘦的连道都不能走。但在他的辛勤喂养下，很快就复膘能干活了。7月底的一天，邢老头忽然觉得心里有些不大舒服。但他一连四、五天也没吱声，仍然照常放牧牲口。后来，邢老头生病的事被社员赵成金知道了。他连夜跑到社里，向社的领导干部作了汇报。当社里知道这个消息以后，邢老头已卧病不起了。社主任打发人搭黑到新站卫生所去接大夫。在邢老头的身边，有五、六个社员守护着。
    邢老头的病，越来越厉害了！在第二天的早晨，社里就急忙用胶皮车把他送到新站卫生所去住院治疗。但也没有见效。就在当天晚上，邢老头死在卫生所了。这个不幸的消息传到合作社以后，社员们深感悲痛！社里为了安葬邢老头，从公益金中取出五十元钱，买了一口红色棺材、一套衣服。但在入殓时，按照当地农民的习惯，应该由大儿子抱头部、二儿子抱脚。而邢老头只有一个姑娘，离的又远，一时也来不了。这时，社主任韩恩上前抱住了头部，副主任迟殿文、宋君和其他几个社干部抱住了脚，把邢老头的尸体装入棺内。当天，就出殡安葬了。
    社里的二十多户老弱孤寡社员看到这些事实以后，深受感动。边老太婆说：“入了高级社，比亲儿亲女照顾的还周到。今后不用再担心没儿没女了！”
