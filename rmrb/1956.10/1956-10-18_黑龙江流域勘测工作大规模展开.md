Xinhua News Agency, Harbin Electric Report　Large-scale surveying and scientific exploration work in the Heilongjiang River Basin has already begun. On the banks of the Heilongjiang River and in the Greater Khingan Mountains, there are now ten survey (exploration) teams for hydropower, forestry, railways, geology, land, etc., and two scientific expedition teams for animals and plants, working intensely.

　　On the nearly 2,000-li section of the upper Heilongjiang River, Chinese and Soviet hydropower survey and design experts, after a month of on-site investigation, have selected five suitable dam sites for hydropower station construction from fourteen potential sites. Currently, two survey headquarters (large teams) from China and the Soviet Union for the Heilongjiang survey have established two survey work sites. On the left bank of the river, three huge drilling rigs erected by the Soviet geological exploration team are operating day and night. On the right bank of the river, the Chinese geological exploration team is installing drilling rigs transported from Beijing on a mountaintop across the river from the Soviet drilling rigs. This winter, Chinese and Soviet geological exploration team members will brave the severe cold of minus 50 degrees Celsius to jointly conduct ice-based riverbed drilling work.

　　In the Greater Khingan Mountains, the Forestry Department's First and Second Survey Teams for Forest Resources, which survey forest resources, have traversed most of the mountain range since 1953. In coordination with the Forestry Department's aerial survey team, they have completed forest management surveys of millions of hectares, and have divided forest management areas, providing valuable data for forest management and development. The Railway Ministry's 501st and 502nd Survey Headquarters, which entered the Greater Khingan Mountains in March this year, have surveyed two railway lines running through the Greater Khingan Mountains in the vast forest for half a year. Currently, the survey team members are conducting the final detailed survey work. The 118th and 147th Exploration Teams of the Ministry of Geology, which explore underground mineral resources, have also discovered many mineral signs of ferrous and non-ferrous metals in the Greater Khingan Mountains. On the river valley plains of the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains, the Fourth Survey Headquarters of the Heilongjiang Provincial Construction Team has surveyed 1.4 million hectares of arable land. The animal and plant survey teams conducting scientific explorations have also discovered valuable medicinal materials such as ergot, gentian, and astragalus in the mountainous area near Mohe in the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River.

    黑龙江流域勘测工作大规模展开
    新华社哈尔滨电　黑龙江流域的勘测和科学考察工作已经大规模地展开了。在黑龙江畔和大兴安岭中，现在已有水电、森林、铁路、地质、土地等十个勘测（勘探队和动物、植物两个科学考察队在紧张地工作。
    在黑龙江上游近两千里的江道上，中、苏两国的水电勘测设计专家们经过一个月的踏勘，已经从十四个比较坝址中选定了五个适宜建设水电站的坝址。现在，中国和苏联的两个黑龙江勘测总（大）队已经建立了两个勘测工地。在江的左岸，苏联地质勘探队架设的三台巨大钻机，正在日夜不停地转动着。在江的右岸，中国地质勘探队在和苏联钻机隔江相对的山顶上，安装着从北京运来的钻机。今年冬天，中、苏两国的地质勘探队员们将冒着零下五十多度的严寒，共同进行冰上河床的钻探工作。
    在大兴安岭中，勘测森林富源的林业部森林调查第一、第二大队，从1953年以来已经走遍了大半个山岭。他们在林业部航空测量队的配合下，完成了数百万公顷的森林经理调查，并且划分了森林经营区域，为管理和开发森林提供了宝贵的资料。今年3月进入大兴安岭的铁道部五零一和五零二两个勘测总队，半年来在茫茫的林海中测出了两条纵贯大兴安岭的铁路线。现在勘测队员们正在进行最后的定测工作。探寻地下矿藏的地质部一一八和一四七两个勘探队，也已经在大兴安岭中发现了很多黑金属和有色金属的矿苗。在大、小兴安岭的河谷平原上，黑龙江省工地第四勘测总队已经测出一百四十万公顷可耕地。进行科学考察的动物、植物考察队，在黑龙江上游漠河附近的山区里也发现了麦角、龙胆草、黄芪等珍贵的药材。
