Provisions of the State Council on Several Issues in the Wage Reform of New Joint State-Private Enterprises
(Adopted at the 39th Plenary Meeting of the State Council on October 12, 1956)

After the implementation of industry-wide joint state-private ownership in private enterprises across the country, the nature of the enterprises has undergone fundamental changes, becoming new joint state-private enterprises. The labor enthusiasm of employees has generally soared. Over the past six months, the production and business operations of new joint state-private enterprises have greatly improved. However, the original chaotic and unreasonable wage conditions are hindering further increases in production and the implementation of socialist management principles. In order to change the chaotic and unreasonable wage conditions in new joint state-private enterprises and gradually establish a socialist wage system, the State Council has decided to conduct a wage reform in the second half of this year for new joint state-private enterprises that have already fixed shares and interest. Furthermore, based on the principle of gradually improving the lives of employees on the basis of developing production and increasing labor productivity, and taking into account the production, business operations, costs, and financial feasibility of enterprises, the wage levels of workers, staff, and private personnel with relatively low current wage待遇 should be appropriately increased. Now, the following provisions are made regarding several issues in the wage reform:

I. On the Guiding Principles of Wage Reform

The wage standards and wage system of new joint state-private enterprises should gradually align with those of state-owned enterprises in the same region, of the same nature, and of similar scale. If the current wage standards of workers, staff, and private personnel in new joint state-private enterprises are higher than the wage standards of local state-owned enterprises of the same type, they should not be reduced; if they are lower, they should be gradually increased in stages based on the enterprise's production, business operations, and actual possibilities. The portion of the current wage standards that is higher than the newly determined wage standards should be retained. The retained wages should be gradually offset in the future as wage standards are raised and promotions are made.

The wage system of new joint state-private enterprises should be reasonably adjusted according to the principle of "to each according to his work," but it should also proceed from actual possibilities, take appropriate steps, and gradually achieve uniformity and rationality. Attention should be paid to absorbing the rational elements of the original wage system. During this wage reform, the goal is for the internal wage system of enterprises to be basically unified and rational, and for the wide disparities in wages between industries, within industries, and between different types of personnel to be somewhat improved.

II. On the Wage System for Workers in Industrial, Construction, and Transportation Enterprises

(1) Wage Standards. Wage standards should be formulated with reference to the wage standards of local state-owned enterprises of the same type, based on the enterprise's equipment, technical level, and current wage standards. Two or three wage standards can be implemented in the same industry in the same region. Enterprises with conditions roughly the same as those of local state-owned enterprises of the same type can adopt the wage standards of local state-owned enterprises; enterprises with poorer conditions should have wage standards lower than those of local state-owned enterprises; individual enterprises with high conditions can stipulate higher wage standards. If there are no state-owned enterprises of the same type locally, wage standards can be formulated with reference to the wage standards of state-owned enterprises of a similar nature. A small number of workers with special skills can be individually stipulated with higher wages or given technical allowances.

(2) Wage Grade System. In principle, the wage grade system for workers in new joint state-private enterprises should also align with that of state-owned enterprises. If there are indeed difficulties in implementation, half a grade can be added to certain grades or in the middle of each grade as needed. In some light industrial enterprises, where the internal technical differences of certain types of work are not large and there is no direct promotion relationship between the types of work, wages can be stipulated according to the work (i.e., no grades are divided within the types of work, i.e., independent wage system).

The number of wage grades and the size of the difference between each grade in various industries should mainly be determined according to the complexity of the technology. When stipulating the wage grade system for various industries, a distinction should be made between mechanized production, semi-mechanized production, and manual production, because the degree of technical complexity is different, and the number of wage grades and the difference between each grade should also be different.

Technical grade standards should generally refer to those of state-owned enterprises, but must be realistic. If there are no state-owned enterprises of the same type locally, technical grade standards should be formulated independently. If there are still difficulties in doing so, the method of "technical stationing" can be adopted to evaluate the wage grades of workers.

(3) Piece-Rate Wage System and Bonus Wage System. The old piece-rate wage system should be reformed. In general, piece-rate unit prices should be re-stipulated based on the newly determined wage standards and labor quotas, and a system of regularly reviewing and revising quotas should be established. If the income from the original piece-rate wages is much higher than the newly determined hourly wage standard, a piece-rate wage standard can be implemented with reference to state-owned enterprises of the same type, or appropriate consideration can be given to the quota. Various unreasonable bonus wage systems should be actively replaced with reasonable bonus systems; imperfect bonus systems should be improved; and bonus indicators that have become outdated should be revised according to the actual situation.

As for a small number of industrial and transportation enterprises that implement commission or split-account systems, they should be changed to a piece-rate wage system or a hourly bonus wage system.

(4) Apprentices' Regularization and Promotion. A general skills assessment or technical appraisal should be conducted for apprentices, and those who meet the conditions for regularization and promotion should be regularized or promoted. In the future, a system of conducting skills assessments for apprentices every six months should be established.

III. On the Wage System for Commercial Enterprises

(1) Wage System for Pure Commercial Enterprises. The wage standards for new joint state-private commercial enterprises should refer to the wage standards of state-owned commerce if they are reformed by the Ministry of Commerce, and should refer to the wage standards of supply and marketing cooperatives if they are reformed by supply and marketing cooperatives. Several different wage standards can be implemented in the same industry in the same region. For enterprises with current wage standards that are too low, a lower wage standard can be implemented to avoid excessive wage increases at one time, which would affect the enterprise's business operations. Enterprises that operate special commodities, have higher technical and business abilities of employees, and have high current wage standards can stipulate higher wage standards. The processing plants attached to commercial enterprises should formulate their own wage standards and wage system with reference to the wage standards and wage system of local state-owned industries of the same type.

A hourly bonus wage system should be actively established in joint state-private pure commercial enterprises. The original "likin" (local tax), profit-sharing, or commission system should be gradually replaced with a bonus system.

(2) Wage System for Service Industries. For service industries and catering industries that implement commission, split-account, or profit-sharing systems, this system should be preserved, and the proportion of commission and the method of distribution should be improved according to the actual situation.

IV. On the Wage System for Staff and Engineering Technical Personnel

The wage standards for enterprise staff and technical personnel should be stipulated according to the positions they hold. The minimum and maximum wage standards for various positions should generally align with local state-owned enterprises of the same nature and similar scale. Technical personnel with higher technical levels should be given technical allowances; senior technical personnel who have made important contributions to the enterprise should be given special allowances.

V. On the Wage Treatment of Private Personnel

The wage treatment of private personnel should be handled in accordance with the same principles as for the wages of employees. In evaluating wages, in addition to the current position and work ability, their technical ability and management experience should also be fully considered, and their current wage level should be appropriately taken into account.

For small business owners who originally did not have fixed wages, wages should be evaluated based on their current position and work ability, and their original income should be appropriately considered. Family members of small factory and shop owners who originally performed auxiliary labor and have now participated in labor as full laborers can be absorbed as formal staff members and evaluated for wages according to standards. Those who only participate in labor part-time can be paid necessary living expenses on a monthly basis and not included in the on-the-books personnel.

For private personnel such as chairmen, directors, and supervisors who do not hold other positions, the enterprise can pay salaries; if they also hold other positions and originally had travel allowances, the enterprise can continue to pay travel allowances. The staff of the board of directors (such as secretaries, clerks, typists, etc.) should be evaluated according to the wage standards of similar staff in the enterprise.

VI. On Disguised Wages

Disguised wages should be distinguished by nature, handled in order of priority, and specifically handled according to the actual situation of each enterprise. Those that have been canceled should not be restored. Those that are of a welfare nature should be retained, and those with unreasonable methods should be improved. Some disguised wage treatments can be gradually replaced by establishing reasonable systems, and some can be partially or fully incorporated into wage standards. For food expenses that have a relatively large impact on the lives of employees, they should generally be incorporated into wage standards. Enterprises with high current wage standards can partially or fully retain them as amounts, and the system should be canceled.

VII. On Back Pay Based on New Wage Standards

In order to encourage the production enthusiasm of employees, the portion of the new hourly wage standard that is higher than the current wage shall be retroactively paid from July 1, 1956, regardless of the month in which the new wage plan is announced. Enterprises that underwent wage reform before the joint venture should retroactively pay the wage increases due to employee promotions from July 1st during this wage reform. Apprentices who have long been competent as skilled workers should retroactively pay the wage increases due to regularization and promotion from July 1st.

VIII. On the Organization, Leadership, and Timing of Wage Reform

The People's Committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government should formulate wage reform plans for new joint state-private enterprises in their respective regions based on these provisions and submit them to the State Council for approval and implementation. The routine work of wage reform shall be uniformly led by the labor and wage committees or wage reform offices affiliated with the People's Committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government. Major policy and guideline issues should be reported to the State Council in a timely manner, and specific issues can be handled independently.

The wage reform work of new joint state-private enterprises should generally be completed before the end of 1956.

    国务院关于新公私合营企业工资改革中若干问题的规定
    （1956年10月12日国务院全体会议第三十九次会议通过）
    全国各地私营企业实行全行业公私合营以后，企业的性质发生了根本的变化，已成为新的公私合营企业，职工的劳动热情普遍高涨。半年多以来，新公私合营企业的生产、营业情况已有很大改善，但是原有的混乱不合理的工资状况，却障碍着生产的进一步提高和社会主义经营管理原则的贯彻执行。为了改变新公私合营企业中混乱不合理的工资状况，逐步建立起社会主义的工资制度，国务院决定对新公私合营并且已经定股定息的企业的工资制度，在今年下半年进行一次改革，并且根据在发展生产、提高劳动生产率的基础上逐步改善职工生活的原则，考虑到企业生产、营业、成本等方面的情况和财务开支的可能性，适当地提高现行工资待遇比较低的工人、职员和私方人员的工资水平。现在，对工资改革中的若干问题，作如下规定：
    一、关于工资改革的方针问题
    新公私合营企业的工资标准和工资制度，应该逐步向同一地区、性质相同、规模相近的国营企业看齐。新公私合营企业的工人、职员和私方人员的现行工资标准，同当地同类性质的国营企业的工资标准相比较，高了的不减少，低了的根据企业生产、营业情况和实际可能，分期地逐步增加。现行工资标准高于新定工资标准的部分，给予保留。保留的工资，今后应该随着提高工资标准和升级逐步抵消。
    新公私合营企业的工资制度，应该根据按劳付酬的原则进行合理的调整，但又要从实际可能出发，采取适当的步骤，逐步地达到统一合理。对原有的工资制度，要注意吸取其合理的因素。在这次工资改革中，要求企业内部的工资制度能够达到基本上统一合理；行业之间、行业内部以及各类人员之间的工资悬殊的状况能够有所改善。
    二、关于工业、建筑和交通运输企业工人的工资制度问题
    （一）工资标准问题。工资标准，应该根据企业的设备、技术水平和现行工资标准等条件参照当地同类性质的地方国营企业的工资标准制定，在同一地区的同一行业可以实行两种或者三种工资标准。条件与当地同类性质的地方国营企业大致相同的，可以采用地方国营企业的工资标准；条件差的，工资标准应该低于地方国营企业；个别企业条件高的，可以规定较高的工资标准。如果当地没有同类性质的国营企业，可以参照性质相近的国营企业的工资标准制定。少数有特殊技能的工人，可以单独规定较高的工资，或者发给技术津贴。
    （二）工资等级制度问题。新公私合营企业工人的工资等级制度，原则上也应该向国营企业看齐，如果执行确有困难的时候，可以根据需要在某些等级或者每级的中间附加半级。有些轻工业企业，某些工种内部技术差别不大，工种之间又没有直接升级关系，可以按工作规定工资（工种内部不再划分等级，即独立工资制）。
    各行业工资等级数目的多少和各等级之间差额的大小，主要应该根据技术复杂程度来确定。在规定各行业的工资等级制度的时候，应该区别机械化生产、半机械化生产和手工生产，因为技术复杂程度不同，工资等级的数目和各等级之间的差额也应该有所不同。
    技术等级标准一般地应该参照国营企业，但必须切合实际。如果当地没有同类性质的国营企业，应该自行制定技术等级标准。如果这样做还有困难的时候，可以采取“技术站队”的办法来评定工人的工资等级。
    （三）计件工资制和奖励工资制问题。旧的计件工资制应该加以改革。一般应该根据新定的工资标准和劳动定额，重新规定计件单价，并且建立定期审查和修改定额的制度。如果原来计件工资的收入高于新定计时工资标准较多的时候，可以参照同类性质的国营企业实行计件工资标准，或者从定额上给予适当照顾。对各种不合理的奖励工资制度，应该积极地以合理的奖励制度来代替；不够完善的奖励制度，应该加以改进；奖励指标已经落后的，应该根据实际情况加以修改。
    至于实行提成或者拆账制的少数工业企业和交通运输企业，应该改行计件工资制或者计时奖励工资制。
    （四）学徒的转正和升级问题。对学徒应该普遍进行一次考工或者技术鉴定，凡具备转正和升级条件的，一律给予转正或者升级。今后对学徒应该建立每半年考工一次的制度。
    三、关于商业企业的工资制度问题
    （一）纯商业企业的工资制度问题。新公私合营的商业企业的工资标准，由商业部负责改造的，应该参照国营商业的工资标准；由供销合作社负责改造的，应该参照供销合作社的工资标准。在同一地区的同一行业，可以实行几种不同的工资标准：凡现行工资标准过低的企业，为避免一次增加工资过多，影响企业的营业，可以实行较低的工资标准；凡经营特种商品，职工技术、业务能力较高，现行工资标准也高的企业，可以规定较高的工资标准。商业企业附属的加工厂，应该参照当地同类性质的地方国营工业的工资标准和工资制度制定自己的工资标准和工资制度。
    在公私合营的纯商业企业中，应该积极建立计时奖励工资制度。对原有的“厘金”、分红或者提成制度，应该逐步以奖励制度来代替。
    （二）服务业的工资制度问题。对实行提成、拆账或者分红制度的服务业、饮食业，应该保存这种制度，根据实际情况，改进提成的比例和分配的方法。
    四、关于职员和工程技术人员的工资制度问题
    企业职员和技术人员的工资标准应该根据他们所担任的职务来规定。各种职务的最低与最高工资标准，应该大体上向当地性质相同、规模相近的地方国营企业看齐。技术水平较高的技术人员，应该发给技术津贴；对企业有重要贡献的高级技术人员，应该发给特定津贴。
    五、关于私方人员的工资待遇问题
    私方人员的工资待遇，应该按照对职工工资的同样原则处理。在评定工资的时候，除了按照现任的职务和工作能力以外，还要充分考虑到他们的技术能力和经营管理的经验，并且适当照顾他们的现行工资水平。
    对于原来没有固定工资的小业主，应该根据现任职务和工作能力，并且适当考虑他们原来的收入情况来评定工资。小厂店业主的家属，原来担任辅助劳动的，已经做为全劳动力参加劳动的，可以吸收为正式工作人员，按标准评定工资；只有部分时间参加劳动的，可以按月发给必要的生活费用，不列入在册人员。
    对于董事长、董事、监事等私方人员，如果没有兼任其他职务的，可以由企业发给薪金；如果兼有其他职务而原来有车马费的，可以继续由企业发给车马费。董事会的工作人员（如秘书、办事员、打字员等），应该按照企业同类工作人员的工资标准评定。
    六、关于变相工资问题
    对于变相工资应该区别性质、分别先后，并且根据各企业的实际情况具体处理。已经取消的不再恢复。属于福利性质的，应该保留，办法不合理的应该改进。有些变相工资待遇，可以逐步地建立合理的制度来代替，有些可以部分或全部并入工资标准。对于关系职工生活比较大的伙食项目，一般地应该并入工资标准，现行工资标准高的企业，可以部分或全部做为金额保留，制度取消。
    七、关于按新工资标准补发工资问题
    为了鼓舞职工的生产积极性，新的工资方案不论在那一月份宣布，新定计时工资标准高于现行工资的部分，一律从1956年7月1日起补发。合营前经过工资改革的企业，在这次工资改革中，对职工升级应补发的工资从7月1日起补发。早已胜任技术工人工作的学徒，因转正、升级应补发的工资从7月1日起补发。
    八、关于工资改革的组织领导和时间问题
    各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会，应该根据本规定，制定本地区新公私合营企业的工资改革方案，报国务院批准执行。工资改革的经常工作，由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会所属劳动工资委员会或工资改革办公室统一领导进行。遇有重大政策和方针问题，应该及时报告国务院，各项具体问题可以自行处理。
    新公私合营企业的工资改革工作，一般应该在1956年年底以前完成。
