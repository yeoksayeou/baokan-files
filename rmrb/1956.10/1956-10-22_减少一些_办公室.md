    Reduce Some "Offices"
    Zhou Peiting
    To complete a mass movement or central task in a given period, it is necessary to form an office jointly by relevant departments to handle daily work. However, some places now apply this working method too extensively. No matter what work is being done, an office must be established, as if only in this way can its importance be demonstrated. According to statistics from Taigu County, Shanxi Province, there are now more than twenty various offices established, including: "Wage Reform Office," "Grain Purchase Office," "Production Office," "Counter-Revolution Suppression Office," "Private Enterprise Reform Office," "Production Increase Competition Office," "Literacy Campaign Office," "Oil Production Increase Office," "Eliminate the Four Pests Office," "Greening Office," "Implement the Marriage Law Office," "Election Office," "Water Conservancy Census Office," "Disaster Relief Office," "Reconstruction Office," "Household Survey Office"... almost every unit has an "office," and some units even have two or three "offices." Some offices, such as the Production Office, Production Disaster Relief Office, and Production Increase Competition Office, are of the same nature and are redundant. The "Eliminate the Four Pests" work is actually the work of the county health department, and the cadres of the "Eliminate the Four Pests Office" are still those two comrades from the health department.
    Establishing too many unnecessary offices creates complicated procedures and multiple leaders below, which leads to the development of bureaucracy and red tape. Reducing some "offices" and doing more practical work is a problem that should be paid attention to.

### 减少一些“办公室”

    减少一些“办公室”
    周培庭
    为了完成一个时期的群众性的运动或中心工作，由有关几个部门共同组成办公室办理日常工作，是必要的。但是，现在有些地方把这种工作方法运用的过于广泛了，不管做什么工作，都要成立办公室，好像只有这样才能显示出重要性。根据山西省太谷县的统计，现在成立的各种各样的办公室就有二十多个，计有：“工资改革办公室”、“粮食征购办公室”、“生产办公室”、“肃反办公室”、“私改办公室”、“增产竞赛办公室”、“扫盲办公室”、“油脂增产办公室”、“除四害办公室”、“绿化办公室”、“贯彻婚姻法办公室”、“选举办公室”、“水利普查办公室”、“救灾办公室”、“转建办公室”、“家计调查办公室”……，几乎每个单位都有个“办公室”，甚至一个单位成立两、三个“办公室”；有些办公室如生产办公室、生产救灾办公室、增产竞赛办公室是同类性质的，重复的。“除四害”实际是县卫生科的工作，“除四害办公室”的干部也还是卫生科的那两个同志。
    成立过多的、不必要的办公室，就造成了下边的手续繁杂，领导多头，使得文牍主义和官僚主义也随着发展。减少些“办公室”，多做些实际工作，实在是应当注意的一个问题。
