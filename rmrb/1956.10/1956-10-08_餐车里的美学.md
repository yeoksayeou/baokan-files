    Aesthetics in the Dining Car
    Xiao Qian
    Before dawn, a painter in a short blue leather coat went to the toilet and peeked into the dining car. Back in the carriage, he whispered, with the excitement of someone who had discovered a treasure, to two other painters, one in a blue cotton-padded coat and the other in a suit, "Hey, they have late-night snacks." Actually, it was almost five o'clock, so it could only be called "early morning snacks." So the three of them, rubbing their dry and stinging eyes, walked into the dining car.
    Here, the walls were white, and the lighting was somewhat brighter than in the carriages, instantly reducing the fatigue of the journey.
    Before the ordered noodle soup arrived, the painter in the leather coat was particularly enthusiastic and suggested buying a bottle of wine. Logically speaking, it wasn't really a time to drink, but the autumn nights in the border region were already quite cold, and the train was speeding along in the strong September wind, with the Mongolian wind constantly whistling in from all the seams, so no one objected to this sudden suggestion.
    As the train traveled, the darkness outside the window gradually dissolved into gray. Lifting the curtain, one could even see a yellowish-brown riverbed below a slope made of cobblestones – although it was only a small stream, the riverbed itself was not narrow. Staring further into the distance, one could clearly see some crops. After a while, a magnificent mountain emerged from the silver-gray mist.
    "Mi Fu truly deserves to be a master!" exclaimed the painter in the blue cotton-padded coat. "The morning mist is like a long white ribbon, horizontally across the mountainside. Look! The place where the clouds and mountains meet is exactly like shaded ink marks!"
    The painter in the suit had a Jiangzhe accent. He felt that there was still something lacking. "If this river wasn't so muddy, and were clearer, that would be great!"
    This opinion was immediately refuted. The opposing view was: if you were to move the small bridges and flowing water of Jiangnan to the border region, it wouldn't be typical.
    At this moment, the waiter brought over the steaming hot noodle soup. But how untimely he was! No one was in the mood to eat noodles, because a miracle had appeared outside the window.
    Behind the clouds and mist, another peak suddenly emerged, its tip gilded by the morning sun to a color brighter than gold, with sharp edges and corners, set against the surrounding gray clouds and brown mountains, a brilliance that truly existed only in dreams or myths.
    Faced with this spectacle, the painters, after admiring it, began to discuss. One thought it should be painted with ocher yellow with a slight touch of red, another advocated using ochre yellow, and finally, the painter in the short blue coat said with great certainty, "In my opinion, only realgar can express it."
    "Alas, you're all wasting your brains," said the painter in the blue cotton-padded coat with boundless emotion. "If you painted such a mountain peak in a patch of gray clouds, I guarantee the critics wouldn't approve. They would definitely say: this isn't Chinese painting, this is Western painting!"
    "But old man Qi Baishi really dares to use color! The critics can't do anything about him!" retorted the painter in the suit, his argument sounding somewhat weaker.
    "Because nature dares to use color," the painter in the short leather coat quickly came to his support, still staring at the increasingly distant and fading spectacle in a daze.
    "But, I ask you," the painter in the blue cotton-padded coat said unconvinced, "theory is theory, but when you go back, would you dare to paint like that?"
    This was clearly a challenge, but no one immediately stepped forward to accept it. It swirled above their heads like a lingering smoke ring.
    At this moment, the waiter walked over politely and said:
    "Comrades, eat quickly, we're about to clean the dining car and change shifts!"
    Looking out the window, most of the brilliant colors in the distance had already been soaked into gray by the clouds and mist, leaving only a few small patches shimmering faintly behind the smoke, as if proclaiming the existence of light, and seemingly beckoning to the three painters in the train from afar: be brave, paint me!
            September 5th, in Xilinhot

    餐车里的美学
    萧乾
    天还没亮，穿青色短皮大衣的画家上厕所，顺便朝餐车里探了探头。回到车厢，他小声地、然而却像是发现了宝山那么又惊又喜地告诉穿蓝棉袄和穿西装的两位画家说：“喂，有宵夜吃。”其实，已经快五点啦，有也只能说是“早点”。三个人于是就揉着又干又辣的眼睛，走进了餐车。
    这里，墙是白色的，灯光比车厢里多少总亮些，旅途的倦意登时杀减了不少。
    叫的汤面还没来，穿皮大衣的画家兴致特别高，提议买一瓶葡萄酒。论理说，这可不像个喝酒的时辰，可是塞外的秋夜已经够凉的了，列车又是在九月的劲风里奔驰着，蒙古的风不断嗖嗖地从四面缝隙袭来，所以谁也没反对这个突兀的提议。
    随着列车的行进，窗外那片漆黑渐渐溶成灰色了。掀开窗帘，甚至可以看到卵石垒成的坡道下面一条土黄色的河滩——虽然只是一条细流，河床本身却不算窄。再往远处凝视，分明还可以看见一些庄稼。再过一阵，银灰色的烟雾里钻出了一个奇丽的山峦。
    “米芾真不愧是位大师！”穿蓝棉袄的画家慨叹说。“晨烟就是像条白色的长带，横在山的半腰。瞧！云山衔接的地方不正是像阴了的墨迹吗！”
    穿西装的画家口音是江浙的。他觉得还有些美中不足。“要是这道河不是这么泥浆子似的，再清澈一些多好呵！”
    这意见马上受到了批驳。反对的意见是：要是把江南那种小桥流水搬到塞外来，就不典型了。
    这时候，服务员把热腾腾的汤面端上来了。可是他来的有多么不是时候！谁也没心吃面，因为窗外出现了奇迹。
    云雾后面，忽然又钻出了个峰尖，这峰尖给朝阳镀得比金子还要亮，有棱有角，衬着四下的灰云和褐色的山峦，灿烂得真是只有梦境或者神话里才会有的色彩。
    画家们面对这片奇景，赞叹之余，就议论开了。一位认为该用鹅黄再微微加点红，一位主张用赭黄，最后穿青色短大衣的画家很有把握地说：“我看，只有雄黄才能把它表现出来。”
    “唉，你们都是白费脑筋，”穿蓝棉袄的画家带着无限感慨地说。“要是你在一片灰灰的云朵里，画上这么个山头，我管保批评家不会答应的。他们一定会说：这不是国画，这是西洋画！” 
    “可是齐白石这老头子真敢用色！批评家也拿他没办法！”穿西服的反驳说，听起来论据显着弱了些。
    “因为大自然是敢用色的。”穿短皮衣的画家赶紧来支援说，一面仍然望着那片越来越远、越淡的奇景出着神。
    “可是，我问你们，”穿蓝棉袄的画家不服气地说，“理论是理论，你们回去敢这么画吗？”
    这显然是个挑战，可是并没有人马上出来应战。它像个不散的烟圈儿一般，在他们头上旋转着。
    这时候，服务员彬彬有礼地走过来说：
    “同志们，快吃吧，我们马上就要打扫餐车，交班啦！”
    由窗口探头一看，远方那片灿烂的色彩大部分已经给云雾浸染成灰色了，只残剩下几小块在烟雾后面隐约闪烁着，像是昭示着光明的存在，又仿佛遥遥地向列车里的三位画家召唤着说：勇敢点儿，把我画出来吧。
