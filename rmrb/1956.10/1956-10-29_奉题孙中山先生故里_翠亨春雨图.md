    Inscribed with Respect: Painting of Spring Rain in Cuiheng, Hometown of Mr. Sun Yat-sen
    Ma Xulun
    Even if not a tall tree, it still grows in Shen; It is believed that a true person has his own truth.
    Since the dragon god went to bring rain,  Still left the green-black to dye the mountain's wrinkles.
    Willows, gentle breeze, apricot rain day, The lost bow hangs empty on the blue cloud peak.
    I once heard the last words with true shame,  Unable to save the raging waves crashing on the sea's edge.
    Respectfully inscribed on two poems about the painting "Spring Rain in Cuiheng, Hometown of Mr. Sun Yat-sen," I have forgotten the year and month, probably more than ten years ago, hence the last sentence. This year is Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ninetieth birthday. I suffer from brain disease and cannot think, so I write this to express my feelings.
    September, 1956

    奉题孙中山先生故里
    翠亨春雨图
    马叙伦
    纵非乔木亦生申　是信真人自有真
    一自神龙行雨去　尚留青黛染山皴
    杨柳轻风杏雨天　遗弓空挂碧云巅
    曾闻末命真惭愧　不挽狂澜踆海边
    右奉题孙中山先生故里翠亨春雨图两首，已忘年月，大约是十余年前所作，故有末句。今年先生九十岁，余苦脑疾，不能运思，遂书此以当怀感。
