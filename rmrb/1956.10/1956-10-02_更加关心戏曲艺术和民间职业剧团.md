Comrade Zhou Weizhi, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Art Affairs, Ministry of Culture, made a speech:
	I fully agree with the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping.
	Currently, there are more than 2,000 folk professional troupes across the country, with approximately 150,000 artists participating in these troupes. This is the largest artistic force in our country today. I would like to express some opinions on this issue.
	Not long ago, the Kunsu Opera Troupe of Zhejiang performed the Kunqu opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash", causing a sensation in Shanghai and Beijing, and now it is famous throughout the country. The performance of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" has a positive helping effect on our country's socialist construction and on our improvement of work style. Now everyone says that the Kunqu opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash" is good. However, Kunqu opera was once considered to be something lying in a coffin. Several Kunqu opera troupes had been displaced and scattered, and some had changed careers. The artists had struggled for many years to preserve this only Kunqu opera troupe. The adaptation and performance of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" had also undergone extremely arduous efforts under the leadership of the local party and government. This experience tells us that our artistic heritage is very rich and precious. As long as we can resolutely correct the erroneous attitude of underestimating the national artistic heritage, many things that have been forgotten or destroyed can shine with amazing brilliance.
	Kunqu opera is just one of hundreds of opera genres in the country, and "Fifteen Strings of Cash" is just one of thousands of excellent opera repertoires. We must refer to the above experience and pay more attention to the issues of national opera art and folk professional troupes. Folk professional troupes are a very large team with long-term artistic practical experience. It is more than ten times larger than state-owned troupes. It includes all opera genres in the country, and the artistic level of many folk professional troupes is very high and loved by the broad masses of people. These troupes are distributed throughout the country and perform in remote rural areas. Every day, there are one to two million viewers, and they have the closest connection with the people. Since liberation, under the guidance of the central government's general policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom," and under the direct leadership and help of the party and government in various places, many folk professional troupes have improved their professional skills, and opera artists have also made great progress politically and artistically. They play a significant role in educating the masses and meeting the needs of the masses' cultural and entertainment life. Most of them have received social attention, and their lives have also improved compared to before liberation.
	However, the situation of many folk professional troupes is still not very good, and some are even very bad. Some artists have very low incomes and live in very difficult conditions. In order to increase income, many troupes desperately increase performances, and the actors are tired. The voices of many main actors have become hoarse. In some places, artists are discriminated against in terms of personality, and no one cares about them politically. Some cadres even verbally abuse artists, arbitrarily bully and make things difficult, such as stipulating that troupes must give away tickets, and if they are not allowed to watch "free shows," the whole troupe must reflect; actors must "pay respects" to local officials, otherwise they cannot perform smoothly. Individual cultural center cadres even privately sentenced artists to three months of control. In many places, traditional repertoires have been largely discontinued, and the repertoires performed are becoming increasingly scarce. Some famous actors can now only perform three or four plays. Many opera genres have no successors. If they are not supported, there is a danger of "extinction."
	The reasons for the above-mentioned difficulties and problems are complex, but the shortcomings and errors in the work of the cultural departments are the main reasons for making the problem more and more serious. We often only manage state-owned troupes and do not manage folk professional troupes. We have never conducted a comprehensive arrangement and active leadership of folk professional troupes, and we have always lacked serious consideration and practical solutions to the difficulties, demands, and opinions raised by artists. This is precisely a manifestation of our bureaucratic style of lacking a comprehensive perspective and mass concept.
	In the future, we must strengthen leadership and make comprehensive arrangements for folk professional troupes. The first thing to do is to try our best to improve the working and living conditions of the troupes. This year, with the approval of the State Council, 5 million yuan has been allocated to subsidize those troupes that are in economic difficulties. We must do this work well. We must greatly strengthen the professional leadership of folk professional troupes, help them constantly enrich their repertoires and improve the quality of performances, help artists to further their studies, help artists improve their political awareness and cultural level, and regularly eliminate illiteracy; pay attention to cultivating and absorbing artists into the Party and the League. Rely on artists and take various measures to train students in various opera genres.
	Folk professional troupes have a very close relationship with the political and cultural life of the people. If the leadership is not good and the handling is improper, it will not only affect the development of the art industry, but also affect the lives of artists, causing serious social problems. It is hoped that party committees at all levels will strengthen their leadership over folk professional troupes, supervise and inspect the work of government cultural departments in this regard, and help them solve difficulties in their work.

### 更加关心戏曲艺术和民间职业剧团

    更加关心戏曲艺术和民间职业剧团
    文化部艺术事业管理局副局长　周巍峙同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志、周恩来同志和邓小平同志的报告。
    现在全国有民间职业剧团二千多个，参加这些剧团的艺人约十五万人。这是我国今天最大的一支艺术队伍。我现在就这个问题，发表一点意见。
    不久以前，浙江的昆苏剧团演出了昆曲“十五贯”，轰动上海，轰动北京，现在已经闻名全国。“十五贯”的演出对我国的社会主义建设，对我们改进工作作风，都有积极的帮助作用。现在谁都说昆曲“十五贯”好。但是昆曲曾经被人认为是已经躺在棺材里的东西。几个昆曲剧团曾经颠沛流离，散的散了，转业的转业了；艺人们为了保存这唯一的昆曲剧团曾经挣扎了多年，“十五贯”的改编和演出也曾经在当地党政的领导下经过了极其艰苦的努力。这一段经验告诉我们，我国的艺术遗产是十分丰富和宝贵的，只要我们能坚决纠正轻视民族艺术遗产的错误态度，许多被人遗忘或者摧残过的东西，就能放出令人惊异的光彩。
    昆剧只是全国几百种剧种中的一种”，“十五贯”只是千百个优秀戏曲剧目中的一个。我们必须参照上述的经验，更加关心和注意民族戏曲艺术和民间职业剧团的问题。民间职业剧团是一支极大的有长期艺术实践经验的队伍，它比国营剧团多十几倍。它包括全国所有的剧种，很多民间职业剧团的艺术水平很高，为广大人民所热爱。这些剧团分布全国各地，深入穷乡僻壤进行演出，每天的观众有一、二百万人，他们和人民群众有着最密切的联系。解放以来，在中央“百花齐放”总方针的指导下，在各地党政的直接领导与帮助下，很多民间职业剧团在业务上有了提高，戏曲艺人在政治上、艺术上也有了很大的进步，他们在教育群众，满足群众文娱生活的要求方面起着重大的作用。他们多数受到社会的重视，生活也比解放前有了改善。
    但是，现在还有不少民间职业剧团的境况还不很好，有的甚至很不好。有些艺人收入很少，生活十分困难。为了增加收入，很多剧团拚命增加演出，演员劳累，许多主要演员嗓子唱哑了。有些地方的艺人在人格上受歧视，政治上没有人关心。有些干部对艺人甚至当面辱骂，任意欺侮，刁难，如规定剧团要送票，不让看“白戏”就要全团反省；演员到地方要“拜客”，否则就不能顺利演出。个别文化馆干部还私自判处艺人管制三个月。在不少地方，传统剧目大量被停演，上演剧目一天天贫乏，有些名演员现在只能演三、四出戏了。许多剧种后继无人，如不加以扶持，就有“绝种”的危险。
    造成上述困难和问题的原因是复杂的，而文化部门工作上的缺点和错误却是促使问题越拖越严重的主要原因。我们常常只管国营剧团，不管民间职业剧团；对民间职业剧团一直没有进行全面的安排和积极的领导，对艺人提出的困难、要求和意见一直缺乏认真的考虑与切实的解决。这正是我们缺乏全面观点、群众观念的官僚主义的表现。
    今后，我们对民间职业剧团一定加强领导，全面安排，首先是尽力改善剧团的工作与生活条件。今年经国务院批准拨款五百万元，将补助那些在经济上有困难的剧团，我们必须做好这项工作。我们必须大大加强对民间职业剧团的业务领导，帮助他们不断地丰富上演剧目，提高演出质量，帮助艺人进修；帮助艺人提高政治认识和文化水平，定期扫除文盲；注意培养与吸收艺人入党、入团。依靠艺人，采取各种办法培养各剧种的学员。
    民间职业剧团和人民的政治、文化生活有着极密切的联系，领导不好，处理不当，不但会影响艺术事业的发展，而且会影响艺人生活，造成严重的社会问题。希望各级党委加强对民间职业剧团的领导，督促与检查政府文化部门这方面的工作，帮助他们解决工作上的困难。
