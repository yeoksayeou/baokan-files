Increase Road Building Machinery for New Northwest Lines
Chen Yi, Director of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways

The task of building new railways in the Northwest region is undertaken by the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. Over the past six years, it has constructed 1,307 kilometers of railway trunk and branch lines in Gansu Province. Building railways in the Northwest region presents naturally difficult environmental and construction conditions. For example, the Lanxin Railway has to pass through the Wuqiao Ridge, which is 3,000 meters above sea level and covered with snow all year round. Outside Jiayuguan, there are mostly endless Gobi deserts and grasslands, uninhabited for hundreds of kilometers. The railway has to pass through areas with very complex geological conditions such as shifting sands, alkaline lands, swamps, and gypsum areas. This inevitably brings many unexpected difficulties to the construction, especially the lack of water and the difficulty in building houses. Engineering water and drinking water for the workers have to be transported by trucks, from as close as 10 to 20 kilometers to as far as over 100 kilometers. Tens of thousands of railway construction workers are fighting in such areas, and the difficulties and hardships of their working and living conditions are indeed incomparable to those in general areas. In addition, new line projects are mobile and dispersed, which is obviously different from factories and mines fixed at one point. Workers move along hundreds of kilometers of lines for many years. Whether it is a section team or on-site workers, they have to move frequently. The faster the project progresses, the greater the mobility. This feature creates great difficulties in the lives of workers. Because our family bases have not been fully built, the families of workers still live with the workers on-site, which further increases the difficulties in terms of life supply and housing. However, these difficulties have not intimidated the working class, who have the heroic spirit of "making high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way." When there were no houses to live in, they automatically dug caves and holes along the mountains, and built sheds with reed mats; when there was no water to use, they built flood ponds, dug cellars to store water, used camels to carry water, and used trucks and horse-drawn carts to haul water from dozens of miles away; when there were no green vegetables, and night blindness occurred, they tried to eat mutton liver soup, sprout their own soybeans, and make tofu. However, we cannot let workers work in such harsh environments for a long time. We have a responsibility to gradually improve this situation.

Gradually improving the material and cultural life of workers on the basis of developing production and increasing labor productivity is one of the basic policies of our Party. In the past few years, although we have done a lot of work to care for the lives of workers, especially the housing of workers' families, generally speaking, our First Engineering Bureau is far from adequately implementing the Party's policy. In the past few years, the state's investment and enterprise bonuses have been used to build a total of 3,547 houses for workers' families in the base and on-site, accounting for 24% of the existing number of family households (on-site railway construction workers have temporary houses). Obviously, the housing for workers is still not adequately resolved. In this case, problems such as children's schooling are difficult to take care of. Therefore, some workers reflected, "After sweeping away the old blind, we have to sweep away the young blind." Some family members said, "Agricultural cooperation in the countryside is in full swing, and doing railway work is not as good as going home to farm." This shows that there is still a bureaucratic style of leadership in our engineering bureau that does not care about the vital interests of the workers. In the future, in addition to our own concern for the vital lives of the workers, we also hope that the state can provide strong support in the investment of workers' family housing.

Of course, the situation of new lines is special and there are many difficulties, but with the care of the Party and the government, the difficulties can certainly be overcome. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his political report at the Eighth National Congress of the Party, some problems have not been resolved in a timely manner due to the "bureaucratic attitude of not caring about the sufferings of the masses" in our leadership. It was not until June of this year, after the Ministry of Railways issued instructions on the issues of workers' lives and housing, that our engineering bureau began to pay attention and importance to this aspect, organized a housing committee, formulated a comprehensive plan based on the characteristics of the new railways in the Northwest, developed a plan to build long-term bases and temporary bases for workers' families in suitable areas, and made some movable houses that are easy to move in order to take care of the few workers who have special difficulties in life and are currently separated from their families. Now, we have built 2,000 long-term bases near Agan Town, and have made more than 800 movable houses on the construction site. We know that our construction area will become more and more difficult in the future, and the families of workers must be settled in the family base. If the families are still moved with the workers, it will not only affect the work, but also be inconvenient for the health of the workers' families and the schooling of their children due to the difficulty of life supply.

To better solve the difficulties in the lives, supply and housing of workers that occur in the construction of railways in the Northwest region, a more effective way is to gradually strengthen mechanized construction. Mechanized construction can greatly reduce the number of workers, thus greatly reducing the problems of life, supply, and housing, and at the same time, it can improve the construction level and accelerate the construction speed.

Based on our experience in the Northwest over the past few years, it is necessary to appropriately strengthen the proportion of mechanized construction in areas with many difficulties such as west of Yumen. Of course, in places where the difficulties are not too great, we should still make full use of the important advantage of our country's large labor force. At present, the level of mechanization in our bureau's construction is only 17.6%, which cannot effectively reduce the number of workers in difficult areas and reduce the difficulties in supply. In addition to our efforts to improve the utilization rate of existing machinery, I think we should improve and strengthen this work to accelerate the construction of new railways in the Northwest.

    增加西北新线筑路机械
    铁道部第一工程局局长　陈遗
    西北地区的新建铁路任务，是由铁道部第一工程局担任的。六年来，已在甘肃境内修建了铁路干线、支线一千三百零七公里。在西北地区修建铁路，自然环境和施工条件都是比较困难的，如兰新线要通过海拔三千公尺终年积雪的乌峭岭，在嘉峪关外，又大都是一望无际的戈壁滩，草滩，数百公里地无人烟。铁路要穿过地质情况非常复杂的流沙，碱滩，沼泽，石膏地带。这给施工必然带来许多想不到的困难，尤其是水源缺乏，房屋不易修盖，工程用水，职工生活用水，都要用汽车运输，近者十至二十公里，远的在百公里以外。数万修路职工战斗在这样的地区上，其工作生活条件的困难和艰苦情况，的确不是一般地区所能比较的。加之新线工程流动分散，它和厂矿企业固定在一个点上显然是不同的，职工长年流动在几百公里长的线路上，不论是段队或现场工人，都要经常搬动，工程进展愈快，流动性就愈大，这一特点造成职工生活上的很大困难。因为我们的家属基地，还没有完全建成，职工家属还有随职工去现场生活的，这就更加重了生活供应和住宅方面的困难。但是，这些困难并没有吓倒具有“让高山低头，叫河水让路”英雄气魄的工人阶级。没有房子住，他们就自动的依山傍崖，挖窑掘洞，用芨芨草编席搭棚；没有水用，他们就修涝池，挖地窖储水，用骆驼驮水，用汽车、马车从几十里外拉水；没有青菜，曾发生过夜盲症，他们就想办法吃羊肝汤，自己生豆芽，做豆腐。但是，我们不能让职工长时期处在这样艰苦的环境下工作，我们有责任对这方面的情况逐步加以改善。
    在发展生产，提高劳动生产率的基础上，逐步改善职工的物质文化生活是我们党的基本政策之一。几年来，我们对关心职工生活问题，尤其是职工家属住宅方面的问题，虽已进行了不少工作，但总的说来，我们第一工程局对执行党的这项政策是十分不够的。几年来，国家投资和用企业奖金，在基地和现场，共为职工家属修建了三千五百四十七户的住房，占现有家属户数的24％（现场修路职工有临时房屋），显然职工的住房，解决得还是不够的。在这种情况下，子女上学等问题，就很难照顾。因此，有的职工反映说：“扫了老盲，还要扫小盲。”有的家属说：“农村里农业合作化搞得热火朝天，干铁路不如回家种地”。这说明我们工程局领导上还存在着不关心职工群众切身利益的官僚主义作风，今后除我们自己要关心职工群众切身生活外，还希望国家在职工家属住宅投资方面能给予大力支持。
    固然，新线情况特殊，困难很多，但在党和政府的关怀下困难一定是可以克服的。正如刘少奇同志在党的第八次全国代表大会上作的政治报告中所指出的，由于我们领导上还存在着“不关心群众痛痒的官僚主义态度”，有些问题才未及时得到解决。直到今年6月，铁道部关于职工生活及住房问题作了指示后，才引起我们工程局在这方面的注意和重视，组织了住宅委员会，依据西北新建铁路特点，拟定了全面规划，制定了方案，在适中地区建设职工家属长远基地和临时基地，另外制作了一些便于迁移的活动房屋，以照顾生活特殊困难的目前同家属分居的少数职工。现在，我们已在阿干镇附近修建二千户的长远基地，在施工现场已制作了八百余户的活动房屋。我们知道，今后我们施工地区将愈加艰苦，职工家属必须安置在家属基地上，如让家属仍随职工搬动，不仅影响工作，同时由于生活供应困难，对职工家属的身体健康和子女求学都是不便的。
    要比较好地解决西北地区修建铁路所发生的职工生活、供应和住房困难问题，比较有效的办法还是逐步加强机械化施工。机械化施工可以大量减少职工人数，因而生活、供应以及住房等等都可大大减少，同时也可以提高施工水平，加速建设速度。
    根据我们在西北几年工作的体会，像在玉门以西这样困难很多的地区修筑铁路，适当地加强机械化施工比重是必要的，当然在困难不是太大的地方，仍然应充分利用我国劳动力众多的这一重要的有利条件。目前我局施工中的机械化水平只达17.6％，还不能有效地减少困难地区的职工人数，减少供应上的困难。除我们努力提高现有机械使用率外，我认为应提高加强这方面的工作，以加速西北新线铁路的建设。
