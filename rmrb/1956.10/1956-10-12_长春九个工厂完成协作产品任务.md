Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Nine factories in Changchun that supply collaborative automotive products had already completed their task of supplying 1,000 sets of automotive collaborative products for the First Automobile Works for the entire year by October 6th, ahead of schedule. This has provided favorable conditions for the full-scale production of the First Automobile Works.

This year, the collaborative factories in Changchun have trial-produced and manufactured over 130 collaborative products. More than 80 collaborative products successfully trial-produced by the Changchun Automotive Parts Factory have maintained relatively stable quality after being put into batch production. The air filter for automotive engines, which was successfully trial-produced by this factory, has received favorable reviews after testing. The quality of vehicle tools manufactured by the Automotive Vehicle Tool Factory has improved significantly, and the defect rate has been declining daily. Currently, the collaborative factories are signing product supply contracts for next year with the First Automobile Works.

The various automotive collaborative product factories in Changchun were gradually rebuilt from small local industrial enterprises along with the construction of the First Automobile Works.

    长春九个工厂完成协作产品任务
    据新华社讯　长春市有九个供应汽车协作产品的工厂，在10月6日已经提前完成了全年供应第一汽车制造厂一千辆份汽车协作产品的任务。为第一汽车厂全面开工生产提供了有利条件。
    长春市各协作厂今年试制和生产了一百三十多项协作产品。长春汽车配件厂试制成功的八十多项协作产品，在投入成批生产后，质量都比较稳定。这个工厂试制成功的汽车发动机上的空气滤清器，经过试验得到好评。汽车随车工具厂制造的随车工具，质量有了显著进步，废品率逐日下降。目前，各协作厂正和第一汽车厂签订明年的产品供应合同。
    长春市各个汽车协作产品工厂，是随着第一汽车厂的建设，由小型地方工业企业逐步改建起来的。
