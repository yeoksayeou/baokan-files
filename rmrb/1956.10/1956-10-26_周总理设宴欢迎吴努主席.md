Premier of the State Council and Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhou Enlai, held a banquet at the Beijing Hotel tonight to welcome the Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, U Nu, and his wife, on their visit to China.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice-Premier Chen Yi, and Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu greeted the guests at the entrance. At the reception, the distinguished guests reunited with Vice-Chairman Zhu De and other old friends, and the hosts and guests engaged in cordial conversations.

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the banquet. He expressed his great pleasure in warmly welcoming the old friend of the Chinese people, Chairman U Nu, his wife, and other Burmese friends to visit China. Premier Zhou Enlai said: We are happy, first of all, because Chairman U Nu is from Burma, a neighbor like a relative, and the friendship between our two peoples not only has a long tradition of many centuries but is also built on the foundation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; also because the close friendly cooperation between our two countries is inseparable from the efforts of Chairman U Nu.

Premier Zhou Enlai said: Now we are pleased to see that the Burmese government, under the leadership of Prime Minister U Ba Swe, is continuing along the road of Sino-Burmese friendship, which Chairman U Nu has put great effort into paving, together with the Chinese government. He said: This flower of friendship, growing in the soil of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, should be cherished and cultivated by the politicians of both countries, so that it can withstand all kinds of hardships and bloom for a long time. He believes that Chairman U Nu's visit to China will give us the opportunity to exchange views sincerely and unreservedly, which will always be beneficial to further strengthening the understanding and friendship between our two countries.

Chairman U Nu spoke at the meeting, expressing his gratitude to the hosts. He said: We are not only friends, but also like relatives. He also said: This is my third visit to China, and soon Premier Zhou Enlai will also visit Burma for the third time. He believes that these mutual visits will help the development of friendship between the two countries.

Referring to peaceful coexistence, Chairman U Nu said that we have never been hypocritical, and the people of both countries, as well as the leaders of both countries, are very friendly. He said that when I contacted the Chinese leaders, I felt that they were sincere to us.

Chairman U Nu said: When we build the Sino-Burmese friendship mansion, we may encounter some difficulties, but this is not surprising, because we will encounter difficulties even when we build houses. As long as we can be patient and persistent in our efforts, we will surely build a very high, very beautiful, and very good friendship mansion. He also said: Whenever I encounter difficulties, I naturally think of my old friend Premier Zhou Enlai, because he is the most capable of enduring difficulties.

    周恩来总理在宴会上讲话。他表示以十分高兴的心情，热烈欢迎中国人民的老朋友吴努主席和他的夫人以及其他缅甸朋友们来中国访问。周恩来总理说：我们感到高兴，首先因为吴努主席是来自亲戚般的邻邦缅甸，我们两国人民之间的友情不仅具有多少世纪的悠久传统，而且是建筑在和平共处的五项原则的基础上的；还因为我们两国能有现在这样密切的友好合作关系是同吴努主席的努力分不开的。

    吴努主席在会上讲话，对主人表示感谢。他说：我们之间不仅是朋友，而且像亲戚一样。他又说：我这次来中国已是第三次了，不久周恩来总理到缅甸访问也将是三次了。他相信，这些相互访问，将有助于两国友谊的发展。

    吴努主席说：当我们建筑中缅友谊大厦时，很可能遇到一些困难，但是这不必奇怪，因为我们就是建筑房屋时也会遇到困难的。这只要我们能忍耐，能坚持努力，就一定会建成很高、很美丽、很好的友谊大厦。他又说：每当遇到困难时，我就很自然地想起老朋友周恩来总理，因为他是最能忍耐困难的。
