    Nearly 50,000 Immigrants Moved to Qinghai
    Achieve Good Production Results and Improved Living Standards
    (Our report) Qinghai Province received nearly 50,000 immigrants from provinces and cities such as Henan, Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai in the first half of this year, of which 48,000 were distributed and settled in local agricultural cooperatives. After the immigrants arrived in the settlement areas, under the unified organization of the agricultural cooperatives, they reclaimed wasteland together with the local cooperative members, increasing the cultivated area in these areas by more than 323,000 mu. These farmlands can produce more than 64.4 million jin of grain. Therefore, in the first year of participating in local production, not only was there enough grain to eat, but many households had surplus grain. For example, according to the pre-distribution plan of the agricultural cooperative, 71% of the 59 immigrant households in Dayuan Township, Huangzhong County, will have surplus grain after deducting the next year's rations. A survey of five townships in Datong County showed that more than 50% of households may have surplus grain.
    Many immigrants have been loved and trusted by local cooperative members because of their hard work, fairness, and love for the cooperative. In Jiahe'er District of Hualong Hui Autonomous County, 21 immigrants were selected as models, and 41 activists were selected as directors and deputy directors of cooperatives, production team leaders, etc. Among the immigrants in Dayuan Township, Huangzhong County, 26 people were selected as various work models and township and cooperative cadres. The relationship between immigrants and local cooperative members is very harmonious. They teach and learn from each other in production and help each other in life; some have even become relatives. Through half a year of production, the immigrants have patiently taught the local cooperative members the advanced production experience and technology from their hometowns. The immigrants in Qiaoyu Township, Datong County, in addition to promoting the use of seed drills locally, also helped nearby townships with sowing, playing a certain role in promoting the technology of broadcasting to strip planting. Due to the adoption of seed drill sowing in Dayuan Township, Huangzhong County, strip planting was expanded by more than 500 mu.
    Currently, immigrants who have brought their families have raised livestock and poultry, and are seizing the time before the autumn harvest to dry vegetables, accumulate fertilizer, and gather firewood to prepare for winter and next year's production. Immigrants who have not brought their families are also actively creating conditions to prepare for bringing their families after the autumn harvest. (Jiao Huide)

    移往青海的近五万移民
    生产成绩良好，生活得到改善
    本报讯　青海省今年上半年接收了来自河南、河北、北京、天津、上海等省、市的近五万移民，其中有四万八千人分散安置在当地农业合作社里。移民到达安置地区以后，在农业社统一组织下，与当地社员共同开荒，使这些地区共增加了种植面积三十二万三千余亩，这些农田可打粮食六千四百余万斤。因此在参加当地生产的第一年，不仅粮食够吃，而且不少户有余粮。如湟中县大源乡的五十九户移民，依据农业社的预分方案计算，将有71％的户，除去明年的口粮外还有余粮。大通县五个乡的调查，有余粮的户可能占50％以上。
    不少移民因劳动好、办事公道、爱社如家，受到了当地社员的爱戴和信任。化隆回族自治县加河尔区，有二十一名移民被选为模范，四十一名积极分子被选为合作社的正副主任、生产队长等。湟中县大源乡的移民中被选为各种工作模范和乡、社干部的有二十六人。移民和当地社员关系，都很融洽，他们在生产上互教互学，生活上相互帮助；有些人已经结成了亲戚。通过半年来的生产，移民们已把原籍的先进生产经验和技术，耐心地教给当地社员。大通县樵渔乡的移民，除在本地推广耧摆技术外，还帮助附近各乡播种，对于推广撒播改条播的技术，起了一定的作用。湟中县大源乡由于采取了耧摆播种，扩大了条播五百余亩。
    目前，已带家属的移民，都喂上了家畜、家禽，并在抓紧秋收前的空隙时间晒干菜、积肥料、打柴草，准备过冬和明年的生产。没有带家属的移民，也都在积极地创造条件，准备秋后接家属。　（矫惠德）
