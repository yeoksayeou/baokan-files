Excellent Japanese Industrial Products
—An Interview with the Head and Deputy Head of the Japanese Merchandise Exhibition Delegation
　　Lin Xi, Zheng Yingda

During the two weeks that Japanese merchandise has been exhibited in Beijing, the number of visitors has exceeded 800,000, some of whom came from Tianjin, Shenyang, and even more distant cities and villages. However, many more people are eager to visit but cannot find the time to come to Beijing. Entrusted by readers from other places, we visited Mr. Suketani Eiichi, head of the Japanese Merchandise Exhibition Delegation, and Mr. Kataoka Takashi, the deputy head, one evening recently, hoping that they would introduce the most excellent items in this exhibition to the broad masses of the Chinese people through the newspaper.

Mr. Suketani and Mr. Kataoka received us at their residence. In order to introduce the exhibits in more detail, they also invited Mr. Oshikawa, the head of the exhibits department. Mr. Suketani said that a considerable portion of the exhibits this time are agricultural machinery. He emphasized that he himself has some research in the field of agricultural machinery, so he believes that the small and medium-sized agricultural machines in the exhibits are suitable for use in Chinese rural areas; among them, cultivators can be widely promoted in China, especially in the rice paddies and hilly areas of the south, because the farming conditions and the physical strength of farmers in China and Japan are basically the same. The cultivators in this exhibition include many varieties, and their general power is four to six horsepower, with a daily cultivation capacity of seventeen to twenty-five mu; plowing and soil breaking can be carried out simultaneously. Its prime mover can also be used for transportation, spraying powder, rice milling, and other work.

Mr. Kataoka introduced Japan's chemical fiber industry to us. This industry has a history of more than twenty years in Japan. After World War II, especially in recent years, Japan's chemical fiber industry has developed to a great extent. This is a chemical product using carbolic acid extracted from coal, gas from calcium carbide, and wood pulp as raw materials. Its application range is very wide. For example, it can be used as insulation material in telecommunications equipment, insulation equipment in agriculture, especially the application of rayon and artificial cotton, which has begun to exceed natural fibers such as cotton, silk, wool, and hemp. In the past, a considerable part of the raw materials for Japan's cotton textile industry depended on imports, but due to the development of the chemical fiber industry, this situation has changed. The raw materials for chemical fibers can be completely solved domestically in Japan, and a large number of chemical fiber products are exported.

High-strength rayon is also very developed in Japan. This product is of great benefit to the rubber industry. For example, when used as tire cords in automobile tires, the life of the tires is several times longer than when using ordinary cotton threads, and its cost is not much different from the price of cotton threads. Vinylon, one of the nylon products, is used in horticulture in Japan alone for about 15 to 20 million yards per year. This is a translucent cloth-like material, which is used to build greenhouses instead of glass. Because it can transmit ultraviolet rays, it is very beneficial to the growth of crops.

The automatic typesetting machine using radio waves in the exhibits is a new type of printing machine independently created by the Japanese people in recent years. It can use radio waves for remote transmission. While typing on a keyboard similar to a typewriter (with 4,200 characters on the type disc), the typesetting machine on the other side can automatically cast the characters and arrange them. The speed of this is simply incomparable to the current manual typesetting and arrangement.

The precision of small machine tools manufactured in Japan can compete with Swiss products. Therefore, Japanese-made watches have reached a fairly high level.

The application of semiconductors in Japan is also very wide. Some of the exhibits this time are radios manufactured using semiconductors. They are small and exquisite, easy to carry, and have clear tones.

Synthetic resin products can replace steel and be made into various types of pipes, gears, and saw teeth. They are not only resistant to high temperatures, but also have strong acid resistance.

Mr. Suketani and Mr. Kataoka expressed their gratitude for the support of the Chinese government and people for this merchandise exhibition. They were particularly excited that Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Zhu, Premier Zhou, and Chairman Liu Shaoqi and other leaders visited the Japanese merchandise exhibition one after another.

Mr. Kataoka said that in the past, the trade volume between China and Japan accounted for 30% to 40% of Japan's total trade volume, while now it only accounts for 1% to 2% of Japan's total trade volume. The Japanese people and the vast number of people in the economic circles have realized this abnormal phenomenon, and will make various efforts to expand Sino-Japanese trade in the future.

    优良的日本工业产品
    ——访日本商品展览团团长和副团长
  　林晰　郑颖达
    日本商品在北京展出的半个月里，参观群众已超过八十万人，他们之中有的来自天津、沈阳以及更远的城市和乡村。但是更多的人们渴望参观而不能抽身来到北京。我们受外地读者之托，在最近的一天晚间访问了日本商品展览团团长宿谷荣一先生、副团长片冈峻先生，希望他们把这次展品中最优秀的部分通过报纸介绍给广大的中国人民。
    宿谷团长和片冈副团长在他们的住所接见了我们，为了比较详细地介绍展品，还请来了展品部部长押川先生。宿谷团长说，这次展品中有相当多一部分是农业机械。他强调地说，他本人在农业机械方面还有些研究，所以认为展品中的那些中小型农业机械是适合中国农村使用的；其中，耕耘机在中国可以大量推广，特别是南方的水稻和山坡地区，这是因为中国同日本的耕作情况和农民的体力基本上相同。这次展品中的耕耘机包括很多品种，它们一般的动力是四到六匹马力，每天耕作能力为十七亩至二十五亩；翻地、碎土的工作可以同时进行。它的原动力还可以应用在搬运、撒药粉、碾米等工作上。
    片冈先生向我们介绍了日本的化学纤维工业。这种工业在日本已经有了二十多年的历史。第二次世界大战以后，特别是最近几年来，日本的化学纤维有了很大程度的发展。这是一种利用煤中提炼出来的石炭酸、电石中的瓦斯气体以及木浆等原料的化学制品，它的应用范围很广，例如可以作电讯器材中的绝缘材料，农业上的保温设备，特别是人造丝、人造棉的应用，已经开始超过棉、丝、毛和麻等天然纤维。过去，日本的棉纺工业原料，相当大一部分依赖于进口，但由于化学纤维工业的发展，这种情况已经改变了，化学纤维的原料在日本国内完全可以自己解决，而且有大批化学纤维产品出口。
    强力人造丝在日本也很发达，这种制品对橡胶工业有绝大的好处，例如用在汽车轮胎内作为胎线，轮胎的寿命较用一般棉线要延长几倍的时间，而它的成本与棉线的价格不相上下。尼龙制品之一——文尼珞，仅在日本园艺栽培上的应用，每年约有一千五百万至二千万码。这是一种半透明的类似胶布，用它代替玻璃搭成暖室，由于它可以透过紫外线，所以对农作物的生长十分有利。
    展品中的电波自动铸字机，这是日本人民在近年来独自创造出来的新型印刷机器。它可以利用电波进行远程传送，一边从类似打字机的键盘上打字（铸盘上有四千二百字），在另一边的铸字机上，就可以自动地把字铸出来并排列好，这和目前人工铸字然后再排列的速度简直是难以相比的。
    日本制造的小型工作母机，它的精密程度可以和瑞士的产品相竞争，因此，日本制造的手表已达到相当高的水平。
    日本应用半导体的范围也很广，这次展品中就有一部分利用半导体制造的收音机，它们小巧玲珑，携带方便，而且音调清楚。
    合成树胶制品，可以代替钢铁，制成各型管子、齿轮、锯齿，它不但耐高温，而且耐酸性能也很强。
    宿谷团长和片冈副团长对这次商品展出受到中国政府和人民的支持，表示感谢。对毛主席、朱副主席、周总理和刘少奇委员长等领导人员先后参观日本商品感到特别兴奋。
    片冈副团长说，过去中日贸易额曾达到日本贸易总额的30％至40％，而现在只占日本贸易总额的1％至2％。日本人民和广大的经济界人士已经认识到这种不正常的现象，今后将通过各种努力来展开中日贸易。（附图片）
