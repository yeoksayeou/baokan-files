    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th - According to Soviet newspapers: The land reclamation work started by the Soviet Union in the eastern regions three years ago is still ongoing. To date, the area of newly reclaimed land has increased to 35.5 million hectares (equivalent to 533.25 million *mu*). This greatly exceeds the ambitious plan formulated by the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union in 1954 to reclaim 28 million to 30 million hectares of wasteland by 1956.
    This year, a large part of the Soviet Union's land reclamation work was carried out in the Kazakh Republic. Since the beginning of this year, more than 2 million hectares of wasteland have been reclaimed here. Coupled with the new land reclaimed in the past two years, the newly reclaimed land in Kazakhstan has increased to 20 million hectares.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th - The Kazakh Republic overfulfilled its grain delivery plan to the state ahead of schedule on October 10th. This year, the republic handed over 1.034 billion *pud* (each *pud* equals 32.76 *jin*) of grain to the state. So far, this is the republic with the largest grain delivery in the entire Soviet Union, exceeding the state's planned grain purchase by 402 million *pud*. The total amount of grain handed over to the state by the Kazakh Republic this year is equivalent to the total amount of grain delivered in the past eleven years. The total grain output of the Kazakh Republic this year has reached the planned output target at the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan.
    The victory of the Kazakh Republic's bumper grain harvest is also a victory for the Soviet government's policy of massively reclaiming wasteland and increasing grain production throughout the Soviet Union.
    Most of this year's bumper grain harvest came from newly reclaimed land. In the past two and a half years, the republic has reclaimed a total of 19.8 million hectares of wasteland, so that the spring sowing area this year reached 23 million hectares, more than doubling the sowing area of 7 million hectares in 1953. The cost of grain handed over to the state by the Kazakh Republic this year is also the cheapest. The grain production cost of many state farms in the republic is only 12 to 18 rubles per quintal.
    Today, all major central newspapers in Moscow published a telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, congratulating the Kazakh Republic on its bumper grain harvest.

    苏联超额完成开垦荒地的计划
    三年内共开垦新地三千五百五十万公顷
    大丰收的哈萨克共和国上交粮食最多
    新华社莫斯科12日电　据苏联报纸消息：苏联三年前在东部地区开始的开垦荒地的工作现在仍在继续进行。到目前为止，新开垦的土地的面积已经增加到三千五百五十万公顷（合五亿三千三百二十五万市亩）。这大大超过了苏联共产党和政府在1954年制定的要在1956年开垦二千八百万到三千万公顷荒地的庞大计划。
    今年，苏联的开垦工作很大一部分是在哈萨克共和国进行的。今年以来，这里已经开垦了二百多万公顷荒地。加上过去两年开垦的新土地，哈萨克新开垦的土地已经增加到两千万公顷。
    本报莫斯科12日电　哈萨克共和国于10月10日提前超额完成了向国家交粮计划。今年共和国上交给国家的粮食为十亿三十四万普特（每一普特合三十二点七六市斤）。到目前为止，这是全苏交粮最多的共和国，超过国家预定收购粮食计划四亿二百万普特。共和国今年上交给国家粮食的总数，相等于以往十一年间所交粮食的总数。哈萨克共和国今年的粮食总产量已达到了第六个五年计划结束时指标的计划产量。
    哈萨克共和国粮食丰收的胜利也是苏联政府大量开垦荒地、提高全苏粮食产量政策的胜利。
    今年丰收粮食大半产于新垦荒地。二年半来，共和国一共开垦了一千九百八十万公顷荒地，以致今年春播面积达到了二千三百万公顷。比1953年播种面积七百万公顷增加了二倍多。哈萨克共和国今年上交给国家的粮食成本也最便宜。共和国很多国营农场粮食生产成本每公担只有十二卢布到十八卢布。
    今天莫斯科中央各报都登载了苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议的电报，庆贺哈萨克共和国粮食大丰收。
