    Examining Our Subjectivist Work Style
    Baoding Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    The *People's Daily* published on August 28th, third page, a letter from Comrades Cui Xuming, Shi Xiaoyan, and Liu Yubo criticizing our subjectivist errors in leading corn planting. We agree with the criticism of us made by Comrades Cui Xuming and others, and the situation they revealed is true.
    This year, our subjectivism and bureaucratism in leading agricultural production were serious, prominently manifested in the planting of spring corn. Besides excessively expanding the planting area of spring corn, so that some unsuitable land was also planted with spring corn, it was also manifested in the issue of dense planting of corn.
    At the tenth plenary session of the Prefectural Committee from April 2nd to 4th this year, a "Resolution on Vigorously Strengthening the Leadership of Spring Planting and Seedling Management" was made. The resolution stipulated that "spring corn should have 3,000 to 3,500 plants per mu, and intercropped 'er ma ya' [horse tooth] corn in wheat fields should have 3,500 to 4,000 plants (3,000 plants for spring corn refers to single plants in row planting, and 3,500 plants refers to double plants in hole planting)." In guiding planting, we also emphasized the method of using yardsticks to plant and fix seedlings, requiring the commune members who went to the fields to plant and fix seedlings to bring rulers and yardsticks to ensure dense planting was carried out completely according to the prescribed number of plants. At that time, the masses had a resistant attitude towards excessively dense corn planting, but because we were in the high tide of the socialist transformation movement at that time, our minds were not calm enough, and our work was not in-depth enough, so we failed to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses. At the county party secretaries and county magistrates reporting meeting held in early May, many comrades further reflected the opinions of the masses, proposing that: corn should not be planted so densely, and the number of plants should be appropriately reduced when fixing seedlings. We then put forward revised opinions: large corn (white horse tooth, golden queen, etc.) should have about 3,000 plants per mu for hole planting (leaving double plants), and about 2,500 plants for row planting (leaving single plants), a reduction of 500 plants from the original. Although it was also proposed at the same time that it should be adapted to local conditions and not be too mechanical, the principle of adapting to local conditions was not well implemented due to the great enthusiasm for dense planting in the guiding ideology at that time. In early June, the responsible comrades of the Prefectural Committee went to Quyang and Fuping and found that the number of corn plants in many places was still above 3,000 or even 4,000 (at this time, the corn had been fixed and was generally more than two feet tall), which seemed too dense. Therefore, after discussion by the Prefectural Committee, it was considered that the number of plants should be reduced again. All counties organized forces to convey the opinions of the Prefectural Committee. However, due to the large number of production tasks in the countryside at that time, the masses had a mentality of cherishing seedlings, and coupled with the lack of specific organizational work, although some of them were pulled out, some that should have been pulled out were not pulled out, and there were still 3,000 or even 3,500 plants per mu.
    In mid-July, we received a letter of accusation from sixteen cadres in Quyang County against dense planting of corn. The Prefectural Committee immediately discussed it and decided to convene a county magistrate meeting in different areas to specifically study the late-stage management of corn, and sent Comrade Wang Hongru, Deputy Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, to Quyang to review the subjectivism and bureaucratism in the leadership of spring corn dense planting on behalf of the Prefectural Committee. The above is a simple process and situation of our mistakes in leading corn dense planting.
    The main reason for this error is that we have serious subjectivism and bureaucratism in our leadership work. After the entire region achieved advanced agricultural cooperatives last winter, rural productivity was greatly liberated, and the enthusiasm of farmers for production was unprecedentedly high, and the masses were also unprecedentedly smooth in carrying out work tasks and accepting science and technology. In this high tide of socialism, our minds were not clear, and we not only did not pay full attention to the opinions of the masses and the objective laws of work, but one-sidedly believed that: in the high tide of socialism, wherever the leadership can point, the masses can go. We over-believed in our subjective initiative, over-emphasized the aspect of leadership opinions, and ignored the opinions of the masses and opposing opinions. When we started to promote dense planting of corn, some cadres and the masses had some resistant attitudes towards the requirements for excessive density. We did not pay attention to and listen to these opinions, and some opinions were even criticized by us in the name of conservative thinking. When we formulated the spring corn dense planting plan, we mainly based it on the high-yield experience of a few state-owned farms and agricultural cooperatives in certain areas. These experiences did exist, and they did plant so many plants and increased production. However, we ignored that these dense planting and high-yield experiences were obtained under good conditions such as better land and sufficient fertilizer and labor, and strong technical guidance. When promoting these experiences, we failed to adapt to local conditions according to the specific conditions and soil characteristics of our region, but promoted them in a generalized and rigid manner. In addition, after discovering the error, we also lacked strong perseverance and practical and specific organizational work, so that the error was not corrected in a timely and thorough manner. If we had taken some more specific and effective measures and resolutely implemented them when we discovered this problem in early June, the error might have been corrected more timely.
    The above is only a report of some situations and our preliminary examination. After the autumn harvest, we also plan to conduct a comprehensive examination and summary.

### 检查我们的主观主义作风

专栏：对本报批评的反应

    检查我们的主观主义作风
    中共保定地方委员会
    人民日报8月28日第三版发表了崔旭明、石笑岩、刘玉波等同志批评我们领导种植玉米中的主观主义错误的信，我们同意崔旭明等同志对我们的批评，他们所揭发的情况属实。
    今年我们在领导农业生产中的主观主义和官僚主义是严重的，突出地表现在种植春玉米上。除去过分扩大了春玉米的种植面积，使一些不适宜的土地也种上了春玉米外，还表现在玉米的密植问题上。
    今年4月2日到4日地委第十次全会上，作了“关于大力加强春播和幼苗管理工作领导的决议”。在决议中规定了“春玉米每亩三千至三千五百棵，麦田间作的二马牙三千五至四千棵（春玉米三千棵系指条播单株，三千五百棵系指穴播双株留苗）”。在指导播种中并强调了用丈杆尺量的办法来播种定苗，要求下地做播种定苗工作的社员都带尺子带丈杆，以保证完全按规定的棵数进行密植。当时群众对玉米过密是有抵触情绪的，但是由于当时正处在社会主义改造运动高潮中，我们头脑不够冷静，工作不够深入，因而未能虚心倾听群众的意见。在5月初召开的县委书记、县长汇报会议上，不少同志进一步反映了群众意见，提出：玉米播种太密，定苗时应当适当把棵数减少些。我们就提出修改意见：大玉米（白马牙、金皇后等）穴播的（双棵留苗）每亩三千棵左右，条播的（单棵留苗）二千五百棵左右，比原来的减少了五百棵。虽然也同时提出了应因地制宜，不要过于机械，但由于当时指导思想上密植的劲很大，因而因地制宜的原则并未很好贯彻执行。6月初，地委负责同志到曲阳、阜平，发现不少玉米的棵数仍在三千棵以上甚至四千棵（这时玉米已定苗，一般长二尺多高），显得过密。因此，又经地委讨论，认为应再次减少棵数。各县都组织力量，传达了地委意见。但是，由于当时农村生产任务很多，群众有惜苗思想，再加上组织工作不具体，虽然拔掉了一部分，但仍有一部分该拔的没有拔，每亩还在三千棵甚至三千五百棵以上。
    7月中旬，我们接到曲阳县十六名机关干部对玉米密植的控诉信，地委当即进行讨论，决定分片召开县长会议，专门研究玉米后期管理，并派地委副书记王洪儒同志去到曲阳，代表地委检讨领导春玉米密植中的主观主义、官僚主义。以上就是我们在领导玉米密植中所犯错误的简单过程和情况。
    造成这种错误的主要原因，是我们在领导工作中有严重的主观主义和官僚主义作风。去年冬季，全专区实现了农业高级合作化以后，农村生产力大大的解放了，农民生产情绪空前高涨，群众在执行工作任务和接受科学技术上也空前顺利。在这社会主义高潮中，我们的头脑不清醒了，我们不但没有充分地注意群众意见和工作的客观规律，却片面认为：在社会主义高潮中，领导能指到那里，群众就能走到那里。我们过于相信了自己的主观能动性，过于强调了领导意见的一面，忽视了群众的意见和反面的意见。开始推广玉米密植的时候，一些干部和群众对要求过密的规定就有些抵触情绪，我们没有重视和听取这些意见，甚至有的意见还被我们以保守思想为名给批判回去了。我们制定春玉米密植计划的时候，主要是根据某些地区少数国营农场和农业社的丰产经验。这些经验确实是有的，也确实种了这么些棵数，增了产。但是，我们却忽视了，这些密植丰产经验，是在较好的土地和有充足的肥料与劳力，并有坚强的技术指导等良好的条件下获得的。在推广这些经验时，未能因地制宜根据我专区的具体情况和土质特点，而是一般化地硬性推广。另外，我们在发现错误之后，也缺乏坚强的毅力和切实具体的组织工作，以致使错误未得到及时彻底的纠正。如果在6月初发现这个问题时，采取一些更具体有效的措施，坚决地实行，错误纠正也许会及时些。
    以上仅是汇报一些情况和我们的初步检查，秋收后我们还准备作全面的检查总结。
