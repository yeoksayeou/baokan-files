Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 25th. In Fujian Province, which has a large number of relatives of overseas Chinese, fourteen counties and cities have now established notarization agencies. Some overseas Chinese hometowns are also preparing to set up notarization agencies. According to statistics, notarization agencies in fourteen cities (counties), including Fuzhou, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Fuqing and Minhou, notarized 58 legal documents such as powers of attorney, wills, and kinship certificates for overseas Chinese and their relatives in July, August, and September, protecting the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese.

Zhang Tingzhen, a returned overseas Chinese in Xiamen, has a piece of real estate in Malaya that was requisitioned by the local government, and he can obtain a compensation fee. He wrote a power of attorney, which was notarized by the Xiamen Municipal People's Court, authorizing his relative Luo Jinluan in Malaya to collect it on his behalf. After the death of Lin Tianyuan's father, a returned overseas Chinese, in Malaya, he left behind properties such as houses and rubber plantations, which should be inherited by him. He wants to entrust his sister, who lives in Malaya, to manage them on his behalf. This matter was notarized by the Fuzhou Notary Office, so that Lin Tianyuan's inheritance, management and entrustment of the above-mentioned inheritance can take effect abroad.

Lin Xili, an overseas Chinese businessman in Indonesia, also made a special trip to the Fuzhou Notary Office to make a will when he returned to China for sightseeing this summer, stipulating how to handle his future property in China. He said: "I am far away abroad, so I feel more at ease to make a will first, which can also protect the inheritance rights of my wife and children."

Chen Xuemei, a relative of overseas Chinese in Longyan County, has a husband in Malaya and wants to go to live with her husband recently. However, they did not have a marriage certificate when they got married in the past. Therefore, Chen Xuemei was worried that she would not be able to enter Malaya without this certificate when she went to Malaya. Later, the Longyan County People's Court notarized her marriage relationship, and she was relieved to go abroad.

When handling notarization for overseas Chinese and their relatives, notarization agencies in various places try their best to provide applicants with various conveniences. For example, if a power of attorney needs to be notarized and translated into a foreign language according to the legal format of the country of residence, and it needs to be certified by our foreign affairs department and the foreign affairs agency of the country of residence in China, these procedures are also handled by the notarization agency.

    保护华侨的正当权益
    福建许多地区开展公证工作
    新华社福州25日电　在侨眷众多的福建省，目前已有十四个县、市成立了公证机构。还有些侨乡正在筹备设立公证机构。据统计，福州、厦门、漳州、泉州、福清和闽侯等十四个市（县）的公证机构，在七、八、九三个月中，已为华侨和侨眷公证了五十八起委托书、遗嘱以及亲属证明等法律文件，保护了华侨的正当权益。
    厦门市归侨张廷珍在马来亚有一处地产被当地政府征用，可以取得一笔补偿费。他就写了委托书，经厦门市人民法院公证证明，委托他在马来亚的亲戚罗金銮代为领取。归侨林天源的父亲在马来亚逝世后留下了房屋和橡胶园等产业，应归他继承。他要委托他侨居在马来亚的姊姊代为管理。这件事由福州市公证处作了公证证明，使林天源对上述遗产的继承、管理和委托能在国外生效。
    在印度尼西亚经商的华侨林西梨，今年夏天回国观光时，也特地来到福州市公证处立了一个遗嘱，规定了他将来在国内财产的处理办法。他说：“我远在国外，先立一个遗嘱放心些，也能保障妻子儿女的继承权利。”
    龙岩县侨眷陈雪梅的丈夫在马来亚，最近要到她丈夫那里去住。但是他们过去结婚时没有结婚证书，因此陈雪梅担心去马来亚时没有这项证明而不能入境，后来由龙岩县人民法院给她公证证明了婚姻关系，他就放心出国了。
    各地公证机构在为华侨、侨眷办理公证时，都尽量给申请人以各种便利。如办理委托书公证需要按照侨居国法定格式译成外文，并要通过我外事部门和侨居国在华的外事机构认证，这些手续也都由公证机构代为办理。
