    Restore Original Merchants to Serve Production and Sales

    Wuding County, Yunnan Province, is famous for its pork, chicken, and other meat products. In the past, these products were mainly transported and sold to Kunming and nearby towns. However, in the comprehensive realization of socialist transformation, due to the weakening of the old markets and the absence of new commercial networks, a disconnection between production and sales has emerged.
    Before agricultural cooperation, the chicken and pig businesses in Wuding County were handled by small merchants. There were more than 100 specialized small merchants and more than 1,000 part-time merchants. After cooperation, the number of small merchants decreased significantly. By 1955, there were only 22 small merchants and almost no part-time merchants. In January of this year, the task of purchasing chickens and pigs was unified under the management of the Food Company; at the same time, nine chicken dealers and three pig dealers were organized to purchase on behalf of the Food Company. Due to the insufficient number of Food Company purchasers and small merchants, and the fact that farmers were busy with production, a large backlog of pigs and chickens formed in Wuding. For example, in previous years, Fowo Township sold 20,000 to 30,000 jin of chickens, but this year, although production increased, they could not be sold, while the people of Kunming and other cities have not been able to eat pork and chicken for a long time. Therefore, timely resolution of commercial circulation links is an important task for connecting production and distribution.
    Based on our in-depth investigations in the production areas, we believe that it is necessary to actively restore a portion of the original merchants to continue serving the circulation of sideline products such as pigs and chickens. According to a survey of 612 households in Fowo Township, before the land reform, in addition to farmers selling their products in the market themselves, there were about 60 small merchants mainly engaged in agriculture but also in commerce, and now they have all converted to agricultural production. These merchants have a certain degree of spontaneous influence in the free market, but the vast majority of these people come from the working people and have certain business skills and abilities in operating businesses. For example, the Food Company's purchasers can barely manage one pig, while they can drive a group of pigs with one or two people without feeling tired; the mortality rate of chickens managed by the supply and marketing cooperative is relatively high, while they basically have no or very few deaths when they manage them. We believe that those among the original merchants who are more conscious, have stronger labor power, and have certain business skills and abilities should be organized into township purchasing and transportation groups, under the leadership of the Food Company and the township, to be responsible for the purchase, transportation, and sales of pigs and chickens in rural areas. The purchasing and marketing group should operate according to the uniform regional price differences and legal profits stipulated by the Food Company, and be responsible for its own profits and losses. However, the state and agricultural cooperatives must help them solve the problems of food rations and advance funds for purchasing chickens and pigs.
    In addition to restoring some of the original merchants, the Food Company should also earnestly implement contracts and reasonably resolve price issues. The main problem in the implementation of contracts in the past was poor planning. Every time during festivals, the province would temporarily issue allocation tasks. Due to the large quantities and insufficient prior preparation in the county, it was difficult to complete them. When the supply of chickens and pigs in Kunming was sufficient, the county was not promptly notified to stop the purchase, resulting in a large number of deaths and losses of the chickens and pigs purchased by the county. Therefore, specific plans should be made for the county and township (cooperative) to adjust the quantity of sideline products such as chickens and pigs produced throughout the year, when and where, and how much should be adjusted, so that they can be transported to consumption locations in an organized and planned manner. On the issue of prices, the main problem is that the provincial company's expenses are too high and the county-level company's expenses are too low. The price stipulated by the provincial food company is based on a one-stop approach to purchasing to the county. The actual situation is that the county food company cannot take it all, and must purchase through the grassroots organizations of the supply and marketing cooperatives and merchants on their behalf, which requires paying reasonable handling fees. This handling fee for purchasing on behalf of others is currently not in place, which directly affects the completion of the purchasing task. Due to the higher expenses of the provincial food company, coupled with the excessively large wholesale and retail price differences arranged for merchants in Kunming, an excessive purchase and sale price difference has been created. For example, the purchase price of each jin of hen in Wuding Fowo Township is 0.28 yuan, while the retail price in Kunming reaches 0.7 yuan, or even 0.9 yuan per jin. Therefore, the purchase and sale prices of pigs and chickens must be adjusted to strive for reasonableness. Expenses that can be canceled or reduced must be resolutely canceled or reduced. This will not only reduce the burden on consumers, but also be conducive to the development of production.

    恢复原有商贩为产销服务
    中共云南省委农村、财贸工作部
    云南省武定县以产猪、鸡等肉食品闻名。在过去，这些产品主要运销昆明和附近城镇。但是在全面实现社会主义改造中，由于旧有市场的削弱，新的商业网还没有建立，而出现了产销脱节的现象。
    农业合作化以前，武定县的鸡、猪是由小商贩经营的。全县原有专业小贩一百多人，农兼商的一千多人。合作化后，小商贩有很大程度的减少。截至1955年只有小商贩二十二人，农兼商的几乎绝迹。今年一月，收购鸡、猪的工作则统一划为食品公司经营；同时组织了九个鸡贩三个猪贩代食品公司收购。由于食品公司收购人员和小商贩过少，农民又忙于生产，形成了武定的猪、鸡大量积压。如发窝乡往年卖出鸡两至三万斤，今年产量增加了，却卖不出去，而昆明等城市人民却长期吃不到猪肉和鸡。因此，及时地解决商业流通环节，是联系生产与分配的一个重要工作。
    根据我们深入产地调查，认为必须积极地恢复一部分原有的商贩，使他们继续为猪、鸡等副业产品的流通服务。根据对发窝乡六百十二户的调查，土地改革以前，除掉农民自己到市场出售产品以外，约有以农业为主兼营商业的小贩六十多人，而现在全部转为农业生产了。这些商贩在自由市场中，是有一定程度的自发势力，但是这些人绝大多数出身于劳动人民，在经营商业上，有一定的经营技术和能力。例如，食品公司的收购人员赶一头猪还照顾不了，而他们一两个人赶一群猪并不觉吃力；供销社经营鸡的死亡率较大，他们经营时基本上没有死亡或死亡很少。我们认为应该把原有商贩中觉悟较高、劳动力较强、并且有一定经营技术和能力的人，组成乡的收购运输小组，在食品公司和乡的领导下，负责农村猪、鸡的收购运销业务。购销小组要根据食品公司统一规定的地区差价和合法利润经营，并自负盈亏。但是，国家和农业社必须帮助他们解决口粮、收购鸡、猪的垫本问题。
    除恢复部分原有商贩外，食品公司还应该认真地执行合同和合理地解决价格问题。在执行合同上，过去存在的主要问题是计划性太差。每当逢年过节，省里才临时下达调拨任务，由于数量较大，县里事先准备不足，很难完成；当昆明市鸡、猪供应充足，又未能及时通知停止收购以致县里收购的鸡、猪销售不出去，造成了大批死亡和损耗。因此，具体规划县、乡（社）全年生产鸡、猪等副业产品的上调数量、何时何地、上调多少，使之有组织有计划地运到消费地点。在价格问题上，主要是省公司的费用过高，县级公司的费用过少。省食品公司规定价格是按一条鞭的办法收购到县，实际情况是县食品公司不可能包下来，必须通过供销社的基层组织和商贩代购，这就需要付给合理的手续费。这笔代购手续费目前没有着落，直接影响了收购任务的完成。由于省食品公司的费用较高，加上昆明市安排商贩的批零差价偏大，造成了购销差价过大。例如武定发窝乡每市斤母鸡收购价为二角八分，而昆明市零售价达到七角，甚至九角一斤。因此，猪、鸡的购销价格必须加以调整，以力求合理。可以取消或缩减的费用，要坚决取消或缩减。这样，不但能够减轻消费者的负担，而且有利于生产的发展。
