Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan: The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, which had previously been unable to deliver goods according to contract due to poor product quality, overfulfilled its contracted order task in September, with the quality of most products reaching targets that had not been achieved since the beginning of the year. The rate of substandard quality and downgraded of high-quality thin plates was up to 24% of total output in the first half of the year; In September, it was achieved that not a single ton of defective or downgraded products were produced. The Thin Plate Department used to only deliver more than 200 tons of high-quality steel plates per month, but in September, they delivered two and a half times that amount. The steelmaking department and electric furnace steelmaking department, which had failed to meet quality targets for consecutive months from January to August, also exceeded the national standards for product qualification rates in September.

The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Party Committee, at its representative meeting in August, made a resolution on improving product quality, requiring all workshops to make the greatest efforts to improve product quality. After the meeting, the workshops adopted a series of technical and organizational measures. The steelmaking department adopted methods such as hot charging and annealing, and slow cooling to eliminate white spot scrap. The electric furnace steelmaking department extended the boiling time of alloy steel by five minutes, which greatly reduced steel ingot cracks. The rolling mill department revised operating procedures and strengthened preparation work.

The factory also summarized and promoted many advanced experiences created by workers. The electric furnace steelmaking department summarized the experience of the Gao Zhenhai group in refining pure iron, the forging steel department summarized the experience of Li Guoxing and others in improving quality, and the rolling mill department summarized the experience of the Chang Yongye group in comprehensively completing the plan. These experiences have shown good results in production after promotion.

    太原钢铁厂产品质量提高
    据新华社太原讯　曾经因为产品质量不好而不能按合同交货的太原钢铁厂，9月份超额完成了合同订货任务，多数产品质量达到了今年以来没有达到过的指标。优质薄板在今年上半年因为产品不合格，报废和降级曾达总产量24％；9月份已做到不出一吨废品或降级品。薄板部过去每月只能交出二百多吨优质钢板，9月份却交出了相当于过去每月交出数二倍半。1月到8月连续没完成质量指标的炼钢部和电炉炼钢部，9月份的产品合格率也都超过了国家规定的指标。
    中共太原钢铁厂党组织在8月份召开的代表会议上，曾经就提高产品质量问题作出决议，要求各车间以最大的努力改善产品的质量状况。会后，各车间采取了一系列的技术组织措施。炼钢部采取了热装退火、徐冷等办法，消灭了白点报废。电炉炼钢部把合金钢的沸腾时间延长了五分钟，使钢锭裂纹大大减少。轧钢部修改了操作规程，加强了准备工作。
    工厂还把许多工人创造的先进经验总结起来加以推广。电炉炼钢部总结了高振海小组炼纯铁的经验，锻钢部总结了李国兴等提高质量的经验，轧钢部总结了常永业小组全面完成计划的经验。这些经验推广后在生产中显出了良好效果。
