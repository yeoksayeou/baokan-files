Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to information obtained at the ongoing National Forestry Conference, the national afforestation area this year has reached more than 4.69 million hectares (excluding autumn afforestation area), an increase of more than three times compared with the same period last year. This year's national afforestation task has been overfulfilled by 13%.

Guizhou Province has achieved relatively outstanding results in afforestation this year. The province has afforested more than 323,000 hectares to date, exceeding more than twenty times the same period last year. The afforestation area in Guangxi Province this year is also more than twice the afforestation area in the years since liberation.

Since the spring of this year, various regions have collected more than 9 million jin of tree seeds and cultivated seedlings on more than 46,000 hectares, both of which are greater than the achievements of the same period in previous years.

According to statistics from reports from various provinces within the customs (i.e. mainland China), the number of mountain forest fires this year has also decreased by 65% compared with last year, the area of forest destroyed has decreased by 55%, and the loss of forest trees has decreased by 86%.

However, the quality of afforestation in some areas this year is very poor, and the situation of forest fires is still very serious. Provinces and regions have been conducting a general survey of the survival of young trees since July and have formulated replanting plans based on different situations. For key forest areas, work has also begun to strengthen basic construction and promote scientific fire-fighting methods.

    今年全国造林超额完成任务
    据新华社讯　据正在举行的全国林业会议上了解，今年全国造林面积已达四百六十九万多公顷（不包括秋季造林面积），比去年同期增加三倍多。今年全国造林任务已经超额13％完成。
    今年造林成绩比较突出的是贵州省。全省到目前为止已造林三十二万三千多公顷，超过去年同期二十倍以上。广西省今年的造林面积，也相当于解放后几年来造林面积的两倍多。
    各地今年春天以来采集的树种达九百多万斤，育苗四万六千多公顷，都比往年同期的成绩大。
    据关内各省报告的材料统计，今年山林火灾的次数也比去年减少了65％，毁林面积减少了55％，林木损失减少了86％。
    但是今年有些地区的造林质量很不好，森林火灾的情况还很严重。各省、区已经从7月份起普遍调查幼林的成活情况，并且根据不同情况拟订了补植计划。对于重点林区，也开始加强基本建设和推行科学的灭火方法等工作。
