    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 17th: Partial construction has begun on the comprehensive water conservancy project in the Jingbei area of Hubei Province. From this spring to now, over 4.4 million cubic meters of earthwork for the main canal has been completed. To accelerate the progress of the project, the Jingzhou Special District leadership is continuing to mobilize and organize labor to participate in the construction. It is expected that the excavation of the main canal can be basically completed by the end of 1957.

    The Jingbei area is located north of the Yangtze River and south of the Han River and the East Jing River, including the three counties of Jiangling, Jianli, and Honghu, and parts of Jingmen and Qianjiang counties, with a total area of more than 10,000 square kilometers, a cultivated area of more than 7 million mu, and a population of 2.08 million. This area is one of the main grain and cotton producing areas in Hubei Province. However, due to the low-lying terrain and mixed water systems, not only is waterlogging impossible to drain during the rainy season, but the Yangtze River also backflows, often causing serious disasters.

    After liberation, the People's Government began to survey, measure, and plan in the Jingbei area. By 1955, the comprehensive water conservancy plan was completed. This comprehensive water conservancy project mainly combines the Honghu Lake storage and reclamation project to solve local drainage problems and prevent the Yangtze River from backflowing, striving for agricultural bumper harvests and developing shipping and irrigation. The project mainly adopts the method of upstream storage and downstream discharge, using Changhu Lake as a flood detention reservoir upstream, opening three drainage canals in the middle and lower reaches, with a total earthwork of about 70 million cubic meters, and building 32 new-type ship locks, spillway gates, and control gates. After the completion of the entire project, in addition to eliminating waterlogging disasters, it can expand the cultivated area by more than 2 million mu, use the water stored in Changhu Lake to irrigate farmland, and use the newly opened canals to allow 500-ton freighters to travel directly from Hankou to Shashi through the Xintankou ship lock, shortening the journey from Hankou to Shashi by 184 li, and directly connecting the cotton producing areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Han River basin with Shashi by shipping, creating more favorable conditions for the development of the Jing (zhou) Sha (shi) area's textile industry.

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 17th: The planning of the Gui River (Fu River) basin in Hubei Province has been completed. The key reservoir projects in the plan, such as Hei Wu Wan and Huantan, are undergoing preliminary design and technical design, and are expected to begin construction at the end of this year.

    The planning of the Gui River basin began as early as 1952. During this period, a large number of surveying and planning personnel in Hubei Province repeatedly surveyed and studied the soil, geology, soil and water conservation, and socio-economic aspects of the basin, and carefully analyzed the hydrological characteristics of the Gui River and its tributaries. According to the plan, the Gui River will be transformed from a harmful river to a beneficial river, and the Gui River basin will gradually become a beautiful and rich area. At that time, irrigation projects will be all over the entire basin, nourishing the arid land (with a total irrigation area of more than 3.7 million mu); a large number of barren hills and lakes will be used to grow crops; ships with a draft of one meter can travel freely on the Gui River all year round; after hydropower is gradually developed, the power generation capacity can reach more than 12,000 kilowatts.

    The Gui River flows through the northern and central parts of Hubei Province and is a relatively large river in Hubei Province. It originates from the foothills of the Dahong Mountain and flows into the Han River and the Yangtze River through Chenjiaji and Xingou near Wuhan. The land on both banks is fertile, but the terrain in the upper and middle reaches is steep, the source is short and the flow is rapid, often leading to droughts or flash floods; the river channel in the lower reaches is meandering, and the rivers and lakes are intertwined, coupled with the impact of the Yangtze River and Han River floods, it often overflows into disasters. Therefore, for a long time, more than 70% of the land in this basin has been barren hills and lake areas, and cannot be used to grow crops.

    荆北地区水利综合规划工程局部开工
    溳水流域规划已经编制完成
    新华社武汉17日电　湖北省荆北地区水利综合规划工程已经局部开工。从今年春季到现在，总干渠已经完成开河土方四百多万公方。为加速工程进度，荆州专区领导机关正在继续动员和组织劳力参加施工。预计到1957年年底，可以基本上完成总干渠的开挖任务。
    荆北地区在长江以北，汉水、东荆河以南，包括江陵、监利、洪湖三县和荆门、潜江两县的一部分，总面积一万多平方公里，耕地面积七百多万亩，人口二百零八万。这个地区是湖北省主要粮、棉产区之一。但是，由于地势低洼，水系混杂，每到雨季，不仅渍水无法排泄，而且长江水倒灌，往往造成严重灾害。
    解放后，人民政府就着手在荆北地区进行查勘、测量和规划工作。到1955年，完成了水利综合规划。这个水利综合规划工程主要是结合洪湖蓄洪垦殖工程，解决当地的排水问题和防止长江水倒灌，争取农业丰收和发展航运、灌溉事业。工程内容主要是采取上蓄下泄，上游利用长湖作滞洪水库，中下游开通三条排水干渠，全部土方约七千多万公方，并且兴建新型船闸、泄水闸、节制闸等三十二座。这个工程全部完成后，除免除渍水灾害外，可以扩大耕地面积二百多万亩，利用长湖所蓄的水灌溉农田，并且利用新开的渠道，使载重五百吨的轮船从汉口经过新滩口的船闸直达沙市，缩短汉口到沙市的航程一百八十四里，以及把汉水流域中下游产棉区用航运直接和沙市联系起来，为发展荆（州）沙（市）地区棉纺织业创造更优越的条件。
    新华社武汉17日电　湖北省溳水（府河）流域规划已经编制完成。规划中的黑屋湾、环潭等重点水库工程，正在进行初步设计和技术设计，预计在今年年底开始施工。
    溳水流域规划早在1952年就开始了。在这期间，湖北省大批的勘测、规划人员曾对这个流域的土壤、地质、水土保持和社会经济等方面，反复地进行了查勘和研究，仔细地分析了溳水及其支流的水文特性。按照规划，溳水将由害河变成利河，溳水流域将要逐渐成为一块美丽富饶的地区。那时，灌溉工程将布满在整个流域，滋润着干旱的土地（总计灌溉面积达三百七十多万亩）；大量的荒丘湖泊，将被用来种植庄稼；吃水一公尺的轮船可以终年在溳水上自由往来；水力逐步开发后，发电能力可达一万二千多瓩。
    溳水流贯湖北省北部和中部，是湖北省境内较大的一条河流。它发源于大洪山麓，分别经武汉市附近的谌家矶和新沟，流入汉水和长江。两岸土地肥沃，但上游和中游地势陡峻，源短流急，常常导致旱灾或山洪暴发；下游河道纡曲，河湖交错，加上长江、汉水洪水顶托影响，又往往漫溢成灾。因此，许久以来，这个流域70％以上的土地是荒丘湖泊地区，不能种植庄稼。
