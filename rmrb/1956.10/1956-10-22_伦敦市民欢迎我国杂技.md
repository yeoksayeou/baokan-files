Xinhua News Agency, London, October 21st: The Chinese Acrobatic Troupe gave its final performance at the Princess Theatre in London on the evening of October 20th.

Each performance frequently elicited applause and laughter, and after the last performance, a sustained and stormy cheer erupted immediately. As the Chinese artists waved goodbye on stage, the mesmerized audience cheered repeatedly.

During their three-week stay in London, the Chinese artists gave twenty-six performances to thirty thousand spectators, the majority of whom were seeing such a performance for the first time.

Newspapers and magazines throughout Britain have carried news and photographs of the performances, and have published reviews praising the "exquisite" skill of the acrobatic troupe.
