    "Automobile theft increased by 22.3%, pickpocketing increased by 18.5%, manslaughter increased by 10.2%, rape increased by 6.8%, larceny increased by 4.7%... on average, thirty-seven people are murdered every day, fifty-five women are raped, and seven hundred and thirty-eight cars are stolen... on average, there are four thousand three hundred and seventy-seven cases of pickpocketing, one hundred and sixty-four robberies, and one thousand four hundred and sixty-three larcenies every day...". This series of breathtaking figures does not come from an exaggerated journalist's pen, but from the report on American crime cases in the first half of the year made by J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
    This report, in addition to pointing out that this year's American crime cases have broken the record of the past decade, also specifically warns that American crime cases will greatly exceed this year's in the coming years.
    Of course, Hoover would not dare to touch upon the real social roots that caused this situation. Especially when the "American way of life" is still trying its best to promote itself abroad, any discussion of this aspect is "un-American." However, since such a report has to be published (no matter how much the truth is minimized), a set of arguments should be devised. Fortunately, as the head of the police and special agents, Hoover is proficient in "psychological warfare" and is good at a skill that can seize any opportunity to serve his purposes.
      "The increase in crime is due to the failure of American parents to fulfill their responsibility to educate their children," this is the first conclusion Hoover made about the reasons for the increase in crime in the United States.
    Another conclusion is that there are too few police officers, and the reason for the lack of police officers is that the salaries are too low, and few people are willing to be police officers.
    Hoover does not necessarily deliberately want to wrong many parents in the United States. According to his unique nature, he is single-mindedly trying to draw the second conclusion. He believes that police special agents are omnipotent, and strengthening the police force can eliminate crime. Of course, the police special forces that Hoover wants to strengthen are by no means only to deal with social crimes, but mainly to suppress the struggle for democratic freedom. However, the "clever" Hoover is using the alarming fact that crime cases have greatly increased to promote their plan to establish a police state in the United States.
    The decadent American way of life plus a police state is the goal pursued by the likes of Hoover. (Ya)

### “聪明”的胡佛

    “聪明”的胡佛
    “汽车盗窃案增加了22.3％，扒窃案增加了18.5％，过失杀人罪增加了10.2％，强奸罪增加了6.8％，盗窃罪增加了4.7％……平均每天有三十七人遭凶杀，五十五个女人被强奸，七百三十八辆汽车被盗窃……平均每天发生四千三百七十七件扒窃案，一百六十四件抢劫案，一千四百六十三件盗窃案……”。这一连串让人喘不过气来的数字，并非出自记者的夸张手笔，而是美国联邦调查局局长胡佛所作的上半年美国犯罪案件的报告。
    这个报告除指出今年美国犯罪案件打破十年来的纪录以外，还特别警告说，今后数年内美国的犯罪案件，还要大大超过今年。
    胡佛当然不敢碰一下造成这种局面的真正社会根源。尤其是当“美国生活方式”还正要竭力向国外推销的时候，任何有关这方面的谈论都是“非美”的。但是，既然不能不发表这样的报告（尽管怎样缩小了事实真相），就应该想出一套来辩解一番。好在胡佛作为警察特务头子，他精通“心理战”，并且擅长一种本领，能够抓住任何机会为他的目的服务。
      “犯罪的增加，是由于美国做父母亲的人没有尽好教育子女的责任”，这是胡佛对美国犯罪增加的原因所下的第一个结论。
    另一个结论是：由于警察太少，而警察少是因为薪水低，很少人愿意做警察。
    胡佛倒不一定故意要使美国的许多父母亲含不白之冤，按照他特有的本性，他一心要得出的是第二个结论。他相信警察特务万能，加强警察力量就可以使犯罪绝迹。当然，胡佛所要加强的警察特务力量，决不是仅仅为了对付社会犯罪行为，而主要是用来镇压争取民主自由的斗争。但是，“聪明”的胡佛正在利用犯罪案件大大增加的惊人事实来替他们在美国建立警察国家的计划作宣传呢。
    美国腐朽的生活方式加上警察国家，这就是胡佛之流所追求的目标。　（亚）
