    Hunan Discovers Over Forty Kinds of Minerals
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) Hunan Province's geological exploration and surveying personnel have discovered over forty kinds of minerals in more than nine hundred locations throughout the province. In the Zixing area, spanning five counties including Lian Guan, Chen County, and Yizhang, a remarkably rich deposit of coking coal has been found, covering hundreds of miles; in the Shaoyang and Lianyuan areas, near the soon-to-be-constructed Xiangqian Railway, coal seams several meters thick, with reserves of hundreds of millions of tons, have been discovered, along with numerous iron ore deposits; in Huang County and Shimen, two large phosphate mines have also been found. Furthermore, many non-ferrous metals and non-metallic minerals such as tungsten, tin, lead, zinc, copper, sulfur, arsenic, crystal, and electrode stone have also been successively discovered. In Xiangtan County, geological personnel discovered a manganese mine with excellent development prospects.
    From Yizhang and Zixing in the undulating Five Ridges to Linxiang County, facing the Yangtze River, from the old revolutionary base area of Xianggan to the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, the footprints of exploration and surveying personnel can be found everywhere; the number of exploration and surveying personnel in the province has also increased by 27% compared to the past. Many students who have just graduated from geological professional schools, demobilized construction soldiers, and many rural youths are all traversing the deep mountains in search of jewels, fearlessly seeking treasures. At present, based on accurately surveyed geological data, the state is newly building and expanding coal mines, manganese mines, and other important factories and mines in Zixing, Xiangtan, Zhuzhou City, and other places.

    湖南发现四十多种矿产品
    本报讯　湖南省地质勘探普查人员已经在全省九百多处地方发现了四十多种矿产品。在资兴地区连贯郴县、宜章等五县，方圆数百里的范围内，发现了蕴藏极为丰富的炼焦煤；在靠近即将修建湘黔铁路的邵阳和涟源地区，也发现了厚达几公尺、蕴藏几亿吨的煤和许多铁矿；在晃县、石门还发现了两处较大的磷矿。此外还有许多有色金属和非金属矿如钨、锡、铅、锌、铜、硫、砒、水晶、电极石等也陆续被发现，在湘潭县，地质人员发现一处很有开采前途的锰矿。
    从五岭逶迤的宜章、资兴到面临长江的临湘县，从大革命时代的湘赣根据地到湘西苗族自治州，都有勘探普查人员的足迹；全省勘探普查人员也比过去增加了27％。许多刚从地质专业学校毕业的学生、复员建设军人和许多农村青年，都在踏遍深山寻珠宝，不畏艰险找珍藏。现在国家正根据已经测查确切的地质资料，在资兴、湘潭、株洲市和其他地方，新建和扩建煤矿、锰矿和其他一些重要厂矿。（丘方若）
