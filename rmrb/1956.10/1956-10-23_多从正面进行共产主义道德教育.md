    More Communist Moral Education from a Positive Perspective
    Currently, remnants of the old society in various forms remain in people's minds, such as children abusing their parents, husbands abandoning their wives, and disrespect for the elderly. It is very necessary for newspapers to expose such phenomena from time to time. However, I hope that newspapers will also report more on new people and new deeds with educational significance, and conduct communist moral education for the general public from a positive perspective. Positive examples often give readers greater education and inspiration.

    多从正面进行共产主义道德教育
    目前在人们的思想意识上还保留着形形色色的旧社会的残余，像子女虐待父母、丈夫遗弃妻子、不尊重老人等。报纸上时常揭露这类现象，很有必要。但是我希望报纸同时要更多地报道富有教育意义的新人新事，从正面对广大人民进行共产主义道德的教育。正面的事例往往能给读者更大的教育和启发。
        （中国人民大学　刘泰来）
