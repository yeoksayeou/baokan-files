Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 26th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said at a press conference on October 25th, regarding the Suez Canal issue, that it is now up to the directly concerned countries to deal with each other.

Nehru said that he did not know whether holding negotiations in Geneva had been finally decided. He believed that negotiations might be held there soon.

Nehru explained India's proposal for resolving the Suez Canal issue, which had been published by the Indian government on October 24th. He said, "This is a sincere effort on our part after lengthy negotiations with most of the parties concerned and taking into account the reality of the situation."

A reporter asked if it required the guarantees needed by each country.

Nehru replied that, in the final analysis, of course, there could be no guarantee other than normal international guarantees and agreements reached between the two countries. If the United Nations intervened, there would be a very strong guarantee, but you can see that some disputes are being considered in other ways, and so on. Any further guarantees would actually be a restriction on sovereignty.

The reporter asked him to clarify whether Egypt agreed with the Indian plan. Nehru said, "The impression we get is that they are in favor of the general proposal, but this does not obligate them to any specific part of the plan."

The reporter asked how the United Kingdom, the United States, and France reacted to it. Nehru replied that the reactions of most countries were complex—favoring it but perhaps disliking certain things here and there. At this stage, no country wants to clearly express its attitude.

Someone asked the Prime Minister whether the Government of the United Kingdom had asked India for any clarification on India's plan. He replied, "We have not received any special clarification. And any further clarification is meaningless. We have done our best. It is up to all parties to understand it this way or that way."

Answering a question about the internationalization of the canal after the Security Council discussed the canal issue, Nehru said: It is obvious that the Egyptian government will not agree on this issue. Egypt has made its position very clear to everyone.

Someone asked Nehru to talk about whether there was a greater hope of reaching a solution through negotiation now. He said, "Yes. I think we are definitely at the stage of negotiations now, and it is difficult to turn back."

Regarding the Algerian issue, Nehru said: "I can only say that some of the things that have happened there in the past day or two have made the situation even worse."

He said that our attitude on the Algerian issue has always been: First, Algeria is fully entitled to freedom and independence. Second, this issue, like other issues, should be considered in a friendly manner by all parties, and attention should be paid to all aspects of the issue; for example, in Algeria, there are a large number of French immigrants, who constitute a considerable proportion of the residents. I can only say that the Algerian issue cannot be resolved by force and attempts to suppress the nationalist movement there. Tunisia and Morocco, which have gained independence, have maintained friendly relations with France until recently because of this independence, but now they are very excited about the developments. We Indians, and especially as a government, have consistently tried to pursue some kind of middle ground between our sympathy and our desire not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Third, our hope is to be able to help quietly with a possible solution to the problem.

Regarding his possible trip to the United States, Nehru said: "Although it has not been finalized, the possibility still exists. My difficulty is the lack of time. I hope to go one day. The next few months are very busy. If I manage to go, it inevitably has to be a short period."

Talking about the election issue, the Prime Minister told reporters that the date of the election has not yet been determined, but it will be determined soon. "I estimate it will be around the second half of March and early April."

At this press conference, Prime Minister Nehru also talked about the World Bank President's criticisms of India, the situation in Eastern Europe, and India-Pakistan relations.

    尼赫鲁呼吁苏伊士问题有关国家举行谈判
    并指出用武力解决不了阿尔及利亚问题
    新华社新德里26日电　印度总理尼赫鲁10月25日在记者招待会上谈到苏伊士运河问题的时候说，现在要由直接有关的国家来彼此打交道了。
    尼赫鲁说，他不知道在日内瓦举行谈判这一点是否已经最后决定。他认为，谈判不久可能会在那里举行。
    尼赫鲁解释了印度关于解决苏伊士运河问题的建议，这个建议已经由印度政府在10月24日发表。他说，“这是在同大部分有关人士进行了好久的谈判和考虑到现实局势以后我们这方面所作的真挚的努力”。
    有记者问，它是否需要各国所需的保证。
    尼赫鲁回答说，最后分析起来，当然除了有正常的国际保证以及两国达成协议之外，不可能有别的保证。如果联合国插手的话，那么就有一个非常有力的保证，但是你可以看到，一些争端正在用其他方法等等加以考虑。任何进一步的保证实际上将是对一个主权的限制。
    记者要求他说明埃及是否赞同印度计划。尼赫鲁说：“我们获得的印象是，他们是赞成这个总的建议的，但是这并不使他们对这个计划的任何具体部分负有义务。”
    记者问，英国、美国和法国对它的反应如何。尼赫鲁回答说，大部分国家的反应是复杂的——赞成它，可是也许不欢喜这里和那里的某些东西。在这个阶段，没有一个国家想明确地表示自己的态度。
    有人问总理，联合王国政府是否曾要求印度就印度的计划作任何澄清。他回答说：“从我们得不到特别的澄清。并且任何进一步澄清是没有意义的。我们已经尽我们所能的做了。要由各方面自己去这样理解或那样理解它。”
    尼赫鲁在回答关于在安全理事会讨论了运河问题以后把运河国际化的问题时说：在这个问题上埃及政府不会同意，这一点是明显的。埃及已经非常明确地让大家知道它的立场。
    有人要求尼赫鲁谈谈现在经过谈判取得解决办法的希望是否大一些。他说，“是的。我认为，我们现在肯定地是处在谈判的阶段，并且要回头走是困难的。”
    关于阿尔及利亚问题，尼赫鲁说：“我只能说，在过去一两天内在那里发生的一些事态已经使局势更为恶化。”
    他说，我们在阿尔及利亚问题上的态度一直是这样：第一，阿尔及利亚完全有资格享有自由和独立。第二，这个问题像其他问题一样，应该由各方面以友好的方式加以考虑，并且要注意问题的各方面；例如在阿尔及利亚，有人数很多的法国移民，他们占居民中的相当大部分。我只能说，阿尔及利亚问题是不可能用武力以及试图镇压那里的民族主义运动而得到解决的。已经获得独立的突尼斯和摩洛哥由于获得独立这一点，一直到最近都同法国保持友好的关系，但是现在，它们对于事态发展很激动。我们印度人，而尤其主要是作为一个政府，一贯试图奉行在我们的同情和我们不干涉他国内政的愿望之间的某种中间路线。第三，我们的希望是能够对问题的可能解决不声不响地进行帮助。
    关于他去美国的可能性，尼赫鲁说：“虽然还没有最后决定，但是可能性仍然存在。我的困难就是缺乏时间。我希望有一天可以去。今后的几个月都非常忙。如果我设法去的话，不可避免地不得不是短时期的。”
    谈到选举问题时，总理告诉记者们说，举行选举的日期还没有确定，但很快就会确定的。“我估计大约是在3月下半月和4月初。”
    尼赫鲁总理在这次记者招待会上还谈到世界银行行长对印度的批评意见、东欧局势、印度—巴基斯坦关系等问题。
