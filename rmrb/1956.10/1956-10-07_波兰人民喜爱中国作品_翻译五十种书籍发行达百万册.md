Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 6th: Since the establishment of the People's government twelve years ago, Poland has published fifty kinds of Chinese books, with a total circulation of about one million copies. Before liberation, it was rare to see Chinese books in Poland.
    In People's Poland, thirteen kinds of Mao Zedong's theoretical works have been published. "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" has been published in five volumes (equivalent to the four volumes of the Chinese version). Mao Zedong's "On Practice" and "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War" have been published in two editions.
    Poland has also published Soong Ching Ling's "New China Marches Forward," Zhu De's "How the Chinese People Defeated the Armed Chiang Kai-shek Reactionaries of U.S. Imperialism," Deng Zhongxia's "A Brief History of the Chinese Workers' Movement," and other Chinese theoretical works. "Zhuangzi" (also known as "Nanhua Zhenjing"), by the ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuang Zhou, has also been translated into Polish and published.
    Chinese ancient and modern novels, short stories, and other literary works published in Poland are very popular among readers. These works include: Zhou Libo's "The Hurricane," Liu Baiyu's "Lights Ahead," "Three Warriors," Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River," Zhao Shuli's "The Rhymes of Li Youcai," Guo Moruo's play "Qu Yuan," and the recently published "Selected Chinese Short Stories and Novels," "Selected Chinese Poems," etc.
    Polish publishing houses have also translated and published children's literature written by Chinese writers such as Hua Shan.
