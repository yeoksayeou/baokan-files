    Impressions of Rio de Janeiro
    Xiao Guang

    We took off from Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, at 8:30 in the morning, and in less than an hour, we entered Brazilian airspace. The plane flew almost along the long Brazilian coastline. The reddish-brown Serra do Mar mountains were not far from the coast, and mountain range connected to mountain range. We occasionally flew over coastal cities one after another, the white-walled, red-roofed houses deeply buried in the lush tropical vegetation. The coast was dotted with islands of all sizes. The Atlantic Ocean was to the right, and from above, it was calm and looked like an endless piece of green frosted glass.

    We rested briefly at Alegre, an important port in southern Brazil, and then took a four-engine plane directly to Rio de Janeiro, arriving at our destination at a little after 3:00 PM.

    Although we had flown along the Brazilian coast for a full four hours, we had not even reached a quarter of its total length. Brazil truly deserves to be the largest country in Latin America. Its territory is more than 3.28 million square miles, almost half the area of South America, and larger than the entire European continent. Of the ten countries in South America, all except Chile and Ecuador border Brazil: Venezuela, Colombia, and Guyana to its north; Peru and Bolivia to its west; Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay to the south and southwest. To the east and northeast is the Atlantic Ocean, its coastline of more than four thousand miles continuously washed by the emerald green sea. On this vast land, 63% is dense forest; the Amazon River, the second longest river in the world, crosses the continent from east to west, flowing into the Atlantic Ocean, with a length of over four thousand miles.

    Due to the diverse terrain and the bewildering changes in climate, Brazil's products are abundant and complete: coffee, cotton, cocoa, corn, rice, sugar, fruit, timber (especially hardwood), rubber, and minerals such as iron, coal, oil, nickel, tungsten, manganese, zinc, and soda, it has practically everything. Coffee accounts for half of Brazil's annual exports, and Brazil supplies about three-fifths of the coffee consumed worldwide.

    Brazil has a population of more than 59 million, equivalent to the total population of all other countries in South America; the difference is that Brazil has a large number of black people, and blacks and people of mixed black and white descent account for about 40% of the total population, and they speak a unified Portuguese language.

    Rio de Janeiro is located in the southeast of Brazil, a concave harbor facing the sea and backed by mountains, and is also the largest ship docking center in South America. The bay deeply wedges into the large harbor, and the city stretches tortuously for six or seven miles along the treacherous coastline between the high mountains and the sea. The two peaks of Sugarloaf Mountain, more than a thousand feet high, stand in the sea, surrounded by many rocky islets, forming a natural and strategic gateway. On January 1, 1502, a Portuguese expedition first arrived here and mistook it for the mouth of a large river, so they named it "Rio de Janeiro," meaning "January River."

    The seaside avenue, like a necklace, meanders along the harbor, lined with countless palm trees five or six zhang high. The hotel where we stayed was on this street, and we could enjoy the scenery of distant mountains and nearby waters whenever we opened the window. The fog here is very heavy, and whether it is sunny or rainy, the view is often a hazy gray. We stayed here for more than ten days and never saw the clear outline of Sugarloaf Mountain once. Only the cable car hanging over the sea, because it was sparkling, was still faintly visible. The Corcovado behind the hotel is also a major attraction in Rio de Janeiro, with a huge statue of Jesus with outstretched arms erected on the top, which is two thousand three hundred and seventy-two feet high. At night, when the searchlights are turned on, it can be seen from a great distance.

    Spring does not begin here until September 21st. Although it is still the end of winter, it has the feeling of early summer in Beijing. The temperature is generally between 25° and 30° Celsius. On sunny days, you still sweat in a single layer of clothing, and it is even hotter in the sun.

    Perhaps because they are afraid of the heat, Brazilians particularly like swimming and taking seawater baths. We often saw men and women who had changed into their swimsuits, walking barefoot across the road to the beach. There, colorful parasols and rows of small wooden houses adorned the beach beautifully. People played ball, sunbathed, and chased each other in the water. This scene really made it difficult to associate it with the concept of winter.

    Brazilian friends accompanied us on a car tour of the city.

    Rio de Janeiro can be roughly divided into three parts: the central area, which is the commercial and administrative heart of the city; and the residential areas and suburbs that have developed around it.

    The mile-long Avenida Rio Branco is the city's main street, diagonally running through the city center from northwest to south. Tall Brazilwood trees are arranged in rows, and the sidewalks are paved with stones of various colors in various patterns. Because of its breadth and beauty, this street is considered the city's pride and one of the most beautiful streets in the Americas.

    Thousands of luxurious high-rise buildings are connected along the street. Government agencies, shipping companies and airline offices, large hotels, cafes... are all on this street; there is also a municipal market that sells everything: here, from the ram's horn used by ordinary people to ward off evil and seek good fortune to tender slices of fresh beef, anything can be bought. The shop windows of the large stores are decorated with a dazzling array of goods. Especially the jewelry stores, which often attract passersby. Brazil has always been known as the "Land of Many Treasures." Diamonds have been discovered for more than two hundred years, and in recent years, the output has exceeded two million carats. Gemstones come in red, yellow, blue, purple, and various other colors, the most precious of which is called "aquamarine." Crystal is also a Brazilian specialty, with an annual output of two thousand four to five hundred tons. Gold mines were discovered as early as the early eighteenth century, and the current output is nearly five million grams per year. No wonder Brazilian women pay attention to wearing jewelry, and it is common to see them dangling a body full of jewels.

    The car slowed down at a busy intersection, and the driver pointed to a streamlined building of twenty stories and told us that it was the American Embassy, ​​and said that he squeezed his right thumb into his left palm, making a face. We all smiled knowingly. This is a gesture that everyone in Brazil understands: thief!

    This expression of dissatisfaction with the United States by the driver is not an isolated case in Brazil. Many Brazilians refuse to smoke American cigarettes and insist on smoking locally made cigarettes. In the hotel, we heard Brazilians saying in an annoyed tone more than once: "I want 'Guarana' (a Brazilian drink, like cherry water), not Coca-Cola!"

    Brazilians' dissatisfaction with the United States is directly proportional to the expansion of American power in Brazil. Currently, many sectors of Brazil's basic economy are controlled by American companies. For example, Brazil's major rubber factories belong to "Goodyear" and "Firestone"; "General Electric" controls the production of Brazilian electrical equipment and light bulbs; American automobile trusts have their own automobile manufacturing plants in Brazil. In Brazil's import and export trade, the United States has accounted for about 50% of Brazil's total import and export value in recent years. The United States prevents Brazil from freely selling its goods in the American market, and uses "Marshall Plan" "aid" to crowd out certain Brazilian commodities (such as cotton) in the European market. Brazilians get angry when they talk about these things. Once, when we passed the Brazilian tobacco factory, a Brazilian friend introduced indignantly, "This factory is American in everything except the name is Brazilian! Capital, profits...". In fact, it is very common for American companies to adopt this kind of deceptive approach. The arrogance and unreasonableness of Americans are also very annoying to Brazilians. I happened to talk to some employees of Brazilian companies about how fluent their English was, but I didn't expect it to cause the young men to complain: "We learn English to deal with American gentlemen, but it's killing people. Americans only allow us to listen and not to speak; and what we hear is all annoying words!" "One day we will have to let them listen to Brazilians speak!" A young employee said, even shaking his fist.

    The wealthy people of Rio de Janeiro mostly live in the north and south of the city center, where the roads are wide, and there are beautiful villas among the lush trees and flowers. Well-decorated and beautiful gardens and promenades are also mostly in these areas.

    To the west of the city center is the ordinary citizen residential area, and many places still retain traces of old Rio de Janeiro: roads paved with small stones, alleys too narrow to drive cars through, old small churches... Every morning, black women's handcarts and hawkers' stalls form a lively temporary market on the streets. People sell fresh vegetables, fruits, freshly caught fish, shrimp, wooden clogs, straw hats... and flowers planted in empty cans in melodious tones. The things here are of good quality and low price and do not bargain, so they attract many customers.

    What we saw in the suburbs was a completely different world. It is far from the city center, and there is not a single tall tree to be seen, or even a relatively complete house. Rows of small wooden houses nailed together stand crookedly on the barren slopes overgrown with weeds. Dark, damp, some without even windows; not to mention water and electricity. People use beer barrels to roll to the river to fetch water to drink and use. Nearby is a foul-smelling ditch. Small children in tattered clothes play in the dusty groves, and when they see strangers coming, they shyly whisper: "I want a piece of candy!"

    Black poor people live on the slopes up and down. Many people still have to travel a long way to work near the city every day, but there is no way. In their words, "If it's not far away, you can't find a house," or "If it's not far away, you can't afford a house even if there is one." Just like these dilapidated small houses in the suburbs, the rent alone accounts for half of the monthly salary (the average monthly salary of workers is 3,500 Cruzeiros, which is more than 40 US dollars). The difficulty of life can be imagined. And according to Brazilian friends, many black people live in small houses built of red soil in the back mountains, and their lives are even more miserable than here.

    里约热内卢印象
    萧光
    早上八点半从乌拉圭的首都蒙得维的亚起飞，不到一个钟头就进入了巴西的上空。飞机几乎是沿着巴西漫长的海岸线飞行。棕红色的马尔山脉离海岸不远，山峦连接着山峦；我们不时越过一座又一座濒海的城市，白墙红顶的房子深深地埋藏在茂密的热带植物当中。沿海星罗棋布似的布满了大大小小的岛屿。大西洋就在右边，从高处望下去风平浪静，很像一块大得没边的绿色毛玻璃。
    我们在巴西南方的重要港口阿雷格累稍稍休息，随后改乘四个引擎的大飞机直飞里约热内卢，下午三点多到达了目的地。
    虽然我们已经沿着巴西的海岸整整地飞行了四个多小时，但还没飞到它全长的四分之一。巴西真不愧是拉丁美洲最大的国家。它的国土三百二十八万多方哩，几乎占南美洲面积的一半，比整个欧洲大陆还大。南美洲十个国家，除了智利和厄瓜多尔，其他八个国家都和巴西接壤：委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚和圭亚那在它的北面；秘鲁和玻利维亚在它的西面；南和西南是巴拉圭、阿根廷和乌拉圭。东和东北是大西洋，它的长达四千多哩的海岸线终年被碧绿的海水冲涮着。在这辽阔无际的大地上，63％是浓密的森林；世界第二长河亚马孙河从东部向西横贯大陆，流入大西洋，它的长度超过四千哩。
    由于地势的多种多样和气候的变换迷离，巴西的物产也丰富而齐全：咖啡、棉花、可可、玉蜀黍、稻子、糖、水果、木材（特别是硬木）、橡胶，还有铁、煤、石油、镍、钨、锰、锌、石碱等矿产，简直是无所不有。咖啡占巴西每年出口总额的一半，世界各地饮用的咖啡约五分之三是巴西供给的。
    巴西的人口五千九百多万，相当于南美洲其他各国人数的总和；不同的是巴西黑人多，黑人和白人与黑人的混血种占到总人口的40％左右，他们说着统一的葡萄牙话。
    里约热内卢在巴西的东南，是一个背山面海的凹形大港，也是南美洲最大的船只停泊中心。海湾深深地楔入大港，城市在高山和大海之间沿着险阻的海岸曲折伸展六、七哩。甜面包山的两个一千多呎的高峰矗峙海中，周围环绕许多岩石小岛，形成一扇天然的险要门户。1502年元月1日，葡萄牙的远征队初次来到这里，还以为是一条大河的出口，便将它叫作“里约热内卢”，意思是“元月的河”。
    海滨大道像一条项链似的随港湾而曲折，两旁种着无数株五、六丈高的棕榈树。我们住的旅馆就在这条街上，打开窗户可以时时欣赏远山近水的景色。这里的雾气很重，不论天晴下雨，远望出去常是灰蒙蒙的一片。我们在这儿住了十多天，始终不曾清清楚楚地看到一次甜面包山的轮廓。只有悬空过海的电缆车，因为它闪闪发光，还隐约可见。旅馆背后的驼峰也是里约热内卢的一大名胜，在二千三百七十二呎高的顶上竖立着一座伸着胳膊的巨大的耶稣像。夜晚，探照灯一打，从很远的地方都望得见。
    这里要到9月21日才开春。现在虽说还是冬末，却很有北京初夏的意思了。温度一般在摄氏25°—30°之间。晴天穿单衣还出汗，在太阳底下更热。
    也许是怕热的关系，巴西人特别喜欢游泳和洗海水澡。我们常看见换上了游泳衣的男男女女，光着脚穿过马路到海滨去。那里，彩色的遮阳大伞和一排排小木头房子把海滩点缀得很漂亮。人们打球的打球，晒太阳的晒太阳，还有的在水中追逐游嬉。这情景实在让人很难把它跟冬天的概念联在一起。
    巴西朋友陪我们坐汽车去游览市容。
    里约热内卢大致可以划成三部分：中心区，这是市的商业和行政管理的心脏；围绕着它而发展开去的是住宅区、郊区。
    一哩多长的白河大街是全市最主要的街道，自西北向南斜贯市中心。高大的巴西木排列成行，人行道用五颜六色的石子铺出各种图案。这条街因为它的宽广和美丽，被认为是城市的骄傲和美洲最漂亮的街道之一。
    成千幢豪华的高楼大厦沿街连成一气。政府机关、轮船公司和航空公司的办事处、大饭店、咖啡馆……都在这条街上；还有无所不卖的市立商场：这里，从老百姓用来避邪求吉的公羊的角一直到肥嫩的鲜牛肉片，什么都可以买到。大商店的橱窗布置得琳琅满目。特别是首饰店，经常吸引着路人。巴西一向有“多宝之邦”的称号。金刚石已经发现了二百多年，这些年来产量超过了两万克拉。宝石红、黄、蓝、紫各种颜色的都有，最名贵的叫“海水绿”。水晶石也是巴西名产，每年出产两千四、五百吨。黄金矿早在十八世纪初期就发现了，现在产量每年近五百万克。难怪巴西的妇女讲究佩戴首饰，常见她们叮铃噹啷地挂了一身珠宝。
    汽车在热闹的交叉路口放缓速度，司机指着一座二十来层的流线型大厦告诉我们，那是美国大使馆，说着把右拇指往左手心使劲一攒，扮了一个鬼脸。我们大家会心地笑了起来。这是巴西人人都懂得的一个手势：小偷！
    司机流露的这种对美国的不满情绪，在巴西并不是个别的。许多巴西人拒绝吸美国香烟而坚持抽当地土制的烟卷。在饭店里，我们不止一次地听到巴西人带着厌烦口气说：“要‘瓜惹那’（一种巴西饮料，像樱桃水），不要可口可乐！”
    巴西人对美国的不满和美国势力在巴西的扩张成为正比。目前，巴西基本经济的许多部门都掌握在美国公司的手里。比如，巴西主要的橡胶厂属于“固得异公司”、“法斯通公司”；“通用电气公司”控制着巴西电工器材和电灯泡的生产；美国汽车托辣斯在巴西有它自己的汽车制造厂。在巴西的进出口贸易中，近年来美国一直占到巴西进出口总值的50％左右。美国使巴西在美洲市场上不能自由地销售它的货物，又在欧洲市场利用“马歇尔计划”的“援助”排挤巴西的某些商品（例如棉花）。这些事，巴西人提起来就生气。有一次，我们走过巴西烟草工厂，巴西朋友愤愤地介绍道，“这工厂除了名字叫巴西，什么都是美国的！资本、利润……。”实际上，美国公司采取这种挂羊头卖狗肉的方式很普遍。美国人的傲慢无理也很使巴西人讨厌。我曾偶然和巴西一些公司的职员谈起他们的英语说得流利，不想竟引起了小伙子们的满腹牢骚：“我们学英文是为了和美国先生打交道，结果却把人快憋死了。美国人只许我们听听不许我们说；听的又全是一些气人的话！”“总有一天也得请他们听听巴西人讲话！”一位年青的职员说的时候甚至晃了晃拳头。
    里约热内卢的有钱人大都住在市中心的南北，那里马路宽广，丰茂的树木花草当中是漂亮的别墅。修饰得整齐和美丽的花园、散步场也多半在这些地带。
    市中心区的西面是普通的市民住宅区，许多地方还保留着老里约热内卢的痕迹：小石子铺的路面，窄得开不进去汽车的胡同，古老的小教堂……。每天早上黑人妇女们的手推车和小贩的地摊在街头组成一个个热闹的临时小市。人们用悦耳的声调叫卖着新鲜的蔬菜、水果、刚出海的鱼、虾、木屐鞋、草帽……还有种在空罐头里的花。这儿的东西物美价廉而且不讲价钱，所以招揽不少顾客。
    我们在郊外看到的完全是另外一个世界。这里距离市中心区很远，看不见一棵高大的树，甚至没有一幢比较完整的房子。在荒草蔓生的土坡上歪歪斜斜的竖着一排排木板钉成的小屋。黑暗，潮湿，有的连窗子都没有；更别提水电设备了。人们用盛啤酒的木桶滚到河边去装水回来喝用。附近就是臭气熏人的水沟。衣服褴褛的小孩子就在满是尘土的矮树林里玩耍，看到生人过来，羞怯地小声喊道：“我要一块糖！”
    土坡上下住的是黑人贫民。许多人每天还得老远地跑到市区附近去上班，但也没有法子。照他们的话说：“不远找不到房子”，或“不远，有房子也住不起”。就像郊外这种破破烂烂的小屋，每月光房租就占去了工资的一半（工人每月工资一般是三千五百个克鲁赛罗，合四十多美元）。生活的困难，可以想见。而据巴西朋友说，许多黑人住在后山红土砌成的小屋里，他们的生活比这里还苦得多。
