    Visiting Jie Garden to See Chrysanthemums
    Shanying
    Stepping through the gates of Jie Garden [Note], four or five plasterers were repairing the surrounding wall. There were no chrysanthemums in bloom in the garden. Perhaps it was not yet the peak blooming season for chrysanthemums. I felt a bit regretful that I had come at the wrong time. Guided by a gardener, I passed through fruit trees and greenhouses to a quaint little study – the Yanling Hall. While the gardener went inside to announce my arrival, I took a look around the study. The walls were covered with calligraphy and paintings about chrysanthemums. There wasn't a single pot of chrysanthemums in the room, yet I seemed to see the beauty of chrysanthemums and smell their fragrance. This was a world of chrysanthemums. After a moment, the door behind me creaked open, and an elderly man with white hair and beard walked in with a smiling face. This was Mr. Liu Jieyuan, the owner of Jie Garden – a famous chrysanthemum cultivation expert in Beijing, who has been growing chrysanthemums since 1932 for more than twenty years. The old man is now seventy-two years old, but still so robust. After I explained my purpose, he said with a smile: "I can tell you a lot about chrysanthemums. It's a pity you came early. If you come back in about twenty days, you can see many chrysanthemums here. Now only dozens of pots of short-day chrysanthemums are in bloom."

    He took me to the exhibition room in front – the Yangzhi Lodge, where dozens of pots of chrysanthemums were placed, in yellow, white, red, pink, and purple; some with one flower per plant, some with several flowers, and some with hundreds of flowers; some like a round red sun, some like stars in the sky; some taller than a person, some as short as the knees; some as large as peonies, some as small as peach blossoms; the petals were of various types such as open petals, drooping petals, broad petals, and curled petals.

    Mr. Jieyuan said: Cultivating chrysanthemums is an art, and also hard work. In winter, the soil is turned over; in spring, seeds are sown; fertilizing, pest control, potting, pruning, and watering are required. When the flowers are in full bloom, one must personally hybridize and pollinate them. On windy and rainy nights, one has to get up in the middle of the night to move them from places exposed to the rain to places sheltered from the rain. He said that each variety has its own characteristics. Some like to be exposed to the sun more, some don't like to be exposed to the sun, some need more water, and some need less water. A chrysanthemum grower must know their different personalities as a mother knows her own children; otherwise, she is not a "good mother."

    We walked into another small room, where poems and lyrics praising chrysanthemums by poets of past dynasties were posted. Qu Yuan, Tao Yuanming, Du Fu, Bai Letian, Su Dongpo, Lu Fangweng, which one hasn't praised chrysanthemums! The poets used the chrysanthemum's spirit of withstanding the westerly wind and frost to bloom alone to compare it to our nation's spirit of not fearing tyranny. The old man said: "The Classic of Herbal Medicine, Classic of Mountains and Seas, Erya and Book of Rites all have records about chrysanthemums, so Chinese chrysanthemums have a history of more than three thousand years. At that time, chrysanthemums were only single-petaled and single-colored (yellow and white). After the long-term cultivation and continuous variation by the people, by the Song Dynasty, there were dozens of varieties, and by the Ming Dynasty, there were more than two hundred varieties. Now there are thousands of varieties. Chrysanthemums are the most varied of flowers." In Jie Garden, there are already over a thousand varieties of chrysanthemums. The old man is cultivating new varieties to make the shape of chrysanthemums more beautiful and varied. Our horticulturists, according to the short-day nature of chrysanthemums, have been able to make chrysanthemums bloom earlier. Now there are not only autumn chrysanthemums, but also spring and summer chrysanthemums. Mr. Jieyuan can make chrysanthemums bloom whenever he wants them to bloom. This year, on National Day, there were chrysanthemums from Jie Garden on Tiananmen Square. At the garden party in the Summer Palace welcoming President Sukarno and Prime Minister Acharya, there were also chrysanthemums from Jie Garden.

    Mr. Jieyuan told me that chrysanthemums can not only be admired, but also used as beverages, food, and medicine. He said with a smile: "Chrysanthemums can also be greatly studied!"

    Returning to the study, he showed me the calligraphy and poems written by Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Zhu, Premier Zhou, and others. He said: "Since 1950, these leaders have come here. They said this endeavor is beneficial to the people." Last year, he held a chrysanthemum exhibition, and thousands of people came to visit, including foreign guests, cadres, workers, painters, students, and Young Pioneers. Now he is preparing for this year's chrysanthemum exhibition.

    "Jie Garden has a thousand kinds of chrysanthemums, planted by Liu Jun himself; the rare flowers are happily appreciated by the public, smiling and waiting for people to come." This is a poem given to him by Vice Chairman Zhu.

    Note: Jie 字 is pronounced "Jie", which is equivalent to "洁 (jie)". (Attached picture)

    ?园看菊
    山鹰
    走进?园〔注〕的大门，四、五个泥水工人正在修理围墙。园里不见开放的菊花，也许还未到菊花盛开的时候吧，心里有点后悔来得非时。经一位花匠引导，穿过果树和花房，到了一间古色古香的小书房——延龄馆。乘着花匠入内通报的机会，我先把书房流览了一遍。满壁都是关于菊的字和画。室内没有放一盆菊花，然而我似乎已看到菊的美，闻到菊的香。这里是菊的世界。一会儿，背后的门呀的一声，一位须发花白的长者满脸笑容地走进来，这就是?园主人刘?园先生——北京著名的养菊专家，从1932年开始种菊，至今已有二十多年。今年老人已达七十二岁高龄，但还是那样健壮。当我说明了来意后，他笑着说：“关于菊花，我可以告诉你很多。可惜你来得早了，如果再隔那么二十天，你在这儿就可以看到很多菊花了。现在只有几十盆用短日照的菊花开放。”
    他带我到前面的展览室——仰止庐去，那里放着数十盆菊花，有黄的、白的、红的、粉的、紫的；有一株一花的，一株数花的，一株百花的；有的像一轮红日，有的像满天繁星；有高过一人的，矮及膝窝的；大的如牡丹，小的如桃花；瓣有张瓣、弛瓣、宽瓣、卷瓣等。
    ?园先生说：养菊是艺术，也是辛勤的劳动。冬天翻土，春天播种，要施肥、驱虫、登盆、修剪、浇水，当花盛开时，要亲手为花杂交授粉，遇到风雨之夜，还要半夜起床，把它们由淋雨的地方搬到背雨的地方。他说，每一种品种都有它自己的特性，有的爱多晒，有的不爱多晒，有的要多水，有的要少水。一个养菊的人，要像母亲熟悉自己的孩子那样熟悉它们不同的个性，否则就不是“好母亲”。
    走到另一间小房子里，那里贴满了我国历代诗人吟菊的诗和词，屈原、陶渊明、杜甫、白乐天、苏东坡、陆放翁，哪一个没有吟咏过菊呵！诗人们以菊花的抗西风寒霜而独放的精神来比拟我们民族不畏强暴的气魄。老人说：“本草经、山海经、尔雅和礼记上都有关于菊的记载，所以中国的菊，已有三千年以上的历史了。那时的菊花只是单瓣和单色（黄色和白色）的，经过人民的长期培植，不断变种，到宋代，已有几十种，到明代，已有二百多种，现在已有数千种了。菊是花中品种最多的。”在?园，菊花的品种已经上千了。老人正在培植新的品种，使菊花的形态变得更美丽多姿。我国的园艺家们，根据菊花短日照的习性，已能把菊花提前开放了，现在不仅有秋菊，还有春菊和夏菊。?园先生要菊花什么时候开，就会使它什么时候开。今年国庆节，天安门上就有?园的菊，在颐和园欢迎苏加诺总统、阿查里雅首相的游园大会上，也有?园的菊。
    ?园老人告诉我，菊花不仅可以欣赏，也可以作饮料、食料、药料。他笑着说：“菊花还大可以研究呢！”
    回到书房，他拿毛主席、朱副主席、周总理等题的字和诗给我看。他说：“从1950年以来，这几位领导人都来过。他们说这事业对人民有利。”去年他开了一次菊展，有几千人来参观，他们有外宾、干部、工人、画家、学生、少先队员。现在他正在筹备今年的菊展哩。
    “?园千种菊，刘君手自栽；奇花欣众赏，含笑待人开。”这是朱副主席赠给他的一首诗。
