Xinhua News Agency report: Recently, an interesting machine was installed in the home laboratory of Cheng Weimin, a young engineer in Shanghai. Like a silkworm, it can continuously spin out strands of pure white and soft filament—glass fiber filament that is much finer than silk.

Cheng Weimin said that this glass fiber filament is made from a special glass with considerable hardness that is melted as the raw material. Yarn spun from this filament and cloth woven from it are stronger than ordinary gauze and retain the original non-combustible, non-water-absorbing, oil-resistant, and acid-resistant properties of glass. Using this filament as insulation for generator magnetic wires provides much higher insulation capacity than using ordinary gauze. Manufacturing the outer shells of automobiles, trains, and ships by die-casting this gauze together with plastic would prevent oxidation and rotting for hundreds of years. Clothing made from this gauze would be lighter and provide better insulation and heat resistance than asbestos clothing.

The glass for manufacturing advanced glass fiber filament must be melted at a high temperature of over 1300 degrees Celsius. Foreign countries generally use expensive platinum crucibles to melt glass and draw filaments. Based on the existing domestic conditions, Cheng Weimin trial-produced a white pottery crucible costing less than 50 cents to replace the platinum crucible. The other parts of this machine were also assembled using parts and instruments from automobiles and bicycles.

In China, the glass fiber industry is newly emerging after liberation. So far, the glass fibers produced by various factories are many times coarser than silk and cannot be spun or woven. The one successfully trial-produced by Cheng Weimin can be spun and woven.

Cheng Weimin is an engineer at the jointly owned state-private Simei Glass Fiber Factory. This time, his trial production of advanced glass fiber was carried out with the support of the Shanghai Telecommunications and Electrical Appliance Industry Company. Now, the relevant departments have specially allocated him 10,000 yuan as funds for further trial production.

### 青年工程师程伟民制成高级玻璃纤维丝

    青年工程师程伟民制成高级玻璃纤维丝
    据新华社讯　在上海的一个青年工程师程伟民的家庭实验室里，最近安装了一台有趣的机器。它能够像家蚕一样连续不断地吐出一缕缕洁白柔软的细丝——比蚕丝还要细得多的玻璃纤维丝。
    程伟民说，这种玻璃纤维丝是用一种硬度相当高的特殊玻璃熔化以后做原料的。用这种丝纺成线、织成布，比一般纱布还要坚牢，并且保留着玻璃原有的不燃烧、不吸收水分、不怕油、不怕酸等特性。用这种丝作发电机磁线的绝缘材料，绝缘能力比用普通纱布的高得多。用这种纱布同塑胶一起压铸以后制造汽车、火车、船只的外壳，即使用上几百年也不会受氧化而腐烂。用这种纱布做成衣服，能够比石棉衣更轻、更能够保暖隔热。
    制造高级玻璃纤维丝的玻璃，要在摄氏一千三百度以上的高温下才能熔化。国外制造这种玻璃丝，一般都用高贵的白金（铂）坩锅来熔化玻璃和拉丝的。程伟民根据国内现有条件，试制了一种成本不到五角钱的白陶土，锅来代替白金坩锅。这台机器的其他部分，也是用汽车、脚踏车上的零件、仪表装配成功的。
    在我国，玻璃纤维工业是解放以后才新兴起来的。到目前为止，各厂生产的玻璃纤维，比蚕丝粗好多倍，都不能纺纱织布。程伟民试制成功的则可以纺纱织布。
    程伟民是公私合营斯美玻璃纤维厂的工程师。他这一次试制高级玻璃纤维，是在上海市电讯电器工业公司支持下进行的。现在，有关部门特拨给他一万元作为进一步试制的经费。
