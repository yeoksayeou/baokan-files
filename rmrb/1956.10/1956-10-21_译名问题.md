	Translation Problems
	Feng Ming
	Some people enjoy reading translated novels but find foreign names a major headache. Taking Soviet names as an example, besides the surname and given name, there's also the patronymic, and the given name has both formal names and nicknames, endearing terms, etc., which are far less pleasing to the eye and easier to pronounce than names like "Zhao Ziyue" and "Qian Kuoting." Therefore, some suggest that when translating foreign works, it's best to simplify the names. But I think it's unnecessary, and it shouldn't be simplified. Reading foreign works, besides learning from them ideologically and artistically, we should also understand foreign customs and cultures. If we find even the way to call foreign names troublesome and don't want to understand it, then why bother reading foreign works at all?
	As for one person having several translations of their name, such as Pechorin and Bai Chaolin, Yevgeny and Eugene, or even inconsistent translations within the same work, sometimes Alyosha, sometimes Alyoshka, that's another matter. This is something that translators should communicate more about and be more mindful of in their writing.

    译名问题
    冯明
    有一些人爱读翻译小说，但对外国人名深感头痛。以苏联人名字为例，除了姓氏、名字之外，还有父称，而且名字除了正名之外，又有爱称、卑称等，远没有“赵子曰”“钱阔亭”之类的名字来得顺眼、上口。于是有人建议：翻译外国作品，人名最好简化。但我以为不必，而且也不应该简化的。阅读外国作品，除了从思想上，艺术上吸取教益外，也应该了解外国的风俗人情。如果连外国人的名字怎样叫法，都嫌麻烦而不想去了解，那又何必去读外国作品？
    至于一人数种译名，如彼巧林之与白曹林，叶甫盖尼之与欧根之类，甚至在同一作品中译名也前后不一，忽而阿廖沙，忽而阿略夏之类，那是另一个问题。这点倒是应该请翻译家们多通些声气，笔下多留一点儿神的。
