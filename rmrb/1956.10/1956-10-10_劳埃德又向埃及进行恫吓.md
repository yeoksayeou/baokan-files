Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from New York: After President Nasser's talk on the CBS television program on the 7th, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd then gave a talk on the same company's television program, threatening Egypt not to get close to socialist countries.

Lloyd said that imposing economic sanctions on Egypt would undoubtedly bring Egypt closer to socialist countries, "However, this is a course of action that he (Nasser) has brought upon himself, and I think it fills Egypt's future with very serious responsibilities and very serious risks."

　　劳埃德又向埃及进行恫吓
    新华社9日讯　纽约消息：在纳赛尔总统7日对美国哥伦比亚广播公司电视节目发表谈话后，英国外交大臣劳埃德接着在同一个公司的电视节目里发表谈话，恐吓埃及不要靠近社会主义国家。
    劳埃德说，对埃及施行经济制裁无疑会使埃及更靠近社会主义国家，“但是，这是一个他（纳赛尔）自己找的行动方针，我认为它使埃及的前途充满着非常严重的责任和非常严重的冒险”。
