    Dispelling "Concerns"
    Kong Fei
    Using the method of adding notes to phrases, we can add the following annotations to "concerns": looking forward and backward, caught in a dilemma, harboring doubts and fears, being hesitant to move forward.
    There are many kinds of concerns. Concerns about personal gains and losses make people cautious and shortsighted. As a result, they either become slaves to the will of others, becoming pitiful responders, or burdened down, struggling to move forward, becoming utter "bound-feet women."
    However, there is another kind of concern. For example, when there are obvious shortcomings or errors in leadership, public criticism is not allowed—for fear of damaging the leader's "prestige." In work summaries, reports, and the like, it is necessary to first affirm that "achievements are the main thing," for fear of undermining the "confidence" of the masses. Certain opinions of Party and League members must not be raised "arbitrarily," for fear of creating a bad "influence" among the masses. And this kind of concern is justified by the excuse of "starting from the work," in order to prolong its life.
    Thus, the "prestige" of the leadership is silently maintained, the masses are "well-behaved" under strong encouragement, and Party and League members become "perfect beings."
    But over time, one cannot help but throw out the baby with the bathwater, subjectively "starting from the work," but objectively setting stumbling blocks for the work. You might as well first ask yourself: "Do I really believe in the masses?"

    解“顾虑”
    孔非
    用举词加注的方法，可以给“顾虑”加上如下的注释：瞻前顾后、进退维谷、心存疑惧、裹足不前。
    顾虑有种种。个人得失的顾虑，使人变得谨小慎微、目光如豆。其结果，不是变成别人意志的奴隶，成为可悲的应声者，便是重负在身，步履艰难，成为十足的“小脚女人”。
    但，也有另外一种顾虑。比如领导上有显而易见的缺点或错误，不许公开批评——怕有损于领导者的“威信”。工作总结、报告之类，必须首先肯定“成绩是主要的”，怕打击了群众的“信心”。党、团员的某些意见，不得“任意”提出，怕在群众中造成不良“影响”。而这种顾虑又是借口“从工作出发”，以延其寿命的。
    于是，则领导上的“威信”在无声中得以维护，群众在大力鼓励之下“循规蹈矩”，党、团员成为“完人”。
    但是长此以往，终不免因噎废食，主观上“从工作出发”，客观上却为工作立下了绊脚石。不妨先扪心自问：“我到底是否相信群众？”
