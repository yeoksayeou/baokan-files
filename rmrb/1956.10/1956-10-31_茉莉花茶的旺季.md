The peak season for jasmine tea

    (Our report) Fuzhou Tea Factory, a state-owned enterprise in Fujian Province, has its tea workers working day and night in shifts to scent various flower teas, including trifoliate orange flower tea, Emei flower tea, and special grade flower tea. In the past, Fujian flower tea was only sold to North and Northeast China, but now it has expanded to twenty-four provinces and cities, and some is also sold abroad. It is estimated that this year's flower tea production in Fujian Province will increase by 20% compared to last year. (Lin Feng)

    茉莉花茶的旺季
    本报讯　福建省国营福州茶厂的制茶工人最近正在夜以继日分班赶窨各类花茶，包括玳玳花茶，峨眉花茶和特级花茶等品种。以往福建花茶只运销华北和东北等地，现在已扩大到二十四个省、市，还有部分运销国外。预计今年福建省花茶生产量将比去年增加二成。　（林烽）
