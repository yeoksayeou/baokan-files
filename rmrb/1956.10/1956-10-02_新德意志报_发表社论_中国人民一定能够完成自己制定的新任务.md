Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 1st. "Neues Deutschland" published an editorial on September 30th entitled "The People's Republic of China After Seven Years." The editorial first pointed out the successive arrival of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the 1956 Chinese National Day and then recounted the achievements of the People's Republic of China in the seven years since its founding. The editorial expressed its belief that the Chinese people will certainly be able to accomplish the new tasks they have set for themselves in the future.

The newspaper said: It is a matter of pride to call such a great and strong country a friend. The editorial pointed out: The sincere friendship between the German Democratic Republic and China has deep roots. The Marxist-Leninist worldview, as well as the common struggle to safeguard peace, build socialism, and consolidate the socialist camp, link the two countries together. The desire of the two peoples to conduct closer cooperation is clearly expressed in the Treaty on Friendship and Mutual Assistance Cooperation signed at the end of last year. Through this treaty, the German Democratic Republic has gained a powerful ally in the struggle to achieve the reunification of Germany and oppose the imperialists and the militarist elements of West Germany. The editorial said: Another clear expression of the powerful support for our struggle is the huge protest movement of the Chinese working people against the banning of the German Communist Party.

The editorial concluded: The German working people, taking advantage of the opportunity for their Chinese friends to celebrate National Day, congratulate the Chinese people on achieving complete victory in realizing the great tasks stipulated by the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which is beneficial to China and to all peace-loving people.

    “新德意志报”发表社论
    中国人民一定能够完成自己制定的新任务
    新华社柏林1日电　“新德意志报”9月30日发表了一篇题目是“七年来的中华人民共和国”的社论。社论首先指出中国共产党第八次全国代表大会和1956年中国国庆节的相继来临，并且追述了中华人民共和国建国七年以来的成就。社论表示相信中国人民今后一定能够完成他们自己所制定的新的任务。
    这家报纸说：把这样一个伟大和强盛的国家称为朋友是一种骄傲。社论指出：德意志民主共和国和中国之间的真诚友谊有着深刻的根源。马克思列宁主义的世界观以及维护和平、建设社会主义和巩固社会主义阵营的共同斗争，把两国联结在一起。两国人民进行更密切的合作的愿望清楚地表现在去年年底签订的关于友好与互助合作的条约上。通过这项条约，德意志民主共和国在争取德国的重新统一，反对帝国主义者和西德的军国主义分子的斗争中得到了一个强大的盟国。社论说：对我们的斗争的有力支持的另一次明显表示就是中国劳动人民对禁止德国共产党的巨大抗议运动。
    社论最后说：德国劳动人民趁中国朋友们欢度国庆的机会，祝贺中国人民在实现中国共产党第八次全国代表大会所规定的有利于中国和有利于所有爱好和平的人民的伟大任务中获得完全的胜利。
