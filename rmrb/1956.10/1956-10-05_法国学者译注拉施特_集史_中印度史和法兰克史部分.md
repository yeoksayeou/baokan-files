The "Jami al-Tarawikh" (also known as "Compendium of Chronicles") written by the 14th-century Persian historian Raschid-eddin (1247-1318), includes, besides the histories of the Mongols and the Ilkhanate, histories of India and the Franks. However, these parts have rarely been utilized. K. Jahn, a French scholar studying Raschid-eddin's works, published his German-translated and annotated part of the "History of the Ilkhanate" in Prague in 1941, and in 1951 he published his French-translated and annotated part of the "History of the Franks" at Leiden University in the Netherlands. Although this part is called "History of the Franks," it is actually a medieval history of the whole of Europe. Jahn is also currently proofreading the "History of India" section.

Raschid-eddin initially served as a physician to Ilkhan Ghazan, and later became Prime Minister. During the reign of Busain Khan, he was falsely accused and executed by dismemberment. The "Jami al-Tarawikh" was written in Persian under the order of Ghazan Khan as a "universal history." The book is divided into three parts: the first part is the history of the Mongols, including the origins of the Mongol people, the deeds of Genghis Khan and subsequent Khans, ending with the reign of Yuan Chengzong in China and the death of Ghazan Khan in the Ilkhanate; the second part is world history, including the European countries and India; the third part is a gazetteer. The "Jami al-Tarawikh" is based on materials such as the "Golden Book," a collection of original Mongol historical materials preserved in the archives of the Ilkhanate, Juvaini's "History of the World Conqueror," and historical materials provided by astronomers and historians from China, India, Kashmir, Tibet, Uyghur, Arab, and European countries residing in the Ilkhanate. The Mongol history part is one of the most important historical materials for studying Mongol history. Although there are several translations of this part, none are complete. (Ran)

    法国学者译注拉施特“集史”中印度史和法兰克史部分
    十四世纪波斯的历史学家拉施特·丁（1247—1318）所著的“集史”（又名“年代汇纪”）一书，除了蒙古史、伊儿汗国史以外，还有印度史、法兰克史等。但是，这些部分很少有人利用过。法国研究拉施特著作的学者杨（K·Jahn）氏，曾在1941年把他用德文译注的
  “伊儿汗国史”部分在布拉格出版，1951年又把他用法文译注的“法兰克史”部分在荷兰莱丁大学出版。这一部分虽然名为“法兰克史”，实际上是整个欧洲的中世纪史。“印度史”部分，杨氏也正在校译中。
    拉施特·丁初为伊儿汗国合赞汗的侍医，后为宰相。在不赛因汗时，他被人诬陷而遭到腰斩。所著
  “集史”一书是受合赞汗之命用波斯文写的一部“世界通史”。全书分为三部，第一部是蒙古史，包括蒙古族的起源，成吉思汗及其以后诸汗的事迹，在中国止于元成宗时，在伊儿汗国止于合赞汗之死；第二部是世界史，包括欧洲诸国和印度；第三部是地志。“集史”所根据的材料有伊儿汗国档案库中所藏的蒙古原始史料“金册”，术外尼的“世界侵略者传”，以及居留在伊儿汗国的中国、印度、克什米尔、西藏、维吾尔、阿拉伯和欧洲诸国的天文学者、历史学者所供给的史料。其中蒙古史部分，是研究蒙古史的重要史料之一。关于这一部分，虽有几种译本，但是都没译完。（然）
