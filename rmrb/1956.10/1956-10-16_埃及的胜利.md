    Egypt's Victory
    The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted six principles for resolving the Suez Canal issue. These six principles were agreed upon in secret talks between Egypt, Britain, and France. As long as everyone adheres to these six principles, there will be a good foundation for the peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue.
    The most important point of the six principles is the clear recognition of Egypt's unwavering sovereignty over the Suez Canal. The issue of sovereignty is the key to whether the Suez Canal issue can be resolved peacefully. Affirming Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal can resolve the dispute; denying it, or only acknowledging Egypt's sovereignty in words but not in practice, cannot resolve the problem. The fundamental reason why the Suez Canal issue has remained unresolved for the past two months is that Britain, France, and the United States have attempted to infringe upon Egypt's sovereignty and seize the Suez Canal in order to achieve their colonialist goals. Facts have proven that this path is unworkable. Now that Britain, France, and the United States have agreed to the principle of respecting Egypt's sovereignty at the United Nations Security Council meeting, it should be said that they are being wise.
    However, while agreeing to the six principles in the proposal submitted to the Security Council, Britain and France insisted that the Security Council approve the so-called "Eighteen-Nation Proposal" that had already been rejected by Egypt. This is their attempt to return to the starting point after taking a step forward. The self-contradictory action of Britain and France, acknowledging that Egypt's sovereignty should be respected while trying to obliterate it in concrete actions, is clearly intended to create obstacles to the peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue based on these principles. This approach by Britain and France is very foolish. The active support of the United States for the latter part of the British and French proposal shows that it is unwilling to ease the current tense situation in the Middle East.
    This attitude of Britain, France, and the United States was resolutely opposed by the representatives of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. The part of the British and French proposal that required the Security Council to recognize the "Eighteen-Nation Proposal" was vetoed by the Soviet Union, which enabled the Security Council to finally contribute to the peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue. The actions of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in upholding the principles of the United Nations Charter and striving for a peaceful resolution based on respect for Egypt's sovereignty reflect the common aspirations of peace-loving people around the world.
    The six principles adopted by the United Nations Security Council on the negotiated settlement of the Suez Canal issue are a major victory for the Egyptian people in their struggle to safeguard their sovereignty, and also the result of the efforts of the people of all countries to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue. Now, the Security Council should urge all parties concerned, especially Britain, France, and the United States, to immediately begin peaceful negotiations on the Suez Canal issue based on the six principles. It is hoped that Britain and France can see the situation clearly, abandon any intention of infringing upon Egypt's sovereignty, and honestly negotiate with Egypt. Any means of creating obstacles or complications will only be more detrimental to themselves.

    埃及的胜利
    联合国安全理事会一致通过了解决苏伊士运河问题的六项原则。这六项原则是在埃及同英、法进行的秘密会谈中达成协议的。只要大家都信守这六项原则，和平解决苏伊士运河问题就有了良好的基础。
    六项原则中最主要之点是明确地承认了埃及对苏伊士运河的不可动摇的主权。而主权问题正是能否和平解决苏伊士运河问题的关键。确认埃及对苏伊士运河的主权，就能够解决争端；否认，或者仅仅在口头上而不是在实际上承认埃及主权，就不可能解决问题。过去两个多月来，苏伊士运河问题之所以悬而未决，根本原因就在于英、法、美三国企图侵犯埃及主权，夺取苏伊士运河，以达到它们的殖民主义的目的。事实已经证明，这条路是走不通的。现在英、法、美三国在联合国安全理事会的会议上同意了尊重埃及主权的这个原则，应该说是明智的。
    可是，英、法在提交安全理事会的提案中虽然同意了六项原则，同时却又坚持要安全理事会批准早就被埃及拒绝了的所谓“十八国建议”。这是它们在开始向前走了一步后，又企图回到原来的地方。英、法这种既承认了应该尊重埃及主权，而又想在具体作法上抹煞埃及主权的自相矛盾的行动，显然是要给根据这些原则和平解决苏伊士运河问题设置障碍。英、法的这种做法是非常愚蠢的。美国积极支持英、法提案的后一部分，表明它不愿意使目前中东紧张局势得到缓和。
    英、法、美三国的这种态度遭到了苏联和南斯拉夫代表的坚决反对，英、法提案中关于要求安全理事会承认“十八国建议”的部分被苏联否决，这就使得安全理事会终于对和平解决苏伊士运河问题作出了贡献。苏联和南斯拉夫这种维护联合国宪章原则、致力于在尊重埃及主权的基础上寻求和平解决的行动，反映了全世界爱好和平的人民的共同愿望。
    联合国安全理事会就协商解决苏伊士运河问题所通过的六项原则，是埃及人民在维护自己主权的斗争中所取得的一个重大胜利，也是各国人民为争取和平解决苏伊士运河问题而努力的结果。现在，安全理事会应当督促有关各方，特别是英、法、美三国，立即根据六项原则开始关于苏伊士运河问题的和平谈判。人们希望，英国和法国能够看清形势，放弃侵犯埃及主权的任何打算，老老实实地同埃及进行谈判。任何节外生枝、制造障碍的手段，都只能对它们自己更加不利。
