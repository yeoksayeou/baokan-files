Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 10th: The Shenyang Smelting Plant launched discussions among its management personnel to criticize non-cooperative phenomena in their work, resolving disputes between various units and improving work.

For a long time, there had been a lack of cooperation between departments, between workshops, and between departments and workshops in this plant. Sometimes, a very simple task would be pushed back and forth between the relevant units for a long time without resolution. This not only affected unity among them but also seriously affected the completion of the production plan. By July of this year, this "buck-passing" phenomenon had developed to a very serious extent. Workers in the Bessemer converter shop discovered that, due to the poor quality of the yellow clay, the copper tapping hole was eroding. If this continued, the Bessemer converter would likely experience a serious copper leakage accident. The workshop immediately requested the supply department to purchase good yellow clay. Purchasing a truckload of better yellow clay was a very simple matter, but the supply department refused because the Bessemer workshop had not submitted a plan to buy yellow clay the previous month. Later, the Bessemer furnace eventually experienced two consecutive copper leakage accidents due to the poor quality of the yellow clay. Three workers were burned on the spot, and Li Guichang, the head of the large furnace team, fainted during the rescue and more than 600 kilograms of molten copper was lost.

The leading cadres of this plant learned a lesson from this incident. The plant's Party Committee held a plenary meeting to discuss the problem of the weak Party spirit of some enterprise management cadres in economic activities and their lack of mutual cooperation. It was decided to launch free discussions among all management personnel to learn from the Bessemer furnace copper leakage incident, criticize the non-cooperative style, and resolve the long-standing disputes between various units.

After listening to the mobilization reports by the Party Committee Secretary and the Plant Director, the management personnel of various departments and workshops conducted self-criticisms in light of the copper leakage incident and also criticized other units. During the discussion, some units also raised different opinions on some unrealistic criticisms. For example, the Technical Supervision Section believed that the criticism from various units regarding the frequent omissions in their inspections was correct, but they also raised their own difficulties. They criticized the factory leadership for neglecting technical supervision work and the problem of the insufficient number of technical supervision personnel, which had not been resolved for a long time. After studying the opinions of this section, the factory leadership has agreed to provide them with technical personnel. In the past, the Technical Supervision Section, the Sales Section, the Planning Section, and the Transportation Section often "passed the buck" over product quality issues. During the discussion, the responsible persons of the above-mentioned units held a special symposium, which led to the preliminary unification of long-standing differences.

At present, after preliminary criticism of the non-cooperative style, a new atmosphere has emerged in the work of many departments in this plant. After the supply department staff clarified their concept of serving production, they have become more proactive in their work than before. Recently, the responsible persons of the Party, administrative, trade union, and Youth League organizations of this section have gone deep into the workshops to solicit opinions and understand the needs of the workshops. In August, the plant carried out four temporary construction projects, and the required raw materials were not planned. After the supply department staff took the initiative to contact various brother factories, the problem has been solved. At the same time, the supply department has also changed its organizational structure to strengthen cooperation among warehouse, supply, and procurement personnel to jointly serve production. The Technical Section and the Laboratory have also revised the original unrealistic technical operating procedures and proposed new technical operating procedure plans. When contacting work, all units have also strengthened the spirit of unity and cooperation to jointly serve production.

    开展自由讨论改进工作作风
    沈阳冶炼厂纠正不协作现象
    据新华社沈阳10日电　沈阳冶炼厂在管理人员中展开讨论，批判工作中的不协作现象，解决了各单位之间的争端，改进了工作。
    这个厂科室和科室之间、车间和车间之间、科室和车间之间长期存在着互相不协作的现象，有时因为一件很简单的工作，各有关单位互相推来推去，长期不得解决，不仅影响了互相之间的团结，也严重地影响了生产计划的完成。到今年7月，这种“扯皮”现象已经发展到很严重的程度。真吹炉工人发现由于黄土质量不好，出铜口有冲刷现象，如继续发展下去，真吹炉便有发生严重的跑铜事故的可能。车间立即请求供应科购买好黄土。购一车较好的黄土本是一项很简单的事情，但是因为真吹车间没有在上个月提出买黄土的计划，竟被供应科拒绝了。后来，真吹炉终因黄土质量不好连续发生了两次跑铜事故，三个工人当场被烫伤，大炉组长李贵昌在抢救中晕倒，并且损失了六百多公斤铜水。
    这个厂的领导干部从这一事件中吸取了教训，厂的中共党委会召开全体委员会议，讨论了某些企业管理干部在经济活动中党性薄弱，互相不协作的问题，决定在全厂管理人员中开展自由讨论，从真吹炉跑铜事件中吸取教训，批判不协作作风，解决各单位之间长期存在的争端。
    各科室、车间管理人员听了党委书记和厂长的动员报告，许多单位都结合跑铜事件进行了自我检查，并且对其他单位提出了批评。有些单位在讨论中对某些不切实的批评也提出了不同的意见。如技术监督科认为各单位对这个科经常漏检的批评是正确的，但是也提出了自己的困难，他们批评工厂领导方面忽视技术监督工作，技术监督科工作人员不足的问题长期没有得到解决。厂的领导方面研究了这个科的意见以后，已经同意给配备技术力量。过去技术监督科、销售科、计划科、运输科常因产品质量问题“扯皮”，在讨论中，上述单位负责人举行了专门性的座谈会，使长期存在的分歧得到初步统一。
    目前，这个厂经过初步批判不协作作风，许多部门的工作已经出现了新气象。供应科工作人员明确了为生产服务的观念以后，工作较以前主动了。最近，这个科的党、行政、工会、青年团组织的负责人都深入车间征求意见，了解车间需要。8月份，这个厂进行了四项临时修建工程，所需原材料都没有计划，经供应科工作人员主动和各兄弟工厂联系，已经得到解决。同时，供应科也改变了组织机构，使仓库、供应、采购人员加强合作，共同为生产服务。技术科、试验室也修改了原来不切合实际的技术操作规程，提出了新的技术操作规程方案。各单位在联系工作的时候，也都增强了团结合作共同为生产服务的精神。
