    This newspaper reports that, according to statistics from the People's Bank of China, the total balance of savings deposits nationwide reached 1,988,360,000 yuan in mid-September, an increase of 94,180,000 yuan in the first two weeks of September. This growth rate is unprecedented, surpassing the growth rate of savings deposits during the issuance of new currency last year. As of mid-September, seven provinces, cities, and autonomous regions had already exceeded their annual planned savings targets: Qinghai completed 178%, Inner Mongolia completed 121%, Guangxi completed 115%, Gansu completed 111%, Hunan completed 106%, and Shanghai completed 103%. Among the remaining twenty-one branches, eleven had completed more than 60% of their annual planned targets.

    The unprecedented increase in deposits is mainly due to the retroactive payment of wages to employees. According to reports from local People's Banks, after receiving their wages, some employees used them to improve their living standards, while others deposited them in the bank. Employees' lives have generally improved. Many people have bought new clothes. A factory store in Yanta District, Xi'an, received 130 new watches, which were sold out in a few days. Sun Yiying, an outstanding teacher at the Tianjin district level, not only renovated her old bedroom after receiving her retroactive wages, but also bought new pants and shoes for her mother-in-law, added a new set of clothes for each of her five children, made two new qipaos for herself, and saved the rest.

    The widespread establishment of new institutions by local People's Banks to facilitate deposits and withdrawals for the masses, the competition among bank staff to improve work efficiency, and the strengthening of services are also among the reasons for the surge in deposits.

    九月份全国存款额空前增长
    本报讯　据中国人民银行统计，全国九月中旬储蓄存款总余额已达十九亿八千八百三十六万元，其中九月上中两旬增加九千四百十八万元。这两旬的增长速度是空前的，超过了去年新币发行时储蓄存款的增长速度。9月中旬止，全国已经有七个省、市、自治区分行提前超额完成了全年计划储蓄任务：青海完成178％，内蒙古完成121％，广西完成115％，甘肃完成111％，湖南完成106％，上海完成103％。其余二十一个分行中，也有十一个行完成了全年计划任务的60％以上。
    存款空前增长的原因主要是职工补发工资。据各地人民银行反映，职工领到工资后，一部分用以改善自己的生活，一部分就存入了银行，职工生活普遍有所提高。很多人添置了衣物，西安雁塔区某工厂商店新到手表一百三十只，几天就销售一空。天津区级优秀教师孙以瑛领到补发工资后，除把陈旧的卧室粉刷一新外，她给婆婆买了新裤新鞋，给五个孩子各添置了一套新衣服，她自己也做了两件花旗袍，其余都存了储蓄。
    各地人民银行普遍增设机构，便利群众存取，银行工作人员开展竞赛，提高工作效率，加强服务也是存款激增的原因之一。
