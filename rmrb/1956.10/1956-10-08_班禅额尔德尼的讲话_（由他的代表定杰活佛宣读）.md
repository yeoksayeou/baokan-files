    The great and correct ethnic and religious policies of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao shine upon the entire country. At the same time, our thriving Tibetan region, where Buddhism flourishes, is also illuminated by this light. Thus, today in Lhasa, the inaugural meeting of the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association of China is gloriously and victoriously convened. Here, we wholeheartedly and enthusiastically celebrate and pay our highest respects.
    Since Tibet's peaceful liberation, the provisions of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet regarding freedom of religious belief and the protection of lamaseries have been faithfully implemented. Therefore, both the political and religious aspects of Tibet are flourishing, like a rising full moon. On this foundation, especially with the establishment this year of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, which includes the Religious Affairs Committee, this organization includes members from various religious sects, all of whom are actively working to promote their respective sects. Based on this burgeoning foundation, and in accordance with the aims and regulations of the Buddhist Association of China, the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association of China is now formally established. This fact definitively proves the Buddhists' love for Buddhism. This is not only something exciting for the Buddhists in our Tibetan region, but also a great achievement that brings boundless joy to Buddhists across the country. These achievements are inseparable from the correct ethnic policies of the great and wise Chairman Mao. Therefore, we should pay our highest respects to the Chinese Communist Party and the great Chairman Mao.
    To all those present: After the establishment of this association, we should, in accordance with ethnic policies, the policy of freedom of religious belief, and the essence of the Buddhist teachings of both exoteric and esoteric traditions, promote and expand the Buddhist scriptures that have been neglected. At the same time, male and female believers of all denominations should strengthen the unity within believers, the unity of the Tibetan people, and the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities, so that everyone can become closer. In accordance with the rules of each monastery, we should conscientiously observe the precepts, lecture on the scriptures, practice diligently according to the Dharma, and conduct ourselves purely and brightly in both understanding and behavior. At the same time, we must gradually raise the idea of anti-imperialism and patriotism, so that Buddhism will always flourish and spread. Furthermore, we must initiate the compassionate Bodhi mind, don the armor of energetic exchange of self and others, defend the permanent peace of the world, and support the construction of a socialist society of equality and happiness. In this way, the construction of our Tibetan political, religious, economic, cultural, health, transportation, and other undertakings will gradually flourish like the rising tide of the sea, and the people will surely become happier day by day. To this end, I hope that everyone will make deep efforts.
    Finally, I wish: The conference a victorious success, and that Buddhism will flourish and remain in the world forever!
    Long live world peace!
    Long live the Dalai Lama!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao!

    班禅额尔德尼的讲话
    （由他的代表定杰活佛宣读）
    中国共产党和毛主席的伟大正确的民族政策的宗教政策光辉照耀着全国的同时，我们佛法兴盛的西藏地方，也受到这个光辉的照耀，从而今天在拉萨光荣胜利的召开了成立中国佛教协会西藏分会的大会，在此，我们衷心热烈地庆祝，并致崇高的敬礼。
    西藏自从得到和平解放以后，忠实地执行了和平解放西藏办法的协议内的宗教信仰自由和保护喇嘛寺庙等的规定，所以西藏的政教两方面，都得到欣欣向荣，如月圆初升。在这个基础上面，尤其是今年成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会，其中并包括宗教事务委员会的组织，这个组织包括有各教派的委员，他们都正在为着发扬各教派而积极努力，就在这个方兴未艾的基础上，遵照中国佛教协会的宗旨和章程，现在正式成立了中国佛教协会西藏分会。这一事实，确切地证明了佛教徒们对佛教的爱护，这不仅是我们西藏地方佛教徒们值得兴奋的事情，同时也是全国的佛教徒们无限欢喜的一件胜举。这些成就，都是和伟大英明的毛主席的正确民族政策分不开的，所以我们应对中国共产党和伟大的毛主席致崇高的敬意。
    到会的各位：在本会成立之后，应根据民族政策，信教自由政策，佛教显密法海的要义，把佛教经义偏废了的发扬光大起来。同时，各教派的男女信徒们应加强信教者内部的团结，藏族人民的团结，汉藏民族的团结，使大家进一步亲密起来，并根据各寺庙的规矩，好好遵守戒律、讲学经论、如法修持躬体力行，在见解上和在行为上都要清净光明，同时把反帝爱国的思想逐步提高，以便佛教永远弥扬昌盛，更要发起慈悲菩提之心，披着自他互换的精进铠甲，保卫世界的永久和平，支持平等幸福的社会主义的建设。这样，我们西藏的政教、经济、文化、卫生、交通等各方面的建设事业就会如大海之高潮渐次兴盛起来，同时人民也必定会日益得到幸福。为此，希望各位都给予深切的努力。
    最后我祝愿：大会胜利成功，佛教兴隆永远住世！
    世界和平万岁！
    达赖喇嘛万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
