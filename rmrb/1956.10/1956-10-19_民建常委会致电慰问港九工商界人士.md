Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The Central Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association sent a telegram on the 17th to the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to express condolences to industrial and commercial figures in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The text of the telegram is as follows:

To the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, please forward to the industrial and commercial circles of Hong Kong and Kowloon:

News has come that the Taiwan Kuomintang secret agents, at the end of their rope and devoid of humanity, gathered over ten thousand hooligans and ruffians, and taking advantage of the opportunity of the October 10th Xinhai Revolution anniversary, openly created a large-scale, organized riot in Kowloon, carrying out rampant attacks and robberies against several factories, shops, banks, schools, and the general residents. Newspaper offices and news agencies were also seriously threatened, and even murder and arson occurred, causing incalculable losses to life and property, finally turning the Kowloon area into a world of terror. This unprecedented atrocity not only proves that the Taiwan Kuomintang group is insane and deliberately hostile to the people to the end, but also is a challenge to human civilization, which cannot but arouse great indignation among the people of the motherland.

The China Democratic National Construction Association is a democratic party composed mainly of national industrialists and businessmen. We are very concerned about the safety of life and property of our compatriots and industrial and commercial figures in Hong Kong and Kowloon. We hereby send a telegram to your association to express our heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the industrial and commercial figures in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and fully support their demand for the Hong Kong security authorities to arrest the perpetrators and quell the chaos.

Judging from the already exposed and well-known signs, this riot in Kowloon by Kuomintang secret agents was premeditated for a long time, and the Taiwan Kuomintang group should bear full responsibility for it. At the same time, the Kuomintang group's perverse actions further demonstrate its desperate struggle before its demise. The masterminds and chief culprits who created this Kowloon disturbance should be severely punished.

The Kowloon riot has continued for several days. The Hong Kong security authorities were negligent in prevention beforehand and have repeatedly condoned and tolerated it afterward. So far, they have not arrested the masterminds who planned the riot and quickly and effectively stopped it. Instead, they have falsely accused the Kuomintang secret agents' inhuman atrocities as a "conflict between two factions of Chinese," a "plan by local secret societies," and a "Communist Party vs. Kuomintang event." This is obviously to shirk responsibility for the rioters and is a slander against the Chinese people. The Chinese people cannot tolerate such absurd and shameful propaganda. Regarding the failure of the Hong Kong authorities to stop the riot organized by Kuomintang secret agents, Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council has lodged a serious protest, demanding severe sanctions against Kuomintang secret agents and effective protection of Chinese residents and Chinese government-affiliated agencies and enterprises in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and demanding a response from the British government. We fully support this solemn expression representing the Chinese people.

    民建常委会致电慰问港九工商界人士
    新华社18日讯　中国民主建国会中央常务委员会17日致电香港中华总商会慰问港九工商界人士。电文如下：
    香港中华总商会请转港九工商界：
    消息传来，穷途末路、绝灭人性的台湾国民党特务分子纠集了流氓、无赖共万余人，利用10月10日辛亥革命纪念日的机会，在九龙公然制造大规模有组织的暴乱，对若干工厂、商店、银行、学校和广大居民进行猖狂的袭击和抢劫，报馆和通讯社亦受到严重威胁，甚至杀人纵火，造成生命财产无可计算的损失，终于使九龙地区一变而为恐怖世界。这个空前的暴行，不仅证明台湾国民党集团丧心病狂，蓄意与人民为敌到底，而且是对于人类文明的挑战，不能不引起祖国人民的极大愤慨。
    中国民主建国会是以民族工商业者为主要组成分子的民主党派，我们对于港九同胞和工商界人士的生命和财产安全非常关切，特电贵会请代向港九工商界人士致衷心的同情和慰问，并且对于他们对香港治安当局缉凶平乱的要求全力支持。
    从已经暴露、尽人皆知的迹象看，这次国民党特务分子在九龙的暴行是蓄谋已久的，台湾国民党集团对此应负完全责任。同时，国民党集团这样倒行逆施，更表示它在垂死前的疯狂挣扎。制造这次九龙骚乱的祸首和主凶应该受到严厉的惩处。
    九龙暴行连续发生了几天，香港治安当局事前既疏于防范，事后又一再姑息和纵容。至今还未拿缉策划暴行的祸首，迅速地、有效地加以制止，反而含血喷人，把国民党特务分子绝灭人性的暴行说成是“两派华人的冲突”，说成是“当地秘密会社的计划”，说成是“共产党对国民党的事件”，显然是替暴徒推卸责任，是对中国人民的诬蔑。中国人民不能容忍这种荒谬可耻的宣传。对于香港当局未能制止国民党特务所组织的暴乱，国务院周恩来总理已经提出严重抗议，要求严厉制裁国民党特务分子，切实保护在港九的中国居民和中国政府所属机关和企业，并且要求英国政府给予答复。我们完全支持这个代表中国人民的严正表示。
  中国民主建国会中央常务委员会
