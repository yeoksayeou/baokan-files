Respected President Sukarno, esteemed guests from Indonesia, comrades, friends:

Today, the people of Shanghai are extremely excited and honored to welcome the great warrior against colonialism, the great leader of the Republic of Indonesia, President Sukarno, and the Indonesian guests to Shanghai. On behalf of the six million people of Shanghai, I extend a warm welcome and heartfelt respect to President Sukarno and the Indonesian guests.

These past few days, the people of Shanghai have been eagerly awaiting information about your visit to our city. They have read and heard the important and moving speeches delivered by President Sukarno in our capital, Beijing, through newspapers and radio broadcasts. These speeches resonated with the people of Shanghai, closely linking our ideals with those of the Indonesian people. These are: the ideal of independence, the ideal of peace, the ideal of a new world. Now, respected President, you are about to deliver a speech to the people of Shanghai in person, and the excitement of the people of Shanghai is beyond words. Your speech and your visit to Shanghai will further consolidate and develop the historical friendship between the people of our country and the people of Indonesia. On behalf of the people of Shanghai, I express my heartfelt thanks to you!

The name of President Sukarno is familiar to the people of Shanghai; the name of Sukarno is linked to the struggle against colonialism. Here, I would like to emphasize that Shanghai is also a city with revolutionary traditions in the struggle against colonialism and imperialism. The heroes of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom fought bloody battles with the imperialists in the streets of Shanghai. The great Chinese revolutionary, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, led the people's struggle in Shanghai. The great Chinese Communist Party was founded in Shanghai. The working class of Shanghai has held three armed uprisings in the struggle against all lackeys and traitors of imperialism, carrying out a heroic struggle, until 1949, when the workers and people of Shanghai, in coordination with the Chinese People's Liberation Army, finally liberated Shanghai. Today, President Sukarno, the famous great warrior against colonialism, has also come to our city, which adds to the glory of our city. Today, the people are the masters of Shanghai. We welcome you with the new face of Shanghai, which will surely bring you the greatest joy, and we are willing to share this greatest joy with you!

Dear friends, comrades: Indonesia has the sixth largest population in the world, with more than ten thousand islands and more than five thousand kilometers of national border. This great maritime nation is the hub connecting the Pacific and Indian Oceans and a vital passage for Asia and Africa, with an extremely important strategic position. Therefore, from the day Indonesia gained its independence, it has been a major country in Asia and the world. Like our China, it should build its country according to its own national characteristics and the way of life that it likes; it should become a strong country in Asia and the world!

Friends, comrades: The person who is about to deliver a speech to you is President Sukarno, who is the leader of Indonesia. We should express a warm welcome and infinite admiration to such a great warrior against colonialism and such a leader who is loyal to the cause of national independence!

Now we invite the respected President Sukarno to speak.

专栏：

    陈毅市长的讲话敬爱的苏加诺总统阁下，敬爱的印度尼西亚的贵宾们，同志们，朋友们：
    今天上海人民能够在上海欢迎英勇的反殖民主义的伟大战士，印度尼西亚共和国的伟大领袖苏加诺总统阁下和印度尼西亚的贵宾们，感到十分的兴奋和光荣。我谨代表上海六百万人民向苏加诺总统阁下和印度尼西亚的贵宾们，表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意。
    这几天，上海人民一直在探听着你们到我们上海访问的信息。他们从报纸上和广播中，读到了和听到了总统阁下在我国首都北京发表的那些重要的、动人的演说。这些演说引起了上海人民的共鸣，它把我们的理想同印度尼西亚人民的理想紧密地联系起来了。这就是：独立的理想，和平的理想，新世界的理想。现在，敬爱的总统阁下你就要亲自对上海人民发表演说了，上海人民的兴奋的心情是用语言难以表达的。你的演说和你来到上海访问，必将进一步巩固和发展我国人民和印度尼西亚人民之间的历史友谊。我谨代表上海人民向你表示衷心的感谢！
    苏加诺总统的名字，上海人民是熟悉的；苏加诺的名字是同反殖民主义的斗争联系在一起的。在这里我愿意着重地指出：在反对殖民主义，在反对帝国主义的斗争中，上海也是一个有革命传统的城市。太平天国的英雄们曾在上海街头同帝国主义者作过浴血苦斗，中国人民的伟大革命家孙中山先生曾在上海领导过人民的斗争，伟大的中国共产党是在上海成立的。上海的工人阶级曾经在反对帝国主义一切走狗和卖国贼的斗争中，举行过三次武装起义，进行了英勇的斗争，直到1949年，上海的工人和人民配合中国人民解放军最后解放了上海。今天，总统阁下，著名的反殖民主义的伟大战士也来到了我们的城市，更增加了我们这个城市的光荣。今天，人民已是上海的主人。我们以新上海的面貌欢迎你，当能引起你最大的欢乐，我们愿意与你一起共同享受这个最大的欢乐！
    亲爱的朋友们，同志们：印度尼西亚的人口占世界第六位，有一万多个海岛，有五千多公里的国境线。这一个伟大的海洋国家，是连系太平洋和印度洋的枢纽，是亚非交通的要道，战略地位极为重要，因此，印度尼西亚从她获得独立的一天起，她就是一个亚洲和世界的大国，她和我们中国一样，按照自己的民族特点和她们自己所喜爱的生活方式来建设自己的国家；应该成为亚洲和世界的强国！
    朋友们，同志们：将要向你们发表演说的就是苏加诺总统，他就是印度尼西亚的领导人，像这样一位反殖民主义的伟大战士、像这样一位忠实于民族独立事业的领导人，我们应该表示热烈的欢迎和无限的崇敬！
    现在我们请敬爱的苏加诺总统讲话。
