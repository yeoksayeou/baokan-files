Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 28th. The Vietnamese newspaper "People's Daily" published an article on October 26th stating that the economic situation in South Vietnam is deteriorating daily.

The article pointed out that the most serious difficulty in South Vietnam's economy is the massive trade deficit. In the first seven months of this year, the value of goods imported by South Vietnam was 4,315 million South Vietnamese Dong, while the value of exported goods was only 771 million South Vietnamese Dong, only 18% of imports.

The main reason for the sharp decline in South Vietnam's exports is the decline in rice production. Southern Vietnam has more than 2,303,000 hectares of fertile land, which used to produce an average of 3 million tons of rice per year. In addition to meeting domestic needs, it could also export about 1.5 million tons. In 1939, the year with the best harvest, South Vietnam exported 1.62 million tons of rice, earning 1,338 million francs, nearly half of the total export value of 2,904 million francs that year. In the two years since the restoration of peace, South Vietnam has continued to experience war, fields have been abandoned, crops have failed, and there is not enough rice to eat, so it can no longer be exported.

The article also talked about the bad consequences caused by the United States' use of "aid" to control South Vietnam's import and export trade. For example, South Vietnam purchased 80,000 tons of coal from the United States at a price of 30 US dollars per ton and 210,000 tons of cement at a price of 26 US dollars per ton. However, at that time, the price of coal in North Vietnam was 17 US dollars per ton, and cement was 13 US dollars per ton. Even with the shipping cost from Haiphong to Saigon, it would be about one-third cheaper than American goods. Based on these two transactions alone, Ngo Dinh Diem caused the people to lose 2.9 million US dollars.

### 田园荒芜　美货充斥  南越经济情况每况愈下

    田园荒芜　美货充斥
    南越经济情况每况愈下
    新华社河内28日电　越南“人民报”10月26日刊登一篇文章说，目前，南越的经济情况日益恶化。
    文章指出，南越经济中最严重的困难是大量入超问题。在今年的头七个月当中，南越进口货价值为四十三亿一千五百万元南越币，而出口货价值仅有七亿七千一百万元南越币，只有进口的18％。
    南越出口锐减的主要原因是由于稻米生产下降。越南南部有二百三十万三千多公顷的肥沃土地，从前平均每年可产大米三百万吨。除了供应国内的需要外，还能够出口一百五十万吨左右。收成最好的1939年越南南部出口了一百六十二万吨大米，收入十三亿三千八百万法郎，将近这一年出口总额二十九亿零四百万法郎的一半。和平恢复两年来，南越继续有战争，田地荒芜，庄稼失收，大米不够吃，再也不能出口。
    这篇文章还谈到美国利用“援助”控制南越进出口贸易所造成的恶果。例如，南越曾向美国以三十美元一吨的价格购买了八万吨的煤和以二十六美元一吨的价格购买了二十一万吨水泥。但是，当时北越的煤价是十七美元一吨，水泥是十三美元一吨。加上了从海防到西贡的运费，也要比美国货便宜三分之一左右。仅以这两笔交易计算，吴庭艳就使人民损失二百九十万美元。
