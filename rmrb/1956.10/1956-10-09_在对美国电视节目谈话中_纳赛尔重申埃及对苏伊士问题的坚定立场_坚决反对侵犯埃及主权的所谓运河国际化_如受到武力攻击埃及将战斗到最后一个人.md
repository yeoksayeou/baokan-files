Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 8th: President Nasser reiterated Egypt's firm stance on the Suez Canal issue in an interview on the US Columbia Broadcasting System television program on October 7.

Answering the question of why Egypt has rejected all the proposals made by Western countries so far, Nasser said that the internationalization of the Suez Canal is an act of aggression against Egypt that infringes upon our dignity and sovereignty. We consider this an act of infringement on Egyptian sovereignty, and we consider this a new form of rule, because for us it means seizing the canal, taking over the canal from the Egyptian people, and having it managed by others. That is the so-called international committee, the Suez Canal Committee. Will this end the dispute, or is this the beginning of the dispute? We have just removed the symbol of hatred and colonialism—that is, the British occupation. At the same time, we are striving to complete Egypt's complete independence. Are we willing to have another symbol of occupation or rule? The Suez Canal Management Committee, because it is an international management committee, will be such a symbol. Now we look around us and realize that a group of countries is going to rule the Suez Canal. For us, this is collective colonialism—collective rule.

Nasser continued, we have been studying the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company for more than two years. We have been able to obtain materials showing that the Suez Canal Company is trying to extend the concession. We also received news that some countries are trying to internationalize the management of the Suez Canal. Therefore, we strive to maintain our rights, because we once granted the Suez Canal concession, and assumed that this concession would end after ninety-nine years. After that, the Egyptian government will take over the management of the canal. In the past few years, we have been studying this point and studying the issue between the government and the canal. We realized that the Suez Canal Company is a state within a state, so we decided that this concession must end and must not be extended. We did not set a date, but just wanted this to happen within a year or two or three. But after the loans and aid for the Aswan High Dam were withdrawn, we felt we had to nationalize the Suez Canal Company. They usually allocate 16 million pounds a year, and we believe the Egyptian people can use this 16 million pounds to develop their construction projects.

Nasser then answered the question: "Was there a time during this crisis when you thought Britain and France might really use force?" He said, of course, because there were threats—threats of the use of force, the concentration and deployment of troops, I think at any time I could face aggression. I still think so now. He also said that Egypt will rely on itself in the event of the use of force. "As long as we are attacked—we don't attack anyone, we will have to protect ourselves, down to the last bullet and the last man."

Nasser refuted the slander that Egypt might one day block the Suez Canal to Britain and France. He said, I think it's easy to know this won't happen. No, I think it's a matter of reputation. I think they are convinced that we will not block the canal or raise navigation taxes, because if we block the canal, we will be in trouble.

Referring to the US withdrawal of its proposal to finance the Aswan Dam, Nasser said that the US State Department's statement withdrawing this assistance surprised us. It is said that the reason is that our economy cannot indeed repay this loan. I think this is an action against us, to make us beg for mercy. I think we would rather hear a kind word than this 70 million dollars. I think if the US government said to us: we are not prepared to give assistance or are not prepared to give you aid—or are not prepared to give you loans, we would answer: thank you. But if a statement is issued saying: we are not prepared to lend to Egypt because their economic situation is such and such, we consider this a real action against the Egyptian people and the Egyptian government. I said, we will not say—we will not beg for mercy. We will not listen to anyone to dictate.

The Columbia Broadcasting Corporation reporter further asked, "If a solution—an acceptable solution to the Suez Canal issue—is found, would you still hope to get economic and financial assistance from the United States?"

Nasser replied that he did not think that we would ask about assistance after such a thing had happened. After our self-esteem has been hurt by the statements that have been published, we will not ask at all.

Nasser also said that he did think that the United States was afraid of Egyptian industrialization.

Referring to Egypt's strength, Nasser said, "We are strong, we must strengthen our strength, and we must understand our strength."

The reporter also asked, if Britain and France impose greater economic sanctions in the Suez Canal crisis, wouldn't you be increasingly forced towards the Soviet Union?

Nasser said that we have no choice. Either we don't sell our cotton and keep it here; or we have to sell it to the Soviet Union. I think it would be more beneficial for us to sell it to the Soviet Union. We will be deeply grateful.

　　在对美国电视节目谈话中
　　纳赛尔重申埃及对苏伊士问题的坚定立场
    坚决反对侵犯埃及主权的所谓运河国际化
    如受到武力攻击埃及将战斗到最后一个人
    据新华社8日讯　开罗消息：纳赛尔总统10月7日在美国哥伦比亚广播公司电视节目的谈话中重申了埃及对苏伊士运河问题的坚定立场。
    纳赛尔在答复埃及为什么拒绝了到目前为止西方国家所提出的所有的建议这个问题时说，苏伊士运河的国际化对于埃及来说是一个侵犯我们的尊严和主权的侵略行动。我们认为这是侵犯埃及主权的行动，我们认为这是一种新的统治形式，因为这对我们来说是意味着攫取运河，是从埃及人民手里接管运河，由另外一些人去加以管理。这就是所谓国际委员会，苏伊士运河委员会。这是否会终止这个纠纷，或者这还是纠纷的开始？我们刚刚去除了仇恨和殖民主义的象征——那就是英国的占领。同时我们正在努力完成埃及的完全独立。我们难道愿意有另一个占领或统治的象征吗？苏伊士运河管理委员会因为是国际化的管理委员会，它将是这样的一个象征。现在我们看看我们周围，并且认识到有一群国家是要来统治苏伊士运河的。对我们来说这就是集体殖民主义——集体的统治。
    纳赛尔接着说，我们研究苏伊士运河公司国有化问题已经两年多了，我们曾经能够得到材料表明苏伊士运河公司正企图延长让与权，我们还得到消息说，有些国家企图使苏伊士运河管理国际化，因此我们努力保持住我们的权利，因为我们曾经给予苏伊士运河的让与权，并且假定这项让与权在九十九年后就将结束。在这以后，埃及政府就将接收这条运河的管理权。在过去几年中，我们
  一直在研究这一点和研究政府和运河之间的问题，我们认识到，苏伊士运河公司是国家中的一个国家，因此我们决定这项让与权必须结束并且决不能加以延长。我们的确并没有确定日期，而只是想这件事件在一年或两年或三年之内实现。但是在关于阿斯旺高水坝的贷款和援助被撤回以后，我们认为我们必须把苏伊士运河公司收归国有。他们通常每年分配一千六百万镑，我们认为埃及人民可以使用这一千六百万镑来发展他们的建设工程。
    纳赛尔随着回答了这个问题：“在这次危机当中是不是一个时候你认为英法可能真的使用武力？”他说，当然，因为有威胁——使用武力的威胁，军队的集中和调动，我认为任何时候我都有面临侵略行动的可能。直到现在我仍然这样想。他又说，在发生使用武力的事情埃及将依靠自己。“只要我们受到攻击——我们不进攻任何人，我们就不得不保护我们自己，直到最后一粒子弹和最后一个人。”
    纳赛尔驳斥了硬说埃及有一天可能向英法封锁苏伊士运河的谰言。他说，我认为，这很容易知道这是不会发生的。不，我认为这是一件有关声誉的问题。我想他们确信我们不会封锁这条运河，或者提高航行税，因为如果我们封锁这条运河我们将遭到麻烦。
    在谈到美国撤销资助阿斯旺水坝的建议的时候，纳赛尔说，美国国务院撤销这种帮助的声明使我们大吃一惊。据说原因是我们的经济的确不能够偿付这笔贷款。我认为，这是一个反对我们，要我们讨饶的行动。我觉得我们宁可听到一句好话而不要这七千万美元。我认为假如美国政府对我们说：我们不准备给予资助或者不准备给你们援助——或者不准备给你们贷款，我们会回答：谢谢你们。但是假如发表一个声明说：我们不准备贷款给埃及因为他们的经济情况是如此如此，我们认为这是真正反对埃及人民和埃及政府的行动。我说过，我们不会说——我们不会讨饶的。我们不会听人来支配。
    哥伦比亚广播公司的记者进一步问道，“假如一个解决办法——一个可被接受的苏伊士运河问题的解决办法找到的话，你会不会仍然希望从美国得到经济和财政援助呢？”
    纳赛尔回答说，我认为在发生了这样的事以后我们是不会问起关于援助的事的。在被发表的声明伤了我们的自尊心后，我们是根本不会要求的。
    纳赛尔并且说，他的确认为美国害怕埃及工业化。
    纳赛尔在谈到埃及的力量的时候说，“我们是强大的，我们必须加强我们的力量，而且，我们必须了解我们的力量。”
    记者又问，假如在苏伊士运河危机中英国和法国实行更大的经济制裁的话，你会愈来愈被逼向苏联去，这难道不是真的吗？
    纳赛尔说，我们无可选择。我们要末不把我们的棉花卖出去而存在这里；要末我们就得把它卖给苏联。我想把它卖给苏联会对我们更有利。我们会深感其恩的。
