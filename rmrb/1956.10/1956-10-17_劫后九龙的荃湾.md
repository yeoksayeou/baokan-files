Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th: Hong Kong news: Reporters from Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao" and "Wen Wei Po" entered Tsuen Wan at 2:30 PM yesterday to conduct on-the-spot interviews about the riot situation. Previously, Hong Kong newspaper reporters had been allowed to enter the Tsuen Wan area for interviews, but these two newspapers, after repeated negotiations, were only granted permission yesterday.

The reporters from these two newspapers said upon their return that as soon as they entered the Tsuen Wan urban area, they felt the entire area was still shrouded in an atmosphere of terror. Tsuen Wan was still under curfew at the time. The streets were desolate after the looting, and many places were stained with discolored bloodstains and blood clots. The smell of blood mixed with the smell of burning was pungent. One or two stray dogs were sniffing at the bloodstains along the street.

The Silk Weavers' Union in the central area of Tsuen Wan was ruined and tattered. There were many broken glass shards and torn women's clothing scattered on the ground. A resident nearby whispered to the reporter that on the night of the incident on the 11th, he saw rioters throwing workers from the union off the roof. About twenty workers were driven to the street, stripped naked, and severely beaten before being kidnapped by the rioters.

The reporters then went to the Workers' Service Department of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile Dyeing Workers' General Union and the Tsuen Wan Workers' Clinic, affiliated with the Federation of Trade Unions, about two hundred yards away from Tsuen Wan Main Street in Muk Min Ha Village. These places were even more ravaged. The doors and windows of the service department and the wooden walls were all burned down. The area in front of the clinic was piled with the embers of the fire, and medical equipment, diagnostic instruments, and furniture were all smashed and burned. There were also bloodstains next to the service department and the clinic. These two locations were stormed and set on fire by rioters around 8 PM on the 11th. According to a shop clerk who refused to give his name, when the clinic was attacked and set on fire by rioters, two female workers and four male workers tried to escape, but they were surrounded and severely beaten by the rioters. One female worker was brutally beaten unconscious, and the rioters stripped her clothes and inserted a long iron bar into her vagina. It was a horrific sight. The Workers' Service Department (cooperative) was stormed by rioters, and more than ten employees were kidnapped. Led by a rioter carrying a Kuomintang flag, the kidnapped people were beaten as they walked. These employees have since disappeared.

The two reporters returned to the Tsuen Wan urban area at around 5 PM yesterday. Near the Red Lotus Bakery, they found torn men's and women's clothing and large piles of dark bloodstains. The gutters along the road were also filled with rubble, rags, and chunks of black blood clots. Under the corner of the signboard of the Datong Leather Shoe Company, someone had written the three words "Yang Foyang" crookedly with fresh blood. According to a shop clerk in a nearby store, many workers were detained and concentrated in this area during the riots that night. The rioters used stones to encircle them and beat them with iron bars. They screamed in agony, and many people were beaten to death. The shop clerk said that the words written in blood under the signboard might have been written by the victim before his death.

An employee of the Tsuen Wan Oriental Soy Sauce Factory told the reporters that the factory received a threatening phone call at 9 PM on the 11th, forcing them to hang Kuomintang flags. After 10 PM, more than a hundred rioters with white cloth strips tied around their arms, holding iron rulers, iron bars, watermelon knives, and other weapons, swarmed in. They first attacked with stones, then rushed into the factory and rampaged, setting fires everywhere. Some employees also said that when the rioters were committing the crimes, a black car was parked in front of the gate, and a Kuomintang secret agent in a suit was issuing orders. The factory caught fire and burned for a long time before the fire truck arrived, but it was blocked by the rioters and not allowed to put out the fire. When the rioters stormed in, the factory employees ran out from the back door and fled into the mountains.

The reporters from these two newspapers interviewed the Po Sing, Kowloon, and Nam Hoi textile factories separately. The windows of the Po Sing Textile Factory were completely broken by rioters with stones, and the remains of two overturned and burned cars were still placed in front of the factory. The cotton piles outside the factory still emitted a burnt odor and puffs of smoke, and some workers were continuing to extinguish them with water. According to an employee of the Po Sing Textile Factory, the rioters first besieged the factory with stones on the afternoon of the 11th, then climbed over the walls and rushed into the factory, chasing and beating employees everywhere, and setting fires. The washing and cleaning rooms were destroyed by fire, resulting in significant losses, and the machines were severely damaged. The factory urgently called for help when the incident occurred. When the police car arrived, it was attacked by the rioters, so the police withdrew. The rioters then became even more lawless, rampaging until about 9 PM before leaving with a howl. Before leaving, the rioters also kidnapped more than forty workers, who are still missing.

The Kowloon Textile Factory was stormed by rioters who threw stones and broke windows at 2 AM on the 12th. It is said that Kuomintang secret agents and rioters pressured the factory to negotiate, demanding that the factory agree to hang five Kuomintang flags and other harsh conditions before they would withdraw. The reporters also saw three overturned cars in front of the factory, two of which had been burned.

The reporters arrived at the Nam Hoi Textile Factory. This textile factory had issued an alarm on the night of the 14th that it was surrounded and attacked by rioters. A Mr. Zhang, the personnel director of the textile factory, said that when the British military police were searching for people in Tsuen Wan, they detained more than five hundred suspects and people related to the riots in this factory. He said that the British military police arrived at a little after 7 AM on the 14th and took the more than four hundred workers living in the factory to the square outside to identify them, while the staff were taken back to the police station for questioning. At 3 PM in the afternoon, only two hundred and twenty-seven people returned to the factory, and some others may have been arrested. This employee dared not reveal more information.

Tsuen Wan was still under curfew on the afternoon of the 15th, and news from the outside was cut off. The streets were deserted and desolate like a ruin, and people were filled with panic, terror, and anger hidden in their hearts. However, many residents dared not reveal the details of the Kuomintang secret agents' riots in Tsuen Wan to the reporters, fearing that once the truth was exposed, they would incur trouble, or even face death.

    劫后九龙的荃湾
    新华社广州16日电　香港消息：香港“大公报”和“文汇报”的记者在昨天下午二时三十分进入荃湾，实地采访骚乱情况。在此以前，香港的报纸记者已获准进入荃湾地区采访，但这两家报纸记者经一再交涉，在昨天才获准去那里。
    这两家报纸记者回来说，他们一进入荃湾市区，就感到整个地区仍然笼罩着恐怖气氛。当时荃湾还在戒严。大街上一片劫后的荒凉，许多地方都见到变了色的血渍和血块，血腥味混着焦臭味扑鼻。一二野犬在沿街舐嗅着血迹。
    住在荃湾中心区的丝织工会被毁坏得破烂不堪，地面上还有许多玻璃碎屑和被撕破了的女人衣裤。附近的一个居民小声地告诉记者，他在11日出事当晚，看见暴徒把工会的工人从天台上掷下来，另有二十名左右的工人被驱到街头剥光衣服后加以毒打，后来又被暴徒掳走了。
    记者们转到距荃湾大街约两百码远的木棉厦村港九纺织染业职工总会工人服务部和工联会属下的荃湾工人医疗所。这些地方更是满目疮痍。服务部的门窗和用木板作的墙壁全被烧毁，医疗所门前堆满火烧的余烬，医疗设备、诊病仪器和家具全被打碎和烧毁。服务部和医疗所门旁还有血渍。这两处都是在11日晚八时左右被暴徒攻入和放火的地点。据一家店铺不肯透露姓名的店员说，当医疗所被暴徒纵火攻破时，有两个女工和四个男职工逃命，被暴徒包围毒打，一个女工惨遭毒打后昏倒，暴徒还把这位女工的衫裤剥光，用一只长的铁条插入她的阴部，惨不忍睹。工人服务部（合作社）被暴徒攻破，有十多个职工被掳走。由一个扛着国民党旗帜的暴徒先行引路，被掳的人一边走一边挨打，这些职工最后失踪了。
    这两位记者在昨天下午五时许转回荃湾市区，在红莲面包商店附近一带，发现有撕破的男女衣服和大堆的淤黑的血迹，路旁沟渠还塞满瓦砾、破布和一块块的黑色血块。在大同皮鞋公司招牌角下，发现曾有人用鲜血写上了斜斜歪歪的“杨佛养”三个字。据附近一家商店的店员告诉记者，当天晚上骚乱时，有许多工人被暴徒拘押集中在这一带，暴徒用石块箍他们，用铁棍打他们，他们辗转惨叫，有许多人被活活打死。这个店员说，这块招牌下血写的字可能是受害者在临死前写下的。
    荃湾东方酱油厂的职员告诉记者，这家厂在11日晚上九时接到恐吓电话，强迫悬挂国民党旗帜。十时过后，就有一百多个手臂缠着白布条标志的暴徒手持铁尺、铁棍、西瓜刀和其他武器蜂涌而来。他们先用石块攻击，接着冲入厂房大肆捣乱，到处放火焚烧。有些职员还说，暴徒在行凶时，门前停放着一部黑色的小汽车，有一个穿西装的国民党特务分子在发号施令。厂房起火燃烧了许久，救火车才开到，但被暴徒拦阻，不准抢救。该厂的职工在暴徒冲入时，从后门跑出向山区逃避。
    这两家报纸的记者曾分别访问了宝星、九龙和南海等纱厂。宝星纱厂的窗门被暴徒用石块打得无一完整，厂房门前还摆着二辆被推翻焚毁的汽车残骸。在厂房外的棉花堆里，还发出烧焦的臭味和阵阵浓烟，有些工人在用水继续把它淋熄。据宝星纱厂一个职员说，暴徒们11日下午先用石块围攻，接着爬过围墙冲入厂内，到处追逐职工殴打，放火焚烧。洗纱间和清纱间被火烧毁，损失重大，机器损坏不堪。厂方在事发时曾紧急告警求救。当警车开来时，警车被暴徒拦击，于是警察就撤走了。暴徒这时更为所欲为，一直捣乱到九时左右才呼啸离去。暴徒在临走时，还把四十多个工人掳去，至今仍无踪迹。
    九龙纱厂是在12日凌晨二时被暴徒掷石毁坏窗门冲入的。据说，国民党特务分子和暴徒曾压迫厂方谈判，要厂方答应悬挂五只国民党旗帜和其他苛刻条件后方肯撤走。记者还在这家工厂门前看见有三部被推倒的汽车，其中两部已被烧毁。
    记者到达了南海纱厂。这家纱厂在14日夜间曾传出被暴徒包围攻击的警报。纱厂里一个姓张的人事科主任说，英方军警在荃湾搜捕时，曾把逮捕来的五百多个嫌疑和暴乱有关的人物，扣押在这家厂里。他说，在14日早晨七点多钟英方军警开到，把住厂的四百多名工人带到广场外辨认，职员则被带回警署询问。下午三时，只有二百二十七人回厂，其他可能有些被捕。这个职员不敢透露更多的事情。
    荃湾在15日下午仍处在戒严状态中，外间的消息被隔断。街道冷落荒凉得像一个废墟，人们都充满惊慌、恐怖和内心蕴藏着愤怒的情绪。但是，许多居民不敢对记者透露国民党特务在荃湾骚乱的详细情况，他们害怕一经揭露真情实况，自己会招致麻烦，甚至会有杀身之祸。
