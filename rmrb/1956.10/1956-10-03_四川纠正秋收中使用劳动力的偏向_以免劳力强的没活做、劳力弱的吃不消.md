    Sichuan Corrects the Tendency of Misusing Labor in Autumn Harvest
    So as to Prevent Strong Laborers from Having Nothing to Do and Weak Laborers from Being Overwhelmed
    (Our Newspaper News) Some agricultural cooperatives in Sichuan Province have developed a bias in the autumn harvest by restricting the work of strong and skilled members.
    After calculating the annual income distribution, some areas in the province, such as Da County and Jingyan, found that some members with weak labor and poor skills could not increase their income, and might even reduce it. Therefore, in the autumn harvest, they restricted the work of strong laborers and members who had earned many work points in the past, and allowed weak laborers and members who had earned fewer work points to work more. In Zhitong Township No. 14 Agricultural Cooperative in Da County, member Lei Yingguang was a strong laborer who had earned many work points in the past. This time, when threshing, he went to the field to work three times, but was driven back by the cooperative cadres, and was criticized for being "selfish." In Erli Township, Hejiang County, an average of three or four strong laborers were forced to stop working every day in two agricultural cooperatives. When the Shengli Agricultural Cooperative in Hejiang County harvested early rice, a rice thresher could thresh 14 to 16 loads of rice a day, but now it can only thresh 10 to 12 loads of rice a day. Due to improper labor allocation, the Jiefang Cooperative failed to harvest in time, and a gust of wind caused a loss of 40 *shi* of grain. Some agricultural cooperatives only assigned weak and unskilled members to thresh, and the phenomenon of scattering and wasting rice was also very serious. And some weak laborers also felt that the threshing work was too tight and overwhelming.
    After discovering the above-mentioned bias, Party organizations in various places have paid attention to correcting it. They are now deploying strong and skilled laborers to carry out the rush harvest with all their strength. In order to increase the income of those weak laborers, it has been decided to let them do more lighter work such as dragging rice straw, drying grain, picking cotton, and picking mung beans. In this way, both making the best use of people's talents and doing a good job in the autumn harvest, the members are very satisfied.

### 四川纠正秋收中使用劳动力的偏向  以免劳力强的没活做、劳力弱的吃不消

    四川纠正秋收中使用劳动力的偏向
    以免劳力强的没活做、劳力弱的吃不消
    本报讯　四川省部分农业社秋收中发生了限制劳动力强、技术较好的社员出工的偏向。
    这个省的达县、井研等地在试算全年收益分配以后，发现有一部分劳动力弱、技术较差的社员不能增加收入、甚至可能减少收入，于是在秋收中就限制劳动力强、过去工分做得多的社员出工，让劳动力弱、工分做得少的社员多出工。达县梓桐乡第十四农业社社员雷应光劳动力强，过去工分做得较多，这次打谷时，他三次到田里去干活，都被社干部撵了回来，还被批评为“自私自利”。合江县二里乡有两个农业社每天平均有三、四个劳动力强的社员被迫停工。合江县胜利农业社收早稻时，一架拌桶一天能打十四挑田到十六挑田的谷子，现在一天却只能打十挑田到十二挑田的谷子。解放社由于调工不当，收割不及时，一阵大风就损失了四十石谷子。有些农业社由于只调劳动力弱、技术差的社员打谷，抛撒、浪费稻谷的现象也很严重。而有些劳动力弱的社员也感到打谷活路太紧张，吃不消。
    各地党组织在发现上述偏向后，已注意纠正。现正调配劳动力强、技术好的社员全力进行抢收；为了使那些劳动力弱的社员增加收入，决定让他们多作一些拖谷草、晒谷子、捡棉花、摘绿豆等较轻活。这样，既做到了人尽其材，也搞好了秋收，社员们都很满意。
