    Reading "Sukarno's Speech Collection"
    Cui Qi

    The speech collection of Sukarno, President of the Republic of Indonesia, has met with our broad readership. We warmly welcome it and read it with great interest.

    The speech collection includes seventeen important speeches and documents delivered by Sukarno from 1945 to 1956, as well as a lengthy defense statement made in 1930 at the Bandung Dutch East Indies Colonial Court. As an Indonesian political activist and scholar, Sukarno, in these speeches, not only expressed his own political views, social perspectives, and philosophical thoughts, explaining the main goals of his decades of activity, but also provided rich knowledge about Indonesian history, society, and the national independence movement, enabling us to have a general understanding of the major changes that have taken place in Indonesian life in recent years. The most profound impression these outstanding speeches leave on people is that their words are filled with hatred for colonialism and brimming with love for their motherland and the fighting spirit for national independence and freedom. As you read, you seem to see how millions of Indonesians fought for their country's freedom and happiness, and you seem to feel the pulse of a great nation beating.

    In the long years of over three hundred years, the disasters brought to Indonesia by Dutch colonial rule were incomparably heavy. It stirred countless patriots to rise up and fight one after another. After the failure of the Indonesian people's anti-Dutch uprising in 1926-1927, the nationalist political party—the Indonesian Nationalist Party—was established. Sukarno was one of its founders. In 1929, Sukarno was arrested for actively participating in the national independence movement. However, he did not stop fighting. He titled his defense "Indonesia Accuses," and he turned the colonial court into a forum for accusing colonialism.

    In "Indonesia Accuses," Sukarno powerfully exposed the face of the colonizers with a large number of facts, eloquent logic, and passionate language. According to these colonizers, they came to Indonesia seemingly to "look for novelties" and "spread progress and civilization." But Sukarno replied: "No! The deep and fundamental root of colonialism lies solely in the desire to seek wealth and profit."

    Sukarno pointed out that in those years, foreign capitalists "surrounded Indonesia like ants surrounding a sugar bowl." The profits of foreign companies continued to increase, often exceeding 100%! For example, in 1924, the dividend of the Sumatran quinine enterprise was as high as 170%! Sukarno quoted a writer to describe how foreign capital exploited the Indonesian people: "A batch of large pipes, which have countless sub-pipes and are further divided into millions of small pipes, which take the chests of millions of Javanese as outlets, and all these pipes are connected to a mother pipe pumped by a powerful steam pump; and in private operation, every adventurer can connect with all the pipes and can use his own steam pump to draw things from the source..." In this way, the wealth transported by the Dutch from Indonesia every year exceeded 1.5 billion guilders. In this way, the blood and sweat of the Indonesian people were drained.

    In those years, Indonesian workers could only get wages that were "barely enough to avoid starvation," and peasants fled in large numbers under the enslavement of the "forced cultivation system." As for education, according to Dutch official statistics, the illiteracy rate among men was 97%, and the illiteracy rate among women was 99.5%. All this is the "progress and civilization" brought to Indonesia by the colonizers!

    The colonial court wanted to charge Sukarno with the crime of "inciting." But Sukarno retorted that the national independence movement was not incited by anyone; it arose from the suffering of the vast number of people who were enslaved and exploited. Therefore, Sukarno stood on the podium and said loudly: Imperialism is the real instigator, "Bring imperialism to the police and the court!"

    Sukarno emphasized in many speeches: "Our slogan is not begging, not pleading," but to unite the people and "strive for it ourselves." As early as 1930, he said: "Anyone who still hopes to get assistance from the imperialist system, anyone who still believes that the imperialists will 'bestow' 'happiness' upon them...anyone who still yearns for the West is completely blind to the real facts and knows nothing about reality." Sukarno also quoted Marx's words: "No class is willing to give up its rights automatically." Therefore, all victories of the people can only be the result of struggle.

    It was precisely because of the long-term struggle of the Indonesian people, because "at first a few people united to become a small number, a small number of people united to become a large number, a small unity became a large unity...its waves surging, impacting everywhere," that the revolution of August 17, 1945 finally broke out, and an independent Indonesia was born.

    However, Sukarno repeatedly explained the long-term nature of the struggle. He believed that "independence finally being forced to be recognized does not mean that our time to rest has arrived." The fact is just like this. The colonizers are always trying to regain the lost ground, and they have never stopped attacking and threatening Indonesia. Independent Indonesia has gone through a bumpy and tortuous road. Now, although the Indonesian people have passed the most difficult years, they still have to consolidate their independence and eliminate "the remnants of colonialism that have invaded every corner of society for decades or even hundreds of years." At the same time, they must liberate West Irian, which is still under colonial rule. Sukarno said: "The Indonesian people feel that the West Irian issue is like a thorn in the back, piercing into the heart!"

    Sukarno paid great attention to how to develop Indonesia's economy in many speeches. He believed that it is necessary to accumulate national capital and establish a national economy. "We must embark on a new road...implement industrialization"; this is "a matter concerning the life and death of the Indonesian nation." Sukarno, with great national confidence, advocated relying on his own strength to build the motherland first. He said: "For any nation, self-reliance and self-help are the keys to prosperity and happiness." He also advocated accepting foreign aid, but absolutely not sacrificing even a little bit of sovereignty and freedom because of this. Sukarno clearly elaborated on Indonesia's position in his speech during his visit to the United States, which showed the dignity and pride of the Indonesian people and the people of Eastern countries.

    A speech made by Sukarno on June 1, 1945, is an important document in modern Indonesian history. He put forward the famous "Five Principles of Nation-Building" here. These principles are: first, nationalism, that is, uniting the Indonesian nation to build a unified nation-state; second, internationalism, that is, striving for friendly cooperation with countries around the world on an equal basis; third, democracy and parliamentarism; fourth, social justice, "that is to say, not only political equality, but also economic equality...we must try to maintain common prosperity"; fifth, belief in the divine way, "Let us all believe in God. The Indonesian nation will be a country that gives everyone freedom of religion." These principles enable us to understand some characteristics of the Indonesian national system and national policy today.

    Sukarno also clearly elaborated on the basic principles of Indonesia's foreign policy in his speeches. In 1951, Sukarno pointed out: "We love peace and do not want to be interfered with, so our foreign policy is an independent foreign policy, the purpose of which is to promote friendship and peace throughout the world." He also repeatedly stated that the policy of peace and neutrality pursued by Indonesia is not passive, but to actively participate in the struggle to maintain peace and support the national independence of various countries. The active role played by Indonesia at the Bandung Asian-African Conference is the most obvious example. Sukarno's opening speech to the Asian-African Conference has become a historically significant speech. "We Asians and Africans must unite!" This great voice resonated in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people and formed a powerful force.

    These speeches by Sukarno reflect the fact that after experiencing centuries of pain under colonial rule, Indonesia has awakened, Asia has awakened, and the people of Eastern countries have stepped onto the international stage and are actively participating in the struggle to decide the fate of all mankind.

    In 1930, Sukarno predicted that the Indonesian people "must have enough strength and enough ability...to re-ascend to the height reached in the past, yes, even exceeding this height." Now, this prediction is being realized. (Attached picture)

    读“苏加诺演讲集”
    崔奇　　
    印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺的演讲集，已经同我国广大读者见面了。我们热烈欢迎它，并怀着极大的兴趣来阅读它。　　
    演讲集包括苏加诺从1945年至1956年期间发表的十七篇重要演讲和文件，以及1930年在万隆荷印殖民法庭上所作的长篇辩护词。作为印度尼西亚的政治活动家和学者，苏加诺在这些演讲中，不仅表达了他自己的政治见解、社会观点和哲学思想，说明了他几十年活动的主要目标，而且提供了关于印度尼西亚历史、社会和民族独立运动的丰富知识，使我们能够对于近些年来印度尼西亚生活中所发生的重大变化，有一个概括的了解。这些卓越的演讲给人们最深刻的印象是：它的字里行间充满着对殖民主义的憎恨，洋溢着对自己祖国的热爱和争取民族独立自由的战斗精神。当你阅读的时候，你就仿佛看到了千百万印度尼西亚人民怎样为祖国的自由幸福而奋斗，你就仿佛感觉到一个伟大民族的脉搏在跳动。　　
    在三百几十年的漫长的岁月里，荷兰殖民统治给印度尼西亚带来的灾难是无比沉重的。它激动着无数爱国者前仆后继地起来斗争。在1926—1927年印度尼西亚人民反对荷兰大起义失败之后，民族主义的政党——印度尼西亚国民党成立了。苏加诺是它的创始者之一。1929年，苏加诺由于积极参加民族独立运动而被捕。但是，他并没有停止斗争。他把他的辩护词题名为“印度尼西亚控诉”，他把殖民法庭变成了控诉殖民主义的讲坛。　
  　在“印度尼西亚控诉”中，苏加诺以大量的事实，雄辩的逻辑和火热的语言，有力地揭露了殖民者的面目。按照这些殖民者的说法，他们到印度尼西亚来似乎是为了“寻找新奇的东西”，并“传播进步和文明”。但是苏加诺回答说：“不！殖民主义的深刻的和根本的根源在于仅仅为了寻找财富和寻找利润的欲望。”　　
    苏加诺指出，在那些年代里，外国资本家“像蚂蚁包围糖罐一样来包围印度尼西亚”。外国企业的利润不断增加，往往超过100％。比如，1924年苏门答腊奎宁企业的股息即高达 170％！苏加诺引用一位作家的话来形容外国资本怎样榨取印度尼西亚人民：“一批大管子，它有无数分管并又分成数百万支细管，它以数百万爪哇人的胸膛为出口，而所有这些管子又与一个被有力的蒸汽唧筒抽压的母管连接起来；而在私人经营方面，每一个冒险家都能够同所有的管子发生联系，并且能够利用自己的蒸汽唧筒从源泉中吸取东西……。”就这样，荷兰每年从印度尼西亚运走的财富超过十五亿盾。就这样，印度尼西亚人民的血汗被吸干了。　　
    在那些年代里，印度尼西亚工人只能得到“仅仅不致饿死”的工资，农民在“强迫种植制”的奴役下大批逃亡。至于教育，据荷兰官方统计，男子当中文盲占97％，女子当中文盲占99.5％。这一切就是殖民者给印度尼西亚带来的“进步和文明”！　
    殖民法庭想要给苏加诺加以“煽动者”的罪名。但苏加诺驳斥说，民族独立运动并不是什么人煽动起来的，它是从广大人民遭受奴役和剥削的痛苦中产生出来的。因此，苏加诺站在讲坛上响亮地说：帝国主义才是真正的煽动者，“把帝国主义押到警察和法庭面前来吧！”
　　苏加诺在许多演讲中都强调：“我们的口号不是哀求，不是乞讨”，而是要使人民团结起来，“自己努力争取”。还在1930年，他说：“谁要是还希望从帝国主义制度那里得到援助，谁要是还相信帝国主义者会‘赐’给他们‘幸福’……谁要是还向往西方，那他就是一个完全看不见真正的事实，对现实毫无所知的人。”苏加诺并且引证马克思的话：“没有一个阶级愿意自动地放弃自己的权利。”因此，人民的一切胜利只能是斗争的结果。　　
    正是由于印度尼西亚人民的长期斗争，由于“起初几个人团结起来成为小数，小数人联合起来成为大数，小团结成为大团结……它的浪涛汹涌，四处冲击”，终于爆发了1945年8月17日的革命，诞生了独立的印度尼西亚。　　
    但是，苏加诺仍然一再说明斗争的长期性。他认为，“独立终于被迫承认，并不意味着我们休息的时候已经到来”。事实正是这样。殖民者时刻都想夺回已经丧失的阵地，他们从未停止对印度尼西亚的进攻和威胁。独立后的印度尼西亚曾经走过一段崎岖曲折的道路。现在，印度尼西亚人民虽然已经度过最艰苦的年月，但是还要巩固自己的独立，还要肃清“侵入社会各个角落已经几十年甚至几百年的殖民主义残余”。同时，还要去解放仍然处于殖民统治下的西伊里安。苏加诺说：“印度尼西亚人民感觉西伊里安问题有如针芒刺背，痛入心脾！”　　
    苏加诺在许多演讲中对于如何发展印度尼西亚的经济，给予很大注意。他认为，必须积累民族资本，建立民族经济。“我们必须走上一条新的道路……实行工业化”；这是“有关印度尼西亚民族生死存亡的问题”。苏加诺怀着极大的民族自信，主张首先要依赖自己的力量来建设祖国。他说：“对任何民族来说，自力更生和自助是走向繁荣和幸福的钥匙。”他也主张接受外来的援助，但绝不能因此而牺牲一点点主权和自由。苏加诺在访问美国的演讲中特别清楚地阐述了印度尼西亚的这种立场，它显示了印度尼西亚人民以及东方各国人民的尊严和自豪。
　　苏加诺在1945年6月1日所作的一篇演讲，是印度尼西亚近代历史上的一个重要文献。他在这里提出了著名的“建国五原则”。这些原则是：第一，民族主义，即团结印度尼西亚民族建立一个统一的民族国家；第二，国际主义，即力求在平等基础上与世界各国友好合作；第三，民主和议会制；第四，社会正义，“这就是说，不只是政治的平等，而且要在经济上我们也必须实行平等……要尽量保持共同繁荣”；第五，信仰神道，“让我们都信仰神。印度尼西亚国家将是给每人以信教自由的国家”。这些原则使我们了解到今天印度尼西亚国家制度和国家政策的一些特点。　　
    苏加诺在他的演讲中也清楚地阐明了印度尼西亚外交政策的基本原则。1951年，苏加诺就指出：“我们热爱和平，也不愿意受人干涉，因此我们的外交政策是独立的外交政策，目的是促进全世界的友谊与和平。”他并且一再说明印度尼西亚所奉行的和平中立政策并不是消极的，而是要积极参加维护和平的斗争，并支持各国的民族独立。印度尼西亚在万隆亚非会议上所起的积极作用，就是一个最明显的例子。苏加诺向亚非会议所作的开幕词已成为一篇具有历史意义的演讲。“我们亚洲人和非洲人必须团结起来！”这个伟大的声音在亿万人民的心中引起了共鸣，并且形成了强大的力量。　　
    苏加诺的这些演讲反映了这样一个事实，在经历了几个世纪的殖民主义统治的痛苦之后，印度尼西亚已经觉醒，亚洲已经觉醒，东方各国人民已经走上国际舞台，并且积极参加决定全人类的命运的斗争。　　
    1930年，苏加诺曾预言，印度尼西亚人民“必然有足够的力量和足够的能力……重新登上过去所达到的高度，是的，甚至超过这个高度。”现在，这个预言正在实现中。（附图片）
