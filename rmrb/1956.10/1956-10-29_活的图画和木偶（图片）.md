    The animated film group of the Shanghai Film Studio is an interesting art workshop. It is home to many artists and craftsmen who spend their time drawing and carving. Their works are lively actors with distinct personalities, performing in animated and puppet films loved by audiences.
    In order to create more lovable characters for children, the artists often go to kindergartens, rural areas, and zoos to sketch and observe life. They also raise animals. Not only that, but they have also visited famous scenic spots such as Tianmu Mountain, Huangshan Mountain, Taishan Mountain, and Suzhou and Hangzhou. However, children's interests are very broad, so the customs, costumes, and dramas of ancient figures have also become the subjects of their research. The soon-to-be-completed animated film "The Proud General" has absorbed many typical movements and stylized facial makeup from Peking Opera and local operas. This gives the film a distinct national style. In order to let children see a broader picture of life, the writers are now trying to create scripts based on modern children's life and are also writing some satirical comedies.
    This year, the animated film group of the Shanghai Film Studio has produced three animated films for children: the costume satire "The Proud General," the fairy tale "I Know," and "The Big Red Flower." In addition, a new animated film, "The Wooden Girl," is currently being prepared. In addition to the stage puppet documentary "Chinese Puppet Art," which has been completed, there are also the Yao ethnic myth "Iron Hoe and Golden Earring," the comedy "Fat Sister Returns to Her Mother's Home," the fable "Three Neighbors," and "The Witty Goat." In addition, another new film, "A New Football," is now being actively prepared and is expected to begin filming in December. These films will soon be meeting young audiences. Let us join the children in wishing these films a successful completion! (Jin Xi)
    Children captivated by an animated film.
    The color puppet film "Magic Brush" depicts the story of Ma Liang, a poor child who used to practice drawing diligently with branches and charcoal as his brushes. Later, a fairy gave him a magic brush that could make whatever he drew come to life. Ma Liang used this brush to draw livestock to help the farmers. Later, he was framed by a high official, but failed, and the high official died in the sea drawn by Ma Liang's magic brush. From then on, Ma Liang freely drew everything that the working people needed. This puppet film vividly and profoundly portrays the ugly features of the rulers and highlights the purity, diligence, and love for the people of the protagonist Ma Liang in "Magic Brush." This puppet film was written by Hong Xuntao and directed by Jin Xi. "Magic Brush" participated in the 8th International Children's Film Exhibition in Venice, Italy, this year and won the first prize for literary and artistic films for children aged eight to twelve. The picture shows a scene from the film - the waterwheel drawn with the magic brush has become a real waterwheel, and the farmers are all thanking Ma Liang.

    An animated film that is about to be drawn and filmed, "The Proud General." After the victory against the enemy, the proud general became complacent because of his underestimation of the enemy and gave up training, so he was finally defeated by the enemy. This is a scene of the general panicking when he hears that the enemy is coming.

    活的图画和木偶

    上海电影制片厂的美术片组，是一个有趣的美术工场。那里拥有很多的美术工作者和手工艺者，他们一年到头地画和刻。他们的作品却是活生生的、性格不同的演员，演出观众们喜爱的动画片和木偶片。
    为了给孩子们创作出更可爱的形象，美术工作者们时常到幼儿园、农村和动物园去画速写和观察生活，他们也饲养着动物。不仅是这样，天目山、黄山、泰山和苏州、杭州等著名的风景地方，也有他们的足迹。但是，孩子们的爱好是非常广阔的，因此古代人物的风俗、服饰和戏剧也成为他们研究的对象。即将完成的动画片“骄傲的将军”，就曾在京戏、地方戏中吸收了许多典型动作和脸谱化的造型。这样，使影片呈现出鲜明的民族风格。为了让孩子们看到更广阔的生活图景，剧作者们现在正尝试创作以现代儿童生活为题材的剧本，并且还编写一些讽刺喜剧。
    今年上海电影制片厂美术片组为孩子们摄制了三部动画片——古装讽刺剧“骄傲的将军”，童话剧“我知道”和“大红花”，此外，现在正在筹备一部新的动画片“木头姑娘”。木偶片除舞台木偶记录片“中国木偶艺术”已完成外，还有徭族神话“铁锄头与金耳环”，喜剧“胖嫂回娘家”，寓言剧“三个邻居”和“机智的山羊”。另外，现在又积极准备另一部新片“一个新足球”，预计12月份开始拍摄。这些影片不久就要和小观众们见面了。让我们和小朋友们一道来预祝这些影片胜利完成吧！　（靳夕）
    让动画片吸引住的孩子们。
    彩色木偶片“神笔”是描写从前一个贫苦学画的孩子马良，用树枝、木炭当笔辛勤地练画。后来，一个仙人送给他一枝神笔，能使所画的东西变成真的。马良就用这支笔画牲畜救助农民。后来被大官陷害未成，大官反倒死在马良神笔下的大海里，从此马良又自由地为劳动人民画出所需要的一切了。这部木偶片生动、深刻地刻划了统治者的丑态，更显出“神笔”中主人公马良的纯洁、刻苦和热爱人民的精神。这部木偶片由洪汛涛编剧、靳夕导演，“神笔”曾参加今年在意大利威尼斯举行的第八届国际儿童电影展览，获得了八岁到十二岁儿童文艺影片一等奖。图为影片中的一个镜头——用神笔画的水车变成了真的水车，农民们都来感谢马良。（中国电影发行公司供稿）
    即将绘制、拍摄完成的一部彩色动画片——“骄傲的将军”。骄傲的将军在抗敌胜利后，因为产生轻敌思想，放弃锻炼，骄傲起来了，所以终于被敌人击败。这是将军听到敌人来犯，惊慌失措的场面。
