Lenin's "Philosophical Notebooks" has now been completely translated and published in Chinese, which is a very gratifying event.

Lenin's "Philosophical Notebooks" is a great contribution to the treasure house of Marxist theory. His discussion of Marxist dialectics here, like his discussion of materialism in "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism," is of epoch-making significance. These achievements unprecedentedly advanced dialectical materialism, making a new stage appear in the history of the development of Marxist philosophy—the stage of Lenin.

The "Philosophical Notebooks" includes ten notebooks made by Lenin while studying philosophical works for about twenty years (1895-1916). After Lenin's death, these notebooks were first published in Volumes 9 and 12 of the "Collected Works of Lenin" published in 1929-1930. Since then, single editions have been printed in 1933, 1934, 1936, 1938 and 1947. The current Chinese version is translated according to the 1947 Russian single edition.

The era in which Lenin made the "Philosophical Notebooks" was precisely the era when the contradictions of capitalism were unprecedentedly acute and even erupted into imperialist war, and it was the eve of the proletarian revolution. This rapid and great change raised a series of new questions for which no ready-made answers could be found in the works of Marx and Engels, while the opportunists of the Second International completely exposed their true colors in this turbulent era and openly stood on the side of imperialism. In order to defend their betrayal, they used metaphysical and dogmatic methods to distort a series of issues, such as the stage of capitalist development, the nature of war, and the national question. Thus, the foundations of Marxism were distorted and destroyed. Therefore, Marxists must analyze and clarify the regularity of the new stage of historical development from a theoretical perspective based on the new situation, use sharp dialectical weapons to defeat the metaphysics and dogmatism on which the opportunists rely, consolidate and enrich the theoretical foundation of the proletarian revolution, and push Marxist philosophy forward. Lenin's theoretical activities during this period were aimed at this task.

The articles in the "Philosophical Notebooks" are arranged in chronological order. The first article, "Excerpts from Marx and Engels' 'The Holy Family'," was made in 1895. It can be clearly seen from Lenin's excerpts and his comments that this early work by Marx and Engels marked the beginning of their transition to a new world view. In the notes, Lenin selectively quoted a series of important historical materialist views that Marx and Engels began to put forward, especially emphasizing their ideas on the role of the masses of people in history. The date of the second article, "Excerpts from Feuerbach's 'Lectures on the Essence of Religion'," is unknown, but it may have been made after the 1905 Russian Revolution; because at that time, in order to oppose reactionary theories such as God-seeking and God-building, Lenin had engaged in writings on religious issues.

The following are the notes Lenin made when studying the problem of materialist dialectics in 1914-1916. This part is the basic core of the "Philosophical Notebooks." It includes excerpts from Hegel's "Science of Logic" and Hegel's "Lectures on the History of Philosophy"; in addition, there are excerpts from works such as Lassalle's "The Philosophy of Heraclitus the Obscure Philosopher of Ephesus," Aristotle's "Metaphysics," and Feuerbach's "Narration, Analysis and Criticism of Leibniz's Philosophy." The article "On the Question of Dialectics" was written by Lenin to summarize his experience in studying dialectics during this period. In these materials, Lenin developed materialist dialectics with his genius insights on the unity of dialectics, epistemology, and dialectical logic, providing us with the key to understanding the essence of dialectical materialism.

In the "Philosophical Notebooks," Lenin conducted in-depth research on the universal principles and laws of dialectics. He has many discussions on the principles of universal connection and development of dialectics. Through a critical analysis of Hegel's dialectics, he repeatedly emphasized and demonstrated the universal principle of connection and development, and refuted Hegel's mysticism of regarding connection and movement as merely the characteristics and principles of ideas. Lenin repeatedly pointed out the all-encompassing nature of connection. Connection is not a stagnant process, but a living transformation, a transformation from one state to another. In this sense, the principle of connection and the principle of development are also related. On the issue of the principle of development, Lenin refuted the vulgar view that regards development as a simple increase or decrease in quantity. He revealed that the development of all things is the generation, elimination, and mutual transformation of all things. He excavated from Hegel's dialectics the genius idea that the source of development and self-movement is internal contradiction, and pointed out that dialectics is the science of connection and movement. Lenin also has a large number of materials on the discussion of laws in the "Philosophical Notebooks." He explained Hegel's idea of the most essential connection, namely universal regularity, from a materialist perspective. He put forward outstanding insights on the three laws of dialectics in the "Philosophical Notebooks," but he paid special attention to the law of the unity and struggle of opposites. Through in-depth discussions in various aspects, he comprehensively demonstrated a new discovery: the unity and struggle of opposites is the core and essence of dialectics. Lenin revealed the source of the development and self-movement of the real world with this new discovery. He further explained the internal connection between the laws of dialectics with this new discovery, and explained that the law of the unity and struggle of opposites is the fundamental key to understanding other dialectical laws. Lenin repeatedly demonstrated the unity of opposites and the mutual connection and transformation of opposites in his notes. He repeatedly emphasized the importance of the mutual transformation of opposites, and pointed out that this is the truly dialectical view of opposites. After critically studying Hegel's "Science of Logic," Lenin comprehensively put forward sixteen elements of dialectics. These elements are of great significance for laying the methodological principles of materialist dialectics.

In the "Philosophical Notebooks," Lenin developed Marxist epistemology after "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism." He critically studied Hegel's views, pointed out the fallacies of idealist epistemology, especially Kant's epistemology, and repeatedly emphasized that "cognition is the reflection of nature by man." At the same time, he demonstrated the dialectical and staged nature of the cognitive process from various aspects, pointing out that people cannot immediately and completely reflect the external world and its regularity, but must go through complex and tortuous paths to continuously deepen the essence of things. Lenin convincingly explained the stages of the cognitive process, saying: "From vivid intuition to abstract thinking, and from abstract thinking to practice, this is the dialectical path of knowing the truth and knowing objective reality." Here he especially emphasized the role of practice in the cognitive process, revealing that practice runs through the entire cognitive process. It is the source of cognition, the purpose of cognition, and the criterion for testing truth. In the article "On the Question of Dialectics," Lenin thoroughly analyzed the epistemological roots of idealism. He pointed out: "Linearity and one-sidedness, rigidity and inflexibility, subjectivism and subjective blindness are the epistemological roots of idealism." In the "Philosophical Notebooks," Lenin also preliminarily drafted an outline for developing Marxist epistemology.

Lenin attached great importance to the issue of dialectical logic. There are many discussions on this issue in the "Philosophical Notebooks." Although these are still preliminary, unrefined arguments written for himself, it can already be seen that Lenin has initially defined dialectical logic. He pointed out that dialectical logic is different from formal logic. It does not simply study the external forms of thinking, but studies the laws of development of the specific content of the world and the laws of development of the understanding of the specific content of the world. It is a logic with content. Lenin further analyzed the relationship and transformation of concepts as the main content of dialectical logic. Lenin's views on logical categories and concept systems are valuable materials for establishing a concept system of dialectical logic in the future.

One of the most important contributions of Lenin's "Philosophical Notebooks" is the idea of the unity of dialectics, epistemology, and logic. According to the materials on dialectics, epistemology, and logic in the "Philosophical Notebooks," we can understand that the unity Lenin mentioned does not refer to the mutual cancellation of the three, but to the unity of the three in essence and the difference in expression. On this issue, further clarification should be made based on the large amount of material provided by Lenin.

In order to more fully and completely study the issue of materialist dialectics from all aspects in the "Philosophical Notebooks," Lenin also studied Hegel's "Lectures on the History of Philosophy" and other works, revealing the dialectical thoughts in these works. At the same time, by studying these works, he also provided extremely important and rich materials on the issue of the history of philosophy. Lenin demonstrated a model of Party spirit on this issue. He sharply portrayed the struggle between the two lines in the history of philosophy with sharp comments. In the "Excerpts from Hegel's 'Lectures on the History of Philosophy'," Lenin resolutely stood on the position of dialectical materialism from the beginning and refuted the attempt of idealism to distort the history of philosophy. Lenin sharply exposed Hegel's true colors of trying his best to slander and obliterate materialist views while trying his best to praise the idealist system. But at the same time, he gave extremely high evaluations to all of Hegel's achievements on the issue of the history of philosophy. Hegel believed that there was a relationship of inheritance between philosophical thoughts, advocated the historical principle of the development of philosophical thoughts, and paid great attention to summarizing the achievements of dialectical thoughts in the history of philosophy. Lenin excavated all these reasonable things. However, he did not simply list Hegel's advantages or disadvantages on the issue of the history of philosophy; his comments on Hegel and other thinkers in history, and his incisive insights on the issue of the history of philosophy, provided us with creative instructions on how to establish a science of the history of philosophy.

The last part of the "Philosophical Notebooks" is Lenin's notes and comments on the philosophical works of modern bourgeois idealism. Here Lenin criticized the schools of modern bourgeois idealism and their attempts to transplant idealism into natural science. At the same time, he exposed the vacillation between materialism and idealism of bourgeois natural scientists due to their class limitations.

The above is a very simple introduction to the content of Lenin's "Philosophical Notebooks," which is far from enough to explain the huge ideological wealth contained in the "Philosophical Notebooks," especially the outstanding viewpoints and the seeds of thought that have not yet been clarified. These are all worth further exploration.

The "Philosophical Notebooks" is a result of Lenin's many years of philosophical research. All his work in this area was for one purpose—to serve the Party's political struggle. Therefore, the "Philosophical Notebooks" must be studied in connection with Lenin's theoretical and practical activities during the First World War and the years after, so that we can more deeply understand the genius viewpoints in this work, and so that we can understand how Lenin used and continued to develop these viewpoints in his activities.

Lenin provided an example in the "Philosophical Notebooks" of how to treat the ideological wealth left over from history. His notes on Hegel's works are particularly prominent examples of critically treating the philosophical heritage. It can be said that after Marx and Engels, no one has criticized Hegel's idealism more sharply and profoundly than Lenin, but no one has given the highest and most accurate evaluation to the rational core in Hegel's philosophy like Lenin. Lenin himself said: "I always try my best to read Hegel's works from a materialist point of view." This is his fundamental attitude towards Hegel's philosophy. He not only made general evaluations of Hegel's works, but also carefully made detailed analyses of a series of issues in them. The same is true for other people's works. He seriously affirmed everything that is desirable with scientific analysis on the premise of not making any concessions to idealism. In him, we can never see the situation of simply making affirmative or negative conclusions without analysis and research. Therefore, he not only provided us with an example of treating various philosophical thoughts from a materialist standpoint, but also generally provided us with an example of creatively conducting scientific research work.

    列宁的“哲学笔记”
    林利
    列宁的“哲学笔记”一书，现在已全部译成中文出版，这是一件非常值得欢欣的事。
    列宁的“哲学笔记”是对马克思主义理论宝库的伟大贡献。他在这里对马克思主义辩证法的论述，就像他在“唯物主义和经验批判主义”中对唯物主义的论述一样，有着划时代的意义。这些成就空前地推进了辩证唯物主义，使得马克思主义哲学的发展史中出现了新的阶段——列宁的阶段。
      “哲学笔记”包括列宁在约二十年之内（1895—1916）研读哲学著作时所做的十本笔记。在列宁逝世后，这些笔记第一次在1929—1930年出版的“列宁文集”第九、十二卷中发表。此后，在1933、1934、1936、1938年和1947年又印行了单行本。现在出版的中文本，就是依照1947年的俄文单行本译出的。
    列宁做“哲学笔记”的年代正是资本主义矛盾空前剧烈以至爆发帝国主义战争的年代，正是无产阶级革命的前夜。这种急剧的大转变提出了一系列的从马克思、恩格斯著作中找不到现成答案的新问题，而第二国际的机会主义者们在这个动荡的时代，则完全暴露出自己的真面目，公开站到了帝国主义的立场上。他们为了替自己的叛变行为作辩护，使用形而上学的、教条主义的手法，曲解一系列的问题，如资本主义的发展阶段问题、战争的性质问题、民族问题等等。从而歪曲、破坏马克思主义的基础。因此，马克思主义者就必须根据新的情况从理论上来分析和阐明历史发展新阶段的规律性，以锐利的辩证法武器来击溃机会主义者所依据的形而上学、教条主义，来巩固和丰富无产阶级革命的理论基础，把马克思主义哲学推向前进。列宁在这个时期的理论活动就是针对着这个任务的。
      “哲学笔记”中各篇的排列是以年代先后为序的。第一篇“马克思和恩格斯‘神圣的家族’一书摘要”是在1895年做的。从列宁的摘录和他写的评语中可以清楚地看到，马克思和恩格斯的这部早期作品标志着他们转向新世界观的开始。列宁在笔记中有重点地摘引了马克思和恩格斯开始提出的一系列重要的历史唯物主义的观点，特别强调了他们关于人民群众在历史中的作用的思想。第二篇“费尔巴哈‘宗教本质讲演录’一书摘要”的年代不详，可能是1905年俄国革命之后做的；因为当时列宁为了反对寻神说、造神说之类的反动理论，曾经从事于有关宗教问题的著述。
    往下就是列宁在1914—1916年钻研唯物主义辩证法问题时所做的笔记。这个部分是“哲学笔记”的基本核心。这里包括黑格尔“逻辑学”和黑格尔“哲学史讲演录”两书的摘要；此外，还有拉萨尔“爱非斯的晦涩哲人赫拉克利特的哲学”、亚里士多德“形而上学”，费尔巴哈“对莱布尼茨哲学的叙述、分析和批判”等著作的摘要。“谈谈辩证法问题”一文就是列宁为总结他在这个时期钻研辩证法问题的心得而写的。在这些材料中列宁以关于辩证法、认识论、辩证逻辑三者的统一的天才见解发展了唯物主义辩证法，为我们提供了理解辩证唯物主义实质的钥匙。
    列宁在“哲学笔记”中对于辩证法的普遍原则和规律问题做了深入的研究。他关于辩证法的普遍联系和发展的原则论述极多。他通过对黑格尔辩证法的批判性的分析，多方面地强调了、论证了联系和发展的普遍原则，驳斥了黑格尔把联系和运动看做只是观念的特性和原则的神秘主义。列宁一再指出联系的包罗万象的性质，联系不是僵死的不动的过程，而是活的转化，从一种状态到另一种状态的转化，在这个意义上，联系原则和发展原则也是关联着的。列宁在发展原则的问题上驳斥了那种把发展看做简单的量的增减的庸俗观点。他揭示出一切事物的发展就是一切事物的产生、消灭、相互转化。他从黑格尔辩证法中发掘出关于发展、自己运动的根源是内部矛盾性这一天才思想，指出：辩证法就是关于联系和运动的科学。列宁在“哲学笔记”中论述规律问题的材料也是极多的，他以唯物主义的观点阐明了黑格尔关于最本质的联系即普遍规律性的思想。他在“哲学笔记”中对辩证法的三个规律都提出了卓越的见解，但他特别注意的就是对立面的统一和斗争的规律。他通过各方面的深入的探讨，概括地论证了一个新发现：对立面的统一和斗争是辩证法的核心和实质。列宁以这个新发现揭示了现实世界的发展、自己运动的根源。他以这个新发现进一步说明了辩证法各规律之间的内部联系，说明了对立面的统一和斗争的规律是理解其他辩证规律的根本关键。列宁在笔记中多次论证了对立面的统一，对立面的相互联系、转化。他一再强调对立面相互转化的重要意义，指出这是关于对立面的真正辩证的观点。列宁在批判地研究了黑格尔“逻辑学”之后，总括地提出了辩证法的十六个要素。这些要素对于奠定唯物主义辩证法的方法论原则具有重要的意义。
    列宁在“哲学笔记”中继“唯物主义和经验批判主义”之后发展了马克思主义认识论。他批判地研究了黑格尔的观点，指出了唯心主义认识论，尤其是康德的认识论观点的谬误，一再强调“认识是人对自然界的反映”。同时，他多方面地论证了认识过程的辩证性、阶段性，指出人们不能立即完整地反映外部世界及其规律性，而要经过复杂的曲折的途径，不断深入事物的本质。列宁令人信服地阐明了认识过程的阶段性，他说：“从生动的直观到抽象的思维，并从抽象的思维到实践，这就是认识真理、认识客观实在的辩证的途径。”这里他特别强调了实践在认识过程中的作用，揭示出实践是贯串在整个认识过程中的，它是认识的来源、认识的目的，是检验真理的准绳。在“谈谈辩证法问题”一文中，列宁透彻地分析了唯心主义的认识论根源，他指出：“直线性和片面性，死板和僵化，主观主义和主观盲目性就是唯心主义的认识论根源。”在
  “哲学笔记”中，列宁还初步拟出了发展马克思主义认识论的纲领。
    列宁对于辩证逻辑的问题非常重视。在“哲学笔记”中，关于这个问题的论述很多。虽然这还是些为他自己写的、初步提出的、未经加工的论点，但已经可以看出列宁为辩证逻辑初步下的定义。他指出：辩证逻辑不同于形式逻辑，它不是简单地研究思维的外在形式，而是研究世界具体内容的发展规律，研究对世界具体内容认识的发展规律的，它是有内容的逻辑。列宁并且进一步分析了作为辩证逻辑主要内容的概念的关系、转化。列宁关于逻辑范畴、概念体系的见解是今后建立辩证逻辑的概念体系的宝贵材料。
    列宁的“哲学笔记”中最主要的贡献之一，就是关于辩证法、认识论、逻辑的统一的思想。根据“哲学笔记”中关于辩证法、认识论、逻辑的各方面的材料，我们可以理解，列宁所说的统一不是指三者的相互抵销，而是指三者在本质上的统一和在表现形式上的不同。关于这个问题，还应该根据列宁所提供的大量材料加以进一步的阐明。
    列宁在“哲学笔记”中为了更充分完满地从各方面研究唯物主义辩证法问题，他还研读了黑格尔的“哲学史讲演录”以及其他著作，揭示了这些著作中的辩证法思想。同时，由于研读这些著作，他也提供了关于哲学史问题的极重要、极丰富的材料。列宁在这个问题上表现了党性的典范。他以尖锐的评语鲜明地刻画出了哲学史上两条路线的斗争。他在“黑格尔‘哲学史讲演录’一书摘要”中，一开始就坚决站在辩证唯物主义立场上驳斥唯心主义歪曲哲学史的企图。列宁尖锐地揭穿了黑格尔对唯物主义观点尽量诬蔑、抹煞而对唯心主义体系却尽量吹捧的真面目。但与此同时，他对黑格尔在哲学史问题上的一切成绩也都给以极高的评价。黑格尔认为哲学思想之间有继承性的连系，主张哲学思想发展的历史性的原则，非常注意概括哲学史中辩证法思想的成就。列宁发掘出了这一切合理的东西。然而他并不是简单列举黑格尔在哲学史问题上的优点或缺点；他对黑格尔及历史上其他思想家的评语，他对哲学史问题的精辟的见解，为我们提出了如何建立一门科学的哲学史的创造性指示。
      “哲学笔记”的最后一部分，是列宁对现代资产阶级唯心主义哲学著作的札记和评语。列宁在这里批判了现代资产阶级唯心主义的流派以及他们把唯心主义移植到自然科学中去的企图，同时他揭露了资产阶级自然科学家由于其阶级局限性而在唯物主义和唯心主义之间的动摇。
    以上是关于列宁“哲学笔记”内容的极简单的介绍，远不能说明“哲学笔记”中蕴藏着的巨大的思想财富，尤其是其中尚未得到阐明的卓越观点、思想的萌芽。这些都值得进一步加以发掘。
      “哲学笔记”是列宁多年研究哲学的一个成果。他在这方面的全部工作都是为着一个目的——为党的政治斗争服务。因此，必须把“哲学笔记”同列宁在第一次世界大战期间及以后的年代里的理论活动和实践活动连系起来研究，才可以更深入地了解这部著作中的天才观点，才可以明了列宁在他的活动中如何运用并继续发展这些观点。
    列宁在“哲学笔记”中提供了应当如何对待历史上遗留下来的思想财富的范例。他的有关黑格尔著作的笔记尤其是批判地对待哲学遗产的突出例子。可以说，在马克思和恩格斯之后，还没有人比列宁更尖锐更深刻地批判黑格尔的唯心主义，然而也没有人像列宁那样对黑格尔哲学中合理的内核给予了最高最确切的评价。列宁自己说：“我总是竭力用唯物主义观点来读黑格尔的著作”，这就是他对黑格尔哲学的根本态度。他不仅对黑格尔的著作做了一般性的评价，而且对其中一系列的问题都认真地做了详尽的分析。对于其他人的著作也是如此，他在对唯心主义不做丝毫让步的前提下，认真地用科学的分析肯定一切可取的东西。在他那里，我们决看不到不加分析研究就简单地做出肯定或否定的结论的情况。因此，他不仅给我们提供了从唯物主义立场去对待各种哲学思想的榜样，而且给我们一般地提供了创造性地进行科学研究工作的榜样。
