    Starting to Pay Attention to Construction Safety
  　The Shizitan Hydropower Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry wrote: The article "Can Human Life Be Treated This Way?" published in the People's Daily on August 6 was a correct criticism of us.
    The personal injury accidents at the Shizitan Hydropower Station construction site were indeed very serious. In particular, in July, minor injuries increased, and serious injuries occurred several times in a row. Most of these accidents were caused by some construction leaders not paying enough attention to safety, not educating workers enough on complying with operating procedures, and the lack of necessary safety facilities.
    Recently, our bureau has re-formulated the responsibility system for safety production at all levels of leadership and stipulated more detailed methods on how to ensure safety. In order to widely arouse the attention of all employees to safety, firmly establish the concept of safe production, and summarize the experience of units that have done well in ensuring safe production, exchanges were conducted and awards were given; on this basis, a hundred-day safety campaign was further launched.

专栏：对批评的反应

    开始注意施工安全
  　电力工业部狮子滩水力发电工程局来信说：8月6日人民日报发表“难道可以这样对待人的生命吗”一文，对我们的批评是正确的。
    狮子滩水电站工地的人身事故确实很严重，特别是7月份，轻伤事故增加，重伤事故连续发生几起，这些事故大部分都是因为部分施工领导干部对安全重视不够，对工人遵守操作规程的教育不够和缺乏必要的安全设施所造成的。
    最近，我局已重新拟定了各级领导对安全生产的责任制度，并规定了如何保证安全较详尽的办法。为了广泛地引起全体职工对安全的重视，牢固的树立起安全生产的思想，并总结了对保证安全生产作得好的单位的经验，进行了交流，发了奖；在此基础上，进一步开展了百日安全运动。
