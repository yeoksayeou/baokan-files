Xinhua News Agency, October 17th, dispatch from TASS, Paris: The situation in Algeria remains tense. Newspapers report that approximately 5,000 French troops conducted a large-scale "mopping-up" operation in the Shahel mountain region west of Algiers on the 15th. They surrounded an area of approximately 300 square kilometers, completely isolating it from the outside world. Within this area are sixteen towns and many villages, with a total population of approximately 40,000. Simultaneously, in the city of Blida, Algerian insurgents attacked a detachment of French troops, killing twelve and wounding four French soldiers.

Currently, the will of the broad masses of the French people to demand a cessation of military action in Algeria has become increasingly resolute. According to the Seine Province Peace Council, among the 300,000 residents surveyed in the province, the vast majority advocate for peace in Algeria and have signed the petition of the National Peace Council.

National Assembly member Husquivens, who participated in the Socialist Party parliamentary delegation's visit to North Africa this summer, sharply condemned the persecution of Algerians under the guise of the so-called "appeasement" policy in the "Toulouse Telegraph."

"L'Humanité" stated that in the department of Dordogne, many mayors of cities and settlements advocate for peace in Algeria. These mayors include Communist Party members, Socialist Party members, and representatives from other parties.

Xinhua News Agency, October 15th, dispatch from TASS, Paris, October 14th: Approximately 500 women representatives from women's organizations in thirty-two French provinces responded to the initiative of the French Women's Union and held a gathering in Paris on October 13th, demanding a cessation of military action in Algeria. The representatives participating in the gathering unanimously passed a resolution stating, "We do not want to lose our sons, we do not want French and Algerian mothers to worry about the lives of their children, we want the just peace that everyone desires."

Subsequently, the representatives went to the Prime Minister's residence to deliver a petition demanding the withdrawal of French troops from Algeria. In Paris, the suburbs of Paris, and the Seine-et-Oise department alone, more than 160,000 women signed the petition. (Attached image)

    法国人民要求实现阿尔及利亚和平
    各省妇女代表集会敦促政府停止军事行动
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：阿尔及利亚的局势仍旧紧张。报纸报道，法国军队约五千人15日在阿尔及尔以西的沙海尔山区进行了大规模“扫荡”。他们包围了方圆约三百平方公里的地区，使它同外界完全隔绝。在这个地区内有十六个城镇和许多村庄，人口共约四万人。同时，在布利达市，阿尔及利亚的起义者攻击了法军的一个支队。法国士兵十二人被打死，四人受伤。
    目前法国广大人民要求在阿尔及利亚停止军事行动的意志已经越来越坚决。据塞纳省和平理事会说，在这个省被征求过意见的三十万居民中，绝大多数人都主张在阿尔及利亚实现和平，他们还在全国和平理事会的请愿书上签了名。
    今年夏天参加社会党议员访问北非代表团的国民议会议员许斯基文斯基在“都鲁斯电讯报”上尖锐地谴责在所谓“绥靖”政策的口号下对阿尔及利亚人进行迫害。
    “人道报”说，在多顿涅省，许多城市和居民点的市长都主张在阿尔及利亚实现和平。这些市长当中有共产党员、社会党员和其他党派的代表。
    新华社15日讯　塔斯社巴黎14日讯：法国三十二个省的妇女组织的大约五百名妇女代表响应法兰西妇女联盟的倡议，10月13日在巴黎举行集会，要求停止在阿尔及利亚的军事行动。参加集会的代表们一致通过一项决议，决议中说：“我们不希望丧失自己的儿子，我们不希望法国和阿尔及利亚的母亲为自己孩子的生命而耽心，我们希望的是大家所愿望的正义的和平。”
    随后，代表们前往政府首脑官邸，递交了要求撤回法国在阿尔及利亚的军队的请愿书。单是在巴黎、巴黎各郊区和塞纳—瓦斯省的妇女请愿书上签名的就有十六万多人。（附图片）
