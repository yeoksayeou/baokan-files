    Childlike Heart
    ——Hanoi Letters
    Yuan Ying
    When I arrived in Hanoi, I had a special package of gifts in my suitcase. These gifts were neither picture cards from the Xinhua Bookstore nor handicrafts from the department stores or Dong'an Market. Perhaps it could be said that these gifts were simply not available for purchase in the market.
    I am referring to bookmarks with handwritten calligraphy and toys made of cotton attached to pieces of paper – little trinkets made by hand. These were given to me by some Young Pioneers in Beijing to bring to Vietnam.
    Let me just pick out a small paper box at random for you to look at: this is a small box, one inch cubed, made of paper. The lid reads: "To Our Dear Vietnamese Friends." The gift-giver is Chen Derong, a fifth-grade student at the First Central Elementary School in Xidan District, Beijing.
    Now, please open the paper box and take a look: on top is a small wad of cotton. Gently pull the cotton aside, and you can lift a string of small zongzi (rice dumplings) tied together with colored silk thread. These colorful little zongzi will remind you of the Dragon Boat Festival and awaken dreamlike memories of childhood.
    Chen Derong has tied every single thread of friendship for the faraway Vietnamese children into these little zongzi.
    For these gifts, the Hanoi Children's Club specially arranged a program at the Mid-Autumn Festival party, giving me the opportunity to present them to over a thousand Vietnamese children. It was a grand and enthusiastic "gift-giving" ceremony. A Vietnamese girl tied a red scarf around my neck on stage.
    I knew that this red scarf tightly linked the hands of friendship between the children of our two countries.
    But what I want to tell you now is not about this red scarf.
    We visited the South Vietnamese Children's Home in the suburbs of Hanoi, a nursery specifically for children who had gathered in the North from South Vietnam. There are over two hundred children here, the youngest being two years old and the oldest seven. Some of their parents sacrificed themselves in the war of resistance, some work in government offices, and some are still in the South.
    You can believe that they have never seen Chinese children, and perhaps they do not even recognize the two characters "China." But they still crowded around us, vying with each other to grab our hands and shouting "Uncle China, Uncle China."
    Suddenly, a girl stuffed something into my hand. I looked closely and saw that it was a small garment folded out of old newspaper. Her voice was so low that I and the translator had to bend down to listen. She said:
    "This is for you, please take it to the Chinese children."
    I immediately clipped it into my notebook, thanked her, and told her that I would definitely take it.
    After that, children came one after another to put things in my hands, all folded out of old newspaper. Among them were little people, little monkeys, little tables,... Some said a word, some didn't say a word, dropped the item, and turned to leave. Finally, a girl of about six or seven years old came to me and handed me a small mud boat. Her voice was loud. She said:
    "I want to take this boat to see the Chinese children."
    The adults around us laughed. But she said it very seriously, without smiling at all herself, and none of the children around us smiled either, as if it were not a laughing matter at all.
    So, in my suitcase that I will bring back home, there is now an even more special package of gifts. (September 24th)

    童心
    ——河内书简
    袁鹰
    当我到河内的时候，在我的旅行皮箱里，有一包特别的礼品。这些礼品，既不是新华书店的画片，也不是百货大楼或者东安市场的手工艺品。也许可以说，这些礼品，在市场上根本就买不到。
    我说的是一些笔画的书签、用棉花贴在纸片上的玩具，亲手制成的小玩意。这是北京市一些少先队员们让我带到越南来的。
    我且随手拿出一个小纸盒给你看吧：这是一个一寸立方的自己用纸糊的小盒。盒盖写着：“送给亲爱的越南小朋友”。送礼物的是北京市西单区第一中心小学五年级学生陈德蓉。
    现在，请你打开纸盒瞧一瞧：上面是一小团棉花，轻轻拨开棉花，你就能提起一串用彩色丝线扎起来的小粽子来。这几只彩色小粽子，使你想起了端午节，唤起了童年的梦一般的记忆。
    陈德蓉，把对遥远的越南小朋友的友情，一丝一丝地都结在这几只小粽子上了。
    为了这些礼品，河内市少年俱乐部在中秋节的联欢会上，特别安排了一个节目，让我有机会在一千多越南小朋友们面前送出它们。这是一个隆重而又热烈的“赠礼”仪式。一个越南女孩子在台上为我系上一条红领巾。
    我知道，这条红领巾，把两国孩子们的友谊的手紧紧地拉在一起了。
    但是，我现在要告诉你的，还不是这条红领巾。
    我们曾经参观在河内市郊的南越儿童院，这是一个专门收纳从南越集结到北方来的孩子的托儿所。这里有二百多个孩子，最小的两岁，最大的七岁。他们的家长，有的在抗战中牺牲了，有的在机关工作，有的现在还在南部。
    你可以相信，他们都没有看见过中国孩子，甚至也许还不认识“中国”这两个字。可是他们却始终争先恐后地围住我们，拉住我们的手，嚷着“中国伯伯，中国伯伯。”
    忽然，有一个女孩子往我手里塞进一件东西，我定睛一看，原来是用旧报纸折成的小衣服。她的声音很低，以至我和翻译同志不得不俯下身来听。她说：
    “这送给你，请你带给中国小朋友。”
    我立刻把它夹在我的本子里，谢谢她，并且告诉她我一定带到。
    这以后，接二连三地有孩子往我手上放东西，而且都是用旧报纸折成的。其中有小人，小猴子，小桌子，……。他们有的说一句话，有的一句也不说，放了转身就走。最后，有一个大约六、七岁的女孩子走到我的面前，递给我一只小泥船。她的声音很大，她说：
    “我要坐这只船去看看中国小朋友。”
    四周的大人们都笑起来了。可是她说得很认真，自己一点没有笑，拥在我们身旁的所有的孩子们也都没有笑，仿佛这根本不是什么可笑的事。
    于是，在我的将来带回国的旅行皮箱里，就有了一包更加特别的礼品。　（九月二十四日）
