    To Solemnly and Warmly Commemorate the Ninetieth Anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's Birth
    Shao Lizi
    The Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference recently held an enlarged meeting and decided to solemnly commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth, and established a commemorative preparatory committee. The National Committee of the CPPCC and the CPPCC committees of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities will hold grand commemorative meetings on the eve and on the day of the anniversary, and will invite friends of Mr. Sun Yat-sen during his lifetime to Beijing to participate in the commemoration. National newspapers and relevant departments will adopt various methods to widely conduct publicity and education work on Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary deeds through this commemorative activity. This significant decision of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference reflects and represents the Chinese people's respect and remembrance of the great pioneer of the Chinese revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and also conforms to the world people's admiration for this great revolutionary.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen was born on November 12, 1866, in Cuiheng Village, Xiangshan County (now Zhongshan County), Guangdong Province. At that time, it was six years after the Anglo-French Allied Forces invaded Beijing and three years after the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement. It was the early stage when international capitalism invaded China, turning China into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, and helping the Qing Dynasty rulers to crush the Chinese people's resistance movement. During the Sino-French War from 1884 to 1885, Mr. Sun Yat-sen was nearly twenty years old and still studying in Hong Kong. He was deeply indignant at the French aggression and the Qing Dynasty's concessions. Coincidentally, a French warship arrived in Hong Kong for repairs, and Chinese workers refused to work because it was an enemy ship. This enthusiastic patriotic action further inspired Mr. Sun Yat-sen's courage to defend against foreign insults. He later said: "Since the year of the Sino-French War in Yiyou, I have had the ambition to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and establish a republic." In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, Japanese imperialism, with the full support of American imperialism, occupied Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. Mr. Sun Yat-sen successively organized the Xingzhonghui in Honolulu and Hong Kong, and launched the first armed uprising in Guangzhou the following year, which failed due to exposure. In 1896, he fled to London and was imprisoned by the Qing legation, but was rescued with the help of British friends. From then until the establishment of the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance in 1905, and the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, Mr. Sun Yat-sen experienced countless setbacks. He traveled overseas, experiencing Japan, Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Europe, and the United States, to publicize the revolution to overseas Chinese, recruit comrades, and establish institutions to command uprisings in Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Hanoi. He had some contact with social figures from various countries, especially social figures from Japan. However, the governments of imperialist countries and colonies mostly supported the Qing Dynasty rulers. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was deported from Japan, Southeast Asia, Vietnam, and Siam. Hong Kong and Yokohama even refused him transit ashore. However, for the sake of China's freedom and equality, and for the benefit and happiness of the people, Mr. Sun Yat-sen persisted in carrying out the revolution, unyielding, and persevering, and finally achieved the great achievement of overthrowing the rule of the Qing Dynasty and ending China's feudal monarchy for more than two thousand years. This achievement has great significance in both Chinese and world history.
    Unfortunately, the fruits of the Xinhai Revolution were usurped by the Northern Warlords; Mr. Sun Yat-sen continued to fight against Yuan Shikai, to protect the Constitution, and to oppose participation in the First World Imperialist War. After many setbacks, he saw clearly the aggressive faces of imperialism and further realized the new strength of the Russian Revolution against imperialism. When the Russian February Revolution began in 1917, he praised it; after the October Revolution, in 1918, he telegraphed Lenin in Shanghai, congratulating the success of the Soviet Russian Revolution. Later, Mr. Sun Yat-sen had close communications and sincere talks with the Soviet government and envoys, and he was determined to guide the Chinese revolution in the direction of the October Revolution. At the end of 1923, he established the three major revolutionary policies of "alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers." At the beginning of 1924, the First National Congress was held and the Kuomintang was reorganized. He resolutely said to some stubborn opponents: "If you oppose it again, I will dissolve the Kuomintang and join the Communist Party myself." He also wrote a letter to Chiang Kai-shek saying: "Today's revolution must learn from Russia... Our party's future revolution will not succeed without taking Russia as a teacher." At the end of 1924, Mr. Sun Yat-sen rode north alone to fight for the convening of the National Assembly and the abolition of unequal treaties. On March 12, 1925, he died in Beijing due to a recurrence of accumulated illness. He left behind a will stating "We must awaken the people and unite with nations that treat us equally in the world to fight together," and a letter to the Soviet Union stating "Dawn is near, at which time the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally."
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen's life was a life of revolutionary struggle, a life of advocating patriotism, a life of resisting imperialism and colonialism, and a life of pursuing national prosperity, people's well-being, and world harmony. In his later years, his political thought and revolutionary direction had a higher level of development. His three major policies and the spirit of taking Russia as a teacher pointed out the correct path for the Chinese democratic revolutionaries to connect with the international and domestic proletarian movements to strive for Chinese national independence. This development not only had guiding significance for the Chinese people and the world people at that time, but also plays an encouraging role in the anti-colonial struggle of Asian, African, and South American countries today. Not long ago, Indonesian President Sukarno praised Mr. Sun Yat-sen's greatness and the influence on the Indonesian revolution many times during his visit to China, which is a powerful illustration.
    This time, we solemnly and warmly commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth, on the one hand, to cherish the immortal achievements of the great revolutionary pioneer, and on the other hand, to enable the people of the whole country, especially the young comrades, to further understand Mr. Sun Yat-sen's noble qualities of loving the motherland, his revolutionary actions of arduous struggle, and his continuously progressive ideological spirit, improve the education of modern history, and thus give full play to the positive role of working harder to build the socialist motherland.
    While the Chinese people are enthusiastically preparing to commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth, foreign news reports that Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan are also engaged in commemorative preparations. From the perspective of holding commemorative activities, they have not forgotten Mr. Sun Yat-sen, which is very good. But it is very strange that they still say "resist Russia and oppose communism." If they review the "Complete Works of the Premier" again, they will never find a single word or phrase in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's entire legacy that contains any meaning of "resist Russia and oppose communism." In addition to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's statement on the three major policies mentioned above, he said more than once in his lectures on the Three Principles of the People that the Principle of People's Livelihood is socialism and communism, and he also said more than once that communism is a good friend of the Principle of People's Livelihood; he also praised the achievements of the October Revolution and the superior state system of the Soviet Union more than once. If Mr. Sun Yat-sen were still alive, I dare say that he would become one of the great leaders of today's Chinese socialist revolution and socialist construction. Under the call of the patriotic spirit and the ideological consciousness of resisting imperialism and colonialism that runs through the entire legacy of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, we can still join hands with the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan again, and use peaceful negotiations to solve our own internal affairs and realize the complete reunification of the motherland. This is of immeasurable significance for us to strengthen socialist construction and maintain lasting peace in Asia and the world. We want to unite all the forces that can be united and mobilize all positive factors to serve socialism. The door of the motherland is always open to all patriots. Therefore, as long as the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan do not distort Mr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy out of thin air, our call to solemnly and warmly commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth can also include them. Let us unite under the banner of peaceful national construction that Mr. Sun Yat-sen sought throughout his life and has now been realized!

    要隆重热烈地纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年
    邵力子
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会最近举行的扩大会议，决定隆重纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年，并且成立了纪念筹备委员会。政协全国委员会和各省、自治区、市政协委员会将分别在诞辰前夕和诞辰当天举行隆重的纪念大会，并且邀请国外孙中山先生生前的友好到北京来参加纪念。全国报纸和有关部门都将采取各种各样的方式，通过这次纪念活动，广泛地进行有关孙中山先生革命事迹的宣传教育工作。中国人民政协这一具有重大意义的决定，反映和代表了中国人民对于伟大的中国革命先行者孙中山先生的尊敬和怀念，也符合了世界人民对于这位伟大革命家的崇仰的心意。
    孙中山先生在1866年11月12日，广东省香山县（现名中山县）翠亨村诞生。时当英法联军攻入北京后六年，太平天国革命运动后三年，正是国际资本主义侵入中国，变中国为半殖民地半封建社会，帮助清朝统治者摧残中国人民反抗运动的初期。1884年到1885年的中法之战，孙中山先生将满二十岁，还在香港就学，对法国的侵略和清朝的退让深表愤慨。恰有一只法国兵轮开到香港修理，中国工人因为这是敌舰，拒绝工作。这一热烈爱国的行动更激发了孙中山先生发愤御侮的勇气。他以后就曾说：“余自乙酉中法战败之年，始生倾复清延创建民国之志”。1894年的甲午之战，日帝国主义得到美帝国主义的充分支持，侵占了我国的台湾和澎湖列岛。孙中山先生先后在檀香山和香港组织兴中会，次年在广州发动第一次武装起义，事泄失败。1896年他逃亡伦敦，被清使馆用计囚禁，幸得英国友人帮助脱险。从此到1905年建立中国革命同盟会，到1911年的辛亥革命，孙中山先生经过无数次的挫折。他奔走海外，几度经历日本、南洋、越南、欧美等地，向各处华侨宣传革命，征集同志，并在香港、东京、河内等处设立指挥起义的机构。他和各国的社会人士，特别是日本的社会人士有所联系。但是那时帝国主义国家和殖民地的政府，大都支持清朝统治者，孙中山先生在日本、在南洋、在越南、在暹罗都曾被驱逐出境。香港、横滨且曾拒绝他过境上岸。然而孙中山先生为着求中国的自由平等，为着谋民众的利益幸福，坚持进行革命，不屈不挠，再接再厉，终于获得推翻了清朝的统治，结束了中国两千多年来的封建帝制的伟大成就。这个成就无论在中国历史和世界历史上都具有重大的意义。
    辛亥革命的成果不幸被北洋军阀所篡窃；孙中山先生继续进行讨袁、护法和反对参加第一次世界帝国主义大战的斗争。又经过多次的挫折，他看清了帝国主义的侵略嘴脸，进一步认识到反抗帝国主义的俄国革命的新生力量。当1917年俄国二月革命开始，他就加以称赞；到了十月革命后，1918年他就在上海致电列宁，祝贺苏俄革命的成功。以后孙中山先生就同苏联政府及使节有了亲切的通讯和恳谈，他决心把中国革命引导到十月革命的方向。1923年底，他确定了“联俄、联共、扶助农工”革命三大政策。1924年初，召开了第一次全国代表大会，改组了国民党。他毅然对某些反对的顽固派说：“你们如再反对，我就解散国民党，自己去加入共产党好了。”他又亲笔写信致蒋介石说：“今日革命非学俄国不可。……我党今后之革命非以俄为师断无成就”。1924年底，孙中山先生单骑北上，为召开国民会议和废除不平等条约作了最后的斗争。1925年3月12日，他在北京因积病复发，不治逝世。他留下“必须唤起民众及联合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奋斗”的遗嘱，和致苏联“不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国”的遗书。
    孙中山先生的一生，是革命奋斗的一生，是宣扬爱国的一生，是反抗帝国主义、殖民主义的一生，是追求国家富强、人民康乐、世界大同的一生。到了晚年，他的政治思想和革命方向更有了高度的发展。他的三大政策和以俄为师的精神，指出了中国民主革命派应与国际和国内无产阶级运动相联系以争取中国民族独立的正确的道路。这一发展，不仅在当时对于中国人民和世界人民具有指导的意义，就是现在亚非南美各国的反殖民主义斗争中，也还起着鼓舞的作用。不久以前，印度尼西亚苏加诺总统访问中国时，曾屡次称赞孙中山先生的伟大和对于印度尼西亚革命所起的影响，就是有力的说明。
    我们这次隆重热烈地纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年，一面是追怀伟大的革命先行者的不朽功绩，一面要使全国人民，尤其是青年同志们对于孙中山先生的热爱祖国的崇高品质，坚苦奋斗的革命行动，不断进步的思想精神，更作进一步的认识，提高现代史的教育，从而发挥加倍努力建设社会主义祖国的积极作用。
    在中国人民热烈筹备纪念孙中山先生九十周年诞辰的同时，外电传来台湾的国民党军政人员等也在从事于纪念的筹备。从举行纪念来说，他们还没有忘记孙中山先生，这是很好的。但是他们依然说什么
  “抗俄反共”，那是非常奇怪的事。如果他们重温一遍“总理全集”，是决不会从孙中山先生全部遗教里，找出只字片言，含有什么“抗俄反共”的意义的。除了前面所引的孙中山先生关于三大政策的表示外，他在三民主义演讲里，不止一次说民生主义就是社会主义，就是共产主义，也不止一次地说共产主义是民生主义的好朋友；更不止一次地称赞十月革命的成就和苏联优越的国家制度。孙中山先生如尚在世，我敢断言他会成为今天中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大领导者之一的。在全部孙中山先生遗教里所贯串的爱国精神和反抗帝国主义、反抗殖民主义的思想意识的号召下，我们仍然可以同台湾国民党军政人员重新携手团结起来，用和平谈判的方式，解决自己内政的问题，实现祖国的完全统一。这对于我们加强社会主义的建设和维持亚洲和世界的持久和平都具有不可衡量的意义。我们是要团结一切可以团结的力量，调动一切积极因素为社会主义服务的。祖国的大门对于所有爱国分子永远是敞开着的。因此，只要台湾国民党军政人员不是无中生有地歪曲孙中山先生的遗教，我们号召隆重热烈地纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年，也可以包括他们在内的。让我们团结在孙中山先生毕生以求而今实现的和平建国的旗帜之下吧！
