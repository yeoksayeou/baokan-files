    Yong Opera Has Never Been Performed in Cantonese
    In the article "Don't Use Mandarin to Change the Performance of Opera" by Yan Jiusi published on page 8 on September 11, it said: "The Nanning Yong Opera Troupe in Guangxi Province originally performed in Cantonese, but not long ago they switched to Guilin Mandarin (only Guilin Mandarin),..." In fact, Yong Opera originated more than a hundred years ago. At that time, the singing style used Nanning Mandarin, which is close to Guilin Mandarin. More than thirty years ago, the tune gradually focused on Cantonese opera, but still maintained its characteristics, and the dialogue was entirely in Nanning Mandarin. Since liberation, it has also been performed entirely in Nanning Mandarin.

    邕剧从来都不用广东话演唱
    9月11日第八版上刊登严九思的题为“不要用普通话去改变戏曲的演唱”一文说：“广西省南宁的邕剧团原是用广东话演唱的，不久以前改用桂林官话（只是桂林官话），……”其实，邕剧始于百余年前，当时的唱腔是用南宁官话，和桂林官话接近；三十余年前，在腔调上渐渐以粤剧为主，但还保持其特点，唱白全用南宁官话；解放以后，也全是用南宁官话演唱的。
