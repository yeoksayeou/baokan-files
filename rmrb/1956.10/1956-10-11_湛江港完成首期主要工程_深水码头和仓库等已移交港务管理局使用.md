Zhanjiang Port Completes First Phase of Major Construction
Deep-Water Berths, Warehouses, and Other Facilities Transferred to Port Authority

(Our Dispatch) The Port Construction Engineering Bureau of the Navigation Engineering General Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, responsible for the construction of Zhanjiang Port, has recently transferred a deep-water berth capable of accommodating two 10,000-ton ocean vessels, four new-style warehouses, a row of several gantry cranes, and channels and port vessels suitable for the entry, exit, and berthing of large ships to the Zhanjiang Port Authority for use. In addition, seven port railway lines with a total length of 10.2 kilometers have been built in Zhanjiang Port. This port will soon undertake the task of facilitating domestic and international material exchange.

Since the 14th plenary meeting of the State Council on July 4, 1955, passed the decision to construct Zhanjiang Port, the entire workforce participating in the port construction project has completed 70% of the workload of the first phase of the project after one year and two months, and several major projects have also been completed. During this period, the workers continuously demonstrated their initiative and creativity. By the middle of September, the workers had submitted a total of 3,471 rationalization proposals, of which 1,476 have been adopted. In addition, 381 advanced port construction experiences have been promoted. According to incomplete statistics, this has saved the country more than 1 million yuan while also creating more than 70,000 yuan in value. For example, in the installation of the rear hammer of the gantry crane, the use of waste iron concrete to replace cast iron saved the country 96 tons of cast iron, worth about 14,000 yuan. Li A'ge, an old worker on the chain-bucket dredger, created an advanced method of moving the main anchor without stopping, which can dredge an additional 16,800 cubic meters of mud per year.

Over the past year, 2,876 model heroes and advanced producers have emerged in the port construction project, and 144 units have been selected as advanced units. Many migrant workers and apprentices have recently been promoted to formal workers or skilled workers.

    湛江港完成首期主要工程
    深水码头和仓库等已移交港务管理局使用
    本报讯　负责建设湛江港的交通部航务工程总局建港工程局，最近已经把一座能够停泊两艘万吨巨轮的深水码头、四座新型仓库、一排数座龙门式起重机，以及适合巨轮出入和停泊的航道和港船，移交给湛江港务管理局使用。此外，湛江港还有七条总长十点二公里的港区铁路线已经筑成。这个港口不久将负起沟通国内外物资交流的任务。
    自从1955年7月4日国务院第十四次全体会议通过了建设湛江港的决定以来，经过一年零两个多月的时间，参加建港工程的全体职工已经完成了第一期工程工作量的70％，几项主要工程也已建成。在这期间，职工们不断地发挥了积极性和创造性，到9月中旬止，职工们一共提出了三千四百七十一件合理化建议，其中已经被采纳的有一千四百七十六件，此外还推广了三百八十一项建港的先进经验，根据不完全的统计，已经为国家节约了一百多万元，同时还创造了七万多元的价值。例如在安装龙门式起重机后锤的工程中，用废铁混凝土代替了铸铁，就为国家节约了九十六吨铸铁，约值一万四千多元。链斗式的挖泥船老工人李阿哥，创造了移主锚不停车的先进方法，每年可多挖泥一万六千八百立方公尺。
    一年多以来，在建港工程中涌现出二千八百七十六个模范功臣和先进生产者，有一百四十四个单位被评选为先进单位。很多民工和学徒最近已被提升为正式工人或技术工人。
