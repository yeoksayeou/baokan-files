Jiangsu Opens Western Medicine Studying Traditional Chinese Medicine Classes
Nearly Three Hundred Western Doctors Participate in Learning

(Our Newspaper News) Nearly three hundred Western doctors in Jiangsu Province have formally begun to systematically study Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) since September. The Western Medicine Studying TCM classes established by the Provincial Health Department in cities such as Nanjing, Suzhou, Nantong, Wuxi, Changzhou, Xuzhou, and Zhenjiang have all opened one after another. The content of the study classes includes four classic TCM works: "Essentials of the Inner Canon," "Treatise on Cold Damage," "Synopsis of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber," and "Shen Nong's Herbal Classic," as well as the history of TCM and professional knowledge of various TCM departments. The study period is three years.

The students in the study classes in various regions are all senior Western doctors who have graduated from universities or colleges and have considerable clinical experience. Among them are Gu Erhu, President of Subei Medical College, Liu Yangong, Professor of Jiangsu Medical College, and Chen Wangjishan, President of Suzhou First People's Hospital. Among the ninety-one students in the Nanjing class, thirty are Western doctors with the rank of attending physician or higher. The original plan was for two hundred and seventy students in the province's study classes, but because there were many applicants requesting to participate in the study, the number of student places was increased to two hundred and ninety-five.
