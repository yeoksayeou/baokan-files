Xinhua News Agency report by Bai Hao: The Oroqen people of the Oroqen Autonomous Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have begun to engage in diversified economic activities.

The Oroqen people have lived in the forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains for generations, engaging in single hunting production before liberation. At present, in addition to hunting, agricultural economies have emerged in the villages where some hunters have settled: various vegetables are planted near the residences; especially this year, in Nantun, Nuomin Nutuk (district), which settled earlier, more than 30 hectares of millet and barley were planted. Some hunters have participated in temporary forestry production, felling and transporting timber for construction departments. The Oroqen people in Nantun, Nuomin Nutuk, also have animal husbandry, with most hunters raising dairy cows, and some also raising chickens. Sideline production has also begun to diversify: in the past five or six years, the number of hunters picking tree ears has been increasing, and there are also productions such as transportation and making fur bedding for sale.

The emergence of diversified economies has increased the income of the Oroqen people. The more than 30 hectares of farmland planted in Nantun, Nuomin Nutuk, this year alone can solve most of the food and fodder problems for the entire village next year. From 1951 to August of this year, the income from picking tree ears alone in the entire banner reached more than 90,000 yuan.

The Oroqen people's start in diversified economic management is primarily due to the change from nomadic living to settlement, creating convenient conditions for engaging in agriculture and animal husbandry. Secondly, the government's assistance with new agricultural tools, livestock, etc., and the stipulation of reasonable purchase prices have encouraged their enthusiasm for engaging in diversified economic activities. Thirdly, the example of foreigners who came to their settlements increasing income and improving their lives in agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline industries has given them influence and technical assistance. Seeing the benefits of diversified economies, they gradually worked hard to learn. In addition, in recent years, some hunters have settled down and organized mutual aid and cooperative organizations, which has also promoted the division of labor in hunting, agriculture, and other productions.

    鄂伦春民族定居后的新发展
    由单一的狩猎生产发展为经营多种经济
    新华社讯　新华社记者白皓报道：内蒙古自治区鄂伦春自治旗的鄂伦春民族开始经营多种经济。
    鄂伦春人世居大兴安岭山林中，解放前从事单一的狩猎生产。目前，除了猎业生产外，在一部分猎人已经定居的各村落，出现了农业经济：在住宅附近种植了各种蔬菜；特别是今年，在定居较早的诺敏努图克（区）南屯，种了三十多公顷稷子和大麦。有一部分猎人参加了临时性的林业生产，为修建部门采伐和流送木材。诺敏努图克南屯的鄂伦春人还有了饲养业，大多数猎户养有奶牛，有的还养了小鸡。副业生产也开始多样化：最近五六年来，采木耳的猎民日益增多，还有搞运输、作皮被服出售等生产。
    多种经济的出现，使鄂伦春人增加了收入。仅诺敏努图克南屯今年种植的三十多公顷农田，即可解决明年全屯的大部分口粮和马料问题。从1951年到今年8月，全旗仅采木耳的收入即达九万多元。
    鄂伦春人开始经营多种经济，首先是由于改变游动居住为定居，创造了经营农业和饲养业的便利条件。其次，政府贷给新农具、牲畜等给以扶助、并规定合理的收购价格，鼓励了他们经营多种经济的热情。第三，外族来到他们的定居地后，在农业、饲养业和副业等方面增加收入提高生活的榜样，给了他们影响和技术上的帮助。他们看到多种经济的好处，就渐渐努力学习。此外，近年来，一部分猎民定居后，并组织了互助合作组织，也促进了猎农业等各种生产的分工。
