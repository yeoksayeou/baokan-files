　　A Production Team Leader Said to Me…
　　Zeng Yuqiu

　　"The villagers are thinking about many things!" Shi Zegong sat on the small stool opposite me, fanning himself with a large banana leaf fan.

　　He is an active production team leader in the Changtan Township Agricultural Cooperative of Fuan County, Fujian Province. Although he is in his fifties, he is as sturdy as a tree stump, and he speaks loudly, his voice filling the room.

　　"You want to ask why the villagers' morale is a bit off? ... Last year, we beat drums and gongs to establish the advanced cooperative. From November of last year, we worked month after month, working for seven months, doing more than twenty workdays a month. When the spring harvest came and the dividends were distributed, after the calculation, those who earned more only received thirty or forty yuan, and those who earned less received only ten or twenty yuan. The villagers aren't made of wood, they will naturally think: How come there's so little money left? A bamboo hat costs one jiao and two fen, and a broken hoe costs two yuan. How can such little money be enough to cover expenses? Once they think about it, their hands and feet feel a bit weak...."

　　He raised his hand and wiped his mouth: "Recently, the cooperative carried a few loads of grain out and sold it for one hundred and eighty yuan. Those in difficulty all received a little, which can be considered to have solved some pressing problems."

　　"Production can't focus on just one thing!" He pointed to the wall, where a row of hoes hung neatly. "Farmers use more than one hoe! After using this one, they use that one. Production can't be a one-sided effort! Not to mention anything else, in the past, after the soybeans were harvested, every household had some beans. Now, the women want to make some soybean paste, but there are no beans. Relatives and friends from the countryside come and go, and they can't even have a handful of fried soybeans. How can the women not grumble behind their backs?"

　　"As the head of the household, you have to think of everything carefully, even the small things. You have to think not only about the cooperative's convenience but also about the villagers' convenience. Take the private plots, for example! The cooperative is afraid of leaving good land for the villagers, so the villagers all go to work on the private plots. Therefore, they must leave distant land and bad land. The cooperative's work is also tight, and the villagers can't grow four hands, so they have no choice but not to cultivate the private plots. The private plots are abandoned, the villagers can't eat vegetables, and there are more opinions...."

　　"Naturally!" he said slowly: "The villagers' demands are sometimes right and sometimes wrong. Things they don't understand should be explained clearly; if you hit them with a stick right away, of course, you'll leave them bewildered!"

　　"If you're talking about the villagers not having any pocket money to spend, and having difficulty buying oil and salt, the root of this problem goes back to this spring. The cadres only thought about opening more wasteland and expanding the double-cropping rice area, wanting to be reported and praised, and didn't think about leaving any time for sideline occupations. During the busy spring plowing season, they wanted to open up wasteland, and they wanted to expand the single-cropping to double-cropping tenfold. One laborer had to be responsible for eight mu, nine mu, even twelve mu. This squeezed out all sideline occupations. – The boats on the river stopped moving, the brick kilns stopped smoking, and there were fewer chickens crowing and geese honking at home."

　　"After spending so much effort, we opened up one hundred and seventy mu of wasteland, but because there wasn't enough labor, most of it was left there, and we couldn't plant sweet potatoes, so it became wasteland again. It's good to be diligent, but you also need to have a plan!"

　　He made a summary of these matters, saying: "If you want the villagers to work nimbly, you must first open your eyes wider. Don't tie the villagers' hands and feet so tightly that they don't even have time for household sideline occupations."

　　Then, I asked him: Why are there so many opinions about changing single-cropping to double-cropping this year? – These days, under the banyan trees by the river, discussions are rife, like buzzing bees.

　　He pondered for a moment, his brow furrowed, then relaxed, becoming quiet, as if thinking about something. I could hear the long cicada songs outside, and the shadows of the leaves trembled slightly in the window.

　　He said that this year, the village suddenly expanded the double-cropping rice area tenfold, and some of it was not suitable for the soil. Last year, the village had more than three hundred mu of soybean fields, but this year it was squeezed down to only fifty mu. One mu of soybeans brings in more income than one mu of double-cropping rice, equivalent to two hundred jin of grain. Of the more than four hundred and ninety mu of double-cropping rice that the whole village changed to, more than one hundred mu did not yield a harvest.

　　"Of course! It's true that more than one hundred mu didn't yield a harvest because it was so dry for so many days. But there are also problems with the work! First, the water conservancy conditions are not good, and double-cropping rice is not as drought-resistant as single-cropping rice; second, the seeds are also wrong, the soil is not suitable, the seedling age is too long, and the planting season is too late. Originally, it would have been more worthwhile to change less this year. But at that time, you had no choice! 'Guarantees' were required at every level, so they were forced at every level...."

　　"When mobilizing the change from single-cropping to double-cropping, it was as if an ant nest had been overturned. Even at midnight, the cadres were still arguing, urging and quarreling everywhere, creating a chaotic mess, and heavily pressing down the task. At that time, some people said: The season is late, let's plant less! But they wouldn't, they wouldn't even listen, they wouldn't pay attention, as if everyone had forgotten the season. Even if the seedlings had already jointed, they would still make you carry three or four loads and plant them. Of course, some strange things will happen. After only a few days of planting, the rice will sprout. The farmers can't help but discuss: It's like a three-year-old girl, still sucking on her mother's nipple, and her belly is already big."

　　Speaking of Minister Wang of the County Party Committee's Cooperative Department, who led the change from single-cropping to double-cropping, Shi Zegong fanned himself vigorously, his voice so loud that it filled the entire room: "Minister Wang came here and didn't discuss a single word with us. He walked in and out with his head held high. Walking on the street, he didn't even look at anyone. He only looked for cooperative cadres. The cooperative cadres then forced the production team leaders, the production team leaders forced us, and we had no choice but to force the villagers. One forced the other, and that's how the 'production plan' was set!"

　　Zegong tapped his tobacco pipe loudly: "I've been farming for more than fifty years since I was a young boy, and I'm also the cooperative's technician, why didn't you discuss a half a word with me? … Planting too densely, there's not enough fertilizer, and the land doesn't have enough strength! … Why not be more humble when talking to old people? It's not like I don't believe in science, just explain the reasoning to me clearly, what's wrong with that? As long as you discuss it with us, wouldn't I pour out everything I have in my belly? The land has all been handed over to the cooperative, how can I not care about production?" He pointed with his fan, his voice getting louder and louder: "They just wouldn't, but they had to say it was scientific research, saying I was too conservative, and wanting to remove me from my position. Then I'll just let you go ahead! Whatever, I'll just hand everything over to you, it's none of my business!"

　　He raised his head and blew out a mouthful of white smoke, as if releasing all the pent-up anger in his belly.

　　"Cadres are the heads of the household, bearing such a heavy burden, they should always understand the situation when they encounter things, and not put on a cadre's airs. As the farmers say: 'All the hardship is for the belly.' If everything is handed over to the cooperative, who wouldn't be willing to work? If the cadres' eyes are on their foreheads, people won't want to find you. If there's no oil to light the lamp and no oil and salt to eat, hands and feet will become heavy. If everyone has enough to eat and use, hands and feet will become light."

　　I wanted to go with him to the fields to take a look. He stood up abruptly, took down a hoe, grabbed a bamboo hat, and went out with me.

　　Outside, there was a wave of fiery, oppressive sunlight, and a burst of the fragrance of rice. Everywhere there were green and yellow rice fields with varying shades.

　　In the midst of the green, there were a few patches of black soil. Zegong said: "These are all fields near the house, the very best land. When the farm work gets busy, they're left uncultivated."

　　Coming to the edge of another field, several plots looked as if they were overgrown with weeds, and there seemed to be rice seedlings there. Zegong kicked the seedlings with his foot, and a sigh escaped from deep within his chest: "Look, can this still be harvested?" The seedlings were all straight like arrows, not drooping their heads at all. He then used his hoe to pry them open, revealing a few short seedlings. "Look! Can this still be harvested?" He pulled out a rice spike for me to see, it was light and not substantial at all.

　　On one side, the rice field was lush and green, that was single-cropping rice. On the other side, it was dry and withered, light and flimsy, with only a few seedlings sprouting up. Those single-cropping late rice fields were indeed better. The fields without water were scorched dry. He said softly with heartache: "After working for two years in one, making the fields so good, but insisted on mobilizing the change from single-cropping to double-cropping, planted too late, without water to nourish them, there will be no rice to harvest!" His chest rose and fell, breathing heavily.

　　He squatted by the field, put his ear to my ear, and said: "Farmers work for a year, it's not easy to harvest some rice! Doesn't your heart ache to see this scene!" The villagers in the cooperative have their hands and feet tied tightly, and agriculture and sideline occupations must both be done well, so that the blood can flow smoothly. Like this, it won't work."

　　His eyes were filled with joy when he looked at the green, bright rice that pleased the eye; but when he looked at the dry fields, he couldn't help but be filled with sorrow: "Why is the leadership like this? Why?"

    一个生产队长对我说…………
    曾毓秋
    “社员们想的事情多得很！”施则恭坐在我对面的小凳子上，手里扑打着一把大芭蕉扇。
    他是福建省福安县长潭乡农业社的一个积极的生产队长，五十好几岁了，却还像个树桩似地精壮，说话也很响亮，声音灌满了屋子。
    “你要问，社员情绪为什么有些不对头么？……去年打锣打鼓，办了高级社。从去年11月起，一个月一个月干，干了七个月，一个月作了上二十个工。等到春收分红，算盘一响，收入多的人才分到三、四十元，少的不过分一、二十元。社员们不是木头，心里当然会想：怎么才剩这么点钱？一顶斗笠还要一角二分，一把锄头坏了，也要两元。这么点钱，怎么够开销？一想，手脚就有点酸了……。”
    他举起手来，抹了抹嘴巴：“最近社里担了几担谷子出去，卖了一百八十元。有困难的，大家都支了一点，算是解决了一些为难的地方。”
    “生产那能单抓一项啊！”他向墙上一指，那儿整整齐齐的挂着一排锄头。“农民用的锄头也不止一把啊！用了这一把，再用那一把。生产那能单打一呢？旁的不说，往年黄豆收下来，家家户户都有点豆子。现在，妇女们要作点豆酱了，却没有豆子。乡里的亲戚，人来客往的，连吃一把炒豆子都不行。妇女们怎么不在背后叽咕呢？”
    “当家人，诸事都要想得周到，那怕是小地方。不光要想到社里方便，也要想到社员方便。像自留地吧！社里生怕给社员留下好地，社员都去搞自留地去了。因此，一定要留远地，留坏地。社里工又紧，社员长不出四只手来，只好不去种自留地。自留地荒了，社员们吃不上菜，意见也多起来了。……”
    “自然嘛！”他慢悠悠地说：“社员们的要求，也有对的，也有不对的。他们不清楚的，要好好地讲明白；你迎头就一棍，当然就把他们打闷了！”
    “要是说起社员们没零钱花，买油买盐都为难，这条根还要从今年春上说起。干部们只想开的荒地多，扩大的双季稻多，要通报，要表扬，就没想到为副业留下点时间。春耕大忙时，又要开荒，单季改双季又要扩大十倍。一个劳动力要负担八亩、九亩、十二亩都有。这就把副业挤得光光的。——河上船只不动了，瓦窑不冒烟了，家里鸡叫鹅吵也少了。”
    “费了那么大的劲，开了一百七十亩荒地，因为劳力不够用，大部分都丢在那里，插不上甘薯，又变成了荒地。抓得紧是好，可是也要有个盘算才行哪！”
    他对这些事情作了个总结说：“你要叫社员手脚轻快，先要把眼睛放大些才行。不要把社员手脚绑那么紧，搞家庭副业的时间都不留。”
    接着，我问他：为什么今年对单季改双季的意见那么多？——这几天里，河边榕荫树下，议论纷纭，像营营嗡嗡的蜜蜂一样。
    他沉思了一下，眉头打了个结，又放开了，静了下来，仿佛在想着什么。听得见外边悠长的蝉鸣，树叶的影子微微在窗口颤动。
    他说，这个村今年双季稻一下子就扩大了十倍，这里头有好些是地土不合的。去年村里有三百多亩豆田，今年挤得只有五十来亩。一亩豆子比种一亩双季稻，多收入的钱，可折合两百斤谷子。全村四百九十多亩改种的双季稻，有一百多亩都没有收成。
    “当然啰！有一百来亩都没有收，固然是因为旱了那么多天。可是，工作上也有毛病哪！一来是水利条件不好，双季稻就不如单季稻耐旱一些；二来，也是种籽不对，地土不合，秧龄又太长了，种的季节又迟。本来，今年少改些更合算。可是，当时由不得你嘛！要层层‘保证’，就层层强迫。……”
    “在动员单季改双季的时候，好似打翻了蚂蚁窝一样。半夜了，干部们还在吵闹，到处催逼、争吵，闹做一团，重重地把任务压了下去。当时，也有人说：季节迟了，少插点吧！但是，他们不，连听也不听，理也不理，好似每个人都忘了季节一样。有的秧已经拔节了，也要你担三、四担插下去。这当然会出些新鲜事。才插几天，稻子就会出穗了。农民忍不住议论：像三岁的女孩子，嘴巴还含着奶头，肚子就大了。”
    提起领导单季改双季的县委合作部王部长，施则恭把扇子扇的扑扑响，声音又大得灌满了整个屋子：“王部长来这里，就没有同我们商量过一句。头昂昂地走进走出。走在街上，看也不看一眼。他光是找社干部。社干部又迫生产大队长，生产大队长迫我们，我们只好迫社员。一个硬迫一个，这样把‘生产计划’定成了！”
    则恭把烟筒打得拍拍响：“从我头上缚红头绳起，作田也作了五十来年了，又是社里的技术员，为什么不和我商量个一句半句呢？……插得太密了，肥料不够，田的气力也不够呀！……同老人家说话，为什么不谦虚点？我又不是不信科学，就把道理跟我讲清楚些，又有什么不好呢？只要同我们商量商量，我还有不把肚子里的货色都倒出来的吗？土地都交给社里了，那还有不关心生产的呢？”他把扇子指指点点，声音越说越高：“他们偏不，却要说是科学研究下来的，说我太保守，要撤我的职。那我就随你去吧！横也好，竖也好，我只要把事情都交给你们就算了，反正不与我相干！”
    他昂起头来，笔直地喷了一口白烟，好似把肚子闷气都喷了出来。
    “干部，是当家人，担着那么重的担子，总要遇事体谅下情才好，不要摆起一个干部架子。农民说得好：‘千苦万苦，为了肚子。’把什么都交在社里了，谁还不愿干呢？要是干部的眼睛放在额头上，人家就不愿去找你了。灯油没得点，油盐没得吃，手脚就都重了。大家有得吃，有得用，手脚就变轻了。”
    我要同他一道到田野上去看看。他霍地站起，拿下一把锄头，又拿了一顶斗笠，就同我出门了。
    外边是一阵火样迫人的阳光，扑过来一阵稻子的清香。到处是绿色黄色深浅交错的稻田。
    在遍地绿色里，有几块土地是黑色的。则恭说：“这都是屋边田，顶顶好的土地。农活一忙，就丢荒了。”
    再来到一块田边，几丘田像长满了荒草似的，那里像是秧苗。则恭用脚踢踢禾苗，从胸膛深处冒出一声叹息：“你看，这还有收吗？”禾苗都是笔直得像箭似的，一点也没有垂下头来。他再用锄头拨开，露出了几根矮矮的秧苗。“你看！这还会有收吗？”他拔了根稻穗给我看，轻飘飘的，一点也不实在。
    一边稻田是青油油的，那是单季稻。一边却是枯干的，轻飘飘的，只抽了几根苗上来。那些单季晚稻田，确实比较好些。没有水的田，就是焦干的。他痛心地轻声说：“一年作了两年工，田作的这么好，偏偏硬要动员单季改双季，插的又迟，没有水养，就没有稻子割了！”他的胸膛起起伏伏，在沉重地呼吸。
    他蹲在田边，凑着我的耳朵说：“农民作了一年工，割点稻子不容易啊！看到这个光景心痛不心痛！”社里社员手脚都绑得紧紧的，农业、副业都干得好，血脉也才疏通。像这样，就不行了。”
    他的眼睛望着青青的亮人眼睛的稻子，就充满欢喜；望着那些干枯的田，又禁不住充满忧愁：“为什么要这样领导呢？为什么呢？”
