Xinhua News Agency, October 21st. A. Ayyangar, head of the Indian Republic's Parliamentary Delegation, held a banquet this afternoon to bid farewell to his Chinese hosts before his departure from Beijing.

Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Premier Zhou Enlai attended the banquet.

In his speech at the banquet, Head of Delegation Ayyangar said:

"During our three weeks in China, we did not feel that we were in a foreign country. We felt the natural affinity between two great peoples." He pointed out, "In many things, we are the same."

Speaker A. Ayyangar said: "Now that we are free nations, we have a responsibility to bring this freedom to other countries, large and small, that are still suffering under colonial rule. As long as one country is still subjugated to or dominated by another, true world peace is impossible. We must work together to eliminate colonialism from the earth by peaceful means."

A. Ayyangar pointed out that all of humanity's energies must be used to serve people, not to destroy them. Therefore, a new type of person must emerge, warriors for peace, not warriors for war. He said, "We are extremely pleased to see that this new type of person is growing rapidly in your country, as it is in ours."

He praised China's construction achievements and expressed gratitude to people from all walks of life in China for their warm hospitality to the delegation. He pointed out that both our countries are engaged in great construction, and we have much to learn from each other. He said: "We can happily assure you that we will take back with us the knowledge of your experiences and your efforts in all aspects, which we hope will be of great benefit to us."

Chairman Liu Shaoqi also pointed out in his speech that China and India need to help each other and learn from each other. He said, "We deeply admire the spirit of thorough investigation of problems displayed by all friends during their visit to our country, and we are very grateful for the many valuable suggestions made. I believe that some of China's experiences can be used for your reference, and India's many strengths are worthy of our learning. Mr. Head of Delegation has repeatedly expressed his desire for me to visit India. I myself am very happy to see your country and learn from your experience."

Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that the friendship between the one billion people of China and India is a great friendship, and the strength of the one billion people of China and India is a great strength. Further unity and cooperation between us will make great contributions to national construction and world peace. We cherish this friendship very much.

During the banquet, the hosts and guests repeatedly stood up to toast the health of the national leaders and workers of China and India, to the friendship between the two countries and "Panchsheel" (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence), to the cause of world peace, and to the happiness of women and children in both countries.

Present at the banquet this afternoon were Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Peng Zhen, Chen Shutong, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and some members, Zhang Bojun, Bao Erhan, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and some standing committee members and members, Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and responsible persons from other relevant government departments, Ding Xilin, President of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, responsible persons of various people's organizations, and well-known figures from all walks of life in Beijing.

Indian Ambassador to China R.K. Nehru and his wife also attended the banquet.

At the banquet, the delegation presented valuable gifts to the Chinese national leaders and workers.

    印度国会代表团团长举行辞别宴会
    新华社21日讯　印度共和国国会代表团团长阿·阿延加尔，在行将离开北京之前于今日下午举行宴会向中国的主人辞别。
    刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理出席了宴会。
    阿延加尔团长在会上讲话说：
  “我们在中国的三个星期的期间内，没有感到我们是在陌生的国家。我们感到两个伟大人民之间的自然的亲切。”他指出，“在很多事情上我们是一样。”
    阿·阿延加尔议长说：“现在我们已经是获得自由的国家，有责任将这个自由带给仍在殖民统治下遭受苦难的其他大小国家。只要有一个国家还屈服于另一个国家，或受另一个国家的支配，真正的世界和平就是不可能的。我们要共同努力，用和平的办法把殖民主义从地球上消灭。”
    阿·阿延加尔指出，人类的一切精力必须使用于为人的服务，而不是为了毁灭人。因此，必须产生一种新型的人，他们是为和平的战士，而不是战争的战士。他说：“我们极其高兴地看到，这样新型的人，正在贵国和我国一样迅速地成长着。”
    他盛赞了中国的建设成就，并且对中国各界人士对代表团的热情招待表示感谢。他指出，我们两国都在进行着伟大的建设，我们有许多事都需互相学习。他说：“我们可以欣慰地告慰诸位，我们此次回国将带回去关于你们的经验和你们在各方面的努力的知识，希望这对我们将有很大的益处。”
    刘少奇委员长在会上讲话，也指出中印两国需要互相帮助，互相学习。他说：“各位朋友在访问我国期间深入研究问题的精神，我们十分钦佩，提出许多宝贵的意见，我们十分感谢。我认为中国的某些经验可供你们参考，印度的许多长处，值得我们学习。团长先生一再表示要我到印度进行访问，我本人是很欢迎看看你们的国家，学习你们的经验的。”
    刘少奇委员长说，中印两国十亿人民的友谊是伟大的友谊，中印两国十亿人民的力量是伟大的力量，我们进一步团结合作起来，对国家的建设和世界的和平都会作出伟大的贡献。我们十分珍重这种友谊。
    席间，宾主频频起立，互为中印两国的国家领导工作人员的健康，为两国的友谊和“潘查希拉”，为世界的和平事业，为两国妇女儿童的幸福而干杯。
