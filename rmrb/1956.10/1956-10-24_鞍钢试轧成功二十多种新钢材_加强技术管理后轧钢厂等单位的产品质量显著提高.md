Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, October 22nd: Square seamless steel pipes, which China had never produced before, have been successfully trial-manufactured at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Seamless Steel Tube Plant. Using this type of steel pipe to make supports for mine tunnels is very strong and durable, and can better ensure the safety of miners.

Square seamless steel pipes are one of the more than twenty new products that Anshan Iron and Steel has successfully trial-produced in the past two months. Since September, the company has successfully rolled new products such as No. 16 and 17 steel window frames, mixed steel ropes, high-quality medium plates, rivet round steel, alloy seamless steel pipes, and low-alloy herringbone steel.

The reason for the improvement in new product trial production work is mainly because the company's various business departments and factories have changed the past situation of blaming each other and shirking responsibilities, and have achieved mutual cooperation and mutual supervision, and carried out trial production according to the scheduled trial production plan. For example, when square seamless steel pipes were recently trial-produced, the Large Rolling Mill had not sent the square tube billets to the Seamless Steel Tube Plant by the day before the trial production period. Therefore, the Technical Department and the Production Department and other units sent people to the Large Rolling Mill to check and find ways to immediately send the tube billets to the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, so that this new product was trial-produced on time.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, October 20th: The quality of steel produced by Anshan Iron and Steel has significantly improved in the month and a half from the beginning of September to the present. In September, the first-grade product indicators of each factory all exceeded the national regulations. In the first half of October, the quality of major steel products continued to improve gradually.

Since the beginning of September, various rolling mills have strengthened technical management work. The Large Rolling Mill held several employee symposiums to analyze the reasons for poor quality, and adopted measures such as strictly selecting raw materials, modifying hole patterns, and auxiliary equipment, so that the quality of steel increased from 88.9% to 92.4%, and the first-grade rate of heavy rails reached 91.5%. In the first half of October, the quality of heavy rails was even better, with first-grade products reaching 92.9%.

The Steel Rope Factory, which had failed to meet quality targets for eight months, has also improved. After implementing the suggestions for improving steel wire heat treatment put forward by Soviet experts since September, the quality of steel ropes increased to 98.5%, which is 7% higher than the average quality target last year.

The Medium Plate Factory reduced the waiting time for steel billets in the heating furnace, thus eliminating pitting on steel plates, and the first-grade rate reached 98%, creating a new record for the highest quality.

### 鞍钢试轧成功二十多种新钢材  加强技术管理后轧钢厂等单位的产品质量显著提高

    鞍钢试轧成功二十多种新钢材
    加强技术管理后轧钢厂等单位的产品质量显著提高
    新华社鞍山22日电　我国过去从未生产过的方型无缝钢管，已在鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂试制成功。用这种钢管制作矿山坑道的支柱，非常牢固耐用，可以更好地保证矿工的安全。
    方型无缝钢管是鞍钢近两个月来试制成功的二十多种新产品中的一种。这个公司从9月份以来轧制成功的新产品，还有十六、十七号钢窗框、混合钢绳、优质中板、铆钉元钢、合金无缝钢管和低合金人字纹钢等。
    新产品试制工作得到改进的原因，主要是由于这个公司的各业务处和各厂矿之间改变了过去互相埋怨推诿责任的情况，做到共同协作，互相监督，按照排定的试制计划进行试制。例如，最近试制方型无缝钢管时，到了试制期的前一天，大型轧钢厂还没有把方型管坯送到无缝钢管厂去，于是技术处和生产处等单位就派人到大型轧钢厂进行检查，设法立即把管坯送到无缝钢管厂，使这种新产品按时试制出来。
    新华社鞍山20日电　鞍钢的钢材质量从9月开始到现在的一个半月中有了显著提高。9月份，各厂的一级品指标全部超过国家的规定。10月上半月主要钢材的质量还在逐步提高。
    9月开始，各轧钢厂加强了技术管理工作。大型轧钢厂曾经召开过几次职工座谈会，分析质量低劣的原因，并且采取了严格挑选原料、修改孔型和附属设备等措施，使钢材质量由88.9％提高到92.4％，重轨一级品率达到91.5％。10月上半月重轨质量更好了，一级品达到92.9％。
    八个月没有完成质量指标的钢绳厂也好转了。9月开始贯彻了苏联专家提出的改进钢线热处理等建议后，使钢绳质量提高到98.5％，比去年平均质量指标提高了7％。
    中板厂减少了钢坯在加热炉内待轧时间，因而消灭了钢板的麻点，一级品率达到98％，创造了质量最高新纪录。
