Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 24th: The work of sinking caissons and drilling holes from the caissons into the bedrock of the riverbed for each pier of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was completely finished on the 23rd; the work of pouring concrete into the caissons and drill holes has also been largely completed. These circumstances indicate that the pier foundation engineering, which is of decisive significance for the construction of this bridge, has been basically completed.

This pier foundation project took only a little over a year from full-scale commencement to basic completion. Such a speed is a first in the history of bridge construction in our country. This is because the workers successfully utilized a new pier foundation construction method – the "large caisson drilling method," which enabled the simultaneous and widespread development of work on each pier, and was not restricted by floods, allowing year-round construction. According to preliminary estimates, the cost of pier foundations constructed using this method is more than 6 million yuan less than that of the "pneumatic caisson method" popular in the world. At the same time, it is also superior in terms of improving foundation quality and improving the safety of workers' operations.

Due to the rapid completion and good quality of the pier foundation engineering, the realization of the task of opening the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge to traffic more than a year ahead of the national plan has now laid a reliable foundation.

    为提前一年通车打下基础
    长江大桥完成桥墩基础工程
    据新华社武汉24日电　武汉长江大桥各桥墩下沉管柱和从管柱内向江底岩盘钻孔的工作，在23日全部结束；在管柱和钻孔内灌注混凝土的工作也大部完成。这些情况表明：修建这座大桥具有决定意义的桥墩基础工程，已经基本完成了。
    这项桥墩基础工程从全面开工到基本完成仅用了一年零一个多月的时间。这样的速度在我国桥梁建筑史上是第一次。这是由于职工们成功地运用了新的桥墩基础施工方法——“大型管柱钻孔法”，使各桥墩能够同时广泛地展开工作，并且不受洪水的限制，常年施工。据初步核算，用这个方法修筑的桥墩基础，比用世界上流行的“压气沉箱法”要节约造价六百多万元。同时，在提高基础质量和改善工人的安全操作方面，也比较优越。
    由于桥墩基础工程的尽快完成和质量良好，武汉长江大桥按照国家计划提前一年多建成通车的任务的实现，现在已经打下了可靠的基础。
