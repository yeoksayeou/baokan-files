    “Fist Coasts”
    Qin Mu
    Opening an African map, some place names on it are quite striking, namely the Gold Coast, the Ivory Coast, the Diamond Coast, and so on.

    The naming of these places is not very old; it mostly occurred during the “youth” of imperialism. Seeing these place names, we easily recall scenes from old American movies: a European or American wearing a shirt and shorts, a pith helmet, and holding a whip or a pistol, arrogantly supervising as groups of African natives heave and haul boxes.

    These boxes are filled with things like gold, ivory, and diamonds. In the eyes of those colonialists, what these places were originally called, what ethnic groups originally lived there, what characteristics they originally had, didn't matter. What mattered was what I could seize here, and that's what I'd call the coast. The imperialists of their youth were very straightforward; back then, they didn't bother putting on a civilized act and quoting scriptures and talking about God, civilization, justice, and such.

    But a hundred years have passed, and imperialism has aged. The portrait of the pirate, reverently printed on cigarette boxes popular in half the world, may still look formidable, but the beards of their descendants have indeed grown longer, and their fists and feet are far inferior to those of their grandfathers. From Asia to Africa, many coasts that were once seen as sources of wealth to be taken at will have raised their fists and become "Fist Coasts." The coast of China, the coast of Korea, the coast of Vietnam, the coast of Malaya... and even the various coasts of Africa, are all becoming like this.

    The nations that have been oppressed have deeply understood that their iron fists can repel the snouts of pigs that have broken into the gardens of their motherland.

    Without such fists, the entire country could be dug up and carted away, and neither the dead nor the living would be at peace. In America, didn't someone try to transport Egyptian mummies away? In America, aren't black and red people, exploited to the point of destitution, organized by capitalists to race against kangaroos and swim against crocodiles?

    Oppressed nations have deeply understood this, and now they are neither afraid of guns and cannons nor fooled by sweet talk.

    For imperialists, just as many other places have become "Fist Coasts," Egypt, which has always been regarded as a "Canal Coast," is now roaring and has also become a "Fist Coast." This standing-up nation not only has the entire Arab nation behind it, but also the people of the whole world. If the imperialists want to act, they should carefully examine the people's fists and also consider their own beards. Courage belongs only to righteous heroes, and never to greedy mercenaries. Imperialists should remember this story: once, on the battlefield in Vietnam, a French soldier and a Vietnamese fighter fought over a hand grenade that had already been armed. The struggle was fierce, but when the grenade became hot and was about to explode, it was ultimately the French mercenary who withdrew his hand, resulting in himself and the bunker he was hiding in being destroyed.

    Perhaps the imperialists already vaguely feel their fate. These days, their crazy rhetoric and despicable methods on the Suez Canal issue, that kind of ugly behavior, has truly shocked the world.

    Imperialist gentlemen often accuse others of not believing in God, which is truly one of the most humorous things on this earth. You people with bloodstained hands, please listen to the voice of that great humanitarian, Jesus: "Ye cannot serve God and Mammon!" "Put your sword back in its place, for all who draw the sword will die by the sword."

### “拳头海岸”

    “拳头海岸”
    秦牧
    翻开非洲的地图，那上面有一些地名是相当触目的，那就是黄金海岸、象牙海岸、钻石海岸等等。
    这些地方，命名的时间并不很长久，那大抵是在帝国主义的“青春时代”获得的。一看到这些地名，我们很容易想起从前看到的美国电影里的一些镜头：一个穿着衬衫短裤，头戴通帽，手里拿着鞭子或手枪的欧美人，意气骄横地在督工，成群的非洲土人呀嗬呀嗬地搬运着箱子的情景。
    这些箱子，装的就是黄金、象牙、钻石之类的东西了。在那些殖民主义者看来，这些地方本来叫什么名字，本来住着什么民族，本来有什么特点，都不要紧，我能够在这里夺取到什么，我就把它叫做什么海岸。青春时代的帝国主义者，倒是很直爽的，那时他们还不大装出个斯文样子在那里引经据典地谈什么上帝、文明、正义之类的字眼。
    然而一百年过去了，帝国主义衰老了。被尊崇地印在流行于半个世界的香烟盒子上的海盗的肖像虽然还是威风凛凛的样子，然而他们的子孙的胡子的确已经长了，拳脚已经大大不如祖父了。从亚洲到非洲，许多被目为可以予取予夺地得到财富的海岸，一处处都伸出了拳头来，变成了“拳头海岸”。中国的海岸，朝鲜的海岸，越南的海岸，马来亚的海岸……以至于非洲的各个海岸，都纷纷变成这个样子了。
    曾经被压迫过的民族，已经深深地知道：用自己的铁拳是可以击退窜进自己祖国花园里的猪嘴的。
    如果不用这样的拳头，就是整个国土让人铲起运走，死人和活人也仍然不得安生的。在美国，不是有人企图运走埃及的木乃伊么？在美国，被剥削到陷入赤贫的黑人和红人，不是被资本家们组织去和袋鼠竞跑，和鳄鱼竞泳么？
    被压迫民族深深地领略了这一套，大家现在既不怕枪炮，也不迷惑于花言巧语了。
    对于帝国主义者来说，像其他的许多地方纷纷变成“拳头海岸”一样，一向被当做是“运河海岸”的埃及，已经在怒吼，也变成了一个“拳头海岸”了。这个屹立起来的国家，背后不但站着整个阿拉伯民族，也还站着全世界的人民。帝国主义者想动手，应该好好审视一下人家的拳头，也思量一下自己的胡子。勇气这种东西，只属于正义的英雄，决不属于贪婪的雇佣兵。帝国主义者应该记住这样一个故事：从前在越南战场上，一个法国兵和一个越南战士争夺已经拉了线的一颗手榴弹，争夺是很剧烈的，但是当手榴弹发热快要爆炸的时候，把手缩回去而终于使自己和藏身的堡垒被炸毁的，终究是法兰西的雇佣兵。
    也许帝国主义者已经隐约感到自己的命运罢。这些日子来他们在苏伊士运河问题上所表现的疯狂言论和卑鄙手段，那种丑态真是使全世界都吃惊了。
    帝国主义绅士们常常在指责别人不信上帝，这真是我们居住的地球上最幽默的事情之一。你们这些手染鲜血的人们，就请听听那个伟大的人道主义者耶稣的声音吧：“你们不能既奉侍上帝，又奉侍玛门（财神）！”“放刀入鞘吧，凡动刀的，必死于刀下。”
