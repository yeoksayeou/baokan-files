I luxuriated in the passionate embrace of the Black Sea's waves and the ardent kisses of the sun on the beach. My spirit felt incredibly light and happy. Therefore, as we departed from the seaside of Eforie, Mangalia, Constanta, and other places, a deep sense of attachment welled up in my heart, and beautiful, poetic impressions from the past few days constantly floated into my mind. It wasn't until our travelling car sped along the somewhat uneven country road, and our companion softly told us that we had entered the "Negru Vodă" district, that my thoughts began to be drawn to the new life about to be encountered, turning back from the whirlpool of memories.

	The "Negru Vodă" district is truly a temptingly named place. As a guest from China, I am already quite familiar with it. From the moment I first saw, on a chart at the Romanian People's Republic Agricultural Achievement Exhibition in Bucharest, a small red flag marking the complete collectivization of agriculture in this district, I developed an extremely close feeling towards it. Now, it is displayed before us. We first saw its bountiful harvest: groups of harvesters, convoys of trucks, strong cattle and horses, covering the vast expanse of golden wheat fields. The red headscarves and colorful dresses of the female villagers swayed in the wind like flowers.

	We stopped in a village called Gobadin. Although this wide, tree-filled village mostly consisted of rows of neat new houses, and the vicinity of the township government already possessed the appearance of a small town, the old cattle resting under the shade of the trees, the crowing of chickens heard everywhere, the flocks of geese and ducks in the streets, the dust-raising horse-drawn carriages, the sparse few old thatched cottages, the barefoot children climbing trees or using sticks to knock down apricots, the women leaning against the low fences, smiling and waving to us..., all of this made me feel exceptionally close. I felt as if I had walked into the Chinese countryside where I grew up and worked for a long time.

	From the sincere people here, we learned that 78% of the farmers in the entire township had joined collective farms, and 20% had joined cooperative farming societies. The land of the collective farms and cooperative farming societies can be cultivated by tractor stations on their behalf, or partially weeded, fertilized, and harvested. Members of the collective farm can earn an average of 300 workdays per year, and good workers can earn 500; even women can earn at least 150. (The income for each workday, excluding by-products such as honey, milk, and fruit, is already about 30 lei in grain income alone). These figures, symbolizing the happy and prosperous life of farmers walking the socialist road, made us even more excited. We made a request that was too much trouble for the hosts, wanting to stay in a farmer's home for a few days. As soon as this request was made, it immediately received the enthusiastic help of the township cadres and the welcome of the farmers. That very noon, I was taken into the home of an old man named Mihai, who managed a cooperative warehouse in the district government.

	When I followed Grandpa Mihai into his house, the three or four women who were doing various housework chores in the outer room, upon seeing me, a female guest from China, without waiting for Mihai to introduce me, all put aside their weaving shuttles, wool-spinning spindles, lace-knitting crochet needles, etc., and stood up to greet me. Among them was a short, thin old woman with wrinkles piled between her brows, wearing a plain-colored dress tied with a self-woven wool belt with patterned designs. She ran up and hugged me immediately, then used her large, rough hands, which had worked hard all her life, to pat the dust off my body. The peaceful and leisurely life and work order in the house was disrupted by me. One offered me a seat, another placed my luggage. Grandpa Mihai pointed to the door of the room on the left to the old woman, and the old woman immediately opened the door, and everyone signaled me to go in.

	The exceptionally clean, tidy, and beautiful furnishings in the room made my footsteps hesitate for a moment, as I was afraid that my dust-covered shoes would soil the flower carpet that covered the room. In that instant, the old woman had already brought a brush and personally cleaned my shoes. I was almost ushered into the inner room.

	I put down my handbag, composed myself, and in the harmonious light, everything in the room was more clearly reflected in my sight. The ceiling was decorated with patterns, the walls were hung with various colored woolen blankets, and the beds were arranged with large and small square and round pillows embroidered with various patterns; the high and low tables and stools were placed very appropriately, and each one was covered with a tablecloth or cushion with distinct national characteristics. On a small round table near the head of the bed, there was a bottle of fresh flowers, and next to the fresh flowers was a glass frame containing a half-length photo of a young man with thick eyebrows, big eyes, and a smiling face. On the surrounding walls, there were also scattered other photos of this young man and others.

	Grandpa Mihai began to introduce me. He first pulled the short old woman, standing shoulder to shoulder with him, and repeatedly called out: "Măria Mihai". I immediately understood that this was his old wife. Then he told me that they had three children. The old woman excitedly took down a frame hanging on the wall, which contained nine four-inch half-length portraits. The two old people pointed together to the young man with thick eyebrows and big eyes, saying that he was their eldest son, Dumitru Mihai. He had just returned from studying in the Soviet Union last year and is now an engineer in Constanța. This room is where he occasionally comes back to rest on holidays, and it is usually lived in by his two younger sisters. At this time, a girl standing next to me in a red patterned dress held out two fingers to tell me that she was the family's second daughter, named Biha, and worked at the "8th of May" collective farm with her older sister, Ilina.

	In the very center of the nine photos was a Chinese girl with a round face. Everyone told me in unison that this was Dumitru's classmate in Moscow. At this moment, I completely forgot that I was a guest ten thousand miles away, and felt as warm and close as when I went home from school or came to the old mama of the guerrillas when I was a child. Although language communication was still very difficult, there was not even a little distance between hearts. Everyone pointed to the photo and then pointed to me, as if to say: In the past, we only saw Chinese people in photos, and now someone has come to live in our house. They laughed with their mouths unable to close. The old woman warmly asked about my mother, father, children, and myself. The girls, as usual, were most concerned about love matters, and they meticulously wanted me to tell them about my lover and the situation of Chinese families. The two sisters, Biha and Ilina, scrambled to take out from the cupboard the more colorful woolen blankets, pillows, etc. that they had spun and woven themselves, which were all things made during the agricultural off-season and daily rest time in preparation for marriage. The light of happiness shone in the eyes and faces of the young girls. From them, I saw the freedom and love that the superior social system of the Romanian People's Republic brought to young men and women, especially women.

	I really can't say how happy I was: in Gobadin, I had a Romanian home, a Romanian old mama. In this way, I left early and returned late, and worked even harder. Every morning, as soon as I got out of bed, the old mama would hold a beautifully patterned ceramic jar and fill a small plate with honey that exuded a rich floral fragrance; then, she would send a small cup of hot coffee, and would watch me eat it, asking me if it was sweet and fragrant. When she saw me nodding repeatedly and saying it was very good, she smiled contentedly, her eyes narrowed into a slit.

	Every night, no matter what time I returned home, as soon as I opened the door, there would be a burst of loud laughter welcoming me. At this time, Grandpa Mihai had already gotten off work, and the two daughters had also returned from the fields. The old mama had prepared a delicious dinner for them. They clearly knew that I had already eaten in the township government cafeteria, but they always sat around the table, guarding a brightly polished kerosene lamp, waiting for me to return. So, I sat among them again, eating the dishes made by the old mama and drinking the beer cooled in the well with everyone. Grandpa, taking advantage of a little alcohol-induced excitement, talked about their life from bitterness to sweetness as if telling a story. In this way, I further learned the inside story of this poor farmer's family: he was originally a Macedonian from Romania. In the society ruled by landlords and the bourgeoisie, war caused them to be displaced, and he had worked as a hired hand on the estates of Bulgarian landlords for many years. After Romania's liberation, he returned to his motherland. The government distributed the land confiscated from the landlords to his family like it did to many landless peasants, giving them nine hectares. In 1950, as soon as the collective farm was established in the village, they were among the first to join.

	Sometimes, when the conversation went late into the night, the family would still be very interested in turning on the record player or radio and asking me to listen to music with them. How much they love the folk tunes of their motherland. With the rhythm of the music, the old mama's bare feet danced lightly on the carpet.

	"This record player was bought back by Dumitru from Moscow. Listen, how good the sound is: The radio is our own Romanian thing, it's also good! Now more than half of the four hundred and twenty households in our collective farm have bought these things..." Grandpa, like the chairman of the collective farm, wrote these numbers on my little notebook with a pencil, boasting about their happy life. The old mama also chimed in:

	"More than three hundred families have also built new houses like ours. We no longer live in mud sheds and thatched houses that can't keep out the wind and rain. We've also added clothes and furniture..."

	During the day, in the spare time of my visits, the old mama would take me alone to see some of the belongings she managed herself according to the regulations of the collective farm. She walked past the pigsty, adding a scoop of feed to her fat pigs; seeing the few big sheep, she reached out to touch them, as if grateful for their supply of wool for the family's use. A group of hens and chicks, seeing her pass by, chirped and cackled, all surrounding her. She took out a handful of grain from her apron pocket, scattered it on the ground, and then walked to the small vegetable garden planted with tomatoes, fennel, etc. She said to me with a hopeful expression: She also wants to save money to buy a dairy cow and learn to raise some silkworms to make life more prosperous.

	When I finished my visit and was about to leave Gobadin, I didn't dare tell the old mama this news too early. However, on the morning of the day I was leaving, Grandpa Mihai had already told the whole family this unpleasant news as soon as it dawned. No wonder Biha and Ilina didn't go to the commando team as early as usual. As soon as I got out of bed, everyone rushed up and hugged me, all expressing their reluctance to let me leave. It was Grandpa who reminded us that the car was already waiting for me at the door, and everyone quickly helped me pack my things. For the last time, I ate the old mama's honey and coffee, but I didn't dare to look directly at everyone's reluctant faces. Grandpa Mihai had already taken my luggage out the door, and the old mama still hugged me tightly, unwilling to let go. At this time, I saw her deep-set eyes filled with tears.

	The people in the yard and the neighbors were alarmed and came out to see me off. I shook hands with everyone over and over again, said goodbye countless times, but still couldn't bear to leave quickly. The car horn was calling nearby. Finally, I threw myself into the old mama's arms and called out in a hoarse voice: "Mama, goodbye!" I felt the old mama's trembling arms hugging me even tighter, and as her lips kissed my forehead for the last time, tears fell on my face.

	I had already gone far, and looking back, I still saw a sea of raised arms in front of the wooden gate. The short old mama stood at the very front, wiping her eyes while still waving goodbye to me.
	Sent from Romania

    我有了一位罗马尼亚的老妈妈
    ——罗马尼亚散记　 
    曾克
    我们尽情地享受了黑海的浪花的激情拥抱和沙滩上阳光的热烈亲吻。我的精神感到十分轻松和愉快。因此，当我们离开了艾弗里耶、洛以达、康斯坦萨等地的海滨的时候，我的心里生起了深深的依恋，脑际不断浮现起几天来留下的美丽的、充满诗意的印象。直到我们旅行的车子驰行在不太平坦的乡间公路上，我们的陪伴者轻声地告诉我们说已经进入了“乃格鲁·弗特”区的时候，我的思想才开始被即将接触的新生活所吸引，从记忆的漩涡里转回来。
      “乃格鲁·弗特”区，真是个充满诱惑性的名子。它对我这个来自中国的客人，已经是很熟悉的了。当我第一次在布加勒斯特的罗马尼亚人民共和国农业成就展览馆的图表上，看到了用一面小红旗标志着这个区农业全部达到合作化的那一刻起，就和它发生了极其亲切的情感。现在，它已经展现在我们面前了。我们首先看到了它丰收的景象：一群群的收割机、成队的卡车、健壮的牛马，满布在辽阔无际的金黄的麦田中。女庄员们的红头巾和多彩的衣裙，花朵一般迎风摆动。
    我们在一个叫戈巴丁的乡村停下来。虽然，这宽阔多树的村庄里，大多是一排排整齐的新房子，而且，乡政府附近已经初具了小市镇的模样，可是，那树荫下歇晌的老牛，四处可以听到的鸡啼声，街道上成群的鹅鸭和扬着尘土的马车，稀疏的几间旧日的草舍，爬在树上或用棍棒摘打杏子吃的赤脚的孩子们，靠在低矮的篱墙上微笑着向我们招手的妇女们……，这一切，都使我感到异常亲切。我觉得如同走进了自己生长和长期工作过的中国农村。
    我们从这里诚挚的人们嘴里，知道了全乡已有78％的农户参加了集体农庄，20％的农户参加了共耕社。集体农庄和共耕社的土地，都可以请拖拉机站代耕，或部分的锄草、施肥和收割。集体农庄的庄员，平均每人一年可得到三百个劳动日，好的劳动者可得到五百；就是妇女，最少也能得到一百五十。（每个劳动日的收入，除蜂蜜、牛奶、水果等副产品外，仅粮食收入，已约合三十个列伊左右）。这些象征着走社会主义道路的农民的幸福、富裕生活的数字，使我们更加兴奋了。我们提出了一个过于麻烦主人的要求，想在农民家里住几天。这要求一说出口，立刻得到了乡干部的热心帮助和农民的欢迎。就在当天中午，我被一个在区政府管理合作社仓库的，叫米哈伊的老头带进他的家里去。
    当我跟着米哈伊老伯伯走进他家的时候，正在屋子外间操作各种家务的三四个妇女，一看到我这个中国的女客人，没有等到米哈伊做介绍，就都一个个地丢开了织布梭子、捻羊毛的钎子、编织花边的钩针等，站拢来迎接我。他们中间，有一个低矮瘦小的老太太，她的眉头间堆着皱纹，一身素色的衣裙上系着自织的带图案花纹的毛布围腰。她跑上来，一下就把我抱住了，然后，又用她那双劳动一生的粗大的手掌，为我拍打身上的尘土。屋子里平静安闲的生活和劳动秩序被我扰乱了。这个给我让座位，那个为我安放行李。只见米哈伊老伯伯向老太太指了指左手的屋门，老太太马上把屋门打开，大家都示意叫我进去。
    屋子里异常清洁、整齐和美丽的陈设，使我的脚步迟疑了一下，我怕盖满尘土的鞋子会弄污了铺满屋子的花地毯。就在这一瞬间，老太太已经拿来一把毛刷，亲手把我的鞋子刷干净了。我几乎是被簇拥着进入了内室。
    我放下了手提包，定了定神，在谐调的光线中，屋内的一切更清楚地映入我的视线了。天花板饰有花纹，墙壁上围挂着各色花毛毯，床铺上摆着大大小小绣着各色图案的方、圆枕头；高高低低的桌凳安置得十分恰当，并且每一个上面都铺着带有鲜明的民族色彩的台布或坐垫。靠床头边的一张小圆桌上，放着一瓶鲜花，紧靠着鲜花有一个玻璃框，里面装有一张浓眉大眼、微笑着的青年男子的半身照片。在四周墙壁上，还疏疏落落地挂着这个青年人和别人的另一些照片。
    米哈伊老伯伯开始向我做介绍了。他首先拉着那位低矮的老太太，同他并肩站着，连声叫着：“玛的亚·米哈伊”。我立刻会意这是他的老伴。然后他告诉我他们有三个孩子。老太太兴奋地取下了挂在墙上的一个镜框，里面装着九张四寸半身像片。两位老人一同指着那浓眉大眼的青年说，那就是他们的大儿子德米特鲁·米哈伊。他去年刚刚从苏联学习回来，现在在康斯坦萨做工程师，这屋子是他假日时偶然回来休息的，平常由两个妹妹住着。这时，站在我身旁的一个穿红色花纹衣裙的姑娘，伸出两个指头告诉我，她是这家的二女儿，名叫比哈，和姐姐伊利娜一同在“五月八日”集体农庄工作。
    九张照片的正中间一张，是一个生着圆圆面孔的中国女孩子。大家齐声告诉我，这是德米特鲁在莫斯科时的同学。这时，我完全忘记了自己是在万里之外做客人，而像是小时候放学回家或行军中来到游击队的老妈妈那里一样温暖和亲切。虽然语言交流仍然十分困难，但，心和心之间，连一点距离都不存在了。他们人人都是指指照片又指指我，好像在说：过去我们只在照片上看到中国人，现在住到我们家来了。他们合不住嘴地在笑。老太太亲热地问到我的妈妈、爸爸、孩子和我自己。姑娘们照例是最关心爱情问题的，她们细致地要我告诉她们有关爱人和中国家庭的一些情况。比哈和伊利娜两姐妹，争着从橱柜里拿出自己亲手纺织的、色彩更艳丽的毛毯、枕头等给我看，这些都是农闲中和平日休息时间做来准备结婚用的东西。幸福的光芒闪在青年姑娘的眼睛里和脸庞上。从她们身上，我看到了罗马尼亚人民共和国优越的社会制度带给青年男女，尤其是妇女的自由和爱情。
    我真说不出有多么高兴：在古巴丁我有了一个罗马尼亚的家，一位罗马尼亚的老妈妈。就这样，我早出晚归，工作得更加起劲了。每天早晨，当我一起床，老妈妈就捧着一个花纹十分美丽的陶磁坛子，把散发着浓郁花香的蜂蜜盛满一小碟；然后，又送来一小杯热咖啡，并且要守着我吃下去，问我甜不甜，香不香。她看见我不住地点头又连声说着很好时，满意地笑得眼睛眯成了一条缝。
    每个夜晚，我无论什么时间回到家里，一推开门就是一阵响亮的迎接我的笑声。这时，米哈伊老伯伯已经下了班，两个女儿也都从田地里回来了，老妈妈已为他们准备好了可口的晚饭。他们明明知道我已在乡政府食堂里吃了饭，可是，总是围坐在桌子旁，守着一盏擦得十分明亮的煤油灯，等着我回来。于是，我又坐在他们中间，和大家一起吃着老妈妈亲手做的菜，喝着在井里冰过的啤酒。老伯伯趁着一点酒兴，又讲故事一般谈起他们由苦到甜的生活。这样，我进一步知道了这个贫农人家的底细：他原来是罗马尼亚的马其顿族人。在地主资产阶级统治的社会里，战争使他们颠沛流离，他曾经在保加利亚的大地主庄园里做过多年雇工。罗马尼亚解放后，才重回祖国。政府把从地主没收来的土地，像分给很多无地农民一样分给他家九公顷。1950年，村子里一建立集体农庄，他们就第一批参加了。
    有时候，谈话谈到了深夜，一家人还兴致很浓地要打开留声机或收音机要我一同来听音乐。他们多么热爱自己祖国的民间曲调啊。随着音乐的节拍，老妈妈不穿鞋袜的双脚，在地毯上轻轻地舞动起来。
    “这部留声机是德米特鲁从莫斯科买回来的。你听，声音有多好：收音机是我们罗马尼亚自己的东西，也不错呵！现在我们农庄里四百二十户人家有一大半都买了这些东西……”老伯伯像农庄主席一样，用铅笔在我的小记事本上写着这些数字，夸耀着他们幸福的生活。老妈妈也插嘴说：
      “还有三百多家盖了像我们这样的新房子，我们不再住泥棚和挡不住风雨的草房了，还添置了衣服，家具……”
    白天，在访问的空闲里，老妈妈要一个人带我去看她按照农庄规定自己经管的一些家当。她走过猪圈，给自己的肥猪加上一瓢饲料；看见那几只大羊，就伸手去抚摸它们，像是感激它们供给一家人用的羊毛。一群母鸡和小鸡，见她走过，唧唧咕咕地都围着她叫唤。她从围裙口袋里，掏出一把粮食，撒到地上，就又向种着西红柿、茴香等等的小菜园走去。她带着希望的表情对我说：她还要积钱买一条乳牛，学着养些蚕，使生活过得更富裕。
    当我结束了访问工作要离开古巴丁的时候，我不敢把这消息过早地告诉老妈妈。可是，要走的那天清晨，米哈伊老伯伯在天一明，已经把这不愉快的消息告诉全家人了。难怪比哈和伊利娜都没像平日那样早到突击队去。我刚一下床，大家都拥上来把我抱住了，都表示舍不得我走。还是老伯伯提醒了我们，车子已经在门口等着我，大家才都迅速地帮我收拾东西。我最后一次吃下了老妈妈的蜂蜜和咖啡，眼睛却不敢正视每一个人依恋的面孔。米哈伊老伯伯早就把我的行李拿出门去，老妈妈还紧紧搂着我不肯放手。这时，我看见她的深陷的眼睛里盈满了泪珠。
    院子里和邻舍的人被惊动起来，都出来送我了。我和所有的人握手又握手，说了无数声再见，还是舍不得快走。汽车的喇叭在近处召唤啦，最后，我扑到老妈妈怀里，嘶声的叫了一声：“妈妈，再见！”我觉得老妈妈发抖的手臂把我搂得更紧了，她的嘴唇最末一次亲着我的额头时，眼泪滴到了我的脸上。
    我已经走了很远，回头来还看见木栅门前一片抬起的臂膀，低矮的老妈妈站在最前面，她一面揉着眼睛，一面还不停地挥手向我送别。　寄自罗马尼亚
