    What an "Arrangement"!
    Shen Pengnian
    Many folk opera performers have not received appropriate arrangements and care, leading to dire straits in their lives and preventing them from dedicating themselves to improving their art. Are things arranged and taken care of more appropriately in art troupes run by the public? Not necessarily.
    The Fourth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has a bureau-affiliated cultural troupe, and this troupe has some ballad singers. This year, in May, the troupe "arranged" for an old ballad singer. Why the "arrangement"? How was it "arranged"? And what were the consequences of the "arrangement"?
    The old artist, Wei Bingshan, is fifty-nine years old this year and is skilled in singing Xibei Dagu ballads. He performs great works like "The Generals of the Hu Family," "The Young Heroes," and "The Seven Kingdoms" well and has been an artist for over forty years. During the Anti-Japanese War, he joined the Chinese Communist Party and did a lot of propaganda work. In 1952, he came to work for the cultural troupe of the Fourth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. After working for four years, this May, he was "arranged" to become a "night watchman" at the bureau's Fengtai Lumber Mill.
    The reason for the "arrangement" is simple: it is no longer appropriate for him to perform on stage!
    After the "arrangement," Comrade Wei has to work twelve-hour night shifts frequently. One night, he fell and injured his arms and legs. An old artist always loves his art. He wrote several letters to the leaders of the cultural troupe and the Fourth Engineering Bureau requesting a job transfer, but the bureaucrats ignored him.
    Can't this old artist be asked to teach apprentices? Can't he be arranged to perform the great works he is good at? These methods may not be perfect, but they are much more appropriate than being a "night watchman." Of course, the bureaucrats will roar: "Night watch is also revolutionary work!"
    The consequence of the "arrangement": Many artists who know Comrade Wei Bingshan are very angry about this, and some are even "deeply worried"!

### 好一个“安排”

    好一个“安排”
    沈彭年
    不少民间戏曲艺人没有得到适当的安排照顾，弄得生活狼狈不堪，不能致力于艺术的精进。在公家举办的艺术团体中是不是就都安排得照顾得比较适当了呢？不尽然。
    铁道部第四工程局有一个局属的文工团，这个文工团里有一部分曲艺演员。今年5月该团就“安排”了一个曲艺老艺人。为什么“安排”？怎样“安排”的？“安排”的后果如何呢？
    老艺人魏炳山今年五十九岁，擅长说唱西河大鼓。像“呼家将”、“少英烈传”、“前后七国”等大书都说得不错，有四十余年的艺龄。在抗日战争期间参加了中国共产党，做过不少宣传工作。1952年到铁道部第四工程局文工团工作，工作了四年，到今年5月，被“安排”到工程局丰台制材厂当“守夜人”去了。
    “安排”的理由很简单：上台演唱不合适了！
    “安排”之后，魏老同志要经常值十二小时的夜班，有一天夜里摔了个跟头，手腿都磕伤了。一个老艺人总是热爱自己的艺术的，几次写信给文工团和第四工程局的领导上，要求调动工作，而官僚主义者们置之不理。
    这个老艺人，不可以叫他教教徒弟吗？不可以安排他去表演他擅长的大书吗？这些办法也许不十分周到，但总比当“守夜人”适当多了。当然，官僚主义者们会大吼一声：“守夜也是革命工作！”
    “安排”的后果：不少认识魏炳山同志的艺人知道了这件事，都很气愤，有的还“衷心惶惶”！
