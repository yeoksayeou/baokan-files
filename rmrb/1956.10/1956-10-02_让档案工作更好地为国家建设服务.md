    Comrade Zeng San, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, speaks:
　　Good archival work is a necessary condition for improving the efficiency of government offices and carrying out scientific research. I suggest that all comrades in the Party help with the construction of archival work.
　　Today I want to give a report to the conference on the state of our Party's and the country's archival work.
　　Our Party has led 600 million people in two great revolutions and is continuing to build a great socialist country. Its archives and the state archives since the founding of the country are extremely valuable. Not only do the agencies that produced these archives need to look them up frequently in their work, but national construction departments and scientific research departments will need to study and use them for many years to come. These archives, together with all the archives from the old regime, are the common wealth of the state and the people. Doing a good job in archival work is a necessary condition for improving the efficiency of government offices (the assistance of enemy and puppet archives to the work of eliminating counter-revolutionaries and examining cadres is one example) and carrying out scientific research. Several reports at the conference called on us to sum up historical experience to educate all Party members and the people of the whole country, and called on us to strive to carry out economic construction and cultural construction. In order to respond to the call of the conference, we must strengthen archival work, because the archives undertaking is one of the assistants of economic construction and a department urgently awaiting development in the cause of cultural construction.
　　Our Party attaches importance to archives and archival work. In 1931, the Central Committee of the Party formulated "Measures for the Disposal of Documents" in Shanghai to preserve the archives of the underground Party as much as possible. In the rectification movement that began in 1941, the Central Committee collected a large number of historical documents and compiled them into document collections such as "Before the Sixth National Congress," "Since the Sixth National Congress," and "Two Lines" to educate cadres to sum up historical experience. However, in the past, due to the underground Party and the war environment, it was difficult to preserve archives and to establish a systematic and scientific archival work. After the nationwide liberation, we paid more attention to this work. In January 1955, the Central Committee issued instructions, and in March 1956, the State Council made a decision. China's 1956-1967 scientific development plan (draft) has already listed archival science as a project. The current situation is that in the past few years, some achievements have been made in establishing archives rooms in government offices and archival systems, training archival staff, and collecting revolutionary historical archives and archives of the old regime. However, generally speaking, there are still many problems. The archival work itself is still far from the requirements of the Party and the country for it. (1) In terms of archives rooms in government offices: the archival system has not been universally established, the sorting and preservation methods are not uniform or scientific, many archives accumulated in government offices are simply "locked up," making it very difficult to find them, and there are even phenomena of arbitrarily destroying archive documents. (2) The work of archives is only just beginning. When the greater administrative areas were abolished, we concentrated the archives of the Party and government agencies at this level before we started to establish preparatory institutions for archives. Except for the Ming and Qing archives in Beijing and part of the archives of the Kuomintang Central Government in Nanjing, which have already been concentrated, the archives of the old regime are still scattered in various localities and agencies. Apart from the Archives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the National Archives of the People's Republic of China, which are under construction, we do not yet have a modern archives. The preservation conditions for the archives that have been concentrated cannot be improved for the time being, and scientific sorting and scientific research are still rarely done. The work of compiling "Document Collections" and collecting historical materials that is currently underway is encountering many difficulties due to the lack of concentrated materials and manpower. At present, there are many and urgent demands for the use of archives, but it is difficult for us to adapt. (3) There is a shortage of talents and cadres in the archives field, especially a serious lack of senior research talents. We established the Department of Historical Archives at Renmin University of China, which has trained 29 teachers and 300 graduates of specialized courses in the past four years, and various provinces have conducted short-term training for thousands of in-service cadres. However, in general, the numbers are too small, the level is not high, and the mobility is very high, so the work results are not significant and the accumulation of experience is limited. These shortcomings are primarily due to the insufficient efforts of our document and archives personnel, but it should be pointed out that this is also related to the fact that some comrades in the Party do not pay enough attention to archival work.
　　Therefore, I suggest that all comrades in the Party help with the construction of archival work. First, the state should include the construction of archives in the Second Five-Year Plan; second, all government offices should establish and improve the work of archives rooms, and responsible comrades at all levels should not keep archives themselves, so that archives that should be filed will no longer be lost; third, all provinces and regions and specific departments (such as defense, public security, foreign affairs, literature and art, etc.) should prepare to build archives so that archives that have been concentrated and will be concentrated can be sorted out and made available for use; fourth, Party committees at all levels should conduct regular inspections and supervision of archival work, transfer a sufficient number and quality of cadres, unite all old archival staff, cultivate specialized talents and scientific workers for the archives undertaking, and educate all comrades engaged in archival work and archival scientific research to work actively and study hard, striving to become professional talents with a certain level of business and scientific knowledge, and gradually improve our country's archives undertaking and archives science to a level sufficient to meet the needs of China's economic construction and cultural construction.

### 让档案工作更好地为国家建设服务

    让档案工作更好地为国家建设服务
    中共中央委员会办公厅副主任　曾三同志的发言　
　  作好档案工作是提高机关工作效率和开展科学研究的必要条件，建议全党同志都来帮助档案工作的建设。　　
    我今天要向大会作一个关于我们党的和国家的档案工作情况的汇报。　　
    我们党领导六亿人民进行了两次伟大的革命，正在继续建设着伟大的社会主义国家，它的档案和建国以来的国家档案，是十分宝贵的。不但产生这些档案的机关在工作中经常需要查找，而且国家建设部门和科学研究部门在长久的年代里都需要进行研究和利用。这些档案，加上旧政权时期的一切档案，都是国家和人民的公共财富；做好档案工作是提高机关工作效率（敌伪档案对肃反审干工作的帮助就是一例）和开展科学研究工作的必要条件。大会的几个报告号召我们总结历史经验来教育全体党员和全国人民，号召我们努力进行经济建设和文化建设；为了响应大会的号召，我们就必须加强档案工作，因为档案馆事业正是经济建设的助手之一，又是文化建设事业中急待发展的一个部门。　　
    我们党是重视档案和档案工作的，一九三一年党中央在上海就制定了“文书处置办法”，把地下党的档案尽力保存下来。在一九四一年开始的整风运动中，中央收集大量历史文件编成了“六大以前”、“六大以来”和“两条路线”等文件汇集，来教育干部总结历史经验。但是过去由于地下党和战争的环境，保存档案毕竟是很少的，要建立系统的科学的档案工作也是困难的。全国解放以后，我们就更多地注意了这一项工作。一九五五年一月，中央发出了指示，一九五六年三月国务院又作出了决定。我国一九五六年到一九六七年科学发展规划（草案）已经把档案学作为一个项目列上了。现在的情况是，几年来在建立机关档案室和归档制度、训练档案工作人员、收集革命历史档案和旧政权档案等方面，都作出了一些成绩，但是总的说来，问题还是很多，档案工作本身同党和国家的其他工作对它的要求，距离还是很远。（一）在机关档案室方面：归档制度没有普遍建立，整理方法和保管方法不统一、不科学，许多机关积存的档案只是“锁”起来，很不容易查找，甚至还有随便销毁档案文件的现象。（二）档案馆工作还只是开始。大区撤销的时候，我们把这一级党政机关的档案集中起来，才开始建立档案馆的筹备性机构。旧政权的档案，除北京有明清档案、南京有国民党中央政府的一部分档案已经集中外，其他还是散存各地各机关。除了正在兴建的中共中央档案馆和中华人民共和国国家档案馆以外，我们还没有一个现代的档案馆，对已集中的档案，保管条件一时无法改善，科学整理和科学研究，还做得很少。最近正在进行的编辑“文件汇集”和收集史料的工作，由于材料不集中和人力不足，还遇到许多困难。目前在利用档案方面对于我们提出的要求是很多而又很迫切的，我们却很难适应。（三）档案方面的人材和干部不足，尤其是高级研究人材十分缺乏。我们在中国人民大学建立历史档案系，四年来培养了二十九名教员和三百名专修科毕业生，各省短期集训过数千名在职干部，但是一般说，数量太少，水平不高，流动性很大，所以工作成绩不大，经验积累有限。这些缺点，首先是由于我们文书档案人员的努力不够，但是，应当指出，这同党内有些同志对档案工作重视不够，也是有关系的。　　
    因此，我建议，全党同志都来帮助档案工作的建设。第一，国家应当把档案馆的建设列入第二个五年计划；第二，各机关都要把机关档案室的工作建立和健全起来，各级负责同志不要自己保管档案，使应该归档的档案不致再有散失；第三，各省区和各特定部门（如国防、公安、外交、文学艺术等）都要筹建档案馆，使已经集中和将要集中的档案都能经过整理，提供利用；第四，各级党委要对档案工作给以经常的检查和督促，抽调足够数量和一定质量的干部，团结所有老的档案人员，培养档案事业的专门人材和科学工作者，并教育所有从事档案工作和档案科学研究工作的同志积极工作、努力学习，争取成为一个具有一定业务水平和科学水平的专业人材，把我国的档案事业和档案科学逐步提高到足以适应中国经济建设和文化建设的需要的水平。
