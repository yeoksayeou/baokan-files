Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 30th. Agricultural production cooperatives in the disaster-stricken areas of Hebei Province have demonstrated unparalleled superiority in production and disaster relief, and have become the core for leading farmers in the fight against famine.

According to surveys, within just two months after the disaster, out of the two thousand four hundred and eighty-two agricultural production cooperatives in the Tianjin area, two thousand and sixty cooperatives combined drainage and wheat planting with the development of more than forty types of sideline production. In the severely affected Xingtai and Baoding areas, more than ten million mu of wheat were sown in a timely manner, and one million one hundred thousand cooperative members were organized to engage in sideline production, increasing income by more than sixteen million yuan, and building fifteen thousand houses.

Because agricultural cooperatives truly achieve unified planning and unified arrangement, they can solve the contradictions of insufficient labor for drainage and wheat planting, sideline production, and house construction. In Ningjin County, most of the cultivated land is the water accumulation area of "Ningjin Bo," which has been hit by disasters for three consecutive years, and this year it encountered a flood unseen in decades. However, all two hundred and eighty agricultural production cooperatives in the county immediately formulated production and famine relief plans, with unified arrangements for agriculture and sideline occupations, quickly drained most of the farmland, and overfulfilled the task of sowing 430,000 mu of wheat. At the same time, the speed and scale of various production self-rescue activities have greatly exceeded those of previous years. The Cennan Township Agricultural Cooperative in Renxian County, after suffering from the disaster, was able to develop both cooperative members' household sideline occupations and the cooperative's collective sideline occupations due to good arrangements.

The various collective famine relief activities of agricultural production cooperatives have created more favorable conditions for the dissemination and exchange of production experience and labor techniques. In the Mazhuang Township Agricultural Cooperative of Anxin County, only one person knew how to weave shrimp baskets and catch shrimp with baskets. After the disaster, the cooperative opened a training class to teach cooperative members the techniques of weaving baskets and catching shrimp, enabling more than four hundred cooperative members of the cooperative to learn how to weave baskets and set baskets for catching shrimp, and quickly started shrimp catching production. More than one hundred technical guidance committees and technical groups were established in the disaster-stricken agricultural cooperatives of Wenan County to exchange fishing techniques. The fishing labor force increased by one thousand people, and the daily fish output increased from more than 50,000 catties to more than 70,000 catties.

Agricultural cooperatives have also demonstrated the spirit of unity, mutual assistance, and common cause in production and famine relief. After the Jingxin Agricultural Cooperative in Jingxian County suffered from floods, the production teams that were less affected by the disaster transferred 50,000 catties of grain to support the cooperative members of the seriously affected teams to survive the famine, and the cooperative members of the seriously affected teams went to the less affected teams to help with harvesting. When the Jiucheng Agricultural Cooperative in Longyao County organized cooperative members to spin and weave, it first gave priority to the elderly and widowed households with no labor, and issued them subsidies for house repairs to help them solve their living difficulties.

Due to the above measures taken by the agricultural cooperatives, not only were production and self-rescue activities quickly organized, but also the cooperative organizations were further consolidated.

    河北灾区农业生产合作社
    积极领导农民向灾荒斗争
    新华社保定30日电　河北省灾区的农业生产合作社在生产救灾中显示出无比的优越性，并且已成为领导农民向灾荒作斗争的核心。
    根据调查统计，在灾后短短的两个月内，天津专区的两千四百八十二个农业生产合作社当中，就有两千零六十个社结合着排水种麦活动，开展起四十多种副业生产。灾情较重的邢台、保定专区，也适时播种小麦一千多万亩，组织一百一十万社员从事副业生产，增加了一千六百多万元的收入，并修盖了十五万间房屋。
    由于农业社真正作到统一计划统一安排，就能解决排水种麦、副业生产、修盖房子等劳力调配不开的矛盾。宁晋县绝大部分耕地是“宁晋泊”积水区，已连续三年遭灾，今年又遇到几十年少见的洪水。但全县二百八十多个农业生产合作社，灾后立即作出生产度荒规划，农副业统一安排，很快地就排除了大部农田积水，超额完成播种小麦四十三万亩。同时各种生产自救活动的速度和规模，都大大超过了往年。任县岑南乡农业社，受灾后因为安排的好，社员家庭副业和社里的集体副业都得到了发展。
    农业生产合作社的各种集体度荒活动，又给生产经验劳动技术的传播交流，创造了更加有利的条件。安新县马庄乡农业社只有一个人会编虾篓和用篓捕虾，灾后合作社开了一个训练班，让他向社员传授编篓和捕虾技术，使这个社的四百多社员学会了编篓和下篓捕虾，很快的开展起捕虾生产。文安县灾区农业社建立起一百多个技术指导委员会和技术小组，交流捕鱼技术，捕鱼劳力增加了一千人，每天的鱼产量，由五万多斤增到七万多斤。
    农业社在生产度荒中还发挥了团结互助和同舟共济的精神。景县景新农业社遭受水灾后，受轻灾的生产队曾调运五万斤粮食支援重灾队的社员度荒，重灾队的社员则到轻灾队去帮助收割。隆尧县旧城农业社在组织社员个人纺织时，首先尽无劳力的孤寡户，并发给他们修房补助费，帮助他们解决生活困难。
    由于农业社采取上述措施，不仅迅速的组织起生产自救活动，同时还进一步巩固了合作社组织。
