    Two Questions Concerning the Study of the History of Chinese Philosophy
    Feng Youlan
    The history of philosophy is the history of the development of materialistic thought in the struggle against idealism, and the history of the development of dialectical thought in the struggle against metaphysics. This view of the history of philosophy is the correct theory for the study of the history of philosophy, and at the same time, it is the correct method for studying the history of philosophy.
    Applying this theory and method to practical work still raises some questions. I want to raise two questions of a relatively fundamental nature: First, in what areas does the struggle between materialistic and idealistic thought take place in the history of philosophy? Second, how is this struggle carried out?
    The first question becomes a problem because there is a popular view in the study and teaching of historical materialism that all social, political, and historical ideas before the emergence of Marxism were idealistic [Note 1]. Researchers of the history of philosophy, therefore, believe that the struggle between materialism and idealism in the history of philosophy, before the emergence of Marxism, was primarily conducted in the fields of natural philosophy and epistemology. Before the emergence of Marxism, materialists in natural philosophy and epistemology were still idealists in social, political, and historical views. Therefore, in social, political, and historical views, there was no struggle between materialism and idealism, but only the struggle between progressive and conservative ideas, and the struggle between revolutionary and reactionary ideas.
    We all acknowledge that materialistic thought in the history of philosophy represents the interests of advanced classes, while idealistic thought represents the interests of backward or reactionary classes. However, there is no struggle between materialism and idealism in social, political, and historical views, which are directly related to class interests. What is the reason for this? How are materialistic ideas in natural philosophy and epistemology related to progressive ideas in social, political, and historical views, and how are idealistic ideas in natural philosophy and epistemology related to conservative or reactionary ideas in social, political, and historical views? Is there necessarily a logical connection? Is there indeed a factual connection? These questions have caused a lot of trouble in our research and teaching work, and have also sparked many debates in our teaching and research office.
    Recently, I feel that we have been constrained by dogmatism in this regard. Some comrades in our teaching and research office raised different opinions from the above-mentioned ones very early on. At that time, I did not agree with these different opinions, believing that they were inconsistent with the theory. Recently, I have gradually felt that these different opinions are correct.
    First, let’s talk about the view of history. Of course, before the emergence of Marxism, no one recognized that the transformation of the mode of production was the main reason for historical development. This theory was created by Marxism and is the key point of Marxist historical materialism. In this sense, there was indeed no materialistic view of history before the emergence of Marxism.
    However, Marxist historical materialism also believes that, in addition to the mode of production, population and geographical environment are also material conditions of social life, and although they do not play a major role in historical development, they do play a certain role. In the history of philosophy, there are also views that explain historical changes using the increase or decrease of population or the advantages and disadvantages of the geographical environment. This view of history is certainly incorrect. If we say it is one-sided, mechanical materialism, or vulgar materialism, it is easy to understand. However, according to the theory mentioned above, we would have to say it is idealistic. Why is it idealistic? I have asked many people, but I have not received a satisfactory answer.
    Let me give an example. Han Fei of the pre-Qin period believed that the rate of population growth far exceeded the rate of growth of means of subsistence. "Now people have five sons, which is not considered many, and the sons also have five sons. Before the grandfather dies, there are twenty-five grandsons," but the means of subsistence cannot increase that quickly. Therefore, "In ancient times... the population was small and there was a surplus of wealth..., so generous rewards were not practiced, heavy punishments were not used, and the people governed themselves." Later, "the population became large and the wealth was scarce, the labor was hard and the supply was thin, so the people struggled. Even with doubled rewards and repeated punishments, chaos could not be avoided." (Above from "Han Feizi" "Wu Du"). According to his theory, the main reason for the society's evolution from the primitive classless "people governing themselves" to the state rule of class society was the increase in population. This is certainly incorrect. But compared to the idealistic theory of explaining history with "great men" or "God's will," this attempt to explain history with the material conditions of social life should still be considered to have a principal distinction.
    Another example is "Guanzi" "Shui Di" which believes that water is the origin of all things in nature, and also the determining factor of changes in things in society. The light, clear, or heavy, turbid nature of the water in each place determines the character of the local people, and the character of the people determines the changes in things in society. Therefore, to change the social situation, one must first change the water, "Therefore, the sage's governance of the world is not based on people's reports or household explanations; its key lies in water." Saying that the changes in things in society are determined by the character of the people is certainly an idealistic view. But saying that water determines the character of the people, although also wrong, is also an attempt to explain history with the material conditions of social life. It seems that we cannot just say it is idealistic.
    If it is said that these views are all incorrect, so they cannot be called materialistic thought, but materialistic thought in the history of philosophy is not necessarily all correct. Some Western materialists believe that the brain "secretes" thoughts, just like the gallbladder secretes bile. This is also an incorrect and absurd view. But we only say it is vulgar materialism, and do not say it is idealistic because it is absurd.
    I believe the fact is that in terms of historical views, there was also materialistic thought before the emergence of Marxism, just as in terms of natural philosophy and epistemology. But in either case, the previous materialistic thought was one-sided, mechanical, or vulgar.
    The textbook "Historical Materialism" edited by Konstantinov, on the one hand, says, "As for social and historical phenomena, idealism occupied a completely dominant position in this area before Marx." (Chinese version, page 14). On the other hand, it also says: "Advanced bourgeois thinkers and utopian socialists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries put forward many scientific arguments and conjectures. These arguments and conjectures were what Marx and Engels could rely on and did in fact rely on" (page 16). If these arguments are scientific and were also relied upon by Marx and Engels, it seems difficult to understand if we still insist on calling them idealistic. If we say that they are neither idealistic nor materialistic, but only scientific, then it is even more difficult to understand.
    In social and political thought, there are many struggles that are actually struggles between materialism and idealism. For example, in the history of Chinese philosophy, the issue of innate goodness versus innate evil is a widely debated issue from the pre-Qin period to modern times. In the pre-Qin period, Mencius advocated "innate goodness," believing that the inherent nature of people is good because it originally contained moral principles endowed by "Heaven." This is certainly an idealistic view. Xunzi advocated "innate evil," believing that "Heaven" is only "nature," which does not contain moral principles, and people's moral qualities come from education and learning. This direct negation of Mencius' idealistic thought should be materialistic thought.
    Later, Song and Ming Neo-Confucianism distinguished between "Heavenly Principle" and "Human Desire," emphasizing that "Heavenly Principle" should rule "Human Desire." The so-called "Heavenly Principle" is actually the objectified and absolutized feudal moral principles. Philosophers who opposed Song and Ming Neo-Confucianism, such as Chen Liang, Wang Fuzhi, and Dai Zhen, believed that "Heavenly Principle" is the appropriate development of "Human Desire," denying the dominant position of "Heavenly Principle" over "Human Desire," and putting people's desires and emotions in the primary position. This is also a direct negation of the idealism of Song and Ming Neo-Confucianism. This thought should also be materialistic.
    The examples cited above are not sufficient to fully illustrate my point, because we can say that the issues of "innate goodness" and "innate evil" and "Heavenly Principle" and "Human Desire" still involve the issue of natural philosophy, and it is only a manifestation of the issue of natural philosophy.
    Then let me give another example. Around the Opium War, Chinese society was in the process of transitioning from a feudal society to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. In this process, the representatives of advanced thought were Gong Zizhen and Wei Yuan. Gong and Wei were both believers in Buddhism, and in terms of natural philosophy, they were thorough idealists, but they advocated "practical learning for the sake of worldly affairs." Wei Yuan believed that there were two accumulated problems in people's minds at that time. One was "sleep," which was ignorance and incompetence; the other was "emptiness," which was emptiness and unreality. He advocated "using real things to measure real achievements, and measuring real achievements with real things" (preface to "Illustrated Treatise on Maritime Kingdoms"). He demanded that intellectuals at the time abandon poetry, fu, and eight-legged essays and learn practical knowledge. He put forward four principles of thought methods: "Those who speak well about the heart must have proof in things," which means that one cannot rely solely on subjectivity and separate oneself from objectivity. "Those who speak well about people must have resources in laws," which means that one cannot rely solely on personal intelligence and separate oneself from tools and methods. "Those who speak well about the past must have proof in the present," which means that one cannot talk about the past and separate oneself from the present. "Those who speak well about oneself must be in accordance with things," which means that one cannot stick to one's own opinions and separate oneself from the opinions of others (preface to "Huangchao Jingshi Wenbian" "Guweitang Waiji" Volume 3). The spirit of these four principles is that objective things are more important than subjective opinions. He said that the weight of a thing itself determines the number of kilograms on the scale, not the number of kilograms on the scale determines the weight of a thing itself ("Light and heavy are determined by weights and measures, not weights and measures create light and heavy"). This thought should be said to be materialistic, and the subjectivism it opposes is idealistic (in the full text of this article, there are still many idealistic elements). The struggle he carried out was the struggle between materialism and idealism.
    From the questions raised above, we should not limit the struggle between materialism and idealism to the scope of natural philosophy and epistemology. The struggle between materialism and idealism runs through the entire field of human thought. In every department of the field of thought, there is a struggle between materialism and idealism. In the process of historical development, there is a struggle between materialism and idealism at all times. However, the concentrated manifestation of this struggle is often around the most pressing issues in life during a certain period. These issues are not necessarily all issues of natural philosophy and epistemology. These issues are not completely consistent in the histories of various eras or nations.
    Even so, the key point of these struggles is still the question of which is primary, matter or spirit, and which is secondary. For example, saying that the increase in population or the nature of water determines social changes is to believe that matter is primary and spirit is secondary. Saying that objective things determine subjective opinions, not subjective opinions determine objective things, is also to believe that matter is primary and spirit is secondary. All these arguments ultimately come down to the question of which is primary, matter or spirit, but "matter" and "spirit" cannot be understood only in the natural philosophical sense. Of course, these questions, in the end, are still related to the question of which is primary, matter or spirit in natural philosophy, but they are not directly these questions.
    There is also a point: the struggle between materialism and idealism in an era probably begins in the social and political aspect, and then penetrates into the natural philosophy and epistemology aspects. That is to say, the struggle begins with issues directly related to life, and then gradually rises to the height of natural philosophy and epistemology [Note 2].
    In the pre-Qin period, let us not discuss whether Confucius' social and political thought was progressive or conservative, but the struggle he carried out was in the social and political aspect, not in the natural philosophical aspect. Mozi's political and social thought was progressive, but his natural philosophy inherited the traditional religious views of the time. In modern times, the struggle of Gong and Wei was also in the social and political thought aspect, and it was not until Kang Youwei and Tan Sitong that this struggle was raised to the height of natural philosophy and epistemology. Kang, Tan, Gong, and Wei are a line of succession.
    The struggle between materialism and idealism in the history of philosophy must be understood in this way to see that this struggle is constantly ongoing and continuous. If we limit the struggle between materialism and idealism to the aspects of natural philosophy and epistemology, then in terms of modern Chinese thought, although great changes took place in society from the Opium War to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, there was no struggle between materialism and idealism in thought. The struggle between materialism and idealism sometimes breaks off, which is all incomprehensible.
    I personally feel that understanding this point resolves some of the problems that have often troubled us in teaching and research work in recent years. For example: Mozi's "Three Standards Method" is a materialistic method of thinking, and his social and political thought is also progressive, but why does he also advocate "Heaven's Will" and "Manifesting Ghosts"? Gong and Wei's natural philosophy is the idealism of Buddhism, why can it have a progressive effect at that time?
    In fact, things are very simple. The thought of a person, or the thought of an era, cannot be understood all at once. Some understand it in this point, but not in that point; some understand it in that point, but not in this point. The point that a person or an era first understands is probably related to the most pressing issues in life. In modern times, we can see very clearly that China abruptly changed from a feudal society and fell into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal position. The most pressing issue in life at that time was to make some changes in the social and political aspects that were adapted to the objective situation. Gong and Wei launched the struggle between materialism and idealism in this aspect. The more intense the struggle, the deeper the thought must be, and the more the theory must be improved. This gradually raised the struggle between materialism and idealism in the social and political aspects to the height of natural philosophy and epistemology. The issues around which the struggle revolves are different, but its thread is consistently connected from beginning to end.
    The history of philosophy is the history of the struggle between materialism and idealism. This is the generality of the history of philosophy. This struggle is carried out around different issues in the philosophical history of various eras and nations. This is the particularity of the philosophy of various eras and nations. The work of studying the history of philosophy should show the general in the particular. This kind of generality is the concrete truth with flesh and blood. The history of Chinese philosophy must be done in this way to show its rich content and its characteristics.
    The above is about the scope of the struggle between materialism and idealism. The following discusses how this struggle is carried out.
    In the past few years of work, we have always believed that to explain the situation of the struggle, we must first draw a clear line. On this line, materialism and idealism are "two armies facing each other," each inheriting its own tradition along the "Yellow River" that serves as the "boundary," and each developing, like two parallel lines, serving their respective class interests. In the process of their respective development, these two camps often engage in hundreds of rounds of fighting, one strike for another. Apart from this, it seems that there are no other relationships between them.
    Now it seems that such treatment simplifies the problem and only sees one side of the problem. Materialism and idealism are two opposite sides of the same thing (philosophy). They repel each other, but also influence each other and permeate each other. This is the contradiction and unity of the two opposite sides. In recent years, we have dealt with the issue of the struggle between materialism and idealism in the history of Chinese philosophy, only emphasizing their mutual exclusion, and not paying attention to their mutual influence and mutual penetration. Although this side is relative, it is always a one-sided error to not recognize that there is this side.
    Let's take an example. Song and Ming Neo-Confucianism was basically materialistic at the beginning. The philosophical ideas of Zhou Dunyi and Zhang Zai both believed that "qi" (氣) was primary. Later, Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi turned to idealism. Wang Fuzhi (Chuanshan) abandoned Cheng-Zhu and directly inherited Zhang Zai, establishing his great system of materialistic thought. This line of development is very clear. That's what we said in our teaching work.
    But this is only one aspect. On the other hand, Wang Fuzhi inherited Zhang Zai, but not simply inherited, not returned to Zhang Zai as it was. He abandoned Cheng-Zhu, but not simply abandoned. He passed through Cheng-Zhu, and then abandoned Cheng-Zhu, passed through Cheng-Zhu, and then inherited Zhang Zai. In the dialectical development of history, in the dialectical development of human understanding, "passing through" is not a simple thing. "Passing through" contains absorbing its rational parts and removing its dross, and "passing through" contains raising.
    Specifically, Zhang Zai believed that material "qi" is the original entity of the natural world. The existence of things in the natural world, including people, is due to the "gathering of qi." "Qi gathers" to form things, and when qi scatters, things disappear. He said: "When qi gathers, the bright and clear (can be used as an object of sensation) and has form; when it does not gather, the bright and clear cannot be used and has no form" ("Zheng Meng" "Tai He"). This is a materialistic thought. But there is obviously a problem here, that is, since the things in the natural world are all "gatherings of qi," why is a tree a tree and not grass, and grass is grass and not a tree?
    Cheng-Zhu answered this question. They believed that the gathering and scattering of "qi" is carried out according to a certain "li" (理). The meaning of "li" in Cheng-Zhu's terms is very complex. On this issue, "li" is a law or type. The relationship between "li" and things is the relationship between "general" and "special." Things in the natural world are all "gatherings of qi," but because their gathering has different laws and types, the objects that they form also differ. Zhang Zai also talked about "li," but he talked about it very little and not as clearly. After Cheng-Zhu said it so clearly, it answered a question raised by Zhang Zai's materialistic thought that was not clearly answered.
    If Cheng-Zhu only talked about "li" to this extent, they would not have turned to idealism. But they further exaggerated the role of "li," believing that "li" can exist prior to "things," that is, that the "li" of trees and grass originally existed even when there were no trees or grass. This is the statement of objective idealism.
    Wang Fuzhi, Yan Yuan, Li Gong, and Dai Zhen refuted this statement, believing that "li is in things," that is, the laws of things are within things and cannot exist separately from things. The general is in the special. This is correct. They abandoned Cheng-Zhu, but they passed through Cheng-Zhu. Without Cheng-Zhu's proposition of "li existing before things," it would have been difficult for them to put forward the proposition of "li existing in things." Cheng-Zhu turned to idealism from Zhang Zai's foundation, and opposed Zhang Zai. Wang Fuzhi turned to materialism from Cheng-Zhu's foundation, and opposed Cheng-Zhu. In one sense, Cheng-Zhu negated Zhang Zai, and Wang Fuzhi negated Cheng-Zhu again. This is the negation of negation. The negation of negation is not simply returning to the original affirmation, but has passed through the negation and contains the rational parts within it.
    In the history of Western philosophy, the relationship between Aristotle and Plato, in one sense, is also similar. Recently, historians of philosophy who talk about the history of Western philosophy place Aristotle on one side of the "two armies facing each other," and place Socrates and Plato on the other side, as if there were no other relationships between them except for the struggle. This is also only talking about one side of the facts. This side is certainly important, but it is impossible to avoid one-sided errors if the other side is not talked about at all.
    Aristotle called Socrates' contribution "seeking definitions by induction," that is, using induction to seek the essence of things. Plato inherited this work, and just in this regard, they are correct. Plato's mistake lies in separating the general from the particular, like the later Cheng-Zhu, and becoming the proposition of "li existing before things," becoming objective idealism. Aristotle's proposition on this issue is also "li existing in things." His proposition is correct, and Plato's proposition is wrong. But Aristotle also got his proposition by "passing through" Plato. He negated Plato, but not simply negated.
    Speaking of which, it involves the issue of how to treat idealism. Lenin said: "From the point of view of crude, simple, metaphysical materialism, philosophical idealism is nothing but nonsense. On the contrary, from the point of view of dialectical materialism, philosophical idealism is a one-sided, exaggerated, excessive... development (inflation, expansion) of a certain feature, aspect, part of cognition into an absolute that is detached from matter, detached from nature, and deified." ("On the Question of Dialectics")
    Our philosophical history work in recent years has been to regard idealism as something meaningless. We are looking at it from the "point of view of crude, simple, metaphysical materialism," not from the "point of view of dialectical materialism." Lenin's words quoted above have clearly told us how we should deal with idealism.
    The debate on "li existing before things" and "li existing in things" in Chinese and Western philosophical history mentioned above can illustrate the meaning of Lenin's words as I understand them. Let me give two more examples for further explanation.
    In the history of Chinese philosophy, Zhuangzi recognized that things are constantly changing. All the properties of things are relative. Just in this regard, his views are correct and contribute to dialectical thought, but he exaggerated this point one-sidedly and excessively, to the point of becoming relativism. According to his relativistic argument, since things are constantly changing, there can be no relative stability, so one thing is no different from another. Since all the properties of things are relative, big things can be said to be small, and small things can be said to be big. "Nothing in the world is bigger than the tip of an autumn hair, and Mount Tai is small; no one lives longer than a stillborn child, and Peng Zu is short-lived" ("Qiwu Lun"). This becomes sophistry.
    Gongsun Long's debate on "a white horse is not a horse" is also sophistry, there is no question about that. But he recognized the distinction and contradiction between "general" and "individual." Just in this regard, his views are correct. His mistake is that he only saw the contradiction between them and did not see the unity between them. He also exaggerated this contradiction one-sidedly and excessively, believing that "everything in the world is unique and correct" ("Jian Bai Lun"), and there can be no connection between any things. Therefore, there is the sophistry of "a white horse is not a horse."
      "Harmonizing similarities and differences" and "separating hardness and whiteness" are two major debates in the history of Chinese philosophy. Zhuangzi-Huishi's relativism belongs to the category of the "harmonizing similarities and differences" debate. Gongsun Long has the debate of "a white horse is not a horse," and also has the debate of "separating hardness and whiteness." These are all sophistry. Their relativism and sophistry should be refuted and criticized. But the "rational core" in it should also be affirmed, because it represents an aspect of the human cognition process.
    The Greek philosopher Zeno had many debates, pointing out the contradictory nature of motion, thereby attempting to prove that motion is not an objective existence, but only people's illusion. What he tried to prove was wrong. But he revealed the dialectical nature of motion, revealing objective dialectics, which should be affirmed. Such treatment is correct. The debates of the "debaters" of pre-Qin China, such as "the shadow of a flying bird has never moved" and "the arrow flies fast but there are times when it does not go and does not stop," should also be treated in this way.
    It is precisely because there is a "rational core" in idealism that it can have a side of unity or identity in addition to contradiction and mutual exclusion in its opposition to materialism. Its rational part should be said to be materialistic, because it is in line with objective things.
    Lenin pointed out: "The process of human cognition is not a straight line, ... but a curve, very similar to a string of rings, a spiral," each small segment of which, if exaggerated one-sidedly, can become an independent and complete straight line, leading people to clericalism. Here, the interests of the ruling class will consolidate it. "Clericalism (that is, philosophical idealism) certainly has its epistemological roots; it is not without a foundation; it is indeed a flower that does not bear fruit, but this flower that does not bear fruit is growing on the living tree of living, fruitful, real, powerful, omnipotent, objective, absolute human cognition." ("On the Question of Dialectics") This big tree is the unity of the two opposites: philosophy.
    Marx said: "The main defect of all previous materialism - including that of Feuerbach - is that the object, reality, sensibility is understood only from the object side or from the intuitive side, not as human sensory activity, not as practice, not from the subjective side. Therefore, the result is: the active side is developed by idealism in opposition to materialism, but only abstractly developed, because idealism of course does not know that there is truly real activity" ("Theses on Feuerbach"). Idealism, of course, cannot correctly understand the activity of people. If it correctly understands it, it would no longer be idealism. But its development in this respect shows the shortcomings of mechanical materialism, and thus a higher materialism, dialectical materialism, appears. Human cognition gradually improves layer by layer, and the history of philosophy gradually develops layer by layer.
    This also explains that the development of the human cognition process is not a straight line, but a curve, that is, dialectical. Lenin said: "Dialectics is a living, multifaceted (and the number of facets is eternally increasing) cognition, which contains countless currents for observing reality, approaching reality (each current develops into a whole philosophical system). Compared with 'metaphysical' materialism, it is incomparably rich in content." ("On the Question of Dialectics")
    Our recent philosophical history work probably uses the method of metaphysical materialism, simplifying and vulgarizing the struggle between materialism and idealism in the history of philosophy, making the originally rich and lively history of philosophy become poor and rigid. In fact, the history of philosophy is the development of that big tree that Lenin said. Its content is extremely rich; its development is extremely lively. The task of the history of philosophy is to realistically describe the development of that tree that Lenin said. This is the fighting goal of philosophical historians.
      [Author's Note] This article is not intended to provide a comprehensive discussion of the method of studying the history of philosophy and the evaluation of idealism. Therefore, it only talks about the epistemological roots of idealism, not its class roots, and only talks about the logical inheritance of ideological development in the history of philosophy, not the connection between these developments and social politics. This article only raises two relatively key issues encountered in our recent work for discussion, and puts forward preliminary opinions. Please give us your advice. The "we" mentioned in some places in the text include myself. The words of criticism in the text are mainly not criticism of others, but self-criticism of my work on the history of Chinese philosophy in the past few years.
      [Note 1] Engels said: "All previous views of history were based on the idea that the causes of all historical changes should ultimately be sought in the thoughts of the changing people, and that the most important and decisive of all historical changes was political change" ("Karl Marx"). Lenin also pointed out: The view of history before the emergence of Marxism had two main shortcomings ("Karl Marx"). However, Engels also said that before the emergence of Marxism, the new schools of French and British historians also looked for the driving force of European history outside of people's thoughts ("Karl Marx"). The exact meaning of these words of Engels and Lenin still needs further study. Now our problem is not whether this popular statement has classical basis, but how we should explain the historical facts mentioned below.
    [Note 2] There is a popular saying that the history of Greek philosophy began with the study of nature. This is because some historians of philosophy write the history of philosophy in this way. The facts are not entirely so.

    关于中国哲学史研究的两个问题
    冯友兰
    哲学史是唯物主义思想在与唯心主义斗争中发展底历史，是辩证法思想在与形上学的斗争中发展底历史。这种哲学史观是关于哲学史研究的正确的理论，同时，也是研究哲学史底正确的方法。
    把这个理论与方法，应用到实际的工作中也还有些问题。现在要提出的是两个比较带有原则性的问题：第一，在哲学史里唯物主义思想与唯心主义思想底斗争是在那些范围内进行的？第二，这样的斗争是怎样进行的？
    第一个问题之所以成为问题，因为在历史唯物主义底研究和教学里，现在有一种流行的说法，就是认为在马克思主义出现以前，所有的社会政治思想和历史观都是唯心主义的〔注一〕。研究哲学史的人，由此也就认为，哲学史中的唯物主义与唯心主义底斗争，在马克思主义出现以前，基本上是在自然观和认识论范围里进行的。马克思主义出现以前，自然观和认识论方面的唯物主义者，在社会政治思想和历史观方面也还是唯心主义者。因此，在社会政治思想和历史观方面，没有唯物主义与唯心主义底斗争，只有进步思想与保守思想底斗争，革命思想与反动思想底斗争。
    我们又都承认，哲学史中的唯物主义思想是代表先进阶级利益的思想；唯心主义思想是代表落后的或反动的阶级利益的思想。可是，在与阶级利益直接有关的社会政治思想和历史观中却没有唯物主义与唯心主义底斗争，这是甚么道理呢？自然观和认识论方面的唯物主义思想和社会政治、历史观方面的进步思想，自然观和认识论方面的唯心主义思想和社会政治、历史观方面的保守或反动思想，怎样联系起来呢？在逻辑上是否必然都有联系呢？在事实上是否果然都有联系呢？这些问题，在我们底研究和教学工作里，引起了不少的麻烦，在我们教研室里，也引起了不少的争论。
    近来，我觉得我们在这一方面是受了教条主义的束缚了。在我们教研室里，很早就有同志提出跟上面所说的不同的意见。当时我不赞成这种不同的意见，认为它与理论不合。近来我逐渐觉得，这种不同的意见是正确的。
    先就历史观说。当然在马克思主义出现以前，没有人认识到生产方式底变革是历史发展底主要原因。这个理论是马克思主义所独创，也是马克思主义底历史唯物主义底要点。就这种意义说，在马克思主义出现以前，确没有唯物主义的历史观。
    但是马克思主义底历史唯物主义也认为，除生产方式之外，人口和地理环境，也是社会生活底物质条件，对于历史底发展，虽不起主要的作用，也起一定的作用。在哲学史里也有用人口底增减或地理环境底优劣，说明历史底变化的观点。这种历史观诚然是不正确的。如果我们说它是片面性的，是机械唯物主义或庸俗唯物主义的，倒是很容易理解。但是，根据上面所说的理论，我们就要说它是唯心主义的。为什么是唯心主义的？我问过很多人，都没有得到满意的回答。
    举个例说吧，先秦的韩非认为人口增长底速度，远超过于生活资料增长底速度。“今人有五子不为多，子又有五子，大父未死，而有二十五孙”，可是生活资料不能增加这样快。因此，“古者……人民少而财有余……，是以厚赏不行，重罚不用，而民自治。”后来“人民众而货财寡，事力劳而供养薄，故民争，虽倍赏累罚，而不免于乱。”（以上“韩非子”“五蠹篇”）。照他底这种理论，社会由原始无阶级的“民自治”进到阶级社会底国家统治，其主要的原因是由于人口的增加。这当然是不正确的。但跟用“大人物”或“上帝意志”解释历史的唯心主义的理论比较起来，这种企图用社会生活物质条件解释历史的理论，似乎还应该认为是有原则上的区别。
    又例如“管子”“水地”篇认为水是自然界万物底本原，也是社会中的事物变化底决定因素。各地方底水底轻清或重浊底性质，决定当地人民底性格，人民底性格决定社会中的事情底变化。所以要想改变社会情况要先要改变水，“是以圣人之治于世也，不人告也，不户说也，其枢在水”。说社会中的事情底变化，决定于人民底性格，这当然是唯心主义的见解。但是说水决定人民底性格，这虽然也是错误的，但也是企图用社会生活物质条件解释历史的理论，似乎还不能就说它是唯心主义的。
    若说，这些见解都不正确，所以不能称为唯物主义思想，但是哲学史中的唯物主义思想，并不一定都是正确的。西方有些唯物主义者认为脑子“分泌”思想，就像胆分泌胆汁一样。这也是不正确而且很荒唐的见解。但是我们只说它是庸俗唯物主义思想，不因其荒唐而说它是唯心主义思想。
    我认为事实是，在历史观方面，在马克思主义出现以前，也有唯物主义思想，正如在自然观和认识论方面。但是无论在那方面，以前的唯物主义思想，都是片面性的机械的或者庸俗的。
    康士坦丁诺夫主编的“历史唯物主义”教科书一方面说，“至于说到社会的、历史的现象，那末在马克思以前，是唯心主义在这方面占着完全统治的地位。”（中文本页14）。一方面也说：“先进的资产阶级思想家以及十八世纪和十九世纪的空想社会主义者，曾提出过许多科学的论点和推测。这些论点和推测是马克思和恩格斯可以依据并且事实上已经依据了的”（页16）。这些论点既然都是科学的，而且还为马克思和恩格斯所依据，若一定还要说它是唯心主义的，似乎不好理解。若说它既不是唯心主义的，也不是唯物主义的，而仅只是科学的，那就更不容易理解了。
    在社会政治思想方面，有不少的斗争，其实也就是唯物主义与唯心主义底斗争。例如在中国哲学史里，性善与性恶，是从先秦到近代一直引起广泛争论的问题。就先秦说，孟子主张“性善”，认为人底与生俱来的本性是善的，因为其中本来就有“天”所赋予的道德原则。这当然是唯心主义的见解，荀子主张“性恶”，认为“天”只是“自然”，其中没有道德原则，人底道德品质，是从教育学习得来的。这种直接否定孟子底唯心主义的思想应该是唯物主义的思想。
    后来宋明道学作为“天理”“人欲”底分别，强调“天理”应该统治“人欲”。其所谓“天理”实际上就是客观化、绝对化了的封建道德原则。反对宋明道学的哲学家，如陈亮、王夫之、戴震，认为“天理”即是“人欲”底适当的发展，否认“天理”对于“人欲”底统治地位，把人底欲望情感放在第一性的地位。这也是对于宋明道学的唯心主义的直接的否定。这种思想也应该是唯物主义的。
    上面所举的例，还不足以充分说明我底论点，因为我们可以说“性善”“性恶”和“天理”“人欲”底问题，还是牵涉到自然观的问题，它只是自然观的问题底一种表现形式。
    那么让我再举个例说吧。鸦片战争前后，中国社会处在由封建社会转入半殖民地半封建社会底过程中，在这个过程里，先进思想底代表人物就是龚自珍和魏源。龚、魏都是佛教底信徒，在自然观方面，都是十足的唯心主义者，但是他们提倡“经世致用之学”。魏源认为当时人心中的积患有二。一是“寐”，就是昏庸无知；一是“虚”，就是空虚不实。他主张“以实事程实功，程实功程实事”（“海国图志”序）。他要求当时的知识分子抛去诗赋八股，学习有实用的学问。他提出了思想方法底四项原则：“善言心者必有验于事”，就是说，不能离客观而专靠主观。“善言人者必有资于法”，就是说，不能离工具法度而专靠个人的聪明。“善言古者必有验于今”，就是说，不能离今而谈古。“善言我者必有乘于物”，就是说，不能离别人底意见而专持自己底意见（“皇朝经世文编序”“古微堂外集”卷三）。这四项原则底精神是认为客观的事物重于主观的意见。他说，一件东西本身底重量决定秤上的斤两数目，不是秤上的斤两数目决定一件东西本身底重量（“轻重生权衡，非权衡生轻重”）。这种思想应该说是唯物主义的，它所反对的主观主义思想是唯心主义的（就这篇文章底全文而论，其中也还有不少唯心主义底因素）。他所进行的斗争是唯物主义与唯心主义底斗争。
    从上面所提出的这些问题看起来，我们不应该把唯物主义与唯心主义底斗争限制到自然观和认识论底范围之内。唯物主义与唯心主义底斗争是贯穿在人底整个的思想领域之内。在思想领域底各个部门，都有唯物主义与唯心主义底斗争。在历史底发展过程中，时时刻刻都有唯物主义与唯心主义底斗争。不过这个斗争底集中表现，经常是围绕着某一时期底生活中的最迫切的问题。这些问题，不一定都是自然观和认识论方面底问题。这些问题在各时代或各民族底历史里，也不都是完全一致的。
    虽然如此，这些斗争底要点，还是物质和精神之中，那个是第一性，那个是第二性底问题。例如说，人口底增加，或水底性质，决定社会底变化，这是认为物质是第一性的，精神是第二性的。说客观事物决定主观意见，不是主观意见决定客观事物；这也是认为物质是第一性的，精神是第二性的。这一切争论归根到底都是物质和精神之中那个是第一性底问题，不过不可以把“物质”和“精神”只了解为自然观上的意义。当然这些问题推到最后，也还是与自然观上的物质和精神那个是第一性的问题有关系的，但并非直接就是这些问题。
    还有一点，一个时代底唯物主义与唯心主义底斗争，大概都开始于社会政治方面，而后深入到自然观和认识论方面。这也就是说，斗争开始于与生活直接有关的问题上，而后逐渐提到自然观和认识论底高度（注二）。
    就先秦说，我们且不论孔子底社会政治思想是进步的或保守的，他所进行的斗争是在社会政治方面而不是在自然观方面。墨子底政治社会思想是进步的，但是自然观因袭了当时传统宗教底见解。就近代说，龚、魏底斗争也是在社会政治思想方面，一直到康有为和谭嗣同才把这个斗争提高到自然观和认识论底高度。康、谭和龚、魏是一脉相承的。
    哲学史中的唯物主义与唯心主义底斗争，必须这样理解，才可以看出来，这个斗争，是经常在进行，继续不断的。假使我们把唯物主义与唯心主义底斗争限制到自然观和认识论方面，那末就中国近代思想说，从鸦片战争到太平天国，虽然社会起了很大的变革，但在思想上却没有唯物主义与唯心主义底斗争。唯物主义与唯心主义底斗争，有时会中断，这都是不可理解的。
    我个人感觉到，搞通了这一点，就解决了近几年在教学研究工作里经常使我们苦恼的一些问题。例如：墨子底“三表法”是唯物主义的思想方法，他底社会政治思想也是进步的，但是为甚么他又主张“天志”“明鬼”？龚、魏底自然观是佛学的唯心主义，为甚么能在当时发生进步作用？
    其实，事情很简单，一个人底思想，或一个时代底思想，都不是一下子就能搞通的。有的在这一点上通了，在那一点上不通；有的在那一点上通了，在这一点上不通。一个人或一个时代所先搞通的那一点，大概都是与生活中的最迫切的问题有关的。就近代说，我们看得很清楚，中国从封建社会急转直下，堕入半殖民地半封建的地位，当时生活中的最迫切的问题是在社会政治方面作些与客观情况相适应的变革。龚、魏就在这一方面展开唯物主义与唯心主义底斗争。斗争越激烈，思想就要越深入，理论就要越提高。这就一步一步地把社会政治方面的唯物主义与唯心主义底斗争提高到自然观和认识论底高度。斗争所围绕的问题不同，但其脉络线索是前后贯穿的。
    哲学史是唯物主义与唯心主义斗争底历史，这是哲学史底一般性。这个斗争在各时代和各民族底哲学史里是围绕着不同的问题进行的，这是各时代各民族底哲学的特殊性。研究哲学史底工作，应该在特殊里显出一般。这样的一般才是有血有肉的具体真理。中国哲学史必需这样作，才可以显出它底丰富的内容和它底特点。
    以上所谈的是唯物主义与唯心主义斗争底范围的问题。以下谈这样的斗争是如何进行的。
    在这几年的工作中，我们总认为要说明斗争底情况，必先划出一个明确的阵线。在这阵线上，唯物主义与唯心主义“两军对垒”，沿着“为界”的“黄河”，各自继承着各自底传统，各自发展，像两条平行线一样，为各自的阶级利益服务。这两个阵营在各自发展底过程中，时常你一刀我一枪，战个几百回合，除此之外，好像其间没有其他的关系。
    现在看来，这样的处理，是把问题简单化了，是只看到问题的一面。唯物主义与唯心主义是一个东西（哲学）底两个对立面。它们互相排斥，而又互相影响，互相渗透，这就是两个对立面底矛盾与统一。这几年来，我们处理中国哲学史中的唯物主义与唯心主义斗争底问题，只强调于其互相排斥，而没有注意于其互相影响，互相渗透。固然这一面是相对的，但是不承认有这一面，总是片面性底错误。
    举一个例说吧。宋明道学在开始底时候，基本上是唯物主义的。周敦颐和张载底哲学思想都认为“气”是第一性的。到了后来，程朱就倒向唯心主义。王夫之（船山）撇开了程朱，直接继承张载，建立了他底唯物主义的伟大思想体系。这个发展底线索，是很清楚的。我们在教学工作里，就是这样说的。
    可是这只是一方面，另一方面是，王夫之继承张载，但并不是简单地继承，并不是照原样回复到张载。他撇开程朱，也不是简单地撇开。他是经过程朱，而又撇开程朱，经过程朱而又继承张载。在历史底辩证发展中，在人类认识底辩证发展中，“经过”并不是简单的事情。“经过”包涵吸收其合理的部分而去其糟粕，“经过”包涵着提高。
    具体地说，张载认为物质性的“气”是自然界底原始实体。自然界底事物，包括人在内，其存在都是由于“气之聚”。“气聚”而为事物，气散则事物消亡。他说：“气聚则离明得施（可以为感觉底对象）而有形，不聚，则离明不得施而无形”（“正蒙”“太和”）。这是唯物主义的思想。可是在这里显然有一个问题，就是自然界底事物既然同是“气之聚”，何以树是树而不是草，草是草而不是树？
    程朱回答了这个问题，他们认为“气”之聚散，是照一定的“理”进行的。程朱所谓“理”，意义很复杂。在这个问题上，“理”是规律或类型。“理”与事物的关系，是“一般”与“特殊”底关系。自然界底事物，同是“气之聚”，但因其聚有不同的规律和类型，所以其聚而成物，也就有不同。张载也讲到“理”，但是讲得很少，也没有这样地明确。经程朱这样明确地说，就回答了一个由张载底唯物主义思想所引起而没有明确回答的一个问题。
    程朱讲“理”，如果只讲到这里为止，也还没有倒向唯心主义。可是他们却进一步地夸大了“理”底作用，认为“理”可以先于“事”而存在，就是说，在没有任何树，任何草底时候，本来就有树和草底“理”。这就是客观唯心主义底说法。
    王夫之、颜元、李塨、戴震，驳斥了这种说法，认为“理在事中”，就是说，事物底规律，就在事物之内，不能离事物而单独存在。一般就在特殊之中。这是正确的。他们撇开了程朱，但是经过了程朱。如果没有程朱底“理在事先”底主张，他们也很难提出“理在事中”底主张。程朱从张载底基础上转向唯心主义，与张载对立起来。王夫之又从程朱底基础上转向唯物主义，与程朱对立起来。在一种意义上，程朱否定了张载，王夫之又否定了程朱，这就是否定之否定。否定之否定，并不是简单地回复到原来的肯定，而是经过了否定，包涵了其中的合理的部分。
    在西方哲学史里，亚力士多德跟柏拉图的关系，在一种意义上，也有类似的情形。近来讲西方哲学史的哲学史家，把亚力士多德放在“两军对垒”底这一边，把苏格拉底、柏拉图放在那一边，好像他们三人之间，除了斗争之外，没有其他的关系。这也是只讲事实底一面，这一面固然是重要的，但是若完全不讲其他的一面，也是不能免于片面性的错误。
    亚力士多德称苏格拉底的贡献是“以归纳法求定义”，就是用归纳法求事物底本质。柏拉图继承了这个工作，专就这一点说，他们是不错的。柏拉图底错误在于像后来的程朱一样，把一般同个别分离开来，成为“理在事先”底主张，成为客观唯心主义。亚力士多德在这个问题上的主张也正是“理在事中”。他底主张是正确的，柏拉图底主张是错误的。但是亚力士多德也是“经过”了柏拉图而才得到他底主张的。他否定了柏拉图，可是并不是简单地否定。
    说到这里，就牵涉到如何对待唯心主义底问题。列宁说过：“从粗陋的、简单的、形而上学的唯物主义的观点看来，哲学唯心主义不过是胡说。相反地，从辩证唯物主义的观点看来，哲学唯心主义是把认识的某一个特征、方面、部分片面地、夸大地、过分地……发展（膨胀、扩大）为脱离了物质、脱离了自然、神化了的绝对。”（“谈谈辩证法问题”）
    我们近年来的哲学史工作，就是把唯心主义看成是毫无意义的东西。我们是从“粗陋的、简单的、形而上学的唯物主义的观点”来看。而不是从“辩证唯物主义的观点”来看。究竟应该怎样对付唯心主义，上面所引列宁底话，已经清楚地告诉了我们。
    上面所举的在中国和西方哲学史里，关于“理在事先”和“理在事中”底争论就可以说明，照我所了解的列宁底话底意义。再举两个例作进一步的说明。
    在中国哲学史里，庄子认识到事物是经常在变化中的。事物所有的性质都是相对的。专就这一点说，他底见解是正确的，对于辩证法思想是有贡献的，但是他把这一点片面地过分发挥，以至于成为相对主义。照他底相对主义底论点，既然事物是经常在变化中，所以也就不可能有相对的稳定性，因此一个事物跟别的事物没有分别。既然事物所有的性质都是相对的，因此大的东西也可以说是小，小的东西也可以说大。“天下莫大于秋毫之末，而泰山为小，莫寿乎殇子，而彭祖为夭”（“齐物论”）。这就成为诡辩。
    公孙龙底“白马非马”底辩论，也是诡辩，这是没有问题的。但是他认识到“一般”和“个别”底分别和矛盾。专就这一点说，他底见解是正确的。他底错误在于他只见到其间的矛盾，没有见到其间的统一。他又把这个矛盾片面地过分地发挥，认为“天下皆独而正”（“坚白论”），任何事物中间，都不可能有任何的联系。于是就有“白马非马”底诡辩。
      “合同异”，“离坚白”是中国哲学史里两个大辩论。庄子惠施底相对主义是属于“合同异”这一类的辩论。公孙龙有“白马非马”的辩论，也有“离坚白”的辩论。这都是诡辩。他们底相对主义和诡辩是应该驳斥和批判的。但是其中的“合理的内核”也是应该肯定的，因为它代表人类认识过程的一个方面。
    希腊哲学家芝诺，有许多辩论，指出运动底矛盾性，由此企图证明运动不是客观的存在，而只是人们底幻觉。他所企图证明的是错误的。但是他揭示了运动底辩证性质，揭示了客观辩证法，这是应该肯定的。这样的处理是对的。对于中国先秦“辩者”们底“飞鸟之景未尝动也”、“镞矢之疾而有不行不止之时”等辩论，也应该这样的处理。
    正因为唯心主义中也有其“合理的内核”，所以它能在与唯物主义的对立中，除矛盾和互相排斥之外，还可以有统一或同一底一面。它底合理的部分，应该说是唯物主义的，因为它是与客观事物相符合的。
    列宁指出：“人类认识过程并不是一条直线，……而是一条曲线，酷似一串环圈，一个螺旋”，其中每一小段，如果加以片面地夸大，就可能变成一独立完整的直线，把人引到僧侣主义中去。在这里统治阶级底利益就会把它巩固起来。“僧侣主义（亦即哲学唯心主义）当然有其认识论上的根源；它并不是没有根基的，它确实是一朵不结果的花，但这一朵不结果的花却是在生动的，结果的，真正的，强大的，全能的，客观的，绝对的人类认识这株活的树木上生长着的。”（“谈谈辩证法问题”）这株大树就是包括两个对立面的统一物：哲学。
    马克思说：“从前一切唯物主义——连费尔巴哈的也包括在内——所含有的主要的缺点，就在于把事物、现实、感性只是从客观方面或从直观方面加以理解，而不是理解为人的感性的活动，不是理解为实践，不是从主观方面加以理解。所以结果竟是这样：能动的方面竟是跟唯物主义相反地被唯心主义发展了，但只是被它抽象地发展了，因为唯心主义当然不知道有真正现实的活动”（“费尔巴哈论纲”）。唯心主义对于人底能动性，当然不能正确地理解，如果正确地理解，它也就不是唯心主义了。但是它在这一方面的发展，就显示出机械唯物主义底缺点，由此出现更高的唯物主义，辩证唯物主义，人类底认识就是这样一层一层地逐步提高，哲学史就是这样一层一层地逐步发展。
    这也就说明人类认识过程底发展，不是一条直线的，而是曲线的，也就是辩证的。列宁说：“辩证法是生动的，多方面的（而且方面数目是永恒增加的）认识，其中包含着无数种观察现实，接近现实的流派（每种流派又发展成为整个哲学体系）。它与‘形而上学’唯物论相较，内容丰富得无比。”（“谈谈辩证法问题”）
    我们近来的哲学史工作，大概用的是形而上学唯物主义的方法，把哲学史中的唯物主义与唯心主义底斗争，简单化，庸俗化了，使本来是内容丰富生动的哲学史，变成贫乏、死板。其实哲学史是列宁所说的那个大树底发展。它底内容是极其丰富的；它底发展是极其生动的。哲学史底任务，就是要把列宁所说的那棵大树底发展如实地描写出来。这是哲学史工作者底奋斗底目标。
      〔作者附记〕本文并不是要对于哲学史研究底方法和对于唯心主义的估价，作全面的讨论，因此，只说到唯心主义底认识论的根源，没有说到它底阶级根源，只说到哲学史中思想发展底逻辑继承性，没有说到这些发展与社会政治的联系。本文只是把我们近来工作中所遇到的比较有关键性的两个问题提出讨论，并提出初步意见，请大家指教。文中在有些地方所说的“我们”都包括我自己在内。文中的批评之词主要的不是批评别人，而是对于我这几年中国哲学史工作的自我批评。
      〔注一〕恩格斯说过：“所有以前对于历史的见解，都以下述观念为基础，即一切历史变动的原因，归根到底应当从变动着的人们的思想中去寻求，并且在一切历史变动中，最重要的、决定全部历史的是政治变动”（“卡尔·马克思”）。列宁也指出：马克思主义出现以前的历史观有两个主要的缺点（“卡尔·马克思”）。但是恩格斯也说，在马克思主义出现以前，法国历史家和英国历史家底新学派也于人底思想之外，去找欧洲历史底推动力（“卡尔·马克思”）。恩格斯和列宁底这些话底确切意义，还要进一步的研究。现在我们的问题不在于这种流行的说法有没有经典上的根据，而在于我们对于下面所说的历史事实，应该怎样解释。
    〔注二〕有一种流行的说法，认为希腊哲学史是从对于自然的研究开始的。这是由于有些哲学史家底哲学史是这样写的。事实却不尽然。
