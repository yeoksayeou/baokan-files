According to a United Press International report from Manila: Manila Mayor Arsenio Lacson, upon returning to Manila by plane from Hong Kong on the evening of the 12th, accused the British authorities in Hong Kong of a "careless and sloppy" attitude towards the disturbances, and criticized them for not being able to control the riots in the Kowloon area. Lacson pointed out that the British authorities "did not take appropriate measures earlier." He said, "Many people have died, and the British are trying to minimize the news about the number of deaths and injuries, which only shows that the British are no good, even for the welfare of the colony."

    新华社13日讯　据合众社马尼拉消息：马尼拉市长阿塞尼奥·拉克森12日晚上乘飞机从香港回到马尼拉以后指责香港英国当局对待骚动的“马虎草率”的态度，指责它没有能力控制九龙地区的骚乱。拉克森指出英国当局“没有早一点采取适当的措施”。他说，“死了许多人，英国人设法想缩小关于死伤数字的消息，这只是说明，即使为殖民地福利，英国人也是不行的”。
