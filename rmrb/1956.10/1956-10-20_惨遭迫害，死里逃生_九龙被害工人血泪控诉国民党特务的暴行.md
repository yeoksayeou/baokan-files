Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th: Hong Kong dispatch: Some workers who tragically suffered persecution and escaped death in the Kowloon Tsuen Wan massacre on the evening of October 11th, are using their experiences to accuse the Kuomintang special agent thugs of their heinous crimes.

A enamel worker who was at the enamel workers' union in Hoi Pa Village at the time of the incident, told a Ta Kung Pao reporter on the 17th: "When the thugs began to riot, I saw the arches at Furong Mountain, ×× School, and ×× Yarn Factory flashing on and off, as if signaling for communication and command. At about eight o'clock (in the evening), the first group of thugs appeared, throwing stones at the association, but they were repelled. Shortly after the second group of thugs was repelled, a large number of thugs attacked in three routes. At that time, I saw a Kuomintang party flag sticking out diagonally from the staircase of a house opposite the association. There were thirty-one workers left inside the association at that time.

"The thugs surrounded the association on three routes. At this time, the thugs shone strong lights on us, and large chunks of stones were thrown wherever the light shone. All the doors and windows were shattered. At the same time, they threw explosives upstairs. They threw three in a row, with loud explosions and a foul smell. We didn't know what these things were, guessing they were either fish bombs or sulfur bombs. Then they threw towels soaked in gasoline into the building and lit them. The situation was very chaotic and dangerous. The thugs took the opportunity to demand that the Kuomintang flag must be hung and that the five-star national flag must be burned. At more than ten o'clock, the association was stormed by the thugs. Except for ten people who took the opportunity to escape, the remaining twenty-one people fell into the hands of the thugs.

"We twenty-one people were stripped of our upper body clothes by the thugs on the spot, and they were taken away to be burned. Each person was held by two thugs and taken downstairs to parade in the streets. At this time, I saw that among those thugs, each person had a black cloth tied on their left hand, some people had flashlights, and each person had a white, blue, and red rectangular metal badge on their chest. We were shouted at and taken to the vicinity of the Da Zhonghua Tea House in Hoi Pa Village, where the thugs began to loot, robbing each of us of our watches and money. After our clothes were completely searched and looted, they began to beat us, and everyone was beaten until their skin was torn and their flesh was rotten.

"After the thugs beat us up, they tied us together with cloth and drove us from Kwan On Street to the front of Chung Hwa School, forcing us to kneel on the flower bed. On the way, the thugs shouted reactionary slogans under the command of their leader, and forced us to shout as well. Some of us refused to shout, and the thugs became angry and wanted to kill us. In front of Chung Hwa School, the thugs 'lectured' us, saying: 'You still don't know you're going to die, don't you know about the counterattack against the mainland?' Some thugs said: 'The past seven years have been unpleasant, we are the happiest today!' At this time, the Kuomintang party song was broadcast from Chung Hwa School. The thugs were arrogant at this time, and some thugs were chattering, discussing what cruel methods to use to deal with us.

"At that time, the leader of this group of thugs ordered the thugs to say: 'Beat them half to death.' We were then driven to the front of the Hong Luen Bakery Company. On the way, we were beaten with hammers, wooden sticks and other weapons. Two workers were immediately seriously injured.

"When we arrived at the front of the Hong Luen Bakery Company, it was still a terrifying hell. The ground was covered with blood. There were thirty or forty people lying in pools of blood, motionless like corpses. It was a terrible sight. At this time, the thugs grinned and said: 'Can you see? You will be dealt with in the same way.'

"At that time, it was almost one o'clock in the morning. We saw British soldiers and police arriving at the old Tsuen Wan bridge near the Hong Luen Bakery Company. The thugs dispersed with a roar. Then, the police came to us and said: 'You are murderers!' We said that if we were murderers, we wouldn't be injured and wouldn't be staying here. Then we reported the whole situation to the police.

"Not long after the military and police arrived, a person came out of a shop near the Hong Luen Bakery Company in the dark and told us that he had rescued a female worker who had fallen here. Later, we got up and went to the workers who were lying in the pools of blood and asked them to untie the ropes that were binding their hands. We also helped up those who were seriously injured, but each of us was exhausted, and it took six people to lift one injured person. After moving the injured to the side, we asked the police to send them to the hospital. The police said: 'There is a curfew now, there is no way.' Later, we asked the British army for permission. At about two o'clock, a car came and sent the injured to the hospital in three batches."

A twenty-three-year-old female worker in Tsuen Wan told Wen Wei Po reporters on the 17th about the Kuomintang bandits' atrocities. She said: On the evening of October 11th, when Kuomintang special agents set fire to the Bao Xing Yarn Factory, she and dozens of workers rushed out of the flames, but were intercepted by dozens of thugs holding iron rulers and water pipes inside the factory. Her head was broken, and she fell to the street. During this period, the thugs tore her shirt and skirt to pieces, and even her underwear and pants were torn off. At this time, she was ashamed, painful, and hateful. Thugs like wolves, in groups, surrounded this naked girl, pushing her naked body back and forth, wantonly insulting her. When she fell, they stepped on her. She was bleeding all over. Later, several thugs picked her up, lifted her high, and threw her onto the hard ground covered with sharp gravel. She then passed out.

Later, many workers found her and found her torn and blood-stained skirt nearby to cover her lower body. Several people worked together to carry her back to the factory.

These pieces of cloth are still kept by this girl, as bloody evidence. Doctors examined her injuries and found that the muscles of her buttocks were also covered with wounds.

Another girl, two years younger than this girl, was also a yarn factory worker. She was seriously injured, and her chest, back, and the back of her hands were bruised and swollen.

When she recalled the terrifying situation that night, she said that when the incident happened, she and the aforementioned female worker rushed out of the fire together. When she walked outside the factory building, she was surrounded and beaten by hundreds of thugs, and she lost contact with the other girl.

When she desperately rushed out of the encirclement of the thugs in the chaos, she found that the buttons on her upper body had been torn off by the thugs. She was lucky to escape.

Another female worker from the yarn factory talked about the terrifying situation that night, saying that she was almost smashed to death when she rushed out of the factory and was intercepted by the thugs. The bruise behind her neck has not yet cleared, and her waist, back, back of her hands, etc. are also covered with scars. She said that she had been knocked unconscious and fell on the street. The thugs thought she was dead. It was not until three hours later that she was rescued by workers from the same factory.

This female worker is from another province and has no relatives in Hong Kong. When talking about the factory being burned down, the workshop being destroyed, and herself being injured, she choked with tears and said to the reporter: "I don't know when I will be able to start work!"

Wen Wei Po also published a photo on the 18th of a piece of paper stained with many bloodstains, on which Lin Weibing, a female medical worker at the Tsuen Wan Workers' Medical Center, wrote for help after being severely beaten. One side of the paper was written in cursive script: "I can't say it. Please inform the medical center to save my life, Lin Weibing." The other side of the paper read: "If I wait any longer, I will...because I am seriously injured internally."

This female medical worker was forcibly stripped of her clothes and taken to the front of the Hong Luen Bakery by Kuomintang special agent elements that night, where she was severely beaten. She was later rescued by nearby residents. Because she was too injured to speak at the time, she hastily wrote a few words on a piece of paper and asked the residents to pass it on to the medical center. She is currently hospitalized in the Army Hospital.

    惨遭迫害，死里逃生
    九龙被害工人血泪控诉国民党特务的暴行
    新华社广州18日电　香港消息：在10月11日晚上九龙荃湾血案中惨遭国民党特务匪徒迫害死里逃生的一些工人，以自己的遇害经过控诉国民党特务分子的滔天暴行。
    一位事发时正留在海坝村搪瓷工会里的搪瓷工人，17日向大公报记者叙述说：“当暴徒开始暴动时，望见芙蓉山、××学校、××纱厂三处的牌楼当时一亮一黑，好像打信号联络指挥一样。大概八点钟（晚上）左右，就出现了第一批暴徒，向会所投石，旋被击退，当在第二批暴徒被击退后不久，大批暴徒分三路进攻。当时看到会所斜对面一间屋子楼梯上，斜伸出一只国民党党旗。那时留在会所内的工人共有三十一人。
    “三路暴徒把会所包围，这时暴徒用强烈灯光射上来，一大块一大块石头就随着灯光照到的地方掷来，门窗玻璃全部粉碎，同时又将爆炸品掷上楼来，一连投了三个，爆炸声很大，发出难闻味道，大家都不懂这是什么东西，揣测不是鱼炮就是硫磺弹。跟着又把浸满汽油的毛巾，燃着了投入所内。这时情形很混乱，处境十分危险，暴徒就乘机要挟，提出一定要悬挂国民党旗，要烧掉五星国旗。到了十点多钟，会所被暴徒攻入，除有十人乘机逃出外，其余的二十一人就落在暴徒手中。
    “我们二十一人，当场被暴徒剥掉了上身衣服，拿去烧掉。每人均被两个暴徒挟持，捉到楼下去游街。这时候，看到那些暴徒当中，每人左手扎有黑布，部分人手持电筒，每人胸前佩有白、蓝、红三色长方形金属徽章。我们一路被呼喝着挟到海坝村大中华茶楼附近，暴徒就开始劫掠，将我们每人的手表、钞票全部抢去。当我们身上衣物搜劫殆尽后，便开始殴打，每个人都被打得皮开肉烂。
    “暴徒把我们打了一顿后，用布把我们连环缚住，从群安街赶到中华学校前，迫我们上花台跪下，途中暴徒在头子指挥下喊反动口号，还强迫我们喊，我们有些人死不肯喊，暴徒恼怒，要把我们这批人打死。在中华学校前，暴徒向我们‘训话’说：‘你们还不知死，反攻大陆都不知道？’又有暴徒说：
  ‘过去七年来不愉快，我们今日最快乐啦！’这时候，从中华学校播出国民党党歌。暴徒此时气焰嚣张，有些暴徒则在吱吱喳喳，商量用何种狠毒办法来处置我们这批人。
    “当时这群暴徒的头子，命令暴徒说：‘打到他们半生不死’。我们于是又被赶到红莲面包公司门前，那时一路行一路被暴徒用铁锤、木棍等凶器毒打，两个工友马上被打得受了重伤。
    “到了红莲面包公司门前一看，仍然是一处恐怖的地狱，遍地是血，已倒卧在血泊中的就有三四十人，像一条条的死尸一动也不动，形状可怕，这时暴徒狰狞笑道：‘看不看见呀，你们也一样这样处置。’
    “那时候将近凌晨一时了，看到英军和警察开到了红莲面包公司附近的荃湾旧桥头，暴徒即呼啸而散。随后，就有警察向我们行来，见到我们就说：‘你们是杀人凶手！’我们说，如果是凶手就不会受伤，不会留在这里了。接着就把经过情形向警察报告。
    “军警陆续开到以后不久，红莲面包公司附近的一间店铺，黑暗中有一个人走出来告诉我们，他已经将倒在这里的一个女工救起。后来我们就起来向那些倒在血泊中的工友靠近去，他们叫我们替他们解掉绑手的绳子。我们又将那些重伤的扶起来，但我们每个人都已没有了气力，要六个人才抬得起一个伤者。将伤者移到一旁去，就向警察要求送入医院，警察说：‘现在戒严，无办法。’后来又向英军要求方才允许。大概两点钟上下，才有车来，分三批把那些伤者送进医院。”
    荃湾一位二十三岁的女工17日向文汇报记者控诉国民党匪徒的暴行。她说：10月11日晚国民党特务在宝星纱厂纵火时，她和几十个工友从烈焰中冲出，但在厂内即为几十个手持铁尺和水喉管的暴徒截住。她的头颅被打破，跌倒在街上。在这段时间，暴徒就将她的衫裙撕得一片一片的，内衣内裤也被扯脱。这时候，她已又羞又痛又恨。和狼一样的暴徒，成群结队的围着这个身无寸缕的少女，把她的赤裸身体推来推去，肆意侮辱，推倒了就用脚踩，她周身流着血，后来被几个暴徒抬起举高掷进满布三尖碎石的硬地上，她以后就昏了过去。
    后来有许多工人发现了她，在附近找回她那条被撕得破碎而且染满血迹的裙子让她遮护住下身，几个人合力把她抬回工厂。
    这些裙布现在还由这位少女保存着，这是血的证据。医生检查她的伤势发现她的臀部的肌肉也满是伤迹。
    比这位少女年轻两岁的另一个少女，也是一个纱厂女工，她伤得很重，前胸、脊背、手背都瘀肿了。
    她回忆当晚的恐怖情形时说，事情发生时，她和前述的那位女工一起从烈火中冲出。当她走到厂房外时就又给成百个暴徒围打，这时她俩失去联络。
    当她在混乱中拚命地冲出暴徒的包围时，发现上身的衫钮已被暴徒扯开了。她幸而脱险。
    另一位纱厂女工谈起当晚恐怖的情形时说，她冲出厂外被暴徒截住时，几乎被砸死了。她颈后间的瘀痕现在还没散清，她的腰部、背部、手背等处也遍是伤痕。她说，她曾被打昏，倒伏街上，暴徒以为她死了，过了三个多钟头，才被同厂的工友救回。
    这位女工是外省籍人，没有亲属在香港。谈起工厂被焚，车间被破坏，自己又受伤时，她哽咽地对记者说：“不知要到那个时候才能开工呢！”
    文汇报18日还刊载了荃湾工人医疗所女医务员林伟冰在受毒打后，伤重求救的一张染着许多血迹的纸张的照片，这张纸的一面了草的写着：“有口不说得，请工友通知医疗所救命，林伟冰”。纸的另一面写的是：“再等我就……因我内部很伤”。
    这位女医务员是在当晚被国民党特务分子强将衣服脱光拥至红莲饼家前毒打，后为附近居民救回。她当时因伤重不能讲话，就索纸笔草草写了几句话托居民转知医疗所。她现仍在陆军医院留医中。
