Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 5th: According to TASS, the Eighth Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council approved the Regulations for Activities of the International Laboring People's Solidarity Fund on October 3rd.

The regulations stipulate: The International Laboring People's Solidarity Fund is used to support, without discrimination, the laboring people and their trade union organizations in their struggle to improve living standards, social progress, and safeguard democracy and trade union rights. The fund will provide material assistance to workers and their families who are on strike or engaged in other forms of struggle to achieve their demands; to victims of disasters or unfortunate accidents at work; and to victims of repression—laboring people and their families. The fund will also be used to provide legal defense for persecuted trade union activists and to support trade unions in colonial and underdeveloped countries.

The regulations also stipulate: The funds of the International Laboring People's Solidarity Fund are drawn from the membership dues paid by the national trade union federations and professional trade unions that have joined the World Federation of Trade Unions, as well as from voluntary contributions from trade union organizations, trade union members, individuals, and social organizations that support the struggle of the working class that do not belong to the World Federation of Trade Unions.

The management and supervision of the fund will be carried out by a council designated by the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

The fund's activities will be carried out openly.
