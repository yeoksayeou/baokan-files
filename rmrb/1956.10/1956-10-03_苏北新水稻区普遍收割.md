    Subei's Newly Established Rice Region Undergoing Universal Harvest
    (Our Newspaper reports) The newly established rice region in northern Jiangsu this year has now generally begun harvesting. Southward from the Subei Irrigation Main Canal, including the four special districts of Yangzhou, Yancheng, Huaiyin, and Nantong, over 1.7 million mu of dry land were planted with rice for the first time this year. Now, tens of thousands of male and female commune members on the Subei Plain are joyfully harvesting rice. The per-mu yield of over 2,000 mu of Nantee No. 1 rice in Binhai County reached 300 jin, exceeding the yield of dryland crops by about one and a half times. In the Nantong area, 300,000 mu of cotton fields were converted to rice cultivation, with an average yield of over 400 jin. In low-lying areas such as Dongtai, which originally could not be planted with crops at all in the case of heavy rainfall this year, the average yield has reached more than 200 jin per mu after switching to rice cultivation. This year, 660,000 mu of dry land in the Yancheng Special District were converted into paddy fields, and it is estimated that grain production will increase by more than 79.2 million jin, which is equivalent to the total output of dryland crops grown on these lands last year.
    Converting dry land to paddy fields is one of the effective measures to increase production in the Subei area and has been the wish of farmers for decades. In the past, these areas were prone to both drought and flooding, and the yield per unit area was only 150 jin. After the harnessing of the Huai River, the water conservancy conditions have fundamentally changed, making it possible to grow rice. After these areas achieved agricultural cooperation last year, large-scale farmland water conservancy projects were built. This spring, farmers dug countless spider web-like canals and rivers to divert water for rice cultivation. In the process of conversion, many Party committees in Yangzhou, Yancheng, and other places also established special organizations to lead farmers to convert dry land into paddy fields and trained a large number of farmer technicians to impart advanced technologies so that farmers who had never grown rice before could learn to grow rice. This area, which used to be a place of "thin soup with purslane and garlic, half a year of sweet potatoes to fill the stomach," is about to become a new "granary" of Jiangsu Province.

### 苏北新水稻区普遍收割

    苏北新水稻区普遍收割
    本报讯　江苏北部今年新诞生的水稻区，目前已经普遍开始收割。从苏北灌溉总渠向南包括扬州、盐城、淮阴、南通四个专区的一百七十多万亩旱田今年第一次种上了水稻。现在，苏北平原上成千上万的男女社员们，正满怀着喜悦收割水稻。滨海县二千多亩南特号水稻，每亩产量达三百斤，超过旱谷产量一倍半左右。南通地区三十万亩棉田改种水稻，平均产量在四百斤以上。像东台等低洼地区，本来在今年多雨的情况下，根本不能种庄稼，现在改种了水稻，平均每亩可以收到二百多斤。盐城专区今年有六十六万亩旱田改水田，预计能增产七千九百二十多万斤粮食，相当于去年这些土地生长旱谷的总产量。
    旱田改水田，这是苏北地区有效的增产措施之一，也是农民几十年来的愿望。过去，这些地区一向易旱易涝，单位面积产量只有一百五十斤。治理淮河后，水利条件有了根本改变，具备了种水稻的条件；去年这些地区实现了农业合作化以后，又大规模地兴修了农田水利。今年春天，农民们便开凿了无数蛛网般的渠道和河流，引水种水稻。在改制过程中，扬州、盐城等地许多党委还成立了专门机构领导农民把旱田改水田，并训练了大批农民技术员，传授先进技术，使从未种过水稻的农民学会种水稻。这个一向是“稀汤芦秫搭小蒜，半年山芋填肚皮”的地方，就要成为江苏省的一个新的“米粮仓”了。
