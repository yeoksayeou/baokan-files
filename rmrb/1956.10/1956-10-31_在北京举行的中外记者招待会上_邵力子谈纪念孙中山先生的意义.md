Xinhua News Agency, October 30th. Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the 90th Anniversary of the Birth of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, stated at a press conference held in Beijing with Chinese and foreign journalists today that Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a great pioneer of democratic revolution, and his ideals have been realized today. The liberated Chinese people, with reverence, are preparing to solemnly commemorate his ninetieth birthday.

The press conference was held this afternoon at the CPPCC Auditorium in Beijing. Shao Lizi introduced the preparations for the commemorative activities. He especially discussed the significance of the Chinese people solemnly commemorating this great revolutionary, Sun Yat-sen. He said that the general trend today is that people of all countries in the world are striving for an era of peace, democracy, and socialism in different ways. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong efforts were aimed at pursuing the lofty ideal of a world commonwealth. His Principle of People's Livelihood contained socialist ideas, and his "Industrial Plan" was a plan for national industrialization, advocating that the main means of production should be owned by the state.

Shao Lizi also said that commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen is also of great significance for promoting world peace. Shao Lizi spoke about Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ideas on peace, quoting Mr. Sun's famous remarks on striving for peace in his declaration upon assuming the post of Provisional President in January 1912 and in his speech when he resigned as Provisional President in April of the same year. He said that until Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death, China had not yet achieved peace, and at that time he shouted the slogan: "Struggle for peace to save China." Shao Lizi said that "Struggle for peace" is needed not only by China but also by the whole world.

Shao Lizi also mentioned that Mr. Sun Yat-sen, throughout his revolutionary activities, consistently devoted himself to improving the living standards of the people and promoting cultural exchanges among countries around the world. He said that our country has made great achievements in these areas today, and we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen, demanding that we continue to make greater and better achievements in these areas.

Shao Lizi concluded by saying that the ideals pursued by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, which were not realized in the past, have been realized today, but we still need to continue to work hard and move forward. This is why we, in the seventh year after the founding of the new China—his ninetieth birthday—will commemorate him among all the Chinese people and widely invite foreign friends and overseas Chinese to join us.

A reporter asked which countries' friends were being invited to China for this commemoration.

Shao Lizi said that we have sent invitations to friends from more than twenty countries. Many people who had connections with Mr. Sun Yat-sen and representatives of many national peace and friendship organizations have been invited, including friends from Britain and the United States.

Reporters asked whether, in order to promote national unity, people from Taiwan would also be invited to return to participate in the commemoration.

Shao Lizi said that we have such a plan. We plan to broadcast on the radio, widely calling on Kuomintang members in Taiwan and scattered overseas to return to participate in the commemoration. Whoever is willing to return, we welcome them.

    在北京举行的中外记者招待会上
    邵力子谈纪念孙中山先生的意义
    新华社30日讯　孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念筹备委员会秘书长邵力子今天在中外记者招待会上说，孙中山先生是一位伟大的民主主义革命先行者，他的理想今天已经实现。解放了的中国人民怀着崇敬的心情，准备在他的九十诞辰隆重举行纪念。
    记者招待会今天下午在北京政协礼堂举行。邵力子介绍了纪念活动的筹备情况。他特别谈到中国人民隆重纪念孙中山这位伟大的革命家的重要意义。他说，今天的形势总的趋向是世界各国人民都在用不同的方式来争取和平民主与社会主义的时代，孙中山先生毕生的努力是为了追求一个世界大同的崇高的理想，他的民生主义包含有社会主义思想，他的“实业计划”就是国家工业化的计划，主张主要生产资料归国家所有。
    邵力子又说，为了促进世界和平，我们纪念孙中山先生也有很重大的意义。邵力子谈到孙中山先生的和平思想，他引述了中山先生在1912年1月就任临时大总统的宣言和同年4月他卸任临时大总统的演说里关于争取和平的著名言论。他说，直到中山先生临终时，中国国内还没有取得和平，当时他喊出一句口号：“和平奋斗救中国”。邵力子说，“和平奋斗”不仅中国需要，全世界也需要。
    邵力子还谈到，孙中山先生在一生革命活动中，一贯致力于提高人民的生活水平和促进世界各国文化交流的事业。他说，今天我们的国家在这些方面已经做出了很大的成绩，我们纪念孙中山先生，要求在这些方面继续做出更大、更好的成绩来。
    邵力子最后说，孙中山先生所追求的理想，过去没有实现的，今天实现了，但是，我们还需要继续努力前进。这就是为什么我们要在新中国成立后的第七年——他的九十诞辰，在全中国人民中，并且广泛邀请外国朋友和海外华侨一同来纪念他的原因。
    有记者问这次纪念准备邀请那些国家的朋友来中国。
    邵力子说，我们已向二十几个国家的朋友发出了邀请，许多同孙中山先生有关系的人以及许多国家和平友好团体的代表都被邀请，包括英国和美国的朋友在内。
    记者们问，是否为了促进全国团结，也要邀请台湾的人士回来参加纪念。
    邵力子说，我们有这样的计划，我们准备在电台广播，普遍号召台湾以及散居在海外的国民党员回来参加纪念，无论是谁，愿意回来的，我们都表示欢迎。
