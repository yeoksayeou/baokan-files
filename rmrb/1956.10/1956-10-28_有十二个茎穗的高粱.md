Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Sorghum with multiple stalks and ears from a single root has appeared in the fields of the Baoshan Agricultural Cooperative in Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province. This sorghum grows four to five, and in some cases up to twelve, stalks and ears from a single root. The height, thickness of the stalks, size of the ears, and size of the grains are not significantly different from those of ordinary sorghum.

    The seeds of this sorghum were brought back by Hu Wenran, a member of the cooperative, last winter from Jiangjiatun, Heishan County, Liaoning Province. This spring, members of the Baoshan Agricultural Cooperative planted several hundred plants using a equidistant spot-planting method with one-meter spacing. By autumn, all of them had grown into multi-stalk and multi-ear sorghum. According to Gao He, a member who participated in the planting, the sorghum had only one stalk when it sprouted. When the seedlings grew to about one chi (approximately 1/3 meter) in height, they seemed to temporarily stop growing, and many new seedlings grew from the roots around the base of the stem. The new seedlings quickly caught up with the middle seedling.

    It is estimated that one hectare of such sorghum can yield 15,000 jin (7,500 kg).

    有十二个茎穗的高粱
    据新华社讯　一种一根多茎多穗高粱，出现在黑龙江省绥化县宝山农业社的田地里。这种高粱在一个根上长出四、五个，最多十二个茎秆和穗子。它们茎秆的高矮粗细，穗子和子粒的大小，和一般高粱没有显著的差别。
    这种高粱种子是这个社社员胡文然去年冬天从辽宁省黑山县姜家屯带回来的。今年春天，宝山农业社社员用一公尺宽的等距点种法种了几百棵，到秋天全部长成为多茎多穗的高粱。据参加种植的社员高和说，高粱出苗的时候，只有一个茎秆。在苗子长到一尺左右高的时候，似乎暂时停止生长，在苗茎周围的根部上，长出了许多新苗。新苗迅速地赶上了中间的苗子。
    据推算，一公顷这样的高粱可以收一万五千斤。
