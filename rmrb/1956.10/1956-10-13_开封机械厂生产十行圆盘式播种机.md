Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th. The state-owned Kaifeng Machinery Plant has begun mass production of horse-drawn ten-row disc seed drills in October. It is expected that by the end of April next year, this factory will produce 6,340 of these seed drills.

　　The ten-row disc seed drill is a relatively advanced new type of animal-powered farm tool. It is several times larger than a double-wheel double-shared plow. The structure is also much more complex. Driven by two oxen, this machine can sow more than 60 mu of farmland in eight hours.

　　From June 1949 to the present, the Kaifeng Machinery Plant has successively produced old-style farm tools such as hoes and mattocks, as well as new-style farm tools such as Liberation-type waterwheels, new-style walking plows, and double-wheel double-shared plows. After completing the production of this animal-powered farm tool, the ten-row disc seed drill, the factory will begin mass production of highly efficient, machine-driven large-scale farm tools such as winnowing machines, threshing machines, and seed selectors from May next year. In order to prepare for the trial production of the new machines, the factory has sent people to relevant departments in Jiamusi, Beijing, and other places, as well as the Northeast State-owned Friendship Farm, to contact them for samples or drawings.

    开封机械厂生产十行圆盘式播种机
    新华社郑州10日电　地方国营开封机械厂，从10月份起大量生产马拉的十行圆盘式播种机。预计到明年4月底止，这个工厂就将生产出这种播种机六千三百四十部。
    十行圆盘式播种机是一种比较高级的新式畜力农具。它的体积比双轮双铧犁大好几倍。结构也复杂得多。用两头牛带动这种机器，八小时就可以播种农田六十多亩。
    开封机械厂从1949年6月到现在，曾先后生产过锄头、镢头等旧式农具和解放式水车、新式步犁、双轮双铧犁等新式农具。这个工厂在完成十行圆盘式播种机这种畜力农具的生产以后，从明年5月份起就要大量生产效率很高的、机器带动的大型农具——扬场机、脱粒机、选种机等。为了作好新机器的试制准备工作，工厂已经派人到佳木斯、北京等地的有关部门和东北国营友谊农场接洽样品或测绘图纸。
