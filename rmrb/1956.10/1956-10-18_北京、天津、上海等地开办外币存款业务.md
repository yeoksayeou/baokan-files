Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The People's Bank of China and the Bank of China will simultaneously launch foreign currency deposit business in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen and Shantou starting today.

According to the foreign currency deposit regulations formulated by the Bank of China, Chinese enterprises and organizations abroad, foreign nationals, overseas Chinese and compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao can remit money to China to open Type A or Type B foreign currency deposit accounts; foreign diplomatic missions or organizations in China, as well as diplomatic officials, can also open Type A or Type B foreign currency deposit accounts. Enterprises, organizations and individuals in China can open Type B foreign currency deposit accounts.

The regulations stipulate the deposit and withdrawal methods for Type A and Type B foreign currency deposits: After foreign exchange is deposited into a Type A foreign currency deposit account, the original currency can be withdrawn and remitted abroad or taken out of the country without the need for approval from the government's foreign exchange management department; after foreign exchange is deposited into a Type B foreign currency deposit account, the original foreign exchange can also be withdrawn and remitted abroad or taken out of the country after being approved by the domestic foreign exchange management department. If either type of deposit is converted into Renminbi, it can be exchanged at any time at the exchange rate on the day of withdrawal at the People's Bank of China or the Bank of China. Regarding deposit and withdrawal methods, the People's Bank of China, in order to facilitate depositors abroad, stipulates that they can entrust domestic banks or other reliable individuals in China to handle deposit, withdrawal and other matters on their behalf. Domestic banks will not charge any handling fees when handling these matters on behalf of depositors. If depositors believe that it is not appropriate to use the entrusted agency method, they can agree with the deposit bank to adopt other withdrawal methods.

The foreign currencies that can be deposited into Type A and Type B foreign currency deposits are Rubles (handled by the People's Bank of China), Pounds Sterling, Swiss Francs, and Hong Kong Dollars. Hong Kong Dollar cash can be deposited into Type B foreign currency deposit accounts, while cash of the other three foreign currencies will not be accepted.

Both Type A and Type B foreign currency deposits are divided into current and fixed deposits. Type A and Type B foreign currency deposits are subject to the same interest rates. The annual interest rate for current deposits is 1.5%, the annual interest rate for fixed deposits of six months is 3.5%, and the annual interest rate for one year or more is 4%.
