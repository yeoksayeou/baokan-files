Strengthen Leadership Over Mass Fisheries

Before liberation, the highest annual output of aquatic products in China was 1.5 million tons in 1936. In 1949, when the country was liberated, the annual output was only 440,000 tons. In the years following liberation, output increased year by year, reaching 2.52 million tons in 1955, greatly exceeding the highest annual output in the past.

Of this total output of 2.52 million tons, mass fisheries accounted for over 91%. Among the 4.5 million fishermen in China, 1.5 million are engaged in production. They own approximately 440,000 fishing boats of various sizes and have rich experience. They play a significant role in supplying non-staple foods to urban and rural areas. These millions of fishermen have now basically realized cooperation.

Although fishermen's production has achieved such results, the leadership work for their production has been insufficient.

Aquatic work lacks overall planning and reasonable arrangements. In the past, aquatic departments often favored the development of state-owned enterprises while neglecting the development of mass fisheries. Undoubtedly, state-owned enterprises must be developed gradually as much as possible; however, it is obviously wrong to only pay attention to state-owned enterprises while neglecting mass fisheries, which account for over 91% of production. There are still many problems in mass fisheries; most of their fishing gear and methods are very backward; we have not effectively summarized and promoted the advanced experiences among them, and made possible improvements in technology. In the past, aquatic departments also focused on marine production while neglecting freshwater fisheries, which affected the development of freshwater fisheries, and the vast inland water resources have not been fully utilized. In addition, whether in marine or freshwater fisheries, more attention is paid to fishing than to aquaculture, and the supply of fish fry and the prevention and treatment of fish diseases have not been seriously studied and resolved; resource breeding and protection have not attracted the attention of various regions, resulting in serious damage to resources in some areas due to poisoning, explosions, or indiscriminate fishing of parent fish and fry.

There are also many shortcomings in supply and marketing, pricing, and taxation. Many supply and marketing personnel have a purely profit-oriented view; although purchase and sales plans cannot be completed, profit plans are overfulfilled. The general situation is that the purchase price of fish is too low. For example, the purchase price in Guangdong has been declining year by year, decreasing by 10%-20% this year compared to last year; in Fujian Province, the price of marine economic fish has decreased by two yuan per dan (unit of weight) this year compared to last year. However, the supply price of production materials for fishermen has increased. For example, the price of major fishing supplies in Zhejiang has increased by 30%-60% this year; this problem has also occurred widely in Liaoning, Shandong, Guangdong, Fujian, and other provinces. This has a great impact on the production enthusiasm of fishermen. In terms of taxation, some regions still retain some unreasonable fishing taxes, some even collecting as many as five times, which also increases the burden on fishermen. In addition, the reduction in fishery production in the first half of this year has made the lives of some fishermen quite difficult, some even having to rely on government relief funds to survive.

The organization of fishery cooperatives in some areas is very unsound, management is poor, finances are chaotic, and some cooperatives excessively emphasize the accumulation of public welfare funds or have extravagant waste phenomena. These all hinder the increase of fishermen's actual income and internal unity. In some aquatic areas, where fisheries account for a large proportion, fishery cooperatives could have been organized, but they were forcibly merged into agricultural cooperatives. Many cooperatives that combine agriculture and fisheries have not properly coordinated agriculture and fisheries, even mobilizing fishermen to switch to other occupations and lowering fishery work points; the leadership has transferred the original aquatic cadres and failed to provide fishermen with production materials in a timely manner. In some areas, the establishment and rectification of cooperatives were not combined with production, which delayed the fishing season. In Jiangsu Province, more than half of the 26,000 fishing boats could not start production in time this year.

In order to utilize all available aquatic resources as much as possible, rapidly develop aquatic undertakings to increase the income of fishermen and farmers, improve the lives of fishermen and farmers, and gradually adapt to the growing needs of the people for aquatic products, in addition to striving to develop state-owned fisheries, we must greatly strengthen the leadership and assistance to mass fisheries.

In accordance with the spirit of the division of labor between the central and local governments, the leadership responsibility of local aquatic departments at all levels for mass fisheries will be even greater in the future. The Ministry of Aquatic Products has been established under the Central Government, and local governments at all levels should also consider the actual situation, set up corresponding institutions and allocate necessary staff to strengthen the leadership of mass fisheries.

It is necessary to take various measures to fully mobilize the production enthusiasm of fishermen. Fishery cooperatives that are not yet soundly organized should be rectified and consolidated, and management should be improved according to the principles of voluntary mutual benefit, diligence and thrift in running the cooperative, democratic operation, and less deduction and more distribution. Fishermen's cooperatives should reasonably stipulate the distribution system and labor remuneration based on the principle of distribution according to work. Under the policy of developing diversified economies, agricultural cooperatives in areas with suitable conditions should list fisheries as one of the important side occupations, make full use of aquatic resources, and increase farmers' income. In terms of supply and marketing, the main task is to reduce operating links and reasonably adjust the purchase price of fish and the supply price of fishing supplies. In areas with numerous tax items and heavy burdens on fishermen, consideration should also be given to appropriately reducing burdens.

The public welfare funds of cooperatives should be used to expand reproduction, build large fishing boats, and improve fishing gear. However, some fishery cooperatives are currently facing difficulties, and relevant government departments should provide assistance by issuing fishery loans. Fishery loans should be an independent item, with a certain amount allocated to ensure that the funds are used for their intended purpose.

The aquatic departments should resolve some other existing problems and the work that should be done as soon as possible, and gradually establish technical extension stations according to needs and possible conditions, set up necessary production guidance boats on the water surface, summarize and promote the advanced experiences of the masses, publicize scientific knowledge, and help the masses improve aquaculture and fishing techniques to increase production.

In the past, some cadres one-sidedly believed that aquatic products were only a kind of non-staple food, accounting for a small proportion in the entire national economy, and neglected the important relationship between aquatic undertakings and the economy, national defense, and people's lives, as well as the full possibility and necessity of utilizing the vast aquatic resources. They did not understand that China not only has the unlimited resources of the vast ocean, but also 6.8 million mu (unit of area) of sea surface available for aquaculture, and 160 million mu of inland water surface available for fishing and aquaculture, 80-90% of which have not yet been utilized, and several hundred million mu of paddy fields and an increasing number of reservoirs, most of which are suitable for fish farming. These are all rich treasures of the country, which urgently need to be developed and utilized to meet social needs and support socialist industrialization. Therefore, Party and government organs and aquatic management departments at all levels must strengthen aquatic work, especially strengthening the leadership of mass fisheries in all aspects.

### 加强对群众渔业的领导

　　加强对群众渔业的领导
    我国水产在解放前的最高年产量是1936年的一百五十万吨。在1949年全国解放的时候，年产量只有四十四万吨。解放后几年来，产量逐年有所增长，1955年已经达到二百五十二万吨，大大超过了过去最高的年产量。
    在这二百五十二万吨总产量中，群众渔业产量占91％以上。在我国渔民总人口四百五十万中，有劳动力从事生产的是一百五十万人。他们拥有大小渔船约四十四万艘，有丰富的经验。他们对城乡副食品供应，起了相当大的作用。这几百万渔民，现在基本上已经实现了合作化。
    渔民生产虽然有这样的成绩，但对他们的生产的领导工作，却做得很不够。
    水产工作缺乏全面规划和合理的安排。过去，水产部门往往偏重发展国营企业，而相当忽视发展群众渔业。毫无疑问，国营企业必须尽可能地逐步发展；可是，只注意国营而忽视占生产量91％以上的群众渔业，显然是错误的。现在群众渔业中的问题还很多；他们的鱼具和捕鱼法大部分非常落后；我们没有很好地总结并推广他们中间的先进经验，在技术方面加以可能的改进。过去，水产部门又偏重海洋生产，而相当忽视淡水渔业，因而影响到淡水渔业的发展，广大的内陆水面资源未能充分利用。此外，无论在海洋或淡水渔业中，注意捕捞方面多，注意养殖方面少，对鱼苗的供应和鱼病的防治等问题也没有认真研究解决；资源的繁殖保护还没有引起各地的注意，以致有些地区投毒、爆炸或滥捕亲鱼子鱼，损害资源的情况十分严重。
    在供销、物价和税收工作等方面也有不少的缺点。许多供销工作人员有单纯利润观点，购销计划虽不能完成，却超额完成了利润计划。一般的情况是鱼货收购价格偏低。如广东收购价逐年下降，今年比去年降低10％—20％；福建省海产经济鱼类价格今年比去年每担减少二元。对渔民生产资料的供应价却提高了。如浙江今年主要渔需物资价格涨了30％—60％；辽宁、山东、广东、福建等省也普遍地发生了这个问题。这对渔民的生产积极性有很大的影响。在税收方面，有些地区还保存着一些不合理的渔税，有的竟征收了五次之多，这也使渔民负担加重。加上今年上半年渔业减产，使部分渔民的生活陷于相当困难的境地，有的甚至要靠政府的救济金过活。
    有些地区的渔业合作社的组织很不健全，经营管理不善，财务紊乱，有些社过分强调积累公积金，或者发生了铺张浪费的现象。这些都妨碍了渔民实际收入的增加和内部的团结。有些水产区域，渔业比重大，原可组织渔业合作社，却被硬性地并入农业合作社了。不少渔农合并的合作社没有把农业和渔业适当地配合起来，甚至动员渔民转业，压低渔业工分；领导方面调走了原有的水产干部，不适时供给渔民生产资料。有些地区在建社整社期间没有同生产相结合，以致耽误了渔汛季节。江苏省两万六千艘渔船，今年不能及时生产的达半数以上。
    为了尽可能利用一切可以利用的水产资源，迅速发展水产事业以增加渔民和农民的收入，改善渔民和农民的生活，并逐步适应人民对水产品日益增长的需要，除了努力发展国营渔业以外，必须大大加强对群众渔业的领导和帮助。
    按照中央和地方分工的精神，各级地方水产部门对于群众渔业的领导责任今后将更加重大。中央水产部已经成立，各级地方政府也应该斟酌实际情况，设置相应的机构和配备必要的工作人员，加强对群众渔业的领导。
    要采取各项措施，充分发挥渔民的生产积极性。渔业合作社的组织还不健全的，应当整顿巩固，按自愿互利，勤俭办社，民主办社，少扣多分等原则改善经营管理。渔民合作社应根据按劳取酬的原则，合理地规定分配制度和劳动报酬。在发展多种经济的方针下，在有条件的地区，农业合作社应该把渔业列为重要的副业之一，充分利用水产资源，增加农民收入。在供销工作方面，主要是减少经营环节，合理地调整渔货的收购价和渔需物资的供应价。在税目繁多、渔民负担过重的地区，也应考虑适当减轻负担。
    合作社的公积金要用于扩大再生产，建造大型渔船，改善渔具。但目前有的渔业社还有困难，政府有关部门应酌发渔业贷款加以援助。渔贷应成为一个独立项目，划出一定的数额，保证专款专用。
    对一些目前存在的其它问题和应做的工作，水产部门应尽速解决，并根据需要和可能条件，逐步设立技术推广站，在水面设置必要的生产指导船，总结和推广群众的先进经验，宣传科学知识，帮助群众提高养殖和捕捞的技术，增加生产。
    过去有些干部片面地认为水产只是一种副食品，在整个国民经济中比重不大，而忽视了水产事业同经济、国防和人民生活等方面的重大关系，以及利用广大水产富源的充分可能性和必要性。他们不了解我国不但有广阔海洋的无限资源，还有可供养殖的海面六百八十万亩，内陆有可供捕捞和养殖的水面一亿六千万亩，其中十之八九还未被利用，另有数亿亩水田和日益增多的水库，大多宜于养殖鱼类。这都是国家的丰富宝藏，亟待开发利用，以适应社会需要并支持社会主义工业化建设。因此，各级党政机关和水产管理部门一定要加强水产工作，特别是从各方面加强对群众渔业的领导。
