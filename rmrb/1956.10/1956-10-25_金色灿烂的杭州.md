    Golden, Brilliant Hangzhou
    Yequ
    The scorching and stormy long summer is over, and beautiful autumn has arrived. The wind is warm, and the sun is gentle and kind. The sky is so high on sunny days, the air is so fresh, and the earth presents all kinds of colors. What wonderful weather, neither cold nor hot.

    On Sundays, just like in spring, people flock to the lake, the lakeside, the suburbs, and scenic spots: Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, Huxin Pavilion, Yuquan, Lingyin, Longjing, Hupao, Jiuxi, Liuhe Pagoda... by both land and water. The lake water is deep and clear, and the boats seem to glide over oiled ground, the water barely rippling. In the air, in the breeze, drifts a quiet and sweet fragrance. Even if you search everywhere, it's hard to immediately find the golden and silver osmanthus blossoms hidden here and there among the lush green leaves in front of people's houses, in the lakeside parks, at the foot of the mountains, on the mountains, and by the roadside! Noble, simple, and detached flowers!

    Deeply nestled in osmanthus groves is Manjuelong – Hangzhou's famous osmanthus village. Along the clean cobblestone paths of the village, the homes of the members of the May 1st Agricultural Production Cooperative are scattered. This cooperative is now also an outstanding production cooperative in the suburbs, capable of careful calculations and flexibly developing a variety of diverse sideline productions according to local conditions, increasing the income of the members. At this time, osmanthus chestnuts have just come onto the market, and every tourist who comes to Manjuelong is eager to buy some to take home. Soon, osmanthus candy will also be available. Osmanthus candy will be sold throughout the country.

    The sunset glow rises from the top of the mountain, but the sun is still reluctant to leave. The city, the lake, and the earth are suddenly shrouded in a brilliant golden light. The golden late rice, soon to be harvested, looks even more golden, and the red persimmons, soon to be picked, look even redder. Cooking smoke rises from the valleys, drifting like spring gossamer.

    These beautiful days evoke beautiful memories! When my footsteps traveled from east to west, and from west to east, never knowing fatigue, I crossed high mountains and oceans to question those beautiful cities and villages, to question those people with beautiful souls.

    Ah! I praise these beautiful days! Peaceful days! I also bless the people living in the golden and brilliant towns! And those who live and work for the happiness of mankind!

    金色灿烂的杭州
    野渠
    赤日炎炎的长夏、多暴风雨的长夏过去了，美丽的秋天已经到来，风是暖的，太阳是温和可亲的。晴天是这么高，空气是这么新鲜，大地上呈现出各种各样的颜色。多么美妙的天气，不冷也不热。
    星期天，像春天一样，人们涌向湖上、湖边、郊区和风景区，三潭印月、湖心亭、玉泉、灵隐、龙井、虎跑、九溪、六和塔……水陆并用。湖水深深的，清清的，划子好像在涂着油的地面上滑过去，水波不兴。空气里、微风中，飘来一股幽静而甜蜜的香味，即使四处找寻，也很难立时发见隐没在这里那里，人家的屋前、湖滨公园里、山下、山上、路边，藏在碧绿叶子中的金色和银色的桂花！高贵的、朴素而又淡泊的花！
    深深地埋在桂花丛中的满觉垅——杭州闻名的桂花村，沿着村中洁净的石子路的两旁，稀稀落落地居住着五一农业生产合作社的社员家。这个社现在也是郊区出色的一个生产合作社，社里能够精打细算，灵活地因地制宜地发展多种多样的副业生产，使社员们增加了收入。这时候桂花栗子刚上市，来到满觉垅的游人，没有一个不是争着买些桂花栗子回家去。不久，桂花糖又要应市了。桂花糖将运销全国呢。
    晚霞从山顶升起，太阳却还恋恋不去。城市、湖上和大地突然被一片灿烂的金色笼罩着。快要收割的金黄色的晚稻显得更金黄了，快要采摘的红柿显得更鲜红了。炊烟从山谷中升起，袅袅地像春天的游丝。
    这美丽的日子引起了我美丽的回忆！当我的足迹从东到西，从西到东，还不知道什么是疲乏，我曾跨过高山，越过大海，去叩问那些美丽的城市和乡村，去叩问那些有着美丽的灵魂的人们。
    呀！我赞美这美丽的日子！恬静的日子！我也祝福生活在金色灿烂的城镇中的人们！和为着人类幸福而生活着、工作着的人们！
