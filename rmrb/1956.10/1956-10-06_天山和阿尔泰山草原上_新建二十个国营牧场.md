Xinhua News Agency News: In Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, twenty of the twenty-two local state-run ranches planned for establishment this year have now been completed. The other two will also be completed before winter.

The newly built state-run ranches include two fine-wool sheep farms, seven sheep farms, five horse farms, five cattle farms, and a pig farm in the Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County. These ranches have a total of more than 190,000 head of livestock of various kinds. Together with the original nineteen local state-run ranches and the ranches and farms operated by the Production and Construction Corps, the number of state-owned livestock in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region now accounts for more than 5% of the total number of livestock in the entire autonomous region.

The newly built state-run ranches are mainly distributed on the grasslands of the Tianshan and Altai Mountains. Each ranch has been equipped with some breeding sires, and some medicated bathing pools, artificial insemination rooms for sheep, and office and living quarters have been built. Nearly 9,000 mu of wasteland have also been reclaimed and sown with feed crops such as oats and corn. Sheds for all breeding sires, productive dams, and weak livestock to spend the winter are being built.

Each state-run ranch is equipped with a small number of ethnic minority animal husbandry, veterinary, and agricultural technical cadres, many of whom are young students who graduated from the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department of Xinjiang Nationalities Institute this summer.
