    九龙地区全部解除戒严令
    部分暴徒已逃匿澳门
    新华社广州16日电　香港消息：今日上午十时以后，九龙地区已全部解除戒严令，受暴徒袭击最重的郊区荃湾地区也已解除戒严。
    九龙方面的官立学校已在今晨开始复课。深水埗一带的渡海小轮从今晨八时起复航。由九龙佐敦道开往郊区元朗和荃湾的公共汽车，也在十时以后开出。香港各银行的九龙分行，今日已开始营业。
    据15日“星岛晚报”的消息说，15日晨在九龙裁判署四个法庭审讯的四八三名九龙区骚乱时期所拘捕的人犯中，有四五三人被控告破坏戒严令，他们被判处六周或两个月的监禁，而被控告在深水埗地区暴动和非法集结的有三十人。
    但是，至今没有听说捕到一个肇事的国民党特务分子。而据昨晚来自澳门的消息说，日来已有几十个国民党特务分子和黑社会人物从九龙逃到澳门藏匿，他们当中有些人曾在澳门的赌场露面。
