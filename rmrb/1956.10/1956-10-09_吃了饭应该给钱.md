    You Should Pay After Eating
    The Huheletai Pastoral Society of Chen Barag Banner, Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, is the earliest pastoral production cooperative established in the entire region. The society has achieved good production results, so many people come to visit and work. From July of last year to June of this year, the society's production management expenses totaled 279 yuan, but the entertainment expenses used up 308 yuan.
    This year, in addition to one or two guests constantly staying at the homes of the society members, a total of 425 people came to visit, 17 people came to work at the society, and 15 were newspaper reporters. There were a total of 1,427 person-days. Some of these people paid after eating, while others did not pay for their meals. Where does this expense come from? It can only come from the labor income of the pastoral society members.
    Therefore, I suggest that in the future, staff members going to the countryside should pay for whoever's food they eat.

    吃了饭应该给钱
    内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔陈巴尔虎旗胡和勒泰牧业社，是全区最早成立的牧业生产合作社。这个社生产成绩很好，因此，前来参观的、工作的人员很多。从去年7月到今年6月，该社生产管理费一共开支了二百七十九元，可是招待费却用掉三百零八元。
    今年该社除了社员们家里不断住一两位客人外，先后来参观的共有四百二十五人，来社工作的十七人，报社记者有十五人。总共有一千四百二十七个人日。这些人，有的吃了饭给了钱；有的人吃了饭钱也不给。这笔费用哪里来呢？只好由牧业社社员们的劳动收入中出了。
    因此，我建议今后下乡的工作人员，吃了谁的饭，一律要给钱。
