Your Excellency, Friends:

　　Seventeen days ago, I arrived in your country, and it was as lively as a festival, just like now. I felt that the warm welcome you gave me, as the representative of Nepal and the Nepalese people, was like it happened just yesterday. Today, everyone looks just as happy. We are very happy with our visit to China, but neither I nor my friends are as happy as we were seventeen days ago, because we keep thinking about parting with you. No one can feel calm when parting with his dear friends, especially us, because I think you are our dearest friends and our closest brothers. The connection between us is so deep and intimate that its foundation is a spiritual brotherhood. I can say with certainty that I see today's separation as a separation between family members. This is not an illusion generated by emotional excitement. I see the present occasion as a family scene, and this view is deeply imprinted in my heart.

　　We visited China and toured part of it. Your progress has greatly exceeded our previous imagination. We especially saw the great enthusiasm and progress of the people under the leadership of the current government. In such a large country, there are certainly various kinds of people, but we see that all the Chinese people are united. They all have the goal of working hard to develop their own country. I am very satisfied with this, and the credit should go to the current Chinese government. If the Chinese people fully realize the significance contained in their such a large country and continue to unite for the development of their country, then there is no doubt that China will catch up with the world's leading developed countries.

　　We are your neighbors, and we are located between two great countries, China and India. We all hope that these two countries will help the development of our small country while developing their own countries. We always wish you well. Asians are indeed deeply satisfied to see a country that was once backward develop. We are very happy with your progress. We wholeheartedly hope for world peace so that you can continue to progress.

　　Through your friendship and hospitality to us everywhere, you have expressed your love for the Nepalese people. I have no hesitation in saying that the Nepalese people are equally friendly to the Chinese people. When I came to your country, I brought the best wishes of tens of millions of Nepalese people. Today, when I return, I am bringing the friendship of 600 million Chinese people to my people. I think this is the biggest achievement of my visit to China.

　　Of course, we meet and part for a while, but the friendship between China and Nepal is eternal. Therefore, I will not say goodbye to you, I will only say "goodbye" and "hello," and hope that we will meet again.

　　Long live the friendship between China and Nepal!

### 阿查里雅首相在广州车站上的讲话

    阿查里雅首相在广州车站上的讲话阁下、朋友们：
    十七天以前我到了贵国，当时也和现在一样，像节日般的热闹。我感觉到，当时你们给作为尼泊尔和尼泊尔人民代表的我热烈的欢迎，就像发生在昨天一样。今天大家看起来也是一样的愉快。我们对我们的访华旅行很高兴，但是我和我的朋友们都没有十七天以前那样心情愉快，因为我们一直在想我们就要同你们分别了。任何人也不能够在同他的亲爱的朋友分别时感到平静，特别是我们，因为我认为你们是我们最亲爱的朋友，而且也是我们最亲密的兄弟。我们之间的联系是如此之深切亲密，以致它的基础是精神上兄弟关系。我肯定说，我把今天的分别，看为家庭成员之间分别这并不是一个在激动情绪产生的假想，我把现在场合看成一个家庭的场面，这种看法是深深的印在我的心里的。
    我们访问了中国并参观了它的一部分，你们的进步大大地超过了我们以前的想像。我们特别看到了在现在政府领导之下的人民的巨大热情和他们的进步。在这样一个大国里，当然有各种不同的人物，但我们看到所有的中国人民都是团结的。他们都有为发展自己祖国而努力的目标。我对此深为满意，而这个功劳应属于现在的中国政府。如果中国人民充分地认识到他们这样一个大国所包含的意义，并且继续为了他们国家的发展而团结一致，那么毫无疑问，中国会赶上世界上头等发达的国家。
    我们是你们的邻国，我们处在两个伟大国家中国和印度之间。我们都希望这两个国家在他们发展自己国家的同时，也帮助我们这个小国的发展。我们永远希望你们好。亚洲人看到一个从前是落后的国家发展起来，的确是深感满意的。我们对你们的进步是很高兴的。我们衷心地希望世界和平，让你们能继续不断地进步。
    你们通过你们到处对我们的友好和款待，表示了你们对尼泊尔人民的友爱。我毫不迟疑地说，尼泊尔人民对中国人民也是同样友好的。当我到贵国时，我带来了千万尼泊尔人民的最好的愿望，今天当我回去的时候，我又带着六亿中国人民的友谊给我国人民。我认为这是我这次访华的最大成就。
    当然，我们是一会儿见面、一会儿又分别，但是中尼两国的友谊是永恒的。因此，我不同你们告别，我只说“再见”和“你好”，并且希望我们再次见面。
    中尼两国的友谊万岁！
