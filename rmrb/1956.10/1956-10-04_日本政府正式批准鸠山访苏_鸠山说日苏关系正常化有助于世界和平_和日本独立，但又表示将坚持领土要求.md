Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd – According to reports from Tokyo: The Japanese government officially approved Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama's visit to the Soviet Union at a cabinet meeting on the evening of the 2nd, to resume Japan-Soviet negotiations. Hatoyama will depart on the 6th.

After the cabinet meeting, Hatoyama delivered a speech saying that he was determined to visit the Soviet Union to take responsibility for restoring normal relations with the Soviet Union. He said this was a promise he had made to the Japanese people in the past. Hatoyama explained that there were three reasons for his visit to the Soviet Union: he believed that the normalization of relations between Japan and the Soviet Union would help world peace; restoring normal relations with the Soviet Union would raise Japan's international status and complete Japan's true independence; and it would enable the early repatriation of Japanese people detained in the Soviet Union.

Hatoyama also stated that in the negotiations, he would not abandon Japan's past attitude towards the southern Kuril Islands of Kunashiri and Etorofu, and would still insist on demanding that the Soviet Union transfer these two islands to Japan.

Before making the decision for Hatoyama to visit the Soviet Union, the Hatoyama government had tried its best to get the entire Liberal Democratic Party to unanimously support Hatoyama's visit. However, under the sabotage of elements opposed to restoring normal relations with the Soviet Union, the meetings of all Liberal Democratic Party Diet members convened for this purpose repeatedly failed.

Under these circumstances, the cabinet meeting specifically pointed out that Hatoyama should respect the new resolution recently passed by the Liberal Democratic Party when negotiating with the Soviet Union. The content of this resolution is: demanding that the Soviet Union immediately and unconditionally repatriate Japanese detainees; immediately "return" Shikotan Island and the Habomai Islands; continue negotiations on the issue of "returning" Kunashiri Island and Etorofu Island after the restoration of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Japan; and matters agreed upon by the two countries should be included in the agreement to be concluded. In Hatoyama's originally proposed policy for visiting the Soviet Union for negotiations, it was originally stipulated that the territorial issue should be temporarily shelved, and efforts should first be made to restore diplomatic relations between the two countries.

The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement on the 2nd, supporting Hatoyama's visit to the Soviet Union. It also requested that the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party end its internal disputes and immediately realize Hatoyama's peace mission of visiting the Soviet Union.

    日本政府正式批准鸠山访苏
    鸠山说日苏关系正常化有助于世界和平
    和日本独立，但又表示将坚持领土要求
    据新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本政府2日晚间在内阁会议上正式批准日本首相鸠山一郎访问苏联，恢复苏日谈判。鸠山将在6日启程。
    鸠山在内阁会议后发表谈话说，他决心访问苏联是为了负起同苏联恢复正常关系的责任。他说这是他在过去向日本国民作过的诺言。鸠山说明他访问苏联有三个原因：他认为，日本同苏联的关系正常化，有助于世界和平；同苏联恢复正常关系将会提高日本的国际地位，完成日本的真正独立；能够早日使被拘留在苏联的日本人获得遣返。
    鸠山还说明，他在谈判中将不放弃日本过去对千岛群岛南部的国后岛和择捉岛的态度，仍坚持要求把苏联的这两个岛屿移交给日本。
    鸠山政府在作出鸠山访苏的决定以前，曾经竭力想使自由民主党全党一致支持鸠山访苏。但是，在反对同苏联恢复正常关系的分子的破坏下，为了这个目的召集的自由民主党全体国会议员会议一再流产。
    在这种情况下，内阁会议特别指出，鸠山在同苏联谈判的时候要尊重自由民主党最近通过的新决议。这个决议的内容是：要求苏联立即并且无条件地遣返日本的被拘留者；立即“归还”色丹岛和齿舞群岛；在苏日两国恢复邦交后继续谈判“归还”国后岛和择捉岛问题；两国已经取得协议的事项要包括在准备缔结的协定中。在鸠山最初提出的赴苏谈判的方针中，原来规定暂时搁置领土问题，先设法恢复两国的邦交。
    日本社会党在2日发表声明，支持鸠山访问苏联。它并且要求日本自由民主党结束内部争吵，立即实现鸠山访苏这个和平使命。
