The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) makes several clarifications regarding teaching principles in the study of democratic personages and industrialists and businessmen.

		October 17, 1956

Recently, the provincial, autonomous region, and municipal CPPCC committees and relevant departments have been actively working based on the "Decision on Organizing Political and Theoretical Study for Democratic Personages and Industrialists and Businessmen" issued by this Committee. The enthusiasm for learning among democratic personages and industrialists and businessmen is generally high, and participation is very active. The organization of study in various places is basically good.

However, some places still have some problems in grasping the teaching principles. In accordance with the spirit of the aforementioned decision of this Committee, the following points are added for clarification:

I.

At present, the demand of democratic personages and industrialists and businessmen for strengthening study and remolding their thinking is higher than at any time in the past. Therefore, actively helping them obtain full opportunities to participate in study is absolutely necessary. However, whether to participate in study and what form of study to adopt should be decided by each individual according to the principle of voluntariness, without any coercion. Only when learning is voluntary will it be conscious, and only through conscious efforts can we truly improve ideological understanding and achieve practical learning results. Otherwise, study will not only become a formality but also a burden. The various forms of learning proposed in the aforementioned decision of this Committee are only to provide various learning opportunities for those who are willing to participate in learning, and not to require everyone to participate in learning. For those who are too old or whose health is not suitable for participating in collective study, or who cannot leave their posts due to work reasons, they should also be persuaded not to participate in study. If they wish to obtain study materials, they can be distributed appropriately; if they are willing to freely attend reports, appropriate arrangements can be made. For those who have already participated in study, if they cannot complete their studies due to health or other reasons, they can withdraw midway.

II.

The study of democratic personages and industrialists and businessmen must implement the teaching methods of free thinking and free debate, so that various opinions and questions can be freely raised and fully discussed, thereby obtaining a more thorough solution. Do not take various measures that may cause students' concerns and increase their mental burden. Some short-term training courses for industrialists and businessmen held in some places first made it clear to the students: there will be no exams, no ideological self-examinations, no study appraisals, and no writing of study summaries. The students' concerns were greatly reduced, so their enthusiasm for learning was greatly improved, and better learning results were achieved. However, in some places, ideological examinations were rigidly carried out in the study, and even transformed into disguised historical reviews. Some focused on cultivating typical examples and organizing typical speeches, creating an atmosphere among the students that they must criticize themselves in order to "pass the test." Some places have adopted methods such as signing "study covenants" and "making guarantees in public," creating a tense atmosphere. These practices are not in line with the principles of freedom and voluntariness. In the future, when organizing democratic personages and industrialists and businessmen to study, all localities must implement the spirit of the aforementioned decision of this Committee, without investigating history, without examining thoughts, without holding examinations, and without making appraisals. Regarding connecting with reality and carrying out criticism and self-criticism, it must be based on individual consciousness, and should not be forced, let alone subjectively arranged. Do not adopt methods such as signing covenants, making guarantees, cultivating typical examples, holding competitions, and selecting learning models in the study, so as to ensure that students maintain a relaxed and happy mood in the study and gradually improve their understanding.

III.

Different objects should be distinguished, and the content of teaching should be determined separately according to the length of study time and the degree that students can accept. Do not deviate from reality and make excessive or hasty demands. Ideological remolding is a long-term process. Study is an effective method of ideological remolding, but it is not the only method. Moreover, study must be practical and progressive in order to achieve practical results. Some places have attempted to "finish the job in one battle" of ideological remolding through short-term intensive study, and therefore have made excessive or hasty demands. In this way, many inappropriate practices will inevitably be adopted, and the due learning results will not be achieved. It must be noted that the cultural level and political level of those participating in the study are not the same, and there must be no forced uniformity in the content of teaching. We must take care of the degree to which they can understand, and do not create a phenomenon of excessive quantity and excessive burden. Only by grasping the key points and teaching students according to their aptitude can we avoid deviating from reality and affecting the effectiveness of teaching.

IV.

It is hoped that the local committees of the CPPCC at all levels and relevant departments will pay attention to the above items in the specific work of organizing the study of democratic personages and industrialists and businessmen, summarize experience in a timely manner, continuously improve teaching methods, and send relevant materials and experience summaries to this Committee at any time for research and promotion, so as to further improve the work of organizing the study of democratic personages and industrialists and businessmen.

    政协全国委员会就民主人士和工商业者的学习问题通知各地政协
    贯彻自愿学习、自由思考、分别对待的方针
    新华社17日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会对各界民主人士和工商业者学习中有关教学方针的几点说明。全文如下：
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会对各界民主人士和工商业者学习中有关教学方针的几点说明。
          1956年10月17日
    近来各省、自治区、市政协委员会和各有关方面根据本会发布的“关于组织各界民主人士和工商业者进行政治学习和理论学习的决定”，积极进行工作。各界民主人士和工商业者学习情绪普遍高涨，参加学习的人很踊跃。各地组织学习的情况基本上是好的。
    但是，有些地方在掌握教学方针上还存在一些问题。兹根据本会上述决定的精神，就以下各点加以补充说明：
    一
    目前，各界民主人士和工商业者对于加强学习、改造思想的要求，比过去任何时候为高。因此，积极地帮助他们获得充分的参加学习的机会是完全必要的。但是，参加学习与否和采取那种方式学习，应当按照自愿原则，由各人自己决定，不要有丝毫勉强。学习惟有是自愿的，才会是自觉的，也只有通过自觉的努力，才能真正提高思想认识，收到学习的实际效果。否则学习不仅会流于形式，而且会成为一种负担。本会上述决定中所提出的各种学习方式，只是为愿意参加学习的人士提供各种学习的机会，而不是要求每一个人都必须参加学习。对于年龄过高或者健康情况不适宜参加集体学习或者由于工作关系职务上不能离开的人士，还应当劝说他们不要参加学习。其中如有希望得到学习资料的可以适当分送；愿意自由参加听报告的可以适当安排。对于已经参加学习的人士，如果因为健康或者其他原因不能终业的，可以中途退学。
    二
    各界民主人士和工商业者的学习必须贯彻自由思考、自由辩论的教学方法，使各种见解和疑问能够自由提出和充分讨论，从而获得比较彻底的解决，不要采取那些可能引起学员的顾虑和增加他们精神负担的各种措施。有的地方举办的工商业者短期讲习班，首先向学员交代清楚：不举行考试，不搞思想检查，不搞学习鉴定，不写学习小结等，学员们的顾虑大为减少，因此，学习的积极性大为提高，从而取得了较好的学习效果。但是，也有一些地方在学习中生硬地检查思想，甚至变相地形成审查历史，有的着重培养典型，组织典型发言，在学员中造成必须批判自己，才能“过关”的空气。有的地方采取订“学习公约”、“当众提保证”等办法，造成一种紧张的气氛。这些做法，都是不符合自由、自愿的原则的。今后各地方在组织民主人士和工商业者进行学习的时候，必须贯彻本会上述决定的精神，不查历史，不查思想，不举行考试，不做鉴定。对于联系实际和开展批评与自我批评，必须依据个人的自觉，不要勉强，更不要主观地布置一套。在学习中不采取订公约、提保证和培养典型、举行竞赛、评选学习模范等办法，务使学员在学习中保持轻松愉快的情绪，逐步提高认识。
    三
    应当区别各种不同的对象，根据学习时间的长短和学员能够接受的程度，分别决定教学的内容。不要脱离实际，提出过高、过急的要求。思想改造是一个长期的过程，学习是思想改造的有效方法，但不是唯一的方法，而学习又必须切合实际，循序渐进，才能得到实际的效果。有些地方企图经过短期集中学习，将思想改造“毕其功于一役”，因而要求过高、过急。这样，就不可避免地会采取许多不恰当的作法，达不到应有的学习效果。必须注意：参加学习的人士文化水平和政治水平是不相同的，决不能在教学内容上强求一致。必须照顾他们所能理解的程度，不要造成分量过多、负担过重的现象。只有把握重点，因材施教，才不致脱离实际，影响教学的效果。
    四
    以上各项，希望各级政协地方委员会和有关方面，在组织民主人士和工商业者学习的具体工作中经常加以注意，及时总结经验，不断改进教学方法，并且随时将有关资料和经验总结寄送本会，以便研究推广，进一步搞好组织民主人士和工商业者学习的工作。
