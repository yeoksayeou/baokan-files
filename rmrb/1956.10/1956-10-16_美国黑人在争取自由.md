    American Blacks in the Struggle for Freedom
    By Kennedy, American Writer
    The struggle of American blacks for freedom has been going on for hundreds of years. They are now once again opposing their oppressors through mass struggles.
    At the same time, oppressors are resorting to increasingly vicious and brutal means of terror in an effort to perpetuate the economic, political, and social system that calls itself "white supremacy."
    More than sixteen million American blacks have decided they will no longer allow others to answer their just demands for equal rights with the word "no." The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, led by the bourgeoisie, has put forward the slogan "Freedom by 1963," but most blacks do not expect full freedom to come to them like a miracle in the next seven years. They are now urging the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to take militant action and launch resolute mass struggles on every front.
    Montgomery, Alabama, was once the capital of the Southern Confederacy of American slave owners. The militant unity displayed by the black people of this city has inspired the ideals of every American black. This form of struggle is spreading rapidly. The Montgomery bus boycott won a favorable court ruling, no less important than the Supreme Court's 1954 ruling against racial segregation in education. Recently, this type of boycott weapon has been used against the manufacturers of "Coca-Cola," who have been funding racist gangs.
    Born in the flames of the struggle against slavery, the Black church has emerged from its slumber and actively engaged in the struggle. Black leaders, shaken by the brutal murder of black child Emmett Till and inspired by the Montgomery boycott, organized a nationwide hour of prayer for the cause of justice for blacks.
    While criticizing itself for focusing too much on individual civil rights issues and neglecting the central issue of racial segregation, the Communist Party has pledged to fully support the struggles ahead.
    Opposing the black people and their allies are not only the masked terrorists of the Ku Klux Klan, but also a large group of plainclothes racists who have joined the "White Citizens' Councils." These people specialize in imposing economic sanctions on blacks who participate in the struggle for freedom, depriving them of jobs and credit. Significantly, these "White Citizens' Councils" are led and funded by so-called "reputable" people in the southern states – bankers, industrialists, and big businessmen.
    These gentlemen fully understand that if blacks win full freedom, it will undermine the lucrative racial wage differentials, which have led to even more profitable regional wage differentials, which in turn help to drive down wage levels across the country.
    In the current situation, southern bosses can say to their workers: "If you don't like the low pay, leave, and I'll hire blacks for even less." And bosses in the northern states can say to their workers: "If you don't like the low pay, leave, and I'll bring cheap labor from the South, or move the factory south!"
    The American labor movement, which has gradually come to understand these realities of life, has now united and is planning to organize white and black workers in the South to launch a concerted offensive.
    The final emancipation of blacks will have far-reaching political and economic consequences. American reactionaries understand that blacks with the right to vote, cooperating with their white colleagues, will drive the anti-labor warmongers out of Congress, warmongers who have relied on the southern oligarchy to remain in Congress for decades. Thus, the emancipation of blacks offers the hope of a rapid shift in American foreign policy towards rationality. It is therefore not surprising that reactionaries are placing as many obstacles as possible in the way of black people voting. For example, in North Carolina, blacks who register to vote are often asked such absurd questions as: "How many windows are there in the courthouse?"
    Advancing Along the Path of Freedom
    Of course, struggle is nothing new to American blacks, who have constantly fought for their rights. After the Civil War of 1861-1865 freed blacks from slavery, blacks and poor whites in the southern states jointly established a democratic system during the ensuing ten-year Reconstruction period. But later, the foundation they built was destroyed by Ku Klux Klan terrorism and the American government's failure to carry out the work of liberation.
    It is not an exaggeration to say that Uncle Sam liberated the blacks like a dog, and then left it in the middle of a pack of wolves and turned a blind eye. The recent court rulings that support black rights but lack vigorous enforcement illustrate this point.
    During the Reconstruction period in the southern states, blacks waged a determined struggle for life and freedom, and have continued this struggle to this day. If the bodies of those who have fallen in the struggle against racism were linked together, their length would be enough to cross the American continent. If the hours spent in solitary confinement and prison cells for the same reason were added up, that time would be endless.
    Now American blacks have re-adopted mass-scale actions in strengthening the struggle. The fact is that in recent years, the democratic wave of colored people in Asia and Africa overthrowing imperialism has given new hope and encouragement to American blacks. And the aroused moral condemnation has brought pressure to bear on American racists through the United Nations and the Asian-African Conference.
    An equally important factor in creating more democracy within the United States is the news of the efforts of the Soviet Union, New China, and other socialist countries to eliminate racial discrimination, which has passed through the smokescreen of rumors spread by the American press.
    The American Supreme Court's rulings unfavorable to racism were in fact won by American blacks themselves, with the support of billions of people in the United States and other countries of the world. No one should be under the illusion that the American Supreme Court will suddenly become a champion of black rights. Just months after ruling against segregation in schools, the Supreme Court made another ruling that reeked of racial discrimination. Twenty-nine of the forty-eight states in the United States have laws prohibiting marriage between blacks, Asians, and other people of color and American whites. The Supreme Court refused to review the imprisonment of an Alabama woman who violated this law, saying: "We cannot see in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution or in other provisions of this great document a requirement that a state cannot enact laws to prevent the extinction of racial pride, but rather must allow corrupt bloodlines that can degrade or destroy the character of its citizens."
       Enemies and Friends
    American blacks have learned through bitter experience that even if court rulings are in their favor, judgments alone cannot change their lives. Although the Supreme Court ruled against racial residential segregation in 1917, against racial segregation in state universities in 1935, against white monopoly of election nominations in 1944, against racial segregation in interstate travel in 1946, and against racial segregation in public primary and secondary schools in 1954, blacks are still forced to live in filthy ghettos, are stoned when trying to attend "white" universities, risk their lives to vote, and are thrown into prison en masse for refusing to sit in the back of buses.
    The FBI never hesitates to use all its power to fabricate and buy "evidence" that progressive people are engaged in so-called sabotage activities. But when lynch mobs violate the constitutional rights of blacks, this agency turns a blind eye.
    In the southern states, where ten million blacks live, there is not a single local, state, or federal police agency from which blacks can hope to obtain protection. The militia in this region is entirely white and has been specially trained to "deal with" riots. As shown in Columbia, Tennessee, and elsewhere, these militias have used tear gas and machine guns to clear the way for white mobs to attack blacks.
    However, blacks are not without friends. Many progressive, unbiased, and religious people stand by their side. Over the years, blacks have learned to see communists as their staunchest supporters. As for the Christian Church, many are gradually fulfilling their obvious responsibilities. Last year, seven white leaders of Southern churches lost their jobs for advocating the abolition of racial segregation.
    An urgent question that needs to be answered at present is what role the newly united labor organizations will play in the struggle for black rights. The various trade unions with more than sixteen million people include two million black members. If blacks can get the organized support of their white trade union brothers, the ice of racism can be broken relatively quickly.
    In terms of strength, the current strength of blacks is far greater than at any time in the past. In stubbornly eliminating the obstacles imposed on them, they have greatly overcome the cultural backwardness that seriously disadvantaged them in the past.
    By paying attention to defending themselves, seeking the support of organized labor, and avoiding being provoked into useless actions, American blacks are advancing courageously and winning a series of victories. When their final victory arrives, this will not only make the democratic forces in the United States rejoice, but also the people of the world who love peace and democracy.

    美国黑人在争取自由
    美国作家　肯尼迪
    美国黑人争取自由的斗争，已进行了几百年。他们现在再次以群众斗争的方式来反对他们的压迫者。
    同时，压迫者为了竭力使那自称为“白人至上”的经济、政治和社会制度万世长存，也采取了越来越恶毒和残暴的恐怖方式。
    为数达一千六百万人以上的美国黑人，已决定不再容许别人用“不”字来回答他们争取平等权利的正当要求。由资产阶级领导的全国有色人种协进会曾提出“到1963年取得自由”的口号，但是大多数黑人并不期望在未来七年中，充分的自由会像奇迹一般地来到他们面前。现在他们正催促全国有色人种协进会采取战斗行动，并在每一条战线上展开坚决的群众斗争。
    亚拉巴马州的蒙哥马利市从前曾是美国奴隶所有者的南部同盟的首都。这个城市的黑种人所表现的战斗的团结，激发了每一个美国黑人的理想。这种斗争方式正在很快地传播开来。蒙哥马利市抵制公共汽车的运动赢得了法院的有利判决，其重要性不亚于1954年最高法院的反对在教育制度中实行种族隔离的判决。最近，这类抵制武器已用来对付“可口可乐”的制造商们，他们曾一直资助种族主义者的匪党。
    在反对奴隶身份的斗争火焰中诞生的黑人教堂已摆脱了它的昏睡状态，并积极投入了斗争。黑人领袖们为黑人孩子爱米特·蒂尔所受的残酷的杀害所震动，并为蒙哥马利市的抵制运动所鼓舞，曾组织了一次在全国范围内为黑种人的正义事业作一小时祈祷的运动。
    共产党在批评了自己过于着重公民个人权利事件而忽略种族隔离的中心问题的同时，已经保证要全力支持面临的斗争。
    同黑种人以及他们的同盟者作对的不仅有三K党的蒙面的恐怖主义者，还有一大群参加了“白人公民委员会”的着普通衣服的种族主义者。这些人专门从事对参加争取自由的斗争的黑人施行经济处罚，剥夺他们的工作和信贷。而具有重要意义的是，这些“白人公民委员会”正是由南部各州所谓“有声望”的人士——银行家、实业家和大商人——所领导并供给资金。
    这些先生们完全懂得，如果让黑人赢得充分自由，那就会破坏获利优厚的种族工资差别，这种差别曾引出了更为有利可图的地区工资差别，而地区工资差别又有助于拉低整个国家的工资水平。
    在现时情况下，南部的老板们可以向他们的工人说：“如果你嫌钱少，就请走吧，我要用更少的钱来雇黑人。”而北部各州的老板们也可以向他们的工人说：“如果你嫌钱少，就请走吧，我将把南部廉价的劳动力运来，或者把工厂移到南方去！”
    逐渐地懂得了这些生活现实的美国劳工运动现在已联合起来，并正在计划组织南方的白种和黑种工人来发动一次同心协力的攻势。
    黑人的最后解放，将产生有深远影响的政治和经济后果。美国的反动派懂得，有选票在手的黑种人同他们的白种同事合作，就会把反对劳工的战争贩子逐出国会，几十年来这些战争贩子就是依仗南部的寡头统治而一直留在国会中。这样，黑人的解放就有使美国外交政策迅速走向合理的希望。因此，反动派在黑人投票的道路上设置尽可能多的障碍也就不足为奇了。例如在北卡罗来纳州，进行投票登记的黑人常遇到这样一些无聊问题：“法院里有几个窗户？”
    沿着自由的道路前进
    当然，对于曾为自己的权利而不断斗争的美国黑人说来，奋斗并不是新奇的事。1861—1865年的南北战争使黑人摆脱奴隶地位之后，在接踵而来的为期十年的南部各州改造时期中，黑人同南部各州贫穷的白种人曾共同建立了一个民主的制度。但是后来，他们建立的这个基础终于因三K党的恐怖主义和美国政府没有进行解放工作而遭到破坏。
    如果有人说山姆大叔是像对待一只狗那样把黑人解放出来，然后将它留在一群狼中间掉头不顾，那么这种比喻并不算过火。最近法院所作的那些支持黑人权利而缺乏强力执行的判决，正是说明了这一点。
    在南部各州改造时期中，黑人为了争取生活和自由曾进行了坚决的斗争，并把这一斗争一直继续到今天。如果把在反对种族主义斗争中倒下来的人的身体连起来，他们的长度就足以穿越美洲大陆。如果把为了同一理由而在监狱的单人房间和牢窟中消磨的小时加起来，那么这一时间就会是无穷无尽的。
    现在美国黑人在加强战斗中已重新采用了群众规模的行动。事实是，近年来亚非两洲有色人种推翻帝国主义的民主浪潮已经给了美国黑人以新的希望和鼓舞。而被激发起来的人类道义上的谴责已经通过联合国和亚非会议向美国种族主义者施加压力。
    使美国内部产生更多民主的一个同等重要因素，是穿过美国报刊所散布的谣言烟幕而传来的关于苏联、新中国和其他社会主义国家努力消除种族歧视的消息。
    美国最高法院不利于种族主义的那些判决，实际上是获得了美国和世界其他国家亿万人民支持的美国黑人自己争取到的。没有人会抱有这种幻想，认为美国最高法院会突然变成争取黑人权利的战士。就在判决禁止学校实行种族隔离之后的几个月，最高法院便作了另一个散布着十足的种族歧视臭味的判决。美国的四十八州就有二十九个州订有禁止黑人、亚洲人和其他有色人种同美国白种人通婚的立法。最高法院曾拒绝重新审查对触犯这条法律的一个亚拉巴马州女人所作的监禁判决，而竟然说：“我们在宪法第十四条修正条款中或这个伟大文件的其他条文中没有能看出这样的要求：一个州不能制定法律来防止种族自豪的消灭，反而倒必须允许那种能降低或毁掉它的公民品德的败坏血统行为。”
       敌和友
    美国黑人通过痛苦的经验懂得，即令法院的判决有利于他们，但仅是判决还不能改变他们的生活。虽然最高法院1917年规定了反对划分种族居住区，1935年规定了反对州立大学的种族隔离，1944年规定了反对白种人垄断选举提名，1946年规定了反对各州间旅行的种族隔离，1954年规定了反对在公立中、小学实行种族隔离，但是直到今天黑人仍然被迫住在污秽的犹太街上，在考取“白人”大学时受到石子的袭击，为了投票要冒生命的危险，为了拒绝坐在公共汽车的后坐上而被大批投进监狱。
    联邦调查局从来不惜用一切力量来捏造并收买关于进步人士在从事所谓破坏活动的“证据”。但是当私设刑庭的暴徒们破坏黑人的宪法权利时，这个机关却掉头不顾。
    在住有一千万黑人的南部各州，竟没有一个地方的、州或联邦的警察机关，黑人能够希望取得它们的保护。这个地区的民兵本身就全是白种人，并受过“应付”骚乱的特别训练。正像在哥伦比亚、田纳西以及其他地方所显示的，这些民兵应付白种暴徒侵犯黑人的行动时，竟用催泪瓦斯和机关枪为这些暴徒开路。
    不过黑人也不是没有朋友。很多进步的、没有偏见的和教会的人士都站在他们一边。经过了这些年月，黑人已学会把共产党人看作是他们最坚决的支持者。至于基督教教会，许多人也在逐渐尽自己的明显的职责。去年便有南方教会的七个白种领袖因为主张取消种族隔离而失掉工作。
    目前需要回答的一个迫切问题就是，新近联合起来的劳工组织将在争取黑人权利的斗争中起什么作用。拥有一千六百多万人的各业工会共包括有两百万黑人会员，如果黑人能够得到他们的白种工会兄弟有组织的支持，那么种族主义的坚冰就可以比较快地被击破。
    以力量来说，现时黑人的力量已比过去任何时期都远为强大。他们在顽强地消除强加给他们的障碍中，已经大大克服了过去严重地不利于他们的文化落后状态。
    美国的黑人由于注意保卫自己，争取有组织的劳工的支持，并避免受挑衅而卷入无益的行动，正在勇猛前进，赢得了一连串的胜利。当他们的最后胜利到来的时候，这就不仅会使美国国内的民主力量，而且也会使世界爱好和平和民主的人士感到欢欣鼓舞。
