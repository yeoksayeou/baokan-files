    Instructions from the CCP Central Committee and the State Council on the Current Grain Sales and Autumn Grain Unified Purchase and Sales Work

    Since wheat and early rice entered the market this year, the national grain sales volume has been very abnormal. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Grain, the sales volume in July this year was 1.07 billion jin more than the same period last year, the sales volume in August was 1.48 billion jin more than the same period last year, and the sales volume in September was 1.7 billion jin more than the same period last year. The total sales volume in July, August, and September was 4.3 billion jin more than the same period last year (about 1.6 billion jin more in disaster areas and about 2.7 billion jin more in general areas). Even compared with the same period in 1954, when there were particularly severe disasters, the sales volume was 1.6 billion jin more, and this trend of increasing sales is still developing. In addition, in terms of grain requisition and unified purchase, the result of the summer requisition this year was 3 billion jin less grain than the same period last year. Now the autumn grain requisition and unified purchase are about to begin, and in many places there is an attitude that they want to reduce requisition and purchase regardless of whether the harvest is good or bad. In short, blindly expanding sales and demanding a reduction in requisition and purchase are problems that need serious attention in the current grain work. The early rice harvest this summer was a bumper one, and wheat production still increased compared with last year. Since the beginning of autumn, although some areas have suffered from serious floods, droughts, and wind disasters, the harvests in many areas have been good, and the total output nationwide still exceeds last year. Grain supplies in disaster areas need to be increased, but grain supplies in general areas should not be increased; the development of pig raising and sideline production requires some increase in supply, but it should not be increased so much. Grain requisition in disaster areas needs to be reduced, and in general areas, there is no reason to demand a reduction in grain requisition when grain production has increased and other areas have suffered disasters and need support.

    Since the second half of 1955, the grain shortage in our country has been significantly alleviated, and the situation of the state's unified purchase and sales of grain has been further stabilized. This alleviation and stabilization are due, on the one hand, to the development of agricultural cooperativization and the bumper harvest of agriculture; on the other hand, it is also due to the fact that our whole Party and governments at all levels have paid serious attention to the grain issue, concentrated their efforts, carried out meticulous and in-depth work, implemented the three-fix measure for grain, and rectified the unified urban and rural grain sales. It is wrong not to see the significant role of the above series of work in stabilizing the grain situation. Recently, some comrades have felt that the grain situation has improved, and therefore believe that the grain problem has been basically solved. Therefore, they believe that grain sales do not need to be as strictly controlled as in the past, and grain requisition and unified purchase can no longer be grasped so tightly. This idea is wrong. It must be pointed out that although agricultural cooperativization has been carried out and agricultural production has developed to some extent, the growth of grain demand in our country still far exceeds the growth of grain production. This situation of production and sales contradiction will still exist for a relatively long period of time, and still requires us to do a good job in grain requisition and sales with great efforts. Any complacency or negligence in this regard is wrong.

    Therefore, the CCP Central Committee and the State Council believe that the following points must be implemented in all localities for the grain supply work and the upcoming autumn grain requisition and unified purchase work:

    1.  It is necessary to continue to implement the principle of supplying grain whenever there is a shortage. From now until February next year is the season when farmers have more grain, and the state's grain sales volume must be effectively controlled. Reasonable needs must be guaranteed; the necessary grain for disaster areas must be met (the grain supply standard for disaster areas should be lower than that of general areas); however, unreasonable and unnecessary supplies should be resolutely corrected. The state needs to appropriately supply a portion of grain for pig raising and the development of sideline production, but it should mainly rely on the grain increased by agricultural cooperatives and farmers themselves or find substitute feed; urban grain unified sales have also been too broad recently, the system has been loosely controlled, and waste has grown. This should also be appropriately controlled. The purpose of doing this is to sell as little grain as possible during the season when farmers have grain, so that the state has the strength to fully guarantee the supply during the season when rural areas lack grain from March to June next year. This is an extremely important experience. Some people believe that the state only needs to control the difference between grain requisition and sales and be able to dispatch it, and does not need to excessively control sales volume. This idea is harmful. Its danger lies in the fact that if it is not controlled now, more grain will be sold when it should not be sold more, and then it will not be possible to sell less during the grain shortage season in the future, and in the end, the difference between purchase and sales cannot be guaranteed. The lesson of the grain shortage from July 1954 to June 1955 should not be repeated.

    2.  The state's grain requisition should be combined with the internal distribution of agricultural cooperatives, so that agricultural cooperatives first complete the state-approved grain requisition tasks, and then carry out internal distribution. This summer, some areas adopted the method of distributing grain to members first, and then the state requisitioning from members, which not only increased unnecessary trouble, but also affected the smooth completion of the state's requisition tasks. When some agricultural cooperatives carried out distribution, they did not first take care of the needs, and mechanically allocated grain to members according to labor work points, which made the disparity between surplus and shortage of grain among members too large, which resulted in increasing the difficulty of internal adjustment and expanding the amount of state supply. These practices should be avoided in the future.

    3.  It is necessary to continue to adhere to the principle of combining purchase and sales, so that rural grain unified purchase and sales can be arranged at the same time. After agricultural cooperativization, the distribution of agricultural income has changed, and the surplus and shortage of grain among members has also changed after internal adjustment. The original purchase and sales figures determined by household and small cooperatives have often needed to be re-adjusted and verified. What the state requires is: According to the recently released regulations on grain unified purchase and sales of agricultural production cooperatives, unified calculations should be made on the basis of the original three-fix figures, with the cooperative as the unit. If the fixed sales figure can be reduced with certainty, the unified purchase figure can be appropriately reduced; however, the reduction in the unified purchase figure should be less than the reduction in the fixed sales figure, so as to ensure that the purchase and sales difference stipulated by the state can be effectively guaranteed. All localities can independently control the adjustment based on specific conditions, under this premise. It must be noted that the sales and requisition must be arranged in a unified manner, and the mistake of only caring about requisition during requisition and not being able to control sales in the future must not be repeated.

    4.  In grain-producing areas, it is necessary to appropriately increase the amount of unified purchase to support disaster areas, but the principle is that the increased purchase figure should not exceed 40% of the increased production. The degree of disaster suffered by some areas this year is no less than that of 1954. Grain requisition in these areas must be reduced, and grain supply must be increased. Only the support of grain-producing areas can guarantee the increased supply in disaster areas and help farmers in disaster areas to overcome the famine through production. As long as the increased purchase figure from grain-producing areas does not exceed 40% of the increased grain production, according to the regulations of the Interim Measures for Grain Unified Purchase and Sales in Rural Areas, more than 60% of the increased production will still be left to farmers, and the state will not requisition it; as long as farmers are informed that abundant areas have the responsibility to actively support disaster areas, the farmer masses will be happy to support them.

    All localities must conduct an inspection of the current grain sales situation, and make appropriate arrangements for the supply quantity from now to February next year; and according to the above principles and the provisions of relevant measures, combine with the local specific situation to deploy the unified purchase and sales after the autumn harvest. The targets for grain requisition and sales in various localities will be issued separately by the State Council. October 12, 1956

    中共中央国务院关于目前粮食销售和秋后粮食统购统销工作的指示
    今年小麦、早稻登场以来，全国粮食销量很不正常。根据粮食部的统计，今年7月份销量比去年同期多十亿七千万斤，8月份销量比去年同期多十四亿八千万斤，9月份销量比去年同期多十七亿斤，七、八、九三个月合计共比去年同期多销四十三亿斤（灾区多销的约有十六亿斤，一般地区多销的约有二十七亿斤），即使同遭受特大灾荒的1954年同期比较还多销十六亿斤，而且这种销量上涨的趋势还在继续发展。另外在粮食征收和统购方面，今年夏季征收的结果，比去年同期少收粮食三十亿斤。现在秋季粮食征收和统购即将开始，许多地方有着这样一种情绪，即是不管收成好坏，都要求减少征购。总之，销量盲目扩大，征购要求减少，这是目前粮食工作上需要严重注意的问题。今年夏季早稻是丰收的，小麦产量比去年仍有增加。入秋以来，虽然若干地区遭受了严重的水灾、旱灾和风灾，但是许多地区的年景是好的，从全国来说总的产量仍超过去年。受灾地区的粮食供应须要增加，一般地区的粮食供应不应当增加；发展养猪和发展副业需要增加一些供应，但不应当增加这样多。受灾地区的粮食征购须要减少，一般地区的粮食征购，在粮食产量增加和其他地区发生灾荒须要支援的情况下，没有理由也要求减少。
    1955年下半年以来，我国的粮食紧张情况有了显著的缓和，国家粮食统购统销的局势进一步稳定了。这种缓和和稳定，一方面是由于农业合作化发展了，农业丰收了；另一方面，还由于我们全党和各级政府认真重视粮食问题，集中力量，进行了细致深入的工作，实行了粮食三定的措施，整顿了城乡粮食统销。看不到上述一系列工作对于稳定粮食局势的重大作用是不对的。近来有些同志觉得粮食局势有了好转，就认为粮食问题已经基本解决了，因此认为粮食销量可以不必像以往那样严格地控制，粮食的征收和统购也可以不再那样抓紧了，这种想法是错误的。必须指出，尽管农业合作化了，农业生产有了若干发展，但是我国粮食需要的增长仍远远走在粮食生产增长的前面，这种产销矛盾的情况，在一个较长时期以内将仍然存在，仍然要求我们用极大的力量把粮食征购和销售工作做好，对于这方面的任何麻痹疏忽都是错误的。
    为此，中共中央和国务院认为，对于粮食供应工作和即将到来的秋粮征收统购工作，各地必须执行下列各点：
    一、必须继续贯彻执行什么时候缺粮、什么时候供应的原则。现在到明年2月是农民粮食较多的季节，应当切实控制国家的粮食销量。合理的需要必须保证；灾区必不可少的粮食必须满足（灾区的粮食供应标准应当低于一般地区）；但是不合理和不必要的供应，应当坚决纠正。养猪和发展副业，国家须要适当地供应一部分粮食，但主要还是要依靠农业社和农民自己增产的粮食或者寻找代用饲料；城市粮食统销近来也有偏宽的情况，制度掌握得松了，浪费滋长了，也应当适当控制。这样作，目的是在农民有粮季节尽量少销一些，以便到明年三至六月农村缺粮季节，国家有力量充分保证供应。这是一条极为重要的经验。有人认为，国家只要掌握粮食征购和销售之间的差额，能够调度就行了，不必过多地控制销量。这种想法是有害的。它的危险性就在于现在不加控制，在不应当多销的时候把粮食多销了，将来缺粮季节又不能少销，到最后购销差额就不能保证。1954年7月至1955年6月粮食紧张的教训是不应当重复的。
    二、国家粮食征购应当同农业合作社社内分配结合进行，使农业合作社首先完成国家核定的粮食征购任务，然后进行社内分配。今年夏季有些地区采取了先把粮食分给社员，然后国家又向社员征购的办法，既增加了不必要的麻烦，又影响了国家征购任务的顺利完成。有些地区农业合作社进行分配的时候，没有首先照顾需要情况，机械地将粮食按劳动工分搭配给社员，使社员之间粮食余缺悬殊过大，结果增加了社内调剂的困难，扩大了国家供应的数量。这些作法今后应当避免。
    三、必须继续坚持购销结合的原则，使农村粮食统购和统销同时得到安排。农业合作化以后，农业收入分配的情况起了变化，经过社内调剂，社员粮食余缺的情况也有了变化，原来分户和分小社确定的购销数字，许多已经有必要重新调整核定。国家要求的是：根据最近发布的关于农业生产合作社粮食统购统销的规定，在原来三定数字的基础上，以社为单位统一计算。定销数字确有把握减少的，可以适当减少一部分统购数字；但统购数字的减少，应当小于定销数字的减少，以便使国家规定的购销差额能够切实得到保证。各地可以根据具体情况，在这个前提下，自行掌握调整。必须注意的是：一定要将销售和征购统一安排，不要重复过去征购时只管征购、将来销售无法控制的错误。
    四、在粮食增产地区，须要适当增加一点统购数量以支援灾区，但增购的数字仍以不超过增产部分的40％为原则。今年若干地区受灾的程度不下于1954年，这些地区粮食征购必须减少，粮食供应必须增加，只有增产地区的支援，才能保证灾区增加了的供应，帮助灾区农民生产渡荒。只要按照农村粮食统购统销暂行办法的规定，向增产地区增购的数字，不超过粮食增产部分的40％，增产部分的60％以上仍然留归农民，国家不予征购；只要向农民说明，丰产地区有积极支援灾区的责任，农民群众是会乐意支援的。
    各地对目前的粮食销售情况，必须进行一次检查，将现在到明年2月的供应数量重新作出适当的安排；并且按照上述原则和有关办法的规定，结合当地具体情况，布置秋后的统购统销。各地粮食征购和销售的指标，另由国务院分别下达。　1956年10月12日
