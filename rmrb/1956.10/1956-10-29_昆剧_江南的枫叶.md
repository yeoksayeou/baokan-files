Kunqu Opera – Maple Leaves of Jiangnan
Zhang Yunhe

Beijing is experiencing an autumn of “pale skies and idle clouds,” with chrysanthemums blooming everywhere. Suzhou, a typical Jiangnan city, is also at the time when “frosty leaves are redder than February flowers.” A program list for the Suzhou Kunqu Opera performances, enclosed in a letter from the south, made me not only miss my second hometown but also yearn for the gathering of Kunqu Opera talents. Kunqu Opera, a drama form that inherits excellent traditions, shines brightly like maple leaves after a severe frost.

The repertoire for the performances includes about thirty plays. This performance brings together actors and Kunqu enthusiasts from various fields. Veteran artists of the “Chuan” generation, the “Shi” generation, young students from the Kunqu Opera Training Class, as well as amateur Kunqu Opera enthusiasts, all participated in the performances.

The singing artistry of veteran artists such as Zhou Chuan’ying, Zhu Chuanming, Zhang Chuanfang, and Hua Chuanhao is well-known and cannot be fully discussed in a short time. I will now only talk about the situation of one or two Kunqu enthusiasts that I know. Kunqu enthusiasts once had a saying, "The Yu family sings, the Xu family acts." The Yu family refers to the late Mr. Yu Sulu and his son, Mr. Yu Zhenfei, who participated in this performance. The Xu family, Xu Lingyun and his son Xu Ziquan, also participated in this performance.

Mr. Yu Sulu emphasized intonation, phonology, pronunciation, and melodic flow. He had a son late in life. When Mr. Zhenfei was crying in his cradle, the old gentleman would pat the child while humming tunes, “Riding on the evening glow and solitary wild ducks in Jiangxiang,” which is the first line of the "Red Embroidered Shoes" aria from the third act of *Handan Dream* written by Tang Xianzu, often used as a lullaby. Mr. Zhenfei was not only nurtured by his father from an early age but also possessed a natural voice. Later, he put in a lot of hard work himself. Last year, when he performed in Shanghai twice, I saw him backstage, still diligently studying the script and researching the singing style. He was originally a Kunqu enthusiast and gradually became a professional actor around the age of thirty. An actor cannot rely solely on environment and talent; they must also add unremitting effort. His success today is not accidental.

Mr. Xu Lingyun, who is over seventy years old this year, is a person worth noting in this performance. He performed in a total of six plays, playing six different roles, covering almost all roles: *sheng* (male), *dan* (female), *jing* (painted face), and *chou* (clown). For example, in *The Linked Ring Scheme*, Wang Yun in “Small Banquet” is a *laosheng* (old male role); in *The Linked Ring Scheme*, Lu Bu in “Dressing and Throwing the Halberd” is a *zhiweisheng* (pheasant-feathered male role); Zheng Yuanhe in *The Embroidered Robe* “Selling Xingdang and Scarf” is a “shoepizhongsheng” – a *xiaosheng* (young male role) who wears shoes instead of boots, also called a poor *sheng*; the ugly young lady in *Mistaken Kite* “Shocking the Ugly” is a *chou* role, but is inherently a *dan* role; and Zhang Wenyuan in *Water Margin* “Borrowing Tea” is a *fujing* (secondary painted face). I still remember his seventh role! Twenty years ago, he played the book boy Laixing in *Selling Xingdang and Scarf*. Although he was already fifty years old at that time and had no teeth, when Zheng Yuanhe was so poor that he wanted to sell Laixing, Laixing was so anxious that he rolled around on the ground, refusing to leave. That childlike, innocent, and spoiled scene is still vivid in my mind today. Although I have not seen this performance, I think that Mr. Xu is getting stronger as he gets older, and art has no end. His acting skills may have improved further.

Mr. Xu said that he did not expect that he was already over seventy years old and was still wearing the boots he wore when he was seventeen to perform on stage. From this sentence, it can be seen that he is very happy to participate in this performance. He has preserved these boots for more than fifty years, which shows his love for Kunqu Opera and his loyalty to the art.

Kunqu Opera is about to hold a grander performance in Shanghai, with more artists and Kunqu enthusiasts from various fields participating. It is said that there are more than eighty plays. I believe that in the near future, the colorful scenery of Jiangnan's maple leaves will be unfolded in front of more people in Beijing and other places.

    昆剧——江南的枫叶
    张允和
    北京是“天淡云闲”的秋天，到处开遍了菊花。典型的江南城市——苏州也正是“霜叶红于二月花”的时候了。从南方寄来的信里，附了一份苏州昆剧观摩的节目单，使我不只是怀念我的第二故乡，更怀念着昆剧的群英会。昆剧，这个承继着优良传统的剧种，它像是严霜后的枫叶一样灿烂夺目。
    观摩的剧目，大约有三十多出。这次演出集合了多方面的演员和曲友。传字辈的老艺人，世字辈和昆曲演员训练班年青学员们，以及一些业余爱好昆曲的曲友们都参加了演出。
    老艺人们，像周传瑛、朱传茗、张传芳、华传浩等人的演唱艺术是有口皆碑，人人都知道的，而且一时也谈不尽。我现在仅仅就我所知道的一二曲友的情况谈一谈。曲友们曾有一句话，叫做“俞家唱、徐家做”。俞家是已经去世的俞粟庐先生和这次参加演出的俞振飞先生父子，徐家的徐凌云、徐子权父子也参加了这次演出。
    俞粟庐先生讲究声调、音韵、吐字、行腔。他晚年得子，当振飞先生在摇篮中啼哭的时候，老先生一面手里拍着孩子，一面口里哼着曲子，
  “趁江乡落霞孤鹜”是经常作为催眠歌的，这是汤显祖写的邯郸梦三醉中“红绣鞋”曲牌的第一句。振飞先生从小既得到父亲的熏陶，又有一副得天独厚的噪子，后来自己又下了很大的苦功。去年上海两次演出时，我在后台见到他，他还是手不释卷，时常在揣摩剧情和研究唱腔。他原来是曲友，到三十岁左右才渐渐成为正式演员。一位演员单靠环境和天才还是不够的，必须加上不懈的努力，他有今天的成功不是偶然的。
    徐凌云老先生今年已经七十多了，是这次观摩演出中值得注意的人。他一共演了六出戏，扮了六个不同的角色，几乎把生、旦、净、丑都演到了。如连环记“小宴”里的王允是老生，同样连环记“梳妆掷戟”里的吕布是雉尾生；绣襦记“卖兴当巾”的郑元和是“鞋皮生”——不穿靴子而穿鞋子的小生，又叫穷生；风筝误“惊丑”的丑小姐，这角色是丑，可是本身又是旦角；而水浒记“借茶”的张文远又是副净了。我还记得他的第七种角色呢！二十年前他在“卖兴当巾”演的是书僮来兴。虽然那时他已是五十岁的人，而且没有了牙齿，演到郑元和穷得无法要卖出来兴的时候，来兴急得就地打滚放赖不肯走，那种小孩子天真撒泼的情景，到今天还在我的眼前。这次的戏我虽然没有见到，可是想来徐老先生老当益壮，艺术无止境，他的演技可能更进了一步。
    徐老先生说，想不到他已经七十多了，居然还穿着十七岁时的靴子上台演戏，从这句话里可以看出他能参加这次演出是十分高兴的。他把这双靴子保存了五十多年，足见他对于昆曲的爱好和忠于艺术的精神。
    昆剧又要在上海举行更盛大的会演了，有各方面更多的艺人和曲友们参加，听说有八十多个剧目。我相信，不久的将来，江南的枫叶绚丽多采的景色，一定会展开在北京和其他各地更多人的面前。
