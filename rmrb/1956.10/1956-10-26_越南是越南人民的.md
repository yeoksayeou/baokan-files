    Vietnam Belongs to the Vietnamese People
    By Zhan Chao, Our Correspondent in Vietnam
    Vietnam belongs to the Vietnamese people, just as the United States belongs to the American people, England belongs to the English people, and France belongs to the French people. This is self-evident.
    Yet in this world, there are actually people who regard the sacred territory of the Vietnamese people as part of their own territory, and see Saigon as New York or some other port. Without the permission of the Vietnamese people, they continuously transport large quantities of military materials and military personnel into South Vietnam. Now, they even openly send their warships, airplanes, and armed forces to Saigon to show off their strength.
    News from South Vietnam says that since October 24th, the navies and air forces of the United States, Britain, France, Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand have been gathering in Saigon from various locations to participate in the "exercise" on October 26th. In this military exercise, the United States is again playing the main role, sending the heavy cruiser "Los Angeles," the aircraft carrier "Essex," seventy-five destroyers and helicopters, and more than two thousand naval personnel from the First Fleet of the Pacific to this small port of Saigon. At the same time, Britain and France are also working hard for this exercise. In addition to Deputy Foreign Minister Reading, who arrived in Saigon in advance on October 24th, Britain also specially sent four jet planes from Singapore to Saigon.
    The purpose of this military action by the United States and other countries is very obvious. They are trying to flaunt the "policy of strength" that has been universally condemned by the people of all countries, to intimidate the people of Vietnam and Asian countries, and to cheer up the increasingly unpopular Ngo Dinh Diem clique, in order to further control South Vietnam and suppress the increasingly vigorous national independence and peaceful neutrality movements of the anti-colonial rule of the people of Asia and Africa.
    But the U.S. imperialists' wishful thinking is wrong. This action by him and his accomplices not only did not scare the Vietnamese people, but aroused the universal anger of the people of this country. Now, the Vietnamese people, from the North to the South, are launching a movement against the encroachment of U.S. imperialism and others on territorial sovereignty and the implementation of armed blackmail. The sentence "Vietnam belongs to the Vietnamese people" has become a common language for everyone. Wu Jiafu, a national model worker in Vietnam's industry, said: "We Vietnamese people are the masters of our country. Anything related to our country that does not go through our people is impossible. The common desire of the Vietnamese people today is peace and unity. Whoever dares to violate our wishes, no matter how fierce and vicious he is, he will eventually fail." Nguyen Quoc Tri, a combat hero of the Vietnamese People's Army, said: "We Vietnamese people are peace-loving people, and also heroic people. We do not want to invade Missouri in the United States, and we do not want others to turn our South into their colony and military base. Have those madmen who are dreaming of aggression forgotten the lessons of history? When our Vietnamese people's armed forces were still very young, we defeated the invaders and won the victory of the 'August Revolution.' When our people's armed forces were not very strong, we persisted in the war of resistance for eight or nine years, defeated the French colonialists and the American interventionists, and won the historic victory of Dien Bien Phu. These things should evoke deep memories in the minds of the invaders. Hurry up and put away your armed blackmail. Vietnam will always belong to the Vietnamese people."

    越南是越南人民的
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    越南是越南人民的，正如美国是美国人民的、英国是英国人民的、法国是法国人民的一样。这是天经地义的事情。
    可是在这个世界里，居然有人把越南人民神圣的国土看成是自己领地的一部分，把西贡看成是纽约或者别的什么港口，不经过越南人民的许可，就陆续不断地把大量的军事物资和军事人员运进越南南方。现在，甚至公然地把他们的军舰、飞机和武装部队派到西贡来耀武扬威了。
    从越南南方传来的消息说：自10月24日起，美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚、菲律宾和泰国的海军、空军等，分别从各处向西贡集结，以便参加10月26日的“演习”。在这次军事演习中，美国又扮演主要的角色，它把太平洋第一舰队中的“洛山矶号”重型巡洋舰、“埃色尔号”航空母舰、七十五架驱逐机和直升飞机以及两千多名海军人员，派到这个不大的西贡港口来了。同时，英法两国对于这一次演习也很卖力气，除了外交副大臣里丁先期在10月24日赶到西贡外，英国还专程自新加坡派出四架喷气式飞机到西贡来。
    美国等国家的这次军事行动的目的是很显然的，他们企图借此眩耀已经遭到各国人民普遍唾弃的“实力政策”，恫吓越南和亚洲国家人民，并替日益不得人心的吴庭艳集团打气，以便进一步控制越南南方和镇压亚非各国人民的正在日益蓬勃发展着的反殖民统治的民族独立和和平中立运动。
    可是美帝国主义的如意算盘打错了，他和他的同伙的这次行动，不仅没有吓倒越南人民，反而激起了这个国家的人民的普遍愤怒。现在越南人民从北方到南方，正在掀起一个反对美帝国主义等侵犯领土主权施行武装讹诈的运动。“越南是越南人民的”这句话，已经成为大家共同的语言。越南全国工业劳动模范吴家?说：“我们越南人民是我们国家的主人，任何有关我们国家的事情，如果不经过我们人民，都是行不通的。越南人民当前普遍的愿望就是和平和统一。谁要敢违犯我们这种愿望，不管他多么凶狠毒辣，他终归是要失败的。”越南人民军战斗英雄阮国治说：“我们越南人民是渴爱和平的人民，同时又是英雄的人民。我们并不想去侵犯美国的密苏里州，同时也不愿意旁人来把我们的南方变成他的殖民地和军事基地。难道那些做着侵略梦想的狂人忘掉了历史的教训吗？当我们越南人民的武装还很幼小的时候，我们就战胜了侵略者，取得了“八月革命的胜利”。当我们人民的武装并不很强大的时候，我们整整坚持了八九年的抗战，击败了法国殖民主义者和美国干涉者，取得了奠边府历史性的胜利。这些事情应该引起侵略者的深刻回忆，赶快把你们的武装讹诈行为收拾起来吧。越南永远是越南人民的。”
