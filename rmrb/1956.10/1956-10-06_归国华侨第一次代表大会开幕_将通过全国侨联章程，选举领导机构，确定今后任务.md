Xinhua News Agency, 5th - The First National Congress of Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China opened today at the Huairentang Hall in Zhongnanhai, the capital.

This congress is convened to establish the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. The congress will adopt the Constitution of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, elect the leading bodies of the National Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and discuss the tasks of the National Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese during the national transition period.

The congress was presided over by Chen Jiageng. In his opening address to the congress, Chen Jiageng said that overseas Chinese have always loved their country and their hometowns and are very willing to make contributions to their motherland and their hometowns. In recent years, many overseas Chinese have returned to the motherland to participate in production and construction, and have received various forms of care from the motherland. At present, the Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese should more broadly unite and organize returned overseas Chinese, their relatives, and overseas Chinese to strengthen socialist education; at the same time, it should further encourage and assist them to participate in the construction of the motherland. In addition, it should, where possible, organize or assist in organizing public welfare undertakings related to returned overseas Chinese and their relatives, in order to better serve returned overseas Chinese, their relatives, and overseas Chinese.

Chen Jiageng then pointed out: While we are proud of the growing strength of our motherland, we must not forget that Taiwan is still under the control of foreign forces. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. He said that patriotic overseas Chinese, together with all the people of the motherland, should assume the responsibilities they should bear in promoting the cause of the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

Chen Jiageng said that while the government of the motherland attaches great importance to overseas Chinese, in some areas, due to the fact that some cadres and relevant departments do not understand the situation of overseas Chinese and have not taken into account the characteristics of returned overseas Chinese, their relatives, and overseas Chinese, some shortcomings or deviations have occurred in their work. Some of these shortcomings or deviations have been corrected, and some are being corrected, but some shortcomings may still occur in the future progress of work. Therefore, the Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese should regularly report the situation of overseas Chinese to the relevant departments, convey the opinions of returned overseas Chinese, their relatives, and overseas Chinese, and actively make suggestions to make the future work better. This is also an important task of the Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese.

Chen Jiageng finally expressed his hope that after the establishment of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, local organizations of returned overseas Chinese will actively carry out their work, strive to expand the great patriotic unity of overseas Chinese, build a great motherland, and peacefully liberate Taiwan.

After Chen Jiageng's opening address, Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Xie Juezai, Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China, and He Xiangning, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, successively addressed the congress.

Li Jishen expressed his congratulations to the congress on behalf of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He said that this congress will play an active role in assisting the government to implement the policies on overseas Chinese affairs and in expanding and consolidating the great patriotic unity of overseas Chinese abroad. He said that the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is an organization of the people's democratic united front, and he hoped to maintain close contact with the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese in the future, and work together to unite and mobilize the vast number of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives to participate in socialist construction and to strengthen the great patriotic unity of overseas Chinese abroad.

In his speech, Li Weihan said that overseas Chinese in various parts of the world are an integral part of the people's democratic united front. The establishment of the National Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese shows the further expansion and consolidation of the patriotic united front of overseas Chinese. He said that we hope that through the efforts of the Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, overseas Chinese will, on the basis of loving the motherland, unite more widely, regardless of their origin, occupation, class, or belief; and that various overseas Chinese organizations, schools, newspapers, and overseas Chinese leaders in all fields will cooperate more closely. The National Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, domestically, should not only serve as a bridge for the Party and the government to contact returned overseas Chinese and their relatives; but also supervise the Party and the government.

In his speech, Xie Juezai expressed his hope that after the establishment of the National Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, it will regularly offer opinions and criticisms to the civil affairs departments in the implementation of the policies on overseas Chinese affairs, so as to improve their work.

He Xiangning said in her speech that the Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese is a mass organization formed by returned overseas Chinese and their relatives on a voluntary basis, and it plays an assisting and supervising role in the relevant government departments, especially the overseas Chinese affairs departments. She said that after the establishment of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, there will be a unified leading body for the work of the local federations of returned overseas Chinese, which will surely be able to more broadly unite and educate returned overseas Chinese and their relatives throughout the country, and connect with the vast number of overseas Chinese abroad, so as to fully exert a positive role in the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland; at the same time, it will certainly be able to make contributions to the cause of the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

A total of 345 delegates attended today's congress. They came from all over the country, and included not only the heads of local organizations of returned overseas Chinese, but also advanced workers, people from the cultural and educational circles, scientists, and industrialists and businessmen.

More than 800 people from overseas Chinese sightseeing groups and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao who came back to China from various places attended today's opening ceremony as observers. They were warmly welcomed by the congress.

Deng Zihui, Vice Premier of the State Council, Cai Tingkai and Chen Qiyou, Standing Committee members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and representatives of various democratic parties and people's organizations also attended the opening ceremony of the congress.

The congress will continue to be held.

    归国华侨第一次代表大会开幕
    将通过全国侨联章程，选举领导机构，确定今后任务
    新华社5日讯　中华全国归国华侨第一次代表大会，今天在首都中南海怀仁堂开幕。
    这次大会是为了成立中华全国归国华侨联合会召开的。大会将通过中华全国归国华侨联合会章程，选举全国侨联领导机构，并讨论全国侨联在国家过渡时期的任务。
    大会由陈嘉庚主持。陈嘉庚向大会致开幕词说，华侨一向爱国爱乡，很愿意对祖国和家乡有所贡献。几年来，已经有不少华侨回到祖国参加生产建设，得到祖国种种照顾。当前归国华侨联合会应该更广泛地团结和组织归侨、侨眷和华侨加强社会主义教育；同时要进一步鼓励并协助他们参加祖国建设事业。此外，要在可能的条件下，举办或者协助举办有关归侨和侨眷的公益事业，更好地为归侨、侨眷和华侨服务。
    陈嘉庚接着指出：当我们为祖国的日益强盛而感到自豪的时候，我们不能忘记台湾还在外国势力的控制之下。台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。他说，爱国的侨胞对于推动和平解放台湾的事业，应该和祖国全体人民一道，担当起应负的责任。
    陈嘉庚说，祖国政府很重视华侨，但是有一些地区，由于部分的干部和有关部门不了解侨情，没有照顾到归侨、侨眷和华侨的特点，所以工作上曾经发生一些缺点或偏差。这些缺点或偏差有的已经纠正，有的正在纠正，但是今后在工作的前进中还可能发生一些缺点，因此，归国华侨联合会应该经常向有关部门反映侨情，传达归侨、侨眷和华侨的意见，并积极提出建议，使今后的工作做得更好。这也是归国华侨联合会的一项重要任务。
    陈嘉庚最后表示希望中华全国归国华侨联合会成立以后，各地的归侨组织能够积极地展开工作，为扩大华侨爱国大团结，为建设伟大的祖国和和平解放台湾而奋斗。
    在陈嘉庚致开幕词以后，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席李济深，中共中央统一战线工作部部长李维汉，中华人民共和国内务部部长谢觉哉和华侨事务委员会主任何香凝先后向大会致词。
    李济深代表中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会向大会表示祝贺。他说，这次大会对于协助政府贯彻侨务政策以及扩大和巩固国外侨胞的爱国大团结，必将起积极的作用。他说，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会是人民民主统一战线的组织，希望今后同中华全国归国华侨联合会密切联系，为团结和动员广大归侨和侨眷参加社会主义建设，为加强国外侨胞的爱国大团结而共同努力。
    李维汉在致词中说，海外各地华侨是人民民主统一战线的组成部分。全国侨联的成立，表现了华侨爱国统一战线的进一步扩大和巩固。他说，我们希望经过侨联的努力，使海外华侨在爱护祖国的基础上，不分籍贯、职业、阶级和信仰，更加广泛地团结起来；使各种华侨团体、学校、报纸和各方面华侨领袖更加亲密合作。全国侨联在国内，不仅要帮助党和政府联系归侨、侨眷起着桥梁作用；而且要对党、政进行监督。
    谢觉哉在致词中表示希望全国侨联成立后，对民政部门在执行侨务政策方面经常提出意见和批评，以改进工作。
    何香凝致词说，侨联是归国华侨、侨眷自己在自觉自愿基础上组成的群众团体，对政府有关部门、尤其是侨务工作部门，起着协助和监督作用。她说，中华全国归国华侨联合会成立以后，对各地侨联工作，从此有了统一的领导机构，必定能够更广泛地团结和教育全国归侨、侨眷，并联系广大的国外侨胞，对祖国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，充分发挥积极作用；同时，对和平解放台湾事业，也一定能作出贡献。
    参加今天大会的代表共三百四十五人。他们来自全国各地，其中除了各地归国华侨组织的负责人外，还有先进工作者、文教界人士、科学家和工商业家。
    列席今天大会开幕式的，有各地华侨回国观光团的人士和港澳同胞八百多人。他们受到了大会的热烈欢迎。
    国务院副总理邓子恢，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员蔡廷锴、陈其尤等和各民主党派、各人民团体的代表也出席了大会的开幕式。
    大会将继续举行。
