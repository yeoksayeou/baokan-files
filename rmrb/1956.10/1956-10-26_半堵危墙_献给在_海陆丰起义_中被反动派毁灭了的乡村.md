    A Half-Standing Crumbling Wall
    —Dedicated to the Villages Destroyed by the Reactionaries in the "Hailufeng Uprising"
    Chen Shanwen

Like a hero's monument, high and silent, it rises from that green slope, a sea of green rice seedlings and trees.
Beneath the crumbling wall, a thin layer of rubble buries an ancient village—
    A fortified village where farmers held guns and clubs.
It buries its life of smoke and fire,
    Its long history of songs and legends,
It buries its men and women gritting their teeth,
    And the hatred splattered with fresh blood.
How many desperate battles!
How many mountains and seashores called out for the victorious people!
But, one dark night,
People! The "Purification Squad" and the "Black Dog Squad"
    Sneaked into the village.
Flames soared into the sky,
    Swirling with black smoke.
The ancient village turned to ashes.
Angry people rushed out from under their eaves.
People jumped into the trenches.
    Those who jumped into the trenches fell where they stood.
People ran towards the high mountains.
    Those who climbed the high mountains fought year after year
    In the deep valleys and hills of rocks and ferns.
Thirty years have passed,
Like a mighty river, the waves surging forward.
The people who ran away from here
    Never looked back.
The stream has silted up with deep mud,
Dense reeds obscure the road,
Creeping figs climb the high wall from the ground.
This high wall on the joyful plain
    Is an endless hymn to heroes.
A hundred bamboo flutes whisper and call slowly,
    Unable to exhaust its anger and remembrance.
A hundred plectrums tap lightly and quickly on the bronze strings of the dulcimer,
    Unable to express the glory and joy of those good people.
Spring dew turns the rich fields green.
The sun shines on this ruin and its high wall.
I salute you, my high, erect, half-standing crumbling wall,
My beloved village, my heroes, my dear brothers.
