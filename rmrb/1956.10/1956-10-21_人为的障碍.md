    Artificial Obstacles

    Recently, various regions in Guangdong Province have been vigorously developing sideline production, and there is an urgent need for various seedlings and raw materials. However, many rural markets have experienced abnormal phenomena of mutual blockades and embargoes. Yangjiang County is the main production area of ​​goose breeds in the province. Historically, neighboring areas have relied on this county for the supply of goose breeds. According to a survey, the county currently has more than 35,000 female geese, producing 400,000 goose breeds annually, and could potentially transfer 200,000 to support other regions. However, the relevant departments in the county are unwilling to let these goose breeds "export." Three agricultural cooperatives in Xinhui County sent purchasing personnel to Yangjiang County and bought a total of more than 70 female geese and more than 1,000 goslings, but they were intercepted and detained by the local authorities. The Xijiang area, which is rich in bamboo, and Shunde County, which is rich in fish fry, also prohibit the outward transfer of a single bamboo or a single fish fry. As a result, the bamboo weaving industry in the plains areas such as Nanhai and Dongguan, which have always relied on mountainous areas for raw materials, have had to stop production, and many areas with fish ponds have also been unable to raise fish.

    Why the blockade and embargo? Is it really because the local supply is insufficient? No. Lechang County has a lot of bamboo that cannot be sold. The Henan Agricultural Cooperative in Fucheng Township alone has more than 5,000 bitter bamboos that urgently need to be sold, but no one buys them. Lianshan County also has a large amount of thatch bamboo that cannot find a customer. However, some staff in these two counties insist that the local bamboo supply cannot meet the demand and restrict purchases from other places. Obviously, in order to further promote the development of certain agricultural and sideline production, it is necessary to ensure the smooth flow of goods, and it is necessary to eliminate such artificial obstacles.

    人为的障碍
    近来，广东省各地正在大力发展副业生产，迫切需要各种种苗、原料的时候，许多农村市场却出现了互相封锁禁运的不正常现象。阳江县是全省生产鹅种的主要产区，历年来邻近各地都要靠这个县供应鹅种。据调查，全县现有母鹅三万五千多只，年产鹅种四十万只，本来可以外调二十万只支援其他地区，可是这个县的有关部门却不愿让这些鹅种“出口”。新会县有三个农业社派采购人员到阳江县总共买了七十多只母鹅和一千多只小鹅，结果被当地拦路扣留。盛产竹子的西江地区和盛产鱼苗的顺德县，也都是不让一根竹子、一条小鱼外调，以致南海、东莞等平原地区向来靠山区供应原料的织竹业不能不停止生产，不少有鱼塘的地区也养不成鱼了。
    为什么要封锁禁运？真的是由于当地货源不足吗？不是。乐昌县有许多竹子销不出去，单是附城乡河南农业社就有五千多条苦竹急待出售，但却无人收购。连山县也有大量的茅竹找不到顾主。而这两个县有些工作人员却硬说本县竹子供不应求，限制外地采购。很显然，为了进一步促进某些农副业生产的发展，就必须使货畅其流，就必须消除这种人为的障碍。　　李少球
