Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th. A mass rally attended by over a thousand people was held yesterday afternoon in Sunagawa Town, a suburb of Tokyo, to oppose the Japanese government's attempt to use violence to survey land in Sunagawa Town in order to expand the US military base.

The rally was held with the participation of the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and twenty labor unions, student groups, cultural organizations, and others. The resolution passed at the rally stated that they would rather be crushed to death by bulldozers than allow the US military to expand its military base. The struggle of the people of Sunagawa Town is not only a struggle to defend their land and the lives of farmers, but has now developed into a new stage in the Japanese people's struggle for independence, peace, and opposition to nuclear war.

The resolution emphasized that we swear, with the will of all the Japanese people, to fight to the end to accomplish this sacred mission.

Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, Yoshio Shiga, a representative of the Communist Party, Yukitaka Haraguchi, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and Junji Kinoshita, a representative of the cultural community, successively addressed the rally, encouraging the struggle of the residents of Sunagawa Town and firmly expressing their willingness to fight together to the end. Asanuma Inejiro said that the US military base is the United States' foothold in Japan, and without completely removing this obstacle, Japan would not achieve true independence.

The Japanese government originally planned to begin surveying work on October 1st. Since that day, the residents of Sunagawa Town, with the support of a large number of workers and students, have been on alert, guarding against the government forcibly starting the survey. On October 1st, residents of Naha, the capital of Okinawa, used wireless telephones to encourage the struggle of the residents of Sunagawa Town. The residents of Sunagawa Town replied: "Let us join hands, because we share a common destiny."

Faced with strong opposition from the people, the Japanese government has postponed the date for starting the survey in Sunagawa Town to October 5th.

    誓死反对扩大美军基地  
    东京砂川町群众举行大会
    坚决不让日本政府强行测量土地
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：昨天下午在东京郊区砂川町举行了有一千多人参加的群众大会，反对日本政府为了扩大美军基地企图使用暴力测量砂川町的土地。
    这个大会是在日本共产党、社会党和二十个工会、学生团体、文化团体等参加下举行的。大会通过的决议说，宁愿给铲土机辗死，也不让美军扩大军事基地。砂川町人民的斗争不但是保卫土地和农民生活的斗争，而且现在已经发展到日本人民争取独立、和平和反对核子战争的新的阶段。
    决议强调说，我们以全体日本人民的意志宣誓，要为完成神圣任务而斗争到底。
    日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎、共产党代表志贺义雄、日本工会总评议会议长原口幸隆以及文化界代表木下顺二等相继在大会上致词，勉励砂川町居民的斗争，并且坚决表示他们愿意共同斗争到底。浅沼稻次郎说，美军基地是美国在日本的踏脚石，如果不彻底除去这个障碍，就没有日本的真正独立。
    日本政府原订10月1日开始进行测量工作。从那天以来，砂川町的居民就在大批工人和学生的支援下警戒着，防备政府强行开始测量。10月1日，冲绳岛首府那霸的居民利用无线电话鼓舞砂川町居民的斗争。砂川町的居民回答说：“让我们携起手来，因为我们是共命运的。”
    面临着人民的强烈反对，日本政府已经把它在砂川町开始测量的日期推迟到10月5日。
