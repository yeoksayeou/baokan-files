In the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall at the Temple of Azure Clouds
Liu Shiping Fu Dong

The ninetieth anniversary of the birth of the great revolutionary and patriot, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, is coming soon, so we made a special visit to the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall at the Temple of Azure Clouds in the Western Hills of Beijing. Climbing up the stone steps of the Temple of Azure Clouds, we soon arrived at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. There, a group of people were gathered around an explanatory sign, looking at it. The sign read: "Sun Yat-sen was a great democratic revolutionary in modern China." It then briefly introduced Sun Yat-sen's life and concluded with: Sun Yat-sen "died of illness in Beijing on March 12, 1925, and his remains were placed in the stone pagoda of the Temple of Azure Clouds. In 1929, he was reburied in the Purple Mountain in Nanjing. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall was rebuilt to permanently commemorate the Chinese people's high respect for Sun Yat-sen."

People who visited the Temple of Azure Clouds before liberation can still remember the desolate scene at that time. The courtyard was full of weeds, and it was difficult to get to the Temple of Azure Clouds from the city. A car ride involved bouncing for more than an hour on bumpy roads. Now, not only is the memorial hall painted brilliantly, but the government has also repaired the road here, making it smooth and leading directly to the gate.

Upon entering the memorial hall, the first thing that catches the eye is the glass-covered steel coffin. This was sent to Beijing by the Soviet Union on March 30, 1925, by special personnel. At that time, Mr. Sun Yat-sen had already been in his coffin for half a month, so it was not used. Now it is placed in the memorial hall to express gratitude for the friendship of the Soviet people.

Stonemasons are carving "Sun Yat-sen's Testament to the Soviet Union" on the smooth Quyang stone on both sides of the memorial hall. The testament was written by Mr. Sun Yat-sen on the day before his death (March 11, 1925). They are carving it carefully, word by word, striving to complete it before Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday anniversary this year.

This testament is precious. From it, we can see Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great revolutionary thought and his trust in Sino-Soviet friendship.

In the main hall of the memorial hall, there are also Mr. Sun Yat-sen's writings, calligraphy, and personal belongings from his lifetime. The two wings of the memorial hall are set up as two exhibition rooms. From the first exhibition room, we can see Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary activities in the various periods before the May Fourth Movement. In 1866, he was born into a peasant family in Cuiheng Village, Xiangshan County (now Zhongshan County), Guangdong. At that time, imperialist countries were colluding with the Qing government, trying to divide China, causing the people of the whole country to live in misery. Therefore, after the Opium War, there was first the Taiping Rebellion, followed by the Boxer Rebellion against imperialism. This made Mr. Sun Yat-sen increasingly aware that to save China, it was necessary to oppose imperialism and feudal rule. After repeated failures in the revolution, whether he was in exile abroad, imprisoned in London, or suffering on warships at home, Mr. Sun Yat-sen was never discouraged and continued to carry out revolutionary activities with unyielding determination.

This exhibition hall also displays two famous works written by Lenin in 1912 and 1913, "On the Chinese Revolution" and "Backward Europe and Advanced Asia." The articles condemned the imperialist countries' criminal activities of supporting Yuan Shikai with loans, and at the same time expressed strong support for the Chinese revolution. Lenin's works made Mr. Sun Yat-sen realize who were the friends and enemies of the Chinese people.

In the second exhibition room, photos of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's activities after the October Revolution and the May Fourth Movement are displayed. This was a pivotal period of change in which Mr. Sun Yat-sen constantly learned from failures and continuously strove for progress according to the needs of reality.

The victory of the October Socialist Revolution brought new hope to the Chinese people. Now, in the glass cabinets of the exhibition room, people can see images of the cover of the earliest Chinese translation of the "Communist Manifesto" and photos of Li Dazhao's article "The Victory of Bolshevism." They can also see the grand and vigorous scenes of workers and students marching and demonstrating in Beijing and Shanghai during the May Fourth Movement, and the cover of the inaugural issue of the "Guide" weekly newspaper, founded in 1922 after the founding of the Communist Party of China.

The victory of the October Revolution gave Mr. Sun Yat-sen great inspiration and encouragement. In the exhibition room, there is a picture of a letter he wrote to the Soviet government, revealing Mr. Sun Yat-sen's deep desire to establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union.

People can also see a photo of Mr. Sun Yat-sen with a Soviet representative. This was taken in 1922 when Chen Jiongming colluded with the Northern Warlords to launch a rebellion. Mr. Sun Yat-sen went to Shanghai to meet with Soviet representatives to discuss establishing friendly relations. At that time, the great leader of China's bourgeois revolution extended a hand of friendship to the newly emerging proletarian state.

Standing in front of a glass cabinet, visitors pointed to the photos with delight, saying, "This is Chairman Mao!" "This is Comrade Li Dazhao!" These photos were taken during the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang in January 1924. Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Li Dazhao, among others, participated in this meeting. It was at this meeting that Sun Yat-sen accepted the suggestions of the Chinese Communist Party and adopted the three major policies of revolution: "Alliance with Russia, Alliance with the Communist Party, and Assistance to Peasants and Workers." Mr. Sun Yat-sen reorganized the Kuomintang with new ideas that conformed to the new era of the Chinese revolution, uniting the Kuomintang with the struggle of the broad masses of people.

From then on, Mr. Sun Yat-sen escaped the isolated and helpless situation he had been in during the anti-warlord struggles since the Xinhai Revolution. The pictures tell people how, with the support of the Soviet Union, the Chinese Communist Party, and the workers and peasants, he founded the Whampoa Military Academy, suppressed the armed rebellion of the comprador class in Guangzhou instigated by imperialism, and prepared for the Northern Expedition.

In order to strive for the convocation of a National Assembly and the abolition of unequal treaties, Mr. Sun Yat-sen went north in November 1924. The picture of him arriving in Beijing while ill left a deep impression on people.

At the highest peak of the Temple of Azure Clouds, the stone pagoda, people were gathered around the Sun Yat-sen cenotaph. The pagoda is 34.7 meters high. Here, tourists can overlook the scenery of Fragrant Hills, and the ancient pagoda on Jade Spring Mountain and the Cloud-Dispelling Hall on Longevity Hill in the distance are also clearly visible. The cenotaph contains Mr. Sun Yat-sen's clothes and hat that he wore before his death, as well as a Phoebe nanmu coffin.

There is an old man guarding the tomb here, Tan Huiquan, who was Mr. Sun Yat-sen's bodyguard during his lifetime. He came here from Guangdong to guard the tomb in the year of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death. For thirty years, he has never left Beijing. This year he is eighty-three years old. He told us about the sorrowful mourning of the masses at the time of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death.

From the memories of this old member of the Tongmenghui, Tan Huiquan, and the historical materials displayed in the exhibition hall, people deeply feel that although Mr. Sun Yat-sen has passed away, his revolutionary thought and great personality will forever live in the hearts of the revolutionary Chinese people.

    在碧云寺的中山纪念堂里
    刘时平　傅冬
    伟大的革命家和爱国者——孙中山先生的九十诞辰快来了，我们特地访问了北京西山的碧云寺的中山纪念堂。沿着碧云寺的石台阶一层一层上去，没多久就到了中山纪念堂。在那里，一群人正围着说明牌在观看。牌上写着：“孙中山是中国近代伟大的民主主义革命家”，接着简单扼要地介绍了孙中山的生平，最后写着：孙中山“1925年3月12日在北京患病逝世，停灵于碧云寺石塔中。1929年迁葬于南京紫金山。中华人民共和国成立后，重建中山纪念堂，永志中国人民对孙中山的崇高敬意。”
    解放前到过碧云寺的人都还能记得起那时碧云寺的荒凉景象。那时满院是草，从城里到碧云寺来一趟好不容易，坐汽车要在坑坑凹凹的公路上颠一个多钟头，现在不但纪念堂油漆得金碧辉煌，连到这里的马路，政府也给修得平平的，并且直达大门口了。
    进了纪念堂，首先引人注目的是那口玻璃盖钢棺。这是苏联在1925年3月30日派专人送到北京的。当时中山先生已入殓半月，不及使用。现在把它摆在纪念堂里，表示对苏联人民友谊的感谢。
    石工们正在纪念堂内两边墙上光滑的曲阳石上雕刻“孙中山致苏联遗书”，遗书是在中山先生临终前一日（1925年3月11日）写的。他们认真地一个字一个字地雕刻着，争取在今年中山先生诞辰纪念日以前完成。
    这封遗书是宝贵的，从这封遗书中可以看到中山先生伟大的革命思想和对中苏友谊的信赖。
    在纪念堂的正厅，还有中山先生生前的遗著、遗墨、遗物。纪念堂的两边厢房，设有两个展览室。从第一展览室中，我们可以看到中山先生在“五四”以前各个时期的革命活动。1866年他出生在广东香山县（今中山县）翠亨村一个农民家庭。当时帝国主义国家正在勾结清朝政府，想瓜分中国，害得全国民不聊生，因此在鸦片战争后，先有太平军的起义，后有义和团的反帝运动。这使中山先生日益认识到要想救中国，必须要反对帝国主义和封建统治。中山先生在屡次革命失败以后，无论逃亡国外，被囚伦敦，或者在国内兵舰上受难，都没有灰心，百折不挠地继续进行革命活动。
    在这个展览馆中还陈列了列宁在1912年和1913年写的“关于中国革命”和“落后的欧洲与先进的亚洲”两篇名著，文中指责当时帝国主义国家借款支持袁世凯的罪恶活动；同时表示了对中国革命的有力声援和支持。列宁的这些著作使中山先生认识到谁是中国人民的朋友，谁是中国人民的敌人。
    在第二展览室，陈列着十月革命和“五四”运动后中山先生活动的照片。这是中山先生不断地从失败中取得教训，并根据现实的需要不断地争取进步的划时代的转变时期心情。
    十月社会主义革命的胜利给中国人民带来了新的曙光。现在在展览室的玻璃柜里，人们可以看到“共产党宣言”最早的中译本封面的图片、李大钊写的“布尔什维克主义胜利”一文的照片；也可以从图片上看到“五四”运动时，北京和上海的工人、学生游行示威的轰轰烈烈的场面；还可以看到中国共产党成立后，在1922年创刊的
  “向导”周报创刊号封面的图片。
    十月革命的胜利，给了中山先生很大的启示和鼓舞。展览室有一张图片照的是他写给苏联政府的一封信，信里显露了中山先生盼望同苏联建立友好关系的深切心情。
    人们还可以看到一张中山先生和苏联代表合照的像片。这是1922年陈炯明勾结北洋军阀举行叛变，中山先生跑到上海和苏联代表会谈建立友好关系时拍摄的。中国这一资产阶级革命的伟大领袖在那时已经向新兴的无产阶级国家伸出了友谊之手。
    站在一个玻璃柜前参观的人们一面看，一面高兴地指着像片说：“这一位是毛主席！”“这一位是李大钊同志！”这是1924年1月中国国民党第一次全国代表大会开会时拍的照片，这次会议毛泽东同志和李大钊同志等都参加了。就在这次会上孙中山接受中国共产党的建议，采取“联俄、联共、扶助农工”的革命三大政策。中山先生以符合中国革命新时期的新思想改组了国民党。使国民党和广大人民的斗争结合起来。
    中山先生从此摆脱了辛亥革命以来在反军阀斗争中孤立无援的状况。图片告诉人们，他以后怎样在苏联、中国共产党人和工农群众的支援下，创办了黄埔军官学校，怎样镇压了帝国主义策动的广州买办阶级的武装商团叛乱，又怎样准备了北伐战争。
    为了争取召开国民会议和废除不平等条约，孙中山先生在1924年11月北上。他扶病到北京的像片给人留下了深刻的印象。
    在碧云寺的最高峰——石塔，人们都在围观中山先生衣冠冢。塔高三十四点七公尺，游人在这里，可以俯瞰香山的景色，远处玉泉山上的古塔和万寿山上的排云殿，也历历在目。衣冠冢里封的有中山先生临死前穿的衣服和戴的帽子，还有一口楠木棺材。
    在这里，有位护陵的老先生谭惠全，他是中山先生生前的卫士，从中山先生逝世那年，他就从广东来这里护陵，三十年来，一直没有离开北京。今年他已有八十三岁，他向我们叙述了中山先生逝世时群众沉痛悼念的情景。
    从这个老同盟会员谭惠全的回忆和展览室陈列的史料中，使人深深感觉到中山先生虽然与世长辞，但是他的革命思想和伟大人格还永远活在革命的中国人民的心目中。（附图片）
