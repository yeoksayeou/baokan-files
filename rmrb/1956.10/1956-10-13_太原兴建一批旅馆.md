    Taiyuan is Building a Batch of Hotels
    (Our Newspaper) Taiyuan: Due to the development of industrial construction and the increase in the urban population, the original hotels in Taiyuan have become insufficient. Currently, seven to eight hundred people are staying at the train station or under the eaves every day because they cannot find a hotel.
    In order to solve this problem, the Taiyuan Welfare Company and the Commercial Bureau are building a batch of hotels near the train station. More than 70 bungalows have already been built. More than 200 bungalows and a five-story building of more than 6,700 square meters, which are under construction or are about to be constructed, will all be completed by the end of the year and before February or March of next year.

    太原兴建一批旅馆
    本报讯　太原市正在兴建一批旅馆。太原市由于工业建设的发展和城市人口的增加，原有的旅馆已感不足，现在每天都有七、八百人因找不到旅店，住宿在车站或房檐下。
    为了解决这个问题，太原市福利公司和商业局在车站附近兴建一批旅馆，目前已经建起七十余间平房。正在或准备修建中的二百余间平房和一幢六千七百多平方公尺的五层大楼，将分别在年底和明年二、三月以前全部竣工。
