The Soviet Union Continues to Expand Foreign Cultural Ties
Chinese Literary Books in the Soviet Union

In the Soviet Union, Chinese books can be found in libraries and bookstores in any city. According to materials from the Soviet Publishing Administration, during the Soviet era, the Soviet Union published a total of 350 books by 56 Chinese authors; these books were published in 31 languages, with a total circulation of over 16.6 million copies. The most published Chinese literary works in the Soviet Union are those by Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Liu Baiyu, Zhao Shuli, and Zhou Libo. The Soviet State Literary Books Publishing House is now preparing to publish a three-volume selected works of Ba Jin, a three-volume selected works of Lao She, as well as selected works by Li Bai, Bai Juyi, Pu Songling, Lu Xun, Qu Qiubai, Ye Shengtao, and others.

Crystallization of Friendship in Film Industry
Recently, an American film industrialist, Mr. Torsd, arrived in Moscow to discuss the joint production of films with Soviet film workers. He greatly admired Soviet ballet, opera, and acrobatics, and suggested first co-producing a film about Soviet art.

Korean writers Kim Seong-gu, Seo Man-il, and Soviet writer Birventsev are finishing the writing of a film script. This film depicts a Korean family divided by the "38th parallel" and reflects the assistance of Soviet and people's democratic countries' experts to the Korean people.

A film about Dimitrov, an outstanding activist in the international workers' movement, "Lessons of History" is currently in production. The events in the film unfold in Berlin, Leipzig, Paris, Copenhagen, New York, and other places. It describes the German working class, the underground group of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and the struggle of world progressive forces against war and fascism. Dimitrov in the film is played by Bulgarian Meritorious Actor Shavov, and other roles are played by Bulgarian and Soviet actors.

Soviet and Indian film studios are jointly producing the film "Nikitin's Journey." This film depicts the story of the first European to travel to India—the Russian merchant Nikitin. The Indian actors have already been selected: the female lead in the film "The Vagabond" plays the Indian rural girl that Nikitin falls in love with; the male lead in the Indian film "Two Acres of Land" plays Nikitin's good friend. The Soviet photography team will go to India in October to shoot outdoor scenes and some indoor scenes, and filming will continue in Moscow this winter. Indian actors and musicians will participate in this work.

French People Love Pushkin's Works
In order to publish a complete collection of Pushkin's works in France, Anne Meunier, a French literary researcher who is proficient in Pushkin's works, recently arrived in Leningrad from Paris. He is currently studying Pushkin's manuscripts at the Institute of Russian Literature of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In an interview with a reporter from the Soviet "Literary Gazette," he said: "The French people became interested in the works of the great Russian poet Pushkin as early as during his lifetime. In 1821, a collection of Pushkin's poems was published in France; works such as 'The Queen of Spades' and 'The Captain's Daughter' have been reprinted more than 30 times. In 1953, we published the first volume of the complete works of the great Russian poet, with a total of 750 pages, and more than 700 copies were sold in the first few days of distribution. The French people also particularly like the works of Tolstoy, Turgenev, Chekhov, Gogol, and Gorky."

    苏联不断扩大对外文化联系
    中国文学书籍在苏联
    在苏联，任何一个城市的图书馆和书店里都有中国书籍。据苏联出版总署的材料，在苏维埃政权年代苏联一共出版了五十六个中国作家的三百五十种书；这些书用三十一种语言出版，总数达一千六百余万册。苏联出版的中国文学书籍中最多的是鲁迅、郭沫若、茅盾、刘白羽、赵树理、周立波的作品。苏联国家文艺书籍出版局现在准备出版巴金作品选集三卷集、老舍文选三卷集以及李白、白居易、蒲松龄、鲁迅、瞿秋白、叶圣陶等的选集。
    电影事业上的友谊结晶
    最近一位美国的电影工业家托尔德到了莫斯科，同苏联电影工作者商量共同摄制影片的问题。他非常欣赏苏联的芭蕾舞、歌剧、杂技，并建议首先共同摄制一部关于苏联艺术的影片。
    朝鲜作家金城古、徐万一和苏联作家毕尔文采夫正在结束一部电影剧本的写作。这个电影描写一个被“三八线”分割的朝鲜家庭，并反映苏联和人民民主国家的专家们对朝鲜人民的帮助。
    一部关于国际工人运动的杰出活动家季米特洛夫的电影“历史的教训”正在拍制中。电影中的事件发展在柏林、莱比锡、巴黎、哥本哈根、纽约等地。它描述了德国的工人阶级，保加利亚共产党的地下小组，以及关于世界进步力量反对战争和法西斯的斗争。电影中的季米特洛夫由保加利亚功勋演员沙沃夫扮演，其他角色由保加利亚和苏联的演员扮演。
    苏联和印度的制片厂正在共同拍制影片“尼基金的旅行”。这部电影描写欧洲第一个到印度的人——俄国商人尼基金在印度旅行的故事。印度的演员已经选好了：扮演尼基金所恋爱的印度农村姑娘的是电影“流浪者”中的女主角；印度电影“两亩地”里的男主角扮演尼基金的好友。苏联摄影组10月里就要到印度去摄外景和一部分内景，今年冬天将在莫斯科继续拍制。印度的演员和音乐家都将参加这个工作。
    法国人喜爱普希金的著作
    为了在法国出版一套完整的普希金全集，一位精通普希金作品的法国文学研究家安·梅尼奥最近从巴黎到了列宁格勒。现在，他正在苏联科学院俄罗斯文学研究所里研究普希金的手稿。他在同苏联“文学报”记者谈话中说道：“法国人民早在伟大俄国诗人普希金生前的时候就对他的作品发生了兴趣。1821年在法国就出版了普希金的诗集；‘黑桃皇后’、‘上尉的女儿’等作品都再版了三十多次。1953年我们出版了伟大俄国诗人全集的第一卷，共七百五十页，在发行的头几天就售出了七百多册。法国人也特别喜欢托尔斯泰、屠格?夫、契呵夫、果戈里和高尔基的著品。”
