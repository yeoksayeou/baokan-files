Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 18th. Hebei Province recently held a coal mine industrial safety production experience exchange meeting, exchanging experiences gained by various mines in promoting the "Four Safeties" of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine.

The "Four Safeties" of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine are advanced experiences affirmed at the National Coal Mine Advanced Producers Representatives Conference. This mine has maintained a record of safe production for a long time by making safety work "systematic, planned, mass-based, and disciplined."

Kailuan Tangjiazhuang Coal Mine and Jingxing Coal Mine No. 2 Mine comprehensively introduced the effectiveness and experience gained since the implementation of the "Four Safeties" at the meeting. Both coal mines have included safety production plans on the agenda of Party organizations and stipulated a series of rules and regulations, such as no work is allowed without an operation plan. This has further strengthened technical management and powerfully guaranteed safe production. Kailuan Tangjiazhuang Coal Mine has now basically eliminated the accidents of roof collapse and gas accumulation at the working face, and has overfulfilled the production plan every month for more than half a year.

The Fengfeng Coal Mine No. 1 Mine and the local state-owned Xiahuayuan Coal Mine also introduced their experiences at the meeting. They respectively introduced the experience of eliminating flying tank accidents and the experience of the Communist Youth League supervision post work.

The meeting decided to print these experiences into booklets and promote them universally.

This newspaper reports that the Pingxiang Coal Mine Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to carry out a comprehensive safety and quality inspection in the fourth quarter to ensure the completion of production and capital construction tasks with "more, faster, better, and more economical" results, and to implement the resolutions of the Eighth National Congress of the Party with practical actions.

The Party Committee decided to start the inspection in October, first by contacting individuals to check the problems existing in safety and quality work. For cadres, the emphasis is on checking the implementation of policies and the mass viewpoint from the perspective of guiding ideology. For workers, the emphasis is on checking the mentality of taking chances and narrow empiricism. It is required to: improve work while inspecting.

The Party Committee particularly pointed out that in this inspection, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party and implement the mass line. All functional departments should conduct inspections based on the problems identified by the production units, combined with the work of their own departments. The trade union and the Communist Youth League should mobilize and organize the masses to participate in the safety and quality inspection work. The cultural, educational and publicity departments, clubs, and family work should also organize activities around this safety inspection work.

    新华社保定18日电　河北省最近召开煤矿工业安全生产经验交流会议，交流了各矿推行焦作煤矿“安全四化”中取得的经验。
    焦作煤矿的“安全四化”是全国煤矿先进生产者代表会议上肯定的先进经验。这个矿由于把安全工作做到了“制度化、计划化、群众化和纪律化”，曾经长期保持了安全生产的成绩。
    开滦唐家庄煤矿和井陉煤矿第二矿，在会上全面介绍了推行“安全四化”以来获得的成效和经验。这两个煤矿都把安全生产计划列入了党组织的议事日程，规定了没有作业计划不准开工等一系列的规程制度，进一步加强了技术管理，有力地保证了安全生产。开滦唐家庄煤矿现在已经基本上消灭了工作面垮顶和瓦斯积存的事故，近半年多来，月月超额完成生产计划。
    在会上介绍经验的还有峰峰煤矿第一矿和地方国营下花园煤矿等单位。他们分别介绍了杜绝飞罐事故的经验和青年团监督岗工作的经验等。
    会议决定把这些经验印成小册子，普遍推广。
    本报讯　中共萍乡煤矿委员会决定第四季度全面开展安全质量大检查，以保证“多、快、好、省”地完成生产、基本建设任务，用实际行动贯彻党的第八次全国代表大会决议。
    党委决定从10月份起开始进行检查，首先联系个人检查有关安全质量工作中所存在的问题。对干部强调从指导思想方面检查执行政策情况和群众观点。对工人则强调检查侥幸心理和狭隘经验主义。要求做到：一边检查，一边改进工作。
    党委特别指出在这一次检查中，要加强党的领导，贯彻群众路线。各职能科室应根据生产单位检查出来的问题，结合本部门工作进行检查。工会和青年团应很好地发动和组织群众参加安全质量检查工作。文教宣传部门、俱乐部和家属工作也要围绕这次安全检查工作组织活动。
