	New Fountain Pen Accessories
	Fountain pens are almost indispensable in people's cultural lives. People long for a practical and beautiful fountain pen that can hold a lot of ink without leaking, has an appealing appearance, and is also very affordable.
	Now, this hope has become a reality.

	Folding Ink Sac
	For decades, the ink-filling method of our country's fountain pens has remained unchanged: a long, round ink sac, pressed with copper sheets, which is both laborious and absorbs little ink. After learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, the Shanghai Joint State-Private Hua Fu Fountain Pen Factory successfully trial-produced a folding ink sac. Its ink capacity is more than half greater than the old-fashioned ink sac, and it is equipped with a transparent plastic press head, using exhaust pressure. This saves metal materials, reduces costs, and requires less effort when filling ink.
	This type of ink sac is now in mass production.

	Model 55 Pen Feed
	The pen feed of a fountain pen is the main accessory for conveying ink. In the past, fountain pens often leaked because climate changes and air pressure forced ink into the pen feed, which couldn't contain it, causing it to drip out.
	The Shanghai Joint State-Private Jin Xing Pen Factory recently manufactured a Model 55 pen feed that can hold the ink in the pen feed and prevent it from leaking. This solves the long-standing problem of fountain pen leakage.

	Block-Pattern Celluloid Pen Barrel
	Most fountain pen barrels are black or blue, which can be monotonous and boring to look at every day.
	The Shanghai Joint State-Private Guan Le Ming Fountain Pen Factory uses domestically produced raw materials to make block-pattern celluloid pen barrels. These pen barrels are brightly colored, beautiful and elegant, heat-resistant, non-fading, and have no extensibility. Its physical and technical measurements fully meet the standards.

### 自来水笔新配件

    自来水笔新配件
    人们的文化生活里，几乎经常离不开自来水笔。人们多么想望着能有一种实用美观的自来水笔，可以大量吸水，但又不漏水；外表看来令人喜爱，但售价又很便宜。
    现在，这样的希望已经成为事实了。
    折叠式笔胆
    我国自来水笔的吸水方法，几十年来一成不变：长圆的笔胆、用铜片揿压，既费功夫，吸水又少。上海公私合营华孚金笔厂学习苏联先进经验后，试制折叠式笔胆成功，吸水量比老式笔胆增加一半以上，而且配用透明的塑胶揿头，利用排气揿压，既节约金属原料，降低成本，又能在吸水时不费气力。
    现在这类笔胆已经开始大量生产。
    55型笔舌
    自来水笔的笔舌，是输送墨水的主要配件。过去的自来水笔常常漏水，就是因为气候变化，受到空气压力，把墨水挤到笔舌里，笔舌又容纳不下，就滴漏下来。
    上海公私合营金星笔厂最近制成的一种55型笔舌，能吸住笔舌里的墨水，不让它漏出。长期以来自来水笔的漏水问题从此解决了。
    块花赛珞璐料的笔杆
    一般自来水笔杆，大都是黑色的，或蓝色的，成天看到它，有些单调乏味之感。
    上海公私合营关勒铭金笔厂利用国产原料，制成块花赛珞璐料的笔杆。这种笔杆色泽鲜艳，美观大方，能耐热，不变色，没有伸缩性，它的物理技术测定完全符合标准。
