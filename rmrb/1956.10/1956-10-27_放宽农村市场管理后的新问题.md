Editor's Note: Recently, many places have opened free markets under state leadership, relaxing the management of rural markets, and have achieved good results, but at the same time, some new problems have also emerged. We are now publishing a selection of the situations received by the editorial department below for relevant leading departments to study and resolve.

	Small Vendors Hoard and Raise Prices

	After the relaxation of rural market management in various parts of Sichuan Province, new problems have also emerged, the most prominent of which is reflected in prices. In Yongxing Market, Sixth District, Mianyang, outside vendors, in order to make high profits, sold dried Jerusalem artichokes (dried vegetables) worth 76 cents per jin at 25 cents per liang, with a gross profit of 3.24 yuan per jin. In Yibin market, the price of eggs was originally 30 cents for ten, but now it is selling for about 60 cents. The purchase price of green hemp in Luxian County is 70-80 cents per jin, but the market price has risen to more than one yuan. When Chongqing vendors went to Huayang to buy Cangxi pears, the local (suburban Chengdu) top-grade price was 33 yuan per 100 jin, but these vendors bought them at a high price of 46 yuan per 100 jin, which affected the market price in Chengdu.

	The result of vendors hoarding and raising market prices not only increases the burden on consumers but also causes some farmers to be uneasy about agricultural production. At present, in Changshou, Mianyang, and other places, there are farmers who have abandoned agriculture for commerce. For example, some farmers in some agricultural cooperatives in the Fourth District of Mianyang do not participate in agricultural production but instead engage in the transportation and sale of chicken and duck eggs, and no one harvests the ripe millet in the cooperative. More than 20 farmer-merchant households in the Seventh District recently planned to hand over their land and apply to specialize in commerce.　Tian Qiyu

	More Unlicensed Vendors

	After the opening of free markets under state leadership in Nanchang, Ganzhou, Jingdezhen, and other places in Jiangxi Province, many unlicensed intermediate vendors have emerged. Most of them are residents without occupations who intercept and purchase farmers' agricultural and sideline products outside the city, transport them into the city and sell them, making a profit from the difference. Because they do not have business licenses and do not pay taxes, they raise the purchase price of goods, which affects the supply of goods for state-owned companies and licensed vendors. The fresh fish cooperative group in Taihe County, Jiangxi Province, had a turnover of 250 yuan in mid-September. After the opening of the free market, the turnover in late September decreased to 150 yuan due to a reduction in supply.　Wang Xian

	Cross-Regional Price Gouging to Buy Live Pigs

	Food companies in Hubei, Anhui, and other places went to various parts of Henan to raise prices to buy live pigs after the relaxation of rural market management. The Tianshui sales office of the Macheng County Food Company in Hubei Province purchased live pigs in Wangzhai Township, Huaibin County, Henan, and other places at a high price of 60 cents per jin, and also entrusted farmers to purchase live pigs on their behalf by giving them a handling fee of one yuan per pig. In September, 35,000 live pigs were snatched away from Xinyang Prefecture, Henan.　Zhao Ju

### 放宽农村市场管理后的新问题

    放宽农村市场管理后的新问题
    编者按：最近期间，不少地方开辟了国家领导下的自由市场，放宽对农村市场的管理，收到了良好的效果，但同时也出现一些新的问题。现在把编辑部收到的情况，选登一部分在下面，以供有关领导部门研究解决。
    小商贩哄抬价格
    四川省各地农村市场放宽管理后，也出现了新的问题，最突出的表现在价格上。绵阳六区永兴场外来商贩为了牟取高利，把每斤价值七角六分的雪芋精（干菜），以每两二角五分出售，每斤毛利高达三元二角四分。宜宾市场的鸡蛋价格原来是十个卖三角钱，现卖到六角左右。泸县青麻收购牌价每斤七、八角，市价已涨到一元多。重庆商贩到华阳买苍溪梨时，当地（成都市郊）上等价三十三元一百斤，这些商贩却出四十六元一百斤的高价收购，影响了成都市价。
    商贩哄抬市价的结果，不仅增加了消费者的负担，也引起了部分农民不安心农业生产。目前，在长寿、绵阳等地，都发现有农民弃农经商的现象。如绵阳四区有个别农业社的一些农民，不参加农业生产，而去从事鸡、鸭蛋的贩运，社里的谷子黄了也无人收割。七区有二十余户农兼商的农民，最近打算交出土地，申请专门经商。　田祈雨
    没执照的商贩增多
    江西省南昌、赣州、景德镇等地开放了国家领导下的自由市场后，出现了许多没有营业执照的中间商贩。他们多数是没有职业的居民，在城外拦路收购农民的农副业产品，运进城内转手出售，从中获得利润。由于他们没有营业执照，不纳税，就抬价收购货物，使国营公司和有执照的商贩的货源受到影响。江西泰和县鲜鱼合作小组，9月中旬营业额达二百五十元，开放自由市场后，因货源减少，9月下旬营业额下降为一百五十元。　王咸
    越区抬价抢购生猪
    湖北、安徽等地食品公司，在放宽农村市场管理后，到河南各地抬价收购生猪。湖北麻城县食品公司夭水营业处，以每斤六角的高价，在河南淮滨县王寨乡等地抢购生猪，还以每头猪给手续费一元的方法，委托农民代购生猪。河南信阳专区9月份被外区抢购走生猪三万五千头。　赵举
