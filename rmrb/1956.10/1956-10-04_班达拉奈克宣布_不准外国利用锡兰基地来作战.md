Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 3rd: According to a Colombo October 1st dispatch: Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike told the ruling party's parliamentary group, "Regardless of whether there is war or not, I will not allow our bases to be used by any national bloc to conduct war actions."

He said that he had asked Britain to guarantee that in the event of a war before the Trincomalee naval base and Katunayake air force base were returned to Ceylon, these bases would not be used.

Bandaranaike said that Britain had assured Ceylon that if a war broke out over the Suez Canal issue, Britain would not use its naval and air force bases on the island nation.

Bandaranaike later told the House of Representatives that the British government had reaffirmed its decision: in the event of war, it would not use these two bases.

In explaining Ceylon's attitude towards the Suez Canal issue, he said, "If war breaks out, I am not prepared to throw our country into the war; we will continue to maintain neutrality in the war."

    班达拉奈克宣布
    不准外国利用锡兰基地来作战
    新华社新德里3日电　据科伦坡10月1日消息：锡兰总理班达拉奈克对执政党的议会党团说，“不管有没有战争，我将不容许我们的基地被任何国家集团利用来进行战争行动。”
    他说，他已经要求英国保证，万一在亭可马里海军基地和卡图那雅克空军基地归还锡兰以前发生了战争，这些基地将不被使用。
    班达拉奈克说，英国已经向锡兰保证，假如因苏伊士运河问题而爆发战争，英国将不使用它在这个岛国上的海空军基地。
    班达拉奈克后来对众议院说，英国政府已经重申它的决定：万一发生战争，将不使用这两个基地。
    他在解释锡兰对苏伊士运河问题的态度的时候说，“假使战争爆发，我不准备把我国投入战争，我们将在战争中继续保持中立。”
