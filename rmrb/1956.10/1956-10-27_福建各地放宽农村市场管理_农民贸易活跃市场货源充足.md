Fujian Province has relaxed its management of rural markets since mid-August. Farmers' trade has immediately become active, and small vendors have ample supplies.

Currently, the market volume of various small-scale agricultural and sideline products has generally increased in various places. For example, chicken and duck eggs, which were difficult to find in the past, are now appearing on the market in large numbers. In Fuzhou, farmers selling live chickens have appeared. Since the opening of the market in Baisha Town, Minhou, in mid-August, the variety of goods has increased by twenty-eight kinds, most of which are handicrafts and agricultural and sideline products, and the number of farmers entering the market has increased several times. Minhou County only purchased 32 dan of Roulang in January and February, but received 900 dan in September. In Youxi County, Roulang was rarely or never on the market in the past, but now it can purchase 600 dan per month. The market volume of charcoal and firewood has increased in various places, and the tense supply and demand situation has eased. In Yuqi Town, Fuqing County, residents used to need a certificate from the town government and approval from the food company to buy a chicken, but now they can buy it freely on the market; piglets were very scarce in the past, but now they cannot be sold out every day. From these facts, it can be seen that the rural market in various places has indeed begun to become active, and small vendors are like fish in water in the free market.

After the opening of the rural free market, the prices of various commodities fluctuated somewhat, but the range is generally considered normal. In Yuqi Town, Fuqing County, the price of piglets was previously set at 0.65 to 0.72 yuan per catty, but now the market price is up to 0.85 yuan; the food company in Shanggan Town, Minhou County, purchases ducks at 0.4 yuan per catty. The price sold by farmers is also 0.4 yuan, and at most not more than 0.6 yuan.

Many facts show that the opening of the free market has stimulated farmers' enthusiasm for production and small vendors' enthusiasm for doing business. For example, the output of small local products such as Eucommia ulmoides roots, Roulang, and ginger in Yongtai County has increased; in some areas, agricultural cooperatives have increased their plans for raising ducks, geese, and growing vegetables.

Since the opening of the rural free market, some new problems have also arisen. For example, the market prices in various places are generally higher than the state's purchase prices, so agricultural cooperatives are unwilling to fulfill supply and marketing contracts and even return deposits to supply and marketing cooperatives. Agricultural cooperatives in Zhangpu County do not fulfill contracts and sell their products on their own; farmers in Liancheng County are willing to sell soil paper, porcelain bowls, live pigs, peanuts, and other products on their own or through small vendors who go to the countryside to purchase and sell, which affects the completion of the supply and marketing cooperative's purchase tasks. Also, because the free market is profitable, farmers and agricultural cooperatives are more willing to engage in business on their own, which affects the business of small vendors. For example, persimmons from the Third District Agricultural Cooperative in Yongding County are sold by the members in various villages; the Xinqiao District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Youxi County reflects that some agricultural cooperatives also engage in small commodities, rock candy, and cuttlefish, and use farmers with original commercial habits to operate industrial products as the collective sideline production of the cooperative; The Nakou Town Agricultural Cooperative in Shaowu County even opened a shop to sell noodles, buns, and dumplings. In addition, in the markets in border areas, the price increase is relatively large. (Fujian Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative)

    福建各地放宽农村市场管理
    农民贸易活跃市场货源充足
    本报讯　福建省各地自8月中旬放宽对农村市场管理以后，农民贸易立即活跃，小商贩货源充足。
    目前，各地小宗的多种多样农副产品上市量普遍增加，如鸡鸭蛋过去是不易见到的，现在纷纷上市了。福州市已出现挑卖活鸡的农民。闽侯白沙镇自8月中旬开放市场后，品种增加了二十八种，其中大部分是手工业品及农副产品，上市农民增加了好几倍。闽侯全县在1月和2月份，只收购茹榔三十二担，9月份却收到了九百担。尤溪县过去茹榔上市很少，甚至没有，现在每月能收购六百担。各地木炭、木柴的上市量都有增加，供求紧张的现象已趋缓和。福清县渔溪镇居民过去买一只鸡需要镇公所证明，食品公司批准才买得到，现在可以在市上随意买到；过去小猪很紧张，现在每天销不完。从这些事实看，各地农村市场确已开始活跃，小商贩有了自由市场就像如鱼得水一样。
    开放农村自由市场后，各种商品价格有些波动，但是幅度一般还算正常。福清县渔溪镇小猪价格过去规定每斤六角五分至七角二分，现在市场价格最高是八角五分；闽侯县尚干镇食品公司收购鸭价每斤四角。农民出售的价也是四角，最多不超过六角。
    很多事实说明，开放自由市场后，刺激了农民生产的积极性，也刺激了小商贩做生意的积极性。例如，永泰县的小土产杜仲根、茹榔、生姜的产量有了增加；有些地区农业合作社养鸭、养鹅和种蔬菜的计划都加大了。
    开放农村自由市场以后，也发生了一些新的问题。例如各地市价普遍高于国家的收购价格，农业社因此不愿执行供销合同，甚至把订金退还供销社。漳浦县农业社不执行合同，自行销售产品；连城县土纸、瓷碗、毛猪、花生等产品，农民都愿自销或由小贩下乡购销，影响了供销社收购任务的完成。也由于自由市场有利可图，农民和农业社多愿自行经商，结果影响了小商贩的营业。如永定县三区农业社的柿子都由社员串乡售卖；尤溪县新桥区供销社反映：有的农业社兼营小百货、冰糖、目鱼，并利用原有商业习惯的农民经营工业品作为社的集体副业生产；邵武县拿口镇农业社竟开铺子卖面条、包子和水饺。另外，在边界地区的市场，价格上涨幅度较大。　（福建省供销合作社）
