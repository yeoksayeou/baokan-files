    Visiting Nanjing's Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum

    At the foot of Purple Mountain in Nanjing stands a magnificent, nationally styled, bell-shaped mausoleum: the world-renowned Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum.

    This mausoleum is as tall as a building of more than ten stories, and from the mausoleum gate to the memorial hall, it is necessary to climb three hundred and twenty-eight steps paved with granite. The memorial hall and the burial chamber are constructed of marble and granite, with blue glazed roof tiles that glisten. The mausoleum, composed of more than 40,000 mu of trees, flowers, and plants, encircles this magnificent building, resembling a shining bell hanging on Purple Mountain from afar. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the great modern Chinese democratic revolutionary activist, is laid to rest in this majestic and scenic place.

    In October, with clear skies and refreshing air, the smooth and clean tree-lined avenue from Nanjing city to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum is bustling with traffic, as people, filled with respect and love for the great democratic revolutionary activist Mr. Sun Yat-sen, come in groups to pay their respects. In the seven years since the liberation of Nanjing, more than 5.7 million people have come to pay homage to the marble statue of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's resting place. Among those who come to pay their respects are leaders of the Party and the government, builders of industrial bases, fishermen from the Yellow Sea coast, developers of the Karamay oil field, members of agricultural production cooperatives, scientific workers, and fraternal ethnic groups from all parts of the motherland, as well as friends from more than sixty countries. They come from the coasts of Africa, from beside the ancient pyramids, from distant Iceland, from the great Ganges River valley, from all corners of the world, to pay their respects to the great Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Among them are government delegations, cultural and artistic delegations, peace fighters, poets, and writers. Not long ago, the President of the Republic of Indonesia, Sukarno, held an Islamic religious ceremony in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's burial chamber. Leaders of the working-class parties from more than forty countries who came to our country to attend the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China have also visited the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. The Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum of today, displayed before the eyes of visitors, is even more magnificent and beautiful than before. In the past, Japanese imperialist aggressors had damaged the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. After Japan's surrender, the Kuomintang rulers, under the pretext of repairing the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, solicited donations from overseas Chinese, but after getting their hands on the $30,000 in donations, they built villas in the deep shade of the trees around the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, exclusively for the enjoyment of Kuomintang bureaucrats, while the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum remained broken and collapsing, with many buildings having peeling paint. Erdaogou, a scenic spot more than one hundred meters southeast of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, is a favorite place for visitors and tourists, but due to years of disrepair, the embankments had cracked and collapsed, the waterside pavilion was broken, and the scenery was withered. After the liberation of Nanjing, the Nanjing Municipal People's Committee allocated funds every year to repair the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. The walkways, the roof of the memorial hall, and the top of the tomb, which had been damaged due to years of disrepair, have now been completely renovated. The stone walls at the four corners of the memorial hall have been painted apple green. Many famous scenic spots and historical sites within the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Park, such as the Xingjian Pavilion and the Meihua Mountain Cloister, have also been repaired. The Nanjing Municipal People's Committee also allocated funds to repair the Erdaogou embankment and the waterside pavilion.

    In the early days of liberation, Marshal Liu Bocheng specially sent people from Yunnan to bring pine seeds to add to the scenery of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Park. When Yuan Zhongxian served as the Indian Ambassador, he also brought cedar seeds from India. These Yunnan pine and Indian cedar seeds have now grown up after careful cultivation by the park workers. In recent years, the park workers have planted more than 2.2 million broad-leaved and coniferous trees in the mausoleum park, and these trees have also grown and covered the hillsides. The farmers living near the mausoleum have also organized a forest protection committee to assist in protecting the trees of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Park. The flower nursery near the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum has also been rebuilt to cultivate seasonal flowers for the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Park. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has also established a new Sun Yat-sen Botanical Garden in the west of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to cultivate seedlings for the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Park.

    This winter and next spring, park workers will continue to afforest 2,400 mu of land in the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Park. The people of New China will continue to build and protect the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen forever.

    访南京中山陵
    新华社记者　邵琼　蒋青萍
    在南京紫金山麓，有一座宏伟的民族形式的钟形陵墓，这就是举世闻名的中山陵。
    这座陵墓有十多层楼房那样高，从陵门到达灵堂，需要攀登三百二十八级花岗石铺的台阶。灵堂和墓室是用大理石和花岗石建筑的，蓝色的琉璃屋瓦，闪闪发亮。四万多亩树木花草组成的陵园簇拥着这座壮丽的建筑物，远看就像一只闪亮的大钟挂在紫金山上。中国近代伟大的民主主义革命活动家孙中山先生，就是长眠在这气魄雄伟、景色壮丽的地方。
    十月，天高气爽，从南京城到中山陵的平坦、洁净的林荫大道上车如流水，人们怀着对伟大的民主主义革命活动家孙中山先生的敬爱，成群结队地到中山陵来谒陵。南京解放七年来，有五百七十多万人前来瞻仰了大理石雕塑的孙中山先生的灵寝。在前来谒陵的人当中，有党和政府的领导人，工业基地的建设者，黄海边的渔民，克拉玛依油田的开发者，农业生产合作社的社员，科学工作者和来自祖国各地的兄弟民族，还有六十多个国家的友人，他们从非洲海岸，古金字塔旁，遥远的冰岛，伟大的恒河流域，从世界的四面八方先后来到这里，向伟大的孙中山先生致敬。其中有政府代表团，文化艺术代表团，和平战士、诗人和作家。不久以前，印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺在孙中山先生的墓室举行了伊斯兰教的宗教仪式。前来我国参加中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的四十多个国家工人阶级政党的领导人，也先后到中山陵来谒陵。展示在谒陵者眼前的今日的中山陵，比从前更加雄伟美丽了。从前，日本帝国主义侵略者曾经破坏了中山陵。日本投降以后，国民党统治者借口修建中山陵，曾向华侨募捐，但他们把捐来的三万元美金拿到手以后，却在中山陵周围的林荫深处建筑了一幢幢专供国民党官僚们享用的别墅，而中山陵依然是破的破，坍的坍，许多建筑物油漆斑剥。中山陵东南一百多公尺风景幽美的二道沟，是谒陵者和游人们喜爱的地方，但因年久失修，堤坝裂塌，水干亭破，景物雕零。南京解放以后，南京市人民委员会每年都拨款修缮中山陵，过去因年久失修而损坏了的甬道、灵堂屋面和墓顶，现在都已经整修如新。灵堂四角的石壁漆成了苹果绿色。中山陵园范围内的行健亭、梅花山回廊等许多名胜古迹也都修好了。南京市人民委员会还拨款整修了二道沟堤坝和水榭。
    解放初期，刘伯承元帅为增添中山陵园的景色，特地派人从云南送来松树种子。袁仲贤担任印度大使的时候，也从印度送来雪松种子。这些云南松和印度雪松种子，经过园林工人的细心培植，现在都已经成长了。几年来，园林工人们在陵园里新植了阔叶树和针叶树两百二十多万株，现在这些树木也都已经成长，满布山坡。紧邻陵园居住的农民，还组织了护林委员会，协助保护中山陵园的树木。中山陵附近的花房也已经重建起来，为中山陵园培植四季鲜花。中国科学院还在中山陵西部新建立了一个中山植物园为中山陵园栽培树苗。
    今冬明春，园林工人将在中山陵园内继续造林两千四百亩。新中国的人民将以继续修建和保护中山陵，来永远纪念孙中山先生。
