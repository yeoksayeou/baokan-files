Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th. The Hong Kong "Wen Wei Po" published an editorial today stating that just as people from all walks of life are demanding that the Hong Kong British authorities severely punish the culprits and handle the aftermath properly, the Hong Kong British authorities dispatched a large number of detectives armed with guns on the 16th to search the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile Dyeing Workers' General Union and the Motorcycle Labor Children's School. Self-defense equipment used to prevent attacks by thugs, and even teacups and basket lids, were regarded as weapons and taken away. This is truly puzzling.

The editorial said: As we all know, the above two units were damaged by stone throwing thugs in the early morning of October 11th. The thugs openly stated that they wanted to beat the staff of these two units, and even attempted to set fire to the Motorcycle Labor School. Both units had telegraphed the Hong Kong police about these situations at the time. In particular, when the Motorcycle Labor School sent an emergency call to the police, the police replied that no one could be dispatched. After the riots occurred, it was completely reasonable and justifiable for workers and school parents to carry some self-defense equipment to protect their lives and school property in order to defend against further attacks by thugs; it was an act of self-defense. The editorial believes that the Hong Kong British authorities' actions are not only contrary to reason and unfair, but also offer no assistance in handling the aftermath.

The editorial said: "In fact, if the Hong Kong government wants to handle the aftermath today, the most fundamental task is to accept the demands of the broad masses of the people; to severely punish the chief culprits who created the Kowloon riots and the Tsuen Wan tragedy, and to thoroughly eliminate Kuomintang special agents."

The editorial said that only in this way can the roots of the riots be eliminated, and the lives and property of residents and the normal life of society be effectively guaranteed.

    香港“文汇报”发表社论
    抗议武装搜查学校和工会
    新华社广州18日电　香港“文汇报”今天发表社论说，正当社会人士要求香港英国当局严惩祸首和办理善后之际，香港英国当局却在16日派出大批警探荷枪搜查港九纺织染业职工总会和摩托车劳工子弟学校，把用做防止暴徒攻击的自卫器具，甚至茶杯、箩盖也视为武器，一并带走。真使人大感不解。
    社论说：如所周知，上述两单位是在10月11日凌晨受到暴徒掷石破坏的。暴徒曾公开声言要打这两单位的工作人员，甚至企图放火烧毁摩托劳校。这两个单位当时都曾把这些情况电告香港警方。特别是摩托劳校在向警方告急时，警方竟答复无人可派。在暴乱事情发生后，工人和学校家长为了防御暴徒再次袭击，携带一些自卫用具来保护自己的生命和学校财产，是完全合情合理的，是自卫行为。社论认为，香港英国当局这样做法，不仅违背情理，有欠公平，而且对于善后，毫无补助。
    社论说：“其实今天港府如要善后，最根本的工作，还是要接受广大社会人士的要求；严惩这次制造九龙大暴乱和荃湾大惨案的祸首主凶，彻底肃清国民党特务分子。”
    社论说，只有这样，才是清除暴乱祸根，保障居民生命财产和社会正常生活的最有效的善后工作。
