He has submitted a total of 970 rationalization proposals in his 27 years of work, averaging about 36 proposals per year.

This advanced worker is P. Nikitin from the "Kaprolit" factory in Orekhovo-Zuyevo. Since he put forward his first rationalization proposal in this factory in 1929, this factory has created dozens of new types of tools based on his suggestions.

    一个苏联工人在二十七年中共提出了九百七十条。
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联有一个先进工人创造了惊人的提合理化建议的记录，他在工作的二十七年中总共提出了九百七十条合理化建议，平均每年提出了三十六条左右。
    这个先进工作者是奥列霍沃—祖耶沃“卡波利特”工厂的帕·尼基京。自从他1929年在这个工厂中提出第一条合理化建议以来，这个工厂已经根据他的建议，创制了几十种新型的工具。尼基京的合理化建议还为国家节省了约两百万卢布的资金。
