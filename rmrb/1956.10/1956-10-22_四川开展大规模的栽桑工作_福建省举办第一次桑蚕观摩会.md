Xinhua News Agency report: Sichuan Province is carrying out large-scale mulberry planting. More than a dozen counties in the Jiangjin, Leshan and other regions, which started planting mulberry seedlings in early October, have planted more than 20 million mulberry seedlings so far. According to local plans, from October to December this year, the province will plant more than 360 million mulberry seedlings, which is about two and a half times more than the number of mulberry trees planted last year; the area for planting mulberry trees has also increased from more than 60 counties last year to more than 120 counties.

The relevant person in charge of the Sichuan Provincial Sericulture Bureau said: Such a large-scale mulberry planting is the first time in Sichuan Province. He said that according to surveys, the temperature, soil and other conditions in most parts of Sichuan Province are suitable for planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms. This year, the places where mulberry seedlings are planted generally use barren land, river banks, pond embankments, roadsides, and open spaces around houses, which will not compete with grain and cotton crops for land. Because advanced technologies such as strip sowing and wide-row close planting were adopted in various places during the sowing and seedling cultivation period this year, the mulberry seedlings are growing vigorously.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, October 18th: Fujian Province held its first sericulture observation meeting in early October. Sixty farmer representatives and cadres from some counties and cities observed the silkworm breeding experience of the Third Agricultural Cooperative of Ganzhe Town, Minhou County.

This cooperative has reclaimed more than 200 mu of mulberry gardens on the sandy lands along the Minjiang River that are not suitable for planting food crops. Because of the mild climate, the silkworm breeding period starts from Qingming and lasts until the beginning of winter frost, and silkworm cocoons can be harvested seven times. The silkworms currently being raised for the sixth time are already on the cocoon frames. According to the silkworm breeder, it is estimated that the income from seven silkworm breeding seasons throughout the year can reach more than 24,000 yuan.

The representatives also went to the Fujian Provincial Sericulture Experimental Station outside the North Gate of Fuzhou City to learn about the experience of reclaiming mulberry gardens on barren hillsides.

Fujian Province has good natural conditions and is suitable for planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms everywhere. However, this sideline production was very underdeveloped in the past. Now the relevant departments plan to help farmers gradually develop this sideline production.

    四川开展大规模的栽桑工作
    福建省举办第一次桑蚕观摩会
    据新华社讯　四川省农村正在开展大规模的栽桑工作。从10月上旬就已动手栽植的江津、乐山等专区的十多个县，目前已栽植桑苗两千多万株。根据各地的计划，从今年10月到12月，全省将要栽种桑苗三亿六千多万株，这个数字约比去年栽桑株数增加二倍半；栽桑的地区，也由去年的六十多个县，增加到一百二十多个县。
    四川省蚕桑管理局的有关负责人说：这样大规模的栽桑，在四川省还是第一次。他说，根据调查，四川省大部分地区的气温、土壤等条件都适于栽桑养蚕。今年栽种桑苗的地方，一般都是利用荒坪、河坝、塘埂、路边、屋前屋后等空地，不会与粮棉作物争地。由于今年各地在播种育苗时期，采用了条播、宽行密株等先进技术，桑苗生长茁壮。
    新华社福州18日电　福建省在10月上旬举办了第一次桑蚕观摩会。来自一部分县市的六十位农民代表和干部，观摩了闽侯县甘蔗镇第三农业社的养蚕经验。
    这个社在闽江沿岸不宜种植粮食作物的沙洲上开辟出二百多亩桑园。因为气候温和，养蚕期从清明开始一直到立冬下霜，可以收蚕茧七次。目前第六次养的蚕已上簇。据蚕长说，预计全年七次养蚕收入可达二万四千多元。
    代表们还到福州市北门外的福建省桑蚕试验站学习在贫瘠的荒山坡上开辟桑园的经验。
    福建省自然条件良好，到处适宜栽桑养蚕。但过去这项副业生产很不发达。现在有关部门计划帮助农民逐步发展这项副业生产。
