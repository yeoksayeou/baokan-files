Xinhua News Agency, 18th - Premier Zhou Enlai received Mr. Humphrey Trevelyan, the British Chargé d'Affaires, on October 16th. Mr. Trevelyan conveyed the British government's reply regarding the Kowloon riots. In this reply, the British government stated that it shared the Chinese government's regret over the riots, but could not accept the Chinese government's serious accusation that the British authorities in Hong Kong had failed to take effective measures to stop the riots. He said that the British authorities in Hong Kong had done their best to protect its own and foreign interests from the very beginning; the causes of the riots are under investigation, and the Hong Kong authorities will severely punish those responsible for violating public order.

Premier Zhou Enlai expressed his dissatisfaction with the British government's reply, which exonerated the British authorities in Hong Kong. Premier Zhou pointed out that the British authorities in Hong Kong failed to take effective measures to stop the riots organized and instigated by Kuomintang secret agents and failed to effectively protect the lives and property of Chinese residents and Chinese government-affiliated organizations and enterprises in Hong Kong and Kowloon, resulting in significant losses to the lives and property of peaceful Chinese residents. The British authorities in Hong Kong bear an undeniable responsibility for this. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out that the British authorities in Hong Kong had adopted a policy of connivance and tolerance towards the Kuomintang secret agents who created the riots, never daring to utter a single word of condemnation, but absurdly described the riots as a conflict between Chinese of the left and right or between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang. Premier Zhou expressed extreme indignation at this and lodged a protest. Premier Zhou Enlai demanded that the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong promptly respond to the Chinese government's protest and demands with facts, and reiterated that the Chinese government reserves the right to make further demands in the future.

    香港当局对国民党特务采取包庇纵容态度
    周总理接见英代办提出抗议
    对英国政府为香港当局开脱责任的答复表示不能满意
    新华社18日讯　周恩来总理在10月16日接见了英国代办欧念儒先生。欧念儒代办转达了英国政府关于九龙暴乱事件的答复。在这答复中，英国政府表示它对这次暴乱和中国政府同样感到遗憾，但对于中国政府提出的香港英国当局未能采取有效措施制止暴乱的严正指责却认为不能接受。他说香港英国当局从一开始就尽力保护它本身的和外国的利益；关于暴乱事件的起因正在调查中，香港当局将严惩应对违反治安负责的人。
    周恩来总理对英国政府这个为香港英国当局开脱责任的答复表示不能满意。周总理指出香港英国当局未能采取有效措施制止国民党特务分子所组织和策动的暴乱和未能切实保护港九中国居民和中国政府所属机关和企业，致使中国和平居民的生命财产遭受重大损失，香港英国当局对此负有不容推卸的责任。周恩来总理指出香港英国当局对制造此次暴乱的国民党特务分子，采取了包庇和纵容的态度，始终不敢加以只字的谴责，却荒谬地把暴乱说成左右两派中国人之间或共产党和国民党之间的冲突。对此，周总理表示极大的愤慨并且提出抗议。周恩来总理要求英国政府和香港英国当局尽速用事实对中国政府的抗议和要求作出答复，并且再次声明，中国政府保留在以后提出要求的权利。
