　　Four. Folk Literature and Literary Literature

　　Lu Xun believed that literary literature was nurtured by folk literature: "Occasionally, a little (referring to works of folk literature) is seen by literati, who are often surprised and absorb it into their own works as new nourishment. When old literature declines, it undergoes a new change by absorbing folk literature... this example is commonly seen in literary history." ("Essays Written Before Shutting the Gate") "Songs, poems, lyrics, and operas, I think were originally folk creations. Literati take them as their own, making them more and more difficult to understand, turning them into stiff stones, and then they take another one, slowly strangling it again." ("Lu Xun Letters," February 20, 1934, seventeenth letter to Yao Ke)

　　Lu Xun gave the following examples:

　　1. "That is, many of the things in the 'Airs of the States' in the Book of Songs are works by illiterate anonymous people. Because they were relatively excellent, they were passed down by word of mouth. The royal officials extracted them as records for administrative reference, and who knows how many others were eliminated." ("Essays Written Before Shutting the Gate")

　　2. "For example, take the Songs of Chu. 'Li Sao' has dialect, but it is not difficult to understand. When it comes to Yang Xiong, he deliberately makes it 'ancient and obscure,' making it incomprehensible, which is not far from running out of breath." ("Lu Xun Letters," same letter as above)

　　3. "The 'Midnight Songs' and 'Reading Tune Songs' from the Eastern Jin to the Qi and Chen dynasties... were originally creations by anonymous people, which were preserved after being collected and embellished by literati. This embellishment, while preserving and disseminating them, unfortunately, certainly lost many of their original features." "Anonymous literature such as 'Midnight Songs' can give old literature a new strength." ("Essays Written Before Shutting the Gate")

　　4. "The 'Bamboo Branch Songs' and 'Willow Branch Songs' of the Tang Dynasty were originally creations by anonymous people." ("Essays Written Before Shutting the Gate") "Scholars and officials often want to seize things from the folk, turning 'Bamboo Branch Songs' into classical Chinese, and taking 'modest young ladies' as concubines, but once they touch them, these things perish with them." ("Marginal Literature": "A Brief Discussion of Mei Lanfang and Others")

　　5. "The beginnings of ci and opera were also literary and easy to understand, not difficult, but later on, they became really difficult to read." ("Lu Xun Letters," same letter as above)

　　6. "The Water Margin stories are also legends that have been circulating since the Southern Song Dynasty. Song Jiang also existed in reality... However, when Song Jiang and others gathered at Liangshanbo, their power was very strong. The History of the Song Dynasty (353) also says, 'They plundered ten counties, and the government army dared not confront them.' Therefore, there were strange stories and rumors, born in the folk, repeatedly changing and evolving into stories, and then embellished by interested people, and literary works came out... Yuan Dynasty zaju also repeatedly took Water Margin stories as materials. Song Jiang, Yan Qing, and Li Kui are especially frequently seen. Their personalities often differ from those in the current Water Margin, but there is no difference in the benevolent, righteous, kind, and generous portrayal of Song Jiang. Chen Tai (from Chaling, a jinshi in the Yuan Dynasty's Yanyou period) recorded what he heard from the boatmen, saying, 'Song was brave and unrestrained' (Collected Works of Suo An, Supplement, Preface to Jiangnan Tune), which is the opposite of other books. It is likely that there were many of these stories circulating among the people at that time." ("A Brief History of Chinese Fiction": "History-telling Stories Passed Down from the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, Part 2")

　　From Lu Xun's words above, we can believe that whether it is the Book of Songs, Songs of Chu, poetry of the Six Dynasties, Tang poetry, Song lyrics, Yuan opera, or even chaptered novels, they all started from folk literature; and literary literature was nurtured by folk literature before it grew strong. Once literary literature is far away from folk literature, like Antaeus in Greek mythology leaving the ground, it gradually becomes weak and powerless. We can say that without folk literature, there would be no literary literature! How can we not value this driving force of literary literature!

    鲁迅先生与民间文学
    赵景深
    四　民间文学和文人文学
    鲁迅先生认为文人文学是受民间文学哺养的：“偶有一点（按指民间文学作品）为文人所见，往往倒吃惊，吸入自己的作品中，作为新的养料。旧文学衰颓时，因为摄取民间文学……而起一个新变，这例子是常见于文学史上的。”（“门 外文谈”）“歌、诗、词、曲，我以为原是民间物，文人取为己有，越做越难懂，弄得变成僵石，他们就又去取一样，又来慢慢的绞死它。”（“鲁迅书简”1934年2月20日致姚克第十七信）
    鲁迅曾举过如下的一些例子：
    1、“就是诗经的国风里的东西，好许多也是不识字的无名氏作品，因为比较的优秀，大家口口相传的。王官们检出它可作行政上参考的记录了下来，此外消灭的正不知有多少。”（“门外文谈”）
    2、“譬如楚辞罢，离骚虽有方言，倒不难懂，到了扬雄，就特地‘古奥’，令人莫明其妙，这就离断气不远矣。”（“鲁迅书简”同上信）
    3、“东晋到齐、陈的子夜歌和读曲歌之类，……原都是无名氏的创作，经文人的采录和润色之后，留传下来的。这一润色，留传固然流传了，但可惜的是一定失去了许多本来面目”。“无名氏文学如子夜歌之流，会给旧文学一种新力量。”（“门外文谈”）
    4、“唐朝的竹枝词和柳枝词之类，原都是无名氏的创作。”（“门外文谈”）“士大夫是常要夺取民间的东西的，将竹枝词改成文言，将‘小家碧玉’作为姨太太，但一沾着他们的手，这东西也就跟着他们灭亡。”（“花边文学”：“略论梅兰芳及其他上”）
    5、“词、曲之始，也都文从字顺，并不艰难，到后来，可就实在难读了。”（“鲁迅书简”同上信）
    6、“水浒故事亦为南宋来流行之传说，宋江亦实有其人……然以宋江等啸聚梁山滦时，其势实甚盛，宋史（三百五十三）亦云‘转略十郡，官军莫敢撄其锋’。于是自有奇闻异说，生于民间，辗转繁变，以成故事，复经好事者掇拾粉饰，而文籍以出。……元人杂剧亦屡取水浒故事为资材，宋江、燕青、李逵尤数见，性格每与在今本水浒传中者差违，但于宋江之仁义长厚无异词，而陈泰（茶陵人，元延祐乙卯进士）记所闻于篙师者，则云‘宋之为人勇悍狂侠’（所安遗集补遗江南曲序）与他书又正反。意者此种故事，当时载在人口者必甚多。”（“中国小说史略”：“元明传来之讲史下”）
    从以上鲁迅先生的话，我们可以相信，无论诗经、楚辞、六朝诗歌、唐诗、宋词、元曲，甚至章回小说，都是从民间文学开始的；而文人文学却受了民间文学的哺养，方才壮大起来。一旦文人文学远离了民间文学，好像希腊神话中安泰乌斯离开了地面，也就逐渐软弱无力起来。我们可以说，没有民间文学，就没有文人文学！我们又怎能不重视这文人文学的原动力呢！
