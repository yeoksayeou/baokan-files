Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 30th. The Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Organs, with the assistance of local garrison troops and the masses, completely cracked the "Kuocang Mountain Action Team" special agent organization dispatched by Taiwan in late July.

The captured special agents Zhou Qingbao, Li Yuqin, Chen Yiping, Lin Bangzhe, Lin Yishou, and Pan Zhouhong confessed that when they left Matsu in early July, their first step after landing was to establish a foothold on Xiaomenshan, a remote island in Dongtou County, Zhejiang, obtain a transportation boat to contact Matsu Island, which was occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek army, and then sneak into the mainland to set up a radio station in the Kuocang Mountains area of Zhejiang.

Before sneaking into the mainland, this group of special agents received special agent training in the "Intelligence Bureau" of the Taiwan Chiang gang. The training included intelligence gathering, communication and liaison, demolition, tracking, guerrilla warfare, infiltration, and subversion. Last November, when they left Taipei for Matsu, the Third Department of the Chiang gang's Intelligence Bureau and the special agent leader Mao Renfeng (who died on October 14th) repeatedly checked their preparations and action plans. Mao Renfeng ordered the Intelligence Bureau personnel to prepare a Five-Star Red Flag and daily necessities produced in Zhejiang, Shanghai, and other places for them, and instructed Zhou Qingbao and others to pay attention to safety after landing. If actions were difficult, they should disperse and hide to seek long-term infiltration. A special agent from the Chiang gang's Intelligence Bureau also explained some new customs and habits on the mainland to them, such as not paying tips when eating in restaurants, not bargaining when buying things, and explained terms such as the mass line and subjectivism.

Special agents Zhou Qingbao, Chen Yiping, Li Yuqin, Lin Bangzhe, and others were bandits in the southeast coastal area of Zhejiang in the early days of Zhejiang's liberation. Later, they were reorganized by the Chiang gang into the "Second Department Special Task Force Thirty-eighth Group of the Dachen Defense Headquarters," specializing in intelligence gathering activities. In the summer of 1955, the Taiwan Chiang gang's Intelligence Bureau recruited them again.

Currently, the investigation work of the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Organs has ended, and these special agents have been transferred to the procuratorial organs for review and prosecution to the People's Court.

### 浙江省公安机关在当地驻军和群众协助下  捕获一批台湾派遣的特务分子

    浙江省公安机关在当地驻军和群众协助下
    捕获一批台湾派遣的特务分子
    新华社杭州30日电　浙江省公安机关在当地驻军和群众协助下，在7月下旬全部破获了台湾派遣的“括苍山行动队”特务组织。
    被捕获的特务周庆宝、李玉琴、陈一平、林邦者、林益寿和潘舟弘供认：他们在7月初离开马祖时，计划登陆后的第一步行动，是在浙江沿海洞头县的一个孤僻小岛——小门山上建立一个立足点，搞一条交通船，和蒋军盘据的马祖岛联系，然后潜入大陆在浙江括苍山区架设电台。
    在潜入大陆以前，这一批特务分子曾在台湾蒋帮的“情报局”里受了专门的特务训练。训练的内容有搜集情报、通讯联络、爆破、跟踪、游击、潜伏和策反等。去年11月，当他们离开台北去马祖前，蒋帮的情报局第三处和特务头子毛人凤（这个特务头子已在10月14日死了）曾几次检查他们的准备工作和行动计划。毛人凤命令情报局的人员为他们准备一面五星红旗和浙江、上海等地生产的日用品，并指示周庆宝等在登陆以后要注意安全，如行动困难，即分散隐蔽，以求能够长期潜伏下来。蒋帮情报局的一个特务又向他们讲解了大陆上的一些新的风俗习惯，如到饭店吃饭不付小账、买东西不还价以及讲解群众路线、主观主义等名词术语。
    特务周庆宝、陈一平、李玉琴、林邦者等在浙江解放初期就在浙江东南沿海当土匪，以后被蒋帮改编为“大陈防守部二处特勤大队第三十八组”，专门从事搜集情报的活动。1955年夏天，台湾蒋帮情报局又把他们网罗了去。
    现在，浙江省公安机关的侦讯工作已经结束，并把这批特务移送给检察机关审查和向人民法院提起公诉。
