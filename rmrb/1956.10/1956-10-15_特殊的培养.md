    Special Upbringing
    Ye Zhiqiu
    Not long ago, the Shanghai Liberation Daily published a social news story exposing a case of a fifteen-year-old boy committing murder and robbery. On the same day, the newspaper also published a commentary, citing a story about a notorious bandit in the past who, before his execution, bit off his mother's nipple out of hatred for her failure to educate him. Both the bandit in the story and the fifteen-year-old boy who committed murder and robbery became criminals due to their parents' indulgence and lack of discipline. Although this was not what the parents had intended, the heavy responsibility cannot be compensated for by "if only I had known."
    Of course, this should be an isolated phenomenon, but this "phenomenon" brings us a serious warning. We often have a very naive idea, thinking that everything in society has been completely renewed after liberation, as if the "remnants" of the old society have been completely eliminated all at once. Some people think that this is just an isolated phenomenon, and there is nothing to be alarmed about. However, I believe that this "isolated phenomenon" is worth our vigilance. The social atmosphere and social transformation are only one aspect, while the education and cultivation of children by parents is a very important other aspect.
    It seems that all parents in the world love their children and have the desire to "hope their children become dragons," but the methods adopted are different. Some people emphasize social education, especially believing that our society has been completely renewed, and it seems that educating children is no longer their own responsibility. Others isolate their children from the general society and give them a "special upbringing." Of course, the former approach is due to thinking too naively and abandoning the responsibility of being a parent. The latter approach puts children in a privileged position from an early age. It seems that parents are thinking very carefully for their children, but the consequences of this special upbringing are very terrible. For example, we have seen that some "individual" children in nurseries grow a sense of pride and complacency in their young minds because their father is a × director and they are picked up and dropped off by car. This is very terrible. Some primary and secondary schools that were exclusively for the children of senior cadres have been converted into ordinary schools, allowing the children of senior cadres to study with the children of ordinary people. This is very correct. However, some have not been changed. This "special upbringing" is not good for children, but it cultivates a sense of superiority in the minds of those innocent children, which will bring some unnecessary disadvantages. If you care about the education of your children, let them be trained in a normal state and give them the ability to create their own world.

    特殊的培养
    叶知秋
    不久前上海解放日报上发表了一条社会新闻，揭露了一件十五岁少年杀人越货的案件；同天报纸上还发表了评论，并引了一段故事说，过去曾有一个江洋大盗犯了案，临刑时因恨他母亲没有给他教育，把他母亲的奶头咬掉了。故事中的强盗和这个十五岁杀人越货的少年，都曾由于家长的宠爱，缺乏管教，终于成为盗匪；虽非做父母的始料所及，但是这个沉重的责任就不是“悔不当初”所能补偿的了。
    当然，这应该是个别现象，但是这个“现象”却给我们带来了一个严重的警告。我们往往有着一种很天真的想法，以为解放后社会上一切都已焕然一新，好像那些旧社会的“残余”一下子都已经清除得一干二净了。有的人认为这不过是个别现象，有什么值得大惊小怪？但是我以为这个“个别现象”却很值得我们警惕，社会的风气和社会的改造只是一面，做父母的对孩子的教育和培养却是很重要的另一面。
    天下父母对孩子的宠爱，“望子成龙”的心情似乎都是一样的，但所采方法不同。有一种人是强调社会教育，特别是认为我们的社会已彻底变新，教育孩子的事似乎已经不是自己的责任了。另外一种是把自己的子弟和一般社会隔绝起来，给予一种“特殊的培养”。当然，前一种的做法是由于想得太天真，而把做父母的责任放弃了。后一种的做法，是从小就把孩子放在一种养尊处优的地位上，看来似乎是做父母的为孩子们想得很周到，但是这种特殊培养的后果是很可怕的。比如我们曾经看到有的托儿所中的“个别”的孩子因为爸爸是×长，有汽车接送，在弱小的心灵中滋长着一种骄傲自满的优越感，这是很可怕的。有一些专为高级干部的子弟设立的小学、中学已经改为普通学校，让高级干部的子弟和一般人的子弟们一起学习，这是很对的。可是有一些还没有改。这种“特殊的培养”对孩子们是没有什么好处的，倒是因而在那些天真无邪的孩子们的心灵中培养着“高人一等”的优越感，将会带来一些本不应有的坏处。如果关心孩子们的教养，还是让他们在正常的状态中受到锻炼，让他们有能力创造自己的天地。
