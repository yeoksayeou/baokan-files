Check and Overcome Subjectivism and Commandism in Rural Work
Li Jiping, Secretary of the CPC Xingtai Prefectural Committee

    The realization of complete socialist agricultural collectivization has resolved some fundamental contradictions in rural areas and opened up broad avenues for the massive development of agricultural production. In Xingtai area, the amount of fertilizer applied to the land this year has increased more than ninefold compared to last year. The wells, reservoirs, and canals built this year, if fully utilized, can expand irrigated land by 1.3 million mu. Flood and waterlogging prevention began in the plains in February, initially reversing the passive situation of flood control in previous years. Soil and water conservation has been carried out in mountainous areas, and a comprehensive method of overall coordination and key gully management has been adopted. According to the understanding of 625 gullies comprehensively managed by the end of June, after three rainfalls of 195 mm, it has basically achieved "no soil down the mountains, no water out of the gullies." It is estimated that more than 1,000 gullies will be managed this year, which can slow down floods and control runoff by more than 156 million cubic meters, reducing the flow by one-tenth, ensuring that disasters in the plains and mountainous areas are reduced year by year, and increasing production. In order to adapt to the needs of the new collective production situation, a large number of agricultural and forestry technicians have also been trained, technical reforms in agricultural production have been carried out, advanced production experiences have been widely promoted, the growth patterns of different crops have been summarized, and the ability to resist disasters has been greatly increased. This year's wheat harvest was unprecedentedly abundant. The unit yield of more than 3.5 million mu of wheat in the whole area increased by more than 29% compared to last year, and the total output increased by 32%. Majiang in Ningjin, Shiling Village in Shahe, and Junying in Xingtai have all created new records of more than 1,000 jin of wheat per mu.
    In the rural areas where advanced cooperatives have been realized, not only has a new atmosphere emerged in agricultural production, but also new developments have taken place in cultural construction and economic life. According to statistics from Xingtai Department Store, sales in the first half of this year increased by 34.8% compared to the same period last year; the sales of means of production increased even faster, with a total sales value of 5,246,000 yuan in the first quarter of this year, more than double that of the same period last year. The number of farmers participating in cultural learning has increased sevenfold compared to last year; the number of rural clubs has increased threefold compared to last year.
    We must soberly analyze the changes and characteristics of rural areas after the victory of the agricultural collectivization movement. We must not only see the favorable and good aspects, but also see the difficult and bad aspects, and we must see the new contradictions that have arisen under the new situation and correctly resolve these contradictions. Currently, there are contradictions between the collective and the individual in rural areas, contradictions between cooperatives and the state, contradictions between the development of production and the lack of technical talent, contradictions between large-scale capital construction (future interests) and current production activities (current interests), contradictions between positive and negative factors among the masses, and so on. It is precisely because of the lack of a correct understanding of these contradictions, or some aspect of these contradictions, that many one-sided subjectivist ideas and bureaucratic work styles that are divorced from the masses have occurred.
    Because we only saw the production enthusiasm of the masses and the favorable conditions for production in some areas after advanced collectivization, and lacked keen observation and detailed analysis of the development and changes of new things, there was a period of impatience and rash advance in our work. We blindly "compared with the advanced" in other regions without considering the actual conditions; we did not consult with the masses, and a few party cadres took over the formulation of plans. Therefore, many work tasks were required to be too high and the time was too urgent. In Xingtai area, the grain yield per mu in 1955 was 150 jin; the prefectural committee once planned to increase it to 260 jin in 1956; the cotton yield per mu in 1955 was 39 jin (lint), and it was required to reach 60 jin in 1956. Under the influence of this thinking of the prefectural committee, the plans of some counties and cooperatives were also set too high. According to the inspection of 2,494 cooperatives in 14 counties, the production plans of 1,385 cooperatives were set too high. Qinghe, Xingtai, Neiqiu and other counties blindly "caught up with the advanced" and generally carried out the "high-yield thousand-jin cooperative movement," once demanding that the grain and cotton production increase targets to be achieved in twelve years in the National Agricultural Development Program be exceeded in one year. Many farmers in Qinghe County reflected that the announced planned output was "daydreaming." Therefore, after the output plan was formulated, it could not be contracted to the teams, which affected the production enthusiasm of the masses. After instructions from the Central Committee, we began to correct it in February this year, and although the plan has gradually approached reality; however, today, some places still have too high targets. Hebei Province stipulated that the task of eliminating illiteracy should be completed in six years, but Xingtai County stipulated that it should be completed in four years, and the township stipulated that it should be completed in three years. This gradual advancement caused the error of only paying attention to quantity and not to effect, and made the farmers exhausted. During the busy farming season, farmers were forced not to rest at noon and not to sleep at twelve o'clock at night; some teachers and students in the cooperatives were dozing off in the classroom.
    In terms of accepting science and technology, there is dogmatic thinking, and some measures do not conform to the principles of adapting to the time and adapting to local conditions. For example, when promoting early sowing in the spring, fearing that the seedlings would come out early and be frozen to death, the method of "deep sowing" was implemented. As a result, some cooperatives sowed the seeds but did not produce seedlings, so they had to rework and resow; as a result, early sowing became late sowing, and seeds were wasted. The promotion of close planting also did not distinguish between dry land and paddy fields and different soil conditions, and cotton was planted at 6,000 plants per mu across the board. This also fueled the coercive command style of lower-level cadres.
    In terms of water conservancy construction, the provincial leadership organs rigidly assigned tasks and did not allow changes, so we rigidly distributed the figures to lower levels. In areas that are not suitable for well-drilling or lack technical personnel, it has caused serious economic losses to the masses. For example, 32 of the 44 cylinder wells drilled in Pingxiang County were broken; in Sanlizhuang, Nangong, not a single well was drilled, but the state lost more than 1,000 yuan, and the masses wasted more than 4,000 workdays; in Julu, a well was drilled for 52 zhang, which took several months, and good water has not yet been seen.
    Many agricultural cooperatives spent too much labor on capital construction in the first half of the year, generally accounting for about 20%. Dongyangquan Agricultural Cooperative in Lincheng used a total of 19,000 workdays before the wheat harvest this year, of which 13,000 were used for capital construction. Because there was a lot of work in the cooperative, many members' individual sideline production was not carried out well. Many people said: "Advanced cooperatives are good, but individual spending is too tight-fisted, and the work is too tiring."
    We have also made one-sided mistakes in the relationship between individual interests and collective interests. During this period, the main bias was to one-sidedly emphasize collective interests and neglect the individual interests of the members. When formulating production plans, the planning for sideline production emphasized the collective and relaxed the individual. Many cooperatives restricted individual sideline production and criticized members who engaged in sideline production for having "bourgeois ideas." Cooperative cadres arbitrarily formulated systems and forced members to comply, forming a situation where a few people acted arbitrarily.
    We must universally, deeply, resolutely, and conscientiously check the errors of subjectivism and commandism that have arisen in our work, educate party members and cadres, make everyone aware of the harm that subjectivism and commandism cause to the revolutionary cause, conscientiously check and expose their own errors, resolutely correct errors, and promote the party's correct ideology and work style throughout the party and among revolutionary cadres.
    The way to overcome subjectivism is to "conduct specific analysis of objective and concrete things." We must strengthen investigation and research work, and not only see the phenomena of objective things, but also recognize their essence; not only recognize their parts, but also see their whole. We must not only base ourselves on the needs of the country and the people, but also act according to the possibilities of objective conditions, adapting to the time and adapting to local conditions. Only in this way can we truly and thoroughly overcome right-leaning conservative thinking in our work. Otherwise, subjectivism, blindly bumping around, hurting our heads, and right-leaning conservative thinking will still raise its head.
    In order to overcome the commandist style of work, it is also necessary to strengthen the education of cadres on the mass viewpoint and implement the policy of democratic cooperative management. It is necessary to effectively establish a democratic management system within the cooperative, convene members' representative meetings regularly in accordance with the cooperative charter, and submit major issues in the cooperative to the members' congress for democratic discussion. Commandism and subjectivism are inseparable. By overcoming commandism and following the mass line, subjectivism can be reduced; by overcoming subjectivism and seeking truth from facts, commandism can also be reduced.

    检查和克服农村工作中的主观主义和命令主义
    中共邢台地委书记  李吉平
    完全社会主义的农业合作化的实现，解决了农村中的一些根本矛盾，给大量发展农业生产开辟了广阔的道路。从邢台地区来看，今年土地施肥量比去年提高了九倍多。今年建成的水井、水库、渠道全部利用起来可以扩大水浇地一百三十万亩。2月份在平原就开始了防洪防涝，初步扭转了历年防汛被动的局面。山区开展了水土保持，并采取了全面配合重点山沟综合治理的方法，仅据6月底综合治理的六百二十五条山沟了解，从三次降雨量在一百九十五公厘的情况下的考验，基本上实现了“土不下山，水不出川”。估计今年治理一千多道山沟，可以缓洪和控制径流水量一亿五千六百多万立方，减少流量十分之一，可以保证平原和山区逐年减少灾害，增加产量。为了适应新的集体生产情况的需要，还大批训练了农业、林业技术人员，进行了农业生产的技术改革工作，普遍推广了先进生产经验，总结了不同农作物的生长规律，大大增加了抗灾能力。今年的小麦得到空前的丰收，全区三百五十多万亩小麦，单位产量比去年提高了29％多，总产量提高了32％；宁晋马坊、沙河石岭村、邢台军营，都创造了亩产小麦千斤以上的新纪录。
    在实现了高级合作化的农村，不仅在农业生产上出现了新气象，在文化建设和经济生活上也有新发展。据邢台百货公司统计，今年上半年比去年同期售货量增加34.8％；生产资料的销售增长更快，今年一季度销售总值五百二十四万六千元，比去年同期增长了一倍多。参加文化学习的农民比去年增加了七倍；农村俱乐部比去年增加了三倍。
    我们要清醒地分析农业合作化运动胜利以后农村的变化和特点。不仅要看到有利的和好的一面，而且也要看困难的和不好的一面，要看到在新的情况下发生的新的矛盾，并且要正确地解决这些矛盾。从当前看，农村中存在着集体和个人的矛盾，合作社和国家的矛盾，发展生产和技术人材缺乏的矛盾，大的基本建设（将来利益）与当前生产活动（当前利益）的矛盾，群众中间的积极因素和消极因素的矛盾，等等。正是由于对这些矛盾，或者这些矛盾中的某一方面缺乏正确的认识，才发生了不少片面性的主观主义思想，脱离群众的官僚主义作风。
    由于我们只看到了高级合作化后的群众生产热情和某些部分的生产有利条件，对新事物的发展变化缺乏锐敏的观察和细致的分析，在工作中曾一度发生了急躁冒进情绪，不根据实际条件，盲目地同别的地区“比先进”；不同群众商量研究，少数党员干部包办制定计划。因此，不少工作任务要求偏高，时间过急。邢台地区粮食产量1955年每亩是一百五十斤；地委一度计划1956年增到二百六十斤；棉花产量1955年每亩是三十九斤（皮棉），1956年就要求达到六十斤。在地委的这种思想影响下，有些县和合作社的计划也就订得偏高了。据十四个县二千四百九十四个社检查，生产计划订得偏高的就有一千三百八十五个社。清河、邢台、内丘等县盲目地“赶先进”，一般化地开展“高额丰产千斤社运动”，曾经要求一年中超过全国农业发展纲要中要在十二年达到的粮棉增产指标。清河县许多农民反映宣布的计划产量是“说梦话”。因此，产量计划订了以后包不到队，影响了群众的生产积极性。经中央指示，我们自今年2月开始纠正以后，计划虽然逐步接近实际了；可是，今天看来，有的地方指标还是偏高的。扫除文盲的任务，河北省规定六年完成，到邢台县规定为四年完成，到乡规定为三年完成。这样逐级提前，就造成了只顾数量不看效果的错误，而且使农民疲惫不堪。到了农忙季节还强制农民中午不休息，夜十二点不睡觉；有的社教员和学生都在课堂上打起瞌睡来。　　在接受科学技术方面，有教条主义思想，有些措施不合乎因时制宜、因地制宜的原则。如在春天推广早播的时候，怕苗出的早天寒冻死，推行了“深播”的办法，结果，有些社播了种没有出苗，只好返工再播；结果，早播变成了晚播，还浪费了种子。推广密植也没有区别旱地水地和不同的土质条件，棉花一律每亩六千棵。这也助长了下层干部的强迫命令作风。　　在水利建设方面，省级领导机关硬性地分配了任务，不让变动，我们也就硬性地逐级把数字分配下去。在不适宜打井或缺乏技术人员的地区，给群众造成了严重的经济损失。如平乡县打缸管井四十四个就坏了三十二个；南宫三里庄一眼井没打成，国家却损失了一千多元，群众浪费了四千多个工；巨鹿一眼井打了五十二丈，费时数月，至今还没见到好水。
    不少农业社上半年基本建设用工过多，一般约占20％左右。临城东阳泉农业社今年麦收前共用了一万九千个工，其中用在基本建设方面的就有一万三千个。因为社内用工多，所以不少社员的个人副业生产没有开展好。不少人说：“高级社好是好，就是个人花钱太死巴，干活累的受不了。”
    在个人利益和集体利益的关系上，我们也犯了片面性的错误。在这一个时期，主要的偏向是片面地强调了集体利益，忽视了社员个人利益。在制定生产规划的时候，对副业生产的规划强调了集体的，放松了个人的。有不少社限制个人经营副业生产，批评搞副业的社员“有资产阶级思想”。社干部任意规定制度，强制社员遵守，形成少数人独断专行。
    我们要普遍深入地坚决认真地检查在工作中产生的主观主义、命令主义的错误，教育党员和干部，使大家认识主观主义、命令主义给予革命事业的危害，认真检查揭发自己的错误，坚决纠正错误，在全党和革命干部当中推广党的正确的思想作风。
    克服主观主义的办法，就是“对客观具体事物进行具体分析”。我们必须加强调查研究工作，对客观事物不仅要看到它的现象，而且要认识它的本质；不但要认识它的局部，而且要看到它的整体。既要根据国家和人民的需要，也要按照客观条件的可能，因时因地制宜地办事。也只有如此，才能真正彻底克服在工作中的右倾保守思想。不然，主观主义，盲目乱碰，碰痛了头，右倾保守思想是还会抬头的。
    为了克服命令主义作风，还必须对干部加强群众观点教育，贯彻执行民主办社的方针。要切实建立社内民主管理制度，按照社章定期召开社员代表大会，把社内重大问题都交给社员大会民主讨论。命令主义和主观主义是不可分的。克服了命令主义，办事走群众路线，主观主义就可以减少了；克服了主观主义，办事实事求是，命令主义也就可以减少了。
