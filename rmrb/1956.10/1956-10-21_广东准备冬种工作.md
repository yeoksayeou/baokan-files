Guangdong Prepares for Winter Planting
    (By our newspaper) Guangdong Province, known as "Evergreen in all seasons, with no snow in three winter months", has begun winter planting preparations, closely following the autumn harvest, to launch a large-scale winter production campaign. As early as the beginning of August, the provincial agricultural and grain departments had already purchased and supplied over 24 million catties of seeds for winter planting, including broad beans, peas, potatoes, and rapeseed, from Sichuan, Hunan, Heilongjiang and other provinces. The Zhanjiang and Shantou special districts, which have a traditional habit of winter planting, have mobilized farmers to inspect and sun-dry seeds, and are adopting mutual assistance methods to solve the difficulties of seed shortages. Many agricultural cooperatives in Chaoan, Wuhua, and Yingde counties have begun to formulate winter planting plans and arrange winter planting labor.
    This year, the province's winter planting area will be expanded by five million mu compared to last year. In order to learn from the past lessons of some areas that suffered disasters and losses due to planting single crops regardless of natural conditions, it has been decided this year to vigorously implement the policy of adapting to local conditions and cultivate a variety of crops such as sweet potatoes, beans, and wheat.

    广东准备冬种工作
    本报讯　“三冬无雪，四季常青”的广东省，为了紧接在秋收之后，开展一个规模巨大的冬季生产运动，已开始了冬种准备工作。早在8月初，省农业、粮食部门已向四川、湖南、黑龙江等省调购供应冬种的蚕豆、豌豆、马铃薯、油菜等种子两千四百多万斤。向来有冬种习惯的湛江、汕头专区已经发动农民检查、翻晒种子，并且采取互相支援的办法解决缺种困难。潮安、五华、英德等县有许多农业社已开始订冬种计划，安排冬种劳力。
    今年全省冬种面积将要比去年扩大五百万亩。为了吸取过去部分地区不顾自然条件种植单一作物，而受灾害损失的教训，今年决定大力贯彻因地制宜的方针，栽培甘薯、豆类、小麦等多种作物。
