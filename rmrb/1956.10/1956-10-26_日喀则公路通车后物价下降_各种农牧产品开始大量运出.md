Xinhua News Agency Report: Since the Lhasa-to-Shigatse and Shigatse-to-Gyangtse highways were opened to traffic on October 20th of last year, they have increasingly shown their important role in the economic lives of the Tibetan people.

In the past year, the state-owned transportation department transported more than 1,550 tons of goods such as tea, general merchandise, and food to Shigatse. The variety of domestic goods displayed in the Shigatse branch of the State-owned Tibet Trading General Company's store has increased by about seven times compared to before the highway was opened. The prices of domestic goods have also decreased by an average of more than 12% compared to last year. In the past, tea prices often rose due to transportation difficulties, but in the past year, prices have been reduced three times in a row.

In the past, it took more than a month of arduous travel to travel back and forth between the three major cities of Tibet - Lhasa, Shigatse, and Gyangtse, and sometimes one had to brave wind and snow and sleep in uninhabited barren mountains. Now, by taking a comfortable car, it only takes four days to make a round trip. Now, on average, one bus departs from Shigatse to Gyangtse every day and a half. In the past year, more than 6,000 passengers have taken buses from Shigatse to various parts of Tibet.

Various agricultural and pastoral products and local specialties produced in the Shigatse area have also begun to be transported out in large quantities. This year, state-owned trading organizations have expanded the procurement of local specialties, with wool alone increasing fourfold compared to last year. Grain produced in agricultural areas has also begun to be transported by truck to pastoral areas in need of grain. Timber grown hundreds of kilometers away in the Himalayas was transported to Shigatse in large quantities for the first time this year. The newly completed Nyang Chu River Bridge and Shigatse Thermal Power Plant were built with the famous red pine and larch from the Himalayas. This kind of wood is now being continuously transported from these two highways to support the construction of many towns in central Tibet.

### 日喀则公路通车后物价下降  各种农牧产品开始大量运出

    日喀则公路通车后物价下降
    各种农牧产品开始大量运出
    新华社讯　拉萨到日喀则，日喀则到江孜两条公路从去年10月20日通车以来，在藏族人民经济生活中日益显示出重要作用。
    这一年中，国营运输部门运了一千五百五十多吨茶叶、百货、食品等货物到日喀则，国营西藏贸易总公司日喀则办事处门市部陈列的国货品种，比公路通车前增加了约七倍。国货的价格也比去年平均降低了百分之十二以上。过去由于运输困难而经常涨价的茶叶，一年来连续降了三次价。
    过去，要在西藏三大城市——拉萨、日喀则、江孜往返一趟，需要一个多月的艰苦行程，有时还要冒着风雪赶路，露宿在没有人烟的荒山上。现在坐上舒适的汽车。化上四天时间就可以打个来回。现在，平均一天半就有一辆客车从日喀则开往江孜，一年来已有六千多位乘客从日喀则搭车到西藏各地。
    日喀则地区出产的各种农牧产品和土特产品，也开始大量运出。今年国营贸易机构扩大了土特产品的收购量，仅羊毛一项就比去年增加四倍。农业区出产的粮食，也已开始用汽车运往需粮的牧区。生长在数百公里外的喜马拉雅山上的木材，今年第一次大量运来日喀则。新近落成的年楚河大桥和日喀则火电厂，就是用喜马拉雅山上有名的红松和落叶松建成的。这种木材现在正源源不断地从这两条公路运出，支援西藏中部许多城镇的建设。
