Relics
—Hanoi Letters
Yuan Ying

We arrived at Phan Đình Phùng Street, shaded by tall phoenix trees, and the car stopped at the north gate of Hanoi's ancient city.

The north gate now only remains as a historical relic, a gate tower with three large characters. The city gate has long been blocked. Vietnamese comrades pointed to the two large holes in the city wall and told us: this is where French colonialists shelled Hanoi in 1884.

After the signing of the Geneva Accords, restoring peace to Indochina, the colonialists were very reluctant to withdraw from this beautiful city, but what could they do? Facing them was no longer a weak feudal dynasty, but the powerful Vietnamese people.

However, even at the end of their road, these "heroes" still wanted to leave behind some "achievements." It has been more than a year since Hanoi's liberation, and people still look on with scorn, mocking the last battle of these Western "heroes."

Let's talk about a Western-style house by Hoàn Kiếm Lake. This house was once the private residence of the French Deputy Governor of Vietnam. This Deputy Governor really knew how to arrange things for himself. His house cut off the picturesque scenery of Hoàn Kiếm Lake. After the Deputy Governor left, General Cogny, commander-in-chief of the expeditionary forces, commanded the war of aggression against Indochina here. Regarding the results of this war, we naturally don't need to recall much now. Anyway, people remember how embarrassingly he left Hanoi. When the last batch of French colonialists withdrew from this house, they swept away all the furniture and decorations, even the lamps and curtains were not spared by these "heroes."

Now, who lives here? The organ of the Vietnam Labor Party – "Nhân Dân" ("The People"). This is probably something that the Deputy Governor, General Cogny, and other "heroes" never imagined.

A comrade from "Nhân Dân" told me:
"Fortunately, they left the doors."

In fact, what they left behind was not just the doors. Yesterday, we went to Thụy Phương Pagoda, twelve kilometers from Hanoi. On the way, we saw a group of farmers demolishing a large bunker, using the bricks to build houses. This large bunker was strategically located on the banks of the Red River. One can imagine how it once grimly overlooked the villages on the plains around it. Now, under the feet of the farmers, it is only crumbling tiles and broken walls. Green grass has grown on the piles of red bricks and tiles, dimming in the sunset.

Isn't this an excellent depiction of the fate of colonialists? Back then, warships came from the east, bringing troops to the city, they were "powerful for a time, but where are they now!" History is merciless, the people are immortal. Throughout history, what else have colonialists left behind besides a shameful end and being a laughingstock for others?

    遗迹    
    ——河内书简
    袁鹰
    我们来到被高大的凤凰树所遮盖的潘廷凤路，车停在河内古城的正北门下。
    正北门，如今只留下一个作为历史陈迹的城楼和三个大字，城门早已堵塞了。越南同志指着城墙上的两个大窟窿，告诉我们：这就是1884年法国殖民者攻打河内时，落下炮弹的地方。
    恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦协定签订以后，殖民主义者是很不情愿地从这个美丽的城市撤退的，可又有什么办法呢？在他们面前的，不再是懦弱的封建王朝，而是强大的越南人民。
    但是，“英雄”即使到了末路，也还想留下一些“业绩”。河内解放一年多了，人们还是以鄙视的神情嘲笑那些西方来的“英雄”们的最后一战。
    我们且说还剑湖边的一座洋房吧。这洋房，当年是法国驻越南副总督的私邸。这位副总督真会给自己安排，他的这座洋房，切断了还剑湖的绮丽风光。副总督走后，远征军总司令戈涅将军在这里指挥过侵略印度支那的战争。关于这场战争的结果，我们现在自然无须多加回忆，反正人们是记得他是怎样狼狈地离开河内的。最后一批法国殖民者撤离这座洋房的时候，将所有的家具、装饰席卷而去，甚至连电灯、窗帘，在“英雄”们的手下都没有幸免。
    现在，谁住在这里呢？越南劳动党机关报——“人民报”。这大约是副总督、戈涅将军以及其他“英雄”们完全没有想到过的事。
    “人民报”的同志对我说：
    “幸而他们留下了门。”
    其实，他们留下的并不只是门。昨天，我们到距河内十二公里的瑞芳寺去，途中，看见一群农民正在拆毁一座大地堡，用砖头去造房屋。这大地堡虎踞在红河岸上，可以想见它曾经怎样狰狞地俯视它周围平原上的农村。如今，在农民们的脚下，它只剩下败瓦颓垣，红色的砖瓦堆上长了青草，在夕阳下暗然无光。
    这岂不是一幅殖民主义者下场的绝好写照么？想当年炮舰东来，兵临城下，“固一世之雄也，而今安在哉！”历史无情，人民不朽。古往今来，殖民主义者除了一个可耻的下场和遭人唾骂的笑柄以外，还留下一些什么呢？
        （9月9日，河内）
