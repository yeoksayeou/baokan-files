Xinhua News Agency, October 28th – A Peking Opera performance was held this afternoon in the auditorium of the Beijing Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference. The performers were almost all former high-ranking officials in the Kuomintang government, and their average age was over fifty.

This was the first performance of the Peking Opera Group organized by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. The performance programs were "Lianhuan Tao (Linked Rings)" and the complete opera "Si Lang Visits His Mother".

More than 1,800 people watched the performance, which lasted more than three hours. Li Jishen, Xiong Kewu, Cai Tingkai, Chen Mingshu, Shao Lizi, Weng Wenhao, Jiang Guangnai, and other leaders of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang watched the entire performance.

Chu Xichun, a member of the National Committee of the CPPCC and former Chairman of Hebei Province under the Kuomintang, and Shen Ke, former Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang's Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui Border Region, played the roles of the First and Second Imperial Uncles in "Si Lang Visits His Mother".

During the performance of "Si Lang Visits His Mother", the audience applauded to welcome the sixty-six-year-old Liu Kun, who played the princess's maid. He had served as a staff officer in the Second Army during the Northern Expedition, and later served as the Director-General of the Slaughter Tax and Peanut Tax Bureau of Henan Province under the Kuomintang. The actors playing the Liao and Song soldiers were mostly former Kuomintang army officers with the rank of major general or higher. Wang Naiwen, the wife of National People's Congress representative Zaitao, played the princess in "Si Lang Visits His Mother" today.

    据新华社28日讯　北京市的政协礼堂里，今天下午举行了一次京剧演出会。参加演出的演员几乎都曾在国民党政府里担任过要职，他们的平均年龄在五十岁以上。
    这是中国国民党革命委员会北京市委员会所组织的京剧组的第一次演出，演出节目是连环套和全本四郎探母。
    一千八百多人观看了这个为时三小时多的演出。中国国民党革命委员会负责人李济深、熊克武、蔡廷锴、陈铭枢、邵力子、翁文灏、蒋光鼐等人都观看了全部演出。
    政协全国委员会委员、原国民党河北省省主席楚溪春和原国民党苏、鲁、豫、皖边区副总司令沈克，在四郎探母中扮演大国舅和二国舅。
    演出“四郎探母”的时候，观众都鼓掌欢迎六十六岁的刘鲲扮演的公主的丫环。他在北伐战争中曾任第二集团军参议，后来又担任国民党河南省屠宰税兼花生税总局局长。担任辽兵、宋兵的演员，大都曾在国民党军队中担任过少将以上的军官。全国人民代表大会代表载涛的夫人王乃文今天扮演“四郎探母”中的公主。
