Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 29th. According to the Czechoslovak News Agency, the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak National Front held a meeting in Prague on October 27th.

    The meeting discussed and approved plans for celebrating the 39th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution and holding the Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship Month. These annual celebrations will be held this year under the slogan "Strive for the Victory of Socialism and Peace Together with the Soviet Union."

    The meeting also discussed the tasks of the National Front in preparing for the Third National Congress of Unified Agricultural Cooperatives, which will be held in March next year.

    The Presidium emphasized that further developing unified agricultural cooperatives and greatly intensifying production, as well as increasing labor productivity, is the only correct path to completing the agricultural tasks in the Second Five-Year Plan. From July 1, 1955, to October 15, 1956, 1,793 new agricultural cooperatives have been established nationwide, with nearly 46,000 members and 235,000 hectares (15 mu per hectare) of land. In 1953, only a quarter of the cooperatives had work-unit remuneration higher than 16 crowns (Czechoslovak currency), while by 1955, about half of the cooperatives had reached this figure. Today, all the prerequisites are being created to continue to advance this victorious development. The Presidium believes that this development can be accelerated as long as certain shortcomings are eliminated and existing potential is utilized.

    The Presidium also believes that conditions currently exist to ensure that the socialist component occupies a decisive position in land and agricultural production by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) through the development of agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, in the months leading up to the Agricultural Cooperative Congress, the tasks of further developing agricultural cooperatives will be widely discussed.

    “和苏联一起争取社会主义和和平的胜利”
    捷民族阵线决定庆祝十月革命节计划
    新华社布拉格29日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道，捷克斯洛伐克民族阵线中央委员会主席团10月27日在布拉格举行会议。
    会议讨论并且通过了庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十九周年和举行捷苏友好月的计划。这些每年举行的庆祝会今年将在“和苏联一起争取社会主义和和平的胜利”口号下举行。
    会议还讨论了民族阵线筹备召开统一农业合作社第三次全国代表大会的任务，这次代表大会将在明年3月间举行。
    主席团强调指出，进一步发展统一农业合作社和大大加紧生产以及提高劳动生产率是完成第二个五年计划中农业方面的任务的唯一正确道路。从1955年7月1日到1956年10月15日，全国已经成立了一千七百九十三个新的农业合作社，这些合作社拥有将近四万六千个社员和二十三万五千公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）的土地。1953年只有四分之一的合作社的劳动单位报酬高于十六克朗（捷币），而到1955年就约有一半的合作社达到这个数字。今天正在创造一切先决条件来继续推进这个胜利的发展。主席团认为，只要消除某些缺点和利用现有的潜力就有可能使这一发展更加迅速。
    主席团还认为，目前存在着这样的条件，就是通过发展农业合作社来使社会主义成分到第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）结束时在土地和农业生产方面都占有决定的位置。因此，在农业合作社代表大会之前的几个月中将广泛讨论进一步发展农业合作社的任务。
