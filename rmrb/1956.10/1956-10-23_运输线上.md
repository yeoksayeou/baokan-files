On the Transportation Lines

    Highway Transportation Remains Tense

    The tense situation of passenger transportation on the Beijing-Hankou and Longhai Railways is gradually easing. Many temporary passenger trains have been added to these railways in the past month. Currently, the passenger train transportation order on the main railway lines is basically normal. Tickets are easier to buy than in August and September.

    In terms of railway freight transportation, due to the increase in seasonal goods such as coal for the winter, the daily freight volume since October has increased by 4.6% compared to September. The busiest Beijing-Hankou and Longhai Railways have reached their transportation capacity saturation point. Other main railway lines are also somewhat strained due to the continuous increase in freight volume, but there is no backlog of goods.

    On all national highways, the tense transportation situation has not been alleviated due to the continued increase in cargo requested by cargo owners. Only a few provinces, either because the automobiles allocated by the State Council have joined the transportation efforts, or because they have strengthened transportation organization, are able to ensure that major commodities in the market are not out of stock and that major capital construction projects do not have to stop work due to lack of materials.

    Sichuan River Passenger Transport Situation Improves

    The tense situation of passenger transport on the Sichuan River has begun to ease. Since the beginning of October, passengers leaving and entering Sichuan have been able to travel on schedule according to their reserved ticket dates; passengers who were previously stranded in Chongqing and Hankou were transported by the end of September.

    Before September, Sichuan River passenger transport could not meet the needs of passengers, and the number of passengers waiting for ships in Chongqing Port and other places increased, reaching a maximum of about 7,000 people. Since September, the Yangtze River shipping department has taken emergency and effective measures to increase the passenger transport capacity of each route at Chongqing Port by more than 40%, and the passenger transport situation has improved immediately. Currently, the practice of opening cargo holds for passenger transport on the Sichuan River route has been cancelled. Some passenger ships that sailed between Chongqing and Yichang during the tense period have been restored to direct liners between Chongqing and Hankou.

    Lanzhou Implements Double-Shift Transportation

    Since January of this year, the Lanzhou Transportation Company has implemented a day-and-night double-shift transportation system on six routes, including Dingxi to Xiji, Lanzhou to Xining, and Jiuquan to Mangya. After the implementation of this measure, the transportation capacity of each vehicle has increased by 60% compared to the past, which has played a great role in solving the current shortage of transportation capacity.

    Double-shift transportation means that one vehicle is equipped with two drivers, who take turns driving so that the vehicle can travel day and night while the drivers rest. For safe transportation, the company requires drivers to be familiar with road conditions and strictly implement operating procedures and speed limits. When handing over shifts, drivers must report road conditions, weather, and vehicle conditions to the incoming driver so that the incoming driver is aware of the situation while driving. As a result, the number of traffic accidents on double-shift routes in this company has also been greatly reduced compared to the beginning.

    Qinghai Organizes Flatbed Cart Transportation

    Since the beginning of this year, more than 6,000 flatbed carts loaded with various construction materials, coal, and daily necessities have frequently traveled through the main thoroughfares of Xining City and on several highways such as Ganqing. These vehicles all belong to the agricultural production cooperatives in the agricultural areas of Qinghai Province.

    As winter approaches and urban capital construction will soon be completed one after another, the two to three thousand flatbed carts currently concentrated in Xining City will be transferred to highways such as Ganqing and Ningda (Xining-Datong) to transport the accumulated construction materials and coal and other materials there. It is estimated that in the fourth quarter of this year, an average of 3,000 flatbed carts will participate in transportation on the Ganqing line each month; by the end of the year, these vehicles can transport nearly 20,000 tons of coal and other materials from Hekou to Xining.

    运输线上
    公路运输仍然紧张
    京汉、陇海等铁路旅客运输紧张情况渐趋缓和。在这几条铁路上，近一个月来加开了很多临时旅客列车。目前各铁路干线上旅客列车运输秩序基本正常。车票已比八、九月间好买一些。
    在铁路的货物运输方面，因为过冬用煤等季节性的物资增多，10月以来，每天的货物运量又比9月上涨了4.6％。最繁忙的京汉、陇海等铁路，运输货物的能力已达饱和状态。其他各铁路干线，因为运量不断上涨，都有些吃紧，但还没积压物资现象。
    全国各公路线上，因为货主要求运输的货物继续增多，运输紧张情况还没有减轻。只有个别省份，或是因为国务院调拨的汽车已经参加运输，或是因为加强了运输组织工作，能够做到市场上主要商品不脱销，较大的基本建设工程不停工待料。
    川江客运情况好转
    川江客运的紧张情况已经开始缓和。10月上旬以来，旅客出川和入川，都能按预定客票日期随到随走；过去停留在重庆、汉口两地的旅客，在9月底便运送完毕。
    9月份以前，川江客运不能满足旅客需要，在重庆港等候轮船的旅客愈来愈多，最多的时候曾经达到七千人左右。从9月份起，长江航运部门采取紧急有效措施，使重庆港各条航线的客运能力增加了40％以上，因而客运情况随即好转。目前川江航线上开放货仓载客的办法已经取消。紧张时期中航行重庆、宜昌间的部分客轮，已经恢复成为重庆——汉口间的直达班轮。
    兰州实行双班运输
    兰州运输公司从今年1月份起，先后在定西到西吉、兰州到西宁、酒泉到茫崖等六条线路上实行了日夜双班制运输。这一措施实行以后使每辆汽车的运输能力比过去提高了60％，对于解决目前运输力不足起了很大作用。
    双班运输就是一辆汽车配备两个司机，司机轮流驾驶，人休息车不休息，使车辆能够日夜行驶。为了安全运输，公司要求司机要熟悉路况，严格执行操作规程和时速规定。司机们在交班的时候，要向接班司机报告路况、气候和车况，使接班司机在行驶时心中有数。由于这样，这个公司在双班路线上发生的行车事故也比开始时大大减少。
    青海组织大板车运货
    今年以来，满载着各种建筑器材、煤炭和日用百货的六千多辆大板车，频繁地穿行在西宁市的通衢要道和甘青等几条公路线上，这些车辆都是属于青海省农业区农业生产合作社的。
    冬季来临，城市基本建设即将陆续收工，目前集中在西宁市的两、三千辆大板车将被抽调到甘青、宁大（西宁——大通）等公路线上，运输积压在那里的建筑器材和煤炭等物资。据估计，今年第四季度，在甘青线上每个月平均将要有三千辆大板车参加运输；到年底为止，这些车辆可以从河口运进西宁近两万吨煤炭等物资。　（据新华社讯）
