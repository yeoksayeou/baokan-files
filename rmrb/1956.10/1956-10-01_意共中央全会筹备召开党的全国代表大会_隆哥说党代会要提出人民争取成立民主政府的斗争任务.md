Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 30th. According to TASS, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party, which began on September 26, closed on the 29th. This plenary session was convened to prepare for the Party's Eighth National Congress. The agenda of the Eighth National Congress is: 1. A report by the General Secretary of the Party Central Committee, Togliatti, on the struggle for Italy to embark on the road to socialism; 2. Revision of the Party Constitution; 3. Election of the Central Committee.

The Deputy General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Longo, delivered a report on the preparations for the Eighth Party Congress at the plenary session of the Central Committee. In his report, Longo pointed out that the purpose of the draft outline of the Congress formulated by the Central Committee's special committee is to clearly explain the new issues posed to the Party by the development of the international situation and the domestic situation. He said that the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union raised the most important issues to the international workers' movement and the communist movement. We are referring to the world situation, the balance of power between the imperialist camp and the socialist camp, the new prospects for peaceful coexistence, the possibility of avoiding war, and the various new paths to the transition to socialism.

Longo said: In this international situation and its development, the domestic situation has also taken on a new aspect, therefore, many domestic issues have new formulations, and new possibilities for solving problems have emerged. Our task is to discover and affirm these possibilities.

Longo pointed out that broad and active discussions on these issues demonstrate the vitality of the Party, demonstrate the participation of activists in summarizing our experiences and formulating our political line, and demonstrate the reality and significance of the issues discussed. However, the discussion also revealed some shortcomings. Not everything that is said and proposed is truly new, truly acceptable in the new situation. No opinion or idea should be allowed to circulate freely within the Party. Longo emphasized that under no circumstances should the struggle against bourgeois ideology be relaxed, nor should the opposition to its influence on our ranks be relaxed.

When mentioning the issue of opposing the personality cult, Longo said that although some people in the Soviet Union made mistakes, undermining socialist legality, Soviet democracy, and intra-party democracy, the foundations of the Soviet system and its achievements have not been lost.

Longo then spoke about the issue of the working class seizing power in capitalist countries. He pointed out that the sharpness of the struggle and whether or not violence is adopted does not depend on the proletariat, but on whether the exploiters adopt violence. He said that the leading role of the working class is still fully required in the cause of socialist transformation of society. However, new prospects have been opened up in terms of class alliances and the ways of transition to socialism. We believe that in Italy, parliamentary institutions can now be used to implement active plans, and the democratic road to socialism is a path to greater breadth, consolidation, and genuine democracy... This can be achieved by transforming parliament into an institution that truly reflects the will of the people.

Subsequently, Longo analyzed the characteristics of the Italian economic and political situation. He said that the industrial and agricultural proletariat, poor peasants, and intellectuals are the driving force of the Italian democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and around them, it is still possible to unite a wider range of the people, including small landowners, handicraftsmen, small and medium-sized business owners, employees, and many women and young people.

Longo emphasized that the majority of people believe that it is necessary to fundamentally change the current government's policies, and the people demand the abolition of political discrimination, the implementation of the institutional reforms stipulated by the constitution, and the restoration of complete national independence by freeing the country from various interventions by the United States and the Vatican. Longo said that the upcoming Party Congress should propose a task for the people's struggle: to establish a democratic government of all working classes that can meet the above requirements and fully implement the provisions of the constitution.

When talking about foreign policy issues, Longo pointed out that the Italian working people fully support the Egyptian people's struggle for independence. Italy should quickly restore its entire national sovereignty, which has been severely damaged due to its participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Western European Union, the European Coal and Steel Community, and the European Payments Union. He said that Italy should also pursue a relatively independent foreign policy within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that conforms to its national interests. Italy should improve relations with the Soviet Union and all people's democratic countries and recognize the People's Republic of China.

The plenary session launched a discussion on Longo's report. On September 29, Togliatti made a summary of the discussion. The plenary session, based on Togliatti's proposal, established a committee to be responsible for the final revision of the draft outline and the draft declaration of the Party program.

    意共中央全会筹备召开党的全国代表大会
    隆哥说党代会要提出人民争取成立民主政府的斗争任务
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：从9月26日开始举行的意大利共产党中央委员会全体会议已经在29日闭幕。这次全体会议是为筹备党的第八次全国代表大会而召开的。第八次全国代表大会的议程是：一、党中央总书记陶里亚蒂关于争取意大利走上社会主义的道路的报告；二、修改党章；三、中央委员会的选举。
    意大利共产党副总书记隆哥在中央委员会全体会议上作了关于筹备第八次党代表大会的报告。隆哥在报告中指出：中央委员会专门委员会制定的代表大会提纲草案的目的，是明确地阐明国际局势的发展和国内情况向党提出的新问题。他说，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会向国际工人运动和共产主义运动提出了最重要的问题。我们指的是世界局势、帝国主义阵营和社会主义阵营的力量对比、和平共处的新的远景、避免战争的可能性和向社会主义过渡的各种新道路。
    隆哥说：在这种国际形势和它的发展情况下，国内形势也有了新的局面，因此，国内形势的许多问题有了新的提法，产生了解决问题的新的可能性。我们的任务是发掘和肯定这些可能性。
    隆哥指出，对这些问题广泛地、积极地讨论，表明党的生命力，表明积极分子参加总结我们的经验和制定我们的政治路线，表明所讨论的这些问题的现实性和它们的意义。但是，讨论也说明了某些缺点。并不是所讲的和所提出的一切都真正是新的东西、都真正是新情势中所可以接受的东西。不能让任何一种意见和任何一种思想都在党内自由流行。隆哥着重指出，无论怎样决不能放松对资产阶级思想意识的斗争，不能放松反对它对我们队伍的影响。
    隆哥在提到反对个人崇拜问题的时候说，尽管苏联国内有人犯了错误，使社会主义法制、苏维埃民主和党内民主遭到破坏，但是苏联的苏维埃制度的基础和它的成就决没有丧失。
    隆哥接着谈到资本主义国家工人阶级夺取政权的问题，他指出，斗争的尖锐程度和是否采取暴力并不取决于无产阶级，而取决于剥削者是否采取暴力。他说，在社会的社会主义改造事业中，仍然完全要求工人阶级起领导作用。但是在阶级联盟和向社会主义过渡的方式方面打开了新的前景。我们认为，在意大利，现在可以利用议会机构来实现积极的计划，向社会主义过渡的民主道路，是走向更加宽广、更加巩固和真正民主的道路……通过把议会变成真实反映人民意志的机构的办法可以达到这一目的。
    随后，隆哥分析了意大利经济和政治情况的特点。他说，工农业无产者、贫农和知识分子就是意大利民主革命和社会主义革命的动力，在他们的周围现在还能够团结更广大的人民阶层，其中包括小土地所有者、手工业者、中小企业主、职员和许多妇女和青年。
    隆哥着重指出：大部分人认为有必要根本改变目前的政府的方针，人民要求取消政治歧视，实行宪法所规定的机构改革，使国家摆脱美国和梵蒂冈方面的各种干涉而恢复完全独立。隆哥说，即将举行的党代表大会应当提出人民斗争的一个任务：成立一个能够满足上述要求和完全实现宪法各项规定的各劳动者阶级的民主政府。
    隆哥在谈到外交政策问题时指出：意大利劳动人民完全支持埃及人民争取独立的斗争。意大利应当赶快恢复它由于参加北大西洋联盟、西欧联盟、欧洲煤钢联营和欧洲支付同盟而遭到严重损害的整个国家主权。他说，意大利在北大西洋联盟内部也应当奉行符合它的民族利益的比较独立的外交政策。意大利应当改善同苏联和一切人民民主国家的关系以及承认中华人民共和国。
    全体会议就隆哥的报告展开了讨论。9月29日，陶里亚蒂作了讨论总结。全体会议根据陶里亚蒂的建议设立一个委员会来负责最后校订提纲草案和党的纲领声明草案。
