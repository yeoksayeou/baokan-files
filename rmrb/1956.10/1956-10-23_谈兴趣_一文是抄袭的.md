    "Talking About Interests" is Plagiarized
    The essay "Talking About Interests," signed by Li Chuanxin on the eighth page of your newspaper on October 5th, is mostly copied from the section "Interest and Hobby" in Teplov's "Psychology." Many parts are direct excerpts, word for word, while some sentences are slightly "edited." Teplov's "Psychology" is a widely circulated book, and it is quite inappropriate that the editors of the People's Daily did not notice this oversight.

    “谈兴趣”一文是抄袭的
    你报10月5日八版上署名李传信的“谈兴趣”那篇杂文，大部分是根据捷普洛夫的“心理学”一书中“兴趣与爱好”一节转抄过来的，很多地方是原封不动地整段摘录，有些句子则是略略“编辑”了一下。捷普洛夫的“心理学”是流传很广的一本书，人民日报编者却没有注意到，乃是很不应有的疏忽。
