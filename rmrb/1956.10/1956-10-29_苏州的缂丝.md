    Suzhou's kesi silk tapestry, also known as "carved silk," is a sideline occupation of farmers in Suzhou and the areas of Lumu and Likou in Wu County, with a history of about a thousand years.

    Kesi is a combination of silk weaving and painting art, rich in the style of Chinese painting and the characteristics of national form. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, it already had high artistic achievements and was famous at home and abroad. During the Ming Dynasty, Song Yingxing wrote the book "Tiangong Kaiwu," in which the second volume "Nai Fu" contains two entries related to kesi, "Flower Pattern" and "Warping": "Those craftsmen who knot the flower pattern are the most ingenious in their calculations. The painter first draws the desired flower pattern on paper, and the knotter uses silk threads to measure and calculate the dimensions and minutiae according to the drawing to form the pattern, which is hung above the flower tower (the highest part of the flower loom); thus the weaver does not know what flower color will be produced, but threads the warp and weft, and according to the dimensions and degrees, raises the treadles, and after the shuttle passes, the flower appears." In today's terminology, the characteristic of kesi is the so-called "through-warp, discontinuous-weft": "through-warp" means that the pattern is specifically woven only on the warp threads, and "discontinuous-weft" means that the weft threads are interrupted in the middle during weaving. Therefore, after a piece of kesi is woven, it looks exactly the same from either the front or the back, which has the same wonderful effect as the "double-sided embroidery" in embroidery.

    The kesi works of the Ming and Qing Dynasties collected by the Jiangsu Provincial Museum include album leaves and painting scrolls. The album leaves contain eight figure stories such as "Searching for Plum Blossoms in the Snow," "Li Bai Drunk," and "Diaochan under the Moon," which are just like exquisite paintings. Among the hall scrolls of the Qing Dynasty is a huge "Hundred Children Picture," which is very similar to painting, and is called "painted kesi." Modern works include "Five Elders Picture" and "The Drunken Concubine"; modern works include "Cowherd and Weaver Girl" and "Golden Peony"; there are also cushions made of kesi, with various patterns such as "Round Dragon" and "Bat" woven on them, which have promotion value, especially in terms of practical significance.

    Before liberation, due to the devastation of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and the impact of imperialist commodity dumping, the kesi industry was almost "destroyed and the art lost." In recent years, the People's Government has vigorously promoted it, searched for old artists everywhere, and called on them to take apprentices, so as to save this industry. However, the kesi artists have withered away, and only a few old artists such as Wang Maoxian and Shen Jinshui have been found, all of whom are gray-haired. The old artists lamented: If the People's Government had not advocated it, our industry would have been finished soon. Now these old artists are all in the Suzhou Embroidery Arts and Crafts Production Cooperative, continuing to create and striving to cultivate new forces.

    苏州的缂丝
    朱契
    苏州的缂丝，一名“刻丝”。它是苏州和吴县陆墓、蠡口一带农民的副业，已经有一千年左右的历史了。
    缂丝是丝织和绘画艺术的结合，富有国画的风格和民族形式的特点。在十二、三世纪的时候，它已有很高的艺术成就，驰名国内外。明朝人宋应星，著有“天工开物”一书，其中第二卷“乃服”中有“花本”及“穿经”两条，便是与缂丝有关：“凡工匠结花本者，心计最精巧。画师先画何等花色于纸上，结本者以丝线随画量度，算计分寸杪忽而结成之，张悬花楼（即花机的最高部分）之上；即织者不知成何花色，穿综带经，随其尺寸度数，提起衢脚，梭过之后，居然花现。”用现在的术语来说，缂丝的特点，便是所谓“通经继纬”：“通经”就是画样专在经线上面挖织，“断纬”就是织的时候在纬线中间隔断。因此一幅缂丝织成以后，无论从正反哪一面看来，都完全相同，和刺绣中的“双面绣”，有异曲同工之妙。
    江苏省博物馆收藏的明、清两代缂丝作品中，有册页和画轴。册页内容有“踏雪寻梅”、“李白醉酒”、“月下貂蝉”等人物故事八幅，俨然绝妙的图画。清代的堂轴中有巨幅“百子图”，竟同绘画十分相似，叫做“画缂”。近代的作品中有“五老图”和“贵妃醉酒”等；现代作品有“牛郎织女”和“金地牡丹”等；还有用缂丝做的靠垫，上面织着“团龙”、“蝙蝠”等各式图案，在实用意义上，尤有推广的价值。
    缂丝一业，在解放以前，由于国民党反动统治的摧残，以及帝国主义商品倾销的影响，几乎“人亡艺绝”。近年以来，人民政府大力提倡，到处找寻老艺人，号召带徒弟，才把这一业挽救转来。可是缂丝艺人已经雕零殆尽，仅找到王茂仙、沈金水等几位老艺人，都已经白发苍苍了。老艺人慨叹地说：不是人民政府提倡，我们这一行就快要完了。现在这些老艺人都在苏州市刺绣工艺美术生产合作社，除继续创作外，并努力培养新生力量。
