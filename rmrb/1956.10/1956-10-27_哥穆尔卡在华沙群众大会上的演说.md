Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 26th October. Gomulka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, delivered a speech at a rally held by party leaders with the people of Warsaw in front of the Palace of Culture and Science on 24th October. The full text is as follows:

	Comrades, citizens, working people of the capital:

	I extend my greetings to you on behalf of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party. The Central Committee, at its last plenary session, handed over the helm of the Party to a new leadership.

	In the past few years, many bad, unjust, and heartbreakingly disappointing things have accumulated. The socialist ideals permeated with the spirit of human freedom and respect for civil rights have, in fact, been extremely distorted. Words did not match deeds. The hard work of the working class and the people of the whole country did not produce the expected results.

	I am convinced that these years are gone forever.

	The Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party has implemented a historically significant transition. It marks the beginning of a new period in our work, the beginning of a new period in the history of socialist construction in Poland, in the history of this country.

	The Party leadership has told the working class and the people of the whole country the whole truth, without concealing the difficulties that we must overcome regarding our economic and political situation, if we are to move forward in order to achieve lasting improvements in the lives of the working people of Poland.

	The Party leadership does not want to and will not make empty promises to the people. We appeal to our class, to the working class, to the intellectuals, and to the peasants with full confidence. We say to them: we have the strong production capacity built up by the efforts of the working people in the past few years, but these capacities have not been properly utilized; in our national economy, in thousands of factories and mines, in industry and agriculture, we have a large number of resources, but to a large extent these resources have been consumed due to waste and mismanagement; we have a large number of working class people who are hardworking people who love their jobs and know how to use technology, but despite this, their labor productivity is still very low; we have great potential to increase agricultural output, increase the production of food and industrial raw materials, but this potential is still hampered by the mistakes made in agricultural policy in the past few years.

	Workers and staff in various sectors of the national economy, you should help the Party and the government in the great cause of improving the socialist economy of People's Poland, promote the initiative of excellent managers in your factories, and seek with us the best forms of working-class participation in the management of their factories and mines! Increase labor productivity, fight against waste, and reduce production costs. Make the most of the possibilities of increasing industrial and agricultural output to meet the growing needs of the masses.

	The Party tells the working class this harsh fact.

	The increase in income earned by millions in recent months will only be lasting if the people's increased purchasing power can be met by an increase in the quantity of goods on the market. We cannot increase wages any further at present, because the rope has been stretched so tight that it will break if pulled any further.

	Further wage increases can only be possible under the condition of increasing the quantity of mass consumer goods and reducing production costs. To produce more, better, and cheaper products – this is the only road leading to the improvement of the living standards of the working class and the people of the whole country.

	Comrades, the Eighth Plenary Session, by electing a new leadership for the Party, has begun the struggle against all the phenomena that have hindered and suppressed the democratization of socialist life in the past.

	The Party will demand that its leaders fully take responsibility for fulfilling the duties entrusted to them. Those who have lost trust due to stupidity and serious mistakes cannot hold responsible positions. (Applause)

	We can only build the best form of socialism that suits the needs of our country by consistently advancing along the path of democratization and eliminating the ills that characterized the past period. (Applause)

	On this road, the decisive task lies first of all in expanding workers' democracy, enabling the staff to participate more broadly and directly in enterprise management, and enabling the working people in urban and rural areas to participate more broadly in the management of this people's country. At the same time, we will never allow anyone to use this reform and the freedom of the people to achieve anti-socialist goals.

	The Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, based on the needs of the Polish working class and the Polish people, formulated its own path to socialism for our country, thereby providing an effective demonstration of the unbreakable ties between People's Poland and all other socialist countries, especially the alliance between Poland and the Soviet Union.

	The mutual relations between the parties and countries belonging to the socialist camp are united by common goals and interests, so such mutual relations cannot give rise to any misunderstandings. This is one of the main characteristics of socialism. This relationship should be formed on the principle of proletarian internationalism, it should be based on mutual trust and complete equality of rights, on mutual assistance, on mutual benevolent criticism (if such criticism is needed), and it should be based on a sound solution to all contentious issues – a solution arising from a friendly spirit and from the spirit of socialism.

	Within the scope of this relationship, each country should possess complete sovereignty and independence, and the right of each nation to establish a sovereign government in an independent country should be fully and mutually respected.

	Independent nations and autonomous countries, in the process of building a system of social justice—a socialist system—are internally consolidated by the strong, indestructible will to achieve this goal in a way that best suits their own country, but at the same time, they should be most closely linked to each other, and should take common and consistent actions in their relations with other countries, in order to strengthen, through common efforts and firm attitudes, the invincible idea of peace shared by all mankind, and to strengthen the struggle for peaceful cooperation among all countries in the world.

	The pillar of such an alliance of all socialist countries is the Soviet Union, the country with the longest history of socialist construction and the most powerful socialist country in the world.

	In this way, we see our position in the world socialist camp, and in this way, we understand our fraternal and friendly relations with the Soviet Union. We are deeply convinced that the friendship between Poland and the Soviet Union, built on such Leninist principles, will be a true fraternal friendship, a friendship that arises from the hearts of the people of the whole country, and not just from the official policies of the Party and the government. (Long and sustained cheers)

	I can assure you that these principles are being understood more and more, and that both our Party and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union agree on these principles. Our recent meeting with the delegation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has enabled the Soviet comrades to have a clearer understanding of the political situation in Poland.

	We recently received assurances from Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, who said that he sees no reason why the mutual relations between our two countries, parties and governments should not be in accordance with the principles formulated by the Eighth Plenary Session of our Party Central Committee. (Long and sustained cheers)

	All specific issues relating to our internal affairs will be resolved according to the opinions of the Party and the government. Whether Soviet military experts and advisors are necessarily needed in our army, and for how long, depends entirely on our decision. (Long and sustained applause)

	At the same time, we have obtained Comrade Khrushchev's assurance that the Soviet troops in Polish territory will return within two days to the bases where they are stationed according to international treaties and in accordance with the provisions of the Warsaw Pact. (Cheers)

	This is closely related to the stationing of Soviet troops in the German Democratic Republic.

	As long as there are Atlantic Pact bases in West Germany, as long as new Bundeswehr forces are being armed there and are inciting chauvinism and revisionism against our borders, the stationing of Soviet troops in Germany is in line with our highest survival interests. This is also in line with the interests of the working people of the German Democratic Republic, because the armaments and threats of the militarists and revanchist groups in West Germany are also directed against them.

	In this situation, we should more resolutely resist all attempts by reactionary and anti-people forces to provoke anti-Soviet disturbances and all conspiracies by international reactionaries hoping to weaken the alliance between our fraternal countries.

	Comrades! The Eighth Plenary Session of our Party has been warmly welcomed by the working class and the broadest masses of the people. In thousands of rallies held across the country, workers, intellectuals, students, soldiers, and all working people have expressed their satisfaction with and support for the Party's new leadership, and have expressed their trust in the Party's new leadership.

	For us, for our Party, for the Party's leadership, there is nothing more important than this trust and support. For the people, for the realization of the people's wishes and efforts, there is nothing more important than the unity between the Party and the people—this unprecedentedly strong unity. On behalf of the Central Committee, I express my warmest thanks to the workers of many factories and mines who, with lofty enthusiasm, announced that they are willing to work overtime, or even buy national bonds (although there is no such need at present), or even sacrifice a portion of their income to help the people's government and the Party's new leadership. I express my thanks to the Polish students who have shown such great enthusiasm and confidence in the Party these days. I express my thanks to the soldiers and officers of the Polish army who have shown their loyalty to the Party and the government and support the results of the Eighth Plenary Session. The people can fully trust the armed forces and their commands (applause), because in our country, as in the whole world, they are completely subordinate to the government of their own country. (Applause)

	Comrades, the Eighth Plenary Session has unleashed a wave of unprecedented political activism among the masses, and along with this wave, forces opposed to socialism, opposed to the Poland-Soviet alliance, and opposed to the People's Government have emerged in various places, forces that want to undermine, obstruct, and reverse the efforts of socialist democratization. Comrades, let us not allow reactionary agitators and various rascals to obstruct our path. Drive them away from the lofty path of the struggle of national socialist and patriotic forces. Drive away provocateurs and reactionary troublemakers! The state authorities will not tolerate any actions that endanger the highest interests of Poland and our nation.

	Comrades!

	Time is pressing. The Party must set about solving the daily and difficult problems in our country's economic and national life. What can you do to help the Party and government leadership today? First of all, return to your work posts and show your loyalty to our cause with your intense work or study.

	Today, we appeal to the working people of Warsaw and the whole country: enough rallies and demonstrations have been held! Now is the time to return to daily work with confidence and awareness, believing that the Party, united with the working class and the people of the whole country, will surely be able to lead Poland along a new road towards socialism.

	Long live the unbreakable link between the Party and the working class and all working people!

	Long live socialism!

	Long live People's Poland! (Applause)

    哥穆尔卡在华沙群众大会上的演说
    新华社华沙26日电　波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡10月24日在党的领导人员同华沙人民在文化科学宫前的广场上举行的集会上发表演说，全文如下：
    同志们，公民们，首都的劳动人民们：
    我代表波兰统一工人党中央委员会向你们致敬。中央委员会在上一次全体会议上已经把党交给新的领导机构掌舵了。
    在过去几年中，累积了许多不好的、不正义的和痛心地令人失望的事情。渗透着人的自由和尊重公民权利的精神的社会主义思想，实际上遭到了极度的歪曲。言行不一致。工人阶级和全国人民的辛劳操作没有产生所期待的结果。
    我深信这些年代已经一去不复返了。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会第八次全体会议实行了一种具有历史意义的转变。它标志着我们工作中的一个新时期的开端，标志着波兰社会主义建设的历史中、这个国家的历史中的一个新时期的开端。
    党的领导已经把全部真相告诉给工人阶级和全国人民，对于我们的经济和政治情况，对于如果我们要前进以便实现波兰劳动人民生活持久的改善所必须克服的困难毫不隐瞒。
    党的领导不想、也不会对人民作出空泛的诺言。我们完全有信心地向我们的阶级，向工人阶级、向知识分子和农民呼吁。我们对他们说：我们有劳动人民的努力在过去几年中建立起来的强大的生产能力，但是这些能力并没有适当地加以利用，在我们的国民经济中，在成千工厂和矿场中，在工业和农业中，我们有大量的资源，但是在很大的程度上这些资源是由于浪费和管理不当而消耗掉了，我们有人数众多的工人阶级，他们是爱好本行的勤劳的人民，他们知道如何使用技术，但是，尽管如此，他们的劳动生产率仍然很低，我们有增加农业产量、增加粮食和工业原料产量的巨大的潜力，但是，这种潜力仍然受到在过去几年里农业政策中所犯的错误的阻碍。
    国民经济的各个部门中的工人和职员们，你们应当帮助党和政府进行改善人民波兰的社会主义经济的伟大事业，在你们的工厂里促进优秀的管理人员的主动性，和我们一道寻求关于工人阶级参与他们的工矿企业的管理工作的最好的形式！提高劳动生产率，反对浪费，降低生产成本。尽最大可能地来利用增加工业和农业产量的可能性以满足群众的日益增长的需要。
    党告诉工人阶级这个严酷的事实。
    只有当人民的提高了的购买力可以从市场上增加了的货物量中得到满足，数百万人在最近几个月来所得的收入的增加才会是持久的。我们目前不能够再进一步提高工资，因为绳子已经拉得很紧，再拉就要断了。
    要能够进一步提高工资，只有在这样的条件下：增加群众消费品的数量，降低生产成本。要生产出更多、更好、更便宜的产品——这是引向提高工人阶级和全国人民的生活水平的唯一道路。
    同志们，第八次全体会议由于选举了党的新的领导，从而开始了对一切在过去阻挠和压制社会主义生活民主化的现象的斗争。
    党将要求它的领袖们充分负责履行委托给他们的职责。那些由于愚蠢、严重错误而丧失信任的人是不能够担负负责的职务的。（掌声）
    我们只有始终不渝地沿着民主化的道路前进，消除作为过去一个时期的特征的弊病，才能够建设一个适应我们国家需要的最好形式的社会主义。（掌声）
    在这条道路上，决定性的任务首先在于扩大工人的民主，使工作人员更广泛地直接参加企业管理，使城乡劳动人民更广泛地参加管理这个人民的国家。而同时，我们也决不允许任何人利用这次改革和人民的自由来达到反对社会主义的目的。
    中央委员会第八次全体会议根据波兰工人阶级和波兰人民的需要，拟订了我国走向社会主义的自己的道路，从而提供了人民波兰和其他所有社会主义国家的牢不可破的联系，特别是波苏两国的联盟的有效的证明。
    属于社会主义阵营的各党之间和各国之间的相互关系是由共同的目标和利益团结起来的，因此这种相互关系不可能产生任何误会。这一点是社会主义主要的特征之一。这种关系应该在工人阶级国际团结的原则上形成，它应当以相互信任和权利的完全平等、以相互援助、以相互的善意批评（如果需要这种批评的话）为基础，它应当以对一切争论问题有一个健全的解决办法——从友好的精神中和从社会主义的精神中产生的解决办法为基础。
    在这种关系的范围以内，各个国家应当拥有完全的主权和独立，各个民族在一个独立的国家建立一个主权政府的权利应当充分地和相互地受到尊重。
    独立的民族和自主的国家，在建设一个社会正义的制度——社会主义的制度的过程中，其内部由于要按照最适合本国的方式来达到这个目标的坚强的、不可摧毁的意志得到了巩固，但是在同时还应当彼此最紧密地联结在一起，在同其他国家的关系中应当采取共同的一致的行动，以便依靠共同的努力和坚决的态度来加强全体人类都有的不可战胜的和平思想，加强争取全世界各国和平合作的斗争。
    这样一个全体社会主义国家的联盟的支柱，是全世界社会主义建设历史最久的国家和最强大的社会主义国家苏联。
    这样，我们看到了我们在世界社会主义阵营中的地位，这样，我们懂得了我们同苏联的兄弟友好关系。我们深信，波兰和苏联之间建立在这样的列宁主义原则基础上的友谊将是一种真正的兄弟友谊，这样的友谊是从全国人民的心灵中产生的，而不仅是从党和政府的官方政策中产生的。（经久不息的欢呼）
    我可以向你们肯定地说，这些原则得到了越来越大的谅解，我们党和苏联共产党都同意这些原则。我们同苏联共产党代表团举行的最近一次会议使得苏联同志能够比较清楚地了解波兰的政治形势。
    我们最近从苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫同志那里得到了保证，他说他认为我们两国的党和政府的相互关系没有理由不应当按照我们党中央委员会第八次全体会议所拟定的原则。（经久不息的欢呼）
    一切有关我们内政的具体问题将按照党和政府的意见来进行解决。在我们的军队中是否必定需要苏联军事专家和顾问，并且需要他们多久，完全取决于我们的决定。（经久不息的掌声）
    同时，我们已经获得了赫鲁晓夫同志的保证，在波兰领土上的苏联军队将在两天之内回到他们根据国际条约、按照华沙条约的规定所驻扎的基地去。（欢呼）
    这是和苏联军队驻扎在德意志民主共和国有密切的联系的。
    只要在西德有大西洋公约的基地、只要新的国防军正在那里被武装起来并且正在煽动沙文主义和煽动对我们的边界的修正主义，苏联军队驻扎在德国就是符合于我们最高的生存利益的。这也是符合于德意志民主共和国劳动人民的利益的，因为西德的军国主义者和复仇主义者集团的军备和威胁也是针对他们的。
    在这种情况下，我们应该更加坚决地抵抗反动的和反人民的势力企图挑起反苏骚动的一切尝试和国际反动派希望削弱我们兄弟国家间的联盟的一切阴谋。
    同志们！我们党的八中全会受到了工人阶级和最广大的人民群众的热烈欢迎。在全国各地举行的数以千计的集会上，工人、知识分子、学生、军人以及全体劳动人民表示对党的新的领导机构感到满意和支持，表示了他们对党的新的领导机构的信任。
    对我们、对我们的党、对党的领导机构来说，再没有比这种信任和支持更重要的东西了。对人民、对实现人民的愿望和努力来说，再没有比党和人民间的团结——这种空前强大的团结更重要的东西了。我代表中央委员会，对于许多工矿企业的工人表示最热烈的感谢，他们怀着崇高的热情宣布，他们愿意超时工作，甚至购买国家公债（虽然目前没有这种需要），或者甚至牺牲一部分收入来帮助人民政权和党的新的领导机构。我表示感谢波兰的学生们，他们在这些天表明对党具有那样大的热情和信心。我表示感谢波兰军队的士兵们和军官们，他们表明效忠党和政府而且支持八中全会的结果。人民能够充分信赖武装部队和它们的司令部（掌声），因为他们在我国正像在全世界一样，是完完全全从属于它们自己国家的政府的。（掌声）
    同志们，八中全会使群众发出了无比的政治积极性的浪潮，随着这种浪潮，反对社会主义、反对波苏联盟、反对人民政府的势力又在各处露面了，这种势力是要破坏、阻挠、逆转社会主义民主化的努力。同志们，我们不要让反动的煽动分子和各种无赖阻碍我们的道路。把他们从全国社会主义和爱国力量的斗争的崇高道路上赶走。赶走挑衅分子和反动派滋事分子！国家当局一刻也不容许发生危害波兰最高利益和我国国体的任何行动。
    同志们！
    时间是很紧迫了。党必须着手解决我国经济生活和国家生活中的日常的和困难的问题。今天你们能够用什么方式帮助党和政府的领导呢？首先是，回到你们的工作岗位上去，用你们的紧张工作或者学习表明你们对我们事业的忠诚。
    今天，我们呼吁华沙和全国劳动人民：集会和示威已经举行够了！现在是怀着信心和觉悟回去做日常工作的时候了，相信党同工人阶级和全国人民团结在一起，一定能够领导波兰沿着新的道路走向社会主义。
    党同工人阶级和全体劳动人民的牢不可破的联系万岁！
    社会主义万岁！
    人民波兰万岁！（掌声）
