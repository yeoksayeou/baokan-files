Actively Rushing to Repair the Highway to Karamay

    (Our dispatch) The Karamay-Urho-Hosgerogai Class III highway main line is currently being rushed to repair. As of October 23rd, more than 3,000 laborers from the Production and Construction Corps engineering units have been投入ing themselves into the tense construction.

    This highway is 178 kilometers long, requiring a total of more than 1.6 million cubic meters of earth and stone work. The construction units have overcome difficulties such as the lack of firewood, food, and water in the Gobi Desert, and launched labor emulation drives and rationalization proposal movements. The large-scale assembly line method implemented by the 7th Company of a certain detachment has increased work efficiency from the original 90% to 150%.

    The 36.5-kilometer section of the highway north of Urho has been 55% completed. The entire project is expected to be completed before April next year to ensure the heavy transportation tasks along the oil field during the thaw. (Production Front Newspaper Agency)

    积极抢修通往克拉玛依的公路
    本报讯　克拉玛依—乌尔禾—霍斯格洛盖的三级公路干线目前正在赶修中，到10月23日止，生产兵团工程部队已有三千多个劳动力投入紧张的施工。
    这条公路全长一百七十八公里，需要土方、砂石方共一百六十余万方。施工部队克服了戈壁滩上缺柴、缺粮、缺水的困难，展开了劳动竞赛和合理化建议运动。某支队七中队实行的大型流水作业法，由原来只能完成工效90％提高到150％。
    这条公路在乌尔禾以北的三十六点五公里的工程，已完成55％。全部工程预计在明年4月前竣工，以保证开冻时油矿沿线繁重的运输任务。　（生产战线报社）
