Xinhua News Agency, Xining. At the second plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Qinghai Provincial Committee, which closed on September 28, the discussion focused on how to gradually carry out the socialist transformation of the animal husbandry economy in pastoral areas. Since last year, the masses of herdsmen in some areas of Qinghai have actively demanded to take the road of cooperation. At the same time, with the support and sponsorship of local representatives, more than 30 livestock production cooperatives and one joint state-private ranch have been established on a trial basis in Hainan, Haibei, Haixi, Huangnan and other autonomous prefectures. Now it seems that the trial work has been basically successful, initially demonstrating the superiority of organizing to overcome the difficulties that cannot be overcome in individual production, so that animal husbandry production can be rapidly developed. The resolution of the meeting pointed out that in the future, it is necessary to vigorously publicize the state's policy of gradually implementing the socialist peaceful transformation of animal husbandry in pastoral areas, and actively conduct pilot projects of animal husbandry cooperatives and joint state-private ranches in areas where conditions permit.

Zhou Renshan, secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out at the meeting: The socialist transformation of animal husbandry should be gradually carried out under the principles of ensuring favorable national unity, developing animal husbandry production, and complete voluntariness, adopting the method of peaceful consultation combining top-down and bottom-up approaches. The policy of "peaceful transformation" of the herdowner economy is to continue to implement the policy of "no struggle, no division, no class designation," and "mutual benefit for herdowners and hired herders," and according to the opinions of the people of this ethnic group and representatives who are connected with the masses, and the willingness of the herdowners, to peacefully negotiate and gradually carry out the transformation.

    青海准备逐步改造畜牧业
    新华社西宁讯　在9月28日闭幕的中国人民政治协商会议青海省委员会第二次全体会议上，着重讨论了在牧业区如何对畜牧业经济逐步进行社会主义改造的问题。去年以来，青海部分地区的牧民群众积极要求走合作化的道路，同时在当地代表人物的拥护和赞助下，在海南、海北、海西、黄南等自治州重点试办了三十多个畜牧业生产合作社和一个公私合营牧场。现在看来试办工作基本上是成功的，初步显示了组织起来可以克服个体生产中所不能克服的困难，使畜牧业生产很快得到发展的优越性。会议的决议中指出：今后要在牧业区大力宣传国家对畜牧业逐步实行社会主义的和平改造的政策，并在有条件的地区积极试办牧业社和公私合营牧场。
    中共青海省委书记周仁山到会指出：要在保证有利民族团结、发展畜牧业生产和完全自愿的原则下，采取自上而下自下而上相结合的和平协商方法，逐步进行对畜牧业的社会主义改造。对牧主经济采取“和平改造”的政策，就是要继续贯彻“不斗不分、不划阶级”，“牧工牧主两利”政策，并根据本民族人民和与人民群众有联系的代表人物的意见及牧主的自愿，和平协商地逐步进行改造。
