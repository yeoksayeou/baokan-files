    Time-Saving "Tips"
    Mao Xianwen
    Person A, holding a newspaper carrying the "Notice from the State Council Regarding Self-Funded Subscriptions for Newspapers and Periodicals Needed by Individuals in State Organs, Groups, Troops, Enterprises, and Schools," muttered incessantly, "From now on, I can save some time every day..."
    Person B heard Person A's words, and to understand, asked, "What is it? Have you figured out a trick for work?"
    "No. Didn't you see the notice about self-funded newspaper subscriptions? Starting in October, the newspapers subscribed to by the public will be cancelled. Is it worth going to the library just to read the newspaper? What a hassle! If I don't read it, I can save some time!"
      "Hey, the time you're saving is a bit too 'that way'. Doesn't the notice encourage organizing collective subscriptions? I think we should..."
    Person A interrupted, "No, even if I don't read the newspaper, it won't be that bad... But, I think this regulation is detrimental to political study."

    节省时间的“窍门”
    毛宪文
    某甲拿着刊载“国务院关于国家机关、团体、部队、企业、学校中私人需要的报刊实行自费订阅的通知”的那张报纸，口中不断地嘟囔着：“今后每天倒也可以节省出一些时间来……”
    某甲的话被某乙听到了，为了弄个明白，所以追问了一句：“怎么，工作想出了窍门？”
    “不是的。你没看到关于自费订报的通知吗？从十月份起公家给订的报纸就要取消了，难道为了看报还值得跑图书馆？找那麻烦！不看，这不就可以节省出一部分时间！”
      “哎，你这时间节省的未免太‘那个’。通知中不是提倡组织集体订阅吗？我看咱们……”
    某甲抢白道：“不，即使不看报也不至于……不过，我看，这规定对政治时事学习是不利的。”
