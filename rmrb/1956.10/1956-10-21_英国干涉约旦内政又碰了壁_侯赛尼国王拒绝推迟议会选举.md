　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 19th, TASS: According to "The People's News," King Hussein of Jordan has rejected Britain's request and refused to postpone the Jordanian parliamentary elections scheduled for October 21st.

　　The newspaper wrote that Britain's request to postpone the elections was due to its attempts to influence the outcome of the Jordanian elections and ensure a pro-Western majority in the future parliament, which had failed. The newspaper also said that the British government intends to use this method to consolidate Britain's position in the Near East, because it has suffered new blows in recent months, especially because the secret conspiracy of Britain, Israel, Turkey, and Iraq colluding to send Iraqi troops into Jordanian territory has been exposed.

    英国干涉约旦内政又碰了壁
    侯赛尼国王拒绝推迟议会选举
    新华社20日讯　塔斯社开罗19日讯：据“人民报”报道，约旦国王侯赛尼拒绝了英国的要求，不答应推延定于10月21日举行的约旦议会选举。
    报纸写道，英国要求推迟选举，是因为企图影响约旦选举的结果，以及确保将来议会中的亲西方多数的尝试遭到了失败的缘故。报纸还说，英国政府打算用这种办法来巩固英国在近东的地位，因为它在最近几个月中遭到了新的打击，特别是因为英国、以色列、土耳其和伊拉克勾结在一起企图把伊拉克军队开进约旦领土的秘密阴谋已经被揭露。
