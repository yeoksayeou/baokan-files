Xinhua News Agency report: A highly effective drug for expelling ascarids (roundworms) – "Piperazine" – has recently been successfully trial-produced by the Southwest Pharmaceutical Factory in Chongqing. This drug is highly effective in expelling worms, convenient to take, and has relatively low toxicity. The quality of the drug produced in this trial has been tested and meets the regulations.

This drug was successfully trial-produced under the research and guidance of Zheng Shou, the chief engineer of the Southwest Pharmaceutical Factory. In recent years, he has successively trial-produced drugs such as "Tetrachloroethylene" for treating hookworm disease and "Chloroguanide" for treating malaria. The state has now designated specialized pharmaceutical factories to manufacture these drugs in large quantities. From May to October this year, Zheng Shou synthesized tartrate containing "Piperazine" using alcohol, ammonia water, and chlorine gas.

    驱除蛔虫特效药
    据新华社讯　驱除蛔虫的特效药——“被迫拉尽”（PIPERAZINE），最近由重庆西南制药厂试制成功。这种药品驱虫效率很高，服用方便，毒性较轻。这次试制出的药品经过检验，质量合乎规定。
    这种药品是由西南制药厂总工程师郑寿研究、指导试制成功的。几年来，他曾先后试制成功治疗钩虫病的“四氯乙烯”和治疗疟疾的“圜氯胍”等药品。这些药品现在国家都已指定专门药厂大量制造。今年5月到10月郑寿又用酒精、錏水和氯气合成了含有“被迫拉尽”的酒石酸盐。
