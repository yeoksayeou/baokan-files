Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 21st: The major items of the reconstruction project of the state-owned Guangzhou Paper Mill, China's largest newsprint manufacturer, have been basically completed. In the newly built, massive third paper-making workshop, a newly installed, giant, automated high-speed newsprint paper machine has already been test-run. According to its design capacity, this high-speed paper machine can produce 450 meters of wide 3.99-meter newsprint per minute during normal production.

The Guangzhou Paper Mill began large-scale reconstruction as early as the beginning of 1954. The two added paper-making workshops have been fully completed. The second paper-making workshop was put into production before the completion of the third paper-making workshop. The expanded groundwood pulp workshop has replaced the original three bag-type groundwood pulp machines, which were technically backward, with eight semi-automatic chain-type groundwood pulp machines. Five of them have been put into production one after another. The two recovery boilers in the expanded cooking workshop have also been put into production. The thermal power plant, which is under construction, will have a power generation capacity of 11,000 kilowatts and is equipped with two medium-pressure boilers. After the completion of the entire construction project of this thermal power plant in the second quarter of next year, plus a small portion of electricity supplied from outside the plant, this paper mill will have sufficient electricity and steam to operate all the machinery and equipment in the groundwood pulp workshop and the three paper-making workshops that manufacture chemical pulp.

The construction projects of this paper mill also include a pulp bleaching workshop and a general step-down transformer substation used to regulate the power supply from outside the plant, which have also been completed or are about to be completed.

After the completion of the reconstruction of the Guangzhou Paper Mill, in addition to producing 72,000 tons of newsprint annually, it can also produce 13,000 tons of pulp board (semi-finished newsprint) to supply other paper mills.

The reconstruction project of the Guangzhou Paper Mill was designed by Chinese technicians under the guidance of Soviet experts. Some of the installed machinery and equipment came from the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and Finland, and some were manufactured in China.

    广州造纸厂主要改建工程完成
    新华社广州21日电　中国最大的新闻纸制造厂——国营广州造纸厂改建工程的主要项目已经基本完成。在新建成的巨大的第三造纸车间里，新安装的一台巨型的自动化的高速新闻纸造纸机已经进行试车。按照设计能力，这台高速造纸机正常生产的时候，每分钟可以制出阔幅三点九九公尺的长达四百五十公尺的新闻纸。
    广州造纸厂早在1954年初就开始进行大规模的改建。增加的两个造纸车间已经全部建成，第二造纸车间在第三造纸车间建成以前就投入了生产。扩大了的磨木车间，由八台半自动化的链式磨木机，代替原来技术较落后的三台袋式磨木机，它们中有五台先后投入了生产。扩大了的蒸煮车间的两个回收锅也已经投入生产。正在加紧建设的热电站，发电能力将达到一万一千瓩，并且配备有二台中压锅炉。到明年第二季度，这个热电站建设工程全部完成以后，加上厂外供应的小部分电力，这个造纸厂就有足够的电力和蒸汽，使制造化学纸浆的磨木车间和三个造纸车间的机器设备全部都开动起来。
    这个造纸厂的建设项目还包括有纸浆漂白车间及用来调节厂外供电的总降压变电所等，它们也都已经建成或快要建成。
    广州造纸厂改建完成以后，每年除了可以出产新闻纸七万二千吨以外，还可以出产纸浆板（新闻纸半成品）一万三千吨供应其他造纸厂。
    广州造纸厂的改建工程是中国技术人员在苏联专家指导下设计的，所安装的机器设备，一部分来自苏联、民主德国和芬兰，一部分是中国自己制造的。
