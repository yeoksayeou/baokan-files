Speech by Comrade Hu Ming, Vice Minister of Food Industry

I fully agree with the Central Committee's political report, the report on the revision of the Party Constitution, and the report on proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan. Now I would like to express some opinions on the food industry.

During the First Five-Year Plan, the food industry mainly relied on its existing foundation to increase production. After several years of effort, the products of this industrial sector have, to a certain extent, met social needs and accumulated construction funds for the country. During this period, some industries have also seen greater development, such as the capacity of machine-made sugar, which has nearly tripled in five years, thus fundamentally changing China's reliance on imports for sugar.

China is a country rich in resources. Agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and fisheries all provide abundant resources for the development of the food industry. Therefore, the development of the food industry should consider how to make full use of these resources. However, there are still many shortcomings in this regard:

  The food industry's resources have not been fully utilized.

First, the food industry is developing unevenly, and many resources are not being utilized. In recent years, we have focused more on the development of industries such as sugar and salt, and have not paid enough attention to the development of other food industries. For example, the utilization of fruit resources is very poor. In 1955, hundreds of thousands of kilograms of grapes from Dazeshan in Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong Province, rotted. The yield of wild grapes in Northeast China is very high, but the utilization rate is only about 10%. If some domestic grapes are developed in conjunction, high-quality wine can be brewed. South China is rich in pineapples, but the amount processed is still small. Fruit-producing areas also do not make good use of fallen fruit, second-grade fruit, and damaged fruit. The meat and dairy resources in the Northwest, Inner Mongolia, and Northeast China are abundant, but these areas lack modern processing equipment, resulting in a large amount of milk spoiling due to the inability to process it. These situations must be changed quickly.

Second, there is a lack of comprehensive utilization of raw material resources. Many raw materials are only half-utilized. For example, beet sugar residue is a good feed. The national annual output of residue is about one million tons, which, when mixed with other feeds, can feed about 50,000 cattle or one million sheep each year. However, these residues have not been fully utilized. One-third of the waste liquid from soap factories nationwide fails to extract glycerin, resulting in an annual loss of more than 3,000 tons of glycerin. Many vegetable oils do not extract phospholipids, which affects quality and wastes valuable by-products. Other items, such as eggshells from egg factories, by-products of salt, and scraps and peels from meat and fruit processing, have not been well utilized. This work should be actively strengthened in the future.

Third, efforts to conserve resources and use substitutes are also insufficient. For example, the production of edible vegetable oil cannot meet demand. However, the amount of edible vegetable oil used for manufacturing soap in China currently reaches 60,000 to 70,000 tons per year. If non-edible oils are developed as substitutes, or if petroleum by-product paraffin is used to make detergents, a large amount of edible oil can be saved. At present, about 65% of the raw materials used by alcohol factories nationwide are grains and tubers. If wood chips, sugarcane dregs, cottonseed hulls, and other waste materials are extracted by hydrolysis to produce alcohol, a large amount of grain can be saved for the country. In addition, we should strive to improve technology in the industrial production process, promote advanced experience, reduce consumption quotas, increase yields, and save raw materials.

Fourth, research on raw materials, especially the promotion of improved varieties, is not enough. Using the same agricultural raw materials and the same industrial equipment, promoting improved varieties can increase the output of industrial products, improve quality, and reduce costs. The improved sugarcane variety "Taiwan Sugar 134" in Guangdong yields 6.2 tons of sugarcane per mu, with a sugar content of more than 13%, and a total sugar content of 1,500 catties per mu; while local bamboo sugarcane only yields 2 tons per mu, with a sugar content of about 10%, and a total sugar content of only 400 catties per mu. The early-maturing improved variety "Java 3016" allows sugar factories to start crushing 20 days earlier while maintaining a certain sugar content. The sugar beet varieties in Northeast China have shown a tendency to degenerate in recent years. The sugar content of Jilin sugar beets has dropped from about 16% to 17% to about 12%. If efforts are made to improve varieties and achieve the same sugar content as Inner Mongolia, reaching 17% to 18%, tens of thousands of tons of sugar can be produced for the country each year. There are also some problems with the raw materials, varieties, and specifications of industries such as oils and fats, brewing, canned foods, and cigarettes, which must be solved. In order to strengthen the propagation and promotion of improved varieties, under the unified leadership and planning of the agricultural departments, the industrial departments also need to undertake certain agricultural experimental research tasks and try to run some demonstration farms.

      Two methods to improve the quality of food industry products

Based on the above situation, it can be seen that the development of China's food industry has good resource conditions. The problem lies in how to fully and rationally utilize these resources to meet the needs of the people. This requires efforts in two aspects:

First, improve the scientific and technological level of China's food industry. The processing objects of the food industry are mainly organic compound agricultural and livestock products, and the processing process is a relatively complex physical, chemical, and biochemical change process. Therefore, the food industry requires a certain level of science and technology. To this end, it is necessary to strengthen scientific research and the training of technical cadres; it is necessary to gradually reorganize and improve existing enterprises and carry out necessary technical improvements; and at the same time, build some new modern food factories, such as large-scale machine-made sugar factories, oil and fat chemical complexes, canned food factories, and hydrolysis factories.

Second, preserve and promote various famous foods with unique styles inherent in our country. China's inherent foods are rich and colorful, and are part of the motherland's precious historical heritage. For example, Beijing Quanjude roast duck, Liubiju pickles, Jinhua ham, Nanjing salted duck, the eight famous wines, Sichuan榨菜 (zhacai), Yunnan large-headed mustard greens, and various bean products are all nutritious and delicious foods made by using local specialty raw materials and special processing techniques. These foods enjoy a high reputation among the people. China's food cooking art includes smoking, roasting, pickling, braising, curing, roasting, marinating, frying, stir-frying, steaming, etc., which are also popular and make people "dismount at the scent." However, there are currently two problems with these foods: one is that the output of some famous products has declined, such as Nanjing salted duck. The highest annual output before the war was 2 million, but it has now dropped to hundreds of thousands. The second is that the quality of some famous products has declined, such as the quality of famous wines, hams, and pickles are not as good as in the past. In order to effectively preserve and promote China's inherent famous foods, we believe that the following measures must be taken: First, ensure the supply of raw materials. The decline in the output and quality of many famous products is largely due to the lack of guaranteed raw materials. For example, to make ham, it is necessary to select hind legs of pigs with thin skin, tender meat, more lean meat, and a leg weight of 8 to 11 catties; to make salted duck, it is necessary to select ducks weighing 2.5 catties with a breast meat thickness of more than 1 cm. Other raw materials used for various famous wines, pickles, etc. also have certain specifications. Therefore, ensuring the supply of raw materials in terms of quality and quantity is an important material condition for preserving and promoting these famous foods. Second, strictly implement the original process operation methods. Some comrades often do not study and summarize the production methods of various famous foods, blindly emphasize that they are ancient and backward, and easily change them. For example, the fermentation of Xinghua Village Fenjiu was shortened from 21 days to 18 days, and Maotai wine squeezed the tail end of the wine into the good wine in order to increase production. These practices are not right. In the future, the original process operation methods should be restored, and then the unscientific and unsanitary parts should be gradually removed through experiments and summaries, taking the essence and carrying it forward. In the future, we should attach importance to this work and regard it as an integral part of the entire food industry.

The food industry is closely related to people's lives, is highly localized, has a poor existing foundation, and its production management and technical level are still relatively backward. There are also many problems with the quality of products and the combination of production, supply, and sales. Therefore, the improvement and development of the food industry in the future not only requires the efforts of the Ministry of Food Industry, but more importantly, the efforts of local governments. It is hoped that all provinces and cities will consider the issues mentioned above when planning annual and long-term plans; and it is hoped that comrades in relevant departments will provide more guidance and support.

### 进一步提高和发展我国食品工业

    进一步提高和发展我国食品工业
    食品工业部副部长　胡明同志的发言
    我完全同意中央委员会的政治报告，关于修改党章的报告和关于第二个五年计划建议的报告。现在我想就食品工业方面的问题发表一些意见。
    在第一个五年计划期间，食品工业主要是依靠原有基础来提高生产的。经过几年的努力，这个工业部门的产品，在一定程度上满足社会需要，并为国家积累了建设资金。在这期间，某些行业也有了较大的发展，如机制糖五年内新增能力约为三倍，因而基本上改变了我国食糖依靠进口的情况。
    我国是一个物产丰富的国家。农业、畜牧业、林业、水产业等都为食品工业的发展提供了丰富的资源。因此，食品工业在发展中就应该考虑如何充分利用这些资源，但是目前在这方面还存在着许多缺点：
  食品工业的资源还没有充分利用
    第一、食品工业发展得不平衡，不少资源没有利用。几年来，我们比较着重了糖、盐等行业的发展，对其他食品工业的发展则注意不够。例如对水果资源的利用就很差。山东莱阳专区大泽山的葡萄，在一九五五年腐烂了几十万斤。东北的山葡萄产量很大，可是利用率仅有百分之十左右，如果配合发展一些家葡萄，就可以酿造上等葡萄酒。华南盛产菠萝，但目前加工的数量还很少。产果地区对落果、次果、伤害果的利用也很不够。西北、内蒙古、东北地区的肉、乳资源很丰富，但这些地区缺乏现代化的加工设备，以致大量的牛奶，因无法处理而酸败。这些情况必须很快地加以改变。
    第二、对原料资源缺乏综合的利用。好多原料，只利用了半截。如甜菜糖的废丝是很好的饲料，全国废丝年产量约一百多万吨，掺用其他饲料，每年就可喂牛约五万头或羊一百万只，可是这些废丝尚未全部利用。全国肥皂废液的三分之一未能提取甘油，每年损失的甘油达三千多吨。不少植物油不提出磷脂，既影响质量，又浪费了宝贵的副产品。其他如蛋厂的蛋壳、盐的副产品、肉类、水果加工中的下脚和果皮等，也都没有很好利用。今后应当积极加强这方面的工作。
    第三、对资源的节约和采用代替品也做得不够。例如食用植物油生产不能满足需要。但目前我国用于制造肥皂的食用植物油，每年达六至七万吨，如果发展非食用油等来代替，或用石油的副产品石腊制洗涤剂，就可以节省大量食油。目前全国酒精厂的原料大约有百分之六十五左右是用粮食和薯类，如果将木屑、甘蔗渣、棉籽壳等废料，用水解提取酒精，就可以为国家节省大量的粮食。此外，我们还应该在工业生产过程中努力改进技术，推广先进经验，以降低消耗定额，提高收得率，节约原料。
    第四、对原料的试验研究，特别是推广良种工作做得不够。同样的农业原料，同样的工业设备，推广良种就可以增加工业产品的产量，提高质量和降低成本。广东甘蔗的良种“台糖134”每亩产蔗六点二吨，含糖分百分之十三以上，每亩产蔗的总含糖量一千五百市斤；而当地的竹蔗每亩只产二吨，含糖分百分之十左右，每亩产蔗的总含糖量仅四百市斤。早熟良种“爪哇3016”在保持一定含糖分的条件下，糖厂可以提前开榨二十多天。东北的甜菜品种近年来有退化的趋向，吉林甜菜含糖率已从百分之十六至百分之十七下降到百分之十二左右，如果对改良品种下功夫，争取含糖分同内蒙古的一样达到百分之十七至百分之十八，这样，每年就可为国家增产几万吨糖。油脂、酿造、罐头食品、卷烟等工业的原料、品种、规格也都存在一些问题，必须设法解决。为了加强良种的繁殖推广工作，今后在农业部门的统一领导和规划下，工业部门也需要负担一定的农业试验研究工作的任务，并试办一些示范性的农场。
      提高食品工业产品质量的
              两项办法
    根据上述情况，可以看出，发展我国的食品工业，具备着良好的资源条件，问题是在于如何充分和合理地利用这些资源来满足人民的需要，这必须从两方面加以努力：
    第一、提高我国食品工业的科学技术水平。食品工业的加工对象，主要是有机化合物的农畜产品，加工过程是一个比较复杂的物理化学和生物化学的变化过程。因此，要求食品工业具有一定的科学技术水平。为此，就需要加强科学研究工作和技术干部的培养工作；需要对现有的企业，逐步加以整理提高，进行必要的技术改进；同时并新建一些现代化的食品工厂，如大型的机制糖厂、油脂化学联合工厂、罐头食品工厂、水解工厂等。
    第二、保存和发扬我国固有的独具风格的各种著名食品。我国固有的食品是丰富多采的，是祖国宝贵的历史遗产的一部分。如：北京全聚德的烤鸭、六必居的酱菜、金华火腿、南京板鸭、八大名酒、四川榨菜、云南大头菜以及各种豆制品等，都是利用各地特产的原料，经过特殊的工艺加工，所做出的营养丰富、滋味鲜美的食品。这些食品在人民中享有很高的声誉。我国食品的烹饪艺术有熏、烤、酱、卤、腊、烧、腌、炸、炒、蒸等，也是脍炙人口，使人“闻香下马”。但是这些食品目前存在两个问题：一是某些名产产量下降，如南京板鸭，战前最高年产量为二百万只，现已下降到几十万只。二是某些名产质量下降，如名酒、火腿、酱菜等质量都不如过去。为了有效地保存和发扬我国固有的著名食品，我们认为必须采取如下措施：首先，要求保证原料供应。许多名产产量和质量的下降，在很大程度上是由于原料没有保证。如做火腿就要挑选皮薄、肉嫩、精肉多，腿重八至十一斤的生猪后腿；做板鸭就要挑选重二斤半，胸脯肉厚一公分以上的鸭子，其他如各种名酒、酱菜等所用原料也都有一定的规格。因此，保证原料按质按量的供应，是保存和发扬这些著名食品的重要物质条件。第二、要严格执行原有的工艺操作方法。有些同志往往不去研究总结各种名产食品的生产方法，盲目强调说它古老落后，而轻易地加以改变。例如杏花村汾酒的发酵，从二十一天缩短到十八天，茅台酒为了增产曾把酒尾挤入好酒内。这些做法都是不对的。今后应该恢复原有的工艺操作方法，并通过试验、总结，然后才逐步去掉不够科学和卫生的部分，取其精华，加以发扬光大。今后我们应该重视这项工作，把它作为整个食品工业的组成部分。
    食品工业与人民生活密切相关，地方性较大，现有基础较差，生产管理和技术水平还相当落后，产品的质量和供产销的结合也存在很多问题。因此今后食品工业的提高和发展，不但需要食品工业部的努力，而且更重要的还需要地方的努力。希望各省市在规划年度和长远计划时，考虑到以上所提到的问题；并希望有关部门的同志多予指导和支持。
