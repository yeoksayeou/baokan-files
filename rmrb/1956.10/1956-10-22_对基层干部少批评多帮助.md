    More Help, Less Criticism for Grassroots Cadres
    Zhang Gongchuo, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Changning District Committee of the CPC in Shanghai

    Some leading organs criticize and blame grassroots cadres too much, while encouraging and helping them too little. Moreover, the methods of criticism are often simple and general, either saying "you are leftist" or "you are rightist," leaving grassroots cadres at a loss even after being criticized. Changning District in Shanghai is paying attention to changing this situation, which is worthy of attention.

    Currently, some grassroots cadres in joint state-private enterprises have some hesitation in their United Front work, fearing both losing their standpoint and damaging relationships, often feeling caught in the middle and unable to make up their minds.

    This hesitation arises from both subjective and objective reasons. However, examining it from the leadership's perspective, an important reason deserves attention, namely, many leading departments have for a long time criticized and blamed grassroots cadres too much, while encouraging and helping them too little. Moreover, the methods of criticism are often simple and general, either saying "you are leftist!" or "you are rightist!" But how to be neither leftist nor rightist lacks concrete analysis, so grassroots cadres remain at a loss even after being criticized.

    Speaking from the perspective of our Changning District Committee United Front Work Department, when we go to the grassroots to inspect work, we often focus on "finding faults" and "finding deviations," rarely discovering and summarizing the experiences of grassroots United Front work. In the entire year of 1955, our district committee only thoroughly summarized the experiences of grassroots United Front work once. Apart from that, whether in mobilization reports, summarizing work, or regular meetings to arrange and study work, grassroots cadres mostly heard various kinds of "either leftist or rightist" criticisms. Some criticisms are often inappropriate and cannot truly achieve the goal of improving work. Consider the following example: Last year, the district committee sent cadres to the private Yongxingye Dyeing and Weaving Factory (which was then an intermediate form of state capitalism, a processing factory) to inspect work. At that time, many comrades in the district committee (including some leading comrades), believed that grassroots cadres generally had right-leaning thoughts, i.e., they could not see class struggle and subjectively assumed that Yongxingye Dyeing and Weaving Factory would be no exception. Therefore, the comrades who inspected the work concluded after seizing upon some phenomena upon arriving at the factory that the factory's United Front work was "rightist." What was the basis? One basis was that the factory's branch secretary had feelings of arrogance and complacency and harbored paralyzed thinking. Another basis was that the capitalist of the factory said that the state's personnel had been very helpful to him; the capitalist sometimes ordered the workers according to the opinions of the personnel. It cannot be said that the factory's work had no shortcomings, but can the conclusion that the factory's United Front work was "right-leaning" be drawn from the above two points? Of course not. In fact, nothing unfavorable to the interests of the working class happened in this factory, and the factory's cadres even educated the capitalist on the issue of product quality. Therefore, it was a fact that the capitalist believed that the state's personnel were helpful to him. The comrades from the district committee who went to inspect the work confused the shortcomings in specific work with the principled issue of being "left" or "right," and unilaterally criticized the factory's cadres for making a "right-leaning" mistake, which was inappropriate. Because the leaders criticized them, the party branch secretary of this factory made a self-criticism at a cadre meeting. Although the self-criticism was done, this incident not only made the cadres of this factory feel unconvinced, but also confused the thinking of cadres in other factories. They said, "United Front work will be difficult to do in the future. If you're not careful, you'll be criticized. It's better to ask the higher authorities for instructions on everything." As a result, the initiative and enthusiasm of grassroots cadres were greatly weakened. Once, a party branch secretary of a factory called the district committee in the middle of the night to ask the district committee to make a decision on a matter that could have been resolved by himself. Some cadres from factories in the textile system came to the district committee for meetings, only reflecting the situation and not talking about their own views and opinions on the issues, hoping that the district committee would solve everything. The attitude of cadres not daring to take independent responsibility and relying on higher authorities for everything is a bad consequence caused by excessive and inappropriate criticism.

    The emergence of the phenomenon of excessive and inappropriate criticism shows that many of our leading comrades often see too much of the shortcomings and deviations of grassroots cadres in the implementation of policies, while failing to see their experiences and achievements. They think that criticizing lower-level cadres is "guiding the work," without asking whether this matter should be criticized, how it should be criticized, and what the effect of the criticism will be. It should be said that criticism is a method of conducting leadership, but it is not the only method. Being good at discovering and paying attention to the advantages and creations in the work of cadres, and being good at enlightening the self-awareness of cadres' work, is an even more important leadership method. Comrade Deng Xiaoping correctly pointed this out in the "Report on the Revision of the Party Constitution" made at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. In order to overcome this shortcoming in the relationship between the higher and lower levels of the Party, the new Party Constitution added the following provision: "The leading organs of the Party at all levels must constantly listen to the opinions of lower-level organizations and the masses of Party members, study their experiences, and promptly solve their problems." Obviously, such provisions are completely necessary. Recently, the leaders of our district committee have begun to change this leadership style of too much criticism and too little concrete help. For example, the United Front Work Department of the district committee recently adopted the method of holding forums to understand the situation, and summarized the working experiences of seven or eight factories with good state-private relations, including how to give play to the enthusiasm of private personnel and respect their powers. Regarding how to cooperate closely with private personnel and strengthen unity. After these experiences were approved and distributed by the district committee, they not only encouraged these factories, but also promoted the work of other joint state-private factories. United Front work in joint state-private enterprises is a new work for every comrade. The reason why many problems arise in the work is mainly because the cadres lack experience and political level. Since the "Five-Anti" campaign, cadres have developed a thought that "United Front work is difficult to do and easy to make principled mistakes." In view of the above situation, cadres should be given more encouragement and help. In United Front work, it is also necessary to advocate creating advanced experiences to overcome the fear of making mistakes. This approach of strengthening leadership from a positive perspective is beneficial to the development of United Front work.

    Let us be able to truly and effectively grasp the weapon of criticism and earnestly improve leadership work! This is the current urgent task.

### 对基层干部少批评多帮助

    对基层干部少批评多帮助
    中共上海长宁区委统战部副部长　张公绰
    有些领导机关对基层干部批评和指责过多，鼓励和帮助太少，而批评的方式很多是简单的，笼统的，不是说“你左了”，就是说“你右了”，以致使基层干部受到批评以后还是无所适从。上海长宁区注意改变这种情况，是值得重视的。
    目前有些公私合营企业的基层干部对统战工作有些缩手缩脚的情绪，既怕丧失立场，又怕搞坏关系，往往弄得左右为难，拿不定主意。
    这种缩手缩脚的情绪产生有主观原因也有客观原因。但从领导方面来检查，有一个重要原因是值得引起注意的，那就是有许多领导部门很长时期以来对基层干部批评和指责过多，鼓励和帮助过少，而批评的方式很多是简单的，笼统的，不是说“你左了！”就是说“你右了！”而怎样才是不左不右却缺少具体的分析，这样基层干部受到批评后仍旧是无所适从。
    我想从我们上海长宁区委统战部的情况来说，我们到基层去检查工作，往往从“找毛病”“找偏差”着眼，很少去发现和总结基层统战工作的经验。在1955年整整一年中，我们区委只比较深入地总结过一次基层统战工作的经验。除此之外，无论是在动员报告、总结工作、经常布置与研究工作的会议上，基层干部所听到的大多数是各种各样“非左即右”的批评。有些批评往往又是不中肯的，不能真正达到改进工作的目的。请看下面的例子：去年，区委曾派干部到私营永兴业染织厂（当时是国家资本主义中级形式的加工厂）去检查工作。当时区委有不少同志（包括一部分领导同志在内），认为基层干部比较普遍地存在着右倾思想，即看不到阶级斗争，主观地设想永兴业染织厂也不会例外，于是检查工作的同志一下厂抓住了一些现象就下结论，说这个厂的统战工作“右”了。根据是什么呢？一个根据是这个厂的支部书记有骄傲自满情绪，思想上存有麻痹思想。另一个根据是这个厂的资本家说国家派员对他很有帮助；资本家有时根据派员的意见去命令工人。不能说这个工厂的工作没有缺点，但能否就上面这两点得出这个工厂统战工作“右倾”的结论呢？当然不能。事实上，这个厂并没有发生什么不利于工人阶级利益的事情，而且在产品的质量问题上这个厂的干部还对资本家进行过教育，因此，资本家认为国家派员对他有帮助是事实。区委下去检查工作的同志把具体工作上的缺点，同“左”右倾的原则问题混淆起来，片面地批评这个厂的干部犯了“右倾”错误，是不妥当的。由于领导批评了他们，这个厂的党支部书记在一次干部会议上做了检讨，虽然检讨是做了，但这件事不但使这个厂的干部思想不通，而且使其他厂的干部思想也混乱起来。他们说：“今后统战工作难做了，一不好就挨批评，还是事事请示上级处理为妙。”这样一来，基层干部的工作主动性和积极性就大大削弱了。有一次，一个厂的党支部书记，为了请示一件原可由自己解决的事，半夜三更打电话给区委，要区委作主。纺织系统有些厂的干部到区委来开会，只反映情况，不谈自己对问题的看法和意见，一切都希望区委来解决。干部这种不敢独立负责，凡事依赖上级的态度正是批评过多、批评不中肯造成的恶果。
    批评过多和批评不中肯的现象的产生，说明我们不少领导同志往往过多地看到基层干部在执行政策中的缺点和偏差，而看不到他们的经验和成绩，他们以为批评下面干部，这就是“指导工作”，而不问这件事是否应该批评，应该如何批评，批评的效果如何。应该说，批评是进行领导的一种方法，但不是唯一的方法，善于发现和注意干部工作中的优点和创造，善于启发干部工作的自觉性，这更是一种重要的领导方法。邓小平同志在中国共产党第八次全国代表大会所作的“关于修改党的章程的报告”中正确地指出了这一点。为了克服党的上下级关系中的这个缺点，新的党章中增加了下列的规定：“党的各级领导机关必须经常听取下级组织和党员群众的意见，研究他们的经验，及时地解决他们的问题。”显然这样的规定是完全必要的。最近我们区委领导上已经着手来改变这种批评过多，具体帮助太少的领导作风。例如区委统战部最近采用开座谈会的方式了解情况，总结出七、八个公私关系搞得好的工厂的工作经验，其中包括如何发挥私方人员积极性，尊重他们职权的问题；关于如何和私方人员紧密合作，加强团结的问题。这些经验经区委批转发下去后，不但对这些厂是一种鼓励，而且对其他各公私合营厂的工作都有推动作用；公私合营企业中统战工作对每一个同志来说，是一项新的工作。其所以在工作中产生许多问题主要是因为干部经验不足，政治水平不高所致。“五反”以来，干部产生了一种认为“统战工作难搞，容易犯原则错误”的思想。针对以上情况，更应该给干部以鼓励和帮助。在统战工作上也应该提倡创造先进经验，用来克服怕犯错误的思想。这种从积极方面来加强领导的做法对统战工作的开展是有益的。
    让我们能够真正有效地掌握批评的武器，认真地改进领导工作吧！这是当前的迫切任务。
