    Taking Care of Small Boat Safety
    We recently traveled from Wanxian, Sichuan, to Yunyang by wooden boat, and in Yunyang, we transferred to a five-and-a-half-ton wooden boat. The boat entered the Chaokou rapids in the Bay River, where the water was swift and the wind was strong. Everyone was congratulating themselves on a smooth journey along the way (because they had not yielded to steamships). Unexpectedly, the Wujiang steamship, carrying four barges at full speed, came rushing downstream. It did not sound its whistle, making it impossible for the small boat to avoid it in an extremely dangerous situation. One after another, giant waves about six or seven feet high crashed fiercely onto the small boat. All the men, women, old, and young on the boat cried out to the heavens, terrified, and turned pale. At this moment of life and death, the captain repeatedly ordered calm, and with everyone's efforts and the proper handling by the sailors, a major loss was avoided.
    Of course, according to the rules, wooden boats should give way to steamships. However, the Wujiang steamship deliberately did not sound its whistle in the Bay River rapids, and the wooden boat unknowingly entered the Chaokou rapids. If it were still required to yield according to the rules, the wooden boat would inevitably be pushed onto the rocks. We heard boatmen reflect that some steamships on the Yangtze River often disregard the safety of wooden boats, especially small wooden boats, during navigation. Therefore, we hope that the Yangtze River Navigation Administration will earnestly educate steamship captains to avoid the recurrence of such incidents. Nián Xiáfū

    照顾小船安全
    我们最近从四川万县乘木船去云阳，在云阳转乘一只五吨半的木船。船在湾河水急风又大的情况下，进入了潮口急流。大家正庆幸沿途一帆风顺（因没有避让轮船），出乎意料，乌江轮船大加马力载有四个驳子，由下飞驰而来。它也不鸣气笛，致使这支小船在极端危险的情况下，无法避让。一个个约六、七尺高的巨浪，凶猛地向这支小船扑来。全船的男女老少喊天叫地，心惊胆寒，面色青白。在这生死存亡的时候，驾长再三命令镇静，在大家的维护下，和水手掌握得当，才没有造成大的损失。
    固然，照常规是木船让轮船的，乌江轮在湾河急流之下有意不鸣气笛，而木船无知进入了潮口急流，如果也要照常规来让，势必要将木船推上石头上去。我们听船工们反映，长江的某些轮船，在航行中只顾自己不顾木船，特别是小木船的安全还是经常发生。因此，希望长江航运管理局认真教育轮船驾长，避免再发生类此事件。　年侠夫
