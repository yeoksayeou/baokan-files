    Soviet New Technologies
    Drilling with Explosives
    It takes a lot of time to install drill pipes when drilling oil wells. For example, in hard rock at a depth of one thousand meters, the drill bit wears out after working for one and a half hours and advancing a little more than one meter. To replace the drill bit, the drill pipe, which is one thousand meters long, has to be lifted to the surface and then lowered again.
    Soviet scientists at the All-Union Drilling Research Institute have developed a new method of drilling using explosives. The method is as follows: a metered amount of explosive is sent through the drill pipe at intervals. After the explosive exits the drilling tool, it detonates to deepen the wellbore. The crushed rock is then drawn to the surface by a pressure pump through flushing fluid. When drilling hard rock with explosives, sixteen meters can be drilled per hour, while with a drill bit, only one or two meters can be drilled per hour. In addition, when drilling rock with a drill bit, the rock is mostly ground into powder, while with explosives, the rock is broken into small pieces, which provides rich material for studying the geological profile of oil-producing areas.
    Currently, the new method has been adopted in the Kuibyshev oil region, and it is planned to drill oil wells with a total depth of ten thousand meters this year. According to the lowest estimate, the new method can increase the amount of drilling per run by nine to fourteen times.
    Generating Electricity with Small Rivers
    Recently, a Moscow resident, Rodin, designed a simple small-scale hydroelectric power station without dams or factory buildings. It is suitable for small rivers, and it is very convenient to build. A collective farm or a small industrial enterprise can build it themselves. This type of hydroelectric power station is sufficient to light up a collective farm or a small town.
    Currently, many collective farms in the Soviet Union use small rivers to generate electricity. For example, the "Dawn" collective farm in the Novo-Torzhsky district of the Kalinin region is close to a small river called the Taronka. This river is very narrow, and people can jump across it in some places. The average depth is only fifty centimeters. The "Dawn" collective farm built three hydroelectric power stations on this river between 1946 and 1948. The first hydroelectric power station has a generating capacity of fourteen kilowatts, which can supply electricity to four hundred light bulbs and the radio stations and radio networks in all nine villages of the collective farm. In addition, it can also supply electricity for many agricultural operations. This hydroelectric power station brings an income of 30,000 rubles to the collective farm every year. The second and third hydroelectric power stations each have a generating capacity of eight kilowatts, and each hydroelectric power station can increase the collective farm's income by 20,000 rubles per year.
    Overhead Cableway on the Volga River
    On the right bank of the Volga River, facing the buildings of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station under construction, are many small hills piled with sand, gravel, and crushed stone, which are mixing materials for construction projects. As the construction and installation projects on the construction site expand, the demand for raw materials by concrete factories also increases. To transport these mixing materials, a huge overhead cableway was built across the Volga River. The overhead cableway has already transported a lot of construction materials.
    This overhead cableway has eight transportation lines, which are composed of four independent double-line main lines. These main lines can be used together or separately according to the construction site's need for materials. This overhead cableway can transport one thousand tons of construction materials per hour.
    Everyone who passes by here in a boat looks at the 132-meter-high iron frames standing on both sides of the Volga River, admiring the huge aerial bridge that passes over the entire river. This huge steel bridge is composed of countless steel cables, steel ropes, steel frames, steel nets, winches, and other parts, with a total weight of two thousand one hundred and thirty tons, erected on two iron frames. The operation of these eight lines is managed by a dispatcher with the help of a powerful dispatch station. The loading and unloading of construction materials are also automated. The preliminary results of using the overhead cableway have already yielded great benefits, replacing at least fifteen trains of transportation every day.
    Building a Large House in Sixty-Four Days
    In Berezniki, the chemical industrial center in the northern Urals, simple and beautiful houses assembled with prefabricated components are increasing day by day. Under the command of the construction team leader, the crane delivers large concrete wall panels, and while the crane is transporting the prefabricated components behind, the welders have already assembled the components in front. Berezniki is the first city in the Soviet Union to produce and use porous large wall panels to build houses. A construction team consisting of ten assemblers, four welders, and two crane operators recently built three houses, each with sixty-eight apartments, in the city using this material, taking only sixty-four days.

    苏联新技术
    用爆炸法钻井
    在钻探油井上安放钻管要花费很多时间。例如，在一千公尺深处的硬岩石上，钻头工作一个半小时前进一公尺多就磨坏了。为了更换钻头就要把长达一千公尺的钻管提到地面上来然后再放下去。
    全苏钻探科学研究所的苏联科学家研究出了利用爆炸钻井的新方法。方法是这样：每隔一定的时间往钻管输送定量炸药，炸药从钻探工具出来以后就以爆炸加深井筒深度；被粉碎的岩石则通过冲洗液由压力唧筒抽升到地面上来。用爆炸方法钻硬的岩石时，每小时可钻进十六公尺，而用钻头每小时只能钻进一、二公尺。此外，在用钻头钻岩石时，岩石多被磨成碎沫，用爆炸法岩石被碎成小块，这样就为研究石油产地的地质断面提供了丰富的材料。
    目前，古比雪夫石油区已采用了这个新方法，今年计划要钻探总深度达一万公尺的油井。按最低的估计，新方法可以使每一次钻程量加大九倍到十四倍。
    利用小河发电
    最近，一位莫斯科人罗金设计了一种不带堤坝和厂房的简便小型水电站，它适用于小的河流，而且建设起来非常方便，一个集体农庄或一个小的工业企业自己就能办得到。这种水电站足能照明一个集体农庄或一个小镇。
    目前苏联有很多集体农庄利用小河发电。例如：加里宁州新托尔日斯基区的“曙光”集体农庄靠近一条名叫塔罗仁卡的小河，这条河很窄，有的地方人都可以跳过去，平均深度才五十公分。“曙光”集体农庄在1946—1948年间就在这条河上修了三个水电站。第一个水电站的发电能力是十四瓩，可以供四百盏电灯和农庄里所有九个村的无线电分站和无线电网用的电。此外它还可以供给很多农业操作用电。这个水电站每年给农庄带来三万卢布的收入。第二和第三个水电站的发电能力都是八瓩，每个水电站每年能给农庄增加两万卢布收入。
    伏尔加河上的架空索道
    在伏尔加河右岸，对着正在建设的斯大林格勒水电站的建筑物，高耸着许多堆着砂子、鹅卵石和碎石的小山，这是建筑工程用的搀合材料。随着工地上的建筑安装工程的扩大，混凝土工厂所需要的原料也增多了。为了运输这些搀合材料，横过伏尔加河修了一个巨大的架空索道。现在架空索道已经运输了很多建筑材料。
    这条架空索道有八条运输线路，是由四条独立的双线干线组成的。这些干线能够根据建筑工地对材料的需要可以一同使用，也可以单独使用。这个架空索道每小时可以运输一千吨的建筑材料。
    每一个坐船经过这里的人都注视着立在伏尔加河两岸的132公尺高的铁架子，欣赏着经过整个河上的巨大的空中桥梁。这座巨大的钢桥是由无数的钢缆、钢索、钢架、钢网、卷扬机和其他零件组成的，总共有两千一百三十吨重，架在两个铁架子上面。这八条线路的操作过程都是由一个调度员借助一个强大的调度站来管理。建筑材料的装卸也都是自动化的。利用架空索道的初步成绩已经取得了很大的利益，每天可以至少代替十五列火车的运输。
    六十四天盖起大房子
    在乌拉尔北部的化学工业中心别列兹尼奇，用预装构件装配的朴素美丽的住宅一天比一天多起来。起重机在建筑队长的指挥下，把混凝土的大墙板送来，当起重机运送后面的预装构件时，电焊工已经把前面的构件装配起来了。别列兹尼奇在苏联是第一个生产和采用多孔的大墙板建筑房屋的城市。由十个装配工、四个电焊工和两个起重机工组成的建筑队，最近在市内用这种材料盖了三座房子，每座六十八套间，只花六十四天功夫。
