Xinhua News Agency, October 2nd: Indian Ambassador to China, R.K. Nehru, hosted a banquet at noon today to welcome the Indian Republic Parliamentary Delegation headed by Speaker of the Indian People's Assembly, M. Ananthasayanam Ayyangar.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai were invited to attend the banquet.

Ambassador R.K. Nehru, in his speech at the beginning of the banquet, said that today's banquet was to welcome an important delegation from India, a delegation that brought the congratulations and enthusiasm of the Indian people, and the message of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly proposed by our two countries.

The Ambassador said that the spirit of the Five Principles is not only for countries with different social and political systems to coexist peacefully and compete peacefully, but more importantly, there should be peaceful cooperation. He raised his glass to the friendly cooperation between China and India and to world peace.

The head of the Indian Parliamentary Delegation, Ayyangar, in his speech, thanked the Ambassador for hosting the banquet for the delegation. He said that yesterday, the delegation participated in the National Day celebration of the People's Republic of China, and saw not only the parade, but also the enthusiasm and organizational abilities of the people. Although it rained heavily, the people's will overcame nature.

Ayyangar also said that today is the anniversary of the birth of the Father of India, Gandhi. Under Gandhi's leadership, India won independence and freedom from a powerful imperialism.

He said that Gandhi taught us to take the path of peaceful coexistence, and his teachings have remained to this day, "This is 'Panchsheel'." May all countries in the world be able to coexist peacefully, and not have large fish eat small fish and compete with each other. He wished the spirit of the Five Principles would develop more and more, and that China would become prosperous and strong.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi, in his speech at the banquet, said that despite the barriers of the Himalayas and the Indian Ocean, China and India have maintained friendly exchanges and cultural exchanges for two thousand years, allowing our country to absorb many valuable things from India, enriching our philosophy, literature, and art.

Chairman Liu said that now we need to carry out more and broader friendly exchanges and economic and cultural exchanges, because both of our countries are countries that have been liberated not long ago, and are countries that urgently need construction. We need to exchange experiences in all aspects, and need to support each other and enrich our construction strength.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi finally proposed a toast to the close cooperation between the parliaments of China and India, to the deep friendship between the people of China and India, and to the immortal spirit of Gandhi, who led India against imperialism.

Premier Zhou Enlai said in his speech at the banquet that today is the anniversary of Gandhi's birth. Gandhi relied on the Indian people throughout his life, and worked hard to achieve India's independence.

He said that the Chinese people are building their own country, and we should learn from Gandhi's spirit of self-reliance and hard work.

Also invited to attend the Indian Ambassador's banquet were Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, and Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi, Zhang Bojun and Burhan, Vice-Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Ding Xilin, President of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, and others. The Indian Military Friendship Delegation currently visiting China also attended the banquet.

    印度大使欢宴印度国会代表团
    新华社2日讯　印度驻中国大使拉·库·尼赫鲁在今天中午举行宴会，欢迎以印度人民院议长阿延加尔为首的印度共和国国会代表团。
    刘少奇委员长和周恩来总理应邀出席了宴会。
    拉·库·尼赫鲁大使在宴会开始时致词说，今天的宴会是为了欢迎来自印度的一个重要的代表团，这个代表团带来了印度人民的祝贺和热情，带来了我们两国共同提出的五项原则的信息。
    这位大使说，五项原则的精神不仅是社会、政治制度不同的国家和平共处及和平竞赛，更重要的是应当有和平合作。他举杯祝中印两国的友好合作，祝世界和平。
    印度国会代表团团长阿延加尔致词时，感谢大使为代表团所举行的宴会。他说，昨天，代表团参加了中华人民共和国国庆典礼，不仅看到了游行，而且看到了人民的热情和组织能力，虽然天下大雨，但是人民的意志力战胜了自然。
    阿延加尔又说，今天是印度国父甘地的诞辰纪念日，在甘地的领导下，印度从一个强大的帝国主义手中争取到了独立和自由。
    他说，甘地教导我们走和平共处的道路，他的教导一直存留到现在，“这就是‘潘查希拉’”。愿世界各国都能和平共处，而不要大鱼吃小鱼，彼此相争。他祝五项原则的精神愈来愈发展，祝中国繁荣富强。
    刘少奇委员长在宴会上致词说，尽管有着喜马拉雅山和印度洋的阻隔，中印两国二千年来一直进行着友好往来和文化交流，使我国从印度方面吸收了许多宝贵的东西，丰富了我们的哲学文学和艺术。
    刘委员长说，现在我们有需要更多更广地进行友好往来和经济文化交流，因为我们两国都是解放不久的国家，都是急待建设的国家，需要交流各方面经验，需要互相支援，充实自己的建设力量。
    刘少奇委员长最后提议为中印两国议会的密切合作，为中印两国人民的深厚友谊，为纪念领导印度反对帝国主义的甘地的不朽精神而干杯。
    周恩来总理在宴会上讲话说，今天正是甘地的诞辰纪念日，甘地一生依靠印度人民，同时艰苦奋斗，才求得印度的独立。
    他说，中国人民正在建设自己的国家，我们应该学习甘地依靠自己、艰苦奋斗的精神。
