Xinhua News Agency, 16th: According to a TASS reporter from Peace Village in Antarctica: Spring is in full swing in the Antarctic Circle, and the cold air is filled with the sound of birdsong. Light blue and white petrels have flown from the distant north to the islands near the Antarctic continent. Icebergs at sea are the habitat of thousands of penguins, and fierce Northern gulls have appeared on the ice floes here. The Antarctic gull (one of the most numerous and common birds in Antarctica) has returned and reoccupied the nests built on steep Haswell Island. In the Weddell Sea, hundreds of shiny seals crawl onto the ice floes to bask in the sun.

Now, the Antarctic region has more than fifteen hours of daylight, and the weather is clear. In this Antarctic spring in mid-October, the Soviet Antarctic research base, Peace Village, appears particularly active. The roar of machinery continues all day long. The various scientific teams of the expedition are constantly making observations, and have recently collected many interesting materials. A group of geographers investigated the ice dam northwest of Truth Coast to determine the nature and location of the icebergs.

From April to September, Peace Village experienced one hundred and fifty days of storms. On the first day of spring in September, cold glacial winds swept in at a speed of fifteen to seventeen meters per second. However, the wind is not as strong as in winter, and the duration of the storms has been greatly shortened. For half a year, the observatory's solid buildings have successfully withstood these storms. The storms brought a large amount of snow to the coastal areas of the central mainland, covering the village with a layer of snow three to four meters thick, and a large part of the coastal base's buildings were buried under the snow.

Since early spring, there have been signs that the snow in the observatory area will soon melt into water in large quantities. This water will penetrate into the bottom layer of snow and freeze into ice, and the equipment left outdoors may be very firmly frozen in the ice. The danger to the buildings themselves is also not small. Due to the large amount of snow melting, if rescue is not carried out in time, the buildings may be submerged. Therefore, for a period of almost two weeks, in addition to expanding scientific investigations, Peace Village's main slogan now is to fight the snow. Powerful "O-80 type" tractors and automatic snow shovels cut through the snowdrifts all the way to the bottom layer of ice formed in the autumn, where many ditches will be dug to drain the meltwater. These measures have eliminated the direct threat to housing and office buildings, and at the same time rescued equipment and food from under the snow. They have now been placed in a safe place.

### 春到南极  鸟儿歌声在荡漾　海豹冰上晒太阳

    春到南极
    鸟儿歌声在荡漾　海豹冰上晒太阳
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社记者从南极州和平村报道：南极圈的春意正浓，冷空气里荡漾着鸟儿的歌声。浅蓝色的和白色的海燕已从遥远的北方飞到临近南极大陆的岛上。海上的冰山是成千上万的企鹅的栖息地，这里的冰块上出现了凶猛的北海海鸥。南极的海鸥（南极海最多和最普遍的飞鸟中的一种）飞回来了，重新占据了筑在陡峭的哈斯韦耳岛上的巢穴。威德尔海成百头发亮的海豹爬上冰块曝晒太阳。
    现在，南极区的白昼长达十五小时以上，而且天气晴朗。在这个十月中旬的南极春天里，苏联南极考察基地——和平村显得分外活跃。机器的轰隆声整日响个不停。考察队各科学队不断进行观测，最近收集了许多有趣的材料。一批地理学家考察了真理海岸西北方的冰堤，就便查明了冰山的性质和位置。
    从4月到9月，和平村刮了一百五十天的暴风。在九月间春季来临的第一天，寒冷的冰河风以每秒十五公尺到十七公尺的速度袭来。但是，风力已经不像冬季那样强了，暴风的延续时间也大大缩短了。半年来，观象台坚固的建筑物胜利地经受住了这些暴风的袭击。暴风给大路中部各地区的沿岸带来大量的雪，给村子披上一层厚达三到四公尺的积雪，沿岸基地很大一部分的建筑被掩没在雪下。
    初春以来就有迹象表明，不久以后观象台区域里的积雪将大量融化成水。这些水渗透到积雪的底层就会结成冰，而留在屋外露天的器材就可能非常坚固地冻在冰里。对于建筑物本身的危险也不小。由于积雪大量融化，如果不及时抢救，建筑物就可能被淹没。因此，在为期几乎已达两星期的日子里，除了扩大科学调查以外，和平村现在主要的口号是同积雪作斗争。强力的“○—八十型”的拖拉机和自动冰铲把雪堆一直切穿到秋天时结成的冰层的底层，在那里将挖开许多沟渠以排泄雪融化后的积水。这些措施排除了住房和办公楼遭到的直接威胁，同时从雪底下救出了器材和食品。它们现在已经被安放在安全的地方了。
