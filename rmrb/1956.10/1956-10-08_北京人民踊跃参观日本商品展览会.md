Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch. More than 80,000 people in Beijing braved the rain today to visit the Japanese Commodity Exhibition, which opened yesterday.

As early as a little after four o'clock in the morning, people arrived outside the exhibition hall to wait for admission. Around six o'clock, a chilly autumn rain began to fall, but people continued to arrive in a steady stream from all over Beijing's urban and suburban areas.

At nine o'clock in the morning, visitors entered the exhibition hall. Among the visitors were workers, farmers, engineers, teachers, students, doctors, scientists, children, and housewives. They were very interested in the exhibition. Although it was raining in the afternoon, an average of 120 to 130 people still entered the exhibition hall every minute.

Printing workers Xu Guobin, Zhang Xingjiu, and Zhang Jinshan heard on the radio yesterday that there was an automatic typesetting machine among the exhibits, so they came together today to visit. Tang Xulin, a member of the Dongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Changping District, carefully examined the agricultural machinery in the West Square. In the West Hall, in front of the exhibit stand of the Kokushima Co., Ltd., a female teacher from Beijing No. 28 Middle School was carefully sketching the pattern on a pair of gloves in her notebook. The children's toy exhibit stand was crowded with children and their parents.

Kataoka Takashi, the deputy head of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition Group, told Xinhua News Agency reporters this afternoon that the enthusiastic attendance of visitors braving the rain on the first day after the opening showed that Chinese friends are very concerned about the Japanese Commodity Exhibition. We feel even more strongly that this exhibition bears a great responsibility in developing the friendship between the people of Japan and China.

    北京人民踊跃参观日本商品展览会
    据新华社7日讯　北京市今天有八万多人冒雨参观了在昨天开幕的日本商品展览会。
    清晨四点多钟，就有人来到展览会门外等候参观。六时许，就开始下起凉气袭人的秋雨，而从北京城郊各地前来参观的人仍然络绎不绝。
    上午九时，参观的人进入展览会大门。参观的人中间有工人、农民、工程师、教师、学生、医生、科学工作者、少年儿童和家庭主妇。他们对这个展览会感到很大的兴趣。下午虽然落雨，但平均每分钟仍有一百二、三十个人进入展览馆。
    印刷工人徐国斌、张兴久和张进善，昨天在广播中听说展品中有一台自动排铸机，今天就结伴一起来参观。昌平区东光农业合作社社员唐绪林在西广场仔细观看农业机械。西大厅里，在国岛株式会社的展品台前，北京市第二十八中学的一位女教员在笔记本上，细心描着一双手套上的图案。儿童玩具展品台的周围挤满了孩子和他们的父母。
    日本商品展览团副团长片冈峻今天下午对新华社记者说，开幕后的第一天，观众就这样踊跃冒雨参观，这表现了中国朋友很关心日本商品展览会。我们更加感到这次展览会在发展日中两国人民友谊上负着很大的任务。
