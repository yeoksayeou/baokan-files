Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 13th. The story of how Soviet, Swedish, and Norwegian scientists were trapped on an Arctic ice hummock for fourteen days and ultimately rescued by Soviet pilots is currently circulating widely throughout the Soviet Union. The Swedish government has also expressed its gratitude to the Soviet Embassy in Sweden for this matter.

On September 7th, a helicopter transported a group of Soviet, Swedish, and Norwegian scientists from the diesel-electric ship "Ob" anchored in the Arctic Spitsbergen archipelago to an ice hummock 700 meters above sea level on the "Northeast Land" archipelago, located fifty to sixty kilometers from the starting point. The purpose was to study the ice flow patterns in the area in preparation for the upcoming International Geophysical Year. They anticipated an observation period of two days.

However, the nearby sea, mountains, and ice floes made the weather in this area extremely unpredictable. In less than two days, the climate suddenly deteriorated. From the 9th to the 11th, numerous helicopters dispatched to pick up the scientists were unable to land. Soviet Arctic pilots had no choice but to decide to select an intermediate station near the ice hummock, where the helicopters would wait for the weather to improve. Unexpectedly, when the helicopter found a flat area to land, it discovered that the selected location was actually a lake covered with a thin layer of ice and snow. As soon as the aircraft touched the ice surface, it began to sink, the propeller hit a rock and broke, and the engine was damaged. The crew barely escaped and had to return to the "Ob" in a small boat.

On September 12th, the famous pilot Perov flew a helicopter to deliver food, clothing, and sleeping bags to the scientists. He discovered a place on the ice hummock where an aircraft equipped with ski landing gear could land.

On September 15th, the renowned Arctic pilot Moskalyenko, piloting a "Li-2" aircraft with wheels replaced by skis, set off on a rescue mission. The plane flew over the ice hummock several times, but it was constantly shrouded in thick fog, making landing impossible. Therefore, the Soviet pilots decided to adopt a continuous reconnaissance approach, with planes taking turns flying and monitoring the ice hummock.

It wasn't until the afternoon of September 21st that the ice hummock emerged from the clouds and mist. The aircraft on duty immediately notified the plane with the ski landing gear. However, in an instant, dark clouds gathered again, and when the aircraft flew over the ice hummock, it was almost invisible. Despite this, Moskalyenko displayed exceptional courage and skill, landing safely, loading all the scientists onto the aircraft, skillfully maneuvering the plane out of the deep snow, and flying to the nearby Nagursky Arctic station.

The scientists are now returning to the "Ob" to continue their work. During the two weeks they were trapped on the ice hummock, they continuously conducted scientific work and are satisfied with the results of their efforts.

### 北极冰丘上的友情  苏联飞行员勇敢救出被困在冰雪上的科学家

    北极冰丘上的友情
    苏联飞行员勇敢救出被困在冰雪上的科学家
    新华社莫斯科13日电　苏联、瑞典和挪威科学家在北极冰丘上被困十四天，最后终究为苏联飞行员救出的事迹，目前在苏联各地流传一时。瑞典政府还为这事向苏联驻瑞典大使馆表示了谢意。
    9月7日，一架直升飞机把一批苏联、瑞典、挪威科学家从停泊在北极斯匹次卑尔根群岛的“鄂毕号”柴油电动船上，送到了离起点五、六十公里的“东北地”群岛一个拔海七百公尺的冰丘上，去研究这个地区的冰的流动情形，为即将到来的国际地球物理学年作准备工作。他们预计考察时间是两天。
    但是，冰丘邻近的海、山和浮冰使这个地区的天气变化无常。不到两天工夫，气候突然变坏了。从9日到11日，一连派去接科学家的许多直升飞机都没有能够着陆。苏联的北极飞行员只好决定在冰丘附近选择一个中间站，直升飞机在那里等待气候好转。谁知当直升飞机找到了一块平坦的地方降落的时候，发现这选定的地方原来是一个结了一层薄冰和堆着积雪的湖泊。飞机一着冰面就开始陷落，螺旋桨碰到石头折断了，机器也坏了。机上人员仅以身免，只得乘小艇回到了“鄂毕号”。
    9月12日，著名驾驶员佩罗夫驾了一架直升飞机给科学家们投递粮食、衣服和睡袋。他发现冰丘上有一块地方可以降落装有滑雪履的飞机。
    9月15日，著名北极飞行员莫斯卡连科就驾驶一架“里——二”式飞机把轮子换成了滑雪履，出发前往营救。飞机好几次飞到冰丘上空，然而，冰丘上一直浓雾密盖，不能降落。于是苏联飞行员便决定采取不断侦察的办法，飞机轮番飞行，注视冰丘。
    直到9月21日下午，冰丘才从云雾中显现出来。轮班飞行的飞机立刻通知带着滑雪履的飞机。但是，转瞬间，又阴云四合，当这架飞机飞到冰丘上空的时候，冰丘又几乎看不见了。尽管这样，莫斯卡连科表现了高度的勇敢和技巧，平安地着了陆，把全部科学家载上了飞机，巧妙地使飞机离开了深深的积雪，飞到了附近纳古斯基北极站。
    科学家们现在又要回到“鄂毕号”去继续工作。他们被困在冰丘上的两个星期中，不间断地进行科学工作，对自己的工作结果感到满意。
