    The Vigilance of an Ordinary Citizen

    One evening in late September, Li Yijiu, a member of the Guangzhou Tenth Bamboo Handicraft Production Cooperative, was suddenly visited by a relative from Hong Kong, Mai Nuan, his wife's brother, whom he had not seen for several years.

    That evening, Li Yijiu went to see a play, and his wife, Mai Xingkuan, received her brother and let him stay.

    The next day, Mai Xingkuan said to Li Yijiu, "I took my brother's Hong Kong ID card and registered his residence. The ID card says his name is 'Mai Zhong'." Li Yijiu felt something was wrong. He thought: His original name was "Mai Nuan," why did he change it? He chatted with Mai Zhong. Mai Zhong said that the glass factory where he worked in Hong Kong had stopped production, so he came to visit his sister and brother-in-law. Li Yijiu saw that he had brought a lot of cooking oil, noodles, squid, rock candy, etc., from Hong Kong, and he also had a new suitcase, which looked quite rich, not like he was unemployed. Li Yijiu suspected that he was engaged in smuggling.

    After two days, Li Yijiu felt that Mai Zhong was even more strange. Every day, Mai Zhong slept until about ten in the morning before getting up, and he didn't go out all day, hiding in the house. Li Yijiu asked him, "Why do you sleep so late before getting up? Why don't you go out and see the construction situation in Guangzhou?" Mai Zhong replied vaguely, "In Hong Kong, I always sleep so late before getting up. There is nothing to see outside." Li Yijiu thought: Even if you are engaged in smuggling, you don't need to hide all day. He remembered that Mai Zhong had been a bandit in the countryside before liberation, and had also worked in the Kuomintang county party headquarters. Li Yijiu became suspicious of Mai Zhong.

    On the morning of the fourth day after Mai Zhong arrived in Guangzhou, Li Yijiu was making bamboo crafts at the door when he suddenly saw a person passing by the side of his house in a sneaky manner. They glanced at each other, and Li Yijiu recognized him as Wu Man'an, but Wu Man'an hurriedly dodged away without even saying hello. Li Yijiu thought: Wu Man'an lives in Hong Kong, when did he arrive in Guangzhou? Why didn't he come in and sit for a while? Another question arose in his mind. Two days later, at noon, Li Yijiu was splitting bamboo when he suddenly caught sight of Wu Man'an walking over. As soon as he saw Li Yijiu, he hid behind the wall. This further aroused Li Yijiu's suspicion and vigilance.

    At noon on September 29, a middle-aged man whom Li Yijiu had never seen before suddenly came to his house and asked as soon as he entered, "Is this Mai Xingkuan's home?"

    Mai Xingkuan felt very strange and asked him, "Where are you from, who are you looking for?"

    The middle-aged man said, "I am Mai Xingkuan's fellow villager, I want to find her."

    While Li Yijiu and his wife were suspecting this "uninvited guest," Mai Zhong hurriedly came down from the attic and said repeatedly, "Hey! Hey!" He hurriedly led the middle-aged man out the back door. Soon, Mai Zhong came in with a bamboo basket, which contained some bananas, star fruit, and a package wrapped in newspaper. Li Yijiu knew that there must be something fishy. He immediately went to the public security police station to report the situation.

    Based on Li Yijiu's report and the materials they had previously gathered, the public security organs, after urgent and strict investigation, promptly arrested Mai Zhong according to law. At the same time, public security personnel found an American-made time bomb hidden in the wooden pillow where Mai Zhong slept.

    In the interrogation room, the secret agent Mai Zhong stubbornly refused to confess, but in the face of conclusive evidence and after education by the public security personnel, Mai Zhong confessed to his accomplice, Wu Man'an. Based on the information they had and the clues reported by Li Yijiu, the public security organs quickly arrested the secret agent Wu Man'an according to law and seized an American-made time bomb. In addition, based on Wu Man'an's confession, they also arrested Li Jieping (female), a secret agent codenamed Miss Xu, who was dispatched by the Hong Kong Kuomintang secret service to Guangzhou to contact Mai and Wu.

    According to the confessions of Mai and Wu, they were both secret agents belonging to the "Intelligence Bureau" of the Kuomintang. They had received special training in Hong Kong on how to plant time bombs. As early as July, the Hong Kong Kuomintang secret service began to plan a large-scale explosion and sabotage conspiracy in Guangzhou on October 10. Before they were sent to Guangzhou, the head of the Hong Kong Kuomintang secret service designated their targets for the explosion. After they arrived in Guangzhou, they investigated the explosion targets—Changdi Cinema, Guangzhou Restaurant, and the Guangzhou-Foshan Railway Station. However, just as they felt that the masses' work of preventing traitors and counter-espionage was very strict and were worried that it would be difficult to start, they were caught by the giant hand of the people.

    一个普通公民的警惕
    9月下旬的一个晚上，广州市第十竹器手工业生产合作社社员李义九家里突然来了一个从香港来的好几年没有来往的亲戚，他是李义九妻子的哥哥麦暖。
    这天晚上，李义九出去看戏了，他的妻子麦杏宽接待哥哥住下来。
    第二天，麦杏宽对李义九说：“我拿了哥哥的香港身份证去报了户口，身份证上写他的名字叫‘麦忠’。”李义九一听，觉得不对头，李义九想：他原来叫“麦暖”，为什么改名呢？他和麦忠闲谈起来。麦忠说，因为他在香港做工的玻璃厂停工了，所以特地来探望妹妹和妹夫。李义九看见他从香港带来不少生油、面饼、鱿鱼、冰糖等东西，随身还有一个新皮箱，看起来倒还阔气，不像失业的样子，李义九怀疑他是搞走私的。
    过了两天，李义九觉得麦忠更不对头了，每天麦忠都是睡到上午十时左右才起床，整天不外出，躲在屋里。李义九问他：“你为什么睡得这样迟才起床呢？为什么不到外面看一看广州的建设情况？”麦忠含糊地回答：“在香港都是睡得这样迟才起床的。外面没有什么好看。”李义九这时想：搞走私也用不着整天躲着呀。他想起解放前麦忠在乡下当过土匪，又曾经在国民党的县党部做过事，李义九怀疑起麦忠来了。
    在麦忠到广州后的第四天早上，李义九正在门口做竹器，忽然看见一个人鬼鬼祟祟地在他的屋侧经过，彼此打个照面，李义九认得这是吴满安，但是吴满安连招呼都不打就急忙躲开了。李义九想：吴满安是在香港居住的，什么时候到了广州？为什么不进来坐一坐？他心里又起了一个疑问。过了两天，是中午时候，李义九正在破竹，忽然又瞥见吴满安走过来，他一看见李义九就躲到墙背去了。这就更加引起了李义九的怀疑和警惕。
    9月29日中午，李义九家里突然来了一个从未见过面的中年男子，一进门便问：“这是麦杏宽的家吗？”
    麦杏宽觉得很奇怪，便反问他：“你是那里人，要找谁？”
    中年男子说：“我是麦杏宽的同乡，我要找她。”
    李义九夫妇正在怀疑这个“不速之客”的时候，麦忠急忙从小阁仔走下来，连声说道：“喂！喂！”就慌忙带那中年男子走出后门。不久，麦忠手里提着个竹篮进来，里面有些香蕉、杨桃，还有一包用报纸包着的东西。李义九心知这里面一定有鬼。他立即往公安派出所去报告了这个情况。
    公安机关根据李义九的检举报告和过去掌握的材料，经过紧急而严密的侦查，及时将麦忠依法逮捕。同时，公安人员在麦忠睡的木枕里搜出一颗美制的计时炸弹。
    在侦讯室里，特务麦忠顽固地拒绝坦白，但在罪证确凿面前和经过公安人员的教育以后，麦忠才供认了同案犯吴满安。公安机关根据他们掌握的情况和李义九检举的线索，迅速将特务吴满安依法逮捕归案，并且缴获美制计时炸弹一颗。此外，还根据吴满安的供认，依法逮捕了香港国民党特务机关派遣来广州与麦、吴两犯联系的化名为徐小姐的特务分子李洁萍（女）。
    根据麦、吴两犯的供认，他们都是国民党“情报局”特务组织所属的特务。他们事先在香港受过投放计时炸弹的专门训练，远在7月间，香港国民党特务机关就开始部署要在10月10日在广州进行大规模爆炸破坏的阴谋活动。当他们被派遣潜入广州之前，香港国民党特务头子给他们指定爆炸的目标。他们到广州后，曾经侦察了爆炸目标——长堤电影院、广州酒家和广州往佛山的火车站。可是，正当他们觉得广大群众防奸反特工作十分严密而耽心难于下手的时候，他们就被人民的巨掌抓住了。
