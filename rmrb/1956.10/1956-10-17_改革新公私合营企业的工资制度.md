    Reforming the Wage System of Newly Joint State-Private Enterprises

    The State Council has issued regulations on several issues concerning wage reform in newly joint state-private enterprises. Wage reform in these enterprises is about to begin nationwide.

    The purpose and task of this wage reform is to improve the chaotic and unreasonable wage situation in newly joint state-private enterprises, gradually establish a socialist wage system, and appropriately raise the wages of workers, staff, and private personnel whose original wage standards were too low. After the establishment of joint state-private ownership throughout entire industries, the enthusiasm of employees generally increased, and production and business developed greatly. However, the old wage system has not been improved accordingly. The wages of similar types of industries, enterprises, and personnel in the same region are sometimes very high and sometimes very low, with serious instances of unequal pay for equal work. This unreasonable phenomenon hinders the full mobilization of employees' labor enthusiasm and the implementation of socialist management principles. Therefore, it is of significant economic and political importance to carry out wage reform in newly joint state-private enterprises at this opportune time.

    The basic principle of this wage reform is: After the establishment of joint state-private ownership throughout entire industries, the wage standards and wage systems of joint state-private industrial, construction, transportation, and commercial enterprises should gradually align with those of state-owned enterprises of the same nature and similar scale in the same region. Compared with the wage standards of similar state-owned enterprises in the locality, the current wage standards of workers, staff, and private personnel in newly joint state-private enterprises should not be reduced if they are higher, and should be gradually increased in stages if they are lower, based on the production and business conditions and actual possibilities of the enterprise.

    Since the goal is to align with state-owned enterprises, why not reduce the higher ones and gradually increase the lower ones? Wouldn't it be more thorough and straightforward to align them all at once? From a "convenient" point of view, that might be more straightforward, but it is not realistic.

    The reason why the current wage standards lower than those of state-owned enterprises must be gradually increased is that only in this way can we align with the actual conditions of current production and business, and adhere to the principle of gradually improving workers' lives on the basis of developing production and increasing labor productivity. Enterprises with relatively low current wage standards are mostly those with lower levels of equipment and technology, or those that operate with simpler product varieties and smaller business volumes. If wages are increased too high and too quickly, deviating from the actual level of production and business, it will create difficulties for production and business, which would be detrimental to the working class. At the same time, enterprises with large differences in wage standards compared with state-owned enterprises are mostly located in counties and towns. When these enterprises increase wages, they must consider the income of a large number of handicraftsmen and small traders in rural areas. Therefore, it is reasonable and will be supported by the masses of employees to increase wages in stages as production and business levels improve.

    Not reducing the higher ones is a very important principle in this wage reform of newly joint state-private enterprises. Some enterprises, or some employees within enterprises, currently have wage standards that are higher than those of state-owned enterprises. According to incomplete statistics from several large cities, approximately 40% of employees have wages higher than those of state-owned enterprises, and 60% of employees have wages equivalent to or lower than those of state-owned enterprises. If the higher ones are reduced, a considerable number of employees will inevitably have their wages reduced. It would be unacceptable to implement joint state-private ownership while reducing employees' wages. At the same time, in order to facilitate the peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, it is even more unfair to reduce employees' wages while the high salaries of capitalists are not reduced during the process of joint state-private ownership. Of course, the phenomena of large disparities in wages and unequal pay for equal work do affect production, employee unity, and even, to some extent, the relationship between the Party and the masses. However, the dissatisfaction of the masses of employees with high wages, except for a very few whose wages are extremely disproportionate to their technical abilities, is not necessarily a demand to reduce them. In reality, they hope to raise the lower wages. If the higher wages are reduced, there will be more problems. Therefore, not reducing the higher ones is a special measure that must be taken under the current circumstances.

    Should the higher ones be increased slightly more since they are not being reduced? No, they should not be increased either. Because in newly joint state-private enterprises, there are fewer large enterprises and more small enterprises, and labor productivity is generally lower than in state-owned enterprises. The current wage standards are already higher than those of state-owned enterprises, so it would be unreasonable to increase them further. At the same time, wage reform can only narrow the distance between the wages of joint state-private enterprises and state-owned enterprises. If this distance is widened again, it will create greater difficulties for the planned allocation of labor and future wage adjustments. Of course, not raising wage standards does not mean that the actual wages received by this part of the employees will not increase. For example, if a piece-rate wage or bonus wage system is implemented on the basis of the new wage standards, the actual income can be increased accordingly when employees perform well, exceed quotas, or complete bonus targets.

    Of course, it is impossible to immediately unify the wage treatments that were left over from the past in newly joint state-private enterprises, or to immediately unify them with the wage treatments of state-owned enterprises. The unification we are seeking is mainly the unification of guiding principles and policies; the steps and timing can be different. Under the current conditions, we can only rectify the original chaotic and unreasonable wage situation according to unified guiding principles and policies, so that the masses of employees genuinely feel that the wage situation has improved and that there is a certain system after the establishment of joint state-private ownership, thereby enhancing the sense of responsibility and labor enthusiasm of the masses of employees as masters of their own affairs, and promoting the further development of production and business. It is also impossible to demand that everything be completely reasonable at once.

    Since we are gradually achieving unification and rationality, we must proceed from reality, adapt to local conditions, and have a certain degree of flexibility when establishing a new wage system. Therefore, the State Council's regulations on several issues concerning wage reform in newly joint state-private enterprises point out: the same region and the same industry can adopt two or three different wage standards; wage grades can be different from those of state-owned enterprises due to different levels of equipment and technology and to take into account the current wage situation; variable wages should be distinguished by their nature, handled separately and in sequence, and specific measures should be taken according to the actual situation of the enterprise.

    Attention should be paid to absorbing the reasonable factors of the old wage system, overcoming its unreasonable factors, and carrying out reforms after thorough investigation and research. Do not easily abolish it. For old systems that are indeed unreasonable, employees should also be persuaded and educated, and gradually abolished or replaced with reasonable systems on the basis of their conscious willingness.

    In short, do not attempt to solve all problems through this reform, but rather distinguish between priorities and carry out reforms gradually. Generally speaking, we should first seek to basically unify and rationalize the wage system within the enterprise. As for the situation of large disparities in wages between enterprises and industries, we can only make improvements to varying degrees.

    Currently, all localities must grasp the main aspects and key links of the problem to smoothly complete the task of this wage reform. Party committees at all provincial and municipal levels must strengthen leadership over this work, make full preparations before wage reform, and especially focus on training cadres and activists. It is necessary to carry out ideological education work and specific explanations of policies and systems based on the actual situation of the masses, and carry out the reform of the wage system on the basis of enhancing the understanding of the masses. Larger grassroots enterprises should establish labor wage work organizations to strengthen the management of labor wage work. Trade union organizations should actively establish wage work committees in these enterprises to strengthen mass work, so as to ensure the smooth completion of the task of wage reform.

### 改革新公私合营企业的工资制度

    改革新公私合营企业的工资制度
    国务院发布了关于新公私合营企业工资改革中若干问题的规定。新公私合营企业的工资改革就要在全国范围内开始进行了。
    这次工资改革的目的和任务是改进新公私合营企业中混乱的不合理的工资状况，逐步建立起社会主义的工资制度，适当地提高原来工资标准过低的工人、职员和私方人员的工资。公私合营企业在全行业合营以后，职工的劳动热情普遍高涨，生产、营业有了很大的发展，但是，旧有的工资制度却没有相应的改善。同一地区中性质相同的行业、企业和各类人员之间的工资，有的很高，有的很低，同工不同酬的现象十分严重。这种不合理的现象，阻碍着职工劳动积极性的充分发挥和社会主义经营管理原则的贯彻执行。因此，适时地在新公私合营企业中进行工资改革，有重要的经济意义和政治意义。
    这次工资改革的基本方针是：全行业公私合营以后实行公私合营的工业、建筑、交通运输和商业企业的工资标准和工资制度，应该逐步向同一地区、性质相同、规模相近的国营企业看齐。新公私合营企业的工人、职员和私方人员的现行工资标准和当地同类性质国营企业的工资标准比较起来，高了的不减少，低了的根据企业生产、营业情况和实际可能，分期地逐步增加。
    既然是向国营企业看齐，为什么高的不减少、低的逐步增加呢？把低的提上去，高的减下来，一步看齐，不是更彻底、更痛快一些吗？从“方便”的观点看来，这也许是痛快些；但是，这是不切合实际的。
    现行工资标准比国营企业低的所以要逐步增加，是因为只有这样做，才切合当前生产和营业的实际情况，才能符合在发展生产、提高劳动生产率的基础上逐步改善工人生活的原则。现行工资标准比较低的企业，大都是设备和技术水平比较低或者经营品种比较简单、营业额比较小的企业，如果工资增加得过高过快，离开了生产和营业的实际水平，那就会给生产和营业造成困难，这对工人阶级是不利的。同时，和国营企业工资标准相差较大的企业，大都在县镇，这些企业在增加工资的时候，就不能不同农村中大量手工业者和小商贩的收入联系起来考虑。所以，随着生产、营业水平的提高，工资分期地逐步增加，是合理的，是会得到职工群众拥护的。
    高的不减，是这次新公私合营企业工资改革中一个很重要的原则。现行工资标准比国营企业高的，有的是整个企业，有的是企业中的一部分职工。根据几个大城市不完全的统计，大约有40％职工的工资高于国营企业，有60％职工的工资相当于或者低于国营企业。如果高的减下来，势必要有相当数量的职工减少工资。实行公私合营，而职工的工资却减少了，这是说不过去的。同时，为了有利于资本主义工商业的和平改造，在公私合营过程中，资本家的高工资不减，在这种情况下，减少职工的工资，更是不公平的。当然，工资高低悬殊和同工不同酬的现象，确实影响生产，影响职工团结，甚至在某种程度上影响党和群众的关系。但是，职工群众对高工资的不满意，除了极个别的工资和技术能力极不相称的以外，不一定是要求把它减下来，实际上是希望把工资低的提上去。如果把工资高的减下来，问题更多。因此，高的不减，是目前情况下所必需采取的一种特殊的措施。
    高的不减少，是否可以稍稍再增加一些呢？也不增加。因为在新公私合营企业中，大企业少，小企业多，劳动生产率一般比国营企业低，现行工资标准已经比国营企业高了，再增加是不合理的。同时，经过工资改革，只能缩小公私合营企业同国营企业工资的距离，如果再扩大这个距离，就会给劳动力的计划分配和今后调整工资增加更大的困难。当然，工资标准不提高，并不等于这部分职工的实得工资也不增加。例如在新的工资标准的基础上推行计件工资或者奖励工资制度，当职工工作成绩良好，超过定额或者完成奖励指标时，实际收入也就可以相应地增加。
    当然，要把新公私合营企业中过去遗留下来的工资待遇，立即统一起来，或者立即和国营企业的工资待遇统一起来，是不可能的。我们要求的统一，主要是方针政策的统一，步骤、时间可以不同。在当前的条件下，只能根据统一的方针政策，把原有混乱不合理的工资状况加以整顿，使职工群众切实感到公私合营以后，工资状况有所改善，有了一定的制度，从而提高职工群众主人公的责任感和劳动积极性，推动生产和营业进一步的发展。要求一下子做到全部合理，也是不可能的。
    既然是逐步做到统一合理，在建立新工资制度的时候，就要从实际出发，因地制宜，有一定的灵活性。所以国务院关于新公私合营企业工资改革中若干问题的规定中指出：同一地区、同一行业，可以采用两种或者三种不同的工资标准；工资等级，因设备、技术水平不同和照顾现实工资状况，可以与国营企业有所不同；对于变相工资，则应该区别性质，分别先后，并根据企业的实际情况，采取不同的办法具体处理。
    对于旧的工资制度，要注意吸收其合理的因素，克服其不合理的因素，经过充分的调查研究，然后进行改革，不要轻易取消。对于确实不合理的旧制度，也要说服教育职工群众，在他们的自觉自愿的基础上逐步取消，或者建立合理的制度去代替它。
    总之，不要企图通过这一次改革就解决所有的问题，而要分清轻重缓急，逐步地改革。一般地说，首先应该求得企业内部的工资制度基本上统一合理，至于企业之间、行业之间的工资高低悬殊的状况，只能进行不同程度的改善。
    各地目前要抓住问题的主要方面和主要环节，顺利地完成这次工资改革的任务。各省、市委要加强对这个工作的领导，在工资改革以前要充分做好准备工作，特别要抓紧训练干部和积极分子的工作。要针对群众的实际情况，做好思想教育工作和对政策、制度的具体的解释工作，在提高群众的认识的基础上进行工资制度的改革。较大的基层企业，应该建立劳动工资工作机构，加强对劳动工资工作的管理。工会组织应该积极地在这些企业中建立工资工作委员会，加强群众工作，以保证顺利地完成工资改革的任务。
