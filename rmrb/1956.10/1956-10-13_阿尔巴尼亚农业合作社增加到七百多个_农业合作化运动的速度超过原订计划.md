Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 11th – According to the Albanian Telegraph Agency on the 10th, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in Albania had increased to 758 by the end of September this year, and the cultivated land they owned accounted for 27.6% of the country's total cultivated land area. In addition, Albania has also established approximately 280 primary agricultural collective labor organizations – mutual cultivation societies.

	This year, the pace of agricultural cooperativization in Albania has greatly exceeded the original plan. At the end of last year, there were only 318 agricultural production cooperatives in Albania. The plan for this year was to double the number of cooperatives. This target was reached several months ago. Now, in some areas, more than 40% of the cultivated land has been cooperativized.

    阿尔巴尼亚农业合作社增加到七百多个
    农业合作化运动的速度超过原订计划
    新华社布拉格11日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社10日报道，阿尔巴尼亚的农业生产合作社到今年9月底已经增加到七百五十八个，它们拥有的耕地已经占全国耕地总面积的27.6％。此外，阿尔巴尼亚还成立了约二百八十个初级的农业集体劳动组织——共耕社。
    今年，阿尔巴尼亚农业合作化的速度大大超过了原订计划。在去年年底，阿尔巴尼亚只有三百一十八个农业生产合作社。今年计划把合作社的数目增加一倍。这个指标已经在几个月之前就达到了。现在，有些地区已经有40％以上的耕地实现了合作化。
