    A Good Method for Decentralized Storage of New Cotton

    This newspaper reports: The "May First" Agricultural Cooperative in Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, and the First Agricultural Cooperative in Nanshe Township, Fuping County, have this year contracted out the work of picking and drying cotton to the cooperative members. According to this method, the cotton picked by each cooperative member is weighed by the team's work point recorder, and then taken back to their own homes for drying and storage, to be handed over at the time of ginning. The cotton handed over by the cooperative members is based on the amount of cotton they picked, less any losses according to the cooperative's regulations. According to their experience, doing so can avoid losses caused by the cooperative lacking cotton storage warehouses.

    分散保管新棉的方法好
    本报讯　陕西省咸阳县“五一”农业社和富平县南社乡第一农业社，今年把拾棉花和晒棉花的工作一起包给社员。按照这个办法，每个社员摘拾的棉花，经过队里的计工员过秤后，就拿回自己家去晾晒和保存，到轧花的时候再交出来。社员们交出的棉花是根据自己拾花的数量，按社里的规定减去损耗。根据他们的经验，这样做，可以避免因社里缺少储棉仓库而造成的损失。
