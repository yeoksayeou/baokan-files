In the country of McCarthy and Matusow (the notorious perjurer), it is not surprising that journalists like John William Powell Jr. and Sylvia Campbell Powell, former editors of the "China Monthly Review," and Julian Schuman, who are loyal to their conscience and their profession, are considered to have committed heinous crimes.

Their crime lies in telling the truth—the truth about the People's China, the truth about the Korean War. Their crime lies in, as American journalists, resolutely refusing the "remuneration" of the "Central Intelligence Agency" and failing to provide the foreign "intelligence" that Allen Dulles and his ilk required as a matter of course. Their crime lies in having a backbone strong enough that, after being deprived of their freedom to live, and under the shadow of imprisonment, they continued to tell the American people the truth about China in speeches and writings. In a word, the crime of the Powells, etc., lies in resolutely refusing to serve as cannon fodder for the Cold War, and in not disgracing the glorious traditions of Jefferson and Lincoln.

What's more, recently more and more Americans have been demanding to hear the truth about People's China and demanding a change in America's arrogant and foolish China policy. As a result, more and more American journalists are eager to come to China to see the truth of the new China with their own eyes. The iron curtain dropped on journalists by the State Department only aroused anger and ridicule. Therefore, the American ruling clique felt it even more necessary to kill the chicken to scare the monkeys, and to take the stubborn Powells as an example.

As the old saying goes, "If you want to condemn someone, you can always find a pretext." Since the Powells and the other two were bound to be charged with crimes, after three years of fabrication, thirteen charges were written down, and the crime was "sedition." In the indictment against the Powells, etc., the Cold War experts themselves turned up the old account of germ warfare, probably trying to take the opportunity to whitewash their beastly behavior. However, there is plenty of human and material evidence, and this stinking outhouse will only become more and more foul the more it is cleaned out. In addition, regardless of the fact that people with sober minds would laugh out loud, even the Powells' saying that the Chiang Kai-shek government was corrupt was considered a crime, perhaps to make up the "unlucky" number of thirteen. But in this way, it not only revealed that this masterpiece came from the hand of the "China Lobby," but also showed the embarrassment of a dimwit racking his brains and exhausting his fabrications. The Cold War experts were confident that the thirteen major crimes would result in a total sentence of 260 years in prison and a fine of $130,000 for the main defendants, which would be enough to serve as a warning. In fact, such an American-made case only proves once again that in the United States under the rule of Wall Street, only the freedom to call a stag a horse and to distort the truth is allowed, but not the freedom to tell the truth and to make truthful reports; only professional informers are allowed the freedom to give false testimony and thereby get rich, and it even attempts to prevent American journalists from having the freedom to refuse to serve as secret agents and spies.

This is American-style freedom. This is today's "free America."

Indeed, in the face of honest people all over the world, it is the cruel and ugly American ruling clique that is on trial, not the Powells and Julian Schuman. From the Rosenberg's wrongful conviction in 1953 to the Powell case in 1956, the American ruling clique, which once aroused worldwide public outrage by killing Sacco and Vanzetti (American progressive workers of Italian origin, the case of 1920-7), is clearly accelerating its decline and fall.

    从鲍惠尔案看“自由美国”
    思慕
    在麦卡锡、马图索（臭名远扬的假证人）的国度里，像前“密勒氏评论报”编辑鲍惠尔夫妇、朱立安·舒曼那样忠于自己的良心、忠于自己的职业的新闻工作者，被认为犯了十恶不赦之罪，那是没有什么奇怪的。
    他们的罪在于说了真话——关于人民中国的真话，关于朝鲜战争的真话。他们的罪在于身为美国记者而竟断然拒绝“中央情报局”的“酬偿”，没有照例提供出艾伦·杜勒斯之流所需要的外国“情报”。他们的罪在于骨头够硬，在被剥夺了生活的自由之后，在牢狱的阴影之下，还是在演讲和写作中继续把中国的实况告诉美国人民。一句话，鲍惠尔等的罪在于坚决不肯充当冷战的炮灰，在于没有辱没了杰斐逊和林肯的光荣的传统。
    何况，最近越来越多的美国人要求听到关于人民中国的真话，要求改变美国的狂妄而愚蠢的对华政策，因而渴望到中国来亲眼一看新中国的真相的美国新闻记者也越来越多，国务院给记者们落下的铁幕只引起了愤怒和嘲笑，因而，杀鸡给猴子看，在美国统治集团看来更有拿倔强的鲍惠尔夫妇们来开刀的必要。
    老话说：“欲加之罪，何患无辞？”罪既然定要加在鲍惠尔夫妇等三人头上，经过三年的罗织，罪状便写下了十三条，罪名是什么“煽动叛乱”。在控诉鲍惠尔等的罪状里，冷战专家们把细菌战的旧账自己也翻出来，大概是妄图借机把自己的兽行洗刷一番。但是，人证物证有的是，这个臭茅厕只会越掏越臭。此外，不怕有清醒头脑的人哄堂大笑，连鲍惠尔夫妇说蒋介石政府腐败，也算是一条罪状，也许是为了凑足十三条这个“不祥”之数。但这样一来，既露出了这篇杰作出自“院外援华集团”的手笔的马脚，又显见低能儿搜索枯肠、罗织俱穷的窘态。冷战专家们满以为按着十三大罪判刑，主要被告人可能总共要处二百六十年的徒刑和十三万美元的罚款，足昭炯戒。其实，这样一桩美制案件，只是又一次证明了：在华尔街统治下的美国，只许有指鹿为马、颠倒黑白的自由，却不许有说真话、作真实报道的自由；只许职业告密者有作假证并因而发财致富的自由，甚至企图不让美国记者有拒绝兼做特务间谍的自由。
    这是美国式的自由。这是今天的“自由美国”。
    的确，在全世界正直人类的面前，受审讯的正是残酷、丑恶的美国统治集团，而不是鲍惠尔夫妇和朱立安·舒曼。从1953年的罗森堡夫妇冤狱到1956年的鲍惠尔案件，曾经以杀害萨柯和范齐蒂（原籍意大利的美国进步工人，1920—7年的案件）而激起全世界公愤的美国统治集团，显然是在加速地堕落和没落了。
