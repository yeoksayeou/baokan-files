　　About a hundred kilometers from Moscow, amidst a forest, we, the invited guests, arrived at a completely new town. This is a center for nuclear research in the Soviet Union.
　　The roads, residences, and buildings are all brand new. Most of the buildings were probably built in the last two or three years. The people here have borrowed the name of a nearby small river to call this city, which was specially built for scientists.
　　A few days ago, representatives of the member countries of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (all outstanding scientists from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries) held a meeting here. In front of an elegant and beautiful building, flags of the Soviet Union and various brotherly countries were planted. A shiny black plaque bore the words in the languages of these countries: Joint Institute for Nuclear Research.
　　The Joint Institute for Nuclear Research was established in March of this year. Its predecessor was the Institute of Nuclear Problems of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The Soviet Union completely and unconditionally handed over all the equipment and personnel of this institute for the use of scientists from various countries.
　　It is still difficult to estimate how this move will promote the development of modern nuclear physics. Scientists point out that gathering the strength of scientists from various countries, concentrating the financial and material resources of many countries, is of great significance for solving the problem of exploring the secrets of the atomic nucleus. The Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries have once again set a new example of international cooperation.
　　The world-renowned Soviet Union’s two particle accelerators, a synchrocyclotron that has been in use for seven years and a synchrophasotron that has just been installed, are located in the laboratory of this joint research center. These two accelerators are the largest in the world, naturally, this is in terms of these two types of accelerators. The United States also has other types of the world's largest accelerators. Scientists use these tools to create high-energy, high-current particles to bombard atomic nuclei.
　　We entered this unusual laboratory.
　　The synchrocyclotron, which can accelerate protons to 680 million electron volts, is installed in a tall reinforced concrete building with four floors. This scientific laboratory is like a power station, and also like a large workshop in a large factory. As soon as you enter, it reminds you of a huge working motor equipment, but at this time the laboratory is in a "rest" state, so our group can safely and unreservedly enter.
　　If the accelerator starts working, then scientists must leave quickly, and no one can directly see the working condition of the accelerator. The control room is in a dedicated two-story building far away. The hall where the accelerator is located is surrounded by concrete walls up to eleven meters thick, because the high-energy charged particles emitted from the accelerator can break apart the atomic nuclei of matter, which of course the human body cannot withstand.
　　Standing in front of this complex machine, we cannot help but marvel at the magical power of science and technology. It is this equipment that helps mankind delve into the depths of the nuclear world and understand the true mystery of the composition of cosmic matter. The atomic nucleus is invisible, intangible, and so small that if the atom were magnified into a huge building like Moscow University on Lenin Hills, the atomic nucleus would be no bigger than a sesame seed. But the charged particles accelerated by this machine have the power to smash the atomic nucleus.
　　This complex synchrocyclotron is marked as a product of the Kirov Electric Factory in Leningrad, which was installed successfully in 1949 through the cooperation of many industrial departments under the leadership of many famous scholars. The central part of the machine is a circular vacuum chamber with a diameter of six meters, composed of seven thousand tons of electromagnets. The top and bottom of the vacuum chamber are marked in red and blue, indicating the two poles of this strong magnetic field.
　　The charged particles emitted from the high-voltage electrodes revolve in this magnetic field, accelerating to the same speed as light, forming a strong charged particle stream, which is the "atomic cannonball" with 680 million electron volts.
　　The scientific staff leading the tour gave us many metaphors to explain the principle of the accelerator. The simplest metaphor is the sling used by ancient people. The strap on the sling is like the magnetic field on the accelerator. The magnetic field pulls the charged particles, making them rotate faster and faster, just like the strap pulls the stone to turn, faster and faster.
　　When the particles are accelerated to a very high speed, they will come out from a special channel in the vacuum chamber, part of which "dies" midway, and the other part enters the adjacent hall filled with testing instruments through the channel on the concrete wall.
　　These instruments capture high-energy charged particles, so these "atomic cannonballs" explode, causing sparks, making sounds, and leaving special continuous traces on photographic films.
　　We walked to another laboratory in this scientific city that was even more powerful.
　　From the outside, this is a building like a large circular theater, with a diameter of seventy meters. The shape of this building is reminiscent of some ancient Greek and Roman buildings, but inside are not statues and works of art, but the great masterpiece of modern science—a complex device called the synchrophasotron.
　　This accelerator will not be operational until the summer of next year. But as soon as we walked in, we couldn't help but stop. The scientific staff urged us to move forward with a smile, and said that there was nothing terrible now, although there were some small "dangers." Here, there have been more than one "problem": someone's watch was broken because it was affected by a strong magnetic force; someone walked into a narrow passage and suddenly couldn't get out, and had to be helped by others because he was carrying a bunch of keys; someone suddenly couldn't lift his feet because the iron nails on his shoes were exposed; female comrades would also be attracted by the magnetic force because they had hairpins on their heads. However, if you don't get too close to the machine in a few places, then the above phenomena will not occur.
　　As for when this accelerator starts working, no one can walk in, just like the synchrocyclotron. Its power is much greater, it can accelerate particles to 10 billion electron volts, and can break open more and stronger atomic nuclei.
　　The synchrophasotron is an annular vacuum chamber composed of 36,000 tons of magnets. The diameter of this ring is 56 meters. Charged particles have to make 4.5 million revolutions in this annular vacuum chamber in 3.3 seconds, and the total distance they travel is about two and a half times the distance between the earth and the moon.
　　The accelerator can not only smash atomic nuclei, but also realize the fantasies of ancient alchemists, and can create new elements, even new chemical elements that do not exist in nature. Naturally, the most important thing is that the accelerator helps people understand the laws of the atomic world, so as to master its unparalleled power to serve mankind.
　　The Soviet Union was able to accelerate particles to 1 million electron volts in 1930, and to 100 million electron volts in 1944. From 1945 to now, the Soviet Union has been able to accelerate to hundreds of billions of electron volts. Now it is also preparing to build a 50 billion electron volt accelerator.
　　We visited the control room far away from the accelerator, which is a two-story building. Cables buried deep underground connect the console of this building to the accelerator.
　　The scenery in the area where the institute is located is extremely beautiful. You can see the Volga River in the distance, surrounded by one Russian forest after another. We came here early in the morning, and it was sunset when we returned. We often looked back at this scientific city with only 6,500 people. Here, scientists combine their ideals of conquering nature with the ideal of making atomic energy serve human peace and happiness.

    参观联合核子研究中心
　　新华社驻莫斯科记者　李楠
    离莫斯科一百多公里的地方，在一片丛林中间，我们被邀请参观的人来到了一个完全新兴的城镇。这是苏联一个研究原子核的中心。
    道路、住宅、楼房完全是崭新的面貌。多半的建筑大概都是最近两、三年建造的。这里的人们借用了附近一条小河的名称来称呼这座专门为科学家们兴建起来的城市。
    前几天，联合核子研究所的成员国代表（他们都是苏联和人民民主国家杰出的科学家们）在这里举行了会议。一个幽雅美观的楼房门前插着苏联和各兄弟国家的旗帜。一块漆黑光亮的牌子上用这些国家的文字写着：联合核子研究所。
    联合核子研究所是今年三月间成立的。前身是苏联科学院核子问题研究所。苏联完全无偿地将这个研究所的全部设备和人员交给各国的科学家们使用。
    现在还很难估计，这一举动将如何促进近代核子物理学的发展。科学家们指出：集合各国科学家的力量，集中许多国家的财力、物力，对解决探索原子核秘密的问题有重大的意义。苏联和各人民民主国家又树立了一个国际合作的新型榜样。
    举世闻名的苏联两座粒子加速器，一座已经使用了七年的同步回旋加速器和一座刚刚安装完毕的同步稳相加速器，就在这个联合研究中心的实验室里面。这两座加速器是世界最大的，自然，这是就这两种类型的加速器而言，美国也拥有其他类型的世界上最大的加速器。科学家们就是用这种工具制造高能、强流的粒子来轰击原子核的。
    我们走进了这座不平常的实验室。
    能使质子加速到六亿八千万电子伏特的同步回旋加速器，安装在一座高大的有四层楼高的钢筋混凝土楼房里面。这座科学实验室倒像一座发电站，也像一个大工厂的大型车间。一走进去，就令人想起一部巨大的正在工作的电机设备，但是这时实验室正处在“休息”状态，因而我们这群人才能安全地毫无顾忌地走了进去。
    如果加速器开始工作，那么科学家们就必须赶快离开，没有人能够直接看到加速器的工作情况。操纵室是在离得很远的一座专门的两层楼的楼房里面。加速器所在的大厅被厚达十一公尺的混凝土墙包围起来。因为从加速器里放射出来的高能带电粒子能够把物质的原子核冲开，当然不是人体所承受得了的。
    站在这部复杂的机器面前，我们不能不惊叹科学技术的神奇力量。正是这部设备帮助人类钻进核子世界的深处，了解宇宙物质构成的真正奥妙。原子核看不见，捉摸不到，渺小到这样的程度：如果把原子放大成像列宁山上莫斯科大学那样的庞大建筑，那么原子核也不过芝麻那么大小。但是这个机器所加速了的带电粒子却具有这种把原子核粉碎的力量。
    这部复杂的同步回旋加速器上标明是列宁格勒基洛夫电力工厂的产品，这是在许多著名学者领导下，由许多工业部门合作在1949年安装成功的。机器的中心部分是由七千吨电磁铁组成的、直径六公尺的圆形真空室。真空室上下各标有红色和蓝色，表示出这个强大磁场的两极。
    从高压电极上发射出来的带电粒子就在这个磁场内回旋，加速到具有和光一样的速度，形成强大的带粒电子流，这就是具有六亿八千万电子伏特的“原子炮弹”。
    领导参观的科学工作人员给我们说了许多比喻来说明加速器的道理。一种最简单的比喻就是古代人所用的皮带投石器。投石器上的皮带就好比加速器上的磁场。磁场拉着带电粒子，让它越来越快地回旋转动，就像皮带曳着石子转一样，越转越快。
    粒子被加快到很高的速度，便会从真空室里的专门孔道出来，其中一部分中途“死亡”了，另一部分就通过混凝土墙壁上的孔道进入隔壁布满着测验仪器的大厅。
    这些仪器捕捉着高能带电粒子，于是这些“原子炮弹”便爆炸开来，引起火花，发出声响，在照相底片上留下特殊的连续的痕迹。
    我们走到了这个科学城中另一个效力更加强大的实验室。
    从外表看来，这是一个像大型的圆形剧场似的建筑，它的直径有七十公尺。这个建筑的外形令人想起一些希腊罗马古代的大建筑物，但是那里面不是神像和艺术品，而是近代科学的伟大杰作——被称为同步稳相加速器的复杂装置。
    这部加速器大约要到明年夏天才能开始工作。但我们一走进去，也不能不停止了脚步。科学工作人员微笑着催促我们前进，并说现在没有甚么可怕的，虽然也有一些小小的“危险”存在。在这里，曾经不止发生过一次“问题”，有人的手表弄坏了，因为受了强大磁力的影响；有人走进狭小的过道里，突然走不出来，必须要别人去帮助拖他出来，因为他身上带着一串钥匙；有人突然脚提不起来了，因为鞋上的铁钉露在外面；女同志也会因为头上有发夹而受到磁力的吸引。不过，如果不在几个地方过分地接近机器，那么上面的现象就不会发生。
    至于这部加速器一旦工作起来，那么也像同步回旋加速器一样，谁也不能走进去。它的威力更强大得多，能够将粒子加速到一百亿电子伏特，能够冲击开更多的和更坚固的原子核。
    同步稳相加速器是用三万六千吨磁铁组成的一座环形真空室，这个环形的直径是五十六公尺。带电粒子以三点三秒的时间要在这个环形真空室里转四百五十万转，它所经过的全程约等于地球和月亮之间的距离的两倍半。
    加速器不仅能够粉碎原子核，并且能够实现古代炼金师们的幻想，能够创造出新原素，甚至大自然所不存在的新化学原素。自然，最主要的是加速器帮助人们弄清楚原子世界的规律，以掌握它那无比的威力，来为人类服务。
    苏联在1930年就开始能够将粒子加速到一百万电子伏特，到1944年能够加速到一亿电子伏特。从1945年到现在，苏联已能加速到成百亿电子伏特。现在还正在准备建造五百亿电子伏特的加速器。
    我们参观了和加速器离得很远的操纵室，这是一座两层的大楼。深埋在地下的电缆把这座大楼的操纵台和加速器联系起来。
    研究所所在地区的景色极其优美。远远地可以看见伏尔加的河水，周围是一片接着一片的俄罗斯的森林。我们一清早来到这里，到重返归途时，已经是夕阳西下的时候。我们频频回首遥望这座还只有六千五百人口的科学城。在这里，科学家们把他们征服自然的理想和使原子能为人类和平幸福服务的理想结合在一起。
