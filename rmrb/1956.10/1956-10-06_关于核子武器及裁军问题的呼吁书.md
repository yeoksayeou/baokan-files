Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, October 4th: The Eighth Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council passed an appeal to the working people and trade unions of the world on the issue of atomic and thermonuclear weapons and disarmament.

The appeal stated that the recent relaxation of international tensions and the expansion of international cooperation have created favorable conditions for stopping the arms race, reducing armed forces and armaments, and banning atomic and hydrogen weapons.

The World Federation of Trade Unions has always opposed the production, testing, and stockpiling of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and has consistently supported the struggle of the working people for these goals.

However, the disarmament issue remains unresolved, and the continuing arms race harbors the danger of new wars, and leads to inflation, increased prices and taxes, and a decline in the living standards of the people.

Therefore, hundreds of millions of people with different political views and religious beliefs are demanding a practical solution to the disarmament issue, a halt to the production and testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the destruction of existing stockpiles of atomic and hydrogen bombs, reductions in military spending, and the use of the funds freed up for peaceful purposes.

The resolution stated that the vital interests of the people of all countries require all trade union organizations to eliminate their existing differences and work hand in hand to jointly strive for a solution to the disarmament issue and the issue of banning the production, use, and testing of atomic and thermonuclear weapons.

The World Federation of Trade Unions Council calls on all international trade union organizations and national trade union organizations, as well as the working people of all countries, to intensify their efforts to achieve disarmament, to ban atomic and hydrogen weapons and to halt the testing of such weapons, and to destroy stockpiles of atomic and hydrogen bombs.

The resolution stated: As long as we act in unison, we can and will quickly solve the disarmament issue and open a path to lasting peace and improving the material well-being of the people of all countries.

    关于核子武器及裁军问题的呼吁书
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社索非亚4日讯：世界工会联合会理事会第八次会议通过一项就原子武器和热核子武器以及裁军问题致全世界劳动人民和工会的呼吁书。
    呼吁书说，最近几年来国际紧张局势的缓和和国际合作的扩大，为停止扩充军备、为裁减武装部队和军备、为禁止原子武器和氢武器创造了有利的条件。
    世界工联一向反对生产、试验和储藏原子武器和氢武器，一贯支持劳动人民为这些目的而进行的斗争。
    但是裁军问题仍旧悬而未决，继续进行的扩充军备包藏着新战争的危险，并且引起通货膨胀、物价和赋税的增加以及人民生活水平的降低。
    因此，数以亿计的不同政治见解和宗教信仰的人都要求实际解决裁军问题，停止生产和试验原子武器和氢武器，销毁现有的原子弹和氢弹的储藏，裁减军费和把腾出的经费用于和平目的。
    决议说，各国人民的切身利益要求，一切工会组织消除它们之间的现有分歧，手挽手地共同争取解决裁军问题以及禁止生产、使用和试验原子武器和热核子武器的问题。
    世界工联理事会呼吁所有国际工会组织和各国工会组织以及各国劳动人民加紧努力，争取裁军，争取禁止原子武器和氢武器以及停止这类武器的试验，争取销毁原子弹和氢弹的储藏。
    决议说：只要我们一致行动，就能够而且一定会迅速地解决裁军问题以及为持久和平和提高各国人民的物质福利开辟一条道路。
