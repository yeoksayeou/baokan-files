Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: The academic conference in the capital commemorating the 20th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death continued today.

    Today's conference was presided over by Mao Dun, Zhou Yang, Lao She, and Zheng Zhenduo.

    The poet Zang Kejia gave a report entitled "Lu Xun's Contribution to Poetry." The writer Wang Yao gave a report entitled "On the Historical Connection between Lu Xun's Works and Classical Chinese Literature." When the literary theorist Chen Yong reported at the meeting, he made some supplements and elaborations to his article "Lu Xun's Struggle for Realism in Literature and Art." The paper "Artistic Features of Lu Xun's Essays" by writer Tang Tao (now in Shanghai) was also read at the conference.

    Czech writer Běla Křepelková, who was invited to Beijing, also gave a report entitled "Lu Xun and His Wild Grass Collection" at the conference.

    German writer Munz Dok and Guatemalan writer Asturias, who only arrived in Beijing on the 20th and missed the commemorative meeting for the 20th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death, also spoke at the conference.

    Munz Dok said that the socialist realism literature of great writers such as Gorky and Lu Xun awakened the sleepers to meet the storm that would change the world. Lu Xun succeeded in combining art and struggle, creating new Chinese literature. He paid tribute to this memorial meeting on behalf of his divided, but indivisible, country.

    Asturias said: Latin American writers have learned from Lu Xun's works. Now, Lu Xun's works are being successively passed into the hands of workers and young people. The Ah Q he created has transcended national boundaries, allowing us to see clearly that "Ah Q-ism" can only hinder our struggle against the oppressors. He concluded by saying that it was especially gratifying to have the opportunity to participate in this commemorative event.

    More than 500 writers, scholars, and people from all walks of life attended today's conference.

    This academic conference has now concluded.

    新华社22日讯　首都纪念鲁迅先生逝世二十周年的学术报告会今日继续举行。

    诗人臧克家作了题为“鲁迅对诗歌的贡献”的报告。作家王瑶作了题为“论鲁迅作品与中国古典文学的历史联系”的报告。文艺理论家陈涌在会上报告时，就他所写的
  “为文学艺术的现实主义而斗争的鲁迅”一文做了若干补充和发挥。报告会上并且宣读了作家唐弢（现在上海）的论文：“鲁迅杂文的艺术特征”。
    应邀来京的捷克斯洛伐克作家别尔查·克列布索娃也在会上作了题为“鲁迅和他的野草集”的报告。
    20日才赶到北京，未及参加鲁迅先生逝世二十周年纪念大会的德国作家蒙兹多克和危地马拉作家阿斯德里亚斯也在会上讲话。
    蒙兹多克讲话说，高尔基和鲁迅等伟大作家的社会主义现实主义文学，把沉睡者唤醒，来迎接改变世界的暴风雨。鲁迅做到了把艺术和斗争结合起来，创造了中国的新文学。他代表他的被分裂的、但又不能分裂的祖国向这次纪念大会致敬。
    阿斯德里亚斯讲话说：拉丁美洲作家从鲁迅作品中获得了教益。现在，鲁迅的著作正在陆续传到工人和青年们的手里。他所创造的阿Q已经超越了国界，让我们看清楚“阿Q主义”只能妨碍我们对压迫者的斗争。他最后说，能够有机会参加这次纪念活动是特别令人高兴的。
