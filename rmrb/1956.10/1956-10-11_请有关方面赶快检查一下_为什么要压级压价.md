    Please Urgently Check Why Grades are Being Lowered and Prices Suppressed

    On September 15th this year, our Jingqun Agricultural Cooperative of Xinshi Township sold over 160 jin of cotton to the Dongyang Cotton Purchasing Station in Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, and it was graded as lower grade. On September 17th, we sold another 170 jin of cotton to the same station, and it was graded as next lower grade. We felt that the quality of the cotton sold the second time was better than the first, yet the grade was lower. We asked the comrade responsible for grading to provide a standard sample for comparison. Upon comparison, our cotton, regardless of color or fiber length, was superior to the standard sample. However, the comrade responsible for grading said that their sample was old cotton, processed by a wooden gin, and still the standard was higher, insisting on classifying it as next lower grade. We find this very strange: if the sample cannot be used as a standard, what is the grader basing their work on?

    On the 25th, the medium-staple cotton sold by our cooperative and neighboring cooperatives was still graded as lower and next lower grades. In reality, our cotton this year has not suffered any disasters, and the quality is much better than last year. Why is the cotton grade lower than last year? Is it that the cotton is genuinely not good this year? Or has the national purchase standard been raised? Or is the Dongyang Purchasing Station intentionally lowering grades and suppressing prices?

    This practice by the Dongyang Cotton Purchasing Station may disrupt our cooperative's distribution plan and affect the dividends for members. We estimate that we can produce over 430,000 jin of ginned cotton. Originally, we planned to calculate based on the medium grade price (8 jiao per jin), which would be generally appropriate. However, based on the current selling situation, our cooperative will have a reduced income of over 4,300 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 3 jiao per labor day for each member. We usually strengthen business management, picking, removing petals, separating for drying, and storing separately, all to supply the state with good industrial raw materials. However, we are getting such results, severely dampening the labor enthusiasm of the members. Everyone is not cherishing the cotton anymore, believing that it won't be sold at a good grade anyway. We hope that relevant departments will quickly send someone to investigate and understand the situation, and make a fair decision to prevent things from continuing to go wrong and causing adverse consequences.　Wang Peiyu　Wang Peigui

    请有关方面赶快检查一下
    为什么要压级压价
    我们新市乡泾群农业社在今年9月15日卖给陕西省临潼县栋阳棉花采购站一百六十多斤棉花，验的是下级；17日又卖给该站一百七十多斤棉花，验的是次下级。我们觉得后一次卖的棉花质量比前一次卖的要好些，等级却比前一次低，就请负责验级的同志拿出标准样品来比较一下。一比较，我们的棉花无论色泽、绒长都比样品的标准高，可是负责验级的同志却说他们的样品是陈花，又是经木机轧过的，还是样品的标准高，仍坚持按次下级收。我们很奇怪：样品既然不能作为标准，验级员究竟是根据什么进行工作呢？
    25日我社和附近农业社所卖的中腰花仍被验为下级和次下级。实际上，我们这里今年的棉花未受任何灾害，今年棉花的品质要比去年好的多，为什么棉花的等级反而比去年低得多了呢？这究竟是今年的棉花真不好呢？还是国家收购标准提高了呢？还是栋阳采购站有意压级压价呢？
    栋阳棉花采购站的这种作法，很可能要打破我们社的分配计划，影响社员分红。我社估计可产皮棉四十三万余斤，原计划照中级价（每斤八角）计算，总的来说大体是合适的。但照现在的出卖情况来看，我们社就要减少收入四千三百余元，使每个劳动日降低三角。我们平时加强经营管理，拾花、挑瓣子、分晒、分存，就是为了给国家供应好的工业原料，然而却得到这样的结果，严重地打击了社员的劳动情绪，大家对棉花都不心疼了，认为反正卖不上好级。我们希望有关部门，赶快派人来调查了解，作一公正处理，以免继续错下去，招致不良后果。　王培玉　王培贵
