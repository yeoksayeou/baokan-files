　　Qinhuangdao Port is a well-known ice-free port in northern China, where ten-thousand-ton freighters can enter the port at any time without having to wait for the tide.

　　Through the green trees along the shore, the colored roofs of Qinhuangdao city, the huge chimneys of the factories, which constantly spew white smoke into the air, can be faintly seen; further away are the overlapping mountains at the foot of the Great Wall. The turquoise sea close to the pier sparkles with silver light; the waves constantly beat against the breakwater, churning up milky white waves. In this picturesque port, the staff of the port authority work diligently day and night.

　　We recently visited this port. That day, six ships were docked at the pier. Among them, four were from Japan and France, and two were from various ports in the motherland. With the development of the motherland's international trade, foreign ships are coming to Qinhuangdao Port with increasing frequency. From January of this year to now, ships from eight countries have traveled to and from this port, and the number of voyages has already exceeded the record for the entire year last year. They unload materials such as cement, rubber, and fertilizer here, and then load soybeans or coal to be transported to Japan, Pakistan... and other countries.

　　Six ships were loading and unloading at the same time, and the pier presented a busy scene. Five small trains raced back and forth on the lines from the freight yard to the pier, many belt conveyors were rumbling, and the ship's booms were constantly waving their long arms. The Japanese "Shinwa Maru" had just finished unloading cement and was starting to load coal again. In order to get the ships out of port ahead of schedule, the stevedores launched a fast loading and unloading competition.

　　Since the launch of the advanced producer movement this year, the staff of Qinhuangdao Port Authority have created seven advanced experiences in pier loading and unloading, such as "circular spreading of the slings" and "circular tamping of the cars." The 67th loading and unloading team, which was responsible for the loading and unloading task of the Japanese ship "Shinwa Maru," used to be relatively slow. Since learning the advanced experience of the 64th team's "one-time spreading of slings" method, and with the cooperation of the belt conveyor and the ship's boom, they completed the coal loading task sixteen hours ahead of schedule. Such loading and unloading efficiency surprised many sailors from capitalist countries. They asked, "How can your workers load and unload so fast? It's even faster than the ports in our country that use all-mechanical loading and unloading!" This is because Chinese workers are already the masters of their own country.

　　The dispatcher directing the pier loading and unloading that afternoon was Comrade Hao Fuzhen, a representative to the National Congress of Advanced Producers. Hao Fuzhen used to be a stevedore and was only promoted to dispatcher last year. His education level is low. Because of his diligent study of the business, he has become a very outstanding pier dispatcher. No matter which day he is on shift, he can keenly discover the weak links in the loading and unloading operation and come up with ways to break through them.

　　That day, he found that the unloading force of holds one and five of "Zhongxing No. 1" was insufficient. The other holds were almost unloaded, but these two holds had not unloaded half of the goods. He reallocated the forces and quickly balanced the unloading progress of each hold.

　　It was getting dark, seagulls swayed on the sea around the ship, and the starlight-like lights illuminated the pier as if it were daytime. The stevedores on the night shift continued to carry out loading and unloading work. The sound of the motors of the belt conveyors and cranes, the sound of workers operating, and the sound of train whistles merged together, like a majestic orchestra, playing a nocturne of glorious labor.

    秦皇岛港的日日夜夜
    何树田、关志诚
    秦皇岛港是我国有名的北方不冻良港，万吨巨轮不必赶潮便可以随时驶进港口。
    从港口透过岸边的绿树丛，隐约可见秦皇岛市内彩色的屋顶，工厂的巨大烟囱，在不断地向空中喷吐着白烟；再远，就是长城脚下重叠起伏的山峰。紧靠码头碧绿的海水，闪着片片银光；波浪不住地拍打着防坡堤，翻腾着乳白色的浪花。在这风景美丽如画的港口，港务局的职工们在日日夜夜地辛勤劳动着。
    最近我们访问了这个港口。这天，码头上停泊着六只轮船。其中有四只是来自日本和法国的，两只是来自祖国各港的。随着祖国国际贸易事业的发展，秦皇岛港的外轮往来日益频繁了。从今年1月到现在已有八个国家的船只来往于这个港口，来往的艘次，已经超过了去年全年的纪录。它们在这里卸下水泥、橡胶、肥田粉等物资，再装上大豆或煤炭，运往日本、巴基斯坦……等国去。
    六只轮船在同时装卸着，码头上呈现了一片繁忙的景象。五列小火车在货场至码头的线路上往来奔驰，好多台皮带输送机都在轰轰作响，船上的吊杆也在不停地挥动着长臂。日本“新和丸”号刚刚卸完水泥，又开始装煤炭了。装卸工人们为了使船舶提前出港，展开了快装、快卸竞赛。
    今年开展先进生产者运动以来，秦皇岛港务局的职工们已创造了“循环铺兜”、“循环捣车”等七种码头装卸的先进经验，担负日本轮“新和丸”装卸任务的第六十七装卸组，过去效率比较慢，自从学习了第六十四组的“一次铺兜法”的先进经验，加上皮带输送机和船上吊杆配合作业，提前十六个小时完成装煤任务。这样的装卸效率，使许多资本主义国家的船员都感到惊奇。他们问“你们这里的工人怎么装卸得那么快呀？比我们国家完全用机械装卸的港口还快得多呢！”这就是因为中国的工人已是自己国家的主人。
    这天下午指挥码头装卸的调度员，是全国先进生产者代表大会代表郝福祯同志。郝福祯从前是个装卸工人，去年才被提拔为调度员的，文化很低。由于他对业务刻苦钻研，已经成为一个非常出色的码头调度员。无论他在哪一天的班上，都能锐敏地发现装卸作业中的薄弱环节，并且想出办法来突破它。
    这天，他发现“中兴一号”一、五舱的卸货力量不足，别的舱都快卸完了，这两个舱还没有卸出一半货。他重新调配了力量，很快就使各舱的卸货进度平衡了。
    天黑了，海鸥荡漾在轮船周围的海面上，繁星般的灯光把码头照耀得如同白昼。值夜班的装卸工人们在继续进行着装卸工作，皮带输送机和吊车的马达声，工人操作声、火车的汽笛声汇合在一起，仿佛是一支雄壮的乐队，演奏着光荣劳动的夜曲。
