    County Party Secretary Song Lianfang
    Shao Qiong
    "An important hallmark of a good party member and a good leader lies in their familiarity with the people's living and working conditions, their concern for the people's suffering, and their understanding of the people's hearts; they adhere to a hard-working and simple style, sharing weal and woe with the people, able to accept the people's criticism and supervision, and not putting on any airs in front of the people; they consult with the masses on matters, and the masses are willing to talk to them."
    -- Political Report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Eighth National Congress
    Song Lianfang is the County Party Secretary of Zhenze County, Jiangsu Province. He has only been working in this county for more than two years, but the people of Zhenze are very familiar with him and know many things about him.
    Is it Wind Damage or Disease?
    Seeing the rice ears in the fields becoming fuller day by day, people talked more about County Party Secretary Song Lianfang, as intimately as they talked about partners working in the same field. After the strong typhoon in early August, the rice leaves suddenly turned yellow. At a cadre report meeting, County Party Secretary Song Lianfang asked everyone: "Why are the rice leaves turning yellow?" Some said it was because of too much fertilizer. Others said it was caused by the typhoon. The majority said it was caused by the typhoon.
    But the County Party Secretary disagreed. He always "gets to the bottom of things." He asked again, "Since everyone says it was caused by the typhoon, what is the wind damage situation? Has there been any investigation?" The meeting became silent, and people suddenly stopped volunteering to speak.
    Song Lianfang said: "I think we should go down and investigate to understand the situation before we talk."
    After the meeting, Song Lianfang, the Party Secretary of Hengjing District, and technicians from the Technology Extension Station went to investigate the cause of the yellowing rice leaves. They learned that the typhoon had passed ten days ago, and the rice had been growing well five days ago. The County Party Secretary carefully compared the yellowing rice plants, finding that some rice only had yellow tips, while others were yellow from root to tip. Based on the investigation, only a few rice plants had localized yellowing, and only a few in some rice paddies, while many were completely yellow, almost every field had them. Analyzing from these facts, it was certain that the localized yellowing was caused by the typhoon, and the overall yellowing was not caused by the typhoon, but by disease. Therefore, the county immediately took measures to prevent and control the disease in time. If this hadn't been investigated and studied, the disease would have been mistaken for wind damage, causing losses.
      The Person Who Jumped into the Water
    Song Lianfang came to Zhenze County in 1954. Shortly after he arrived, a major flood occurred, and a Xintang dike was washed away by the flood. Seeing more than 600 mu of rice, which was more than two feet tall, about to be swallowed by the flood, several cadres and the masses stood on the dike, unable to make a decision.
    Song Lianfang was originally planning to go to Xishan by boat to inspect the work. From afar, he saw a patch of green on the water, which he found strange. Because the cadres had reported that the dike could not be saved. Seeing the green, he estimated that it could still be saved, so he changed his mind and went ashore at Xintang dike instead of going to Xishan. People, hearing that he was the new County Party Secretary, couldn't help but secretly size him up. They saw the County Party Secretary carefully inspecting the breach and understanding the situation of the rice in the dike. He asked the cadres who couldn't make up their minds why they didn't block the breach and rescue the dike earlier. As he spoke, he jumped into the water with a splash, leading the masses to block the breach and fight the flood. The people who were still hesitant quickly followed him into the water when they saw the County Party Secretary jump in. The breach was washed bigger and bigger, and the people standing in the water could not stand firm due to the impact. The wooden stakes that had been driven in were pulled up by the water. The County Party Secretary had already been knocked down twice by the waves, and his face was pale. Everyone felt bad and advised the County Party Secretary to go ashore and rest, but he got up after falling and calmly directed the driving of stakes. He said: "The water is rushing fiercely, we can't drive the stakes straight down anymore, let's insert them diagonally from both ends, this can reduce the impact, we might as well try it." Everyone followed his method and inserted the stakes diagonally, and they were successfully driven in. Then the second stake, the third stake were driven in... People cheered.
    The dike was finally rescued from the water, the accumulated water was drained, and more than 200,000 jin of grain were harvested in the autumn. From that day on, the masses recognized the leader of the county through adversity.
      Barren Land Opened in the Sky
    One day, Zhu Changshuang, Deputy Party Secretary of the Eastern District Committee of the Communist Party of China, reported to County Party Secretary Song Lianfang: "After the flood in Duchaio Township in our district, we plan to open up wasteland for production and disaster relief. We have already opened up 40 mu." Song Lianfang planned to inform the whole county about the situation of production and disaster relief in Duchaio Township, so he asked him to accompany him to take a look.
    Zhu Changshuang led the County Party Secretary towards what the township cadres had reported as the area. The two people walked around on the slope several times, but not only did they not see the 40 mu of newly opened wasteland, but there wasn't even a hoe's worth of newly dug soil on the hillside. Zhu Changshuang said: "Maybe it's on the mountain." The two climbed up the mountain to look for it, but they still couldn't find it. Sweat was pouring down the Deputy District Party Secretary's head. The County Party Secretary said humorously: "Is it in the sky, perhaps?" Zhu Changshuang's face turned red instantly.
      "Comrade: A District Party Secretary cannot just listen to reports, but should also investigate and study more when encountering problems, and use your brains to think." Song Lianfang said seriously.
    From then on, the District Party Secretaries of various districts also began to learn the style of seeking truth from facts and conducting investigations and research when encountering problems.
      Wheat Yield Doubles
    This year's wheat yield in Zhenze County has more than doubled compared to last year, averaging 245 jin per mu. Not long ago, Zhenze County was still a low-yield wheat county in Jiangsu Province, but suddenly it leaped to become a high-yield county in the province.
    The County Party Secretary, when he first arrived, heard that the average wheat yield was only 70 jin per mu, and he simply didn't believe it. How could such good land only yield dozens of jin per mu? He was determined to change the backward state of wheat production. After the County Party Secretary's idea became a resolution of the County Party Committee, a series of tasks began, such as wheat yield surveys, surveys of high-yield households, and surveys of high-yield experiences.
    The County Party Secretary came to the Xiansheng Agricultural Cooperative and carefully investigated and summarized the cooperative's experience in high-yield wheat production. First, he discovered the problem of the width of the wheat rows. Their wheat rows were narrow, with many ditches, and only 60 to 70 percent of the land was used per mu; their wheat rows were wide, and after his measurement and calculation, the land utilization rate reached 80 to 90 percent. Others planted sparsely, while the Xiansheng cooperative planted densely. The County Party Secretary also personally conducted on-site investigations and calculations to determine the extent of the density. Others dug shallow ditches, while they dug deep ditches. Zhenze County is located beside mountains and lakes, and the groundwater level is very high. As the saying goes, "Wheat a foot tall fears water an inch deep." Shallow ditches do not drain well, and deep ditches drain quickly, so the water dries up after the rain stops. The wonderful thing is that the members of the Xiansheng Cooperative made the wheat ridges in the shape of a roof, which drained even faster.
    The secret of why the same land could not produce the same amount of grain was revealed. In the past, the farmers of this county copied the experience of planting wheat in highland areas, and did not implement cultivation techniques that were adapted to local conditions.
    Based on these on-site investigation materials, the County Party Secretary and his partners promoted the high-yield wheat techniques of wide ridges, dense planting, and deep ditches of the Xiansheng Cooperative throughout the county, and finally changed the backward state of wheat production in Zhenze County within two years.
      A Good Friend of the Cooperative Members
    When the reporter visited the County Party Secretary, he had already gone to the fields early in the morning. I asked the County Party Committee Secretary how to find the County Party Secretary. The secretary said:
  "Coincidentally, the County Party Committee is meeting these days, so he is at home. Otherwise, you can only find him at the agricultural cooperative. Many agricultural cooperative members often come to him and have become friends with him." As he was speaking, the County Party Secretary and a farmer walked in, enthusiastically discussing something. The farmer talking to the County Party Secretary was Shi Pinfang, a member of the Shengli Agricultural Cooperative in Duchaio Township. He rushed to the County Party Committee early in the morning to report to the County Party Secretary about the problems of undemocratic work style and suppression of criticism among the cadres of their cooperative. The secretary looked at me, his eyes seeming to say: How about it, I wasn't lying, was I!

    县委书记宋莲芳
    邵琼
    “一个好党员、一个好领导者的重要标志，在于他熟悉人民的生活状况和劳动状况，关心人民的痛痒，懂得人民的心；他坚持艰苦朴素的作风，同人民同甘苦共患难，能够接受人民的批评监督，不在人民面前摆任何架子；他有事找群众商量，群众有话也愿意同他说。”
    ——中国共产党中央委员会向第八次全国代表大会的政治报告
    宋莲芳是江苏省震泽县的县委书记，他到这个县工作才两年多，但震泽人却很熟悉他，了解有关他的许多事情。
    是风害还是病害
    眼看田里的稻穗儿一天比一天丰腴，人们更多地谈论县委书记宋莲芳，就像谈论同一块田里干活的伙伴一样亲切。今年8月初强台风过境以后，稻叶子突然发黄了，县委书记宋莲芳在干部汇报会上问大家：“稻叶子为什么发黄？”有人说是因为肥料垩得太多。有人说是被台风刮的。说台风刮的人占多数。
    但是这位县委书记却不以为然，他一向是“打破沙锅问到底”的人，又问：“既然大家都说是因为台风刮的，风害情况怎么样？有没有作过调查？”会场上一片沉默，发言突然不踊跃了。
    宋莲芳说：“我看还是下去调查了解了再说。”
    会后，宋莲芳和横泾区区委书记、还有技术推广站的技术员等人一起去调查稻叶子发黄的原因。他们了解到台风是十天以前过境的，而稻子在五天以前还长得好好的。县委书记把叶子发黄的稻拔起来仔细比较，发现有的稻只是叶梢局部发黄，有的稻从根到梢全部发黄。再根据调查的情况分析，局部发黄的稻很少，有的稻田里只有个别的几株，而全株发黄的却很多，几乎块块田都有。从这些实际情况分析，肯定局部发黄的是台风刮的，全株发黄的不是台风刮的，是生病了。于是，县委立即采取措施，及时防治。如果这次不是经过调查研究，就会把病害当成风害，造成损失。
      跳到水里的人
    宋莲芳是1954年到震泽县来的，他到震泽县不久就发生大水，有一个新塘圩被大水冲倒了。眼看六百多亩两尺多高的稻子快被洪水吞没了，几个干部和群众站在圩堤上拿不定主意。
    宋莲芳乘轮船原来打算到西山去检查工作，老远地看到这里水面上还冒出一片青来，他很奇怪。因为干部在汇报时说这个圩子已经不能抢救了。他看到青色，估计还可以抢救，就改变主张不去西山而在新塘圩上了岸。人们听说是新来的县委书记，都不由偷偷地打量他，只见县委书记仔细地检查决口，了解圩里稻子的情况。他问那几个拿不定主意的干部，为什么不趁早堵口抢救。说着，他扑通一声跳到水里，带领群众堵口抢险。本来还迟疑犹豫的人看到县委书记跳下水了，他们也赶快跟下去。决口越冲越大，站在水里的人被冲击得站不住，打好的木桩又叫水给拔了起来。县委书记已经给浪打倒了两次，他的脸苍白。大家过意不去，劝县委书记上岸歇歇，但他跌倒了爬起来，还是沉着地指挥打桩。他说：“水冲得凶，我们不能再直线下桩了，从两头斜插下去，这样可以减少冲力，不妨试试看。”大家照他的办法斜插下去，果然插住了，接着第二根、第三根插下去……人们欢呼起来。
    塘圩终于从水里抢救出来，排干了积水，秋收时收到了二十多万斤粮食。就是从这天起，群众从患难之中认识了这个县的领导人。
      荒地开在天上
    有一天，中共东山区区委副书记朱长双向县委书记宋莲芳汇报说：“我区渡桥乡水灾以后，打算开荒生产救灾，已经开好了四十亩。”宋莲芳打算把渡桥乡的生产救灾情况通报全县，就请他陪着去看看。
    朱长双领着县委书记朝乡干部汇报中所说的那块走去，两个人在坡上走了几个圈，不但没有看到四十亩新开的荒地，山坡上连一锄新挖的土也没有。朱长双说：大概在山上。两人又爬到山上去找，找来找去还是找不到。区委副书记头上直冒汗。县委书记幽默地说：“难道在天上吗？”朱长双的脸刷地一下红了。
      “同志：做一个区委书记不能光听汇报，遇事还要多作调查，开动脑筋想想。”宋莲芳严肃地说。
    从此，各个区的区委书记也开始学习实事求是、遇事调查研究的作风了。
      小麦增产一倍
    震泽县今年小麦比去年增产一倍以上，平均每亩产二百四十五斤。曾几何时，震泽县还是江苏省小麦低产县，忽然飞跃地变为全省的小麦高额丰产县。
    县委书记才来那年，听说小麦平均每亩只产七十斤，他简直不相信。怎么这里这样好的土地，一亩只收几十斤。他决心要改变小麦生产上的落后状况。当县委书记的想法变成县委会的决议以后，小麦产量调查、丰产户的调查、丰产经验的调查等一系列的工作开始了。
    县委书记来到了宪生农业社，仔细地调查总结了这个社小麦丰产的经验。首先发现麦垅的宽狭问题，人家麦垅是狭的，沟很多，一亩土地只利用了六、七分；这个社的麦垅是阔的，经他测量计算，土地的利用率达到了百分之八十到九十。人家稀植，宪生社密植，密到什么程度，县委书记也亲自实地调查计算过。人家开的是浅沟，这个社开的是深沟。震泽县傍山滨湖，地下水位很高，所谓“尺麦怕寸水”，浅沟排水不畅快，沟开得深，排水快，雨停水也干了。妙的是宪生社社员把麦垅做成屋脊形，排起水来就更快当。
    同样的土地为什么打不出同样数量粮食的秘密被揭开了。这个县的农民过去照搬高田地区种麦的经验，没有实行因地制宜的耕种技术。
    县委书记和他的伙伴们，根据这些实地调查的材料，在全县范围内推广了宪生社的阔垅、密植、深沟等小麦增产技术，在两年时间内，终于改变了震泽县小麦生产的落后状况。
      社员的好朋友
    记者访问县委书记时，他一早就下田去了，我向县委会秘书打听怎样才能找到县委书记，秘书说：
  “碰巧，这两天开县委会，他在家，否则，要找他只有到农业社去找。有许多农业社社员常来找他，跟他成了朋友。”正说着，县委书记和一个农民在热烈地谈论着什么走进来。同县委书记谈话的农民施品方，是渡桥乡胜利农业社的社员，他一早赶到县委会，来找县委书记反映他们社的干部作风不民主、压制批评等问题。秘书看着我，那眼光像在说：如何，我说的不假吧！
