Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, October 25th. Hydrological surveying personnel have confirmed that the hydropower potential of the Lei River, Chunling River, and Mi River, all tributaries of the Xiang River in Hunan Province, exceeds 700,000 kilowatts.

	These three rivers are all located in the southern Hunan region. The upper reaches of the rivers are mostly towering mountains and steep valleys, with rapid currents and large drops and volumes of water. For example, the famous "Three Shoals and Twelve Waves" along the Lei River is an ideal dam site. Southern Hunan is rich in metallic mineral resources such as iron, manganese, and tungsten. In the future, the utilization of water resources will not only facilitate irrigation and navigation but also create important conditions for the development of these minerals.

    湘南水力资源丰富
    新华社长沙25日电　经过水力勘查人员的查勘证实，湖南省湘江支流——耒水、舂陵水、洣水的水力蕴藏量达七十万瓩以上。
    这三条河流都在湘南地区。河流的上游大都是崇山峻岭，水流湍急，落差和水量都很大。如耒水沿河有名的三滩十二浪，就是一个很理想的水坝地址。湘南地区铁、锰、钨等金属矿产丰富。将来水力资源被利用起来以后，不但灌溉、航运便利，而且可以为开发这些矿产创造重要条件。
