Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: One hundred and forty-six elementary schools specially established for children of minority herdsmen in the pastoral areas of Qinghai Province have begun classes. In addition, fifty-four ordinary elementary schools have also enrolled many minority students. The total number of students has reached 12,000, an increase of 50% over the previous school year.

These schools are adapted to the characteristics of pastoral production. Some have fixed school buildings, some are set up in easily movable tents, and some schools live in earthen houses in the winter and spring, and live in tents to adapt to nomadism in the summer and autumn.

A number of graduates have already emerged from these ethnic elementary schools. Some are continuing their studies at central or local ethnic institutes, some have become cadres in the autonomous organs of their own ethnic groups, and some have participated in the development of the Qaidam Basin.

    青海牧区民族小学发展很快
    据新华社讯　青海省牧业区专为少数民族牧民儿童设立的一百四十六所小学已经开学，另外五十四所普通小学也招收了许多少数民族学生。学生总数达到一万二千人，比上学年增加了50％。
    这些学校都适应牧区生产特点，有的有固定的校舍，有的设立在便于移动的帐棚里，有的学校冬春两季住土房，夏秋两季适应游牧住帐棚。
    在这些民族小学中已经有一批毕业生，他们有的在中央或地方的民族学院继续学习，有的当了本民族自治政权机关的干部，有的参加了柴达木盆地的开发工作。
