    A Political Conspiracy
    Just as our sports circles are actively preparing to participate in the 16th Olympic Games, we have heard some very surprising news. According to reports, in addition to the People's Republic of China delegation, the International Olympic Committee has also invited sports organizations from Taiwan Province of our country to participate in the Games; at the same time, it intends to take measures at this Games that insult our national dignity, calling Taiwan "Formosa China" and unilaterally changing the name of the People's Republic of China to "Beijing China." Not only that, but the International Olympic Committee recently openly accepted the so-called protest of the Taiwan Kuomintang group and is preparing to discuss the issue of China notifying Taiwan athletes to participate in national selection trials at the Melbourne plenary meeting. The Chinese people cannot but express great indignation and protest against these practices of artificially dividing China and undermining China's dignity.
    The International Olympic Committee has always believed that a country can only have one National Olympic Committee and that a country should only have one delegation participating in the Olympic Games. However, it is now attempting to violate its own principles by inviting a local sports organization in our country to participate in the Olympic Games under the guise of representing the entire country, and even unreasonably attempting to arbitrarily alter the sacred national name of the People's Republic of China, and creating a "Formosa China" name that no one has ever heard of before. It is difficult for people to understand why the International Olympic Committee is taking such absurd actions. This cannot but give people reason to suspect that certain responsible individuals on this committee are being influenced or manipulated by international forces attempting to seize or divide our territory of Taiwan, and are attempting to drag this international sports organization into their political conspiracy to create so-called "two Chinas."
    However, any international force that attempts to create the delusion of "two Chinas" in any situation or in any way is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people, and it is absolutely impossible to realize. Our Premier Zhou Enlai once solemnly pointed out: "This kind of delusion can only be regarded as a manifestation of losing one's mind in the face of powerful reality."
    There is only one China on earth. Taiwan is a province of China. Taiwan has been Chinese territory for more than a thousand years. International agreements such as the Cairo Declaration during World War II clearly stipulated that Taiwan must be returned to China. Taiwan has been returned to China since the Japanese surrender. Taiwan athletes have participated in China's National Games as a provincial representative team. Therefore, it is a matter of course for our Olympic Committee to notify Taiwan athletes to participate in the national selection trials, and no one has the right to interfere. Chiang Kai-shek's elements are obstructing Taiwan athletes from participating in the national selection trials and making a so-called protest to the International Olympic Committee under the stolen name of China. This is simply making trouble out of nothing. The International Olympic Committee should reject this nonsense instead of interfering in our internal affairs and discussing the issue of our selection of athletes.
    The current situation in the Taiwan region is caused by the United States' aggressive policy of attempting to occupy our Taiwan for a long time. This situation is bound to change, because 600 million Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan, and the eight million compatriots in Taiwan are also looking forward to returning to the embrace of the motherland day and night. The aggressive policy of the United States occupying our territory Taiwan and using the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan to exclude the People's Republic of China from its legitimate position in many international organizations is now becoming increasingly unpopular and is being met with increasingly strong opposition around the world. Under this increasingly unfavorable situation, the United States is stepping up its conspiracy to create the so-called "two Chinas," attempting to use this conspiracy to cover up its aggressive actions of occupying our territory Taiwan and to legalize this aggressive action. Now some people are even trying to turn an international sports organization into a tool for them to play with the political conspiracy of the so-called "two Chinas," which the Chinese people absolutely cannot allow.
    The Chinese people believe that if the International Olympic Committee allows the manipulation of some people with ulterior motives, and accepts other organizations that falsely claim to represent China in addition to the delegation of the People's Republic of China to participate in this Games, or takes insulting actions against the delegation of the People's Republic of China, this is not only an unfriendly expression towards the 600 million Chinese people and Chinese sports circles, but also a most serious damage to the International Olympic Committee's own credibility and to the atmosphere of friendly cooperation in sports circles of all countries. The Chinese people demand that the International Olympic Committee reject the so-called "Formosa China" sports delegation that does not exist in the world, and immediately stop all plans to interfere in our internal affairs or undermine the dignity of the delegation of the People's Republic of China.

### 一个政治阴谋

    一个政治阴谋
    正当我国体育界积极筹备参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会的时候，我们听到了一些令人十分惊讶的消息。据报道，国际奥林匹克委员会在中华人民共和国代表队之外，还邀请了我国台湾省的体育组织参加本届运动会；同时，它打算在这次运动会上采取侮辱我国尊严的措施，把台湾叫做“福摩萨中国”，而把中华人民共和国国名擅自改称为“北京中国”。不但如此，国际奥林匹克委员会最近还公然接受台湾国民党集团的所谓抗议，准备在墨尔本全体会议上讨论中国通知台湾运动员参加全国选拔赛的问题。对于这些人为地分裂中国和损害中国尊严的作法，中国人民不能不表示极大的愤慨和抗议。
    国际奥林匹克委员会一向认为，一个国家只能有一个国家奥林匹克委员会和一个国家只应有一个代表队参加奥林匹克运动会。但是，它现在却企图违反自己的原则而邀请我国的一个地方性的体育组织，假冒全国的名义去参加奥林匹克运动会，甚至无理到企图随意窜改中华人民共和国神圣的国名，而且创立一个古今中外谁也没有听说过的什么“福摩萨中国”的名义。人们很难理解国际奥林匹克委员会为什么要采取这种荒唐的行动。这不能不使人有理由怀疑这个委员会中的某些负责人士，是受到了那些企图强占或分裂我国领土台湾的国际势力的影响或操纵，企图把这个国际体育组织卷进到它们所欲制造的所谓“两个中国”的政治阴谋中去。
    但是，任何国际势力在任何场合采用任何方式企图制造“两个中国”的妄想，都是中国人民所绝对不能容许的，也是绝对不可能实现的。我国周恩来总理曾经严正地指出过：“这种妄想只能被认为是在强大的现实面前丧失了理智的表现。”
    地球上只有一个中国。台湾是中国的一个省。台湾成为中国的领土已有一千多年的历史。第二次世界大战期间的开罗宣言等国际协定，都明确地规定了台湾必须归还中国。在日本投降以后，台湾已经归还中国。台湾的运动员曾经以一个省区代表队的身份参加过中国的全国运动会。因此，我国奥林匹克委员会通知台湾的运动员参加全国性的选拔赛，这是天经地义的事，任何人都无权干涉。蒋介石分子阻挠台湾运动员参加全国选拔赛，并且盗用中国名义向国际奥林匹克委员会提出所谓抗议，这简直是无理取闹。国际奥林匹克委员会理应拒绝这种胡闹，而不应干涉我国的内部事务，讨论关于我国选拔运动员的问题。
    台湾地区目前的形势，是美国企图长期侵占我国台湾的侵略政策所造成的。这种形势是一定要改变的，因为六万万中国人民决心要解放台湾，台湾的八百万同胞也日夕盼望着回到祖国的怀抱。美国强占我国领土台湾，并且利用台湾的蒋介石集团来排斥中华人民共和国在许多国际组织中的合法地位的侵略政策，现在已经日益不得人心，并且在全世界遭到愈来愈强烈的反对。在这种愈来愈不利的形势下，美国就加紧制造所谓“两个中国”的阴谋，想用这种阴谋来掩盖它霸占我国领土台湾的侵略行动，并使这个侵略行动合法化。现在竟有人企图把一个国际体育组织也变成它们玩弄所谓“两个中国”的政治阴谋的工具，这是中国人民绝对不能容许的。
    中国人民认为，国际奥林匹克委员会如果容许某些别有用心的人的操纵，在中华人民共和国代表队之外还接纳别的假冒中国名义的组织参加这次运动会，或者对中华人民共和国代表队采取侮辱性行动，这不但是对六亿中国人民和中国体育界的不友好的表示，而且是对国际奥林匹克委员会自己的信誉以及对各国体育界友好合作的气氛的一种最严重的损害。中国人民要求国际奥林匹克委员会摈斥在世界上并不存在的所谓“福摩萨中国”的体育代表队，并且立即停止一切有关干涉我国内政或有损中华人民共和国代表队的尊严的打算。
