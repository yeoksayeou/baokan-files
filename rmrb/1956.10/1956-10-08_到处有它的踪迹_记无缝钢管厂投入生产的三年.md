    Everywhere There Are Traces of It
    —Remembering the Three Years of Seamless Steel Tube Plant's Operation
　　By Our Correspondent　Yuan Liang
    Not long ago, I made a very interesting visit—to trace the whereabouts of seamless steel tubes.
    Director Liu of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant said meaningfully: “Three years ago, when we were building the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, the people of the whole country supported it. It was really like some people said: ‘Talents come from the East, West, North and South; materials are sent from all directions.’ Now, the Seamless Steel Tube Plant is supporting the whole country, and some people are now describing it: ‘Seamless steel tubes have long legs, and their traces are everywhere in the country.’”
    Since October 27, 1953, when the Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Plant officially went into production, the more than four hundred specifications of products it has produced, converted into medium-sized tubes, when connected, form a line more than 1,400 kilometers long. If a chart were used to show the whereabouts of seamless steel tubes, then, with Anshan as the center, more than 1,300 arrows radiating to all parts of the country would have to be drawn.
    At the Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, Chief Engineer Wang Chenglie led me to the locomotive repair workshop. The workshop was filled with many locomotive boilers like giant beasts, and a 冖ㄎtwo locomotive boiler was being overhauled. Its belly was filled with slender tubes. Chief Engineer Wang said to me: “There are a total of two hundred and forty-five tubes, each 5.75 meters long, all of which are seamless steel tubes—we call them the heart of the locomotive.” He explained: “The tubes pass through the boiler, with fire inside and water outside. This is how the water is turned into power—steam—to propel the locomotive forward. Think about it: if it weren’t for them, wouldn't the train's pulse stop beating?"
    "Before 1952, the most troublesome thing for us was the lack of seamless steel tubes," said Chief Engineer Wang. "At that time, there were few imports from abroad, and domestic production was nonexistent. We had to piece together some uneven tube heads, which naturally affected the quality. As a result, the repaired locomotives could not run 300,000 kilometers before they had to re-enter the 'hospital'. Now, the operating efficiency of the locomotives we repair has reached 420,000 kilometers. This is because we have seamless steel tubes from Anshan Iron and Steel.”
    At the Anshan Chemical Engineering Company, someone told me that the Anshan Iron and Steel Chemical Plant, which was expanded in 1955, was constructed by them. One of the recovery workshops alone used more than 11,000 meters of seamless steel tubes. Another tar workshop is a key project in the renovation of the chemical plant. Originally, five distillation kettles left by the Japanese were used here. This outdated equipment not only fell far short of meeting the needs of other workshops, but also seriously threatened the health and safety of employees. A technician in the tar workshop of the chemical plant described the situation at the time: "Broken pots leak oil, the ground is dirty, and the air is turbid and smelly." What was most worrying was that it was easy to cause a fire. At the end of 1954 and the beginning of 1955, there were two fires in the tar workshop, which were fortunately extinguished in time, otherwise there would have been a danger of explosion in the entire factory. Now, the distillation kettles have been replaced by tubular furnaces. After using tubular furnaces, the workshop is cleaner, the danger of fire is eliminated, and the output of one furnace is more than twice that of the previous five distillation kettles.
    Speaking of the construction of tubular furnaces, the comrades in the coking coal section of the Anshan Iron and Steel Equipment Department said: "The employees of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant put in a lot of effort!" Originally, this tubular furnace was designed abroad, and the construction drawings required the use of an alloy seamless steel tube. At that time, this alloy steel was not yet produced in China. When contacting the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union was still in the trial production stage. Later, after research by many Soviet experts, the design was changed, and another alloy steel was used instead and handed over to the Seamless Steel Tube Plant for trial rolling. The employees of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant repeatedly studied and adopted the method of twice piercing the core, and finally succeeded in trial rolling. However, because the steel was relatively brittle, the rolled steel tubes needed to be annealed, but there was no suitable annealing equipment in Anshan. Workers, engineers, and Soviet experts took these tubes to Shenyang for annealing, which ensured the needs of the tar workshop renovation project.
    Three years ago, I saw workers on the Tianlan Railway construction site, with one person holding a steel drill and two people wielding sledgehammers, chiseling blastholes in the rock with a "ding-ding-dang-dang" sound, and it took them a long time to chisel out a single blasthole. In the Aganzhen Coal Mine, the miners still used sharp picks to pry pieces of coal seams as hard as rocks. At that time, it felt a little novel to occasionally see workers carrying a "putu-putu" sounding thing on their shoulders at the tunnel construction site, which could drill a blasthole in a few minutes. Later, I learned that it was called a pneumatic pick. Now, pneumatic picks are no longer a rare thing. Everyone knows that this is because China has pneumatic tool manufacturing plants. The power of pneumatic tools is wind. Where does the wind come from? This leads us to the air compressor.
    Comrades from the Shenyang Air Compressor Plant told me that some of the air compressors they now produce have a displacement of 40 cubic meters per minute, reaching eight atmospheres. The air it discharges has a temperature of about 100 degrees Celsius. Without high-pressure and high-temperature resistant seamless steel tubes for intake and exhaust pipes, it would be impossible to produce air compressors. Since 1954, Anshan Iron and Steel's seamless steel tubes have been supplied in large quantities, and Shenyang Air Compressor's production has had the most reliable source of materials.
    Comrades from the Anshan Iron and Steel Sales Department provided me with more clues about the whereabouts of seamless steel tubes. They said: In just a few months of this year, the length of seamless steel tubes sent from Anshan Iron and Steel to the exploration teams under the Central Geological Department reached 360,000 meters. In the past few years, the geological tubes produced by the Seamless Steel Tube Plant can be used to assemble more than 1,000 drilling rigs, allowing our geological pioneers to explore the secrets of the earth in the vast fields of the motherland.
    Of course, it is impossible to visit more than 1,000 production and construction units across the country that use seamless steel tubes. Let me describe the growth of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant in the past three years! Mastering a steel rolling mill equipped with the latest technology like the Seamless Steel Tube Plant presented many difficulties for our technicians and workers. At that time, there were a total of eighteen Soviet experts in the factory. They taught the workers operating methods and explained technical knowledge by holding their hands. By the second half of 1954, the majority of employees had mastered this new type of factory.
    In October of that year, all the experts left the factory and returned to their country. The problem facing the factory was no longer just barely rolling out seventeen specifications of tubes, but the need to solve various new problems encountered in the production process, and to further improve quality and increase variety. At that time, the phenomenon of internal folding (creases in the inner skin of the tube) was serious, accounting for 4.05% of the output, resulting in a large number of substandard and defective products. What was the reason? No one could explain the reason. After repeated research and experiments by the employees, they finally found the problem in the operation of the heating furnace and also discovered good experiences.
    Now, the quality index of seamless steel tubes has gradually increased from 92.21% in 1954 to 94.86% in 1956 (the state plan is 93.51%), and the convergence rate (how much steel should be rolled out from one ton of steel billet) has increased from 87.41% in 1954 to the current 91.6% (the state plan is 90.63%). The variety of specifications has increased from five outer diameters and seventeen wall thicknesses in 1954 to the current forty-one outer diameters and four hundred and thirty-nine wall thicknesses. Moreover, the technology has exceeded the design standards, and some small-diameter and large-diameter steel tubes not specified in the design book have also been rolled out to supply the needs of national construction as much as possible.
    In the past, the whole country supported Anshan Iron and Steel. Now, Anshan Iron and Steel is vigorously supporting the whole country.

    到处有它的踪迹
    ——记无缝钢管厂投入生产的三年
　　本报记者　袁良
    不久以前，我作了一次很有意思的访问——去追寻无缝钢管的踪迹。
    无缝钢管厂的刘厂长意味深长地说：“三年前，当我们建设无缝钢管厂的时候，全国人民都支援它，真是像有些人说的：“东西南北来人材，四面八方送物资。”现在，无缝钢管厂支援着全国，又有人这样描绘：“无缝钢管腿儿长，全国到处有踪迹”。
    从1953年10月27日，鞍钢无缝钢管厂正式投入生产以来，它所生产的四百多种规格的产品，换算为中等管子，连接起来，就是一根一千四百多公里的长线。如果用图表来显示无缝钢管的行踪，那么，以鞍山作中心，辐射到全国各地的箭头，就得涂上一千三百多根。
    在沈阳机车车辆修理工厂，总工程师王承烈领我到机车修理车间去。车间里横卧着许多像巨兽一样的机车锅炉，一台冖ㄎ二机车锅炉正在检修。它的肚子里塞满了细长的管子。王总工程师对我说：“一共是二百四十五根，每根长五点七五公尺，都是无缝钢管——我们称它是机车的心脏。”他解释道：“管子在锅炉里穿过，里面是火，外面是水。这才能把水变成动力——蒸汽，推动机车前进。你想想：倘若没有它，火车的脉搏不是就要停止跳动吗？”
    “一九五二年以前，我们最伤脑筋的是缺少无缝钢管。”王总工程师说：“那时候，国外进货少，国内不生产。我们不得不东拼西凑，把一些粗细不匀的管子头焊到一起，这自然要影响质量。结果，修出来的机车跑不出三十万公里，就要重进‘医院’。现在，我们修的机车，运行效率已经达到四十二万公里了。这就是因为有了鞍钢的无缝钢管。”
    在鞍山化工工程公司，有人告诉我，1955年扩建的鞍钢化工总厂，就是由他们施工的。仅其中一个回收车间，就用了一万一千多公尺长的无缝钢管。另一个焦油车间，是化工总厂改建的一个关键工程。这里原来是使用日本人留下的五个蒸馏釜，这种陈旧的设备，不仅远远不能满足其他车间的需要，而且严重威胁着职工的健康和安全。化工总厂焦油车间的一位技术员，这样描绘当时的情景：“破锅漏油满地脏，空气混浊臭难当。”而最令人担心的是很容易引起火灾。1954年年底、1955年年初，焦油车间曾经起过两次火，幸而被及时扑灭了，不然就有引起全厂爆炸的危险。现在，蒸馏釜已经让位了，代替它的是管式炉。使用管式炉后，车间里清洁了，火灾的危险消除了，一个炉子比过去五个蒸馏釜的产量还高出一倍多。
    谈起管式炉的修筑，鞍钢设备处焦化科的同志们说：“无缝钢管厂的职工可费了大劲啦！”原来这种管式炉是国外设计的，施工图上要求使用一种合金无缝钢管。那时，这种合金钢国内还不生产，向苏联联系，苏联也还在试制。后来经过许多苏联专家研究，改变了设计，用另一种合金钢来代替，交给无缝钢管厂试轧。无缝钢管厂的职工反复研究，采用两次穿心的方法，终于试轧成功。但由于钢质比较脆，轧出来的钢管需要退火，鞍山却没有合适的退火设备。工人、工程师和苏联专家又带着这批管子到沈阳去退火，才保证了焦油车间改建工程的需要。
    还是三年以前，我在天兰铁路工地上，曾经看到过工人们一人扶着钢钎，两人抡着大锤，叮叮噹噹地在岩石上开凿炮眼，半天工夫也凿不出一个炮眼来。在阿干镇煤矿，矿工们还是用尖镢，一块块地撬动像岩石一样坚硬的煤层。那时候，在隧道工地上偶尔见到工人们用肩膀抗着一个突突作响的东西，几分钟就能钻出一个炮眼，还觉得有些新奇。以后才知道那就叫作风镐。现在，风镐已经不是什么稀奇的东西了。谁都知道，这是由于我国有了风动工具制造厂。风动工具的动力是风。风从何处来？这就不得不谈到空气压缩机。
    沈阳空气压缩机厂的同志们告诉我，他们现在生产的空气压缩机，有的每分钟有四十个排气量，达到八个大气压。它排出的气，温度在摄氏一百度左右。没有耐高压，和耐高温的无缝钢管来作进气管和排气管，便无法生产空气压缩机。从1954年起，鞍钢的无缝钢管大量供应，沈阳空气压缩机的生产才有了最可靠的材料来源。
    鞍钢供销处的同志们向我提供了更多的无缝钢管行迹的线索。他们说：单单今年的几个月内，由鞍钢送到中央地质部所属勘探队的无缝钢管，长度即达三十六万公尺。几年来无缝钢管厂生产的地质管，足足可以装配一千多台钻机，让我们的地质尖兵们，在祖国辽阔的原野上探询着大地的秘密。
    要拜访全国一千多个使用无缝钢管的生产和建设单位，当然不可能。让我叙述一下三年来无缝钢管厂的成长吧！掌握像无缝钢管厂这样用最新技术装备起来的轧钢厂，对我国的技术人员和工人来说，是有很多困难的。当时，这个厂共有十八位苏联专家，他们把着工人的手传授操作方法，讲解技术知识。到了1954年下半年度，广大的职工就掌握了这个新型的工厂。
    那年十月，专家们全部离厂回国了。厂子里面临的问题不再是凑合着轧出十七种规格的管材，而是需要解决生产过程中所遇到的各种新的问题，并进一步提高质量，增加品种。当时内折叠（管子内皮绉折）现象严重，占到产量的4.05％，造成大量次品、废品。究竟是什么原因呢？谁也讲不出道理。经过职工反复进行研究、试验，最后找到加热炉操作上的毛病，也发现了好的经验。
    现在无缝钢管的质量指标，已由1954年的92.21％，逐年提高到1956年的94.86％（国家计划是93.51％），收合率（一吨钢坯应轧出多少钢材）已由1954年的87.41％提高到目前的91.6％（国家计划是90.63％），品种规格已由1954年的五种外径，十七种壁厚，增加至今年的四十一种外径，四百三十九种壁厚，而且在技术上已经超出了设计标准，还轧制出一些设计书里没有规定的小口径和大口径钢管，来尽可能地供应国家建设的需要。
    过去，全国支援了鞍钢，现在，鞍钢正在大力支援全国。
