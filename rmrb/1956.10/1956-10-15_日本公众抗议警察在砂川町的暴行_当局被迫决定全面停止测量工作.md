Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: News: Approximately four thousand people, including members of the Japanese Socialist Party, workers, and students, held a mass rally in Sunagawa Town today, protesting the bloodshed caused by the Japanese police during the forced surveying of Sunagawa Town residents' land.

    Those participating in the rally unanimously passed a resolution stating: "The survey team, under the escort of a police force that has become an organized gang of thugs, forcibly conducted surveys, causing many local residents to suffer minor or serious injuries. We must resolutely investigate the responsibility of the Metropolitan Police Department and the Procurement Agency." The rally also decided to send representatives to protest to the relevant parties, including the Japanese government, the Metropolitan Police Department, the Tokyo Procurement Bureau, and the American Embassy.

    Sunagawa Town Mayor Miyazaki said at the rally: "The residents of Sunagawa Town are determined to resist the government's suppression and would rather be run over by a road roller than let them take their land." Labor union representatives also stated that they would continue to wage a stern struggle.

    The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement today saying: "We strongly demand an immediate halt to the surveying and the immediate release of those arrested." The Socialist Party's statement also demanded a thorough investigation into the facts of the police's trampling on human rights and using violence to injure those defending their land, an immediate convening of a Diet committee meeting, and a resolute pursuit of the government's responsibility.

    Japanese Communist Party First Secretary Sanzo Nosaka issued a statement last night, condemning the Japanese police's brutality as the greatest disgrace in Japanese history. He said that the Japanese Communist Party demands that the Japanese government immediately halt the forced surveying, compensate the farmers for the losses suffered by their land, compensate the injured, and immediately release those arrested.

    In order to forcibly survey the land of Sunagawa Town residents to expand the US Tachikawa Air Base, the Japanese government dispatched more than 3,000 armed police officers yesterday and the day before, violently attacking those defending the land of Sunagawa Town residents. As a result, more than 1,000 people were injured, and more than ten people were arrested.

    Due to the resolute protests of Sunagawa Town residents and the Japanese public, the Japanese government temporarily halted the surveying work today. However, government officials said that the Japanese government still intends to complete the surveying work within the deadline that has already been guaranteed to the American authorities—October 16.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: News: The Japanese government was forced this afternoon to decide to completely halt the surveying work being carried out to expand the US Air Force base in Sunagawa Town, starting on October 15.

    This decision was made at a meeting held at the Prime Minister's official residence this afternoon between Defense Agency Director-General Funada, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Tanaka, National Police Agency Director-General Ishii, and Procurement Agency Director-General Imai. Defense Agency Director-General Funada issued a statement at 8:00 PM tonight saying: The surveying work for the aircraft runway, which was the main objective of the October 13 surveying, has been completed. It has been decided to end the surveying work to date, and the remaining parts will be carried out later.

    日本公众抗议警察在砂川町的暴行
    当局被迫决定全面停止测量工作
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本社会党议员、工人和学生等约四千人今天在砂川町举行群众大会，抗议日本警察为强制测量砂川町居民的土地而制造的流血事件。
    参加大会的人们一致通过了一项决议，决议指出：“测量队在已经变成有组织的暴力团的警察队的护卫下强制进行测量，使得当地居民许多人受了轻伤或重伤。我们要坚决追究警视厅和调达厅的责任”。大会并且决定派代表向日本政府、警视厅、东京调达局、美国大使馆等有关方面提出抗议。
    砂川町町长宫崎在大会上说：“砂川町居民决心反抗政府的镇压，宁愿被压路机辗死，也不让他们夺走土地。工会方面负责人也表示要继续进行严正的斗争。
    日本社会党今天发表声明说：“我们强硬要求立即停止测量，并且立即释放被捕者。”社会党在声明中还要求彻底查明警察蹂躏人权和用暴力伤害保卫土地的人们的事实，立即举行国会的委员会会议，并且要求坚决追究政府的责任。
    日本共产党第一书记野坂参三昨天晚间发表声明，指责日本警察的暴行是日本历史上最大的耻辱。他说，日本共产党要求日本政府立即停止强制测量，赔偿农民土地遭受的损失和补偿受伤者，并且立即释放被捕者。
    日本政府当局为了强制测量砂川町居民的土地来扩大美国立川空军基地，在昨天和前天出动了三千多名武装警察，凶殴保卫砂川町居民的土地的人们。结果，使一千多人受伤，十多人被捕。
    由于砂川町居民和日本公众的坚决抗议，日本政府在今天暂时停止了测量工作。但是，政府人士说，日本政府仍然要在已经向美国当局保证的限期内——10月16日完成测量工作。
    据新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本政府在今天下午被迫决定从10月15日起全面停止为扩大砂川町美国空军基地而进行的测量工作。
    这个决定是日本防卫厅长官船田、副官房长官田中、警察厅长官石井和调达厅长官今井今天下午在首相官邸举行的会议上作出的。防卫厅长官船田在今晚八时发表谈话说：作为10月13日测量的主要目的的飞机跑道的测量工作已经结束。迄今为止的测量工作决定结束，其余的部分留待以后进行。
