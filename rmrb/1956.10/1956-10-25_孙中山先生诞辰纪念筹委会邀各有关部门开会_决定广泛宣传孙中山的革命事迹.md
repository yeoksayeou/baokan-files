Xinhua News Agency, 24th: The Preparatory Committee for Commemorating the Ninetieth Anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Birth invited relevant departments to a meeting today to discuss publicity issues regarding the ninetieth anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth. The meeting requested that this expanded commemoration be used to widely conduct patriotic education and revolutionary ideological education among the younger generation.

Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for Commemorating the Ninetieth Anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Birth, spoke at the meeting about the preparations for the commemorative activities. He said that the preparatory work is actively underway. He requested that relevant departments adopt various methods to conduct a widespread publicity and education campaign on Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary deeds through this commemorative event.

Zhang Jichun, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting about the important significance of commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen. He said that Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a revolutionary leader of his generation, and his revolutionary ideas, revolutionary activities, and great personality are all things that our descendants should learn from and forever commemorate. Zhang Jichun said that Mr. Sun Yat-sen has been dead for more than thirty years, and the younger generation knows less about him. We should deepen the younger generation's understanding of Mr. Sun Yat-sen through this expanded commemoration and conduct a profound education on revolutionary thought, revolutionary tradition, and patriotism for them. Zhang Jichun emphasized that through this publicity campaign, we must explain to the younger generation that today's revolutionary victory is inseparable from the bourgeois democratic revolution led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, especially Mr. Sun Yat-sen's three major policies of alliance with Russia, cooperation with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, which are of great significance to today's revolutionary victory. Zhang Jichun hoped that all relevant parties would mobilize and treat the publicity activities about Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary deeds as an important publicity task at present.

The heads of relevant departments put forward plans and suggestions for publicity work at the meeting. In addition to writing commemorative articles and holding report meetings, lectures, and small forums, the departments also suggested inviting veterans from before and after the Xinhai Revolution to hold forums, collect historical data on Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution, compile a biography of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, translate and publish Mr. Sun Yat-sen's works and life stories for distribution abroad, and broadcast the Chinese people's commemoration of Mr. Sun Yat-sen to compatriots in Taiwan and overseas Chinese. The preparatory committee is preparing to further study the various suggestions put forward.

Representatives from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, various democratic parties, people's organizations, universities and colleges, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and relevant departments such as news, publishing, film, drama, and music attended today's meeting.

    新华社24日讯　孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念筹备委员会今天邀请各有关部门开会，讨论关于孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念的宣传问题。会议要求通过这次扩大纪念，对青年一代广泛进行爱国主义教育和革命思想教育。

    中共中央宣传部副部长张际春在会上谈了纪念孙中山先生的重要意义。他说，孙中山先生是一代的革命领袖，他的革命思想、革命活动和伟大的人格都是我们后代人应该学习和永远纪念的。张际春说，孙中山先生逝世已经三十多年，青年一代对他了解较少，我们应该通过这次扩大纪念，加深青年一代对孙中山先生的认识，向他们进行一次深刻的革命思想、革命传统和爱国主义的教育。张际春强调说，通过这一次宣传活动，我们要向青年一代说明，今天革命的胜利，是同孙中山先生领导的资产阶级民主革命分不开的，特别是孙中山先生的联俄、联共、扶助农工的三大政策，对今天革命的胜利有重大的意义。张际春希望各有关方面动员起来，把关于孙中山先生革命事迹的宣传活动当作目前一件重要的宣传工作来进行。
    各有关部门的负责人在会上提出宣传工作的计划和建议。各部门除了要撰写纪念文章，举行报告会、演讲会和小型座谈会等以外，还建议邀请辛亥革命前后的老人举行座谈会，搜集孙中山先生革命历史资料，编写孙中山先生的传记，翻译出版孙中山先生著作和生平事迹向国外发行，以及向台湾同胞和海外侨胞广播中国人民纪念孙中山先生活动的情况等。筹备委员会对提出的各项建议准备作进一步研究。
