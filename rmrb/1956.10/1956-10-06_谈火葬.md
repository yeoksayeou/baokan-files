All things move, change, are born, and die. This is the universal law, and humans are no exception. There is birth and there is death. However, since humans and animals began to differentiate, there has been a way of life and death, and it has been regarded as a major event in the world.

Here we will not talk about birth and nurturing, but only about death and burial. The methods of death and burial, ancient and modern, domestic and foreign, in various countries and ethnic groups, are nothing more than the following: First, earth burial, which is to put the body in a coffin after death and bury it in the soil. Ordinary people generally do this. As for the ancient emperors and generals, there was an outer coffin in addition to the coffin, and the coffin was divided into copper coffins and wooden coffins, the wood being the most precious. Nowadays, some important people are buried in glass coffins, and large mausoleums and cemeteries are built. After the death of the ancient emperors and generals, they also buried their precious belongings, such as pottery and jade, in the mausoleum, and even used human sacrifices, either their wives and concubines, or their slaves, ranging from hundreds to two or three. People of a slightly lower status could not use real people as sacrifices, so they used a kind of human-like "figurine." In addition, the things used by the deceased during his lifetime were also buried in the tomb. The paper offerings of vehicles, horses and people that people use after death are inherited from this. The complexity of earth burial facilities is far more than this, and I will only briefly mention a few points here. Second, wild burial, which is to throw the body of a person who has died into the wilderness and let jackals, tigers, and leopards devour it (if it is abandoned for several days and not eaten by wild animals, it is considered unlucky, and some even put meat next to the corpse as bait to lure wild animals. There is such a legend among the Mongolian people today). Wild burial is probably the oldest, and backward ethnic groups still use it today. Third, pit burial, which is to dig a large pit in advance, and after a person dies, put the body in a wooden box, transport it to the edge of the pit, pull out the bottom plate of the wooden box, and the body falls into the pit, either lying horizontally or standing upright, which is considered either auspicious or unlucky. It is said that this burial method still exists near Hohhot today. Fourth, sky burial, which is to place the body on the top of a tree after death and let birds peck at it, which is equivalent to his soul ascending to heaven. Fifth, water burial, which is to throw the body into the water after death and let it flow away with the water. Sixth, cremation, according to "Ciyuan": "Burning the body with fire after death is called cremation, which was originally a Buddhist practice. It was prevalent in China during the Song Dynasty, and is now practiced in various countries in the East and West." The Tibetan people in our country also use cremation.

Although there are various ways of death and burial, they are all inseparable from religious superstition, and all stem from people's incorrect understanding of the natural world, and their failure to clarify the relationship between man and nature. Especially due to the separation of mental labor from physical labor, the existence of heaven and hell, and the separation of the body and soul, the saying that the spirit exists after death has led people to have various superstitions, especially superstition in ghosts and gods, thinking that after a person dies, there is still a relationship of good and bad fortune with those who die later, so it is necessary to pay attention to the way of death and burial. Furthermore, due to the establishment of the state and the family system, the younger generation attaches importance to the authority and experience of parents and elders, and slavery and feudal rule promote loyalty and filial piety, especially regarding the death of the monarch and father as a major event, so they pay attention to the set of "serving him with etiquette when he is alive, and burying him with etiquette when he dies." The Chinese Confucianists advocated thick burial, and the way of death and burial reached its peak.

Among the above-mentioned various burial methods, which one is the best? I think some are remnants of primitive burial methods, which are extremely harmful to hygiene, and the arrangement of the deceased is not entirely appropriate, such as wild burial, pit burial, sky burial, and water burial. Only earth burial is the most common, and cremation is also becoming increasingly popular. Only cremation is the best burial method, and we should vigorously promote it.

However, because earth burial is not only the most common in China, but also has the longest history, earth burial is considered reasonable and justified in the minds of most people. The Confucian way of death and burial is this earth burial. Here, I would like to make a simple review of the history of earth burial in China, and also briefly explore its origins. Some books say: "In ancient burials, the corpse was thickly covered with firewood and buried in the middle of the wilderness, without a mound or trees." (See the second chapter of the Lower Transmission of the Book of Changes) This is probably wild burial, so I said that wild burial is the oldest. Some books say: "In ancient times, there were those who did not bury their parents. When their parents died, they would lift them up and throw them into a ditch." (See Mencius, Teng Wengong chapter) This is probably pit burial, which is also the oldest, because he clearly said that it was in ancient times. But what exactly are the oldest and ancient times? According to my speculation, it is probably the Paleolithic Age.

When did earth burial originate? According to the archaeological discoveries in our country over the past 30 years, especially the new archaeological discoveries in the past seven years since liberation, there have been several thousand ancient tombs alone. Everyone knows that the Yin Ruins were discovered in Anyang, Henan, a long time ago. Recently, an Yin King's mausoleum was excavated in Anyang. This is a large tomb with many people buried as sacrifices, and the adjacent tombs form rows of burial pits. More than 200 small Yin Dynasty tombs have also been excavated in Zhengzhou, Huixian, Anyang and other places. In addition to the people buried as sacrifices in the large tombs, many bronzes and a complete and exquisite stone chime were obtained. In the small tombs, many standard Yin Dynasty bronzes, jades and pottery were also obtained, and the bronzes and pottery were often in groups. Judging from this, earth burial was prevalent in the Yin Dynasty, and its origin was probably earlier than the Yin Dynasty. Recently, staff from the Xi'an Research Office of the Archaeological Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences discovered a Western Zhou site in Chang'an County, Shaanxi, and 42 tombs were discovered at the same time in the site, and they were very similar to the burial customs of the Yin Dynasty. Recently, many tombs from the Spring and Autumn Period have also been discovered. More than 50 tombs have been discovered in the eastern suburbs of Luoyang, and the three complete tombs near Changsha, Hunan Province, can be regarded as representatives of tombs from the Warring States Period. The Changsha Warring States tombs have well-preserved coffins, corpses and silk cloths wrapped around the corpses, and even the brain marrow. Tombs from the Han Dynasty are even more common in various places. More than 2,000 tombs have been excavated in the six years since liberation. Various tomb chambers built of wood, tomb bricks, and stones are no longer the graves that only bury corpses, but larger underground "underworld residences." The tomb of Zhou Chu, a general of the Jin Dynasty, was discovered in Yixing County, Jiangsu Province. The text on the tomb bricks shows that it was made in 279 AD, which was the year he died in battle. After the Jin Dynasty, the unearthed items were mainly pottery figurines and porcelain. These are all things from the tombs. The above simple materials can show that earth burial in China was already prevalent during the Yin Dynasty, probably in the Neolithic Age, and has been passed down to the present without any changes, and the funeral is extremely grand. However, although a few ancient tombs have been hidden in the deeper soil due to changes in mountains and rivers, people are born and die every year, every month, and even every day and every hour. People who die are buried in the ground, forming large tombs. One day, the world of the living will be occupied by the dead. It is said that before the Qing Dynasty, every time a dynasty was changed, the tombs were leveled once. Only the Qing Dynasty did not use this method. The people of the Qing Dynasty believed that this was the "benevolent government" of the Qing Dynasty. This shows that the impression and habit of earth burial have been deeply imprinted in the minds of the vast majority of people.

In this way, although cremation is the best burial method, it is habitually opposed by the vast majority of people. However, how many years should we level the earth burial once? Or is it better to directly use cremation? I think the method of directly using cremation is the best. At the Third Session of the First National People's Congress held in June of this year, I and many representatives submitted a proposal to the conference, suggesting advocating cremation, on the grounds that: "Because earth burial occupies a lot of land, affects farmland, and affects mechanized farming, and earth burial uses coffins, which is also a waste. Therefore, cremation should be advocated to gradually change the habit of earth burial." The Hubei Provincial Delegation also had a proposal advocating cremation, on the grounds that: "In the past, earth burial not only occupied burial land, but also wasted clothing and coffins, and was unsanitary. Moreover, sweeping the tombs during festivals is an endless burden. It is of no benefit to the deceased, but only contributes to the growth of superstition. Fortunately, after liberation, this custom has gradually changed, and the promotion of cremation... is a great benefit." The reasons for these two proposals advocating cremation are similar, but in order to take care of the habits of the vast majority of people, the methods for promoting cremation are: "First, be conscious and voluntary; second, carry out publicity and education; third, it is hoped that leaders at all levels will take the lead; fourth, attention should be paid to promoting and implementing it in cities first." The other is: "Widely publicize the harm of earth burial and the benefits of cremation, set up cremation sites, advocate storing cremated ashes in public places in urns, or scattering them in lakes and seas, and use statues, photography and other works as commemorative objects to replace earth burial." These two methods of promoting cremation are also similar. The Proposals Examination Committee of the Third Session of the First National People's Congress has submitted the above two cases to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for research. I personally, based on the method of "hoping that leaders at all levels will take the lead," also signed a list advocating cremation, and am willing to implement cremation after death.

Even so, carrying out publicity and education to the vast majority of people and breaking the ancient superstitions and habits is still very necessary today. Everyone should stand up to advocate it, either verbally or in writing, put forward their own opinions, exert all their strength, cooperate with socialist construction, correctly understand the laws of natural and social development, thoroughly clarify the relationship between man and nature, accelerate and correctly solve this major issue of life and death, and give a new evaluation to the way of life, nurturing, death and burial.

    谈火葬
    邓初民
    万物皆动皆变，皆生皆灭，这是普遍的规律，人也不能例外，有生有死，但是从人与动物开始有了区别以后，就有了生养死葬之道。而且把它看作是人间的一件大事。
    这里我们不谈生养，专谈死葬。死葬的方法，古今中外，各国家、各民族，不外如下几种：一是土葬，就是人死之后把他的尸体用棺材装起来埋在土里，一般普通人民都是如此，至于古之帝王将相，则棺以外还有椁，棺又分铜棺木棺，木则又是最珍贵之木。今之大人物死后，也有用玻璃棺材的，造了很大的陵墓和陵园。古之帝王将相死后，还要把他生前所用的珍贵物品，如陶器、玉器也随葬在陵墓里面，而且有用人殉葬的，或者是他的妻妾，或者是他的奴隶，多的几百人，少的也二三人不等。次一等的人，不能用真人来殉葬，则用一种像人的“俑”。此外，也要把死者生前所用之物随葬在墓里。现在人死之后，所用车马人物的冥器，就是从这样遗留下来的，土葬设备的复杂情况绝不止此，我在这里只略举数端而已。二是野葬，就是人死之后把他的尸体投之荒山野外，让豺狼虎豹加以吞食（如弃置数日，未被野兽吞食，反认为不祥，甚至有用肉类放在尸旁作饵以引诱野兽者，今之蒙古族有此传说）。野葬恐是最古的，今之落后民族还用之。三是坑葬，就是预先挖一个大坑，人死之后，把他的尸体装在木匣里，运之坑缘，将木匣底板一抽，尸体掉进坑内，或横卧、或竖立，则有祥不祥之分，据说今之呼和浩特附近，尚有此葬法。四是天葬，就是人死之后，把他的尸体搁置在树顶上，让飞鸟啄食，这就等于他的灵魂已经升天。五是水葬，就是人死之后，把他的尸体抛在水里，随水流去。六是火葬，据“辞源”说：“死后用火化者，谓之火葬，本为佛教之制。宋时已盛行于中国，今东西洋各国亦有之。”我国藏族也用火葬。
    死葬之道，虽有种种，但都脱不开宗教迷信关系，都由于人们对于自然界没有正确的认识，把人与自然的关系弄不清楚，特别由于脑力劳动与体力劳动的分离，出现了天堂与地狱、躯壳与灵魂分立存在，人死灵在之说，使得人们有了种种迷信，特别是迷信鬼神，以为人死之后，对于后死者，还有祸福关系，因而就必须讲究死葬之道。再则，由于国家与家庭制度的确立，青年一代重视家长与老者的权威与经验，而奴隶与封建统治，又从而提倡忠孝，对于君父之死，特别看作一件大事，于是讲究“生，事之以礼；死，葬之以礼”这一套，中国的儒家，主张厚葬，死葬之道，便达到登峰造极了。
    上述各种葬法，究竟是哪一种葬法最好呢？我以为有的是原始葬法的残余，对于卫生极有妨害，而且对死者的安置亦不尽妥，例如野葬、坑葬、天葬、水葬。只有土葬是最普遍的，火葬也在日益盛行。却只有火葬是一种最好的葬法，我们应该极力加以提倡。
    但由于土葬在中国说来不仅是最普遍的，而且在历史上也是最悠久的，因而在一般人的心目中，都把土葬看作是合情合理的，中国儒家所讲的死葬之道，就是这个土葬。这里，我想把中国土葬的历史作一简单的回顾，而且把它的起源也略加探讨。有的书上说：“古之葬者，厚衣之以薪，葬之中野，不封不树。”（见周易系辞下传第二章）这恐怕就是野葬，所以我说野葬是最古的，有的书上说：“盖上世尝有不葬其亲者，其亲死，则举而委之于壑。”（见孟子滕文公篇）这恐怕就是坑葬，这也是最古的，因为他明明说是上世。但是所谓最古和上世究竟是什么时代呢？根据我的推测，恐怕就是旧石器时代。
    土葬究竟起于何时？据我国三十年来考古的发现，特别是解放后七年多来考古的新发现，古墓一项就有好几千。河南安阳地方，大家都知道早就发现了殷墟，最近在安阳又发掘出了一座殷王的陵墓，这是一座用许多人殉葬的大墓，其邻近的陪葬形成成排的葬坑。在郑州、辉县、安阳等地，还发掘出来了二百座以上的殷代小墓。在大墓中除了殉葬的人以外，获得了许多铜器和一个完整精美的石磬，在小墓中，也获得了许多标准的殷代铜器、玉器和陶器，而铜器和陶器常常是成组的。这样看来，土葬已盛行于殷代，起源恐怕比殷代还要早一些。最近，中国科学院考古研究所西安研究室的工作人员，在陕西长安县发现了西周的遗址，在遗址中，同时发现墓葬四十二个，而且和殷代的埋葬习俗很相近。最近发现春秋时代的墓葬也不少，洛阳的东郊就发现了五十座以上，湖南省长沙附近的三个完整墓葬可作为战国时代墓葬的代表，长沙战国墓有保存很好的棺椁，尸首和包裹尸体的丝帛，甚至于脑髓。汉代的墓葬，更是普遍地出现于各地，解放后六年中所发掘的已在二千座以上。各种用木材、圹砖、石头所建成的墓室，已经不复是以前的专埋尸骨的坟墓，而是规模较大的地下“阴宅”。江苏省宜兴县发现了西晋周处的墓，周是晋代的将军，墓砖的文字说明是制作于公元279年，也就是他战死之年。晋代以后，出土的物品，以陶俑和瓷器占最主要部分。这都是墓葬里面的东西。以上简单的材料，可以说明中国的土葬在殷代大约为新石器时代已经盛行，一直流传到现在，没有什么改变，而且举行葬礼极其隆重。但是古代的坟墓，虽然有少数因山川变迁，隐没在较深的土中，但是年年月月，甚至每日每时都有人生出来和有人死去，死了的人都用土葬，筑成很大的坟墓，必然会有一天，活人的世界被死人所占去。据说在清代以前，每换一个朝代，便铲平一次坟墓，只有清代没有用这个办法，清代人民都认为这是清代的“德政”，这可见土葬的印象和习惯，已经深深刻印在广大人民的脑中。
    这样，火葬虽然是一种最好的葬法，但对广大人民说来，在习惯上是有抵触的。然而我们对于土葬，究竟是隔多少年代铲平一次好呢？还是直接地用火葬好？我认为，直接地用火葬的方法是最好的。在本年六月召开的第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上，我和许多代表向大会提出了一个提案，建议提倡火葬，理由是：“因为土葬占地很多，影响耕地，并且影响机耕，同时土葬用棺，浪费也多。故应提倡火葬，以逐渐改变土葬的习惯。”湖北省代表组也有一个提案，倡导火葬，理由是：“旧日土葬，既占用葬地，复浪费衣棺，且不卫生，而岁时祭扫，更为无穷之累。究于死者，毫无裨益，徒成助长迷信之资，幸解放后，已逐渐改变此种风习，推行火葬，……实为莫大之利。”这两个提倡火葬的提案，理由是差不多的，但由于照顾广大人民的习惯，其推行火葬的办法，一个是：“一，自觉自愿，二，进行宣传教育，三，希望各级领导人员起带头作用，四，应先注重在城市提倡实行。”一个是：“广泛宣传土葬之害与火葬之利，设立火葬场所，提倡将火化骨灰或用骨灰坛存在公共场所，或扬之于湖海，而以塑像、摄影等工作为留传的纪念物，以代替土葬。”这两个推行火葬的办法也是差不多的。第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议提案审查委员会，已将以上两案交全国人民代表大会常务委员会研究。我个人根据“希望各级领导人员起带头作用”的办法，也在一个提倡火葬签名的名单上签了名，愿意死后实行火葬。
    虽然如此，对广大人民进行宣传教育，破除古老的迷信和习惯，在今天仍是很需要的，应该大家起来提倡，或用口头，或用文字，提出自己的意见，发挥所有的力量，配合社会主义的建设，正确认识自然和社会发展的规律，彻底弄清人与自然的关系，加速地、正确地解决这一生死大问题，把生养死葬之道予以新的评价。
