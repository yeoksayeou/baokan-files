Before Reveille

Sergeant of the Army, Xu Wenyu

More than an hour before reveille, the sky was as dark as the bottom of a pot. The cold wind whistled, and even with gloves on, my fingers felt like they were being cut by knives. Deputy Squad Leader Wang Zizhong returned with the squad and, seeing that Cheng Enhe's cotton coat had fallen under the bed, picked it up to cover him. Suddenly, he realized the quilt was empty.

"Where did he go? It's not his shift on duty now." Wang Zizhong pondered, "Ah, he probably went to relieve himself. What an idiot, not even wearing his cotton coat!" Afraid that Cheng Enhe would catch a cold, he immediately took the coat and went to look for him in the toilet, muttering as he walked, "If you get sick, it will be too late to regret it!"

The toilet was quiet, and no one was there. Wang Zizhong became anxious and shouted loudly twice:
“Cheng Enhe! Cheng Enhe!" The only response was the howling cold wind before dawn.

He ran to each sentry post to ask the guards, but they all said they hadn't seen him. At this time, he hurried back to the squad with the cotton coat and woke up the squad leader.

"What, is it past reveille?" the squad leader asked groggily.

"No, do you know where Cheng Enhe went?"

"What's wrong with Cheng Enhe?" the squad leader sat up in surprise.

"It's terrible! He's not in the room, not in the toilet, I've looked everywhere, couldn't find him..." Wang Zizhong said anxiously.

"When did he get up? How come I didn't know anything?" The squad leader hurriedly put on his clothes, thinking, "Did something happen?"

Wang Zizhong looked uneasily at Cheng Enhe's bed and his half-worn cotton coat, which was pale in the lamplight. The squad leader thought: Our squad is located in the center of the whole company, surrounded by houses occupied by our own troops, with a wall outside. Only thirty-odd meters to the east is a highway. He wouldn't go to the highway to urinate! Besides, the sentries often patrol there, so there shouldn't be any accidents, right? What else could it be? Cheng Enhe asked him yesterday: "Comrade Squad Leader, do you think I can be a national defense soldier?" He replied: "Yes! But you have to build your body as strong as steel." He was so happy that even his eyebrows were smiling... Suddenly, a thought flashed through his mind: "Could it be that he can't stand the hardship and left without a word?" He immediately denied his idea, telling himself firmly: "No way." He put on his clothes and grabbed the deputy squad leader:

"Deputy Squad Leader, something unexpected may have happened, let's ask the platoon leader first!"

They woke up the platoon leader, reported the details of the matter, and their own assessment of it. The platoon leader ordered Wang Zizhong to stay in the squad and took the squad leader to report to the company headquarters.

The company headquarters was on the other side of the highway. As they crossed the highway, they heard the sound of "swishing" footsteps in the distance. At first, it wasn't very clear; later, the rhythmic "swishing" sound became louder and closer, and they could vaguely see a bald-headed person running towards them. The platoon leader looked carefully and recognized Cheng Enhe from his familiar running posture.

"Squad Leader Ten, isn't that Cheng Enhe?"

Squad Leader Ten looked into the distance and, sure enough, he was right. He couldn't help but feel annoyed and shouted sternly, "Cheng Enhe! Who told you to run outside in the middle of the night?"

Cheng Enhe knew he was in trouble and wanted to avoid it, but he had already run close to the platoon leader and squad leader, so he had to stand there panting and report: "Platoon Leader, Comrade Squad Leader, I was wrong."

The platoon leader saw that he was only wearing a thin undershirt and a pair of pants, fearing he would catch a cold, hurriedly took off his coat and put it on him, ordering: "Go back quickly, doing this is against discipline!"

"Yes!" Cheng Enhe, covered in sweat, was about to run back when he suddenly turned around and, gathering his courage, said to the platoon leader: "Comrade Platoon Leader, please continue to let me train, my body has indeed become stronger after training like this for a month. How can I defend the motherland if my body isn't as strong as steel!"

The platoon leader looked at his earnest expression and naive appearance and couldn't help but like him from the bottom of his heart. In fact, he loved this new soldier more than ever, but he still said seriously: "Requests that violate military discipline and regulations cannot be granted. Training is not about reckless exertion. Because you are a new comrade, you are forgiven this time. As long as you follow the regular drills, your body will become even stronger than steel. Okay, about face! Go back!"

Cheng Enhe, following the order, turned around like a whirlwind and ran towards the dormitory to put on his clothes. But the squad leader stood ashamed behind the platoon leader without moving. The platoon leader turned to him and said: "Comrade Squad Leader, what kind of unexpected thing is this? Comrade, you need to examine yourself carefully. How can you lead them to complete border defense tasks if you don't understand the thoughts and actions of the soldiers in your squad?"

The morning wind carried the sound of the bugle, and the troops assembled on the parade ground. The platoon leader looked at the squad leader standing there and ordered: "Go to roll call first, and report your self-criticism to me tomorrow!"

"Yes!" The squad leader saluted shamefully and ran along the highway.

    起床以前
    陆军中士　徐文玉
    离起床还有一个多小时，天黑得像锅底一样。寒风飕飕地刮着，带着手套，手指头还冻得像刀割一样。副班长王子中带班回来，见程恩和的棉衣掉在床下面，便拾起来给他去盖。忽然发现被窝里空空的。
      “人上哪里去了？现在又不是他上哨。”王子中沉思着，“啊，他可能去解手了。真傻瓜，棉衣也不穿！”他怕程恩和着凉，立即提着棉衣往厕所找来，边走嘴里边叨咕着：“冻病了，后悔就来不及啦！”
    厕所里静静的，没有人。王子中着急起来了，用力地喊了两声：
  “程恩和！程恩和！”回答他的是黎明前呼啸的寒风。
    他跑到各个岗哨去问哨兵，都说没见到。这时，他抱着棉衣匆匆忙忙地回到班里，叫醒班长。
      “怎么，起床的时间过了？”班长朦朦胧胧地问。
      “没有，你知道程恩和上哪里去了？”
      “程恩和怎么啦？”班长惊讶地坐了起来。
      “真糟糕！他屋里没有，厕所里也没有，我到处找，没找到…………”王子中焦急地说。
      “他什么时候起来的？我怎么一点也不知道？”班长忙穿上衣服，心想：“是出了什么意外？”
    王子中不安地看着程恩和的床，和他那件被灯光照得发白的半旧棉衣。班长想着：我们这班是住在全连的中心，四周都是自己部队住的房子，房外是围墙，只有东面离这里三十多公尺的地方，是一条公路，要是小便总不会到公路上去呀！再说，岗哨也常到那里游动，总不会有什么意外吧？除此之外，又有什么可能呢？程恩和昨天还问他：“班长同志，你看我当个国防军战士行不？”他回答：“行！不过要把身体锻炼得像钢铁一样结实。”他喜欢得连眉毛都发笑，………。忽然，一个念头闪过：“难道是他吃不来苦，闷声不响地走了？”他马上又否定了自己的想法，自己对自己坚信地说：“不会的。”他穿好衣服，一把拉住副班长：
      “副班长，可能发生了什么意外，咱们先请示排长吧！”
    他们唤醒了排长，报告了事情的经过和自己对这件事情的估计。排长命令王子中留在班里，自己带着班长往连部报告去了。
    连部是在公路的那边，当他们穿过公路时，只听远处的公路上有“沙沙”的跑步声。开始，还听不十分清楚；后来，这“沙沙”的有节奏的声音越响越近了，隐隐约约可以看出，一个光头的人向他们跑来，排长仔细看了看，从那熟悉的跑步姿态上，他认出那就是程恩和。
      “十班长，那不是程恩和吗？”
      十班长望远处一看，果然不错，不由得心里恼火起来，严厉地大声叫：“程恩和！谁叫你半夜在外面跑步？”
    程恩和知道坏事了，想躲开，可是已经跑近排长和班长了，只好喘吁吁地立正站在那里报告：“排长，班长同志，我错了。”
    排长见他只穿一件卫生衣和一条单裤，怕他着凉，忙把大衣脱下，给他披上，命令说：“快回去，这样做是违反纪律的！”
      “是！”程恩和带着一头热气正要往回跑，突然又转回身来，鼓足勇气对排长说：“排长同志，请继续让我锻炼下去吧，我这样锻炼了一个月，身体确实强起来了，身体不锻炼得像钢铁一样结实，怎能保卫祖国呀！”
    排长看他认真请求的神气和那稚气的样子，由不得从心里喜欢。实在的，他比任何时候更爱这个新战士了，但他仍严肃地说：“违反部队纪律、制度的请求是不能得到允许的。锻炼不是拚命。因为你是新同志，这次原谅你。只要按照正课操练，你的身体就会练得比钢铁还结实。好，向后转！回去！”
    程恩和按着命令，一阵旋风似地转了过去，跑向宿舍穿衣服去了。可是班长却惭愧地站在排长身后一动也不动。排长转过脸来对他说：“班长同志，这是什么意外的事呀？同志，你要好好检查检查自己，本班战士的思想行动都摸不清，怎能领导他们完成边防任务？”
    晨风送来了军号的声音，部队向操场集合。排长看着站在那里的班长，命令道：“先去出操，明天把你的检查情况来报告我！”
      “是！”班长羞愧地敬了礼，沿着公路跑去。
