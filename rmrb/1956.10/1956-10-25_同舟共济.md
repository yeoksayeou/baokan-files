From the local newspaper:

    "Sharing a Boat"
    The Fuyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bin County, Heilongjiang Province, has a total of four production teams, three of which had all their crops flooded, with only the Tianxingtun production team experiencing little flooding. The members of this team wrote to the Heilongjiang Daily editorial department asking: "Is it okay for each production team to independently distribute the autumn harvest without unified distribution?" "If the cooperative conducts a unified autumn harvest distribution, our production team will have to cover the losses of the other three production teams, letting them exploit most of our labor results. Isn't this a violation of the socialist principle of distribution according to work?"
    The Heilongjiang Daily published an editorial on October 5th entitled "The Need to Promote the Spirit of Sharing a Boat" to answer this question. The editorial said: The suggestion made by some members of the Tianxingtun production team that the affected teams should conduct the autumn harvest distribution independently may seem beneficial in the short term because their production team suffered less damage, and they would get more through independent distribution, while unified distribution for the whole cooperative would result in less. However, if we broaden our horizons and look at the bigger picture, we will find that only caring about the small interests of one's own production team will inevitably affect and harm the overall interests of the other production teams in the cooperative, as well as the long-term interests of the entire cooperative (including the Tianxingtun production team) in next year's production and future development. Originally, if the entire cooperative suffers a disaster, as long as everyone unites and relies on the collective economic organization of the cooperative to carry out production self-rescue, they will definitely be able to overcome the disaster, make up for the losses suffered in the flood, and everyone will not reduce their income as a result.
    Our people have always had the social virtue of "helping neighbors in disaster relief." People in non-disaster areas have always been enthusiastic in helping people in disaster areas solve production and life difficulties, and supporting them to rebuild their homes and restore production as soon as possible. From the perspective of an agricultural production cooperative, due to the overall interests and connections of collective labor and common prosperity, it is even more necessary to have this spirit of sharing a boat, sharing weal and woe, and uniting to overcome natural disasters. If the crops of the Tianxingtun production team suffered serious disasters, and the crops of the other three production teams suffered less or no disasters, and they also proposed that each production team should distribute independently, then what would the members of the Tianxingtun production team think about this matter? This principle is very obvious.
    The editorial pointed out that the idea of the Tianxingtun production team members that unified distribution is exploitation by other teams, covering their losses, or violating the socialist principle of distribution according to work is wrong. From the day the advanced agricultural production cooperative was established, the private land, draught animals, large agricultural tools, and other major means of production of all members were transferred to the collective ownership of the cooperative, and no longer belonged to any original elementary cooperative or village. The current production team is only an organizational form for the cooperative to carry out production activities, responsible for completing the production tasks assigned by the cooperative management committee. Each production team has a fixed area of land and a certain number of draught animals and agricultural tools in order to facilitate the full发挥 of the production team's independent production role, rather than belonging to any one team. Regardless of whether the crops cultivated by any team are a bumper harvest or suffer a disaster, each production team in the entire cooperative has a share. Of course, the autumn harvest distribution should also be distributed together. This is completely reasonable. It is neither exploitation nor covering anyone's losses. The reduced harvest or no harvest of the disaster-stricken production teams is not caused by their laziness or failure to take good care of the crops. They have worked as hard as the non-disaster-stricken or lightly disaster-stricken production teams, but only because the natural conditions in their cultivated areas are not good, they have been attacked by floods or waterlogging. The members of the disaster-stricken production teams participate in the autumn harvest distribution of the entire cooperative with the number of workdays they have earned during their usual work, which is naturally a reasonable reward for their labor and does not violate the socialist principle of distribution according to work.

### “同舟共济”

    “同舟共济”
    黑龙江省宾县富源农业生产合作社共有四个生产队，其中三个队的庄稼全部被淹，只有天兴屯生产队淹的很少。这个队的社员写信问黑龙江日报编辑部：“不统一进行秋收分配，由各生产队单独分行不行？”“如果合作社统一进行秋收分配，我们生产队就要给另三个生产队背窟窿了，让他们剥削去大部分劳动成果，不是违反了社会主义按劳取酬的原则了吗？”
    黑龙江日报在10月5日以“需要发扬同舟共济的精神”为题发表社论，回答了这个问题。社论说：天兴屯生产队有些社员提出的受灾社由各生产队单独进行秋收分配的主张，从眼前看可能因本生产队受灾轻，单独分配自己会多得些，全社统一分配要少得些。但是，如果放宽眼光，站在高处往远看一看，就会发觉只顾本生产队的一点小利益，必然要影响和损害全社其他生产队的整体利益，以及全社（包括天兴屯生产队在内）明年生产和将来发展生产的长远利益。本来，全社受了灾，只要大家团结一致，依靠合作社集体经济组织力量进行生产自救，就一定能够战胜灾害，弥补水灾中所遭受的损失，大家都不会因此而减少收入。
    我国人民素有“救灾爱邻”的社会美德，非灾区群众向来都是满腔热忱地帮助受灾区群众解决生产和生活上的困难，支援他们尽快地重建家园，恢复生产。从一个农业生产合作社来说，由于集体劳动和共同富裕的整体利益和联系，更需要有这种同舟共济患难与共的精神，团结一致战胜自然灾害。假如天兴屯生产队的庄稼遭到严重灾害，而另外三个生产队的庄稼受灾较少或不受灾，他们也提出由各生产队单独分配，那么，天兴屯的生产队的社员又该怎么想这件事呢？这个道理是很明显的。
    社论指出天兴屯生产队社员认为统一分配是被别的队剥削、是背窟窿，或违反了社会主义按劳取酬的原则，这种想法是不对的。从建立高级农业生产合作社那天起，全体社员私有的土地、耕畜、大型农具等主要生产资料，都转为合作社集体所有了，就不再属于哪个原初级社和哪个屯的了。现在的生产队只是合作社进行生产活动的一种组织形式，负责完成社管理委员会分配给的生产任务。每个生产队所以有固定的联片土地和一定数量耕畜、农具，是为了便于充分地发挥生产队独立进行生产的作用，而不是属于哪个队所有。不管哪个队负责耕作的庄稼丰收或受灾，全社每个生产队都有一份，当然秋收分配也应该在一起分配了，这是完全合情合理的。既不是什么剥削，也不是替谁背窟窿。受灾生产队的庄稼减收或颗粒不收，并不是因为他们懒惰或不劳动而没有侍弄好造成的。他们与未受灾或受灾轻的生产队同样劳动了，只不过是因为他们负责的耕作区自然条件不好，受了洪水的袭击，或者内涝了。受灾生产队的社员，以他们平时劳动所挣的劳动日的数量参加全社的秋收分配，自然是以他们的劳动取得的合理报酬，并没有违反社会主义按劳取酬的原则。
