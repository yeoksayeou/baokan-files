Honors Outside the Workshop
    Jiang Zhe

    It was already past twelve o'clock at night. The wind hadn't stopped, and it was the freezing month of December. On the loess road in the outskirts of Beijing, two people were walking hurriedly.
    The man looked about twenty-four or five years old; the woman was younger than him, with a red scarf tightly wrapped around her head. In the dim night, it was difficult to see their faces clearly.
    At this moment, they almost forgot that they still had to walk more than twenty li in the cold wind, recalling the scene of performing "Two Mindsets" under the bright gas lamps in front of thousands of farmers just now, their hearts couldn't help but surge with excitement; the voices of the farmers thanking them repeatedly as they saw them off for a long distance seemed to still echo in their ears.
    In the winter of 1955, the sound of firecrackers resounded throughout Beijing. During the upsurge of farmers in the suburbs of Beijing joining advanced cooperatives, the amateur drama troupe of the Beijing Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory accepted the invitation of the farmers of Laiguangying in the eastern suburbs to perform "Two Mindsets." The actors who performed this play were Zhang Qin, a worker from the singeing workshop, and Duan Huizhen, a weft-detecting worker from the weaving factory. They had already performed this play more than twenty times. It just so happened that no one else could help that day, so in the end, only the two of them took some simple stage sets and set off.
    Zhang Qin and Duan Huizhen had been members of the amateur drama troupe for several years. In the dozen or so scripts performed by the troupe, neither of them had ever played elderly farmers. Moreover, it so happened that Duan Huizhen was on night shift during rehearsals, so the two of them could only squeeze in a little time to go over the lines. When they rehearsed on the stage on Sundays, the director said that their acting was not like it should be, and they shouldn't just look at the script and shout. Therefore, during breaks, Zhang Qin always lingered with the old workers in the workshop. In quiet corners and by a small river behind the dormitory, he could often be seen reciting lines and performing.
    The careful nineteen-year-old girl, Duan Huizhen, also began her artistic creation. Every day when she returned to the dormitory, she deliberately took a small path, because several farming families lived there. There, she paid attention to the every move of the middle-aged farm women. She saw how skillfully they worked, how straightforwardly they spoke, and how shrewishly they scolded their children... She remembered all of this deeply in her heart, and even secretly imitated her elderly mother's way of walking and holding a basin after returning home.
    The hard work was not in vain. After the official performance of this play, in addition to winning the praise of the entire factory, it also won an award at the Beijing Municipal Workers' Amateur Art Festival at the beginning of this year.
    Zhang Qin and Duan Huizhen are just two of the forty-odd male and female worker actors in the troupe.
    Zhang Qin first showed his talent for performing at a party not long after entering the factory. At that party, he grabbed a lot of on-site materials and wrote and told a crosstalk segment himself, which won applause from the entire audience. People inquired about this stranger from each other, and the head of the amateur drama troupe also took the initiative to find him, and soon let him participate in the performance of "The People Are Advancing."
    He was originally a person who didn't like to talk much. The seven or eight years of apprenticeship he spent in a barber shop in his youth had long tormented him into not speaking much. It was only after entering the factory after liberation that he regained his youth and felt fresh about everything. He couldn't help but stretch his muscles and bones and sing loudly. Since acting, he has become more cheerful.
    Zhang Qin also clearly remembers that when he was performing "A Century-Long Plan," he felt that the quality accidents in his workshop should also be resolved. He researched that the poor quality of cloth dyeing was due to the rollers of the singeing machine not being red enough, so he calculated the coal burning time and mastered the coal burning technology. Sure enough, after the roller problem was solved, no more quality accidents occurred. He has been selected as an advanced producer of the factory many times, and at the end of last year, he also attended the city's factory youth production activist conference.
    He gains a lot from every play he performs. He often thinks of many things, so he automatically writes a summary of his experiences each time, telling the Party what is in his heart. His awareness has been continuously improved, and last year, he joined the ranks of the Party from the ranks of the Youth League.
    Duan Huizhen is also an advanced producer, and at the same time, she is full of vitality like other young girls. In addition to acting, she also participates in the factory's women's basketball team and women's motorcycle team, and also serves as a branch committee member in the Youth League. She does all of this very well.
    Not long ago, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture brought good news to the entire factory: the amateur drama troupe of the State Bank Administration of the Soviet Union, which has a history of more than ten years, will establish regular contact with their factory. When the photos and letters sent from the Soviet Union were posted on the bulletin board, the factory boiled. Zhang Qin, who is already the vice-chairman of the amateur drama troupe, is busy discussing with everyone about writing a reply; Duan Huizhen, facing these photos, has infinite fantasies in her mind...

    车间外的荣誉　　
    江者
    已经是夜里十二点多钟了。风还没有停，正是十二月天寒地冻的时候，在京郊的黄土大道上，有两个人正匆匆地走着。
    男的约模二十四五岁；女的比他年轻，她头上紧紧地围了一条红色的头巾。夜色模糊中，很难看清他们的脸。
    此刻，他们几乎忘记了还要在寒风中走二十多里的路，回想着刚才在光亮的汽灯下，在上千的农民面前演“两个心眼”的情景，心中不禁激荡着一股兴奋的感情；耳边仿佛还回绕着农民们把自己送出了老远一再道谢的声音。
    1955年的冬天，鞭炮声响彻了北京城。正在京郊农民转入高级社的高潮里，北京机织印染厂业余话剧团接受了东郊来广营农民的邀请去演“两个心眼”。演这个戏的是烧毛车间工人张勤和织厂的落纬工段惠贞。这个戏，他们已经演过二十几场了。刚巧这一天别人都不能帮忙，最后只好由他们俩带了点简单的景片就出发了。
    张勤和段惠贞参加业余剧团已经几年了，在剧团演出的十几个剧本里，谁也没演过老年的农民，又搭上排戏时正好段惠贞值夜班，两个人只能抽一点空子对对词，等到星期日在排演场上排演时，导演就说他们演的不像，不该只看着剧本空喊。于是，张勤在休息时总是和车间的老工人在一起流连，在僻静的角落和宿舍后面的一条小河边，常常可以看到他在背台词、表演。
    十九岁的细心的姑娘——段惠贞也开始了她的艺术创造。每天回宿舍时，她特意绕着走一条小道，因为那里居住着几户农家。在那里她注意着中年农妇们的一举一动，她看见她们劳动时是那样的麻利，说话时是那样爽朗，骂孩子时又是那样泼辣……这一切她都深深地记在心里，甚至回家后也偷偷地模仿着年老的妈妈走路、端盆的样子。
    苦心没有白费，正式演出这个戏后，除了博得全厂的好评，还在今年年初北京市职工业余文艺会演时得了奖。
    张勤和段惠贞只不过是剧团里四十多个男女工人演员中的两个。
    张勤在入厂后不久的一次晚会上，第一次闪露出表演的才能。在那次会上他抓了许多现场材料自编自说了一段相声，博得了全场的掌声，人们互相打听着这个陌生人，业余话剧团的团长也主动去找他，不久就让他参加“人民在前进”的演出。
    他原来是个连话也不爱多说的人，少年时代在一个理发馆里度过的七、八年的学徒生活，早已把他折磨得不大说话了。只是解放后进了工厂，他才恢复了自己的青春，对一切都感到新鲜，他情不自禁地要舒展自己的筋骨，要破喉高歌。演戏以来，他就变得更开朗了。
      张勤还清楚地记得，在演“百年大计”时，他觉得自己车间的质量事故也应该解决，他研究出染布质量差是因烧毛机的滚筒烧的不红，于是他就计算烧煤时间和掌握烧煤的技术。果然，滚筒问题解决后，一直没再发生过质量事故。他多次被选为本厂的先进生产者，去年年底还出席了全市的工厂青年生产积极分子大会。
    他每演一个戏，都有不少收获。他常会联想起许多事来，因此每次都自动写一份心得，向党诉说着心里的话。他的觉悟不断地提高，去年，他就由青年团的队伍里参加到党的行列里去了。
    段惠贞也是一个先进生产者，同时她也像其他年青的姑娘一样充满了活力。除了演戏，她还参加了厂里的女子篮球队、女子摩托车队，在青年团里还担任着支部委员，这一切她都做的很好。
    不久以前，北京市文化局给全厂带来一个喜讯，有着十几年历史的苏联国家银行管理局的业余剧团要和他们厂建立经常联系。当从苏联寄来的照片、信件在布告栏里张贴出来的时候，厂里沸腾了。已经是业余话剧团副团长的张勤就忙着和大家商量写回信；段惠贞面对着这些照片，脑子里涌起了无限的幻想……。（附图片）
