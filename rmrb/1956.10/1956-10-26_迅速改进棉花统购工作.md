    Rapidly Improve Cotton Unified Purchase Work
    This year, due to severe disasters in several key cotton-producing areas, the national cotton production plan will not be fulfilled. However, provinces that have not suffered disasters, especially key producing areas that have not been affected, are experiencing bumper harvests this year. Therefore, it is expected that the national cotton output this year will still increase compared to last year's actual output. Among them, key producing areas such as Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang will see a decrease in production compared to last year, while key producing areas such as Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, Hubei, Xinjiang, Henan, Liaoning, and Jiangxi will see an increase. After offsetting the increases and decreases, it is estimated that cotton production this year may increase by one million to several hundred thousand dan compared to last year.
    Since the new cotton came on the market, the procurement work in various places has achieved certain results. For example, in Mianyang County, Hubei Province, cotton procurement in September exceeded the monthly plan by 33%; it is also expected that the procurement quantity in Shanxi Province in September will also exceed the monthly plan. Some other regions also have similar situations. However, judging from the overall national situation, the progress of cotton procurement is quite slow. According to statistics, by the end of September, the amount of cotton purchased nationwide only accounted for 53.67% of the same period last year.
    The reasons for the poor procurement situation, from the perspective of production units, are mainly: First, the cotton harvest season this year is more than 20 days later than last year; Second, in order to increase sideline production and increase the income of the agricultural cooperatives, many places are preparing to keep the picked seed cotton for self-processing and sale of lint cotton during the slack farming season; Third, now is the busy farming season, and some agricultural cooperatives have not organized the labor force to sell or process cotton very well. Some agricultural cooperatives are even afraid that the purchasing departments will deduct the advance purchase payments, and are unwilling to sell cotton, or distribute the cotton to the members. From the perspective of purchasing units, the main reason is that some purchasing staff believe that after agricultural cooperativization, agricultural cooperatives will send cotton to the purchasing stations in batches, thus relaxing the organization of cotton procurement work and excessively canceling cotton purchasing points (some counties only have one or two purchasing stations left), so that the cotton that farmers bring out in some places has no one to purchase. This is an important lesson.
    The overall situation of cotton production this year has been determined, and improving cotton procurement work is now an urgent matter. Party organizations at all levels must not relax leadership over this work.
    Procurement staff should implement the "zoning and fixed-point" procurement method in a positive sense. The staff of the procurement stations should go deep into the agricultural cooperatives, provide technical guidance to farmers, and mobilize farmers to sell cotton in a timely manner. Adopting the zoning and fixed-point procurement method does not mean that we can sit and wait for cotton to be delivered. Each procurement station must fully understand how many agricultural cooperatives are in its area of responsibility, how large the cotton output is, how much cotton should be left to farmers, and how much cotton should be sold. Basic-level Party and government organizations should mobilize agricultural cooperatives to sell cotton to the state in accordance with the state-approved tasks, and ensure that all commodity cotton that should be purchased under the unified purchase system is purchased in a timely manner. Unless there are special circumstances, the deadline for delivery and purchase should generally not be postponed. Conscientiously doing a good job in allocating labor within the cooperatives is an important key to ensuring timely picking, timely processing, and timely delivery of cotton, and specific assistance should be given to each agricultural cooperative in doing a good job in labor allocation. Where too many purchasing stations have been withdrawn and cannot meet the requirements of new cotton procurement, purchasing stations or temporary purchasing points should be added as early as possible in accordance with the principles of facilitating cotton sales for farmers and conforming to the direction of circulation.
    When purchasing cotton, the work of clearing up cotton pre-purchase contracts should also be done at the same time. While inspecting the grade and pricing, the pre-purchase contracts should be checked, and the results of the check should be told to the agricultural cooperative cadres and farmers, so that they know the implementation of the pre-purchase contracts. Farmers should be educated to earnestly implement pre-purchase contracts. If the situation changes and the contract cannot be fulfilled, it can be appropriately changed after review, but it should also be explained to the agricultural cooperative cadres and farmers so that they establish the concept of correctly implementing pre-purchase contracts. The pre-purchase deposits that agricultural cooperatives and farmers have received from the state should be cleared in installments as much as possible during this cotton purchase. It should be explained to the cadres and farmers that if the pre-purchase deposit is not cleared to the state as much as possible now, it will affect the state's future pre-purchase; moreover, if it is not cleared this year, it will be necessary to receive the pre-purchase deposit from the state again next year, which will form two years of pre-purchase deposit to be returned in one year, and the impact on the income distribution of the agricultural cooperative will be even greater. If the pre-purchase deposit is returned, and the cooperative still has economic difficulties, it can apply for a loan from the state. Of course, agricultural cooperatives in severely affected areas should be given appropriate consideration; if the pre-purchase deposit cannot be returned, it can be approved to be postponed or loaned by the bank after certain procedures. In short, the seriousness of the pre-purchase contract must be maintained.
    The tendency to downgrade and depress prices must be corrected, and the tendency to upgrade and raise prices should also be prevented. The grading method of "grading cotton against the sample" should be implemented, and cotton grades should be correctly assessed with a serious and responsible attitude. To this end, the purchasing staff must be fully educated and mobilized, and the mass line must be implemented. Since 1955, the staff of the Huaimiao Purchasing Station in Yanshi County, Henan Province, have examined the past capitalistic business ideas, examined the reasons for inaccurate grading, and discussed what are the correct policy viewpoints and mass viewpoints. As a result, they treated the inspection and grading of cotton with a responsible attitude in their work, and mobilized experienced farmers to carry out grading work together, so that the inspection technology and inspection accuracy continued to improve. Since the new cotton came on the market this year, the accuracy rate of their inspection grades has reached 99.91%, and the accuracy rate of the grade length of the purchased lint cotton has reached 97%, thereby correctly implementing the policy of superior quality and superior price, and the masses are very satisfied. Purchasing staff should pass on grading techniques to farmers, so that they can effectively dry, pick clean, separate good from bad, and store in grades. Agricultural cooperatives should formulate work quotas and labor remuneration standards for picking cotton according to the principle of taking both quality into account. Doing so will not only improve the quality of cotton, but also allow the cotton in the cooperative to be sold at a good price, which is beneficial to the country, the agricultural cooperative, and the members. Boyan Agricultural Cooperative in Wu'an County, Hebei Province, implemented the separation of good flowers and inferior flowers for picking and storage, and achieved drying and cleaning, raising 200,000 jin of grade 5 cotton to the standard of grade 4, and sold it for 1,700 yuan more. This is a good example.
    Agricultural cooperatives with cotton ginning capabilities can be allowed to process on their own. It should be noted that the time for cotton to remain in the cooperative for processing should not be too long, and it should not affect the country's timely purchase and transfer of cotton to the textile industry department; more attention should be paid to ensuring that the quality of cotton is not reduced as a result. For example, after the Renmin Agricultural Cooperative in Tangyin County, Henan Province, processed cotton on its own, the original grade 6 cotton became grade 8 cotton, resulting in reduced income despite the labor involved. Obviously, this is detrimental to both the country and the agricultural cooperative.
    The cotton maturity season has been delayed this year, and early frost has fallen in some areas. Measures should be taken to strengthen the later-stage management of cotton fields, strive to harvest more mature white cotton, and reduce frost-yellow cotton.
    Currently, it is the season for large-scale cotton marketing and harvesting. Party committees and purchasing departments at all levels should conduct an inspection of cotton unified purchase work in order to improve cotton unified purchase work and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the state's cotton unified purchase task for the 1956-1957 fiscal year.

### 迅速改进棉花统购工作

    迅速改进棉花统购工作
    今年全国的棉花生产，由于几个重点产区受了严重的灾害，不能完成计划。但是，没有受灾的省份，特别是没有遭灾的重点产区，今年都是丰收的年景。因此，预计今年全国棉花的产量仍比去年实产量有所增加。其中比去年减产的有河北、江苏、安徽、浙江等重点产区，比去年增产的有山西、陕西、山东、湖北、新疆、河南、辽宁、江西等重点产区。增减相抵，估计今年棉花产量可能比去年增加一百几十万担。
    新棉上市以来，各地的采购工作已经有了一定的成绩。如湖北沔阳县9月份棉花收购超过月计划的33％；山西省9月份收购数量预计也要超过月计划。其他一些地区也有这样的情况。但是，从全国总的情况看，棉花收购的进度是相当迟缓的。据统计，到9月底为止，全国收购的棉花数量只占去年同期的53.67％。
    收购情况不好的原因，从生产单位方面来看，主要是：第一、今年棉花收获季节比去年迟二十多天；第二、不少地方的农业社为了增加副业生产，增加社的收入，准备把采摘下来的籽棉留到农闲的时候自行加工，出售皮棉；第三、现在正是农忙季节，有些农业社没有很好地组织劳动力出售或者加工棉花，有些农业社甚至怕采购部门扣还预购款，不愿意出售棉花，或者把棉花分给社员。从收购单位方面来看，主要原因是某些采购工作人员认为农业合作化以后，农业社出售棉花的时候将会成批送到采购站，因而放松了棉花收购的组织工作，过多地撤销了棉花收购点（有的县只留一、两个采购站），以致有些地方农民拿出来的棉花无人收购。这是一个重要的教训。
    今年棉花生产大局已定，改进棉花收购工作已经刻不容缓了。各级党组织决不可对这个工作放松领导。
    采购工作人员要在积极的意义上实行“划片定点”的采购方法。采购站的工作人员应该深入农业社，对农民进行技术指导，动员农民及时出售棉花。采取划片定点的采购方法，决不是说可以坐等棉花送上门来。每一个采购站都要充分了解自己负责收购的区域内有多少农业社，棉花的产量有多大，应该留给农民多少棉花，应该出售多少棉花。基层党政组织应该动员农业社按照国家核定的任务，向国家交售棉花，保证把应该统购的全部商品棉及时地收购起来。只要没有特殊情况，一般不应推迟交售和收购的期限。认真做好社内劳动力的调配，是保证棉花及时采摘、及时加工、及时交售的重要关键，应该具体帮助各个农业社把劳动力调配工作做好。采购站撤得过多，不能适应新棉收购要求的地方，应该根据便利农民出售棉花和合乎流转方向的原则，及早增设采购站或临时收购点。
    在收购棉花的时候，要同时做好棉花预购合同的清理工作。在验级和作价的同时，要查对预购合同，把查对的结果告诉农业社干部和农民，让他们知道执行预购合同的情况。应该教育农民切实执行预购合同。如果情况发生变化，不能履行合同，经过审查可以适当改变，但也要向农业社干部和农民讲清楚，使他们树立起正确执行预购合同的观念。对于农业社和农民曾经向国家领取的预购定金，应尽可能地在这次棉花收购中分次扣还清楚。要向干部和农民说明白：如果现在不尽可能地将预购定金扣还给国家，就会影响到国家今后的预购；而且如果今年不扣还清楚，下一年度又要向国家领取预购定金，那就会形成两年预购定金一年归还，对农业社收入分配的影响就会更大。如果归还了预购定金，社内还有经济上的困难，可以向国家请求贷款。当然，对受灾严重地区的农业社，应当给予适当照顾；如果预购定金确实不能归还，可以经过一定手续批准缓期或者由银行贷款。总之，要保持预购合同的严肃性。
    压级压价的偏向必须纠正，提级提价的偏向也应当防止。要贯彻执行“对样评棉”的分级方法，以严肃负责的态度正确评定棉花等级。为此，必须对收购人员进行充分的教育和动员，并贯彻执行群众路线。1955年以来，河南省偃师县槐庙采购站的工作人员，检查了过去有资本主义经营思想，检查了验级不准确的原因，讨论了什么是正确的政策观点和群众观点，因而在工作中以负责的态度对待了棉花的检验和评级工作，并且动员有经验的农民一起进行验级工作，使检验技术和检验正确程度不断提高。今年新棉上市以来，他们检验等级的正确率已达到99.91％，收购皮棉的品级长度准确率达到97％，从而正确地执行了优级优价的政策，群众十分满意。采购工作人员应当把分级技术传授给农民，使他们切实做到晒干、拣净、好坏分开、分级保存。农业社应当根据质量兼顾的原则，制订摘棉花的工作定额和劳动报酬标准。这样做，既能提高棉花质量，又能使社里的棉花卖到好价钱，对国家对农业社对社员都是有利的。河北省武安县伯延农业社实行了好花次花分摘分存，作到了晒干拣净，把二十万斤五级的棉花提高到四级的标准，多卖了一千七百元。这是很好的例子。
    对于有轧棉花能力的农业社，可以允许他们自行加工。应当注意的是，棉花留在社内加工的时间不应过长，不可因此而影响国家及时地收购和调运棉花给纺织工业部门；更要注意，不可因此而降低棉花的质量。如河南省汤阴县人民农业社把棉花自行加工以后，原来的六级棉花变成了八级棉花，结果是化了劳动还减少了收入。显然，这对国家和对农业社都是不利的。
    今年棉花成熟季节推迟，部分地区已经降了早霜。应该采取措施，加强棉田的后期管理，力求多收成熟的白棉，减少霜黄棉。
    目前正是棉花大量上市和大量采摘的季节。各地党委和采购部门应当对棉花统购工作进行一次检查，以便改进棉花统购工作，保证完成和超额完成1956—1957年度国家对棉花的统购任务。
