    Ominous Signs

    The British Empire, which has been flexing its military muscle at the Egyptian people over the Suez Canal issue, has recently encountered many troubling events:

    On September 10th, the new building of the joint headquarters of the British Middle East Ground Forces and Air Force, located in southern Cyprus, suddenly caught fire and was almost completely destroyed.

    On September 20th, a British destroyer, the "Decoy," which had sailed to the Mediterranean to threaten Egypt, experienced a violent explosion off the coast of Malta.

    Shortly thereafter, twenty-one British reservists, sent to Cyprus, firmly demanded to return home, unwilling to participate in the war, forcing British military authorities to arrest them.

    Recently, on October 5th, approximately two hundred members of the Grenadier Guards stationed on Malta held a large demonstration against military service. It is said that similar incidents have also occurred in Britain, with growing discontent among the ten thousand British reservists called up to threaten war against Egypt.

    Reading these reports, one cannot help but recall an ancient Chinese story: It is said that in the past, there was a general who loved to wage war. He mounted his warhorse and set out on a campaign. On the way, the warhorse suddenly whined, and its hoof was twisted. The general quickly reined in his horse and sighed, "This is an ominous sign," and abandoned his plans for war. This general was considered wise because the warhorse's leg broke before even going into battle; surely, defeat would be inevitable if the war started.

    Britain's military buildup in the Mediterranean to threaten Egypt is also only halfway to war. Before even truly engaging in battle, its "warhorse" has developed problems, certainly not a good omen. If the British government had any wisdom, it would have already reined in its horse, sighed, and abandoned its plans for military force.

    However, it seems that the British government lacks this self-awareness. According to a United Press report from London on the 9th, just hours after receiving reports of recent unrest among its troops in the Mediterranean, the British government issued a formal statement. In the statement, the British government, while expressing serious unease and "regret" over the growing anti-war sentiment among reservists, still demanded that the called-up reservists "continue to serve."

    The "warhorses" are unwilling to go to war, but the British government is forcing them to do so, which will absolutely not lead to good results!

### 不祥之兆

    不祥之兆
    在苏伊士运河问题上向埃及人民耀武扬威的大英帝国，最近碰到了许多大伤脑筋的事：
    9月10日，设在塞浦路斯南部的英国驻中东地面部队及空军部队联合总部新厦，突然失火，几乎全部被烧毁。
    9月20日，开到地中海去威胁埃及的一艘英国驱击舰“迪科伊号”，在马耳他岛海岸发生了剧烈的爆炸。
    过了不久，二十一名被派到塞浦路斯去的英国后备兵坚决要求回家，不愿意战争，以致英国军事当局不得不把他们逮捕起来。
    最近，10月5日，驻扎在马耳他岛上的英国榴弹警卫队约二百人，因反对服兵役举行了大示威。据说，同样的事情也在英国国内发生，为了对埃及进行战争威胁而召集的一万名英国后备兵，都增长着不满的情绪。
    看了这些报道，不禁使人想起一个中国古老的故事：据说，从前有一位喜好征战的将军，骑上一匹战马走上征途，走到半路上，战马忽然悲鸣起来，马蹄被蹩坏了，这位将军赶紧勒住马缰，不禁长叹一声说“此乃不祥之兆也”，于是放弃了征战的打算。这个将军还算是聪明的，因为战马还没有上阵就蹩坏了腿，如果打起仗来是一定会失败的。
    英国为了对埃及进行战争威胁，在地中海进行军事集结，也是在战争的半路上。还没有真正上阵，它的“战马”就出了毛病，当然也不是什么好兆头。要是英国政府也稍有聪明的话，它早就应该勒住马缰，长叹一声，而放弃武力的打算了。
    可是，看来英国政府并没有这种自知之明。据合众社伦敦9日电，英国政府在接到地中海部队新近起哄的报告以后才几小时，就发表了一个正式声明。在声明中，英国政府对后备兵员中的反战情绪的日益发展，虽然表示严重的不安和“遗憾”，但是它仍然要求被召集的后备兵员们“继续服现役”。
    “战马”不愿意走向战争，英国政府硬逼着他们干，是绝对没有什么好结果的！　（晋）
