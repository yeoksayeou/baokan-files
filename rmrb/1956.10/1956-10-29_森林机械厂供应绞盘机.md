Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 26th. The Forest Machinery Factory of the Ministry of Forestry Industry has successfully trial-produced three types of winches this year. To date, eighty-six winches manufactured by this factory have been shipped to the forest areas of Northeast China.

    The manufacture of winches is a happy event for loggers. In the past, felled timber was gathered by loggers using manual lifting and animal-powered dragging methods, and then manually loaded onto vehicles for transport. This backward method of gathering and loading not only increased the physical labor of the workers but also was incompatible with mechanized transportation. The three types of winches manufactured by the Forest Machinery Factory include one for gathering timber, one for loading vehicles, and one that can both gather timber and load vehicles.

    森林机械厂供应绞盘机
    新华社哈尔滨26日电　森林工业部森林机械厂今年先后试制成功三种绞盘机。到目前为止，这个厂制造的八十六台绞盘机运到了东北的林区。
    绞盘机的制造，是伐木工人的喜事。过去，伐木工人伐倒的木材，都是用人工抬、畜力拖的办法集中起来，然后再由人工装到车上运走。这种落后的集材、装车方法，既加重了工人的体力劳动，又同机械化的运输不相适应。森林机械厂制造的三种绞盘机，一种能集材，一种能装车，还有一种既能集材又能装车。
