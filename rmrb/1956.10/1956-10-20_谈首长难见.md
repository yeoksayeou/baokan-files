    On the Difficulty of Seeing Leaders
    Yi Huai
    At a conference held by a leading organization in Beijing, someone mentioned the following incident: A factory director came to Beijing to seek help from the minister in resolving some issues. However, after staying in Beijing for a long time, waiting and waiting, the minister was always busy and unavailable. The factory director, in desperation, found a trick: he sent a telegram to the minister from the guesthouse, requesting a meeting to discuss the matter.
    This seems like a joke. It might be considered a joke, because such things are, after all, not very common. But we should also ask, why is such a joke circulating? In fact, the problem lies here: it is often not easy for many comrades at the grassroots level, when encountering relatively major and urgent problems in their work, to find senior leading cadres to help solve them. The first hurdle is the inability to meet with the leading comrades. These comrades travel thousands of miles to Beijing, call today, and the secretary refuses, saying there is a meeting; call again tomorrow, and they are still busy. Sometimes, the secretary might even lightly lecture them: The leader is so busy, is there anything so important that you have to see him? The unspoken implication seems to be that the person seeking the meeting is not "aware of the times." After finally arranging a time, you excitedly go as agreed, only to be disappointed again. The secretary apologizes, saying the leader had to go out on urgent business... In this way, a problem that could have been resolved in three or two hours, or even less time, requires the comrades from below to stay in Beijing for ten days and a half months or even longer. Moreover, this is not only the case in Beijing; it is equally difficult to see leaders in provincial-level organizations. At the First Party Congress of Hebei Province, some representatives pointed out that when they came to the province with problems and wanted to find leading comrades to help solve them, they often had to wait for many days without getting a meeting. At the Jiangsu Provincial Party Congress, some representatives also criticized that responsible cadres from farms who came to the province to see the responsible comrades of the Agricultural and Forestry Department had to stay in the guesthouse and wait for half a month.
    Perhaps some people will say that these comrades are making trouble for themselves. The leading organs are so large, with such a detailed division of labor, and everything is managed by specialists. Why do they have to find the leaders for everything? This sounds very reasonable, but it is also worth listening to the opinions of the comrades at the grassroots level. Not long ago, a factory director complained to me about the difficulty of seeing leaders: The ministry and bureau have a very detailed division of labor. Each unit considers problems from the perspective of its own area of responsibility. Today, this division or department wants the grassroots to set up such an organization, and tomorrow that division or department wants the grassroots to add such equipment. However, the divisions or departments that manage personnel and money often either do not provide people or do not provide money. Some things, this department thinks should be done immediately from this perspective, while another department thinks should be postponed from another perspective. It is truly a case of each having their own reasons, no wonder many factory directors say: "There are many mothers-in-law, but no real mother." Moreover, those who come to ask for instructions are mostly major or urgent problems that involve many aspects and require a comprehensive consideration of priorities and an overall plan. May I ask, if these problems are not brought to the leaders, what can the grassroots do? If the leading organs are large and there is no one to comprehensively consider and solve problems, then they will not only not be of much benefit to the lower levels, but will also become artificial obstacles between the upper and lower levels.
    Some people also feel sorry for the leaders! It is not that they are unwilling to personally receive lower-level cadres who come to ask for instructions and report, but they are really too busy and "cannot be in two places at once"! We believe that there are indeed no such leading comrades who are clearly idle and unwilling to meet with lower-level cadres. Even if there are, they are extremely rare and can be ignored. It is also true that meeting notices are lined up on the desks of leading cadres and documents are piled up. But the problem lies in how the leading cadres arrange these many things. If viewed in isolation, it can be said that the meetings that leading cadres have to attend and the documents they have to read are all important and cannot be reduced. However, no matter how important they are, if they cause many leading cadres to be completely trapped in meeting rooms and piles of documents, unable to solve the practical problems in the work of the lower levels, then it is worth considering. As leading cadres, if they only assign tasks to the lower levels without helping to solve the various problems in completing the tasks, then they are not leading but engaging in bureaucracy. Letting factory directors or other comrades who come to ask for instructions wait in the guesthouse for many days, you should know that this wastes not only their several working days, but also wastes the time of our country's socialist industrialization, and wastes the socialist enthusiasm of thousands of workers and peasants. When the people who ask for instructions are anxiously waiting in the guesthouse, it is also when the safety of people and equipment, the quality of products, the progress of projects, the lives of the masses, and even work and production plans are threatened at the grassroots level. If the leading cadres consider these things, they should say that they will arrange things according to their importance and urgency. Of course, this is not an easy task, and it is often not a problem that one organization can solve. However, every leading comrade might consider: What work have you done yourself in changing this situation, and how much necessary struggle have you carried out? You might also consider whether you sometimes prefer to go to meetings or read documents rather than talk to lower-level cadres, so as to avoid contact with those troublesome specific problems? Or do you have the kind of attitude that Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his report on revising the Party Constitution: "Unwilling to approach the masses, not caring about the sufferings of the masses, and not actively solving the problems that the masses urgently demand to be solved, but holding a indifferent attitude of indifference."

    谈首长难见
    易槐
    在北京一个领导机关召开的会议上，有人谈起了这样一件事：一位厂长到北京来要找部长帮助解决一些问题。可是，到北京住了很久，左等右等，部长总是有事见不了面。这位厂长等急了，就找了一个窍门，从招待所里给部长拍电报请求见面谈话。
    这好像是笑话。把它当做笑话也未始不可，因为，这样的事情毕竟不多。可是也还应该追问一下，为什么会有这样的笑话流传呢？其实，问题就在这里：下边很多同志工作中遇到比较重大的急迫的问题，要找上级领导干部帮助解决，常常并不是一件很容易的事。头一个难关就是和领导同志见不了面。这些同志跋涉千里来到北京，今天打电话，秘书挡了驾，说是开会；明天再打电话，还是有事，有时，说不定还要被秘书同志轻轻地教训几句：首长这么忙，有什么大不了的事非要找他不行呢？言外之意似乎求见的人很不识“时务”；好容易约好了一个时间，可是当你兴致勃勃地如约赶去的时候，不料又是扑空，秘书说声抱歉，首长临时又有事出去了……。就这样，本来谈上三两小时甚至更短的时间就可以解决的问题，下边的同志就得在北京住上十天半月或者更久。而且，不仅北京如此，到省一级机关要见首长同样也不容易。在河北省第一次党代表大会上，有些代表就提出了，到省里来有问题想找首长帮助解决，往往要一等好多天还见不到面。江苏省党代表大会上，有的代表也提出了这样的批评：农场的负责干部到省里要见一见农林厅的负责同志，住在招待所一等就是半个月。
    也许有人会说这些同志是自找麻烦，领导机关那么大，分工那么细致，事事有人专管，有事何必一定要找首长呢？这话听来很有道理，可是，也不妨听听下边同志们的意见。不久前，有位厂长同志曾经向我诉过首长难见的苦：部、局分工很细，各个单位从他们所掌管的业务的角度考虑问题，今天这个司或处要下边设置一个这样的机构，明天那个司或处又要下边添置一个那样的设备，而另外的管人的管钱的司或处却往往不是不给人就是不给钱。有些事，这个部门从这个角度考虑觉得应该立刻就做，另外的部门从另外的角度考虑又觉得应该缓做。真是公说公有理，婆说婆有理，无怪乎很多厂长说：“婆婆很多，亲娘没有”。而且，下边来请示的，大多是牵扯很多需要从全局着眼权衡轻重统盘考虑的重大问题或急迫问题，请问，这些问题不找首长，下边又怎么办呢？领导机关机构庞大而又没有人全面考虑解决问题，对于下级来说，它就不但不会有多大好处，而且会成为上下级之间的人为障碍。
    有人也很替首长们做难！他们不是不愿意亲自接见来请示报告的下级干部，实在是因为太忙，“分身无术”啊！我们相信，的确不会有那样自己明明闲着，而又不愿和下级干部见面的领导同志，即或有，也是极其个别的，可以不谈他们。领导干部的办公桌上开会通知排队、文件成堆也的确是事实。但是问题在于领导干部把这许许多多事情怎样安排。如果孤立起来看，可以说，领导干部所要参加的会议，批阅的文件都是重要的，没法减少的。可是，不管它们多么重要，如果弄得很多领导干部完全陷在会议室文件堆中，不能为下级解决工作中的实际问题，那就值得考虑了。做为领导干部，如果对下边只布置任务，不帮助解决完成任务中的各种问题，那就不是领导而是官僚主义了。让厂长或者其他来请示的同志们在招待所一等多少天，要知道这样做浪费的不止是他们的几个工作日，而是浪费我们国家社会主义工业化的时间，浪费成千上万的工人和农民的社会主义积极性，当请示的人们住在招待所里着急的时候，也就是下边多少人和设备的安全、产品的质量、工程的进度、群众的生活以至工作、生产计划受着威胁的时候。如果领导干部考虑到这些，应该说就会去把事情分别轻重缓急加以安排的。当然，这并不是容易的事，往往也并不是一个机关能解决的问题。可是，每一个领导同志不妨考虑一下：在改变这种状况方面究竟自己做了些什么工作，进行了多少必要的斗争？也还可以考虑一下，有时候是不是也宁愿去开会或看文件而不愿去和下级干部谈话，免得接触那些令人头疼的具体问题？或者是有着像邓小平同志在关于修改党的章程的报告中所指出的那种：“不愿意接近群众，不关心群众的痛痒，对于群众要求迫切解决的问题，不是积极地去解决，而是抱着一种无动于中的冷淡态度。”
