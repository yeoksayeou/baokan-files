Xinhua News Agency, October 17th - Middle Eastern public opinion welcomes the outcome of the United Nations Security Council's discussion on the Suez Canal issue, and praises the Soviet Union's just stance. The Lebanese newspaper "Al Bayrak" wrote that the result of the Security Council's discussion on the Suez issue is a victory for the forces of peace and another failure of the policies adopted by Western countries in the Middle East.

An editorial in the Syrian "Al-Nasr" emphasized that, thanks to the Soviet Union's support, the Security Council unanimously adopted the six principles for resolving the Suez issue, and rejected the second part of the Anglo-French proposal, which stipulated the internationalization of the canal. The newspaper wrote: "The result of the discussion on the Suez issue makes us express our warm gratitude for the noble position taken by the Soviet Union on this issue, which once again demonstrates the great significance of this great country's friendship with the Arabs."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi - The "Hindustan Standard" published an editorial on the 16th, saying: "People everywhere are expressing widespread satisfaction with the Security Council's handling of the Suez dispute. With the Security Council unanimously adopting the principle of further negotiations, and the Soviet Union rejecting unilateral steps to control the canal, the opportunity for a peaceful resolution is now greatly increased."

The newspaper said: "This veto not only prevents the forced implementation of external control against Egypt's wishes, but it also helps future negotiations among the parties concerned."

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, October 17th - The "Burman" newspaper published an editorial today, saying: "Russia's veto has saved Egypt from an international conspiracy that would violate its sovereignty."

The newspaper pointed out: This "shows that the veto has its uses, and for quite a long time to come, the veto must continue to be maintained in the Security Council, and only by using this method can harmful decisions be prevented during this period."

An editorial in the "Myanmar New Light of Burma" also praised the Soviet Union for vetoing the second part of the Anglo-French proposal in the Security Council, which attempted to force Egypt to accept international control measures over the Suez Canal.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 17th - The "Rude Pravo" published an editorial on the 16th, saying that the unanimous adoption of the six principles in the joint Anglo-French proposal by the United Nations Security Council is the first successful step on the road to a fair resolution of the Suez Canal issue.

"Rude Pravo" pointed out that the basis of the second part of the Anglo-French proposal, the so-called "Eighteen Nation Plan," is full of power politics. This is a blatant attempt by Britain and France to "correct" the formal concessions they made in the first part of the new proposal.

"Rude Pravo" added that, despite these attempts, the Security Council's negotiations have brought the Suez Canal issue out of a dead end, thanks to the Security Council's unanimous adoption of the six principles. The newspaper said that this is primarily due to the Soviet Union's efforts, which prevented Britain and France from undermining this achievement.

Xinhua News Agency, London, October 14th - TASS - British public opinion attaches great importance to the agreement on the six principles reached between the Anglo-French representatives and the Egyptian representatives on the Suez issue.

Many commentators directly or indirectly believe that the agreement reached on the six common principles for resolving this issue shows that adopting negotiation methods in international relations is effective.

Some commentators believe that the reaching of the "six principles" agreement has dealt a spiritual blow to the advocates of power politics. The newspapers also pointed out that although the prospects for resolving the Suez issue have improved slightly, there are still serious difficulties to overcome, because Western countries insist on their demands, which are unacceptable to Egypt.

    国际舆论欢迎安理会的决定
    赞扬苏联在苏伊士问题上伸张正义
    英报指出六项原则的协议表明通过谈判解决国际纠纷是有成效的
    新华社17日讯　中近东的舆论欢迎联合国安全理事会讨论苏伊士运河问题的结果，并且赞扬苏联的正义立场。黎巴嫩报纸“邻人报”写道，安全理事会对苏伊士问题的讨论结果是和平力量的胜利和西方国家在中近东所采取的政策的又一次失败。
    叙利亚“胜利报”的社论着重指出，由于苏联的支持，安全理事会一致通过了解决苏伊士问题的六项原则，并且否决了英法提案中规定运河国际化的第二部分。这家报纸写道：“苏伊士问题的讨论结果，使得我们对于苏联在这个问题上所采取的高尚立场表示热烈感谢，这种立场又一次表现出这个伟大的国家对阿拉伯人的友谊的重大意义。”
    据新华社新德里电　“印度斯坦旗报”16日发表社论说：“各个地方的人都对安全理事会关于苏伊士纠纷的处理表示普遍的满意。由于安全理事会一致通过进一步谈判的原则，同时苏联否决了要求控制运河的片面步骤，和平解决的机会在目前大大增加了。”
    这家报纸说：“这次否决不仅阻止了不顾埃及的反对而强制实行外来控制的做法，它也帮助了有关各方面今后的谈判。”
    据新华社仰光17日电　“缅甸人报”今天发表社论说：“俄国的否决权已经使埃及免受一种侵犯它的主权的国际阴谋之害。”
    这家报纸指出：这“表明，否决权自有它的用处，在今后相当长的一段时间内，必须在安全理事会继续保持否决权，在这段时间内，只有使用这种办法才能防止有害的决定。”
    “缅甸新光报”的社论也称赞苏联在安全理事会中否决了英法提案的第二部分，这一部分企图强迫埃及接受国际管制苏伊士运河的措施。
    据新华社布拉格17日电　16日的“红色权利报”发表社论说，联合国安全理事会一致通过英法联合提案中的六项原则，是走向苏伊士运河问题公正解决的道路上的第一个成功的步骤。
    “红色权利报”指出，英法提案的第二部分的基础，即所谓“十八国方案”充满着实力政策的色彩。这是英国和法国露骨的尝试，想把它们在新提案的第一部分中所做的正式让步加以“纠正”。
    “红色权利报”又说，尽管有这些尝试，但是，由于安全理事会一致通过了六项原则，安理会的谈判已经使苏伊士运河问题走出了死胡同。报纸说，这首先是由于苏联的努力，才使英国和法国没有能够破坏这个成就。
    据新华社讯　塔斯社伦敦14日讯：英国舆论界非常重视英法代表与埃及代表之间就苏伊士问题达成的六项原则协议。
    许多评论员直接或间接地认为，已经达成的关于解决这一问题的六项共同原则的协议，表明在国际关系中采取谈判方法是有成效的。
    有些评论家认为，“六项原则”协议的达成，给了武力政策拥护者们以精神上的打击。各报也指出，虽然解决苏伊士问题的前景稍有好转，但是还有严重的困难待克服，因为西方国家坚持自己的要求，而这些要求是埃及所不能接受的。
