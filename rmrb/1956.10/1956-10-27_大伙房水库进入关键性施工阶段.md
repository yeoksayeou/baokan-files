Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 25th. The Dahuo房 Reservoir has entered a critical construction stage. The water diversion tunnel, which runs through the South Mountain for more than 500 meters, has been completed, and the iron gate weighing dozens of tons at the tunnel entrance was installed on October 17th. The more than three-mile-long dam has been built to a height of eighteen or nineteen meters, connecting the mountains on both sides of the Hun River. Now, the water of the Hun River is compressed into a 20-meter-wide closure gap flowing downstream.

After the completion of the water diversion tunnel project, the main force was put into the dam closure project. More than 10,000 cubic meters of stones, sand, and clay used for the dam closure are being mined, and the railway transporting sand and gravel has been laid from the sand and gravel field to the closure gap. The cofferdam and revetment protecting the dam have been repaired. The railway tracks have now been laid on the two large bridges built at the closure gap. During the closure, two rows of locomotives will use the fastest speed to simultaneously throw stones and sand into the dragon opening from these two bridges to block the rapid flow of the gap. Xue Jiuling, who has 59 years of experience in blocking the Yellow River, has come here to help with the closure project.

    大伙房水库进入关键性施工阶段
    新华社沈阳25日电　大伙房水库进入关键性施工阶段。贯穿南山长达五百多公尺的输水道已经打通，输水道道口数十吨重的铁闸门在10月17日安好。三里多长的拦河大坝已经筑到十八九公尺高，连接起浑河两岸山岭。现在，浑河的水被压缩在二十公尺宽的合龙口流入下游。
    输水道工程完成后，主要的力量都投入大坝合龙工程。大坝合龙用的一万多立方公尺的石头，砂土和粘土正在采掘，运砂石料的铁道已从砂石场铺到合龙口。保护大坝的围堰、护坡都已修好。在合龙口修建的两座大桥上，现在已铺上铁轨。在合龙的时候，两排机车要用最快的速度，同时在这两座桥上望龙口抛石子和砂子，来堵塞缺口的激流。在黄河有五十九年堵口经验的薛九龄已经来到这里帮助合龙工程。
