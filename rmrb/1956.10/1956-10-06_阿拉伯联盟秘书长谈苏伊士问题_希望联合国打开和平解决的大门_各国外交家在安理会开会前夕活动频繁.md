Xinhua News Agency, October 5th, Cairo News: On the eve of the United Nations Security Council debate on the Suez issue, Arab League Secretary-General Abdul Khaleq Hassouna issued a statement expressing hope that the United Nations can open the door to resolving the Suez Canal issue through peaceful and consultative methods.
　　Hassouna said on October 4 that there is now hope that the Security Council can pave the way for a solution that "satisfies Egypt while providing other countries with a face-saving way out."
　　He said that this issue could be resolved through direct negotiations if the Security Council recommends doing so. Hassouna said that as an alternative, the Security Council might establish a body composed of its council members and other relevant countries to consider the issue.
　　Xinhua News Agency, October 5th, New York News: On the eve of the United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss the Suez Canal issue, diplomats from various countries launched frequent pre-meeting activities.
　　Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov, Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi, and Yugoslav Foreign Secretary Popovic held talks on the 4th. Fawzi also met with Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, Peruvian representative Belaunde, and Iranian representative Abdoh on the same day to discuss the Suez Canal issue with them.
　　British Foreign Secretary Lloyd also met with Shepilov, Popovic, and Abdoh on the 4th. In addition to holding lengthy meetings with his advisors to draft proposals to be submitted to the Security Council, Lloyd also held talks with French Foreign Minister Pineau and Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak on the same day.
　　After arriving in New York on the 4th, Pineau met with United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld. At the same time, the US State Department announced that Dulles will depart from Washington for New York on the 5th.
　　Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Libya, and Jordan, seven Arab countries, wrote to the President of the Security Council, French representative Gornic-Zanti, on the 4th, requesting to participate in the Security Council's discussion on the Suez Canal issue. Prior to this, Israel also requested to participate in the discussion. However, it is said that the requests of the Arab countries and Israel were opposed by Britain. According to Reuters, the British side believes that if Israel and Arab countries other than Egypt are given the opportunity to speak, the Suez issue will be "confused" and will create the possibility of raising the entire Palestinian issue.

    阿拉伯联盟秘书长谈苏伊士问题
    希望联合国打开和平解决的大门
    各国外交家在安理会开会前夕活动频繁
    新华社5日讯　开罗消息：阿拉伯联盟秘书长阿卜杜勒—哈勒克·哈苏纳在联合国安全理事会辩论苏伊士问题的前夕发表谈话，表示希望联合国能够打开用和平的和协商的方法来解决苏伊士运河问题的大门。
    哈苏纳10月4日说，现在存在着这样的希望：安全理事会能够为“既满足埃及同时又为其他国家提供保全面子的出路”的解决办法铺平道路。
    他说，这个问题能够通过直接谈判得到解决，如果安全理事会建议这样做的话。哈苏纳说，作为一种替代办法，安全理事会可能成立一个由它的理事和其他有关国家组成的机构来考虑这个问题。
    新华社5日讯　纽约消息：在联合国安全理事会开会讨论苏伊士运河问题的前夕，各国外交家展开了频繁的会前活动。
    苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫、埃及外交部长法齐和南斯拉夫外交秘书长波波维奇在4日举行了会谈。法齐这一天还会见了比利时外交大臣斯巴克、秘鲁代表贝朗德和伊朗代表阿卜杜，同他们讨论苏伊士运河问题。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德在4日也分别会见了谢皮洛夫、波波维奇和阿卜杜。劳埃德这一天除了同他的顾问举行长时间的会议拟订向安全理事会提出的提案以外，还同法国外交部长比诺和比利时外交大臣斯巴克会谈。
    比诺在4日到达纽约后会见了联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德。同时，美国国务院宣布，杜勒斯将在5日从华盛顿启程到纽约。
    叙利亚、黎巴嫩、也门、沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克、利比亚和约旦七个阿拉伯国家4日写信给安全理事会主席、法国代表戈尔尼—让蒂，要求参加安全理事会关于苏伊士运河问题的讨论。在这以前，以色列也要求参加讨论。但是据说阿拉伯国家和以色列的要求遭到英国的反对。据路透社消息说，英国方面认为，如果给予以色列和除埃及以外的阿拉伯国家以发言的机会，就会使苏伊士问题搞得“混乱不清”，并且会造成一种把整个巴勒斯坦问题提出来的可能性。
