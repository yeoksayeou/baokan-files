This Situation Cannot But Shock and Outrage People!

As of the afternoon of the 12th, the British authorities in Hong Kong have not taken effective measures to stop the riots created by Kuomintang secret agents in Kowloon. Now, the riots in Kowloon are spreading to new areas, causing new and significant casualties. At the same time, there are signs that the rioters are developing towards Hong Kong. This situation cannot but shock people.

Ironclad facts prove that this incident was deliberately created by Kuomintang secret agents. This is obvious to the Chinese and foreign residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon, and has also been reported by many foreign news agencies. However, the US-Chiang news agencies distorted the truth of this fact, attempting to exonerate the crimes of the Kuomintang secret agents. They attempted to shift the responsibility for this incident onto so-called Communist Chinese. This is a shameful lie! The entire riot was clearly a frenzied attack by Kuomintang secret agents on schools, shops, and factories, looting residents, destroying buses, and burning buildings, causing casualties to a large number of peaceful residents, not even sparing pregnant women. Hong Kong's "South China Morning Post" also severely condemned the Kuomintang elements for launching this riot in its editorial on the 12th and advocated removing these scum. This is a brutal attack by Kuomintang secret agents on the peaceful residents of Hong Kong, and in no way can this incident be shifted onto so-called Communist Chinese. The distortion by the US-Chiang news agencies is merely an attempt to cover up their own ugly faces. But this is ultimately impossible.

Obviously, the Hong Kong authorities cannot but be held responsible for the expansion of this riot. Although the riot has continued for two days and has developed to such a rampant degree, and although the Hong Kong authorities have repeatedly announced their determination to suppress the riot, the Hong Kong authorities have not only failed to take effective measures to stop it, but have instead described the atrocities of the Kuomintang secret agents as a conflict between two factions of Chinese, or as a factional struggle between members of left-wing and right-wing movements, for which the Hong Kong police and British army bear no responsibility. This attitude of the Hong Kong authorities cannot but make the Chinese people extremely indignant. At the same time, people cannot but doubt whether the Hong Kong authorities intend to stop the atrocities of the Kuomintang secret agents against peaceful residents, or whether they deliberately intend to create the impression of a so-called conflict between two factions of Chinese, and stand by as onlookers to shirk their own responsibility.

We firmly demand that the Hong Kong authorities stop this absurd propaganda and immediately take resolute measures to stop the riot and severely punish the Kuomintang secret agents. The Chinese government and people cannot turn a blind eye to the serious threats faced by our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon!

    这种情况不能不令人震惊和愤慨！
    截止12日下午，香港英国当局还没有采取有效措施制止国民党特务分子在九龙制造的暴乱。现在，在九龙的暴乱行为正在向新的地区发展，正在造成新的重大死伤，同时，暴乱者又有向香港发展的迹象。这种情况不能不令人感到震惊。
    铁的事实证明这次事件是国民党特务分子蓄意制造的。这本是港九中外居民有目共睹的事，同时也是许多外国通讯社所报道了的。但是，美蒋通讯社却歪曲这个事实的真相，企图开脱国民党特务分子的罪行。他们企图把这次事件的责任转嫁到所谓共产党中国人的身上。这是可耻的谎言！整个暴乱明明是国民党特务分子疯狂地袭击学校、商店和工厂，抢劫居民，捣毁公共汽车，焚烧建筑物，使大批和平居民遭受伤亡，甚至连孕妇也不能幸免。香港的“南华早报”在它12日的社论中也提出严厉谴责国民党分子发动这次暴乱，并且主张去掉这些败类。这是一个国民党特务分子对香港和平居民的横暴进攻，在任何意义上都不能把这次事件转嫁到所谓共产党中国人的身上。美蒋通讯社的歪曲只不过是想掩盖他们自己的丑恶的面貌。但这究竟是办不到的。
    很显然，香港当局对于这次暴乱的扩大是不能不负责任的。尽管暴乱已经继续了两天之久，并且发展到如此猖獗的程度，尽管香港当局一再宣布决心镇压暴乱，但是香港当局不仅没有采取有效的措施予以制止，反而把国民党特务分子的暴行说成是两派华人的冲突，或者说成是左翼同右翼运动成员之间的派系斗争，香港警察和英军都没有责任。香港当局这种态度不能不使中国人民异常愤慨，同时人们不能不怀疑香港当局究竟是要制止国民党特务分子对和平居民的暴行呢？还是有意制造所谓两派华人冲突的印象，自居于旁观者的地位，来推卸自己的责任呢？
    我们坚决要求香港当局停止这种荒谬的宣传，并且立即采取坚决措施，制止暴乱，严惩国民党特务分子。中国政府和人民对港九中国同胞所受到的严重威胁，不能置若罔闻！
