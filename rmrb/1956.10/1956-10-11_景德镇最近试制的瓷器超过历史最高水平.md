    Jingdezhen Recently Trial-Produced Porcelain Exceeds Historical High Levels
    (Our newspaper dispatch) A batch of porcelain recently trial-produced by Jingdezhen for the state, according to the appraisal of Zhou Ren, a metallurgical and ceramic expert from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, etc., is of better quality than historical levels. The styles and images of blue and white porcelain and famille rose porcelain have also reached the highest historical levels.
  Historically, the best porcelain quality in China was during the Kangxi and Qianlong eras, known as "pure white and lustrous, without a cloud in ten thousand miles." The blue and white style of the Xuande era was known for being "grand and vigorous," while the colors of the Kangxi era were known for being "bright and stable." The famille rose of the Yongzheng era was the best, known as "magnificent and vivid, with bright colors." However, from the Daoguang era onwards, especially during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the quality of porcelain deteriorated. Only after liberation did it gradually return to its original characteristics. At the end of July this year, the central government assigned the task of producing porcelain for national use to Jingdezhen and required it to generally reach and exceed the highest historical level. It was also proposed to first produce good samples. After more than a month of efforts by Jingdezhen ceramic workers, they overcame the difficulties brought about by changing the formula, changing the kiln temperature, insufficient fire resistance of saggars, and the lack of good vermilion materials. Finally, they successfully completed the trial production of this batch of porcelain samples for national use.

### 景德镇最近试制的瓷器超过历史最高水平

    景德镇最近试制的瓷器超过历史最高水平
    本报讯　景德镇最近为国家试制的一批瓷器，据中国科学院冶金陶瓷专家周仁等鉴定，认为瓷质超过了历史上的水平，青花和粉采的风格画面也达到了历史最高水平。
  我国历史上瓷质以康熙和乾隆时代最好，号称“洁白光润，万里无云”。宣德时代青花风格有“大方蓬勃”之称，康熙时代颜色有“鲜明安定”之称，粉末以雍正时代最佳，称为“富丽生动、颜色鲜明”。可是从道光时代以后，特别是在国民党反动统治时期，瓷质每况愈下，解放后才又逐步恢复原来的特点。今年7月底，中央向景德镇交下国家用瓷任务，并要求普遍达到和超过历史最高水平。并提出要先把样品试制好。经过景德镇陶瓷工人一个多月的努力，克服了改变配方、改变窑温、匣钵耐火度不够和没有好的朱明料等所带来的困难，终于胜利完成这批国家用瓷样品的试制工作。
