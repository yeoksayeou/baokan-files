Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 5th: The draft of the five-year plan for the development of the national economy from 1956 to 1960, formulated by the Polish Council of Ministers, stipulates that Poland's total socialist industrial output value should increase by 53% between 1956 and 1960; the average increase of real wages of workers and staff and the real income of farmers should not be less than 30% in five years.

The draft, published by Polish newspapers on October 3rd, said that during the six-year plan period, the People's Republic of Poland had made great strides in developing productive forces and carrying out socialist transformation of social relations. The gap in economic development level between Poland and the most industrialized countries has been greatly reduced, and Poland's national defense capabilities have been greatly strengthened.

The draft also pointed out that in the process of completing the six-year plan, some delays and imbalances occurred in the development of the national economy, which were related to objective difficulties and serious errors in economic policy. For these reasons, the tasks of the six-year plan were not successfully completed in all sectors. In particular, it was not possible to satisfactorily complete the task of raising the people's living standards.

The draft pointed out that the main task of the five-year plan is to improve the people's livelihood as much as possible under the then-existing conditions, on the basis of further comprehensive development of production.

By the end of the five-year plan, industry should produce: 110 million tons of coal, 29.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 5.1 million tons of pig iron, and 7.2 million tons of steel.

The draft stipulates that agricultural production will increase by almost 25% during the five-year period. During this period, grain harvests will increase by 20%. About 70,600 tractors, more than 10,500 grain combine harvesters, and a large number of other agricultural machines will be supplied to agriculture in five years.

In five years, an atomic reactor and various sizes of cyclotrons will be built, and the construction of the Central Nuclear Research Institute near Warsaw will be completed.

The five-year plan draft stipulates measures to improve the people's living conditions. The sales volume of major consumer goods will be greatly increased, with meat and meat products increasing by 60%, sugar by 41%, silk fabrics by 32%, and leather shoes by 45%. During the five-year period, 1.2 million houses will be built in cities and workers' residential areas.

    波兰发表新五年计划草案
    主要任务是在进一步全面发展生产的基础上大力改善人民生活
    新华社华沙5日电　波兰部长会议制定的1956年—1960年发展国民经济的五年计划草案规定，波兰的社会主义工业总产值在1956年到1960年期间要增长53％；工人和职员的实际工资以及农民的实际收入在五年中的平均增长不得少于30％。
    波兰报纸在10月3日刊载的这个草案说：在六年计划期间，波兰人民共和国在发展生产力和对社会关系进行社会主义改造方面前进了一大步。波兰同工业最发达的国家之间经济发展水平的距离大为缩小，波兰的国防力量大大加强了。
    草案同时指出，在完成六年计划的过程中，在发展国民经济方面产生了一些迟滞和不平衡现象，这是同客观困难和经济政策上的严重错误有关的。由于这些原因就使六年计划的任务未能在一切部门中顺利完成。尤其是在提高人民生活水平方面没有能够圆满地完成。
    草案指出，五年计划的主要任务是在进一步全面发展生产的基础上，在当时条件下尽可能地改善人民的生活。
    到五年计划结束时，工业方面应当生产：煤一亿一千万吨，电力二百九十五亿度，生铁五百一十万吨，钢七百二十万吨。
    草案规定在五年期间农业生产的增加差不多达25％。在这一时期谷物的收获量将提高20％。五年中将供给农业约七万零六百台拖拉机，一万零五百多台谷物联合收割机和大量的其他的农业机器。
    五年中要建造一个原子反应堆和各种大小的回旋加速器，并且要完成华沙附近的中央核子研究所的建设工作。
    五年计划草案规定了改善人民生活条件的措施。主要消费品的销售量将要大大增加，肉类和肉制品将增加60％，糖将增加41％，丝织品将增加32％，皮鞋将增加45％。五年期间在城市和工人居住区将建筑一百二十万间住房。
