Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 24th: Saigon dispatch: The South Vietnamese "Constituent Assembly" completely passed Ngô Đình Diệm's "Constitution" late on October 21st. This "Constitution," aimed at splitting Vietnam, will be promulgated by Ngô Đình Diệm on October 26th, celebrating the first anniversary of the founding of the South Vietnamese "Republic."

The South Vietnamese "Constituent Assembly" was ordered on October 15th to re-discuss and finally pass this "Constitution" of Ngô Đình Diệm's.

Due to the manipulation of Ngô Đình Diệm's elements, the "Constituent Assembly," during the re-discussion, still passed some clauses that had been criticized for infringing upon the people's democratic freedoms, such as stipulating that, in addition to judicial organs, other "relevant organs" also have the right to arrest people. At the same time, it rejected some of the deputies' demands, such as the request to add a provision to the "Constitution" that freedom of speech should include freedom of newspaper printing and distribution.

According to this already passed "Constitution," Ngô Đình Diệm not only controls the military and political power of South Vietnam and manipulates the judicial department, but he is also the chairman of the South Vietnamese "Supreme Court Conference," and at the same time, he has turned the legislative "National Assembly" into a subordinate agency. He can not only replace and force the "National Assembly" to promulgate laws, but also control the term of office of the "National Assembly" and dissolve the "National Assembly."

Some Saigon newspapers, in commenting on this "Constitution," revealed a sense of dissatisfaction. The "Democracy Daily" believes that this "Constitution" is "deliberately creating" conditions for establishing a "dictatorial system."

    吴庭艳进一步扼杀人民的民主自由
    南越“制宪议会”通过独裁“宪法”
    据新华社河内24日电　西贡消息：南越“制宪议会”已经在10月21日深夜全部通过了吴庭艳“宪法”。这个目的在分裂越南的“宪法”将要在10月26日庆祝南越“共和国”成立一周年的时候，由吴庭艳公布。
    南越“制宪议会”是在10月15日奉命重新讨论和最后通过吴庭艳的这部“宪法”的。
    由于吴庭艳分子的操纵，“制宪议会”在重新讨论中还是通过了一些曾经遭到抨击的侵犯人民民主自由的条款，如规定除了司法机关以外，其他“有关的机关”也有权逮捕人等。同时拒绝了一些议员提出的要求，如拒绝在“宪法”中补充规定言论自由一项应该包括报纸印刷和发行自由等。
    根据这部已经通过的“宪法”，吴庭艳不仅掌握了南越的军政大权，操纵了司法部门，他还是南越“最高审判会议”主席，同时还把立法机关的“国会”变成了他的下级机构。他不但能够代替和强迫“国会”颁布法令，而且又能够左右“国会”的任期和解散“国会”。
    一些西贡报纸在评论这部“宪法”时，流露出不满的情绪。“民主报”认为这部“宪法”是为建立“独裁制度”“故意制造”条件。
