Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: The Singapore authorities today continued to transfer British troops and police from the Federation of Malaya to suppress residents opposing persecution. A British military spokesperson said that a total of four thousand British troops had been transferred to Singapore from the Federation of Malaya.

Today, the Singapore authorities imposed martial law throughout the day. Military police patrolled the streets and set up roadblocks in various locations. Residents were only allowed on the streets to purchase food for two hours, from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM. According to Reuters, some disturbances occurred during these two hours, and one school was burned down.

The Singapore authorities have ordered all schools to close on October 29th.

The Singapore authorities began taking a series of measures in September, such as disbanding social organizations and arresting trade union staff, teachers, and students, which aroused dissatisfaction among the broad masses of residents. On October 26th, the Singapore authorities further adopted the means of armed suppression of striking students, causing clashes between the police and the masses of residents. Between October 26th and 27th, fourteen people were killed, more than one hundred were injured and hospitalized, and hundreds were arrested by the police. During these two days, Singapore fell into chaos.

    新加坡当局在9月间开始采取解散社会团体和逮捕工会工作人员、教师和学生等一系列措施，激起了广大居民阶层的不满。新加坡当局在10月26日进一步采取武装镇压罢课学生的手段，引起了警察同居民群众的冲突事件。在10月26日和27日间，有十四人被打死，受伤后在医院留医的有一百多人，被警察逮捕的有数百人。在这两天，新加坡陷入混乱状态。
