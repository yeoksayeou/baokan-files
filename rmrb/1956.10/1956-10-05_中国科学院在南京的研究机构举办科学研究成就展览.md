Xinhua News Agency Report: An exhibition of the seven-year research work of various research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Nanjing opened in Nanjing on the 1st.

The exhibition is divided into six exhibition rooms, showcasing the achievements of the six research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences located in Nanjing over the past seven years. The achievements of soil scientists at the Soil Research Institute who conducted soil surveys in Northeast, Northwest, South China, and North China over the past seven years are on display at the exhibition. They studied soil erosion in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River, addressed the problem of preventing soil erosion in the Yellow River basin, and conducted research on preventing secondary soil salinization in the irrigated areas of the lower reaches of the Yellow River. They also surveyed the entire red soil area in South China, studied the problem of phosphorus deficiency in red soil, and found a type of radish that absorbs phosphate fertilizer, which can be used as green manure to increase rice yield by 46%. In recent years, soil scientists have summarized all the results of soil science research in China and compiled the Soil Map of China and the Soil Regionalization Map, providing a scientific basis for national economic construction.

Before 1955, most of the staff of the Paleontology Research Institute participated in geological exploration, conducting work on coal, iron, manganese, phosphorus, petroleum, as well as reservoir and railway engineering geology, and stratigraphic research. They also identified a large number of fossil specimens for the field work teams of the Ministry of Geology and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, and compiled the professional book "Chinese Standard Fossils." Si Xingjian, Director of the Paleontology Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, wrote two million words after liberation, which is close to the work he did in the nineteen years before liberation. These are all on display at the exhibition.

The Institute of Geography conducted large-scale surveys for the development of river basins. In recent years, it has conducted natural geography and economic geography surveys in the Yellow River and Heilongjiang River basins. The land area surveyed by this institute accounts for 20% of the total land area of the country. They also compiled 1:200,000 topographic maps for the Yellow River and Haihe River basins, and 108 maps have been completed, which have become the basic data for various constructions in these basins. The geodetic survey work of this institute is a newly established discipline. In the past seven years, they have conducted astronomical, gravity, and triangulation surveys in Northeast, Northwest, and Huaihe River basins.

The Zijinshan Observatory has begun research on astrophysics and observation of sunspots. In terms of positional astronomy, they discovered two minor planets. Astronomers have also made significant achievements in improving the accuracy of timekeeping. In addition, they have compiled many astronomical almanacs, nautical calendars, and aviation calendars, which have been applied to economic construction and national defense construction.

The results of experimental research at the Zhongshan Botanical Garden show that more than 400 kinds of plants that were previously considered difficult to root can be introduced and cultivated.

    中国科学院在南京的研究机构举办科学研究成就展览
    据新华社讯　中国科学院南京各研究机构七年来研究工作展览会，1日在南京开幕。
    这个展览会分六个展览室，展出了中国科学院设在南京的六个研究机构七年来的成就。土壤研究所的科学工作者七年来在东北、西北、华南、华北等地区进行土壤调查的成就，陈列在展览会上。他们在黄河中上游研究了土壤侵蚀，防止黄河水土流失的问题，在黄河下游灌溉区进行了防止土壤次生盐渍化的研究；在华南调查了全部红壤地区，研究了红壤缺磷的问题，找到了一种吸收磷肥的萝卜菜，可以作为绿肥施用，能使水稻产量提高46％。几年来，土壤科学工作者总结了我国土壤科学研究的全部成果，编制了中国土壤图和土壤分区图，为国家经济建设提供了一种科学依据。
    古生物研究所在1955年以前，绝大部分人员参加了地质勘探，进行了煤、铁、锰、磷、石油以及水库、铁路工程地质、地层研究等项工作，并为地质部、石油工业部的野外工作队鉴定了大量的化石标本，编写了“中国标准化石”专业书籍。同时还发表了一百八十二篇学术论文。中国科学院古生物研究所所长斯行健在解放后的著作有二百万言，接近解放前十九年的工作。这些都陈列在展览会上。
    地理研究所为流域的开发进行了大规模的调查，几年来，在黄河、黑龙江等流域进行了自然地理和经济地理的调查。经过这个研究所调查的土地面积占全国土地总面积20％。他们还为黄河、海河流域编制了二十万分之一的地形图，已经完成了一百零八幅，这些图已成为这些流域的各项建设的基本资料。这个研究所的大地测量工作是新建立的学科，七年来他们在东北、西北、淮河进行了天文、重力和三角测量。
    紫金山天文台已经开始了天体物理的研究、太阳黑子的观测。在方位天文方面，他们发现了两颗小行星。天文学家在提高授时的精确度方面，也有了显著的成绩。此外，他们还编了不少的天文年历、航海历和航空历，已经应用到经济建设和国防建设上去。
    中山植物园试验研究的结果表明：已有四百多种以往认为不易生根的植物可以引种栽培。
