　　Surpassing the Past Thirty Years
　　Wu Jingye, Chief of the Process Department, First Automobile Works
　　Re-enrolling as a Student
　　In March 1953, before I set off for Changchun, an engineer said to me, "Go ahead, wait for me there! We will have the opportunity to put our talents to good use and solve problems!" At the time, I didn't express any different opinions, and with the air of someone who was at least not a layman, I boarded the train.
　　When I arrived at the factory, there was naturally no factory at that time, only the newly repaired office building standing near the ruins of the Japanese bacterial factory; although there were not many people, it was quite crowded, both lively and chaotic. Civil engineering construction had not yet started, and production preparation was even more clueless, so there was no question of the technical problems of manufacturing cars. But what was frightening were the factory's production design documents, which were voluminous and alarmingly numerous; and, it was said, this was only a very small portion of what had just been sent from the Soviet Union!
　　Everyone was buried in drawings and documents. When opened, they were unrecognizable; when checked in the dictionary, the meaning was incomprehensible; even where the wording was clear, the technical aspects were understood only vaguely, and no conclusion could be drawn about what was going on. "Putting talents to good use and solving problems" turned into question marks. The facts educated me that although I was wearing an old brand, I had to re-enroll as a new student.
　　The comrades who participated in the construction of the factory came from all provinces and regions. Their ages and accents were different. At that time, I found that everyone had only one thing in common, and that was: no one knew how to build a large-scale automobile factory, and no one had really manufactured a car. Most of the comrades who transferred from other fields had not worked in industry, the comrades from the countryside had not even seen a factory, and the young men who had just graduated from school were only familiar with things in books. Were these the backbone for building a factory and manufacturing cars? Therefore, I thought that such three cobblers might find it difficult to make a Zhuge Liang!
　　Three years later, it is this group of people who, with the help of Soviet experts, finally enabled the "Liberation" brand cars to roll off the assembly line. I now understand: it turns out that everyone also has another thing in common, and that is: under the leadership of the Party, everyone has a burning heart to build the socialist industry of the motherland. This is the driving force for continuous learning and continuous work. This driving force has turned what seemed impossible into possible, into reality.
　　Truly Good Teachers
　　In the summer of 1953, Comrade Sigachov, the chief Soviet expert helping to build the factory, arrived in Changchun. During our first meeting, he enthusiastically handed me the information he brought from the Soviet Union on the organization of production technology preparation and working methods of automobile factories, and asked me and my comrades to study it. This gave us a lot of completely new knowledge in terms of work content, procedures, and division of labor.
　　However, working with Soviet experts for the first time, I was still a little unaccustomed. I found a lot of difficult problems in the materials, what should I do? Asking the experts for advice was somewhat hesitant. For example: was the question asked appropriately? Would it be embarrassing to raise questions that were too simple and trivial? Would the experts be willing to patiently explain in their busy schedule? What if the expert asked back, would I be stumped? After thinking about it this way and that, I came to the conclusion that it was better to ask less, and sometimes I would interpret and execute according to my own subjective ideas. Some inappropriate things were not corrected until the expert discovered them and gave timely guidance. This was a detour I took in learning from Soviet experts.
　　Later, the number of Soviet experts coming to the factory gradually increased, and at the same time, by studying various design documents and materials from the Soviet Union, I realized that the knowledge gained from the experts and designs was very specific, detailed, and able to solve practical problems and had a theoretical basis. Only then did I begin to clearly understand the great significance of the Party's call to learn from advanced Soviet experience.
　　The chief process engineer, Soviet expert Kachakov, arrived at the factory in October 1954. For two years, he has been my closest teacher. He taught me how to make plans, check work, study systems, and decide on technical measures. We attended meetings together, went to the workshop together, and listened to the opinions of our subordinate units together. He not only gave me guidance on technical and management work, but also influenced me in terms of work style and work attitude. He was not only unambiguous on matters of principle, but also grasped important specific issues very tightly. He not only put forward his own opinions, but also consulted my views. He not only helped me make decisions, but also supported and respected the decisions I made. Looking back, if it hadn't been for the help of the experts, we don't know which stage our work would still be groping in!
　　Many experts have returned to the Soviet Union one after another, but they still maintain contact with us, and often give us valuable teachings in correspondence. Many comrades who went to the Soviet Union for internships have returned to the factory one after another, and also maintain close teacher-student relationships with their internship instructors. Everyone's friendship has been growing with work and time.
　　Standing next to the machines and tools transported from the Soviet Union, studying the Soviet designs and drawings, and applying the technology and knowledge taught by the Soviet experts... I will always remember the teachings of the Soviet experts and the selfless friendship of the Soviet people. From here, I truly understand what is called internationalism.
　　I see clearly the power of the masses.
　　Starting in August last year, the basic production workshops of the whole factory successively entered into production adjustment. This was a complex, heavy, and precisely work that we had no experience in. Thinking of our past backwardness in technical level, I couldn't help but feel uneasy all day long. The leadership called on us to strive to produce cars this year, and at that time I felt that this was just a "struggle goal," as to whether it could be achieved, that remained to be seen.
　　However, after everyone's serious study, especially after the high tide of the advanced producer movement was set off, a large number of rationalization proposals emerged. Technicians enthusiastically helped the workers realize rationalization proposals from the design and calculation aspects, and the workers also gave the technicians help based on their own practical experience. Key issues were solved one after another; new records continued to appear. In July, we finally assembled the first batch of domestically produced cars ahead of schedule!
　　The birth of domestically produced cars has the power of the working masses, and also the power of intellectuals. Only when these two forces are combined is it the greatest force, and the results are the fastest. The aloofness and isolation of "intellectuals" in the past will not bring any major achievements. This is an extremely profound inspiration for intellectuals like me.
　　Looking at the entire construction process of the factory, three years is indeed not long. But the gains I have made in these three years have greatly exceeded what I have known and learned in the past thirty years. In these three years, I have not only opened my eyes and increased my knowledge on scientific and technical issues, but more importantly, I have received practical education in Marxism-Leninism from all aspects. The countless facts in the factory construction process have improved my understanding of the Party, strengthened my confidence in socialist construction, and encouraged my work enthusiasm and initiative.
　　I will unswervingly strive to build a strong industry for the motherland. (Attached pictures)

    胜过已往三十年
    第一汽车制造厂工艺处处长　吴敬业
       重新做学生
    1953年3月，我动身来长春之前，一位工程师向我说：“先去吧，到那儿等着我！咱们将有机会施展所长，解决问题了！”当时，我没有表示不同的意见，带着一付起码不是外行人的神气，上了火车。
    到厂一看，那时候自然还没有工厂，只有新修复不久的矗立在日军细菌工厂废墟附近的办公大楼；人虽然不多，可也够得上熙熙攘攘，既热闹又乱。土木建筑工程还没有开始，生产准备更茫无头绪，当然谈不上什么制造汽车的技术问题了。但是可怕的却是工厂的生产设计文件，成本成卷的，多得惊人；而且，据说这还仅仅是刚由苏联寄来的极少的一部分！
    大家都埋头在图纸文件里面。翻开来，不认识；查字典，弄不通语意；就是搞清楚了字句的地方，在技术方面也是似懂非懂，到底是怎么回事，老也下不了结论。“施展所长、解决问题”，变成了问号。事实教育了我，虽然挂着老牌子，还得再做新学生。
    参加建厂的同志来自各省各地。年龄、口音，各不相同。当时我发现大家只有一个共同之点，那就是：谁也不懂得怎样建设一座规模巨大的汽车厂，谁也没有真正制造过汽车。转业的同志大多没有搞过工业，农村来的同志甚至没有见过工厂，刚出学校的小伙子也只不过熟悉点书本子上的东西。难道这就是建设工厂，制造汽车的骨干吗？因此，我想，这样的三个臭皮匠，也许很难凑成一个诸葛亮吧！
    三年后的今天，就是这样的一伙人，在苏联专家的帮助下，终于使总装配线上开出了“解放”牌汽车。我现在懂得：原来大家还有另外一个共同之点，那就是：在党的领导下，人人都有一颗建设祖国社会主义工业的火热的心。这就是不断学习，不断工作的动力。这个动力，使看来不可能的事变成了可能，变成了现实。
    真正的好老师
    1953年夏天，帮助建厂的苏联总专家希格乔夫同志到了长春。在我们第一次见面的时候，他就热情地把他从苏联带来的有关汽车工厂生产技术准备组织和工作方法的资料交给我，要我和同志们研究。这在工作内容、程序、分工各方面给了我们不少的完全新颖的知识。
    但是，第一次和苏联专家在一起工作，自己还有些不习惯。从资料里发现了不少疑难问题，怎么办呢？请教专家，多少是有些顾虑的。例如：问题提得是不是恰当？过于简单琐碎的问题提出来，是否有失身分？专家肯不肯在百忙中耐心地给以解释？万一专家反问一下，会不会被考住？如此东一想，西一想，结果就认为还是少提为妙，有时就按照自己的主观想法来解释执行。有些做得不妥当的事，直到专家发现并及时加以指导后，才获得纠正。这是我在向苏联专家学习方面走的一段弯路。
    以后，来厂的苏联专家逐渐增加，同时由于学习了苏联设计的各种文件资料，体会到得自专家和设计中的学问，都是非常具体、细致，能够解决实际问题而又有理论根据的。我这才开始明确认识了党所号召的学习苏联先进经验的重大意义。
    总工艺师、苏联专家卡切可夫同志在1954年10月间到厂。两年以来，他一直是我最亲密的老师。他教我学会了如何布置计划，检查工作，研究制度，决定技术措施。我们一同召开会议，一同下车间，一同听取所属各单位的意见。他不但在技术和管理工作上给我指教，也在工作作风和工作态度方面给我影响。他不但在原则问题上不含糊，对重要的具体问题也抓得很紧。他不但提出自己的意见，而且也征询我的看法。他不但帮助我做出决定，
  同时也支持和尊重我所做的决定。回想起来，要不是专家们的帮助，我们的工作还不晓得在哪个阶段里摸索呢！
    许多位专家陆续返回苏联了，但是他们还仍旧同我们保持着联系，时常在通讯中给我们宝贵的教导。许多到苏联去实习的同志陆续回厂了，也同样和他们的实习导师们保持着密切的师生关系。大家的友谊，一直在随着工作和时间日益增长。
    站在苏联运来的机器工具旁边，研究学习着苏联的设计和图纸，运用着苏联专家传授来的技术和知识……随时都会想起苏联专家的教导和苏联人民无私的友情。从这里，我真正懂得了什么叫做国际主义。
  看清了群众的力量
    去年8月开始，全厂各基本生产车间相继投入生产调整。这是一件复杂、繁重而又恰恰是我们毫无经验的工作。想到我们过去技术水平的落后，不禁终日提心吊胆。领导上号召争取今年出车，我当时觉得，这不过是个“奋斗的目标”，至于究竟能否做到，那还要“走着瞧”。
    但是，经过大家认真地学习，特别是在先进生产者运动的高潮掀起以后，合理化建议大量涌来。技术人员都热情地从设计和计算方面帮助工人同志们实现合理化建议，工人同志们也根据自己的实践经验给技术人员以帮助。关键问题，依次解决；新的纪录，不断出现。7
  月间，我们终于提前装配出了第一批国产汽车！
    国产汽车的问世，有劳动群众的力量，也有知识分子的力量。只有这两种力量结合起来，才是最大的力量，成效也最快。过去“读书人”的清高孤傲，是不会带来什么重大成就的。这对像我这样的知识分子，是一个极其深刻的启发。
    从整个建厂过程来看，三年时间，的确不长。但是这三年来我所得到的收获，却大大超过了我以往三十多年的所知所学。这三年，我不仅在科学技术问题上开了眼界，增长了见识，更重要的是从各方面接受了马克思列宁主义的实际教育。建厂过程的无数事实，提高了我对党的认识，加强了我对社会主义建设的信心，鼓舞了我的工作积极性和主动性。
    我将坚持不渝地为建设祖国的强大的工业而努力。（附图片）
