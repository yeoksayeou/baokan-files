    Determining Subsidies for Commune Cadres Should Not Refer to the Strength of Their Own Labor
    Jiang Qicheng
    In his article "How to Calculate Subsidies for Agricultural Cooperative Cadres Reasonably," Comrade Jin Mingqiao proposed a method of calculation based on percentages: The number of workdays subsidized for a staff member is equal to the average number of workdays performed annually by each person of that equivalent labor grade, multiplied by the percentage of necessary work absences for the individual. In his article "Reasonable Stipulations for the Remuneration of Agricultural Cooperative Staff," Comrade Chang Qing cited the example of the Xijing'an Cooperative, which determined the amount of subsidies based on the size of each staff member's responsibility, the weight of the task, and with reference to labor strength. Such regulations would result in unequal pay for equal work. The director of the Xijing'an Cooperative, assessed as a full ten-labor unit, received a subsidy of 150 workdays, accounting for 60% of the annual workdays. However, if this director, like an accountant, had a base score of eight labor points, then he should only be subsidized 138 workdays, a reduction of 8% (i.e., twelve workdays).
    Regarding the point made by both of them that the subsidies for commune cadres should be determined based on the standard of equivalent labor, I believe the following two points are worth studying:
    1. Article 32 of the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Cooperatives stipulates: "Every work quota should be the quantity that a medium-strength laborer can achieve and the quality that should be attained in one day of active labor under the same conditions; it should not be too high or too low." After the work quotas and labor remuneration standards are determined, regardless of who it is, male or female, young or old, as long as they complete a certain quantity and quality of work according to the standards, they will be credited with the workdays they deserve according to the standards. This is the method of calculating workdays in agricultural cooperatives. Members who complete the quota are not credited with fewer workdays because their labor is weak. Commune cadres also participate in labor within the commune, it's just a different division of labor; why should their remuneration, in addition to the regulations on work quantity and quality, also refer to labor strength?
    2. Each contributing their best is one of the advantages of agricultural cooperatives. Some agricultural cooperative cadres, although their labor strength is not as strong as others, have high class consciousness and strong leadership ability, and many have done a good job. The practice of "referring to labor strength" and taking "roughly the same as the annual income of equivalent labor" as the standard when determining subsidies for commune cadres does not conform to the principle of "to each according to their work."
    I believe that the remuneration of commune cadres should be determined according to the size of the staff member's division of responsibility, the weight of the task, and the amount of work absence, using the number of workdays earned by a medium-strength laborer in the commune in a year as the standard. At the end of the year, based on work attitude and the size of achievements, the members' congress should evaluate, and those who do well should be rewarded, and those who are passive and slack should have their workdays appropriately reduced. It should not be restricted by the strength of their own labor.

### 确定社干部的补贴不应参照本人劳动力的强弱

    确定社干部的补贴不应参照本人劳动力的强弱
    蒋启成
    金明桥同志在“农业社干部的补贴怎样计算才合理”一文中，提出按百分数计算的办法是：某一工作人员补贴劳动日等于该等劳力每人平均全年所作的劳动日数，乘本人必要误工百分数。常青同志在“合理规定农业合作社工作人员的报酬”一文中所举的西静庵社是根据每个工作人员责任的大小，任务的轻重，并参照劳力强弱，确定补贴多少。这样的规定会造成同工不同酬的结果。西静庵社的主任为十分劳力，补贴一百五十个劳动日，占全年劳动日的60％。但如这个主任像会计那样是八分底分，那就只该补助一百三十八个劳动日，要少8％（即十二个劳动日）。
    从他们两人提出的社干部补贴应以同等劳动力为标准来确定这一点，我认为有如下两点值得研究。
    1、高级农业社示范章程三十二条规定：“每一种工作定额，都应该是中等劳动力在同等条件下积极劳动一天所能够做到的数量和应该达到的质量，不能偏高偏低”。工作定额和劳动报酬标准确定后，无论哪个人，不分男女老少，只要按照标准完成一定数量一定质量的工作，就给他按标准记下应得的劳动日。这是农业社计算劳动日的方法。社员完成了定额并不因劳力弱而少记劳动日。社干部同样参加社内劳动，只是分工上的不同；对他们的报酬，除了工作数量和质量规定外，为什么还要参照劳动力强弱呢？
    2、各尽其能是农业合作社的优越性之一。有的农业社干部，劳力虽不如他人强，但是阶级觉悟高，领导能力强，干好了工作的也不少。在确定社干部补贴时要“参照劳力强弱”以“同相等的劳力全年收入相差不多”为标准的做法是不符合“按劳取酬”原则的。
    我认为应根据工作人员分工责任的大小，任务轻重，误工多少，以社内中等劳动力一年所得的劳动日为标准，确定社干部的报酬。年终根据工作态度，成绩大小，由社员大会评议，好的予以奖励，消极怠工的适当扣减劳动日。不该受本人劳动力强弱的限制。
