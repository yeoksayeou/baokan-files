    New Victory for Anti-Colonialist Forces in Jordan
    Ding Hao De
    The Jordanian people have achieved another significant victory in their struggle to safeguard their national security and independence. On October 21, the Jordanian people successfully completed parliamentary elections, with parties advocating for strengthening Arab unity and opposing colonialism winning a majority of seats.
    After the resignation of former Jordanian Prime Minister Samir al-Rifai on May 20 of this year, al-Mufti succeeded him as Prime Minister. On June 21, he issued a statement in Parliament clearly stating that Jordan opposed participating in any form of foreign military bloc, which received enthusiastic support from the Jordanian people and public opinion. However, this statement was met with considerable opposition in Parliament, with some members even attempting to cast a vote of no confidence in the government. The Jordanian people widely believed that this parliament had been imposed by the former "Arab Legion" commander, British General Glubb, and did not represent the Jordanian people, who urgently demanded a general election. On June 26, the Jordanian government convened an emergency meeting to discuss Jordan's internal and external situation and recommended that the King dissolve Parliament. King Hussein accepted this recommendation and immediately ordered the dissolution of Parliament. This led to the parliamentary elections on October 21.
    During the four-month election preparation period in Jordan, British imperialism consistently showed great unease. It feared that anti-colonialist forces would win the Jordanian elections, weakening its dominant position in Jordan and thwarting its plans to drag Jordan into the Baghdad Pact. Therefore, during this period, Britain tried every means to sabotage the Jordanian elections. The most obvious fact was that, on the one hand, it supported Israeli attacks on Jordanian border strongholds, creating tension between the two countries; at the same time, it attempted to take the opportunity to send its own troops and the troops of Iraq, a member of the Baghdad Pact, into Jordan under the pretext of helping Jordan resist Israel, in order to control the elections. British Air Force planes even flew demonstration flights over Amman on the eve of the elections, attempting to intimidate the Jordanian people. However, the Jordanian people were not intimidated. They not only rejected the British and Iraqi requests to station troops in Jordan, but also conducted the elections as scheduled.
    Although the Jordanian elections were held under British efforts to obstruct them, they proceeded relatively smoothly due to the unity of the Jordanian people and their unanimous support for the elections. The Jordanian Parliament has a total of forty seats. According to Western news agencies, the results of the elections were as follows: The National Socialist Party, which supports cooperation with Egypt and favors Arab unity, won eleven seats; the Arab Constitutional Party won four seats; the right-wing religious party Muslim Brotherhood, which advocates for the establishment of an Islamic state, won four seats; the progressive National Front won three seats; the Arab Ba'ath Party, which advocates for the realization of Arab unity, won two seats; the Liberation Party, which advocates for Arab unity, won two seats; the Arab Palestinian Union Party won two seats; and independent individuals won twelve seats. It is clear that the candidates that Britain had hoped would be elected suffered a serious defeat in these elections.
    Comparing the results of these elections with the members of the previous parliament reveals significant differences. The right-wing Arab Constitutional Party has been greatly weakened in the new parliament, where it held twenty-five seats in the previous parliament. The National Socialist Party, which has consistently advocated for the abolition of the Anglo-Jordanian treaty and the strengthening of Arab unity, has been greatly strengthened and become the largest party in parliament. Of particular note is the fact that all Jordanian parties in this campaign put forward the demand for the abolition of the Anglo-Jordanian treaty, even the Arab Constitutional Party raised this slogan. This shows that anti-colonialist parties can form a majority in the new parliament, laying the foundation for strengthening Arab unity and abolishing the Anglo-Jordanian treaty in the future.
    The Jordanian people have waged an unyielding and heroic struggle to defend their national independence and state sovereignty and to break free from the oppression of British colonialists. After the Second World War, they forced Britain to agree to Jordan's independence. However, Britain still retained its traditional position of power in Jordan. British General Glubb served as the commander of the "Arab Legion," and in 1948, Britain forced Jordan to sign a twenty-year alliance treaty. After gaining independence, the Jordanian people continued to struggle for the complete liberation of their nation. They demanded the expulsion of the British occupiers and their agents. In February 1955, Western colonial powers organized the so-called Baghdad Pact group in the Middle East, attempting to drag Jordan into this military bloc. The Jordanian people immediately launched a wave of opposition to Britain and the Baghdad Pact, with mass demonstrations and marches occurring continuously throughout the country. In this struggle, the Jordanian people achieved a great victory, forcing the removal of British General Glubb from office. Glubb's dismissal was a heavy blow to Britain's conspiracy to drag Jordan into the Baghdad Pact and weakened British control over the Jordanian army, which was fully in line with the national interests of Jordan, the national interests of all Arab countries, and the interests of peace in the entire Middle East region.
    The results of the new Jordanian parliamentary elections show that the will of the Jordanian people to oppose colonialism and strengthen unity among Arab countries to defend their national independence and sovereignty cannot be suppressed by any international reactionary force. The victory of the Jordanian people's will in the elections is another great victory for the Jordanian people since the expulsion of British General Glubb. It is clear that the establishment of the new Jordanian parliament has also strengthened unity within Jordan. In the new situation of national unity, the Jordanian people will surely achieve greater victories in the struggle to defend their national independence and sovereignty.

    约旦反殖民主义力量的新胜利
    丁好德
    约旦人民在维护自己国家民族的安全和独立的斗争中，又获得了新的重大胜利。10月21日，约旦人民顺利地完成了议会选举，主张加强阿拉伯国家团结和反对殖民主义的党派获得了多数的席位。
    今年5月20日，约旦前首相萨米尔·艾尔—里法伊辞职以后，艾尔—穆弗蒂继任首相。他6月21日在议会发表声明，明确指出约旦反对参加任何形式的外国军事集团，得到约旦人民和舆论的热烈支持；但他这个声明却在议会里遭到很大反对，有些议员并企图对政府投不信任票。约旦人民普遍认为，这个议会是前“阿拉伯军团”司令、英国格拉布将军强加的，并不能代表约旦人民，他们迫切要求举行大选。6月26日，约旦政府召开了紧急会议，讨论约旦的内外局势，建议国王解散议会。国王侯赛尼接受了这个建议，并立即下令解散了议会。这就导致了10月21日的议会选举。
    在约旦四个月的筹备选举期间，英帝国主义始终表现极大的不安。它害怕反殖民主义力量在约旦选举中获得胜利，削弱它在约旦的统治地位，并使它企图把约旦拉入巴格达条约的计划落空。因此，在这段期间，英国总在千方百计地企图破坏约旦的这次选举。最明显的事实是，它一方面支持以色列袭击约旦边境内据点，制造两国间的紧张局势；同时，它以帮助约旦抵抗以色列为名，企图乘机派遣自己的军队和巴格达条约国家伊拉克的部队进驻约旦，以控制这次选举。英国空军飞机还在选举前夕，就在安曼上空飞行示威，企图吓唬约旦人民。但是，约旦人民没有被吓倒，不但拒绝了英国和伊拉克驻兵约旦的要求，而且如期进行了选举。
    这次约旦的选举，虽然是在英国力图阻挠的情况下举行，但是由于约旦人民的团结，一致支持选举，因此进行得相当顺利。约旦议会共有四十个席位。选举结果，据西方通讯社报道，支持和埃及合作、赞成阿拉伯团结的国家社会党获得十一席，阿拉伯制宪党获得四席，赞成建立一个伊斯兰国家的右翼宗教党派穆斯林兄弟会获得四席，进步的全国阵线获得三席，赞成实现阿拉伯团结的阿拉伯复兴党获得两席，主张阿拉伯国家团结的解放党获得两席，阿拉伯巴勒斯坦联合党获得两席，独立人士获得十二席。很明显，英国所希望当选的候选人，在这次选举中遭到了严重失败。
    拿这次选举结果同上届议会的成员比较，有着显著的不同。右翼的阿拉伯制宪党在新议会中大大削弱了，而在上届议会中它拥有二十五个席位；一贯主张废除英—约（旦）条约和加强阿拉伯团结的国家社会党则有了很大的加强，成为议会中最大的一个政党。特别值得注意的事实是，约旦各党派在这次竞选中，都提出了废除英—约（旦）条约的要求，就连阿拉伯制宪党也提出了这个口号。这说明了反殖民主义的党派可以在新议会中结成多数，为今后加强阿拉伯国家的团结，取消英—约（旦）条约打下了基础。
    约旦人民为了保卫自己民族独立和国家主权，摆脱英国殖民主义者的压迫，曾经进行了不屈不挠的英勇斗争。在第二次大战后，迫使英国不能不同意约旦的独立。但是，英国仍然在约旦保有传统的势力地位。英国格拉布将军担任了“阿拉伯军团”司令的职务，1948年英国强迫约旦签订了二十年同盟条约。约旦人民在获得独立以后，继续为争取民族的彻底解放而进行着斗争。他们要求驱逐英国占领者及其代理人。1955年2月，西方殖民国家在中东组织所谓巴格达条约集团，企图把约旦拉进这个军事集团，约旦人民立即掀起了一个反对英国和反对巴格达条约的热潮，全国各地连续发生了群众性的示威游行。在这次斗争中，约旦人民取得了极大的胜利，迫使英国格拉布将军去职。格拉布的被解除职务，沉重地打击了英国想把约旦拉入巴格达条约的阴谋，削弱了英国对约旦军队的控制，这是完全符合约旦的民族利益、符合所有阿拉伯国家的民族利益和整个中东地区和平的利益的。
    约旦新议会选举的结果，表明约旦人民反对殖民主义和加强阿拉伯国家之间的团结以保卫自己民族独立主权的意志，是任何国际反动势力所压制不了的。约旦人民意志在选举中的胜利，是约旦人民继驱逐英国格拉布将军以来的又一次大胜利。很明显，约旦新议会的产生，也加强约旦内部的团结，约旦人民在举国上下团结一致的新情况下，在保卫自己民族独立和主权的斗争中，必将取得更大的胜利。
