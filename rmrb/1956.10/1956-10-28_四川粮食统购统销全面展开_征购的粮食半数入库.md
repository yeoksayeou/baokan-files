Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, October 26th: Sichuan Province has fully launched its unified purchase and sale of grain. In counties with faster progress, such as some counties in the Jiangjin Special District, Suining Special District, and Nanchong Special District, the grain purchase work has been basically completed. According to statistics from the Provincial Grain Bureau up to mid-October, half of the province's grain purchase task has already been put into storage.

	The unified purchase and sale of grain in Sichuan Province this year started in September. When carrying out this work, all localities used last year's grain "Three Fixes" data as a basis, and according to the state's unified purchase and sale policy, conducted preliminary trial calculations in advance, and then discussed by the masses to determine the annual purchase, sale, and marketing figures. The purchase situation shows that this approach not only ensures that the task distribution is reasonable, but also ensures the farmers' due grain retention level. According to a survey of more than 4,000 agricultural cooperatives in six counties including Jiangbei, after completing the unified purchase task, 96% of the cooperatives still had grain retention exceeding the state-stipulated figures.

    四川粮食统购统销全面展开
    征购的粮食半数入库
    据新华社成都26日电　四川省粮食统购统销工作已经全面展开。进展较快的县份，如江津专区、遂宁专区和南充专区的部分县，粮食征购工作已经基本结束。据省粮食厅到10月中旬的统计，占全省征购任务一半的粮食已经入库。
    四川省今年粮食统购统销工作是在9月份开始的。各地在进行这一工作时，都以去年粮食“三定”资料作基础，根据国家粮食统购统销政策，事先进行初步试算，然后由群众讨论，确定全年的征、购、销数字。征购情况表明：这样做既保证了任务分配得合理，也保证了农民应有的留粮水平。据江北等六个县四千多个农业社的调查，完成统购任务以后，有96％的社的留粮量仍超过了国家规定的数字。
