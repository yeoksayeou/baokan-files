Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: The first meeting of the Scientific and Technological Exchange Conference on the New Construction and Reconstruction of Irrigation Systems, convened according to the decision of the Sino-Soviet Technical Cooperation Conference, opened on the 15th and closed today after nine days.

Participating in this conference was the Soviet water conservancy delegation headed by Askochensky, Deputy Minister of Agriculture of the Soviet Union. On the Chinese side, there were more than 200 representatives from the Ministry of Water Conservancy and various water conservancy agencies across the country, as well as experts in electricity, agriculture, and other fields, including Minister of Water Conservancy, Fu Zuoyi.

During the preparation of the conference, the Ministry of Water Conservancy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam expressed great interest in exchanging experiences in the construction and reconstruction of irrigation systems. Therefore, at the invitation of the Chinese government, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also sent a delegation headed by Tran Dang Khoa, Minister of Water Conservancy and Construction, to participate in the conference.

At this conference, the Soviet water conservancy delegation, the water conservancy delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Chinese water conservancy workers participating in the conference made a total of twenty-three reports to the conference, providing more than nine hundred charts and diagrams. These reports and charts and diagrams were all to illustrate the situation of irrigation undertakings and the construction and reconstruction of irrigation systems, as well as the design and construction of water conservancy projects in China, the Soviet Union, and Vietnam. Among them, the Soviet delegation made four important reports: "Mechanization of Earthwork and Concrete Work in Soviet Hydraulic Structures," "New Construction and Reconstruction of Irrigation Systems in Rice and Cotton Growing Areas," "Reconstruction of Irrigation Canals," and "Standard Design of Rural Hydropower Stations." It also introduced the specific experiences of the Soviet Union in the standardized design of water conservancy soil improvement projects, the standardized mechanical equipment in hydraulic structures on irrigation canals, and planned water use. Among the reports made by the Chinese delegation to the conference were "New Construction and Reconstruction of Irrigation Networks in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region," "Irrigation and Drainage Measures in the Pearl River Delta," "Experience in Water Use in the Jing, Luo, and Wei Canals in Shaanxi," "Experience in Irrigation Using Groundwater (Well Irrigation) in Henan," and "Experimental Research on the Sand Carrying Capacity of the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation System." The conference conducted detailed discussions and studies on these reports and charts and diagrams. The Chinese water conservancy workers deeply felt that the experience provided by the Soviet Union would be of great help to China's future work in the new construction and reconstruction of irrigation systems. Chinese water conservancy workers also believed that the experience introduced by the Vietnamese delegation was also very valuable.

During the conference, at the invitation of Chinese water conservancy workers, experts from the Soviet delegation also held discussions on the planning and design of irrigation areas such as the Baisha Irrigation Area and the Qingtongxia Irrigation Area in China, and on how to select dam types under the current conditions in China, and put forward many beneficial opinions.

The closing ceremony was held at 4:00 p.m. today. The heads of the delegations from the Soviet Union and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Fu Zuoyi, Minister of Water Conservancy of China, all spoke successively. In their speeches, they all expressed satisfaction with the great achievements made at this conference and hoped that there would be frequent opportunities to hold such conferences in the future to exchange experiences in the construction and reconstruction of irrigation systems.

In the evening, Fu Zuoyi also held a banquet to entertain the delegations from the Soviet Union and Vietnam and the representatives from China who participated in the conference.

    灌溉系统科学技术交流会闭幕
    苏、越、中三国水利代表团交流了各方面的经验
    据新华社24日讯　根据中、苏技术合作会议决定召开的灌溉系统新建改建科学技术交流会议第一次会议于15日开幕，历时九天，已在今天闭幕。
    参加这次会议的有以苏联农业部副部长阿斯科琴斯基为首的苏联水利代表团。中国方面参加会议的有水利部部长傅作义和全国各水利机关的代表以及电力、农业等方面的专家共二百余人。
    在会议筹备期间，越南民主共和国水利部对交流灌溉系统新建、改建方面的经验很感兴趣。因此，经中国政府邀请，越南民主共和国也派了以水利和建筑部部长陈登科为首的代表团参加此次会议。
    在这个会议上，苏联水利代表团、越南民主共和国水利代表团和参加会议的中国水利工作者共向会议作了二十三个报告，提供了九百多种图表。这些报告和图表都是属于说明中、苏、越三国灌溉事业情况和灌溉系统新建、改建以及水利工程设计施工等方面的情况和经验。其中，苏联代表团作了“苏联水工建筑物中的土工和混凝土工的机械化”、“水稻、植棉地区灌溉系统新建和改建”“灌溉渠道的改建”以及“农村水电站的定型设计”四个重要报告，还介绍了苏联水利土壤改良工程的定型设计、灌溉渠道上的水工建筑物中的定型机械装置和计划用水等方面的具体经验。中国代表团向会议所作的报告中，有“新疆维吾尔自治区灌溉网的新建和改建”“珠江三角洲灌溉和排水措施”“陕西泾洛渭渠用水经验”“河南利用地下水灌溉（井灌）的经验”和“引黄灌溉系统挟沙能力测验研究”等。会议对这些报告和图表都分别进行了详尽的讨论和研究。中国的水利工作者深深感到，苏联所提供的经验将对中国今后灌溉系统新建改建等工作有极大帮助。中国的水利工作者还认为，越南代表团所介绍的经验也是很可贵的。
    在会议期间，苏联代表团的专家们，还应中国的水利工作者的邀请，就中国白沙灌区、青铜峡等灌区的规划设计问题和在中国目前条件下应如何选择坝型等问题举行了座谈，并且提出了许多有益的意见。
    闭幕式在今天下午四时举行，苏联、越南民主共和国的代表团长和中国水利部部长傅作义，都先后讲了话。他们讲话中都对这次会议所获得的巨大成果表示满意，并且希望今后经常有机会召开这种会议来交流灌溉系统新建、改建工作方面的经验。
    晚间，傅作义还举行了宴会，招待苏、越两国代表团和中国方面参加会议的代表。
