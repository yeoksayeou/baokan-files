A wise man accesses all knowledge, but understands the world by mastering one thing; a fool, even if he accesses various knowledge, shines no brighter than a star.

* Two wise men consulting together will produce even better ideas; mixing yellow and red colors will create another color.
* Even if you have majesty and grandeur, without learning it is all for show; even if you have property and money, without good fortune it will not last.

* You don't need to say much to a wise man, you can tell from their attitude and expression; you don't need to taste a Nepalese pomegranate, you can tell what it is like by looking at the skin.

### 西藏萨迦格言

    西藏萨迦格言聪明人他接触所有的知识，但他是以精通一种来认识世界；傻瓜那怕接触了各种知识，也是像星星一样发不出大的光芒。
                  ＊两个聪明人在一起商量，就会生出更好的主张；黄的和红的两种颜色混合，就会变出另外一种色彩。＊那怕你有威严，有排场，没有学问也是空好看；那怕你有财产、有金钱，没有福分也是呆不常。
                    ＊对聪明人不用多讲，从态度、表情上就可知道；尼泊尔的石榴不用尝，看看外皮就可以晓得怎样。
            王尧选译
