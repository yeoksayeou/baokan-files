Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 29th: Pakistan Islamic Republic Prime Minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy gave a speech at Guangzhou Railway Station today before leaving Guangzhou. The full text of the speech is as follows:

Friends:

I am about to leave China and return to Pakistan. Therefore, it is fitting that I now, on behalf of myself and all members of my delegation, individually and collectively express how grateful we are for your warm hospitality. The hospitality and friendliness of the Chinese people are renowned throughout the world, but the hospitality we have received is truly touching. Wherever we went, we were greeted with exhilarating welcomes. We are deeply moved and deeply grateful.

I regret that I cannot stay longer and see more of your remarkable country. What I have seen is moving, interesting, and also very educational. It is truly inspiring to see men and women, young and old, dedicating all their energy and attention to the construction of New China. The achievements made in such a short time in all fields – in industry, agriculture, education, science, civil engineering, arts and crafts, medicine, and health – are enormous and astonishing. This is only the beginning. I see great potential and a great future for China. All this is due to the Chinese people and their great leaders, because they have shown selfless dedication and determination in the great task of building a great country. I can only admire them. In addition to visiting so many interesting places and various organizations, and becoming familiar with and understanding so many things about New China (before coming here I had only read and heard about New China), I also had the honor of meeting Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, and their outstanding colleagues. This was a remarkable experience. Their character and attitude attracted and moved me. I had several discussions and conversations with them. In the process of freely and friendly exchanging opinions, we discussed matters of world concern and matters of common interest to China and Pakistan. Among the many issues we discussed were world peace, international cooperation, and the easing of world tensions. I believe that these talks, conducted in such a friendly and sincere atmosphere, greatly contributed to a better understanding of our common problems and helped to strengthen the relationship between our two countries. If we have more such contacts, we will be able to develop even closer relations, better understanding, and more cooperation between China and Pakistan. I look forward to your great Premier Zhou Enlai and his distinguished colleagues visiting Pakistan. At that time, we will have another opportunity to hold fruitful talks on issues of common concern.

Finally, I would like to once again express my deepest gratitude to the Chinese government, the Chinese people, and their distinguished leaders for their very warm hospitality, and to extend our greetings and sincere wishes to them all and to the hundreds of millions of people in China, wishing them progress, happiness, and prosperity. May the bonds of friendship between China and Pakistan be continuously strengthened.

Long live China!

    苏拉瓦底总理的讲话
    新华社广州29日电　巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国总理侯赛恩·沙希德·苏拉瓦底今天离开广州前，在广州车站讲了话。讲话全文如下：朋友们：
    我就要离开中国回巴基斯坦了。因此，现在我来以我自己的名义和我的代表团的全体人员的名义个别地和集体地表示我们对于你们的盛情招待是多么感激，是恰当的。中国人的殷勤好客和亲切待人是四海闻名的，但是我们所受到的殷勤招待是令人感动的。不论我们到那里，我们都受到令人振奋的欢迎。我们深受感动，也深为感激。
    我不能够再多呆一些时候，再多看看你们这个了不起的国家，我感到很遗憾。我所见到的东西是令人感动的，有趣的，也是颇有教益的。男女老少都以全副精力和全部注意力投入新中国的建设工作，看到这种情景真是令人神往。在这样短的时间里在一切活动方面——在工业、农业、教育、科学、土木建筑、艺术和工艺、医药、卫生健康事业等方面所取得的成绩，是巨大的，惊人的。这只是开始。我看到中国有极大的潜力和伟大的前途。所有这一切都要归功于中国人民和他们伟大的领袖们，因为他们在建设一个伟大国家的巨大任务中表现了忘我的献身精神和决心。我对他们只有感到钦佩。除了参观了这么许多有趣的地方和各种组织，熟悉和了解了新中国的这么许多事情以外（我在到这里来以前只是读到和听到过一些新中国的情况），我还很荣幸地会见了毛泽东主席、周恩来总理和他们的杰出的同事们。这是一个很了不起的经历。他们的品格和态度吸引了我，感动了我。我同他们进行了几次讨论和谈话。我们在自由和友好地交换意见的过程中讨论了世界所关心的事情和对中巴两国有共同利害关系的事情。我们讨论的许多问题当中包括世界和平的问题，国际合作的问题和缓和世界紧张局势的问题。我相信，在这样友好和诚挚的气氛中进行的这些会谈大大有助于对我们共同的问题的更好的了解，有助于加强我们两国之间的关系。如果我们进行更多这样的接触，我们将能在中巴两国之间发展甚至更加密切的关系，更好的了解和更多的合作。我期待着你们伟大的总理周恩来和他的杰出的同事们到巴基斯坦来访问。那时候，我们将又有机会进一步就共同关心的问题进行有益的会谈。
    最后，我愿意再一次对中国政府、中国人民和他们杰出的领袖们的非常殷勤的招待表示最深切的谢意，并且向他们大家和向全中国亿万人民表达我们的问候和诚恳的祝愿，祝他们进步、幸福和繁荣。祝中巴两国之间的友谊联系不断地加强。
    中国万岁！
