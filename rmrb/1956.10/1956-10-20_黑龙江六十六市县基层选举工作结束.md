Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 18th -- By early October, sixty of the sixty-six cities and counties in Heilongjiang Province had completed their grassroots election work. Hailun, Mishan, Luobei, and two other counties held their Second County People's Congresses successively before the end of September and elected new County People's Committees.

According to statistics from Shuangyashan, Yanshou, Qing'an, and two other counties and cities, the number of voters participating in the elections accounted for more than 93% of the total number of voters.

In this grassroots election, most areas paid attention to promoting democracy, and voters carefully selected representatives who would work for the people. However, the election work in some places was carried out relatively crudely. The cities and counties that have completed the grassroots elections are preparing to organize inspection teams to conduct a review of this grassroots election work.
