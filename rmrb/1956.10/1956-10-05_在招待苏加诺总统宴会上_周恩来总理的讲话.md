Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Banquet in Honor of President Sukarno

Your Excellency President Sukarno, Distinguished Guests from Indonesia, Friends, Comrades:

    At the invitation of our country and Chairman Mao, His Excellency President Sukarno has come to our country for a friendly visit. During his stay in Beijing, President Sukarno participated in our National Day celebrations, attended mass rallies in Beijing, attended an enlarged joint meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and delivered an important speech, held cordial and sincere talks with our leaders, had extensive and friendly contacts with people from all walks of life in Beijing, and visited schools and scenic spots. Now, President Sukarno is about to leave our capital, Beijing, to visit other parts of our country.

    Your Excellency President, your visit and the moving speeches you delivered in Beijing will forever remain in the memory of the people of Beijing and the entire Chinese people. The Chinese people have long known about President Sukarno's heroic struggle against colonial rule, despite various persecutions. The Chinese people are also familiar with President Sukarno's outstanding contributions to winning national independence, safeguarding national unity, strengthening cooperation among Asian and African countries, and defending world peace. What the Chinese people particularly admire is that President Sukarno has relied on the Indonesian people for many years and fought for their interests. Our people feel infinitely honored to be able to receive such an outstanding statesman from our friendly neighbor.

    The people of China and Indonesia have a long-standing and sincere friendship. After the Asian-African Conference, I was invited to visit Indonesia. President Sukarno's kind concern for me and our delegation, and the Indonesian government and people's warm hospitality and enthusiastic welcome, made us personally experience the depth of this friendship. The enthusiastic, brave, and wise Indonesian people, and the beautiful and rich archipelago, left us with an extremely deep impression, so that we still miss Indonesia and will always miss Indonesia.

    The friendship between our two peoples has grown up in the common struggle to safeguard world peace and oppose colonialism, and will continue to move forward hand in hand for this common goal in the future. Since we can understand each other and sympathize with each other, we should support each other and help each other without any conditions attached. We should learn from each other and be friends forever, like our own relatives, like our own brothers. The growing development of friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries will greatly strengthen the forces of the people in the Asian and African regions in their struggle for peace, independence, and freedom.

    Your Excellency President, China is a country that has just begun construction and is still very backward in many respects. I sincerely hope that you and other Indonesian guests will frankly offer criticisms and suggestions on the errors and shortcomings in our work in all aspects during your visit to our country and after your visit.

    As you are about to leave our capital, please allow me, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, to express our deep gratitude for your friendly visit, and to ask Your Excellency to convey the brotherly friendship of the 600 million Chinese people to all the Indonesian people.

    I propose a toast:

    To the growing development of the eternal, brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples,

    To the unity of the peoples of Asia,

    To world peace,

    To the health of His Excellency President Sukarno and all the distinguished Indonesian guests!

    在招待苏加诺总统宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话尊敬的总统阁下，印度尼西亚的贵宾们，朋友们，同志们：
    苏加诺总统阁下应我们国家和毛主席的邀请来我国进行友好访问。苏加诺总统在北京逗留的期间，参加了我国的国庆典礼，出席了北京市的群众大会，和全国人民代表大会常务委员会和中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会扩大的联席会议并且发表了重要的演说，同我国领导人员进行了亲切和诚恳的会谈，同北京各界人民进行了广泛和友好的接触，并且参观了学校，游览了名胜古迹。现在，苏加诺总统就要离开我国首都北京，到我国其他各地去参观访问。
    总统阁下，你的访问和你在北京期间所发表的动人的演说将永远留在北京市人民和全中国人民的记忆里。中国人民很早就知道苏加诺总统不顾种种迫害，同殖民统治进行英勇斗争的事迹。中国人民也很熟悉苏加诺总统为了争取国家独立、维护民族团结、加强亚非各国的合作和保卫世界和平所作的卓越贡献。中国人民特别钦佩的是，苏加诺总统多年来依靠印度尼西亚人民，并且为印度尼西亚人民的利益而斗争。我国人民能够接待我们友好邻邦的这样一位杰出的政治家，感到无限的光荣。
    中国人民和印度尼西亚人民有着悠久的真挚的友谊。亚非会议以后，我曾经应邀访问了印度尼西亚。苏加诺总统对我和我国代表团的亲切关怀，印度尼西亚政府和人民对我们的盛情款待和热烈欢迎，使我们亲身体验到这种友谊的深厚。热情、勇敢和智慧的印度尼西亚人民，和美丽富饶的千岛之国，给我们留下了极为深刻的印象，使我们至今还怀念着印度尼西亚，而且将永远怀念着印度尼西亚。
    我们两国人民的友谊是在维护世界和平和反对殖民主义的共同斗争中成长起来的，今后也将为着这一共同目标而携手前进。我们既然能够互相了解，互相同情，我们就应该互相支援，互相帮助，而不要附带任何条件。我们应该互相学习，永远友好，像自己的亲人一样，像自己的兄弟一样。我们两国友好合作关系的日益发展将大大地加强亚非地区人民争取和平、独立和自由的力量。
    尊敬的总统阁下，中国是一个刚刚开始建设，在许多方面还是非常落后的国家。我诚恳地希望你和其他印度尼西亚贵宾们在我国参观访问中和在访问以后，对我们各方面工作中的错误和缺点不客气地提出批评和指教。
    当你即将离开我国首都的时候，请允许我代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民对阁下的友好访问表示深切的谢意，并且请求阁下把六万万中国人民兄弟般的友谊转达给全体印度尼西亚人民。
    我提议：
    为中国和印度尼西亚两国人民之间的永恒的、兄弟般的友谊的日益发展，
    为亚洲各国人民的团结，
    为世界和平，
    为苏加诺总统阁下和全体印度尼西亚贵宾们的健康干杯！
