　　Since the Soviet-Japanese Negotiations
　　Li Chunqing
　　Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama has already departed to visit the Soviet Union in order to resume Soviet-Japanese negotiations. In any case, this is welcome news. A year ago, West German Chancellor Adenauer visited the Soviet Union and restored diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Adenauer could do that, and Hatoyama can certainly do that too. The war ended eleven years ago, and normal relations have not yet been restored between the Soviet Union and Japan. This is both unreasonable and unrealistic. If Hatoyama can negotiate with the spirit of independent diplomacy, the negotiations have a chance of success.

　　Three Negotiations
　　The Soviet-Japanese negotiations have been delayed for more than a year. This visit by Hatoyama is the fourth round of negotiations. The negotiations initially took place in London, from June 3rd of last year to March 20th of this year, with twenty-three meetings held. The Soviet Union was very active, and at the third meeting, Malik proposed a draft of the Soviet-Japanese peace treaty. However, Japan was not active, deliberately creating obstacles on the issue of "detained personnel" (Japanese war criminals), repeatedly delaying the conclusion of an agreement. On September 21st of last year, Khrushchev said the following to the visiting Japanese Diet members: "We have the impression that the Japanese side is not particularly interested in the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, and is therefore deliberately delaying the negotiations." However, in the end, the London negotiations reached ten agreements on the signing of a peace treaty, and almost all issues were settled except for the territorial issue. If the Japanese government was willing to make further efforts and not recall its representative, Shunichi Matsumoto, the London negotiations would not have fallen short.

　　After the failure of the London negotiations, Japan attempted to resolve the North Pacific fisheries issue independently without diplomatic relations. In late April of this year, Japanese Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Ichiro Kono went to Moscow, which was the second round of negotiations. On May 14th, the two countries signed the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Treaty and the Maritime Rescue Agreement.

　　Because both agreements stipulated that they would take effect from the date of the peace treaty or the resumption of Soviet-Japanese diplomatic relations, and the Soviet-Japanese Joint Communiqué stipulated that negotiations for the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations would resume no later than July 31st, the interrupted London negotiations were able to reopen. Japan sent Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu as its plenipotentiary representative to Moscow, which was the third round of negotiations. These negotiations lasted from July 31st to August 13th. Shepilov and Shigemitsu engaged in frank and intense debates, and Shigemitsu also met with Bulganin once. As a result, Shigemitsu, who had always advocated a "cautious attitude" toward negotiations with the Soviet Union, also believed that the peace treaty could be signed. However, because the Japanese government's internal opinions were inconsistent and there was a great deal of infighting, it hastily decided to order Shigemitsu to go to London to attend the conference on the Suez Canal issue, refusing to sign the Soviet-Japanese peace treaty. Their excuse was still the territorial issue. This time, Shigemitsu told the truth, saying that the reason the peace treaty could not be signed was not a matter of "conditions" of the treaty, but a "political issue."

　　After Shigemitsu refused to sign, Hatoyama expressed his willingness to visit the Soviet Union personally on August 19th to break the deadlock in the negotiations. On September 3rd, Shigemitsu returned to Tokyo via the United States. From that day on, Hatoyama convened a series of meetings to adjust and unify internal opinions. On September 7th, Hatoyama proposed a new plan, the so-called "Hatoyama method," which called for making five demands of the Soviet Union while temporarily shelving the territorial issue: (1) declare the end of the state of war and restore diplomatic relations; (2) exchange ambassadors; (3) immediately repatriate "detained personnel"; (4) confirm the entry into force of the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Treaty; (5) the Soviet Union unconditionally supports Japan's accession to the United Nations. With the exception of Shigemitsu, who still advocated signing a peace treaty, the cabinet basically agreed to Hatoyama's new plan. Regarding Shigemitsu, Hatoyama said: "My opinion differs fundamentally from that of the Foreign Minister, and the Foreign Minister must resign." Because Hatoyama's attitude was firm, the opposing opinions subsided. Suddenly, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Allison publicly intervened, and on September 10th he made two suggestions to the Japanese government: first, be cautious of the Soviet Union's actions; second, the Japanese-Soviet negotiations should take more time. This meant: Don't do it, Hatoyama! Some members of the Liberal Democratic Party responded to the U.S. interference, stirring up trouble everywhere. Hatoyama had to delay his trip. Until recently, it was said that based on a telegram from Matsumoto Shunichi from Moscow, the Japanese cabinet formally approved Hatoyama's visit to the Soviet Union on October 2nd.

　　Three Problems
　　Because the Soviet-Japanese negotiations have been going on for more than a year, and Hatoyama's visit to the Soviet Union constitutes the fourth round of negotiations, the conditions are relatively mature. In the past, there were three troublesome issues. These were: the so-called return of "detained personnel"; maintaining fishing rights; and demanding the territory of the Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin. The Japanese right-wing forces called these three issues the "three principles" for negotiations with the Soviet Union.

　　At the beginning of the London negotiations, the Japanese representatives raised the issue of first releasing "detained personnel," insisting that there were more than 10,000 Japanese in the Soviet Union, and saying that the release was a "humanitarian issue" unrelated to the peace treaty, thereby refusing to discuss the draft peace treaty. In fact, there were no detained Japanese civilians in the Soviet Union, only more than 1,000 Japanese war criminals who had already been sentenced and were serving their sentences. Japanese war criminals are serving sentences in foreign countries; there are more than 200 in the United States, 149 in Australia, 131 in the Netherlands, and 80 in the United Kingdom... These countries signed a "peace treaty" with Japan in September 1951, and Japan did not raise "humanitarian issues" with them, nor did it demand that they release Japanese war criminals. The state of war between the Soviet Union and Japan has not yet ended, and Japan is demanding that Japanese war criminals serving sentences in the Soviet Union be released first. This is unreasonable. Nevertheless, the Soviet government has successively released several batches of Japanese war criminals who could be released since July of last year. This issue is not unsolvable. If the restoration of Soviet-Japanese diplomatic relations can make it easier for Japanese war criminals to return home, then delaying the negotiations means that the Japanese government does not want the war criminals to return home.

　　Regarding the North Pacific fisheries issue, it used to be a privilege of Japanese imperialism. Because Japan defeated Tsarist Russia, the Treaty of Portsmouth recognized Japan's right to fish in Russian territorial waters. Before the war, this issue was always a tool for Japan's anti-Sovietism. On March 21st of this year, the Soviet government announced that it would restrict the amount of fishing in the North Pacific fishing grounds during the spawning period of salmon and trout—from May 15th to September 15th—to 25 million fish. This was to protect fish resources. Japan has been overfishing in the North Pacific. Last year, it caught 64 million fish, and this year it plans to exceed 100 million. Nevertheless, during the negotiations between Ishkov and Ichiro Kono in May of this year, the Soviet government still took into account the needs of Japanese fishermen, and the temporary agreement for this year relaxed the amount of fishing to 65,000 tons, or about 32.5 million fish. If the restoration of Soviet-Japanese diplomatic relations is more convenient for the Japanese North Pacific fisheries, then delaying the negotiations means that the Japanese government does not value the interests of Japanese fishermen. This is also a clear truth.

　　The last issue is the territorial issue. According to the international agreements during World War II, that is, according to the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Proclamation, which was based on these two agreements and presented to and accepted by Japan, there is no territorial issue between the Soviet Union and Japan. If we act in accordance with international agreements, the territorial issue between the Soviet Union and Japan has already been resolved. That is:

　　According to Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Yalta Agreement: "Southern Sakhalin and all adjacent islands shall be returned to the Soviet Union." Article 3 stipulates: "The Kuril Islands shall be handed over to the Soviet Union."

　　This provision is very clear. It is precisely because Japan recognized the Yalta Agreement, and the United States also recognized this agreement, that Article 2, Paragraph 3 of the "San Francisco Treaty of Peace with Japan" signed in September 1951 stipulates: "Japan renounces all right, title and claim to the Kuril Islands, and to that portion of Sakhalin and the islands adjacent to it over which Japan acquired sovereignty as a consequence of the Treaty of Portsmouth of 5 September 1905." At that time, the Japanese government did not demand the Kuril Islands, nor did it demand the southern part of the Kuril Islands. In law, Japan has already renounced the Kuril Islands. The Kuril Islands, of course, include the southern part of the Kuril Islands. However, now Japan is demanding that the Soviet Union relinquish sovereignty over the islands of Shikotan and Habomai, and is also demanding that the Soviet Union relinquish the islands of Kunashiri and Iturup, that is, the southern Kuril Islands.

　　In fact, after Japan's surrender, the above four islands have been under the administration of the Soviet government, and more than 20,000 Japanese residents on the islands have been evacuated back to their country.

　　On September 21st of last year, Khrushchev told the visiting Japanese Diet members that the issue of the Habomai and Shikotan Islands had originally been resolved by international agreement, but the Soviet Union could consider making the resolution of these two islands favorable to Japan. In the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, the Soviet Union has agreed that the above two islands can be transferred to Japan on the premise of signing a peace treaty. However, Japan does not agree; it also wants Kunashiri and Iturup Islands, that is, the Southern Kuril Islands.

　　According to Article 8 of the Potsdam Proclamation: "Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine." The "other minor islands" referred to in this article that have not been decided, such as the Ogasawara Islands and the Volcano Islands, are all Japanese territories and are now occupied by the United States; the Japanese government can demand their return, but it does not demand it. The former Japanese-mandated Pacific Islands—the Marshall, Mariana, and Caroline Islands—were only stipulated to be "separated" from Japan in the Cairo Declaration, and did not stipulate to which country they belonged, and are now also occupied by the United States. This is also a territorial issue. The Japanese government does not demand territory from the United States, but only demands the Southern Kuril Islands from the Soviet Union; in contrast, it can be understood that the territorial issue is not just a territorial issue, but a political issue. Everyone knows that those who oppose the Soviet-Japanese negotiations are using the territorial issue to undermine the Soviet-Japanese negotiations.

　　Two Obstacles
　　Negotiations should each go half the distance, and mutual concessions are necessary to reach an agreement. The Soviet Union has made all the concessions it can make. Japan is almost standing still. Therefore, the real reason why the Soviet-Japanese negotiations cannot reach an agreement is not in the above three issues, but because there are two obstacles. One is external pressure, that is, the interference of the United States; the other is internal constraints, that is, the pro-American faction within the Liberal Democratic Party, dancing to the tune of the United States. The two obstacles form an internal and external pincer movement against the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, colluding from the inside out.

　　It is strange that London was chosen as the starting point for the negotiations. Initially, the Japanese government did not approve of negotiations in its own capital, Tokyo, nor was it willing to go to the Soviet Union to negotiate. It suggested that the negotiations be held in New York. Because the Soviet government did not agree to New York, everyone had to travel far to London. It is not difficult to imagine how afraid the Japanese government is of the United States. Whenever the negotiations reached a critical juncture, the United States always interfered overtly or covertly, encouraging Japan to go to extremes. When the London negotiations were declared a failure, U.S. officials immediately said: "The breakdown of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations was not unexpected." They were overjoyed at the breakdown of the negotiations. Whenever the negotiations yielded a little result, the Japanese government would report to Washington, asking for instructions and begging for understanding. Ichiro Kono rushed to Washington to explain after signing the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement, which is one example. After interrupting the Moscow negotiations, Shigemitsu went to London, where he made a special visit to Dulles to seek advice on the territorial issue, which is another example.

　　The United States' method of undermining the negotiations is sometimes to pretend to stand on Japan's side, and sometimes to openly intimidate. When Dulles visited Japan in March of this year, he said to Hatoyama: "If the Japanese people exert their strength to deal with the issue of detained personnel, this issue should have been resolved in the Japanese-Soviet negotiations long ago." This was undermining the Soviet-Japanese negotiations with a tone of sympathy for Japan. In August of this year, Dulles told Shigemitsu in London that if Japan recognized the Soviet Union's sovereignty over the Kuril Islands, the United States might demand the permanent occupation of Okinawa under Article 26 of the San Francisco Treaty. At this time, Dulles was like a kidnapper writing a threatening letter. Despite Shigemitsu's repeated denial that Dulles had said the above, Dulles ruthlessly said in Washington on August 28th that he had asked Shigemitsu to pay attention to Article 26 of the San Francisco Treaty in London in order to notify Japan: "If it signs a treaty with Russia recognizing that the Soviet Union can control the Kuril Islands, then the United States may demand to acquire the Ryukyu Islands, including the Okinawa military base." He proved that Shigemitsu was lying and repeated his threatening words to Japan.

　　What does Article 26 of the San Francisco Treaty say? It reads like this: "...should Japan enter into a treaty of peace or war claims agreement with any State granting that State greater advantages than those provided herein, those same advantages shall be extended to the parties to this treaty."

　　Dulles, the Secretary of State who was a lawyer by trade, misquoted the legal provisions. First, the San Francisco Treaty has already stipulated that Japan renounce the Kuril Islands, and there is no issue of "granting" "greater advantages" here. Second, Article 26 also stipulates: "The obligations of Japan under this Article shall terminate three years from the date on which this treaty first comes into force." According to the San Francisco Treaty, which came into effect on April 28th, 1952, Japan had no obligation to comply with this provision after April 28th, 1955.

　　Therefore, the U.S. State Department went back to study the law. I don't know what law it was based on to conclude that the Yalta Agreement had no "legal effect." "Japan has no right to transfer the territory it declared renounced in the San Francisco Treaty to others." The United States wrote these explanations and other explanations into a memorandum, which was submitted to the Japanese government on September 7th. It is clear that it is trying to prevent the resolution of the territorial issue between the Soviet Union and Japan, and to use this issue as a pretext for anti-Sovietism forever.

　　The pro-American faction in Japan, representing the interests of Japanese comprador capital, has always supported the U.S. arguments, echoing them and playing a role in undermining the Soviet-Japanese negotiations. The Liberal Party was like this before the merger of the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party. On May 19th of last year, Liberal Party President Takeo Ogata said: "Our party is unwilling to be dragged into the diplomatic policy predicament that the Hatoyama government has fallen into," "does not want to participate in the Japanese-Russian negotiations." At that time, the "cautious theory" of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu within the Democratic Party was in tune with the Liberal Party's claims. After the merger of the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party in November of last year, the Soviet-Japanese negotiations became an internal party struggle within the party. Hatoyama's opposition, the so-called anti-mainstream faction, used this issue to oppose Hatoyama, trying to remove Hatoyama from the prime minister's chair. The pro-American Japanese Zaibatsu stood behind them, constantly clamoring against the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, and made a resolution on September 6th: demanding Hatoyama's retirement. According to a Kyodo News Agency dispatch from Washington on September 7th: "U.S. government officials are secretly supporting the widespread opinion in Japan demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Hatoyama." The United States' interference in internal affairs and subversive activities have a good market in Japan. Therefore, the internal party struggle within the Liberal Democratic Party actually also includes the struggle between independent diplomacy and comprador diplomacy.

　　A Trend
　　However, no matter how great the resistance is, there is a trend that cannot be stopped. This trend is that the Japanese nation wants independence and wants to restore diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union on the basis of independent diplomacy. After the Japanese cabinet approved Hatoyama's visit to the Soviet Union on October 2nd, Hatoyama said in a statement that restoring normal relations with the Soviet Union would enhance Japan's international status and complete Japan's true independence. Hatoyama's saying the four words "true independence" is meaningful.

　　Restoring diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union is a universal demand of the Japanese people. Hatoyama knows this, so he said on September 7th: "If I don't visit the Soviet Union, I will be letting down the people." Shigemitsu also knows this, so he said in Moscow on August 12th: "I want to be in step with the people and make the negotiations reach an agreement." Because the Hatoyama cabinet has not been in step with the people, and the Soviet-Japanese negotiations have been delayed for more than a year, its popularity is getting lower and lower, and the crisis is getting bigger and bigger. Delaying the negotiations is most unfavorable to the Hatoyama cabinet itself, and even to Hatoyama himself. Hatoyama and his partners took the slogan of restoring diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union as political capital to take the stage. It looks like this political capital will soon be lost. According to a public opinion poll published by the Tokyo "Asahi Shimbun" on September 7th, 41% of people clearly demanded the resignation of Hatoyama and his cabinet, and only 29% of people still supported it. This number is similar to the public opinion poll results before the collapse of the Ashida and Yoshida cabinets. The Hatoyama cabinet delayed the Soviet-Japanese negotiations to take care of the United States, but unfortunately it did not take care of itself. The current trend is that it can no longer be delayed.

　　Japan is a country that has always been independent and proud of it, and the Japanese people are people who are full of national self-esteem and love their country. No matter which regime, which politician, whoever violates the interests of Japanese national independence will be doomed to failure. After World War II, the colonial and semi-colonial countries in Asia and Africa have moved towards independence. The era of rampant imperialism is over. Recently, the Egyptian government announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, which has won the universal support of the people of the world. The Liberal Democratic Party should unite, and Japan has no need to fear the United States, and its backbone can be straighter. Implementing an independent and autonomous policy to normalize Japan's relations with the Soviet Union and China is fully in line with the national interests of the Japanese people. Whether the fourth Soviet-Japanese negotiations can succeed is a serious test for the Japanese Hatoyama government. It is hoped that the Hatoyama government will make a good choice.

### 苏日谈判以来

　　苏日谈判以来
　　李纯青
    日本首相鸠山一郎已经动身去访问苏联，以恢复苏日谈判。无论如何，这是一个值得欢迎的消息。一年前，西德总理阿登纳访问过苏联，并和苏联恢复了邦交。阿登纳可以那样做，鸠山当然也可以那样做。战争已经结束十一年，苏日两国之间还没有恢复正常关系。这是既不合理又不现实的。鸠山如果能以独立外交的精神去谈判，谈判是有成功的希望的。
    三次谈判
    苏日谈判已蹉跎了一年多的时日。这次鸠山访苏，是第四次谈判了。谈判最初在伦敦举行，从去年6月3日到今年3月20日，前后开过二十三次会议。苏联态度很积极，在第三次会议上，马立克就提出了苏日和约草案。但是日本不积极，故意在“被拘留人员”（日本战犯）问题上横生枝节，一再拖延不达成协议。去年9月21日，赫鲁晓夫对日本国会议员访苏团说过这样的话：“我们有这么一个印象，日本方面对苏联和日本两国关系正常化的问题并不特别感兴趣，因此在故意地拖延谈判。”但是，伦敦谈判到最后，双方还是就签订和约达成了十项协议，除掉领土问题没有解决以外，其它问题差不多都谈妥了。如果日本政府愿意进一步努力，不召回它的代表松本俊一，伦敦谈判是不会功亏一篑的。
    伦敦谈判失败以后，日本企图在没有邦交的状态下，单独解决北洋渔业问题。今年4月底，日本农林相河野一郎去莫斯科，这是第二次谈判。5月14日两国签订了苏日渔业条约和海上营救协定。
    因为这两个协议都规定从和约生效之日起或者苏日外交关系恢复之日起生效，同时，在苏日联合公报中规定不迟于7月31日恢复苏日关系正常化的谈判，这样，才使中断了的伦敦谈判得以重开。日本派遣外务相重光葵为全权代表，到莫斯科去，这是第三次谈判。这次谈判从7月31日起到8月13日为止，谢皮洛夫和重光进行了坦率而激烈的争辩，重光还见过一次布尔加宁。结果，过去一直主张对苏谈判要采取“慎重态度”的重光，也认为和约可以签字了。但是，因为日本政府内部意见不一致，互相大吵大闹，终于匆促决定：命令重光前往伦敦出席苏伊士运河问题的会议，拒绝签订苏日和约。他们的借口还是领土问题。这回重光说了老实话，他说和约不能签字不是条约的“条件问题”，而是一个“政治问题”。
    在重光拒绝签字以后，8月19日鸠山就表示愿意亲自访问苏联，以打开谈判的僵局。9月3日，重光经由美国回到东京。从那天起，鸠山便召开了一系列会议，调整和统一内部意见。9月7日鸠山提出新方案，即所谓“鸠山方式”，在暂时搁置领土问题不谈的前提下，向苏联要求五个条件：（1）宣布结束战争状态，恢复邦交；（2）互派大使；（3）立即遣返“被扣留人员”；（4）确认苏日渔业条约生效；（5）苏联无条件支持日本加入联合国。除重光还主张签订和约以外，基本上内阁同意鸠山的新方案。对于重光，鸠山说：“我同外务相在根本上意见不同，非要外务相辞职不可。”由于鸠山态度坚决，反对的意见就消沉下去。忽然，美国驻日大使艾利逊公开出面干涉，9月10日他向日本政府提出两点建议：一、小心苏联的做法；二、日苏谈判应该多花费些时间来进行。这就是说：行不得也鸠山！自由民主党一部分议员响应美国的干涉，到处兴风作浪。鸠山不得不迟迟其行。直到最近，据说是根据松本俊一从莫斯科打来电报，10月2日日本内阁才正式批准鸠山访苏。
    三个问题
    因为苏日谈判已经谈了一年多，鸠山访苏作第四次谈判，条件已比较成熟。过去麻烦的有三个问题。那就是：所谓送还“被扣留人员”；保持渔业权利；要求千岛群岛和南库页岛的领土。日本右派势力把这三个问题叫做对苏谈判“三原则”。
    在伦敦谈判开始的时候，日本代表便提出要先释放“被扣留人员”问题，硬说在苏联有一万多名日本人，并说释放是“人道问题”，与和约无关，以此拒绝商谈和约草案。事实上，在苏联并没有被扣留的日本平民，只有已经判决而在服刑的一千多名日本战犯。日本战犯在外国服刑的有的是，在美国还有二百多名，在澳大利亚还有一百四十九名，在荷兰还有一百三十一名，在英国还有八十名……。这些国家已于1951年9月同日本签订“和约”，日本并没有向他们提出“人道问题”，也不要求他们释放日本战犯。苏日之间还没有结束战争状态，日本就要求先放还在苏联服刑的日本战犯。这是无理取闹。虽然如此，苏联政府从去年7月起，还是陆续释放了几批可以释放的日本战犯。这问题不是不能解决的。如果说，苏日恢复邦交能使日本战犯归国更方便些，那么，拖延谈判就是日本政府不要战犯归国。
    关于北洋渔业问题，过去是日本帝国主义的一种特权。因为日本打败了帝俄，在朴茨茅斯条约中，帝俄承认日本可以在俄国领海内捕鱼。战前这个问题一直是日本反苏的工具。今年3月21日，苏联政府宣布在鲑鱼、鳟鱼产卵期间——5月15日到9月15日，限制北洋渔区捕鱼量为二千五百万条。这是为了保护鱼源。日本在北洋滥事捕鱼，去年捕过六千四百万条，今年计划超出一亿条。虽然如此，今年5月在伊什科夫同河野一郎谈判中，苏联政府还是照顾日本渔民的要求，今年的临时协定把捕鱼量放宽到六万五千吨，大约是三千二百五十万条。如果说，苏日恢复邦交对于日本北洋渔业更方便，那么，拖延谈判就是日本政府不重视日本渔民的利益。这也是清楚的道理。
    最后一个问题是领土问题。根据第二次世界大战期间的国际协议，即根据开罗宣言、雅尔塔协定、以及在这两个协议的基础上向日本提出并为日本所接受的波茨坦公告，苏日之间并没有领土问题。如果按照国际协议办事，苏日之间的领土问题是已经解决了的。那就是：
    根据雅尔塔协定第二条第一款：“库页岛南部及邻近一切岛屿须交还苏联”。第三条规定：“千岛群岛须交予苏联”。
    这规定是十分明确的。正是因为日本承认雅尔塔协定，美国也承认这个协定，所以在1951年9月签字的“旧金山对日和约”第二条第三款中才规定：“日本放弃对千岛群岛及由1905年9月5日朴朴茨斯条约所获得主权之库页岛一部分及其附近岛屿之一切权利、权利根据与要求。”当时日本政府并没有要求要千岛群岛，也没有要求要千岛群岛南部。在法律上，日本已经放弃了千岛群岛。千岛群岛当然包括千岛群岛的南部在内。但是，现在日本要求苏联放弃色丹和齿舞两岛的主权，还要求苏联放弃千岛群岛南部的国后岛和择捉岛。
    事实上，日本投降以后，上述四个岛屿已经在苏联政府管理之下，岛上二万多名日本居民都已经撤退回国去了。
    去年9月21日，赫鲁晓夫对日本国会议员访苏团说，齿舞岛和色丹岛的问题本来也是由国际协定解决了的，但苏联可以考虑使这两个岛的问题获得有利于日本的解决。在苏日谈判中，苏联已经同意在签订和约的前提下可以把上述两个岛屿移交给日本。但是日本不同意，它还要国后岛和择捉岛，即要南千岛群岛。
    根据波茨坦公告第八条：“日本之主权必将限于本州、北海道、九州、四国及吾人所决定其他小岛之内。”这条所指的没有决定的“其他小岛”，例如小笠原群岛、硫黄群岛，都是日本的领土，而现在被美国侵占了去；日本政府可以要求归还，但是它并不要求。前日本太平洋代管岛屿——马绍尔、马利亚纳、加罗林三个群岛，在开罗宣言中只规定从日本“剥夺”出来，并没有规定归属何国，现在也被美国侵占了去。这也是一个领土问题。日本政府不向美国要求领土，单单向苏联要求南千岛群岛；在对比之下可以了解，领土问题不仅是领土问题，而是政治问题。谁都知道，反对苏日谈判的人，都在利用领土问题破坏苏日谈判。
    两种阻力
    谈判应该各走一半路程，互相让步才能达成协议。苏联能够让步的，都已经作了让步。日本几乎是站着不动。因此，苏日谈判不能达成协议，真正原因不在上述三个问题，而是因为有两种阻力。一种是外部压力，即美国的干涉；另一种是内部牵制，即在自由民主党内的亲美派，按照美国的笛音跳舞。两种阻力对苏、日谈判形成内外夹攻，里应外合。
    选择伦敦作开始谈判的地点就很奇怪。最初，日本政府不赞成在自己的国都东京谈判，也不愿意到苏联谈判，它建议谈判在纽约举行。因为苏联政府不同意纽约，只好大家远走伦敦。不难想像，日本政府是多么害怕美国呀。每当谈判到重要关头，美国总是或明或暗地出来干涉，鼓励日本走向极端。在伦敦谈判宣告失败的时候，美国官员马上就说：“苏日谈判决裂并不出乎意外。”他们是为谈判决裂而欢欣鼓舞的。每当谈判有一点结果，日本政府便向华盛顿报告，请示，乞求谅解。河野一郎在签订苏日渔约以后，行色匆匆地赶到华盛顿进行解释，就是一例。重光在中断莫斯科谈判后到伦敦，就在伦敦专诚拜访杜勒斯，请教领土问题，这又是一例。
    美国破坏谈判的手法，有时是假装站在日本一边，有时是公开进行恫吓。今年3月杜勒斯访问日本，他对鸠山说：“如果日本国民发挥力量，去对付被扣留人员问题，这个问题早应该在日苏谈判中获得解决了。”这是用同情日本的口吻破坏苏日谈判。今年8月，杜勒斯在伦敦对重光说，如果日本承认苏联对千岛群岛的主权，美国可能根据旧金山和约第26条要求永久占领琉球。这时候，杜勒斯就像写恐吓信的绑匪一样。尽管重光一再否认杜勒斯说过上面的话，但8月28日，杜勒斯在华盛顿无情地说，他在伦敦请重光注意旧金山和约第26条，为的是通知日本：“如果它和俄国签订和约时承认苏联可以控制千岛群岛的话，那么美国可能要求取得包括冲绳军事基地在内的琉球群岛。”他证明重光撒谎，重复一遍他对日本威胁的话。
    旧金山和约第26条写些什么呢？它是这样写的：“……倘日本与任何国家成立一媾和协议或战争赔偿协议，给予该国以较本约规定更大之利益时，则此等利益应同样给予本约之缔约国。”
    杜勒斯，这个律师出身的国务卿，引错了法律条文了。第一、旧金山和约已经规定日本放弃千岛群岛，这里没有“给予”“更大之利益”之类的问题。第二、第26条同时规定：“日本之此项义务，将于本约最初生效后三年届满时终止。”按旧金山和约是在1952年4月28日生效的，在1955年4月28日以后，日本就没有遵守这条规定的义务了。
    因此，美国国务院又去研究法律。不知道根据什么法律得出结论说：雅尔塔协定没有“法律效果”。“日本是没有权利把它在旧金山和约上声明放弃的领土移交给别人的”。美国把这些解释和其它的解释写成备忘录，于9月7日送交日本政府。很明显，它是企图阻止解决苏日之间的领土问题，要把这问题永远作为反苏的口实。
    日本国内的亲美派，代表日本买办资本的利益，一向支持美国的论点，跟着起哄，起着破坏苏日谈判的作用。在自由党和民主党两党合并以前，自由党就是这样。去年5月19日，自由党总裁绪方竹虎说：“我们的党，不愿意被拖进鸠山政府所陷入的外交政策的绝境中去”，“不想参加日俄谈判”。当时，民主党内重光外相的“慎重论”，是和自由党的主张异曲同工的。去年11月，自由党和民主党两党合并以后，苏日谈判就成为该党内部党争问题了。鸠山的反对派，即所谓反主流派，利用这个问题反对鸠山，要把鸠山从首相的椅子上请下来。亲美的日本财阀则站在背后帮腔，不断叫嚷反对苏日谈判，并于9月6日作出一项决议：要求鸠山退休。据共同社9月7日华盛顿电：“美国政府人士正在暗中支持日本国内广泛存在的要求鸠山首相下台的意见。”美国的干涉内政和颠复活动，在日本有良好的市场。因此，自由民主党内部的党争问题，实际也就包含着独立外交同买办外交的斗争。
    一个趋势
    但是，不论阻力多么大，有一个趋势是不可阻挡的。这个趋势就是日本民族要独立，要在独立外交的基础上，同中苏两国恢复邦交。10月2日日本内阁批准鸠山访苏之后，鸠山发表谈话就提到：同苏联恢复正常关系会提高日本的国际地位，完成日本的真正独立。鸠山说出“真正独立”这四个字是意味深长的。
    日本同苏联恢复邦交，这是日本人民普遍的要求。鸠山知道这一点，所以9月7日他说：“我不去访问苏联，对不起国民。”重光也知道这一点，所以8月12日他在莫斯科说：“我想和国民齐一步调，使谈判达成协议。”因为鸠山内阁没有和国民齐一步调，苏日谈判拖了一年多，所以它的人望越来越低，危机越来越大。拖延谈判对鸠山内阁本身，以至对鸠山本人，都是最不利的。鸠山和他的伙伴，以同中苏两国恢复邦交的口号为政治资本走上舞台，看看这份政治资本将快输光了。据9月7日东京“朝日新闻”发表的民意测验，已有41％的人明确地要求鸠山和他的内阁辞职，只有29％的人还支持它。这个数字，和芦田、吉田两个内阁垮台前的民意测验结果差不多。鸠山内阁拖延苏日谈判照顾了美国，可惜它没有照顾自己。现在的趋势是再也拖不下去了。
    日本是一向独立并以此自豪的国家，日本人民是富有民族自尊心和热爱祖国的人民。不论哪个政权，哪个政治家，谁要违背日本民族独立的利益，谁就要遭到失败。第二次大战后，亚非两洲的殖民地和半殖民地国家已纷纷走向独立。帝国主义横行无忌的时代已经过去。最近埃及政府宣布苏伊士运河公司国有化，获得世界人民普遍的声援。自由民主党应该团结起来，日本没有害怕美国的必要，腰板可以挺硬一点。执行独立自主的政策，使日本同苏联、中国关系正常化，是完全符合日本人民的民族利益的。第四次日苏谈判能否成功，对日本鸠山政府乃是一个严重的考验。希望鸠山政府善自抉择。
