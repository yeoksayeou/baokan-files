Always Think of the Masses

Yao Fu

Recently, this newspaper has received many letters from readers reflecting that some grassroots trade union organizations have problems such as being divorced from the masses, acting arbitrarily, and engaging in corruption when handling subsidies and resolving some employees' debts. The criticism of Comrade Zhao Guochao published in this newspaper today regarding Zhao Zhonghe, chairman of the No. 296 Factory's trade union, and vice-chairmen Shen Xingfa and Liu Weiguo shielding each other and infringing on the interests of the masses is a typical example.

Such examples are not unique. Fu Xingyi, a secretary in the office of the Beijing No. 3 Construction Engineering Company, had savings of 1,000 yuan at home, but was still given 100 yuan in subsidies to repay "debts" when subsidies were distributed. A trade union chairman of a printing factory usually did not pay attention to thrift and ran up a lot of debt. When he was in charge of subsidies, he shouted loudly to the masses about "opposing speculative thinking," but secretly received a subsidy for himself. Therefore, the masses said they were a "small clique" and "trade union bureaucrats."

Originally, protecting the material interests and democratic rights of employees, and constantly influencing and educating the broad masses of employees with communist spirit, is the special and glorious task of the trade union. However, in actual work, some leaders do not cherish this glory. People like Zhao Zhonghe and Liu Weiguo, as trade union leaders, did not follow the mass line and consult with the masses when handling subsidies, and did not influence the masses with their own exemplary actions. On the contrary, they used their power to turn public affairs related to the broad masses into the private affairs of a few people, taking advantage of loopholes and gaining petty advantages. How can such a style of work do a good job of leadership?

In addition, some trade union cadres often only know how to ask the administration for money, and rarely consider how to use the money in their hands to serve the masses in a timely and reasonable manner. As a result, on the one hand, many members' hardship subsidies are backlogged, and on the other hand, some members cannot afford single clothes in summer or cotton clothes in winter; on the one hand, a lot of labor insurance funds are backlogged, and on the other hand, some members cannot increase their nutrition when they are sick, or send their children to nurseries after they are born; on the one hand, cultural and educational funds are backlogged, and on the other hand, no new teachers have been added to the spare-time school, there are no basketballs on the playground, no poker in the club, and no newly published books and newspapers in the library. This situation not only aroused dissatisfaction among the masses, but also lost the prestige of the trade union.

In our country, the tasks of the trade union are very important. It is not only a communist school for employees, but also directly or indirectly participates in and implements certain powers entrusted by state organs. The large number of welfare expenses managed and used by the trade union is one of the core contents of this right. Whether this fund is used properly directly affects the production and work enthusiasm of the employees. It can be seen that giving full play to democracy and enlivening the democratic life of the trade union is more important today than ever before. In order to do a good job in the trade union, trade union leaders should always think of the masses and consult with the masses in everything. Many facts have proved that where the mass line is adhered to and the interests of the masses are cared for, there will be vitality and a large number of activists will emerge, strengthening the connection between the trade union and the masses; where the democratic system is not adhered to, work is not reported to the masses, and the interests of the masses are ignored, the dust of bureaucracy will be stained, and activists will slowly decline. Party organizations at all levels should always supervise trade union cadres to promote a democratic style of work, oppose the bureaucratic style of trade union cadres, and enliven the democratic life of the trade union.

    事事为群众着想
    药夫
    最近，本报收到不少读者来信，反映某些工会基层组织在处理补助费、解决部分职工欠债问题的时候，存在着脱离群众，独断专行，营私舞弊的现象。今天本报发表的朝国同志批评二九六厂工会主席赵中和、副主席申兴发、刘卫国互相包庇，侵占群众利益的行为，就是一个典型的例子。
    像这样的例子还不是绝无仅有的。北京市第三建筑工程公司办公室秘书傅行宜，家里有存款一千元，在发放补助费的时候，又发给他一百元偿还“欠债”；有一个印刷厂的工会主席，平时不注意节约，欠下一身债，他在掌握补助费的时候，一方面向群众大叫“反对投机思想”，一方面却偷偷地给自己领到了一笔补助费，因此，群众说他们是“小集团”，是“工会官僚”。
    本来，保护职工的物质利益和民主权利，经常以共产主义精神来影响、教育广大职工群众，是工会特殊的光荣任务。然而，在实际工作中偏偏有一种领导人员不珍惜这个光荣。像赵中和、刘卫国身为工会领导人员，在处理补助费的时候，不但没有走群众路线，同群众商量，用自己的模范行动影响群众；相反，他们却利用职权，把关系到广大群众的公事，变成几个人的私事，从中钻空子，占便宜。试问这样的作风，怎能做好领导工作呢？
    另外，也有某些工会干部往往只知向行政张手要钱，对于自己手里的钱，如何及时合理地为群众办事，却很少考虑。于是，一方面有许多会员的困难补助费被积压了，另一方面，有的会员夏天穿不上单衣，冬天穿不上棉衣；一方面把许多劳动保险基金积压了，另一方面，有的会员生了病无法增加营养，生了孩子送不进托儿所；一方面积压了文教经费，另一方面业余学校没有添上新的教员，操场上没有篮球，俱乐部没有扑克，图书馆没有新出版的书刊和报纸。这种情况，不仅引起了群众不满，而且也丧失了工会的威信。
    在我们的国家里，工会的任务十分重大，它既是职工的共产主义学校，又直接或间接参与并执行国家机关委托的某些职权，大批福利费用由工会掌管和使用，就是这种权利的中心内容之一。这笔款项使用是否得当，直接影响着职工群众的生产和工作情绪。可见，充分发扬民主，活跃工会民主生活，今天比任何时候都重要了。为了做好工会工作，工会领导人员应该事事为群众着想，事事同群众商量。许多事实证明：那里坚持群众路线，关心群众利益，那里就会生气勃勃，不断涌现大批积极分子，加强了工会与群众的联系；那里不坚持民主制度，不向群众报告工作，漠视群众利益，那里就会染上官僚主义的灰尘，积极分子也会慢慢消沉下去。各级党组织应该时刻监督工会干部发扬民主作风，反对工会干部的官僚主义作风，把工会民主生活活跃起来。
