Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The section of the Lanxin Railway from Sandaogou to Hami will be constructed to accommodate internal combustion locomotives. A locomotive depot capable of servicing both internal combustion and steam locomotives, along with over one hundred kilometers of track work, are currently undergoing full-scale construction.

The Sandaogou-Hami section of the railway is over 390 kilometers long and represents the most arid section of the Lanxin Railway, traversing the Gobi Desert. If internal combustion locomotives run on this section, the construction of water supply stations and other projects along the route can be avoided. Internal combustion locomotives are more powerful and faster, and they can haul more goods than steam locomotives. However, to run internal combustion locomotives, it is necessary to build a locomotive depot to maintain these new types of locomotives and special equipment for fueling them.

The Sandaogou-Hami section of the railway will be the first railway in our country built to run internal combustion locomotives.

    三道沟至哈密将行驶内燃机车
    据新华社讯　兰新铁路三道沟至哈密一段将要建设成行驶内燃机车的铁路。一个内燃机车、蒸气机车两用的机车库和一百多公里的线路工程，现在正在进行全面施工。
    三道沟——哈密段铁路，长三百九十多公里，是兰新铁路穿过大戈壁缺水最严重的一段。这段路线如果行驶内燃机车，就可以省掉在沿线建设给水站等工程；内燃机车力量大、跑得快，拉的东西要比蒸气机车多。但是，要行驶内燃机车，需要建设检修这种新型机车的机车库和机车给油的特殊设备。
    三道沟——哈密一段铁路，将是我国最先建成的行驶内燃机车的铁路。
