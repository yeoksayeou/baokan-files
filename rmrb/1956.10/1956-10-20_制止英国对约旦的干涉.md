    Curbing British Interference in Jordan

    Having repeatedly suffered setbacks on the Suez Canal issue, Western colonial powers, particularly Britain, are intensifying their efforts to exploit the Israeli attacks on the Jordanian border to create new political intrigues in the Middle East. They aim both to divide the close unity of the Arab countries, weaken Egypt's strong position on the Suez Canal issue due to the full support of all Arab countries, and restore their rule over Jordan. This is one of the so-called "trump cards" that Western countries have recently repeatedly claimed they haven't fully used against Egypt and the Arab countries.

    The most obvious evidence of this political conspiracy to split the Arab countries is the British government's constant clamoring for intervention in the Israeli attacks on Jordan. The British and other Western colonial powers are acting in this way: on the one hand, they support Israel's military provocations against Jordan, threatening the peace and security of Arab countries; on the other hand, they openly claim that if a war breaks out due to Israeli aggression against Jordan, the British government will fulfill its obligations under the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty and send troops to "aid" Jordan. At the same time, Britain has recently intensified its efforts to instigate its Baghdad Pact ally, Iraq, to send troops into Jordan under the guise of maintaining the security of Jordan's rear. The real intention of Britain's actions is to use this as a disguised occupation of Jordan, restore its old rule over Jordan, and finally drag Jordan into the Baghdad military bloc. As British Labour MP Crossman pointed out, Britain's actions are "not to protect this country (Jordan) against Israel, but to seize this country." Many reports indicate that this British political conspiracy has the consent and tacit approval of the United States.

    Britain's intensified promotion of this political conspiracy at present is clearly because Jordan is about to hold parliamentary elections on October 21. It fears that anti-colonial forces will continue to gain greater victories in Jordan, which would be even more detrimental to its position in Jordan and bring even more unfavorable consequences for Western countries on the Suez Canal issue. Therefore, it is trying to control Jordan's elections. According to Western newspapers, the British Chargé d'Affaires in Israel has repeatedly assured the Israeli government that the entry of Iraqi troops into Jordan will not constitute an attack on Israel. One of the main contents of the meeting between the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary with the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister a few days ago was to urge France to help Britain persuade Israel to believe that the stationing of Iraqi troops in Jordan is necessary, but by no means targeted at Israel. These situations expose the real motives behind Britain's instigation of Iraq to send troops to Jordan.

    However, the Jordanian people have long seen through Britain's intentions. They resolutely oppose Britain sending troops into Jordan under the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty. Most of the political parties participating in the parliamentary elections this time demand the abolition of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty and cooperation with Egypt and Syria, which pursue independent foreign policies. At the same time, the Jordanian government has decided not to conduct negotiations with Iraq alone regarding the entry of Iraqi troops into Jordan. Jordan has requested all Arab countries to provide military and financial assistance, and has stated that it does not need anyone to help maintain domestic order.

    This just action of the Jordanian government and people in safeguarding their independence and sovereignty has gained the sympathy and support of the people of all peace-loving countries, especially the full support of other Arab countries. The Egyptian Minister of Defense recently stated that if Jordan is invaded or threatened with invasion, the Egyptian armed forces will immediately join the battle. The Syrian government has provided assistance to Jordan in accordance with the Syrian-Jordanian border defense treaty. The Arab League Council is also meeting to discuss the issue of assisting Jordan. With the Arab countries united and supporting each other, they will surely be able to defeat the political conspiracies orchestrated by Britain and any aggressive forces in the Middle East and ensure the peace and security of Arab countries.

### 制止英国对约旦的干涉

    制止英国对约旦的干涉
    在苏伊士运河问题上一再遭受挫折之后，西方殖民主义国家、特别是英国，正在加紧利用以色列袭击约旦边境的事件，在中近东地区制造新的政治阴谋，企图既能分裂阿拉伯国家的紧密团结，削弱埃及在苏伊士运河问题上由于得到各阿拉伯国家全力支持而拥有的有力地位，又能恢复对约旦的统治。这就是西方国家最近所多次声称的对埃及和阿拉伯国家没有使尽的所谓“王牌”之一。
    这个企图分裂阿拉伯国家的政治阴谋，最明显的事实是英国政府不断扬言要干涉以色列袭击约旦的事件。英国和其他西方殖民主义国家的作法是：一方面支持以色列向约旦进行军事挑衅，威胁阿拉伯国家的和平安全；另一方面又公开声称，如果发生以色列侵犯约旦的战争，英国政府就要履行英约（旦）条约所规定的义务，出兵“援助”约旦。同时，英国最近加紧唆使它的巴格达条约盟国伊拉克，以维持约旦后方治安为名，派兵进入约旦。英国这种作法的真实意图是想借此变相地占领约旦，恢复自己对约旦的旧有统治，最后把约旦拖进巴格达军事集团。这正如英国工党议员克罗斯曼所指出的，英国的作法，“不是为了保护这个国家（约旦）抵抗以色列，而是为了攫取这个国家”。许多消息表明，英国的这个政治阴谋，是得到美国的同意和默契的。
    英国在目前加紧策动这个政治阴谋，显然是因为约旦就要在10月21日进行议会选举，它害怕反殖民主义力量继续在约旦获得更大的胜利，对它在约旦的地位更加不利，在苏伊士运河问题上带来对西方国家更加不利的后果，因此它力图控制约旦的选举。据西方报纸说，英国驻以色列的代办，就曾数度向以色列政府保证，伊拉克派兵进入约旦，不会构成对以色列的攻击行动。前几天，英国首相和外交大臣同法国总理和外交部长会谈的主要内容之一，也是为了敦促法国帮助英国去说服以色列，使它相信伊拉克部队进驻约旦是必须的，但绝不是针对以色列。这些情况都暴露了英国策动伊拉克派兵进驻约旦的真正动机。
    但是，约旦人民早就看破了英国的企图。他们坚决反对英国根据英约（旦）条约派兵进入约旦。这次参加议会选举的大多数政党，都要求废除英约（旦）条约，并且要求同实行独立外交政策的埃及和叙利亚合作。同时，约旦政府已经决定不单独同伊拉克进行关于伊拉克部队进驻约旦的谈判。约旦已要求所有阿拉伯国家给予军事援助和财政援助，并且表示不需要任何人来帮助维持国内秩序。
    约旦政府和人民这种维护自己独立和主权的正义行动，已经得到所有爱好和平国家人民的同情和支持，特别是得到了其他阿拉伯国家的全力支持。埃及国防部长最近表示，一旦约旦受到侵略或者侵略的威胁，埃及武装部队就会立即投入战斗。叙利亚政府已根据叙利亚—约旦边境防御条约，对约旦进行援助。阿拉伯联盟理事会也正在开会，讨论援助约旦的问题。阿拉伯国家团结一致，互相支持，就一定能够打败英国和任何侵略势力在中近东所策动的政治阴谋，保障阿拉伯国家的和平安全。
