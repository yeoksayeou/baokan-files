Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 28th: Hong Kong news: The Nan Hua Toys Metal Products Factory and the Yau Yan Weaving Factory, which suffered severe damage and looting in the Kowloon riots, recently wrote to the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Manufacturers' Association respectively, demanding that the Hong Kong British authorities severely punish the culprits and effectively guarantee the safety of residents' lives and property.

    The letter from Nan Hua Toys Metal Products Factory to the Chinese Manufacturers' Association described how Kuomintang special agents and rioters repeatedly and wantonly looted the factory's tools and equipment, damaged machinery, and beat employees on that day, and how no military police came to intervene, resulting in heavy losses. It demanded that the Hong Kong British authorities arrest the main culprits among the rioters, bring them to justice in accordance with the law, and ensure that the safety of the lives and property of residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon is effectively guaranteed in the future. The letter also requested that the relevant authorities do their best to recover the stolen goods, properly handle all aftermath matters, and ensure that the interests of the factory and other affected residents are adequately compensated.

    The Yau Yan Weaving Factory said in its letter to the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Manufacturers' Association that the factory was attacked by Kuomintang special agents and rioters throwing stones during the period when the Hong Kong British authorities had already declared "martial law." The letter stated: The Hong Kong British authorities should be responsible for handling the aftermath of the damage suffered by the factory this time, and should severely punish the instigators and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again in the future, so as to ensure the safety of residents' lives and property.

    要求香港英国当局严惩凶手
    新华社广州28日电　香港消息：在九龙暴乱中受到严重破坏和劫掠的南华玩具金属制品厂和友仁织带厂最近分别写信给中华总商会和中华厂商联合会，要求香港英国当局严厉惩办凶手，切实保证居民生命财产的安全。
    南华玩具金属制品厂写给中华厂商联合会的信里叙述了当日国民党特务及暴徒先后几次肆意劫夺这个工厂的工具、器材，还破坏机器、殴打职员，而且没有军警前来干涉，以致损失惨重的情况后，要求香港英国当局严缉暴徒中的元凶归案，依法究办，务使今后港九居民生命财产的安全获得切实保障。信里还要求有关当局尽力追回赃物，妥办一切善后事宜，使这个工厂和其他受害居民的利益获得适当弥补。
    友仁织带厂在写给中华总商会和中华厂商联合会的信里说，这个工厂是在香港英国当局已经宣布“戒严”的期间受到国民党特务及暴徒的掷石攻击的。信里说：这个工厂这次蒙受损害，香港英国当局应该担负办理善后之责，并应严惩祸首，保证以后不再有同类的事件发生，使居民生命财产的安全获得保障。
