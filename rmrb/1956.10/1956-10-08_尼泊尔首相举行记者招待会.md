Xinhua News Agency, 7th - The Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal, Tanka Prasad Acharya, held a press conference in Beijing on the evening of the 7th.

The Prime Minister first spoke of his impressions of China, saying that he had a wonderful time in China. In a friendly atmosphere, he met with the leaders of the Chinese government. There is no great-power chauvinism or complacency in China. The Prime Minister was deeply impressed by the Chinese people's infinite enthusiasm for construction and their boundless confidence in the future.

The Prime Minister announced that the Chinese government has agreed to provide the Kingdom of Nepal with 60 million Indian rupees in grant aid over three years to help implement Nepal's first five-year plan.

He also said, "This economic assistance does not come with any conditions, nor does it send technicians to Nepal. The funds and materials of the assistance are entirely at the free disposal of the Nepalese government, and the Chinese government does not interfere."

Referring to the "Agreement between the Kingdom of Nepal and the People's Republic of China on Maintaining Friendly Relations and on Trade and Transportation between Nepal and the Tibet Region of China" recently signed in Kathmandu, the Prime Minister said that the agreement would have a very good impact because it is based on Panchsheel.

The Prime Minister also said that, based on a spirit of friendship and equality, the foreign exchange problems of Nepalese merchants in Tibet are no longer a problem. He said that he believed the Chinese government would give them appropriate facilitation.

Prime Minister Acharya pointed out that the friendly relations between China, Nepal, and India can be strengthened through mutual contact, economic cooperation, cultural exchange, and peace movements. He specifically mentioned the visit of a Nepalese cultural delegation to China two months ago, and that Nepal has also invited a Chinese cultural delegation to visit Nepal. He said that such exchanges are very helpful to mutual understanding.

A reporter asked about the Nepalese government's position on the Suez Canal issue. The Prime Minister said that Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal is beyond doubt and must be guaranteed. The Nepalese government believes that the best way to peacefully resolve the Suez Canal issue is for each country using the canal to sign bilateral agreements with the Egyptian government on navigation issues.

The Prime Minister said that the establishment of the "Users' Association" is an act of putting pressure on Egypt, which is inappropriate. He said that this is tantamount to putting the cart before the horse. Each user country should first sign an agreement with Egypt, rather than organizing a "Users' Association" first.

In response to a question about Nepal's economic construction, Prime Minister Acharya said, "We have also begun to implement our first five-year construction plan this year." He also said that Nepal's first five-year plan will first develop transportation to solve the current domestic transportation difficulties, and at the same time develop medium-sized industries, handicrafts, and agricultural technology.

When introducing the upcoming general election in Nepal next year, the Prime Minister said that Nepal is making smooth progress in various preparations and is expected to be held on schedule.

He also said that Nepal has provisions to protect women's rights, and said that "after the general election, there will definitely be women participating in parliament."

    尼泊尔首相举行记者招待会
    新华社7日讯　尼泊尔王国首相坦卡·普拉萨德·阿查里雅7日晚在北京举行记者招待会。
    首相首先谈到他在中国的观感说，他在中国的日子过得很好。在友好的气氛中，他会见了中国政府的领导人。在中国没有任何大国主义和自满的倾向。首相对中国人民对建设的无穷热情和对未来的无限信心有深刻的印象。
    首相宣布，中国政府已同意在三年内无偿地援助尼泊尔王国六千万印度卢比，来帮助尼泊尔第一个五年计划的执行。
    他还说，“这个经济援助并不附带任何条件，也不派遣技术人员前往尼泊尔，援助的款项和物资完全由尼泊尔政府自由使用，中国政府不加干涉。”
    谈到最近在加德满都签订的“尼泊尔王国和中华人民共和国保持友好关系以及关于尼泊尔和中国西藏地方之间的通商和交通的协定”的时候，首相说这个协定会产生很好的影响，因为它的基础是潘查希拉。
    首相又说，在友好精神和平等的基础上，在西藏的尼泊尔商人的外汇问题已经不成为问题。他说，他相信中国政府会给他们以适当的便利。
    阿查里雅首相指出，中国、尼泊尔和印度之间的友好关系可以通过诸如相互接触、经济合作、文化交流以及和平运动来加强。他特别提到两个月以前尼泊尔文化代表团访问了中国，尼泊尔也已经邀请一个中国文化代表团到尼泊尔去访问。他说，这种往来对彼此的了解很有助益。
    有记者问到尼泊尔政府在苏伊士运河问题上的立场。首相说，埃及对苏伊士运河的主权是不容怀疑的，必须得到保障。尼泊尔政府认为，和平解决苏伊士运河问题的最好办法是每一个使用运河的国家就航行问题同埃及政府签订双边协定。
    首相说，成立“使用国协会”是对埃及施加压力的行为，这是不适当的。他说，这等于是把车子套在马的前面，应当是由每个使用国先同埃及签订协定，而不是先组织“使用国协会”。
    在回答关于尼泊尔经济建设情况时，阿查里雅首相说，“我们今年也已开始实行第一个五年建设计划”，他并且说尼泊尔的第一个五年计划将首先发展交通事业以解决目前国内的交通困难，同时发展中等工业、手工业和农业技术。
    首相在介绍尼泊尔明年即将实行的大选的情况时，他说尼泊尔正在顺利进行各种准备工作，预料将按期举行。
    他还说尼泊尔对妇女权利有规定加以保障，并说“在大选后必定会有妇女参加议会”。
