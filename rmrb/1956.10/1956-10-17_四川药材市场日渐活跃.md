Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 14th: Since Sichuan Province implemented free trading and free transportation of medicinal materials starting in June, the quantity of medicinal materials entering the market has gradually increased. According to statistics from the Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the province purchased more than 356,000 dan of medicinal materials in the third quarter, an increase of more than 10% compared to the same period last year. The purchase volume in ten major medicinal material producing areas increased by nearly one-third compared to the same period last year. Many medicinal materials that had been out of stock for a long time are now available on the market. Forty-eight kinds of medicinal materials that were out of stock in Chengdu in June are now in supply.

Sichuan is one of China's major medicinal material producing areas. However, in the previous period, due to excessively strict management of medicinal material transportation and prices by relevant departments, general medicinal material merchants were restricted to buying and selling locally, which once caused a tense situation in the supply of medicinal materials within the province.

In June of this year, the medicinal material management departments in various parts of Sichuan Province changed this operating method, allowing merchants to freely transport medicinal materials. Regarding prices, buyers and sellers are allowed to negotiate prices, but generally, they should not exceed the local listed price by more than 10%. This has brought vitality to the medicinal material market. Medicinal material merchants in the Jiangjin Special District immediately went to medicinal material distribution markets in Chengdu, Guizhou, and other places to transport materials and went deep into the countryside for small-scale purchases. Emei County purchased 227 kinds of medicinal materials in the third quarter, whereas before, they could only purchase more than 90 kinds.

After the medicinal material market was opened, many foreign medicinal material merchants came to Sichuan to trade medicinal materials. Since the third quarter, medicinal material merchants from Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, Guizhou, and other places have come to Sichuan one after another. They brought winter flowers, raw rehmannia, musk lotus, and other medicinal materials needed by Sichuan, and purchased musk, trifoliate orange, and other medicinal materials from Sichuan.

    四川药材市场日渐活跃
    新华社成都14日电　四川省从6月份开始实行药材自由成交、自由贩运以来，药材上市量逐渐上升。据四川省供销合作社统计，第三季度全省收购药材三十五万六千多担，比去年同期增加10％以上，十个药材主要产地的收购量比去年同期增加将近三分之一。许多长期脱销的药材，现在已有上市。成都市6月份脱销的四十八种药材，现在已有供应了。
    四川是我国药材主要产地之一。但是，前一时期由于有关部门对中药材贩运和价格管理得过严，一般药材商贩被限制在当地买当地卖，曾经一度造成省内药材供应的紧张状况。
    今年6月份，四川省各地中药材管理部门改变这种经营办法，允许商贩自由贩运药材；在价格方面，允许买卖双方协商议价，但一般不得超出当地牌价10％左右。这样便给药材市场带来了活跃。江津专区的中药材商贩就立即到成都、贵州等地药材集散市场贩运，并深入乡村零星收购。峨眉县第三季度收购药材二百二十七种，而在这以前，只能收购到九十多种。
    药材市场开放以后，不少外地药材商贩来四川进行药材交易。第三季度以来，陕西、甘肃、河南、贵州等地药材商先后来过四川，他们运来了四川需要的冬花、生地、麝荷等药材，从四川买去了麝香、枳壳等药材。
