Xinhua News Agency, October 29th. The first National Conference of Activists in Science and Technology Popularization Among Workers opened in Beijing this afternoon. This conference is jointly convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization in order to further mobilize workers nationwide to advance towards science and technology.

	There are over a thousand official delegates attending the conference. They were selected and invited through conferences held by trade unions and science and technology popularization associations in twenty-five provinces, autonomous regions, and three municipalities directly under the central government, as well as the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army and departments of agriculture, culture, railways, etc. They include activists in science and technology propaganda, organizers, and learners. Among the delegates are university professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, middle school teachers, scientific researchers, engineers, technicians, medical workers, cultural workers, trade union workers, workers, staff members of factories, mines, and government organs, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army; among them are famous scientists, engineers, and advanced workers from factories and mines. Forty-nine observers are also participating in the conference.

	The conference is scheduled to last six days, reviewing the achievements of the national science and technology popularization work among workers in recent years; clarifying the future direction and tasks of the work; exchanging and summarizing the experiences in popularizing scientific and technological knowledge and learning scientific and technological knowledge; and solving the problems existing in the popularization of science.

	Liang Xi, Chairman of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, said in his opening speech: The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out that the central task now facing the people of the whole country and the working class is to strive to overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan and actively prepare for the Second Five-Year Plan. To accomplish this great task, we must have a large number of workers and managers with a high level of science and technology. However, China's science and technology level has not yet shaken off its backward state, and the scientific and technological level of the vast number of workers is far behind the needs of the country. This situation requires our science and technology workers to bravely undertake a dual historical task: on the one hand, to improve their professional level and strive to enable China's most urgently needed scientific departments to catch up with or approach the world's advanced level by the end of the Third Five-Year Plan period; on the other hand, to popularize scientific and technological knowledge to the broad masses of working people, especially the vast number of workers, so that China has sufficient construction forces. This situation also requires the vast number of workers to actively advance towards science and technology and strive to improve their scientific and technological level.

	Wu Yuzhang, Honorary Chairman of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, delivered a congratulatory speech to the conference. He said that the convening of this conference shows that our workers are very enthusiastic about science and technology and are demanding to actively advance towards science. He encouraged the workers to learn scientific and technological knowledge with great courage, great determination, and a down-to-earth attitude. He believes that they will definitely be able to learn well.

	Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, made a report at the conference. He pointed out that at present, due to the rapid development of factories and mines and the large increase in new workers, many experienced veteran technicians have been transferred to support new factories and mines or have been promoted to administrative management cadres, so the average technical level of workers has relatively declined, which is extremely disproportionate to objective needs. At the same time, China is building many new large enterprises equipped with advanced technology; the existing ones must also be gradually technologically transformed, so workers, technicians, and engineers need to learn and master modern science and technology. Lai Ruoyu said that there are various ways to improve the scientific and technological level of the working masses, and widely carrying out science popularization work is one of the important ways. Its advantage is that it is flexible and diverse, and its target audience is relatively broad. Lai Ruoyu put forward three opinions on improving the science and technology popularization work among workers: resolutely strengthen the organizational leadership and ideological leadership of this work; strengthen the cooperation between trade union organizations and science and technology popularization associations; and in the work, we must rely on activists and give full play to their leading role, bridge role, and backbone role.

    全国职工科学技术普及工作积极分子大会开幕
    进一步动员职工向科学技术进军
    新华社29日讯　全国第一次职工科学技术普及工作积极分子大会今天下午在北京开幕。这次大会是中华全国总工会和中华全国科学技术普及协会为了进一步动员全国职工向科学技术进军而联合召开的。
    出席大会的正式代表有一千多人，他们是由二十五个省、自治区和三个直辖市的工会和科普协会以及解放军总政治部和农业、文化、铁道等部门通过召开大会评选和邀请的方式产生出来的，包括科学技术宣传工作者、组织工作者和学习者三方面的积极分子。代表中有大学教授、讲师、助教、中学教员、科学研究人员、工程师、技术人员、医务工作者、文化工作者、工会工作者、工人、厂矿、机关的职员和解放军官兵；其中有著名的科学家、工程师和厂矿先进工作者。参加大会的还有四十九个列席代表。
    大会预定举行六天，检阅几年来全国职工科学技术普及工作的成就；明确今后工作的方针和任务；交流和总结普及科学技术知识和学习科学技术知识的经验；解决普及科学工作中存在的问题。
    全国科普协会主席梁希在大会开幕词中说：中共第八次全国代表大会指出，现在摆在全国人民和工人阶级面前的中心任务，就是争取超额完成第一个五年计划和积极准备第二个五年计划。要完成这个伟大任务，必须有大量的具有较高的科学技术水平的工人和管理人员，然而我国的科学技术水平还没有摆脱落后状态，广大职工的科学技术水平远远落后于国家的需要，这种情况，要求我国科学技术工作者们勇敢地担当起双重的历史任务：一方面提高自己的业务水平，争取在第三个五年计划期末使我国最急需的科学部门能够赶上或接近世界先进水平；另一方面，把科学技术知识普及给广大劳动人民，尤其是广大职工，使我国拥有足够的建设力量，这种情况也要求广大职工积极向科学技术进军，努力提高自己的科学技术水平。
    全国科普协会名誉主席吴玉章向大会致祝词。他说，这次大会的召开，表示了我们职工对科学技术是非常热心的，是要求积极向科学进军的。他勉励职工们要用很大勇气、很大决心和脚踏实地的态度来学习科学技术知识，他相信这样是一定能学好的。
    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚在大会上作了报告。他指出，目前由于厂矿企业的迅速发展，新工人的大量增加，很多有经验的老技工调去支援新的厂矿企业，或被提拔为行政管理干部，因而工人的平均技术等级有相对下降的趋势，这种情况同客观需要极不相称；同时，我国正在建设着许多新的、以先进技术装备起来的大企业；原有的也要逐步进行技术改造，所以工人、技术人员和工程师需要学习与掌握现代科学技术。赖若愚说，提高职工群众的科学技术水平的方式是多种多样的，广泛开展科学普及工作，就是其中重要方式之一，它的好处是灵活多样、对象比较广泛。赖若愚对改进职工科学技术普及工作提出了三点意见：切实加强对这一工作的组织领导和思想领导；加强工会组织同科普协会组织的合作；工作中必须依靠积极分子，充分发挥他们的带头作用、桥梁作用和骨干作用。
