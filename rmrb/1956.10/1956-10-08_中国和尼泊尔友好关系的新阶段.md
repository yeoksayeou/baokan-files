    The recent developments in the friendly relations between China and Nepal are truly exciting. Following the signing of the "Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Nepal for Maintaining Friendly Relations and on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet Region of China and Nepal," the Prime Minister of Nepal, Tanka Prasad Acharya, paid a friendly visit to our country. He brought with him the profound friendship of eight million Nepalese people and was warmly welcomed by the people of our country. During this friendly visit, Prime Minister Acharya held talks with our Premier Zhou Enlai and issued a joint statement. At the same time, the China-Nepal Friendship Association was also established during his visit to our country. All this indicates that the friendly relations between China and Nepal have entered a new stage.
    China and Nepal have a history of peaceful coexistence and friendly exchanges for over a thousand years, but never before has there been such a close and solid friendship as today. The beginning of a new stage in the friendly relations between China and Nepal is a product of the new era and a result of the active implementation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence by both countries. As pointed out in the joint statement by the two governments, the development of our friendly relations proves that peaceful coexistence is not only necessary but also possible. Many facts prove that as long as any two countries sincerely implement these principles, they will be able to coexist peacefully, and their friendly relations will continue to develop. The reason why some countries still cannot live in harmony and tensions have arisen between them is that the ruling groups of certain countries are unwilling to implement, or even stubbornly undermine, these principles.
    Prime Minister of Nepal's friendly visit and the joint statement issued by the two governments have not only deepened our mutual understanding, trust, and friendship but also contributed to the solidarity of Asian and African countries and the cause of world peace. The joint statement solemnly declares that our two countries will continue to strengthen economic, trade, and cultural relations in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and implement the newly signed agreement on maintaining friendly relations between the two countries. At the same time, based on these principles, the two governments will continue to contribute to the consolidation of peace in Asia and Africa and the world, and to the promotion of unity and cooperation among Asian and African countries. Obviously, the people of China and Nepal will work tirelessly to realize these solemn provisions announced in the joint statement because the realization of these provisions is fully in line with the fundamental interests of our two peoples and is the common demand and desire of our two peoples.
    The good-neighborly relations between China and Nepal, just like the good-neighborly relations between China and India, not only conform to the common aspirations of the two peoples but also have a positive impact on Asian peace. The Himalayas are not a barrier separating China, India, and Nepal, but a bond linking the friendship of our three countries. As Prime Minister Acharya said, "I believe that the friendship between Nepal, China, and India will last as long as the Himalayas." Let us wish that the friendship between China, India, and Nepal will last forever!

    中国和尼泊尔友好关系的新阶段
    最近期间中国和尼泊尔友好关系的发展，使人感到非常兴奋。在两国签订了“中华人民共和国和尼泊尔王国保持友好关系以及关于中国西藏地方和尼泊尔之间的通商和交通的协定”之后，尼泊尔首相坦卡·普拉萨德·阿查里雅到我国进行了友好访问。他带来八百万尼泊尔人民的深厚友谊，受到我国人民的热烈欢迎。阿查里雅首相在这次友好访问中，同我国周恩来总理举行了会谈，并发表了联合声明。同时，在他访问我国期间，中国尼泊尔友好协会也宣告成立。这一切，说明中国和尼泊尔两国的友好关系已经开始了一个新的阶段。
    中国和尼泊尔有着一千多年和平相处和友好往来的历史，但是过去任何时候都不会有像今天这样密切和巩固的友谊。中国和尼泊尔友好关系新阶段的开始，是新时代的产物，是两国积极执行和平共处五项原则的结果。正同两国政府联合声明中所指出，我们的友好关系的发展证明了和平共处不但是必要的，而且是可能的。许多事实证明，任何两个国家只要真诚地执行这些原则，那么它们就能够和平相处，它们的友好关系就会不断发展。而在目前若干国家之间所以还不能和睦相处，在它们之间形成了紧张的局面，这是由于某些国家的统治集团不愿意执行甚至执拗地破坏这些原则的缘故。
    尼泊尔首相这次友好访问和两国政府发表的联合声明，不仅加深了我们两国的相互了解、信任和友谊，而且有助于亚非国家的团结和世界的和平事业。联合声明庄严地宣布，我们两国今后要根据和平共处五项原则，继续加强两国之间经济、贸易和文化关系，并贯彻执行最近签订的关于两国保持友好关系的新协定。同时，根据这个原则，两国政府将继续为巩固亚非和世界的和平，为促进亚非国家的团结和合作而作出贡献。显然，中国和尼泊尔两国人民都将为实现联合声明中所宣布的这些庄严的规定而努力不懈，因为实现这些规定，是完全符合我们两国人民的根本利益的，是我们两国人民的共同要求和愿望。
    中国和尼泊尔的睦邻关系，正同中国和印度的睦邻关系一样，不但符合两国人民的共同愿望，而且对亚洲和平产生了良好的影响。喜马拉雅山不是隔离中国、印度、尼泊尔的壁障，而是联结我们三国的友谊的纽带。阿查里雅首相说得好：“我相信尼泊尔、中国、印度三国的友谊将像喜马拉雅山一样长久。”让我们预祝中国、印度、尼泊尔三国的友谊永世长存！
