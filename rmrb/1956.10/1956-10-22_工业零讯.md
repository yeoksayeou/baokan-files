    Tractor Factory May Start Production Early
    Some machines in the repair shop of the auxiliary workshop of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant started running ahead of schedule on the morning of October 12.
    The repair shop of the auxiliary workshop is one of the fourteen workshops scheduled to start production this year. Its task is to repair the plant's production equipment and manufacture some of the equipment needed for the production of tractors. Its early start shortens the time distance for the tractor factory to produce tractors.
  "Prestressed Reinforced Concrete" Components
    The Hexi Prefabricated Factory of the North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, began to accept the task of trial-manufacturing "prestressed reinforced concrete" components in July this year. The first component they trial-manufactured—an eighteen-meter "prestressed reinforced concrete" combined roof truss beam—has recently completed its process. After actual pressure testing, the load exceeded the design standard.
      "Prestressed concrete" components are a latest technological achievement. It can replace metal structure factory roof trusses. Calculated on only one factory building project, it can save the country 2,200 tons of steel.
      Mechanization Level of Caijiagang Coal Mine Improved
    The Huainan Caijiagang Coal Mine has now been transformed from a small mine into a medium-sized production capacity mine.
    After this reconstruction, the level of mechanization of Caijiagang Coal Mine has been greatly improved. From coal mining to transportation, all use machinery, and more than twice as much coal can be produced each year. (Wu Rongjiang)
    Lightweight Mountain Plow
    Kunming Machine Factory recently successfully trial-produced a No. 16 mountain plow. It will produce 12,000 of these mountain plows before the end of this year. It is small and light, weighing no more than fifteen kilograms. After trial cultivation, it proves that the quality and soil turning performance are very good. The general deep plowing reaches six inches, and the maximum tensile force reaches 450 kilograms, exceeding the standard of 150 kilograms. (Lu Yuting)

    拖拉机厂可能提前生产
    第一拖拉机制造厂辅助工场机修车间的部分机器在10月12日上午提前开始转动。
    辅助工场机修车间是今年计划开工生产的十四个车间中的一个。它的任务是：修理全厂的生产设备和制造生产拖拉机时需用的部分设备。它的及早投入生产，缩短了拖拉机厂生产出拖拉机来的时间距离。
  “预应力钢筋混凝土”构件
    建筑工程部华北太原工程局河西预制厂，从今年7月份开始接受试制“预应力钢筋混凝土”构件的任务。他们试制的第一种构件——十八公尺的“预应力钢筋混凝土”组合屋架梁的工序最近已经完成。经过实际试压鉴定，荷重超过了设计标准。
      “预应力混凝土”构件，是一项最新的技术成就。它可以代替金属结构的厂房屋架。仅在一个厂房工程上计算，就可以给国家节约二千二百吨钢材。蔡家岗煤矿机械化程度提高
    淮南蔡家岗煤矿，现在已经由一个小型矿井，改建成了中型生产能力的矿井。
    经过这次改建，蔡家岗煤矿机械化程度大大提高，从采煤到运输都使用机械，每年可多产一倍以上的煤炭。　（吴荣江）
    轻巧的山地犁
    昆明市机器厂，最近试制成功了一种十六号的山地犁，今年年底前将生产一万二千部这种山地犁，小而轻巧，重量不超过十五公斤。试耕后证明质量、翻土性能都很好，一般深耕到六寸，耐拉力最高达到四百五十公斤，超过标准一百五十公斤的规定。（卢雨亭）
