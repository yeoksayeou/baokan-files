Xinhua News Agency, October 6th: United Press reporter Peter Webb admitted on October 5th that despite the Western countries forcing the withdrawal of Western pilots working in the Suez Canal, they had failed to achieve their plot to disrupt canal navigation, and traffic on the waterway remained smooth.

The reporter said in a dispatch from Port Said that since President Nasser nationalized the old canal company on July 26th, two thousand eight hundred and sixty-five ships had passed through the 101-mile waterway. However, it is estimated that only 40% of them paid the tolls to Egypt. The remaining 60% of ships—mainly British and French ships—still pay the tolls into the old company's accounts in London and Paris.

The reporter pointed out that some shipping personnel welcomed the new Egyptian management methods because the flexibility of the convoys (convoy times varied daily in the first few weeks) allowed their ships to join the convoy long after the scheduled departure time. Under the old company's management, departure times were rigid, and ships arriving even one minute after the deadline had to wait for the next convoy, waiting for many hours.

The reporter said that according to information obtained from the Egyptian authorities, the maintenance work on the canal is progressing satisfactorily, and dredgers can be seen daily dredging the continuously accumulating silt.

    美国记者承认苏伊士运河畅通无阻  航运人员对埃及管理办法表示欢迎
    据新华社6日讯　合众社记者彼得·韦伯10月5日承认，尽管西方国家强迫撤走了在苏伊士运河工作的西方引水员，它们并没有能够实现破坏运河航行的阴谋，这条水道上的交通仍然畅通。
    这个记者在从塞得港发出的一则电讯中说，自从纳赛尔总统7月26日把旧运河公司收归国有以来，已经有二千八百六十五艘船通过了这条长一百零一英里的水道。但是，估计其中只有40％把通行费交给了埃及。其余的60％的船只——主要是英国和法国的船只——仍然把通行费交到旧公司在伦敦和巴黎的账目上。
    记者指出，有些航运人员对新的埃及管理办法表示欢迎，因为船队的时间有伸缩性（船队的时间在头几个星期每天都不一样），使得他们的船只在预定的开航时间过后很久还可以参加船队，在旧公司的管理下，开航的时间是死板的，船只在截止时间过后一分钟到达也得等下一个船队，等候许多小时。
    记者说，从埃及当局那里所了解到的情况看来，运河上的保养工作正在令人满意地进展着，每天可以看到疏浚机在挖掘不断积聚的淤泥。
