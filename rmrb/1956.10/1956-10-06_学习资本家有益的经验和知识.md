Learning from Capitalists' Beneficial Experiences and Knowledge

Liu Huinong, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his political report: "Many capitalist personnel are rich in management experience and technical knowledge. They understand the specific needs of consumers, are familiar with market conditions, and are good at careful calculation. Therefore, in addition to educating them, our staff must also earnestly learn from them and inherit their beneficial experiences and knowledge as a social legacy." This instruction is of extreme importance for improving our work.

In order to pursue profits, capitalists have indeed accumulated some knowledge and experience in business management during fierce commercial competition, and many of these things are beneficial. For example, one of their business tricks is to be good at investigating and studying the needs of the masses and doing business for different people. However, our state-owned commerce is doing very poorly in this regard, often treating the needs of the people as an average number with little or no difference. For example, the commercial departments in Wuhan simply allocate seafood according to the population ratio of Hankou, Wuchang, Hanyang, and Qingshan. In fact, the seafood business in Wuhan is mainly concentrated in Houhualou Street in Hankou. There are more people who eat seafood in this area, and everyone has been accustomed to buying it there for a long time. As a result, the seafood in this area is often out of stock, while the seafood in the areas where workers and farmers live in Qingshan and Hanyang is often overstocked. After understanding this situation, the capitalist Wang Hesheng suggested transferring the seafood from Qingshan and Hanyang back, and the problem was solved.

In order to pursue high market prices, capitalists always actively try to order goods in advance and speed up transportation. Although we cannot raise prices arbitrarily, we should learn from them the practice of ordering goods before the season and improving transportation. We often save a little freight, and we do not ship goods that are not enough for a trainload. As a result, people living in Wuhan find it difficult to eat fresh goods. Capitalists send special personnel to accompany the transportation of batch goods, and they plan to organize processing along the way. In the past, when capitalists transported Sichuan oranges, they unloaded the ship in Yichang for sorting and then transported them to Hankou. However, we focused on saving the intermediate sorting costs and did not unload the ship for sorting, resulting in a large number of oranges rotting in the cabin.

Capitalists are very good at flexibly grasping the operating principles of good goods at good prices, inferior goods at inferior prices, and damaged goods at reduced prices. However, state-owned companies manage retail prices very rigidly, resulting in some unnecessary losses. For example, cucumbers are sold for one dime a pound in the morning, and even if there are only a few damaged goods left in the evening, they must be sold for one dime a pound. Cabbage was overstocked in Wuhan this summer. Because the price set by the company could not be changed by the retail stores, they had to watch it rot and finally throw it into the Yangtze River.

We mobilize a large number of goods from all over to meet the needs of the people, but we do not pay attention to and are not good at organizing small quantities of goods like capitalists. For example, grass mats were out of stock in Wuhan this summer. The native products company sent people everywhere to purchase them, but they still could not purchase them. However, the jointly owned Xinxiang Company used its old relationships to buy more than 20,000 mats. This is of course because we lack old relationships, but more importantly, we do not value the small number of 20,000. Capitalists also pay attention to combining bulk purchases with sporadic purchases in their business. For example, Chinese medicine stores purchase from medicine stores on the one hand, and also collect them sporadically on the other hand, while pharmaceutical companies look down on small sources of goods, resulting in more and more Chinese medicines being out of stock.

Capitalists are also relatively rich in their knowledge of the varieties and quality of goods. There is a Wang Fengzuo in Wuhan who has been engaged in seafood business for many years. He can casually say forty kinds of shark fins and their origins, quality, specifications, and storage methods. He and several other people have also written a book on the 322 qualities and 886 origins of 120 kinds of seafood groceries, as well as the usage and storage methods of these seafood groceries. We do not have this kind of knowledge, and it cannot be found in existing books, but there are more than just a few capitalists who have this kind of knowledge. From this, it can be seen that it is meaningful to use the beneficial experience of capitalists to serve socialism, and it is also helpful to improve the labor enthusiasm of capitalists, transform them, and make them self-reliant laborers.

    学习资本家有益的经验和知识
    中共武汉市委书记　刘惠农
    刘少奇同志在政治报告中指出：“资方人员很多是富有管理经验和技术知识的，他们了解消费者的具体需要，熟悉市场情况，善于精打细算。因此，我们的工作人员除开向他们进行教育以外，还必须认真地向他们学习，把他们的有益的经验和知识当作一份社会遗产继承下来”。这一指示，对于改进我们的工作是有极重要的意义的。
    资本家为了追求利润，在激烈的商业竞争中确实积累了若干经营管理的知识和经验，其中有许多东西是有益的。例如，他们经营窍门之一，就是善于调查研究群众的需要，针对不同的人来做买卖。而我们的国营商业在这方面做得很差，往往把人民的需要做为一个没有差别或差别很小的平均数来对待。像武汉市的商业部门简单地按照汉口、武昌、汉阳、青山的人口比例配销海味。实际上，武汉市海味的买卖主要集中在汉口的后花楼街，这一带吃海味的人较多，长时期来大家也习惯在那里购买，于是，这一带的海味经常脱销，而青山、汉阳一带工人、农民聚居的地区的海味经常积压。资本家王鹤声了解这种情况后，建议把青山、汉阳的海味调回来，就把问题解决了。
    资本家为了追逐高昂的市场价格，总是积极设法提前订货，加快运输。我们虽然不能随便高抬物价，但是，季前订货，改善运输的做法，是应该向他们学习的。我们常为节省一点运费，不够一车皮的货就不交运，结果，住在武汉市的人很难吃到鲜货；资本家对成批货物的运输，都派有专人随行，并且有计划地在沿路组织加工。过去资本家贩运川橘，一到宜昌就卸船整理，然后再运汉口。我们却着眼节省中途整理费用而不卸船整理，结果把大批橘子烂在船舱里。
    资本家很会灵活掌握好货好价，次货次价，残货残价的经营原则。而国营公司对零售价管得很死，结果造成了一些不应有的损失。例如黄瓜，早晨卖一毛钱一斤，到傍晚剩下几条残货，也非一毛钱一斤不卖。武汉市今年夏季包菜积压，因为公司规定的价格零售店不敢更改，只好看着它烂掉，最后都扔到长江里去了。
    我们从各方面调集大量货品来满足人民的需要，但是不像资本家那样注意和善于组织小量货物。如武汉市今夏草席脱销，土产公司派人四处收购，仍然收购不到。而公私合营新祥号利用旧有关系，就买到了两万多条席子。这固然是因为咱们缺乏旧关系，但更主要的是不把二万条的小数放在眼里。资本家做生意还注意采取大宗收购与零星收购相结合的办法。例如中药店，一方面向药行批购，一方面又自己零碎收购，而药材公司则看不起小宗货源，以致脱销的中药愈来愈多。
    资本家在熟悉货物品种、质量方面的知识，也是比较丰富的。武汉有个多年经营海味的王凤祚，他能够随便说出四十种鱼翅及其产地、品质、规格和保管方法，他和另外几个人还把一百二十种海味杂货的三百二十二种品质、八百八十六个产地以及这些海味杂货的用法、保管法写成了书。这种知识不单我们没有，在已有的书上也找不到，有这种知识的资本家却不只少数几个人。由此可见，把资本家的有益的经验用来为社会主义服务是有意义的，对于提高资本家的劳动积极性，改造他们，使其成为自食其力的劳动者，也是有作用的。
