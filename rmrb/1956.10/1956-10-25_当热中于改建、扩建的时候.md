When Enthusiastic About Reconstruction and Expansion...
　　Mao Xianzhi, Liu Yi

In recent years, the industry of Lüda has recovered and developed rapidly. The mechanical industry, which could only do repairs and fittings in the past, can now manufacture locomotives, ships, precision machine tools, mining vehicles, and other complete sets of large machinery and equipment. In the chemical industry, comparing 1955 with 1949, the output of pure alkali increased nearly seven times, and the output of soda ash increased more than forty times. The city's total industrial output value (excluding individual handicrafts) in 1955 increased more than three times compared to 1949. Despite this, there is still great potential that has not been exploited. According to statistics from seven state-owned machinery factories in Lüda, the utilization rate of machine tool equipment in 1955 only reached 58.93%; the comprehensive average equipment utilization rate of 58 major products of enterprises under the Lüda Municipal Industrial Bureau only reached 48.2%, of which the building materials industry only reached 28%, and the daily necessities industry only reached 35.5%. Some important factories have not yet received the due recovery and development, and some equipment has been idle there for a long time. Even those factories that are in production have not fully utilized their production potential due to certain equipment being too old and outdated, as well as imbalances in equipment capacity and unreasonable arrangement of processes.

This year, after the Party Central Committee issued instructions on fully tapping the potential of coastal industries, many factories in Lüda have calculated the potential of their enterprises and plan to carry out reconstruction, expansion, and technical transformation of the enterprises. This is beneficial to further exploit the potential of Lüda industrial enterprises. However, some units have not distinguished which enterprises must be reconstructed and expanded; which enterprises do not need to be reconstructed and expanded; which enterprises are likely to be reconstructed and expanded; and which enterprises are impossible to be reconstructed and expanded; at the same time, they have not distinguished which enterprises should be reconstructed and expanded immediately; and which enterprises should be reconstructed and expanded in the future. Therefore, they did not consider the needs and possibilities at the same time, did not distinguish the priority and sequence of reconstruction and expansion, but wanted to do everything at once and start immediately. As a result, blind reconstruction and expansion have occurred in some units.

For example, the reconstruction and expansion of the Dalian Machine Tool Factory deserves careful consideration. This factory was merged from more than 20 small machinery factories, and the original foundation was very poor and unreasonable. Now this factory proposes to carry out a larger reconstruction and expansion. However, the site is very small. To expand, it is necessary to merge the nearby small factories, schools, and residential houses with them, and move those small factories, schools, and residents away. This caused problems. The original arrangement of the factory's workshops was unreasonable. If these newly merged factories and buildings are used for reconstruction, although the factory's production capacity will increase, the unreasonable arrangement of production workshops will still exist seriously. If you want to make future production completely reasonable, you have to abandon many original foundations, demolish old factory buildings, and build new factory buildings. Demolishing and rebuilding (the factories, schools, and residents who are moved out also have to build new houses elsewhere) costs a lot of money. In this way, it is better to build a new machine tool factory according to the design of a modern factory. Therefore, factories like this do not necessarily need to be reconstructed and expanded on a large scale, but should use the method of adding equipment locally and improving existing technical equipment, and use methods such as adjusting processing routes and improving business management to tap the potential of the enterprise.

The reconstruction and expansion plans of some factories, from the local perspective of one unit, seem necessary and reasonable. Because after reconstruction and expansion, production can be doubled. However, from the perspective of the needs of the entire national construction, it is not necessarily reasonable, or impossible. For example, the Dalian Asbestos Factory originally believed that the country was short of steel and should use a large number of cement asbestos pipes instead of steel pipes. Therefore, it planned to reconstruct and expand the existing asbestos factory according to the scale of producing one million meters of asbestos pipes per year. This desire is good. But later, after understanding, it was known that the country would build new asbestos pipe factories in the interior. In this way, the Dalian Asbestos Factory was changed to reconstruct and expand according to the requirement of producing 400,000 meters per year. The Dalian Printing and Dyeing Factory heard that it was necessary to tap the potential of coastal industries, and it was also very enthusiastic, planning to add printing machines. For the Dalian Printing and Dyeing Factory, this can add some new products. However, printed fabrics are only cost-effective when produced centrally, and it is not cost-effective for a factory to produce one or two printing machines. Therefore, it has become unreasonable for the Dalian Printing and Dyeing Factory to add printing machines.

The reconstruction and expansion of some factories are necessary and reasonable, but lack possible conditions. Because after the Party put forward the instruction to fully tap the potential of coastal industries, many factories wanted to reconstruct and expand. Currently, there are fourteen or five factories in Lüda that plan to carry out reconstruction, expansion, and technical transformation in a relatively comprehensive and systematic manner. According to preliminary statistics, more than 70 units in Lüda (including enterprises and universities, of which about 30 are industrial construction units) plan to carry out capital construction next year. Therefore, next year's capital construction investment in Lüda will increase by one time, and the floor area of civil construction will increase by nearly three times. This is not only not permitted by the country's financial, material, and technical forces, but also difficult for the strength of the region and the enterprise to cope with. Moreover, these factories all require to start reconstruction and expansion next year, but the preparations have not yet begun. It is understood that for the capital construction to be carried out in Lüda next year, only about 10% currently have design objects or have begun to design. In this case, if we are still eager to start reconstruction and expansion, a chaotic situation of designing while constructing will inevitably occur. As for situations such as work stoppages, waste, slow progress, and poor project quality, it is also difficult to avoid. Now many factories only know that they want to reconstruct and expand, but they have no idea what materials are needed and whether the country can guarantee the supply. The ordering of electromechanical equipment has also not been carried out, which makes it difficult to guarantee the timely supply of equipment next year. Take the very simple building material - red bricks - as an example, it is a big problem. Red bricks should have been produced this year to store brick blanks there (freezing in winter cannot produce), and can be used after firing in the kiln next year. However, this year there is a large shortage of red bricks in Lüda, and even the use in the fourth quarter of this year is not enough. If the civil construction tasks increase by three times next year, and no preparations have been made to expand the production of red bricks, then there will be major difficulties in the supply of red bricks next year. From the perspective of construction strength, the problem is even greater. This year, the civil construction area in Lüda is about 300,000 square meters, which is still considered to be a shortage of manpower, and more than 8,000 farmers have to be transferred from the countryside to provide support. And next year, the civil construction area will increase to nearly 1.2 million square meters according to the existing figures, and the lack of manpower is a very obvious problem. In particular, industrial construction has increased next year, and the task of mechanical and electrical installation has increased, requiring a large number of highly skilled skilled workers, and the work of training these workers has not yet begun. It can be seen that the existing manpower cannot cope with the heavy construction tasks next year.

Some people say that next year's reconstruction and expansion tasks will be heavy, and the central industrial ministries may send manpower to support them. This dependence is wrong. Because Lüda is an existing industrial city, it not only cannot transfer people from other places to support it, but also requires Lüda to export talents to support key construction in other places.

Therefore, when everyone is enthusiastic about reconstruction and expansion, it is too necessary to calmly consider the possible conditions. Only in this way can the reconstruction and expansion work be built on a reliable foundation.

Finally, it should be explained that some factories in Lüda should completely carry out reconstruction, expansion, and technical transformation. Even if the conditions for reconstruction and expansion of these factories are poor, they should actively strive for them, strive to create conditions, and prepare for them as soon as possible. Therefore, the reconstruction and expansion of these factories cannot be confused with those blind reconstruction and expansion.

    当热中于改建、扩建的时候……
    毛先智　刘义
    旅大工业在近几年来恢复和发展很快。过去只能修修配配的机械工业，现在已能制造机车、轮船、精密机床、工矿车辆以及其它成套的大型机器设备了。化学工业，拿1955年和1949年比，纯矸产量提高了将近七倍，烧矸产量提高了四十多倍。全市的工业总产值（不包括个体手工业）1955年比1949年提高了三倍多。尽管如此仍有很大潜力没发挥出来。据旅大七个国营机械工厂统计，1955年机床设备运用率仅达到58.93％；旅大市工业局所属企业五十八种主要产品综合平均设备利用率仅达到48.2％，其中建筑材料工业只达到28％，日用品工业只达到35.5％。有些重要的工厂至今还没得到应有的恢复和发展，有些设备长期闲置在那里。就是那些正在生产的工厂，也由于某些设备过于陈旧落后，以及设备能力不平衡、工序的排列不合理等缺点，生产潜力没有得到充分的发挥。
    今年，党中央发出关于充分发挥沿海工业潜力的指示以后，旅大许多工厂纷纷核算本企业的潜力，打算对企业进行改建、扩建和技术改造。这对进一步发挥旅大工业企业的潜力是有好处的。但是也有一些单位没有分清楚哪一些企业是必须改建和扩建的；哪一些企业是不需要改建和扩建的；哪一些企业是有可能改建和扩建的；哪一些企业是没有可能改建和扩建的；同时也没有分清楚哪一些企业是应该马上改建和扩建的；哪一些企业是应该在以后改建和扩建的。因而没有把需要和可能这两个方面同时联系起来加以考虑，没有分清改建、扩建的先后主次，而想百废俱举，齐头并进，马上动手。这样，在某些单位就发生盲目改建和扩建的情况。
    举例来说，大连机床厂的改建、扩建就值得慎重考虑。这个工厂是由二十多个小机械厂合并起来的，原来基础很差，也很不合理。现在这个厂提出要进行较大的改建、扩建。但是场地很小，要扩建就得把附近的小工厂、学校、居民住宅并给他们，把那些小厂子、学校、居民搬走。这样就出了问题。这个工厂原来车间的排列就不合理，如果利用这些新合并进来的厂房和建筑物进行改建，虽然工厂的生产能力会有所增加，但生产车间的排列等不合理情况仍然严重存在。如果要想使将来的生产完全合理，那就要抛弃许多原有的基础，拆掉旧的厂房，盖起新的厂房。一拆一盖（被迁出的工厂、学校、居民也要到别处新建房屋），花钱不少。这样就不如按照近代化工厂的设计，新建一个机床厂。因此，像这样的工厂就不一定作规模较大的改建、扩建，而应该用局部增添设备和改善现有技术装备的办法，用调整加工路线和改善经营管理等办法，来发挥企业的潜力。
    有些工厂的改建扩建方案，从一个单位的局部观点来看，好像是必要的，也是合理的。因为改建扩建后，生产都能成倍地提高。但是从整个国家建设的需要上来考察，就不一定合理了，或者是不可能的了。如大连石棉厂，原先认为国家钢材缺乏，应该大量利用水泥石棉管代替钢管。于是便计划把现有的石棉厂按照年产百万公尺石棉管的规模进行改建扩建。这种愿望是好的。但是后来经过了解，知道国家要在内地新建石棉管厂。这样，大连石棉厂便改为按年产四十万公尺的要求进行改建、扩建了。大连印染厂听说要发挥沿海工业的潜力，劲头也很大，打算要增加印花机。这对大连印染厂来说，可以增加一些新产品。但是印花布只有集中生产才合算，一个工厂搞一两台印花机生产是不合算的。因此大连印染厂增设印花机就成为不合理的事情了。
    有些工厂的改建和扩建，是必要的合理的，但是缺乏可能条件。因为党提出要充分发挥沿海工业潜力的指示以后，许多工厂都要改建和扩建。在旅大打算比较全面地、系统地进行改建、扩建和技术改造的，目前就有十四五个工厂。据初步统计，旅大有七十多个单位（包括企业和大专学校，其中工业建设单位约三十多个）打算在明年进行基本建设。因此明年旅大基本建设投资将要增加一倍，土建面积要增加将近三倍。这不但国家的财力、物力和技术力量不许可，就是本地区、本企业的力量也难以应付。而且这些工厂都要求在明年就动手进行改建扩建，但是各项准备工作还无头绪。据了解，明年旅大市要进行的基本建设，目前有了设计对象或者开始进行设计的仅有10％左右。在这种情况下如果仍急于开工改建、扩建，就必然会出现边设计、边施工的混乱局面。至于停工窝工，浪费大，进度慢，工程质量低劣等情况也难于避免。现在很多工厂只知道要改建、扩建，至于需要些什么材料，国家是否能保证供应，就心中无数了。机电设备的订货工作也大都没进行，这就很难保证明年设备的及时供应。就拿很简单的建筑材料——红砖来说，就是大问题。红砖本应该今年生产砖坯储备在那里（冬天结冻不能生产），明年经过烧窑后才能使用。而今年旅大红砖大量缺乏，连今年第四季度使用也很不够。如果明年土建任务增加三倍，而现在又没有进行扩大红砖生产的准备工作，那么，明年的红砖供应就会发生重大的困难。从施工力量方面来看，问题就更大了。今年旅大土建面积约三十万平方公尺，尚嫌人力不足，还得从农村调八千多农民来支援。而明年土建面积据现有的数字就将增加到将近一百二十万平方公尺，人力不够是很明显的问题。尤其明年工业性建筑增加了，机电安装任务增加了，需要大量技术很高的熟练工人，而培训这些工人的工作，现在还没开始。可见现有的人力，是无法应付明年繁重的建设任务的。
    有人说，明年改建、扩建任务重了，中央各工业部可能会派人力来支持。这种依赖情绪是不对的。因为旅大是一个原有工业城市，不但不能从外地调人来支援，而且要求旅大输出人材去支援外地的重点建设。
    因此，当大家都热中于改建、扩建的时候，冷静地考虑一下可能条件是太有必要了。只有这样才能把改建扩建工作建立在可靠的基础上。
    最后要说明，旅大有些工厂是完全应该进行改建、扩建和技术改造的。这些工厂哪怕是改建、扩建的条件差一些，也应该积极争取，努力创造条件，及早作好准备工作。因此这些工厂的改建、扩建，不能和那些盲目改建、扩建混为一谈。
