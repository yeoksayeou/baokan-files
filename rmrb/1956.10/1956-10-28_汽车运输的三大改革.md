Three Major Reforms in Automobile Transportation
Zhu Tianshun, Deputy Director of the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications

Three methods to change the current tense situation in automobile transportation: change single-vehicle transportation to trailer-towing transportation; change one-shift production to two-shift production; change on-vehicle repair to component exchange repair.

The all-round upsurge of the national economy has brought an all-round and sustained tension to highway transportation. Although the state has allocated some vehicles to areas with particularly insufficient transportation capacity, and highway transportation departments in various places have also taken some emergency measures, the phenomenon of transportation congestion is still very serious. To completely solve this problem, it is necessary to continue to increase transportation capacity. However, highway transportation departments must not passively wait for the increase in transportation capacity, but should actively improve business management and give full play to the potential of existing highway transportation tools, especially the transportation potential of professional vehicles that play a backbone role in highway transportation.

At present, the strength of automobile transportation has not been fully utilized. Only a few professional vehicles tow trailers, and a large amount of the traction force of automobiles is wasted in single-vehicle transportation. Most automobiles and repair shops still operate on a one-shift production system, the equipment utilization rate is very low, and there is a widespread phenomenon of excessively long working hours. This not only damages the health of workers but also easily causes traffic accidents. Currently, automobile repairs are mainly on-vehicle repairs. Any damage to a component requires the vehicle to be stopped for repair. The repair coefficient of automobiles is generally around 25%. Therefore, to fully exploit the transportation potential of professional vehicles, it is necessary to reform the above three aspects. With the continuous improvement of road conditions and the gradual improvement of repair technology, it is necessary to change single-vehicle transportation to trailer-towing transportation, one-shift production to two-shift production, and on-vehicle repair to component exchange repair (that is, to prepare some spare components so that the automobile will not be stopped for repair due to the damage of individual components) in a planned and step-by-step manner.

The experience of pilot projects by highway transportation departments in various places proves that: First, the implementation of trailer-towing transportation can not only give full play to the traction potential of automobiles, allowing them to carry many times more goods, but also greatly reduce automobile transportation costs. For example, the average fuel saving per ton-kilometer of automobiles towing trailers by the Fujian Provincial Highway Transportation Bureau is 43.11%, and the cost reduction is 35.3%. From the situation of many automobile repair factories manufacturing trailers, the money to buy a truck with a load capacity of three to four tons can manufacture three to four trailers of the same tonnage. The amount of steel required to manufacture trailers is very small. This shows that promoting trailer-towing transportation can increase transportation capacity with less money and less steel. In the current situation of national financial difficulties and insufficient steel, adopting this method is a better way to increase highway transportation capacity. Second, with the implementation of a two-shift production system, workers can rest on time. After Gansu, Sichuan and other provinces implemented the two-shift automobile transportation system, the unit production volume of automobiles increased by 60% to 70%. After many maintenance plants and repair plants implemented two-shift repairs, the maintenance and repair of automobiles can be done without or with less encroachment on driving time. Third, the implementation of component exchange can greatly shorten the repair time of automobiles, improve the vehicle availability coefficient, and accelerate vehicle turnover. For example, repairing a car using the on-vehicle repair method takes about eighteen days under normal circumstances. After implementing component exchange, it only takes four days. It can be seen that the implementation of the above three major reforms in automobile transportation can not only give full play to the transportation potential of automobiles but also has great national economic significance.

Of course, there are still many difficulties in carrying out the above reforms in automobile transportation in our country. In order to shorten the time of reform, highway transportation departments should take all effective measures and move forward resolutely in this direction. The following tasks should be done well at present: First, vigorously train technical workers. On the premise of ensuring quality, strive to train enough two-shift automobile drivers and assembly repair workers in the shortest possible time, and increase the manufacturing power of trailers and automobile parts. Second, improve trailer manufacturing technology to make them strong and durable, flexible in steering, and good in braking. In the case of insufficient national steel, try to use scrapped automobiles and old waste materials to manufacture trailers. In particular, we should vigorously research and manufacture wooden-structured trailers with a load capacity of less than five tons. Third, vigorously promote the advanced experience of repairing old and waste parts to solve the shortage of parts and components. In addition to conscientiously implementing the 28 pieces of old parts repair experience exhibited at the National Transportation Advanced Experience Exhibition in May this year, we should promote the advanced experience of various old parts repairs taught by the Soviet Highway Delegation. Fourth, improve the production organization of transportation and repair, try to improve the utilization rate of automobiles and trailers, reduce vehicle idling; take reasonable shift change methods to prevent the phenomenon of no one being responsible; make the various repair processes closely connected, and ensure transportation safety and repair quality.

In order to smoothly realize the three major reforms of automobile transportation, the efforts of the highway transportation department alone are not enough, and the support and assistance of relevant parties are also needed. Because the manufacture of trailers requires certain materials. At present, some automobile repair factories have the ability to manufacture trailers, but they cannot manufacture them because they cannot find the necessary materials. Therefore, it is hoped that the material distribution departments in various places can help solve them as much as possible. We hope that the First Ministry of Machine Building can organize forces to produce trailers for the highway transportation department. At present, there is a serious shortage of automobile parts. In many places, automobiles have been waiting for repairs for a long time due to the lack of automobile parts. It is hoped that the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Commerce will take effective measures to quickly change this phenomenon. Some material departments have complicated procedures for entering and leaving the cargo yard, mechanically implement the work schedule, cannot load and unload in time, and even some vehicles have just loaded and unloaded halfway, and stopped loading and unloading because it was time to get off work. There are also some who load and unload a vehicle of goods and call the car to run several places. We hope that various material departments will assist in overcoming these unreasonable phenomena, try to do a good job in transportation preparation work, and gradually improve loading and unloading equipment.

    汽车运输的三大改革
    交通部公路总局副局长　朱田顺
    改变目前汽车运输紧张状况的三大办法：变单车运输为拖带挂车运输；变一班制生产为两班制生产；变就车修理为总成互换修理。
    国民经济的全面高潮给公路运输带来了全面的持续的紧张。虽然国家已经调拨了一部分车辆给运输力量特别不足的地区，各地公路运输部门也采取了一些紧急措施，而运输阻塞现象仍很严重。要彻底解决这一问题，需要继续增加运输力量，但公路运输部门，绝不能消极地等待运力的增加，应该积极改进经营管理，充分发挥现有各种公路运输工具的潜在力量，特别要充分发挥在公路运输中起着骨干作用的专业汽车的运输潜力。
    目前，汽车运输的力量还没有得到充分的发挥，专业汽车只有少数拖带挂车，大量的汽车牵引力在单车运输中被浪费掉了。大部分汽车和修理厂，还是一班制生产，设备利用率很低，而且普遍存在着劳动时间过长的现象，这样，既损害工人身体健康，又容易造成行车事故。现在汽车的修理，主要是就车修理，任何一个总成的损坏，都要把车辆停下来待修，汽车的修理系数，一般在25％左右。因此，要充分发挥专业汽车的运输潜力，就必须针对以上三个方面进行改革，随着道路情况的不断改善和修配技术的逐步提高，有计划有步骤地变单车运输为拖带挂车运输，变一班制生产为两班制生产，变就车修理为总成互换修理（就是准备一些备用总成，使汽车不致因个别总成的损坏而停车待修）。
    各地公路运输部门试办的经验证明：第一、实行拖带挂车运输，不但可以充分发挥汽车的牵引潜力，使汽车多拉成倍的货物，而且可以大大降低汽车运输成本。如福建省公路运输局拖带挂车的汽车平均每吨公里节省汽油43.11％，降低成本35.3％。从许多汽车修理厂制造挂车的情况看，大约买一辆载重三至四吨的汽车的钱，可以制造三至四辆相同吨位的挂车。制造挂车所需要的钢材很少。这说明推行拖带挂车运输，可以用较少的钱和较少的钢材，增加较多的运输力量。在当前国家资金困难，钢材不足的情况下，采用这个办法，是增加公路运力的一个较好的途径。第二、实行双班制生产，工人可以按时作息，甘肃、四川等省实行汽车双班运输后，提高了汽车的单位生产量60％到70％。许多保养厂和修理厂实行了双班修车后，汽车的保养和修理，可以做到不占用或少占用出车时间。第三、实行总成互换，可以大大缩短汽车的修理时间，提高车辆的完好系数，加速车辆的周转。如目前用就车修理法修车，在正常情况下，大修一部车需要十八天左右，实行总成互换后，只需要四天的时间。由此可见，在汽车运输上实行上述三大改革，不仅可以充分发挥汽车的运输潜力，而且具有很大的国民经济意义。
    当然，在我国汽车运输上进行上述改革，还存在许多困难，为了缩短改革的时间，公路运输部门应该采取一切有效的措施，坚毅地朝着这个方向前进。目前主要应该做好以下几项工作：第一，大力培养和训练技术工人。要在保证质量的前提下，争取于最短的期间内训练足够的双班制的汽车司机和装配修理工，并增加挂车和汽车配件的制造力量。第二，改进挂车制造技术，做到坚固耐用、转向灵活、制动良好。在国家钢材不足的情况下，尽量利用报废汽车和旧废材料制造挂车。特别应该大力研究制造五吨以下的木结构的挂车。第三，大力推广修复旧废配件的先进经验，以解决配件和总成的不足。除了应认真推行今年5月全国交通先进经验展览会所展出的二十八件旧件修复的经验外，应该推广苏联公路代表团所传授的各项旧件修复的先进经验。第四，改进运输、修理的生产组织工作，尽量提高汽车和挂车的利用率，减少车辆的空驶；采取合理的换班方式，防止发生无人负责的现象；使各个修理工序密切衔接，并保证运输安全和修理质量。
    为了顺利实现汽车运输的三大改革，只有公路运输部门的努力是不够的，还需要有关方面的支持和帮助。因为制造挂车需要一定的材料。目前有些汽车修配厂有制造挂车的能力，只因找不到必要的材料，而不能制造。因此希望各地物资分配部门能尽量帮助解决。我们希望第一机械工业部能够组织力量为公路运输部门生产挂车。目前汽车配件严重脱销，许多地方因为缺乏汽车配件，汽车长期待修。希望第一机械工业部和商业部采取有效措施，迅速改变这一现象。有些物资部门进出货场手续繁杂，机械地执行上下班制度，不能及时装卸，甚至有的车辆刚装卸一半，因到下班时间而停止装卸。也有的装卸一车货物，叫汽车跑几个地方。我们希望各个物资部门协助克服这些不合理的现象，尽量做好运输准备工作，逐步改进装卸设备。
