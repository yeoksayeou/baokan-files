Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th - Representatives from all circles in Berlin, 1,500 people in total, held a gathering at the German State Opera House on the evening of October 6th to grandly celebrate the seventh anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic.

German Democratic Republic Prime Minister Grotewohl delivered a commemorative report at the meeting.

Grotewohl first spoke about the brilliant achievements and great progress made by the German Democratic Republic in the political, economic, and cultural fields over the past seven years. He said: The industrial level of the German Democratic Republic is rapidly improving. In the first half of this year alone, the heavy machinery manufacturing industry produced 230 newly designed machines. Technologically, they are fully comparable to the best foreign designs. With the help of the Soviet Union, the first nuclear power station of the German Democratic Republic is now under intensive design. It will be completed before 1960.

Grotewohl then said that on the basis of the development of production, the lives of the working people are constantly improving. The total wages of employees in the industrial sector have increased from 3.6 billion marks in 1949 to 11.5 billion marks this year. He pointed out that the amount of products from basic raw material industries, light industry, and the food industry put into the domestic market is increasing year by year. After the price reduction in June this year, the people's purchasing power has increased by another 900 million marks this year. Over the past seven years, the state has spent a huge sum of 63.6 billion marks on education, culture and art, and scientific departments.

Grotewohl pointed out that the achievement of all these successes would not have been possible without the active leadership of the working people in the political and economic life of the country. He said: "In connection with this, strict adherence to socialist legality is of particular significance. Safeguarding the rights of the working people must be our unshakable law."

When talking about the political situation in Germany, Grotewohl said: The reactionary policies of the West German monopoly capitalists, Junker landlords, and militarists, as well as the establishment of the West German army, have forced us to take effective defensive measures. For this purpose, we have established the National People's Army. He then said: However, while the West German ruling clique is trying its best to resist the tide of world politics and continuing the Cold War, implementing compulsory military service in West Germany, banning the German Communist Party, and persecuting all progressives, the German Democratic Republic has taken a series of measures to ease tensions and seek understanding. He pointed out that the armed forces of the German Democratic Republic have been reduced to 90,000 people.

Grotewohl then spoke about the issue of understanding between the two Germanys. He pointed out that only the unity and joint action of the working people of all Germany can stop the remilitarization of West Germany and lead to the rapprochement and understanding between the two Germanys. Grotewohl called on all democratic parties, mass organizations, and all citizens of the German Democratic Republic united under the banner of the National Front of Democratic Germany to make important contributions to the reunification of Germany with a high degree of seriousness and national responsibility. He said that the German Democratic Republic must become an increasingly strong attraction for all Germans, and it must become a shining example of a future unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany.

When talking about foreign policy, Grotewohl said: The German Democratic Republic has gained international attention and recognition. In describing the active foreign policy of the German Democratic Republic, he mentioned the friendly visit of the German government delegation to China at the end of last year, the agreement reached with the Soviet government in July this year, and the new relationship that has been established with Yugoslavia. Grotewohl also emphasized the great sympathy of the German Democratic Republic government for the anti-imperialist struggles being waged today by all nations that have suffered from colonialism in the past. He said: The freedom that has been achieved through arduous struggles like that of the Egyptian people must never be re-violated under any pretext.

German Democratic Republic President Pieck attended the celebration meeting on October 6th. Also attending the meeting were People's Chamber Chairman Dieckmann, government ministers, members of the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany, secretaries and members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations, senior generals of the National People's Army, and celebrities from all walks of life in Berlin, representatives of the working people, etc. Diplomatic envoys of various countries to Germany and representatives of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany also attended the celebration meeting.

    柏林各界集会庆祝民主德国国庆
    格罗提渥报告七年来各方面建设的成就
    号召全体公民为德国重新统一作出贡献
    新华社柏林7日电　柏林各界代表一千五百人10月6日晚上在德国国家歌剧院举行集会，隆重庆祝德意志民主共和国成立七周年。
    德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥在会上作了纪念报告。
    格罗提渥首先谈到七年来德意志民主共和国在政治、经济和文化各方面所获得的辉煌成就和巨大进步。他说：德意志民主共和国的工业水平正在迅速提高，单是在今年上半年，重型机器制造业就生产了二百三十种最新设计的机器。它们在技术上完全可以同外国最好的设计相比。在苏联帮助下，德意志民主共和国的第一座原子能发电站现在正在加紧设计中。它将在1960年以前建成。
    格罗提渥接着说，在发展生产的基础上劳动人民的生活不断地得到改善。工业部门职工的工资总额已经由1949年的三十六亿马克增加到今年的一百一十五亿马克。他指出基本原料工业、轻工业和食品工业的产品投入国内市场的数额一年比一年增加。经过今年6月的降低物价，人民的购买力在今年又提高了九亿马克。七年来，国家对教育、文化艺术、科学部门支出了六百三十六亿马克的巨款。
    格罗提渥指出：所有这些成就的获得，如果没有劳动人民对国家的政治和经济生活的领导的积极是不可能的。他说：“联系到这一点，严格遵守社会主义法制就具有特殊的意义。维护劳动人民的权利必须是我们不可动摇的法律。”
    在谈到德国政治形势的时候，格罗提渥说：西德垄断资本家、容克地主和军国主义者的反动政策以及西德军队的建立，迫使我们不得不采取有效的防御措施。为了这个目的，我们建立了国家人民军。他接着说：可是，当西德统治集团竭力抗拒世界政治的潮流和继续进行冷战、在西德实行义务兵役、禁止德国共产党、迫害所有进步人士的时候，德意志民主共和国采取了一系列缓和紧张局势和谋求谅解的措施。他指出，德意志民主共和国的武装部队已经减少到九万人。
    格罗提渥接着谈到两个德国之间的谅解问题。他指出，只有全德国劳动人民的团结一致和共同行动，才能制止西德重新军国主义化，才能导致两个德国的接近和谅解。格罗提渥号召团结在民主德国全国阵线旗帜下的所有各民主党派、群众团体和德意志民主共和国全体公民以高度的严肃性和民族责任感为德国的重新统一作出重要的贡献。他说，德意志民主共和国必须成为对全体德国人的日益强大的吸引力量，它必须成为未来的统一、爱好和平和民主的德国的光辉榜样。
    谈到外交政策的时候格罗提渥说：德意志民主共和国已经获得国际上的重视和承认。他在叙述德意志民主共和国的积极的外交政策时提到去年年底德国政府代表团到中国的友好访问，今年7月间同苏联政府达成的协议以及同南斯拉夫之间已经建立起来的新关系。格罗提渥还强调指出了德意志民主共和国政府对于过去曾经受到殖民主义压迫的各民族今天所进行的反帝国主义斗争给予巨大同情。他说：像埃及人民那样经过艰苦斗争而取得来的自由，永远不能在任何借口下重新遭到侵犯。
    德意志民主共和国总统皮克出席了10月6日的庆祝大会。参加大会的还有人民议院主席狄克曼、政府的部长们、民主德国全国阵线全国委员会委员、统一社会党中央委员会书记和政治局委员、各民主党派人民团体负责人、国家人民军高级将领和柏林市各界名流、劳动人民代表等。各国驻德外交使节和驻德苏军司令部代表也参加了庆祝大会。
