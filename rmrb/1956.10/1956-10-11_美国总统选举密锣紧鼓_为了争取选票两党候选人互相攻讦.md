Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: The US presidential campaign has entered a tense stage since it fully unfolded in mid-September, with the election date drawing nearer.

The development of the campaign so far indicates that, compelled by objective circumstances, "peace" remains the main slogan used by candidates of both parties to win votes. In a speech at Yale University on October 5, Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson attacked the Republican Party for claiming to advocate "peace," but in reality, the Republican government frequently placed the country on the "brink" of war and spent $40 billion annually on "preparing for war." Stevenson has also repeatedly raised the issue of stopping hydrogen bomb tests and conscription, which the American public eagerly desires. Democratic vice-presidential candidate Estes Kefauver used Eisenhower's refusal to stop hydrogen bomb tests and conscription to attack the Republican presidential candidate.

The Republican Party is unwilling to show weakness in the face of the Democratic Party's "peace" offensive. On the one hand, it continues to use the Korean armistice and the US's double-dealing approach on the Suez Canal issue to tout the Republican government's "peace" achievements. On the other hand, the Republican National Committee issued a statement accusing the Democratic Party of launching the Korean War during its tenure, which caused "tens of thousands of American youths to be killed, crippled, and injured." Republican vice-presidential candidate Richard Nixon also criticized Stevenson's slogan of stopping conscription as "reaching the extreme of political deception and irresponsibility."

Amidst the mutual attacks of the two parties, the US ruling group's unease about the development of the international situation is reflected. In a speech on September 27, Stevenson said, "The world's big pot is about to boil, but the Republican Party says everything is fine."

On domestic policy, the mutual attacks between the two parties are also fierce. Democrats continue to accuse the Republican government of being a "government of big business," whose attitude towards the people is like "the attitude of a big boss towards a waiter." They accuse the Republican Party's rule of bringing difficulties to American small and medium-sized enterprises, especially American farmers, and say that the "prosperity" touted by the Republican government is entirely an "illusion." Stevenson even attacked the Republican Party for using "movies, jeeps, girls, and new gadgets, etc." to sell the Eisenhower-Nixon ticket to voters once again.

The activities of the two parties' candidates are becoming increasingly intense. Republican vice-presidential candidate Nixon made a campaign "trip" to thirty-two states and returned to Washington in early October. Eisenhower then followed up with his campaign activities, and plans to go to the western agricultural areas in mid-October. According to American news agencies, Nixon's throat has become "hoarse" due to delivering approximately fifty speeches each week during his trip. After Democratic presidential and vice-presidential candidates Stevenson and Kefauver traveled together, they are now separately trying to win votes. Stevenson is also about to start activities in the western agricultural areas.

The two parties' campaigns are now in a state of equilibrium. Many American newspapers, which originally believed that Eisenhower's "popularity" would allow the Republican Party to continue its rule, have now changed their tune.

This development has caused anxiety among the originally confident Republicans. Eisenhower recently called on Republicans to turn the campaign into a "crusade" and to make "sufficiently arduous efforts." He himself will also conduct more campaign activities than originally planned.

On the other hand, the Democratic Party, having already achieved some victories in state and local elections, is now using this momentum to strengthen their position.

United Press commented that the upcoming campaign will be a "vigorous contest" to see who can "ignite hope and imagination with some new and powerful things." (Attached picture)

### 美国总统选举密锣紧鼓  为了争取选票两党候选人互相攻讦

    美国总统选举密锣紧鼓
    为了争取选票两党候选人互相攻讦
    据新华社10日讯　美国总统竞选运动自从9月中旬全面展开以来，随着选举日期日益临近，现在已经进入了紧张阶段。
    竞选运动到目前为止的发展表明，迫于客观形势，“和平”仍然是两党候选人企图用来博取选票的主要口号。民主党总统候选人史蒂文森10月5日在耶鲁大学发表的一篇演说里攻击共和党自称主张“和平”，但是实际上共和党政府经常使国家处在战争的“边缘”，并且每年花四百亿美元用来“准备战争”。史蒂文森最近还再三提出美国公众渴望实现的停止氢弹试验和征兵的主张。民主党副总统候选人克弗维尔利用艾森豪威尔拒绝停止氢弹试验和征兵一事攻击这个共和党总统候选人。
    共和党在民主党的“和平”攻势前也不肯示弱。它一方面继续利用朝鲜停战和美国在苏伊士运河问题上的两面三刀作法来标榜共和党政府的“和平”功绩，另一方面又由共和党全国委员会发表公告，指责民主党执政时期所发动的朝鲜战争使“成千上万的美国青年被打死了，残废了，受伤了”。共和党副总统候选人尼克松还抨击史蒂文森提出停止征兵的口号是“达到政治欺骗和不负责任的极点了”。
    在两党互相攻讦中间，反映出了美国统治集团对国际局势发展感到不安。史蒂文森在9月27日发表的一篇演说里说，“世界这口大锅正要沸腾，而共和党却说一切都很好”。
    在国内政策方面，两党间的相互攻击也很激烈。民主党人继续指责共和党政府是“大企业的政府”，它对人民的态度就像“大老板对侍者的态度”一样。他们指责共和党的当政给美国中小企业、特别是美国农民带来困难，并且说共和党政府所吹嘘的“繁荣”完全是“幻觉”。史蒂文森甚至攻击共和党正在用“电影、吉普车、女郎以及新玩意儿等等”再一次向选民出卖艾森豪威尔—尼克松名单。
    两党候选人的活动越来越紧张。共和党副总统候选人尼克松在三十二个州作了竞选“旅行”刚刚在10月初回到华盛顿以后，艾森豪威尔又接着开始了他的竞选活动，并且计划在10月中旬到西部农业地区。据美国通讯社报道，由于在旅行中每个星期大约发表五十篇演说，尼克松弄得喉咙“都哑了”。民主党总统和副总统候选人史蒂文森和克弗维尔在一起作了一番旅行以后，现在又分头在拉拢选票。史蒂文森也就要开始到西部农业地区活动。
    两党竞选运动现在已经处于势均力敌的状态。原来认为艾森豪威尔的“人望”会使共和党继续当政的美国许多报刊，现在有很多都改变了调子。
    这种形势的发展已经引起原来满怀自信的共和党人的焦虑。艾森豪威尔不久前号召共和党人把竞选运动变成一个“十字军运动”，并且要作出“足够艰苦的努力”。他本人也要作比原来的计划更多的竞选活动。
    另一方面，民主党由于在州和地方选举中已经取得了一些胜利，现在正在利用这个势头来加强他们的地位。
    合众社评论说，今后的竞选将是一场“有力的竞赛”，看究竟谁能够“用一些新的而有力的事情来燃起希望和想像”。（附图片）
