Xinhua News Agency, 26th. A Xinhua News Agency reporter learned from the National Cotton Production Work Conference currently being held that the preliminary estimate of this year's total national cotton output will be higher than the bumper harvest of 1955 and is expected to exceed the production target for 1957, the final year of the First Five-Year Plan.

Due to the realization of agricultural cooperation throughout the country and the strengthening of leadership by Party and government leading departments in cotton production work, the priority supply of a large number of new-style farm implements and pesticides, as well as the widespread promotion of advanced cotton planting experience from Xinjiang and other regions, not only have Shandong, Hubei, Henan, Shaanxi and other provinces seen large areas of high-yield cotton fields with yields exceeding 100 jin per mu, but also many cotton-producing provinces and regions have generally and rapidly increased unit area yields and changed the production landscape of low-yield cotton areas. For example, the unit area yields in Shaanxi, Hubei, Gansu and other provinces have increased by 20% to 49% compared with 1955. Although some cotton areas in Shandong and Henan suffered from natural disasters, the average unit area yield of the entire province still increased by more than 15% compared with 1955. In particular, Hubei Province not only increased its cotton yield per mu from 32 jin last year to more than 46 jin this year, but also greatly improved the quality of cotton. Anhui Province used to be a low-yield cotton area, but this year the province's lint cotton yield per mu increased by more than 20% compared with 1955. The average yield per mu in Nanyang Prefecture, Henan Province, this year is also more than double that of 1955. It is understood that many other low-yield cotton areas have also become large-scale high-yield typical examples.

Between summer and autumn this year, major cotton-producing areas such as Hebei and Jiangsu suffered continuous rain and typhoon attacks, which had a huge impact on cotton growth, and a large number of cotton fields were abandoned. However, due to the widespread development of the struggle against natural disasters by agricultural cooperatives in these regions and the universal strengthening of post-disaster cotton field management, the losses from the disasters were reduced.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi Province achieved a bumper harvest of major agricultural crops, grain and cotton, and both have exceeded the production targets for the final year of the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. According to preliminary statistics, the average yield per mu of more than 31 million mu of autumn grain crops in the province reached more than 153 jin (excluding soybeans), an increase of more than 39 jin compared with last year. Among them, there are many large-area high-yield fields and high-yield fields, with the highest paddy field corn averaging more than 2,000 jin per mu. The total grain output of the province can reach about 11.5 billion jin, exceeding the 1957 planned target by about 1 billion jin. The average yield per mu of more than 4.7 million mu of cotton fields in the province is expected to reach more than 52 jin of lint cotton, an increase of 50% compared with last year. The average yield per mu of 530,000 mu of large-area high-yield cotton fields in 11 counties including Dali, Chang'an and Xianyang is likely to reach 110 jin of lint cotton. Many agricultural cooperatives and production teams with a yield of 100 jin of lint cotton per mu have emerged in various places, and many low-yield cotton areas have become high-yield cotton areas. The total cotton output of the province will reach more than 2.5 million dan, an increase of more than 1 million dan compared with last year, exceeding the 1957 planned target.

    今年全国棉花总产量将超过去年
    预计可以超额完成1957年的生产指标
    陕西省粮棉丰收，棉花增产一百多万担
    新华社26日讯　新华社记者从正在举行的全国棉产工作会议上获悉，今年全国棉花的总产量初步预计，将比丰收的1955年增产，并且可以超额完成第一个五年计划最后一年1957年的生产指标。
    由于全国各地农业合作化的实现和党、政领导部门加强了对棉花生产工作的领导，大量新式农具和农药的优先供应，以及普遍推广新疆和其他地区先进植棉经验的结果，不仅使山东、湖北、河南、陕西等省出现了成片亩产一百斤以上的大面积丰产棉田，同时也使许多产棉省、区普遍迅速提高了单位面积产量和改变了低产棉区的生产面貌。如陕西、湖北、甘肃等省的单位面积产量，都比1955年提高了20％到49％，山东、河南部分棉区虽然遭到自然灾害，但是全省平均单位面积产量仍比1955年提高15％以上。特别是湖北省，不但每亩棉花产量由去年的三十二斤提高到今年的四十六斤以上，而且棉花质量也有很大提高。安徽省过去是低产棉区，但是今年全省每亩皮棉产量比1955年提高了20％多。河南省南阳专区今年全专区每亩的平均产量也相等于1955年的一倍以上。据了解其他还有很多低产棉区都一跃而为大面积丰产典型。
    今年夏、秋之间，河北、江苏等主要产棉区遭受连绵霪雨和台风侵袭，棉花生长受到巨大影响，并且大量棉田废弃。但是，由于这些地区的农业合作社广泛开展了对自然灾害的斗争，普遍加强了灾后的棉田管理工作，从而减轻了受灾的损失。
    据新华社讯　陕西省主要农作物粮食和棉花丰收，都提前超额完成了第一个五年计划最后一年的产量指标。据初步统计，全省三千一百多万亩秋粮作物，每亩平均产量达到一百五十三斤多（大豆除外），比去年提高三十九斤多。其中有许多大面积丰产田和高额丰产田，最高的水田玉米平均每亩达到二千多斤。全省粮食总产量可以达到一百一十五亿斤左右，超过1957年计划指标十亿斤左右。全省四百七十多万亩棉田，每亩平均产量预计可能达到皮棉五十二斤以上，比去年提高50％。大荔、长安、咸阳等十一个县的五十三万亩大面积丰产棉田，每亩平均产量可能达到皮棉一百一十斤。各地出现了许多亩产百斤皮棉的农业社和生产队，不少低产棉区变成了高产棉区。全省棉花总产量将达到二百五十万担以上，比去年提高一百多万担，超额完成1957年计划指标。
