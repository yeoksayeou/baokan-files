Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 29th. Southern purple sugarcane, which typically grows in the south, is growing very well in Tianjin this year and is being harvested.

This sugarcane variety was brought back from Jiangsu last year by Yue Hongfu, a member of the Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tianjin. The agricultural cooperative then trial-planted it on more than one mu of land, and the harvest was very good. Based on the trial planting experience, the Hongxing Cooperative planted more than thirteen mu this year and obtained a bumper harvest, with each mu yielding seven to eight thousand sugarcane plants.

According to the appraisal results of the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy, this sugarcane grown in the north is comparable to that produced in the south in terms of the height of each plant and the length of each section.

Next year, the Hongxing Cooperative plans to expand the sugarcane planting area to eighty mu.

    南方紫皮甘蔗在天津生长良好
    新华社天津29日电　一向生长在南方的紫皮甘蔗，今年在天津生长的很好，正在收获。
    这种甘蔗种，是天津市红星农业生产合作社社员岳洪福去年从江苏带回来的。以后经农业社试种了一亩多地，收成很好。红星社根据试种的经验，今年又种植了十三亩多地，获得丰收，每亩可以收七、八千棵甘蔗。
    据天津市农林水利局鉴定结果，生长在北方的这种甘蔗和南方产的比较，每棵的高度和每节的长度等方面都差不多。
    明年，红星社计划把甘蔗的种植面积扩大到八十亩。
