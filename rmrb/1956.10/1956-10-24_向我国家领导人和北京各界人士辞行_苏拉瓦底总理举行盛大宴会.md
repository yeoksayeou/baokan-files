Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd—Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, and Premier Zhou Enlai attended the grand banquet held by Prime Minister Suhrawardy this evening.

This banquet was held by Prime Minister Suhrawardy to bid farewell to Chinese national leaders and people from all walks of life in Beijing before he leaves Beijing to visit various places.

Amidst the welcoming music, Prime Minister Suhrawardy, accompanied by Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, and Premier Zhou Enlai, entered the banquet hall of the Beijing Hotel. At this moment, all the more than eight hundred Chinese and foreign guests gathered here stood up and warmly applauded them.

Chairman Mao Zedong raised his glass at the banquet and said:

	“I propose:

	To the prosperity and happiness of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,

	To the friendship between the people of China and Pakistan, to the solidarity of Asian countries and world peace,

	To the health of His Excellency President Mirza of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, cheers!"

As Chairman Mao Zedong finished speaking, the band played the Pakistani national anthem.

Prime Minister Suhrawardy said at the beginning of the banquet that on the eve of his departure from Beijing, he took this opportunity to express his gratitude to the Chinese people. He praised the construction of the Chinese people and China's long-standing cultural and artistic traditions. He said: You have built a huge building, that is the common will of the people, the will to live gloriously and happily among all the countries in the world. Everywhere I have found determination, serious effort, hope and enthusiasm, and confidence in the future.

Prime Minister Suhrawardy said that in serious life, you have not forgotten art and beauty, which is really great. China has already made great and remarkable progress, but it is destined to have even greater progress. He said that in his conversations with Chinese leaders, what impressed him the most was that Chinese leaders realized that the work they had done was not enough, and that for them, there was still a long way to go ahead of China. He said that with such leaders, a country can expect greater achievements.

Prime Minister Suhrawardy finally proposed a toast to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong. As he finished speaking, the band played the Chinese national anthem.

During the banquet, Prime Minister Suhrawardy repeatedly stood up to toast the health of Marshal Zhu De, the health of Premier Zhou Enlai, and the lasting friendship between China and Pakistan.

Premier Zhou Enlai said in his speech that although we have different views on certain international issues, we recognize that we have many common points between us. These common points are sufficient to form the basis for consolidating and developing the friendly relations between our two countries, and we both have the common desire to develop friendly relations. He pointed out that the joint statement signed by the two prime ministers today has well affirmed this common point and expressed our common desire. He said that Prime Minister Suhrawardy's visit to China has increased mutual understanding between China and Pakistan and will definitely help the further development of friendship between China and Pakistan.

Premier Zhou Enlai also stated that he was very happy to accept the invitation from Prime Minister Suhrawardy on behalf of the Pakistani government to visit Pakistan, and was preparing to visit in the near future.

    新华社23日讯　毛泽东主席、朱德副主席和周恩来总理今晚应邀出席了苏拉瓦底总理举行的盛大的宴会。
    这个宴会是苏拉瓦底总理为他行将离开北京去各地参观前，向中国国家领导人和北京市各界人士辞行而举行的。
    在欢迎曲声中，苏拉瓦底总理同毛泽东主席、朱德副主席和周恩来总理一起进入北京饭店的宴会厅。这时，欢聚在这里的八百多位中外客人全体起立，向他们热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    毛泽东主席在宴会上举杯说：
      “我提议：
    为巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国的繁荣幸福，
    为中国巴基斯坦两国人民友好，为亚洲各国的团结和世界和平，
    为巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国米尔札总统阁下的健康，干杯！”

    苏拉瓦底总理说，在严肃的生活中，你们没有忘掉艺术和美，这的确太好了。中国已经有了伟大的和了不起的进步，但是它注定还会有更大的进步。他说，他同中国领袖们的交谈中，给他印象最深的，就是中国领袖们认识到已做的工作还是不够的，对他们来说，中国的面前还有一段很长的路程。他说，有了这样的领袖，一个国家是可以期望有更大的成就的。

    周恩来总理还表示，他很高兴地接受苏拉瓦底总理代表巴基斯坦政府邀请他去巴基斯坦访问的邀请，并且准备在短期内前往访问。
