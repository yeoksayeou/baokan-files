There are Brewing and Sugar-Making Majors

    Your newspaper's October 10th edition, page two, in the article "Does This Count as Integrating Study with Application," stated: "Taking the brewing and sugar-making industries as examples, currently, no universities or specialized schools have brewing or sugar-making majors..." This is not in line with the facts. Currently, Nanjing Institute of Technology, South China Institute of Technology, Chengdu Institute of Technology, Sichuan Luzhou Chemical Industry School, the Ministry of Light Industry's Sugar and Wine Industry School, and other institutions all have sugar-making, fermentation, and other majors or departments. Therefore, it can only be said: "Currently, the number of brewing and sugar-making majors is relatively small, and they cannot meet the requirements of sugar and wine factories. To meet the needs of industrial production, it is of course very necessary for the state to assign some university graduates with roughly similar majors to sugar and wine factories."

    有酿酒专业和制糖专业
    你报10月10日第二版“这算不算学用一致”一文中载：“就以酿酒、制糖工业来说，目前在各大学、专业学校里，都没有酿酒专业、制糖专业……”这是与事实不符的。目前南京工学院、华南工学院、成都工学院、四川泸州化工学校、轻工业部糖酒工业学校等院校，都分别设有制糖、发酵等专业或系科。因此，只能说：“目前酿酒、制糖专业设置较少，不能满足糖厂、酒厂的要求，为了满足工业生产的需要，国家把一部分专业大致相近的大学毕业生派到糖厂、酒厂里去，当然就是很必要的了。”
