    I Love Balinese Dance
    Dai Ailian
    In 1955, when I accompanied the Chinese cultural delegation to Indonesia, the "Island of Poetry," Bali, its picturesque natural scenery immediately attracted me. However, what fascinated and impressed me the most was Balinese dance and music. I am delighted that our people have the opportunity to appreciate this world-renowned dance, and I believe that the Balinese art troupe's friendly visit and performances in our country will be a great success.
    Just as the religion of the Balinese people is a combination of Hinduism and Buddhism, Balinese dance also has similarities to the dances of India and Myanmar. Their eye and head movements, and the smiles on their faces, are very similar to Indian dance. The angles of the body, postures, and the way of walking, especially as seen in the "Honeybee Dance," are very similar to Myanmar dance. However, the swaying of their hands with all ten fingers horizontally to both sides, and the shooting, meteor-like glances, are unique to Balinese dancers. I have rarely seen such expressive gestures and eyes. Balinese dance and the accompanying music blend together perfectly, as if every dance movement is immersed in the music. If we look closely at the performers' faces, you will interestingly discover that the performers' eyes sometimes open very wide, with a sweet smile on their lips, but in an instant, they become very serious. Their eyes change so cleverly with the rhythm of the music, it is truly amazing.
    This time, the Balinese art troupe has brought seven types of dances to our country, each with its own characteristics. The Legong Keraton dance is a court dance. Compared with other modern dances, its movements are delicate and its expressions are subtle. The dancers wear golden crowns with two flowers inserted, and a long chest ornament hangs down to their feet. The Kebyar dance is a more modern dance. The movements are larger, appearing very relaxed and lively. This dance has two forms: sitting and standing. The male dancers sit and pull up the corners of their "sarong" (skirt), squatting and dancing rapidly, making the beautiful skirt flutter wonderfully. The female dancers, however, dress up as men to perform the standing version of this dance. There are many types of Baris dance. When portraying heroic figures, the performers wear hats made of many small seashells, with colorful ribbons attached to the long-sleeved garments, and a sword is carried on their back. The masked dance is also a type of Baris dance, with people wearing different masks to express different character personalities. The Kecak dance is a very ancient dance. Two thousand years ago, when Bali did not yet have percussion instruments, people created this dance that uses human voices for accompaniment. This "human voice orchestra," with over a hundred people, has pure, harmonious, and rhythmic singing, which is truly unique and interesting. The Bamboo dance is a dance accompanied by bamboo instruments. It is a new type of lyrical dance created in 1946, during the Indonesian people's struggle against Japanese imperialism, to comfort the guerrillas. The movements are simple, relaxed, and cheerful. Now, it has become a popular folk dance. In this dance, when a woman touches a man with a fan, the man must dance along with the woman. The Joged Bumbung dance is a collective dance that Balinese youth usually love. It is widely popular among the people, like our Yangko dance. The young people sing folk songs and dance happily. Balinese dances are very rich and diverse, but we can distinguish their different types from the performers' hats, costumes, and music.
    Every member of the art troupe is an excellent Balinese dancer. Ni Luh Cawan is a petite, amateur dancer with the unique elegance of an oriental woman. She is warmly welcomed by audiences from both the East and the West. Like any outstanding dancer, Ni Luh Cawan's dance skills are superb and her emotions are full. The movements of her entire body reach a high degree of harmony and unity. She dances so naturally and comfortably; every posture of hers is like an excellent sculpture; one movement connects to another, with no trace of connection. Her wonderful dance, combined with the rare "Gamelan" music, is like a stream flowing quietly through a brook; like a poet gently reciting poetry; like a series of beautiful pictures appearing before the audience. I Ba Oga is an excellent performer of the sitting-style Kebyar dance. This dance has rapid and agile movements; because it is performed sitting or squatting, it particularly requires flexibility of the body. I Ba Oga's healthy posture, exquisite hand gestures, and sparkling eyes deeply touch the hearts of the audience, leaving an unforgettable impression. He vividly creates the handsome and resolute image of the hero, Balawang. Like Mrs. Cawan, he performs so beautifully, making the dance and music combine so closely; when you see what is expressed in the dance, you will also feel it from the music; what you hear from the music, you will also see in the dance.
    I cannot introduce the wonderful performances of so many excellent Balinese dancers one by one. I just want to tell you, dear friends: "I love Balinese dance." (Attached picture)

    我爱峇厘舞
    戴爱莲
    1955年，我随中国访问印度尼西亚文化代表团去到“诗之岛”峇厘时，它那风景如画的大自然顿时把我吸引住了；然而，最使我迷恋和难忘的，还是峇厘的舞蹈和音乐。我欣幸我国人民能有机会欣赏这种举世闻名的舞蹈，我相信峇厘艺术友好访问团在我国的访问演出，一定能获得巨大的成功。
    正像峇厘岛人信奉的宗教是印度教和佛教的结合一样，峇厘舞蹈和印度、缅甸的舞蹈也有相似的地方。他们舞蹈时，眼睛和头部的动作、面上的微笑和印度舞蹈很相像；身体的角度、姿态、走路的方式，特别是在“蜜蜂舞”中所见到的，又和缅甸舞蹈极近似。但是，他们双手十指向两边横着的摆动，和流星般转动的眼神，却是峇厘舞蹈演员所特有的。我很少见到这样富有表现力的手势和眼睛。峇厘舞蹈和伴奏音乐的乳水交融，好像每一个舞蹈动作都浸在音乐中了。如果我们仔细看一看表演者的脸部，你会很有趣地发现：表演者的眼睛时而睁得很大，嘴角露着甜蜜的微笑，一瞬间却变得非常严肃；他们的眼睛跟随音乐的节奏变化得这样巧妙，真是令人惊异。
    这一次峇厘艺术友好访问团带到我国来的有七种舞蹈，每一种都有自己的特点。勒刚·格拉敦舞是一种宫廷舞蹈，和其他现代舞比较起来，动作细致，表情含蓄。舞蹈者头戴插着两枝花的金色花冠，一块长的胸饰垂到脚前。格比阿舞是比较近代的舞蹈。动作较大，显得很轻松、活泼。这种舞蹈有坐着和立着跳的两种。坐着跳的是男子，他左手拉起“沙龙”的裙角，半蹲着急速地舞起来，美丽的裙子飘舞得漂亮极了。立着跳这种舞的是女子，却是装扮成男子来跳的。峇厘士舞有很多种，表现英雄人物时，表演者戴着用许多小蚌壳做的帽子，在长袖的衣服上，有一条一条的五彩飘带，背上背着一把宝剑。面具舞跳的是峇厘士舞，戴着不同面具的人表现出不同的人物性格。格楂克舞是一种很古老的舞蹈。两千年以前，当峇厘还没有打击乐器时，人们创造了这种利用人声伴和的舞蹈。人数多到一百多人的这种“人声乐队”，歌声纯朴、和谐，富有节奏感，真是别有风趣。竹筒舞是一种用竹子作乐器伴奏的舞蹈。它是1946年印度尼西亚人民在和日本帝国主义斗争时期，为慰问游击队而创作的一种新型的抒情舞蹈：动作简朴、轻松愉快。现在，它已成为普遍流传的民间舞蹈。这种舞蹈当女的用扇子碰到一个男的时，那个男的就要跟着女的一同跳起来。常艾尔舞是峇厘青年平时喜爱的集体舞，它像我们的秧歌舞一样在民间广泛流传。青年们唱着民歌就高高兴兴地跳着。峇厘舞蹈非常丰富多样，但是我们从表演者的帽饰、服装和音乐能够分辨出它们的不同种类。
    艺术团的每一个成员都是峇厘舞的优秀演员。尼·鲁·楂宛是一位个子不高，有着东方女人特有的典雅风貌的业余舞蹈家。受到东西方观众的热烈欢迎。和任何杰出的舞蹈家一样，尼·路·楂宛的舞蹈技巧娴熟、感情饱满。她全身的动作达到了高度的和谐统一。她舞得那么自然、舒畅；她的每一个姿态都像一具出色的雕塑；一个动作连接一个动作，一点也看不出衔接的痕迹。她的美妙的舞蹈和那少有的“嘎木兰”音乐配合一起，像流水静静地流过小溪；像诗人轻轻地朗诵着诗篇；像一幅一幅美丽的图画出现在观众眼前。伊·巴·奥加是盘坐式的格比阿派的优秀演员，这种舞蹈的动作急速、敏捷；因为是坐着或者半蹲着来表演的，特别要求身子的灵活。伊·巴·奥加的健美的姿态，精巧的手语，闪闪有光的眼神，深深地打动观众的心弦，给人留下难忘的印象。他鲜明地创造了巴拉王英俊、刚毅的形象。他和楂宛夫人一样，表演得那样美妙，使舞蹈和音乐结合得那么紧密；当你看到舞蹈中所表现的东西，你也会从音乐中感受到它；你从音乐中听到了什么，也会在舞蹈中见到它。
    我无法一一介绍这么多优秀的峇厘舞蹈家的美妙的演技。我只想告诉你们，亲爱的朋友：“我爱峇厘舞。”（附图片）
