Our country has more than 200,000 folk professional artists. Some form troupes and performing groups, while others perform sporadically in cities and villages. They are a very large artistic force.

Since liberation, under the leadership and help of local governments, and through various social reforms and opera reforms, this force has made great progress politically and ideologically, improved its artistic skills, improved its business management, and generally improved the lives of the majority of artists. They have played a significant role in meeting the cultural needs of the people. However, in the past two or three years, a phenomenon worthy of serious attention has emerged: the repertoire of many troupes and artists has become increasingly scarce, the quality of art cannot be improved quickly, and attendance rates have declined. Although the number of performances has increased, income remains low, and many artists face significant financial difficulties. For example, more than half of the 102 folk professional troupes originally in Shanghai are facing economic hardship. One famous actor earns only a little more than ten yuan a month, and some artists are suffering from poverty and illness, unable to make a living.

Why has this phenomenon occurred? There are naturally various social and historical reasons, but mainly it is due to the lack of an overall concept of the national cultural undertaking on the part of cultural departments, which only focus on a few state-sponsored artistic performance groups and neglect the vast folk art force. They despise national artistic heritage, folk art, and folk artists, and there are some crude practices in opera reform. They have adopted a bureaucratic attitude of indifference towards the hardships of folk artists. Therefore, all walks of life have generally received proper arrangements, but this folk art force alone seems like an unloved child, still unable to get the attention, care, and leadership it deserves. In addition, some cadres in certain places even bully and insult folk artists, creating difficulties and crudely interfering with their performance activities, which further aggravates the difficulties of the folk art force in their work and lives.

It must be recognized that folk professional troupes and other folk art performance groups, as well as folk professional artists, are a valuable treasure of our motherland's art and an important part of our entire cultural undertaking. Some folk artists still have many bad ideological styles because they were influenced by the old society, but the vast majority are diligent laborers and artists. They have inherited the national artistic tradition, accumulated rich artistic performance experience and skills, and have a close connection with the broad masses of the people. Compared to state-sponsored artistic performance groups, their numbers are much larger and their strength is much greater. If they receive correct leadership, they can more widely and deeply reach the people, enabling them to receive education and entertainment. Only by fully valuing this artistic force, strengthening leadership and arrangements for them, helping them improve their ideological awareness and artistic quality, and giving full play to their enthusiasm and strengths, can we better inherit and promote the artistic heritage of the motherland, promote the prosperity and development of our country's artistic undertaking, and meet the people's growing need for cultural life. It is extremely wrong to despise folk artists and folk art, to consider them feudal and backward, and to discriminate against, exclude, and attack them. This erroneous thinking and practice will cause damage to the motherland's artistic undertaking and must be corrected in a timely manner.

In our country, compared to other tasks, the work for folk art performance groups and folk artists has lagged behind. Now many artists are experiencing financial difficulties, which has created a negative impact on society. This situation must be changed immediately. Local governments, especially the cultural departments of the government, should earnestly strengthen their leadership and arrangements for them, and help them solve the difficulties in their lives and work. In this work, we should adopt a combination of relief subsidies and active arrangements, and combine promoting the self-reliance and mutual assistance of artists with the necessary subsidies from the government. That is to say, we must overcome the current difficulties and make long-term plans; we must take care of individual interests and pay attention to national interests, and we must make these two aspects well integrated. Paying attention to only one aspect while ignoring the other will either fail to alleviate the current urgent living difficulties of the artists, or fail to fundamentally solve the artists' long-term future problems.

First of all, emergency measures should be taken to provide relief subsidies to artists who are indeed in very difficult living conditions, so that they can afford to eat, clothe themselves, and maintain a minimum standard of living. Whether they are opera troupes or Quyi, acrobatics, puppet shows, shadow plays, song and dance groups, etc., whether they are artists in professional art performance groups or scattered professional artists, whether they are actors or staff, whether they are employed or newly unemployed, as long as they are indeed in difficult living conditions, they should be given relief. But we must also grasp the key points, and give special care to the main actors whose income is not high but whose family burden is too heavy, to the old artists who have made contributions to art but have now lost their ability to work and have no one to support them, and to the families whose lives are in serious difficulty due to birth, old age, illness, and death. Do not adopt egalitarian methods, giving the same amount of relief funds regardless of whether there are difficulties or how great the difficulties are. For this reason, it is necessary to conduct some necessary typical investigations to be well-informed, and to carry out relief work in a led manner through the mass line approach. The relief methods should be simple and easy to implement, avoiding unnecessary cumbersome procedures and levels, in order to quickly achieve practical results.

At the same time, the cultural departments of local governments should establish fixed contacts with folk professional art performance groups and folk artists, understand their situation, listen to their opinions, and guide their work, and never ignore them. We must promote them to enrich and expand their performance programs. Some traditional programs left over from history, although they do not have direct political education functions, can provide the audience with proper entertainment. As long as there are no serious toxins, they should all be allowed to be performed. Some, although they have certain toxins, but as long as they are slightly modified and reorganized, there is not much harm, and they should also be allowed to be performed after modification and reorganization. For newly created and newly rehearsed programs, more active encouragement should be given and less negative criticism should be made. We must help them solve the difficulties in performance (for example, the difficulties of costumes, props, and performance venues). Various conveniences should be given to troupes and artists on tour, and they should be assisted and guided in doing a good job in publicity, promotion, and audience organization, and grassroots cadres and the masses should be persuaded and educated not to crudely prohibit and interfere with their performances. We must lead them to gradually and cautiously carry out necessary organizational adjustments. However, this adjustment must be voluntary on the part of the troupes and artists, and truly conducive to improving the quality of art and developing the artistic undertaking. Therefore, there must be sufficient preparation in advance, and there should be practical arrangements for the lives of all actors and staff. At present, it is only appropriate to select troupes with mature conditions for trial implementation to create experience, and not to engage in large-scale comprehensive efforts, so as to avoid confusion. We must properly settle old artists with skills or experience, and promote them to take apprentices and cultivate young generations. In short, we must take all effective measures to help them overcome difficulties, so as to better give play to the enthusiasm of folk artists and make greater contributions to the country and the people.

### 重视民间艺人

    重视民间艺人
    我国共有民间职业艺人二十多万人，有的组成剧团和班社演出，有的在广大城市和乡村进行零散活动。他们是一支极大的艺术队伍。
    这支队伍，解放以来，在各地政府的领导和帮助之下，经过各种社会改革和戏曲改革，政治上思想上进步很大，艺术业务有了提高，经营管理有了改进，广大艺人的生活一般地也有所改善，他们在满足人民的文化生活的需要上起了很大的作用。但是，近两三年出现了一种值得严重注意的现象，就是：不少剧团和艺人演唱节目日益贫乏，艺术质量不能很快地提高，上座率下降，虽然增加演出场次，收入仍然不多，许多艺人生活十分困难。例如，上海原有的一百零二个民间职业剧团，就有半数以上经济困难，有一个著名演员一个月只分到十多块钱，有些艺人贫病交迫，无以为生。
    为什么会产生这种现象的呢？这自然有种种社会历史原因，但主要地是由于文化部门缺乏对于国家文化事业的整体观念，只看到少数国家举办的艺术表演团体，不注意广大的民间艺术队伍；轻视民族艺术遗产、民间艺术和民间艺人，在戏曲改革中存在着某些粗暴的作法；对于民间艺人的生活疾苦采取了漠不关心的官僚主义的态度。因此，各行各业一般地都已得到了妥善的安排，而唯独这支民间艺术队伍好像没有娘的孩子，至今得不到应有的关注、照顾和领导。此外，某些地方的少数干部竟还有欺凌和侮辱民间艺人、对于他们的演出活动加以刁难和粗暴干涉的情形，这就更加加重了民间艺术队伍工作上、生活上的困难。
    必须认识：民间职业剧团和其他民间艺术表演团体以及民间职业艺人，是我们祖国艺术的宝贵财富，是我国整个文化事业的重要组成部分。民间艺人因为受到旧社会的影响，有些人还有许多不好的思想作风，但绝大多数都是勤勤恳恳的劳动者和艺术家，他们继承了民族的艺术传统，积累了丰富的艺术表演经验和技巧，同广大人民群众有着血肉的联系。比之国家举办的艺术表演团体，他们的人数要多得多，力量要大得多，如果得到正确的领导，他们更能广泛地深入到人民群众中间，使人民得到教育和娱乐。只有充分地重视这支艺术队伍，加强对于他们的领导和安排，帮助他们提高思想觉悟和提高艺术质量，发挥他们的积极性和特长，才能更好地继承和发扬祖国的艺术遗产，繁荣和发展我国的艺术事业，满足人民日益增长的文化生活的需要。轻视民间艺人和民间艺术，认为他们封建、落后，对他们歧视、排斥和打击，是极端错误的。这种错误的想法和作法，将使祖国的艺术事业遭到损失，必须及时地纠正。
    在我们的国家中，比起其他各项工作来，对于民间艺术表演团体和民间艺人的工作已经落后了一步。现在许多艺人生活困难，在社会上造成了不好影响。必须立即改变这种状况。各地政府，特别是政府的文化部门，应该切实地加强对于他们的领导和安排，帮助他们解决生活上和工作上的困难。在这项工作中，应该采取救济补助和积极安排相结合，推动艺人自力更生、互相帮助和政府的必要的补助相结合的方针。就是说，既要克服当前的困难，又要作长期打算；既要照顾个人利益，又要注意国家利益，并且要使这两方面都能很好地结合起来。只注意一方面，而忽视另一方面，就会或者使得艺人当前紧迫的生活困难不能和缓，或者使得艺人今后长远的出路问题得不到根本解决。
    首先，应该采取紧急措施，对于生活确实十分困难的艺人进行救济性的补助，使他们吃得上饭，穿得上衣服，能够维持最低限度的生活。不论是戏曲团体或曲艺、杂技、木偶、皮影、歌舞等班社，不论职业艺术表演团体的艺人或零散活动的职业艺人，不论是演员或职员，不论是在业的或新近失业的，只要生活确实困难，都应该加以救济。但又要掌握重点，对于收入不多而家庭负担过重的主要演员，在艺术上有过贡献但现在失去工作能力而又无人奉养的老艺人，以及家庭因有生、老、病、死等情而致生活陷于严重困难的人，应该特别予以照顾。不要采取平均主义办法，不问有无困难或困难大小，一律发给同样的救济款项。为此，就要作些必要的典型调查，作到心中有数，并且有领导地通过群众路线的方式进行救济工作。救济办法应当简便易行，避免不必要的繁琐的手续和层次，以便迅速地取得实效。
    同时，各地政府文化部门应该同民间职业艺术表演团体和民间艺人建立固定的联系，了解他们的情况，听取他们的意见，指导他们的工作，决不要对他们置之不理。要推动他们丰富和扩大上演节目。历史上遗留下来的传统节目，有的虽然没有直接的政治教育作用，但是能使观众得到正当的娱乐，只要没有严重的毒素，应该一律允许演出。有的虽然有某些毒素，但只要稍加修改整理，就没有多大害处，也应该允许在修改整理后演出。对于新创作和新排练的节目，应多作积极的鼓励，少作消极的指责。要帮助他们解决演出上的困难（例如，服装道具和演出场所的困难），对于巡回演出的剧团和艺人应该给以各种便利条件，协助和指导他们做好宣传、推广和组织观众的工作，并且说服教育基层干部和群众不要粗暴地禁止和干涉他们的演出。要领导他们逐步地谨慎地进行必要的组织上的调整。但是这种调整，必须出于剧团和艺人的自愿，真正有利于艺术质量的提高和艺术事业的发展，因此，事先要有充分的准备，并且应该对于所有演员和职员的生活都有切实的安排。目前，只宜选择条件成熟的剧团试办，创造经验，不要全面大搞，以免发生混乱。要妥善地安置有技术或有经验的老艺人，推动他们带徒弟，培养年轻后代。总之，要采取一切有效措施，帮助他们克服困难，以便更好地发挥民间艺人的积极性，对国家和人民作出更大的贡献。
