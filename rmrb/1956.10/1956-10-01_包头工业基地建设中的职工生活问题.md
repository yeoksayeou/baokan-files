Speech by Comrade Su Qianyi, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

I would like to say a few words about the living problems of workers in the construction of the Baotou Industrial Base.

Our country's First Five-Year Plan determined that an industrial base centered on the iron and steel industry would be established in Baotou. Workers from all over the country responded to the Party's call and came to the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, not shirking difficulties. The city's population has increased from 150,000 in 1953 to 300,000, including 100,000 workers.

In the past three years, enormous work has been carried out. After resource exploration, preparations have been made for the mining of iron ore, coal mines, metallurgical solvents, and refractory materials. The sites for the iron and steel complex and two large machinery factories have been selected, and urban planning and construction have been carried out. Design data has been collected to ensure the requirements of the design work. Railways, highways, power supply, water supply, and building materials mining and processing plants, as local industries serving basic construction, have either been put into mass production or are already in use, while others are under construction.

Two modern machinery factories have already started construction and are engaged in intensive production preparation. Various conditions for the formal construction of the Baotou Iron and Steel Company are also basically in place. In short, thanks to the conscious and creative labor of all workers and the assistance of Soviet experts over the past three years, great achievements have been made in Baotou's construction.

　　　　First, do a good job in wage work

However, because we failed to solve the problems in the workers' lives in a timely manner, this has seriously affected their enthusiasm. This year, nearly 1,000 people have left Baotou. The first is the wage problem. According to a survey by the construction company, before the wage reform, due to the abolition of regional allowances, changes in living conditions, and increased living expenses, actual income decreased by about 10% to 20%. For example, for a worker with a family of six, various expenses increased by 20% to 23% when moving from the Northeast to Baotou, and by 15% to 20% when moving from Beijing to Baotou. Workers in production plants are paid on a piece-rate basis. After coming to Baotou, they only receive basic wages because production has not yet started, and bonuses are also gone. In addition, the lack of housing means that family members cannot come to Baotou, and separation increases living expenses. Workers from the south have to increase their expenses for winter clothing and heating, and the increase in living expenses is even greater. Although wage reform has been carried out, many problems still exist.

In order to mobilize the vast number of workers to actively participate in the construction of new industrial bases, especially in the industrial construction of minority areas, the wage problem must first be reasonably resolved. We should estimate the various difficulties in labor and living conditions in minority areas and new industrial bases, accurately calculate the changes in living expenses, analyze the differences between the basic construction process and formal production, and take appropriate measures to ensure that actual wages do not decrease.

　　Gradually arrange more appropriate working and living conditions

Furthermore, urban construction and various supply and service efforts are far behind the needs of the increasing population. For example, there are few commercial outlets, few varieties, poor quality, and high prices. Workers complain that "Baotou is a good place, but you can't spend your money." There is a shortage of primary schools, and children cannot go to school. Workers say "We've eliminated illiteracy among the old, but created illiteracy among the young." During holidays, there is a lack of entertainment venues. Young workers are dissatisfied, saying "There are no tickets for dancing, you can't get a basketball, there's nowhere to go, so you just have to sleep." Other things like medical treatment, sewing, bathing, hair cutting, and transportation are all very difficult. In addition, industrial basic construction units have no bonuses and no enterprise funds. Many enterprise welfare facilities are expected to be established after the factories are built.

We must recognize that basic construction is a necessary process of production, and it is a difficult process. Necessary welfare facilities must keep pace accordingly. In places like Baotou, everything is starting from scratch. The basic construction work of the iron and steel complex will take more than ten years of arduous process. A large construction team should be gathered here, and we should try our best to overcome various difficulties and gradually arrange more appropriate working and living conditions. We cannot wait until the factories are built and production is underway to engage in welfare, nor can we cope with long-term needs with temporary facilities. This will not only fail to achieve the goal of saving, but will also create unreasonable and uneconomical situations. This is not a violation of the principle of "production first, welfare later," nor is it a violation of the principle of improving workers' lives on the basis of developing production. This is precisely to give play to the workers' enthusiasm, for production, and for the construction of the Baotou Industrial Base.

　　　　Baotou's basic construction major investment
　　　　It is recommended that the central government allocate funds through unified budget

Finally, regarding the investment in basic construction, the urban construction and other local undertakings in Baotou are all newly built, so the investment in basic construction is relatively large. In the past, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Government has strongly supported the construction of Baotou, but urban construction, material and cultural supply work still lag far behind the development of the scale of basic construction and the needs of the increasing population, which has affected the relationship between the Party and the masses. Therefore, from the perspective of development, it is impossible for Inner Mongolia to completely solve the basic construction investment of various local undertakings in the future. For example, for the basic construction funds of the entire region in 1957, the Inner Mongolia Planning Commission suggested 150 million yuan, while Baotou City initially proposed a request for 130 million yuan for various basic construction appropriations in 1957. If Baotou's requirements are guaranteed, the basic construction appropriations for the entire region will be greatly reduced. From the long-term and national development perspective, the construction of Baotou is a major measure to change the unreasonable distribution of industry in our country and promote the economic and cultural development of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. However, from the current perspective, a contradiction has arisen between key construction and the agricultural and pastoral construction of the autonomous region in terms of investment issues. Therefore, it is recommended that the central government allocate funds through a unified budget for major basic construction investment projects, and the local government should vigorously support the construction of Baotou mainly in developing the region's industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry and other undertakings.

### 包头工业基地建设中的职工生活问题

    包头工业基地建设中的职工生活问题
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会书记　苏谦益同志的发言
    我就包头工业基地建设中的职工生活问题说点意见。
    我国第一个五年计划确定在包头建立以钢铁工业为中心的工业基地。全国各地的职工响应了党的号召，不避艰难来到了内蒙古草原。全市从一九五三年的十五万人口，已增到三十万人，其中职工十万人。
    三年多来，进行了巨大的工作。经过资源勘探，做好了铁矿、煤矿、冶金溶剂、耐火材料等开采准备工作。选定了钢铁联合企业以及两个大型机械厂的厂址，同时进行了城市规划和建设工作，搜集设计资料，保证了设计工作的要求。铁路、公路、供电、供水、建筑材料的开采厂、加工厂为基本建设服务的地方工业，有的已大量投入生产或已供使用，有的正在建设。
    两个现代化的机械厂已经开工建设，并进行着紧张的生产准备工作，包头钢铁公司正式建厂的各种条件也基本具备。总之，经过三年多来全体职工的自觉的创造性的劳动和苏联专家的帮助，包头的建设工作取得了巨大的成绩。
            首先要做好工资工作
    但是因为我们过去对职工生活方面存在的问题未及时解决，这就严重地影响了他们的积极性，今年有将近一千人离开了包头。首先是工资问题。据建筑公司的调查，在工资改革以前由于取消了地区津贴，生活条件改变，生活费用增大，实际收入降低了百分之十到百分之二十左右。比如一个六口之家的职工由东北到包头各项消费增加百分之二十至百分之二十三，由北京到包头也增加百分之十五到百分之二十。生产厂的工人是计件工资，来包后因尚未生产所得的只是基本工资，而且奖金也没有了，加以房屋缺乏，家属不能来包头，两地分居也增加了生活费用。从南方来的职工要增加冬装和防寒取暖的费用，生活费用提高更多。虽然经过工资改革，但现在仍然存在不少问题。
    为了动员广大职工积极参加新工业基地的建设，特别是在少数民族地区的工业建设。首先必须合理的解决工资问题。应当估计到少数民族地区和新建工业基地的劳动和生活条件的各种困难，确实地计算生活费用的变化，分析基本建设过程中与正式生产的不同情况，采取适当措施保证实际工资不要下降。
      逐渐安排较为适当的工作和生活条件
    再就是城市建设，各种供应服务工作大大赶不上人口增加的需要。如商业门市少，品种少，质量差，价格高，职工们反映“包头地方好，有钱化不了”。缺少小学校，儿童不能上学，职工们说“扫了老文盲，出了小文盲”。休假日缺乏娱乐场所，青年职工们不满的说“跳舞没有票，打球抢不到，那也没处去，只好睡大觉”。其他如治病、缝衣、洗澡、理发、坐车都是十分困难的。还有工业基本建设单位没有奖金，没有企业基金，许多企业福利设施寄托在建起工厂后再搞。
    我们必须认识基本建设是生产的必经过程，而且是艰巨的过程，必要的福利设施必须相应的赶上。像包头这样的地方基本上是平地起家，一切是从头做起，像钢铁联合企业的基本建设工作要经过十年多的艰巨过程，在这里要集结很大的建设队伍，应当尽可能克服各种困难，逐渐安排较为适当的工作和生活条件，不能等到工厂建起来进行生产以后再搞福利，也不能以临时性的设施应付长时期的需要，这样不但不能达到节约的目的，反而会造成不合理和不合算的状况。这不是违反了先生产后福利的原则，也不是违反了在发展生产的基础上改善职工生活的道理，这正是为了发挥工人的积极性，为了生产，为了建设包头工业基地。
          包头的基本建设主要投资
          建议由中央统一预算拨款
    最后是关于基本建设的投资，包头的城市建设与其他地方事业都是新建，因此基本建设投资较多。过去内蒙古自治区政府曾以大力支援包头建设，但城市建设，物资文化供应工作仍大大赶不上基本建设规模的发展和人口增加的需要，影响了党与群众的关系。所以从发展看，今后完全由内蒙古解决地方各项事业的基本建设投资实不可能。如1957年全区基本建设款内蒙古计委建议为一亿五千万元，而包头市1957年初步提出各项基建拨款要求是一亿三千万元，若保证了包头的要求，就会大大减少全区的基本建设拨款。从长远的和全国的发展看，包头的建设是改变我国工业分布不合理状态和促进内蒙古自治区经济、文化发展的重大措施，但从目前看就在投资问题上发生了重点建设和自治区农牧建设的矛盾，因此建议基本建设投资主要项目应由中央统一预算拨款，地方主要在发展全区工、农、牧、林等事业上大力支援包头的建设。
