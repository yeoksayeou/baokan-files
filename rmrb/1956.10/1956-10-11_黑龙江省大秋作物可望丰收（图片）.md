Heilongjiang Province's non-disaster areas' 5.7 million hectares of autumn crops, such as corn, soybeans, sorghum, and millet, are showing a bumper harvest scene. If there are no early frost disasters before the autumn harvest, the province's total grain output may reach 9 million tons, an increase of 800,000 tons compared to last year.

Currently, agricultural cooperatives throughout the province are concentrating their efforts on making preparations in advance to increase production, ensure harvests, and promote the early maturity of crops. These pictures introduce the situation of the Hongqi Agricultural Cooperative in Tailai County.

    黑龙江省大秋作物可望丰收
    黑龙江省的非灾地区五百七十万公顷玉米、大豆、高粱、谷子等大秋作物呈现一片丰收景象。如果在秋收前没有早霜冻灾，全省粮食总产量可能达到九百万吨，将比去年多产八十万吨。
    现在，全省各个农业社正集中力量，提前做好增产保收和促使庄稼早熟的各项工作。这几张图片是介绍泰来县红旗农业社的情况。

    黑龙江省主要粮食作物高粱生长良好。这是红旗农业社的干部在田间检查高粱的成熟情形。
    今年的大豆比往年长得更好，生产队长于合抽检了一棵，在这棵上就结了一百三十个豆荚。
    新收的早玉米，棒子大、颗粒满，预计每公顷的最高产量将达一万斤。
    红旗农业社今年试种了二十公顷甜菜，预计每公顷可产四万斤，含糖率达到16％。
