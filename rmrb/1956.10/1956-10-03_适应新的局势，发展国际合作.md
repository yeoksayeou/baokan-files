    Adapting to the New Situation and Developing International Cooperation
    Johnson, Dean of Canterbury, England
    The world is slowly, but irresistibly, moving towards international peace and coexistence. And this pace is accelerating.
    I dare to assert this, and repeatedly assert this, despite the menacing presence of military bases and armed forces, the continued threat of atomic and hydrogen bombs, the occasional disputes over oil or vested interests, and the persistent, intermittent resistance to demands for human rights.
    Senator George, the famous American advocate of peaceful coexistence, who influenced President Eisenhower's policy in this regard, once said: "Unless the world trend changes, war with Russia may occur within three years."
    I may agree with this. But what is coming is the world trend, not war. And the world trend will change.
    Of course, there are still many dangers, and the peace movement needs to remain vigilant. Scientists must continue to warn of the dangers to mankind caused by poisoning the atmosphere, and all people must continue to unite in calling not only for the abolition of nuclear weapons tests but also for the complete elimination of all weapons of mass destruction.
    However, the dawn of lasting peace is already in sight.
    If any peace-lover still has doubts and concerns, then he would do well to review the history of the world socialist movement. The initial armed intervention wars failed. Mr. Churchill's efforts to "kill the hen before the chicks spread all over Europe" failed. Hitler's fascism failed. America's Cold War failed. The expansion of armaments failed. The threats of nuclear war in Korea and Vietnam failed.
    The common people have spoken.
    The united will of mankind has triumphed.
    Ten years ago, Mr. Churchill announced the start of the Cold War against the Soviet Union in Fulton. He felt that the West was strong enough to disregard and dominate the East.
    This May, his speech in Aachen: "Russia must participate in true European unity," shocked Adenauer and all the reactionaries in the world. This method can more easily solve the reunification of Germany and all such problems than the method of confrontation with mutual suspicion and hostility.
    Where does this change come from?
    Churchill is a realist. He felt the pressure of world opinion and yielded to it. He saw that today's world is different from the world of Fulton. He may not like this new era, but he admits that a new era has arrived and dares to face the fact of the new era.
    What are these facts?
    First, the great strides and achievements of the entire socialist world, headed by Russia, and now magnified a hundredfold by the participation of China. The economic achievements of socialism are undeniable. Under the socialist system, the national income of the Soviet Union has increased fourteenfold, and industrial production has increased twentyfold, while in the same period the capitalist world has only increased twofold.
    The same is true of socialist education, where the Soviet Union has now implemented universal education up to the age of seventeen and has given two million students education of a university standard. And in all matters of nuclear energy, the Soviet Union has caught up with the Western world, and even surpassed them.
    This struggle and competition is no longer a military struggle. When Mr. Lloyd said: "Today, Russia's overwhelming power is no longer of a military nature. This power includes a large number of technicians, craftsmen, teachers, entrepreneurs and other experts," he spoke very truthfully, perhaps even more accurately than he himself realized.
    Yes, these are the things that have shown the cunning Mr. Churchill that we have entered a new era.
    However, some other things, even more important things, have tilted the situation even further in this direction.
    China has joined the socialist world. China has stood up. A new China, a creative China, a China with 600 million people, a China with rich mineral resources and almost unlimited energy in its great rivers, a China with endless potential, is striding forward in industry, agriculture, and culture. And it is a China that has always been, and still is, a staunch advocate of peace and international friendship.
    Now, India has also joined in, and together with the entire Eastern world is seeking coexistence and cooperation. Dr. Chandra Lal Nala of India said in his Bose Memorial Lecture Collection: "In life, mutual assistance and cooperation are far more powerful factors than conflict."
    Mr. Nehru's Five Principles and the Bandung Conference have emphasized what should be emphasized. The East has taken the lead in moving towards peaceful coexistence and cooperation.
    No country in the Eastern world has done more in this regard than China. During my trip to China in these past few weeks, I have felt more and more not only that China is on the road to becoming, along with the Soviet Union, the largest industrial country in the world, but also that China, together with its great ally, is becoming the leader in the world in the struggle for peace and peaceful coexistence.
    China's fair treatment of its 35 million minority nationalities, its efforts not to exclude or conquer them but to raise them to the same level as itself, these all show most surely China's sincere intention to seek a truly cooperative world.
    I see more clearly than before how much China and my own country need each other in terms of trade between the two countries, but it is only because of the current embargo that trade has stagnated.
    The embargo must be lifted. China can move faster on the road to peace and prosperity if we ship large quantities of trucks, cars, riverboats, and all the good machinery that we can manufacture and that China so desperately needs to its various ports, then China will be able to raise the lives of its people to the necessary higher level more quickly.
    And after the embargo is lifted, we will be able to allay all fears of unemployment among our people. We will see a stable market with open doors.
    We will gain and see the lasting friendship of a great nation, the fear of war will disappear, we will be able to reduce our armaments to a minimum, and together with China we will embark on the road to prosperity and affluence with unprecedented enthusiasm and joy.
    Let Britain, like China, stand up and cut the ropes that bind the trading hands. Let Britain join hands with China in sincere cooperation and restore in a noble way the title it once enjoyed. Let it once again become a truly Great Britain.

    适应新的局势，发展国际合作
    英国坎特伯雷教长　约翰逊
    世界在缓慢地、但是不可抗拒地走向国际和平和共处。而且这种步伐正在加快。
    我敢这样断言，并一再这样断言，尽管森然林立着军事基地和武装部队，原子弹和氢弹还在威胁人们，在石油或一些既得利益上仍不时引起纷争，断断续续地极力在抗拒争取人权的要求。
    参议员乔治，美国著名的和平共处主张者，一个在这方面影响艾森豪威尔总统的政策的人，曾说道：“除非世界潮流发生改变，否则三年之内可能同俄国发生战争。”
    我可能同意这话。但是，要到来的乃是世界潮流，而不是战争。而世界潮流将会改变。
    当然，现在仍然有很多的危险，和平运动需要永远保持警惕。科学家必须继续提出警告，指出毒化空气造成的对人类的危险，所有的人仍必须一致发出呼声，不仅要求取消核子武器试验，还要求彻底废除一切大模规屠杀的武器。
    不过持久和平的曙光已经在望。
    如果有那一个和平爱好者还有所怀疑和顾虑的话，那么他最好回顾一下世界社会主义运动的历史。初期的武装干涉战争失败了。丘吉尔先生想要在“小鸡遍及整个欧洲之前就先杀死老母鸡”的努力失败了。希特勒的法西斯主义失败了。美国的冷战失败了。扩充军备失败了。在朝鲜和越南进行核子战争的威吓失败了。
    普通人民说话了。
    人类的一致的意志胜利了。
    十年以前，丘吉尔先生在富尔敦宣布对苏联的冷战开始了。他觉得西方已经强大到可以漠视和统治东方。
    今年5月，他在亚琛的讲话：“在真正的欧洲统一中必须有俄国的参加。”这震动了阿登纳和世界的一切反动分子。这个方法比起那种彼此怀着猜疑和敌视的对垒的方法来，能更容易解决德国的重新统一和所有这类问题。
    这个变化从何而来的呢？
    丘吉尔是一个现实主义者。他感觉到世界舆论的压力，并向它屈服了。他看出今天的世界已不同于当年富尔敦的世界。他可能不喜欢这个新纪元，但是他承认，一个新纪元已经到来，并敢于正视新纪元这一事实。
    这些事实是什么呢？
    首先是以俄国为首、现在又由于中国的参加而百倍壮大的整个社会主义世界的巨大迈进和成就。社会主义的经济成就已是无可争辩的。在社会主义制度下，苏联的国民收入已增加到十四倍，工业生产增加到二十倍，而在同一时期资本主义世界只增加到两倍。
    社会主义的教育的情况也是这样，现在苏联已实施普及教育直到十七岁，并已使两百万学生受到大学标准的教育。而在所有核子能的事情上苏联已赶上了西方世界，而且还超过了它们。
    这个斗争和竞赛已不再是军事斗争。当劳埃德先生说到：“今天俄国的压倒的力量已不再是一种军事性质的。这股力量包括了大批的技师、工艺家、教师、企业家和其他专家”的时候，他倒是说得很对，或许比他自己所体会的还要恰当些。
    是的，这就是曾向狡滑的丘吉尔先生表明我们已进入一个新的时代的事物。
    不过另外一些事，甚至是一些更重要的事，却使局势更加倒向这一面。
    中国加入了社会主义世界。中国站起来了。一个新的中国，一个富于创造性的中国，一个有着六亿人口的中国，一个有着丰富的矿藏、而在它的巨大江河中拥有几乎是无限的能量的中国，一个有着无穷无尽的潜力，正在工业、农业和文化方面大踏步前进的中国。而且是一个一向是，而现在还是和平和国际友好的热诚拥护者的中国。
    现在，印度也参加进来了，并且同整个东方世界一道来寻求共处和合作。印度的钱德拉·拉尔·纳拉博士在他所著的鲍斯纪念演讲集中说：“在生命中，互助和合作是远比冲突更为有力的因素。”
    尼赫鲁先生的五项原则和万隆会议，都强调了应当强调的东西。东方带头走向了和平共处和合作。
    在东方世界中没有哪个国家在这方面比中国做得更多。在这几个星期中的中国旅行中，我不仅越来越感觉到，中国已走上同苏联一起成为世界最大工业国家的康庄大道，而且还感觉到，中国正同它的伟大盟国一起，成为世界上争取和平和和平共处的领导者。
    中国对它的三千五百万少数民族的正大待遇，它的不是去排挤或征服他们而是把他们提高到同自己的同一水平的努力，这些都最确实不过地表明了中国寻求一个真正的合作世界的真诚意念。
    我比以前更清楚地看出了中国同我自己的国家在两国的贸易方面是多么地互相需要，但是仅仅是由于目前的禁运，贸易停滞下来。
    禁运必须取消。中国可以在走向和平和繁荣的道路上更快地前进，如果我们把卡车、小汽车、内河轮船以及所有我们能制造而又是中国所如此迫切需要的良好机器大量运往它的各个口岸，那么中国就能更快地把它的人民大众的生活提到必要的更高的水平。
    而在取消禁运之后，我们就能够解除我国人民对失业的一切恐惧。我们将会看到一个敞开大门的稳定市场。
    我们将取得并且看到同一个伟大民族的持久友谊，战争的恐惧将会消失，我们将能够把我们的军备裁减到最低限度，并同中国一道怀着前所未有的热情和愉快，走上富裕和繁荣的道路。
    让英国同中国一样，站起来，割掉那束缚着它的贸易的双手的绳索吧。让英国同中国在真诚的合作中携手，并以崇高的方式恢复它一度享有的称号。让它重新成为一个真正的大不列颠。
