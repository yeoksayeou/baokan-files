Friends, younger brothers and sisters:

    Let us laugh first, laugh away! I ask everyone to laugh to their heart's content, because we all have a bright future. (The whole audience laughed and applauded.)

    I am very happy to be with my younger brothers and sisters, and friends. Just now you were standing a little further away from me, and I ask you to move a little closer, because I like to be close to young men and women. You are calling me Brother Karno, and I am very grateful, and I am very excited and moved. If you call me "Your Excellency," it sounds too official; if you call me "Uncle Karno," I feel old; but if you call me "Brother Karno," I feel younger. (Applause and cheers)

    Yes, we are all children of the revolution. The Chinese people are a revolutionary people, and the Indonesian people are also a revolutionary people; Chinese university students are revolutionary university students, and Indonesian university students are also revolutionary university students. Only with a vibrant spirit can we carry out and complete the cause of revolution. (Applause)

    I say that we are all children of the revolution. You are children of the Chinese revolution; we are children of the Indonesian revolution. Furthermore, whether we are the Chinese people or the Indonesian people, we were born in a vigorous revolution, a vigorous world revolution. (Applause)

    I say that we were all born in a vigorous world revolution. Yes, the world has indeed experienced several revolutions. Three or four hundred years ago, the world experienced a commercial revolution; in the nineteenth century, the world experienced an industrial revolution. And now we are living in the twentieth century. The twentieth century has seen an atomic revolution. You university students must have learned from history what a commercial revolution is. The East—China, India, Indonesia—used to be a source of raw materials. Before the commercial revolution, these raw materials passed through Central Asia to what Westerners now call the Near East, then through the Iron Gate all the way to Venice, Italy, and from Venice to various parts of Western Europe. You know from history that that was the golden age of Venice, Italy. The city of Venice was a large and prosperous city because it was the distribution center for Eastern goods. However, later there was a commercial revolution; new routes to the East, to India, Indonesia, China, and Japan, were discovered, and the East could be reached via the Cape of Good Hope. Friends, since then, trade between East and West no longer passed through Central Asia and the Near East, but through the Cape of Good Hope. Therefore, the famous city of Venice declined. Because of the commercial revolution, imperialists came to our countries: to India, to Indonesia, to China, and to the Philippines.

    Not for one year, two years, three years, not for ten years, twenty years, thirty years, but for hundreds of years, the imperialists came to us and took our wealth to Western Europe via the Cape of Good Hope. Thus, we began to become a nation lacking food and mired in poverty. In the commercial revolution, you are familiar with the names of people like Da Gama, Dias, and Magellan. For Indonesia, the name Houtman is familiar to Indonesians; he was the first to bring imperialism to Indonesia. Later, technology and science emerged in Western Europe, some of which you are studying at Tsinghua University today. Technology and science led to a new revolution, the so-called industrial revolution, with the invention of the steam engine, slide rule, spinning machine, loom, and so on. The industrial revolution led to modern capitalism in Western Europe. As modern capitalism expanded more and more, developed more and more, and prospered more and more, capitalism produced imperialism. This imperialism was even more ferocious than the imperialism produced by the commercial revolution. From then on, imperialism flooded our motherland and everyone's motherland; it flooded the motherland of the Egyptians, the motherland of the Arabs, the motherland of the Indians, the motherland of the Vietnamese, the motherland of the Thais, the motherland of the Indonesians, the motherland of the Filipinos, the motherland of the Chinese, and the motherland of the Japanese. Modern imperialism inundated the whole of Asia like a flood.

    Friends! Modern imperialism made us even more miserable, even poorer, and even deprived us of all happiness. If the commercial revolution made us begin to lose our political independence, then the modern imperialism produced by the industrial revolution caused us to lose all our political and economic independence completely. As a result, we became paupers with nothing at all.

    Friends, I suggest you read books that describe the poverty, suffering, and disaster of the Asian people after the industrial revolution. For example, read the book written by the Indian writer Lala Lajpat Rai. In this book, you can learn that thousands upon thousands of people starve to death in India every year. In addition to his book "Unhappy India," you can also read books about Indonesia. Friends, because of the modern imperialist system, the Indonesian nation has become a poor and suffering nation, and their daily living expenses are only two and a half cents per person. We Asian nations refuse to remain silent; we immediately rise up, demanding the restoration of independence, we immediately launch national movements, we want to eliminate the imperialist system that makes us suffer. Friends, is this strange?

    At the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, the "Awakening of Asia" arose. Egypt launched a national movement under the leadership of Arabi Pasha and Mustafa Kamil; the Indian national movement was initially led by veterans such as Dadabhai Naoroji and Surendranath Banerjee, followed by Gandhi, Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru, and the national movement led by Dr. José Rizal y Mercado flourished in the Philippines. The national movement led by Wahidin, Soetomo, Tjokroaminoto, and Semaun flourished in Indonesia.

    China's anti-imperialist movement initially took the form of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom movement, followed by the movement led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and finally the movement led by the great leader Mao Zedong. (Applause)

    Now, you can believe that these movements are not isolated. Not only that, I say that the movement in Algeria, the movement in Morocco, the movement in Tunisia, the movement in Egypt, the movement in India, the movement in Indonesia, the movement in Vietnam, the movement in the Philippines, the movement in China, and even the entire Asian movement, are actually all movements against imperialism and colonialism. (Applause)

    Friends! Therefore, we are spiritually connected to each other. I regard the victory of the Chinese people as my own victory. You regard the victory of the Indonesian people as your victory.

    Indonesia's failure is also your failure. (Applause) Your struggle is our struggle. Our struggle is also your struggle. The revolutions in our two countries have not yet been completed. You have the Taiwan issue, and we have the West Irian issue. Let us all continue to move forward until our ideals are realized. (Applause)

    I am very happy to be able to speak in front of you, to speak on the campus of Tsinghua University. Do you know why I am so happy? Because the history of Tsinghua University and my personal history are actually the same. Tsinghua University was born in 1901, and I was also born in 1901. Tsinghua University is fifty-five years old, and I am also fifty-five years old. Tsinghua University was founded by foreigners, and I was also educated by foreigners. Now the students of Tsinghua University oppose foreign imperialism, and now I also oppose foreign imperialism. (Applause)

    Friends, let me talk about my own history. I was born in 1901. My family was very poor. We didn't necessarily have two or three meals a day. Sometimes we only had one meal a day. When I was your age, I was still very poor and didn't get material comfort. I didn't study under electric lights; I studied under oil lamps. I didn't sleep on thick pillows or mattresses; I slept on bamboo beds. I was very poor. I left the material world because I couldn't find comfort in the material world. I entered the world of books. I read many books. I found comfort in books. In the world of books, in the spiritual world, I learned about great figures from many countries; I learned about Jefferson in America; I learned about Washington in America, Gladstone in England; I learned about Voltaire and Marat in France; I learned about Camille and Molière in France; I learned about Mazzini in Italy; I learned about Mustafa Kamil in Asia; I learned about Marx and Engels in Germany; I learned about V.I. Lenin in Russia; I learned about Dr. Sun Yat-sen in China. (Applause) As I said above, I learned about Gandhi, Lala Lajpat Rai, Surendranath Banerjee, and Motilal Nehru in India, and I learned about Rizal y Mercado in the Philippines. I was inspired by the young spirit of these great figures. Friends, from that moment on, I vowed that until my work of helping the Indonesian people to become an independent nation again is completed, I will work tirelessly. I will continue to work so that the nations of all of Asia can become independent nations and that all of humanity can become a humanistic humanity. (Applause) As a young man, a poor young man, a young man between the ages of eighteen, nineteen, and twenty, I was deeply inspired by your father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen. In my youth, I read the Three Principles of the People, not once but twice, three times, four times, in detail from beginning to end. (Applause)

    As a young man, I was inspired by the Three Principles of the People proposed by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The Three Principles of the People—nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood—inspired my young soul.

    Friends, if you read my speech in 1945, "The Birth of the Five Principles of the Indonesian State," you will know this. In that speech, I said: "Sun Yat-sen is one of those who made Sukarno the Brother Karno of today." (Applause)

    Later, as I grew older and became more mature, I synthesized Dr. Sun Yat-sen's nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. I combined the Three Principles of the People with the theories of the great figures I encountered in the spiritual world. In this, I put in Marx's theory, Engels' theory, Gandhi's theory, Kamil Pasha's theory; I combined it with the various conditions in Indonesia, I combined it with religion, and I combined it with Indonesian customs. Finally, I became the gift that I presented to Indonesia in 1945, which is not the Three Principles of the People, but the "Five Principles," or "Pancasila" (the Five Principles of the Indonesian State). (Applause)

    I am very happy to tell you that this "Pancasila" or "Five Principles" is a treasure that has been unearthed, especially a treasure unearthed from the land of Indonesia, and it has been enriched by the ideas of all great figures from foreign countries.

    There are five basic principles in "Pancasila." The first is belief in one God. The second is Indonesian nationalism. The Indonesian nation is one nation, not two nations, nor three nations. However, Indonesian nationalism is neither chauvinistic nationalism nor arrogant nationalism. Indonesian nationalism believes that we ourselves are part of all mankind, which is the content of the third basic principle. The fourth basic principle is democracy. Sovereignty belongs to the people. It is true democracy. The fifth basic principle is social justice. It makes mankind share weal and woe and have equal status.

    According to our Five Principles, we believe in the divine way. According to our Five Principles, we love our motherland. "Once independent, forever independent!" This is our slogan. I said in the United States, "We are not prepared to sell an inch of land to anyone. We love independence." We say: Once independent, forever independent!

    According to our Five Principles, we believe that we ourselves are with other people. This is the spirit of humanity. You and I are both human beings, and all human beings in the world are the same.

    According to our Five Principles, we love and practice democracy. Our democracy is different from the democracy of Western European countries. Our democracy is a fighting democracy, a democracy that strives to realize the fifth basic principle. The fifth basic principle of the nation is social morality. We want to establish a just and prosperous society, a society where we share weal and woe and have equal status. (Applause)

    There are many basic commonalities, common views, common feelings, common thoughts, and common ideals between us, who follow the Five Principles, and you in the People's Republic of China. Therefore, I believe that the friendship between the People's Republic of China and Indonesia is a true friendship, an eternal friendship. The friendship between us is a friendship that no one can destroy! (Applause)

    Long live the friendship between the People's Republic of China and Indonesia! (Applause)

    Not only is there friendship between the People's Republic of China and Indonesia, but we must also continue to move forward together, continue to move forward with confidence. I say with confidence because our future is bright.

    That's why I asked you all to laugh together just now, to laugh to your heart's content.

    We are not isolated, you are not isolated, and the Indonesian nation is not isolated. In the Asian-African Conference, 1.6 billion people are our friends. If we add all the progressive nations and peoples, that's more than 1.6 billion people, but 2 billion people.

    Come on, let's move forward together. I believe that our ideals will definitely be realized! (Applause)

    Especially you, young men and women, don't feel that you are isolated. Chinese young men and women should not feel that they are isolated. Indonesian young men and women should not feel that they are isolated either. Let young men and women all over the world unite, unite, because the future of the world is in your hands, in your hands, in your hands, in your hands, in your hands, in the hands of Indonesian youth, in the hands of Indian youth, in the hands of youth in other countries. Let us, young men and women, march forward together in a great and magnificent wave! Let's move forward together! The power of youth is great. I often say in Indonesia, give me a million old people, and with these million old people, I can move the high mountains from here to there, but give me a thousand young people, no, a hundred young people will do, as long as they are a hundred energetic young people, and with these hundred young people, I can completely change this world. (Applause)

    I just said: Long live the friendship between China and Indonesia!

    Long live the Chinese people!

    Long live Chinese youth!

    Long live the Indonesian people!

    Long live Indonesian youth!

    Long live the friendship of all mankind!

    Long live world peace! (Applause. The crowd cheered.)

    Most importantly:

    Long live independence!

    Long live freedom!

    Long live true independence and freedom! (Warm applause, the crowd shouted "Independence" for a long time.)

    Finally, let us officially raise our hands. Please wait a moment and shout "Independence" five times with me—I represent Indonesian youth—(Stormy applause, followed by a long shout of "Merdeka"). President Sukarno replied in Chinese: "Thank you."

### 苏加诺在清华大学的演说

1956-10-05
第2版()
专栏：

    苏加诺在清华大学的演说朋友们，弟弟妹妹们：
    大家先欢笑吧，欢笑吧，我要求大家都尽情欢笑，因为我们都同样有着美好的未来。（全场欢笑，鼓掌）
    我非常高兴能够同弟弟妹妹们、朋友们在一起，刚才你们站得离我稍远一点，我要求你们稍微走前一些，因为我本来喜欢接近青年男女。你们高呼着加诺兄，我万分感谢，我非常兴奋和感动。如果称呼我作阁下，这样官场味儿似乎太重了；如果称呼我加诺老伯伯，我就感到自己老了；但是，如果你们称呼我加诺兄，我就变的年轻起来。（鼓掌欢呼）
    是的，我们大家都是革命的儿女，中国人民是革命的人民，印度尼西亚人民也是革命的人民；中国大学生是革命的大学生，印度尼西亚大学生也是革命的大学生。也只有有了朝气勃勃的精神才能去进行和完成革命的事业。（鼓掌）
    我说，我们大家都是革命儿女，你们是中国革命的儿女；我们是印度尼西亚革命的儿女。进一步说，我们无论是中国人民或是印度尼西亚人民都是在轰轰烈烈的革命、轰轰烈烈的世界革命中诞生的。（鼓掌）
    我说，我们都是在轰轰烈烈的世界革命中诞生的。是的，世界确实是经历过几次革命。三、四百年前世界经历了一次商业革命；十九世纪，世界又经历了一次产业革命。而现在我们是生活在二十世纪。二十世纪里发生了原子革命。你们大学生从历史上一定已经知道了什么是商业革命。东方——中国、印度、印度尼西亚——过去是原料供给地。在商业革命前，这些原料经过中亚细亚，到西方人现在称作近东的地方，再经过铁门一直运到意大利的威尼斯，再从威尼斯转到西欧各地。你们从历史上知道，那个时候是意大利威尼斯的黄金时代，威尼斯城是个大而繁荣的城市，由于威尼斯是东方货物的集散地。可是，后来发生了一次商业革命；通向东方，通向印度、印度尼西亚、中国和日本的新航路发现了，经过好望角可以到达东方。朋友们，自那时以后，东西方的贸易不再经过中亚细亚和近东了，而是经过好望角。所以，名城威尼斯衰落了。因为商业革命的发生，帝国主义者来到我们的国家：来到印度、来到印度尼西亚、来到中国和菲律宾。
    不是一年、两年、三年，不是十年、二十年、三十年，而是几百年来，帝国主义者来到我们这里，并且取道好望角把我们的财富运到西欧去，于是我们就开始成为一个缺乏粮食和贫穷的民族。在商业革命中，你们熟悉达伽马、地亚士、麦哲伦这些人的名字。对印度尼西亚来说，霍特曼这个人的名字是印度尼西亚人所熟悉的，他是第一个把帝国主义带到印度尼西亚来的。后来在西欧又产生了技术科学，这些科学有一些就是你们今天在清华大学学习的。技术科学导致了新的革命，即所谓产业革命，发明了蒸汽机、计算尺、纺纱机、织布机等。产业革命使西欧产生了现代的资本主义。当现代资本主义愈来愈扩大、愈来愈发展、愈来愈兴盛的时候，资本主义产生出帝国主义。这一个帝国主义比起由商业革命所产生出来的帝国主义还要凶猛。从此，帝国主义便泛滥到我们的祖国和大家的祖国，它泛滥到埃及人的祖国，阿拉伯人的祖国，印度人的祖国，越南人的祖国，泰国人的祖国，印度尼西亚人的祖国，菲律宾人的祖国，中国人的祖国，日本人的祖国。现代帝国主义像洪水泛滥一般地淹没了整个亚洲。
    朋友们！现代帝国主义使我们更加困苦，更加贫穷，甚至更使我们失去了一切幸福。如果说，商业革命使我们开始丧失政治上的独立，那么，产业革命所产生出来的现代帝国主义便使我们所有的政治上的独立和经济上的独立，全部丧失无遗。因之，我们变成一无所有的穷人。
    朋友们，我建议你们读读描写产业革命后亚洲人民的贫穷、困苦和灾难情况的书籍。譬如读一读印度作家拉拉·拉巴·拉伊写的书。在这本书里，你们可以知道在印度每年有成千上万的人饿死。除了他写的书“灾难的印度”以外，你们还可以读读有关印度尼西亚的书籍。朋友们，由于现代的帝国主义制度，印度尼西亚民族成了贫穷苦难的民族，他们每人每天的生活费用只有两分半钱。我们亚洲民族不肯默而无言，我们立即奋发而起，要求恢复独立，我们立刻展开了民族运动，我们要消灭使我们遭苦受难的帝国主义制度。朋友们，这难道奇怪吗？
    十九世纪末二十世纪初兴起了“亚洲的觉醒”；埃及在亚拉比帕夏和穆斯塔法·加米尔领导下掀起了民族运动；印度的民族运动最初由达达巴伊·瑙罗基、苏令·特拉那德·伯尼基等先辈领导，继起的还有甘地，莫地拉尔·尼赫鲁、贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁和何塞·利萨·伊米尔卡多博士领导的民族运动在菲律宾蓬勃展开。哇希亭，苏迪罗胡梭多，佐克罗亚米诺多和司马温等人领导的民族运动在印度尼西亚蓬勃展开。
    中国的反对帝国主义运动最初是形成太平天国运动，接着是孙逸仙博士领导的运动，最后是伟大的领袖毛泽东所领导的运动。（鼓掌）
    现在，你们可以相信，这些运动都不是孤立的。不仅如此，我说，阿尔及利亚的运动，摩洛哥的运动，突尼斯的运动，埃及的运动，印度的运动，印度尼西亚的运动，越南的运动，菲律宾的运动，中国的运动，以至整个亚洲的运动，实际上都是一个反对帝国主义和殖民主义的运动。（鼓掌）
    朋友们！因此我们在精神上是互相联系在一起的。我把中国人民的胜利看成是自己的胜利。你们把印度尼西亚人民的胜利看成是你们的胜利。
    印度尼西亚的失败也就是你们的失败。（鼓掌）你们的斗争就是我们的斗争。我们的斗争也就是你们的斗争。我们两国的革命还没有完成。你们有台湾问题，我们有西伊里安问题。我们大家都继续前进，直到我们的理想实现。（鼓掌）
    我能在你们面前讲话，能在清华大学的校园里讲话，感到非常高兴。你们知道吗，为什么我感到如此般地高兴？因为，清华大学的历史和我个人的历史实际上是一样的。清华大学诞生在1901年，我也生在1901年。清华大学五十五岁了，我也五十五岁了。清华大学是由外国人创办的，而我也是受外国的教育的。现在清华大学的学生反对外国帝国主义，现在的我也反对外国帝国主义。
  （鼓掌）
    朋友们，让我谈谈我自己的历史。我生在1901年，我的家庭很穷，每天不一定吃上两、三顿饭，有时一天只能吃一顿饭。我在像你们这么大年纪的时候，也还是很穷，得不到物质上的安慰。我不是在电灯光下读书，我是在油灯下读书的。我不是睡在厚厚的枕头或者垫子上，我是睡在竹榻上。我很穷。我离开了物质世界，因为我在物质世界里得不到安慰。我走进了书的世界。我读了许多书。我从书本里面找到了安慰。在书的世界里，在精神的世界里，我知道了许多国家的伟大人物；我知道了美国的杰斐逊；我知道了美国的华盛顿、英国的格拉德斯东；我知道了法国的伏尔泰和马拉；我知道了法国的卡米尔和莫里哀；我知道了意大利的马志尼；我知道了亚洲的穆斯塔法·加米尔；我知道了德国的马克思和恩格斯；我知道了俄国的弗·伊·列宁；我知道了中国的孙逸仙博士。（鼓掌）正如上面我说过的，我知道了印度的甘地、拉拉·拉巴拉伊、苏令·特拉那德·伯尼基和莫地拉尔·尼赫鲁，知道了菲律宾的伊米尔卡多。我受到了这些伟大人物的年轻精神的鼓舞。朋友们，从那个时候起，我就发誓，在我帮助印度尼西亚人民重新成为独立的民族的工作没有完成之前，我就要不停止地工作，我要继续工作，使全亚洲的民族都能成为独立的民族，使全世界的人类成为一个具有人道主义的人类。（鼓掌）作为一个青年，贫苦的青年，年轻的青年，十八、十九、二十岁之间的青年，我深深受到你们的父亲孙逸仙博士的鼓舞。在青年时代，我阅读过三民主义，我不是一次而是两次、三次、四次，从头到尾地详细阅读三民主义（鼓掌）。
    作为一个青年，我受到孙逸仙博士所提出的三民主义的鼓舞。三民主义，即民族、民权、民生鼓舞了我年青的灵魂。
    朋友们，你们要是读到我在1945年所作的演说“印度尼西亚建国五基的诞生”的时候，你们就会知道这件事情的。在那一次演说里面，我说：“使苏加诺成为今日的加诺兄的，孙中山就是其中之一。”（鼓掌）
    后来，我年纪大了，变得更成熟了，我把孙逸仙博士的民族主义、民权主义和民生主义加以综合，我把三民主义同我在精神世界里所接触到的伟大人物的理论结合在一起。在这里面，我放进了马克思的理论，恩格斯的理论，甘地的理论，加米尔帕夏的理论；我又把它同印度尼西亚的各种情况结合起来，我把它同宗教结合起来，把它同印度尼西亚的风俗习惯结合起来。最后，我成为我在1945年呈献给印度尼西亚的礼品，它不是三民主义，而是“五民主义”，或者是“潘查希拉”（印度尼西亚建国五基）。（鼓掌）
    我很高兴地告诉大家，这“潘查希拉”或者“五民主义”，它是发掘出来的宝藏，尤其是从印度尼西亚土地上发掘出来的宝藏，它是为外国一切伟大人物的思想所丰富起来的。
      “潘查希拉”里面有五项基本原则。第一是信奉唯一的真主。第二是印度尼西亚的民族主义。印度尼西亚民族是一个民族，不是两个民族，也不是三个民族。但是，印度尼西亚的民族主义，既不是沙文民族主义，也不是自高自大的民族主义。印度尼西亚的民族主义认为我们自己是全人类的一部分，这也就是第三项基本原则的内容。第四项基本原则是民主，主权属于人民，它是真正的民主。第五项基本原则是社会正义，它使人类同甘共苦，地位平等。
    根据我们的建国五基，我们信仰神道。根据我们的建国五基，我们热爱我们的祖国。“一旦独立，永远独立！”这就是我们的口号。我在美国时说过：“我们不准备出卖一寸土地给任何人，我们热爱独立。”我们说：一旦独立，永远独立！
    根据我们的建国五基，我们认为，我们自己是和其他的人们在一起的。这就是人道精神。你我同是人类，世界上的人类都是一样的。
    根据我们的建国五基，我们热爱并实行民权主义。我们的民主同西欧国家的民主不一样。我们的民主是战斗的民主，是为实现第五项基本原则而奋斗的民主。第五项建国基本原则就是社会道义。我们要建立公正而繁荣的社会，冷暖同尝，地位平等的社会。（鼓掌）
    遵奉建国五基的我们和在中华人民共和国的你们之间，有着很多基本的共同点，有着共同的见解，共同的情感，共同的思想，共同的理想。因此，我相信，中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚之间的友谊，是真正的友谊，是永恒的友谊。我们之间的友谊是任何人也破坏不了的友谊！（鼓掌）
    中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚的友谊万岁！
  （鼓掌）
    中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚之间不仅存在着友谊，我们还要一起继续向前迈进，满怀信心地继续向前迈进。我说满怀信心，是因为我们的前途是光辉灿烂的。
    正因为这样，所以，刚才我请你们大家一起欢笑，尽情地欢笑。
    我们大家都不是孤立的，你们不是孤立的，印度尼西亚民族也不是孤立的。在亚非会议里面，十六亿人民都是我们的朋友。要是加上全体进步的民族和人民，那就不止十六亿人，而是二十亿人了。
    来吧，我们一起迈步向前。我相信，我们的理想一定能够实现！（鼓掌）
    特别是你们，男女青年们，更不要感到你们是孤立的，中国的男女青年们不要感到自己是孤立的，印度尼西亚男女青年们也不要感到自己是孤立的。全世界的男女青年们都联合起来吧，联合起来吧，因为世界的未来是在你们的手中，在你们手中，在你们手中，在你们手中，在你们手中，在印度尼西亚青年的手中，在印度青年的手中，在其他国家青年的手中。让我们，男女青年们，在一个伟大的而壮阔的浪涛里齐步前进吧！一起前进吧！青年的力量是伟大的。我在印度尼西亚经常说，给我一百万名老年人，有了这一百万名老年人，我就可以把高山从这里移到那边，可是，给我一千名青年，不，一百名青年也行，只要是一百名朝气勃勃的青年，有了这一百名青年我就能够把这个世界完全改变过来。（鼓掌）
    我刚才说的：中国、印度尼西亚的友谊万岁！
      中国人民万岁！
    中国青年万岁！
    印度尼西亚人民万岁！
    印度尼西亚青年万岁！
    全人类的友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！（鼓掌。群众欢呼）
    最重要的是：
    独立万岁！
    自由万岁！
    真正的独立和自由万岁！
      （热烈鼓掌，群众长时间高呼：独立）
    最后，让我们正式地举起手来吧，请你们等会儿跟我——我代表印度尼西亚青年——一道高呼五次“独立”（暴风雨般的掌声，接着长时间高呼“默地加”。苏加诺总统用中国语答称：
  “谢谢”。）
