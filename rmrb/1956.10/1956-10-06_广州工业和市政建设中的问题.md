Problems in Guangzhou's Industrial and Municipal Construction
Wang De, First Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Guangzhou is a coastal city with developed commerce and a certain industrial base. After liberation, industrial production has been developing year by year, with the industrial output value last year increasing threefold compared to 1950. However, these are mainly small enterprises with simple equipment. To fully utilize these enterprises, we must pay more attention to improving their management and technical equipment. South China is a place rich in technical crops, and Guangzhou is the economic center of South China. Certain industries have suitable conditions for development in Guangzhou. However, in recent years, we have done little in improving management and even less in expanding and building new equipment, so the people criticize us: "The talk of industrialization is so loud, but not a single new smokestack is seen."

Coastal cities have the responsibility to support the construction of the interior, and therefore, coastal industries must be appropriately maintained and developed in order to better shoulder this responsibility. We did not have a clear understanding of this in the past, and we did not firmly insist on developing more industries in Guangzhou. This is something we should examine. I believe that some central departments also did not see this comprehensively. Taking the power industry as an example: since liberation, a total of 39,100 kilowatts of power equipment have been dismantled and moved away from Guangzhou, which is nearly half of the original equipment, resulting in very tight loads. This year, there is a shortage of 8,200 kilowatts. Now we often have to cut off power by districts, and even the roads are dark when the power is off, which makes the masses very dissatisfied. This problem should be solved quickly. The central competent department has already promised us to add two machines next year with a total of 22,500 kilowatts, but even this is not enough. However, it is said that now they want to cut one off, leaving only one. When the machine will arrive and when construction can start is still uncertain. Originally, when our needs were not yet urgent and we had surplus equipment, it was right to transfer some surplus equipment to support the urgent needs of the interior. But during the last demolition and transfer of 15,000 kilowatts in 1954, we felt that this was a bit too much. We disagreed with this. Later, they promised that as soon as the foreign orders arrived, they would give priority to replenishing the equipment to our city, and we reluctantly agreed. As a result, there is still no sign of it. The current situation is really difficult, and we cannot but hope that the relevant central departments will take more care.

There are still many unemployed people in our city, and there are also too many people employed in commerce. In the past few years, we have made some efforts in industry, increasing employment by more than 26,000 people, and we have also tried to place some people in other areas. This year, we have mobilized more than 100,000 people to return to their hometowns, but the problem has still not been resolved. Most of the remaining people cannot be mobilized to return to their hometowns, and some people have difficulty being transferred to other places. Therefore, even for the sake of solving the employment problem, we must expand and build some industries in our city. In the past, we also wanted to set up some industries, but the local government had no money. Even if we managed to raise some money by various means and wanted to build a few factories, it was not easy to get the plans approved. Some central competent departments are generally too strict and tight with our industrial expansion and new construction plans. For example, the new Sino-foreign joint venture sugar factory with a daily crushing capacity of 2,000 tons and the ramie textile factory with 20,000 spindles, which are invested by overseas Chinese, were repeatedly requested from various relevant agencies many times. In the end, a central leader directly understood the situation and gave support before they were approved. Some of our industrial raw material supplies are also too tight. In fact, Guangzhou has small factories with a wide variety of industries, so the variety of raw materials needed is large, but the quantity is not large. As long as a little more is allocated, the problem will be solved. If a few kinds are given less, it will cause us great difficulties. Moreover, the utilization rate of industrial equipment in Guangzhou is now very low. Even for a few industries with better quality and more famous products, the equipment utilization rate is only about 30 percent. If the production tasks are further reduced, it will be even more difficult to maintain.

Organizing the export of industrial products is also a major issue in our city's economic life. Before the war, our city's industrial and handicraft products were exported in large quantities. Handicraft products alone had more than 2,000 varieties, and compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao and overseas Chinese are accustomed to and like to use products from their hometowns. But now the varieties and quantities of exports are very small. For example, cotton cloth exports in 1937 were 650,000 US dollars, but in 1955 only 90,000 US dollars; handicraft product exports in 1954 were only 110 kinds. We must actively restore and expand the traditional foreign markets of the past, and we hope that the relevant central departments can give us more support. For example, allocate some foreign exchange to us to be managed by the foreign trade bureau to buy raw materials, make industrial products for export, earn the surplus foreign exchange and hand it over, and leave the original funds for repeated use. This can make production active.

Our city is a major city at the gate of the country, and municipal construction cannot be too backward. But the municipal construction funds given by the relevant central departments are too small. This year, a total of 6 million yuan of municipal construction funds were given to Guangdong Province (of which 2 million yuan was designated for Zhanjiang City). If this amount is entirely given to Guangzhou for use, it will only be barely enough for maintenance expenses, and it will of course be difficult to talk about increasing new municipal construction. More than 20 years ago, four sentences were popular in Guangzhou: "The lights are dim, the telephones don't work, the roads are uneven, and the tap water is unclear." Now people are saying that these situations are gradually reappearing. Indeed, the first two have reappeared. As for road maintenance, it would be difficult to cope with this year if the province had not managed to allocate an additional 4 million yuan. These situations, coupled with the large number of unemployed people, the small amount of industrial construction, the high prices, and the tight supply of non-staple foods, have led to more opinions from the masses. Moreover, we are right next to the capitalist world, and people come and go, and they always compare it to Guangzhou. Although we were originally backward, we should not be too eager to overemphasize the appearance of the city. However, without affecting national industrialization, it is still very necessary to build Guangzhou, the southern gateway city, into a decent one.

    广州工业和市政建设中的问题
    中共广州市委第一书记　王德
    广州市是一个商业发达而又有一定工业基础的沿海城市。解放后，工业生产是逐年发展的，工业产值去年比1950年增加了两倍。但主要是些小型企业，设备简陋。要充分利用这些企业，就必须更多地注意改善其经营管理和技术设备。华南是技术作物富饶的地方，广州是华南的经济中心，若干工业在广州是有较适宜的发展条件的。但几年来我们在改善经营管理方面作得少，扩建与新建设备的更少，所以老百姓批评我们：“工业化讲得那么轰动，不见添一条烟筒”。
    沿海城市有支援内地建设的责任，因而沿海工业要有适当的维持与发展，才能更好地担负起这个责任。对于这点，我们过去认识得不明确，对广州市要求多搞点工业坚持不力，这是我们应当检讨的。我认为中央有些部门，对于这一点，也是曾经看得不全面的。拿电力工业来说：解放以后，先后从广州拆除迁走的电力设备共达三万九千一百瓩，将近原有设备的一半，以致负荷非常紧张，今年便短八千二百瓩。现在常常要分区停电，停电时连马路上也是黑的，群众很不满。这问题是应该很快解决的。中央主管部门本已答应我们明年增加两付机器共二万二千五百瓩，就是这样，也还是不够的。但是据说现在又要削掉一个，剩下一个，机器何时来，何时才能动工，也还未定。本来，在我们需要未见紧张，尚有多余设备的时候，迁移一些多余的设备去支援内地的急需，这是应该的。但在1954年最后一次拆迁一万五千瓩时，我们觉得这样做，未免太过些。对此，我们是不同意的，后来答应只等国外订货到，便优先把设备补回给我市，我们才勉强同意了。结果到现在还没有影子。现在的情况实在困难，不能不希望中央有关部门多照顾一下。
    我市尚未就业的人口很多，商业从业人员也过多。几年来我们从工业方面虽然作了些努力，增加了二万六千多人就业，从其它方面也设法安置了一些，今年又已动员了十万多人回乡，但问题还是未能解决。剩下来的这些人，大都是不能动员回乡的，有些人外调也是有困难的。所以现在就是为了解决就业问题，也非在我市扩建新建一些工业不可了。过去我们也想办些工业，但地方上没有钱；即使我们用各种办法弄了点钱，想建几个工厂，计划也不很容易获得批准。中央有些主管部门，对我们的工业扩建新建计划，一般是扣得太死太紧，例如对今年新建的由华侨投资公私合营日榨两千吨的糖厂和两万锭子的苎麻纺织厂，也是反复向有关各机关请求多次，最后还是中央负责同志直接了解了情况，给予支持，才获得批准的。对我们的工业原料供应，有些也偏紧。其实广州的厂小，各行各业都有，所需的原料品种虽多，但数量不大，只要增拨一点，便解决了问题。如果少给了几种，少给了一些，就会造成我们很大的困难。而且，现在广州市工业设备利用率很低，就是几种产品质量较好、较著名的工业，其设备利用率也仅在百分之三十左右。如果再压缩生产任务，就更难维持了。
    组织工业品出口，也是我市经济生活中的一个大问题。战前我市工业品和手工业品是大量出口的，单手工业品出口的便有两千多种，港澳同胞和海外华侨都习惯和喜欢用家乡的东西。但现在出口的品种和数量都很少。例如棉布出口一九三七年为六十五万美元，一九五五年只九万美元；手工业品出口，一九五四年只有一百一十种。我们必须积极恢复和扩大过去传统的国外市场，希望中央有关部门能更多地支持我们。例如拨给我们一些外汇由外贸局掌握，买进原料，制成工业品出口，挣得多余的外汇上缴，原款留下反复使用，这便可以使生产活跃起来。
    我市是处于国门的大城，市政建设也是不能太落后的。但中央有关部门给的市政建设费太少了，今年给了广东全省市政建设费共六百万元（其中指定要给湛江市两百万元），这数字全部给广州用，也只勉强够维持的费用，要增加新的市政建设当然就很难谈到了。二十多年前，广州流行过四句话：电灯不明，电话不灵，马路不平，自来水不清。现在人们又纷纷说这些情形逐渐重现了。的确，前两项已重现了，马路的维修，今年如不是省里设法增拨了四百万元，也是很难应付。这些情况，再加上尚未就业的人多，工业建设少，物价偏高，副食品供应紧张，这样，群众的意见便更多了。而且，我们那里，一出去便是资本主义世界，人来人往，他们总是要拿广州来相比的。虽然我们原来落后，也不应急于过分讲究城市的外表，但在不影响国家工业化的前提下，把广州这个南方大门口的城市建设得像样一点，还是很有必要的。
