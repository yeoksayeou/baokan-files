    Wuhan Municipal Party Committee Industrial Production Political Work Conference Decides
    Resolutely Implement the Party's Collective Leadership System
    Guarantee Comprehensive and Over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan

    (Our Newspaper News) The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held the Second Industrial Production Political Work Conference of 1956, and discussed the issue of further strengthening the Party's leadership in industrial enterprises. The meeting decided to resolutely implement the Party's collective leadership system and the working style of the mass line in industrial enterprises, and to deeply carry out the advanced producer movement, so as to ensure the early, comprehensive, and over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan.
    Since the implementation of the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's February Industrial Symposium and the Ministry of Industry Conference convened by the Central Government last year, industrial enterprises in the Wuhan area have begun to correct the erroneous practice of unilaterally emphasizing the "one-chief system" in the past, and have basically realized the system of combining collective leadership of the Party committee and individual responsibility. This shift has had a significant promoting effect on improving political and production work in industrial enterprises; however, due to the influence of the "one-chief system" promoted in the past, some enterprises still have undesirable tendencies of neglecting the Party's leading role. This meeting, combined with the study of relevant documents from the Central Committee, further criticized the error of unilaterally emphasizing the "one-chief system." The meeting held that: Practice has proved that the result of unilaterally promoting the "one-chief system" weakened the Party's leading role in industrial enterprises, and fostered the commandism and bureaucratic work style of enterprise leading cadres. The participants unanimously supported the spirit of the Central Committee's report to the Eighth National Congress of the Party, and believed that the Party organizations in industrial enterprises, like Party organizations on other fronts, must implement the leadership system that combines the Party's collective leadership and individual responsibility. The meeting held that: Strengthening and establishing the Party committee's collective leadership system is a fundamental issue in improving production management work, therefore, it is wrong to think that with the Party's collective leadership, administrative work can be weakened, or that it is not necessary to establish a scientific production management system. The meeting also pointed out: The Party organizations in enterprises must strengthen their leadership over the trade union and the Communist Youth League organizations, and give full play to their organizational role.
    The meeting emphasized that: At present, in industrial enterprises, we must focus on deeply carrying out the advanced producer movement, and in the movement, establish and improve the Party committee's collective leadership system and the working methods of the mass line, so as to improve the Party's leadership level. At the same time, we must strengthen the education of workers and staff on comprehensively completing the plan, and we must improve the production level of enterprises by implementing the policy of improving technology, reforming technology, and learning and mastering new technologies. The meeting held that: Now we are facing the last quarter of the year, and there are still many difficulties in completing the plan, therefore, everyone is required to strengthen their confidence, overcome these difficulties, resolutely guarantee the comprehensive and over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan, and strive to make more products catch up with the advanced level of the whole country.
    During the meeting, more than ten units, including Wuhan State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1, Yuhua Yarn Factory, and Nanyang Tobacco Factory, respectively introduced their experiences in Party's collective leadership, mass line, and caring for the lives of workers and staff. (Lü Naixiang)

    武汉市委工业生产政治工作会议决定
    坚决执行党的集体领导制度
    保证全面超额完成第一个五年计划
    本报讯　中共武汉市委最近举行的1956年第二次工业生产政治工作会议，讨论了进一步加强党在工业企业中的领导问题。会议决定在工业企业中坚决贯彻党的集体领导制度和群众路线的工作作风，深入开展先进生产者运动，保证提前、全面、超额完成第一个五年计划。
    自从去年贯彻省委二月工业座谈会议和中央召开的工业部长会议精神以来，武汉地区工业企业开始纠正了过去片面强调“一长制”的错误作法，基本上实现了党委集体领导和个人负责相结合的制度。这一转变，对改进工业企业中的政治工作和生产工作，产生了重大的推动作用；但是由于过去推行“一长制”的影响，至今在某些企业中还遗留着忽视党的领导作用的不良倾向。这次会议结合学习中央有关文件，进一步批判了片面强调“一长制”的错误。会议认为：实践证明，片面推行“一长制”的结果，削弱了党对工业企业的领导作用，并且助长了企业领导干部的命令主义和官僚主义作风。到会人员一致拥护党的第八次全国代表大会中央委员会的报告精神，在工业企业中的党组织，同其它战线的党组织一样，必须贯彻执行以党的集体领导和个人负责相结合的领导制度。会议认为：健全与建立党委集体领导制度，是改进生产管理工作的根本问题，因此，那种认为有了党的集体领导，就可以削弱行政工作，或者以为不必要建立科学的生产管理制度，都是错误的。会议同时也指出：企业中的党组织，必须加强对工会、青年团组织的领导，充分发挥他们的组织作用。
    会议强调指出：当前工业企业中，要以深入的开展先进生产者运动为中心，在运动中，建立和健全党委集体领导制度和群众路线的工作方法，提高党的领导水平。同时，对职工要加强全面完成计划的教育，要以贯彻提高技术、改进技术、学习和掌握新技术的方针，去提高企业的生产水平。会议认为：现在已面临一年最后的一个季度，完成计划还有不少困难，因此，要求大家坚定信心，克服这些困难，坚决保证全面超额完成第一个五年计划，力争更多的产品赶上全国的先进水平。
    会议期间，武汉国棉一厂、裕华纱厂、南洋烟厂等十多个单位，分别介绍了党的集体领导、群众路线和关心职工生活的经验。　（吕乃祥）
