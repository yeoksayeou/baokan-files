    New Steelmaking Workshop at Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant
    A new converter steelmaking workshop with an annual output of 100,000 tons of steel, recently built at the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, is undergoing intense equipment installation. It is estimated that it will be put into production in early November this year. The equipment in this workshop is the most advanced in our country's converter steelmaking equipment.

    上海第三钢厂新建的一个年产十万吨钢的转炉炼钢车间，正在紧张地安装设备。估计在今年11月上旬就能投入生产。这个车间的设备，在我国转炉炼钢设备中是最新颖的。
