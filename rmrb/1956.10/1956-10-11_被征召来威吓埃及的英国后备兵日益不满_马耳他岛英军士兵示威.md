Xinhua News Agency, London, 10th: Dissatisfaction is growing among the 10,000 British reservists who have been called up for military intimidation against Egypt. Following the recent incident in Cyprus where twenty-one British reservists were arrested for demanding to go home, on October 5th, approximately 200 British Grenadier Guards stationed in Malta held a mass demonstration to protest the unnecessary and heavy duties imposed on them by the British military authorities in order to keep them constantly occupied. Half of the soldiers participating in the demonstration were reservists. They sent fifty representatives to the officers' mess to protest. The demonstrating troops were blocked by guards with fixed bayonets.

A British military spokesperson said that the officer who received the soldiers read the "Mutiny Act" to the soldiers, a traditional threat to prosecute the most serious military crimes.

Less than a few hours after the British government received reports of these soldiers' disturbances on the 9th, it issued a formal announcement regarding the conscription of reservists. The announcement stated that it was necessary to keep these conscripted reservists on active duty because "the emergency situation caused by the actions of Egypt has not been eliminated."

    被征召来威吓埃及的英国后备兵日益不满
    马耳他岛英军士兵示威
    据新华社10日讯　伦敦消息：在为对埃及实行军事恫吓而征召起来的一万名英国后备兵员中间，不满情绪正在滋长。继最近塞浦路斯发生的二十一名英国后备兵因要求回家而被逮捕的事件之后，5日驻扎在马耳他岛上的英国榴弹警卫队举行了约二百人的群众性示威，抗议英军当局为了使他们经常处于忙碌状态中而强加在他们身上的不必要的繁重勤务。参加示威游行的士兵有一半是后备兵。他们派出了五十名代表到军官食堂去提出抗议。示威的队伍受到上了刺刀的卫兵们的拦阻。
    一个英国军方的发言人说，接见士兵的军官对士兵们宣读了“叛变法案”，这是一种传统的要对最严重的军事罪行提出起诉的威胁。
    英国政府在9日接到关于这些士兵骚动事件的报告后不到几个小时，就发表了一项关于征召后备役兵员问题的正式公告。公告说，使这些被征召的后备兵继续服现役是必要的，因为“埃及的行动所造成的紧急状况还没有消除”。
