    Bring into Play Enthusiasm and Creativity, Adapt to National Construction Needs
    Many Factories Successfully Trial-Produce a Large Number of New Products
    Measuring Tool & Cutting Tool Factory Produces New Instruments for Checking Quality
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Harbin Measuring Tool & Cutting Tool Factory has begun small-batch production of two new instruments for checking gear quality – a gear involute measuring instrument and a gear comprehensive measuring instrument. This is the first time these new instruments have been produced in China.
    In the past, general machine tool manufacturing factories used the best helical gear milling cutters to mill gears, but still could not guarantee quality. Now, with these two instruments, gear quality can be guaranteed, and the machine tools produced will have no noise. Currently, workers in the factory's trial production workshop are also trial-producing a third instrument for checking gears – a gear helix deviation measuring instrument.
    New Products of Yumen Refinery
    Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, 21st. Xinhua News Agency Reporter Yao Bingjian reports: From January to the present, the Yumen Oilfield Refinery has successfully trial-produced fifteen new products, nine of which have already been put into production. After chemical verification, these new products have been proven to meet the standards stipulated by the state.
    This year, in order to trial-produce more new products, the refinery actively sought to increase the staff and equipment of the Oil Product Research Office and established an Oil Product Analysis Group, a New Product Trial Production Group, and an Oil Product Quality Improvement Group. These organizations have played a significant role in the research and trial production of oil products and the improvement of quality.
    The refinery's chief engineer and the director of the Oil Product Research Office told reporters that although the refinery has made some achievements in trial-producing new products this year, the initial quality standards for several new products were not high enough, and there was insufficient communication with user departments during the trial production process. Therefore, after the user departments tested these fifteen trial-produced new products, except for one for which a response has not yet been received, the quality of two products cannot fully meet the requirements of users and needs to be further improved. Currently, in addition to continuing to solicit opinions from user departments on the new products and actively seeking ways to improve the quality of the new products, the refinery plans to trial-produce another batch of new products by the end of this year to meet the diverse needs of the country.
    Dalian Paint Factory's New Products Reach Sixty-Seven
    Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, 21st. The state-owned Dalian Paint Factory recently successfully trial-produced a spray paint that can resist sulfuric acid corrosion. This is the sixty-seventh new product that the factory has successfully trial-produced this year.
    These paints that the state-owned Dalian Paint Factory has successfully trial-produced this year are all important materials needed in national construction. Among them are fire-resistant spray paints with very high temperature resistance and fire prevention performance, as well as many kinds of water-resistant and oil-resistant spray paints. A spray paint that can resist acid and alkali corrosion, when applied to machinery and equipment that is often in contact with sulfuric acid and caustic soda liquids, can reduce the degree of corrosion of the equipment and extend its lifespan.
    These new products are very popular with China's industrial departments. They have replaced foreign products and are being supplied in large quantities to chemical plants, steel plants, and machine factories that are under construction and in production.
    Zhangjiakou Prospecting Machinery Factory Manufactures 500-Meter Drilling Rig
    Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 21st. The first 500-meter drilling rig successfully trial-produced by the Zhangjiakou Prospecting Machinery Factory No. 1 is currently drilling its fifth borehole on Yanran Mountain. For more than three months, this drilling rig has been tested by different strata, proving that the drilling rig is strong and durable and of good quality.
    This drilling rig was sent to the Yanran Mountain exploration site for testing in mid-June. Xi Yilin, an experienced old driller, said: "The workers are very satisfied with this new machine. Many of its parts are similar to the Soviet drilling rigs that have been used for a long time.
    The workers are particularly interested in the several protective devices added to this drilling rig, because it can avoid personal accidents. This shows that attention has been paid to human care in the design."
    Shanghai Youth Zhang Songpo Manufactures Eight New Optical Instruments
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 21st. In the nine months since his enterprise became a joint state-private venture, Zhang Songpo, a young capitalist from Shanghai, has successfully trial-produced eight new types of optical equipment.
    A gynecological medical device recently successfully trial-produced – a hysteroscope – is composed of a set of rice-grain-sized lenses. After refraction through the lenses, doctors can directly observe the condition inside the uterine cavity, which is much better than the general method of only roughly examining the uterine cavity by taking X-ray films.
    Zhang Songpo is an engineer at the joint state-private Shanghai Tianyi Medical Equipment Factory and the manager of the Guanghua Optical Shop. The new products he has successfully trial-produced also include a nasopharyngoscope that is about to be exhibited abroad, various lenses for a fundus camera that explores the secrets of the fundus, a tracheoscope that can directly and vertically observe the tracheal wall, and a multi-purpose magnifying glass for the ears, eyes, nose, and throat that resembles a small telescope. Among them, the nasopharyngoscope has already been put into mass production.

    发挥积极性创造性  适应国家建设需要
    不少工厂试制成功大批新产品
    量具刃具厂生产检查质量的新仪器
    新华社讯　哈尔滨量具刃具厂开始小批生产两种检查齿轮质量的新仪器——齿轮渐开线检查仪和齿轮综合检查仪。这是我国第一次生产的新仪器。
    一般机床制造工厂过去是用最好的螺旋齿轮铣刀来铣齿轮，但是仍然不能保证质量。现在，有了这两种仪器就可以保证齿轮质量，做出的机床没有噪音。目前，这个厂试造车间的工人又在试造第三种检查齿轮的仪器——齿向偏摆检查仪。
    玉门炼油厂的新产品
    新华社玉门21日电　新华社记者姚秉鉴报道：玉门油矿炼油厂从今年1月到现在，已经试制成功了十五种新产品，其中有九种已经投入生产。这些新产品经过化验证明，质量达到了国家规定的标准。
    炼油厂今年为了试制更多的新产品，积极设法增添了油品研究室的职工和机器设备，并且成立了油品分析组、新产品试制组和油品质量改进组。这些组织，对研究油品的试制和提高质量，都起了很大作用。
    炼油厂总工程师和油品研究室主任对记者说，今年炼油厂在试制新产品方面虽然取得了一定的成绩，但是由于有几种新产品最初规定的质量标准不够高，在试制过程中同使用部门又联系不够，因此试制成的这十五种新产品经使用部门试用以后，除了有一种还未见答复以外，有两种产品的质量还不能完全符合使用者的要求，须继续加以改进提高。目前炼油厂除了继续征求使用部门对新产品的意见，积极设法改进新产品的质量以外，计划到今年年底再试制一批新产品，以适应国家多方面的需要。
    大连油漆厂的新产品达六十七种
    新华社旅大21日电　国营大连油漆厂最近试制成功了一种抗得住硫酸腐蚀的喷漆。这是这个工厂今年试制成功的第六十七种新产品。
    国营大连油漆厂今年试制成功的这些油漆，都是国家建设中需要的重要物资。其中有抗温防火效能很高的耐火喷漆，也有不少种耐水、耐油喷漆。有一种能抗住酸、碱腐蚀的喷漆，把它涂在经常与硫酸、火碱液体接触的机器设备上，便能减低设备被腐蚀的程度，延长设备的寿命。
    这些新产品很受我国工业部门的欢迎。它们代替了外来品，大量地供应着正在建设和生产的化学厂、钢铁厂和机器厂。
    张家口探矿机械厂制成五百公尺钻机
    新华社保定21日电　张家口探矿机械一厂试制成功的第一台五百公尺钻探机，正在燕然山上钻着第五个钻孔。三个多月来，这台钻探机受到了不同地层的考验，证明钻机坚固耐用，质量良好。
    这台钻机是在6月中旬送到燕然山勘探工地去进行试验的。富有经验的老钻工席溢林说：“工人们对这台新机器很满意，它的许多部件，都和过去长期使用着的苏联钻探机差不多。
    工人们对这台钻机增加的好几个防护设备特别感兴趣，因为它能避免发生人身事故。这是设计上注意了对人的关怀。
    上海青年张松坡制成八种新的光学仪器
    据新华社上海21日电　上海青年资本家张松坡在企业合营后的九个月里，已经试制成功八种新的光学器材。
    最近试制成功的一种妇科医疗器械——子宫镜，是由一组米粒般大小的镜片组成的，经过镜片的折射，医生可以直接地观察子宫腔内的状况，比一般用拍摄爱克斯光片只能粗略地检查子宫腔的方法，要优越得多。
    张松坡是公私合营上海天谊医疗器械厂的工程师和光华眼镜商店经理。他试制成功的新产品还有正准备出国展览的鼻咽镜，窥探眼底秘密的眼底摄影机的各种镜片，可以直视和垂直观察气管壁的气管镜和像小型望远镜似的耳眼鼻喉多用扩大镜等。其中鼻咽镜已经成批生产。
