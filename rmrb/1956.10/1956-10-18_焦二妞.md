    Jiao Erniu, Electric Shovel Operator, Jiao Zuo Coal Mine, Li Liankui
    Jiao Erniu used to work with her father as a coal selector at the Li Ji Mine's coal selection plant. Every day, she carried large baskets weighing over a hundred pounds, enduring the sun and wind and snow, which turned her into a chubby little girl.

    At the end of 1953, the leadership decided to transfer her to load trains and learn to operate an electric shovel [note]. She was very happy and smiled at me, saying, "Brother Liankui, Director Xu said today that he wants me to learn to operate an electric shovel. You have to teach me well!" I said, "That goes without saying, old neighbor."

    Later, I went to the street and ran into Liu Dingwu, who was the responsible driver on our electric shovel. Dingwu saw me and smiled, saying, "Tomorrow, a female worker will be transferred to our group. Do you know who's being transferred to us?" I said, "Jiao Erniu." He looked a little disbelieving: "You're guessing wildly, it wouldn't be her turn among all the female workers in the mine! Haven't you thought about it? She's so short, she can't even reach the electric switch." Saying this, he still didn't quite believe it and said, "Let's go to the section to ask!"

    As soon as we entered the section chief's office, the section chief mentioned the matter of transferring an apprentice to us. Dingwu quickly asked, "Who's coming to our shift?" The section chief said, "Jiao Erniu." Dingwu paused and said, "Erniu is too short! Her hands can't reach the electric switch, and her feet can't reach the brake. How can that work?" The section chief said, "Try it for a couple of days." We walked out, and Dingwu muttered, "Try it for two days, who will be responsible if there's an accident?"

    The next morning, Erniu went to work happily. She greeted the masters first when she saw them at the construction site. Dingwu said, "Sit down and rest for a while. We'll see when the train comes."

    Before long, the train came and stopped at the coal yard. At this time, the electric shovel started. Erniu stared blankly, her face flushed. The train was full. I said, "Why is Erniu standing there?" Erniu said, "Goodness! I've never seen this thing before. You move that little thing and it spins around, what's going on?" Erniu asked in detail. From then on, Erniu always asked in such detail, and in less than half a month, she learned a lot. When Erniu saw the electric shovel, she always thought: How great would it be to try it out? But Dingwu didn't agree. He said, "Let's watch for a few more days."

    One day, I was operating the electric shovel, and Erniu whispered behind me, "Let me try it!" I said, "Have you figured it out?" I was also afraid of an accident. But then I thought, she came here to learn how to operate an electric shovel, right? If she's never allowed to learn, when will she ever learn? At this time, Erniu asked me again, "Can I try it? Brother Liankui!" I said, "Okay! Come on! I'll protect you from behind and watch the switch." I also said, "You have to be especially careful." Erniu said, "Okay." She opened two hooks, and I thought it was about right. Who knew that when she was opening vigorously, Dingwu came in. When he saw that it was Erniu opening it, he stood at the door with his mouth turned down, didn't say a word, and turned around and went out again.

    After I finished this trip, Dingwu called me aside and said, "Liankui, Erniu has only been learning for a few days, how can you let her open it? If there is an accident, you can't handle this mess!" I said, "She's here to study, she keeps asking to try, how can I say no?" Dingwu said again, "Let's ask Squad Leader Xiao tomorrow. If the squad leader wants her to open it, then it has nothing to do with us."

    After work that day, he found Squad Leader Xiao. Before we could ask him, the squad leader said first: "You two don't dare to let that little girl open it. When a novice was learning to open it yesterday, he almost pulled the electric shovel frame into the ditch." After Squad Leader Xiao finished speaking, he left. From then on, I didn't dare to let her open it again.

    Erniu also knew that we were afraid of accidents. She went to Director Xu and said, "Director Xu, please transfer me!" Director Xu asked, "What? You don't dare to open it?" Erniu said, "I dare to open it, but no one dares to take responsibility." Director Xu said, "No one dares to take responsibility? Okay, I'll find someone to take responsibility for you tomorrow, go back first."

    The next day, Party Branch Secretary Shang and Director Xu talked to Dingwu and me. Director Xu said, "How are your apprentices being taught?" Dingwu said, "How? She's only been here for twenty days." Secretary Shang said, "I heard that you are a little afraid to let them open it. Fear alone can't solve the problem! One of you is a party member and the other is a member of the Youth League. This is also a glorious task assigned to you by the party. If you teach them early, they will be able to contribute to the country sooner. Isn't that so?"

    After talking with the leaders, Dingwu was a little moved. He saw that Erniu didn't understand, so he asked questions, and usually wiped the machine, swept the floor, and carried water. He didn't let the master do any chores. In this way, he wanted to teach Erniu even more. I also thought of many ways to teach her. When Erniu was driving, one person watched the brake for her, and the other watched the handle for her. In just five days, Erniu skillfully mastered the technology of operating an electric shovel. Later, she opened it very well. Until last year, when the leaders sent her to Qinhuangdao Workers and Peasants' Accelerated Middle School to study, there was not a single accident, and later she was also named a model worker in the entire Li Ji Mine.

    [Note] Electric shovel - is a machine designed by engineers of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau to load coal onto trains, replacing manual basket loading.

    焦二妞
    焦作煤矿绞车司机　李莲桂
    焦二妞原来和父亲在李计矿选煤场当选煤工。每天抬着一百多斤重的大筐，太阳晒着，风雪吹打着，使她变成了红胖胖的小妞。
    1953年底，领导上决定调她去装火车，学开电扒。〔注〕她心中非常高兴，看见我就笑着说：“莲桂哥，今天许科长说，叫我去学开电扒啦。你可得好好教我！”我说：“那就不用说啦，老邻居哩。”
    后来我去街上玩，碰见了刘定武，他是我们那个电扒上的负责司机。定武看见我就笑着说：“明天要给咱调去个女工哩。你知道谁往咱那里调？”我说：“焦二妞。”他有些不相信的样子：“你胡猜，全矿的女工轮也轮不到她头上呀！你没想想，她个子那样矮，站到哪儿，连电门都摸不着。”说到这里，他还有些不信地说：“咱们到科里去问问去！”
    一进科长办公室，科长就提到要给我们调去个徒弟的事。定武忙问：“谁去俺那班？”科长说：“焦二妞。”定武停了一下说：“二妞个子太矮呀！手都摸不着电门，脚踩不着车闸，怎么会行？”科长说：“先干两天试试吧。”我们俩走出来，定武嘴里乱嘟噜：“试两天，试出事故来谁负责任？”
    第二天清早，二妞高高兴兴地去上班了。在工地她看见师傅们就先打招呼。定武说：“坐下歇歇吧，一会火车来了再看。”
    不大一会，火车开来了，在煤场停下来。这时候电扒开动了，二妞看着发呆，脸上一阵一阵的发红。火车装满了。我说：“二妞怎么站那儿不动呀？”二妞说：“好家伙！我长这么大没见过这东西。你手拿那一点，一动乱转圈，这是咋回事呀？”二妞细问起来了。从这以后每天二妞总是这样详细问，不到半月她就学会不少东西了。二妞看见电扒，心里总想：试开一下有多好呢？可是定武不答应，他说：“再看几天再说吧。”
    有一天我在那儿正开电扒，二妞在我背后轻声说：“叫我试开一下吧！”我说：“你看通啦吗？”我也害怕出事故。但又想到人家是来学开电扒的呀？一直不叫她学，她啥时候才会学会呢？这时二妞又问我：“叫我开开行不行呀？莲桂哥！”我说：“行！来吧！我在后面给你保住险，看住电门。”我又说：“你可得特别小心。”二妞说：“好吧。”她开了两钩，我看也差不多。谁知道她正开得起劲的时候，定武进来了。他一看是二妞开的，站在门口嘴咧了几咧，没吭一声扭头又出去了。
    等我扒完这趟车以后，定武就把我叫到一旁说：“莲桂，二妞才学几天，你咋叫她开起来？弄出事故，这个乱子你可弄不清！”我说：“她是来这儿学习的，她一直要求试试，我咋说不叫哩？”定武又说：“咱明天到肖班长那里问问，班长要叫她开，那和咱们就没关系啦。”
    当天下班就找到了肖班长。班长不等我们问他先说了：“你们俩可不敢叫那个小妞开，昨天有个新手学开的时候，差一点没把电扒架拉到道沟里。”肖班长说完就走了。从此我也不敢叫她再开啦。
    二妞也知道我们是怕出事故。她就去找许科长，她说：“许科长，你给俺调动工作吧！”许科长问：“怎么？不敢开吗？”二妞说：“敢开是敢开，就是没人敢负责任。”许科长说：“没人敢负责？好吧，明天给你找个负责的，先回去吧。”
    第二天党支部尚支书和许科长找定武和我去谈话。许科长说：“你们的徒弟教的咋样啦？”定武说：“咋样？才来二十天。”尚支书说：“我听说你们还有点不大胆叫开，光害怕不能解决问题呀！你们一个是党员，一个是团员，这也是党交给你们的光荣任务。把她们早日教会，她们就能早一天给国家出力，这是件好事情。你说是不是这样呀？”
    经过领导上谈话以后，定武有点心动了，他看二妞不懂就问，平常擦机器、扫地、提水，什么杂活都不叫师傅动手。这样一来就更想教二妞了。我也想了不少办法来教会她。在二妞开车的时候，一个人给她看车闸，一个人给她看手把。就这样没过五天的功夫，二妞就熟练地掌握了开电扒的技术。后来开的还非常好，一直到去年领导上送她去秦皇岛工农速成中学学习的时候，没有出过一次事故，后来还被评为李计矿全厂劳动模范了。
