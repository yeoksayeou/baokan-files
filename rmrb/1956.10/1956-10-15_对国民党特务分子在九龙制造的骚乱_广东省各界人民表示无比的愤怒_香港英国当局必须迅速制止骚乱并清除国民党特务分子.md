    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 14th. The bloody riots created by Kuomintang secret agents in Kowloon have aroused utmost indignation among the people of Guangdong Province.
    In recent days, people from all people's organizations, factories, shops, schools, and neighborhoods in Guangdong Province have been discussing the riot incidents in the Kowloon area. Responsible persons from people's organizations such as the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Guangdong Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, the Guangdong Provincial Democratic Youth Federation, and the Guangzhou City Student Federation have all made statements. They unanimously pointed out that Kuomintang secret agents have been killing, setting fires, looting factories and shops, and destroying schools and sanatoriums everywhere in the Kowloon area since the 10th, causing serious damage to the lives and property of our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, which is intolerable to the people of Guangdong and the people of the whole country.
    They also believe that the basic responsibility of the British authorities in Hong Kong is to swiftly stop the riots, ensure the safety of our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and eliminate Kuomintang secret agents from Hong Kong and Kowloon.
    Returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese also held a symposium. Liang Suhao, a returned overseas Chinese from the United States, said: "Many of our overseas Chinese and their relatives have relatives and friends and property in Hong Kong and Kowloon. As far as we know now, the Garden Confectionery and Biscuit Company, which was established with overseas Chinese investment, has also been attacked. We demand that the British authorities in Hong Kong immediately change their connivance at the atrocities committed by Kuomintang secret agents." Rong Huasheng, a relative of overseas Chinese, accused the British authorities in Hong Kong of placing many obstacles to our compatriots entering and leaving Hong Kong, while consistently condoning the sabotage carried out by Kuomintang secret agents. The symposium passed a telegram "regarding protesting against the irresponsible attitude of the British authorities in Hong Kong towards the lives and property of compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon."
    Thirty-eight alumni of Heung To Middle School at Sun Yat-sen University jointly wrote a letter to the "Southern Daily," stating: Our alma mater, Heung To Middle School, has also been attacked and set on fire by Kuomintang secret agent thugs. There is nothing more shameless than attacking schools. Kuomintang secret agents are like a group of hate-filled beasts, frantically pouncing on good people. This kind of crazy atrocity shows their fear before the end. We feel infinite indignation at this atrocity.

    对国民党特务分子在九龙制造的骚乱
    广东省各界人民表示无比的愤怒
    香港英国当局必须迅速制止骚乱并清除国民党特务分子
    新华社广州14日电　国民党特务分子在九龙制造流血骚乱，激起广东省人民无比的愤怒。
    这几天来，广东省各人民团体和许多工厂、商店、学校、里弄的人民纷纷议论九龙地区的骚乱事件。广东省工会联合会、广东省民主妇女联合会、广东省民主青年联合会和广州市学生联合会等人民团体的负责人都发表了谈话。他们一致指出，国民党特务分子从10日起在九龙地区到处杀人放火，抢劫工厂、商店，捣毁学校、疗养所，使港九同胞的生命财产遭到严重损失，这是广东人民和全国人民所不能容忍的。
    他们并认为，香港英国当局的起码的责任就是必须迅速制止骚乱，保证我港九同胞的安全，并将国民党特务分子从港九清除出去。
    归国华侨和侨眷也举行了座谈会。美国归侨梁速豪说：“我们华侨、侨眷有许多亲戚朋友和财产在港九。据现在所知，华侨投资开设的嘉顿糖果饼干公司也遭受袭击。我们要求香港英国当局立即改变对国民党特务分子行凶的纵容。”侨眷容华升指责香港英国当局一方面对我同胞出入香港诸多阻难，而对国民党特务进行破坏又一贯纵容。座谈会通过了“关于抗议香港英国当局对港九同胞生命财产采取不负责任的态度”的通电。
    在中山大学的香岛中学校友三十八人联名写给“南方日报”的信上写道：我们的母校——香岛中学也受到国民党特务暴徒的袭击和纵火。再没有比袭击学校更加无耻的了。国民党特务就像一群满怀仇恨的野兽，疯狂地扑向善良的人们。这种疯狂暴行正说明了他们在末日之前的恐惧。我们对这种暴行感到无限愤慨。
