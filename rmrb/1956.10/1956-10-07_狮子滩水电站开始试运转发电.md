    Shizitan Hydropower Station Begins Trial Operation and Power Generation
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The workers constructing the Shizitan Hydropower Station have fulfilled their guarantee to generate electricity before National Day this year and have recently begun trial operation and power generation.
    At 11:50 PM on October 1st, when the general commander of the Shizitan Hydropower Station Starting Committee of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry issued the starting order next to the generator, the first engine group immediately started up and generated the first current.
    In order to support the early completion of the Five-Year Plan by various factories and mines in Chongqing, the workers of the Shizitan Hydropower Station proposed a guarantee three months ago to generate electricity before National Day this year. At that time, the construction project of the power station was proceeding very intensely, and many important projects were originally expected to be completed only after National Day; however, with the active support of various departments, these projects were completed ahead of schedule in late September.
    Now, the preparations for the official power generation of the Shizitan Hydropower Station are being stepped up. The water diversion system and electromechanical equipment of the power station have been operating normally since the water filling test run began on September 27.

    狮子滩水电站开始试运转发电
    新华社讯　建设狮子滩水电站的职工实现了提前在今年国庆节发电的保证，最近开始试运转发电。
    10月1日晚上十一点五十分，当电力工业部狮子滩水电站起动委员会总指挥在发电机旁下达了起动命令以后，第一台发动机组立即开动起来，发出了第一股电流。
    狮子滩水电站的职工们为了支援重庆市各厂矿提前完成五年计划，在三个月以前提出了提前在今年国庆节发电的保证。那时候，电站的建设工程进行得十分紧张，许多重要工程原来预计都要等到国庆节以后才能完工；但是职工们在各个部门的积极支援下，这些工程在9月下旬就提前完成了。
    现在狮子滩水电站正式发电的准备工作，正在加紧进行。电站的引水系统和机电设备，从9月27日开始充水试运转以后，一切都很正常。
