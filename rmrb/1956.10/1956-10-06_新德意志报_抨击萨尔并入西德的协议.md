Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 5th. “Neues Deutschland” published a commentary on the 4th, attacking the agreement recently reached between Adenauer and Mollet regarding the incorporation of the Saar into West Germany. The newspaper wrote: This means that the Saar will be ravaged by militarists and SS personnel. The merger of the Saar territory, which possesses huge economic potential, will strengthen the power of the German monopolists who are trying to dominate Western Europe. The newspaper emphasized that there is no doubt that the residents of the Saar hope to be reunited with Germany, but it would be a distortion of the facts to say that they want to be dominated by politicians of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The newspaper wrote: "The Saar belongs to Germany, not to the Federal Republic or German imperialists. The Federal Republic cannot represent Germany alone. Therefore, the German people hope that unilateral agreements will not be concluded on the Saar territory issue."

    “新德意志报”抨击萨尔并入西德的协议
    据新华社柏林5日电　“新德意志报”4日发表评论，抨击阿登纳和摩勒最近达成的关于把萨尔并入西德的协议。报纸写道：这就意味着萨尔将受到军国主义分子和党卫军人员的蹂躏。合并拥有巨大经济潜力的萨尔领土会加强竭力想支配西欧的德国垄断资本家的力量。这家报纸强调指出，毫无疑问，萨尔居民是希望同德国重新合并的，可是，如果说他们希望受北大西洋公约组织的政客们支配，那就颠倒事实了。
    这家报纸写道：“萨尔是属于德国的，而不是属于联邦共和国或德国帝国主义分子的。联邦共和国不能单独代表德国。因此，德国人民期望不要就萨尔领土问题缔结单方面的协定。
