Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, October 18th: The Dongxiang Autonomous County in Gansu Province is building a telephone network in its mountainous areas. Engineering personnel from Lanzhou are working hard to erect lines across the mountains. They will complete the task of stringing more than 500 li of lines throughout the county in just over a month, so that every township in this autonomous county with its undulating mountains can have telephone access by the end of November.

The Dongxiang Autonomous County is an area characterized by high mountains, deep gullies, and particularly dispersed settlements, making transportation very inconvenient. Once the telephone network is completed, it will bring great convenience to the Dongxiang people in terms of work and communication in their lives.

    甘肃东乡族自治县
    架设山区电话网
    新华社兰州18日电　甘肃省东乡族自治县正在架设山区的电话网。来自兰州的工程人员，正在翻山越岭紧张地进行架线工作。他们将要在一个多月的时间内完成全县五百多里长的架线任务，使这个群山起伏的自治县在11月底就可以乡乡通电话。
    东乡族自治县是一个山大沟深、居住特别分散的地区，交通十分不便。电话网架通后，将给东乡族人民在工作和生活联系上带来很大便利。
