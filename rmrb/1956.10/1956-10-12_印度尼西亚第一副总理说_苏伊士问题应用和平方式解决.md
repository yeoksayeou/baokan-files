Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 11th - The Indonesian "People's Daily" reported today that First Deputy Prime Minister, Mohammed Roem, told a delegation of workers that the best and only way to resolve the Suez Canal issue is through peaceful means.

The worker delegation consisted of representatives from the Public Works Union, the Prison Staff Union, the Labor Department Union, and the Post and Telecommunications Workers Union. They wished to submit a statement to the government regarding the Suez Canal issue, requesting the government to take resolute action against the Netherlands for actively supporting Britain and France on the Suez Canal issue. The worker delegation believes that this can be achieved by seriously abolishing the Round Table Conference agreements.

The "Indonesian Torch" newspaper said today that Egypt's and the Soviet Union's proposals in the Security Council can serve as the basis for a reasonable and satisfactory resolution to the Suez Canal issue.

Britain, France, and the United States have claimed that because 90% of the ships passing through the canal belong to them, only they can decide which method is a good way to resolve the Suez Canal issue. Commenting on this argument, the newspaper pointed out: If the three countries stubbornly insist on their demands, the canal issue will not be resolved peacefully. The newspaper said that the opinions of Britain, France, and the United States give people the impression that there is no other way than international management or a solution by force.

    印度尼西亚第一副总理说
    苏伊士问题应用和平方式解决
    新华社雅加达11日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”今天报道，第一副总理穆罕默德·隆姆对一个工人代表团说，解决苏伊士运河问题最好的、唯一的方式是和平的方式。
    这个工人代表团由公共工程工会、监狱工作人员工会、劳工部工会和邮政及电信工人工会的代表们组成。它们要向政府递交关于苏伊士运河问题的声明，要求政府对在苏伊士运河问题上积极支持英国和法国的荷兰采取坚决的行动。工人代表团认为，这可以通过认真废除圆桌会议协定的办法实现。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”今天说，埃及和苏联在安全理事会的建议可以作为使苏伊士运河问题得到合理和圆满的解决的基础。
    英国、法国和美国曾经借口通过运河的船只有90％是它们的，声称只有它们才能够决定哪一种办法是解决苏伊士运河问题的好办法。这家报纸在评论这种论调的时候指出：如果三国执拗地坚持它们的要求，运河问题将不可能得到和平解决。这家报纸说，英国、法国和美国的意见给人们这样一种印象：除了国际管理或者以武力解决之外没有其他办法。
