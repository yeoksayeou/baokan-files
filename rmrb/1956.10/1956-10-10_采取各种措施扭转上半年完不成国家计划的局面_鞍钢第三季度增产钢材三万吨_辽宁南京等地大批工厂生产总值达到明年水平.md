Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 8th. Anshan Iron and Steel produced more than 32,000 tons of steel in the third quarter than the national plan. Steel production nearly doubled compared with the same period last year. The quality of steel has also improved significantly. The first-class rate of heavy rail reached 91.5% in September, an increase of 9.5% compared with July. The quantity of high-quality steel increased by 67% compared with the same period last year.

In the third quarter, Anshan Iron and Steel plants and mines took various measures to reverse the situation of not completing the national plan in the first half of the year. The primary rolling mill added new equipment such as cranes and ingot delivery locomotives, improved transportation work, and used large ingot molds to roll wide and thick slabs. Heating furnaces were added in the large rolling mill and medium plate plant, and some equipment was added and transformed in the medium and small rolling mills.

Rolling workers have learned new technologies, which has greatly improved the steel rolling capacity of the factory. The hourly output of the large rolling mill increased by 11.6% compared with the second quarter, and the medium and medium plate plants also increased by 20% compared with the second quarter.

New product trial production has also improved in the third quarter. More than 20 new products have been successfully trial-produced, including herringbone steel bars, boiler plates, alloy seamless steel pipes, cold-drawn steel pipes, high-quality thin plates, and prestressed steel wires.

This newspaper reports that among the 132 large state-owned factories of the eleven central industrial ministries in Liaoning Province, 75 factories have now reached the 1957 production value level. By the end of August, the total output value of state-owned industry in the province had reached 96.86% of the 1957 level.

The output of many major products also reached the 1957 planned targets by the end of August. These products are: metal cutting machine tools, double-wheel double-share plows, civilian ships, ammonium nitrate, caustic soda, automobile tires, pulp,麻袋,胶鞋, cotton cloth and cotton yarn, etc. Among these products, the output of metal cutting machine tools has reached 138.3% of the 1957 planned output level.

These factories have also achieved certain results in improving product quality. The scrap rate of the main components of the machine manufacturing industry—cast steel parts and cast iron parts—has been significantly reduced this year. The number of enterprises with a scrap rate of cast steel parts maintained below 5% has increased from 17% last year to 50%.

The broad masses of workers have displayed a high degree of enthusiasm in the struggle to comprehensively complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. In the first eight months of this year alone, workers have put forward more than 178,000 rationalization proposals, and have widely adopted new technologies and promoted advanced experiences.

This newspaper reports that workers in Lushun-Dalian City have made significant achievements in implementing the first Five-Year Plan. Now the comprehensive production value level of state-owned industry and local industry (including local state-owned, cooperative-operated, and joint state-private) in the city has reached and exceeded the 1957 production level 16 months ahead of schedule. The continuous improvement of the industrial production level has not only rapidly changed the face of Lushun-Dalian industry itself, but also increased the proportion of the value of production materials in the city's industry from 58.2% in 1952 to 67.3% in 1955.

Lushun-Dalian supports national construction with tens of thousands of mechanical products every year, and the variety and specifications are constantly increasing. Last year, more than 100 specifications of new products were successfully trial-produced. In recent years, Lushun-Dalian's chemical industry has also developed rapidly. Compared with 1952, the chemical fertilizer produced daily this year can sow 46,000 mu of wheat. Product quality has also improved. And it has accumulated a lot of funds for national construction. From 1953 to the first half of 1956, the profits turned over to the state can be used to build 25 large textile factories with 100,000 spindles each.

Xinhua News Agency reports that 53 factories in Nanjing City reached the total output value level of the last year of the first Five-Year Plan by the end of September ahead of schedule. The state-owned Nanjing Scientific Instrument Factory, which reached the 1957 production value level 20 months ahead of schedule, produced 109 kinds of teaching demonstrations and experimental instruments such as electrical, optical, mechanical, and acoustic instruments in three years and four months. The state-owned Nanjing Hydraulic Instrument Factory reached the 1957 total output value level one and a half years ahead of schedule. In three and a half years, this factory produced more than 50 kinds of hydraulic instruments to supply the needs of water conservancy construction throughout the country. The output of Yongli Ningchang's fertilizer powder, a joint state-private enterprise, reached the 1957 level in February this year.

    采取各种措施扭转上半年完不成国家计划的局面
　　鞍钢第三季度增产钢材三万吨
　　辽宁南京等地大批工厂生产总值达到明年水平
    新华社鞍山8日电　鞍钢在第三季度比国家计划多生产了三万两千多吨钢材。钢材产量比去年同期将近增加一倍。钢材的质量也有显著提高。重轨一级品率9月份达到91.5％。比7月份提高了9.5％。优质钢材的数量比去年同期增加了67％。
    在第三季度里，鞍钢各厂矿采取各种措施，扭转了上半年完不成国家计划的局面。初轧厂内增加了吊车、送锭机车等新设备，改进了运输工作，并且用大钢锭模轧制宽厚板坯。在大型轧钢厂和中板厂增加了加热炉，中型与小型轧钢厂增加和改造了一些设备。
    轧钢工人们学习了新的技术，使工厂轧钢能力提高得很快。大型轧钢厂每小时的产量比第二季度提高11.6％，中型和中板两个厂也比第二季度提高20％。
    新产品试制工作在第三季度也有了改进。试制成功的有：人字纹钢筋、锅炉板、合金无缝钢管、冷拔钢管、优质薄板、预应力钢线等二十多种新产品。
    本报讯　中央十一个工业部在辽宁省的一百三十二个大型国营工厂，目前已有七十五个工厂达到1957年生产总值水平。到8月末，全省国营工业已达到1957年总产值水平的96.86％。
    许多主要产品的产量到8月末也达到了1957年的计划指标。这些产品是：金属切削机床、双轮双铧犁、民用船舶、硝酸铵、烧碱、汽车外胎、纸浆、麻袋、胶鞋、棉布和棉纱等。在这些产品中，金属切削机床的产量已经达到1957年计划产量水平的138.3％。
    这些工厂在提高产品质量方面也取得了一定成绩。机器制造工业的主要部件——铸钢件和铸铁件的废品率，今年以来有较显著的降低。铸钢件废品率保持在5％以下的企业，已由去年的17％增加到50％。
    广大职工在争取提前全面完成五年计划的斗争中发挥了高度的积极性。只是在今年头八个月里，职工就提出了十七万八千多件合理化建议，并广泛地采用新技术，推行了先进经验。（辽宁日报编辑部）
    本报讯　旅大市工人在执行第一个五年计划中取得了重大的成就。现在全市国营工业和地方工业（包括地方国营、合作社营和公私合营）的综合生产总值水平，已提前十六个月达到和超过了1957年的生产水平。工业生产水平的不断提高，不但迅速改变着旅大工业本身的面貌，使生产资料的产值在全市工业中所占的比重，由1952年的58.2％，上升到1955年的67.3％。    旅大每年支援国家建设的机械产品数以万计，而且品种规格在不断增加，去年就试制成功了一百多种规格的新产品。几年来旅大化学工业也在飞跃发展，以今年和1952年相比较，今年每天多生产的化学肥料，就可播种四万六千亩小麦。产品质量也有了改善。并为国家建设积累了大量的资金。从1953年到1956年上半年，为国家上缴的利润就可新建二十五座拥有十万纱锭的大型纺织厂。
    新华社讯　南京市有五十三个工厂到9月底提前达到第一个五年计划最后一年的总产值水平。提前二十个月达到1957年生产总产值水平的国营南京科学仪器厂，在三年零四个月内生产了一百零九种电学、光学、力学、声学等教学演示和实验仪器。国营南京水工仪器厂提前一年半达到了1957年总产值的水平。这个厂在三年半中，生产了五十多种水工仪器供应全国各地的水利建设需要。公私合营永利宁厂肥田粉的产量，今年2月就达到了1957年的水平。
