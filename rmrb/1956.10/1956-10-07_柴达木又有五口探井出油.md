Xinhua News Agency Report by Peng Xue: In the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai Province, five more exploration wells have either gushed or flowed with crude oil. Adding to the original eight producing wells, there are now a total of thirteen wells gushing or flowing crude oil.

According to the oil testing results, it is certain that two exploration areas have industrial production value. The common characteristics of these two exploration areas are: shallow oil reservoirs, high pressure, capable of self-flowing, and low production costs. Test results prove that the gasoline content in the crude oil is higher than that of the Laojunmiao field. In addition, one deep exploration well has been drilled to the top of a deeper oil layer with greater oil storage potential, and four deep exploration wells have shown oil and gas indications.

The scale of oil drilling in the Qaidam Basin is constantly expanding. When the reporter was here in late June, there were only twenty-one large, medium, and small drilling rigs in operation; now, there are more than thirty drilling rigs conducting exploration, with deep and medium-deep drilling accounting for more than half. Auxiliary units serving the drilling rigs, such as hydroelectric power plants, repair shops, pipe stations, and water pipe installation teams, have also expanded significantly. Prefabricated and wood-structured assembled houses have been installed in batches.

The successive oil strikes in various exploration wells in the Qaidam Basin are inspiring all geological exploration personnel. They are working intensely with a selfless labor attitude, striving to make an early assessment of the oil reserves in the Qaidam Basin and to find oil fields with greater and better oil storage potential. The Drilling Department of the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau had already overfulfilled the drilling footage plan for the third quarter on September 23rd. Drilling Team 1209 has already begun preparing for work in 1957. The geological personnel have largely completed the first phase of detailed structural surveying and have begun moving to new areas.

### 柴达木又有五口探井出油

    柴达木又有五口探井出油
    新华社讯　新华社记者彭雪报道：青海省柴达木盆地又有五口探井喷出或流出原油；加上原来已经出油的八口井，现在共有十三口井喷出或流出原油。
    根据试油的情况来看，肯定有两个探区有工业生产价值。这两个探区的共同特点是：油藏浅、压力大，能够自喷，生产成本低；化验结果证明，原油中含汽油的成分都比老君庙的高。另外，还有一口深探井已经钻到储油希望更多的深油层顶部，有四口深探井有油气显示。
    柴达木盆地的石油钻探规模，正在不断地扩大着。当记者6月下旬在这里的时候，开钻的大、中、小型钻机，只有二十一部；现在，已经有三十多部钻机在进行钻探，其中深钻和中深钻占一半以上。为钻机服务的水电厂、修机厂、管子站、水管安装队等附属单位，也扩大了很多。活动房屋和木结构装配式房屋，已经成批地安装了起来。
    柴达木盆地各石油探井相继出油的消息，鼓舞着全体地质勘探人员。他们都以忘我劳动的姿态在紧张地工作着，争取要早日作出柴达木盆地的储油评价，找出储油希望更大更好的油田。青海石油勘探局钻井处，已经在9月23日提前完成了第三季度的钻井进尺计划；一二零九钻井队，已经开始在做1957年的工作；地质人员大部作完了第一阶段的构造细测工作，开始转入新的地区。
