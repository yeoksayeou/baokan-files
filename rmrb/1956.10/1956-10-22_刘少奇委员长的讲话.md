Chairman Liu Shaoqi's Speech

Respectable Head of Delegation, Ladies and Gentlemen:

The Indian Republic Parliamentary Delegation has been visiting our country for over three weeks and will be leaving Beijing tomorrow to return home. During this time, the delegation visited our country's industrial construction and agricultural production, toured our cities and villages, examined the living conditions of our people, and frankly exchanged views on various issues. This will greatly contribute to further enhancing understanding and strengthening friendship between China and India, I believe.

Both China and India are ancient yet young countries. In the past, we both waged long-term struggles for independence and freedom, and now we are both making unremitting efforts for peaceful construction. Therefore, the two countries need to help and learn from each other. We deeply admire the spirit of in-depth study of issues shown by all friends during their visit to our country, and we are very grateful for the many valuable opinions put forward. I believe that some of China's experiences can be used as a reference for you, and many of India's strengths are worth learning from by us. Head of Delegation, you have repeatedly expressed your desire for me to visit India. I myself would very much welcome the opportunity to see your country and learn from your experience.

Head of Delegation, you once said that you brought the friendship of 400 million Indian people to the Chinese people. Now I ask you to take the friendship of 600 million Chinese people back to the Indian people. The friendship between the one billion people of China and India is a great friendship, and the strength of the one billion people of China and India is a great strength. Our further unity and cooperation will make great contributions to national construction and world peace. We cherish this friendship very much.

Now I ask everyone to raise your glasses:

To the prosperity and happiness of China and India, to the freedom of all Asian countries, to world peace, and to the health of all friends! Cheers!

    刘少奇委员长的讲话尊敬的团长先生、女士们、先生们：
    印度共和国国会代表团在我国进行了三个多星期的访问，明天就要离开北京回国了。在这期间，代表团参观了我国的工业建设和农业生产，访问了我国的城市和乡村，考察了我国人民的生活状况，并就若干问题，同各方面坦率地交换了意见，这对进一步增进中印两国之间的了解，加强中印两国之间的友谊，我相信都有很大的作用。
    中印两国都是古老而又年青的国家，过去我们都为独立自由作过长期的斗争，现在我们都在为和平建设作着不懈的努力。因此，两国之间需要互相帮助，互相学习。各位朋友在访问我国期间深入研究问题的精神，我们十分钦佩，提出许多宝贵的意见，我们十分感谢。我认为中国的某些经验可供你们参考，印度的许多长处，值得我们学习。团长先生一再表示要我到印度进行访问，我本人是很欢迎看看你们的国家，学习你们的经验的。
    团长先生曾经说过，你们给中国人民带来了四亿印度人民的友谊，现在我请你们把六亿中国人民的友谊带回给印度人民。中印两国十亿人民的友谊是伟大的友谊，中印两国十亿人民的力量是伟大的力量。我们进一步团结合作起来，对国家的建设和世界的和平都会作出伟大的贡献。我们十分珍重这种友谊。
    现在我请大家举杯：为中印两国的繁荣幸福，为亚洲的各国自由，为世界和平，为各位朋友的健康干杯！
