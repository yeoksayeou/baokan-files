Xinhua News Agency, October 21st: Basic-level election work is being universally carried out in provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country. Provinces and cities where basic-level elections began earlier, such as Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, have successively elected people's representatives for basic-level units in September and October, and have convened the second session of the People's Congress of basic-level units.

Everywhere paid attention to integrating the elections with production. The proportion of voters participating in the election this year is relatively high. According to statistics from nine townships in Huishui County, Guizhou Province, the average number of participants in the election reached 92.8% of the total number of voters. Statistics from thirteen townships in Haidian District, Beijing, show that the average number of participants in the election accounted for 99.04% of the total number of voters. This year, many landlord elements who have changed their class status and counter-revolutionaries who have been leniently dealt with by the government and have gained political rights participated in the elections.

During the elections, many regions paid attention to fully promoting democracy and letting the masses examine government work and the work style of cadres. In various districts of Shenyang City, people's representatives were organized to report their work to the voters. The People's Committees of various districts and townships in Wuhan City organized people's representatives to visit voters and hold voter forums to listen to their opinions. In Luxia Township, Minhou County, Fujian Province, the process of consulting on representative candidates was combined with various forms like forums and small heart-to-heart talks, to extensively listen to the opinions of the masses. According to statistics from thirty-five basic-level units in eight provinces and cities, including Liaoning, Gansu, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, and Guangzhou, a total of 7,608 proposals were put forward during the elections, and these proposals have generally been properly handled. Relevant cadres have also made self-criticisms. In this way, not only have cadres and people's representatives received a profound democratic education, but government work has also been improved.

In this year's basic-level elections, representatives who are connected with the masses and supported by the masses have been re-elected. Some representatives with serious bureaucratic tendencies who do not care about the hardships of the masses failed to be re-elected in this election. This election also elected a group of new activists who emerged in the upsurge of the socialist revolution. According to a survey of twenty-two townships and towns in nine provinces, including Liaoning, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Shaanxi, a total of 992 representatives were elected this time, of which 475 were newly elected.

    全国各省、市和自治区普遍开展基层选举工作
    新华社21日讯　全国各省、市和自治区正普遍开展基层选举工作。基层选举进行得较早的辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、甘肃、青海、北京、天津、上海等省、市，都已在9月和10月先后选出了基层单位的人民代表，并召开了基层单位的第二届人民代表大会会议。
    各地在选举时，都注意和生产结合进行。今年参加选举的选民占选民总数的比例比较高。据贵州省惠水县九个乡的统计，参加选举的人数平均达到选民总数的92.8％；北京市海淀区十三个乡的统计，参加选举的人数平均占选民总数的99.04％。今年有许多已经改变成分的地主分子和已经被政府宽大处理而获得政治权利的反革命分子参加了选举。
    在选举中，许多地区都注意了充分发扬民主，放手让群众检查政府工作和干部作风。沈阳市各区，组织人民代表，向选民报告自己的工作。武汉市各区、乡人民委员会，组织人民代表访问选民、召开选民座谈会，听取选民的意见。福建省闽侯县胪下乡结合酝酿代表候选人，利用召开座谈会、小型谈心会等形式，广泛地听取群众的意见。据辽宁、甘肃、陕西、浙江、广州等八个省、市的三十五个基层单位的统计，在选举中共提出七千六百零八件提案，这些提案，一般都已得到了适当的处理。有关干部并且进行了检讨。这样，不仅使干部和人民代表都受到了一次深刻的民主教育，同时使政府工作有了改进。
    今年基层选举中，同群众有联系的、为群众所拥护的代表，都连选连任，有一些有严重的官僚主义、不关心群众疾苦的代表，在这次选举中落选了。这次选举还选出了一批社会主义革命高潮中涌现出来的新的积极分子。据辽宁、江苏、江西、陕西等九个省的二十二个乡、镇的调查，这次共选出代表九百九十二人，其中新当选的有四百七十五人。
