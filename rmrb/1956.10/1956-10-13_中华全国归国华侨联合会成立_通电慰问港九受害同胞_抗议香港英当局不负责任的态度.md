At today's meeting, the delegates also adopted the Constitution of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and passed resolutions on the working principles and basic tasks of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese.

The telegram to overseas Chinese stated: "All of us delegates attending the congress deeply miss you, extend our heartfelt respect for your contributions in supporting the socialist construction of the motherland abroad, expanding the great patriotic unity of overseas Chinese, and promoting the friendship between the people of various countries of residence and the Chinese people, and wish you further efforts."

Since the opening of the First Congress of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese on the 5th, the delegates have listened to Zhuang Xiquan's report on the current basic tasks of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and Zhuang Mingli's explanation on the draft constitution of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and held discussions.

The congress also received more than one hundred and fifty proposals of various kinds.

Today's congress concluded with a closing speech by Chen Jiageng. He said that although this congress has successfully concluded, it is not the end of our work, but the beginning of our work. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, we should work hard to unite the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese, families of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese around the motherland, and work together with the people of the whole country to build the socialist society of the motherland as soon as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, 12th. The First Committee of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese held its first plenary meeting at 3:00 pm today.

At the meeting, all the committee members were very indignant at the riotous events in Kowloon, in which Kuomintang special agents took advantage of the anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution to wantonly loot, burn, kill, and harm our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and expressed dissatisfaction with the British authorities in Hong Kong for failing to take effective measures to stop them in time. The committee members spoke one after another, expressing deep sympathy and condolences to the affected compatriots in Kowloon. Chen Jiageng said: The British authorities in Hong Kong neither prevented the atrocities of Kuomintang special agents in advance, nor did they stop them in time afterwards. We protest against the irresponsible attitude of the British authorities in Hong Kong towards the lives and property of our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon by condoning Kuomintang special agents.

At the suggestion of Chen Jiageng, the plenary meeting decided to send a telegram of condolences to the affected compatriots in Kowloon and a telegram of protest against the irresponsible attitude of the British authorities in Hong Kong towards the lives and property of compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon.
