    Some Questions Regarding the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain by Agricultural Cooperatives

    Editor's Note: After the State Council issued the "Regulations on the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain by Agricultural Production Cooperatives" on October 6th, some readers wrote to inquire about specific issues in the regulations. The following is a comprehensive response.

    Question: Why does the state adopt unified calculation and verification of the quantity of grain for unified purchase and sale based on the cooperative as a unit?

    Answer: The "Regulations on the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain by Agricultural Production Cooperatives" issued by the State Council stipulate that the state's quantity of grain for unified purchase and sale for agricultural cooperatives is generally calculated and verified uniformly on a cooperative basis. It also stipulates that the grain purchased by the state from surplus grain cooperatives should, in principle, be sold uniformly by the cooperative. As for the grain supplied by the state to grain-deficient cooperatives, it can be purchased collectively by the agricultural cooperative or purchased separately by the members, depending on the situation. This principle is fully adapted to the situation of unified production and unified distribution by agricultural cooperatives after agricultural collectivization. Implementing this principle will allow the state's grain unified purchase and sale work to shift from the basis of over 100 million individual farmers in the past to the basis of over one million agricultural cooperatives. This will both simplify the procedures for grain unified purchase and sale work in rural areas and facilitate unified grain distribution within agricultural cooperatives, making grain work more rational.

    Question: What are the principles for grain distribution within an agricultural cooperative?

    Answer: On the premise of guaranteeing the completion of the state's grain purchase task or without increasing the state's grain supply quota, agricultural cooperatives should first ensure the grain consumption within the cooperative and ensure that all members can receive the basic amount of grain needed. If the cooperative still has surplus grain, it can be distributed according to the amount of work points earned, so that members who work well can receive more grain.

    If the total value of a member's labor income and other income is not enough to exchange for the basic amount of grain that the agricultural cooperative should distribute to them, and they need to gradually purchase a portion of grain from future income, the agricultural cooperative can sell this portion of grain that the members cannot yet buy back to the state grain agency by selling revolving grain, and issue them revolving certificates, so that they can directly buy grain from the state grain agency in the future.

    Some people believe that the principle of grain distribution in agricultural cooperatives is "to each according to his work." Therefore, the grain produced by agricultural cooperatives should also be distributed entirely according to the amount of labor work points of the members. They oppose the principle of ensuring that all members can first obtain the basic amount of grain needed within the cooperative, and even oppose the principle of agricultural cooperatives first ensuring the completion of the state's grain purchase task. This is a one-sided understanding. The principle of distribution within agricultural cooperatives is "to each according to his work," which is beyond doubt. However, whether agricultural cooperatives have implemented this principle should be viewed from the total value of all income (in kind and cash) received by the members, and not just from one kind of in-kind object. Agricultural cooperatives should, in accordance with the provisions of the State Council, first ensure the completion of the state's task of purchasing grain, and then carry out reasonable distribution based on the basic needs of the members. From some practical situations, if some members receive too much grain (in kind), it will affect the grain income of other members in the cooperative, and they will have to purchase grain from the state at the unified sale price, which may affect the consolidation of the agricultural cooperative. At the same time, members who receive too much grain will have a lot of trouble if they take the surplus grain to the market to sell. A material from Yuci County, Shanxi Province, shows that if a member carries thirty kilograms of grain to a grain market thirty miles away to sell, the income is only about two yuan, but this results in one less working day (the wage for one working day locally is one yuan and seventy cents), and also requires spending more on meals.

    Question: How to understand the principle that the grain production and purchase figures will remain unchanged for three years from 1955?

    Answer: In this provision of the State Council, the grain production and purchase figures verified by the state in 1955 are reiterated, and the principle of no increase in purchase for increased production will remain unchanged for three years under normal harvest conditions. However, this year, because some areas have suffered relatively severe natural disasters, in order to support the disaster areas, the state can increase the purchase of some surplus grain from surplus grain cooperatives in grain-abundant areas, but the increased purchase quantity shall not exceed 40% of the increased production. In addition, if the grain production, purchase, and sale figures verified by households and cooperatives in 1955 are slightly too high or too low, no adjustments will be made this year under normal circumstances. As for the increased purchase methods, they shall be stipulated by the People's Committees of each province and autonomous region.

    Question: After agricultural cooperation, does the state still need to implement the "Three Fixes" policy for grain?

    Answer: Some people believe that the grain "Three Fixes" policy is a measure suitable for the small-scale peasant economy, and after agricultural cooperation, it has lost its role in stimulating farmers' enthusiasm for production. Others believe that after agricultural cooperation, grain production has increased a lot. If the grain "Three Fixes" policy is still implemented, farmers will have a lot of surplus grain flowing in large quantities on the market, which is not good. These understandings are one-sided. In the current situation, the basic principles of the grain "Three Fixes" have not lost their positive role. Because current agricultural production has not yet been able to get rid of the influence of natural conditions, and grain yield cannot increase a lot all at once; on the other hand, farmers still hope to be able to control a portion of surplus grain in order to develop some sideline production and raise some chickens, ducks, pigs, etc. The reason why agricultural cooperatives actively increase grain production is closely related to their not being afraid of the government implementing increased purchase for increased production. Of course, after the agricultural cooperatives increase production, the surplus grain controlled by farmers will increase, and the amount of grain circulating in the market will also expand. However, this is not a bad phenomenon, because this circulation is circulation in the grain market under the leadership of the state. At the same time, after agricultural cooperation, the main means of production are collectively owned, so rural capitalism has no room for rampant spread. On the contrary, as farmers control more surplus grain, the rural economy will become more active.

    有关农业社粮食统购统销的一些问题
    编者按　10月6日国务院发布“关于农业生产合作社粮食统购统销的规定”后，有些读者来信询问有关规定中的一些具体问题，现综合答复如下。
    问：国家对粮食统购统销的数量，为什么要采取以社为单位统一计算和核定？
    答：国务院“关于农业生产合作社粮食统购统销的规定”中，提出国家对农业社的粮食统购统销数量，一般的都以社为单位统一计算和核定，并规定国家向余粮社统购的粮食，原则上由社统一交售；至于国家向缺粮社供应的粮食，可以视不同情况，或者由农业社集体购买，或者由社员分散购买。这个原则，是与农业合作化后农业社集体生产统一分配的情况完全适应的。实行这个原则，国家的粮食统购统销工作，就可以从过去一亿多个个体农户的基础上，转移到一百多万个农业社的基础上来。这样做既可以简化农村粮食统购统销工作的手续，又便于农业社内统一进行粮食分配，使粮食工作做得更加合理。
    问：农业社进行社内粮食分配的原则是什么？
    答：农业社在保证完成国家粮食征购任务或者在不增加国家粮食供应指标的前提下，首先应该保证社内用粮和保证全体社员都能够分到基本需要的粮食；社内仍有余粮，可按照劳动工分的多少进行分配，使劳动好的社员能够多分到一些粮食。
    如果有的社员劳动所得和其他收入所得的总值，不能换取农业社应该分给他们基本需要数量的粮食，而需要从今后的收入中陆续购买一部分粮食的时候，可以由农业社以卖周转粮的办法，把社员暂时还不能买回的这部分粮食卖给国家粮食机构，并且换取周转证发给他们，他们以后直接向国家粮食机构买粮。
    有人认为农业社分配粮食的原则是“按劳取酬”，因此，农业社生产的粮食也应当完全按社员的劳动工分的多少进行分配。他们反对社内保证全体社员首先都能得到基本用粮的原则，甚至反对农业社首先保证完成国家粮食征购任务的原则。这是一种片面的认识。农业社进行社内分配的原则是“按劳取酬”，这是毫无异议的。但是，农业社是否贯彻执行了这个原则，应当从社员分得的全部收入的总值（实物和现金）上看，不能仅从某一种实物上去衡量。农业社应当按照国务院的规定，首先保证完成国家征购粮食的任务，再根据社员的基本需要来进行合理的分配。从一些实际情况看，一部分社员分得的粮食（实物）如果过多，会影响到社内其它社员的粮食所得，他们就要用统销价向国家购买粮食，因而就可能影响到农业社的巩固。同时粮食分得过多的社员如果自己拿余粮到市场上去出卖还要有很多麻烦。山西榆次县一个材料说明，如果社员背三十斤粮食到三十里以外的粮食市场上去出售，所得不过两元左右，但因此而少做一个劳动日（当地一个劳动日的工资是一元七角），并且还得多花一些饭费。
    问：如何理解粮食定产、定购数字自1955年起三年不变的原则？
    答：国务院的这项规定中，重申了1955年国家核定的粮食定产、定购数字，在年景正常的情况下三年不变增产不增购的原则。但是今年因为在若干地区遭受到比较严重的自然灾害，为了支援灾区，国家对粮食丰收地区的余粮社可以增购一部分余粮，但增购的数量不得超过增产部分的40％。此外，1955年分户、分社核定的粮食产购销数字略有偏高偏低的，在一般情况下，今年不做调整。至于增购办法，由各省、自治区人民委员会自行规定。
    问：农业合作化以后，国家是否还需要对粮食实行“三定”政策？
    答：有人认为粮食“三定”政策是适合小农经济的措施，农业合作化以后，它已失去刺激农民生产积极性的作用；有人则认为，农业合作化后粮食增产很多，如果仍实行粮食“三定”政策，农民就会有很多余粮在市场上大量通流，这是不好的。这些认识是片面的。就目前情况来说，粮食“三定”的基本原则，仍未失去它的积极作用。因为目前的农业生产还未能摆脱自然条件的影响，粮食产量还不可能一下增长很多；另一方面农民还希望自己能够掌握一部分多余的粮食，以便发展某些副业生产和增养一些鸡、鸭、猪等。农业社所以积极增加粮食生产，这与他们不怕政府对他们实行增产增购是有密切关系的。当然，农业社增产后，农民掌握的余粮会增多起来，市场的粮食流通量也会扩大。但是，这并不是不好的现象，因为这种流通是在国家领导的粮食市场上的流通，同时农业合作化后，主要生产资料已为集体所有，因此，农村资本主义已无泛滥的余地。相反的，由于农民掌握的余粮增多，农村经济将会更加活跃起来。
