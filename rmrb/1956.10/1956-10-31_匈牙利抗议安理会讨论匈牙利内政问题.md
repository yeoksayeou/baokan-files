Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 30th: Hungarian Representative to the United Nations, Peter Kos, wrote to the UN Secretary-General a few hours before the Security Council was scheduled to meet on October 28th to discuss the "situation" in Hungary, stating that the Security Council had no right to discuss Hungary's internal affairs.

Kos attached to his letter a declaration issued by the government of the Hungarian People's Republic on the same day, which stated:

"The government of the Hungarian People's Republic has learned that, on the suggestion of the United States, France, and Britain, the United Nations Security Council will convene a meeting on October 28, 1956, to consider issues related to the events in Hungary.

"Regarding the above situation, the government of the Hungarian People's Republic emphasizes that the events of October 22, 1956, and thereafter, and the measures taken in the course of these events, fall entirely within the internal jurisdiction of the Hungarian People's Republic and therefore do not fall within the jurisdiction of the United Nations. At the same time, the government of the Hungarian People's Republic wishes to emphasize that the internal events that have occurred in Hungary in the past few days have had no impact on international peace and security, and do not endanger the maintenance of international peace and security."

The declaration then cited the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 7 of Chapter I of the United Nations Charter, which states: "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter."

The declaration then emphasized: "The government of the Hungarian People's Republic resolutely protests the inclusion on the agenda of any consideration of issues concerning Hungarian internal affairs, because considering such issues in the United Nations would mean a serious violation of the sovereignty of the Hungarian People's Republic and would clearly contradict the principles stipulated in the United Nations Charter."

    匈牙利抗议安理会讨论匈牙利内政问题
    新华社30日讯　纽约消息：匈牙利驻联合国代表彼得·科什10月28日在安全理事会预定开会讨论匈牙利“局势”以前几小时写信给联合国秘书长，指出安全理事会无权讨论匈牙利的内政问题。
    科什在信中附上了匈牙利人民共和国政府当天发表的宣言，这个宣言说：
    “匈牙利人民共和国政府获悉，在美国、法国和英国的建议下，联合国安全理事会将在1956年10月28日召开会议来考虑有关匈牙利事件的问题。
    “关于上述情况，匈牙利人民共和国政府强调指出，1956年10月22日和其后发生的事件以及发生这些事件的过程中所采取的措施，完全是在匈牙利人民共和国内部管辖职权以内的，因此并不属于联合国管辖职权之内。同时，匈牙利人民共和国政府希望强调指出，匈牙利在前几天发生的内部事件对国际和平和安全没有任何影响，而且并不危及国际和平和安全的维护。”
    宣言接着援引了联合国宪章第一章第二条第七段的规定，这一段说：“本宪章不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件，并且不要求会员国将该项事件依本宪章提请解决。”
    宣言然后强调说：“匈牙利人民共和国政府断然抗议把对任何关于匈牙利内政的问题的考虑列入议程，因为在联合国中考虑这种问题将意味着严重侵犯匈牙利人民共和国的主权，并且将显然是和联合国宪章规定的原则相矛盾的。”
