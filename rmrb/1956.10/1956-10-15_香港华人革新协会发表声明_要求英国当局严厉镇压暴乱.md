Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 14th: Hong Kong News: The Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association issued a statement on the 13th regarding the riots created by Kuomintang special agents in Kowloon. The statement put forward five demands to the British authorities in Hong Kong:

	I. Severely suppress the riots and stop the continued development of atrocities;
	II. Take responsibility and effectively protect the lives and property of residents;
	III. Arrest the rioters and severely punish the masterminds;
	IV. Learn from the lesson of nurturing a malignant tumor, and clear out the thugs and so-called "refugees" who commit crimes;
	V. Provide appropriate post-disaster assistance to factories, shops, and schools affected by the disaster.

The statement said: "The riots that occurred in the Kowloon area on October 10th continued for three days and three nights, from Sham Shui Po Office to Tsuen Wan, resulting in inhumane and lawless incidents of arson, looting, rape, and murder, which are hateful and outrageous."

The statement pointed out that all facts and all available information indicate that the rioting was organized, planned, directed, and manipulated. This incident did not happen by chance.

After listing the various atrocities committed by the rioters in three days, the statement said: "All of this irrefutably proves that these were atrocities organized by Kuomintang special agents." The statement believes that, under these circumstances, it is imperative that the Hong Kong authorities take strict and effective measures to suppress the rioters without delay.

    香港华人革新协会发表声明
    要求英国当局严厉镇压暴乱
    新华社广州14日电　香港消息：香港华人革新协会13日就国民党特务分子在九龙制造骚乱的事件发表一项声明。声明中向香港英国当局提出了五点要求：
    一、严厉镇压暴乱，制止暴行继续发展；
    二、负起责任，切实保护居民生命财产；
    三、逮捕暴乱分子，严惩祸首；
    四、应引养痈为患之戒，把暴徒及为非作歹之所谓“难民”清除出去；
    五、对被祸之工厂、商店与学校，应给予适当善后处理。
    声明说：“此次九龙地区在10月10日所发生之暴乱，续至三日三夜，深水埗办事处至荃湾，做成焚烧、劫掠、奸淫、残杀的惨无人道、无法无天的事件，令人痛恨，实堪发指”。
    声明指出，一切事实，一切所可能掌握到的资料，都在指明，这次暴乱的行为是在有组织、有计划、有人发号施令、有人操纵底下进行的。这次事件不是偶然发生的。
    声明在列举暴徒三天内所制造的各种暴行事实之后说：“这一切都不容置辩地证明这是国民党特务分子们组织的暴行”。声明认为，在这种情形下，香港当局采取严厉有效措施，镇压暴乱分子，实不容稍缓。
