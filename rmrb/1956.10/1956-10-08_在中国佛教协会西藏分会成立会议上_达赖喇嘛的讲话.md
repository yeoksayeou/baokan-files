According to the decision of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Religious Affairs Committee is responsible for preparing for the establishment of the Tibetan Branch of the Chinese Buddhist Association. The preparations are now complete, and it is officially established today. I extend my heartfelt congratulations.

Since Songtsen Gampo sent Thonmi Sambhota to India to study and return to Tibet, Buddhism began in Tibet. During the time of Trisong Detsen, many eminent monks and virtuous masters, headed by Padmasambhava and Śāntarakṣita, were invited to establish the Sangha. Twenty-five Tibetan monks began to promote Buddhism. During the time of Tri Ralpachen, all the Buddhist scriptures were translated into the Tripitaka, and Tibetan Buddhism began to shine like the sun. Subsequently, Tibetan Buddhism entered a period of decline. The Tibetan kings Bodhi Light and Wisdom Light spared no effort to sacrifice their lives, and worked tirelessly to firmly maintain Buddhism. Atisha was invited from India to Tibet to revise Buddhism according to the spirit of exoteric and esoteric teachings. Subsequently, Kyo Lotsawa, Ngok Lotsawa, Dro Lotsawa, Marpa, Milarepa, Gampopa, and the Sakya Five Patriarchs and the various sects of the old Kadam and Kagyu schools, such as the Four Great and Eight Minor schools, and Sakya, Gelug, and Jonang, promoted Buddhism and benefited all beings. After Tsongkhapa was born, he spread the teachings of the Gelug school throughout Tibet. Until now, all the pure Buddhist teachings of the old schools, Kagyu, Gelug, etc., are like refined gold, and have been passed down without weakening. In the Wei Molungren area of Xiangdui, a Xingrao Miwo was born. He obtained foreknowledge and great Dharma power. The Sordrak teachings he propagated continue to be popular.

Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the leader of all ethnic groups in China, Tibet's politics, economy, and culture are developing. Now, with the establishment of the Tibetan Buddhist Association, which includes all sects, all Buddhist believers, both lay and monastic, who believe in various sects in the world, will be united like milk and water. All the temples and Sangha will be in close harmony, abide by the precepts, and lecture and practice in order to uphold and spread the root of the supreme benefit of all sentient beings, the Dharma and teachings of the Tathagata throughout the world. In particular, I hope that everyone can correctly and thoroughly implement the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao's policy of freedom of religious belief, love the great motherland, and support and pray for lasting world peace. Finally,

    在中国佛教协会西藏分会成立会议上
    达赖喇嘛的讲话
    根据西藏自治区筹备委员会的决定，由宗教事务委员会负责筹备中国佛教协会西藏分会，现已筹备就绪，今天正式成立，我谨致以衷心的祝贺。
    西藏从松赞干布派遣吐米桑布扎赴印度求学回藏以后，开始有了佛教，到了池松德赞的时候，迎请了以莲花生和静命论师等为首的许多高僧大德，成立了僧团，二十五位藏族僧侣，开始宏扬佛教。池热巴金时，把全部佛经，译成三藏，西藏佛法开始放出像太阳一般的光辉。随后，西藏佛教转入衰微的时期，西藏国王菩提光和智慧光，不惜牺牲自己的生命，不辞劳苦，坚决保持佛教，自印度迎请阿底峡，前来西藏，按照显教和密宗的精神，修正佛法，先后出生了枯译师、俄译师，仲译师，麻巴，弥拉热巴，达波拉杰，以及萨覃王祖等旧教，噶当、噶举宗的四大八小派，和萨迦，?杰，决宇等各种宗派，宏扬了佛法，利益了众生。到了宗喀巴出世以后，把噶丹派的教义，传播到整个西藏。直到现在为止，所有一切旧教，噶举，噶丹等纯洁的佛法，有如经过冶炼的真金一样，流传未衰。在向椎的畏莫隆仁地方曾经出生了一个兴饶迷阿，他得到了先知神通和很大的法力，从他传播出来的有所谍里教，现在还继续流行。
    在中国各民族领袖毛主席的正确领导下，西藏的政治、经济、文化各方面都在向前发展，现在又成立了包括一切宗派的西藏佛教协会，要将使世界上一切信仰各种宗派的在家和出家的佛教徒们，像水乳交融一样团结一致，使所有的寺庙僧团，亲密和睦，谨守戒律，为了在全世界住持和传播一切众生无上利益的根本，如来的证法和教法而讲经修行，特别希望大家能够正确地彻底执行中国共产党，毛主席的信教自由政策，热爱伟大的祖国，拥护和祈祷世界的持久和平。最后，让我们发愿：
    全世界佛教昌隆万岁！
    中国各民族人民大团结万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国各民族人民伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
