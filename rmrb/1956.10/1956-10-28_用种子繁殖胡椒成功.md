　　Haikou Electric Dispatch from our Newspaper: Pepper, which was previously considered difficult to propagate from seeds, has now been successfully propagated in Hainan Island. The first batch of pepper seedlings cultivated from seeds is growing vigorously. By the end of this year, it will be possible to continue cultivating seedlings to 20,000 plants, sufficient for planting 120 mu of pepper.

　　In the past, seed propagation of pepper had failed in numerous trials across Hainan. This time, Zheng Hongshu, a returned overseas Chinese from Qiongdong County, with the assistance of the government, after more than three months of unremitting experimentation, finally discovered that using freshly picked pepper fruits, removing the outer skin, washing and sowing them, and using "nutrient pots" made from a mixture of burnt soil and compost as seedbeds, the germination rate finally reached over 80%.

　　Pepper is a precious tropical spice crop with a high yield per unit area, and it can be harvested two and a half years after planting. Assuming a general annual yield of 300 jin of white pepper per mu (150 plants), it can generate an income of 2,100 yuan, equivalent to the income from 30,000 jin of rice. Harvesting can continue for fifteen years. Hainan is located in the subtropics, with a hot and humid climate, suitable for growing this crop.

    用种子繁殖胡椒成功
    本报海口电　过去被人认为难以用种子繁殖的胡椒，现在海南岛已经繁殖成功。第一批用种子育出的胡椒幼苗，生势壮旺。到今年底，将可继续育苗到二万株，足供定植一百二十亩胡椒之用。
    胡椒用种子育苗，过去在海南各地经过多次试验都失败了。这次琼东县归国华侨郑宏书在政府的帮助下，经过三个多月来不懈地试验，最后研究出采用刚摘下的胡椒果剥除外皮洗涤播种，并用火烧土和堆肥混合制成的“营养盆”作苗床，发芽率终于达到80％以上。
    胡椒是珍贵的热带香料作物，单位面积产量很高，定植后二年半就可收获。以每亩（一百五十株）一般年产白胡椒三百斤计，可收入在二千一百元，相当于三万斤稻谷的收入。可连续收获十五年。海南地处亚热带，气候高温多湿，适宜种植这种作物。
