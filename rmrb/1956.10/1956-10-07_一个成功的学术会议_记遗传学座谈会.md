    A Successful Academic Conference
    ——Notes on the Genetics Symposium
    Huang Qinghe Huang Shun'e

    Not long ago, we attended the Genetics Symposium jointly convened by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Higher Education in Qingdao. In addition to geneticists from the Michurin and Morgan schools, the meeting was attended by geneticists holding other views and experts from other disciplines related to genetics. This conference was the first large-scale academic debate in natural sciences after the "Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy was proposed. This debate on genetics issues fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the scientists present and strengthened their confidence in catching up with the international level of genetics within twelve years.

    Genetics is a basic discipline of biology, which has close relationships with many other disciplines in biology and with many disciplines in agronomy and medicine. The debate between the Michurin-Lysenko school and the Morgan school of genetics has a history of twenty years. Before the national liberation, the vast majority of Chinese biologists were from the Morgan school. Since the national liberation, many scientists from the Morgan school have changed their views after studying Michurin's theory; and many scientists from the Morgan school still adhere to their original views. In the past few years, when introducing Michurin's theory, incorrect and comprehensive negation of Morgan's theory was adopted, and the research and teaching work of Morgan's theory almost completely stagnated.

    Since the end of 1952, the discussion of species and speciation and other issues in biology by Soviet biologists has attracted the attention of Chinese biologists. After the "Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy was proposed, biologists raised many urgent questions that needed to be clarified: How should Michurin's theory and Morgan's theory be treated? How should genetics research and teaching be carried out, and so on?

    The scientists attending the symposium felt that it was very timely to hold this symposium under such circumstances.

    At the symposium, the two schools introduced their recent research results. In recent years, some views of the Morgan school have been developed. In the past, the Morgan school believed that the inheritance of the characteristics and traits of organisms was governed by a special genetic material—genes, and genes were genetic units arranged linearly on chromosomes in the nucleus. Recently, the Morgan school has determined the chemical composition of genetic material and found that this substance also exists in the cytoplasm, but cytoplasmic inheritance is not as important as nuclear inheritance. Geneticists of the Michurin school also introduced experimental results such as asexual hybridization of tomatoes and the transformation of spring wheat into winter wheat to prove the views of the Michurin school.

    When discussing these issues, the most intense debates were about genetic material and the influence of the environment on the heredity of organisms.

    The problem of the existence of special genetic material in cells was put forward by the Morgan school. Based on asexual hybridization experiments, the Michurin school believes that in the case of grafting, no chromosome transfer occurs, but heredity has changed, which proves that every living part of the organism has heredity, and there is no special genetic material. However, scientists from the Morgan school believe that this experiment does not exclude the possibility of other explanations for the experimental results, and therefore cannot deny the existence of special genetic material.

    Many people expressed a third view. They believe that chromosomes are the main genetic material, but the Morgan school overemphasizes the role of chromosomes and does not pay enough attention to cytoplasmic inheritance; while the Michurin school overemphasizes that every living part of the cell has heredity, ignores the division of labor within the cell, and denies the special role of chromosomes. These are all one-sided. Some people think that genes are a good stepping stone to explain phenomena, but gene theory has limitations. Experimental embryologists also believe that there are many phenomena, such as the symmetry of animal body shapes and the determination of the central axis, which cannot be explained by genes. They believe that in the early stages of embryonic development, the cytoplasm plays a major role rather than the nucleus. For example, if half of the cytoplasm of a goldfish egg is cut off, then half of the egg with the nucleus cannot develop into a goldfish.

    The focus of the debate on the influence of the environment on heredity is the problem of whether acquired traits can be inherited, that is, whether the variations of organisms caused by changed environmental conditions can be inherited by offspring. The Michurin school believes that if this variation affects the reproductive system, then this variation can be inherited. Scientists from the Michurin school reported on the experimental results of the transformation of spring wheat into winter wheat at the meeting to prove that acquired traits can be inherited. The Morgan school believes that general living conditions can only diversify the external manifestations of organisms, but cannot change their inherent genetic nature. The Morgan school believes that only after using physical factors with strong stimulating effects (such as X-rays, cosmic rays, etc.) and chemical factors (such as colchicine, mustard gas, etc.) to cause changes in the genetic material inside the biological cell can inheritable variations be obtained.

    In the past, Lysenko believed that the method of treatment with strong physical and chemical factors would only harm organisms and only occasionally obtain beneficial results. This method is not a progressive scientific method. In the discussion, many people believed that Lysenko was wrong to reject this method of obtaining beneficial variations as a reliance on chance. Using this method, many achievements have been made both at home and abroad. Some scientists from the Michurin school also believe that the method of treating organisms with strong factors should not be excluded in scientific research.

    Geneticists from the Morgan school admitted during the discussion that the phenomenon of acquired inheritance exists in microorganisms; in higher animals and plants, acquired inheritance may be possible, but there is currently no sufficient scientific evidence to prove it. They believe that the experiment of transforming spring wheat into winter wheat can have other explanations and cannot be used to prove the inheritance of acquired traits. Some scientists believe that there are few examples of acquired traits that can be inherited and many examples of acquired traits that cannot be inherited. This issue cannot be concluded at present.

    After discussing these two issues, some scientists believed that the views of the two schools have gradually become closer. For example, in the past, the Morgan school denied that cytoplasm was related to heredity, but now they admit it, which is close to the Michurin school's view that every living part of the cell has heredity; and, for example, the Morgan school completely denied that acquired traits could be inherited in the past, but now they admit that acquired traits can be inherited in some microorganisms, and so on. However, many people oppose this view, believing that this view is far-fetched, because the theoretical basis and ideological system of the two schools are completely different when making these assertions.

    The symposium also discussed the problems of individual development and systemic development in heredity.

    In this debate, neither side was able to convince the other with scientific facts. The symposium did not draw conclusions on the controversial issues.

    One of the characteristics of this symposium was that the scientists of the Morgan school, encouraged by the "Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy, said what they had not said for several years. Before this, the widely popular views that Morganism was "reactionary" and "bourgeois" hindered scientists from fully expressing their academic opinions. At this meeting, everyone agreed with this view: political issues and academic issues should be separated.

    Under such circumstances, many scientists of the Morgan school unreservedly expressed their opinions, and some people spoke ten times to defend their academic views. In this symposium, the attitude of the vast majority of scientists was serious, and the debates were based on facts.

    Individual scientists from the Morgan school once requested the conference to draw the conclusion that China's genetics should develop in the direction of the Morgan school, believing that only by adopting the methods of Morganism can China catch up with the international level of genetics within twelve years; and that only the cell genetics of the Morgan school should be taught in universities, and so on. These views were opposed by other scientists, including some scientists from the Morgan school, who believed that this was inconsistent with the spirit of "Hundred Flowers Bloom" and inconsistent with the actual situation.

    After two weeks of debate, most scientists felt that genetics is a very complex but relatively young science, and many important issues have not yet been clarified. No school should think that it has reached the peak of genetics. They believe that the Morgan school has adopted the method of analyzing genetic factors in genetic research, accumulated a lot of facts, and revealed some genetic laws, which has contributed to genetics, but the research materials and research methods of the Morgan school are limited to a relatively narrow range, and it only studies a part of the laws in genetics; the Michurin school puts forward some basic principles that are correct from the perspective of the interrelationship between organisms and the environment and the organism as a whole, and some scientific facts that have been accumulated are valuable. The Michurin school has a closer connection with practice, but the experimental results accumulated by the Michurin school are not very sufficient, and the way some problems are raised is also too general and absolute.

    Most of the scientists attending the conference believe that the idea of ​​"one school dominating" is harmful to the development of genetic science, and geneticists with various different views should humbly listen to opinions from all sides. Most of the geneticists of the Michurin school in China have studied or researched Morgan's theory in the past, and most of the geneticists of the Morgan school have also studied or researched Michurin's theory after liberation, so the conditions for mutual learning are available. This discussion increased mutual understanding. At the meeting, some scientists from the Michurin school have expressed that they will pay more attention to experimental techniques and conduct in-depth research in their future work, and some scientists from the Morgan school have also expressed that they will break out of the narrow circle of the past and pay attention to linking with reality in the future.

    The symposium suggested that the Chinese Academy of Sciences establish a Genetics Academic Committee to guide and coordinate the national genetics research work; it suggested the establishment of a Genetics Research Institute as the center of China's genetics research. Some scientists also believe that genetics research laboratories should also be established in qualified universities and relevant research institutes of agricultural and forestry departments to strengthen genetics research in all aspects.

    The meeting believed that relevant scientific research institutions and universities should, in the spirit of "Hundred Flowers Bloom," ensure that all schools have equal opportunities for development and equal conditions for conducting scientific research; in a research institution or university, scientists in a minority position should be guaranteed the freedom to adhere to their academic views, and should be guaranteed equal rights in conducting scientific research and publishing academic papers. Only in this way can it be conducive to the faster development of China's genetics, so that it can catch up with or approach the advanced scientific level in the world within twelve years.

    When talking about the development of China's genetics, many scientists believe that attention must be paid to the combination of genetics and certain related disciplines, such as cytology, developmental physiology, biochemistry, biophysics, biostatistics, and experimental embryology.

    Many scientists believe that preparations should be started for publishing the Journal of Genetics and ensuring that scientists of different schools have equal rights to publish scientific works in the journal.

    Strengthening the introduction of foreign genetics literature is a consistent proposition of the scientists present. At present, many important works of the Morgan school have not been translated and published in China; the introduction of the literature of the Michurin school is also not comprehensive. In the past few years, most of the works of the Lysenko school have been introduced, and the works of other schools in the Michurin direction have been rarely introduced, so it has been mistakenly believed that the views of the Lysenko school are the entire content of Michurin's theory. Many scientists have put forward suggestions on publishing genetics translations to timely introduce the achievements of various schools abroad.

    When discussing the issue of genetics teaching in universities, most scientists believe that in order to train young scientific cadres with modern genetics levels, the main views of the two schools must be introduced to students in universities. Regarding issues such as curriculum settings, some advocated introducing the views of the two schools in one genetics course. As for whether the views of the Michurin school should be the main focus or the views of the Morgan school should be the main focus, there were two opposing opinions. Others believe that it is difficult to teach the views of the two schools in one course immediately, and two genetics courses can be temporarily opened to teach the views of the two schools separately, and then merged into one course at a certain time. Many scientists believe that due to the different nature of schools and the different tasks of majors, the situation of teachers and teaching equipment in each school is also different, so it is not necessary to make uniform regulations in the most recent academic year.

    Regarding the issue of genetics teaching, many scientists also believe that courses such as cytology, biostatistics, and field technology, which are closely related to genetics, should also be taught in universities.

    Regarding scientific research and teaching work issues, the meeting suggested that the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Higher Education, and the Ministry of Education make decisions based on the opinions of the scientists at the meeting.

    This symposium will play a good role in promoting the development of China's genetics. The scientists at the meeting all expressed that they will strengthen scientific research work under the guidance of dialectical materialism and strive to make China's genetics catch up with the international level within twelve years. It is believable that at the next genetics academic conference, Chinese geneticists will definitely put forward more and more valuable research results.

    一个成功的学术会议
    ——记遗传学座谈会
    黄青禾　黄舜娥
    不久以前，我们旁听了中国科学院和高等教育部在青岛联合召开的遗传学座谈会。参加这次会议的除了有米丘林学派和摩尔根学派的遗传学家以外，还有持有其他观点的遗传学家和与遗传学有关的其他学科的专家。这次会议是在“百家争鸣”方针提出以后在自然科学中第一次较大规模的学术论争。这次遗传学问题的论争，充分发挥了到会科学家的积极性和加强了在十二年内赶上遗传学的国际水平的信心。
    遗传学是生物学的一个基本学科，它同生物学中其他许多学科，同农学、医学中的许多学科都有密切的关系。遗传学中米丘林、李森科学派和摩尔根学派间的争论，已经有二十年的历史了。我国生物学家在全国解放以前，绝大多数都是摩尔根学派的。全国解放以来，不少摩尔根学派的科学家在学习了米丘林学说以后，改变了自己的观点；也有不少摩尔根学派的科学家仍旧坚持原先的观点。这几年中，在介绍米丘林学说的时候，曾经对摩尔根学说采取了不正确的全盘否定的做法，摩尔根学说的研究和教学工作也几乎完全停顿了。
    从1952年底起，苏联生物学家关于物种和物种形成问题和生物学中其他问题的讨论，引起了我国生物学家的注意。在“百家争鸣”的方针提出以后，生物学家产生了许多迫切要求明确的问题：应当怎样对待米丘林学说和摩尔根学说？遗传学的研究和教学工作应当怎样进行等等。
    参加座谈会的科学家都感到，在这种情况下召开这次座谈会是很及时的。
    在座谈会上，两个学派分别介绍了最近的研究结果。最近几年以来，摩尔根学派的一些观点已经有了发展。过去，摩尔根学派认为生物体的特性和性状的遗传，受一种特殊的遗传物质——基因所支配，基因是成直线状排列在细胞核内染色体上的遗传单位。最近，摩尔根学派确定了遗传物质的化学成分，并发现在细胞质中也有这种物质，但细胞质遗传不如细胞核遗传重要。米丘林学派的遗传学家也介绍了番茄的无性杂交和春麦转变成冬麦等试验结果，来证实米丘林学派的观点。
    在对这些问题进行讨论时，争论最激烈的是关于遗传物质和环境对有机体遗传性的影响等问题。
    在细胞中存在特殊遗传物质的问题是摩尔根学派提出来的。米丘林学派根据无性杂交试验，认为在嫁接的情况下，没有发生染色体的传递，而遗传性发生了变异，这证明了生物体中的每一个有生命的部分都具有遗传性，不存在特殊的遗传物质。但是，摩尔根学派的科学家认为这个试验并没有排除对试验结果作其他解释的可能，不能因此就否定特殊遗传物质的存在。
    有许多人表示了第三种看法。他们认为染色体是主要的遗传物质，但是摩尔根学派过分强调染色体的作用，对细胞质遗传注意不够；而米丘林学派则过分强调细胞的每一个有生命的部分都有遗传性，忽视细胞内部各部分的分工和否定染色体的特殊作用，这些都是片面的。有人认为基因是解释现象的很好的阶梯，但是基因学说有局限性。实验胚胎学家也认为有许多现象，如动物体形的对称以及中轴的决定等，是不能用基因来解释的。他们认为在胚胎发育初期起主要作用的是细胞质而不是细胞核，例如把金鱼的受精卵切去一半细胞质，那么具有细胞核的一半受精卵就不能发育成为金鱼。
    环境对遗传性影响问题的争论焦点是获得性能不能遗传的问题，即由改变了的环境条件引起的生物体的变异能不能遗传给后代的问题。米丘林学派认为，如果这种变异影响到生殖系统，那么这种变异是可以遗传的。米丘林学派的科学家在会上报告了春麦转变成冬麦的试验结果，来证明获得性可以遗传。摩尔根学派则认为一般生活条件只能使生物体的外部表现多样化，但是不能改变内在的遗传本性。摩尔根学派认为只有用具有强烈刺激作用的物理因素（如爱克司射线、宇宙射线等）和化学因素（如秋水仙精、芥子气等）引起生物细胞内部的遗传物质发生变化以后，才能得到可遗传的变异。
    过去，李森科曾经认为用强烈的物理、化学因素处理的方法，只会残害生物体，只是偶然地才能得到有益的结果。这种方法，不是进步科学的方法。在讨论中，许多人认为，李森科把这种获得有益变异的方法当作对偶然性的依赖而加以排斥是错误的。利用这种方法，在国内外都已经得到不少成绩。一些米丘林学派的科学家也认为，不应当排斥在科学研究中利用强烈因素处理生物体的方法。
    摩尔根学派的遗传学家在讨论时承认，在微生物中存在获得性遗传的现象；在高等动植物中，获得性遗传或许是可能的，但是目前没有充分的科学事实可以证明。他们认为，春麦转变成冬麦的试验，可以有别的解释，它不能用来证明获得性的遗传。有的科学家则认为获得性可以遗传的例子少而不遗传的例子多，这个问题目前不能作结论。
    讨论了这两个问题以后，有些科学家认为，两个学派的观点已经逐渐接近了。如过去摩尔根学派否认细胞质和遗传有关，现在承认了，这和米丘林学派的细胞中每一有生命的部分都有遗传性的看法是接近了；又如摩尔根学派过去完全不承认获得性可以遗传，而现在承认在某些微生物中获得性可以遗传等等。但是也有不少人反对这种看法，认为这种看法是牵强的，因为两个学派在作出这些论断时的理论根据和思想体系是完全不同的。
    座谈会还讨论了遗传中的个体发育和系统发育问题。
    这次争论，双方都没有能够用科学事实来说服对方。座谈会没有对有争论的问题作出结论。
    这次座谈会的特点之一是摩尔根学派的科学家在“百家争鸣”方针的鼓舞下，说出了自己几年以来没有说的话。在这以前，广泛流行着的摩尔根主义是“反动的”、“资产阶级的”等看法，妨碍了科学家充分发表自己的学术见解。在这次会议上，大家同意这种看法：应该把政治问题和学术问题分开。
    在这种情况下，许多摩尔根学派的科学家无保留地发表了自己的意见，有人曾经十次发言为自己的学术观点辩护。在这次座谈会中，绝大多数科学家的态度是严肃的，争论都是根据事实来进行的。
    有个别摩尔根学派的科学家曾经要求会议作出我国遗传学应该按照摩尔根学派方向发展的结论，认为只有采用摩尔根主义的方法才能在十二年内赶上遗传学的国际水平；认为在高等学校中应该只讲授摩尔根学派的细胞遗传学等。这些看法，受到其他科学家，包括一些摩尔根学派科学家的反对，他们认为这是和“百家争鸣”的精神不符的，是和实际情况不符的。
    大部分科学家在经过两星期的争论后，都感到遗传学是一门内容十分复杂，但又比较年轻的科学，有许多重要问题还没有弄清楚，任何一个学派都不应该认为自己已经达到了遗传学的高峰。他们认为摩尔根学派在遗传学研究上采用了分析遗传因子的方法，积累了不少事实，揭发了一些遗传规律，对遗传学是有贡献的，但是摩尔根学派的研究材料和研究方法，局限在比较狭窄的范围内，它只研究了遗传学中的一部分规律；米丘林学派从生物与环境相互联系和生物体作为一个整体的观点出发，提出的一些基本原则是正确的，积累的一些科学事实是有价值的，米丘林学派和实践的联系比较密切，但是米丘林学派所积累的试验结果还不很充足，并且对一些问题的提法也失之笼统和绝对化。
    大部分参加会议的科学家认为要想“一家独鸣”的思想是对遗传科学的发展有害的，具有各种不同看法的遗传学家都应该虚心倾听各方面的意见。我国米丘林学派的遗传学家，过去大都学习或研究过摩尔根学说，而摩尔根学派的遗传学家，在解放以后也大都学习或研究过米丘林学说，所以相互学习的条件是具备的。这次讨论增加了彼此的了解。在会议上，有的米丘林学派的科学家已经表示，自己在今后的研究工作中将更多地注意试验技术和进行深入的研究工作，有的摩尔根学派的科学家也表示今后要从过去狭窄的圈子里钻出来，注意联系实际。
    座谈会建议中国科学院成立遗传学学术委员会，来指导和协调全国遗传学的研究工作；建议成立遗传学研究所，作为我国遗传学研究的中心。有的科学家还认为在有条件的高等学校和农林部门的有关研究所中，也应该成立遗传学研究室，从各方面来加强遗传学的研究工作。
    会议认为，各有关的科学研究机构和高等学校应该本着“百家争鸣”的方针，保证各个学派都有同等的发展机会，都有同等的进行科学研究工作的条件；在一个研究机构或高等学校里，对处于少数派地位的科学家，应该保证他们有坚持自己的学术观点的自由，应该保证他们在进行科学研究和发表学术论文上有同等的权利。这样才能有利于更快地发展我国的遗传学，使它在十二年内赶上或接近世界的先进科学水平。
    在谈到发展我国遗传学的问题时，许多科学家认为必须注意遗传学同某些有关的学科，如细胞学、发育生理学、生物化学、生物物理学、生物统计学、实验胚胎学等的结合。
    许多科学家认为应当开始进行出版遗传学学报的筹备工作，并保证不同学派的科学家有同等权利在学报上发表科学著作。
    加强介绍国外遗传学文献的工作是到会科学家一致的主张。目前有许多摩尔根学派的重要著作在我国还没有翻译出版；对米丘林学派的文献的介绍也不全面，在过去几年中，大都只介绍李森科学派的著作，而对米丘林方向的其他学派的著作很少介绍，因此曾经使人误认为李森科学派的观点就是米丘林学说的全部内容。许多科学家提出了关于出版遗传学译报，及时介绍国外各学派的成就的建议。
    在讨论高等学校中的遗传学教学工作问题时，大多数科学家认为要培养具有现代遗传学水平的青年科学干部，必须在高等学校中把两个学派的主要观点都介绍给学生。关于课程设置等问题，有的主张在一门遗传学课程中介绍两个学派的观点，至于以米丘林学派的观点为主，还是以摩尔根学派的观点为主，有两种相反的意见。还有的认为目前要马上在一门课程中讲授两个学派的观点是有困难的，可以暂时开两种遗传学课程，分别讲授两个学派的观点，等到一定的时候，再合并成一门课程。有许多科学家则认为目前由于学校的性质不同和专业的任务不同，各个学校的师资和教学设备情况也不同，在最近的一个教学年度中不必作统一的规定。
    关于遗传学的教学问题，有不少科学家还认为和遗传学有密切关系的细胞学、生物统计学和田间技术等课程，也应该在高等学校中讲授。
    关于科学研究和教学工作问题，会议建议中国科学院、高等教育部和教育部根据会议上科学家们的意见，作出决定。
    这次座谈会对我国遗传学的发展，将会起良好的推动作用。科学家们在会上都表示，要在辩证唯物主义思想指导下加强科学研究工作，争取在十二年内使我国遗传学赶上国际水平。可以相信，在下一次的遗传学学术会议上，我国遗传学家必将提出更多更有价值的研究结果。
