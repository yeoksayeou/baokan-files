Xinhua News Agency, Landa, October 14th: Prime Minister Eden, at a Conservative Party members' meeting organized during the Conservative Party annual conference here on the afternoon of the 13th, once again emphasized taking a tough stance to resolve the Suez dispute.

He announced that Britain had never changed its position on the Suez issue. He said, "My speech in the House of Commons on July 30th remains valid, and these words are: 'Her Majesty's Government cannot accept any arrangement regarding the future of this important international waterway that places it under the unrestricted control of one country, which, as recent events have shown, will use the canal purely for national policy purposes.' Our desire remains: to have this position accepted through negotiations, if we can."

He continued, saying that some minor progress had been made in the United Nations talks on the Suez issue, but differences of opinion remained significant. He warned, "Do not make hasty and overly optimistic judgments."

Eden also stated that Britain "does not intend to modify or withdraw" its decision to take certain military measures in the Eastern Mediterranean. He also said, "We refuse to say that under any circumstances we would never use force."

He described all the actions taken by the British government as being in accordance with the United Nations Charter. He vehemently criticized the Labor Party's opposition to the government's Suez policy.

Eden also expressed satisfaction with the unity between Britain and France.

Speaking about domestic issues, Eden emphasized that Britain must strengthen its competitiveness in the world market. He reiterated that domestic consumption must be reduced to "encourage British exports." He also attacked the Labor Party's demands for nationalizing industries.

    艾登对苏伊士运河问题仍抱顽固态度
    拒绝保证在任何情况下不使用武力
    据新华社兰达诺14日电　艾登首相13日下午在这里的保守党年会所组织的一次保守党员会议上再一次强调要采取强硬态度去解决苏伊士争端。
    他宣布，英国从来没有改变过它在苏伊士问题上的立场。他说：“我7月30日在下院的发言继续有效，这些话就是：“关于这条重大的国际水道的将来的任何安排，如果是交由一个国家来对它进行不受拘束的控制，而这个国家又像最近的事件所表明的那样、将纯粹为了国家政策的目的来利用这条运河的话”那是女王陛下政府所不能接受的。我国的愿望仍然是：通过谈判来使得这一立场获得接受，如果我们可能的话。”
    他接着说，在联合国关于苏伊士问题的会谈中，已经取得了一些微小的进展，但是意见上的分歧仍然很大。他警告说，“不要作出匆促的和过分乐观的判断。”
    艾登还表示，英国“不打算修改和撤销”在东地中海采取某些军事措施的决定。他并且说：“我们拒绝在任何情况下我们都绝不使用武力。”
    他把英国政府所采取过的一切行动都说成是符合联合国宪章的。他激烈地抨击工党反对政府的苏伊士问题政策的态度。
    艾登还对英国和法国之间的团结表示满意。
    艾登在谈到国内问题的时候，强调英国必须加强它在世界市场上的竞争能力。他重申，必须用消减国内消费的办法来“鼓励英国输出”。他还攻击工党关于把工业收归国有的要求。
