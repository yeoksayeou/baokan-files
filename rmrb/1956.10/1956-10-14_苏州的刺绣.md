    Suzhou Embroidery
    Zhu Qi
    Suzhou is one of the most developed cities in China's silk weaving industry. Suzhou's "Su Embroidery" is as famous as Changsha's "Xiang Embroidery." As early as the tenth century (Song Dynasty), Su Embroidery had already begun to develop its unique style. By the mid-seventeenth century, it was at its peak, not only famous domestically but also spread abroad.
    During the Ming Dynasty, Su Embroidery was influenced by Gu Embroidery from Luxiang Garden in Shanghai. (Gu Embroidery is a combination of embroidery and painting, possessing a high level of artistry.) In modern times, Shen Shou (1874-1921) from Wu County created "Art Embroidery," with skillful and even stitches, establishing a unique style.
    After liberation, the Suzhou City established the "Embroidery Arts and Crafts Production Cooperative," organizing veteran artisans, exchanging experiences, and promoting apprenticeships to cultivate new talent. The former Suzhou Federation of Literary and Art Circles Embroidery Group further synthesized various Su Embroidery stitches and invented the "Scattered Stitch." Currently, there are more than 50,000 people engaged in embroidery in Suzhou and Wu County, mostly rural women and some urban housewives. At present, many products are exported to foreign countries. It is said that fifteen embroidered bedspreads can be exchanged for one ton of steel.
    Su Embroidery is widely used in many daily necessities (such as clothing, bedspreads, pillowcases, headscarves, shawls, tablecloths, cushions, etc.) and is welcomed by the broad masses of the people.

    苏州的刺绣
    朱契
    苏州是我国丝织工业最发达的城市之一。苏州的“苏绣”，和长沙的“湘绣”齐名。远在第十世纪（宋代），苏绣已经开始具有它独特的风格。到十七世纪中期，更盛极一时，不但驰名国内，并且流传到国外。
    明代，苏绣曾受到上海露香园顾绣的影响。（顾绣是刺绣和绘画的互相结合，具有很高的艺术水平。）到了近代，吴县沈寿（1874—1921）的“美术绣”，绣法熟练匀净，在风格上独树一帜。
    解放以后，苏州市成立了“刺绣工艺美术生产合作社”，组织老艺人，交流经验，并且提倡带徒弟，培养新生力量。前苏州市文联刺绣小组，更综合了苏绣的各种针法，发明了“散套针”。现在苏州、吴县两地从事刺绣的共有五万人以上，大多是农村妇女和一部分城市家庭妇女。目前产品运销到国外的很多，据说十五条刺绣被面可换回一吨钢材。
    苏绣被广泛地应用到许多日用品上面（如服装、被面、枕套、头巾、披肩、桌布、靠垫等等），受到广大人民群众的欢迎。
