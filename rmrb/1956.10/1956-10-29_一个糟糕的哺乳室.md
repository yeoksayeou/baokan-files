    A Terrible Nursing Room
    The nursing room of the Beijing Railway Administration is terribly managed. The children's cotton pads and small clothes are often soiled with feces, and diapers are not washed or changed. The room has a strange and offensive odor. In the summer, it becomes a gathering place for flies. The children's diet is not quantified or regular, and many children suffer from indigestion and are often sick, resulting in them being pale and thin. Taking the children to the hospital for treatment is naturally the mothers' responsibility, so the mothers bear a heavy mental burden. Some mothers say, "I feel restless when I think of the children, and my writing hand trembles when I hear them cry." This naturally reduces work efficiency.
    In the past, we have reported the problems of the nursing room to Chief Wang of the General Affairs Department and the chairman of the grassroots trade union, but we only received responses of principle and did not see any solutions. In principle, the Women Workers' Department of the district trade union should be concerned about this issue, but the Women Workers' Department turns a blind eye. Recently, one of our mothers raised an opinion to Comrade Jiao Jing of the Women Workers' Department, and Comrade Jiao Jing told her to find a solution with the grassroots trade union. In August of this year, on a hot noon, Minister Sun of the Women Workers' Department of the district trade union, passed by the nursing room and saw that there were no electric fans and the room was so stuffy that the children were crying. She promised to solve the electric fan problem, saying that if the administration would not buy them, they could borrow one from the district trade union. However, it was just talk. The Health Department of the agency also does not care about the sanitation and health care work of the nursing room. In May of this year, some children developed chickenpox, and the mothers suggested that other children be vaccinated as a preventive measure. Comrade Liu of the Health Department said, "Children are all going to get chickenpox, so you don't need to worry about it; it doesn't matter." We cannot help but ask, if we follow the reasoning of Comrade Liu of the Health Department, everyone is bound to get sick, and illness can be neither prevented nor treated, then what is the purpose of the health department? Couldn't our Comrade Liu of the Health Department go home and rest?
    There are many other problems in the nursing room of the Beijing Railway Administration, and we will not list them one by one. We hope that this will attract the attention of our agency leaders, conduct an in-depth inspection of the work of the nursing room, and ensure that the problems can be thoroughly resolved.

    一个糟糕的哺乳室
    北京铁路管理局的哺乳室办得很糟糕，孩子的棉垫、小衣裤上常有粪便，尿布也不给洗换，室内奇臭难闻。夏天，这里便成苍蝇集聚之所。小孩的饮食不定量，不定时，许多孩子消化不良，生病的很多，弄得个个面黄肌瘦。带孩子上医院看病，当然是妈妈们的事，因此，妈妈们精神负担很重。有的妈妈说：“一想到孩子们就感到坐立不安，一听见孩子哭，写字的手都打哆嗦。”这样，工作效率自然不会高。
    过去，我们曾向总务处王科长和基层工会主席反映过哺乳室的问题，但是只听到原则性的答复，没看见解决问题。照理，区工会女工部应该关心这个问题，但是，女工部却置若不闻。最近我们有一位妈妈找女工部焦敬同志提意见，焦敬同志叫找基层工会解决。今年8月间，一个炎热的中午，区工会女工部孙部长，假道经过哺乳室，看见没有电扇，室内闷热得小孩直哭，便答应给解决电扇问题，说要是行政上不买，可以借区工会的来用。然而也只是说说而已。机关卫生处对哺乳室的卫生保健工作也不管。今年5月，有的孩子生水痘，妈妈们提意见要求对其他的孩子施行预防，卫生处的刘同志竟说：“小孩都是要出水痘的，可以不用管，没关系。”我们不禁要问，如果按照卫生处刘同志的说法推论，每个人也免不了会生病的，病可以不防不治，那么，还要卫生部门干嘛？我们卫生处的刘同志不就也可以回家休养了吗？
    北京铁路管理局的哺乳室存在的问题还很多，我们就不一一列举了。我们希望能引起我们机关领导上的重视，深入检查一下哺乳室的工作，使问题能得到彻底解决。
