    The Achievements and Problems of Opening Free Markets in Xinhui County
    Lin Zu
    Xinhui County is a major economic crop area in Guangdong Province, and the local market has always been relatively active. However, in the past year or two, the local commercial departments have managed the market too rigidly, adopting a method of "unified control by department, closed off by region" for all commodities, which has restricted the production potential of agriculture, sideline industries, and handicrafts, affected the operating enthusiasm of small vendors, and caused some blockages in the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, failing to meet the needs of the people.
    In early August, the county opened free markets under the leadership of the state. The market situation in the month or so after opening has been good. The main achievements are as follows:
    The exchange of goods between urban and rural areas has been expanded, the artificial blockages have been gradually overcome, and the market has been enlivened. After the market was opened, regional blockades were abolished, and supply and marketing cooperatives and small vendors could freely purchase goods, thus increasing the variety of goods traded in the market. For example, the Hetang Huangwan Grocery Group increased its operating varieties by 270 compared to before the market opening, and the Hui City department store industry increased its commodities by 780. Musical instruments, gas lamps, funnels, and other items that had never been sold in Waihai Town before are now available. On the other hand, the amount of agricultural and sideline products on the market has also gradually increased. The food company purchased 5,091 pigs in July, and the number purchased in August increased to 5,861. The number of live chickens, ducks, and fresh eggs purchased has also increased to varying degrees. Due to the large quantity and variety of commodities on the market, the county's rural retail sales in August (after the market opened) increased by 8.5% compared to July.
    Agricultural and sideline production has been stimulated. In the past, state-owned companies took on too much, and the purchase prices were unreasonable, and the purchases were not timely, thus restricting the production of agricultural and sideline industries to a certain extent. After the market was opened, production and sales met directly, the blockades were lifted, and sales channels were opened for products, which strongly promoted the enthusiasm for developing production. After the opening of the melon and vegetable market in Huicheng Town, various districts in the county and Taishan and Kaiping began to purchase goods from Huicheng, thereby expanding the sales of melons and vegetables. Accordingly, the cultivated area of vegetables has also increased. The melon and vegetable planting area of an agricultural production cooperative in Chengnan has expanded to more than 160 mu, an increase of four times compared to last year. Farmers in Waihai District had no experience in raising ducks in the past, and few people raised flocks of ducks. Now, farmers in the entire district raise more than 90,000 ducks. Those who did not raise pigs in the past have now started raising meat pigs and sows.
    After the opening of the free market, the handicraft industry restored its previous purchase and sales relationship and actively improved product quality and reduced costs. The Waihai Town Ironware Cooperative had a backlog of products worth more than 1,000 yuan per month in the past. Since resuming purchase and sales relationships with Zhongshan, Jiangmen, and other counties, a new situation of production falling short of sales has emerged. As production increases, costs decrease accordingly, and product prices have also been adjusted appropriately. Among them, each hoe has been reduced by 2 jiao, and the price of kitchen knives has been reduced by 10%. In the past, 70% of the bamboo products produced by the Bamboo Cooperative in Gujing Town did not meet specifications, but now more than 90% of the products meet specifications.
    State-owned commercial institutions actively improve their business management and service attitudes, and overcome bureaucratic work styles. After the market was opened, some commercial departments have adopted methods such as "write-off upon taking goods," "fixed location and quantity," and "sugar jars on platforms" in commodity storage to reduce commodity deterioration, so that the business department has a clear understanding of the commodities in order to replenish the supply in a timely manner. The Jiangmen allocation group of the Xinhui County Trading Company took the initiative to contact small vendors and introduce them to inventory commodities. Some supply and marketing cooperatives also regularly contact agricultural cooperatives to understand purchase and sales situations and the needs of the masses. State-owned commercial institutions are now studying how to adjust their structures to accelerate the circulation of commodities.
    After the opening of the free market, small vendors can freely choose their purchases, which has increased their operating enthusiasm. For example, in addition to actively purchasing vegetables from farmers, the Huicheng melon and vegetable group also organized people to go to Zhaoqing, Sanbu, Jiangmen, and other places to organize more than 2,000 yuan worth of goods such as onions, ginger, and garlic. Before the market was opened, 38 small vendors in Waihai District could not maintain their livelihoods. After the market was opened, their operating income increased, and the number of households in difficulty has now been reduced to 7. Small vendor Feng Yuhang said: "Three markets a day, we used to eat porridge, now we eat rice."
    Opening up free markets under the leadership of the state has had a significant and positive effect on enlivening the economy, stimulating production, and meeting the diverse needs of the people, but it has also brought some new problems: some commodities have experienced a disconnection between listed and market prices, especially the current shortage of seedlings, where prices are more chaotic; due to the implementation of free purchasing, commercial departments cannot accurately grasp market sales conditions, and are afraid of overstocking if they purchase too much and stockouts if they purchase too little; because some farmers are unwilling to fulfill pre-purchase contracts, the supply and marketing cooperatives and state purchasing units are unable to complete their purchasing plans smoothly; after the opening of the free market, some farmers' business ideas have begun to sprout, directly affecting agricultural production. Thirteen agricultural members in Hetang Township in this district have applied to do business. Some farmers have relaxed agricultural production because they are keen on sideline production (which is correct).
    The above-mentioned problems that have emerged after the opening of the market still need to be further studied and resolved by the local Party committee in accordance with the spirit of the central government's instructions and the local actual situation.

    新会县开放自由市场的成效和问题
    林祖
    新会县是广东省的一个主要经济作物区，当地市场历来比较活跃。但是，最近一两年来，由于当地商业部门对市场管理过严过死，不管什么商品都采取“条条统，块块封”的办法，因而束缚了农、副业和手工业的生产潜力，影响了小商贩的经营积极性，城乡物资交流受到某些阻塞，人民需要不能得到满足。
    8月初，全县开放了国家领导下的自由市场。开放后一个多月的市场情况是良好的。主要成绩如下：
    扩大了城乡物资交流，逐步克服了人为的阻塞现象，活跃了市场。市场开放后，取消了地区封锁，供销社和小商贩可以自由进货，因而市场经营品种增加。如荷塘皇湾杂货小组经营品种比市场开放前增加二百七十种，会城百货行业增加商品七百八十种。外海镇从来没有经营过的乐器、汽灯、漏斗等，也有了供应。另方面，农副产品上市量也逐渐增加，食品公司7月份收购生猪五千零九十一头，8月份收购数就增加到五千八百六十一头，活鸡、活鸭、鲜蛋的收购数量也都有了不同程度的增加。由于商品上市数量多、品种增加，全县农村零售额8月份（开放市场后）比7月份上升8.5％。
    刺激了农副业生产。过去国营公司大包大揽，在收购价格上不合理，收购不及时，因而对农副业的生产有一定束缚。市场开放后，产销直接见面，取销了封锁，为产品打开了销路，有力地促进了发展生产的积极性。会城镇开放了瓜菜市场后，县内各区和台山、开平各地都开始从会城进货，从而扩大了瓜菜销售额。并相应地增加了蔬菜耕地面积。城南一个农业生产合作社瓜菜种植面积已扩大到一百六十多亩，比去年增加了四倍。外海区农民过去没有养鸭的经验，很少人养群鸭，现在全区农民养鸭九万多只。过去没有养猪的，现在都养起肉猪和母猪来。
    开放自由市场后，手工业恢复了以前的购销关系，积极提高产品质量，降低成本。外海镇铁器社，过去每月积压产品总值达一千多元，自从和中山、江门等县恢复购销关系后，已经出现了产不供销的新局面。由于产量增加，成本费随之减低，产品价格也作了适当的调整。其中锄头每个降低二角，菜刀价降低10％。古井镇竹器社生产的竹篸过去有70％不合规格，现在已有90％以上产品合乎规格。
    国营商业机构积极改善经营管理和服务态度，克服工作中的官僚主义作风。开放市场后，有些商业部门在商品保管方面已经采取了“取货注销”“定位定量”“糖缸做地台”等办法，减少商品变质，使营业部对商品心中有数，以便及时补充货源。新会县贸易公司江门调拨组主动和小商贩取得联系，向他们介绍库存商品。有的供销社还定期和农业社联系，了解购销情况和群众需要。现在国营商业机构正在研究调整机构，以便加速商品流转。
    开放自由市场后，小商贩可以自由选购，提高了他们的经营积极性。如会城瓜菜小组除积极向农民采购蔬菜外，还组织人到肇庆、三埠、江门等地组织洋葱头、生姜、蒜头等二千多元货源。外海区在市场开放前有三十八户小商贩不能维持生活，市场开放后，由于营业额有了增加，目前困难户已经减少到七户。小商贩冯玉行说：“一日三市，过去吃粥，现在吃饭。”
    开辟了国家领导下的自由市场，对活跃经济、刺激生产、满足人民多方面的需要上，起了显著的良好效果，但同时也带来了一些新的问题：有些商品发生牌、市价脱节现象，特别是当前货源较缺的种苗，价格较为混乱；由于实行自由选购，商业部门不能准确的掌握市场销售情况，进多了货怕积压，进少了怕脱销；因为有的农民不愿执行预购合同，影响到供销社和国家采购单位不能顺利地完成收购计划；开放自由市场后，个别农民的经商思想开始萌芽，直接影响了农业生产。这个区的荷塘乡有十三个农业社员提出申请要做生意。有些农民由于热中于副业生产（这是对的），而放松了农业生产。
    上述开放市场后所出现的一些问题，尚有待当地党委根据中央指示的精神和当地的实际情况，进一步研究解决。
