Female Youths in the Karamay Oilfield
Han Wenhui
In the Karamay oil region, one sees female nurses meticulously caring for patients in tents, female surveyors carrying water bottles and theodolites, running around in the sun-drenched oilfields, or female logging workers and mud collectors splashed with crude oil and mud. They are doing excellent work in the oil region.

Once, I visited the female chemists in the mud laboratory of the oil region. This laboratory was located in a cellar of less than ten square meters, most of which was occupied by laboratory equipment, and it felt a bit crowded with two people standing inside. Apart from a few instruments, all the equipment was very crude. People who don't understand would find it hard to believe that this is a detailed laboratory guiding the drilling work in the Karamay oilfield.

Li Shulian, who was in charge of the chemical testing work, introduced their work situation to me.

When the mud laboratory was established in March of this year, there were no other testing equipment besides a few simple testing instruments, but the drilling scale gradually expanded, and the work of the mud laboratory had to keep up. Li Shulian and three female chemists started working in this cellar. The laboratory did not have bottles for holding medicines, so they searched for wine bottles and canned goods from the canteen and staff dormitories to replace them; there were no wooden shelves for placing medicine bottles and tables for work, so they found waste wooden boards on the construction site and nailed them into tables and wooden shelves; the soft sandy ground in the cellar could not be used for mud testing, so they collected the cement scattered on the ground at the well site and used their hands to transform the sandy ground into a cement floor. Without equipment for testing the strength of solidified cement, Li Shulian designed her own drawings and asked welders to make a substitute instrument from scrap materials. They not only overcame difficulties to create the laboratory, but also, in the case of lack of barite and cement in the exploration area, successfully tested the use of local loess to replace expensive barite for drilling, and the method of adding sand to cement to replace pure cement for well cementing. This method of saving cement and barite has now been promoted in many drilling teams, and it will save the country a large amount of drilling investment.

These complex and strenuous experimental works were carried out in this cellar of less than ten square meters. Experimental work had to be done squatting on the ground or bending over. In more than a month of continuous trials, they were so tired that their backs and legs ached, but no one stopped working to rest. Li Shulian said: "Any career is always difficult at the beginning. In Karamay, we feel it is an honor to be able to work here from the very beginning."

None of the female nurses working in the clinics in the Karamay oilfield are uneasy about their work because of the harsh environment. In the past few months, in tents as hot as steamers, they had to work more than ten hours a day. They not only had to do nursing work, but also work as pharmacists and cleaners. When nurse He Yumei first arrived at the clinic, because the pharmacy did not have a pharmacist, the leadership sent her to act as a pharmacist. He Yumei had not studied this course at all in school, nor had she worked in the pharmacy, but she had just completed her self-study of pharmacology in the first half of this year and understood the general knowledge of pharmaceutical work. However, she still accepted the job. At that time, Karamay was in the hot season, the outdoor temperature rose to over 130 degrees Fahrenheit, and dysentery was prevalent among the staff, with many people coming to the clinic every day. The dispensing and dispensing of medicines for so many patients would be difficult for even a very skilled pharmacist to handle. But He Yumei still dispensed all the medicines for outpatients in a timely manner every day. Under the guidance of the doctor, she prepared the medicines and dosages for general dysentery symptoms the night before, so that when she received this prescription the next day, she could quickly dispense the medicine to the patient. But there were still many medicines that had to be prepared temporarily. Due to hard study and serious work, He Yumei did not make a single minor mistake during her tenure as a pharmacist.

Mi Shujuan, a young woman from Shanghai, is now the only female logging worker in Karamay. The testing work is carried out in the Gobi Desert, tens of kilometers away. Every day at dawn, Mi Shujuan would carry her water bottle and set off with the male comrades to the field; she would not return until dusk. The work on the well is quite strenuous. When she started moving the winch for the steel wire rope, she would be covered in sweat after winding a few meters. In July, the sun in the Gobi Desert was like a pot of fire, and the tools would get hot after being left on the ground for a while. Mi Shujuan's face was tanned dark, her arms were peeling, and her hands were blistered after working in the field for less than a few days. Every day after work, she was so tired that she didn't even bother to take off her clothes and fell asleep. In mid-July, several times the drinking water was cut off in the field, she was so thirsty that she could not speak, and her limbs were weak, and she was unable to continue to support herself. However, the logging work could not be stopped halfway. When she saw that the male workers on the well, although also thirsty and unable to speak, still insisted on working, she cheered herself up and finally persevered until the end of work. This young girl has never bowed her head in the face of these difficulties. Now she is not only completely accustomed to the hard field life and the strenuous labor on the well, but she is also able to independently use the logging instrument to log wells and measure the liquid level at the bottom of the well. Her body is fatter and stronger than when she first came to the Karamay oilfield.

Every weekend, the young women become the most active people in the Karamay oil region. They carefully dress themselves up, put on beautiful skirts, and go to weekend parties with great interest, or gather in cellars and tents in groups of twos and threes to sing to their hearts' content. Some girls, accompanied by their lovers, go to the wilderness to play in the face of the magnificent sunset. Many girls have fallen in love with the hardworking and brave young men here. They have made up their minds to settle down here and build this promising oil region of the motherland.

    克拉玛依油区的女青年
    韩文慧
    在克拉玛依油区，人们看到了在帐篷里精心护理病人的女护士，背着水壶、扛着经纬仪在烈日当头的油田上跑来跑去的女测量员，或者是身上溅满原油和泥浆的测井女工和泥浆采集员。他们在油区工作得很出色。
    有一次我访问了油区泥浆化验室的女化验员们。这个化验室设在一个不到十平方公尺大的地窖里，一大半地方被化验设备占去了，屋里站上两个人就感到有点挤。化验设备除很少几部仪器外，所有用具都十分粗糙。不了解的人，很难相信这是指导克拉玛依油田钻探工作的一个细致的化验场所。
    负责化验工作的李淑廉向我介绍了她们的工作情形。
    今年3月泥浆化验室成立时，除了几件简单的化验仪器外，其他化验设备都没有，但是钻井规模逐渐扩大，泥浆化验室的工作不能不跟上去。李淑廉和三位女化验员就在这个地窖里展开了工作。化验室没有装药的瓶子，她们就到饭堂、职工宿舍搜罗了酒瓶、罐头筒来代替；没有放置药瓶的木架和工作用的桌子，她们就到工地上找来废木板钉成了桌子和木架；地窖里松软的沙土地面上无法进行泥浆化验，她们就到井场上收拾了撒在地上的水泥，用手把沙土地改造成水泥地面。没有试验固井水泥强度的仪器，李淑廉就自己设计图样，请电焊工人用废料制成一个代用仪器。她们不仅克服困难创造了化验室，而且在探区重晶石和水泥缺乏的情况下，试验成功了用当地黄土代替价值很贵的重晶石来钻井，在水泥里加沙子来代替纯水泥固井的办法。这种节约水泥和重晶石的办法，现在已经在许多井队推广，它将为国家节约大量的钻井投资。
    这些复杂、费力的试验工作就是在这间不到十平方公尺大的地窖里进行的。试验工作要蹲在地下或弯着腰才能进行。在一个多月连续多次的试验中，累得她们腰疼、腿酸，可是谁也没有停止工作休息过。李淑廉说：“任何一种事业开头时总是困难的，在克拉玛依，一开头就能在这里工作，我们感到这是一种光荣。”
    在克拉玛依油田担负医务所工作的女护士，没有一个因为环境艰苦而不安心工作。过去几个月，在热得像蒸笼一样的帐篷里，她们每天都要工作十多个小时。不仅要作护士工作，还要兼司药、清洁员的工作。护士何玉梅刚到医务所时，因为药剂室还没有一个司药人员，领导上派她来代理司药工作。何玉梅在学校根本没有学过这一门课程，也没有在药剂室工作过，只不过在今年上半年自修完了药物学，懂得药剂工作的一般知识。但是，她还是接受了这项工作。当时，克拉玛依正是炎热的季节，室外气温上升到华氏一百三十多度，职工当中流行痢疾，每天有许多人前来门诊。这么多病人的配药和发药工作，就是一个十分熟练的司药也很难胜任。但是何玉梅每天还是及时配发了所有门诊病人的药。她在大夫指导下，把当时一般痢疾病症所服的药和药量在先一天夜里都配好，到第二天她接到这种药方时，就很快地把药发给病人。但是还有好多药要临时配。由于努力学习和认真工作，何玉梅在代理司药期间没有发生过一次细小的错误。
    来自上海的女青年米淑娟，现在是克拉玛依唯一的女测井工人。试油工作是在几十公里以外的戈壁上进行。每天天一亮，米淑娟就背上水壶，和男同志一起出发到野外；黄昏时才回来。井上的工作都相当费力，开始搬绞钢丝绳的绞车时，她绞上几公尺就累得满头大汗。7月间，戈壁上的太阳像一盆火，工具在地上放上一会就发烫。米淑娟在野外工作不到几天，面孔就晒得黝黑，两臂脱皮，手上烫起了泡，每天收工回来后，累得连衣服都顾不上脱，倒头就睡。7月中旬，有几次在野外饮水断绝，口渴得说不出话，四肢发软，已经无力继续支持了。但是测井工作是不能中途停止的，当她看到井上男工人们虽然也渴得不能说话仍然坚持工作的时候，她就鼓了鼓气，终于坚持到收工。这位年轻的姑娘在这些困难面前一直没有低过头。现在她不仅完全习惯了艰苦的野外生活和井上费力的劳动，而且已经能够独立使用测井器测井，量井底液面。她的身体比刚来克拉玛依油田时长得更胖更结实了。
    每当周末的时候，年轻的姑娘们就成为克拉玛依油区最活跃的人物。她们细心地打扮了自己，换上美丽的裙衫，兴致勃勃地去参加周末晚会，或者三三两两地聚在地窖里、帐篷里尽情歌唱。有的姑娘伴着自己的情侣，迎着瑰丽的晚霞到旷野去游玩，许多姑娘已经爱上了这里勤劳而勇敢的男青年，她们已立志在这里安家立业，建设祖国这个希望很大的油区。
