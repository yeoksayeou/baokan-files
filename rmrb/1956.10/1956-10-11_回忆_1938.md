    Recollections of 1938
    Hu Zhongchi
    In the summer of 1938, the living room of a three-story building at No. 2 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession of Shanghai became lively. The front door facing the road, which was not usually opened, could not be closed because the doorbell rang repeatedly. Bundles of packages from the bookbinders were delivered to the house, and soon the news of the publication of the Complete Works of Lu Xun spread. Strangers came in one after another. They were Lu Xun's loyal readers. They received the first batch of new books with red covers by presenting their reservation coupons, and each of them smiled, as if they had found a treasure. "Eight dollars for such a set of twenty volumes!" This was one surprised comment I heard.
    Indeed, eight dollars for a complete set was surprisingly cheap. But there was great significance to it. The reason why the Complete Works of Lu Xun could be published in the dangerous wartime environment was first and foremost due to the readers who organized themselves to reserve the books by paying eight dollars. At that time, several old newspapers in the Shanghai concessions ceased publication. The leading institutions of major bookstores retreated to the interior. Everyone knew that publishing progressive new books in the "isolated island" of the concessions was a considerable risk. Without the enthusiastic support of those several hundred readers who reserved the books, the publication of the Complete Works of Lu Xun would have been impossible. Moreover, the reservation price was entirely reasonable based on cost accounting. Shanghai's concessions had strong technical capabilities. Under the impact of the war, a large number of skilled workers lost their jobs, many factories closed, and the price of paper also fell. This phenomenon of surplus human and material resources naturally reduced the cost of printing books.
    The Fuxing Society, which undertook the publication of the Complete Works, was a cooperative with socialist tendencies formed by a group of intellectuals who remained in the Shanghai concessions in the early spring of 1938 and were unwilling to remain idle. The original motive was only to publish "Red Star Over China" (the Chinese translation of "Red Star Over China" written by American journalist Edgar Snow). At that time, more than a dozen people each donated fifty yuan to buy paper, dozens of people raised hundreds of yuan of reader reservation fees for printing costs by running around and collecting them through their social connections, and others did some piecemeal voluntary labor for a while. In this way, the book was printed and distributed under the name of the Fuxing Society. This book was very popular, and the cooperative accumulated some funds. It was on the basis of this meager accumulation of funds and a reliable reader organization that the Fuxing Society undertook the urgent task of publishing the "Complete Works of Lu Xun," which comprised more than six million words.
    Once the publication plan for the Complete Works was finalized, a team of active volunteers immediately formed. The battle began. Zhang Zonglin, a practitioner of Tao Xingzhi's life education ideals, served as the manager of the Fuxing Society. He allocated funds, liaised externally, and organized a reader network, so that users in the interior, Nanyang, and the United States could send money. Huang Youxiong, who had lived in the same house with Lu Xun for several years before the January 28th Incident, carefully planned and took care of a series of publishing processes, made various necessary technical designs, and cooperated closely with Xu Guangping and Wang Renshu, who were in charge of editing and proofreading the Complete Works in another location. When he was too busy, I helped him run errands, deal with the workers, and occasionally offered some small ideas. At the work sites of the typesetting, printing, and binding departments, I personally witnessed the workers' enthusiastic and vigorous selfless labor for the publication of the Complete Works. They all seemed to know that Mr. Lu Xun was also their mentor in publishing art, and consciously and voluntarily played a great positive role in improving the quality of the publication of the Complete Works. A typesetting expert from Da Feng Type Foundry prepared to return to his hometown to visit his relatives, but because we wanted him to rush the work on the Complete Works, he stayed. Wu Songsheng, a good printer who had been unemployed due to the impact of the war, immediately stopped the machine to fill in the plate when he saw that the edge of a No. 5 character was slightly faded. A shop assistant in a binding workshop automatically took out materials that exceeded the original specifications and was willing for his boss to pay for some of the money. These examples all show that they were infected by the spirit of Lu Xun. It was the concerted efforts and close cooperation of the workers in each link that ensured the timely completion of the publication plan of the Complete Works of Lu Xun.
    The publication of the Complete Works of Lu Xun was done quickly, well, and economically. The most printed, of course, was the popular edition, priced at twelve yuan and reserved at eight yuan. But at the same time, a small number of two higher-priced editions were also printed, mainly to supply the needs of the mainland and abroad. The Daolin paper edition had a cloth cover with gold lettering, priced at fifty yuan. The commemorative edition had a leather cover with gold lettering and was packed in a nanmu box, priced at one hundred yuan.
    Each batch of the Complete Works consisted of four or five volumes in a row. After four or five batches, the set was complete.
    In the spiritual life of people on the so-called "isolated island," the appearance of the Complete Works of Lu Xun was like a spring emerging in the desert.
    When I received my set and put it on the bookshelf, how touched I was! I stared blankly at the two-foot-long row of red and white books for a long time. I thought to myself: "You have given me courage when I was emotionally depressed and directed me when my thoughts were confused. I should recognize you as my mentor. But I really don't understand your rich wisdom deeply or thoroughly enough! I must learn from you, and learn again."
    This happened close to the second anniversary of Lu Xun's death. Now the twentieth anniversary has arrived. Looking back, I realize that over the years, I have not properly fulfilled the wishes I made in the past. Not only can I not talk about going deeper or more thoroughly now, but even the superficial knowledge I learned in the past seems to be about to be abandoned. I am truly ashamed of this.
    May the appearance of the new version of the Complete Works of Lu Xun give me another opportunity to encourage myself.

    回忆1938
    胡仲持
    1938年夏天，上海法租界巨籁达路二号，一幢三层楼房的客堂间里显得活跃起来。平时不常开的靠马路的前门，因为门铃接连地响，也关不住了。从装钉作来的一捆一捆的包件送进这屋子不多久，鲁迅全集出版的风声就传开了。素不相识的人们陆陆续续地进来。他们就是鲁迅的忠实读者。他们凭着预约券领到第一批红色封面的新书，个个笑逐颜开，仿佛拾到了什么宝贝。“八块钱，这样的二十大本！”这是我听到的一种似乎吃惊的声音。
    的确，八块钱一部全集是便宜得似乎使人难信的。但是说来却大有意义。鲁迅全集之所以能够在险恶的战时环境下出版，首先不能不归功于那些组织起来的读者出八块钱来定书。当时上海租界里几家老报馆停刊了。各大书店的领导机构撤退到内地了。谁都想得到：在人们比作“孤岛”的租界里，出进步的新书要担不小的风险。如果没有那么几百位定书的读者的热情赞助，鲁迅全集的出版是无法实现的。而且预约价根据成本核算，也完全合理。上海租界里有着雄厚的技术力量。在战争的打击下，大批技术工人失了业，许多厂家关了门，纸张也跌了价。这种人力物力过剩的现象自然而然使得书籍的印制成本降低了。
    承办全集出版业务的复社是1938年春初留在上海租界的一群不甘寂寞的知识分子因偶然的机会组织起来的一个具有社会主义萌芽性质的合作社。原初的动机只是要出版“西行漫记”（美国记者爱特伽·斯诺所写的“中国的红星”的中译本）。当时十多人每人捐出了五十元买纸张，几十人通过自己的社会关系，东奔西走征集到读者预约金几百元作印刷成本，另外一些人干了一阵子零零碎碎的义务劳动。这样，书印出来了，用复社的名义来发行。这部书十分畅销，使这个合作社的资金有了一些积累。就在这仅有的资金积累和可靠的读者组织的基础上，复社承担起出版六百多万字的“鲁迅全集”的突击任务来。
    全集的出版计划一经商定，志愿参加工作的积极分子的队伍立即形成了。战斗开始了。陶行知先生的生活教育理想的实行家张宗麟担任了复社经理。他调度经费，对外联络，组织读者网，使内地、南洋和美国都有定户寄钱来。“一二八”以前曾和鲁迅先生同屋住了几年的黄幼雄细心策划和照管一系列的出版过程，作出各种必要的技术设计，同在另一地方负责全集编校工作的许广平、王任叔他们取得了密切的配合。在他忙不过来的时候，我帮他跑跑腿，和工人们打打交道，间或也出些小主意。我在排字、印刷和装订各部门的工作地点，亲眼看到工人们热情蓬勃地为全集的出版进行着忘我劳动的情景。他们似乎全都知道鲁迅先生在出版艺术方面也是他们的导师，自觉自愿地在提高全集出版质量方面发挥着很大的积极性。大丰制版所的一个排字能手准备好回乡去省亲，因为我们要他赶一下全集的工，他就留下来了。在战争的打击下失过业的好印工吴松盛看到一个五号字的边角略略淡些，马上停了机器来填版。一家装订作里的一个伙计自动拿出质量超过原定规格的材料来使用，情愿自己的老板贴些钱。这些事例都说明他们是受到了鲁迅精神的感染的。就是各个环节的工人们的齐心努力和密切配合保证了鲁迅全集出版计划的如期完成。
    鲁迅全集的出版工作是做得又快又好又省的。印得最多的当然是定价十二元、预约价八元的普及本。但也同时附印了一小部分价格较高的两种版本，主要是供应内地和国外的需要。道林纸本布面金字，定价五十元。纪念本皮面金字，是用楠木箱装的，定价一百元。
    全集每出一批就是一连四、五卷。出了四、五批就出齐了。
    在所谓“孤岛”上的人们的精神生活中间，鲁迅全集的出现，真好比沙漠上涌现了水源。
    当我领到了我的一部，把它插到书架上的时候，我是多么的感动呵！我对着两尺长的红白辉映的行列，出神地看了好一会。我心里想：“您在我情绪消沉的时候给过我勇气，在我思想迷惘的时候给我指示过方向。我应当认您是我的恩师。但对于您的这么丰富的知慧，我实在是体会得太不深，太不透！我一定要向您学习，再学习。”
    这是靠近鲁迅先生逝世两周年时候的事。现在是二十周年纪念到来了。我回顾一下：这么多年来，我一直没有好好地实践自己过去所许下的心愿。到现在深些，透些固然谈不到，甚至连过去所学到的粗浅的一点点也似乎都要丢荒了。这在我实在是有愧于心的。
    愿鲁迅全集新版本的出现再给我一次自勉的机会吧。
