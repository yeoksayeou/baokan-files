    Tibetan Sakya Proverbs
                    * A truly learned person will have more and more friends; sandalwood from the Himalayas relies on the "wind" to spread its fragrance.
                   * An upright person will correct even the smallest mistakes, while a despicable person will ignore even the biggest faults; even a speck of dirt must be removed from cheese, but distiller's yeast [note] is deliberately added to wine.
    [Note] Distiller's yeast: Yeast used for making wine, which Tibetans consider
       to be most unclean.
                    * An upright person shines even brighter in times of difficulty; when a torch is held downwards, the flame still burns upwards.
                    * A cultivated person hides himself, yet his reputation still spreads throughout the world; when osmanthus flowers are placed in a bottle, their fragrance still shoots out in all directions.
              * A king is only great in his own country, but a scholar is respected everywhere; a flower is only an adornment on the head for a day, but turquoise [note] remains on the head forever.
    [Note] Turquoise: The most precious gemstone in Tibet, emerald green, often used as a headdress.
             * No matter what difficulties a clever person encounters, he will not do anything foolish; no matter how thirsty an Indravajra bird [note] may be, he will not drink dirty water from the ground.
    [Note] The Indravajra bird is a bird that, it is said, only drinks rainwater from the sky, hence the name.

    西藏萨迦格言
                    ＊真正有学问的人，朋友会越来越多；喜马拉雅山上的檀香，靠“风”替他把香气散扬。
                   ＊正直的人连一点小过都要改正，卑劣的人再大的过失也不理会；奶酪里有一点儿浮土也得除掉，酒里头还特意放进酒曲子〔注〕去哩。
    〔注〕酒曲子：做酒用的酵母，藏人认为
       最不洁净。
                    ＊正直的人在危难的时候，越发显得光明磊落；火把往下垂的时候，火舌还是一个劲儿向上烧。
                    ＊有修养的人把自己掩藏起来，他的名声还是在世界上传扬；把桂花装进瓶子里，他的香气还是射往四方。
              ＊国王仅仅在自己国土里是伟大的，学者却到处受人尊敬；花朵在头上仅仅是一天的装饰，松耳石〔注〕却永远在头上停留。
    〔注〕松耳石：西藏最宝贵的宝石，葱绿色，经常作为头饰。
             ＊聪明人无论遇到怎样的困难，但他也不会做一件傻事；等雨雀〔注〕无论渴到什么程度，他也不会去喝地上的脏水。
    〔注〕等雨雀是鸟名，据云专门喝天上雨水，故名。　　		　王尧选译
