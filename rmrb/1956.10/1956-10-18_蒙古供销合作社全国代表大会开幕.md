Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, October 17th: The 14th National Congress of the Mongolian Supply and Marketing Cooperative opened in Ulaanbaatar on the 15th.

The supply and marketing cooperative plays a significant role in Mongolia's national economy. In the thirty-five years since its establishment, the cooperative's membership has increased to 260,000, with subscribed capital reaching 4.5 million Tugriks. Ganjuurjab, Chairman of the Central Council of the Mongolian Supply and Marketing Cooperative, stated in his report to the congress that in the four years since the 13th National Congress in 1952, the cooperative's commodity turnover rate has gradually increased, rising by 42.6% in 1955 compared to 1952, exceeding the average annual commodity turnover rate stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957).

The congress received congratulatory telegrams from the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Council of Ministers. The telegrams congratulated the cooperative on the important role it has played in expanding the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and meeting the needs of the people. At the same time, it pointed out that there are still phenomena of unreasonable distribution of goods and untimely transportation in the cooperative, and some organizations cannot complete their tasks in procurement work in a timely manner.

Mongolian People's Republic party and government leaders Tsedenbal, Damba, Sambu and others attended the congress that day. The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and the Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives of the Soviet Union also sent representatives to the congress.

    蒙古供销合作社全国代表大会开幕
    据新华社乌兰巴托17日电　蒙古供销合作社第十四次全国代表大会15日在乌兰巴托开幕。
    供销合作社在蒙古的国民经济中起着重大的作用。在合作社成立以来的三十五年中，合作社的社员已经增加到二十六万人，入社的资金达到四百五十万图格里克。蒙古供销合作社中央理事会主席冈儒尔热布在大会上作报告指出，自从1952年的第十三次全国代表大会以来的四年中，合作社的货物周转率逐渐增加，1955年比1952年增加了42.6％，已经超过了第二个五年计划（1953年—1957年）规定的每年货物的平均周转率。
    会上宣读了蒙古人民革命党中央和部长会议的贺电。电文对合作社扩大城乡物资交流、供应人民需要所起的重要作用，表示祝贺。同时指出合作社还存在分配货物不合理、运输不及时的现象，有些组织在收购工作中也不能及时完成任务。
    蒙古人民共和国党和政府的领导人泽登巴尔、达姆巴、桑布等出席了当天的大会。中华全国供销合作总社和苏联消费合作社中央联合会也派代表出席了大会。
