New Atmosphere in Commercial Work

Simplifying Procedures and Reports

	In Wuhan, the joint state-private stores have improved their service quality by simplifying unnecessary procedures and reports. Previously, each salesperson in the joint state-private Hua'an Department Store could only serve two customers at a time. After simplification, they can now serve four customers simultaneously and promptly answer customer inquiries. The joint state-private Da Zhong Silk and Fabric Store reduced and simplified nine types of reports and abolished the detailed commodity classification ledger. As a result, two of the original five accountants could be freed up to work on the sales floor. Both employees and customers are satisfied with this improvement.

	After the implementation of full industry-wide joint state-private ownership in Wuhan's private commerce, commercial and tax departments, purely for the sake of management convenience, stipulated various complex and unreasonable purchase and sales systems and accounts for each store. There were as many as thirty or forty types of reports. At the same time, from the Commercial Bureau, Commercial Sub-bureau, to the district stores, and its more than twenty sections, all exercised leadership over the joint venture stores. This multi-headed leadership meant that the directors and accountants of the joint venture stores not only had to be constantly responsible for receiving visitors, but also had to report and introduce the same material and the same events to the heads of each unit separately. Accountants at the joint state-private Hua'an Department Store worked more than twelve hours a day to cope with these reports. Salespeople had to fill out complicated "tally sheets" every time they sold something, leaving them no time to answer customer inquiries. This practice was criticized after inspection by the relevant leading organs in Wuhan. Now, many unnecessary reports have been eliminated in some stores, and the content of the remaining reports has also been appropriately streamlined. At the same time, leadership has been unified, and simplified sales methods have been restored.

Restoring Original Purchase and Sales Relationships

	After the joint state-private stores in Tianjin's department store and knitwear industries restored their original purchase and sales relationships, the variety of goods increased. The famous Beijing "Grape Chang" glass grapes and the steel knives engraved with delicate flowers made by "Steel Knife King," which the people of Tianjin had not seen for many years, are now on display in Tianjin shopping malls. Southern-style foods such as pickled mangoes and preserved plums, which had not met with customers for more than three years, are also on display in the Senji Daoxiangcun and other southern-style food stores. Shanghai's famous Kangfu brand floral socks and Shantou's famous handicraft embroidered tablecloths, pillowcases, headscarves, etc. can also be bought in many department stores.

	The original purchase and sales relationships of these industries were once interrupted during the socialist transformation of commerce and began to recover in the first half of this year. The knitwear industry currently operates about 300 more types of goods than in the second quarter. According to statistics from more than 150 large and medium-sized department stores, the variety of goods has also increased by more than 700 types. These department stores have restored their original purchase and sales relationships with more than 170 joint venture factories and handicraft production cooperatives in the city, and have established new purchase and sales relationships with more than 380 production units. For some commodities, department stores can order goods from factories and production cooperatives by telephone, and the procedures are very simple.

A Vegetable Market Praised by the People

	The people of Wuhan have recently praised the vegetable market for its variety and quality of vegetables. Housewives can freely choose at the vegetable stalls. This is the result of the Wuhan Vegetable Company, Vegetable Service Station, Vegetable Production Cooperative, and Supply and Marketing Cooperative's initial implementation of the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee's plan to reform the production, supply, and marketing of vegetables.

	After the Wuhan Vegetable Company recently changed its business methods of package purchase and sale, and centralized circulation, the vegetable markets have become active one after another. They can directly transport vegetables to the vegetable gardens to ensure the freshness of the vegetables. For some vegetables that are in short supply, they also organize supplies from neighboring counties to ensure market supply. Except for the prices of more than ten major vegetables that are uniformly stipulated and announced daily in the local newspapers, the remaining prices can be negotiated by the vegetable supply and marketing and production cooperatives, as well as the vegetable service stations, based on the quality and market supply and demand. This not only makes the prices reasonable but also encourages vegetable production cooperatives to pay attention to improving the quality of vegetables. The city's vegetable supply and marketing cooperatives have now implemented a method of pricing according to grades and have formulated a new service agreement of "free choice, no bundling."

    商业工作中的新气象
    简化手续和报表
    武汉市的公私合营商店因为简化了不必要的手续和报表，服务质量有了提高。过去公私合营华安百货商店每个营业员只能同时接待两个顾客，简化以后，现在已能同时接待四个顾客，及时答复顾客的询问。公私合营大中绸布商店减少和简化了九种报表，废除了商品明细分类账以后，原有的五个会计就可以抽出两个来上柜参加营业。经过这一改进，商店职工和顾客都感到满意。
    武汉市私营商业实行全行业公私合营以后，商业、税务等部门单纯为了管理上的方便，曾经对各个商店规定了各种繁杂、不合理的进货、销货制度和账目，各种报表多到三、四十种。同时，从商业局、商业分局，一直到区商店，以及所属的二十多个科、股，都对合营商店实行领导。这种多头领导，使得合营商店的主任、会计不仅要经常负责接谈，而且往往同一材料，同一事件，要分别向各单位的负责人汇报和介绍。公私合营华安百货商店会计人员，为了应付这些报表，每天工作十二小时以上。营业员每卖一次货，要填写复杂的“记数单”，无暇答复顾客的询问。这种作法经过武汉市有关领导机关检查以后，才得到批判。现在已经在部分商店中取消了很多不必要的报表，对剩下的报表的内容也作了适当的精简，同时统一了领导，恢复了简易的售货方法。
    恢复原有购销关系
    天津市百货、针棉织品等行业的公私合营商店恢复原有的购销关系以后，商品品种增加了。天津市人们多年没见到的著名的北京“葡萄常”制做的玻璃葡萄、“钢刀王”制做的刻有精细花朵的钢刀，已经陈列在天津商场里。三年多没有和顾客见面的酱芒果、月梅等南味食品，也在森记稻香村等南味食品店里摆出来了。上海名牌货康福牌花袜、汕头市著名的手工艺品抽纱台布、枕头套、头巾等，在不少百货店里也可以买到。
    这些行业原有的购销关系，在商业的社会主义改造过程中曾一度中断，今年上半年以来开始恢复。针棉织品行业目前经营的商品已比第二季度增加三百种左右。另据一百五十多家大、中型百货商店统计，商品品种也比以前增加了七百多种。这些百货商店已经和本市一百七十多个合营工厂、手工业生产合作社恢复了原有的购销关系，并且分别和三百八十多个生产单位建立了新的购销关系。有些商品，百货店可以用电话向工厂和生产社进货，手续很简便。
    人们称赞的菜市场
    武汉市人们最近都称赞菜市场上的蔬菜花样多，质量好。家庭主妇们可以在菜摊边随意挑选。这是市蔬菜公司、蔬菜服务站、蔬菜生产合作社和供销合作社初步贯彻执行了市人民委员会制定的改革蔬菜产供销工作方案所收到的效果。
    武汉市蔬菜公司最近改变了包买包卖、集中吞吐的经营方式以后，各个菜市场就相继活跃起来，他们可以直接到菜园运菜，保证蔬菜的鲜嫩。有些较缺的菜，还到邻县去组织货源，保证市场供应。除了上十种主要蔬菜的价格有统一规定，每天在当地报纸上公布外，其余价格可以由蔬菜供销和生产合作社以及蔬菜服务站根据质量好坏和市场供求情况议定。这样不但价格合理，而且促使蔬菜生产合作社注意提高蔬菜质量。市内的蔬菜供销合作社现在都已实行分等论价的办法，订立了“任凭挑选、决不搭配”的新的服务公约。
