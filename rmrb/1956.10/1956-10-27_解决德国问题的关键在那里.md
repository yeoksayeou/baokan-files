Where Lies the Key to Solving the German Question?

Someone is using the German question to spread smoke screens, creating tension between West Germany and the Soviet Union, to cover up the rearmament of West Germany, the expansion of Germany's division, and to obstruct the further relaxation of the international situation. This clumsy trick is the so-called "pressure" on the Soviet Union recently planned by the United States and the Adenauer government.

On September 7, the West German government submitted a note and memorandum to the Soviet Union, attempting to blame the prolonged failure to resolve the German question on the Soviet Union, and re-proposed the so-called "unification" demand to annex the German Democratic Republic through "free elections." Subsequently, on October 10, the United States, Britain, and France also submitted notes to the Soviet Union to support this provocative action by the West German government. This duet performance was performed entirely according to the tune made by Adenauer and Dulles during their meeting in June this year. Dulles said at the time without concealment that the "concrete action plan" he had "agreed upon" with Adenauer was to create a kind of "moral pressure" and "treat the Soviet Union's attitude towards the German unification issue as a touchstone for all our other relations with the Soviet Union." The West German government also openly "warned" the Soviet Union in its note to the Soviet Union that if the Soviet Union does not accept their unreasonable demand for a "unified Germany," "it will be impossible to establish truly normal relations between the two peoples." There is no more superficial and ugly international conspiracy than this.

The Soviet Union's reply note to the West German government on October 22 gave a powerful response to this international conspiracy. The Soviet reply note once again put forward the proposition that the enemies of German unification are very afraid to face squarely: because there are two countries and two different systems in Germany, the only realistic way to solve the German unification problem must be negotiations between the two Germanys. This proposition is irrefutable and conforms to the general demands of the German people. The German Democratic Republic has made unremitting efforts to seek the rapprochement and negotiation between the two Germanys in order to realize the unification of the motherland. More and more political representatives in West Germany are also advocating for the rapid holding of East-West German negotiations. Recently, the West German Free Democratic Party held talks with the East German Free Democratic Party. The communique of the talks advocated that all German people should regard themselves as the primary spokespersons of their own cause and achieve the reunification of Germany. However, the United States and the Adenauer government stubbornly refuse to hold negotiations with the German Democratic Republic to resolve the German unification issue, and even vainly attempt to achieve Germany's "unification" through violent aggression.

In fact, the Adenauer government has been accelerating its rearmament under the guise of "peaceful unification," preparing for the adventurous undertaking of unification by force. After the Washington talks, Adenauer publicly stated that West Germany would make "full military contributions" to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. West Germany is starting to build a 500,000-strong defense force, develop arms production, and prepare to equip its troops with atomic weapons. At the same time, in order to remove obstacles to rearmament, the West German government brazenly declared the West German Communist Party illegal and attacked other democratic forces. The West German government's implementation of this policy of reviving militarist aggressive forces and suppressing democratic and free rights cannot but deepen Germany's division and confrontation, and also expose the extreme hypocrisy of their insistence on unifying Germany through "free elections."

At the same time, the West German government has been trying its best to slander the Soviet Union's policies of peace and international friendly cooperation, obstruct the normal work of the Soviet embassy in West Germany, interrupt negotiations on developing trade relations with the Soviet Union, and delay the repatriation of Soviet citizens stranded in West Germany, thereby creating tension between the two countries. The West German "Social Democratic Party Bulletin" and other newspapers have accused these practices of West Germany as attempts to undermine diplomatic relations between the two countries. This more clearly exposes that the West German government is fundamentally unwilling to promote international conditions conducive to resolving the German unification issue.

As everyone knows, the Soviet Union has consistently been willing and striving to promote rapprochement and agreement between the two Germanys in order to facilitate the early restoration of German unification. Its establishment of diplomatic relations with the two Germanys is conducive to achieving this goal. However, the policies adopted by the United States, Britain, and France run counter to this. West Germany's various unfriendly activities towards the Soviet Union are also completely inconsistent with the interests of resolving the German unification issue.

The Soviet Union's reply note once again clarified its consistent policy of supporting Germany's restoration of unification and making Germany a peaceful and democratic country, and expressed its willingness to further exchange views with the West German government on issues concerning relations between the two countries. This sincere attitude of the Soviet Union has won the sympathy and support of public opinion.

The key to solving the German question lies in whether the West German government is willing to adopt realistic policies. The results of its past policies of reviving militarism and obstructing Germany's democratic unification have made its domestic position increasingly shaken. If it does not change this bankrupt policy, it will never get good results.

### 解决德国问题的关键在那里

    解决德国问题的关键在那里
    有人正在利用德国问题散布烟幕，制造西德和苏联的紧张关系，来掩盖重新武装西德、扩大德国分裂的活动，阻挠国际局势的进一步缓和。这个拙劣的诡计，就是最近美国和阿登纳政府所策划的对苏联施展的所谓“压力”。
    9月7日，西德政府向苏联提出照会和备忘录，企图把德国问题的迟迟不能解决归咎于苏联，并重新提出所谓经由
  “自由选举”并吞德意志民主共和国的“统一”要求。接着在10月10日，美、英、法三国也向苏联提出照会，用以支持西德政府的这个挑拨性行动。这种一唱一和的双簧戏，是完全按照今年6月阿登纳和杜勒斯会谈时所制成的曲子表演的。杜勒斯在当时毫不掩饰地说，他同阿登纳
  “商妥”的“具体行动计划”，是要造成一种“道义上的压力”，“把苏联对于德国统一问题的态度，当作我们同苏联的所有其他关系的试金石”。西德政府在给苏联的照会里也公然“警告”苏联，如果苏联不接受他们的“统一德国”的无理要求，“两国人民之间就不可能建立真正正常的关系”。再没有比这个国际阴谋更浅薄更丑恶的了。
    苏联在10月22日给西德政府的复照，给了这个国际阴谋以有力的回答。苏联复照再一次提出了德国统一的敌人十分害怕正视的主张：由于德国存在着两个国家和两种不同的制度，因此解决德国统一问题的唯一现实办法，就必须是由两个德国之间进行谈判。这个主张是无可辩驳的，并且符合于德国人民的普遍要求。德意志民主共和国为谋求两个德国的接近和谈判，以实现祖国的统一，作了不懈的努力。西德也正有愈来愈多的政治代表人物，主张迅速举行东西德谈判。最近西德自由民主党就同东德自由民主党举行了会谈，会谈公报主张全德人民应该以自己事业的首要代言人自任，达成德国的重新统一。但是，美国和阿登纳政府死硬地拒绝同德意志民主共和国举行谈判，来解决德国统一问题，还妄想用暴力侵略方式实现德国的“统一”。
    事实上，阿登纳政府一直是在假借“和平统一”之名，加紧进行重整军备，准备武力统一的冒险勾当。华盛顿会谈后阿登纳公开声言，西德要对北大西洋公约组织作出“充分的军事贡献”。西德正在开始建立五十万国防军，发展军火生产，并准备以原子武器装备军队。同时，为了扫除重新武装的障碍，西德政府悍然宣布西德共产党非法，并向其他民主力量进攻。西德政府执行这种复活军国主义侵略势力、镇压民主自由权利的政策，就不能不加深德国的分裂和对立，同时也因此而暴露了他们坚持经由“自由选举”统一德国的主张的极端虚伪性。
    与此同时，西德政府竭力诽谤苏联的和平和国际友好合作的政策，阻挠苏联驻西德大使馆进行正常工作，中断同苏联发展贸易关系的谈判，拖延遣返流落在西德的苏联公民，借此制造两国的紧张关系。西德“社会民主党公报”和其他报纸曾指责西德的这些做法是在企图破坏两国外交关系。这就更加清楚地暴露出西德政府根本不愿意促进有利于解决德国统一问题的国际条件。
    大家知道，苏联一贯愿意并努力促成两个德国间的接近和达成协议，以便于早日恢复德国的统一。它同两个德国建立的外交关系，有利于实现这个目标。但是，美、英、法采取的方针，却与此背道而驰。西德对苏联的种种不友好活动，也完全不符合于解决德国统一问题的利益。
    苏联的复照再次阐明了它始终不渝地支持德国恢复统一，使德国成为一个和平的和民主的国家的政策，并表示愿意同西德政府就两国关系问题作进一步的交换意见。苏联这个真诚态度取得了公众舆论的同情和支持。
    解决德国问题的关键，在于西德政府是否愿意采取现实的政策。它过去执行复活军国主义、阻挠德国民主统一的政策的结果，已使它在国内的地位日益动摇。它如果不改变这个破了产的政策，是决不会得到好的结果的。
