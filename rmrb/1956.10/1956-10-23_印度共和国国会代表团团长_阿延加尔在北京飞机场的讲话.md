Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd. Speech by Mr. A. Ayyangar, Head of the Delegation of the Parliament of the Republic of India, at the Beijing Airport this morning. The full text is as follows: Mr. Liu Shaoqi and friends:

    We must now bid farewell to you. We do so not without some pain. We came as friends, and we return as even closer friends, if not relatives and kin. We have only stayed here for three weeks. But we can assure you that we have enjoyed the kind of friendship that exists for generations. Wherever we went, we were warmly welcomed. Your country can indeed be called a nation of the rising sun. Darkness has passed, and light has arrived. The rising tide is absolutely irresistible, and any country in the world that tries to suppress your rise is futile. It is not only unworkable and impossible but also inappropriate. I hope and believe that Western countries will recognize this and be more realistic in recognizing you as the representative of China, the true representative of China. The sooner the United Nations Security Council accepts the People's Republic of China instead of the Chinese Kuomintang government, the better it will be for China and the whole world. People must be more realistic than they are now. It would be a very sad mistake to call a deer a lion in the forest and ignore the real lion. Therefore, I even call on Chiang Kai-shek to become friends with you, forget all hatred, and stand with you once again, taking his proper place among you. I know you are magnanimous, you do not bear old grudges, and I am sure you will welcome him and receive him as a friend once again.

    I have found in my talks with your leaders that you are even generous to your former enemy, Japan. The coasts of Japan and the coasts of China are constantly washed by the waters of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Ocean takes its name from peace, so the two countries are fundamentally unable to quarrel. I hope that the two countries will also lean on each other. Someone is trying to separate Taiwan from your country, but Taiwan will naturally return to you, and Japan must also form an alliance with you. The imperialists also divided our country. In any case, we must lean on each other and no longer rely on foreign aid to our country. An unprecedented sense of unity and enthusiasm is spreading throughout the Asian continent. This was clearly expressed at the Bandung Conference. No force in the world can shake us, and we will all unite together in the future. In the future, all countries will be able to become friends with each other instead of being the rulers of others. The lion of the East has awakened. It is wise to see this and make friends with them. I wish good fortune to hundreds of millions of people, longevity and prosperity to those who are now alive, those who will soon be born, and the hundreds of millions who are being born in this country and my country almost every minute. I pray to God that the friendship we began many centuries ago and have re-established will last forever, and that none of our problems will hinder the relationship between our two great nations. Even the Himalayas cannot stop us, and we will try to open air routes over the Himalayas. Although we will be thousands of miles apart from you in less than two or three days, I can assure you that our hearts are with you. We hope you will become more and more prosperous; and hope to exchange our science, scientific knowledge, and send professors, students, and politicians to visit each other; so that whenever you want a vacation, you can come to India to spend it; we will do the same. We will pass on the very pleasant experience of this visit to all the hundreds of millions of people in our country—no matter how difficult this is; and try to make them even closer to you, to fulfill their wishes, and sincerely hope to travel to China once before they die, and then go to another world. If you wish, you should also visit India at least once in your life. May God bless us. I thank you. I know that some of you do not get up early, not because you are born to like to sleep, but because you work all night. Please forgive me for disturbing your sleep. We will cross the entire continent with your best wishes, and may our two countries live together forever. I will bring your message of goodwill to our Prime Minister and our people. Thank you all.

    印度共和国国会代表团团长
    阿延加尔在北京飞机场的讲话
    新华社22日讯　印度共和国国会代表团团长阿·阿延加尔今天早晨在北京飞机场的讲话。全文如下：刘少奇先生和朋友们：
    我们现在必须向你们告别了。我们这样作并不是没有什么痛苦的。我们来的时候是朋友，我们回去的时候成了更加亲密的朋友，假如还没有成为亲属和亲戚的话。我们在这里仅仅逗留了三个星期。但是我们可以向你们保证，我们享受到世世代代存在的那种友谊。我们无论到哪里，都受到了热切的欢迎。你们国家的确可以称得上是旭日东升的国家。黑暗已经逝去，光明已经到来。上升的浪潮是绝对压制不下去的，世界上任何国家试图压制你们的上升，都是徒劳的。那不仅是行不通和办不到的，而且也是不适宜的。我希望而且相信，西方国家会认识到这一点，并且较为实际一点，承认你们是中国的代表，是中国的真正的代表。联合国安全理事会越早地接纳中华人民共和国而不是中国国民党政府，对于中国和全世界说来也就越有好处。人们必须比目前更加现实起来。把麋鹿叫作森林中的狮子而忽略真正的狮子，那将是一个十分可悲的错误。因此，我甚至呼吁蒋介石同你们变成朋友，忘却一切仇恨，再一次地同你们站在一起，在你们中间取得他的适当的地位。我知道你们心胸宽大，你们不念旧恶，我确信你们会欢迎他，再一次把他当作朋友接待他。
    我在同你们的领袖们进行的交谈中发现，你们甚至对你们以前的敌人日本都是宽洪大量的。日本的海岸和中国的海岸都是不断被太平洋的海水冲洗的。太平洋的名字取自和平，所以这两个国家是根本不能够争吵的。我希望你们两国也将靠在一起。有人试图把台湾从你们的国家分割出去，但是台湾自然一定要回到你们那里，而日本也必定要同你们结成联盟。帝国主义者也把我们的国家给分裂了。无论如何，我们一定要靠在一起，一定不再依靠外国人给予我们的国家援助。一种前所未有的团结和热诚感正在整个亚洲大陆蔓延起来。这在万隆会议上明显地表示出来了。世界上没有任何力量能够震撼我们，今后我们大家团结在一起。今后各国都能够相互成为朋友，而不是作别人的统治者。东方的狮子已经醒了。看清这一点，并且和他们做朋友，这是明智的。我谨祝千千万万的人民幸运，祝现在生存的、不久将出生的和差不多每一分钟正在这个国家和我的国家出生的千百万人长寿和富裕。我祈求上帝，我们在许多世纪以前开始的而又重新建立的友谊将永远存在，我们的任何问题都不会阻碍我们这两个大国之间的关系。连喜马拉雅山也不能阻挡我们，我们将设法开辟越过喜马拉雅山的航线。虽然不到两三天以后我们就将同你们相隔万里了，但是我可以向你们保证，我们的心是同你们在一起的。我们希望你们愈来愈繁荣；并且希望能够交流我们的科学、科学知识，互相派遣教授、学生、政治家进行访问；这样，什么时候你们想要度假日，你们就到印度来过吧；我们同样也将这样。我们将把这次访问中非常愉快的经历转告给我们国内全体亿万人民——不论这是多么困难；并且设法使他们同你们更加大大靠近，以了结他们的心愿，衷心地希望在去世以前一定要到中国去旅行一次，然后再到另一个世界去。如果你们愿意的话，同样，你们在一生里至少也应该到印度去访问一次。愿上天保佑我们。我感谢你们。我知道，你们中间有些人是不在清早起身的，这并不是说你们生来喜欢睡觉，而是因为你们彻夜工作。我打扰了你们的睡眠，请原谅我。我们将带着你们最好的祝愿越过整个大陆，愿我们两国永远生活在一起。我将把你们的亲善的信息带给我们的总理和我们的人民。谢谢你们大家。
