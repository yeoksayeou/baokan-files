Xinhua News Agency report: Anshan No. 2 Mining Construction Engineering Company, by implementing the work method of the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee and the mass line, has successfully completed the state construction plan every month since the beginning of this year. The company's original annual construction plan for this year was comprehensively overfulfilled four months ahead of schedule in August. By the end of September, nearly half of the company's workers had joined the ranks of advanced producers, and 44% of the construction teams had become advanced construction teams. The company also promoted seventy-seven new technologies and advanced experiences, so that every worker in every type of work mastered at least one new working method. The average amount of work they completed each month exceeded the state quota by 23%.

Last year, the company had difficulty completing its construction tasks. Since January of this year, with the development of the advanced producer movement, the Party's leadership in the company has been strengthened. All major issues are collectively discussed by the Party committee, concentrating wisdom and unifying thoughts and actions. Then, decisions are made, and Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres participating in the Party committee distribute the work among themselves to mobilize the masses to implement them. In this way, the advanced producer movement has continued to develop in depth, and the state construction plan has been comprehensively overfulfilled every month.

In implementing the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee, the company attaches great importance to the unity of Party committee members. They promptly carry out criticism and solve individual ideological problems that hinder unity, and pay special attention to fully developing democracy to ensure that Party committee meetings are well conducted. Before convening a Party committee meeting, each Party committee member is notified in advance of the issues to be discussed at the meeting to prepare systematic and comprehensive opinions in advance. If there are major differences of opinion on the issues being discussed, a hard-and-fast conclusion is avoided as much as possible. Instead, they go down to conduct investigations and research separately, and then convene a meeting to unify their thinking before making a decision.

The company's Party committee pays close attention to solving weak links in its work in a timely manner to ensure the comprehensive, early, and over-fulfillment of the construction plan. After the advanced producer movement in the company flourished in January, work stoppages due to material shortages occurred in various work areas, and there was an urgent need for the work of the departments to keep up. After discussion, the company's Party committee concentrated its efforts to mobilize the staff in the departments, quickly changing the backward state of work in the departments and improving the management level of the enterprise. Now, 34% of the engineering and technical personnel and staff in the company have become advanced workers, and three-quarters of the departments have become advanced or excellent departments. In March of this year, the company's experience in departmental work has been widely promoted in construction enterprises in Anshan.

In the first three months of this year, there were twelve engineering quality accidents in the company. However, after discussion, the company's Party committee believed that although these accidents were not serious, their impact was not good. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, in addition to organizing forces to strengthen technical management, the company's administrative leaders implemented a self-inspection system for engineering quality at all levels among construction workers, group leaders, and foremen based on the principle of "whoever constructs is responsible for the quality of the project." This greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of employees to consciously ensure engineering quality, so that since April, there have been no major quality accidents affecting the life of the project, and it has become the unit in Anshan with the best guarantee of engineering quality.

In implementing the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee, the company's leadership earnestly implemented the work method of the mass line, ensuring the correctness of collective leadership. At the beginning of this year, after the workers formulated group plans, the members of the company's Party committee felt unclear about how to further develop the advanced producer movement. They went separately to solicit the opinions of the workers. The workers suggested that the group plan was the workers' goal. With it, everyone knew how much work they should do every day to ensure the early completion of the five-year construction plan; the leadership should do their best to help the workers achieve their group plans. In this way, the Party committee found the correct way to deepen the advanced producer movement. However, by March, only 30% of the groups had achieved their plans, and in April, only 52% of the groups had achieved their plans. The Party committee members went separately to investigate the reasons why the group plans were not being implemented well. Some workers reported that the foremen did not pay attention to creating conditions for the workers to achieve their plans; some workers reported that the work area's task sheets were not issued in a timely manner, and the construction preparation work was not done well. After analysis and research, the Party committee unanimously believed that the two problems raised by the workers were correct, and they separately mobilized the cadres to improve the foreman's business leadership and planning management work. After that, the implementation of the group plan quickly improved.

In formulating and implementing the annual, quarterly, and monthly construction plans, the company's Party committee often pays attention to mobilizing the masses to deeply tap potential, which has played a great role in ensuring the over-fulfillment of the state plan. May was the month with the heaviest construction tasks for the company, and there were many objective difficulties, so there was a risk that the plan would not be completed. However, after the Party committee organized forces to deeply mobilize the masses, the plan was still overfulfilled this month. In June, the company's leadership originally estimated that it could only complete 820,000 yuan of work. However, after the Party committee mobilized employees to tap construction potential in many ways, they completed 1.43 million yuan of work.

Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the company regularly holds production meetings of construction teams, representative meetings of workers in work areas, economic activity analysis meetings, and departmental business analysis meetings to give play to and concentrate the wisdom of the masses and improve the management of the enterprise. Party committee members also promptly learn about many important situations from the forty-odd construction teams they are assigned to contact. In addition, the Party committee regularly organizes cadres to go deep into the workers' dormitories to solve the workers' living difficulties and do a good job in the work of their families, which also improves the workers' awareness and production enthusiasm.

    贯彻执行党委领导下的厂长负责制和群众路线的工作方法
    鞍山第二矿山建筑工程公司月月完成计划
    据新华社讯　鞍山第二矿山建筑工程公司贯彻执行党委领导下的厂长负责制和群众路线的工作方法，今年以来月月都出色地完成了国家建设计划。全公司今年原订的全年施工计划，提前四个月在8月份就全面地超额完成了。到9月底止，全公司几乎有半数的工人走进了先进生产者的行列，有44％的施工小组变成了先进的施工小组。全公司还推广了七十七种新技术和先进经验，因而每一个工种的工人都掌握了一种以上的新的工作方法，他们平均每个月所完成的工作量超过了国家定额23％。
    去年，这个公司的施工任务完成得很吃力。今年1月份以来，随着先进生产者运动的开展，公司里党的领导加强，一切重大问题都经过党委集体讨论，集中智慧，统一思想和步调，而后作出决议，由参加党委会的党、行政、工会、青年团干部分头发动群众贯彻执行。这样，就使得先进生产者运动一直逐步深入地向前发展，因而月月都全面地超额完成了国家施工计划。
    这个公司在贯彻执行党委领导下的厂长负责制中，很重视党委成员的团结。他们对有碍团结的个人思想问题及时开展批评，加以解决，并且特别注意充分发扬民主，以保证开好党委会。在召开党委会议以前，就将会议上要讨论的问题事先通知每个党委委员，提前准备好比较系统的全面的意见。如果对于所讨论的问题有较大的分歧意见，就尽可能不下硬性结论，分头到下面去调查研究以后，再召开会议统一思想，而后作出决议。
    公司党委很注意适时解决工作中的薄弱环节，以保证全面提前和超额完成建设计划。今年1月全公司先进生产者运动蓬勃开展起来以后，各工区都发生了停工待料的现象，迫切要求科室工作跟上去。公司党委经过讨论，集中力量分头发动科室工作人员，迅速改变了科室工作的落后状态，提高了企业的管理水平。现在这个公司已经有34％的工程技术人员和职员变成了先进工作者，四分之三的科室变成了先进的或优秀的科室。今年3月份这个公司的科室工作经验已经在鞍山各建筑企业单位普遍推广。
    今年的头三个月里，全公司曾发生过十二次工程质量事故。但是，公司党委经过讨论以后认为：虽然这些事故都不严重，影响却不好。在党委统一领导下，公司行政领导方面除了组织力量加强技术管理以外，还根据“谁施工，谁对工程质量负责”的原则，在施工的工人、小组长和工长中执行了逐级检查工程质量的自检制度。这样，就大大激发了职工自觉保证工程质量的积极性，因而从4月份以来，就没有发生过影响工程寿命的重大质量事故，变成了鞍山市保证工程质量最好的单位。
    在实行党委领导下的厂长负责制中，公司领导切实地执行了群众路线的工作方法，保证了集体领导的正确。今年年初，工人们订了小组规划以后，公司党委成员对于如何进一步开展先进生产者运动都感到不明确。他们分头去征求工人的意见。工人们提出：小组规划是工人的奔头，有了它，大家就都知道为了保证提前完成五年建设计划，应该在每天里做多少工作了；领导上应该尽力帮助工人们实现小组规划。这样，党委会找到了深入开展先进生产者运动的正确途径。可是到了3月份，仅有30％的小组实现规划，4月份也只有52％的小组实现规划。党委成员就分头下去调查研究小组规划实现得不好的原因。有些工人反映，说工长不注意给工人创造实现规划的条件；有些工人反映，说工区的任务单下达不及时，施工准备工作做得不好。党委经过分析研究，一致认为工人们提出的这两个问题都是正确的，他们分头发动干部改进了工长的业务领导和计划管理工作。以后，小组规划实现的情况就很快地好转。
    在制定和执行年、季、月的施工计划中，公司党委经常注意发动群众深入挖掘潜力，这对保证超额完成国家计划起了很大作用。5月份是这个公司施工任务最繁重的一个月，客观困难也很多，计划有完不成的危险。可是经过党委组织力量深入发动群众，结果这个月仍是超额完成了计划。6月份，公司领导方面原来估计只能完成八十二万元的工作量。但是经过党委发动职工多方面挖掘施工潜力以后，竟完成了一百四十三万元的工作量。
    这个公司在党委统一领导下，经常举行施工小组生产会议、工区职工代表会议、经济活动分析会议和科室业务分析会议，以发挥和集中群众的智慧，改进企业的管理工作。党委委员从分工联系的四十多个施工小组里，也及时了解许多重要情况。此外，党委经常组织干部深入职工宿舍，解决职工生活困难，做好家属工作，也提高了职工的觉悟和生产积极性。
