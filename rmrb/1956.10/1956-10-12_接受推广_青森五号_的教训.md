In order to clarify the situation of reduced production and losses caused by the promotion of early Japonica rice "Aomori No. 5" in Hunan Province, the Ministry of Supervision, together with the Ministry of Agriculture, formed an inspection team. From late June to late July, they went to Changde, Chenxian, Hengyang, and Xiangtan four special districts and Hengnan, Xiangtan, Hengyang nine counties (cities) for inspection. The joint inspection team listened to the briefings and opinions from the Party and government leading organs of each special district and county, and focused on in-depth field observations and investigations in eighteen agricultural cooperatives.

Seed Transfer and Promotion Process

With the consent of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Hunan Provincial Agricultural and Grain Bureaus sent a telegram to the Ministries of Agriculture and Grain on December 31 last year, proposing that Hunan Province plans to expand the planting of Japonica rice by two million mu this year, and requesting approval to transfer more than 15 million jin of high-quality rice seeds from Liaoning, Hebei, and other places. In early January this year, the Agriculture Bureau dispatched Gan Shucun, section chief, and three others to first learn about the experimental planting experience of Japonica rice in Hubei over the years from the Central China Agricultural Science Research Institute and the Hubei Provincial Agriculture Bureau, then went to the Ministry of Agriculture to request instructions on the seed transfer, and then to Liaoning and Jilin to conduct seed inspection and transfer.

After Gan Shucun and others arrived in Northeast China and contacted relevant units, they learned that Liaoning and Jilin could only allocate 50,000 jin of "Yuanzi No. 2," and "Xingya," "Weiguo," etc., were not available, but Japonica rice "Aomori No. 5" (commodity grain) could be transferred in large quantities. So Gan Shucun reported the situation to the Hunan Provincial Agriculture Bureau and asked whether to change to transfer "Aomori No. 5." After the leading cadres of the Agriculture Bureau convened relevant personnel to study, they decided to transfer 3 million jin of "Aomori No. 5," and submitted a written report to the Ministry of Agriculture on the trial planting of Japonica rice, believing that there were conditions for developing Japonica rice in Hunan Province. It was proposed to transfer 12.16 million jin of "Yinfang," "Yuanzi No. 2," etc., and 3 million jin of "Aomori No. 5" to carry out large-scale demonstration promotion in the Dongting Lake area, and trial planting demonstrations in farms in mountainous and hilly areas.

The Ministry of Agriculture, based on Hunan's report, telegraphed a reply to the Hunan Provincial Agriculture Bureau, agreeing to the allocation.

The areas where this batch of seeds was distributed were: Xiangtan, Changde, Chenxian, Hengyang, Shaoyang, Qianyang special districts and the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, as well as Changsha and Hengyang cities. The total number of seeds distributed was 3,013,000 jin. The total sowing acreage of this batch of seeds was 215,972 mu.

Technical Guidance and Growth Conditions

The agricultural departments at all levels in Hunan Province provided general technical guidance for the promotion of early Japonica rice and conducted research at production meetings, and promoted it in newspapers and periodicals. The main contents of the technical points they formulated were: (1) Sun-drying seeds, selecting seeds with salt water, sowing early, and evenly and sparsely sowing to cultivate tender and strong seedlings; (2) Early transplanting and dense transplanting; (3) Increasing fertilizer application, selecting fertile fields for planting, and applying one or two top dressings of quick-acting fertilizer in stages; (4) Preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, especially paying attention to the prevention and control of rice borers, rice water weevils, rice stink bugs, and rice blast, etc.

The special districts and counties generally actively and conscientiously implemented the spirit of the technical points put forward by the Provincial Agriculture Bureau on the cultivation techniques of Japonica rice. Various places held symposiums, held short-term training classes, and some conducted research at enlarged cadre meetings in counties, districts, and townships, and some also organized rural broadcasting stations to carry out publicity. All localities selected agricultural cooperatives with better conditions for promotion and planting. Most agricultural cooperatives planted it in high-yield fields. The agricultural cooperatives received the early Japonica rice seeds around March 20, and most of them were sown in the mud from March 27 to April 5, and transplanted from April 21 to early May. The seedling age was generally 25-28 days, the spacing between plants and rows was mostly 6×7 inches and 7×7 inches, and about ten seedlings were transplanted per bundle. In terms of fertilizer application, it was generally more than the local early indica rice, and some were one or two times more. After transplanting, one or two cultivations were generally carried out, combined with top dressing.

According to the reflections of cadres and the masses in various places, and our field inspections, the Japonica rice cultivation methods compiled and printed by the Agriculture Bureau itself had shortcomings and were not completely suitable for the early Japonica "Aomori No. 5." The leading departments at all levels did not supervise and inspect the implementation of Japonica rice cultivation techniques enough. Therefore, some areas did not do a good job in planting technology. The fertilizer used for early Japonica rice in Wang Haiping Agricultural Cooperative in Hanshou County was similar to that of indica rice. There were also cases where seedlings were transplanted in barren fields, or field management was not paid attention to, and no top dressing was applied.

Soon after transplanting (about 20 days), early Japonica "Aomori No. 5" showed signs of heading and flowering. After the Agriculture Bureau studied the reports from various places and relevant parties, it instructed various places to take remedial measures of top dressing. Some of the early Japonica rice fields in some cooperatives were top-dressed according to instructions, which promoted late tillering and strong panicles. However, a large part of the early Japonica rice fields lacked quick-acting fertilizer and had no fertilizer to apply; in addition, some cooperatives lost confidence in the yield increase of "Aomori No. 5" and did not apply top dressing even though they had fertilizer, so the growth was not good.

The plant height of "Aomori No. 5" was less than one foot, and some were only five to six inches high. Before tillering even started, some had signs of heading and flowering. Therefore, the masses doubted its yield increase effect and generally had complaints. The agricultural departments in various places also felt helpless.

Production Reduction Situation

Due to the abnormal growth and development of "Aomori No. 5," generally, heading was too early, the plants were short, the tillering ability was weak (generally about 15-16 plants per bundle on average), the panicles were short and the grains were few. Although the grains were relatively dense, there were quite a few unfilled grains (about 15%-30%, and up to 40% in some cases). And the heading was extremely uneven, with some grains in the same bundle already mature, some heading, some pregnant with panicles, and some even still flat grass. Therefore, the yield was generally very low.

According to the situation in various places, the growth of early Japonica "Aomori No. 5" was good in some cases and bad in most cases. The best individual plots had a yield of 990 jin per mu, and Liao Jia Cooperative in Xiangyin had 0.4 mu with a converted yield of 1,042 jin per mu, but this was extremely rare. Some had a yield of 500-600 jin per mu, and a considerable part had a yield of less than 100 jin per mu. Most of the yields were around 200 jin per mu. In the Xiangbei area, 200-300 jin was the majority. In the Xiangnan area, 100-200 jin was the majority.

For example, in Shaoshan Senior Cooperative, which was observed in Xiangtan Special District, a total of 110 mu of "Aomori No. 5" was planted, with an estimated average yield of 130 jin per mu. Compared with the local early indica rice yield of 500 jin, the yield was reduced by about 74%. Yingxin Senior Cooperative in Nanzhu Township, Xiangtan, planted a total of 200 mu of early Japonica rice, with an estimated average yield of 205 jin per mu. Compared with the local early indica rice average yield of 347 jin, the yield was reduced by about 40.9%.

According to preliminary statistics from the four special districts of Changde, Chenxian, Hengyang, and Xiangtan, a total of 200,7179 mu of early Japonica rice was planted. If calculated based on the actual area of early Japonica rice, the average yield per mu was 249 jin. If calculated based on the sown area, the average yield per mu was 213 jin. Compared with the average yield of 449 jin of early indica rice per mu in these areas, the yield was reduced by 52.7%, with a total reduction of about 45 million jin.

Public Reaction

The masses raised many criticisms about the large-scale promotion of "Aomori No. 5" without trial planting. Some cooperative members said: "The government has good intentions and wants us to increase production, but it should not promote seeds that have not been trial planted on a large scale." Some cooperative members complained to the cooperative cadres: "Without trial planting and without experience, the cooperative should not have planted so much Japonica rice." Some people in Hengyang area even composed a doggerel poem to sharply criticize the blind promotion of "Aomori No. 5": "The seeds come from afar, there is no grain and no management (the stalks are short), there was no trial planting beforehand, harming people is really not shallow."

In some cooperatives with severe losses, the members had great opinions about the cooperative cadres. Some complained: "The weather is good this year, and there is no increase in production by planting Japonica rice, wasting a year." In some areas, the masses saw that the rice could not grow and demanded replanting, but were opposed by the cadres. The masses complained: "You have harmed us for one season, and you still want to harm us for the second season." Some people in Leiyang County asked the technical cadres to compensate them for their losses, otherwise they would not give them food and would detain their luggage. Some cooperative members speculated: "The small cadres don't have the guts to get so many seeds, it must be the big cadres who did it."

"Aomori No. 5" can be sown and transplanted early, has the advantages of not rotting seedlings and not lodging, and has great potential for increasing production if there is sufficient fertilizer, and it matures early, which can adjust labor. Some people in the lakeside area reflected: "The rice seeds are good, but we just don't know how to plant them." Some also believe that "Aomori No. 5" requires a lot of fertilizer, has high costs, and low yields, so it is not cost-effective to plant it. Japonica rice requires a particularly large amount of fertilizer. The masses ridiculed: "Early Japonica rice can only be planted in the butt," and some said: "Japonica rice is good, but we can't afford to plant it," and some cooperative members complained: "It doesn't matter if the labor is spent, we can't even recover the fertilizer costs," such as the people in Liling County reflected: "The effort is doubled compared to planting indica rice, and the cost is increased by 50%-100%," and the farm in the county also said: "The cost per mu of early Japonica rice is 2 yuan more than indica rice."

Experience, Lessons, and Future Suggestions

The fundamental lesson of this serious production reduction incident of "Aomori No. 5" is that large-scale promotion was carried out without trial planting.

"Aomori No. 5" had never been trial planted in Hunan. The Provincial Agriculture Bureau only speculated that it could be demonstrated and promoted on a large scale in the lakeside area of Hunan based on the preliminary results of a small amount of experiments conducted by the Central China Agricultural Science Research Institute in Wuchang (without mature experience). It was said that trial planting demonstrations could be carried out in farms in mountainous and hilly areas in western Hunan and southern Hunan (actually, it was a province-wide promotion). This violated the central government's repeatedly emphasized policy that the promotion of improved varieties must be trial planted before promotion. The Hunan Provincial Agriculture Bureau's plan to transfer early Japonica rice seeds lacked a reliable basis. When promoting it, it was expanded from the lakeside area to the mountainous areas in western and southern Hunan, which aggravated the degree of loss.

The Ministry of Agriculture's approval of Hunan Province's allocation of "Aomori No. 5" was also not cautious enough. It did not adhere to the basic principle that trial planting must be carried out before promotion, and did not fulfill its responsibility of reviewing the "gate." The inspection team put forward the following suggestions for the future:

1. From the current situation, the serious production reduction caused by the promotion of early Japonica "Aomori No. 5" in Hunan this year has become a fact. The leading departments in Hunan Province should consider providing necessary care or subsidies to the agricultural cooperatives that have suffered production reductions based on various situations. At the same time, the work of persuasion and explanation should be strengthened. Relevant leading departments should also conduct a review of this matter and encourage the enthusiasm of the masses for production. In addition, improved varieties that have been scientifically identified and proven by practice to be truly suitable for promotion in the local area must still be vigorously publicized and actively promoted. The agricultural departments at all levels in Hunan Province must pay attention to overcoming certain negative emotions that may occur due to this error.

2. Based on the situation this year that a small number of "Aomori No. 5" grew well throughout the province, and most caused serious production reduction losses, this variety should not be promoted next year, but it can be trial planted. It is hoped that the relevant agricultural leading organs of this province will continue to conduct scientific identification of this variety and summarize cultivation experience, so as to put forward a practical plan for next year on this basis.

3. It is recommended that the agricultural department of Hunan Province comprehensively check and summarize the experience and lessons learned from the promotion of "Aomori No. 5" this year, improve the ideological understanding of cadres, and improve the work of promoting improved varieties.

    接受推广“青森五号”的教训
    为了弄清湖南省推广早粳“青森五号”造成减产损失的情况，监察部会同农业部组成检查组于6月下旬至7月下旬先后赴常德、郴县、衡阳、湘潭等四个专区和衡南、湘潭、衡阳市九个县（市）进行检查，联合检查组分别听取了各该专区和县的党政领导机关的情况介绍和意见，并重点深入了十八个农业社进行了实地观察和调查。
    种子调运推广经过
    湖南省农、粮两厅经中共湖南省委同意于去年12月31日致电农、粮两部，提出湖南省今年打算扩种粳稻二百万亩，并要求批准从辽宁、河北等地调运优良稻种共一千五百多万斤。今年1月上旬，农业厅抽派甘蜀村科长等四人，首先去华中农业科学研究所和湖北农业厅了解湖北历年对粳稻的试验试种经验，再去农业部请示调种问题，然后到辽宁、吉林进行种子检验调运。
    甘蜀村等到达东北同有关单位联系后，了解到辽宁、吉林只能拨给“元子二号”五万斤，“兴亚”、“卫国”等没有，但粳稻“青森五号”（商品粮）可以大量调运。于是甘蜀村便向湖南省农业厅汇报情况，并请示是否改调“青森五号”。农业厅领导干部召集有关人员研究后决定调“青森五号”三百万斤，并向农业部提出粳稻试种情况的书面报告，认为在湖南省发展粳稻是有条件的，提出要调“银坊”“元子二号”等一千二百十六万斤，“青森五号”三百万斤，在洞庭湖区进行较大面积示范推广，在山区丘陵区的各农场试种示范。
    农业部根据湖南的报告，电复湖南省农业厅，同意调拨。
    这批种子的分配的地区是：湘潭、常德、郴县、衡阳、邵阳、黔阳专区和湘西苗族自治州以及长沙、衡阳两市。分配种子的总数是三百零一万三千斤。这批种子的播种亩数共二十一万五千九百七十二亩。
    技术指导和生长情况
    湖南省各级农业部门对推广早粳都作了一般性的技术指导，并在生产会议上进行了研究，在报刊上做了宣传。他们拟定的技术要点的主要内容是：（1）晒种、盐水选种，提早播种，匀播稀播培育嫩壮秧；（2）早扦密扦；（3）增施肥料，选择肥田种植，并要分期追施一、二次速效肥料；（4）防治病虫害，特别要注意防治螟虫、稻包虫、稻椿象和稻热病等。
    各专、县对粳稻的栽培技术，一般都积极认真贯彻了省农业厅所提出的技术要点的精神，各地分别召开了座谈会，举办了短期训练班，有的在县区乡扩大干部会议上进行研究，有的还组织农村广播站进行了宣传。各地都选择条件较好的农业社推广种植。多数农业社都把它种植在丰产田里。各农业社于3月20日左右接到早粳稻种，3月27日至4月5日大部下泥，4月21日至5月初插秧，秧龄一般为二十五—二十八天，株行距大部分为6×7寸与7×7寸，每兜插秧十根左右，在施肥量上，一般比当地早籼稻要多，个别多到一、二倍。插秧以后，一般都进行了一、二次中耕，并结合进行了追肥。
    根据各地干部、群众的反映，和我们实地的视察，农业厅编印的粳稻裁培方法本身有缺点，不完全适宜于早粳“青森五号”，各级领导部门对贯彻粳稻的栽培技术，也督促检查不够，因此，有些地区没有作好种植技术工作。汉寿县王海坪农业社早粳稻施用的肥料与籼稻差不多。也有把秧插在瘦田里，或不注意田间管理，不施追肥的情况。
    早粳“青森五号”插秧后不久（二十天左右），即发现部分有打苞抽穗的现象。农业厅根据各地的报告，和有关方面研究后，即指示各地采取追肥补救的措施。有一部分社的早粳田，根据指示进行了追肥，促进了后期分蘖与壮苞。但有很大一部分早粳田因缺乏速效肥料无肥可追；另有一些社，因为对“青森五号”的增产失去信心，虽有肥料也没追施，因而成长不好。
    “青森五号”植株尚不到一尺高，有的仅五—六寸高，尚未开始分蘖，部分就有打苞抽穗的现象。因此群众对它的增产效果产生了怀疑，普遍有埋怨情绪。各地农业部门也都感到束手无策。
    减　产　情　况
    由于“青森五号”生长发育不正常，一般抽穗过早，植株矮小，分蘖力弱（一般每兜平均约15—16株），穗短粒少，虽着粒较密，但不实粒相当多（约占15％—30％，多的达40％），且抽穗迟早极为不齐，同一兜禾有的已经成熟，有的正在抽穗，有的在孕穗，甚至有的仍是扁草。因此，产量普遍很低。
    根据各地情况，早粳“青森五号”生长虽有好有坏，但好的是少数，坏的是多数。生长最好的个别丘块，亩产量有到九百九十斤的，湘阴廖家社有四分田折合亩产量一千零四十二斤，但这是极个别的。亩产五百—六百斤的有一部分，亩产一百斤以内的占相当一部分，大部分每亩产量在二百斤左右。湘北地区二、三百斤的是多数。湘南地区一、二百斤的是多数。
    如在湘潭专区实地观察的韶山高级社，共种“青森五号”一百一十亩，估计每亩平均产量一百三十斤，与当地早籼稻产量五百斤对比，约减产74％。湘潭南竹乡应新高级社，共种早粳二百亩，估计每亩平均产量为二百零五斤，与当地早籼稻平均产量三百四十七斤对比，约减产40.9％。
    根据常德、郴县、衡阳、湘潭四个专区的初步统计，共种早粳二十万零七千一百七十九亩，如按早粳实有面积计算，平均每亩产量二百四十九斤，按播种面积计算则每亩平均为二百十三斤，和这些地区的早籼稻每亩平均产量四百四十九斤对比，减产52.7％，共减产约四千五百万斤。
    群　众　反　映
    群众对没有经过试种就大量推广“青森五号”，提出了许多批评，有的社员说：“政府是好心好意，是为了我们增产，但不应该大面积推广没有经过试种的种子。”有些社员埋怨社干部说：“没有试过，又没有经验，社里就不应该种这样多粳稻”。衡阳地区有些群众还编了一首打油诗，对盲目推广“青森五号”进行尖锐的批评：“种子来得远，无谷又无管（禾秆短小），事先没试种，害人真不浅”。
    有些损失严重的社，社员对社干部的意见很大。有的埋怨说：“今年气候好，种粳稻没有增产，冤枉了一年”。有的地区群众看长不成要求翻耕受到干部反对，群众埋怨说：“害了我们一季，还要害我们第二季”。耒阳县有些群众要求技术干部赔偿他们的损失，否则不给饭吃，还要扣押行李。有的社员揣测说：“搞这样多的种子，小干部没有那么大的胆量，一定是大干部搞的”。
    “青森五号”能早播早插，有不烂秧、不倒伏的优点，肥料足的话增产潜力大，而且成熟早可以调节劳力。滨湖地区有些群众反映：“禾种是好的，就是不知道怎样种”。也有人认为“青森五号”需肥多，成本高，产量低，种它不合算。粳稻需肥特别多，群众讥讽说：“早粳只有插在屁眼里”，有的说：“粳稻好是好，就是种不起，”有的社员埋怨说：“花了人工不算不要紧，连花掉的肥料本钱都收不回”，如醴陵县群众反映：“工夫要比种籼稻增加一倍，成本要增加50％—100％，”该县农场也说：“早粳的每亩成本要比籼稻多二元”。
    经验教训和今后意见
    没有经过试种即大面积的推广，是造成这次“青森五号”严重减产事件的根本教训。
    “青森五号”在湖南从没有试种过，省农业厅仅根据华中农业科学研究所在武昌小量试验的初步结果（尚无成熟经验），即推测在湖南滨湖地区可以大面积的示范推广，在湘西、湘南山区及丘陵地区农场可以试种示范（实际上是在全省范围内遍地开花的推广），违犯了中央所一再强调的推广良种必须先经试种再行推广的方针。湖南省农业厅的调运早粳种子的计划的提出就缺乏可靠的根据，在推广时，又从滨湖地区扩大到湘西、湘南一带山区，更加重了损失的程度。
    农业部批准湖南省调拨“青森五号”也是欠慎重的，没有坚持必须先试种而后推广的基本原则，没有尽到审批“关口”的责任。检查组对今后提出如下几点意见：
    1、从目前情况看，湖南今年由于推广早粳“青森五号”而造成的严重减产已成事实。湖南省领导部门应当根据各种不同情况，对遭到减产的农业社考虑给予必要的照顾或补贴。同时应加强说服解释工作。有关领导部门还应当针对这一事情进行检讨，鼓励群众生产热情。另外，经过科学鉴定和实践证明确实可以在本地推广的优良品种，仍必须大力宣传，积极推广，湖南省的各级农业部门必须注意克服由于这一错误可能发生的某些消极情绪。
    2、根据今年全省“青森五号”少数生长较好，大部分造成严重减产损失的情况，这个品种明年仍不宜推广，但可以试种。希望这个省的有关农业领导机关，继续对这个品种进行科学鉴定和总结栽培经验，以便在此基础上，提出明年的切合实际的计划。
    3、建议湖南省农业部门，全面检查总结今年推广“青森五号”的经验教训，提高干部思想认识，改进良种推广工作。
