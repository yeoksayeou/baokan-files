Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st: Hong Kong news: Some of the Kuomintang flags carried by Kuomintang secret agents in the Kowloon riots had the words "Published by Taiwan Xingzhong Bookstore" printed next to the Kuomintang flag.
    Hong Kong's "New Evening News" revealed this news and published a sample of this Kuomintang flag.
    A news item on the fourth page of the Hong Kong "New Evening News" on October 19 stated: "During the Kowloon riots, a large portion of the paper flags that the rioters forced people to buy and paste were shipped from Taiwan. The image below is a reduced version of the Blue Sky White Sun flag 'Published by Taiwan Xingzhong Bookstore,' and the image on the left is a photograph of the original size of the words on the paper flag." A photo of the Kuomintang flag was published under the text, with an enlarged photo of the eight characters "Published by Taiwan Xingzhong Bookstore" attached to the lower left side of the photo.
    The news said: Some say the riots were organized by the Triads, and some say that there were indeed Triad members among the suspects accused of participating in the riots, but it is not true to say that the riots were organized by the Triads. The news said: "Just imagine, if the riots were really organized by the Triads, why wouldn't they rob more money and instead 'promote' paper flags for one dollar and fifty cents or five dollars and ten cents?" What sufficient reason is there to prove that the planning and command of these paper flags made in Taiwan, which fell into the hands of rioters to be forcibly sold and pasted, has nothing to do with special Kuomintang figures?
    This picture was supplied by a reader of this newspaper in response to a solicitation.

### 在九龙骚乱事件中  暴徒所持旗帜大部由台湾供应

    在九龙骚乱事件中
    暴徒所持旗帜大部由台湾供应
    新华社广州21日电　香港消息：国民党特务在九龙大骚乱中所持的部分国民党旗旁边印有“台湾兴中书局发行”字样。
    香港“新晚报”透露了这个消息并刊登了这幅国民党旗帜的式样。
    香港“新晚报”10月19日第四版上的一条消息说：“在这次九龙大骚乱中，暴徒强卖强贴的纸旗，有一大部分是从台湾运来供应的，下图是‘台湾兴中书局发行’的青天白日旗缩影，左图是纸旗上的字原样大小摄影”。这幅国民党旗的照片登于文下，照片左下侧附有“台湾兴中书局发行”八字的放大照片。
    消息说：有人说暴乱是黑社会主持，有人说事实上被控参加暴动的疑犯中确有黑社会人马在内，但说暴乱系由黑社会主持，则是不成立的。消息说：“试想如果真是黑社会在主持暴乱，他们为什么不去抢劫更多的钱还要一元五角或五元十元去‘推销’纸旗呢”？更有什么充分理由说明这批台湾制造的纸旗，落在暴徒手中强卖强贴与国民党特殊人物的策划与指挥毫无关系呢？
    这张图片是这家报纸的读者应征供给的。
