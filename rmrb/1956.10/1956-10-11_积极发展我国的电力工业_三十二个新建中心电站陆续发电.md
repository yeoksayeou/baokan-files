Xinhua News Agency, 10th - To date, of the sixty-nine central power stations scheduled to be built in China during the First Five-Year Plan period, sixty-three have already commenced construction, and thirty-two of these power stations have been fully or partially put into production.

From 1953 to the present, the newly added generating capacity of these power stations is equivalent to approximately 70% of the original generating capacity of the national state-owned electric power industry at the end of 1952. In conjunction with these power stations, more than two thousand nine hundred kilometers of transmission lines have been newly erected in various regions.

The majority of these power stations are distributed in China's concentrated industrial areas. For example, in the original industrial base – the Northeast – more than ten large generating units have been put into production in recent years, and the region's current power generation capacity has doubled compared to 1952. The current power supply capacity of the largest power grid in North China – the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan power grid – has also increased by approximately 50% compared to 1952.

In many emerging industrial cities – Lanzhou, Xi'an, Kunming, Chengdu, as well as Baotou, Luoyang, and other places – newly built and expanded power plants have also been continuously put into production in recent years. Consequently, the current installed generating capacity has increased several times over the past, ensuring the electricity needs for the basic construction of many newly built enterprises. New power stations are still under construction in these areas, and it is expected that some new generating units will be put into operation successively next year. The majority of these power stations were designed by the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democratic countries, and the equipment capacity is very large. Some also use the latest high-pressure and high-temperature boiler equipment and heating units, which can not only generate electricity and supply heat, but also save the cost of installing boiler equipment for nearby new enterprises and reduce coal consumption for power generation.

Although the amount of newly installed generating equipment in the coastal areas of East China in recent years has not been as much as in other regions, in addition to the Wangting Thermal Power Plant, which began construction on October 5, a large-scale hydroelectric power station is also under construction on the Xin'an River in Zhejiang. After completion, this hydropower station will be the center of a ultra-high-voltage power grid supplying Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou and other cities.

### 积极发展我国的电力工业  三十二个新建中心电站陆续发电

    积极发展我国的电力工业
    三十二个新建中心电站陆续发电
    新华社10日讯　到目前为止，我国规定在第一个五年计划时期内建设的六十九个中心电站，有六十三个已经开工，其中三十二个电站全部或部分投入了生产。
    从1953年到现在，这些电站新增加的发电设备容量，相当于1952年底全国国营电力工业原有发电设备容量的70％左右。同这些电站相适应，各地还新架设了两千九百多公里的输电线路。
    这些电站大部分分布在我国工业集中的地区。其中如原有的工业基地——东北，几年来就有十多套大型的发电设备投入生产，现在全地区的发电能力比1952年增加了一倍。华北区最大的电力网——（北）京（天）津唐（山）电网的目前供电能力，也比1952年增加了50％左右。
    在许多新兴的工业城市——兰州、西安、昆明、成都，以及包头、洛阳等地，这几年来也都有新建和扩建的电厂不断投入生产，因而使现在的发电设备容量，都比过去增加了好几倍，保证了许多新建企业基本建设用电的需要。现在这些地区还在建设新电站，预计在明年还有一些新建的发电设备陆续发电。这些电站大部分是委托苏联和东欧人民民主国家设计的，设备容量都很大；有的还采用了最新的高压高温锅炉设备和供热机组，不但能够发电、供热，同时还可以节省附近新建企业增设锅炉设备的费用和降低发电用煤的消耗。
    华东沿海地区最近几年来新安装的发电设备虽然不及其他地区多，但现在除了在10月5日开始施工的望亭火力发电厂以外，还正在浙江的新安江上着手建设一座规模很大的水力发电站。建成以后，将以这个水电站为中心组成一个沪宁杭超高压的大电力网，供应上海、南京、杭州等城市用电。
