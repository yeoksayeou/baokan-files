The World of Salt
——Second Communication from Qaidam
By Our Correspondent Gu Lei

In Xining, I was astonished by a fact mentioned in an article in the Qinghai Daily. A people's representative stated at the Provincial People's Congress: according to the preliminary survey of the three salt lakes in the basin, the salt reserves are enough for 600 million people nationwide (consuming ten jin per person per year) to eat for 8,690 years. After reading this, I felt that this calculation might be an exaggeration. Lacking any reason to dispute it, I wanted to enter the basin quickly, especially to see the Chaka Salt Lake first.

The car sped like an arrow. Xining is 297 kilometers from Chaka, a ride that takes a full day by bus, but we were in a smaller car, so we traveled faster. We departed from Xining at 7:30 AM and reached Daotanghe by 10:00 AM, covering 120 kilometers. The name of this place comes from the saying, "All rivers in the world flow east, but this water flows west." After traveling another ten kilometers or so, a slightly undulating deep green band appeared faintly to the northwest, shimmering in the sunlight. This was Qinghai Lake. Soon, the car reached the lake shore and traveled along it. At the closest point, we could see the waves frequently lapping against the rocks and grass on the shore. Lake Heart Mountain stood in the distant center of the sea, like several huge, sharply edged, snow-white jades inserted into the sea. Unfortunately, compared to the lake area of over 4,222 square kilometers, it seemed too small, like a few white sails on the sea. Legend has it that in ancient times, someone grazed mares on Lake Heart Mountain. The mares conceived with dragon seed and gave birth to horses that could travel a thousand miles a day, called "Qinghai Cong," so Lake Heart Mountain is also called "Dragon Colt Island." Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty did such a foolish thing, releasing mares on this mountain to seek dragon seed. In the past, horses that could travel a thousand miles a day never existed, it was just fantasy. Today, we are riding the steel "thousand-mile colt"—the car—to Qaidam. At this time, I had no intention of carefully observing the herds by the lake, admiring the beautiful scenery of the surrounding lush grass, or listening to the songs of the herdsmen. I wanted to get to Chaka as soon as possible.

After crossing the Rubber Mountain, which stands at an altitude of 3,800 meters, we saw the salt lake when we were more than 30 kilometers from Chaka. What a magnificent and spectacular scene! Looking out, the lake and sky were one color, and the lake surface shimmered with dazzling white light, illuminating the surrounding mountains and grasslands with unusual clarity. It looked like a huge, radiant source of light. The car arrived in Chaka just as the setting sun was about to disappear into the earth. The salt lake was eight kilometers from where we were staying, so I immediately took a car to the lake shore. Dusk also arrived on the lake, and the salt miners had already finished their work. I had no choice but to stand on the lake shore and look at the solidified salt lake and the small mountain-like piles of granular salt beside me. Then I went to find the responsible comrade of the salt factory.

Factory Director Zhao Qitai was very enthusiastic. From his conversation, I learned about the general situation of the salt lake.

The salt lake is seventeen kilometers long from east to west, nine kilometers wide from north to south, totaling 104 square kilometers. The reserves are 500 million tons. The deepest part of the salt layer is sixteen meters thick, and the average is four to five meters. Production is entirely manual, using drills, salt scoops, and shovels. Each worker has a quota of three tons per day, and some workers can dig six and a half tons. It is transported and sold to Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, and other places by trucks from the lake, making transportation costs too high. Last year, the cost of digging 100 jin of salt in the lake was 4.2 fen. However, the freight for transporting 100 jin of salt from the lake to the shore was 1 jiao 5 fen, and it was even more expensive to transport it elsewhere.

The salt here has many characteristics: the sodium chloride content is high, averaging over 98%. It is naturally crystallized and can be produced even when it rains; it regenerates quickly. When the salt is dug out, the water inside forms salt flowers as soon as it is exposed to the sun, and it crystallizes quickly. It truly can never be exhausted!

Like the entire Qaidam, Chaka Salt Lake had been abandoned for many years. In the twenty-eighth year of Qianlong's reign in the Qing Dynasty, the rulers of Xining had already established salt laws for Chaka, and salt taxes were collected. When Ma Bufang ruled Qinghai, he also plundered some gold and silver from here. However, for one or two hundred years, it was mostly freely mined by local herders. The salt they mined, after paying taxes, left very little, so although salt had been mined for a long time, the amount extracted was only a "drop in the bucket" compared to the salt lake's reserves. After the liberation of Qinghai, this sea of silver shone with light. In 1954, more than 10,000 tons of salt were produced, and by 1956, it was 187,500 tons. The number of salt miners also increased from 50 to 450.

Factory Director Zhao Qitai is from Ledu County, Qinghai. In 1946, under the duress of Ma Bufang, he left his hometown and joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army, fighting in the Jin-Sui area. His longing for his hometown made him brave in battle. After the revolution, he returned home and went to work at the Chaka Salt Lake, diligently managing this small enterprise with everyone. In the beginning, transportation here was inconvenient, and salt production could not be increased. Living conditions were also poor, living in a few broken houses, without vegetables to eat or coal to burn. However, he believed that one day the scale of production would expand, and Chaka would become lively. That day finally came! The roads were clear, and thousands of people flocked to the Qaidam Basin. Geologists found various mineral deposits in the basin. The surveying work for the new railway line had crossed the salt lake, and a salt resource exploration team had been sent from Beijing. Construction life in the Qaidam Basin was boiling! Although Chaka's salt is only part of the basin's wealth, it is a great part. Because the work of selecting the site for the salt factory has already begun here! They are now busy building houses, preparing to accept even greater tasks.

The next morning, I bid farewell to Chaka. There are two roads from here into the basin. One road goes southwest, along the eastern and southern edges of the basin, passing through Chaha Wusu, Xiangride, Garmu, to Mangya. The other road goes northwest, along the northern edge of the basin, passing through Xiligou, Delingha, Dachaidan, to Lenghu. Therefore, Chaka has always been known as the throat path from the east into the basin. We took the northern road, and the car headed towards Xiligou. At this time, I always felt that the car was moving too slowly. Because, when I visited Director Qiao of the Qinghai Salt Affairs Bureau in Xining, he told me that a new Keke Salt Lake had been discovered more than 80 kilometers from Chaka, not far from Xiligou. The roughly measured area is 175 square kilometers, and the estimated reserves are about 700 million tons. One drill hole was drilled to a depth of 18 meters and did not see water. The quality of the salt is the same as that of the Chaka Salt Lake. As soon as the car passed Xiligou, we saw the salt lake in the distance, lying quietly next to a large mountain, shimmering with silver light. It is said that a salt resource exploration team is working intensely on this lake.

What I heard in Xining and saw in Chaka and Xiligou made me believe the claim that the reserves of the three salt lakes in the basin could supply the entire country with salt for more than 8,000 years. The three salt lakes refer to Chaka, Keke, and Chaqan, the latter being much larger than the former two combined. In Xining, the most discussion and most poetic descriptions were about the Chaqan Salt Lake. This salt lake lies in the central-northern part of the basin, between Dabuxun Lake and Hobxun Lake, 65 kilometers south of Garmu. The total area of the lake is 1,550 square kilometers, the salt layer thickness is generally 8 meters, and the center of the lake is 18 meters. The "salt bridge," which has been praised and beautified in the basin, is built on this lake. When building the Dunhuang-Dachaidan-Garmu highway, because detours were inconvenient, it was simply built across the lake, with the road entirely paved with salt, connecting the two sides of the lake. On this road, cars travel at high speed. Some people joked that a paifang should be erected at the head of the bridge, with a couplet written in large characters: the first line is "The bridge is 10,400 zhang long," and the second line is "The speed limit is 80 kilometers per hour." The scale is terrifying. Preliminary estimates of the salt reserves of the Chaqan Salt Lake are 25 billion tons. More valuable is that the salt here contains more than 40 kinds of chemical elements such as potassium, making it a good raw material for the chemical industry.

In fact, the salt production of Qaidam is difficult to estimate. Qaidam is a Mongolian word, translated into Chinese as: Salt Marsh. Saltwater lakes are all over the basin. In the northern half, from east to west, there are Gahai, Toson Lake, Baga Qaidam Lake, Ike Qaidam Lake, Dezunmahai, Sugan Lake, and Lenghu; in the southern half, from west to east, there are Gezi Kule Lake, West Taijinaier Lake, Dabuxun Lake, and Hobxun Lake. The edges of some lakes have already solidified into a ring of crystalline salt, like a silver bracelet set on the lake, from which a large amount of salt can be extracted. People who have been to Qaidam often take rock salt from the basin as souvenirs for friends or relatives. This is a transparent, large piece of crystalline substance that does not appear to have particles. Some people call it "crystal salt" or "glass salt," and it comes in white and red colors. The ingredients contained are the same as lake salt. According to the information currently obtained by geologists, this salt is produced near Mangya. There is a mine south of Mangya, and the salt mine is distributed in mountain layers that are 100 kilometers long from north to south and 80 kilometers wide from east to west. It is still difficult to estimate how large the reserves are. Therefore, "Salt Capital" has become another code name for the Qaidam Basin.

I remember that on the day we departed from Chaka, the task for the road was 240 kilometers. On the way, everyone in the car talked about lake salt, rock salt, and the richness and diversity of the basin's treasures. It was not until the car entered Yematan that everyone's interest in conversation was replaced by another topic. Yematan is between Xiligou and Delingha, with flat terrain and overgrown with weeds. In the past, herds of wild horses and wild sheep lived here. A few people in the car were entering Qaidam for the first time and kept talking about wanting to encounter wild horses and yellow sheep. The driver told us that because there were so many people coming and going, it was not easy to see them now. Just then, a small group of yellow sheep appeared in front. Everyone encouraged the driver to speed up and rush up, to see if he could run one over. The driver happily floored the accelerator, and the car rushed towards the yellow sheep at a speed of 80 kilometers per hour. The saying "Yellow sheep lift their hooves and exhaust the horse" is absolutely correct. These little things run as fast as bullets. Our car had to make a circle and return to the road, moving forward at a normal speed. At this time, Chaka was getting farther and farther away from us! (Qaidam, September 14)

    盐的世界
    ——柴达木通讯之二
    本报记者  顾雷
    在西宁时，我曾被青海日报上一篇文章中提到的一个事实惊住了。有一位人民代表在省人民代表大会上的发言中：根据对盆地三个盐池预查的结果，盐的储量可供全国六亿人口（每人每年吃十斤）吃八千六百九十年。看后，觉得这种计算可能有夸大之处，理由我是没有的，于是想很快进入盆地，特别是先到茶卡盐池看看。
    汽车跑起来像箭一样。西宁离茶卡二百九十七公里，坐大汽车要跑一天，我们乘的是小车，走的快一些。从西宁出发时间是七时半，十时便走了一百二十公里，到了倒淌河。这个地名是因为“天下河流皆东去，唯有此水向西流”而得的。又前行十余公里，行车的西北方向，隐隐出现一条凸起的深绿色的带子，在阳光的闪耀下，微微地跳动。这就是青海湖。不久，汽车便进到湖边，沿湖而行，离湖的最近处，可看见浪花频频地拍打岸边的石头、草地。湖心山，矗立在遥远的海中心，像几块巨大的峭棱雪白的玉石插在海中，可惜它和面积四千二百二十余平方公里的湖水比较显得太渺小，只像大海中的一点白帆。相传，古代有人牧牝马于湖心山，马得龙种怀孕，生下的马日行千里，名叫“青海骢”，所以湖心山又叫“龙驹岛”。隋炀帝就干过这种傻事，曾放牝马在这个山上，求过龙种。过去，不管在什么时候，日行千里的马从来是没有的，不过是幻想。今天，我们正乘坐着钢铁的“千里驹”——汽车驶往柴达木。这时，我无心细看湖边上的牧群、欣赏周围水草丰美的景色、聆听牧民们的歌声，想尽快地到茶卡。
    越过拔海三千八百公尺的橡皮山；在离茶卡三十多公里的地方，就望见盐池了。这是一幅多么雄伟而壮丽的景色啊！看去，湖天一色，湖面闪烁着刺眼的白光，把周围的高山、草原照得异常明朗，它像一个散发光亮的巨大的源泉。车到茶卡，西下的红日已快掉进大地。盐池离我们要住宿的地方八公里，我立即乘车赶到湖边，黄昏同时也到了湖上，挖盐的人已经下工。我只得站在湖边看了看这凝固了的盐湖，和身旁小山一样的粒盐堆，便去找盐厂的负责同志去了。
    厂长赵启泰同志很热情。从他的谈话中我知道了盐池的概况。
    盐湖的面积东西十七公里长，南北九公里宽，总计一百零四平方公里。储量五亿吨。盐层厚度最深的十六公尺，一般的是四至五公尺。完全是手工生产，用钻子、盐勺和锨。每个工人一天定额是三吨，有的工人能挖到六吨半。运销青海、甘肃、陕西等地，用汽车由湖中向外运，运输成本太高。去年，在湖中挖一百斤盐，成本是四点二分。可是，由湖里运到岸上，每百斤盐的运费是一角五分，再运到别处更贵了。
    这里的盐有很多特点：含氯化钠高，平均在98％以上。它是天然结晶，下雨时也可以生产；更生的快，把盐挖出来，里边的水一见太阳就飘盐花，很快就结晶了。真是永远挖不完啊！
    茶卡盐池像整个柴达木一样，多少年来也被人遗弃了。清乾隆二十八年西宁的统治者对茶卡的盐已订有盐律，抽过盐税。马步芳统治青海时，也从这里搜刮了一些金银。但是，一两百年来，大都是由当地的牧民自由开采，他们挖的盐除去缴税外，剩下的很少，所以，尽管采盐的时间已很长久，采出的盐和盐池的储量相比，不过是“九牛一毛”。青海解放以后，这银的海洋，才射出光芒。1954年生产盐一万多吨，到1956年是十八万七千五百吨，采盐的工人也由五十个人发展到四百五十个人。
    厂长赵启泰同志是青海乐都县人。1946年，他在马步芳的逼迫下，走出了家乡，加入了中国人民解放军，转战在晋绥一带。对于故乡的怀念，使他作战时变得勇敢了。革命胜利了，他复员回乡，便到茶卡盐池工作，同大家一起辛辛苦苦地经营这个小小的企业。开始，这里交通不便，盐的产量一直无法增加。生活条件也很坏，住在几间破房子里，没有菜吃，没有煤烧。可是，他相信终会有一天，生产的规模会扩大，茶卡会变得热闹起来。这一天终于来了！公路畅通了，成千上万的人涌向柴达木盆地，地质人员在盆地找到了各种矿藏，新铁路线的勘测工作已越过盐池，北京派来了盐源勘探队，柴达木盆地的建设生活沸腾起来了！虽说茶卡的盐不过是盆地财富的一部分，但它是个伟大的部分。因为选择盐厂厂址的工作在这里已经开始了！他们现在正忙着建房屋，准备接受更大的任务。
    第二天早晨，我向茶卡告别了。由这里进盆地，有两条路。一条路向西南，沿盆地的东缘和南缘，经察哈乌苏、香日德、噶尔穆到芒崖。另一条路向西北，沿盆地的北缘，经希里沟、德令哈、大柴旦到冷湖。因此，茶卡一向被称为由东面进入盆地的咽喉路径。我们走北面一条路，汽车向希里沟进发。这时，我总嫌汽车走的太慢。因为，在西宁访问青海盐务管理局乔局长时，他告诉我离茶卡八十余公里、在希里沟不远的地方，新发现了一个柯柯盐池，草测的面积是一百七十五平方公里，估计储量约七亿吨。有一个钻眼打了十八公尺深还不见水，盐的质量和茶卡盐池一样。汽车刚过了希里沟，果然远远地看见了这个盐池，它静静地躺在一条大山旁边，银光闪闪。听说在这个湖上，一个盐源勘探队正在紧张地工作着。
    从西宁听到的和在茶卡和希里沟看到的，使我相信盆地三个盐池的储量可供全国人吃八千多年的说法。三个盐池是指的茶卡、柯柯、察尔汗，后者比前两个加起来还要大好多倍。在西宁，听到对察尔汗盐湖的谈论最多，也最富有诗意。这个盐湖在盆地的中部偏北，躺在达布逊湖、霍布逊湖之间，它南面的六十五公里处就是噶尔穆。湖的总面积是一千五百五十平方公里，盐层厚度一般是八公尺、湖心有十八公尺。在盆地中被传颂、美化了的“盐桥”就筑在这个湖上。修筑敦煌—大柴旦—噶尔穆公路时，因绕道不便，索性由湖上通过，道路全部用盐铺成，连接湖的两岸。在这条路上，汽车行走如飞。有人开玩笑说，应在这个桥头立一个牌楼，大字书写一副对联，上联是“桥长一万零四百丈”，下联是“时速限度八十公里”。气魄大的吓人。初步估计了察尔汗盐湖盐的储量是二百五十亿吨。更可贵的是这里的盐中，含有钾等化学元素四十多种，是很好的化学工业原料。
    其实，柴达木盐的产量是难以估计的。柴达木是蒙语，翻成汉语是：盐泽。咸水湖遍及盆地。北半部从东往西数，有尕海、托素湖、巴嘎柴达木湖、伊克柴达木湖、得尊马海、苏干湖、冷湖；南半部从西往东数，有格孜库勒湖、西台吉乃尔湖、达布逊湖、霍布逊湖。有些湖的边沿，已凝结了一圈结晶盐，像个银镯子套在湖上，从这里可以取出大量的盐。来过柴达木的人，还常把盆地里的岩盐拿去送给朋友或亲人作为纪念。这是一种透明的大块的、看不出有颗粒的结晶体，有人称它为“水晶盐”或“玻璃盐”，有白色的、红色的，所含成分和湖盐一样。根据地质人员现在获得的资料，这种盐产于芒崖附近。有一个矿在芒崖南面，盐矿分布在南北长一百公里、东西宽八十公里的山层里，至今尚难估计究竟有多大的储量。因此，“盐都”，又成为柴达木盆地的另一个代号了。
    记得，从茶卡出发那天，行路的任务是二百四十公里。路上，车里的人都不约而同地谈到湖盐、岩盐，谈到盆地宝藏的丰富、多样。直到汽车进入了野马滩，大家谈话的兴趣才被另一个题目代替。野马滩在希里沟和德令哈之间，地势平旷，野草丛生。过去，这里野马、野羊成群。车上有少数人是第一次进柴达木，总念叨着想碰见野马、黄羊。司机同志告诉我们，因为来往的人多，现在不容易看到了。就在这时，一小群黄羊出现在前面，大家鼓励司机开快车，往上闯，看能不能压死一个。司机高兴了把油门一脚踏到底，车子以每小时八十公里的速度向黄羊奔去。“黄羊抬蹄累死马”这句话一点不错，这小东西跑得像射出的弹丸那样快。我们的汽车只好绕了一个圈子，回到公路上，以正常的速度前进。这时，茶卡已离我们愈来愈远了！（9月14日柴达木）
