    Demanding Concrete Leadership
    Ye Cailin, Director of the Forging Workshop, Changsha Machine Tool Factory
    Our factory was formed after the liberation in 1949 by merging several dilapidated small factories. At that time, we could only do some repair work, and funds were very tight. In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Party, the workers have brought into play their enthusiasm and creativity, overcome difficulties, and made great progress. Now our factory is specializing in the manufacture of slotting machines, broaching machines, and hydraulic shaping machines. After the nationwide upsurge in industrial production arrived, the workers of our factory were greatly encouraged and raised the production plan three times. From January to July of this year, 996 rationalization proposals were put forward, equivalent to 6.8 times the total for the whole of last year. From January to July, the labor productivity fulfilled 108% of the plan, which was 137% of the same period last year. The total value of production also increased by 1.8 times compared with the same period last year.
    However, our factory is one of the factories with poor completion of the production plan in the national machine tool manufacturing industry this year, and the plan cannot be fully completed every month. Why is the plan not well completed? The main reason is that after opposing right-leaning conservatism, our factory itself has produced a tendency of blind advancement. For example, the factory renovation plan formulated in December last year originally required completion by May of this year. However, due to insufficient estimation of the difficult factors in factory design and construction material supply, the design of the main workshop of the assembly workshop was not finalized until May. The supply of steel bars could not keep up, and cement and wood were not allocated from the central government until April of this year. This forced the factory renovation project to be officially started in June. Also, this year's annual plan requires an increase in labor. It was originally estimated that this labor force could be supplemented from the society, but later all parties needed to increase labor, which caused our factory's plan to fail. The supply of tools and fixtures in the factory is also poorly organized. There is no time to manufacture them ourselves, and they cannot be bought on the market. The tool factory also does not take orders due to the task squeeze, resulting in the disconnection between tool supply and production tasks. In addition, the factory's weak technical strength and low technical level are also a major problem.
    We believe that the problems existing in the factory, in addition to the factory's own shortcomings, the higher-level leading organs also have responsibilities.
    First of all, the plan changes especially frequently. This year's plan is still changing, and the factory itself cannot grasp it. The personnel of the planning section are very tired, and the factory's leading cadres are also very distressed, and it is difficult to arrange work.
    In the upsurge of industrial production, the central competent departments and relevant departments lack comprehensive consideration of the balance between various factors in production. When issuing production plan indicators to enterprises, they did not consider the supply problem well, and we at the bottom only cared about production and relied on the above to solve the supply problem. As a result, the phenomenon of production and capital construction stoppage and waiting for materials was caused because the supply problem was not well resolved. This year, our factory still lacks a lot of steel, scrap steel, and coke, and even lacks more than 500 tons of pig iron.
    Some problems are not taken care of by the central and local governments, making enterprises feel at a loss. For example, the timber, scrap steel, and other materials allocated to us by the central government are not enough, and we are required to find local solutions, but the local government does not care. For example, on August 20, the foundry room had to stop the furnace due to the lack of scrap steel in the factory. We negotiated with the provincial and municipal party committees and the provincial and municipal planning commissions, but could not get a solution. The provincial and municipal planning commissions said that they only supply local state-owned and joint state-private factories, and cannot supply factories in the central system. We heard that a certain unit had scrap steel, but after several negotiations, we still could not get it.
    Now our factory is seizing the basic construction work of renovating the factory building, and the preparatory work for related production technology is also being carried out. Although the task is heavy and there are many difficulties, all employees of the factory are still confident in guaranteeing the completion of the annual national plan. It is requested that higher-level leading organs strengthen concrete leadership over enterprises, especially pay attention to helping backward enterprises. The division of labor between the central and local governments should be clear, and it is necessary to help enterprises solve concrete problems, and not form a situation where neither cares. The central government's plan for enterprises should be stable, and attention should be paid to balance. If these problems are not solved, our cause will suffer losses.

    要求具体领导 
    长沙机床厂锻工车间主任　叶财林
    我厂是1949年解放后由几个破烂的小厂子合并组成的，当时只能干一些修配活，资金也很困难。几年来，在党的正确领导下，职工们发挥了积极性和创造性，克服了困难，有了很大的发展。现在我厂是一个专门制造插床、拉床、液压牛头刨床的工厂。全国性的工业生产高潮到来后，我厂职工受到很大的鼓舞，曾将生产计划提高了三次，今年一至七月提出的合理化建议有九百九十六件，相当于去年全年的六点八倍；一至七月份劳动生产率完成计划的108％，为去年同期的137％；生产总值也比去年同期增加了一点八倍。
    但是，我厂今年在全国机床制造业中，却是生产计划完成得不好的厂子之一，月月都不能全面完成计划。为什么计划完成得不好呢？主要是因为我们厂子本身，在反对了右倾保守思想以后，又产生了盲目冒进的偏向。例如去年十二月制定的改建厂房计划，原来要求今年五月份就得完工。但是，由于对厂房设计、建筑材料供应等方面的困难因素估计不足，装配车间主要厂房的设计直到五月份才确定；钢筋供应不上，水泥、木材直到今年四月份才从中央分配下来一部分。这就迫使厂房改建工程不得不拖到六月份才能正式开工。又如今年的年度计划要增加劳动力，原来估计这些劳动力能够从社会上得到补充，但后来各方面都需要增加劳动力，致使我厂的计划落了空。厂内对工具、卡具的供应工作也组织得很差，自己制造来不及，市场上又买不到，工具厂也因任务挤不给订货，造成了工具供应和生产任务脱节。另外，工厂技术力量薄弱，技术水平低，也是一个很大的问题。
    我们认为厂内存在的这些问题，除了厂本身有缺点外，上级领导机关也有责任。
    首先是计划变动得特别多，今年的计划现在还在变，工厂本身没法掌握，计划科的人员都搞得很疲惫，厂的领导干部也感到很苦恼，不好安排工作。
    在工业生产高潮中，中央的主管部门和有关部门对生产中各个因素相互之间的平衡缺乏全面考虑，在下达企业生产计划指标的时候，没有很好地考虑供应问题，而我们下面也是只顾生产，依赖上面解决供应问题。结果，因为供应问题解决得不好，造成了生产和基本建设的停工待料现象。今年我厂需用的钢材、废钢、焦炭等都还缺得很多，甚至连生铁也还缺五百多吨。
    有些问题，中央和地方都不管，使企业感到不知所措。例如木材、废钢等物资，中央给我们分配的不够用，要我们找地方解决，而地方又不管。如八月二十日厂内因缺废钢，翻砂间要停炉，我们到省、市党委和省、市计委交涉，都得不到解决。省、市计委都说，他们只管供应地方国营和公私合营工厂，不能供应中央系统的工厂。我们听说某单位有废钢，几经交涉，也还是得不到解决。
    现在我厂正在抓紧改建厂房的基本建设工作，有关生产技术的准备工作也在抓紧进行。虽然任务很重，困难不少，但全厂职工还是有信心保证全年国家计划的完成。要求上级领导机关加强对企业的具体领导，特别是要注意帮助后进企业。中央和地方的分工要明确，要帮助企业解决具体问题，不要形成两不管，中央对企业计划要稳定，要注意平衡。不解决这些问题，我们的事业是会遭到损失的。
