In the birthplaces of new literature in both our Soviet Union and your China, stand two giants: Gorky and Lu Xun. Their glorious names are beloved by all the people in our country, so it is not surprising that these two names are often mentioned together.

In the words of our people, the founder of our Soviet literature, Maxim Gorky, is often called the petrel of the revolution, while the founder of new Chinese literature, Lu Xun, is called the helmsman of the cultural revolution by you. What greater praise can there be for a writer?

I have heard a Chinese proverb: A sage who knows everything is not as good as an ordinary person who accomplishes one thing with his own two hands. Gorky and Lu Xun were both sages, their keen eyes saw everything and saw far. But Gorky and Lu Xun were also great, diligent workers, who with their own two hands laid the foundations for new socialist literature in their respective countries. This realistic, inspiring, and fighting literature, like our bread and your rice, has become indispensable to the habits of life of millions of workers, whether here or there. These two giants, armed with the advanced world view of their time, served the people with their outstanding creations. They were tireless collectors of the power of new culture, a truly people's, revolutionary culture, a culture with bold ideas and great achievements, a culture unprecedented and unparalleled. As for the prosperity of this culture, we can observe it in your country, in our country, and in all socialist countries.

This is why we Soviet people are proud of our Gorky on the one hand, and cherish your Lu Xun on the other. Artists like these belong to the realm of world literature, and I think I have the same right as you to say: our Gorky, our Lu Xun.

I believe you will not find it strange if I say that Lu Xun is one of the most popular writers in our country. The Soviet people of my generation, as you can see from my appearance, are no longer young, but we loved his works when we were young. That was in the 1930s, when the first translations of his works appeared in our country. Now his works are very popular. Students read it, radio stations broadcast it, and theaters perform it. The popularity of the works of your, and also our, great writer Lu Xun can be illustrated by the fact that our largest publishing house undertook to publish his selected works, and the reservations for this book were filled within a few hours. I am not mistaken in saying a few hours. Is there any more accurate or clear expression of readers' care and love for a writer than this?

For us Soviet people, we respect Lu Xun not only because he is a writer whose works are worth reading over and over again; not only because he is a sharp literary critic and passionate political commentator who helps people understand the profound and greatness of unique Chinese culture; and not only because he is a smart folklorist who is good at carving the natural gems of folk creation and making them shine with colorful, rainbow-like brilliance. Lu Xun is also loved by us because he is a founder of friendship between the cultures of our two countries.

He was first an excellent foreign connoisseur and friend of Russian literature, and then of Soviet literature. In 1932, in his article "On the Intersection of Chinese and Russian Characters," he wrote: "...Russian literature is our teacher and friend. Because from it, we saw the kind souls, the bitterness, and the struggles of the oppressed; we also burned with hope along with the works of the 1840s, and felt sad along with the works of the 1860s." Lu Xun was a glorious patriot, and he was of course familiar with the Chinese saying "Tears cannot heal wounds." Therefore, he went on to write: "But I also learned magnanimity from Korolenko, and felt resistance from Gorky."

Now, when we see the long list of Russian classical works and Soviet literary works that were translated into Chinese by Lu Xun, proofread by him, or published in the magazines and anthologies he edited, we are truly amazed at how Lu Xun, a foreigner, was so good at selecting the best and most combative works from the treasury of literature. These works inspired people's consciousness, armed people to fight against imperialist oppressors and reactionaries, and conveyed socialist ideas and the great experience of the revolutionary struggle of Soviet workers who won victory under the leadership of the Communist Party of Lenin to China.

Lu Xun's name is a symbol of the traditional friendship between Chinese and Soviet literature, a symbol of our new cultural exchange, and a symbol of the brotherly feelings between the people of our two countries. This is why, when I was entrusted by our colleagues, the Soviet writers, to speak at this solemn meeting, I allowed myself to talk less about the distinct and prominent personality of the commemorated person, and instead talk about how one aspect of his life's work is being continued today.

Lu Xun has laid the foundation for the friendship between our two countries' literature. At this meeting, I would like to tell everyone that at present, the interest of our people in Chinese literature is rising like a spring tide.

Lu Xun's works have been published 34 times in our Soviet era, translated into 16 languages of various Soviet nationalities, with nearly 1.2 million copies printed. Guo Moruo's works have been published 12 times in seven languages, with nearly 400,000 copies printed. Mao Dun's works have been published 10 times in five languages, with a total of 120,000 copies printed, and Zhao Shuli's works have been published 16 times in seven languages, with nearly 50,000 copies printed. In order not to lull people to sleep with a series of numbers at this solemn meeting, I can briefly say that the works of Lao She, Liu Baiyu, and other Chinese writers and poets are widely read in our country. Those of you who have been guests in the Soviet Union have probably seen, or rather, felt this growing interest in Chinese literature, art, drama, and films, in short, in the life of brotherly China. I can even say that it is growing not arithmetically, but geometrically.

Comrade Zhou Yang wrote: Lu Xun is "an advocate and representative of socialist realism." He loved Soviet literature. As a Soviet writer, I am very happy to prove from this high platform that Lu Xun's love is the happiest kind of love, it is mutual love. There are many reasons for this reciprocity in our literary relations. First, because our literature is developing and prospering under the leadership of our Communist Party, because our literature is connected to our great people, because our writers have inherited the traditions of Gorky and Lu Xun and are concerned about the ideals and thoughts of the people, because our Soviet writers and your Chinese writers, let me use Comrade Mao Zedong's pertinent metaphor, do not want to "add flowers to the brocade" but first want to "send charcoal in the snow" to our readers, because our writers, of course I am referring to our advanced writers, are not indulging in fantasy but are down-to-earth, they are not curious tourists in life, not kind bystanders, but builders, soldiers, and enthusiastic promoters of the new things that happen in our lives every day.

Lu Xun has been dead for twenty years, but in this era of unprecedented victories in the cause of peace and socialism, we feel more than ever that he lives among us, he is a soldier among soldiers, a builder among builders. When talking about Lu Xun on this stage, I am not prepared to say, may he rest in peace, but to say: Long live our Comrade Lu Xun! Our Comrade Lu Xun will live forever in his immortal works, and live in the glorious cause inherited by his students.

    在首都的鲁迅逝世二十周年纪念会上
    苏联作家波列沃伊的讲话
    在我们苏联和你们中国新文学的发源地屹立着两个巨人，这就是高尔基和鲁迅。他们光辉的名字在我们国内受到了全民的爱戴，因此这两个名字时常被并列在一起是不足为奇的。
    在我国人民的言谈中，我们苏维埃文学的奠基者马克西姆·高尔基往往被称为革命的海燕，至于新中国文学的奠基者鲁迅则被你们称为文化革命的舵手。对一个作家来说，还有比这更崇高的称颂吗？
    我听说中国有句俗话：通晓万物的圣人还不如一个用自己一双手做成功一件事的普通人。高尔基和鲁迅都是圣贤，他们敏锐的眼睛看到了一切，并且看得很远。但是高尔基和鲁迅同时又是伟大的，孜孜不倦的劳动者，他们用自己的两只手在各自的国家内奠定了新的社会主义文学的基础，这种现实的，激发人心的战斗文学，正如我们的面包和你们的米饭那样，无论是在你们这里或是在我们那里，都已成为千百万劳动者生活习惯上所绝不可少的东西了。这两个由他们当代先进的世界观所武装起来的巨人曾以自己卓越的创作为人民服务。他们是新文化的力量的不倦的收集者，这种文化是真正人民的、革命的文化，是有着大胆构思和巨大成就的文化，是前所未见的、前所未有的文化。至于这种文化的繁荣，在你们国家里，在我们国家里以及在一切社会主义国家里，我们都可以观察得到的。
    我们苏联人民之所以一方面以自己的高尔基引为光荣，而同时又珍爱你们的鲁迅，就是这个道理。像这样的艺术家是属于世界文学的范畴的，我想，我和你们同样地有权这样说：我们的高尔基，我们的鲁迅。
    我相信，如果我说在我们国内鲁迅是最受欢迎的一位作家，你们一定不会觉得新奇的。我这一代的苏联人，你们看我的样子就可以知道，已经不年轻了，但我们在年青的时候就已热爱他的作品。那是在三十年代里，当时在我们国内还才出现他的著作的最初的译本。现在他的作品已是非常普及了。学生们读它，电台广播它，舞台上演它。你们的、也是我们的伟大作家鲁迅的作品之受人欢迎，可以用这样一件事情来说明：我们最大的出版社曾着手出版他的选集，在几小时之内，这部书的预约就已额满了。我说几小时并不是错误。难道读者对文学家的关心和热爱有比这表现得更确切、更明白的吗？
    对我们苏联人来说，我们敬爱鲁迅，不仅因为他是个作家，他的作品是百读不厌的；不仅因为他是个尖锐的文艺批评家和热情的政论家，他帮助人们理解着独特的中国文化的深奥和伟大；也不仅因为他是个聪明的民俗学者，善于把民间创作的天然宝石加以雕琢，使它发出五色缤纷如虹一般的光彩，鲁迅之所以被我们所敬爱，也在于他是我们两国文化的一个友谊的奠基者。
    他起先是俄国文学、随后是苏维埃文学的一个最优秀的外国鉴别家和朋友。1932年他在祝中俄文字之交这篇文章中写道：“……俄国文学是我们的导师和朋友。因为从那里面，看见了被压迫者的善良的灵魂，的辛酸，的挣扎；还和四十年代的作品一同烧起希望，和六十年代的作品一同感到悲哀”。鲁迅是一个光荣的爱国者，他当然很熟悉中国的一句俗话“眼泪医治不了创伤”。因此，他接着写道：“但也从珂罗连珂学得了宽宏，从高尔基感受了反抗。”
    现在，当我们看到由鲁迅译成中文、由他校订过或刊载在他所编的杂志上和选集中的那些俄罗斯古典著作以及苏联文学作品的长长书目时，我们真感到惊异，鲁迅，一个外国人，是多么善于在文学的总汇中选择出最好的、最有战斗性的作品。这些作品曾激发人民的自觉，曾武装人们向帝国主义压迫者及反动派进行斗争，曾把社会主义思想和在共产党的列宁式的领导下取得了胜利的苏维埃劳动者的革命斗争的伟大经验传达到中国来。
    鲁迅的名字是中苏两国文学传统友谊的象征，是我们新文化交流的象征，是我们两国人民兄弟般感情的象征。这也就是为什么我受了我们的同事，苏联作家们的委托，在这个庄严的大会上来讲话的时候，让自己少讲一些被纪念者的鲜明和突出的性格，而来谈谈他生平事业的一个方面现在是怎样被继续着。
    鲁迅已经奠定了我们两国文学的友谊的基础。在这个大会上，我想告诉大家，目前我国人民对中国文学的兴趣正像春潮那样高涨起来。
    鲁迅的作品在我们苏维埃时代出版了三十四次，它们被翻成十六种苏联各民族的文字，印了将近一百二十万册。郭沫若的著作用七种文字出版了十二次，印了将近四十万册。茅盾的著作用五种文字出版了十次，共印了十二万册，赵树理的作品用七种文字出版了十六次，印了将近五万册。为了不使一系列的数字在这个庄严的大会上催人欲睡，我可以简略地说，老舍、刘白羽以及其他中国作家和诗人的作品在我国是被广泛地阅读着。你们中间到苏联做过客的人大概看见过，更确切地说，大概感到过这种对中国文学、艺术、戏剧、电影的兴趣，总而言之，对兄弟般中国的生活的关心，是在不断地增长，我甚至可以这样说，它不是按算术级数，而是按几何级数增长着的。
    周扬同志写道：鲁迅是“社会主义现实主义的鼓吹者和代表者”。他热爱苏维埃文学。作为一个苏联作家，我很高兴在这个高高的讲台上来证明，鲁迅的爱是最幸福的一种爱，它是相互的爱。我们文学关系中的这种相互性是有它的许多原因的。首先因为我们的文学都是在我们共产党领导下发展和繁荣的，因为我们的文学是和自己伟大人民血肉相连的，因为我们的文学家是继承了高尔基和鲁迅的传统而关心人民的理想和思想的，因为我们苏联作家和你们中国作家们，让我用毛泽东同志那个中肯的比喻来说，都不想“锦上添花”而首先是要给我们的读者“雪中送炭”，因为我们的作家们，当然我是指我们先进作家们，不是耽于幻想而是脚踏实地，他们在生活中不是好奇的游客，不是善意的旁观者，而是建设者、是战士、是我们生活中每天发生的新事物的热烈的宣传者。
    鲁迅死了二十年了，但是目前在和平事业和社会主义事业取得空前胜利的时代，我们比过去任何时候更感觉到他生活在我们中间，他是生活在战士们中间的一个战士，是生活在建设者们中间的一个建设者。在这个讲台上谈到鲁迅的时候，我不预备说，祝他安息，而要说：我们的鲁迅同志万岁！我们的鲁迅同志永远生活在他的不朽的作品里，生活在由他的学生所继承着的光荣的事业里。
