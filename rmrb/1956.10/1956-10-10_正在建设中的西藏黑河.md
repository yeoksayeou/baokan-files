Xinhua News Agency, Heihe, 9th. Heihe, a vital town in northern Tibet, is rapidly changing its desolate appearance of thousands of years. Many wastelands inside and outside the town have been turned into construction sites. The eastern part of the town has become a key construction area, where chemical raw material plants, automobile transportation stations, meteorological stations, and staff dormitories are being built. Towering construction scaffolding, exposed new roofs, piles of wood, adobe bricks, and other construction materials, along with the busy labor of more than five hundred Tibetan and Han workers, demonstrate the scale and prospects of building this first new city on the northern Tibetan grassland.

People familiar with the situation in Heihe feel the value of this new change even more. They say that nearly a hundred tribes live scattered across the vast grasslands around Heihe. The Heihe area produces three to four million catties of wool and a large amount of butter, hides, and other livestock products every year, and the underground also contains rich mineral resources such as coal, iron, and oil. However, until liberation in 1951, there was no industrial construction here. Now, in less than two years, the new buildings that have appeared in Heihe are about to catch up with the total area of houses built in Heihe's history. With the development of construction, Heihe has gradually become the largest economic center and transportation hub on the northern Tibetan grassland. It is not only a major transfer station on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, but also the highways from Heihe to Ali and Heihe to Dingqing will soon be under construction, connecting Heihe with several other major pastoral areas in Tibet. Along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, automobiles continuously transport large quantities of grain, tea, and daily necessities. These materials are sold to various tribes through state-owned trading groups and Tibetan merchants. From January to September this year, the total value of tea transferred from Heihe to the pastoral areas reached more than 18 million yuan. The Heihe Branch of the State-owned Tibet Trading Corporation has signed wool purchase contracts with major tribes, and the livestock products that have been accumulated in the pastoral areas of Heihe for a long time have also begun to be transported and sold to the mainland. The Heihe market is becoming more prosperous day by day. People can buy hundreds of kinds of goods from the mainland here. Herdsmen far away in the Tanggula Mountains and the central Qiangtang also come to trade with livestock products, animal skins, lake salt, and other local specialties.

    正在建设中的西藏黑河
    新华社黑河9日电　西藏北部重镇黑河，正在迅速改变着千百年来的荒凉面貌。城内外不少荒地都变成了建筑场所。城东已成为重点建筑区，在这里动工兴建的有化工原料厂、汽车运输站、气象站和职工宿舍等。耸立的施工脚手架，突露的新屋顶，到处堆积着的木料、土坯等建筑器材，和五百多名藏族、汉族工人紧张劳动的情景，显示出建设这个藏北草原上第一座新城市的规模和前景。
    熟悉黑河情况的人们，格外感到这种新变化的可贵。他们说，在黑河周围广大的草原上散居着近百个部落。黑河地区每年要出产三、四百万斤羊毛和大量的酥油、皮张等畜产品，地下还蕴藏着煤、铁、石油等丰富的矿产。可是直到1951年解放时，这里没有一点工业建设。如今，仅仅在不到两年的时间里，在黑河出现的新建筑物就快要赶上黑河有史以来所建筑的房屋的总面积了。随着建设事业的发展，黑河逐渐成为藏北草原上最大的经济中心和交通枢纽。它不但是青藏公路线上的一个大转运站，而且向西向东即将动工修筑黑河到阿里和黑河到丁青的公路，这两条公路将把黑河和西藏其他几个主要牧区连接起来。沿着青藏公路，汽车不断运来大量的粮食、茶叶和日用品。这些物资通过国营贸易小组和藏族商人销售到各个部落里。今年1月到9月，从黑河调往牧区的茶叶总值即达一千八百多万元。国营西藏贸易总公司黑河分公司和各主要部落签订了羊毛收购合同，黑河地区各牧区长期积压的畜产品也开始运销内地。黑河市场一天比一天繁荣起来了。人们在这里可以买到好几百种内地货物。远在唐古拉山区和羌塘中部的牧民们，也带着畜产品和兽皮、湖盐等土产特产品前来交易。
