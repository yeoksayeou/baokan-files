After agricultural production cooperatives in various places vigorously developed diversified operations, the phenomenon of agricultural cooperatives squeezing out handicraft cooperatives has appeared in many places. If this phenomenon is not corrected in time, it will not only make the lives of members of handicraft cooperatives difficult, but also disrupt the division of labor and cooperation between rural subsidiary occupations and urban handicrafts, affecting the normal development of handicrafts and agriculture.

Should agricultural cooperatives develop handicrafts? Generally speaking, since some handicraft workers are scattered in rural areas, for the sake of convenience, they should and are willing to participate in agricultural cooperatives. In order to give play to the specialties of its members and to meet the needs within the cooperative for handicraft products, agricultural cooperatives should also engage in some handicraft activities. However, it is inappropriate for agricultural cooperatives to blindly develop handicrafts, and even set up retail departments in towns and cities. Agriculture and handicrafts are a social division of labor, with a certain proportion of practitioners in each field, and this proportion adapts to the needs of all aspects of society. If agricultural cooperatives blindly expand handicraft production, it will inevitably lead to the control of raw materials for handicrafts and the competition for the handicraft market, making those who originally engaged in handicrafts have nothing to do, disrupting the social division of labor, and destroying the original cooperative relationship. With the continuous development of production, it is also required that handicrafts increase products and improve quality, and therefore also improve technology. However, agricultural cooperatives are mainly engaged in agriculture, and improving the production technology of handicrafts is greatly limited. At the same time, handicraft production requires a separate set of business management, and agricultural cooperatives that operate too many handicrafts will inevitably divert some energy, not only making handicraft production poor, but also weakening agricultural production.

Of course, another tendency that currently exists in some areas is also undesirable. For example, some agricultural cooperatives restrict members who also engage in handicrafts too much, forcing them to participate in agricultural labor uniformly, or their remuneration is unreasonable. When they raise objections, they are casually labeled with big hats such as "selfish" and "backward." This will not give play to the enthusiasm of these members, give play to their specialties, and is not beneficial to either the cooperative or the members.

The correct way to deal with rural handicraft workers should be to treat them differently according to specific circumstances. For example, members who are mainly engaged in agriculture should participate in agricultural production organizations, under the unified leadership of the cooperative, and they should also be given a certain amount of time to engage in handicraft activities, with the income belonging to the individual. As for rural professional handicraft workers with higher skills, they can form separate professional groups within the agricultural cooperative, calculate remuneration separately, and be responsible for their own profits and losses. Agricultural cooperatives do not restrict them, but can require them to carry out the repair and manufacturing work needed by the cooperative, and pay reasonable remuneration. In this way, there will be no conflict between agriculture and handicrafts.

There is also a key issue here, that is, party and government workers must have a comprehensive perspective, and no matter what position they are in, they must proceed from the interests of the whole people when dealing with problems, and must not be partial. The poor relationship between some agricultural cooperatives in Feixi County, Anhui Province, and handicraft workers inside and outside the cooperative is related to the ideological understanding of some leading workers in Feixi County. These workers only attach importance to agricultural production and the consolidation and improvement of agricultural cooperatives, and neglect the care and support for handicraft workers, thus fueling the contradiction between agriculture and handicrafts. This deserves attention.

    农村副业和城镇手工业要分工协作
    慧之
    各地农业生产合作社大力发展多种经营以后，不少地方出现了农业社挤垮手工业合作社的现象。这种现象如不及时纠正，不仅使手工业社社员的生活发生困难，也会打乱农村副业和城镇手工业之间的分工协作关系，影响手工业和农业的正常发展。
    农业社应不应该发展手工业呢？一般说，由于有一部分手工业者分散在农村中，为了方便起见，他们应该也愿意参加农业社。农业社为了发挥社员特长和解决社内对手工业产品的需要，也应当有一些手工业活动。但是，如果农业社盲目地发展手工业，甚至到市镇上设立门市部那是不相宜的。农业和手工业是一种社会分工，各方面从业人员有一定的比例，这种比例是适应着社会各方面的需要的。如果农业社盲目扩大手工业生产，必然会发生控制手工业原料、争夺手工业市场，使原来经营手工业的人员无事可做，打乱社会分工，破坏原有的协作关系。在生产不断发展的情况下，也要求手工业增加产品，提高质量，因而也就要提高技术。而农业社是以经营农业为主，提高手工业的生产技术是受很大限制的。同时手工业生产需要一套单独的经营管理，农业社经营了太多的手工业就必然要分散一定的精力，不单手工业生产搞不好，也削弱了农业生产。
    当然，目前存在某些地区的另一种偏向，也是要不得的。比如有些农业社对兼营手工业的社员限制过死，强制他们一律参加农业劳动，或者对他们的报酬不合理。当他们提出意见时，又随便给加上“自私”、“落后”等大帽子。这样就不能发挥这些社员的积极性，发挥他们的专长，对社对社员都是不利的。
    正确处理农村手工业者的办法，应当是根据具体情况分别对待。比如以农业为主的社员，就应该参加农业生产组织，由社统一领导，同时也给他们一定的时间从事手工业活动，收入归个人所得。至于乡村技艺较高的专业性的手工业者，可以在农业社内组成单独的专业小组，单独计酬，自负盈亏。农业社不限制他们，但可以要求他们进行本社所需要的修理和制造工作，并且按合理的标准付给报酬。这样，农业和手工业就不会有矛盾了。
    这里还有一个关键问题，就是党政工作人员要有全面观点，不管自己站在什么岗位，处理问题的时候都要从全民利益出发，不能有所偏袒。安徽肥西县有些农业社同社内外手工业者的关系处得不好，和肥西县某些领导工作人员的思想认识有一定的关系。这些工作人员只重视农业生产和农业社的巩固提高，忽视了对手工业者的照顾和扶持，因而助长了农业和手工业之间的矛盾。这是值得注意的。
