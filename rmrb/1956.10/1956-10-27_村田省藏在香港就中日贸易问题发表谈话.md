Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 25th: Hong Kong dispatch: Murata Shozo, president of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and president of the Japan Commodity Exhibition, said to reporters yesterday while passing through Hong Kong on his way back to Japan, regarding Sino-Japanese trade issues: "Sino-Japanese trade has already increased substantially, and after the 'embargo' is lifted, there will be even greater increases. We need Chinese products, and China also needs our products. It is truly unreasonable to restrict trade between countries. We have been striving to lift the restrictions, and now the U.S. government should take steps. Western European countries such as Britain and France, as well as Japan, have suffered from the 'embargo,' especially Japan, because China is not only a market for Japan, but also a supplier of many raw materials needed by Japan. The United States has antipathy towards China, but we have no antipathy towards China. While this antipathy exists, it is difficult to lift the embargo. Even so, this issue will eventually be resolved one day."

Murata Shozo also said that the Japanese Commodity Exhibition currently being held in Beijing has received great attention and welcome. At the exhibition, Japanese businessmen have already begun trade negotiations and contract signing with the Chinese side.

    村田省藏在香港就中日贸易问题发表谈话
    新华社广州25日电　香港消息：日本国际贸易促进协会会长、日本商品展览会总裁村田省藏昨天路过香港回国时，就中日贸易问题对报纸记者发表谈话说：“中日贸易现在已有大量增加，‘禁运’解除后，还会有更大的增加。我们需要中国的产品，中国也需要我们的产品，限制国与国间的贸易实在不合理。我们一直在争取解除限制，现在应该由美国政府来采取步骤了。英法等西欧国家及日本都已吃了‘禁运’的苦头，尤其是日本，因为中国不但是日本的市场，也是日本所需许多原料的供应者。美国对中国有恶感，我们对中国没有恶感。在这种恶感存在期间，想要解除禁运是有困难的。即使如此，这个问题终有解决的一天。”
    村田省藏还说，目前在北京举办的日本商品展览会受到了很大的注意和欢迎，在展览会中，日本商人已开始和中国方面进行贸易商谈和订定合同。
