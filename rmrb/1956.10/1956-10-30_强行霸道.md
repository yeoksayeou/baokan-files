Forcible Bullying
    Hu Daoyuan
    Recently, some production cooperatives have often encountered aggressive and domineering buyers after their products are made.

    The Wanghe Bamboo Mat Production Cooperative in Qianshan County, Anhui Province, produces bamboo mats that cost 17.75 yuan each. However, the Anqing Daily Necessities Wholesale Station of the Anhui Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative reduced the purchase price to 10.40 yuan each. Because the bamboo mat cooperative was losing too much money, it had to ask the Provincial Handicraft Industry Federation to introduce and transport 200 mats to Shanghai for trial sales. At this time, the Anqing Daily Necessities Wholesale Station, through the Shanghai Working Group of the Anhui Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, colluded with the Shanghai Daily Necessities Wholesale Station of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, refusing to approve their prices and prohibiting merchants from buying their mats. In the end, the bamboo mat cooperative was forced to transport the mats back and sell them to the Anqing Daily Necessities Wholesale Station at a painful price of 9.35 yuan each. The Tiemu Production Cooperative in Huangying District, Lianshui County, Jiangsu Province, set up its own stalls to sell small farm tools, but the local supply and marketing cooperative confiscated their products.

    Speaking of these examples, one cannot help but think of the so-called brokers in the markets of the old society. They held the power to determine commodity prices, and any commodity that had not been priced by the brokers could not be sold in the local market. They were afraid that commodity producers would not suffer enough losses, and they used all kinds of selfish methods. Isn't the behavior of these supply and marketing cooperatives towards handicraft cooperatives the same as the style of these brokers?

    Perhaps some people will say: such a comparison is excessive. Because supply and marketing cooperatives are socialist economic organizations, no matter what method they use to obtain handling fees and profits, they are ultimately owned by the state and the collective. I think that precisely because supply and marketing cooperatives are socialist economic organizations, they should not only seek profits for their own units, regardless of the profits and losses of other units. At present, handicraft cooperatives generally do not have much capital, and their profits are relatively small, and the living standards of handicraftsmen are not high. In this case, supply and marketing cooperatives, which are as closely related as brothers, should actively help them in many ways. However, these supply and marketing cooperatives have reduced the purchase price to more than one-third lower than the cost of handicraft cooperatives, and they do not allow them to sell their own products or purchase raw materials. As a result, handicraft cooperatives are forced to lose money and stop production, and they cannot maintain themselves! Isn't this kind of selfish behavior a fundamental forgetting that they are socialist economic organizations?

    Supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives are both collectively owned economic organizations of the working people, and their status is equal. When business relations occur between them, they should act in accordance with the contract; anything outside the scope of the contract, neither party should interfere. May I ask, when the handicraft cooperative transports its products to other places for trial sales through formal procedures, what right does the supply and marketing cooperative have to interfere?

    强行霸道
    胡道源
    最近，有些生产合作社制出产品以后，经常遇到横行霸道的收购者。
    安徽省潜山县王河竹席生产合作社生产的竹席，每条成本十七元七角五分，但是安徽省供销合作社安庆日用杂品批发站竟把收购价格压到十元四角一条。竹席社因为亏本太多，只得请省手工业联社介绍运送二百条往上海试销。这时，安庆日用杂品批发站又通过安徽省供销合作社驻沪工作组，串通全国供销合作总社上海日用杂品批发站，不给他们核价；不许席商买他们的席子。最后，迫使竹席社不得不把席子运回，忍痛以每条九元三角五分的价格卖给安庆日用杂品批发站。江苏省涟水县黄营区铁木生产合作社自己摆摊出售小农具，而当地的供销合作社竟没收了他们的产品。
    谈起这些事例，不禁想起了旧社会的市集上的所谓经纪人。他们掌握着核定商品价格的大权，凡是没有经过经纪人核价的商品，就不能在当地市场上出卖；他们惟恐商品生产者吃亏吃得少，什么损人利己的办法都用得出来。这几个供销合作社对待手工业合作社的行为，不正是同这种经纪人的作风一样吗？
    也许有人会说：这样比方，未免过分。因为供销合作社是社会主义性质的经济组织，不管它用什么样的方式取得手续费和利润，最终都是归国家和集体所有。我觉得，正因为供销合作社是社会主义性质的经济组织，更不应当只贪图为本单位谋取利润，不顾其它单位的盈亏。目前手工业社一般的资金都不多，利润比较少，手工业者的生活水平是不高的。在这种情况下，像兄弟一样休戚相关的供销合作社，正应该从多方面想办法来积极扶助它。但是，这些供销合作社，竟把收购价格压得比手工业合作社的成本还低三分之一以上，又不许他们自己销售产品、收购原料。结果逼得手工业社亏本、停产，弄到无法维持的地步！这种用损人利己的行为，不是根本忘记了自己是社会主义性质的经济组织吗？
    供销合作社和手工业合作社同是劳动人民集体所有的经济组织，地位是平等的。彼此间发生业务关系的时候，应该按照合同办事；凡是在合同范围以外的，双方都不应当去干涉。试问，当手工业合作社通过正式手续把产品运往外地试销的时候，供销合作社有什么权利去干涉呢？
