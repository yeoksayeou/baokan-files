Xinhua News Agency, 30th - According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Bangkok: Thai Foreign Minister Naradhip said on September 29th that it is necessary for Thailand to sign a special agreement with the United States on the status of US troops stationed in Thailand.

    Naradhip made these remarks amidst rising public anger in Thailand over the atrocities committed by US troops stationed in Thailand. Thai public opinion has strongly criticized the incident on September 17th in which five American soldiers vandalized a gas station in downtown Bangkok and assaulted three Thai citizens.

    The five American soldiers who committed the violence belonged to the US military attache's office in Thailand. Although the US Embassy in Thailand has agreed to compensate for the losses, it has refused to hand over these violent American soldiers to the Thai authorities for handling, citing diplomatic immunity.
