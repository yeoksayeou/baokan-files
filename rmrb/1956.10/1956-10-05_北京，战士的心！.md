    Beijing, Heart of the Soldier!
    Zhang Yongmei
    In the smoke-filled battlefield, the commander issued the order to charge, we shouted your name: Beijing! Beijing! We passed through the rain of bullets and the forest of guns; Beijing! Beijing! What could stop us? It is you who encourage us to be victorious in every battle!
  Beijing, Heart of the Soldier! When the martyrs were sacrificing themselves, they thought of beloved Beijing, they shouted your name: Beijing! Beijing! Like calling out to our dear mother; Beijing! Beijing! It was you who helped them conquer death, and because of you, they achieved eternal life!
  Beijing, Heart of the Soldier! In the most dangerous and difficult moments, your name is also the loudest, because in this glorious place,
  (Beijing! Beijing!) there is our beloved Party Central Committee,
  (Beijing! Beijing!) it is you who turn danger into safety, it is you who open the door to victory!
  Beijing, Heart of the Soldier! When the flag of victory is flying, we think of Tiananmen Square, as if walking on every street of yours,
  (Beijing! Beijing!) everywhere is brilliant light,
  (Beijing! Beijing!) we shed tears because we miss you, you are our common hometown!
  Beijing, Heart of the Soldier!

    北京，战士的心！
    张永枚在硝烟弥漫的战场上，指挥员发出了冲击的命令，我们高呼着你的名字：北京！北京！穿过了弹雨和枪林；北京！北京！有什么能够阻挡我们？是你鼓舞我们百战百胜！
  北京，战士的心！当烈士在牺牲的时刻，想起了亲爱的北京，他们高呼着你的名字：北京！北京！好像呼唤亲爱的母亲；北京！北京！是你帮他们战胜了死亡，因为你而得到了永生！
  北京，战士的心！在最危险最困难的时刻，你的名字也最响亮，因为在这光荣的地方，
  （北京！北京！）有我们亲爱的党中央，
  （北京！北京！）是你让危险变为平安，是你把胜利的大门开放！
  北京，战士的心！当胜利的旗帜飞扬，我们想念着天安门广场，好像走在你的每一条街道，
  （北京！北京！）到处是辉煌的灯光，
  （北京！北京！）我们因想念你而流出了眼泪，你是我们共同的故乡！
  北京，战士的心！
