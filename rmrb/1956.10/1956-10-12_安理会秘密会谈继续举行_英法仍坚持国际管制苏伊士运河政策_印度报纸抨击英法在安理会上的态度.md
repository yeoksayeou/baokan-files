Xinhua News Agency, New York, 11th - Secret talks between the Foreign Ministers of Britain, France, and Egypt, and UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld continued on the 10th.

Bineau stated after the talks that the secret talks had not yet reached a stage where a report could be made to the Security Council. According to Agence France-Presse, Bineau defended the Anglo-French proposal during the talks. He also stated that he is currently not authorized to negotiate on any basis other than the international administration of the Suez Canal.

Soueïd also repeatedly said after the talks: "British policy has not changed. Britain has no new plans."

Secret talks continued before today's Security Council meeting.

Prior to the secret talks on the 10th, Soueïd and Bineau held separate talks and issued a joint communiqué stating: "They will continue to work together to seek a solution based on the principles proposed by the eighteen countries." The communiqué also denied any differences of opinion between Britain and France.

In addition, Lloyd and Bineau also met with Dulles before he went to Washington to meet with Eisenhower.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 11th - The Indian "National Herald" criticized the attitude of the representatives of Britain and France at the United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss the Suez Canal issue on October 10th.

The newspaper said that it is possible to seek a solution through negotiations based on the principles put forward by Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi. Egypt has made sincere efforts to accommodate the views of Britain and France. Now it is up to Britain and France to move closer to Egypt.

The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" said, "If Western countries, especially Britain and France, insist on their own solutions, then no solution can be reached in the United Nations."

The newspaper believes that "if Britain and France want a peaceful solution to the problem, they must clearly make concessions in any negotiations that may take place in the Security Council's secret meetings."

    安理会秘密会谈继续举行
    英法仍坚持国际管制苏伊士运河政策  印度报纸抨击英法在安理会上的态度
    新华社11日讯　纽约消息：英、法和埃及外交部长以及联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的秘密会谈10日继续举行。
    比诺在会谈后表示，秘密会谈还没有达到一个可以向安全理事会作出报告的阶段。据法新社消息说，比诺在会谈中曾经为英法提案辩护。他还表示，他目前无权在除了国际管理苏伊士运河以外的任何其他基础上进行谈判。
    苏埃德在会谈后也连声说：“英国政策没有改变。英国没有新计划。”
    秘密会谈在今天安全理事会会议以前又继续举行。
    在10日的秘密会谈举行之前，苏埃德和比诺曾经单独举行了会谈，并且发表联合公报说：“他们将继续共同努力寻求一个以十八国建议提出的原则为基础的解决办法。”公报还否认英法意见有分歧。
    此外，劳埃德和比诺在杜勒斯去华盛顿同艾森豪威尔会面之前，还同他见了面。
    据新华社新德里11日电　印度“国民先驱报”在10月10日抨击英国和法国的代表在联合国安全理事会讨论苏伊士运河问题的会议上的态度。
    这家报纸说，以埃及外交部长法齐提出的原则为基础通过谈判谋求解决是可能的。埃及已经作了真诚的努力来照顾英国和法国的意见。现在是要英国和法国向埃及靠近了。
    “甘露市场报”说，“如果西方国家，特别是英国和法国坚持它们自己的解决办法，那么在联合国里就不能达成任何解决”。
    这家报纸认为，“英国和法国如果想和平解决问题，它们显然必须在安全理事会秘密会议上可能进行的任何谈判中让步”。
