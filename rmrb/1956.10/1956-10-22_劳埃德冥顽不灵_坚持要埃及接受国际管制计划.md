Xinhua News Agency, October 21st: Liverpool dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, in a speech at a Conservative Party rally in Liverpool on October 20th, reiterated that the British government insists on the "international control" canal plan, which was vetoed in the Security Council, as the basis for negotiations with Egypt.

Lloyd said that the proposals put forward by Britain and France in the United Nations Security Council were the "limit of reconciliation" that the two countries could make. On the one hand, he stated that the "six principles" adopted by the Security Council were a "great step forward," but on the other hand, he insisted that Egypt first put forward specific suggestions, and that these suggestions "must provide canal users with effective guarantees no less than those contained in the original eighteen-nation proposal."

Lloyd said that the British government is willing to negotiate with Egyptian representatives, "as long as Egypt's proposals conform to the second part of the proposals submitted by Britain and France to the Security Council." This part was precisely what the Security Council rejected, which stipulated the establishment of an "international control" system over the Suez Canal.

Lloyd said that the British authorities cannot "concede" on the "principle" that the Suez Canal cannot be allowed to be controlled by one government.

Lloyd also stated that the British position is fully supported by France.

    劳埃德冥顽不灵
    坚持要埃及接受国际管制计划
    新华社21日讯　利物浦消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德10月20日在利物浦举行的保守党集会上发表演说，重申英国政府坚持以在安全理事会中被否决的“国际管制”运河计划作为同埃及进行谈判的基础。
    劳埃德说，英法两国在联合国安全理事会上提出的提案是两国所能作出的“和解的极限”。他一方面表示安全理事会通过的“六项原则”是一个“很大的进展”，一方面坚持要埃及首先提出具体建议，而这些建议“必须对运河使用国提供不少于原来的十八国建议所包含的有效的保证”。
    劳埃德说，英国政府愿意同埃及代表谈判，“只要埃及的建议符合英法提交安全理事会的提案中的第二部分”。而这一部分正是为安全理事会所否决的，其中规定要建立对苏伊士运河的“国际管制”制度。
    劳埃德说，不能容许苏伊士运河归一国政府控制，这是英国当局所不能“让步”的“原则”。
    劳埃德还表示，英国的这种立场得到法国的充分支持。
