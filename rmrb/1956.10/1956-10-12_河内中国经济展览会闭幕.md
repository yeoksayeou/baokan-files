Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 11th - The Chinese Economic Construction Achievements Exhibition, which began on September 3rd in Hanoi, closed at 9:00 PM on October 10th. More than 928,000 people visited this exhibition, breaking the record for the number of visitors to any exhibition in Vietnam.

On the evening of the closing day, the audience was still very crowded. When the loudspeakers urged the audience to leave, many people were still gathered around the large table in front of the exhibition hall, writing their thoughts. The last person to write in the guestbook was Nguyen Binh Khang, a teacher at the Central Secondary Normal School of Vietnam. He wrote that the Chinese Exhibition is a microcosm of Vietnam's tomorrow.

After the closing, many people still lingered in front of the brightly lit exhibition hall.

Senior officials from some departments of the Vietnamese government continued to visit the exhibition hall in the days before the closing. Tran Dang Khoa, Minister of Water Conservancy and Construction of the Vietnamese government, visited the exhibition hall seven times. In addition, there were quite a few people who visited more than ten times.

Visitors wrote a total of more than 15,000 enthusiastic messages. Some were written by workers and farmers, and some were written by children and elderly people nearing 100 years old.

The exquisite machinery and light industrial products in the exhibition were particularly attractive to the Vietnamese business community. During the exhibition, hundreds of Vietnamese industrialists and businessmen approached the exhibition's organizing committee to discuss ordering Chinese machinery and raw materials.

The Chinese Economic Construction Achievements Exhibition left a deep impression on the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an article saying that after visiting the Chinese Exhibition Hall, everyone was full of confidence in the future of Vietnam, because they saw the enormous strength of the socialist camp's big family growing day by day; they saw that the road China has taken is the road that Vietnam must take.

    河内中国经济展览会闭幕
    新华社河内11日电　9月3日开始在河内举行的中国经济建设成就展览会已经在10月10日晚上九时闭幕。有九十二万八千多人次参观了这个展览会，打破了越南历次展览会观众人数的纪录。
    在闭幕的当天晚上，观众还是十分拥挤。当扩音器催促观众离馆的时候，还有很多观众围在展览馆前的大桌子旁边写他们的感想。最后在留言簿上题字的是越南中央中等师范学校的教员阮平抗。他写道，中国展览会是越南明天的缩影。
    闭幕以后，还有许多人在灯光辉煌的展览馆门前徘徊。
    越南政府一些部门的高级负责人员在闭幕的前几天，还继续到展览馆参观。越南政府水利和建筑部部长陈登科曾经到展览馆参观了七次。此外，参观过十多次的人并不在少数。
    参观的人一共写下了一万五千多条热情的留言。其中有工人和农民写的，也有儿童和年近百岁的老人写的。
    展览会中的精美机器和轻工业品特别吸引着越南的工商界。在展览期间，有成百名的越南工商业者向展览会的筹备委员会商谈订购中国机器和原料。
    中国经济建设成就展览会在越南人民心目中留下很深的印象。越南“人民报”发表文章说，参观中国展览馆以后，每个人都对越南的前途充满了信心，因为人们看到了社会主义阵营大家庭日益发展的巨大力量；看到了中国所经过的道路就是越南一定要走的道路。
