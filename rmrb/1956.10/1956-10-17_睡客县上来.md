    From Shueike County
    Luo Zijing, a cadre from Guangrao County sent to Yong'an District to conduct Yellow River control work, neither inspected the river's flow after arriving in the district, nor did he engage in in-depth work among the masses. Instead, he spent his days sleeping.
    On the first day, he slept until half past eleven before finally getting up, throwing on his clothes, and dragging his shoes to the kitchen. Without bothering to wash his face, he busied himself with eating some food before returning to his original bed and falling back asleep.
    The next day, he hurriedly got out of bed to eat after the meal bell rang. After the meal, he sat on the edge of the bed, his hands in his pockets, his head drooping, closing his eyes to rest. He persevered in this nodding motion for more than twenty minutes before finally falling sideways onto the bed and snoring sweetly. After four o'clock in the afternoon, he roused himself with great effort, squinted his eyes, went to the street, and gorged himself on snacks, candy, peanuts, roast chicken, buns, and other foods. Then, he seized the time to return to bed and plunge into dreamland.
    The third day, the fourth day… From the time he arrived until now, three months have passed, and he has spent most of his time living in a world of dreams.
    Comrade Xiao Zhang from the district office couldn't resist his curiosity and asked him, "Old Luo, you're doing Yellow River control work, why don't you go to the Yellow River and take a look!"
    "If the Yellow River isn't flooding and there's no imminent danger, what's the point of looking at it?"
    "Doing some work among the masses is better than you sleeping all day; you might develop problems from sleeping like this."
    "I'm from Zhejiang, I don't understand the northern dialect at all, what else am I supposed to do besides sleep…"
    "Does Yellow River control work just mean waiting for the river to breach and then rushing to deal with the emergency? Will someone come teach you the northern dialect in your dreams?"
    "This…".

    睡客县上来
    广饶县派赴永安区进行治黄工作的干部骆子敬，到区后，既不到黄河视察水势，又不深入群众工作，只是整天睡大觉。
    第一天一直睡到十一点半，他才披着衣、拖着鞋，到了厨房，未顾得洗脸，忙着吃了点饭，就又回到原来的床上入梦了。
    第二天吃饭铃响过，他才匆忙离床吃饭。饭后就坐到床沿上，两手装在裤兜里，搭拉着脑袋，闭目养神，前仰后合坚持了二十多分钟，终于又横倒在床上鼾然甜睡起来。下午四点多钟，他强打精神爬将起来，眯缝着眼，到大街上拣着点心、糖果、花生、烧鸡、包子等饱食一顿，又抓紧时间回到床上，闯进梦乡。
    第三天，第四天………从来到现在三个月时间，大部分时间都生活在梦境世界里。
    区公所小张同志禁不住好奇心，问他说：“老骆，你作治黄工作，怎么不到黄河上去看看哪！”
    “黄水不泛滥，没开口危险，看它干吗？”
    “你到群众中作些工作，不比你整天睡觉强；这样怕睡出毛病来。”
    “我是浙江人，死不懂北方话，不睡干什么………”
    “治黄工作是否只是等着开口抢险；梦中是否有人来教会北方话呢？”
    “这……”。　信志
