    Bumper Cotton Harvests in Shaanxi and Anhui
    Xinjiang Production Corps' Cotton Average Yield Per Mu Reaches Approximately 310 Jin of Seed Cotton
    (Our report) Currently, members of agricultural cooperatives in southern Shaanxi and the Guanzhong area are busily picking and drying new cotton. This year, Shaanxi Province has a bumper cotton harvest on 4.8 million mu of land. If no major disasters occur in the future, it is estimated that 2.92 million dan of ginned cotton can be harvested, an increase of more than 1.4 million dan compared to last year, with an average yield of 60 jin of ginned cotton per mu.
    Recently, news of the bumper harvest has spread throughout the cotton-producing areas of Guanzhong. The 530,000 mu of high-yield fields in the Guanzhong area achieved an average yield of 133 jin of ginned cotton per mu. In the high-yield fields of the Gangtie (Steel) and Heping (Peace) agricultural cooperatives in Jingyang County, each mu of cotton will yield nearly 1,000 jin of seed cotton (equivalent to 330 jin of ginned cotton).
    This year, Shaanxi's cotton is not only high in yield but also has long fibers, strong tensile strength, good luster, and low impurity content. The vast majority is graded at medium or above. (Li Qian)
    (Xinhua News Agency) Anhui Province has achieved a bumper harvest on 3.75 million mu of cotton. According to estimates by the province's Department of Agriculture and Department of Agricultural Products Procurement, this year's cotton production will increase by 40% compared to last year's bumper harvest. New cotton is already being marketed in large quantities.
    This year, Anhui Province expanded its cotton planting area by 18% compared to last year. Although some areas suffered from diseases, pests, floods, and typhoons, the agricultural cooperatives actively rescued the crops and strengthened field management, resulting in vigorous cotton growth.
    (Our report) The agricultural production corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Xinjiang Military Region has achieved another bumper harvest on 350,000 mu of cotton planted in southern and northern Xinjiang. According to preliminary estimates from various reclamation areas, the average yield of the 350,000 mu of cotton can reach approximately 310 jin of seed cotton per mu. The 220,000 mu of cotton in the Manas River basin area can reach an average yield of over 330 jin of seed cotton per mu, and the area of cotton fields with a yield of over 400 jin per mu will be greater than last year.
    This year, the cotton planted by the production and construction corps suffered more severe natural disasters than in any previous year. The temperature was very low in the first half of the year, and some cotton was damaged by hail. The dry season in the Manas River basin area lasted until early July. However, thanks to the timely and effective measures taken by the leaders of various reclamation areas, they finally overcame the natural disasters. The Manas River basin area, which was the most severely affected, flexibly adopted comprehensive technical measures to increase soil temperature and promote early cotton maturity. Recently, based on the suggestions made by Soviet agricultural expert Professor Gorelov after inspecting the cotton fields in the Shihezi reclamation area, they used subsoilers to cut off the cotton roots ten days before frost in areas with high groundwater levels or many green bolls, promoting early boll opening and increasing the yield of pre-frost cotton.
    During this busy cotton-picking season, the leading organs of the production and construction corps mobilized all faculty, staff, and students of directly affiliated schools, as well as staff who could be spared from the organs, and more than 48,000 young students who had just arrived in Xinjiang, to support the cotton-picking work in the Manas River area. It is expected that the 350,000 mu of cotton can be basically harvested within more than 40 days.

    陕西、安徽棉花丰收
    新疆生产部队的棉花平均亩产量可达籽棉三一零斤左右
    本报讯　目前，陕西省南部和关中地区的农业社社员们正在紧张地摘采和晾晒新棉。今年陕西省四百八十万亩棉花丰收，如果今后不再发生特大灾害，估计可收皮棉二百九十二万担，比去年可增产一百四十多万担，平均亩产量可以达到六十斤皮棉。
    最近，在关中产棉区，到处传播着丰收的喜讯。关中地区的五十三万亩大面积丰产田，平均亩产量可达到一百三十三斤皮棉。在泾阳县的钢铁、和平等农业社的高额丰产田里，每亩棉花产量将有近一千斤籽棉的收获（合皮棉三百三十斤）。
    今年陕西省的棉花不仅产量高，而且绒长，拉力强，光泽好，含杂量也少，绝大部分品级都在中级以上。　（李茜）
    新华社讯　安徽省的三百七十五万亩棉花获得丰收。据这个省农业厅和农产品采购厅估计，今年全省棉花，要比丰收的去年增产四成。目前，新棉已经大量上市。
    今年安徽省棉花播种面积比去年扩大了18％，部分地区的棉花虽连遭病、虫、涝、台风等灾害，但经农业社积极抢救，加强田间管理，棉花生长仍很旺盛。
    本报讯　中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产部队在南、北疆种植的三十五万亩棉花，今年又获得丰收。根据各垦区最近的初步测算，三十五万亩棉花的平均亩产量可达到籽棉三百一十斤左右。玛纳斯河流域地区的二十二万亩棉花，平均亩产量可达到籽棉三百三十斤以上，单位面积产量在四百斤以上的棉田将多于去年。
    生产建设部队今年种植的棉花，曾经几次遭受比过去任何一年更为厉害的天灾。前半年的气温很低，部分棉花又遭受雹打。玛纳斯河流域地区的枯水期，一直延至7月初。但由于各垦区的领导及时地采取了有效措施，终于战胜了天灾。受灾最严重的玛纳斯河流域地区，灵活地采用了综合技术措施，增加了地温，促使棉花早熟。最近他们又根据苏联农业专家高列洛夫教授到石河子垦区棉田视察后提出的建议，在地下水位较高或青铃较多的地区，用中耕器在下霜前十天内铲断棉根，促使棉花早日吐絮，增产霜前花。
    在这紧张的摘棉季节里，生产建设部队的领导机关，动员了直属各学校的全体教职员、学生和机关里可能抽出的工作人员，以及刚来新疆的青年学生共四万八千余人，到玛纳斯河地区支援摘棉工作。预计在四十多天内，三十五万亩棉花可基本上收摘完毕。
