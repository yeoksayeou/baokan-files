    Improving the Distribution of Academic Journals

    Northeast People's University publishes three regular academic periodicals: "Northeast People's University Journal of Natural Sciences," "Northeast People's University Journal of Humanities," and "Historical Studies Collection." According to the joint regulations of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the Publishing Bureau, these three periodicals are all distributed by the Jilin Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration.

    "Journal of Natural Sciences" has a history of ten months, and currently only has a few hundred subscribers. "Journal of Humanities" has been published for a year, and now has only over a thousand subscribers. "Historical Studies Collection" is newly founded, and only a few hundred copies are currently being sold on consignment. The remaining journals have to be stockpiled.

    However, on the other hand, many units and individuals cannot buy the journals locally and often send letters to us requesting to purchase and read them. People from Beijing and Qingdao have written to reflect that they cannot buy our university's journals locally. It is particularly worth mentioning that many large cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shenyang, and Dalian, all refuse to sell the newly founded "Historical Studies Collection" on consignment. According to regulations, newly founded periodicals (first issue) cannot be subscribed to, only sold on consignment, but they refuse to sell them on consignment.

    Of course, there are many reasons for the small circulation of academic journals, but the fact that local post offices have not seriously done a good job in distribution is probably the main reason.

    To facilitate relevant departments in improving their work, we request: 1. Academic periodicals (whether regular or irregular) should be available for both subscription through the post office and consignment sales through Xinhua Bookstore. Bookstores should place scientific journals on the reading platforms; 2. Post offices and Xinhua Bookstores in major and medium-sized cities should sell journals and other academic magazines on consignment. Refusing to sell them on consignment is not beneficial to academic exchange. Li Zhaoxun

### 改进学报发行工作

    改进学报发行工作
    东北人民大学出版三种定期学术性刊物：“东北人民大学自然科学学报”、“东北人民大学人文科学学报”、“史学集刊”。按邮电部和出版局的联合规定，这三种刊物，都由吉林省邮电管理局发行。
    “自然科学学报”，已有十个月的历史，目前只有几百个订户，“人文科学学报”，创刊已一年，现在的订户仅达一千多，“史学集刊”系新创办，现在只寄售几百份。剩下的学报，只好积压着。
    但是，另一方面，不少单位和个人，在当地买不到学报，常常寄信给我们，要求购阅学报。北京、青岛都有人来信反映在当地买不到我校学报。尤其值得提出的是：有不少大城市，像北京、上海、天津、广州、沈阳、大连等邮局都拒绝寄售新创刊的“史学集刊”。按规定，新创刊的刊物（第一期）不能订阅，只能寄售，而他们又拒绝寄售。
    当然，学报发行量小的原因很多，但，各地邮局没有认真做好发行工作，恐怕应该是主要原因。
    为便于有关部门改进工作，我们要求：1、应该使学术刊物（不管定期不定期）既可以通过邮局订阅，又可以通过新华书店寄售，书店应该把科学期刊摆到阅览台上来；2、各大、中城市的邮局和新华书店均应寄售学报和其他学术杂志，拒绝寄售对学术交流是没有好处的。　李昭恂
