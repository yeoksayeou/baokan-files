Reconnaissance work for river repair projects has been completed in the Xuchang and Anyang special districts and in Anyang and Xinxiang cities. Surveying work has been completed in the Shangqiu special district and the suburban areas of Kaifeng city, and surveying work in the Kaifeng special district has also begun. Construction plans for the Xinyang and Xuchang special districts have been compiled.
    In order to do a good job in construction, construction worker training classes have been held in various places. Training classes for 1,300 students in the Anyang and Xinxiang special districts have already concluded.
    The Xuchang special district is raising grain for 40,000 laborers during construction, and counties such as Anyang and Junxian in the Anyang special district have begun labor planning and the transfer of grain and coal.
    Within Henan Province, apart from the Yellow River's flood not being too large this year, most other rivers experienced exceptionally large floods. Dikes and embankments in some sections were overflowed or even breached by the floods, and some buildings were destroyed. In order to restore the original flood resistance capacity of the rivers, the Henan Provincial Annual Repair Flood Prevention Headquarters decided to vigorously carry out dike and embankment repair projects on the rivers this winter and next spring. These projects are planned to require more than 34 million cubic meters of earthwork.

    修复淮河等河道堤防工程
    新华社讯　河南省准备在淮河、卫河、漳河开始河道堤防修复工程。大批水利工作人员正进行施工前的准备工作。许昌、安阳两专区及安阳、新乡两市对河道修复工程的查勘工作已经结束，商丘专区、开封市郊区已经完成了测量工作，开封专区的测量工作也开始了。信阳和许昌专区的施工计划已经编制出来。
    为了做好施工工作，各地还都举办了施工员训练班。安阳和新乡专区有一千三百名学员的训练班已结束。
    许昌专区正在为施工时四万民工筹集粮食，安阳专区安阳、浚县等县开始了劳力规划和粮食、煤炭的调运工作。
    河南省境内，今年除了黄河的洪水不太大外，其他各河流多发生了特大洪水，有些河段的堤防被洪水漫过甚至冲决，有的建筑物被冲毁。河南省岁修防汛指挥部为了恢复各河道原有的抗洪能力，决定在今冬明春对各河道堤防大力进行修复工程。这些工程，计划需要土方三千四百多万公方。
