Brothers and sisters, workers of Anshan,

    First, please accept the respect of the Republic of Indonesia for you—the workers who are striving to build this factory. (Applause)

    A few months ago, Chairman Mao Zedong and the government of the People's Republic of China invited the President of the Republic of Indonesia and his entourage to visit your country. We immediately accepted this invitation because we wanted to see for ourselves the situation of the People's Republic of China, the most populous country with 600 million people, and its people. (Applause)

    Friends, the Republic of Indonesia and its people have never hesitated in establishing friendly relations with you and your country. In early 1950, after the world recognized the sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia, the Republic of Indonesia immediately recognized the People's Republic of China. (Applause)

    Now, our Brother Gano is here among you. In fact, our Brother Gano used to study engineering and is a technical expert. Therefore, in principle, he should live in factories like you all day long. However, because our people were oppressed and suffered from the scourge of colonialism, Brother Gano gave up his profession. He is now among the people, leading our country to establish friendly relations with you. (Applause)

    Therefore, we are very happy to meet you. You are building your country, and we are also building our country in Indonesia. Let us visit each other, learn from each other, and exchange experiences. We must establish a friendship in Asia to fight against all colonialism, avoid all wars, so as to live in peace and jointly build a happy society for all Asian people.

    Friends, I have finished speaking. (Applause)

    印度尼西亚外交部长阿卜杜加尼的讲话兄弟姊妹们，鞍山的工人们，
    首先，请接受印度尼西亚共和国对你们——努力建设这个工厂的工人们的敬意。（鼓掌）
    几个月以前，毛泽东主席和中华人民共和国政府邀请印度尼西亚共和国总统和他的随行人员访问你们的国家。我们立即接受了这个邀请，因为我们想亲眼看看这个人口最多的、拥有六亿人口的中华人民共和国和她的人民的情况。（鼓掌）
    朋友们，在同你们和你们的国家建立友好关系的问题上，印度尼西亚共和国和她的人民从来就没有犹疑过。1950年初，当全世界承认了印度尼西亚共和国的主权之后，印度尼西亚共和国就立即承认了中华人民共和国。（鼓掌）
    现在，我们的总统加诺兄已经来到你们中间。其实，我们的加诺兄过去是学工程的，是位技术专家。因此，按理说，他应该像你们这样整天生活在工厂里。可是，由于我国人民受到压迫，遭到殖民主义的灾害，所以加诺兄放弃了他所学的那一行，他现在处在人民中间，他领导我国同你们建立友好关系。（鼓掌）
    因此，我们非常愉快能和你们见面。你们正在建设你们的国家，我们也正在印度尼西亚建设我们的国家。让我们互相访问，互相学习，互相交流经验。我们要在亚洲建立起反对一切殖民主义的斗争的友谊，避免一切战争，以便和平相处，共同建设一个全体亚洲人民的幸福社会。
    朋友们，我的话完了。（鼓掌）
