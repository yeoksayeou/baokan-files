Youth and the Jujube Tree
	Yuming

	There is a young man whom I always remember. This young man is Tian Suanliu.

	I don't know Tian Suanliu personally. But his heroic image of daring to fight against bad phenomena, since it was revealed in the China Youth Daily on August 2, seems to have taken root in my mind, becoming increasingly clear.

	Isn't it so, after someone was wrongly evaluated as a first-class labor model using fabricated exaggerations and disguises, Tian Suanliu couldn't stand it and immediately reported it to the higher authorities with indignation. When the leaders didn't listen to his opinions, he continued to report it to the presidium of the model selection conference at that time. For this matter, he suffered a series of blows and retaliations. Some leaders said that he "did not proceed from the overall situation," and that he was "undisciplined and unorganized." He answered with confidence and righteousness:

	"It is the responsibility of every member of the Communist Youth League to fight against bad phenomena." Others said he was "conceited" and threatened to expel him from the League, but he did not succumb and end the struggle. Later, his righteous struggle finally achieved victory with the support of the Party organization.

	I love such youth, and I say such youth are excellent. Because such youth have horns on their heads and thorns on their bodies. With his horns and thorns, he knocked down and pierced through bureaucracy, big labels, rude attitudes, and evil means, one by one. This is a righteous spirit of the youth of our new era.

	However, I don't quite understand why some leaders don't like such horned and thorny youth, but only like youth who are as soft as velvet.

	It is true that horned and thorny youth are difficult and troublesome to deal with, and being difficult and troublesome is not very comfortable. It is true that velvet-like youth are docile and obedient, but being blindly obedient is not necessarily a good thing. For these things, we need to maintain a clear mind. As the old saying goes: "It is most foolish not to carefully observe the right and wrong of things, but to only like others to praise oneself." "It is better to have one person say a straightforward word against one's heart than to have a thousand people say a lot of nice things following one's own heart." These words have profound meaning.

	Of course, no one denies that the cause we are engaged in is open and aboveboard, but no one can say that there is not the slightest shadow on the back of this open and aboveboard. No one denies that the general leaders have a higher level of thinking and see problems more deeply than their subordinates, but no one can say that they are already perfect and beyond reproach. In order to reduce and eliminate the shadows in our work, and to make up for the shortcomings of the leaders, we need to pool our wisdom and broaden our channels for expression.

	Youth, especially horned and thorny youth, are most sensitive to all kinds of new things. They often applaud and welcome the good things first, and they also often raise their hands to oppose the bad things first. Is this kind of clear-cut love and hatred, and uncompromising sensitivity, not better than the bad habit of being unclear about right and wrong and conforming to the world? But some leaders like to work on the edges and thorns of youth, trying to grind them all away, so that they are like smooth stones in the big rivers. What good is this? Speaking of this, I can't help but think of a few lines of poetry, and I want to use these lines of poetry to appeal for the youth. The poem says:

	Outside the window is a jujube tree,
	With a truly red heart within;
	Though there are thorns between the branches,
	The dates that grow are deeply sweet.
Aren't our horned and thorny youth just like such jujube trees? Should we ruthlessly cut them down, or warmly cultivate them?

	I think everyone will make a wise choice.

    青年与枣树
    愚明
    有一位青年，我一直怀念着。这个青年，就是田拴榴。
    田拴榴，我是不认识的。但是他那种敢于向坏现象作斗争的英勇形象，自从8月2日中国青年报上披露以后，好像在我的脑子里扎下了根，越来越鲜明。
    不是吗，有人用虚构夸大和改头换面的方法，错误地评出一等劳动模范以后，田拴榴就看不过眼去，马上愤愤不平地向上级来揭发。领导人不听他的意见，他又继续向当时评选模范大会主席团来揭发。为了这件事，他曾遭到一连串的打击和报复。有的领导人说他“不是从整体出发”，说他“无组织，无纪律”，他理直气壮地回答：
  “向坏现象作斗争是每个青年团员应有的责任。”又有人说他“自高自大”，威胁他要开除他的团籍，他也没有屈服，终止斗争。后来，他的正义斗争，终于在党组织的支持下，得到了胜利。
    我喜爱这样的青年，我说这样的青年是好样的。因为这样的青年头上长着角，身上还有刺。凭着他的角和刺，把一些官僚主义、大帽子、粗暴态度、恶劣手段等等，都一个一个地碰垮了，刺烂了。这是我们新时代青年的一股正气。
    但是，我不大理解，有些领导人为什么不喜爱这样长角的、有刺的青年，只喜爱像丝绒一样软绵绵的青年。
    长角的、有刺的青年，诚然是要碰手、棘手的，碰手、棘手也是不怎么舒服的，然而碰手棘手并不一定都是坏事情。丝绒一样软绵绵的青年，诚然是顺手的，听话的，然而百依百顺也并不一定都是好事情。对于这些，都需要保持清醒的理智。古话说得好：“不细心观察事情的是非，而专门喜欢别人赞美自己，那是再胡涂不过的。”“一千人光顺着自己的心眼说一大堆好听话，不如一个人背着自己的心眼说一句直率话。”这些话有着深刻的含义。
    当然，谁都不否认，我们所干的事业是光明磊落的，但谁也不能说这个光明磊落的背面没有一点点阴影。谁都不否认，一般的领导人，都比他的被领导的同志思想水平高一点，看问题深一点，但谁也不能说自己已经完美无缺，无可非议。为了减少和扫清我们工作中的阴影，为了补足领导人的不足，正需要集思广益，畅开言路。
    青年，特别是长角的、有刺的青年，对于各种新鲜事物是最敏感的。好的，他们往往先来鼓掌欢迎，坏的，他们也往往先来举手反对。这种爱憎分明、丝毫不苟的敏感性，难道不比那种是非不清、与世俯仰的恶习好得多吗？但是有的领导人却喜欢在青年的棱角上和刺上下功夫，想把它一律磨掉磨光，使他们像大江大河里的光滑的石子一样。这有什么好处呢？谈到这里，我不禁想起几句诗，想用这几句诗来替青年呼吁一下。诗曰：
    窗外有枣树，
    内实有赤心；
    枝间虽有刺，
    结枣甜味深。我们的有角和有刺的青年，不正是像这样的枣树吗？对于这样的枣树，是无情地砍伐它呢，还是热诚地培植它呢？
    我想，谁也会作出明智的选择。
