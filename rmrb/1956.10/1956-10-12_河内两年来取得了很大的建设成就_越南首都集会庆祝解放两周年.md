Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 10th: Over ten thousand representatives from all walks of life in Hanoi gathered at the open-air People's Theater this evening to celebrate the second anniversary of the liberation of the Vietnamese capital.

Tran Danh Tuyen, Secretary of the Hanoi Municipal Committee of the Vietnam Labor Party and Vice Chairman of the Hanoi Administrative Committee, reported on the achievements and situation of Hanoi's economic recovery, cultural development, and municipal construction in the two years since its liberation.

In the two years since liberation, Hanoi has built factories and enterprises, and small industry and handicrafts have almost entirely recovered, with some aspects even developing further. Land reform in the suburbs has been completed, and the lives of farmers have improved.

The number of students has increased from 35,000 before liberation to over 80,000 this year. Illiteracy in the urban areas has been basically eliminated. In the past two years, the government has solved the unemployment problem for more than 50,000 people. Sewers have been built, and electric lights and running water have been installed in the areas where the working people live.

Tran Danh Tuyen finally called on the citizens of Hanoi to unite, overcome difficulties, correct shortcomings, and strive to build the capital.

After the meeting, a cultural performance was held. The Hungarian folk music troupe, which recently visited Vietnam, participated in the performance.
