　　The Great Contributions of Arab Culture to Human Culture
　　Ma Jian
　　When we mention the cultures of countries like Egypt, Babylon, Assyria, India, Greece, and Rome, everyone feels familiar with them. However, when we mention Arab culture, people feel somewhat unfamiliar. Now, based on my personal understanding, I will introduce the great contributions of Arab culture to human culture, in order to enhance the understanding of the people of our country towards the people of Arab countries and strengthen friendship and cooperation between us.

　　Before introducing Arab culture, let's briefly discuss the development of the Arab nation. The Arab nation was originally not well-known. They lived on the Arabian Peninsula, almost isolated from the world. When their society was about to disintegrate from the clan system, most people still lived a nomadic life, with a few engaged in agriculture and commerce. Each tribe had its own worshipped idols, and conflicts often occurred between tribes due to clan revenge, resulting in mutual killings and a failure to unite into a nation, leading to oppression and exploitation by foreign tribes. It was not until the early seventh century, when the Arab national hero Muhammad preached Islam, calling on the people of various Arab tribes to stop internal clan disputes, unite to establish an Islamic state, that the Arabs became a unified and powerful nation.

　　After Muhammad's death, his chief disciple inherited his leadership position, known as the "Caliph" (successor). During the period from 632 to 1258 AD, the Arabs established an unprecedented Saracen Empire (the Great Food Country). The territory of this empire stretched from the eastern coast of the Atlantic Ocean in the west to China and India in the east, from the Indian Ocean in the south to the Aral Sea in the north, covering a wider area than the Roman Empire in its heyday.

　　After establishing the empire, the Arabs came into contact with the cultures of Greece, Persia, India, China, and other countries, learned many valuable knowledge, engaged in diligent scientific research, and created a splendid Arab culture, completing the glorious mission of connecting Eastern and Western cultures in the history of world culture.

　　Arabic Language and Literature

　　Arabic, like Chinese, has been passed down in an unbroken line. Arabic has a rich vocabulary and rigorous syntax, as well as various rhetorical forms. Arabic is not only the language of poetry but also the language of science. From the mid-eighth century to the end of the eleventh century, Arabic was once an international scientific language. In that era, anyone who wanted to receive higher education in the West had to learn Arabic. Arabic had even wider uses in politics, commerce, and religion. Currently, Persian, Afghan, Urdu, and Uyghur (the script on the left of the back of our RMB) are all spelled using Arabic letters, and Turkish and Malay, which contain a large number of Arabic vocabulary, were also like this in the past. Because the classics of Islam are in Arabic, there are people who understand Arabic wherever there is Islam. From Iraq to Morocco, the people of all Arab countries, regardless of whether they believe in Islam, are using Arabic.

　　Many countries around the world broadcast in Arabic every day. Arabic is used in various international conferences of the United Nations. Comprehensive universities around the world have Arabic language majors. In short, Arabic was once the most important international language in the Middle Ages, and it is still an important international language. The importance of this language will gradually increase with the international status of Arab countries, which is obvious.

　　Arabic literature is rich and colorful, and writers have left valuable literary heritage for future generations. We can glimpse the social situation of the time from those works. The most widely spread Arabic literature is the story of "One Thousand and One Nights." This great story has been translated into the languages of various countries around the world. The Chinese abridged translation is called "Arabian Nights."

　　Arabic poetry and legends have had a significant impact on European literature. From Boccaccio's "Decameron," Shakespeare's play "All's Well That Ends Well," and Lessing's dramatic poem "Nathan the Wise," Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales" to Longfellow's "Tales from a Wayside Inn," Dante's Divine Comedy, Cervantes' Don Quixote and other famous works, in terms of subject matter, writing style, and style, are more or less directly or indirectly related to Arabic literature.

　　Arabic Mathematics

　　The greatest contribution of the Arabs to mathematics is the spread of Arabic numerals and the use of the "0" symbol. The names of zero in European languages, such as cipher, cypher, zero, etc., are all transliterations of the Arabic word sifr (empty). The Arabs had already begun using the zero symbol in the mid-eighth century, and Europeans only learned Arabic numerals and the method of filling empty spaces with the zero symbol from the Arabs in the twelfth century. They called this method the decimal notation. It was a major advancement in mathematics for Europeans to use Arabic numerals instead of Roman numerals.

　　The second achievement of the Arabs in mathematics is the invention of algebra. Indian and Greek mathematics only had the preliminary knowledge of algebra. Al-Khwarizmi (780-850) developed that knowledge into an independent science. The name of algebra is a variant of the Arabic word al-gabr, which is also an ironclad proof.

　　The influence of Al-Khwarizmi's works on the thinking of medieval mathematicians is unmatched by any mathematician. His algebra was translated into Latin in the twelfth century and adopted as the main mathematics textbook in European universities, used until the sixteenth century. Arabic algebra and the name of algebra were introduced to Europe through this famous work.

　　Abu al-Wafa (939-998) invented a method of calculating sine tables that could make the sine of half a degree correct to nine decimal places. He used tangents and calculated a tangent table. He invented secants and cosecants for studying the shadow triangles of sundials. He invented this formula for the increase of angles: Sin(a+b)=sin a Cos b+Sin b Cos aR

　　Although this formula had been invented long ago, Europeans did not know it, and Copernicus seemed not to know it either. Copernicus's students worked very hard to invent this theorem. However, the formula he listed was not as simple and clear as this formula. Abu al-Wafa studied the method of finding parabolas and paraboloids. He used geometric methods to solve X4=a and X4+aX3=b, and solved cubic equations by intersecting conic sections. This is the greatest achievement of the Arabs in algebra.

　　The contribution of the Egyptian scientist Ibn Yunus (950-1008) to trigonometry is also very valuable. He solved many difficult problems in spherical astronomy by using orthographic projection. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201-1274) first painstakingly developed trigonometry, making it independent of astronomy and becoming an independent science. His work is "Treatise on the Quadrilateral." This is a first-class and very complete spherical trigonometry. If this book had been known to the world earlier, then European scholars in the fifteenth century would have had no room for research in trigonometry and could have saved a lot of effort (see Bibliotheca Mathematica (2), 7, 1893, p.6).

　　Arabs had many significant contributions to mathematics. They used geometric constructions to solve cubic equations and developed algebra into a precise science, making important developments. They laid the foundation for analytic geometry. They invented plane and spherical trigonometry. This is an indisputable fact, because strictly speaking, the ancient Greeks did not know these two sciences.

　　All important Greek mathematical books were translated into European languages from Arabic. Gerard of Cremona translated more than seventy kinds of Ptolemy's Almagest and other famous works from 1175 onwards. None of the oldest European trigonometric writers, of whom Bravardin and the British are proud, did not use Arabic trigonometry as a blueprint. The Indians introduced sines, versines, and cosines to Europe, while the Arabs introduced tangents, cotangents, secants, and cosecants to Europe.

　　Arabic Astronomy

　　The Arabs first learned the Brahma-Sphuta-Siddhanta of the Indian astronomer Brahmagupta and the Almagest of the Greek astronomer Ptolemy. After hundreds of years of observation and research, they made great contributions to astronomy.

　　The Arabs established observatories in cities such as Baghdad, Damascus, Cairo, Fez, Toledo, Cordoba, and Seville. They created the latest and most precise instruments in the Middle Ages, which were adopted by European astronomers until the time of Tycho Brahe (1546-1601).

　　Arab astronomers emphasized practical measurement rather than calculation. Day and night observation had become a daily routine. In addition to the practical measurement of important astronomical phenomena, they also paid attention to the positions of various stars before and after the phases of solar and lunar eclipses, and made detailed records afterward in order to calculate the dates of future recurrences.

　　Arab astronomers measured the length of one degree of meridian to be 66 2/3 miles through practical measurement. This is a very precise result, with very little difference from the actual angular distance. From this, they created a very subtle geodesic method, which is to assume that the earth is spherical, and then practically measure the length of one degree of meridian, and calculate the volume and circumference of the earth based on this. This was something that Europeans at the time had never heard of, because they believed in the theory of a round sky and a square earth.

　　The Baghdad Observatory continued to observe for seven hundred years (750-1450). The astronomers at this observatory correctly calculated the equitation and the evection based on practical measurement. Around 870 AD, the three sons of Musa of Baghdad: Muhammad, Ahmad, and Hassan, had many novel discoveries, such as the average movement of the sun and other celestial bodies. They also measured the volume of the earth, the obliquity of the ecliptic, the precession, and the changes in the lunar longitude.

　　The astronomer al-Battani (died 929) was the earliest in the tenth century. He was a diligent and intelligent observer. After forty-one years of observation, he achieved brilliant achievements and wrote a star catalog. His most famous achievement was the measurement of the movement of the earth's perihelion, later called the highest line, about one degree every seventy years. He measured the year. His calculated precession was fifty-five seconds. He applied sines and tangents to astronomical calculations. Most of the important items in Arabic astronomy were created by al-Battani. For hundreds of years, Europeans used his works as the basis of astronomy. Laplace praised al-Battani's astrology and cited al-Battani's practical measurement in his book "World System" to confirm the reduction of the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit. Copernicus often quoted al-Battani's practical measurement in his book "On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres." The famous astronomer Lalande said: "al-Battani is one of the twenty famous astronomers in the world."

　　Abu al-Wafa was the most famous astronomer in the latter half of the tenth century. He applied secants and tangents in trigonometry and astronomical observations. He discovered that the center difference and aberration of the moon not only occur in new and full moons and upper and lower quarters, but also have expansion and contraction between quarters, called equitation. It is a pity that this brilliant discovery is often mistaken for Tycho Brahe's achievement six hundred years later. The reputation of the Egyptian astronomer Ibn Yunus (950-1008) is second only to al-Battani. He continued to observe at the Cairo Observatory for thirty-one years, and then formulated the Hakemite Calendar based on the results of practical measurement, which was used for more than two hundred years as a model. He practically measured solar eclipses in 977 and 978 and made the first scientific record, thereby determining the lunar acceleration.

　　Arab astronomers recorded all the stars in their sky and added Arabic names to the higher-ranking celestial bodies. There are more than three hundred proper nouns for stars in European languages. Except for a few Greek and Latin names, most are Arabic names. The names of the zodiac signs still use Arabic names in modern European languages.

　　Arabic Geography

　　The contribution of the Arabs to geography far exceeded Ptolemy. The longitudes and latitudes of many cities measured by Ptolemy were not completely accurate, often with errors of several degrees or even more than ten degrees. Although the Arabs did not have marine chronometers and astronomical almanacs, the longitudes and latitudes they measured only had errors of a few minutes.

　　The business trips of Arab merchants in Asia, Africa, and Europe increased the geographical knowledge of the Arabs. During the Tang and Song dynasties, the footprints of Arab merchants had reached Jiaozhou, Guangzhou, Quanzhou, Hangzhou, Yangzhou, the northern Volga River to the Baltic Sea, and the southern regions south of the equator in Africa. During the Middle Ages, the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the China Sea were places frequently sailed by Arabs. In that era, the trade between the East and the West was completely controlled by the Arabs. The records of Arab merchants in Chinese history books fully illustrate the commercial activities of the Arabs in China. Arab geographers at that time already knew that there were Korea and Japan to the east of China. The "Sila Islands" (Sila) referred to by the Arabs was the "Silla" (Korea) during the Tang Dynasty, and what they called "al-Wakwak" was "Wa" (Japan).

　　Arab geographers and travelers traveled far and wide for investigation and research, carefully observed, and made relatively correct reports. Many famous mathematicians and astronomers promoted the connection between astronomy and geography and strengthened the scientific research of geography. In the ninth century, the Arab merchant Suleiman sailed from the port of Siraf in the Persian Gulf to China. After returning home, he wrote a travelogue of China. In 880, Abu Zayd supplemented the materials and completed this travelogue. Before "The Travels of Marco Polo" was published, "Suleiman's Travel to the East" was the most important work about the Far East.

　　Al-Masudi was an outstanding historian and geographer. Born in Baghdad, he traveled to India, Ceylon, Malaya, China, Persia, Central Asia, East Africa, Syria, and Egypt. His "The Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems" is comprehensive. In addition to ancient Arab history, it also involves the history, geography, customs, and institutions of Asian countries, Greece, and Rome. The records about China are not found in other works. Al-Biruni (973-1048) was proficient in history, mathematics, medicine, and astronomy. He wrote the book "India" in 1031, which clearly records the customs, habits, science, and philosophy of India. He closely linked geography with astronomy and mathematics and greatly improved the precision of geographical mapping. He was the first person in the Middle Ages to make accurate measurements of the longitude and latitude of the earth. Al-Idrisi (1099-1154) was the most outstanding geographer in the Middle Ages. He made a globe out of silver for King Roger II of Sicily, engraved the main climate zones on the globe, and wrote a world geography. In the thirteenth century, the Moroccan astronomer and geographer Abu al-Hasan determined the longitudes and latitudes of forty-one cities in North Africa and corrected the errors on Ptolemy's map based on this. Yaqut wrote a large dictionary of place names in 1227, in four volumes. Whenever a place was mentioned, he talked about the historical evolution and famous people of that place, thus becoming an important library of history, geography, science, and literature. The Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta (1304-1377) had footprints in Beijing. He traveled 12,000 kilometers in Asia, Europe, and Africa for twenty-five years, more than Marco Polo had been to.

　　Arabic writings on geography are extremely important. For hundreds of years, Europeans used some Arabic geography books as the main sources for studying geography. For example, Al-Idrisi's works were translated into Latin and became geography textbooks in European universities. Europeans used this book as the authority on geography for three hundred years. This great work summarizes the records of predecessors, plus the author's personal experience and the reports of investigators. The book is accompanied by precise maps, including the source of the Nile and the lakes in the equatorial region, which were only discovered by Europeans in the past hundred years. It can be seen that the geographical knowledge of the Arabs was accurate and rich.

　　The Portuguese Gama sailed to the Malabar coast with the help of Arab navigators and Arab nautical charts. Arab astronomers and geographers believed that the earth was spherical, and the earth was in the universe just like the yolk was in the center of the egg. Influenced by this theory, Columbus believed that sailing westward could circle the earth and reach the rich China and India. It can be seen that the contribution of Arabic geography to modern geography is so great!

　　Arabic Medicine

　　Although the achievements of the Arabs in medicine were not as good as geography, they were particularly famous in the Middle Ages and the early modern period. Their medical knowledge mainly came from the writings of the Greeks. They also paid attention to absorbing the medicine of the Persians and Indians. However, Arab doctors had many new inventions, which increased the pure scientific tendency lacking in ancient times. Their treatments were richer than those of the ancients. Surgeons already knew about disinfection and knew how to use anesthetics to make patients sleep peacefully to avoid pain. Hundreds of years ago, they could almost treat typhoid fever, cholera, plague, cataracts, bleeding and other symptoms in modern ways.

　　Arab physicians made great contributions to medicinal properties. They introduced the use of alcohol, camphor, sal ammoniac, rhubarb and other drugs. They were good at chemistry, so they could prepare new chemical prescriptions and formulate many compounds according to the prescription for application. The names and methods of pharmacy prescriptions were taught by them. Our current outline of pharmaceutical science, except for those supplemented by new chemistry, is really created by them. European pharmacists still use many terms in Arabic pharmaceutical science, such as Elixir, Julep, Syrup, sugar, Camphor, Soda are all Arabic words.

　　Al-Razi (died 932) was the greatest clinician of the entire Middle Ages. He invented the suture method in surgery, the mental therapy for certain internal diseases, the first important treatment for smallpox. He made many new contributions to obstetrics and gynecology, and discussed ophthalmic surgery, suggesting chemistry to serve medicine. His "Comprehensive Book of Medicine" and other works were translated into Latin and were adopted as textbooks in various universities until the nineteenth century.

　　Ibn Sina (Avicenna) wrote a 10,000-word medical encyclopedia, called the "Canon of Medicine," which is comprehensive and integrates the achievements of ancient medicine. He first correctly described smallpox and distinguished measles from smallpox. He distinguished mediastinitis from pleurisy, recognized the contagiousness of pulmonary tuberculosis, and recognized that water and soil are the medium of infectious diseases. He paid special attention to the study of skin diseases, venereal diseases, melancholia and nervous diseases. This classic work was translated into Latin in the twelfth century and became the most important document. European universities adopted it as a textbook. It was still published everywhere until the second half of the seventeenth century and was welcomed everywhere.

　　During the Middle Ages, the capitals and major cities of Arab countries had a total of thirty-four hospitals. Almost all universities had affiliated hospitals, providing free treatment for faculty, staff, and students. The establishment of mental hospitals was also very common. At that time, people all over the world did not know about public health, and the Arabs already had such a comprehensive system. In the early tenth century, Baghdad alone had 860 doctors who passed the examination and obtained business licenses. In addition, there were many imperial physicians and famous doctors who were exempted from the examination, so there were no less than a thousand doctors in Baghdad at the same time. The hospital founded by the Arabs in Salerno, Italy, was the first hospital in Europe.

　　Arabic Physics and Chemistry

　　The most contribution of the Arabs to physics was Ibn al-Haytham (965-1039). Euclid invented the law that "the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection." Ibn al-Haytham's supplement was: "The angle of incidence and the angle of reflection are always on the same plane." He studied spherical mirrors, parabolic mirrors, prisms, and even further studied twilight. He first explained the structure of the human eye and explained that the light from the object is reflected into the human eye to produce vision. He corrected the mistakes of Greek scientists, who believed that light was emitted from the eyes.

　　His works include Optical Book, Treatise on Twilight, Treatise on Shadows, Treatise on Burning Mirrors, and Principles of Measurement. The first and second types have long been translated into Latin, and the last three types were translated into German in 1907. The terms we use such as retina, cornea, and vitreous humor are all translated from his optical book. His works helped Roger Bacon and Witelo establish scientific optics in the West. Modern optics is based on his theories, so he is the ancestor of optics.

　　The Arabs invented the theorem for finding the specific gravity of solids and liquids, and produced extremely precise specific gravity tables.

　　Prince Khalid of the Umayyad Dynasty (died 704) first translated Greek and Egyptian alchemy and studied it personally. Egypt was the source of Western alchemy, so after the Arabs acquired Egyptian alchemy, they added the Arabic article al to the Egyptian country name and called alchemy al-kimiya, which later became Latin alchimia, and then English alchemy. Also, the English call alchemists alchemist, and later removed the Arabic article, and it became the name of chemists, and from this came the name of chemistry. Many chemical terms are still used in Arabic, such as alcohol, alizarin, alkali, etc. It can be seen that the development of ancient alchemy into modern industrial chemistry should be attributed to the Arabs.

　　Jabir (702-765 AD), who was the most famous in chemistry in the eighth century, was the founder of the phlogiston theory. His authority dominated the European chemical industry for nearly a thousand years. The British scientist Roger Bacon called him a "spiritual philosopher" in the thirteenth century.

　　We can see from Jabir's writings that Arab chemistry was progressing through experiments. They made alum, vitriol, sal ammoniac, borax, cinnabar, pearl ash, alcohol, tartaric acid, corrosive sublimate, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, silver nitrate, aqua regia, sodium carbonate, and obtained caustic potash from distiller's grains, caustic soda from seaweed, and mercuric chloride from mercury. Chemical methods such as distillation, clarification, crystallization, sublimation, and calcination were all familiar and commonly used by them. The famous physician and chemist Al-Razi applied chemical knowledge to medical practice. His book "Secrets" was translated into Latin and was used as a treasure house of chemical knowledge, which was used until the fourteenth century.

　　Conclusion

　　The Arabs have made the following three contributions to human culture:

　　(1) They preserved the ancient Greek culture, and supplemented, revised, and promoted it based on their diligent long-term labor. The Arabs were studious and thoughtful. They were willing to learn everything useful, and were good at organization, using logical methods to organize various disciplines in an orderly manner. Their specialty is to classify and list items. Their promotion and contribution to academic development alone is enough to explain this, not to mention their great achievements in continuing the past and opening up the future for the world's science.

　　(2) Arab scientists have a pragmatic spirit. They base their knowledge on experience and practice. The theory of each subject must be based on experience before they are willing to accept it. Their method of learning is: experiment and observe to gain knowledge; the European method, until the tenth century, was still: read books thoroughly, remember the teacher's words firmly, and create learning. After Roger Bacon was influenced by the Arabs, he used experimentation and observation as a method of learning, replacing strict adherence to teachers and adherence to books, and European academic research was liberated.

　　(3) They introduced China's major inventions such as papermaking, printing, compass, and gunpowder, as well as India's sugar, rice, and cotton to Europe, promoted the development of world culture, and enriched the lives of the people of European countries.

　　Now the people of Arab countries have awakened. They are striving to control their own destiny, inherit the glorious cultural traditions of their ancestors, and make great contributions to human culture.

　　阿拉伯文化对于人类文化的伟大贡献
　　马坚
    提起埃及、巴比伦、亚述、印度、希腊、罗马等国的文化来，大家都觉得很熟悉，提起阿拉伯文化来，大家就觉得有些生疏，现根据个人的认识来介绍一下阿拉伯文化对于人类文化的伟大贡献，以增进我国人民对阿拉伯各国人民的认识，加强彼此间的友谊和合作。
    在介绍阿拉伯文化之前，先简单说一下阿拉伯民族的发展。阿拉伯民族原来是不出名的，他们居住在阿拉伯半岛上，几乎与世隔绝，他们的社会在氏族制快要解体时，大部分人还过着游牧的生活，少数人从事于农业和商业。各部落都有自己所崇拜的物神，各部落之间往往因氏族复仇而不断发生冲突，互相残杀，不能团结成一个民族，以致遭受外族的压迫和剥削。直到七世纪初叶，阿拉伯的民族英雄穆罕默德宣传伊斯兰教，号召阿拉伯各部落的人民，停止氏族间的内争，团结起来建立伊斯兰教国家，阿拉伯人才变成一个统一的、强大的民族。
    穆罕默德去世之后，由他的大弟子继承他的领导地位，世称“哈里发”（继位者）。在公元632年到1258年的期间，阿拉伯人建立了一个旷古未有的萨拉森帝国（大食国），这个帝国的版图，西自大西洋东岸，东至中国和印度，南自印度洋，北至阿拉海，幅员比强盛时代的罗马帝国还要辽阔。
    阿拉伯人在建立帝国后，与希腊、波斯、印度、中国等国的文化接触，学习了许多宝贵的知识，进行了辛勤的科学研究，创造出灿烂辉煌的阿拉伯文化，在世界文化史上完成了沟通东西文化的光荣使命。
    阿拉伯的语言和文学
    阿拉伯文像汉文一样一脉相传，从未中断。阿拉伯文有丰富的词汇和严密的句法，并且有多种多样的修辞形式。阿拉伯文不仅是诗歌的文字，而且是科学的文字。自八世纪中叶到十一世纪末叶，阿拉伯文曾经是国际性的科学语文，在那个时代，凡是要想受高等教育的西方人都必须学习阿拉伯语文。阿拉伯语文在政治、商业和宗教上用途更广。现在，波斯文、阿富汗文、乌尔杜文、维吾尔文（我国人民币背面左边的文字）都是用阿拉伯字母拼写，而且包含大量阿拉伯词汇的土耳其文和马来文在过去也是这样的。由于伊斯兰教的经典是阿拉伯文的，所以凡有伊斯兰教的地方就有人懂得阿拉伯文。自伊拉克到摩洛哥，所有阿拉伯国家的人民，无论他们信不信仰伊斯兰教，都在使用阿拉伯语文。
    世界上许多国家每天都在用阿拉伯语进行广播。在联合国各种国际会议中都使用阿拉伯语文。世界各国的综合性大学里都有阿拉伯语文专业。总之，阿拉伯语文在中古时期曾经是最重要的国际语文，到现在仍旧是一种重要的国际语文，这种语文的重要性，将随着阿拉伯各国的国际地位而逐渐提高，这是显而易见的。
    阿拉伯文学是丰富多采的，文学家们给后代遗留下来宝贵的文学遗产，我们从那些著作里可以窥见当时的社会情况。阿拉伯文学传布最广的是“一千零一夜”的故事，这部伟大的故事已译成世界各国的文字，汉文节译本叫做“天方夜谭”。
    阿拉伯的诗歌和传奇对于欧洲文学曾发生过重大的影响。自薄伽丘的“十日谈”，莎士比亚的戏剧“看效果”和勒新的剧诗“哲人拿坦”，乔叟的“坎特布里故事”到郎斐罗的“路边旅店的故事”，但丁的神曲，塞万提斯的堂·吉呵德等名著在取材、写法和风格上，多多少少都与阿拉伯文学有直接的或者间接的关系。
    阿拉伯的数学
    阿拉伯人对于数学的最大贡献是传播阿拉伯数字和用“0”字记号。欧洲文字里零号的名称cipher，cypher，zero等，都是阿拉伯字sifr（空虚）一音之转。阿拉伯人在八世纪中叶已开始运用零号，欧洲人到十二世纪时候才跟阿拉伯人学到阿拉伯数字和以零号补空位的方法，他们把这种方法叫做十进位记数法。欧洲人用阿拉伯数字代替罗马数字，是数学上的一大进步。
    阿拉伯人在数学上的第二功绩是发明代数学。印度和希腊的数学里只有代数学的初步知识，花剌子密（780—850）把那些知识发展成一门独立的科学。代数学的名称algebra是阿拉伯字al—gabr的变形，也是一个铁证。
    花剌子密的著作对于中世纪数学家思想上的影响是任何数学家都比不上的。他的代数学在十二世纪时译成拉丁文后，被采用做欧洲各大学主要的数学教本，沿用到十六世纪。阿拉伯的代数学和代数学的名称就是由这本名著传入欧洲的。
    艾卜勒·外发（939—998）曾发明一种计算正弦表的方法，能使半度的正弦有九位小数的正确。他曾应用正切，并且计算出一个正切表来。他为研究日圭的阴影三角而发明正割和余割。他为角的增加而发明这个公式：Sin（a＋b）＝sin　a　Cos　b＋Sin　b　Cos　aR
    这个公式虽然早已发明，但是，欧洲人并不知道，哥白尼似乎也不知道。哥白尼的学生费了很
  大劲才发明这个定理。但是他所列的公式还不如这个公式简单明了。艾卜勒·外发曾研究抛物线和抛物线体的求法。他曾用几何法解X4＝a和X4＋aX3＝b，以圆锥曲线的交割解三次方程式。这是阿拉伯人在代数学上最大的功绩。
    埃及的科学家伊本·优努斯（950－1008）对于三角学的贡献也很有价值。他曾借正射影而解决了球面天文学上的许多难题。奈绥伦丁（1201—1274）首先惨淡经营三角学，使其脱离天文学，而成为一门独立的科学。他的创作是“四边论”。这是一本第一流的、十分完善的球面三角学。假若这本书早为世人所认识，那末，十五世纪的欧洲学者在三角学中就没有研究的余地，也可以节省很多劳力了（参看BibliothecaMathematica（2），7，1893，p．6）。
    阿拉伯人对于数学曾有过许多重大的贡献。他们曾用几何作图解三次方程式，曾使代数学成为一种精密的科学，而且加以重要的发展。他们曾奠定解析几何的基础。他们发明平面三角学和球面三角学。这是无可争论的事实，因为严格地说起来，古代希腊人并不知道这两门科学。
    一切重要的希腊数学书都是从阿拉伯文译成欧洲文字的。格里摩拿地方的机拉得自1175年起译多禄某天文集和其他名著七十多种。布拉瓦典和英国人引以自豪的、欧洲最古的几位三角学著作家，没有一个不是用阿拉伯人的三角学做蓝本的。印度人输入欧洲的是正弦、正矢和余弦，阿拉伯人输入欧洲的却是正切、余切、正割和余割。
    阿拉伯的天文学
    阿拉伯人首先学习印度天文学家婆罗门笈多的婆罗门正宗（Brahma—Sphuta—Sidhannta）和希腊天文学家多禄某的天文集（Almagest）。经过好几百年的观测和研究，他们在天文学上作出了伟大的贡献。
    阿拉伯人曾经在巴格达、大马士革、开罗、法斯、托勒多、哥尔多巴、塞维勒等城市建立天文台，他们曾创造了中世纪最新的精密的仪器，为欧洲天文学家所采用，直到第谷时代（1546—1601）。
    阿拉伯的天文学家不重推算而重实测，昼夜测候已成日常工作，除实测重要的天象外，还注意日月食亏复前后各恒星的位置，事后加以详细的记录，以便推算将来复见的日期。
    阿拉伯的天文学家从事实测，测得子午线一度之长为662／3米里，这是非常精密的结果，比真实的距度相差很少。他们从此创立了一种极微妙的测地法，就是假定大地为球形，然后实测子午线一度之长，据此而推算地球的体积及其圆周。这是当时的欧洲人从来没有听见过的新鲜事，因为他们相信天圆地方之说。
    巴格达的天文台曾继续测候七百年（750—1450），这座天文台的天文学家根据实测而正确地算出二均差和二分差。约当公元870年，巴格达人穆萨的三个儿子：穆罕默德和艾哈迈德和哈桑，曾有许多新奇的发现，如太阳和其他天体的平均运动。他们还测定地球的体积、黄道斜角、岁差、太阴纵距的变迁。
    十世纪的天文学家以白塔尼（929年死）为最早，他是一位勤劳精明的观测家，经过四十一年的观测，获得了辉煌的成就，著成恒星表。他最著名的功绩是测定地球远日点的运动，后代称为最高行，约七十年行一度。他曾测定岁实。他所考定的岁差是五十五秒。他曾把正弦和正切应用到天文学上的计算。阿拉伯天文学中重要的条目，大半是白塔尼的创作。欧洲人在好几百年内曾以他的著作为天文学的基础。拉普拉斯曾赞扬白塔尼的星学，而且在自己的著作“世界体系”一书中引白塔尼的实测以证实地球轨道偏心差的减少。哥白尼著“天体运行”一书，常常引证白塔尼的实测。著名的天文学家拉朗德说：“白塔尼是全世界著名的二十位天文学家之一。”
    艾卜勒·外发是十世纪后半期最著名的天文家，他在三角学和天文观测中应用正割和正切。他曾发现太阴的中心差和出差不仅在朔望和上下弦，即在弦望之间也有盈缩之行，称为二均差。这个辉煌的发现往往被人误认为六百年后第谷的功绩，这是一件憾事。埃及的天文学家伊本·优努斯（950—1008）的声望仅次于白塔尼。他在开罗天文台继续观测三十一年，然后根据实测的结果而制定哈克慕历表，沿用二百多年，奉为典范。他在977年和978年实测日食，而首次加以科学的记载，从此决定太阴的加速度。
    阿拉伯的天文学家曾记录他们的天空的一切星宿，而以阿拉伯名称加于等级较高的星体，星宿的专有名词，在欧洲文字中有三百多个，除少数希腊的和拉丁的名称外，大部分是阿拉伯名称。黄道十二宫的名称，在现代的欧洲文字中，仍沿用阿拉伯文的名称。
    阿拉伯的地理学
    阿拉伯人对于地理学的贡献，远远超过了多禄某。多禄某所测定的许多城市的经纬度，并不完全正确，往往有几度乃至十几度的差错。阿拉伯人尽管没有航海时计和天文年历，但他们所测定的经纬度只有几分的差错。
    阿拉伯商人在亚、非、欧三洲上的商务旅行，增加了阿拉伯人的地理知识。唐宋时代，阿拉伯商人的足迹已到交州、广州、泉州、杭州、扬州，北方沿伏尔加河到达波罗的海，南方到非洲赤道以南地区。在中世纪时期，地中海、印度洋、中国海是阿拉伯人经常航行的地方。在那个时代，东方和西方的贸易完全操纵在阿拉伯人的手里。我国历史书中关于大食商人的记载也充分说明了阿拉伯人在中国的商业活动。阿拉伯地理学家那时已经知道中国的东面有朝鲜和日本，阿拉伯人所谓的“西拉诸岛”（Sila）就是唐朝时候的“新罗”（朝鲜），他们所谓“外克瓦克”（al—Wakwak）就是“倭国”（日本）。
    阿拉伯地理学家和旅行家为了调查研究而远游四方，细心观察，而且作出了比较正确的报告。许多著名的数学家和天文学家促进了天文学和地理学的联系，加强了地理学的科学研究。九世纪时候，阿拉伯商人苏莱曼从波斯湾的西拉夫港航海到中国。归国后写中国纪行。880年，艾卜·宰德曾补充材料完成了这本游记。“马可波罗行纪”出世以前，“苏莱曼东游记”是关于远东的最重要的著作。
    麦斯欧迭是一个杰出的历史学家和地理学家，生于巴格达，曾游历印度、锡兰、马来亚、中国、波斯、中央亚细亚、东非、叙利亚、埃及，他所著的“黄金草原”，包罗宏富，除阿拉伯古代史外，还涉及亚洲各国和希腊、罗马的历史、地理、风俗习惯、典章制度，关于中国的记载是别的著作所没有的。白鲁尼（973—1048）精通史学、数学、医学、天文学，1031年写成“印度志”一书，对于印度的风俗、习惯、科学、哲学记载得非常明确。他使地理学与天文学和数学密切联系起来，而且大大地改善了地理测绘的精密度。他是在中世纪时期首先作出关于地球经纬度的精确测量的人。易德里西（1099—1154）是中世纪最优秀的地理学家，曾为西西里国王罗吉尔第二用白银制成一个地球仪，在球面上刻出主要的气候地带，并且著有世界地理志。十三世纪时候，摩洛哥的天文学家兼地理学家艾卜勒·哈桑确定了北非四十一个城市的经纬度，据此而修正多禄某地图上的错误。雅古特在公元1227年著成地名大辞典四大册，每提及一个地方，就讲到那个地方的历史沿革和历代名人，因此成为一部历史、地理、科学、文学的重要文库。摩洛哥的旅行家伊本·白图泰（1304—1377）的足迹曾到北京，二十五年中在亚、欧、非三洲上游历了一万二千公里，比马可波罗到过的地方还要多些。
    阿拉伯人关于地理学的著作是极其重要的，在好几百年内，欧洲人把某些阿拉伯地理学书当做研究地理学的主要资料。例如易德里西的著作译成拉丁文后成为欧洲各大学的地理教材，欧洲人在三百年中以此书为地理学的权威。这部伟大的著作总结了前人的记载，加上著者亲身的见闻和调查研究者的报告，书中附有精密的地图，这些地图包括尼罗河的发源地和赤道地区的湖泊，那是欧洲人在近百年内才发现的。由此可见，阿拉伯人的地理知识是正确而且丰富的。
    葡萄牙人伽马由于阿拉伯领航员和阿拉伯航海地图的帮助，才航行到马拉巴海岸。阿拉伯的天文学家和地理学家都认为大地是球形的，地球在宇宙间正如蛋黄在蛋的中央一样。哥伦布受到这种学说的影响，因而相信向西航行可以绕地球一周，而达到富庶的中国和印度。由此可见，阿拉伯地理学对于现代地理学的贡献是多末伟大！
    阿拉伯的医学
    阿拉伯人在医学上的成就虽然不如地理学，但他们在中古时期和现代初期是特别有名的。他们的医学知识主要是导源于希腊人的著作。他们也注意吸取波斯人和印度人的医学。但阿拉伯的医生曾有许多新发明，增加了古代所缺乏的纯正科学的倾向。他们的治疗法比古人更丰富。外科医生已知道消毒，知道用麻醉药使病人安眠，以免痛苦。在好几百年前，他们差不多就能用现代的方法治疗伤寒、霍乱、瘟疫、白内障、出血等症候。
    阿拉伯的医学家对于药性的贡献很大，他们曾介绍酒精、樟脑、硇精、大黄等药品的用法。他们擅长化学，故能配制新的化学药方，且能依方配制许多化合品，以供应用。药局方的名称和制法都是他们传授的。我们现在的制药学大纲，除由新化学所增补者外，实在是他们所创作的。欧洲的药剂师到现在还使用着阿拉伯制药学上的许多术语，如Elixir（甘芳醇）、Julep（甜药水）、Syrup（糖浆）、sugar（糖）、Camphor（樟脑）、Soda（苏打）都是阿拉伯字。
    拉齐（932年死）是整个中世纪最伟大的临床医师。他曾发明外科上的串线法，对于某些内科病的精神疗法，天花病的第一个重要的治疗法，他对于妇产科有很多新的贡献，并且讨论眼科手术，建议化学为医学服务。他所著的“医学集成”及其他著作译成拉丁文后，直到十九世纪还被采用作各大学的教本。
    伊本·西那（阿维森纳）曾著万言的医学百科全书，称为“医典”，包罗宏富，集古代医药之大成。他首先正确地记述天花，而区别麻疹和天花。他曾区别纵膈炎和肋膜炎，承认肺结核的传染性，并且承认水和土壤是传染病的媒介。他特别注重皮肤病、性病、想思病和神经病的研究。十二世纪时这部经典著作译成拉丁文，成为最重要的文献，欧洲各大学采用做教本，直到十七世纪后半期还在各地出版，到处受人欢迎。
    中世纪时代，阿拉伯国家的首都和各大城市共有医院三十四所。各大学差不多都有附设医院，供教职员工和学生免费治疗。疯人医院的设立也很普遍。当时全世界的人都不知道公共卫生，而阿拉伯人已有这样周密的制度了。十世纪初叶，仅仅巴格达已有八百六十个医生考试及格，领到营业执照。此外，还有许多御医和名医是免考的，故巴格达的医生在同一时候不下千人。阿拉伯人在意大利萨勒诺城创办的医院是欧洲的第一所医院。
    阿拉伯的物理学和化学
    阿拉伯人对于物理学最有贡献的是伊本·海赛姆（965—1039）。欧几里得发明“投射角与反射角相等”的定律，伊本·海赛姆的补充是：“投射角与反射角常在同一平面上”。他研究过球面镜、抛物性曲面镜、三棱镜，更进而研究晨昏蒙影。他首先解释人眼的构造，并说明物体上的光线反射入人目而生视觉，他纠正了希腊科学家的错误，他们认为光线是从眼睛中发出的。
    他的著作有光学书、夕照论、物影论、火镜论、测量原理。第一、二种早已译成拉丁文，后面三种在1907年译成德文。我们所用的网膜、角膜、玻璃液等术语都是由他的光学书译来的。他的著作曾帮助罗哲·培根和维特罗在西方建立了科学的光学。现代光学是以他的学说为基础的，所以他是光学的鼻祖。
    阿拉伯人曾发明求固体和液体比重的定理，并且制出极精密的比重表。
    伍麦耶王朝的亲王哈立德（704年死）首先翻译希腊和埃及的炼金术，而亲自研究。埃及是西方炼金术的策源地，故阿拉伯人取得埃及的炼金术后，在埃及国名上加阿拉伯文的冠词al，而称炼金术为al—kimiya，后来变成拉丁的alchimia，再变成英文的alchemy。又英文称炼金术家为alchemist，后来把阿拉伯文的冠词去掉，就变成化学家的名称chemist，从此又变出化学的名称chemistry。有许多化学术语是沿用阿拉伯文的，如alcohol（酒精），alizarin（茜草精）、alkali（硷）等。由此可见，古代的炼金术发展成为现代的工业化学，当归功于阿拉伯人。
    八世纪时在化学上最负盛名的查比尔（公元702—765），是燃素说的创始者。他的威权统治欧洲化学界几达千年之久。十三世纪时英国科学家罗哲·培根称他为“灵悟哲人”。
    我们从查比尔的著作可以看出阿拉伯的化学是由实验而进步的，他们曾制明矾、绿矾、硇砂、硼砂、朱砂、珠灰、酒精、酒石精、升汞、硫酸、硝酸、硝酸银、王水、炭酸钠，他们从酒糟中得苛性钾，从海藻中得苛性钠，从水银中得氯化汞。蒸溜、清滤、结晶、升华、煅烧等化学方法都是他们所熟知而且常用的。著名的医学家兼化学家拉齐曾将化学知识运用到医学实际上去。他的著作“秘典”译成拉丁文后被当做化学知识的宝库，沿用到十四世纪。
    结语
    阿拉伯人对于人类文化的贡献有下列三点：
    （1）保全了古代希腊的文化，而且根据自己辛勤的长期劳动，加以补充修正，发扬光大。阿拉伯人是好学深思的，他们愿意学习一切有用的东西，而且善于组织，用逻辑的方法，把各种学问组织得有条有理。他们最擅长的是分门别类，列举条目。他们对于学术的发扬和贡献，仅此一端已足以说明，何况他们对于世界的科学有继往开来，承先启后的伟大劳绩呢。
    （2）阿拉伯的科学家具有实事求是的精神，他们以经验阅历为知识的基础，各科的理论，必须以经验作根据，他们才肯接受。他们治学的方法是：试验观察，获得知识；欧洲人的方法，直到十世纪时候还是：熟读书本，紧记师言，造就学问。罗哲·培根受到阿拉伯人的影响之后，以试验观察为治学的方法，以代替严守师承，固执书本，欧洲的学术才获得了解放。
    （3）把中国的造纸术、印刷术、指南针、火药等重大发明和印度的糖、稻米、棉花等传入欧洲，促进了世界文化的发展，丰富了欧洲各国人民的生活。
    现在阿拉伯各国人民已经觉醒了，他们在争取掌握自己的命运，继承他们祖先光荣的文化传统，以对于人类文化作出伟大的贡献。
