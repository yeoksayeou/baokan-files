Xinhua News Agency, 1st: The Beijing celebration of the seventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China was held today in Tiananmen Square.

Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and other national leaders all participated in today's meeting and reviewed the People's Liberation Army troops and the mass parade from the Tiananmen review stand.

Indonesian President Sukarno and Nepalese Prime Minister Acharya joined Chairman Mao Zedong in the review.

Representatives from more than fifty countries' Communist, Workers', Labour, Labour People's, and People's Revolutionary parties, who are attending the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, observed the ceremony at Tiananmen.

The viewing platforms in front of Tiananmen were filled with spectators. They included foreign guests from more than fifty countries invited to observe the ceremony and currently visiting China, diplomatic envoys and officials from various countries' embassies in China, experts from the Soviet Union, people's democratic countries, and other countries currently assisting in China's construction, delegates to the Eighth National Congress of the CPC, and leaders from central and Beijing municipal organizations and groups, totaling more than 13,000 people.

Marshal Peng Dehuai, accompanied by General Yang Chengwu, Commander-in-Chief of the parade, reviewed the various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and then ascended the Tiananmen review stand to read the order of the Ministry of National Defense.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said that in the past year, the people of our country have achieved a decisive victory in the cause of socialist transformation, and the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy is likely to be overfulfilled.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said that the achievements of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China will surely further inspire the production and work enthusiasm of the people of the whole country, enhance the unity of the people of the whole country and national unity, and enhance the confidence of the people of the whole country to strive to build our country into a great socialist industrialized country.

In his order, Marshal Peng Dehuai called on all officers and soldiers to continue to strengthen unity, strive to learn modern military science knowledge, heighten vigilance, and fight for the liberation of Taiwan, the defense of socialist construction, and the defense of world peace.

Then, the march-past began. The teams from the Military Academy, Infantry School, Artillery School, Engineering Corps School, Tank School, Aviation School, and Naval School, as well as sailors, public security forces, infantry divisions, motorized infantry, paratroopers, artillery units, and tank units, successively passed through Tiananmen Square.

Today, Beijing has been raining since morning. The teams being reviewed looked particularly energetic as they proceeded in the rain.

The troops participating in the review were equipped with various new weapons and vehicles manufactured in our own country.

Among the troops reviewed today were new soldiers who had been conscripted into military service after the implementation of the compulsory military service system. After more than half a year of regular training, many of them have grown into excellent shooters and various technical experts.

Today, Tiananmen Square was decorated even more magnificently. In the center of Tiananmen Square was a giant statue of Chairman Mao Zedong. A portrait of Sun Yat-sen hung on the south side of the square. On both sides of the south were portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The slogan towers at the east and west ends of the red walls read "Long Live Marxism-Leninism!", "Celebrate the Great Victory of Socialism!", "Long Live the Communist Party of China!", "Long Live the People's Republic of China!", and "Long Live World Peace!". On the south side of the square, under countless red flags, stood the masses participating in the celebration meeting.

After the military parade, 500,000 people in the capital held a warm celebration parade in the rain.

According to Xinhua News Agency, 1st: The people of Beijing warmly celebrate the first National Day after achieving a decisive victory in socialist transformation. Today, 500,000 people held a parade in front of Tiananmen. The parading masses cheered for the great achievements in the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan. Today's parade was held in heavy rain, and the parading masses were extremely enthusiastic. The honor guard walked at the forefront of the parade, and thousands of red flags led the joyous crowd through Tiananmen Square. The streets on both sides of the square and the platforms of buildings were crowded with people watching the parade. In the mighty 130,000-strong workers' contingent, many charts showing production achievements and models of various industrial products demonstrated the great victories achieved by the workers in socialist construction. People applauded excitedly to pay tribute to the workers of Beijing's 29 state-owned factories and the city's local industries. Their total output value reached the 1957 level ahead of schedule.

A model of a trolleybus in the parade attracted people's attention. On the eve of National Day, Beijing workers had already manufactured trolleybuses made entirely of domestic materials, which will run on the streets of the capital next year. The workers brought models of many new products. This year, in six months, state-owned industries and local industries in Beijing added 313 new products. Workers used various charts to show their efforts in improving product quality.

The workers participating in the parade expressed their determination to prepare conditions for the realization of the second Five-Year Plan. A red flag fluttered in the workers' team of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, with the golden characters "March towards the International Level" written on it. Behind it were eight brightly colored signs, indicating that eight technical and economic indicators of the plant had reached the advanced domestic level. There were many factory names in the parade that were not seen in last year's National Day parade: the State-owned Beijing No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, Guanting Power Plant, and Machine Tool Switch Factory, among others.

The teams of staff members of state organs used charts and models to illustrate the latest achievements of workers throughout the country. The models of the newly designed oxygen steelmaking converter and the 4,500-ton coastal oil tanker, the panoramic view of Zhanjiang Port, and the model of the Peace-type locomotive recently trial-produced by the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, aroused enthusiastic cheers from the people on the viewing platform. Among the teams of peasants who have become socialist collective laborers, there were many models of grains, vegetables, and fruits, which showed that although the suburbs of Beijing suffered from floods this year, due to their active struggle against natural disasters and the development of sideline production, the income of more than 90% of the members of most agricultural production cooperatives will increase compared with last year.

The team of 20,000 members of handicraft production cooperatives had many exquisite product models.

Among the industrialists and businessmen who participated in the National Day parade for the first time as staff members of joint state-private enterprises, many brought their wives and children. They held up signs with the slogan "Strive to Thoroughly Complete Socialist Transformation."

Walking at the forefront of the entire parade of university and middle school students were more than 7,000 primary school teachers. The female teachers wore beautiful clothes. The 140,000 university and middle school students held musical instruments, bouquets, and colorful silk ribbons. This year, teachers and students from four newly built colleges and universities were added to this team. When each team walked to the review stand, they used various models to express their wishes: "We will master atomic energy and benefit mankind"; "We will build rockets and uncover the secrets of the moon"; "We will pierce through the Qilian Mountains, drill through the Gobi Desert, and let the black gold flow like water." When this team approached the viewing platform, the professors participating in the ceremony waved warmly to them.

The team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences held up signs and banners, expressing their determination to strive for the implementation of the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy and the twelve-year plan for the development of science, and strive to bring many of the most important scientific and technological sectors as close as possible to the world's advanced levels. This year, the staff of nine new scientific research institutions, including the Institute of Mechanics, the Power Research Office, and the Biological and Physiological Research Office, were added to the parade.

The parading masses shouted: "Long Live the People's Republic of China!", "Long Live the Communist Party of China!", "Long Live Chairman Mao!"

Peng Zhen, the mayor of Beijing, shouted on the review stand: "Long Live the Worker Comrades!", "Long Live the Peasant Comrades!", "Long Live the Staff Comrades!", "Long Live the Teacher and Student Comrades!", "Long Live all the Citizens!"

Many huge balloons rose in the parade, with the slogan "Long Live World Peace" on them. The parading people constantly cheered and waved to the dignitaries and international friends on the review stand and the viewing platform, thanking the working class and people of all countries for their support to our country.

The people of Beijing are very concerned about the struggle of the people of Egypt and Asian and African countries to safeguard their sovereignty and independence. In the parade, there were many slogans about supporting Egypt and strengthening the unity of the people of Asian and African countries.

The literary and art contingent, which has always been the most attractive, was even richer and more colorful today. Forty-eight male lions competed for eight embroidered balls, making the square a scene of boiling excitement. The dances of various ethnic groups in our country also gathered together, performing and marching to the accompaniment of music.

When the sports contingent passed through Tiananmen Square, the young male and female athletes performed various beautiful performances vigorously in the rain, arousing enthusiastic applause from the people on the viewing platform. After the sports contingent passed Tiananmen Square, the three-hour mass parade ended. At this time, the crowd standing on the south side of Tiananmen Square cheered and surged towards the review stand. Chairman Mao Zedong and the leaders of the Party and the state walked to both sides of the review stand, waved to the revelers, and thanked the international friends on the viewing platform.
