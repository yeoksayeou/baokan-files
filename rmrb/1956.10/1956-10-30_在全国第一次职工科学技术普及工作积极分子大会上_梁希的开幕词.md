Comrades Representatives, Guests:

The first National Congress of Activists in Science and Technology Popularization for Workers, jointly convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, is now open.

Before we convened this congress, twenty-two provinces, two autonomous regions, and three municipalities directly under the central government, as well as thirty-nine municipalities under the jurisdiction of provinces, had already held congresses of activists in science and technology popularization for workers, and either elected or invited activists in science and technology popularization for workers. Attending this congress are scientific and technological workers, cadres of science and technology popularization associations, trade union workers, and worker comrades who are enthusiastic about science and technology popularization, selected from all over the country, as well as representatives invited from the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, and the Ministry of Agriculture. We, these representatives who are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Chinese Communist Party and actively marching towards science and technology, are gathered here to review the achievements of the national science and technology popularization work for workers in the past few years, clarify the guiding principles and tasks for future work, exchange our experiences in work and study, and more extensively carry out science and technology popularization work for workers, so as to create better conditions for the nationwide workers' march towards science and technology and the further development of the advanced producers movement. Therefore, this congress of ours can be said to be a congress to further mobilize the nation's workers to march towards science and technology.

Comrades! As we convene this congress, our country's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy is about to be successfully completed, and the Eighth National Congress of the Party has already put forward important instructions for us regarding the second Five-Year Plan. Now, the central task before the people of the whole country and the working class is to strive to overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan and actively prepare for the second Five-Year Plan. There is no doubt that to accomplish this great task, we must have a higher level of science and technology and a large number of skilled workers and management personnel. However, our country's scientific and technological level has not yet shaken off its backward state, and the scientific and technological level of our vast number of workers cannot keep up with the needs of the country. This situation requires our scientific and technological workers to bravely shoulder a dual historical task: on the one hand, to improve their professional level and strive to ensure that our country's most urgently needed scientific departments can approach the advanced world level by the end of the third Five-Year Plan period; on the other hand, to popularize scientific and technological knowledge to the broad masses of the working people, especially the vast number of workers, so that our country has sufficient construction strength. This situation also requires the vast number of workers to actively march towards science and technology and strive to improve their scientific and technological level. Science and technology popularization work is of great significance in our country's socialist economic construction.

Science and technology popularization work is a new work, and it is also a creative work. In the past few years, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, the efforts of the broad masses of scientific and technological workers, and the joint cooperation of science and technology popularization associations, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and other relevant departments, our country's science and technology popularization cause has made certain achievements. The widespread development of science and technology popularization work among workers will undoubtedly play an important role in our country's socialist construction cause. In carrying out this work, we have explored some experiences and encountered many problems in the past few years. This congress is to summarize past experiences and solve the problems that exist in our work.

We believe that through this congress, we will be able to make our work more widespread, thereby improving the scientific and technological level of the broad masses of workers, strengthening and consolidating the alliance between our country's working people and intellectuals, and effectively promoting our country's socialist economic construction. I wish the congress a success!

    在全国第一次职工科学技术普及工作积极分子大会上
    梁希的开幕词代表们，来宾们：
    中华全国总工会和中华全国科学技术普及协会联合召开的全国第一次职工科学技术普及工作积极分子大会，现在开幕了。
    在我们召开这次大会以前，全国已经有二十二个省、两个自治区、三个直辖市及三十九个省辖市或者举行职工科学技术普及工作积极分子大会，进行了选举，或者采取邀请方式，产生了职工科学技术普及工作的积极分子。出席这次大会的，是全国各地选出的热心从事职工科学技术普及工作的科学技术工作者、科学技术普及协会的干部和工会工作者以及积极学习科学技术的职工同志们，此外，还有中国人民解放军、中华人民共和国文化部和农业部邀请来会的代表同志们。我们这些热烈响应中国共产党的号召、积极向科学技术进军中的代表们聚会在这里，是为了检阅几年来全国职工科学技术普及工作的成就，明确今后工作的方针和任务，交流我们工作和学习中的经验，更加广泛地开展职工科学技术普及工作，为全国职工向科学技术进军以及为先进生产者运动的进一步开展创造更好的条件。因此，我们这次大会，可以说是进一步动员全国职工向科学技术进军的大会。
    同志们！在我们召开这次大会的时候，我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划不久就要胜利完成了，党的第八次全国代表大会已经为我们提出了关于第二个五年计划的重要指示。现在，摆在全国人民和工人阶级面前的中心任务，就是争取超额完成第一个五年计划和积极准备第二个五年计划。毫无疑义，要完成这个伟大的任务，必须有较高的科学技术水平和大量技术高明的工人和管理人员。然而，我国的科学技术水平还没有摆脱落后状态，我国广大职工的科学技术是赶不上国家需要的。这种情况，要求我国科学技术工作者们勇敢地担当起双重的历史任务：这就是一方面提高自己的业务水平，争取在第三个五年计划期末使我国最急需的科学部门能够接近世界先进水平；另一方面把科学技术知识普及给广大劳动人民，尤其是广大职工，使我国拥有足够的建设力量。这种情况也要求广大职工积极向科学技术进军，努力提高自己的科学技术水平。科学技术普及工作在我国的社会主义经济建设中是具有重大意义的。
    科学技术普及工作是一种新的工作，也是一种创造性的工作。在过去几年中，由于党的正确领导、广大的科学技术工作者的努力以及科学技术普及协会、工会、青年团以及其他有关部门的共同配合，使我国科学技术普及事业有了一定的成就。科学技术普及工作在职工中的广泛开展，无疑地对于我国的社会主义建设事业会起着重要的作用。在进行这一工作中，几年来我们已经摸索出一些经验，也遇到不少问题。这次大会就是要总结过去的经验，解决我们工作中存在的问题。
    我们相信，通过这次大会，一定能够使我们的工作更加广泛地开展起来，从而提高广大职工的科学技术水平，加强和巩固我国劳动人民和知识分子的联盟，有效地促进我国的社会主义经济建设。我预祝大会成功！
