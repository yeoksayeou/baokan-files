After watching the movie "Hua Mulan," I felt that Comrade Chang Xiangyu, who played Mulan, performed wonderfully and sang exquisitely. This is universally acknowledged and need not be discussed. However, the movie's set design caused some audience members to leave midway. Why? They said they couldn't bear to watch it. Especially in scenes that were not intended to be comedic, the audience burst into laughter. Isn't this something to "ponder deeply"?

Since they were using a real loom to weave fabric, why didn't we see the warp and weft threads or the rolled-up cloth? Mulan's shuttle went back and forth on this empty machine, and so everyone laughed.

Since there were real mountains, real water, and real houses, when Mulan's family saw her off to the countryside, we thought the horse she was leading would be real, right? No, it was still the whip commonly seen on the opera stage. So, everyone laughed again. Especially when Mulan and her "companion" of "twelve years" appeared together in "Yanshan" or "Black Water Head," we only saw them waving their whips and not riding horses. Thus, the audience roared with laughter.

This disharmony destroys the complete beauty of the art. Where lies the problem?

It is very clear. It is that the symbolic artistic expression of Chinese tradition contradicts and clashes with the so-called realistic artistic expression of some experts, which damages our art.

The traditional form of Chinese art has its unique style. For example, in painting (traditional Chinese painting), whether it is figures, landscapes, or flowers and birds, the theme is prominently displayed, while the background is not emphasized much. Similarly, opera does not focus on set design: climbing mountains can be done on tables, riding horses can be done with a whip; going upstairs involves quick steps and footwork, entering a door involves bowing the head and lifting a leg; boarding a boat or going underwater, drawing swords and wielding weapons, all emphasize the character's performance and dance movements. As long as the singing and acting are excellent, it is considered top-notch; the audience will praise it endlessly, considering it to be full of emotion and scenery, lifelike and vivid.

Aren't we very accustomed to this tradition? Isn't it very unified in art? Should it be changed? I think it can be changed. For example, the uniform use of one table and several chairs in every scene can be altered. Just change the appearance so that people know the location has changed, and that would be good enough; but the background should still be simple and unadorned. This will not hinder dance movements and will concentrate the viewer's attention; it will not overshadow the main subject and will avoid an empty backdrop—some different symbolic decorations and props would be enough. But this is not easy and requires expert design. I think this is called development on the basis of tradition, which is to say, making necessary modifications to the heritage's style. To use film to express opera, apart from slightly embellishing the background, it is best to adopt a stage recording format!

Otherwise, simply completely adapt the singing and dancing opera into a non-singing and non-dancing drama form. Then, real mountains, real water, real cars, real horses, real houses, and real furniture can all be realistic. But if that is the case, costume design must be carefully studied, and the colors of the era must be distinct. For example, the jade bi returned intact by Lin Xiangru, and the mirror mended by Princess Lechang, should be antique and reasonable, conforming to historical reality and imbued with the atmosphere of the dynasty. That would be something. But in the movie "Hua Mulan," the mirror Mulan looked into was not a bronze mirror with flower patterns, but a square glass mirror, which was impossible at the time. In particular, walking fake horses in real mountains and real water is considered a "bold creation," but why do people laugh? If Mulan rode a real horse, that would be a thorough reform, but Chang Xiangyu's dance would be completely eliminated. How should we treat our country's artistic traditions? Please, experts, consider.

However, this movie is still worth seeing, because the audience wants to see the opera, not the scenery, and Comrade Chang Xiangyu's beautiful opera art is still worth appreciating.

    电影“花木兰”里的矛盾
    余吾家
    看了电影“花木兰”以后，觉得饰木兰的常香玉同志，演得真好，唱得真妙，这是人所共晓的，可不必论。但是，那电影的布景，却使得有些观众中途走开了。为什么？说是看不下去。尤其是在并非滑稽的场面中，观众笑声大作。这，还不可以“深长思之”吗？
    既然是在真的织布机上织布，为什么没有看见经纬线和布匹卷呢？木兰手中的梭，在这架空洞的机子上，穿来又穿去，于是，大家笑了。
    既然是真山、真水、真房屋，那么，当木兰全家送她到郊外的时候，牵过来的，我们想这该是真马了吧？不，还是一条戏曲舞台上所习见的鞭子，于是大家又笑了。特别是当木兰和她那“同行十二年”的“伙伴”，一同出现在“燕山”或“黑水头”的时候，只见扬鞭，不见走马，于是观众又哄笑起来了。
    这种不调和，把艺术的完整美破坏了。问题在那里？
    很清楚。这就是，中国传统的象征的艺术表现手法，同一些专家的所谓现实的艺术表现手法有矛盾、相抵触，这就使我国艺术受损害了。
    中国的艺术传统形式是有其独特风格的。如绘画（国画），不论人物、山水、花鸟，都是突出地表现主题，而不大表现背景的。同样的，戏曲也不重布景：登山可以上桌子，骑马可以甩鞭子；上楼就碎步跳脚，进门就低头搭腿；上船下水，拨刀弄棒，都重在人物表演，舞蹈身段。只要唱做俱佳，便是上乘；观众也会赞不绝口，认为是有情有景，唯妙唯肖了。
    这样的传统，我们不是很习惯了吗？在艺术上不是很统一的吗？要不要改动？我以为是可以改的，如千篇一律的一张桌子、几把椅子，场场都如此，那是可以有所变动的。只要变变样子，使人看了知道是换了场所，这就好了；而背景仍然要简单朴素。这既不妨碍舞蹈动作，又能集中观者视线；既不致于喧宾夺主，更能避免后幕空虚——有些不同的象征性装饰和道具就已够了。但这并非易事，还要专家设计。我想，这就叫做在传统的基础上发展，也就是在遗产的风格上作必要的加工。用电影来表现戏曲，除背景略加渲染外，最好还是采取舞台记录形式吧！
    要不，干脆把载歌载舞的戏曲，完全改编成不歌不舞的话剧形式，那倒是真山、真水、真车、真马、真房屋和真家具，全可以现实化。但如果那样时，服装设计还须考究，时代色彩也要鲜明。比方完璧归赵的璧，破镜重圆的镜，都应是古色古香，入情入理，使其合乎历史现实，让它富有朝代气氛，那也算事。但在电影“花木兰”中，木兰所照的镜子并非菱花铜镜，而是当时不可能有的玻璃方镜。特别是真山真水中走假马，算是“大胆的创造”了，怎奈人家要笑？木兰若上了真马那才是彻底改革，可是常香玉的舞蹈也就被彻底消灭了。究竟应当如何对待我国艺术传统呢？请专家考虑。
    但是，这电影还是可以去看的，因为观众要看的是戏而不是景，常香玉同志的优美戏曲艺术还是值得欣赏的。
