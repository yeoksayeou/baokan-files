    Two Little Lives in Lu Xun's Novels
    Xu Gan
    In the story "Tomorrow," consistent with the attitude in "Father's Illness" from "Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk," Mr. Lu Xun's stern gaze is directed at the two fingers of the quack doctor.
    In the story, Bao'er, the son of the widow Shan Si Sao, who makes a living by spinning yarn day and night, falls ill. According to Mr. Lu Xun, who understood medicine, the illness was chronic pneumonia, not incurable. However, Shan Si Sao was poor and superstitious. Her three-step approach was: first, seek a divine oracle; second, make a vow; and third, take a folk remedy. Only when all three proved ineffective did she reluctantly spend four silver dollars to take the child to He Xiaoxian for a diagnosis.
    A few words should be inserted here: At that time, there were two well-known He families in Shaoxing City. One was the blind He, who told fortunes, arranged birthdates, and chose auspicious days for weddings and funerals. The other was the family that had practiced medicine for generations. The quack doctor in Mr. Lu Xun's writing was named He in "Diary of a Madman," referred to only as Mr. He. Here, he is called He Xiaoxian, complete with his first and last name. In "Father's Illness," the surname became Chen, and the name was Chen Lianhe, actually a reversal of three homophones. In fact, the real name of the He family's generation of doctors who treated Mr. Lu Xun's father and exhausted remedies like "original cricket" was He Lianchen (may his soul rest in peace; he was the author's maternal uncle). Therefore, the model for the three doctors is the same person.
    In the novel "Tomorrow," Mr. Lu Xun used economical strokes to create a typical portrayal of He Xiaoxian. He extended "two fingers with fingernails more than four inches long" to press on the pulse of the dying child in Shan Si Sao's arms. He answered Shan Si Sao, who placed all her hopes on him, with only two and a half sentences. The first sentence was jargon: "His middle burner is blocked"; the second sentence was evasive: "Go and take two doses first"; and the half sentence was mysterious professional jargon: "This is fire overcoming metal..." After saying this, he closed his eyes, meaning that he still had to see the next patient, and she could leave. Shan Si Sao, like a rural woman who felt somewhat intimidated by famous doctors, dared not ask any more questions and carried Bao'er away. And Bao'er, after taking the first dose of medicine, which had to be bought from Jia's Jishi Old Shop's secret "Infant Saving Elixir," became seriously ill that day, called out "Mom," and his breathing went from steady to non-existent.
    The two little lives in the two novels, one was ruined by an evil folk remedy, and the other was ruined by a carelessly prescribed prescription. Mr. Lu Xun had a personal experience of pain at that time (his fourth younger brother died of pneumonia at the age of six). Thinking about it now, we are also filled with lingering fear. Anyone who has ever had beloved children, siblings, or younger siblings taken away by disease compounded by human factors will feel a particularly painful wound in their heart when they read it.
    I don't want to use this as an excuse to say that all folk remedies are inedible. Although some folk remedies cannot be explained, they can indeed cure diseases, and they have indeed saved people for thousands of years; but there are also many who fantasize and spread rumors, leading to the loss of innocent lives. Most of these people who died unjustly do not have the "qualifications" to be written about in books, or if they are written about, very few people pay attention. (To be continued from yesterday)

    鲁迅小说里的两条小命
    徐淦
    在“明天”这篇小说里，与“朝华夕拾”中“父亲的病”里的态度一致，鲁迅先生的横眉所怒对的，是庸医的两个指头。
    日夜纺纱为生的寡妇单四嫂子的儿子宝儿病了，那病，照懂得医道的鲁迅先生的描写，是慢性肺炎，并非不治之症。但是，单四嫂子贫穷而又迷信，她那三部曲是：一求神签，二许愿心，三吃单方。直到三者都不见效，她才不得不花四角银元，把孩子抱到何家去诊何小仙了。
    这里要插上几句：绍兴城里当时有两个远近闻名的何家，一家是算命排八字拣婚葬吉日的何瞎子，还有一家就是世代行医的了。鲁迅先生笔下的庸医，在“狂人日记”里姓何，只称何先生，在这里就连名带姓叫何小仙；在“父亲的病”里姓了陈，叫陈莲河，其实是用同音的三个字翻了个身，原来何家这一代行医，给鲁迅先生的父亲治病用尽了“原配蟋蟀”一类药引的，他那真实的姓名是何廉臣（愿他的在天之灵平安，他是笔者的姨老爷）。所以，三个医生的模特儿是一个。
    小说“明天”里面的何小仙，鲁迅先生用经济的笔墨作了典型化的刻划，他对单四嫂子怀抱中的奄奄一息的孩子，伸出“指甲足有四寸多长”的两个指头按了按脉，回答把全部期望寄托给他的单四嫂子的话，只说了两句半，第一句是术语：“他中焦塞着”；第二句是敷衍：“先去吃两帖”；还有半句是玄之又玄的行话：“这是火克金……”。说完，他闭上了眼睛，那意思是他还要看下一个，你可以走了。单四嫂子像见了名医都有三分畏缩的乡下妇女一样，不敢再问，抱起宝儿走了。而宝儿，在吃下了第一味必须买贾家济世老店秘制的“保婴活命丸”的那剂药之后，当天病重，叫了一声“妈”，呼吸就从平稳到没有了。
    两篇小说里的两条小命，一条是邪门的单方断送的，一条是乱开的药方断送的。鲁迅先生当时固有切肤之痛（他的四弟六岁时死于肺炎），我们现在想想也心有余悸，凡是曾经被疾病加人为的因素夺走过亲爱的子女弟妹的人，读了更都会格外地触到心头的创痛。
    我并不想借题发挥，说一切单方都吃不得。单方，虽然说不出道理而确能治病的并非没有，千百年来它也真的救过人；但是想入非非、以讹传讹，以致草菅人命的也实在不少。这种死得冤枉的人，大都没有“资格”让人笔之于书或者写了也很少人注意。（续昨，未完）
