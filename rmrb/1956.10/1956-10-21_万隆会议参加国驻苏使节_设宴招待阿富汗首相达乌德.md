Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th—According to TASS, Moscow: On October 19th, the diplomatic envoys to the Soviet Union from countries that participated in the Bandung Conference hosted a banquet in Moscow in honor of the visiting Afghan Prime Minister, Mohammed Daoud. During the banquet, Nguyen Luong Bang, the Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the Soviet Union, welcomed the Afghan Prime Minister on behalf of all the ambassadors. He said: "Like the gatherings we held in the past to entertain the leaders of India, Burma, and Indonesia, this banquet once again proves the unity of the Asian and African countries and is a new testament to the correctness of the policy of peaceful coexistence and anti-colonialism established by the Bandung Conference."

Indian Ambassador K. Menon spoke at the banquet. He said that the independence of Afghanistan, the independence of India, and other Asian and African countries makes it possible for us to gather here today.

Then, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, spoke. He said that it has become a good tradition in Moscow for the diplomatic envoys of the Bandung Conference participating countries in the Soviet Union to hold gatherings to welcome our Asian and African guests. This proves the strengthening of the unity of the Asian and African countries and proves the victory of the principle of peaceful coexistence, which is the basis of the Bandung Conference resolutions.

Bulganin said that the Soviet Union, in its relations with Asian and African countries, has always unswervingly pursued the principles declared by the Bandung Conference. We sincerely hope to further develop the friendship between the Soviet people and the people of Asian and African countries and to carry out effective cooperation with each other. We are deeply convinced that the Afghan Prime Minister's visit to our country will help further consolidate the friendship between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan and will help the principle of international friendly and equal cooperation declared by the Bandung Conference to achieve victory.

Subsequently, Mohammed Daoud spoke. He thanked everyone for their welcome. He said, "I will remember the fact that I am here today to participate in your gathering as an unforgettable and significant event. Following the principles of establishing and maintaining friendly relations between all peoples and nations is the foundation of this visit."

The Afghan Prime Minister said that Afghanistan is a peace-loving and neutral country. The Afghan government believes that in our time, no one can be indifferent to anything, big or small, that happens anywhere, near or far. Therefore, the world equally needs the individual and collective cooperation of all peoples and countries to eliminate bad ideas and phenomena. Afghanistan, considering its neutral policy, respecting its obligations under the UN Charter, and in order to maintain good relations with the people of all countries, will therefore respect the Bandung Principles and will always unswervingly support these principles.

    据新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：10月19日，万隆会议参加国驻苏联的外交使节在莫斯科设宴招待正在苏联访问的阿富汗首相穆罕默德·达乌德。在宴会席上，越南民主共和国驻苏联大使阮良朋代表各国大使欢迎阿富汗首相。他说：像我们过去举行的招待印度、缅甸和印度尼西亚领导人的聚会一样，这次宴会又一次证明了亚非国家的团结一致，而且也是万隆会议所确定的和平共处和反殖民主义政策的正确性的一个新证明。
    印度大使克·梅农在宴会上讲了话。他说，阿富汗的独立，印度和其他亚非国家的独立，使我们今天有可能在这里聚会一堂。
    接着，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁讲话。他说，万隆会议参加国驻苏联的外交使节为欢迎我们的亚非国家客人而举行聚会，这在我们莫斯科已经成为一种好的传统。这证明了亚非国家的团结的加强，证明了作为万隆会议决议的基础的和平共处原则的胜利。
    布尔加宁说，苏联在同亚非国家的相互关系中，始终不渝地奉行万隆会议所宣布的原则。我们衷心希望能够进一步发展苏联人民同亚非国家人民的友谊和彼此之间进行有效的合作。我们深信，阿富汗首相访问我国，将有助于苏联和阿富汗两国之间的友谊的进一步巩固，将有助于万隆会议所宣布的国际友好平等合作的原则获得胜利。
    随后，穆罕默德·达乌德讲了话。他感谢大家对他的欢迎。他说，我要把今天来参加你们的聚会这件事作为一件难忘的、有重要意义的事件来记住它。遵循建立和维护各国人民和民族之间的友好关系的原则是我们这次访问的基础。
    阿富汗首相说，阿富汗是一个爱好和平的中立国家。阿富汗政府认为，在我们这个时代，对任何人来讲，无论在远远近近的地方所发生的大大小小的任何一件事，都不能漠不关心。因此，全世界都同样地需要各国人民和国家的单独和集体的合作，以消除不良的想法和现象。阿富汗由于考虑到自己的中立政策，尊重自己根据联合国宪章所承担的义务，以及为了保持同世界各国人民的良好关系，因而将尊重万隆原则，并且始终不渝地支持这些原则。
