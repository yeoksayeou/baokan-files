    Wangting Thermal Power Plant
    (Xinhua Daily News) The Wangting Power Plant of the Shanghai Electric Power Administration, the first large-scale thermal power plant built in East China since liberation, officially began construction on October 25.
    The equipment for this power plant mostly comes from Czechoslovakia and has a high degree of automation. After the power plant is completed, ultra-high voltage transmission lines will be erected between it, the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station in Zhejiang, and Shanghai to form a large power grid in the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou triangle area, supplying electricity for industrial and agricultural production and civilian use in Shanghai and the Jiangnan area. The plant strives to achieve partial operation of machinery and furnaces by the end of next year; the first phase of the project is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 1958. At that time, the electricity supply will be equivalent to 66.4% of the total existing power capacity of Jiangsu Province.
    On the 480 mu of fields now, thousands of construction workers are working intensely at the construction site. At several major construction sites, the night is like day, and the rumbling of concrete mixers and the flashing of electric welding are continuous throughout the night.

    望亭火力发电厂
    据新华日报消息　华东地区解放以来新建的第一个大型火力发电厂——上海电业管理局望亭发电厂，已于10月25日正式开工兴建。
    这一电厂的设备大部分来自捷克斯洛伐克，自动化程度很高。电厂建成后，将同浙江新安江水力发电站和上海之间架设超高压输电线，组成沪宁杭三角地区大输电网，供应上海和江南地区工农业生产用电和民用电。该厂明年年底争取做到部分机炉送电；1958年第三季度可完成第一期工程。那时，使电量将相当于江苏省现有电力总容量的66.4％。
    现在四百八十亩的田野上，数千建筑工人在工地紧张劳动着。在几个主要工地上，入夜如同白昼，混凝土搅拌机的轧轧声和电焊的闪光通宵不绝。
