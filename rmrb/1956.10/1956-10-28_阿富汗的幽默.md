Afghan Humor

    Delicious Pilaf
    A man went to visit someone. Naturally, the host invited him to the table and treated him with pilaf. As the guest ate the pilaf, he crunched on some sand.
    "Is there sand?" the solicitous and hospitable host asked.
      "No, there's also rice," the guest replied coldly.
    Excessive Politeness
    A man was sitting in the blazing sun writing a letter to his beloved girl. At the end, he put a period, thought for a moment, and added a sentence at the end of the letter: "Forgive me, my flower of the soul, I was only wearing a vest while writing this letter. But, please believe me, it was so hot that I had no choice."
    Clever Son
    A funeral procession passed by on the street, and a child standing at the doorway asked his father:
      "Where are they taking this person?"
    The father shook his head sadly:
      "My son, they are taking him to a place with no table, no chairs, no carpet, and not a single lamp."
    The child exclaimed: "That means they're bringing him to our house!"

    阿富汗的幽默
    可口的抓饭
    有一个人去做客，自然，主人就请他上桌，用抓饭来款待他。客人吃着抓饭，却嚼到了一些沙子。
    “怎么，有沙子吗？”殷勤好客的主人问道。
      “不，也有饭。”客人冷冷地回答。
    过分的礼貌
    一个人坐在炽烈的阳光下给自己心爱的姑娘写信。写到最后他打上了一个句点，想了一下又在信的末尾加上了一句话：“原谅我，我心灵上的花朵，我在写信时只穿着一件背心。但，请你相信，热得实在使我没有办法了。”
    机敏的儿子
    送葬的人群在街上走过，一个站在大门口的孩子问他的父亲：
      “他们要把这个人送到那里去啊？”
    父亲悲痛地摇摇头：
      “我的儿子，人们要把他送到一个没有桌子，没有椅子，没有地毡，也没有一盏灯的地方去。”
    孩子喊了起来：“那就是说，要把他送到我们家里来了啊！”
