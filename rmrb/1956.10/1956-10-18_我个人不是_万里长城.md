    I Personally Am Not the "Great Wall"
    After our Beijing Youth Football Team played a friendly match against the Pakistan National Football Team on September 30th, I saw Xinhua News Agency's report on the game on the third page of the People's Daily on October 1st. I felt that some parts of the report were inappropriate. The victory of the game was the result of the efforts of every player in the team, and it could not be attributed to the credit of one person. The report was very short, but the sentences praising me accounted for nearly half of it. The report also mentioned that I "was once praised as the 'impregnable Great Wall' at the World Youth and Student Festival last year." In fact, that refers to the Chinese team's defense being like the Great Wall, not that I alone am the Great Wall. I hope the news agency and the newspaper will carefully consider my opinion, and I hope that in future reports, more of our shortcomings will be pointed out.

### 我个人不是“万里长城”

    我个人不是“万里长城”
    我们北京青年足球队9月30日同巴基斯坦国家足球队进行友谊比赛之后，我在10月1日的人民日报第三版上看到新华社关于这场比赛的报道。我感到这个报道有些地方写得很不恰当。比赛的胜利是全队每个队员努力的结果，不可能是一个人的功劳。那篇报道很短，但表扬我的句子就占了将近一半。报道中还说到我“曾经在去年世界青年与学生联欢节被誉为‘难以攻破的万里长城’”。其实，那是指中国队的后卫防守像万里长城一样，并不是说我一个人是万里长城。希望通讯社和报纸慎重考虑我的意见，更希望今后在报道中多指出我们的缺点。（北京青年足球队守门员  张俊秀）
