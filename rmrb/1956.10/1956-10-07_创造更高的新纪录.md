    Create Higher New Records
    The selection competition for the Chinese Olympic team will open in Beijing today. We warmly wish this selection competition a success.
    The All-China Sports Federation (Chinese Olympic Committee) has been working hard in all aspects to prepare for the 16th Olympic Games to be held in Melbourne, Australia, in November this year. For more than a year, competitions of various events have been held throughout the country. In the first half of 1956 alone, 3,411 provincial-level sports meets and 19 national individual events were held. In particular, the reward measures for sports meets at all levels and the regulations on the grading system for athletes and referees, which were announced in the first half of this year, have greatly encouraged and promoted the vast number of young athletes in our country, and a large number of young and outstanding athletes have emerged. They are constantly improving their athletic performance day and night. This selection competition will greatly encourage our athletes to work hard to create new sports records to meet the ardent expectations of the people of the whole country. The results of the athletes' hard training will be reviewed in this selection competition and further improve their athletic performance.
    The participants in this selection competition include athletes from all over the country. In addition, the Organizing Committee for the Participation of China in the 16th Olympic Games also issued a notice welcoming athletes from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau to participate in the selection competition in Beijing. This call aroused a warm response from the sports circles in Hong Kong and Macau. Many well-known figures in the sports circles delivered speeches, believing that this is an honor that the motherland has given to the athletes in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau, and it is also the responsibility that the athletes in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau should fulfill to the motherland. The athletes in Hong Kong and Macau are very excited to sign up for this selection competition. Among the athletes who have arrived in Beijing to participate in this selection competition, many are first-class athletes in Hong Kong and Macau, and they have made outstanding achievements in many competitions. We warmly welcome them to participate in this selection competition.
    As of now, athletes from Taiwan Province have still not been able to come to participate in the selection competition. We believe that the athletes in Taiwan Province are very willing to participate in the motherland's selection competition. It is only because of the obstruction of US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique that their wishes cannot be realized. We express our deep sympathy for the current situation of the athletes in Taiwan, and we express our great anger at the acts of US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in preventing athletes from Taiwan from coming to the capital of the motherland to participate in the selection competition and infringing on their legitimate rights. US imperialists have occupied our territory of Taiwan and unreasonably prevented athletes from Taiwan from participating in this national selection competition, which is an act of infringing on China's sovereignty. At the same time, this also violates the Olympic Charter's principle of promoting peace and friendship among people. Taiwan is a province of our country, and the wishes of the athletes in Taiwan will one day be realized.
    In recent years, thanks to the leadership and support of the Party and the People's Government for sports, China's sports have developed greatly, and China's athletes have grown rapidly. However, we must also see that the technical level of our sports is still not high. China only participated in seven events in the 16th Olympic Games. In these seven events, although some of our events have approached or reached the top six in the 15th Olympic Games, the records of the 15th Olympic Games have been broken by athletes from many countries. In order to strive for excellent results in the 16th Olympic Games, athletes across the country need to make great efforts. Comrade Zhou Enlai said in his report at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, "We should further develop sports activities among the masses, effectively enhance the people's physique, and improve the level of sports in our country." This must become the working principle of the Chinese Olympic Committee in the future.
    The people of the whole country are very concerned about this selection competition. The athletes participating in this selection competition should give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity in the competition process, carry forward the fine style of our athletes, hold the attitude of learning from each other and helping each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, and improve together, so as to raise the level of our sports records to a higher level.

    创造更高的新纪录
    中国奥林匹克运动队的选拔比赛，今天将在北京开幕。我们热烈地预祝这次选拔比赛获得成功。
    中华全国体育总会（中国奥林匹克委员会），为了迎接今年11月在澳大利亚墨尔本举行的第十六届奥林匹克运动会，在各方面曾经进行了紧张的准备工作。一年多以来，在全国各地举办了各种项目的竞赛活动。在1956年上半年就举行了省级运动会三千四百十一次，全国性的单项比赛十九次。特别是在今年上半年公布的各级运动会奖励办法，运动员、裁判员等级制度等条例，对我国广大的青年运动员产生了巨大的鼓舞和推动力量，涌现出了大量年轻的优秀运动员。他们在朝夕不断地提高自己的运动成绩。这次选拔比赛，更将大大地鼓舞我国运动员们努力创造新的运动纪录，来回答全国人民对他们的殷切的期望。运动员们平时勤学苦练的成绩，将在这次选拔比赛中得到一次总检阅，并进一步提高他们的运动成绩。
    参加这次选拔比赛的包括了来自各地的运动员。此外，中国参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会筹备委员会还发出通知，欢迎台湾和香港、澳门的运动员来北京参加选拔比赛。这个号召引起港、澳体育界热烈的响应，许多体育界的知名人士发表了谈话，认为这是祖国给予台湾和港、澳运动员的光荣，也是台湾和港、澳运动员对祖国应尽的职责。港、澳的运动员们怀着极为兴奋的心情，报名参加了这次选拔比赛。目前已到达北京参加这次选拔比赛的运动员中，有不少是港、澳第一流的选手，他们都曾经在多次比赛中做出了出色的成绩。我们对于他们前来参加这次选拔比赛，表示热烈的欢迎。
    截至目前为止，台湾省的运动员仍然没有能够前来参加选拔比赛。我们相信，台湾省的运动员们是十分乐意参加祖国的选拔比赛的。只是由于美帝国主义和蒋介石集团的阻挠，他们的愿望无法实现。我们对于台湾运动员目前的处境，表示深切的同情，对于美帝国主义和蒋介石集团阻止台湾运动员前来祖国首都参加选拔比赛、侵犯他们的正当的权利的行为表示极大的愤怒。美帝国主义者霸占了我国的领土台湾，并且无理阻挠台湾运动员参加这次全国的选拔比赛，是侵犯中国主权的行为，同时，这也破坏了奥林匹克宪章关于增进人们之间的和平与友谊的原则。台湾是我国的一个省，台湾运动员们的这种愿望总有一天一定能够实现的。
    几年来，由于党和人民政府对体育事业的领导和支持，我国体育事业有了很大的发展，我国运动员也很快地成长起来。但是，我们也必须看到，我国体育运动的技术水平还是不高的。第十六届奥林匹克运动会的项目中，我国只参加了七个竞赛项目。在这七个项目中，虽然有些项目我们已经接近了或者达到了第十五届奥林匹克运动会六名以内的成绩，但是第十五届奥林匹克运动会的纪录，已经又有很多被不少国家的运动员打破了。为了争取在第十六届奥林匹克运动会上获得优良的成绩，全国运动员们还需要作极大的努力。周恩来同志在中国共产党第八次全国代表大会上的报告中说，“应该在广大群众中进一步开展体育运动，有效地增强人民的体质，并且提高我国体育运动的水平。”这必须成为我国奥林匹克委员会今后的工作方针。
    全国人民十分关心这次选拔比赛。参加这次选拔比赛的运动员，在比赛过程中要充分发挥积极性和创造性，发扬我国运动员的优良作风，抱定互相学习、互相帮助的态度，取长补短，共同提高，把我国的运动纪录提到更高的水平。
