Xinhua News Agency, Blackpool, October 5th: TASS reports that the British Labour Party's annual conference concluded in Blackpool on the morning of October 5th.

    The conference discussed the state of British agriculture and social welfare payments during the closing session.

    A heated discussion unfolded regarding the situation of the British textile industry. Roberts, chairman of the Textile Workers' Union, urged delegates to note that foreign competition in textiles was continuously increasing unemployment in the British textile industry. The conference passed a resolution calling on the government to take necessary measures to "rectify the situation."

    Many delegates spoke about an extremely pressing issue: uniting the ranks of the workers' movement and consolidating world peace. Some speakers severely criticized the Socialist International in this regard. For example, Member of Parliament Davies said, "He often doubts whether the Socialist International truly advocates peaceful solutions to international problems." Delegate Watson, responding on behalf of the Executive Committee, said that the decisions of the Socialist International are not necessarily binding on the Labour Party.

    The conference did not discuss many important issues on the agenda because the Executive Committee insisted on postponing their discussion, citing "insufficient time." These issues included certain revisions to the Party Constitution (one extremely important revision being the strengthening of the representation of local party organizations in the Executive Committee), as well as the issues of industrial nationalization, unemployment, education, healthcare, and so on.

Xinhua News Agency, London, October 7th: TASS reports that the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Gollan, commented on the results of the Labour Party's annual conference in the "Daily Worker" on October 6th, writing: "The sentiment expressed in Blackpool, if translated into concrete policies and actions, will transform the labor movement." However, Gollan pointed out that the Labour Party's annual conference did not fully understand the necessity of uniting all working people, including the Communist Party, on the basis of "new militant policies." Gollan called on ordinary Labour Party members to strive for united action among the British working people to jointly defend their interests.

    Gollan concluded by writing: "The Labour Party's annual conference was a big step forward, demonstrating that the rule of the right wing can no longer contain the development of the workers' movement. We demand continued progress, to overcome the forces that oppose the unity of the entire workers' movement."

    英国工党年会闭幕
    布莱克浦的情绪如果成为具体行动，将使劳工运动发生转变。年会说明右翼的统治再也不能遏制工人运动的发展。——英共总书记高兰的评论
    据新华社7日讯　塔斯社布莱克浦5日讯：英国工党年会10月5日上午在布莱克浦闭幕。
    在闭幕会上讨论了英国农业状况和社会赡养费的问题。
    在关于英国纺织业境况的问题上展开了热烈的讨论。纺织工人联合会主席罗伯茨请代表们注意，外国在纺织业方面的竞争使英国纺织业的失业人数不断增加。年会通过了一项决议，要求政府采取必要的措施“整顿局面。”
    许多代表在发言中谈到了一个极其迫切的问题——团结工人运动的队伍和巩固世界和平的问题。某些发言人在这方面严厉批评社会党国际。例如，议员戴维斯说，“他经常怀疑社会党国际是否真正主张和平解决国际问题。”华生代表执行委员会回答说，社会党国际的决定并不是工党必须执行的。
    年会没有讨论议程上的许多重要的问题，因为执行委员会坚持延期讨论这些问题，说是“时间不够”。这些问题中有对党章的某些修改（其中极其重要的一个修改就是加强党的地方组织在执行委员会中的代表权），此外还有工业国有化问题、失业问题、教育问题、保健问题等等。
    据新华社7日讯　塔斯社伦敦讯：英国共产党总书记高兰10月6日在“工人日报”上评论这次工党年会的结果时写道：“在布莱克浦所表现的情绪如果能化为具体的政策和行动的话，它将会使劳工运动发生转变。”但是，高兰指出，工党年会没有充分了解到在“新的战斗性政策”的基础上把包括共产党在内的全体劳动人民团结起来的必要性。高兰要求工党的普通党员争取英国劳动人民的行动一致，共同努力来保卫自己的利益。
    高兰最后写道：“工党年会是向前迈进了一大步，它说明右翼的统治再也不能遏制工人运动的发展了。我们要求继续前进，战胜反对整个工人运动团结一致的势力。”
