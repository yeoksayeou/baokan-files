Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 25th: A motorboat dispatched by the Tianjin Inland Navigation Bureau to Wuliangsuhai in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region recently began towing fishing boats for the first time from the Wuqia River to Wuliangsuhai in the Hetao area of Inner Mongolia.

It is now the peak fishing season in Wuliangsuhai. On average, more than 70,000 jin of fresh carp are transported daily by this motorboat and wooden boats to the Anbei Aquatic Products Company, and then transferred to cities such as Baotou, Hohhot, Datong, Taiyuan, and Beijing for people to eat.

The motorboat can tow 15,000 to 20,000 jin of fresh fish at a time, and it only takes six hours for a round trip, compared to three days for a wooden boat. The freight is also lower than that of a wooden boat. Because of its speed and large carrying capacity, the quality of the fish is guaranteed.

    内蒙古鲜鱼大批运往各地
    据新华社呼和浩特25日电　天津内河航运局派往内蒙古自治区乌梁素海的一艘内燃机汽艇，最近第一次在内蒙古河套地区的乌加河到乌梁素海开始拖运渔船。
    现在正是乌梁素海捕鱼旺季，平均每天有七万多斤的新鲜鲤鱼通过这艘汽艇和木船运往安北水产公司，然后转运到包头、呼和浩特、大同、太原和北京等城市供给人们食用。
    内燃机汽艇一次可拖运一万五千至两万斤的鲜鱼，来回只需六小时就可走完木船三天的路程，运费也比木船要低。由于它速度快、载重量多，因而保障了鱼的质量。
