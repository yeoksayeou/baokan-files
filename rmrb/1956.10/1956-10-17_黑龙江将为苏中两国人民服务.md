Heilongjiang Will Serve the People of the Soviet Union and China
Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences
Deputy Chairman of the Productivity Research Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Pustovalov

    The agreement between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China on the joint investigation and comprehensive utilization of the natural resources of the Heilongjiang River Basin was signed in Beijing not long ago.

    The Heilongjiang River is one of the largest rivers in the world. The Heilongjiang River, together with the Shilka and Onon rivers (both of which are within Soviet territory - translator's note) that form it, is 4,354 kilometers long. The length of the Heilongjiang River ranks eighth in the world. The area of the Heilongjiang River Basin is 1,843,000 square kilometers, ranking tenth in the world, almost equal to a quarter of the entire territory of the United States and more than thirteen times the territory of Great Britain. The Heilongjiang River and its tributary, the Ergun River, form the border between the Soviet Union and China for approximately 2,000 kilometers.

    Due to frequent heavy rains, the powerful Heilongjiang River and its tributaries, which are still largely undeveloped, often cause devastating floods. The frequent and severe floods have caused great losses to the national economies of the Soviet Union and China.

    However, the natural conditions of the Heilongjiang River and its tributaries make it possible to restrain the powerful forces that currently cause great damage to agriculture and industry, and to turn these forces to serve the people of the Soviet Union and China.

    Existing preliminary materials indicate that it is possible to build a system of dams along the Ergun River and the Heilongjiang River, which form the border between the two countries, as well as other major rivers in the Heilongjiang River Basin, so that the Soviet Union and China will no longer suffer huge losses due to frequent floods here. The construction of dams would also make it possible to establish a powerful network of hydroelectric power stations to supply very cheap electricity.

    Since the Ergun River and the Heilongjiang River are rivers flowing through the borders of the two countries, it is natural that China and the Soviet Union should work together to investigate and develop them, and that the electricity obtained from these rivers should be appropriately distributed between the two countries.

    The discovery of powerful sources of electricity in the Heilongjiang River Basin will undoubtedly bring about a fundamental change in this vast and rich border region.

    The construction of dams will make it possible to carry out extensive land improvement on a large amount of fertile wasteland in the Heilongjiang River Basin in both China and the Soviet Union, where the soil is currently unusable for agriculture due to excessive moisture and flooding. This will greatly expand and improve the sown area in eastern Soviet Union and northeast China. With cheap electricity, it will be possible to establish modern, progressive, electrified, and mechanized agriculture with stable harvests on both the Chinese and Soviet territories along the Heilongjiang River.

    According to the existing materials, which need to be supplemented and confirmed, there are very rich deposits of various mineral raw materials in the Heilongjiang River Basin, both within the Soviet Union and within China. There are many mineral deposits distributed here, including various non-ferrous metals, ores, ferrous metal ores, coal, valuable chemical raw materials, and building stone. This, coupled with powerful sources of electricity, will create particularly favorable conditions for turning the Heilongjiang River region of China and the Soviet Union into a developed industrial area with mining, metallurgy, chemicals, construction, and other industries.

    Adjusting the flow and level of the Heilongjiang River with the help of a dam network with power stations will fundamentally transform and improve the navigation of this major river in the Far East and turn the Heilongjiang River, a border river, into a first-class international waterway.

    It should be pointed out that below the point where the Songhua River flows into the Heilongjiang River, the Heilongjiang River suddenly turns north and flows into the northern part of the Tatar Strait, located between the east coast of the Asian continent and Sakhalin Island, near Nikolayevsk-on-Amur in the Soviet Union. From a shipping point of view, the geographical location of the mouth of the Heilongjiang River is unfavorable, because the goods transported along the Heilongjiang River are mainly supplied not to the cold, sparsely populated northern regions of the Soviet Union, but to the more populous and habitable regions of the Soviet Union and China south of the mouth of the Heilongjiang River.

    Therefore, a very realistic issue is raised, namely, changing the direction of the lower reaches of the Heilongjiang River and transporting the water of the Heilongjiang River to more southern regions - to settlements south of the Tatar Strait, to Peter the Great Bay in the Vladivostok area, and even to the Yellow Sea in the Liaodong Bay area. All this and all other possible plans (the realization of any of which will greatly increase the transport role of the Heilongjiang River) must be carefully studied from a technical and economic point of view.

    Speaking of the Heilongjiang River, one cannot fail to mention its fishery resources. In terms of the diversity of fish species (about 100 species), the Heilongjiang River is one of the richest in the world. The construction of a dam network on the Heilongjiang River and its major tributaries will greatly change the river conditions, and thus the living, breeding, and distribution of fish will also change greatly. These changes must be studied and identified so that the industrial development of the Heilongjiang River Basin not only does not bring losses to the fishery in this area, but also makes it possible to further develop it as much as possible.

    Naturally, the study of various natural resources and the comprehensive industrial development of the Heilongjiang River Basin cannot be realized quickly. This complex undertaking requires a certain period of time, but we should shorten this period as much as possible.

    According to the agreement signed between the Soviet Union and China, the Sino-Soviet comprehensive Heilongjiang River water conservancy survey team has already begun its survey work in the Heilongjiang River Basin this summer. They have set out to systematically and purposefully study the natural conditions, water resources, geological conditions and minerals, transportation conditions, and other characteristics of the Heilongjiang River Basin.

    Both the Soviet Union and China have equal interests in studying and developing the natural resources of the Heilongjiang River Basin and turning the Heilongjiang River Basin into a developed agricultural and industrial region.

    The agreement signed between the governments of the Soviet Union and China on the joint investigation and comprehensive utilization of the natural resources of the Heilongjiang River Basin is a new manifestation of the fraternal friendship and unity of interests of the two great neighboring countries.

    There is no doubt that, thanks to the joint efforts of Chinese and Soviet experts, the powerful, crude, and temporarily untamed forces of the Heilongjiang River will be tamed in the near future and serve the common interests of the Chinese and Soviet peoples.

    黑龙江将为苏中两国人民服务
    苏联科学院通讯院士
    苏联科学院生产力研究委员会副主席  普斯托瓦洛夫
    苏联和中华人民共和国共同调查并综合利用黑龙江流域自然资源的协定，不久以前在北京签字了。
    黑龙江是世界上最大的河流之一。黑龙江连同形成黑龙江的石勒喀河和鄂嫩河（这两条河流都在苏联境内——译者注）全长四千三百五十四公里。黑龙江的长度占世界第八位。黑龙江流域的面积是一百八十四万三千平方公里，占世界第十位，差不多等于美国全部领土的四分之一，超过英国领土的十三倍。黑龙江及其支流额尔古纳河有约两千公里的长度是苏中两国的国境。
    由于经常下大雨，这个暂时还很少开发的强大的黑龙江及其支流常常泛滥成灾。由于经常发生惨重的水灾，苏联和中国的国民经济遭受了很大的损失。
    但是，黑龙江及其支流的自然条件，却有可能制止住目前带给农业和工业以极大损失的强大的力量，而把这些力量转而为苏中两国人民服务。
    现有的初步材料表明，沿两国国境的额尔古纳河和黑龙江以及黑龙江流域的其他大河能够建筑堤坝系统，使苏联和中国不再因为这里经常闹水灾而遭受巨大的损失。建筑堤坝同时就有可能建立强大的水力发电站网，供给非常便宜的电力。
    额尔古纳河和黑龙江既然是流经两国国境的河流，那末自然应当由中国和苏联共同努力来进行考察和开发，而从这些河流上获得的电力也应当在两个国家间适当地分配。
    黑龙江流域强大的电力源泉的发现无疑地将使这个辽阔、富庶的边疆地区发生根本的改变。
    建筑堤坝就能在中苏两国黑龙江流域内的大量肥沃生荒地上广泛进行土地改良，目前土壤由于过湿和充满了水而在农业上不能利用。这将大大扩大和改善苏联东部地区和中国东北的播种面积。有了便宜的电力就能在黑龙江两岸中国和苏联的领土上建立有稳定丰收的现代进步的电气化和机械化的农业。
    根据现有的这些需要继续补充和确定的材料，在黑龙江流域，不论在苏联境内或中国境内，都有着非常丰富的各种矿物原料。这里分布着许许多多的矿产地，有各种有色金属、矿石、黑色金属矿石、煤炭、有价值的化学原料和建筑石料等矿藏。这同强大的电力源泉相配合，就能为把中苏两国黑龙江沿岸地区变成一个有采矿、冶金、化学、建筑等各种发达的工业区域创造特别有利的条件。
    借助于有发电站的堤坝网来调整黑龙江的流水和水平将有可能根本改造和改善远东这一大河的航业，将有可能把黑龙江这个国境河流变成头等的国际运输水道。
    不能不指出，在松花江流入黑龙江的入口处以下，黑龙江突然向北转，在苏联的庙街附近流入位于亚洲大陆东岸和库页岛之间的鞑靼海峡的北部。从航运的观点说来，黑龙江江口的地理位置是不利的，因为沿黑龙江运输的货物主要不是供给气候严寒、居民较少的苏联北部地区，而是供给黑龙江江口以南的苏联和中国的居民较多和更适于居住的地区之用。
    因此，就提出一项非常现实的问题，即改变黑龙江下游的方向，并且把黑龙江的水输送到更南方的地区去——输送到鞑靼海峡以南的各居民点，输送到海参崴地区的大彼得湾，甚至输送到辽东湾地区的黄海。这一切和其他一切可能的方案（实现其中任何一项都将大大提高黑龙江的运输作用）都必须从技术观点和经济观点加以仔细研究。
    说到黑龙江不能不提到它的渔业资源。按照鱼的种类的繁多（约有一百种）来说，黑龙江是世界上最多的中间的一个。在黑龙江和它的大支流上建筑堤坝网将使河流状况大大改变，因而鱼类的生活、繁殖和分布的情况也要大大改变。这些改变必须加以研究并且查明，以便使黑龙江流域的工业开发不仅不给这一地区的渔业带来损失，而且要尽可能地使其进一步发展。
    自然，黑龙江流域各种自然资源的研究和工业的综合开发不能很快地实现。这项复杂的事业需要一定的期限，但是，我们应当尽可能地缩短这个期限。
    根据苏联和中国签订的协定，中苏综合利用黑龙江水利考察队已经在今年夏天在黑龙江流域开始了考察工作。他们着手系统地和有计划地研究黑龙江流域的自然条件、水力资源、地质情况和矿产、运输条件和其他特点。
    研究和开发黑龙江流域的自然资源并把黑龙江流域变成发达的农业和工业区域，不论苏联或中国都是有平等的利益的。
    苏中两国政府签订的共同调查并综合利用黑龙江流域自然资源的协定是两个伟大邻国的兄弟般友谊和利益一致的新的表现。
    毫无疑问，由于中苏两国专家的共同努力，黑龙江的强大的、粗野的、暂时还没被驯服的力量在不久的将来就要被驯服和为中苏两国人民的共同利益而服务。
