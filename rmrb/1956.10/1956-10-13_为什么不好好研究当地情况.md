    Why Not Seriously Study Local Conditions

    Promoting science, technology, and advanced experiences is naturally a good thing. However, if it's not adapted to local conditions, it can also turn into a bad thing. Not long ago, I saw many instances of mechanically applying dogma in the Niezhai area of Xingyang County, Henan Province, which caused losses in production. The cadres leading agricultural production there didn't deeply study the local natural conditions, nor did they go to the fields to see how the crops were growing. They just subjectively and commandingly ordered the agricultural cooperative cadres and members to follow the methods they specified. Did the cooperative cadres and members have any opinions about this? Yes, they did. I contacted many cooperative cadres and masses, and they had many opinions. The cooperative cadres said: If you raised an opinion at that time, the county committee work team comrades would label you as "right-leaning" or "conservative"; therefore, they didn't dare to raise any opinions.

    Subjective practices have already caused the following adverse consequences in production:

    ①It is now certain that cotton production will decrease this year. The main reason for the decrease, according to the cooperative cadres and members, is that the methods of the technology promotion station comrades are problematic. They didn't go to the fields to carefully observe the cotton growth, nor did they ask the masses about the past cotton growth situation in the area. They simply forbade the members from topping the plants. What was the result? The cotton plants kept growing upwards, and many of the lower buds fell off. Until now, each cotton plant has very few cotton bolls. The local soil is inherently poor, and cotton plants don't grow very tall. They need to be topped at a certain time, otherwise, the cotton bolls will fall off in large numbers. This is the experience of local farmers for many years, and it is actually in line with scientific principles. The technology promotion station comrades didn't allow timely topping, and I don't know what science they based this on.

    ②Corn production will also decrease. The reason for the decrease is the blind promotion of dense planting and intercropping. The soil there is poor; it is all dry land, and most of the land is only fertilized with grass manure. In this situation, if the spacing between plants is too close, the corn will indeed not grow well. What is this "intercropping"? In the current cornfields, in addition to corn, they are also full of mung beans, soybeans, and sesame. In some fields, you can't even see the soil. Fertilizer is limited, and the land only has a certain amount of strength. If this grows, that won't. It's indeed beneficial to plant some beans in the cornfield appropriately, but it's not good to plant too many and too mixed.

    It is said that the county has ordered that this year's wheat should be sown horizontally once and then vertically once, forming a very dense grid shape. The cooperative cadres disagree with this method of planting. I also think this may not be good and that we should first conduct experiments on a small area to see what the results are before rushing to promote it on a large scale.

    This summer, a lot of wheat rotted. Of course, the main reason was the excessive rain. However, there were also man-made disasters. Just as the wheat harvest was about to begin, the county committee's rural work team wanted people to dig wells. Many male laborers and some strong female laborers were digging wells, which hindered the wheat harvest to some extent. In cooperatives with serious wheat rotting, more than 30% of the wheat rotted.

    This county has dug a lot of wells this year, which is a good thing. However, in some places that are not suitable for digging wells, many were also dug. For example, in Nanzhou Village Township, many wells were dug, costing a lot of manpower and material resources, and several people were also crushed to death or injured; however, only a few of them yielded water. The reason is that the groundwater level is too low, and you have to dig seventeen or eighteen fathoms deep to get water. Even if such deep wells are dug, how can the land be irrigated? This is still a problem. The cooperative members and cooperative cadres also have many opinions on this matter.
                                                                                        Wu Yin

### 为什么不好好研究当地情况

    为什么不好好研究当地情况
    推广科学技术和先进经验，自然是好事情。但是，如果不因地制宜，也会办成坏事情。不久以前，我在河南省荥阳县聂寨一带看到了不少生搬硬套教条，使生产遭受损失的事情。在当地领导农业生产的干部并没有深入地研究当地的自然条件，也没有去地里看一下庄稼生长的情况，只是主观主义地命令式地要农业社干部和社员按照他们指定的办法去做。这样作，社干部和社员群众是不是有意见呢？有。我接触了不少社干部和群众，他们都有很多意见。社干部说：当时你如果提意见，县委工作组的同志会给你戴“右倾”“保守”的帽子；因此，有意见也不敢提。
    主观主义的做法，在生产上已经造成这样一些恶果：
    ①今年棉花要减产是可以肯定的了。减产的主要原因，据社干部和社员说，主要是技术推广站的同志们的作法有问题。他们没有去地里很好地看看棉花的生长情况，也没有向群众问问当地过去棉花的生长情况，就不让社员打顶。结果是怎样呢，棉花一直往上长，下边的很多花蕾都掉了。到现在，每株棉花的棉桃没有几个。当地的土质本来就不好，棉株是长不太高的，到一定时候就要打顶，不然棉桃就会大部落掉；这是当地农民多年的经验了，实际上是合乎科学道理的。技术推广站的同志不让适时地打顶尖，不知道究竟根据的是什么科学？
    ②玉米也要减产。减产的原因，是盲目地推行密植和混作。那里的土质是不好的，都是旱地，绝大部分土地只上一些草粪。在这情况下，如果株距太近，玉米的确长不好。“混作”是什么呢？现在的玉米地里，除了玉米以外，还种满了绿豆、黄豆、芝麻，有的地简直看不见地皮了。肥料有限，地只有一定的力量，长这是不长那的。玉米地里适当地种些豆子的确有好处，种得太多太杂了就不好了。
    据说，县里布置，今年的麦子要横播一下再竖播一下，种成很密的网形的格子。社干部不同意这样种。我也认为这样不一定好，应该先在小面积上试验试验，看看究竟如何，不可急于大面积推广。
    今年夏天，麦子霉烂了很多。当然，主要原因是下雨多。可是，其中也有人为的灾害。在正要开始收麦的时候，县委驻乡工作组要叫打井。有很多男劳力和一些强的女劳力都打井，在一定程度上妨碍收麦。麦子霉烂情况严重的社，霉烂的在30％以上。
    今年这个县打了不少的井，这是很好的。但是，有的地方不适于打井，却也打了不少。如：南周村乡打了很多井，费了不少人力物力，还砸死砸伤了几个人；可是，打出水来的只有少数几个。原因是地下水位太低，要打十七、八丈深才出水。这样深的井，即使打成了，怎样浇地呢？也还是个问题。社员群众和社干部对这件事的意见也很多。　五银
