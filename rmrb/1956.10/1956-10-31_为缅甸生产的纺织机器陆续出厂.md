Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 29th. One of the five types of textile machines manufactured by Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory for Burma—the high-speed warping machine—was officially manufactured in late October. This is the latest warping machine designed successfully by Chinese technicians with reference to advanced technologies at home and abroad. Its efficiency is four to six times higher than that of ordinary warping machines.

	This machine can arrange the spun cotton yarn into warp yarn for weaving cloth. The machine has a very precise structure and is equipped with an electrically controlled yarn-break auto-stop device. As long as one cotton yarn breaks, the machine will stop running in less than one-tenth of a second, which can save workers time in finding the broken end. The machine also has an electrical length-setting auto-stop device, which automatically stops the machine when the cotton yarn is arranged to the required length.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 30th. The textile machines manufactured by Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory for Burma have been leaving the factory one after another. The textile machines manufactured by this factory for Burma include eleven kinds of products such as cotton cleaners, sizing machines, and drum-type winders, totaling nearly fifty machines. According to Burma's geographical climate and cotton conditions, the workers creatively improved the original machine design in more than one hundred places so that it can work as usual in Burma's humid temperature. In addition, this batch of machines is also equipped with good protective equipment to ensure the safety of Burmese workers.

	This newspaper reports: Two 35 kV high-voltage oil switches and six 35 kV high-voltage isolating switches produced by our country for Burma will be shipped to Burma at the end of November. This is the first time that our country has produced high-voltage switches for tropical countries. Burma has a humid and rainy climate, and the insulation and anti-rust performance of the switches are particularly high. In order to ensure quality, this batch of switches is manufactured under the personal guidance of the experienced Deputy Chief Engineer of Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory. At present, relevant workshops are carrying out special treatment and packaging work on the insulation and anti-corrosion performance of the switches. This batch of switches is not only beautiful, but also of good quality.

    为缅甸生产的纺织机器陆续出厂
    新华社天津29日电　天津纺织机械厂为缅甸制造的五种纺织机器之一——高速整经机，10月下旬已经正式制造出来。这是我国技术人员参考国内外先进技术设计成功的最新的整经机，它的效率比普通的整经机高四倍到六倍。
    这种机器可以把纺好的棉纱整理成为经纱，供织布用。机器的构造很精密，并且有电气控制的断头自停装置，只要有一根棉纱断了，机器在不到十分之一秒钟的时间内就停止运转，可以节省工人找断头的时间。机器上还有电气定长自停装置，当棉纱被整理到需要的长度时，机器就自动地停下来。
    据新华社郑州30日电　郑州纺织机械厂为缅甸制造的纺织机器已经陆续出厂。这个厂为缅甸制造的纺织机器有清棉机、浆纱机和槽筒式络筒机等十一种产品，将近五十部机器。职工们根据缅甸的地理气候和棉花条件，创造性的将原来的机器设计改进了一百多处，使它在缅甸潮湿的气温下能够照常工作。此外，这批机器还安装了很好的防护设备，保证缅甸工人操作安全。
    本报讯　我国为缅甸生产的两台35千伏高压油开关和六台35千伏高压隔离开关，将在11月底运住缅甸。我国为热带国家生产高压开关还是第一次。缅甸气候潮湿多雨，对开关的绝缘、防锈性能要求特别高，为了保证质量，这批开关是由沈阳高压开关厂经验丰富的副总工程师亲自指导制造的。目前，有关车间正对开关的绝缘、防腐性能进行特殊处理和包装工作。这批开关不仅美观好看，而且质量良好。
