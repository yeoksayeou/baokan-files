Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd - According to a report from the Yugoslav News Agency: Yugoslav President Tito pointed out at a luncheon on October 21st to entertain the Romanian government and Workers' Party delegation that almost everything stipulated in the joint statement of the Romanian and Yugoslav governments signed in Bucharest in the past few months has already been realized or is prepared to be realized in the near future.

Tito told the Romanian delegation: "We are deeply convinced that your visit and the upcoming talks will help to expand existing relations and further consolidate sincere friendship and comprehensive cooperation. I would like to especially emphasize that Yugoslavia will certainly make every effort in the future to help promote cooperation between our two countries in political, economic, cultural and other fields."

In his speech, Tito also pointed out that the people of Romania and Yugoslavia have historically been linked by the same destiny and struggle in their path to achieving national independence. Today, they are linked by the struggle to build a better future and the common desire to strengthen world peace. The people of both countries realize that in order to achieve this goal, there must be good-neighborly and friendly cooperation. "The development of our two countries' relations to date convinces us that these efforts are also a constant concern of the Romanian government."

The head of the Romanian government and Workers' Party delegation, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, also spoke at the luncheon. He pointed out that a large part of the issues stipulated in the joint statement of the two governments has been resolved in a short period of time. A long-term trade agreement between the two countries will be signed soon. He also said that there are favorable conditions for expanding cultural relations between Yugoslavia and Romania. "All of this convincingly demonstrates the durability of the friendly relations that have been established between our two countries and our two peoples."

Gheorghiu-Dej emphasized that our two countries have the same views on major international political issues. They are firmly linked by a common desire, which is to promote peaceful relations between countries, strengthen international trust, and strengthen economic and cultural exchanges on the basis of equality and mutual benefit without imposing political conditions.

Gheorghiu-Dej then expressed his belief that strengthening the ties between the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Romanian Workers' Party, extensively exchanging views and experiences in socialist construction, and exchanging views and experiences on issues of the international workers' movement and the struggle for peace are in the interests of the two peoples. He believes that this visit will be a new and significant contribution to consolidating the friendship between the two countries.

Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd - According to a report from the Yugoslav News Agency, the Belgrade City People's Committee held a meeting on the morning of the 21st to welcome the Romanian government and Workers' Party delegation.

The chairman of the Belgrade City People's Committee, Minic, delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting. He pointed out that the relations between Romania and Yugoslavia, especially after President Tito's visit to Bucharest, have developed in a direction favorable to both countries. He believes that the delegation's visit to Yugoslavia will be a new impetus for the realization of the Romanian-Yugoslav Declaration signed in Bucharest, and a step towards consolidating the relations and friendly cooperation between the two countries.

Romanian Chairman of the Council of Ministers Stoica also spoke at the meeting. He said: Our visit to Yugoslavia and the exchange of views with the Yugoslav leaders will not only lead to the strengthening of relations between the two countries, but also promote their cooperation with all countries and peace-loving forces.

After the meeting, the Belgrade City People's Committee presented gifts to all members of the delegation.
