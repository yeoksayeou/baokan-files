    Learning from Comrade Lu Xun's Articles on Comic Strips
    Jiang Weipu
    Comrade Lu Xun attached great importance to and cared deeply about comic strips during his lifetime. His writings on comic strips include "A Defense of 'Serial Picture Books'," "Random Thoughts on Serial Picture Books," "On the 'Adoption of Old Forms'," "Preface to 'A Person's Suffering'," and "Reading and Recognizing Characters with Pictures," along with other articles and letters that mention and involve comic strips, totaling about a dozen. Although Comrade Lu Xun passed away twenty years ago, and both the social system and the people's lives have undergone fundamental changes, with comic strips transforming from "rotten junk" into new mass reading material, Comrade Lu Xun's articles still provide us with great inspiration and encouragement.
    I
    In his article "'Serial Picture Books' Defense," Comrade Lu Xun powerfully countered the reactionary bourgeois literati's attempt to dismiss comic strips with a single stroke. He stated that comic strips, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, "can not only become art but have already taken their place in the palace of art." He advised young people to value and strive for excellence in comic strips and illustrations as much as they would for large oil paintings or watercolors. Today, those who want to "dismiss comic strips with a single stroke" seem to no longer exist, and many people pay lip service to their importance. However, the idea that comic strips are merely a transitional tool for literacy is not uncommon, leading to the perception of creating, editing, and publishing comic strips as a dead-end, menial job, a "lowly pursuit." Some young art school graduates, after being assigned to work on "little books," felt so ashamed that they couldn't look their old classmates in the eye. Some writers, after writing comic strip scripts, were unwilling to sign their names, fearing ridicule from their peers.
    Of course, an author's creative interests cannot be forced, and paths of creative development vary. However, from the perspective of the people's needs and serving the revolutionary cause, clarifying tasks and establishing interests is the attitude that people's literary and art workers should have. Comrade Lu Xun's emphasis on comic strips, his advocacy, promotion, and guidance, stemmed not from personal preference but from a deep understanding of the needs of the masses. Comrade Lu Xun, in his article "The Popularization of Literature and Art" (collected in "Supplements to Collected Outside Works"), discussed the issue of serving the masses in detail: "There should be more writers who consider the masses, striving to create simple and easy-to-understand works, so that everyone can understand and enjoy them, in order to squeeze out some rotten junk." Today, is not using new comic strips to squeeze out reactionary, absurd, and obscene books still a serious struggle? Comrade Lu Xun saw the importance of this struggle at the time and resolutely plunged into it. On one hand, he used his sharp pen to repel various enemies, maintaining the vitality of comic strips; on the other hand, he vigorously cultivated and guided young authors of the time, so that comic strips could gain new vitality. At the same time, he also compiled and selected progressive foreign comic strip works, personally writing prefaces, introductions, and explanatory notes, and planning their printing and publication, to encourage and inspire the development of new comic strips. This spirit of Comrade Lu Xun is precisely what every comic strip worker and other literary and art worker should learn today.
    II
    Comrade Lu Xun especially emphasized that comic strips should enable the masses to "understand and enjoy them," and "should be understandable to people who have no training in art appreciation, and be clear at a glance." "For the sake of the masses, striving for ease of understanding is precisely the correct effort of progressive artists." Precisely because of this consideration for the masses, Comrade Lu Xun earnestly advised young writers to not only study Western masterpieces but also to "pay more attention to the embroidered images and picture books in old Chinese books, as well as the single-sheet New Year's prints." (See "'Serial Picture Books' Defense") He used vivid and powerful satire to refute the argument that insisted on "realism" regardless of the masses' preferences and aesthetic habits.
    The reason why our comic strips today cannot completely "squeeze out" the reactionary, absurd, and obscene books left over from the old society is that, on the one hand, there are not enough varieties, and on the other hand, the new comic strips have failed to make the masses "understand and enjoy them," which is also an important reason. Opening up the current comic strips, one rarely sees lively and exciting stories. In adaptations, some original story details are largely "refined" away, leaving only a few bones or "theme-appropriate" frameworks, believing that this is the only way to reach the pinnacle of art. Dialogues on the screen are also generally regarded as a major enemy of "destroying artistic integrity," so they are desperately deleted or squeezed into explanatory texts. In this way, whether the art is complete is uncertain, but the readers call it a dumb book and strongly object. Of course, we should not overuse dialogues and symbols on the screen, attempting to replace artistic images with symbols and words to "condescend" to the masses, which is not our direction. However, the "kicking away" method that disregards the masses is a more important issue at present. Especially in recent years, some authors have been struggling to improve quickly, believing that national forms have restricted them and must be "broken through." Where to improve to? Western painting methods are considered the only way. Therefore, some authors easily abandon the familiar expression methods they have mastered for the masses, change their appearance, and are determined to move towards "improvement," while whether the works are "understandable and enjoyable" to the masses seems to become secondary.
    Of course, we should not oppose new attempts at creation, should not randomly label everything as "separation from the masses," nor should we think that "the more vulgar, the better." Comrade Lu Xun also said in his article "The Popularization of Literature and Art": "If literature and art try to condescend, it is easy to degenerate into catering to the masses and pleasing the masses. Catering and pleasing will not benefit the masses." Therefore, we must start from the general masses' level of acceptance and the basis of what the masses like, to improve and elevate. Comrade Lu Xun also explained this issue in detail in his article: "Why are old forms only 'adopted'? ... It is for the exploration of new forms." "These adoptions are not a jumble of fragmentary antiques, but must be dissolved into new works." "Just like eating cattle and sheep, discarding the hooves and hair, retaining their essence, to nourish and develop new bodies, and will never therefore 'resemble' cattle and sheep." (See "On the 'Adoption of Old Forms'") Comrade Lu Xun's view is consistent with Chairman Mao's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new." However, in creative practice, it is often believed that emphasizing national forms and folk styles will narrow the path of comic strips and restrict the progress of art. In fact, only by improving on the basis of what the masses like, and absorbing foreign forms on the basis of inheriting and developing national forms, can we gain vigorous vitality and achieve a hundred flowers blooming.
    III
    Comrade Lu Xun's articles rarely discuss the issue of comic strip script writing, which may be because comic strip scripts were not given such importance as they are today. However, Comrade Lu Xun's views on comic strips and his spirit of considering the broad masses also provide great inspiration for today's comic strip script writing.
    Comrade Lu Xun, in his article "About Serial Picture Books" (collected in "Supplements to the Complete Works of Lu Xun"), said when talking about subject matter and writing: "The characters are characters known to the masses, but the events may be changed. Old novels are fine, for example, the Legend of the White Snake (also known as the Righteous Demon Tale) is very good, but some places need to be added (such as the courage to never give up), and some places need to be weakened (such as repaying private favors and flooding Jinshan for one's own sake, etc.)." This principle is precisely what we should pay attention to today. In today's script writing, generally speaking, there is little concern about weakening, but adding is fraught with difficulties; as for the method of transplanting as is, it is regarded as a simple, reliable, and risk-free shortcut. All folk tales and ancient legends, regardless of their quality, are regarded as flawless jade, and rarely are they refined or processed according to the characteristics of comic strips. This has caused the stagnation and stagnation of the content of comic strip themes, and everything is the same.
    The writing style of stuffing "class essence" and adding slogans into comic strips with a vulgar sociological view does exist; the abuses of arbitrarily tampering with and distorting the original works have not been eradicated. However, what we need is positive improvement. Choking on food and abandoning food altogether, and throwing out the baby with the bathwater, is even more undesirable. We should encourage independent creation, or bold and serious processing in adaptation. As long as it is done beneficially, or the benefits outweigh the disadvantages, it will be as Comrade Lu Xun said: "The masses want to see it, and the masses are grateful!" (Concluding remarks of the article "'Serial Picture Books' Defense") Comrade Lu Xun once predicted that comic strips could produce painters like Michelangelo and Vinci, so can comic strip scripts with literary characteristics not produce Tolstoys and Flauberts, just like the songbooks and storytelling that he predicted!
    Due to the victory of the revolution, the comic strip industry that Comrade Lu Xun cared about during his lifetime, like other literature and art, has gained a broad path of development. Those engaged in comic strip work today will not encounter the many difficulties that Lu Xun faced at the time. We should work harder to shoulder this task and allow the comic strip industry to play a greater role in the socialist cause.

    学习鲁迅先生论连环画的文章的体会
    姜维朴
    鲁迅先生生前非常重视和关怀连环画，他所写的论述连环画的文章有“‘连环图画’辩护”、“连环图画琐谈”、“论‘旧形式的采用’”、“‘一个人的受难’序”、“看图识字”等，加上其它提到和涉及连环画的文章、书简，共约有十余种。虽然鲁迅先生逝世二十周年了，社会制度和人民生活都发生了根本的变化，连环画也从“陈腐的劳什子”变成了新的群众读物，但是鲁迅先生这些文章，仍能给我们很大的启示和鼓励。一
    鲁迅先生在“‘连环图画’辩护”一文中，有力地打击了企图把连环画一笔抹杀的资产阶级反动文人的论调，他说：连环画在古今中外“不但可以成为艺术，而且已经坐在艺术之宫里了。”他劝导青年像对大幅油画或水彩画一样看重并努力于连环画和插图。今天，对连环画要“一笔抹杀”的人似乎不存在了，不少人在口头上也颇为重视，但是把连环画看作仅是过渡时期的扫盲工具等等思想，还不是个别的，以致把连环画的创作和编辑出版工作看作是没有前途的苦差使，是“下等物事”。有些美术学校毕业的青年，被分配到作“小人书”以后，羞愧得见了老同学无颜抬头。有的作家编了连环画脚本，不愿署名，生怕因此被同行耻笑。
    当然，对一个作者的创作志趣不能强求如何，创作发展的途径也各有不同。但是，如果从人民的需要、从为革命事业服务的角度设想，从而明确任务，建立志趣，是人民文艺工作者应有的态度。鲁迅先生所以这样重视连环画，这样加以维护、提倡和指导，不是出于个人偏爱，而是深深体会到了群众的需要。鲁迅先生在“文艺的大众化”一文（收“集外集拾遗”中）详尽地谈到为群众服务的问题，“应该多有为大众设想的作家，竭力来作浅显易解的作品，使大家能懂、爱看，以挤掉一些陈腐的劳什子。”今天，以新的连环画来挤掉反动、荒诞、淫秽的图书，不仍然是一场严重的斗争吗？鲁迅先生在当时就看到这一斗争的重要，并坚决地投进斗争中。他一面用犀利的笔锋杀退各色敌人，维护了连环画的生机，一面竭力培养和指导当时的青年作者，以使连环画获得新的生命力，同时他还编选外国进步连环画作品，亲自写序目和说明文，筹划印制出版，用以鼓励和启发新连环画的发展。鲁迅先生这种精神，正是我们今天每一个连环画工作者和其他文艺工作者应该学习的。二
    鲁迅先生特别注意连环画要使群众“能懂、爱看”，“是要毫无观赏艺术的训练的人，也看得懂，而且一目了然。”“为了大众，力求易懂，也正是前进的艺术家正确的努力。”正是这样为群众着想，鲁迅先生谆谆告诫青年作家，不仅要研究西洋的名作，而且要“更应注意于中国旧书上的绣像和画本，以及新年的单张的花纸。”（见“‘连环图画’辩护”）他以生动有力的讽喻，来驳斥那种硬要“真实”而不顾群众喜爱与欣赏习惯的论点。
    我们今天的连环画，所以还不能完全“挤掉”旧社会遗留下来的反动、荒诞、淫秽的图书，一方面是品种不足，同时新连环画未使群众“能懂、爱看”，也是重要原因。翻开现在的连环画，很少看到生动热闹的故事，在改编时有的把原著故事细节大量地“精炼”掉，而剩下来的是几根骸骨或“合乎主题”的框框，以为这样才能达到艺术的高峰。画面上的对话也一概被视为“破坏艺术完整”的大敌，于是拼命删除，或挤到说明文中，这样一来，艺术是否完整了，倒不一定，但读者却把它叫作哑吧书，纷纷提出反对。当然，我们不应在画面上滥用对话和符号，企图以符号和文字来代替艺术形象的“俯就”群众的作法，并不是我们的方向。但是那种不顾群众的“一脚踢开”的办法，却是当前更为重要的问题。尤其近几年来有些作者苦于不能很快提高，认为民族形式束缚了自己，非“突破”不可，提高到哪里去呢？西洋画法则被认为唯一的途径。于是，有些作者轻易舍弃了自己掌握到的为群众熟悉的表现方法，改头换面，决心走向“提高”，而作品是否为群众“能懂、爱看”，就似乎成为次要了。
    当然，我们不应反对创作上的新的尝试，不应把“脱离群众”的帽子到处乱扣，也不应认为“越俗、就越好”。鲁迅先生在“文艺的大众化”一文中也曾这样说过：“若文艺设法俯就，就很容易流为迎合大众，媚悦大众。迎合和媚悦，是不会于大众有益的。”因此，就必须从一般群众的接受水平和群众喜爱的基础上出发，来改进和提高。这一问题，鲁迅先生在他的文章中也有详尽的阐明：“旧形式为什么只是‘采用’……就是为了新形式的探求。”“这些采取，并非断片的古董的杂陈，必须溶化于新作品中。”“恰如吃用牛羊，弃去蹄毛，留其精粹，以滋养及发达新的生体，决不因此就会‘类乎’牛羊的。”（见“论‘旧形式的采用’”）鲁迅先生这种见解与毛主席的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针是一致的。但是，在创作实践中，却往往认为强调民族形式、民间风格，就是使连环画道路狭窄化，使艺术的前进受到约束了。事实上，只有立脚在群众喜爱的基础上的提高，在继承和发扬民族形式的基础上吸收外国形式，才会获得茁壮的生命力，才能达到百花齐放。三
    鲁迅先生这些文章中较少谈到连环画脚本编写问题，这可能是由于当时连环画脚本还没有像今天这样被提到重要的地位。但鲁迅先生对连环画的论点，他的为广大群众设想的精神，同样对今天连环画脚本的编写有很大启示。
    鲁迅先生在“关于连环图画”（收在“鲁迅全集补遗”）一文中，谈到取材和编写时说：“人物是大众知道的人物，但事迹却不妨有所更改，旧小说也好，例如白蛇传（一名义妖传）就很好，但有些地方须加增（如百折不回之勇气），有些地方须削弱（如报私恩及为自己而水满金山等）。”这一原则正是我们今天所应重视的。在今天我们的脚本编写上，一般说来，对削弱是顾忌很少，而增加却碍难重重；至于照样移植的办法，更被视为简便可靠、不遭风险的捷径。凡是民间故事，古代传说，不论优劣精粗，都作为无瑕的白璧，很少再加以提炼和根据连环画特点进行加工。这样，造成了连环画题材内容的停滞淤塞，千篇一律。
    以庸俗社会学的观点，硬在连环画中塞进“阶级本质”、加上标语口号的编写作风，的确是存在的；那种对原著乱加窜改和任意歪曲的流弊也并未根除。但是，我们需要的是积极的改进，因噎废食和把脏水同婴儿一块倒掉，却是更要不得的。我们应该鼓励独立的创作，或是改编上大胆严肃的加工，只要做得有益，或利多弊少，也会如鲁迅先生所说：“大众是要看的，大众是感激的！”（“‘连环图画’辩护”一文的结束语）鲁迅先生曾预言连环画可以产出米开朗基罗、芬奇那样的画手，那么，作为具有文学特点的连环画脚本，不是也可以与他所预言的唱本说书一样可以产出托尔斯泰、弗罗培尔吗！
    由于革命的胜利，鲁迅先生生前所关怀的连环画事业，同其他文艺一样，获得了广阔的发展道路。今天从事连环画工作的人，决不会遇到如鲁迅当时所面临的重重困难，我们应当更努力地负起这一任务，让连环画事业在社会主义事业中发挥更大的作用。
