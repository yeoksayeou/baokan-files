    Strange "Photography System"
    Yú Qí
    Last month, a comrade and I went to a photography cooperative in the Jianxi District of Luoyang City to take a photo.
    He was being transferred and wanted to keep a photo as a memento.
      "How much does it cost to take a one-inch photo?" I asked.
      "Seven jiao and two fen."
      "What! Has the price gone up? Wasn't it six jiao before?"
      "No. Now, taking one photo gives you six photos."
      "I only need two."
      "No can do. This is a city-wide unified regulation. It's designed with the customer in mind."
      "But I only need two, won't the remaining four be a waste?"
      "We don't care about that. Anyway, we won't take the photo unless you take six. It's the system."
    Of course, I couldn't argue with him and had to take it. But I really can't figure out why Luoyang City would stipulate such a strange "photography system," and even call it "designed with the customer in mind."

    奇怪的“照相制度”
    禹奇
    上月我和一个同志到洛阳市涧西区一家照相合作社去照相。
    因为他要调走了，想留个影作纪念。
      “照一张一寸的相，要多少钱”？我问。
      “七角二分。”
      “怎么！涨价了？以前不是六角吗？”
      “不。现在照一张相，给六张相片。”
      “我只要两张就够了。”
      “不行。这是全市统一规定的。是为了顾客着想才这样规定的。”
      “可是我只要两张就够了，剩下的四张不是浪费了吗？”
      “这个我们不管。反正不要六张不给照，这是制度。”
    我当然拗不过他，只好照了。可是真想不透，洛阳市为什么规定这样一种奇怪的“照相制度”，还要美其名曰：“为了顾客着想。”
