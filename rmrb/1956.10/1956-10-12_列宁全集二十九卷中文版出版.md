Xinhua News Agency, 11th. The Chinese translation of "Lenin's Collected Works," Volume 29, has been published by the People's Publishing House and will be available in Xinhua bookstores in Beijing and throughout the country starting from the 12th.

    This volume includes Lenin's works from March to August 1919, most of which are reports and speeches at various conferences. These works fully reflect Lenin's outstanding activities in leading the newly founded socialist state, and clarify some of the most important issues in the policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet regime during this period, such as defending the socialist motherland, the attitude towards the middle peasants, and the struggle against economic difficulties.

    In the "Draft Program of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" and in the reports and speeches at the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Lenin summarized the rich experience of the Soviet state since its birth more than a year ago, expounded the basic tasks of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and put forward the party's specific program for the socialist struggle: to break the resistance of the bourgeoisie, manage and develop the national economy according to a unified socialist plan, absorb workers and working people to participate in state management, and systematically and gradually transform the small-peasant economy with socialist principles. In the "Report on Work in the Countryside," Lenin, based on the new situation, proposed a policy of moving from neutralizing the middle peasants to forming a solid alliance with them and maintaining the leadership of the proletariat in this alliance.

    The works on mobilizing the working class and working people to fight against Kolchak include: "Report on the Domestic and Foreign Situation of the Soviet Republic" at the extraordinary meeting of the Moscow Soviet, "Letter to the Workers of Petrograd in Support of the Eastern Front," "Outline of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the Situation on the Eastern Front," and "Struggle Against Kolchak," etc. In "To Workers and Peasants on Victory over Kolchak," Lenin explained the basic tasks related to strengthening the defense capabilities of the Soviet Republic derived from the experience of defeating Kolchak.

    In works such as "On the Current Situation and the Current Tasks of the Soviet Regime," "On the Domestic and Foreign Situation," and "On the Food Situation and the Military Situation," Lenin called for using all forces to fight against Denikin, while explaining the basic principles of the Soviet regime's food policy and stipulating measures to improve the domestic food situation.

    In famous essays such as "The Third International and Its Place in History" and "The Tasks of the Third International," Lenin analyzed the historical conditions for the emergence of the Third International, pointed out its historical significance, and determined its tasks, while giving a profound criticism to the leaders of the Second International, pointing out that they had degenerated into traitors to socialism and become accomplices of the bourgeoisie.

    In the preface to "On Deceiving the People with Slogans of Freedom and Equality" and in "Speech at the First All-Russian Congress of Educators and Workers of Socialist Culture," Lenin revealed the opposition between proletarian democracy and bourgeois democracy, pointed out the essential difference between the two, and further expounded the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    "On the State," this famous lecture, simply and clearly explained the foundation of the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state—the origin, essence, and historical forms of the state.

    In the article "A Great Beginning," Lenin highly evaluated the great role of the communist subbotniks initiated by the working masses, and pointed out the decisive significance of increasing labor productivity for the victory of communism.

    In addition, several letters and telegrams included in this volume to the Hungarian Soviet Republic, the Bavarian Soviet Republic, Italian and British Communists, and German workers and working peasants, fully demonstrate Lenin's concern for the international communist movement. In the letter "Salute to the Hungarian Workers," Lenin profoundly analyzed the necessity of implementing the dictatorship of the proletariat during the transition period from capitalism to socialism, pointed out the measures to be taken by the proletarian regime to build socialism, and at the same time, with great enthusiasm, encouraged the Hungarian workers to fight and persevere to promote the victory of the international proletarian cause.

    列宁全集二十九卷中文版出版
    新华社11日讯　“列宁全集”第二十九卷中文译本已经由人民出版社出版，从12日起开始在北京和全国各地新华书店发行。
    这一卷包括列宁在1919年3月到8月的著作，其中大部分是在各种会议上的报告和讲演。这些著作充分地反映了列宁领导初创的社会主义国家的卓越活动，阐明了这一时期共产党和苏维埃政权政策中一些最重要的问题，如保卫社会主义祖国，对中农的态度，同经济困难作斗争等。
    在“俄共（布）党纲草案”和在俄共（布）第八次代表大会的报告和发言中，列宁总结了苏维埃国家诞生一年多来的丰富经验，论证了无产阶级专政的基本任务，提出了党为社会主义斗争的具体纲领：打破资产阶级的反抗，按社会主义统一计划管理和发展国民经济，吸收工人和劳动群众参加国家管理，有条不紊地逐渐以社会主义原则改造小农经济。在“关于农村工作的报告”中，列宁根据新的情况，提出了由中立中农进到同中农实行坚固联盟并保持无产阶级在这个联盟中的领导作用的政策。
    关于动员工人阶级和劳动群众去同高尔察克作斗争的著作有：在莫斯科苏维埃全会非常会议上“关于苏维埃共和国的国内外状况的报告”、“为支援东线告彼得格勒工人书”、“俄共（布）中央关于东线局势的提纲”、“同高尔察克作斗争”等。在“为战胜高尔察克告工农书”中，列宁说明了从战胜高尔察克的经验中得出的有关增强苏维埃共和国国防力量的基本任务。
    在“关于目前形势和苏维埃政权的当前任务”、“关于国内外状况”、“关于粮食状况和军事形势”等著作中，列宁号召用一切力量同邓尼金作斗争，同时说明了苏维埃政权粮食政策的基本原则，规定了改善国内粮食状况的措施。
    在“第三国际及其在历史上的地位”、“论第三国际的任务”等著名论文中，列宁分析了第三国际产生的历史条件，指出了第三国际的历史意义，确定了它的任务，同时给了第二国际首领们深刻的批判，指出他们已堕落为社会主义的叛徒，变成资产阶级的帮凶。
    在“关于用自由平等口号欺骗人民”出版序言中和“在全俄教育工作者和社会主义文化工作者第一次代表大会上的演说”中，列宁揭示了无产阶级民主和资产阶级民主的对立，指出两者的本质的区别，进一步阐明了无产阶级专政的理论。
    “论国家”这篇有名的讲演，通俗地阐明了马克思列宁主义的国家学说的基础——国家的起源、实质及其历史形式。
    在“伟大的创举”一文中，列宁高度地评价了由工人群众发起组织的共产主义星期六义务劳动的伟大作用，指出了提高劳动生产率对于共产主义胜利的决定意义。
    另外，收入这一卷的几封致匈牙利苏维埃共和国、巴伐利亚苏维埃共和国、意大利和英国共产党人及德国工人、劳动农民的信和电报，充分地表明了列宁对国际共产主义运动的关怀。在“向匈牙利工人致敬”的信中，列宁深刻地分析了从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期实行无产阶级专政的必要性，指出了为建设社会主义无产阶级政权需要采取的措施，同时以高度的热情鼓舞匈牙利工人要战斗下去，支持下去，以促进国际无产阶级事业的胜利。
