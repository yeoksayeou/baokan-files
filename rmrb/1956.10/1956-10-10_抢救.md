　　Mr. Xi谛 spoke in "Strolling Through the Book Forest" about the importance and urgency of rescuing ancient books as a legacy (see "People's Daily," September 3rd). Similarly, rescuing the legacy of traditional opera is equally important and urgent. Ancient books need to be rescued from waste paper collection stations, while the legacy of traditional opera is hidden in the minds of old performers. Mr. Wang Yaoqing was a grand master of Peking Opera art. The government had always planned to record and整理 his artistic experience, but it didn't happen in time, and Wang Yaoqing passed away. Bai Jiahong, a famous old artist of Tongzhou Bangzi, kept more than two hundred plays in his head. Cadres rushed to listen to his oral narration and transcribe them, but only twelve plays were copied down before Bai Jiahong passed away. Mr. Xi谛 was deeply touched by the rescue of a copy of Yu Xiangdou's "Romance of the States," and even more saddened by the "eternal sinking to the bottom of the sea" of the other seven volumes of Yu Xiangdou's "Romance of the States" and countless other books. We see that Wang Yaoqing's last work, the Peking Opera "Liuyin Ji," and Bai Jiahong's twelve plays were able to be passed down, and we feel infinitely saddened that their other, much richer artistic experiences and opera plays, as well as countless other legacies, could not be rescued in time!
　　Mr. Xi谛, when talking about the fact that some people who collect "waste paper" deliberately tear up and destroy whole books in advance because they are afraid that cultural departments will come to select ancient books, said with great grief: "I don't understand, what kind of psychology is at work here!" We also have to talk about the attitude and practices of some theater troupes towards old artists, such as the incident in which the leaders of the Luoyang Opera (Henan Opera) Troupe expelled Zhai Yansheng, the teacher of Chang Xiangyu and Ma Jinfeng, who came to request work, and we cannot help but painfully question, "What kind of psychology is at work here after all!"
　　Some old artists are fortunate enough to be kept in the troupe, but they are deprived of the right to speak on artistic issues. Because they only have hundreds of "old plays" in their heads, while the cadres want to stage "new plays." If the new plays are truly educational and have a certain artistic quality, of course they should be promoted. But the "new plays" staged by some cadres are another matter. Old artists only understand traditional tunes, but the cadres want to compose music; old artists only understand percussion patterns, but the cadres want to use batons; old artists only understand traditional notation, but the cadres want to use numbered musical notation or staff notation; old artists only know stage movements and water sleeves, but the cadres want to use ballet; old artists only know acting techniques, but the cadres want to use some system that they haven't even figured out themselves; in short, old artists are only proficient in national opera, but the cadres want to create "hybrids" that are neither Chinese nor Western - this is the specific content of the "psychology at work"! As a result, old artists are completely unable to get ahead, and the national legacy has no choice but to rot in their stomachs.
　　Under these circumstances, old artists naturally dare not take on apprentices, and those who have taken them on have been dismissed. Young people naturally do not want to learn from the old masters, and moreover, the past master-apprentice system, which had its shortcomings but also its advantages, has been labeled as "feudal" and struck down with one blow! Alas, how sad... Who can appreciate the joy and comfort that a master gets from passing on his mantle to future generations, and who can appreciate the infinite pain and sadness that an unselfish person feels knowing that his skills will be permanently eliminated in his generation - especially when what is to be passed on is not a private matter, but a national tradition!
　　Not only that. Old artists in the troupe must also "humbly study" numbered musical notation... etc., otherwise they will be seen as "backward." It's not a big deal to just wear the label of "backward," the serious problem is that their jobs are not guaranteed. The following kind of talk can often be heard: "The reason why we let you stay in the troupe now is entirely out of consideration. If we were to follow the principle of remuneration according to work, we would have no obligation to support you for nothing..." This is another aspect of the "psychology at work" confessing itself. As a result, the old artists are uneasy and apprehensive, and even if they are old and frail, they have to go on stage to play a minor role. And the meager wages are beyond words. As for those old artists who have lost their ability to work due to old age and have been kicked out of the troupe, they have no choice but to wander the streets, their lives uncertain. Every time I think of this, I cannot control my emotions! Ah, let those guardians of the national opera legacy who have worked hard all their lives be able to spend their old age warmly and with enough food, and pass on their artistic wealth...
　　We must not only rescue the legacy, but also rescue the people. To rescue the legacy, we must first rescue the people.
　　As I write this, I suddenly hear that the Shanghai Cultural Bureau has sent cadres to record and organize Mr. Gai Jiaotian's artistic experience, and the Anhui Provincial Cultural Bureau is gathering ten old Huiban artists to excavate about four hundred Huiju opera plays. What encouraging news this is! May more such news continue to be reported!　——Appendix

　　抢救
　　屠岸
    西谛先生在“漫步书林”中谈到抢救古书这项遗产的重要性和迫切性（见9月3日“人民日报”），相同的是抢救戏曲遗产也一样重要和迫切。古书要到废纸收购处去抢救，而戏曲遗产则藏在老艺人的肚子里。王瑶卿先生是京剧艺术的一代宗师，政府一直打算去记录整理他的艺术经验，但没有来得及进行，王瑶卿逝世了。同州梆子名老艺人拜家红肚里保存着二百多本戏，干部急忙去听他口述，进行抄录，但只抄下了十二个剧目，拜家红逝世了。西谛先生见一册余象斗“列国志传”的得救，益感其他七册余象斗“列国志传”乃至无数他书的“冤沉海底”而痛心。我们见王瑶卿的最后遗作京剧“柳荫记”的唱腔设计和拜家红的十二个剧目的得以流传，益感他们的其他更丰富得不知多少倍的艺术经验和戏曲剧目以及无数其他遗产的不能及时救出而感到无限痛心！
    西谛先生在谈到有些收“废纸”的人因为怕文化部门的人来挑选古籍，就把整本整部的书故意先行撕破捣烂的事实时，痛心疾首地说：“不明白，这是什么一种心理在作祟！”我们也要谈到有些剧团对待老艺人的态度和作法，例如洛阳歌（豫）剧团的领导人驱逐前来请求工作的老艺人——常香玉、马金凤的启蒙老师翟炎生的事件，而不得不痛心疾首地责问“这究竟是什么一种心理在作祟”！
    有些老艺人幸而被留在剧团，但是在艺术问题上却被剥夺了发言权。因为他们肚子里只有几百出“旧戏”，而干部要排“新戏”。若是真正有教育意义而又有一定艺术质量的新戏，当然是应该提倡的。但某些干部排的“新戏”却是另一回事。老艺人只懂曲牌，干部要来作曲；老艺人只懂锣鼓点子，干部要来指挥棒；老艺人只懂工尺，干部要来简谱或五线谱；老艺人只会身段、水袖，干部要来巴蕾舞；老艺人只懂做工，干部要来他自己还没弄通的什么什么体系；总之，老艺人只精通民族戏曲，干部却要创造不中不西的“四不像”——这就是“作祟的心理”的具体内容！于是，老艺人完全吃不开，民族遗产只好在肚子里烂掉。
    在这种情势下，老艺人自然不敢收学徒，收了的也退掉了，青年人自然不愿跟老师傅学，更何况过去的虽有缺点却有其优越性的师徒制度被扣上“封建的”大帽子而一棒打死了呢！呜呼，哀莫大焉……有谁能体会到师傅把衣钵传给后代而得到的愉快和安慰呵，又有谁能体会到一个不自私的人知道自己的本领将在自己这一代永远消灭而感到的无限痛苦和悲哀呵——更何况要传的不是一家之私，而是民族传统呢！
    不仅如此。老艺人在剧团中还必须“虚心学习”简谱……等等，否则就要被目为“落伍”。单单戴个“落伍”的帽子还不打紧，严重的问题在于饭碗不保。像下面这种话是常常可以听到的：“现在让你留在剧团，完全是照顾性质。若是根据按劳取酬的原则，我们原是没有非白白养活你不可的义务的……”这是“作祟的心理”的又一方面的自白。于是老艺人惴惴然，惶惶然，即使怎样的年迈力衰，也要登台去跑个龙套。而工资的微薄，更不在言下。至于那些由于年迈丧失了劳动力而被撵出剧团的老艺人，就只好流落街头，生死未卜。每念及此，我就不能控制自己的感情！啊，让那些辛勤地劳动了一生的民族戏曲遗产的守护人，能够温饱地度过他们的晚年并把他们的艺术财富传留下来吧……
    我们不仅要抢救遗产，还要抢救人。我们要抢救遗产，就首先要抢救人。
    行文至此，忽闻上海文化局已派干部去记录整理盖叫天先生的艺术经验，安徽省文化局正集中了十一名徽班老艺人，挖掘了约四百个徽戏剧目，这是多么令人鼓舞的消息！但愿更多的这样的消息不断报来！　——附记
