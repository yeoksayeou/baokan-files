Xinhua News Agency, 2nd – President Sukarno and his entourage, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi, visited Beijing's famous scenic spots, Beihai Park and the Temple of Heaven, this morning. Beihai Park and the Temple of Heaven, after the holiday, were crowded with tourists. Wherever President Sukarno went, the tourists automatically lined the streets to applaud and welcome the President.

During the tour, President Sukarno looked very carefully at every archway, bridge, temple, Buddha statue, and mural, and asked many questions. President Sukarno studied engineering in his early years. He spent the longest time visiting the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests in the Temple of Heaven. He sometimes pointed to the tall dome with his cane, and sometimes gently tapped the thick pillars with his hand, carefully listening to the sound of the tapping. The President praised the structure of this fifteenth-century building built by the working people.

In Beihai, President Sukarno climbed the White Pagoda to get a panoramic view of Beijing. Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed to a place in Zhongnanhai with flags hanging and said to the President: "That's where you live!"

During the tour, President Sukarno was very concerned about the people's lives. When passing a canteen, the President asked Vice Premier Chen Yi how much an ordinary meal cost in China. The President had a conversation with a third-year student from Tianjin University and looked at the student's textbooks. The President especially liked children. He took children from the arms of young mothers several times and had photographers take pictures.

In the Temple of Heaven, several children presented President Sukarno with red scarves, and President Sukarno quickly became friends with these children. The children asked the President if he was feeling well. The President said that he was in good health and that the place where he was staying in Beijing was very good, and the food was also very good. The President asked the children to sing a song, and the children immediately sang "The First Day of School." Finally, the President also agreed to the children's request and sang an Indonesian folk song with his entourage.

    苏加诺总统游览北海和天坛
    据新华社2日讯　苏加诺总统和他的随行人员由陈毅副总理陪同，今天上午游览了北京的名胜——北海公园和天坛。节日后的北海公园和天坛，游人如织，苏加诺总统走到那里，那里的游人就自动列成夹道向总统鼓掌欢迎。
    苏加诺总统在游览的时候，对每一座牌楼、桥梁、庙宇、佛像和壁画都看得很仔细，并发问许多问题。苏加诺总统早年曾学过工程。他在天坛祈年殿里参观的时间最长，他有时用手杖指着那高大的圆屋顶，有时用手轻轻地敲击那粗大的柱子，仔细倾听敲击的声音。总统对这座劳动人民建造起来的十五世纪的建筑物的土木结构称赞不已。
    在北海，苏加诺总统登上白塔纵览北京景色。陈毅副总理指着中南海一处挂有旗帜的地方对总统说：“那就是你住的地方！”
    在游览的时候，苏加诺总统对人民的生活很关心。在路过一个食堂的时候，总统问陈毅副总理在中国吃一顿普通饭要多少钱。总统曾同天津大学的一个三年级学生进行了交谈，并且观看了这个大学生的课本。总统特别喜欢小朋友。他曾好几次从年青母亲的手里抱过小孩，让摄影记者照了像。
    在天坛，有几个少年儿童向苏加诺总统献了红领巾，苏加诺总统很快就同这几个少年儿童交成了朋友。孩子们问总统身体好不好，总统说，他的身体很好，并说，他在北京住的地方很好，吃的饭也很好。总统要孩子们唱一支歌，孩子们马上唱了一支“开学那天”，最后总统也答应了孩子们的请求，同他的随行人员一起唱了一只印度尼西亚民歌。
