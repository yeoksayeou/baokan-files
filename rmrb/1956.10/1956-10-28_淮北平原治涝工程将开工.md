    Huaihe River Plain Waterlogging Control Project to Commence
    According to Xinhua News Agency, preparations for the large-scale waterlogging control project on the Huaihe River Plain in Anhui Province are progressing actively, and full-scale construction can begin in early November.
    The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has determined the policy for managing waterlogging in the Huaihe River area as "enclose and cultivate, store water locally." In the first year, Fuyang and Bengbu Special Districts will enclose 150 areas this winter and next spring, construct 1,851 small structures such as culverts and bridges, with a total earthwork volume of over 83 million cubic meters. In each enclosed area and where conditions permit, 4 million mu of rice will be planted next year. Currently, the waterlogging control and cultivation command headquarters and general headquarters have been established in Fuyang and Bengbu Special Districts and their respective counties. The survey work to determine the enclosure lines has essentially concluded. Survey teams are working intensively in the low-lying areas along the Huaihe River and its tributaries where enclosures are planned. Mengcheng County has already surveyed 15 enclosures. The surveying task in Wuhe County has been completed. Many counties are rushing to carry out design work. The key enclosure projects directly managed by the Bengbu Special Administrative Office will soon be designed.
    More than 500,000 laborers will participate in the enclosure construction this winter. Because the enclosure construction is a new task for the Huaihe River area, the Fuyang and Bengbu Special Administrative Offices and the people's committees of each county have trained nearly 4,000 technical professional cadres in the past month. At the same time, the two special administrative offices are constantly sending agricultural and water conservancy cadres at all levels to Wuhu Special District to visit and learn.

    淮北平原治涝工程将开工
    据新华社讯　安徽省淮北平原大规模治涝工程的准备工作正在积极进行，11月上旬可以全面动工。
    中共安徽省委员会对治理淮北地区的内涝，确定的方针是“圈圩改种，就地蓄水”。第一年，阜阳、蚌埠两专区今冬明春将圈圩一百五十处，兴建涵闸、桥梁等小型建筑物一千八百五十一座，总土方数达八千三百多万公方。在各圈圩和有条件的地方，明年将改种水稻四百万亩。现在，阜阳、蚌埠两专区和所辖各县都分别成立了治涝改种指挥部和总队部。为确定圩线而进行的查勘工作，已经基本结束。在沿淮河和淮河各支流两岸将要圈圩的低洼地带，测量队正在紧张地工作。蒙城县已经测量好十五个圩。五河县的测量任务已经完成。不少县赶着进行设计工作。蚌埠专署直接掌握的重点圈圩工程，很快就可以设计完成。
    今冬参加筑圩工程的民工，将在五十万人以上。由于筑圩工程对淮北地区来说是个新的工作，阜阳、蚌埠两个专署和各县人民委员会最近一个月来已经分别训练了将近四千名技术专业干部。同时，两个专署还不断派出各级农业、水利干部，去芜湖专区参观学习。
