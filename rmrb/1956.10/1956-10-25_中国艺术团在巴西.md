	The Chinese Art Troupe in Brazil

	Every year from June to September is opera season in Brazil. During this coolest time of the year (winter), famous artists from all over Brazil and abroad come to the Rio de Janeiro Municipal Theater to perform their most brilliant programs. The Municipal Theater was built in 1909, modeled after the Paris Opera House, with more than two thousand four hundred seats. Just looking at the operatic scenes decorated in marquetry on its exterior walls, one can know how broad the types of plays performed here are.

	Theatergoers in Rio de Janeiro told us that for nearly fifty years, the Municipal Theater has staged various types of operas: from contemporary Brazilian farces and operettas to French comic operas, Italian grand operas, tragic operas... attracting countless audiences; but the spectacle of the Chinese Folk Art Troupe's performance was unprecedented.

	Brazilians were particularly pleased that this year's opera season concluded with the brilliant performance of Chinese Peking Opera. Many people traveled specifically from places like São Paulo and Alegre to see the show. On the opening night, most of the audience were Brazilian government officials and people from all walks of life. They solemnly dressed in formal attire according to local customs to come to the theater. Some ladies who had visited China even wore brocade cheongsams. Whenever the Brazilian actor introducing the program announced the plot in Portuguese or laboriously pronounced the names of the actors such as "Li Shaochun," "Du Jinfang," and "Yuan Shihai," the audience chuckled happily. For Brazilians, these exotic stories and names were so fresh and interesting! The local "People's Daily" wrote: "The audience admired the Chinese artists' exquisite singing, dancing, martial arts, and mimicry with surprised and admiring eyes, the oriental percussion instruments, the dazzlingly gorgeous costumes...; they almost watched the entire performances of 'San Cha Kou', 'Yandang Mountain', 'Havoc in Heaven' with their mouths open..." The "Brazilian Daily" quoted the audience as saying that the actors' "illusion-like movements and astonishing beauty almost took our breath away." The audience was most surprised that Chinese artists sang famous Brazilian folk songs in very accurate Portuguese. Some even doubted their own eyes: standing on the stage was clearly a Chinese girl with black eyes, black hair, and wearing a cheongsam, but "if you closed your eyes, you would really think it was a Brazilian girl singing!"

	In this way, every night the audience watched the Chinese art troupe's program with infinite excitement and joy. After the performance, many people waited at the theater door to say "Goodbye" to the actors in Beijing dialect!

	On September 24, the night before the Chinese art troupe left Rio de Janeiro, a charity performance was held at the famous "Maracanã" football stadium in Brazil to raise funds for local charities. The hall, which can accommodate more than 20,000 spectators, was packed. People welcomed the Chinese artists with stormy cheers and applause, accompanied by thousands of waving handkerchiefs like white waves rising and surging in the stadium. The actors were repeatedly called back to the stage by the enthusiastic audience: "Encore!". When our soprano soloist Liu Shufang and baritone soloist Wei Qixian sang the old Brazilian folk songs "On the Street" and "Who Knows" in fluent Portuguese..., the entire audience suddenly fell silent, listening and nodding, and some were even moved to tears. Countless spectators occasionally raised their hands to touch their ears, which is a gesture Brazilians usually use to express praise.

	In just a few days, the Chinese art troupe's performance had become one of the most popular topics in Rio de Janeiro. Everywhere on the streets, one could hear discussions about the Monkey King Sun Wukong, the Lotus Dance, the Red Silk Dance, or "San Cha Kou." People greeted the Chinese artists from afar by calling out "Ópera de Beijing!" (meaning Beijing Opera) and tried their best to identify who was the old boatman in "Qiujiang" and who was the shepherd boy grazing cattle. The citizens of Rio de Janeiro even launched a lively discussion in the newspapers: China and Brazil are located in two completely opposite regions of the earth—the northern and southern hemispheres, the eastern and western hemispheres, so how can Brazilians so easily accept and be intoxicated by Chinese art? What secrets did Chinese artists use to conquer the distance of time and space?

	Brazilian Senate Vice President A. Sales explained this enthusiastic sentiment of Brazilians to us. He said: "China's ancient and rich culture is something everyone here yearns for, but the long journey of thousands of miles separates us, and Brazilians can't wait to see it with their own eyes; now you have brought the essence of Chinese art here, how can people not be excited!"

	Indeed, Brazilians have a strong interest in China. Whenever they talk about China, they always respectfully mention Li Bai, Du Fu, Confucius, or Lao Tzu, and they are particularly concerned about everything that happens in modern China. Many Brazilians like the famous saying of the American philosopher Durant in 1860: "If you regard China as a barbaric country, you will never come into contact with its splendid culture; if you have no prejudice against China, you will benefit a lot." The famous drama actress Tônia Carrereiro once jokingly said to us with great confidence: "Perhaps Chinese friends only know about Indians and snakes in Brazil; but we know a lot, a lot about China." In Rio de Janeiro, we were very curious to hear a radio announcer recite Tang poetry in Portuguese.

	Brazilian newspapers and periodicals often publish articles and pictures introducing China. Recently, in addition to a large number of introductions to Chinese Peking Opera and folk art, there are also many reports reflecting China's construction, special articles on public health and healthcare work, "Anecdotes about Lu Xun" and the comic strip "Gao Yubao," and so on. There are not many Chinese publications here, but "Chinese Literature" edited and printed by the Foreign Languages Press in Beijing is quite popular. After Comrade Lu Dingyi's report on "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" was published, it was reprinted by the Italian "Unità" and quickly attracted the attention of Brazilian cultural circles. People are particularly concerned about China's writing reform, believing it to be a gospel for all Westerners interested in China. An old professor proficient in five languages repeatedly inquired when Chinese characters could be completely Latinized, as square characters are too difficult for him to learn.

	Brazilian friends told us that Brazilians' special affection for China is not accidental. China and Brazil are both large countries with the same poor and oppressed past. But today, China is developing and growing stronger by leaps and bounds, while many farmers in Brazil are still starving. Brazilians are eager to explore the path China has taken to prosperity and strength. Mr. O. F. Schmitt, the largest industrialist in Brazil, who calls himself a "dead poet, an active industrialist," said: "I am not a friend of China, but I have affection for China; I am very interested in China's ability to achieve independence and prosperity in a very short period of time. I hope that Brazil in the future will be China today."

	Perhaps because of this, Brazilian friends who have visited China are highly respected. They are considered witnesses to the new China. Judge O. de Pereira, who visited China this summer, wrote a book titled "We and China" comparing Brazil and China, which sold several thousand copies at once. Aram Zogi, who visited China after attending the Helsinki Journalists' Conference, is currently giving reports on his impressions of visiting China in São Paulo, and there are many listeners. After the legal workers Sherlva and his wife, who left Beijing at the end of July, returned to China, their house was almost always full of guests, who liked to come here to taste Longjing tea, Jasmine tea, smoke Zhonghua brand cigarettes, and admire the books, newspapers, photos, and things they brought back from China, and listen to what they had seen and heard in China.

	All Brazilian friends who have visited China retain the warmest memories of it. One young lady even burst into tears when she mentioned China, "The Chinese people are so good to us!" They almost remember every friend they made in China, from national leaders to ordinary farmers, model workers, and Young Pioneers. Ms. Daisy Moreira, who visited China two years ago, still misses her translator Zhong Jun, who was such a sweet girl. Mr. Egot Bubam, who traveled in China for ten days last spring, asked about the health of Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, and Xiao San as soon as we met. Legal worker Bitencourt told Mr. Chu Tunan, the head of the art troupe: "When we went to China, we were friends of China, and after returning home, we have become brothers of China."

	They welcomed the Chinese art troupe like relatives. On the first day we arrived in Rio de Janeiro, the President of the Brazilian Women's Federation, Blanca Feyalo, brought flowers to the hotel to express her condolences, happily introducing herself as Cai Chang's good friend, and having participated in the International Democratic Women's Federation Council meeting held in Beijing in April this year. When we went to Mr. Pereira's family banquet, we heard the majestic singing of the "March of the Volunteers" as soon as we entered the door, followed by "The East is Red", "Yao Nationality Dance Music"... The children greeted us with crisp Beijing dialect "Hello". Mrs. Pereira personally made Chinese-flavored braised chicken and rice. There were even bamboo chopsticks produced in Hankou. We flipped through the various pictorials sent from the motherland, talked about the big and small things in Beijing, and felt infinitely cordial. No wonder Mr. Pereira said that we were invited to "Little Beijing in Brazil." On September 29, the art troupe left Rio de Janeiro for São Paulo, passing through a small mountain called Itatiaia on the way. Mr. and Mrs. Brito, who had visited China, insisted on inviting the entire troupe to rest and have lunch at their villa on the mountain.

	While appreciating Chinese art, Brazilian friends also actively introduced Brazilian culture and art to us. Under their warm guidance and accompaniment, we visited various Brazilian museums, art galleries, and exhibition halls, and watched the plays "The Teahouse of the August Moon" and "The Corruption of Morals." Particularly unforgettable was a grand party organized by the Brazilian cultural circles. Chinese artists met the most famous artists in Brazil at this enthusiastic meeting: the internationally renowned musician Heitor Villa-Lobos, the outstanding composer Ary Barroso, male singers Xavier Cugat and Dorival Caymmi, young female singer Sterlina who had won awards at the World Youth and Student Festival, famous black singer Odette Lara, and various artists from the famous black amateur dance troupe. Brazil's most popular female singer, Ouro Branco, specially rushed from São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro to participate in the party; Gaita, a harmonica soloist who is very famous throughout the Western Hemisphere, gave up his TV program to perform for Chinese artists. Throughout the evening, we were immersed in the performance of typical Brazilian folk art: folk songs with strong ethnic flavor, fast and enthusiastic samba dances, wildly spinning conga dances, and quick dances that combine the characteristics of Indian and black folk dances.... Everyone laughed and sang to their hearts' content. If the Chinese art troupe did not have a performance the next day, the party would have continued until dawn.

	In Brazil, the visit of the Chinese art troupe has been seen as the first handshake between the people of the two countries through art, and everyone hopes that this friendly relationship can continue to develop. We are pleased to hear that: In October, a Brazilian trade delegation will go to China for negotiations; friends in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai..., etc. will soon be able to enjoy the wonderful performances of famous Brazilian artists; the Chairman of the Rio de Janeiro City Council, Baias Limi, has decided to visit China this winter; in the future, Beijing will receive more Brazilian guests. Brazilian young friends are already waiting to participate in the World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival to be held in Beijing in 1959. When we bid farewell to Rio de Janeiro, they said to us with certainty "See you in Beijing." The hotel waiter did not know when he would see Chinese friends again, and kept sending us to the gate, insisting that we say hello to Mao Zedong for him—an ordinary Brazilian! (Attached picture)

    中国艺术团在巴西
    萧光
    每年6月到9月，是巴西歌剧的季节。在这一年最凉爽的时令里（冬天），全巴西和外国著名的艺术家都到里约热内卢市立剧院来演出他们最精采的节目。市立剧院是在1909年仿照巴黎歌剧院的形式建成的，有二千四百多个座位，光看它外墙上用镶嵌细工装饰的种种歌剧场面，就可以知道这里上演的剧种有多么广泛。
    里约热内卢的戏迷告诉我们，近五十年来，市立剧院上演过各种类型的歌剧：从巴西当代的闹剧、轻歌剧到法国的喜歌剧，意大利的大歌剧，悲歌剧……，不知吸引过多少观众；但像中国民间艺术团演出的这种盛况，还是头一回。
    巴西人特别满意今年歌剧的季节是以中国京剧辉煌的演出来宣告结束。许多人专门从圣保罗、阿雷格累等地方赶来看戏。开幕式那天晚上，来观剧的大都是巴西政府官员和各界人士。他们按照当地的习俗隆重地穿起礼服前来剧院。一些访问过中国的女士还特地穿上了织锦缎的旗袍。每当报幕的巴西演员用葡萄牙话介绍剧情，或是吃力地念出“李少春”、“杜近芳”、“袁世海”等演员名字的时候，观众就愉快地小声笑了起来。对于巴西人来说，这些充满了异国情调的故事和名称，是多么的新鲜和有趣呵！当地的“人民报”写道：“观众以惊讶和佩服的眼光欣赏着中国艺术家们绝妙的歌、舞、武打和摹拟动作，东方的击敲乐器、华丽得眩眼的戏装……；他们几乎是张着嘴巴看完整出整出的‘三岔口’、‘雁荡山’、‘闹天宫’……。”“巴西日报”引用观众的话说，演员“幻术一样的动作和惊人的美丽使我们差点喘不过气来。”观众最惊奇的还有：中国艺术家竟用非常准确的葡萄牙话演唱著名的巴西民歌。有人甚至怀疑起自己的眼睛来：舞台上明明站的是一位黑眼睛、黑头发身穿旗袍的中国女郎，但“如果闭眼不看，真以为是一位巴西的姑娘在歌唱！”
    就这样，每天夜晚观众以无限兴奋和喜悦的心情欣赏中国艺术团的节目。散场以后许多人守在剧院门口等着和演员用北京话说“再见”！
    9月24日，中国艺术团离开里约热内卢的前一天晚上，在巴西著名的“马拉加尼亚”足球场举行了一场为当地慈善事业募款的义演。可以容纳两万多观众的大厅被挤得水泄不通。人们用暴风雨似的欢呼和掌声欢迎中国艺术家，伴随着千百条上下挥舞的手绢就像一道道白色的波浪在场内起伏、奔腾。演员一次又一次地被热情的观众唤回台前：“再来一个”。当我们的女高音独唱家刘淑芳和男中音独唱家魏启贤用娴熟的葡萄牙话唱出巴西古老的民歌“在街上”、“有谁知道”……的时候，全场一下子静得没有一点声音，人们一边听一边点头，有的还感动得流下泪来。无数观众不时抬起手来摸摸自己的耳朵，这是巴西人通常表示赞美的一种手势。
    仅仅几天，中国艺术团的演出已成了里约热内卢人最热烈的话题之一。街头巷尾，到处可以听见关于猴王孙悟空、荷花舞、红绸舞或是“三岔口”的谈论。人们远远地见到中国艺术家就招呼“奥波拉得北京”！（意即北京的歌剧）并且极力辨认哪个是“秋江”里的老梢翁，哪个是放牛的牧童。里约热内卢的市民甚至津津有味地在报纸上展开讨论：中国和巴西处在地球上两个完全相反的两个地区——北半球和南半球，东半球和西半球，怎么巴西人却那样容易接受和陶醉中国的艺术？中国艺术家究竟用什么样的秘诀征服了时间和空间的距离？
    巴西参议院副主席阿·萨累斯先生曾和我们解释巴西人的这种热烈情绪。他说：“中国古老而丰富的文化，是这里人人所向往的，但是万里迢迢的路程阻隔着我们，巴西人恨不能亲眼一见；现在你们把中国艺术的结晶带到这里，怎么能不让人兴奋！”
    的确，巴西人对中国有着浓厚的兴趣。他们每逢谈起中国，总要尊敬地提到李白、杜甫、孔子或老子，对现代中国所发生的一切格外关心。许多巴西人喜欢美国哲学家杜伦德在1860年时候说的一句名言：“如果把中国看成一个野蛮的国家，你就永远接触不到它的灿烂文化；如果对中国没有成见，你就将受益不浅”。著名的话剧女演员佟尼亚·卡瑞里罗曾经很自信地和我们开玩笑：“也许中国朋友对巴西只知道印第安人和蛇；但是我们却了解中国很多，很多”。在里约热内卢，我们就曾非常好奇地听到一位电台的播音员用葡萄牙文背诵唐诗。
    巴西的报刊经常登载介绍中国的文章和图片。最近这个时期，除了大量介绍中国的京剧和民间艺术，还有不少反映中国建设的通讯、有关公共卫生和保健工作的专文、“鲁迅二三事”和连环画“高玉宝”等。这里中国出版的书报不多，但是北京外文出版社编印的“中国文学”还挺受欢迎。陆定一同志“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的报告发表以后，意大利的“团结报”转载了它，很快就引起了巴西文化界的注意。人们特别关心中国的文字改革，认为这是所有对中国感兴趣的西方人的福音。一位精通五国语言的老教授一再打听中国文字什么时候可以完全拉丁化，方块字对他实在太难学了。
    巴西朋友告诉我们，巴西人对中国特别有感情并不是偶然的，中国和巴西同是两个大国，有着同样贫穷和遭受压迫的过去。但是今天，中国已在一日千里地发展，壮大，而巴西的许多农民还饿得吃不上饭。巴西人渴望探求中国走向繁荣、富强的途径。自称是“死去了的诗人，活动着的工业家”的巴西最大的实业家奥·弗·司密脱先生说：“我不是中国的朋友，但是我对中国有感情；对中国能在很短的时期内走到了独立、富强，感到很大的兴趣。我希望将来的巴西是今天的中国。”
    也许正因为这点，访问过中国的巴西朋友受到很大推崇。他们被认为是新中国的见证人。今年夏天访问中国的法官奥·德·彼里拉，以巴西和中国对比的笔法写了一本“我们和中国”，一下子销行了几千本。参加过赫尔辛基新闻工作者会议后到中国参观访问的阿拉姆佐治，这两天正在圣保罗做访问中国观感的报告，听众很多。7月底离开北京的法律工作者薛尔华夫妇回国以后，家里几乎天天高朋满座，人们喜欢到这里来尝尝龙井、香片，抽抽中华牌香烟，观赏薛尔华夫妇从中国带回来的书报、照片，倾听他们在中国所见所闻。
    所有访问过中国的巴西朋友都对它保留着最亲切的回忆。有一位年青太太甚至一提起中国就激动得流泪，“中国人对我们太好了！”他们几乎记得在中国所交的每一位朋友，从国家的领导人到普通的农民、劳动模范和红领巾。两年前到过中国的黛茜·莫里拉女士至今念念不忘她的译员中筠是一位多么甜蜜的姑娘。去年春天在中国旅行了十天的艾戈特·布巴姆先生见面就打听郭沫若、陈叔通和萧三的健康。法律工作者比顿科尔特先生对艺术团楚图南团长说：“我们去中国的时候是中国的朋友，回国之后已成为中国的兄弟了。”
    他们像迎接亲人一样的接待中国艺术团，我们到达里约热内卢的第一天，巴西妇女联合会主席布朗卡·费雅洛就带着鲜花来旅馆慰问，愉快地介绍自己是蔡畅的好朋友，今年4月参加了在北京举行的国际民主妇联理事会会议。我们赴彼里拉先生家宴的时候，一进门就听见“义勇军进行曲”的雄壮歌声，接着是“东方红”
  “徭族舞曲”……，孩子们用清脆的北京话“你好”迎接我们。彼里拉夫人亲自做中国味道的红烧鸡和大米饭。居然还有汉口出产的竹筷子。我们翻看着从祖国寄来的各种画报，谈论着北京的大大小小事情，感到无限亲切。难怪彼里拉先生说把我们请到了“巴西的小北京”。9月29日，艺术团离开里约热内卢到圣保罗去，途中经过一座名叫意大梯亚的小山，被访问过中国的布丽多夫妇坚持邀全团到他们在山上的别墅中去休息和用午饭。
    巴西朋友在欣赏中国艺术的同时，也积极向我们介绍巴西的文化艺术，在他们的热情引导和陪伴下，我们参观了巴西的各种博物馆、美术馆、展览馆，观看了话剧“八月月亮的茶馆”“道德的败坏”。特别令人难忘的是巴西文化界组织的一次盛大的联欢晚会。中国艺术家在这次热情洋溢的会上结识了全巴西最著名的艺术家：享有国际声誉的音乐家盖托尔·维拉洛波斯、杰出的作曲家阿瑞·巴罗梭、男歌唱家薛尔微欧和多瑞瓦尔、在世界青年和学生联欢节上得过奖的青年女歌唱家斯特琳娜、黑人名歌手奥达福、还有出名的黑人业余歌舞团的各位艺术家。巴西最受欢迎的女歌唱家奥罗珊特特地从圣保罗赶到里约热内卢来参加晚会；在整个西半球都很出名的口琴独奏家加伊达放弃了自己的电视节目来为中国艺术家表演。整个晚上，我们都沉醉在巴西典型的民间艺术的演奏里：具有强烈民族气息的民歌，快速、热烈的姗巴舞，疯狂旋转的康奇勃来舞，综合了印第安人和黑人民间舞特点的快舞……。大家尽情的欢笑和歌唱。如果不是中国艺术团第二天有演出，联欢会会一直进行到天亮。
    在巴西，中国艺术团的访问已被看成是两国人民通过艺术的初次握手，人人都希望这种友好关系能够继续发展。我们高兴地听到：10月间，巴西的贸易代表团将到中国去进行谈判；北京、天津、上海……等地的朋友不久就能欣赏巴西著名艺术家的精采表演；里约热内卢的市议会主席巴伊斯·李米已经决定今年冬天去中国访问；今后北京还将接待更多的巴西客人。巴西的青年朋友，现在已经开始等待参加1959年将在北京举行的世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节了，当我们告别里约热内卢的时候，他们肯定地和我们说“北京见”。旅馆的侍者不知道什么时候再见到中国朋友，一直送到大门口，一定要我们替他——一个普通的巴西人向毛泽东问好！（附图片）
