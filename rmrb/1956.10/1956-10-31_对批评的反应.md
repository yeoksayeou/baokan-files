Reactions to Criticism

    Yichang is no longer a city of sorrow for travelers
    A letter from the Chongqing Port Authority of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration states: Regarding the problem of stranded passengers in Yichang, as reflected in the article "Yichang - A City of Sorrow for Travelers" published in the People's Daily on July 8th, active measures have now been taken with the attention of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration and relevant ports. Joint passenger tickets for Chongqing-Yichang-Hankou have been issued from Chongqing and Hankou ports, solving the difficulty of passengers being delayed in Yichang when transferring ships and waiting for assembly. At the same time, transportation capacity has been increased and coordinated. At present, there is basically no backlog of passengers in Yichang.
    Recovering discarded timber
    A letter from the Wumin River Forest Industry Bureau of the Yichun Forestry Administration states: The criticism of our bureau in the article "130,000 Cubic Meters of Timber Discarded" on the second page of the People's Daily on August 18th has attracted the attention of all our employees, especially leaders at all levels. We all agree that this criticism is entirely correct.
    In the past few years, the problem of timber being discarded has been very serious in our bureau's timber production. This is mainly because we lack a high sense of responsibility towards state property. On August 23rd, we held a bureau meeting to systematically review the measures put forward in the past and formulated more than ten specific supplementary measures to eliminate waste of timber. In order to recover the losses of the state, we have dispatched thirty-six cadres and more than fifty workers to carry out the work of debarking and preserving the timber, and began to recover the discarded timber from September.

    对批评的反应
    宜昌不再是旅客的愁城
    长江航运管理局重庆港务局来信：关于人民日报7月8日刊载的
  “宜昌——旅客的愁城”一文中反映的在宜昌积压旅客的问题，现在，在长江航运管理局及有关港口的重视下，已采取了积极的措施，由重庆、汉口两港发售重庆—宜昌—汉口的联运客票，解决了旅客在宜昌转船、集船延误时间的困难；同时增调了运力，并使运力相衔接。目前，宜昌的旅客已基本上没有积压了。
    拣回被丢弃的木材
    伊春森林工业管理局乌敏河森林工业局来信说：人民日报8月18日第二版“十三万立方公尺木材被丢弃了”一文，对我局的批评，已引起我们全体职工尤其各级领导人员的注意。我们一致认为这个批评是完全正确的。
    我局几年来在木材生产中，木材丢弃问题是十分严重的。这主要是由于我们对国家财产缺乏高度责任心。8月23日我们召开了一次局务会议，系统地检查了过去所提出的措施，制定了十余项杜绝浪费木材的具体补充措施。为了挽回国家损失，我们已抽出三十六名干部和五十多名工人，进行木材的剥皮防腐工作，从9月份起开始拣回被丢弃的木材。
