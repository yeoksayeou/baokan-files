    Doctor Huang Teaches Apprentices
    Zhang Wei
    Huang Shouren is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) doctor in Wuhan. One day, I went to see him for a medical consultation. After Doctor Huang finished examining me, he recited the names of the herbs, and a person beside him wrote the prescription.
    The person learning to write prescriptions from Doctor Huang is called Feng Faxiang. When Feng Faxiang started learning TCM, Doctor Huang asked him to read "The Herbal Formula," "The Pulse Classic," and some classical medical works, which took about two and a half years to complete. During the period of reading medical books, Doctor Huang would ask Feng Faxiang about his progress every week or so, inquiring whether he understood everything. Feng Faxiang would also often ask his teacher to solve difficult problems. Doctor Huang always explained the problems to his student with his usual earnest and patient attitude. Now, Feng Faxiang has finished reading the prescribed books and is learning prescriptions from his teacher. Feng Faxiang said, "After reading 'The Pulse Classic,' it seems that I understand what kind of pulse corresponds to what kind of disease. However, when I actually take a patient's pulse, I am completely confused. Even if the teacher teaches me how to prescribe according to the symptoms, if I can't diagnose the patient's illness, how can I prescribe?" The teacher, knowing the problem he encountered, paid attention to teaching him how to take pulses and understand the characteristics of patients' pulses while he was learning prescriptions, so that he gradually learned how to diagnose through pulse taking.
    Doctor Huang Shouren has been practicing medicine for thirty-two years and has accumulated a wealth of clinical experience. He passes on these experiences and insights, which are not found in books, to his students one by one. Doctor Huang tells his students that the same symptoms can manifest differently in each person. Therefore, when prescribing medicine, it's essential to understand the cause of the illness and pay attention to whether the patient is fat or thin, from the north or the south. He also says to carefully consider whether each medicine prescribed is suitable for the patient and how to prescribe it more effectively. He also allows his students to regularly read his notebooks, which record his experiences and insights gained from daily diagnoses.
    Feng Faxiang is now learning clinical experience from his teacher, further studying medical books, and also starting to learn to diagnose illnesses independently.
    Doctor Huang is also using the same method to teach another student, Huang Lianqing. Huang Lianqing is now making full use of his spare time and evenings to repeatedly read the medical books assigned by his teacher and learn clinical experience from him.
    Before liberation, Huang Shouren had also taken four apprentices through the introduction of relatives and friends, and now they have all been formally treating patients for more than a decade.
    Doctor Huang's students, whether they are currently learning or have been independently treating patients for more than a decade, all affectionately call him "teacher." They often go to the teacher's home to talk and ask for advice. Not only his students, but also TCM doctors from Wuhan Medical College, the Second Hospital, and the People's Bank Hospital often come to Doctor Huang's home to discuss issues, especially when they encounter difficult problems in treating patients. At Doctor Huang's home, every Saturday evening and Sunday naturally become a place for everyone to study TCM knowledge and exchange experiences.
    Why is Doctor Huang so enthusiastic about teaching apprentices? When I visited him, he said to me, "I am fifty-six years old this year. I started learning TCM when I was in my teens, and I officially started practicing medicine at the age of twenty-four. In these thirty-two years, I have always adhered to my profession. Now, the government is calling on us to take apprentices and vigorously develop TCM. Many people, including Communist Party members, are voluntarily asking to learn TCM, which makes me extremely happy. As soon as the government called for taking apprentices, I immediately responded. Taking apprentices also benefits me, as their questions can encourage me to study. Some of my students have attended TCM advanced study classes and have learned physiology, anatomy, and some scientific principles, which is better than me. Therefore, conservatism is not desirable. Taking apprentices is not troublesome for me, but I also have some experience, which is that I must be patient with apprentices from beginning to end."
    Doctor Huang Shouren has to divide his time each week to treat patients at Wuhan TCM Hospital and the TCM Association clinic. When he returns home, he also has to make time to see patients who come to him specifically and those who come to Wuhan from other counties specifically to see him. Although he is so busy, he is still very enthusiastic about teaching apprentices.

    黄医师带徒弟
    张碨
    黄寿人是武汉市一位有名望的中医。一天，我去找他看病。黄医师给我看完病后，嘴里念药名，旁边有一个人替他写药方。
    这位跟黄医师学习开药方的叫冯发祥。冯发祥在开始学中医的时候，黄医师要他阅读药性赋、脉经和一些古典医药著作，大约在二年半的时间读完。在读医书期间，黄医师隔个把星期就询问冯发祥一次，问他读到哪里了，是不是全懂了。冯发祥也常常来请老师解答难题。黄医师总是以他那惯有的认真和耐心的态度向他的学生讲解问题。现在，冯发祥已把规定的书读完了，跟老师学处方。冯发祥说：“读过脉经后，什么病是什么样的脉，好像都懂了，可是，真正给病人诊脉的时候就完全糊涂了。尽管老师教我对症处方，我如果不会诊脉，断定不了人家是什么病，那怎么处方？”老师知道了他所遇到的这个难题，在他学处方的同时，就注意教他诊脉，了解病人的脉搏特征，使他逐渐学会了诊脉。
    黄寿人医师行医三十二年，积累了很丰富的临床经验。他把这些书上所没有的经验、体会都一一地传授给他的学生。黄医师告诉学生，同样的病症，发生在每个人身上又各有不同的情况，因此，在下药的时候要了解病情原因，注意病人是胖子瘦子，是北方人还是南方人。对病人下每种药都要慎重考虑对他是否适合，如何下药对他会更有效。他还把记载自己日常诊病所得的体会和经验的本子，给学生经常翻阅。
    冯发祥现在一方面向老师学习临床经验，进一步熟读医书；一方面也开始学习独立诊病。
    黄医师也采取同样方法在教另一个学生黄廉卿。黄廉卿现在正充分利用业余时间和晚间反复阅读老师指定的医书，并跟老师学习临床经验。
    黄寿人在解放前因为亲戚朋友的介绍也带过四个徒弟，现在他们都已经正式给人看病十几年了。
    黄医师的学生，不管是现在正学的和已经独立看病十几年的都亲切地称呼他老师。他们经常到老师家去，和老师谈谈，向老师请教。不仅他的学生这样，就是武汉医学院、第二医院、人民银行医院等的中医师，也常常到黄医师家里来和他研究问题，特别是当他们在给病人治病当中遇到疑难问题的时候，都到黄医师家里来和他商量解决。在黄医师的家里，每逢星期六晚上和星期日，很自然地成了大家研究中医学问和交流经验的场合。
    黄医师为什么这样热心地带徒弟呢？我访问他的时候，他对我说：“我今年五十六岁了。从十几岁起，我就学中医，二十四岁正式行医，这三十二年中我一直坚守着自己的职业。现在，政府号召我们带徒弟，要大力发展中医，有许多人，其中还有共产党员都自动要求学中医，我高兴极了。政府一号召带徒弟，我就立刻响应。带徒弟对我也有好处，他们提些问题，可以督促自己学习。我的学生有的上了中医进修班，学习了生理解剖和一些科学道理，这一点就比我强。所以，保守是要不得的。带徒弟对我并不麻烦，不过，我也有些体会，那就是对徒弟自始至终都得有耐心。
    黄寿人医师每个星期内得分头在武汉市中医医院和中医药学会门诊部诊病，回家来还得抽空为那些专门找上门来的病人以及从外县特地来武汉找他看病的人看病。他虽然这样忙，可是他对带徒弟还是很热心的。
