The daily coal output of the Kaganovich Mine in the Stalin Oblast has also increased by dozens of tons in the past few days. The Nevsky Machine Building Plant in Leningrad is manufacturing a new type of compressor for blast furnaces. To welcome the October Revolution Day, they decided to complete the machine ahead of schedule. The machine body section of the plant has completed the October work plan and is now starting work on November. To welcome the October Revolution Day, construction workers at the Novosibirsk Hydropower Station will dam the Ob River in the next few days.
