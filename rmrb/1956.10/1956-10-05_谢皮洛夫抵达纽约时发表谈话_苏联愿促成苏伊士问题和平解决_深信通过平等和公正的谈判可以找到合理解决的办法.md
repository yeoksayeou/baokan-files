Xinhua News Agency, 4th Dispatch: TASS, New York - Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov made a statement to the press and radio reporters upon his arrival in New York on October 3rd.

Shepilov said that we have come here to discuss the Suez Canal issue together with representatives of other member states of the United Nations Security Council. The Soviet government believes that this upcoming meeting of the Security Council is of great significance because the task of this meeting is to prevent the further sharpening of the international situation surrounding the Suez Canal issue, and to find a way for the peaceful resolution of this issue.

Shepilov said that, regrettably, some people are still attempting to resolve the Suez Canal issue through the policy of "positions of strength." Such attempts stem from a lack of understanding of the spirit of the times, and a lack of understanding of the great and invincible process of revolutionary change in the social lifestyles unfolding in the vast regions of the East. Ignoring this process will constitute various rash and impractical proposals for resolving the Suez Canal issue through coercive means. He hopes that there will be fewer and fewer people advocating such means.

Shepilov said, "I am firmly convinced that through negotiations on the basis of equality and justice, and through the correct combination of the interests of Egypt as a sovereign state with the interests of other countries using the canal, we will be able to find a reasonable solution to the Suez Canal issue that is making us uneasy." He is filled with hope that all those working with us in the Security Council will demonstrate the necessary sense of realism, a spirit of mutual understanding and trust, in order to achieve real progress in resolving the Suez Canal issue. He said that the Soviet Union is prepared to do everything in its power to facilitate a resolution of the Suez Canal issue in accordance with the lofty goals of the United Nations and the principles of peace-loving.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th Dispatch: TASS, New York, October 4th - Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov visited United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on October 3rd and held a lengthy conversation with him.

    谢皮洛夫抵达纽约时发表谈话
    苏联愿促成苏伊士问题和平解决
    深信通过平等和公正的谈判可以找到合理解决的办法
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫在10月3日到达纽约的时候向报界和电台记者发表谈话。
    谢皮洛夫说，我们来到这里，是为了要同联合国安全理事会其他理事国的代表一道讨论苏伊士运河问题。苏联政府认为，安全理事会即将举行的这次会议具有重大的意义，因为这次会议的任务是：防止围绕着苏伊士运河问题的国际局势进一步尖锐化，并且为这个问题的和平解决寻找道路。
    谢皮洛夫说，遗憾的是，有人还企图用“实力地位”政策来解决苏伊士运河问题。企图这样做是由于不懂得时代精神，不懂得东方广大地区正在展开的社会生活方式上的伟大的和不可战胜的革新过程。漠视这种过程，就会构成用强制手段来解决苏伊士运河问题的各种各样的急躁和不切实际的方案。他希望主张采用这种手段的人将越来越少。
    谢皮洛夫说，我深信，通过在平等和公正的基础上的谈判，通过把作为主权国家的埃及的利益同使用运河的其他各国的利益的正确结合，我们就能够找到合理地解决使我们不安的苏伊士运河问题的办法。我他满怀希望：所有同我们在安全理事会里共同工作的人将表现必要的现实感、互相谅解和信任的精神，以便在解决苏伊士运河问题方面取得真正的进展。他说，苏联准备尽一切力量，来促成苏伊士运河问题能够本着联合国组织的崇高目标和爱好和平的原则得到解决。
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社纽约4日讯：苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫10月3日访问了联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，并且同他进行了长时间的谈话。
