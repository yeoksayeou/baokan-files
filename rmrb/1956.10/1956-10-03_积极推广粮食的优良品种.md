    Resolution of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China on the Political Report states: "In the near future, our country will not have a large agricultural machinery industry and chemical fertilizer industry, nor will it be able to carry out large-scale land reclamation, and water and drought disasters cannot be quickly eradicated. Therefore, the main way to increase agricultural production at present is to give full play to the superior conditions of basically realizing agricultural cooperation, rely on the collective strength of cooperatives and government support, and adopt measures such as building water conservancy projects, increasing fertilizer application, improving soil, improving varieties, promoting new farm tools, increasing the multiple cropping index, improving cultivation methods, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests to increase yields per unit area."

    Promoting superior varieties of grain is one of the important measures to increase grain production and improve grain quality. According to the materials of the Ministry of Agriculture, in 1955, the total cultivated area of improved varieties of grain crops in my country was about 360 million mu, and there are still about 1.5 billion mu of cultivated area that need to be promoted with improved seeds. According to the provisions of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), starting from 1956, the main grain crops will achieve popularization of improved varieties within seven to twelve years. Furthermore, during and after the popularization process, new improved varieties must be continuously cultivated and replaced, old improved varieties must be rejuvenated and renewed, and a system for breeding improved varieties must be gradually established. This is an important and arduous task.

    According to the provisions of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), agricultural production cooperatives should establish seed plots, and state-owned farms should become bases for breeding improved varieties of crops. That is to say, in addition to guiding agricultural cooperatives to select superior grain seeds locally, the state needs to select superior seeds (including those needed for disaster relief and land reclamation) to be promoted to other regions directly from agricultural cooperatives and state-owned farms, and store them separately according to the categories of seeds so that they can be transported and distributed in time before sowing. This is a series of agricultural science and technology and organizational work. At the same time, the promotion of improved varieties is closely related to changing the cultivation system, planting high-yield crops, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests and other production increase measures. Therefore, this work must be carried out in a planned and prepared manner.

    At present, seed business is managed separately by the agricultural and food departments. The agricultural department manages the planning, breeding, experimentation, and promotion of seeds; the food department handles the purchase, storage, transportation, and supply of seeds according to the plans of the agricultural department. This method of separate management is only a transitional method, and many problems have occurred in the work.

    Since the autumn of last year, agricultural production planning has been carried out throughout the country. Many areas have a very urgent need for promoting improved varieties of seeds, and the varieties required for promotion are numerous, the quantity of allocations is large, the allocation time is very tight, and the transportation routes are long. However, in the past, there was no reserve of improved seeds in the production areas. As a result, the seeds allocated to various places were very messy, and there were frequent occurrences of seeds being allocated but not used, too many seeds being allocated and too few being used, and the supply not meeting the demand, or the varieties and quality being incorrect; and these often caused several accidents, causing economic and political losses to the country. For example, in the autumn of 1955, due to the expansion of the winter sowing task of broad beans and peas in Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi and other provinces, the quantity purchased in the provinces could not meet the needs. In August, people were sent to the commercial grain warehouses in Hubei Province to temporarily select seeds. At that time, the broad beans and peas in stock in Hubei Province generally had insects. Because the provinces urgently needed to sow seeds, the insect pests were ignored, the inspection was perfunctory, and a total of 22 million catties of broad bean and pea seeds were hurriedly transferred. Later, these bean seeds were transported to various provinces, and not only could they not be used as seeds, but they also spread insect pests. For example, the yield of potatoes from Heilongjiang Province is very high when planted in other places. This year, nine provinces and cities, including Liaoning, Shandong, Guangdong, Hebei, Anhui, Henan, Fujian, Beijing, and Tianjin, requested Heilongjiang Province to supply 500 million catties of potato seeds. Heilongjiang Province may be able to supply 100 million to 200 million catties. However, the weather in Heilongjiang is cold early. From the potato harvest to the freezing, there are only 40 to 50 days. The transportation time is tight and the quantity is huge. Past experience has proved that even if the method of transporting fruits is used, it is still difficult to avoid a large number of frostbite or rot during the journey. For another example, this year, wheat in major wheat-producing provinces such as Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu, and Anhui suffered disasters, and most of the wheat produced that year did not meet the seed standards. Various places did not have wheat seed reserves at ordinary times, and 600 million catties or more of wheat seeds had to be temporarily transferred from Shaanxi, Sichuan, and other provinces and cities (Sichuan had a good wheat harvest last year, and although Shaanxi also suffered disasters, there were more old wheat improved varieties), plus a total of 1.5 billion catties of wheat seeds were selected from the province's commercial grain stocks. Such a large amount of wheat seed was all temporarily selected from commercial wheat in various places in a hurry, the inspection was rushed, and the quality of the seeds was difficult to guarantee. In addition, the transportation time was tight, and some places might not be able to transport them in time during the sowing season.

    These situations show that the method of seed management must be further improved to meet the requirements of increased grain production. To this end, I put forward the following suggestions:

    1. A comprehensive and specific plan must be made for the promotion of improved varieties of seeds. It is recommended that the agricultural department put forward annual promotion plans and seed storage plans by region and variety according to needs and possibilities, so that preparations can be made in advance and arrangements can be made for procurement, transportation, and storage, so as to overcome the shortcomings of temporary rush and blind allocation.

    2. Gradually establish a reserve system for seeds for disaster relief and land reclamation. Agricultural cooperatives should store a certain number of improved varieties of seeds every year. The whole country should designate several areas to select a certain number of improved varieties of seeds from commercial grain and store them in separate warehouses for special storage, and rotate them regularly to maintain the quality of the seeds, so as to ensure the needs of disaster areas and land reclamation seeds.

    3. It is recommended that the management of improved seeds (including seeds for disaster relief and land reclamation), from breeding, selection and purchase to supply, should be unified by the agricultural department, and a special management agency should be established to handle the business. At present, the agricultural department's difficulties are lack of funds, warehouses, and business personnel. The food department should allocate a part of the warehouses and funds, and equip it with business cadres for purchase, transportation, storage, and supply (agricultural technical cadres are equipped by the agricultural department) to first establish the agency, so that the purchase, transportation, sales, storage and other businesses have a clue, and then transfer it to the agricultural department for management. The seed management agency can be used as a business agency and conduct separate accounting. The selected seeds can be used to offset the grain unified purchase task, or grain can be exchanged with agricultural cooperatives in equal amounts.

    积极推广粮食的优良品种
    粮食部副部长　陈国栋
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会关于政治报告的决议中说：“在最近的将来我国还不能有很大的农业机械工业和化学肥料工业，还不能进行很大规模的垦荒，水旱灾害也还不能迅速根治。因此，目前农业增产的主要途径，就是要充分发挥农业已经基本上实现合作化这个优越条件，依靠合作社的集体力量和政府的支援，采取兴修水利、增施肥料、改良土壤、改良品种，推广新式农具、提高复种指数、改进耕作方法、防治病虫灾害等项措施，来增加单位面积产量”。
    推广粮食的优良品种是提高粮食产量、改进粮食质量的重要措施之一。根据农业部的材料，1955年我国粮食作物良种栽培的总面积约为三亿六千余万亩，还有十五亿亩左右的栽培面积，需要推广优良种子。按照全国农业发展纲要（草案）的规定，从1956年开始，主要粮食作物在七年至十二年内做到良种普及。并且在普及过程中和普及之后，还要不断地培育更换新的良种，复壮更新旧的良种，逐步建立良种的繁育制度。这是一项重要的也是艰巨的任务。
    按照全国农业发展纲要（草案）规定，农业生产合作社都应当建立种子地，国营农场应当成为繁育农作物良种的基地。这也就是说，国家除了指导农业社就地选用优良的粮食种子以外，向其他地区推广的优良种子（包括备荒、开荒需要的良种），也都需要直接向农业社和国营农场挑选，而且要按种子的品类分别储存，以便在播种以前及时运到和分发，这是一系列的农业科学技术和组织工作。同时，优良品种的推广工作，同改变耕作栽培制度、种植高产作物和防治病虫害等增产措施是密切结合的。因此，这项工作必须有计划、有准备地进行。
    目前种子的业务是由农业、粮食两部门分工管理的。农业部门管理种子的计划、繁育、试验和推广工作；粮食部门根据农业部门的计划，办理收购、保管、调运和供应等项业务。这种分工管理的办法只是一种过渡性的办法，工作当中发生的问题很多。
    自去年秋季起，全国各地进行农业生产规划，许多地区对推广优良种子，要求非常迫切，要求推广的品种既多，调拨的数量又大，调拨的时间很急，运输路线又长，而产地过去并没有优良种子的储备，结果各地调拨的种子很乱，经常发生调而不用，调多用少，供不应求或品种、质量不对头的情况；而且往往引起若干事故，使国家在经济上和政治上都受到损失。例如，1955年秋季，安徽、江西、湖南、广西等省，由于扩大了蚕豆豌豆冬播的任务，本省收购的数量不能满足需要，八月间派人到湖北省商品粮库中临时选调，当时湖北省库存的蚕豆和豌豆一般都有虫子，因为各省急需下种，忽视虫害，检验马虎，匆忙调走蚕豆和豌豆种子共有二千二百万斤，后来这些豆种运到各省，不仅不能作种，而且还传播了虫害。又如，用黑龙江省的马铃薯移地种植，产量很高，今年辽宁、山东、广东、河北、安徽、河南、福建、北京、天津等九省、市要求黑龙江省供应薯种达五亿斤，黑龙江省可能供应一亿到二亿斤，而黑龙江地区天气冷得较早，从马铃薯收获到上冻只有四、五十天的时间，调运时间紧迫，数量巨大；过去经验证明，即使采用装运水果一样的办法装运，但途中大量冻伤或腐烂还是很难避免的。再如，今年河南、河北、江苏、安徽等主要产麦省小麦受了灾害，当年生产的小麦大部分质量不合种子标准，各地平时没有麦种的储备，临时要由陕西、四川及其他省市调入六亿斤以上的麦种（四川去年小麦收成较好，陕西虽然也受灾，但旧存小麦良种较多），加上从省内商品粮库存中挑选小麦种子共达十五亿斤。这样大量的麦种，都是仓卒从各地商品小麦中临时挑选的，检验仓促，种子质量很难保证，加以调运时间紧迫，有的地方很可能在播种时期不能及时运到。
    这些情况说明，种子管理的方法，必须进一步改善，才能够适应粮食增产的要求。为此，我提出如下几点建议：
    一、对优良的种子推广工作必须进行全面的具体的规划。建议农业部门根据需要与可能提出分区分品种的年度推广计划和种子储存计划，这样才能事先作好准备，安排收购、调运和保管工作，克服临时忙乱、盲目调拨的缺点。
    二、逐步建立备荒、开荒种子的储备制度。农业合作社每年应当储存一定数目的良种。全国应当指定若干地区从商品粮中挑选一定数目的良种分库专门储存，定期进行轮换，保持种子的质量，以保证灾区和开荒种子的需要。
    三、优良种子（包括备荒和开荒的种子），从繁育、选购到供应，建议由农业部门统一管理，建立专管机构经办业务。目前农业部门的困难是没有资金、仓库和业务人员，粮食部门应当划出一部分仓库和资金，并配备收购、调运、保管、供应的业务干部（农业技术干部由农业部门配备），先把机构建立起来，使购、运、销、保管等项业务有了头绪后，再移转农业部门管理。种子专管机构可以作为事业机构，单独进行核算。选购的种子可以顶粮食统购任务，也可以拿粮食与农业合作社等量交换。
