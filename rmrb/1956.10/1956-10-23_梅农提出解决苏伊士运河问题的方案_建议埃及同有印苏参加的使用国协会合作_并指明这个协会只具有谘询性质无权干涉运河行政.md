Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd dispatch: According to a France-Presse report from Cairo, the "Al-Gomhuria" newspaper reported on October 21st that Indian Minister Without Portfolio, Menon, presented a solution to the Suez Canal problem to Egypt.

"Al-Gomhuria" said: Menon suggested that the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority recognize and closely cooperate with an expanded association of canal user nations, including India and the Soviet Union.

"Al-Gomhuria" said that Menon also suggested that Egypt, based on the recommendations of the United Nations, appoint three senior officials to the Canal Authority.

The newspaper said that Menon suggested that the expanded association of user nations include the major users of the Suez Canal, and also ensure geographical representation. He believed that the association of user nations could include: France, Britain, the United States, Egypt, India, Australia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, and Latin America.

"Al-Gomhuria" said that, according to Menon's plan, the association of canal user nations would only have consultative status and would not interfere with the administration of the canal.

"Al-Gomhuria" said that Menon's proposal was made during his visit to Cairo for talks with President Nasser. This plan contains seven "suggestions" and an introduction reaffirming the six principles for solving the Suez Canal problem unanimously adopted by the United Nations Security Council.

The seven "suggestions" are:

(1) The 1888 Convention of Constantinople, which guarantees freedom of navigation on the canal, should be affirmed, but certain provisions of the convention should be amended. Egypt will submit annual reports on the canal to the United Nations, and the new convention will be registered with the United Nations. The International Court of Justice in The Hague will arbitrate any differences of opinion that may arise from the interpretation of this convention.

(2) The issue of compensation to the shareholders of the Suez Canal Company after Egypt nationalized the company, as well as other "claims" against Egypt, will be resolved through arbitration.

(3) Egypt will recognize the expanded association of user nations.

(4) Fees for ships passing through the canal shall not be increased until an agreement is reached on the use and management of the canal. If no agreement can be reached, the matter shall be resolved through arbitration.

(5) In the event of "any unfair treatment," the plaintiff shall first lodge a complaint with the Canal Authority itself, then with the Egyptian courts or the association of user nations, and finally with arbitration.

(6) Publish a "Canal Statute" containing rules for the use and management of the canal.

(7) Egypt will appoint the most qualified experts, based on the recommendations of the United Nations, to the three main positions in the Canal Authority.

    梅农提出解决苏伊士运河问题的方案
    建议埃及同有印苏参加的使用国协会合作
    并指明这个协会只具有谘询性质无权干涉运河行政
    新华社22日讯　据法新社开罗消息，“共和国报”10月21日报道说，印度不管部长梅农向埃及提出了一个解决苏伊士运河问题的方案。
      “共和国报”说：梅农建议埃及苏伊士运河管理局承认并且同包括印度和苏联在内的一个扩大了的运河使用国协会密切合作。
      “共和国报”说，梅农还建议由埃及根据联合国的推荐任命运河管理局的三个高级官员。
    这家报纸说，梅农建议扩大了的使用国协会包括苏伊士运河的主要使用国，并且还要保证具有地理上的代表性，他认为使用国协会可以包括：法国、英国、美国、埃及、印度、澳洲、东南亚、中东、东欧、南欧和拉丁美洲。
      “共和国报”说，根据梅农的计划，运河使用国协会只具有谘询的性质，它不能干涉运河的行政。
      “共和国报”说，梅农的方案是他在这一次到开罗同纳赛尔总统会谈的时候提出的。这个方案包含七点“建议”和一篇重新肯定联合国安全理事会一致通过的解决苏伊士运河问题的六项原则的引言。
    那七项“建议”是：
      （一）应该确认保证运河航行自由的1888年君士坦丁堡公约，但是这个公约的某些条款应该予以修改。埃及将每年向联合国提出关于运河的报告，新的公约将在联合国备案。设在海牙的国际法院将仲裁可能由于对这种公约的解释而引起的任何意见分歧。
      （二）关于埃及将苏伊士运河公司收归国有以后对公司股东的赔偿问题，以及其他对埃及的“要求”，将由仲裁解决。
      （三）埃及将承认那个扩大了的使用国协会。
      （四）船只通过运河的费用在运河的使用与管理之间达成协议以前不得增加，遇到不能达成协议时，问题由仲裁解决。
      （五）遇有“任何待遇不公”的情况，原告将首先向运河管理局本身提出控诉，然后向埃及法庭或使用国协会提出控诉，最后由仲裁解决。
      （六）公布一个包含使用和管理运河的规则的“运河章程”。
      （七）埃及将根据联合国的推荐任命最有资格的专家担任运河管理局的三个主要职务。
