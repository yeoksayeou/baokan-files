Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 13th: Hong Kong, 8:00 PM today: The situation on Hong Kong Island tonight appears tense. Reports indicate that over a thousand thugs have crossed the sea from Kowloon to Hong Kong, and they are threatening to attack "Ta Kung Pao" and "Wen Wei Po".

According to reliable sources, gasoline has been transported into buildings near Wen Wei Po in cars. Simultaneously, there are threats that "Pui Kiu Middle School will be in danger".

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 13th: Hong Kong, 3:00 PM today: The riots in the Kowloon urban area have not been completely quelled, and sporadic disturbances continue in certain locations. Since last night, the special agent thugs have shifted their activities to remote areas.

As of noon today, martial law remains in effect in the Kowloon urban area and the suburban areas of Tsuen Wan and Sham Tseng.

At midnight this morning, a large number of thugs stormed into the Kowloon Walled City, looting residents' property. Residents were unable to resist and allowed the thugs to plunder. Only when armed British police officers arrived on the scene did the thugs scatter, shouting. At 7:25 AM this morning, the seventh zone of the King's Park Resettlement Area, near Ho Man Tin in the northwestern part of the Kowloon Peninsula, was set on fire by thugs. The residence of the resettlement area's director was stormed and set ablaze. In the Kowloon City area, thugs continue to force passersby and shops to purchase Kuomintang flags.

Near the Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch office in the Tsim Sha Tsui area, many special agent thugs were lying in ambush throughout the night in the streets and alleys near the office and in the dark corners of buildings. Due to police patrols and vigilance, the thugs did not take action.

The Great Wall Movie Enterprise and the Motion Picture & General Investment Co. Ltd. on Hau Wong Road in Kowloon City were vandalized by thugs on the night of October 12th, suffering significant losses. The Motion Picture & General Investment Co. Ltd. was again disrupted by thugs today. The figures directing the thugs to vandalize the film studios openly declared: "Our mission is to destroy."

At 8:30 PM on the evening of October 12th, a disturbance briefly occurred in front of the Ta Kung Pao office on Connaught Road in Central District, Hong Kong. The police dispersed a group of unidentified people gathered near the newspaper office when police cars arrived. Subsequently, disturbances directed by Kuomintang special agents also occurred in Tuen Mun, near Castle Peak in the Kowloon suburbs.

The Hong Kong and Kowloon Trades Union Council sent representatives to meet with the Commissioner of Police in Hong Kong on October 12th regarding the Kuomintang special agents' creation of disturbances in Kowloon, raising four demands, including the necessity to stop the disturbances and ensure public order.

By early this morning, Hong Kong police began searching in various areas of Kowloon, arresting approximately one thousand people. Some of those arrested still had strips of cloth tied to their arms, marking them as participants in the riots.

The new school building of Heung To Middle School, which was set on fire again by thugs yesterday afternoon, is estimated to have suffered losses of approximately HK$770,000, including HK$15,000 in cash. The entire four-story building of the new school was burned down.

This afternoon, public buses on all lines in the Kowloon area still have not resumed service. Trains from the Kowloon Tsim Sha Tsui station to Guangzhou remain suspended this afternoon.

Schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon remain closed today.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 13th: Hong Kong, 8:00 PM today: Kowloon residents are still spending today in unease and fear. Although martial law has been lifted in the southern downtown area of Tsim Sha Tsui, it continues in Mong Kok, Sham Shui Po, and the suburban areas north of Waterloo Road. Ferry traffic between Kowloon and Hong Kong has partially resumed, but due to the past three days of riots and transportation disruptions, there is a shortage of food and vegetables, and it is unlikely that the accumulated garbage and excrement will be cleared in the short term.

This afternoon, the southern part of Kowloon was quiet, but there were still disturbances by thugs in individual areas in the north.

    传闻千余名暴徒潜入香港
    九龙地区个别地点仍有骚动
    新华社广州13日电　香港今日下午八时消息：香港岛方面今晚情况呈现紧张。有消息说，有一千多名暴徒已从九龙渡海到了香港，他们扬言要袭击“大公报”和“文汇报”。
    据确实消息说，在文汇报附近建筑物内，有汽车运入汽油。同时，又有人扬言，“培侨学校将遭危险”。
    新华社广州13日电　香港今日下午三时消息：九龙市区的骚乱还没有被完全制止，个别地点仍有骚动。从昨天晚上开始，特务暴徒们已经转到偏僻地区活动。
    到今日午间，九龙市区和郊区荃湾、深井等地仍在戒严中。
    今晨零时，有大批暴徒涌到九龙城砦，抢劫居民的财物，居民无法抵抗，任暴徒洗劫。直到武装的英国警员开到现场时，暴徒才呼叫奔散。今晨七时二十五分，临近九龙半岛西北部何文田区的京士柏徙置区第七区民房，被暴徒放火焚烧。这个徙置区区长的住宅，被暴徒冲入放火焚烧。九龙城城街道一带，仍有暴徒强迫路人、商店购买国民党旗。
    尖沙咀区新华社香港分社附近，昨夜通宵有特务暴徒多人埋伏在社址附近的横街小巷和建筑物的暗角里。因警察巡逻戒备，暴徒们没有采取行动。
    九龙城候王道的长城影片厂、万里影片厂12日晚间被暴徒捣毁，损失甚大。万里影片厂今日又遭暴徒捣乱。指挥暴徒捣毁影片厂的人物公开声言：“我们的任务是破坏”。
    12日晚上八点三十分，香港中区干诺道区大公报社门前曾一度发生骚乱。后因警车开到，才把啸聚报社附近一群不明身份的人驱散。在这以后，九龙郊区青山附近的屯门，也曾经发生有国民党特务指挥骚动。
    港九工会联合会为国民党特务分子在九龙制造骚乱事，12日曾派出代表往见香港警务处长，提出必须制止骚乱、确保治安秩序等四项要求。
    到今天凌晨，香港警察开始分别在九龙的一些地区搜捕，共逮捕了约一千人。这些被捕的人中间有的在臂上还缠着参加骚乱时作为标志的布条。
    昨天下午被暴徒再度放火焚烧的香岛中学新校舍，估计损失约七十七万元，其中现款一万五千元。新校舍的四层大厦全部被烧光。
    今天午后，九龙地区各线公共汽车仍然没有开出。由九龙尖沙咀车站到广州的火车在午后仍然停驶。
    港九各校今日继续停课。
    新华社广州13日电　香港今日下午八时消息：九龙居民今天仍在不安和惊恐中度过。虽然南部闹区尖沙咀一带已解除戒严，但窝打老道以北的旺角，深水埗和郊区一带仍继续戒严。九龙和香港间的轮渡交通已局部恢复，但由于过去三天的骚乱和交通停顿，粮食和蔬菜均感缺乏，堆积的垃圾和粪便难望短期内清除。
    今日下午，九龙南部地区沉寂，但北部个别地区仍有暴徒骚乱。
