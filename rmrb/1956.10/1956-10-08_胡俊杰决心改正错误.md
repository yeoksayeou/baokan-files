Hu Junjie, a cadre from the Rural Work Department of the CPC Nanchang County Committee in Hunan Province, wrote: The article "The Emperor of the Agricultural Cooperative" published on page 3 of the People's Daily on July 5th criticizes me. The examples cited in the article are basically consistent with the facts, and the criticisms are very correct. They have been of great educational help to me, and I am determined to correct my mistakes.

My lack of in-depth work in the Shatan Agricultural Cooperative, my large-scale operations, and my "patriarchal" leadership style are mainly rooted in the following: ① Last year, during the overall planning and trial construction of advanced cooperatives in Shatan Township, the work proceeded relatively smoothly due to the correct leadership of the higher-level party. Therefore, I became dizzy with victory. I did not humbly consider the opinions of others, and even refused criticism, trying in every possible way to cover up my mistakes. ② My understanding of running cooperatives thriftily was insufficient. I mistakenly believed that since we had transitioned to advanced cooperatives and were a key cooperative led by the county party committee, I should try to put on a socialist facade everywhere, wasting a lot of the cooperative's manpower, materials, and financial resources. ③ Lack of in-depth work and paternalistic intervention were also important sources of my mistakes.

The mistakes I made in the Shatan Agricultural Cooperative caused considerable losses to the Shatan Cooperative and had a very bad impact on the masses, which in turn affected the Party's prestige among the masses. In addition to making a public self-criticism to your newspaper, I have also requested the higher-level party to give me the punishment I deserve.

    胡俊杰决心改正错误
    中共湖南省南昌县委农村工作部的干部胡俊杰来信说：人民日报7月5日三版刊载的“农业社里的太上皇”所批评的就是我，文章中所举的事例基本上都符合事实，提出的批评也很正确，对我的教育帮助很大，我决心纠正自己的错误。
    我在沙潭农业社工作不深入，摆大摊子和存在“家长”式的领导作风，主要根源是：①去年在沙潭乡进行合作化全面规划与试建高级社时，由于上级党正确的领导，工作进行得较为顺利，因此便被胜利冲昏了头脑。对别人意见不虚心考虑，甚至还拒绝批评，多方设法掩盖自己的错误。②对勤俭办社认识不足，错误地认为转了高级社，而且又是县委领导的重点社，便处处设法想摆起社会主义架子来，浪费了社里不少的人力、物力和财力。③工作不深入，包办代替也是我犯错误的一个重要根源。
    我在沙潭农业社所犯的错误，给沙潭社带来了不少的损失，在群众中的影响也极坏，并且由此影响了党在群众中的威信。我除了向你报作出公开检讨外，并已经请求上级党给了我应得的处分。
