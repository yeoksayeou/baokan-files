    “Hospitable” Hosts
    The leaders of the Xinhua Bookstore Sichuan Branch are extremely "hospitable." Whenever there is an opportunity, they throw lavish banquets to welcome or see off guests. For example, when advanced book distribution workers went to Beijing for a meeting, the branch held a grand banquet to see them off; when they returned, another banquet was held to welcome them back. When the branch's cadre training class started and ended, the manager and section chiefs would also have a meal together.
    The banquets they held had one characteristic: few guests and many hosts. In the aforementioned banquets to see off and welcome advanced workers, there were only eight or nine guests, but more than twenty hosts. It was not enough for the managers and section chiefs at home to attend the banquet; even section chiefs who were temporarily participating in central work outside had to be called back to accompany the guests. People therefore suspect that they are probably not truly "hospitable," but are taking the opportunity to have a good meal.

    The Woes of Translation
    I work in translation. Although most of what I studied was related to military affairs, I was assigned to work in the industrial sector after I started working. Not only that, my job has been transferred nine times in the past three years. Each time I was transferred, the leaders euphemistically called it "urgent need," but in fact it was not always
  “urgent need.” For example, in 1955, the leaders transferred me to the Northeast, saying that the work there was waiting for me, and I was so anxious that I went to work in the Northeast before even completing the formalities. Who knew that when I entered the office, there was nothing to do. Two months passed, and I only did a little proofreading. On average, I worked less than three hours a day for half a year, which was really boring.
    In recent years, the inconsistency between what I learned and what I do, coupled with frequent transfers, has brought me a lot of difficulties in my work. As far as I know, some of my colleagues have had worse experiences at work than I have. I hope that all government agencies and units will attach importance to the training of translation cadres and rationally arrange their work.

### 群众呼声

专栏：群众呼声

    “好客”的主人
    新华书店四川分店的领导同志十分“好客”，一有机会，就大摆宴席欢迎或欢送客人。如先进图书发行工作者赴京开会，该店就举行盛宴欢送；他们回来了，又设宴洗尘。该店干部训练班开学和结业，经理和科长也都要聚餐一次。
    他们所举行的宴会有一个特点，就是客人少主人多。前面所说的欢送和欢迎先进工作者的宴会，只有八、九个客人，但主人就有二十多个。在家的经理和科长参加宴会还不算，就是暂时到外边参加中心工作的科长，也要被调回来作陪客。人们因此怀疑，他们恐怕不是真正“好客”，而是借机饱餐一顿。
    活力
    翻译的苦恼
    我是从事翻译工作的，虽然我所学的东西大部分都是有关军事方面的，可是，我参加工作后却被分配到工业部门去做翻译。不仅如此，三年来，我的工作还被调动过九次。每次调动工作时，领导上都美其名为“急需”，但是，事实上并不都是
  “急需”的。如1955年领导上调我去东北时，说那里工作在等我，急得我到东北连手续还没有办完就去工作，谁知进了办公室却没事做。两个月过去了，才做了一点校对工作。半年里平均每天工作还不到三个小时，真是闲得使人厌烦。
    几年来，由于学用不一致，又加上频繁的调动，给我在工作上带来了不少的困难。据我所知，我的同行有些人在工作上的遭遇，还不如我。我希望各机关单位，重视培养翻译干部，合理安排他们的工作。
