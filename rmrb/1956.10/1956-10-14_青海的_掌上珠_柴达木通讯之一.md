Qinghai's "Pearl in the Palm"
-- Chai Da Mu Communication 1
By our reporter

That day, the sky was cloudless. We took a car from Lanzhou to Xining, heading towards Chai Da Mu. The car moved forward along the Lanzhou-Qinghai highway. Passing Letu County, we encountered a rare good scene on the plateau. The car sped through avenues of poplars, and looking out the window, there was an endless green arched corridor ahead. The Huangshui River babbled beside us, sometimes on the left, then suddenly on the right. In the river valley, there were large forests and grasslands, and the branches of many fruit trees were bent down by red fruits. This was a busy transportation route, with an average of one car passing every one minute and forty-eight seconds, day and night. From many drivers, I learned that many people were busy for Chai Da Mu, and many cars were driving for Chai Da Mu.

Xining, with a vibrant appearance, met me for the first time. This ancient city surrounded by green trees and rivers, like the entire Qinghai, had experienced suffering and was now moving from rebirth to prosperity. In the past, a folk song tragically sang: "The Ma (Bufang) family's Qinghai has no sun, grains and flowers do not grow, the people eat bran and chaff, Ma Bufang drinks human soup every day." Today, everything has changed! A large number of houses have been built around Xining, some huge building projects are under construction, and many factories are being renovated and expanded. This year's construction investment has increased eighteenfold compared to last year. In the past, there were only 70,000 people here, now there are more than 170,000. Joy has replaced sorrow, and Xining, like the entire Qinghai, is marching forward on a road to the sun and happiness.

To wait for a car, I stayed in Xining. I heard that it was difficult to eat green vegetables in the basin, so at nine o'clock one evening, I went to the department store to buy canned vegetables and found pickled cucumbers. I wanted to buy a few more cans. Unfortunately, this batch of goods had just arrived and the price had not been set, so the salesperson said they could not be sold. I became a little anxious.

"Comrade, I am going to Chai Da Mu, where it is not easy to buy such good vegetables. Can you sell me a few cans?" I said in an almost pleading tone.

"You are going to Chai Da Mu?" the salesperson quickly asked.

"Yes, I'm afraid there won't be any green vegetables to eat there."

"The price hasn't been set, what can I do!" He said, walking back and forth in the room, looking uneasy.

"Can you estimate a price and sell me a few cans first? I'll leave you my mailing address, and we can settle the difference after the price is set, okay?"

"When are you leaving?" He hesitated for a moment after hearing my words and asked me.

"Tomorrow morning."

He became uneasy, constantly pacing back and forth, looking troubled, and thinking hard. Later, he actually agreed to my request. When I expressed my gratitude to him, he said it was completely unnecessary and that it was their duty. He also told me that as long as the store's doors were not closed and people were not asleep, anyone from Chai Da Mu or going to Chai Da Mu could buy anything, and all the stores were like that. From his tone, I could hear that he was trying his best to show that he was also participating in the development of Chai Da Mu!

On the way back, I kept thinking about this matter. What force made this clerk so love the Chai Da Mu Basin? Later, from conversations with many comrades, I learned that it was because of the richness of Chai Da Mu.

The Chai Da Mu Basin is 800 kilometers long from east to west and 320 kilometers wide at its widest point from north to south. The total area of the basin is more than 220,000 square kilometers. According to geologists' evidence based on biological fossils, this was originally an inland lake with a mild climate. After several orogenic movements, it formed a basin, losing its regulation with the ocean climate, making the local climate hot and dry. For a very, very long time, no one cared whether there were treasures here or not. The rulers of the past were accustomed to sucking blood and sweat from the people, so naturally they didn't bother to see through the secrets beneath this land. Therefore, this place was abandoned and became a happy home for wild horses, gazelles, and other wild animals. However, imperialists in the last hundred years well understood the value of this land. The Swede Sven Hedin secretly surveyed many topographic maps in our Northwest three times from 1893 to 1897 under the guise of travel, and also investigated the geological conditions of the Qinghai region. After returning to his country, he sold these materials to the German Geographical Society at a high price.

As soon as New China was founded, we began the work of surveying and developing Chai Da Mu. Large-scale exploration work began in 1955! At this time, petroleum and geological exploration personnel had traversed more than 100,000 square kilometers of land in the basin and found nearly 100 oil structures. Most of these structures are well-closed and large-area structural groups, and some structural areas are as large as 1,200 square kilometers, which is rare in the world. The oil gushing phenomenon in the exploration wells in the Mangya and Lenghu exploration areas tells people that not only is there oil here, but it is also likely to become a large oil field. Our geologists have also found iron, various non-ferrous and rare metals, coal, borax, asbestos, barite, crystal, and extremely rich salt lakes and salt mines in the mountains around the basin. The various mineral deposits of Chai Da Mu are no longer sleeping! Here, it is not only expected to become a base for the fuel industry, but also expected to become one of the metallurgical and chemical industrial bases. Therefore, the people of Qinghai call the Chai Da Mu Basin a "peerless rich man" and "pearl in the palm."

The secret of the underground treasures of the Chai Da Mu Basin has been revealed, just like the secrets of the underground in the Hexi Corridor and Karamay areas have been revealed, showing the new life of the industrial economy in the great Northwest of the motherland. I think this is probably the fundamental reason why that clerk treated me so warmly. No, it's more than that. Later, when I visited Comrade Chen Sigong, Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, I learned that the positive role that the Chai Da Mu Basin played in the minds of the people of Qinghai was even more than I had imagined. He told me: "Because of the discovery of oil and other mineral deposits in Chai Da Mu, it was decided at the Party Congress in July that the focus of the province's Party work would shift from agriculture and animal husbandry to industry." He also told me: "Most of the cadres in Qinghai come from other provinces. At one time, some cadres felt that Qinghai's industry was backward and were not at ease in their work, and wanted to go elsewhere to participate in industrial construction. Now, the situation is different. Because of Chai Da Mu, the morale of the cadres is not only stable, but they also actively demand to be transferred to the basin and are willing to do any kind of work."

The mood of some cadres mentioned by Comrade Chen Sigong is understandable. The Party's policy of socialist industrialization is changing the economic face of our country. New cities, new industrial bases, and new modern factories have appeared on the vast land of the motherland. Industry controls the fate of our country. However, in the past few years, Qinghai's economic development has been mainly based on agriculture and animal husbandry, and no large industries have been established. In the 1956 budget for economic development, although the expenditure for developing local industries increased by 4.42 times, the expenses requiring central assistance still accounted for 64.97% of the total expenditure, an increase of 165.8% over the previous year. This is why the cadres and people of Qinghai particularly yearn for the development of industry. Today, the Chai Da Mu Basin has precisely given the possibility of realizing this desire and has opened up a path to changing Qinghai's economic outlook.

Chai Da Mu, this resounding name, not only attracts the people of Qinghai to actively sign up to go to the basin to build roads, build houses, and do all kinds of work; at the same time, it also attracts people from all over the country to come to Qinghai. On the streets and in the shops of Xining, you can meet people who have just come from Guangdong, Sichuan, Hubei, Shanghai, Shandong, Beijing, Liaoning and other places. Among them, there are postal workers, car drivers, sewing workers, housing construction experts, barbers, master chefs, drillers, and shop assistants. Some are waiting for a car to go to Chai Da Mu, and some are working in Xining.

Today's Chai Da Mu is the pearl in the hearts of the people of Qinghai, the signal of Qinghai's economic prosperity, the suite in the "Development of the Great Northwest Symphony," and the great display of the motherland's abundant treasures. With this impression, on September 3, I took a car from Xining to the Chai Da Mu Basin! In the first sixty kilometers of the journey, most of the route was along mountains and rivers. I was happy, I felt that every scenery was kind, including the Sun and Moon Mountain, which was regarded as an ominous omen. Sun and Moon Mountain is ninety kilometers away from Xining, 3,500 meters above sea level. In the past, there was a saying that "After passing Sun and Moon Mountain, tears never dry." It is said that this sentence has two origins: one is that when Princess Wencheng of the Tang Dynasty married Qizong Nongzan, she lingered and did not want to move forward when she reached Sun and Moon Mountain, looked east at Chang'an, and shed tears; the other is that west of Sun and Moon Mountain, there are more grasslands and fewer people, which is not suitable for living, and only when it is unavoidable do people cross Sun and Moon Mountain to the west, hence the tears. Today, because Chai Da Mu is just ahead, everyone who passes through here can't help but change their words and sing: "After passing Sun and Moon Mountain, the further you go, the more you like it."

September 10, Chai Da Mu

    青海的“掌上珠”
    ——柴达木通讯之一
  　本报记者
    这天，空中万里无云。我们乘汽车，从兰州奔西宁，赶往柴达木。车沿着兰（州）青（海）公路前行。一过乐都县城便遇到高原上难得的好景致。汽车在夹道的白杨中间飞驶，从车窗向外看，前面是一条走不尽的绿色的拱形长廊。湟水在我们的旁边喧闹，一会在左边，忽而又跑到右边。河谷里，有大片的树林、草地，不少果树的枝头，被红色的果子压弯了。这是一条运输繁忙的公路，一昼夜间，平均一分四十八秒钟有一辆汽车通过。车轮扬起的黄色的烟雾，随风游荡。从不少司机同志口中，我知道在这条路上有许多人是为柴达木而奔忙、许多车子是为柴达木而开的。
    西宁，带着朝气勃勃的面貌和我初次相见了。这个被绿树和河水围绕着的古城，同整个青海一样，经历过苦难，也正在由新生走向繁荣。过去，有一首民歌凄惨地唱道：“马（步芳）家的青海无太阳，五谷花草长不长，百姓吃的麸皮糠，马步芳天天喝人汤。”今天，一切都变了！西宁的周围已建筑了大量房屋，一些巨大的楼房工程正在施工，不少的工厂在进行改建、扩建，今年建设投资比去年增加了十八倍。过去，这里只有七万人，现在有十七万多。欢乐代替了悲痛，西宁与整个青海一样，在一条通向太阳、幸福的路上昂首阔步地前进。
    为着等车，我在西宁住下了。我听说到了盆地吃不上青菜，一天晚上九点钟的时候，跑到百货公司去买蔬菜罐头，发现有酸黄瓜，想多买几筒。不巧，这批货刚到，没有订出售价，售货员说不能卖，我有些急了。
    “同志，我是去柴达木的，在那里不易买到这样好的菜，少卖给几筒可以吗？”我用近乎哀求的语气说道。
    “你是到柴达木去的？”那位售货员急忙追问。
    “是的，怕那里没有青菜吃。”
    “没有订价，怎么办呢！”说着，他在屋内走来走去，现出很不安的样子。
    “能不能估一个价钱，先卖几筒给我呢？我给你留下通讯地址，订出价钱以后，多退少补行不行？”
    “你什么时候走呢？”他听了我的话犹豫一会，问我。
    “明天早晨。”
    他不安了，不断地转来转去，现出一副为难的样子，用力思索着。后来，他竟答应了我的要求。当我向他表示感谢的时候，他说完全不必要这样，这是他们应尽的责任。他还告诉我说，只要商店的门不关，人没有睡觉，不管是柴达木来的还是向柴达木去的人，买什么东西都行，所有的商店都是这样的。从他的语气中，可以听到他极力表示自己也参加了开发柴达木的工作！
    在回来的路上，我一直想这件事。是什么力量使这位店员如此热爱柴达木盆地呢？后来，从许多同志的谈话中，才知道这是因为柴达木的富饶所引起的。
    柴达木盆地东西长八百公里，南北最宽处有三百二十公里，盆地的总面积达二十二万多平方公里。据地质人员根据生物化石证明，这里原是一个内湖，气候温和，经过几次造山运动以后，才形成了盆地，失掉了与海洋气候的调节，使当地的气候变得炎热、干旱了。在很长很长的年代里，这里有没有宝藏呢？是没有人过问的。历代的统治者，习惯于从人民身上吸吮血汗，自然用不着去识破这片土地下的秘密。因此，这块地方被遗弃了，变成了野马、黄羊等野兽快乐的家园。但是，近百年来帝国主义者很懂得这片土地存在的价值。瑞典人斯文赫定从1893年到1897年，曾三次在我国的大西北以旅行为名偷测了许多地形图，也对青海地区地质情形作了调查，回国以后把这些资料高价卖给了德国地舆学会。
    新中国一成立，我们就开始了勘查、开发柴达木的工作，大规模地勘探工作于1955年开始了！这时，石油、地质勘探人员，在盆地里踏遍了十余万平方公里的土地，找到了近百个石油构造。这些构造大都是圈闭好、面积大的构造群，有的构造面积竟达一千二百平方公里，是世界上少有的。芒崖、冷湖探区探井发生的喷油现象告诉人们：这里不但有油，而且有可能成为很大的油田。我们的地质人员们，还在盆地周围的山上找到了铁、各种有色金属和稀有金属、煤、硼砂、石绵、重晶石、水晶、储量异常丰富的盐湖和盐矿。柴达木的各种矿藏不再沉睡了！这里，不但有希望成为燃料工业的基地，而且有希望成为冶金、化学的工业基地之一。因此，青海人民把柴达木盆地称为“盖世富豪”和“掌上明珠”。
    柴达木盆地地下宝藏的秘密被揭破，正像河西走廊、克拉玛依地区地下秘密被揭破一样，显示了祖国大西北工业经济的新生。我想，这大概就是那位店员热情招待我的根本原因。不，还不止如此。后来，当我访问了中共青海省委书记陈思恭同志的时候，知道柴达木盆地在青海人民心目中所发生的积极作用更是我想不到的。他告诉我说：“由于在柴达木发现了石油和其他的矿藏，因而在7月的党代表会议上，决定全省党的工作重点由农牧业转向工业。”他还告诉我：“青海的干部大都是由外省来的。有一个时候，部分干部认为青海的工业落后，不安心工作，想到别处去参加工业建设。现在，情况不同了，因为有了柴达木，干部的情绪不但稳定了，而且积极要求把自己调到盆地去，愿意做任何一种工作”。
    陈思恭同志所说的某些干部的情绪，是可以理解的。党的社会主义工业化的方针，正在改变着我国的经济面貌。祖国幅员广大的土地上，出现了新的城市、新的工业基地、新的近代化工厂。工业左右着我们国家的命运。而几年来，青海的经济发展，一直是以农牧业为主，没有建立过大的工业。在1956年发展经济的预算中，虽然用于发展地方工业的支出增长了四点四二倍，然而需要中央辅助的费用还占支出总数的64.97％，比上一年增长165.8％。这就是青海的干部和人民特别向往发展工业的缘故。今天，柴达木盆地恰恰给予了实现这种愿望的可能，给改变青海的经济面貌开辟了一条道路。
    柴达木，这个响亮的名字，不但吸引着青海的人民，积极报名去盆地修路、筑房子、去做各种各样的工作；同时，也吸引着全国各地的人来到了青海。在西宁的街道上，商店里，可以碰到新从广东、四川、湖北、上海、山东、北京、辽宁等地来的人。他们中间，有的是邮递员、汽车司机、缝衣工人、盖房子的能手、理发师、做菜的大师傅、钻探工、店员。有的人在等车去柴达木，有的是在西宁工作。
    今日的柴达木，是青海人民心灵上的珍珠，是繁荣青海经济的信号，是“开发大西北交响乐”中的组曲，是祖国宝藏丰富的巨大显示。我就带着这种印象，在9月3日，乘车从西宁向柴达木盆地进发了！开始的六十公里的路途中，大都在傍山靠水的路上行进。我高兴，我觉得每一景色都是亲切的，连被人当作不祥之兆的日月山在内。日月山离西宁九十公里，拔海三千五百公尺，过去有“过了日月山，两眼泪不干”之说。听说这句话有两个来源：一个是，唐朝文成公主嫁给弃宗弄赞时，走至日月山时，徘徊不前，东望长安，洒泪而去；一个是日月山以西，草原多、人烟少，不适于生活，只有在不得已时才越日月山西行，故而流泪。今天，由于柴达木就在前面，所有从这里走过的人，都情不自禁地改口唱道：“过了日月山，愈走愈喜欢”。
               9月10日柴达木
