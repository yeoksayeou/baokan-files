Xinhua News Agency, October 1st dispatch from Paris: French Prime Minister Mollet, in a speech delivered in Roubaix, northern France, on September 30, once again emphasized that the Western Three Powers would never accept any plan other than "international control" of the Suez Canal, and insisted that Egypt had no right to nationalize the Canal Company.

Mollet repeated the untenable arguments consistently stated by the West on the Suez Canal issue, insisting that Egypt's sovereign act of nationalizing the Canal Company was a "deliberate violation of international law." According to him, based on the 1888 Convention, the former Canal Company possessed "international character," and the Egyptian government had no right to change this character. He believed that the existence of the former Suez Canal Company was "one of the guarantees of free navigation" of the canal.

Mollet firmly opposed Egypt exercising its sovereignty over the canal, saying, "Once any country controls the management organization [of the canal], it will easily obstruct the passage of ships from any country." If Egypt becomes the "absolute master of the canal," then canal users would be subjected to "pressure" and "extortion." Although he had to admit that Egypt had not done these things so far, he still deliberately emphasized that there was such a "threat" in the future.

Mollet then said, "I can state definitively that international management of the canal is the only solution acceptable to the United States, Britain, and France."

When talking about the decision of Britain and France to submit the Suez issue to the Security Council, Mollet emphasized that in resolving the Suez issue, the use of peaceful methods must not be separated from the "principles of international law" recognized by the West, the latter being nothing more than a synonym for the "international control" of the canal principle repeatedly insisted upon by British and French officials. Mollet finally expressed opposition to "accepting the fait accompli [of the canal nationalization]," saying that "appeasement" measures should not be taken on the Suez issue simply to maintain peace.

    摩勒叫嚷西方三国只接受“国际管制”办法
    重弹旧调硬说埃及无权把运河公司收归国有　　
    据新华社1日讯　巴黎消息：法国总理摩勒9月30日在法国北部的鲁贝发表的演说中又一次强调西方三国决不接受“国际管制”苏伊士运河以外的任何计划，并且硬说埃及无权把运河公司收归国有。　　
    摩勒重复西方在苏伊士运河问题上一贯申述的不能成立的论据，硬说埃及把运河公司收归国有的主权行动是“故意破坏国际法”。据他说，根据1888年公约，前运河公司具有“国际性质”，而埃及政府无权改变这种性质。他认为前苏伊士运河公司的存在是运河“自由通航的保障之一”。　　
    摩勒坚决反对埃及行使它对运河的主权，他说，“任何国家一旦控制了（运河）管理机构以后，就很容易阻碍任何国家的船只通过”，假如埃及成为“运河的绝对主人”，那么运河使用国就会受到“压力”和“讹诈”。他虽然不得不承认到现在为止埃及并没有做这些事，但是他仍然故意强调前途存在着这种“威胁”。　　
    摩勒接着说，“我可以确定：国际管理运河是唯一能够为美国、英国和法国所接受的解决办法”。　　
    摩勒在谈到英法决定把苏伊士问题提交安全理事会一事时强调说，在解决苏伊士问题时，使用和平方法决不能同西方所认定的“国际法原则”分离开来，而后一点不过是英法官方一再坚持的“国际管制”运河原则的代名词。摩勒最后表示反对“接受（运河国有化的）既成事实”，他说，不能仅仅为了维持和平而在苏伊士问题上采取“姑息手段”。
