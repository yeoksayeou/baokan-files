Yugoslav Federal Executive Council Vice President Says
Yugoslavia Possesses Uranium Resources

    This newspaper reports that Yugoslav Federal Executive Council Vice President Svetozar Vukmanović recently announced that Yugoslavia possesses uranium resources, and that Yugoslavia's research achievements in nuclear science will be used to promote the country's further economic development. He said that many coal mines in Yugoslavia contain uranium, and that some mineral deposits with large reserves also contain uranium of a lower concentration. These deposits will be mined. Nuclear raw materials uranium and thorium have also been found in bauxite, of which Yugoslavia has very rich reserves. He said that uranium and thorium stored in coal and bauxite will be given priority for mining.
    Vukmanović made these remarks at the recently concluded Yugoslav expert meeting on the application of atomic energy to generate electricity. Vukmanović pointed out that it is now necessary to survey all power resources and conduct research on how to apply atomic energy to the economy. Speaking of hydropower, he pointed out that Yugoslavia has huge hydropower resources - capable of generating 60 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. Therefore, it is one of the countries in Europe with the richest hydropower resources. Developing and utilizing these hydropower resources to generate electricity can not only meet Yugoslavia's own needs, but also export electricity to neighboring countries such as Hungary, Italy, and Germany.

    南联邦执委会副主席说
    南斯拉夫拥有铀矿资源
    本报讯　南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会副主席斯·伏克曼诺维奇最近宣布说，南斯拉夫拥有铀的资源，同时南斯拉夫在核子科学方面的研究成果将利用来促进本国经济的进一步发展。他说，南斯拉夫的许多煤矿中都含有铀，此外，还有一些储藏量很大的矿物中间也含有成分较低的铀。这些矿床将要被开采。在南斯拉夫储量很富的铁矾土中也发现了核子原料铀和钍。他说，储藏在煤和铁矾中的铀和钍将被优先开采。
    伏克曼诺维奇这番话是在最近闭幕的南斯拉夫专家讨论应用原子能来发电的会议上说的。伏克曼诺维奇指出，现在必须在勘测一切电力资源的同时，进行如何把原子能应用于经济中的研究工作。他在谈到水力发电时指出，南斯拉夫拥有巨大的水力资源——每年可以发电六百亿瓩时。因此，它是欧洲水力资源最富的国家之一。开发和利用这些水力资源来发电，不但可以满足南斯拉夫本国的需要，而且还可以把电力输出到邻近的国家如匈牙利、意大利和德国去。
