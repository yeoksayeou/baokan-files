Actively Promote the Development of Local Specialty Production
Zhang Qilong, Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives

Local specialties currently account for about 20% of the total income of farmers in our country. They are an important source of income for farmers' regular lives. Especially when major crops suffer poor harvests, they play a more important role in stabilizing farmers' production and lives.

Local specialties also occupy a fairly important position in the national economy. They are not only consumer goods needed by the broad masses of urban and rural people, but also many varieties are industrial raw materials and export goods. Taking 1955 as an example, local specialties accounted for about 10% of China's total export value. In the future, with the growing needs of urban and rural people and the increasing demand in foreign markets, actively developing the production of local specialties will have even greater significance.

Since liberation, thanks to the continuous upsurge in farmers' production enthusiasm and the attention paid by party and government at all levels to the production and sales of local specialties, the output value of local specialties has generally increased in recent years. In 1955, it increased by about 20% compared with 1952. Many varieties have reached or even exceeded pre-war levels. The quantity operated by commercial departments in various places has also increased year by year. The procurement amount of supply and marketing cooperatives alone increased 1.9 times in 1955 compared with 1952. Achievements have been made in solving farmers' sales needs and supplying exports and the needs of urban and rural people.

However, in our work, in addition to certain side effects brought about by the transformation of rural private merchants, there are still many shortcomings and mistakes, mainly: In the past two years, the local specialty market has been managed too strictly and rigidly, with too much monopolization, and the due active role of small merchants and peddlers in operating local specialties has not been given attention; the changes in the division of business between state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives have been frequent, the organizational structure of supply and marketing cooperatives is unsound, and many supply and marketing cooperatives have not paid enough attention, or not enough attention, to the purchase of local specialties, so that some local specialties have not been purchased in a timely manner. Therefore, the rural local specialty market is not active enough, and the sales of many products have not been resolved. In addition, the purchase price is controlled too much, and the purchase price of some varieties is too low; in the early stage of the high tide of agricultural cooperation, attention was once relaxed on the arrangement of local and sideline product production because of focusing on increasing grain and cotton production. All these have affected the due development of the production of many local specialties, and even caused some local specialties to once reduce production, causing certain losses to the state and the people.

Based on the above situation, in order to further develop production and meet the needs of the state and the people, the following issues urgently need to be resolved:

First, according to the principle pointed out by Comrade Liu Shaoqi in his political report that "within a certain scope of a unified socialist market, the existence and a certain degree of development of a free market under state leadership are allowed as a supplement to the state market," the current market management method should be changed, and a part of the free market for local specialties should be opened up. Those major varieties related to exports and that must guarantee the supply needs of cities and industrial and mining areas should still be purchased by state-designated commercial departments in concentrated production areas in accordance with state plans and reasonable prices. The remaining majority of varieties should be allowed to be freely purchased and sold by local state-owned stores, supply and marketing cooperatives, cooperative stores, joint state-private stores, cooperative groups, and industrial and handicraft production departments, and actively guide and help farmers' trade.

For the remaining products that farmers cannot sell, the supply and marketing cooperatives should adopt consignment and storage methods to help farmers sell them, or be responsible for purchasing them. All those that are marketable, can be found to be marketable after a certain period of storage and effort, or can be sold after processing should be actively purchased; it is wrong not to actively purchase them. However, there are also some local specialties that cannot be used for a certain period of time, or whose quality is too poor to be used even after processing. Producers should be educated to temporarily stop production to avoid losses to the state and the people.

According to the instruction in Comrade Liu Shaoqi's political report that "part of our consumer goods must be exported in order to exchange for the machinery and equipment needed for industrial construction. For the sake of future happiness, we cannot but temporarily endure some difficulties in life," the sales of local specialties should strive for a greater quantity and better quality of local specialties for export as much as possible to support the country's industrial construction. Of course, some products that can take care of the needs of the place of origin and domestic sales, or are indispensable for domestic sales, such as medicinal materials, etc., must be given appropriate consideration.

Second, when agricultural production cooperatives comprehensively plan agricultural and sideline production, they must reasonably arrange the production of local specialties according to the specific conditions of each region, adapting to local conditions and adapting to the times. When arranging the production of local specialties, special attention should also be paid to distinguishing which varieties are suitable for collective operation by the cooperatives, which varieties are suitable for decentralized operation by cooperative members' families, or whether the cooperatives and cooperative members should both operate them. At the same time, the funds, labor time, fertilizers, and tools necessary for farmers' families to operate local specialties should also be taken care of as much as possible to give play to farmers' production enthusiasm.

Third, the price issue. It is wrong for us to control the price of local specialties too much and too rigidly with administrative methods. In the future, except for a few varieties, the purchase and sale prices of the remaining majority of freely purchased and sold varieties should not be controlled rigidly. When adjusting prices, the relevant departments should conduct investigations and research to adopt a method of mutual consultation and gradually adjust them in accordance with the state's price policy. Those current purchase prices that are too low should be appropriately increased, and transportation costs can be appropriately subsidized in remote areas. For products that are produced and sold locally, the difference between purchase and sale prices that is too large should be appropriately reduced, and the policy of pricing according to quality grades should be conscientiously implemented to correct the phenomenon of suppressing grades and prices. When the prices of freely purchased and sold products fluctuate too much, the commercial departments responsible for operation should adjust them through purchase and sale business, or the local party and government leaders should convene relevant departments to consult and adjust them.

Fourth, improve business management and improve work quality. First of all, we must correct the business thinking of some operating departments and some cadres. They should proceed from meeting the purchase and sale needs of the people everywhere, and correct the wrong thinking and practices of being afraid of trouble, rushing to do things that are profitable, and pushing away and ignoring things that are not profitable. We must minimize operating links, reduce circulation costs, and improve and improve operating techniques; boldly absorb and use old merchants who have experience in operating local specialties, especially technical personnel; and establish good working relationships with them, learn technology from them to improve business operations and technical levels, and patiently educate them to improve their ideological level and change their old style of work.

Processing business is closely related to the full utilization of local specialties, the improvement of value, and the good or bad sales. In the past, we have not done enough in this regard, and we should strengthen it in the future.

Our country has a vast territory and a large population, with a good climate, and the production of local specialties is decentralized, sporadic, and diverse. Most of them belong to household sideline businesses, so as long as our relevant policies such as prices, taxes, and market management meet the requirements of promoting and guiding production development, coupled with active purchase and sales, the production of local specialties will develop rapidly according to the needs of the state and the people. We believe that under the correct leadership of the party and the supervision and help of the people, this important work related to the development of the national economy, increasing farmers' income, and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives can be done well.

    积极促进小土产生产的发展
    中华全国供销合作总社副主任　张启龙
    小土产在我国农民的总收入中，目前约占20％左右，它是农民经常生活中的一项重要收入，特别是在主要农作物歉收的时候，它在安定农民的生产和生活方面更起着重要的作用。
    小土产在国民经济中也占着相当重要的地位，它不仅是广大城乡人民需要的消费品，而且很多品种又是工业原料和出口物资。以1955年为例，小土产在我国全部出口总额中约占10％左右。今后随着我国城乡人民生活需要的日益增长、国外市场需求的日益扩大，积极发展小土产的生产就具有更加重大的意义。
    解放以后，由于农民生产积极性的不断高涨，各级党政对小土产生产和销售的注意，几年来小土产的产值一般都有发展，1955年比1952年增加约在20％左右，不少品种业已达到甚至超过了战前水平。各地商业部门经营的数量也在逐年增加，仅供销合作社的采购额，1955年即比1952年增加一点九倍，在解决农民的销售要求、供应出口和城乡人民的需要上是有成绩的。
    但在我们工作中，除了对农村私商的改造曾带来某些副作用以外，也还存在着不少缺点和错误，主要是：近两年来，对小土产市场管得过严过死，包办劲大，没有注意发挥小商小贩经营小土产的应有的积极作用；国营商业同供销社之间业务分工的变化频繁，供销社机构不健全，不少供销合作社对收购小土产注意不够，或者很不够，以致若干小土产未能及时地收购起来。因此，农村小土产市场不够活跃，不少产品销路没有获得解决。加上收购价格管得过多，若干品种的收购价格偏低；农业合作化高潮到来初期，曾经因为集中力量搞粮棉增产，一度放松了土副产品生产的安排等。所有这些都影响了不少小土产生产应有的发展，甚至使某些小土产曾经一度减产，使国家和人民受到了一定的损失。
    根据上述情况，为了进一步发展生产，满足国家和人民的需要，目前急待解决的有下列几个问题：
    第一、根据刘少奇同志政治报告中所提示的“在统一的社会主义市场的一定范围内，允许国家领导下的自由市场的存在和一定程度的发展，作为国家市场的补充”的原则，应当改变现行的市场管理办法，开放一部分小土产的自由市场。凡是有关出口和必须保证城市、工矿区供应需要的若干主要品种，仍然由国家指定的商业部门在集中产区按照国家计划和合理价格进行收购，其余大多数品种，应该允许各地的国营商店、供销合作社、合作商店、公私合营商店、合作小组和工业、手工业生产等部门自由收购、自由运销，并且积极指导和帮助农民贸易。
    农民销售不出去的剩余产品，应当由供销合作社采取代销、代存的办法，帮助农民推销，或负责收购。凡是有销路的、储存一定时期经过努力可以找到销路的，或者经过加工可以销售的都应该积极地收购；不积极收购是不对的。但是也有些小土产，在一定时期内尚不能利用，或者质量太差经过加工还不能利用时，就应当教育生产者暂时停止生产，以免使国家和人民受到损失。
    小土产的销售，根据刘少奇同志政治报告中所提出“我们的一部分消费物资必须出口，以便换来工业建设所需要的机器装备。为了将来的幸福，我们不能不暂时忍受一些生活上的困难”的指示，应当尽可能地争取数量更多和质量更好的小土产出口，以支援国家工业建设。当然，有些产品凡是可以照顾产地和内销需要的，或是内销所不可缺少的，如药材等等，则必须加以适当照顾。
    第二、农业生产合作社在全面规划农副业生产的时候，必须根据各地区的具体情况，因地制宜、因时制宜地合理安排小土产的生产。在安排小土产生产的时候，还应该特别注意区别哪些品种适合社里集体经营，哪些品种适合社员家庭分散经营，或者社和社员都经营。同时，对农民家庭经营小土产所必需的资金、劳动时间和肥料、工具等，也应尽可能照顾，以发挥农民的生产积极性。
    第三、价格问题。我们用行政办法对小土产的价格管得太多太死，这是不对的。今后除少数品种外，对其余大多数自由购销的品种，不应该把购销价格管死。在调整价格的时候，各有关部门应该经过调查研究采取共同协商的办法，按照国家的价格政策，逐步地加以调整。凡现行收购价格偏低的，应该适当调高，边远地区还可以适当补贴运费。当地产当地销的产品，购销差价太大的，应该适当缩小，并且应该认真地贯彻执行按质分等论价的政策，纠正压级压价现象。自由购销的产品价格波动太大时，应该由负责经营的商业部门通过购销业务进行调剂，或者由当地党政领导召集有关部门互相协商，调整处理。
    第四、改善经营管理，提高工作质量。首先必须端正某些经营部门、某些干部的经营思想，应该是处处从满足人民的购销需要出发，纠正那些怕麻烦，有利抢着干，无利推开不管的错误思想和作法。必须尽量减少经营环节，降低流转费用，改进和提高经营技术；大胆地吸收和使用在经营小土产上有经验的旧商人，特别是技术人员；并且同他们搞好共事关系，向他们学习技术，以提高业务经营和技术水平，对他们耐心地进行教育，以提高他们的思想水平，改变他们的旧作风。
    加工业务对小土产的充分利用、价值的提高和销路的好坏，有着密切的关系，过去在这方面做得不够，今后应当加强。
    我国地大人多，气候好，而小土产的生产又是分散、零星、种类繁多，多数属于家庭副业，所以只要我们的价格、税收、市场管理等有关政策，符合于促进和指导生产发展的要求，再加上积极地收购和推销，小土产的生产就会按照国家和人民的需要很快地发展起来。我们相信，在党的正确领导和人民的监督、帮助下，对这一有关国民经济发展，增加农民收入和巩固农业生产合作社的重要工作，是能够做好的。
