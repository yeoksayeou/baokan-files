Looking at the Prospects of Sino-Japanese Trade from the Japanese Commodity Exhibition
Cao Zhongshu, Manager of China National Import and Export Corporation

The Japanese Commodity Exhibition has opened in Beijing. Visitors are very enthusiastic. This exhibition is large in scale with a wide variety of exhibits. It is a grand event in the history of Sino-Japanese trade, and it is also the largest exhibition ever held independently by Japan abroad. Judging from the types of exhibits, although very few or basically none of the heavy machinery, certain chemical raw materials, and precision instruments suitable for our needs were exhibited, the proportion of daily consumer goods exhibited is relatively large; however, it is not an easy task for our Japanese friends to hold such a large-scale exhibition. It is the result of the joint efforts of relevant trade groups and business people. As a member who once went to Japan to hold the Chinese Commodity Exhibition, I express my great admiration for the spirit of our Japanese friends in overcoming difficulties and striving forward.

Anyone who visits this exhibition can see that Japan's production technology level is very high, and there are many things worth learning from us. The broad masses of our people, especially those in the industrial sector, are very interested in the advanced Japanese technological level displayed in this exhibition. In the process of assisting the exhibition, our engineering and technical personnel have already learned a lot, and we will continue to learn humbly in the future.

The art design and layout of the exhibition are the result of much effort. Since the exhibits are exhibited separately by many manufacturers, the display of the exhibits must not only be centralized so that the audience can have a comprehensive overview, but also show the characteristics of each manufacturer, explain each sales company, and consider the conditions for commodity competition. After understanding these complex factors, we feel that the overall design of this venue and even the specific layout of each booth are carefully considered. Some viewers are not very accustomed to this exhibition method and feel that it is a bit like Beijing's Dong'an Market and not concentrated enough, but I think this "Dong'an Market-style" exhibition is a form that meets the needs of customers and commercial requirements, and it is also worth our reference.

Japanese international trade practitioners are masters in the international market. We can also get a glimpse of this from some of the exhibits in this exhibition. For example, the three-wheeled children's cars, small three-wheeled refrigerated trucks, etc. in the exhibits are specially designed and manufactured according to the needs of the Chinese market, which aroused great interest from the audience. The packaging and decoration of the goods also show that the Japanese business community attaches great importance to sales techniques. The appearance of each commodity can arouse the interest of consumers, and is therefore loved by visitors. This technique of closely integrating trade with production is worth learning carefully by all of us engaged in trade work.

We believe that the Japanese Commodity Exhibition will leave an extremely deep impression on people from Beijing, Shanghai, and even all over the country who come to visit, and will play its due role in helping us learn Japanese industrial technology after the war, increasing our understanding of Japanese commodity performance, promoting the further development of trade between the two countries, and thus enhancing the friendship between the people of the two countries.

China and Japan are separated by a strip of water and have favorable conditions for developing trade. As everyone knows, since 1952, non-governmental organizations in China and Japan have signed three trade agreements. The implementation of these agreements is gradually improving.

The first Sino-Japanese trade agreement signed in Beijing in June 1952 only achieved 5.05% of the total trade volume of 60 million pounds stipulated in the agreement; the second agreement signed in Beijing in October 1953 achieved 38.8% of the total agreement volume of 60 million pounds; the third agreement signed in Tokyo in May 1955 stipulated a trade volume of 60 million pounds, and the result of one year and four months of implementation achieved 75.12%, of which China's exports to Japan had achieved 91.21%, while Japan's exports to China only achieved 59.02%. This shows the trend of Sino-Japanese trade development.

Judging from the types of commodities traded in recent years, both imports and exports have been expanding year by year. For example, compared with the types of commodities traded in the second trade agreement and the first agreement, preliminary statistics show that China has increased the export of eighteen kinds of commodities such as miscellaneous beans and peanuts to Japan, and Japan has increased the export of twenty-six kinds of commodities such as ammonium sulfate and penicillin to China. The third agreement has increased the transaction of many new varieties compared with the second agreement: China's exports to Japan have increased by fifty kinds of commodities such as rapeseed, tea oil, barite, rubber, asbestos, cowhide, and horsehide; Japan's exports to China have increased by seventy-two kinds of commodities such as cement, camphor, insecticides, herbicides, three-wheeled trucks, centrifugal pumps, cotton and wool fabrics, dye intermediates, galvanized iron sheets, and tool steel. In 1956, many of China's imports from Japan were large-volume transactions. For example, China's purchase of phosphate fertilizer from Japan now ranks first among the countries to which Japan exports phosphate fertilizer, and the purchase volume has exceeded Japan's total export volume of phosphate fertilizer in 1954. The number of cement imported from Japan this year has accounted for a quarter of Japan's total exports. Some people in Japan said: "The transaction of more than 300,000 tons in one area in just two months is extremely rare for the Japanese cement industry." This helps to solve the difficulties of reduced domestic demand and excessive inventory in Japan. Since the United States stopped importing Japanese vitamin C and the Sterling area stopped importing Japanese sulfadiazine, Japan's above-mentioned medicines and streptomycin exports to China in 1956 ranked first in its exports. China has also purchased a large amount of rayon from Japan, ranking first among Japan's exporting countries in 1955, and the quantity this year is also considerable. The 70,000 sets of pesticide sprayers recently ordered by China from Japan is the largest contract for agricultural tools exported by Japan after the war.

In 1956, China purchased a large number of various machines from Japan, which is a new development direction in Sino-Japanese trade. As of now, China has ordered complete sets of machinery and equipment such as wool spinning, wool weaving, hemp spinning, silk reeling, silk weaving, printing and dyeing, long-pile weaving, and cotton spinning machine parts from Japan, with a total value of nearly 2 million pounds. This year, China's purchase of machinery from Japan has increased by about 12 times compared with last year, which is equal to one-third of Japan's total textile machine exports last year.

With the transaction of complete sets of equipment, technical exchanges between China and Japan have also entered the initial trial stage. For example, at the same time as the above-mentioned textile equipment is exported to China, more than a dozen Japanese technical experts will come to China to assist in the design and installation work. However, for the larger-scale technical exchanges between the two sides in the future, this is only a beginning. At present, since the relations between China and Japan have not yet been normalized, technical exchanges can only be included in the trade contracts signed by both parties individually according to the nature of the imported commodities. Judging from its development prospects and the requirements of both parties, this is far from enough. We hope to see the normalization of trade relations between the two countries soon, so that technical exchanges can develop more and more.

All parties in Japan have gradually realized the importance of Sino-Japanese trade to the Japanese national economy, which provides favorable conditions for solving the problems that should be solved in Sino-Japanese trade. Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry Tanzan Ishibashi published a commentary entitled "Promoting Japan-China Trade" in the "Japan Economic News" on June 25 this year, saying: "Historically, the economic relations between Japan and China must be close, and Japan must still adopt this policy in the future, which is unavoidable. …Most of the Japanese business people believe that the continuation of the traditional economic relations between Japan and China is a matter of life and death, and of course the Japanese government cannot ignore this practical demand." The Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry, one of Japan's large business groups, also issued a statement on September 18, demanding that the Japanese government relax the "embargo" on China, and specifically suggested solving the payment problem and simplifying procedures. This is enough to show that the conditions for further development of Sino-Japanese trade are gradually available, and some unresolved issues that hinder trade development should be said to have reached the moment when they should be resolved. Issues such as the signing of a trade agreement between the governments of China and Japan, the signing of a payment agreement between the national banks of the two countries, and the establishment of mutual commercial representative offices are all major issues related to the continued development of Sino-Japanese trade. However, the key to solving these problems still lies in the continued efforts of the Japanese business community and the sincerity of the Japanese government.

In daily contact with Japanese manufacturers, we often encounter some situations that hinder the development of trade, and these obstacles should be eliminated as soon as possible. First of all, due to the existence of artificial obstacles, the variety of commodities supplied by Japan to China is still too small, and the commodity supply is too narrow. As is well known, China is currently carrying out economic construction with heavy industry as the mainstay, and we need a lot of various heavy machinery, steel, precision lathes, heavy trucks, tractors, electrical equipment, precision machines and instruments, etc. However, due to the impact of the "embargo" policy, many products of the Japanese business community cannot meet China's needs. If Japan can export the above-mentioned materials and the conditions are considerable, we are naturally willing to purchase from Japan. This artificial restriction greatly hinders the normal development of trade between the two sides. When we can already order large ships from some European countries, Japanese wooden ships are still unable to export for a long time, which cannot but be very regrettable and strange. China is a planned economy. In order to complete the procurement task, we must put the plan on a solid and reliable basis and make comprehensive arrangements in advance. Therefore, the time factor is very important. We fully understand the current situation of the Japanese business community and are pleased with their efforts to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese trade. We hope that they can move forward on a realistic basis in the future, so that Sino-Japanese trade can expand to its due scale.

Secondly, the Japanese government's foreign exchange management and import and export management procedures are quite complicated, which often affects timely and large transactions. The so-called "Thomas" and "Anti-Thomas" barter methods (that is, the barter method of item-by-item balance) currently adopted by Japan to rigidly control the balance of imports and exports by using the balance of payments are not conducive to the greater development of trade between the two sides. There have long been many opinions in Japan about the inconvenience of this method. The Japanese "Toyo Keizai Shimpo" on August 25 this year said: "Since the cement transaction in April this year, the amount of Japan-China trade has risen rapidly, but the use of barter methods has always been inconvenient, which affects the transaction volume. If the rice anti-Thomas needs to be filled, but cement exporters are unwilling to transfer the Thomas quota, which is inconvenient for each other." In addition, there is often this situation: After China signs a contract for exports to Japan, it takes a long time for the Japanese side to issue a letter of credit. According to Japanese manufacturers, Japanese import and export procedures and foreign exchange procedures are very cumbersome, and it takes 40 to 50 days to obtain a license. This is a rare situation in other countries, and we also hope to get rapid improvement.

Thirdly, China's exports of bulk commodities to Japan are increasing year by year. As of now, China's exports of rice to Japan have been nearly doubled compared with the second agreement period; the transaction of 1 million tons of salt this year has increased by about 50% compared with the second agreement period; the export of coal has been more than 260,000 tons, an increase of 25.88% compared with the export during the second agreement period. The commodities sold by China to Japan have always been cheap and good. In addition to the above-mentioned bulk commodities, we can also supply many varieties, such as food, animal products, and local and special products. As far as we know, these are also needed by the broad masses of the Japanese people. However, difficulties are often encountered in specific transactions. For example, we have negotiated with Japanese manufacturers for taro, jellyfish, preserved eggs, refined antimony, etc. in the past, but the contracts were canceled because the Japanese government did not allow imports. This situation should also be improved in the future.

China's first five-year plan is about to be successfully completed, and the second five-year plan is about to begin. The prospects for the development of Sino-Japanese trade in the future will be even broader. We sincerely hope that the Japanese business community can continue to work hard to overcome difficulties, so that Sino-Japanese trade can achieve healthy development and become increasingly prosperous.

Since the opening of the exhibition, it has aroused widespread attention from Beijing citizens and business people in just a few days. I am convinced that this exhibition will greatly promote the further development of Sino-Japanese trade in the future. I would like to congratulate the success of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition.

    从日本商品展览会看中日贸易的发展前途
    中国进出口公司经理　曹中枢
    日本商品展览会在北京揭幕了。参观者十分踊跃。这次展览会的展品众多，规模宏大。它是中日贸易史上的一件盛举，而且是日本在国外单独举办展览规模最大的一次。从展品品种上看，虽然适合我国需要的一些重型机械、某些化工原料和精密仪表等展出的很少或者基本上未获展出，而日用消费品展出的比重较大；但是能够举办如此规模的展览会，对日本的朋友们说来，已不是一件容易的事情。它是有关的贸易团体以及工商界人士共同努力的结果。作为曾经赴日举办中国商品展览会的一个成员，我对于日本朋友们这种排除困难、努力前进的精神，表示莫大的钦佩。
    凡是参观这一展览会的人都可以看到：日本的生产技术水平是很高的，有许多地方值得我们学习。我国广大人民，尤其是工业界人士，对这次展览所显示出来的日本先进技术水平都感到很大兴趣。在协助展出的过程中，我国的工程技术人员已学习了不少东西，今后我们还将继续虚心学习。
    展览会的美术设计和布置工作，是花了许多心血的。由于展品是由许多厂商分别展出的，在展品的陈列上既要求集中，使观众能综览全貌，又要求能表现各制造厂商的特色，说明各经销的商号，并须考虑到商品竞争的条件。了解了这一些复杂的因素之后，我们就感到，这次会场的总设计乃至各摊的具体布置，都是煞费思索的。某些观众对这种展出方式还不大习惯，觉得有点像北京的东安市场，不够集中，但我认为这种“东安市场式”的展出，是一种适合顾客需要和商业上的要求的形式，也是值得我们参考的。
    日本的国际贸易从业人员是国际市场上的能手。我们从这次展出的某些展品上也可以窥其一二。如展品中的三轮儿童汽车、小型三轮冷藏车等，都是根据中国市场的需要而专门设计制造的，因而引起了观众的极大兴趣。商品的包装与装璜，也表现了日本工商界对销售技术的十分重视。每一件商品的外形，都能引起消费者的兴趣，因而为参观者所喜爱。这种将贸易与生产紧密结合起来的技巧，值得我们所有从事贸易工作的人认真学习。
    我们相信，日本商品展览会必将为北京和上海乃至全国各地前来参观的人们留下极为深刻的印象，对于我们学习战后日本的工业技术，增加对日本商品性能的了解，促进两国贸易的进一步发展，从而增进两国人民之间的友谊，都将起到它应有的作用。
    中日两国一水之隔，具备着发展贸易的有利条件。大家知道，从1952年至今，中日两国的民间团体订过三次贸易协议。这些协议的执行情况是在逐渐改进的。
    1952年6月在北京签订的第一次中日贸易协议，执行结果仅实现了协议规定的贸易总额六千万英镑的5.05％；1953年10月在北京签订的第二次协议，实现了协议总额六千万英镑的38.8％；1955年5月在东京签订的第三次协议规定的六千万英镑贸易额，执行一年零四个月的结果，实现了75.12％，其中中国对日本出口已实现了91.21％，日本对中国出口则只实现了59.02％。这就可以看出中日贸易发展的趋向。
    从近年来成交的商品品种看来，在进口、出口方面都是逐年扩大的。如以第二次贸易协议与第一次协议的成交品种相较，初步统计，我国对日本增加了杂豆、花生等十八种商品出口，日本对我国增加了硫酸錏、青霉素等二十六种商品出口。第三次协议较第二次协议更增加了许多新品种的成交：我国对日本的出口增加了菜籽、茶油、重晶石、胶料、石棉、牛皮、马皮等五十种商品；日本对我国的出口增加了水泥、樟脑、杀虫剂、除草剂、三轮卡车、离心泵、棉毛织品、染料中间体、镀锌铁皮、工具钢等七十二种商品。1956年中国从日本进口的贸易中，有许多是大宗交易。如中国向日本购买磷肥，现在已占日本出口磷肥的国别对象第一位，购买量已超过1954年日本磷肥的全部出口量。本年从日本进口水泥的数字，已占日本出口总数的四分之一。日本有人说：“短短两个月中在一个地区就成交了三十万吨以上，这对日本水泥业说来，是极少有的事情。”这有助于解决日本国内需要减少、存货过多的困难。自从美国停止进口日本的丙种维生素，英镑地区停止日本的磺胺嘧啶的进口以后，1956年日本的上述药品及链霉素等对中国出口就占其出口的首位了。中国并曾向日本大量采购人造丝，1955年占日本出口国别第一位，今年的数量也不在少数。最近我国向日本订购的农药喷雾器七万架，是日本战后出口农业工具的最大的一个合同。
    1956年中国向日本大量采购各种机械，这是中日贸易的一个新的发展方向。截至目前为止，我国已经从日本订购了毛纺、毛织、麻纺、缫丝、丝织、印染、长毛绒织等成套机器设备和棉纺机零件等，总价将近二百万英镑。本年我国向日本采购机器的金额，已较去年增加约十二倍，这一数字等于去年日本纺织机出口总额的三分之一。
    随着成套设备的交易，中日两国的技术交流也进入初步试行阶段。例如在上述各种纺织设备向中国出口的同时，日本将有十余位技术专家来我国协助设计安装工作。但对今后的更大规模的双方技术交流工作而言，这还仅仅是一个开始。目前由于中日两国关系还未正常化，只能个别地按照进口商品的性质将技术交流工作订入双方签订的贸易合同中。就其发展前途及双方要求看来，这是很不足的。我们希望很快看到两国贸易关系的正常化，使技术交流工作愈益发展起来。
    日本朝野各方已逐渐认识到中日贸易对日本国民经济的重要性，这就为解决中日贸易中应行解决的问题提供了有利条件。日本通商产业相石桥湛山今年6月25日在“日本经济新闻”上发表了一篇以“促进日中贸易”为题的评论，他说：“从历史看来，日本和中国的经济关系必须密切起来，今后日本仍然要采取这种方针，这是不可避免的。……日本多数的工商业人士都认为日本同中国继续传统的经济关系是个死活问题，当然日本政府也不能忽视这种切实要求”。日本工商界大团体之一的东京商工会议所，也在9月18日发表声明，要求日本政府放宽对中国的“禁运”，并具体建议解决支付问题和简化手续等问题。这足以说明目前进一步开展中日贸易的条件逐渐具备了，有些妨碍贸易发展的未决问题应该说是到了该解决的时刻了。如签订中日两国政府间的贸易协议、签订两国国家银行间的支付协议、互设商务代表机构等问题，都是关系中日贸易继续发展的主要问题。但这些问题的解决，关键仍在于日本工商界的继续努力和日本政府方面的诚意。
    在日常和日本厂商接触过程中，我们经常遇到一些妨碍贸易开展的情况，这些障碍是应当早日排除的。首先是由于存在着人为障碍，日本方面对中国供应的商品品种还是太少，商品供应面太窄。如所周知，我国目前正在进行以重工业为主的经济建设，我们所需要的各种重型机械、钢材、精密车床、重型卡车、拖拉机、电气设备、精密机器和仪器等，都是很多的。但是由于“禁运”政策影响，日本工商界的许多产品都不能供应中国的需要。如果日本能出口上述物资，而且条件相当，我们自然也愿意从日本购买的。这种人为的限制大大妨碍了双方贸易的正常发展。在我们已经可以向欧洲某些国家订购大型轮船时，日本的木造船却还迟迟不能出口，这不能不是令人十分遗憾而且感到奇怪的事。中国是计划经济，为了完成采购任务，我们必须把计划放在稳妥可靠的基础之上，并须提早做出全面安排，因此，时间因素就非常重要。我们充分理解日本工商界目前的处境，对于他们在促进中日贸易正常化方面所做的努力感到欣慰，希望他们今后能在现实基础上向前发展，使中日贸易能扩大到应有的规模。
    其次，日本政府在外汇管理和进出口管理手续上相当繁复，也经常影响及时的、大宗的成交。日本目前所采取的利用支付平衡硬性控制进出口平衡的一套所谓“托马斯”、“反托马斯”易货办法（即逐笔平衡的易货办法），是不利于双方贸易的更大发展的。关于这种办法的不便，在日本国内已早有许多意见。今年8月25
  日的日本“东洋经济新报”就说：“本年4月起水泥成交后，日中贸易额急速上涨，但一贯采用易货办法，大家愈感不便，影响成交额。如大米反托马斯需要填补，但水泥出口商不愿将托马斯额度转让，互感不便。”另外，还常有这种情况：中国对
  日本出口签订合同后，历时很久日方还不能开来信用证。据日本厂商反映：日本进出口手续及办理外汇手续非常繁琐，需时四、五十天才能领到许可证。这在其他国家是罕见的情况，我们也希望能得到迅速的改善。
    再次，中国对日本出口的大宗商品是逐年增加的。第三次协议执行到目前为止，中国对日本出口大米已将近第二次协议时期的一倍；本年成交盐一百万吨，较第二次协议期间增加约50％；煤的出口已有二十六万余吨，较第二次协议期间的出口增加25.88％。中国售给日本的商品一向也是价廉物美的。除去上述大宗商品而外，我们还能供应许多品种，如食品、畜产品及土、特产品等，据我们所知，这些也是日本广大人民所需要的。但在具体交易中，也常常遇到困难。例如我们过去向日本厂商洽售过的芋角、海蜇、皮蛋、精锑等，就因为日本政府不准进口而取消了合同。今后这种情况也应当改善。
    我国的第一个五年计划即将胜利完成，第二个五年计划就要开始了。今后中日贸易发展前途将更为广阔，我们衷心希望日本工商界能继续努力排除困难，使中日贸易能得到健康的发展而日益欣欣向荣。
    展览会开幕以来短短几天，已引起了北京市民和工商界人士的广泛重视。我深信，这次展出，对于今后中日贸易的进一步发展，将起很大推动作用。我在此祝贺日本商品展览会的成功。
