    Xinhua News Agency, dispatch from Brussels, 5th: The secretariat of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers has issued a statement saying that the association has submitted a declaration on the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The association points out the legality of the Egyptian government's nationalization of the canal and emphasizes that, based on the principles of national independence and sovereignty, every country has the right to independently handle ownership and economic system issues within its own territory, handling them in whatever way it deems most beneficial to ensuring its own needs. Furthermore, the nationalization of the canal is Egypt's internal affair, and is undoubtedly legal from the perspective of international law. The Suez Canal Company is an Egyptian company, managed according to Egyptian law.
    Some say that this nationalization is illegal because it abolishes the lease granted to the company. This argument has no basis from the perspective of international law, just as there is no basis to the argument that nationalization will infringe upon the freedom of passage on the canal.
    The Democratic Lawyers Association believes that the use of force and economic sanctions, or the threat to use force and economic sanctions, to resolve disputes arising between certain countries and Egypt due to the nationalization of the canal is illegal. The statement emphasizes that a lawful resolution to the disputes can only be achieved in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.

    国际民主法律工作者协会向联合国声明
    埃及收回运河合理合法
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社布鲁塞尔4日讯：国际民主法律工作者协会秘书处发表公告说，这个协会已经把一篇关于苏伊士运河公司国有化问题的声明交给联合国秘书长。协会指出埃及政府把运河收归国有的合法性，并且强调说，从国家独立和主权的原则出发，每个国家都有权在本国领土上自行处理所有权的问题和经济制度问题，它认为怎样对保证自己的需要最有利就怎样处理。此外，运河的国有化是埃及国家的内政，从国际法的角度看来是无可怀疑的。苏伊士运河公司是埃及的公司，是按照埃及的法律来管理的。
    有人说这种国有化是不合法的，因为这就废除了给予公司的租借权，这种说法从国际法的角度看来是没有理由的，它同国有化似乎会侵害运河上的通行自由的说法是同样的没有理由。
    民主法律工作者协会认为，使用武力和经济制裁或者是威胁要使用武力和经济制裁来解决由于运河国有化而在某些国家和埃及之间发生的争执，是不合法的。声明强调指出，只有按照联合国宪章的规定，才能求得争执问题的合法解决。
