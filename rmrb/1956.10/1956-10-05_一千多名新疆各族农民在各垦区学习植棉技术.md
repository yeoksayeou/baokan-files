Xinhua News Agency dispatch: More than 1,000 farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, who had been learning cotton planting techniques and other advanced experiences in various reclamation areas of the Xinjiang Military Region Agricultural Production Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, have returned to their respective regions one after another.

These farmers were all cadres and activists from agricultural cooperatives in various parts of the Autonomous Region. In March of this year, they came to the Manas and Aksu reclamation areas. After nearly half a year of production practice, they learned selection and seed mixing, seed vernalization, and row planting with close spacing. They also learned advanced techniques such as multiple cultivations and loosening of soil in cotton fields, layered fertilization, ditch irrigation, and artificial pollination of corn. Many farmers learned how to use and repair new agricultural implements during their internship, and they also earnestly studied the business management methods of the agricultural production corps.
