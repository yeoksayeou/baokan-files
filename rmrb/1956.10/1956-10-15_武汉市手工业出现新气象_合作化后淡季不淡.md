Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 10th: Wuhan's handicraft industry, after cooperativization, has changed the pattern of slack business in the third quarter of each year. Over one thousand handicraft production cooperatives in the city have overfulfilled their production value plans for the third quarter of this year, with the total production value approaching that of the peak season – the second quarter.

In the past, it was difficult for Wuhan's handicraftsmen to maintain production in the third quarter, and the handicraft output value was the lowest in this quarter every year. Some handicraft households with large families often faced difficulties in their lives during this period. Since entering the third quarter of this year, in addition to a few industries in Wuhan whose production development has been restricted due to a shortage of raw materials, most of the cooperative organizations in the industry have strived to utilize waste and old materials, overfulfilling their production value plans month by month. Tailors used to work half a day and rest half a day in the third quarter because there was little work to do, but in the third quarter of this year, business was booming in the stores of various tailoring production cooperatives because people were buying autumn and winter clothes in advance. The cotton-padding and chemical industries entered the peak production season in July ahead of schedule. Although the members of the production cooperatives have been working overtime day and night in recent months, cotton wadding, rolled cotton, and cold cream are still in short supply. Han-patterned leather shoes, which were once popular in the Northeast and Northwest regions before 1953, were once unpopular due to poor quality and outdated styles. The organized shoemaking handicraftsmen have made many improvements in tanning and shoemaking, gradually restoring their original reputation, and the production of leather shoes in the third quarter has increased threefold compared with the first quarter.

    武汉市手工业出现新气象
    合作化后淡季不淡
    新华社武汉10日电　武汉市手工业合作化后，改变每年第三季度营业清淡的规律，全市一千多个手工业生产合作社超额完成了今年第三季度的产值计划，总产值接近旺季——第二季度的总产值。
    武汉市手工业者以往不容易维持第三季度的生产，每年手工业产值以这一个季度为最低。有些家庭人口多的手工业户，在这期间生活往往发生困难。今年进入第三季度以来，武汉市手工业除了少数行业因为原材料较缺，发展生产受到限制以外，绝大部分行业的合作组织努力利用废料和旧料，月月超额完成产值计划。缝纫业的手工业者，过去每到第三季度因为活少大都做半天歇半天，而今年第三季度由于人们提前添置秋冬服装，各缝纫生产社的门市部个个生意兴旺。絮花业、化工业在7月份提前进入生产旺季，生产合作社社员们近月来虽然日夜加班生产，但是棉絮、卷花、蛤蜊油等仍然供不应求。在1953年以前曾经畅销东北、西北等地的汉纹皮鞋，一度因为质量差式样老，不受顾客欢迎；组织起来的制鞋手工业者在制革、尚鞋等方面作了许多改进，逐渐恢复了原有声誉，第三季度生产的皮鞋比第一季度增加了三倍。
