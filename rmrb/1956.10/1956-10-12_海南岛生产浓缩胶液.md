Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 9th. Concentrated latex, a major raw material in the rubber industry, has begun to be produced in large quantities on Hainan Island and is being shipped to factories in Guangzhou, Shanghai, and other places for trial use. In the past, Hainan Island could only produce raw rubber sheets, and all the concentrated latex needed in our country had to be imported from abroad. Concentrated latex is generally used to manufacture more advanced rubber products, such as the gloves used by doctors during surgery and balloons used for meteorological measurements.

    海南岛生产浓缩胶液
    新华社广州9日电　橡胶工业中的一项主要原料——浓缩胶液，已经开始在海南岛大量生产，并且运到广州、上海等地的工厂试用。过去海南岛只能出产生胶片，我国所需的浓缩胶液全部要从国外输入。浓缩胶液一般是用来制造比较高级的橡胶品，如医生施手术时所用的手套、测量气象用的气球等。
