Xinhua News Agency report:

    Sichuan Medical College held its second scientific symposium on the 5th and 6th of October in Chengdu. This symposium discussed ninety scientific papers, of which nineteen were reports related to traditional Chinese medicine. The article "Comprehensive Preliminary Research on Coptis chinensis" jointly reported by six teaching and research groups, including internal medicine, pharmacology, and microbiology, conducted a more detailed discussion on the pharmacology, antibacterial effects, mechanism of action, and clinical application of berberine, the main component of Coptis chinensis.

    Many papers used cases treated with traditional Chinese medicine to demonstrate the principles and effects of traditional Chinese medicine.

    Many famous traditional Chinese medicine doctors also participated in the symposium. After Western medicine doctor Zhang Shuhui gave a "Preliminary Report on the Treatment of Lung Abscess with Traditional Chinese Medicine," Li Sichi, a well-known traditional Chinese medicine doctor in Chengdu in his sixties, made a supplementary speech to the report. Some Western medicine doctors raised questions about the diuretic effect of traditional Chinese medicine in treating nephritis and edema, which were also answered by traditional Chinese medicine doctors and Western medicine doctors at the meeting.

    Famous Western medicine doctors from hospitals in Chengdu and Chongqing also participated in the symposium. They enriched the discussion with theoretical and clinical materials. Fan Peilu, director of the pediatrics department of Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, used his own rich materials from his work in the discussion of treating nephritis and edema, explaining that there are many areas where traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine can communicate, and that it is necessary to strengthen the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine in treatment.

    四川医学院举行学术讨论会
    讨论了十九篇有关中医中药的学术论文
    据新华社讯　四川医学院第二次科学讨论会5日、6日在成都举行。这次讨论会讨论了九十篇科学论文，其中有十九篇是有关中医中药的报告。由内科、药理、微生物等六个教研组联合报告的“黄连综合性初步研究”一文，对黄连中主要成分小蘖硷的药理、抗生作用、机转作用以及临床应用等问题作了较详细的探讨。
    许多论文用中医中药治疗的病例来论证中医中药的原理和效果。
    许多著名的中医师也参加了讨论会。西医张澍慧作了“中医中药治疗肺脓肿的初步报告”后，六十多岁的成都著名中医李斯炽对这一报告作了补充发言。有的西医对中医中药治疗肾炎水肿的利尿作用提出疑问，也经会上的中医和西医作了解答。
    参加讨论会的还有成都、重庆各个医院的著名西医师。他们用理论和临床材料丰富了讨论内容。四川省人民医院小儿科主任樊培禄在讨论治疗肾炎水肿中，就运用了他自己工作中的丰富材料，说明了中西医在许多方面有可以沟通的地方，和加强中西医配合治疗的必要。
