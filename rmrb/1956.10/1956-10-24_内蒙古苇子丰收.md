    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved a bumper harvest of reeds this year. The state-owned Yingkou and Jinzhou Paper Mills have signed supply contracts with the Autonomous Region's Supply and Marketing Cooperative for more than 37,000 tons of reeds.
    Reeds are an important raw material for papermaking. They are a wild plant that farmers used to burn as firewood, or cut down before they were fully grown to feed livestock. Since Inner Mongolia basically achieved agricultural cooperativization last winter, reeds have become an important sideline production for agricultural cooperatives, which now manage, protect, and harvest them in a planned way.
    The eastern region of Inner Mongolia has abundant reed resources. According to preliminary surveys, the reed marshes in the Zhelimumeng area alone cover more than 300,000 mu. The reeds here are of excellent quality and meet the requirements for papermaking.

    内蒙古苇子丰收
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区今年的苇子获得丰收。国营营口、锦州两造纸厂已和自治区供销合作社签订了三万七千多吨苇子的供应合同。
    苇子是造纸的重要原料，它是一种野生植物，过去农民常把它当柴禾烧了，或者不到长成就割了喂牲口，自从去年冬天内蒙古基本上实现农业合作化后，苇子已成为农业合作社有计划经营、保护和收割的重要副业生产之一了。
    内蒙古东部地区有着丰富的苇源。据初步调查，仅哲里木盟一个地区的苇塘面积就达三十多万亩。这里的苇子，质量优良，合乎造纸要求。
