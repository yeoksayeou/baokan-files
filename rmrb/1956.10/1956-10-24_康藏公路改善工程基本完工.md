Xinhua News Agency, Qamdo, October 20th. The improvement project on the Kangzang Highway was basically completed in early October, three months ahead of the original plan. Now, many wooden signs along the highway warning of "Dangerous Driving" have been removed, and these areas can now be open to traffic year-round. The glacier areas, which are geologically very unstable, can also remain open for three-quarters of the year.

Along the highway in high and cold areas such as Que'er Mountain and Seqi La Mountain, four ice protection walls with a total length of more than 500 meters have been built. These ice protection walls are all made of large stones to block ice water from flowing and prevent the road surface from freezing, ensuring safe driving in winter. A 240-meter-long snow shelter has also been built on Que'er Mountain. In the Bomi area, where the geology is loose and collapses frequently, retaining walls have been built along the highway, and in two places, two mud protection corridors, each 250 meters long, have been built with large wooden materials. After treatment, the roadbed in the quicksand area of Bomi has stabilized. There have been no incidents of vehicles being blocked in the quicksand area this year. Many dangerous roads along the mountain have also been widened.

While carrying out the improvement project, a housing construction team built 34 houses along the highway, including dormitories for road maintenance workers and offices for road maintenance agencies. Restaurants have been set up along the highway.

The Kangzang Highway improvement project started in the spring of 1955. Most of the nearly 10,000 workers who participated in the construction had previously participated in the construction of the Kangzang Highway. They spent seven years on the snowy mountains, grasslands, primeval forests, and riverbanks of the Kangzang Plateau. Many workers have become leading cadres and advanced producers.

    康藏公路改善工程基本完工
    新华社昌都20日电　康藏公路改善工程已在十月上旬基本完工，比原订计划提前了三个月。现在，公路旁许多标志“行车危险”的木牌已经去掉，这些地方以后都可以常年通车了。地质极不稳定的冰川地带，也可以保持每年有四分之三的时间畅通无阻。
    在雀儿山、色齐拉山等高寒地带的公路旁，已修筑了总长五百多公尺的四道防冰墙，这些防冰墙都是用大石砌成，挡住冰水不泻，防止路面结冰，保证冬季行车安全。在雀儿山上还修筑了一条二百四十公尺长的防雪走廊。在波密地区地质疏松、经常坍方的地段，公路旁都修筑了挡土墙，有两处还用粗大的木料搭成了两座长二百五十公尺的防泥走廊。波密地区的流沙地带，经整治后公路路基稳定下来了。今年在流沙地带还没有发生过阻车现象。沿线许多傍山险道，也都作了加宽。
    在进行改善工程的同时，一支房屋建筑工程队在公路沿线修建了三十四幢房屋，其中有养路工人宿舍和养路机关办公室等。公路沿途都设有饭站。
    康藏公路改善工程从1955年春天开始，参加施工的近万名工人大部分是曾经参加修筑康藏公路的，他们在康藏高原的雪山草地上、原始森林里和江流旁，度过了七个年头，许多工人已经成为领导干部和先进生产者。
