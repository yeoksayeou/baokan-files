Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 30th - A civil aviation passenger plane successfully completed trial flights on the Chongqing-Guiyang air route on the 28th and 29th. This route, which has been suspended for several years, will be reopened in a few days.

    The Chongqing-Guiyang air route was previously restored in 1950; however, it was suspended due to the lack of passengers and cargo. The reopening of this route is more than a year ahead of the civil aviation department's original plan.

    重庆—贵阳航线试航成功
    新华社重庆30日电　一架民航客机28、29两日成功地完成了重庆—贵阳航线的试航飞行。这条中断好几年的航线再过几天就可以复航了。
    重庆—贵阳航线在1950年曾经恢复航行；后来，因为客人和货物都很少，便停航了。这条航线复航比民用航空部门原来的规划提前了一年多。
