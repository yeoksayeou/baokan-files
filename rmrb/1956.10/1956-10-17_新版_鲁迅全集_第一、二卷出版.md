Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The first two volumes of the new edition of "Complete Works of Lu Xun" have been published by People's Literature Publishing House and will be released in Beijing on the 17th and 18th.

The new edition of "Complete Works of Lu Xun" is being published to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of Lu Xun's death. It consists of ten volumes with approximately three million words, divided into ten books, and is expected to be completed next year. The biggest difference between this edition and the complete works published in 1938 by the Lu Xun Memorial Committee and the Lu Xun Complete Works Publishing House is that this new version exclusively includes Lu Xun's creations, commentaries, and literary history works, and adds all the letters that have now been collected. Lu Xun's translated foreign works and edited and proofread ancient Chinese works will be published separately.

Another feature of the new edition of "Complete Works of Lu Xun" is that the editors have added some brief annotations at the end of each volume. The main content of the annotations is to explain the historical and social background of Lu Xun's writing, as well as the relevant people and events, based on more extensive original materials. Brief explanations have also been added to the Chinese and foreign allusions quoted in Lu Xun's works. The first volume of the complete works (including "A Call to Arms," "Grave," and "Hot Wind") has one hundred and three pages of annotation text. All the works in the new edition have also been collated based on the versions personally proofread by Lu Xun, the newspapers and periodicals in which the articles were originally published, and some of Lu Xun's manuscripts, correcting errors in words or punctuation in previous editions.

The publication of "Complete Works of Lu Xun" began shortly after the founding of the People's Republic of China, and a specialized institution was established at the end of 1950 to collect, organize, and edit all of Lu Xun's works. This work has received assistance from a wide range of people in society.

In addition, Lu Xun's diaries from 1912 to 1936, spanning twenty-five years, have also begun to be organized and prepared for typesetting and publication, for scholars to study and reference.

    新版“鲁迅全集”第一、二卷出版
    新华社16日讯　新版“鲁迅全集”第一、二两卷已由人民文学出版社出版，17、18两日将在北京发行。
    新版“鲁迅全集”是为纪念鲁迅逝世二十周年而出版的，共计十卷约三百万字，分为十册，约在明年出齐。它同1938年由鲁迅先生纪念委员会编辑和鲁迅全集出版社出版的全集最大的不同，是这个新版本专收鲁迅的创作、评论和文学史著作，并增加了现在搜集到的全部书信。鲁迅翻译的外国作品和编校的中国古代作品将另行出版。
    新版“鲁迅全集”的另一特色，是由编者加了一些简略的注释，附在每卷的后面。注释的主要内容，是根据较为广泛的原始材料，来说明鲁迅写作时的历史社会背景、以及有关的人物和事件。鲁迅著作中所引的中外古今典故也加了简要的说明。全集第一卷（包括“呐喊”、“坟”、“热风”）就附有一百零三页的注释文字。新版全集的全部作品，还根据鲁迅亲手校订的版本、最初发表文章的报刊和鲁迅一些手稿，作了校勘，改正了过去各种版本中印错的字或标点。
    关于“鲁迅全集”的出版工作，在中华人民共和国成立后不久即着手进行，1950年底还成立了专门的机构负责收集、整理、编辑鲁迅的全部著作。这项工作得到广大社会人士的帮助。
    另外，鲁迅从1912年至1936年二十五年间的日记，也已经着手整理，准备用铅字排印出版，供学者们研究参考。
