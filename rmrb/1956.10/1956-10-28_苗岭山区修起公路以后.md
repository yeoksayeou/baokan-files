Around the main peak of the Miao Mountain Range, Mount Leigong, live more than 400,000 Miao people. This is the main settlement area of the Miao ethnic group in Guizhou Province. Here, towering peaks isolate the Miao families. For generations, the Miao people have longed for a major road to be built in the Miao Mountain area to bring happiness to their homes. Now, this wish has been realized. A 197-kilometer-long Leitaijian Highway has been built in the Miao Mountains, and the entire highway is open to traffic.

The market towns along the highway are rapidly changing their original appearance. The edge of Leishan County was originally a wilderness. Since the establishment of a bus station, many commercial departments have built houses and warehouses there, and the prototype of a new street has already appeared. Kaili, the location of the People's Committee of the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, which is under construction, was just a small town of 4,000 people in the spring of this year, but now there are more than 2,000 construction workers concentrating there to build a new city. On the land that was rice fields not long ago, the buildings of the State People's Committee and the library have already been erected. The bus station is piled with building materials, fuel, and food transported from all over the country, as well as batches of tobacco leaves, Chinese gall, and other local products to be transported out. Thanks to the completion and opening of the Longtouhe large stone bridge across the Qingshui River, the connection between Kaili and other places is no longer threatened by the floods of the Qingshui River.

Wherever the bus goes, the commercial departments there revise the commodity prices. The purchase price of local products has increased, and the selling price of industrial products has decreased. Some departments have adjusted prices more than once. After liberation, the Miao families in the deep mountains ended the painful days of using ash water as salt. This time, with the opening of the highway, the price of salt has dropped a lot, and cloth is also cheaper than before.

The Miao Mountain area is a resource-rich place. In recent years, the Miao people have used a large amount of timber, grain, and various local products to support the construction of the motherland. On Mount Leigong, there are also vast forests. However, due to inconvenient transportation, many thick fir trees rotted in the mountains in the past. In mid-July, when the highway was built to Taijiang, the Taijiang Branch of the Forest Industry Bureau was established accordingly. In three months, it purchased 1,400 cubic meters of square timber, increasing the income of local Miao farmers by about 30,000 yuan. Underground, people can find coal in many places, and mercury, lead, and phosphorus are not rare minerals either. Many oil seedlings have been discovered in the Miao Mountains, but no one knows their details. After the highway was opened, the trucks transported oil drilling rigs into the deep mountains.

### 苗岭山区修起公路以后

    苗岭山区修起公路以后
    新华社记者　刘扬深
    在苗岭山脉主峰——雷公山周围，聚居着四十多万苗族人民。这是贵州省苗族的主要聚居区。这一带，林立的山峰把苗家隔离着。苗族人民世代盼望着在苗岭山区修一条大道，给苗家带来幸福。现在，这个愿望实现了，苗岭山上修起了一百九十七公里长的雷台剑公路，公路全线通车了。
    公路沿线的集镇正在迅速改变着原来的面貌。雷山县城边原是一片荒野，自从设立汽车站后，许多商业部门在那里盖房子修仓库，新的街道雏型已经出现。正在建设中的黔东南苗族侗族自治州人民委员会所在地——凯里，今年春天的时候，还只是一个四千人的小集镇，可是现在有二千多名建筑工人，正集中在那里建设一座新的城市。在不久前还是禾田的土地上，已经矗立起州人民委员会、图书馆的大楼。汽车站上堆满了各地运来的建筑器材、燃料、食品，还有成批将要运出的烟叶、五棓子等土特产品。由于横跨清水江的龙头河大石桥竣工通车，凯里和外地的联系再也不受清水江洪水的威胁了。
    汽车通到哪里，哪里的商业部门就改订商品牌价。土特产品的收购价格提高了，工业产品的出售价格降低了。有的部门物价还不止调整一次。解放后，深山苗家结束了用灰水当盐巴的惨痛日子，这次公路通车，盐价又下降了不少，布匹也比过去更加便宜了。
    苗岭山区是一个资源丰富的地方。几年来，苗族人民用大量的木材、粮食和各种土特产品支援祖国的建设。在雷公山上，还有着广阔的森林。但是由于运输不便，过去许多粗大的杉树腐烂在山中。7月中旬，公路修到了台江，森林工业局台江支局随着建立起来，三个月中就收购了方板一千四百多立方公尺，给当地苗族农民增加了三万元左右的收入。在地下，人们能在许多地方挖到煤炭，汞、铅、磷也不是稀罕的矿产。苗岭山区已经发现许多石油苗，可是谁也不知道它的底细。公路修通后，汽车就把石油钻机运到了深山里面。
