    Introduction to the Dahuofang Reservoir

    October 27th was an unusual day at the Dahuofang Reservoir construction site – the reservoir's dam was closed on this day. The jubilant crowds, thronged in front of the three-mile-long dam, watching the Hun River flow, now compressed to a width of twenty meters, flowing downstream through the diversion tunnel. This river, which constantly floods and causes disasters, will, according to the people's arrangements, benefit the people on both banks.

    The Hun River has brought countless disasters to the people on both banks. In the exhibition hall here, there are materials on the 1937 flood disaster, which flooded more than 30 million mu of fields and affected more than 300,000 people. The construction of the Dahuofang Reservoir is to block the Hun River's once-in-a-century flood. The construction of this reservoir is not only to block floods and stop the Hun River's disasters, but also to use the reservoir's water to irrigate more than 900,000 mu of farmland downstream. The reservoir's water can supply industrial water to Shenyang and Fushun. The reservoir's water can also be used for power generation and fish farming, supplying the people of Shenyang, Fushun, Benxi, and Anshan. This reservoir is the largest reservoir under construction in our country.

    Now, the prototype of this reservoir has already taken shape. From a distance, the 300-meter-wide dam stretches from the mountain on this bank to the mountain on the opposite bank, and from the mountain on the opposite bank, it connects to another mountain through a gully. The highest point has been built to eighteen or nineteen meters high. The semi-circular concrete diversion tunnel running through the bottom of the mountain on the south bank is more than a mile long, and the gate opening and closing tower at the entrance has already surpassed the top of the mountain by several feet. The spillway built on the north bank of the Hun River has cut through the mountainside and extended to the bottom of the mountain, allowing the largest floods to overflow downstream.

    The Dahuofang Reservoir construction site differs from the Huai River, Guanting Reservoir, Boshan Reservoir, and Nanwan Reservoir water conservancy construction sites in that the degree of mechanization of construction here is higher. Machines are everywhere on the construction site, and these machines are running day and night. Long lines of small trains, filled with sand and clay by dredgers and excavators, race to the dam. Belt conveyors, along the sloping dam face, transport the sand and clay to the dam. Then, bulldozers spread the sand and soil, and tractors and sheep's-foot rollers roll back and forth. Here, the mechanized joint operation has already begun in our country's water conservancy construction projects. The director of the Dahuofang Reservoir Engineering Bureau said: "There are only more than 40,000 people working on this large construction site now. If there were no machines, there would have to be at least 100,000 people. Without these machines, the dam could not have been closed so quickly today."

    The closure of the dam marks the birth of the reservoir. However, the construction of this reservoir was not smooth sailing. After the reservoir started construction in 1953, it encountered many difficulties and problems. The clay used to build the waterproof core wall had too high a water content and could not be compacted even after rolling it more than sixty times. The clay was like rubber, pressing here and bulging there. The sand used to build the dam body, the fine sand, could not meet the design standards no matter how much it was compacted, and the coarse sand met the design standards without any compaction. But how could the dam be built with just sand! People from the Ministry of Water Resources and Soviet experts came here in 1954 and were very surprised. Tracing the reasons, they found that the initial surveying and soil testing were very rough, incomplete, and inaccurate, and there were many design errors. There are two industrial cities, Fushun and Shenyang, downstream of the Hun River, but the design set the quality of the dam's clay core wall very low, making it difficult to guarantee the safety of these two cities. The same quality standards were specified for the sand, regardless of whether it was coarse or fine, and many problems could not be solved. As a result, the projects that had taken many manpower-months to build had to be suspended in July and August 1954, and more technical forces and more time were invested in surveying, testing the performance of clay and sand, and redesigning until construction resumed last September. Over the past year, the quality of the dam has been checked and tested and has fully met the required quality standards.

    Now, the people building the Dahuofang Reservoir are full of confidence and strength and want to build the dam to a height ahead of the flood season water level next year, and finally reach a height of 48 meters.

    大伙房水库介绍
    新华社记者　赵春烈
    大伙房水库工地上，27日是个不寻常的日子——水库拦河坝在这天合龙了。欢腾的人群，拥挤在三里长的大坝面前，观看着这条已被压缩成二十公尺宽的浑河水流，通过输水道流往下游。这条不断泛滥成灾的河流，将遵照人民的安排，为两岸的人民造福。
    浑河，不知给两岸人民带来过多少灾难。在这里的展览馆里，陈列了1937年的洪水灾情的资料，这次洪水淹没了三千多万亩田地，三十多万人受了灾。大伙房水库的建设，就是要挡住浑河百年不遇的大洪水。这个水库的建设不仅只是要挡住洪水，制止住浑河的灾害，还要利用水库的水流灌溉下游九十多万亩的田地。利用水库的水，可以供应沈阳、抚顺工业用水。利用水库的水发电、养鱼，供给沈阳、抚顺、本溪、鞍山的人们。这座水库是我国正在建设的最大的水库。
    现在，这座水库的雏型已经形成。从远处望去，三百公尺宽的拦河坝，从这岸的山头伸展到对岸的山头，又从对岸的山头，经过一道山沟连接起另一个山头。最高处已经修起十八、九公尺高。贯穿南岸山底的半圆形混凝土输水道有一里多长，进口处的闸门起闭塔，已经高高地越过了山顶好几丈。修建在浑河北岸的溢洪道，削平了山顶的半山腰，伸到了山底，它让最大的洪水溢到下游。
    大伙房水库的工地，和淮河、官厅水库、薄山水库、南湾水库等水利建设工地不同之处在于：这里工地上的机械化施工程度较高，工地上到处都是机器，这些机器日夜不停地运转着。长长行列的小火车从采砂船、挖土机装满了砂子、粘土奔驰到大坝下，皮带运输机顺着倾斜的坝坡，又把这些砂子、粘土送到大坝上，接着，推土机把砂和土散开，拖拉机、扬角碾来回的压碾着。在这里已经开始了我国在水利建设工程上采用机械化联合作业。大伙房水库工程局局长说：现在在这个大工地上工作的只有四万多人，假如没有机器至少得十万人。如果没有这些机器，大坝就不能这么快在今天合龙。
    大坝的合龙，标志着水库的诞生。可是，这个水库能建成这样，并不是一帆风顺的，这个水库在1953年开工后，就碰到很多困难和问题。用来砌防水心墙的粘土，含水量太高，碾压了六十多遍也压不结实，粘土像橡皮一样，这边压那边鼓起来，堆砌坝身用的砂子，细的怎么压也达不到设计上规定的标准，粗的不用压就和设计规定的标准一样，可是大坝又怎么能用砂子堆起来就成了呢！1954年水利部的人和苏联专家来到这里一看非常惊奇。追查原因，发现最初在勘测、土料试验上都作的非常粗糙，既不完整，又不准确，设计的错误也很多。在浑河下游有抚顺、沈阳两个工业城市，可是设计把大坝粘土心墙的质量规定的很低，很难保证这两个城市的安全。对砂子也不分粗细都规定了统一的质量标准，而且很多问题还是没有办法解决。结果，花费很多人力修建的好几个月的工程不得不在1954年7、8月间被迫停工，从新再投入更多的技术力量，花费更大的时间，进行勘测，试验粘土、砂子的性能，从新设计，直到去年9月才开始复工。这一年来，大坝的质量经过检查试验完全达到了应有的质量标准。
    现在，建设大伙房水库的人们充满信心和力量，要在明年把大坝建设高度赶在汛期水位的前面，最后达到四十八公尺高。
