    "Following the Wind"
    The houses of some workers at the Shanghai State-Owned Second Cotton Textile Factory were damaged by the typhoon. Some workers were capable of repairing them themselves, but they asked the trade union for help. Some workers even asked to borrow 500 or 1,000 yuan at a time, wanting the trade union to immediately help them rebuild their thatched houses into tile-roofed houses. These inappropriate demands are not difficult to explain to the workers. However, the trade union cadres felt these matters were very "difficult to handle."
    An employee of a plumbing and electrical shop, using the excuse that his wife had given birth, borrowed 30 yuan from the trade union, and applied for a subsidy of 30 yuan, adding the 10 yuan left from his salary, and deposited all of it in the bank. The trade union clearly knew these circumstances, but still approved the subsidy, and continued to subsidize him another 8 yuan the following month. Other workers were very dissatisfied; the trade union cadres said: "It's not good to be uncaring, it's better to care a little more."
    Why do these comrades feel that things that are easy to handle are "difficult to handle," and why do they "have to" care about things that should not be cared about? The reason is that "at this time, all aspects are criticizing the mistake of not caring about the lives of workers." These comrades are afraid of being labeled as "bureaucratic," and take a compromising attitude in everything they encounter. These people are like small grass on the wall, falling in the direction the wind blows. As for what kind of wind is blowing, and whether this kind of wind is suitable for the situation of their own unit, they don't care. They believe that as long as they follow the wind, they will be implementing the instructions of their superiors and will not be criticized. This is also a manifestation of irresponsibility.

    “刮风”
    上海国营第二棉纺织厂有些工人的住房被台风吹坏了。有的工人有能力自己修葺，却要求工会帮助。有的工人甚至要求一次借五百元、一千元，要工会马上帮助他把草房翻盖成瓦房。这些不恰当的要求，是不难向工人解释清楚的。但是，工会的干部觉得这些事很“难办”。
    有一个水电行的职工，借口妻子生小孩，向工会借了三十元，又申请补助三十元，加上自己工资里剩的十元，都存到了银行里。工会明明知道这些情形，仍然批准了补助，而且在下一个月又继续补助他八元。别的工人很不满意；工会干部却说：“不关心不好，只好多关心一些。”
    为什么本来好办的事，这些同志却觉得“难办”，本来不应该关心的事，却“只好”去关心呢？原来是因为“这时候各方面都在批判不关心工人生活的错误”，这些同志怕戴“官僚主义”的帽子，遇事就采取了迁就的态度。这些人好比墙头上的小草，风从哪里来，就顺哪里倒。至于刮的是什么风，这种风是否适合于本单位的情况，他们是不管的。他们认为只要顺风倒，就算贯彻上级的指示了，就不会受到指责了。这也是一种不负责任的表现。　正修
