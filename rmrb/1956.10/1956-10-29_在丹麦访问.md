Visiting Denmark
Zhao Dingyuan, Head of the Chinese Agricultural Observation Group

The Chinese Agricultural Observation Group, consisting of seven members, visited Denmark from June 11 to August 3, 1956. Thanks to the gracious hospitality of our hosts, we visited major towns and rural areas in Zealand, Funen, and Jutland during these fifty-four days. We visited 53 units, including the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural College, national research institutes for animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, and crop cultivation, various specialized experimental stations, agricultural associations, small farmers' associations and their experimental stations, agricultural schools, and both large and small farms. We also visited two agricultural and livestock exhibitions and several factories engaged in the manufacture of pesticides and dairy processing machinery that trade with China. During the visit, the Danish government and people received us warmly. Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hansen met with us, and Agriculture Minister Sm√∏rum arranged an observation program for us that included crops, animal husbandry, and education. Wherever we went, we were welcomed and received by local farmers and agricultural scientists. Friends who had visited China or traded with China were especially kind and enthusiastic, insisting on inviting us to visit and be their guests, some serving us Chinese tea and Chinese-style dishes to thank us for the hospitality they had received in China.

During this visit, in addition to focusing on learning from Denmark's good agricultural experiences, we also made extensive contact with the Danish agricultural community and related personnel. In practical contact and friendly conversations, a feeling of growing understanding and friendly cooperation between the people of China and Denmark permeated everywhere. Prime Minister Hansen welcomed the observation group's visit, saying, "Extremely good relations have always existed between Denmark and China, and I am confident that this visit will further strengthen this relationship." The Vice-Chairman of the Small Farmers' Association also said, "Increasing friendship and mutual understanding between the people of our two countries is our common desire. It is our greatest honor and pleasure to have Chinese friends with an ancient culture and who are rapidly developing come here to study and visit. We will keep your visit as a permanent and happy memory."

Denmark's natural conditions are very different from those of China. It is located between 54 and 58 degrees north latitude, with a maritime climate and high humidity. The average annual temperature is 7.5 degrees Celsius, with an average of 0 degrees Celsius in January and an average of 16 degrees Celsius in July. The absolute highest temperature is 30 degrees Celsius, and the lowest is minus 20 degrees Celsius. The annual precipitation is 625 mm, which is relatively evenly distributed, with approximately 64% of the precipitation falling between May and November. Although rivers are scarce and irrigation is rarely carried out, there is generally no serious threat of drought or flood during the crop growing season, and production is relatively stable. There are 1,700 hours of sunshine per year, with about two-thirds of it occurring between April and August. The frost-free period is 160 to 170 days, allowing for one crop per year.

Denmark's terrain is low and flat, with sandy loam soil in the east and loose sandy soil in the west. Arable land covers approximately three million hectares (equivalent to 45 million Chinese mu), accounting for approximately 73% of the total land area. Of the arable land, permanent grassland accounts for 12.5%, grain crops account for 43%, root crops (including potatoes) account for 18.5%, pasture accounts for 22.5%, and other crops and seeds account for 3.5%.

Denmark has 205,000 farm households, with an agricultural population of approximately 900,000, accounting for about 20% of the total national population of more than 4.5 million. Due to the scarcity of natural resources, with no coal, iron, or other minerals, agriculture has always occupied an absolutely important position in the national economy. Since 1880, influenced by the dumping of grain commodities on the European international market, livestock production has become the main direction of development for Danish agriculture. According to 1954 statistics, the country had 3,152,000 head of cattle (including 1,506,000 dairy cows), 4,879,000 pigs, and 25,234,000 chickens. Butter, cheese, bacon, and eggs are the most important exported agricultural and livestock products, and their total export value accounts for more than 60% of the country's total export value.

Danish agriculture and animal husbandry are indeed relatively developed. Looking at the unit yield of dairy cows, in 1954, the average annual milk production per cow was 3,500 kilograms, with a fat content of 4.05%, suitable for making butter and cheese. In terms of the yield per unit area of crops, wheat yields an average of 3,970 kilograms per hectare (equivalent to 529 jin per Chinese mu), barley yields an average of 3,650 kilograms per hectare (equivalent to 472 jin per Chinese mu), potatoes yield 19,350 kilograms per hectare (equivalent to 2,580 jin per Chinese mu), and sugar beets yield 33,125 kilograms per hectare (equivalent to 4,420 jin per Chinese mu). The total output of livestock products in 1950-1953 increased by an average of 1.37 times compared to 1900-1904, and the total output of crops in 1950-1953 increased by an average of 1.1 times compared to 1900-1904.

The reason for the development of Danish animal husbandry is mainly due to their diligent adoption of measures such as selecting and breeding improved breeds, preventing and controlling diseases, and improving feed, resulting in generally good yields and quality of livestock products, and the accumulation of considerable experience. For example, in the work of selecting and breeding superior livestock breeds, they have bred a red Danish cow with high milk production and high fat content to meet the needs of butter and cheese export; according to the international market's requirements for bacon quality, they have bred a Landrace white pig with a long body (about 94 cm), thin back fat (about 3.3 cm), and a high proportion of lean meat, which can generally grow to about 90 kg in six months. These improved breeds have been widely adopted in production. Red Danish cows account for 65% of the country's cattle herd, and Landrace white pigs have been basically popularized throughout the country. In order to continue to improve the quality of cattle and pig breeds, they have also established young pig and bull stations specifically for progeny testing and meticulous selection work. At the same time, exhibitions are held annually in various places to evaluate and compare superior livestock breeds, and to reward the public's enthusiasm for improving livestock breeds. In order to accelerate the breeding of superior livestock breeds, reduce production costs, and reduce disease, the technology of artificial insemination of cattle has also been vigorously promoted. Currently, this advanced technology has been widely used in more than 70% of the country's cattle herds.

Actively preventing and controlling livestock diseases is also extremely important for ensuring the increase in livestock product yield and quality. They have taken strict measures for inspection, prevention, and isolation and slaughter of diseased cattle for bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, which are widespread and harmful. Now, these diseases have been basically eliminated. We visited a cattle disease research institute where we observed their ongoing antibody reaction testing for brucellosis on almost all dairy cows in the country.

In terms of feeding management, they attach great importance to summer grazing and storing sufficient and good-quality forage and feed, especially expanding the utilization of various silage feeds. The quality of livestock feed is relatively high. For example, pig feed mainly consists of barley, oats, skim milk, and cooked potatoes, and is appropriately formulated according to the different stages of livestock growth, which has a good effect on promoting livestock development. Cattle and pig sheds are equipped with air and temperature control equipment to adapt to climate changes and improve livestock living conditions. Milking and dairy processing for dairy cows are also mostly mechanized. 80% of dairy cows in the country are milked using electric milking machines, which greatly saves labor.

Denmark's crop production is basically in service of livestock development. The main goal is to ensure a good supply of livestock feed, and the main crops grown are barley, oats, potatoes, sugar beets, pasture, swedes, wheat, and rye. Edible wheat only accounts for 2.46% of arable land, and rye only accounts for 2.83%. The proportion of high-yield root crops planted has increased significantly, from 2.5% in 1880 to 19% now. The planting area of barley, which has a high feed value, has also increased rapidly, increasing by 63% in 1954 compared to 1934-38.

They have actively adopted major measures such as fertilization, crop rotation, improved varieties, close planting, and disease and pest control, effectively increasing yield per unit area.

The development of animal husbandry has provided a large amount of livestock manure, creating favorable conditions for increasing crop production. They apply abundant farmyard manure in the fields, and also apply nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and other fertilizers according to different crops, soil chemical properties, and acid-base reactions. For root crops, they advocate applying more farmyard manure and topdressing with urine fertilizer or some chemical fertilizers, while for grain crops, they apply more chemical fertilizers. For example, wheat and barley are typically fertilized with 200-300 kg of nitrogen fertilizer (15%), 150-200 kg of potassium fertilizer (50%), and about 200 kg of phosphorus fertilizer (18%) per hectare. All farmland implements a certain crop rotation system. The most common is a seven- or eight-year rotation system, which involves planting grains for four years, pasture for two or three years, and root crops for one or two years, which is beneficial for improving soil fertility and preventing diseases, pests, and weeds. In order to rationally utilize land, they advocate planting crops according to local conditions. For example, fertile land is used to grow wheat and sugar beets, sandy land is used to grow potatoes, and poor land is used to grow oats or rye.

They also attach importance to the selection of improved varieties and seeds. The varieties of various crops generally undergo identification testing by national experimental stations. Grain crop varieties focus on selecting those with strong stalks, fertilizer resistance, and cold resistance. The quality of the varieties is relatively high. The seeds used for sowing are strictly selected and tested by seed companies or professional institutions, ensuring that the seeds are pure, uniform, and plump. Narrow-row close planting (row spacing of 10-12 cm) is commonly practiced for grain and pasture crops. The sowing rate of wheat and barley is approximately 200 kg per hectare (equivalent to more than 20 jin per Chinese mu), which has a significant effect in fully utilizing land, suppressing weed growth, and increasing yield per unit area. In terms of field cultivation, agricultural machinery has also increased, with more than 64,000 tractors currently in use. In order to further save labor and alleviate labor shortages, the work of chemical herbicide application is now beginning to be widely promoted. Because crop rotation is universally implemented, attention is paid to selecting disease-resistant varieties, a plant quarantine system has been established, and combined with the widespread use of chemical control, crop losses due to diseases and pests have been greatly reduced. They have made new achievements in the research of potato virus diseases.

While increasing yield per unit area, they also attach importance to the utilization of sand dunes, swampy areas, and coastal tidelands, and are trying to improve and utilize them as much as possible to compensate for the shortage of arable land.

In rural Denmark, small farmers (owner-operators) and large farmers (agricultural capitalists) each account for about half of the farm households. In addition, there are about 300,000 agricultural workers. Small farmers mostly participate in small farmers' associations, while large farmers mostly participate in agricultural associations. Farmers have all received seven years of universal education and have a certain level of literacy. The country also has 28 agricultural schools (including five small farmer schools), which provide farmers with formal short-term education, enabling young farmers to understand general agricultural science knowledge and making it easier for them to receive agricultural technical guidance. The Royal Veterinary and Agricultural College, the country's only national higher agricultural institution, requires students to have more than three years of practical agricultural experience as a condition for admission. After admission, emphasis is placed on theoretical learning, enabling them to further their studies and become practitioners' guides. In order to promote the increase in agricultural and livestock production, small farmers' associations and the Agricultural Council employ agricultural technology experts, with more than 600 nationwide (an average of three for every 1,000 farm households), who provide farmers with specialized technical guidance through exhibitions, lectures, reports, radio broadcasts, printed publications, and practical demonstrations.

The achievements of Danish agriculture and animal husbandry are inseparable from the efforts of Danish agricultural scientists. They have not only achieved considerable success in increasing crop and livestock yields and quality and improving varieties, but their spirit of diligent study is also relatively good. The agricultural experimental stations we visited all had specialized focus areas, clear divisions of labor, and although the personnel and equipment were relatively streamlined, the workload was large. In particular, the professional data and various experimental results studied by predecessors were made into various charts, which made it easy for visitors to understand at a glance. The results of each experiment were also clearly summarized, compiled into volumes, and widely disseminated to guide agricultural and livestock production.

The Danish people have a good impression of the diligence, bravery, intensive cultivation, and pig and poultry breeds of Chinese farmers. They have a great interest in the development of China's construction work in recent years. Every time we arrived at a place, we were surrounded by journalists who happily asked about various aspects of China's situation, and in the end, they felt that they had received satisfactory answers and gains. The local press reported on our activities almost daily, expressing welcome to the arrival of Chinese guests. Mr. Gr√∏nborg, the principal of Funen Small Farmers' School, and Mr. For. Biedesen, the principal of Dalum Agricultural School, who had visited China, praised the developing and vibrant new atmosphere they had personally seen and encountered in China in their articles in newspapers and when they met us, and believed that exchanges and cooperation with China must be strengthened. Mr. Hiek, the head of a sandy soil area experimental station and a member of parliament in Jutland, said when he parted with us, "The people of China and Denmark are peace-loving and free-loving. Our common task is to demand that we fully apply our knowledge under the premise of peace to serve the needs of the people's material life more fully. Your visit has brought encouragement, and may our mutual visits increase." Through our visit, we deeply felt the Danish people's sincere desire to promote mutual understanding and friendship between the two countries. Before we left Denmark, the Minister without Portfolio hosted a farewell banquet for us in the name of Prime Minister Hansen and expressed concern for China's agricultural production. The Minister of Agriculture also said at the farewell meeting: "I sincerely hope that your visit to Denmark has been rewarding and will help the development of Chinese agriculture. Your visits here have been so in-depth and interested, and so sincere, that they have left a deep impression on us." Similarly, our impression of Denmark is also good and unforgettable. We firmly believe that agricultural and other aspects of contact and cooperation between China and Denmark will develop and strengthen day by day.
