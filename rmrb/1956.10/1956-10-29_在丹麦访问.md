Visiting Denmark
Zhao Dingyuan, Head of the Chinese Agricultural Observation Group

The Chinese Agricultural Observation Group, consisting of seven members, visited Denmark from June 11 to August 3, 1956. Thanks to the gracious hospitality of our hosts, we visited major towns and rural areas in Zealand, Funen, and Jutland during these fifty-four days. We visited 53 units, including the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural College, national research institutes for animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, and crop cultivation, various specialized experimental stations, agricultural associations, small farmers' associations and their experimental stations, agricultural schools, and both large and small farms. We also visited two agricultural and livestock exhibitions and several factories engaged in the manufacture of pesticides and dairy processing machinery that trade with China. During the visit, the Danish government and people received us warmly. Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hansen met with us, and Agriculture Minister Smørum arranged an observation program for us that included crops, animal husbandry, and education. Wherever we went, we were welcomed and received by local farmers and agricultural scientists. Friends who had visited China or traded with China were especially kind and enthusiastic, insisting on inviting us to visit and be their guests, some serving us Chinese tea and Chinese-style dishes to thank us for the hospitality they had received in China.

During this visit, in addition to focusing on learning from Denmark's good agricultural experiences, we also made extensive contact with the Danish agricultural community and related personnel. In practical contact and friendly conversations, a feeling of growing understanding and friendly cooperation between the people of China and Denmark permeated everywhere. Prime Minister Hansen welcomed the observation group's visit, saying, "Extremely good relations have always existed between Denmark and China, and I am confident that this visit will further strengthen this relationship." The Vice-Chairman of the Small Farmers' Association also said, "Increasing friendship and mutual understanding between the people of our two countries is our common desire. It is our greatest honor and pleasure to have Chinese friends with an ancient culture and who are rapidly developing come here to study and visit. We will keep your visit as a permanent and happy memory."

Denmark's natural conditions are very different from those of China. It is located between 54 and 58 degrees north latitude, with a maritime climate and high humidity. The average annual temperature is 7.5 degrees Celsius, with an average of 0 degrees Celsius in January and an average of 16 degrees Celsius in July. The absolute highest temperature is 30 degrees Celsius, and the lowest is minus 20 degrees Celsius. The annual precipitation is 625 mm, which is relatively evenly distributed, with approximately 64% of the precipitation falling between May and November. Although rivers are scarce and irrigation is rarely carried out, there is generally no serious threat of drought or flood during the crop growing season, and production is relatively stable. There are 1,700 hours of sunshine per year, with about two-thirds of it occurring between April and August. The frost-free period is 160 to 170 days, allowing for one crop per year.

Denmark's terrain is low and flat, with sandy loam soil in the east and loose sandy soil in the west. Arable land covers approximately three million hectares (equivalent to 45 million Chinese mu), accounting for approximately 73% of the total land area. Of the arable land, permanent grassland accounts for 12.5%, grain crops account for 43%, root crops (including potatoes) account for 18.5%, pasture accounts for 22.5%, and other crops and seeds account for 3.5%.

Denmark has 205,000 farm households, with an agricultural population of approximately 900,000, accounting for about 20% of the total national population of more than 4.5 million. Due to the scarcity of natural resources, with no coal, iron, or other minerals, agriculture has always occupied an absolutely important position in the national economy. Since 1880, influenced by the dumping of grain commodities on the European international market, livestock production has become the main direction of development for Danish agriculture. According to 1954 statistics, the country had 3,152,000 head of cattle (including 1,506,000 dairy cows), 4,879,000 pigs, and 25,234,000 chickens. Butter, cheese, bacon, and eggs are the most important exported agricultural and livestock products, and their total export value accounts for more than 60% of the country's total export value.

Danish agriculture and animal husbandry are indeed relatively developed. Looking at the unit yield of dairy cows, in 1954, the average annual milk production per cow was 3,500 kilograms, with a fat content of 4.05%, suitable for making butter and cheese. In terms of the yield per unit area of crops, wheat yields an average of 3,970 kilograms per hectare (equivalent to 529 jin per Chinese mu), barley yields an average of 3,650 kilograms per hectare (equivalent to 472 jin per Chinese mu), potatoes yield 19,350 kilograms per hectare (equivalent to 2,580 jin per Chinese mu), and sugar beets yield 33,125 kilograms per hectare (equivalent to 4,420 jin per Chinese mu). The total output of livestock products in 1950-1953 increased by an average of 1.37 times compared to 1900-1904, and the total output of crops in 1950-1953 increased by an average of 1.1 times compared to 1900-1904.

The reason for the development of Danish animal husbandry is mainly due to their diligent adoption of measures such as selecting and breeding improved breeds, preventing and controlling diseases, and improving feed, resulting in generally good yields and quality of livestock products, and the accumulation of considerable experience. For example, in the work of selecting and breeding superior livestock breeds, they have bred a red Danish cow with high milk production and high fat content to meet the needs of butter and cheese export; according to the international market's requirements for bacon quality, they have bred a Landrace white pig with a long body (about 94 cm), thin back fat (about 3.3 cm), and a high proportion of lean meat, which can generally grow to about 90 kg in six months. These improved breeds have been widely adopted in production. Red Danish cows account for 65% of the country's cattle herd, and Landrace white pigs have been basically popularized throughout the country. In order to continue to improve the quality of cattle and pig breeds, they have also established young pig and bull stations specifically for progeny testing and meticulous selection work. At the same time, exhibitions are held annually in various places to evaluate and compare superior livestock breeds, and to reward the public's enthusiasm for improving livestock breeds. In order to accelerate the breeding of superior livestock breeds, reduce production costs, and reduce disease, the technology of artificial insemination of cattle has also been vigorously promoted. Currently, this advanced technology has been widely used in more than 70% of the country's cattle herds.

Actively preventing and controlling livestock diseases is also extremely important for ensuring the increase in livestock product yield and quality. They have taken strict measures for inspection, prevention, and isolation and slaughter of diseased cattle for bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, which are widespread and harmful. Now, these diseases have been basically eliminated. We visited a cattle disease research institute where we observed their ongoing antibody reaction testing for brucellosis on almost all dairy cows in the country.

In terms of feeding management, they attach great importance to summer grazing and storing sufficient and good-quality forage and feed, especially expanding the utilization of various silage feeds. The quality of livestock feed is relatively high. For example, pig feed mainly consists of barley, oats, skim milk, and cooked potatoes, and is appropriately formulated according to the different stages of livestock growth, which has a good effect on promoting livestock development. Cattle and pig sheds are equipped with air and temperature control equipment to adapt to climate changes and improve livestock living conditions. Milking and dairy processing for dairy cows are also mostly mechanized. 80% of dairy cows in the country are milked using electric milking machines, which greatly saves labor.

Denmark's crop production is basically in service of livestock development. The main goal is to ensure a good supply of livestock feed, and the main crops grown are barley, oats, potatoes, sugar beets, pasture, swedes, wheat, and rye. Edible wheat only accounts for 2.46% of arable land, and rye only accounts for 2.83%. The proportion of high-yield root crops planted has increased significantly, from 2.5% in 1880 to 19% now. The planting area of barley, which has a high feed value, has also increased rapidly, increasing by 63% in 1954 compared to 1934-38.

They have actively adopted major measures such as fertilization, crop rotation, improved varieties, close planting, and disease and pest control, effectively increasing yield per unit area.

The development of animal husbandry has provided a large amount of livestock manure, creating favorable conditions for increasing crop production. They apply abundant farmyard manure in the fields, and also apply nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and other fertilizers according to different crops, soil chemical properties, and acid-base reactions. For root crops, they advocate applying more farmyard manure and topdressing with urine fertilizer or some chemical fertilizers, while for grain crops, they apply more chemical fertilizers. For example, wheat and barley are typically fertilized with 200-300 kg of nitrogen fertilizer (15%), 150-200 kg of potassium fertilizer (50%), and about 200 kg of phosphorus fertilizer (18%) per hectare. All farmland implements a certain crop rotation system. The most common is a seven- or eight-year rotation system, which involves planting grains for four years, pasture for two or three years, and root crops for one or two years, which is beneficial for improving soil fertility and preventing diseases, pests, and weeds. In order to rationally utilize land, they advocate planting crops according to local conditions. For example, fertile land is used to grow wheat and sugar beets, sandy land is used to grow potatoes, and poor land is used to grow oats or rye.

They also attach importance to the selection of improved varieties and seeds. The varieties of various crops generally undergo identification testing by national experimental stations. Grain crop varieties focus on selecting those with strong stalks, fertilizer resistance, and cold resistance. The quality of the varieties is relatively high. The seeds used for sowing are strictly selected and tested by seed companies or professional institutions, ensuring that the seeds are pure, uniform, and plump. Narrow-row close planting (row spacing of 10-12 cm) is commonly practiced for grain and pasture crops. The sowing rate of wheat and barley is approximately 200 kg per hectare (equivalent to more than 20 jin per Chinese mu), which has a significant effect in fully utilizing land, suppressing weed growth, and increasing yield per unit area. In terms of field cultivation, agricultural machinery has also increased, with more than 64,000 tractors currently in use. In order to further save labor and alleviate labor shortages, the work of chemical herbicide application is now beginning to be widely promoted. Because crop rotation is universally implemented, attention is paid to selecting disease-resistant varieties, a plant quarantine system has been established, and combined with the widespread use of chemical control, crop losses due to diseases and pests have been greatly reduced. They have made new achievements in the research of potato virus diseases.

While increasing yield per unit area, they also attach importance to the utilization of sand dunes, swampy areas, and coastal tidelands, and are trying to improve and utilize them as much as possible to compensate for the shortage of arable land.

In rural Denmark, small farmers (owner-operators) and large farmers (agricultural capitalists) each account for about half of the farm households. In addition, there are about 300,000 agricultural workers. Small farmers mostly participate in small farmers' associations, while large farmers mostly participate in agricultural associations. Farmers have all received seven years of universal education and have a certain level of literacy. The country also has 28 agricultural schools (including five small farmer schools), which provide farmers with formal short-term education, enabling young farmers to understand general agricultural science knowledge and making it easier for them to receive agricultural technical guidance. The Royal Veterinary and Agricultural College, the country's only national higher agricultural institution, requires students to have more than three years of practical agricultural experience as a condition for admission. After admission, emphasis is placed on theoretical learning, enabling them to further their studies and become practitioners' guides. In order to promote the increase in agricultural and livestock production, small farmers' associations and the Agricultural Council employ agricultural technology experts, with more than 600 nationwide (an average of three for every 1,000 farm households), who provide farmers with specialized technical guidance through exhibitions, lectures, reports, radio broadcasts, printed publications, and practical demonstrations.

The achievements of Danish agriculture and animal husbandry are inseparable from the efforts of Danish agricultural scientists. They have not only achieved considerable success in increasing crop and livestock yields and quality and improving varieties, but their spirit of diligent study is also relatively good. The agricultural experimental stations we visited all had specialized focus areas, clear divisions of labor, and although the personnel and equipment were relatively streamlined, the workload was large. In particular, the professional data and various experimental results studied by predecessors were made into various charts, which made it easy for visitors to understand at a glance. The results of each experiment were also clearly summarized, compiled into volumes, and widely disseminated to guide agricultural and livestock production.

The Danish people have a good impression of the diligence, bravery, intensive cultivation, and pig and poultry breeds of Chinese farmers. They have a great interest in the development of China's construction work in recent years. Every time we arrived at a place, we were surrounded by journalists who happily asked about various aspects of China's situation, and in the end, they felt that they had received satisfactory answers and gains. The local press reported on our activities almost daily, expressing welcome to the arrival of Chinese guests. Mr. Grønborg, the principal of Funen Small Farmers' School, and Mr. For. Biedesen, the principal of Dalum Agricultural School, who had visited China, praised the developing and vibrant new atmosphere they had personally seen and encountered in China in their articles in newspapers and when they met us, and believed that exchanges and cooperation with China must be strengthened. Mr. Hiek, the head of a sandy soil area experimental station and a member of parliament in Jutland, said when he parted with us, "The people of China and Denmark are peace-loving and free-loving. Our common task is to demand that we fully apply our knowledge under the premise of peace to serve the needs of the people's material life more fully. Your visit has brought encouragement, and may our mutual visits increase." Through our visit, we deeply felt the Danish people's sincere desire to promote mutual understanding and friendship between the two countries. Before we left Denmark, the Minister without Portfolio hosted a farewell banquet for us in the name of Prime Minister Hansen and expressed concern for China's agricultural production. The Minister of Agriculture also said at the farewell meeting: "I sincerely hope that your visit to Denmark has been rewarding and will help the development of Chinese agriculture. Your visits here have been so in-depth and interested, and so sincere, that they have left a deep impression on us." Similarly, our impression of Denmark is also good and unforgettable. We firmly believe that agricultural and other aspects of contact and cooperation between China and Denmark will develop and strengthen day by day.

    在丹麦访问
    中国农业考察团团长　赵定远
    中国农业考察团一行七人，于1956年6月11日至8月3日在丹麦进行访问。由于主人的盛意，在这五十四天中，我们到了西兰岛、菲英岛、日德兰半岛的主要城镇和农村，访问了皇家兽医农业学院、国家畜牧兽医、作物栽培方面的研究所和各种专业试验站、农业协会、小农协会和他们的试验站，农业学校、大小农户等五十三个单位；还参观了两个农牧展览会和几个与中国有贸易关系的农药和乳品加工机械制造等工厂。在访问期间，丹麦政府和人民对我们的接待是友好的。首相兼外交大臣汉森先生曾接见了我们，农业大臣斯莫伦先生给我们安排了包括农作物、畜牧、教育等内容的考察计划。我们所到各地，都受到了当地农户和农业科学工作者的欢迎和接待，到过中国的或同中国作买卖的一些朋友们更是亲切和热情，一定要邀我们前去参观作客，有的用中国茶和中国风味的菜来招待我们，以答谢他们在中国受到的款待。
    这次访问，我们除了着重学习丹麦农业上好的经验外，还广泛地与丹麦农业界和有关人士作了接触。在实际接触和友好的交谈中，到处洋溢了中丹两国人民日益发展着的了解和友好合作的感情。汉森首相对考察团的访问表示欢迎说：“丹麦和中国之间一直存在着极为良好的关系，深信这次访问将进一步加强这种关系。”小农协会的副主席也说：“增进两国人民之间的友谊和相互了解是我们共同的愿望，具有古老文化的、正在迅速发展着的中国朋友们来到这里学习和访问，是我们最大的光荣与愉快，我们将把你们的访问作为永久的快乐的回忆。”
    丹麦的自然条件与中国是有很大不同的。它位于北纬五十四至五十八度，海洋性气候，湿度较大，全年平均温度为摄氏7.5度，1月平均为零度，7月平均为十六度，绝对最高温度为三十度，最低是零下二十度。全年降水量六百二十五公厘，分布比较均匀，5至11月的降水量约占64％。虽然河流缺乏，极少进行灌溉，但作物生长季节一般没有严重水旱灾害威胁，生产比较稳定。全年的日照为一千七百小时，4至8月约占三分之二，无霜期一百六十至一百七十天，1年栽种一季农作物。
    丹麦的地势低平，东部多砂质壤土，西部多轻松砂土，耕地面积约三百万公顷（合中国四千五百万市亩）约占土地总面积的73％，耕地中固定草地占12.5％，谷类作物占43％，根类（包括马铃薯）占18.5％，牧草占22.5％，其他作物和种子占3.5％。
    丹麦的农户有二十万五千个，农业人口约有九十万，占全国总人口四百五十多万的20％左右。由于自然资源贫乏，没有煤铁和其他矿产，农业始终在国民经济中占着绝对重要的地位。1880年以来，受到了欧洲国际市场上谷物商品倾销的影响，畜牧业生产成了丹麦农业的主要发展方向。根据1954年统计：全国有牛三百一十五点二万头（其中乳牛一百五十点六万头），猪四百八十七点九万头，鸡二千五百二十三点四万头。黄油、乳酪、咸肉和鸡蛋等是最主要的出口农畜产品，它们的出口总值占全国出口总产值的60％以上。
    丹麦的农牧业的确是比较发达的。从乳牛的单位产量来看，1954年每头平均年产乳量是三千五百公斤，脂肪含量达4.05％，适宜于做黄油与乳酪。拿农作物的单位面积产量来说，小麦每公顷平均产三千九百七十公斤（合中国每市亩五百二十九斤），大麦每公顷平均产三千六百五十公斤（合中国每市亩四百七十二斤），马铃薯每公顷产一万九千三百五十公斤（合中国每市亩二千五百八十斤），甜菜每公顷产三万三千一百二十五公斤（合中国每市亩四千四百二十斤）。畜牧产品总量1950—1953年比1900—1904年平均增加一点三七倍，农作物生产总量1950—1953年比1900—1904年平均增加一点一倍。
    丹麦畜牧业所以发展的原因，主要是由于他们辛勤地采取了选育良种、防治疫病、改良饲料等措施，因而畜产品的产量与质量一般都是较好的，积累的经验也是不少的。如在选育优良种畜的工作上，他们根据制造黄油和乳酪出口的需要，选育出了一种产乳量较高，含脂肪量多的红丹麦牛；根据国际市场对咸肉品质的要求，选育出了一种体型长（约九十四公分）背油薄（约三点三公分）瘦肉多的兰德瑞斯白猪，一般饲养六个月，即可长到九十公斤左右。这些良种已经在生产中广泛采用。红丹麦牛已占全国牛群的65％，兰德瑞斯白猪在全国基本上普及。为继续提高牛、猪的品种的质量，他们还专门建立了幼猪和公牛站，进行后代测验和细致的选择工作。同时，每年在各地举行展览会评比优良种畜，奖励群众对改良种畜的积极性。为了加速繁殖优良种畜，降低生产成本、减少疫病，还大力推广了牛的人工授精技术，目前全国已有70％以上的牛群广泛应用了这一先进的技术。
    积极防治牲畜病害，对于保证畜产品产量和质量的提高也是极其重要的。他们对发生普遍而为害较大的乳牛结核病，流产病，采取了严格的检查预防和病牛隔离屠宰等办法。现在，这些疾病已经基本上消灭了。我们曾在一个牛病的研究所里参观了他们进行着的对几乎全国所有乳牛的流产病的抗体反应检验工作。
    在饲养管理方面，他们十分重视夏季放牧和贮备充足和良好的饲草和饲料，尤其是扩大各种青贮饲料的利用。牲畜饲料的质量都是比较高的，如猪的饲料主要是大麦、燕麦、脱脂牛乳和煮熟的马铃薯，而且是根据牲畜的生育不同阶段进行适当的配合，这对于促进牲畜的发育起了良好作用。牛舍和猪舍都装有调节空气和温度的设备，来适应气候的变化和改善牲畜生活条件。乳牛的挤乳和乳品处理，大部也都实行机械化了，全国有80％的乳牛采用电器挤乳，这就大大节省了劳动力。
    丹麦农作物的生产基本上是为畜牧业发展服务的。主要是保证牲畜饲料的良好供应，栽培的主要作物是大麦、燕麦、马铃薯、甜菜、牧草、芜菁、小麦和黑麦。而食用的小麦只占耕地的2.46％，黑麦只占2.83％，高产量的根类作物种植比重有了显著增长，已由1880年的2.5％增加到现在的19％。饲料价值较高的大麦种植面积也有迅速增加，如1954年即比1934—38年增加了63％。
    他们积极的采用了施肥、轮作、良种、密植、防治病虫害等主要措施，有效地提高了单位面积产量。
    畜牧业的发展，提供了大量的牲畜粪尿，为农作物增产创造了有利条件。他们在田间施有丰富的厩肥，还根据不同作物和土壤化学性质、酸硷度反应，施用氮、磷、钾、钙等肥料。对于根类作物提倡多施厩肥和追施尿肥或一些化学肥料，对于谷类作物则多施化学肥料，如小麦和大麦通常每公顷施氮肥（15％）二百至三百公斤，钾肥（50％）一百五十至二百公斤，磷肥（18％）约二百公斤。所有农地都实行一定的轮作制度，最普遍的是七年或八年的轮作制，就是种四年谷物，二、三年牧草，一、二年的根类作物，这对提高地力、防除病虫害和杂草都有好处。为了合理利用土地，他们提倡因地种植，如肥地种小麦、甜菜，砂地种马铃薯，瘠薄地种燕麦或黑麦等。
    他们对选择优良品种和种子的工作也是重视的。各种作物的品种一般都经过国家试验站进行过鉴定试验的，谷类作物品种着重选择具有基秆粗壮、耐肥、耐寒等优良的特性，品种质量都是较高的。播种用的种子都由种子公司或专业机构做严格的精选和检验工作，籽粒纯洁、整齐、饱满。谷类和牧草作物普遍实行窄行密植（行距十至十二公分），小麦、大麦的播种量每公顷约二百公斤（合中国每市亩二十多斤），在充分利用土地，抑制杂草生长，提高单位面积产量方面有显著作用。在田间耕作上，农业机械也增加了，现有拖拉机即达六万四千多台。为了进一步节省劳动力、减少劳动力不足的困难，现在正开始大量推广化学药剂除草的工作。因为普遍实行了轮作、注意选育抗病品种，建立植物检易制度，结合广泛利用药剂防治，农作物受病虫害的损失大大地减少了。他们在马铃薯毒素病的研究工作上取得了新的成就。
    在提高单位面积产量的同时，他们对于沙丘、沼泽地区和沿海滩地的利用也是重视的，正在尽量设法加以改良和利用，以补耕地不足。
    丹麦农村中有小农（自耕农）和大农（农业资本家）约各占农户的一半，另外有农业工人约三十万人。小农多参加小农协会，大农多参加农业协会。农民都受过七年普及教育，有一定的文化水平，全国还设有二十八个农业学校（其中包括小农学校五所），对农民进行正规化的短期教育，使青年农民得以了解一般的农业科学知识，便于接受农业技术指导。全国唯一的国家高等农业学府——皇家兽医农业学院，对学生入学条件上要求是必须有三年以上的农业实践经验，入学后强调理论学习，使他们进修深造，成为实践的指导者。为了推动农牧业的增产，小农协会和农业理事会都聘有农业技术的专家，全国有六百多个，分布各地（平均每一千个农户有三个），通过展览会、演讲、报告、广播、印刷刊物、实际示范等不同方式，对农民进行专业的技术指导。
    丹麦的农牧业所以获得成就，是与丹麦农业科学工作者的努力分不开的。他们不仅在提高农作物和畜牧产量和质量以及改良品种方面获得了不少成绩，而且刻苦钻研的精神也是比较好的。我们所参观过的农业试验站都有专业的重点、明确分工，人员和设备虽是比较精简，但工作量是多的，尤其是对前人所研究的专业资料和各项试验成果都制成了各种图表，可以使参观者一目了然，对各个试验的结果也都有明确的总结，编印成册，广为传播，以指导农牧业的生产。
    丹麦人民对于我国农民的勤劳、勇敢、精耕细作以及猪、家禽等品种有着良好的印象。他们对于中国近年来建设工作的发展寄以很大的兴趣。当我们每到一个地方，总是被新闻记者围着高兴地询问中国各方面的情况，最后都感到有了满意的答复与收获。地方的新闻界几乎每日都报道了我们活动的情况，表示欢迎中国客人们的来临。曾经访问过中国的菲英岛小农学校校长格仑堡先生和达隆农业学校校长福·比德森先生，在报纸上著文和见到我们时，都赞扬在中国亲眼看到和接触到的发展着的、蓬勃动人的新气象；并认为必须加强与中国的来往和合作。在日德兰半岛的一位砂土地区试验站站长、国会议员希克先生与我们离别时说：“中国和丹麦的人民是爱好和平和自由的，我们的共同任务就是要求在一个和平的前提下充分应用我们的知识，为更多地满足人民物质生活需要而服务，你们的来访带来了鼓舞，愿我们相互间的访问越来越多。”通过访问，我们深切体会到丹麦人民对促进两国相互了解与友谊的衷心愿望。在我们离开丹麦前，不管部大臣以汉森首相的名义宴送我们，并对中国的农业生产表示关怀。农业大臣在告别会上也说：“我衷心希望你们在丹麦的参观有所收获，有助于中国农业的发展。你们在这里的访问这样深入而有兴趣，以及这样的真诚，都给我们留下了深刻的印象”。同样的，我们对丹麦的印象也是良好的，令人难忘的，我们深信中丹两国间的农业和其他方面的联系合作，将会日益发展与加强。
