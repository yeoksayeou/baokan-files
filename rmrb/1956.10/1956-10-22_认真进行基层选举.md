    Conscientiously Conduct Grassroots Elections

Currently, 821 counties and cities across the country are conducting grassroots election work, with a small number of places having already completed it. Many grassroots units have greatly stimulated and encouraged the political and production enthusiasm of the broad masses through election work, and further strengthened the ties between the government and the people.

However, the election work in a considerable number of grassroots units is not being carried out well. The prominent shortcomings are acting rashly, not truly promoting democracy, and being seriously divorced from the masses. The emergence of this shortcoming is related to the insufficient understanding and lack of attention to this year's election work by some of our cadres, and even some leading cadres.

Some cadres mistakenly believe that elections are merely a "routine system," and therefore adopt a passive and perfunctory attitude. The State Council's approved and transmitted opinion from the Ministry of Internal Affairs on this year's grassroots election work solemnly pointed out: "Electoral work should not be seen merely as the implementation of a routine system, but should be seen as a major political driving force for socialist construction. Through this election, we should further give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the people, so as to implement the spirit of 'mobilizing all forces to serve socialism,' improve the work efficiency of the government, especially the grassroots government, strengthen the ties between the government and the people, and further overcome and prevent bureaucracy and commandism in our work." Some cadres lack understanding of this instruction, and therefore, in the elections, they have not mobilized the people to fully exercise their solemn right to participate in state management and regularly check the work of the government and the style of cadres, and have not mobilized the masses to conduct serious supervision of the grassroots regime.

The State Council's instructions require that election work "strive to be simple and practical." This is correct. Our elections are fundamentally different from the bourgeoisie's red tape and formalistic, hypocritical democracy. However, some cadres have misunderstood the spirit of the State Council's instructions, and they have carried out harsh "streamlining" of election work, cutting out the vivid democratic content and leaving only a bit of democratic form. Some places, "in order to complete the election task ahead of schedule," even dispensed with some democratic formalities. Suji Township, the pilot township in Jining County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, in order to implement the spirit of "simplicity," the county instructed the pilot work team to complete all election work in 15 days; the work team then proposed a plan to complete the election in seven days, and later the district-level leading organs instructed that the faster the time, the better, so that some electoral districts "completed the election task" in one and a half days.

This phenomenon is not isolated. Some are even worse than the above examples. Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, arranged for all grassroots election work in the county to be completed in nine days, so the county generally conducted elections without voter registration; Linchuan, Chongren, Lianhua and other counties also used the method of performing operas to gather voters for elections.

Can it be said that the cadres in these areas are leading the masses to carry out democratic election work? This is to trifle with the people's right to vote! It is to trifle with the people's democratic legal system and the instructions of the State Council! The masses criticize this practice as "formalism," and this criticism is very correct.

The phenomenon of acting rashly in election work is also manifested in the process of reviewing voter qualifications. Some places have adopted a simplified method, depriving alternate members of agricultural producers' cooperatives of the right to vote, and not changing the status of landlord elements and other elements who meet the conditions for changing their status. Conversely, some places have granted landlord elements and others the right to vote in batches without careful examination. Both of these practices are wrong. We cannot endorse "rather left than right," nor can we endorse "rather right than left." The review of voter qualifications must be strictly determined in accordance with the law, and it must be ensured that "no one who should have the right to vote is wrongly deprived of the solemn right to vote, nor should anyone who should not have the right to vote steal the solemn right to vote."

Some cadres, especially some grassroots cadres, say: "If production is not done well, this is a principled error; if the election is not done well, it is at most a work defect." It seems that election work can be sloppy. This view is completely wrong.

The facts of many pilot townships where election work has been done well prove that doing a good job in elections can further improve production. Voters are most concerned about production issues, they cherish cadres who can help them improve production, and they dislike things that cannot help or even hinder their production. In the grassroots elections in Zaoyuan Township, Yan'an, the masses put forward more than 400 opinions, seriously examined the work of the government, and pointed out that after the cooperative transformation, township cadres only talked to cooperative cadres when they went to the villages, and did not approach other people. Thirty-seven households in Liujiahe Village were short of food, and more than 90 single-peasant households in the township had difficulties in production, and the township cadres took an indifferent attitude. When the voter groups discussed the candidates for representatives, the election committee originally proposed that the director of the co-op, Li Zhixiu, was not approved because the voters thought that Li Zhixiu was acting out of favoritism and was not democratic, so they proposed Li Fengcai, the vice director of the co-op, who was active in production and could do things for everyone, as a candidate. When discussing whether the former representative, single peasant He Jiafu, could be a candidate, the voters said: To elect a representative is to elect a leader on the socialist road, and he is a representative but does not join the co-op, so we will not elect him this time. The work team that did the pilot election work in Zaoyuan Township deeply realized that the nomination of candidates for representatives should be from bottom to top, from mass organizations, from voters jointly or individually, and should not only be proposed by the above; the official list of candidates should be based on the results of the discussion of the voter groups, summarized and studied, and proposed according to the opinions of the majority of the masses. Zaoyuan Township did this, and as a result, 15 of the 29 new representatives elected in the township were activists who had emerged in the new upsurge of cooperation. Some of the original representatives made profound self-criticisms in various electoral districts and were still elected, while those who were not satisfied by the masses were defeated. After the election, production in Zaoyuan Township showed even greater progress than before.

It can be seen from this that only through examining the work of the government and the style of cadres in the election process, especially examining the organization and leadership of production in the past, can production work be further improved.

As for saying that elections should not hinder production, that refers to the busy farming season. The "Instructions of the Central Election Committee on Grassroots Election Work" also said: "All activities related to elections, such as publicity, investigation and registration, voter group meetings, and election meetings, must seize the time, make use of the gaps, avoid extravagance, and ensure that agricultural time is not violated." But this must not be used as the basis for the statement that elections are opposed to production.

Some places are afraid that voters' examination of government work and criticism of the style of cadres will cause chaos, and are afraid of "hurting the enthusiasm of cadres," and they say that they must "protect cadres" in the elections, which is obviously wrong. Fearing "hurting the enthusiasm of cadres" and not fully promoting democracy will inevitably hurt the enthusiasm of the people. And the "protected" cadres, because they cannot receive profound democratic education in the elections, cannot improve their style, and may even increase negative factors. This practice is harmful and has no benefits.

The facts of many pilot townships show that when the masses examine the work of the government, they first of all satisfiedly recount the great achievements of the Party and the People's Government in leading the peasants to realize agricultural cooperation, launching production campaigns, and overcoming natural disasters in the past two years or more; at the same time, the masses also put forward solemn criticisms of the pride and complacency, bureaucracy and commandism generated by the cadres after the cooperative movement, as well as other phenomena that are divorced from reality and divorced from the masses. Aren't these shortcomings in the government's work and the ideological style of cadres precisely caused by the lack of strict supervision by the people? Isn't it a good opportunity to let the masses expose these shortcomings and supervise their correction through elections? Anyone who wants to truly care for cadres, enable them to correct their shortcomings and grow up healthily, should support the legitimate supervision and criticism of the masses.

Some of the shortcomings and mistakes that occur in the work of grassroots cadres are the responsibility of the bureaucratic leadership of higher-level organs. Because the masses directly contact grassroots cadres, their criticisms of shortcomings and mistakes in work inevitably have to be directed at grassroots cadres. This may make some grassroots cadres "unable to bear it" for a while. This requires the leading organs above the county and district levels to analyze the criticisms and opinions put forward by the masses in a realistic manner. Distinguish right from wrong, distinguish responsibilities, and if the higher level is responsible, the higher level should examine and correct it, and if the grassroots cadres themselves are responsible, they should examine and correct it themselves. I remember that in the township elections in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in 1945, the voters put forward tens of thousands of opinions. The Border Region Government's report to the Senate stated: "The people's criticism of districts and townships is a criticism of the Border Region Government, and the people's suggestions to districts and townships are suggestions to the Border Region Government. This is a mirror, and the personnel of the higher-level government should all come to look at themselves." The instructions of the Central Election Committee said that "all cadres should receive a profound education under the discernment of the masses," which is the same meaning.

At present, most grassroots election work is underway. Therefore, the most important thing now is: Party and government organs at all levels, especially at the county level, must strengthen leadership, properly summarize and promote the good experience of election pilots, fully promote democracy, prevent and correct any perfunctory phenomena, and not only ensure that the election work is completed within the time stipulated by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, but also ensure that the election work is done very well.

### 认真进行基层选举

    认真进行基层选举
    目前，全国有八百二十一个县、市正在进行基层选举工作，有少数地方已经完成。很多基层单位通过选举工作，大大地发挥和鼓舞了广大人民的政治积极性和生产积极性，进一步密切了政府同群众的联系。
    但是，也还有相当数量的基层单位的选举工作是进行得不好的。突出的缺点是草率从事，没有真正发扬民主，严重地脱离了群众。这个缺点的产生，是同我们一部分干部甚至一些领导干部对今年选举工作的认识不足和重视不够有关。
    有些干部错误地认为，选举只不过是“例行制度”，因而抱消极应付的态度。国务院批转的内务部对今年基层选举工作的意见中曾郑重地指出：“不应该把选举工作仅仅看作是例行制度的执行，而应该把它看作是一种进行社会主义建设的重大的政治推动力。应该通过这一次选举，进一步发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性，以贯彻‘调动一切力量为社会主义服务’的精神，提高政府、特别是基层政府的工作效率，密切政府同人民群众的联系，进一步克服和防止工作中的官僚主义和强迫命令作风。”有些干部对于这个指示缺乏了解，因而在选举中，就没有发动人民群众充分行使他们参加国家管理、定期对政府工作和干部作风进行检查的庄严的权利，没有发动群众对基层政权进行认真的监督。
    国务院指示中要求选举工作“力求简便和切合实际”。这是对的。我们的选举是同资产阶级的繁文缛节、只有形式的虚伪民主有根本区别的。但是，有些干部把国务院指示的精神理解错了，他们对选举工作进行了苛刻的“精简”，削掉了生动的民主内容，留下了一点民主形式。有些地方“为了提前完成选举任务”，甚至连一些民主的形式也不要了。内蒙古自治区集宁县的试点乡——苏集乡，为了贯彻“简便”的精神，县指示试点工作组要十五天完成全部选举工作；工作组就提出了七天完成选举的计划，后来区级领导机关又指示在时间上愈快愈好，以致有的选区在一天半的时间内就全部“完成了选举任务”。
    这种现象并不是个别的。有的甚至比上述的例子还坏。江西省南丰县布置全县基层选举工作在九天内完成，因而这个县普遍未进行选民登记工作就进行了选举；临川、崇仁、莲花等县还有用唱戏的办法集中选民进行选举的。
    能说这些地区的干部是在领导群众进行民主的选举工作吗？这是在玩忽人民的选举权利！是玩忽人民民主法制和国务院的指示！群众批评这种做法是“形式主义”，这个批评很对。
    选举工作中草率从事的现象还表现在对选民资格的审查过程中。有的地方采取了简单化的方法，对农业生产合作社的候补社员一律剥夺选举权利，对于具备了改变成分条件的地主分子和其他分子，也不予以改变成分。相反，有的地方不经认真审查，就成批地给予地主分子等以选举权利。这两种作法都是不对的。我们既不能赞成“宁左勿右”，也不能赞成“宁右勿左”。审查选民资格必须严格地按照法律来确定，必须做到“不让一个应该有选举权利的人被错误地剥夺了庄严的选举权利，也不让一个不应该有选举权利的人窃取了庄严的选举权利”。
    有些干部，特别是有些基层干部这样说：“生产搞不好，这是原则错误；选举搞不好，顶多是个工作缺点”。似乎选举工作可以马虎一点。这种看法完全错误。
    许多选举工作做得好的试点乡的事实证明，搞好选举，才能进一步搞好生产。选民最关心的是生产问题，他们最爱护能帮助他们搞好生产的干部，最不喜欢的是不能帮助甚至妨碍他们生产的事情。延安枣园乡在基层选举中，群众提出四百多条意见，认真地检查了政府的工作，指出合作化以后乡干部到村只找合作社干部谈，不接近其他群众。刘家河村有三十七户缺粮，全乡有九十多户单干农民生产有困难，乡干部采取漠不关心的态度。在选民小组讨论代表候选人的时候，选举委员会原先提出社长李之秀没有通过，选民认为李之秀耍私情、不民主，他们另提出生产积极、能为大家办事的副社长李丰财为候选人。在讨论原任代表单干农民贺家福是否可以作候选人的时候，选民说：选代表是选社会主义带路人，他是代表却不入社，这次我们不选他。枣园乡做试点选举的工作组，深刻认识了代表候选人的提名，应该由下而上，由群众团体提，由选民联合或单独提，而不应只由上面提；正式候选人名单，应根据选民小组讨论的结果，汇总研究，按照最多数群众的意见提出。枣园乡这样做了，结果全乡选出的二十九名新代表中就有十五个是合作化高潮中新涌出的积极分子。原有代表有的到各选区作了深刻的检讨，仍然当选了，而群众所不满意的人落选了。选举以后，枣园乡的生产就出现了比以前更进步的现象。　
    由此可见，只有在选举过程中通过检查政府工作和干部作风，特别是检查过去对生产的组织和领导，才会使生产工作能得到进一步的改善。
    至于说选举不要妨碍生产，那是指农忙时候。“中央选举委员会关于基层选举工作的指示”中也说：“所有有关选举的宣传、调查登记、选民小组会议及选举大会等一系列的活动，都须抓紧时间，利用空隙，切忌铺张，保证不违农时。”但这决不能作为把选举同生产对立的说法的根据。
    有些地方怕选民检查政府工作和批评干部作风会引起混乱，怕“伤害干部的积极性”，他们说在选举中要“保护干部”，这显然也是错误的。怕“伤害干部的积极性”而不去充分发扬民主，势必要伤害人民群众的积极性。而被“保护”的干部，由于他们在选举中不能受到深刻的民主教育，也就不能改进作风，甚至会增加消极因素。这种作法有百害而无一利。
    许多试点乡的事实表明，群众在检查政府工作的时候，都首先满意地讲述着党和人民政府在这二年多以来领导农民实现农业的合作化、发动生产运动和战胜灾荒等等方面的伟大成就；同时，群众对干部在合作化运动以后产生的骄傲自满情绪、官僚主义和强迫命令作风，以及对其他脱离实际、脱离群众的现象，也提出严正的批评。政府工作和干部思想作风上的这些缺点，不正是因为缺乏人民群众的严格监督才产生的吗？通过选举让群众来揭发这些缺点，监督纠正，这不正是良好的时机吗？谁要是想真正爱护干部、使干部改正缺点、健全地成长起来，他就应该支持群众正当的监督和批评。
    基层干部在工作中发生的缺点和错误，有些是要由上级机关的官僚主义领导负责的。群众因为直接接触基层干部，对工作中的缺点和错误的批评，难免都要向基层干部提出。这就可能使某些基层干部一时“受不了”。这就要求县、区以上的领导机关，实事求是地分析群众提出的批评和意见。分清是非，分清责任，该由上级负责的上级要检讨纠正，该由基层干部本人负责的就由他们本人检讨改正。记得1945年陕甘宁边区的乡选，选民提出了几万条意见。边区政府向参议会的报告说：“人民批评区乡，即是批评边区政府，人民向区乡建议即是向边区政府建议。这是一面镜子，上级政府人员应该大家来照照自己”。中央选举委员会的指示说要“使所有干部都能在群众的鉴别下受到一次深刻的教育”，也就是这个意思。
    目前，大多数基层选举工作正在展开。因此现在最重要的事情是：各级特别是县级党政机关要加强领导，好好地总结和推广选举试点的好经验，充分发扬民主，防止和纠正任何敷衍潦草的现象，不仅要使选举工作按照全国人民代表大会常务委员会规定时间完成，而且要保证选举工作做得很好。
