    A Plea from Tianjin Carpet Pattern Artists
    Jin Xin
    For nearly two hundred years, the beautiful and vibrant carpets designed and created by Chinese folk artists specializing in carpet patterns have occupied a prominent position in the world market and have been praised by countries around the world. Today, Chinese carpets are still sold in dozens of countries across Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, and the Americas. Tianjin's export plan to capitalist countries alone for 1956 is 30% larger than the total for the two years of 1954 and 1955.

    Logically, the artistic level and living standards of these folk artists should have improved accordingly with the development of carpet production. But this is not the case. In Tianjin, the number of folk artists specializing in carpet patterns reached over seventy at its peak, and there were still seventeen or eighteen after liberation, but now there are only six left, and they are struggling to make a living.

    Since 1952, the Tianjin Foreign Trade Department has not designed any new patterns for exported carpets, but has only used old patterns such as dragons, phoenixes, Five Blessings and Longevity, and seasonal flowers and plants to solicit business from abroad. They have not been able to offer any new artistic designs for the world to admire.

    Because foreign clients need drawings for orders, they still need folk artists to draw them, but the prices are very low: a pattern that usually takes seven days to complete is only paid seven yuan and five jiao, half a drawing gets three yuan and seven jiao five fen, a quarter of a drawing gets a quarter of the price, and an eighth of a drawing gets another half off. What is most disheartening is that sometimes they spend all their energy and rack their brains, spending ten days or half a month designing and drawing a pattern, but it is not selected, which is equivalent to wasted labor. Under these circumstances, these folk artists have no choice but to rush to complete tasks in order to make a living: the less time spent on design, the better, and how can they care about the artistry of the patterns! These six artists have joined the public-private partnership of the advertising industry, and have made slight adjustments in the wage reform, but their treatment is still pitifully low. For example, Li Jingbian, an artist who has been drawing carpet patterns for nearly forty years, only earns eighty-four yuan, and Sun Zhaonian, the most artistically skilled designer, earns only fifty-eight yuan. The other artists have been designing patterns for more than eighteen years, and their wages are just as low. Because of heavy family burdens, they often have to sell their belongings or borrow money to survive. The artist Li Jingbian has debts of more than five hundred yuan. Some people work day and night to make a living and have already contracted lung disease and are recuperating. It is not difficult to understand why no young people have come to learn the art of carpet pattern design since liberation.

    Now we appeal: if we do not pay attention to this carpet pattern art, which has enjoyed extremely high and unique honor in various countries in the world in the past, then this artistic flower with a long history in the motherland is in danger of being destroyed. We hope that our relevant departments will pay attention to the inheritance and development of this art.

    天津地毯图案艺人的呼声
    晋新
    近二百多年来，由我国地毯图案民间艺人设计组成的美丽、鲜艳的地毯，一直在世界市场上占着显著的地位，一向为世界各国所称赞。现在，我国地毯仍行销于欧、亚、澳、非、美洲的数十个国家。仅天津1956年对资本主义国家输出的计划数字，就比1954和1955年两个年度的总和还大30％。
    按道理，这些民间艺人的艺术水平和生活待遇应该和地毯生产的发展同时得到相应的提高。但事实并非如此。在天津的地毯图案民间艺人，在极盛时代有七十多人，解放以后也有十七、八人，而现在只剩下六个人了，且维持生活很困难。
    天津市对外贸易部门自1952年以来，出口的地毯再没有设计出什么新的图案花样，只是用以前设计的龙、凤、五福团寿、四季花草等古老图案向国外承揽业务。拿不出什么新的艺术图案供世人欣赏。
    由于国外的订户需要订货的绘画图样，因此还要民间艺人画，但是价格压的很低：一般需要七天才能绘制成的图案只给七元五角钱，画一半给三元七角五，画四分之一给四分之一的价钱，画八分之一的就再打一个对折。最使人感到伤心的是，有时他们费尽心思，挖空脑汁，花了十天半月功夫设计绘出了一张图样，却选不上，就等于白白劳动了。在这种情况下，这些民间艺人为了生活问题，只好赶任务：设计的时间越省越好，哪里还管图案的艺术性呢！这六位艺人加入了广告业公私合营的队伍，在工资改革中做了少许调整，待遇却仍低得可怜，如一位画了将近四十年地毯图案的艺人李景忭工资才八十四元，设计艺术水平最高的孙兆年工资仅有五十八元，其他几位设计图案的历史都在十八年以上，工资一样很低。因为家庭的负担重，他们不得不经常以变卖或借债为生，艺人李景忭外债高过五百元。有的人为了生活，日夜赶活，已患肺病休养了。这就不难理解：解放以后为什么没有一位青年人再来学习地毯图案这一门艺术的原因所在。
    现在我们呼吁：如果我们再不重视这一门已往即在世界各国享有极高独特荣誉的地毯图案艺术，那么这一支在祖国有悠久历史的艺术花朵就有被断送的危险。希望我们的有关部门重视这门艺术的继承和发扬。
