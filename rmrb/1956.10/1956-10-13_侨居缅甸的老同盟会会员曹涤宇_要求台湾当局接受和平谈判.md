Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, 12th - According to reports in Yangon Chinese newspapers, Cao Di-yu, a 75-year-old Tongmenghui member residing in Burma, said on October 10th, while commemorating the 45th anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution: "As a member of the Tongmenghui, I am sincerely gratified by all the achievements of the motherland today." He said that there was only one thing he couldn't set his mind at ease about, and that was that China had not yet achieved complete unification, and Taiwan had not yet returned to the embrace of the motherland.

Cao Di-yu said: "If the Taiwan authorities can accept Premier Zhou's call for peace and unite to build the motherland and jointly resist foreign aggression, then Mr. Sun and the martyrs who participated in the revolution can also find comfort in heaven." Cao Di-yu suggested that the old Tongmenghui members and Kuomintang members living in Burma send a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan, asking him to accept peace talks so that the motherland can be unified at an early date.

Chen Yusheng, a former member of the Chinese Revolutionary Party who personally participated in the battle to overthrow Yuan Shikai, said: "Taiwan must return to the embrace of the motherland. The United States cannot gain a foothold in Taiwan." He believes that the peaceful liberation of Taiwan will further ease the international situation and be more conducive to world peace.

Chen Jueyan, former Standing Committee member and Secretary of the Kuomintang General Branch in Burma, said that it is best to liberate Taiwan peacefully, but Taiwan must get rid of the influence of the United States.

    侨居缅甸的老同盟会会员曹涤宇
    要求台湾当局接受和平谈判
    新华社仰光12日电　据仰光华侨报纸报道，侨居缅甸的七十五岁老同盟会会员曹涤宇在10月10日纪念辛亥革命四十五周年的时候发表谈话说：“作为一个同盟会会员，我对于今日祖国的一切成就感到衷心欣慰。”他说，只有一点未能放心，那就是中国还没有获得完全的统一，台湾还没有回到祖国的怀抱。
    曹涤宇说：“如果台湾当局能够接受周总理的和平号召，一致团结，建设祖国，共御外侮，则孙先生及参加革命的烈士们在天之灵也可以得到安慰。”曹涤宇建议旅缅的老同盟会员们和国民党员们致电台湾蒋介石，要他接受和平谈判，以便使祖国早日统一。
    亲身参加过打倒袁世凯战役的前中华革命党党员陈羽生说：“台湾一定要回到祖国怀抱。美国在台湾是站不住脚的。”他认为和平解放台湾将使国际局势更加缓和，对世界和平更加有利。
    前国民党驻缅甸总支部常务委员兼秘书陈觉彦说，用和平方式解放台湾是最好的，但是，台湾必须摆脱美国的势力。
