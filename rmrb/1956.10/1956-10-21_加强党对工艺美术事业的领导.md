    Strengthen the Party's Leadership over Arts and Crafts
    Deng Jie, Deputy Director of the Central Bureau of Handicraft Industry

    China's arts and crafts have a long history, are exquisitely beautiful, and rich and diverse, fully demonstrating the wisdom and creativity of the Chinese working people. Such as ivory carving, stone carving, wood carving, cloisonné, various jewelry gold and silver inlay, porcelain, lacquerware, carpets, lace, Xiang embroidery, Su embroidery and various weaving, etc., have long enjoyed a high reputation in the international community. However, before liberation, due to the invasion and destruction by imperialism and the ravages of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, it gradually declined; the talented folk artists were plunged into starvation, poverty, and displacement.

    After the nationwide liberation, the Party and the government attached great importance to the arts and crafts, and adopted measures such as supplying raw materials, processing orders, purchasing and sales, technical guidance, and low-interest loans to provide assistance and support. Through cooperativization, various forms of arts and crafts cooperatives (groups) were organized in various parts of the country, with more than 300,000 members. The production and lives of many veteran artists have been settled, some of the artists who changed careers in the past have returned to the team, and lost products have gradually resumed production. The political status of artists has also been improved, such as ivory carving artist Yang Shihui, jade carving veteran artist Liu Deying, and velvet silk paper flower veteran artist Jin Yulin were all elected as members of the Beijing Municipal Political Consultative Conference.

    In order to improve and promote arts and crafts, the Central Government established the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts and the Institute of Arts and Crafts Science. Some regions have also established arts and crafts research institutes, established arts and crafts exhibition halls, held arts and crafts exhibitions, organized artists to learn from each other and experience life among the masses, and helped design and create. The sales proportion of arts and crafts products in domestic and foreign markets has increased year by year. In the past few years, China's arts and crafts products have participated in 55 economic and cultural exchange exhibitions abroad, all of which have been well received internationally. In the technical cooperation between China and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, there are more than ten projects related to the export of arts and crafts technology, such as cloisonné, pottery, embroidery, lacquerware, small woodwork, handmade paper, velvet silk paper flowers and various weaving. Recently, at the International Handicraft Exhibition that opened in London, England, Chinese artist Gu Wenxia, a Su embroidery girl, and Lang Shaoan, a well-known "dough figurine man" from Beijing, were invited to go abroad. These all show that under the leadership of the Communist Party, in the process of socialist construction, China's arts and crafts have been valued by all parties, not only gradually restoring production, but also achieving new development.

    However, at present, China's arts and crafts industry cannot fully meet the needs of the ever-developing national economy and cultural and artistic undertakings; there are still some problems in the work that need to be solved quickly.

    From the central to the local level, specialized departments for arts and crafts have not yet been established, and the leadership work is weak and ineffective. Up to now, some industries have not been fully restored; some artists have not yet returned to the team, and the lives of some of the artists who have returned to the team have not been adequately guaranteed.

    The thinking of some people in the arts and crafts circles is quite chaotic. The idea of "no one is better than me, I am the only one" and the narrow view of not exchanging experiences still exist among some artists. Some people look down on Chinese things and think that everything foreign is good. Some people look down on current products and are obsessed with the past, thinking that the treasures of the Palace Museum are the best. Some people use raising standards as an excuse to detach themselves from reality and advocate building an "ivory tower." Some people look down on veteran artists, discriminate against them, and even despise them. Artists have rich practical experience and artistic skills, but in the creative process, they do not receive the artistic theory and design technology guidance from arts and crafts experts. Many excellent creative experiences cannot be scientifically summarized, and it is difficult to improve to a theoretical level. Some production units have repeatedly invited arts and crafts masters to give guidance in person, which is more difficult than inviting Zhuge Liang three times. The main reason for the above-mentioned chaotic thinking is that the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" has not been well implemented in the field of arts and crafts.

    At present, China's arts and crafts products are far from meeting the needs of domestic and foreign markets. For example, in the first half of this year, in addition to completing the delivery task of 50,000 velvet birds and velvet animals ordered by Czechoslovakia, the increased purchase task of 80,000 in the second half of the year can only produce 20,000. This year, Zhejiang golden silk straw hats need 1.08 million, but only 700,000 can be produced. The supply situation in the domestic market is also quite tight. Beijing's filigree brooches can only produce 20,000 dozens in the first quarter, but the actual need is 180,000 dozens; in addition to supplying exports, Jiangsu yellow grass products for domestic sales can only supply 50% of the needs of important cities such as Shanghai and Beijing. In the future, foreign markets will continue to expand and people's living standards will continue to improve. If the production of arts and crafts is not arranged as soon as possible, it will be in a very passive position.

    The raw materials for producing arts and crafts are diverse in variety and small in quantity, but the quality requirements are very high. Many domestically produced raw materials are not organized for production and supply by anyone, and the quality and quantity of imported raw materials cannot be fully guaranteed. Some high-quality products cannot open up domestic and foreign markets because the relevant departments are not actively promoting sales, and the variety of colors and varieties is gradually decreasing. The processing fees are low, the producers' income is meager, and their lives are difficult. For example, the wages of employees in the Suzhou Embroidery Cooperative are only 35 to 44 cents per day; Du Yunsong, an internationally renowned wood carver in Dongyang, Zhejiang, earns only 39 yuan per month; Xie Dakun, a famous bamboo curtain artist in Liangping, Sichuan, earns only 18 yuan per month; Gong Yuzhang, a veteran bamboo fan artist, earns only about 30 yuan per month; due to the low wages of artists in the Fuzhou Wood Carving Cooperative, 69 people have requested to withdraw from the cooperative and seek a living elsewhere. In particular, Chinese paintings with special national styles have not received due attention. The income of Chinese painters is too low, and their lives are difficult. Painting a sandalwood fan is only given two or three cents, which is lower than the income of small vendors selling cabbage by pushing a cart, which is extremely unreasonable.

    Therefore, I would like to make the following suggestions for strengthening the Party's leadership over the arts and crafts industry:

    (1) Establish specialized departments at the central and local levels to uniformly lead the arts and crafts industry, strengthen the leadership of Party committees at all levels over the arts and crafts industry, unify the leadership of arts and crafts enterprises and undertakings of various economic types, and implement hierarchical management; gradually incorporate the production, supply and sales plans of arts and crafts enterprises into the national plan in order to carry out comprehensive planning and develop production in a planned way.

    (2) Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, mobilize the strength of all relevant parties to vigorously support and develop the arts and crafts industry. It is hoped that the commercial departments will earnestly assist in solving problems related to raw material supply, product promotion, and low wages in the field of arts and crafts. It is hoped that the National Artists Association will provide practical assistance in art theory, creative design, and production technology.

    (3) Convene representative meetings or symposiums of veteran artists from all over the country and provinces and cities, strengthen the unity and education of veteran artists, encourage them to pass on their skills, and provide reasonable technical allowances; help them solve the difficulties in creating new products, organize them to visit or conduct overseas inspections, and broaden their horizons. In terms of political treatment, they should be given consideration. According to their artistic achievements, they should be given academic titles, and they should be absorbed into the Artists Association and organized to participate in necessary political activities to improve their thinking.

    (4) The central and provincial and municipal governments should actively establish and enrich arts and crafts research institutions and establish arts and crafts exhibition halls. Announce to the whole country, widely solicit talents, absorb a group of artists with special skills as experts, and hire a group of well-known people in society who have research on arts and crafts as consultants, in order to achieve the effect of mutual learning and grinding. Establish secondary arts and crafts training schools and training courses. In addition to educating existing apprentices to learn from veteran artists, recruit some junior high school students and above to learn arts and crafts; it is necessary to adopt the method of master teaching apprentices, which is both economical and realistic, and also effective quickly.

    In short, the task of China's arts and crafts in the future is very important. Don't let us, in our generation, ruin the countless good things handed down from our ancestors that are called national treasures. If we check in the future and find that "people are dead and art is extinct," it will be too late to regret it! We must organize and expand the production of handicrafts according to the needs of domestic and foreign markets. Treasure the labor achievements of our ancestors and systematically summarize the advanced experience of China's arts and crafts over thousands of years. Under the principle of preserving national characteristics, local styles, and reflecting real life, master advanced production technology, "bring forth the new through the old," and further strive for the improvement, improvement, and promotion of China's arts and crafts. The arts and crafts of the new era and new China have broad development prospects.

    加强党对工艺美术事业的领导
    中央手工业管理局副局长　邓洁
    我国的工艺美术有悠久历史，精致美观，丰富多采，充分表现出我国劳动人民的智慧和创造性。如象牙雕刻、石雕、木雕、景泰蓝、各种珠宝金银镶嵌、瓷器、漆器、地毯、花边、湘绣、苏绣及各种编织等等，早已在国际上享有很高的声誉。但在解放前由于遭受帝国主义的侵略破坏和国民党反动统治的摧残，日趋衰落；多才多艺的民间艺人，竟陷于饥寒交迫，流离失所的境地。
    全国解放后，党和政府对工艺美术事业非常重视，采取供应原料、加工订货、收购包销、技术指导、低利贷款等办法，予以协助支持。通过合作化在全国各地组织了各种形式的工艺美术合作社（组），社（组）员达三十万余人。很多老艺人的生产和生活都得到了安置，过去改业的艺人有些已经归了队，失传的产品，也逐步地恢复了生产。艺人们的政治地位也提高了，如象牙雕刻艺术家杨士惠、玉器雕刻老艺人刘德瀛、绒绢纸花老艺人金玉林等都当选为北京市政治协商委员会委员。
    中央为着提高和发扬工艺美术，筹办了中央工艺美术学院和工艺美术科学研究所。有些地区也成立了工艺美术研究所，设立了工艺美术陈列馆；举办了工艺美术展览会，组织艺人互相观摩并到群众中体验生活，帮助设计创作。工艺美术产品在国内外市场上的销售比重，逐年增加，几年来我国工艺美术品参加出国的经济文化交流展览会达五十五次，都得到国际好评。我国和苏联、人民民主国家技术合作中，有关工艺美术技术出口的，如景泰蓝、陶器、刺绣、漆器、小木作、手工造纸、绒绢纸花及各种编织等达十多个项目。最近在英国伦敦开幕的国际手工艺品展览会，我国艺人苏绣姑娘顾文霞和北京有名的“面人郎”——郎绍安应邀出国了。这些，都说明我国工艺美术在共产党领导下，在社会主义建设进程中，已经为各方面所重视，不仅逐步地恢复了生产，而且得到了新的发展。
    但是，目前我国工艺美术事业还不能完全适应国民经济及文化艺术事业日益发展的需要；工作中还存在着一些问题，需要迅速加以解决。
    从中央到地方都还没有建立工艺美术的专管部门，领导工作表现软弱无力。到目前为止，有些行业还没有完全恢复；有些艺人还没有归队，已归队的部分艺人的生活，还得不到应有的保证。
    一部分工艺美术界的思想是相当混乱的。“人不如我，唯我独尊”的思想，以及互不交流经验的狭隘观点还在一部分艺人中存在着。有的人看不起中国的东西，一切东西都以外国的为好。有的人看不起现在的产品，嗜古成癖，一切都以故宫博物馆的宝藏为妙。有的人借口提高，脱离现实，力主建筑“象牙之塔”。有的人看不起老艺人，歧视他们，甚至卑视他们。艺人们有丰富的实际经验和艺术技巧，在创作过程中，得不到工艺美术专家的艺术理论和设计技术的指导。许多优良的创作经验，不能加以科学的总结，很难提高到理论水平。有的生产单位多次邀请工艺美术家亲临指导，比三请诸葛还要困难。产生上述混乱思想的主要原因，是由于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针政策，在工艺美术方面还没有得到很好贯彻。
      目前，我国工艺美术产品，远远不能满足国内外市场的需要。例如，今年上半年除完成捷克斯洛伐克订购的五万只绒鸟绒兽的交货任务外，下半年八万只的增购任务，只能生产两万只。浙江金丝草帽今年需要一百零八万顶，只能生产七十万顶。国内市场的供应情况也相当紧张，北京市的花丝别针，一季度只能生产二万打，实际需要十八万打；江苏黄草织品除供应出口外，内销只能供应上海、北京等重要城市需要的百分之五十。今后国外市场不断扩大，国内人民生活日益提高，如果对工艺美术品的生产不能及早安排，将要处于非常被动的地位。
    生产工艺美术品的原料，品种繁多，数量虽然不大，但质量要求却很高。很多国产原料，无人负责组织生产和供应，国外进口原料，在质量上、数量上也得不到充分的保证。有些优质产品由于有关部门不积极试销，国内外市场打不开，花色品种，逐渐减少。工缴费偏低，生产者收入微薄，生活艰难。如苏州刺绣社社员工资每天三角五分到四角四分；在国际闻名的浙江东阳木雕刻家杜云松，每月收入仅三十九元；四川梁平竹帘名艺人谢大坤每月收入仅十八元；竹扇老艺人龚玉章每月收入也只有三十元左右；福州木刻社的艺人，由于工资收入低，有六十九个人要求退社到外地另谋生路。尤其是我国具有特殊的民族风格的国画没有得到应有的重视。国画家的收入过低，生活困难，画一把檀香扇子，只给两三毛钱，比推小车卖白菜的小商小贩的收入还低得多，这是极不合理的。
    为此，我对于加强党对工艺美术事业的领导，提出如下几点建议：
      （一）建立中央及地方统一领导工艺美术事业的专业部门，加强各级党委对工艺美术事业的领导，把各种经济类型的工艺美术企业和事业，统一领导起来，并实行分级管理；把工艺美术企业的供产销计划逐步纳入国家计划之内，以便进行全面规划，有计划地发展生产。
      （二）在各级党委的领导下，调动各有关方面的力量，大力支持和发展工艺美术事业。希望商业部门认真地协助解决有关工艺美术方面的原料供应、产品推销和工资偏低等问题。希望全国美术家协会在艺术理论、创作设计和生产技术上给予切实帮助。
      （三）召开全国和各省市的老艺人代表会或座谈会，加强对老艺人的团结和教育，鼓励他们传授技艺，给予合理的技术津贴；帮助他们解决创作新产品的困难，组织他们参观或出国考察，扩大眼界。在政治待遇上，应给予他们照顾。根据他们的艺术成就给予学术头衔，吸收他们参加美术家协会，组织他们参加必要的政治活动，提高他们的思想。
      （四）中央和各省市应积极兴办和充实工艺美术研究机构，设立工艺美术陈列馆。昭告全国，广罗人才，吸收一批有特殊技艺的艺人为专家，聘请一批社会上对工艺美术有研究的知名人士当顾问，以收互相观摩，砌磋琢磨之效。创办中等工艺美术传习所和训练班，除教育现有学徒向老艺人学习外，再招收一部分初中以上的学生，学习工艺美术；要采用老师傅带徒弟的办法，既经济、又现实，而且收效也快。
    总之，今后我国工艺美术的任务，是很重大的。千万不要在我们这一代，把无数称为国宝的祖传下来的好东西搞掉了，到将来检查“人亡艺绝”，那就悔之晚矣！我们必须根据国内外市场需要，组织和扩大工艺品的生产。珍贵祖国先辈的劳动成果，有步骤地有系统地总结几千年来我国工艺美术的先进经验。在保存民族特点、地方风格和反映现实生活的原则下，掌握高等制作技术，“推陈出新”更进而讲求我国工艺美术的改进、提高和发扬光大。新时代新中国的工艺美术是有广阔发展前途的。
