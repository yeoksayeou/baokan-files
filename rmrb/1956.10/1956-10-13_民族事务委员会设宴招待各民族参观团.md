Xinhua News Agency, 11th — The Nationalities Affairs Commission hosted a banquet tonight for fifteen nationalities visiting groups currently touring Beijing.

	Ulanhu, Vice Premier of the State Council and Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, said in his speech at the banquet that the unity of the motherland and the cooperation among all nationalities are now more consolidated and developed. The equal rights of all nationalities are guaranteed by the Constitution and the laws. The vast majority of areas and populations where minority nationalities live in concentrated communities have successively established, or are preparing to establish, national autonomous regions. The interests of the minority nationalities living in mixed or scattered communities have also been taken care of. The economic and cultural construction in minority areas has also made significant progress. All of these have brought about, and are bringing about, great changes in the outlook of minority areas in our country.

	Ulanhu said that there are still many shortcomings in the work concerning nationalities. He hoped that everyone would offer opinions on the shortcomings in the work of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, which is the state organ for nationalities work, so as to improve the work concerning nationalities, and to make the people of all nationalities more united and live a better life.

	Present at the banquet tonight were Wang Feng, Liu Chun, Sa Kongliao, and Yang Jingren, Vice Chairmen of the Nationalities Affairs Commission; Bao Erhan and Sangji Yexi, Vice Chairmen of the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress; and responsible persons from relevant units.
