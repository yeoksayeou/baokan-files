    Cultivating Students' Ability to Think Independently
    Since the beginning of the new academic year, educational departments and some schools have begun to take relatively effective measures to alleviate the excessive learning burden on students, improve teaching methods, and pay attention to cultivating students' ability to think and work independently. This is a welcome phenomenon in the education sector, but a complete resolution of the problem requires continued effort from everyone.
    In the past, many students, especially those in higher education, had too heavy a course load, leading to excessive stress in their studies and lives. Many students spent more than sixty hours a week studying, some reaching over seventy hours. Students were busy passively coping with their coursework all day, losing their Sundays and holidays. The school's daily schedule was mechanically rigid. Some middle schools established too many trivial learning and living rules, rigidly arranging what students should do and how they should do it. Some of these rules were unnecessary; one middle school even stipulated that students' pockets and bags should not contain "irrelevant" items, and female students with long hair should braid it and tie it with colorful ribbons, and so on. Many universities also stipulated indicators and regulations for students' studies, restricting students to a fixed "framework." Excessive social activities were also imposed on students. In this situation, the knowledge students learned could not be digested or consolidated, their mental state was very tense, they lacked the ability to think and work independently, and their physical health was seriously affected. How could students' interests and strengths, initiative and creativity be fully developed?
    Some people believe that the country urgently needs a large number of talents, and the excessive learning burden on students is unavoidable. Some others believe that reducing students' coursework will affect the improvement of education quality. They lack confidence and hesitate to alleviate the excessive learning burden on students and cultivate students' bold creativity and independent thinking. Therefore, some schools have not taken a positive attitude to improve this work. They did not see that the country needs schools to cultivate construction talents with certain knowledge, but it is not enough for students to only have knowledge from books; what is more important is to be good at applying the knowledge learned to practical work. Independent thinking and independent working ability are one of the valuable conditions that national construction talents should possess. An ancient Chinese saying goes, "Learning without thinking is useless," which means that students should think independently, otherwise what they have learned is of little use. Therefore, letting students free themselves from the excessive learning burden, delve into in-depth research, and think independently will not only not reduce the quality of education, but will further improve the quality of education.
    The excessive learning burden on students and the lack of independent thinking and independent working ability are caused by various reasons, such as the quantity and quality of teachers cannot meet the actual requirements, there is a certain degree of dogmatism and formalism in teaching methods, and the knowledge base of new students is poor. These problems arise in the development of school education, and we must gradually solve them. Some problems, such as the excessive amount of courses stipulated in the teaching plans and teaching syllabuses, too much, too high content, too many course categories and class hours, and various assignments that are both cumbersome and tight, should be immediately thought of to improve and solve.
    Learning from Soviet experience and closely integrating it with China's reality, creatively applying these experiences, is of great significance for improving China's education cause. In the past, great achievements have been made in teaching reform by learning from Soviet experience. However, the learning of some Soviet experience also resulted in dogmatism and formalism, mechanically transplanting it without closely combining it with China's reality. In response to this situation, in the process of learning from Soviet experience, education departments and schools should more closely integrate it with China's reality, and accumulate and summarize their own national experience, practically revise and flexibly implement the current teaching plans and teaching syllabuses, appropriately streamline course categories and reduce class hours, and reduce excessive extracurricular homework and classroom discussions. In addition to required courses, higher education can appropriately increase some elective courses to expand students' knowledge areas.
    The rapid development of the national construction cause requires our school education to cultivate construction talents with both moral integrity and talent and physical health. However, all-round development cannot be understood as balanced development, and students cannot be required to make equal progress in all subjects, and various activities are collectively unified. Forcing uniformity and not handling affairs according to the actual situation will inevitably lead to the opposite result. All-round development education is not contradictory to cultivating students' independent thinking ability and developing students' specialties, but is consistent. School education should pay attention to inspiring and cultivating students' conscious attitude and initiative towards learning, work, and life, and be good at guiding them to fully develop their specialties on the basis of all-round development, and cultivate students' spirit of bold creation and ability to think independently. In school education work, we must also change the working methods of launching mass movements and advocate a style of working that is practical and realistic, and according to the characteristics of the school.
    In the teaching of higher education, realizing a hundred schools of thought contend will inevitably have a good effect on improving and raising the quality of teaching, giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of teachers, and enlivening the thinking of students. In this way, it is even more necessary to cultivate students' ability to think independently and distinguish right from wrong in the teaching process, so that students can use the spirit of independent research and learn and accept various theories and viewpoints through independent thinking, and consolidate and improve their knowledge level.
    Letting students participate in some social activities is beneficial to cultivating students' working ability and the style of connecting with the masses. However, these social activities should not be too many. Party committees, education administrative departments, and other relevant parties should jointly pay attention to correcting the phenomenon of excessive social activities of students, so that students have sufficient time to read.
    To alleviate students' excessive learning burden does not mean that students' learning tasks will be easier from now on. It is still very necessary for students to conduct intensive study of their coursework. At present, some schools lack guidance for students' self-study and have not explained the basic spirit of "teaching students in accordance with their aptitude" to students, so that some students have not considered well what they should learn and how to learn, and even an undue slackening phenomenon has occurred. This is worthy of attention. The country and the people place great hope on future construction talents. Students should fully learn to master the ability of independent thinking and independent work under various favorable conditions, and strive to become useful construction talents for the country.
    In the new academic year, we hope to continue to see some new atmospheres.

### 培养学生独立思考能力

    培养学生独立思考能力
    在新学年开始以后，教育部门和一些学校已经着手采取比较有效的办法，解除学生学习负担过重的现象，并且改进教学方法，注意培养学生的独立思考和独立工作能力。这是教育界的一种可喜的现象，是值得欢迎的；但是要彻底解决问题还有待于大家继续努力。
    过去，许多学生，特别是高等学校的学生，课程负担太重，学习和生活过度紧张。不少学生每周学习时间在六十小时以上，有的达到七十多小时。学生们整天忙于被动地应付功课，失去了星期天和假日。学校里的作息制度机械刻板。有些中学制定了过多的繁琐的学习和生活规则，把学生要做的事情和怎样做法都作了硬性安排。这些规则中有些是很不必要的，有一个中学甚至规定，学生的口袋和书包里不许装“不相干”的物品，女生的长头发应梳成辫子，并且扎上彩色的带子，等等。许多高等学校对学生的学习也规定了指标、条例，把学生限制在一种固定的“框子”里。过多的社会活动也强加到学生的头上来。在这种情况下，学生们所学的知识消化不了，也不能巩固，精神状态十分紧张，缺乏独立思考和独立工作能力，身体健康也受到严重影响。学生的志趣和特长，积极性和创造性，又哪里能够得到充分的发挥呢？
    有些人认为，国家建设迫切需要大批人才，学生学习负担过重是不可避免的。也有一些人认为，减轻了学生的课业，就会影响教育质量的提高。他们在减轻学生过重的学习负担，培养学生大胆创造和独立思考方面，缺乏信心，迟疑不决。因此，有一部分学校还没有采取积极的态度改进这方面的工作。他们没有看到，国家需要学校培养出具有一定知识的建设人才，但是学生只是有书本上的知识还不够，更重要的是要善于把所学的知识运用到实际工作中去。独立思考和独立工作能力是国家建设人才应该具有的可贵的条件之一。我国古话说，“学而不思则罔”，也就是说要学生独立思考的意思，否则学了也没有什么用场。因此，让学生从过重的学习负担下解脱出来，深入钻研，独立思考，不仅不会降低教育质量，反而能够进一步提高教育质量。
    学生学习负担过重，缺乏独立思考和独立工作能力，是由多方面的原因造成的，如师资的数量和质量不能适应实际的要求，在教学方法上有不同程度的教条主义和形式主义，入学新生的知识基础差。这些问题，是在学校教育发展中产生的，我们必须逐步加以解决。也有些问题，如教学计划和教学大纲所规定的课程分量太重，内容偏多、偏高，课程门类和上课时数过多，各种作业又繁又紧，等等，应该立即想法着手改进，设法解决。
    学习苏联经验，并且密切地结合中国实际，创造性地运用这些经验，对于改进我国教育事业具有重要意义。过去学习苏联经验进行教学改革有很大成绩。但是，对于有些苏联经验的学习也发生了教条主义和形式主义的毛病，机械搬用，没有密切结合中国实际。针对这种情况，教育部门和学校在学习苏联经验的过程中，要更密切地结合中国实际，并且要积累和总结本国经验，切合实际地修改并且灵活执行现行的教学计划和教学大纲，适当地精简课程门类和减少上课时数，减少过重的课外作业和课堂讨论。高等教育在必修课以外，可以适当地增加一些选修课，用来扩大学生的知识领域。
    国家建设事业的迅速发展，要求我们的学校教育培养德才兼备、身体健康的建设人才。可是，全面发展并不能理解为平均发展，不能要求学生各门功课齐头并进，各种活动都是集体统一。强求一律，不按照实际情况办事，必然会招致相反的后果。全面发展的教育同培养学生的独立思考能力，发展学生的特长不是矛盾的，而是一致的。学校教育应该注意启发和培养学生对待学习、工作和生活的自觉态度和主动精神，善于引导他们在全面发展的基础上充分发挥自己的特长，培养学生大胆创造的精神和独立思考的能力。在学校教育工作中，还要改变发动群众运动的工作方法，提倡切切实实，按照学校特点来做工作的风气。
    在高等学校的教学中，实现百家争鸣，对于改进和提高教学质量，发挥教师们的积极性和创造性，活跃学生们的思想，必然会发生良好的作用。这样，就更需要在教学过程中培养学生学会独立思考、明辨是非的能力，使学生们用独立钻研的精神，经过独立思考来学习和接受各种学说和见解，巩固和提高自己的知识水平。
    让学生参加一些社会活动，对培养学生的工作能力和联系群众的作风，是有好处的。可是，这些社会活动不能过多。党委、教育行政部门及其它有关方面，要共同注意纠正学生社会活动过多的现象，让学生有充裕的时间读书。
    要解除学生过重的学习负担，并不是说学生的学习任务就此轻松了。学生对功课进行紧张的学习还是非常必要的。目前，有些学校对学生的自学缺乏指导，没有向学生们讲清“因才施教”的基本精神，因此使得部分学生没有很好地考虑自己应该学什么，怎样学，甚至发生了不应有的松懈现象。这是值得注意的。国家和人民对未来的建设人才寄予巨大的希望。学生们在各种有利条件下，要充分学会掌握独立思考和独立工作能力，努力使自己成为国家有用的建设人才。
    在新的学年中，我们希望能够继续看到一些新的气象。
