Xinhua News Agency, October 20th News: According to a United Press International dispatch from Cairo, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser said on October 19th that he is willing to personally meet with British Prime Minister Eden and French Prime Minister Mollet in Geneva if he believes that this could lead to a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue.

Nasser said in an interview with "Special Report" reporter Herman that the negotiations on the Suez Canal issue initiated by Egypt will begin in Geneva in the week starting October 26th, but the specific date has not yet been determined. He said that Egypt is prepared to put forward some suggestions on the issue of canal tolls at this meeting. He expressed his firm opposition to the proposal to only discuss matters with the "Suez Canal Users Association."

Nasser said: "I am willing to cooperate and negotiate with all users of the Suez Canal, not just these eighteen countries." He pointed out that if it is agreed to hold negotiations with the "Suez Canal Users Association," countries that do not belong to this association, such as Ceylon and India, would be excluded.

Nasser also pointed out that any act of paying transit duties to the "Suez Canal Users Association" will be regarded as a hostile act against Egypt.

Nasser reiterated Egypt's willingness to revise the 1888 Convention to ensure freedom of navigation in the canal, and is willing to negotiate with the user countries on the maximum limit of transit duties.

Xinhua News Agency, October 20th News: New York News: Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi said at New York Airport on the 19th, before returning to his country, that Egypt will do its best to strive for the success of negotiations on the Suez issue. He said: "The Egyptian government will take all possible actions and perhaps impossible actions—if it can—to make further negotiations successful."

Fawzi once again refuted Lloyd's claim that Egypt had not proposed a solution to the Suez issue. Fawzi said: "We have provided a very broad basis for negotiations, which is very suitable for starting further negotiations." He also said: "After people sit down to talk, it is possible to elaborate and clarify any issues."

Fawzi hoped that the debate on the Suez issue in the United Nations Security Council would help "reveal the actual situation of the issue." He also stated that, in general, he agreed with the six principles for resolving the Suez issue, but the "wording and actual meaning" of the section on the so-called isolation of the canal from politics has become a "source of various conflicting interpretations" of this principle, thereby "not only failing to isolate the issue from politics, but instead rudely throwing the issue into the politics of not one country but many countries." He reiterated that the best way to isolate the canal from politics is to sign a sound convention.

When someone asked whether the "Suez Canal Users Association" could play a significant role in resolving the Suez issue, Fawzi asked unhappily: "By what qualification?"

Fawzi will return to Cairo via Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

    纳赛尔表示愿意同艾登和摩勒会谈
    并准备同运河所有使用国协商通行费问题
    法齐说埃及决心争取进一步谈判获得成功
    新华社20日讯　据合众社开罗消息，埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔在10月19日说，他愿意同英国首相艾登和法国总理摩勒在日内瓦亲自举行会谈，如果他认为这样能够导致苏伊士运河问题的和平解决的话。
    纳赛尔在接见“特写报”记者赫尔曼的时候说，埃及发起的关于苏伊士运河问题的谈判将在10月26日开始的那个星期内在日内瓦举行，但是具体日期还没有确定。他说，埃及准备在这个会议上提出某些关于运河通行费问题的建议。他表示坚决反对只同“运河使用国协会”进行讨论的主张。
    纳赛尔说：“我愿意同苏伊士运河所有的使用国而不只是同这十八个国家进行合作和举行谈判”。他指出，如果同意同“运河使用国协会”举行谈判，就会把不属于这个协会的国家像锡兰和印度等排除在外。
    纳赛尔还指出，任何向“运河使用国协会”缴纳通行税的行为都将被认为是对埃及的敌对行动。
    纳赛尔重申埃及愿意修改1888年公约以保证运河通航自由，并且愿意同各使用国就通行税的最高限额问题进行协商。
    新华社20日讯　纽约消息：埃及外交部长法齐在19日返国前在纽约机场表示，埃及将尽最大的力量来争取关于苏伊士问题的谈判获得成功。他说：“埃及政府将采取一切可能的行动和也许是不可能的行动——如果它能够这样——以使进一步的谈判成功。”
    法齐再一次驳斥了劳埃德提到的埃及没有提出解决苏伊士问题办法的说法。法齐说：“我们已经为谈判提供了非常广阔的基础，非常适宜于开始进一步的谈判。”他还说：“在人们坐下来会谈以后，详述和澄清任何问题都是可能的。”
    法齐希望联合国安全理事会就苏伊士问题进行的辩论有助于“揭露问题的实际情况”。他还表示，一般说来，他同意解决苏伊士问题的六项原则，但是，关于所谓运河应该同政治隔绝这一节的“措词和实际含义”却成为对这个原则的“各种相反的解释的来源”，从而“非但没有使这个问题同政治隔绝，反而把问题粗暴地投入不是一国而是许多国家的政治里”。他重申，使运河同政治隔绝的最好的办法就是签订一个完善的公约。
    有人问，“运河使用国协会”能不能在解决苏伊士问题中占相当重要的地位时，法齐不高兴地反问道：“凭什么资格？”
    法齐要转道荷兰阿姆斯特丹返回开罗。
