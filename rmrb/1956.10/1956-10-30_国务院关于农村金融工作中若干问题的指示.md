    Instructions of the State Council on Several Issues in Rural Financial Work
    Currently, the autumn harvest is largely complete, and agricultural cooperatives and farmers are selling agricultural and sideline products in large quantities. In order to coordinate the centralized purchase of agricultural and sideline products and avoid excessive currency circulation in the market, agricultural loans that have matured should be recovered on schedule, rural deposits should be actively absorbed, and the credit strength of banks and credit cooperatives should be increased during this season when farmers have money. In the first half of this year, the state prepaid agricultural and sideline products such as grain and cotton to agricultural cooperatives and farmers. These prepayments should be cleared and settled in conjunction with the autumn purchases. However, according to recent materials, many places lack sufficient understanding of the significance of recovering agricultural loans. The amount of agricultural loans planned to be recovered by these places this year only accounts for 30% to 40% of the total amount of agricultural loans due; many places do not pay attention to the work of absorbing deposits in rural areas and lack active preparation and deployment; some places even fail to clear prepaid deposits during the purchase of agricultural and sideline products, and still pay the full price repeatedly. On the other hand, these places have unrealistic ideas about the state's agricultural loan issuance next year, and require a much larger increase in agricultural loan quotas next year. That is to say: on the one hand, they do not try their best to recover what should be recovered; on the other hand, they demand that the state invest large amounts. This is a problem in current rural financial work that should be taken seriously.
    The state's agricultural loan quota for 1956 is 2.6 billion yuan. Adding the portion issued previously that has not yet been recovered, the total amount of agricultural loans issued by the state in rural areas will reach 3.6 billion yuan. This is a very large figure, and these loans have played a huge role in supporting agricultural cooperativization and developing agricultural production. However, it should be pointed out that such a huge increase in the issuance amount is not possible every year from the state's financial and material resources, nor is it necessary from the perspective of agricultural cooperatives and farmers' production. Many comrades place their hopes for increasing loans in 1957 entirely on the state's new agricultural loan quota, believing that the state will add a large agricultural loan issuance figure in 1957. However, according to the recent preliminary balance calculation for national finance and cash, if the state adds a large loan issuance on the basis of existing loans in 1957, it will inappropriately affect industrial construction and other investments, causing tension in finance, credit, and commodity supply. Therefore, the idea of ​​a large increase in agricultural loans next year is obviously unrealistic. The increase in agricultural loans in 1957, in addition to the small amount that the state can increase, should first and foremost rely on the recovery of original agricultural loans that have matured. The more original agricultural loans that are recovered, the greater the amount that can be increased for loan issuance. This must be made clear to cadres at all levels, agricultural cooperatives, and the masses of farmers. According to calculations, a total of 1.3 billion yuan of new and old agricultural loans have matured this year. If the work is done well, most of them can be recovered and converted into agricultural loan funds for next year. Some comrades also have the idea that the method of postponing the repayment of agricultural loans can be used to ensure that more than 90% of agricultural cooperative members increase their income. This idea is also wrong. For long-term loans such as agricultural capital construction investment and poor farmers' cooperative funds that cannot be profitable in the short term, the state has stipulated that they should be repaid in installments over two or three years; short-term loans such as production expenses and living loans should be repaid on schedule after the agricultural harvest. The way to ensure that agricultural cooperative members increase their income must be to rely on increasing production, developing diversified operations, relying on saving expenses, and correctly handling the relationship between internal accumulation and distribution within the cooperative. Postponing agricultural loans that should be repaid is not the same as truly increasing income, but merely misappropriating the state's cash and increasing the liabilities of agricultural cooperatives. If agricultural cooperatives have the ability to repay but postpone repayment, it is also detrimental to the agricultural cooperatives. Of course, the matured agricultural loans in disaster areas should be reduced or deferred according to the severity of the disaster; individual cases where repayment is indeed difficult due to special circumstances can also be reduced or deferred according to the repayment ability. It is wrong to mechanically force recovery without taking this situation into account. However, in general areas, without special circumstances, the principle of borrowing and repaying on schedule should be adhered to, and there is no reason to ask for less or deferred repayment.
    After this year's autumn harvest, the conditions for developing savings and attracting deposits in rural areas are extremely favorable. Although some areas suffered disasters this year, the harvest in general areas is good, and agricultural production has increased. After agricultural cooperativization, the agricultural production units are concentrated. After each agricultural cooperative sells agricultural and sideline products, it must retain some necessary public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and production expenses, which will not be used until the spring of next year, as well as the cash distributed to members. As long as we strengthen publicity and explanation, improve our work, and make agricultural cooperative cadres and members understand that depositing temporarily unused funds into banks and credit cooperatives can increase the state's credit strength and provide themselves with certain interest income; make agricultural cooperatives and members deposit voluntarily and withdraw conveniently, rural deposits can be greatly increased. In July of this year, the State Council issued instructions to correct the phenomenon of coercion and command in the work of banks and credit cooperatives in some areas in attracting deposits and expanding share capital. These instructions have achieved the desired results. The method of coercion and command can only make the work worse, not better, at any time. However, not using coercion and command does not mean that we can fail to actively and deeply carry out our work, and passively wait and let things take their course.
    This year, the state paid more than 1 billion yuan in deposits for the pre-purchase of agricultural and sideline products. The implementation of the agricultural product pre-purchase system can promptly solve the funds needed for agricultural production, reduce the centralized investment of agricultural product purchase funds, and further integrate agricultural production with the national plan. This system will be gradually promoted in the future, but it is necessary to truly maintain the credit of the pre-purchase system, promptly clear the accounts, and avoid delays and confusion without special circumstances.
    The State Council requires all localities to re-examine the recovery plan of matured agricultural loans based on the above principles, revise it according to the actual situation, and earnestly implement it. It is required to seize the opportunity of the peak season, strengthen publicity, actively carry out rural deposit savings work while adhering to the principle of voluntary deposits. It is required that state purchasing agencies promptly clear and settle prepaid deposits when purchasing agricultural and sideline products. It is required that all localities strengthen their leadership over rural financial work, treat this work as an important task, and arrange it together with the arrangement of agricultural product purchases and market arrangements, and pay attention to inspections at any time to ensure the needs of this year's peak season purchase funds and prepare for next year's agricultural loan funds.

### 国务院关于农村金融工作中若干问题的指示

    国务院关于农村金融工作中若干问题的指示
    目前秋收已经大体结束，农业社和农民正在大量卖出农副产品。为了配合集中的农副产品收购，避免市场的货币流通量过多，在这个农民有钱的季节，应当按期收回已经到期的农业贷款，积极地吸收农村存款，增加银行和信用社的信贷力量。今年上半年，国家向农业社和农民预购了粮食、棉花等农副产品，在秋后收购的时候，应当结合已经预付的定金，进行清理结算。但是根据最近收到的材料，不少地方对于收回农业贷款的意义认识不足，这些地方计划在本年内收回的农业贷款数字，只占到期应当收回的农业贷款总数的百分之三十到四十；不少地方对于在农村吸收存款的工作不加重视，缺乏积极的准备和部署；甚至有些地方在农副产品的收购当中，对于已经预付了的定金不作清理，仍然重复地付给全部价款。而在另一方面，这些地方对于明年国家农业贷款的发放，却存在着不切合实际的想法，要求明年的农业贷款指标还要增加很多。这就是：一方面应当收的不去尽可能努力去收；另一方面又要求国家大量投放。这是当前农村金融工作当中应当引起严重注意的问题。
    1956年国家发放农业贷款的指标为二十六亿元，加上以前发放还未收回的部分，国家在农村发放的农业贷款总数将达三十六亿元。这是一个很大的数字，这些贷款在支持农业合作化、发展农业生产上的作用是巨大的。但是应当指出，新增加这样巨大的发放数字，从国家的财力和物力来说不是年年可能的，从农业社和农民的生产来说也并不是需要的。许多同志把1957年增加贷款的希望，完全寄托在国家新增加农贷指标上，认为1957年国家还将要增加一个很大的农贷发放数字。但是根据最近对于国家财政和现金的初步平衡试算，如果1957年在现有贷款的基础上国家再增加很大的贷放，就要不适当地影响工业建设和其他方面的投资，引起财政、信贷和商品供应的紧张。因此明年大量增加农贷的想法，显然是不现实的。1957年农业贷款的增加，除了国家可以增加的少量指标以外，首先应当指望的，就是原有到期农贷的收回。原有到期农贷收回得越多，可以增加贷放的数字就越大，这一点必须向各级干部、农业社和农民群众讲清楚。根据计算，今年已经到期的新旧农贷共有十三亿元，工作作得好，大部分可以收回转作明年的农贷资金。有些同志还有这样一种想法，认为可以用推迟归还农贷的办法，保证农业社百分之九十以上的社员增加收入。这种想法也是错误的。农业基本建设投资和贫农合作基金等长期贷款，短期不能获利的，国家已经规定在两年或者三年以后分年偿还；生产费用和生活贷款等短期的贷款，应当在农业收获以后按期归还。保证农业社员增加收入的办法，必须是依靠增加生产，开展多种经营，依靠节约支出和正确地处理社内积累同分配的关系。推迟应当归还的农贷，并不等于真正增加收入，而仅仅是挪用了国家的现金，增加了农业社的负债。农业社有能力归还，推迟不还，对农业社来说也是不利的。当然，灾区的到期农贷，应当根据受灾的情况少收或者缓收；个别因为特殊情况偿还确有困难的，也可以根据偿还能力少收或者缓收。不照顾这种情况，机械地强迫收回是错误的。但一般地区，没有特殊情况，应当坚持有借有还按期归还的原则，没有理由也要求少收或者缓收。
    今年秋收以后，在农村开展储蓄吸收存款的条件是极为有利的。今年虽然部分地区遭受了灾害，但一般地区的年景是好的，农业是增产的。农业合作化以后，农业的生产单位集中了，每个农业社卖出了农副产品以后，都要保留若干必要的公积金、公益金和生产费用，到明年开春以后才陆续使用，还有社员分到的现金。只要加强宣传解释，改进工作，使农业社干部和社员懂得，把暂时不用的资金存入银行和信用社，就可以增加国家的信贷力量，自己也有一定的利息收入；使农业社和社员存款自愿，提取方便，就可以大大地增加农村存款。本年7月国务院发布了纠正若干地区银行、信用社在吸收存款扩大股金工作中强迫命令现象的指示，这个指示收到了应有的效果。用强迫命令的方法，在任何时候只能把工作作坏，不能把工作作好。但是不要强迫命令，并不是说可以不去积极地深入地进行工作，可以消极等待，放任自流。
    今年国家预购农副产品支付的定金共有十亿元以上。实行农产品预购制度，可以及时解决农业生产所需要的资金，可以减少农产品收购资金的集中投放，并且可以进一步把农业生产同国家计划结合起来，这个制度今后还要逐步推行，但是必须确实维护预购制度的信用，及时进行清理，没有特殊情况，不要拖延不清，造成混乱。
    国务院要求各地根据上述原则，重新审查到期农贷收回计划，按照实际情况加以修订，认真执行。要求抓紧旺季时机，加强宣传，在坚持存款自愿的原则下，积极开展农村存款储蓄工作。要求国家采购机关在收购农副产品的时候，及时地将预购定金加以清理结算。要求各地加强对农村金融工作的领导，把这个工作当作一个重要工作，在安排农产品收购、安排市场的同时，一并加以安排，随时注意检查，以保证今年旺季收购资金的需要，并为明年农业贷款资金作好准备。
