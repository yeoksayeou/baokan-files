Mr. Mayor, Your Excellencies, Friends:

In the short few days we have spent here, we have been deeply moved by the warm and spontaneous welcome we have received from all sides. I thank you, Mr. Mayor, for giving me this opportunity to express my gratitude to the enthusiastic and friendly people of this city at this mass meeting.

As we walked through the streets of Beijing, what impressed us most was the historical atmosphere that permeates this beautiful and elegant city. Everywhere there are monuments, buildings, and gardens that record the glorious past of this country and mark the great contributions of recent times. Indeed, in a sense, this ancient city is a living symbol of China; every street, every monument, and every garden evokes memories of a page in history. At the same time, one can also feel a new vitality, a climax of activity moving toward the future. Modern buildings, office buildings, apartments, colleges, hotels, and the various new construction projects underway everywhere are proof of this progress. But even more impressive is the discipline, energy, confidence, and determination you have shown in the work of building your motherland. Seeing all this leaves me with no doubt that you have a great future and that you have the strength to realize it.

I can say that in Pakistan, we also have the same problems of construction and development. We have also inherited many difficulties and have arduous tasks ahead of us. The founding of Pakistan is the result of the determination of nearly 100 million people to control their own destiny. We need our own motherland in order to live according to our own ideas and traditions, to express our own hopes, and to realize our aspirations. In the political arena, we have recently adopted a constitution based on the will of the people, thereby laying the foundation for our ideals. At the founding ceremony of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, we were honored to have the esteemed Chinese representative, Vice Premier He Long, with us; we are very pleased that His Excellency He Long represented the Chinese people in our celebration.

We face many problems: in our work to improve the well-being of the people, we still have long and arduous efforts to make. As you all know, Pakistan was born in 1947. One of the most serious and difficult problems we encountered at the beginning was the problem of millions of refugees. We not only had to solve their food and housing problems, but also finding them familiar occupations was also urgent. At the same time, the economy we inherited was unstable and backward, so we needed to start from scratch in almost every aspect. In the face of these many difficulties, we have reason to be satisfied with the achievements we have made in the short nine years since independence, but the work to be done in the future is still arduous. In the new constitution, we have stipulated the implementation of mass education, making primary education free and compulsory; to improve the conditions of workers; and to fairly distribute wealth to prevent wealth from being concentrated in the hands of a few. In agriculture and crafts, we are trying to adopt new scientific methods and technologies to increase agricultural and industrial production. We want to ensure the basic necessities of life for the people, providing them with sufficient clothing, shelter, education, medical care, and employment opportunities. In these areas, we have a lot in common with China, and I am very pleased to see that China has made such rapid and great progress. Therefore, I am fully convinced that the Chinese people can easily understand the problems facing Pakistan.

In the world, the era of solving disputes through war is over. We firmly believe that as long as the parties concerned have the necessary goodwill and sincerity, no dispute cannot be resolved peacefully through universally recognized consultation, reconciliation, mediation, or arbitration.

My friends, for us, peace is not just a word of hope, but an essential need, because the progress and happiness of our people can only be realized and maintained in a peaceful environment. Our foreign policy is based on this principle, and it is on this basis that we extend the hand of friendship and cooperation to all countries in the world, especially our neighbors!

Before I conclude my remarks, let me express my sincere hope that there will be more contacts and exchanges between our two countries.

I extend my most sincere congratulations to you, to the Chinese people, and to your great country. Congratulations on your outstanding achievements, and I hope and believe that you will have an even brighter future.

### 苏拉瓦底总理的讲话

专栏：

    苏拉瓦底总理的讲话市长先生，阁下，诸位朋友：
    在这里度过的短短几天里，我们从各方面得到了热烈的和自发的欢迎，使我们十分感动；我感谢您，市长先生，给我这个群众大会的机会向这个城市的热情和友好的人民表达我的谢意。
    在走过北京的街道时，使我们印象最深刻的，是那充满这个美丽和优雅的城市的历史气氛。到处都是记载了这个国家的光辉的过去以及标志着晚近的伟大贡献的古迹、建筑物和花园。真的，从某种意义来说，这个古老的城市是中国的一个活生生的象征；每一条街道，每一个古迹和花园都引起对历史的某一页的回忆。同时人们也可以感觉到一种新的活力，一个朝着将来前进的活动的高潮。现代的建筑物、办公大楼、公寓、学院、旅馆以及在到处进行着的各种新的建筑工程，就是这种进展的证明。但是令人印象更为深刻的，就是你们在进行建设祖国的工作中所表现的纪律性、精力、信心和决心。看到了这一切，使我丝毫不怀疑，你们有着伟大的前途而且你们有力量使它实现。
    我可以这样说：在巴基斯坦，我们也有着同样的建设和发展的问题。我们同样继承了许多难题，而且面前有着艰巨的任务要完成。巴基斯坦的建国，就是近一亿人民决心要掌握自己的命运的结果。我们需要有自己的祖国，以便按照我们自己的观念和传统去生活，去表达我们自己的希望和努力实现我们的愿望。在政治方面，最近我们通过了一个基于人民的意志的宪法，从而为我们的理想打下了基础。在巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国的成立典礼上，我们曾经荣幸地有尊敬的中国代表国务院副总理贺龙元帅同我们在一起；我们很高兴，贺龙元帅阁下代表中国人民参加了我们的喜庆。
    我们面对着许多问题：在我们增进人民幸福的工作中，还要作长久和艰苦的努力。你们都知道，巴基斯坦是在1947年诞生的。我们首先碰到的一个很严重和困难的问题，那就是几百万难民的问题。我们不仅要解决他们的食宿问题，而且替他们找到习惯的职业这个问题也很迫切。同时我们所继承的经济是不稳定的和落后的，因此我们在各个方面几乎都需要从头做起。在这许多困难面前，我们有理由对我们在独立后的短短九年间所取得的成就感到满意，但是今后要做的工作还是艰巨的。我们在新宪法中规定了要实施群众性的教育，使初级教育成为免费的义务教育；要改善工人的状况：要公平地分配财富，防止财富集中在少数人手里。在农业和工艺方面，我们正在设法采用新的科学方法和技术以便增加农业和工业的生产。我们要想做到保证人民的基本生活必需品，供给他们足够的衣着、住所、教育、医疗和就业的条件。在这些方面，我们同中国有着很多的共同点，而我很高兴地看到：中国已经取得这么迅速和巨大的进展。因此，我完全相信，中国人民很容易理解巴基斯坦所面临的问题的。
    在世界上，可以用战争来解决争端的时代已经过去了。我们坚决相信：只要有关各方具有必要的善意和诚意，没有任何争端是不能够用公认的协商、和解、调解或仲裁等和平方式加以解决的。
    我的朋友们，对于我们来说，和平不仅仅是一个希望的字眼，而且是一种必不可少的需要，因为我们的人民的进步和幸福只有在和平的环境里才能够实现和加以保持。我们的外交政策就是基于这个原则，我们就是在这个基础上向世界上所有的国家，特别是我们的邻国伸出友谊和合作之手！
    在结束我的话以前，让我表示热烈希望我们两国之间将有更多的接触和交往。
    我向诸位，向中国人民和向你们伟大的国家表示最诚恳的祝贺。庆贺你们的卓越的成就，并且希望和相信你们将有一个更光辉的将来。
