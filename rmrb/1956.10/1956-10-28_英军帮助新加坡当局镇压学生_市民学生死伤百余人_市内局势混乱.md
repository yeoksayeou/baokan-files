Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, 27th: Singapore police made a sudden raid on some trade union organizations in Singapore this morning, carrying out arrests. The police used tear gas and opened fire.

According to a spokesman for the Singapore government, more than 400 people have been detained for questioning, including People's Action Party leader and Legislative Assembly member Lim Chin Siong.

This is the latest violent action taken by the Singapore authorities against students, workers and citizens of Singapore in the past two days. When armed police evicted striking students and sympathetic citizens who had gathered in and around two schools on October 26, they also opened fire and used tear gas, causing casualties.

According to an official Singapore announcement early on the 27th, eleven people had been shot dead by the military police, and ninety-nine were injured. The situation in Singapore is chaotic.

In the suppression operation on the 26th, the Singapore authorities used fully armed British troops. British Royal Air Force aircraft dropped large amounts of tear gas on the crowds. British troops equipped with armored vehicles set up obstacles in the city. A large number of police from the Federation of Malaya have been transferred to Singapore. A government spokesman announced that more British troops would arrive in Singapore from Malaya on the 27th.

Singaporean students went on strike to protest the Singapore authorities' dissolution of the Singapore Chinese Middle School Students' Union, the arrest of union staff, and the forced expulsion of students from schools. Their actions received widespread sympathy. On the same day that the Singapore authorities used force to suppress the striking students, other schools went on strike to protest, and workers in many businesses and shops held sympathy strikes. A strike by bus company workers paralyzed the city's only public transportation system.

Lee Kuan Yew, secretary of the Singapore People's Action Party, issued a statement on October 26 condemning the government's measures and demanding the government's resignation. He pointed out: "This serious crisis was caused by the mishandling of the Labor Front coalition government."

    英军帮助新加坡当局镇压学生
    市民学生死伤百余人　市内局势混乱
    据新华社27日讯　新加坡消息：新加坡武装警察在今天清早突然袭击新加坡的一些工会组织，进行搜捕。警察使用了催泪弹，并且开枪射击。
    据新加坡政府的一位发言人说，有四百多人已经被扣留起来以进行讯问，其中包括人民行动党领袖、立法议会议员林清祥在内。
    这是新加坡当局两天来对于新加坡学生、工人和市民们所采取的又一次暴力行动。当10月26日武装警察驱逐聚集在两所学校和学校附近地区的罢课学生和同情他们的市民群众时，他们也曾经开枪射击，并且使用催泪弹，造成了伤亡。
    据新加坡官方27日清早宣布，已经有十一人被军警击毙，有九十九人受伤。新加坡市内局势混乱。
    在26日的镇压行动中，新加坡当局使用了全副武装的英国军队。英国皇家空军的飞机向群众大量投掷催泪弹。配备装甲车的英国军队在市内设置了障碍物。大批马来亚联合邦的警察已经被调到新加坡。政府发言人宣布，将有更多的英国军队在27日从马来亚来到新加坡。
    新加坡学生罢课，是为了抗议新加坡当局解散新加坡中学生联合会，逮捕中学生联合会工作人员并且强迫学校开除学生。他们的行动得到广泛的同情。在新加坡当局用武力镇压罢课学生的当天，有其他学校停课表示抗议，许多企业和商店的工人举行了同情罢工。公共汽车公司工人的罢工使新加坡全市唯一的公共交通系统陷于瘫痪。
    新加坡人民行动党书记李光耀在10月26日发表声明，谴责政府的措施，并且要求政府辞职。他指出：“这个严重危机是由于劳工阵线联合政府处理不当而引起的。”
