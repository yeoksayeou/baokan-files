Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 21st. This year, the first year after agricultural cooperativization was realized, the mountainous areas of the Dongxiang Autonomous County, the most arid in Gansu Province, have achieved great success in soil and water conservation. More than 210,000 mu of mountain slopes have been cultivated with contour ridges, more than 23,000 mu of new terraced fields have been built, and many earth dams and gully dikes have been constructed. Additionally, 38.8 million trees have been planted on the mountain slopes. In total, the county completed the control of soil erosion over an area of more than 230 square kilometers this year, which is more than three times the total area controlled from 1953 to 1955.

	In this mountainous area during the late autumn season, newly built terraced fields, lush forests, and hillsides covered with grass can be seen everywhere. The Dongxiang Autonomous County is surrounded by the Yellow River and its tributaries, the Tao River and the Daxia River, and the entire county is a hilly gully area with undulating mountains. As a result of large-scale soil and water conservation efforts after cooperativization, many townships have become areas where "water does not leave the fields, soil does not go down the slopes, and mud does not leave the gullies." The crop yield in farmland that has undergone soil and water conservation has increased significantly. According to a typical survey of one township and one agricultural cooperative, the average yield per mu of summer and autumn fields this year increased by about 50% to 60% compared to farmland without soil and water conservation.

    甘肃省最干旱的东乡族自治县
    水土保持工作成就巨大
    新华社兰州21日电　甘肃省最干旱的东乡族自治县的山区，在今年实现农业合作化后的第一年，水土保持工作取得了巨大成就。有二十一万多亩山坡地培了地埂，新修梯田两万三千多亩，修筑了许多土坝、谷坊，山坡上还植了三千八百八十多万株树。共计今年全县完成的控制水土流失面积达二百三十多平方公里，等于1953年到1955年控制水土流失面积总和的三倍多。
    深秋时节，在这个山区里，到处可以见到新修的层层梯田，枝叶繁茂的片片树林和长满山坡的丛草。东乡族自治县的周围有黄河及其支流洮河和大夏河，全县是一个群山起伏的丘陵沟壑区。由于合作化后大规模开展水土保持的结果，许多乡已经成为“水不出田，土不下坡，泥不出沟”的地区。经过水土保持地区的农田产量显著提高，据一个乡和一个农业社的典型调查，今年夏田和秋田的每亩平均产量比没有进行水土保持的农田增产50％到60％左右。
