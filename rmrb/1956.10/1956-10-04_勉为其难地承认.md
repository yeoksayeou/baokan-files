    The Rosenbergs have been dead in the electric chair for three years, and Sobell, accused as an "accomplice," is still suffering in unjust imprisonment.
    However, the Rosenberg case is not over, and Sobell has not yielded. The denunciation of fascist atrocities and the struggle to defend justice for the Rosenbergs and Sobell are in full swing.
    Recently, the U.S. House Un-American Activities Committee published a 137-page "report" that viciously attacked the "National Committee to Secure Justice for the Rosenbergs and Sobell." However, the "report" revealed that this fascist-like organization was terrified by the fact that the committee's just activities were receiving increasing support. It said, "It must be reluctantly admitted that this subversion is widespread and persistent."
    The "report" easily labeled most of those participating in the "National Committee's" struggle for justice as "pro-communist," just as the Un-American Activities Committee easily puts any ordinary American who dares to defend their personality and democratic freedoms on a blacklist and persecutes them. However, what makes the Un-American Activities Committee feel difficult is that there are also people participating in this struggle for justice whom it cannot arbitrarily accuse: there are "well-meaning and unconcerned people," people responding to "humanitarian calls," "religious leaders," the famous atomic scientist Dr. Urey, and the late great scientist Dr. Einstein.
    The support of Dr. Urey and Dr. Einstein particularly annoyed the fascist persecutors. Therefore, the "report" also slandered them, saying that Urey was "standing on the side of these atomic spies" and made "the most misleading propaganda." Urey's statement exposed the purely fictitious nature of the so-called "atomic espionage case," and his views on the Rosenberg case were also supported by Einstein. The "report's" attempt to denounce the eloquent integrity of these two scientists as "propaganda" is futile.
    Fascist terror will not deter the struggle calling for Sobell's release. Morton Sobell's mother—a typical kind and gentle American mother in her sixties—recently traveled from the Americas to Europe to appeal for justice for her son. She said, "Thousands of enthusiastic friends surround us, not only helping us to visit Morton but even helping us travel across the country and around the world to appeal for justice for Morton and fight for Morton." Sobell's mother's appeal received widespread sympathy and support.
    What infuriates the terror-mongering maniacs of the Un-American Activities Committee is that, in the face of their terror, people have not retreated but have instead raised an unconquerable force, the name of which is justice, a strong will to defend the basic rights of democratic freedom.
    A "report" from an organization of the U.S. Congress has become a confession of guilt, a scathing self-mockery of American-style "democracy" and "freedom." (Jin)

### “勉为其难地承认”

    “勉为其难地承认”
    罗森堡夫妇被电椅处死已三年了，被控以“同谋犯”而身入囹圄的苏贝尔还在冤狱中受磨折。
    但是，罗森堡案件没有结束，苏贝尔也没有屈服。对法西斯暴行的控诉，为罗森堡夫妇和苏贝尔申张正义的斗争方兴未艾。
    最近，美国众院非美活动委员会发表了一篇长达一百三十七页的“报告”，对“为罗森堡夫妇和苏贝尔申张正义的全国委员会”进行恶毒的攻击。但“报告”却暴露了这个法西斯性质的机构对于这个委员会的正义活动得到越来越多的支持的事实，惶惶不可终日，它说：“必须勉为其难地承认，这种破坏是广泛的和持久的。”
    “报告”很容易地给了参加“全国委员会”的正义斗争的大多数人加以“亲共产党”的帽子，正像非美活动委员会很容易把任何一个敢于维护自己的人格和民主自由权利的普通美国人列入黑名单，加以迫害一样。但是，使非美活动委员会感到困难的是，参加这个正义斗争的还有它所无法随意加以罪名的人：这里有“好心肠的和不在意的人们”，有响应“人道主义号召”的人，有“宗教领袖”，有著名的原子能科学家尤雷博士，和已故的大科学家爱因斯坦博士。
    尤雷博士和爱因斯坦博士的支持，使得法西斯迫害者特别感到恼火。所以“报告”对他们也大肆污蔑，照“报告”的说法，尤雷是“站在这些原子间谍方面”，作了“最迷惑人们的宣传”。尤雷的声明揭穿了所谓“原子间谍案”的纯属虚构性质，他在罗森堡案上所采取的观点还得到了爱因斯坦的支持。“报告”想把这两位科学家的雄辩的正直指斥说成“宣传”，这是徒然的。
    法西斯的恐怖吓不退呼吁释放苏贝尔的斗争。莫顿·苏贝尔的母亲——一个六十多岁的典型的善良慈祥的美国普通母亲，最近从美洲到欧洲去为他的儿子呼吁主持正义。她说：“成千的热心朋友包围着我们，不仅帮忙我们去探问莫顿，甚至帮忙我们旅行全国和全世界，为莫顿呼吁主持公正，为莫顿而战”。苏贝尔母亲的呼吁得到广泛的同情和支持。
    使非美活动委员会的恐怖迫害狂人暴跳如雷的是，在他们的恐怖面前，人们不是后退了，而是升起了一种不可征服的力量，这个力量的名字就是正义，就是捍卫起码的民主自由的权利的坚强意志。
    堂堂美国国会的一个组织的“报告”，变成了罪恶的招供，变成了对美国式“民主”“自由”的辛辣的自我嘲讽。　（今）
