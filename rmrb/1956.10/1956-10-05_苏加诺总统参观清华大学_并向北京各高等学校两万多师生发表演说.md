Xinhua News Agency, 4th. President Sukarno told Beijing's university students today that the friendship between China and Indonesia is a sincere friendship, an eternal friendship, which no one can destroy.
    President Sukarno made these remarks in a speech delivered to the entire faculty and students of Tsinghua University and more than 20,000 representatives from various universities in Beijing after visiting Tsinghua University this morning.
    In his long speech, President Sukarno narrated the common tragic fate brought to the people of Asia and Africa by the colonialists from historical facts.
    Speaking of the struggles of people of all countries against colonialism and for national independence, the President said that these movements are not isolated. The movements of the people of all countries are actually a movement against imperialism and colonialism. Therefore, we are spiritually connected.
    President Sukarno repeatedly emphasized the importance of striving for national independence. He said, "We love our motherland. 'Once independent, forever independent!' This is the slogan we wholeheartedly support." The President reiterated what he said in the United States: "We are not prepared to sell an inch of land to anyone, we love independence."
    President Sukarno said that he was very happy to speak on the Tsinghua campus. Because Tsinghua University was born in 1901, and I was also born in 1901. Tsinghua University is fifty-five years old, and I am also fifty-five years old. Tsinghua University was founded by foreigners, and I was educated by foreigners. The students of Tsinghua University now oppose imperialism, and I now oppose imperialism.
    President Sukarno said that the power of young people is amazing. Let the young men and women of the world be connected, because the future of the world is in your hands.
    At the end of his speech, President Sukarno and all the welcomers raised their arms and shouted, "Merdeka" (Independence).
    President Sukarno's speech, which lasted more than an hour, was often interrupted by cheers and thunderous applause. University students holding Chinese and Indonesian flags and portraits of the President constantly waved flowers and shouted: "Bung Karno!" "Merdeka!" "Long live peace!" "Long live President Sukarno!"
    Before President Sukarno delivered his speech, Tsinghua University President Jiang Nanxiang delivered a speech to welcome President Sukarno and other distinguished guests from Indonesia. After President Sukarno's speech, Jiang Nanxiang, on behalf of all the faculty, students and staff of Tsinghua University, presented gifts to the President.
    President Sukarno also signed the President's speech collection and the President's collection of paintings at the request of the school.
    Before delivering his speech, President Sukarno, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi and Minister of Higher Education Yang Xiufeng, visited the university's hydraulic laboratory and civil engineering department. The President was warmly welcomed by teachers and students.

    苏加诺总统参观清华大学
    并向北京各高等学校两万多师生发表演说
    新华社4日讯　苏加诺总统今天对北京的大学生们说，中国和印度尼西亚两国间的友谊是真挚的友谊，永恒的友谊，是任何人也破坏不了的。
    苏加诺总统是在今天上午参观清华大学以后，向清华大学全体师生和北京各高等学校的代表两万多人发表的一篇演说中说这些话的。
    苏加诺总统在他的长篇演说里，从历史的事实中叙述了殖民主义者给亚非人民带来的共同的悲惨命运。
    谈到各国人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争时，总统说，这些运动都不是孤立的，各国人民的运动实际上是一个反对帝国主义和殖民主义的运动。因此，我们在精神上是互相联系在一起的。
    苏加诺总统一再强调争取民族独立的重要性。他说，我们热爱我们的祖国。“一经独立，永远独立！”这就是我们倾全力拥护的口号。总统重申他在美国时说过的话：“我们不准备出卖一寸土地给任何人，我们热爱独立。”
    苏加诺总统说他非常高兴在清华校园里讲话。因为清华大学诞生在1901年，我也生在1901年。清华大学五十五岁，我也五十五岁。清华大学是由外国人创办的，而我是受过外国人的教育。现在的清华大学的学生反对帝国主义，现在的我也反对帝国主义。
    苏加诺总统说，青年人的力量是惊人的。让世界的男女青年都联系在一起吧，因为，世界的未来是在你们的手中。
    在结束演说时，苏加诺总统同全体欢迎者一起振臂高呼：“默地加”（独立）。
    苏加诺总统长达一个多小时的讲话，常常被欢呼和雷动般的掌声所打断。举着中国印度尼西亚两国国旗和总统像的大学生们，不断挥舞着鲜花高呼：“朋加诺！”“默地加！”“和平万岁！”“苏加诺总统万岁！”
    苏加诺总统发表演说以前，清华大学校长蒋南翔致词欢迎苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚的其他贵宾们。苏加诺总统演说以后，蒋南翔又代表清华大学全体师生员工向总统送了礼品。
    苏加诺总统并应学校的请求在总统演说集和总统藏画集上签了名。
    在发表演说以前，苏加诺总统由陈毅副总理和高等教育部部长杨秀峰陪同参观了这所大学的水力实验馆和建筑工程系。总统受到了师生们的热情欢迎。
