　　Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, 9th: According to TASS, the Iranian newspaper "People's Echo" published an editorial stating that the Iranian government should implement an independent foreign policy and should always pay attention to the country's supreme interests. The country's supreme interests require us to establish diplomatic and trade relations with the People's Republic of China.
　　In an editorial entitled "People's China Must Be Recognized," "People's Echo" wrote that, with the exception of the United States and some countries that follow the United States' foreign policy, all countries in the world, large and small, have recognized the People's Republic of China and have established normal diplomatic and trade relations with the People's Republic of China.
　　The newspaper went on to say that it does not understand why the Iranian government has not yet recognized People's China and still recognizes the Chiang Kai-shek government as the legitimate government.
　　The newspaper pointed out that the lack of diplomatic relations between Iran and the People's Republic of China "causes great losses to Iran's foreign trade." It also pointed out that "ideological differences do not constitute a reason to refuse to establish diplomatic relations between the two countries."

    伊朗报纸要求承认中国
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社德黑兰9日讯：伊朗“人民回声报”发表社论说，伊朗政府应该执行独立的外交政策，并且应当始终注意国家的最高利益，而国家的最高利益要求我们同中华人民共和国建立外交和贸易的关系。
    “人民回声报”在一篇以“必须承认人民中国”为题的社论中写道，除了美国和追随美国外交政策的一些国家以外，世界上所有大、小国家都承认了中华人民共和国，并且同中华人民共和国建立了正常的外交和贸易的关系。
    报纸接着说，不了解为什么伊朗政府到现在还不承认人民中国而仍旧承认蒋介石政府是合法的政府。
    报纸指出，伊朗和中华人民共和国之间没有外交关系“使伊朗的对外贸易遭到很大的损失”。它还指出，“思想意识上有所不同并不能构成拒绝在两国之间建立外交关系的理由”。
