At 1:30 PM, the riot situation was still extremely serious. Groups of rioters gathered on the streets near Castle Peak Road, Tai Po Road, Yen Chow Street, Li Zhengwu Village, and Shek Kip Mei Village. Dozens of cars with Kuomintang flags and more than a hundred bicycles shuttled throughout the area. All ordinary vehicles and sparse pedestrians were stopped and questioned by the rioters, and those who said something unpleasant were immediately beaten severely. Many people were beaten down and vomited blood.

By 6 PM, rioters still controlled Sham Shui Po and Boundary Street. Groups of rioters paraded through the streets, holding iron tools as weapons. Rioters everywhere forced shops, residents and passing vehicles to hang Kuomintang flags, and those who resisted slightly were beaten severely.

A curfew began in the Kowloon area at 7:30 PM tonight. Many residents took their families and fled across the sea to Hong Kong today afternoon.

    九龙暴徒骚动事件继续扩大
    广东省银行九龙分行被暴徒焚烧
    新华社广州11日电　香港今日下午六时消息：国民党特务分子在九龙地区进行的大规模骚动今天继续扩大。整个九龙地区陷入极度混乱中。有组织的暴徒又在许多条街道的商店住户纵火焚烧和大事抢劫。商店全部停业，人心惶惶，恐怖的气氛弥漫着整个九龙地区。
    昨天中午发生的九龙大骚动经短暂的停息后，今晨暴徒们又重新活动。上午八时，深水埗李郑屋村又有人纵火，把昨天剩下来的徙置区办事处的大门焚烧。暴徒冲入附近的办事处职员宿舍，把那里的衣物家具全部搬出焚烧，当时，香港英国警察没有赶到现场，暴徒为所欲为。情况又恢复了昨天的混乱。
    有组织的暴徒从这时开始到处骚动。青山道的广州公司被焚，中建土产公司和华南玩具金属制品厂遭受几百个暴徒袭击达一个钟头，没有警察人员赶来抢救；中建土产公司的货物被抢劫一空，玩具厂的机器被捣毁。
    今日上午十一时，骚动事态更加扩大。暴徒达万余人。九龙英国警察署被包围。暴徒和香港英国警察在深水埗一带混战，互有损伤。深水埗东京街香港安全胶轮公司门前和青山道嘉顿制饼公司附近的草坪，在混乱中共有二人重伤身亡。
    香港英国当局今日下午一时发表公报，警告暴徒：如暴徒继续作乱，当严厉对付。英国军队已经出动镇压，并派出飞机向暴徒投掷催泪弹。
    下午一时三十分，暴乱情况仍极为严重。一批一批的暴徒聚集在青山道、大埔道、钦州街、李郑屋村和石硖尾村附近一带的街道上。几十辆挂上国民党旗帜的汽车和百多辆单车在整个地区穿梭来往。所有的普通车辆和稀疏的行人都被暴徒拦劫盘问，言不顺耳的立即被毒打，曾有多人被打倒吐血。
    到下午六时，暴徒仍控制深水埗、界限街一带。成群结队的暴徒招摇过市，手持铁器作为武器。暴徒们到处压迫商店住户和往来车辆悬挂国民党旗帜，稍有抗拒，就被痛打。
    九龙地区今晚七时三十分开始戒严。许多居民在今日下午纷纷携老扶幼渡海到香港逃难。
    截至今日下午六时止，据不完全统计，两天来在骚乱中有七人身死，一百多人受伤。
    新华社广州11日电　香港今日下午九时消息：今天下午英军开进九龙市区，开枪射击。但骚乱地区尚未被控制。骚乱仍在扩大中。
    新华社香港分社附近已发现有大批暴徒集中，有准备发动新的暴行的迹象。在弥敦道的广东省银行九龙分行被暴徒纵火焚烧。在九龙仔的大华小学也被焚。在青山道的中建公司等也被毁。现时九龙交通已全部停顿。
    今天下午三点钟，英军用飞机向肇事地区投掷催泪弹。
    香港英国当局已宣布，九龙地区从今天下午七点半到明天早上十点钟实施戒严。如骚动事件不停止，戒严时间将继续延长。九龙和香港之间的轮渡，已在下午七点十五分停止。香港情况平静，但谣传今天晚上，暴徒将用手枪、手榴弹袭击香港弯仔区工会、报馆等处。
    香港代理总督戴维今晚八时在广播电台发表演说，警告暴徒勿继续采取非法行动。他说，香港英国政府“决心马上弹压这些骚乱，并将采取任何必要措施来保证做到这一点。”
    新华社广州11日电　香港二十三时消息：国民党特务分子制造的九龙地区的骚乱有向隔海的香港岛发展的趋势。现在香港岛方面已经发现有三五成群的暴徒的踪迹。虽然香港英国当局宣布戒严，从下午七时一刻起香港和九龙间的轮渡停开，但九龙方面的暴徒有数百人乘帆船渡海到香港西环。在戒严期间，九龙的匪徒仍四面出动，情况极其混乱。许多住宅和商店被抢掠，街上时闻凄厉的惨叫声。晚上七时三十分九龙全区戒严，八时三十分以后，英方军警用排枪扫射街上暴徒，但骚乱并未制止。直到深夜发电时止，暴徒们仍在九龙东头村一带大肆抢劫。新华社香港分社仍处在暴徒的威胁中。
