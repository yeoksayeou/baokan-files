Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Shanghai's three state-owned wool textile factories have signed factory mutual assistance and learning contracts with thirteen joint state-private wool textile factories. In just six months, this has enabled the joint state-private factories to rapidly improve their production management. Four of these factories have reached or surpassed the production management level of advanced factories, and eight have reached the level of medium-sized factories. In August, eight of the thirteen factories comprehensively achieved all four indicators of output value, production volume, quality, and labor productivity, and seven factories had first-class product rates of over 98%.

　　These sixteen factories were voluntarily organized according to the principles of similar products and geographical proximity. The methods of mutual assistance and learning are very flexible. The state-owned factories systematically and comprehensively introduced to the joint ventures their experience in implementing the three major systems of wool textile dyeing and finishing and in promoting operational planning, first helping the joint ventures to stabilize and improve product quality, laying the foundation for planned management. When introducing these experiences, the state-owned factories focused on introducing the difficult problems they had encountered in their previous work and the solutions, and provided relevant information without reservation. The methods of introduction included giving large lectures to the joint venture factories and sending specialists to help solve specific problems.

　　The three state-owned wool textile factories have also learned some valuable production experiences from the joint venture factories. In the past six months, the state-owned No. 3 Wool Textile Factory has learned from the joint venture Xinhua Lun Wool Textile Factory the experience of shortening the dyeing and finishing time of wool fabrics; the state-owned No. 2 Wool Textile Factory has also learned from the joint venture China Wool Textile Factory the method of weighing yarn by the gram, solving the problem of the slight underweight of yarn that they had not been able to solve for a long time.

　　The greatest benefit of this mutual assistance and learning method is that it can give full play to the role of advanced factories and drive the newly joint venture factories to quickly catch up to the level of advanced factories in a relatively short period of time. At the same time, the state-owned factories have also avoided the phenomenon of being too busy to cope with visitors for observation and study, because their assistance targets are relatively fixed.

    上海三个国营毛纺织厂
    帮助公私合营工厂提高生产管理水平
    据新华社讯　上海三个国营毛纺织厂和十三个公私合营毛纺织厂签订了厂际互助互学合同。仅仅半年的时间内，就使公私合营厂迅速改进了生产管理，其中四个厂达到或者超过了先进厂的生产管理水平，八个厂达到了中等厂的水平。8月份，十三个厂中有八个厂全面达到了产值、产量、质量和劳动生产率等四项指标，七个厂的产品一等品在98％以上。
    这十六个厂都是按照产品相同、地区相近，自愿组织起来的。互助互学的方式很灵活。由国营厂系统全面地向合营厂介绍了如何贯彻毛纺织品染整三大制度和推行作业计划的经验，首先帮助合营厂稳定和改进了产品质量，打下了计划管理的基础。国营厂在介绍这些经验的时候，着重介绍了自己厂以往工作中所遇到的疑难问题以及解决的办法，并无保留地供给有关资料。介绍的方式，有时给合营厂上大课讲解，有时派专人帮助解决具体问题。
    三个国营毛纺织厂也从合营厂学到一些可贵的生产经验。半年来，国营第三毛纺织厂已经从合营新华纶毛纺织厂学到了缩短毛织品染整时间的经验；国营第二毛纺织厂也向合营中国毛纺厂学到了绒线分克过磅的办法，解决了他们长时间内没有解决的绒线分量偏轻的问题。
    这种互助互学方式的最大好处，是可以充分发挥先进厂的作用，带动新合营厂，在较短时期内，迅速赶上先进厂的水平。同时，国营厂也因帮助对象比较固定，避免了以往那样忙于应付参观学习者的现象。
