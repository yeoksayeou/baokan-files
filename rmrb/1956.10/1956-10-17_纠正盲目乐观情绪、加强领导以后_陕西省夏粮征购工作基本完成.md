Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, October 14th: By October 5th, over 95% of the summer grain purchased in Shaanxi Province had been put into storage. In the Guanzhong area, where summer harvest is the main focus, Huayin, Tongguan, Jingyang and other counties began universally receiving new grain into warehouses in July. By the end of July, over 80% of the summer grain had been put into storage. However, leaders in some counties, districts, and townships failed to make specific arrangements for the grain storage work. Among some grassroots cadres, there was insufficient understanding of the complexity of production, procurement, and sales quotas set at the agricultural cooperative level, leading to blind optimism. Some grain workers failed to effectively connect with agricultural cooperatives to arrange storage work, and their mastery of grain inspection and grading techniques was also insufficient, which made the progress of new grain storage work in these areas very slow. In mid-August, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee held a reporting meeting for the summer grain procurement and sales inspection team, promptly reversing these situations and requiring all localities to strengthen leadership and actively organize summer grain storage. Each county in the Weinan Special District successively held three-level cadre meetings, criticizing cadres' slackening attitude towards grain work, and designated grain work as the central focus of September. Most counties completed their summer grain storage tasks on schedule. The Baoji Special District also convened a telephone conference of county heads and grain bureau chiefs, and each county immediately established a dedicated person responsibility system for grain work, with county heads and township heads personally leading the grain requisition and purchase work. In addition to strengthening leadership over grain work, many areas widely and deeply publicized the state's grain policy to farmers, enabling them to correctly understand the relationship between individual, cooperative, and state interests. The "May Fourth" and other eleven agricultural cooperatives in Ningqiang County segregated and separately dried good grain during harvesting. They organized more than 900 people to sell over 80,000 catties of new grain to the state granary in half a day. Many areas actively helped agricultural cooperatives balance grain surpluses and deficits within the cooperatives. Many agricultural cooperatives in Jingyang, Sanyuan and other counties, in addition to completing the state's grain requisition tasks, also properly solved the grain needs of cooperative members with less labor and larger populations, ensuring that the cooperative had public grain and the members had the necessary grain for consumption.

At present, in Shaanxi Province, the unified purchase and sale of grain has been fully completed in Guanzhong and parts of northern Shaanxi where summer harvest is the main focus, and the organization of storage continues. In southern and northern Shaanxi, where autumn harvest is the main focus, the preliminary delivery and pre-sale of summer grain into storage is nearing completion, and the unified purchase and sale of autumn grain is being actively arranged.

    纠正盲目乐观情绪、加强领导以后
    陕西省夏粮征购工作基本完成
    新华社西安14日电　到10月5日，陕西省夏季征购的粮食已有95％以上入库。以夏收为主的关中地区的华阴、潼关、泾阳等县在7月开始普遍接收新粮入仓。到7月底入仓夏粮就已达到80％以上，但部分县、区、乡领导未能认真对粮食入仓工作进行具体安排，在部分基层干部中又对以农业社为单位的定产、定购、定销工作的复杂性认识不足，存在着盲目乐观情绪，有的粮食工作人员不能很好地和农业社取得联系，安排入仓工作，在验粮分等技术上也掌握得不够好，使这些地区新粮入仓工作进度十分缓慢。陕西省人民委员会8月中旬召开夏粮征购销检查工作组汇报会议，及时扭转这些情况，并要求各地加强领导，积极组织夏粮入仓。渭南专区各县都先后召开了三级干部会议，批判干部中对粮食工作松劲思想，并将粮食工作作为9月份工作中心，大部分县都按期完成了夏粮入仓任务。宝鸡专区并召开各县县长、粮食局长电话会议，各县随即普遍建立了粮食工作专人负责制，由县长、乡长亲自领导粮食征、购工作。许多地区除加强对粮食工作的领导外，并广泛深入地向农民宣传国家粮食政策，使农民正确认识个人、社和国家利益的关系。宁强县“五四”等十一个农业社在收割时就把好粮单收单晒，他们组织了九百多人在半天内就把八万多斤新粮交售给国家粮库。不少地区积极帮助农业社内进行了粮食余缺的平衡工作。泾阳、三原等县的许多农业社除完成国家粮食征购任务外，还妥善解决了劳力少、人口多的社员的用粮困难，保证了社内有公用粮和社员有必须食用的粮食。
    目前，陕西省粮食统购统销工作，在以夏收为主的关中及陕北部分县计购计销已全部完成，正继续组织入仓；在以秋收为主的陕南、陕北地区的夏粮预交预售入仓工作即将结束，并正在积极安排秋粮的统购统销。
