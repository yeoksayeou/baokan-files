Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Many folk arts and crafts with unique styles in Tianjin have regained their brilliance. The old artist Liu Fengming, known as "Brick Carver Liu," had switched to being a bricklayer, but last year he picked up his brick carving tools, which he had stored away for more than twenty years. The figures and animals he carves are detailed and vivid, and works like "Lion Picture" and "The Three Heroes of the Tang Dynasty" display high artistic skill. Currently, his carved soapstone lamp bases are often in short supply. The Tianjin Handicraft Production Cooperative Union also takes great care of his work, trying to purchase raw materials for him and helping him trial-produce new works. The old artist Wei Yuan-tai, known as "Kite Wei," has been engaged in kite making for more than sixty years. The figures and animals he makes from colored silk can be folded up for easy carrying. He now receives many orders for kites. Zhang Ming and Zhang Yue, the fourth generation of "Clay Figure Zhang," have recently begun to specialize in painted clay sculptures. Zhang Ming's recent work, "Presenting a Gift to National Day," vividly portrays the joyous mood of the children of the New China. Zhang Yue is also creating images of laborers from the "three hundred and sixty trades," such as blacksmiths, shoemakers, and sugar blowers, inherited from his ancestors.

    The relevant departments in Tianjin have also organized the old artists of the Su lacquer inlay and wood carving industries, who had already changed careers, to establish production cooperatives. Industries such as silk flower, grass basket, and embroidery have also established specialized production cooperatives. Some scattered old artists are still producing at home. Currently, there are twenty-two kinds of folk crafts organized for production in Tianjin, including paper cutting, kites, clay figurines, wood carvings, carpets, porcelain carving, and velvet flowers. The number of folk handicraft workers participating in production has grown to more than 3,000. Some artists who had previously experienced difficult living conditions and inappropriate job placements have also gradually received care. Some old artists have been elected as People's Representatives and members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference because of their achievements in their work and the love of the people.

    天津民间工艺重放光彩
    据新华社讯　天津市许多具有独特风格的民间工艺美术品，重新发出了光彩。被称为“刻砖刘”的老艺人刘凤鸣，曾经改行做泥瓦匠，去年又重新拿起收藏了二十多年的刻砖工具。他刻的人物、禽兽等形象细致而又鲜明，如“狮图”、“风尘三侠”都具有高度的艺术技巧。目前他雕刻的滑石台灯座经常供不应求。天津市手工业生产合作社联合社也非常照顾他的创作，设法替他购买原料，帮助他试制新的作品。被称为“风筝魏”的老艺人魏元泰，从事风筝手工艺已六十多年了。他用彩绢制成的人物、禽兽等形象的风筝可以折叠起来携带。现在各方面向他订做的风筝很多。“泥人张”的第四代张铭、张钺，最近开始专门从事彩塑。张铭最近完成的“向国庆节献礼”的作品，生动地刻划了新中国儿童的喜悦心情。张钺也正在创作祖传的打铁匠、缝鞋的、吹糖人等“三百六十行”的劳动人民形象。
    天津市有关部门还将已经转业了的苏漆镶嵌和木器雕刻行业的老艺人组织起来，成立了生产合作社。绢花、草提篮、刺绣等行业也分别成立了专业生产合作社。一些分散的老艺人仍在家中生产。现在天津市共有剪纸、风筝、捏泥人、木雕、地毯、刻磁和绒花等二十二种民间工艺品的行业已组织起来生产，参加生产的民间手工艺工作者已发展到三千多人。一些过去生活困难和工作安排不当的艺人，也都陆续得到了照顾。有的老艺人因为工作上的成就，受到人民群众的爱戴，还被选为人民代表、政协委员。
