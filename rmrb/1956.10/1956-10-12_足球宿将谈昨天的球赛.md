Veteran Football Players Discuss Yesterday's Game
    Diān Yì Guó'ān
    Yesterday afternoon, after the football selection match between the combined Red team and the Shanghai team, the reporter interviewed Li Fenglou, a famous football player who enjoyed a high reputation in the country more than ten years ago and is now an international football referee, and Dai Linjing, the most famous center forward in the country ten years ago, who is now the coach of the "August 1st" football team, to ask them for their opinions on this game.
    "This game is outstanding in domestic football matches. Both sides fully demonstrated their skills. The attacking routes were clear, and the ball was played cleanly and decisively," Li Fenglou said to the reporter as his first remark.
    Yesterday, the combined Red team adopted the forward crossover tactic they were good at during the attack, using triangular short passes to break through the opponent's middle. The Shanghai team's characteristics during the attack were to use two fast-paced wingers to cut into the penalty area to shoot and use headers. Both sides knew each other well, fought wits and courage, making the game even more exciting.
    Li Fenglou believes that the combined Red team's strategic deployment was superior, and the players were able to complete their tasks well. Left inside forward Fang Renqiu played very seriously. He actively competed for the ball and often ran in the opponent's gaps. Therefore, he had more shooting opportunities in the first half, but unfortunately, the shots were weak. Center forward Shi Wanchun and right inside forward Zhang Honggen played the role of organizing the attack. They were clear-headed, passed the ball accurately, and could both shoot, so the opponent also used their main strength to guard them. But even so, thirteen minutes after the start of the game, Zhang Honggen still passed the ball to comrade Yu in a short pass, crossed the Shanghai team's defenders, and scored the first goal. Zhang Honggen's spirit of overcoming difficulties is not enough. Several times he got the ball half a step earlier than the opponent, but he would rather pull the ball back instead of dribbling into the area. The combined Red team's half-backs Zhang Jingtian and Chen Chengda have made great progress. They can control most of the midfield ball and can also assist in the attack.
    Dai Linjing said, "If the combined Red team's forwards could move within a small range in the opponent's penalty area like Hungarian and Yugoslav football players, they could have scored more goals in this game." He also believes that the Shanghai team's adoption of zone defense, even bringing the wingers back to defend, is not a perfect solution. When the Hungarian football team came to our country to play, we used dense defense, leaving only one or two players outside, thus being in a passive position of being beaten. The Shanghai team's strategy also has similar problems. Only Chen Longquan was left outside as the forward, and the fast-paced wingers such as Ma Jinsheng were all called back, resulting in no one to cooperate with the attack, many goals conceded, and the forward's striking power could not be brought into play. Although this increased the difficulty for the opponent's forwards to shoot, the wingers could easily dribble the ball and cross it, and there was bound to be a tense situation in front of the goal frequently.
    Li Fenglou believes that the Shanghai team's change in the second half from long passes from the center back to the center to wingers crossing the ball from oblique lines was correct. In this way, several forwards can rush to the opponent's penalty area together and besiege the goal. In the second half, the Shanghai team put winger Ma Jinsheng in front, relieving him of the task of defending. Dai Linjing believes that this change is also correct. In this way, after the Shanghai team intercepts the ball, the winger can immediately cut into the opponent's hinterland, giving the opponent a great threat. However, because the Shanghai team's defenders narrowed the defensive area, the half-backs could not quickly organize the attack after getting the ball, and most of the forwards retreated to assist in the defense, leaving only one forward in front, which was ineffective.
    Finally, Dai Linjing and Li Fenglou felt that the Shanghai team's left winger Ma Jinsheng is fast, good at heading, and willing to actively grab the ball. He is a very promising winger. Defender Wang Yuelin is good at grabbing the ball, has confidence when competing for headers, and has a large defensive area, saving many dangerous balls. He is an excellent defender. Zhao Guanghua and Chen Longquan are also good forwards.

    足球宿将谈昨天的球赛
  　甸义·国安
    昨日下午，足球选拔赛联队红队对上海队的比赛结束后，记者访问了十几年前在国内享有盛誉的足球名将、国际足球裁判李凤楼和十年前国内最著名的中锋、现担任“八一”足球队指导的戴麟经，请他们就这场比赛发表一些意见。
    “这场比赛在国内足球比赛中是特出的，双方都充分发挥了技术，攻球的路线清楚，球踢得干净俐落。”李凤楼对记者的第一句话就这样说。
    昨天联队红队在进攻时，采用了擅长的前锋交叉换位，利用三角短传突破对方中间的战术。上海队在进攻时的特点，则是利用两个边锋速度快切入禁区进行打门和用头球攻门。双方知己知彼、斗智斗力，使这场球赛更加扣人心弦了。
    李凤楼认为：联队红队的战略部署是比较优越的，队员们都能很好地完成任务。左内锋方纫秋踢得相当认真，他积极争夺球，经常在对方空隙地带跑动，因此上半场他的射门机会是比较多的，只可惜射出的球软弱无力。中锋史万春和右内锋张宏根担任了组织进攻的角色，他们头脑很清醒，给球准确，又都会射门，所以对方也用主要力量看守他们。但是即使这样，在比赛开始后的十三分钟时，张宏根仍和从者余互相短传，越过了上海队后卫，先射入一球。张宏根克服困难的精神还不够，有几次他比对方早半步得了球，他也宁愿把球拉回来，不带球切入。联队红队的前卫张京天和陈成达的进步很大，他们能控制住大部分中场球，还能向前助攻。
    戴麟经说：“如果联队红队前锋能像匈牙利和南斯拉夫足球队员那样在对方禁区小范围内活动，这场比赛他们就可以踢进更多的球。”他还认为上海队采用区域防守，甚至把边锋都调回来防守，不是十全十美的办法。过去匈牙利足球队来我国比赛的时候，我们就是密集防守，前锋只留一两个队员在外面，因此处于挨打的被动地位。上海队的策略也有类似的毛病，前锋只留陈龙泉一人在外面，把速度快的边锋马津生等都调了回来，结果进攻无人配合，失球多，前锋的突击力量没能发挥出来；这样虽然增加了对方前锋射门的困难，但是边锋很容易带球传中，门前必定要经常出现紧张的局面。
    李凤楼认为上海队在下半场把中卫长传高球至中央改为边锋从斜线将球传中的战术是正确的，这样，几个前锋可以一起赶向对方禁区，围攻大门。在下半场上海队将边锋马津生放到了前面，解除他退守的任务。戴麟经认为这个改变也是正确的。这样上海队截住球后，边锋马上可以向对方腹地切入，给对方很大威胁。但是由于上海队的后卫缩小防守区域，前卫得球后不能很快地组织进攻，而前锋多数又退后协助防守，前面只有一个前锋，孤掌难鸣。
    最后，戴麟经和李凤楼觉得上海队的左边锋马津生速度快、头球好，肯积极抢球，是一个很有希望的边锋。后卫王岳林抢球好，争头球时有把握，防守面积大，解救了不少险球，是一个出色的后卫。赵光华、陈龙泉也是不错的前锋。
