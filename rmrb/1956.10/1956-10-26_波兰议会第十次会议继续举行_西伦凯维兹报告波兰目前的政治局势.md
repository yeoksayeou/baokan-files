Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 25th (Dispatch) - According to the Polish Press Agency, the tenth session of the Polish People's Republic Parliament continued on October 24th at 11:00 AM. Attending the meeting were members of the State Council led by Chairman of the State Council Zawadzki, and ministers of various departments of the government led by Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz. The diplomatic and press galleries were completely full. The public gallery was also full, with some people standing.

At the beginning of the debate, Speaker Dambowski informed the parliament that the Chairman of the Council of Ministers had agreed to make a statement at today's meeting regarding the motion raised by MP Hochfeld the previous day. Dambowski also said that the meeting of heads of delegations recommended that after the Chairman of the Council of Ministers delivered his speech, the parliament should begin discussing the parliamentary election law. The Speaker then announced that after the discussion of the election law, the issue of reorganizing the Council of Ministers should be placed on the agenda.

After announcing these matters, Speaker Dambowski invited Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz to speak.

Cyrankiewicz reported on Poland's current political situation at the meeting.

Cyrankiewicz first spoke about some of the documents that had been published, such as Gomulka's report at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and some of the communiqués that had been issued; he also told the members of parliament that the government intended to reduce the composition of the Presidium of the government, ensure greater autonomy for the ministers of various departments, and further merge the departments.

He further emphasized that the opinions expressed by the members of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party at the Eighth Plenary Session, and the support of the working class and the overwhelming majority of the people of the country for the resolutions they passed, ended the debate on whether to retreat from the path of democratization or to unswervingly continue along this path.

Cyrankiewicz said: If there is any doubt as to whether anyone has exceeded the scope of legal activities in the past few days, I would like you to note that the Party and the government will investigate these matters together with Comrade Rokossovsky (it is quite clear that Comrade Rokossovsky has strictly followed the instructions of the Party and the government) and draw appropriate conclusions.

Cyrankiewicz spoke of the irreversible nature of the process now underway in Poland, and also of the support given by the people of the country to the decisions made in the past few days. He said that this support is extremely valuable. The fundamental issue now is calm and discipline.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers emphasized the fundamental importance of the Soviet-Polish alliance and Soviet-Polish friendship, established on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and each other's rights. He explained that without the Soviet Union, or in opposition to the Soviet Union, as some madmen might dream, it would be impossible to build socialism in Poland. We want to build the relations between our two countries and two parties on the basis of equal principles, and to get rid of anything that might violate these principles. The talks held in Warsaw between the members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and the members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union were an important step in observing these principles. This meeting was conducted in an atmosphere of genuine candor between the parties. We have every reason to say that, according to the intentions of the two parties, the purpose of further talks is to further consolidate the principles of cooperation on the basis of equality, solidarity, and respect for each other's rights.

Cyrankiewicz announced that in the next two days, all Soviet troops will be completely stationed within the bases that exist under international treaties. These treaties are determined according to the needs of Polish security, especially in the face of German revisionism.

Cyrankiewicz asked everyone to pay attention to the anti-Soviet "impulses" that had occurred. He went on to say: In overcoming these "impulses," we have received the assistance of the Polish working class and the majority of the public, who hope to maintain the best relations with our allies on the principles of equal rights and governing our own country ourselves. I can assure you that in Poland, no decision is taken that is not taken by our leading bodies, which have the support of the people of the country. This situation is now in the interests of the socialist camp and the international working-class movement, and also in the interests of maintaining true friendship with the Soviet Union—friendship based on mutual respect for sovereignty and mutual trust.

Finally, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers emphasized that the support given by the people of the country to our leadership should be manifested in helping the Party achieve the tasks stipulated in Gomulka's report. What is needed now is social discipline, a sense of responsibility, and a firm attitude against indiscipline. By adopting such an attitude, we will be able to continue along the path that has been planned to strengthen socialism and international friendship.

After Cyrankiewicz's report, the meeting continued.

    波兰议会第十次会议继续举行
    西伦凯维兹报告波兰目前的政治局势
    新华社华沙25日电　据波兰通讯社报道：波兰人民共和国议会第十次会议10月24日上午11时继续举行。参加会议的有国务委员会主席萨瓦茨基所率领的国务委员会的委员们以及由部长会议主席西伦凯维兹所率领的政府各部部长。外交和记者旁听席上统统坐满了人。公众旁听席上也坐满了人，有些人还站着。
    在开始辩论的时候，议长邓博夫斯基告诉议会说，部长会议主席已经同意就霍赫费耳特议员在前一天提出的动议在今天的会议上发表谈话。邓博夫斯基还说，各代表团团长会议建议在部长会议主席发表他的谈话后，议会应该开始讨论议会选举法。议长接着宣布：在选举法讨论之后，应该把部长会议改组的问题列入议程。
    议长邓博夫斯基在宣布这些事情之后，请部长会议主席西伦凯维兹发言。
    西伦凯维兹在会议上报告了波兰目前的政治局势。
    西伦凯维兹首先谈到已经公布过的一些文件，如哥穆尔卡在波兰统一工人党中央委员会第八次全体会议上所作的报告和已经发表的一些公报；他并且告诉议员们说政府打算缩小政府主席团的组成，保证各部部长有更大的自主权，并且进一步合并各部。
    他进一步强调指出：波兰统一工人党中央委员会委员们在八中全会上所表示的意见，以及工人阶级和全国压倒大多数人民对他们所通过的决议的支持，终止了从民主化道路上倒退还是坚持不渝地继续沿着这条道路前进的争论。
    西伦凯维兹说：如果对过去几天中有没有人越出合法活动范围的问题有什么疑问的话，我希望你们注意这样一点：党和政府将同罗科索夫斯基同志（罗科索夫斯基同志严格执行着党和政府的指示，这一点是十分明显的）一起调查这些事情，并且得出适当的结论。
    西伦凯维兹谈到现在波兰所进行的进程具有不可倒转的性质，也谈到全国人民对过去几天中作出的决定所给予的支持。他说，这种支持是极端宝贵的。当前的根本问题是平静和纪律。
    部长会议主席强调在互相尊重主权和彼此的权利的基础上建立的波苏联盟和波苏友谊的根本重要意义。他说明，如果没有苏联，或者像某些疯子可能会梦想的那样反对苏联，要在波兰建设社会主义是不可能的。我们要把我们两国和两党的关系建立在平等的原则的基础上，并且要摆脱任何可能会违背这些原则的东西。波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员们同苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员们在华沙举行的会谈，是在遵守这些原则方面的一个重要步骤。这次会谈是在党的真诚相见的气氛中进行的。我们完全有理由可以说，根据两党的意图，进一步的会谈的目的是要进一步巩固在平等、团结和尊重彼此权利的基础上进行合作的原则。
    西伦凯维兹宣布：在今后两天内，所有苏联军队都将完全驻在根据国际条约而存在的基地以内。这些条约是根据波兰安全的需要，特别是在面对德国修正主义的情况下的需要所决定的。
    西伦凯维兹请大家注意曾经发生过的反苏“冲动”的这种情况。他接着说：在克服这些“冲动”的工作中，我们得到了波兰工人阶级和大多数公众的协助，他们希望在权利平等和由我们自己治理自己国家的原则上同我们的盟国保持最好的关系。我可以保证，在波兰，没有任何决定不是由得到全国人民支持的我们的领导机构所采取的。现在这种情况是符合社会主义阵营和国际工人阶级运动的利益的，也是符合同苏联保持真正的友谊——建立在互相尊重主权和互相信任的基础上的友谊的利益的。
    最后，部长会议主席着重指出，全国人民对我国的领导机构所给予的支持应该表现在帮助党实现哥穆尔卡的报告中所规定的各项任务上。现在需要的是社会纪律、责任感和反对缺乏纪律现象的坚决态度。采取这样一种态度，我们将能沿着已经规划好的加强社会主义和国际友谊的道路继续前进。
    西伦凯维兹报告结束以后，会议继续进行。
