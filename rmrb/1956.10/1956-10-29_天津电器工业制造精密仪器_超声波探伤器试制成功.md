    Tianjin Electrical Industry Manufactures Precision Instrument
    Ultrasonic Flaw Detector Successfully Trial-Produced
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 27th: A precise ultrasonic flaw detector has recently been successfully trial-produced at the joint state-private owned electrical manufacturing factory of the Tianjin Electrical Industry Company. This instrument can be used to inspect metal or non-metal up to five meters thick for sand holes, cracks, or other defects, something that X-ray machines and other instruments cannot do.
    From March to September this year, the more than 200 factories under the Tianjin Electrical Industry Company have successfully trial-produced a total of 47 new products, many of which are precision, high-level products. For example, the joint state-private electrical manufacturing factory successfully trial-produced five kinds of precision electronic instruments this year, including the ultrasonic flaw detector and electronic oscilloscope. The joint state-private switchboard factory produced Soviet-style switchboards for controlling electricity. The joint state-private electrical instrument factory successfully trial-produced power factor meters, wattmeters, voltmeters, and Soviet-style ammeters for switchboards used for electrical testing.
    The factories manufacturing these precision products are mostly joint state-private enterprises with only forty or fifty employees and relatively few new-style equipment. In the past, they mostly manufactured small electrical accessories or low-level products. Since the implementation of joint state-private ownership, dispersed technical forces and equipment have been concentrated. The better engineering and technical personnel and experienced technicians from various factories, under the unified leadership of the Electrical Industry Company, have formed fifteen technical core groups according to product type to research, design, and trial-produce various new products.

    天津电器工业制造精密仪器
    超声波探伤器试制成功
    据新华社天津27日讯　一种精密的超声波探伤器，最近在天津市电器工业公司公私合营电器制造厂试制成功。用这种仪器可以检查五公尺厚的金属或非金属内部有没有砂眼、裂痕或其他毛病，这是爱克斯光机等仪器所不能做到的。
    天津市电器工业公司所属的二百多个工厂，从今年3月到9月，共试制成功了四十七种新产品，其中有很多是精密的高级产品。如公私合营电器制造厂，今年就试制成功了超声波探伤器电子示波器等五种精密的电子仪器。公私合营开关板厂制成的用做控制电力的仿苏型号开关板。公私合营电工仪表厂试制成的用做电器试验的功率因数表、功率表、电压表、开关板用的仿苏型号电流表。
    制造这些精密产品的工厂，绝大部分是只有四、五十个职工的公私合营工厂，新式设备也较少，过去大都只制造一些小型电器配件或低级产品。自从实行公私合营以后，分散的技术力量和设备集中了，各工厂较好的工程技术人员和老技术工人在电器工业公司统一领导下，按产品类型组成了十五个技术核心小组，研究设计和试制各种新产品。
