    内蒙开始粮食油料统购工作
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区开始秋季粮食、油料统购工作。到10月10日，全区已购进各种粮食、油料七万八千二百四十三吨。其中，在连年丰收的河套行政区就收购了三万三千吨以上。
    哲里木盟各族农民在收割打场期间就按照国家定购数字，不断卖出粮食。国家在9月份就从这个地区收购了三千一百多吨粮食和油料。大青山南麓的土默特旗的三百五十一个农业社已提出保证完成国家核定的统购计划，现在已将二千四百多吨粮食卖给了国家。
    各地商业部门在秋粮收购期间，为农民准备了大批物资。仅百货系统在第四季度就增多了一千多种新商品。内蒙古自治区纺织品公司为了及时供应各族农牧民过冬需要，到9月底已提前供应各地各种棉布一百六十一万五千匹。据内蒙古自治区供销合作社统计，近两个月来各族农民买去的农具仅双轮双铧犁就有三万多件。
