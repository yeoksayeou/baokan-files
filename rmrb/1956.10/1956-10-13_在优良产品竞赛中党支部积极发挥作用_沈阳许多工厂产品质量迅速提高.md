    In the Excellent Product Competition, Party Branches Actively Play a Role
    Product Quality Improves Rapidly in Many Factories in Shenyang

    (Our Dispatch) Since the launch of the Excellent Product Competition in April this year, many grass-roots Party organizations – branches – in Shenyang’s heavy industry, machinery, and light industry systems have played a fortress role.

    Since the launch of the Excellent Product Competition in April this year, many branches have paid attention to investigating and analyzing the causes of defective products; they have also paid attention to improving publicity work. Before the launch of the Excellent Product Competition, the rejection rate in the processing workshop of the Shenyang Fan Factory was 1.29%, exceeding the state-stipulated target of 0.29%. Among the production workers in this workshop, those who frequently produced defective products accounted for more than 50%. After investigation, in addition to some workers producing defective products due to low technical skills, many workers had the mentality that "completing the plan is a hero, and a few defective products don't matter." Some said: "A few defective products can be made up for by overfulfilling the quota!" Based on these reflections, the branch comprehensively summarized the shortcomings in past publicity work, paid attention to publicizing the idea of comprehensively completing the plan, and in the advanced producer study class held in the workshop, focused on introducing the advanced thinking of advanced producer Wang Zungui in guaranteeing product quality and overfulfilling tasks. At the same time, considering that the "Defective Product Exhibition Platform" often used in the past to promote product quality affected workers' self-esteem and few workers went to see it, the branch changed the "Defective Product Exhibition Platform" to an "Excellent Product Exhibition Platform." In front of the Excellent Product Exhibition Platform, inspections or technicians were organized to explain how excellent products are produced, so that after listening, the workers not only understood what excellent products are, but also knew how to produce excellent products. Because the workers recognized the importance of improving product quality, by the end of September, the rejection rate of the entire workshop had been reduced to 0.53%, remaining below the state-stipulated target.

    In the Excellent Product Competition, many branches also paid attention to summarizing and promoting advanced experiences in improving product quality. The branch of the tool workshop of the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory summarized the experience of young worker Zhu Junyao, who had not produced any defective products for two years, in June this year, and organized the entire workshop to study it universally. By the end of August, two hundred and twenty-eight sets of excellent molds had appeared.

    The fortress role of the Party branch is reflected in the exemplary actions of Party members to ensure the implementation of the resolutions made by the branch. Communist Party members in the processing workshop branch of the Shenyang Fan Factory, in order to improve product quality, have all formulated their own plans to guarantee product quality and help the masses. By the end of September, most of the Party members in the entire workshop had eliminated defective products. With the help of Party members, workers who frequently produced defective products in the past have also eliminated defective products.

    在优良产品竞赛中党支部积极发挥作用
    沈阳许多工厂产品质量迅速提高
    本报讯　沈阳市重工、机械、轻工等系统中许多党的基层组织——支部，在优良产品竞赛中发挥了堡垒作用。
    优良产品竞赛从今年4月开展以来，许多支部注意了调查分析出现废品的原因；也注意了改进宣传工作。沈阳扇风机厂加工车间在优良产品竞赛开展之前废品率达1.29％，超过国家规定指标0.29％。这个车间生产工人中经常出废品的就占50％以上。经过了解，除了部分工人因技术水平低而出废品外，不少工人存在着“完成计划是好汉，出点废品不算啥”的思想。有人说：“废几个活多超额点就有了！”支部根据这些反映，全面总结了过去宣传工作中的缺点，注意宣传全面完成计划的思想，在车间举办的先进生产者学习班中，着重介绍了先进生产者王尊贵保证产品质量超额完成任务的先进思想。同时，支部考虑到过去在宣传产品质量上常采用的“废品展览台”，影响工人的自尊心，很少有工人去看，于是将“废品展览台”改为“优良产品展览台”。在优良产品展览台前，组织检查或技术人员进行讲解，说明优良品是怎么产生的，使工人听了后，不仅懂得了什么是优良品，也知道了怎样才能生产出优良品。由于工人们认识了提高产品质量的重要意义，到9月末，全车间的废品率已降低到0.53％，保持在国家规定的指标以下。
    在优良产品竞赛中，许多支部也注意总结和推广提高产品质量的先进经验。沈阳低压开关厂工具车间支部，今年6月份总结了青年工人朱俊瑶两年没出废品的经验，并组织全车间普遍学习，到8月末，已出现二百二十八套优良模具。
    党支部的堡垒作用表现在党员用模范行动保证执行支部作出的决议。沈阳扇风机厂加工车间支部的共产党员，为了提高产品质量，都制定了自己和帮助群众的保证计划。到9月末，全车间绝大部分党员都消灭了废品。过去经常出废品的工人在党员的帮助下，也消灭了废品。
