Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, 28th: The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory now uses more than half a ton less metal material for each boxcar or tank car produced compared to the original amount.

The boxcars and tank cars manufactured by this factory originally had a very long extension at both ends of the underframe according to the original design. Later, after careful calculation, it was determined that such a long extension was not necessary. Therefore, the designers appropriately shortened it as needed, and reduced some unnecessary roof beams, side posts and other accessories.

    一辆货车节约半吨钢材
    据新华社旅大28日电　大连机车车辆制造工厂每生产一辆棚车或油槽车，比原来少用半吨多金属材料。
    这个厂制造的棚车和油槽车，按照原设计，车底架两端要伸出很长一段。后来经过周密地计算，认为并不需要那样长。因此，设计师们把它按需要适当缩短了，并且减去了一些不必要的棚梁、侧柱等附件。
