Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th -- Hong Kong dispatch: A climate of terror still enveloped the entire Kowloon area today. Although the acting Governor of British Hong Kong, David, announced yesterday that the British Hong Kong government was determined to suppress the riots and would take any necessary measures to ensure this, the riots have not subsided and the situation remains very chaotic. Martial law continued in the Kowloon area today.

Kuomintang special agents and rioters have expanded their scope of activities and changed their methods. Where the British military and police forces are strong, they break up into smaller groups; where the British military and police are fewer, they still act in groups and do as they please. Between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM today, more than 140 people gathered near the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency, many of whom were Kuomintang special agents, and they engaged in provocative activities. At 12:30 PM, more than a dozen British police officers divided into two small teams and went to the front of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch, releasing more than ten tear gas canisters to disperse the crowd. After being dispersed, the special agents ambushed themselves in nearby buildings, and came out again after the British police left. At the same time, it was also discovered that Kuomintang special agents were photographing the address of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch, which indicates that they may be preparing new actions.

Since last night, the scope of the riots has expanded from Sham Shui Po to areas such as Tsuen Wan in the New Territories, where factories are concentrated. The arsonist terrorist activities carried out by Kuomintang special agents and hooligans in Tsuen Wan continued until 4:00 AM today. Several large-scale yarn factories, sauce workshops, and other factories in Tsuen Wan and the nearby Sham Tseng area were set on fire. Kuomintang special agents also instigated rioters to destroy the Tsuen Wan Workers' Medical Clinic. In Tung Tau and Sai Tau villages in Kowloon City, many cloth factories and residential houses were looted by Kuomintang special agents who gathered rioters early this morning.

Gunfire was heard on several prosperous streets in Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei in Kowloon from evening to late at night. On that section of Nathan Road near Jordan Road, more than a dozen people were shot and fell to the streets. The area around Castle Peak Road and Tai Po Road became quiet late at night. Countless factories in the entire Kowloon area were burned and looted. Prosperous streets were closed during the day.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th -- Hong Kong dispatch at 8:00 PM: The riots launched by Kuomintang special agents in Kowloon two days ago are still developing today, and Hong Kong Island is facing a new threat of riots tonight.

In Kowloon, Kuomintang special agents and a large number of rioters attacked Heung To Middle School again at 1:00 PM this afternoon and set it on fire. The rioters dispersed only after the British military and police arrived. The fire was extinguished after rescue by the district fire brigade.

Due to the martial law imposed by the British military and police, the methods of the rioters directed by the Kuomintang special agents have changed. They break up into smaller groups in areas where British military and police are concentrated, attempting to carry out long-term sabotage activities, while launching surprise disturbances in areas where British military and police forces are weak. Today, Kuomintang special agents in the Kowloon City area are still knocking on doors, forcing people to buy and post Kuomintang flags; and extorting "protection fees" from many shops, ranging from about 100 to 5,000 Hong Kong dollars per shop. Special agents travel frequently in vehicles and bicycles with Kuomintang flags.

Kuomintang special agents have threatened to take action in Hong Kong tonight, preparing to attack Da Qian Printing Company, which prints the "Weekend" newspaper, the Commercial Press factory, Yong Fa Printing Company, as well as Pui Kiu Middle School and Han Hua Middle School in the North Point area. They also threatened to destroy the Ta Kung Pao newspaper office on Connaught Road and the Wen Wei Po newspaper office on Percival Street. Sources say that more than 1,000 rioters will cross the sea from Kowloon to Hong Kong to participate in the action tonight. From 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM, three wooden boats docked about ten meters away from the Wen Wei Po newspaper office, each carrying more than ten people, all wearing Kuomintang badges. After landing, they wandered around near the Wen Wei Po newspaper office. Wen Wei Po has notified the British police station of this serious situation. At the same time, many people from Macau took cargo ships to Hong Kong, landing separately in areas such as Sai Wan in Hong Kong.

Today, social order in Hong Kong and Kowloon is very chaotic. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange closed early at 10:00 AM, and various major food and daily necessities have risen in price one after another. A buying spree has formed in Kowloon, and the price increase is even greater. Many shops are unwilling to open for business within two hours of opening, many housewives cannot buy rice, and several areas have temporarily run out of food. Residents are trapped indoors all day except for the two-hour period of de-escalation when they can go out to shop. The Hong Kong authorities have announced that the curfew will be extended indefinitely.

Xinhua News Agency, 12th -- Hong Kong dispatch: Kuomintang special agents and a large number of rioters who created disturbances in Kowloon attacked Wheelock Marden, Nan Hai, and other large yarn factories in Tsuen Wan this afternoon. At 1:00 PM, the riots in Tsuen Wan caused most of the factories to close, and the streets were in chaos. From 2:00 PM, the situation in this area became more serious, and the rioters acted lawlessly, killing and setting fires at will. As many as sixty corpses and dying wounded were carried out of Tsuen Wan, including even children.

According to eyewitnesses, Tsuen Wan has become a world of terror today. Many women and children are fleeing with their families. There are many corpses left on the roads in this area.

At around 3:00 PM, nearly 3,000 outside rioters gathered in Tsuen Wan one after another. Their costumes were generally the same: white shoes, shorts, and white shirts, holding white cloth in their hands. After these rioters arrived in Tsuen Wan, they first attacked Po Sing Textile Mill, burning a car parked in front of the door. At the same time, some people set fire to the factory. Soon, these rioters turned to Tung Fong Soy Sauce Factory and set it on fire. Before this large-scale attack, Tsuen Wan had not been declared under martial law, so the rioters did as they pleased. However, after the attack, the British side announced "temporary martial law".

    九龙地区的骚乱仍在继续发展
    国民党特务分子扩大了骚动范围，被焚掠的工厂不计其数
    新华社广州12日电　香港消息：恐怖气氛今天仍笼罩着整个九龙地区。尽管英国香港代理总督戴维昨天宣布，英国香港政府决心弹压骚乱，并将采取任何必要措施保证做到这一点，但骚乱并没有平息，情况仍十分混乱。今日白天，九龙地区继续戒严。
    国民党特务分子和暴徒们扩大了活动范围并改变了活动方式。他们在英国军警力量较强的地方，就化整为零，进行活动；在英国军警比较少的地方，仍成群结队，为所欲为。今日上午十时到十二时之间，新华社香港分社附近陆续聚集了一百四十多人，其中有不少是国民党特务分子，他们进行挑衅性的活动。十二时半，英国警察十余人分成两小队开到新华社香港分社门前，施放了十多个催泪弹，驱散了聚集的人群。其中的特务分子被驱散后埋伏在附近的建筑物中，英国警察离开后，他们又出来活动。同时，还发现有国民党特务分子拍摄新华社香港分社的社址，这说明他们有可能准备新的行动。
    从昨夜起，骚动范围已由深水埗扩展到了新界的荃湾等地区。那里是工厂集中的地方。国民党特务分子和流氓在荃湾进行的纵火恐怖活动，到今日凌晨四点钟还在继续中。荃湾及附近深井地区有好几家规模较大的纱厂、酱料作坊及其他工厂被纵火。国民党特务分子并指使暴徒把荃湾工人医疗所拆毁。在九龙城的东头及西头两村，今日凌晨有许多布厂及居民住所被国民党特务纠合暴徒劫掠。
    九龙旺角及油麻地的几条繁盛的街道上，从傍晚到深夜都有枪声。在弥敦道近佐敦道的那一段，有十几人被枪弹击中，倒在街头。青山道及大埔道一带，深夜趋沉寂。整个九龙地区被焚被掠的工厂不计其数。繁盛的街道在白天也关门闭户。
    新华社广州12日电　香港下午八时消息：国民党特务分子两天前在九龙发动的骚动今日仍在继续发展，而香港岛方面今晚又面临新的骚动的威胁。
    在九龙的国民党特务分子和大批暴徒在今天下午一时再度攻击香岛中学，并纵火焚烧。直到英国军警赶来，暴徒们才散去。经区消防队抢救，火势才告息灭。
    由于英方军警实施戒严，国民党特务分子指挥的暴徒们的活动方式已有变化，他们在英方军警结集的地区化整为零，企图长期进行破坏活动，而在英国军警力量薄弱的地方则作突击性的捣乱。今天在九龙城一带国民党特务分子仍挨户敲门，强迫群众购买和张贴国民党旗帜；并向许多商店勒索“保护费”，每家约一百元至五千元。特务分子乘着挂着国民党旗帜的车辆和自行车往来频繁。
    国民党特务分子扬言今晚将在香港有所行动，准备袭击北角区的承印“周末”报的大千印刷公司、商务印书馆工厂、永发印务公司以及培侨中学、汉华中学。他们还扬言要捣毁在干诺道的大公报社和波斯富街的文汇报社。有消息说，今晚有一千多名暴徒将从九龙方面渡海到香港参加行动。下午五时到六时，有木船三只在距离文汇报社十多公尺处靠岸，每只船载十余人，都佩戴有国民党徽章。他们上岸后，即在文汇报社附近徘徊。文汇报已将此严重情况通知了英方警署。同时，澳门方面有很多人坐货船到香港，分头在香港西环等处登陆。
    今日香港和九龙的社会秩序十分混乱。香港证券交易所提前在上午十时收盘，各种主要食粮和日用品都相继上涨。九龙方面已形成抢购风潮，物价上涨的幅度更大，许多商店在开放两小时内，不肯开门营业，有许多家庭主妇买不到白米，若干地区曾一度断粮。居民们除了在两小时的解禁期间可以外出购物外，全天都被困在屋内。香港当局已宣布宵禁将无限期延长。
    新华社12日讯　香港消息：在九龙制造骚动的国民党特务分子和大批暴徒，今天下午袭击了荃湾的会德丰、南海等大户纱厂。在下午一时，荃湾的暴乱，使工厂大部分关门，街上一片混乱。从下午二时开始，这个地区的情况更加严重，暴徒们无法无天，任意杀人放火。从荃湾抬出来的尸体和奄奄一息的伤者，有六十人之多，其中甚至有小孩。
    据目击者谈，今天荃湾已成恐怖世界。不少妇孺拖男带女逃难。在这一带路上有遗尸不少。
    在下午三时左右，有外来的暴徒近三千人先后在荃湾集合。他们装束大致相同，白鞋、短裤、白衬衫，手拿白布。这些暴徒到达荃湾后先袭击宝星纱厂，将停在门前的一辆汽车烧毁。同时，又有一部分人纵火焚烧工厂。不久这些暴徒又转向东方酱油厂纵火。在这次大规模袭击之前，荃湾并未宣布戒严，因此暴徒们为所欲为。然在袭击过后，英方才宣布“临时戒严”。
