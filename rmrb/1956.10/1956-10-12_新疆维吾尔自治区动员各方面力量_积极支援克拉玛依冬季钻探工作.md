Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, October 10th (Xinhua News Agency Reporter Han Wenhui): The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is actively supporting the winter drilling operations of the Karamay Oilfield.

The autonomous region's transportation departments and the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have recently dispatched 785 vehicles to transport the main equipment used this winter for the Karamay mining area. The Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Posts and Telecommunications Administration have also recently allocated six radio telephones to help Karamay overcome communication difficulties after the expansion of the drilling scale. The autonomous region's trade company has transported more than ten tons of winter leather clothing, cotton clothing, and wool clothing to Karamay workers, and more than thirty tons of winter supplies are being shipped successively.

Since the large-scale drilling of the Karamay Oilfield began, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has tried in every possible way to provide strong support. From the beginning of May to September 15 this year, the autonomous region government successively transferred nearly a thousand vehicles from transportation departments and twenty-five district-level organizations to support Karamay. Over the past four months, the drivers of these vehicles have traveled long distances on the hot and bumpy Gobi Desert, overcoming various difficulties and transporting more than 28,000 tons of equipment for Karamay. Among them, 167 vehicles were public vehicles mobilized by the autonomous region from district-level organizations during the period of tight transportation in Karamay. From the first half of this year to now, the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region has also successively dispatched more than 6,000 people to support various basic construction projects in Karamay. Currently, these personnel are still in Karamay rushing to repair winter residences for employees and oilfield roads, water pipelines, and other projects.

    新疆维吾尔自治区动员各方面力量
    积极支援克拉玛依冬季钻探工作
    新华社乌鲁木齐10日电　新华社记者韩文慧报道：新疆维吾尔自治区积极支援克拉玛依油田的冬季钻探工作。
    自治区运输部门和中国人民解放军新疆军区生产建设部队，在最近已经抽调出七百八十五辆汽车，为克拉玛依矿区运输今冬所用的主要器材。新疆军区生产建设部队和新疆维吾尔自治区邮电管理局，最近还调拨了六部报话机，帮助克拉玛依克服在钻探规模扩大后通讯联络上的困难。自治区贸易公司已经为克拉玛依职工运去十多吨过冬的皮衣、棉衣、绒衣等用品，还有三十多吨过冬用品，正在陆续运送中。
    克拉玛依油田大规模钻探展开以后，新疆维吾尔自治区便多方设法，大力进行支援。从今年5月初到9月15日为止，自治区政府从运输部门和二十五个区级机关中，陆续抽调了近千辆汽车支援克拉玛依。这些车辆的驾驶人员在过去四个月内，长期奔波在气候炎热、道路坎坷不平的戈壁上，克服了种种困难，共为克拉玛依运送了两万八千多吨器材；其中有一百六十七辆汽车，是自治区在克拉玛依运输紧张期间从区级机关中动员出来的公用汽车。新疆军区生产建设部队从今年上半年到现在，也陆续抽调了六千多人支援克拉玛依的各项基本建设工程。现在，这些人员仍在克拉玛依赶修职工过冬住宅和油区的公路、输水管路等工程。
