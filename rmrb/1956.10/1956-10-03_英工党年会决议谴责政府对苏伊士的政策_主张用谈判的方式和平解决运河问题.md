Xinhua News Agency, Blackpool, October 2nd. According to TASS, the 55th annual conference of the British Labour Party opened in Blackpool on October 1st. The conference was attended by 1,034 delegates, representing approximately 6.5 million Labour Party members.

Submitted to the delegates for discussion were the Labour Party Executive Committee's summary report and the Labour Party Parliamentary Group's report. In addition, the conference will discuss four policy documents proposed by the Executive Committee, concerning: colonial issues, housing issues, and the programs of "personal freedom" and "social justice". Four hundred and eighteen proposals and one hundred and fifteen amendments from local party organizations on domestic and foreign affairs will also be submitted to the conference for discussion.

Many local organizations' proposals advocate that the Labour Party's activities, whether in domestic or foreign affairs, should be faithful to the principles of socialism. Most of the proposals on international issues support: peaceful coexistence between countries with different political systems, and the establishment of a collective security system.

Some proposals point out that the struggle to maintain peace requires the unity of all peace-loving forces. Therefore, some local organizations advocate that the Labour Party take concerted action with all progressive groups and demand the abolition of the current regulations for Labour Party members that prohibit participation in the work of certain groups, such as the British-Soviet Friendship Association.

At the first day's session, the annual conference adopted a special resolution on the Suez Canal issue, condemning the government's "regrettable policy in the Suez crisis" and endorsing the Labour Party Parliamentary Group's position on this issue. The special resolution "reaffirms that British policy should be in accordance with the United Nations Charter and should be committed to resolving the issue peacefully through negotiation."

Jenkins, a representative of the London City Party organization, pointed out when submitting this resolution that his initial draft resolution demanded unconditional recognition of Egypt's right to nationalize the Suez Canal Company. However, the organizing committee of the meeting made some modifications when it was published, weakening certain wording.

The movement launched by many Labour Party local organizations against the adoption of a "policy of strength" on the Suez Canal issue has had an important impact on the attitude of the delegates attending the annual conference. All the delegates who spoke on this proposal firmly condemned the adoption of a "policy of strength" on the Suez issue and demanded a peaceful solution to the issue.

Labour MP Hynd believed that the wording of the proposal should be strengthened. He said that Labour Party members should resolutely oppose the use of a "policy of strength" as a means of resolving international disputes. He called on the delegates to launch a broader struggle in various places to force the government to abandon its intention to use force against Egypt.

Grete, a representative of the West Suffolk Labour Party organization, asked the delegates to protest against the economic pressure exerted on Egypt. She expressed her firm belief that Egypt is fully capable of ensuring the normal operation of the canal and freedom of navigation.

However, some people at the meeting arbitrarily said that the Egyptian government's actions were arbitrary in nature, in an attempt to divert the delegates' attention. For example, MP Hughes did so. However, he also advocated a peaceful solution to the Suez Canal issue.

Edwin Gooch, Chairman of the Labour Party National Executive Committee, said that the government on the Suez Canal issue "even pushed us to the brink of war and created a situation in which we were called aggressors by others."

He said: "What shocked us the most is that the British government in the middle of the twentieth century still wants to use force to resolve disputes and achieve its own goals. Suez is the most recent of our many failures, and these failures have discredited our entire policy in the Middle East."

Gooch also accused the position of some British officials as unhelpful to the resolution of disarmament issues and the German question, as well as to accepting suggestions regarding peaceful competition between countries with different social systems, which he called "a new challenge from communism." Gooch said that the British ruling group's position on other international issues was "insincere, very weak and even disruptive," including "supporting the United Nations and its agencies, and the issue of granting Communist China a seat in the United Nations."

Labour leader Gaitskell said in summing up the debate that "he cannot completely agree with the Egyptian government's actions", but also sees no correctness in attempting to use force against Egypt. Gaitskell once again pointed out that negotiation is the only way to resolve the Suez Canal issue. He accused the government of being unwilling to clearly announce to the world that it would not use force against Egypt.

When the resolution was put to a vote, only one delegate opposed it. The discussion and voting situation proved that the Labour Party unanimously condemned the policy of escalating tensions on the Suez Canal issue.

### 英工党年会决议谴责政府对苏伊士的政策  主张用谈判的方式和平解决运河问题

    英工党年会决议谴责政府对苏伊士的政策
    主张用谈判的方式和平解决运河问题
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社布莱克浦1日讯：英国工党第五十五届年会10月1日在布莱克浦开幕。出席会议的有一千零三十四名代表，他们代表着工党的约六百五十万党员。
    提交代表讨论的有工党执行委员会的总结报告和工党议会党团的报告。此外会上还要讨论执行委员会提出的四个政策文件，这四个文件的内容是：殖民地问题、住宅问题以及“人身自由”问题和“社会正义”问题的纲领。各地党组织提出了四百一十八项关于内政和外交问题的提案和一百一十五项修正案，也将交由大会讨论。
    许多地方组织的提案主张，工党无论是在内政方面或外交方面的活动都应该忠于社会主义的原则。大多数关于国际问题的提案中都赞成：政治制度不同的国家和平共处，建立集体安全体系。
    有些提案指出，要进行维护和平的斗争，就要求一切爱好和平的力量团结起来。因此，一部分地方组织主张工党同一切进步团体采取一致行动，并且要求取消现在对工党党员实行的、禁止参加某些团体、如英苏友好协会的工作的条例。
    年会第一天会议上通过了一项关于苏伊士运河问题的特别决议，谴责政府“在苏伊士危机中令人遗憾的政策”，并且赞同工党议会党团在这个问题上的立场。特别决议“重申英国的政策应当符合联合国宪章，应当致力于用谈判的方式和平解决问题。”
    伦敦市党组织的代表詹金斯在提出这项决议的时候指出，他提出的初步决议案要求无条件地承认埃及把苏伊士运河公司收归国有的权利。但是，会议的组织委员在发表时作了一些修改，削弱了某些措词。
    许多工党地方组织所展开的反对在苏伊士运河问题上采用“实力政策”的运动，对出席年会的代表的态度有着重要影响。所有就这个提案发言的代表都坚决谴责在苏伊士问题上采用“实力政策”，要求和平解决问题。
    工党议员海恩德认为，应当把提案的措词加强。他说，工党党员应当坚决反对用“实力政策”作为解决国际争端的手段。他号召代表在各地更加广泛地展开斗争，迫使政府放弃对埃及采用实力的打算。
    西萨福德工党组织代表格雷特要求代表们抗议对埃及施加经济压力。她表示深信埃及完全有能力保证运河的正常工作和通航自由。
    但是，在会上也有人凭空武断地说埃及政府的行动带有专横的性质，想以此来转移代表们的视线。例如，议员休斯就是这样。但是，他也主张用和平办法解决苏伊士运河问题。
    工党全国执行委员会主席埃德温·古奇说，政府在苏伊士运河问题上“甚至把我们推向战争边缘，并且造成了我们被别人骂做侵略者的局面”。
    他说：“最使我们感到震惊的是，英国政府在二十世纪的中叶竟还想使用武力来解决纠纷，来达到自己的目的。苏伊士，这是我们许多失败中的最近一次失败，这些失败使我们在中东的全部政策丧失了信誉。”
    古奇还指责英国一些官方人士的立场无助于裁军问题和德国问题的解决，也无助于接受关于社会制度不同国家和平竞赛的建议，他称这个建议为“共产主义的新挑战”。古奇说，英国统治集团在其他一些国际问题上的立场是“不真诚的、十分软弱的甚至是捣乱的”，这些问题包括“支持联合国和联合国的各机构以及关于给予共产党中国以联合国席位的问题”。
    工党领袖盖次克尔在总结辩论时说，“他不能完全同意埃及政府的行动”，但是，也看不出企图对埃及使用武力有什么正确的地方。盖次克尔再一次指出，谈判是解决苏伊士运河问题的唯一办法。他指责政府不愿意明白向全世界宣布它不对埃及使用武力。
    在就这个决议进行表决时，只有一个代表反对。讨论和表决的情形证明，工党一致指责在苏伊士运河问题上实行箭拔弩张的政策。
