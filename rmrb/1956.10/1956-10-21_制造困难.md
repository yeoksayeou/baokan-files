    Creating Difficulties
    After reading the "Within the Border, Economic Blockade is Not Allowed" letters column on the third page of the People's Daily on October 3rd, I couldn't help but be moved. According to my understanding: Camphorwood chests produced in Wenzhou are not sold to outside consumers; camphorwood chests in Tiantai County can only be bought as unfinished semi-finished products by consumers; the Ningbo Special District Timber Company is not allowed to sell timber the size of a fist to other places. A crab boat in Daishan County broke a mast and an oar in August, and although Ningbo had these goods, they were not allowed to buy them. Similar situations are too numerous to mention. This approach is obviously not beneficial to the country and the people, but these people, I don't know why, just want to blockade each other and create difficulties.

    制造困难
    读了人民日报十月三日第三版“国境之内，不许经济封锁”的来信专栏以后，不禁令人有动于衷。据我了解：温州出产的樟木箱，不卖给外来的消费者；天台县的樟木箱，消费者要买只能买未装成箱的半成品；宁波专区木材公司拳头大的木材也不准出售到外地去。岱山县的一只捕蟹船8月份断了一杆桅和一只橹手，宁波有这种货，却不让他们买。类似情形，举不胜举。这种做法，对国家和人民显然是没有好处的，可是这些人，不知为什么就是要相互封锁，制造困难。
