    ☆Agricultural Machine Stations in Autumn Operations☆
    Agricultural Machine Stations in Hebei Disaster Areas Help Farmers Plant Wheat
    Thirty-five agricultural machine stations in disaster areas of Hebei Province, such as Jize and Qiuxian, are actively helping farmers with autumn plowing and wheat planting. As of the 10th, they had completed a total of 792,900 mu of land in plowing, harrowing, compacting, and sowing. Stations in the south and central regions, such as Linzhang, Nangong, Xingtai, Luancheng, Mancheng, Dingxian, and Jinxian, have completed or are about to complete their autumn plowing tasks.
    These thirty-five agricultural machine stations were deployed in early September, based on the receding floodwaters in the disaster areas and the production needs of agricultural producers' cooperatives, to support farmers in autumn plowing and planting.
    Jilin "August 1st" Station Helps Agricultural Cooperatives with Autumn Plowing
    The newly built "August 1st" Agricultural Machine Station in Jilin Province is helping nearby agricultural cooperatives with autumn plowing. Tractor drivers, many still in their army uniforms after demobilization, are preparing to complete 1,280 hectares of autumn plowing before the ground freezes.
    This agricultural machine station was built with donations from officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in support of agricultural cooperation. The station has fifty tractors, of which ten have arrived. The drivers were originally car drivers and tank crewmen in the army. After a short period of training, they quickly mastered the driving skills of tractors.
    Newly Built Agricultural Machine Station in Yunnan Starts Tilling Autumn Land
    The first agricultural machine station in the Yunnan Plateau—the state-owned Kunming Agricultural Machine Station—began plowing land for agricultural cooperatives in mid-October.
    This agricultural machine station is located in the eastern suburbs of Kunming City and has six 25- to 35-horsepower tractors and various agricultural implements such as disc harrows and seeders. In the past week or so, the station has cultivated more than 400 mu of farmland for the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative. This station plans to cultivate more than 5,000 mu of farmland for nearby agricultural cooperatives this autumn.
    A Group of Farmer-Tractor Drivers from Western Sichuan
    Participated in This Year's Autumn Plowing
    When a red "Ket" tractor drove to the entrance of the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Hexing Township, Pixian County, Sichuan Province, the cooperative members surrounded the tractor, welcoming the farmer-tractor driver Huang Yingzhong, who had returned to his cooperative to help with the plowing.
    Huang Yingzhong was an ordinary farmer in the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative two years ago, and now he has become the captain in charge of this tractor.
    The Pixian Agricultural Machine Station in the Western Sichuan Plain has trained more than eighty farmer-tractor drivers and implement operators in the past two years. More than sixty of them have participated in this year's autumn plowing. Among these sixty-odd tractor drivers, eight have been promoted to captain and deputy captain of the tractor team.
    Yan'an Farmers Watch Tractors Plowing the Land
    The Yan'an Agricultural Machine Station, donated to the people of Yan'an by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, has begun helping farmers plow their land in nearby villages. When the plowshare attached to the tractor cut through the ground and the soil on both sides rolled like waves, the watching farmers laughed and shouted in the roar of the engine, many excitedly running after the tractor.
    The Yan'an Agricultural Machine Station can cultivate more than 100,000 mu of land. While establishing the station, it first signed contracts with more than forty agricultural cooperatives, preparing to cultivate more than 15,000 mu this autumn.

    ☆秋季作业中的农业机器站☆
    河北灾区农业机器站帮助农民种麦
    河北省灾区鸡泽、丘县等三十五个农业机器站，积极帮助灾民秋耕种麦。到10日为止，已完成耕地、耙地、镇压和播种等共七十九万二千九百亩。南部和中部的临漳、南宫、邢台、栾城、满城、定县、晋县等站已完成或将完成秋耕任务。
    这三十五个农业机器站，是在9月初根据灾区积水退出情况和农业生产合作社的生产需要，支援灾区农民秋耕秋种的。
    吉林“八一”站给农业社秋耕
    吉林省新建的“八一”农业机器站，正在给附近农业社进行秋耕。复员不久还穿着军装的拖拉机手们，准备在土地上冻以前，完成一千二百八十公顷秋翻地任务。
    这个农业机器站是用中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军官兵们支援农业合作化的捐献款建设成的。站内有拖拉机五十台，目前已到站十台。驾驶员们原来都是部队的汽车司机和坦克手，他们经过短期训练，迅速掌握了拖拉机的驾驶技术。
    云南新建农业机器站开始代耕秋地
    出现在云南高原上的第一座农业机器站——国营昆明农业机器站，已于10月中旬开始为农业社耕地。
    这个农业机器站建立在昆明市东郊，拥有六台二十五匹至三十五匹马力的拖拉机和圆盘耙、播种机等各种农具。最近一周多来，这个站已为先锋农业社代耕了四百多亩田地。这个站在今年秋耕中，计划给附近的农业社代耕田地五千多亩。川西一批农民拖拉机手
    参加了今年的秋耕
    当一台红色的“克特”拖拉机，开到四川省郫县合兴乡红光农业社的门口的时候，社员们紧围在这台拖拉机的跟前，欢迎驾驶拖拉机回到自己社里代耕的农民拖拉机手黄应忠。
    黄应忠在两年前还是红光农业社的一个普通农民，现在他已经成为掌管这台拖拉机的车长了。
    川西平原上的郫县农业机器站，最近两年来已经培养了八十多名农民拖拉机手和农具手。其中已经有六十多人参加了今年的秋耕，这六十多个拖拉机手中间，已有八人被提升为车长和拖拉机队的副队长。
    延安农民看拖拉机耕地
    中国人民解放军赠给延安人民的延安农业机器站，已开始在延安附近村子帮助农民耕地。当拖拉机带的犁头切破地面，两旁泥土像波浪一样翻滚起来的时候，围观的农民在隆隆的马达声中喧笑嚷嚷，许多人激动地跟着拖拉机跑来跑去。
    延安农业机器站共可代耕土地十万多亩。这个站在建站的同时，首先和四十多个农业社签订合同，准备在今秋先代耕一万五千多亩。
