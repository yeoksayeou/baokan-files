    On the Stage Image of Sun Wukong
    Shao Ruo
    In my understanding, Sun Wukong is a monkey who has attained enlightenment, not an "ordinary product" from the monkey mountain in a zoo. He should possess a considerable amount of "immortal aura." However, he is, after all, a monkey and not a human, so besides the "immortal aura," he should also have a certain degree of "wildness." Furthermore, he is a fellow with "chivalrous spirit," possessing all the good qualities of humans such as "doing what is right" and "drawing a sword to help when seeing injustice." At the same time, although he is witty and agile, he is innocent and unpretentious, unaccustomed to affectation, so he also has a kind of open and straightforward "righteousness." Sun Wukong is portrayed this way in Wu Cheng'en's writing, and the Monkey King performed on stage should also be like this. The most important point is that Sun Wukong's words and deeds have always been imitating humans; moreover, because he has transcended the mortal and entered the sacred, his achievement in imitating humans should only be "a hair's breadth away" from real humans—this is also what the Sun Wukong on stage must embody.
    I don't want to "indulge in nostalgic sentiments," but I really can't forget the image of Sun Wukong played by Yang Xiaolou; secondly, the "An Tian Hui" of the Kunqu and Yiyang Opera veteran Hao Zhenji is still vividly in my mind. The reason why Yang Xiaolou's monkey opera became a unique skill, in my understanding, is: first, the magnificent "immortal aura" and the clumsy "wildness" are unified in him, and the "immortal aura" occupies the primary position; second, the innocent character and the open and straightforward demeanor are expressed extremely profoundly and prominently, yet simply and concisely; third, his every move embodies the interest of a monkey imitating humans, and is by no means a human learning from a monkey. This creates the image of Sun Wukong in a exemplary way. Hao Zhenji's monkey opera, at the time, was already considered by most veteran opera connoisseurs to be too much like a real, ordinary monkey rather than an enlightened Sun Wukong, but his performance of resembling a real monkey was still measured, that is, only when Sun Wukong was carried away by his own success, such as in the scenes of stealing peaches and pills, did he reveal his "monkey" form completely. This precisely illustrates that Sun Wukong usually pretends to be human, and only when he forgets himself does he reveal his true colors as a monkey. Therefore, I believe his performance is still realistic.
    Today's stage image of Sun Wukong, in the majority of cases, takes the monkeys on the monkey mountain in the zoo as a blueprint, reversing the imitation of humans by monkeys into humans learning from monkeys. From the moment he appears on stage, he scratches and fidgets all over, as a friend put it, making Sun Wukong appear so unhygienic, as if he is covered in fleas. Some blindly pursue clumsy movements with a vulgar atmosphere, even turning their hands and feet into a state of spasm, but forget that Sun Wukong is already the "Great Sage Equal to Heaven." Some have a fierce look on their faces, or stubbornly make trouble for no reason, mistaking unreasonable entanglements for innocence. Some even replace the straightforward and open-minded demeanor with a frivolous, conceited style. The result is that everywhere you see that they are pretending to be a monkey, and the loveliness of Sun Wukong is not embodied at all. However, this has almost become the goal of today's stage portrayal of Sun Wukong, which I don't think is good.
    The trend of humans imitating monkeys is not only limited to the performance of Sun Wukong. Just look at the "Fifteen Strings of Cash" performed by various troupes in Beijing and Tianjin in recent months. How many of the performers playing Lou Ashu do not have the spirit and gestures of a monkey?

    关于孙悟空的舞台形象
    少若
    照我的体会是，孙悟空是一个已经得道的猴子，而非动物园中猴山上的“凡品”，在他身上应带有相当浓厚的“仙气”；但他毕竟是猴子而不是人，所以在“仙气”之外还有一定程度的“野趣”。再有，他是个具有“侠气”的家伙，像人类所有的“见义勇为”、“路见不平，拔刀相助”的好品质他也是具备的。同时，他虽机智灵巧，但天真无邪，不惯矫揉造作，所以他还有一种开朗爽直的“正气”。在吴承恩笔下塑造的孙悟空是这样，在舞台上演出的孙猴儿也应该是这样。而最主要的一点乃是：孙悟空的言行举止一直是在摹仿人类的；更因为他已超凡入圣，所以他摹仿人类的造诣应该同真的人类只是“相去一间”——这又是舞台上的孙悟空所必须体现的。
    我不想“发思古之幽情”，但我确实不能忘怀于杨小楼所扮演的孙悟空的形象；其次，昆弋前辈郝振基的“安天会”也宛然存于耳目之间。杨小楼的猴戏所以成为一绝，照我的体会是：一、大气磅礴的“仙气”和毛手毛脚的“野趣”统一在他的身上，而“仙气”更占首要地位；二、天真无邪的性格和开朗爽直的气度表现得极其深刻突出而又简单扼要；三、举手投足体现了猴子摹仿人的情趣而绝非人在学猢狲。这就典范地创造了孙悟空的形象。郝振基的猴戏，当时一般老顾曲家已觉得太像凡品的真猴子而不是得道的孙悟空，但其像真猴的表演仍是有分寸的，即每当孙悟空得意忘形时，如偷桃盗丹的场面，他才“猴”形毕露，这正好说明平时孙悟空是装着人相的，一旦忘其所以，才露了马脚，把猴子的本色摆出来了。所以我认为他的表演也还是现实主义的。
    今天舞台上孙悟空的形象，十之八九是以动物园猴山上的猴子为蓝本的，把猴子摹仿人一反而为人学猢狲，一出场就浑身乱抓乱挠，正如一位朋友所谈，显得孙悟空是如此的不卫生，好像长了一身跳蚤。有的则一味追求带有庸俗气氛的毛手毛脚，甚至把手足都演成痉挛状态，却忘记了孙悟空已经是“齐天大圣”。有的满脸凶气，或是一劲儿无理取闹，把歪搅蛮缠当成了天真无邪。有的更把浮躁的自高自大作风代替了爽直开朗的气度。其结果是处处使人看出那是在装猴子，孙悟空的可爱处却丝毫不曾体现。然而这却几乎成为今天舞台上塑造孙悟空形象的奋斗目标，我看未必是好。
    人摹仿猴子的风气已经不仅于演孙悟空是如此了，试看几个月来京、津一带各个剧团演出的“十五贯”，有几个演娄阿鼠的不带有猴子的神气和身段呢？
