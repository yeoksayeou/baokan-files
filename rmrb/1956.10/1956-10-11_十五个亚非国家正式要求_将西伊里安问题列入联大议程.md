Xinhua News Agency, October 10th, New York Dispatch: Fifteen Asian-African countries in the United Nations formally requested on October 9th that the West Irian issue be included in the United Nations General Assembly agenda.

These countries also attached a memorandum when they made this request. The memorandum pointed out that the United Nations General Assembly unanimously passed a resolution in 1955 expressing the hope that negotiations regarding this dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands would "achieve results."

The memorandum then stated: "However, more than two months of lengthy negotiations have failed to produce the desired results." This failure has led to a deterioration in relations between Indonesia and the Netherlands. At the same time, the unresolved West Irian issue remains a malignant tumor in the relations between Indonesia and the Netherlands.

"We still believe that the United Nations has a responsibility and obligation to make further efforts to find a peaceful solution to this long-standing political dispute between the two member states. Such a peaceful solution will certainly be beneficial not only to improving relations between the two countries but also to the peace and security of the region involved.

"Under the guidance of this view, the aforementioned Asian-African governments believe that it is necessary to raise the West Irian issue to the General Assembly again for discussion and appropriate recommendations."

    十五个亚非国家正式要求
    将西伊里安问题列入联大议程
    据新华社10日讯　纽约消息：联合国中的十五个亚非国家10月9日正式要求把西伊里安问题列入联合国大会议程。
    这些国家在提出这个要求的时候还附了一份备忘录。备忘录指出，联合国大会在1955年曾经一致通过了一项决议，表示希望关于印度尼西亚和荷兰之间的这个争端的谈判将“获得成就”。
    备忘录接着说：“然而两个多月的漫长的谈判未能产生所期望的结果。”这种失败引起了印度尼西亚和荷兰之间的关系的恶化。同时，仍然没有解决的西伊里安问题继续是印度尼西亚和荷兰之间的关系中的一个癌肿。
    “我们还是认为，联合国有责任和义务来进一步努力寻找两个会员国之间这个长期悬而未决的政治争端的和平解决办法。这样一个和平解决办法不仅对改善两国之间的关系而且对所牵连到的地区的和平和安全都将肯定地有所助益。
    “在这个见解的指导下，上述亚—非政府认为有必要再度向大会提出西伊里安问题，以便加以讨论和提出适当的建议。”
