    Cherishing Leftover Food
    Not long ago, I traveled from Hankou to Shanghai on the Jiang’an轮 (Jiang’an ship), and I discovered that the ship's staff were not cherishing leftover food at all. This ship is very large and has two dining halls. Because there are many people, meals are served in five sittings, and hundreds of pounds of leftover food are generated every day. I fully expected them to make good use of it, but they kept throwing it into the river time and time again. I asked the staff on the ship why they didn't use it to raise pigs? Their reply was very simple: "There is no way to set up a pen." However, if we are to cherish materials, I think it is also possible to accumulate it and send it ashore to feed pigs. I hope that the shipping department will pay attention to this issue.

    爱惜剩菜剩饭
    不久以前，我从汉口乘江安轮到上海，发现船上的工作人员很不爱惜剩菜剩饭。这只轮船很大，设有两个食堂。因为人多，每餐要开五次，每天剩菜剩饭有几百斤。我满以为他们会很好地利用的，可是他们却一次一次地都丢到江里去了。我曾问过这个船上的工作人员，为什么不用它养猪？他们答复很简单，“没法设圈”。不过，如果是爱惜物资的话，我想，把它积存起来送到岸上喂猪也是可以的。我希望航运部门注意这一问题。
