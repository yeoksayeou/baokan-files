Xinhua News Agency, Yanji, 25th -- The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture Industry Bureau announced on the 23rd that, as of the end of September, the total output value of local state-owned, joint state-private, and cooperative-run enterprises in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture had exceeded the level that should have been reached in 1957 by an average of 1.90%, and was 178.68% of that in 1952.

During the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, many local industrial enterprises in the autonomous prefecture developed from scratch and from small to large. At present, Yanbian local industry has more than ninety enterprises including coal, building materials, forestry chemicals, agricultural tools, textiles, rubber, food, leather, and paper. Among them, the production of paddy field agricultural tools, rubber shoes, knitwear, paper, printing, and industrial food has been able to meet the daily needs of the people of all ethnic groups in Yanbian.

In recent years, factories in Yanbian have learned and promoted the advanced experience of the interior, and have increased new varieties to suit the needs of ethnic minorities. The various paddy field agricultural tools produced in Yanbian have low cost and good quality, and have been sold to more than ten provinces across the country.
