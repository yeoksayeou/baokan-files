    A Visit to Lu Xun's Former Residence in Shaoxing
    Yuan Shuipai
    I had never been to Shaoxing to visit Mr. Lu Xun's former residence, only repeatedly reading about it in Mr. Lu Xun's works and other people's articles. Just recently, this wish was fulfilled.
    The layout of streets and houses in Shaoxing is familiar to the people of Jiangnan: streets and rivers run side by side, with rows of houses along both. Almost every house along the river has a small stone or wooden bridge spanning the river, connecting it to the street. The three houses connected to Mr. Lu Xun's childhood life—Old Taitingmen, New Taitingmen, and Sanwei Study—belong to this type of layout.
    The first house is the old residence of the Zhou family, where Mr. Lu Xun's grandfather, Zhou Fuqing, a scholar of the Qing Dynasty, lived. Inside the gate still hangs the gilded plaque of a Hanlin scholar. It once served as a palace for the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and there are murals from that time on the walls. Later, as the Zhou family's population increased, they purchased another house, very close to the old residence. From then on, the clansmen called the old residence Old Taitingmen, and the new residence New Taitingmen. Taitingmen means mansion, which is what houses of scholar-officials were called in this area. There are also residences of other surnames between these two houses, which have now been purchased by the government and turned into the Lu Xun Memorial Hall. The memorial hall has been renovated neatly and displays cultural relics and materials. The architecture and furnishings maintain the style of the time and place, and there are several rooms available for visitors to stay.
    Mr. Lu Xun never lived in Old Taitingmen, but only went there with his peers to play and pick flowers and trees during sacrifices and celebrations. It is said that Mr. Lu Xun liked to look at the murals of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom at that time.
    New Taitingmen has a total of five courtyards. The room where Mr. Lu Xun was born has been preserved. Comrade Fang Jie, the curator of the memorial hall, pointed out to us the old objects in each room, such as Mr. Lu Xun's mother's bed, the books she read, the orchids planted by Mr. Lu Xun himself, as well as tables, chairs, boxes, and cabinets. Due to the age, many of these relics have been gradually collected from various places, and some have been identified and confirmed by relatives and friends. For example, in the old Mrs. Lu's room, there is a four-cornered table with drawers. When Mr. Lu Xun was the academic supervisor at Shaoxing Middle School, he often sat at this table to chat with the old lady when he returned from school. Some old people remember playing with the copper rings of the drawer handles when they were young, and they had a deep impression, so they are definitely relics of the Zhou family.
    Restoring the former residence to its appearance in those years is not an easy task. For decades, not to mention the furniture in the house has undergone great changes, even the structure of the house has changed repeatedly. It requires arranging and equipping it bit by bit based on the memories of many people. Curator Fang said that there are still dozens of people who are familiar with Mr. Lu Xun and the Zhou family in his childhood and adolescence, and it is necessary to collect relevant historical materials from them in a timely manner. The memorial hall once fitted the windows of old Mrs. Lu's bedroom with glass according to Mr. Zhou Jianren's memory. When Mr. Jianren came to see it again in person, he felt that the light was not so bright. Later, Mr. Jianren wrote a letter saying that he remembered that only the lower part of the window was embedded with glass, and the upper part was papered. Therefore, it needs to be refitted.

    记游绍兴鲁迅故家
    袁水拍
    从来没有去过绍兴，去瞻仰过鲁迅先生故家，只是在鲁迅先生的著作和别人的文章里一再地读到有关的记载。直到最近，这愿望才实现。
    绍兴的街道和房屋的格局，在江南人的心目中一点也不陌生，总是这样：街道和河流并列一起，沿街是一排房屋，沿河也是一排房屋。沿河的房屋差不多家家有座小石桥或者小木桥跨过河去，和街道接通。和鲁迅先生的童年生活联系在一起的三座房屋——老台门、新台门、三味书屋，便是属于这种格局的。
    第一座房屋是周家的老宅，是鲁迅先生的祖父、清翰林周福清住的，现在门内依旧挂着翰林的泥金匾额。这里曾经做过太平天国的行宫，墙上有当时的壁画。后来周家人口增多，购置了另一座房屋，距离老宅很近。从此，族人们把老宅叫做老台门，新宅叫做新台门。台门的意思是邸第，是这一带对士大夫家宅的称呼。这两座房屋之间还有别姓的住宅，现在已经由公家买来辟作鲁迅纪念馆。纪念馆修葺得很整洁，陈列着文物资料。建筑和陈设都保持着当时当地的风格，有几间楼房可供参观者住宿。
    鲁迅先生没有住过老台门，只是每逢祭祀喜庆，同同辈们一起到那边去游玩，采摘花木。据说鲁迅先生当时很喜欢看那些太平天国的壁画。
    新台门一共五进，鲁迅先生诞生的屋子还保存着。纪念馆馆长方杰同志指给我们看每一间屋里的旧物，像鲁迅先生母亲的卧床，她所读的书，鲁迅先生手植的兰花，以及桌椅箱柜等。由于年代久远，这些遗物不少是从各处陆续收回来的，有些已经由亲友们辨认证实。比如鲁老太太房内有一张有抽屉的四仙桌，鲁迅先生在绍兴中学任学监时从学校回来常坐在这张桌边同老太太谈天。有些老人们记得，他们小时候曾玩弄过这桌子抽屉上所钉拉手的铜环，印象较深，肯定是周家遗物。
    恢复故居当年的面貌不是一件容易的工作。几十年来，屋里的家具不用说已经有极大的更动，就是房屋结构也屡有变迁。需要一点一滴地根据许多人的回忆来布置装备。方馆长说，熟悉童年和少年时代的鲁迅先生以及周家的人，现在还有好几十位，有必要及时地向他们收集有关的史料。纪念馆曾经根据周建人先生的记忆把鲁老太太卧房的窗子配上玻璃，待建人先生再度亲自来看时，觉得光线没有那么亮。以后，建人先生写信来说，他记起来了，窗子只有下部嵌有玻璃，上部是纸糊的。因此还要改装过。　　　　　　　（未完）（附图片）
