    The Decisive Stage of the Soviet-Japanese Negotiations

    Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama has arrived in Moscow, and Soviet-Japanese negotiations are about to resume. The negotiations between the Soviet Union and Japan on the normalization of diplomatic relations have now reached a decisive stage. Originally, the main issues in Soviet-Japanese relations had been basically resolved in previous negotiations. Therefore, it is entirely possible for the two countries to reach an agreement this time negotiations resume.

    The Soviet Union and Japan are neighbors separated only by the sea. Historical factors and the current situation dictate that they should not and cannot remain in a state of prolonged isolation. The early establishment of normal diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Japan is beneficial to promoting the further relaxation of the international situation, leading to the resolution of relevant issues between the Soviet Union and Japan, and thus enhancing the common interests of the two peoples and the interests of world peace.

    Since the London negotiations, the Soviet government, in the spirit of good neighborliness and friendship, has consistently adopted an attitude of understanding and earnestly sought a way to reach an agreement as soon as possible. This attitude has been unanimously supported by the Soviet people and has aroused increasingly enthusiastic responses among the Japanese people. Japanese public opinion has also exerted strong pressure on the Japanese government regarding the restoration of normal Soviet-Japanese relations. In the past, although Soviet-Japanese negotiations have repeatedly encountered setbacks due to man-made obstacles, the movement of the Japanese people demanding the restoration of normal Soviet-Japanese and Sino-Japanese relations has been developing continuously. Many Japanese figures and non-governmental organizations have also engaged in frequent contacts and exchanges with China and the Soviet Union in many areas such as economy, culture, and friendly visits. Under this general trend, some people in the Japanese ruling group have also realized that Soviet-Japanese negotiations cannot be delayed any longer. Hatoyama once stated before deciding to visit the Soviet Union to resume negotiations that he would be sorry to the Japanese people if he did not visit the Soviet Union.

    However, the path to reaching an agreement in these reopened Soviet-Japanese negotiations is not without obstacles. Even on the eve of Hatoyama's departure, some forces in Japan attempted to prevent him from going, and they demanded that Hatoyama still raise disputes on the territorial issue that would be detrimental to the negotiations. At the same time, the United States has not given up its attempts to interfere. Therefore, all those who hope for the restoration of normal Soviet-Japanese relations expect that Hatoyama can overcome domestic constraints and foreign interference that are detrimental to Japan's national interests, follow the wishes of the Japanese people, and reach an agreement with the Soviet Union to restore normal relations. The Japanese people and various forces in Japan that demand independence and autonomy are now continuing their efforts to urge the Japanese authorities to fulfill their promise to restore normal Soviet-Japanese relations and promote Japan's progress on the road to independence and autonomy.

    The Chinese people warmly support any effort that can lead to the restoration and enhancement of Japanese-Soviet relations, and firmly believe that normal Japanese-Soviet relations can be restored; and the restoration of normal Japanese-Soviet relations will not only be beneficial to Japan and the Soviet Union, but will also be a key factor in consolidating peace in this part of the world.

    苏日谈判的决定性阶段
    日本首相鸠山一郎已经到达莫斯科，苏日谈判就要重新开始了。苏日两国关于外交关系正常化的谈判，现在已经到了决定性的阶段。本来，在苏日两国关系中的各个主要问题，在过去几次的谈判中已经基本上得到了解决。因此，这次两国重开谈判，达成协议的可能是完全存在的。
    苏日两国是隔海相望的邻国，历史的因素和当前的形势决定了它们之间是不应当也不可能长久处于隔绝状态的。苏日之间早日建立正常的外交关系，对于促进国际局势的进一步和缓、导致苏日之间有关问题的解决，从而增进两国人民的共同的利益和世界和平的利益，都是有利的。
    苏联政府本着睦邻友好的愿望，从伦敦谈判开始以来就一直采取谅解的态度，热诚地寻求早日达成协议的道路。这种态度得到了苏联人民一致的支持，并且在日本人民中引起了愈来愈热烈的反响。日本的广大舆论对于恢复苏日正常关系问题，也对日本政府进行了有力的督促。在过去时期里，虽然苏日谈判由于遇到人为的障碍而不断发生周折，但是日本人民要求恢复苏日、中日正常关系的运动却一直在发展，许多日本人士和民间团体并在经济、文化和友好访问等许多方面同中国和苏联展开了频繁的接触和来往。在这种大势所趋的局面下，日本统治集团中的一部分人士也认识到苏日谈判不能再拖下去了。鸠山在这次决定访问苏联以恢复谈判之前就曾表示，他如果不去访问苏联，就对不起日本国民。
    但是，这次重开的苏日谈判在达成协议的道路上，并不是没有障碍的。直到鸠山动身前夕，日本还有某些势力企图阻挠他成行，他们并要求鸠山仍然在领土问题上引起不利于谈判的争执。同时美国并没有放弃干涉的企图。因此，一切希望苏日恢复正常关系的人们，都期待着鸠山能克服不利于日本国家利益的国内牵掣和国外干涉，遵循日本人民的意愿，和苏联达成恢复正常关系的协议。日本人民和日本要求独立自主的各种力量，现在也正在继续努力，督促日本当局实现它的恢复苏日正常关系的诺言，并且推动日本在走向独立自主的道路上前进。
    中国人民热烈支持任何一种足以导致日苏关系的恢复和增进的努力，并且深信日苏正常关系是可以恢复的；而日苏正常关系的恢复将不只是有利于日苏两国，而且还将是巩固世界这个部分的和平的一个关键因素。
