    Harvesting Serenade
  　Wei Yang
    This is the best time of year. Seeds sown in March, harvest in September. The beans are barely cut, the millet is golden yellow. Love was sown in March, but marriage is not yet settled in September. This is the best time, girl, don't deliberately make things difficult for the one in your heart.
  The sickle cuts the rice stalks with a "cha-cha" sound. I secretly compete with the girl beside me, the sickle cuts the rice stalks with a "cha-cha" sound; I am determined to surpass her, cutting, cutting, sweat dripping on my wrist. After cutting for a while, I glance at her sideways, she is shoulder to shoulder with me, calm and unhurried; after cutting for a while, I glance at her sideways, meeting her eyes sparkling. Ah, who knows what kind of girl I will meet in the future, I hope she is exactly like the one beside me.

    收割小唱
  　未央
    这是最好的时辰三月播下了种子，九月有了收成，豆子才割尽，谷子黄澄澄。三月播下了爱情，九月还没有成亲，这是最好的时辰呀，姑娘，莫再故意难为你心上的人。
  镰刀割得稻梗嚓嚓响我暗地里和身旁的姑娘竞赛，镰刀割得稻梗嚓嚓响；我一心想拉下她，割呀，割呀，汗珠儿滴在手腕上。割一会，我斜着眼睛朝她望，她和我肩并着肩，不慌不忙；割一会，我斜着眼睛朝她望，碰着她的眼珠儿闪闪发光。哎，谁知道我将来能遇上一个什么
  样的姑娘，但愿她和我身旁的这位一模一样。
