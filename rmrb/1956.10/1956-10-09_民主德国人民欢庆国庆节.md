Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 8th: The working people of Berlin celebrated their holiday—the seventh anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic—on the 7th.

　　All the buildings, large and small, in the city were hung with black, red, and gold flags, and colorful stages were set up in all the squares. Groups of people broke with the usual Sunday custom of going to the suburbs and flocked to the city center.

　　On the morning of that day, long lines of working people presented wreaths at the Soviet War Memorial in Berlin and the Cemetery of German Socialist Pioneers.

　　Although the Brandenburg Gate, a historical building that Germans once took pride in, has now become the dividing line between East and West Berlin, its gates are wide open. A large number of residents from West Berlin passed through the Brandenburg Gate to enthusiastically participate in the National Day celebrations of the German Democratic Republic in the democratic zone.

　　Marx-Engels Square was dressed in festive attire on this day. A huge emblem of the German Democratic Republic was erected on the front of the square, with colorful flags hanging all around, and the tricolor flag flying in the very center. The stands were crowded with people long before. At 2:30 p.m., after the rain cleared, the loudspeakers announced, "The program celebrating the seventh anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic begins, wishing everyone a happy holiday!"

　　Xinhua News Agency, 8th: TASS, Berlin, 7th: The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic held a National Day reception on October 7th.

　　民主德国人民欢庆国庆节
    据新华社柏林8日电　柏林市劳动人民7日欢度了自己的节日——德意志民主共和国成立七周年。
    全城的大小建筑物上挂满了黑红黄三色国旗，在所有的广场上都搭起了五色缤纷的舞台。成群结队的人们打破了星期天出城郊游的惯例，涌向市中心区。
    这天上午，排得长长的劳动人民的行列在柏林苏军烈士墓和德国社会主义先驱者公墓前呈献花圈。
    过去德国人引以自豪的凯旋门古建筑今天虽然变成了东西柏林的分界线，但是，它的大门是洞开的，西柏林的大批居民通过凯旋门来到民主区热情地参加民主德国国庆节的庆祝活动。
    马克思—恩格斯广场在这一天披上了节日的盛装，广场正面扎着巨幅的德意志民主共和国国徽，四周遍悬彩色旗帜，正中心飘扬着三色国旗。看台上老早就挤满了人。下午二时半，雨过天晴，扩音器里传出了“德意志民主共和国成立七周年庆祝节目开始，祝大家节日愉快！”的语句。
    据新华社8日讯　据塔斯社柏林7日讯：民主德国部长会议在10月7日举行国庆招待会。
