    Harbin Pharmaceutical Factory
    Sells Fake Drugs for Profit
    According to an inspection by the Harbin Municipal Bureau of Supervision, the Local State-Owned Harbin Pharmaceutical Factory has 43 products of substandard quality. Some of the drugs were shipped to other places, and then returned to the factory for rework; some were reworked once, and then reworked a second or third time. For some products that originally had quality problems, the factory leaders thought they should be sent out to see what happened, and then reworked if problems arose, because the profit was high anyway, and a little loss was worth it. Of the more than 320,000 ten-milliliter ampules of liver extract injection produced from January to October 1954, more than 290,000 ampules were reworked due to excessive sedimentation, some of them reworked more than three times; the rework loss amounted to more than 93,000 yuan. Some vitamin C injections were reworked due to floating matter and insufficient content; vitamin A and B pills were bottled before they were dried properly, resulting in the pills sticking together. From January 1954 to November 1955, a total of 50 similar quality incidents occurred, with losses amounting to more than 195,000 yuan. At the same time, due to blind production and low quality, the value of stockpiled products was more than 300,000 yuan.
    More seriously, this factory actually replaced full-dose drugs with drugs of insufficient content. For example, the liver extract injection produced in 1954 originally had a content of 5 to 10 grams, but because the pharmaceutical company wanted 32 grams, the factory resorted to deception, labeling the 5 to 10 gram liver extract injection with 32 gram labels, and selling 901,300 ampules. Even now, these fake drugs are still on the market.
    The factory made a very high profit by using this method. The average profit in 1954 was 57.4%. Among them, the actual profit of ten-milliliter liver extract injection was as high as 356%; the profit of two-milliliter pilose antler extract produced in 1955 was as high as 211.11%. But did this factory ever consider the impact of these drugs on the health of patients? 　　　　Zhou Ruiwu

### 哈尔滨制药厂  贪图利润出卖假药

    哈尔滨制药厂
    贪图利润出卖假药
    据哈尔滨市监察局检查，地方国营哈尔滨制药厂有四十三种产品质量不好。有些药品已经运往外地，又退回厂里返工；有的返工了一次，又返第二次、第三次。有的产品质量本来有问题，厂的领导人员却认为发出去看看，出了问题再返工，反正利润大，损失一点也上算。他们在1954年1至10月生产的三十二万多支十西西肝精注射液，因为沉淀过重而返工的就有二十九万多支，其中有的返工三次以上；返工损失达九万三千多元。有些维他命丙针剂，因为有浮游物和含量不足而返工；维他命甲乙丸没有干燥好就装瓶，结果药粒粘在一起了。从1954年1月到1955年11月，类似质量事故共发生了五十起，损失达十九万五千多元。同时，由于盲目生产和质量不高，积压的产品值三十多万元。
    更严重的是，这个厂竟用含量不足的药品顶替足量的药品。如1954年生产的肝精注射液，本来含量是五至十克，因为医药公司要三十二克的，这个厂就弄虚作假，把五克到十克的肝精注射液贴上三十二克的标签，出售了九十万一千三百支。直到现在，市场上还有这种假药。
    这个厂采取这种办法获得了很高的利润。1954年平均利润是57.4％。其中十西西的肝精注射液实际利润高达356％；1955年出产的二西西鹿茸精利润高达211.11％。但是，这些药品对病人的健康影响如何，这个厂是否也曾考虑过呢？　　　　周锐武
