Xinhua News Agency, October 2nd: After a refreshing autumn rain, the Summer Palace today welcomed over 1,600 distinguished guests from more than 50 countries. Mayor Peng Zhen of Beijing held a grand garden party here attended by more than 6,000 people.

President Sukarno, Prime Minister Acharya and his wife, accompanied by Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman Song Qingling, Vice Premier Ulanhu, and Mayor Peng Zhen, attended today's garden party. After appreciating the traditional Chinese paintings displayed in the Garden of Virtue and Harmony (Dehe Yuan), they arrived at the Yile Hall to watch a song and dance performance on the grand stage. The Indonesian folk dance "Umbrella Dance," performed by eight female dancers, immediately piqued President Sukarno's interest. He initially clapped along to the rhythm for the dancers inside the hall, then walked out of the Yile Hall and onto the opposite stage, dancing along with the performers' steps. After the performance, President Sukarno warmly shook hands with all the performers and invited Prime Minister Acharya, Vice Chairman Zhu, Premier Zhou, and Vice Chairman Song to take a photo with the actors.

After admiring chrysanthemums at the Hall of Joyful Longevity (Leshou Tang), the distinguished guests walked through a long corridor lined with potted jasmine, hibiscus, and other colorful flowers.

After visiting the Hall of Dispelling Clouds (Paiyun Dian), the distinguished guests met Chairman Liu Shaoqi at the Listening to Orioles Hall (Tingli Guan), where they rested briefly and watched an acrobatics performance. Afterwards, the distinguished guests boarded two specially prepared dragon boats in front of the Fish and Algae Pavilion (Yuzao Xuan) to admire the Tower of Buddhist Incense (Foxiang Ge) on Longevity Hill on the lake. As the dragon boats slowly sailed towards the center of the lake, many small boats carrying tourists surrounded them, and people sang an Indonesian song "Hello, Hello, Bandung" for the guests. President Sukarno asked them to sing it again, waved his hand, and joined in the chorus. The singing and accordion music on the lake accompanied the distinguished guests until they disembarked at the Jade Ripple Hall (Yulan Tang).

The entire Summer Palace was immersed in an atmosphere of friendship and joy today. Some guests strolled along the tree-lined paths, while others rested on lakeside pavilions. Everywhere there was laughter and harmonious conversation. Mr. Houssman, the 85-year-old Speaker of the Belgian House of Representatives, was in high spirits, taking a tour of the garden, and fishing by the Clear and Calm Boat (Qingyan Fang) with Belgian Communist Party member of parliament, Mr. Lalmand. Inside the Clear and Calm Boat, the singing had not stopped, and dance music began again. The hosts warmly invited friends from Yugoslavia, India, Japan, and the United Kingdom to dance the foxtrot. People recognized an Egyptian guest from the crowd, lifted him up, and threw him into the air, excitedly shouting: "China-Egypt", "Egypt-China".

Many distinguished guests climbed the approximately 60-meter-high Tower of Buddhist Incense to overlook the lake and mountain scenery. Friends from the Syrian cultural delegation were very interested in this magnificent building with more than 200 years of history, and they also took photos in front of the "Welcoming Buddha" as a memento. The workers' delegations from various Arab countries met artists from the Indonesian Bali Art Friendship Delegation in front of the Tower of Buddhist Incense, and they cheered each other: "Bung Karno", "Arab". The Indian Parliament Delegation, accompanied by Vice Chairman Li Jishen, visited the Hall of Dispelling Clouds and other places. The head of the delegation, Mr. Ayyangar, Speaker of the Indian Lok Sabha, looked up at the Tower of Buddhist Incense on the top of the mountain in front of the Hall of Dispelling Clouds and praised the Tower of Buddhist Incense as truly beautiful and good-looking.

In front of the Hall of Dispelling Clouds, guests and diplomatic officials from various countries danced the foxtrot with Chinese students. Pakistani football players joined the dance circle, and the famous forward Musa led the dance of a Pakistani folk dance. Indonesian dancer Ms. Made Manik also walked into the crowd and performed the Indonesian folk dance "Bamboo Dance." The famous Indonesian Balinese dancer Ni Lu Zhawan was surrounded by people everywhere, and she performed a segment of the "Bang Ji Shi Mei Lan" dance by Kunming Lake.

In front of the shooting range set up at the National Flower Terrace east of the Hall of Dispelling Clouds, many foreign guests were "hunting" here. People cheered for Mr. Pongracz, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Budapest City Council in Hungary, praising him as a "sharpshooter." He won first prize in both of his shooting attempts.

On the mountain road under the "Sea of Wisdom" (Zhihui Hai) on the top of Longevity Hill, the International Buddhist Monks Delegation met their Japanese counterparts here – members of the Japanese Six Metropolitan, Prefectural, Municipal Visiting Delegation to China, the Japanese monk Ninmichi Omura. Omura asked Master Badanda Ananda Kausalayayana to sign a memento and took a photo of this Indian Master of Dhamma.

On Kunming Lake, the Sudanese Women's Delegation, traveling by painted boat on the lake, saw Chairman Liu Shaoqi walking along the shore and immediately approached the shore to wave to him. Chairman Liu Shaoqi came to the railing and shook hands with them one by one, and the Sudanese women sang a "Song of Peace" in their native language. Chairman Liu Shaoqi wished Sudan victory in its independence.

Guests who came to the South Lake (Nan Hu) liked to go to the Hanxu Hall on the small hill to enjoy Chinese folk music. The "White Snow in the Sunny Spring", played by nine pipas in unison, won enthusiastic applause from guests from Japan, Ireland and Italy present.

As night fell, a gentle breeze brought a slight chill, and the guests and hosts had a pleasant afternoon. At this time, the guests held the hosts' hands tightly, thanking them for their warm hospitality. As the long line of cars returned to the city from the tree-lined avenue, the main streets were already brightly lit.

    彭真市长举行盛大游园会招待外宾
    据新华社2日讯　秋雨初霁的颐和园今天接待了来自五十多个国家的一千六百多位贵宾。北京市市长彭真在这里举行了一次有六千多人参加的盛大游园会。
  苏加诺总统、阿查里雅首相和夫人由朱德副主席、周恩来总理、宋庆龄副委员长、乌兰夫副总理、彭真市长陪同参加了今天的游园会。他们欣赏了陈列在德和园的国画以后，来到颐乐殿观看了大戏台上的歌舞表演。由八位女舞蹈演员表演的印度尼西亚民间舞蹈“伞舞”，一开始就引起苏加诺总统的兴趣。他起初在殿内为舞蹈者击掌合拍，然后走出颐乐殿登上对面的舞台，伴合表演者的舞步舞蹈。在表演结束后，苏加诺总统同全体演员亲切地握手，并且邀请阿查里雅首相、朱副主席、周总理、宋副委员长一起同演员们照了像。
    贵宾们在乐寿堂赏菊后，步过了两旁排满茉莉、扶桑等各色盆花的长廊。
    在登上排云殿参观以后，贵宾们来到听鹂馆会见了刘少奇委员长，并且在这里略事休息和观看了杂技表演。然后，贵宾们又在鱼藻轩前面登上为他们特备的两只龙舟，在湖上观赏万寿山上的佛香阁。龙舟缓缓驶向湖心，许多只载着游人的小艇围上前来，人们为客人们齐唱一支印度尼西亚歌曲“哈啰，哈啰，万隆”。苏加诺总统请他们重唱了一遍，并挥手打着拍子，自己也加入了合唱。湖上的歌声和手风琴声，伴随着贵宾们直到他们在玉澜堂登岸离去。
    整个颐和园今天沉浸在友爱欢乐的气氛中。来宾们有的在林荫道上散步，有的人坐在沿湖亭上休息，到处有欢笑，到处有融洽的交谈。八十五岁高龄的比利时众议院议长胡斯曼游兴勃勃，在园中绕了一圈，并且和比利时共产党议员拉尔曼一起在清宴舫旁垂钓。在清宴舫里，歌声未停，舞曲又起。主人们热情地邀请南斯拉夫、印度、日本、英国的朋友们跳起交谊舞。人们从人群中认出一位埃及客人，他们把他抬起来，抛向空中，大家激动地喊着：“中国—埃及”、“埃及—中国”。
    许多贵宾登上高约六十公尺的佛香阁，眺望湖山景色。叙利亚文化代表团的朋友们对这座有二百多年历史的雄伟建筑很感兴趣，他们还在“接引佛”前摄影留念。阿拉伯各国工人代表团在佛香阁前遇到了印度尼西亚峇厘艺术友好访问团的艺术家们，他们互相欢呼：“朋加诺”、“阿拉伯”。印度国会代表团在李济深副委员长陪同下游览了排云殿等处。代表团团长、印度人民院议长阿延加尔在排云殿前仰望山顶上的佛香阁等处，连声称赞佛香阁真漂亮，真好看。
    在排云殿前，各国来宾和外交官员们同中国的学生在一起跳起交谊舞。巴基斯坦的足球队员们插进了舞圈，著名前锋穆萨带头跳起了巴基斯坦民族舞。印度尼西亚的女舞蹈家玛德·玛尼克也走进这里的人群中，表演了印度尼西亚民间舞蹈“竹筒舞”。著名的印度尼西亚峇厘舞蹈家尼·鲁·楂宛到处被人们包围起来，她在昆明湖边表演了“邦吉·什美兰”舞中的一个片段。
    设置在排云殿以东国花台的射击台前，有许多外宾在这里“打猎”。人们都为匈牙利布达佩斯市议会执行委员会主席庞格拉茨喝采，称赞他是“神枪手”。他两次射击都获得了一等奖。
    在万寿山顶“智慧海”下的山道上，国际佛教僧侣代表团在这里遇见了他们的日本同道——日本六大都、府、县、市访华团团员、日本僧人大村仁道。大村仁道请巴丹达·阿难陀·柯萨尔雅雅那法师签名留念，并且给这位印度陀法师照了像。
    在昆明湖上，乘坐画舫游湖的苏丹妇女代表团看见刘少奇委员长在岸旁走过，立刻划近湖岸，向他招手致意。刘少奇委员长来到栏杆前和她们一一握手，苏丹妇女用她们本国的语言唱起了“和平之歌”。刘少奇委员长祝苏丹独立胜利。
    来到南湖的客人，都喜欢到小山上的涵虚堂欣赏中国民族乐曲。九只琵琶齐奏的“阳春白雪”，博得在场的日本、爱尔兰和意大利的客人的热烈掌声。
    夜幕来临了，轻风带来了微寒，客人们和主人们愉快地度过整个下午。这时，客人紧紧握着主人的手，感谢殷勤的招待。当长列的汽车从林荫大道回到城里的时候，通衢大街已经灯光辉煌。
