Xinhua News Agency report: Currently, in Anhui province, over 100,000 workers are participating in cultural studies, more than double the number from last year.

In the first half of this year, over 10,000 workers throughout the province have already escaped illiteracy. With the progress of literacy campaigns and the needs of industrial development, the number of workers participating in middle school classes has increased from over 2,900 last year to over 7,700 in the first half of this year.

In order to rapidly improve the cultural level of workers, the Anhui Provincial Federation of Trade Unions convened a meeting on spare-time cultural education for workers in March this year. The meeting studied and summarized past problems, and decided to transfer the management of spare-time cultural education for workers to the local government education departments or enterprise administrative departments. Currently, all regions have been equipped with necessary full-time cadres, developed education plans, and some units have also allocated funds to build school buildings and purchase teaching reference books. The workers have a high enthusiasm for learning. At the Datong Coal Mine in Huainan and the Baoxing Flour Mill in Bengbu, 90% of the workers participate in spare-time learning. In the First Brigade of the Wuhu Transportation Company, more than 30 old workers aged fifty or sixty also participate in literacy classes and study groups. Han Yumin, a mother of seven children at the Wuhu Cotton Mill, has never been absent or late for class since she began studying.

    安徽十万职工参加文化学习
    已有万余职工脱离文盲状态
    新华社讯　安徽省各地现在有十万多名职工参加文化学习，比去年增加一倍多。
    今年上半年，全省已经有一万多工人脱离了文盲状态。随着扫盲工作的进展和工业发展的需要，上半年参加中学班的工人已由去年的二千九百多人增加到七千七百多人。
    安徽省工会联合会为了迅速提高职工的文化水平，今年三月里曾召开了职工业余文化教育会议，研究和总结了过去存在的问题，并且决定将职工业余文化教育工作移交给当地政府教育部门或企业行政部门管理。现在，各地都配备了必要的专职干部，制定了教育计划，有的单位还拨款修建了校舍，添置了教学参考书籍。职工们学习热情很高。淮南大通煤矿、蚌埠宝兴面粉厂职工参加业余学习的占全体职工的90％。芜湖市搬运公司第一大队有三十多个五、六十岁的老工人也参加了识字班和学习小组。芜湖纱厂七个孩子的妈妈韩玉敏参加学习以来，一直未旷课和迟到。
