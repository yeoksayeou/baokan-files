Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: Arbitrary arrests and imprisonment by the Chiang Kai-shek clique's Taiwan Provincial Security Command and courts have caused widespread resentment in Taiwan.

According to Taiwan newspaper reports, during a recent meeting of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's Legislative Yuan, some "legislators" also believed that the courts were casually detaining criminal suspects, resulting in many wrongly detained people, greatly affecting public sentiment. They also demanded that the Chiang Kai-shek clique's Ministry of Justice compile statistics on the number of people detained by the courts over the past four years who were ultimately found not guilty or received non-prosecution dispositions, to see how many wrongful convictions there have been over the years. In September, the Chiang Kai-shek clique's Control Yuan also passed a proposal accusing the Chiang Kai-shek clique's Taiwan Provincial Security Command of often arbitrarily arresting people and detaining them for interrogation for long periods of time, so that human rights were not guaranteed. The "Control Yuan" also accused the "Taipei District Court Detention Center" of holding far more people than its capacity allowed, "overcrowded and inhumane."

An article from a Taipei reader published not long ago in a pro-American Chiang newspaper in Hong Kong also stated that the situation of "too many man-made wrongful convictions" in Taiwan was "chilling." The article said that the saying, "The yamen gate opens wide, enter not with reason but without money," is often quoted in Taiwan. In Taiwan, it is "commonplace and unsurprising" for people to be arbitrarily arrested and imprisoned during the investigation of a case. As a result, some people are released without charge after litigating for two or three years, ending up with broken families, wives separated, and children scattered.

    随意捕人，长期扣押
    台湾冤狱多
    新华社18日讯　蒋介石集团台湾省保安司令部和法院等机构随意捕人入狱，在台湾已引起怨声载道。
    据台湾报刊消息，最近蒋介石集团立法院在一次会议中，有些“立法委员”也认为法院随便羁押人犯，致冤枉被押者甚多，影响人心很大，并且要求蒋介石集团司法行政部把四年来经法庭羁押，最后判决无罪或受不起诉处分者的数目统计一下，看看数年来到底有多少冤狱。蒋介石集团监察院在9月间也通过了一个提案，指责蒋介石集团台湾省保安司令部，往往随意捕人，长期加以扣押侦讯，以致人权没有保障。“监察院”还指责“台北地方法院看守所”扣押的人超过容额甚多，“拥挤不堪，有伤人道”。
    香港一家亲美蒋的报纸不久前发表的一个台北读者的来稿也说：台湾“人为冤狱太多”的情形使人“不寒而栗”。这篇文章说，“衙门八字开，有理无钱莫进来”这句话在台湾经常被引用。在台湾，案件侦察期间人们被随便捕去坐牢，这是“司空见惯不足惊奇”的事。结果有些人官司打了两三年，无罪释放，落得个家破人亡妻离子散。
