Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 14th -- The Vietnamese newspaper "Nhan Dan" published a commentary today stating that the head of the U.S. economic aid agency in Saigon, Mr. Barross, recently announced at a meeting of the so-called "Vietnam-America Association" that the United States had provided the Ngo Dinh Diem regime with $500 million in aid over the past two years, of which $320 million was for military expenditures. It is clear that the majority of American aid is aimed at strengthening South Vietnam's armaments, turning South Vietnam into an American military base and a hotbed of war in Indochina.

Regarding the United States illegally transporting weapons, ammunition, and military personnel into South Vietnam, the commentary said that the United States' goal is to organize, equip, and train an army in South Vietnam like those of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, in order to serve the United States' aggressive plans in Indochina and Southeast Asia. American imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem regime are striving to increase South Vietnam's regular army to 175,000 men in 1956, while also establishing a 75,000-man security force and many other armed organizations. Therefore, they are using repressive and deceptive means to force the people of South Vietnam to enlist and force overseas Chinese to adopt Vietnamese nationality in order to facilitate forcing them into military service.

The commentary emphasized that the United States' military infiltration into South Vietnam has seriously violated the Geneva Accords and threatened peace in Southeast Asia. The people of South Vietnam and world public opinion cannot but feel concerned about this and resolutely oppose it.

    违反日内瓦协定　威胁东南亚和平
    美国竭力加强南越军备
    新华社河内14日电　越南“人民报”今天发表评论说，美国驻西贡经济援助机关的头子巴罗斯最近在所谓“越美协会”的一次会议上宣布：在过去两年中，美国曾经援助吴庭艳政权五亿美元，其中军事开支三亿二千万美元。这很明显，美国的大部分援助，目的在于加强南越的军备，把南越变成美国的军事基地和印度支那的战争的温床。
    对于美国把武器、弹药和军事人员非法运进南越一事，评论说，美国的目的是在南越组织、装备和训练一支像李承晚和蒋介石式的军队，以便为美国在印度支那和东南亚的侵略计划服务。美帝国主义和吴庭艳政权正努力在1956年把南越的正规军增加到十七万五千人，同时建立一支七万五千人的保安队和其他许多武装组织。因此，他们使用了镇压和欺骗的手段，强迫南越人民当兵，强迫华侨入越南籍，以便于迫使华侨当兵。
    评论强调说，美国在南越的军事渗入已经严重地违反了日内瓦协定，威胁了东南亚的和平。南越人民和世界舆论对此不能不感到忧虑并且坚决反对。
