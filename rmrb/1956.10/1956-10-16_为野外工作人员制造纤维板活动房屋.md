Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 14th: Shenyang City has recently designed and successfully trial-produced a type of fiberboard mobile home. In addition to serving as dormitories for field workers, this mobile home can also be converted into residences, warehouses, and offices. The first batch of mobile homes is about to be manufactured.

This mobile home looks similar to an ordinary house, with windows and doors, and a spacious and bright interior. It can be assembled using only a few hundred pieces of hardened fiberboard and some wood and iron parts, costing just over 20 yuan per square meter. The columns of the mobile home are nailed to deeply buried wooden stakes, so it cannot be blown away by strong winds. Disassembly and assembly are also very convenient, and a truck can transport all of its components.

It was designed by Wu Feiran, assistant engineer of the Fourth Engineering Bureau of the General Bureau of Highway Engineering. The hardened plant fiberboard used is made of sawdust and rice husks mixed with magnesium chloride and bittern. It has high strength, light weight, and properties such as fire prevention and cold protection. The prefabrication procedure is also simple, making it suitable for mass production. At a technical symposium specially convened by the Shenyang Municipal Planning Commission, many engineering and technical personnel believed that the design of this mobile home could be vigorously promoted with slight improvements.

    为野外工作人员制造纤维板活动房屋
    新华社沈阳14日电　沈阳市新近设计和试制成功一种纤维板活动房屋。这种活动房屋除了可以作为野外工作人员的宿舍以外，还可以改装成住宅、仓库、办公室。现在第一批活动房屋快要制造出来。
    这种活动房屋的样子和普通房屋差不多，有窗有门，屋内宽畅明亮。它只要用几百块硬化纤维板和一些木材、铁件就能装配起来造价每平方公尺二十多元。活动房屋的柱子钉在埋得很深的木桩上，大风也吹不走；拆卸、装配又很方便，一辆卡车就可以把它的全部配件运走。
    它是公路工程总局第四工程局助理工程师吴斐然设计出来的。所用的硬化植物纤维板，由锯木屑，稻糠掺上菱苦土，卤水制成。它的强度高、重量小，有防火、御寒等性能；预制的手续也很简便，适于大量制造。在沈阳市计划委员会专门召开的一个技术座谈会上，许多工程技术人员认为这种活动房屋的设计只要稍加改进，就可以大力推广。
