Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 13th: A message from Hong Kong at 6:00 PM states: The riots instigated by Kuomintang special agents have disrupted the normal lives of two million residents in Kowloon and Hong Kong.

　　Tens of thousands of residents in Kowloon have been forced to stop their normal work, staying at home, anxiously preparing to cope with the rioting and attacks by the thugs at any time.

　　The prices of rice, food, and daily necessities, essential for the daily lives of Kowloon residents, have soared. Rice prices have already risen by 50% to 100% compared to normal times. Pork and beef prices have increased by an average of 10%, eggs have risen by 50%, and vegetable prices have also increased.

　　There is a shortage of food such as grains, canned goods, and meat products in the market. Panic buying has occurred in the market. Some poor residents are in dire straits because their work has been suspended.

　　The impact has also been felt in Hong Kong, with slight price increases. Rice prices have increased by five to eight mace per picul. A spokesperson for the Hong Kong Civic Association said yesterday that if order in Kowloon cannot be restored soon, grain prices will continue to rise.

　　The Acting Colonial Secretary of the Hong Kong British authorities issued a special broadcast at 8:15 AM this morning, urging residents not to engage in panic buying of food.

　　The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and other banks announced the suspension of check clearing at around 10:00 AM on the 12th. The stock exchange announced the suspension of trading shortly after opening on the 12th.

　　The business of large trading firms such as the Da Hang Trading Company has decreased by half compared to normal times. Bank deposits, loans, and import/export bills of exchange are also only half of what they usually are.

　　Larger factories in Kowloon have all stopped production. Although manufacturers in Hong Kong are still operating as usual, they are in an abnormal state due to supply difficulties. Business is very sluggish in both Hong Kong and Kowloon. Not only is there very little trading of large quantities, but business in various retail stores, restaurants, tea houses, and entertainment venues is also very slow.

　　The Kowloon post office has stopped receiving and sending mail for several days. Kowloon residents' telegrams cannot be delivered due to traffic disruption and people must be notified by telephone.

    港九居民正常生活遭破坏
    据新华社广州13日电　香港下午六时消息：国民党特务分子制造的骚乱事件破坏了九龙和香港二百万居民的正常生活。
    九龙地区数以万计的居民被迫停止正常工作，守在家里，惊慌地准备随时应付暴徒的骚乱和袭击。
    九龙居民日常生活所必需的米粮、食料和日用品的物价纷纷暴涨。米价已经比平时上涨50％到100％，猪肉、牛肉平均上涨了10％，鸡蛋上涨了50％，蔬菜价格也有上涨。
    粮食、罐头、肉食等食品，在市场上呈短缺现象，市场上曾发生抢购，有些贫苦的居民因为工作停顿，他们的生活已陷于困境。
    香港方面影响所及，物价也有少许上涨，米价每担涨了五毛至八毛。香港公民协会发言人昨日说，如果九龙秩序不能早日恢复，粮食价格将会继续上涨。
    香港英国当局署理辅政司今晨八时十五分特发表了一项特别广播，要求居民不要抢购粮食。
    香港汇丰银行和其他银行12日上午十时许宣布停止票据交换。股票交易所在12日开始不久就宣布停止交易。
    经营批发生意的大行庄和洋行，生意比平时减少了一半，银行的存、放款、进入口押汇也只及平时的一半。
    九龙规模较大的工厂都已停工，香港的厂家虽照常开工，但由于补给困难，也处于不正常的状态。香港和九龙的商场都很萧条。不仅大量成交的极小，各行门市和酒楼、茶室和娱乐场所的生意也很冷落。
    九龙邮局已有几天停止收发邮件。九龙居民的电报因交通停顿，无法投递，只得用电话通知收电报的人。
