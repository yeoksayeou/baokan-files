Speech by Comrade Chen Yu, Minister of the Coal Industry Department

During the Second Five-Year Plan, China's capital construction and industrial and agricultural production will continue to maintain a relatively rapid development speed. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the construction of the coal industry to ensure that the industry and transportation sectors have a sufficient quantity of coal, and to appropriately meet the needs of urban and rural coal consumption. The construction tasks of the coal industry are very arduous. I would now like to express some opinions on the issue of the long-term plan for the coal industry.

In the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan, we met the needs of China's industrial development and civilian coal consumption by carrying out production reforms and restoration and reconstruction work on existing mines, improving labor productivity, and leveraging the potential of existing mines. It is estimated that the national coal production in 1956 can reach 108 million tons, which is close to the production level of the First Five-Year Plan in 1957. While increasing the production capacity of existing mines, we actively carried out the construction of new mines and new coal industrial bases. As of the end of 1956, the new mines under construction by state-owned coal mines nationwide will have an annual production capacity of 33.7 million tons, and the new mines put into production by state-owned coal mines nationwide (including the new mines started before the First Five-Year Plan) will have an annual production capacity of 16.25 million tons. At the same time, geological, design, and construction forces have developed greatly from scratch. Now, with the help of Soviet experts, we can design and construct large mines.

The development of the coal industry is not adapted to the needs

Although the coal production target set in the First Five-Year Plan can be overfulfilled, it still cannot meet the coal needs during 1957 and the Second Five-Year Plan period.

Although the national coal production can overfulfill the target set in the First Five-Year Plan, a tight situation of coal supply falling short of demand will still appear in 1957. More seriously, the scale of capital construction of the coal industry in the First Five-Year Plan is not adapted to the requirements of the development of the coal industry, and it will not be able to meet the needs of national economic development for coal during the Second Five-Year Plan period. In order to complete the tasks given to the coal industry by the Central Committee of the Party regarding the Second Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to learn from the experiences in the implementation process of the First Five-Year Plan, take measures to strive to overfulfill the capital construction tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan, and do a good job in preparing for the Second Five-Year Plan.

The First Five-Year Plan stipulates that coal production should increase by an average of 12% per year, and that the total industrial output value nationwide should increase by an average of 14.7% per year. According to the statistics from 1953 to 1956 and the estimates for 1957, the development speed of the total industrial output value nationwide is about 17%. In order to meet the needs of industrial development, this correspondingly requires that the development speed of coal production must reach about 16%. However, it is estimated that it can only reach about 13%, and the national coal production in 1957 can only reach about 120 million tons. The national coal demand is about 130 million tons, which forms a situation of coal supply falling short of demand. The above situation shows that, in the implementation of the plan, the over-planned development of other industries is greater than the over-planned development of the coal industry, which has aggravated the tension in coal supply.

The scale of capital construction of the coal industry in the First Five-Year Plan must be increased, otherwise it will not only affect coal production during the First Five-Year Plan period, but more seriously, it will affect the long-term development of the coal industry and will not be able to guarantee the needs of national economic development during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, coal production mainly relied on existing mines. In 1957, the output of existing mines accounted for about 85% of the total output. The situation will be different during the Second Five-Year Plan period. To meet the need for coal, we must rely more on the new mines built during the First and Second Five-Year Plan periods. The output of new mines depends on the scale of construction of new mines and the time of commencement of construction. Because the time required for the completion of a mine and the achievement of its designed production capacity is very long, by 1962, the output of the new mines built during the First Five-Year Plan period can only reach about 85% of their production capacity, while the output of the new mines built during the Second Five-Year Plan period can only reach 10% to 15% of their total production capacity by 1962. Therefore, the size of the construction scale of new mines during the First Five-Year Plan period basically determines the speed of production growth of the coal industry during the Second Five-Year Plan period. Because the construction scale of mines during the First Five-Year Plan period (annual production capacity of 43.5 million tons) is small, there are many difficulties in achieving a national coal production of 190 million tons in 1962, which is still far from the demand in 1962 (210 million to 220 million tons). After discovering this serious problem, it was proposed in 1955 to increase the construction scale of state-owned coal mines by about 10 million tons, but due to difficulties in investment, materials, and equipment supply, this plan has not been realized so far. Moreover, whether the construction tasks of mines and coal washing plants stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan can be completed is not guaranteed due to the limitations of investment, materials, and equipment supply. This will have extremely unfavorable effects on the development of the national economy during the Second Five-Year Plan period, especially on the supply of coking coal needed by the steel industry.

Properly arrange the 1957 coal production plan

Strive to build more mines that can produce several million tons of coal than originally planned

In order to strive to avoid this situation, it is very important to properly arrange the 1957 coal production plan and correctly formulate the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the coal industry.

In 1957, we must ensure the completion of the construction tasks of mines and coal washing plants stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan, and we should also actively create conditions to strive to build more mines that can produce several million tons of coal than originally planned. To this end, it is necessary to solve the problems of investment, equipment, and material supply. Railways and power supplies, which are extremely important for coal mine construction, should also be resolved accordingly. In particular, it is hoped that the railway from Huangni to Bo'ai will be opened to traffic in the first half of 1958, and the railway from Baotou to Lanzhou will be built to the Shizuishan mining area. This is a prerequisite for guaranteeing coking coal for the Wuhan steel industry and guaranteeing coal for new industrial cities in the northwest.

Correctly formulate the Second Five-Year Plan for the coal industry development plan

It is necessary to maintain a certain reserve production capacity in the coal industry and establish a national coal reserve system.

When formulating the Second Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to carefully calculate the amount of coal needed for national economic development, so that the development of the coal industry's production level is balanced with the amount of coal needed for China's national economic development. When calculating the amount of coal needed, it is necessary to fully consider the possibility that the over-planned development of other industries is greater than the over-planned development of the coal industry. Therefore, when stipulating the production level of the coal industry, it is necessary to maintain a certain reserve production capacity and establish a national coal reserve system. When considering the construction scale of the coal industry, it is necessary to make the construction scale and the requirements for the production level of the coal industry adapted to each other, especially to be adapted to the development requirements of the coal industry's production level in the Third Five-Year Plan. At the same time, because the construction time of mines is long, it is impossible to solve the extremely tight situation of coal supply falling short of demand that has already formed by using the method of adding projects in the annual plan.

In the construction of the coal industry, the construction of the coal mining machinery manufacturing industry is very important. Due to the characteristics of coal mine underground operations, it is necessary to give more mechanical equipment, such as mine hoisting, drainage, ventilation, and other mechanical equipment are indispensable. The conditions of underground operations are difficult and the labor is heavy. It is necessary to effectively and systematically vigorously promote the mechanization of heavy labor, which requires a large number of mining, loading, handling, grabbing and other mechanical equipment. Underground operations are carried out in constant struggle with changes in natural conditions and natural disasters—water, fire, gas, and coal dust. It is necessary to earnestly pay attention to safety and labor protection work, which requires explosion-proof electrical equipment, safety rescue equipment, and instruments. During the First Five-Year Plan period, because we did not pay enough attention to this work, the progress of production technology improvement and capital construction was often affected due to equipment supply problems. The number of equipment needed by coal mines during the Second Five-Year Plan period will be greatly increased compared with the First Five-Year Plan period, about 1.9 million tons. In the past, the equipment relied on foreign imports will be more and more solved by domestic production. Therefore, it is necessary to actively strengthen the construction of mine equipment manufacturing, otherwise it will be impossible to complete this huge-scale construction task, improve labor productivity in coal mines, improve the situation of safe production, and improve labor conditions. China currently does not have a complete foundation for the manufacture of coal mining equipment. The problem is to specialize the factories that already have certain experience in manufacturing equipment for coal mines across the country, give play to their potential in manufacturing coal mining equipment, and serve coal mines exclusively. For those urgently needed but currently unavailable, such as large electric shovels, electric locomotives, mining equipment for mine production, and explosion-proof electrical equipment required by open-pit coal mines, it is necessary to actively build new factories. In order to make the development of these factories adapt to the technical and quantitative needs of the coal industry, it is also necessary to strengthen the design force and scientific research work of equipment manufacturing, and the trial production of new products.

Actively develop local coal industry

Make it gradually take on the task of coal for industry, civilian use, and rural use in medium-sized and small towns.

Below I will talk about the issue of actively developing the local coal industry. China is a country with a vast territory and a large population. At present, wood and oil are very scarce, and civilian coal accounts for a large proportion of the total coal production. According to statistics over the years, it accounts for about 45% of the total coal production. In order to guarantee the needs of industry and transportation for coal, and to appropriately meet the needs of civilian coal, in addition to actively developing state-owned coal mines, it is also necessary to give play to the enthusiasm of the localities and actively develop the local coal industry. It is recommended that the Ministry of Coal Industry should concentrate its main efforts to guarantee the coal used by important industries in the future, and local coal mines should gradually take on the task of coal for industry, civilian use, and rural use in medium-sized and small towns.

In 1956, the output of local coal mines is expected to be 26.75 million tons, and it will have to bear a production task of more than 40 million tons in 1962. In order to complete this arduous task, local coal mines must strengthen leadership over existing mines, improve operation and management, carry out reconstruction with emphasis, and gradually improve existing technical equipment and labor conditions in order to increase their production capacity. At the same time, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, localities must also build new mines with an annual output of about 20 million tons. Only in this way can we guarantee the needs of national economic development for coal during the second and third five-year plans. At present, local coal mines have many difficulties. Therefore, in addition to providing necessary assistance from state-owned coal mines, it is recommended that the central government should include local coal mines' investment, equipment, materials, and the training and distribution of technical cadres in the national plan and solve them in order to encourage the enthusiasm of local coal mines in production and construction. Otherwise, difficulties in civilian coal will inevitably affect the development of industry and agriculture.

The above are important issues related to the development of China's coal industry. Because we lack experience, there are many shortcomings in our planning work. We must accept past experience, improve the level of planning work, and correctly formulate the coal industry plan for the Second Five-Year Plan.

In the process of implementing the First Five-Year Plan, we also have serious shortcomings in production and capital construction. The most prominent ones are low product and engineering quality, many accidents, and insufficient solutions to employees' living and welfare facilities. This is inseparable from our leadership's bureaucracy. In the future, we must strive to correct it.

According to the requirements of the Second Five-Year Plan, the tasks of the coal industry are very arduous. We must work hard to correct shortcomings, improve our work, and strive to overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan and actively prepare for the Second Five-Year Plan in accordance with the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Party.

    加强煤炭工业建设，满足国民经济需要
    煤炭工业部部长　陈郁同志的发言
    在第二个五年计划期间，我国的基本建设和工农业生产将继续保持比较快的发展速度。因此，必须加强煤炭工业的建设，保证工业、交通运输业有足够数量的煤炭，并适当满足城市和农村用煤。煤炭工业的建设任务是很繁重的。我现在想就有关煤炭工业远景计划问题，发表一些意见。
    在第一个五年计划的前四年，由于我们对原有矿井进行了生产改革和恢复、改建工作，提高了劳动生产率，发挥了原有矿井的潜力，因而满足了我国工业发展和民用煤的需要。一九五六年全国煤炭产量预计可以达到一亿零八百万吨，接近第一个五年计划一九五七年的生产水平。在提高原有矿井生产能力的同时，我们积极地进行了新矿井和新的煤炭工业基地的建设。截至一九五六年末，全国国营煤矿开工建设的新矿井，年生产能力将达到三千三百七十万吨，全国国营煤矿投入生产的新矿井（包括第一个五年计划以前开工的新矿井），年生产能力将达到一千六百二十五万吨。与此同时，地质、设计和施工的力量，从无到有，得到了很大的发展。现在，在苏联专家的帮助下，我们已经可以设计和建设大型矿井。煤炭工业的发展同需要不相适应
    第一个五年计划规定的煤炭生产指标虽然可以超额完成，但仍不能满足一九五七年和第二个五年计划期间对煤炭的需要
    全国煤炭产量，虽然可以超额完成第一个五年计划所规定的指标，但是在一九五七年还将会出现煤炭供不应求的紧张局面；更严重的是，第一个五年煤炭工业基本建设的规模与煤炭工业发展的要求不相适应，将不能满足第二个五年计划期内国民经济发展对煤炭的需要。为了完成党中央关于第二个五年计划的建议所给予煤炭工业的任务，必须吸取第一个五年计划执行过程中的经验，采取措施，争取超额地完成第一个五年计划所规定的基本建设任务，并做好第二个五年计划的准备工作。
    第一个五年计划，规定煤炭生产平均每年递增百分之十二，规定全国工业总产值平均每年递增百分之十四点七。根据一九五三年至一九五六年的统计和一九五七年的预计，全国工业总产值的发展速度是百分之十七左右。为了满足工业发展的需要，这就相应地要求煤炭生产的发展速度必须达到百分之十六左右。但是，预计只能达到百分之十三左右，一九五七年全国煤炭的产量只能达到一亿二千万吨左右。全国煤炭的需要量约一亿三千万吨左右，这就形成了煤炭供不应求的局面。以上情况说明了，在计划执行中，其他工业超计划的发展大于煤炭工业超计划的发展，这就加重了煤炭供应的紧张情况。
    第一个五年计划煤炭工业的基本建设规模必须有所增加，否则不仅影响着第一个五年计划期间煤炭的生产，更严重的是影响煤炭工业的远景发展，将无法保证第二个五年计划期内国民经济发展的需要。
    在第一个五年计划期间，煤炭的产量主要是依靠原有矿井生产的，一九五七年原有矿井的产量约占全部产量的百分之八十五。在第二个五年计划期间，情况就不同了，要满足对煤炭的需要，就要更多的依靠第一个和第二个五年计划期内新建的矿井。而新建矿井的产量决定于新矿井建设的规模和开工建设的时间。由于一个矿井的建成和达到它的设计生产能力所需要的时间是很长的，第一个五年计划期内建设的新矿井，到一九六二年，产量才能达到其生产能力的百分之八十五左右，而第二个五年计划期内建设的新矿井，到一九六二年产量仅能达到它的全部生产能力的百分之十至十五。因此第一个五年计划期内新矿井建设规模的大小，基本上决定着第二个五年计划期内煤炭工业生产增长的速度。由于第一个五年计划期内矿井的建设规模（年生产能力四千三百五十万吨）小了，一九六二年全国煤炭产量达到一亿九千万吨有很多的困难，这与一九六二年的需要量（二亿一千万至二亿二千万吨）比较，还相差很远。在发现这个严重问题之后，一九五五年曾经提出把国营煤矿的建设规模增加一千万吨左右，但因投资、材料和设备供应的困难，这一计划至今未能实现。而且第一个五年计划规定的矿井和选煤厂的建设任务，由于投资、材料和设备供应的限制，能否完成尚无保证。这对第二个五年计划期内国民经济的发展，特别是对钢铁工业所需炼焦煤的供应，将造成极为不利的影响。妥善安排一九五七年煤炭生产计划
    争取较原计划多建设能够生产数百万吨煤炭的矿井
    为了力争避免这种形势，妥善地安排一九五七年的煤炭生产计划和正确地编制第二个五年煤炭工业的发展计划，是十分重要的。
    一九五七年必须保证完成第一个五年计划规定的矿井和洗选厂的建设任务，还应该积极创造条件，争取较原计划多建设能够生产数百万吨煤炭的矿井。为此，就需要解决投资、设备和材料供应等方面的问题。对于煤矿建设极关重要的铁路、电源，也应相应地加以解决。特别希望在一九五八年的前半年，修通黄碾到博爱的铁路，包头到兰州的铁路修到石咀山矿区，这是保证武汉钢铁工业炼焦煤和保证西北新工业城市用煤的先决条件。正确编制第二个五年计划的煤炭
        工业发展计划
    必须使煤炭工业保有一定的后备生产能力，并建立国家对煤炭的储备制度
    在制定第二个五年计划时，必须周密地计算国民经济发展对煤炭的需要量，使煤炭工业生产水平的发展与我国国民经济发展对煤炭的需要量保持平衡。在计算煤炭需要量的时候，要充分考虑到其他工业超计划发展的可能性大于煤炭工业超计划发展的可能性。因此，在规定煤炭工业的生产水平时，必须保有一定的后备生产能力，并建立国家对煤炭的储备制度。在考虑到煤炭工业的建设规模时，必须使建设规模和对煤炭工业生产水平的要求相适应，特别是必须与第三个五年计划中对煤炭工业生产水平的发展要求相适应。同时，由于矿井的建设时间长，想用在年度计划中追加项目的办法，来解决已经形成的煤炭供不应求的极度紧张情况是不可能的。
    在煤炭工业建设中，煤矿机械制造工业的建设问题是很重要的。由于煤矿地下作业的特点，必须给以较多的机械设备，诸如矿井提升、排水、通风等机械设备是必不可少的，井下作业的条件困难、劳动繁重，必须切实有步骤地大力推行笨重劳动的机械化，这就需要大量的采掘、装载、搬运、抓岩等机械设备；井下作业是在经常与自然条件的变化和自然灾害——水、火、瓦斯、煤尘不断地斗争中进行的，必须切实注意安全和劳动保护工作，这就需要防爆的电气设备、安全救护设备和仪器。在第一个五年计划期间，由于我们对这件工作重视不够，因而，经常由于设备供应问题影响了生产技术的改进和基本建设的进度。在第二个五年计划期间煤矿需要的设备数量将比第一个五年计划时期有很大的增加，约有190万吨左右，过去依靠国外进口的设备，将要更多地由国内生产来解决。因此，必须积极地加强矿山设备制造的建设工作，否则完成这一个巨大规模的建设任务、提高煤矿劳动生产率、改进安全生产的情况以及改善劳动条件等将成为不可能的事情。我国目前对煤矿设备的制造不是完全没有基础的，而问题是在于把现在全国已经具备一定经验为煤矿制造设备的工厂专业化起来，发挥它们制造煤矿设备的潜力，专门为煤矿服务。对于急需的而当前又是没有的如露天煤矿所需要的大型电铲、电机车、矿井生产用的采掘设备、防爆电气设备等，则需要积极的建设新厂。为了使这些工厂的发展与煤炭工业在技术上和数量上的需要相适应，还必须加强设备制造的设计力量和科学研究工作，和新产品的试制工作。积极发展地方煤炭工业
    使它逐渐担负起中、小城镇的工业、民用和农村用煤的任务下边我谈一下积极发展地方煤炭工业的问题。我国是一个地广人多的国家，目前木材和石油又很缺乏，民用煤在全部煤炭产量中所占的比重很大，根据历年统计，约占全部煤炭产量的百分之四十五左右。为了保证工业和交通运输业对煤炭的需要，和适当满足民用煤的需要，除了积极发展国营煤矿以外，还必须发挥地方的积极性，积极地发展地方煤炭工业。建议今后煤炭工业部应该集中主要力量保证重要工业的用煤，地方煤矿应该逐渐担负起中、小城镇的工业、民用和农村用煤的任务。
    一九五六年，地方煤矿的产量预计为二千六百七十五万吨，一九六二年将要负担四千万吨以上的生产任务。为了完成这一繁重的任务，地方煤矿就必须对现有矿井加强领导，改善经营管理，有重点地进行改建，并逐步改善现有技术装备和劳动条件，以提高其生产能力。同时，在第二个五年计划期内，地方还必须建设年产二千万吨左右的新矿井。这样才能保证第二个和第三个五年计划期内国民经济发展对煤炭的需要。目前地方煤矿的困难是很多的，因此，除了国营煤矿给以必要的协助外，建议中央对地方煤矿的投资、设备材料和技术干部的培养、分配等，都应纳入国家计划，加以解决，以鼓励地方煤矿生产建设的积极性。否则，民用煤发生困难，也必将影响工业和农业的发展。
    以上是关系着我国煤炭工业发展的重要问题。由于我们缺乏经验，就在计划工作中存在着很多缺点，我们必须接受以往的经验，提高计划工作的水平，正确地编制第二个五年的煤炭工业计划。
    在第一个五年计划执行过程中，我们在生产和基本建设上也存在着严重的缺点，最突出的是产品和工程质量低，事故多，以及对职工生活福利设施解决的不够，这是和我们领导上的官僚主义分不开的。今后，必须努力改正。
    根据第二个五年计划的要求，煤炭工业的任务是很艰巨的，我们一定根据党的第八次全国代表大会的精神，努力纠正缺点，改进工作，为超额完成第一个五年计划和积极地做好第二个五年计划的准备工作而奋斗。
