    Hoping to Change the Chaotic Situation at Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering
    We are students from the Civil Engineering Department of the former Sunan Industrial School, and we came to study at Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering after the departmental adjustments this summer. We have encountered many difficulties in our studies and lives.
    We are about to graduate. This final year of study is very important to us. However, the school leaders do not pay attention to teaching work, and they have transferred teachers from the water supply and drainage major to teach reinforced concrete structure. Some courses have no teachers, so we have to do design work first. Can such a reversal of the teaching plan achieve good teaching results? Some teachers speak in local dialects during lectures, and we cannot understand them at all. In addition, the teaching instruments are dilapidated, and there are no desks in class. How can we study well with such learning conditions?
    There are even more difficulties in life. The entire institute has nearly three thousand students, but they are crowded into a dining hall that can only accommodate one thousand people for meals, and you have to queue to drink boiled water. Many students suffer from gastrointestinal diseases, and the school clinic emphasizes the difficulty in buying medicine and does not provide treatment. The school has not yet built toilets, and everyone has to go from the building to the construction site to use the toilet, regardless of whether it is windy or rainy.
    We have raised our concerns to the relevant departments, but have not received any response. We are raising it again, hoping that the relevant departments will pay attention to the problems in our school and find ways to solve them.

    希望改变西安建筑工程学院的混乱现象
    我们是原苏南工业专科学校土木系的学生，今年暑假院系调整后，到西安建筑工程学院学习。我们在学习和生活上遇到了许多困难。
    我们就要毕业了。最后一年的学习，对我们是非常重要的。但是，学校领导上却不重视教学工作，把给水排水专业的教师调来教钢筋混凝土结构学。有些课程没有教师，只好先做设计。这样颠倒教学计划，能收到好的教学效果吗？有些教师讲课时说家乡土话，我们一点也听不懂。另外，教学仪器破烂不堪，上课时没有桌子。这样的学习条件，如何搞好学习呢？
    在生活上的困难更多，全院有近三千学生，却挤在仅容一千人的饭厅里吃饭，喝开水也要排队。有许多同学患肠胃病，学校卫生所强调买药困难，不给治疗。学校直到现在没有盖好厕所，无论刮风下雨，大家都要从楼上到工地去上厕所。
    我们曾向有关方面提过意见，都没有得到回音。我们再一次提出，希望有关方面，重视我们学校中的问题，并想办法解决。
