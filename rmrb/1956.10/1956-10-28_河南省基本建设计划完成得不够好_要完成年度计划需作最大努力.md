According to the Henan Daily, the plan completion situation in Henan Province's industry, transportation, and postal and telecommunications sectors in the third quarter of this year was generally good, but basic construction was not completed well enough.

In terms of industrial production, according to statistics from 304 large industrial enterprises, the total output value exceeded the third quarter plan by 4.6%. As of the end of September, the cumulative completion of the annual plan was 73.33%, an increase of 41.89% compared with the same period last year. State-owned industries completed the plan better in the third quarter, while local industries were worse, mainly due to heavy rainfall in the third quarter of this year, which caused water in many coal mines and collapse of brick kilns, resulting in production stoppages or partial stoppages. Some products were also forced to stop or reduce production due to insufficient supply of raw materials or inability to sell them. These greatly affected the better completion of the third quarter production plan.

The basic construction plan was not completed well enough in the third quarter. The total investment in state-owned and local state-owned construction in Henan Province only completed 63.6% of the quarterly plan. The cumulative completion from January to September was only 44.4% of the annual plan, which is less than half of the annual plan. The main reason for the poor completion of the plan is the insufficient supply of building materials. Although some materials can meet the needs, they could not be delivered in time due to heavy transportation tasks; another reason is that some departments do not have a sufficient understanding of the "more, faster, better, and more economical" policy. After criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking, there was a rush for quick results and the plans were drafted too large, which made some of the plans divorced from reality and greatly affected the completion of the basic construction plan. The fourth quarter is the busiest season for basic construction tasks. To ensure that more than 50% of the annual task is completed in a short period of three months, effective measures must be taken to complete civil engineering projects as soon as possible, accelerate construction and installation projects, and do a good job in other finishing work.

### 河南省基本建设计划完成得不够好  要完成年度计划需作最大努力

    河南省基本建设计划完成得不够好
    要完成年度计划需作最大努力
    据河南日报讯　今年第三季度，河南省工业、交通运输和邮电方面的计划完成情况，基本良好，基本建设却完成得不够好。
    在工业生产方面，据三百零四个大型工业企业的统计，总产值超额完成第三季度计划的4.6％。截至9月底，累计完成年计划73.33％，比去年同期增长了41.89％。第三季度国营工业完成计划较好，地方工业则较差，主要原因是：今年第三季度雨水较大，不少煤矿出水，砖瓦窑倒塌，以致使产品停产或部分停产。也有些产品是因为原材料供应不上或推销不出而被迫停产或减产。这都大大地影响了第三季度生产计划的更好完成。
    第三季度基本建设计划完成的不够好。河南省全部国营、地方国营建设总投资仅完成季计划的63.6％。1至9月份累计仅完成年计划的44.4％，还不到年计划的一半。计划完成得不好的主要原因是建筑材料供应不足。有些材料虽然可以满足需要，但因交通运输任务繁重，未能及时运达；另一个原因是有些部门对“又多、又快、又好、又省”的方针认识不足，在批判右倾保守思想以后，又出现了急躁情绪，计划编制得偏大，使部分计划脱离实际，大大影响了基本建设计划的完成。第四季度是基本建设任务最繁重的一季。要保证在短短的三个月的时间，完成全年任务的50％以上，必须采取有效措施，及早完成土建工程，加速进行建筑安装工程和作好其他结尾工作。
