Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 14th: Vice Premier Chen Yi's speech at the banquet hosted by Governor Tao Zhu in honor of President Sukarno on the evening of the 13th. The full text is as follows:

Your Excellency President Sukarno, Ladies and Gentlemen, Comrades:

	Present at the banquet tonight are all the distinguished Indonesian guests accompanying President Sukarno on his visit to China, the Indonesian Women's Delegation, diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in Guangzhou, and foreign and Chinese journalists. We extend a warm welcome to you, Mr. President, and all the guests for attending our banquet.

	I accepted the task assigned to me by Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai to accompany President Sukarno and the distinguished Indonesian guests on visits to various parts of China, from the northeast to the central and southern regions. In another day or two, the distinguished guests will depart China, and my task of accompanying them will be completed.

	We were deeply moved by President Sukarno's speech at this farewell banquet just now. Therefore, I personally would like to say a few words here.

	President Sukarno is the leader of the Indonesian people and the Supreme Commander of the Indonesian Republic's Armed Forces. Through decades of democratic revolutionary struggle, he put forward the Pancasila doctrine, the Five Principles. President Sukarno has explained his Five Principles in many speeches in China, which are a good combination of the ideas of advanced figures from various countries and the national characteristics of Indonesia, with the aim of serving Indonesia's national independence. The Chinese people fully understand President Sukarno's spirit. This spirit enables President Sukarno to have full sympathy for the independence achieved by the Chinese nation and the construction of New China, both before and after his visit to China, which is entirely understandable.

	I remember that the day before yesterday, when visiting Nanjing, President Sukarno first visited Dr. Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum immediately after getting off the plane, presented a wreath to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's portrait, and asked in detail about all aspects of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's life. President Sukarno prayed in front of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's stone coffin. I personally expressed my heartfelt gratitude at that time for this sincere spirit and respect for the great Dr. Sun Yat-sen. I believe the Chinese people will also thank him in the same way.

	Of course, some people may be jealous of the daily consolidation and development of friendship between China and Indonesia. These people may suggest that since there are ideological differences between us, this friendship is deliberately contrived to provoke discord. Indeed, there are differences in ideology between countries in the world, and there are also differences in national systems. For each individual, there are indeed different views on the world and the universe, and so on. Each nation has its own characteristics. Attempts to impose one type on the heads of all nations are typical manifestations of colonialism, and of course, will be opposed by the people of the world!

	In China, in the fields of academics and literature and art, we have put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." In the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and various democratic parties, we have put forward the policy of "Long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." The Chinese people know that ideologies are diverse and cannot be completely unified. There is an old Chinese saying, "People's hearts are different, just like their faces." This sentence is very true. If individuals are like this, how much more so are nations and countries.

	The great Indonesian nation and the great Chinese nation naturally have their own national characteristics and their own favorite lifestyles, which cannot be completely the same, including ideology. This is a matter of common sense.

	However, why are some people so interested in sowing discord here? The main reason is that colonialists are sowing discord. They are very jealous of the friendship between China and Indonesia. As His Excellency President Sukarno has repeatedly revealed, he said that the majority of people in the world oppose the enslavement of colonialism and oppose the aggression and oppression of imperialism. This is the common demand of the people of the world, and it is entirely possible to achieve consensus.

	Speaking as a Chinese citizen, although there are ideological differences between myself and His Excellency President Sukarno, I fully support His Excellency President Sukarno in our common interests and the common interests of opposing colonialism.

	In my two weeks of contact with President Sukarno, I have seen President Sukarno's democratic spirit. His mention of democracy is guided democracy. In his speeches in China, President Sukarno has repeatedly mentioned that he is the son of the Indonesian people, a member of the Indonesian people's struggle for independence, and has repeatedly mentioned his predecessors in the Indonesian liberation struggle, and Vice President Mohammad Hatta of Indonesia. This specifically illustrates that the meaning of his guided democracy is to put the people and the nation first, to place himself among the masses of the people, and not to forget his comrades and comrades-in-arms. I personally express my great admiration for this, and I believe that all friends and comrades present will also express admiration like me.

	We have heard that the Chinese government intends to invite Vice President Hatta to visit China. If Vice President Hatta expresses his willingness, we warmly welcome him to visit China.

	His Excellency President Sukarno bears a major responsibility to the Indonesian nation and also bears a great responsibility to the unity of Asian and African countries. Although the two weeks of visiting China is very short, it is a long time for such a political figure to spend so much time. President Sukarno loves young people and children very much, and seizes every opportunity to talk with young people and children. He has mentioned more than once that the future of the world is in the hands of young people. This is a great vision of a statesman. On behalf of the Chinese youth and children, I would like to express my gratitude to President Sukarno.

	President Sukarno obtained a bachelor's degree in engineering from Bandung University decades ago. He is very interested in the architecture of the Summer Palace and Tiananmen Square in Beijing, the basic construction of Anshan Iron and Steel in the Northeast, and the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. He also discussed with experts when visiting the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. He mentioned in his speech that he used to be a bridge engineer. His visit to China this time is to build a bridge of friendship between the two countries. Now I raise my glass to wish the great friendship bridge engineer, His Excellency President Sukarno, good health.

	There is an Indonesian proverb that says: "The eyes see as far away, but the hearts are very close." This is a very good saying. Let me borrow it as our farewell message to you. Our separation will make our friendship even stronger. Goodbye, and I wish Mr. President and the distinguished guests a safe journey!

    陈毅副总理的讲话
    新华社广州14日电　陈毅副总理13日晚上在陶铸省长招待苏加诺总统宴会上的讲话。全文如下：
    苏加诺总统阁下、女士们、先生们、同志们：
    今天晚上参加宴会的，有随苏加诺总统来中国访问的印度尼西亚的全体贵宾、印度尼西亚妇女代表团、各国驻广州的外交官员和外国和中国的记者们。我们对于你、总统阁下、和全体来宾出席我们的宴会表示热烈的欢迎。
    我接受毛泽东主席和周恩来总理交给我的任务，陪同苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚的贵宾们参观中国各地，从东北部到中部、南部，再过一两天，贵宾们别离中国，我陪送的任务就完成了。
    刚才听了苏加诺总统在这个送别宴会上的讲话，我们深受感动。因此，我个人想在这里讲几句话。
    苏加诺总统是印度尼西亚人民的领袖，同时是印度尼西亚共和国武装部队的最高统帅，经过了几十年民主革命斗争的锻炼，他提出了五基学说即潘查希拉的学说。苏加诺总统在中国的多次演说中都解释他的五基学说，是把世界各国先进人物的思想和印度尼西亚的民族特点很好的结合起来，其目的在于为印度尼西亚的民族独立服务。中国人民完全了解苏加诺总统的这种精神。这种精神使苏加诺总统在来中国参观前和在中国参观后，对中国民族取得独立和新中国的建设具有充分的同情，是完全可以理解的。
    记得前天在访问南京的时候，苏加诺总统一下飞机后，就首先去拜访孙中山先生灵墓，向孙中山先生遗像献花圈，对孙中山先生的生平的各方面问得很详细。苏加诺总统在孙中山先生的石棺前作了祈祷。这种诚挚的精神和对伟大的孙中山先生的崇敬，我个人当时表示了由衷的感谢。我相信中国人民也会同样感谢他的。
    当然，可能有人对中国和印度尼西亚两国的友谊一天天巩固和发展表现嫉妒，这些人可能提出我们之间既然存在着意识形态的不同，因而这种友谊是故意做作的来进行挑拨。对的，世界各国之间确实存在着意识形态的不同，也存在各国国家制度的不同。就每个人来说，也确实存在着对世界对宇宙的看法各有不同等等，各民族各有自己的特点，企图用一种类型套用在一切民族头上去塑造，这些典型的殖民主义的表现形式，当然是要遭着全世界人民的反对的！
    在我们中国，在学术和文学艺术方面提出了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，在中国共产党同各民主党派关系方面提出“长期共存，互相监督”的方针。中国人民知道思想意识是各样各色的，不可能完全统一起来。中国有句老话“人心不同，各如其面”，这句话很对，个人既然如此，何况各个民族和各个国家。
    伟大的印度尼西亚民族和伟大的中国民族当然各有其民族特点，各有其自己喜爱的生活方式，不可能完全一样，包括意识形态在内，这是一个常识问题。
    但是，为什么有些人很有兴趣的在这里进行挑拨呢，这其中最主要的是殖民主义者在进行挑拨，他们对中国和印度尼西亚的友谊十分嫉妒，正如苏加诺总统阁下所一再揭露的，他说，全世界大多数人民反对殖民主义的奴役，反对帝国主义的侵略和压迫，这是世界人民的共同的要求，这完全是可以取得一致的。
    我以一个中国公民的资格发言，虽然我与苏加诺总统阁下存在着意识形态的不同，但在为了我们两国的共同的利益及反对殖民主义的共同利益，在这一点上，我完全支持苏加诺总统阁下。
    我在两个星期同苏加诺总统的接触中，我看到苏加诺总统的民主精神。他的对民主的提法是有领导的民主，苏加诺总统在中国的各次演说中，一再提到他是印度尼西亚人民的儿子，是印度尼西亚人民独立斗争中的一个成员，多次提到印度尼西亚解放斗争的他的先辈，提到印度尼西亚穆罕默德·哈达副总统。这具体说明了他的有领导的民主的含意是把人民和民族放到第一位，把自己放在人民大众中间，没有忘记他的同志和战友，这一点我个人表示非常钦佩，我相信在座的各位朋友各位同志也一定和我一样表示钦佩。
    我们听说，中国政府打算邀请哈达副总统来中国访问，如果哈达副总统表示愿意的话，我们在这里热烈欢迎他来中国访问。
    苏加诺总统阁下，对印度尼西亚国家负有重大责任，对亚非各国团结也负有很大的责任。在中国访问两周的时间虽然很短，但像这样的政治人物能花这么多的时间，已经是很长的了，苏加诺总统非常热爱青年和儿童，到处争取机会与青年们儿童们进行谈话，他不止一次的讲到世界的未来掌握在青年人手里，这是政治家的极大的远见。我代表中国青年和儿童向苏加诺总统表示感谢。
    苏加诺总统在几十年前在万隆大学取得了工程学士学位，他对北京的颐和园、天安门，东北的鞍钢基本建设的建筑，武汉长江大桥，都很感兴趣。参观武汉长江大桥时，并和专家们进行了讨论。他在讲话中曾提到过他曾经是一个桥梁工程师。他这次来中国是建立两国友谊的桥梁。现在我举杯祝这位伟大的友谊桥梁工程师苏加诺总统阁下的身体健康。
    印度尼西亚人民有一句成语说：“眼睛看来像很远，而心里却靠得很近”。这是一句非常好的话。让我借来做为我们与你们之间的告别辞，我们的分别使我们的友谊更
  加深厚起来，再见，祝总统阁下与贵宾一路福星！
