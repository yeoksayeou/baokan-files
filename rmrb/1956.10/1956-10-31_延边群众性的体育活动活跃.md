Xinhua News Agency, Yanji, October 30th. The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, with a population of 770,000, has already had more than 740 amateur athletes participate in sports competitions in Jilin Province and throughout the country this year. Amateur football and men's and women's volleyball teams here often hold friendly matches with first-class teams from major cities in the country.

　　The cold air from Changbai Mountain has caused many pedestrians to change into winter clothes, but outdoor activities for sports enthusiasts are still ongoing. On holidays, all the stadiums in Yanji City are crowded. Counties and towns throughout the prefecture are conducting the first Labor and Defense System tests to summarize the achievements of mass physical exercise this year. Within a month before the test, more than 3,380 male and female workers and government cadres have been awarded Labor and Defense System Level 1 and Level 2 badges.

　　This year, the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture has organized mass sports activities in a planned way. At present, there are 291 grassroots sports associations throughout the prefecture, including the vast majority of amateur sports enthusiasts from enterprises, government agencies, and schools. A month ago, a youth amateur sports school was established in Yanji City. This year, the prefecture holds an average of one and a half prefecture-wide or county- and city-level sports competitions every week, more than in any previous year.

　　In nearly a year, the autonomous prefecture has cultivated 149 national-level athletes, 169 national-level referees, and one cyclist who broke the national record through daily exercise and sports competitions.

    延边群众性的体育活动活跃
    新华社延吉30日电　拥有七十七万人口的延边朝鲜族自治州，今年已经有七百四十多名业余体育运动员参加了吉林省和全国性的体育运动竞赛。这里的业余足球和男女排球等球队常和国内大城市第一流球队进行友谊比赛活动。
    长白山下的冷空气已使许多行人都换上冬装，可是体育爱好者们的户外活动仍在继续进行。在休假日，延吉市所有的体育场都很拥挤。州内各县市镇正在进行第一次劳卫制测验，总结今年群众体育锻炼的成果。在测验前一个月内，已有三千三百八十多名男女工人和机关干部佩带了劳卫制一、二级证章。
    今年，延边朝鲜族自治州有组织地开展了群众体育活动。目前全州有二百九十一个基层体育协会，包括了绝大部分企业、机关和学校的业余体育爱好者。一个月前，延吉市又成立一所青少年业余体育学校。今年全州每星期平均举行一次半全州性或县、市级体育比赛，比赛的次数比过去任何一年都要多。
    将近一年来，自治州从日常锻炼和体育竞赛中培养了一百四十九名国家等级运动员、一百六十九名国家等级裁判员和一名打破全国纪录的自行车运动员。
