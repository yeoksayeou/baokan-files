Gansu's Industry is Advancing Rapidly
By Our Correspondent Kang Weizhong

Gansu, once considered "industrially backward and inconveniently located," is undergoing transformation. Here, where many towns had never seen machines, batches of small and medium-sized factories have been established, their towering chimneys emitting black smoke. On the railways and highways winding through mountain valleys and barren beaches, trains and cars, like dragons swimming in water, like leaping lions, drag long tails, roaring and speeding by. In towns, at stations, on construction sites, one often encounters young men and women from afar, their faces tanned by the sun. Speaking in various dialects, they enthusiastically discuss the prospects of construction. At the foot of the snow-capped Qilian Mountains, on the green grasslands of the Helan Mountains, and at the foot of the barren Long Mountains, groups of "treasure hunters," braving the cold and heat, carrying knapsacks and instruments, run back and forth, planting red flags and markers wherever they go. In these remote wildernesses and Gobi deserts, some places have now become extremely busy construction sites. There, bulldozers, scrapers, and excavators roar day and night, and trucks transporting building materials race at high speed.

As early as 1870, Gansu established the Foreign Gun Bureau (manufacturing guns, the predecessor of the current Lanzhou General Machinery Plant), and in 1877, Zuo Zongtang established a woolen cloth bureau here (which ceased operation before liberation). These industries were established under the policy of "promoting foreign affairs." However, before liberation, due to the dominance of the feudal economy and traffic congestion, they did not develop. In 1949, the factories taken over by the People's Government, apart from the more significant Yumen Oil Mine, Lanzhou Power Plant, Lanzhou No. 2 Flour Mill, and Lanzhou General Machinery Plant, were mostly small enterprises with simple equipment and heavy debts. The total value of industrial production in the province was only 33 million yuan, equivalent to the production value of a larger factory in Shanghai!

Gansu's industry has developed on such a dilapidated foundation since liberation. According to statistics by the end of June this year, the number of relatively large-scale enterprises in the province has reached 118, an increase of nearly four times. The total value of industrial production in the province in 1955 also increased by 5.5 times. The proportion of modern industry has also increased from 44.72% in 1949 to 60% in 1955; the proportion of the province's total industrial output value to the total value of industrial and agricultural output has increased from 2.15% in 1949 to 11.12% in 1955.

In the remote villages of the Hexi Corridor, in the mountainous areas of Linxia and Wudu, and in the flat and boundless Yinchuan area known as "the Jiangnan of the Frontier," although there were wide fields and neatly decorated terraces, large double-wheeled double-furrow plows and mountain step plows could have been used. However, due to the small amount produced in the province and the reliance on transfers from other provinces, the cost was high and the price was expensive, so few people used these agricultural implements. In recent years, after expansion and new construction, agricultural machinery manufacturing plants in Lanzhou, Tianshui, and Wuwei have been or will soon be put into production, producing hundreds of thousands of new agricultural implements annually to supply the countryside. In the mountainous rural areas, almost every household burned cattle and horse dung, which had a strong odor. Now, seven coal mines have been newly built and expanded in Wuwei, Wudu, and Guyuan, partially solving the fuel and fertilizer problems in these areas and strongly supporting agricultural production increases. In Gaolan County, a mountainous rural area, the province's first hydroelectric power station has been built. The electricity output illuminates remote mountain villages; the water flowing out irrigates tens of thousands of acres of land.

In the early days of liberation, the province had only one railway from Baoji to Tianshui, and the poor roadbed was well-known throughout the country. It was impassable five out of ten days. People said it was: "Bao-Tian Road, a mess, either landslides or derailments." There were very few roads, and the most common means of transportation for going out or traveling were livestock and sedan chairs (carried by two people). Now the Bao-Tian Railway has been rebuilt (and is still being rebuilt), and the quality has improved. The Tian-Lan Railway has long been open to traffic. The Lan-Xin Railway was opened to traffic on July 1 to the Yumen Oil Mine, more than 800 kilometers away from Lanzhou. The Bao-Lan Railway is under intense construction and will be open to traffic by the end of the year to Dijiatai, more than 80 kilometers away from Lanzhou. The Lan-Qing Railway will soon begin construction. Before long, a railway hub centered on Lanzhou will be formed, which will closely link Gansu with all parts of the country. Roads in the province extend in all directions, and even the most remote and desolate minority areas—Subei Mongolian Autonomous County, Sunan Yugur Autonomous County, Aksai Kazakh Autonomous County, and Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture—have roads and access to automobiles. The closed transportation situation in Gansu in the past has been greatly changed, and the connection between urban and rural areas, between ethnic minorities, and the exchange of materials between regions is much more convenient than in the past.

During the First Five-Year Plan, several projects from the 156 projects designed by the Soviet Union to help China were placed in Gansu; at the same time, it is also planned to build a number of relatively large-scale factories and mines, mainly heavy industry, in Gansu during the Second Five-Year Plan and the initial stage of the Third Five-Year Plan. This is an inspiring industrial construction plan. In order to complete these construction tasks, tens of thousands of geological workers, unafraid of high mountains and deep valleys, fearless of cold winds and heavy snow, have erected drilling rigs in the deep mountains and wilderness, waving red flags on the Gobi Desert, and leaving footprints in the muddy snow. They are using heroic labor to find very important mineral resources for the country. The mineral deposits that have now been preliminarily proven are: in the Qilian Mountains, there are large-scale, high-quality iron ore deposits; in the Mazong Mountains, there are large-scale lead-zinc ore deposits; in Shizuishan north of Yinchuan, there are large-scale coal mines; other copper, tungsten, antimony, chromium, manganese, barite, apatite, oil shale, sulfur and other mines have also been discovered. This provides sufficient resources for the development of heavy industry. The development and utilization of these resources will fundamentally change the backward face of Gansu's industry and bring a happier life to the people of Gansu!

In Lanzhou, a huge petroleum machinery plant is under construction. After this factory is completed, it will produce a large number of complete sets of new drilling equipment, etc., to meet the needs of the rapid development of the country's petroleum exploration. Now, the factory has completed several dormitory buildings, which can accommodate a large number of technical, construction and management personnel, creating conditions for large-scale construction. China's largest oil refinery is also under active construction in Lanzhou. The total area of ​​the factory area is larger than the old city of Lanzhou; the underground oil pipelines in the factory area are connected one by one, totaling 700 kilometers long, which can be laid from Lanzhou to Xi'an. It is a highly mechanized oil refinery, and workers rely on instruments in the duty room to perform remote operations. After some workshops are put into production next year, they can refine part of the crude oil from the Yumen Oil Mine. The massive Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant is also under intense construction. The main building of this thermal power plant is a tall building. After the thermal power plant is completed, it will not only supply Lanzhou with cheap electricity for many newly built factories, but also provide sufficient steam and heating hot water required for industrial use. Mining local coal deposits is also of great significance for industrial construction. In addition to a large amount of investment by the state to rebuild the Aganzhen and Shmengou coal mines to increase the existing output, it has also decided to mine the Shanddan coal mine, which has considerable reserves and particularly good coal quality. After the two pairs of shafts of this mine are completed early next year, the annual output will be several times more than the current Ayu town coal mine. All of this has clearly shown the people of Gansu a beautiful picture, that is, Gansu will be transformed from an economically backward region into one of the country's new industrial bases.

    甘肃工业在迅速前进中
    本报记者　康伟中
    一向被人认为“工业落后，交通不便”的甘肃，正在发生变化。这里，过去许多城镇连机器都未见过，现在成批的中小工厂已经建立起来了，兀立着的烟囱滚滚地冒出黑烟。在蜿蜒在山坳和荒滩上的铁路和公路上，一列列的火车和一辆辆的汽车，像浮游在水里的蛟龙，像暴跳的狮子，拖着一条长长的尾巴，吼叫着疾驰而过。在城镇，在车站，在工地上，时常遇到来自远方、被太阳晒得面孔黝黑的男女青年。他们说着各地方言，兴致勃勃地谈着建设远景。在白雪皑皑的祁连山麓，在绿草如茵的贺兰山巅，在光秃秃的陇山脚下，成群的“探宝”工作者，冒着严寒和酷暑，背着行囊和仪器，跑来跑去，在足迹所到之处，插上了红旗和标桩。就在这人迹罕到的荒野和戈壁滩上，有的地方现在已成为十分繁忙的建设工地。在那里，推土机、铲运机、挖土机日夜轰鸣着，运输建筑材料的汽车在飞快地奔驰……。
    远在1870年甘肃就设立了洋炮局（制造枪炮，即现在的兰州通用机器厂的前身），1877年左宗棠在这里设立了制呢局（解放前停工）。这些工业是在“提倡洋务”的政策下建立起来的。但是，在解放以前，由于封建经济的统治和交通的阻塞，都没有得到发展。1949年，人民政府接收过来的工厂，除了玉门油矿、兰州电厂、兰州二面粉厂、兰州通用机器厂等较具规模而外，其余十多个厂矿均是一些设备简陋、负债累累的小企业。全省工业生产总值仅有三千三百万元，相当于上海一个较大厂子的生产总值那么多！
    解放后的甘肃工业，就是在这样一个破烂不堪的基础上发展起来的。到今年6月底统计，全省稍具规模的企业单位已有一百一十八个，增加了将近四倍；1955年全省工业生产总值，也增长了五点五倍。现代工业的比重，也由1949年的44.72％上升到1955年的60％；全省工业总产值占工农业总产值的比重已由1949年的2.15％上升为1955年的11，12％。
    过去，在交通不便的河西走廊偏僻的乡村里，在山脉纵横的临夏、武都山区里，在平坦无垠号称“塞上江南”的银川地区，虽有宽广的田野和修饰得整齐的梯田，本可以采用大型的双轮双铧犁和山地步犁，可是，由于本省生产的少，依靠外省调运，成本高，价格贵，使用这种农具的就很少。这几年，经过扩建和新建，兰州、天水、武威等地的农具制造厂已经或即将投入生产，每年生产数十万部新式农具供应到农村。过去的山区农村，几乎家家户户都烧牛、马粪，气味很大。现在武威、武都和固原等地新建和扩建了七个煤矿，部分地解决了这些地区的燃料和肥料问题，有力地支持了农业增产。在山区农村的皋兰县——全省第一座水力发电站已经建成了，从那里输出的电，照亮了偏僻的山村；从那里流出的水，灌溉了成千上万亩土地。
    在解放初期，全省仅仅有从宝鸡到天水的一条铁路，路基之坏是全国闻名的，十天有五天不能通车，人们说它是：“宝天路，瞎胡闹，不是塌方就掉道”。公路也很少，出门或旅行，最常用的交通工具是牲口、滑杆（两人抬）。现在宝天铁路经过改建（现在还在继续改建），质量改善了；天兰铁路早就通车了；兰新铁路于7月1日已经通车到距离兰州八百多公里的玉门油矿。包兰铁路正在紧张施工，年底可通车到距离兰州八十多公里的狄家台。兰青铁路即将动工兴建。不要很久，以兰州为中心的铁路枢纽就要形成，它将使甘肃与全国各地紧密地联结起来。全省公路四通八达，连最偏僻、最荒凉的少数民族地区——肃北蒙古族自治县、肃南裕固族自治县、阿克塞哈萨克自治县、甘南藏族自治州都修了公路，通了汽车。过去甘肃交通闭塞的情况大大改变了，城乡间、少数民族间的联系，地区间的物资交流较之过去也便利得多了。
    在第一个五年计划期间，苏联帮助我国设计的一百五十六项工程中的若干项目，放在了甘肃；同时，还准备在第二个五年计划和第三个五年计划的初期，再在甘肃建设一批规模比较大，并且以重工业为主的工厂矿山。这是一个鼓舞人心的工业建设规划。为着完成这些建设任务，成千上万的地质工作者，不怕山大沟深，不畏寒风大雪在深山旷野中架起了钻机，在戈壁滩上挥动着红旗，在泥泞雪地里踏下了脚印。他们正以英雄豪迈的劳动，给国家寻找十分重要的矿藏资源。现在已经初步探明的矿藏：在祁连山有大型的、质量良好的铁矿，在马鬃山有大型的铅锌矿，在银川以北石咀山有大型煤矿，其他铜、钨、锑、铬、锰、重晶石、磷灰石、油页岩、硫黄等矿，也均有发现。这就给发展重工业提供了充分的资源。这些资源的开发和利用，将使甘肃工业落后面貌发生根本变化，将给甘肃人民带来更幸福的生活！
    在兰州，一座规模巨大的石油机械厂正在修建。这个工厂建成后，将大量生产成套的新式钻探设备等，供应祖国石油勘探事业迅速发展的需要。现在，这个厂已经完成了数幢宿舍大楼工程，可供大批技术、施工和管理人员居住，为展开大规模施工创造了条件。我国规模最大的炼油厂也在兰州积极修建。这个厂的厂区总面积比兰州市的旧城还要大；厂区地下的输油管线，一根一根地接起来，足有七百公里长，可以从兰州铺到西安。它是一座高度机械化的炼油厂，工人们在值班室里依靠仪表进行远距离操作。明年部分车间投入生产后，即可炼制玉门油矿一部分原油。规模巨大的兰州热电站也正在紧张施工中。这个热电站的主厂房是一座高大的楼房，这个热电站建成后，不仅能供给兰州许多新建工厂的廉价的电力，而且还能供给工业上需用的充足的蒸汽和取暖热水。采掘当地煤藏，对于工业建设也具有十分重要意义，国家除大量投资、改建阿干镇、石门沟煤矿，提高现有产量外，还决定开采蕴藏量相当丰富、煤质特别好的山丹煤矿。明年初这个矿的两对矿井建成后，每年生产量将比现在的阿于镇煤矿多数倍。这一切已经清楚地在甘肃人民面前显示出一幅美丽的图画，这就是甘肃将要由一个经济落后地区，一跃而为祖国新的工业基地之一。
