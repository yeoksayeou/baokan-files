Xinhua News Agency, Blackpool, 3rd October: At the British Labour Party annual conference on the morning of October 2nd, Aneurin Bevan, the leader of the left wing of the Labour Party, was elected as the Labour Party Treasurer – the second most important position within the party – amidst enthusiastic cheers. Bevan received 3,029,000 votes, while George Brown, the former minister who competed against him and was supported by right-wing Labour figures, received 2,755,000 votes.

Bevan's victory concludes his three-year campaign for the position of treasurer. Many believe that this is not only a personal victory for him, but also the result of an increasing demand from lower-level Labour Party members for the party to adopt a more enlightened policy.

Bevan had previously competed with the current leader of the British Labour Party, Gaitskell, who was supported by right-wing trade union leaders, for the position of Labour Party treasurer, but was unsuccessful. This time, Bevan not only received support from local Labour Party organizations, but also from some trade unions such as the National Union of Mineworkers, the National Union of Railwaymen, the Electrical Trades Union, and the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers.

    比万当选英工党司库
    据新华社布莱克浦3日电　英国工党左翼领袖比万10月2日在工党年会上午会议上在热烈欢呼声中当选为工党司库——党内第二位重要职务。比万得到了三百零二万九千票；而同他竞争的前任大臣、受到工党右翼人士支持的乔治·布朗得到了二百七十五万五千票。
    比万的胜利结束了他三年来竞选司库职务的运动。许多人认为，这不仅是他个人的胜利，而且是下层工党党员越来越多地要求工党采取较为开明的政策的结果。
    比万过去曾经同得到右翼工会领袖支持的现任英国工党领袖盖次克尔竞争过工党司库职位，但是没有成功。这一次，比万不仅得到工党地方组织的支持，而且还得到如全国矿工联盟、全国铁路工人工会、电气工会、店员与送货工人联合会等一些工会的支持。
