Xinhua News Agency, Harbin – The jointly owned public-private Songhua River Furniture Factory and the locally state-owned Harbin Furniture Factory in Harbin are manufacturing 1,227 mobile field houses for workers building the Qaidam Basin. More than 200 of these houses have already been completed and will be transported to the basin soon.

    Some of these prefabricated houses have an area of ​​11 square meters per unit, and some have an area of ​​34 square meters per unit; some can be used as offices, and some can be used as collective dormitories or for two to three families to live in. This kind of house is easy to move and simple to assemble. A 34-square-meter house weighs only 1,800 kilograms and can be transported by just one truck. This is very beneficial for places like the Qaidam Basin where transportation is inconvenient and materials for building houses are scarce. This type of house is inexpensive and can insulate and keep warm.

    These prefabricated houses manufactured by the two factories will be completed in mid-November.

    为柴达木盆地职工赶制活动房屋
    新华社哈尔滨讯　哈尔滨市公私合营松花江家具厂和地方国营哈尔滨家具厂共同为建设柴达木盆地的职工制造的一千二百二十七幢野外活动房屋，现在已经做好了两百多幢。这些做好的房屋，最近就要运往盆地。
    这批活动房屋的面积，有的每幢为十一平方公尺，有的每幢为三十四平方公尺；有的可作办公室用，有的可作集体宿舍或供两户到三户家属居住。这种房屋移动方便，装配简单。三十四平方公尺的房屋只有一千八百公斤重，只要一辆载重汽车就可以运走。这对像柴达木盆地这类交通不便、缺少做房屋材料的地方，有很大好处。这种房屋价格不高，并且能够保温隔热。
    这两个工厂制造的这批活动房屋，将在11月中旬完成。
