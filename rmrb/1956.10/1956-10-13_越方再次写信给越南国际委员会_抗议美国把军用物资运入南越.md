The letter stated that hundreds of tons of military supplies were transported into South Vietnam in July alone, which seriously violated the Geneva Accords. The Vietnam People's Army requested the International Commission to take effective measures to stop such illegal actions.

    越方再次写信给越南国际委员会
    抗议美国把军用物资运入南越
    新华社河内12日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团10月9日再次写信给越南国际委员会，抗议美国不断将大量军用物资运进越南南方的非法行动。
    信上说，光是在7月份就有几百吨军用物资运入越南南方，这严重地违犯了日内瓦协定。越南人民军要求国际委员会采取有效措施制止这种非法行动。
    越南人民军联络代表团已经把近几个月美国非法把军用物资运入越南南方的详细情况陆续写信告诉国际委员会。在9月5日的一封信上指出，8月15日有一艘美国船把近一千箱弹药和一百多吨机枪和轻机枪的配件在西贡运交南越军队。8月31日，又有一艘美国船在同一地点运入一千多吨步枪、机枪的配件和其他军用物资。
