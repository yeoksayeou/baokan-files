From Design and Process Reform to Save Steel
The First Ministry of Machine Building Saves a Lot of Material Costs at Shenyang Factories This Year

(Our Newspaper) The factories in Shenyang, which are subordinate to the First Ministry of Machine Building, have generally paid attention to saving steel materials. According to preliminary statistics from eighteen workshops, by the end of this year, a total of more than 230,000 yuan worth of metal materials and various consumables will be saved, and the problem of insufficient supply of raw materials will be partially solved.

Since the second half of this year, the supply departments of various factories have checked the implementation of the supply plan, checked inventory and ordering contracts, and widely carried out mutual exchange and mutual adjustment of different steel materials between factories. At the same time, unreasonable material consumption quotas have been revised, and workers have been organized to recover and utilize waste materials.

Engineering and technical personnel have carefully calculated and reformed designs and processes on the premise of ensuring product quality and continuously improving product performance. The designers of the Shenyang Water Pump Factory improved the design of more than 20 specifications of water pump seat bodies, saving an average of 30 kilograms of cast iron per unit. The designers of the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory improved the relay design of the dual-speed switch, and it is estimated that by the end of the year, more than 7,000 yuan of wealth can be saved. The steel materials saved this year are expected to make 400 rock drills.

    从设计和工艺改革上节约钢铁
    第一机械工业部在沈阳工厂今年节约大量材料费
    本报讯　第一机械工业部所属在沈阳的工厂，普遍注意节约钢铁材料，据十八个车间的初步统计，到今年年底，共可节约价值二十三万余元的金属材料和各种消耗品，原材料供应不足的问题将部分得到解决。
    今年下半年以来，各工厂的供应部门都检查了供应计划执行情况，并检查库存和订货合同，厂与厂之间对不同的钢铁材料也广泛进行了互通有无和互相调剂的工作；同时，还修订了不合理的材料消耗定额，组织工人回收和利用废料。
    工程技术人员在保证产品质量和不断提高产品性能的前提下，从设计和工艺上精打细算进行改革。沈阳水泵厂设计人员改进了二十多种规格水泵座体的设计，平均每台可节约三十公斤铸铁。沈阳低压开关厂的设计人员，改进双速开关的继电器设计，预计到年末可节约七千多元的财富。今年节约的钢铁材料，预计可做成四百台凿岩机。
