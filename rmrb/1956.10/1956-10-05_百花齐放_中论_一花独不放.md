On "One Flower Not Blooming" in "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom"
    柴德赓

    Since the Central Committee put forward the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, an unprecedentedly lively atmosphere has emerged in the cultural and scientific circles, which is something to be happy about. Minister Lu Dingyi put it well: "If only 'one flower blooms' in literary and artistic work, no matter how good that flower is, it will not prosper." Originally, if all the flowers are dormant and only one flower blooms, it is inevitably a bit monotonous. However, in the midst of all the colors, if there is "one flower that does not bloom" and gradually withers, it would also spoil the scenery.

    In fact, in our splendid flower garden, there is a kind of flower. It has a glorious history of thousands of years. It has a close connection with our national culture. It has always been liked by our vast people, but now it is "alone in a corner" and very lonely, unable to bloom. That is "calligraphy," which has a long tradition in our national culture.

    How lonely is it? First of all, this flower seems to have been forgotten by the leading departments of our cultural work. It has not been mentioned since liberation. In the past, places like the Palace Museum attached importance to both calligraphy and painting. The Palace Museum Weekly printed both calligraphy and painting, and also printed many authentic works by famous calligraphers since the Tang and Song dynasties. These authentic works are indeed much better than the printed editions seen by people in the Qing Dynasty, and are highly valued by those who love calligraphy. After liberation, these famous calligraphic works that had been plate-made were no longer printed, and new ones were not even mentioned. In the past, there were often calligraphy and painting exhibitions in Beijing or other places. Now, there are still painting exhibitions, but calligraphy has disappeared from exhibitions. I don't know where this influence comes from, but especially in small and medium-sized cities, many people think that writing with a brush is a backward form, representing backward thinking. Whether it is Beijing, Shanghai, or other cities, it is not easy to buy better stationery such as letter paper and envelopes suitable for writing with a brush in stationery stores. In addition, there are.... Ah! Loneliness, loneliness!

    Let us not talk about it from any artistic theory, but just look at the fact that for thousands of years, since the oracle bone inscriptions and bronze inscriptions, writing has not only played the role of recording symbols, but also played the role of inspiring aesthetic feeling anytime and anywhere. At least, upright and beautiful fonts are loved, let alone more excellent works? Therefore, from a small bookmark to large plaques, couplets, and inscriptions, they are all written with a brush. Only if they are written well can they meet people's visual needs. In recent years, when reprinting books such as Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Water Margin, and Dream of the Red Chamber, Mr. Shen Yinmo is always invited to write a bookplate. Why? For beauty, to meet the preferences of readers. Not long ago, someone reflected in the newspaper that some books specially for children to read had a child's font as the title, thinking that children would definitely like it, but unexpectedly, children did not like this kind of "naive" writing. What children like are upright and beautiful characters. Don't we often hear people say that the characters written by today's primary school students, middle school students, and even college students and government cadres are really not good-looking without any basic training? This reason is very obvious.

    Of course, in terms of writing speed and convenience of carrying and using, brush writing is not without its shortcomings. But as an artistic variety that can enrich the national culture, from the perspective of enhancing the aesthetic form of national characters, especially from the perspective of the vast people's love for calligraphy, there is no reason to "put calligraphy into the cold palace" or put it in a place of "self-reliance." As for the reform of writing, that is another matter.

    I once met some comrades who are engaged in cultural work in local areas and asked them why they did not promote calligraphy? Their answer is often "The superiors do not advocate it, how can we advocate it?" Of course, a job that should be done cannot wait for the superiors to advocate it. At the same time, the superiors have not issued any explicit documents indicating that they do not advocate or oppose it. However, the matter is in front of us, and under the "understanding of the intentions of the leading comrades," it is undeniable that calligraphy is despised. Some cultural institutions occasionally spend thousands or tens of thousands of yuan to buy ancient paintings (it is of course right to buy famous paintings), but they do not pay attention to the acquisition of famous calligraphy works. In some places, famous steles and rubbings from past dynasties have been used as "firecrackers." The art of calligraphy has sunk down in such an unheeded or indifferent encounter. I think its encounter is more sad than being clearly opposed. Because if someone expresses clear opposition in theory, at this time of a hundred schools of thought contending, there may still be a chance for debate; but being buried like this is even more dark and terrible. It must also be stated here: the reason why calligraphy still exists in society today, almost negligibly, is entirely due to the love of the people, which is enough to prove that this art has its independent existence value.

    I am not trying to win any fame for calligraphy. I always feel that traditional art should be continued, and flowers should always be allowed to bloom. I hope that the central cultural departments will consider this issue. If there are different opinions, they can be openly discussed. Flowers always have to bloom, and if you grasp them too tightly, they will naturally not bloom. As long as you are not prejudiced, it is good to let the flowers bloom freely; it would be even better if you could spend some time cultivating and caring for them. I feel that improving cultural level and enriching artistic life are the common requirements of the people of the whole country. Then, what is wrong with opening up another kind of flower and letting everyone satisfy their requirements?

### “百花齐放”中论“一花独不放”

    “百花齐放”中论“一花独不放”
    柴德赓
    自从中央提出百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针以来，文化界、科学界出现了前所未有的活泼气象，这是应该高兴的事情。陆定一部长说得好：“文艺工作，如果‘一花独放’，无论那朵花怎么好，也是不会繁荣的。”本来，群芳皆歇，一花独放，未免有些单调。可是，在万紫千红之中，如果有“一花独不放”，并且逐渐枯萎下去，那也未免煞风景。
    事实上在我们这灿烂的花丛中，却有一种花，它有过几千年的光辉历史，它和我们民族文化有着血肉的关联，它一直被我们广大人民所喜好，而现在正“一人向隅”地在那里十分寂寞，不得一放。那就是我们民族文化中具有悠久传统的“书法”。
    寂寞到什么程度呢？首先是这朵花好像被我们文化工作的领导部门忘怀了，解放以来一直不提它。从前像故宫博物院还是书画一样重视，故宫周刊上所印的有书有画，另外还印了许多唐宋以来有名书家的真迹。这些真迹，确比清朝人所能见到的印本强得多，极为爱好书法者所珍视。解放后，这些原来制了版的名家法书一概不印，新的更不要提了。从前在北京或外地经常有书画展览会，现在，画展还有，书法就绝迹于展览会了。也不知是哪里来的一种影响，特别是中小城市，很多人认为写毛笔字是落后形式，表现思想落后。不管是北京、上海，或其他城市，我们想在文具店买点比较好的适合于写毛笔字的信纸信封等，也不容易得到。此外，还有……。啊！寂寞呀，寂寞！
    我们姑且不从什么艺术理论上谈，只看看几千年来自甲骨金文以后，文字不但担负着记事符号的作用，还更随时随地起着发人美感的作用，起码端正美观的字体是受人喜爱的，何况更高到特别优秀的作品呢？因此，小到一个书签，大而至于匾额、对联、碑文，都以毛笔书写，写得又好，才能满足人们视感上的需要。这几年重印的三国演义、水浒、红楼梦等书籍，总是请沈尹默先生写个书签。为什么？为了美观，为了符合读者的喜好。不久以前，有人曾在报上反映某些专为小朋友阅读的书本，弄个小孩字体作题签，以为小朋友一定会喜欢，却想不到小朋友偏偏不喜欢这种“天真”的写法，小朋友所喜欢的却是端正美丽的字。我们不是常常听人说今天的小学生、中学生、甚至大学生、机关干部写的毫无基本训练的字样实在不好看吗？这个道理是很明显的。
    当然，在书写的速度上，在携带和使用的方便上，毛笔字不是没有缺点的。但作为一种能够丰富民族文化的艺术品种来看，从更能增强民族文字的造型美来看，尤其从广大人民对书法的喜好来看，没有理由可以把书法“打入冷宫”或置之“自生自灭”之地。至于文字改革，那是另外一回事。
    我曾经遇到部分在地方搞文化工作的同志，问他们为什么不提倡书法？他们的回答常常是“上级不提倡，我们怎么提倡？”当然一种应该做的工作不能等上级的提倡，同时，上级也并没有发布过什么明文，表示不提倡或反对。但是，事情摆在面前，在“体会领导同志的意图”之下，轻视书法是不必讳言的。某些文化机构花几千几万元买古画的事儿间或有之（收购名画，当然是应该的），对收购名人法书则不重视。有些地方，曾经拿历代有名的碑帖去做“爆竹”了。书法这一门艺术，就在这样不理或冷淡的遭遇中沉埋下来。我觉得它的遭遇比起被明白反对的还可悲哀。因为如果有人从理论上表示明白反对，当此百家争鸣之际，还可以有争论的机会；沉埋至此，却是更阴暗可怕。这里还得说明：今天书法一道所以若有若无地还存留于社会上，完全是由于人民群众的喜好，更足以证明这种艺术有它独立存在的价值。
    我不是要替书法争出个什么名堂来，我总觉得传统的艺术应该延续下去，有花总应该放。我希望中央文化部门考虑这一问题。如果有不同意见，可以公开讨论。花总是要放的，抓得紧了自然就放不成了。只要不是抱着偏见，让花自由自在地开放，也是好的；能加点工夫培养、爱护，那就更好。我觉得提高文化水平，丰富艺术生活，既是全国人民的共同要求，那末，多开一种花，让大家满足要求，又有什么不好呢？
