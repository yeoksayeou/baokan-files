    "Three No's" Highway
    The nation's highways are managed by the Highway General Bureau, each province's highways are managed by the provincial highway bureaus, and each county and district also has highway management agencies. It stands to reason that all highways should be managed and maintained. However, in reality, there are many "three no's" highways. Although each section is only about two kilometers long, and the longest is no more than ten kilometers, each section has a bumpy and uneven road surface with countless ditches and pits. When cars drive on these highways, they must reduce speed, which consumes more fuel and easily damages parts.
    These highways are mostly located where provinces meet or where rural areas are about to enter cities (generally small and medium-sized cities). For example, at the junction of Shandong Province and Hebei Province, there is a section of the highway from Dezhou to Leling that is rarely maintained. Drivers call it "the road to hell." Shandong Province believes that it should be maintained by Hebei Province, and they don't care. Hebei Province, in turn, believes that it is your Shandong's cars that are using it and that it has nothing to do with them. Another example is the section of road about one kilometer long before entering Yanzhou. The highway section believes that it is a local road and should not be their responsibility; while Ziyang County believes that this section is not a key construction area for them, so they ignore it. Examples like this are too numerous to mention, and similar situations may exist in other provinces. But it is the automobile transportation companies that suffer. Road maintenance fees must be paid as required, but the roads are not maintained, resulting in more fuel consumption and damaged parts, as if they deserve it.
    These roads must be managed and maintained so that cars can drive smoothly. It is hoped that the Highway General Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the highway bureaus of each province will divide the current "three no's" areas, and whoever is assigned to manage them should no longer refuse.

### “三不管”的公路

    “三不管”的公路
    全国的公路有公路总局管，各省的公路有省的公路局管，各县、区也设有公路管理机构。按说所有的公路都应该有人管理和养护的了。然而事实上却存在着许多“三不管”的公路。这些公路虽然每一段只不过二公里左右，最长的也不过十多公里，但每一段都是路面坎坷不平，沟坑无数。汽车行驶到这些公路上，必须降低速度，既多消耗燃料，又容易损坏机件。
    这样的公路大都在省与省接界的地方或者在农村将要进入城市（一般为中小城市）的地方。例如山东省与河北省接界的地方，由德州至乐陵的公路，就有一段很少有人养护。驾驶员都称它是“阎王鼻子路”。山东省认为那是该河北省养护的，我们不管。河北省又认为那是你们山东跑车的，与我们无关。又如快要进入兖州时，就有一公里多这样的路，公路段认为那是地方上的路，不该我们管；而滋阳县又认为那一段不是我们建设的重点区，也就置之不理。像这样的例子，真是不胜枚举，在别的省份可能也有类似情况。但倒霉的却是汽车运输公司，养路费必需照章缴纳，路却无人养护，而多耗燃料，损坏机件，好像是活该似的。
    对于这样的路，必须要有人管，有人养护，让汽车能平稳地行驶，希望交通部公路总局和各省公路局把现在“三不管”地带划分一下，划归谁管的，谁就不要再推。
