A new stage in the development of Danube hydro resources
    With the economic development of the People's Democracies of Eastern Europe and the increasing need for electricity, the joint development of the Danube River has been put on the agenda, becoming an important issue for mutual coordination among Eastern European countries in the long-term development of their national economies.

    The meeting of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) composed of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies of Europe, held in Berlin in May this year, adopted a work plan for formulating a comprehensive development of the Danube's hydropower resources. In June, Romania and Yugoslavia also concluded an agreement to establish a joint Romanian-Yugoslavian commission to study the possibility of jointly building a hydroelectric power station in the Iron Gate area of the Danube River.

    The Danube is the most important river in Europe in terms of its economic significance. It is an international navigation artery with extremely rich hydropower resources. In addition, the Danube's potential for irrigation and fisheries development is also enormous. The Danube River, which is 2,900 kilometers long, flows through eight countries from its source to the Black Sea. It is navigable from Ulm in Germany downstream. Thirty-four of the Danube's 120 major tributaries are navigable. The largest of these are the Tisza, Seret, Prut, Drava, Sava, and Morava rivers.

    The Danube's annual flow is 200 billion cubic meters, which is an average of 6,300 tons per second. According to incomplete statistics, the total hydropower resources of the Danube and its tributaries amount to more than 35 million kilowatts, accounting for more than three-fifths of Europe's total hydropower resources.

    Although the Danube has such abundant hydropower resources, in the past, the rule of the European powers and the landlords and bourgeoisie of various countries in the Danube region not only hindered the development of the Danube riparian states, but also hindered the full utilization of the river's hydropower resources. In the past, Danube shipping was often in a state of crisis. There were sixteen different customs and police regulations on the Danube River, and each country had checkpoints for inspections, with as many as eight kinds of currencies being levied.

    After the Second World War, many countries along the Danube were liberated one after another. The people of the riparian countries built many hydropower stations, dams, and reservoirs on the Danube and its tributaries, and dug canals and channels. Vast industrial areas have obtained electricity from the Danube River, and millions of hectares of land have been irrigated. However, the utilization of the Danube's hydropower is still in a state of individual countries acting alone, which also limits the utilization of the Danube's abundant hydropower resources. With the vigorous economic development of the People's Democracies of Eastern Europe and the increasing cooperation between countries, the issue of jointly developing the Danube in a comprehensive way is not only necessary but also possible. In this way, the utilization of the Danube's rich resources has entered a new stage.

    Czechoslovakia and Poland are studying the possibility of connecting Danube navigation with the navigation of the Oder and Vistula rivers. In addition to building a dam and hydroelectric power station in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia will jointly build a hydroelectric power station with Hungary in Visegrad, which is located on the border between the two countries. Romania and Bulgaria are also drafting a Romanian-Bulgarian cooperation plan to build dams and hydroelectric power stations on the Danube. However, the most daring and important plan is the plan to build a huge hydroelectric power station in the Iron Gate area between Romania and Yugoslavia.

    The Iron Gate is one of the most beautiful places on the Danube River. The Danube, which flows smoothly through the Hungarian Plain, turns into a turbulent rapid between Brazil Ash and Tnu-Severin. In this section of less than 140 kilometers, the water level drops by 30 meters, and the river water in this area flows in the middle of rocky slopes of different heights from 200 meters to 2,000 meters. The hydroelectric power station to be built in the Iron Gate area can be compared with some of the world's largest hydroelectric power stations - the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station and the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station on the Volga River, and the Grand Coulee Hydroelectric Power Station in the United States.

    In addition, the navigation of the Danube can be further developed. After the channel in the Tnu-Severin to Breila section is deepened, large ships weighing 4,000 tons will be able to pass smoothly, and ocean-going vessels will be able to travel directly along the Danube to Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia.

    In agriculture, after the completion of the hydroelectric power station, the river water can also be used to irrigate more than one million hectares of land. The lake water used for power generation and irrigation in the artificial lake formed by the dam of the hydroelectric power station can also be widely used for fish farming.

    Equal and mutually beneficial economic cooperation between the People's Democracies of Eastern Europe will help them tame this majestic river. The Danube will become a river that serves socialist construction and brings happiness and prosperity to the people of Eastern European countries.

    开发多瑙河水力资源的新阶段
    随着东欧各人民民主国家的经济发展和对电力需要的日益增长，共同开发多瑙河的问题已提上了日程，成为东欧各国在国民经济远景发展上相互配合的重要问题之一了。
    今年5月在柏林举行的由苏联、欧洲各人民民主国家组成的八国经济互助委员会会议曾通过了关于制定通盘开发多瑙河水力发电资源的工作计划。6月，罗马尼亚和南斯拉夫两国也缔结了一项协定，决定成立一个罗南联合委员会，以便研究在多瑙河的铁门地方共同建立一座水电站的可能性问题。
    多瑙河按其经济重要性来说，是欧洲第一条大河。它是一条国际通航干线，有极其丰富的水力资源。此外，在灌溉和发展养鱼业方面，多瑙河的潜力也是巨大的。全长二千九百公里的多瑙河从发源地到黑海共经流八个国家。从德国的乌尔姆以下，都可以通航。多瑙河的一百二十条主要支流中有三十四条可以通航。其中最大的有蒂萨河、塞列特河、普鲁特河、德拉瓦河、萨瓦河、摩拉瓦河等。
    多瑙河每年的流量为二千亿立方公尺，也就是说平均每秒六千三百吨。据不完全统计，多瑙河及其支流的水力资源总共为三千五百多万瓩，占欧洲整个水力资源的五分之三以上。
    多瑙河虽然拥有这样丰富的水力资源，但是，在过去，欧洲列强和各国地主资产阶级对多瑙河地区的统治，不但阻碍了多瑙河沿岸国家的发展，而且也阻碍了对河流水力资源的充分利用。过去多瑙河的航运就经常处在危机状态。多瑙河上曾有过十六种不同的关税和警察规章，每一个国家都有关卡进行检查，征用的货币竟达到八种之多。
    第二次世界大战以后，多瑙河沿岸的许多国家相继获得了解放。沿岸国家的人民在多瑙河和它的支流上建造了许多水电站、水坝、贮水池，开凿了运河和渠道。广大的工业区从多瑙河获得了电力，千百万公顷的土地获得了水的灌溉。但是，对多瑙河的水力的利用仍然处于个别国家单独进行的状态，因而对多瑙河丰富的水力资源的利用也有着局限性。随着东欧各人民民主国家经济的蓬勃发展和各国之间的合作的日益加强，共同合力全盘开发多瑙河的问题，不仅是必要的而且也是可能的了。这样，对多瑙河的丰富资源的利用，就步入了一个新的阶段。
    捷克斯洛伐克和波兰正在研究把多瑙河的航运同奥得河和维斯杜拉河的航运连接起来的可能性。捷克斯洛伐克除去在布拉迪斯拉发正在建立水坝和水电站以外，将和匈牙利在位于两国交界的维希格拉德地方共同建造一座水电站。罗马尼亚和保加利亚也在拟订在多瑙河上建造水坝和水电站的罗保合作的计划。但是，最大胆的和最重要的一项计划，就是在罗马尼亚和南斯拉城之间的铁门地方建立巨大水电站的计划。
    铁门是多瑙河上最美的一个地方。平稳地流过匈牙利平原的多瑙河到了巴西阿什和特努—塞维林两城之间，就变成了波涛汹涌的急流。在这段不到一百四十公里的距离内，水位落差达到三十公尺，并且这个地区的河水是流在从二百公尺到两千公尺不同高度的岩石斜坡中间的。将在铁门地方建成的这座水电站，可以同世界最大的几个水电站——伏尔加河上的斯大林格勒水电站和古比雪夫水电站，以及美国的大古里水电站相媲美。
    此外，还可以进一步发展多瑙河的航运。在特努—塞维林到布瑞拉地段的河道加深以后，重达四千吨的大船将能顺利通行，海轮也就可以沿着多瑙河直接行驶到南斯拉夫的首都贝尔格莱德了。
    在农业方面，这座水电站建成以后，还可以利用河水来灌溉一百多万公顷的田地。水电站拦河坝形成的人工湖中供发电和灌溉用的湖水还可以广泛地利用来养鱼。
    东欧各人民民主国家之间的平等互利的经济合作将有助于它们来驯服这条雄伟的大河。多瑙河将成为一条为社会主义建设服务、为东欧各国人民带来幸福和繁荣的河流。
