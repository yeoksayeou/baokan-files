    Towards the Shores of the East Sea
    ——Introducing the Soon-to-be-Completed Yingxia Railway
  　Zhou Minshan
    In the southeast of the motherland, the Ying (tan) Xia (men) Railway, which leads to the Taiwan Strait, will soon be completed.
    When it comes to building railways, the people of Fujian Province cannot help but recall a heartbreaking event: as early as 1906, overseas Chinese and capitalists within the province invested in the construction of the Zhang (zhou) Xia (men) Railway. However, under the rule of the reactionary government at the time, it took seven years, squandered 2.22 million yuan, and only completed a section of less than 28 kilometers from Songyu to Jiangdong. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang government, under the pretext of "dispersing materials," stole and sold all the rails and sleepers of this railway. At this point, the hope of the people of Fujian to build a railway was completely dashed.
    In October 1954, the Yingxia Railway broke ground. This railway starts from the Yingtan Station on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway in Jiangxi, crosses the winding Luxi River, traverses the fields of southeastern Jiangxi, and passes through the towering Wuyi Mountains, entering Fujian Province. From here, it crosses the swift Futun River and the Shaxi River, a tributary of the Min River, crosses the undulating mountains and ridges of northern Fujian, and passes through the abundant towns of Guangze, Shaowu, Shunchang, Sha County, Sanyuan, and Yong'an. Leaving Yong'an, the railway crosses the seven peaks of the watershed between northern and southern Fujian, and enters the ever-spring Minnan region. Continuing southeast, the railway crosses the Xinqiao River three times and the Jiulong River twice, passing through Zhangping and Hua'an, known for their fruits, and then crosses the strait directly towards Xiamen Port. The entire line is 697.7 kilometers long.
    Fujian is a place of mountains upon mountains and rivers upon rivers. The Yingxia Railway almost entirely winds through towering mountains, ridges, river valleys, and canyons. The entire line has 46 tunnels, the longest of which is the Daheshan Tunnel in the Wuyi Mountains, which is nearly 3 Chinese miles long. Currently, it is the largest tunnel in the Jiangnan region. There are 1,973 bridges and culverts, with a total length of nearly 40 kilometers. The longest one is one Chinese mile long. Due to the undulating mountains along the line, the total length of earthwork with high filling and deep excavation is 178 kilometers. Gongziwan is the most concentrated area for earthwork, where more than 600,000 cubic meters need to be filled and excavated within a range of over 600 meters. Another characteristic of the Yingxia Railway is the construction of two 5-kilometer-long sea dykes, Jimei and Xinglin, between the mainland and Xiamen Island, turning Xiamen Island into a peninsula and permanently connecting Xiamen Island, which has been isolated by the sea since ancient times, to the mainland. This is something that our predecessors dared not imagine. In the future, trains will be able to slowly drive across the tall and majestic sea dykes, fully loaded with various materials, and directly into Xiamen Port. Such a difficult land reclamation project is rare in the history of railway construction in the country.
    The builders of the Yingxia Railway were the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and hundreds of thousands of laborers from Jiangxi and Fujian provinces. They braved the summer heat and winter frost of the south, working day and night with an overwhelming momentum, constantly extending the railway forward.
    This spring, the vast numbers of soldiers, workers, and staff on the entire line launched a socialist competition upsurge. Along the line, the mechanical operations and mountain-opening roars of key projects shook the valleys. The Daheshan Tunnel was a key project of the entire line. The soldiers and workers participating in the construction bravely dug into the mountain day and night. Yin Shanglong, the company commander of a certain unit responsible for the excavation at the southern entrance, led more than half of the new recruits, relying on the masses to continuously improve construction methods, creating nine new records in a row, and using the "wet drilling method" to increase work efficiency by fourteen times. Many such outstanding labors enabled the Daheshan Tunnel to be opened nearly five months ahead of schedule. In order to accelerate the progress of the project, the Railway Corps adopted the Soviet Union's advanced "large blasting" construction method extensively based on the terrain along the line. From the end of last year to now, 75 large and medium blasts have been carried out on the entire line. The watershed between northern and southern Fujian was almost entirely blasted out with a flat roadbed using large and medium blasting methods. In the entire blasting process, more than half of the earth and stone were automatically discarded or flew to nearby filling areas in the specified direction.
    The people responsible for building the sea dyke project fought against the wind, waves, and tides day and night. The tide rises and falls four times a day, and the heroic laborers took advantage of the tens of minutes of space when the tide receded to make a full assault, throwing stones into the sea, which was several meters deep. Millions of cubic meters of stone materials were filled in to build a long sea dyke. When the two ends of the dyke body were joined together, a breach of more than 100 meters long was suddenly impacted by the gale-force winds and torrential rains of May and the surging tides. The bottom of the dyke was also hollowed out into a deep trench four meters wide, and hundreds of kilograms of stones were swept away by the huge waves, and the seawater often flooded over the dyke body. In this extremely urgent situation, the laborers braved the gale-force winds and huge waves to rush to plug the breach day and night. Hundreds of sailboats shuttled back and forth on the sea to transport stone materials. In the rush to plug the breach, dispatcher Lin Yuqin studied the bamboo cage rapid stone throwing method based on the inclined plane rapid stone throwing method, which increased the speed from three people throwing fifteen cubic meters of stone materials in thirty minutes to three people throwing twenty cubic meters of stone materials in two seconds, greatly accelerating the rush to plug the breach. After the intense labor of the laborers, the breach in the Xinglin Sea Dyke finally reappeared on the sea surface, connecting the two ends of the dyke again.
    In order to make the construction of the Yingxia Railway more reasonable, the people who built the Yingxia Railway put forward many rationalization proposals, reduced a large amount of engineering work, and saved more than 100 million yuan and more than 16 million workdays of labor due to improved design and reduced indirect costs. Wang Zhisui, a bridge engineer of the Railway Corps, traveled between mountains and valleys all day long. He was meticulous about the inappropriate parts of the original design. In just a few months, he found 218 bridges and culverts that needed to be modified in two engineering management districts alone, saving the country an investment of 1.49 million yuan. Wang Chuanjue, a 53-year-old senior engineer, put forward more than a dozen rationalization proposals in terms of line changes. Due to his proposal, the Dayuancun Tunnel project was cancelled. This tunnel was the fourth largest tunnel on the entire line, with a length of 608 meters, reducing 543,000 cubic meters of earth and stone, shortening the line by 306 meters, and saving more than 1.98 million yuan in construction costs.
    Fujian is extremely rich in products. Taking timber as an example, it is one of the four major forest areas in my country, with a forest area of more than 2.3 million hectares and a total timber storage of 120 million cubic meters. The fir, which is most suitable for construction, can be harvested here in 20 years. After the Yingxia Railway is opened to traffic, not only can Fujian's timber greatly support industrial construction throughout the country, but also various mineral deposits can be vigorously mined and transported out in a steady stream. The rich local and special products and subtropical fruits and fish products in the mountainous areas, which have historically been unable to be transported out due to traffic congestion, can also expand sales.
    In my country's first five-year plan, it was stipulated that the Yingxia Railway would be built to the vicinity of Yong'an, Fujian Province, in 1957, a total of 443 kilometers. Now, after one year and ten months, the Yingxia Railway has advanced the track laying to Yong'an Station on the "August 1st" Army Day this year. At present, the track-laying train is advancing towards Xiamen along the newly built roadbed! It is expected that the track-laying task can be completed on the main line by the end of this year.
    As the project advances southward section by section, the Yingxia Railway is gradually opening temporary operations. At present, between Yingtan and Nanping, in addition to busy engineering trains transporting rails, sleepers, machinery and other engineering materials, there are also trains loaded with freight bustling day and night. Shaowu is the first central station for the Yingxia Railway to enter Fujian, and it is also a material distribution center for nine counties in northern Fujian. Here, local and special products such as timber, rice, bamboo, shiitake mushrooms, dried bamboo shoots, paper, live pigs, tea, lotus seeds, and medicinal materials from the Futun River and Jianxi River basins and mountainous areas in the upper reaches of the Min River are loaded and transported out every day. A large number of materials such as fertilizer and construction equipment from Shanghai and other places are also transferred from Yingtan to Zixi, Guangze, Shaowu and other counties along the railway to support the production and construction in the mountainous areas and supply the living needs of the people in the mountainous areas.
    The construction of the Yingxia Railway has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the people along the line. The people along the line in Guangze and Shaowu counties have recently built more than 400 kilometers of highways and mountain trails to connect many villages with railway stations. Agricultural cooperatives along the line have actively developed agriculture and diversified economic crops based on the new situation of convenient transportation. More than 200 agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperatives in Guangze County have revised their original production plans and increased production targets. Eighteen townships and towns in the railway area within Shaowu County, in addition to ensuring the completion of this year's production increase task, also developed sideline production such as fish farming, melon and fruit planting, and potato cultivation, to supply food for passengers. The counties along the line in northern Fujian actively reclaimed wasteland and afforested, with an area of more than 58,000 mu. (Attached picture)

    通向东海之滨
    ——介绍即将完工的鹰厦铁路
  　周岷山
    在祖国的东南，通向台湾海峡的鹰（潭）厦（门）铁路，不久就要完工了。
    提起修筑铁路来，福建省的人民不能不想起这样一件伤心的事情：远在1906年起，海外华侨和省内的资本家就投资修建漳（州）厦（门）铁路。但是，在当时反动政府的统治下，化了七年的时间，虚耗了二百二十二万元，只修成了从嵩屿到江东不足二十八公里的一段。抗日战争时期，国民党政府借口“疏散物资”，把这条铁路的钢轨、枕木盗卖一空。至此，福建人民修筑铁路的希望全部落空了。
    1954年10月，鹰厦铁路破土开工了。这条铁路由浙赣路的江西鹰潭车站起，跨过蜿蜒的泸溪河，越过赣东南的原野，穿过高大巍峨的武夷山，就进入福建境内。从这里跨过水流急湍的富屯溪和闽江的支流沙溪，越过闽北起伏的崇山峻岭，经过丰饶的光泽、邵武、顺昌、沙县、三元和永安山城。出永安，铁路翻越闽北、闽南分水岭的七座山峰，便进入四季皆春的闽南地区。再向东南行，铁路连续三渡新桥河，两跨九龙江，经水果之乡漳平、华安而下，就跨过海峡直趋厦门港。全线共长六百九十七点七公里。
    福建是山连山，河交河的地方。鹰厦铁路就几乎全部在崇山峻岭、河川峡谷中蜿蜒伸展。全线有隧道四十六座，其中最长是武夷山上将近三华里的大禾山隧道，在目前来说，它是江南第一座大隧道。桥涵有一千九百七十三座，总延长将近有四十公里。其中最长的有一华里长。由于沿线山峦起伏，全线高填深挖的土方工程总延长有一百七十八公里，宫子湾是土石方工程最集中地方，在六百多公尺的范围内，要填挖六十多万立方。鹰厦铁路另一个特点是，在陆地和厦门岛之间，要修筑集美、杏林两条五公里长的跨海长堤，变厦门岛为半岛，使自古以来被大海隔离的厦门岛同陆地永远连结起来。这是我们前人所不敢想的事情。将来，火车便可以满载着各种物资缓缓地驶过高大雄伟的海堤，一直开进厦门港。像这样艰巨的填海工程，在全国铁路建设史上还是少有的。
    修筑鹰厦铁路的，是中国人民解放军铁道兵部队，和江西、福建两省的十几万民工。他们冒着南方夏季的炎热和冬季的风霜，以排山倒海之势日夜施工，使铁路不断向前伸展。
    今年春季，全线广大军工、民工和职工，掀起了社会主义竞赛高潮。沿线各个重点工程，机械的作业声和开山的轰鸣声震撼山谷。大禾山隧道是全线的关键工程。参加施工的军工和民工，日夜英勇地向山心掘挖。负责南口开挖的某部一连连长尹尚龙，率领一半以上的新兵，依靠群众不断地改进施工方法，连续创造了九次新纪录，并且运用“湿式凿岩法”，提高工效十四倍。许多像这样杰出的劳动，使大禾山隧道提前近五个月打通。为加速工程进展，铁道兵根据沿线地形情况，大量采用苏联“大爆破”的先进施工方法。从去年年底到现在，全线有七十五处进行过大、中爆破。闽南闽北分水岭，几乎全是用大、中爆破的方法，炸出一条平坦的路基。在整个爆破中，有一半以上的土石方自动扬弃或按指定方向飞到附近的填方内。
    负责修筑海堤工程的人们，日夜同风浪海潮搏斗。海潮每天涨落四次，英勇的民工们乘着潮退的几十分钟空间，全力突击，向深及数公尺以上的海里抛填石头。整个填了几百万立方的石料，才砌成一条长长的海堤。当堤身两头接合起来的时候，突然被5月里的狂风暴雨和汹涌的潮浪冲击出一百多公尺长的决口，堤底也被掏成一道四公尺宽的深沟，数百斤重的石块被巨浪卷走，海水时时漫过堤身。在这万分紧急的情况下，民工们冒着狂风巨浪，夜以继日地抢堵决口。上百只帆船川流不息地在海上运送石料。在抢堵中，调度员林玉钦根据斜面快速抛石法研究出竹笼快速抛石法，由原来三个人在三十分钟内抛十五立方石料，提高到三个人在两秒钟内抛二十立方石料。大大地加速抢堵速度。经过民工们紧张的劳动，杏林海堤决口终于重新露出海面，把堤的两端又连接起来。
    为了使鹰厦铁路的建设更加合理，修建鹰厦铁路的人们提了许多合理化建议，削减了大量工程量，由于改进设计，节省间接费等因素，全线节省费用一亿多元，节省劳动力一千六百余万工天。铁道兵桥梁工程师王志遂，成天奔波在山川深谷之间。对原设计不妥当的地方一丝不苟，几个月内，仅在两个工程管区内，就发现了有二百一十八处桥涵需要修改，为国家节省了投资一百四十九万元。五十三岁的王传爵老工程师，在线路改线等方面曾提出十几项合理化建议。由于他的建议，取消了大源村隧道工程。这座隧道是全线第四座大隧道，长六百零八公尺，共减少土石方五十四万三千公方，缩短线路三百零六公尺，计节省工程费一百九十八万元多。
    福建的物产极为丰富。拿木材来说，它是我国四大林区之一，拥有森林面积二百三十多万公顷，木材总蓄量达一亿二千万立方公尺。最适宜建筑用的杉木，在这里二十年即可成材。鹰厦铁路通车后，不仅福建的木材可以大量支援全国各地工业建设，而且各种矿藏也可以大力开采，源源外运。历来因交通闭塞不能外运的山区富饶的土特产品，和亚热带盛产的水果，鱼产，也可以扩大销路。
    我国第一个五年计划中，规定鹰厦铁路1957年修到福建省永安附近，计四百四十三公里。现在，鹰厦铁路经过一年零十个月，已提前于今年“八一”节铺轨到永安车站。目前，铺轨列车正沿着新筑起的路基，向厦门前进！预计今年年底，正线可以完成铺轨任务。
    随着工程节节向南推进，鹰厦铁路逐段开办临时营业。目前鹰潭至南平之间，除忙碌的工程列车向前运送钢轨、枕木、机械和其它工程材料外，还有满载货运的列车日夜奔忙。邵武，是鹰厦铁路进入福建的第一个中心车站，也是闽北九个县的物资集散地。这里，天天有来自闽江上游的富屯溪、建溪流域和山区里的木材、大米、毛竹、香菇、笋干、纸张、生猪、茶叶、莲子和药材等土特产品装车外运。来自上海等地的大批肥田粉、建筑器材等物资，也源源由鹰潭转道运到铁路沿线的资溪、光泽、邵武等县，支援山区的生产建设和供应山区人民的生活需要。
    鹰厦铁路的修建，大大鼓舞了沿线人民的生产热情。光泽、邵武两县沿线人民最近新修了四百多公里的公路和山区便道，把许多乡村同火车站连接起来。沿线农业社根据现在交通便利条件的新情况，积极发展农业和多种经济产物。光泽县有二百多个农业、林业、牧业生产合作社，纷纷修订了原来的生产计划、提高生产指标。邵武县境内铁路两侧地区有十八个乡镇的农业社，除保证完成今年的增产任务外，还因地制宜地发展养鱼、种植瓜果和薯类等副业生产，以供给来往旅客食用。闽北沿线各县积极垦荒造林，面积达五万八千多亩。（附图片）
