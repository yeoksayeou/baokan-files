Autumn deepens with light clouds and a high sky; Beijing is at its most beautiful season.

Facing the western suburbs, on the tree-lined, smooth, and wide roads, cars flow like water. China's diligent hosts accompany foreign friends into the magnificent gates of the Summer Palace. Here are: Sudanese women from the African coast wearing long white veils, Japanese female haiku poets in colorful kimonos, members of parliament from the great Ganges River valley, and brave old Yugoslav partisans. Archaeologists from under the pyramids bring greetings from the ancient Nile, and journalists from Cairo bring news of the African storm. Pakistan's valiant soccer players walk alongside the gentle musicians of the German Berlin Police Orchestra, while poets from faraway Iceland and artists from Mexico walk in side by side. The famous peace warriors, the white-haired Johnson couple, and the old friends of the Chinese people, the William Wenderoth couple, revisit the old place, and they see that some of the pavilions and towers of the Summer Palace have been repainted. A Buddhist delegation in deep yellow robes attracts attention. Ambassadors from various countries stationed in Beijing also arrive with their wives and children. Soviet Ambassador Yudin constantly greets acquaintances in the crowd. Yesterday, guests from more than fifty countries celebrated National Day with the people of Beijing, and today they come to admire the beautiful scenery of Longevity Hill and Kunming Lake.

Cheers and applause erupt as Vice Chairman Zhu De and Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling accompany Indonesian President Sukarno. Premier Zhou Enlai and the host of today's garden party, Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen, greet them at the entrance of the lounge. Nepalese Prime Minister Acharya and his wife also arrive. Premier Zhou and Mayor Peng Zhen cordially accompany them on a tour of the Summer Palace's famous historical sites.

Passing through the colorful Hundred Flower Terrace, President Sukarno arrives at the Chinese Painting Room. Here are displayed the works of some Chinese painters since liberation. On the uniquely Chinese snow-white rice paper, Qi Baishi's transparent shrimp seem to be swimming, and Chen Banding's white daffodils seem to exude a faint fragrance. Wang Geyi's purple lychees, watery and as if about to drip. The little lambs are jumping, the shepherdess is smiling, and the Miao girls happily hold portraits of Chairman Mao... Premier Zhou says with a smile: "You are a famous connoisseur, please take a look at these paintings. Do you like them?" President Sukarno praises these works with the eyes of an expert, stopping in front of some paintings from time to time, putting on his glasses to admire them carefully. He especially likes the old man Qi Baishi's shrimp. He had already selected the precious works of this famous Chinese painter for his collection.

A burst of melodious string and bamboo music leads the distinguished guests to the Grand Theater where the Empress Dowager Cixi used to watch operas. As a piece ends, applause breaks out. Suddenly, the cadenced Indonesian music rings out. Four handsome boys in Indonesian costumes, twirling light silk umbrellas, accompany four beautiful girls, dancing with pretty silk scarves, gracefully taking the stage. Their soft dance, their beautiful fingers, their light steps, their affectionate eyes, and their gently shaking headdresses transport us to the beautiful moonlit night of Indonesia. President Sukarno walks onto the stage and dances to the music. Premier Zhou and Mayor Peng Zhen also clap their hands and tap their feet, keeping time. At this time, applause, laughter, music, and cheers from on and off the stage become one. Everyone cheers for the beautiful music and dance of Indonesia, for the Chinese girls' vivid performances, and for the friendship between China and Indonesia!

At this moment, the rumble of engines vibrates people's hearts. Squadrons of silver swallows sweep across the sky. This is a special performance for President Sukarno, Prime Minister Acharya, and other distinguished guests. Many foreign friends ask with great interest: "Are these jet planes made by the new China itself?"

Now, President Sukarno and the Prime Minister of Nepal arrive on the jasmine-filled corridor. On both sides of the corridor, young men and women of ethnic minorities in national costumes come forward to pay their respects to President Sukarno and the Prime Minister of Nepal. Mazehai, a sixteen-year-old from Lhasa, blushes and runs up to the Nepalese Prime Minister to say hello. Premier Zhou smiles and introduces to the Prime Minister: "This is your closest neighbor." A three-year-old girl, Liu Xinhua, waves her small hand and shouts "Long live," welcoming foreign dignitaries with her innocent smile.

After resting at the Listening to Orioles Hall, the President, Prime Minister, and some foreign guests boarded two dragon boats parked on Kunming Lake. The yellow and blue dragon boats, with palace lanterns hanging in front and behind, and canopies and dragon flags spread on the tops of the boats, are like two yellow and blue swimming dragons, about to fly across the water. President Sukarno thoughtfully helps Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling board the yellow dragon boat. Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman Zhu De, and Mayor Peng Zhen also board the boat. Premier Zhou accompanies the Prime Minister of Nepal and his wife onto the other blue dragon boat. The dragon boats sway on the green lake. Looking at the scenery of the Summer Palace from the lake offers a different flavor. Amidst the lush green, the blue tiles and red beams are hidden, and the vermilion Tower of Buddhist Incense and the golden Hall of Dispelling Clouds are bathed in the setting sun, creating a magnificent scene. Songs rise from the lake, some boys and girls are singing Indonesian songs, listen, these are such familiar sounds:

"Hello, hello, Bandung, the capital of Priangan;
Hello, hello, Bandung, the city you deserve to remember,
It has been a long time since we met you, now you have become a sea of ​​fire!
Come, come, we must take her back!"

This is after the Dutch colonialists occupied Bandung after World War II, the Indonesian people missed Bandung, singing this song to encourage the people around Bandung to take back Bandung as soon as possible. President Sukarno and some Indonesian parliamentarians stood up and sang this heroic song of resistance to the colonialists together, which sounds so cordial to us!

The Scottish national poet Robert Burns once sang:

"For a' that, and a' that,
It's coming yet for a' that,
That Man to Man, the world o'er,
Shall brothers be for a' that."!

For him, this was just a beautiful ideal. But in today's Summer Palace, it is like a paradise for realizing this ideal. In front of and behind the mountains, by the lake, in the pavilions, Germans and Belgians, Koreans and French, Sudanese housewives and Yugoslav generals... everywhere they are talking, dancing, and laughing. A beautiful round dance music plays, French, British, Soviet, German, Polish, and Italians, gently whistle and dance a light waltz. Even two Japanese women wearing wooden clogs follow the music and dance with wooden clogs.

Under the jasmine corridor, in front of the Listening to Orioles Hall, a group of Chinese dancers meet with the actors of the Indonesian Bali dance troupe. They express their close friendship through dance. At the repeated invitations of the Chinese hosts, the enthusiastic Balinese female dancers performed the fascinating Balinese dance.

A burst of loud laughter floated from the Stone Boat. There, the boys and girls of the Central Academy of Drama are dancing vigorously, and a tall foreign guest enters. The students ask and find out that he is Hamroush, a reporter from the Egyptian Republic newspaper. As soon as the news spreads, the boys and girls forget about dancing, swarm over and shake hands with the Egyptian guest, warmly saying to the Egyptian guest: "The Chinese people support the Egyptian people." Then, everyone shouts in unison: "Suez", "Nasser", "Mao Zedong", "China", "Egypt". The Egyptian guest also clenched his fists and shouted with everyone in Chinese "China Egypt", "China Egypt". How much close friendship is contained in this simple and enthusiastic language!

The Arab trade union delegation arrived at the elegant Garden of Harmonious Interests. The Garden of Harmonious Interests has a lake of autumn water and half a lake of lotus leaves, which is full of the flavor of Jiangnan. The weeping willows on the shore sway in the breeze, gracefully showing the tallness and vigor of the half-cut lonely pine of the Zhizhi Bridge. The "Drinking Green Pavilion" opposite Hanyuan Hall, where the Empress Dowager Cixi used to fish, has become a place for guests from London, Paris, Rome, Moscow, and Brussels to express their feelings. Next to the corridor of the Garden of Harmonious Interests, guests from Singapore are enthusiastically playing the game of dropping handkerchiefs with the Chinese Young Pioneers. The guests' movements are very agile, and it is difficult for the children to catch them. In the house, a cappella "He Hou Scolding the Palace" by students of the Chinese Opera School won a lot of applause from Singaporean guests.

Going uphill from the Garden of Harmonious Interests is the back mountain, which is particularly quiet today. The sound of pine waves blowing in the autumn wind, and laughter is often heard on the road. Guests often stop for a while when going up the mountain to enjoy the scenery of the lake and mountains. In front of them is the beautiful Kunming Lake. Tourists are connected on the lake embankment, and the girls' new clothes are reflected in the water. There are little painted boats on the water, and the blue waves are rippling. Behind are the looming mountains. The city of Beijing is clearly visible. Amidst the green trees, the golden-roofed palaces, the tall building frames, and the tall chimneys are particularly eye-catching. Chinese painters sketch in twos and threes under the trees in front of the mountain, and Kemal, the deputy head of the Arab trade union delegation, walks to the painters and says while looking at the paintings: "Chinese art is world-renowned."

Many foreign friends had a great time and had a great time, and they praised the architecture and scenery of the Summer Palace. Chinese classical folk music is being played on the steps of Hanxu Hall on the Dragon King Temple, and the Mexican painter Ajixi is leaning against the chair, intoxicated in the elegant string and bamboo music. He said: "Many places in China have scenery like my hometown Mexico." He said that he had been to Hankou, Shanghai, and Tianjin, and everywhere he felt that the Chinese people were so happy and living with great confidence. He praised that the sky in China always seemed to be blue and bright. At the same time, an Australian female writer, Cushak, was also praising it. She said: "I have visited many countries' gardens and palaces, but I have never seen a palace and garden so beautiful." She pointed to the clusters of light yellow chrysanthemums and said: "What beautiful chrysanthemums, as soft and beautiful as sunshine!"

The Summer Palace is full of friendship and smiles. It's evening. The afterglow of the setting sun shines brightly on Kunming Lake. A gust of autumn wind gently blows from the lake, which already makes people feel a little cool. However, the distinguished guests who are still in high spirits are still driving light boats and rippling in the heart of the lake. How much they are attached to this beautiful lake and mountain and friends! (Attached picture)

    满园秋色迎嘉宾
    本报记者
    云淡天高，北京已然深秋。这是一年中最美好的季节。
    朝向西郊，在那林荫复盖的、平整宽坦的马路上，车如流水。中国的殷勤的主人们，陪着外国朋友，走进颐和园金碧辉煌的大门。这里有：披着白色长纱、来自非洲海岸的苏丹妇女，有穿着彩色和服的日本女俳句诗人。有从伟大的恒河流域来的国会议员们，有南斯拉夫勇敢的老游击队员。金字塔下的考古学家捎来古老尼罗河的问候，开罗的新闻记者带来非洲风暴的消息。巴基斯坦雄纠纠的足球队员和德国柏林警察乐团温文尔雅的音乐师走在一起，遥远的冰岛诗人和墨西哥的艺术家并肩走进来。著名的和平战士，白发苍苍的约翰逊夫妇和中国人民的老朋友文幼章夫妇旧地重游，他们看到颐和园的一些亭台楼阁又已换上新的颜色。身着深黄袈衣的佛教代表团引起人们的注意。驻北京的各国使节带着他们的夫人、孩子也来到了。苏联的尤金大使不断和人群中的熟人打着招呼。来自五十多个国家的外宾，昨天刚和北京人民一起欢度国庆，今天又来欣赏万寿山和昆明湖的美丽的风光。
    一阵阵的欢呼，一阵阵的鼓掌，朱德副主席、宋庆龄副委员长陪着印度尼西亚苏加诺总统来到了。周恩来总理和今天游园会的主人——北京市彭真市长在休息室门口迎接着。尼泊尔首相阿查里雅和夫人也来到了。周总理和彭真市长亲切地陪着他们游览颐和园的名胜古迹。
    穿过姹紫嫣红的百花台，苏加诺总统来到了国画室。这里陈列着解放以后中国一些画家的作品。在中国特有的雪白的宣纸上，齐白石的透明的虾仿佛在游动，陈半丁的白色的水仙仿佛散发阵阵幽香。王个簃的紫色荔枝，水汪汪地仿佛要滴出水来。那小羊羔正在跳跃，那牧羊女正在微笑，那苗族的姑娘幸福地捧着毛主席的像片……周总理笑着说：“你是个名鉴赏家，请你看一看这些画吧，你喜欢它们吗？”苏加诺总统带着专家的眼光赞誉着这些作品，不时在一些画幅前停下来，带上眼镜仔细欣赏。他特别喜欢齐白石老人的那幅虾。在他的藏画集里，早选进中国这位著名画家的珍品了。
    一阵阵悠扬的丝竹音乐，把贵宾们引到慈禧太后当年在这里看戏的大戏台前。一曲方终，掌声四起。突然，那抑扬顿挫的印度尼西亚的音乐声响起了。四个印度尼西亚装束的漂亮的男孩子，旋转着轻俏的绸伞，伴着四个艳丽的女孩子，舞着俏丽的纱巾，翩翩出台了。那柔和的舞姿，那美妙的手指，那轻巧的足踏，那含情脉脉的眼神，那轻轻颤动的头饰，把我们带到印度尼西亚优美的月夜。苏加诺总统走到舞台上，随着乐声，舞蹈起来。周总理和彭真市长也随着用手鼓掌，用脚点地，打着节拍。这时，台上台下，掌声、笑声、音乐声、喝采声响成一片。大家为印度尼西亚优美的音乐和舞蹈而喝采，为中国的女孩子表演得那么唯妙唯肖而喝采，为中国和印度尼西亚的友谊而喝采！
    这时，隆隆的机声，震动着人的心弦。一队队银燕掠过天空。这是专门给苏加诺总统、阿查里雅首相和其他贵宾们表演的。许多外国朋友很有兴趣地问：“这是新中国自己制造的喷气式吗？”
    现在，苏加诺总统和尼泊尔首相来到了布满茉莉的长廊上。长廊两旁，不时有穿着民族服装的少数民族男女青年，走上来给苏加诺总统和尼泊尔首相致敬。从拉萨来的十六岁的马泽海红着脸跑到尼泊尔首相跟前问好。周总理笑着向首相介绍：“这是你的最近的邻居”。三岁的小女孩刘新华扬着小手喊“万岁”，用她的天真无邪的微笑欢迎着外国的贵宾。
    总统、首相和一些外宾在听鹂馆休息以后，他们又登上了昆明湖上停着的两只龙舟。黄色和蓝色的龙舟，前后悬着宫灯，船顶上张着宝盖和龙旗，仿佛两条黄色和蓝色的游龙，正欲在水面上乘波飞去。苏加诺总统关心地搀着宋庆龄副委员长登上黄色的龙舟。刘少奇委员长和朱德副主席和彭真市长也一起上了船。周总理陪着尼泊尔首相和夫人登上另一条蓝色的龙舟。龙舟在绿色的湖面荡漾。从湖上看颐和园的景色，另有一番风味。浓绿中掩映着碧瓦红梁，朱红的佛香阁和金黄的排云殿沐浴在斜阳中，气象万千。湖上的歌声起来了，一些男女孩子在唱着印度尼西亚的歌曲，听，这是多么熟悉的声音：
    “哈啰，哈啰，万隆，勃良安州的首府；
    哈啰，哈啰，万隆，你值得回忆的城市，
    已经许久不跟你会面了，现在你成了一片火海！
    来吧，来吧，我们一定要把她夺回来！”
    这是第二次世界大战以后荷兰殖民者强占万隆以后，印度尼西亚人民怀念万隆，唱着这首歌子，鼓励万隆周围的人民早日收回万隆。苏加诺总统和一些印度尼西亚的议员们都站起来，一起唱着这首反抗殖民者的英勇的歌，这在我们听来，也是多么的亲切啊！
    苏格兰的民族诗人罗伯特·伯恩斯曾经这样吟咏过：
    “然而，这一天就快到来，
    四海之内人与人，
    终将成为兄弟一般”！
    在他，这还只是一个美妙的理想。但在今天的颐和园，宛然是实现这个理想的乐园。山前山后，湖边亭中，德国人和比利时人，朝鲜人和法国人，苏丹的主妇和南斯拉夫的将军……到处都在交谈，都在跳舞，都在欢笑。优美的圆乐曲奏起来了，法国人、英国人、苏联人、德国人、波兰人、意大利人，轻轻吹着口哨，跳起轻快的华尔滋舞。连二位穿着木屐的日本妇女，也随着音乐，踏着木屐跳起舞来。
    茉莉花廊下，听鹂馆前，一群中国的舞蹈演员们和印度尼西亚峇厘舞蹈团的演员们会见了。他们用舞蹈来表达亲密的友情。热情的峇厘女舞蹈家在中国主人的一再邀请下表演了令人神往的峇厘舞蹈。
    一阵阵响亮的欢笑声从石舫上飘荡过来。那里，中央戏剧学院的男女孩子跳舞正跳得起劲，一位高大的外国客人进来了。学生们一问知道是埃及共和国报的记者哈姆路希。消息一传开，男女孩子们都顾不得跳了，拥过来抢着和埃及客人握手，热情地对埃及客人说：“中国人民支持埃及人民。”接着，大家就高声齐喊：“苏伊士”、“纳赛尔”、“毛泽东”、“中国”、“埃及”。埃及客人也紧握着拳头和大家一起用中国话喊“中国埃及”、“中国埃及”。这简单热情的语言包含着多少亲密的情谊！
    阿拉伯工会代表团来到了景色幽雅的谐趣园。谐趣园一湖秋水，半湖荷叶，饶有江南风味，岸上垂柳，在微风中摇曳，婀娜多姿，更显出知鱼桥那半截孤松的挺拔、苍劲。涵远堂对面的“饮绿榭”当年西太后钓鱼的地方，今天成了从伦敦、巴黎、罗马、莫斯科、布鲁塞尔来的客人们遣情尽兴的地方。在谐趣园的回廊旁边，新加坡来的客人兴致勃勃地跟中国的红领巾们做着丢手帕的游戏，客人的动作很灵巧，孩子们很难捉住他们。房子里，中国戏曲学校学生的一曲清唱“贺后骂殿”，博得新加坡客人们的不少掌声。
    从谐趣园上坡就是后山，今天的后山特别幽静。秋风吹来松涛的啸声，路上时时传来人们的欢笑。客人们上山往往要停留一会，欣赏一下湖光山色。在他们前面是美丽的昆明湖。湖堤上游人相接，姑娘的新衣倒映水中。水面上点点画艇，碧波荡漾。后面是隐现的群山。北京市历历在目。绿树掩映间，金色屋顶的宫殿，高高的建筑架和挺立的烟囱特别醒目。中国的画家三三两两在山前树下写生，阿拉伯工会代表团的副团长凯末尔走到画家身边一面看画一面说：“中国的艺术举世闻名”。
    许多外国朋友玩得高兴，玩得痛快，他们盛赞颐和园的建筑和景色。在龙王庙那边涵虚堂的台阶上正在奏着中国古典风味的民族音乐，墨西哥画家阿吉锡斜倚在椅子上，沉醉在幽雅的丝竹声中去了。他说：“中国有很多地方的风光像我的家乡墨西哥。”他说他到过汉口、上海、天津，到处都感到中国人都是那么高兴，都在很有信心地生活着。他称赞中国的天空好像永远是蓝色的、明亮的。同一个时候，一位澳大利亚的女作家古沙克也在赞美着。她说：“我参观过很多国家的花园和宫殿，可是，我从没有看到一个宫殿和花园有这样漂亮。她指着那一丛丛的淡黄的菊花说：“多漂亮的菊花，就像阳光一样柔和美丽！”
    颐和园里到处是友谊，到处是微笑。时候已到傍晚了。夕阳的余辉，灿烂地照射在昆明湖上。阵阵秋风从湖上轻轻吹过，已经使人感到有些凉意。而游兴正浓的贵宾们依然驾起一叶叶的轻舟荡漾在湖心。他们是多么依恋着这美丽的湖山和朋友们啊！（附图片）
