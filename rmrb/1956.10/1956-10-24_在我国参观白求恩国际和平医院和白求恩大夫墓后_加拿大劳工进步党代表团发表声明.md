Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd: The Canadian Labour Progressive Party delegation, invited to attend the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, returned to Beijing by plane yesterday afternoon after visiting various places in China.

The delegation visited the Bethune International Peace Hospital and Dr. Bethune's tomb in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, on October 3rd, and issued a statement regarding their visit to these two places.

The full text of the statement is as follows:

We have made a memorable visit to a memorial park and a hospital in North China. Such a visit is forever worthy of commemoration for the people of China and Canada, as it symbolizes the eternal friendship between us.

Canadian compatriots and Chinese brothers and sisters: When we paid our respects at Dr. Bethune's tomb, led by the Mayor of Shijiazhuang, and when we visited the Bethune International Peace Hospital, guided by the President of the hospital, this medical institution was established by this great Canadian in 1938 in the war-torn mountains of China. The feelings of love and brotherhood that filled our hearts were profound. We believe that many of our compatriots will feel the same way. One of the delegates, McEwen, the editor of the "Pacific Tribune" in Vancouver, Canada, is writing a detailed account of the visit, and we would like to publish this statement to the people of Canada and China through newspapers.

Dr. Bethune rests in a grove of cedars, reminiscent of his birthplace and where he grew up, northern Ontario. Beside him rests an Indian doctor, Dr. Kotnis, who took over Bethune's work when Dr. Bethune tragically passed away in November 1939, and he was only thirty-two years old when he died. The two graves face a large red cross.

Bethune rests in a lovely memorial park, which is also the final resting place of fallen soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Every Sunday, tens of thousands of Chinese citizens come to the park to visit, where they see the monuments to the heroes and the simple tombstones, recalling the great price China paid in the struggle for national freedom.

The park has a memorial hall, which displays memorabilia of the fallen soldiers of the North China People's Liberation Army - poems, diaries, and hometown souvenirs of ordinary soldiers. There are also photographs of Dr. Bethune, showing him performing surgery on soldiers at the front lines (often unable to obtain the medicine he needed due to the Western blockade). His haggard face tells us of his suffering and his spirit of dedication.

Not far from this young and developing city of half a million residents, which is building a socialist life with abundant energy and courage, stands the Bethune International Peace Hospital. Yes, besides the hospital belonging to the People's Army which is dedicating itself to the cause of peace, what other country's military hospital would have such a name – "Peace Hospital"!

The president told us how our Canadian comrade founded this hospital in 1938, practically under the bombardment of the Japanese imperialist army, and how he was forced to move it eight times, crossing thousands of kilometers of territory, until the national liberation war won victory in 1949, and the hospital finally found peace and security.

May it always be so! May humanitarianism be promoted in peace because the people have triumphed!

The hospital has eight hundred beds, a nursing school and an affiliated medical college. The hospital has a staff of 1,200. It is a modern hospital, very well equipped, and all the staff know the deeds of the founder of their hospital, and when you walk into the main office building, his portrait looks right at you.

We thought to ourselves, "If Bethune were still here, how happy he would be to come here today! How glad he would be! Moreover, as a tireless innovator, how he would run around, examining shortcomings and correcting mistakes."

Deep confidence in the people, continuous and collective struggle for progress, this quality is the spirit of China, the principle of the Communist Party of China, and also the ideal of all the staff of Bethune Hospital.

We talked to doctors, patients, students, nurses and doctor's assistants, all of whom said: "May the friendship between our peoples grow. We thank you for Dr. Bethune. We must strive to learn from his example of serving the people."

This place will always be connected to our homeland of Canada. When we spoke at Bethune's tomb, when we spoke to the young, cheerful and friendly young people, as well as soldiers, nurses, medical students and hospital staff who gathered at the door to welcome us and see us off, we tried to express this meaning.

After we visited and talked with the mayor, representatives of the people, leading comrades of the Communist Party, youth and women, and based on our familiar democratic traditions and feelings of the Canadian people, we are more firmly convinced of our position: the Canadian government's persistent and unreasonable refusal to recognize the People's Republic of China is not an act that represents Canadian interests.

What could better prove this point than our visit: diplomatic relations and trade and cultural exchanges based on friendship and mutual respect between our two peoples are beneficial to both China and Canada!

When we left Bethune's tomb and his magnificent hospital, we were convinced that Canada will soon recognize People's China. Please allow us to say this: our country needs to establish such diplomatic relations more than this emerging, vibrant and united China that is moving towards socialism, and needs all the benefits brought about by the establishment of diplomatic relations more.

As representatives of the Labour Progressive Party, and in the present situation, we humbly say, as spokespersons for the democratic and peace-loving people of Canada, we urge our government to take an independent stand for the sake of true national interests, to exchange diplomatic envoys and develop trade relations with the People's Republic of China as soon as possible, and to submit to the United Nations: the government of the People's Republic, as the spokesperson and leader of 600 million people - a quarter of mankind, should obtain its legitimate status in the United Nations.

We extend our greetings to the government of the People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China. Dr. Bethune's name will last forever, and Canada will inherit this glory.

We extend our greetings to the Mayor of Shijiazhuang, the heads of various organizations, the comrades of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the President and staff of the Bethune International Peace Hospital. We thank you for the kindness and warm hospitality you have given us. We know that this is a manifestation of friendship and enthusiasm for the Canadian people, just as Bethune did for the Chinese people. Bethune's heroic work is a manifestation of his internationalist spirit and his love for mankind - a manifestation of the glorious qualities that an excellent Communist Party member and a true patriot should possess.

    在我国参观白求恩国际和平医院和白求恩大夫墓后
    加拿大劳工进步党代表团发表声明
    新华社23日讯　应邀参加中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的加拿大劳工进步党代表团，在我国各地参观访问后，昨天下午乘飞机回到北京。
    代表团10月3日在河北省石家庄参观了白求恩国际和平医院和白求恩大夫墓，并且就参观这两处地方发表了声明。
    声明全文如下：
    我们在华北的一个纪念公园和一所医院进行了一次难忘的访问。这样的访问对于中国和加拿大的人民是永远值得纪念的，它象征着我们之间的永恒的友谊。
    加拿大的同胞们和中国的兄弟姐妹们：当我们在石家庄市长的带领下拜谒白求恩大夫的墓时，当我们在白求恩国际和平医院院长的引导下参观这所为这位伟大的加拿大人于1938年在中国的被战争洗劫过的山腰中建立起来的医疗院时，那种充满于我们内心中的敬爱和兄弟之谊的情感是深切的。我们这种心情，我们想，也当然将为我们很多同胞所同样地感受到。代表团的一位代表——加拿大温哥华“太平洋论坛报”的编辑麦克尤恩正在写一篇详细的拜访记，而我们则想通过报刊，向加拿大和中国的人民发表这个声明。
    白求恩大夫长眠在一片杉木丛林中，这片丛林使人回忆起他的出生和长大的地方——安大略的北部地区。在他的旁边长眠着一位印度的医生——柯蒂尼斯大夫，这位印度大夫当1939年11月白求恩大夫悲惨地去世后就继承了白求恩的工作，而他在去世时只有三十二岁。两座坟面对着一个大的红十字架。
    白求恩长眠的地方是在一个可爱的纪念公园里，这里也安葬着人民解放军的阵亡战士。每逢星期日，成千成万的中国公民到公园里来游览，他们在这里看到英雄们的纪念碑和朴素的墓碑而联想起中国在为了争取民族自由所付出的代价是多么大的。
    公园有个纪念堂，里面陈列着华北解放军阵亡战士的纪念品——诗歌、日记和普通战士的家乡纪念品等。这里也有白求恩大夫的照片，照片中的他正在前线上为战士们动手术（由于西方国家的封锁，他经常得不到他所需的医药）。他的憔悴的脸孔告诉我们他的痛苦经历和他的献身事业的精神。
    在这个正以充沛的精力和勇气建设社会主义生活的拥有五十万居民的年青的和还在发展的城市内的一个不远的地方，矗立着白求恩国际和平医院。是的，除了正为着和平事业而献身于和平的人民军队所属的医院外，难道还有其他国家的军事医院会有这样的命名——“和平医院”！
    院长向我们叙述了我们的加拿大同志是怎样地于1938年，简直是在日本帝国主义军队的炮火轰击下，创立了这所医院，他又怎样地被迫把它作过八次的迁移，穿过上千公里的国土，直到1949年民族解放战争获得胜利之后，这所医院终于得到和平和安全。
    祝福它能够永远如此！祝福人道主义由于人民得到了胜利而得以在和平中光大起来！
    这所医院有八百张病床，一所护士学校和一所附属的医学院。医院的职员共有一千二百人。它是一所现代化的医院，设备非常好，所有的职员都知道他们的医院的创立者的事迹，当你走进总办公楼的时候，他的肖像正好看着你。
    我们自己这么想：“如果白求恩还在的话，他今天会多么地喜欢到这里来呀！他会感到多么地高兴呀！何况在他作为一个不懈的革新者，他将如何四处奔走，检查缺点和改正错误呀”。
    对人民深怀信心，为争取进步而不断地和集体地进行斗争，这种品质就是中国的精神，就是中国共产党的准则，也就是白求恩医院全体工作人员的理想。
    我们和医师、病人、学生、护士以及医生助理等都谈了话，他们都说：“愿我们人民间的友谊增长。我们为白求恩大夫向你们致谢。我们要努力学习他的为人民服务的榜样”。
    这块地方将永远和我们祖国加拿大相连。当我们在白求恩墓旁说话时，当我们在对聚在门口欢迎我们和欢送我们的年青、快活而和气的青年们，以及兵士、护士、医学生和医院工作人员说话时，我们努力把这个意思表达出来。
    在我们访问了市长、市人民代表、共产党领导同志、青年和妇女并和他们谈话之后，以及根据我们所熟悉的加拿大人民的民主传统和情感，对于我们的主张，我们更加坚定不移：加拿大政府在坚持着蛮不讲理地拒绝承认中华人民共和国的政策并不是代表加拿大利益的行为。
    还有什么东西能比我们这次访问更能证明这样的道理呢：基于我们两国人民之间的友谊和相互尊重的基础上将建立起来的外交关系和贸易及文化的交流关系对于中加两国是有裨益的！
    当我们离开白求恩墓地和他的壮丽的医院时，我们深信加拿大不久必将承认人民中国。请允许我们这样说吧：我国比之于这个走向社会主义的新兴的、生气勃勃的和团结一致的中国更为需要建立这种外交关系，更为需要由于外交关系的建立而带来的一切好处。
    作为劳工进步党的代表，并且在现在的场合下，我们谦虚地说，作为加拿大的民主的和爱好和平的人民的发言人，我们要敦促我们的政府为了真正的民族利益应采取独立的立场，从速与中华人民共和国交换外交使节和开展贸易关系，并向联合国提出：人民共和国政府作为六亿人民——人类四分之一的发言人和领袖应在联合国方面取得它的合法地位。
    我们特向中华人民共和国政府和中国共产党致意，白求恩大夫的名字永垂不朽，加拿大承受这个光荣。
    我们特向石家庄的市长，各社团的首长们，中国共产党石家庄市委员会的同志们和白求恩国际和平医院的院长和工作人员们致意，我们感谢你们所给予我们的盛情和热诚的招待。我们知道这是对加拿大人民的友谊和热情的表现，正如白求恩对中国人民所作的一样。白求恩的英勇劳动是他的国际主义精神和对人类的热爱的表现——一个优秀共产党员和真正爱国者所应具有的光辉品质的表现。
