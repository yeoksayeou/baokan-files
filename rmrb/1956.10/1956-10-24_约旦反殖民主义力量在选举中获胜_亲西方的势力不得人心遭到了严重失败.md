Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd, Amman Dispatch: The results of the Jordanian parliamentary elections were announced on the evening of October 22nd. Parties advocating for the strengthening of Arab unity and opposing colonialism have won a majority of seats in parliament. Pro-Western forces have suffered a severe defeat.

It has been announced that the distribution of the forty seats in parliament is as follows: National Socialist Party, eleven seats; Arab Constitutional Party, four seats; Muslim Brotherhood, four seats; National Front, three seats; Arab Ba'ath Party, two seats; Liberation Party, two seats; Arab Palestinian United Party, two seats; Independents, twelve seats.

The previous parliament was elected in 1954, when British General Glubb was in power in Jordan, and pro-Western forces dominated the parliament. Because members of some parties obstructed the government from implementing policies to revise the British-Jordanian treaty and strengthen Arab unity, this parliament was dissolved in June of this year.

The National Socialist Party, which won the most seats in this election, put forward a program advocating for the abolition of the British-Jordanian treaty, opposition to the Baghdad Pact, and strengthening of Arab unity during the campaign. Britain relies on the British-Jordanian treaty to maintain air force bases in Jordan and uses so-called financial aid to control Jordan.

The right-wing Arab Constitutional Party, which dominated the previous parliament and originally held twenty-five seats, only obtained four seats this time.

Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd Dispatch from TASS: Middle Eastern public opinion believes that the outcome of the Jordanian parliamentary elections is a victory for anti-colonialist forces.

Khaled Mohieddin, editor-in-chief of the Egyptian newspaper "Al Misaa," said that the results of the Jordanian election prove that candidates who support the Arab people's national liberation movement have been successful. The results show that "the Jordanian people demand that the country be liberated from imperialist oppression and unanimously vote for those who advocate for improving the people's living standards and creating a better future."

Mohieddin pointed out that the victory of left-wing forces in the election is a serious blow to the colonialists' position.

Syrian newspapers emphasized that anti-colonialist forces had won the election, and that "supporters of national liberation policies occupy a majority of seats in parliament."

The Lebanese newspaper "Al Shark" wrote that most of the new members of the Jordanian parliament elected on October 21 advocate for strengthening ties with Arab countries, which would be able to abolish the British-Jordanian treaty.

The Lebanese newspaper "Al Nida" pointed out: "The Jordanian people have once again won a victory over the Baghdad Pact and (British General) Glubb Pasha." This election result proves that Jordan is determined to follow an independent path.

    约旦反殖民主义力量在选举中获胜
    亲西方的势力不得人心遭到了严重失败
    据新华社23日讯　安曼消息：约旦议会选举结果已经在10月22日晚上揭晓。主张加强阿拉伯国家的团结和反对殖民主义的党派获得了议会的多数席位。亲西方的势力遭到了严重失败。
    据宣布，议会的四十个席位的分配如下：国家社会党十一席，阿拉伯制宪党四席，穆斯林兄弟会四席，全国阵线三席，阿拉伯复兴党二席，解放党二席，阿拉伯巴勒斯坦联合党二席，独立人士十二席。
    上届议会是在1954年选 出来的，当时英国将军格拉布在约旦掌权，亲西方势力在议会中占优势。由于某些党派的议员阻挠政府执行修改英国—约旦条约和加强阿拉伯团结的政策，这届议会在今年6月间被解散。
    在这次选举中获得席位最多的政党——国家社会党在竞选中提出了主张废除英国—约旦条约、反对巴格达条约和加强阿拉伯团结的纲领。英国凭借英国—约旦条约在约旦占有空军基地，并且利用所谓财政援助对约旦进行控制。
    在上届议会里占统治地位的右翼的阿拉伯制宪党原来有二十五个席位，这次只得到四个议席。
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社讯：中东国家舆论认为，约旦议会选举的结果是反殖民主义力量的胜利。
    埃及“晚报”总编辑哈立德·毛希丁说，约旦这次选举的结果证明支持阿拉伯人民的民族解放运动的候选人获得了成功。结果表明，“约旦人民要求把国家从帝国主义的压迫下解放出来，并且一致投票赞成那些主张提高人民的生活水平和创造美好的将来的人”。
    毛希丁指出，在选举中左派势力的胜利，就是对殖民者的立场一个严重的打击。
    叙利亚各报着重指出，反殖民主义力量在选举中胜利了，“民族解放政策的拥护者在议会里占大多数席位”。
    黎巴嫩“东方报”写道，10月21日所选出的约旦议会新议员大多数都是主张加强同阿拉伯国家的联系，这种加强能够取消英国—约旦条约。
    黎巴嫩“邻人报”指出：“约旦人民又一次获得了对巴格达条约和（英国将军）格拉布帕夏的胜利”。这次选举结果证明了约旦坚决要走独立的道路。
