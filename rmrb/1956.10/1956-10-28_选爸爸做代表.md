Choosing Dad as a Representative
Jin Jin

Mom is going to the voters' group meeting.
I finished dinner with Mom, but Dad hadn't come back yet. The food was almost cold. Mom said Dad must be at some meeting at the factory. I heard Dad say yesterday that the factory was launching a labor competition to welcome this election. Mom washed the dishes and was about to leave. I said:
	"Mom, I want to go too."
Mom disagreed. She said:
	"You just stay at home, review your homework, and don't go out to play."
I didn't agree with Mom either. I said it was boring to be alone at home.
Mom said okay, but don't mess around at the meeting. I nodded with a smile and followed Mom.
The meeting place was next door at Uncle Zhao's house. Everyone was there, all adults, except for me, who was a child.
Uncle Zhao is the group leader. He said the meeting was starting, and first said a few people's names, what jobs they did, and where they lived. When he got to the fifth person, he said:
	"Now let's introduce Liu Daming."
I tugged at Mom's sleeve and said:
	"Mom! He's talking about my dad."
Mom pulled my hand away, turned to look at me, and said softly:
	"I told you not to make trouble, and you're making trouble again."
How is that making trouble? Fine, I won't say anything.
Later, Uncle Zhao asked everyone to give those people some opinions, both good and bad. Everyone gave their opinions, and those who agreed raised their hands.
I didn't know those people, so I didn't raise my hand. I only knew my dad, so I asked:
	"Uncle Zhao, can I give my dad an opinion?"
Uncle Zhao was very nice. He smiled and said:
	"Sure!"
I gave my opinion. I said my dad was good at everything, good at work, healthy, and good at studying, but there was one thing he wasn't good at. I wanted him to buy me a big, colorful leather ball. I've asked him three times, but he hasn't bought it for me yet.
Everyone laughed when they heard me. What's so funny? Mom laughed this time too, but Uncle Zhao was still nice. He said:
	"That's a good opinion. I'll tell your dad."
Everyone agreed to have my dad as a representative. They all raised their hands. My mom didn't raise her hand at first, but when she saw everyone else raising their hands, she raised hers too. I agreed to have my dad as a representative, so I raised my right hand, very high.
This time everyone said to me:
	"What are you raising your hand for? You're just a kid, you're not qualified."
I immediately felt my face getting hot. My face must have been very red, like I had done something wrong, but I still said:
	"I'm already in the second grade, and in five months I'm going to apply to join the Young Pioneers."
Uncle Zhao didn't talk like the others. He said:
	"You have to be eighteen to be qualified to raise your hand. It's still early." He was afraid I'd be embarrassed, so he added: "But it doesn't matter, we'll count you as agreeing too."
On the way home, Mom said with a smile:
	"You kid, you're really naughty."
I didn't agree with Mom. How is that being naughty? What does it matter if I'm young? Didn't Uncle Zhao say that he agreed to me choosing my dad as a representative? That's right.

    选爸爸做代表
    金近
    妈妈要去开选民小组会了。
    我跟妈妈吃完晚饭，爸爸还没有回来呢，饭菜都快凉啦。妈妈说，爸爸一定在厂里开什么会了。昨天我听爸爸说过的，厂里要发起劳动竞赛，就是为了迎接这次选举。妈妈把碗筷洗刷干净，要走了。我说：
      “妈，我也要去。”
    妈妈不同意，她说：
      “你就在家呆着吧，把功课温温好，可别出去玩儿啦。”
    我也不同意妈妈的话，我说，一个人呆在家里多闷啊。
    妈妈说，好吧，可别在会上瞎胡闹。我笑着点点头，就跟着妈妈走了。
    开会的地方就是隔壁老赵叔叔的家里，人都来啦，都是大人，只有我是小孩子。
    老赵叔叔是小组长，他说开会啦，先说了几个人的名字，说他们做什么工作的，住在那里。他说到第五个人的时候，他说：
      “现在介绍一下刘大明。”
    我扯着妈妈的衣角说：
      “妈！他说我的爸爸。”
    妈妈劈开我的手，她回过头来瞅了我一眼，轻轻地说：
    “叫你别闹，你又闹啦。”
    这怎么叫闹呢？好，我就什么也不说。
    后来老赵叔叔叫大伙给那几个人提意见，优点缺点都提。大伙都提了，同意的就举手。
    我不认识那几个人，没有举手，我只知道我爸爸，我就问：
      “老赵叔叔，我给我爸爸提个意见，行吗？”
    老赵叔叔可好呢，他笑着说：
      “行啊！”
    我提啦，我说我爸爸什么都好，工作好，身体好，学习也好，可就是有一点不好，我要他给我买个彩色的大皮球，说过三次啦，可他还没有给我买。
    大伙听了我的话都乐了，这有什么可乐的？妈妈这回子也笑了，还是老赵叔叔好，他说：
      “你这意见提得好，我给你爸爸说吧。”
    大伙同意我爸爸做代表，他们都举手了。我妈妈起先不举手，看到大伙都举了，她也举了起来。我可同意我爸爸做代表，就举起右手来，举得挺高的。
    这回大伙又说我了：
      “你举什么手啊？你这小孩子还不到资格哩。”
    我马上觉得脸上发热，我的脸一定是挺红了，像做错了什么事似的，不过我还说：
      “我都读二年级啦，再过五个月我就要申请入队。”
    老赵叔叔可不像大伙那样地说话，他说：
      “你要到十八岁才有举手的资格，现在还早哩。”他怕我不好意思，又说：“不过不要紧，我们算你也同意。”
    回家的时候，妈妈一边笑着，一边说：
      “你这孩子，你啊，真淘气。”
    我可不同意妈妈的话，这怎么叫淘气呢？年纪小有什么关系，老赵叔叔不是说过的吗？他同意我选我的爸爸做代表，那就对啦。
