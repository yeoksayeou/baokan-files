Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 10th. The "Neues Deutschland" published a commentary on October 9th entitled "Now Is the Time to Act," commenting on contacts and understanding between the two Germanys.

The commentary first mentioned the proposal by the Chairman of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, Mr. Dieckmann, in a recent letter to the President of the West German Bundestag, Mr. Gerstenmaier, suggesting direct negotiations between the parliaments of the two Germanys on a peaceful resolution of the German question. The commentary pointed out: "This proactive move—and it is not the first—will undoubtedly be welcomed by all Germans of goodwill."

The commentary said that the People's Chamber's proposal was submitted at a very appropriate place and time because some members of the West German Bundestag currently hold more realistic political views.

The commentary referred to the official talks held last week by the executive committees of the two Free Democratic Parties of East and West Germany, considering these talks "a step towards a realistic policy on the German question." The commentary pointed out: "Although many differences still exist between the two parties, common ground has been found on many issues."

The commentary said: "We believe that similar results can be achieved through negotiations between the parliaments of the two Germanys. This will greatly contribute to the easing of tensions and the reunification of Germany."

The commentary said that the "Social Democratic News Bulletin" has expressed its approval of such talks. The commentary continued: "One cannot help but ask: why can't the Social Democratic politicians talk with the Socialist Unity Party politicians?" It believes that "talks between the two largest parties in Germany, representing the largest class in Germany—the working class—will inevitably have a much greater impact and much greater significance for the future of Germany."

    “新德意志报”评东西德的接触
    德国爱国者欢迎有助于德国统一的直接谈判
    新华社柏林10日电　“新德意志报”9日以“现在必须行动”为题，评论两个德国之间的接触和谅解。
    评论首先提到德意志民主共和国人民议院主席狄克曼在最近写给西德联邦议院主席格斯登美尔的一封信中所提出的两个德国的议会就德国问题的和平解决进行直接谈判的建议。评论指出：“这个主动行动——它已不是第一次——无疑将受到所有善意的德国人的欢迎。”
    评论说：人民议院的建议递交的地点和时机都是很合适的，因为目前在西德联邦议院中有一些议员已经有了比较现实的政治见解。
    评论谈到东西德两个自由民主党的执行委员会上星期举行的正式会谈，认为这次会谈是“关于德国问题的现实政策的一个步骤”。评论指出：“尽管两党之间还存在着许多分歧，但是在很多问题上已经找到了共同的观点。”
    评论说：“我们相信通过两个德国议会之间的谈判将可以得到类似的结果。这样将会大大有助于紧张局势的缓和和德国的重新统一。”
  评论说：“社会民主新闻公报”已经对这种会谈表示了赞同的态度。评论接着说：“人们不禁要问：为什么社会民主党的政治家不能够同统一社会党的政治家会谈呢？”它认为“代表德国最大的阶级——工人阶级的德国两个最大的政党之间的会谈，必然会对德国的将来有更大得多的影响和更大得多的意义。”
