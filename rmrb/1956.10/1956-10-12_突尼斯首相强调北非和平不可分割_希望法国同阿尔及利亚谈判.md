    Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Paris: Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba said on the 10th, when talking about the Algerian question: "I have not concealed from French leaders the extent of Tunisia's concern about the situation in Algeria, because Tunisia believes that, to a certain extent, peace in North Africa is indivisible." He also said that he "deeply feels that now is the appropriate time to recognize Algeria's demand for independence."
    Bourguiba believes that establishing voluntary ties with France is not only necessary for Algeria, but also equally necessary for France. He believes that France should send competent people to negotiate with Algeria.
    Bourguiba's talks with the French government in Paris have concluded. He said that during the talks, he had requested the French government to reduce its troop presence in certain parts of Tunisia. He believes that France has "full and friendly understanding" of Tunisia on economic, financial, and other issues directly related to Tunisia.

    突尼斯首相强调北非和平不可分割
    希望法国同阿尔及利亚谈判
    新华社11日讯　巴黎消息：突尼斯首相布尔吉巴10日在谈到阿尔及利亚问题的时候说：“我并没有对法国领袖隐讳突尼斯对阿尔及利亚局势关切的程度，因为突尼斯认为，在一定程度上，北非的和平是不可分割的。”他还说，他“深切地感到现在正是承认阿尔及利亚独立要求的适当时机”。
    布尔吉巴认为，同法国建立出于自愿的联系不但对阿尔及利亚是必需的，而且对法国也同样是必需的。他认为，法国应该派出胜任的人去同阿尔及利亚谈判。
    布尔吉巴在巴黎同法国政府的会谈已经结束。他说，在会谈期间，他曾经要求法国政府减少在突尼斯某些地方的驻军。他认为，法国在同突尼斯直接有关的经济、财政和其他问题上，对突尼斯“有充分和友好的了解”。
