Several Anecdotes About Pu Songling
Wang Tongzhao

Three, The Discovery of "Southern Travel Drafts"

To discuss "Southern Travel Drafts," one must first mention Pu Songling's collection of posthumous poems. It is said that Pu wrote about 1,200 poems throughout his life. Whether he had a final, revised manuscript during his lifetime is unknown. Currently, over 800 poems have been collected and categorized from various sources. Unless new versions emerge, further investigation is impossible for the time being. The "Southern Travel Drafts" were collected by Mr. Wang Zhongheng in Jinan. The poems within are not entirely new and unseen, but rather some of Pu's earliest works. They were written when he served as a secretary in Baoying and Gaoyou counties, Jiangsu Province (Gaoyou was then a prefecture). Hence, they are named "Southern Travel." Moreover, the manuscript appears to be from a later period. While most poems are the same as those in his complete draft (that can be transcribed today), some are not found in the complete manuscript. From this perspective, this manuscript has its own value for reference and supplementation.

Pu Songling's southern tour was under the employment of Sun Shubai (name Hui), a fellow county resident and a *jinshi* (successful candidate in the imperial examinations) at a young age. He initially served as the magistrate of Baoying County and later was transferred to act as the prefect of Gaoyou Prefecture, around 1669-1672 (years 8 to 11 of the Kangxi reign). Sun Hui hired Pu Songling as a secretarial clerk, mainly to write official correspondence (he went in 1670 and returned home in 1671). Sun Hui himself seemed to have a fondness for literature, as seen in Pu's poems, which reflect their friendship. Here is a poem he wrote for Sun Hui in the Gaoyou office:

	Drifting like a seagull, light and free,
	The green pond resists my artistry.
	Illness and plum blossoms waste my frame,
	Willows and orioles evoke a mournful name.
	Only white hair shows no injustice,
	I fear even the east wind is worldly-wise.
	I am wasted, you are burdened,
	Our paths both drift under shifting skies.

His southern tour lasted just over a year, after which he did not travel far again. At the age of thirty-three (Kangxi 11th year), he taught at the home of Bi Jiyou, a fellow county resident. The Bi family had rich gardens and pavilions, such as the Shiyin Garden and the Chorantang, with a large collection of books. Pu Songling naturally had time for extensive reading. It can be said that the majority of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" was written during his early years teaching at the Bi family. He spent the latter half of his life, more than thirty years, in the Bi family's study until he was seventy-one, when he stopped teaching and returned to his hometown.

Four, Discovery of Relics Related to Pu Songling

Since the Shandong Provincial Cultural Bureau renovated Pu's former residence in 1953, efforts have been made to find his undiscovered works or items related to him from various sources. Apart from the portrait mentioned above, nothing had been found due to the passage of time. However, last year and this year, four relics related to him were found. One is the wooden plaque of "Chorantang" in the Bi family garden, mentioned in the "Flower Goddess" chapter of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," which was his former place of tutoring at the Bi's. This plaque was found and purchased from the descendants of the Bi family. Although old, it is the original item. Another is a stone inkstone he used for writing, collected by his ninth-generation descendant, named Wenhong, which has now been donated. Another item is an old-fashioned carved wooden bed found this summer, said to be the one Pu Songling slept on while teaching at the Bi family. There is also a "Drunken Awakening Stone," said to be held by Pu when he was drunk. All are now displayed in his former residence.

Five, Manuscript of a Long Poem Presented to Zhang Lianyuan

Coincidentally, after more than two hundred years of changes and amidst the chaos of war, this "Ancient Style" poem handwritten by Pu Songling in Jinan in 1702 (Kangxi 41st year, when Pu was sixty-three years old) and presented to Zhang Lianyuan is still intact. It was donated to the Shandong Cultural Relics Management Committee (now in the Shandong Museum) by Zhang Lianyuan's descendant, Mr. Zhang Gongzhi, the current Deputy Mayor of Qingdao (eighty years old). Zhang Lianyuan was three years older than Pu and was also a famous scholar in the early Qing Dynasty from Anqiu, Shandong. He was skilled in calligraphy and painting and traveled extensively. In their later years, they became friends by the side of Daming Lake through the introduction of Zhu Ziqing. Pu Songling probably did not bring his seal when he finished this poem, so he only signed his name and gave it to Zhang Lianyuan. The Zhang family mounted this calligraphy in the middle of a book of paintings and calligraphy. It has been kept in a box and moved around all these years, yet it was not lost. Mr. Zhang Gongzhi's donation allows us to have a clearer understanding of Pu Songling's handwriting. This is the only surviving handwritten poem by him. When Pu's collection of poems, essays, and folk songs is published in the future, it should be printed for wider circulation.

    有关蒲松龄的几则琐谈
    王统照
    三、“南游草”的发现
    要叙“南游草”不能不先说蒲松龄的遗诗集。据说蒲氏生平作了约一千二百多首诗，究竟在他生前有一清订稿本与否殊不可知。现从各方面搜集得到，加以分别录出的已有八百余首，其他除非新有别本出现，一时无从查考。“南游草”在济南经王仲衡老先生收存，其中的诗作却非全是前所未见的新本，只是蒲氏全诗中最早期的若干首。以他在江苏省的宝应和高邮县任上（那时高邮是知州缺）作幕时的所作，故以“南游”名之，而且钞本的时期似乎较晚，其中诗作大多数与他的全诗稿（今能钞得的）一样，可也有若干首是全钞本所未有的。从这点上说，这个钞本自有它的参考、补录的价值。
    蒲松龄的南游，他的东家是孙树百（名蕙），同县人，少年进士，初任宝应知县，后又调署高邮州，时在1669—1672年（清康熙8年到11年）。孙蕙聘蒲松龄去任书启师爷，主要是写作些应酬函牍（他于1670去1671回乡）。可是孙蕙本人对文词似颇爱好，从蒲氏的诗作中可以看出他们的朋友交谊。下面钞一首他在高邮署中写给孙蕙的诗：
    一身浪迹海鸥轻，青草池塘画不成。卧病梅花销瘦骨，断肠柳色忆啼莺。但除白发无公道，只恐东风亦世情。我自蹉跎君自苦，两人踪迹总飘零。他的南游一共不过一年多，回里以后没再远去。他于三十三岁（康熙十一年）在其同县毕际有家教书，毕家富有园亭，如石隐园、绰然堂等，藏书颇多，蒲松龄自然有广搜博览的时日，“聊斋志异”可说大半是在毕家处馆的前期写的。他的后半辈三十多年也是在毕家书斋中度过的，直至七十一岁才不教书，回到故乡。
    四、与蒲松龄有关的遗物的发现
    自1953年山东省文化局整修蒲氏故居以来，从各方面努力寻求他的未曾发现过的遗著或与他有关物品。除画像已如上述外，由于年岁久远，并没发现出什么东西。但去年、今年却找到了四件与他有关的遗物。一即当年他在毕家处馆时，曾于“聊斋志异”的“花神”一篇中提到的，毕家花园里“绰然堂”的木匾，这块匾从毕氏后人家找到买来，虽然陈旧，却是原物。一方他著书用过的石砚，归他的九世孙名文洪的收藏，今已献出。另一件是今年夏天找到的一个旧式雕花木床，传说是蒲松龄曾在毕家馆中睡过的。还有一块“醉醒石”，说是蒲氏酒醉时常常握过的。现在都陈列于其故居中。
    五、赠张?园的长诗手迹
    说也巧，同样经二百多年的变动，兵火抢攘中，这张蒲松龄于1702年（康熙41年）在济南（蒲氏时六十三岁）手书赠与张?园的一首“古风”竟尚完好，且经张氏后人，现在的青岛市副市长张公制老先生（八十岁）捐赠给山东文管会（今存山东博物馆内）。张?园年纪比蒲氏大三岁，山东安丘人，在清初也是位名士，擅长书画，游历的地方颇多。他们晚年在大明湖畔由于朱子青的介绍成了朋友。蒲松龄写成此诗，大约没带印章，只是署上名字送与张?园。张家把这张字裱在一本书画册页中间，这些年放在一个箱子里，到处流转，竟未损失。张公制先生捐献此页，使我们对于蒲松龄的字迹有更清楚的认识，而他手书的诗稿，也只有这一纸存留于世。他日蒲氏诗、文、俚曲集刊行，应当印入以广流传。
