    Thoughts on Climbing Yuhuatai
    Gōng Mù
    Here our ancestors once dreamed of flowers raining from the sky,
    Five colors fluttering,
    Just like rainbows and rosy clouds.
    Although this was just a vision of miraculous Buddhist dharma,
    It foreshadowed that the light of truth would eventually shine upon the world.
    But when the motherland was trapped in an era as dark as midnight,
    The rulers were a small gang of traitors, spies, thugs, and foreign lackeys—
    妄想想 Attempting to blockade history with bunkers,
    To suffocate the future with prisons,
    The executioner's blade gleaming,
    Yuhuatai became a Blood Flower Terrace.
    We had a hundred thousand comrades who sacrificed their lives here,
    Facing the enemy's guns, they raised their heads and looked up at the sky,
    Their gaze soared far beyond the blue-lettered, white-background yamen,
    Their final cries shook the heavens with a metallic clang.
    As they fell, the earth trembled and sighed deeply,
    The stars in the sky turned pale, tears falling like rain,
    Time convulsed for a moment, then flowed on like a surging river,
    The night was heavy, only cold frost and withered leaves covered their corpses.
    Thirty years! Sowing with heads, irrigating with blood,
    Every grain of sand was dyed with a dazzling light;
    Red flowers, magnificent and radiant, like the rising sun leaping out of the East Sea,
    Finally blooming luxuriantly in the hearts of six hundred million people.
    The executioners will forever be drowned in hatred, buried under curses,
    The executioner's blade has long rusted, the bunkers and prisons have long turned to moss;
    While on Yuhuatai stands a monument inscribed by Mao Zedong himself,
    A red cloud hangs in the sky, surrounded by evergreen pines and cypresses.
    Who says these colorful flower stones flew down from heaven?
    They are clearly shimmering with the light of the martyrs' red blood.
    Don't say that Buddhist dharma is boundless, that heaven will never age, and the earth is hard to turn barren;
    Relying entirely on us to guide the way to bring paradise to earth!

       ——September 13, 1956, Nanjing.
    Yuhuatai is located two li outside Zhonghua Gate in Nanjing, with colorful stones on the mountain. According to legend, during the Liang Dynasty, there was a monk named Dharma Master Yunguang who lectured on scriptures on the summit of this mountain, and flowers fell from the sky like rain, hence the name. After Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution in 1927 and entrenched himself in Nanjing, he used Yuhuatai as an execution ground. More than 100,000 communists and patriotic people were killed here successively, including comrades Yun Daiying and Deng Zhongxia, who were executed here.

    After liberation, the People's Government accepted the suggestions of the broad masses of the people and established the People's Revolutionary Martyrs' Cemetery here. A tall monument stands in front of the tomb, with the words "Long Live the Martyred Heroes!" inscribed on the front, in the handwriting of Chairman Mao.

    登雨花台有感
    公木在这里我们的祖先曾经梦见天雨花，五色缤纷飘荡荡就好像彩虹与飞霞。这虽然只不过是幻想出来显圣的佛法，它却预示着真理的灵光终将普照天下。而当祖国陷在子夜一般浓黑的时代，统治者是一小撮叛徒、特务、流氓、洋崽——妄想以碉堡封锁历史，以监牢窒息未来，屠刀光闪闪，雨花台变成了血花台。我们有十万同志在这里献出了生命，面对敌人的枪口，他们昂着头仰望长空，那视线高高超过蓝底白字的衙门，他们最后的呼声震得青天铮铮应鸣。他们倒下去，大地颤抖着闷声叹息，天上的群星脸色煞白，涕泣零如雨，时间痉挛一下又江水般滚滚流去，黑夜沉沉，尸身上只有冷霜枯叶来复蔽。三十年啊！以头颅播种，以鲜血灌溉，每一粒石子都被染上耀眼的光采；红花瑰丽绚烂如同朝阳跃出东海，终于在六万万人民的心里盎然盛开。刽子手将永远被仇恨淹没，被诅咒掩埋，屠刀早已生锈，碉堡和监牢早已化青苔；而雨花台竖起了毛泽东亲题的纪念碑，当空悬一朵红云，四周是长青的松柏。谁说这些五彩花石是飞来自天上？它们分明在闪烁着烈士赤血的光芒。莫道佛法无边，天原不老，地也难荒；把天堂引渡到人间，全靠我们领航！
       ——1956年9月13日南京。
    雨花台在南京中华门外二里，山上多彩石。相传梁朝时代，有个和尚叫云光法师，在此山巅讲经，天上落花如雨，因以得名。1927年蒋介石背叛革命后，盘踞南京，把雨花台做为刑场，有十万多共产党人与爱国志士先后在此被害，恽代英、邓中夏等同志都是在这里就义的。
    解放以后，人民政府接受广大群众的建议，在此建立了人民革命烈士墓，墓前高树丰碑，正面大书：“死难烈士万岁！”，系毛主席亲笔。
            ——1956年9月23日追记于杭州
