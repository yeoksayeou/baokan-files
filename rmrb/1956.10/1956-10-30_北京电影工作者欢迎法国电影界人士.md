Xinhua News Agency, 29th: More than 800 film workers in Beijing gathered this evening to welcome Mr. Georges Sadoul, Director of the Film Committee of the France-China Friendship Association, a renowned French film historian and critic, and his wife, as well as Mr. Jean Painlevé, Director of the French Scientific Education Film Institute and a famous scientific education film director, who are visiting China at the invitation.

    Wang Yang, representative of the preparatory committee of the China Film Workers Association and director of the Beijing Film Studio, delivered a welcoming speech. He said that our guests are outstanding figures in the French film industry, scholars and creators who are working diligently for the development of French and world cinema. Mr. Sadoul has been studying film art for twenty years, and his academic masterpiece "General History of Cinema," part of which has been published and part of which is yet to be completed, will have a significant impact on the film industry. Wang Yang also paid tribute to Mrs. Sadoul for helping Mr. Sadoul with his writing. Wang Yang then said that Mr. Painlevé is the creator of many excellent French scientific films and is also a doctor of medicine. He has made great contributions to the French and world scientific film industries. Wang Yang concluded by saying that we have done very little research on the history of film and scientific films. We are particularly pleased to have our French friends visit, as this is an excellent opportunity to learn from them in person.

    Sadoul and Painlevé also spoke at the meeting, expressing their gratitude for the friendship of their Chinese film colleagues. They both praised the achievements of the New China's film industry, believing that the excellent films produced in China are fully comparable to internationally renowned films. Finally, they wished the Chinese film industry even greater achievements.

    The guests and hosts watched the documentary film "The Life of Lu Xun" and the color feature film "The New Year's Sacrifice."

    Among those attending tonight's welcoming party were Wang Lanxi, Assistant Minister of Culture and Director of the Film Bureau; Cai Chusheng, Tian Fang, Situ Huimin, and Gao Ge, Deputy Directors of the Film Bureau; and heads of various film studios, film directors, and actors Yuan Wenshu, Ya Ma, Qian Xiaozhang, Hong Lin, Cheng Yin, Sang Hu, and Lan Ma, among others.

    Sadoul and Painlevé will give academic reports to Beijing film professionals on the 30th and 31st, respectively.
