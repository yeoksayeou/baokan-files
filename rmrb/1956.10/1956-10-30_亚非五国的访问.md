    Visit to Five Asian and African Countries
    By Bao Erhan, Head of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation
    (I) The Delegation's Noble Mission
    In order to implement the resolutions of the Bandung Conference on strengthening cultural cooperation between Asian and African countries and promoting cultural exchanges among them, the People's Republic of China dispatched a cultural and art delegation to the Middle East and Africa in February 1956 for friendly visits and performances. We visited the Republic of Egypt, the Republic of Sudan, the Kingdom of Ethiopia, the Republic of Syria, and the Republic of Lebanon for over four months. During the visit, we received warm receptions and welcomes from the governments and people of these countries. The heads of state and other leaders of the aforementioned five countries met with the leaders of the delegation one after another and expressed the friendly intentions of their governments and people towards the Chinese government and people.
    During its visit abroad, the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation gave a total of fifty-four performances, with an audience of more than 76,000 people. Our artistic performances, our songs and dances, deeply touched the hearts of the people of these five countries. They praised our beautiful national art, especially our Peking Opera, for which they had a very high regard. Egyptian President Nasser said to me after watching the art troupe's performance: "I admire the way Chinese art maintains its beautiful national style and rich oriental colors."
    While performing in these countries, we also learned the excellent national arts of the people of these countries. We learned their songs and dances and performed these newly learned songs and dances in many performances. The exchange of experiences and mutual learning between Chinese artists and the artists of these countries not only enhanced the friendship between the people of all countries, but also specifically achieved the purpose of cultural exchange, which helped to enrich the cultural and artistic life of the people of all countries. I think this is very meaningful work.
    During the delegation's visit, we had extensive friendly contacts with prominent figures in the cultural and artistic circles, education circles, religious circles, and political circles of various countries. This contact further deepened the mutual understanding and friendship between our country and the people of these countries.
    During the delegation's visit, we also held talks with government representatives of some countries on cultural cooperation on behalf of our government. After full and friendly discussions, cultural cooperation agreements were signed between China and Egypt, and between China and Syria. In Sudan and Ethiopia, we exchanged letters with the governments of these two countries, expressing a common desire to develop cultural cooperation. In Beirut, we exchanged preliminary views in detail with representatives appointed by the Lebanese government on issues related to cultural cooperation between China and Lebanon.
    During the delegation's visit, we saw the beautiful landscapes, ancient and rich cultures, and hardworking, brave, simple, and hospitable people of these five countries. We also visited the historical sites, factories, and schools of these countries.
    (II) Three General Impressions
    After visiting these five countries, I have the following general impressions:
    My first impression is that the resolutions of the Bandung Conference and the Bandung spirit have deeply penetrated the hearts of the people of Asian and African countries and have become an irresistible trend. Whether it was government leaders or ordinary officials, or ordinary people, that we encountered in the five Asian and African countries, they were still enthusiastically talking about the Bandung Conference and its historically significant achievements more than a year after the Bandung Conference concluded. I found that the resolutions of the Bandung Conference and the Bandung spirit have become the common language between the governments and people of Asian and African countries and the solid foundation for the unity and cooperation of the Asian and African people.
    My second impression is that after World War II, especially in recent years, the Asian and African people are experiencing a great historical period of national awakening. The five Asian and African countries we visited, although to varying degrees, are all moving towards independent development. All of these countries have gained independence after a long period of anti-colonialist struggle. The people of these countries are working hard to get rid of the economic and cultural backwardness left over by Western colonialism. They demand to have complete control over the fate of their own nation.
    My third impression is that "Friendship with the Chinese people!" has become the unanimous call of the people of Asian and African countries. The people of Asian and African countries attach importance to the historic victory of the Chinese people in their struggle for complete national independence and are keenly concerned about every great achievement of the Chinese people in building their own country. In the countries we visited, we could hear people saying everywhere: "We are Orientals, we are brothers"; and we could also hear people saying everywhere: "We and you have both suffered from the enslavement and oppression of colonialists, we and you have had common suffering; but we and you will have common joy." Although the imperialists have tried to spread vicious slanders and smears against the Chinese people among the people of these countries, the market for imperialist lies is shrinking in these countries. Our peaceful foreign policy has already had an increasingly significant impact even in countries thousands of miles away from our country. The continuous development of friendly relations between China and Asian and African countries cannot be stopped by any force.
    Below, I would like to briefly introduce what we saw and heard in the five countries we visited.
    (III) In the Land of the Pyramids
    From February 25th to April 16th, we visited the Republic of Egypt. As everyone knows, Egypt is an ancient civilized country with a history of nearly six thousand years. We walked at the foot of the Pyramid of King Cheops and the Sphinx, one of the Seven Wonders of the World. The pyramid is indeed a masterpiece in the history of human architecture. From the pyramid, we saw the brutal rule of the ancient Egyptian emperors; at the same time, we saw the diligence, wisdom, and great power of the Egyptian people.
    Egypt is not only an ancient cultural country, but also a very beautiful country. This is because Egypt has a Nile River to be proud of. The Nile River, which is 6,500 kilometers long, has more than 1,000 kilometers of river water flowing through the territory of Egypt. The banks of the Nile River are beautiful and green all year round. However, there is almost no rain in Egypt, and it never rains in some places. In southern Egypt, even elderly people in their seventies and eighties have never seen raindrops. Therefore, farmland irrigation depends entirely on this continuous flowing Nile River. More than 90% of Egypt's land is uninhabited desert, and only the banks of the Nile River extend into green fields. Outside the fields, you can see the vast and boundless desert. Therefore, in the past, people called Egypt a gift given by the Nile River. But in my opinion, Egypt is not a "gift" from the Nile River, because every inch of land in Egypt has been seized from the desert by the Egyptian people. To this day, the Egyptian people are still engaged in the great struggle to conquer the desert. People see the deserts and fertile fields of Egypt, and they cannot help but feel awe for the hardworking and brave Egyptian people.
    We visited Egypt's famous "Liberation Province." This is a new province built in the desert. Egyptian workers used bulldozers and excavators to remove piles of yellow sand from this barren desert, diverted a canal from afar, and dug many artesian wells. In this way, a new piece of land appeared in the desert. From September 1953 to the end of this year, 14,000 feddans (each feddan is equal to 6.3 Chinese mu) of land will be opened up. It is expected that 1.2 million feddans of new land will be opened up in the "Liberation Province" within fifteen years. Eighty-two Egyptian professors, scientists, and more than 10,000 workers are engaged in the "Liberation Province" project. I think the experience of Egypt in building the "Liberation Province" is worth learning from. Due to natural conditions, the Egyptian people have accumulated rich experience in desert farming, and this experience is very useful for the construction work in our country's desert areas. We also visited the Aswan Dam. We saw that a small hydroelectric power station is under construction next to the old Aswan Dam. In addition, the Egyptian government plans to build the Aswan High Dam six kilometers south of the old dam. The Egyptians call it "Sadd el-Ali." The completion of this high dam will be able to store 165.5 billion cubic meters of water and irrigate 2 million feddans of land. At the same time, a huge hydroelectric power station with a new annual power generation capacity of 10 billion kilowatt-hours will be built near "Sadd el-Ali."
    Whether in the "Liberation Province" or at the Aswan Dam, the Egyptian friends we met were all people full of confidence and determination in their country's construction cause. As Mr. Hasani, the governor of the Liberation Province, said to me: "Some people in Western countries despise us, saying that we are uncivilized and backward countries, and that we have no ability to manage our own country. However, we are not born backward. Once we are free, our people will create miracles and we will become an advanced country."
    I am sure and wish the Egyptian people to achieve achievements like the pyramids in the cause of building their motherland. The Chinese people are very happy to have friends like the Egyptian people on the African continent. The Chinese people are sincerely concerned about the Egyptian people's struggle to safeguard national independence and state sovereignty, and are concerned about the achievements of the Egyptian people in building their new life. And the Egyptian people will always be good friends of the Chinese people. Here, I would like to quote what Mr. Radwan, the Minister of National Guidance of Egypt, said at the farewell banquet of our delegation in Egypt. He said: "The Egyptian people admire the struggle of the Chinese people. In the struggle for world peace, the Egyptian people stand wholeheartedly with the Chinese people. Peace is the basis that connects the Egyptian people and the Chinese people. Let us work together to build a better future and to defend world peace!" Yes, let us work together with the Egyptian people, with the people of the world, to build a better future and to defend world peace!
   (IV) Days in Khartoum
    From April 16th to April 27th, we visited Khartoum, the capital of the Republic of Sudan. Khartoum is located on the upper reaches of the Nile River and has a population of 80,000. Together with Omdurman, the old capital of Sudan across the Nile River, and a town north of Khartoum, it has a population of nearly 400,000. These three places have actually become one city.
    When we arrived in Khartoum, we felt the heat of the climate. The temperature at that time had reached over 100 degrees Fahrenheit; but according to our Sudanese friends, we were still very lucky and the weather this year was relatively "cool."
    Since Sudan had just become independent, the colonialists did not even leave a theater in Khartoum. Therefore, the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation could only temporarily set up a stage for performances in an open-air club. In fact, this was a very ideal theater. There were no walls around, but rather lush trees. At night, the cool breeze passed through the trees and blew into the theater, making the audience very comfortable to watch the Chinese art performances. April 18th happened to be the first anniversary of the Bandung Conference, and the delegation held an opening ceremony for the performance in Khartoum. This was of profound significance. The Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Sudan, Mr. Si El Khatim, and the then Acting Prime Minister Ibrahim El Mufti, both attended the opening ceremony of our performance. It can be said that the opening ceremony of our performance in Sudan was actually a commemoration meeting to celebrate the first anniversary of the Bandung Conference. At the opening ceremony, the Acting Prime Minister of the Republic of Sudan, Mr. Mufti, said in his speech: "The Bandung Conference is a turning point in international relations and relations between people of all countries. If the principles of the Bandung Conference can be realized in all countries, then world peace can be guaranteed." There is no doubt that we completely agree with Mr. Mufti's opinion.
    The performance of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation became the focus of people's discussions in Khartoum. Every night, the open-air theater was not only full, but also full of standing spectators, and there was not even space to squeeze into the theater. On the street outside the theater, there were also crowds of people who were enjoying the Chinese art performances through the trees. The crowd outside the theater and the audience inside the theater cheered and applauded together. Every night at the end of the performance, many Sudanese people waited at the entrance of the theater to see off our Chinese artists. They sometimes shouted in Chinese:
  "Long live peace!" The Sudanese people's friendly enthusiasm for the Chinese people could not but move people.
    In Sudan, we toured the city of Khartoum. In Khartoum, there are still two disgusting bronze statues: one is a bronze statue of Kitchener, a British general who opened up the African colony in the 19th century; the other is a bronze statue of Gordon, a British man who ran from Asia to Africa in the 1880s to carry out colonial conspiracies. These two bronze statues of course easily reminded the Sudanese people of the bloody rule of colonialism they suffered. As a Chinese person, when I saw the bronze statue of this colonialist Gordon, I easily thought of the past suffering of the Chinese people. As everyone knows, this Gordon, who went to Sudan in the 1880s to enslave the Sudanese people, was the same Gordon who helped the Qing Dynasty suppress the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom peasant uprising in the 1860s.
    Just like the Chinese people, the Sudanese people are brave people. In the old capital of Omdurman, along the Nile River, we saw a long line of earth fortresses. This is where the Sudanese people bravely rose up to fight back when British General Kitchener led his troops to invade Khartoum in 1898. At that time, the Sudanese people showed extraordinary heroism. Later, although the British colonialists occupied Sudan, the Sudanese people never gave in. They carried out a long-term anti-colonialist struggle for more than half a century, and finally forced the British colonialists to retreat and build an independent Republic of Sudan. Now the Sudanese people are maintaining a high degree of vigilance against the imperialists' aggressive conspiracies in Africa, and they are holding high the banner of safeguarding peace and national independence.
    On April 28th, we bid farewell to Khartoum with fond memories of this country.
    (V) In the Capital of "New Flower"
    From April 28th to May 14th, we visited Addis Ababa, the capital of the Kingdom of Ethiopia. "Addis Ababa" means "New Flower" in Amharic. Originally, before Ethiopia established its capital in Addis Ababa seventy-three years ago, there were beautiful wildflowers of colorful colors all over the mountains. Later, Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II toured here and was attracted by its beauty, so he decided to establish his capital here and named it
  "New Flower".
    In Ethiopia, our art troupe achieved great success. Chinese art performances set off a huge climax in the cultural life of the residents of Addis Ababa. Every day, crowds of people crowded in front of the gate of the Haile Selassie I Theatre, even breaking the two large glass panels of the main entrance. Ethiopian newspapers commented: "Chinese art performances have caused a sensation in Addis Ababa," which shows the Ethiopian people's love for Chinese art.
    In the past, few Chinese people had set foot in Ethiopia. There were only four overseas Chinese in Addis Ababa. Therefore, the Ethiopian people did not know much about China. However, this visit by the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation left a deep impression in the hearts of the Ethiopian people. They learned more about China through our art performances. Based on our experience of contact and communication, the Ethiopian people also have friendly feelings towards the Chinese people.
    Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I met with our delegation. Emperor Selassie told me that he was very grateful to our Premier Zhou Enlai for expressing good intentions to the Ethiopian people through the Kingdom's representative at the Bandung Conference. Emperor Selassie also hoped that mutual visits between individuals and delegations between China and Ethiopia could increase in the future.
    On May 7th, we participated in the celebration of the fifteenth anniversary of Ethiopia's liberation from the Italian fascist aggressors. Everyone can remember that in October 1935, Italian fascist aggressor troops invaded the territory of Ethiopia, and the Ethiopian people rose up to resist the aggressors. Although the Italian aggressor troops had modern weapons, and the Ethiopian people only had simple weapons, the war of resistance lasted for more than half a year, until May 1936, when the aggressor troops finally occupied Addis Ababa using barbaric means of releasing poison gas. In 1941, the German fascist troops collapsed in Africa, and Emperor Haile Selassie returned to Addis Ababa. At the celebration ceremony on "Liberation Day", we saw the Ethiopian Royal Cavalry and infantry marching through Liberation Square, and several Ethiopian planes flew over the sky. We Chinese people have always admired the heroism shown by the Ethiopian people in the war of resistance against Italy; and as Emperor Haile Selassie said, when Ethiopia was in those dark days, the Chinese people gave the Ethiopian people sympathy and support. I believe that the friendship between the people of China and Ethiopia will also be fully developed.
      (VI) In Syria
    From May 14th to 21st, the delegation rested in Cairo for a week. From May 21st to June 12th, we visited the Republic of Syria. The delegation was invited to visit by President Kuwatly of the Republic of Syria. President Kuwatly watched the delegation's performance in Alexandria, Egypt, praised Chinese art, and extended an invitation.
    After we arrived in Damascus, the capital of the Republic of Syria, we immediately paid a visit to President Kuwatly. During the meeting, the President wished the delegation a successful performance and said: "I believe that when you leave this country, you will take away the hearts of the Syrian people." Sure enough, we received a warm welcome from the Syrian people in Syria. We were welcomed by Syrian university students during the performance, we were also welcomed by officers and soldiers of the Syrian Defense Forces, and we were welcomed by the citizens of Damascus. When our delegation arrived in Aleppo, an important town in northern Syria, more than 200 workers, farmers, students, and artists from Aleppo went out to the suburbs 10 kilometers away to greet our delegation, and two beautiful Syrian girls presented us with flowers. Two Syrians stood on a large car, holding the Syrian flag high, and welcomed us to the place where we rested in the city. Along the way, we were warmly welcomed by the citizens of Aleppo, who cheered to us: "Long live the friendship between the Arab people and the Chinese people!" "Long live Sino-Syrian friendship!" "Long live peace!" We stayed in Syria for a total of twenty-three days. On June 12th, our delegation left this hospitable country with the Syrian people's love for peace and a heart full of friendship for the Chinese people.
    (VII) In the Garden of Asia
    From June 12th to June 28th, we spent those unforgettable days in Beirut, the capital of the last country on our visit itinerary - the Republic of Lebanon. Beirut is a very beautiful city, close to the Mediterranean coast, with picturesque scenery and is known as the "Garden of Asia". Throughout the year, tens of thousands of travelers from all over the world come to visit this beautiful city. There are many swimming pools on the seaside, and many men and women swim and engage in water skiing from early morning until evening.
    During its visit to Beirut, the delegation received a warm welcome from people from all walks of life. I would like to especially mention the welcome tea party held by the Lebanese Peace Committee for the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation. Among those who attended the tea party were the Chairman of the Lebanese Peace Committee and Chairman of the Lebanese Engineers Association, Antoine Tabet, the head of the Lebanese delegation to the Bandung Conference and former Prime Minister Sami Solh, as well as former Prime Minister Hussein Oweini, the Chairman of the Lebanese Legal Workers Association, Farid Kuzma, and more than 300 prominent figures from all walks of life in Lebanon. The tea party proceeded in a very warm and friendly atmosphere. Mr. George Hanna, a famous Lebanese writer, said in his speech at the meeting: "In the past, imperialism tried to divide our unity. But now, you have gone to Bandung; and we have also gone to Bandung. We and you have found the road to unity, we and you have shaken hands with each other, and we and you deeply realize that the unity and cooperation between Asian and African countries is indivisible. You are our true friends." I think, through these words of this Lebanese writer, I don't need to explain the Lebanese people's friendly feelings towards the Chinese people.
    I would like to especially emphasize the great significance of strengthening cultural exchanges and economic cooperation between countries in the world. When we visited Asian and African countries, we realized that the people of all countries not only want to improve their material lives, but also love culture and art. People need culture and art, and they do not need war. The people of all countries demand a common rise in cultural and economic life on the basis of international cultural and economic exchanges. Therefore, further strengthening international cultural and economic exchanges will enable the cause of the entire human race to strive for lasting peace to be victorious.
    The reason why our Cultural and Art Delegation was able to successfully complete its visit and performance mission this time is the result of the efforts of all members of the delegation, especially the result of the enthusiastic provision of many conveniences and assistance by the governments and people of the five countries of Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Syria, and Lebanon. On behalf of all our staff, I would like to express our most heartfelt gratitude to the governments and people of these hospitable countries. (Attached picture)

    亚非五国的访问
    中华人民共和国文化艺术代表团团长  包尔汉
    （一）代表团的崇高任务
    为了贯彻万隆会议关于加强亚非国家文化合作和促进亚非各国文化交流的决议，1956年2月中华人民共和国派出了一个文化艺术代表团到中东和非洲各国去进行友好的访问和演出。我们访问了埃及共和国、苏丹共和国、埃塞俄比亚王国、叙利亚共和国同黎巴嫩共和国五个国家，历时四个多月。在访问期间，我们受到了这些国家的政府和人民的热情的接待和欢迎，上述五个国家的元首及其他领导人都先后接见了代表团的领导人员，并且向我们表示了他们的政府和人民对中国政府和人民的友好的意愿。
    中国文化艺术代表团在这次出国访问期间，共演出了五十四场，观众达七万六千多人。我国的艺术表演，我们的歌曲和舞蹈深深地打动了这五个国家人民的心灵，他们称赞我们优美的民族艺术，特别是对于我国的京剧有很高的评价。埃及总统纳赛尔在看了艺术团的演出以后对我说：“我很钦佩中国的艺术保持着优美的民族风格和丰富的东方色彩。”
    我们在这些国家演出的同时，还学习了这些国家人民的优秀的民族艺术。我们学会了他们的歌和他们的舞，并且在许多次的演出中表演了这些新学会的歌舞节目。我国艺术家和这些国家的艺术家之间的交流经验和相互学习，不仅增进了各国人民之间的友谊，而且具体地达到了文化交流的目的，有助于丰富各国人民的文化艺术生活。我认为这是非常有意义的工作。
    在代表团访问期间，我们同各国的文化艺术界、教育界、宗教界及政治界的著名人士进行了广泛的友好接触。这种接触更进一步地加深了我国和这些国家人民之间的相互了解和友谊。
    在代表团访问期间，我们还奉我国政府之命同一些国家的政府代表举行了有关文化合作的会谈。经过充分的友好的讨论，签订了中国和埃及、中国和叙利亚的文化合作协定。在苏丹和埃塞俄比亚，我们同这两国的政府互换了信件，表示了发展文化合作的共同愿望。在贝鲁特，我们同黎巴嫩政府所指派的代表，就有关中黎两国文化合作的问题详尽地交换了初步的意见。
    在代表团访问期间，我们看到了这五个国家的美丽锦绣的山河，古老丰富的文化和勤劳、勇敢、纯朴、好客的人民。我们也参观了这些国家的名胜古迹、工厂和学校。
    （二）三点总的印象
    在访问了这五个国家以后，我深深地获有下面几个总的印象：
    我的第一个印象是：万隆会议的决议和万隆精神已经深入了亚非各国人民的心中，已经成为一股不可抗拒的潮流。我们在亚非五国所遇到的无论是政府领袖和一般官员，无论普通人民，他们在万隆会议闭幕一年多以后的今天，仍然热烈地谈论着万隆会议和它的具有历史意义的成就。我发现，万隆会议的决议和万隆精神已经成为亚非各国政府和人民间的共同语言和亚非人民团结合作的坚实的基础。
    我的第二个印象是：第二次世界大战以后，特别是近年以来，亚非人民正在经历着一个伟大的民族觉醒的历史时期。我们所访问的五个亚非国家，程度虽然有所不同，但都在走向独立发展的道路。所有这些国家都在经过了长期的反殖民主义的斗争以后，获得了独立的地位。这些国家的人民正在为摆脱西方殖民主义所遗留下来的经济和文化的落后状态而努力。他们要求把他们本民族的命运完完全全地掌握在自己的手里。
    我的第三个印象是：“和中国人民友好！”已经成为亚非各国人民的一致呼声。亚非各国人民重视中国人民在争取自己国家完全独立的斗争中所取得的历史性的胜利，热烈地关怀着中国人民在建设自己国家中的每一项巨大的成就。在我们访问的国家里，到处都能够听到那里的人们说：“我们是东方人，我们是兄弟”；也到处可以听到那里的人们说：“我们和你们都曾经遭受过殖民主义者的奴役和压迫，我们和你们有过共同的苦难；但我们和你们都将要有共同的欢乐。”虽然帝国主义者力图在这些国家人民中间散布毁谤和污蔑中国人民的恶毒的谰言，但是在这些国家，帝国主义的谎言的市场越来越缩小了。我国的和平外交政策甚至已经在距离我国万里之外的国度里产生了日益巨大的影响。中国和亚非各国间的友好关系的不断发展，是任何势力也阻挡不了的。
    下面我想扼要地介绍一下我们所访问的五个国家的见闻。
    （三）在金字塔的国度里
    2月25日至4月16日，我们访问了埃及共和国。大家都知道，埃及是一个有着将近六千年历史的文明古国。我们曾在世界七奇之一的齐阿普斯王的金字塔和狮身人面像的脚下走过。金字塔的确是人类建筑史上的一件巧夺天工的杰作。我们从金字塔看到了埃及古代帝王的残暴统治；同时又看到了埃及人民的勤劳、智慧和伟大的力量。
    埃及不仅是一个文化古老的国家，而且是一个非常美丽的国家。这是因为埃及有一条足以自豪的尼罗河。全长六千五百公里的尼罗河有一千多公里的河水流过埃及的国境。尼罗河两岸，风光明媚，四季常青。但是在埃及，几乎没有雨水，有些地方根本不下雨，在埃及的南方，甚至七、八十岁的老年人还没有见过雨点。因此，农田灌溉全靠这条畅流不息的尼罗河。埃及的百分之九十以上的国土是荒无人烟的沙漠，只有尼罗河两岸伸展着绿色的田野。田野外面就能望见广袤无垠的荒沙。所以过去人们称埃及是尼罗河所赐予的礼物。但是依我看来，埃及并非是尼罗河的“礼物”，因为埃及的每一寸土地都是由埃及人民向沙漠夺取过来的。直到今天，埃及人民还在进行着征服沙漠的伟大的斗争。人们看到了埃及的沙漠和良田，也就不禁会对勤劳勇敢的埃及人民肃然起敬。
    我们参观了埃及的著名的“解放省”。这是在沙漠上建设起来的一个新的省份。埃及的工人用开路机和挖泥机在这荒凉的沙漠上移去一堆一堆的黄沙，从远处引来了一条水渠，并且开凿了许多自流井。就这样，沙漠上出现了一片新土。从1953年9月到今年年底，将开凿出一万四千埃亩（每埃亩等于六点三华亩）的土地。预计在十五年内“解放省”将要开出一百二十万埃亩的新土地。埃及的八十二位教授、科学家和一万多名工人正在从事着“解放省”的事业。我认为埃及建设“解放省”的经验有许多是值得我们学习的。由于自然条件的关系，埃及人民累积了沙漠耕作的丰富的经验，这些经验对我国沙漠地区的建设工作是很有用处的。我们还参观了阿斯旺水坝。我们看到在阿斯旺旧水坝旁边，一座小型的水力发电站正在建设中。另外在旧水坝以南六公里的地方，埃及政府计划兴建阿斯旺高水坝。埃及人称为“沙德阿里。”这个高水坝的建成将能储水一千六百五十亿立方公尺，灌溉二百万埃亩的土地。同时一个新的一年能够发电一百亿?瓦时电力的巨大的水力发电站将在“沙德阿里”的附近建设起来。
    无论在“解放省”或是在阿斯旺水坝，我们所遇到的埃及朋友都是对自己国家的建设事业充满着自信和决心的人们。正如解放省省长哈萨尼先生对我说的：“西方国家的某些人轻视我们，说我们是未开化的落后国家，说我们没有能力管理自己的国家。可是，我们并不是天生落后的。一旦我们自由了，我们的人民将创造奇迹，我们会变成先进的国家。”
    我确信并且预祝埃及人民建设自己祖国的事业将要获得像金字塔一样的丰功伟绩。中国人民非常高兴在非洲大陆上有了像埃及人民那样的朋友。中国人民衷心地关怀着埃及人民为维护民族独立和国家主权的斗争，关怀着埃及人民在建设自己新生活的事业中的成就。而埃及人民也永远是中国人民的很好的朋友。这里我想引用埃及国家指导部部长拉德温先生在我们代表团的告别埃及的宴会上讲的话。他说：“埃及人民钦佩中国人民的斗争。在争取世界和平的斗争中，埃及人民全心全意地同中国人民站在一起。和平是把埃及人民和中国人民联系起来的基础，让我们一道为建设美好的将来，为保卫世界和平而斗争！”是的，让我们同埃及人民一道，同全世界人民一道，为建设美好的将来，为保卫世界和平而斗争吧！
   （四）在喀土穆的日子
    4月16日至4月27日我们访问了苏丹共和国的首都喀土穆。喀土穆位于尼罗河上游，人口有八万人，加上尼罗河对岸的苏丹旧都恩图曼和喀土穆北面的一个镇子，共有将近四十万人。这三个地方实际上已经成为一个城市。
    到了喀土穆就感到气候的炎热了。当时的温度已经达到了华氏一百度以上；但据苏丹的朋友们说，我们还算很幸运，今年的天气还比较“凉快”。
    由于苏丹刚刚独立不久，殖民主义者甚至没有在喀土穆留下一个剧场。因此，中国文化艺术代表团只能临时在一个露天的俱乐部搭台演出。其实，这倒是一个很理想的剧场。四周没有围墙，而是枝叶茂盛的树林。夜晚，清凉的风透过树林，吹进剧场，使观众们非常舒适地观看中国的艺术表演。4月18日，正巧是万隆会议一周年，代表团在喀土穆举行了演出开幕式。这是具有深刻的意义的。苏丹共和国最高委员会主席西·伊罗和当时的代理总理易卜拉欣·埃尔·穆弗蒂都出席了我们演出的开幕式。可以这样说，我们在苏丹演出的开幕式实际上就是一个庆祝万隆会议一周年的纪念大会。在开幕式上，苏丹共和国代理总理穆弗蒂致词说：“万隆会议是国际关系和各国人民间关系的转折点。如果万隆会议的原则能够在各国实现，那么世界和平就能够获得保障。”毫无疑问，我们完全同意穆弗蒂先生的这个意见的。
    中国文化艺术代表团的演出，在喀土穆成了人们谈论的中心。每天晚上露天剧场里不仅坐满了、而且站满了观众，甚至连挤进剧场的空间也没有了。在剧场外面的大街上还拥挤着人群，他们隔着树林欣赏中国的艺术表演。场外的群众和场内的观众一起欢呼和一起鼓掌。每天晚上演出结束时，许多苏丹人等在剧场门口欢送我国的艺术家们。他们有时用中国话高呼：
  “和平万岁！”苏丹人民对于中国人民友好的热情不能不使人感动。
    在苏丹，我们游览了喀土穆的市容。在喀土穆至今还树立着两座令人厌恶的铜像：一座是十九世纪开拓非洲殖民地的一个英国将军契金纳的铜像；另一座是上个世纪八十年代从亚洲跑到非洲去进行殖民阴谋的英国人戈登的铜像。这两座铜像当然很容易地使苏丹人回忆到他们所遭受的殖民主义血腥的统治。作为一个中国人，当我看到这个殖民主义者戈登铜像时，也就很容易地联想到了中国人民的苦难的过去。大家都知道，这个在上个世纪八十年代到苏丹去奴役苏丹人民的戈登，也就是在上个世纪六十年代帮助清朝镇压太平天国农民起义的同一个戈登。
    正和中国人民一样，苏丹人民是英勇的人民。我们在旧都恩图曼，沿着尼罗河，看到一长列的土堡垒。这是1898年当英国将军契金纳率领军队侵入喀土穆时，苏丹人英勇地起来反击的地方。当时苏丹人表现了非凡的英雄气概。以后，英国殖民者虽然占领了苏丹，但是苏丹人民从来都没有屈服过。他们进行了半个世纪以上的长期的反殖民主义斗争，终于迫使英国殖民者退让而建成了独立的苏丹共和国。现在苏丹人民正对帝国主义在非洲的侵略阴谋保持着高度的警惕，他们高举着维护和平和民族独立的大旗。
    4月28日，我们怀着对这个国家的亲切的记忆向喀土穆告别了。
    （五）在“新花”之都
    4月28日到5月14日，我们访问了埃塞俄比亚王国的首都亚的斯亚贝巴。“亚的斯亚贝巴”，阿姆哈拉语是“新花”的意思。原来是七十三年前在埃塞俄比亚奠都于亚的斯亚贝巴以前，这里曾是遍山遍野的彩色缤纷的美丽的野花。后来埃塞俄比亚皇帝麦涅力克二世巡游至此，为它的美丽所吸引，因而决定奠都于此，并命名为
  “新花”。
    在埃塞俄比亚，我国艺术团获得了很大的成功。中国的艺术表演在亚的斯亚贝巴居民的文化生活中掀起了一个巨大的高潮。每天，人群拥挤在海尔·赛拉西一世剧院的大门前，甚至把正门的两块大玻璃都挤碎了。埃塞俄比亚的报纸评论说：“中国的艺术表演轰动了亚的斯亚贝巴”，这就可见埃塞俄比亚人民对于中国艺术的热爱了。
    在埃塞俄比亚，过去很少有中国人的足迹。在亚的斯亚贝巴也只有四个华侨。因此，埃塞俄比亚人民对于中国的了解是不很多的。但是这次中国文化艺术代表团的访问在埃塞俄比亚人民的心中留下了深刻的印象。他们通过了我们的艺术表演，更多地了解了中国。根据我们的接触和交往的经验，埃塞俄比亚人民对于中国人民同样怀着友好的感情。
    埃塞俄比亚皇帝海尔·赛拉西一世接见了我们代表团。赛拉西皇帝对我说，他非常感谢我们周恩来总理在万隆会议上通过王国代表对埃塞俄比亚人民所表示的良好的意愿。赛拉西皇帝并希望今后中国同埃塞俄比亚之间的个人和代表团的互相访问能够增多起来。
    5月7日，我们参加了埃塞俄比亚从意大利法西斯侵略者的手中解放出来的十五周年纪念日的庆祝大典。大家都能够记得起来，1935年10月，意大利法西斯侵略军入侵埃塞俄比亚的国土，埃塞俄比亚人民奋起抗击侵略者。虽然意大利侵略军有近代化的武器，而埃塞俄比亚人民只有简陋的武器，可是抗战进行了半年以上，直到1936年5月，侵略军最后用施放毒气的野蛮手段才占领了亚的斯亚贝巴。1941年，德意志法西斯军队在非洲溃退，海尔·赛拉西皇帝重又回到了亚的斯亚贝巴。在“解放日”的庆祝典礼上，我们看到了埃塞俄比亚王家骑兵队和步兵走过解放广场，还有几架埃塞俄比亚的飞机掠过天空。对于埃塞俄比亚人民在抗意战争中所表现的英雄气概，我们中国人民是一向钦佩的；并且正如海尔·赛拉西皇帝所说，当埃塞俄比亚处在那些黑暗日子里的时候，中国人民曾给予埃塞俄比亚人民以同情和支持。我相信，中国和埃塞俄比亚两国人民之间的友谊也将会得到充分的发展。
      （六）在叙利亚
    5月14日至21日，代表团在开罗休息了一个星期。5月21日至6月12日，我们访问了叙利亚共和国。代表团是应叙利亚共和国库阿特利总统的邀请前去访问的。库阿特利总统早在埃及的亚历山大时就观看了代表团的演出，他称赞中国的艺术，并且提出了邀请。
    我们到了叙利亚共和国首都大马士革后立即拜会了库阿特利总统。总统在接见时预祝代表团演出的成功，并且说：“我相信，当你们离开这个国家时，会把叙利亚人民的心给带走的。”果然，我们在叙利亚受到了叙利亚人民的热烈的欢迎。我们在演出中受到了叙利亚的大学生的欢迎，我们也受到叙利亚国防部队的军官和士兵的欢迎，我们受到了大马士革的市民的欢迎。当我们代表团到达叙利亚北部的重镇阿勒颇去访问时，阿勒颇市的工人、农民、学生和艺术家等二百余人走出市郊十公里以外来迎接我们代表团，两个美丽的叙利亚女孩子向我们献花。有两个叙利亚人站在大汽车上高高地举着叙利亚的国旗，把我们迎入市区休息的地方。沿途，我们受到阿勒颇市民的热情的欢迎，他们向我们欢呼：“阿拉伯人民和中国人民友好万岁！”“中叙友谊万岁！”“和平万岁！”在叙利亚，我们一共逗留了二十三天。6月12日，我们代表团带着叙利亚人民热爱和平的心和充满对中国人民的友情的心离开了这个好客的国家。
    （七）在亚洲的花园
    6月12日至6月28日，我们在访问日程上最后的一个国家——黎巴嫩共和国的首都贝鲁特度过了那些令人难忘的日子。贝鲁特是一个非常美丽的城市，它紧靠着地中海滨，风景如画，有“亚洲的花园”之称。一年中，成万的旅行者从世界各国来游历这个美丽的城市。海滨有许多游泳场，许多男女从清早一直到傍晚都在海上游泳和从事滑水运动。
    代表团在访问贝鲁特期间受到了各界人民热情的欢迎。我想在这里特别提到黎巴嫩和平委员会举行的招待中国文化艺术代表团的欢迎茶会。出席这次茶会的有黎巴嫩和平委员会主席、黎巴嫩工程师协会主席安托瓦·塔伯特，参加万隆会议的黎巴嫩代表团团长、前总理萨米·索勒哈，还有前任总理胡赛音·乌艾尼、黎巴嫩法律工作者协会主席法里德·库兹马，以及黎巴嫩各界的著名人士三百余人。茶会在非常热烈友好的气氛中进行。黎巴嫩的著名作家乔治·哈纳先生在会上致词说：“过去，帝国主义力图分化我们的团结。但是，现在你们走到了万隆；我们也走到了万隆。我们和你们找到了团结的道路，我们和你们互相握手，我们和你们都深深地认识到亚非国家间的团结和合作是不可分割的。你们是我们真正的朋友。”我想，通过这位黎巴嫩作家的这几句话，不需要我再来说明黎巴嫩人民对于中国人民的友好的感情了。
    我想特别强调世界上国与国之间加强文化交流与经济合作的重大意义。我们在访问亚非国家时体会到，各国人民不仅要提高自己的物质生活，而且也是热爱文化和艺术的。人民需要文化艺术，而不需要战争。各国人民要求在国际文化与经济交流的基础上求得文化与经济生活的共同高涨。因此，进一步加强国际间的文化与经济交流，就会使全人类争取持久和平的事业得到胜利。
    我国文化艺术代表团这次所以能够胜利的完成访问演出任务，这是代表团全体人员努力的结果，尤其是埃及、苏丹、埃塞俄比亚、叙利亚和黎巴嫩五个国家的政府和人民热情地给予我们许多便利和帮助的结果。我代表我们全体人员向这些好客的国家的政府和人民表示最衷心的谢意。（附图片）
