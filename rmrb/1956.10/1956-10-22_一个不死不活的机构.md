    A Half-Dead Institution
    The Zhejiang Provincial Transportation Planning Commission was established in January 1953, according to the instructions of the former East China Financial Committee and the East China Transportation Planning Commission. Subsequently, transportation planning groups were also established in various special districts, counties (cities). The "Organizational Regulations for the Provincial Transportation Planning Commission" stipulated that the transportation planning commissions at all levels were under the leadership of the financial committees at all levels, responsible for coordinating and balancing the provincial transportation plan, regulating various means of transportation, and inspecting the implementation of the plan.
    With the establishment of the institutions, a total of sixty-seven full-time cadres were transferred throughout the province (excluding the members and part-time cadres of the transportation planning commissions at all levels), of which the office of the Provincial Transportation Planning Commission had twenty-five people. In the initial stage, due to the attention of relevant leaders in East China and the province, certain achievements were indeed made in the work, and some positive results were received. However, after the Financial Committee was abolished in 1954, it has never been clearly answered which institution it belongs to. The transportation planning commissions at all levels have lost regular leadership and are in a state of self-flow in their work. After the abolition of the special and county financial committees, some transportation planning groups ran into walls everywhere when asking for instructions on their work. The financial and trade department of the Party committee does not manage specific business; according to regulations, the Transportation Bureau is still subject to the guidance of the transportation planning commissions at all levels, so it is not convenient to lead them either.
    The office of the Provincial Transportation Planning Commission is also unattended. Since 1954, the committee has not held a single meeting, and no member has inspected the work of the office. The balancing of transportation plans requires cadres, but there is no establishment. The cadres transferred by the transportation planning commissions at all levels were initially temporarily transferred, but were later retained for a long time, and their salaries were still paid by their original units. Therefore, all departments have opinions.
    We have reported to the relevant leaders and leading organs orally or in writing several times, but none of them have been resolved. Only when we encounter a sudden task are we asked to rush; once the rush is over, no one asks about it anymore. We hope that the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee will seriously study this issue. If the work is really needed, it should assign a department to lead it; if the work is not needed, it should be explicitly abolished, and not allowed to remain half-dead.
      Director of the Office of the Zhejiang Provincial Transportation Planning Commission, Liu Quqian

    一个不死不活的机构
    浙江省运输计划委员会是1953年1月，根据前华东财委和华东运输计划委员会的指示成立的。随后，在各专区、县（市）也相继建立了运输计划小组。“省运输计划委员会组织简则”规定，各级运输计划委员会属各级财委领导；负责统筹平衡全省运输计划，调节各种运输工具以及检查计划执行情况。
    随着机构的建立，全省共调集了六十七个专职干部（各级运输计划委员会的委员和兼职干部不在内），其中，省运输计划委员会办公室有二十五人。在开始一个阶段，由于华东和省的有关领导的重视，在工作上的确作出了一定成绩，收到了一些效果。但是，1954年财委撤销后，它究属哪一个机构领导，几年来一直得不到明确答复。各级运输计划委员会失去了经常的领导，在工作上形成自流状态。专、县财委撤销后，有的运输计划小组为了请示工作到处碰壁。党委财贸部不管具体业务；交通局照规定，还受各级运输计划委员会的指导，也不便领导。
    省运输计划委员会办公室也无人管。从1954年以来，委员会没有召开过一次会议，也没有一个委员检查过办公室的工作。运输计划的平衡工作要干部，但编制没有。各级运输计划委员会所调集的干部，开始是作为临时抽调的，后来却被长期留下来，供给仍在原单位开支。因此，各部门都有意见。
    我们曾好几次用口头或书面报告过有关领导人和领导机关，但都得不到解决。只是遇到突击任务，才责成我们赶一赶；突击一完，就没人来过问了。我们希望浙江省人民委员会认真研究一下这个问题，要是工作真的需要，就要责成一个部门来领导；要是工作上不需要，就要明令撤销，不要让它不死不活。
