    Wax Paper in the Eyes of Consumers
    The "Lighthouse Brand" wax paper is a product of the local state-owned Wenzhou Wax Paper Factory, while the "Xinhua Brand" wax paper is a product of the local state-owned Hangzhou Xinhua Wax Paper Factory. People who have used these two types of wax paper believe that their grids are moderate, the waxing is even, the written characters are clear, they do not fuzz, the paper does not tear, the ink is even, and they can print up to about two thousand sheets at a time, and the price is also very cheap. These two types of wax paper are indeed popular with schools and agricultural cooperatives.
                (Bai Yin)
    The "Liberation Brand" wax paper produced by the Tianjin First Stationery Production Cooperative has caused a lot of trouble: the paper is too thick, it fuzzes when writing, and sometimes it will tear if you press down a little harder, and it cannot be corrected. Every word and line printed is black, thick, and blurry, and the lines on the forms break easily. Compared with the "Xinhua Wax Paper" produced by the Hangzhou Local State-owned Xinhua Wax Paper Factory, the quality is not as good as Xinhua wax paper, and the price per hundred sheets of wax paper is five jiao higher.
           (Tang Yuguang)
    Generally, wax paper can print about three to six hundred sheets, but the "Newborn Special Steel Pen Wax Paper" produced by the Newborn Stationery Factory Co., Ltd. only prints about twenty or thirty sheets before ink dots appear. Our unit prints at least two hundred forms at a time, so using this kind of wax paper is very inconvenient! (Shen Guiyuan)
    The "Lion Brand Special Wax Paper" produced by the Shanghai Liwen Arts and Crafts Cooperative looks more beautiful than other wax papers from the outside, but it is easy to fuzz and break when writing; after printing twenty or thirty sheets, it is covered in black spots. At first, I thought my writing skills were poor and I didn't understand the characteristics of wax paper. This idea was quickly refuted, because everyone in the office who had used this wax paper said, "It's terrible." (Xu Xiangrong)
    The "Steel Brand" wax paper produced by the Local State-owned Luda Educational Supplies Factory has little wax and thin paper, and cannot withstand slight rubbing. People call it "tofu brand wax paper." When using this wax paper, you can't press down with your hand, and you can't use too much force when writing, so you need to be very careful. Compared with "Jingzhong," "Lighthouse," and "Kite Brand" wax paper, the quality is far worse. One sheet of Kite brand wax paper can print eight hundred sheets, while Steel brand wax paper can only print two hundred sheets. (Lu Xueliang)

    消费者眼中的蜡纸
    “灯塔牌蜡纸”，是地方国营温州蜡纸厂的产品，“新华牌蜡纸”则是杭州地方国营新华蜡纸厂的产品。使用过这两种蜡纸的人，都认为它们的格子适中，刷蜡均匀，写出字来清晰，不起毛，不烂纸，过墨均匀，最多一次可以印刷两千张左右，价格也很便宜。这两种蜡纸确实受到学校和农业社的欢迎。
                （白印）
    天津市第一文具生产合作社出品“解放牌蜡纸”给人添了不少麻烦：纸太厚、刻写的时候起毛，有时候落笔稍重，就会划破，还不能涂改。印出来的每一个字、每一道线又黑又粗，模糊不清，表格上的线很容易折断。如果和杭州地方国营新华蜡纸厂出品的“新华蜡纸”相比，质量不如新华蜡纸好，每百张蜡纸的价格还高出五角。
           （唐毓光）
    一般蜡纸都能印出三百到六百张左右，可是新生文具厂股份有限公司出品的“新生特种钢笔蜡纸”，顶多印二、三十张就出墨点子了。我们这个单位印一次表格至少是二百张以上，使用这种蜡纸是多么不方便啊！　（沈贵元）
    上海利文工艺社生产的“狮牌特种蜡纸”从外表看来，比别的蜡纸都漂亮，可是，书写时容易起毛又容易破；印刷过二三十张就成了满面黑斑。开始我还认为是自己的写字技术差，不懂得蜡纸的特性。这种想法很快就被否定了，因为机关里凡是使用过这种蜡纸的人都说“太糟糕了”。　（徐湘嵘）
    地方国营旅大文教用品厂出产的“钢铁牌蜡纸”，蜡少纸薄，经不起轻微的磨碰。人都称它为“豆腐牌蜡纸”。使用这种蜡纸，手不能压，写字又不能使大劲，需要十分小心谨慎。跟“警钟”、“灯塔”和“风筝牌”蜡纸比起来，质量差得太远了。一张风筝牌蜡纸可以印八百张，钢铁牌蜡纸只能印二百张。（卢学良）
