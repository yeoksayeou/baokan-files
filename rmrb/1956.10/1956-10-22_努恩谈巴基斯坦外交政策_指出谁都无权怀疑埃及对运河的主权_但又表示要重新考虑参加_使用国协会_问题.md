Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, October 21st: Pakistani Foreign Minister Malik Noon said in Lahore on the 20th that the main purpose of Pakistan's foreign policy is to safeguard Pakistan's interests and follow the principles established by the United Nations Charter. He made the speech at a gathering hosted by the Republican Party to which he belongs.

When he talked about the Suez Canal issue, he said that nationalizing the Suez Canal Company is within the scope of Egypt's sovereignty, and no one has the right to doubt the nationalization.

He also said that since the Suez dispute was submitted to the Security Council and the sting of force was eliminated, Pakistan could reconsider the issue of participating in the "Users' Association." He said that a decision on this issue would be made based on Pakistan's best interests.

Noon described the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact as "defensive" groups. Noon said that because Pakistan is a small country and some countries are hostile to Pakistan, Pakistan joined these treaties for "defense."

Noon advised people to abandon Pan-Islamism and replace it with Pakistani nationalism. He said: "Our primary responsibility is for the Muslims of Pakistan. If a certain country is not friendly to Pakistan, we will not yield to them simply because they are Muslims."

When talking about foreign aid, Noon said that Pakistan is willing to accept aid from all countries.

    努恩谈巴基斯坦外交政策
    指出谁都无权怀疑埃及对运河的主权
    但又表示要重新考虑参加“使用国协会”问题
    新华社卡拉奇21日电　巴基斯坦外交部长马利克·努恩20日在拉合尔说，巴基斯坦外交政策的主旨是维护巴基斯坦利益和遵循联合国宪章所确立的原则。他是在他所属的共和党主持的一个集会上发表演说。
    他在谈到苏伊士运河问题的时候说，把苏伊士运河公司收归国有是埃及主权范围以内的事，任何人无权对国有化发生怀疑。
    他又说，由于苏伊士争端提交安全理事会而消除了武力的毒刺，巴基斯坦可以重新考虑参加“使用国协会”的问题了。他说，将要根据巴基斯坦的最大利益对这一问题作出决定。
    努恩把东南亚条约集团和巴格达条约说成是“防御性”的集团。努恩说，由于巴基斯坦是一个小国而某些国家对巴基斯坦怀有敌意，巴基斯坦为了“防御”才参加了这些条约。
    努恩劝人们放弃泛伊斯兰主义而代之以巴基斯坦主义思想。他说：“我们的首要责任是为了巴基斯坦的穆斯林们。假如有某一个国家对巴基斯坦不友好，我们并不因为他们是穆斯林而对他们屈从。”
    努恩在谈到外国援助的时候说，巴基斯坦愿意接受所有国家提供的援助。
