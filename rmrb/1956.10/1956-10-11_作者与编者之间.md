    Between Authors and Editors
    Zang Kejia

    Flowers need a garden to bloom; a clever wife can't cook without rice. Writers and magazine editors are interdependent. We've heard each other's praises and thanks in words and writing, but complaints are always more frequent than compliments.

    We often hear writers complaining, sometimes even in writing: My article, once it reaches the editor's hands, is hacked to pieces with mighty strokes, leaving it battered and bruised. After publication, I can hardly recognize it as my own work.

    Some complain that editors select and reject manuscripts based on personal preferences, turning the literary garden into a "monochrome" landscape, violating the principle of "letting a hundred flowers bloom," a truly grave sin. More commonly, many young literary contributors attach a letter to their submissions, requesting that if the manuscript is unsuitable, it be "returned promptly with detailed and specific feedback." If this isn't achieved, they erupt in complaints, scolding the editor for being "irresponsible, lazy, and providing abstract and empty feedback that doesn't solve the problem." Some treat the editor's reply as evidence during an "appeal," turning the editor into an "executioner who suppresses emerging forces" and "strangles literary geniuses."

    Editors, on the other hand, are full of grievances. They feel like they are being unsung heroes, "making wedding gowns for others." Unknown authors become famous "writers" in their hands, while they themselves remain in unnoticed corners, diligently doing "ungrateful" work.

    I have listened to editors' "grievances" in meetings more than once. They say with righteous indignation: Everyone scolds us for burying talent, saying we have "wronged ghosts" under our pens. Heaven knows how anxious we are when we publish each month! Writers don't want us to change their articles, but in reality, many articles simply can't be presented to readers without significant revision! As for the general contributors who want us to provide specific and detailed feedback upon rejection, that's an unreasonable request. Our magazine receives tens of thousands of lines of poetry alone each month. If we had to provide feedback for every rejected piece, even if each person had a thousand hands, we couldn't manage it.

    Editors and authors indeed have their own difficulties, and complaints are not without reason. But I believe that as an editor, the approach of "acting first and reporting later" regarding an author's article is not good. If an article needs to be revised, the author's consent must be obtained. If the author disagrees, both parties have the freedom not to publish. For works that don't align with one's own tastes, I hope one chews on them again and again, rather than rejecting them after a "superficial taste." For the works of young comrades, we must see their youthful vitality within their immaturity.

    As authors, we should also try to understand the hard work and difficulties of the comrades engaged in editing. We can raise opinions for common discussion and should not treat each other with hostile emotions.

    Authors and editors should replace complaints with understanding. Of course, understanding doesn't include errors and unreasonable aspects in work and requirements.

    作者与编者之间
    臧克家
    花开需要园地；无米之炊，巧妇为难，作家和杂志编辑是相依为命的。我们在口头上，在文字里，也听见过彼此称颂和感谢的声音，可是互相埋怨的时候总比唱颂歌的时候多。
    常听到作家抱怨，有时也形诸文字：我的文章到了编辑先生手里，他挥大笔如抡斧斤，被砍削得七零八碎，鳞伤遍体，刊出以后，我自己几乎不认识是出自己手了。
    有的抱怨编辑以个人的爱好取舍稿件，使文艺园地成了“清一色”，有违“百花齐放”之旨，实在罪孽深重。更普遍的是许多青年文艺投稿者，他们在投稿的时候，总要附上一封信，要求稿子万一不合用时，“望即退还，并详细地、具体地提出意见”。要是达不到目的，便大发牢骚，骂编辑“不负责任，偷懒，所提意见抽象空洞，不解决问题”。有的把编辑的回信当作“上诉”时的罪证，编辑成了“压制新生力量”，“扼杀文艺天才”的刽子手。
    作编辑的，更是满腹不平。他们觉得自己是在做无名英雄，是在“为他人作嫁女裳”，“无名”的作者，在他们手里成了声名赫赫的“作家”，而自己呢，依然坐在没人注意的角落里辛辛苦苦地做着“费力不讨好的”工作。
    我不只一次聆听过编辑同志们在会议上“鸣不平”，他们义气填胸地说：都骂我们埋没了天才，说我们笔下有“冤鬼”，天知道，我们每月发稿时候那种焦急的心情！作家不愿意我们改动他们的文章，可是，实际上，许多文章不大加改削就简直没法和读者见面！至于一般投稿的要我们退稿时附既具体又详细的意见，这更是无理要求，我们的杂志仅就诗说，每月就收到几万行，要我们篇篇退稿都附意见，每个人生一千只手也忙不过来。
    编者和作者的确各有自己的苦衷，抱怨也不是无缘无故。但我觉得，作为编辑，对于作家的文章，“先斩后奏”的办法是不好的，文章需要修改，一定要征求作者同意，作者如不同意，双方都有不发表的自由。对于和自己胃口不投合的作品，希望一嚼再嚼，不要“浅尝”之后，便唾弃了它。对于青年同志们的作品，要从稚嫩中看到它青春的活力。
    作为作者，对于从事编辑的同志，也应当设身处地地想一想他们的辛苦和难处，有意见可以提出来共同商量，不要以敌对的情绪相对待。
    作者、编者彼此应该以体谅代替抱怨，当然，体谅不包括工作上、要求里错误与不合理的地方。
