    National Print Exhibition Opens
    (Our newspaper's report) The "Second National Print Exhibition" opened on the Shenwumen tower of the Palace Museum on the 22nd.
    A total of 350 works by 150 new and veteran printmakers are on display this time, almost doubling the number of works in the first National Print Exhibition. Many works reflect the magnificent scenes of China's socialist construction and the increasingly improved happy life of the people; some works show the preliminary reconstruction of water conservancy projects and the beautiful landscape after the liberation of the working people, including dozens of commemorative works depicting the life of Lu Xun. The style of the works is also much more diverse than the last time. It is gratifying that many young printmakers have emerged in the past two years. Among them, the works of Luo Tan, Di Jie, Mo Ce, Wu Fan, etc., are all quite well engraved and full of vigorous vitality.

    全国版画展览会开幕
    本报讯　“第二届全国版画展览会”，22日在故宫博物院神武门楼上开幕。
    这次展出的，共有一百五十位新老版画家的三百五十幅作品。比第一届全国版画展览会上的作品几乎增加了一倍。许多作品反映了我国社会主义建设的壮丽画面，和日益改善的人民的幸福生活；一部分作品，表现着经过解放后劳动人民初步改建的水利工程和美丽的山河风光，其中还有描写鲁迅生平事迹等纪念作品数十幅。作品的风格，也比上次多得多了。令人欣幸的是，在这两年当中，涌现出许多年青的版画作者。其中如：骆坦、邸杰、莫测、吴凡等的作品，都刻得相当好，充满着蓬勃的朝气。
