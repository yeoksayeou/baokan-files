    Guarantee a Bumper Harvest
    Yunnan Strives to Reduce Grain Loss by 100 Million Jin
    (Our dispatch) To ensure a bumper harvest, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Provincial Democratic Women's Federation are mobilizing young people and women throughout the province to do a good job in the autumn harvest. They are striving to reduce grain loss by six jin per mu, and working hard to increase the province's grain income by 100 million jin.
    This year, Yunnan Province's 15.7 million mu of rice is growing better and ripening more evenly than in previous years, and the harvest will begin soon. However, according to the meteorological station's forecast, there will be more rainfall this autumn. Therefore, the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Provincial Women's Federation require all young people and women in the province to do everything possible to drain water as soon as the rice heads bow, and to rush the harvest as soon as it is ripe. They should harvest one field as soon as it turns yellow, and do the cutting, carrying, drying and distribution simultaneously, to ensure that grain is not lost.
    In the autumn harvest, it is also necessary to do a good job in flood prevention, animal protection, fire prevention and the prevention of special incidents. At all times and in all places, vigilance must be maintained to prevent all possible losses.

    保证丰产丰收
    云南争取减少粮食损耗一亿斤
    本报讯　为了保证丰产丰收，青年团云南省委会和省民主妇女联合会动员全省青年和妇女，做好秋收工作，争取每亩地减少粮食损耗六斤，为全省多收入一亿斤粮食而努力。
    今年云南省的一千五百七十万亩水稻，比往年长得好、熟得齐，目前即将开始收割。但据气象台预测，今年秋季雨量比较多，为此，团省委和省妇联要求全省青年、妇女尽一切力量作到谷子低头就排水，成熟就抢收；黄一丘，收一丘；边割、边挑、边晒、边分，保证粮食不受损失。
    在秋收中还要做好防洪、防兽和防火、防特等工作，随时随地都要警惕和防止一切可能遭到的损失。
