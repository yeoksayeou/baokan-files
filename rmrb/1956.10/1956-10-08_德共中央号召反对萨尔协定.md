    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th (TASS dispatch) - The Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued a statement on the Saar issue, calling on all democratic forces and patriots in Germany to rise up against the Saar agreement signed by West German Chancellor Adenauer and French Prime Minister Mollet.
    The statement emphasizes that the only way to completely resolve the Saar issue is through mutual consultation between the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, the government of the German Democratic Republic, and the Saar local authorities on the one hand, and the French government on the other.
    The German Communist Party believes that any decision regarding the future of the Saar region should first be agreed upon by the residents of the Saar region themselves. Therefore, the new regulations regarding the Saar made according to the Adenauer-Mollet agreement should also be subject to a popular vote.

    德共中央号召反对萨尔协定
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社柏林7日讯：德国共产党中央委员会就萨尔问题发表了一项声明，号召德国的一切民主力量和爱国者起来反对西德总理阿登纳和法国总理摩勒所签订的关于萨尔问题的协定。
    这项声明着重指出，彻底解决萨尔问题的途径只能有一条，那就是，德意志联邦共和国政府、德意志民主共和国政府和萨尔地方当局为一方，法国政府为另一方，互相进行协商。
    德国共产党认为，关于萨尔地区前途的任何决定首先应该得到萨尔地区居民自己的同意。因此，根据阿登纳——摩勒协定所作出的关于萨尔的新规定也应该经过人民投票。
