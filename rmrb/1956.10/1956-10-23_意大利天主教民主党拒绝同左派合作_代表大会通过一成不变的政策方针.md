Xinhua News Agency, Rome, October 22nd (TASS): The Sixth Congress of the Italian Christian Democratic Party, held in Trento, has concluded. The congress elected a new National Committee, in which the so-called "Democratic Initiative Group," led by party secretary Fanfani, secured a two-thirds majority of seats.

The congress adopted a resolution on the party's policy guidelines, which rejected the idea of cooperation with the left and reaffirmed its commitment to "political and economic solidarity among Atlantic nations." The policy guidelines outlined in the resolution are no different from those previously pursued, being based on opposing communism, safeguarding the interests of monopoly groups, and heeding the authority of the Catholic Church.

"l'Unità," in commenting on the congress's resolution, emphasized that the Christian Democratic Party has been "completely controlled by groups and individuals whose positions are out of touch with reality."

Many observers believe that the Christian Democratic Party congress failed to address the main issues in the current political situation. They point out that one of the most important issues facing the Christian Democratic Party is the question of cooperation with Italy's democratic forces. Among the party's grassroots organizations and Catholic trade unions, the movement in favor of cooperation with left-wing party groups has strengthened. Some delegates attending the congress also advocated for united action among various organizations of working people.

Their speeches, as well as the speech by the General Secretary of the Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions, Pastore, indicated that the possibility of achieving significant social reforms in the country is doubtful without the participation of the broad masses of working people organized in left-wing organizations.

    意大利天主教民主党拒绝同左派合作
    代表大会通过一成不变的政策方针
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：在特伦多举行的意大利天主教民主党第六次代表大会已经闭幕。代表大会选举了新的全国委员会，以党的书记范范尼为首的所谓“民主主动派”在全国委员会中获得了三分之二的多数席位。
    代表大会通过了关于党的政策方针的决议，这个决议拒绝了同左派合作的主张，并且重申忠实于“大西洋各国在政治上和经济上的团结一致”。决议所表明的政策方针同以往奉行的没有什么不同，它是建立在反对共产主义、维护垄断集团利益以及听命于天主教会的当权人士的基础上的。
      “团结报”在评论代表大会的决议的时候强调指出，天主教民主党已经“完全为那些立场违背现实状况的集团和人物所掌握”。
    许多观察家认为，天主教民主党的代表大会没有解决目前政治局势中的主要问题。他们指出，天主教民主党所面临的最重要的问题之一是同意大利的民主力量合作的问题。在党的基层组织和天主教工会中间，赞成同左翼党派团体实行合作的运动已经加强了。出席大会的一些代表也都主张在劳动人民的各种组织间采取一致行动。
    他们的发言以及意大利劳动人民工会联合会总书记帕斯托雷的发言都表示如果没有加入左翼组织的广大劳动群众的参加，在国内实现巨大的社会改革的可能性是值得怀疑的。
