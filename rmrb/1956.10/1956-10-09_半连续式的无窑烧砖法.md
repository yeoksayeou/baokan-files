　　Semi-Continuous Kiln-Free Brick Firing Method

　　This newspaper reports that the brick and tile factory of the Tongchuan Engineering Office of the Xi'an Coal Mine Construction Bureau has successfully tested the "semi-continuous kiln-free brick firing method". This brick firing method does not use a kiln, but only a rectangular trapezoidal wall with fire channels at the bottom. Brick blanks are stacked inside the wall, and a layer of straw mud is laid on top. When loading the brick blanks, the first five kiln pits are loaded, and then the fire is lit to fire the bricks. Then, the remaining five kiln pits can be loaded. After the back five pits are loaded, the first loaded kiln pits can be unloaded. This cycle continues, so bricks can be produced every day. Moreover, it only takes more than 14 hours to fire 10,000 bricks, which is 3-4 hours shorter than the commonly used tunnel kiln and pot kiln brick firing methods. Coal consumption can also be reduced by 10% to 12% or more. Using this kiln firing method can save 74.26% of the investment compared to building a tunnel kiln, and the output is 11.1% higher than that of a tunnel kiln. At the same time, the quality of the bricks fully meets the standards, and production is relatively safe, without cracking or collapse accidents.

　　半连续式的无窑烧砖法
    本报讯　最近，西安煤矿基建局铜川工程处砖瓦厂试验“半连续式的无窑烧砖法成功”。这种烧砖法不用窑，只有一道长方梯形围墙，底层有火道，围墙里码砖坯，顶上还铺一层草泥。在装砖坯的时候，先装好五个窑坑，就开始点火烧砖，然后就可以继续装剩下的五个窑坑，待后边的五个坑装好以后，先装的窑坑即可出砖。这样不断循环，不仅每天可以出砖，而且烧制一万块砖只要十四小时多，比目前常用的串窑、罐窑烧砖法还缩短三、四小时，煤耗量还可降低10％至12％以上。用这种烧窑法比建立串窑能节约74.26％的投资，产量比串窑多11.1％，同时，砖的质量完全合乎标准，生产也比较安全，不会发生涨裂和倒塌的事故。
