Xinhua News Agency, October 30th dispatch from New York: The United Nations Security Council met at 4:15 PM New York time on October 28th to discuss the request by the United States, Britain, and France to include the item “The Situation in Hungary” on the Security Council's agenda.

    After the Security Council meeting was convened under the chairmanship of the French representative, Mr. Cornut-Gentille, the Soviet representative, Mr. Sobolev, spoke on procedural matters. He said that it must be pointed out that today's convening of the Security Council disrupts the Security Council's existing traditions. The President of the Security Council did not consult with many Security Council member states, including the Soviet Union, when deciding on the date of the meeting. Such disregard for certain member states is unacceptable. Furthermore, convening an emergency meeting of the Security Council on the Hungarian issue does not meet the requirements of the current situation.
    Mr. Cornut-Gentille attempted to defend his actions, saying that he decided to hold the meeting on Sunday because some Security Council member states had requested an emergency meeting.
    Mr. Sobolev reiterated that convening the meeting in this way violated the Security Council's traditional rules of procedure.
    After Mr. Sobolev spoke, the French representative, who was chairing the Security Council meeting, attempted to put the question of including “The Situation in Hungary” on the Security Council's agenda to a vote without any discussion.
    The Soviet representative, Mr. Sobolev, opposed the inclusion of the issue raised by the United States, Britain, and France on the agenda. He pointed out that Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the United Nations Charter stipulates that the Charter "does not authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state."
    The Soviet representative said that the statement of the government of the Hungarian People's Republic on October 28th of this year clearly pointed out that it "strongly protests the inclusion of any issue belonging to Hungarian internal affairs on the agenda," and the statement said that this is because "United Nations discussions of such issues would constitute a serious violation of the sovereignty of the Hungarian People's Republic and a clear violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter."
    Mr. Sobolev pointed out that the Soviet delegation would vote against including the issue raised by the three Western powers on the agenda.
    The Yugoslav representative, Mr. Brilej, said that bringing the Hungarian issue to the Security Council would only complicate the situation in Hungary and the world. He said that difficulties should not be created for the Hungarian government's work in restoring order.
    He said that because Yugoslavia "is opposed in principle to the presence of foreign troops," he would abstain from voting on the question of including “The Situation in Hungary” on the agenda.
    A vote was then held, and a majority voted in favor of including the issue raised by the three Western powers on the agenda. The Soviet representative voted against the decision. The Yugoslav representative abstained.
    The Soviet representative suggested postponing the discussion for three or four days so that the council members could obtain the necessary information and understand it, but this proposal was also opposed by a majority of the council members.
    Near the end of the meeting, the Hungarian representative, Mr. Peter Kos, who had been invited to attend the Security Council meeting, spoke. He expressed regret over the Security Council's discussion of Hungary's internal affairs. He said that his attitude towards this issue had been clarified in his letter, which had been circulated as an official United Nations document.
    At 9:50 PM New York time on October 29th, the chairman announced the adjournment of the Security Council meeting. The date of the next meeting would be decided after consultation with the council members.

### 安理会通过把美英法提案列入议程  苏联代表说这一决定违反宪章

    安理会通过把美英法提案列入议程
    苏联代表说这一决定违反宪章
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国安全理事会10月28日纽约时间下午四时十五分开会讨论美、英、法三国要求将“匈牙利局势”这个项目列入安理会议程的问题。
    在安理会主席、法国代表戈尔尼—让蒂主持开会后，苏联代表索波列夫就程序问题发言。他说，必须指出，今天安理会的召开破坏了安理会现有的传统。安理会主席在决定会议日期时并没有同包括苏联在内的许多安理会理事国磋商。这种不重视某些理事国的作法是不能容许的。此外，安理会召开关于匈牙利问题的紧急会议是不符合当前情况的要求的。
    戈尔尼—让蒂企图为自己的行为辩护，他说，他决定星期日开会，是因为安理会一些理事国要求召开紧急会议。
    索波列夫再次发言指出，这样召开会议是违反安理会传统的议事规则的。
    在索波列夫发言后，担任安全理事会会议主席的法国代表企图不通过任何讨论就将把“匈牙利的局势”这一项列入安理会议程的问题提付表决。
    苏联代表索波列夫反对把美、英、法三国提出的问题列入议程。他指出，联合国宪章第二条第七款规定，宪章“不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件”。
    苏联代表说，匈牙利人民共和国政府今年10月28日的声明明确地指出了，它“坚决抗议把任何属于匈牙利内政的问题列入议程”，声明说，这是因为，“联合国讨论这类问题就是严重侵犯匈牙利人民共和国的主权以及明显违反联合国宪章的原则”。
    索波列夫指出，苏联代表团将投票反对把西方三国提出的问题列入议程。
    南斯拉夫代表布里列伊说，把匈牙利的问题提到安全理事会只会使匈牙利和全世界的局势复杂化。他说，不应当给匈牙利政府恢复秩序的工作造成困难。
    他说，因为南斯拉夫“在原则上反对外国军队的出现”，所以在把“匈牙利局势”一项列入议程问题上进行表决时他将弃权。
    接着举行投票，多数票赞成把西方三国提出的问题列入议程。苏联代表投票反对这个决定。南斯拉夫代表弃权。
    苏联代表建议把讨论推迟三、四天，以便理事们获得必要的情报并了解这些情报，但是这个提议也遭到多数理事的反对。
    会议快结束时，被邀请参加安理会会议的匈牙利代表彼得·科什发言。他对安理会讨论匈牙利内务问题一事表示遗憾。他说，他对这个问题的态度在作为联合国正式文件散发的他的信中已经阐明。
    10月29日纽约时间二十一时五十分，主席宣布安理会会议结束，下次会议的召开在同理事磋商后决定。
