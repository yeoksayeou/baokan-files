Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 13th: Hong Kong News: Although the Kowloon riots have continued for three days, all the facts show that the Hong Kong British authorities have not taken resolute and effective measures to stop them. Yesterday, the scope of the riots further expanded, and the number of participants continued to increase.

\tYesterday, although the British side announced the continuation of martial law in Kowloon, the rioters continued to operate in all directions, setting fires and looting as usual, and attacking factories, shops, and ordinary residents everywhere. At about 10:00 AM, a group of bandits gathered on Castle Peak Road attacked a shop at number 279, looted the shop, and set it on fire. No British military or police arrived at the scene. Subsequently, the rioters looted a silk shop downstairs from the Hotel Imperial on Nathan Road, destroyed the shop, and injured the employees. At 11:30 AM, the rioters attacked the Manley Film Studio again, throwing stones at the film studio for a long time. The employees of the Manley Film Studio called the police many times, but no British military or police arrived, and the rioters left after committing their crimes. At 1:00 PM, the rioters attacked the new campus of Heung To Middle School, which had been set on fire by rioters as early as the night of the 10th. British troops originally resided on the second floor of the school building, but when the rioters arrived, the British troops withdrew. The rioters then entered the school, looted the remaining property, completely destroyed the furniture, and set the house on fire. The fire was so large that it could be seen from a great distance. However, the British fire department never sent a vehicle to put out the fire. The fire burned for more than an hour, and the new campus of the school is now only a charred shell.

\tAccording to workers who escaped from the Tsuen Wan industrial area, British troops did not enter Tsuen Wan until six hours after the rioters turned Tsuen Wan into a world of terror on the night of the 11th. At 6:00 PM on the 11th, several thousand rioters gathered in Tsuen Wan, led by people holding Kuomintang flags. The rioters all wore white towels on their arms and Kuomintang party badges made of cloth on their chests. They first burned the trucks parked at the entrance of the Xinhua Enamel Factory, and then rushed into the Po Shing Cotton Mill. As soon as the rioters arrived, the British police withdrew. Therefore, the rioters smoothly used the factory's cotton as kindling to set fires and beat the workers. After the rioters destroyed part of the factory's machinery, they attacked the Tsuen Wan Workers' United Clinic, the Silk Weaving Industry General Union, and the Tsuen Wan Service Department of the Textile Dyeing Workers' Union in three routes. During the attack, the rioters dragged 37 employees of the Tsuen Wan Workers' United Clinic and other units to parade through the streets of Tsuen Wan, beating them as they went. The police officers on the street hid in the police station. The rioters held knives, swords, sticks, iron bars, and other sharp weapons. Yesterday afternoon, the bodies of more than ten of these 37 people, men and women, were found lying on the road between the Silk Weaving Workers' Union and the Planting General Union. The whereabouts of the remaining people are unknown. While the rioters were parading in Tsuen Wan, they raped women on the streets. When the rioters attacked the Silk Weaving Workers' Union, four workers tried to escape from the rooftop, but they were caught by the rioters and beaten to death. The rioters then attacked the Planting Workers' Union and the Enamel Workers' Union. Several people from the Planting Workers' Union were kidnapped, and more than a dozen people from the Enamel Workers' Union were kidnapped to the seaside opposite the Texaco oil depot. The rioters threatened to fill the sea with these people.

\tIt was not until 12:30 AM that British troops arrived in Tsuen Wan, at which time the rioters had dispersed.

    香港英国当局没有坚决制止九龙骚乱
    国民党特务继续行凶抢掠烧杀
    新华社广州13日电　香港消息：虽然九龙骚乱已继续了三天，但种种事实表明，香港英国当局一直没有采取坚决而有效的措施来加以制止。在昨天，骚乱范围更加扩大，参加骚乱的人数续有增加。
    昨天英方虽然宣布九龙继续戒严，但暴徒们仍四出活动，照常纵火抢劫，到处袭击工厂、商店和一般居民。上午十时许，集结青山道上的一群匪徒袭击一家商店二七九号，把这家商店劫掠一空，并纵火焚烧，始终未有英国军警到场。接着，暴徒们就劫掠弥敦道琼华酒店楼下一家丝绸店，并捣毁商店，殴伤员工。十一时半，暴徒们再度袭击万里影片厂，用石块向影片厂掷去，历时甚久。万里影片厂职工曾多次打电话报警，但无英国军警到场，暴徒们逞凶后呼啸而去。下午一时，暴徒们又一次袭击早在10日夜就遭暴徒纵火的香岛中学新校舍。校舍二楼原住有英军，但当暴徒到达时，英军就撤走了。于是暴徒进入校内，将上次未劫完之财物抢掠一空，把家具彻底破坏，并纵火烧屋，火势甚大，在很远的地方都可以看见。但英方的消防局始终不派车前往扑救。大火燃烧了一个多钟头，该校新校舍现只剩下一幢焦黑的空壳。
    据从荃湾工业区脱险出来的工人说，11日夜间，在暴徒把荃湾变成恐怖世界六个多小时以后，英国军队才开进荃湾。11日晚六时，有几千暴徒集队到了荃湾，为首的人持国民党旗帜。暴徒一律手上扎白巾，胸佩布质的国民党党徽。他们首先将新华搪瓷厂门口停放的货车焚毁，跟着冲入宝星纱厂。暴徒一到，英国警察就撤走了。所以暴徒们顺利地用工厂棉花作引燃物纵火，并殴打工友。暴徒把工厂部分机器捣毁后，分三路袭击荃湾工人联合诊所、丝织业总工会、纺织染工会荃湾服务部。在进攻的时候，暴徒们把荃湾工人联合诊所等单位三十七个职工拉到荃湾游街，边行边打，街上岗警躲入警署。暴徒所持凶器有刀、剑、棍、铁棒等利器。昨天下午发现这三十七人中的十多人的尸体，有男有女，倒在丝织工会和种植总工会之间的马路上，其余人不知下落。暴徒在荃湾游行时，竟在大街上强奸妇女。在暴徒攻打丝织工会时，有四个工人想从天台逃走，但逃不及，被暴徒抓住，活活打死。暴徒接着袭击种植工会、搪瓷工会。种植工会有几人被绑架，搪瓷工会有十几人被绑架到德士古油库对面海边，暴徒扬言要将这些人填海。
    直到夜深十二时半，英军才开到荃湾，这时暴徒已分别散去了。
