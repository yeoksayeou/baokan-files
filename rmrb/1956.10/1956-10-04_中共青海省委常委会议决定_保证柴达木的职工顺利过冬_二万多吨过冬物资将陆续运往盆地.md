According to the Qinghai Daily, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) recently held its 44th Standing Committee meeting, specifically to study the winter needs of exploration personnel and staff in the Qaidam Basin.

This winter, over 60,000 exploration personnel and staff will be working in the Qaidam Basin. The lowest temperature in the basin has already reached -5 degrees Celsius, making it crucial to ensure that all workers in the Qaidam Basin can work victoriously and healthily throughout the winter. The CPC Qinghai Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have already instructed relevant provincial units to actively prepare various winter supplies and have assigned leading cadres from relevant units to form a Qaidam Winter Problem Group to specifically plan and lead this work.

The most significant current difficulty is that transportation capacity cannot keep up with the demand, and many winter supplies, such as staple and non-staple foods, coal, stoves, and cotton clothing, cannot be transported to the basin in time. The Provincial Committee has decided to adopt the method of "local sourcing and local supply," such as establishing an abattoir in Haixi to solve the meat supply problem in the basin locally. The Provincial Committee also instructed the Department of Transportation to use existing transportation capacity in an organized and planned manner, coordinate with relevant departments to make internal adjustments, and allocate an additional 163 vehicles from the Provincial Department of Transportation to the Qaidam Transportation Company in addition to the existing 337 vehicles, so that all winter equipment and supplies can be delivered to the exploration personnel more quickly.

Regarding the supply of staple and non-staple foods and daily necessities for personnel in the basin this winter and next spring, the Provincial Committee instructed the Provincial Grain Bureau and the Department of Commerce to assign special personnel to do a good job in allocation and matching, so that 20,258 tons of grain, urgently needed pork, beef, mutton, canned food, and over 4,000 tons of general merchandise can be shipped at any time.

The climate in the Qaidam Basin is severely cold in winter, and long-term living in tents is not suitable for winter work. According to investigations, the basin workers are currently short of over 68,900 square meters of various types of housing. Therefore, the Provincial Committee instructed that in addition to continuing to build earth-wood structure houses and allocating wooden houses, the focus should be on increasing the number of prefabricated houses. All prefabricated houses must be delivered to their destinations ahead of schedule, no later than mid-December; and they should be used as soon as they arrive and used rationally.

In order to fully supply coal for the basin in winter, the Provincial Committee instructed relevant units to do a good job in the production management and development of existing coal mines in Yuka, Delingha, Xidatan, Datouyang, and other places, and to make full use of existing equipment to improve production efficiency.

    中共青海省委常委会议决定
    保证柴达木的职工顺利过冬
    二万多吨过冬物资将陆续运往盆地
    据青海日报讯　中共青海省委员会最近召开第四十四次常务委员会，专门研究柴达木盆地勘探人员和各方面工作人员过冬问题。
    今年冬季，将有六万多名勘探人员和工作人员在柴达木盆地坚持工作。目前盆地最低气温已达零下五度，因此如何保证柴达木盆地全体职工在冬季胜利而健康地工作，就显得十分重要。中共青海省委和省人民委员会早已指示省属各有关单位积极准备各种过冬物资，并责成各有关单位负责干部组成柴达木过冬问题小组，专门筹划和领导这一工作。
    当前最主要的困难是运输力量赶不上需要，很多过冬物资如主副食品、燃煤、火炉、棉衣等不能及时运到盆地。省委决定采取“就近取材、就近供应”的办法，如在海西建立屠宰场就近解决盆地肉食问题。省委并指示交通厅应有组织有计划地使用现有运输力量，协同有关部门进行内部调整，除原有的三百三十七辆汽车外，再由省交通厅调拨一百六十三辆汽车给柴达木运输公司，使所有过冬装备和物资都能加快地运到勘探人员手里。
    关于今冬明春盆地人员的主、副食品和日用百货的供应，省委责成省粮食局和商业厅指派专人作好调拨、搭配工作，以使两万零二百五十八吨粮食，急需的猪、牛、羊肉、罐头食品和四千多吨百货都能随时启运。
    柴达木盆地冬季气候严寒，长期住布帐房是不能适应冬季工作的。据调查，盆地职工现尚缺各种住房六万八千九百多平方公尺，因此，省委指示除继续修建土木结构房屋，调拨木质房屋外，应以增添活动房屋为主。所有活动房屋都必须争取提前运到目的地，最迟不得超过十二月中旬；并且做到房屋随到随用，合理使用。
    为了充分供应盆地冬季用煤，省委指示有关单位必须做好鱼卡、德令哈、西大滩、大头羊等地现有煤矿生产管理和开发工作，充分利用现有设备，提高生产效率。
