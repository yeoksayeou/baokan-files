    Agricultural Cooperatives and Handicraft Cooperatives Each Hold Their Own Views
    Changlinhe Town, Feidong County, Anhui Province, is a small rural town with over two hundred households. In addition to commercial activities, there are handicrafts serving agriculture, mainly including five iron workshops with eleven workers, five carpentry workshops with sixteen workers, and eight bamboo weaving workshops with thirty-seven workers. These artisans successively established cooperatives in the autumn of 1955. Their production (whether manufacturing new items or repairing old ones) is more than 80% agricultural tools. Therefore, farmers in the four or five townships near the town have always been their customers.

    After the rural cooperativization, their customers not only did not increase but decreased. Why? Farmers from the four townships near the town jointly established the Xingguang Agricultural Cooperative in the winter of 1955. Among the more than four thousand households in the cooperative, there were eighteen ironworkers, forty-two carpenters, and fourteen bamboo weavers. Some of these people originally worked elsewhere and returned to join the agricultural cooperative during the high tide of cooperativization; others were part-time artisans who worked in the fields during busy farming seasons and did handicrafts during slack seasons. However, they did little work locally, and mostly traveled to cities and villages with their tools. After joining the cooperative, in order to leverage their skills and meet the cooperative's needs, they were organized into a handicraft production team, with three production groups for ironwork, carpentry, and bamboo weaving, to manufacture new farm tools and repair old ones for the cooperative. In just eight months, they manufactured over three thousand various farm tools and repaired over three thousand large and small farm tools, which not only met the needs of the cooperative but were also purchased by members of other cooperatives through personal connections.

    Thus, the contradiction arose. The professional handicraftsmen in the town had no work to do, and their manufactured products could not be sold. Taking ironwork as an example, in previous years, more than a thousand sickles would be sold during the wheat harvest season, but this year, not even five hundred were sold, leaving more than twelve hundred in stock. In addition, there were more than two hundred shovels and six hundred hoes in stock. The repair of old farm tools also decreased. In previous years, they were so busy working through the night during the wheat harvest season that they couldn't keep up, but now they hardly get five or six items a day. The bamboo weaving industry is even more serious. Every year during the rice planting season, several thousand bamboo rain capes would be sold, but this year, they went around to the surrounding agricultural cooperatives to solicit contracts, but most cooperatives refused because they had people within the cooperative who could make them. Therefore, in March of this year, the town's handicrafts industry was once shut down. Some sought introductions from the government to work in the Hefei farm tool factory, and some simply changed careers to become temporary workers. Now only five people in the iron industry remain in the cooperative to maintain the facade; the carpentry industry has also almost entirely gone elsewhere. This has seriously affected the production and lives of the professional handicraft cooperative members. They believe that the agricultural cooperative has squeezed their livelihoods and demand a quick solution.

    How to solve it? The agricultural cooperative and the handicraft cooperative have also consulted with each other, but they each hold their own views and have not resolved the issue. The agricultural cooperative's opinion: cooperative members who know handicrafts should be allowed to do handicrafts. It is also convenient for the cooperative. They can make whatever farm tools are needed, and farm tools can be repaired immediately when they break. Members can bring tools to the fields and repair them as they break, without delaying farming. However, the handicraft cooperative believes that the agricultural cooperative should not "ride two horses at once." The handicraftsmen in the agricultural cooperative are not professionals and should focus on agricultural production. The agricultural cooperative's farm tools should be supplied by the handicraft cooperative, and broken tools should also be repaired by the handicraft cooperative. Thus, the problem remains unresolved. In a helpless situation, the handicraft cooperative stopped formulating supply plans for iron, wood, and bamboo materials for the handicraft production team in the agricultural cooperative, further exacerbating the conflict.

    This problem urgently needs to be studied and resolved in various regions. Xiao Kefei

### 农业社同手工业社各持己见

    农业社同手工业社各持己见
    安徽肥东县长临河镇，是一个拥有二百多户的农村小集镇。这里除了商业活动以外，还有为农业服务的手工业，其中主要的有铁业五户，十一个工人；木业五户，十六个工人；篾业八户，三十七个工人。这些手工业者们在1955年秋季都相继办起合作社。他们的生产（不论是制造新的，修理旧的），农具占80％以上。因此，在镇子附近的四、五个乡的农民，一直是他们的顾客。
    农村合作化后，他们的顾客不但没有多起来，反而减少了。为什么呢？靠近镇边四个乡的农民，在1955年冬季联合起来办了一个星光农业社，全社四千多户当中，就有铁工十八人，木工四十二人，篾工十四人。这些人，有的原来在外地做工，合作化高潮到了，他们回来参加农业社；有的是兼做手工业，农忙时下田生产，农闲了就做手艺。但是在本地做的少，而带着工具出去游城串乡的多。入社之后，社内为了发挥他们的特长，同时也为了社内的需要，就把他们组织成一个手工业生产队，下设铁业、木业、篾业三个生产组，为社内制造新农具、修理旧农具。在短短的八个月里，他们共制造了各种农具三千多件，修理大、小农具三千多件，不但满足了社内需要，其他社的社员还通过社员关系来购买。
    矛盾就这样发生了。镇上的专业手工业没有活干了，制造的成品也销不出了。单以铁业为例，往年一个麦场，割麦的锯镰就要销出一千多张，今年连五百张也没有销出去，以致存着一千二百多张。此外，大锹还存着二百多把，锄头六百多张。修理旧农具也减少了。往年麦场时，连夜工作也忙不过来，现在整天也摊不上五、六件。篾业更严重，每年栽秧季节，要销出几千顶背蓬（雨具），可是今年他们跑遍了周围农业社去订合同，但大部分因为社内有人会做而不要。因此，在今年三月里，镇上的手工业曾一度歇业，他们有的找政府介绍到合肥农具厂去做工，有的就干脆改行去做临时工，现在铁业只有五个人留在社内维持门面；木业也几乎全部到外地去了。这样，严重的影响了专业手工业社社员的生产和生活。他们认为农业社把他们的饭碗挤掉了，要求赶快解决。
    怎样解决呢？农业社也同手工业社之间进行商量，但是各持己见，没有解决。农业社的意见：会手艺的社员，应该给他们做手艺，社内也便利，要什么农具造什么农具，农具坏了马上修理，社员能带着工具到田里、地里随坏随修，不误农时。但是手工业社就认为农业社不能“一马双挂”，农业社的手工业者并不是专业，应该以农业生产为主，农业社用的农具应该由手工业社来供应，坏了的，也由手工业社来修理。这样，问题还是没有解决。手工业社在无可奈何的情况下，就不给农业社里的手工业生产队编造铁、木、竹等的用料供应计划，以致矛盾更加尖锐化。
    这个问题，是急需要各地研究解决的。　萧克非
