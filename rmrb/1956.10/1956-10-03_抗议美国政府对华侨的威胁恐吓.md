    Protest Against the U.S. Government's Threats and Intimidation of Overseas Chinese
    To the Editor:
    Over the past few months, I have been receiving letters from an old classmate living in the United States, which have mentioned the situation of our compatriots in the United States.
    In a letter dated March 15th of this year, she said: "Recently, the lives of overseas Chinese in San Francisco (note: i.e., San Francisco) have been very unstable because the U.S. government has sent people to investigate Chinese organizations (overseas Chinese groups) and demand lists of names. If a person is found to have two names, there is a possibility of imprisonment." In a letter dated June 1st, she talked about the situation in New York: "At this time, the overseas Chinese in the United States are in the most miserable situation, as you can imagine... especially with the recent investigation of Chinese organizations, the entire overseas Chinese community is showing a depressed atmosphere. Few people go to Chinatown anymore (note: Chinatown refers to the place where Chinese compatriots live), because of the interrogations in the street."
    The letter also mentioned that, in addition to these threats, the U.S. government also uses various propaganda organizations to deceive and intimidate overseas Chinese. For example, they say that in China "people are not allowed to have radios," "grain is rationed every few days," "after returning to the mainland, they are not allowed to leave Hong Kong," and so on, trying every possible means to prevent overseas Chinese from returning to their country, attempting to create an antagonistic mood between overseas Chinese and their motherland. Even subscribing to the "China Daily News" in New York risks being put on a "blacklist."
    From just a few lines in my classmate's letter, it is clear that the U.S. government is not earnestly implementing the agreement reached between China and the United States in Geneva on assisting the return of nationals of both sides to their countries, but is obstructing and undermining it. The so-called "democracy" and "humanitarian principles" that the U.S. government keeps talking about are actually like this! We must protest against the U.S. government's shameless threats and deceptive acts against overseas Chinese, which violate humanitarian principles and the Sino-U.S. talks agreement!
    Despite the U.S. government's many rogue tactics against overseas Chinese in the United States, it has no way to extinguish the love of overseas Chinese for their great motherland. My classmate said in her letter: "I love my motherland more than I love my country of residence," "I really regret my foolishness in coming to the United States, and material enjoyment cannot compensate for the distress in my heart!" She said, "It is of course a happy thing that Egypt has recognized China recently." She hopes that the United States will also recognize China and "hopes that the People's Government can join the United Nations as soon as possible."
    We believe that overseas Chinese with a glorious patriotic tradition are an inseparable part of the motherland's family, and their desire to love their motherland cannot be shaken by any means used by the U.S. government.

### 抗议美国政府对华侨的威胁恐吓

专栏：读者来信

    抗议美国政府对华侨的威胁恐吓编辑同志：
    这几个月来，我陆续收到一位侨居美国的老同学的来信，信内谈到了我国旅美侨胞的处境的一些情况。
    她在今年3月15日的一封信中说：“近来三藩市（按：即旧金山）侨胞的生活非常不安定，为的是美政府派人查问侨团（华侨团体）、索名单，如果发现一个人有两个名字之时，就有坐牢之可能。”在6月1日的一封信上，她谈到了纽约的情形：“在这个时候留美华侨最惨，你可以想像得到……，尤其是近来审查侨团之事，整个华侨社会呈现着一种消沉之气氛，很少人往华埠去了（按：华埠是指中国侨胞聚居地方），因为在街上审问之故。”
    来信中也谈到，美国政府对我国旅美华侨除了使用这些威胁手段之外，还通过各种各式的宣传机构向华侨进行欺骗恐吓。例如，说什么在中国国内“不准人民有收音机”、“数日配一次粮”、“回大陆后不准出香港”等等，千方百计地阻挠华侨回国，企图制造侨胞和祖国对立的情绪。旅美华侨甚至订阅纽约的“华侨日报”，也有被列入“黑名单”上的危险。
    从我这位同学来信的短短几行字中就很明白地看出了对于中美两国在日内瓦会谈中达成的协助双方侨民回国问题的协议，美国政府不是在切实执行，而是在进行阻挠、破坏。美国政府口口声声说个不停的所谓“民主”和“人道原则”，原来就是这么一回事！我们要抗议美国政府对华侨所采取的这种违背人道原则和中美会谈协议的无耻的威胁和欺骗行为！
    尽管美国政府对旅美华侨耍了很多无赖手段，可是它没有任何办法可以扑灭华侨对伟大祖国的热爱。我这位同学来信说：“我爱祖国多于爱居留国”，“我真有点怨恨自己的傻气跑到美国来，而物质的享受抵偿不了心灵里的苦闷！”她说：“最近埃及承认中国了，当然是高兴的事。”她希望美国也承认中国，“希望人民政府能早些入联合国”。
    我们相信：有着光荣的爱国传统的华侨，是祖国大家庭中不可分割的一部分成员，他们热爱祖国的愿望，是美国政府使用任何手段也动摇不了的。　广州市  黄炳信
