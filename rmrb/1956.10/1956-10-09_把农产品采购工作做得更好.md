Do a Better Job of Purchasing Agricultural Products
Yang Yichen, Minister of Agricultural Product Procurement

    Fully Utilize Agricultural Product Resources

    China is a vast country with abundant resources, and agricultural products are very rich. If many unutilized agricultural product resources are utilized, it can provide many avenues for developing rural sideline occupations, thereby increasing farmers' income and social wealth. Just taking a few categories of varieties operated by the agricultural product procurement department as an example: there are more than 40 kinds of substitutes for hemp in the country that have not been fully utilized. Among them, the cotton stalk bark fiber that can be stripped nationwide this year will reach 9.2 million dan, which is 30% more than the output of jute. According to preliminary tests, it can be used for papermaking, weaving bag cloth, weaving sacks, making hemp ropes, wrapping cables, etc. The tensile strength of cotton stalk bark fiber is not as good as jute, but its alkali and acid resistance is stronger than jute. It is most suitable to use sacks mixed with cotton stalk bark fiber to pack edible salt and fertilizer. If half of the cotton stalk bark fiber produced this year is utilized, farmers can increase their income by more than 160 million yuan, and it can also replace a large amount of cotton and hemp. It is just that the cost of cotton stalk bark fiber is currently about 38 yuan per dan, which is more than 3 yuan higher than the price of third-class jute, and it is necessary to further study and improve the stripping and degumming methods to gradually reduce costs. In livestock products, exporting one ton of cashmere can obtain foreign exchange equivalent to exporting 244 tons of soybeans. There are about 30 million goats in the country that can be combed for cashmere. Calculated at 5 liang of cashmere per goat, a total of more than 9 million jin of cashmere can be produced, but the purchase quantity this year is more than 5 million jin, and nearly half of the cashmere has not been combed. At present, the purchase quantity of sheep wool in the country cannot meet the needs of export and industrial production, while miscellaneous hair from cattle, horses, mules, donkeys, etc. is estimated to produce 15,000 tons annually nationwide, but only more than 200 tons are purchased now, accounting for only 1.3% of the output. If these miscellaneous hairs are utilized, it can not only increase farmers' income but also replace sheep wool to supply export and industrial production needs. There are also many highly profitable agricultural and animal husbandry products that have not been fully utilized and developed. For example, the income from raising improved breed rabbits is very large. A pair of breeding rabbits can reproduce 70 rabbits a year. The Qianjin No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative in Wugong County, Shaanxi Province, raised 50 improved breed rabbits, and the income from selling young rabbits and rabbit hair throughout the year reached 2,500 yuan. For example, in Anhui Province, raising 1,000 ducks, the annual income is equivalent to the income of 25 mu of "thousand-jin rice" paddy fields. You can also get 24,000 jin of duck manure, which can fertilize more than 70 mu of land. In Yuncheng County, Shandong Province, raising ten goats that can produce blue fox skins can generate an income of more than 90 yuan a year just from selling blue fox skins. In addition, for agricultural products suitable for preliminary processing by agricultural cooperatives or members' family sideline occupations, such as cotton, jute, and pig bristles, the agricultural cooperatives and members can be guided to process them partially or entirely according to needs and possibilities. According to preliminary calculations, farmers can increase their income by more than 70 million yuan from the preliminary processing of the above-mentioned agricultural products.

    The above are just a few examples, and there are many similar production projects. In the short term, as long as the above-mentioned production projects are developed and utilized, it can increase farmers' income by about 300 million yuan each year. Moreover, these production projects generally do not require major labor, do not occupy cultivated land, have low costs, have quick turnover, and are easy to organize production.

    In order to fully utilize agricultural and sideline product resources, first of all, procurement departments must strengthen the investigation and research on agricultural and sideline products and publicity and education for farmers, strengthen technical guidance, promote advanced experience, and actively purchase. At the same time, relevant departments need to cooperate closely, scientific research departments and industrial departments should strengthen the research and experimentation and trial adoption of agricultural products, and trade departments should organize sales. It is certain that as long as everyone takes action and brings into play the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers, it is entirely possible to fully develop and utilize more agricultural and sideline products.

    Improve the Pre-purchase Work of Agricultural Products

    In the past few years, the state's pre-purchase of agricultural products was limited to a few varieties such as cotton. This spring, pre-purchases were made for cotton, tea, silkworm cocoons, ramie, flue-cured tobacco, and wool. Subsequently, pre-purchases of autumn grain were added, and the state issued more than 1.2 billion yuan in pre-purchase deposits to farmers. Farmers generally responded well to the phased issuance of pre-purchase deposits during the production season, considering it "timely good rain" and "sending charcoal in the snow," which helped farmers solve the needs of production funds and living expenses, which is conducive to promoting and consolidating agricultural cooperatives, and can connect the production plans of agricultural cooperatives with national plans, which not only meets the production requirements of farmers but also ensures the source of agricultural products needed by the state, and is also conducive to the balance of currency issuance and commodity sales in each quarter of the year. This year, there are still many shortcomings in our pre-purchase work: after agricultural cooperation, we still only emphasize the use of pre-purchase deposits for production, and have not stipulated that an appropriate proportion should be allocated to members as living expenses, so that most agricultural cooperatives use about 80% of the pre-purchase funds for production investment. Although this has played a certain role in helping newly established agricultural cooperatives solve the difficulties of production investment, it has not given appropriate consideration to the living difficulties of farmers, and the masses are not satisfied enough. The preferential supply of materials has not been fully realized. The preparatory work, organization, and publicity work for pre-purchase were also poorly done. Only the timing of pre-purchasing cotton was relatively timely, and other varieties were delayed. The pre-purchase procedures were also not complete enough, and a few agricultural cooperatives also had false reports and fraudulent claims. Some areas discriminated against individual farmers and withheld their deposits. These problems were only partially corrected in the review of pre-purchase contracts, and should be taken as lessons in the future.

    I believe that in the future for a long period of time, purchasing agricultural products through pre-purchase can become an important procurement system of the state. The varieties and regions for pre-purchase should also be appropriately expanded in the future. Except for commodities that are difficult to ascertain the output and are scattered, such as duck feathers and miscellaneous skins, general cash crops and major livestock products can be pre-purchased. The timing of pre-purchase should be before the production season. The proportion of pre-purchase deposits can also be considered to be gradually and appropriately increased in the future. The issuance of deposits can be issued in two or three installments according to the needs of agricultural cooperatives for production topdressing and members' advance living expenses. The content of the pre-purchase contract, such as the preferential supply of materials, should be implemented in accordance with the principle of seeking truth from facts. What can be done or can be done after effort can be included in the contract; what cannot be done should not be included. When farmers deliver agricultural products, the pre-purchase deposit must be recovered on time in order to establish the credit of the pre-purchase contract and consolidate the pre-purchase system.

    Improve the Grade Inspection of Agricultural Products

    At present, the grade inspection of agricultural products by agricultural product procurement departments is not completely accurate. According to inspection, the grade inspection of flue-cured tobacco in some areas is as follows: only about 80% of the total purchase volume is graded accurately, and 20% is graded too high, too low, or the grades are confused. In the deviation of grade inspection, the situation of suppressing grades and prices is more common. Farmers in Henan reflected: "The state purchases hemp, and the price is the same regardless of quality, only measuring length and ignoring quality differences." After agricultural cooperation, the quantity of agricultural products sold by agricultural cooperatives is large and concentrated. If the grade inspection is inaccurate, it will have a greater impact on the interests of the state and agricultural cooperatives. Taking cotton as an example, if the grade is inspected incorrectly by one grade, it will increase the state's expenditure or reduce farmers' income by 150 million yuan.

    In order to improve the work of inspecting the grade of agricultural products, I believe that: First, we must strengthen the policy education of procurement personnel and the technical training of inspection personnel, implement the principle of pricing according to quality in the work, and must not raise grades and prices, let alone suppress grades and prices. Second, the state must have a unified and reasonable regulation for the grade standards of agricultural products. It is best for the state to establish a unified commodity inspection agency to avoid losses to the state or farmers and disputes between departments. Third, the grades should not be too many, so as to facilitate the masses to master and supervise (recently, the Soviet Union reduced the acceptance of cotton from six grades to four grades, and China's cotton is divided into twelve grades). Fourth, gradually achieve the replacement of sensory inspection with instrument inspection. Fifth, we must strengthen mass supervision of inspection work and adopt the mass line method in inspection work. Publicize the quality standards and grade price differences stipulated by the state to the masses, for example, exhibit samples of various grades, issue various pictures, and mark the prices of various grades separately. The procurement department can also help agricultural cooperatives train grade inspection personnel, and gradually enable the masses of farmers to understand the state's requirements for commodity quality and master the technology of grading and inspection. In this way, agricultural cooperatives can classify, stack, and sort products before selling them. During procurement, procurement stations can also absorb experienced agricultural cooperative members to participate in the inspection and negotiate the grade. Adopting these methods can not only more accurately inspect commodity grades, but also improve farmers' technology for agricultural product production, processing, and grading and sorting, which is conducive to improving the quality of agricultural products. Sixth, the leading organs of the procurement department should organize forces to strengthen the inspection of grade inspection work, promptly exchange experience and correct deviations, especially the deviations of suppressing grades and prices.

    The work of stipulating grade standards and inspecting grades are very important policy issues, and I hope that party committees at all levels will strictly supervise the procurement department.

    The success or failure of agricultural product procurement work is closely related to the interests of more than 500 million farmers and the country's socialist construction. I hope that party committees at all levels will further strengthen leadership so that agricultural product procurement work can better serve socialist construction.

### 把农产品采购工作做得更好

　　把农产品采购工作做得更好
　　农产品采购部部长　杨一辰
    充分利用农产品资源
    我国地大物博，农产品非常丰富。如果将许多尚未利用的农产品资源加以利用，可以提供许多发展农村副业的门路，从而增加农民的收入和社会的财富。现只就农产品采购部所经营的几类品种来说：全国现有四十多种麻类的代用品还没有充分利用起来。其中今年全国可以剥制的棉秆皮纤维即达九百二十万担，比黄麻的产量还多百分之三十。根据初步试验可以用于造纸、织包布、织麻袋、打麻绳、包电缆等。棉秆皮纤维的拉力不如黄麻，但耐碱、耐酸的能力却比黄麻强。用掺有棉秆皮纤维的麻袋包装食盐和肥田粉最为适宜。如果把今年生产的半数棉秆皮纤维利用起来，农民即可增加收入一亿六千多万元，还可以代替大量的棉和麻。只是棉秆皮纤维的成本目前每担约三十八元左右，比三等黄麻的价格还高三元多，需要进一步研究改进剥制和脱胶的方法，逐步降低成本。在畜产品中，出口一吨山羊绒，可以得到相当于出口二百四十四吨大豆的外汇，全国可以抓绒的山羊约有三千多万头，按每头山羊产绒五两计算，共可产绒九百多万斤，但是今年的收购数量为五百多万斤，还有将近一半的羊绒没有抓下来。目前全国绵羊毛的收购数量还不能满足出口和工业生产的需要，而牛、马、骡、驴等杂毛估计全国每年可产一万五千吨，现在只收购二百多吨，只占产量的百分之一点三。如果将这些杂毛利用起来，不但可以增加农民收入，而且可以顶替羊毛来供应出口和工业生产的需要。还有许多收益很大的农牧产品，也没有充分利用和发展。比如，养改良种兔子的收入就很大，一对种兔一年可以繁殖七十只，陕西省武功县前进第一农业社养了五十只改良种兔子，全年所卖幼兔及兔毛的收入即达二千五百元。又如，在安徽省养一千只鸭，一年的收入，跟二十五亩“千斤稻”稻田的收入相等。还可以得到鸭粪二万四千斤，能够肥田七十多亩。山东省郓城县养十只可产青猾皮的山羊，单是出卖青猾皮的收入，一年即可达九十多元。此外，凡适合于农业社或社员家庭副业进行初制加工的农产品，例如棉花、黄麻、猪鬃等，都可以根据需要和可能，部分地或者全部地指导农业社和社员去进行加工。根据初步计算，上述几项农产品的初制加工，农民可以增加七千多万元的收入。
    上面所举的只不过是少数例子，类似的生产项目还很多。在短期之内只要把上述几项生产发展和利用起来，大约可使农民每年增加收入三亿多元。而且这些生产项目，一般都不需要主要劳动力，不占耕地，成本低，周转快，易于组织生产。
    为了充分利用农副产品资源，首先，采购部门要加强对农副产品的调查研究和对农民的宣传教育，加强技术指导，推广先进经验，积极采购。同时，需要各有关部门密切协作，科学研究部门和工业部门加强对农产品的研究试验与试用采用，贸易部门组织推销。可以肯定，只要大家动手，发挥广大农民群众的积极性，将更多的农副产品充分地发展和利用起来是完全可能的。
    改进农产品预购工作
    过去几年，国家预购农产品只限于棉花等少数品种，今年春季对于棉花、茶叶、蚕茧、苎麻、烤烟、羊毛等都进行了预购，随后，又增加了秋粮的预购，国家发给农民的预购定金共十二亿余元。在生产季节分期发放预购定金，农民普遍反映很好，认为是“及时好雨”、“雪里送炭”，帮助农民解决了生产资金和生活费用的需要，有利于促进和巩固农业合作制，并且可以使农业社的生产计划与国家计划相衔接，既满足了农民的生产要求，又使国家需要的农产品货源有了保证，还有利于全年各个季度货币投放与商品销售的均衡。今年我们的预购工作还存在不少的缺点：在农业合作化以后，我们仍然只强调将预购定金用于生产方面，对于提出适当的比例分配给社员作为生活开支，没有加以规定，以致多数农业社将预购款的百分之八十左右用于生产投资。这对帮助新成立的农业社解决生产投资的困难，虽然起了一定作用，但对于农民的生活困难，没有给予适当的照顾，群众是不够满意的。优待供应的物资也没有完全兑现。预购的准备工作和组织、宣传工作，做得也比较差。只有预购棉花的时间比较及时，其他品种都晚了一些。预购的手续也不够完备，少数农业社还有虚报、冒领的现象。有些地区歧视单干农民，扣留他们的定金。这些问题，在预购合同的复查中，才进行了一些纠正，今后应当引为经验教训。
    我认为，在今后的一个长时期内，通过预购来采购农产品，可以成为国家的一种重要的采购制度。预购的品种和地区，今后还应当适当地扩大，除去产量
  难于摸清的和零星分散的商品如鸭毛、杂皮等不进行预购外，一般的经济作物和主要畜产品都可以预购。预购的时间应当在生产季节之前。预购定金的比例，今后还可考虑逐渐的适当的增加。定金的发放，可以根据农业社生产追肥和社员预支生活费用的需要，分两次或三次发放。对于预购合同的内容，如优待供应的物资等，应该贯彻实事求是的原则。能办到的或者经过努力之后能够办到的，就可以列入合同；办不到的就不列入。在农民交售农产品的时候，必须将预购定金按时收回，以树立预购合同的信用和巩固预购制度。
    改进农产品的等级检验
    目前农产品采购部门对于农产品的等级检验是不完全准确的。据检查，有的地区对于烤烟的验级情况是：评级准确的只占采购总量的百分之八十左右，偏高、偏低和等级混乱的占百分之二十，在验级的偏差中，尤以压级压价的情况较多。河南的农民反映：
  “国家收购麻，好坏一样价，只量长和短，不管质量差”。农业合作化以后，农业社出售的农产品量大而集中，如果验级不准，对于国家和农业社的利益，就会有更大的影响。单以棉花一项而论，如果验错一级，就会使国家增多支出或者使农民减少收入一点五亿元。
    为了改进检验农产品等级的工作，我认为：首先，必须加强采购人员的政策教育和检验人员的技术训练，在工作中贯彻按质论价的原则，不得提级提价，更不得压级压价。第二、国家对于农产品的等级标准，必须有一个统一的合理的规定。最好国家能成立统一的商品检验机构，免使国家或农民遭受损失和部门之间扯皮。第三、等级不要规定得太多，以便于群众掌握和监督（最近苏联验收棉花从六个等级减少为四个等级，我国的棉花共分十二个等级）。第四、逐步做到用仪器检验代替感官检验。第五、必须加强对于检验工作的群众监督，在检验工作中，采取群众路线的方法。将国家规定的品质标准和等级差价向群众广为宣传，比如，展览各种等级的样品，印发各种图画，并且分别标明各种等级的价格。还可以由采购部门帮助农业社训练验级人员，逐步使农民群众懂得国家对商品质量的要求和掌握分等验级的技术。这样，农业社在出售前，就可以将产品分类归堆和分级整理。在收购的时候，采购站也可以吸收有经验的农业社社员参加检验，协商定级。采取这些方法，不仅可以比较准确地检验商品等级，而且可以改进农民对于农产品生产加工和分级整理的技术，有利于提高农产品的质量。第六、采购部门的领导机关应该组织力量，加强对验级工作的检查，及时地交流经验和纠正偏差，特别是压级压价的偏差。
    规定等级标准和检验等级的工作都是很重要的政策问题，希望各级党委对于采购部门严格地加以监督。
    农产品采购工作做的好坏，同五亿多农民的利益和国家社会主义建设有着密切关系，希望各级党委进一步地加强领导，以使农产品采购工作更好地为社会主义建设服务。
