Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 24th. As the construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway progresses, a thriving construction scene is emerging along the line. Traveling west by train on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, one can see a cluster of huge buildings, some with scaffolding still not completely removed, in the wilderness of Yongdeng County. A large cement factory with an annual output of hundreds of thousands of tons is being built here. On the Wushaoling Mountains, 3,000 meters above sea level, a new city inhabited by the Tibetan people is being built.

The trains entering the Hexi Corridor are transporting huge machines and a lot of building materials to the new factories and cities. The Shandan Coalfield is being built into a modern coal mine. The new power plant on the coalfield has begun installing machinery and equipment, and several pairs of modern mine shafts are being built at an accelerated pace. Wuwei, Zhangye, and Jiuquan will all be built into modern cities, and many factories and schools have already begun construction.

On the Gobi Desert, more than 20 kilometers outside Jiayuguan, a new town is being built. In a place where wild sheep used to frolic and play a few months ago, scaffolding for construction projects has been erected, and trains coming and going unload hundreds of tons of bricks, tiles, steel, wood, and cement every day. A total of 40,000 square meters of residential buildings, schools, hotels, factory buildings, and offices will be built in the new town.

    新城市、新工厂、新学校不断出现
    兰新路沿线一片建设景象
    据新华社兰州24日电　随着兰新铁路修筑工程的不断前进，沿线出现了一片繁荣的建设景象。坐着兰新铁路上的火车向西去，在永登县境的荒野上；可以看到一片还未全部拆掉脚手架的巨大建筑群，这里正在兴建一座年产几十万吨的大型水泥厂。拔海三千公尺的乌鞘岭上，正在建设一座藏族人民聚居的新城市。
    进入河西走廊的火车，给新建工厂、城市运来了巨大的机器和很多建筑材料。山丹煤田正在建设成为一座现代化煤矿，煤田上的新电厂开始安装机器设备，几对现代化的矿井正在加紧建设。武威、张掖和酒泉都将要建设成为现代化的城市，许多工厂和学校已经开始建设。
    嘉峪关外二十多公里的戈壁滩上，正在建设一座新型市镇。在几个月前还是野羊奔逐嬉戏的地方，建筑工程用的脚手架矗立起来了，来往奔驶的火车每天要在这里卸下成百吨的砖瓦、钢材、木料和水泥。新市镇里共要建设四万平方公尺建筑面积的住宅、学校、旅馆、工厂厂房和办公室。
