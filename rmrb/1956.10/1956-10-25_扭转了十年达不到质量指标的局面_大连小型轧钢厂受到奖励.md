Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, October 23rd – The workers of the Dalian Small Steel Rolling Mill have saved more than 110 tons of steel since January this year. The factory's product scrap rate has also been reduced from the original 0.18% to 0.04%, 0.12% lower than the national required target.

From 1946 to the end of last year, this factory's product quality had never met the national standards. Since the beginning of this year, the factory's workers have improved the pass design standards of the rolling mill, ensuring that various types of steel do not crack. They also organized some highly skilled inspection workers to conduct inspections in workshops with high scrap rates to identify and solve problems in a timely manner. Since August, the workers have launched a competition for scrap-free workdays, with four production teams basically eliminating scrap during the competition. Among them, the Xia Guangquan team in the first section used to have a lot of scrap and low quality, but now it has become an advanced team in the factory for eliminating scrap.

Because the workers of this factory have saved a large amount of steel and reversed the situation of failing to meet national quality targets for ten years, the Lüda Municipal Industrial Bureau recently gave them material rewards.

    扭转了十年达不到质量指标的局面
    大连小型轧钢厂受到奖励
    新华社旅大23日电　大连小型轧钢厂的职工，从今年1月以来已经节约了一百一十多吨钢材；全厂的产品废品率也由原来的0.18％降低到0.04％，比国家要求指标降低了0.12％。
    这个工厂从1946年起到去年年末，产品质量一直没有达到国家规定的指标。今年以来，这个工厂的职工改进了轧钢机的孔型标准，保证了各种钢材不出裂纹，并且组织了一些技术高的检查工人到废品多的车间去进行检查，及时发现问题，解决问题。8月份以来，职工们又开展了不出废品工作日的竞赛，有四个生产小组在竞赛中基本上消灭了废品。其中的第一工段夏广泉小组过去总是废品多，质量不高，现在成了工厂消灭废品的先进小组。
    这个厂由于职工们节约了大量钢材，并且扭转了十年来达不到国家质量指标的局面，最近得到了旅大市工业局的物质奖励。
