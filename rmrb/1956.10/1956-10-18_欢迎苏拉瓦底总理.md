    Welcome Prime Minister Suhrawardy
    Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy is scheduled to arrive in Beijing today for a friendly visit to our country at our invitation. The people of our country extend a warm welcome to the distinguished guest from afar, and believe that this is an important sign of the further development of friendly relations between our country and Pakistan.
    China and Pakistan are neighbors. Our two countries have many things in common. As early as the fifth century AD, there were frequent exchanges between the people of China and Pakistan. For more than a thousand years thereafter, the people of the two countries have maintained friendly relations. In terms of religion, culture, and art, our two countries have learned a lot from each other, enriching the inherent civilizations of the two countries. In modern times, China and Pakistan have both suffered from colonialist oppression, and have sympathized with and supported each other in the struggle against colonialism. Especially in recent years, both of our countries have achieved independence, and the people of both countries have a strong common desire to oppose colonialism, get rid of economic backwardness, and strive for a peaceful international environment to build their own country. These facts not only constitute the basis for peaceful cooperation and friendly coexistence between our two countries, but also provide broad possibilities for the two countries to develop economic cooperation and cultural exchanges.
    Since the official establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Pakistan, economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries has continued to develop, and the friendship between the people of the two countries has continued to increase. In particular, the frank and sincere contact between the Prime Ministers of the two countries during the Asian-African Conference greatly enhanced mutual understanding and friendship. After the Asian-African Conference, trade relations between the two countries developed rapidly. The trade volume between the two countries in 1954 increased by 170% compared with 1953, and by 39% in 1955 compared with 1954. This year, China and Pakistan signed new trade contracts and agreements, and trade relations between the two countries have been further developed. Friendly contacts between the governments and peoples of the two countries have also become more frequent than before. In the first half of this year alone, Vice Chairman Song Qingling of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of our country and Vice Premier He Long of the State Council of our country were invited to visit Pakistan one after another, and were warmly welcomed and received by the Pakistani government and people, which fully reflects the deep friendship between the people of our two countries.
    Prime Minister Suhrawardy's visit to our country at our invitation is another major event in the development of friendly relations between China and Pakistan. The countless facts of the continuous development of friendly relations between China and Pakistan and other countries show that mutual visits and contacts between leaders of governments of various countries are one of the important factors in enhancing mutual understanding and friendship. Therefore, we firmly believe that Prime Minister Suhrawardy's visit to our country, through direct contact between the leaders of the two governments, will effectively promote the further development and strengthening of friendly relations between China and Pakistan. This will undoubtedly be very beneficial to the common prosperity of the two countries and to the consolidation of lasting peace in Asia.
    The Chinese people are pleased to note that the Pakistani government has recently repeatedly expressed its good desire to continue to work to promote peace and friendly cooperation. Prime Minister Suhrawardy clearly stated on September 12, when the new government of Pakistan was established: the world is moving towards peace, Pakistan urgently hopes to be friendly with all countries, and will try to win everyone's cooperation and do everything possible to maintain peace. The Pakistani government has recently made many efforts to improve relations with socialist countries and other countries. Pakistan has increased equal and mutually beneficial trade with many countries, and friendly exchanges with various countries are also developing. At the same time, the Pakistani government has recently changed its past views on the Suez Canal issue. It refused to participate in the so-called "Users' Association" that Western countries attempted to use to infringe upon Egyptian sovereignty, believing that Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal should be respected, and advocated that the Suez Canal issue should be resolved through peaceful negotiation. This has received a very good response among countries around the world. These statements by the Pakistani government embody the Pakistani people's desire for peace and friendship and opposition to Western colonialism, which is undoubtedly conducive to the independent economic development of Pakistan and the cause of peace in Asia.
    The government and people of our country are willing to strengthen the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Pakistan in accordance with the Five

    欢迎苏拉瓦底总理
    巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底应邀前来我国进行友好访问，定于今日到达北京。我国人民对于远道而来的贵宾，表示热烈的欢迎，并认为这是我国同巴基斯坦友好关系进一步发展的重要标志。
    我国同巴基斯坦是邻邦。我们两国有着许多共同点。早在公元五世纪的时候，中巴两国人民之间就开始有了频繁的往来。在以后的一千多年间，两国人民一直保持着友好的关系。在宗教、文化、艺术各方面，我们两国互相学习了许多东西，丰富了两国各自固有的文明。在近代，中巴两国同样遭受殖民主义的压迫，并在反抗殖民主义的斗争中互相同情和支持。特别是近几年来，我们两国都取得了独立，两国人民都具有强烈的反对殖民主义、摆脱经济落后、争取一个和平的国际环境来建设自己祖国的共同愿望。这些事实，不但构成了我们两国和平合作和友好相处的基础，并且提供了两国发展经济合作和文化交流的广泛的可能性。
    我国同巴基斯坦自从正式建立外交关系以来，两国之间的经济、文化合作就不断发展，两国人民之间的友谊就不断增进。尤其是在亚非会议期间，两国总理的坦白和诚恳的接触，大大增进了相互的了解和友谊。在亚非会议以后，两国的贸易关系有了迅速的发展。1954年两国的贸易额比1953年增加了170％，1955年比1954年又增加了39％。今年，我国同巴基斯坦签订了新的贸易合同和协定，两国之间的贸易关系又有了新的发展。两国政府和人民之间友好接触，也较前更加频繁了。仅在今年上半年，我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会宋庆龄副委员长和我国国务院贺龙副总理，都先后应邀访问了巴基斯坦，受到巴基斯坦政府和全国人民的热烈欢迎和接待，这充分反映了我们两国人民之间的深厚友谊。
    苏拉瓦底总理这次应邀访问我国，是中巴两国友好关系向前发展中的又一件大事。我国同巴基斯坦以及其他国家友好关系不断发展的无数事实说明，各国政府领导人的互相访问和接触，是增进彼此了解和友谊的重要因素之一。因此，我们深信，苏拉瓦底总理访问我国，通过两国政府领导人的亲自接触，必将有效地促进中巴两国友好关系的进一步发展和加强。这无疑对于两国的共同繁荣、对于巩固亚洲的持久和平都是十分有益的。
    中国人民欣喜地注意到，巴基斯坦政府最近一再表示要为促进和平和友好合作而继续努力的良好愿望。苏拉瓦底总理9月12日在巴基斯坦新政府成立的时候就曾明确地表示：世界正在朝着和平前进，巴基斯坦迫切希望同一切国家友好，并将设法争取大家的合作，将尽一切力量来维持和平。巴基斯坦政府最近在改进同社会主义国家和其他国家的关系方面，已经作了许多努力。巴基斯坦同许多国家增进了平等互利的贸易往来，同各国的友好往来也在发展。同时，巴基斯坦政府最近在苏伊士运河问题上，已改变了它过去的观点。它拒绝参加西方国家企图用以侵犯埃及主权的所谓“使用国协会”，认为埃及对苏伊士运河的主权应被尊重，主张苏伊士运河问题应该和平协商解决。这在世界各国间得到了非常良好的反响。巴基斯坦政府的这些表示，体现了巴基斯坦人民要求和平友好和反对西方殖民主义的愿望，这无疑是有利于巴基斯坦经济的独立发展和亚洲的和平事业的。
    我国政府和人民愿意根据和平共处五项原则和亚非会议所一致协议的十项原则，加强中国同巴基斯坦的友好合作关系。我国向来认为，一切国家，不论国家大小、思想信仰有何不同，都应该和平共处，友好合作。我们特别重视加强同自己邻邦的友好合作。我们深信，中国同巴基斯坦友好合作的道路是宽广的，我们两国的友谊将不断得到发展！
