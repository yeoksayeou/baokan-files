    The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided to establish a third steel industrial base in Siberia within the next fifteen to twenty years. The annual pig iron production of this base is expected to reach 15 million to 20 million tons. This means it will exceed the production of Britain, France, or West Germany. Clearly, the establishment of this base will not only greatly promote the development of the Soviet steel industry but will also completely change the face of Siberia.
    Siberia has vast land and abundant resources, with iron ore reserves of more than two billion tons. The region originally had only one large steel plant, the Kuznetsk Integrated Iron and Steel Works in Stalinsk.
    The construction of the third steel industrial base has now begun. The first step is to build a huge steel plant in the Kuzbass region, with a production capacity exceeding the existing Kuznetsk Integrated Iron and Steel Works. Two steel plants will be established in the Krasnoyarsk Krai and the Irkutsk Oblast. In addition, powerful electric furnace workshops and rolling workshops will be added to the Kuznetsk Integrated Iron and Steel Works.
    The establishment of this base can utilize the incredibly rich resources of Siberia to produce steel, serving the industrialization of the region. It can greatly develop machine manufacturing and other industries with its own steel. According to the provisions of the Soviet Sixth Five-Year Plan, as many as sixty-five machine-building factories are to be built in Siberia!
    Besides Siberia, where are the other two steel industrial bases in the Soviet Union?
    The steel plants in the Donbas, Dnieper River area, and Azov Sea coast of the Ukrainian Republic are the oldest southern metallurgical centers in the Soviet Union. This area has abundant coal from the Donbas and the nationally renowned Krivoy Rog iron ore deposit, which provides particularly favorable conditions for the development of the metallurgical industry. In the Tsarist era, the country relied almost entirely on pig iron from this area. At that time, the region's pig iron production accounted for three-quarters of Russia's total production. After the establishment of the Soviet regime, old factories were renovated and new factories, such as the Zaporozhye Steel Plant and the Azov Steel Factory, were built during several Five-Year Plans. Steel production developed vigorously. Now, the base accounts for 38% of the country's total steel production and 49% of its pig iron production.
    With the development of national industrialization, the Soviet Union could not rely solely on the southern base. Therefore, in May 1930, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union passed a resolution on the development of the Urals plan, deciding to establish the second coal mining and metallurgical base in the Soviet Union. Specifically, it was to establish a joint enterprise in the Urals-Kuznetsk region, combining the coal of Kuznetsk in Western Siberia with the iron of the Urals. This plan was realized. On the one hand, the Kuznetsk Integrated Iron and Steel Works mentioned earlier was built. On the other hand, the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works was built in the southern Urals. Its first blast furnace began producing iron in 1932. Subsequently, new factories emerged one after another, and a vast new steel industrial area was gradually established in the wilderness of the Urals, with huge steel plants distributed in cities such as Magnitogorsk, Nizhny Tagil, and Chelyabinsk.
    The steel industry in the Urals developed rapidly. In the first three years of the Soviet Third Five-Year Plan, its pig iron and steel production had almost reached one-fifth of the Soviet Union's total production. During the Soviet Patriotic War, many shells fired at the German army were made of steel from the Urals. The Urals became a powerful arsenal of the Soviet Union at that time, producing 40% of the country's military industrial products. The Urals metallurgical base played a significant role in the Soviet Union's national industrialization and the Patriotic War.
    The Soviet steel industry is developing rapidly, and steel production is increasing year by year. In 1955, the Soviet Union produced more than 45 million tons of steel, which is almost equal to the total steel production of the three important capitalist countries of Britain, West Germany, and Italy. According to the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union's steel production will reach 68.3 million tons and pig iron will reach 53 million tons in 1960. We can imagine the enormous role the establishment of the new third steel industrial base will play in the further development of the Soviet steel industry and the construction of communism.

    苏联的三个钢铁工业基地
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会决定，要在今后十五年到二十年之间在西伯利亚地区建立第三个钢铁工业基地。这个基地的生铁年产量要达到一千五百万吨到两千万吨。这就是说，比英国、法国或西德的产量还要多。显然，这个基地的建立，不但会大大促进苏联钢铁工业的发展，也会使西伯利亚的面貌完全改观。
    西伯利亚土地辽阔，资源丰富，铁矿蕴藏量有二十亿吨以上。这个地区原来只有一个巨大的钢铁厂，这就是斯大林斯克的库兹涅茨克联合钢铁厂。
    第三个钢铁工业基地的建设工作，现在已经开始了。首先要在库兹巴斯地区建设一个巨大的钢铁厂，它的生产能力要超过这里原有的库兹涅茨克联合钢铁厂。在克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区和伊尔库次克州要建立两个钢铁厂。此外，在库兹涅茨克联合钢铁厂也要增建强大的电炉车间和轧钢车间。
    建立这个基地，可以利用西伯利亚地区丰富无比的资源，炼出钢铁，来为这个地区的工业化服务。它可以用自己的钢铁大大发展机器制造业和其他工业。根据苏联第六个五年计划的规定，要在西伯利亚地区建设的机器制造工厂就有六十五个之多！
    除了西伯利亚地区外，苏联其他两个钢铁工业基地又在哪儿呢？
    乌克兰共和国的顿巴斯、第聂伯河沿岸一带和亚速海沿岸的钢铁厂，是苏联最老的南方冶金业中心。这里有顿巴斯的丰富的煤，有全国著名的克里沃罗格铁矿产地，这就为冶金业的发展提供了特别优越的条件。沙皇时代，全国差不多完全依靠着这儿的生铁。那时，这个地区的生铁产量占全俄产量的四分之三。苏维埃政权建立以后，在几个五年计划期间改建了旧厂子，又新建了像萨坡罗什炼钢厂和亚速钢铁工厂这样的大工厂。钢铁生产蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。现在，这个基地的钢产量在苏联全国占38％，生铁产量占全国49％。
    随着国家工业化的发展，苏联不能仅仅依靠南方这一个基地，于是在1930年5月苏共中央通过了关于发展乌拉尔计划的决议，决定建立苏联的第二个采煤冶金基地。具体地就是建立乌拉尔—库兹涅茨克两地区的联合企业，使西部西伯利亚的库兹涅茨克的煤和乌拉尔的铁结合起来。这个计划实现了，一方面建起了我们前面提到过的库兹涅茨克联合钢铁厂，一方面在乌拉尔南部建成了马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁厂，它的第一号高炉也是在1932年开始出铁的，随后，新工厂陆续出现，一个广大的新钢铁工业区在乌拉尔的旷野中逐步建立起来，巨大的钢铁厂分布在马格尼托哥尔斯克，下塔吉尔和车里雅宾斯克等城市。
    乌拉尔的钢铁工业迅速发展起来。在苏联第三个五年计划的前三年，它的生铁和钢产量已经差不多达到苏联全国产量的五分之一了，在苏联卫国战争时期，向德军发放的许多炮弹，都是由乌拉尔的钢制造的。乌拉尔当时变成了苏联强大的兵工厂，它生产的军事工业品占全国40％。乌拉尔这个冶金业基地对苏联的国家工业化和卫国战争都起了很大的作用。
    苏联的钢铁工业在迅速发展，钢铁的产量一年年增加，1955年苏联生产了四千五百多万吨钢，这个数目几乎等于英国、西德、意大利三个重要资本主义国家钢产量的总和，按照第六个五年计划，1960年苏联的钢产量将达到六千八百三十万吨，生铁将达到五千三百万吨。我们可以想像得到，新的第三个钢铁工业基地的建立，对苏联钢铁工业的进一步发展和共产主义建设会起怎样巨大的作用。　（君）（附图片）
