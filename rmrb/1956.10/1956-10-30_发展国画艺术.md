    Develop the Art of Traditional Chinese Painting

    The Second National Exhibition of Traditional Chinese Painting has closed in Shanghai. Since its opening in Beijing in July of this year, it has been welcomed by a wide audience. Traditional Chinese painting is a valuable part of our national art heritage. It has a long history and rich traditions. Through ingenious conception and vivid depiction, artists of past generations have represented the magnificent rivers and mountains, the beautiful scenery, and the faces of people's lives in various periods, thus winning the love of the broad masses of the people. Traditional Chinese painting itself has formed its expressive forms and unique artistic styles through continuous creation and development.

    In recent years, under the leadership and care of the Party and the government, traditional Chinese painters have made great progress in their thinking and politics, and traditional Chinese painting creation has also made significant improvements in both quality and quantity. After successive social reform movements and facing the large-scale construction of the country, traditional Chinese painters have received great education and encouragement in their thinking. Many traditional Chinese painters have put forward the desire to reflect real life and express the great era, and generally demanded to go deep into reality and participate in the struggle, so that the content of their creations can be enriched. The serious attitude of traditional Chinese painters towards life and creation is commendable. This has not only improved their understanding and confidence in their work, but also created a vibrant atmosphere in traditional Chinese painting creation.

    However, it is undeniable that due to the lack of leadership from the cultural departments towards the traditional Chinese painting circles in the past, and at the same time, some comrades in the art circles adopted incorrect attitudes of underestimation and discrimination towards national heritage and traditional Chinese painters, traditional Chinese painting circles have not received the due attention and support in society. For example, in the past, the absorption of traditional Chinese painters into the Artists Association and its leading organs was not wide enough. In some art academies, some traditional Chinese painting teachers had not taught classes for a long time, and deeply felt suppressed and excluded. In teaching, it was considered unscientific and backward. Traditional Chinese painters' works and writings had few opportunities to be published and published in publishing houses and newspapers and magazines. What is particularly serious is that in some cities, some traditional Chinese painting workers still have difficult lives. Although some of them have participated in the cooperative painting work of arts and crafts, some competent departments often make excessive demands, and some ignore artistic characteristics and simply proceed from an economic point of view, so that this part of people engaged in artistic labor still cannot rely on the income from creation to maintain their lives. These phenomena not only formed obstacles to carrying forward the national heritage and prospering the creation of traditional Chinese painting, but also damaged the enthusiasm of traditional Chinese painters for their careers.

    The Party and the government have always adopted a positive policy of supporting and promoting national art with excellent traditions. Traditional Chinese painting, like other national forms of art, is a cultural achievement created from the long-term life and labor of our people. It has long been closely linked to the thoughts and feelings of the Chinese people, plays an important role in the spiritual life of the people, and is loved by the masses. In this National Exhibition of Traditional Chinese Painting, there are many works that express modern life. The themes chosen by these works mostly reflect the various aspects of the motherland's socialist construction. In terms of figure modeling and scenery depiction, they are generally expressed more naturally, and have made great progress compared with the works in the exhibition at the beginning of liberation. Although these works cannot be said to have reached the realm of perfection, it can be seen from here that traditional Chinese painters are striving to explore new creative methods suitable for reflecting the current great era through their new feelings about life and bold creation in artistic skills.

    People should make demands on the various traditional forms of traditional Chinese painting according to its artistic characteristics, and should not generalize. For example, flowers and birds and landscapes also represent indispensable things in people's lives. The themes they adopt can arouse people's beautiful emotions and meet the needs of people's spiritual life. Therefore, like other forms, they should also be given the opportunity to continue to develop.

    People should not simply use the views and standards of Western painting to demand traditional Chinese painting. Because traditional Chinese painting has its own unique style and skills, based on years of creative experience, it has formed its own methods and theories. Although there are common artistic laws between traditional Chinese painting and Western painting, and some principles are consistent, it must be admitted that until now, the methods and theories of traditional Chinese painting have not been systematically studied and sorted out, and at the same time, it will inevitably be mixed with some unscientific elements. Our task is to actively study and sort it out, absorb its essence, discard its dross, and at the same time absorb the excellent and advanced elements in the methods and theories of Western painting to enrich and improve it. Some people generally deny all the achievements of traditional Chinese painting, and this nihilistic erroneous attitude should be opposed.

    Not long ago, the State Council approved the establishment of the Chinese Painting Academy, vigorously promoted the creation of traditional Chinese painting and cultivated traditional Chinese painting talents. This measure provided new development conditions for traditional Chinese painting work, and the traditional Chinese painting circles were jubilant. At present, the central and local cultural departments are actively planning and arranging traditional Chinese painting work. For example, some traditional Chinese painters in Shanghai and Beijing have partially solved their work problems. After some traditional Chinese painting workers with difficult lives participated in the art service organizations organized by the craft cooperative organs, their lives have also been initially arranged. Recently, the cultural department is also preparing to work with relevant departments to establish a special institution for selling traditional Chinese paintings, arrange a group of traditional Chinese painting teachers in primary and secondary school art teaching, and actively supply the tools necessary for traditional Chinese painters. These measures will further expand the influence of traditional Chinese painting in society and are conducive to the development and prosperity of traditional Chinese painting art. Of course, there are still new problems facing the traditional Chinese painting circles, but the national traditional Chinese painting workers will surely be able to solve these problems through their own efforts. That is to say, the national traditional Chinese painting workers must strive to overcome conservative views, give play to creativity, strengthen unity, launch criticism, absorb the advanced artistic achievements of foreign countries on the basis of learning and carrying forward national traditions, and promote the creation of traditional Chinese painting to a new stage of prosperity.

    发展国画艺术
    第二届全国国画展览会在上海闭幕了。它自从今年7月间在北京开幕以来，受到广大观众的欢迎。国画是我国民族艺术宝贵遗产的一部分，它有悠久的历史和丰富的传统；历代的画家通过精巧的构思和生动的描绘，表现了祖国壮丽的河山、优美的风物和各个时期人民生活的面貌，因而赢得广大人民的喜爱。国画本身也从不断的创造和发展中形成了它的表现形式和独特的艺术风格。
    近年以来，国画家们在党和政府的领导和关怀之下，思想上政治上都有很大进步，国画创作在质和量两方面也有显著的提高。经过历次的社会改革运动和面临国家大规模的建设，国画家们在思想上得到很大的教育和鼓舞，许多国画家提出了反映现实生活、表现伟大时代的愿望，普遍要求深入实际，参预斗争，使创作的内容更加丰富起来。国画家们这种对待生活、对待创作的严肃态度是值得称许的，这不仅提高了他们对于业务的认识和信心，而且造成国画创作上的生气勃勃的气象。
    但是不可否认，由于过去一个时期，文化部门对国画界的领导不够，同时，美术界的某些同志对待民族遗产和国画家采取了不正确的轻视和歧视的态度，这样就使国画界在社会上没有得到应有的重视和支持。比如过去国画家被吸收参加美术家协会及其领导机构的就不够广泛，在某些美术院校里面，有的国画教员长期没有开课，深深感到受压抑，受排斥，在教学上被认为是不科学，是落后。国画家的作品和论著在出版机关和报刊杂志上发表和出版的机会很少。特别严重的是在有些城市中，一部分国画工作者生活还很困难。其中虽然有些人参加了合作性质的工艺美术品的绘制工作，但有些主管部门又往往要求过苛，有的忽视艺术特点，单纯从经济观点出发，使这一部分从事艺术劳动的人还是不能依靠创作的收入维持生活。这些现象不仅对于发扬民族遗产、繁荣国画创作形成了障碍，而且损害了国画家对于事业的积极性。
    党和政府对于具有优秀传统的民族艺术，一向是采取积极的扶植和提倡的方针。国画和其他民族形式的艺术一样，是从我国人民长期的生活和劳动中创造出来的文化成果，它长期地和我国人民的思想感情发生密切的联系，在人民的精神生活中起着重要的作用，为群众所喜爱。在这一次全国国画展览会里面，就有许多作品是表现现代生活的。这些作品所选择的主题大部分是反映祖国的社会主义建设的各个方面的情况，在人物造型、景物描绘上，一般说都表现得比较自然，和解放初期的展览会上的作品相比有了很大进步。这些作品虽然还不能说已经达到完美的境界，但从这里可以看出国画家是在努力通过他们对生活的新的感受和艺术技巧上的大胆创造来探索适合于反映当前的伟大时代的新的创作方法。
    人们对于国画的各种传统形式，应该根据它的艺术特点来提出要求，不应该一概而论。比如花鸟和山水，它们所表现的也是人民生活当中不可缺少的东西，它们所采取的题材能够唤起人们的美好情感，满足人民精神生活上的需要，因此它们同其他形式一样，也应该得到继续发展的机会。
    人们也不应该简单地用西画的观点和标准来要求国画。由于国画具有自己独特的风格和技巧，根据多少年来的创作经验，它形成了自己的方法和理论。虽然，国画和西画之间具有艺术的共同规律，有些原理是一致的；但必须承认，直到目前，国画的方法和理论还没有得到有系统的研究和整理，同时也不可避免地会夹杂一些不科学的成分。我们的任务就是要积极地加以研究整理，吸取其精华，舍去其糟粕，同时也要吸收西画的方法理论中的优良的先进的成分，来丰富和提高它。有些人对于国画的一切成果都笼统地加以否定，这种虚无主义的错误态度是应该反对的。
    不久以前国务院批准成立中国画院，大力提倡国画创作和培养国画人才，这一措施为国画工作提供了新的发展条件，国画界为之欢欣鼓舞。目前中央和地方的文化部门正在积极规划和安排国画工作，如上海、北京两地的国画家部分解决了工作问题，一部分生活困难的国画工作者在参加了工艺合作机关主办的美术服务组织以后，生活也初步得到了安排。最近文化部门还准备会同有关部门，建立专门销售国画作品的机构，在中小学美术教学中安插一批国画教师，积极供给国画家所必需的工具。这些措施都将更加扩大国画在社会上的影响，有利于国画艺术的发展和繁荣。当然，在国画界面前还存在着新的问题，但是，全国国画工作者一定能够依靠自己的努力解决这些问题。这就是说，全国国画工作者要努力克服保守观点，发挥创造性，加强团结，展开批评，在学习和发扬民族传统的基础上吸收外国的先进的艺术成就，把国画创作推进到一个繁荣兴盛的新阶段。
