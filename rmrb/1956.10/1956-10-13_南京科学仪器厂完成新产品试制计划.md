Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 11th: The state-owned Nanjing Scientific Instrument Factory has completed the trial production of all twenty-four new products planned for this year by the end of September, and has begun mass production.

These new products are all teaching demonstration and experimental instruments for optics, electricity, etc., including reflecting astronomical telescopes, 675x biological microscopes, charging rectifiers, and telephone and telegraph machine models.

The reflecting astronomical telescope has a magnification of 120x, and the spherical reflecting mirror has a clear aperture of 104 mm, allowing users to observe planets and the moon. Mass production of this type of astronomical telescope began in October, with 1,000 units to be completed in the fourth quarter. The telephone and telegraph machine model is a teaching demonstration instrument. The model clearly shows the circuit connections, connection methods, and the function of each component of telephone and telegraph machines.

In the process of trial-producing new products, the factory established close ties with scientific research institutions and educational departments, and received assistance from these departments. When manufacturing the reflecting mirror for the astronomical telescope, the Scientific Instrument Museum of the Chinese Academy of Sciences helped them solve the problem of vacuum aluminizing equipment and taught the workers to master the technology of vacuum aluminizing. The factory also established a new physical instrument product technology research committee with physics teachers from middle schools in Nanjing; through this committee, the factory solicited many opinions from relevant parties to improve the products.

    南京科学仪器厂完成新产品试制计划
    新华社南京11日电　国营南京科学仪器厂今年计划试制的二十四种新产品，到9月底为止已经全部完成，并且开始大批生产。
    这些新产品都是光学、电学等教学演示和实验仪器，其中有反射式天文望远镜、六百七十五倍生物显微镜、充电整流器、电话电报机模型等。
    反射式天文望远镜倍数为一百二十倍，球面反光镜通光口径为一百零四毫米，可以观看星球、月亮。这种天文望远镜，10月份起开始大量生产，第四季度将完成一千架。电话电报机模型是一种教学演示仪器。从模型中能清楚地看到电话电报机线路连接情况、连接方法和各部件的作用。
    这个厂在试制新产品的工作当中，同科学研究机关、教育部门建立密切联系，得到了这些部门的帮助。在制造天文望远镜反光镜的时候，中国科学院科学仪器馆帮助他们解决了真空镀铝的设备问题，并且教会工人掌握真空镀铝的技术。这个厂还同南京市中等学校物理教师成立了物理仪器新产品技术研究委员会；工厂通过这个委员会向有关方面征求了不少的改进产品的意见。
