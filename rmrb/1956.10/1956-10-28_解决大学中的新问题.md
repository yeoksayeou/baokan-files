Solving New Problems in Universities

Since the beginning of this semester, universities have taken many specific measures to further improve teaching, reduce students' excessive academic burden, pay attention to strengthening the cultivation of students' independent thinking and working abilities, and students' thoughts have become unprecedentedly active. The atmosphere of independent thinking and research is stronger than before, and life is more lively than before. Democratic life in schools has also expanded, and many new atmospheres have emerged. These are all very good and represent the main aspect of students' current ideological activities.

However, some unhealthy phenomena have also appeared in universities across the country. For example, some students are undisciplined and do not abide by school rules and regulations; some students are not good at using their spare time and do not study hard; some students are unwilling to do social work and do not pay attention to political study, and so on. Although these unhealthy phenomena vary in degree from school to school, they are all worthy of our serious attention. We must work hard to solve the new problems that have arisen in universities in order to advance university education further.

Why do these unhealthy phenomena occur among university students? The main reason is that after taking new measures to improve teaching, various schools have not further explained the significance of these new measures to the students. For example, in order to increase students' self-study time and cultivate students' independent thinking ability, it is correct to allow students to freely allocate their spare time. However, in the specific implementation of this measure, some schools did not clearly explain the reasons to the students, allowed them to drift, and abandoned leadership, so that some students could not make good use of their spare time. Some schools have relaxed their political and ideological work for students and have not kept up with the pace. The Party and Communist Youth League organizations in schools lack experience in how to work under the new situation. In addition, due to the rapid development of school education, there has not been enough time to make full preparations in terms of teaching, learning conditions, etc., which has created some difficulties in the work and has not reasonably arranged students' study and life. In this case, due to the lack of necessary correct guidance, some unhealthy phenomena have inevitably occurred among some students.

However, great achievements have been made in the political and ideological education of university students in the past few years, and healthy thoughts still occupy a dominant position among university students. School leaders should sufficiently estimate this basic situation, cultivate new sprouts, and enable them to grow healthily. At the same time, school leaders should also fully estimate that many students still lack practical experience and are still very naive in all aspects, requiring correct guidance and education to enable them to resist and get rid of the influence of unhealthy factors. Therefore, facing this new change in university students today, we should not doubt the achievements that have been made in their political and ideological education. We should recognize that these unhealthy phenomena can be eliminated, and we should further improve education work on the basis of this achievement and give full play to students' enthusiasm and creativity.

In response to the new problems that have arisen among university students, the leadership of universities should not make simplistic criticisms, but they cannot let things drift. School leaders should explain clearly to students the relationship between the collective and the individual, the relationship between all-round development and the development of individual strengths, the relationship between democracy and centralism, and the relationship between conscious discipline and individual freedom, so that students have a comprehensive and correct understanding of these issues, correctly expand democratic life, establish conscious discipline, and establish correct work styles. The Party and Communist Youth League organizations in schools must learn to do political and ideological work according to the characteristics of school work and in conjunction with teaching, and they must conduct in-depth research, strive to create experience in this area, and improve the level of political and ideological work.

University teachers should strengthen the political and ideological education of students, guide students' study and life, and pay attention to continuously improving the quality of teaching, and strive to improve their own political and ideological level and teaching ability to meet the requirements of students. Schools with insufficient learning conditions should try their best to improve them. Naturally, the improvement of teaching quality and learning conditions cannot be achieved overnight. This requires being realistic and preventing unrealistic ideas and practices that are too high and too hasty.

For the vast number of students, we should promote the atmosphere of hard study. The country and the people place ardent hopes on future construction talents. The vast number of students should respond to this hope with actions of hard study. Students should respect teachers and learn from teachers with humility. We should also promote the style of hard work and simplicity among students, so that they can correctly understand the difficulties in the development of education, and strive to overcome these difficulties, seize the fortress of knowledge, so that they can make important contributions to the motherland in the future.

    解决大学中的新问题
    这一学期开学以来，各高等学校为了进一步改进教学工作，采取了许多具体措施，减轻了学生过重的课业负担，注意加强了对学生独立思考和独立工作能力的培养，学生思想显得空前活跃起来，独立思考和钻研的空气比以前浓厚了，生活也比以前活泼多了，学校民主生活也扩大了，出现了许多新的气象。这些都是非常好的，也是目前学生思想活动主要的一面。
    但是，目前在全国高等学校中也出现了一些不健康的现象。如有的学生自由散漫，不遵守学校的制度和纪律；有的学生不善于利用业余时间，不好好钻研功课；有的学生不愿做社会工作，不重视政治学习，等等。这些不健康的现象虽然在程度上各个学校是不一样的，但是它们都值得我们认真地加以重视。我们必须努力解决目前高等学校中发生的新问题，才能把高等学校的教育向前推进一步。
    为什么在高等学校学生中发生这些不健康的现象呢？主要是各个学校在采取改进教学工作的新措施以后，没有向学生进一步讲清楚这些新措施的意义。例如，为了增加学生的自学时间，培养学生独立思考能力，让学生自由支配业余时间，这个措施是正确的。但是在这个措施的具体执行上，有的学校却没有很好地向学生讲清道理，放任自流，放弃领导，以致有的学生就不能很好支配业余时间。有的学校把对学生的政治思想工作放松了，没有跟上去。学校的党和团的组织对新形势下如何做工作，还缺乏经验。另外，由于学校教育的迅速发展，在教学工作、学习条件等方面也没有来得及做充分的准备，造成了工作中的一些困难，没有合理安排学生的学习和生活。在这种情况下，由于缺乏必要的正确的引导，在有些学生中就不可避免地发生了一些不健康的现象。
    但是，几年来对大学生的政治思想教育工作是有很大成绩的，目前在大学生中健康的思想仍然占主导的地位。学校领导方面应当足够地估计这个基本情况，培植新生的萌芽，使它能够健壮地成长起来。同时，学校领导方面也要充分估计到有许多学生还缺乏实际锻炼，各方面还十分幼稚，需要正确的引导和教育，使他们能够抵抗和摆脱不健康因素的影响。因此，面对着今天大学生中的这种新的变化，我们不应当怀疑对他们的政治思想教育工作已取得的成就，应当认识到这些不健康的现象是可以消除的，应当在取得这一成就的基础上进一步做好教育工作，充分发挥学生的积极性和创造性。
    针对高等学校学生中发生的新问题，高等学校的领导方面，不要作简单化的批评，但是也不能放任自流。学校领导方面要向学生说清楚集体和个人的关系，全面发展和个性特长发展的关系，民主和集中的关系，自觉纪律和个人自由的关系，使学生对于这些问题具有全面的正确的认识，正确地扩大民主生活，建立自觉的纪律，树立正确的作风。学校党和团的组织，要学会根据学校工作的特点，结合教学来做政治思想工作，要深入研究，努力创造这方面的经验，提高政治思想工作的水平。
    高等学校的教师要加强对学生的政治思想教育，指导学生的学习和生活，并且要注意不断提高教学质量，努力提高自己的政治思想水平和教学业务能力，以适应学生的要求。学校学习条件不够好的，要尽可能努力改善。自然，教学质量的提高和学习条件的改善，不是一下子就能够做到的。这就要实事求是，防止过高过急的不切实际的想法和做法。
    对于广大的学生来说，应该提倡努力学习的风气。国家和人民对于将来的建设人才寄予殷切的希望。广大学生应该用努力学习的行动来回答这个希望。学生对教师应该尊敬，虚心向教师学习。在学生中还要提倡艰苦朴素的作风，要他们正确认识教育发展中的困难，并且努力克服这些困难，夺取知识的堡垒，以便将来为祖国作出重要的贡献。
