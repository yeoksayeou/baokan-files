Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 30th: Hong Kong News: In order to guard against Kuomintang special agents plotting to create new incidents, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions sent four representatives to meet with the Chief of Police of the British Hong Kong police on the afternoon of the 29th to make representations and put forward requests.

When the Federation of Trade Unions representatives arrived at the British Police Headquarters, they were received by the Director of the Political Department, Wilcox. The representatives stated: Recently, many workers have reported to the union that they have discovered people manufacturing a large number of armbands in the Kowloon area, possibly using our union's name to create incidents and frame the workers; and according to workers' reports, the special agents have other conspiracies to frame the people. Therefore, we are informing the police of the relevant situation and requesting a prompt investigation and handling.

Wilcox said: "The police will immediately be responsible for investigating these messages." He also pointed out: "The current situation is relatively tense, and something may happen on the 31st, so all police vacations have been canceled and preparations are being made to effectively protect public security."

The representatives of the Federation of Trade Unions continued: Everyone knows that the Kowloon riots were created single-handedly by Kuomintang special agents. However, a few newspapers have distorted the facts, saying that "leftist trade unions created the riots," attempting to confuse the public and slander our workers. It should be pointed out that the workers of Hong Kong and Kowloon have always loved a peaceful, stable life and social order. Our union has always taken it as its purpose to run welfare programs for workers and safeguard their lives and legitimate rights and interests. Therefore, we cannot tolerate such shameless slander. At the same time, after the riots occurred, the Federation of Trade Unions has already made requests to the Hong Kong authorities and the police department to severely punish the instigators and murderers of the Kowloon riots, to take effective measures to ensure the safety of the lives and property of Hong Kong and Kowloon residents, and to make reasonable arrangements for the aftermath. In the future, we will continue to demand that the Hong Kong authorities take responsibility through legal channels to achieve this just goal.

The representatives also pointed out: Now, in view of the fact that some special agent thugs have not yet been arrested, and some workers have seen some leading members being released after being arrested, such as the special agent Yang Foyang, who killed a worker and whose name was written in blood on a pillar by the victimized worker, has appeared in the Tsuen Wan area with several thugs in the past two days, and some special agents have even threatened to stage a second riot and kill more people, causing widespread fear. Therefore, the Federation of Trade Unions believes it is necessary to reiterate its request to the police to arrest the criminals and punish the evil.

In response to these questions, Wilcox revealed that the police are conducting a manhunt, but some murderers have not yet been arrested. He said that he hoped everyone would cooperate with the police to provide clues about the thugs and murderers so that the police can investigate as soon as possible.

The representatives continued, it is currently heard that Kuomintang special agents are carrying out new riot conspiracies. Therefore, it is necessary to ask the police to: effectively protect the lives and property of the working people and maintain social order. The representatives emphasized that the workers and compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon have always hoped to live a peaceful and stable life, and the police should take responsibility for this.

In response to these questions, Wilcox said: The police already know some of these situations. Now the police have sufficient strength to prevent the occurrence of a second riot. The police must take responsibility for maintaining social order and protecting the lives and property of workers and citizens.

    港九工会联合会代表要求香港警察当局
    防止国民党特务制造新的暴乱
    新华社广州30日电　香港消息：港九工会联合会为提防国民党特务分子阴谋制造新的事件，在29日下午派出代表四人往见香港英国的警务处长，有所申述并提出要求。
    工联会代表到达英方警务处时，由政治部主任威路科斯接见。代表们提出：最近有很多工友向工会报告，说在九龙城区内发现有人制造大批臂章，可能冒用我们工会名义，制造事件，嫁祸工人；并根据工友报告，特务分子还有其他阴谋企图嫁祸于人民，因此，特把有关情况通知警方，要求迅速追查，加以处理。
    威路科斯说：“对于这些消息，警方当即负责调查。”同时他还指出：“目前情况比较紧张，在31日可能会发生事情，因此已命令全部警察取消假期，准备切实保护治安。”
    工联会的代表继续说：此次九龙暴乱事件，人人皆知是由国民党特务分子一手制造出来的。但是，有少数报纸竟然歪曲事实，说什么
  “左派工会制造暴乱”，企图淆乱视听，诬蔑我们工人。应当指出：港九工人同胞向来爱好和平、安定的生活和社会秩序，我们工会一向以为工友办好福利事业维护工友的生活和合法权益为宗旨，因此不能容忍这种无耻的诬蔑。同时，在暴乱发生后工联会已经向香港当局和警务处提出严惩九龙暴乱的主事者和凶手，切实采取有效措施，保障港九居民的生命财产安全及合理善后的要求，今后将继续通过合法途径要求香港当局负起责任来达到这一正义目的。
    代表们还指出：现在鉴于有些特务暴徒还未就捕，有些工友还看到有些为首分子被逮捕之后又放走，如杀害工友而被受害工友用血把名字写在柱上的特务杨佛养，近两日来又带了几个打手在荃湾地区出现，并且有些特务扬言要搞第二次，要杀更多的人，使人心惶惶。因此，工联会认为有必要向警方重申缉凶惩恶的要求。
    威路科斯在答复这些问题的时候透露，警方正在进行缉凶工作，可是有些凶手还没有逮捕。他说，希望大家和警方合作，提供暴徒凶手的线索，以使警方尽快追查。
    代表们继续说，目前据闻国民党特务分子正在进行新的暴乱阴谋。因此，有必要向警方提出：要求切实保障工人同胞的生命财产，维持社会秩序。代表们强调指出：港九工人、同胞一向希望过和平、安定的生活，警方对此应负起责任。
    威路科斯在回答这些问题的时候说：这些情况有些警方已经知道，现在警察已有足够力量，去防止第二次暴乱事件的发生，警方对于维持社会秩序和保护工人市民的生命财产，必须负起责任。
