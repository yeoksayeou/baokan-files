Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa Telegram The autumn harvest is nearing completion in the river valleys of the Tibetan Plateau. Although rainfall was uneven in most areas this year, the harvest is still no worse than last year's bumper harvest.

In the Shigatse Plain, known as the "granary" of Tibet, and the vast area on both banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River, the autumn harvest has been underway for half a month. Work teams recently dispatched to Dzong and Manor like Lhatse and Xietongmen are also helping farmers with the autumn harvest. On both banks of the Nyang Chu River, which suffered from floods the year before last, the reconstructed villages are surrounded by piles of highland barley and wheat in the fields, and another bumper harvest has been achieved after the disaster.

In villages along the Lancang and Nu Rivers, many families have set up tents in the fields, inviting relatives and friends to drink and sing before starting the harvest. Now the wooden frames on the roofs of every house are piled high with crops. Farmers in some areas overcame hailstorms and droughts in the summer, preventing excessive crop reduction in the autumn harvest.

In the warm Bomi area, crops were harvested once in late June, and the second planting of highland barley and wheat is already flowering and heading. This area has generally enjoyed a bumper harvest this year, with the Yigong Lakeside, surrounded by snow-capped mountains, seeing an increase of about 10% compared to last year.

In Pulan Dzong in the Peacock River Valley, located below the famous Kangrinboqe (mountain name) on the top of the plateau, this year's crops are growing better than in previous years. The ears of highland barley are large and the grains are full, with some ears growing up to one hundred grains. Farmers say that such crops have not been seen in more than ten years.

On the Lhasa Plain, farmers have successively held "Wangguo" festivals to celebrate the autumn harvest. In the past, crops were transported by donkeys, but this year many rubber-wheeled carts pulled by horses have appeared. The Wugong No. 17 and Nanda 2419 spring wheat varieties, which the Lhasa Agricultural Experiment Station helped a few farmers in Donggar Dzong to trial, have already been harvested in some cases.

    西藏高原秋收快要结束
    年景不低于丰收的去年
    新华社拉萨电　西藏高原各条江河的河谷地带秋收快要结束。今年虽然大部地区雨水不均匀，但是年景仍不低于丰收的去年。
    以西藏“粮仓”著称的日喀则平原和雅鲁藏布江两岸的广大地区，秋收工作已进行了半个月，刚派到拉孜、谢通门等宗和溪卡的工作队，也帮助农民进行秋收。前年遭受水灾的年楚河两岸，重建的村庄旁，青稞、小麦散堆在田野上，灾后再度获得了丰收。
    澜沧江、怒江两岸的村庄，许多人家在田间搭起帐篷，邀请亲友喝酒唱歌，然后开刀收割。现在家家屋顶上的木架子都堆满了庄稼。部分地区的农民战胜了夏季的雹灾和旱灾，使秋收没有过多的减产。
    气候温暖的波密地区，6月下旬已收割了一次庄稼，第二次播的青稞、小麦又扬花吐穗。今年这一带普遍丰收，雪山环抱的衣贡湖滨，比去年增产一成左右。
    孔雀河谷的普兰宗，它在高原顶部著名的康仁波清（山名）的下面，今年的庄稼长得比往年好，青稞的穗子肥大，颗粒饱满，有的一穗长到一百粒。农民说：这样的庄稼是十多年来所没有的。
    在拉萨平原上，农民先后举行了庆祝秋收的“望果”节。往年驮运庄稼的都是毛驴，今年出现了许多马拉的胶轮大车。拉萨农业试验场帮助东噶宗几户农民试行种植的武功十七号和南大2419等春小麦，有的已收割完毕。
