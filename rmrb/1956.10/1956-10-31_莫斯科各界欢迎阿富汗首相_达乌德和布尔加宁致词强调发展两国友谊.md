Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th. A mass rally was held in the Hall of Columns of the House of Trade Unions in Moscow on the 29th by all circles in Moscow to welcome Afghan Prime Minister Daud.

After representatives of the working people of Moscow delivered welcoming speeches, Prime Minister Daud spoke at the meeting. He said: The Afghan people have a long history of friendship with the Soviet people. This friendship has stood the test of time in every historical period on the basis of sincerity, mutual trust and mutual respect. The Afghan people have sought and continue to seek to maintain and strengthen the friendship between our two countries.

Our efforts and desires are to ensure the realization of mankind's great aspirations - happiness and tranquility throughout the world. Afghanistan is willing to get along with the people of all countries in true friendship, and strive to establish closer, friendlier and more sincere relations with the people and countries of the world.

The principles followed by Afghanistan in international policy are neutrality, freedom and independence, and selfless, harmonious coexistence with the people and nations of all countries in the world. For Afghans, this is our traditional policy. We will maintain this policy in the future.

Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin said at the meeting: The relations between our two countries have been and are based on the principles proclaimed by our great teacher and great friend of the Eastern nations, Lenin, and on the principle of mutual respect for territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs. The Soviet Union has always adhered to these principles in its relations with all countries.

Despite the different social and political systems of the Soviet Union and Afghanistan, the friendship between the two countries continues to develop and become more consolidated. This friendship can serve as an example of sincere good-neighborly cooperation in the international arena.

Bulganin said: During our talks in an atmosphere of trust and mutual understanding, we exchanged views on many issues related to our two countries. It should be noted with satisfaction that we have a common understanding on a series of major international issues. The reason for this commonality is that both of our countries are striving to consolidate peace and eliminate the threat of war.

We have also resolved a series of issues in the spirit of friendship that have matured in our economic and technical cooperation. We affirm that the talks we held with the Afghan government in Kabul during our visit last year and the documents signed during these talks have brought great benefits to our two countries.

More than 1,000 people attended the meeting, including advanced workers from Moscow factories, scientific and cultural workers, and representatives from various social organizations. When Soviet state leaders Bulganin, Molotov, Saburov, Khrushchev, Shepilov, Furtseva, and others accompanied Daud to the rostrum, those present warmly applauded their welcome.

After the meeting, a grand song and dance evening was held.

    莫斯科各界欢迎阿富汗首相
    达乌德和布尔加宁致词强调发展两国友谊
    新华社莫斯科30日电　莫斯科各界29日在工会大厦圆柱大厅举行群众大会，欢迎阿富汗首相达乌德。
    在莫斯科劳动人民的代表致了欢迎词以后，达乌德首相在大会上讲了话。他说：阿富汗人民同苏联人民有悠久历史的友谊。这种友谊在历史上各个时期都在真诚、互信、互相尊重的基础上经受住了考验。阿富汗人民过去和现在都力求保持和加强我们两国之间的友谊。
    我们的努力和愿望就是要保证实现人类的伟大心愿——全世界的幸福和安宁。阿富汗愿意同各国人民真正友好相处，力求同全世界的人民和国家建立更密切、友好和真诚的关系。
    阿富汗在国际政策方面所遵循的原则是中立、自由和独立，以及同全世界各国人民和各个民族无私地和睦共处。对阿富汗人来说，这是我们的传统政策。将来我们还要保持这个政策。
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在大会上说：我们两国的关系过去和现在都是以我们伟大的导师和东方各民族的伟大朋友——列宁所宣布的那些原则为基础的，都是以相互尊重领土完整、互不干涉内政的原则为基础的。苏联在同一切国家的相互关系中始终遵循这些原则。
    尽管苏联和阿富汗的社会制度和政治制度不同，两国的友谊仍旧日益发展，日益巩固，这种友谊可作为国际间真诚的睦邻合作的榜样。
    布尔加宁说：我们在信任和彼此谅解的气氛中进行交谈的时候，就我们两国关系上的许多问题交换了意见。应当满意地指出，在一系列重大的国际问题上，我们有着共同的见解。产生这种共同性的原因是，我们两国都在力求巩固和平和消除战争威胁。
    我们还本着友谊的精神解决了一系列在我们经济和技术合作方面已经成熟的问题。我们确认，我们去年访问期间在喀布尔同阿富汗政府所进行的会谈以及在这次会谈中所签订的文件，已经给我们两国带来了很大的好处。
    出席这次大会的有莫斯科各工厂先进工人、科学和文化工作人员、各社会团体的代表一千多人。当苏联国家领导人布尔加宁、莫洛托夫、萨布罗夫、赫鲁晓夫、谢皮洛夫、福尔采娃等陪同达乌德走上主席台的时候，到会者热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    会后，举行了盛大歌舞晚会。
