    Moscow is Building a New Television Center
    World's Largest Television Tower to be Built on Lenin Hills
    (Our Moscow Dispatch, October 30th) Moscow's new television center will be built near Lenin Hills. It will house the world's largest television tower, standing at a height of 500 meters. This is three times higher than the current Moscow television tower, 200 meters higher than the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and even taller than the 449-meter television tower atop a New York skyscraper in the United States. Once completed, the tower will allow direct reception of television programs broadcast from here within a radius of 120 kilometers, without the need for relay stations. At the 400-meter mark of the tower, a dedicated observation deck will be constructed, with elevators transporting tourists to enjoy a panoramic view of beautiful Moscow. The existing Moscow television station will also undergo reconstruction, with the addition of several large broadcasting studios. Two of the newly built studios are intended for future color television broadcasts. These new studios will be equipped with special features, enabling live broadcasts from other locations, as well as relaying Moscow television programs to cities far from Moscow via television relay stations across the country.

    莫斯科正在建立新的电视中心
    列宁山上将建立世界最大的电视塔
    本报莫斯科30日电　莫斯科新的电视中心将在列宁山旁建立起来。这里将建有世界上最大的电视塔，它的高度是五百公尺，比目前的莫斯科电视塔高三倍，比法国巴黎最高的爱菲尔铁塔高二百公尺，比四百四十九公尺高的美国纽约摩天大楼上的电视塔还要高。这个电视塔建成后，在它周围一百二十公里处不用转播台就可以直接收到这里播送的电视节目。在高塔四百公尺处设有专门的了望台，将有电梯接送游客登高瞻望美丽的莫斯科全景。原有的莫斯科电视台也要开始改建，那里将建设起几个大型的广播室。其中有两个新造的广播室是为了将来播送五彩电视的。新建的广播室将安装特别设置，它能直接播送外地的实况，同时也能经过各地的电视转播台，将莫斯科电视节目播送给远离莫斯科的城市。
