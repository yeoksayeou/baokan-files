Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: Pakistan's Prime Minister Suhrawardy, in a radio address to the Chinese people broadcast today on the Central People's Broadcasting Station, said that Pakistan needs to establish peaceful and friendly relations with a large country like China, with mutual understanding and cooperation. The Prime Minister said: "Lasting peace is a necessary condition for progress, and we are determined not to let any factors or forces divert us from the path of peace and progress. I am very happy to see that the Chinese people, like the Pakistani people, have the same genuine desire for peace."

Prime Minister Suhrawardy made this recorded speech to the Chinese people at the invitation of the Central People's Broadcasting Station. In his speech, the Prime Minister first expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for their goodwill and courtesy. He said: "I want to tell you that in my country, people admire the Chinese people very much. We are your close neighbors. The friendly relations between our two peoples have a history of thousands of years. Therefore, it is only natural that the people of the Pakistani government hope that the friendly relations between us will be further consolidated by this visit."

The Prime Minister said: "Everything I have been able to see during this short visit has impressed me profoundly. Flourishing new industries have been established; new roads and new railways are being built; agriculture is being improved and developed on an unprecedented scale. All of this is for the purpose of improving the living conditions of the Chinese people. The enthusiasm and vigor of the Chinese people, their firm determination and discipline, their spirit of sacrifice, and their enthusiasm for the current tasks, have all impressed me deeply."

The Prime Minister then said: "We in Pakistan face similar problems. Pakistan was established only nine years ago, and following our independence came countless difficulties and complex problems. Because we inherited a backward industrial and agricultural economy from the past, our main task is how to distribute food, clothing, work, and housing to the people. Only after solving these basic difficulties will it be possible for us to carry out other work of building our motherland. Nine years after independence, although many difficulties continue to exist, we feel a certain degree of satisfaction when we look back at the achievements we have made. We have restored trade with countries around the world, and many new industries that have been established are already able to meet Pakistan's domestic needs, such as cloth, jute fabrics, paper, cement, and many other daily necessities. Our new five-year plan is about to be finalized. We hope that the completion of this five-year plan will lay the foundation for the systematic and nationwide development of our human, economic, and cultural resources."

The Prime Minister concluded by saying: "Before ending this speech, I would like to thank you once again, both those I have met and those I have not had the opportunity to meet, for your hospitality and goodwill. Let me assure you that we will take back to our country the most pleasant memories we have gained during this visit and from our sincere and friendly contact with your great leaders."

    苏拉瓦底总理向中国人民发表广播讲话
    新华社24日讯　巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底今天在中央人民广播电台向中国人民发表的广播讲话中说，巴基斯坦需要和中国这样的大国建立和平和友好的关系，相互谅解和合作。总理说：“持久和平是进步的必要条件，我们决心不让任何因素或力量使得我们离开和平和进步的道路。我很高兴地看到中国人民像巴基斯坦人民一样，具有同样的真正的和平愿望。”
    苏拉瓦底总理是应中央人民广播电台的邀请向中国人民发表这一录音讲话的。总理在讲话中首先对中国人民对他的善意和礼遇表示感谢。他说：“我要告诉你们：在我的国家里，人们很钦佩中国人民。我们是你们的近邻。我们两国人民的友好关系已经有几千年的历史。因此，很自然，巴基斯坦政府的人民希望我们之间的友好关系，由于这次访问更加巩固起来。”
    总理说：“我在这次短短的访问中所能看到的一切给我极为深刻的印象。欣欣向荣的新工业建立起来了；新的公路和新的铁路正在修建；农业以空前的规模改进和发展着。这一切都是为了提高中国人民的生活条件。中国人民的热情和魄力，他们坚毅的决心和纪律，他们的牺牲精神，对当前任务的热情，都给我深刻的印象。”
    总理接着说：“我们在巴基斯坦面临着类似的问题。巴基斯坦成立了只有九年之久，跟着我们独立而来的是面临无数困难和复杂的问题，由于我们承继了过去落后的工业和农业经济，我们主要的任务是如何分配给人民食物、衣着、工作和住所。只有解决了这些基本的困难以后，我们才有可能进行别的建设祖国的工作。独立了九年后的今天，虽然仍旧有很多困难继续存在，但是当我们回顾起过去所获得的成绩的时候，我们怀着一定程度的满意。我们已经恢复了与世界各国的贸易，很多建立起来的新工业，已经能满足巴基斯坦国内的需要，如布匹，麻织品、纸张、水泥和很多别的日用品。我们新的五年计划即将最后决定。我们希望这个五年计划的完成，将为有步骤和在全国范围内发展我们的人力、经济和文化资源奠定基础。”
    总理最后说：“在结束这次讲话以前，我愿意再一次地感谢你们，感谢我曾经会见过的和那些我没有机会见面的人，感谢你们给我们的款待和善意。让我向你们保证，我们将把我们在这次访问中以及和你们伟大的领袖们诚挚友好的接触中所得到的最愉快的记忆，带回我们的祖国。”
