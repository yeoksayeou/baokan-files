　　The head of the Nanhu Lake Fish and Water Chestnut Cooperative in Jiaxing County, Director Xu, enthusiastically invited me to see them “raising small fish.” The fish fry they stocked in June this year have already grown to the size of a palm; the small ponds are too crowded, and they must be transferred to larger ponds. I had never seen this kind of fish moving work – “raising small fish.” When Director Xu talked about it, it was as if it were some kind of happy event, saying that they would set off in the middle of the night, prepare everything before dawn, and go into the water at the crack of dawn.

　　I was completely attracted by their description. At two o'clock in the morning, I was waiting for the people from their Fourth Team to go together. At this moment, a small fishing boat was rowing over from the darkness. Someone was also shining a flashlight towards me.

　　"Comrade! Get on board!"

　　As soon as I heard the voice, it turned out to be Director Xu. The flashlight shone on the small boat, making it wet and shiny, as if the small fishing boat had just been捞起来from the water, the bow dipping up and down in the waves. I stepped on it, and the small boat left the shore and headed towards the small harbor outside the lake.

　　At this time, the two banks were pitch black. The small boat gently touched the waves, passing through wooden bridges one after another, the bottom of the bridges brushing over our heads. After about twenty minutes, my eyes lit up, and it turned out to be a field of water chestnuts. Director Xu told me that the other side of the water chestnut field was the fish pond.

　　The boat finally docked at a small village. Several figures on the shore shone flashlights at us.

　　"Has the water chestnut picking team left yet?..." Director Xu asked, as he and I went ashore together.

　　"They're eating!" A short, dark figure walked over, and I recognized her as an old woman. She shouted loudly: "Which year haven't I gone to the water chestnut fields! This year the water chestnut fields have joined the cooperative and are growing so well, but they don't even call me to take a look!"

　　"Mom!" A middle-aged man's voice replied from the darkness: "This year you can rest at home, isn't it the same if we go? You're over sixty, enjoy a few years of happiness!..."

　　"Humph! If you want me to enjoy happiness, let me go take a look!..." The old woman laughed: "I'll pick a few, and it won't cost the cooperative any work points, what are you afraid of?..."

　　The middle-aged man insisted:

　　"I won't let you on the boat anyway!..."

　　"If you don't let me on the boat, I'll row a water chestnut basin!"

　　More people came over from the darkness, flashing their flashlights. The round light of the flashlight shone on the trees and on the water surface. Only then did I see that behind me were six or seven small wooden boats, with wooden basins on them that were specially used for picking water chestnuts. I said:

　　"Old lady! You're healthy! How many people are in your family?"

　　"Healthy, but they won't let me go to the water chestnut fields!" The old woman said loudly: "Our old couple raised three sons, and now our family has twenty-four people, big and small! Comrade! Look at our fresh water chestnuts this year!" The old woman turned around and pointed, and I saw four or five large baskets on the open space, filled with green fresh water chestnuts.

　　At this time, Director Xu stood over there and shouted:

　　"Comrade! Cast the nets! We're raising small fish!..."

　　I followed the sound and found that the cooperative's fish ponds were connected one after another. Director Xu was steering a small boat on the fish pond, and there were also people rowing water chestnut basins. They threw a net several feet long into the water. There were also several people pulling the net heads, who simply stood in the water, dragging the net forward.

　　As the long net moved, it dawned, and the small fish were also disturbed. The originally calm water surface suddenly jumped with groups of bright little fish. Facing the dawn, the small fish shone silvery white all over, jumping into the net and out of the net. I couldn't help but shout:

　　"They're running! They're running!..."

　　"They can't run!" Director Xu said, "Two months ago, we bought these fish fry by the bowlful! ... Look, they're in the net now!" He smiled straight at me. I thought, this one net of small fish, this boat wouldn't be able to hold them all! I couldn't suppress my excitement and really wanted to jump onto their small boat. Looking up into the distance, under the glow of the morning sun, to the left of the village was a vast expanse of green water chestnut fields. Many small boats had already stopped by the aquatic plants in the water chestnut fields. A white-haired person was rowing a water chestnut basin with a bamboo pole, shouting loudly, slowly rowing into the water chestnut field and blending into the crowd of water chestnut pickers, no longer distinguishable. I thought, is this the sixty-year-old old woman with twenty-four family members?

　　Only where the distant trees and mountains meet the water, the red and bright sun appeared. For a moment, I couldn't even open my eyes. This year's Nanhu Lake is such a year of abundant fish and water chestnuts!

    南湖的鱼和菱
    柯蓝
    嘉兴县南湖鱼菱合作社的许社长，热情地邀我去看他们“起小鱼”。他们今年6月放养的鱼秧，已经长得有一巴掌大了；小塘里已经挤不开，必须分移到大塘里去。这种移鱼的工作——“起小鱼”，我还没有见过。许社长谈起这件事，仿佛是一件什么喜事似的，说半夜里就要动身，天亮以前要把一切准备好，天蒙蒙亮就要下水。
    我完全被他们的介绍吸引住了，早上两点钟的时候。我就在约会的地点等他们四小队的人一起去。这时候黑影里有一只小渔船摇着橹过来了。还有人用手电朝我这边照了过来。
    “同志！上来吧！”
    我一听声音，原来是许社长。手电光照着小船又湿又亮，小渔船好像刚从水里捞起来似的，船头低低地一上一下地插在水浪里。我一脚踏上去，小船就离了岸，朝湖外小港开去了。
    这时两岸是一片漆黑。小船轻轻地碰着水浪，穿过一座一座的木桥，桥底就在我们的头上擦过。大约走了二十多分钟，我的眼前发亮，原来这是一片菱田。许社长告诉我，菱田的那边就是鱼塘了。
    船终于在一个小村靠岸了。岸上几个人影朝我们打过手电光来。
    “采菱队走了吗？……”许社长问，一面和我一同上了岸。
    “正在吃饭！”一个矮小的黑影走过来，我看出是一个老妈妈。她在大声嚷：“哪一年我不下菱田！今年菱田入了合作社，又长得旺，看也不叫我去看看！”
    “妈！”一个中年男人的声音在黑暗里回话：“今年你老就在家休息，有我们去还不一样吗？六十几啦，也享几年福吧！……”
    “哼！让我享福就让我去看看！……”老妈妈笑了：“我去采几颗，又不要社里算我工分，怕什么？……”
    那个中年男子还在坚持说：
    “反正不让你上船！……”
    “不让我坐船，我划菱盆去！”
    黑暗里又有人过来了，一闪一闪地打亮着电筒。手电筒的圆光照在树上，照在水面上，我这才看见就在我后面，停着六七只小木船，木船上放着一些够坐一个人的、专门用来采菱的木盆。我说：
    “老妈妈！身体健呀！家里多少人啦？”
    “健还不让我下菱田咧！”老妈妈大声说：“我们老两口养三个儿，现在我们一家大大小小是二十四口！同志！你看我们今年的鲜菱吧！”老妈妈转过身指了一指，我这才看清楚，空地上摆了四五个大箩筐，满满地装着绿绿的鲜菱。
    这时候，许社长站在那边喊：
    “同志！下网啦！我们起小鱼啦！……”
    我跟着声音追过去，发现合作社的鱼塘一片连一片。鱼塘上许社长驾着小船，也还有划着菱盆的，他们扯着一张几丈长的网抛在水里。另外还有扯网头的几个人，他们就干脆站在水里，拖着网往前走。
    长网移动的时候，天发亮了，小鱼也惊动了。原来平静的水面上，顿时跳起了一群群的光亮亮的小鱼。迎着黎明的曙光，小鱼混身银亮银亮的发光，跳到网里，又跳到网外。我忍不住帮着喊：
    “跑啦！跑啦！……”
    “跑不了！”许社长说：“两个月前，这鱼秧我们还是用茶杯一碗一碗量买来的咧！……你看现在上网啦！”他望着我直笑。我看就是这一网小鱼，这条船都装不了！我抑压不住自己的兴奋，真想也跳到他们的小船上去。抬头朝远处望去，在一片朝霞的辉映下，村子左边就是一大片广阔的绿汪汪的菱田，许多小船已经停在菱田的水草旁。一个头发花白的人用竹杆划着一只菱盆，在大声地说喊着什么，慢慢地划进菱田就混到采菱的人群里去，再也分辨不出来了。我想这就是那个六十多岁、有着二十四口人的老妈妈吗？
    只有远树远山和水相接的地方。冒出了又红又亮的太阳花花。一时连眼睛也睁不开了。今年的南湖就是这么一个鱼、菱丰收年啊！
