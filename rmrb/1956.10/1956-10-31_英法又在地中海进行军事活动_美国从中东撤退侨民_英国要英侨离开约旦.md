Xinhua News Agency, October 30th, Nicosia, Cyprus: Just as Israeli troops invaded Egypt and advanced towards the Suez region, Britain and France are conducting new military deployments in the Mediterranean region.

Currently, British and French troops at an air base near Limassol, Cyprus, have been ordered to "strengthen their alert." On the evening of the 28th, three more French warships arrived at Famagusta port, bringing the number of French ships in the port to nine.

At the same time, most ships of the British Mediterranean Fleet have sailed from Malta to participate in "liaison exercises" in the region. The British Royal Marines commando unit in Malta has also received orders to be ready to depart within twenty-four hours of receiving a sailing order.

France has also recently sent a cruiser and a submarine to Malta for a "visit."

Xinhua News Agency, October 30th: According to reports from the capitals of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Israel, American nationals in these countries began to evacuate in batches from these countries on October 29th.

The evacuation of American nationals from these countries was carried out immediately after the US State Department issued a statement. The State Department said in a statement issued on October 28th that due to the tense situation in the Middle East, it was asking all Americans who were not essential to remain in the Middle East to leave the region.

Meanwhile, the British Foreign Office announced on October 29th that the British government had advised all British nationals in Jordan who were not engaged in indispensable work to leave Jordan.

    美国从中东撤退侨民　英国要英侨离开约旦
    新华社30日讯　塞浦路斯尼科西亚消息：正当以色列军队侵入埃及向苏伊士地区迫进的时候，英法又在地中海地区进行新的军事部署。
    目前，在塞浦路斯利马索尔附近的一个空军基地的英法军队已经奉命“加强戒备”。28日晚上，又有三艘法国军舰开到了法马古斯太港，从而使停在这个港口的法国船只增加到九艘。
    同时，英国地中海舰队的大多数舰只已经驶出马耳他岛去参加在这个地区举行的“联络演习”。而在马耳他岛的英国皇家海军突击部队也已经接到命令，要他们在接到出航命令以后的二十四小时内作好出发准备。
    法国最近也派了一艘巡洋舰和一艘潜水艇到马耳他“访问”。
    新华社30日讯　据来自埃及、约旦、叙利亚、以色列首都的消息说，美国在这些国家的侨民在10月29日开始分批从这些国家撤走。
    美国侨民从这些国家撤离是在美国国务院发表声明后立即进行的。国务院在10月28日发表的声明中说，由于中东局势紧张，它要求所有非必要留在中东的美国人撤离这个地区。
    同时，英国外交部在10月29日宣布，英国政府已经劝告约旦境内所有并非担任不可脱离的工作的英国侨民离开约旦。
