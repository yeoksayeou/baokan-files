Xinhua News Agency, Port Said, 4th: Egyptian Interior Minister Zakaria Mohieddin said on October 3rd that Britain and France are "pirates and robbers" who still intend to seize the Suez Canal from Egypt.

He called on the Egyptian people to remain vigilant. He said: "Your enemy is cunning and deceitful. You have come to understand him through his long occupation."

Mohieddin said that Western countries will continue to wage "psychological warfare" against Egypt. "We should not be deceived by their talk of wanting peace, nor should we think that the possibility of aggression has diminished."

Mohieddin made these remarks while speaking at a police speedboat competition held at the Port Said Police Maritime Club. He said: "We have struggled hard and persistently, and now that we have tasted the taste of freedom, we will never allow any pirates or robbers to come and deprive us of our freedom, exploit us, or violate our dignity."

Mohieddin said that the withdrawal of the last batch of British troops from the Suez Canal area this year was "a historic event."

    埃及内长号召人民保持警惕
    指出英法仍然打算抢夺苏伊士运河
    新华社4日讯　塞得港消息：埃及内政部长查卡里亚·摩海丁10月3日说，英法两国是“海贼和强盗”，它们仍然打算从埃及手中把苏伊士运河夺走。
    他要求埃及人继续保持警惕。他说：“你们的敌人是老奸巨滑，诡诈多端的。经过他的长期的占领，你们已经了解了他。”
    摩海丁说，西方国家将仍然在对埃及进行“心理战”。“我们不应受关于它们希望和平的那一套话的欺骗，同时我们也不应认为发生侵略的可能性已经减小。”
    摩海丁是在塞得港警察水上俱乐部所举行的警察快艇比赛会上讲话时这样说的。他说：“我们曾经含辛茹苦、坚持不懈地进行斗争，现在，我们既然已经尝到了自由的滋味，我们就决不允许任何海贼或者强盗再来剥夺我们的自由、剥削我们或者侵犯我们的尊严。”
    摩海丁说，今年最后一批英国军队的撤出苏伊士运河地区，是“一个具有历史意义的事件”。
