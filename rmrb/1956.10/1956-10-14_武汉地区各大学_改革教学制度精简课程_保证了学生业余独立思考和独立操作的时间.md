Xinhua News Agency report: This semester, universities in the Wuhan area have generally adopted measures to reduce students' excessive academic burden. The weekly class hours for students in all schools have generally been reduced to below thirty hours.

While ensuring the cultivation of qualified personnel, various universities have canceled some course categories and reduced the class hours for certain courses. Central China Normal College appropriately reduced the public political theory courses and public education courses, and discontinued the "History of Education" and "School Hygiene" courses. Zhongnan University of Economics and Law changed the compulsory course "History of Chinese and Foreign National Economy" from 140 hours to 122 hours, and "Fundamentals of State and Law" from 98 hours to 72 hours. Now, the weekly class hours for first and second-year students at this school are generally 24 to 26 hours, while those for third and fourth-year students are only 18 to 22 hours, basically ensuring that students' weekly self-study hours are no less than their class hours. Central China Institute of Technology, which previously had the heaviest academic burden for students, also merged some auxiliary courses this semester, streamlined the originally redundant course content, reduced the number of exercise sessions for first and second-year students, and canceled exercise sessions for third and fourth-year students.

This semester, various universities also paid attention to improving teaching methods and the daily schedule system to provide students with more conditions for independent thinking and independent work. The physics teaching and research group of Wuhan Technical University of Surveying and Mapping extended the time for each experiment class and increased students' opportunities for independent operation. In terms of concentrating time for teaching, this school generally ensures that there are no empty periods in the morning, so that students can concentrate their time for self-study. Central China Normal College also stipulates that students are free to arrange their time outside of class hours.

In addition, various schools have also taken some specific improvement measures to address phenomena that hinder students' learning, such as excessive part-time jobs, meetings, and social activities.

    武汉地区各大学
    改革教学制度精简课程
    保证了学生业余独立思考和独立操作的时间
    据新华社讯　这学期武汉地区各高等学校普遍采取措施减轻学生在学习中过重的负担。各校学生每周上课时数已普遍降低到三十小时以下。
    在不影响培养合乎规格的人材的原则下，各高等学校取消了一些课程门类，减少了某些课程的上课时数。华中师范学院对公共政治理论课和公共教育课作了适当的缩减，停开了“教育史”和“学校卫生”两门课。中南财经学院把共同必修课“中国与外国国民经济史”由原来的一百四十小时改为一百二十二小时，“国家与法的基础”由原来的九十八小时改为七十二小时。现在这个学校一、二年级学生每周上课时数一般是二十四到二十六小时，三、四年级只有十八到二十二小时，基本上保证了学生的每周自学时数不少于上课时数。过去学生学习负担最重的华中工学院，这学期也合并了某些辅助性的课程，精简了原来重复了的课程内容，并减少了一、二年级的习题课的时数和取消了三、四年级的习题课。
    各高等学校这学期还注意了改进教学方法和作息时间制度，使学生更加有独立思考和独立工作的条件。武汉测量制图学院物理教研组延长了每次实验课的时间，增加了学生独立操作的机会。在集中时间进行教学方面，这个学校一般做到了上午不空堂，这样学生就能集中时间进行自修。华中师范学院还规定除上课时间外，其他时间由学生自由支配。
    此外，各校对学生的兼职多、会议多、社会活动多等妨碍学习的现象也都采取了一些具体的改进措施。
