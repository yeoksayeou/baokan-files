Lu Xun wrote some memorial articles in his lifetime, mourning and cherishing his respected predecessors, friends, and young people who sacrificed themselves for the revolution. Lu Xun wrote these articles with sincere emotion, deep sorrow and indignation, mingled with deep friendship and blood and tears for the deceased and the living. After reading them, we are deeply moved. The memorial articles written by Lu Xun are by no means trivial. They were not written casually because he happened to recall a friend. These articles were all written under the compulsion of a fighting comrade's friendship and sense of responsibility. He was not writing general memoirs for personal friends, but erecting monuments for revolutionary martyrs, speaking out for the persecuted and distorted righteous people, and writing portraits for his respected teachers. These articles reflect not only the relationship between the author and the people he commemorated, but more importantly, the entire historical background and the situation of the revolutionary struggle. From them, we can see Lu Xun's deep friendship with his friends, his hatred and anger towards the dark society and the reactionary rulers.

With a few events as the backbone, and with just a few strokes, the characters are brought to life before us. He highlights their superior qualities, but does not hide their shortcomings. Only in this way can people see a vivid, flesh-and-blood "whole person," brushing away the dust of history, refuting the misunderstandings and slanders of ordinary people and villains, and using solemn strokes to paint a true portrait of the person being commemorated. This portrait, like a mirror, also reflects the personality and character of the commemorator himself.

After reading these articles, it is as if there is a thick darkness before our eyes, and in the darkness flashes the鮮血的鮮紅 blood-red color.

After reading these articles, our chests feel suffocated and we can hardly breathe, and a feeling of deep sorrow and anger湧出 surges from our hearts.

After reading these articles, it is as if there is a voice calling us, a voice that stirs people up and makes them unable to be still.

Let's turn back the clock twenty-five years.

It was precisely the time of winter's end and spring's arrival in 1931. The backdrop of the era was thick and dark. The "blood of the pioneers" of the five martyrs, Rou Shi, Bai Mang (Yin Fu)..., was as bright red as the fire in the dark night, like the dawn of dawn.

It was two years after the deaths of Rou Shi, Bai Mang...the five martyrs that Lu Xun wrote his famous "In Memory of Forgetting."

When "they" "went to the execution ground," Lu Xun was avoiding the persecution of the Kuomintang, hiding in a "inn," where he chanted that famous poem "Accustomed to passing spring in long nights" but "had nowhere to write." Two years later, in the dead of night, he could not forget and "heavily felt that I had lost good friends, and China had lost good young people." Lu Xun wrote such memorial articles in order to "dig a small hole" from the blood of "many young people" that had "accumulated layer upon layer" to "breathe." Lu Xun ended "In Memory of Forgetting" with these words:

"The night is long, and the road is long, I might as well forget and not say it. But I know that even if it is not me, there will always be people in the future who will remember them and talk about them..."

I finished reading these sentences with tears, but there was also a smile in those tears. Because the "future" that Lu Xun spoke of has now arrived.

Look, isn't that Rou Shi? With the "hardiness of Taizhou," a "bit pedantic," always "believing that people are good," when "talking about how people can deceive people, how they can sell their friends, how they can suck blood," his "forehead" would be "bright and shiny," and he would "open his nearsighted eyes in surprise and protest: 'Would that be so? – It wouldn't be that bad, would it?…'"

"As long as it's something that harms himself and benefits others, he'll pick it up and carry it himself." He was so brave in the fight against the enemy, and sacrificed himself so heroically. However, when walking with "female fellow villagers or friends," he always kept a distance of "three or four feet." When he went out with Lu Xun, he was afraid that cars and trams would hit him, so he walked very close, "practically holding on to" him, while Lu Xun felt that he was nearsighted and worried about himself, making them both "panic and worry all the way." The shadow of a strong yet gentle and lovable young man vividly stands before our eyes.

Lu Xun wrote a "short biography" for Rou Shi, and wrote a preface for his collection of novels "February." Lu Xun's grief over the death of this unyielding young revolutionary fighter, who was still diligently learning "German" in prison and still thinking of Lu Xun, was profound. As mentioned above, it was not only because he personally lost a good friend, but because China lost a good young man!

Lu Xun met Bai Mang because he submitted articles to "Benliu" (Torrent). They did not meet many times, but their friendship was deep. Like Lu Xun, Bai Mang loved Petőfi's poems very much. The poem "Life is precious, love is even more valuable; if it is for the sake of freedom, both can be discarded," which was widely circulated at the time, was Bai Mang's translation published in "Benliu," which was edited by Lu Xun. Lu Xun highly valued his character and work, and gave him his treasured collection of Petőfi's essays and poems. Unfortunately, both books fell into the hands of "Sandao Tou" along with Bai Mang. Lu Xun loved this revolutionary youth in his twenties, who had a "very upright appearance" and "dark skin." How moving is the scene when he came out of prison, wearing a "thick cotton robe" in the hot summer, "sweating all over," and they both laughed at each other upon seeing each other. Such a good young man died tragically at the hands of the reactionaries. After his death, Lu Xun not only wrote the painful article "In Memory of Forgetting," but also wrote a preface to his posthumous poems – "The Child's Tower" – with a "sleepless" heart "clutching a ball of fire," calling it a poem that "belongs to another world."

Lu Xun felt deeply saddened by the deaths of Rou Shi, Bai Mang, and the other five martyrs, and a surge of uncontainable anger湧動 surged between the lines. The blood of these comrades wrote the "first article" of "proletarian revolutionary literature," which "will forever show the enemy's vile brutality and enlighten our continuous struggle."

"In Memory of Liu Hezhen" is of the same nature as the articles commemorating Rou Shi, Bai Mang..., except that one executioner was Duan Qirui, and the other was Chiang Kai-shek. Liu Hezhen was one of the forty-odd brave young people who sacrificed in the "March 18th Massacre." She died in front of the government building, covered in bullet holes and club marks. The reactionary government's guards used guns and clubs to beat these patriotic and passionate young people, while those shameless running-dog literati slandered them with rumors. The great youth of China became "rioters" "exploited by others" in their eyes.

Liu Hezhen was Lu Xun's student, but he only got to know her after she was expelled from "Women's Normal University" for resisting Yang Yinyu's appointment as president. She "often smiled," and her "attitude was very gentle." When she was "concerned about the future of her alma mater, she was saddened to the point of tears." Such a pure-hearted patriotic youth was killed as a "rioter" in front of the dignified government building.

Lu Xun expressed his most sincere admiration and respect for Liu Hezhen, and for the courageous and fraternal spirit of Yang Dequn, who sacrificed himself to protect her, and Zhang Jingshu, who was seriously injured. Their "capable, determined, and unyielding spirit" could not but make people "sigh." The fact that they "helped each other in the rain of bullets, regardless of their own lives" proved the "courage and perseverance" of Chinese women. Their deaths had a great enlightening and encouraging effect on those who came later. Lu Xun felt intense grief for the victims of the "March 18th Massacre," because they "were Chinese youth who died for China." He was filled with unspeakable rage at the "soldiers" who prided themselves on their "great achievements in massacring women and children," and at the reactionary warlord government, whose "evil intentions" he "could not even begin to fathom," and which had become "so vile and brutal." He could only "sing loudly as a lament." This "In Memory of Liu Hezhen" is the most mournful eulogy for the dead, and also a righteously worded and angrily charged indictment against the reactionary regime.

Zhang Taiyan was a predecessor whom Lu Xun admired and was influenced by. He admired him not because he was a scholar of classics and philology, "but because he was a revolutionary with learning."

"About Mr. Taiyan's Affairs" is filled with the author's enthusiasm and sense of justice. He criticized the shortcomings and weaknesses of the person he admired and loved, but mainly he promoted and praised his characteristics and great achievements. He advocated that those strongly combative articles written by Zhang Taiyan in his early years should be included in his posthumous works, "so that the teacher and the students can resonate with each other," and that it "live in the hearts of the fighters." Lu Xun used the following passage to answer those "commentators" who were "dissatisfied" with Zhang Taiyan. These words are truly vigorous and appropriate, and inspiring:

"Examining his life, there is no second person in the world who used a big medal as a fan pendant and stood in front of the Presidential Palace to scold Yuan Shikai for harboring evil intentions. There is also no second person in the world who was hunted down seven times, imprisoned three times, and whose revolutionary aspirations were never subdued. This is the spirit of the sage and the model for future generations."

Fan Ainong, Liu Bannong, and Wei Suyuan were all friends who had deep relationships with Lu Xun. After their deaths, Lu Xun wrote memorial articles. In these articles, Lu Xun not only wrote about his personal interactions with them, but also wrote about their personalities and his evaluations of them.

Fan Ainong was a student of Xu Xilin, who assassinated "Anhui Governor Enming." He resisted the Qing Dynasty when he was studying in Japan. When he returned to his hometown, he was "subjected to contempt, rejection, and persecution, and had almost nowhere to live." With a full head of white hair, he was "hiding in the countryside" "teaching a few elementary school students." After the success of the Xinhai Revolution, the old warlords took over the new positions. Fan Ainong remained in a wretched and drifting state, and finally fell into the water while drunk and died.

In order to mourn his lifelong unfortunate old friend, Lu Xun wrote the article "Fan Ainong" and several sorrowful and moving old-style poems, which wrote about his personality and the environment of that era. Liu Bannong was an old friend of Lu Xun during the "May Fourth" era. He was "lively and brave" and was "a fighter" who "fought several major battles" in "New Youth." He was open-minded and frank. Although he was a bit "hasty" and a bit "superficial," and inevitably lacked courage "without strategy," his character was lovable, so Lu Xun was very "close" to him. Later, he "gradually took up important positions" and "constantly wrote witty poems and messed up ancient prose," which made his old friend Lu Xun unable to help but "sigh," and even feel "disgust." But this "disgust" belonged to "a friend's disgust." Lu Xun had feelings for him and always treated him as a friend. Some "quicksand ghosts" wanted to "drag his former glory and corpse into the abyss of the mud," so Lu Xun stood up and "illuminated his achievements with my own angry fire," showing how affectionate he was to his friend.

Wei Suyuan was a young friend who co-founded the "Unnamed Society" with Lu Xun. He was "thin" but "shrewd," "serious," and had "few smiles" on his face, but he had the will to work "practically," "bit by bit," and "keep going." He was "too serious," and his calmness concealed intensity. He did a lot of work and translated many works. He was often sick. In the early autumn of 1927, Lu Xun received a cloth-bound copy of "The Overcoat" that he had translated in Guangzhou. When he realized that it was sent as a permanent memento, he "shivered." Lu Xun did get a final opportunity to meet him. The scene of visiting him in the "Xishan Hospital" is described very movingly. Lu Xun used emotion as ink to write it down. He died of illness, and Lu Xun wrote this memorial article with a heavy heart, comparing him to "a piece of stone" in a tall building and "a pinch of soil" in a flower garden, and "forever placed" that "overcoat" "by his side."

"Mr. Fujino" was a person who was still alive when Lu Xun wrote the memorial article. He was Lu Xun's anatomy teacher when he was studying at the "Medical Specialized School" in Sendai, Japan. "Dark and thin," with a "walrus mustache," and "wearing glasses," "carrying a stack of books of all sizes," "as soon as he put the books on the podium, he used a slow and rhythmic tone to introduce himself to the students: –

'My name is Fujino Genkuro….'" He wears an old coat in winter and often forgets to bring his tie. How homely and approachable he is. However, he is serious and meticulous when he works. He asked Lu Xun to hand in his copied lecture notes, and carefully and meticulously used a red pen to add and correct all the mistakes and omissions, and even corrected grammatical errors. This moved Lu Xun and enabled Lu Xun to improve in both his academic pursuits and his personal conduct through his teachings, encouragement, and hope. Fujino's "rhythmic words" became a whip to urge Lu Xun forward, and his photograph "is still hanging on the east wall of my Beijing residence, opposite the desk."

From the seven memorial articles written by Lu Xun above, we can see his deep affection for his friends, and we can see the thoughts and spirit of Lu Xun as a people's warrior. The images of these seven figures he commemorated will be immortal along with his memorial writings!

    鲁迅写的纪念文章
    臧克家
    鲁迅生平写了一些纪念文章，追悼、怀念他所敬爱的前辈、朋友和为革命牺牲了的青年。这些文章，鲁迅是用了真挚的情感、沉痛悲愤的心情，和着对死者和生者深刻的友谊和血泪写成的，读过之后，我们深深地被打动。鲁迅所写的这类文章，决非等闲之笔，为了偶然回忆起某一个朋友便感兴地写了下来。这些文章，都是在被一种战斗的同志的情谊和责任感驱迫着非写不可的情况下写出来的。他不是在为个人的朋友写一般的回忆录，而是在为革命烈士立碑，在为被迫害、被歪曲的正义人士伸张，在为他所敬重的先生写照。这些文章反映的不只是作者个人和他所纪念的人物的关系，更重要的是反映了那整个时代背景和革命斗争的形势，从里边看到了鲁迅对朋友们的深厚的情谊、他对黑暗社会与反动统治者的仇恨和愤怒。
    凭着几桩事件作主干，不多几笔，把人物活现在我们面前。突出他的优胜过人处，但也不掩饰他的缺点。这样才可以令人看到一个活生生的、有血有肉的“全人”，拂去历史的尘土，驳斥一般庸人和恶人的误会和侮蔑，以严正的笔墨给被纪念的人绘出一幅真实的肖像，这肖像镜子似地又反映出纪念者本人的人格与性格。
    读过这些文章，眼前仿佛一片浓黑，浓黑里闪着血的鲜红。
    读过这些文章，胸中窒息得有点喘不过气，一种沉痛愤怒的情感从心里涌出。
    读过这些文章，好似有一种声音在呼唤我们，这声音使人激动得不能静止。
    叫时光倒退二十五年。
    那正是1931年冬尽春来的时候。时代的幕布是浓黑的。柔石、白莽（殷夫）………五烈士的“前驱的血”鲜红的像暗夜的火，像黎明的曙光。
    在柔石、白莽……五烈士死了两年以后，鲁迅才写下了他那有名的“为了忘却的记念”。
    当“他们”“走向刑场”的时候，鲁迅正逃避国民党的迫害，躲在“客栈里”，在那里他吟成了却“无写处”的那一首“惯于长夜过春时”的有名的诗。事过两年，在夜深人静的时候，不能忘却地“沉重的感到我失掉了很好的朋友，中国失掉了很好的青年”。鲁迅写这样的纪念文章，是为了从“层层淤积起来”的“许多青年”的血里，“挖一个小孔”“呼吸”。鲁迅是以这样几句话作为“为了忘却的记念”的结尾的：
    “夜正长，路也正长，我不如忘却，不说的好吧。但我知道，即使不是我，将来总会有记起他们，再说他们的时候的。……”
    我强忍住泪读完这几句，但这泪里也闪着笑。因为鲁迅所说的“将来”现在已经到了。
    你看，那不是柔石吗？带着“台州式的硬气”，样子“有点迂”，总是“相信人们是好的”，“谈到人会怎样的骗人，怎样的卖友，怎样的吮血”，那“前额”就“亮晶晶的”，“惊疑地圆睁了近视的眼睛，抗议道：‘会这样的么？——不至于此吧？……’”
    “只要是损己利人的，他就挑上，自己背起来”，对敌人斗争是那样勇敢，牺牲得那样悲壮，然而“和女性的同乡或朋友”走路，总是距离“三四尺”；和鲁迅一同外出，他担心汽车电车撞着他，走得很近，“简直是扶住”他，而鲁迅呢，觉得他是近视眼又为自己担心而不安，弄得彼此“仓皇失措的愁一路”。一个坚强而又温柔可爱的青年的影子活显显地立到我们眼前了。
    鲁迅为柔石写过“小传”，为他的小说集“二月”作过序言，对于这位在狱中还一心学“德文”、对鲁迅犹念念不忘的不屈不挠的青年革命战士的死，鲁迅的悲痛是深沉的。上面已经说过，这不仅是为他个人失去好的朋友，而是为中国失掉了好青年呵！
    鲁迅认识白莽，是由于他向“奔流”投稿，见面的次数并不多，交情却是深厚的。白莽同鲁迅一样，很爱裴多斐的诗，那首传诵一时的“生命诚宝贵，爱情价更高；若为自由故，二者皆可抛”的诗，就是白莽的译作登在鲁迅主编的“奔流”上的。鲁迅对于他的为人和工作是很器重的，把自己珍存的裴多斐的散文集和诗集送给了他。可惜这两本书和白莽一同落到“三道头”的手里去了。鲁迅对于这位“面貌很端正”“颜色是黑黑的”二十多岁的革命青年，是热爱的。当他刚从狱里出来，酷热的夏天，“穿着一件厚棉袍”，“汗流满面”，一见之下，彼此失笑的情况，写得多么动人呵。这样一个好青年，惨死在反动派的手里。在他死后，鲁迅不但写了“为了忘却的记念”的沉痛文章，还用了“捏着一团火”的“寝食不安”的心情给他的遗诗——“孩儿塔”作了序，称它为“属于别一个世界”的诗。
    鲁迅对柔石、白莽等五位烈士的死，是深深感到悲痛的，有一股按捺不住的愤怒之情在字里行间涌动。这些同志们的鲜血，写下了“无产阶级革命文学”的“第一篇文章”，它“永远在显示敌人的卑劣的凶暴和启示我们的不断的斗争”。
    “记念刘和珍君”，和纪念柔石、白莽……的文章，性质是一样的，所不同的，一个刽子手是段琪瑞，另一个是蒋介石。刘和珍是“三一八”惨案四十几个勇敢牺牲的青年里的一个。死在政府门前，满身枪眼加上棍棒的伤痕。反动政府的卫士们用枪棒打这些爱国的热血青年，而那些无耻的走狗文人用流言蜚语中伤她们。中国的大好青年成了他们眼中“受人利用”的“暴徒”。
    刘和珍是鲁迅的学生，但晚在她为反抗杨荫榆作“女子师范大学”校长而被开除以后才认识她。脸上“常常微笑着”，“态度很温和”。当她“虑及母校前途，黯然至于泣下”。这样心地洁白的爱国青年，被当作“暴徒”杀死了，死在堂堂的政府门前。
    鲁迅对于刘和珍，和为掩护她而牺牲了的杨德群、受重伤的张静淑的勇敢、友爱精神表示了最真挚的赞叹和敬意，她们的那种“干练坚决，百折不回的气概”不能不使人“感叹”，从“在弹雨中互相救助、虽殒身不恤的事实”，证明了中国女性的“勇毅”，她们的死亡，对于后来者，有着很大的启发鼓舞作用。鲁迅对“三一八”惨案的牺牲者，感到剧烈的悲痛，因为她（他）们“是为了中国而死的中国的青年”，对于那些以“屠杀妇婴的伟迹”自傲的“军人”，和用了“最坏的恶意”，也“推测”不到的“竟会下劣凶残到这地步”的反动的军阀政府，愤恨到不能用“什么言语”表达，只有“长歌当哭”。这篇“记念刘和珍君”是对于死者的最沉痛的祭文，也是对于反动政权的一篇义正词严怒气冲天的控诉书。
    章太炎，是鲁迅所崇敬而受到影响的一个前辈。他崇敬他，不是因为他是经学家、文字学家，“却为了他是有学问的革命家”。
    在“关于太炎先生二三事”里，洋溢着作者的热情和正义感。对他所钦敬崇爱的人，批评了他的缺点和短处，但主要的是发扬歌颂了他的特点和伟绩。他倡议把章太炎前期所写的那些战斗性强烈的文章，收到他的遗著里去，“使先生和后生相印”，使它“活在战斗者的心中”。鲁迅用下面一段话答复了那些对章太炎“不满”的“论者”，这些话真是气盛言宜，令人激动：
    “考其生平，以大勋章作扇坠，临总统府之门大诟袁世凯的包藏祸心者，并世无第二人：七被追捕，三入牢狱，而革命之志终不屈挠者，并世亦无第二人：这才是先哲的精神，后生的楷范。”
    范爱农，刘半农，韦素园，都是和鲁迅交往甚深的朋友，在他们死后，鲁迅写下了回忆文章。在这些文章里，鲁迅不但写出了他和他们的私人交往，更写出了他们的人格和他对他们的评价。
    范爱农是刺杀“安徽巡抚恩铭”的徐锡麟的学生，他在日本留学时就反抗满清，及至回到故乡以后，“又受着轻蔑，排斥，迫害，几乎无地可容”，满头白发了，“躲在乡下”“教着几个小学生”。辛亥革命成功了，旧军阀坐上了新位子。范爱农依然狼狈、飘零，终于醉中坠水而死。
    为了悼念他一生潦倒的老朋友，鲁迅写了“范爱农”这篇文章和几首沉痛动人的旧诗，这些诗文写出他的人格和那个时代的环境。刘半农是鲁迅“五四”时代的老朋友，他“活泼、勇敢”，是“新青年”里“很打了几次大仗”的“一个战士”。他胸怀坦落，虽然“草率”一点，“浅”一点，也未免失之有勇“无谋”，但他的性格是可爱的，所以鲁迅很“亲近”他。后来，他“渐渐的据了要津”，“不断的做打油诗，弄烂古文”，使老朋友鲁迅不能不为之“长叹”，甚至发生“憎恶”。但这“憎恶”是属于“朋友的憎恶”，鲁迅对他是有情感的，始终把他当朋友看待的。一些“陷沙鬼”，想把半农“先前的光荣和死尸一同拖入烂泥的深渊”，鲁迅挺身而出，以自己的“愤火照出他的战绩”，对友人是多么深情呵。
    韦素园是和鲁迅一道创办“未名社”的青年朋友。他“瘦小”然而“精明”、“正经”，脸上“笑影少”，然而对于工作却有着“切切实实”“点点滴滴”“做下去”的意志。他为人“太认真”，沉静里蕴藏着激烈。他作了许多工作，译了许多作品。他经常生病。1927年初秋，鲁迅在广州接到了他翻译的一本布面装订的“外套”，当他明白了这是作为永久纪念品而寄来的时候，“就打了一个寒噤”。鲁迅同他到底得到了一个最后会面的机会，“西山病院”里探病的那个场面，描写很动人，鲁迅是用了情感作墨水写了下来的。病死了，鲁迅以沉痛的心情写了这篇纪念文章，把他比作高楼的“一块石材”，花“园中的一撮泥土”，把那本“外套”“永远放在自己身边”。
    “藤野先生”，是鲁迅写纪念文章时还活在人间的一个人。他是鲁迅在日本仙台“医学专门学校”读书时候教解剖学的先生。“黑瘦”、“八字胡”、“戴着眼镜”，“挟着一叠大大小小的书”，“一将书放在讲台上，便用了缓慢而很有顿挫的声调，向学生介绍自己道：——
    ‘我就是叫作藤野严九郎的……。’”冬天穿一件旧外套，时常忘记带领结，多么家常的令人亲近的人呵，可是作起事情来却严肃认真、一丝不苟。他要鲁迅交出抄写的讲义，仔细而又认真地用红笔添改了所有的错漏的地方，连文法的错误也给订正了。这使鲁迅感动，使鲁迅从他的教诲、鼓励和希望里，得到提高，不论在做学问或做人方面。藤野的那“抑扬顿挫的话”成为督促鲁迅前进的鞭策，他的照片“至今还挂在我北京寓居的东墙上，书桌对面”。
    从上面鲁迅所写的七篇纪念文章里，可以看出他对朋友的深情，可以看出作为人民战士的鲁迅的思想和精神。他所纪念的这七个人物的形象将和他的纪念文字同垂不朽！
