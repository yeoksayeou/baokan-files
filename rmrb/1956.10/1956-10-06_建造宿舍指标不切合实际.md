    Unrealistic Dormitory Construction Targets

    In recent years, factories and enterprises across various regions have encountered a difficulty in resolving the housing problem for employees: the economic indicators for dormitory construction, originally stipulated by the State Planning Commission, do not align with the actual situation.

    According to the economic indicators for dormitory construction in industrial and mining enterprises originally stipulated by the State Planning Commission, the ratio of single to family dormitories should be five to five. However, according to estimates from some new factories, it can only be four to six; older factories have more employees with families, necessitating the construction of more family dormitories. The urban utilization rate indicator deviates even more significantly from the actual situation. According to the original regulations of the State Planning Commission, the urban utilization rate for new factories and enterprises constructing dormitories in various regions is generally 20% to 30% (i.e., utilizing 20% to 30% of existing local housing). According to this regulation, only remote forestry and mining areas can resolve the housing problems for all employees; new factories in new industrial zones can only resolve 80%, and those near existing medium-sized cities can only resolve 70%. There are no specific regulations for urban utilization rates for old factories; generally, they follow the same proportion as new factories. Utilizing existing local housing requires two conditions: first, the city where the factory is located must have surplus housing; second, the factory must be able to absorb a certain number of employees locally who already have housing in the city. However, what is the actual situation? Since Liberation, the population of various cities has grown significantly, and housing problems are widespread. The possibility of allocating houses to factories is very small. Moreover, new industrial zones, due to their poor initial conditions, offer even less possibility of allocating houses to workers. On the other hand, most employees of new factories are transferred from other places, especially in regions with relatively underdeveloped industrial foundations, making it difficult to recruit workers locally. Even if some new workers are recruited locally, it is difficult to utilize urban housing if the factory is far from the city. For example, the newly built Petroleum Machinery Factory in Lanzhou may only be able to recruit a number of employees locally equivalent to 10% of the total factory workforce. A certain newly built factory in Harbin is far from the city. Currently, among the 2,100 employees who have already arrived at the factory, fewer than 100 households originally lived in the city, meaning the urban utilization rate is only 5%.

    Because this indicator is unrealistic, some new factories have encountered significant difficulties in resolving employee housing problems. For example, a certain newly built factory in Harbin is only allowed to build 37,500 square meters of dormitories according to the indicator, but the actual dormitory area required by this factory is 54,500 square meters, meaning the dormitory area built according to the prescribed indicator only reaches slightly more than 68% of the actual need. The Beijing Second Machine Tool Factory can only build 2,270 square meters of dormitories according to the indicator, but actually needs 8,000 square meters. Furthermore, the existing dormitory area of the Wuchang Vehicle Factory has already exceeded the indicator, but there are still more than 200 employees with families living in single dormitories, unable to reunite with their families. In addition, more than 100 employees who have brought their families can only live in temporary sheds built with bark.

    How can this problem be resolved? "He who tied the bell on the tiger must untie it." Please, relevant central departments, consider revising this unreasonable indicator!　Jinxi

### 建造宿舍指标不切合实际

    建造宿舍指标不切合实际
    几年来各地工厂企业在解决职工宿舍问题中碰到了一个困难，就是国家计划委员会原来规定的建造宿舍经济指标，同实际情况不相符合。
    按照原来由国家计划委员会规定的工矿企业职工建造宿舍经济指标，单身和家属宿舍建造比例为五比五，可是根据一些新厂的估算，只能为四比六；老厂有家属的职工较多，就需要更多地建造家属宿舍。城市利用率的指标和实际情况出入更大。按照原来国家计划委员会的规定，各地区新建工厂企业建造宿舍的城市利用率一般都是20％到30％（即要利用当地旧有房屋20％到30％）。按这个规定，只有偏僻的林区和矿山才能解决全部职工宿舍问题，新建厂在新工业区只能解决80％，在现有中等城市附近只能解决70％。老厂城市利用率没有具体规定，一般是按照新厂比例，利用当地旧有房屋要有两个条件：一是工厂所在城市有多余的房屋；一是能在当地吸收一定数量的职工，他们在城市原来有房子住。可是，实际情况是怎样呢？解放以来，各城市人口都有很大增长，住房问题普遍紧张，拨让房子给工厂的可能性很小；新工业区由于原有条件差，给工人拨让房子的可能性更小。另一方面，目前新厂大部分职工都是从外地调去的，特别是工业基础比较落后的地区，很难从当地吸收工人；就是在当地吸收到一部分新工人，如果工厂离城较远，利用城市房屋也很困难。如兰州新建的石油机械厂，可能在当地吸收的职工人数只相当于全厂职工人数的10％。哈尔滨某新建厂离城较远，目前在已经到厂的两千一百名职工中，原来就住在城内的还不到一百户，也就是说，城市利用率只达到5％。
    由于这项指标定得不切合实际，一些新建厂在解决职工宿舍问题的时候，就发生了很大的困难。如哈尔滨某新建厂按指标规定，全厂只能建造宿舍三万七千五百多平方公尺，但是这个厂实际需要的宿舍面积是五万四千五百多平方公尺，即按照规定指标建造的宿舍面积只达到实际需要的68％多一点。北京第二机床厂，按指标只能建造宿舍二千二百七十平方公尺，实际需要八千平方公尺。又如武昌车辆厂现有宿舍面积，按指标计算已经超过，但是还有二百多户有家属的职工住在单身宿舍不能和家属团聚，另有一百多个已把家属带来的职工，只得用树皮搭盖临时棚屋居住。
    这个问题怎么解决呢？“解铃还需系铃人”，请中央有关部门考虑来修改一下这个不合理的指标吧！　今昔
