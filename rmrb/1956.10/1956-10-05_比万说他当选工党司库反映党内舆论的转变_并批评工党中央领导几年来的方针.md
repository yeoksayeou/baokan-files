Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from London: British Labour Party left-wing leader Aneurin Bevan said at a meeting organized by the "Tribune" weekly on the evening of October 3 that his election as Labour Party Treasurer "shows a shift in party opinion."

    Bevan said, "In the past four or five years, a divergence has arisen between the central leadership of the Labour Party and the broad masses of party members." "Party meetings have begun to become rather unreal, and the decisions made do not represent the opinions of the broad masses of party members." Bevan believes this is a "mistake" and said, "The current central guiding principles of the Labour Party have turned to the left. This is timely, because in my view, the shift to the left in Labour Party internal opinion is in line with the shift to the left in national opinion." Bevan also attacked the Labour Party Executive Committee for committing the Labour Party to the issue of rearming West Germany. He said: This practice "has caused enormous damage to the labor movement, to the country, and to sensible public opinion worldwide."

    In his speech, Bevan attacked the Conservative government's foreign policy. He accused the Conservatives of "showing all the signs of old age" and suffering from "political sclerosis."

    比万说他当选工党司库反映党内舆论的转变
    并批评工党中央领导几年来的方针
    新华社4日讯　伦敦消息：英国工党左翼领袖比万10月3日晚上在
  “论坛”周报组织的一个集会上说，他当选为工党司库“表明党内舆论的转变”。
    比万说，“在过去四、五年中，工党的中央领导同广大党员群众之间产生了分歧”。“党的会议开始成为相当不真实的，作出的决定并不代表广大党员群众的意见。”比万认为这是一个“错误”，并且说，“目前工党的中央指导方针已经向左转。这是适时的，因为在我看来，工党内部舆论的向左转是同全国舆论的向左转相适应的。”比万还攻击工党执行委员会使工党在重新武装西德问题上承担了义务。他说：这个做法“给劳工运动、对国家以及全世界明智的舆论造成了巨大的损害。”
    比万在讲话中抨击了保守党政府的外交政策。他指责保守党“正在表现出一切老迈龙钟的迹象”，并且害着“政治硬化的病”。
