	"What Category Does a Shaved Head Fall Into?" Ye Maochun
	It's not at all surprising that a store issues a receipt when you buy a pair of socks or a pair of shoes. But now, it's a bit novel to have a receipt issued even when you get a haircut.

	The Wangqiao and Sunliukou District Tax Bureaus in Minquan County, Henan Province, stipulate for the barber industry: "A receipt must be issued for every haircut," otherwise it will be regarded as tax evasion. This regulation not only brings unnecessary difficulties to barbers (some of whom are illiterate, so they have to ask someone to issue the receipt every time they give a haircut), but the masses also feel awkward, and can't help but say: "Getting a receipt for a haircut, that's really something."

	Cancel this annoying "receipt"! Otherwise, the masses will ask: "What category should a shaved head be classified into?" Wouldn't that make people laugh?

	Issuing a receipt may be to prevent tax evasion, but may I ask: Can't the problem of tax evasion be solved without issuing receipts?

	Things that are dispensable should best not be done; things that are not necessary to do, should be cancelled altogether!

### “剃过的头算那路货呢？”

    “剃过的头算那路货呢？”　叶茂春
    买双袜子或买双鞋，商店里要开一张发货票给买主，这没有什么足以为奇的地方，而现在理个发也要开张发票，就有点新奇了。
    河南民权县王桥、孙六口区税务局给理发业规定：“剃头必须开发票”，否则以漏税论。这个规定不仅给理发师带来了不必要的困难（他们之中有些人是不识字的，所以理一次发，还得请一个人开发票），群众呢，也很蹩扭，少不了要说一句：“剃个头也开发票，真少有。”
    取消这个惹人讨厌的“发票”吧！不然的话，群众还会问：“剃过的头，究竟该算那路货呢？”那岂不是要把人笑坏了吗？
    开张发票，可能是为了防止漏税，但试问：不开发票难道就不能解决漏税问题吗？
    可有可无的事情，最好不要做；不是必要做的事情，就根本取消吧！
