    Prosperity Brought by Free Trade

    (Our newspaper dispatch) Recently, in Wulian Market in Jiange County, Sichuan Province, whenever it's market day, bustling crowds flow endlessly all day long. The market's peak season has arrived.

    The flourishing scene in Wulian Market is due to the restoration of free markets under state leadership. Originally, the Jiange County Supply and Marketing Cooperative adopted a "contract" method for commodity purchases and sales, stipulating that local merchants could only purchase goods from the cooperative and were not allowed to purchase directly from production units or go to other places to purchase goods. Now, the cooperative has canceled the "contract" method and organized nineteen small merchants from Wulian, Dongxing, Xiuzhong, and other market towns, allowing them to frequently move around to attend markets. In addition to selling goods on behalf of the cooperative, they can also freely purchase livestock, scrap copper and iron, and various local and special products such as Chinese medicinal herbs, bamboo and wood products, and fruits.

    These small merchants, with buying and selling in the market, have very free transactions, which not only increases their income but also provides convenience to the masses. In the past, the seven Chinese medicine shops in the Wulian district had to purchase goods in Jiange County. Even the medicinal materials produced in Wulian had to be purchased by the Jiange County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, transported to the county, and then transported back to Wulian. This round trip of more than one hundred li unnecessarily increased the commodity circulation links, increased costs, and raised prices. Now, the Jiange County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has allowed most of the medicinal materials to be directly purchased and supplied by the pharmacies, and also allows merchants from other counties who have been trading goods in the Jiange area for many years to come to Jiange to do business, truly achieving smooth commodity circulation.

    自由成交带来的繁荣
    本报讯　近来，四川省剑阁县武连场每当逢集的时候，熙熙攘攘的人群，终日川流不息。市场旺季已经来临了。
    武连场上的繁荣气象，是由于恢复了在国家领导下的自由市场所带来的。本来，剑阁县供销合作社对商品购销是采取一手“包干”的办法，规定当地商贩只能向该社进货，不许直接向生产单位或到外地去进货。现在，这个供销社取消了“包干”的办法，把武连、东兴、秀钟等场镇的十九个小商贩组织起来，让他们经常流动赶场，除了替供销社代销商品外，还可以自由地收购牲畜、废铜烂铁和中药材、竹木器、水果等各种土特产品。
    这些小商贩，在市场上有买有卖，交易非常自由，不仅增加了收入，而且也便利了群众。过去，武连区的七家中药铺，必须在剑阁县进货，甚至就在武连出产的药材，也要先由剑阁县供销社收购后运到县里，再从县里运回武连来。这样往返一百多里路，徒然增加了商品的流转环节，加大了费用，提高了售价。现在，剑阁县供销社已让出大部分药材由各药店直接收购和供应，并且允许历年来在剑阁一带贩运货物的外县商贩到剑阁来做生意，真正作到了货畅其流。（任世荣）
