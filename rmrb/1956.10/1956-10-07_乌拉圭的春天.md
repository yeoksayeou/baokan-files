　　Uruguay's Spring
　　Yú Lín

　　According to the seasons, the end of August is still winter in Uruguay, but when we arrived in Uruguay's capital, Montevideo, we found it was already spring. We arrived at night and didn't get a clear view of the city. When we got up the next morning and opened the curtains, we were immediately captivated by the spring scenery: in front of us was the Plaza Independencia, the city center, with a bronze equestrian statue of Artigas, the national hero of Uruguay's War of Independence, towering in the center of the square, surrounded by dense palm trees providing shade, and four ingenious fountains on the lush lawn. Beyond the government building on the south side of the square, you can see the mouth of the Plata River, as wide as the ocean, with huge liners heading for the vast Atlantic Ocean. When we left the hotel, we saw spring everywhere: there are beautiful beaches and riverside avenues here. This avenue extends along the river and the Atlantic coast all the way to Brazil. In summer, it is an excellent bathing place. Although it is still winter, there are many barefoot mothers and children chasing and playing on the beach. The Rose Park, with more than 800 kinds of roses, is not yet in the flowering season, but red or yellow flowers can already be seen in the green leaves on the rose racks. In the residential area, blooming wisteria climbs all over the fences, and ripe kumquats extend out of the walls. Although we encountered continuous rain, and local friends said it was the coldest day, we only thought of spring.

　　This feeling of spring does not only come from the scenery. The Uruguayan people's love for our art and their repeated expressions of willingness to enhance friendly relations and cultural exchanges between the two countries made us feel the warmth of spring. On the night of our first performance, we encountered a storm. Usually, people are unwilling to go to the theater in such wind and rain, but the Teatro Sordres, where we performed, was filled with people eager to appreciate Chinese art. There were Uruguayan government officials and foreign envoys, as well as colleagues from the cultural and artistic circles and ordinary audiences. Their preferences, views, and qualities may be different, but they unanimously broke the habit of not applauding during the performance. Warm applause kept coming from the audience. During the intermission, Batlle Berres, former Chairman of the Council of State of Uruguay, current member of the Council of State, and leader of the majority faction of the Colorado Party, met with the leaders of the art troupe and highly praised the performance. Ordinary audiences and people from the cultural circles congratulated us, using Spanish, French, English and other languages to try to express their feelings. Many people said: "It's great to see Chinese art here. When I first heard that you were coming, I thought it was a dream, but now you're really here!" The Chairman of the Council of State of Uruguay, Subiria, also watched our performance the next day. When he received the person in charge of the art troupe in the government building, he not only praised Chinese art, but also sincerely expressed his desire to develop cultural and economic exchanges between the two countries.

　　We also held a charity performance specifically for children. Uruguayan elementary school students all wear white smocks. That afternoon, the theater turned into a snow-white color, and more than 2,000 children enthusiastically applauded and cheered. Their emotions remained so warm that our actors were very excited.

　　In the intervals between performances, we also tried to find time to meet with Uruguayan artists and learn from them. On the afternoon of September 6, we visited the Uruguayan National Comedy Troupe at the Solís Theatre. The person in charge of the comedy troupe and famous actors took us to visit the stage, dressing rooms, and costume rooms, and introduced us to the Solís Theatre, which had just celebrated its 100th anniversary. The famous actress Zorrilla invited everyone to look at her costume, saying:
　　"This is the costume for playing 'The Government Inspector,' I play the mayor's wife." We told her that Chinese actors had performed this play long ago, and she was very surprised to hear that. We said that what is performed here is only a part of Chinese drama, and that China also has spoken dramas and new operas. Our policy for art is: "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new." This aroused her great interest. She and other actors from the comedy troupe asked many questions about acting, singing, and dancing, and were most interested in the Chinese actors' eye and hand performances, and constantly asked our actors to perform for them on the spot. We also asked them many professional questions. Both sides attached great importance to such conversations, and were willing to learn from and observe each other, and believed that such contact would become more and more frequent and extensive in the future.

　　In order to further understand the cultural life of the Uruguayan people, we also watched a performance at the El Galpón Theatre. This theater is very small, with less than two hundred seats, with the audience around the stage in the center. The play performed that day was called "The Isabel Collings Case," written by an American writer based on a true story, depicting a girl named Isabel who had to work as a prostitute because of family difficulties. However, because she was a minor, she violated the national law and was brought to court for trial. Her poor parents were also summoned. A young neighbor named Pietro, who loved her, tried to help her escape the clutches of the law, but in the end she was sentenced to imprisonment. Although we couldn't understand the dialogue, we were completely drawn into the performance due to the actors' realistic performances and the realistic significance of the plot. In particular, it should be pointed out that the form of the El Galpón Theatre combines the audience and the stage together, as if we were sitting in the audience of the court, personally participating in the events that happened on the stage. What surprised us most was the discussion after the performance. Under the chairmanship of a judge, the audience and actors enthusiastically discussed for two and a half hours, not only talking about the realistic significance of the drama, but also raising issues such as family education, women, children, and society. Different opinions were debated repeatedly. This not only reflects the Uruguayan people's serious attitude towards art, but also demonstrates their concern for social issues.

　　We only performed seven shows in Uruguay and stayed for less than ten days, but we made many friends. When we said goodbye to our friends at the airport, we used the Spanish we had just learned, while our friends used Chinese, saying "goodbye" to each other. Although neither side's pronunciation was accurate enough, it symbolized the cultural exchange between the two countries. This visit and performance is the beginning of this exchange, and I believe we will be back soon. At that time, perhaps the 800 kinds of roses in the Rose Park will be in full bloom, and we will see a more beautiful spring in Uruguay.

    乌拉圭的春天
    俞林
    按季节说，8月底乌拉圭还是冬季，可是当我们到达乌拉圭的首都蒙得维的亚时，却发现这里已经是春天了。我们是夜晚到的，没有看清市容。第二天早起，我们一拉开窗帘，立刻被充满着春意的景色吸住了：面前是作为城市中心的胜利广场，场中央高耸着乌拉圭独立战争中的民族英雄阿尔蒂加斯乘马的铜像，四周围着密叶成荫的棕榈，在嫩绿的草坪上有四个奇巧的喷泉。越过广场南面的政府大楼，可以看到像海洋一样宽的普拉特河口，巨大的航轮正驶向辽阔的大西洋。等我们走出旅馆，更是处处看到春天的景象：这里有着美丽的河滩和沿河大道，这条大道沿着河和大西洋岸，一直延伸到巴西。夏季这里是极好的浴场。虽然现在还是冬季，但是沙滩上也有不少赤着脚的母亲和儿童在追逐着玩耍。有八百多种玫瑰的玫瑰公园，虽然还不到开花的季节，在玫瑰架上的绿叶丛里已可看到红色或黄色的花朵。在住宅区，盛开的紫藤爬满了栅栏，成熟了的金橘伸出墙外。尽管我们遇上了连绵的阴雨，而且当地朋友说这是最冷的日子，我们想到的却只是春天。
    这种春天的感觉不只是从景色得来的，乌拉圭人民对我们的艺术所给予的热爱和屡次表示的对增强两国友好和文化交流的愿望，使我们感到了春天的温暖。我们首次演出的夜晚，遇到了狂风暴雨。平时人们是不肯冒着这样的风雨去剧院的，可是在我们上演的索德雷剧院里却坐满了急于欣赏中国艺术的人们。这里有乌拉圭政府的官员和外国使节，也有文化艺术界的同行和普通的观众。他们的喜好、观点和素养可能各有不同，但是他们却一致打破了演出中途不鼓掌的习惯。从观众席里不断地传出热烈的掌声。在休息的时候，乌拉圭前国务会议主席、现任国务委员、红徽党多数派的领袖巴特耶·柏莱斯和艺术团的领导人会了面，并且对演出大加赞赏。普通观众和文化界的人士都向我们祝贺，他们用西班牙文、法文、英文以及其他语言设法表达自己的心情。很多人说：“能在这里看到中国的艺术，真是太好了，最初听说你们要来，还以为是做梦，现在可真的来了！”乌拉圭国务会议主席苏比利亚第二天也看了我们的演出，当他在政府大楼接见艺术团负责人的时候，除了称赞中国的艺术，还诚恳地表示了开展两国文化经济交流的愿望。
    我们还专门为孩子们举行了义演。乌拉圭的小学生都穿白色的罩衫。这天下午剧场里变成了一片雪白的颜色，两千多孩子们热情地鼓掌欢呼，情绪始终这样热烈，使我们的演员十分激动。
    在演出的空隙里，我们还争取时间和乌拉圭的艺术家会面，并且向他们学习。9月6日下午，我们到苏利斯剧院访问乌拉圭国家喜剧团。喜剧团的负责人和著名演员带着我们参观了舞台、化装室和服装室，给我们介绍刚刚纪念过一百周年的苏利斯剧院。著名的女演员左里拉请大家看她的服装，说：
  “这是演‘钦差大臣’的服装，我演市长夫人。”我们告诉她中国演员很早就演出过这个戏，她听了十分惊奇。我们说在这里演出的只是中国戏剧的一部分，中国还有话剧和新歌剧，我们对艺术的方针是：“百花齐放，推陈出新”。这引起了她极大的兴趣。她和其他喜剧团的演员又问了很多关于表演、唱腔和舞蹈上的问题，对中国演员的眼睛和手的表演兴趣最大，不断请求我们的演员当场表演给他们看。我们也同样问了他们很多业务上的问题，双方都十分重视这样的交谈，都愿意互相学习和观摩，而且相信这样的接触以后会越来越频繁和广泛。
    为了更进一步了解乌拉圭人民的文化生活，我们还看了一次园剧场的演出。这个剧场很小，不到二百个座位，观众在四周，中间是舞台。这天演出的话剧叫“伊莎贝尔·柯林斯案件”，是一位美国作家根据真实的事件写成的，描写一个叫伊莎贝尔的少女，因为家庭困难，不得不做妓女。但是因为未成年，触犯了国家的法律，因而被带到法庭上受审。她的可怜的父母也被传讯。爱着她的一位邻居青年彼得罗企图使她逃出法网，可是最后她还是被判处了徒刑。虽然我们听不懂台词，但是由于演员现实主义的表演和剧情的现实意义，我们完全被演出吸引住了。特别应该指出的是：园剧场的形式使观众和舞台结合在一起，好像我们就坐在法庭的旁听席上，亲身参与了舞台上所发生的事件一样。最使我们惊奇的是演出后的讨论，在一个法官的主持下，观众和演员一起热烈地讨论了两个半小时，除了谈到戏剧的现实意义，还提出了家庭教育、妇女、儿童以及社会等问题。不同的意见还做了反复的辩论。这不仅反映出乌拉圭人民对艺术的严肃态度，而且也表现出他们对社会问题的关心。
    我们在乌拉圭仅仅演出了七场，停留了不满十天，可是我们却结识了不少朋友。当我们在机场和友人们告别的时候，我们用刚学会的西班牙话，朋友们却用中国话，相互说着“再见”。虽然双方的发音都不够准确，可是这却象征着两国文化的交流。这次访问演出是这种交流的开始，相信我们不久还会来的，那时候，玫瑰公园里的八百多种玫瑰也许正在盛开，我们在乌拉圭将看到更加艳丽的春天。
