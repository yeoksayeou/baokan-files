Xinhua News Agency, October 28th (via TASS, Paris, October 27th): Parisian newspapers report that, while the Moroccan public continues to demand the release of arrested Algerian leaders, the French military headquarters stationed in the Meknes region of Morocco, without the consent of the Moroccan government, arbitrarily dispatched French police to occupy the Meknes police station building. The French military headquarters in Rabat even stated: "French troops are on high alert, ready to immediately intervene (against the mass protests against the French kidnapping of Algerian national leaders)."

The Moroccan government has lodged a protest with the French authorities regarding this matter. The protest pointed out that the French military authorities, without obtaining any consent from the Sultan of Morocco, are exercising functions that do not belong to them. The protest also emphasized "the seriousness of the situation thus created."

Public protests in Tunisia are also continuing. Local residents are striving to obstruct the concentration of French troops towards the Algerian border. Newspapers report that clashes have occurred between French troops and local residents about forty kilometers from Tunis. According to "Le Figaro," the French naval command has dispatched warships to the Tunisian coast.

    法军同突尼斯居民发生冲突
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社巴黎27日讯：巴黎报纸报道，在摩洛哥公众继续要求释放被捕的阿尔及利亚领袖的情况下，驻扎在摩洛哥麦克尼斯地区的法国军队司令部未得摩洛哥政府同意，擅自派遣法国警察占据了麦克尼斯警察局大厦。法国驻拉巴特军队司令部并且说：“法国军队已枕戈待命，准备立刻（对群众抗议法国绑架阿尔及利亚民族领袖运动）进行干预。”
    摩洛哥政府已经就这件事向法国当局提出抗议。抗议指出，法国军事当局没有取得摩洛哥苏丹的任何同意，就行使不属于它的职能。抗议还着重指出“因此而形成的局势的严重性”。
    突尼斯公众的抗议运动也在继续进行。当地居民竭力阻挠法国军队向阿尔及利亚边境集中。报纸报道，在距离突尼斯市四十公里的地方，法国军队和当地居民发生了冲突。据“费加罗报”报道，法国海军司令部已经派遣军舰前往突尼斯海岸。
