Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: Cairo Dispatch: Following an emergency meeting held on the 23rd, the "Algerian National Liberation Committee" announced that it had appointed two new leaders to continue the work of those leaders who had been kidnapped by France. Medani, former Secretary-General of the "Algerian Council of Sages," will replace the arrested Khider as the political leader of the "Algerian National Liberation Front." The Committee did not announce the name of the person who will replace Ben Bella as the military leader.

On the same day, the "Algerian National Liberation Front" issued a letter to Algerian fighters, condemning France's act of hijacking its leaders as constituting an "unprecedented fraud," and calling on Algerian fighters to continue to strengthen their struggle against French colonial rule.

The letter to fighters pointed out that the "Algerian National Liberation Front" has taken effective measures to make up for the damage caused to its ranks by the French kidnapping. It said: "Today, the liberation struggle continues, just as it did yesterday. Now, this battle is more powerful and more fierce than before."

The letter to fighters said that "this vile imperialist trick" cannot destroy or weaken the revolution. It declared: "The Algerian National Liberation Army has the material and moral capacity to continue the struggle until we achieve the unchanging goal of our country, which is to declare national independence..."

    法国的卑鄙诡计挽救不了它的殖民统治
    阿尔及利亚人民将在新领袖领导下战斗到底
    新华社24日讯　开罗消息：“阿尔及利亚民族解放委员会”在23日举行了紧急会议后，宣布已经委派了两个新的领袖来代替被法国绑架的领袖继续进行工作。“阿尔及利亚贤哲会”的前总书记梅达尼将代替被捕的基德尔为“阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线”的政治领袖。至于代替贝拉为军事领袖的人的姓名，委员会没有宣布。
    同一天，“阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线”发表了告阿尔及利亚战斗者书，谴责法国劫持它的领袖的行径构成了“史无前例的骗局”，并且号召阿尔及利亚的战斗者继续加强反对法国殖民统治的斗争。
    告战斗者书指出，“阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线”已经采取了有效的措施来弥补法国的绑架对它的队伍所造成的损害。它说：“今天解放战斗在继续进行，就像昨天一样。现在，这个战斗比以前更加强有力，也更加激烈了。”
    告战斗者书说，“这种卑鄙的帝国主义诡计”是不能摧毁或削弱革命的。它宣布：“阿尔及利亚民族解放军有物质上和道义上的能力来继续斗争，直到我们达到永不改变的我们国家的目的，这就是宣布民族独立……”
