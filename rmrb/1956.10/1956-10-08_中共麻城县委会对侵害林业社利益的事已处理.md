In Response to Criticism

    The CCP Macheng County Committee Handles Infringement of Forestry Cooperative Interests
    On August 11th, this newspaper published a reader's letter titled "Two Oppressed Forestry Cooperatives," criticizing several government organs and enterprises for coercively requisitioning and underpaying for timber from the Qingfeng and Linfeng cooperatives in Macheng County, Hubei Province. The CCP Macheng County Committee has investigated and handled this matter. The County Committee stated in a letter dated September 9th: The criticisms raised in the letter are basically factual.
    I. The 275 telephone poles allocated to Qingfeng and Linfeng cooperatives were for erecting power lines in the Muzidian to Zhangjiabanqu area. The payment for this timber should be borne by the county. At the time, the county did not clearly explain this to the district, so the district allocated the task to the cooperatives, which was a mistake. It has now been decided that the County Finance Section will reasonably assess the price and compensate the two cooperatives, and make a self-criticism to the masses.
    II. The Muqi River Silkworm Cocoon Purchasing Station (written as Muqi River Silk Filature in the reader's letter) and the Macheng Construction Company successively ordered 600 fir trees from the two cooperatives last year and in March of this year. Among them, more than 400 trees were purchased by Ren Zhenghou, a staff member of the Muqi River Silkworm Cocoon Purchasing Station, at a price half that of the timber company's purchase price. The Muqi River Silkworm Cocoon Purchasing Station does not belong to our county. The Macheng County Committee has suggested to the Hubei Provincial Silk Company that it compensate the two cooperatives at the timber company's purchase price.
    III. Zhang Baozhong, District Chief of Zhangjiaban District, and Li Huiyuan, Deputy Secretary of the District Party Committee, committed the error of commandism in the allocation of telephone poles and the ordering of fir poles, creating a negative impact. They have been given an admonishment within the Party and instructed to make a written self-criticism to the two cooperatives.

### 中共麻城县委会对侵害林业社利益的事已处理

专栏：对批评的反应

    中共麻城县委会对侵害林业社利益的事已处理
    8月11日本报发表了题为“两个受摧残的林业合作社”的读者来信，批评了几个机关和企业向湖北麻城县青峰、林峰两合作社强迫征收和压价收购木材的行为。中共麻城县委会对于这件事已经进行了调查和处理。县委会在9月9日来信说：来信提出的批评基本符合事实。
    一、青峰、林峰等社摊派的电杆计二百七十五棵，是架设木子店至张家畈区的电线用的。这批木材的价款应由县支付。当时县没有向区交代清楚，区里便向合作社摊派，这是错误的。现已决定由县财政科合理作价，补偿给两个合作社，并向群众作检讨。
    二、木栖河蚕丝收购站（读者来信中写作木栖河缫丝厂）和麻城建筑公司在去年和今年三月，先后向两个合作社订购杉木六百棵，其中四百多棵是木栖河蚕丝收购站工作人员任正厚以比木材公司购价低一半的价格收购的。木栖河蚕丝收购站不属我县，麻城县委会已向湖北省丝绸公司建议按木材公司的购价补给两个社。
    三、张家畈区区长张保忠、区委副书记李会元两同志，在摊派电杆和订购杉杆中，犯了强迫命令的错误，造成了不良影响，在党内给他们以劝告处分，并责成他们向两个社作书面检讨。
