    "August 1st" Tractor Station Completed
    (Our report) The "August 1st" Agricultural Machine Tractor Station in Henan Province held its completion ceremony on September 23rd in Nianshang, Xuchang County, Henan. On that day, 5,000 people, including workers from Xuchang City, members of agricultural cooperatives within a dozen or so *li* around, and representatives from the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xuchang, participated in the celebration of the station's completion.
    The "August 1st" Agricultural Machine Tractor Station is one of the thirty agricultural machine tractor stations that officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army will save from their salaries and allowances and donate to between 1956 and 1958. During the station's preparation and construction, it received strong support from all sides. The leading organs of Henan Province allocated the newest tractors to them and equipped them with technically proficient personnel and outstanding cadres. Local farmers also competed to vacate their houses for the tractor station to use.
    According to the plan, the "August 1st" Tractor Station will have one hundred standard units, cultivating 400,000 *mu* of land, accounting for more than half of the arable land in Xuchang County. In order to put it into production as soon as possible, the station adopted the method of "building the station while producing." It officially began autumn plowing for farmers on September 24th. The plowed land is flat, straight, and deep. It is planned to complete 20,000 *mu* of autumn plowing within a month. (Zhu Hetang)

    “八一”拖拉机站建成
    本报讯　河南省“八一”农业机器拖拉机站9月23日在河南许昌县埝上举行了建站大会。这天，许昌市工人，周围十几里以内的农业合作社社员以及中国人民解放军驻许昌部队代表等五千余人参加了建站的庆祝大会。
    “八一”农业机器拖拉机站是中国人民解放军全体官兵要在1956年到1958年内节省薪金津贴集资捐献的三十个农业机器拖拉机站中的一个。这个站在筹建过程中，受到了各方面的大力支持，河南省的领导机关把最新的拖拉机调拨给它们，并配备了技术较高的人员和优秀的干部；当地的农民们也争着腾出自己的房屋让拖拉机站用。
    “八一”拖拉机站按规划有一百个标准台，代耕土地四十万亩，占许昌县可耕地的一半以上。为了早日投入生产，该站采取了“边生产，边建站”的方法，从9月24日起已正式替农民秋耕。耕过的土地又平又直又深。计划在一个月内完成两万亩秋耕任务。　（朱合堂）
