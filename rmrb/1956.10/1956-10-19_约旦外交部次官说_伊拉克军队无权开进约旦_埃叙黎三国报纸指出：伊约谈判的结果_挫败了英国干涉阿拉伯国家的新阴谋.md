    Xinhua News Agency, October 18th, Cairo Dispatch: Jordanian Deputy Foreign Minister Mazhar Gomaa, who is currently visiting Egypt, said in Cairo on October 16th that Iraqi troops have no right to enter Jordan to maintain internal order in Jordan.
    He told the press that Jordan has requested all Arab countries to provide military and financial assistance to "help us deal with Israeli aggression." He said, however, "We do not need anyone to help maintain domestic order."
    Xinhua News Agency, October 18th, Dispatch from TASS on October 17th: Egyptian, Syrian, and Lebanese newspapers commented on the communique of the Iraqi-Jordanian negotiations on military and political issues on the 17th, pointing out that this result not only proved to be a failure for the Iraqi government, but also a failure of a new British conspiracy against Arab countries.
    Egyptian newspapers' comments particularly pointed out that Iraqi troops could only enter Jordanian territory at the request of the Jordanian government. According to the Egyptian "Al-Gomhuria" newspaper, the Iraqi delegation had wanted Iraqi troops to be stationed in Jordan within the past week, intending to use this method to present a fait accompli to the new Jordanian parliament, which should be elected on October 21st.
    Syrian newspapers believe that although the Iraqi and Jordanian communiques stated that the negotiations were conducted "in a spirit of friendship, solidarity, and mutual understanding," the negotiations ultimately failed due to deep differences between the two sides.
    Lebanese "Al Nida" pointed out that the Western countries' plan to allow Iraqi troops to enter Jordanian territory was not to resist Israel in the event that Israeli troops invaded Jordanian territory, but so that Western countries could interfere in "this Jordanian parliamentary election."

    约旦外交部次官说
    伊拉克军队无权开进约旦
    埃叙黎三国报纸指出：伊约谈判的结果
    挫败了英国干涉阿拉伯国家的新阴谋
    新华社18日讯　开罗消息：现在埃及访问的约旦外交部次官马扎特·戈玛10月16日在开罗说，伊拉克军队没有权利进入约旦来维持约旦的内部秩序。
    他对报界说，约旦已要求所有阿拉伯国家给予军事和财政援助来“帮助我们对付以色列的侵略”。他说，但是，“我们不需要任何人来帮助维持国内秩序”。
    据新华社18日讯　据塔斯社17日讯：埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩的报纸在17日评论伊拉克和约旦关于军事和政治问题的谈判公报时指出，这一结果不仅证明是伊拉克政府的失败，而且是英国对阿拉伯国家新阴谋的一次失败。
    埃及报纸的评论特别指出，只有在约旦政府的要求下，伊拉克军队才能进入约旦领土。据埃及“共和国报”说，伊拉克代表团曾经想使伊拉克军队能在最近一周内就进驻约旦，打算用这种办法使应当在10月21日选出的约旦新议会面对一个既成事实。
    叙利亚报纸认为，虽然伊拉克和约旦公报中说谈判是“本着友好团结和互相谅解的精神”进行的，但是由于双方有着深刻的分歧，谈判终告失败。
    黎巴嫩“邻人报”指出，西方国家订出让伊拉克军队进入约旦领土的计划，不是为了一旦以色列军队侵犯约旦领土的时候抵抗以色列，而是为了西方国家可以干预“这次约旦议会的选举”。
