Xinhua News Agency, Sofia: The Eighth Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Council, which began on September 27th, concluded its discussion on the reports by WFTU General Secretary Louis Saillant and WFTU Vice-President Diallo on the morning of October 2nd. A total of fifty-two people spoke during the discussion. All speakers endorsed the WFTU's activities to strive for unity in the ranks of the trade union movement. In their speeches, they also discussed the struggles of trade unions in their respective countries to defend the social and economic rights of working people and to oppose colonialism.

At the evening session on September 27th, Grigory, Vice-President of the WFTU and Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, delivered a speech. Grigory said that trade unions of all countries and the WFTU can and should play a significant role in further easing international tensions and improving international relations. The WFTU, expressing the wishes of working people, has been fighting to improve the conditions of working people, to strive for peace and disarmament, and to strive for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and has always supported the progressive forces and the movements of people in colonial and dependent countries against imperialism. Grigory then pointed out: It is regrettable that there are still forces opposing the cause of international cooperation among some trade union leaders in capitalist countries and in the leadership of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions. Due to the existence of these forces, the current trade unions are divided, which has greatly harmed the cause of striving for peace and the vital interests of working people. Grigory said that there are now many common tasks based on which the various international trade union organizations can establish consistent actions. For example, trade unions of all countries can reach an agreement on taking consistent action to stop the universal arms race and to use the funds released from it to improve the living standards of working people.

At the September 29th session, Alain Le Léap, General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labour of France, focused on the issue of striving for unity in the international trade union movement. He pointed out that out of 160 million trade union members, 140 million are united in the WFTU and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. It is necessary to strengthen contact and rapprochement between these two world trade union organizations. He said that some leaders in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions openly advocate unity. The time has come to convene a round table conference. On this day, Zhu Xuefan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, also spoke.

At the October 1st session, Marichi, Secretary of the "Movement for Trade Union Democracy and Independence" of Argentina, and Bossi, General Secretary of the International Federation of Agricultural and Forestry Workers' Unions, and other speakers unanimously emphasized that it is essential to unite all forces of the working class for the struggle for peace and for meeting the urgent demands of working people. Bek, the representative of Cameroon in Africa, and Shafi’a of Sudan pointed out in their speeches that the struggle of the working people in these countries to meet economic demands is inextricably linked to the struggle to completely eliminate colonialism.

The morning session on October 2nd adopted a congratulatory telegram to the Fourth Congress of the German Trade Union Federation. The telegram, on behalf of the 88 million working people participating in the WFTU, expressed solidarity with the struggle of the trade union organizations of the Federal Republic of Germany to shorten working hours, improve working conditions, strive for democratic freedom, and oppose the remilitarization of West Germany.

At the evening session on October 2nd, WFTU Secretary Cassady delivered a report "On Convening the Fourth World Trade Union Congress." He emphasized that the Fourth World Trade Union Congress, to be held next year, will become a congress of working people from all over the world.

    世界工联理事会结束关于赛扬报告的讨论
    各国代表赞成促进工会运动团结
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社索非亚讯：世界工会联合会理事会第八次会议自9月27日开始讨论世界工会联合会总书记赛扬和世界工会联合会副主席迪亚洛的报告到10月2日上午会议讨论结束。在讨论中发言的共有五十二人。在讨论时，所有发言的人都赞同世界工会联合会争取实现工会运动队伍团结的活动。他们在发言中还谈到了自己国家的工会为保卫劳动人民的社会经济权利和反对殖民主义而进行斗争的情况。
    在9月27日晚间会议上，世界工会联合会副主席、全苏工会中央理事会主席格里申讲了话。格里申说，各国工会和世界工会联合会可能而且应当在进一步缓和国际紧张局势和改善国际关系上面起重大的作用。世界工会联合会表达出劳动人民的愿望，一直在为改善劳动人民的处境、争取和平和裁减军备、争取禁止原子武器和氢武器而进行斗争，始终支持进步力量和殖民地国家和附属国人民反对帝国主义的运动。格里申接着指出：令人遗憾的是，目前在某些资本主义国家的工会领导中以及在国际自由工会联合会和基督教工会国际联合会的领导中还存在着反对国际合作事业的力量。由于这种力量的存在，目前的工会陷于分裂，这就使得争取和平和劳动人民切身利益的斗争事业遭到很大的损失。格里申说，现在有许多共同的任务，根据这些任务就可以建立各个国际工会组织的行动一致。例如，各国工会是可以就一致行动争取停止普遍军备竞赛、争取利用由此腾出来的资金改善劳动人民生活水平一事达成协议的。
    在9月29日会议上，法国总工会总书记弗拉商着重谈到了争取国际工会运动团结的问题。他指出，在一亿六千万工会会员中，有一亿四千万人团结在世界工会联合会和国际自由工会联合会中。有必要加强这两个世界性工会组织之间的接触和接近。他说，国际自由工会联合会中有些领导人公开主张团结。现在召开圆桌会议的时候已经到了。这一天，中华全国总工会副主席朱学范也讲了话。
    在10月1日会议上，阿根廷“争取工会民主与独立运动”联合会书记马里奇和农林工人工会国际总书记波西和其他的发言人都一致着重指出，团结工人阶级的一切力量，对于争取和平、争取满足劳动人民的迫切要求的斗争是十分必要的。非洲喀麦隆的代表贝克和苏丹的沙菲阿在发言中指出，这些国家劳动人民争取满足经济要求的斗争是同彻底消灭殖民主义的斗争不可分离地联系着的。
    10月2日上午会议通过了致西德工会联合会第四次代表大会的贺电。贺电代表参加世界工会联合会的八千八百万劳动人民，表示声援德意志联邦共和国工会组织的争取缩短工作时间、改善劳动条件、争取民主自由和反对西德重新军国主义化的斗争。
    在10月2日晚间会议上，世界工会联合会书记卡萨迪作了“关于召开第四次世界工会代表大会”的报告。他着重指出，在明年召开的第四次世界工会代表大会将成为全世界劳动人民的大会。
