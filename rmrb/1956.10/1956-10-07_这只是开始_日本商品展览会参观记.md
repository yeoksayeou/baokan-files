This is Just the Beginning
—A Visit to the Japanese Commodity Exhibition
By Our Correspondent Liu Shiping

October in Beijing is filled with an atmosphere of peace and friendship.

On the morning of the 6th, as you approached the ancient Xizhimen on your way to the Soviet Exhibition Center, you could see a light iron tower erected on the city gate tower through the misty morning. It was a television transmitter. The Japanese Commodity Exhibition, which opened on the afternoon of the 6th, used this ultra-shortwave communication equipment as a representative exhibit. During the three-week exhibition in the capital, it will use a television broadcasting van to film operas and ball games being performed in major theaters and stadiums in Beijing, and then broadcast various programs and exhibition information through this transmitter to 35 locations in the city's famous parks, cultural palaces, and institutions and schools.

Standing in front of the Soviet Exhibition Center, people looked at the golden characters "Peace" and "Friendship" written on the two red-painted doors and couldn't help but recall the various economic and cultural exhibitions held in this exhibition center by friendly countries such as the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Vietnam. However, it had never hosted an exhibition held by a country with a different system than ours. This time, hosting the Japanese Commodity Exhibition was a first. From this, one can also understand the truth that countries with different systems can coexist peacefully. At the same time, it makes people foresee that the relationship between China and Japan will gradually normalize in the near future with the efforts of the people of both countries. However, promoting economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries through this exhibition is only a beginning.

As we passed through the gates of peace and friendship and entered the industrial hall, the first thing that caught our eye was a set of pink, lace-nylon women's banquet dresses carefully designed by a Japanese women's clothing design expert. This was specially designed by Japanese female handicraft artist Chiyo Tanaka to express goodwill to Chinese women. She also hopes to exchange clothing design experiences with women in our country. There was also a specially made summer garment, a gift from Sadakichi Matsubara, who loves peace and Sino-Japanese friendship, to Guo Moruo, with a letter from his son, Fukuyo Matsubara. The letter roughly stated that when Guo Moruo visited Japan last year, he held a farewell banquet and invited Sadakichi Matsubara to attend. Upon receiving the letter, Matsubara jumped up with joy, preparing to attend the banquet. Unfortunately, at this moment, on the morning of December 20th last year, he suddenly suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and passed away ten days later, preventing him from ever attending the meeting. Before his death, he instructed his son to send the local products they made to Guo Moruo as a thank you. Fukuyo Matsubara sent a piece of clothing first, according to his father's will, and planned to send other things they made later. From this gift, people are reminded of an old Chinese saying, "A small gift conveys great affection."

Among the gifts displayed in this section, there were also 600 various human-shaped handicrafts woven by housewives, handicraft artists, and sewing and weaving workers in Tokyo, Osaka, Yokohama, and other places. These gifts were collected in a short period of two weeks. Regardless of the quality of the works, they were all collected for the exhibition and prepared to be sent to the All-China Women's Federation after the exhibition to express the goodwill of Japanese women to Chinese women. Among these various human-shaped woven objects, I saw a pair of chubby dolls, seemingly standing in a glass frame, smiling at the audience. Attached to them was a brief description, a handicraft made by a Japanese housewife named Shomei Mama. In the description, she wrote her wishes for the Chinese people: "This is Yukiko at the foot of Mount Fuji. Chinese friends, please cherish her for us. Yukiko sings really well. I wish you good health." Visitors, looking intently at the two short and fat Japanese dolls through a layer of glass, felt the same way as the producing mother, loving the two dolls, and laughing with the children's innocent feelings.

The sound of motors starting broke through the laughter, and the visitors then walked towards the main hall of the industrial hall. There were automatic lathes, telecommunications machinery, and various automatic and semi-automatic textile and printing machinery. Everyone knows that Japan is a relatively developed industrial country, especially its textile industry, which was once famous. One of the exhibits was a semi-automatic silk reeling machine, which is said to be relatively new among Japanese textile machines; however, there are more advanced automatic silk reeling machines. Because Japan is actually still under American occupation and its economy cannot be independent, it is restricted by embargo regulations. Unfortunately, it cannot be exhibited. Whenever the president of the Japanese Exhibition, Shozo Murata, and the head of the delegation, Eiichi Shukutani, talked about the level of modern Japanese industry, they expressed regret that these embargoed materials could not be exhibited.

Opposite the various automatic textile machines, among the printing machinery on display, a complete set of automatic type-casting and typesetting machines attracted attention. This was designed by a manufacturer in Osaka, one of Japan's industrial centers. There are more than 2,000 Chinese characters on a single character plate, which can be operated electrically for automatic type-casting and typesetting, and can also use radio waves for telephoto transmission. For example, if newspapers published in Beijing are printed in Shanghai and other places, paper patterns are not needed. As long as this machine is used, like sending a telegram, the automatically cast and typeset characters can be transmitted from here to there.

Upstairs in the industrial hall, in the western corridor, various modern Japanese optical instruments are displayed, including film projectors, cameras, microscopes, telescopes, as well as measuring, chemical, and medical instruments. The southern corridor focuses on displaying Japanese plastic industry and synthetic fiber industry products, as well as typewriters and calculators. Among them, the various insulating plastic products made of vinyl chloride and the various daily necessities made of synthetic fibers are attractive. Turning to the eastern corridor, there are mostly rubber products and local products from various parts of Japan. Among them, nylon socks and sponge table tennis rackets from Nara Prefecture were praised by the audience.

In the passages on both sides of the industrial hall, there were also specially made Japanese bicycles, motorcycles, automobile parts, and food machinery on display.

Outside the industrial hall, in the western square, there were three-wheeled vehicles that we often see on the streets of Beijing. This year alone, our country imported 1,500 of these small cargo trucks from Japan. There is a Matsuda children's car, a sample car specially designed by an engineer at Matsuda Works, Orita, in response to our country's needs, which will be mass-produced in the future. This type of three-wheeled vehicle can be used by kindergartens and elementary schools to pick up and drop off children. There is also a refrigerated three-wheeled vehicle, similar to an ambulance, which was also custom-made for our country's needs. It uses ice to refrigerate and transport food in the summer, keeping the food fresh and preventing spoilage. In the square, there were also wheeled and crawler tractors, D80 bulldozers, forklift trucks, automatic dump trucks, graders, and other machinery for industrial and agricultural production produced by Komatsu Manufacturing. This manufacturer used to manufacture munitions exclusively for the American aggressors. Due to changes in the international situation and international market, in order to adapt to the needs of the international market and its own interests, it could not but produce bulldozers and tractors.

Across from the industrial hall, the eastern square has various agricultural tools and machines for rice milling, threshing, and oil extraction, as well as various powdering, fumigating, and spraying machines for killing crop pests and diseases. Seeing this, there is an interlude that fully illustrates that the future of Sino-Japanese trade is very broad. This is an article written by Akio Nomura of the World Economy Research Institute, published in the International News, titled "Breaking Away from the Subordinate Economy Leaning Towards the United States." When he talked about the future of Sino-Japanese trade, he cited the following example: "Not long ago, China National Transportation Machinery Import Corporation ordered 70,000 sprayers from Japan through Wakou Corporation for a total amount of approximately 560 million yen. This amount is equivalent to Japan's total annual export of agricultural implements." Therefore, based on vivid facts, Akio Nomura forcefully stated: "Only China can place such large orders. From this example, we can see that the future of Sino-Japanese trade is limitless."

Adjacent to the eastern square, entering the agricultural hall. On the left side of the entrance is an electric incubator, which is said to be able to hatch 17,000 chicks at a time; on the right is a fishing net woven with nylon, as well as a new type of fish finder and a model of a fishing boat. This illustrates that Japan is a coastal island nation, and the fishing industry is relatively developed, and the shipbuilding industry also has a certain level. In this hall, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and various internal combustion engines and other machinery are also displayed.

Passing through the central hall from the agricultural hall, opposite is the daily necessities hall. This hall mainly includes two parts: one part is Japanese chemical fiber industry products (including rayon, artificial fiber, synthetic fiber, and other textiles) that are famous in the world, and the other part is children's toys, stationery, cosmetics, lacquerware and furniture for home decoration, sewing machines and clocks, radios, as well as some medical equipment and medicines.

Among the exhibits of the chemical fiber industry, we can see the considerable development of Japanese nylon products. You can see nylon shirts, handkerchiefs, scarves, clothing materials, and various daily necessities in this part of the exhibits. You can also see various woolens, serges, and gabardines and other woolen yarns and clothing materials made of Japanese artificial fibers and synthetic fibers.

The reason why Japan's chemical fiber industry can be developed, as described in "China's Economic Construction and Japan's Chemical Fiber Industry" published in the International News, which introduces the evolution and current situation of the chemical fiber industry, is that this is an emerging industry in Japan, and the reason why it can develop so rapidly "is the result of exports to neighboring countries, primarily China."

Indeed, from the beginning of the exhibition, we can see how enthusiastically the people of the capital support and welcome this Japanese Commodity Exhibition. People believe that this is only the beginning. In the future, with the joint efforts of the people of both countries, the trade relations between China and Japan will definitely gradually move towards normalization.

    这只是开始
    ——日本商品展览会参观记
    本报记者　刘时平
    10月里的北京，到处洋溢着和平友谊的气氛。
    6日早晨，当你去苏联展览馆时，走近古老的西直门，从晨雾迷漫中，你就可以看到一座轻巧的铁塔架在城门楼上，那是电视发射台，在6日下午开幕的日本商品展览会把这种超短波通讯器材当作代表展品，将在首都历时三周的展出期间，利用电视广播车，活动到北京各大戏院和体育场拍摄正在上演的歌剧和球赛，然后通过这个发射台在市内著名的公园、文化宫和机关、学校等三十五处转播各种节目和展览会的情况。
    走到苏联展览馆门前，人们看着在两扇红油漆大门上写的“和平”、“友谊”四个金黄色大字，不禁回忆起过去在这个展览馆中，曾经接待过苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和越南等友邦国家举行的各种交流经济和文化的展览会；但是还没有接待过一个和我们不同制度的国家在这里举办展览会。这次接待日本商品展览会还是第一次。从这里也可以使人体会到不同制度的国家可以和平共处的真理，同时也使人们预感到中日两国的关系，在不久的将来，在两国人民的努力下，一定可以逐渐走向正常化。但是，通过这次展览会促进两国的经济和文化交流，这只是一个开始。
    当我们通过和平友谊的大门，进入工业馆。首先印入眼帘的是一个日本妇女服装设计专家精心设计的一套粉红色的、用花边尼龙做的女宴会服，这是日本女手工艺家田中千代为了表示对中国妇女的亲善，专门设计出来的。她还希望同我国的妇女交流服装设计的经验。在那里，还有一件用手工特制的夏季衣裳，那是一位热爱和平和中日友谊的松原定吉送给郭沫若的礼物，并附有他的儿子松原福与的一封来信，信中的内容大意是说，郭沫若在去年访问日本时，曾经在告别时举行过一次宴会，邀请松原定吉参加，松原收到信后，高兴的跳起来，准备去参加宴会。遗憾的是，就在这个时候，在去年12月20日午前，他突患脑溢血病，隔十天后，与世长绝，使他永远不能赴会。临死前，他嘱咐他的儿子把他们制作的土产物送给郭沫若，作为答谢。松原福与根据他父亲的遗嘱先送来一件衣裳，准备以后还要送来他们制作的其他东西。从这件礼物中，使人们想到中国的一句老话，真是“礼轻人义重”。
    在这部分陈列的礼物中，还有东京、大阪、横滨等地的家庭妇女、手工艺家和缝纫、编织工人编织的各种人形手工艺品六百件。这些礼物是在两个礼拜内的短促时间内集中起来的。她们不管作品的好坏，都收集到展览会来，准备在展览完后，送给中国民主妇女联合会，作为表达日本妇女对中国妇女的亲善心愿。我在这些形形色色的人形编织物中，看到一对小胖娃娃，好像是站在玻璃框内，面对着观众喜笑颜开，在他们身上贴的有一个简短的说明书，那是一个书名妈妈的日本家庭妇女亲手制作的手工艺品，在说明中写下了她对中国人民的愿望：“这个是富士山的山脚的雪子，中国的朋友们，请替我们好好儿的可爱它吧，雪子唱的真是不错，祝你们健康。”参观的人们透过一层玻璃，凝神看着那两个又矮又胖的日本娃娃，都和这位制作的妈妈有同样的感情，喜爱着那两个娃娃，并和孩子们的天真感情一样笑起来了。
    机器开动的马达声，冲破了人们的笑声，接着参观的人们走向工业馆的正厅。那儿有自动化的车床、电讯机械和各种自动、半自动的纺织、印刷机械。人们都知道日本是一个工业比较发达的国家，特别是纺织工业，曾经驰名一时。展品中有一件半自动化的缫丝机，在日本的纺织机械中，据说是比较新式的；可是还有比这部机器进步的自动化缫丝机，由于日本实际上还处在美国的占领下，经济不能独立自主，受了禁运条例的限制，可惜不能展出，当日本展览会的总裁村田省藏和团长宿谷荣一等每逢谈到日本的现代工业水平时，就为这些被禁运的物资不能展出而表示遗憾。
    在各种自动纺织机的对面陈列的印刷机械中，引人注目的是一套完整的自动铸排机，这是日本工业中心之一——大阪的一家厂商设计的。在一个文字盘上有两千多个汉字，可以用电力操作自动铸字、排字，也可以利用电波传真。例如北京出版的报纸，在上海等地印刷，可以不用纸型，只要利用这种机器，就像发电报一样，把自动铸排的字型，从此地传真到彼地。
    工业馆的楼上，在西边长廊上陈列着日本近代化的各种光学仪器，有电影机、照像机、显微镜、望远镜，还有测量、化工和医疗器械。南廊上集中展出日本的塑胶工业和合成纤维工业的制品，还有打字机和计算器等机械。其中吸引人的是用氯化乙烯制成的各种绝缘体的塑胶产品和合成纤维制成的各种日用品。转弯到了东廊上，多为橡胶制品和日本各地方的土产品，其中奈良县的尼龙袜子和海绵乒乓球拍，受到了观众的称道。
    在工业馆的两侧过道上，还展出了日本特制的自行车、机器脚踏车和汽车零件、食品机械等。
    出了工业馆，在西广场上，有我们在北京街头常看到的三轮汽车，这种小型的运输货车光在今年内，我国就从日本进口了一千五百辆。有一种松田儿童车，是松田制作所的一位技术人员织田应我国的需要，专门设计的一部样品车，将来准备大量生产。这种三轮汽车可供幼儿园和小学接送小孩用。还有一种冷藏三轮汽车，就像是救护车，也是为我国的需要定做的，夏季用冰冷藏运送食物，可以使食物保持新鲜，不致腐烂。在广场上，还有小松制作所出产的轮式和履带拖拉机、D80型推土机、叉式起重机、自动倾卸车，平地机等工农业生产用的机械。这个制作所过去专为美国侵略者制造军火，由于国际形势和国际市场的变化，为了适应国际市场的需要和本身的利益，它也不能不生产推土机和拖拉机了。
    隔着工业馆，对面的东广场，是各种农具和辗米、打谷、榨油的机器，还有杀害农作物病虫害的各种撒粉、烟雾、喷雾机。看到这里，有一段插曲，充分说明中日贸易的前途是十分广阔的。这是在日本出版的国际新闻报上登载的世界经济研究所野村昭夫写的一篇文章，题为
  “摆脱向美国一边倒的从属经济”，他谈到中日贸易前途时，引证了下面一个例子：“在不久之前，中国运输机械进口公司经和光株式会社交易，以总额约五亿六千万日元向日本订购喷雾器七万件，这金额相当日本一年间全部农具的出口总额。”因此，野村昭夫根据活生生的事实，有力地说明：“唯有中国才能有如此大量的订购。由这一例子看来，就可知道中日贸易的前途是无可限量的。”
    紧接着东广场，走进农业馆。一进门的左边是一部电气孵卵器，据说一次可以孵出一万七千只小鸡；右边是用尼龙织的捕渔网，还有一部新式的渔群探知机和渔船的模形，这里说明日本是一个沿海的岛国，渔业是比较发达的，造船工业也有一定的水平。在这个馆内，还展出了化学肥料、农药和各种内燃机等机械。
    从农业馆通过中央大厅，对面是生活用品馆。在这个馆里主要包括两部分，一部分是日本在世界驰名的化学纤维工业制品（包括人造丝、人造纤维、合成纤维等纺织品），另外一部分是儿童玩具、文具、化妆用品、家庭摆设的漆器和家具、缝纫机和钟表、收音机，以及一部分医疗器械和药品。
    在化学纤维工业的展品中，我们可以看到日本尼龙制品相当发达的情况，你可以在这部分展品中看到尼龙衬衫、手绢、头巾、衣料和各种生活日用品，也可以看到日本人造纤维和合成纤维所制成的各种呢绒、哔叽和嘎毕丁等毛线和衣料。
    日本的化学纤维工业所以能够得到发展，正如国际新闻上所载的“中国经济建设与日本的化学纤维工业”中介绍化学纤维工业的沿革及现状中所说，这是日本的一个新兴的工业，它所以能够这样迅速发展，“是向以中国为首的近邻各国出口的结果。”
    的确，从展览会的开始，我们就可以看到首都人民是如何热情地支持并欢迎这次日本商品展览会。人们都相信，这只是一个开始，今后在两国人民的共同努力争取下，中日两国的贸易关系，一定可以逐步走向正常化。
