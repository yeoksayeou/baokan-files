    Happiness Road Agricultural Cooperative Overcomes Four Floods
    96% of Members Increase Income
    (Our Dispatch) The Happiness Road Agricultural Cooperative in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, although hit by four floods this year, still saw 96% of its members increase their income.
    The autumn harvest is now underway throughout the cooperative. More than a hundred iron-wheeled and rubber-tired carts are leaving the cultivated areas, fully loaded with crops. Over a hundred female members are stripping corn and gleaning crops in the fields near the village. Tractors have already begun plowing the land. Work on farmland water conservancy is also proceeding intensely. The cooperative's director, Han En, said: "We want to tell our dear friends, the members of the Thalmann Agricultural Production Cooperative in the German Democratic Republic, that although we suffered floods and reduced production this year, we have still increased our income." This spring, this cooperative and the Thalmann Agricultural Production Cooperative launched an international friendship competition, fervently striving to achieve the conditions of the competition. However, unexpectedly, from spring plowing to summer weeding, they were continuously hit by four floods. The members actively fought against the floods. On August 7th, it rained heavily for a day and a night; the next day, the river swelled, and the water on the flat ground reached three feet deep. The members immediately rushed to repair a one-kilometer-long levee, which protected more than twenty hectares of paddy fields. At the same time, the members also raised up clump by clump more than fifty hectares of rice plants buried in the mud. Thanks to the members' active efforts to reduce the affected area and strengthen field management, the cooperative's agricultural production plan for this year can still be nearly completed. To compensate for the poor agricultural harvest, the cooperative also vigorously developed sideline production. The Korean members of the cooperative did not know how to raise pigs, so the Han members taught them by apprenticing them. The cooperative also paid attention to letting the members themselves engage in more than ten sideline production activities such as picking mushrooms and digging medicinal materials, to support their family sideline occupations. By September of this year, the cooperative's income from sideline production had reached more than 34,000 yuan, an increase of twelve times compared to last year. This greatly increased the income of the members. Of the 688 member households in the cooperative, 96% of the members increased their income compared to last year, 20 households had the same income, and only six households had a slight decrease in income.

    幸福之路农业社战胜四次水灾
    百分之九十六的社员增加收入
    本报讯　吉林蛟河县幸福之路农业合作社今年虽遭遇四次水灾，但全社96％的社员仍然增加了收入。
    现在全社正在秋收。一百多辆铁车和胶轮车，满载庄稼开出耕作区。一百多名女社员在村旁田地里扒苞米、拣庄稼。拖拉机已开始翻地。兴修农田水利的工作，也在紧张地进行。这个社的主任韩恩说：“我们要告诉亲爱的朋友——德意志民主共和国台尔曼农业生产合作社社员们，今年我们虽然遭了水灾，减了产，但我们还增加了收入。”今年春天，这个社和台尔曼农业生产合作社展开国际友谊比赛，热烈地为实现竞赛的条件而奋斗。但是不料春耕到夏锄，连续遭到四次水灾。社员们积极向水灾作斗争。8月7日，下了一天一夜的大雨；第二天河水暴涨，平地的水深达三尺。社员们立即抢修成一条一公里长的水堤，才保住了二十多公顷水田。同时社员们还把埋在污泥中的五十多公顷水稻，一簇簇地扶起来。由于社员们积极缩小灾害面积，加强田间管理，今年全社农业生产计划仍能接近完成。为了弥补农业生产的歉收，全社又大力开展副业生产。社内朝鲜族社员不会养猪，汉族社员就用带徒弟的办法教会他们。这个合作社也注意社里把采蘑菇、挖药材等十多项副业生产，交给社员自己去搞，以支持他们的家庭副业。到今年9月份，全社副业生产的收入已达三万四千多元，比去年增加十二倍。这样就大大增加了社员的收入。全社有六百八十八户社员，有96％的社员比去年增加收入，有二十户社员不增不减，只有六户社员的收入略有减少。
