    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 15th - Jiangsu Province is conducting water conservancy planning by dividing areas according to natural conditions, in order to comprehensively develop farmland water conservancy projects, so that water conservancy projects invested in by the state and agricultural cooperatives can be carried out in a planned manner, and fully exert the due effectiveness of various projects.
    According to the characteristics of the province's terrain, rivers, and the situation of water and drought disasters over the years, the water conservancy planning divided into areas divides the province into twenty-five regions. For example, the Taihu Lake basin, the western region has a higher terrain and is prone to drought, while the eastern region has a lower terrain and is prone to flooding. Now it is divided into two regions, the west of the lake and the east of the lake, and the overall water conservancy construction planning of these two regions is carried out according to the characteristics of irrigation and drainage respectively. The Qinhuai River, which belongs to the Zhenjiang mountainous area, is short in its source and flows rapidly. Mountain floods rise and fall sharply, often threatening 1.95 million mu of farmland on both sides of the river. Now it is designated as a region focusing on flood control. Other regions are also divided into separate areas according to the characteristics of coastal, lakeside, riverside, Jiangxinzhou land or mountainous areas for planning.
    In order to carry out this work, the Jiangsu Provincial Water Conservancy Department has dispatched a group of technical personnel to sort out the old water conservancy data, cooperate with the water conservancy cadres of various special zones and counties to investigate the hydrology, geology, soil and socio-economic conditions of various places, conduct in-depth visits to experienced farmers, and then conduct comparative research to make relevant regional water conservancy planning drafts. At present, the regional water conservancy planning work in eight regions including the west of Taihu Lake and Lixiahe has been completed, and the investigation work in the Qinhuai River basin and north of the irrigation main canal will also be completed around the end of this year.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanba, 15th - The area of autumn water storage irrigation in the Hetao Irrigation Area of Inner Mongolia this year will be expanded by more than 280,000 mu compared with last year. By the beginning of October, about 3 million mu of summer and autumn stubble land had been irrigated in the entire irrigation area, and it is expected that 1.5 million mu can be irrigated before freezing.
    The Hetao Plain has always had little rainfall and a dry climate. The average annual rainfall is about 200 mm, and various crops have the characteristic of "not growing without irrigation". Therefore, autumn water storage irrigation has always been the main measure for farmers of all ethnic groups here to ensure increased production. This year, after cooperativization, farmers of all ethnic groups have paid more attention to autumn irrigation work. Now, in addition to leveling the land, building dikes, and rushing to irrigate farmland, they are also stepping up the organization of plows to carry out tillage and harrowing on the irrigated land to conserve moisture.

    江苏省按照自然条件进行水利规划
    内蒙古河套区扩大秋灌面积
    新华社南京15日电　江苏省正在按照自然条件分区进行水利规划，以便全面开展农田水利事业，使国家投资兴修的和农业社投资兴修的水利工程，都能有计划地进行，并充分发挥各项工程应有的效力。
    根据全省地形、河流、历年水旱灾害情况的特点，分区进行的水利规划把全省划分为二十五个地区。如太湖流域，西部地区地势较高，容易受旱，东部地区地势较低，容易受涝，现在划分为湖西、湖东两个地区，分别按照灌溉和排涝两个特点，进行这两个地区的全面水利建设规划。属于镇江山区的秦淮河，由于源短流急，山洪暴涨暴落，经常威胁着两岸一百九十五万亩农田，现在划为一个以防洪为主的地区。其他地区也都按照沿海、沿湖、沿河、江心洲地或多山等特点，单独划分区域，进行规划。
    为了进行这一工作，江苏省水利厅曾调派了一批技术人员，整理旧有的水利资料，配合各专区、县的水利干部调查各地水文、地质、土壤和社会经济情况，深入访问有经验的农民，再经过比较研究，作出有关地区的水利规划草案。现在太湖湖西、里下河等八个地区的地区水利规划工作已经完成，秦淮河流域、灌溉总渠以北等地区的调查工作在今年年底前后也将完成。
    新华社陕坝15日电　内蒙古河套灌溉区今年秋季储水灌溉的面积将比去年扩大二十八万多亩。到10月上旬，全灌溉区已浇过夏、秋茬地约三百万亩，预计封冻前还能灌溉一百五十万亩。
    河套平原一向雨量稀少，气候干燥。每年平均降雨量在二百公厘左右，各种农作物有“不浇不长”的特点。因此，秋季储水灌溉一向是这里各族农民保证增产的主要措施。今年合作化后，各族农民对秋浇工作更为重视，现在除整地打堰、抢浇农田外，并加紧组织犁杖在已浇过的土地上进行耕耙保墒工作。
