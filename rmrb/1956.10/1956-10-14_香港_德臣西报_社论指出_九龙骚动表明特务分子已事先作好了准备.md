Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th. The Hong Kong "China Mail" published an editorial on the 12th entitled "The Kowloon Disturbances," saying: "The blame lies entirely with those political extremists who were determined to turn a festival into a wild riot. Furthermore, the way the riots developed shows that preparations had been made in advance."
The editorial said: "Nothing can serve as a reason or excuse for the shameful behavior of the thugs and hooligans who have been engaged in intimidation, arson, and robbery in Kowloon for the past two days."
The editorial pointed out: "This is not the first time these elements have incited riots in this colony, and they constitute a constant threat to the peace and tranquility of Hong Kong. The strongest measures need to be taken to suppress them."
