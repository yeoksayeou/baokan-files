The Baicheng area of ​​Jilin Province is an area that combines agriculture and animal husbandry. The total area of ​​the district is 4.2 million hectares, including 1 million hectares of grassland, which has good conditions for developing animal husbandry. There are currently 620,000 head of large livestock and 620,000 sheep and pigs. The masses have always had experience and interest in operating animal husbandry, calling animal husbandry "iron crops," "money trees," and "sons for old age." Since liberation, the general trend of animal husbandry has been development, and the absolute number of livestock has increased. However, according to a recent survey, the number of livestock has decreased compared with the census in 1955: horses decreased by 9%, cattle decreased by 3.5%, and pigs decreased by 20%. Only sheep increased by 24%.

Why has the number of livestock decreased?

From the perspective of leadership, in the great development of agricultural production cooperatives, our understanding of the issue of pricing livestock for collective ownership, the most important issue related to changing ownership, was insufficient, and publicity and education were insufficient. This led to the livestock owners' ideological turmoil before the pricing of livestock for collective ownership by the cooperative. They did not care about feeding and management. After the livestock was priced and belonged to the collective, due to poor centralized feeding management, the livestock did not eat well, drink well, live well, and disease prevention and control was not good. If this situation is not resolved, it will inevitably affect the development of animal husbandry. After discovering these problems, we immediately took some measures. Regarding livestock pricing, we adhered to the principle of being slightly higher than the market price. The problem of blindly concentrating livestock was very serious, so we resolutely advocated that agricultural production teams should be the units, and the livestock should be fed and managed in groups, fields, and pens according to the type, sex, age, and quality of the livestock. We also summarized and absorbed the experience of state-owned farms and the masses in improving livestock breeds, actively selected local fine breeds, and came up with many ways to introduce fine breeds from other places and foreign countries for improvement, especially doing a good job in artificial insemination of horses and sheep, which has achieved good results, and the improved livestock is of high value. These measures have curbed the death of livestock and enhanced the physique of livestock. Now we are vigorously studying and arranging the feeding and management of livestock for safe wintering, solving the planning of grassland feed, improving livestock quality, and the overall planning of animal husbandry.

From the perspective of the Baicheng area, to further develop animal husbandry in the future, it is also necessary to solve the problem of excessively low livestock prices. Last year, the price of livestock plummeted, which greatly dampened the enthusiasm of the masses to engage in animal husbandry. This was an important reason for the thinness and death of livestock last winter and this spring, and it is also the main contradiction in the current development of animal husbandry.

In 1953, agricultural production had a bumper harvest, and the masses competed to buy livestock. The price of livestock once soared. A horse was worth an average of 360 yuan, which was of course a bit high and unreasonable. In 1954, each horse fell to 250 yuan, although it was still slightly higher, it was close to stable and reasonable. In the winter of 1955 and the spring of this year, the price of livestock plummeted again, and horses fell to 110 yuan per head. The purchase price of cattle also decreased this spring, but the slaughter tax increased by 5% on the basis of 13%, which is unreasonable. The cost of a horse is 193 yuan, but it is only sold for about 100 yuan. A cow can produce 240 catties of pure meat, worth 108 yuan, with a cost of about 70 yuan, but the state's purchase price is only 42 yuan. The masses reflected that "draft cattle are not as valuable as beef cattle, and live cattle are not as valuable as dead cattle." Some county cooperatives spent 80 yuan in March to buy two draft cattle, which died, and the skin and meat were sold for a total of 132 yuan. A fat pig that produces 150 catties of meat is worth 75 yuan for the meat alone, with a cost of 39 yuan, but the purchase price is only 45 yuan, which is also relatively low. The masses have a lot of opinions on the method of purchasing by estimating the skin and judging the meat, saying that "grabbing a handful, kicking a foot, and glancing at it" "would rather estimate less than let it run away" is a "unique acquisition method of 'taking people'." Pressing grades, pressing scales, and pressing prices are common phenomena. Some cattle were estimated to be worth 58 yuan, but were sold for 110 yuan elsewhere. The acquisition technicians also reflected that they were not very accurate in estimating. They said, "Whose elbow is turned outwards?" Many people sold mares and cows last winter, and the food company also slaughtered many calves. When a donkey was hit and killed by a train, the owner not only did not ask for compensation, but also sincerely thanked him. When a donkey broke its leg, the ignorant son was very scared, but the sensible father laughed happily. Some livestock owners put a note on the donkey saying "Please find your own convenience."

Why are livestock prices so low? The main reason is that there are too many circulation links in the procurement, sales, and slaughter departments, the costs are too high, the gross profit reaches more than 100%, and the net profit reaches 16% (the legal profit is 4%). The tax rate is also relatively high. The standards for controlling draft cattle, beef cattle, and slaughter and elimination are too strict, and the masses feel that raising livestock is unprofitable and inconvenient. Some people said: "The old, weak, sick, and disabled are outdated, they cannot be sold and are not allowed to be slaughtered, it is a waste of effort and fodder, just like the old man raised at home!"

In order to develop animal husbandry production, we believe that the commercial departments must correctly grasp the price policy. Excessively high livestock prices are unreasonable, but if the prices are too low, it will hinder the development of animal husbandry and will not be able to meet the needs of industrial development and people's lives. At the same time, we must reduce circulation links, reduce circulation costs, and profits should not be too high. The unreasonable method of estimating the skin and judging the meat must be changed, and the acquisition method of weighing, grading, and giving fair prices should be adopted. Prices should be appropriately increased and taxes reduced, and effective measures should be taken to support the development of animal husbandry production, such as investment, loans, assistance in solving the problem of improved breeds, and training animal husbandry technical cadres. Relevant departments should adhere to the overall perspective of developing animal husbandry, promoting agriculture, supporting industry, and meeting the growing needs of the people for animal husbandry products, and complete their own procurement, sales, slaughter, tax collection, and other tasks by supporting the development of animal husbandry. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership over these departments, educate the cadres of these departments, enhance the mass perspective, and overcome the ideological style of subjectivism and bureaucracy. Because this issue involves a wide range, we hope that relevant departments will consider and study it, take effective measures, and actively solve it.

### 白城地区发展畜牧业的障碍在那里

    白城地区发展畜牧业的障碍在那里
    中共白城地委书记　赵子平
    吉林省白城专区是一个农牧结合的地区，全区总面积四百二十万公顷，内有草原一百万公顷，有着发展畜牧业的良好条件。现有大牲畜六十二万头，羊、猪六十二万只。群众向来有经营畜牧业的经验和兴趣，把畜牧业叫“铁杆庄稼”、“摇钱树”、“养老儿子”。解放以后畜牧业总的趋势是发展的，牲畜的绝对数字是增长的。但是，据最近调查，牲畜数目较一九五五年普查时有所减少：马减少百分之九，牛减少百分之三点五，猪减少百分之二十。只有羊增加了百分之二十四。
    牲畜为什么减少了呢？
    从领导上来讲，在农业生产合作社的大发展中，我们对于牲畜作价归集体所有这个关系到改变所有制的最主要的问题认识不够，宣传教育不够，致使在作价归合作社集体所有以前，畜主思想动荡，不经心饲养经管；在作价归社以后，由于集中饲养管理不善，牲畜吃不好，喝不好，住不好，疫病防治不好。这种情况如不解决势必影响畜牧业的发展。发现这些问题以后，我们即采取了一些措施。如牲畜作价，我们掌握着稍高于市价的原则。牲畜盲目集中问题很大，就坚决提倡以农业生产队为单位，按牲畜的种别、性别、年龄、优劣，分群、分场、分圈饲养管理。我们也总结和吸收了国营牧场的和群众的改良牲畜品种的经验，积极挑选本地良种，并想了许多办法，引进外地和外国的良种，进行改良，特别是搞好马、羊的人工授精工作，收效良好，改良的牲畜价值很高。采取了这些措施，就制止了牲畜的死亡，增强了牲畜的体质。现在我们正在大力研究布置牲畜安全过冬的饲养管理工作，解决草原饲料的规划和提高牲畜质量以及畜牧业的全面规划等问题。
    从白城地区看，今后要进一步发展畜牧业，还必须解决牲畜价格过低的问题。去年牲畜价格猛跌，大大挫伤了群众经营畜牧业的积极性。这是去冬今春牲畜瘦弱和死亡的重要原因，也是目前畜牧业发展中的主要矛盾。
    一九五三年农业生产丰收，群众都争买牲畜，牲畜价格曾经一度猛涨，一匹马平均值三百六十元，这当然也是高了一些，不够合理。一九五四年每匹马落到二百五十元，虽然还稍高一点，但已接近平稳合理了。一九五五年冬和今年春季牲畜价格又暴跌，马落到一百一十元一匹。牛的收购价格今春也降低了，但屠宰税却在百分之十三的基础上又增加了百分之五，这就不合理了。马一匹的成本是一百九十三元，只卖百元左右。一头牛能出二百四十斤净肉，值一百○八元，成本费七十元左右，国家的收购价格只四十二元。群众反映说：“耕牛不如菜牛值钱，活牛不如死牛值钱”。有的县社三月间花八十元买二头耕牛，死了，皮肉共卖一百三十二元。出一百五十斤肉的肥猪，光肉值七十五元，成本费三十九元，收购价只有四十五元，也比较低。群众对估皮断肉的收购办法很有意见，说是“抓一把，踢一脚，望一眼”“宁估少了，别估跑了”是“独一份的‘拿人’的收购办法”。压等、压秤、压价是普遍的现象。有的一头牛估成五十八元，到别处卖了一百一十元。收购的技术员也反映估不太准，他们说“谁的胳膊肘往外拧？”去年冬季卖母马母牛的很多，食品公司也宰出不少牛犊。毛驴被火车撞死，畜主不但不叫赔，还衷心地感谢呢。毛驴断了腿，不懂事的儿子很害怕，懂事的父亲却高兴的笑起来。有的畜主在驴身上贴了“请自找方便”的条子。
    为什么牲畜价格这么低呢？主要原因就是收购、推销、宰杀部门的流转环节太多，费用过大，毛利达百分之一百以上，纯利达到百分之十六（合法利润是百分之四）。税率也比较高。对于耕牛、菜牛和宰杀淘汰的标准控制的过严过死，群众感到养牲畜无利还不方便。有的人说：“老弱病残过时了，不能卖又不准杀，白下工夫又把草料搭，好像老爷子养在家！”
    为了发展畜牧业生产，我们觉得商业部门必须正确掌握价格政策。牲畜价格过高是不合理的，但是如果价格过低，就会妨碍畜牧业的发展，不能满足工业发展和人民生活的需要。同时必须减少流转环节，降低流转费用，利润不应太高。不合理的估皮断肉的办法必须改变，改用过秤评等公平给价的收购办法。应适当地提价减税，并采取一些有效措施支持牧畜业生产的发展，如投资、贷款、帮助解决优良畜种，培养牧畜技术干部等。有关部门要本着发展畜牧业，促进农业，支援工业，满足人民对畜牧产品日益增长的需要的全面观点，从支持畜牧业的发展中，来完成自己收购、推销、宰杀、收税等任务。因此，必须加强党对这些部门的领导，教育这些部门的干部，增强群众观点，克服主观主义与官僚主义的思想作风。因为这个问题，牵扯的面较广，希望有关部门考虑研究，采取有效措施，积极加以解决。
