Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, October 10th. Agricultural production cooperatives in Shandong Province are, in order to maximize the effectiveness of farmland water conservancy projects and expand the area of winter irrigation, leveling land and constructing ditches in conjunction with autumn harvesting and planting. According to statistics from sixty counties including Gaotang, Yanggu, Cao County, Junan, and Linyi, over 4.2 million mu of land in areas with water wells has been leveled and ditched since the start of the autumn harvest.

Since the autumn of last year, Shandong Province has dug many new wells. However, in many areas, the wells have not been fully utilized because attention was not paid to combining well digging with land leveling and ditch construction. To learn from this lesson, water conservancy departments in various regions are now adopting methods such as organizing visits, summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, and sending cadres to rural areas to provide specific guidance, to promote the progress of land leveling and ditch construction. After sending water conservancy technical cadres to townships and cooperatives to assist and guide, and organizing visits, counties such as Guanxian, Qihe, Pingyuan, and Yanggu have achieved success in land leveling and ditch construction. The land that has now been leveled in these areas accounts for more than half of the area that should be irrigated by the wells. In addition, many agricultural cooperatives, while leveling land, have also repaired some of the wells that were damaged by floods during the rainy season. Of the 14,900 wells in the Heze and Liaocheng regions that were damaged by floods in the summer and autumn seasons, not only have most been repaired, but many wells have also had their platforms raised.

### 山东平地整畦扩大冬浇面积

    山东平地整畦扩大冬浇面积
    新华社济南10日电　山东省各地农业生产合作社为发挥农田水利工程的作用，扩大冬浇面积，在秋收秋种的同时，结合进行平地整畦工作。据高唐、阳谷、曹县、莒南、临沂等六十个县的统计，自秋收开始以来，已在有水井的农田里平地整畦四百二十多万亩。
    山东省从去年秋季以后，曾打了许多新井，但是，有不少地区因为在打井时没有注意结合平地整畦工作，致使许多水井没有得到充分利用。各地水利部门为接受这一教训，现在正采取组织参观、总结和推广先进经验、派干部下乡具体指导等办法，推动平地整畦工作的进展。冠县、齐河、平原、阳谷等县，经过派出水利技术干部到乡、社帮助指导和组织参观以后，平地整畦工作已经获得成绩。现在这些地区已经平整的土地，已占水井应灌溉面积的一半以上。另外，不少地区的农业社在平整土地的同时，还修复了雨季被水冲毁的一些水井。菏泽、聊城两个专区夏秋两季被水冲毁的水井有一万四千九百多眼，现在不仅大部分已经修复，而且有不少水井还加高了井台。
