Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: To celebrate the opening of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition, Murata Shozo and Shukutani Eiichi held a reception

Murata Shozo, President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and President of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition, and Shukutani Eiichi, Head of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition Delegation, held a reception at the Beijing Hotel tonight to celebrate the opening of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition.

Premier Zhou Enlai attended the reception. He said in his speech that the exhibition of this Japanese commodity exhibition, I believe, will play a significant role in promoting trade, friendly relations, and friendship between the peoples of China and Japan. In the past eleven years, both China and Japan have undergone great changes. These major changes have provided both countries with new opportunities for development on the basis of two thousand years of history. The exhibition of this Japanese commodity exhibition in Beijing, with so many visitors, shows that the Chinese people, especially the people of Beijing, are willing to be friendly with the Japanese people and are willing to see the development of Japanese industry, agriculture, handicrafts, products and technology.

Premier Zhou Enlai then pointed out that more than two hundred Japanese friends gathered here tonight, which also shows that the Japanese people are willing to be friendly with the Chinese people. Therefore, although we are meeting for the first time, we are all very happy with each other. I hope that the people of China and Japan will follow this path of development to make the relations between the two countries more friendly.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that China and Japan are not yet completely independent, which means that they are still subject to foreign interference. Therefore, we should sympathize with each other and understand each other, which requires us to support each other and help each other. Premier Zhou Enlai also said that Japan is an industrially advanced and scientifically developed country. What you can help us with exceeds what we can help you with; of course, we will not be stingy with our strength. As long as we can do it, such as mineral ores, soybeans and other agricultural products, we will supply you with them, so that we can support each other and exchange what we have.

Premier Zhou Enlai continued, "I hope to promote the relations between China and Japan on the basis of peaceful coexistence, friendly cooperation, equality and mutual benefit, and truly achieve common existence and common prosperity." Finally, he raised his glass and said, "Let us use Japanese sake to toast to the health of all Japanese friends present and to the successful success of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition."

Murata Shozo spoke at the beginning of the reception, expressing his gratitude to the Chinese government and people for their concern, attention and assistance to the Japanese Commodity Exhibition. He said that it is difficult for us to express our gratitude for your country's kindness in words, and only by our practical actions to promote friendly relations between China and Japan can we repay you.

Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, also spoke at the reception. He warmly congratulated the success of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition.

After his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai went to various parts of the hall and toasted with Japanese friends. When Premier Zhou Enlai walked to the table of the delegation of Japanese Diet members promoting Sino-Japanese trade, Japanese friends and Premier Zhou Enlai shouted "Long live Sino-Japanese friendship." Members of the Japanese six major metropolitan, prefectural, county and city delegations shouted "Long live! Friendship!" to Premier Zhou Enlai in Chinese. Among the Japanese cultural figures delegation, Premier Zhou Enlai and Japanese friends cheered together for long live Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges! The head of the Japanese cultural figures delegation, Japanese musician Naohiro Tanabe, said, "For fifty years, I have been using music to connect the friendship between the peoples of Japan and China." Premier Zhou said, "I would love to hear your music."

A Japanese journalist attending the reception asked Premier Zhou Enlai what steps China would take to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations if the Japan-Soviet negotiations were successful. Premier Zhou Enlai replied that Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations would eventually be restored. But the difficulty lies on the Japanese side and not on our side. China hopes to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations as soon as possible, but in view of the current difficulties on the Japanese side, we are willing to wait. But both sides should take transitional steps to promote the road to the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

At the reception, Premier Zhou Enlai also toasted with the Japanese Commodity Exhibition Delegation, the Japanese Diet Members Promoting Sino-Japanese Trade League Delegation, the Japanese Mie Prefecture Delegation, as well as Japanese Diet members, peace activists and painters in Beijing.

Finally, Premier Zhou Enlai took photos with the various Japanese delegations and people from all walks of life in Japan.

Also invited to the reception tonight were Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade, Lei Renmin, Li Zhuchen, Ji Chaoding, Vice Chairmen of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, Chen Shutong, Director of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and other heads of people's organizations, people from all walks of life in Beijing, as well as famous people who had visited Japan, such as Liu Ningyi, Liao Chengzhi, and Li Dequan.

    庆祝日本商品展览会开幕
    村田省藏和宿谷荣一举行酒会
    新华社8日讯　日本国际贸易促进协会会长、日本商品展览会总裁村田省藏和日本商品展览团团长宿谷荣一今晚在北京饭店举行酒会，庆祝日本商品展览会开幕。
    周恩来总理出席了酒会。他在会上讲话说，这次日本商品展览会的展出，我相信对于促进中日两国的贸易、友好关系和两国人民友谊方面会起重大作用。十一年来，中日两国都起了很大变化，这种重大变化，使两国在两千年的历史基础上得到了新的发展机会。这次日本商品展览会在北京展出，得到这么多的观众参观，说明中国人民首先北京人民是愿意同日本人民友好的，是愿意看到日本工业、农业、手工业产品和技术的发展的。
    周恩来总理接着指出，今晚有二百多位日本朋友在这里聚会，这也说明日本人民是愿和中国人民友好的。所以，我们大家虽然初次见面，但是彼此都很高兴。我希望中日两国人民顺着这条发展道路，使两国关系更加友好。
    周恩来总理说，我们中日两国现在还没有完全独立，这就是说还受外国干涉。因此，我们应互相同情、互相了解，这就要我们互相支持，互相帮助。周恩来总理又说，日本是一个工业先进、科学发达的国家，你们能够帮助我们的，超过我们能够帮助你们的；当然，我们也不会吝惜我们的力量，只要我们能够作到的，如矿石、大豆和其他的农产品，我们就供应你们，这样互相支援，互通有无。
    周恩来总理接着又说，我希望在和平共处、友好合作、平等互利的基础上，促进中日两国的关系，真正作到共存共荣。最后，他举起酒杯说，让我们用日本酒，为在座的全体日本朋友的健康，为日本商品展览会的胜利成功而干杯。
    村田省藏在酒会开始时讲话，对中国政府和人民对日本商品展览会的关怀、重视和协助表示感谢。他说，对贵国的这种盛情，我们用语言难以表达谢意，只有用我们努力促进中日两国友好关系的实际行动来答谢。
    中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸也在酒会上讲了话。他热烈祝贺日本商品展览会展出的成功。
    周恩来总理在讲话后到大厅各处和日本朋友们干杯。周恩来总理走到日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟代表团人员桌子旁边的时候，日本朋友和周恩来总理都高呼中日友好万岁。日本六大都、府、县、市访华代表团人员用中国话向周恩来总理欢呼“万岁！友好！”在日本文化人士访华代表团中间，周恩来总理和日本朋友一块欢呼中日文化交流万岁！日本文化人士访华代表团团长、日本音乐家田边尚雄说，我五十年来一直用音乐把日中两国人民的友谊联系在一起。周总理说，我很愿意听到你的音乐。
    出席酒会的日本记者问周恩来总理，如果日苏谈判获得成功的话，中国对恢复日中邦交将采取什么步骤？周恩来总理回答说，中日两国邦交终久是要恢复的。但是困难是在日本方面而不在我们方面。中国是希望早日恢复中日邦交的，但是鉴于日本方面目前的困难，我们愿意等待。可是我们双方都应该采取过渡的步骤，向促进恢复中日两国邦交的道路上发展。
    周恩来总理在酒会上，还同日本商品展览团、日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟代表团、日本三重县代表团以及在京的日本国会议员、和平人士和画家等一起干杯。
    最后，周恩来总理分别同各日本代表团和日本各界人士照了相。
    今晚应邀出席酒会的，还有对外贸易部部长叶季壮，中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席雷任民、李烛尘、冀朝鼎，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若，中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通，中国人民外交学会会长张奚若和其他各人民团体负责人，北京各界人士，以及曾经访问过日本的著名人士刘宁一、廖承志、李德全等。
