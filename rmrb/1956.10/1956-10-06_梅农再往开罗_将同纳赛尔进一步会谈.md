    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 5th. Indian Minister without Portfolio Menon left New Delhi on the evening of October 4th for Cairo to hold further talks with President Nasser. The Indian cabinet decided to send him to Cairo after meeting on October 3rd to discuss the recent Suez situation.

    Speaking to reporters at Palam Airport, Menon cited four factors as indicating an improvement in the Suez crisis: "There is less talk about conflict now; the Suez Canal is open and unobstructed; the Security Council is about to meet; and the atmosphere of the talks is better."

    According to the "Times of India", Menon had discussed the Suez situation with Prime Minister Nehru on October 4th before his departure. He also met with British High Commissioner to India, MacDonald. The Chargé d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy in India, Bartlett, also visited him at the Indian Foreign Ministry.

    This is the third time Menon has been sent abroad on a mission since the nationalization of the Suez Canal. His most recent trip to Cairo was during the London Eighteen-Nation Conference. He had only returned to New Delhi from London and Paris four days ago.

    梅农再往开罗
    将同纳赛尔进一步会谈
    据新华社新德里5日电　印度不管部长梅农10月4日晚离开新德里到开罗去同纳赛尔总统举行进一步的会谈。印度内阁是在10月3日开会讨论了最近的苏伊士形势以后决定派他到开罗去的。
    梅农在巴兰机场同记者谈话的时候，举出四个因素说明苏伊士危机有了好转：“现在关于冲突的谈论不那么多了；苏伊士运河畅通无阻；安全理事会就要开会；人们谈话的气氛比较好了。”
    据“印度时报”报道，梅农在动身前曾经在10月4日同尼赫鲁总理讨论了苏伊士局势。他还同英国驻印度高级专员麦克唐纳会晤过。美国驻印度大使馆临时代办巴特勒特也到印度外交部访问过他。
    自从苏伊士运河收归国有以来，这是梅农第三次奉命出使国外。他最近一次到开罗是在伦敦十八国会议期间。他从伦敦和巴黎回到新德里只有四天。
