    The Phenomenon of Wasting Air Transport Capacity Should Be Corrected
    Currently, air transport is very strained. Many passengers cannot buy plane tickets, and a lot of cargo is piling up at airports. However, some people are using the convenience of their positions to arbitrarily waste valuable air transport capacity.
    On July 14th, the Beijing Administration of the Civil Aviation Administration of China dispatched a special flight, No. 101, from Beijing to Chongqing. The honored guests on this plane numbered only ten, most of whom were basketball team members from the Beijing Administration, led by the union chairman Wu Li to Chongqing to compete with the Chongqing Administration's team. Some were employees of the Beijing Administration taking advantage of the flight to travel to Chongqing for leisure. After these free passengers flew to Chongqing and played two basketball games, at the suggestion of Mao Kai, the director of the Chongqing Administration of the Civil Aviation Administration, they took the same special flight to Chengdu to play more games, adding eleven employees from the Chongqing Administration who went to Chengdu to watch the excitement. On July 18th, this special flight finally completed its transportation mission and returned to Beijing via Xi'an. This "business trip" lasted five days, with a total flight time of more than ten hours. The direct cost of each flight hour was over 600 yuan. Please calculate how much money was wasted for the country?
    For the Civil Aviation Administration, free plane tickets are not uncommon. Staff members on assignments or business trips, employees on leave returning home, and family members traveling to and from, often receive free plane tickets. In April of this year, the number of free passengers of the Civil Aviation Administration departing from Beijing alone reached as many as 182. Due to the increasing number of people flying for free, the Beijing Sales Office of the Civil Aviation Administration sometimes has to delay the transport of already accepted passengers and cargo, which not only makes passengers dissatisfied but also reduces state revenue. One of the main reasons why the Beijing Sales Office of the Civil Aviation Administration failed to meet its passenger revenue target in April was that many seats were occupied by free passengers.
    During the "Three-Anti" campaign, the phenomenon of the Civil Aviation Administration's abuse of special flights was exposed, which alerted the leaders of the Civil Aviation Administration at that time. Unexpectedly, after only a few years, this unreasonable situation has reappeared. The state's valuable air transport capacity cannot be squandered like this. It is hoped that relevant departments will stop this phenomenon of wasting state property.　A reader

### 应该纠正浪费空运力量的现象

    应该纠正浪费空运力量的现象
    目前，航空运输十分紧张，很多旅客买不到飞机票，不少货物积压在机场，但是，却有一些人利用自己职权的方便，任意浪费宝贵的航空运输力量。
    7月14日，中国民用航空局北京管理处特派一○一号飞机，自北京至重庆作专机飞行，搭载这架飞机的贵客只有十人，大部分是北京管理处的篮球队员，他们是由工会主席吴力率领去重庆和重庆管理处的球队进行比赛的，还有一些是乘便搭机去重庆游玩的北京管理处的职工。当这些免费乘客飞到了重庆，赛了两场篮球之后，又在民航局重庆管理处处长毛恺的倡议下，仍乘这架专机飞到成都赛球，机上又加上了十一个重庆管理处去成都看热闹的职工。7月18日，这架专机才算完成了运送任务由成都经西安返抵北京。这次“出差”历时五天，共飞行了十余小时，每飞行一小时的直接成本即达六百余元，请算一下为国家浪费了多少钱？
    对民航局来说，免票乘坐飞机并不是稀罕的事。工作人员调差、出差，职工请假回家和家属来往，常常是免费赠送飞机票。今年4月份，民航局的免费乘客只是从北京一站搭机出发的就达一百八十二人之多。由于免费搭机的人数日益增多，民航局北京营业处有时不得不延缓运送已经承运的客货，不仅使旅客不满，也减少了国家收入。民航局北京营业处4月份没有完成客运收入计划的主要原因之一，就是由于很多座位被免费乘客占用了。
    在“三反”运动时，曾经揭发民航局滥用专机飞行的现象，当时也引起民航局领导上的警惕，想不到隔了没有几年，竟然又出现这种不合理的情况了。国家宝贵的航空运输力不能这样被挥霍掉，希望有关部门制止这种浪费国家财产的现象。　一读者
