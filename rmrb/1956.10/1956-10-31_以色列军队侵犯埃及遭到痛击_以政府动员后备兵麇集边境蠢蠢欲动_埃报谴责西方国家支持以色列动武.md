Xinhua News Agency, October 30th dispatch from Tel Aviv: An Israeli army announcement on October 29th stated that Israeli forces had invaded Egyptian territory.

    The announcement said that Israeli troops "entered and attacked Egyptian commando bases in the Kontilla and Nakhl areas, and have occupied strongholds west of the Nakhl highway junction leading to the Suez Canal."

    Kontilla and Nakhl are both located within Egyptian territory.

Xinhua News Agency, October 30th dispatch from Cairo: According to an announcement today by the Egyptian military, the Israeli forces that invaded Egypt's Sinai Peninsula on the night of October 29th have suffered "heavy casualties."

    An Egyptian military spokesman said, "Egyptian vanguard units encountered enemy forces at Kontilla, Timich, and Nakhl at 5:00 AM Greenwich time. The enemy forces were unable to defeat the Egyptian army. The Egyptian army thwarted the Israeli plan."

    Egyptian President Nasser held a meeting with Egyptian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Amer and other senior military aides on the evening of October 29th to discuss how to deal with the Israeli offensive. The Egyptian Armed Forces Command has recalled all officers and soldiers on leave to counter the Israeli threat.

    Life remains normal in Cairo and the Suez Canal area, which is less than eighty kilometers from the fighting. Navigation through the Suez Canal continues as usual.

Xinhua News Agency, October 30th dispatch from TASS, Tel Aviv: The Israeli government held a meeting on October 28th, during which Prime Minister Ben-Gurion and Foreign Minister Meir reported on the implementation of foreign policy and the military situation.

    After the meeting, the government issued a statement announcing that it had decided to "mobilize several reserve battalions" and deploy them in the "border areas" between Israel and its neighbors. The government presented the provocative argument that "the enemy may attack Israel" as a pretext for this measure.

    Newspapers such as the "Jerusalem Post" emphasized that this was the largest Israeli mobilization in recent years. Unlike past mobilizations, it was "preparation for war."

Xinhua News Agency, October 30th dispatch: According to Western news agency reports, Cairo newspapers today prominently published news of the Israeli army's invasion of Egyptian territory, with many newspapers condemning Western countries for supporting Israel's "display of force."

    "Al-Akhbar" headlined: "Israeli Army Attacks Egyptian Territory - Israel Admits It Launched Aggression."

    "Al-Gomhuria" carried a banner headline: "Israel Launches War, Occupies Areas Where No Troops are Stationed."

    "Al-Gomhuria" editor Sadat published an article warning those who launch wars not to play with fire. He said: "Israel will know that the fire it ignites will burn no one but Israel and those behind Israel."

    Reports indicate that the main target of the Israeli army's offensive is the city of Suez at the southern end of the Suez Canal. A United Press International dispatch from Jerusalem on October 29th pointed out that if the navigation of the Suez Canal is disrupted by the war, Britain may use the pretext of "protecting the canal" to invoke the 1954 Anglo-Egyptian agreement and redeploy troops in the canal area. At the same time, the United States, Britain, and France could also invoke the 1950 Tripartite Declaration on the Middle East under the pretext of "stopping the war" and deploy troops in the Middle East.

    埃报谴责西方国家支持以色列动武
    新华社30日讯　特拉维夫消息：以色列陆军方面10月29日发表公报说，以色列军队已经攻入埃及国境。
    这项公报说，以色列部队“进入和进攻了在孔蒂拉和纳奎角地区内的埃及突击兵基地，并且已经占领了通向苏伊士运河的纳赫尔公路会合点以西的据点。”
    所提到的孔蒂拉和纳奎角都在埃及国境以内。
    新华社30日讯　开罗消息：据埃及军方今天宣布，10月29日夜晚侵入埃及领土西奈半岛的以色列军队已经遭到“重大伤亡”。
    埃及军方发言人说，“埃及先遣部队在格林威治时间早晨五时在孔蒂拉、蒂米持和纳赫尔同敌军遭遇。敌军无法战胜埃及军队。埃及军队击败了以色列的计划。”
    埃及总统纳赛尔在10月29日晚间同埃及武装部队总司令阿密尔等高级军事助手举行了会议，讨论对付以色列进攻的问题。埃及武装部队司令部已经召回所有在休假的军官和军人，以便对付以色列的威胁。
    在开罗和离战斗地点不到八十公里的苏伊士运河区生活仍正常。苏伊士运河航运照常进行。
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社特拉维夫讯：以色列政府10月28日举行会议，总理本—古里安和外交部长梅厄夫人在会上报告了外交政策执行情况和军事局势。
    会后，政府发表了一项声明，宣布政府已经决定
  “动员若干后备营”，把它们部署在以色列同邻国的
  “交界地区”。政府提出“敌人可能攻击以色列”的挑衅论调作为这项措施的借口。
      “耶路撒冷邮报”等报纸强调指出，这是近年来以色列最大的一次动员。它不同于过去的动员，是
  “为战争作准备的”。
    新华社30日讯　据西方通讯社消息：开罗各报今天以显著地位刊载了以色列军队侵入埃及领土的消息，许多报纸谴责西方国家支持以色列“显示武力”。
      “消息报”标题说：“以色列军队进攻埃及领土——以色列承认它发动了侵略”。
      “共和国报”的通栏标题是：“以色列发动了战争，占领了没有驻扎军队的地区”。
      “共和国报”主编萨达特发表文章警告发动战争的人不要玩火自焚。他说：“以色列将会知道，它燃起来的火除了烧到以色列和在以色列背后的人以外，不会烧着别人”。
    消息报道，以色列军队的主攻目标是苏伊士运河南端的苏伊士市。合众社10月29日从耶路撒冷发出的一条消息指出：如果苏伊士运河的通航由于战争而受阻，英国可能以“保护运河”为借口援引英国和埃及的1954年的协定把军队重新开入运河地区。同时，美、英、法也可以借口“制止战争”而援引1950年关于中东问题的三国宣言把军队开入中东。
