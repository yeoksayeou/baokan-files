Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th - Xinmin County, Liaoning Province, historically known as "the tail end of nine rivers, plagued by floods nine years out of ten," has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in this first year after agricultural cooperation. The county's 181,000 hectares of grain crops are expected to yield 257,000 tons, exceeding last year's highest output by 30.5%.

Xinmin County was originally a low-lying area with many rivers, constantly threatened by floods. This year, after the entire county achieved agricultural cooperation, it provided ample conditions for building dikes and digging canals to combat floods. Last winter and this spring, agricultural cooperatives throughout the county built a total of 283 flood control and drainage projects, repairing dikes, opening canals, and digging drainage ditches with a total length of over 570,000 *chi* (approximately 190,000 meters), and constructing 43 terraced fields with irrigation and drainage systems, ensuring that 25,000 hectares of land were protected from flooding. Relying on these projects, farmers also newly cultivated 2,963 hectares of paddy fields on previously waterlogged land. For example, Luotun Township built a reservoir this year and converted 380 hectares of waterlogged ponds into paddy fields. The rice is growing very well, yielding 5,000 *jin* (2.5 tons) per hectare, more than double the yield of local dryland crops.

Before liberation, Xinmin County suffered from frequent disasters, and the lives of farmers were impoverished, with many flat and fertile fields left uncultivated. This year, agricultural cooperatives in various places actively reclaimed these barren lands. The county increased its cultivated area by a total of 11,190 hectares by reclaiming wasteland, reducing the size of field paths, eliminating unnecessary boundaries between fields and unnecessary village roads.

Agricultural cooperatives throughout the county also adopted various measures to increase production, such as planting high-yield crops and increasing the area under multiple cropping, all of which played a significant role in increasing grain production.

    合作化后的第一年
    十年九涝的新民县空前丰收
    新华社沈阳12日电　一向被称为“九河下梢，十年九涝”的辽宁省新民县，在今年合作化后的第一年，获得了空前未有的大丰收。全县十八万一千多垧粮食作物，预计可以产二十五万七千吨，超过产量最高的去年30.5％。
    新民县原是一个低洼多河历年都受水灾威胁的地区。今年全县实现农业合作化后，为修堤挖渠战胜水害提供了充分的条件。去冬今春全县农业社共兴修防洪排涝工程二百八十三项，修堤、开渠和挖排水沟共长五十七万多尺，修沟洫畦田四十三处，保证了二万五千垧土地免受水灾。依靠这些工程，农民又在涝洼地上新开了水田二千九百六十三垧。如罗屯乡今年修了一座水库，把三百八十垧涝洼塘改成了稻田，稻子长得很好，每垧可产五千斤，比当地旱田作物增产一倍以上。
    解放前的新民县，由于灾害重重，农民生活贫困，许多平坦的良田撩荒了。今年，各地农业社积极地把这些荒地开垦起来，全县从开荒和减少毛道、地格以及不必要的乡道等方面，共增加了耕地面积一万一千一百九十垧。
    全县农业社还采取了多种高产作物、增加复种面积等增产措施，对粮食增产也都起了很大的作用。
