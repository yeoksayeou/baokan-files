The British "Daily Telegraph" Editorial Says That Kuomintang Secret Agents Created a Very Dangerous Riot; Hong Kong Authorities Should Prevent Similar Incidents From Happening Again

This newspaper reports that the British "Daily Telegraph" published an editorial on October 13th titled "The Danger in Hong Kong," which stated: Beijing has shown surprising restraint towards Hong Kong. They have not demanded to incorporate it into the Communist mainland. However, because the Kuomintang is attacking the pro-Communist elements in this colony, Beijing has been given a pretext that they might find desirable. To make interference justifiable, protecting the lives and property of Chinese Communists is a very resounding slogan. Therefore, it is crucial for the Hong Kong government to restore order and prevent riots from happening again.

These Kuomintang riots are very dangerous, and cannot be dismissed as an understandable expression of political and social disappointment. At present, Beijing seems too busy with domestic affairs to care about Hong Kong. But one day, they are likely to raise this week's turmoil as an example of the sins and failures of British rule. Therefore, no effort should be spared to prevent troublemakers from staging such an incident again.

    英国“每日电讯报”社论说
    国民党特务制造的暴乱十分危险
    香港当局应防止再发生类似事件
    本报讯　10月13日的英国“每日电讯报”题为“香港的危险”的社论说：对于香港，北京表现了出人意外的抑制。他们没有要求把它并入共产党大陆。但是，由于国民党对这个殖民地的亲共分子进行攻击，北京就有了他们可能是求之不得的那种借口。要使干涉师出有名，保护中共国民生命财产就是一个非常响亮的口号。因此，香港政府恢复秩序和防止再发生暴乱是至关紧要的。
    这种国民党的暴乱十分危险，不能认为这是一种政治和社会失望情绪的可以理解的表现而不把它当回事。目前北京似乎太忙于国内的事情而没有时间顾及香港。但是总有一天，很可能把这个星期的骚乱提出来作为一个例子，说明英国统治的罪恶和失败。因此应该不遗余力，防止捣乱分子再搞这么一次。
