    (XVI) China, Aswan Salutes You
    Taking a car from Luxor and continuing south for about four or five hours, we arrived at Aswan, a city in southern Egypt. From northern to southern Egypt, the climate has changed significantly. In Aswan, the weather in early April was already unbearably hot.
    When we arrived at the Aswan train station, crowds welcoming the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation waved flags and shouted "Long Live Egyptian-Chinese Friendship!" and "Long Live Peace!" The people here seemed somewhat different from those in northern Egypt; their skin was darker and they were thinner. Suddenly, a troop of Boy Scouts marched in formation from a side road. The children saluted us neatly and shouted in unison, "China, Aswan salutes you!"
    The next day, we went boating on the Nile. Green flowing water, blue sky, and looking at the two banks, dense green foliage covered the barren hills. The boat took us to a small island, a small museum where you could see some pottery from prehistoric times. The boat also took us to a botanical garden. There were more than three hundred kinds of tropical trees, and the garden was full of beautiful roses, impatiens, and many kinds of exotic and fragrant flowers. Elementary school students from Aswan came to the garden to perform gymnastics for us, and children from nearby rural areas came to dance folk dances for us. In the garden, we also met a ragged folk artist. He held a banhu in his hand and repeatedly played some simple tunes. He seemed to be a street performer. Among us was a young artist who played the banhu on stage. It is said that the banhu was introduced to China from Arab countries. But now the Chinese banhu has evolved to be more complex; and what we saw in the hands of this busker in Aswan may be the original form of the banhu.
    In the center of the river, we also saw a temple in the water. This is a very old temple, but it has been submerged for a long time. During the annual receding water season, its top is exposed above the water.
    The boat continued to speed along the Nile. The arrival of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation attracted some engineers working at the Aswan Low Dam. They came to the boat to celebrate with us. Among them was an engineer named Gondi, who was nearly seventy years old. But his spirit was still full and full of optimism. He still loved singing and dancing like a child. He sang an Egyptian folk song on the boat: "Shake hands, shake hands, when we meet." As he sang, he danced. Gondi told me that when he was young, he liked to sing his own Egyptian songs and dance his own Egyptian dances. Young Gondi often gathered a few friends on the Nile, rowing small boats and singing towards the vast Nile. Gondi pointed to the calm flowing water and the green trees on both sides and said, "Look, how beautiful our mountains and rivers are! ... I like our songs, I like our dances, and I also like our Nile." I suddenly remembered that when this Egyptian old man was young, wasn't it the era when Britain ruled Egypt? So I deeply understood the feelings of this Egyptian.
    In Aswan, although there was no theater, the Chinese artists still performed. They not only performed Chinese songs and dances, but also Egyptian songs and dances. Many Egyptians talked about it this way after watching the performance of the Chinese artists: "Do our Chinese friends understand Arabic? No. Then why do they sing our songs so beautifully? It's really amazing."
    The songs of the Chinese people spread to the north of Egypt, and then to the south of Egypt, and deeply planted the seeds of friendship in the hearts of the Egyptian people. At a tea party hosted by all circles in Aswan for the Chinese artists, Maruz, the head of the cultural district of Aswan, said:
      "Please tell the Chinese people that on the banks of the Nile there is a friendly country that has infinite respect and friendship for you; tell the Chinese people that the Egyptian people will always be friendly with you."

    埃及纪游

    （十六）　中国，阿斯旺向你致敬
    从拉克索搭车继续南行，大概经过了四、五个小时，就到达了埃及南方的城市阿斯旺。从埃及的北方到南方，气候有了很大的变化。在阿斯旺，4月初的天气已经使人感到热得不能忍受了。
    当我们到达阿斯旺车站时，欢迎中国文化艺术代表团的人群在车站上挥动着旗帜，高呼“埃中友好万岁！”“和平万岁！”这里的人显得同埃及北方的人有些异样，他们的肌肤更黑，更消瘦。忽然，从一条横路上有一队童子军整着步伐走来。孩子们整齐地向我们敬礼，并齐声地高喊：“中国，阿斯旺向你致敬！”
    第二天，我们在尼罗河上泛舟。青青的流水，蓝蓝的天空，向两岸望去，茂密的绿色的枝叶遮掩着荒秃的山丘。游船把我们带到了河上的一个小岛，这是一个小型的博物馆，那里可以看到史前时期的一些陶器。游船又把我们带到一个植物公园。那里有着三百种以上的热带树，满园盛开着美丽的玫瑰、凤仙和许多种奇异芬芳的鲜花。阿斯旺的小学生到园里来为我们表演体操，附近农村的孩子们来为我们跳了民间舞蹈。在花园里，我们还遇到了一个衣衫褴褛的民间艺人。他手上拿着一只板胡，反复地奏着一些简单的曲调。他似乎是个沿街卖唱的艺人。在我们中间有一位青年艺术家，他是在舞台上演奏板胡的。据说，板胡是从阿拉伯国家传到中国去的。但是现在中国的板胡已经演变得较为复杂了；而我们在阿斯旺这个卖唱者手中看到的，可能就是板胡的那种原始形式。
    在河的中央，我们还看到一座在水里的庙。这是一座非常古老的庙宇，但是从很久的年代以来，它被水淹没了，在每年退水季节，它的顶部便露出了水面。
    游船继续疾驶在尼罗河上。中国文化艺术代表团的到来，吸引了一些在阿斯旺低水坝工作的工程人员们。他们到船上来同我们联欢。他们中间有一位名叫贡地的工程人员，已是一个近七十岁的老年人了。可是他的精神还很饱满的，并且充满着乐观的精神。他仍然像孩子那样地爱好唱歌和跳舞。他在船上唱起一支埃及的民歌：“握手呵，握手呵，当我们见面的时候。”他一面唱着，一面手舞足蹈起来。贡地告诉我，年轻的时候，他就喜欢唱埃及自己的歌和跳埃及自己的舞。年青的贡地时常约好几个朋友到尼罗河上，划着小舟向着辽阔的尼罗河歌唱。贡地指着那平静的流水和两岸青翠的树林说：“你看，我们的山河多美呵！……我喜欢我们的歌，喜欢我们的舞，我也喜欢我们的尼罗河。”我忽然想起，当这位埃及老人年轻的时候，不正是英国统治埃及的时代吗？于是我深深地理解了这位埃及人的感情。
    在阿斯旺，虽然没有剧院，中国艺术家们还是演出了。他们不仅演出了中国的歌舞节目，而且也演出了埃及的歌舞。许多埃及人在看完中国艺术家的演出后都这样谈论着：“我们的中国朋友懂阿拉伯文吗？不懂。那为什么他们把我们的歌唱得这样美好呢？实在太惊人了。”
    中国人民的歌声传到了埃及的北方，又传到了埃及的南方，在埃及人民的心中深深地栽下了友谊的种子。在阿斯旺各界招待中国艺术家的一次茶会上，阿斯旺的文化区长马鲁兹说道：
      “请告诉中国人民说，在尼罗河的两岸有一个友好的国家对你们怀着无限的崇敬和友情；告诉中国人民说，埃及人民将永远同你们友好。”
