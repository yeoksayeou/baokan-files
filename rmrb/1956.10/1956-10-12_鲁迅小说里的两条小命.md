    Two Little Lives in Lu Xun's Novels
    Xu Gan
    Mr. Lu Xun, in the last line of his first novel, "Diary of a Madman," shouted the famous appeal, "Save the children." The meaning of this appeal, I think, is twofold: first, to strive to prevent the next generation, who have not yet been devoured by the feudal ethical code, from being eaten; second, to strive to prevent the next generation, who have not yet used the feudal ethical code to devour others, from ever eating people again. In short, it is aimed at the thousands-year-old man-eating feudal ethical code.
    However, in the thirty-plus years since the novel was published, this appeal has been widely quoted. For example, regarding parents who have lost their humanity, education that misleads children, and children's literature that harms people, public opinion has indignantly said: Listen to Mr. Lu Xun's appeal, save the children! This means that the tiger's mouth that eats children is not limited to the feudal ethical code alone.
    Indeed, concerning the tender lives of the young, there are many enemies that harm them. One of the greatest enemies, besides the feudal ethical code revealed in "Diary of a Madman," is the suffering caused by poverty, ignorance, and especially the backward state of medicine. Mr. Lu Xun also poignantly revealed these in two other novels, namely "Medicine," written in April 1919, and "Tomorrow," written in June 1920. The novels describe two young lives that died prematurely, and although the author did not use words like "save the children," the implied meaning and effect are the same.
    As most people already know, "Medicine" is Mr. Lu Xun's mourning for the death of the Shaoxing martyr Qiu Jin, although Qiu Jin is renamed Xia Yu in the novel. The mention of using a blood-soaked bun as medicine symbolically lashes out at the fact that some people in the world drink the blood of revolutionaries. However, the second theme of this novel is also very clear, that is, it simultaneously condemns people's blind faith in "folk remedies."
    Old Man Hua and his wife, who run a tea shop, have an only son named Little Shuan. But Little Shuan has fallen ill. The symptoms are: an extraordinarily large appetite, but with profuse sweating after eating, and constant coughing, the person thin, "the two shoulder blades sticking out high." It is obviously consumption, which people in Shaoxing call "loss disease." According to the old Chinese medicine of thirty or forty years ago, "loss" is a deficiency, and "a deficient body cannot tolerate tonics," so medicine is generally powerless. If you ask a doctor, he can only give you a "prescription," telling the patient to take thirty or fifty doses; whether it cures or not, they often say, "It depends on your family's luck."
    Old Man Hua and his wife are anxious to save their son, how can they not be worried, how can they not believe in the almost ancient, well-founded folk remedies, wanting to use a bun dipped in the blood gushing from the neck of an executed criminal as a special medicine? Moreover, they happened to meet Kang, the executioner from the government office, who specializes in this kind of business.
    The poor old man, in the middle of the night, took a packet of hard-earned foreign money, trembling, and bought such a bloody bun from the execution ground in Shaoxing's ancient Xuántíngkǒu, where revolutionaries were executed. He baked it over a fire and watched Little Shuan eat it bite by bite, filled with the hope of bringing him back to life. Their ignorance is detestable, but we cannot say they are guilty. Because the guilt lies with the quack doctors who fabricated such nonsense, the "good people" who spread such nonsense, and the likes of the executioner Kang who use it to swindle money.

    鲁迅小说里的两条小命
    徐淦
    鲁迅先生在他那头一篇小说“狂人日记”的末一行，喊出了著名的呼声“救救孩子”。这呼声的含义，我想，一是要大家努力使还没有被礼教吃掉的下一代免于被吃，二是要大家努力使还没有借礼教吃过人的下一代再不要吃人，总之，是针对几千年来的吃人的礼教的。
    但是，小说发表以后的三十多年来，这呼声得到了广泛的引用，譬如，对于失去人性的父母，误人子弟的教育，害人不浅的儿童文学，舆论都愤慨地说：请听听鲁迅先生的呼声，救救孩子！这就是说，吃孩子的虎口，不仅礼教而已。
    的确，就幼小者的嫩弱的生命来说，戕害它的仇敌很多，其中的大敌之一，除了“狂人日记”所揭示的礼教，鲁迅先生在另外两篇小说里，也沉痛地揭示了人们在贫穷、愚昧，尤其是医学落后状态下害病的情景。这两篇小说，就是1919年4月写的“药”，和1920年6月写的“明天”。小说写到两个夭折的小生命，作者并没有再用救救孩子那样的字句，但包含的意思和效果是同样的。
    “药”，诚如大家已经多半知道，鲁迅先生悼念着绍兴籍的烈士秋瑾之死，虽然那里面的秋瑾已经改称夏瑜了，所说的血馒头当药吃，也的确象征地鞭挞着世间有人喝革命者的鲜血的事实；但是，这篇小说的第二主题也很明显，即同时谴责了人们的“单方”迷。
    开茶店的华老栓夫妇，只有独生儿子小栓。小栓却得了病。病状是：饭量异乎寻常的大，一吃却又满头大汗，不断的咳嗽，人瘦得“两块肩胛骨高高凸出”。可见是肺痨，绍兴人叫它“损病”。照三四十年前的中医的说法，损是虚损，而“虚不受补”，所以药石大抵是无能为力的。你去请教他，他也只能给你开一张“长方”，给病人三十剂、五十剂的吃下去；治与不治，往往说：“这要看你们的家运了。”
    华老栓夫妇救子心切，怎么能不着急，怎么能不听信几乎是古老相传、言在凿凿的单方，想用砍头的犯人脖子里冒出来的血蘸过的馒头来当特效药呢？何况，他们又正遇着了专做这宗生意的府衙门里的刽子手康某。
    可怜的老人，半夜里拿一包辛苦积蓄的洋钱，战战兢兢地在绍兴古轩亭口屠杀革命者的刑场上买来这么一个血淋淋的馒头，用火焙过，看小栓一口一口地吃下肚去，满怀着起死回生的希望。他们愚昧到了可恶的程度，然而总不能说他们有罪。因为，罪在编造出这种谰言的方技之士，罪在信口把诸如此类的谰言传播开去的“好人”，罪在以此骗钱的刽子手康某之流。
