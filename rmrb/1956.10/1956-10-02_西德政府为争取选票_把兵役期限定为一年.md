Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 29th -- The West German government made a decision on September 27th to limit the West German military service period to twelve months, instead of the eighteen months the government insisted on when the conscription bill was passed by the West German Federal Parliament in July of this year. As everyone knows, it was precisely because of the government's insistence on the length of military service and the differences with the Federal Council that it was unable to make a decision on this issue.

It is reported that the West German government's decision was made in consideration of next year's general election.

    西德政府为争取选票
    把兵役期限定为一年　　
    新华社29日讯　波恩消息：西德政府9月27日作出了一项决定，把西德的兵役期限定为十二个月而不是政府在西德联邦议院今年7月通过征兵法案的时候所坚持的十八个月。大家知道，正是由于政府在兵役期限问题上所坚持的意见和联邦参议院有分歧，因此一直没有能够就这个问题作出决定。　　
    据悉，西德政府的这项决定是考虑到明年的大选而作出的一种行动。
