	Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory Compound Glycyrrhiza Mixture Tablets Turn Black
	At the beginning of April this year, we purchased a batch of medicines from the Beijing Pharmaceutical Company, including a "Compound Glycyrrhiza Mixture Tablet" produced by the local state-owned Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory. The quality of this medicine is very poor. When we dispensed it to patients, it became sticky and turned black after about an hour. The sick comrades dared not take it.
	In mid-August, we purchased another batch of medicines from the Beijing Pharmaceutical Company, and the "Compound Glycyrrhiza Mixture Tablet" still became sticky and turned black. Comrades returned the medicine one after another and gave us many opinions. Not only was the medicine wasted, but it also directly affected the treatment work.
	When we were touring, we purchased "Compound Glycyrrhiza Mixture Tablets" produced by other pharmaceutical factories in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places, and they did not have this problem.
	In the name of a medical worker, I suggest that the Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory recall these products, and I hope that the health department will strengthen the inspection of various medicines.

    北京市制药厂复方甘草合剂片变黑
    今年4月初，我们曾在北京市医药公司购买了一批药品，其中有一种地方国营北京市制药厂出品的“复方甘草合剂片”。这种药品质量非常低劣，当我们把这种药品发给患者后，经过一个小时左右就发粘变黑。患病的同志都不敢吃。
    8月中旬，我们又到北京市医药公司购买了一批药品，其中的“复方甘草合剂片”还是爱发粘变黑。同志们都纷纷退药，还给我们提了很多意见。不但浪费了药品，而且直接影响到治疗工作。
    我们在巡回演出的时候，曾在上海、南京等地购买了一些其他制药厂生产的“复方甘草合剂片”，就没有这种毛病。
    我以一个医务工作者的名义，建议北京市制药厂将这些产品收回，并且希望卫生部门加强对各种药品的检查。
