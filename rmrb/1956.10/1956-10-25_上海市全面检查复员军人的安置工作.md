Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 24th: Shanghai is conducting a comprehensive inspection of the placement work for demobilized soldiers. Starting in October, inspection teams jointly formed by the Civil Affairs, Military Service, and other relevant departments under the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee have inspected the placement of over ten thousand demobilized soldiers throughout the city. The inspection teams held symposiums with over a thousand demobilized soldiers and conducted individual interviews in units such as the Bureau of Culture, the Bureau of Health, and some factories. The inspection teams introduced the experience of the CPC East Suburbs District Committee in attaching importance to leading the inspection of the placement of demobilized soldiers to relevant cadres throughout the city, and also offered criticisms and suggestions to some institutions that had improperly placed demobilized soldiers.

People's Committees in various districts and over sixty units, including the Shanghai Municipal Labor, Grain, and Light Industry Bureaus, have also formed work groups to conduct comprehensive inspections of the placement of demobilized soldiers in their respective units.

The Shanghai Municipal and District Procuratorates have also assigned procuratorial personnel to participate in the inspection work.
