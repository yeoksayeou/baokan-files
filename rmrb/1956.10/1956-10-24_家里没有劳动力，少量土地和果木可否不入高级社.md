    Question: I am a clerk at the Tiancheng Tang State-Private Joint Venture Chinese Medicine Store in Hangbu Town, Qu County, Zhejiang. There are five people in my family, and we rely entirely on my salary for a living. In my hometown, I have a little over one mu of land, and in the past, the income from the land could be used as a living subsidy. This one mu of land contains eight graves and eight tangerine trees. This year, after the advanced cooperative movement, most farmers in my village have put their land into the cooperative, and farmers' income relies entirely on labor. My family has no agricultural labor. If I put all of my one mu of land into the cooperative, the living subsidy will be gone. Is it possible for my family's one mu of land not to join the cooperative for the time being? If it must join the cooperative, is it possible to keep about two fen of land with five tangerine trees?　Zhuge Caisheng

    Answer: According to Article 15 of the "Model Charter for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives," villages that have achieved advanced agricultural cooperation are encouraged to have people working in the city but with no labor at home hand over their land to the cooperative, because doing so is conducive to the collective management of the agricultural production cooperative. After the land is used by the cooperative, if the owner has difficulties in life, the agricultural cooperative should take care of them and pay a certain remuneration. As for the graves and scattered fruit trees on the land, according to the model charter, they do not have to join the cooperative.

    家里没有劳动力，少量土地和果木可否不入高级社
    问：我是浙江衢县航埠镇公私合营天成堂国药店的店员，家里有五口人，完全靠我的工资收入维持生活。在家乡有一亩多地，过去土地的收入可作为生活补助。这一亩多地里有坟墓八穴，桔木八株。今年高级合作化以后，我乡大部分农户都把土地入社了，农户收入完全依靠劳动所得。我家没有农业劳动力，如果把一亩多地都入社，生活补助就没有了。我家的一亩多地暂不入社是否可以？如要入社，留下有五株桔木的二分多地是否可以？　诸葛财生
    答：根据“高级农业生产合作社示范章程”第十五条的规定，已经实现高级农业合作化的乡村，是鼓励在城市工作而家无劳力的人把土地交给社里使用的，因为这样做有利于农业生产合作社的集体经营。土地归社使用以后，如本主生活有困难，农业社应该给以照顾，付给一定报酬。至于坟地和土地上的零星果木，按照示范章程规定，可以不入社。
