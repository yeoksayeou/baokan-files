	The Qinghai Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and other units organized an inspection team to inspect the Qinghai Provincial Machinery Repair Factory. The inspection team found that the factory had a lot of waste products. More than 2,600 plowshares were scrapped, 5,300 plow bottoms, 7,200 plow brackets, and many other parts such as plow shovels, plow beams, and various screws were also scrapped. The total scrap rate had reached 45.5%. Therefore, the inspection team severely criticized this as a backward state of industry in the inspection report. Afterwards, the factory also processed these waste products and waste materials. Soon, a passage appeared in the brief report of the advanced producer movement of factories and mines of the Provincial Department of Industry: "The Machinery Repair Factory has transformed and utilized waste products and waste materials, which not only overfulfilled the production plan of mountain plows by 7.9%, but also saved funds for the country."

	If the previous report of the inspection team was criticism, then now there is praise. It is right to criticize mistakes and praise achievements immediately. Is there anything wrong with clear rewards and punishments?

	Not necessarily right. Utilizing waste products and waste materials is better than not utilizing them. However, the Qinghai Provincial Machinery Repair Factory only saved some losses after some efforts, and it cannot be said that after producing a large number of waste products, reusing the waste products is "saving funds." If this is called "saving funds," then wouldn't producing waste products become a shortcut to "saving"? Wouldn't more waste products mean greater savings achievements? Conversely, wouldn't those factories that do not produce waste products have the worst "savings" performance? According to this logical reasoning, where will we encourage enterprises to go?

    鼓励企业往哪里走？
    李熙波
    青海省工会联合会等单位组织检查组，到青海省机械修配厂检查。检查组发现：该厂的废品很多，报废的犁镜有二千六百多个，犁铧五千三百多个，犁托七千二百多个，其他如犁铡板、犁辕和各种螺丝报废的也很多，总的废品率已经达到45.5％。于是，检查组在检查报告里严厉批判说这是工业上的落后状态。事后工厂也把这批废品和废料加以处理。不久，在省工业厅的厂矿先进生产者运动的简报上，便出现了这么一段：“机械修配厂改造利用废品、废料，不但超额7.9％完成了山地步犁的生产计划，而且为国家节约了资金。”
    如果说以前检查组的报告是批评的话，那么现在又来了个表扬。做错了提出批评，做好了立刻表扬，赏罚分明还有什么不对的呢？
    未必对。利用废品废料，比不利用废品废料的是好的。但是青海省机械修配厂，只不过是经过一番努力，挽救了一部分损失，而不能说出了大批废品以后，再利用废品是“节约资金”。如果说这是“节约资金”，那么，出废品废料岂不成为“节约”的窍门了？岂不是废品越多，节约成绩越大？反过来，那些不出废品废料的工厂，岂不是“节约”最差劲的了？按照这个逻辑类推，我们将鼓励企业往哪里走？
