Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The joint statement of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the Singapore Chamber of Commerce and Trade Delegation, and the Federation of Malaya Chamber of Commerce and Trade Delegation, was signed in Beijing this afternoon.

Representing the Chinese side, Li Zhucheng, Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, signed the joint statement. Representing Singapore and Malaya were Ko Teck Kin, head of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce and Trade Delegation, and Lee Yan Lian, head of the Federation of Malaya Chamber of Commerce and Trade Delegation.

Vice Chairman Li Zhucheng delivered a speech at the signing ceremony, expressing his gratitude for the spirit of friendly cooperation shown by the two delegations during the negotiations. He said that due to the removal of artificial obstacles, Singapore and Malaya's main export commodity – rubber – has once again recovered its market in China. This time, China's import and export corporations have purchased considerable quantities of rubber and coconut products from Singapore and Malaya respectively, and the two delegations have also purchased many goods they need from Chinese companies. Facts have proved that eliminating artificial obstacles and developing economic exchanges on the basis of equality and mutual benefit is beneficial to both sides.

Li Zhucheng said that strengthening mutual exchanges is indeed a good way to promote trade and enhance understanding. We hope that more people from the business communities of Singapore and Malaya will be able to visit China in the future, and the Chinese business community also hopes to have the opportunity to visit Singapore and Malaya.

Head of Delegation Ko Teck Kin said in his speech that through this visit to China, a good foundation has been laid for direct trade between China and Singapore, which fully demonstrates that expanding normal trade is beneficial and helpful to the economic prosperity of both sides.

Head of Delegation Lee Yan Lian also spoke. He said that all members of our delegation are extremely excited and grateful for the success of this trade negotiation, and we also feel a great responsibility for how to strengthen the development of trade between the two sides in the future. We will intensify our efforts after we return. He said that through the development of trade between the two sides, the understanding and friendship between the people of China and Malaya will also be enhanced.

David Marshall also spoke at the signing ceremony, saying that mutually beneficial trade is the foundation of friendship. He hoped that on the basis of carrying out trade, our friendship will have greater development.

Attending today's signing ceremony from the Chinese side were Minister of Foreign Trade Ye Jizhuang, Vice Minister Li Zheren, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Chen Shutong, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade Nan Hanchen, and heads of various Chinese import and export corporations; from the Singapore and Malayan sides were David Marshall, advisor to the Singapore Chamber of Commerce and Trade Delegation and former Chief Minister of Singapore, and all members of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce and Trade Delegation and the Federation of Malaya Chamber of Commerce and Trade Delegation.
