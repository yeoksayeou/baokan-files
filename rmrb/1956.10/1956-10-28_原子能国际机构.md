International Atomic Energy Agency
	The International Conference on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, attended by eighty-two countries, which convened on September 20 at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, unanimously adopted the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency on October 23 and established a Preparatory Committee.

	According to the published draft statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the main purpose of this international agency is to "accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world." The statute stipulates that relevant countries should jointly donate a portion of normal uranium and atomic materials to this international agency, and extensively exchange the relevant scientific and technological experiences of various countries to promote international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy, especially to help underdeveloped countries to improve their economies.

	The proposal to organize the above-mentioned international atomic energy agency was first put forward by US President Eisenhower at the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly in 1953. One of the main purposes of the United States in proposing the establishment of an international atomic energy agency was to cover up the truth about its arms expansion and war preparations, and to resist the pressure from the people of the world to demand disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

	The Soviet government put forward its own proposal, advocating that countries participating in the agreement should undertake the sacred and unconditional obligation not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. The Soviet Union requested that its proposal be discussed simultaneously with the US proposal.

	From January to September 1954, the Soviet Union and the United States held negotiations on atomic energy issues. Because the US government insisted on avoiding discussion of the Soviet government's proposal to ban atomic weapons, the negotiations failed to reach an agreement.

	At the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly held in September 1954, the United States, together with Britain, France, Canada and other seven countries, put forward a joint proposal requesting the establishment of an international agency for the peaceful use of atomic energy. The Soviet government put forward four amendments to the seven-nation proposal: First, it requested the General Assembly to use all possible means to promote the use of major discoveries in atomic energy only for peaceful purposes; second, to continue negotiations to establish an international agency for the peaceful use of atomic energy; third, to require the international agency to be responsible to the United Nations and the Security Council; fourth, to invite all countries willing to participate to join the International Atomic Energy Agency. These proposals of the Soviet government were supported by many countries, and Western countries had to adopt the first and second amendments of the Soviet Union in their seven-nation joint proposal, and considered the third amendment. Due to the obstruction of the United States, the fourth amendment proposed by the Soviet Union was not passed. The US government made it clear that this was to exclude the participation of the People's Republic of China. Finally, the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted the amended seven-nation proposal on November 24.

	By the Tenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, in order to seize the initiative, the United States, together with Britain, France, Canada, Belgium, Portugal, the Federation of South Africa, and Australia, put forward a statute of an international atomic energy agency and distributed it to the General Assembly for discussion. This statute, drafted unilaterally by them, did not conform to the principles of international cooperation in many respects. They attempted to exclude the Soviet Union from jointly drafting the statute, so that the statute would fully conform to the selfish purposes of the United States. However, this attempt was opposed by many countries. The United States, Britain and other eight countries had to revise their proposals, stipulating that the Soviet Union, Brazil, India, Czechoslovakia and the United States, Britain and other eight countries would jointly participate in the negotiations on drafting the statute of the international agency, and stipulating that the governments of these countries should submit reports to the United Nations General Assembly. However, the issue of China and other countries participating in this organization has not been included due to the obstruction of the United States. Finally, the General Assembly passed the revised eight-nation proposal without opposition, stipulating that twelve countries would jointly draft the statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and convene an international conference in September this year to discuss and adopt the statute of this agency.

	From February to June of this year, the twelve countries that formulated the statute of the international agency held a series of meetings in Washington, and finally adopted the draft statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and issued invitations to hold an international conference on September 20 to discuss the statute.

	The statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency adopted by the recently concluded international conference will make the work of this agency conducive to promoting international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. However, the United States is still obstructing the People's Republic of China from participating in this agency, which will inevitably seriously damage the work of this agency. Representatives from the Soviet Union, India and other countries have pointed this out and expressed their opposition.

	The International Atomic Energy Agency is about to be established. In addition to promoting the use of atomic energy for the well-being of mankind, the forces of peace must continue to strive to ban atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, so that atomic energy can only be used for peaceful purposes.

    原子能国际机构
      9月20日在纽约联合国大厦召开的有八十二个国家参加的和平利用原子能国际会议，于10月23日一致通过了原子能国际机构的章程，并成立了筹备委员会。
    根据已公布的原子能国际机构的章程草案，这个国际机构的主要目的是“促进和扩大原子能对于世界的和平、健康和繁荣所作的贡献”。章程规定由有关国家共同捐出一部分常态铀和原子物质给这个国际机构，并广泛交流各国有关的科学与技术的经验，以促进和平利用原子能的国际合作，特别是帮助不发达国家来改善自己的经济。
    组织上述国际原子能机构的建议，是由美国总统艾森豪威尔在1953年联合国第八届大会上首先提出来的。美国提出组织国际原子能机构的建议，其主要的目的之一，就是为了掩饰自己扩军备战的真相，并用来抵挡世界人民要求裁军和禁止原子武器的压力。
    苏联政府提出了自己的建议，主张：参与协议的各国，将承担起神圣的、无条件的义务，不再使用原子武器、氢武器以及其他大规模毁灭性武器。苏联要求把它的建议同美国的建议同时讨论。
    从1954年1月到9月，苏美两国举行了关于原子能问题的谈判，由于美国政府坚持回避讨论苏联政府提出的禁止原子武器的建议，谈判没有能够达成协议。
    在1954年9月召开的联合国大会第九届会议上，美国同英、法、加拿大等七国提出了联合提案，要求成立和平利用原子能的国际机构。苏联政府对七国提案提出了四项修正案：一、要求大会用一切可能的办法促进原子能方面的重大发现只用于和平用途；二、继续谈判建立和平利用原子能国际机构；三、要求国际机构向联合国和安理会负责；四、邀请一切愿意参加的国家参加国际原子能机构。苏联政府的这些建议得到了许多国家的支持，西方国家不得不在它们的七国联合提案中采纳了苏联的第一、二项修正、并对第三项修正案作了考虑。由于美国的阻挠，苏联提出的第四项修正案没有通过。美国政府明白表示这是为了排斥中华人民共和国的参加。最后，联合国大会第九届会议在11月24日一致通过了经过修正的七国提案。
    到联合国大会第十届会议时，美国为争取主动，和英国、法国、加拿大、比利时、葡萄牙、南非联邦、澳大利亚一起，提出了一个国际原子能机构的章程，分发给大会讨论。这个由他们片面起草的章程，在很多方面不符合国际合作的原则。他们企图排斥苏联来共同起草章程，使章程完全符合于美国的自私目的。但这个企图遭到许多国家的反对。美、英等八国不得不修正他们的提案，规定由苏联、巴西、印度、捷克斯洛伐克四国和美、英等八国一起参加拟订国际机构的章程的谈判，并规定这些国家的政府要向联合国大会提出报告。但是中国及其他一些国家参加这个机构的问题，由于美国的阻挠，仍未列入。最后大会在没有反对的情况下通过了修正后的八国提案，规定十二国共同拟订国际原子能机构章程，并在今年9月召开一次国际会议来讨论和通过这个机构的章程。
    从今年2月到6月，十二个制订国际机构章程的国家在华盛顿举行了一连串会议，最后通过了原子能国际机构的章程草案，并发出邀请在9月20日举行讨论章程的国际会议。
    最近闭幕的国际会议通过的原子能国际机构章程，将使这个机构的工作有利于促进和平利用原子能的国际合作。但是，美国仍在阻挠中华人民共和国参加这个机构，这必然将要严重损害这个机构的工作。苏联、印度及其他国家代表都指出了这一点，并表示反对。
    原子能国际机构就要成立了。和平力量除了推动它利用原子能为人类幸福服务以外，还要继续争取禁止原子武器和氢武器，使原子能只能用于和平用途。
