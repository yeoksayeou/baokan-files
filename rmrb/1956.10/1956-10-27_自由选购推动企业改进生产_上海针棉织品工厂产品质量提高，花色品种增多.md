Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 25th (Reporter Gao Jie): The China Knitwear Company's trial implementation of a free purchasing method has prompted Shanghai knitwear factories to improve product quality and increase variety of designs in a short period of time.

      Old Methods Don't Work
    In July of this year, the China Knitwear Company, targeting winter knitwear products, held its first internal free purchasing and supply conference in Tianjin. Procurement and supply stations for knitwear from all over the country, as well as knitwear industrial departments, sent representatives carrying a large number of samples to the conference for display, allowing sales unit representatives to select and purchase. The Shanghai representatives, who had always believed that their products would have no problem selling, only brought a small number of samples this time. As a result of the selection, 119,000 dozen of Shanghai's planned thermal underwear sets were not sold. Many purchasing representatives criticized Shanghai's knitwear products for having outdated designs and slow improvements.

        Determined to Improve
    This situation greatly shocked the Shanghai knitwear factories. The industrial specialized companies for underwear, towel blankets, socks, etc., immediately held meetings to study how to improve. The underwear industrial department formulated a quality improvement plan from September to December, and at the same time gathered more than 20 experienced tailors from the entire industry to specially design new varieties in preparation for the supply conference for next year's summer undershirts, tank tops, and socks, held in Shanghai in mid-September. At that time, although Shanghai was experiencing a rare heat wave in a century, they still worked hard, sweating profusely, and produced 31 new styles of summer underwear in about a month. They also re-examined and revised the specifications of the original 70+ styles of summer underwear based on consumer feedback. The underwear factories and the towel and blanket industrial department all strengthened the trial production of new products.

    After Improvement, Everyone Rushes to Buy
    In September, the supply conference for summer undershirts, tank tops, and socks was held in Shanghai. This time, the situation was the opposite of the previous supply conference. Purchasing representatives from all over the country generally praised Shanghai's summer underwear and socks for having good designs and beautiful colors, and rushed to purchase them. As a result, the selected purchases of new products such as women's tank tops, colored striped terry shirts, large mesh shirts, Qiao Saibu shirts, and ribbed stretch shirts produced in Shanghai exceeded the actual supply capacity by several to more than ten times.

    Unified Purchase and Sales are Detrimental to Production
    In recent contacts with some leaders of the Shanghai knitwear industrial departments and knitwear factories, the reporter repeatedly heard them talk about how the continued implementation of unified purchase and sales after the joint public-private ownership of these factories was detrimental to production. Many factories producing famous brand products, when the products were subject to unified purchase and sales, gradually lost their original characteristics and reduced the variety of designs because the commercial departments unified the materials and product specifications. Because of unified purchase and sales, factories also did not care about product sales. Only by implementing free purchasing will factories be prompted to continuously improve product quality, increase variety of designs, and better meet the needs of consumers.

### 自由选购推动企业改进生产  上海针棉织品工厂产品质量提高，花色品种增多

    自由选购推动企业改进生产
    上海针棉织品工厂产品质量提高，花色品种增多
    据新华社上海25日电　新华社记者高洁报道：中国针棉织品公司试行自由选购方法，促使上海针棉织品工厂在短期内改进了产品质量，增加了花色品种。
      老一套吃不开
    今年7月份，中国针棉织品公司以冬季用的针棉织品为对象，在天津举行第一次内部自由选购供应会议。各地针棉织品采购供应站和针棉织品工业部门都派人携带大批样品在会上展出，让销售单位代表选购。向来以为产品销路不成问题的上海代表，这次只带去了不多的样品。选购结果，上海计划生产的绒衣裤竟有十一万九千打没有推销出去。很多采购代表批评上海出产的针棉织品花色陈旧，改进太慢。
        下决心改进
    这种情况，给上海针棉织品工厂以很大的震动。内衣、毛巾被单、袜子等工业专业公司都立即召开会议研究如何改进。内衣工业部门拟定了从9月到12月的质量改进计划，同时集中全行业二十多个富有经验的裁剪师，专门设计新品种，迎接9月中旬在上海举行的选购明年夏季汗衫背心和袜子的供应会议。当时，虽然恰逢上海百年来少有的大热天，但他们仍然挥汗工作，在大约一个月时间内做出了三十一种新式夏季内衣，还把原来生产的七十多种夏季内衣规格，重新根据消费者的意见加以审定和修改。各内衣工厂、毛巾被单工业部门都加强了新产品试制工作。
    改进以后，人人争购
    9月份，夏季汗衫背心和袜子的供应会议在上海举行了。这一次一反上次供应会议的情况，各地采购代表普遍赞扬上海的夏季内衣和袜子花样好，颜色美，纷纷选购。结果各地选购上海生产的女人汗背心、彩条毛巾衫、大网眼衫、乔赛布衫、罗纹弹力衫等新产品，都超过实际供应能力几倍到十几倍。
    统购包销不利于生产
    记者最近在同上海针棉织品工业部门和针棉织品工厂一些负责人接触中，一再听到他们谈起在这些工厂公私合营以后，继续实行统购包销是不利于生产的。许多生产名牌货的工厂在产品实行统购包销的时候，因为商业部门统一了用料和产品规格，产品原有的特点便逐渐消失，花色品种逐渐减少，因为统购包销，工厂也不关心产品销售情况。只有实行自由选购，才会促使工厂不断提高产品质量，增加花色品种，更好地满足消费者的需要。
