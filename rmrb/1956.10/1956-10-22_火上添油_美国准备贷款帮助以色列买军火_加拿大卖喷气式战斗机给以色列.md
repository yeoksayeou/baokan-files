Adding Fuel to the Fire

Xinhua News Agency, 20th -- According to a report by Robert Allen, the Washington correspondent for the "New York Post," the Export-Import Bank of the United States will grant Israel a $75 million loan within a few weeks.

Allen pointed out that although the money is not to be used to purchase arms or other military equipment, but to buy American goods, "this large loan will have a significant indirect impact on Israel's arms purchases," because "with this $75 million loan, [Israel] can extract other funds to accelerate the purchase of urgently needed aircraft, tanks, artillery and other armaments from countries such as Canada and France."

Allen said that this loan has been approved by the US President, Secretary of State, and Secretary of the Treasury, as well as the President and most directors of the Export-Import Bank. Moreover, it is said that New York State Attorney General Javits, who has been vigorously advocating for the loan to Israel, has received assurances from the President and Secretary of State regarding the granting of the loan.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th -- Ottawa News: With the approval of the Canadian government, Canadair Ltd. of Montreal, Canada, has signed a contract with the Israeli government to sell twenty-four Sabre jet fighters. All of these Sabre aircraft will be delivered to Israel before April next year. The exchange value is $7.2 million.

According to an Associated Press report: The Canadian government's agreement to sell Sabre jet aircraft to Israel was with the prior consent of the United States and the United Kingdom.

    新华社20日讯　据“纽约邮报”驻华盛顿记者罗伯特·艾伦报道，美国进出口银行将在数周内给以色列七千五百万美元贷款。
    艾伦指出，这笔钱虽然不是用来购买军火或其他军事装备，而是用来购买美国商品的，“但是，这笔大贷款将对以色列购买武器的问题有重大的间接影响”，因为，“由于有这笔七千五百万美元的贷款，（以色列）就可以把其他款项抽出来，用来加速向加拿大和法国等国增购急需的飞机、坦克、大炮和其他军火。”
    艾伦说，这笔贷款已经得到美国总统、国务卿和财政部长以及进口银行总裁和大多数董事的同意。而且，据说竭力主张给以色列贷款的纽约州检察长维茨已经得到总统和国务卿关于给予贷款的保证。
    新华社20日讯　渥太华消息：在加拿大政府批准下，加拿大蒙特利尔的卡纳戴尔公司同以色列政府签订了一个出售二十四架佩刀式喷气战斗机的合同。这些佩刀式飞机将在明年4月以前全部交付给以色列。兑价额为七百二十万美元。
    据美联社消息说：加拿大政府同意出售佩刀式喷气飞机给以色列是事先得到美国和英国的赞同的。
