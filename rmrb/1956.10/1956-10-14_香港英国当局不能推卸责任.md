Observer's Commentary:

    The riots instigated by Kuomintang secret agents in the Kowloon area since October 10th have not only not been quelled to this day, but are continuing to escalate. The frantic disturbances have spread to Kowloon's industrial areas and other regions, where large numbers of factories have been destroyed and burned, and large numbers of residents have been robbed and murdered. The Kuomintang secret agents, at the end of their rope, have lost their humanity, and the entire Kowloon area has become a lawless and terrifying world. At the same time, there are signs that the riots are spreading to the Hong Kong district, with batches of secret agents having entered the Hong Kong district, which is already under serious threat.

    But strangely, faced with this very serious situation, the Hong Kong British authorities, who bear absolute responsibility for the safety of life and property of Chinese and foreign residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon and for social order, have not only failed to take effective measures, but have also engaged in highly suspicious actions. The Hong Kong authorities initially distorted the riots instigated by Kuomintang secret agents, claiming that they were conflicts between two factions of Chinese or factional struggles between members of left-wing and right-wing movements, attempting to shirk their responsibility; then they claimed that the riots were planned and directed by local "secret societies," attempting to exonerate the Kuomintang secret agents who were the instigators of the riots. Now the Hong Kong British authorities are completely imitating the tone of American and Chiang Kai-shek news agencies, spreading lies and distorting the truth. The riots were entirely planned and instigated by Kuomintang secret agents, which has been fully proven by many ironclad facts and cannot be distorted by any lies. However, Hong Kong Governor Grantham, in a statement in Tokyo on October 13, actually described the riots as a "Communist event against the Kuomintang." He also believed that the riots did not pose any threat to Hong Kong. This absurd statement is not only intended to shirk the Hong Kong British authorities' responsibility for the safety of residents, but also to shift the blame for the Kuomintang secret agents' crimes onto the Chinese people. This is open protection of Kuomintang secret agents and open slander against the Chinese people. This cannot but arouse the great indignation of the Chinese people. People have ample reason to suspect: What exactly is the intention of the Hong Kong British authorities in adopting such an attitude? Why are they holding such a protective, shielding, and even condoning attitude towards Kuomintang secret agents? What is the relationship between the Hong Kong British authorities and the Kuomintang secret agents?

    Now we seem to see every day the bloodstains of our Chinese compatriots being murdered in Kowloon, and we seem to hear their cries every day. We can never ignore the pain and disaster they are suffering. We demand that the Hong Kong British authorities change these suspicious actions and immediately take effective steps to completely stop the riots and illegal activities of Kuomintang secret agents. Otherwise, the Hong Kong authorities must bear the responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

### 香港英国当局不能推卸责任

    香港英国当局不能推卸责任
    国民党特务分子从10月10日起在九龙地区制造的暴乱，至今不但没有平息，而且还在继续扩大。疯狂的骚动已经扩展到九龙的工业区和其他地区，那里的大批工厂被捣毁，被焚烧，大批的居民遭受抢劫和残杀。穷途末路的国民党特务分子丧失了人性，整个九龙地区成了无法无天的恐怖世界。同时，暴乱还有向香港区扩展的迹象，成批特务已进入香港区，那里已经受到严重威胁。
    但奇怪的是，面对这种十分严重的形势，对于港九中外居民生命财产和社会秩序的安全负有绝对责任的香港英国当局，不但仍然没有采取有效的措施，而且出现了令人十分可疑的行动。香港当局初则把国民党特务分子制造的暴乱，歪曲地说成是两派华人的冲突或左翼同右翼运动成员之间的派系斗争，企图推卸自己应负的责任；继则又把这个暴乱说成是当地的“秘密帮会”计划和指挥的，企图为这一暴乱的祸首国民党特务分子开脱罪行。现在香港英国当局竟然完全摹仿美蒋通讯社的口吻，散布谎言，颠倒黑白。这次暴乱事件完全是由国民党特务分子有计划地制造出来的，这是已经为许多铁的事实所充分证明，不是任何谎言所能歪曲得了的。可是香港总督葛量洪10月13日在东京发表谈话，竟把这次暴乱说成是“共产党对国民党的事件”。他并且认为，暴乱并没有对香港构成什么威胁。这种荒谬绝伦的说法不仅是要推卸香港英国当局对居民安全应负的责任，而且想把国民党特务分子的罪恶转嫁到中国人民身上来。这是公开对国民党特务分子的包庇，这是公开对中国人民的诬蔑。这不能不引起中国人民的极大愤慨。人们有充分的理由怀疑：香港英国当局采取这种态度的居心究竟何在？究竟为了什么要对国民党特务分子抱着如此袒护、包庇甚至纵容的态度？香港英国当局和国民党特务分子究竟有什么关系？
    现在我们每天都仿佛看到在九龙的中国同胞被残杀的血迹，每天都仿佛听到他们的呼声。我们对他们所蒙受的痛苦和灾难是决不能置之不顾的。我们要求香港英国当局改变这种令人可疑的行动，立即采取有效步骤，完全制止国民党特务分子的暴乱和非法活动。否则，由此而产生的一切后果的责任，必须由香港当局担负。
