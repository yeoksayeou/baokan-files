Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th – Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama and his entourage arrived in Moscow by plane this afternoon.

Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin, First Deputy Chairman Pervukhin, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Gromyko, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fedrin, and heads of diplomatic missions from various countries in the Soviet Union welcomed the Japanese delegation at the airport.

Accompanied by Bulganin, Hatoyama reviewed the guard of honor and then delivered a short speech. He said that he had come to Moscow to conduct negotiations on the restoration of normal relations between the Soviet Union and Japan. The fact that the Soviet Union and Japan are still formally in a state of war is a major obstacle to world peace. He deeply regretted this. Since last year, the two countries have held negotiations on the restoration of normal relations, but these negotiations have not yet achieved good results. Therefore, both sides should exchange views and resolve this issue.

It is reported that negotiations on the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations will begin on October 15.

"Pravda" and "Izvestia" both published editorials today commenting on the issue of normalizing Soviet-Japanese relations.

    日本首相鸠山到达莫斯科
    苏日谈判将在15日开始
    新华社莫斯科12日电　日本首相鸠山和他的随行人员在今日下午乘飞机到达莫斯科。
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁、第一副主席别尔乌辛，外交部第一副部长葛罗米柯、副部长费德林和各国驻苏外交使团使节等都在机场上欢迎日本代表团。
    鸠山在布尔加宁的陪同下检阅了仪仗队以后，发表了简短的讲话。他说，他是为了进行关于恢复苏日两国正常关系的谈判来到莫斯科的。苏日两国目前形式上还存在着战争状态，这对世界和平是一个很大的妨碍。他对此深感歉然。从去年起，两国曾经进行了恢复正常关系的谈判，但这种谈判还未得到良好的效果，因此两方面应该交换意见，并且解决这个问题。
    有消息说：苏日关系正常化的谈判将在10月15日开始。
    “真理报”和“消息报”今天都发表了社论，评论苏日关系正常化的问题。
