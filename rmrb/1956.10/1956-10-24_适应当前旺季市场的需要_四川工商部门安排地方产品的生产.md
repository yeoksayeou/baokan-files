Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 22nd: Sichuan Province's state-owned commercial and local industrial departments have recently collaborated closely to arrange the production of 175 kinds of local industrial products and 72 kinds of locally produced and sold handicraft products to meet the needs of the current peak season market. These products include daily necessities, knitwear, small hardware, machine parts, chemical products, and so on.

The products from Chengdu and Chongqing, where local industry is more concentrated, have been well-received by the masses this year due to improved quality and a greater variety of designs and colors. Factories also have a relatively large potential for increased production, but they face difficulties due to insufficient raw material supply. This time, the state-owned department stores, knitwear, and cultural supplies commercial units in the two cities helped factories solve the problem of insufficient raw materials such as steel, leather, and cotton yarn. Both parties smoothly arranged the increased production plan for the fourth quarter for more than 120 products. This year, Sichuan Province has a great need for cultural paper. After arrangements by the commercial and industrial departments, the province's local paper industry will increase production by 1,543 tons of paper in addition to completing the annual production plan. The raw materials needed for the increased production, such as pulp, have been jointly addressed by both industry and commerce. Some medium-sized and small cities in Sichuan Province produce soap with poor quality, leading to stockpiles, while Chongqing's soap production cannot meet demand. During the arrangement of the production plan, both industry and commerce adjusted the proportion of regional production based on the principles of raw material supply and encouraging advanced practices, and expanded the soap production in Chongqing.

The person in charge of the Sichuan Provincial Commercial Department said that many daily necessities in Sichuan Province rely on supplies from other provinces. Recently, due to tight transportation into Sichuan, general Shanghai products, if not delayed along the way, take about a month to reach Sichuan consumers after multiple transits. However, local products can reach consumers in about ten days after being produced in the factory. Therefore, expanding the production of local products plays a significant role in ensuring supply for the current peak season market.

    适应当前旺季市场的需要
    四川工商部门安排地方产品的生产
    新华社成都22日电　四川省国营商业同地方工业部门最近密切协作，安排了一百七十五种地方工业产品和七十二种属于当地生产当地销售的手工业产品的生产，以适应当前旺季市场的需要。这批产品包括日用百货、针棉织品以及小五金、机器配件、化工用品等。
    地方工业较集中的成都、重庆两地的产品，今年以来由于质量提高和花色品种增多，受到群众欢迎，工厂增产的潜力也比较大，但是因为原料供应不足，增产有困难。这次两地的国营百货、针棉织品和文化用品等三个商业单位，就协助工厂解决钢材、皮革、棉纱等原料不足的问题，双方顺利地安排了一百二十多种产品第四季度的增产计划。今年四川省对文化用纸的需要量很大，经过商业和工业部门的安排，全省地方造纸工业在完成全年生产计划以外，还要增产一千五百四十三吨纸张，增产所需要的纸浆等原料，已由工商双方共同设法解决。四川省部分中、小城市出产的肥皂因质量差，有积压，而重庆出产的肥皂又感不足。这次工商双方在安排生产计划时，根据原料供应和鼓励先进的原则，调整了地区生产的比例，扩大了重庆市的肥皂生产量。
    四川省商业部门负责人说，四川省许多日用百货要靠省外供应，最近由于入川交通运输情况紧张，一般上海产品，如果沿途不耽搁，经过层层周转，也要一个月左右才能同四川消费者见面，而地方产品从工厂生产出来只要十天左右就可以同消费者见面，因此扩大地方产品的生产，对做好目前旺季市场的供应工作有很大的作用。
