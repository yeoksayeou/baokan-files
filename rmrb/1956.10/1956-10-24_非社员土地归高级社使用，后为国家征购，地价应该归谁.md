    Land of Non-Members Used by Advanced Cooperatives, Later Purchased by the State: Who Should Receive the Land Price?
    Question: My township has already achieved advanced collectivization. I work in the city, my family has no labor force, and I have not joined the cooperative, but my land is used by the agricultural cooperative. This year, the state needs to purchase land for construction, and my land has been purchased, but the land price has not yet been settled. I would like to ask if the land price should belong to me? Xiao Gang

    Answer: According to Article 15 of the "Model Charter for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives," people engaged in urban occupations who hand over their land in rural areas to agricultural producers' cooperatives for use still retain ownership of the land. Therefore, if the land is purchased by the state, the land price should belong to the original owner.

    非社员土地归高级社使用，后为国家征购，地价应该归谁
    问：本乡已实现高级合作化。本人在城市工作，家中无劳力，没有入社，土地交给农业社使用。今年国家因建设需要征购土地，本人的土地已被征购，但地价迄无着落，请问地价应不应该归本人？　肖
　岗
    答：按照“高级农业生产合作社示范章程”第十五条的规定，从事城市职业的人们，他们把自己所有在农村的土地交给农业生产合作社使用，仍然保留了土地所有权。因此，土地由国家征购，地价应归本主。
