    Fengman Hydropower Station Completes Major Reconstruction Project

    The major reconstruction projects of the Fengman Hydropower Station during the First Five-Year Plan have now been fully completed. With the comprehensive assistance of the Soviet Union, the installed capacity of the Fengman Hydropower Station this year has increased approximately threefold compared to 1952. After the entire reconstruction task of the hydropower station is completed, the power generation capacity will reach 567,000 kilowatts.

    The heart of the hydropower station—the hydro-turbine generator units—have been installed.

    The newly built transformer substation has begun operation. All of this equipment was supplied by the Soviet Union.

    丰满水电站完成主要改建工程
    丰满水电站在第一个五年计划期间改建的主要工程，现在已经全部完成。在苏联的全面援助下，丰满水电站今年的装机容量比1952年增加约三倍。水电站的全部改建任务完成后，发电能力将达到五十六万七千瓩。
