　　Not Only Safety, But Also Increased Production Efficiency
　　Xu Zhuoran
　　On August 29th, the People's Daily published on its second page the news of the No. 1 rotary kiln of the joint state-private Nanjing Jiangnan Cement Plant operating safely for 550 days. This was the highest national record for long-term safe operation of a cement kiln, created by the workers' creative learning from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and the Guangzhou Cement Plant. It reversed the backward state of this plant since 1954, where the highest operating cycle was 85 days, the lowest only 9 days, and the average was 38 days. This improved the enterprise's management and technical level and created enormous wealth for the country. This experience should be affirmed. However, it should also be pointed out that this experience is not comprehensive enough. The most prominent manifestation is the failure to complete the national plan for hourly output. Last year, the planned hourly output of No. 1 kiln was 16.75 tons, which was 100% completed. This year, however, the planned hourly output of clinker used for ordinary cement in the first quarter was 16.82 tons, but the actual output only reached 16.02 tons, of which only 14.76 tons were achieved in March; the planned hourly output in the second quarter was 17.49 tons, with an actual completion of 17.21 tons; and only 98.95% of the planned hourly output was achieved in July. It is not difficult to see that the actual completion of the hourly output plan for the No. 1 kiln of the Jiangnan Cement Plant is declining. The first quarter of this year decreased by 2.91% compared with the same period last year, and the second quarter also decreased by 0.34% compared with the same period last year.
　　The quality of clinker produced has also declined. According to statistics, the 28-day compressive strength of clinker per square centimeter decreased by 13.84% in June compared to January.
　　The purpose of promoting advanced experience is to better complete the various national plan targets. While the No. 1 kiln of the Jiangnan Cement Plant was creating a new national record for safe operation, it had not completed the hourly output plan and had actually decreased compared to the same period last year, and the product quality had declined. This is obviously a shortcoming.
　　To analyze the reasons, the main one is that the No. 1 rotary kiln of the Jiangnan Cement Plant did not well combine the promotion of advanced experience in rapid rotary kilns in the process of promoting long-term operation experience. As early as 1953, the former Building Materials Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry (now reorganized into the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, hereinafter referred to as the Ministry of Building Materials) instructed cement plants across the country to strive to promote the three major advanced experiences of long-term safe operation, rapid rotary kilns, and water cooling of cement kilns. There is an extremely close connection between them. Among them, rapid rotary kilns are an important advanced experience accumulated over many years in the Soviet cement industry. It can not only promote the stability of the kiln's operating system, but also effectively increase the hourly output of the cement kiln. For example, after the Jinxi and Fushun cement plants promoted it, the hourly output increased by about 8%; after the rotation speed of the Guangzhou Cement Plant's kiln was increased from 0.93 revolutions per minute to 1.15 revolutions per minute, and the rapid rotation rate increased to more than 90%, the hourly output increased by more than one ton; the Huaxin Cement Plant is even more prominent, the kiln's rotation speed can often reach 1.3 revolutions per minute, and the rapid rotation rate can also reach more than 96%. However, the Jiangnan Cement Plant has neglected the promotion of this experience in the past. The rotation speed of No. 1 kiln is relatively slow, especially the range of change in the kiln's rotation speed is very large, with the lowest being only forty revolutions per hour and the highest being seventy revolutions per hour. The rapid rotation rate is often only 65% to 70%. The plant has rarely actively improved in this regard.
　　In order to correct the above two shortcomings, the leadership has given a series of help, and the Jiangnan Cement Plant has begun to promote the advanced experience of rapid rotary kilns.
　　The No. 1 kiln of the Jiangnan Cement Plant has rich experience in hanging kiln skins, protecting kiln skins, and equipment maintenance during long-term safe operation. Especially the experience of unifying the technical operation of the three shifts, timely preventing and handling ring formation, and closely combining the long-term operation and water cooling experiences is worth learning carefully by cement plants across the country. However, the shortcomings of the No. 1 rotary kiln of the Jiangnan Cement Plant should be avoided. We must remember: Long-term safe operation is to better complete the national plan, not to simply create safety records!

　　不仅要安全还要提高生产效率
    徐卓然
    8月29日，人民日报第二版发表了公私合营南京江南水泥厂一号旋窑长期安全运转五百五十天的消息。这是职工们创造性地学习苏联和广州水泥厂的先进经验以后所创造的全国水泥窑长期安全运转的最高纪录。它从此扭转了这个厂从1954年以来，运转周期最高是八十五天，最低只有九天，平均是三十八天的落后状态，从而提高了企业的管理和技术水平，并为国家创造了巨大财富。这个经验是应该肯定的。但也应该指出，这个经验不够全面。突出的表现，是没有完成单位小时定额的国家计划。去年一号窑的计划小时定额是16.75吨，百分之百地完成了。而今年，第一季普通水泥所用熟料的小时定额计划是16.82吨，实际只达到16.02吨，其中3月份仅达到14.76吨；第二季小时定额计划是17.49吨，实际完成17.21吨；7月份也只完成小时定额计划的98.95％。这就不难看出，江南水泥厂一号窑小时定额计划实际完成情况是下降的。今年第一季度比去年同期下降2.91％，第二季也比去年同时期下降0.34％。
    生产的熟料的质量也下降。据统计，每平方公分熟料二十八天的耐压强度，6月份比1月份下降了13.84％。
    推广先进经验的目的，是为了更好地完成国家各项计划指标。江南水泥厂一号窑在创造安全运转全国新纪录的同时一直未完成小时定额计划，而且比去年同时期实际完成有所降低，产品质量下降，这显然是一个缺点。
    要分析原因，主要是江南水泥厂一号旋窑在推广长期运转经验中，没很好结合推广快速转窑先进经验。早在1953年原重工业部建筑材料工业管理局（现已改组为建筑材料工业部，以下简称建材部），即指示全国各水泥厂，努力推广水泥窑长期安全运转，快速转窑和水冷却三大先进经验。它们之间有着极其密切的联系。其中快速转窑是苏联水泥工业中多年积累的一项重要先进经验，它不仅能够促使窑的操作制度的稳定，还可以有效地提高水泥窑小时产量。如锦西和抚顺等水泥厂推广以后，单位小时产量提高8％左右；广州水泥厂窑的转数由每分钟0.93转提高到1.15转，快转率提高到90％以上之后，小时产量提高一吨多；华新水泥厂更加突出，窑的转数每分钟经常可以达到1.3转，快速率也可达到96％以上。而江南水泥厂过去却忽视了这项经验的推广工作，一号窑的转速比较慢，尤其是窑的转数变动范围很大，每小时最低才转四十多转，高者转七十多转，快转率经常只有65％—70％。这个厂对于这方面很少积极改进。
    为了纠正以上两方面的缺点，领导方面曾经给予一系列的帮助，江南水泥厂已经开始推广快速转窑先进经验。
    江南水泥厂一号窑，在长期安全运转中在挂窑皮、保护窑皮及设备检修维护工作上，都有着丰富的经验，尤其是在统一三班技术操作，及时预防和处理结圈，长期运转和水冷却两条经验紧密结合的经验，更是值得全国各水泥厂认真学习。但是，应该避免江南水泥厂一号旋窑的缺点。我们要记着：长期安全运转是为了更好地完成国家计划，而不是为了单纯创造安全纪录！
