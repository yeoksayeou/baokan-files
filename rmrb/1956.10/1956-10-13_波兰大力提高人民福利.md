    Poland Vigorously Improves People's Welfare

    Building Housing for the Working People
    More than two million houses have been built in the cities and countryside of People's Poland since the war. In the new Five-Year Plan, the scale of housing construction will be further expanded. It is planned to build no less than 300,000 houses annually.
    More than twenty residential areas have been built in Warsaw.
    In Silesia, the country's largest industrial zone, many new houses have been built. Miners, metallurgical workers, and chemical workers in Silesia have received 9,757 houses. In Silesia, socialist cities—Nowy Tychy, Nowa Dąbrowa, and dozens of workers' residential areas are growing rapidly.
    In other cities across the country, thousands of working people's families have moved into new houses.

     Increasing Pensions
    The Presidium of the Government of the Polish People's Republic recently adopted supplementary regulations regarding the general pension system for working people and their families.
    These supplementary regulations make significant changes to the pension system, further improving the material living conditions of pension recipients. For example, those who rely solely on pensions will receive a special allowance equivalent to half of their current pension. The pension amount will reach 1,200 zlotys. The method of calculating wages as the basis for determining the amount of pension has also been changed. Previously, the average wage for the twelve months prior to applying for a pension was used as the basis for calculating the pension, which was unfavorable to pension recipients. The current supplementary regulations stipulate that, in addition to the original calculation method, if the applicant deems it necessary, they can use the average of their wage income during several years of their previous ten years of work as the basis for calculation.
    In addition, there are other new regulations. For example, orphans without support will receive an allowance of 100 zlotys. Widows who are 55 years of age or older can receive family pensions.
  Caring for Citizens Who Have Lost Their Ability to Work
    The state has shown great concern for those who have lost their ability to work. In addition to pensions and subsidies that can be obtained in the event of temporary difficulties, the state has also widely established various health care and elderly care institutions throughout the country.
    Currently, there are 169 nursing homes and 29 "pensioner's homes" in Poland. Most of the nursing homes are located in the former villas of landlords in the countryside. During the Five-Year Plan from 1956 to 1960, it is planned to establish 27 new pensioner's homes.
    In order to help some patients who are not suitable for hospital treatment to recover their health, 67 special medical care institutions have also been established.
    In Poland, four specialized institutions have also been established for blind people who have lost their ability to work, twelve institutions for people with chronic mental illnesses, and thirty-four institutions for people with intellectual disabilities.

    波兰大力提高人民福利
    为劳动人民建造住宅
    战后在人民波兰的城市和农村里，建造了二百多万间房子。在新的五年计划中，住宅建筑的规模更扩大了。预定每年建造的住宅不下于三十万间房子。
    在华沙已经建造起二十多个住宅区。
    在国内最大的工业区西里西亚，盖起了许多新住宅。西里西亚的矿工、冶金工人、化学工人得到了九千七百五十七间房子。在西里西亚，社会主义城市——诺维·推赫、诺瓦·董勃罗瓦和几十个工人住宅区迅速地成长起来了。
    在国内其他各城市也有几千个劳动人民的家庭搬进了新住宅。
     增加抚恤金
    波兰人民共和国政府主席团最近通过了关于劳动人民及其家属的一般抚恤金制度的补充条例。
    这些补充条例对于抚恤金制度作了重大的修改，进一步改善了抚恤金领取人的物质生活状况。例如，对于专靠抚恤金生活的人将给与一笔特别的津贴，这笔津贴相当于他们目前所领的抚恤金的一半。抚恤金额将达到一千二百兹罗提。作为确定抚恤金数目的基础的工薪计算办法，也有了改变。从前是以申请抚恤金前十二个月的平均工资作为计算抚恤金的根据的，这对领取抚恤金的人是不利的。现在的补充条例规定：除了原有的计算方法以外，如果申请者认为必要，可以把他前十年工作期间的几年内的工资收入的平均数作为计算根据。
    此外，还有一些其他的新规定。例如，对于无依无靠的孤儿给与一百兹罗提的津贴。凡是年满五十五岁的寡妇可以领取家庭抚恤金。
  关怀丧失劳动能力的公民
    国家对丧失劳动能力的人表现了很大的关怀。除了抚恤金和因暂时困难可以领取的补助金以外，国家还在全国范围内广泛设立了各种卫生保健和养老的机构。
    现在，在波兰有一百六十九所养老院和二十九个“抚恤金领取者之家”。养老院大多设在农村旧日地主的别墅里。1956年到1960年的五年计划期间，预计要成立二十七所新的抚恤金领取者之家。
    为了帮助一些不适于住在医院治疗的病人恢复健康，现在还设立了六十七所特别的医护机构。
    在波兰，还为丧失了劳动能力的盲人设立了四个专门机构，为慢性精神病患者设有十二个机构，为智力发育不健全的人设有三十四个机构。
