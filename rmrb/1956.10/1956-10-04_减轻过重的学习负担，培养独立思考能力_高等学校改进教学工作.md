Alleviating Excessive Study Load and Cultivating Independent Thinking Ability
Universities and Colleges Improve Teaching Work

(Our report) Since the beginning of the new academic year, in order to alleviate the excessive study load on students and cultivate their ability to think and work independently, many universities and colleges in various regions have actively adopted some relatively effective methods to further improve teaching methods and teaching quality.

Many schools, in accordance with the spirit of the summer forum of university and college presidents and academic affairs directors, as well as the temporary measures taken by the Ministry of Higher Education to overcome the phenomenon of excessive student learning burden and improve education quality, have appropriately revised the current teaching plans in light of the specific conditions of the schools. The main contents of the revision of the teaching plan are: reducing class hours; streamlining the categories of courses, canceling some unnecessary courses, reducing the weight of some minor courses, or merging courses with overlapping content; turning some courses into electives; adding new courses; and strengthening experimental classes, production internships, etc. In addition, some schools have also revised some teaching syllabuses, appropriately reduced the number of homework sessions and classroom discussions, and changed the past practice of using oral exams for all courses, some courses have been changed to written exams, and guidance for students' self-study has been strengthened. In this way, in some schools, the excessively tense state of students' learning life has been initially changed, giving students more time for self-study to concentrate on learning important courses, creating favorable conditions for cultivating students' ability to think and work independently. Peking University has recently studied the issue of cultivating students' ability to think and work independently, reviewed the teaching work of the past few years, and revised the teaching plans of various majors. After these teaching plans have been revised, the class hours per week for first and second year students are generally 24 to 28 hours, and the number of courses per semester has been reduced to 5 to 6, with a maximum of no more than 7; the class hours for students in the upper grades are even less. In order to cultivate students' ability to distinguish right from wrong, Peking University will also offer a series of new elective courses for senior students.

Tsinghua University plans to spend one academic year studying the issue of teaching plans, with the Academic Affairs Office and various departments conducting separate research on the needs of basic courses and professional courses to determine the appropriate proportion. They also plan to study the ratio of students' class time to extracurricular study time, as well as the teaching forms of homework sessions, course design, and graduation design. Tsinghua University will also offer new majors such as electronic computers, operations research, high-voltage technology, and industrial thermal engineering.

Fudan University's eleven departments have all made varying degrees of revisions to the original teaching plans. Educational internships have been canceled, and half of the class hours of education courses have been streamlined. Except for the Department of Foreign Languages, other departments have discontinued the course "Teaching Methods." The class hours of political courses, which were too heavy, have also been appropriately streamlined. For example, the political courses for science majors have been reduced from a total of 616 class hours in the past to 362 class hours. The Department of Mathematics has also reduced the number of homework sessions that restricted students' independent study due to the excessive number of hours. The Department of Chinese Language has streamlined the excessive number of academic papers. After these new measures, the number of class hours per week for students has generally been reduced, increasing self-study time. For example, the number of class hours per week for first-year students in the Department of Physics has been reduced from 31 to 27; the number of class hours per week for first-year students in the Department of Chinese Language has been reduced from 28 to 22. As the grade level increases, students' self-study time will also increase.

After the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics revised the current teaching plan, the number of class hours for students this semester has been reduced. For example, the number of class hours per week for first, second, and third year students has been reduced from about 29 in the past to 25; for fourth year students, it has been reduced to 22. Some courses have also been reduced in weight and class hours. For example, the total number of class hours per semester for the course "Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism" has been reduced from 238 to 102; "The Foundation of the State and Legal Rights" has been reduced from 98 to 72. At the same time, some elective courses and lectures have been added for senior students.

Northeast People's University streamlined the curriculum in three aspects: First, some courses were canceled, such as mathematics teaching methods and outlines of cartography and descriptive geometry for mathematics majors, and political economics for four-year science majors; second, some courses were changed from required courses to optional courses, such as Chinese history for Chinese language and literature majors, and Chinese literary history and history of philosophy for history majors. In addition, some courses have also been merged, such as number theory for mathematics majors being merged into advanced algebra and modern algebra; and "History of the Soviet State and Law" for law majors being merged into "General History of State and Law." The various departments have also made some changes to various teaching methods.

In addition, universities and normal colleges in Wuhan, Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, Henan and other places are also actively studying ways to improve teaching methods, revise teaching plans, and find ways to alleviate the excessive study burden of students.

Through these effective efforts, various colleges and universities will achieve new achievements in cultivating students' ability to think and work independently.

    减轻过重的学习负担，培养独立思考能力
    高等学校改进教学工作
    本报讯　为了减轻学生过重的学习负担，培养学生的独立思考和独立工作能力，新学年开始以来，各地许多高等学校积极地采取了一些比较有效的办法，进一步改进教学方法和提高教学质量。
    许多学校根据高等学校院校长和教务长暑期座谈会的精神，以及高等教育部为克服学生学习负担过重的现象提高教育质量所采取的若干临时措施，结合学校具体情况，适当地修改了现行的教学计划。修改教学计划的主要内容是：减少了上课时数；精简了课程门类，取消一些不必要的课程，减轻一些次要课程的分量或者把内容重复的课程合并起来；把部分课程改成选修课；增设新的课程；加强实验课、生产实习等。此外，有些学校对于部分教学大纲也作了修改，还适当地减少了习题课和课堂讨论的时数，改变了过去考试一律采用口试的作法，有些课程改为笔试，并且加强对学生自学的指导。这样，在一些学校里，已经初步改变了学生学习生活过度紧张的状况，使学生有了较多的自学时间能够集中精力学好重要课程，为培养学生独立思考和独立工作能力创造了有利条件。北京大学在最近一个时期研究了有关培养学生独立思考和独立工作能力的问题，检查了几年来的教学工作，并且对各个专业的教学计划进行了一次修改。这些教学计划经过修改以后，一、二年级学生每周上课时数一般是二十四小时到二十八小时，每学期的课程门类减至五门到六门，最多的不超过七门；三年级以上的各年级学生上课时数更少。北京大学为了培养学生明辨是非的能力，还将为高年级学生开设一系列的新的选修课程。
    清华大学准备用一学年的时间研究有关教学计划的问题，由教务处和各个系分别对基础课和专业课的需要进行研究，确定合适的比重。他们还准备对学生上课和课外学习时间的比例问题，以及习题课、课程设计和毕业设计等教学形式的问题进行研究。清华大学还将开设电子计算机、运用学、高压技术、工业热工学等新的专业。
    复旦大学全校十一个系，对原有的教学计划都作了不同程度的修改。取消了教育实习，精简了教育学课程的一半学时，除了外文系以外，其他各系停开了“教学法”这门课程。对于分量过重的政治课的学时也作了适当的精简。如理科各专业的政治课，由过去总时数六百十六学时减少到三百六十二学时。数学系对于因时数过多而束缚学生独立钻研的习题课，也减少了时数。中文系则精简了过多的学年论文，经过这些新措施，学生每周上课时数一般都减少了，增加了自学时间，如物理系一年级每周上课时数由三十一学时减为二十七学时；中文系一年级每周上课时数由二十八学时减为二十二学时。随着年级升高，学生的自学时间还要增多。
    上海财经学院对现行教学计划修改以后，这学期学生上课时数已经减少，如一、二、三年级每周上课时数，由过去的二十九学时左右减到二十五学时；四年级则已减到二十二学时。有些课程还减轻了分量和上课时数，如“马克思列宁主义基础”这门课程，每学期上课总时数从二百三十八学时减到一百零二学时；“国家与法权的基础”则从九十八学时减到七十二学时。同时还为高年级学生增设了一些选修课程和讲座。
    东北人民大学从三方面精简了课程：首先取消部分课程，如数学专业取消了数学教学法、制图学与画法几何概要，理科各专业取消了四年制的政治经济学；其次把部分课程由必修课改为加修课，如汉语言文学专业的中国史，历史专业的中国文学史、哲学史等，都改为加修课了。另外，还合并了部分课程，如数学专业的数论分别并入高等代数和近世代数中；法律专业的“苏联国家与法的历史”并入“国家与法的通史”中。各系对各种教学方式，也作了某些改变。
    此外，武汉、山东、湖北、湖南、河南等地的高等学校和高等师范学校也都在积极研究改进教学方法，修改教学计划，设法减轻学生过重的学习负担。
    各院校经过这些有效的努力，在培养学生独立思考和独立工作能力方面，将获得新的成绩。
