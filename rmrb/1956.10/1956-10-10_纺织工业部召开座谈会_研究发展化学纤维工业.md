　　Ministry of Textile Industry Holds Symposium
　　Researching and Developing the Chemical Fiber Industry
    (Our Newspaper) The Ministry of Textile Industry recently convened a symposium on chemical fibers, attended by representatives from more than a dozen units including the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, and the Ministry of Food Industry.

    At the meeting, relevant personnel from the Ministry of Chemical Industry and the Ministry of Textile Industry introduced the international development of the chemical fiber industry and the work plan of the Ministry of Textile Industry for establishing the chemical fiber industry in the future. Currently, the Andong Artificial Fiber Factory is being restored and rebuilt and is expected to be put into production in the second half of 1957. This factory specializes in the production of artificial wool, with an annual output of about 4,000 tons. A synthetic fiber intermediate factory will also be put into production in 1958. This factory will produce staple fiber and some filament. Another long fiber factory, namely the First Artificial Fiber Factory, will be put into production in 1959, with an annual output of 10,000 tons of rayon.

    Chemical fibers have a wide range of uses. Artificial fiber fabrics are more uniform and beautiful than products woven from cotton and wool. Fishing nets woven from rayon are stronger than ordinary fishing nets. A car tire made with cotton yarn as cord fabric can only travel 25,000 kilometers, while a car tire made with rayon as cord fabric can travel 50,000 to 100,000 kilometers. In the past, the artificial fibers needed in our country all relied on imports. After our artificial fiber factory is completed, it will save a sum of foreign exchange.

    The meeting particularly emphasized the importance of chemical fiber research, especially in the source of raw materials, and it is necessary to cooperate with the domestic resource situation to find various usable natural cellulose raw materials.

　　纺织工业部召开座谈会
　　研究发展化学纤维工业
    本报讯　纺织工业部最近召开了化学纤维座谈会，参加座谈会的有中国科学院、化学工业部、轻工业部、食品工业部等十几个单位。
    会上由化学工业部和纺织工业部的有关人员介绍了化学纤维工业在国际上的发展情形和今后纺织工业部建立化学纤维工业方面的工作规划。目前，安东人造纤维厂正在恢复修建中，预计1957年下半年就可以投入生产。这个厂专门生产人造毛，年产可达四千吨左右。合成纤维中间工厂，也将在1958年投入生产。这个厂将生产短纤维和一部分长丝。另一个长纤维厂，即第一人造纤维厂，将在1959年投入生产，每年可产人造丝一万吨。
    化学纤维的用途很广，人造纤维织品，比棉花和羊毛织出来的产品匀净、美观。用人造丝织出来的渔网，比普通渔网结实。一个用棉纱做帘子布的汽车轮胎，只能行走二万五千公里，而用人造丝做帘子布的汽车轮胎，就能走五万到十万公里。过去，我国需用的人造纤维都是依靠进口货，在我们的人造纤维厂建成以后，将可节省一笔外汇。
    会议特别强调化学纤维研究工作的重要性，尤其在原料的来源上，必须配合国内资源情况，寻找各种可以利用的天然纤维素原料。
