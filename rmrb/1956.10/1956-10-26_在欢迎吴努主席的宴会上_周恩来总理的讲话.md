Speech by Premier Zhou Enlai at the Banquet Welcoming Chairman U Nu

Respected Chairman U Nu, Ladies and Gentlemen, Comrades:

Tonight, we are very pleased to welcome our old friend of the Chinese people, Chairman U Nu of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, his wife, and other Burmese friends to visit China.

Confucius said: "Is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant quarters?" At this moment, we are even more excited about the presence of His Excellency U Nu than this famous saying suggests. We are pleased, firstly, because Your Excellency comes from our kinship-like neighbor, Burma. The friendship between our two peoples not only has a long tradition of many centuries but is also built on the foundation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We are also pleased because the close friendly and cooperative relationship that our two countries now enjoy is inseparable from Your Excellency's efforts. In June 1954, we first met in Rangoon. As a result of this meeting, a joint statement was issued, which established the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the guiding principles for relations between the two countries. After that, Your Excellency visited China on behalf of the Burmese government. On the eve of your departure from Beijing, the Chinese people were pleased to hear you declare that the very solid foundation of friendship between China and Burma had been well and truly laid. Last spring, we each represented our respective governments at the Bandung Conference, working closely together to promote world peace and Afro-Asian solidarity, which further deepened the friendship and understanding between us.

Now we are pleased to see that the Burmese government, under the leadership of Prime Minister U Ba Swe, is continuing, together with the Chinese government, to advance along the road of Sino-Burmese friendship that Your Excellency has contributed greatly to paving. Our two countries are constantly expanding cooperation and exchanges in international affairs, economics, and culture. The growing friendly relations between us powerfully demonstrate that countries, despite different social systems, can fully coexist peacefully as long as they adhere to the Five Principles, and there is no issue between them that cannot be resolved smoothly through friendly consultation. We believe that this flower of friendship, grown in the soil of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, should be cherished and nurtured by the politicians of both countries, so that it can withstand all kinds of weather and bloom for a long time.

This time, Your Excellency U Nu's visit will enable us to take this opportunity to exchange views in a friendly, sincere, and unconstrained manner on the issues of maintaining peace and the common concerns of China and Burma. I fully agree with what Your Excellency U Nu said, that if we have different opinions on issues concerning our two countries, we do not foresee any difficulty in reaching understanding and agreement, because our common starting point is the spirit of the Five Principles that we adhere to. Therefore, I believe that such an exchange of views will always be beneficial to further strengthening the understanding and friendship between our two countries.

China and Burma are kinship countries. We hope that Your Excellency's family and other friends will feel free to look around, see whatever you want to see, and talk to whomever you want to talk to. This is Your Excellency's third visit to China, and you are very familiar with the changes and developments in China. We also sincerely hope that you will give us more guidance on our work in various aspects as an old friend.

I propose a toast to the health of His Excellency U Nu and his wife and other Burmese friends, and to the further development of friendly cooperation between China and Burma!

    在欢迎吴努主席的宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话敬爱的吴努主席阁下，女士们，先生们，同志们：
    今天晚上我们以十分高兴的心情，欢迎中国人民的老朋友、缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努和他的夫人以及其他的缅甸朋友们来中国访问。
    孔子说过：“有朋自远方来，不亦乐乎”。此刻，我们对吴努阁下的光临怀抱着比这句名言更为兴奋的心情。我们感到高兴，首先因为阁下是来自我们的亲戚般的邻邦缅甸，我们两国人民之间的友情不仅具有多少世纪的悠久传统，而且是建筑在和平共处的五项原则的基础之上的。我们感到高兴，还因为我们两国能有现在这样密切的友好合作关系是同阁下的努力分不开的。1954年6月我们在仰光初次会面，这次会谈的结果，发表了联合声明，确定以和平共处的五项原则作为指导两国关系的原则。在这之后阁下又代表缅甸政府访问了中国。在你离开北京的前夕，中国人民以欣慰的心情听到你宣告：中缅两国友谊的非常坚实的基础已经很好和真正地奠定了。去年春天，我们又各自代表本国政府出席万隆会议，为促进世界和平和亚非团结而密切合作，这又进一步加深了我们之间的友谊和谅解。
    现在我们高兴地看到，缅甸政府在吴巴瑞总理的领导之下，正同中国政府一起继续沿着这条有阁下出过大力铺成的中缅友好的道路上前进。我们两国在国际事务、经济、文化各方面的合作和交流正不断在开展。我们之间日益发展的友好关系有力地说明了：国与国之间，尽管社会制度不同，只要信守五项原则，是完全可以和平共处得很好的，彼此之间也没有任何问题不可以通过友好协商的途径顺利解决。我们认为，这朵在和平共处五项原则的土壤中生长出来的友好之花，今后应该得到两国政治家的爱护和培养，使它经得起一切风霜，长久地盛开下去。
    这一次，吴努阁下的来访将能使我们利用这个机会就维护和平和中缅两国共同关心的问题友好、真诚而无拘束地交换意见。我完全同意吴努阁下所说的，假使我们在有关我们两国的问题上有不同意见的话，我们也不会预见到达成了解和协议的困难，因为我们共同的出发点是我们遵守的五项原则精神。因此，我相信我们这样的交换意见，对于进一步加强我们两国间的了解和友好总是有好处的。
    中缅两国是亲戚的国家，我们希望阁下全家以及其他的朋友们，毫不拘束地到处看看，愿意看什么就看什么，愿意同谁谈心就同谁谈心。阁下到中国这是第三次了，对中国的变化和发展情况很熟悉，我们还真诚地希望你以老朋友的资格对我们各方面的工作多加指教。
    我提议为吴努阁下和夫人以及其他缅甸朋友们的健康，为中缅友好合作的进一步发展，干杯！
