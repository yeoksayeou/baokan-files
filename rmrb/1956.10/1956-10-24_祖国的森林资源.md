The Motherland's Forest Resources

	Inner Mongolia's Greater Khingan Range
	Forest Survey Completed Ahead of Schedule

	The Forest Survey First and Second Detachments of the Forest Survey and Design Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry completed the survey of the primeval forests of the Greater Khingan Range in Inner Mongolia ahead of schedule.

	More than 1,000 surveyors from these two detachments climbed over high mountains and cliffs, walked through dense forests where people could not be seen even four or five feet away, and waded through many rivers and swamps to complete the survey of approximately seven million hectares of primeval forest. In order to understand the forest resources of the Greater Khingan Range in detail, under the guidance of Soviet experts, they carefully investigated trees with high economic value in the Greater Khingan Range, such as Korean pine and larch, providing valuable data for the motherland.

	Tanggong Area, Tibet
	A Large Forest Area Discovered

	The Forest Reconnaissance Group of the Ministry of Forestry discovered another large forest area in the Tanggong area of the middle and lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet. After on-site reconnaissance, it was proved that the forest resource reserves here are even richer than the forest reserves in the famous Bomi area of Tibet. Most of the forests are distributed on both sides of the Baka, Bayibu, and Neiyibu rivers south of the Yarlung Tsangpo River. There are many types of trees, generally 35 to 40 centimeters in diameter and an average height of about 35 meters. Logging and transportation here are relatively convenient.

	Nanping County, Fujian Province
	Has Fir Forests with Very High Reserves

	The survey team of the Ministry of Forestry recently discovered a fir forest with a very high reserve in Xihou Township, Nanping County, Fujian Province, with a reserve of 1,206 cubic meters per hectare. Experts believe that the climate, rainfall, and temperature here are suitable for the growth of fir.

	In order to further study the growth of fir forests in Fujian, the Ministry of Forestry has established standard fir forest land in this township and Xinkou, Sanming County, for observation and experimentation. (All Xinhua News Agency dispatches)

    祖国的森林资源
    内蒙古境内大兴安岭
    森林调查提前完成
    林业部调查设计局森林调查第一、二大队，提前完成了内蒙古境内大兴安岭原始森林的调查工作。
    这两个大队的一千多名调查队员爬越过高山、悬崖，走过四五尺远就看不见人的密林，趟过许多河流和沼泽，完成了约七百多万公顷面积的原始森林调查。为了详细了解大兴安岭森林资源，他们在苏联专家指导下，详细考查了大兴安岭经济价值较高的樟子松、落叶松等树木，为祖国提供了宝贵的资料。
    西藏塔工地区
    发现一个大森林区
    林业部森林踏勘组又在西藏雅鲁藏布江中、下游的塔工地区发现一个大森林区。经过实地踏勘，证明这里的森林资源蕴藏量比西藏著名的波密地区森林蕴藏量还要丰富。森林大部分布在雅鲁藏布江南的巴卡、巴衣布和内衣布等河流两岸，树木种类很多，直径一般有三十五至四十公分，平均高度在三十五公尺左右。这里的森林采伐和外运都较方便。
    福建省南平县
    有蓄积量很高的杉木林
    林业部调查队最近在福建南平县溪后乡发现一片蓄积量很高的杉木林，每公顷蓄积量一千二百零六立方公尺。专家们认为，这里的气候、雨水、温度适宜于杉木生长。
    为了进一步研究福建杉木林的生长情况，林业部已在这个乡和三明县莘口设立标准的杉木林地，进行观察和试验。　（均新华社讯）
