How Can a Calf and a Hen Be the Same Price?
Chang Ren

When Li Niansheng, a member of the Dajiang Agricultural Cooperative in Chukou Township, Zixing County, Hunan Province, contributed his calf to the cooperative as an investment, the cooperative only valued it at two yuan. He angrily said, "I don't want this calf. Even a hen is worth two yuan."

In the recent large-scale movement to merge and upgrade cooperatives in various parts of Hunan Province, this phenomenon is widespread. In the Baitao Agricultural Cooperative in Yuanling County, five calves were valued at only two to three yuan each. Not only calves, but also the valuation of adult cattle is also too low. When the Jiqiang Elementary Cooperative in Qiaojiang Township, Xupu County, was established this spring, the valuation of draft cattle was very unreasonable. In this merger and upgrade, cooperative cadres still used this unreasonable price as the standard for valuing other draft cattle.

Why do cooperative cadres want to lower the price of draft cattle in this way? It turns out that there is an idea that dominates them. Many people believe that now that even land is contributed to the cooperative without compensation, draft cattle, forests, farm tools, etc. should also be the same. However, the government stipulates that these things should be valued when they are contributed to the cooperative, so they try to keep the price as low as possible.

If the valuation of draft cattle is too low, cattle owners will certainly be dissatisfied. Although most people do not express strong opinions on the surface, they have a knot in their hearts. How can their production enthusiasm be high?

Now Hunan Province has basically achieved advanced cooperativization, and the Party committees in many areas have checked out these problems in key cooperatives and corrected them. But in some places, this is still an urgent problem to be solved.

    小牛和母鸡怎能同价
    长任
    湖南省资兴县滁口乡大江农业社社员李年生有一条小牛折价入社的时候，社里只评给两块钱。他气愤地说：“这头小牛不要了，就是一只母鸡也要值两块钱。”
    在最近湖南省各地大规模进行并社升级运动中，这种现象普遍存在。沅陵县白桃农业社有五头小牛，每头只折价二元至三元。不仅小牛如此，对大牛的折价，也是偏低的。漵浦县桥江乡积强初级社在今春建社时，耕牛折价就很不合理。在这次并社升级中，社干部仍把这不合理的价格，做为其他耕牛折价的标准。
    为什么社干部们要这样压低耕牛的价格呢？原来有一种思想在支配着他们。很多人认为，现在连土地也无偿入社了，耕牛、山林、农具等也都应该如此。但是政府规定这些东西入社要折价，他们就想法把价钱压得低一些。
    耕牛折价偏低，有牛户当然不满意。大多数人表面上虽然没有提出激烈的意见，心里却结下一个疙瘩，这样他的生产情绪怎么能高呢？
    现在湖南省已经基本上实现了高级合作化，不少地区的党委已在重点社中检查出这些问题，并加以纠正了。但在有些地方，这还是一个急待解决的问题。
