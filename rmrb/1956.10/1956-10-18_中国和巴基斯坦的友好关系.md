    The Friendly Relationship Between China and Pakistan
    Chen Hansheng

    Although Pakistan is a new country, it has a highly developed culture in ancient times. Six hundred miles north of its capital, Karachi, lies an ancient city excavated thirty-four years ago. This ancient city is called Mohenjo-daro. Archaeologists generally recognize it as representing the urban culture of the Indus Valley from 2500 BC to 1500 BC. In the past thirty years, no less than sixty ancient cities have been continuously excavated in the Indus Valley. It has been proven that the area of ​​spread of this ancient culture is even wider than the Nile Valley culture or the Tigris and Euphrates Valley cultures.

    As early as the beginning of the fifth century AD, there was contact between the Chinese and Pakistani people. At that time, the Chinese monk Faxian and his classmates Huijing, Huida, Daozheng, and Baoyun traveled to the ancient countries of Gandhara, Taxila, Purushapura, Rohi, Banna, and Bida, which are now within Pakistan. These ancient countries were all in the Indus Valley. About fifty years later, the Chinese monk Daorong also entered the western Punjab from the southern route of the Tianshan Mountains, that is, the then Gandhara, which was Gandhara. In the first half of the sixth century, Song Yun and Huisheng visited its king here. Song Yun crossed the Indus River and traveled west for thirteen days to Foshafu, which is Purushapura, now Peshawar City in the Northwest Frontier Province of West Pakistan. According to his records, this is a very beautiful and wealthy place. "The rivers and plains are fertile, the city walls are upright, the residents are rich, and the forests and springs are lush. The land is rich in treasures, and the customs are simple and kind." (Yang Xuanzhi's "Records of the Buddhist Temples of Luoyang", Volume 5)

    The earliest monk to come to China from western Punjab to assist in translating Buddhist scriptures was Jnanagupta. He arrived in Nianbo County, Gansu in 552 AD, entered Chang'an eight years later, and moved to Luoyang twenty-five years later. By the time he died at the age of seventy-eight, he had translated a total of thirty-seven Buddhist scriptures, one hundred and seventy-six volumes. His spirit of not being afraid to travel across mountains and rivers and overcome all difficulties is the same as that of Faxian and Xuanzang in our country.

    Everyone knows that Xuanzang stayed in India for a long time and had a close relationship with King Harsha. On his way back and forth between China and India, he traveled around the northern part of what is now West Pakistan. Before seeing King Harsha, he visited the cities of Taxila and Rawalpindi. After bidding farewell to King Harsha, he returned home loaded with one hundred and fifty relics of the Buddha, countless gold, silver, and sandalwood statues of the Buddha, and six hundred and twenty-seven Buddhist scriptures. King Harsha sent people to escort him to Jalandhar in eastern Punjab. In 644 AD, after arriving at this border, the authorities of western Punjab sent people to escort him to Khotan. This is a precedent for international friendly cooperation.

    In the first half of the eighth century AD, Huichao also went to what is now West Pakistan to seek scriptures and study Buddhism. By the ninth century, most of the Indus Valley was ruled by Muslims. The relationship between China and Pakistan gradually shifted from religion to art. Originally, the paintings of various Islamic countries belonged to the Persian type, and the Persian script and paintings were similar, just like Chinese calligraphy and painting. In the thirteenth century, the cultures of China and various Islamic countries began to exchange. At that time, hundreds of Chinese painters and craftsmen went to Persia to participate in the construction of new cities. The method of using lines in Chinese painting was therefore introduced to Persia, strengthening the line component of Persian painting, making Persian painting pay equal attention to lines and colors. Later, although Indian paintings during the Mughal Dynasty focused on color, they still could not get rid of the influence of Chinese lines. Even today, the works of Pakistani painter Chughtai still contain some flavors of Chinese painting.

    The famous Islamic scholar Rashid al-Din compiled a "Compendium of History" in the fourteenth century and invited two Chinese to assist. The two brought many books and materials, which contributed to the illustrations of this book. Part of the original manuscript is now in the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, and another part is in the Royal Asiatic Society in the United Kingdom. The completion of this book is also a good story of international friendly cooperation.

    The expansion of the power of Western European colonialist countries to the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean gradually separated China and South Asian countries. In the past hundred years, many countries have suffered from colonialism's enslavement and oppression. These countries have successively strived for independence. Everyone has suffered similar hardships, and mutual understanding and sympathy have become deeper. After the Asian-African Conference was held in Bandung last year, Asian and African countries have further united. The friendly relations between China and Pakistan have naturally developed further.

    The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Pakistan began in the spring of 1951. In the autumn of that year, the Pakistan-China Friendship Association was established. News figures Mian Iftikharuddin and Ibrahim Jalees came to Beijing to participate in our National Day celebrations. In 1952, China participated in the Pakistan International Industrial Exhibition held in Karachi. In 1953, the Pakistan-China Friendship Association held a Chinese art exhibition. In the autumn of the same year, the Karachi Democratic Students Union, the All Pakistan Democratic Students Union, and the Pakistan Students Union in London sent representatives to participate in our National Day celebrations. In the autumn of 1954, Mrs. Shah Nawaz, Executive Committee Member of the Islamic League, led a seven-member Pakistani women's delegation to participate in the National Day celebrations.

    Trade between our two countries has also gradually developed. The Sino-Pakistan trade agreement and purchase contract signed in March 1953 stipulated that Pakistan would export cotton to China, and China would export coal to Pakistan. At that time, Pakistani cotton was dumped and overstocked due to price cuts by imperialists. China's purchase of cotton from Pakistan once stabilized the price of Pakistani cotton. In the past few years, China's purchase of Pakistani cotton has ranked second only to Japan. In May of this year, China and Pakistan signed another trade contract stipulating that within one year, Pakistan would import 300,000 tons of coal from China. In July, the two governments signed a contract on China's supply of 60,000 metric tons of rice to Pakistan at fair and reasonable prices, and agreed that the Pakistani side would pay in Pakistani rupees. The development of Sino-Pakistan trade is beneficial to the economic construction of both countries.

    The friendly relations between our two countries have continued to progress recently. In January last year, China was invited to send a representative to Karachi to attend the 7th Congress of the All Pakistan Association for the Advancement of Science. In March, the Cultural Center of West Pakistan, Lahore, held a Chinese art exhibition. In August, the Pakistan Arts Council hosted a Chinese arts and crafts exhibition in Karachi. At that time, the Chinese Islamic Pilgrimage Delegation led by Vice Chairman of the Islamic Association of China, Da Puchen, stayed in Pakistan for a two-week visit on its way back home from Mecca. In September, China participated in the Pakistan International Industrial Exhibition again. Nearly one million people visited the Chinese Pavilion within a month. Last year and this year, delegations from Pakistani trade unions came to Beijing to participate in the May Day celebrations one after another. At the invitation of the All Pakistan Women's Association, a Chinese women's delegation visited West Pakistan and East Pakistan for three weeks in November last year. In January of this year, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, Soong Ching Ling, also visited West Pakistan and East Pakistan one after another at the invitation of the Pakistani government and the Prime Minister. When the Islamic Republic of Pakistan was established, Vice Premier He Long of China went to congratulate on behalf of the Chinese government, expressing the friendly feelings of the Chinese people towards the Pakistani people. Not long ago, the Islamic Association of China invited a Pakistani Islamic delegation to participate in Eid al-Fitr. When they arrived in Guangzhou, they performed the Eid prayers at the Huaisheng Guangta Mosque, which has a history of more than 1,300 years.

    Recently, Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy said after the establishment of his new government that Pakistan eagerly hopes to maintain friendly relations with all countries and will seek the cooperation of all countries. We are gratified by this expression of Prime Minister Suhrawardy. We believe that this visit of Prime Minister Suhrawardy to our country will undoubtedly promote the further development of friendly relations between China and Pakistan.

    中国和巴基斯坦的友好关系
    陈翰笙
    巴基斯坦虽然是一个新的国家，但它在古代就有高度发展的文化。在它的首都喀喇蚩以北六百里地方，有三十四年前发掘出来的一个古城。这个古城名莫亨若达罗。考古学家公认它代表了公元前二千五百年至一千五百年期间印度河流域的城市文化。近三十年来在印度河流域继续发掘出来的古城不下六十个。已经证明这个古代文化传播的面积比尼罗河流域文化或底格里斯、幼发拉底两河流域文化更为广大。
    远在公元五世纪初年，中巴人民已有接触。当时我国僧人法显和他的同学慧景、慧达、道整、宝云等人周游现在巴基斯坦境内的犍陁卫国、竺刹尸罗国、弗楼沙国、罗夷国、跋那国和毗荼国。这些古国都在印度河流域。约五十年后我国僧人道荣也由天山南路入旁遮普西部，即当时所称干陀罗国，就是犍陁卫国。六世纪上半叶宋云和惠生曾到此拜见其国王。宋云渡过辛头河而西行十三日，到了佛沙伏即弗楼沙国，就是现在西巴省西北的白沙瓦城。据他所记，这是一个很美丽而富庶的地方。“川原沃壤，城郭端直；民户殷多，林泉茂盛。土饶珍宝，风俗淳善。”（杨炫之的“洛阳伽蓝记”卷五）
    从旁遮普西部到我国来协助翻译佛经的僧人以闍那崛多为最早。他在公元552年抵甘肃碾伯县，八年后入长安，再隔二十五年转赴洛阳。直到他七十八岁逝世时共译了佛经三十七部，一百七十六卷。他那种不怕跋涉山川，克服一切险阻的精神，是和我国法显、玄奘等一样的。
    玄奘在印度很久，他和戒日王有交情，大家都知道。他在往返于中印的道上曾周游现在西巴的北部。他在没有见到戒日王以前，曾游历塔克赛拉和拉瓦尔品第等城。向戒日王告别以后，他就满载一百五十件佛的遗物，无数的金、银、檀香木的佛像，和六百二十七部佛经返国。戒日王派人护送他至旁遮普东部闍兰达罗地方。公元644年到了这边境后，就由旁遮普西部的当局派人护送至于阗。这是国际友好合作的一个先例。
    公元八世纪上半叶慧超还到过现在的西巴地方取经学佛。到了九世纪，印度河流域大部分已为伊斯兰教人所统治。中巴两地关系逐渐由宗教而转向美术方面。原来伊斯兰教各国的绘画都属波斯类型，而波斯的字体与图画相近，一如我国的书法与绘画。十三世纪时代，中国和伊斯兰教各国的文化就交流起来。那时曾有成百的中国画家和手工艺者到波斯一带参加建筑新都会。中国画中用线条的方法因此就传到波斯，加强了波斯画的线条成分，使波斯画对线条和彩色同受到重视。后来莫卧儿王朝时代的印度绘画虽偏重彩色，但仍脱不了中国线条的影响，至今巴基斯坦画家朱格泰的作品还含有一些中国画的风味。
    伊斯兰教著名学者拉希迪乌廷在十四世纪时代曾编了一部“历史纲要”，曾邀请两位中国人去协助。这两位带去很多书籍和资料，对这部书的插画有所贡献。原稿现在一部分存在苏格兰的爱丁堡大学，另一部分存在英国皇家亚洲学会。这部书的编成也是国际友好合作的一段佳话。
    西欧殖民主义国家的势力伸张到印度洋和太平洋后，使我国和南亚各国渐渐隔阂了。近百年来许多国家受着殖民主义的奴役和压迫。这些国家已接二连三地争取了独立。大家遭受过相似的苦难，彼此间的了解和同情就更加深刻。去年在万隆召开亚非会议后，亚非国家有了进一步的团结。中巴两国间友好关系也自然地有了进一步的发展。
    中巴建交始于1951年春。那年秋季巴中友好协会就成立了。新闻界闻人米安·伊夫提卡鲁丁和易布拉欣·杰利斯曾来北京参加我国庆观礼。1952年我国参加了在喀喇蚩举行的巴基斯坦国际工业博览会。1953年巴中友协曾举办了中国艺术品展览会。同年秋，喀喇蚩民主学生联合会、全巴民主学生联合会和在伦敦的巴基斯坦学生联合会都派代表来参加我国庆观礼。1954年秋，伊斯兰教联盟执行委员沙·纳瓦兹夫人带领七人组成的巴妇女代表团来参加了国庆观礼。
    我们两国的贸易也逐渐开展。1953年3月签订的中巴贸易协定和购货合同，规定了巴基斯坦对我国输出棉花，我国对巴基斯坦输出煤。那时巴棉遭帝国主义者压价而滞销。我国向巴基斯坦购买棉花，一度稳定了巴棉的价格。几年来，我国采购巴棉仅次于日本而居于第二位。今年5月，中巴两国又签订了一个贸易合同，规定在一年以内，巴基斯坦要输入我国的三十万吨煤。7月，两国政府又签订了关于我国以公平合理价格供应巴基斯坦六万公吨大米的合同，并同意巴方用巴基斯坦卢比支付。中、巴贸易的发展，对于两国经济建设都有好处。
    我们两国的友好关系最近继续进展。去年1月我国应邀而派代表赴喀喇蚩，出席全巴科学促进会第七届会议。3月西巴省文化中心拉合尔举办了中国艺术展览会。8月巴基斯坦艺术协会在喀喇蚩主办了中国工艺美术展览会。那时我国伊斯兰教协会达浦生副主席所带领的中国伊斯兰教朝圣团，在由麦加返国途中留巴作两星期访问。9月我国又参加了巴基斯坦国际工业博览会，一个月内参观中国展览馆的人近一百万。去年和今年巴基斯坦工会代表团曾相继来北京参加五一节观礼。我国妇女代表团应全巴妇女协会的邀请，于去年11月在西巴和东巴作三星期访问。今年1月，我人民代表大会常委会宋庆龄副委员长应巴基斯坦政府和总理的邀请，也先后访问了西巴和东巴。巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国成立的时候，我国贺龙副总理代表我国政府前往祝贺，表达了我国人民对巴基斯坦人民的友好感情。不久以前，中国伊斯兰教协会邀请了巴基斯坦伊斯兰教代表团来参加开斋节。他们到了广州，就在有一千三百多年历史的怀圣光塔寺做了斋日的礼拜。
    最近，巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底在他的新政府成立以后说：巴基斯坦热切希望同一切国家保持友好关系，并将寻求一切国家的合作。我们对于苏拉瓦底总理的这种表示感到欣慰。我们相信，这一次苏拉瓦底总理来我国访问，无疑地将使中巴两国的友好关系进一步向前发展。
