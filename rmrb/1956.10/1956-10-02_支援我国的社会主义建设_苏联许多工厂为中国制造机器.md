Xinhua News Agency, 30th. According to TASS reports: Many factories all over the Soviet Union are manufacturing machines and industrial equipment for China to support China’s socialist construction.

    Leningrad factories are currently manufacturing hundreds of various machines and equipment for China. The machine-building workers at the Izhor Plant will soon manufacture the second 5,000-ton hydraulic press for China this year. A giant jaw crusher, manufactured by the Hardware Factory for Chinese miners, capable of crushing 500 tons of ore per hour, is about to be shipped. The staff and workers of the Kirov Lifting and Transport Equipment Factory have already manufactured and shipped four electric overhead traveling cranes to Chinese chemical industrial enterprises. The "Hardware Worker" factory has manufactured a new hydraulic autoclave for vulcanizing rubber products for China.

    Machine-building workers in the Urals are manufacturing high-efficiency machines for many newly built industrial enterprises in China. This year alone, they have shipped forty-seven powerful oil drilling rigs, twenty-nine "Ural-style" excavators, one agricultural soil improvement machine, and one lime calcination kiln to China. Recently, this factory shipped a "20800" heavy plate rolling mill to China, and the equipment for transporting this giant machine required fourteen trains. Now, it is installing an ingot crane for use on rolling mills at the Anshan Iron and Steel Complex.

    In Baku, the capital of the Azerbaijan Republic, many factories of the "Azerbaijan Oil Machinery" Trust are now manufacturing oil industrial equipment for China. The Sardarov Factory is installing drilling derricks, the Kirov Factory and the "Bolshevik" Factory are manufacturing drill pipe joints and drill bits, and the "Lieutenant Schmidt" Factory is manufacturing fuel injector steel bars and other equipment for China. In addition, Baku workers are also manufacturing powerful flushing units, mobile drilling rigs, tractor-towed cranes for repairing oil wells, and complete sets of machinery for lifting and lowering drilling rigs, as well as other state-of-the-art oil industrial machinery for China.
