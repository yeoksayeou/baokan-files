    A Delicate and Exquisite Handicraft Art Piece
    Wang Yinan
    The semi-relief ivory carving of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is currently being crafted by Chen Botao, an outstanding carving artist from Wuhan. The entire carving project is estimated to require three and a half months of workdays to complete, and two-thirds of the work has already been finished.
    This is a delicate and exquisite work of art. On an ivory carving board that is 26.5 centimeters long, 7.5 centimeters high, and 0.5 centimeters thick, a semi-relief of the entire bridge and the scenery of the three towns of Wuhan is carved. The view is taken from Snake Mountain in Wuchang, overlooking the bridge, Wuchang, Hanyang, and Hankou to the northeast. In the carving, we will see the bridge spanning the Yangtze River, with eight piers and ten spans, two levels, and on the lower level, two trains going in opposite directions, spewing thick smoke, passing through the bridge from the Wuchang bridgehead. On the upper level, the road and pedestrian walkway have six parallel cars, driving from Wuchang on the south bank towards Hanyang, and more than twenty other cars and five hundred pedestrians, traveling back and forth on the bridge. At the left and right of the north and south ends of the bridge, there are two bridgehead towers each; under the Wuchang bridgehead, the Kongming Lantern historical site still stands tall. On both sides of the upper-level road, there are exquisite bridge poles, with three-sphere lighting columns, arranged on the left and right, making the bridge look extremely magnificent.
    Under the bridge, the Yangtze River is mighty, with surging waves, and there are eleven ships coming and going, including Yangtze River steamers, ferries, and wooden boats, as well as six barges in a row and two pusher barges, sailing in the river.
    On the east side of the bridge's south side, in Wuchang, along the riverside road, there are ferry terminals, roadside flowerbeds, and more than twenty cars traveling back and forth, as well as over a hundred pedestrians.
    From Wuchang, one can remotely see the distant view of Tortoise Mountain in Hanyang on the north bank, where the sea meets the sky. From the riverside road in Hanyang, crossing the Han River eastward, the street scene of the Hankou riverside avenue is vividly visible. From the Siguan Dian Ferry Terminal, going all the way down, the more prominent buildings, such as the Chonghua District Workers' Dormitory, the Seamen's Club, the waiting room of the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau, the Wuhan Customs House, and the auditorium of the Yiyuan Road People's Committee, are all clearly distinguishable.
    The entire carving is delicate and exquisite, with some places so detailed that they are as fine as a hair, requiring a magnifying glass of dozens of times to see clearly.
    Chen Botao is currently forty-two years old and has twenty-nine years of carving experience. He once carved the document of the 25,000-li Long March on an ivory board that was 1.7 inches long and 0.9 inches wide, with a total of 10,864 characters. He also carved the full text of Su Dongpo's First and Second Chibi Rhapsodies on one side of an ivory seal that was three inches long and six minutes wide, with characters that could only be seen clearly under a 30-40x magnifying glass. When the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition was held in Wuhan, he also carved a three-dimensional perspective view of the exterior of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Palace on a square-inch piece of ivory; and he carved a public bus on a grain-sized piece of ivory, with twenty-six passengers and a driver, and under a magnifying glass, there were two headlights on the front of the car, and the license plate number was clearly distinguishable.
    Since liberation, he has created many excellent works. He is now preparing to organize an ivory carving art cooperative, to cultivate new forces, to better serve the people, and to express the unique style of Wuhan ivory carving, focusing on exquisite and delicate carvings.

    一件精巧细致的手工艺术品
    王逸南
    武汉长江大桥的半立体象牙雕刻，现正由武汉市优秀雕刻艺人陈波涛刻制中，全部雕刻工程，预计须三个半月的工作日可以完成，现已完成了五分之三的工作量。
    这是一件精巧细致的艺术品。在一块长二十六公分半，高七公分半，厚半公分的象牙雕板上，雕刻了半立体的大桥全景和武汉三镇的景况。取景是登武昌蛇山，向东北俯瞰大桥、武昌、汉阳及汉口。在雕刻中，我们将看到大桥横贯大江，有八墩十孔，上下两层，下层火车道上，有上下行火车两列，喷出滚滚浓烟，自武昌桥头相对穿桥而过。上层汽车道及人行道上，有平行汽车六辆，自南岸武昌向汉阳行驶，另有汽车二十余辆，行人五百余人，来往于桥上。大桥南北两端的左右，各有桥头楼堡两座；在武昌桥头下，孔明灯古迹，依然耸立。上层汽车道两旁，有精致的桥杆，三球型的照明灯柱，排列左右，桥容极为壮观。
    桥下大江浩荡，波涛汹涌，来往的船只有长江大轮、轮渡及木船等十一艘，一列式的拖船六艘，顶推式的二艘，航行于江中。
    桥南东边武昌的沿江马路，有轮渡码头，马路花坛，和来往行驶的汽车二十余辆，行人百余人。
    由武昌遥望北岸汉阳的龟山远景，海天相接。由汉阳沿江马路向东跨过汉水，汉口沿江大道的街市景况，历历在目，自四官殿轮渡码头一路下行，比较突出的建筑物，如崇化区工人宿舍、海员俱乐部、长江航运局候船室、武汉关、一元路人民委员会大礼堂等，皆历历可辨。
    全部雕刻，精巧细致，有些地方细致到毫如微发，须用几十倍的放大镜才能看得清楚。
    陈波涛现年四十二岁，具有二十九年雕刻经验。他曾在一寸七分长九分宽的象牙板上，刻过二万五千里长征的文件，共有一万零八百六十四字。又在三寸长六分宽的象牙图章的一面，刻了苏东坡前后赤壁赋全文，在三十至四十倍的放大镜下，才能看着清晰的字迹。苏联经济文化建设成就展览会在武汉展出时，他又在方吋大小的象牙上，雕刻了中苏友好宫的立体透视外景一个；又在米粒大小的象牙上雕刻了一辆公共汽车，坐有二十六个乘客和一个司机，在放大镜下面看，车头还有车灯二盏，车牌号码，清晰可辨。
    解放以后，他创造了不少的优秀作品。现正着手组织象牙雕刻工艺社，培养新生力量，更好地为人民服务，并以精致细巧的雕刻为主，表现着武汉象牙雕刻的独特风格。
