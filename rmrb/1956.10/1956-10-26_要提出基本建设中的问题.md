    Raise Questions in Basic Construction

    Newspapers frequently report on the progress and achievements of various basic construction projects, greatly encouraging readers. However, there are also many shortcomings and errors in basic construction. Everyone has seen "The Wasteful Construction Site" on the screen and found it very educational. It is hoped that newspapers can also frequently raise questions in basic construction and report on the lessons learned in basic construction, so as to facilitate relevant departments to improve their work.

    要提出基本建设中的问题
    报纸上经常报道各项基本建设的进展和成就，给予读者很大鼓舞。但是基本建设中也有许多缺点和错误。大家在银幕上看到过“浪费的工地”，觉得很有教育意义。希望报纸也能经常提出基本建设中的问题，报道基本建设中的教训，以利予有关部门改进工作。
