Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, Electric dispatch by Xinhua News Agency reporters Wang Dewen and Huang Jing: The Linxia Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Gansu Province, after conducting on-the-spot investigations in six counties recently, proposed the issue of not neglecting technical guidance in rural sideline production.

The sideline occupations operated by agricultural production cooperatives in the Linxia area amount to more than two hundred kinds. Sideline occupations such as fish farming, duck raising, rabbit raising, beekeeping, and silkworm raising, which were never operated or rarely operated in the past, have also begun to be operated. There are more than 170 horse, cattle, and sheep farms of a larger scale opened by agricultural cooperatives. According to a survey of five counties, the income from sideline occupations this year increased by 57.5% compared to last year. The active scene of sideline production in the whole region is unprecedented. However, along with it, some technical problems in sideline production have not been resolved, which has affected the smooth development of sideline production and affected the sideline income of cooperatives and individual members. For example, the Tiezhai Agricultural Cooperative in Linxia County opened a dairy farm, but the members did not know how to make butter. The Qinfen Agricultural Cooperative in Linxia City raised more than 100 ducks, but due to a lack of management experience, more than half of them died. Many farmers in Hezheng County have the habit of beekeeping, but the old method of "boiling bees to extract honey" is still used for honey making, which affects the mass reproduction of bees. The Gongbeitan Agricultural Cooperative in Dongxiang Autonomous County built a 100-mu fish pond, but it lost money because of poor management. The "Leghorn chickens," "Italian bees," and "Angora rabbits" introduced from other places have either died or degenerated because they do not understand breeding methods. Some farmers in Kangle County have the technology and experience of making vermicelli from potatoes, but this experience has not been well summarized and disseminated; while in Dongxiang Autonomous County and other places, a large amount of potatoes are left over and cannot be stored. Raising chickens, pigs, and sheep are the main sideline productions of farmers here. After large-scale operation, agricultural cooperatives generally lack methods for preventing and controlling chicken plague, hog cholera, and sheep pox, and the animal husbandry and veterinary stations cannot take care of them, resulting in a large number of deaths.

Some responsible persons of the local party and government leading organs believe that in order to promote the smooth development of sideline production, in addition to better mutual support between agricultural cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives, exchanging experiences, learning from each other's strengths, and jointly solving technical problems, the national agricultural technology departments at all levels should strengthen agricultural technology research and solve more technical problems in sideline production for agricultural cooperatives. The agricultural technology promotion stations in various places should also overcome the shortcomings of only paying attention to technical guidance in improving cultivation techniques, improving agricultural tools, and promoting improved varieties in the past, and not paying attention to sideline technical guidance, actively cultivate technical cadres related to sideline occupations, and summarize and promote advanced experience in various sideline productions. At the same time, they also welcome newspapers and magazines to introduce more of the rich experience and knowledge of operating sideline production across the country.

### 临夏地区注意副业生产的技术指导

　　临夏地区注意副业生产的技术指导
    新华社兰州电　新华社记者王得温、黄静报道：中共甘肃省临夏地方委员会最近在六个县经过实地调查，提出了不能忽视农村副业生产中的技术指导这个问题。
    临夏地区农业生产合作社经营的副业有二百多种，过去从来没有经营或很少经营的养鱼、养鸭、养兔、养蜂、养蚕等副业，也开始经营起来。由农业社开办的规模较大的马、牛、羊场有一百七十多个。据五个县的调查，今年副业的收益比去年增加了57.5％。全区副业生产的活跃景象是空前未有的。但是，随之而来的是一些副业生产中的技术问题得不到解决，以致影响了副业生产的顺利发展，影响了合作社和社员个人的副业收入。如临夏县铁寨农业社开设了一个奶牛场，社员不会制牛油。临夏市勤奋农业社养了一百多只鸭子，由于缺乏经营管理的经验，死了一半多。和政县很多农民有养蜂习惯，但制蜜还是采用“煮蜂取蜜”的老办法，影响到蜜蜂不能大量繁殖。东乡族自治县拱北滩农业社修了一个百亩大的鱼池，因为经营管理不善，结果也赔了本。各地从外地引进的“莱亨鸡”，“意大利蜂”，“安哥拉兔”，因为不懂饲养方法，有的死了，有的蜕化变种。康乐县有些农民有用洋芋制粉条的技术和经验，这些经验没有很好地总结和传播；而东乡族自治县等地洋芋却大量剩余，无法储藏。养鸡，养猪，养羊都是这里农民主要的副业生产。大量经营以后，农业社一般对防治鸡瘟、猪瘟、羊痘都缺少办法，而畜牧兽医工作站又包不下来，结果造成大批死亡。
    当地党政领导机关的一些负责人认为，要促进副业生产的顺利开展，除了农业社和农业社之间更好地互相支援，交流经验，取长补短，共同解决技术问题外，国家各级农业技术部门应加强农业技术研究，为农业社多解决一些副业生产中的技术问题。各地的农业技术推广站也要克服以往只注意在改进耕作技术、改良农具、推广良种等方面的技术指导，而不注意副业技术指导的缺点，积极培养有关副业方面的技术干部，总结推广各种副业生产的先进经验。同时，他们也很欢迎报章杂志多介绍一些全国各地经营副业生产的丰富经验和知识。
