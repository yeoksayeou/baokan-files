People always blame subjectivism when good things are done badly. This is certainly true. But the reason why subjectivism can cause harm is often due to the help of commandism; otherwise, subjectivism would not work.

Turning dry land into paddy fields can indeed increase agricultural production, which is a good thing. The leading cadres of a certain county decided to turn all the dry land in the county into paddy fields by digging more wells. They wanted to do something good. However, this good thing did not work in some places because the geology in this area was not good. If the wells were dug too shallow, the water would be salty and could not be used for irrigation; to get good water, they had to dig thirty yards deep. Using such deep wells to turn dry land into paddy fields, although not as difficult as reaching the sky, is really impossible under the current conditions. After an agricultural production cooperative was assigned to dig twenty such deep brick wells, the cooperative cadres felt that the cooperative currently lacked both financial resources and technical personnel, so how could they complete the task? Moreover, even if they were forced to dig them out, they might not be useful. After discussing for a long time, they still couldn't think of a solution, and finally went to the district cadres to state their reasons, requesting not to dig or to dig fewer brick wells. But the district cadres said angrily: "The task of digging wells is given by the Party, whoever doesn't dig wells is an anti-Party element." "Anti-Party element," that's terrible! The cooperative cadres immediately mobilized all the cooperative members to work day and night to dig wells. The task was completed as scheduled, but the more than 4,000 yuan of funds spent by the cooperative and the huge labor expended by the cooperative members only resulted in twenty "viewing wells" that could be looked at but not used. Is this considered doing a good thing? Or a bad thing? If it weren't for using "anti-Party elements" to intimidate people, I don't think this bad thing could have been done. Also, some people insisted that farmers plant peanuts and sweet potatoes in places that were not suitable for growing peanuts and sweet potatoes. The reason was that peanuts tasted fragrant and sweet potatoes tasted sweet; high yields could increase income. Some people also made farmers plant certain improved varieties in areas that were not suitable for planting these crops. The reason was that the yield was high, the income was high, and it was beneficial to both the farmers and the country. "Two benefits," this is of course a good thing, but unfortunately it is not suitable, so naturally it was opposed by the farmers. However, the people who made this decision were very enthusiastic about the good things they imagined, so they turned a deaf ear to the opinions that it was not suitable to plant, forcibly promoted it, and even formulated several measures, which they called several "revolutions." Those who violated it were called disrupting the "revolution," and some Party members were even expelled from the Party for this reason. Who dares to "sabotage the socialist revolution?" Some agricultural cooperatives had no choice but to silently execute the orders. As a result, the farmers lost fertilizer and seeds, and wasted their efforts; either the production was greatly reduced, or there was no harvest at all. If we look at the results rather than the motives, who has added unfavorable factors to the socialist revolution? I am afraid that those who "did good things" will have a hard time escaping justice at this time.

People who really want to do good things should not try to intimidate people first, but should listen to the opinions of the people, study the actual situation, and consult with everyone. Only those who truly do not put on airs and intimidate people can thoroughly overcome subjectivism.

    不要吓人
    林史
    把好事办坏了，人们总要归罪于主观主义。这当然是不错的。但主观主义之所以能够造成祸害，还是常常由于命令主义的帮忙；否则主观主义就行不通。
    变旱田为水田，确可使农业增产，这是好事。某县的领导干部，决定用多打井的办法，把全县的旱田变为水田。这是想办好事了。但是这件好事却在一些地方行不通。因为这一带地质不好，井打浅了，水咸不能浇地；要出好水，就得挖三十丈深。用打这样深的井来使旱田变水田，虽不难似上青天，在当前条件下却也真是行不通。有一个农业生产合作社被派要打二十眼这样深的砖井以后，社干部们就觉得目前社里既缺乏经济能力，又无技术人材，怎能完成任务呢？而且勉强挖出来也未必用得上。商量了半天，还是想不出办法，最后才去向区干部陈述理由，要求不打或少打砖井。可是区干部却气虎虎地说：“打井的任务是党给的，谁不打井，谁就是反党分子。”“反党分子”，这还了得！社干部们连忙动员全体社员，日夜赶工打井。任务算是如期完成了，不过，社里所付出的四千余元的资金和社员们所耗费的巨大劳动，换来的只不过是能看不能用的二十眼“看井”罢了。这究竟算是办了好事呢？还是办了坏事？假设不是用“反党分子”去吓人，我看这坏事是办不起来的吧。还有，有些人硬要农民在不适宜种花生和红薯的地方，种花生和红薯。理由是花生味香，红薯肉甜；产量高能增加收入。有的人又在不适宜种植某种优良品种的地带让农民种这种作物。理由是产量高，收入多，对农民对国家两有利。“两利”，这当然是好事，但可惜不适宜，自然也就遭到农民们的反对。可是，作这种决定的人们，非常热衷于自己想像中的好事，于是把不适宜种的意见当作耳边风，强制推行，并且还订出几项措施，还称之为几项“革命”。违犯了的就被称作是破坏“革命”，并且真的因此开除了一些党员的党籍。谁敢“破坏社会主义革命”呢，一些农业社只得又哑口无言地去执行命令了。结果是弄得农民赔了肥料、种籽，白搭上工夫；不是大大减产，就是颗粒不收。如果不是从动机而是从结果来看，究竟是谁给社会主义革命增加了不利的因素呢？恐怕“办好事”的人这时就难逃公道了吧。
    真正想办好事的人，应该先不要设法吓人，而是多听听众人的意见，多研究一下实际情况，多和大家商量。只有真正不装腔作势吓人的人，才有可能彻底克服主观主义。
