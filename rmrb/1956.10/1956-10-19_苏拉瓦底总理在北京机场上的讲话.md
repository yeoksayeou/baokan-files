Prime Minister Suhrawardy:
    I am very grateful for your Excellency's warm welcome. I have always longed to visit your country to establish harmonious and friendly contacts, and to personally see the amazing progress made under the wise leadership of His Excellency President Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China.

    We have come to your country this time to bring the greetings and wishes of the people of Pakistan to the people of this great nation. Although many of us are visiting China for the first time, we do not consider ourselves strangers, because we have always been deeply interested in and admired the great changes and developments in your country recently.

    The people of Pakistan have great respect and warm friendship for the people of China. I am very pleased to think that the relationship between our two countries is pleasant and harmonious. I am convinced that these ties of friendship will be further consolidated in the future.

    We Pakistanis believe in democracy, freedom, social justice, and the right to self-determination. Our constitution guarantees the people basic rights such as equality of status, equality of opportunity, equality before the law, freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of belief, and freedom of assembly and association. Our aim is to establish social, economic, and political justice. In international affairs, we are loyal to the cause of peace and goodwill, and our guiding principles are international cooperation and understanding. We sincerely hope that all countries can live in harmony, regardless of their goals and the methods of achieving these goals, without infringing on each other's rights, and cooperate to promote the welfare of mankind. For our own progress and the values cherished by mankind, peace is indispensable. We fervently believe in peace and sincerely hope that disputes between countries can be resolved fairly through agreements or by the international forum of world opinion, so that weak countries can coexist with strong countries and follow their own way of life. As far as we are concerned, we are ready to extend a hand of cooperation to every country in order to jointly carry out this noble work.

    Every country has the right to determine its own destiny and its own way of life. In recognition of these rights, we, along with other Asian and African countries, including your great country, attended the Bandung Conference and were signatories to the declaration embodying the ten principles of world peace and cooperation.

    I thank you again for your warm welcome to me and my entourage. We have high hopes for this stay in your country and are confident that we will return with the happiest memories of this visit.

    Thank you again.

    苏拉瓦底总理在北京机场上的讲话总理阁下：
    我非常感谢阁下的热烈欢迎。我一向渴望访问贵国，来建立融洽的、友好的接触，并且亲自看看在中华人民共和国主席毛泽东先生阁下和总理周恩来先生的英明领导下所取得的惊人进展。
    我们这次到贵国来，是要把巴基斯坦人民的问候和祝愿带给这个伟大国家的人民。虽然我们中间有许多人是初次来到中国，可是我们并不把自己当作生客，因为我们对于贵国最近的伟大变化和发展，一直深感兴趣并且赞美不置。
    巴基斯坦人民对中国人民非常敬重，并且怀着热烈的友情。我很高兴地想到，我们两国间的关系是愉快而融洽的。我深信，这些友谊的联系将来会进一步巩固。
    我们巴基斯坦人相信民主、自由、社会正义以及自决权。我们的宪法保证人民有地位平等、机会平等、在法律面前平等、思想自由、言论自由、信仰和集会结社自由等基本权利。我们的目的是要建立社会、经济和政治的正义。在国际事务方面，我们忠于和平和善意的事业，我们的指针是国际合作和谅解的原则。我们恳切希望所有国家都能够和睦相处，不论它们的目的和达到这些目的的方法怎样，都能够不侵犯彼此的权利，并且协力合作，来促进人类的福利。为了我们自己的进步，和人类所珍惜的价值，和平是不可缺少的。我们热烈相信和平，并且恳切希望国与国之间的争端能够通过协议得到公正的解决，或者由世界舆论的国际讲坛来解决，使得弱国能够跟强国并肩共处，并且遵循它们自己的生活方式。就我们自己而论，我们准备向每一个国家伸出合作之手，以便共同进行这一个崇高的工作。
    每一个国家都有权决定它自己的命运和它自己的生活方式。由于承认这些权力，我们曾经跟亚洲和非洲其他国家，包括你们的伟大国家在内，一道出席万隆会议，并且是那篇体现世界和平和合作的十大原则的宣言的一个签字国。
    我再度感谢阁下对我和我的随行人员的热烈欢迎。我们对于这次在贵国的逗留抱着希望，并且深信我们回去时，将会带着这一次访问的最幸福的记忆。
    我再一次感谢阁下。
