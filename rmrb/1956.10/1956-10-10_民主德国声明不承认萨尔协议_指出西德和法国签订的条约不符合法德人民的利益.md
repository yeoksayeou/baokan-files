Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 9th – According to a report from the German News Agency: The government of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement protesting the West German and French agreement on the Saar issue.

The East German government said in a statement that the Saar treaty to be signed is the result of a deal between West German monopoly capitalists and the French coal and steel industry. It violates the will already expressed by the residents of the Saar, and is also incompatible with the interests of the entire German people and the French people.

The statement pointed out: The Saar is part of Germany, and decisions regarding the fate of the Saar territory are, and will continue to be, a matter for the whole of Germany. Therefore, the East German government cannot recognize the agreement on the Saar that has been reached between the West German government and the French government. Regulations concerning the Saar issue must be agreed upon by the governments of East Germany, West Germany, and the Saar.

The East German government then announced that, pending the establishment of a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany, agreements concerning the Saar territory must ensure: that the Saar is not drawn into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Western European Union, or other military blocs; that no West German or other foreign armed forces, atomic and hydrogen weapons are stationed on Saar territory; that conscription is not implemented in the Saar; that the democratic rights and freedoms of the people of the Saar are guaranteed; that the living standards of the Saar residents are not lowered; and that the Saar can develop free trade and unrestricted cultural exchange with West Germany and East Germany on the basis of a formal agreement.

　　民主德国声明不承认萨尔协议
　　指出西德和法国签订的条约不符合法德人民的利益
    新华社柏林9日电　据德意志通讯社报道：德意志民主共和国政府发表声明，抗议西德和法国关于萨尔问题的协议。
    民主德国政府在声明中说，准备签订的——萨尔条约是西德垄断资本家和法国煤钢工业进行交易的结果。它是违反萨尔居民已经表明的意志的，同时也是同全德国人民以及法国人民的利益不相调和的。
    声明指出：萨尔是德国的一部分，有关萨尔领土的命运的决定现在是、将来也是全德国的事务。因此，民主德国政府不能承认西德政府和法国政府已经达成的关于萨尔的协议。有关萨尔问题的规定必须得到民主德国、西德和萨尔政府的同意。
    民主德国政府接着宣布，在一个统一、和平和民主的德国成立以前，关于萨尔领土的协议必须保证：不把萨尔拉入北大西洋集团、西欧联盟或其他军事集团；不在萨尔领土上驻扎西德和其他国家的武装部队、原子和氢武器；不在萨尔实行征兵；保障萨尔人民的民主权利和自由；不降低萨尔居民的生活水平；使萨尔同西德和民主德国能够在正式协议的基础上发展自由贸易和不受限制的文化交流。
