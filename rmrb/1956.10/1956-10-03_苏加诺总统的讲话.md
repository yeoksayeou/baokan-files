President Sukarno's Speech

Mr. Chairman, Comrades:

    First of all, I would like to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your kind words about me personally and the Indonesian nation.

    Mr. Chairman is too kind in his praise of me. As I said when I arrived at the airport, "Without the people, I am nothing." I am merely the voice of the suffering Indonesian people. Everything I say and propose in my work, my feelings and desires, are in fact the feelings and desires that have existed in the hearts of the Indonesian nation for decades.

    Indeed, a leader who cannot express the wishes of the people is like a general shouting in the desert.

    Mr. Chairman, if I say that there is sympathy and brotherly friendship between the Indonesian people and the Chinese people, then please believe that this truly expresses the inner feelings of the Indonesian people.

    There are objective and subjective factors that promote the brotherly friendship between the Indonesian people and the Chinese people. First, regarding the current objective and subjective factors. Mr. Chairman himself mentioned these objective and subjective factors in his speech just now. These factors require the Indonesian people and the Chinese people to cooperate. Second, there are factors related to the future, aspirations, and ideals. In terms of ideals, aspirations, and the future, the Chinese people and the Indonesian people also have many things in common. Your ideals and our ideals can be said to be the same. Your ideal is to build a new world without exploitation, without suffering, without oppression, where people can live a free and happy life. Our ideal is also the same. Therefore, the current situation requires us to cooperate. In terms of ideals, it can be said that we are the same, and in the past, many objective and subjective factors have made us feel that we must establish a brotherly friendship.

    Chinese friends, the Chinese people, are not new friends to the Indonesian people. We have known each other for hundreds or even thousands of years. But another situation, more than this historical unity, makes us sympathize with each other even more, and that is that the Chinese people and the Indonesian people have suffered together.

    China is now independent, and Indonesia is now independent, but please think about it: how much suffering you have endured and how many sacrifices you have made to achieve this independence; how much suffering the Indonesian nation has endured and how many sacrifices it has made to achieve this independence! You have tasted prison, and we have tasted prison; you have tasted the gallows, and we have tasted the gallows; you have wives who have lost their husbands, and we have wives who have lost their husbands; you have mothers who have lost their sons, and we have mothers who have lost their sons; you have villages that have been burned down, and we have villages that have been burned down; you have suffered for your ideals, and we have suffered for our ideals. Therefore, friends, today's factors bring us together and require us to cooperate; future ideals encourage us to join hands like two comrades-in-arms fighting for a common ideal; the days to come make us sympathize with each other like people who have suffered together.

    The future, today, and the past provide us with conditions for mutual connection, so I repeat once again what I said at the airport a few days ago, my task is to strengthen the friendly relations between the Chinese people and the Indonesian people, and this task is not difficult to achieve.

    After my last sentence is translated into Chinese, Russian, and English, I ask you all to stand up and raise your glasses together:

    To the prosperity of the Chinese people,
    To the brotherly friendship between China and Indonesia,
    To world peace,
    To the realization of the ideal of building a new world,
    To the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, cheers!

### 苏加诺总统的讲话

1956-10-03

专栏：

    苏加诺总统的讲话主席先生阁下，同志们：
    首先，我对主席先生刚才对我个人和印度尼西亚民族所讲的亲切的话表示感谢。
  主席先生过于赞扬我了。正如我刚到机场时所说的那样，“没有人民，我就算不了什么”。我只不过是遭受苦难的印度尼西亚人民的喉舌。我在工作中所讲的和所提出的一切，我的这种感情和愿望实际上也就是几十年来存在于印度尼西亚民族心中的感情和愿望。
    的确，一个领袖要是不能表达人民的心愿，那么，他就像一个在沙漠上大喊大叫的将军。
    主席先生，如果我说印度尼西亚人民同中国人民之间存在着同情和兄弟般的友谊的话，那么，请相信，这确实是表达了印度尼西亚人民内心的感情。
    促进印度尼西亚人民同中国人民的兄弟般的友谊的客观和主观因素本来是存在的。首先是关于现在的客观和主观的因素。主席先生自己刚才在讲话中已经提到这几个客观和主观的因素。这些因素要求印度尼西亚人民和中国人民一定要共同合作。其次是关于前途、愿望和理想的因素。在理想、愿望和前途方面，中国人民同印度尼西亚人民之间也有很多共同点。你们的理想同我们的理想可以说是相同的。你们的理想是要建立一个没有剥削、没有苦难、没有压迫，人民能过着自由、幸福生活的新世界。我们的理想也是这样。因此，现在的情况要求我们一定要共同合作。在理想方面，可以说我们是相同的，而且，过去的日子，以往的年代，又有许多客观和主观的因素使我们不能不感到一定要建立兄弟般的友好关系。
    中国朋友、中国人民对印度尼西亚人民来说不是新朋友。我们已经相识了几百年甚至几千年。但是，另外有种情况比这种历史上的团结更能使我们互相同情，这种情况就是中国人民同印度尼西亚人民曾经共同遭受过苦难。
    中国现在独立了，印度尼西亚现在也独立了，可是，你们请想想看：你们为了争取这种独立遭受过多少苦难，付出了多大的牺牲，我们印度尼西亚民族为了争取这种独立遭受过多少苦难，付出了多大的牺牲！你们尝过监狱的滋味，我们也尝过监狱的滋味；你们尝过绞刑架的滋味，我们也尝过绞刑架的滋味；你们有失去丈夫的妻子，我们也有失去丈夫的妻子；你们有失去儿子的母亲，我们也有失去儿子的母亲；你们有被烧毁的乡村，我们也有被烧毁的乡村；你们为实现自己的理想受过苦难，我们也曾经为实现自己的理想受过苦难。因此，朋友们，今天的因素使我们并要求我们一定要共同合作；未来的理想促使我们像两个为实现共同的理想而斗争的战友一样携起手来；未来的日子，使我们像同患难的人一样互相同情。
    未来，今天和过去给我们提供了相互联系的条件，因此，我再一次重复为前几天我在飞机场上说过的话，我的任务是加强中国人民同印度尼西亚人民的友好关系，这个任务是不难实现的。
    在我最后这句话译成中文、俄文和英文之后，我要求诸位起立，共同举杯：
    为中国人民的繁荣，
    为中国同印度尼西亚的兄弟般的友谊，
    为世界和平，
    为实现建立新世界的理想，
    为毛泽东主席的健康，干杯！
