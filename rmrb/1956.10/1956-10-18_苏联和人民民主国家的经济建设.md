    Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries' Economic Construction
    ·SOVIET UNION·
    Light Industry Production Achieves Remarkable Results
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th - TASS reports: In the first nine months of this year, Soviet light industry not only completed its plan but also overproduced by 2.8 billion rubles worth of products.

    Light industry enterprises produced 7.4 billion rubles more in products during this period than in the same period last year. The output of most major consumer goods increased. For example, silk fabrics increased by 50%, linen fabrics by 26%, shoes by 12 million pairs, sewn goods by 2 billion rubles, and artificial fiber production by 14,000 tons.

    During this period, more than 10,000 of the latest automatic looms, a large number of highly productive fine spinning machines, and other machines were installed in Soviet textile mills and textile combines. More than two hundred light industry enterprises are currently under construction or renovation.
     ·KOREA·
    State-Run Farms Will Have a Bumper Harvest
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 17th - Korean state-run farms are currently in the autumn harvest, and a bumper harvest is expected for important crops such as rice, corn, and potatoes. It is estimated that this year's grain production will be 2.6 times that of 1953, and vegetable production will be 19 times that of 1953.

    In the three years since the war, state-run farms have expanded their cultivated land area by more than 11,900 chongbo (one chongbo is approximately 15 mu), and have added a large number of tractors. State Farm No. 5, the largest farm in the republic with more than 4,000 chongbo of land, has completely mechanized all its cultivation. On average, 80% of the land on each farm is cultivated by machines. These farms have also built housing, hospitals, and clubs, etc.

    The number of livestock on the farms has also greatly increased since the war. Meat supplies this year will be six times that of 1953. There are now more than 8,000 pigs on the farms, which is six times the number in 1953, and the number of dairy cows is more than three times that of 1953.
    ·CZECHOSLOVAKIA·
    Construction of the First Underground Hydroelectric Power Station
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 17th - Czechoslovakia's first underground hydroelectric power station is under construction near Lipno.

    This underground hydroelectric power station is also the first such power station in Central Europe.

    The hydroelectric power station is located on the upper reaches of the Vltava River, built 160 meters below the ground. The 250-meter-long dam built at Lipno will impound 300 million cubic meters of water from the Vltava River in a lake. Then, the lake water flows through a tunnel to the underground hydroelectric power station, driving the turbines to generate electricity under a large head.

    The hydroelectric power station has two turbines, one of which will start generating electricity by the end of 1958.
       ·ROMANIA·
    Chemical Industry Overfulfills Quarterly Plan
    Xinhua News Agency, 16th - According to the Romanian News Agency on the 15th: In the first three quarters of this year, Romania's chemical industry completed 107.2% of its total output plan, an increase of 19.2% over the same period last year. Among them, phosphate fertilizer increased by 19% and medicines increased by 35%.

    Chemical industrial enterprises also began manufacturing some new products this year.

    As early as 1955, the total output of Romania's chemical industry had increased to about three times that of 1951. After expanding production this year, the chemical industry can not only guarantee domestic needs, but also increase the total value of its product exports by half compared to last year.
       ·ALBANIA·
    Power Generation Increases Tenfold Compared to Pre-Liberation
    Xinhua News Agency, 17th - According to TASS: Albania's current power generation has increased tenfold compared to pre-liberation levels.

    In the nearly twelve years since liberation, many new power stations have been built successively in various places. The Lenin Hydropower Station, as well as the thermal power stations attached to the Stalin Textile Factory, the Valona Cement Factory, and the Maliq Sugar Factory, were put into production during the first Five-Year Plan period (1951-1955) alone. Not long ago, a thermal power station attached to the Cërrik Oil Refinery with a generating capacity of 5,000 kilowatts also began generating electricity.

    During the second Five-Year Plan, which began this year, Albania's electrification will develop more rapidly. The Hoxha Hydropower Station, newly built on the Mati River with a generating capacity of 20,000 kilowatts, will begin supplying electricity to industry by 1958. When the entire power project is completed, it will help build a unified power system in the country, increasing the country's power generation to about twice that of 1955 by 1960.

    苏联和人民民主国家的经济建设
    ·苏　联·
    轻工业生产获得卓越成绩
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：在今年头九个月中，苏联轻工业除了完成计划以外，还超额生产了二十八亿卢布的产品。
    轻工业部各企业在这个时期中生产的产品比去年同期增加了七十四亿卢布。最主要的消费品的产量都增加了。例如，丝织品增加了50％，麻织品增加了26％，鞋增加了一千二百万双，缝纫品增加了二十亿卢布，人造纤维的产量增加了一万四千吨。
    在这个时期中，苏联各纺织厂和纺织联合工厂中安装了一万多台最新的自动织机、大量的生产效能很高的精纺机和其他机器。目前还有两百多个轻工业企业正在兴建和改建中。

    国营农场将获得丰收
    新华社平壤17日电　朝鲜的国营农场目前正在秋收，今年种植的重要作物水稻、玉蜀黍、马铃薯等可得到丰收。估计今年谷物产量可达到1953年的二点六倍，蔬菜产量可达到十九倍。
    战后三年来，国营农场共扩大了耕地面积一万一千九百多町步（一町步约合十五市亩），增设了大量的拖拉机。现在拥有四千多町步土地的共和国最大的农场——国营五号农场，所有的耕作已经完全机械化。各农场的土地平均有80％是用机器耕的。这些农场还建设了住宅、医院和俱乐部等。
    战后各农场的家畜数量也大大增加。今年供应的肉类可以达到1953年的六倍。现在各农场共养了八千多头猪，这等于1953年的六倍，乳牛数达到那时的三倍多。
    ·捷克斯洛伐克·
    建设第一座地下水电站
    新华社布拉格17日电　捷克斯洛伐克第一座地下水力发电站正在利普诺附近加紧建造。
    这座地下水电站同时也是中欧的第一座这样的水电站。
    水电站位于弗尔塔瓦河上游，建筑在地面以下一百六十公尺的地方。在利普诺建筑的长达二百五十公尺的拦河坝，将把三亿立方公尺的弗尔塔瓦河河水拦蓄在一个湖中。然后，湖水通过隧道流向地下水电站，在造成很大的落差的情况下推动水轮机发电。
    这座水电站共拥有两部水轮机，其中一部将在1958年年底开始发电。
       ·罗马尼亚·
    化学工业超额完成季度计划
    新华社16日讯　据罗马尼亚通讯社15日讯：在今年头三季中，罗马尼亚的化学工业完成了总产量计划107.2％，比去年同一时期多19.2％。其中磷肥增加了19％，药品增加了35％。
    化学工业企业还在今年开始制造了一些新的产品。
    还在1955年，罗马尼亚的化学工业总产量就已增加到1951年的三倍左右，今年化学工业扩大生产以后，不仅能够保证国内需要，而且可以把它的产品的出口总额比去年增加一半。
       ·阿尔巴尼亚·
    发电量比解放前增加十倍
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚目前的发电量已经增加到解放前的十倍。
    在解放以来的将近十二年中，各地相继建立了许多新的发电站。单单在第一个五年计划（1951—1955年）期间投入生产的就有列宁水电站，以及在斯大林纺织工厂、发罗拉水泥工厂和马立克城制糖厂附设的火力发电站。不久以前，塞立克炼油厂附设的一个发电能力为五千瓩的火力发电站也开始发电了。
    在从今年开始的第二个五年计划期间，阿尔巴尼亚电气化事业将更加迅速地发展起来。马蒂河上新建的发电能力为两万瓩的霍查水电站到1958年就要开始向工业输送电力。这座电力工程全部落成后，将有助于在国内建成一个统一的动力系统，使全国的发电量到1960年时增加到1955年的两倍左右。
