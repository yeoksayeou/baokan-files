    Literary Books Should Have Illustrations

    Many books, especially literary works, have very crude, stiff, and monotonous cover designs. The "Lu Xun Letters" and "Ai Qing Poems" published by the People's Literature Publishing House in 1953 and 1954 are examples of this. The collections such as "Poetry," "Short Stories," and "Essays and Features" published by the same publishing house recently are much better than before, but still far from satisfactory. Readers hope to see a variety of cover styles that are novel, eye-catching, and rich in national artistic style. In terms of cover design, we need to learn from Mr. Lu Xun's spirit. He was very particular about the covers of his books. For example, "Wandering" had a cover designed by the famous painter Tao Yuanqing. The cover of "Call to Arms" is simple, elegant, and unique, making it unforgettable. A beautiful cover design first attracts the reader's attention. Therefore, sufficient importance should be attached to it.
    The phenomenon of not paying attention to illustrations in literary works is also quite common now. Excellent modern works like some of Mr. Lu Xun's novels, Mao Dun's "Midnight," and Zhou Libo's "Hurricane" have hardly had any illustrations created for them.
    Illustrations in literary works not only increase the reader's interest while reading, but also help readers understand the characters, environment, and events in the book. It is hoped that the publishing industry will organize painters and art workers to participate in the cover design and illustration work of books, and it is also hoped that painters and art workers will take the initiative to cooperate with writers to take on this responsibility.　Zhou Yucang

    文学书籍应该有插图
    许多书籍，特别是文学作品，封面设计很粗糙，呆板、单调，人民文学出版社1953年和1954年出版的“鲁迅书简”和“艾青诗选”即是一例。近来该社出版的“诗”“短篇小说”“散文特写”等选集，虽然比过去好多了，但是还远不能令人满意。读者希望看到新颖、醒目，并且富有民族艺术风格的多种封面样式。在封面设计方面，我们有必要学习鲁迅先生的精神。他对书籍的封面是很讲究的，例如“彷徨”，封面就是请著名画家陶元庆设计的。“呐喊”的封面，朴素、大方、而且别致，令人难忘。封面设计得美，首先就吸引读者的注意力。因此，要予以足够的重视。
    现在不重视文学作品插画的现象也相当普遍。像鲁迅先生的一些小说，茅盾的“子夜”，周立波的“暴风骤雨”等现代优秀作品，几乎就没有人为它们作过一幅插画。
    文学作品中有插画，不仅能增加读者阅读时的兴趣，而且能帮助读者理解书中的人物、环境和事件。希望出版界组织画家和美术工作者参加书籍的封面设计和插画工作，也希望画家和美术工作者主动地同作家配合，把这个责任担当起来。　周裕苍
