Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: French public continues to protest the French authorities' arrest of five Algerian national leaders. Statements on this matter have been issued by: the Administrative Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor, the Central Committee of the Human Rights League, and Jacques Madaule, a member of the Presidium of the National Peace Council. These statements uniformly emphasize that the French authorities' arbitrary actions prove their unwillingness to seek a solution to the Algerian problem through peaceful means. The statements firmly demand the immediate release of those arrested.

According to reports from "Liberation," the Socialist parliamentary group in France held a meeting in the National Assembly on October 25th, prior to the vote of confidence on the Mollet government. A rather heated debate took place at the meeting. Some Socialist members of parliament criticized the government's policy in Algeria, particularly the French authorities' arrest of the five leaders of the "Algerian National Liberation Front."

"Liberation" also stated that the arrest of the Algerian leaders has also caused dissatisfaction among some French diplomats. According to the newspaper, Baraduc, who had agreed in principle to serve as the French ambassador to Morocco, has now refused this appointment. Le Rese, the French ambassador to Tunisia who was recalled to Paris, is reportedly planning to submit his resignation. The newspaper also reported that Chavaillaz, the Socialist Under-Secretary of State for Moroccan and Tunisian Affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Badin, the head of the Political Department of the Office of the Under-Secretary of State for Moroccan and Tunisian Affairs, also intend to resign.

    法国政界和公众人士
    要求释放阿尔及利亚领袖
    据新华社讯　法国公众继续抗议法国当局逮捕五名阿尔及利亚民族领袖。就这个事件发表声明的有：法国总工会行政委员会、人权联盟中央委员会以及全国和平理事会主席团委员雅克·马多尔。这些声明一致强调说，法国当局专横的行为证明，它不愿用和平方法谋求解决阿尔及利亚问题。声明坚决要求立刻释放被逮捕的人。
    据“解放报”消息，法国社会党议会党团10月25日在国民议会就对摩勒政府信任问题投票表决以前曾经举行了会议。会上发生了相当激烈的争论。部分社会党议员批评政府在阿尔及利亚的政策，特别批评了法国当局逮捕“阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线”的五个领袖。
      “解放报”还说，逮捕阿尔及利亚领袖一事也引起某些法国外交官的不满。据报纸说，巴罗迪本来已经原则上同意担任法国驻摩洛哥大使的职务，现在拒绝这项决定。被召回巴黎的法国驻突尼斯大使勒斯据说打算呈请辞职。报纸又报道，外交部摩洛哥和突尼斯事务次长社会党人沙瓦里以及摩洛哥和突尼斯事务次长办公室政治部部长巴德万也打算辞职。
