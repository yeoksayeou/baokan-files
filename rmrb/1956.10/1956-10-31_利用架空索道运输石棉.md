Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 29th. The Sichuan State-owned Asbestos Mine has completely switched to using aerial ropeways for transporting asbestos. Asbestos mined from high-altitude mining areas such as Daping Mountain, Jianshibaobao, and Fenshuiyan is now transported via cable cars along aerial ropeways that traverse steep cliffs, reaching the asbestos refining and production departments at a speed of 500 meters per minute.

The newly built aerial ropeway at this mine is 9,880 meters long and is divided into 37 ropeway stations. Its transportation capacity reaches 370 tons per day, more than four times higher than the previous manual and animal-powered transportation.

Transporting asbestos mined from high-altitude areas to the refining and production departments for processing is an important part of the asbestos mine's production process. In the past, transportation by manual labor and animal power faced many difficulties. Most of the people participating in the temporary transportation were farmers from nearby areas, who only helped with transportation during the slack winter season, and therefore could not meet the needs of production. Last year, more than 500 farmers and over 400 donkeys and horses participated in the transportation, carrying only over 700 tons of asbestos per month. Now, only 118 ropeway workers are needed, and it only takes five days to transport more than 700 tons of asbestos.

    利用架空索道运输石棉
    新华社成都29日电　四川国营石棉矿运输石棉的工作，已经全部由架空索道进行。从大坪山、尖石包、分水岩等高山采矿区采下的石棉，现在都乘着滑车，穿过悬岩的架空索道，以每分钟滑行五百公尺的速度，到达石棉精选生产部门。
    这个矿新建成的架空索道有九千八百八十公尺长，分成三十七个索道站。它的运输量每天达三百七十吨，比过去人力和畜力的运输量高四倍多。
    把高山矿区采出的石棉运到精选生产部门加工，是石棉矿生产过程中的一个重要环节。过去靠人力和畜力运输有很多困难。参加临时运输的大部分是附近地区的农民，他们只有在冬季农闲期间抽空帮助运输，因而不能满足生产需要。去年参加运输的农民有五百多人和驴马四百多匹，每月才运七百多吨石棉。而现在只需一百一十八个索道工，花五天时间就可以把七百多吨石棉运完。
