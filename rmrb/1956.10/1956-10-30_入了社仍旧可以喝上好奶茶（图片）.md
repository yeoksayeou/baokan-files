Even after joining the cooperative, it's still possible to enjoy good milk tea.
Agricultural production cooperatives in Qinghai Province are very attentive to the customs and habits of their minority ethnic group members. The Tibetan people have a predilection for drinking milk tea, and the cooperatives allow them to continue owning and raising their milk cows privately. This is Lhamo-jie, a female member of the Xianfeng Third Agricultural Cooperative in Guide County, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, milking her cow. To the left is her four-year-old son.

    入了社仍旧可以喝上好奶茶
    青海省的农业生产合作社很注意照顾少数民族社员的风俗习惯。藏民嗜好喝奶茶，社里允许他们的奶牛仍旧私有私养。这是海南藏族自治州贵德县先锋第三农业社女社员拉莫姐正在挤奶，左边的是她的四岁儿子。　　新华社记者　杨立本摄
