    Autumn Musings
    It has been said since ancient times that poets mostly view autumn as a season of sorrow. From the Book of Songs onwards, there's the saying "The autumn day is bleak, all the plants wither." Qu Yuan's "The Lady of the Xiang" contains the lines "The autumn wind sighs softly, the waves of Dongting ripple as the leaves fall from the trees," written with such far-reaching intent, elegant rhythm, and graceful implication! Yet, no matter how elegant or implicated, it still can't conceal the "sadness" in his writing. By the time we get to Song Yu's "Nine Arguments," it's become even more extreme, beginning with "Alas, the air of autumn!" followed by a series of "shivering," "chilling," "empty," "lonely," "miserable with increasing sighs," "grieved and disturbed" ... According to his writing, the whole world and universe are filled with a "sad air" that makes one "unable to be comforted." There are countless examples after this; even the old Du Fu couldn't help but say, "Growing old, I force myself to take solace in the sadness of autumn." It's no wonder there's the ancient saying "autumn scholar's sorrow."
    The sorrow of the ancients had its reasons, determined by their times. One must not forget that behind "The autumn day is bleak," there is also "The chaos and separation are painful, where shall we return?" The rest can be inferred. We today do not need to "appreciate" the ancients' sentiment of sorrow in autumn. For the same reason, there is no need to obliterate "chaos and separation," forcing modern thoughts and feelings upon the ancients, seizing upon "sorrow in autumn" to severely lecture them.

    The impression autumn gives people varies not only with time but also with location. The English poet Keats' famous poem "Ode to Autumn" is most pleasing. But he begins by saying that autumn is a "Season of mists," which doesn't evoke the same feeling or resonance in me. In my view, growing up in northern China, the most important feature of autumn is its clear brightness. It is said that people in Fujian call autumn "Great Brightness," named in relation to the "Small Brightness" of March. I feel that autumn is worthy of this fine name without the slightest shame. When our poets write about autumn, whether it's Fan Zhongyan's "Azure sky, red leaves," or Huang Tingjian's "Fallen trees on a thousand mountains, the sky vast, a clear river, the moon distinct," or Zhang Wenqian's "Fragrant grass with feeling, the setting sun silent; geese flying across the southern bank, people leaning on the western tower," in short, there is no "mist" in their meaning (although Fan also said "Cold mist on the waves is green"). A predecessor's collection of poems was named "Autumn Brightness Collection." What a great Autumn Brightness! This word "brightness" carries the most weight, capturing the spirit of a clear autumn. How different it is from "mist"!

       ＊＊＊
    However, reading on from that first half-line of Keats' poem, it truly describes the scene well. He writes that autumn "For Summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells," causing the bees to feel that the warm days are endless" (This is plain speech, I can't translate poetry). This really captures "Autumn Brightness." This is to illustrate how lovely autumn is to people both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, and that it is not always sorrowful.
          ＊＊＊
    Keats also says that autumn is a season of mellow fruitfulness, full of color, aroma, and taste. This is also great. The original meaning of our character "秋" (autumn) is "the ripening of grain." Therefore, a good harvest year is called "有秋" (having autumn). March is called "竹秋" (bamboo autumn), April is called "麦秋" (wheat autumn) - Bai Juyi once said: "Luoyang in the month of wheat autumn". The season for harvesting wheat in a year is naturally "wheat autumn"; the season for harvesting rice and late rice is "大秋" (great autumn). Gengsangzi said it well: "Attain autumn and all treasures are made," what an auspicious season it is, and how is it "sorrowful"?
    Throughout history, there have been countless festivals in a year, from the Lantern Festival to Laba Festival. Today, the three major festivals—Spring Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, and Mid-Autumn Festival—are always "celebrated" by the people; the rest are dispensable, either celebrated or not. The Spring Festival needs no explanation. Why do the Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival have such great power, deeply rooted in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people for thousands of years? Is it really just an excuse for people to eat zongzi and mooncakes? I'm afraid it's not that simple; there must be a reason. I think the Dragon Boat Festival falls during the summer harvest, and the Mid-Autumn Festival is precisely the time of the autumn harvest. Since ancient times, when people celebrate these two major festivals, I'm afraid there is significance beyond eating zongzi and admiring the moon, right?
        ＊＊＊
    In fact, even the "sorrow" of ancient autumn scholars need not be rigidly viewed, insisting that "sorrow" is sadness, negativity, unhealthiness, and undesirable. The word "悲" (sorrow) originally had the meanings of "feeling" and "consideration," actually roughly equivalent to "thinking." The golden wind and jade dew of this season, breathing in a new atmosphere, truly make people feel easily and think more. This is not necessarily a bad thing. It makes people cool and refreshed from the summer heat, awake from drowsiness, calm from impatience, immersed from shallowness, grown from childishness, and thoughtful from purposelessness. A school year starts in autumn, which makes great sense. For other endeavors, especially scientific research and academic exploration, it seems that "the plan for the year lies in autumn" is more effective than "the plan for the year lies in spring."
    So, while we don't need to praise the "sorrow" of the ancients, we might as well take advantage of this great autumn light to become "autumn scholars" who use our brains a little more.

    秋日闲话
    茶客
    古来诗人多把秋看作悲愁的季节。从诗经起，就说“秋日凄凄，百卉具腓”。屈大夫在“湘夫人”里有“袅袅兮秋风，洞庭波兮木叶下”的句子，写得何等意远韵长、风流蕴藉！然而任它风流煞、蕴藉煞，也还是掩不住笔底下的“悲”意。到宋玉的“九辩”，那就变本加厉，开头便是“悲哉秋之为气也！”接着是一连串的“萧瑟兮”“憭栗兮”“泬寥兮”“寂漻兮”“惨凄增欷兮”“怆怳懭悢兮”……。照他写来，漫天地、彻宇宙都是一片令人“不可为怀”的“悲气”。从这以下，举不胜举；连老杜也不免要说一声“老去悲秋强自宽”。然则就难怪有“秋士悲”的古语了。
    古人的悲，自有其原由，那是为其时代所决定的。不能忘记“秋日凄凄”的后面，就还有“乱离瘼矣，爰其适归”。余可类推。今天的我们大可不必“欣赏”古人的这种悲秋的情绪。同样理由，也就无须乎抹杀“乱离瘼矣”，强古人以今人之思想感情，抓住“悲秋”，将古人大大教训一顿。
          ＊＊＊
    秋给人的印象，不但因时而异，而且也因地而异。英国济慈（Keats）的名篇“咏秋”（OdetoAutumn）最为可喜。但是他一上来便说：秋是“烟雾霏微的季节（Season of mists）”这怎么也引不起我的同感和共鸣。秋，在生长于中国北方的我看来，它最重要的特色就是晴明。据说闽人称秋为“大清明”，相对于三月里的“小清明”而命名。我觉得秋足以当此佳名而略无愧色。我们的诗人写秋，不管是范希文的“碧云天、红叶地”也好，黄山谷的“落木千山天远大，澄江一道月分明”也好，张文潜的“芳草有情，夕阳无语；雁横南浦，人倚西楼”也好，总之，只不见有“烟雾”的意味（尽管范公也说“波上寒烟翠”）。有一位前辈的集子取名叫“秋明集”。好一个秋明！这个明字下得最有分量，摄尽晴秋之神。它和“烟雾”却是多么不同啊！
       ＊＊＊
    然而济慈的诗从这半句往下读，便实实写得对景起来了。他写道：秋“给蜜蜂开放出越来越多的晚花，致使蜂儿们觉得暖日是没有尽头的”（这是大白话，诗，我是译不来的）。这真真写煞“秋明”了。借以说明，秋给古今中外的印象是多么可爱，何尝总是可悲呢？
          ＊＊＊
    济慈又说：秋是色香味俱足的成熟丰收的季节（Mellow fruitfulness）。这又大好。我们的“秋”字本义就是“禾谷熟也”。所以年成好就叫“有秋”。三月叫“竹秋”，四月叫“麦秋”——白香山曾说：“洛下麦秋月”。一年中收麦子的季节当然是“麦秋”；收稻谷晚禾的季节呢，则是“大秋”。庚桑子说得好：“正得秋而万宝成”，这是多么吉祥的季节啊，也何尝是“可悲”的呢？
    古来一年中的节日，从上元起，到腊日止，不知有多少。到今天，三大节——春节、端午、中秋——始终为人民所必“过”；其余的，可有可无了，或过或不过了。春节，不待多说。端午和中秋，为何也有这么大力量，历数千年之久深入数亿人民之心呢？难道真是人们借口好吃粽子和月饼吗？怕未必这样简单，其中定有道理。我想，端午正当夏收之时，中秋恰是秋成之候。人民从很古以来，要过这两大节，恐怕有其食粽和赏月之类以外的意义吧？
        ＊＊＊
    其实，就连古来的秋士“悲”、也不必拘看，认定“悲”就是悲伤、消极、不健康、要不得。“悲”字原有“感触”“顾念”的涵义，实际略相当于“思”。这个季节的金风玉露，呼吸一新，确实使人易感、多思。这倒不一定就是什么坏事。它使人从暑热中而凉爽，从昏沉中而清醒，从急躁中而沉静，从浮浅中而沉潜，从幼稚中而成长，从无所用心中而多所思考。一个学年以秋为首，大有道理。对于其他事业，特别是科学研究、学术探讨之类，与其“一年之计在于春”，似乎也不如“一年之计在于秋”更为得计。
    那么，我们固然不必称赏古人的“悲”，可是倒也不妨趁此大好秋光，作个多动点脑筋的“秋士”。
