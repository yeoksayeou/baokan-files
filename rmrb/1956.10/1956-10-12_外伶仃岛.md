    Wai Lingding Island
    Han Xiao
    Speaking of fear at the Fearful Shoal,
    Sighing loneliness in the Lingding Sea.
          —Wen Tianxiang, who gave you such a name? It sounds so cold and desolate! Wai Lingding! On a moonlit night, I saw a riot of colors on this thousand-year-old desolate island! Golden avenues shaded by swaying trees, lush green vegetable gardens filled with croaking frogs, fishing boats moored in Hebao Bay, and bright lights shining from the cooperative's building. Coconut trees stand like staunch sentries, hanging red flowers resemble tasseled lanterns, roses and jasmine exude fragrance, and banana groves applaud visitors. Soldiers sit under grape trellises, accompanied by the melodious sound of the huqin, fresh pineapples are placed on stone tables, and flower pots are filled with daffodils and evergreen plants. A long string of bamboo pipes runs down the hillside, carrying gurgling water. Discharged soldiers shower with "running water," cooled by the refreshing sea breeze. Night-blooming jasmine has just awakened, sunflowers are already dreaming, little pigeons are still cooing, and goats are gazing at the stars. Wai Lingding! You are very, very far from the mainland, but you are not lonely at all; you are a garden in the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland, a sea fortress, the eyes of the motherland!

    外伶仃岛
    韩笑
    惶恐滩头说惶恐
    伶仃洋里叹伶仃
          ——文天祥是谁给你起这么个名字？让人听起来冷冷清清！外伶仃啊！我在月明之夜，看见你这千年的荒岛上一片万紫千红！金黄的大路树影摇动，青青的菜园阵阵蛙鸣，渔船儿停在荷包湾里，合作社的楼上灯火通明。椰子树像坚劲的了望兵，吊红花像带穗的灯笼，玫瑰和茉莉吐露芬芳，香蕉林向来访者鼓掌欢迎。战士们坐在葡萄架下，胡琴伴着悠扬的歌声，石桌上有刚摘下的菠萝，花盆里栽满水仙和万年青。山坡上有一长串竹筒，那里面流水淙淙，下岗的战士用“自来水”淋浴，吹来阵阵凉爽的海风。夜来香刚刚睡醒，向日葵已经入梦，小鸽子还咕咕叫着，山羊望着天上的星星。外伶仃啊！你离大陆很远很远，但是你一点也不孤伶；你是祖国锦绣河山中的一个花园，你是海上的堡垒，祖国的眼睛！
