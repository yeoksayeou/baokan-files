Just Because the Motherland Needs Long-Staple Cotton
By Our Special Correspondent Liu Xiao Wu

	There is a team.
	Nowadays, there are so many new things, happening every day, everywhere.
	In Turpan, people are talking about it, discussing it. More than two months ago, at the end of February, early March, the ground hadn't thawed, and people didn't dare go out much. They didn't know where a team came from, trucks bringing people batch after batch. Sometimes it was late at night. People could only hear the "toot-toot" of the trucks, the horns blaring. As soon as the trucks stopped, people started chattering like a boiling pot. Before long, with a whistle, the trucks would drive away. The streets, the night, quiet. Sometimes, they came during the day, and now people could see clearly. What kind of team was this? Men, women, even people holding babies. The trucks, who knows how far they had traveled, were covered in dust. As soon as the trucks stopped, people jumped out, not caring about eating or drinking, first finding water to wash their faces. Otherwise, you really couldn't see their noses and eyes. Regardless of the cold, people surrounded them, watching, the more they watched, the more surprised they became, the more they wanted to understand. The trucks drove off again. Not only children, but even young men and old men chased after them in droves. But strangely, the trucks didn't follow the highway, leaving the city and heading south. South? Where to?
	In the city, everyone had their own business, so they had to wait for someone from the south of the city to come. They asked village after village, and each village gave the same answer: "They went south."
	Finally, they asked Huangzhuangzi. The more people asked, the more worried they became. This was already on the edge of the Gobi Desert. They couldn't go further south. But the people of Huangzhuangzi still said the same thing.
	They waited for a village cadre to come, who knew the most about the matter. That day, before dawn, several people went to the fields south of the city. A karez well water, flowing like a river, blocked the road. They tried it, it was deep, wide, and cold, with ice floes flowing with the water, like ten thousand sharp knives. Touching it would draw blood. Everyone looked worried, no one dared to cross. Just then, the trucks came, stopped there, people jumped out, carrying their luggage, lined up. The captain gave an order, and they marched south in neat order. How could this be allowed! Just as they were about to shout, "Comrades, stop!" They took off their shoes, rolled up their trousers, and jumped into the water one after another. Did the ice turn hot when it met them?
	"Where exactly are they going?"
	"What exactly are they going to do?"

	The County Party Secretary Told Me
	One evening, finding a free moment, the County Party Secretary didn't have a meeting, and I went to ask him if he knew about this. He smiled and nodded, saying, "I know, but to explain it, it would take a long time."
	Unable to resist my repeated requests, he had to say:
	"Three or four years ago, the leader accompanied Soviet experts to study the sky and the land here. The experts said: Turpan's climate is suitable for growing long-staple cotton. It is said that this is a very valuable economic crop in industry. The state's prescribed price is that one jin of long-staple cotton is equal to two and a half jin of ordinary cotton. From this, you can easily see how precious it is, and of course, you can see how much the country needs it. According to the experts' opinion, in Turpan, sorghum should be eliminated, wheat can only be planted in cotton rotation fields, and as much wasteland as possible should be reclaimed.
	This was three years ago.
	After that, experts from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Water Resources, and even the Friendship Farm in the far northeast, have been constantly coming here. This shows how much importance the higher authorities attach to this place and this work.
	The Production and Construction Corps is determined to produce long-staple cotton for the motherland. Last year, it jointly conducted a survey and measurement with the Autonomous Region's Water Conservancy Bureau and the Wasteland Survey and Design Bureau. They found a piece of land at the foot of the Juejun Tagh Mountains, near Aiding Lake, in the Gobi Desert. The soil is fertile and has low alkalinity. As long as there is water, it can be planted. The initial plan is to build a farm with 180,000 mu of land. As long as two years are used, long-staple cotton can grow on this large area of land. A conservative estimate is that 20 million jin of seed cotton can be harvested in a year. Can you say this is a small matter? Our Turpan County has a total cultivated area of just over 170,000 mu. With this, the cultivated area can be doubled. To put it jokingly, although Turpan is a small county, it is famous throughout the country, and everyone loves it. Creating another Turpan in two years is a contribution to the motherland and the people, isn't it!
	I heard that once this farm is built, everything from sowing to picking will be done by machines. Therefore, it was named 'State-Owned Hongxing Long-Staple Cotton Mechanical Farm.'"

	Water Floods the Flaming Mountains
	With excitement and admiration, I wanted to visit this farm.
	After reading my letter of introduction, the transportation captain said, "The truck delivering grain left this morning, and we still need to deliver coal, but we can't leave at noon."
	So, I had to wait.
	The captain pointed me to a room, a Uyghur house with a skylight, quite simple, with no furnishings, just a mat on the ground against the wall. People were sitting there, one next to another, probably all waiting for the truck. At this time, all eyes were on one person, a young man, wearing a military uniform, his face tanned red and purple by the sun. Being stared at by everyone, he was a little embarrassed, and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand, even though there was no sweat there. He said:
	"Really, comrades, there's really nothing to say! I just spent seven days and seven nights looking at our Daheyan River, which was also requested by the leader."
	Despite his modesty, his words were very attractive, and people almost shouted, rather than said:
	"Then tell us about our Daheyan!"
	"We want to know about Daheyan!"
	"Our Daheyan," how intimate that sounds!
	To be honest, since talking with the County Party Secretary, I've been worried about one thing: reclaiming wasteland in the Gobi Desert is a good thing, but what about the water? Turpan's annual precipitation is only 30 millimeters (yesterday I read in the newspaper that a rain in Hunan reached 300 millimeters). There is a lot of snowmelt from the Bogda Mountains, but it can't flow over the Flaming Mountains. The Flaming Mountains are simply a water dam for Turpan, a bare red mountain range, lined up in the north, with no trees or grass, looking like a blazing fire. It is said that there was no such mountain before. Millions of years ago, there was a mountain-building movement that broke through the flat land and stood tall, throwing the gravel and rocks on its body to the foot of the mountain, forming a thick layer. As soon as the water reached here, it seeped into the gravel layer and was blocked by the Flaming Mountains. Fortunately, this mountain wasn't built tightly, and there were some gaps of all sizes. The water squeezed out of these gaps and flowed to the south of the mountain; but the south of the mountain also had a layer of gravel, which also seeped. I don't know which dynasty or generation, a capable person invented the karez well, drawing water from under the gravel layer to the arable land. After this labor, the current Turpan was created. But building a karez well is not an easy task. As the saying goes, "Grandfather built the karez all his life, father used the water, and by the grandson's generation, it's dry again." In Turpan, water is so difficult! Now, if we want to plant 180,000 mu of land, how much water is needed! How many karez wells would have to be built! How can this be imagined! How can this not be worrying!
	Now, they are talking about Daheyan.
	This young water conservancy worker went to survey Daheyan, not for the first time, but to re-examine whether the hydrological data on which the water conservancy plan was based was accurate. The data said that every year during this period, from April to May, the water is at its lowest. How low is it? Is it enough? So he followed Daheyan River, deep into the Bogda Mountains. He said: "The water of Daheyan mainly has several sources. In summer, the snow melts from the high mountains, coupled with heavy rains every two or three days. In June, it enters the flood season, when ten thousand torrents rush down the mountain."
	"How big is it?" People asked:
	"More than ten cusecs." (More than ten cubic meters per second) He replied:
	"What about when the water is low?"
	"Now is the lowest time, with no rain or snowmelt, relying on the springs at the foot of the mountain."
	"How much is that?"
	"More than three cusecs."
	"Oh!" People breathed a sigh of relief: "That's enough to drink."
	Enough to drink, but how can we get it?
	He turned his face, looked at me, and said confidently, "We plan to build a canal to divert water from Daheyan to the farm."
	Canal? Since ancient times, Turpan has never built a canal. A canal cannot prevent water seepage!
	He also said: "We plan to pave the entire canal with cement."
	"How long is it?"
	"Fifty-three kilometers and eight hundred and ninety meters. Such a canal is not only unprecedented in Turpan, but it is also the most expensive water conservancy project in all of Xinjiang. For this, the Corps held several discussions. Finally, the leader made a decision that no matter how high the cost, it must be built, in order to produce long-staple cotton for the motherland!"
	Turpan, when did you dream that a river could appear on your strong and healthy body, it will flow through the gravel zone, it will break through the Flaming Mountains, it will flow along the city walls, along the villages and towns, flowing! flowing! A magnificent river! A clear and green river! What a nutritious river! It is milk, which will feed your baby; it is blood, which will revive your land that has been sleeping for millions of years; it will make your body stronger, it will make your face more beautiful. In the future, who can not love you more, Turpan!
	The young water conservancy worker was not satisfied with my excitement. He said with enthusiasm filled with fantasy:
	"This is just our preliminary plan! It is to adapt to these 180,000 mu of land. In the second step, we will expand this farm to more than 500,000 mu. In the third step, we will build a new farm. At that time, we will build a reservoir at Shengjinkou."
	Not only me, but everyone was inspired by this plan. People said:
	"At that time, water will really flood the Flaming Mountains."
	Before people's laughter subsided, another person spoke, a fat man who stuttered a bit. He said:
	"Don't just talk about water conservancy projects, you should also talk about farmland construction! You calculate, one general farm, four branch farms, thirty rotation zones, two hundred and seven strip fields, plus trunk canals, branch canals, bucket canals, farm canals, plus how many water diversion canals there must be how many drainage canals, plus roads and bridges, plus..."
	Someone next to me whispered to me that he was doing water conservancy work.
	Suddenly, a bass voice shouted "Report," and a person suddenly stood up from the crowd, saying in a muffled voice:
	"You haven't mentioned the windbreak forest belts!"
	The statistician quickly took over: "Yes, there are also windbreak forest belts, planting 4.5 million trees..." (To be continued)

    就因为祖国需要长绒棉
    本报特约记者　刘萧无
    有一支队伍
    如今这年月，新鲜事儿可真多，天天有，处处有。
    在吐鲁番，人们都在传说着，议论着，两个多月以前，二月底，三月初，地还没解冻，人还不大敢出门，不知从哪儿开来一支队伍，汽车一队一队送到这儿来，有时是深更半夜，人们只能听见汽车嘟嘟声，喇叭连声响。车一停，人像开了锅似的吵嚷着，工夫大不了，哨子一吹，马上，汽车开走了。街上，夜，静悄悄的。有时，白天也来，这下，人们可就看清了，这叫什么队伍呀，有男，有女，还有怀抱的小孩儿，车呀，不知跑了多少路，到处是尘土，车一停，人都跳下来，不顾吃，不顾喝，首先找水洗洗脸，不然，你真看不清他的鼻子眼睛啦。不管冷不冷，人们围住看，越看越惊奇，越看越想弄明白。车又开了，不但是小孩子，就连小伙子，老头儿也都一窝蜂的追着跑。可也怪，汽车没顺着公路开，一出城就往南去了。往南，上哪儿去呢？
    城里，各人都有各人的事，只好等着城南有人来。一个村子接着一个村子问，一个村子接着一个村子都是同样的回答：“往南去了。”
    最后问到黄庄子。人们越问越耽心，这可已经到了戈壁的边沿上了，可不能再往南了。谁知黄庄子的人还是那么说。
    盼来了个村干部，这事数他知道得最清楚。那天，天没亮，几个人到城南地里去，一条坎井水，流成河，横拦在路上，试了试，又深，又宽，又冷，冰碴儿顺水流，就像一万把尖刀子，碰一下，得流血，人人看着发愁，谁也不敢过。正这工夫，汽车来了，停在那儿，人们跳下来，背上行李，排成队，队长一声口令，整整齐齐往南开。这怎么行呢！才要喊叫“同志们，停下吧！”谁知人家已经脱了鞋，挽起裤腿，一个跟着一个跳下水。难道是冰遇见他们也会变热吗？
    “到底他们要上哪儿去呢？”
    “到底他们要去干什么？”
    县委书记告我说
    一天晚上，凑了个空闲，县委书记没开会，我去问他知不知道这回事。他笑着点点头，说：“知道是知道，这事要说嘛，话可就长了。”
    禁不住我一再要求，他只好说：
    “三四年前，首长陪着苏联专家到这儿来，研究了这儿的天，又研究了这儿的地。专家说：吐鲁番的气候适合种长绒棉。据说，这是在工业上极有价值的一种经济作物。国家规定的价格，一斤长绒棉等于两斤半普通棉。从这你就不难看出它是多宝贵，当然也就可以看出国家是多么需要它了。依照专家的意见，吐鲁番这地方，高粱叫它绝迹吧，小麦只能在棉花轮歇地里种，荒地能开多少开多少。
    这是三年以前的事啦。
    以后，农业部的、水利部的、就连远在东北的友谊农场的专家，都不断地到这儿来，可见上级多重视这地方，多重视这工作。
    生产建设兵团决心要给祖国生产长绒棉。去年，和自治区的水利局、荒地勘察设计局联合进行了勘察测量，发现觉军塔格山脚下，艾丁湖畔的戈壁滩里有块地，土质肥沃，碱性小，只要有水就能种。初步规划可以建设一个十八万亩地的农场，只要用两年的时间，这块大面积的土地上就能生长长绒棉。保守一点的估计，一年能收两千万斤籽花。你能说这是一件小事吗。我们吐鲁番，全县现有耕地面积不过十七万多亩，这下，耕地面积就能扩大一倍。说句笑话吧，别看吐鲁番是个小县份，可在全国都有名，人人都爱它。两年的工夫又创造出一个吐鲁番，对祖国，对人民，谁能说这不是个贡献呢！
    听说这个农场建设好，从播种到摘花，全部都用机器操作，所以，给它起了个名字叫‘国营红星长绒棉机械农场。’”
    水漫火焰山
    怀着兴奋和欣佩的心情，我要去访问这个农场。
    运输队长看完了我的介绍信，说：“送粮食的车早晨才开走，还要送炭，可是，晌午头上，开不成。”
    那么，只好等着啦。
    队长指给我一间房子，是个房顶开窗的维吾尔人的房子，够简陋的，什么陈设都没有，只有靠墙根地下铺了一张席。人们坐着，一个挨一个，大概也都是等车的。这时，所有的眼睛可都朝着一个人，是个年青人，穿军装，脸被太阳晒得又红又紫，被大家看得有些窘，用手背擦了擦额角，其实那儿并没汗。他说：
    “真的，同志们，真的没有什么可说呀！不过花了七天七夜时间，看了看咱们的大河沿，这也是首长叫去的。”
    尽管他谦虚，话可很有吸引力，人们简直不是说，而是嚷：
    “那就说说咱们的大河沿吧。”
    “咱们正想知道大河沿呢。”
    “咱们的大河沿”，这说得够多亲切呀！
    说实在的，自从和县委书记谈过话，我就在耽着一份心：戈壁里开荒是好事，水可怎么办呢？吐鲁番全年降水量不过三十公厘（昨天看报，湖南下了一场雨就达三百公厘）。博格达山雪水多，可又流不过火焰山。火焰山简直是吐鲁番的一道拦水坝，光秃秃的红山，屏列在北面，不长树，也不长草，看着就像一盆熊熊的大火。据说，从前并没有这座山，多少万年之前，有一次造山运动，它才突破了平坦的土地，高高地矗立起来，把压在它身上的砾石块扔到山脚下，厚厚的铺了一层。水一到这儿它就渗漏到砾石层下，被火焰山截住了。幸亏这山造得不严密，大大小小有一些空隙，水从这些空隙挤出去流到山南；可是山南照样也有一段砾石层，照样要渗漏。不知是哪朝哪代，出了个能人，发明了坎儿井，从砾石层下把水引出来，引到可耕的土地上。经过了这番劳动，才创造出如今的吐鲁番。但修条坎儿井，那可不是一件容易的事，常言说：“祖父修坎修了一辈子，父亲用上了水，到孙子手里又干啦。”在吐鲁番，水就是这么艰难啊！如今，要种十八万亩地，那得多少水啊！那得修多少条坎儿井呀！这怎么能想像啊！这怎么能叫人不耽心呢！
    现在，他们可正谈着大河沿。
    这位年青的水利工作者去勘察大河沿，并不是第一次的勘察，而是复查一下水利规划所根据的水文资料确实不确实。资料上说，每年这个时期，四五月间，水最小。小到什么程度呢？够不够用呢？所以他顺着大河沿，深入到博格达山。他说：“大河沿的水主要有这样几个来源，夏天，高山的融雪，再加上三天两头下大雨，一到六月就进入洪水期，那真是万道洪流冲下山。”
    “有多大呢？”人们追问了一句：
    “有十个多水。”（每秒钟十立方公尺）他回答：
    “那水小的时候呢？”
    “现在就是最小的时候，又没雨水又没雪水，就靠山脚下的源泉。”
    “那能有多少呢？”
    “三个多水。”
    “噢！”人们轻轻地松了一口气：“那够喝了。”
    够喝是够喝了，可是，怎么才能喝得上呢？
    他侧过脸来，看了看我，胸有成竹地说：“我们计划修条渠，从大河沿引水到农场。”
    渠？从古以来吐鲁番就没有修过渠，渠也无法防止水的渗漏啊！
    他又说：“我们计划这条渠全部都用水泥铺砌。”
    “多长啊？”
    “五十三公里八百九十公尺。这样的渠不但在吐鲁番没有过，就在全新疆也是成本最大的一项水利工程。为这，兵团开了几次讨论会。最后，首长下决心，成本再大也得修，为的是给祖国生产长绒棉啊！”
    吐鲁番，你什么时候梦想过，在你这强大而健壮的身体上能够出现一条河，它将流过砾石带，它将冲破火焰山，它将沿着城廓，沿着村镇，流啊！流啊！波澜壮阔的河呀！澄清碧绿的河呀！多么富有营养的河呀！是乳汁，将要哺育你的婴儿；是血液，将要救活你沉睡了千万年的土地；它将使你的躯干更壮大，它将使你的面貌更美丽。将来，谁能不更加爱你啊，吐鲁番！
    那年青的水利工作者并没有因为我的兴奋而满足，他洋溢着幻想的热情说：
    “这不过是我们的初步计划啊！是适应这十八万亩地的。第二步，我们还要把这农场扩大到五十多万亩。第三步，再建立一个新的农场。到那时，就要在胜金口那儿修一座水库。”
    不但是我，所有的人都为这个计划振奋起来了。人们说：
    “到那时可真要水漫火焰山了。”
    人们的笑声还没落，另一个人说话了，是一个白胖子，说话带点口吃的人，他说：
    “你别光说水利工程啊，你也说说农田建设嘛！你算算，一个总场，四个分场，三十个轮作区，二百○七块条田，加上干渠，支渠，斗渠，农渠，再加上有多少引水渠就得有多少排水渠，再加上道路桥梁，再加上……”
    身旁有个人悄悄地告我说，他是个作水利工作的。
    忽然，一个男低音喊了声“报告”，人丛中猛的站起来一个人，瓮声瓮气的说：
    “你还没说防风林带呢！”
    那个作统计工作的赶紧接过来：“是啊，还有防风林带，种树要种四百五十万棵……”（未完）
