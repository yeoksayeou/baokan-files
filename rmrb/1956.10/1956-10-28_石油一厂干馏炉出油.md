Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 26th - The new crude oil distillation furnace, whose expansion began last year at the Northeast Petroleum No. 1 Factory, produced oil on the 23rd. After this crude oil distillation furnace goes into production, the factory's oil production will increase by a quarter compared to the original amount.

The workers who built this crude oil distillation furnace were originally only able to repair and overhaul some refining equipment. This time, following the model of Soviet refining equipment, they corrected the shortcomings of China's old crude oil distillation furnace and created various new types of equipment such as a crude oil distillation furnace, cooling tower, gas absorption tower, and scrubbing tower, all over ten zhang high. This crude oil distillation furnace not only has several more furnaces than the old one, but the capacity of each furnace is also larger than before.

    石油一厂干馏炉出油
    新华社抚顺26日电　东北石油一厂去年动工扩建的一部新原油干馏炉，在二十三日出油。这部原油干馏炉投入生产后，全厂的产油量比原来提高了四分之一。
    建设这部原油干馏炉的工人，原来只能修配和检修一些炼油设备。这次，他们按照苏联炼油设备的模型，修正了我国旧有原油干馏炉的缺点，创制了高达十多丈的原油干馏炉、冷水塔、瓦斯吸收塔以及洗涤塔等各种新型设备。这部原油干馏炉不仅炉体比旧有的炉体多好几个，而且每个炉体的容量也比过去的加大了。
