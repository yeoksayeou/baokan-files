    Japan Labor-Farmer Party Chairman Kuroda Hisao's Message of Greetings to Chairman Mao on National Day
    Xinhua News Agency, October 3rd: Kuroda Hisao, Chairman of the Japan Labor-Farmer Party, sent a message of greetings to Chairman Mao on the National Day of the People's Republic of China. The full text of the congratulatory message is as follows:

    On the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Labor-Farmer Party represents all the working people of Japan in expressing heartfelt congratulations.
    Since the founding of your country, your people have carried out such great undertakings: in domestic construction, you have already achieved brilliant results in the First Five-Year Plan; and in foreign policy, you have grasped the leading force of the world trend of peaceful coexistence.
    The achievements of your people constantly give great encouragement and hope to the Japanese people who are struggling in the neighboring country separated only by a narrow strip of water and are still under the rule of US-Japanese monopoly capital. This is because the Japanese people deeply understand that the struggle of your people, who have consistently strived to achieve peace, prosperity, and socialism, is closely related to and integrated with the Japanese people's struggle for independence, peace, and democracy.
    Furthermore, under the current situation, in our country, the situation of demanding increased friendly relations with your country, especially demanding the early restoration of normal diplomatic relations, has rapidly risen. Because the broad masses of the people have understood that this is in line with the real interests of the Japanese people and can steadily advance towards the path of lasting peace.
    My party guarantees to complete the task based on the same common understanding as the people of your country, to strive for further enhancing the friendly relations between Japan and China and for the early restoration of diplomatic relations, and hereby extend our congratulations.

    Respectfully to
    Mr. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China
                                      Kuroda Hisao, Chairman of the Labor-Farmer Party
                                                      October 1, 1956

    在国庆节给毛主席的贺词
    新华社3日讯　日本劳农党主席黑田寿男在中华人民共和国国庆节给毛主席的贺词。贺词全文如下：
    欣逢中华人民共和国第七次国庆节，劳动者农民党代表日本全体劳动人民表示由衷的祝贺。
  贵国人民自从建国以来进行了这样的伟大的事业：在国内建设方面已经获得了第一个五年计划的辉煌成果；并且在对外政策方面已经掌握了和平共处这一世界潮流的主导力量。
    贵国人民的这种业绩，不断地给目前在相隔一衣带水的邻国而且仍然处在美日垄断资本的统治之下进行着斗争的日本人民以很大的鼓舞和希望。这是因为，日本人民深深地理解到，一贯努力实现和平、繁荣和社会主义的贵国人民的斗争，是与日本人民争取独立、和平、民主的斗争息息相关，而且结合在一起的。
    并且，在目前的形势之下，在我国要求同贵国增进友好关系，特别是要求早日恢复正常邦交的形势，已经迅速地高涨起来。因为广大人民都已经理解到，这是符合日本人民的现实的利益，而且能够向着持久和平的道路稳步前进的。
    我党保证，要为完成基于同贵国人民一样的共同意识而产生的任务，要为更加增进日本和中国的友好关系并早日恢复邦交而奋斗，谨此致贺。
    谨致
    中华人民共和国主席毛泽东先生
