Shaanxi Province's Soil and Water Conservation Work
Zhao Qin Dan

When people personally visit areas with soil erosion, especially the loess hilly region of northern Shaanxi, they will see a topography of thousands of gullies and ravines, fragmented and broken due to long-term soil erosion. This situation has caused great difficulties for agricultural production. In the nearly two thousand years of history of Luochuan County in northern Shaanxi, the county seat has been relocated three times due to the forward development of gullies. The current county seat is also surrounded by gullies on all sides. This one fact alone is enough to illustrate the severity of the disasters suffered by the people living on the Loess Plateau! On August 8th of this year, the Suide area encountered a rare rainstorm, and the shocking degree of soil erosion was beyond what people could imagine in the past: each mu (approximately 0.16 acres) lost an average of 26,600 jin (approximately 13.3 tons) of topsoil. On farmland on slopes without soil and water conservation measures, soil loss reached a maximum of 59,400 jin (approximately 29.7 tons) per mu. The farmland was covered with large and small gullies. This rainstorm alone caused irreparable damage to autumn and next year's agricultural production. People use the saying "Thousands of gullies and slopes wash away sediment, rolling torrents flow out of the gorges, erosion above causes siltation below, water and drought disasters plague thousands of families" to describe the severity and consequences of soil erosion in the Yellow River basin, which is very apt.

The history of soil erosion disasters is a history of the people's efforts to conserve soil and water and fight against natural disasters. Transforming sloping land into terraced fields is a method created by the people in long-term agricultural production practice to conserve soil and water. Standing on Yellow Dragon Mountain in Shaanxi, you can see the layers of terraces on both sides of the Beiluo River and in the large and small gullies, from the top of the mountain to the bottom of the valley. This is the terraced fields created by the working people over hundreds of years. According to the records of Baishui County, Shaanxi, there were widespread soil-built and stone-built terraces during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty. The Gou'nan Village Qiaogou watershed in this county has an area of 2,522 mu, with 62% being original land and 38% being gullies. Cultivated land accounts for 84.6% of the total area, of which the cultivated land expanded by the masses through terracing accounts for 22% of the total land area, and the yield of terraced fields is 26% higher than that of the original land. The experience of comprehensive terracing shows that according to the slope of the land, building soil ridges along the contour lines, with the soil above being turned downward, coupled with the natural effect of rainwater washing down and silting up, can turn sloping land into horizontal terraced fields. The local proverb "Land without a lip, people starve to death" is a correct evaluation of the guarantee of agricultural production by terraced fields. Xian He Li, an elderly man who looks after a temple in Shaping Temple, Mei County, at the northern foot of the Qinling Mountains, created the experience of "turning mountain slopes into terraced fields and terraced fields into paddy fields" through years of hard work. Starting in 1949, he built terraced fields on slopes with a gradient of 18 degrees. In a few years, he built a total of eight mu of terraced fields and diverted spring water to turn dry land into paddy fields. The yield of rice per mu increased from 360 jin to 650 jin, which was three to five times higher than that of dry land on mountain slopes. The masses praised and envied, saying, "Our Shaping Temple couldn't even afford wheat in the past. We never dreamed that sloping land could be turned into paddy fields!" The village's agricultural production cooperative accepted Xian He Li's experience and formulated a plan to develop 40 mu of paddy fields. The above two typical examples prove that the primary link in developing agricultural production on mountain slopes is to build terraced fields.

In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, the people in mountainous areas have vigorously built terraced fields on slopes, coupled with measures to improve agricultural technology, and have achieved remarkable results. The Wangchang Gou Agricultural Cooperative in Yulin County has actively built terraced fields, increased fertilizer application, and improved cultivation techniques, achieving increased production year after year. In 1951, 427 mu of mountain land yielded 35.75 shi (approximately 4.7 tons) of unprocessed grain. In 1955, under the threat of drought, it yielded 83.3 shi (approximately 11 tons), with the highest yield of 220 jin (approximately 110 kg) per mu of terraced field. The Luo Jia Ping Agricultural Cooperative in Mizhi County produced 180 jin (approximately 90 kg) per mu on a large area of terraced fields in 1955. The Guan Jia Pan Agricultural Cooperative in Suide County has completed 1,590 mu of terraced fields in the past two years. If a portion is built again this autumn, all large areas of sloping land can become terraced fields.

How much water and soil conservation does terracing achieve? The Du Jia Shi Gou Agricultural Cooperative in Mizhi County and the Xin Dian Gou Soil and Water Conservation Experimental Station in Suide County can provide answers. While building terraced fields on slopes, Du Jia Shi Gou widely adopted the ditch and ridge planting method, which can intercept 12.8 cubic meters of soil and store 18.2 cubic meters of water per mu. In addition, the use of horizontal ditches, interception pits, and strip intercropping of pasture from the top of the mountain to the bottom of the valley has basically controlled soil and water loss, achieving "defense everywhere, step-by-step management, control of water and soil, and increased production." The results of the comprehensive terracing experiment at the Xin Dian Gou Soil and Water Conservation Experimental Station in Suide showed that mountain slopes yielded 312 jin (approximately 156 kg) of sorghum and 182 jin (approximately 91 kg) of wheat per mu, with yields three to six times higher than ordinary slopes. On August 8th of this year, Suide experienced a rainstorm. Slopes lost 26,600 jin (approximately 13.3 tons) to 59,400 jin (approximately 29.7 tons) of fertile soil per mu, while terraced slopes reduced soil erosion by an average of 27,000 jin (approximately 13.5 tons) per mu.

Because the fact that terraced fields guarantee high yields and prevent soil erosion has educated the masses, a terracing movement has been widely launched in various places. The Suide area alone completed the initial construction of 670,000 mu of terraced fields this spring.

In terms of the utilization of gullies and ravines, building dams to create land and transforming barren gullies into fertile fields is also an experience that farmers have gained in their long-term struggle against soil erosion. In Anhe District, Yanchang County, which is close to the west bank of the Yellow River, farmers began to manage gullies and ravines very early, using the method of "building dams to create land." During the investigation, dams with a history of 200 years can be found. Select a place in the mountain gully with a small mouth and a large belly and build an earth dam. The method of building earth dams adopts the method of gradually raising the dam body by silting it up year by year or raising it with the silting, which is not only economical and labor-saving, but also conducive to the safety and consolidation of the dam body. At the same time, the dam body is gradually raised, which also gradually expands the area of ​​the silted land. In the past, Anhe District had a total of 967 earth dams. Liu Changyou, 73 years old from Furong Village in this district, has built a total of 10 large silt dams and more than 70 small dams in the past 30 years. Li Yuede built more than 70 mu of silt land dams in his lifetime. The dammed land has sufficient moisture and fertile soil. The average yield of wheat per mu is more than 200 jin (approximately 100 kg), and the maximum yield of cotton per mu is 130 jin (approximately 65 kg) of lint, which are several times higher than slopes. The masses regard the dam land in the gullies as the most guaranteed high-yield land. There is a saying in this area: "When marrying a daughter, you don't need to look, first ask how many dams (silt land dams) there are." This means that dam land can produce more grain, and daughters who marry into families with silt land dams will not be poor.

In the past few years, Shaanxi's mountainous areas have made great achievements in building silt land dams. In the upper reaches of the Wuding River, dams are used to intercept floods and silt land, transforming 100,000 mu of barren beaches and ravines into fertile fields, with a yield of more than 100 jin (approximately 50 kg) of grain per mu, making it a major grain-producing area in Yulin. In the first half of this year, Yanchang County built 837 dams, which can silt out 13,347 mu of fertile dam land. Luonan County launched two dam-building campaigns this spring, completing more than 3,000 silt land dams and valley dams, controlling 421 tributary gullies. The key soil and water conservation area of ​​Jiuyuan Gou in northern Shaanxi experienced a rare flood on August 8th. Although 84 silt land dams suffered partial losses, the area of ​​silt land has expanded to 350 mu. This year's winter wheat sowing and next spring's sowing of tall-stem crops can, under normal circumstances, achieve high yields.

Building small reservoirs to intercept floods is an effective way to manage larger mountain gullies. The five reservoirs in the Jiuyuan Gou watershed in Suide not only basically achieve the purpose of intercepting sediment and storing water, but also expand the irrigated area by more than 1,200 mu. In the near future, small hydropower stations can be built in the reservoirs, and the reservoirs can also be used to develop sideline occupations such as fish and duck farming. In the first half of this year, 28 reservoirs have been completed in northern Shaanxi, and 32 more will be built in the second half of the year. Building small reservoirs, coupled with the use of river water for irrigation, will turn some of the river land and dam land in the mountainous areas of northern Shaanxi into irrigated land.

    陕西省的水土保持工作
    赵秦丹
    人们亲临水土流失区，特别是陕北黄土丘陵区，就会见到由于长期土壤侵蚀，千沟万壑，支离破碎的地形，这种情况给农业生产造成了极大困难。陕北高原洛川县城在近两千年的厂史中，因为沟壑向前发展而迁移三次，目前的县城也处在四面沟壑包围之中。单是这件事就足以说明居住在黄土高原上的人民所遭受的灾害是多么深重！今年8月8日绥德地区遇到了百年来少有的暴雨，土壤冲刷的惊人程度是过去人们不敢想像的：每亩平均流失表层肥土二万六千六百斤，山坡上没有采取水土保持措施的耕地，每亩土壤流失最高达到五万九千四百斤。耕地上布满大大小小的沟壑。仅这一次暴雨，就给今年秋季和明年农业生产造成难以医治的创伤。人们用“千沟万坡冲泥沙，滚滚浊流出山峡，上边冲刷下边淤，水旱灾害祸万家。”的语句，来描述黄河流域水土流失的严重情况和恶果，是十分恰当的。
    水土流失灾害的历史，是人民力求保持水土和同自然灾害斗争的历史。变坡地为梯田，就是人民在长期的农业生产实践中创造的一种保土保水的方法。站在陕西黄龙山上，可以看到北洛河两岸和大小沟道从山顶到沟底层层的梯阶，这就是几百年来劳动人民创造的梯田。根据陕西白水县志记载，在清朝康熙年间就有普遍的土垒石砌的梯田。这个县的沟南村桥沟流域面积是二千五百二十二亩，原地占62％，沟壑占38％，耕地占总面积的84.6％，其中，群众修梯田扩大的耕地占总土地面积的22％，梯田的产量高出原地26％。综合修梯田的经验，按照坡地的坡度，沿等高线修土埂，上边的土向下翻加上自然降雨的上冲下淤的作用，就能使坡地变成水平梯田。当地流传着“地没唇，饿死人。”的谚语，正是对梯田保证农业生产的正确评价。秦岭北麓郿县沙坡寺看庙老人献合礼，在多年辛勤劳动中，创造了“山坡变梯田，梯田变水田”的经验。他从1949年开始，在十八度的坡地上修梯田，几年里共修梯田八亩，引泉水把旱地变成了水田，稻子每亩产量由三百六十斤增加到六百五十斤，高出山坡旱地三至五倍。群众赞扬羡慕地说：“我们沙坡寺过去连麦子吃不上，做梦也想不到坡地还能变成稻田啊！”村里的农业生产合作社接受了献合礼的经验，订出了发展四十亩稻田的计划。上述两个典型事例证明：在山坡地发展农业生产的首要一环是修梯田。
    几年来在党的领导下，山区人民大力修筑坡地梯田，配合改良农业技术的措施，获得了显著的成绩。榆林县王昌沟农业合作社，积极修筑梯田，增施肥料，改良耕作技术，连年得到增产。1951年四百二十七亩山地，收原粮三十五点七五石，1955年在旱灾威胁的情况下收八十三点三石，梯田每亩最高产量为二百二十斤。米脂县罗家坪农业社1955年大面积的梯田每亩产一百八十斤。绥德县关家畔农业社，两年来完成梯田一千五百九十亩，今年秋季再修筑一部分，全部大片坡地都可以成为梯田。
    梯田蓄水保土的作用到底有多大呢？从米脂县杜家石沟农业社和绥德县辛店沟水土保持试验场可以得到答复。杜家石沟在坡地修筑梯田的同时，广泛采用了沟垅种植法，每亩可拦土壤十二点八公方，蓄水十八点二公方，另外利用水平沟、截水坑、牧草带状间作等方法，从山顶到沟底基本上控制了水土流失，达到“处处设防，步步为营，控制水土，提高生产”。绥德辛店沟水土保持试验场的梯田综合试验的结果，山坡地每亩高粱产三百十二斤，小麦产一百八十二斤，产量比一般坡地提高三倍到六倍。今年8月8日绥德降了一次暴雨，坡地上每亩流失肥土二万六千六百斤到五万九千四百斤，而修梯田的坡地平均每亩减少土壤冲刷二万七千斤。
    由于梯田的保证丰产和防止土壤冲刷的事实教育了群众，各地广泛地开展了修梯田运动。仅绥德专区今年春季就完成初修梯田六十七万亩。
    在沟壑的利用方面，筑坝淤地，把荒沟改造为良田，也是农民长期同土壤冲刷现象作斗争的经验。紧靠黄河西岸的延长县安河区，农民很早就开始了沟壑治理，方法就是
  “打坝淤地”，在调查中可以找到有二百年历史的坝埝。在山沟中选定口小肚大的地方，打起土坝。打土坝中采用了淤平逐年加高或者随淤随加的办法，这样既经济省工，又有利于坝身的安全和巩固，同时坝身逐步加高，也就使淤地面积逐步扩大。安河区过去共有土坝九百六十七道。这个区的芙蓉村七十三岁的刘长有，三十年来共修大淤地坝十道，小坝七十多个，李月德一生打坝淤地七十多亩。坝地水分充足，土壤肥沃，小麦每亩平均产量在二百斤以上，棉花每亩最高产量达一百三十斤（皮棉），都比坡地高出几倍。群众把沟里坝地当作最有保证的丰产地，这一带流传着一句话：“嫁女不用看，先问几道埝（淤地坝）。”意思是坝地能多打粮食，女儿嫁给有淤地坝的人家，就不受穷了。
    几年来陕西山区修筑淤地坝的成绩很大。无定河上游河源地区，用坝埝拦洪淤地，把十万亩荒滩涧地改造为良田，每亩产粮食一百斤以上，成为榆林地区主要粮食产地。今年上半年延长县打坝八百三十七道，可淤出肥沃的坝地一万三千三百四十七亩。雒南县今春两次开展打坝运动，完成淤地坝、谷坊三千多道，控制了支沟四百二十一条。陕北水土保持重点韭园沟今年8月8日经受了百年来少有的一次洪水的考验，虽然八十四道淤地坝受到局部损失，但淤地面积已扩大到三百五十亩。今年播种冬麦和明春播种高秆作物，在一般情况下，都可以获得丰产。
    修建小型水库，拦蓄洪水，是治理较大山沟的有效办法。绥德韭园沟流域的五座水库，除了基本上达到拦泥蓄水目的以外，同时扩大灌溉面积一千二百多亩，在不久的将来又可在水库兴建小型水力发电站，同时可以利用水库发展养鱼、养鸭等副业。今年上半年在陕北地区已完成水库二十八座，下半年还将建筑三十二座。修筑小型水库，配合利用河水灌溉，将使陕北山区部分川地和坝地变成灌溉田。
