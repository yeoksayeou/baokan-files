Thoughts on Reading "Contention" Articles
    Hou Fei
    Due to the nature of my editorial work, I often have the opportunity to read articles on ancient writers submitted for publication in which various people contend with each other. Over time, this has created a rigid impression: it seems as if our ancestors were only of two types, one being extremely progressive, and the other being extremely reactionary; one being anti-people writers, and the other being great realist writers. It seems there's no possibility of a third type of writer. Moreover, the same writer often receives sharply contrasting evaluations in the views of two critics, and supposedly, this is all based on the results of research using Marxist viewpoints. For example, Gao Zecheng, the author of "The Story of the Pipa," is hailed by some as the greatest "thinker" and "realist writer," even his advocacy of feudal dogma is considered to fall within the category of the people's ethics and morality; while others denounce him as the most reactionary advocate of feudal doctrines, completely negating his deeply felt sympathy and the genuine reflection of socially tragic situations of his time. By extension, Li Yu, the poet who became the emperor of Southern Tang, is either a patriotic poet or a feudal emperor; Su Dongpo, because he once opposed Wang Anshi's reforms, is virtually removed from literary history, and the great poet Bai Juyi, because he wrote many poems that deeply exposed reality and sympathized with the suffering of the people, leads to the denial of any sympathy or praise for the love between Emperor Xuanzong of Tang and Yang Guifei in his "Song of Everlasting Regret." It's either one or the other, and there seems to be no third possibility. Those who make these arguments each hold to their own extreme, arguing vehemently. In this atmosphere of contention, one often senses an unhealthy tone, namely, that the contention seems not to be about pursuing the truth, or about studying issues based on facts, but rather that both sides in the debate are only trying to defend their own views, selectively searching for arguments. A problem that is inherently very complex, in this kind of contention, becomes simplified into two extremes: yes is yes, no is no. Superficially, they are sharply opposed, but in reality, they don't interfere with each other. They cannot solve the problem, nor can they move the issue forward. Both sides stubbornly cling to the "iron ruler for measuring literature," refusing to yield. As a lover of classical literature, I can't help but harbor a small doubt in this predicament: can writers and works from hundreds or even thousands of years ago truly be completely and accurately separated under this "iron ruler for measuring literature"? In our literary history, there are indeed many such writers who cannot be expelled from the country, nor can they be placed in the ranks of people's writers. Their works present complex and contradictory phenomena, and yet, as literary heritage, they are worthy of our research and acceptance. A serious critic should and must restore their true historical face. Lu Xun has a famous saying: "If there is selection, it is not the whole person; if there is further exaggeration or suppression, it is even further from the truth." This is worthy of reflection by those critics who "hold to their own extreme."

    Perhaps some will say that I am advocating "the doctrine of the mean" or that I cannot escape being labeled as having a "vague viewpoint." However, I think that ancient writers, even in their graves, would hope that their creations would be treated with a scientific attitude by modern people, rather than being blown up to ethereal heights one moment and thrown into the eighteenth level of hell the next, praised one moment and insulted the next, all amidst the clamor of contention. And ordinary readers are even more unwilling to live in this ambiguous and contradictory environment. If this is considered "the doctrine of the mean" or a "vague viewpoint," I hope it can also earn a place in the contention, so that people can see a bit of the true face of history and the ancients, and avoid many disasters and troubles for both the living and the dead.

    读“争鸣”文章有感
    厚非
    由于编辑业务的关系，经常有机会拜读来稿中的有关古代作家的争鸣文章，耳闻目染，久而久之，造成了一种僵硬的感觉：仿佛我们的祖宗，只有两类人，一类是极端进步的，一类是极端反动的；一类是反人民的作家，一类是伟大的现实主义作家，除此之外，根本不可能有第三类作家。而且，同一个作家，往往在两位批评家的看法中，形成鲜明对立的不同评价，而据说这又都是凭借马克思主义观点研究的结果。例如，“琵琶记”的作者高则诚，在一部分人当中，就被称为最伟大的“思想家”和“现实主义作家”，连他所宣扬的封建教条，也是属于人民的伦理道德的范畴；而在另一部分人当中，他却被贬为最反动的封建说教者，连他所深切同情、真实反映出来的有时代意义的社会悲剧，也一笔抹煞了。推而广之，做了南唐皇帝的词人李煜，不是爱国词人，就是封建皇帝；苏东坡因为曾经反对过王安石变法，于是文学史上也除了名，而伟大的诗人白居易，因为有许多深刻地暴露现实同情人民疾苦的诗篇，就否认他在“长恨歌”里对唐玄宗、杨贵妃的爱情流露过同情和歌颂。除此即彼，不可能有第三种现象。论者各执一端，振振有词。在争鸣的气氛里，还往往使人嗅到一种不正常的味道，那就是争鸣，似乎不是为了追求真理，不是为了实事求是地研究问题，而是争论双方都只为维护自己的观点，片面地搜寻论据，本来是一个非常复杂的问题，在这种争鸣中，却形成了两种简单化的极端：是就是是，否就是否，表面上针锋相对，骨子里是互不干涉，既不能解决问题，也不能使问题前进一步，彼此都死握着“量文的铁尺”，相持不下。作为一个古典文学的爱好者，在这种夹缝里，我不禁发生一点小小的怀疑：难道几百年甚至几千年前的作家和作品，就真能在这种“量文的铁尺”下完全地一个不漏地截然分开吗？！在我们的文学史里，确实就有许多这样的作家，既不能驱逐出境，也不能厕身于人民作家之林，他们的作品，就是呈现着复杂矛盾的现象，而作为文学遗产，却又是值得我们研究和接受的。一个严肃的批评家，是应该也必须还他们以历史的真面目。鲁迅有一句名言：“倘有取舍，即非全人，再加抑扬，更离真实”，却是值得“各执一端”的批评家们三思的。
    也许有人说我在拥护“中庸主义”，或者脱不掉被扣上一顶“观点模糊”的帽子，不过，我想，瞑目在九泉之下的古代作家，总也希望他的创作受到现代人的科学态度的“礼遇”，而不愿意在争鸣声中，一会儿被吹捧到虚无缥渺的云霄，一会儿被打进十八层地狱，一会儿受歌颂，一会儿受辱骂；而广大的普通读者，是更不愿意在这种莫衷一是的夹缝里讨生活的。如果这算是“中庸主义”或“观点模糊”，我却希望它也在争鸣声中，争得一席地位，使人们能看到一点历史和古人的真面目，免去死人和活人的许多灾难和苦恼。
