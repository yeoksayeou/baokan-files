Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, October 28th: Family sideline occupations of agricultural cooperative members in Guangxi Province are recovering and developing. According to statistics from Rongxian Special District and ten counties including Baise and Laibin in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, by the end of September, the number of pigs raised by the members increased by more than 100,000 compared to one or two months prior; Farmers in six counties including Baise raised more than 80,000 additional chickens and ducks. In September, farmers in thirteen counties including Tengxian and Yishan had a total income of more than 2 million yuan from family sideline occupations. The development of family sideline occupations by members of agricultural cooperatives in Guangxi Province is based on the criticism of various erroneous ideas obstructing the development of family sideline occupations by leaders, and the revision of comprehensive production plans and labor plans by agricultural cooperatives. While arranging for comprehensive production, agricultural cooperatives in various places have paid attention to arranging for the family sideline occupations of their members, and have promoted a system of holidays, a basic work-day system, and a system of contracting work to small groups (households) according to quotas, based on the busy and slack seasons of agricultural work, so that members have enough time to engage in family sideline activities while completing the cooperative's production plan. Agricultural cooperatives have also greatly increased the breeding of young livestock and poultry to supply to members for raising, and have appropriately adjusted the members' private plots to plant sweet potatoes, radishes and other feed crops.
In carrying out family sideline activities, members of agricultural cooperatives in various places first engage in sideline occupations that require little or no investment and produce quick results, such as collecting medicinal materials in the mountains, chopping firewood, and burning charcoal, and then use the income from these sideline occupations to operate sideline occupations with larger investments, such as pig raising. At present, the family sideline occupations of members of general agricultural cooperatives include one or twenty different kinds.

    广西农民家庭副业获得恢复和发展
    新华社南宁28日电　广西省各地农业社社员的家庭副业正在恢复和发展。据容县专区和桂西僮族自治州百色、来宾等十个县统计，到9月底止，社员们饲养的生猪比一两个月以前增加十多万头；百色等六个县农民增养的鸡、鸭有八万多只。藤县、宜山等十三个县农民在9月份一个月左右的时间中，家庭副业收入共达两百多万元。广西各地农业社社员的家庭副业，是在批判了领导上阻碍开展家庭副业的各种错误思想，农业社修订了全面发展生产规划和劳动规划的基础上开展起来的。各地农业社在安排全面生产的同时，都注意对社员家庭副业进行了安排，并且根据农事季节忙闲情况，推行了休假日制度，基本劳动日制和以小组（户）为单位按定额分段包工，使社员在完成社里生产计划的同时，还有足够的时间从事家庭副业活动。农业社还大量繁殖幼畜雏禽，供给社员饲养，并且适当地调整了社员的自留地，以种植红薯、萝卜等饲料作物。
    各地农业社社员在开展家庭副业活动中，都先搞投资少，甚至不需要投资，而且收效快的副业，如上山采集药材、砍柴、烧炭等，然后再用这些副业的收入经营投资较大的养猪等副业。现在，一般农业社的社员家庭副业都有一二十种。
