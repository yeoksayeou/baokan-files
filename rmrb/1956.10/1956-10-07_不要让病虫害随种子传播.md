Many plant diseases and insect pests often lurk inside the seeds of crops (including potato tubers), or adhere to their surface, spreading with the movement of seeds. Especially in the past year or two, farmers' enthusiasm for production has soared to unprecedented levels, and the urgent need for high-yielding seeds has led to an increasing number of introductions. Because various regions have not established or lack strict quarantine systems for the transfer of seeds, many dangerous plant diseases and insect pests have been given excellent opportunities to spread. For example, sweet potato black rot in Henan Province only occurred in thirty-four counties in 1954, but this year it has spread to more than ninety counties.

Is it impossible to avoid the spread of plant diseases and insect pests when introducing seeds? According to the experience of many regions, it can be avoided as long as effective measures are taken. For example, Anhui Province introduced more than 5 million catties of seed potatoes from Sichuan last year, and fumigated them with methyl bromide before shipment to kill all the larvae or pupae of the potato tuber moth lurking in the tubers. Another example is when Hunan, Hubei and other provinces introduced rice seeds from other places, in order to prevent the introduction of rice blast, they conscientiously disinfected them with formalin. These provinces completed the task of introducing seeds on time and effectively stopped the spread of many plant diseases and insect pests.

Due to the rapid development of agricultural production, coupled with the fact that some areas suffer from natural disasters every year, the task of introducing seeds will be further expanded in the future. It is hoped that all regions will notify the relevant departments of the quantity and types of seeds introduced as soon as possible so that quarantine inspections can be carried out to prevent the spread of plant diseases and insect pests and ensure the safe development of agricultural production.

    不要让病虫害随种子传播
    吕振甲
    有许多病虫害，常常潜伏在农作物的种子（包括薯块）的内部，或者附着在它的表面，随着种子的运转而传布。特别是近一两年来，农民生产积极性空前高涨，迫切需要丰产的种子，引种的数量日益增多。由于各地对调运种子没有建立或缺乏严格的检疫制度，给许多危险的病虫害造成了良好的传布机会。如河南省的甘薯黑斑病，1954年仅在三十四个县内发生，今年就蔓延到了九十多个县。
    在引种时是不是一定不能避免病虫害的传布呢？从不少地区的经验看，只要采取有效措施，是可以避免的。如安徽省去年从四川引进五百余万斤种用马铃薯，起运前就用溴代甲烷熏蒸，把潜伏在薯块内的块茎蛾的幼虫或蛹全部杀死。又如湖南、湖北等省由外地引进水稻种子时，为了防止稻热病的传入，切实地用福尔马林进行了消毒处理。这些省份按时完成了引种任务，并有效地制止了许多病虫害的传布。
    由于农业生产的迅速发展，加以每年都有一些地区遭受自然灾害，今后引种的任务将会更加扩大。希望各地将引进的种子的数量和种类及早通知各有关部门，以便进行检疫检查，制止病虫害的蔓延，保证农业生产的安全发展。
