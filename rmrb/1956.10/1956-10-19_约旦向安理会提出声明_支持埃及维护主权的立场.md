Xinhua News Agency, New York: Jordan submitted a written statement to the Security Council on the Suez issue on the 16th, stating: "Ensuring that the canal is politically insulated from any country must not be interpreted as a political term subjecting this indivisible part of Egypt (the canal zone) to all countries. Nor should it mean undermining Egypt's sovereignty."

The statement rigorously defends Egypt's right to reclaim the Suez Canal, pointing out that Egypt is willing to negotiate, while Britain, France, and other countries are attempting to enter the canal under the guise of so-called political insulation of the canal.

Seven Arab countries requested to participate in the Security Council's discussion on the Suez issue and were subsequently asked to submit their opinions in writing. In addition to Jordan, the countries that have already issued statements are Syria, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Yemen. They all support Egypt's position.

    约旦向安理会提出声明
    支持埃及维护主权的立场
    新华社讯　纽约消息：约旦16日向安全理事会提出了关于苏伊士问题的书面声明，声明说：“使运河同任何国家的政治绝缘这一点一定不可以被解释成这样一个政治述语：使埃及的这个不可分割的部分（运河区）受制于一切国家。这也不应该意味着损害埃及的主权。”
    声明严正地为埃及收回苏伊士运河的权利辩护，指出埃及愿意谈判，而英法等国却企图在所谓使运河同政治绝缘的幌子下进入运河。
    七个阿拉伯国家曾经要求参加安全理事会关于苏伊士问题的讨论，以后被请求用书面发表它们的意见。已经发表声明的除约旦以外还有：叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯、黎巴嫩和也门。它们都支持埃及的立场。
