Xinhua News Agency, October 19th, Southampton Dispatch: A group of British reservists who have been called up for service issued a statement on the 18th, demanding that the government allow them to return home as soon as possible to live a peaceful and stable life.

The statement said: "We fully understand that we cannot complain if we are called up in an emergency." However, the statement believes that the current call-up is intended to "invade Egypt," which "will not only lose us the oil in the Middle East that we want to keep, but also cause a third world war."

The statement calls on the press and public opinion to make the government abide by the law. It pointed out that United Nations resolutions are binding on all member states, and the use of force without the consent of the United Nations is aggression.

    不愿充当侵略埃及的炮灰
    英国一群后备兵要求回家
    据新华社19日讯　南安普顿消息：一群被征召服役的英国后备兵役人员18日发表声明，要求政府尽快地让他们回家过和平安定的生活。
    声明说：“我们完全懂得，如果我们是在紧急情况下被征召的话，我们是不能有什么埋怨的。”但是，声明认为：现在征召是为了想“侵略埃及”，而这“不但会失去我们想保持的中东的石油，而且会引起第三次世界大战”。
    声明要求报界和公众舆论让政府遵守法制。它指出，联合国的决议对所有会员国都是有约束力的，不经联合国的同意而使用武力就是侵略。
