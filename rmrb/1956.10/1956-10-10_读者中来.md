    Old Phenomena in the New Society

    This year, the Second Performance Team of the Chongqing Acrobatic Troupe toured western and southern Sichuan for eight months. They encountered strange and incomprehensible things every day. Here are just a few examples.

    When the troupe performed in Emei County, a responsible cadre came to watch the acrobatic performance. The following "play" unfolded at the entrance of the theater:

    Ticket Taker: "Comrade, your ticket?"
    Responsible Cadre: "It's with my orderly." (The orderly took out the ticket and gave it to the ticket taker.)
    Ticket Taker: "How come you two only have one ticket?"
    Responsible Cadre: "That's right, there's only one ticket!"
    "One ticket is only good for one person."
    "That won't do! I'm a leader, and he has to be here to protect me."
    "Then you should buy a ticket for your orderly."
    "My orderly's main job is to protect me. He doesn't have to watch the show, so of course, he doesn't need a ticket. How can you not let him in?"

    In January of this year, the troupe performed at the "Public Sichuan Opera Theater" in Neijiang. The newspapers and advertisements clearly stated "Children under one meter in height are not allowed to enter." However, a responsible cadre and his wife brought several children and wanted to enter.

    "Comrade, children under one meter are not allowed to watch the show."
    "Why?"
    "Because the air inside is not good enough. To protect the health of young children, major cities across the country are implementing this rule."
    "Don't give me that. The rules of Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing don't apply in Neijiang."

    When performing in other small and medium-sized cities, sometimes, two minutes before the show was scheduled to begin, there would be a sudden verbal notice: "Don't start the show yet. Our leader bought a ticket but hasn't arrived yet. He's still eating." Moreover, in Emei and Wutongqiao, there were three instances of the show being booked, the actors had put on their makeup, but when the time came, not a single audience member showed up, and no one followed up afterward.

    I think all of these can be collectively called "old phenomena in the new society!" Ye Yu

    新社会的旧现象
    重庆杂技艺术团第二演出队，今年上半年在四川西部和南部作了为时八个月的巡回演出，每天都要碰到一些奇奇怪怪和难以理解的事，这里只举其中之一二。
    该团在峨眉县演出时，有一个负责干部来看杂技表演，进剧场时，演了这样一出“戏”：
    验票员：“同志，票呢？”
    负责干部：“在我的通讯员身上。”（通讯员取出了票交给验票员）
    验票员：“你们两人怎么只有一张票？”
    负责干部：“是只有一张票嘛！”
    “一张票只能进去一个人。”
    “不行呀！我是首长，他得进去保卫我。”
    “那你应当给你的通讯员买一张票。”
    “我的通讯员主要是保卫我，他可以不看戏，不看戏当然就不买票，你们怎么能不准他进去呢？”
    今年一月该团在内江“大众川剧院”演出。报纸，广告上都写得很清楚“一公尺以下的儿童谢绝入场”，但是又有一位负责干部和他的爱人，带了几个孩子想进场。
    “同志，不满一公尺的孩子，不能入场看戏。”
    “为什么？”
    “因为场内空气不够好，为了照顾小孩子的身体健康，全国各大城市都在推行这个制度。”
    “别来那一套，北京、上海、重庆的规矩拿到内江来就吃不开。”
    在其他中小城市演出时，在开演的前两分钟有时会突然来个口头通知：“你们莫忙开演，我们首长买了票没有来，他还在吃饭。”甚至，在峨眉和五通桥，曾有三次包了场，演员化好了装，到时一个观众也不来，而且事后不闻不问。
    这些，我想统称之为“新社会的旧现象！”　叶语
