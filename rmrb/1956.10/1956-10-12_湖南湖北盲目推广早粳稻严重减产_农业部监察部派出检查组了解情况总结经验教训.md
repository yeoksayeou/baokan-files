    Hunan and Hubei Blindly Promote Early Japonica Rice, Resulting in Severe Yield Reduction
    Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Supervision Dispatch Inspection Teams to Understand the Situation and Summarize Lessons Learned
    (Our Newspaper) News: Inspection teams from the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Supervision have successively gone to Hunan and Hubei provinces to understand the situation of severe yield reduction caused by the blind promotion of early Japonica rice, and to summarize experiences and lessons in order to improve the leadership of agricultural technology reform in the future.
    The inspection team that went to Hunan visited Changde, Taoyuan, Hanshou, Nanxian, Leiyang, Qidong, Hengnan, Xiangtan, Hengyang and other counties and cities, as well as eighteen agricultural production cooperatives in these areas, to conduct investigations. Through on-site inspections, they learned that Hunan Province promoted 3,013,000 jin of "Aomori No. 5" early Japonica rice seeds this year, with a total planting area of ​​more than 215,900 mu. With the exception of a few that grew well and had normal yields, the vast majority of these early Japonica rice crops experienced poor growth and development, premature heading, and very low yields. In most areas, the yield of early Japonica rice was reduced by more than 50% compared to early Indica rice. It is estimated that the province has reduced production by more than 40 million jin. Farmers in areas where early Japonica rice was planted were very dissatisfied with the blind large-scale promotion without prior experimentation, which resulted in reduced yields and losses.
    The inspection team that went to Hubei is currently working in the three special districts of Huanggang, Xiaogan, and Jingzhou. According to the preliminary report of this inspection team: Hubei promoted more than 55 million jin of Japonica rice seeds this year, with a planting area of ​​approximately 3.5 million mu. Judging from the current situation, yields are generally reduced. According to a preliminary investigation in Hubei Province, the average yield per mu of 530,000 mu of early Japonica rice ("Aomori No. 5") was 314 jin, a decrease of 28.6% compared to early Indica rice; the average yield per mu of 1.5 million mu of medium Japonica rice ("Yinfang") was 382 jin, a decrease of 22.2% compared to medium Indica rice; the total reduction in rice production for the two types is approximately more than 200 million jin.
    Although individual areas of Hubei Province have grown Japonica rice, the number is extremely small, and most of it is concentrated in the suburbs of Wuhan. Last year, the province's trial planting of Japonica rice was only more than 7,500 mu, but this year's promotion reached more than 3 million mu.
    Many farmers in Hubei Province call the yield reduction of Japonica rice a "Japonica disaster." They said that this year is a bumper harvest year in Hubei, and the yields of general crops are higher than in previous years, but the yield of Japonica rice is too low.
    The inspection proved that the basic reasons for the serious losses caused by the promotion of early Japonica in these two provinces were: the blind and impetuous mood in promoting agricultural technology reform, the subjectivism in the leadership's thinking, and the coercive command style in the work, which led to blind large-scale promotion without experiments or only after local small-scale experiments. The inspection work in Hunan started earlier, and the local authorities are now handling the aftermath in conjunction with inspecting the leadership's ideology and work style; the inspection work in Hubei is still in progress.

    湖南湖北盲目推广早粳稻严重减产
    农业部监察部派出检查组了解情况总结经验教训
    本报讯　农业部、监察部的检查组先后到湖南、湖北两省了解盲目推广早粳稻造成严重减产的情况，总结经验教训，以改进今后农业技术改革的领导工作。
    去湖南的检查组先后曾到常德、桃源、汉寿、南县、耒阳、祁东、衡南、湘潭、衡阳等县市和这些地区的十八个农业生产合作社进行调查。在实地检查中了解：湖南省今年推广的“青森五号”早粳稻种子三百零一万三千斤，播种面积共二十一万五千九百多亩。这些早粳稻除个别的生长较好，产量正常外，绝大部分都是生长发育不好、抽穗过早、产量很低。多数地区的早粳稻比早籼稻减产50％以上。全省约计减产四千万斤以上。种植早粳稻地区的农民对这种不经试验就盲目大量推广，因而招致减产损失很不满意。
    去湖北的检查组现在正在黄冈、孝感、荆州三个专区进行工作。据这个检查组的初步汇报：湖北今年推广的粳稻种子五千五百多万斤，播种面积约三百五十万亩，就目前情况看，一般也是减产的。根据湖北省的初步调查，五十三万亩早粳（“青森五号”）平均亩产三百一十四斤，比早籼稻减产28.6％；一百五十万亩中粳稻（“银坊”）平均亩产三百八十二斤，比中籼稻减产22.2％；两种共减产稻谷约两亿多斤。
    湖北省个别地区虽种过粳稻，但是为数极少，而且大部集中在武昌市郊。去年这个省试种的粳稻只有七千五百多亩，今年推广的竟多到三百万亩以上。
    湖北省的许多农民把粳稻减产称做“粳灾”。他们说，今年湖北是个丰收年成，一般农作物的产量都比往年高，就是粳稻的产量太低了。
    经检查证明，这两省推广早粳造成严重损失的基本原因是：推行农业技术改革中的盲目急躁情绪、领导思想上的主观主义和工作中的强迫命令作风，以致不经试验或只经局部小片的试验，即盲目大面积推广。对湖南的检查工作开始较早，当地现正结合检查领导思想作风处理善后事宜；湖北的检查工作正在进行中。
