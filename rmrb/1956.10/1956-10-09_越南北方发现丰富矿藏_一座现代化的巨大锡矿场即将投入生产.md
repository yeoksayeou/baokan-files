    (News from Hanoi via "Voice of Vietnam" Radio): After more than a year of exploration, rich mineral deposits have been discovered in the Star Lodge (Xingxiu) area of Cao Bằng province, Northern Vietnam. This mining area not only has abundant tin resources, but also contains gold, tungsten, uranium, iron and other minerals. In an area two kilometers long and half a kilometer wide, tin can be found on the surface. The tin mining area covers an area of ​​150 square kilometers. The gold mining area also covers tens of kilometers. The rich underground resources of this mining area will play a huge role in the development of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's industry.

    In order to mine the tin ore here, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, with the assistance of the Soviet Union, began building a huge mine in the Star Lodge area a year ago. It is the largest of the twenty-five enterprises built by the Soviet Union to aid Vietnam. This mine has now been fully completed and will be put into production within a few days. The mine has been equipped with modern machinery and equipment shipped from the Soviet Union. All the equipment is state-of-the-art.

    越南北方发现丰富矿藏
    一座现代化的巨大锡矿场即将投入生产
    本报讯　据“越南之声”广播电台河内消息：经过一年多的勘探结果，越南北方高平省的星宿地区已经发现了丰富的矿藏。这个矿区不仅富有锡矿资源，而且蕴藏有金、钨、铀、铁等矿产。在一个两公里长、半公里宽的地区，人们能够在地面上找到锡。锡矿矿区面积达到一百五十平方公里。金矿区的面积也有几十公里。这个矿区的丰富的地下资源，对于越南民主共和国工业的发展将能够起极大的作用。
    为了开采这里的锡矿，越南民主共和国在苏联的援助下，一年前在星宿地区便开始建设一座巨大的矿场。它是苏联援助越南建设的二十五项企业中最大的一项。这个矿场现在已经全部建成，即将于数日内开工生产。矿场内已经装备好苏联运来的现代化的机器和设备。全部设备都是最新式的。
