    The Trading of Goods in Henan Province's Rural Markets
    Nan Cai
    Editor's Note: After the relaxation of rural market management in many regions across the country, markets have generally shown increased activity. However, how to better organize farmer trade, stabilize market prices, and prevent blind spots in farmer trade are problems that need to be addressed currently. The restoration and establishment of trade organizations in Henan Province's rural markets provide a good specific method for solving the above problems, and we hope that various localities will pay attention to studying them.

    Following the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives' instruction to "develop consignment sales and organize farmer trade," the Henan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, starting in early June, successively organized trade organizations in fruit-producing areas, leveraging the role of farmer trade and small merchants. According to incomplete statistics, more than 150 trade organizations and exchanges have already been restored and established throughout the province. In addition, many other regions are currently preparing and piloting them. Facts have proven that organizing trade organizations plays a certain role in supporting farmer trade and revitalizing the market.

    The forms of organizing trade organizations in various places generally fall into two categories: trade shops and exchanges. The main business of trade shops is to buy goods on behalf of customers, consign goods for sale, and extensively connect with agricultural cooperatives and small merchants to conduct purchasing and sales in an organized manner. Exchanges mainly organize transactions between farmers and small merchants on a daily basis. According to feedback from various places, the benefits of organizing trade organizations are roughly as follows:

    First, trade organizations are convenient for both buyers and sellers, and the service is attentive. When farmers sell agricultural and sideline products, they only need to send the products to the trade shop or exchange, without having to exert themselves to sell them. When selling products, all organization of sales channels, weighing, settlement, payment, tax payment, etc., are handled by the trade shop; some trade shops also purchase unsold goods on the same day; some trade shops also solve difficulties such as accommodation and meals for customers. Farmers are also satisfied with the selling price. Small merchants can choose and purchase goods at will in the trade shop. Moreover, the procedures are very simple, so they do not have to worry about not being able to buy goods and can reduce travel. Therefore, farmers and small merchants are very willing to enter the trade. For example, Lin County in Anyang Prefecture produces a variety of fruits, and the output is also large. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation in the mountainous areas, small vendors in the towns could not go up the mountains, and many mountain products were rotten due to the inability to sell them, causing great losses. In this case, the Xixiangping grassroots cooperative in the county established a "Fruit Exchange" in a suitable location (i.e., Beixiguan Village under Lubanhe, where the masses and small merchants can return on the same day after buying and selling). The average number of people trading every day is around 100, and the daily turnover of only flowering crabapples reaches 5,000 to 7,000 catties. Later, this area became a new trading market. After the Xiaoyi Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Gong County established a dried and fresh fruit trade shop, it organized the transaction of more than 30,000 catties of goods such as vegetables, persimmons, dates, and chickens in 15 days. Under the driving force of the trade shop, the amount of various products on the market has also increased day by day. In the past, there were only about a dozen kinds of vegetables and fresh fruits on the market, about 1,500 catties, but now it has increased to more than 25 kinds, more than 12,000 catties. It has played a great role in ensuring market supply.

    Because trade organizations connect farmer trade on the one hand and small merchants on the other, some purchasing and sales activities in the market are carried out under the organization of trade shops or exchanges, so they have a stabilizing effect on the market. For example, before the organization of trade shops in Xinzheng County, there was a phenomenon that agricultural cooperatives sold large amounts of jujubes to distant places. However, after the county's supply and marketing cooperative organized trade organizations, on the one hand, it organized small merchants to purchase goods relying on trade shops (and also purchased on behalf of the supply and marketing cooperative), and on the other hand, it widely publicized the entry of trade organizations to agricultural cooperatives. The average daily trading volume of a trade shop reached more than 3,900 catties, small merchants no longer went to agricultural cooperatives to purchase goods indiscriminately, and the phenomenon of agricultural cooperatives transporting large amounts of jujubes to other places was greatly reduced.

    The restoration and establishment of trade shops in many areas of Henan Province has undergone a detailed and complex organizational work. The specific methods of Zhongmu County and Yuanyang County are: first, to educate the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives to clarify the significant role of establishing and restoring trade organizations in revitalizing the rural economy, and to explain that the trade organizations under the leadership of the socialist market are different in nature from the old brokers. Secondly, to deeply understand the market situation and the foundation of the old trade shops, to formulate specific plans, and to conduct detailed research on specific issues such as which personnel to absorb and organize, where to establish, when to establish, and the organizational form and business scope of the trade organizations, and to formulate methods. Then, to adopt individual visits and meeting forms to understand the ideological situation of the organizational objects, implement policies, and solve the ideological concerns of these people, such as some fearing that the trade organization industry will not last long; some fearing that the business is small and not profitable; some fearing that although they earn a lot of money, most of it will go to the public accumulation fund, and they will not get anything... etc. On the basis of resolving ideological concerns and mature brewing, the staff of the trade organizations were further educated on new commercial ethics and service attitudes. Finally, in terms of actively preparing to organize business and opening on time, in addition to the specific help of the supply and marketing cooperative in finding houses, repairing facades, borrowing furniture, and other preparatory work, it is also necessary to do a good job in publicity and business coordination. Before opening, methods such as posting advertisements, broadcasting, and blackboards should be adopted to vigorously publicize, explain the significance of the trade shop to the masses, the opening time, location, what business it is engaged in, and business procedures, so that the trade shop has something to do when it opens, in order to improve the business enthusiasm of the traders, and to demonstrate to the farmers.

    河南省农村市场的行栈交易
    南采
    编者按　全国不少地区在放宽农村市场管理以后，市场普遍呈现活跃。但如何更好地对农民贸易加以组织，稳定市场价格和防止农民贸易中的盲目性，是当前需要注意解决的问题。河南省农村市场恢复与建立行栈交易，为解决上述问题提供了一个较好的具体办法，希望各地注意研究。
    全国供销合作总社提出“开展代销业务、组织农民贸易”的指示后，河南省供销合作社自6月初，相继在水果产区组织行栈交易，发挥了农民贸易和小商贩的作用。根据不完全的统计，目前全省已经恢复和建立了一百五十多个行店和交易所，此外，还有不少地区目前正在筹备和试办。事实证明，组织行栈交易，对扶持农民贸易，活跃市场，起着一定的作用。
    各地组织行栈交易的形式，一般有两种。一种是行店，一种是交易所。行店的主要业务是代客买货，寄买寄卖，并广泛联系农业社及小商贩，有组织地进行购销。交易所主要是组织当天农民贸易和小商贩的交易。根据各地反映，组织行栈交易的好处大体上有以下几方面。
    首先，行栈交易对买卖双方都很便利，服务又周到。农民出售土副产品时，只要把产品送到行店或交易所，不用自己费力即可卖出去。出售产品时，所有组织联系销路、过磅、结算、付款、纳税等，都由行店代办；当天出售不完的商品，有的行店还进行收购；有的行店还为顾客解决住宿、吃饭等困难。在出售价上农民也满意。小商贩在行店进货，可以随意选购。而且手续也很简便，既不用担心买不到货，又可减少跑路。因此，农民群众、小商贩都很乐意入行交易。如安阳专区的林县，出产各种水果，而且产量也较大，已往因山区交通不便，城镇小贩不能上山，许多山货因为不能推销而烂掉，造成很大损失。在这种情况下，该县西乡坪基层社，在适中地点（即群众和小商贩买卖后当天能返回）——鲁班壑下北西关村，建立了“水果交易所”，每天进行交易的人平均在一百人左右，每天成交量仅花红一项即达五千到七千斤。以后，这个地区竟成了一个新的交易市场。巩县孝义供销社建立了干鲜果行店后，在十五天当中组织成交的货物有蔬菜、柿子、枣、鸡等三万多斤。在行店的带动下，各种产品上市量也日益增加，已往上市的蔬菜、鲜果等不过十多种，约一千五百斤左右，现在增加到二十五种，一万二千多斤以上。对保证市场供应起了很大作用。
    由于行栈交易一方面联系了农民贸易，一方面又联系着小商贩，市场上的部分购销活动，在行店或交易所的组织下进行，所以有稳定市场的作用。例如新郑县在组织行店以前曾出现农业社纷纷大量远销大枣现象，但当该县供销社组织行店交易后，一方面组织小商贩依靠行店进货（也给供销社代购），另方面广泛向农业社宣传入行交易，一个行店平均每日交易量达三千九百多斤，小商贩不再到农业社去乱购，农业社大量外运大枣的现象也大为减少。
    河南省不少地区行店的恢复和建立，是经过了一番细致而复杂的组织工作的。中牟县和原阳县的具体作法是，首先在供销社干部中进行教育，明确建立与恢复行栈在活跃农村经济等方面的重大作用，说明在社会主义市场领导下的行栈，在性质上已经不同于旧的牙行。其次，深入了解市场情况和旧有行店的基础，拟定具体方案，对吸收和组织哪些人员参加，在什么地方建立，什么时候建立，以及行栈的组织形式，业务范围等具体问题，都作详细研究，制定出办法。然后，采取个别访问和会议形式了解组织对象的思想情况，贯彻政策，解决这些人的思想顾虑，例如有的怕行栈业不长远；有的怕业务小，不赚钱；有的怕赚钱虽多，大部归公积金，而自己得不到……等。在解决思想顾虑，酝酿成熟的基础上，进一步对行栈工作人员进行了新的商业道德和服务态度的教育，最后，在积极准备组织业务、按时开业方面，除供销社具体帮助找房子、修整门面、借家具等筹备工作外，还必须做好宣传和业务串连工作，在开业前要采取贴广告、广播、黑板报等办法，大力进行宣传，向群众讲明行店的意义、开业时间、地点、经营什么业务以及业务手续等，使行店在开业时就有事情可做，以提高交易员的经营积极性，并向农民进行示范。
