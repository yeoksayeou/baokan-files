　　The East is Red All Over the World
　　Huang Yingpei
    Dedicated to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China on the eve of the National Day of the People's Republic of China in September 1956
          (The first eight rhymes were completed before the opening, and many thoughts accumulated in the assembly hall, enough to make fourteen rhymes)
    Marxist-Leninist doctrines are widely spread
    The Party has been established for thirty-five springs
    The three major enemies are all wiped out
    One battle line lasts forever
    Personally come and go, I follow the masses
      (From the masses, to the masses)
    Skillfully applying leniency and severity to teach instead of punishing
      (Leniency in certain situations, severity in others)
    One hundred and sixty articles hang the people's constitution
    Five principles brew world peace
    Worker-peasant alliance is good
    Society welcomes the new socialism
    Once "Resist" and "Aid" established credibility
    The Five-Year Plan has begun to lay the foundation
    Learn from failures and gain experience
    Early warning to all heroes, do not worship individuals
    Learning must be repeated
    Criticism is more important than self-criticism
    Re-implement education to promote democracy
    Forever preserve the strong People's Liberation Army
    Correctness must be viewed comprehensively
    Strive to let a hundred schools of thought contend
    Guests come from afar in Central and South America
    Agree to adhere to anti-colonialism
    Everything is open to the whole world
    Two weeks of grand celebrations in Beijing
    National Day at Tiananmen Square meets a happy festival
    Thousands of mountains and rivers recall the bitterness
    My visit to Yan'an is like a dream yesterday
    "The East is Red" has spread all over the world
　　　　(Visited Chairman Mao in Yan'an in 1945, just as the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China closed)

　　东方红遍环瀛
　　黄英培
    1956年9月中华人民共和国国庆节前夕献给中国共产党第八次全国代表大会
          （开幕前先成八韵在大会场积了不少感想足成十四韵）
    马恩学说广传人
    建党于今卅五春
    三大敌人齐扑灭
    一条战线共长存
    身亲来去吾从众
      （从群众中来，到群众中去）
    妙运宽严教代刑
      （某种情况从宽某种从严）
    百六条悬民宪法
    五原则酿世和平
    工农认识联盟好
    社会欢迎主义新
    一度“抗”“援”威信立
    五年计划始基成
    翻从失败多经验
    早戒群英拜个人
    学习必须再学习
    批评更重自批评
    重施教育扬民主
    永保精强解放军
    正确要从全面看
    争先尽让百家鸣
    来宾远自中南美
    同意坚持反殖民
    一切公开全世界
    两周盛会北京城
    天安国庆逢佳节
    万水千山忆苦辛
    我去延安如昨梦
    “东方红”已遍环瀛
　　　　（1945年延安谒毛主席恰值中国共产党第七次全国代表大会闭幕）
