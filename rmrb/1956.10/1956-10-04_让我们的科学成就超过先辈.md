    Let Our Scientific Achievements Surpass Our Predecessors
    Xiao Kuntao
    At a symposium for soliciting opinions on the Academy of Sciences' plan, the topic of greatest interest was when textbooks would be published. Undeniably, as teachers, it is only natural to be concerned about textbooks. However, the sacred, authoritative position of textbooks among general teachers reflects a serious problem. It seems to make people feel that textbooks are the absolute truth of a given science, and with them, teachers can save themselves trouble. Having a book as proof in everything can largely avoid the suspicion of "distorting Marxism" or "creating novelty and sensationalizing to impress the public." The sacred concepts and legal status of textbooks and teaching syllabi make teachers feel as if they are facing an abyss and treading on thin ice when teaching. How can they still think independently and express their own opinions freely? We welcome the publication of textbooks with high scientific value, and we welcome the promulgation of various teaching syllabi with reference value, but please do not give them the dignity of law. They should be close friends of teachers in their teaching and scientific research, rather than strict superiors.
    The practice of "approval" is also extremely prevalent in schools. Heads of teaching and research groups have become "chiefs" at all levels. Teachers' personal plans must be approved by them, teaching plans must be approved by them, the purpose, requirements, and discussion questions of classroom discussions must be approved by them, and exam papers must be approved by them... In a word, administrative style runs through the leadership of teaching business. What are the consequences of such leadership? It dampens teachers' initiative, damages the self-esteem that a scientist should have in his independent teaching and research activities, and breeds bureaucracy and formalism in the leadership of teaching. The teaching and research group was originally a good organizational form for promoting collective wisdom, but once it is stained with the dust of bureaucracy, it becomes a rope that restrains teachers.
    Currently, all parties are paying close attention to improving the working and living conditions of intellectuals, but more attention is being paid to material life aspects, and not enough attention is being paid to the problems existing in the teaching and research process and spiritual life. Teachers and scientists need great ideological liberation, and they need reasonable freedom in teaching and research. Only in this way can universities fulfill their mission of the times; only then can scientific giants like Servetus, Bruno, Copernicus, and Newton emerge from the ranks of teachers and scientists, from their thousands upon thousands of young students. Moreover, it is entirely believable that, because of the unparalleled greatness of our era, their scientific achievements will far surpass those of their predecessors.

    让我们的科学成就超过先辈
    萧焜焘
    在一个关于科学院规划征询意见的座谈会上，大家最感兴趣的是教科书何日出版。不容否认，作为教师，关心教科书是理所当然的。但是教科书在一般教师之中的神圣的权威的地位，却反映出严重的问题。仿佛使人觉得，教科书是该门科学的绝对真理集成，有了它，教师们就省事了。凡事有书为证，庶几可免“歪曲马克思主义”、“标新立异、哗众取宠”之嫌。对于教科书、教学大纲之类的神圣观念及法律地位，使得教师进行教学时，如临深渊，如履薄冰，那还能独立思考，各抒己见？我们欢迎有高度科学价值的教科书出版，欢迎各种有参考价值的教学大纲颁发，但请不要赋予它们以法律的尊严，应当使它们成为教师们教学和科学研究的亲密朋友，而不要成为教师们的严峻上司。
    学校里“批准”之风也极为盛行。教研组主任成了一级“首长”，教师的个人规划要他批准，教学计划要他批准，课堂讨论的目的、要求、讨论题要他批准，考签要他批准……，一句话，行政作风贯串在教学业务领导中。如此领导的后果如何呢？挫伤了教师的主动性，损害了一个科学家在其独立的教学和研究活动中应有的自尊心，滋长了教学领导中的官僚主义、形式主义的作风。教研组原是发扬集体智慧的良好组织形式，但一染上了官僚主义的灰尘，就变成了约束教师的绳索了。
    目前，各个方面已十分注意改善知识分子工作和生活的条件，但偏于物质生活方面的多，对教学研究过程及精神生活方面存在的问题还注意得不够。教师们、科学家们需要思想上的大解放，需要教学和研究上合理的自由。只有这样，大学才能担负起它的时代使命；才能从教师及科学家队伍中，从他们千千万万的青年门生中，产生塞尔维、布鲁诺、哥白尼、牛顿这样的科学巨人。而且完全可以相信，由于我们所处的时代伟大无比，他们的科学成就也将远远超过他们的先辈。
