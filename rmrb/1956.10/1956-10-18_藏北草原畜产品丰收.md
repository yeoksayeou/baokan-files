Xinhua News Agency report: According to estimates from the Heihe Branch of the Tibet Trade General Company, this year the herdsmen in the Heihe region of eastern Northern Tibet can sell nearly two million catties of wool and fifty thousand catties of butter to the state. After overcoming the drought and disease that occurred at one point, Northern Tibet's grasslands still achieved a bumper harvest of livestock products this year.

Currently, thousands of large yak herds and sheep flocks, along with many goats and horses, are grazing on the vast grasslands. The calves born in June have grown to weigh over a hundred catties, and the lambs also have glossy fur. On the grasslands, one can constantly see yak herds laden with livestock products such as wool, butter, and hides heading towards Heihe and the trade groups set up in other parts of the Northern Tibet grasslands.

This year, a drought occurred in the Northern Tibet grasslands, followed by an epidemic. The herdsmen all said that if they had encountered such a year before liberation, large numbers of cattle and sheep would have died. Now, the ability of the people in the Northern Tibet pastoral areas to overcome natural disasters has greatly increased. The Heihe Sub-Committee of the CCP Tibet Working Committee issued a large number of interest-free livestock loans. Automobiles also promptly delivered veterinary epidemic prevention personnel, who helped the herdsmen to eradicate the prevalent livestock epidemics.

    藏北草原畜产品丰收
    据新华社讯　据西藏贸易总公司黑河分公司预计，今年藏北草原东部黑河地区的牧民可以卖给国家将近两百万斤羊毛和五万斤酥油。在战胜了一度发生的干旱和病疫以后，今年藏北草原的畜产品仍然获得了丰收。
    目前，数以千百计的大牦牛群和绵羊群，还有许多山羊和马匹，正放牧在辽阔的草原上。今年6月里产下的小牛犊有的已经长到一百斤重，小羊羔也长得毛泽光滑。在草原上，不断可以看见驮着羊毛、酥油和皮张等畜产品的牦牛群向黑河和分设在藏北草原其他地方的贸易小组进发。
    今年，藏北草原曾发生干旱，接着疫病又流行起来。牧民都说：要是在解放以前，碰上了这样的年成，牛羊会大批死亡。现在藏北牧区人民战胜自然灾害的力量已大大增强了。中共西藏工委黑河分工委曾发放了大量的无利牧业贷款。汽车又及时送来了兽疫防治人员，他们帮助牧民扑灭了流行性畜疫。
