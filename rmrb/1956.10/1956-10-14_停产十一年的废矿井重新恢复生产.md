Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 12th. The Ashegou Inclined Shaft of the Longfeng Mine, which had been out of production for eleven years, resumed production on October 6th. Under normal production conditions, this coal mine can produce 150,000 tons of coking coal annually.

This inclined shaft had been badly damaged by Japanese imperialist exploitation. In the early days of liberation, the entire mine was flooded. The people who repaired this mine drained the water, extinguished the fire zones, and repaired and excavated thousands of meters of roadways under the threat of water, fire, and gas. Now, this mine is fully equipped with drainage, transportation, and ventilation equipment. The mine entrance has a special emergency warehouse for handling fire zones and gas, and there are two floodgates in the roadways to prevent flooding.

    停产十一年的废矿井重新恢复生产
    新华社抚顺12日电　停产十一年的龙凤矿阿舍沟斜井，在10月6日重新恢复生产。这座煤井在正常的生产情况下，每年可以生产出十五万吨炼焦煤。
    这座斜井曾被日本帝国主义者开采得破烂不堪。解放初期，整个矿井被水淹没。修复这个矿井的人们，排除了井下积水，扑灭了火区，在水、火、瓦斯的威胁下，修复和开掘了上千公尺的巷道。现在，在这座矿井下面，排水、运输、通风等设备都很齐全；坑口设有专门处理火区、瓦斯的非常仓库，在巷道中还装有两道预防水患的防水闸。
