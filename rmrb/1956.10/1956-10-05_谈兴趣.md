　　Interest is an important driving force for a person to acquire knowledge, broaden their horizons, and enrich their spiritual life. A person who lacks interest or has narrow interests will find their life becomes dull and empty.

　　In Gogol's novel "The Overcoat," the protagonist, Akaky Akakievich, has only one interest: the interest in copying documents. "In copying, he found his own diverse and comfortable world." After work, "for his own satisfaction," he devoted all his spare time to copying documents. "After he had copied enough, when he went to sleep, he smiled slightly in anticipation, thinking about what God would send him to write the next day."

　　This is one type of person.

　　The Russian General Suvorov, in his youth, was very interested in military affairs. He read all the books on military history and military technology that he could understand. He spent most of his time studying tactical problems. He exercised his body and never gave up any opportunity to absorb any military professional knowledge. However, he was interested in all knowledge, and even when he was old, he always used all his spare time to read and study. Therefore, he became one of the most learned people of his time. He was proficient in mathematics, geography, philosophy, and history, and he also made time to study languages. He was fluent in German, French, Italian, Polish, Finnish, Turkish, Arabic, and Persian. Literature occupied an even more important position in his range of interests. He not only often read the works of the best writers and carefully studied the literature popular at the time, but he also wrote poetry himself.

　　This is another type of person.

　　These two types of people remind me of the recent reports in newspapers and periodicals exposing the problem of schools neglecting the cultivation and development of students' interests and special skills, and even restricting students' individuality, when implementing the policy of comprehensive development of personality. This problem is indeed a principled defect existing in current educational work. If this continues, students will not dare to talk about their interests, and students with different hobbies and interests will be ridiculed as "aiming too high," "individualistic," "detached from the masses," and "hindering collective honor"... As a result, they spend all day circling around textbooks and homework, passively accepting knowledge, lacking independent thinking ability, and being neither lively nor cheerful.

　　So, do we want to cultivate Akaky Akakievich-type people, or Suvorov-type people? If we only cultivate one solitary interest in a young student, and do not love the rich and colorful content of the whole life, like Akaky Akakievich, then it will be impossible to make the student's personality develop normally and healthily.

　　The perfect development of a person's personality is based on a great breadth of interest as a prerequisite. Throughout history, the astonishingly profound knowledge of many outstanding figures is related to the breadth of their interests. When Marx's daughters asked him to tell them his favorite motto, he wrote the ancient Latin motto: "Nothing human is alien to me." Gorky once said: "A novice writer once sent me a letter, saying: 'I don't need to know everything at all.'" Gorky believed: "This writer cannot write anything of value."

　　A person who, while still in adolescence, defines an extremely narrow range of interests and hobbies for himself cannot, according to Gorky's view, achieve any great achievements. A person should be educated to feel interested in everything, or at least should feel interested in many things, but can be particularly interested in one aspect. Broad interest does not exclude the main, central interest.

    谈兴趣
    李传信
    兴趣是一个人获得知识，开拓眼界，以及丰富他的精神生活的一种重要动力。缺乏兴趣或兴趣狭窄的人，就会使得他的生活变成枯燥、空洞。
    果戈理的小说“外套”中的主人公阿加克·阿加维琪，只有一种兴趣，就是抄写文书的兴趣。“在抄写中，他发现他自己的一个五花八门而且很舒畅的世界”。下班回来，他“为了自己的满足”，就把所有的空闲时间都用于抄文书。“他抄写够了以后，睡觉时，当想到第二天上帝会派他写什么东西的话，就预先微微地笑了”。
    这是一种人。
    俄罗斯将军苏沃洛夫，他在少年时代，就对军事很有兴趣。他阅读一切他所能看懂的军事历史与军事技术的书籍。他用大部分时间研究战术问题。他锻炼自己的身体，从不放弃汲取任何军事专业知识的机会。但是，他对于任何知识都发生兴趣，一直到老，他总是利用全部空闲时间读书、学习。因此，他成为当时最有学问的人士之一。他通晓数学、地理、哲学、历史，他还腾出了许多时间去研究语言。他精通德语、法语、意大利语、波兰语、芬兰语、土耳其语、阿拉伯语和波斯语。文艺在他的兴趣范围中更占有很重要的地位。他不只经常阅读最优秀的作家们的作品和细心研究当时所流行的文学，而且他自己也写诗。
    这又是一种人。
    这两种人的影子使我想起最近报刊上揭露学校中执行个性全面发展教育方针时忽视了培养和发展学生的兴趣、特长，甚至束缚学生个性的问题。这个问题确是目前教育工作中存在着的带有原则性的缺陷。如果长此以往，学生不敢谈自己的兴趣，有不同爱好和兴趣的学生，被讥讽为“好高骛远”，“个人主义”，“脱离群众”，“妨碍集体荣誉”……于是，整天只在课本、作业中转圈子，被动地接受知识，缺乏独立思想能力，不活泼，不开朗。
    那么要培养阿加克·阿加维琪式的人，还是培养苏沃洛夫式的人呢？假若对一个青少年学生，只培养他一种孤独的兴趣，对整个生活中丰富多采的内容不热爱，像阿加克·阿加维琪那样。那么，要想使学生的个性正常而健康地发展，那是办不到的。
    一个人的个性的完美发展，是以很大的兴趣广度为前提的。古往今来，许多卓越的人物的令人惊愕的渊博知识是同他们的兴趣的广度有关系的。当马克思的女儿们请求他说出他所爱好的格言时，他就写出古拉丁格言：“人类的一切东西，对我都不是陌生的。”高尔基曾说：“一个初学写作的作家曾给我封信，说：我完全不需要知道一切。”高尔基认为：“这个作家是写不出任何有价值的东西的”。
    一个还在青少年时代的人，就给自己划定了极其狭窄的兴趣和爱好的范围，依照高尔基的见解，是不能达到任何伟大的成就的。应当教育一个人对于一切事情感觉兴趣，最低限度也应对于许多事情感觉兴趣，但可以对某一方面特别感觉兴趣。兴趣广泛并不排斥主要的，中心的兴趣。
