Xinhua News Agency, London, 2nd—Fifteen out of the eighteen countries participating in the London conference joined the "Suez Canal Users Association," which was formally established here yesterday. However, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands require formal approval from their respective parliaments to officially participate.

Pakistan, Ethiopia, and Japan did not join the "Association." Their representatives attended the meeting as observers.

At the October 1st meeting, three committees of the "Association" were established. The first committee will handle matters related to organizing the council and executive bodies, appointing administrators, and determining the scope of authority and interrelationships of these institutions and individuals.

The second is a management committee composed of shipping experts, which is said to handle practical issues related to canal management, including canal fees. Both committees began work on the afternoon of October 1st.

The third is the finance committee, which will handle the finances of the "Suez Canal Users Association," and began work on the 2nd.

All members, associate members, and observers can participate in these three committees. A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the entire process of the meeting was "completely secret." He also said he did not know whether a plenary session would be held on October 2nd.
