Our Anger, Our Protest!
The British Authorities Must Be Held Responsible for the Kowloon Incident!
To the Editor:

    We express our utmost indignation at the heinous riots perpetrated by Kuomintang special agents in the Kowloon area, and extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to our compatriots who have suffered in Kowloon.

    Strangely, this area is under the jurisdiction of the British authorities in Hong Kong. The British authorities were able to tolerate the evil riots of the thugs for so long, without any prior prevention, and without effective suppression after the riots broke out. We believe this is inseparable from the consistent connivance of the Hong Kong British authorities towards the criminal activities of the Kuomintang elements. We clearly remember that on April 11, 1955, the "Kashmir Princess" plane was sabotaged and blown up by Kuomintang special agents. The Hong Kong British authorities not only did not arrest and bring the chief culprits to justice, but also released all the relevant individuals who had been arrested. Similarly, this incident would not have happened without the connivance of the Hong Kong British authorities.

    We strongly protest against this attitude of the Hong Kong British authorities, demanding that the Hong Kong British authorities resolutely stop the Kuomintang special agents' atrocities, arrest all the criminals and punish them severely, and guarantee that Kuomintang special agents will no longer be allowed to use the Hong Kong and Kowloon areas to carry out criminal activities against our country. The Chinese people have every right to make such a demand. We are closely following the development of the situation and vow to support our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon with practical actions.

I Protest in the Name of a Teacher
To the Editor:

    Today, after seeing the news in the newspaper about the major riots created by Kuomintang special agents in Kowloon, I feel boundless anger at the heinous crimes of the Kuomintang special agents! At the same time, I express extreme dissatisfaction with the attitude taken by the Hong Kong British authorities towards the riots.

    The Hong Kong British authorities, without any need for explanation, bear the responsibility of ensuring the safety of life and property of the people in the Hong Kong and Kowloon areas. However, it is strange that such a large riot event would occur in the Kowloon area under the administration of the Hong Kong British authorities, and that the event was allowed to continue to escalate! What is even more infuriating is that when the thugs attacked Heung To Middle School, the school repeatedly called the Hong Kong police authorities for help, but they remained indifferent and watched the school burn down! As a people's teacher, I have to protest to the Hong Kong British authorities.

    We have every reason to demand that the Hong Kong British authorities: quickly take effective measures to stop the riots, severely punish the perpetrators, and learn a lesson so that they will not harbor an ambiguous attitude towards Kuomintang special agents in the future.

    I would like to extend my most sincere condolences to the Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots who have been frightened, suffered losses, and injured in the riots, and to the families of the deceased.

A Solemn Protest
To the Editor:

    We are extremely angry about the major riots created by Kuomintang special agents in Kowloon.

    We believe that the Hong Kong British authorities should be held responsible for the Kuomintang special agents being able to riot in Kowloon with impunity, because the Hong Kong Police Department did not take preventive measures beforehand; after the incident occurred, they did not take effective measures in a timely manner, which led to the further expansion of the riots.

    The atrocities of Kuomintang special agents in Hong Kong harming our compatriots are not limited to one instance, such as blowing up the "Kashmir Princess" plane and murdering our personnel who went to Bandung to attend the conference... These are all inseparable from the Hong Kong British authorities' indulgence towards them.

    We protest to the Hong Kong British authorities, demanding that they immediately and conscientiously fulfill their responsibility to maintain local order and protect the safety of all peaceful people in the area.

    We express our heartfelt condolences to the victimized compatriots.

Severely Suppress Kuomintang Special Agents
To the Editor:

    The major riots created by Kuomintang special agents in Kowloon have angered me to the extreme.

    Since liberation, the Chinese people have been living a happy life, marching towards a socialist society. The more joyous and happy the people are, the more the Kuomintang special agents hate. Therefore, they chose Hong Kong and Kowloon as the place to create disturbances, carrying out murder, arson, and robbery against our compatriots.

    Today, the Chinese people have stood up, and we absolutely cannot sit idly by while our compatriots are insulted, bullied, and even killed. We demand that the Hong Kong British authorities: must severely suppress the Kuomintang special agents and must not continue to condone their atrocities. The incident must be stopped immediately and not allowed to continue to escalate.

### 我们的愤怒，我们的抗议！

    我们的愤怒，我们的抗议！
    英国当局对九龙事件要负责编辑同志：
    我们对于国民党特务分子在九龙地区进行罪恶的大暴乱，表示万分的愤慨，并对九龙受难的同胞表示万分的同情和慰问。
    奇怪的是这一地区是在香港英国当局管辖之下的。英国当局竟能容忍暴徒们进行罪恶的暴乱继续如此之久，事先既不预防，发生暴乱以后也没有进行有效的镇压。我们认为这是同香港英国当局一贯纵容国民党分子的罪恶活动分不开的。我们还清楚地记得，1955年4月11日克什米尔公主号飞机被国民党特务分子破坏炸毁，香港英国当局非但没有把首恶分子逮捕法办，而且将已经逮捕的有关分子一一释放了。同样的，这次事件没有香港英国当局的纵容，是不会发生的。
    我们对香港英国当局这种态度提出强硬的抗议，要求香港英国当局坚决制止国民党特务分子的暴行，逮捕所有的罪恶分子予以严惩，并保证不再让国民党特务分子利用港九地区来对我国进行罪恶活动。中国人民完全有权提出这种要求。我们密切地关注着事态的发展，誓以实际行动支援港九同胞。北京医学院第二附属医院系统内科

    我以教师的名义抗议编辑同志：
    今天我在报上看到国民党特务分子在九龙制造大暴乱的消息以后，对国民党特务分子的穷凶极恶罪行感到无比愤怒！同时对香港英国当局对暴乱所采取的态度表示极为不满。
    香港英国当局，无须加以任何说明，它负有确保港九地区人民生命财产安全的责任。可是令人奇怪的是，在香港英国当局管理下的九龙地区，竟会出现这样大的暴乱事件，而且让事件继续扩大！更令人气愤的是当暴徒袭击香岛中学时，学校数次用电话向香港警察当局求救，它们却是无动于衷，眼看学校被烧掉！作为人民教师的我，不得不向香港英国当局表示抗议。
    我们完全有理由要求香港英国当局：赶快采取有效措施制止暴乱，严惩肇事祸首，并且应该接受教训，以后不能再对国民党特务分子抱暧昧态度了。
    我谨向在暴乱中受惊、受损失、受伤的港九同胞和死亡者家属表示最最亲切的慰问。　楼书聪
     严正的抗议编辑同志：
    我们对于国民党特务在九龙制造的大暴乱，感到极大的愤怒。
    我们认为，国民党特务之能在九龙暴乱而肆无忌惮，香港英国当局应当负责，因为香港警察局事先没有预防；事发生后没有及时采取有效措施，致使暴乱益形扩大。
    国民党特务在香港残害我国同胞的暴行已不止一次，例如炸毁克什米尔公主号飞机，谋杀我国到万隆开会的工作人员……这些都和香港英国当局对他们的放纵分不开的。
    我们向香港英国当局提出抗议，马上切实负起维持地方秩序的责任，保护当地一切和平人民的安全。
    我们对被害的同胞表示衷心的慰问。

    严厉镇压国民党特务分子编辑同志：
    国民党特务分子在九龙制造大暴乱，使我愤怒到了极点。
    解放以来，中国人民过着幸福的生活，向着社会主义社会大步迈进。人民越是欢乐和幸福，国民党特务越是仇恨。于是他们选中了香港九龙这地方制造了骚乱，向我国同胞实行杀人放火和抢劫。
    今天，中国人民已经站起来了，我们绝不能坐视自己的同胞遭受侮辱和欺凌以至杀害。我们要求香港英国当局：必须对国民党特务分子实行严厉镇压，不能再继续纵容特务分子的暴行。事件必须立即制止，不允许继续扩大。
