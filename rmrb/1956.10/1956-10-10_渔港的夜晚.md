　　Night in a Fishing Port
　　Guan Wenzu
    After the news of a severe storm forecast reached the sea off Nanjiu Island in the East China Sea, the fishing boats fishing there sailed in groups to Shenjiamen Harbor in Putuo County, Zhoushan to take shelter from the wind. At night, there were more than 10,000 fishing boats gathered here, from Zhoushan and Ningbo prefectures, as well as Wenzhou and Fujian. The fishing boats were next to each other, and seen from the shore, the tall masts were like an endless forest. Signal lights hung on the masts, and the electric lights on the shore were bright all night, making the night in the entire fishing port lively.

    Shenjiamen's only theater was performing "The Seventh Fairy Maiden Descends to Earth" for the fishermen, and a "Sold Out" sign was hung at the entrance of the theater early on. The counters of department stores and supply and marketing cooperatives were also crowded with people buying things; tens of thousands of fishermen crowded the streets and alleys of Shenjiamen.

    The loudspeaker on the shore was broadcasting the Yue opera programs most popular with the fishermen here: "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" and "Pan Fu Suo Fu." On the sea surface of the harbor, two wooden sailboats tied together had a white cloth hung on their masts, and a slide projector installed on another boat was projecting slides such as "Old Hero at Sea" and "The Monkey King Havocs in Heaven" onto this temporary "screen." The bows and sterns of the boats, far and near, were filled with "aquatic audience"; the shore was also filled with a dark mass of people, and when the slide show reached a tense point, applause rose and fell on the sea and on the shore.

    From a distant bow came the music of the phoenix zither and erhu ensemble, and a young fisherman was singing the "Yang Liu Qing" folk song. His clear voice attracted many listeners on the bows. As soon as he finished singing, applause from the audience followed. Then another young fisherman started singing the horse lantern tune…....

    On the shore, in the square of Shenjiamen Second Elementary School, hundreds of fishermen formed a large circle and were playing the game of "passing the flower while drumming." A young fisherman with his eyes covered with a towel was sitting in the middle of the circle, and the drumsticks in his hand fell on the drum surface like raindrops. A handkerchief was passed one by one among the fishermen around, and everyone hoped to pass the handkerchief to others as soon as possible, so as not to have the handkerchief fall into their hands when the drum stopped, and be punished to perform a program.

    The first program of the person who was punished was "The Blind Man Catches the Cripple," played by two young fishermen. As soon as the whistle sounded, the program began. A "blind man" with his eyes covered chased a "cripple" with one hand and one foot tied together according to the sound of the whistle. The "cripple" was about to be caught by the "blind man", and the people in the field became happy, but the clever "cripple" lay on the ground and set up an ambush at this critical moment, and the audience burst into applause, praising the "cripple" for his cleverness. Next up was a magic show by the young fisherman Shichang: "The Jar Drinks Water." Like a skilled magician, he showed the empty jar to the audience calmly, and then lit a stack of paper with fire and stuffed the burning paper into the jar. After a while, he turned the mouth of the jar upside down on a wooden basin filled with water and shouted: "Suck!" Strangely enough, the water in the basin was sucked into the jar. Thunderous cheers resounded across the square.

    The little drummer did not know where the energy came from, and he did not want to stop even after the handkerchief had passed a whole circle. Some clapped their hands and cheered, while others urged him to pass it quickly. Suddenly, the drum stopped, and the handkerchief fell into the hands of Captain Ashun, who usually did not like to talk much. He walked out uneasily, took a slip of paper from the box, and it read: "Please act like an old woman twisting a yangko dance." A burst of applause made him even more uneasy. He said in a panic: "I can't." The audience would not allow it, and he could not resist everyone, so he had to take a handkerchief and walked a few steps twisting his thick body, making everyone clap their hands and laugh.

    At the end of the party, several young fishermen still learned from Captain Ashun and left the venue twisting and twisting.

　　渔港的夜晚
  　管文祖
    大风暴预告的消息传到东海南韭山岛海面上后，正在那里捕鱼的渔船，成群结队地驶进舟山普陀县沈家门港湾来避风。入夜，云集到这里来的渔船足有一万多只，有舟山、宁波专区的，有温州、福建的。渔船一只挨着一只，从岸上望去，高高的桅杆像无边的森林一样。桅杆上悬挂着标灯，岸上的电灯也彻夜明亮，整个渔港的夜晚都是热闹的。
    沈家门的唯一戏院，正在为渔民演出“七姐下凡”，戏院门口早挂出“客满”的牌子。百货商店、供销社的柜台前，也挤满了买东西的人；几万个渔民把沈家门的大街小巷都挤得熙熙攘攘。
    岸上的扩音器在播送这里渔民最喜欢的越剧节目：“梁山伯与祝英台”和“盘夫索夫”。港湾的海面上，两只靠拢的木帆船桅上，挂起了一块白布，安装在另一只船上的幻灯机，正在向这块临时搭起的“银幕”上放映“海上老英雄”、“孙悟空大闹天宫”等幻灯片。远远近近的船头船尾上都坐满了“水上观众”；岸上也站满了黑压压的人群，幻灯演到紧张处，海面上和岸上的掌声此起彼落。
    远远的船头上传来凤凰琴和二胡合奏的音乐，有一个青年渔民正在唱“杨柳青”小调。他的清脆嗓音吸引了不少船头上的听众。他刚刚唱完，随着传来的是听众的喝采声。继之而起的是另一个青年渔民在唱马灯调小唱………。
    岸上，沈家门第二小学的广场上，几百个渔民围成了一个大圆圈，正在玩“击鼓传花”的游戏。圆圈中间坐着一个用手巾蒙住眼睛的青年渔民，他手中的鼓筷像雨点般地落在鼓面上，一条手帕在四周的渔民中，一个接一个传递，大家都希望将接过来的手帕早些传给别人，免得鼓点停时，手帕落在自己手里，被罚演一个节目。
    被罚的人的第一个节目是“瞎子捉拐脚”，由两个青年渔民扮演。哨子一响，节目开始了，一个用布蒙着眼睛的“瞎子”随着哨子的声音去追摸一个一只手和一只脚绑在一起的“拐子”。“拐子”很快就要被“瞎子”捉住了，场里的人快活起来，然而聪明的“拐子”在这紧要时刻往地上一躺打了个埋伏，全场响起了一阵掌声，都称赞“拐子”的机灵。接下去是青年渔民世昌表演魔术：“坛吃水”。他像个熟练的魔术家一样，不慌不忙地将空坛给观众看看，随即把一叠纸用火点着，把烧着的纸塞进坛里。过了一会，他将坛口倒放在一个盛满水的木盆上，喊声：“吸”。说也奇怪，盆里的水就吸进了坛子。广场上响起了如雷的叫好声。
    击鼓的小青年不知从那里来的劲头，手帕整整传递了一大圈他还不肯停，有的拍手叫好，有的催着叫快传。突然，鼓声停了下来，手帕落到一个平时不大欢喜说话的阿顺船老大手里。他不安地走出来，从纸盒里摸出一张纸条，上面写着：“请你装老婆婆扭一圈秧歌”。一阵掌声使他更加不安，他慌张地说：“我不会”。观众那里肯依，他蹩不过大家，只好拿条手帕，把那粗壮的身子一扭一扭地走了几步，逗得大家拍手大笑。
    晚会结束时，有几个青年渔民还学着阿顺船老大的样子，一扭一扭地离开了会场。
