Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th - Hong Kong News: Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao" and "Wen Wei Po" both published editorials today, firmly demanding that the Hong Kong British authorities take practical measures to protect the lives and property of Hong Kong and Kowloon residents.

	The Ta Kung Pao's editorial, titled "Swiftly Quell the Riots, Protect the Residents!", stated that under the rioting actions of Kuomintang secret agents, for two days and one night, most of the residents of Kowloon have been living in terror, as if trapped in a den of beasts, unable to defend themselves, completely unable to obtain the protection they deserve. A small number of rioters have become such a major problem, and some areas of Kowloon have been entirely under the control and rioting of rioters all day long, without being stopped. This is perplexing.

	The editorial believes that the Hong Kong British authorities' hesitation in suppressing the rioters and riots will only make the rioters more rampant, and the situation will become more serious, endangering the residents even more. The editorial stated that the residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon have the right to hope that the relatively firm measures taken by the Hong Kong British authorities yesterday can take effect as soon as possible, so that they can be liberated from the world of terror as soon as possible. They also have the right to demand that the Hong Kong British authorities take necessary measures to prevent such incidents from happening again.

	The "Wen Wei Po" published an editorial titled "The Riotous Actions Must Be Stopped Immediately." The editorial stated that the large-scale riots planned by Kuomintang secret agents have caused incalculable damage to the residents of Kowloon. The entire Kowloon is shrouded in an atmosphere of terror. The chaos and the severity of the situation are unprecedented. This riot has seriously threatened the lives and safety of Hong Kong and Kowloon residents. The editorial pointed out that this riot was prepared, planned, organized, and had a background, so the damage it caused was even worse than the disturbances caused by ordinary thugs. If the Hong Kong British authorities do not immediately take effective measures to deal with it, the harm it causes is truly unpredictable. The editorial urged the Hong Kong British authorities to do everything possible and take all effective measures to quickly quell the riots, in order to ensure the safety of residents' lives and property and maintain social order and tranquility.

    香港“大公报”和“文汇报”发表社论
    对镇压暴徒迟疑不决只会使暴徒更猖狂
    新华社广州12日电　香港消息：香港“大公报”和“文汇报”今日都发表社论，坚决要求香港英国当局采取切实措施，保障香港、九龙居民的生命财产安全。
    大公报以“速戢暴乱，保障居民！”为题发表的社论说，在国民党特务分子暴乱行动下，两昼一夜来，九龙大部分居民竟日处于恐怖中，如身陷兽丛，束手待噬，完全得不到应有的保障，少数暴徒竟成如此大患，而九龙一部分地区，竟然全日在暴徒统治暴乱之下，而莫之能禁，这是令人百思莫解的。
    社论认为，香港英国当局对镇压暴徒暴乱迟疑不决，只会使暴徒更猖狂，事态愈严重，居民益危殆。社论说，港九的居民有权利希望香港英国当局在昨天采取的比较坚决的手段能早早生效，使他们能早日自恐怖世界中解脱出来。他们也有权利要求香港英国当局采取必要的措施，防止此类事件再度发生。
    “文汇报”发表的社论题目是“必须立即平息暴乱行动”。社论说，国民党特务分子策划的大暴乱，使九龙居民受到了无可计量的损害，整个九龙笼罩在恐怖气氛中，情况之混乱，事态之严重，从未曾有。这种暴乱已严重威胁港九居民的生活与安全。社论指出，这次暴乱，是有准备、有计划、有组织、有背景的，故其所造成的损害较一般歹徒的滋扰尤甚，香港英国当局如不立即采取有效办法对付，则其为祸实不知伊于胡底。社论要求香港英国当局尽一切可能，采取一切有效办法，迅速平息暴乱行动，以确保居民生命和财产安全和维护社会秩序与安宁。
