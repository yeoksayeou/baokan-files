Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 8th: TASS reported from Paris on the 8th that the French National Peace Council held a meeting in Paris to discuss changes in the international situation and the struggle of the French people to peacefully resolve the Algerian issue. The National Peace Council adopted a letter to the French people, calling on them to strengthen their struggle to achieve a ceasefire in Algeria.

The letter to the people stated, "The government should negotiate with the opposing side in the fighting; this negotiation should aim at a ceasefire and a peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue, and neither side should put forward ultimatum-like demands or preconditions. The desire of the French people from all walks of life to end the Algerian war is growing stronger day by day. Social figures should demand negotiations in the most resolute manner. Millions of French people should sign their names on petitions demanding peace in Algeria."

The National Peace Council also heard a report by Émile D'Astier de la Vigerie on the current tasks of the French peace movement. The reporter proposed a series of measures to attract a broader mass of people to participate in this movement.
