Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 7th -- Preliminary exploration by geological personnel has confirmed that the eastern foothills of the Helan Mountains in northeastern Gansu Province and the southwest area of Zhuozi Mountain in Otog Banner, Ikezhao League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, constitute a large coalfield suitable for constructing a coal mine base. There are two adjacent large coalfields, Helan Mountain and Zhuozi Mountain, with coal-bearing zones stretching over 320 square kilometers and substantial coal reserves. Among the nine extractable coal seams, the thickest is 12 meters and the thinnest is 0.7 meters, all of which are gas-rich fat coal. These coals, along with prime coking coal and lean coal, can be refined into coke needed by the steel industry.

Currently, two geological exploration teams are conducting general and detailed surveys of the coalfield. Team 146, dispatched by the Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau, is already drilling in the southeastern wing of the Shizuishan coalfield. The Xi'an Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry has also established a preparatory organization for a coal mine in Shizuishan. The first thermal power plant on this coalfield has begun construction and is expected to generate electricity next year. The future branch line of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway is being surveyed. Construction workers are also building office buildings and dormitories here.

The development conditions of this coalfield are very good. During the exploration period, the Baotou-Lanzhou Highway and the Yellow River can be used to transport exploration equipment. In the future, after the dedicated railway branch line in the mining area is connected to the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, it will be even more convenient to transport coal from here to other places.

### 甘肃和内蒙古边界发现大煤田

    甘肃和内蒙古边界发现大煤田
    新华社西安7日电　甘肃省东北部贺兰山东麓和内蒙古自治区伊克昭盟鄂托克旗卓子山西南地区，经地质人员勘探初步证实是一个可供建设煤矿基地的大煤田。在那里共有贺兰山和卓子山两大片毗邻的煤田，藏煤地带绵延三百二十多平方公里，煤的储量很大。在可采的九层煤中，最厚的有十二公尺，最薄的也有七公寸，都是气肥煤。这些煤加上主焦煤和瘦煤，可以炼成钢铁工业需用的焦炭。
    现在，这个煤田上有两个地质勘探队正在分别做普查和精查工作。其中由西北煤田地质勘探局派出的一四六队，已经在石咀山煤田东南翼进行钻探。煤炭工业部西安管理局同时也在石咀山建立了煤矿筹建机构。目前，这个煤田上第一座火力发电厂开始动工兴建，明年就能发电；将来的包兰铁路的支线正在选线；建筑工人还在这里建设了一部分办公房屋和宿舍。
    这个煤田的开发条件很好。在勘探时期，便可以利用包兰公路和黄河运送勘探器材。将来矿区的专用铁路支线和包兰铁路接轨后，这里的煤炭向外地运送就更方便了。
