    Mr. Lu Xun and Folk Literature
    Zhao Jingshen
    I. Childhood Love for Folk Literature
    Mr. Lu Xun loved folk literature in his childhood. In "Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk," he talked about his grandmother telling him stories about cats and tigers on summer nights and giving him riddles to guess. He also mentioned that Chang Ma bought him "Classic of Mountains and Seas," where he saw "beasts with human faces; nine-headed snakes; one-legged cows"; and also saw the headless Xingtian who "used nipples as eyes, navel as mouth," and still "wielded a shield and battle-axe to dance." Chang Ma also told him the story of the snake woman. Mr. Lu Xun also watched "Village Opera" and "Mulian Rescues His Mother."
    However, in the past, our country really did not pay enough attention to children's books and education. In his childhood, Mr. Lu Xun could not even see books like "Children's Educational Pictures" and Sun Yuxiu's "Fairy Tales," but could only satisfy himself with the crudely printed "Classic of Mountains and Seas," with very bad images, almost entirely pieced together with straight lines. The folk story told by Chang Ma was also not suitable for young children. Mr. Lu Xun said, "This story made me feel the danger of being a human being. I was often worried when cooling off on summer nights and didn't dare to look at the walls." The village opera and Mulian opera were not specifically performed for children. Children loved to watch the village opera when it involved fighting or an old man with a white beard hitting a clown with a horsewhip, but when it came to the old woman sitting on a chair and singing slowly, the young Lu Xun was most afraid of it, and he didn't want to watch it. Apart from the appearances of the constables of hell, men and women being hanged, and the interlude of Wu Song fighting the tiger in the Mulian opera, other aspects were rarely worth his recollection. When he was young, Mr. Lu Xun wanted to see the Wuchang Temple Fair, but his father insisted that he memorize "Jian Lue" before allowing him to go, so he had no interest in watching the fair. "Even now, when I think about it, I am still surprised" that his "father wanted" him to recite the book at that time.
    I think that Mr. Lu Xun probably paid special attention to his son, Hai Ying's life, because he couldn't get happiness in his own childhood. Mr. Lu Xun said about Chang Ma, "In summer, when sleeping, she stretched out her legs and arms, making a 'big' character in the middle of the bed, leaving me no room to turn over." For Hai Ying, he prepared a small bed for him to sleep alone. I have seen this small bed in the Lu Xun Memorial Hall. In 1933, Mr. Lu Xun wrote a letter to Zhao Jiabi, lamenting that "the fairy tales published in China really need to be reorganized." I have checked the book accounts in "Lu Xun's Diary" and feel that his purchase of nine volumes of "Local Toy Collection" in his later years was related to Hai Ying and his own childhood memories.
    However, in any case, Mr. Lu Xun still received nourishment from folk literature in his childhood. His later writing of works such as "Old Tales Retold" and "Nanjing Folk Rhymes" should be said to be related to his childhood love of reading "Classic of Mountains and Seas" and listening to riddle songs. Mr. Lu Xun had fantasized in his childhood about "living in the mountains, with natural pavilions, giant ants as servants, named Achi and Ali, who could perform magic transformations." He also played in fairy tale dramas, "Big Head was unfortunately imagined as a ferocious giant, leading goats, occupying caves, and disturbing ordinary people, and his two friends, Small Head and Shrug Shoulder, each relied on their magical powers to conquer him." We can imagine how rich his imagination was at that time!
    II. Emphasis on Folk Literature
    Although Mr. Lu Xun did not have a special book or even a special article on folk literature, he attached great importance to it. He said: "The left wing also needs Tolstoy and Froebel… Especially Tolstoy, who wrote small stories for farmers to read… I believe that Tolstoy and Froebel can be produced from ballad singing and storytelling." ("Two Kinds of People in the Literary World": "On the Third Category") These words have given great encouragement to many people who love folk literature, especially those who use folk literature forms in their writing.
    Mr. Lu Xun's research on the "History of Chinese Fiction" also noted the "childhood of fiction." His edited "Gleanings from Ancient Novels" collected many myths, legends, stories, and jokes from various encyclopedias. If we carefully read the first seven chapters of the "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction" out of the twenty-eight chapters, we can see how much he valued the evolution of folk tales before the Tang Dynasty. He first recorded the story of the Queen Mother of the West, quoting "Classic of Mountains and Seas", "Classic of the Western Mountains": "The Queen Mother of the West looks like a human, with a leopard's tail, tiger's teeth, and is good at whistling, with disheveled hair and wearing a sheng headdress, in charge of the calendar and the five plagues." The "Classic of the Great Wilderness, West" says almost the same thing. But the "Classic of the Seas Within, North" only says: "The Queen Mother of the West leans on a table, wearing a sheng headdress and holding a staff. To her south are three blue birds, fetching food for the Queen Mother of the West, north of the Kunlun Ruins." By the time of the "Biography of King Mu of Zhou," the Queen Mother of the West became more approachable. The king invited the Queen Mother of the West to drink wine at Yaochi, and the two of them exchanged four-character poems, which was quite elegant. The terrifying images such as "leopard's tail and tiger's teeth" all disappeared. By the time of the "Classic of Strange Things," an "Eastern Duke" was added. By the time of the "Story of Emperor Wu of Han," the Queen Mother of the West "rode in a purple carriage, with jade girls driving; wearing seven sheng headdresses; with blue energy like clouds; with two blue birds, attending beside her." By the time of the "Inner Biography of Emperor Wu of Han," the Queen Mother of the West was not only not terrible, but also very beautiful, "with bright patterns, gentle and dignified appearance... she looked about thirty years old, of medium height, with a natural and elegant appearance, and an unparalleled face," almost like the Queen Mother of the West on the stage today. Secondly, the story of the goose cage scholar quoted not only Wu Jun of Liang's "Sequel to Qi Xie Ji," but also "Old Metaphors Sutra," Xun's "Ling Gui Zhi" of Jin, and Duan Chengshi's "Youyang Miscellaneous Morsels" of Tang, which was also very interesting. Other noteworthy points are the evolution of the story of the door gods at the end of the second chapter, and the story of the stupid son-in-law and the joke of carrying a long pole into the city gate at the end of the seventh chapter.
    We can also know that he attached great importance to folk literature by counting the books he purchased from "Lu Xun's Diary". He bought twelve volumes of the Japanese translation of "One Thousand and One Nights" and three volumes of the Russian translation of "One Thousand and One Nights," which are treasures of Arabian folk tales. He also bought the English version of "Ten Polish Folk Tales," the German version of "Grimm's Fairy Tales," the Japanese version of "Chinese Fairy Tales," three volumes of "Selected Japanese Fairy Tales," "Research on Nursery Rhymes and Fairy Tales," "Introduction to Mythology," three volumes of "World Fairy Tale Treasure Series," "Constellation Myths," and the Chinese version of "Yue Proverbs," "Mulian Rescues His Mother Opera," and "Illustrated Comprehensive Search of Gods of the Three Religions." The last one was used when talking about the door gods in writing "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction". He also bought "Buddha's One Hundred Parables Sutra" in 1929, and later printed and distributed many copies at the Nanjing Sutra Engraving Office.
    Mr. Lu Xun attached such importance to folk literature. Looking around at the general public today, they are extremely indifferent to folk literature. General literary publications rarely publish works in national forms. After Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art in 1942, new literature once valued national forms, and there were many excellent yangko operas, Qin operas, Yue operas, drum lyrics, and Li Ji's "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," which was written in the Shaanxi folk song style. Not long after, it seems that people are about to forget Chairman Mao's instructions again. Recently, Comrade Zhou Yang said at the Eighth National Congress that "the sorting out and research of folk literature and art... has carried out a series of works and achieved considerable results." But then he said: "However, this aspect of the work is only the beginning. Despising, rejecting, and rudely treating national traditions is still a major erroneous tendency in the current literary and art circles." I hope that when everyone commemorates Mr. Lu Xun, they can also reverse the bias and pay attention to folk literature.

    鲁迅先生与民间文学
    赵景深
    一　童年对于民间文学的爱好
    鲁迅先生在儿童时代就爱好民间文学。他在“朝花夕拾”里谈到他的祖母在夏夜讲猫和老虎的故事给他听，还打谜语给他猜。他又说起，长妈妈替他买来“山海经”，他看到了“人面的兽；九头的蛇；一脚的牛”；还看到“没有头，而‘以乳为目、以脐为口’还要‘执干戚而舞’的刑天”。长妈妈还讲过美女蛇的故事给他听。鲁迅先生也看过“社戏”和“目莲戏”。
    不过，我国过去实在太不注重儿童的书和教育了。鲁迅先生在儿童时代，连“儿童教育画”和孙毓修的“童话”一类的书也看不到，却只能满足于刻印都十分粗劣的“山海经”，图象很坏，几乎全用直线凑合。长妈妈的那个民间故事对于幼童也不适宜。鲁迅先生说：“这故事很使我觉得做人之险，夏夜乘凉，往往有些担心，不敢去看墙上”。社戏和目莲戏都不是为儿童而特别演出的。社戏演出打仗或是花白胡子用马鞭打小丑，儿童还爱看，一碰到老旦坐在交椅上慢慢的唱，是幼年的鲁迅先生所最怕的，他就不要看了。目莲戏除无常、男女吊、武松打虎的穿插等为鲁迅先生所爱好以外，其他也就很少值得他回忆的了。幼年的鲁迅先生想看五猖会，父亲却一定要他背熟了“鉴略”才许他去，以致他看会也无兴致，“至今一想起，还诧异”他的“父亲何以要在那时候”叫他来背书。
    我认为，鲁迅先生大概是自己幼年不能获得幸福，对于他的孩子海婴就特别注意起他的生活来。鲁迅先生说到长妈妈，“一到夏天，睡觉时她又伸开两脚两手，在床中间摆成一个‘大’字，挤得我没有余地翻身”，他对于海婴，就预备了一张一个人睡的小床，我在鲁迅先生纪念馆里就看见过这张小床。鲁迅先生在1933年曾写信给赵家璧，慨叹着“中国所出版的童话，实在应该加一番整顿”。我翻检过“鲁迅日记”中的书账，觉得他在晚年购买“土俗玩具集”九卷，也与海婴和他自己童年的回忆不无关系。
    可是，不管怎样，鲁迅先生还是从童年得到民间文学的滋养。他后来写作“故事新编”和“南京民谣”这些作品，应该说与童年爱读“山海经”，爱听谜语的歌，有些关联。鲁迅先生在童年就曾幻想过“居住山中，有天然楼阁，巨蚁供使令，名阿赤、阿里，能神变”。还扮演童话剧，“大头不幸的被想像为凶恶的巨人，带领着山羊，占据了岩穴，扰害平人，小头和耸肩的两个朋友便各仗了法力去征服他”。我们可以想到，他当时的想像力是多末的丰富！
    二　对于民间文学的重视
    鲁迅先生对于民间文学虽然没有专著甚至专文，他却是非常重视民间文学的。他说：“左翼也要托尔斯泰、弗罗培尔。……尤其是托尔斯泰，他写些小故事给农民看，………我相信，从唱本说书里是可以产生托尔斯泰，弗罗培尔的。”（“南腔北调集：”“论第三种人”）这几句话，曾给了不少爱好民间文学，特别是利用民间文学的形式写作的人很大的鼓舞。
    鲁迅先生研究“中国小说史”，也曾注意到“小说的童年”。他所辑的“古小说钩沉”，从各种类书上搜集了不少的神话、传说、故事和笑话。倘若我们仔细翻阅一下“中国小说史略”全二十八篇中的前七篇，就可以看出他对于唐以前的小说是多末注重于民间故事的演变。他首先记录了西王母的故事，引了“山海经”的“西山经：”“西王母其状如人，豹尾虎齿而善啸，蓬发戴胜，是司天之历及五残。”“大荒西经”所说也差不多。但“海内北经”却只说：“西王母梯几而戴胜杖，其南有三青鸟，为西王母取食，在昆仑墟北。”到了“穆天子传，”西王母就变得比较可亲近，天子请西王母在瑶池饮酒，他们俩还相互作四言诗酬答，颇为文雅。“豹尾虎齿”等可怕的形象都不见了。到了“神异经”又添出了一个“东王公”。到了“汉武帝故事”，西王母还“乘紫车，玉女夹驭；戴七胜；青气如云；有二青鸟，夹侍母旁”。到了“汉武帝内传”，西王母不但不可怕，还很漂亮，“文采鲜明，光仪淑穆………视之可年三十许，修短得中，天姿掩蔼，容颜绝世”，就跟今天戏台上的王母娘娘差不多了。其次，鹅笼书生的故事既引了梁吴均的“续齐谐记”，又引了“旧杂譬喻经”、晋人荀氏的“灵鬼志”以及唐段成式的“酉阳杂俎”，也很有兴味。其他像第二篇末叙门神故事的演变，第七篇末叙呆女婿故事和执长竿入城门的笑话，都是值得注意的。
    我们从“鲁迅日记”来统计他所购买的书籍，也可以知道他很重视民间文学。他买过日译的“千夜一夜”十二卷和俄译的“一千一夜”三卷，这是阿拉伯民间故事的宝库。他还买过英文本的“波兰民间故事十篇”，德文本的“格林童话集”，日文本的“支那童话集”、“日本童话选集”三卷、“童谣及童话的研究”、“神话学概论”、“世界童话宝玉丛书”三卷、“星座神话”以及中文本的“越谚”、“目莲救母戏文”和“绘图三教源流搜神大全”。最后一种，在写“中国小说史略”时，谈到门神，就用上了。还有1929年买了“佛说百喻经”，后来还在南京刻经处刻印了不少本推广流通。
    鲁迅先生是这样地重视民间文学。环观今天的一般人们，对于民间文学却极为漠视。一般文艺刊物很少刊载民族形式的作品。1942年毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话发表以后，新文艺曾经重视过民族形式，也出现了不少优秀的秧歌剧、秦腔、越剧、鼓词以及用陕北信天游民歌体所写作的李季的“王贵与李香香”。曾几何时，现在似乎又快忘掉毛主席的提示了。最近周扬同志在八大会议上说起“整理和研究民间文艺……进行了一系列的工作，取得了不小的成绩。”但接着却说：“但是，这方面的工作，还只是开始。轻视、排斥和粗暴地对待民族传统，仍然是目前文艺界一个主要的错误倾向”。我希望大家在纪念鲁迅先生的时候，能够同时扭转偏向，也能重视民间文学。
