Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 22nd: Hong Kong news: Zhang Mingde, a worker at the Po Sing Textile Factory in Tsuen Wan, Kowloon, told a "Wen Wei Pao" reporter about what he personally witnessed of the Kuomintang military intelligence agents' atrocities.

Zhang Mingde said: At about 4:00 PM on the 11th, I noticed a group of women wearing black skirts and white shirts singing reactionary songs like "Counterattack the Mainland" and "When Will We Return to Our Homeland" in front of the Po Sing Textile Factory gate. After singing for a while, some people started throwing stones at the windows of the Po Sing Textile Factory and shouting loudly. Soon, all the glass on the street outside the factory was smashed. Then, thugs gathered by Kuomintang agents, divided into two groups and rushed into the Po Sing Textile Factory. At this time, a person in the factory, surnamed Yu, was holding a colored cloth and standing on a high place, signaling to the thugs like waving a flag.

Zhang Mingde said: The thugs beat anyone they saw in the factory, using round-handled, square-headed wooden sticks, iron rulers, and water pipes. More than twenty workers were injured and bleeding on the spot. I originally lived on the third floor of the dormitory. When I went down to the second floor, I was intercepted by the thugs, who knocked me down with a large iron rod across my waist. Many thugs surrounded me and beat me severely. After the beating, they押 me to the "Standing Committee" of the "Free Labor Union" set up in the Po Sing Textile Factory. At about 10:00 PM, a person from the factory surnamed Wu, a member of the "Free Labor Union," ran over arrogantly and said, "This is the initial victory of our counterattack against the mainland!" This person surnamed Wu also revealed his identity to me aggressively, he is a Kuomintang military intelligence agent!

    九龙工人张明德目睹国民党军统特务行凶
    新华社广州22日电　香港消息：九龙荃湾宝星纱厂工人张明德对“文汇报”记者讲述了他亲眼看见国民党军统特务行凶的情形。
    张明德说：11日下午四点钟左右，我发现外面有一队穿黑裙白衬衫的女人对着宝星纱厂门口唱‘反攻大陆’和‘几时回家乡’等反动歌曲。唱了一会，就有人向宝星纱厂的窗口击石；并大声吆喝。厂外邻街的玻璃很快被全部砸碎。跟着，国民党特务分子纠集的暴徒，分开两批冲入宝星纱厂。这时，厂里有个性余的手里拿着一块有色的布，站在高处像打旗号似的向暴徒打招呼。
    张明德说：暴徒在厂内见人就打，用圆柄方头的木棍打，用铁尺打，用自来水管打，当场有二十几个工人被打伤流血。我本来是住在宿舍三楼，下二楼时被暴徒截住，他们用一根大铁棍拦腰把我打倒，好多暴徒同时围上来打，毒打完就押我到“自由工会”设在宝星纱厂内的“干事会”里。十点钟左右，一个姓伍的厂里的“自由劳工”跑来趾高气扬地说：“这是我们反攻大陆的初步胜利！”这个姓伍的还气势凶凶地向我透露出他的身份，他是国民党军统特务！
