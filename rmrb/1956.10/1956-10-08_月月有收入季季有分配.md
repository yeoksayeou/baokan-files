Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 4th: Up to now, the Quantang Agricultural Cooperative in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, has already distributed sideline income four times this year. There will be two more distributions within the year. It is estimated that each member household will receive eighty-two yuan this year from the agricultural cooperative's sideline income and family sideline income (excluding rice income), which is nearly double that of last year.

The Quantang Agricultural Cooperative is an advanced cooperative located near the rural market town of Shitan, mainly producing rice. Before joining the cooperative, members had a habit of engaging in transportation, pig raising, and chicken raising as sideline occupations. Last winter and this spring, they only focused on rice production and neglected sideline business. One production team, consisting of twenty households, used to have more than two hundred and thirty yuan in sideline income between last winter and this spring, but last winter and this spring, they had no cash income at all.

After the rice transplanting, the Quantang Cooperative Management Committee corrected this deviation. While focusing on doing a good job in rice production, they established a sideline brigade specifically to develop diversified operations: collective pig raising, sheep raising, fish farming, rice milling, vermicelli making, brick firing, and cultivation of sesame, chili peppers, taro, water lotus roots, and other crops. They also organized the cooperative's nineteen carpenters and bricklayers to carry out handicraft production. The Management Committee also helped members to carry out family sideline activities, providing assistance to members in arranging working hours and finding product sales channels. According to statistics from early May to mid-September, the cash income from the thirteen sideline businesses operated uniformly by the Quantang Cooperative reached more than 22,500 yuan. The income from members' family sideline businesses during the same period was at least more than 11,000 yuan.

Because the agricultural cooperative has monthly income, it has also achieved quarterly distribution. For example, in May, some members did not have money to buy food rations, firewood, and pocket money, so the agricultural cooperative distributed more than 2,800 yuan of pig raising income to the members. In July, members generally needed to make summer clothes and buy some food rations, so the cooperative distributed more than 6,700 yuan of income from brick firing, vermicelli making, and pig raising to the members. In September, everyone needed money to make autumn clothes and send their children to school, so the cooperative distributed another 5,033 yuan. These three distributions, plus the distribution of spring harvest crops this spring, as well as the 11,000+ yuan of members' family sideline income during the same period, totaled 25,600 yuan. Calculated based on the cooperative's more than 2,000 people, the average income per person was more than ten yuan, with the highest reaching more than two hundred yuan.

    月月有收入季季有分配
    新华社长沙4日电　到目前为止，湖南省湘潭县泉塘农业社今年已经分配了四次副业收入。年内还将有两次分配。估计每户社员，今年从农业社得到的副业收入和家庭副业的收入，可达八十二元（不包括稻谷收入），比去年要增加近二倍。
    泉塘农业社是一个位于农村集镇石潭市附近的以出产稻谷为主的高级社，社员在入社前就有经营运输、养猪、养鸡等副业的习惯。去冬今春他们只注意稻谷的生产，忽视了副业的经营，有一个生产队共有二十户，过去冬春之间，副业收入有二百三十多元，但在去冬今春，一个现钱收入也没有。
    插秧以后，泉塘社管理委员会纠正了这一偏向，他们在以搞好稻谷生产为主的同时，成立了一个副业大队，专门开展多种经营：集体养猪、养羊、养鱼、碾米、做粉、烧窑，种植了芝麻、辣椒、芋头、水藕等作物，还把社内十九个木匠、砌匠组织起来进行手工业生产。管理委员会也帮助社员开展家庭副业活动，在安排劳动时间和寻找产品的销路方面，都给社员以帮助。据五月初到九月中旬统计，泉塘社统一经营的十三项副业的现金收入就达二万二千五百多元。社员的家庭副业收入，同时期至少也有一万一千多元。
    农业社由于月月有收入，也就做到了季季有分配。例如五月份有些社员没有钱买口粮、柴火和零用，农业社就将养猪收入的二千八百多元分配给社员。7月份，社员普遍需要做热天衣服和买一部分口粮，社里又将烧窑、做粉、养猪的收入六千七百多元分配给社员。9月份大家正需要钱做秋天衣服和送小孩子上学，社里又分配了五千零三十三元。这三次分配加上今年春天春收作物的分配，以及同时期社员家庭副业的一万一千多元收入，共达二万五千六百元，以全社二千多人口计算，平均每人收入十元多，其中最多的达二百多元。
