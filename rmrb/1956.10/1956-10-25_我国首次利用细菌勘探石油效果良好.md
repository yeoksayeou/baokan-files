According to the Petroleum Industry News: Since June, the bacterial prospecting experimental team, composed of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Germplasm Preservation Committee and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, has been using bacteria to explore for oil in the Laojunmiao Oilfield and Qingcaowan exploration area in the western Jiuquan Basin. Good results have been achieved. It has not only proven that there are many bacteria that rely on natural gas to survive on the surface of the Laojunmiao Oilfield, but also found bacteria that rely on natural gas to survive in the abandoned wells of Qingcaowan. This is of great help to better developing oilfields and finding new oilfields. It is the first time for China to use bacteria to explore for oil.

Bacterial exploration is based on bacteria that rely on natural gas to survive and are distributed on the ground to judge the underground oil and gas storage situation, providing a reliable basis for further drilling. The bacterial exploration method can be quickly effective when combined with geophysical exploration methods. Because geophysical exploration can only explain the shape of the structure, but cannot explain whether the structure has oil and gas storage.

    我国首次利用细菌勘探石油效果良好
    据石油工业报讯　由中国科学院菌种保藏委员会和石油工业部组成的细菌勘探试验队从6月份开始，在酒泉盆地西部的老君庙油田和青草湾探区利用细菌勘探石油，收到了良好的效果，不但证明老君庙油田的地面上存在着许多依靠天然气生存的细菌，还在青草湾的废井里发现有依靠天然气生存的细菌，这对更好地开发油田和寻找新油田都有很大帮助。利用细菌勘探石油在我国还是第一次。
    细菌勘探是根据依靠天然气生存、分布在地面上的细菌，来判断地下储油储气情况，给进一步钻探提供可靠的依据。细菌勘探方法与地球物理勘探方法配合起来，就能很快地收到效果。因为地球物理勘探只能说明构造的形状，并不能说明构造是否有油气储藏。
