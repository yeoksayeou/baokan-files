    Underwater Forest - Kelp
    Huang Zongzhen
    As we sail on the Jiaozhou Bay in a yacht, we can see many bamboo rafts floating in the surging waves. However, the huge waves cannot wash away this series of bamboo rafts, as they are fixed to the seabed with anchors or rocks, standing in the sea like floating racks. That is the cultivation farm of China's emerging marine plant - kelp. Kelp grows luxuriantly on the seabed, forming a forest.
    Kelp is a food loved by the Chinese people, and it also has certain medicinal value. People living in the inland and mountainous areas, because ordinary food lacks iodine, will develop thyroid disease, with swollen necks, becoming the "goiter" disease. Kelp contains a relatively large amount of iodine, so eating kelp often can avoid this disease.
    In the past, China's oceans did not produce kelp, and it was imported from Japan and Korea.
    But about thirty years ago, when Japanese militarists were occupying Dalian, they built a harbor there, and brought kelp seedlings from Hokkaido, Japan, to cultivate in Dalian Bay, and later it sprouted and grew. After that, the Chinese working people cultivated kelp in large quantities in Dalian Bay of Liaodong Peninsula; then they transplanted the new seedlings of these kelp from Dalian to Yantai, Shandong.
    After liberation, the Party and the government vigorously promoted this marine production cause, creating thousands upon thousands of underwater forests in the vast ocean area of Jiaozhou Bay. Under the care and help of the Party, scientists' research work has overcome many difficulties. For example, in cultivating kelp in the ocean where the winds and waves are fierce, we created a floating rack method, tying the kelp seedlings to ropes, tying the ropes to bamboo rafts, and at the same time using anchors or huge rocks to tie the bamboo rafts, throwing them into the sea. In this way, rows of bamboo rafts can float on the sea surface, but they will not be washed away by the wind and waves.
    However, the fertilizer in seawater is not necessarily very dense and abundant. Experts from the Qingdao Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences ingeniously used pottery jars to install chemical fertilizers and placed them in the kelp cultivation areas, using artificial methods to fertilize, so that the kelp grows quickly, becomes large and fat, and has good quality.
    When kelp matures, it can be two or three zhang (6.6 to 9.9 meters) high. When the breeding season comes, it first grows sporocysts, and these cysts release tiny zoospores that are invisible to the naked eye. Each spore has two flagella, so the small zoospores can float or even swim in the sea. Once it finds a rock on the seabed, it attaches to it, slowly germinates and grows, and develops into filamentous gametophytes. These gametophytes are divided into male and female; the female is larger and can produce eggs, while the male is smaller and produces sperm. When sperm encounters an egg and combines, it slowly develops into a kelp seedling. Kelp's life, in cold oceans, can last for several or even decades. In China, the cultivated kelp, because the seawater temperature is too high in summer, can only live for one or two years, and must be harvested, otherwise it will easily rot in summer.
    The steps of kelp cultivation, simply put, are three stages: collecting spores (seed collection), seedling cultivation, and cultivating mature kelp. In the past, it was impossible to collect seeds and cultivate seedlings in summer due to the high summer water temperature along China's coast. In recent years, after research by the Qingdao Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, this difficult problem has been solved. They can use artificial methods to stimulate kelp sporocysts to release spores in early summer, then collect seeds and place them in cold storage rooms with low-temperature equipment, so that the seedlings can safely pass the hot summer. When the autumn cools and the seawater temperature drops, they are placed in the sea for cultivation. This not only allows the seedlings to avoid the summer heat, but also promotes growth, and can also promote the kelp cultivation cause to the southern Zhejiang coast. According to experts who told me in person, this year, summer seedlings from Qingdao will be transplanted on the Zhejiang sea surface to try to cultivate kelp.
    The ocean is boundless and deep. If dense and lush kelp forests can be cultivated on the seabed along China's coast, we will not only be able to fully supply the needs of the broad masses of people, but also provide necessary protection and food for fish, shrimp, shellfish, and other marine life, so as to increase the wealth of our motherland.

    海底森林——海带
    黄宗甄
    当我们乘着游艇在胶州湾海面航行的时候，我们在汹涌的海涛里可以看到很多的竹筏在波浪中飘浮着。可是巨浪并不能冲走这一连串的竹筏，它们有铁锚或岩石固定在海底，好像浮架似的竖立在海中。那就是我国新兴的海产植物——海带的养殖场。海带在海底丛生起来，蔚然成林。
    海带是我国人民所爱好的食物，它还有一定的药用价值。住在内地和山区的人民，因为一般的食品缺少碘质，就会发生甲状腺病，脖子臃肿起来，成为“大脖子”的毛病，海带里含有较多的碘质，如果常常吃海带，可以避免这种疾病。
    从前，我国的海洋中是不出产海带的，而是由日本和朝鲜进口的。
    但在大约三十年以前，当时，日本军国主义者正侵占着我国的大连，他们在那边修筑海港，并由日本北海道带来海带的种苗，养殖在大连海湾里，后来它居然发芽生长了。之后我国劳动人民就在辽东半岛的大连海湾大量养殖海带了；然后又把这些海带的新的种苗由大连移植到山东的烟台。
    解放之后，党和政府大力提倡这种海洋生产事业，在胶州湾一带的广阔的海洋中，营造着成千成万的海底森林。科学家的研究工作在党的关怀和帮助之下，克服了许多困难，比如说，在海洋里栽培海带，风浪掀天，我们创造了浮架式的方法，把海带幼苗缚在绳子上，把绳子系在竹筏上，同时用铁锚或巨大的岩石拴绑住竹筏，抛入海底，这样一排一排的竹筏可以在海面飘浮，但又不会被风浪冲走。
    可是海水中肥料不一定很稠密和富足，中国科学院青岛海洋生物研究室的专家们巧妙地用陶罐来装置化学肥料，放在栽培海带的地方，用人工方法来施肥，使得海带成长得又迅速、又肥大，品质又好。
    海带成熟的时候，可有二、三丈高，当繁殖季节到来的时候，它先长出了一颗一颗孢子囊，从这些囊中又放散出了肉眼看不清楚的微小的游孢子，每个孢子有两根鞭毛，因此小小的游孢子能在海中飘浮甚至游泳。一旦找到了海底的岩石，附着在上面，慢慢地发芽、生长，发育成丝状的配子体。这配子体有雌雄之别，雌的比较大，能产生卵子，雄的较小，会产生精子，精子碰到卵子，接合之后，慢慢地发育成海带的幼苗。海带的生命，如在寒冷的海洋里，可以活到数年或数十年，在我国养殖的海带，因为夏天的海水温度太高，只能活一、二年，就得收获，否则在夏天便容易腐烂。
    养殖海带的步骤，简单地说来，是采集孢子（采种），育苗，养殖成熟的海带等三个阶段。我国沿海的夏季水温较高，过去是无法在夏季采种和育苗的，近年来经过中国科学院青岛海洋生物研究室的研究，已经解决了这个困难问题了。他们能够在初夏的时候，用人工方法来刺激海带孢子囊放散孢子，然后采种，放在有低温设备的冷藏室中，使幼苗安全地渡过了炎夏，待到秋凉海水温度降低时，才放在海中养殖，这样既可使幼苗避免暑热，又可促进生长，同时可以把海带的养殖事业向南方浙江沿海推广。据专家们当面告诉我，今年在浙江海面将要开始移植青岛的度夏幼苗，试养海带了。
    海洋是无边的、深远的，如果我国沿海的海底都能栽培着繁茂浓密的海带森林，我们不但能充分供给广大人民的需要，更可给海中的鱼虾、贝类等以必要的保护和饵料，以增进我们祖国的财富。
