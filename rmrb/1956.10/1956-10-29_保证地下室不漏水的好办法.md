Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 27th: The operating methods of Tianjin construction worker Fu Zhenhai in doing waterproofing work have attracted the attention of construction departments in Tianjin, Beijing, Sichuan, Guangdong, and other places. This veteran worker, with more than 20 years of experience in waterproofing, has worked on more than 100 basements, and no water leakage or seepage has been found in one or two decades.

Fu Zhenhai uses his own formulated sodium silicate waterproofing agent mixed with cement. While the cement is about to dry but not yet completely dry, he applies a thin layer to the basement wall, stopping places where water leakage or seepage is not severe. Then, he applies a second thin layer to repair more severely leaking areas. By applying five layers in this way, the resulting waterproof layer is very strong and durable. In addition, before applying the cement, he cleans the wall very thoroughly, allowing the cement to bond tightly with the building, which can prevent cracks from occurring.

Using Fu Zhenhai's formulated waterproofing agent, the cost is 60% lower than general waterproofing agents. Applying 10,000 square meters of waterproof layer can save 3,000 yuan.

    保证地下室不漏水的好办法
    据新华社天津27日讯　天津市建筑工人傅振海做防水活的操作方法，引起了天津、北京、四川、广东等地施工部门的重视。这个做防水活有二十多年经验的老工人经手做过的一百多个地下室，一、二十年都没有发现漏水、渗水现象。
    傅振海用自己配制的矽酸钠防水剂掺和着水泥，趁水泥将干未干的时候，在地下室墙上抹上薄薄的一层，使漏水、渗水不厉害的地方不再漏水，然后，再薄薄地抹上第二层，把一些漏水较严重的地方修好。这样抹上五层，做出来的防水层就很坚固耐用。此外，在抹水泥以前，把墙刷得很干净，使得水泥和建筑物密实地结合起来，可以避免发生裂缝。
    用傅振海配制的防水剂，成本比一般防水剂低60％，抹一万平方公尺防水层可以节省三千元。
