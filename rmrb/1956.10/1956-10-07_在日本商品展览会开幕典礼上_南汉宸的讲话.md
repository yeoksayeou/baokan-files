Speech by Nan Hanchen at the Opening Ceremony of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition

Mr. Murata, President, Friends, Comrades:

    The Japanese Commodity Exhibition opens here today. On behalf of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, I sincerely congratulate the successful exhibition and express my respect to the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and friends from all walks of life in Japan for their active efforts in preparing for the exhibition.

    This Japanese Commodity Exhibition is being held in our two major cities, Beijing and Shanghai, as stipulated in the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. Some of the exhibits in this exhibition are items that are subject to the "embargo" of the Coordinating Committee for Export Control. Japanese friends have made great efforts to obtain these. We fully sympathize with our Japanese friends' regret that they were unable to exhibit items that fully represent Japan's industrial production level. However, the achievements that have been made are of great significance, indicating the ardent desire and strength of the Japanese people and people from all walks of life to lift the "embargo" and expand and restore normal trade relations between the two countries.

    In the past, due to the Yoshida Cabinet's various obstructions to Sino-Japanese trade, the First Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement signed in 1952 and 1953 was only 5.05% implemented, and the Second Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement only reached 38.8% of the total agreement. The implementation of the previous two trade agreements was indeed unsatisfactory. The implementation of the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement has made great progress compared with the previous two, especially the successful exhibition of this Japanese Commodity Exhibition, which marks a new atmosphere of progress in Sino-Japanese trade, and Sino-Japanese trade will have greater development.

    There is a broad prospect for the development of trade between China and Japan. Japan is our close neighbor, and due to geographical proximity, the economic exchanges between the two countries have had a traditionally close relationship in history. China and Japan have full conditions for developing trade, and the varieties of exchanges are also very extensive. Now and in the future, our country's construction needs many things from Japan. At the same time, our country can supply Japan with what it needs, which is of great importance to the normal development of Japan's peaceful industry and fully meets the interests of the Japanese business community and the broad masses of the people. We are willing to develop broad trade relations between China and Japan on the basis of peaceful coexistence and in accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefit. We believe that the abnormality of this relationship in the past was not due to the Chinese and Japanese business communities and the people of the whole country, but because the Japanese government followed the United States in implementing the "embargo" policy, which hindered trade between China and Japan. In recent years, with the continuous efforts of our government and people, as well as people from all walks of life in Japan who are enthusiastic about Sino-Japanese trade, Sino-Japanese trade has been restored to a certain extent, and the Japanese government has also had to express its willingness to make further efforts to actively export embargoed materials to our country, and has decided to use the "special approval system." We welcome this attitude and hope that Sino-Japanese trade relations will gradually develop normally as a result.

    Dear Japanese friends, although Sino-Japanese trade has made some progress, it is still far from our common needs. We have a responsibility to narrow this gap and take effective measures for the common interests of China and Japan. We should join hands and work together to establish normal trade relations between China and Japan! Strive to sign trade agreements between the two governments, payment agreements between the two countries' banks, and establish commercial representative offices in each other's countries!

    Finally, I congratulate the success of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition and wish the friendship between the people of China and Japan grow day by day.

    在日本商品展览会开幕典礼上
    南汉宸的讲话村田总裁先生、朋友们、同志们：
    日本商品展览会今天在这里开幕了。我代表中国国际贸易促进委员会衷心地祝贺展览会的胜利展出，并对日本国际贸易促进协会和日本各界朋友们在筹备展览工作上所尽的积极努力，表示敬意。
    这次日本商品展览会到我国北京、上海两大城市举办，是中日第三次贸易协定中规定了的。这次展览会上的展品其中有一些是属于巴黎统筹委员会“禁运”的物品。日本朋友们为此曾作了很大的努力才争取来的。我们十分同情日本朋友们所引以为憾的未能把足以代表日本工业生产水平的东西展出。但是，仅就争取到的成就来说，它蕴藏的意义是很大的，表示着日本人民和各界人士对于取消“禁运”，扩大和恢复两国正常贸易关系的热望和力量。
    过去，于1952年和1953年签订的第一次和第二次中日贸易协议，由于吉田内阁对中日贸易的种种阻挠，第一次中日贸易协议实际上只执行了5.05％，第二次中日贸易协议执行的情况也只达到协议总额的38.8％。以前两次贸易协议执行的情况的确是不能令人满意的。第三次中日贸易协定执行的情况，较前两次是大有进展的，特别是这次日本商品展览会的胜利展出，是标志着中日贸易进展的新气象，中日贸易将会有更大的发展。
    中日两国贸易是有着广阔的发展前途的。日本是我国的近邻，由于地理上的接近，两国的经济交流在历史上有过传统的密切关系。中日两国间具备着发展贸易的充分条件，交换的品种也是很广泛的。现在和将来，我国的建设上都需要日本很多东西。同时，我国能够供给日本所需要的东西，对日本和平工业的正常发展有着重要作用，完全切合日本工商界和广大人民的利益。我们愿意在和平共处的基础上，按照平等互利的原则发展中日两国广泛的贸易关系。我们认为这种关系过去的不正常，关键不在中国和日本工商界及全国人民，而是由于日本政府追随美国执行了“禁运”政策，使中日两国间的贸易受到阻碍。几年来，在我们政府和人民以及日本热心于中日贸易的各界人士的不断努力下，中日贸易已有了一定的恢复，日本政府也不得不表示要作进一步努力，积极向我国输出禁运物资，并决定援用“特别批准制度”，我们欢迎这一态度，并希望中日贸易关系将会因此逐渐获得正常的发展。
    亲爱的日本朋友们，中日贸易虽然有些进展，但是，与我们共同的需要还有很大距离，我们有责任把这个距离拉近，为中日双方共同利益采取有效的措施，我们应挈起手来共同为建立中日两国间的正常贸易关系而努力！为争取签订两国政府间的贸易协定，签订两国银行间的支付协定，互设商务代表机构而努力！
    最后，我祝贺日本商品展览会的成功，祝贺中日两国人民的友谊日益增长。
