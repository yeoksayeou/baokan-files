Xinhua News Agency, October 24th dispatch from Paris: The Moroccan Prime Minister Bekkai and Foreign Minister Belafrej, who accompanied the Sultan of Morocco on a visit to Tunis, arrived in Paris by plane on October 23rd from Tunis. That evening, they met with French Prime Minister Mollet for an hour, along with the Moroccan Ambassador to France, Bouabid, and demanded the immediate release of the Algerian nationalist leaders who were kidnapped by France.

A French official said after the meeting that Mollet rejected the Moroccan request, believing that this request "absolutely cannot be considered." Mollet also described the Moroccan Sultan's reception of the Algerian nationalist leaders as an "unfriendly act" towards the French government.

Moroccan Prime Minister Bekkai stated that they would no longer meet with Mollet and would leave France on October 24th. Bekkai told reporters that the situation was "very serious."

Some French newspapers condemned France's kidnapping of the Algerian nationalist leaders. "L'Humanité" pointed out on October 23rd that such actions could sharpen relations between France and Tunisia and Morocco.

    摩洛哥首相要求释放被捕者
    法国总理竟说“绝对不能考虑”
    新华社24日讯　巴黎消息：随摩洛哥苏丹到突尼斯访问的摩洛哥首相贝凯和外交大臣贝拉弗里杰10月23日从突尼斯乘飞机到达巴黎。当天晚上，他们就和摩洛哥驻法大使布阿比德同法国总理摩勒举行了一小时的会谈，要求立即释放被法国绑架的阿尔及利亚民族领袖。
    一个法国官员在会谈后说，摩勒拒绝了摩洛哥方面的要求，认为这个要求“绝对不能考虑”。摩勒还把摩洛哥苏丹接待阿尔及利亚民族领袖说成是对法国政府“不友好的举动”。
    摩洛哥首相贝凯表示他们将不再同摩勒会晤，并且将在10月24日离开法国。贝凯告诉记者说，局势“非常严重”。
    法国一些报纸对法国绑架阿尔及利亚民族领袖的行为表示谴责。“人道报”10月23日指出，这种行径可能使法国同突尼斯和摩洛哥的关系尖锐化。
