The Price Policy in Pastoral Areas Should Benefit the Development of Animal Husbandry
Wang Zaitian, Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region

Since the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the implementation of a relatively reasonable price policy has gradually narrowed the extremely unreasonable scissors difference between livestock products and industrial products that existed before liberation, playing a certain role in promoting production development and improving the living standards of people in pastoral areas. However, in the past two years, some new situations unfavorable to the development of animal husbandry have also emerged in the issue of prices. Generally speaking, since 1953, the purchase prices of many livestock products have been decreasing year by year, while the prices of industrial products and grain necessary for the production and life of farmers and herdsmen have increased to varying degrees. Here, I will use several numerical ratios and examples to illustrate the existing problems.

In October 1955, the Ministry of Commerce instructed that, in order to protect draught cattle, the purchase price of draught cattle should be increased by 15%, and the purchase price of beef cattle should be reduced by about 15%. In the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, there is only the distinction between large cattle and small cattle, and there is no distinction between draught cattle and beef cattle. Those that can be used as beef cattle are all good draught cattle. When the Ministry of Commerce specifically stipulated the cattle price plan, it uniformly lowered the purchase price of cattle in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region according to the national purchase price of culled beef cattle. From the second half of last year to the first half of this year, the purchase price of cattle was lowered twice, and the purchase price of cattle decreased by 13% to 20%. The purchase price of cattle hides also decreased by 20%, and the prices of sheep and wool also decreased. Compared with the same cattle in neighboring provinces, the price difference is 20% to 30%. Inner Mongolia is one of the livestock producing areas, and the purchase price is lower than that of neighboring provinces can only be corresponding, but the difference is so large that the masses have opinions. The result of the substantial decline in cattle prices has affected the price ratio between cattle and sheep, and the price ratio between wool and cotton. In the grassroots market, about one and a half catties of wool can be exchanged for one catty of cotton batting. But what about the prices of production and living materials necessary for herdsmen? It is the opposite of the above situation. Comparing 1956 with 1952: brick tea increased by 28%, silk and Mongolian boots increased by 20%, horse harnesses increased by 20% to 60%, and the unified sales price of fried rice and millet rice, one of the staple foods for herdsmen, increased to 28% to 36%.

This incorrect price regulation has affected the improvement of herdsmen's lives, affected the relationship between the Party and the People's Government and the herdsmen, and is unfavorable to the development of animal husbandry. There is a poor herdsman named Mingcang in Solon Banner. The government once lent him some money to support his production. He used the loan to sell three cattle, plus one of his own, a total of four. After three years, he developed to eight cattle, but because the price of cattle was low, if he wanted to pay off the loan, he would have to sell all eight cattle. For this reason, this herdsman often plays "hide-and-seek" with the bank's rural cadres.

Another example: Because the price of cattle was already low, many agricultural and pastoral joint cooperatives in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas were unwilling to raise cattle due to low profits. The masses said that raising cattle is not as good as raising sheep, and raising cattle and sheep is not as good as farming; sheep can also shear two catties of wool every year. Agricultural and pastoral cooperatives all use agricultural income to make up for the losses in animal husbandry. Because the price policy in pastoral areas has not been properly handled with the new situation, the production of animal husbandry has been affected to a certain extent, especially the impact on the development of large livestock. We don't know much about the situation in the country. However, based on the situation in recent years, the regulations on the price policy in pastoral areas have not been able to play a good role in stimulating production development.

There is no doubt that the state's price policy should first focus on studying and solving the problems of key areas, the majority of people, and bulk products. Failure to do so will be detrimental to the country's socialist construction and the improvement of the lives of the majority of people.

I listened to Comrade Li Xiannian's speech and the four achievements, six problems, and seven policies he proposed are correct, but what I feel is insufficient is that the price issue involving livestock and livestock products in pastoral areas was not clearly put forward. The price issue in pastoral areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas involves not only national accumulation and the improvement of people's lives, but also the development of production. The price issue in pastoral areas also involves national policies. How to help accelerate the development of the economy of minority nationalities is a problem. I hope that the relevant departments of the central government can pay attention to the price issues in minority areas when formulating price policies, especially the prices of livestock and livestock products, as well as the prices of industrial products and grain sold to pastoral areas. I think the problems of a few people are also the easiest to solve once they are noticed.

### 牧区物价政策要有利于畜牧业的发展

    牧区物价政策要有利于畜牧业的发展
    内蒙古自治区副主席　王再天
    内蒙古自治区建立以来，由于执行了比较合理的价格政策，逐渐缩小了畜产品和工业品解放前那种极端不合理的剪刀差的现象，对生产发展，对牧区人民生活的改善起了一定的作用。但近两年来在物价问题上也发生了一些不利于畜牧业发展的新的情况，概括说来就是：自1953年以来，许多畜产品的收购价格逐年下降，而农牧民生产和生活的必需的工业品和粮食则有不同程度的上升。在这里，我用几个数目字的比例和事例说明所存在的问题。
    1955年10月商业部指示，为了保护耕牛，将耕牛的收购价上调15％，将菜牛的收购价下调15％左右。内蒙古牧区只有大牛和小牛之分，没有耕牛和菜牛之分，能作菜牛的都是好耕牛。商业部在具体规定牛的价格方案时，把内蒙古自治区牛的收购价格统按全国残菜牛收购价格下调，从去年下半年到今年上半年二次下调，牛的收购价格下降了13％到20％，牛皮收购价也下降了20％，羊和羊毛价格也有下降。以同样的牛同邻省比较，价格相差20％到30％。内蒙古是牲畜的产区之一，收购价低于邻省也只能是相应的，但相差如此悬殊，群众是有意见的。牛价大幅度下降的结果，就影响到牛和羊的比价，影响到羊毛和棉花的比价。基层市场一斤半左右羊毛，才能换到一斤絮棉。但是牧民所必需的生产和生活资料的价格如何呢？正与上述情况相反。以1956年与1952年作比较：砖茶上升28％，丝绸、蒙古靴子上涨20％，马?上涨20％到60％，牧民吃的主食之一炒米、糜子米统销价上涨到28％至36％。
    这种不正确价格的规定，影响了牧民的生活改善，影响了党和人民政府与牧民的关系，对于畜牧业的发展是不利的。索伦旗有一个贫苦的牧民叫明仓，政府曾贷给他一些款子扶植他生产，他用贷款卖了三头牛，连原来自己有的一头共四头，三年之后发展到八头牛，但因为牛价低了，如果把贷款还清，就得把八头牛全部卖掉。为此这个牧民常和银行的下乡干部“捉迷藏”。
    另一个例子：由于牛价本来就低，半农半牧区的许多农牧联合社都因利少，不愿养牛。群众说养牛不如养羊，养牛羊不如种地；羊还可以每年剪二斤毛。农牧兼营的合作社，都是以农业收入来弥补畜牧业的亏损。由于对牧区价格政策未能随着新的情况做适当的处理，使畜牧业的生产受到了一定影响，特别是对大牲畜发展的影响。对于全国的情况，我们不大了解。但是，依据近几年来的情形看来，对于牧区价格政策的规定，是没有能够很好地起到刺激生产发展的作用的。
    毫无疑问，国家的价格政策，应该首先着重研究解决重点地区的、多数人的、大宗产品的问题，不这样做就不利于国家社会主义建设和大多数人生活的改善。
    我听了李先念同志的发言提出的四条成绩、六个问题、七项政策，说得是对的，但感不足者对于涉及牧区牲畜和畜产品的价格问题未明确提出，牧区和半农半牧区的物价问题，除涉及到国家积累，人民生活的改善，涉及到生产的发展，牧区物价问题还涉及到民族政策问题。如何帮助加速发展少数民族的经济问题，希望中央有关部门在制定价格政策时，能注意到少数民族地区物价问题，尤其是牲畜和畜产品以及销售到牧区的工业品和粮食的价格问题，我想少数人的问题一经注意也最容易得到解决的。
