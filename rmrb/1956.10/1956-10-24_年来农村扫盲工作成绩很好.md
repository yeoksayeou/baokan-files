According to preliminary statistics from sixteen provinces and cities, including Henan, Shanxi, and Beijing, 4.1 million people had been freed from illiteracy before the wheat harvest. In Henan Province, 800,000 people received literacy graduation certificates. In Jiangxi Province, 220,000 people reached the literacy standard. Many farmers have learned to keep work-point accounts and recognize work tickets.

    年来农村扫盲工作成绩很好
    据新华社讯　一年来，农村扫盲工作成绩很好。据河南、山西、北京等十六个省市的初步统计，在麦收前已经有四百一十万人摆脱了文盲状态。河南省有八十万人领到了扫盲毕业证书。江西省有二十二万人达到了扫盲标准。有许多农民学会了记工账，认工票。内蒙古自治区安北县今年六月参加扫盲学习毕业的四百零八名学员中，有二百三十人已经担任了合作社的会计和技术员。
    各地农民即使是农忙季节，也坚持常年学习。坚持常年学习的人数，占今春入学农民六千二百万的50％左右。
