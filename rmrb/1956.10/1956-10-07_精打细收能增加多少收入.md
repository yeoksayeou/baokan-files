How Much Can Careful Harvesting Increase Income?

"How much income can careful harvesting actually increase?" Most cadres and members of the Dongdiaoyutai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zongshizhuang Township, Jin County, had varying degrees of doubt about this question. Since the instruction to "achieve careful harvesting, bring every grain home, ensure that more than 90% of cooperative members increase their income and support disaster areas" was implemented in the Dongdiaoyutai Agricultural Cooperative, the members discussed it in small groups. Some said: Every harvest, we are told to be careful, but how much more grain can this actually yield? Some members even thought: Can anyone eat without dropping rice grains? These all reflect that many members lack a proper understanding of the significance of careful harvesting.

The autumn harvest is about to begin in full swing. In order to educate cadres and members with facts, dispel their doubts about careful harvesting, and correct incorrect views, the cooperative's director Zhang Fenghua, Chen Jianhua, Zhang Wenyu, and the village work team went to the seventh production team on the afternoon of August 30th, after hearing that their millet harvest was complete, to pick up the millet ears left in the field. As a result, they collected twelve and a half taels of millet ears from a 1.15-mu plot of land, which, after threshing, yielded nine and a half taels of clean millet. Extrapolating this, the cooperative would lose 2,070 jin of millet from its 552 mu of millet fields. The next morning, the cooperative director and others went to the sixth team's cornfield to inspect. They collected five jin of corn ears from a 0.6-mu plot of land, which, after removing the husks and cobs and drying, yielded two jin and ten taels of corn kernels. Extrapolating this, the cooperative would lose 2,198 jin of corn from its 498 mu of spring corn fields, amounting to a total loss of more than 4,200 jin of grain from these two items alone. Someone calculated that this amount of grain would be enough for twelve adults to eat for a year, assuming an annual consumption of 360 jin per person. If sold at a price of eight fen per jin, it would be worth more than 3,400 yuan, enough to buy thirty-four head of cattle (at 100 yuan per head).

In order to further educate cadres and the masses and ensure careful harvesting in the future, the cooperative convened meetings of cadres and members on the same day. The next day, all seven production teams in the cooperative not only practiced careful harvesting, but each team also selected three people to conduct a thorough inspection. Now, the question of "How much can careful harvesting actually increase income?" has been completely resolved in the Dongdiaoyutai Agricultural Cooperative. (Yin Cheng)

### 精打细收能增加多少收入

    精打细收能增加多少收入
    “精打细收究竟能增加多少收入？”这个问题，晋县总十庄乡东钓鱼台农业生产合作社的大部分的干部、社员都存在着不同程度的疑问。自从“要做到精打细收，颗粒还家，保证90％以上的社员增加收入和支援灾区”的指示贯彻到东钓鱼台农业社后，社员们就三三两两地议论着，有的说：每年收割，都是要我们精打细收，可是这又能多打多少粮食呢？有的社员甚至认为：谁还能吃饭不掉饭粒吗？这些都反映出不少社员对精打细收的意义缺乏应有的认识。
    秋收就要全面开始了，社主任张凤学、陈建华、张文玉和驻村工作组为了要以事实教育干部和社员，解除他们对精打细收的疑问和端正不正确看法，8月30日下午，他们听说第七生产队的谷子收完了，四个人便去七队拾遗落在地里的谷穗，结果在一块一分五厘大的地里拾得谷穗十二两半，搓净后也有九两半，这样推算全社五百五十二亩谷地就将少收谷子二千零七十斤。第二天上午社主任等又到六队的玉米地里去检查，在一块六分大小的地里拣回玉米穗五斤，经去皮、去轴、晒干后得玉米粒二斤十两，推算全社四百九十八亩春玉米无形中又少收了玉米二千一百九十八斤多，仅这两项就丢失了粮食四千二百多斤。有人算了一下账，如按成年人一年吃粮三百六十斤计算，这些粮食就够十二人吃一年，又如以八分一斤按价出卖，折人民币三千四百多元，可买耕牛三十四头（每头一百元计算）。
    为了进一步教育干部和群众，保证今后收割中的精打细收，当天社里就先后召开了干部和社员会议。第二天，全社七个生产队，不但都做到精打细收，每个队还抽出三个人，又普遍进行了检查。现在，“精打细收究竟能增加多少收入？”这个问题在东钓鱼台农业社里已经彻底解决了。　（尹成）
