	A Fishing Island in the East Sea
		Mao Dechuan
	Langgang Mountain is a small island in the East Sea. Although it is small, its reputation is not small. People living in the Zhoushan Islands and fishermen along the coast of Zhejiang almost all know it. During the autumn fishing season, I had wanted to see it for a long time, but I was stopped several times by typhoons. On one day in September, I finally took the motorized sailboat of the Putuo County Fisheries Production Command to this small island. The boat left Shenjiamen fishing port at a little after 7:00 in the evening, and the lights on the fishing boats were gradually left behind. Rounding the mountain pass, Putuo Mountain was to the right in front. The compass pointed to the letter N (North), and the boat sped forward. We sat on the top of the cabin, sometimes looking up at the starry sky, sometimes looking at the white and red sea beacons far and near. After the boat passed Putuo Mountain, it headed northeast, the sea surging, and the boat tilted from side to side from time to time. Comrade Su, who was traveling with me, vomited constantly. The sea breeze blew, and we already felt the chill. At about 10 o'clock, we saw a light in front of us, which was the Xiaoban Island lighthouse. Several mountain shadows stood quietly in the sea. These are the Zhongjie Mountain Islands. This place is 140 li away from Putuo County. The islands are scattered and inhabited by more than 5,000 people. It is a district of Putuo County - the Dongji District.
	The next morning at 4:30, dawn was breaking, and brocade-like colored clouds in the east enveloped the sea. The fiery red sun jumped out of the sea all at once, and light drove away the darkness. Overlooking the Miaozihu and Qingbin Islands, the mountains are beautiful. The ancient "sea island" really has a misty Penglai feeling. After a while, the sky seemed to be covered with golden goose down blankets, and I felt refreshed. The boat bypassed the strait between Miaozihu Island and Qingbin Island, and accelerated the horsepower slightly north-northeast, and the boat galloped on the waves. The sea became wider and wider, and the water was turbulent and uneven. The motorized sailboat broke through thousands of layers of waves and moved forward.
	The boat anchored about 200 meters northwest of Langgang Mountain, and dared not get any closer. We lowered a small sampan and rowed over. As the sampan approached the shore, we jumped onto the rocks and stood firm, then climbed up the cliff. After crossing the back of the mountain, the fishermen warmly surrounded us.
	This small Langgang Mountain island, which is isolated in the East Sea, is only two li long and less than one li wide. I climbed to the "highest point" and looked into the distance, and I could really see thousands of miles. The faint mountain shadows in the northwest by north are Shengshan Island and Gouqi Island; the southwest by south is Qingbin Island; looking back west, the motherland cannot be seen; the east cannot distinguish between the blue waves and the floating clouds, only the boundless blue. Langgang Mountain is the end of the country to the east.
	The southeast and northeast sides of Langgang Mountain are all cliffs and jagged rocks. The mountain is like a knife, standing straight from the bottom of the sea. The water is deep and blue-black. There are no beaches around the island; large rocks that have been scraped down all year round have accumulated on the seabed near the mountain, so the anchorage is poor. There are many rugged and dangerous reefs in the middle of the three mountains, as well as many submerged reefs. The sea waves are rushing and swirling here, and white waves rise from time to time, sounding like thunder. No wonder the waves here can hit halfway up Langgang Mountain during a big storm.
	The sea around Langgang Mountain is rich in hairtail and small yellow croaker. Fishermen in eastern Zhejiang have a saying that praises the abundance of fish here: "The west head of Langgang, one net for two boats." The autumn fishing season here produces valuable seafood: mussels and whitebait; there is seaweed in winter, which is a rich fishing ground.
	There is only a small land temple on Langgang Mountain, built in the seventeenth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty; there are no houses on the island. During the autumn fishing season, fishermen who come to Langgang Mountain to fish live in thatched sheds. It is said that this island has been developed for more than a hundred years. It was first developed by people from Daqi Tou in Zhenhai County, and it paid grain taxes during the Qing Dynasty. However, now there are many desolate graves here. Asking fishermen who are familiar with this place, they mentioned the bitter past before liberation.
	Langgang Mountain is far from the mainland, and is most afraid of strong winds. When the wind blows, the raging waves block the mountain. In the old society, fishermen used dilapidated fishing gear to go to Langgang Mountain to fish, and often encountered danger and disaster. The land temple was built with money raised by the fishermen. The fishermen raised money to buy five dou of rice, a pot, and some firewood and put them in the temple for a long time, so that fishermen who were in trouble here could eat and use them. In addition, a coffin was also placed in the temple. The coffin was prepared to collect the bodies of fishermen who unfortunately died at sea. If people used these, they always quickly tried to buy replacements and put them back in the temple. However, the Kuomintang's "ocean protection team" robbed everything, even the coffin. After that, no one prepared them anymore.
	The fishermen said that once, during a storm, a fisherman who was in distress at sea came here. He went up the mountain with joy, but saw that there was no firewood or rice, and no one came to rescue him. He starved to death here. Later, people found his body and the words he wrote on the wall by biting his finger before he died: "Langgang has three mountains, and there are ten thousand difficulties up and down! If there is a bowl of thin porridge at home, I would rather die than go to Langgang Mountain!"
	This story is circulated among the fishermen, and they all regard coming to Langgang Mountain as a dreaded thing.
	Although the reefs here are dangerous, the waves are big, and there are many dangers, the abundant fish production lures fishermen who are forced by life to risk coming here to fish, and people are constantly buried in the bellies of fish. Fishermen often fish out the bodies of fishermen of unknown origin from the sea. Kind-hearted fishermen bury them on their behalf. This is the origin of the many desolate graves on the island. This is the bitter past. After liberation, Langgang Mountain is very different from what it used to be.
	This autumn fishing season, there are particularly many people coming to Langgang Mountain to fish, all of whom are members of the fisheries production cooperatives. The cooperatives regularly send large boats to bring sufficient food, supplies, and fresh water to the fishermen, and transport the whitebait and mussels back. The fishermen can receive old wine sent from home, and can also send letters to their families. They also organize temporary supply and marketing stores to sell cigarettes, biscuits, and medicines. Langgang Mountain is not lonely now. Fishermen can hear sounds from the motherland from the radio. The People's Government has built lighthouse beacons and storm warning stations on the top of Langgang Mountain. The beacon light on Langgang Mountain flashes twice every six seconds, with a range of twelve nautical miles. Fishermen fishing here can know the arrival of storms in advance, and can also find their way in the dark.
	It is extremely difficult to drink water on Langgang Mountain. There are only two water pools here now, with about ten dan of water. The Zhoushan Prefectural Aquatic Products Bureau and the Putuo County People's Committee have surveyed and designed three new houses and two fresh water reservoirs on Langgang Mountain. After these two fresh water reservoirs are completed, they can store 10,000 dan of water, and construction preparations are now underway. During the hairtail fishing season this winter and the small yellow croaker fishing season next spring, tens of thousands of fishermen from Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, and Shandong will set sail to the Langgang Mountain fishing ground to fish.
	The fishermen now call Langgang Mountain a "treasure island". The fishermen of the Zhoushan Islands are now singing: "The red flag is flying on Langgang Mountain, and it is not difficult to go up and down! Lighthouse and storm warning stations have been established, and patriotism and increased production depend on this mountain!" The tragic experiences of fishermen in Langgang Mountain in the past are gone forever!

    东海里的一个渔岛
  　毛德传
    浪岗山是东海的一个小岛，岛虽小，但它的名声可不小，住在舟山群岛的人们和浙江沿海的渔民几乎无人不知道它。秋汛期，我早想去看看，几次都被台风所阻。9月的一天，我终于乘普陀县渔业生产指挥部的机帆船到这个小岛上去。船离沈家门渔港是在晚上七点多钟，点点渔船上的灯火渐渐地被抛在后面了。绕出山嘴，右前面是普陀山，方向盘指着N（北）字，船疾进着。我们坐在舱顶，时而仰观满天繁星，时而望着远远近近闪着白色、红色的海中灯标。船驶过普陀山，朝东北方向走，海涛翻翻滚滚，船身不时左右倾斜。同行的苏同志呕吐不已。海风吹来，我们已感到寒意。十点钟许，见前面有亮光，那是小板岛灯塔。有几座山影静悄悄地屹立在大海中，这是中街山列岛。这里距普陀县一百四十里，岛屿分散，居住着五千多人，是普陀县的一个区——东极区。
    次晨四点半，曙光微露，东方织锦般的彩霞笼罩海面，火红的太阳一下子从海里跳出来，顿时光明驱走了黑暗。眺望苗子湖、青滨诸岛，山峦灵秀，古时所谓“海中洲”之地，真有蓬莱飘渺的感觉。一会儿，天上又似披着金黄色的鹅绒毯，胸怀顿觉爽朗。船绕过苗子湖岛与青滨岛间海峡，径朝东北略偏北加速马力，船在波涛上飞驰，洋面愈来越宽，水势冲激旋回不平，机帆船冲破了千层海浪前进着。
    船在浪岗山西北约二百公尺处抛锚，再也不敢近傍了。吊下小舢舨，我们划过去，舢舨近岸，我们跳到岩石上立稳，然后攀崖而上。越过山背，渔民们亲热地围上来了。
    这个孤悬在东海中的浪岗山小岛，长只二里，宽还不到一里。我攀临“制高点”远望，真是极目千里。西北偏北处淡淡的山影是嵊山岛、枸?岛；西南偏南处是青滨岛；回头西望祖国大陆已无法见到；东方分不清那是碧波，那是浮云，只是无边无际的蓝色。浪岗山往东已尽国境。
    浪岗山的东南、东北面，都是悬崖峭壁，岩石嶙峋，山像刀削一样，笔直矗立于海底，水深呈蓝黑色，岛四周无沙滩；近山处海底积累有常年被刮下的大石，因此锚地不良。三座山中间有许多崎岖的险礁，还有不少隐伏在水中的暗礁，海浪在这里湍急奔旋着，不时腾起雪白的浪花，听来像雷震一般。无怪乎大风暴时，这里的浪花要打过浪岗半山高了。
    浪岗山四周海中，盛产带鱼、小黄鱼，浙东渔民有句俗语称颂这里的鱼多：“浪岗西嘴头，一网两船头”。这里秋汛产名贵的海味：淡菜、海蜒；冬季有紫菜，是个丰饶的渔场。
    浪岗山上只有一座小土地庙，建于清光绪十七年；岛上没有房屋。秋鱼汛时，往浪岗山捕鱼的渔民，都搭草棚居住。传说，这个岛开辟有百余年了，最早是镇海县大碶头人开发的，清朝时曾纳粮赋。但是，现在这里是荒冢累累。询问熟悉这里的渔民，他们提起了解放前的辛酸事。
    浪岗山距大陆远，最怕大风，刮了风，狂浪就把山封锁住了。在旧社会，渔民用破旧的渔具，远到浪岗山来捕鱼，往往遇险遭难。土地庙是渔民凑钱盖的，渔民们凑钱买五斗米、一口锅和一些柴禾长期放在庙里，以备在这里遇难的渔民吃用。除此之外，还在庙里放有一口棺材，棺材是备收殓不幸遭海难的渔民用的。人们若用了这些，总是很快设法置买还放庙里。可是国民党的“护洋队”把一切东西连棺材都抢走了。以后，就无人再备放了。
    渔民们说，有一次风暴中，海上遇险的一个渔民来到这里，他满心欢喜上山，一看没有柴米，又无来救援的人，他被饿死在这里了。以后人们发现了他的尸首，以及他死前咬破手指在墙上写下的话：“浪岗三块山，上下十万难！家中有口薄粥饭，宁死勿上浪岗山！”
    这个故事，在渔民中流传着，都把来浪岗山视为畏途。
    这里虽然礁险，浪大，危险多，但丰饶的鱼产，引诱着为生活所迫的渔民，不得不冒险来此捕鱼，也不断有人葬身鱼腹。渔民们常从海里捞起不知姓名的渔民尸体，好心的渔民就代为掩埋，这就是岛上累累荒冢的由来。这是过去的辛酸事。解放后，浪岗山已和从前大不相同了。
    今年秋汛，来浪岗山捕鱼的人特别多，都是渔业生产合作社的社员。合作社按时派大船为渔民们送来充足的粮食、用品和淡水，把海蜒、淡菜运回去。渔民们可以收到家中捎来的老酒，也可以带信给家人。他们还组织临时供销店出售香烟、饼干和药品。现在浪岗山并不寂寞了。渔民们可以从收音机里听到由祖国大陆传来的声音。人民政府在浪岗山顶上建造了灯桩航标和风暴警报站。浪岗山上的标灯每六秒钟闪二次，射程为十二浬。在这里捕鱼的渔民可以预先知道风暴的到来，也可以在黑夜里找到方向。
    浪岗山上饮水极困难，现在这里仅有两个水潭，约有十来担水。舟山专署水产局和普陀县人民委员会已勘察设计好，在浪岗山新建房屋三间，淡水库两个。这两个淡水库建成后可蓄一万担水，现正作施工准备。今冬带鱼汛、明春小黄鱼汛期，将有浙江、福建、江苏、山东数万渔民扬帆来浪岗山渔场捕鱼。
    渔民们现在叫浪岗山为“宝岛”。舟山群岛的渔民现在唱着：“红旗飘扬在浪岗山，上下并不难！建立了灯塔报风站，爱国增产靠此山！”过去渔民在浪岗山的悲惨遭遇，已经一去不复返了！
