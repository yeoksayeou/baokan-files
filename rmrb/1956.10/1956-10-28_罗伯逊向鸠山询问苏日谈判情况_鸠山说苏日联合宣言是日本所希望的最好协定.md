Xinhua News Agency, October 27th: New York dispatch: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson met with Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama in New York on October 26th to discuss the Soviet-Japanese negotiations and other issues.

Ichiro Hatoyama, who signed the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration in Moscow, is on his way back to Japan. Robertson made a special trip from Washington to meet with Hatoyama. Since the successful conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, the United States has shown excessive concern about the outcome. The U.S. State Department issued a statement on October 24th, stating that while it considered it appropriate for the Soviet Union and Japan to end the state of war, it expressed "regret" over the Soviet Union's rejection of Japan's claims to the southern part of the Kuril Islands.

News reports indicate that during the meeting, Robertson inquired of Hatoyama about the Soviet-Japanese negotiations. According to a Japanese spokesman, Hatoyama replied that, under the current circumstances, the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration is the best agreement that Japan could hope to obtain. Hatoyama also said that he hoped this joint declaration would ease tensions in the Far East.

The Japanese spokesman said that Hatoyama and Robertson also discussed the situation in China, the political situation in Asia, and other international issues.

On October 26th, United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld visited Ichiro Hatoyama. After the Soviet Union expressed its support for Japan's participation in the United Nations, Japan is hoping that this session of the United Nations General Assembly will admit Japan as a member state.

The Japanese delegation led by Hatoyama, which participated in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, is scheduled to leave New York today and return to Japan via San Francisco.

    鸠山说苏日联合宣言是日本所希望的最好协定
    据新华社27日讯　纽约消息：美助理国务卿罗伯逊10月26日在纽约会见了日本首相鸠山一郎，就苏日谈判等问题举行会谈。
    在莫斯科签订了苏日联合宣言的鸠山一郎正在回国的途中。罗伯逊特地从华盛顿赶来会见鸠山。自从苏日谈判圆满结束后，美国对谈判的结果表现了过分的关心。美国国务院在10月24日发表了一个声明，它在认为苏日两国结束战争状态是很适当的同时，却对苏联拒绝日本对千岛群岛南部的要求表示“遗憾”。
    有消息报道，在会谈中，罗伯逊向鸠山询问了苏日谈判的情况。据日本发言人说，鸠山回答说，在目前情况下，苏日联合宣言是日本所能够希望得到的最好的协定。鸠山又说，他希望这个联合宣言会缓和远东的紧张局势。
    日本发言人说，鸠山和罗伯逊还谈到了中国的情况、亚洲的政治情况和其他国际问题。
    10月26日，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德访问了鸠山一郎。在苏联表示支持日本参加联合国以后，日本正在希望这一届联合国大会将接纳日本为会员国。
    以鸠山为首的参加苏日谈判的日本代表团订于今天离开纽约，取道旧金山回国。
