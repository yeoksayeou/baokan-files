    On “Anthologies”
    Qí Shì

    I sometimes feel that we have now entered an era of “anthologies” again. Walking into a bookstore, you can see all kinds of anthologies, but it's more difficult to find a relatively complete collection of works.

    There may be various reasons for publishing anthologies. For example, anthologies can save paper, and cater to readers' purchasing power and their time and energy for reading. This may all be out of good intentions. Selectors, authors, or translators can naturally say that certain works are not masterpieces, or not representative, or have lost their contemporary social significance due to the passage of time, or because the "theme" is not positive or the "political content" is not strong, etc., and do not need to be included. Some are indeed based on serious considerations, while others are influenced by certain "standards" of publishers.

    A selector, an author, a translator can compile poetry and prose according to certain criteria, and perhaps this compilation is very beneficial, or necessary in terms of certain practical conditions. We cannot oppose "anthologies" across the board. However, if masterpieces are given way due to personal preference, biased literary views, or temporary trends, it is worth considering carefully. Readers do not only love the limbs, but also the hair. Moreover, what is left out may not just be hair, and even hair has its value. Readers often want to regard their favorite authors as confidants, and see how they came to be—how they went from immaturity to maturity, experiencing many twists and turns, brightness and darkness, high mountains and shallow rivers. They very much hope to "get a glimpse of the whole picture."

    Speaking of this, I would like to quote a very meaningful passage from Mr. Lu Xun. He said:

    "If you are just playing around, then any anthology will do, the Literary Selections or the Guwen Guanzhi will also do. However, if you want to study literature or a certain writer, so-called 'understanding the person and discussing the era,' then it is very difficult to find an anthology that can be applied. What the anthology shows is often not the characteristics of the author, but the vision of the selector. The sharper the vision, the deeper and broader the knowledge, the more accurate the anthology will naturally be, but unfortunately, most of them have limited vision, obliterating the truth of the author, which is a 'literary catastrophe.' … If there is selection, then it is not the whole person, and if there is further emphasis or suppression, then it is even further from the truth." (Essays Written in a False Liberty: "Title Undecided" Draft Six)

    What Mr. Lu Xun criticized is certainly not exactly the same as our current situation, but it must be taken as a warning. Literature is not a short-lived phenomenon, but a deep-rooted and long-flowing undertaking, and we should plan for the long term. Moreover, some works require long-term appraisal by the social masses. In short, good anthologies are certainly needed, but at the same time, we should also solemnly publish more complete collections of poetry and prose (or publish them in separate volumes one after another), which is beneficial to the overall cultural development.

### 谈“选本”

    谈“选本”
    齐士
    我有时仿佛感到，我们现在又到了一个“选本”的时代了。走进书店，便可以看到各种各样的选本，但是想找一套比较完整的全集，可就比较难了。
    所以出选本，可能有各种各样的理由。譬如选本可以节约纸张，照顾读者的购买力和他们读书的时间和精力。这可能都是出于一片善心。选家们、作者们或者翻译家们自然也可以说，某些作品不算精品，或非代表之作，或因时过境迁已失其时代的社会的意义，或因“主题”不积极或“政治性”不强，等等，可以不必入选。有的的确是出于认真的严肃的考虑，而有的却由于出版家们的某种“标准”的影响。
    一个选家，一个作者，一个翻译家，可以根据一定的准则编选诗文，也许这种编选是很有益的，或就某种现实条件来说是必要的。我们不能一概反对“选本”。但是如果由于一己之好，文艺观点的偏颇，或因一时风尚所趋，而使精品让位，可就值得斟酌了。读者倒是不只喜爱肢体，也喜爱毛发，况且所遗者未必就是毛发，而且即使毛发也还有毛发的价值。读者常想把他所喜爱的作者引为知己，看看他是怎样走过来的——怎样地从不成熟到成熟，经历了多少曲直、明暗、高山、浅川，他们很希望“得窥全豹”。
    说到这里，我倒很愿意引述一下鲁迅先生的一段极有意义的话。他说：
    “如果随便玩玩，那是什么选本都可以的，文选好，古文观止也可以。不过倘要研究文学或某一作家，所谓‘知人论世’，那么，足以应用的选本就很难得。选本所显示的，往往并非作者的特色，倒是选者的眼光。眼光愈锐利，见识愈深广，选本固然愈准确，但可惜的是大抵眼光如豆，抹杀了作者真相的居多，这才是一个‘文人浩劫’。……倘有取舍，即非全人，再加抑扬，更离真实。”（且介亭杂文二集：“题未定”草之六）
    鲁迅先生所指摘的，当然和我们现在的情况不尽相同，但是却不可不引以为鉴。文学不是短暂的现象，而是源深流长的事业，我们应该打算得长远一点。而且，有些作品，需要社会的群众的长期的鉴定。总之，好的选本当然是需要的，但同时也应该郑重地多出一些诗文全集（或分单册陆续出版），这就整个的文化发展来说，是有好处的。
