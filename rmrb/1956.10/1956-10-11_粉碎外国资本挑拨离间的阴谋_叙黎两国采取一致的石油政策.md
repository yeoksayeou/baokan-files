    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 9th Dispatch: Syrian Prime Minister Sabri al-Asali said that Syria and Lebanon have adopted a unified policy on oil issues.

    Prime Minister Asali made these remarks in response to the "Iraq Petroleum Company's" decision to build a new oil pipeline to the Syrian port of Baniyas, instead of, as originally planned, to the Lebanese port of Tripoli. The "Iraq Petroleum Company" made this decision because of disagreements between it and the Lebanese government after Lebanon promulgated a decree to levy taxes on foreign companies. According to Damascus press circles, the "Iraq Petroleum Company's" decision is an attempt to split the unity of the Arab countries.

    Prime Minister Asali told reporters from "Al-Nasr" newspaper: "The Syrian government will never take any measures that would harm Arab countries, and will never agree to move the oil pipeline from Lebanon to Syria."

    In addition, according to Beirut news, Lebanese Minister of State Saeb Salam said that Lebanese and Syrian officials will hold a meeting soon to discuss oil issues.

    粉碎外国资本挑拨离间的阴谋
    叙黎两国采取一致的石油政策
    新华社9日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总理萨布里·阿萨利说，叙利亚和黎巴嫩在石油问题上采取一致的政策。
    阿萨利总理这些话是针对“伊拉克石油公司”决定建筑通往叙利亚港口巴尼亚斯的新输油管，而不像原先计划那样把输油管通往黎巴嫩港口的黎波里。“伊拉克石油公司”采取这个决定是由于黎巴嫩颁布了向外国公司收税的法令以后，它和黎巴嫩政府之间产生分歧而引起的。据大马士革的新闻界人士指出，“伊拉克石油公司”的决定是企图分裂阿拉伯国家的团结一致。
    阿萨利总理告诉“胜利报”记者：“叙利亚政府决不会采取危害阿拉伯国家的任何措施，并且决不同意把输油管从黎巴嫩移往叙利亚。”
    另外，据贝鲁特消息，黎巴嫩国务部长赛布·萨拉姆说，黎巴嫩和叙利亚的官员们将很快举行会议来讨论石油问题。
