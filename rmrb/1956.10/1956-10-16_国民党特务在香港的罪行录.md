Hong Kong's "Wen Wei Po" reported on the 13th about the atrocities committed by Kuomintang secret agents in Hong Kong since 1947.

In the summer of 1947, Kuomintang secret agents first bombed the Luk Hoi Tung Hotel in Central, Hong Kong. Shortly after this, the Hong Kong Ko Shing Theatre, Nam Ping Hotel, Golden Dragon and Tai Tung Restaurants, and even the British police station in Yau Ma Tei, Kowloon, successively experienced incidents of intimidation, extortion, and explosions. It was later discovered that the "Haiqing Faction" who committed these atrocities were in essence assistants of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, a US-Chiang Kai-shek secret service agency, "cadres" of the Kuomintang secret service chiefs Dai Li and Tao Yishan, and secret agents trained by American military instructors. Similar incidents occurred one after another, causing panic among Hong Kong residents and posing a great threat to their lives and property.

Kuomintang secret agents not only extorted and robbed innocent compatriots in Hong Kong, but also carried out planned killings and arson. Hong Kong compatriots remember two cases of murder and arson that occurred in 1949. One was on the evening of September 7, when the Kuomintang secret service in Hong Kong planned and blew up the "Ze Sheng" steamer, killing thirteen staff members. The ship burned and sank in the explosion. The other was on the same day, when Kuomintang secret agents brazenly shot and killed General Yang Jie, who was living in Hong Kong at the time, in a busy downtown area. Since these incidents, the blood debts created by secret agents placed in Hong Kong by the Kuomintang secret service have continued to occur.

On April 2, 1950, Kuomintang secret agents once again caused an explosion in Hong Kong, damaging seven aircraft belonging to our country's property under the China and Central Aviation Corporations. This case remains unsolved, and the perpetrators are still at large.

Shortly after the aircraft bombing incident, Kuomintang secret agents, led by an American named Arno, brandished sharp weapons and raided the Mong Kok typhoon shelter on June 12 and 13 of the same year, seizing the four insurgent fishing boats "Yu Jin," "Yu Yang," "Yu Lian," and "Yu Pu," which were the property of the Chinese people. On October 9, a time bomb was used to damage the insurgent "Hai Xia" steamer belonging to the China Merchants Bureau, killing Tang Daya and Lu Baoren on the spot.

Kuomintang secret agents also used Hong Kong to carry out the looting of merchant ships. On August 12, 1951, the freighter "Cape Comorin," flying the Panamanian flag and sailing from Hong Kong to Japan, was attacked 50 miles from Hong Kong when eight Kuomintang secret agents hidden on board emerged from the coal bunker, shot and killed a crew member, Huang Shu, and threw his body into the sea to cover up the crime. They then detained the captain, Hu De, and hijacked the ship to Taiwan. A year after this incident, another vessel flying the Panamanian flag, the "Nylandia," was hijacked to Taiwan by armed Kuomintang secret agents hidden on board while en route from Hong Kong to Japan.

The Hong Kong British authorities' Police Department annual report for 1952, when discussing the disruptive behavior of Kuomintang secret agents in Hong Kong, pointed out that many of the disturbances that occurred in the Sham Shui Po district of Kowloon on the anniversary of the 1911 Revolution in 1952 were organized by secret agents directed by the Taiwan Kuomintang secret service. This report revealed: Based on the situation of the disturbances at the time, it was clear that these Kuomintang secret agents had planned large-scale actions, which were likely to cause widespread and serious disturbances. In recent years, most of the large-scale arms cache cases uncovered in Hong Kong have been related to Kuomintang secret agents. In a large-scale arms cache case uncovered on January 4, 1956, the gun stocks and grips that were seized were marked with the words "U.S. Property." These weapons and highly explosive materials were all shipped from Taiwan to Hong Kong for illegal activities.

Especially serious is the Kuomintang secret service's plan to sabotage the Indian "Kashmir Princess" airliner on April 11 last year, killing personnel attending the Asian-African Conference and Chinese and foreign journalists covering the conference. The culprits have still not been brought to justice.

Hong Kong residents clearly remember the atrocities committed by Kuomintang secret agents every year on the anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution. Every year on this day, the secret agents would lead mobs in an organized and planned manner to create a series of disturbances in the urban areas of Hong Kong and Kowloon.

For nearly ten years, Hong Kong has remained a hotbed for Kuomintang secret agents, and Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots continue to suffer from the terrorist threats of these agents, with their personal safety and property unprotected. (Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th) (Attached pictures)

### 国民党特务在香港的罪行录

    国民党特务在香港的罪行录
    香港“文汇报”13日报道了国民党特务分子1947年以来在香港所制造的暴行。
    1947年夏天，国民党特务分子第一次用炸弹爆炸了香港中环陆海通旅店。在这以后不久，香港的高升戏院、南屏酒店、金龙和大同酒家甚至九龙油麻地的英方警署也连续发生了恐吓勒索和爆炸事件，事后查出，制造这些暴行的“海青派”，实质上就是美蒋特务机关“中美合作所”的助手，是国民党特务头子戴笠和陶一珊的“干部”，也是美国军事教官负责训练出来的特务。类似的事件层出不穷，使得香港居民人心惶惶，生命财产受到极大的威胁。
    国民党特务分子不但向香港善良的同胞勒索、抢劫，并且还有计划地进行杀人放火的勾当。香港同胞记得在1949年，发生了两宗杀人放火事件。一宗是在9月7日晚上，国民党在香港的特务机关有计划地爆炸了“泽生”号轮船，十三名工作人员被炸枉死，这个轮船在爆炸中焚烧沉没。另一宗是在同日，国民党特务分子在光天化日的热闹市区枪杀了当时住在香港的杨杰将军。自这些事件发生后，被国民党特务机构安置在香港的特务分子所制造的血案就不断发生。
    1950年4月2日国民党特务分子又一次在香港制造了爆炸事件，把七架属于我国财产的中国、中央两个航空公司的飞机炸坏，这个事件至今仍未破案，罪犯仍然逍遥法外。
    炸坏飞机的事件发生后不久，国民党特务分子又在同年6月12日和13日，在白昼手持利器，由一个叫阿诺的美国人率领着跑到旺角避风塘去劫夺，属于中国人民财产的四艘起义渔船“渔晋”、“渔扬”，“渔连”和“渔浦”号。10月9日，又用计时炸弹炸坏了起义的属于招商局的“海厦”轮，船上人员唐达雅和陆宝仁当场被炸死。
    国民党特务分子还利用香港来进行抢劫商船的勾当。1951年8月12日，一艘从香港开往日本的悬巴拿马旗的货轮“凯北利”号，在离开香港五十哩后，八个潜伏在船上的国民党特务分子从煤仓中走出，枪杀了船上人员黄树，并将他的尸体抛入海中灭迹，然后拘禁船长胡德，把船劫往台湾。这事发生后一年，另一艘悬巴拿马旗的“年达”号轮，又在从香港开往日本途中，被潜伏船上的国民党武装特务劫到台湾去。
    香港英国当局警务处发表的1952年年报中，说到国民党特务在香港捣乱行为时已指出，1952年辛亥革命纪念日在九龙深水埗区发生的许多纷扰，是由台湾国民党特务机关指挥的特务分子所组织的。这个年报透露：根据当时的捣乱情形来看，显然是这些国民党特务已计划了大规模的行动，很可能引起很普遍的严重纷扰。近几年来，香港所破获的大规模藏械案，也绝大部分和国民党特务分子有关。1956年1月4日破获的一次大规模藏械案，被搜出的枪架枪柄上都有“美国财产”字样，这批武器和烈性爆炸物都是从台湾运来香港，用来进行非法活动的。
    尤其严重的是国民党特务机关策划在去年4月11日破坏了印度“克什米尔公主”号航机，杀害我出席亚非会议人员和采访这一会议的中外记者，凶手也仍然未归案法办。
    香港居民都清楚记得国民党特务分子在每年辛亥革命纪念日所干下的暴行，每到这天，特务们便有组织有计划地率领暴徒在港九市区制造一连串的捣乱事件。
    将近十年了，香港仍然是国民党特务分子的温床，港九同胞仍然遭受这次特务的恐怖威胁，人身安全和财产失去保障。			     （新华社广州15日电）（附图片）
