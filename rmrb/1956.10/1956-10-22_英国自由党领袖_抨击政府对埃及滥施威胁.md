Xinhua News Agency, London, October 20th (TASS): British Liberal Party Chairman Beddowes stated in a speech in Gloucester on the 19th that the British government's policy on the Suez Canal issue contained serious consequences. He said that since Britain had signed the United Nations Charter, it had promised to renounce the threat or use of force in international relations. Beddowes said: "However, whenever Eden or Lloyd talk about the Suez Canal, they are always making threats, either explicitly or implicitly."

Lord Rea, leader of the Liberal Party group in the House of Lords, also criticized the government's policy on the Suez Canal issue in a speech in Birmingham. He emphasized that the use of force against Egypt was unacceptable.

    英国自由党领袖
    抨击政府对埃及滥施威胁
    新华社20日讯　塔斯社伦敦20日讯：英国自由党主席贝伦斯19日在格罗斯特发表演说的时候说，英国政府在苏伊士问题上的政策蕴藏着严重的后果。他说，英国既然在联合国宪章上签了字，那它就是已经允诺在国际关系中放弃武力威胁和使用武力。贝伦斯说：“可是，每当艾登或者是劳埃德谈到苏伊士运河的时候，总是或明或暗地在进行威胁。”
    自由党上院议会党团领袖劳德利在伯明翰发表演说的时候也批评政府对苏伊士问题的政策。他强调指出，对埃及实行武力政策是不可容忍的。
