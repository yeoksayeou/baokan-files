    Autumn Cocoon Harvest
    Liaoning's Autumn Tussah Cocoons Exceed Highest Historical Output
    Liaoning Province, which has historically been the leading producer of tussah cocoons in the country, is experiencing an unprecedented bumper harvest of autumn tussah cocoons this year. According to estimates from the Provincial Department of Agriculture, the province's 137,000 *jianzi* of autumn tussah silkworms (one *jianzi* represents a rearing area of 60 *mu*) can produce an average of about 65,000 cocoons per *jianzi*, an increase of 11,000 cocoons over the highest historical output. The province's total autumn cocoon production will reach over 9 billion cocoons, an increase of over 2.4 billion cocoons compared to 1952, the year with the highest output since liberation.
    This year, because silkworm farmers in various regions have achieved cooperativization, rearing techniques have been significantly improved, and many regions have also seen many new large-scale bumper harvest records that have never been seen before. For example, the 25,000 *jianzi* of autumn tussah silkworms reared by farmers in岫岩 (Xiuyan) County, half of them can produce 100,000 cocoons per *jianzi*.
    Now, silkworm-rearing cooperatives in various regions have generally begun to harvest cocoons, and are actively selecting good cocoons to sell to the state to support the production of the silk industry.
    Sichuan's New Sericulture Areas Exceed Autumn Silkworm Cocoon Production Plan
    In the newly developed sericulture areas of Sichuan Province, the six counties of遂宁 (Suining), 安岳 (Anyue), and 乐至 (Lezhi) in the遂宁 (Suining) Prefecture saw a bumper harvest of autumn silkworms for the first time this year, reared on a large scale by 2,139 agricultural cooperatives. All counties have exceeded their cocoon production plans, with an average cocoon production of over 46 *jin* per silkworm card, exceeding the average unit yield of the entire prefecture in the years since liberation.
    Among the nine counties under the jurisdiction of遂宁 (Suining) Prefecture, only three counties, including三台 (Santai), have a longer history of mulberry cultivation and silkworm rearing. With the development of the agricultural cooperation movement, farmers in the other six counties have begun to cultivate seedlings, plant mulberry trees, and develop silkworm rearing as a sideline occupation in the past two years. Relevant departments have provided them with assistance in various aspects. All six counties have established sericulture technical guidance stations (groups).
    The bumper harvest of autumn cocoons has increased the income of many agricultural cooperatives. For example, the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative in仙鹤 (Xianhe) Township, 乐至 (Lezhi) County, earned 1,530 yuan from silkworm rearing for the first time this year.
    Improved Autumn Silkworms Promoted in Hubei Can Produce 30 *jin* of Cocoons Per Silkworm Card
    Hubei Province successfully promoted improved autumn silkworms for the first time. The Provincial State-owned Silk Company has purchased a large number of autumn cocoons and native silk reeled from autumn cocoons, with a total purchase value of more than 400,000 yuan.
    In the past, farmers in Hubei Province did not have the habit of rearing autumn silkworms. This year, in order to help members of agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas increase their income, the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture promoted more than 16,000 improved silkworm cards on the basis of successful trial rearing last year. According to estimates from the Provincial Department of Agriculture, the 20 counties in the province promoting autumn silkworms can produce an average of more than 30 *jin* of cocoons per silkworm card.

    秋茧丰收
    辽宁秋柞蚕茧超过历来最高产量
    历年柞蚕茧产量占全国第一位的辽宁省，今年秋季柞蚕茧空前丰收。据省农业厅估计，全省十三万七千多把剪子秋柞蚕（一把剪子的放养面积为六十亩），平均每把剪子可以产茧六万五千粒左右，比历史上的最高产量增加一万一千粒。全省秋茧总产量将达到九十多亿粒，比解放后产量最高的1952年增加二十四亿多粒。
    由于今年各地养蚕农民实现了合作化，放养技术有了显著改进，很多地区还出现了不少从未有过的大面积丰产新纪录。如岫岩县农民放养的二万五千把剪子秋柞蚕，其中有一半每把剪子的产茧量可以达到十万粒。
    现在各地养蚕的合作社已经普遍开始收茧，并且积极挑选好茧准备卖给国家，支援丝绸工业生产。
    四川新蚕桑区秋蚕超额完成产茧计划
    四川省新发展的蚕桑区遂宁专区的遂宁、安岳、乐至等六个县，今年二千一百三十九个农业社第一次大量饲养的秋蚕丰收。各县都超额完成了产茧计划，平均每张蚕种产茧四十六斤多，超过全专区解放后历年的平均单位产量。
    遂宁专区所辖的九个县中，仅三台等三个县栽桑养蚕历史较久。随着农业合作化运动的发展，其他六个县的农民在最近两年来开始育苗栽桑，发展养蚕副业。有关部门对他们作了多方面的帮助。这六个县都设立了蚕桑技术指导站（组）。
    秋茧丰收，许多农业社因而增加了收入。如乐至县仙鹤乡红星农业社今年第一次养蚕，就收入一千五百三十元。
    湖北推广的改良秋蚕每张蚕种可产茧三十斤
    湖北省第一次推广秋季改良蚕成功。省国营丝绸公司已经收购了大量秋茧和秋茧缫成的土丝，收购的总值达四十多万元。
    湖北省农民往年没有饲养秋蚕的习惯。湖北省农业部门今年为了帮助山区农业社社员增加收入，在去年试养成功的基础上，推广了一万六千多张改良蚕种。据省农业部门估计，全省推广秋蚕的二十个县，平均每张蚕种可产茧三十斤以上。　（均新华社讯）
