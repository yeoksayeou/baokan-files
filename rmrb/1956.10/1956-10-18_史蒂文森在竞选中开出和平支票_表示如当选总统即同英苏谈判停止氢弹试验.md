    Xinhua News Agency, October 17th, Chicago Dispatch: U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson told American television and radio audiences on the evening of October 15th that if he were elected president, his first order of business would be to seek "through any level of meeting or consultation, held anywhere," to formulate an agreement with the Soviet Union and Britain to halt hydrogen bomb tests.

    Stevenson said, "The urgent thing is to formulate a global policy to stop these tests as soon as possible."

    Stevenson pointed out, "Russia and Britain have both stated their willingness to work with us to formulate the kind of policy I am suggesting." He asked, "What are we waiting for now?"

    Stevenson said, "We should seize the time to take full advantage of the better atmosphere that seems to be making progress in this area."

    "Therefore, if I am elected president, I think the first thing to do is to seize the opportunity now offered by other atomic nations. I will do so through meetings or consultations—whatever level, wherever held—when the situation seems most productive."

    But he also said that the United States should continue to produce hydrogen weapons and further study hydrogen weapons. He believes that stopping hydrogen bomb tests would not weaken the military strength of the United States.

    史蒂文森在竞选中开出和平支票
    表示如当选总统即同英苏谈判停止氢弹试验
    新华社17日讯　芝加哥消息：美国民主党总统候选人史蒂文森10月15日晚上对美国的电视和无线电听众说：如果他当选为总统，他的第一件公事就要设法“通过不论在任何地方举行的任何一级会议或协商”来同苏联和英国拟订一个协定来制止氢弹试验。
    史蒂文森说，“尽早制定一种制止这些试验的世界性政策是迫不及待的事情”。
    史蒂文森指出，“俄国和英国都已声明它们愿意同我们一起设法制定我建议的这种政策。”他问道：“我们现在还在等待甚么？”
    史蒂文森说，“我们应当抓紧时间来充分利用那种似乎是在这方面取得进展的比较好的气氛”。
    “因此，如果我当选为总统的话，我认为第一件要做的事情就是要抓紧其他原子国家现在所提供的机会。我将在情况令人觉得收效最大的时候通过会议或协商——不论是甚么一级，不论在甚么地方举行——来这样做。”
    但是他又说，美国仍然应当继续生产氢武器和进一步研究氢武器。他认为，这样，停止氢弹试验并不会削弱美国的军事力量。
