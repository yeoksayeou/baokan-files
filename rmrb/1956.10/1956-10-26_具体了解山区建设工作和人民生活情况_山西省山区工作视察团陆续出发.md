Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 23rd - The Mountain Area Work Inspection Group jointly organized by the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee set off from Taiyuan today in five routes to inspect the Taihang, Taiyue and other mountain areas and old revolutionary base areas.
The inspection group is led by Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Wei Heng, Acting Governor of Shanxi Province, among others. Participants include leading cadres from the departments and bureaus of the Provincial People's Committee, experienced cadres from provincial and special district agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, soil and water conservation, finance, and trade departments, as well as technical and professional personnel, totaling more than 300 people.

This inspection group will spend twenty to thirty days delving into the mountain areas throughout the province to specifically understand the construction work in the mountain areas and the living conditions of the people in the mountain areas. The inspection group also carried a batch of relief funds and led five rural film projection teams to extend their regards to the people in the mountain areas.

More than 70% of Shanxi Province is mountainous. Since liberation, the state has carried out many cultural, health, and transportation projects in the mountainous areas, and the living standards of the people in the mountainous areas have also been initially improved. However, due to the relatively poor natural economic conditions here, the living conditions of the people in the mountainous areas are still relatively poor. After the First Congress of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed strengthening the work in the mountainous areas in July this year, the provincial, special district, and county levels generally established mountain area production planning offices, and some areas also organized visiting groups to visit the mountain areas. In order to support mountain farmers in developing production and improving their material and cultural living standards, agricultural taxes in poor mountain areas were appropriately reduced, and the purchase prices of eight kinds of livestock products were increased successively, and the regional price differences for twenty-nine kinds of small livestock products were eliminated. This inspection group will further listen to the opinions of the people in the mountainous areas, conduct on-the-spot investigations of the specific conditions of various types of mountainous areas, and draft new plans for the construction of mountainous areas in Shanxi Province and the improvement of people's living standards.

    具体了解山区建设工作和人民生活情况
    山西省山区工作视察团陆续出发
    新华社太原23日电　由中共山西省委员会、山西省人民委员会联合组织的山区工作视察团，今天陆续从太原出发。他们分五路到太行、太岳等山区和革命老根据地进行视察。
    视察团由中共山西省委员会第一书记陶鲁笳和山西省代理省长卫恒等率领。参加的有省人民委员会厅、局领导干部、省和专区的农林水利、水土保持和财经贸易部门富有山区工作经验的干部以及技术、专业人员共三百多人。
    这个视察团将以二十到三十天的时间深入全省山区具体了解山区建设工作和山区人民的生活状况。视察团还携带了一批救济款，率领了五个农村电影放映队，将对山区人民进行慰问。
    山西省70％以上地区是山区。解放以来，国家曾在山区进行了许多文化、卫生和交通等方面建设，山区人民生活水平也有初步改善，但是由于这里的自然经济条件较差，目前山区人民的生活仍然比较贫困。今年7月间，中共山西省第一次代表大会提出加强山区工作以后，省、专区和县普遍成立了山区生产规划办公室，有些地区还组织了访问团到山区访问；并且开始为扶植山区农民发展生产和提高他们的物质文化生活水平，适当地降低了贫瘠山区的农业税，先后提高八种畜产品的收购价格，取消了二十九种小畜产品的地区差价。这次组织的视察团，将进一步深入听取山区人民的意见，实地考察各类山区的具体条件，拟就山西省山区建设和改善人民生活的新方案。
