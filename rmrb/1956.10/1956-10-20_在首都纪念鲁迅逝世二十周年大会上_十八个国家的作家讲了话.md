Xinhua News Agency, October 19th: At the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death held in the capital, writers from eighteen countries who were invited to participate in the conference all delivered speeches.

    Burmese writer U Thaw Pe Myint said that the Burmese people love Mr. Lu Xun's works. In the process of building our new Burma, we will take Mr. Lu Xun as an example to undertake our literary tasks. Mr. Lu Xun used his pen to support international friendship and the cause of striving for peace. We will, like Mr. Lu Xun, do our best to consolidate friendship and peace.

    Yugoslav writer Ivo Andrić said, may this conference commemorating the great revolutionary fighter and writer Lu Xun serve as a new impetus for further and broader cooperation between China and Yugoslavia in the cultural field. May this cooperation blossom and bear fruit in the cultural development and socialist construction of our two countries and be beneficial to both of us.

    Albanian writer Sterjo Spasse said that the characters in Lu Xun's novels also possess the hearts, souls, and anxieties of ordinary Albanians. Oppressed and inhumanly exploited farm laborers like Ah Q in "The True Story of Ah Q," or pitiful intellectuals like Kong Yiji in "Kong Yiji," and thousands of other characters in Lu Xun's novels, also existed in Albania during the era of the feudal bourgeois system. He said that now, in our country, as in your country, there is no longer soil that can produce such unfortunate people.

    Polish writer Jerzy Putrament said that Lu Xun's unparalleled cultivation of his motherland's cultural traditions, his acute sensitivity to the moral problems of his time, and his indomitable fighting spirit made him one of the world's great writers. He said, I hope that in the country I am visiting and in the countries we come from, some writers will emerge whose life goals are as firm as Lu Xun's, whose character is as firm as Lu Xun's, and whose skills are as adept as Lu Xun's.

    Japanese writer Chō Yorichika talked about his experience of meeting Lu Xun in Shanghai in May 1935. He said that at first glance, one could tell that he was an extraordinary person. He believed that Mr. Lu Xun would be happy if he saw today's China's almost otherworldly brilliant development.

    Bulgarian writer Nikola Marinov said that today, Lu Xun has become our common brother, colleague, and mentor. We, the Bulgarian people, should sincerely thank Lu Xun because he was the first Chinese writer to introduce Bulgarian literature to the progressive circles of China.

    Korean writer Han Sorya said that twenty years have passed since Lu Xun's death, but Mr. Lu Xun's advanced literature and his revolutionary spirit not only live on to this day in the period of socialist transformation in New China, but will continue to live on. At the same time, it will also have a huge impact and play a significant role in the revolutionary development of Korea.

    Romanian writer Auez Mihal said that Lu Xun is the new pioneer of 20th-century Chinese literature and realism. The Chinese and the world's millions of ordinary people will never forget this person who thought and described their lives, their joys and sorrows, and their future with such confidence and enthusiasm.

    Australian writer Dymphna Cusack said that there is a world of difference between the society Lu Xun described and the society I grew up in and am trying to reflect in my writing. But when I read Lu Xun's works, I feel no obstacles. Although the ocean separates us, our thoughts are the same. She said that the seawater washing your shores and our shores belongs to the same ocean—the Pacific. Peace means peace, and I know that the people gathered here today all have a common hope that the Pacific will indeed always be a sea of peace.

    Italian writer Curzio Malaparte said that for Lu Xun, for the glory of his life and his works, we should work to defend freedom, justice, and peace, and also for the spiritual and cultural unity of Europe and the world. He said that here, in the capital of New China, it is already felt that the moral and cultural unity of the world is not just a hope, it is a living reality.

    Mongolian writer Choyjilsüren Erheemsüren said that the name Lu Xun has become a respectable and lovely heroic title in the hearts of peace-loving people all over the world. This is because Lu Xun grew up in the midst of the people's lives and struggles. He used all his energy to sing the praises of the people's glorious labor and heroic struggles. He waged an indomitable fight for the people's better life, freedom, and happiness.

    Hungarian writer Szamiiel György said that Lu Xun was the first to translate the poems of the Hungarian poet Petőfi into his native language. He linked the hearts of the people of China and Hungary before there were trains and planes between the two countries. He said that Lu Xun's influence is growing in Hungary, and we need Lu Xun's words as much as we need the words of any great figure in the world.

    Czechoslovakian writer Jan Šlechta said that Lu Xun revived dead fire not only in literature but also in life, in the work of thinkers and revolutionaries. Today, this fire is burning brightly throughout China. He said, please allow us to come closer to this flame and warm ourselves. May its light illuminate our common cause of peace. May all this further strengthen the friendship between China and Czechoslovakia.

    在首都纪念鲁迅逝世二十周年大会上
    十八个国家的作家讲了话
    据新华社19日讯　在首都举行的鲁迅先生逝世二十周年纪念大会上，应邀参加大会的十八个国家的作家都讲了话。
    缅甸作家吴登佩密说，缅甸人民喜爱鲁迅先生的作品。在建设我们新缅甸的过程中我们将以鲁迅先生为榜样担负起我们的文学任务。鲁迅先生用他的笔杆支持国际友好和争取和平的事业，我们将和鲁迅先生一样尽我们最大的力量为巩固友谊与和平而努力。
    南斯拉夫作家伊伏·安得利奇说，愿这次纪念伟大的革命战士和作家鲁迅的大会，作为中南两国在文化上进一步更广泛地合作的新的动力。愿这一合作在中南两国文化发展上和社会主义建设方面开花结果和对我们两国有益。
    阿尔巴尼亚作家斯捷利奥·斯巴赛说，鲁迅小说中的人物也有着普通的阿尔巴尼亚人的心、灵魂和忧虑。像“阿Q正传”小说中阿Q这样的受压迫和惨无人道地受剥削的雇农，或者是像“孔乙己”小说中孔乙己这样可怜的知识分子和鲁迅小说中的数以千计的其他人物，当阿尔巴尼亚在封建资产阶级制度的时代下也同样产生着。他说，现在，在我们的国家里，同在你们的国家里一样，再也没有会产生这种不幸者的土壤了。
    波兰作家魏得志说，由于鲁迅对祖国的文化传统有着无比的修养，对他的时代的道德问题的尖锐的感受，再加上他的不屈不挠的战斗精神，这就使他成为世界伟大作家中的一个。他说，我希望在我来作客的国家里以及我们来自的国家里，都能产生一些作家来，他们人生的目的和鲁迅一样的坚定，他们的性格和鲁迅一样刚毅，他们的技巧和鲁迅一样娴熟。
    日本作家长与善郎谈到他在1935年5月在上海认识鲁迅的经过。他说，一眼看去，就知道这是一位不平凡的人。他相信鲁迅先生如果看到今天中国这样的恍若隔世般的辉煌发展，一定会高兴的。
    保加利亚作家尼古拉·马里诺夫说，今天，鲁迅成了我们共同的兄弟、同事和导师。我们，保加利亚人民，应该衷心地感谢鲁迅，因为他是第一个向中国进步阶层介绍了保加利亚文学的中国作家。
    朝鲜作家韩雪野说，鲁迅逝世已经二十年了，但是鲁迅先生的先进文学和他的革命精神不仅活到今天新中国进行社会主义改造的时期，而且还要继续活下去。同时，对于朝鲜的革命发展，也将发生巨大的影响和起巨大的作用。
    罗马尼亚作家阿乌埃勒·米哈尔说，鲁迅是二十世纪中国文学和现实主义的新的开路人。中国和世界千千万万的普通人民永远不会忘记这一位以这样的信心和热情来思考、来描写他们的生活，他们的欢乐和愁苦以及他们的未来的人。
    澳大利亚作家迪姆芙娜·古沙克说，鲁迅所描写的社会和我所生长以及努力要在我的写作里反映出来的社会之间有着天渊之别。但是当我阅读鲁迅的作品时，我感到没有任何障碍。虽然海洋把我们分开了，我们的思想是一致的。她说，冲洗着你们的海岸和我们的海岸的海水属于同一个大洋——太平洋。太平意味着和平，我知道今天聚会在这里的人们都有一个共同的希望，就是太平洋事实上将永远是一个和平的海洋。
    意大利作家马拉帕脱说，为了鲁迅，为了他一生的光辉和他的著作，我们应该工作，为保卫自由、正义与和平而工作，同样也为欧洲和全世界的精神和文化的团结而工作。他说，在这里，在新中国的首都，已经感觉到全世界的道德和文化的统一不仅是一个希望了，它是活的现实。
    蒙古作家乔然尔查文·尔哈木苏伦说，鲁迅这个名字在全世界爱好和平者的心目中，已经成为一个可敬可爱的英雄称号了。这是因为鲁迅生长在人民的生活和斗争的中间，他用自己全副的心血来歌颂了人民的光荣的劳动和英勇的斗争，他为了人民的美好生活，自由幸福，进行了不屈不挠的战斗。
    匈牙利作家萨米奥·乔治说，鲁迅是第一位把匈牙利的诗人裴多菲的诗译成他本国语言的，他在中国和匈牙利之间还没有通火车和飞机之前，就已经把两国人民的心联结起来了。他说鲁迅的影响在匈牙利正在日益扩大，我们需要鲁迅的话，正如需要世界上任何伟大人物的话一样。
    捷克斯洛伐克作家沙利·斯蒂芬说，鲁迅不但在文学里，并且也在生活里，在思想家和革命家的工作里，复活了死火。今天，这股烈火正熊熊地燃遍中国。他说，请允许我们也来靠近这个火焰，暖和自己。愿它的光亮照耀我们共同的和平事业。愿这一切更进一步地加强中捷两国的友谊。
