    Xinhua News Agency, 10th: New York dispatch: Representatives of the eighteen countries that participated in the second London conference held a meeting in New York on the 9th, presided over by British Foreign Secretary Lloyd. According to a British spokesperson, the purpose of this meeting was "to exchange information and maintain a consensus of opinion."

    According to Agence France-Presse, citing well-informed sources, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles stated at the meeting that the prompt establishment of a "Suez Canal Users Association" was "indispensable," and that this "association" would be "particularly useful" in the ongoing diplomatic negotiations.

    Xinhua News Agency, 11th: According to a "Al-Ahram" (Egyptian Newspaper) New York dispatch: The representatives of the Nordic countries and the Netherlands are extremely dissatisfied with the meeting of representatives of the eighteen London conference participating countries convened in New York on the 9th by the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and the United States. They believe that they were convened to exchange opinions on the Suez issue, not merely to listen to a report from the three major Western powers on the development of the situation.

    英法美又召开十八国会议
    北欧国家和荷兰很不满
    新华社10日讯　纽约消息：参加第二次伦敦会议的十八个国家的代表9日在英国外交大臣劳埃德主持下在纽约开了一个会。据英国发言人说，这次会议是“为了交换情报和保持意见的一致”。
    据法新社引消息灵通人士的话说，美国国务卿杜勒斯曾经在会上说，尽速组成“苏伊士运河使用国协会”是“不可或缺”的，这个“协会”在目前正在进行的外交谈判中是“特别有用”的。
    新华社11日讯　据埃及“金字塔报”纽约消息：北欧国家和荷兰代表对英法美三国外长9日在纽约召开的十八个伦敦会议参加国代表的会议极为不满。他们认为召集他们开会是来就苏伊士问题交换意见的，而不是仅仅来听取西方三大国关于事态发展的汇报。
