    Cannot Skimp on Disaster Relief for Victims
    Wuqiang County suffered an extremely serious flood disaster, and livestock feed is extremely scarce. After investigation, the agricultural cooperative has 979 old cattle that have lost their ability to work, of which about 100 have already died from illness and disability. Therefore, the agricultural cooperative urgently requests to sell this batch of old cattle. Comrade Su and three others from the Jiaocheng County Food Company arrived in Wuqiang on September 15, saying they came to purchase grass-fed cattle to support the disaster area. They immediately went to the Commercial Bureau to discuss the purchase price of the grass-fed cattle. They said: The purchase price of grass-fed cattle should not exceed 1 jiao 5 fen per jin at most (calculated by net meat weight). Comrade Liu of the Commercial Bureau, not knowing the reason at the time, approved the purchase. The four people from the food company rushed to the disaster area and inspected 70 old cattle in one trip. This matter was eventually discovered by the Party Committee, which immediately asked Comrade Su of the food company about the basis for the pricing. Comrade Su was dumbfounded when asked. He suddenly had a flash of inspiration and increased the price from 1 jiao 5 fen to 1 jiao 8 fen. He said firmly: I cannot increase it more than these 3 fen.
    We believe that purchasing at 1 jiao 8 fen is still unreasonable. This year in February, the purchase price in Wuqiang was 3 jiao 7 fen 9 per jin; the worst grade was 3 jiao 1 fen 5. In comparison, disaster victims lose more than 16 yuan for every 100 jin of beef they sell. This money can buy 200 jin of coarse grains, enough for six disaster victims to eat for a month.
    Currently, because the two sides have not agreed on the price issue, the Jiaocheng Food Company is unwilling to purchase. However, the problem of the disaster victims urgently needs to be resolved. It is hoped that the Special Commissioner's Office Commercial Bureau will mediate as soon as possible, based on the principles of supporting the disaster area and fair trade.

    不能克扣灾民
    武强县遭受了极其严重的洪水灾害，牲畜饲草极为缺乏。经调查农业社有九百七十九头失去劳力的老牛，其中已经病残而死的约一百余头，因而农业社迫切要求把这批老牛卖掉。交河县食品公司苏同志等一行四人于9月15日赶到了武强，说是为了支援灾区，特来收购菜牛的。当即到商业局研究菜牛收购价格，他们说：菜牛收价最多每斤不得超过一角五分（按净肉计算）。商业局的刘同志当时不明就里，批准收买。食品公司的四个人急忙跑到灾区，一趟就验上了老牛七十头。这件事终被党委察觉，立即找食品公司苏同志询问定价的根据。苏同志被问得目瞪口呆，他忽然灵机一动，从一角五分增加到一角八分。他斩钉截铁地说：再长这三分，就不能再长了。
    我们认为按一角八分收购，仍然不合理。今年2月份武强收购价每市斤三角七分九；等外最次的三角一分五。两相比较，灾民每卖牛肉一百斤，就吃亏十六元多钱，这些钱能买粗粮二百斤，够六个灾民吃一月的。
    现在因为双方对价格问题没有议妥，交河食品公司不肯收购。但灾民的问题却迫切需要解决。希望专署商业局，本着支援灾区和公平交易的原则，即早加以调解。
