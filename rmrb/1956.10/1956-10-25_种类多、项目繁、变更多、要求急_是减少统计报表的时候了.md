Issuing various statistical reports is for the sake of work. However, if we do not proceed from the actual situation and blindly issue reports indiscriminately, it will affect our work. The indiscriminate issuance of reports was once opposed as one of the "five excessive's" phenomena, because it is one of the manifestations of subjectivism and bureaucratism in our work. If we do not change this style, it will affect the rapid advancement of our cause.

Recently, some provinces and cities, through inspections of the handling of official documents in government offices, have discovered that many government offices, without considering the difficulties of lower levels, indiscriminately issue statistical reports, causing a flood of reports in many local government offices. According to inspections in Liaoning Province, the municipal and county industrial bureaus and sections, as well as their affiliated factories and mines, currently submit 107 types of regular reports to the Provincial Department of Industry. In Chengguan Central Township, Xingyang County, Henan Province, from January to May of this year, more than 140 types of statistical reports have been completed and submitted. Many departments request a large number of reports from below, but do not read or use them, and keep them locked in cabinets untouched. Some local government offices, due to the excessive number of reports issued by higher levels, have had their central work seriously affected. A clerk in Chengguan Central Township, Xingyang County, Henan Province, said that they often work day and night to fill out reports, and that he and the township head spend most of their time and energy filling out reports, sometimes even mobilizing all possible forces to work overtime day and night. How exactly is this situation of indiscriminate issuance of reports created?

First of all, the leading comrades of some departments do not pay enough attention to the work of issuing reports in their departments, and their control is not strict enough. There is a "better to issue than not to issue" mentality. As a result, reports that should not be issued are issued. The phenomenon of unauthorized issuance of reports without approval has become more prevalent again. According to inspections in Liaoning Province, more than 20 types of reports have been issued without authorization by various provincial departments alone. In addition, the agencies that approve reports do not exercise strict enough control over the reports. For example, the quality accident report formulated by the Hebei Provincial Bureau of Statistics and the quality accident report formulated by the former Urban Construction Bureau were both approved and issued by the State Statistical Bureau. The same reports have only two different items, but the lower levels have to fill them out separately. For example, the "Statistical Table of Deaths, Age, and Gender" issued by the Ministry of Health in April of this year is completely consistent with the "Statistical Table of Deaths and Age" issued by the Ministry of Public Security in January of this year. Due to lax control over approvals, there is duplication. This is one of the reasons for the large number and disorder of reports.

Secondly, some departments do not proceed from reality, do not consider needs and possibilities, and blindly issue reports based solely on subjective imagination. At the same time, the deadlines are too short and the requirements are too harsh, resulting in chaos and being overwhelmed with work at lower levels. The Grain Bureau of Xingyang County, Henan Province, issued a statistical table of grain unified sales figures, with as many as 136 items. After the reports were issued to the townships, none of the township cadres could understand them. The Grain Bureau summoned the clerks of each township to the county and explained them for two full days, but the township clerks still did not understand. It is conceivable how complicated this report was.

Finally, there is a lack of thorough consideration, supplementation, correction, and repeated changes. This creates rework and waste in the investigation and statistics work at lower levels. The Ministry of Public Security's statistics on the types of criminals are revised every year. In the first quarter of this year, various regions had already completed statistics according to two major categories, but the Ministry of Public Security notified on March 5 that statistics should be made according to 20 major categories, resulting in rework and waste. According to work needs, report items can and should of course be changed, but why not make the changes earlier? The former Third Ministry of Machine Building limited Jiangsu Province to make three copies of the report for each of the 1,700 or so factories with more than four people, requiring a total of more than 5,100 copies. If each person fills out eight copies a day, it would take ten people more than two months to fill them out. Later, the province managed to fill them out, but the ministry said it didn't need them. This kind of capricious and wasteful phenomenon is truly laughable. More changes and urgent requirements not only make work difficult at lower levels, but also have a great impact on the accuracy of statistical figures. A company manager said: "It's not that we deliberately make false reports, but the deadlines are so short that we have to be careless." In this case, although the materials are received on time, if they are used as the basis for formulating work plans, it will bring even greater losses to the entire work.

Understanding the situation and studying problems through statistical figures, as one of the bases for formulating policies, and work plans, is an important method in our work. The reasoning is indisputable. Issuing reports according to needs and possibilities is one thing, and blindly issuing reports indiscriminately without proceeding from the actual situation is another. In order to improve the work of issuing reports, when formulating reports, the purpose should be clear and the items should be as simple and concise as possible. Understand the difficulties of lower levels, do not conduct general surveys if you can conduct key surveys, do not conduct surveys now if you can conduct them in the future, do not conduct separate surveys if you can conduct unified surveys, do not ask for information from below that can be collected above, and do not be urgent if you can be slow. If we can do this, I think statistical reports can be greatly reduced.

    种类多、项目繁、变更多、要求急
    是减少统计报表的时候了
    江陵
    制发各种统计报表，是为了工作。但是如果不从实际情况出发，盲目地滥发报表，就会影响工作。滥发报表，在过去曾经当作“五多”现象之一反对过，因为它是在我们工作中主观主义、官僚主义的表现形式之一，不改掉这种作风，就会影响到我们的事业的迅速前进。
    最近，有些省、市通过对机关文书处理工作的检查，发现不少机关不考虑下级困难，滥发统计报表，致使很多地方机关报表泛滥成灾。据辽宁省检查，目前各市、县工业局、科及所属厂、矿，向省工业厅填报的定期报表，已有一百零七种。河南荥阳县城关中心乡，今年1月至5月份，已经填好上报了的各种统计报表，竟达一百四十多种。不少部门向下面要了很多报表，但是不看不用，原封不动地关进了橱柜。有些地方机关，由于上级发下去的报表太多，严重地影响了他们本单位的中心工作。河南荥阳县城关中心乡的文书说，他们常常夜以继日地为填写报表而忙碌，他和乡长的绝大部分的时间和精力，都是填写报表，甚至有时还得动员一切可能动员的力量，加班加点，日夜突击。这种滥发报表的情况，究竟是怎样造成的呢？
    首先是有些部门的领导同志，对于本部门制发报表的工作重视不够，控制不严，存在着一种“发了比不发好”的想法。其结果是不应该发的报表发了。不经批准，擅自制发报表的现象现在又多起来了。据辽宁省检查，仅省级各部门未经批准擅自制发的报表，约有二十多种。此外，审批报表的机关，对于报表的控制也不够严格。例如河北省统计局制定的质量事故报表，和前城市建设总局制定的质量事故报表，都是经过国家统计局批准下达的，同样的报表，只有两个项目之差，下面也得分别填报。又如卫生部今年4月间制发的“死亡人口、年龄、性别统计表”同公安部今年1月份制发的“死亡人口、年龄统计表”，要求完全一致。由于审批控制不严，形成彼此重复。这就是造成报表多和乱的原因之一。
    其次是有些部门不从实际出发，不考虑需要和可能，只凭主观想像，就盲目制发报表。同时限期太短，要求过苛，以致造成下面工作忙乱不堪，穷于应付。河南荥阳县粮食局制发了一种粮食统销数字表册，项目多达一百三十六个。报表发到各乡以后，乡干部个个看不懂，粮食局就把各乡文书召集到县，整整讲解了两天，结果各乡文书仍然不懂。可以设想得到，这个报表竟繁琐到何种程度。
    最后，就是考虑不周，补充修正，一再变更。这样，就造成了下面调查统计工作上的返工浪费。公安部关于案犯类型统计，年年改动。今年第一季度各地已按二大项统计好了，公安部又于3月5日通知按二十大项统计，造成返工浪费。根据工作需要，报表项目当然是可以而且应当改动，但为何不早作改动呢？前第三机械工业部限期要江苏省将四人以上的一千七百多个厂，每厂造表三份，共计需要造报五千一百多份，若以每人每日填写八张计算，需十人填写两个多月。后来省里设法填写好了，该部说不要了。这种朝三暮四，劳民伤财的现象，真是使人啼笑皆非。变更多，要求急，一方面使下面工作困难，另一方面，对于统计数字的精确性也影响很大。一个公司的经理同志说：“不是我们存心做假报告，限期如此之短，不得不马马虎虎。”在这种情况下，材料虽然如期到了手，但是如果以此作为制定工作计划的根据，那就会给整个工作带来更大的损失。
    通过统计数字，了解情况，研究问题，作为制定方针、政策和工作计划的依据之一，是我们工作中的一个重要方法。道理是无可争议的。根据需要与可能制发报表，与不从实际情况出发，盲目地滥发报表，是两回事情。为了改进制发报表的工作，在制定报表的时候，目的应当明确，项目应当力求简单扼要。体谅下面的困难，能作重点调查的不要普遍调查，能放在今后调查的不要现在调查，能统一调查的不要分散调查，能够在上面搜集到的不要向下面要。能缓的不要急。假如能做到这样的话，我想统计报表是可以大大减少的。
