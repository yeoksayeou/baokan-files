    Solving a Key Problem in Baotou's Supply Work
    By our reporter Liu Heng

    During my visit to Baotou, I heard many workers and their families reflecting that the supply work in Baotou was far from meeting the needs of the masses' lives. Among the workers, there were statements like: "Participating in the construction of the Baotou industrial base is glorious, but after being here for two or three months, we haven't had any pork." "It's too difficult to buy things! We have to walk five or six li, and stand in line for two or three hours. If we take care of buying groceries, we miss cooking meals." Some people even composed a folk song: "Lack of supply stations, oil, salt, rice, and noodles are inconvenient. Lack of barbershops, long hair is unsightly. It's hard to make clothes with money but no cloth, so we have to wear cotton clothes through the summer."

    Why does Baotou have this phenomenon? I specifically visited Comrade Lin Ke, Deputy Director of the Finance and Trade Department of the Baotou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. She told me:

    "This is because our Baotou has developed too quickly. Two years ago, Baotou was still a small city with only 90,000 people, but now it has more than 300,000 people. A new urban area is under construction dozens of li away from Baotou. At the beginning of last year, it was still a barren land, but now several large blocks of houses have been built. At that time, we estimated that one house would be occupied by at most one family. Who knew that houses are inanimate, but people are alive. Workers and their families continue to come, and two or three families live in one house. In this way, our estimated figures are too conservative!

    "Our Baotou is not only growing in population, but the people who are coming are all from big cities, with different living habits from the locals, and their purchasing power is also greater. However, we are used to doing things on a small scale, and we can't broaden our horizons, so we dare not buy more when purchasing.
    " 'Rather be out of stock than have inventory backlog' – this is our business philosophy. If there is a backlog, the higher-ups will criticize us. In January of this year, the Inner Mongolia Commercial Department sent a inspection team to check this point. But if we are out of stock, the higher-ups don't care, and the inspection team doesn't check. In this case, we tell the masses: 'To build socialism, we must overcome difficulties!'"

    I thought: "She has already realized that this idea is wrong, and it will be easy to handle." But she went on to say:

      "However, the problem is not only that we have this wrong idea, the problem is: even if you want to buy more, the higher-ups won't allocate it to you! The higher-level trade departments have always supplied us as a small city, and have not seen the rapid development of Baotou in the past two years, and the changes in the market. As a result, our supply work is far from meeting the needs of the masses' lives."

    I thought: "This matter is also easy to handle. We can let the higher-level trade departments understand the changes in Baotou, and understand the difficulties of starting from scratch..." Before I could finish thinking, Comrade Lin Ke continued:

      "However, the problem is not simple! Even if we realize the ideological error of 'rather be out of stock than have inventory backlog,' even if the higher-level trade departments understand the great changes in Baotou, there is no place to put the goods when they come in large quantities, because the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's investment in the basic construction of Baotou's supply departments is too small. Because of the small investment, many warehouses that should have been built have not been built, supply stations that should have been set up have not been set up, and several department stores that should have been built have not been built. All necessary service industries should adapt to the development of industrial construction. But now, our work is far behind industrial construction!

      "The serious problem is that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region not only invests too little in the basic construction of Baotou's supply departments, but also invests too little in the entire urban construction of Baotou. The city construction plans are reduced year after year, creating a serious passive situation for today's Baotou industrial base: construction has started on the construction site, and the city is only now building roads; the population has already gathered, and the city is only now planning to build various supply and management agencies.

    "Why does the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region invest so little in Baotou's urban construction? Because the Autonomous Region has its own difficulties..."

    Immediately, I thought of a passage written by Comrade Yang Zhilin, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, in the "People's Daily" (see the October 4th, page 3, "Support the Construction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region" article):

    "In terms of various appropriations, some central departments believe that Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has a large financial maneuverability, so they let Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region solve things that should be paid for by themselves. In fact, Inner Mongolia's income is limited, and it has been arranged according to the unified national plan at the beginning of each year, and there is no extra maneuverability. For example, this year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region invested 90% of all urban construction costs in Baotou. Other regions have a lot of opinions because they get too little funds, but Baotou still thinks it is too little. Therefore, it is recommended that the urban construction costs of Baotou and the construction costs of forest areas... be handled by the central government allocating special funds, not included in the local budget. Other new construction areas also require corresponding supporting construction in commerce, education, health, transportation, post and telecommunications, and banks. We hope that the relevant central departments will consider the actual difficulties of Inner Mongolia and give appropriate consideration to the construction of new areas when controlling appropriation indicators."

    Secretary Yang's words should attract the attention of relevant central departments.

### 解决包头供应工作的一个关键问题

    解决包头供应工作的一个关键问题
    本报记者　刘衡
    我在包头访问的时候，听到很多职工和家属反映包头的供应工作大大赶不上群众生活的需要。职工当中有这样一些说法：“参加包头工业基地的建设，光荣倒是光荣。可是，来了两三个月，没有吃上猪肉。”“买东西太难了！要走五、六里路，要站两三个钟头的队。顾了买菜，误了做饭。”有的人还编了一首歌谣：“缺乏供应站，油盐米面不方便。缺少理发店，长出长毛叫人看。有钱无布做衣难，只好披上棉衣过夏天。”
    为什么包头会有这种现象呢？我特地访问了中共包头市委财贸部副部长林克同志。她告诉我：
    “这是因为咱们包头发展得太快了。两年以前，包头还是一个只有九万人的小城市，现在已经有三十几万人了。离包头几十里处，正在建设新市区。去年年初，那里还是一块荒地，现在已经盖了好几大片房子。那时我们估计一间房子住一家人算是最多了。谁知道，房子是死的，人是活的。职工们、家属们不断地来，在一间房子里住上两家，三家。这样，我们的估计数字就太保守了！
    “咱们包头不光是人口增加得快，而且增加的人都是大城市来的，生活习惯跟本地人不一样，购买力也大。可是，我们小手小脚搞惯了，眼界打不开，采购时不敢多买。
  ‘宁肯脱销，不让积压’——这就是我们的经营思想。积压了，上级要批评我们。今年1月，内蒙古商业厅派来一个检查组，就是检查这一点。但脱销了上级却不过问，检查组也不检查。在这种情况下，咱们也就这样对群众说：“建设社会主义嘛，就要克服困难！”
    我想：“她已经察觉这种思想不对头，事情就好办了。”但她接着又说了：
      “可是，问题不仅仅在于我们有这种不对头的思想，问题是：你想多买，上级也不给你调拨呀！上级贸易部门一直把咱们当成一个小城市来供应，没有看出这两年来包头的迅速发展，以及市场上的变化。这样一来，咱们的供应工作更是大大赶不上群众生活的需要了。”
    我想：“这件事情也好办。可以让上级贸易部门了解包头的变化，了解平地起家的困难……”还没等我想完，林克同志又往下说了：
      “可是，问题并不简单呐！就算我们认识了‘宁肯脱销，不让积压’的思想错误，就算上级贸易部门了解了包头的大变化，东西来多了，也没有地方放，因为内蒙古自治区对于包头供应部门的基本建设投资太少了。投资少，许多该建的仓库没有建，该设的供应站没有设，几座该盖的百货大楼也没有盖。一切必要的服务性行业，应该适应工业建设的发展。而现在，我们的工作远远落在工业建设的后面去了！
      “问题严重的是：内蒙古自治区不光是对包头供应部门的基本建设投资太少，对整个包头的城市建设投资都太少了。年年都在削减咱们的城市建设计划，造成今天包头工业基地严重的被动局面：工地开工了，城市才修路；人口已经集结起来了，市里才去计划筹建各种供应和管理机构。
    “为什么内蒙古自治区对包头城市建设投资那样少呢？因为自治区有自治区的困难……”
    立刻，我想起了中共内蒙古自治区委员会书记杨植霖同志在“人民日报”上写的一段话（见10月4日第三版“支援内蒙古自治区的建设”一文）：
    “在各种拨款上，中央有些部门认为内蒙古自治区财政权机动大，因此把应该自己出钱办的事也让内蒙古自治区解决，其实内蒙古的收入是有限的，而且在每年年初都按照国家统一计划作了安排，已经没有多余的机动力量。如今年内蒙古自治区把全部城市建设费的90％投在包头。别的地区因得款太少意见很多，而包头还嫌太少。因此，建议把包头的城市建设费和林区的建设费……由中央另拨专款去办，不列入地方预算。其他新建设区也都要求商业、教育、卫生、交通、邮电、银行等有相应的配合建设。我们希望中央有关部门在控制拨款指标的时候，考虑内蒙古的实际困难，给新区建设以适当照顾。”
    杨书记的这段话应该引起中央有关部门的注意。
