On October 19th (the 16th day of the ninth lunar month), it was the 100th birthday of Xue Zhou, a female member of the Huancheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province. On this day, the elderly widow received warm congratulations from the cooperative members. Besides the agricultural cooperative members, neighbors, and relatives from other places, representatives from Yancheng County and the Urban People's Committee came to her home to celebrate her birthday. According to the old woman herself, she had never had such a lively birthday since she was born.

Xue Zhou's family was originally poor peasants. Her husband had passed away long ago, and she had no sons or grandsons. Of the six daughters she bore, three are still alive, the oldest being seventy-eight years old and the youngest seventy years old, some even having great-grandchildren. Except for her third daughter, who is dependent on her and lives with her, the others live far from her. For eighty or ninety years, Xue Zhou had experienced countless disasters and suffered endless hardships. She originally had five thatched houses, which were burned down by the Japanese invaders during the Anti-Japanese War. Her two mu of dry land could only yield two to three hundred jin of miscellaneous grains each year due to insufficient labor and fertilizer. When her husband was alive, they could rely on odd jobs and small business to make a living, but after his death, life became even more difficult. Her daughters and grandchildren, who lived ten to twenty li away, sometimes helped her, but it was neither timely nor substantial. The daughters and grandchildren were also getting old, making it inconvenient for them to travel back and forth. Thus, Xue Zhou and her now seventy-four-year-old third daughter lived together, unable to care for both their internal and external needs, even having difficulty getting water, and struggling to survive. After liberation, the People's Government had repeatedly provided relief to her, but she still worried about the livelihood and future of herself and her daughter.

In the winter of 1955, more than 250 peasant households in the vicinity were preparing to organize an advanced agricultural cooperative. She was happy to hear that elderly widows and widowers would be taken care of in the cooperative and wanted to sign up, but she was also worried that things might not work out. She thought: from ancient times to the "Republic of China," there had never been such a good thing. Even close relatives have their differences, how could strangers take care of an old widow like me? But because there was really no other way, the mother and daughter finally signed up for the cooperative, intending to give it a try.

After the advanced cooperative was established, things were indeed different. The cooperative management committee acted in accordance with the policies of the Communist Party, caring for and looking after the members. The cooperative had many young and strong men and women, with sufficient labor. Elderly people who could work were assigned light tasks. Xue Zhou and her daughter were not assigned any tasks, allowing them to rest and recuperate, and providing them with food and clothing. Because the mother and daughter were used to working, they couldn't stay idle and asked the cooperative to give them some light work. They received hemp to twist rope and knit fishing nets, and used cotton to spin thread, which sometimes brought them three to four yuan a month. Considering their income situation, the cooperative only required them to return the capital, and all the extra money from selling nets and thread was theirs to keep and not to be handed over to the public. During the spring and summer pre-distribution or sideline distribution, they were given a share each according to the regulations, and people were sent to deliver grain, firewood, and other items to their home. In addition, pocket money was given to them at any time during festivals or according to urgent needs. Although Yancheng area suffered from natural disasters such as typhoons and rainstorms this year, due to the large number of people and the great strength of the advanced cooperative, as well as the strengthening of soil consolidation and drainage after the typhoons and rainstorms, a bumper harvest was still achieved, and most members could increase their income. Xue Zhou's family could receive about 800 jin of grain, over 1,000 jin of firewood, and over 30 yuan in cash. The cooperative also entrusted members living near her to regularly help her in her daily life, carrying water and buying things for her.

This old woman, who had been poor all her life and a widow for half her life, used to hate her birthday, often complaining about why she was born into such a miserable life. But this year, the situation had fundamentally changed, and the agricultural cooperative treated it as a joyous event. The cooperative provided labor and rice straw, and repaired her three dilapidated houses, which had not been repaired for many years, free of charge, renovating and painting them inside and out. The cooperative also took a little money from the public welfare fund (welfare expenses) to sew a new red satin cloak for her and bought her birthday peaches and longevity noodles. The day before her birthday, male and female members carried the cloak to her home with gongs and drums, and put the cloak on her. On her birthday, the Yancheng County People's Committee also sent representatives to give her a new set of clothes and 20 yuan in cash, and people from all walks of life in the urban area also sent her birthday gifts.

The old cooperative member Xue Zhou is in good spirits in the agricultural cooperative and lives more happily every day. Now she can eat two large bowls of dry rice or three large bowls of porridge at each meal. On the eve of her birthday, wearing the new cloak given by the agricultural cooperative, she stood for a long time in the new house in front of the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the wall, repeatedly saying, "Good! Good!"

    老社员的百岁寿辰
    新华社记者　魏文华
      10月19日（农历9月16日），正是江苏省盐城县环城农业生产合作社女社员薛周氏一百岁生辰的一天。这一天，这个孤寡老人受到社员的热烈祝贺。到她家庆寿的人，除了农业社社员、邻居、外地来的亲戚以外，还有盐城县和城区人民委员会的代表。据老太太自己说：她出生以来也没有过过这样热闹的寿日。
    薛周氏的家庭原是贫农，她丈夫早已去世，没有儿子和孙子。所生六个女儿，现在活着的有三个，年龄最大的七十八岁，最小也有七十岁，有的已抱重孙。除了无依无靠的第三个女儿和她一起生活外，其余的离她家都很远。薛周氏八九十年来，经历过无数的灾难，吃尽苦头。原来有五间草房，在抗日战争中被日寇烧毁；二亩旱地，因为劳动力和肥料不足，每年只能收二、三百斤杂粮。她丈夫在世时，可以依靠帮工和做小生意糊口，丈夫死后，生活就更加困难了。住在一、二十里外的女儿和外孙们，有时虽也接济她，但是既不及时，又很有限。女儿和外孙们年纪也大起来，来往走动不便。就这样，薛周氏和她现在已七十四岁的三女儿在一起，那时顾里顾不了外，连吃水也很困难，熬着过苦日子。解放后，人民政府曾经多次救济她，但她仍然耽心母女俩的生活和后事。
    1955年冬季，附近二百五十多户农民要组织高级农业社，她听到孤寡老人在社里有照顾，心里高兴，想报名入社，但是又耽心事情落空。她想：从古到今，从皇帝到
  “民国”，从来也没有过这样的好事，看到世上许多至亲骨肉也还有个亲疏远近，一些素不往来的人还能照顾我这个孤寡老太婆？但因为实在没有办法，母女两人最后报名入社，打算试试看。
    高级社办起来以后，果然样样不同，社务管理委员会按照共产党的政策办事，对社员关心照顾。社里男女青壮年多，劳力充足，能劳动的老年人都分派了轻活做，对薛周氏母女俩并不派活给她们做，要她们安心休养，供给她俩吃穿。母女俩因为平常劳动惯了，闲不下来，向社里请求做点轻活，领了麻在家搓绳结渔网，用棉花捻线，这样有时一月可以收入三、四元。社里考虑到她们的收入情况，只要她们把本钱归还，其余卖网卖线多出来的钱，统统由她们自己支配，不再归公。社里春季、夏季预分或副业分配时，都按规定分给她俩各一份，派人把粮食、柴草等送到她家里。另外，逢年过节或者根据急需，随时发给她们零用钱。今年盐城地区虽然遭受到台风、雨涝等自然灾害，由于发挥了高级社人多力量大的作用以及在台风和雨涝之后加强了壅根培土、排水保苗等工作，仍然获得了丰收，绝大部分社员可以增加收入。薛周氏家里大约可以分到八百多斤粮食，一千多斤柴草和三十多元现金，社里还委托住在她附近的社员，在生活上经常帮助她，为她担水，买东西等。
    这个一生贫苦、半世孤寡的老人，过去恨自己的生日，常常埋怨为什么生下这个苦命的人。可是今年，情况发生了根本变化，农业社恰恰把它当成一件喜事。社里出人工和稻草，义务为她修理了多少年未曾修过的三间破屋，把屋里屋外修理粉刷得焕然一新。社里还从公益金（福利费）中拿出一点钱为她缝制了一件新的红缎披风，给她买了寿桃、寿面，在寿辰前一天，由男女社员们敲着锣鼓送到她家里，把披风穿在她身上。生辰这一天，盐城县人民委员会也派代表送给她一套新衣服和二十元现金，城区各界也送她寿礼。
    老社员薛周氏在农业社里精神很好，生活得一天比一天愉快。现在每顿能吃两大碗干饭或者三大碗稀饭。在寿辰前夕，她穿着农业社送的新披风，久久地站在新屋中悬挂在墙上的毛主席像前，一再地说：“好！好！”
