Xinhua News Agency, Rome, October 1st -- According to TASS: Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti summarized the discussions on the preparations for the party's Eighth National Congress at the party's Central Committee plenary session and analyzed the domestic situation in Italy.

    In analyzing the domestic situation, Togliatti emphasized that the conflict between the leaders of the Italian big bourgeoisie and the Christian Democratic Party, which represents the will of this class, and the interests of the large number of workers who support the Christian Democratic Party, the noteworthy nature of certain basic issues in the Italian Communist Party's program and political line, and the hope for changing the status quo and for a new beginning to change the current political line - this is the background from which the issue of the unity of socialists (the merger of the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party) arises.

    The Italian Communist Party Agrees to Resolve the Issue of Socialist Unity

    Togliatti said: We have expressed our opinion that we agree to raise and resolve the issue of socialist unity, which is to eliminate the division that arose in 1947 (within the Socialist Party). We have no intention of hindering the resolution of this issue. We have the right, and more importantly, as a working-class party, we have the responsibility to clearly state our opinion on the issue of socialist unity, viewing this issue as part of the overall issue of working-class unity, as an aspect of the process aimed at changing the Italian political line.

    We declare that no matter what changes occur in the political lineup of the working class today, it must promote progress rather than stagnation, and certainly not regression. The achievements that have already been made must not be lost. Among these achievements is the unity of the working class in the struggle against reactionary forces and capitalists. Even in new ways, this unity must be maintained.

    Togliatti further pointed out that today, the situation in Italy is different from the specific form of the proletarian dictatorship formed after the October Revolution. He said that this is due to our current social structure, the degree of contradiction and the maturity of class consciousness, the maturity of socialist forces and their progress on the international stage, and the possibility for the working class in our country, under these conditions, to form alliances and cooperate with social groups including some parts of the bourgeoisie to resist the most reactionary groups of monopoly capital. Under these conditions, it is possible to lead the working class in new ways, leading the working class along the democratic path defined in our constitution towards socialism. The constitution points out the path we wish to take. On this path, we must launch the struggle of the working class to realize their demands in every way, the struggle of the working class and its allies to realize the economic and social changes that have already been put on the agenda in Italian society and have already been stipulated by the constitution itself.

    The Necessity of Striving to Establish a Democratic Government Representing the Working Class

    Togliatti then spoke about the necessity of struggling in Italy to establish a democratic government representing the working class. Togliatti said: "We never believe that only after such a government is established can the situation in Italy be changed and the road to establishing a socialist society be paved. We believe that under different governments, relying on the struggle of the broad united masses of workers and peasants, certain institutional reforms can also be realized in Italian society, first of all, the realization of comprehensive land reform, the elimination of the remnants of feudal relations, and at the same time the destruction of the parasitic forms of monopoly capital that have infiltrated the countryside.

    However, a democratic government of the working class should be considered achievable, realizable. The way to do this is to exert pressure on the current political parties by the public with the help of democratic methods and mass actions, in order to defeat and eliminate the political alliance in power today and establish a new political alliance.

    The program of political and economic demands that we have put forward, by its nature, allows us to believe that it can be realized in several stages, depending on the course of events and the development of the mass movement."

    The Suez Crisis Has Developed into a Crisis of the Entire Imperialist Policy

    In reviewing international affairs, Togliatti emphasized that the cause of the Suez crisis lies in the fact that the people, the Egyptian people, like the people of other Asian and African countries, are fighting to defend their sovereignty and independence; they hope that their sovereignty and independence will be recognized by all countries.

    In the Suez conflict, the imperialist countries wanted to achieve the following goals: to frustrate the Egyptian people's struggle for sovereignty and independence, to prevent the entire movement to liberate mankind from colonial shackles, and at the same time to hinder and stop the process of easing international tensions.

    However, the Suez crisis quickly developed into a crisis of the entire imperialist policy of the past decade, especially the crisis of the Atlantic Pact.

    Togliatti pointed out that the contradictions within the imperialist camp are deepening, and emphasized that "for Italy to follow in the footsteps of the imperialist elements who hope to prevent the elimination of colonialism in Asia, Africa, and the entire world, means abandoning Italy's national interests. If it is necessary to ensure that Italy obtains more freedom, more independence, greater economic development, and the ability to improve its political prestige in the near future, then it is necessary to resolutely reject the attempts to make us bear the heavy burden of the Atlantic policy, because the Atlantic policy has become the policy of the imperialist bloc against the people who hope to get rid of the colonial system."

    Togliatti also said: "If we can guarantee Italy a new independent status, at least an independent status within the scope of the old alliance that is currently entangled in the crisis, then we can take a big step forward in striving for peace in Italy and the world."

### 在意大利共产党中央委员会全体会议上  陶里亚蒂号召促进工人阶级的团结

    在意大利共产党中央委员会全体会议上
    陶里亚蒂号召促进工人阶级的团结
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社罗马1日讯：意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂在党的中央委员会全体会议上总结了关于党的第八次全国代表大会的准备工作的讨论情况，并且分析了意大利国内的情况。
    在分析国内形势的时候，陶里亚蒂强调指出，意大利大资产阶级的领袖们和代表这个阶级的意志的天主教民主党同支持天主教民主党的大量工人的利益的冲突，意大利共产党纲领和政治路线的主要因素中某些基本问题的引人注意，人们希望改变现状和希望有一个新的开端来改变现行的政治路线的这种希望——这就是社会主义者的团结问题（社会党和社会民主党合并问题）所由产生的背景。
    意大利共产党赞同解决社会主义者的团结问题
    陶里亚蒂说：我们已经表示过我们的意见说，我们赞同提出和解决社会主义者的团结问题，那就是消除1947年
  （社会党）所产生的分裂的问题。我们无意阻碍这一问题的解决。我们有权利，更重要的是，作为一个工人阶级的政党，我们有责任明确地说明我们对社会主义者的团结问题的意见，把这个问题看作是工人阶级团结的总问题的一部分，看作是目的在于改变意大利政治路线的过程的一个方面。
    我们宣布不论今天工人阶级的政治阵容有什么改变，它必须促进进步而不是停滞，自然更不是倒退。已经取得的成就绝不能丧失掉。在这些成就当中，有一个成就就是在反对反动势力和资本家的斗争中工人阶级的团结。即使是在新的方式下，也必须保持这种团结。
    陶里亚蒂进一步指出，在今天，意大利的情况和十月革命以后形成无产阶级专政的具体形式的情况已经不同了。他说，这是由于我们今天的社会结构，由于矛盾的程度和阶级觉悟的成熟，由于社会主义力量的成熟及其在国际舞台上所取得的进展，由于在我们国家的条件下工人阶级有可能和有时甚至包括资产阶级的某些部分的社会集团结成联盟和进行合作来反抗垄断资本的最反动的集团。在这些条件之下，就有可能以新的方法来领导工人阶级，带领工人阶级沿着我们宪法中所确定的民主的道路走向社会主义。宪法指出了我们希望走的道路。在这条道路上，我们要以一切方式展开工人阶级争取实现他们的要求的斗争，工人阶级和它的同盟者争取实现经济和社会变革的斗争，这些变革在意大利社会中已经提到日程上来了，并且已经由宪法本身加以规定。争取建立一个代表工人阶级的民主政府的必要性
    陶里亚蒂然后谈到在意大利为建立一个代表工人阶级的民主政府而斗争的必要性。陶里亚蒂说：“我们绝不认为，只有在建立起这样一个政府以后，才能改变意大利的状况而铺平建立一个社会主义社会的道路。我们认为，在别样的政府下，依靠工人和农民群众的广泛的联合的斗争，也能够在意大利社会中实现某些制度上的改革，首先是实现全面的土地改革，消灭封建关系的残余并且同时摧毁渗入农村的垄断资本的寄生形态。
    然而，工人阶级的民主政府应该认为是可以建立起来的，是可以实现的。办法就是，借助于民主方法和群众行动由公众对目前的政党施行压力，以便打败和消灭今天执政的政治联盟和建立起新的政治联盟。
    我们所提出来的政治和经济要求的纲领，按其性质来说，许可我们认为它可以分成几个阶段实现，这要看事态进程和群众运动的发展而定”。
    苏伊士危机已发展成为整个帝国主义政策危机
    陶里亚蒂在回顾国际事务的时候强调指出，苏伊士危机的原因在于：人民，埃及人民正如其他亚洲和非洲国家人民一样，是在为维护他们的主权和独立而斗争；他们希望他们的主权和独立得到一切国家的承认。
    在苏伊士冲突中帝国主义国家想达到下列目的：使埃及人民争取主权和独立的斗争受挫，阻止人类从殖民枷锁解放出来的整个运动，同时阻碍并制止国际紧张局势缓和的过程。
    然而，苏伊士危机很快地发展成为过去十年来整个帝国主义政策的危机，特别是成了大西洋公约的危机。
    陶里亚蒂指出帝国主义阵营里的矛盾加深，并且强调说：“使意大利跟着希望阻止清除亚洲、非洲和整个世界的殖民主义的帝国主义分子的脚步走，这意味着放弃意大利的民族利益。如果要保证意大利在不久将来获得较多的自由、较多的独立、较大的经济发展和提高它的政治声望的能力，那就有必要坚决拒绝使我们担负大西洋政策的重负的企图，因为大西洋政策已经成了帝国主义集团反对希望摆脱殖民制度的人民的政策了。”
    陶里亚蒂又说：“如果我们能保证意大利获得新的独立地位，至少是在目前被危机所纠缠的旧的联盟范围内的独立地位，那么，我们在争取意大利和全世界的和平方面就能够前进一大步。”
