    Before, we could only appreciate the artistic gymnastics of the Olympic Games from movies or photos. Now, right here in the Beijing Gymnasium, our own Olympic team's artistic gymnastics selection competition was held. In the selection competition, the compulsory routines for the men's six events and women's four events were the same as the compulsory routines for the artistic gymnastics competition at the 16th Olympic Games. Seeing our country's gymnasts performing beautiful poses and skillful movements such as handstands, circling, tumbling, and jumping on various apparatuses and on the gymnastics mats, one feels how enormous the change is!
    Artistic gymnastics is a very young sport in our country; before 1954, there was no well-formed artistic gymnastics in our country. At the 1953 National Athletics, Gymnastics, and Cycling Games, there were no men's pommel horse, rings, and women's balance beam, uneven bars events. The vault was replaced by a vaulting box, and other events only performed simple and easy movements. The level at that time was very low. Now, we not only have decent artistic gymnastics, and athletes can complete all-around events, but also, among the thirty-one male and female athletes participating in this selection competition, twenty-two are already "Master Athlete" level gymnastics athletes.
    The progress of these athletes is significant. After the compulsory and optional routines competitions, people found that Guo Keyu, a sixteen-year-old female athlete from Tianjin, has surpassed Chen Xiaozhang, the women's all-around champion of this year's national gymnastics championship, and Qi Yufang, the second-place winner, and obtained the most points. In terms of male athletes, Wang Huize, a Harbin athlete who won second place in the men's all-around at this year's national gymnastics championship, scored more points in this competition than Bao Naijian, the men's all-around champion of this year's national gymnastics championship. Lu Enchun, an athlete from Beijing, also scored more points than Yang Jianmin and Qiao Zhenying, who were third and fourth place winners respectively in this year's national gymnastics championship. The scores of these athletes in various competitions are often above nine points (out of a full score of ten).
    Who will be able to go to Melbourne? It will be those who can accurately complete the compulsory routines of the Olympic Games artistic gymnastics in the gymnastics all-around event, and can also steadily perform the optional routines, which are required by the rules to be more difficult than the compulsory routines. We have seen that there are quite a few people who performed the compulsory routines well in the competition, and many advanced movements with considerable difficulty have also appeared in the optional routines competition.
    When our gymnasts arrive in Melbourne, they will face even stricter tests in the competition. The difficulty of the compulsory routines in the Olympic Games gymnastics is not very high, but it requires a high degree of accuracy, stability, and confidence to complete these movements. Athletes from various countries will compete on this point. In terms of optional routines, during the Olympic Games competition, except for vaulting, women are required to have no less than five of the most difficult movements in each event; men are required to have no less than ten high-difficulty movements in each event, including four movements of even higher difficulty and one movement of the highest difficulty, and of course, these movements must be performed well. It is estimated that athletes from various countries will also creatively perform extremely high-difficulty optional movements that have not been seen before.
    If we look at the situation of athletes from various countries and past records, it is not difficult to find that ahead of our country's athletes, there is the Soviet team, which won a complete victory in gymnastics at the previous Olympic Games and swept the top seven places in the men's all-around at the 1954 World Gymnastics Championships; there are also athletes from Switzerland, Japan, and other countries who have repeatedly placed in the top six in various individual events in the two competitions. Judging from the past records, it can be roughly said that if the scores in various competitions cannot reach above 9.5 points, it will be difficult to win one of the top six places; the record table even shows that the minimum line for competing for the top six places in some events has sometimes risen to around 9.7 points. This is the prospect that our gymnasts face in the Olympic Games artistic gymnastics competition.
    The women's rhythmic group exercise with light apparatuses performed in the selection competition—the fan exercise—unites the agile free exercise movements with the graceful movements of our country's classical dance, and it is so rich in our country's national style. It is estimated that when it appears on the carpets in Melbourne, it will arouse extremely widespread interest. (Attached picture)

    竞技体操选拔前后
    其华
    以前，我们还只能从电影里或是照片上来欣赏奥林匹克运动会的竞技体操。现在，就在北京体育馆里，举行了我们自己的奥林匹克运动队竞技体操选拔比赛。在选拔比赛里，男子六项、女子四项比赛的规定动作，就是第十六届奥林匹克运动会上竞技体操比赛的规定动作。看到我国体操运动员们在各种器械上、体操毯上做着倒立、回环、翻腾、跳跃的优美姿势和灵巧动作，令人感到变化是多么巨大呀！
    竞技体操，在我国是一项极年轻的运动；在1954年以前，我国是没有成型的竞技体操的。1953年我国田径、体操、自行车运动大会上，还不能有男子鞍马、吊环和女子平衡木、高低杠的项目，跳马是由跳箱代替，而其他项目也只是做了些简单容易的动作，那时的水平是非常低的。现在，我们不但有了像样的竞技体操，运动员们能够完成全能项目，而且参加这次选拔赛的三十一名男女运动员中，已经有二十二名是“运动健将”级的体操选手。
    这些运动员的进步是很大的，经过规定动作和自选动作的比赛以后，人们发现十六岁的天津女运动员郭可愚，已经超越了今年全国体操冠军赛女子全能冠军陈孝彰和第二名戚玉芳，而获得了最多的分数。在男运动员方面，今年全国体操冠军赛男子全能第二名哈尔滨运动员王辉泽在这次比赛中的分数，超过了今年全国体操冠军赛男子全能冠军鲍乃健。北京市运动员陆恩淳的分数，也多过了今年全国体操冠军赛第三名杨健民和第四名乔振英。这些运动员在各项比赛中的分数经常在九分以上（满分是十分）。
    谁能够去墨尔本呢？将是那些在体操全能项目中既能准确地完成奥林匹克运动会竞技体操的规定动作，又能稳健地做好按照规则所要求的比规定动作具有更高难度的自选动作的人们。我们看到在比赛中较好地完成规定动作的颇不乏人，在自选动作的比赛中也出现了许多具有相当难度的高级动作。
    我们的体操运动员到了墨尔本，在比赛中他们将面临着更加严格的考验。奥林匹克运动会体操的规定动作难度不是十分高的，但要求高度准确、稳当和有把握地来完成这些动作。各国运动员也就在这点上展开竞争。在自选动作方面。奥林匹克运动会比赛时，除跳跃以外，要求女子各项不得少于五个难度最高的动作；男子各项在不少于十个高难度的动作中，还要有四个难度更高的和一个难度最高的动作，当然还要求这些动作都能很好地完成。据估计，各国运动员还将创造性地做出以前还未看到过的极高难度的自选动作。
    如果从各国运动员的情况和以往的纪录来看，那就不难发现在我国运动员的前面，有着在上届奥林匹克运动会上大获体操全胜和席卷了1954年世界体操锦标赛男子全能前七名的苏联队；也有在两次比赛中在各个单项前六名中多次插足的瑞士、日本等国的运动员。从以往纪录的成绩看，大体上可以说，如果各项比赛不能得到九点五分以上，就很难染指前六名的名次；纪录表甚至表明，有的项目有时竞争前六名的最低线竟提高到九点七分左右。这就是我国体操运动员在奥林匹克运动会竞技体操比赛中所面临的前景。
    选拔赛中表演的、由六名女运动员组成的女子轻器械团体操——扇子操，把矫捷的自由体操动作同我国古典舞蹈的优美动作统一在一起，而又那样富有我国的民族风格，估计它出现在墨尔本的地毯上的时候，是会引起极广泛的兴趣的。（附图片）
