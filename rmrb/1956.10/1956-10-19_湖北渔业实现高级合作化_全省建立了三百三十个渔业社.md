Xinhua News Agency Report:

Hubei Province, known nationwide for its freshwater fish production, has achieved complete socialist cooperation in fisheries. To date, a total of 330 advanced fishery production cooperatives have been established throughout the province, with participating fishing households accounting for approximately 90% of the province's total. As the autumn and winter seasons arrive, bringing abundant fish, hundreds of fishery production cooperatives are uniformly organizing their labor force to prepare for peak production.

Hubei Province has a dense network of rivers and lakes, with over 16 million mu of rivers and lakes rich in fish resources. A total of 33,000 fishing households rely on fishing income as their primary source of livelihood. After liberation, the vast majority of fishermen experienced a general increase in income through collective production in mutual aid teams and elementary production cooperatives.

Beginning last winter, while most fishermen in the province participated in elementary fishery cooperatives, advanced fishery production cooperatives were successively established on a trial basis throughout the province. Because advanced cooperatives can fully leverage organized manpower and resources, and extensively develop diverse sideline production activities such as land reclamation, pig raising, and lotus seed harvesting during the off-season, they generally increased income by 30% compared to elementary cooperatives in the short months since their establishment. Thus, seeing the greater advantages of advanced cooperatives with their own eyes, the vast majority of fishermen have enthusiastically requested to organize advanced fishery production cooperatives.

    湖北渔业实现高级合作化
    全省建立了三百三十个渔业社
    据新华社讯　以淡水鱼产闻名全国的湖北省，已经实现了完全社会主义的渔业合作化。到目前止，全省共建立了三百三十个高级渔业生产合作社，入社的渔户约占全省渔户总数90％。随着水落鱼肥的秋冬季节到来，数百个渔业生产合作社正在统一安排劳力，准备迎接旺季生产。
    湖北省江河湖泊纵横密布，全省共有盛产鱼类的江河湖泊面积一千六百多万亩，依靠捕鱼收入为主要生活来源的渔民共有三万三千多户。解放后，广大渔民在互助组和初级生产合作社的集体生产中都普遍地增加了收入。
    从去年冬季开始，这个省绝大部分渔民参加初级渔业社的同时，全省各地并先后试办了高级渔业生产合作社，由于高级社能充分地发挥组织起来的人力物力，利用捕渔淡季广泛开展开荒、养猪、采莲子等多种副业生产，因此在建立以来的短短几个月中，一般要比初级社增加30％的收入。这样，广大渔民亲眼看到高级社更大的优越性，就纷纷要求组织高级渔业生产合作社。
