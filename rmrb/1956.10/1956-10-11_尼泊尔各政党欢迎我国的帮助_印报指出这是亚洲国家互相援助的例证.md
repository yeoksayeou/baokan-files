Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 9th: According to a report from the Indian Press Trust in Kathmandu on October 9th, leaders of various political parties in Nepal have welcomed China's aid of 60 million rupees to Nepal.

U.Padhyaya, General Secretary of the Nepali Congress Party, said that this aid is "immensely generous" because it does not require Nepal to fulfill any conditions. He said, "We can spend this money in any way we want. We are grateful for this."

Riggmi, Chairman of the Nepali National Congress Party, said, "Everyone in Nepal appreciates this expression of goodwill from China." The People's Party also praised "the spirit of assistance."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 10th: Delhi's "Hindustan Times" and "Hindustan Standard" published the full text of the joint statement by Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Acharya on October 9th. The "Hindustan Times" ran the headline: "Panchsheel Emphasized." The "Hindustan Standard" headline was: "A Step Towards Asian Solidarity."

The Hindi daily "Naya Bharat Times" also published an editorial on the same day welcoming China's aid to Nepal. The editorial said, "This is an example of mutual aid between Asian countries. China itself is also a backward country, and it also needs a large amount of funds to carry out heavy development work. Despite this, it has taken a commendable step, like India, promising to give its neighbor Nepal aid."

The editorial also said: "From this mutual cooperation of Asian countries, Western countries should realize that Asia is no longer eager for their aid; therefore, the conditions they stipulate can no longer be accepted."

In its commentary on China's aid of 60 million rupees to Nepal, the "Hindustan Times" said that Nepal's economic development is an urgent need, and the impetus for this development originates from the political evolution of the country from a feudal society to a democratic society. The editorial also said, however, "China's aid is likely to be misunderstood, and it will certainly be misinterpreted among some people. This is something that Acharya needs to clarify. He had Ra. Ku. Nehru (Indian Ambassador to China) helping him and providing him with advice while he was in Beijing. It must be assumed that the two of them must be absolutely certain that China's aid will not affect in the slightest the ties that make India and Nepal practically one country."

The newspaper also said: "India's concern for Nepal's progress is not only reflected in the economic aspect. The political integrity of this country is also extremely important to us, because it is a strategically significant neighbor close to us geographically."

    尼泊尔各政党欢迎我国的帮助
    印报指出这是亚洲国家互相援助的例证
    新华社新德里9日电　据印度报业托辣斯加德满都9日消息：尼泊尔各政党领袖欢迎中国给予尼泊尔六千万卢比的援助。
    尼泊尔国大党总书记乌帕德雅雅说，这项援助是“无比的慷慨”，因为它没有规定要尼泊尔履行任何条件。他说，“我们可以按照我们愿意的任何方式花这笔钱。我们对此表示感激”。
    尼泊尔民族国大党主席雷格米说，“尼泊尔的每一个人都感激中国的这种亲善表示”。人民党也称赞“援助的精神”。
    新华社新德里10日电　德里的“印度斯坦时报”和“印度斯坦旗报”10月9日登载了周恩来总理和阿查里雅首相的联合声明全文。“印度斯坦时报”的通栏标题写道：潘查希拉得到强调”。“印度斯坦旗报”的标题是：“走向亚洲团结的一步”。
    印地文日报“新印度时报”也在同一天发表社论欢迎中国给予尼泊尔的援助。社论说，“这是亚洲国家之间互相援助的例证。中国自己也是一个落后的国家，它自己也需要大批资金去进行繁重的发展工作。尽管这样，它还是采取了值得称赞的步骤，像印度一样答应给它的邻邦尼泊尔以援助。”
    社论还说：“从亚洲国家的这种相互合作中，西方国家应该认识到，现在亚洲已经不再渴望它们的援助了；因此，它们所规定的条件现在再也不能被接受了。”
    “印度斯坦时报”在评论中国给予尼泊尔六千万卢比的援助的时候说，尼泊尔的经济发展是一种迫切的需要，这种发展的动力起源于这个国家从封建社会向民主社会发展的政治演变中。社论又说，但是，“中国的援助大概会为人们所误解，在某些人士中间肯定将会被曲解。这是有待于阿查里雅来澄清的。他在北京的时候有拉·库·尼赫鲁（印度驻中国大使）帮助他和向他提供意见。必须认为，他们两个人必定是绝对肯定了这样一点：中国的援助丝毫不会影响到使印度和尼泊尔实际上像一个国家一样的那些联系的。”
    这家报纸还说：“印度对于尼泊尔的进步的关切不仅表现在经济方面。这个国家在政治方面的完整对于我们也是极其重要的，因为它在地理位置上是靠近我们的具有战略意义的邻国。”
