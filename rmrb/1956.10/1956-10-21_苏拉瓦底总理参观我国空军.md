Xinhua News Agency, 20th - Premier Suhrawardy and his entourage visited the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force in Beijing this morning.

Premier Suhrawardy, accompanied by General Liu Yalou, Commander of the People's Liberation Army Air Force, and others, arrived at an airport near Beijing. He was greeted by a welcoming line of officers, pilots, and mechanics from the Air Force unit stationed there. Premier Suhrawardy inspected a long line of jet fighters parked on the airfield, and then climbed a ladder to enter the cockpit of a Chinese-made jet aircraft for a tour. Subsequently, at the request of photographers, Premier Suhrawardy posed for a photo with General Liu Yalou, Ambassador Ahmed, and Ambassador Geng Biao in front of a long row of aircraft.

The demonstration began with four jet fighters flying in formation at low altitude. They came from the northeast and flashed overhead. Premier Suhrawardy said regretfully, "I hadn't even picked up my camera yet, and they had already flown past." As they flew back towards the northeast, the Premier finally captured them on film. Next, another jet fighter performed various aerobatic maneuvers in the air in front of the distinguished guests.

When the five pilots came before the guests after the performance, Premier Suhrawardy shook hands with them one by one and took pictures with them as a memento.

Zhao Shaochang, the political commissar of the Air Force unit, presented the Premier with a model of a jet fighter on behalf of all the officers and soldiers. Premier Suhrawardy thanked him for this "symbol of goodwill," saying that it represented their goodwill towards Pakistan, and they would reciprocate with similar goodwill. Premier Suhrawardy also donated £200 on the spot as a welfare fund for the Air Force unit.

This morning, Premier Suhrawardy and his entourage also visited an agricultural machinery factory.

    当五位飞行员在表演以后来到贵宾们面前的时候，苏拉瓦底总理同他们逐一握手，并且同他们在一起摄影留念。
    这个空军部队的政治委员赵绍昌代表全体官兵向总理赠送了一架喷气式歼击机模型，苏拉瓦底总理向他感谢这个“善意的象征”，他说，这表示了你们对巴基斯坦的善意，我们将同样答谢你们的善意。苏拉瓦底总理还当场捐赠二百英镑作为空军部队的福利基金。
    今天上午苏拉瓦底总理和随行人员还参观了一个农业机械厂。
