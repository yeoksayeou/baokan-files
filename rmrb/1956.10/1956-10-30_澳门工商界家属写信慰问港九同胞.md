Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 29th: Hong Kong news: Families of the Macao business community wrote letters on the 28th expressing their condolences to Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots and donated one thousand yuan, entrusting the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions to forward the donation to the compatriots who suffered in the Kowloon riots.

    The letter of condolence stated: As everyone knows, the masterminds behind this great atrocity in Kowloon and Tsuen Wan were the lawless Kuomintang secret agents. They recklessly murdered and set fires, disrupted public order, looted homes, extorted, etc. In particular, they stripped women naked, paraded them in the streets, subjected them to all kinds of insults, trampled pregnant women to death, and murdered children. This is simply the behavior of beasts; it is a great massacre that is devoid of humanity. These heinous crimes are something that all Chinese people with conscience and hot blood hate with gnashing teeth!

    The letter concluded by expressing support for Premier Zhou Enlai's protest to the British authorities, demanding that the Hong Kong authorities severely punish the perpetrators, ensure the safety of life and property of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots, the safety of women and children, and earnestly take on all responsibilities for handling the aftermath.

    澳门工商界家属写信慰问港九同胞
    新华社广州29日电　香港消息：澳门工商界家属在28日写信慰问港九同胞，并捐款一千元，托香港中华总商会及港九工会联合会转赠给在九龙暴乱中的受害同胞。
    慰问信中说：人所共知，这次九龙荃湾所发生的大暴行的主谋是无法无天的国民党特务分子，他们肆无忌惮地杀人放火，扰乱治安，打家劫舍，勒索等等，特别是剥光妇女衣服，游街示众，诸般侮辱，踩死孕妇，杀害儿童，这简直是禽兽所为，是灭绝人性的大惨杀。这些滔天罪行，凡是有良心、有热血的中国人民都无不切齿痛恨的！
    信中最后表示拥护周恩来总理向英国当局提出的抗议，要求香港当局严惩肇事者，确保港九同胞的生命财产的安全，妇女儿童的安全，并应切实负起办理善后的一切责任。
