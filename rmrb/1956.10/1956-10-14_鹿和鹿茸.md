    Deer and Antlers
    Zhuang Xueben
    The deer is a very beautiful animal, and it is abundant in our country. The male deer has a pair of beautiful antlers on its head. A humorous Mongolian folk tale says that it borrowed them from the camel. Its branches are numerous, like tree branches inserted in its head; moreover, the antlers are shed and regrown every year.
    Deer antlers are shed in the spring and regenerate in the summer. The newly grown tender antlers are called velvet antlers. When velvet antlers first grow, they are as soft as eggplants, covered with a layer of skin and many hairs. Inside, there is cartilage and many small blood vessels, full of blood, and it feels warm to the touch. Later, the antlers gradually bifurcate; in the autumn, they begin to harden, and the fur gradually falls off. The antlers of a certain species of elk can reach four Chinese feet in length. The antlers on the deer's head are like swords in the hands of warriors, relying on them to fight enemies and also to duel with the same sex. Deer are famous for their fierce competition for mates. During the winter mating season, males fight fiercely with each other. After the spring mating season is over, everyone makes peace, puts down their weapons, and the antlers fall off.
    Both velvet antlers and deer antlers are well-known medicinal materials in traditional Chinese medicine, and velvet antlers have even higher medicinal value, listed as a top-grade medicine in the "Shen Nong's Materia Medica." Every summer and autumn, farmed deer generally have their antlers sawn off when the velvet antler grows two branches. Wild deer have to be shot by hunters, and the antlers are chopped off together with the brain bones. After the antlers are soaked, boiled, or baked and dried in the shade, they become medicinal velvet antlers.
    The processing method for velvet antlers is: first saw them into slices or roast them until crispy, grind them into powder, some are made into pills or powders, some are soaked in medicinal wine, and some are decocted into water medicine for consumption. Li Shizhen of the Ming Dynasty described its medicinal properties in his "Compendium of Materia Medica" as follows: "It generates essence and replenishes marrow, nourishes blood and benefits yang, strengthens tendons and bones, and treats all kinds of deficiency, deafness, blurred vision, dizziness, and dysentery." The Soviet medical community extracted velvet antler essence from velvet antlers and made it into injections and solutions for use as a tonic.
    In the pharmaceutical industry, the types of velvet antlers are generally distinguished according to the color of the fur. Sika deer velvet antler is called yellow hair antler, because it mostly comes from the Northeast, it is also called Guandong antler. It is of the best quality and the most expensive in traditional Chinese medicine. The next is elk velvet antler, called blue hair antler, mostly produced in the Northwest and Southwest, so it is also called Western antler. Moose (also called milu) antler, produced in the Greater Khingan Mountains of Northeast China, is commonly known as Kandahan antler. It is rarely used for medicinal purposes within the customs and is also the cheapest.
    It is said that there are more than forty species of deer in the world (not counting subspecies). At least sixteen species of deer are produced in our country. The deer that can be used for velvet antlers are roughly: sika deer, moose, and elk in Northeast and North China; elk in Northwest and Southwest China (including red deer, white deer, white-lipped deer, and Thorold's deer, etc.); black deer in Central and South China; and sika deer in East China and Taiwan. These deer all belong to the even-toed ungulate ruminant category. Most of the deer in our country are wild in the mountains and forests, and only sika deer are raised in large numbers in Northeast and North China.
    Domesticated deer reproduce relatively quickly, and velvet antlers can be collected in a planned way, and production can be rapidly increased. In feeding, generally feed Artemisia grass, alfalfa, green vegetables, radishes, etc. For concentrated feed, use bean and corn bran, and give a little salt periodically. Deer have few diseases and are easy to raise. Does become pregnant from the age of two, producing one offspring per year, occasionally two. Bucks grow antlers from the age of two, and take antlers from the age of three, one pair a year. The lifespan of sika deer is about fifteen to twenty years.
    The deer is one of the animals with high economic value. Each buck produces one pair of velvet antlers per year. Each pair of sika deer antlers weighs several taels to more than ten taels, and each pair of elk antlers weighs more than ten taels to sixty or seventy taels. Sika deer from the age of four to nine is the best antler production period. The value of velvet antlers produced by one sika deer per year can reach five or six hundred yuan. Deer meat, tendons, antlers, bones, tails, and fetuses are also valuable medicinal materials in traditional Chinese medicine. Now, in Yili, Yuli and other places in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, some agricultural production cooperatives have captured dozens of wild young deer in the mountains this year and raised them in deer farms. In areas with more deer production, the method of capturing young deer for breeding should be promoted. (Attached picture)

    鹿和鹿茸
    庄学本
    鹿是一种形态非常漂亮的动物，在我国出产很丰富。公鹿头上有一对美丽的角，富有风趣的蒙古族民间故事里说，它是向骆驼借来的。它的杈桠很多，像树枝插在头上；而且角一年一换，脱而复长。
    鹿角是在春季脱落，夏季再生，初生的嫩角叫做鹿茸。鹿茸开始生出时像茄子一样软，外面包着一层皮，长有许多茸毛，里面是软骨和许多细血管，充满着血液，摸起来感觉温暖。后来，角渐渐分叉；到了秋季开始硬化，毛皮也渐渐脱落。有一种马鹿的角长达四市尺。鹿头上的角正像武士手中的剑，仗着它和敌人厮杀，也和同性决斗。鹿是著名的争偶很激烈的动物，冬季发情期，雄兽之间互相斗得很凶，等到春季交配期一过，大家言归于好，放下武器，角就都脱落了。
    鹿茸和鹿角都是中药中著名的药材，鹿茸的药用价值更高，“神农本草经”里列为上品。每年夏秋家养的鹿一般在茸长双叉时就把它锯下，野生的鹿得由猎人射杀，连茸带脑骨一起砍下。茸经过泡煮或焙制后阴干，就成为药用的鹿茸。
    鹿茸的加工法是：先锯成片或经过炙酥，研成粉末，有的制成丸、散，有的泡成药酒，也有煎成水药服用的。明朝李时珍的“本草纲目”这样论述它的药性：“生精补髓，养血益阳，强筋健骨，治一切虚损、耳聋目暗、眩运虚痢。”苏联医药界从鹿茸中提出鹿茸精，制成针剂和水剂，用为强壮滋补药。
    在药业中，一般按照皮毛的颜色来区别鹿茸的种类。梅花鹿茸称为黄毛茸，因为它多数来自东北，又称关东茸，在中药中品质最优，价格也最贵。次为马鹿茸，称青毛茸，多数产于西北、西南，所以又称西茸。驼鹿（也叫麋）茸，产于东北大兴安岭，俗名堪达罕茸，关内采作药用的少，价格也最贱。
    据说全世界的鹿共有四十多种（亚种不算在内）。我国出产的鹿至少有十六种。能采作鹿茸的鹿，大致是：东北、华北的梅花鹿、驼鹿、马鹿，西北、西南的马鹿（包括赤鹿、白鹿、白唇鹿、寿鹿等），中南的黑鹿，华东以至台湾的梅花鹿。这些鹿都属于偶蹄目反刍类。我国的鹿大多数野生在山林中，只有梅花鹿在东北华北有大群的驯养。
    驯养的鹿，繁殖较快，可以有计划地采取鹿茸，并且可以迅速提高产量。在饲养上，一般喂蒿草、苜蓿、青菜、萝卜等，精料用豆类和玉米的麸粉，并隔期稍给以食盐，幼时可以喂牛乳。鹿的疾病较少，家养不难。母鹿在二岁起怀胎，每年一产，每胎一仔，偶而有二仔。公鹿二岁起长角，三岁起取茸，一年一对。梅花鹿的寿命约十五岁到二十岁。
    鹿是经济价值很高的动物之一，每头公鹿每年生鹿茸一对。梅花鹿的茸每对重数两至十数两，马鹿茸每对重十数两至六七十两。梅花鹿从四岁到九岁是最好的产茸期，一头梅花鹿每年生产的鹿茸价值可达五六百元。鹿的肉、筋、角、骨、尾、胎也都是中药的贵重药材。现在新疆维吾尔自治区的伊犁、尉犁等地方，有的农业生产合作社今年在山中捕捉了几十头野生的小鹿放在养鹿场里饲养。在产鹿较多的地方，上边那个捕小鹿饲养的办法值得推广。（附图片）
