Xinhua News Agency report: The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a work conference for the inland high-altitude, impoverished mountain areas from September 24th to 30th. In a comprehensive inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies, it seriously criticized Great Han chauvinist thought and work styles. Based on the resolutions of the province's first Party Congress, it studied methods and measures to help ethnic minorities in high-altitude, impoverished mountain areas gradually change their backward conditions.

According to surveys, the inland high-altitude, impoverished mountain areas of Yunnan have a population of approximately 1.68 million, including Miao, Yao, Yi, Lisu, and over a dozen other ethnic groups. After land reform and the development of the cooperative movement, agricultural production of all ethnic groups has developed to a certain extent, and their economic and cultural lives have improved significantly. However, compared with general areas, the progress of the economy and culture of the people of the mountain areas is slower. The people of the local ethnic minorities still face many difficulties in production and life, and the average annual total income from agricultural and sideline occupations per person is only about 20 yuan. The meeting pointed out in its inspection: After the land reform, the leading organs have long neglected to lead the work in these areas according to the characteristics of the high-altitude, impoverished mountain areas, lacked specific understanding of the suffering of the masses, and simply transplanted the experience of the Han areas in the plains. Therefore, the ethnic work in the high-altitude, impoverished mountain areas has been weak.

The speeches at the meeting indicated that in leading production, some leading organs neither based themselves on the characteristics of the mountain areas nor summarized the original experience of the local people, blindly promoting the methods of the Han people in the plains, neglecting the diversified management of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. In the cooperative movement, insufficient consideration was given to the characteristics of various regions and ethnic groups, and the scale of establishment of cooperatives was blindly enlarged in many places. The speeches at the meeting also discussed the shortcomings in grain and taxation, commerce, culture and education, health, and cadre training. After listening to the speeches of grassroots cadres of various ethnic groups, the meeting solemnly pointed out: This subjective, bureaucratic, and commanding work style, which lacks investigation and research into the situation in the mountain areas, is a reflection of Great Han chauvinist thought in the ethnic work in the mountain areas.

After repeated discussions, the meeting unanimously agreed that it is necessary to change the leadership style, promote the style of in-depth investigation and research and close contact with the masses, and, according to the provincial party committee's established policy of "giving more, asking for less, and fair prices" in the high-altitude mountain areas, rely on the masses and state assistance to develop the economy and culture of ethnic groups in the mountain areas, meet their political demands, and maximize the enthusiasm of all ethnic groups to gradually change the backward situation in the mountain areas.

The meeting also criticized the two deviations of some cadres emphasizing the backwardness of the mountain areas while underestimating the favorable conditions for developing production locally and not recognizing the long-term and arduous nature of transforming the backward situation in the high-altitude, impoverished mountain areas. The meeting believed that the fundamental link in helping local ethnic groups gradually get rid of poverty lies in vigorously leading the development of production and improving production tools. Therefore, it is necessary to advocate the development of diversified economies in accordance with local conditions, strengthen assistance to the mountain areas in improving production technology, systematically carry out water conservancy projects, fix farmland, improve soil, accumulate manure and apply fertilizer, and, while replenishing old-fashioned farm tools, gradually try out new-style farm tools suitable for the conditions in the mountain areas; and, on the basis of comprehensive planning and exploration of increase-production methods, the state should provide interest-free loans for agricultural capital construction and help train technical personnel. The meeting believed that the comprehensive development of the economy and culture in the mountain areas should be promoted on the basis of developing production. The meeting also formulated specific measures to develop commerce, transportation, culture, education, health, and improve tax work in the mountain areas.

In order to ensure the completion of the above tasks, the meeting believed that the local and county party committees should quickly establish working committees for the high-altitude, impoverished mountain areas, with the deputy secretary or deputy director of the Production Cooperation Department specifically responsible for leading the work in the high-altitude, impoverished mountain areas, and in areas with many mountain areas, the secretary or director should be responsible. It is necessary to actively train local ethnic minority cadres in the cooperative movement, regard the regular convening of ethnic representative meetings and symposiums as a system, and leaders at all levels must respect the opinions of local ethnic cadres and the wishes of the masses in all their work, proceed from the local characteristics, strengthen specific leadership, and continue to criticize and overcome Great Han chauvinist thought.

    云南省委召开山区工作会议
    全面检查民族政策执行的情况
    认真研究发展经济文化的措施
    据新华社讯　中共云南省委在9月24日到30日召开的内地高寒贫瘠山区工作会议上，从全面检查民族政策的执行情况中，严肃地批判了工作中的大汉族主义思想和作风，根据省的第一次党代表大会的决议，研究了帮助高寒贫瘠山区少数民族逐步改变落后状态的办法和措施。
    根据调查，云南内地高寒贫瘠山区约有一百六十八万人口，包括苗、瑶、彝、傈僳等十几个民族。经过土地改革和发展合作化运动，各民族的农业生产有了一定的发展，经济和文化生活有了显著改善，但是和一般地区比较起来，山区各族人民经济文化的进展要慢一些，当地少数民族人民在生产和生活上至今依然存在着很多困难，平均每年每人的农副业总收入还只有二十元左右。会议在检查中指出：在土地改革以后，领导机关长期地忽视了根据高寒贫瘠山区的特点去领导这些地区的工作，对群众疾苦缺乏具体了解，工作中单纯搬用汉族地区经验，因此使高寒贫瘠山区民族工作一直处于薄弱状态。
    会议的发言中表明：在领导生产上，若干领导机关既不根据山区特点，又不总结当地人民原有经验，盲目推广汉族平坝地区的办法，忽视农、林、牧结合的多种经营。在合作化运动中，对各地区各民族的特点照顾不够，不少地方建社规模盲目图大。会议的发言中还谈到了粮食和税收、商业、文教卫生、培养干部等项工作中的缺点。会议在倾听了各族基层干部的发言后严肃指出：这种对山区情况缺乏调查研究的主观主义、官僚主义和命令主义的工作作风，是大民族主义思想在山区民族工作中的反映。
    会议在经过反复的讨论后一致认为：必须转变领导作风，提倡深入的调查研究和密切联系群众的作风，根据省委既定的在高寒山区“给的多、要的少、价格公道”的方针，依靠群众和国家的援助，发展山区民族的经济、文化，满足他们的政治要求，才能最大限度地发挥各族人民的积极性，逐步改变山区的落后面貌。
    会议还同时批判了若干干部强调山区落后而对当地发展生产的有利条件估计不足和对改造高寒贫瘠山区的落后面貌的长期性、艰苦性认识不足的两种偏向。会议认为帮助当地民族逐步摆脱贫困的根本环节，是在于大力领导发展生产和改善生产工具。因此，必须提倡因地制宜地发展多种经济，加强帮助山区提高生产技术，有计划地兴修水利、固定耕地、改良土壤、积肥施肥，在添补旧式农具同时，逐步试行适合于山区条件的新式农具；并在全面规划和挖掘增产窍门的基础上，由国家发放无偿贷款进行农业基本建设，和帮助训练技术人员。会议认为应在发展生产的基础上促进山区经济文化的全面发展。会议并制定了发展山区商业、交通运输、文教卫生和改进税收工作的具体措施。
    为了保证上述任务的完成，会议认为：各地、县委应迅速成立高寒贫瘠山区工作委员会，由副书记、生产合作部副部长具体负责领导高寒贫瘠山区的工作，在山区多的地区由正书记、正部长负责。并在合作化运动中积极培养当地少数民族干部，把定期召开民族形式的代表会、座谈会作为一种制度，各级领导在各种工作中必须尊重当地民族干部的意见和群众的意愿，从当地特点出发，加强具体领导，继续批判和克服大民族主义思想。
