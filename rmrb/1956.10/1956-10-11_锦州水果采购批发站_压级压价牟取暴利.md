    Jinzhou Fruit Purchasing and Wholesale Station
    Suppressing Grades and Prices to Seek Excessive Profits
    From September 13th to 25th, the Jinzhou Fruit Purchasing and Wholesale Station purchased more than 200,400 jin of Hongyu apples from the Jinzhou Fruit Farm (other varieties not included). During this purchasing process, the station engaged in serious grade and price suppression. For example, they initially purchased over 5,000 jin of first-grade Hongyu apples, but when reselling them, they became 30,000 jin. The purchased second-grade apples initially amounted to over 38,000 jin, but when sold to the Jinzhou Canned Food Factory, they became over 50,000 jin. The rest were also sold at higher grades in the market.

    Not only that, but the station also made many rigid regulations regarding purchasing procedures and methods, causing undue losses to the production department. For example, the purchasing department and the production department should sign a guarantee contract in accordance with national regulations. If the inspection reveals that the grade does not match, in addition to appropriately downgrading the apples according to specifications, appropriate penalties should also be given. This can not only avoid wasting manpower but also reduce the rate of fruit bruising. However, the Jinzhou Fruit Purchasing and Wholesale Station insisted that the fruit be sent to the market for re-selection by hired workers. In the process of unloading and loading, many of the original first-grade apples without any blemishes became second-grade products.

    In addition, the Jinzhou Canned Food Factory needs a large number of apples to make canned apples. The farm should supply them directly to simplify procedures and save vehicle and manpower. However, the Jinzhou Fruit Purchasing and Wholesale Station forced them to be supplied through them. How did they supply them? They didn’t even expend the slightest effort, merely saying an empty phrase, "Send it there!" The third-grade apples purchased from the farm were transferred to the Canned Food Factory as second-grade products without any changes. This is simply an act of fraudulently obtaining excessive profits. We hope that relevant higher-level departments will investigate and correct this.

### 锦州水果采购批发站  压级压价牟取暴利

    锦州水果采购批发站
    压级压价牟取暴利
    锦州水果采购批发站在9月13日至25日的十三天当中，共收购锦州果树农场红玉苹果二十万零四千多斤（其他品种不在内）。该站在这次收购工作中，有严重的压等压价行为。如他们收购的一等红玉苹果原是五千多斤，可是，转手出售时竟变成了三万斤，收购的二等品原是三万八千余斤，卖给锦州罐头食品厂的时候却变成了五万多斤。其余的也都在市场上提等出售了。
    不仅如此，该站还在收购手续上和方法上，做了许多硬性的规定，使生产部门遭到了不应有的损失。比如收购部门与生产部门本应按照国家规定标准，签定保证合同，倘检收发现等级不符时，除按规格予以适当降等外，还应给予应得的处罚。这样既可避免浪费人力，又可减少果实磕伤率。但锦州水果采购批发站坚持必须将水果送到市场重行雇工挑选，在一倒一装中间，原来毫无伤痕的一等苹果，不少变成了次等品。
    此外，锦州罐头食品厂做苹果罐头，需要大批苹果，应当由农场直接供应以简化手续、节省车力、人力，但锦州水果采购批发站强制必须通过他们供应。他们怎样供应呢？连一举手一投足之劳都没费，仅仅说了一句空话“送去吧！”原封不动的就从农场收购来的三等品苹果当作二等品拨交罐头食品厂了，这简直是一种骗取暴利的行为。希望上级有关部门检查纠正。
