    Let Technical School Graduates Give Full Play to Their Talents
    Recently, from an inspection report, I learned of a puzzling matter: the issue of the employment of graduates from the Daye Iron and Steel Industrial Technical School. This school has trained 1,250 third and fourth-grade electrical installation fitters, welders, draftsmen, and other personnel for the country since it was established in April 1953 until the first semester of this year. When students graduated, the school, together with Wuhan Iron and Steel Company and the direct employers, organized professional skill assessments and formally evaluated their technical grades. However, after the graduates were assigned to various work units, the units did not treat them as technicians but uniformly regarded them as apprentices. Even if they were capable of doing the work of third and fourth-grade technicians, they were only paid apprentice wages. The reason given was: "Our veteran technicians take five or six years to reach the fourth or fifth grade; how can these young kids get the wages of third and fourth-grade technicians as soon as they start working?" It was not until these young people raised objections and appealed to the State Council that they hastily resolved the issue, but only after a delay of one to one and a half years. Electrical installers who were assigned to Wuhan Iron and Steel's Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Company in August 1954 are still apprentices. Even more heartbreaking, due to Wuhan Iron and Steel's long-term delays, some students were transferred to Jiangxi and Hunan provinces to carry soil and repair roads. Some were reassigned to factories as apprentices, euphemistically called "continued improvement." Some were assigned to manage telephones. Some became material clerks. Two female comrades assigned to the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Company became service personnel.
    I don't understand why the state spends money to run a technical school, recruits thousands of junior high school graduates, and teaches them subjects such as process engineering, materials science, and electrical engineering, only to have the trained "well-rounded new type of skilled workers" assigned to carry soil, become apprentices, or serve as service personnel? Why is the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry constantly complaining about the shortage of skilled workers, busy setting up technical schools, and busy entrusting various places to train skilled workers on its behalf, while allowing Wuhan Iron and Steel Company to render these thousand-plus young technicians unemployable?
    Why not transfer the talents that one's own department does not temporarily need to other units, but instead insist on keeping them, and groundlessly make them do work that does not require their skills?
    In my mind, I cannot help but think of two scenes. One is: when students are studying in the classroom, teachers painstakingly describe the beautiful picture of the motherland's socialism and solemnly tell the students to love and respect their profession and to make the expertise they have learned shine with dazzling sparks. The students listen quietly, eyes wide open, and sincerely accept the teacher's teachings. But after leaving school, another scene emerges. They stand in the offices of the personnel or labor and wage departments, listening to the section chief's admonishments: you must obey the organization's assignment, this is a test; the job is not so ideal, there must be a process; what professional specialization? What's wrong with a welding worker managing telephones? Finally, the door is closed with a big label of "individualism."
    I ask, which worker does not want his labor to achieve the due results? Which staff member does not want to make more and more effective contributions to socialist construction?
    I hope that the superior authorities of the Daye Technical School—the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company—will seriously inspect the assignment of graduates from this technical school and not waste the state's material resources, financial resources, and human resources. I also hope that the competent departments of all technical schools in the country will not only enthusiastically establish and run technical schools well but also correctly allocate and use the graduates of technical schools so that they can play an active role as "new-type technicians" in their respective jobs.　Cheng Qun

    让技工学校毕业生发挥所长
    最近从一份检查材料里，了解到一件令人不解的事：这就是大冶钢铁工业技工学校毕业学生的使用问题。这个学校自从1953年4月开办，到今年上学期，共为国家培训出三、四级电气安装钳工、电焊工、制图员等一千二百五十名。学生毕业的时候，都由学校会同武汉钢铁公司和直接用人单位组织了专业考工，正式评定了技术等级。但是，毕业学生被分配到各工作单位后，各单位都不把他们当技工使用，而一律当徒工看待。就是能做三、四级技工的活，也只给徒工的工资。理由是：“我们的老技工都是五、六年才到四级、五级，这些年轻的娃娃怎么一到工作岗位就拿三、四级技工的工资？”直到这些青年闹起意见，并且向国务院提出申诉后，他们才慌慌张张给以解决，但是已经拖了一年、一年半。1954年8月分配到武钢机电工程公司的电装工，直到现在还是学徒工。更令人痛心的是，由于武汉钢铁公司长期窝工，有些学生被调到江西、湖南等地去挑土修路。有的被重新分配到工厂去当学徒，美其名曰：“继续提高”。有的被分配去管电话机。有的当了材料员。被分配到机电工程公司的两个女同志则变成了服务员。
    我不了解，为什么要国家花钱去办一所技工学校，招上成千名的初中毕业生，学那些工艺学，材料学，电工学等学科，而培训出来的“全面发展的新型技术工人”却又被分配去挑土，当学徒，当服务员呢？为什么冶金工业部现在到处叫技术工人不够，忙着筹办技工学校，忙着委托各地代训技术工人，而让武汉钢铁公司把这一千多名青年技工弄到无处安插的地步呢？
    为什么自己部门暂时不需要的人才，不输送给其他单位使用，而硬要把他们捆在手里，并且毫无理由地让他们去做那些并不需要他们做的工作呢？
    我的脑子里，不禁想起了两幅图景。一幅是：当学生在课堂学习的时候，教师们苦心孤诣地描述着祖国社会主义美丽的图景，并且严肃地告诉学生，要热爱和尊重自己的职业，要使自己所学的专长闪出耀目的火花。学生们静静地听着，眼睛睁睁地望着，诚恳地接受了老师的教诲。可是出了学校，另一幅图景产生了。他们站在人事科或劳动工资科的屋子里，听着科长的教训：你们要服从组织分配，这是考验；工作不是那么理想的，要有一个过程；什么专业不专业，学电焊工的管一下电话机有什么不可？最后以“个人主义”的大帽子封了门。
    试问哪个劳动者不想自己的劳动获得应有的成果？那个工作人员不想在社会主义建设中作出更多的、更有效的贡献呢！
    希望大冶技工学校的上级主管部门——冶金工业部建筑局和武汉钢铁公司认真检查这批技工学校毕业生的分配工作，不要浪费国家的物力、财力和人力。也希望全国所有技工学校的主管部门，不但要热心开办和办好技工学校，而且要正确地分配和使用技工学校的毕业生，使他们在各个工作岗位上发挥“新型技工”的积极作用。　成群
