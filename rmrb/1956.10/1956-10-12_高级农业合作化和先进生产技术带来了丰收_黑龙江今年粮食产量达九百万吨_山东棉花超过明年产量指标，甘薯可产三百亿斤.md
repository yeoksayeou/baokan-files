Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 11th - This year is a bumper year for Heilongjiang Province. According to estimates by the Provincial People's Committee, this year's total grain output can reach the grain production target of Heilongjiang Province's First Five-Year Plan – nine million tons, which is eighty thousand tons more than last year. Currently, members of agricultural cooperatives in various places are carrying out the autumn harvest. According to the Provincial Department of Agriculture, by the end of the first ten days of October, 50% to 60% of the fields had been harvested, and crops such as millet and broomcorn millet, which are susceptible to wind damage, have been completely harvested.

	Before the start of the autumn harvest, agricultural cooperatives in various places formulated harvesting plans to ensure timely harvesting, increased production, and guaranteed yields. They also made unified arrangements for labor and revised labor quotas. Some cooperatives also adopted the method of assigning areas to teams within brigades, which reduced wasted effort and ensured the quality of the harvest. Agricultural cooperatives in Xinlong Township, Zhaozhou County, also assigned harvesting plots to women and the elderly, which brought into play their enthusiasm and accelerated the pace of the autumn harvest. In order to ensure that all the grain is brought into the granary, many agricultural cooperatives have also launched competitions for careful cutting, careful harvesting, careful hauling, and careful threshing to avoid wasting grain. After harvesting the crops, the cooperatives in Xinlong Township, Zhaozhou County, went back to the fields to pick up the dropped ears of grain.

	This year, 700,000 hectares of farmland in Heilongjiang Province were flooded. Under these severe disaster conditions, a bumper harvest was still achieved, mainly due to the realization of advanced agricultural cooperation throughout the province and the adoption of various advanced technologies and production-increasing measures by agricultural cooperatives. This year, farmers throughout the province planted high-yield and stable-yield crops on 30% of the land, increased paddy fields by 120,000 hectares and irrigated land by more than 20,000 hectares, and newly reclaimed and expanded the sowing area by more than 400,000 hectares. In particular, the increased area of fertilization, the area of flat sowing with new agricultural tools, and the area of planting improved varieties have had a significant effect on increasing production. In the disaster-stricken areas, after the vigorous and timely rescue and strengthened field management by the agricultural cooperatives, 400,000 hectares of disaster-stricken land can also obtain varying degrees of harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 10th - Heilongjiang Province has a bumper harvest of soybeans. According to estimates by the Provincial Bureau of Statistics, the total output of soybeans on more than 1.53 million hectares throughout the province can increase by more than 300,000 tons compared with last year, and the average yield per hectare can reach 1,130 kilograms, an increase of 9.9% compared with last year. According to surveys and actual measurements in the main soybean producing counties of Hailun, Suihua, and Shuangcheng, the average yield of soybeans per hectare in most agricultural cooperatives is more than 1,500 kilograms.

	This year, the soybeans planted in Heilongjiang Province are all improved varieties such as "Mancangjin" and "Zihua No. 4." The area of soybean sowing with rhizobium inoculation reached 780,000 hectares throughout the province, accounting for more than half of the total sowing area. Agricultural cooperatives in various places also used new agricultural tools to sow soybeans and increased the amount of fertilizer applied. Therefore, soybeans generally grow with many pods and large grains.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 11th - Shandong Province's 12.85 million mu of cotton has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. According to the Department of Agriculture, the total output will reach more than 5.42 million dan. This is not only nearly 30% more than last year, but also exceeds the planned cotton production target for 1957 (4.08 million dan). The yield per unit area will reach 42 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 15% compared with last year.

	In the process of striving for a bumper cotton harvest this year, Shandong farmers, in addition to actively promoting the experience of large-scale high-yield cotton in Xinjiang, also overcame many difficulties. In mid-to-late June, cotton aphids, which harm cotton growth, spread widely, weeds filled the cotton fields, and the continuous rainy weather at that time meant that many areas were engaged in both summer harvesting and summer planting, which brought many difficulties to pest control and weeding. In order to overcome these difficulties, agricultural production cooperatives in various places made unified arrangements for labor, vigorously eliminating pests on the one hand, and organizing women and children to go to the fields to pull weeds on the other. Through various efforts, the difficulties were finally overcome. Then, the late-stage management of cotton fields was strengthened, creating conditions for a bumper harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 11th - Shandong Province has a bumper harvest of sweet potatoes (i.e., sweet potatoes), with an estimated total output of more than 31 billion jin. This figure exceeds last year's actual output by 50% and accounts for more than one-quarter of the province's total grain output. In some concentrated sweet potato producing areas, the sweet potato output accounts for about one-half of the total grain output.

	Sweet potatoes contain a lot of moisture and are not easy to preserve. In the past, a large amount of them rotted every year due to poor storage. This spring, 360 million jin of sweet potatoes rotted throughout the province (four jin of sweet potatoes are equivalent to one jin of grain, which is equivalent to about 90 million jin of grain). For this reason, the Shandong Provincial People's Committee issued instructions on the storage of sweet potatoes on the 8th of this month, and the Shandong Dazhong Daily also published an editorial on the 9th, requesting organizations at all levels to earnestly help farmers harvest, store, and use this year's sweet potatoes well.

### 高级农业合作化和先进生产技术带来了丰收  黑龙江今年粮食产量达九百万吨  山东棉花超过明年产量指标，甘薯可产三百亿斤

    高级农业合作化和先进生产技术带来了丰收
    黑龙江今年粮食产量达九百万吨
    山东棉花超过明年产量指标，甘薯可产三百亿斤
    新华社哈尔滨11日电　今年，黑龙江省是个丰收年。据省人民委员会估计，今年粮食总产量可以达到黑龙江省第一个五年计划的粮食生产指标——九百万吨，能比去年多收八十万吨粮食。当前，各地农业社的社员们正在进行秋收，据省农业厅了解，到10月上旬末已有50％到60％的大田收割完毕，怕风磨的谷子、糜子等作物已经全部割完。
    秋收开始前，各地农业社为了适时收割，增产保收，都作了收割计划，并且对劳动力做统一安排，修订了劳动定额。有些社还采取大队划小组分片包干的办法，减少了窝工浪费，保证了收割质量。肇州县新隆乡的农业社还特为妇女、老人划出收割的地块，发挥了他们的积极性，也加快了秋收速度。为使粮食颗粒归仓，不少农业社还展开了细割、细收、细拉、细打不浪费粮食的竞赛。肇州县新隆乡各社割完庄稼后又到地里捡一遍把掉到地里的穗头都捡了回去。
    黑龙江省今年曾有七十万公顷农田被淹。在这种严重灾害的情况下，仍然获得丰收，主要是全省实现了高级农业合作化，各农业社采用了多种多样先进技术和增产措施的结果。今年全省农民在30％的土地上种植了高产、稳产作物，增加了十二万公顷水田和二万余公顷水浇地，新开荒扩大播种面积四十多万公顷，特别是增加了施肥面积、新农具平播面积和种植优良品种的面积，这些措施对增产有显著作用。在受灾区被淹的农田，经各农业社的大力及时抢救和加强田间管理后，也有四十万公顷受灾地可以获得程度不同的收成。
    新华社哈尔滨10日电　黑龙江省大豆丰收。据省统计局的估计，全省一百五十三万多公顷大豆的总产量可以比去年增加三十多万吨，每公顷平均产量可以达到一千一百三十公斤，比去年提高9.9％。大豆主要产区海伦、绥化、双城等县根据调查和实测的结果，大部分农业社的大豆每公顷平均产量在一千五百公斤以上。
    今年黑龙江省种植的大豆，全部是“满仓金”、“紫花四号”等良种。全省用根瘤菌拌种的大豆播种面积达到七十八万公顷，占播种总面积一半以上。各地农业社还使用新式农具播种大豆，增加施肥量等。因此，大豆普遍生长得荚多粒大。
    新华社济南11日电　山东省一千二百八十五万亩棉花，获得空前丰收。据农业厅估算，总产量将达到五百四十二万多担。不仅比去年增产近30％，而且超过了规定的1957年棉花增产计划指标（四百零八万担）。单位面积产量每亩将达到四十二斤皮棉，比去年增加一成半。
    山东农民在争取今年棉花丰收的过程中，除积极推广新疆棉花大面积丰产的经验外，还战胜许多困难。6月中、下旬，危害棉花生长的棉蚜虫普遍蔓延，棉田里的杂草满地，加之当时阴雨连绵，不少地区正在夏收夏种，这对治虫、锄草带来很多困难。各地农业生产合作社为了克服这些困难，统一安排了劳力，一方面大力除治虫害，另一方面组织妇女和儿童下地拔草。经过各种努力，终于战胜了困难。接着又加强了棉田的后期管理，为丰收创造了条件。
    新华社济南11日电　山东省地瓜（即甘薯）大丰收，预计总产量可达三百一十多亿斤。这个数字超出去年实际产量50％，占全省粮食总产量的四分之一以上。有些地瓜集中产区，地瓜产量达粮食总产量的二分之一左右。
    地瓜含水分较多，不易保存，过去每年都由于保存不好有大量腐烂，今春，全省腐烂的地瓜就有三亿六千万斤（四斤地瓜折合一斤粮食，约计折合粮食九千万斤）。为此，山东省人民委员会于本月8日就贮藏地瓜问题发出指示，山东大众日报9日也为此发表社论，要求各级组织切实帮助农民把今年的地瓜收好存好用好。
