Uzbekistan is a Soviet republic that is a major producer of cotton, supplying two-thirds of all cotton in the Soviet Union, and is known as the "Land of White Gold." Today marks the thirty-second anniversary of the establishment of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic and its accession to the Soviet Union.

Uzbekistan is located in the heart of Central Asia, bordering Afghanistan to the south, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to the east, Kazakhstan to the north, and Turkmenistan to the southwest. It covers an area of 399,000 square kilometers (as of April 1956) and has a population of 7.3 million (as of April 1956). The capital is Tashkent. There is also the Kara-Kalpak Autonomous Republic within its borders.

Before the revolution, Uzbekistan was a backward colonial frontier region of Tsarist Russia. During the Soviet era, like other union republics, it has achieved tremendous progress in political, economic, and cultural development.

In terms of industry, Uzbekistan has established a highly developed, modern socialist industry. Compared with 1913, the total industrial output in 1955 increased thirteenfold. In the past, Uzbekistan had no metallurgical or machine-building industries. Now, it is able to produce metals and manufacture machinery such as excavators, cotton harvesters, lawnmowers, water pumps, ditchers, cranes, and textile machines. In 1913, Uzbekistan did not produce a single ton of coal. In 1955, the Angren coal mining area alone produced 2.6 million tons of coal. The oil production in 1913 totaled 13,000 tons, while in 1955 it was approximately one million tons. Electricity production has also increased 1,200 times. Currently, the republic's electricity production per capita is nine times higher than that of Turkey.

Fundamental changes have also taken place in agriculture. Compared with 1913, the irrigated area has expanded by 800,000 hectares. Cotton is Uzbekistan's most valuable asset, and production is increasing year by year. In 1913, the year with the highest cotton output before the revolution, 518,000 tons of seed cotton were produced, while in 1955, the output was 2.5 million tons. This year, it will reach 3 million tons, almost five times more than in 1913. Currently, the lint cotton produced by Uzbekistan is equal to the total output of cotton-producing countries such as Brazil, Pakistan, Turkey, and Iran. The production of silkworm cocoons is more than one-half greater than the combined output of Brazil, France, Turkey, Iran, Greece, Spain, Lebanon, Indochina, and the Belgian Congo. The republic ranks second in the world in terms of bast fiber crop production, second only to India.

With the rapid development of the national economy, Uzbekistan's cultural and educational undertakings have also greatly developed. Before the revolution, only 2% of the population was literate, mainly landlords and merchants. Now, the country has implemented seven-year universal education and established thirty-four universities and colleges. More than 1.3 million people are studying in ordinary secondary schools, more than 58,000 are studying in technical schools and other specialized schools, and more than 65,000 are studying in universities and colleges. On average, 81 out of every 10,000 people have a higher education degree, a proportion that is twice as high as in France, six times higher than in Turkey, and twenty-seven times higher than in Iran.

Science has also made great progress. Currently, there are approximately 6,000 scientific workers in Uzbekistan, including 187 doctors and 2,000 candidates for doctorate degrees. It has its own Academy of Sciences and approximately 100 scientific research institutions. Currently, the republic has 125,000 specialists with higher and secondary education working in various fields.

Before 1917, only one Uzbek-language newspaper was published in Uzbekistan. Now, 162 Uzbek-language and Kara-Kalpak-language newspapers are published, a number that is greater than the total number of newspapers in Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan combined.

Great progress has also been made in health care. The number of doctors alone has increased sixty-fourfold. The proportion of doctors to the population is higher than in capitalist countries such as the United Kingdom, France, and Japan.

In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, Uzbekistan's industrial, agricultural, cultural, and educational undertakings will have even greater development. The total industrial output will increase by about 60%. In agriculture, the main focus will continue to be the vigorous development of cotton cultivation. The total cotton output in 1960 is expected to reach 3.7 million tons. Reclaiming the Hungry Steppe and building canals such as the South Hungry Steppe Canal will irrigate and reclaim 200,000 hectares of land during the period of 1956-1962, transforming the Hungry Steppe into a major cotton-producing area.

    白金之国乌兹别克
    乌兹别克是一个盛产棉花的苏维埃共和国，它供应全苏联三分之二的棉花，向来有“白金之国”的称号。今天是乌兹别克人民建立苏维埃社会主义共和国和加入苏联的三十二周年纪念日。
    乌兹别克位于中亚细亚的中心，南面同阿富汗交界，东面同塔吉克和吉尔吉斯两个加盟共和国交界，北面同哈萨克加盟共和国交界，西南同土库曼加盟共和国交界。全国面积三十九万九千平方公里（据1956年4月统计数字），人口七百三十万人（据1956年4月统计数字）。首都是塔什干。国内还有一个卡拉—卡尔巴克自治共和国。
    革命以前，乌兹别克是沙皇俄国的一个落后的殖民边区，在苏维埃政权年代里，像其他加盟共和国一样，在政治、经济和文化发展方面获得了巨大的成就。
    在工业方面，乌兹别克已经建立了高度发展的、现代化的社会主义工业了。同1913年相比，1955年的工业总产量增加了十三倍。过去，乌兹别克没有冶金业和机器制造业。现在，已经能够生产金属，和制造挖土机、棉花收割机、割草机、水泵、挖沟机、起重机和纺织机等机器了。1913年的时候，乌兹别克斯坦境内连一吨煤也不生产，1955年光是安格连煤矿区就生产了二百六十万吨煤。1913年的石油产量总共是一万三千吨，1955年则约产一百万吨。电力生产也增加到一千二百倍。现在，共和国的电力生产按人口平均计算比土耳其多九倍。
    在农业方面也发生了根本变化。同1913年相比，灌溉面积扩大了八十万公顷。棉花是乌兹别克的最宝贵的财富，产量在逐年增加。革命前棉花产量最高的1913年是五十一万八千吨籽棉，而1955年的产量是二百五十万吨。今年将达三百万吨，差不多比1913年多五倍。目前，乌兹别克生产的皮棉等于巴西、巴基斯坦、土耳其和伊朗这些产棉国家的总和。蚕茧的产量比巴西、法国、土耳其、伊朗、希腊、西班牙、黎巴嫩、印度支那和比属刚果的产量总和还多二分之一以上。共和国的韧皮纤维作物的产量仅次于印度居世界第二位。
    随着国民经济的高涨，乌兹别克的文化教育事业也大大地发展了。革命以前只有2％的人是识字的，都是一些地主和商人。现在，国内已经实行了七年制普遍教育，建立了三十四所高等学校。在普通中等学校学习的有一百三十多万人，在技术学校和其他专门学校学习的有五万八千多人，在高等学校学习的有六万五千多人。平均每一万个人就有八十一个人有高等教育程度，这个比例比法国高一倍，比土耳其高六倍，比伊朗高二十七倍。
    科学也获得很大的发展。现在，乌兹别克的科学工作者约有六千人，其中有一百八十七名博士和两千名候补博士。有自己的科学院和约一百个科学研究机关。现在，共和国有十二万五千名受过高等和中等教育的专门人员在工作。
    1917年以前，乌兹别克斯坦境内只出版一种乌兹别克文的报纸，而现在出版乌兹别克文和卡拉—卡尔巴克文的报纸一百六十二种，这个数目比巴基斯坦、伊朗和阿富汗报纸的总和还多。
    在卫生保健事业方面也有很大发展。单是医生的数目就增加了六十四倍。医生在人口中的比例比英、法、日等资本主义国家还高。
    在第六个五年计划中，乌兹别克的工业、农业和文化教育事业将有更大的发展。工业总产量约增加60％。农业方面主要是继续大力发展植棉业，1960年的棉花总产量要达到三百七十万吨。开垦饥饿草原，修筑南饥饿草原运河等运河，在1956—1962年期间要灌溉和开垦二十万公顷的土地，把饥饿草原变成一个最大的产棉区。　（章叶）（附图片）
