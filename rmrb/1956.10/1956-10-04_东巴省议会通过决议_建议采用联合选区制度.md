Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 3rd -- The East Pakistan Provincial Assembly passed a resolution by an overwhelming majority on the evening of October 1st, suggesting to the National Assembly that elections for the National Assembly and the Provincial Assemblies should be held according to the joint electorate system.

Earlier, Khurshiduddin Ahmed of the Nizam-i-Islam Party put forward a proposal advocating the adoption of a separate electorate system. This proposal was rejected when put to a vote.

The separate electorate system stipulates that each religious group has its own representatives, and voters belonging to one religious group cannot vote for anyone outside their own religious group. Joint electorate means that Muslims, Hindus, and voters of other religions vote together. Many political leaders and newspapers in Pakistan believe that separate electorates discriminate against religious groups in minority positions.

Prior to this, the West Pakistan Assembly passed a resolution in August suggesting that the National Assembly adopt a separate electorate system. The National Assembly will discuss this issue when it meets in Dhaka this month.

    东巴省议会通过决议
    建议采用联合选区制度
    据新华社喀喇蚩3日讯　东巴基斯坦省议会10月1日晚以压倒多数通过决议，向国民议会建议说，国民议会和省议会的选举应当按照联合选区制度举行。
    早些时候，尼扎姆伊斯兰党的胡尔希杜丁·艾哈迈德提出了主张采用单独选区制度的提案。这项提案在付表决时被否决了。
    单独选区制度规定，各教族都有他们自己的代表，属于某一教族的选民不能投票选举他们自己教族以外的任何人。联合选区意味着，穆斯林、印度教徒和其他教族的选民在一起进行投票。巴基斯坦许多政治领袖和报纸认为单独选区是歧视处于少数地位的教族的主张。
    在这以前，西巴基斯坦议会在8月间曾经通过决议，建议国民议会采用单独选区制度。国民议会本月在达卡举行会议的时候将讨论这个问题。
