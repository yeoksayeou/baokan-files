    More on "Anthologies"
    Liu Dajie
    Anthologies are still needed today, especially anthologies of classical literature.
    As reference books for middle school language teachers, and as introductory reading material for young people who generally love classical literature, selecting the essence, adding annotations, and attaching a concise preface analyzing the writers and their works at the beginning of the volume still plays an important role in the popularization of classical literature. Complete collections are certainly good, but they are beyond the means of the average person. Ancient books are not punctuated, making them difficult to understand; a complete collection is very expensive, making it difficult to buy; and there is not enough time, making them difficult to read. Therefore, as introductory reading material for classical literature, "anthologies" are still needed.
    "If one wants to study literature or a certain writer, the so-called 'knowing the person and discussing the era,' then a useful anthology is hard to come by." From the perspective of knowing the person and discussing the era, and from the perspective of studying literary history or a certain writer, "anthologies" are of course not enough; it is necessary to read the complete works. Because "what anthologies display is often not the author's characteristics, but rather the selector's perspective." "Three Hundred Tang Poems" is something everyone has read, but Du Fu's masterpieces such as "Thinking on My Way from the Capital to Fengxian," the "Three Officials," the "Three Separations," "Qiang Village," and "Northern Expedition" were not selected; Bai Juyi's poems from "Qin Zhong Yin" and "New Yuefu" were also not selected. "Tang Poems Separately Judged," which was praised by predecessors, also has the same shortcomings. Using such anthologies as the standard for "studying literature or a certain writer" is of course wrong.
    Although ancient anthologies have many shortcomings, they are often very helpful in preserving historical materials. If there had been no "Wen Xuan" (Selections of Refined Literature), the Nineteen Old Poems would probably not have been passed down so easily; if there had been no "Yu Tai Xin Yong" (New Songs from the Jade Terrace), that outstanding folk narrative poem "Southeast Fly the Peacocks" would probably have been lost; if there had been no "Hua Jian Ji" (Among the Flowers Collection), those Five Dynasties lyrics would have been scattered. Even many of the Song and Yuan vernacular stories and operas have been passed down through anthologies.
    Our anthologies today should overcome the shortcomings of past anthologies. When selecting works, we should try to avoid the selector's subjectivity and one-sidedness as much as possible, and we must take into account comprehensiveness and representativeness. If the selector focuses exclusively on the concept of the people, seeing the people's nature too narrowly, and dares not select a single lyric poem, nor touch a single poem describing fields, gardens, or mountains and rivers, that is another kind of bias. The unity of thought and art, the combination of comprehensiveness and representativeness, is the main principle of anthologies.
    The annotation of works should be serious and conscientious, and should not be done carelessly. Although there is a foundation laid by predecessors, it is not enough to simply copy it again. On the basis of the predecessors, we must make selections and criticisms, supplements and developments, in order to meet the needs of today's readers.
    Good anthologies are still needed today. The problem is not with anthologies themselves, but with their quality.

    也谈“选本”
    刘大杰
    在今天，选本还是需要的，尤其是古典文学的选本。
    作为中学语文教师的参考书，作为一般爱好古典文学青年们的初步读物，选其精华，加以注释，再在卷头附以分析作家和作品的简明扼要的序言，在古典文学的普及工作上还有重要的作用。全集固然很好，非一般人所能负担。古书都没有断句，难懂；一部全集很贵，难买；时间不够，难读。因此，作为古典文学的初步读物，“选本”还是需要的。
    “倘要研究文学或某一作家，所谓‘知人论世’，那么，足以应用的选本就很难得”，鲁迅从知人论世，从研究文学史或某一个作家来说，“选本”当然是不够的，必要读全集。因为“选本所显示的，往往并非作者的特色，倒是选者的眼光”。“唐诗三百首”是大家读过的，杜甫的“自京赴奉先咏怀”，“三吏”、“三别”、“羌村”、“北征”一类的杰作，都没有入选；白居易的“秦中吟”和“新乐府”的诗篇，也都没有入选。前人称赞过的“唐诗别裁”，也有同样的缺点。用这种选本作为“研究文学或某一作家”的标准，那当然是错误的。
    古代选本虽有许多缺点，但在保存史料上往往很有好处。如果没有“文选”，古诗十九首恐怕不容易流传下来，没有“玉台新咏”，“孔雀东南飞”那首杰出的民间叙事诗，恐怕也就失传了，没有“花间集”，五代那些词也会散失了吧。就是宋元的话本戏曲，有许多也是依赖选本流传下来的。
    我们今天的选本，应该克服过去选本的缺点，在挑选作品时，要尽量避免选家的主观与片面，必要顾到全面性与代表性。如果选家专心注意于人民性的概念，把人民性看得过于窄狭，抒情诗一首也不敢选，描写田园山水的诗一首也不敢碰，那又是一种偏向。思想与艺术的统一，全面性与代表性的结合，是选本的主要原则。
    作品的注释，要严肃认真，不可草率从事。虽有前人的底子，并不是照抄一遍就可以了事的。还要在前人的基础上，有所选择和批判，有所补充和发挥，才合于今日读者的需要。
    好的选本，在今天还是需要的。问题不在于选本，而在于质量。
