    Life in West Berlin
    Zhang Pei
    During my stay in Leipzig, we went one night to see a new film from the German Democratic Republic called "The Girl from Berlin." The film depicts a young girl from a working-class family in democratic Berlin who goes to West Berlin for a stroll. She discovers that the shop windows in West Berlin are filled with all sorts of bizarre consumer goods, the neon lights on the tall buildings are dazzling, and there are bars and jazz music everywhere, with men wearing brightly colored clothes. "Life in West Berlin is really good!" This decadent Western lifestyle tempts the inexperienced young girl. She quickly meets two young men in the park, one a hooligan and the other an auto mechanic. The girl has a good eye and falls in love with the worker who lives by his own labor. From then on, she goes to West Berlin frequently, always playing until late at night before returning. One time, she didn't return home until the next morning. Her mother criticized her severely, and in a fit of anger, the girl grabbed her small suitcase and ran quickly to the station, taking the elevated train to West Berlin. In her view, life in West Berlin was good, and she had the man she loved. She could marry him immediately and never return to this "unfree" home.
    But when she hurriedly found the young worker, she found him with a bandaged hand, looking worried and saying nothing. It turned out that while drinking and dancing in a bar, he had gotten into a fight with a capitalist because he couldn't stand the capitalist's ridicule, and as a result, he was thrown out of the bar and injured by the capitalist's thugs. A few days later, the factory laid off workers, and he lost his job. Now he was starving himself, so of course, he couldn't marry her and support her. For this girl who was full of happy fantasies, it was like a bolt from the blue, but ultimately it was the truth. After going hungry for a day, the girl returned to her home in democratic Berlin with her suitcase, eating the rich dinner her mother had prepared for her with big mouthfuls. She wiped away her tears and smiled again.
    I don't understand German, so I can't understand the details of this film, but it is very easy to understand because it is a common and real phenomenon in Berlin life today.
    On the one hand, Western imperialists have set up all kinds of special agent and spy organizations in West Berlin to carry out despicable sabotage against the democratic districts of Berlin and the German Democratic Republic; on the other hand, they give West Berlin "special treatment" economically, trying their best to decorate West Berlin superficially. They openly say that "West Berlin is a window of the Western capitalist world," with the aim of using the conditions of free movement between East and West Berlin to deceive and seduce the residents of the democratic districts of Berlin and the German Democratic Republic. But a bloated fat man with chronic illness cannot hide his deep-rooted disease. Like the girl in the movie, some people initially feel that life in West Berlin seems richer and more comfortable than life in democratic Berlin, but before long, people see through this false appearance.
    Of course, this is not to say that the Western imperialists' tricks have no gain at all. Some ignorant people who admire the "Western way of life" run to West Berlin, thinking that as long as they get to West Berlin, they will quickly find a job, earn a lot of money, and enjoy themselves comfortably. But the truth is another matter. Finding a job there is not as easy as imagined. Currently, there are still a large number of unemployed and underemployed workers in West Berlin. Even if you find a job, the income will not allow you to live "comfortably." In West Berlin, there are indeed some rich people who spend money like water and are extremely debauched. They rode on the heads of the people during the Hitler era, and now they have found the same "happiness" under the protection of Adenauer and the Western imperialists, but that is not the case for ordinary workers.
    So some people run back, having received a practical education. I made a visit to the home of female worker Wigner, who lives on the eighth floor of No. 153 Stalin Avenue. Wigner is a female worker with sixteen years of experience at the Katznan Electric Factory in Berlin. I don't want to talk too much about how comfortable and elegant this female worker's house is. I just want to mention two interesting things Wigner told me.
    In the workshop where Wigner works, there are two young workers, both eighteen years old, who, believing the instigation of bad people, quietly left the factory and went to West Berlin, like the young girl in the movie.
    These two young men wandered the streets of West Berlin for many days, and the money in their pockets ran out, but there was no place to accommodate their work. The music in the bars was fascinating, but they could only watch from the door. Here, if you don't have a lot of marks in your pocket, no one will pay attention to you. These two young men "learned a lesson" in West Berlin and came back. The factory did not severely reprimand them, but still allowed them to work in the workshop. At this time, they realized: "It's better here with us!"
    There is also a female worker in this factory who ran to the west in order to "live more comfortably." She was luckier than the two young men, and she found a job. However, she was very miserable. There, she could only earn forty marks a week (in democratic Berlin, she could earn at least ninety marks a week), for a total of only one hundred and sixty marks a month, but the rent she paid for her house was seventy marks a month (in democratic Berlin, the same house would only cost a dozen marks a month). She couldn't bear this kind of "comfortable" life, so she returned to her own factory in democratic Berlin.
    These people all have names and surnames. I originally wanted to visit them and ask them to talk about their feelings, but because I didn't have time, I couldn't carry out this interesting visit. However, Wigner's narrative is enough to convince me of the truthfulness of the film "The Girl from Berlin."
    Later, during my visit to Berlin, I encountered a good opportunity to specifically understand life in West Berlin. At the Stalin Electric Factory, I met the clerk, Okter. He is a plump middle-aged man of forty-nine, and a long-time resident of West Berlin. He has lived in the Wedding district (now the French occupation zone) for almost twenty years, but he couldn't find a job in West Berlin, so he had to come to democratic Berlin for employment. He has to spend ninety minutes each day traveling back and forth between East and West Berlin. There are more than 10,000 West Berliners like Okter. They live in West Berlin and come to East Berlin to work every day.
    Okter started by talking about the prices in West Berlin.
    Ordinary families are most concerned about food prices. Okter can say the detailed price of every food item without thinking. Because he works in the democratic district of Berlin, it is also easy for him to compare.
    "Since this year, the prices of various foods in West Berlin have been rising. Bread has risen from 90 pfennigs per kilogram to 1 mark and 5 pfennigs, but in democratic Berlin, bread is only 55 pfennigs per kilogram. The price of meat has increased by 50 to 70 pfennigs per kilogram. Potatoes were 65 pfennigs for every five kilograms last October, and this year it has risen to 1 mark and 20 pfennigs."
      "Rent has increased by 10% since January 1 this year, but the capitalists in West Berlin are not satisfied and are now brewing to increase it to 130%."
    "Public transportation has also increased in price since July 1. Tram tickets have increased from 25 pfennigs to 30 pfennigs, and bus tickets have increased from 35 pfennigs to 40 pfennigs. In this way, each worker will have to spend an additional seven marks each month. In democratic Berlin, tram tickets are only 20 pfennigs, and bus tickets are only 30 pfennigs."
    Okter also cited many examples of rising prices.
    "Why are prices constantly rising? The Adenauer government has found many excuses to deceive the people, such as the winter being too cold last year. But everyone is very clear that the whole of Europe was cold last winter, but prices in democratic Berlin have been stable, and there has even been a general price reduction this year. The real reason for the rising prices is that the Adenauer government wants to rearm and build an army. Therefore, recently, a wave of opposition to the conscription law has been sweeping across West Berlin and throughout West Germany."
    Okter also talked about the false prosperity of West Berlin and its deep-rooted illnesses.
    "The West Berlin government has not built housing for workers at all. A small number of houses are built by capitalists, but the working people cannot afford such houses, because before moving in, they must first pay a deposit of two to three thousand marks. But an ordinary worker in West Berlin only earns two hundred marks a month, and the monthly rent is one mark and thirty pfennigs per square meter. In democratic Berlin, there is no need to pay any deposit at all, and the rent, such as for good housing like on Stalin Avenue, is only ninety pfennigs per square meter per month."
    Here I would like to add one point that Okter did not mention: In the democratic district of Berlin, a large part of the houses built after the war are employee dormitories. The largest construction project in the second five-year plan of the democratic district of Berlin is residential construction. In West Berlin, the city government has no such plan at all.
    "West Berlin has preserved all the bad systems of capitalism, such as equal pay for equal work for men and women. Not to mention this, the most important thing is that there is no guarantee of work. The unemployed cannot find work, and those who have work may lose their jobs at any time. Because the number of workers employed by capitalists changes with the level of profits and changes in the market."
      "As for the social life in West Berlin, it is becoming more and more 'Americanized' every day. American films depicting murder, robbery, and pornography are filling various cinemas. The American 'boogie-woogie' dance music is popular in cafes and bars. Americans swagger around in West Berlin, doing whatever they want. Not only do the Germans in West Berlin dislike this, but even the French in the French occupation zone find it a bit outrageous. Not long ago, the French occupying forces notified the Americans to not come to the French occupation zone."
    This is an honest conversation from a long-time resident of West Berlin.
    There is only one Berlin, but two different social systems exist in Berlin. Facts will increasingly prompt people to recognize which system is good and which is not. In the peaceful competition, one side will eventually win. The development of history has proven and will continue to prove that the winner will be socialism.

    西柏林的生活
    张沛
    在来比锡停留期间的一个夜晚，我们去看了一部德意志民主共和国新出的名叫“柏林姑娘”的影片。这部影片是描写民主柏林的一个工人家庭的年轻姑娘，有一次到西柏林去游逛，她发现西柏林商店的橱窗里，陈列着很多奇形怪状的消费品，高楼上的霓虹灯也多得耀眼，到处都是酒吧和爵士音乐，男人穿的衣服也是花花绿绿的。“西柏林的生活真是不错啊！”这种纸醉金迷的西方色彩的生活，诱惑着这个没有经验的年轻姑娘。她很快地在公园里结识了两个男青年，一个是流氓，一个是汽车修配厂的工人。这个姑娘的眼力还算不错，爱上了这个靠自己劳动生活的工人。从此，她就经常到西柏林去，每次都玩到深夜才回来。有一次她第二天早晨才回家。她的母亲狠狠地批评了她，这个姑娘在一气之下就提着小箱子，飞快地跑到车站，乘着高架电车到西柏林去了。在她看来，西柏林生活好，又有她心爱的人，她可以马上同他结婚，再也不回这个不“自由”的家了。
    可是当她急匆匆地找到那个青年工人时，她发现他一只手吊着绷带，愁眉苦脸地不说一句话。原来他在酒吧间喝酒跳舞时，因为受不了一个资本家的嘲弄，和资本家发生了殴斗，结果被资本家左右的流氓从酒吧扔出来受伤了。没有几天，工厂解雇工人，他又失业了。现在他自己还饿着肚子，当然不可能和她结婚养活她了。对于这个充满着幸福幻想的姑娘来说，这简直是晴天霹雳，但终究这是事实。在挨了一天饿以后，这个姑娘又提着箱子回到民主柏林自己的家，大口大口地吃着母亲为她准备的丰富的晚餐。她擦干了眼泪又笑了。
    我不懂德文，无法了解这部影片的细节，但是它又非常容易使你了解，因为这是今天柏林生活中一个平常而真实的现象。
    西方帝国主义分子，一方面在西柏林设立了各式各样的特务间谍机构，对柏林民主区和民主德国进行卑鄙的破坏；一方面从经济上给西柏林以“特殊待遇”，尽力从表面上把西柏林装璜起来。他们公开说“西柏林是西方资本主义世界的橱窗”，目的是利用东西柏林自由往来的条件，来欺骗、勾引柏林民主区和民主德国的居民。可是一个有着沉疴的虚胖子，是无法掩盖它的根深蒂固的病症的。像这个电影中的姑娘一样，起初有些人觉得西柏林的生活似乎比民主柏林的生活要丰富些舒服些，可是不要多久，人们就看穿了这种虚假的景象。
    当然这不是说西方帝国主义者的骗局就没有一点收获，一些无知的羡慕“西方生活方式”的人，跑到西柏林去，以为只要到了西柏林，很快就会找到工作，可以挣很多钱，可以舒舒服服地享受。可是事实呢，是另外一回事。在那里找工作，并不是如想像中那样容易，目前西柏林还有大量的失业与半失业的工人。就是找到了工作，收入也不能使你生活得“舒舒服服”。在西柏林确实有一些挥金如土、荒淫无度的富豪，他们在希特勒时代就骑在人民头上，他们现在在阿登纳和西方帝国主义分子庇护下找到了同样的“快乐”，但那不是普通的劳动者。
    于是有些人又跑回来了，他们受到了一次实际的教育。在斯大林大街一百五十三号第八楼女工维格娜的家里，我作了一次访问。维格娜是柏林卡兹南电机工厂一个有着十六年工龄的女工，我不想多谈这个女工住的房子是多么舒适和讲究，我只想提一下维格娜告诉我的两件有趣的事。
    在维格娜工作的车间内，有两个都是十八岁的青年工人，他们轻信了坏人的鼓动，和那个电影中的年轻姑娘一样，悄悄地离开了工厂到西柏林去了。
    这两个青年人在西柏林的大街上流浪了好些天，口袋里的钱花光了，可是没有地方容纳他们工作。酒吧间的音乐很迷人，但是只能在门口张望。在这里，口袋里没有大把的马克，谁也不会理你。这两个青年人到西柏林“上了一课”，又回来了。工厂并没有严厉责备他们，还是让他们在车间内工作。这时他们认识到：“还是我们这里好呵！”
    这个工厂还有一个女工，也是为了“生活得更舒服些”跑到西边去了。她比这两个青年幸运，她找到了工作。然而可怜得很。在那儿每周她只能收入四十个马克（在民主柏林，最少每周可收入九十个马克），一个月总起来只是一百六十个马克，可是她租的房子，一个月就得付七十个马克（在民主柏林，同样的一间房子，每月只需要付十几个马克）。她没有办法忍受这种“舒服”的生活，于是又回到民主柏林自己的工厂。
    这几个人都是有名有姓的。我本来想去访问他们，请他们谈一谈自己的感想，可是因为没有时间，不能进行这次有趣的访问。然而维格娜的叙述，已经足以使我相信“柏林姑娘”这部影片的真实性。
    此后，我在柏林的访问中，遇到了一个具体了解西柏林生活的好机会。在斯大林电器工厂里，我会见了办事员奥克特。他是一个四十九岁的胖胖的中年人，是西柏林的老居民。他在维丁区（现在是法国占领区）差不多已住了二十年，可是他在西柏林找不到工作，只好到民主柏林来就业。他每天得花费九十分钟的时间，来回于东西柏林之间。像奥克特这样的西柏林人有一万多。他们家住在西柏林，每天到东柏林来工作。
    奥克特先从物价谈起西柏林的生活。
    普通的家庭最关心的首先是食品的价格。奥克特不用思索就可以说出每一样食品的详细价格。他因为在柏林民主区工作，所以也很容易比较。
    “今年以来，西柏林各种食品都在涨价。面包由每公斤九十芬尼涨到一马克零五芬尼，可是在民主柏林每公斤面包只要五十五个芬尼。肉的价格每公斤提高了五十到七十芬尼。土豆在去年十月是每五公斤六十五芬尼，今年一下涨一马克二十芬尼。”
      “房租从今年一月一日起上涨了10％，可是西柏林的资本家还不满意，现在正酝酿要上涨到130％。”
    “公共交通从七月一日起也涨价了，电车票从二十五芬尼涨到三十芬尼，公共汽车票从三十五芬尼涨到四十芬尼。这样，每个工人，每月要多支出七个马克。而在民主柏林，电车票只要二十芬尼，公共汽车票只要三十芬尼。”
    奥克特还举了很多物品涨价的例子。
    “物价为什么不断上涨呢？阿登纳政府找了许多借口来欺骗人民，比如说是去年冬天太冷呀。可是大家都很清楚，去冬整个欧洲都很冷，可是民主柏林物价一直稳定，而且今年还进行了一次普遍的减价。物价上涨的真正原因是阿登纳政府要重新武装，建立军队。所以最近以来，在西柏林，在整个西德，普遍掀起了反对兵役法的浪潮。”
    奥克特也谈到西柏林的虚假繁荣和它的根深蒂固的病症。
    “西柏林政府根本没有为工人修建住宅。少量的住宅是资本家修的，但是劳动人民住不起这样的房子，因为在住进去以前，要先缴二千到三千马克的定金。可是一个普通工人，在西柏林每月的工资只有二百个马克，每月的房租是每平方公尺一马克三十芬尼。在民主柏林根本不需要缴什么定金，而房租呢，像斯大林大街那样好的住宅，每平方公尺每月只需缴九十芬尼。”
    在这里我想再补充奥克特所没有谈到的一点情况：在柏林民主区，战后新建的房屋很大的部分是职工宿舍。柏林民主区第二个五年计划中最庞大的建筑计划是住宅建筑。而在西柏林，市政府根本没有这样的计划。
    “在西柏林保存了一切资本主义的坏制度，如男女同工不同酬等。这且不说，最重要的是工作没有保证，失业的人找不到工作，工作的人随时有失业的可能。因为资本家雇用工人的数目是随着利润的高低和市场的变化而变化的。”
      “至于西柏林的社会生活，一天比一天‘美国化’了。美国的描写杀人、抢劫、色情的影片充斥了各个电影院。咖啡店、酒巴间流行的是美国‘勃基，勃基’的跳舞音乐。美国人在西柏林耀武扬威，为非作歹，不仅西柏林的德国人看不顺眼，就连法国占领区的法国人，也觉得不大像话。不久以前法国占领军通知美国人，要他们不要到法国占领区来。”
    这是西柏林的一个老居民诚实的谈话。
    柏林只有一个，但是在柏林存在两种不同的社会制度，事实将一天比一天促使人民认识到哪一种制度好，哪一种制度不好。在和平竞赛中终有一方获胜，历史的发展已经证实，还将继续证实，胜利者必将是社会主义。
