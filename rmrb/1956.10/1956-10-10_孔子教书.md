　　Confucius Teaches
　　Liu Dajie
    In some respects, Confucius was a good teacher. His educational philosophy of "teaching without discrimination," his passionate dedication to work to the point of "being so engrossed in learning that he forgets to eat, unaware of the approach of old age," and his efforts in organizing the cultural heritage of the motherland are all shining aspects of his legacy. The Confucius of the Han Dynasty and later periods, distorted beyond recognition, was a figure painted and adorned by later generations, bearing no relation to Confucius himself; the original Confucius has many aspects worth learning from today.

    At the very beginning of the "Analects," he tells his students: "To learn and at due times to repeat what one has learnt, is that not after all a pleasure?" This is very good. He also said: "When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them," "Reviewing what you have learned and learning something new," "To know when you know, and to know when you do not know, that is knowledge," "When I walk along with two others, they may serve me as my teachers." These teachings still have significance and freshness in our new society today.

    Confucius had three thousand students, almost equivalent to a comprehensive university, truly a widespread influence. Confucius had several characteristics in his teaching. First, he paid attention to the cultivation of moral character. He repeatedly praised Yan Hui's and Zeng Shen's excellent qualities of living frugally and studying diligently. He severely rebuked Zai Yu for being lazy and boastful, calling him a piece of rotten wood that could not be carved. He lamented, "At first, my way of dealing with men was to listen to their words, and give them credit for their conduct. Now I listen to their words, and observe their conduct." This educated not only Zai Yu but also us.

    Secondly, Confucius's teaching enabled him to understand the students’ strengths and weaknesses, as well as their talents and personalities. Confucius often mentioned Zeng Shen's virtue, Zi Lu's courage, Yan Hui's eagerness to learn, and Zi Gong's intelligence. Once, Meng Wu Bo asked Confucius, "What about Ran Qiu?" Confucius said, "He can be a county magistrate." He then asked, "What about Zi Lu?" Confucius said, "He can be a director of the land tax bureau." He then asked, "What about Gongxi Chi?" Confucius said, "Gongxi Chi? When he puts on his ceremonial robes to receive foreign guests, he's absolutely first-rate!" Confucius understood the students' situations so clearly that it would have been very convenient during unified assignments. Today, some of us are not like that. When the personnel department asks us about our graduates, who is good as an assistant teacher, who is good as a graduate student, who is good as an editor? I myself cannot answer.

    An important characteristic of Confucius's teaching is that he paid attention to cultivating students' ability to think independently. Confucius taught young people to learn, and even more to think. He wanted them to digest and absorb what they had learned, think about it carefully, and then create new things. "Reviewing what you have learned" is not just copying notes and memorizing notes to get a five on an exam; the main thing is to "learn something new." "Learning something new" comes from the process of thinking, discovering, and creating. Only in this way can academic research achieve success. Confucius liked Yan Hui so much because Yan Hui had a strong ability to think; he could "infer ten things from one." It is certainly difficult to infer ten things from one, but if young students can only infer one thing from one thing, then our teaching is a failure. However, today, the situation of inferring only one thing from one thing is not uncommon. Having taught "East Mountain," they understand "East Mountain"; without teaching "Picking Ferns," they don't understand "Picking Ferns"; having taught "Three Officials," they understand "Three Officials"; without teaching "Three Separations," they don't understand "Three Separations." Without cultivating students' spirit of diligent study and independent thinking ability, one cannot "review what one has learned and learn something new." When Zixia talked about the poem "How lovely her artful smile," and Zigong talked about "To be poor without flattery, to be rich without arrogance," Confucius smiled and was extremely happy, seeing that his brilliant students could use their independent thinking ability and have new inspirations and insights. Therefore, Confucius said: "Learning without thinking is labor lost."

    Learning without thinking is certainly not good, but thinking without learning is also incorrect. This summer vacation, the university's teaching plan was revised, class hours were reduced, and the learning environment was improved. Will it be the case from now on that we will simply "learn less and think more" or "not learn and only think"? Such ideas are all wrong. If so, that would be "empty thinking," "one-sided thinking," "piecemeal thinking," "thinking without content," and nothing will come of it. We must develop our thinking ability on the basis of diligent learning and rich knowledge in order to make choices, criticize, and create. We must have real insights in the repetitive process of learning and thinking, thinking and learning; we must dialectically unify learning and thinking in order to have real achievements. We need to read more original materials, and we need to use reference books more often. We need to delve deeply and then climb out of it. Therefore, Confucius said: "Thinking without learning is perilous."

### 孔子教书

　　孔子教书
　　刘大杰
    从某些方面说，孔子是一个好教师。“有教无类”的教育思想，“发愤忘食，不知老之将至”的劳动热情，祖国文化遗产的整理工作等等，都是他的光辉面。汉朝及其以后的孔子，弄得面目全非，那是后人给他化了装，涂了油彩，与孔子本人无关；原始的孔子，有许多地方值得我们学习。
    在“论语”一开始，他就对学生们说：“学而时习之，不亦说乎”！这就好得很。他又说：“过则勿惮改”，又说：“温故而知新”，又说：“知之为知之，不知为不知”，又说：“三人行必有我师焉”，这些教训，放在我们今天的新社会里，还很有意义，还很新鲜。
    孔子有三千学生，差不多等于一所综合性的大学，真是桃李满天下。孔子教书有好些特点。首先他是注意道德品质的培养。颜回、曾参的粗衣淡饭刻苦钻研的优良品质，孔子一再表扬。宰予懒惰，夸夸其谈，孔子严厉地责备过他，说他是一块不可雕饰的烂木头。并且感叹地说：“我从前对于人，听了他的谈话，就相信他的行为；现在我对于人，听了他的谈话，还要看看他的行为”。这不仅教育了宰予，也教育了我们。
    其次，孔子教书能了解学生们的优缺点以及他们的特长和个性。曾参的德，子路的勇，颜回的好学，子贡的聪明，孔子常常提出来。孟武伯有一次问孔子：“冉求怎样呢？”孔子说：“可以做个县长”；又问：“子路如何呢？”孔子说：“可以做个田赋局长”；又问：“公西赤如何呢？”孔子说：“公西赤吗？他穿起礼服来，招待外宾，那是刮刮叫的！”孔子对于学生情况了解得那样清楚，等到统一分配的时候，那是多么方便。今天我们有些人就不然。人事科问到我们的毕业学生，谁当助教好，谁作研究生好，谁做编辑好？……我自己就回答不出来。
    孔子教书的重要特点，是注意培养学生的独立思考能力。孔子教青年们学，更教他们思。要他们把学到的东西消化吸收，加以细细地思考，再创造出新的东西来。“温故”不只是抄笔记，背笔记，图考一个五分，主要的是“知新”；“知新”是从思考的过程中有所发现有所创造，必要这样学术研究才有成就。孔子那样欢喜颜回，就是因为颜回的思考能力强，他能“闻一以知十”。闻一知十固然很难，如果青年学生只能闻一知一，那我们教书是失败的。然而在今天，闻一知一的情形郤不是没有。教了“东山”就懂“东山”，不教“采薇”，就不懂“采薇”；教了“三吏”，就懂“三吏”，不教“三别”，就不懂“三别”。没有培养学生们刻苦钻研的精神和独立思考的能力，就不能“温故而知新”。子夏谈“巧笑倩兮”那首诗，子贡谈“贫而无?，富而无骄”的时候，孔子笑容满面，高兴极了，看见高足们能运用独立思考能力，有了新的启发和见解。所以孔子说：“学而不思则罔。”
    学而不思固然不好，思而不学也是不正确的。今年暑假开始，大学的教学计划修改了，学时减少了，学习的环境改善了。是不是以后只是“少学而多思”或是“不学而专思”呢？这种想法都是不对的。如果这样那就是“空思”、“单思”、“片面思”、“没有内容的思”，是思不出什么东西来的。我们必要在勤苦学习的基础上，在丰富知识的基础上，发挥思考能力，才能有所去取，有所批判，有所创造。我们必要在学习、思考，思考、学习的反复过程中，才能有真的创见；我们必要把学习、思考辩证地统一起来，才能有真的成就。我们要多读原始材料，要多使用工具书；要钻得进去，又要爬得出来。所以孔子说：“思而不学则殆。”
