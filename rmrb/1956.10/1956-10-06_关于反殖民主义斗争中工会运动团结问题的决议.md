Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, October 4th: The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Council, at its 8th session, adopted a resolution on the fraternal solidarity of the trade union movement and working people in countries that have achieved or are striving for independence in the anti-colonialist struggle.

The resolution points out that in recent years, the struggle of the people of various countries to achieve or consolidate independence has reached a new high. The surge of the anti-colonialist struggle and the active participation of the broad masses of people in this struggle have created favorable conditions for the large-scale development of the trade union movement.

The Council affirms that the trade union movement is strengthened on the basis of unity in many countries struggling against colonialism.

Therefore, all trade unions should support the peace-loving and anti-colonialist foreign policies implemented in various regions of the world, and on domestic policy issues, they should defend all measures taken to consolidate the unity of national forces, promote democracy, and strengthen national industry. Obviously, at the same time, they should strive to protect the interests of the working people.

The forms of struggle chosen by trade unions should be flexible and diverse, and the best way to adopt any form is to consider the specific situation of each country and industry, and to consider whether the activities of the enterprise serve the interests of imperialism or the interests of the nation.

The resolution states that unity is an important condition for victory in the struggle against colonialism. Despite differences in ideology, politics, and religious beliefs, the unity of trade unions can be achieved.

The WFTU Council points out that the great movement of fraternal solidarity of the working people of all countries, determined by the anti-colonialist struggle, will inevitably develop. The Council believes that this movement is a fundamental characteristic of the international trade union movement in the present era, and that the anti-colonialist struggle of the people of all countries is closely related to the consolidation of peace. Solidarity in the struggle for peace and against colonialism is interconnected. The solidarity of the working people of the colonial powers is very important to the working people of the oppressed countries. Their struggle is also an important contribution to the struggle of the entire international working class.

The resolution goes on to point out that the anti-colonialist struggle is a huge factor in improving relations between all trade unions in countries that have achieved independence or are striving for independence. The proposal to convene a conference of Asian and African trade union representatives is a very clear proof of the gradual spread among the working people and trade unions of the countries concerned.

The Council hopes that trade unions in Asian and African countries of all tendencies can achieve broader unity in order to play their united role with greater force in the struggle against colonialism, in defense of peace, and in improving the living conditions of the working people.

The Council believes that the WFTU, faithful to its principles, should further strengthen the struggle against colonialism, that is: to promote the solidarity between workers and trade union organizations in various countries and anti-colonial trade union organizations in a timely and more active manner;

In this struggle, strengthen solidarity with organizations participating in other international trade union centers and independent trade union organizations; strive to develop the exchange of delegations of national trade union federations, professional trade unions, and working people between the least developed countries, as well as between these countries and industrialized capitalist and socialist countries, and strengthen direct contact between trade union leaders of various tendencies;

Improve the work of the press, propaganda, and education against colonialism.

The resolution concludes by saying that the WFTU Council believes that the trade union movement in countries that have achieved independence or are striving for independence has broad prospects for promoting unity, and that the fraternal solidarity among all working people and friendly cooperation among all trade unions will be strengthened. This will create conditions for achieving decisive victories in the anti-colonialist struggle, which is an important factor in the universal struggle of the working people for peace, freedom, and social progress.

    关于反殖民主义斗争中工会运动团结问题的决议
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社索非亚4日讯：世界工会联合会理事会第八次会议就已经争取到独立、或者正在争取独立的国家的工会运动和劳动人民在反殖民主义斗争中的兄弟团结问题通过一项决议。
    决议指出，近年来，各国人民争取或者是巩固独立的斗争达到了新的高潮。而反殖民主义斗争的高涨和广大人民群众的积极参加这个斗争，为大规模发展工会运动创造了良好的条件。
    理事会确认，工会运动是在为反对殖民主义而斗争的许多国家团结一致的基础上加强起来的。
    因此，各工会应当支持世界各个地区所实行的爱好和平的和反殖民主义的外交政策，而在国内政策问题上应当捍卫为巩固各民族力量的团结一致、发扬民主和加强民族工业所实行的一切措施。显然，同时它们应当为保护劳动人民的利益而奋斗。
    工会所选择的斗争形式应当是灵活的和多种多样的，至于采用哪种形式，最好是考虑到每一个国家和产业部门的具体情况，以及考虑到这一企业的活动是为帝国主义利益服务，还是为民族利益服务。
    决议说，在反对殖民主义的斗争中，团结是胜利的重要条件。尽管思想意识、政治和宗教信仰的性质有所不同，但是工会的团结是可以实现的。
    世界工联理事会指出，反殖民主义的斗争确定了各国劳动人民兄弟团结的巨大运动必然得到发展。理事会认为，这个运动是现时代国际工会运动的基本特点，各国人民反殖民主义的斗争是同巩固和平密切相关的。在争取和平和反对殖民主义的斗争中，团结具有互相关连的性质。宗主国劳动人民的团结对被压迫的国家的劳动人民是非常重要的。它们的斗争也就是对整个国际工人阶级斗争的重要贡献。
    决议接着指出，反殖民主义的斗争是改善已经取得独立或者是正在争取独立的国家的所有工会之间关系的巨大因素。召开亚非工会代表会议的主张逐渐在有关国家的劳动人民和工会中间传播开来就是一个非常清楚的证明。
    理事会希望，不论何种倾向的亚非各国工会能够取得更加广泛的联合，以便以更大的力量在反对殖民主义、捍卫和平和改善劳动人民生活条件的斗争中发挥自己的团结作用。
    理事会认为，忠实于自己的原则的世界工联，应该更加加强反对殖民主义的斗争，这就是：及时而且更加积极地促进各国工人和工会组织同各个反殖民主义工会组织之间的团结；
    在这个斗争中，加强同参加其他国际工会中心的组织和独立工会组织的团结；力求在最不发达的国家之间，以及这些国家同工业化的资本主义和社会主义国家之间，发展互派全国工会联合会、专业工会和劳动人民代表团的工作，加强各种倾向的工会领导人的直接接触；
    改善反对殖民主义的报刊、宣传和教育方面的工作。
    决议最后说，世界工联理事会相信，已经取得独立或是正在争取独立的国家的工会运动在发扬团结一致方面具有广阔的前景，全体劳动人民之间的兄弟团结和一切工会之间的友好合作将加强起来。这将为在反殖民主义斗争中取得决定性的胜利创造条件，而这种斗争是劳动人民争取和平、自由和社会进步的普遍斗争中的重要因素。
