    Let All Party Members Become Active
    Liu Qingyun
    Zhaizi District, Qidong County, Shandong Province, Zhuangli Township, has realized the full socialist agricultural collectivization. All one hundred and four Party members in the township have joined agricultural cooperatives, and most of them are working actively, holding leadership positions such as cooperative directors, committee members, and team leaders. However, there are still twenty-five Party members who are not active in their work. Why is this? It turns out that some of these Party members are old and frail and cannot do heavy work; some are women who cannot spare the time because they have many children; some have low political morale due to difficult family lives; some have made mistakes and been punished in the past, and have been neglected for a long time, resulting in dissatisfaction with the Party; some actively took the lead in selling excessive grain during the grain unified purchase movement, but later, the cadres not only did not solve their grain supply problems but also criticized them, thus dampening their enthusiasm; there are also individual Party members who are complacent because of their past merits, or who have developed capitalist ideas due to their rising economic status. If the enthusiasm of these Party members cannot be mobilized, it will be detrimental to increasing cooperative production and increasing the income of cooperative members.
    However, in the past, the leadership of the township's Party branch had a very poor understanding of this point. Not only did they not think of ways to mobilize the enthusiasm of these Party members, but they also wanted to kick them out. Zhai Derong, the secretary of the township branch, once said: "Keeping these Party members is useless, let's expel them quickly." Zhang Huaixi, a member of the township branch committee, also said: "Our village has seven or eight backward Party members, it's impossible to manage them, let's get rid of them quickly and be done with it." After the publication of the "People's Daily" editorial "Help Backward Party Members Become Active" on July 7th this year, it began to attract the attention of the township branch. They seriously studied it and conducted research on the "backward" Party members one by one. It turned out that twenty of these twenty-five Party members joined the Party before 1946, and fourteen of them had served as village chiefs, peasant association chairmen, and militia captains. In the past, they were not only active in their work but also made certain contributions to the Party. Why are they now passive in their work? The branch committee members unanimously believed that the main reason was that there were many shortcomings in the work of the branch, and there was not enough education, help, and care for them. In the past, the branch did not analyze the reasons for their passive work, did not check the leadership's responsibilities, and criticized them too much and demanded too much of them. For example, Party member Li Guangliang only has himself and his eighty-year-old mother at home. In addition to working in the fields, he also has to cook, grind grain, and take care of his mother. Because he is busy with housework, he not only cannot attend Party meetings sometimes, but also the grain he harvested after working for a whole winter and spring is not enough to eat. The branch not only did not help him overcome these practical difficulties but also criticized him for being ideologically backward and not active in his work. Zhai Derong, the secretary of the township branch, reviewed: "We haven't conducted any Party education for Party members in half a year, we only want Party members to complete tasks, and we don't help them overcome practical difficulties, how can they work actively?" Qiao Yufeng, a member of the township branch committee, said: "Our branch only held one branch meeting last year, and there were arguments, criticism cannot be carried out within the Party, and Party members' shortcomings cannot be corrected in time." Qin Yuanxiang, a member of the township branch committee, said: "We cannot kick out older Party members either. Li Guangyi led a large cart team to support the front during the War of Liberation, he was not afraid of hardship and worked very actively. Now that he is old, his work is not as active as before. In addition to educating him, the branch should also assign him work according to his specific situation."
    After the branch committee unified its understanding, it convened a forum for those Party members who were not working actively. At the meeting, Zhai Derong, the secretary of the township branch, represented the branch committee in affirming their past achievements and educated them in light of their ideological situation. He reviewed the fact that the branch committee had not provided enough education and care for them in the past and had not handled certain issues properly. As a result, eight of the twenty-one Party members who attended the meeting not only raised some opinions to the branch committee but also made self-criticisms, expressing their attitude. Party member Tian Huaiyun was a veteran who had been transferred to civilian work. After returning home, he had a complacent attitude as a meritorious person and did not work actively. After attending the forum, he realized his shortcomings and not only worked actively but also reported that the production team leader Tian Huaizeng had embezzled 220 work points, 15 yuan in cash, and stolen 200 jin of wheat from the cooperative. Because he had made a good change and worked actively, he was later elected as a branch committee member.
    Although some problems were solved at the forum, ideological problems or practical difficulties could not be completely solved in one meeting, especially for individual Party members who had opinions on the leadership and ideological disagreements, the knots in their hearts could not be untied in a short time. Therefore, after research by the branch committee, it was decided to adopt the method of whoever lives in that village helps the Party members in that village, and individual heart-to-heart talks were conducted. For example, branch committee member Zhang Huaixi lived in Guanzhuang, and he was responsible for helping the Party members in that village. After returning to the village, he patiently helped those Party members who were not active in their work, talking to them two or three times separately. After he eliminated their opinions through such individual "heart-to-heart talks," the Party members in Guanzhuang have all become active. Those who did not attend the township's Party congress in the past now attend; in production, these Party members can also "set an example" and play a leading role. Party member Cui Zengyi actively took the lead in selling excessive grain during the grain unified purchase, and later, when he requested a grain supply, he was not only not supplied but also criticized by the cadres. Since then, he has become passive in his work and unwilling to attend Party meetings. After the branch secretary talked to him and made a review, he said with satisfaction: "As long as the leaders know that I was not resisting at that time, I will feel clear in my heart, and I guarantee that I will work as actively as before in the future." He not only attends Party meetings now but also takes the initiative to lead the cooperative members to the fields for production.
    For Party members with ideological problems, the problems were solved through education and heart-to-heart talks. But what about Party members who have practical difficulties in their work and life? After research, specific help was given to Party members who were old and frail and women Party members with many children, and they were assigned work that they could do. Party member Qiao Lide, 59 years old, could not do heavy work due to back pain, so he was assigned to work as an assistant feeder. Female Party member Feng Xiuying could not leave her children, and she also had a bad relationship with her mother-in-law, so she could not work in the fields or participate in Party work. The branch sent female Party member Ma Zhenkun to persuade her mother-in-law to reconcile with her and take care of the children. In this way, Feng Xiuying could participate in production and also work. For Li Guangliang, whose family life was difficult, it was suggested that the cooperative prepay him 100 jin of food rations. Party member Zhao Yongli also had back pain and could not work in the fields. In the past, the cooperative did not take care of his difficulties, and he could only earn three work points per day. This time, based on his skills in grinding sesame oil, he was assigned to participate in the sideline group. Now he can earn nine work points per day. After this arrangement, the Party members responded very well. Zhao Yongli said: "The leaders are taking care of me like this, I guarantee to work actively and motivate others."
    In order to maintain the enthusiasm of the Party members, after research and suggestions by the branch committee and approval by the branch Party congress, meeting systems such as the branch committee, Party congress, and Party group meetings were established and improved, in order to continuously carry out criticism and self-criticism and strengthen the Party organization's supervision and education of Party members. At the same time, the branch appointed special personnel to be responsible for giving supplementary lessons to Party members who were old, sick, or had many children and had practical difficulties in attending meetings. For example, Party member Cui Huixiang's economic status rose after the land reform. During the agricultural collectivization movement, he was initially unwilling to join the cooperative and said: "I will not join the cooperative until I build a tiled house." Later, although he joined the cooperative, he was still not active in Party work. This time, the Party group meeting carried out criticism of him. He realized his mistakes, made a review, and had a significant change.
    After the Party branch did these tasks, twenty-three of the original twenty-five Party members in Zhuangli Township whose work enthusiasm was not high have had significant changes. After female Party member Feng Xiuying had her mother-in-law take care of her children, she worked actively, leading women to the fields every day and organizing five women to accumulate more than 20 carts of fertilizer. Because she can play a exemplary role among women, she has been elected as the production team leader. Now, fourteen Party members have been elected as production team leaders, branch committee members, and other leading positions, becoming the leading backbone of the branch and the cooperative.

    让所有的党员都积极起来
    刘青云
    山东齐东县寨子区状李乡已实现了全社会主义的农业合作化。全乡一百零四名党员都参加了农业合作社，其中大部分党员工作积极，在社内担任了社长、委员和队长等领导职务。但是还有二十五名党员工作不积极。为什么呢？原来这些党员中，有的是因为年老体衰，不能干重活；有的是妇女，她们因为孩子多分不开身；有的因为家庭生活困难，政治情绪不高；有的因为过去犯过错误受过处分，加上长期无人过问，因之对党不满；有的在粮食统购运动中积极带头卖了过头粮，后来，干部不但不给解决粮食供应问题，反而给予批评，因而挫伤了积极性；也有个别党员因功臣自居骄傲自满或经济地位上升，滋长了资本主义思想。这些党员的积极性如果调动不起来，对于增加合作社生产、增加社员收入都是不利的。
    但是，过去这个乡的党支部领导上对这一点认识是很差的，不但没有想法把这些党员的积极性调动起来，反而想把他们一脚踢出去。乡支部书记翟德荣同志就曾说：“留着这些党员起不了作用，快开除他们出去吧。”乡支部委员张怀西同志也说：“俺庄有七、八名落后党员，简直没法治，赶快弄出去轻快轻快吧。”今年七月七日大众日报发表了“帮助落后的党员积极起来”的社论后，开始引起了该乡支部的注意，认真地进行了学习，对“落后”党员一个一个地进行了研究。原来这二十五名党员中有二十名是在1946年以前入党的，并有十四名曾任过村长、农会会长、民兵队长等职务。他们过去工作不但积极，而且对党有一定贡献。为什么现在工作又消极了呢？支委们一致认为主要是支部工作上存在着不少的缺点，对他们教育帮助和关心不够。过去支部不分析他们工作消极的原因，不检查领导责任，对他们批评过多，要求过高。例如党员李光亮，家中只有他和八十多岁的母亲，除下地劳动外，还要烧火做饭，推磨推碾、照顾母亲。由于家务忙，不仅有时不能参加党的会议，而且劳动了一冬一春打的粮食还不够吃。支部不但没有帮助他克服这些实际困难，反而认为他思想落后，批评他工作不积极。乡支部书记翟德荣检讨说：“咱半年没对党员进行一次党的教育了，光要党员完成任务，有实际困难不帮助他们克服，他们怎么会积极工作呢？”乡支委乔玉峰说：“我们支部去年一年只开了一次支部会，还顶了牛，党内展不开批评，党员有缺点也不能及时纠正”。乡支委秦元祥说：对年纪大的党员也不能一脚踢出去。人家李光义在解放战争中，带领大车队支援前线，不怕艰苦，工作非常积极，现在他老了，工作不如从前积极，支部除了对他进行教育外，还应当按照他的具体情况来分配给他工作。
    支委会统一了认识以后，就召集那些不积极工作的党员开了一个座谈会，会上乡支部书记翟德荣代表支委会肯定了他们过去的成绩，针对他们的思想情况进行了教育。对过去支委会对他们的教育关心不够和某些问题处理不当作了检讨。这样到会的二十一名党员中，有八名不但对支委会提出了一些意见，而且作了自我检讨，表明了自己的态度，党员田怀运是转业军人，转业回家后，有功臣自居思想，不积极工作。参加座谈会后，认识了自己的缺点，不仅工作积极了，而且检举了生产队长田怀增贪污工分二百二十个、现金十五元，偷盗合作社小麦二百斤的行为。由于他转变得很好，工作积极，后来被选为支部委员。
    座谈会上虽然解决了一些问题，但是思想问题或者是实际困难问题也不是一次会议能够完全解决的，特别是个别对领导上有意见、思想上有隔阂的党员，心里的疙瘩更不是一时能够解得开的。因此，经过支委会研究，决定采取谁住那村谁帮助那村党员的办法，进行了个别谈心。如支委张怀西住官庄，他负责帮助该村党员。回村以后他就对那些工作不积极的党员进行了耐心的帮助，分别谈了两三次话。经过他这样个别“谈心”，消除意见以后，官庄的党员已经全部积极起来了，以前不参加乡的党员大会的，现在参加了；在生产上这些党员也能做到“以身作则”和起带头作用了。党员崔增一在粮食统购时，由于积极带头卖了过头粮，以后要求供应粮食时，不但没有得到供应，反而受到干部的批评。从此，他工作就消极起来，党的会议也不愿参加了。经过支部书记同他谈话，并作了检讨以后，他满意地说：“只要领导上知道那时我不是对抗，我心里就亮堂，我今后保证和以前一样积极工作。”他现在不仅参加党的会议，而且主动带领社员下地生产。
    对于有思想问题的党员，通过教育和谈心，问题总算解决了。但对于工作上和生活上有实际困难的党员怎么办呢？经过研究，对年老体衰的党员和孩子多的妇女党员进行了具体帮助，分配了力所能及的工作。党员乔立德，五十九岁，因腰痛不能干重活，就安置他作辅助饲养员工作。妇女党员冯秀英，孩子小离不开身，又与婆母不睦，不能下地劳动，也不能参加党的工作。支部派妇女党员马振坤动员她婆母与她和好起来，给她看小孩。这样冯秀英也能参加生产也能工作了。对家庭生活困难的李光亮，建议合作社预支给他口粮一百斤。党员赵永礼也有腰痛病，不能下地劳动，过去合作社没有照顾他的困难，每天只能挣三个工分，这次根据他有磨香油的技术，分配他参加了副业组。现在一天能挣九个工分。这样安排以后，党员反映很好，赵永礼说：“领导上这样照顾我，我保证积极工作，带动别人。”
    为了使党员的积极性坚持下去，经过支委会研究、提议和支部党员大会通过，建立和健全了支部委员会、党员大会、党的小组会等会议制度，以便不断地开展批评和自我批评，加强党组织对党员的监督和教育。同时对年老多病和妇女孩子多、出外参加会议有实际困难的党员，支部确定专人负责给他们补课。如党员崔会祥，土地改革以后经济地位上升，农业合作化运动中，起初不愿入社，并说：“不盖起瓦房来不入社。”后来虽然入社了，但仍然不积极作党的工作。这次党的小组会对他开展了批评，他认识了错误，作了检讨，有了显著转变。
    经过党支部做了这些工作以后，原来状李乡二十五名工作积极性不高的党员，有二十三名已有显著转变。妇女党员冯秀英有她婆母看小孩以后，工作积极了，每天带领妇女下地，并组织了五名妇女积肥二十多车。由于她能在妇女中起模范作用，已被选为生产小组长。现在有十四名党员被选为生产队长、支部委员等领导职务，成了支部和合作社的领导骨干。
