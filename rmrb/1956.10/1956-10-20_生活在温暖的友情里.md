Living in the Warmth of Friendship
　　Zhang Jie

　　As a journalist, I lived in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for two years. During these two years, many tremendous changes took place in this beautiful country, which deeply moved me. However, as a Chinese guest, what I feel most deeply and am most willing to tell people about first is "friendship," the warm internationalist friendship. For two years, I did not feel that I was working abroad, but rather that I was among the closest and most familiar friends.

　　President Ho Chi Minh once said, "We are not only close neighbors, but also brothers in adversity." This sentence provides a precise and accurate annotation for the friendship between China and Vietnam.

　　Looking at the map, from Dongxing in Guangxi to the south of Yunnan, our connecting border line is more than a thousand li, right? But what connects us is not only this long border line, nor only the Hanoi-Munank关 railway and the recently opened Hanoi-Laocai railway. The connection of our hearts is much more than all this. For centuries, the cultures of our two countries have been closely linked, and our economic lives have influenced and helped each other. This can be clearly seen in almost everything.

　　Many Vietnamese friends told me that the famous novel "The Tale of Kieu" by Vietnam's greatest poet Nguyen Du has a profound influence among the people, and "Kieu singing" is still the most popular cultural program. On moonlit nights, people often sail in small boats on the vast, misty river to sing lines from "The Tale of Kieu," and many can even recite the entire story. The basic plot of this story is taken from Yu Huai's novel "Biography of Wang Cuiqiao" from the late Ming Dynasty in China, but the poet has infinitely enriched the original simple plot, especially by describing the lives of the Vietnamese people at that time and absorbing folk language, making this work a peak in the literary career of the Vietnamese people.

　　When talking about the Vietnamese people's understanding of Chinese literature, people most easily think of President Ho Chi Minh. Some of the poems he wrote in the form of classical Chinese poetry are extremely accomplished. Like his "Boating on Yuanxiao":

　　　　The Lantern Festival moon is full tonight,
　　　　Spring river and spring water meet the spring sky.
　　　　Discussing military affairs in the depths of misty waves,
　　　　Returning at midnight, the boat is full of moonlight.

　　And the poem written during the Cao Bang campaign:

　　　　Carrying a staff, climbing the mountain to view the battlements,
　　　　Ten thousand mountains embrace ten thousand clouds.
　　　　The righteous soldiers' spirit swallows the Dipper,
　　　　Vowing to exterminate the jackal invaders.

　　The former is so fresh and reminds people of Li Bai's lines "Clear water produces lotuses, naturally free from artifice," and the latter is so heroic. Such skilled brushwork and poems that are not bound by the form of old poetry are also rare in our country, aren't they? In addition to President Ho Chi Minh, Bui Bang Doan, the former Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Vietnamese National Assembly who passed away last year, and Bui Ky, the President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, were both known for their ability to write poetry. The poems exchanged between Ho Chi Minh and Bui Bang Doan are still praised by many people today. At a banquet, a Vietnamese comrade—a poet from the South—dipped his chopsticks in wine and wrote two lines of poetry, saying: "Chinese poets have the lines 'Meeting on horseback without paper and brush, please send a message to report peace.' Today, I will use 'Meeting before the banquet without paper and brush, please send a message to report friendship' to express my feelings!"

　　I would like to describe an extremely strong impression, which was during a conversation with a financial cadre when I was a guest in Yi'an City, the capital of the Fourth Inter-zone of Central Vietnam, last October. He talked about the customs of Ha Tinh, Nghe An and other places, and then told me: "It's much hotter here than in northern Vietnam. In China, the Double Ninth Festival is already the time when chrysanthemums are in full bloom, and there are lines of poetry like 'Why are chrysanthemums so bitter, suffering two Double Ninth Festivals,' but here, chrysanthemums don't bloom until long after the Double Ninth Festival."

　　The above are just a few examples. Many comrades say that in Vietnam, Chinese comrades often feel embarrassed, because Vietnamese comrades often know more about us than we know about ourselves. People often encounter questions like: Is Dong Yong in "The Fairy Couple" the same Dong Yong in "The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars"? In what dynasty did the story of "Refining the Seal" take place? All of this shows the close cultural relationship between our two countries for a long time.

　　I have visited many places in Vietnam, and even in the most remote places, the Vietnamese people always love to hang the Five-Star Red Flag, the Soviet flag, and the Golden Star Red Flag together to express their solid friendship. In an area of Ha Dong province, in order to explore the secrets in people's hearts, I walked towards a newly built house. This was a house covered with nipa palm leaves, and the freshly painted walls still exuded the earthy smell of the fields. Inside, on a delicate, painted table carved with flying birds and dragons (obviously a victory fruit of the land reform), were portraits of President Ho Chi Minh, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Chairman Bulganin.

　　Welcoming me was an old woman. When she learned that I was a Chinese guest, she seemed a little excited. She told me that she was living a good life now. Finally, she said with a bit of an elderly tone: "Be sure to tell the Chinese people that our hearts are together."

　　This old woman was not the first to ask me to convey these exciting words of friendship. How many kind faces floated before my eyes, including farmers, workers, and elementary school students wearing red scarves. I remember that in a "resistance factory" that had just moved back to the plain area, the workers wanted me to tell the Chinese worker brothers about their production achievements; and on October 31 last year, the track-laying project of the Hanoi-Nam Dinh railway was completed. A young Vietnamese technician pulled me, and we walked along the railway track that had not yet been completely laid with gravel, talking in Vietnamese and Chinese. He repeatedly urged me: "Tell the worker brothers of Chongqing 101 Steel Plant that we have used the steel rails they rushed to make for the Vietnamese people to lay the railway to Nam Dinh City, the third largest city in North Vietnam!"

　　Chinese industrial products are particularly popular in Vietnam. In an auto repair shop, I saw Chinese characters such as "How are you? I am working" on the blackboard. It turned out that many workers were learning Chinese in their spare time. Here, there are drilling machines, lathes, and shapers produced by Chinese machine tool factories, and the workers protect these machines as if they were dressing up a bride. In the Hai Phong Cement Plant, a technician boasted to me about the Chinese-made experimental instruments, while middle school students in Hanoi were preparing to write letters to the Chinese people to congratulate them on seeing the Chinese-made microscopes... Is the meaning only in the exquisite nature of these industrial products? No, what is more important is the hearts of loved ones. Even a little progress will make the Vietnamese people happy and proud of their brothers' victory!

　　A new feature of the friendship between our two peoples is that there are more and more exchanges between us. In the past year and this year alone, the two sides have sent many delegations to visit each other. Almost every Vietnamese comrade will tell you that one of his most pressing wishes is to visit China, the Soviet Union, and other countries.

　　In Vietnam, Chinese books are among the most popular books. Many of Comrade Mao Zedong's works have been translated into Vietnamese and published, including "On Contradiction," which was personally translated by President Ho Chi Minh. Soon after the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's book "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," it was translated into Vietnamese and widely welcomed. Chinese literary works such as Zhao Shuli and Wei Wei's works have aroused the interest of many Vietnamese comrades. In the 1954 and 1955 literary awards held this year, "Soldier and Motherland" and "A True Warrior - Dong Cunrui," translated from Chinese, won the translation awards. At the same time, Vietnamese comrades will tell you that a new anthology of Chinese literature (including a selection of short stories and poems) is being compiled, which will introduce more Chinese literary works to the Vietnamese people.

　　Vietnamese writers and poets have also created many works about Vietnamese-Chinese friendship. After visiting China, Nguyen Tuan, a famous Vietnamese writer and Secretary-General of the Vietnam Arts Association, published his diary in China, which is a book full of friendship. Another Vietnamese poet, Hoang Trung Thong, dedicated his long poem of more than four hundred lines to the Chinese people. The title of this poem is: "Salute to China." The Vietnamese art community also gave extremely high evaluations to the paintings of Qi Baishi, Xu Beihong, and others. They said that Vietnamese and Chinese paintings also have similarities in style... The meeting between Chairman Mao Zedong and President Ho Chi Minh has become the subject of many art workers, who recorded this solemn historical moment with paintings and sculptures.

　　The above is only a part of what I can record in my feelings in Vietnam. Of course, it is far from all of my feelings, let alone the friendship between our two countries.

　　When I relive these feelings, I feel excited—when I see the Vietnamese people looking at Chinese pictures with fascination, when I see Vietnamese farmers laying out the words "Long Live Vietnamese-Chinese-Soviet Friendship" with flowers, this feeling has shaken me more than once. Therefore, I would like to express my gratitude to the Vietnamese friends who have sincerely cared for and helped me, and say loudly: Our friendship will be further developed and consolidated.

    生活在温暖的友情里
    张结
    作为一个新闻工作者，我曾经在越南民主共和国生活了两年。两年来，这个美丽的国家发生了许多巨大的变化，使我深深地受到感动。然而，作为一个中国客人，我感触最深的、也最首先愿意告诉人们的是“友情”、温暖的国际主义的友情。两年以来，我不觉得我是在国外工作着，而是觉得在最亲近最熟悉的朋友中间。
    胡志明主席曾经说过，“我们不仅是紧密的邻邦，也是患难的兄弟”。这句话为中越两国的友情作了精辟、确切的注解。
    从地图上看，从广西的东兴到云南的南部，我们衔接的国境线总有一千多里吧？但连接着我们的却并不只是这漫长的国境线，也不只是河内—睦南关铁路和最近通车的河内—老街铁路，我们的心的连结比这一切要多得多。在多少世纪以来，我们两个国家的文化便紧密地联系着，经济生活上互相影响和帮助着，这一点，几乎在每一件事情上都可以明显地看出来。
    很多越南朋友告诉我，越南最伟大的诗人阮攸的名著“翠翘传”在人民中间有着深切的影响，“唱翘”目前依然是人民最喜爱的文艺节目。在月白风清之夜，人们常常驾着小舟，在烟波浩荡的江面上唱着“翠翘传”上的诗句，有很多人甚至可以全部背诵。这个故事的基本情节，是取自我国明末人余怀的小说“王翠翘传”，不过诗人把原来极简单的情节无限地丰富了，特别是诗人描述了当时越南人民的生活和吸收了民间的语言，使这个作品成为越南人民文学事业中的一个高峰。
    在谈到越南人民对中国文学的了解，人们最容易想起胡志明主席，他用中国旧诗形式所写的一些诗，造诣是极高的。像他的“元宵泛舟”：
    今夜元宵月正圆　　春江春水接春天
    烟波深处谈军事　　夜半归来月满船和写于高平战役时的诗：
    携杖登山观阵地　万重山拥万重云
    义兵壮气吞牛斗　誓灭豺狼侵略军
    前者那末清新，令人想起李白的诗句“清水出芙蓉，天然去雕饰”，后者又那末豪迈。这样熟练的笔法和不为旧诗的形式所束缚的诗句，求之我国，不也是不多的吗？除了胡志明主席，在去年病逝的前越南国民大会常务委员会委员长裴朋团、越中友好协会会长裴纪都以能诗名，胡志明主席和裴朋团的唱和诗，今天还为很多人所赞赏。在一次宴会上，一个越南同志——他是来自南部的诗人——用筷子沾着酒写下两句诗，并且说：“中国诗人有着‘马上相逢无纸笔，凭君寄语报平安’的诗句，今天我就以‘宴前相逢无纸笔，凭君寄语报友情’来表示我的心情吧！”
    我想叙述一次极为强烈的印象，那是去年10月间，当我在中越第四联区的首府——宜安市作客的时候，和一个财经干部的谈话。他谈到了河静、义安等地的风土人情，接着就告诉我：“这里比越北要热得多，在中国，重阳节已经是菊花盛开的时候了，有过“菊花何太苦，遭此两重阳”的诗句，但这里，菊花却要重阳以后很久才开。”
    以上不过是几个例子罢了。许多同志说，在越南，中国同志常常会感到脸红的，因为越南同志对我们的了解往往比我们自己知道的还多。人们常常遇到这样的问题：“天仙配”中的董永是不是“二十四孝”中的董永呢？“炼印”的故事发生在什么朝代？这一切，都可以看出我们两国很久以来在文化上的密切关系。
    我曾经在越南的很多地方访问，即使在最偏僻的地方，越南人民也总爱把五星红旗、苏联旗和金星红旗挂在一起，表示它们之间牢固的友谊。在河东省的一个地区，为了想探索一下人们心里的秘密，我朝着一个新盖起的房舍走去。这是一个复盖着葵树叶的房子，刚刷好的墙壁还散发着田野里泥土的气息，在室内精致的、雕有飞鸟和龙的油漆桌子上面（它显然是土改中的胜利果实），是胡志明主席和毛泽东主席、布尔加宁主席的画像。
    迎接我的是一个年老的大娘，当她知道我是一个中国客人时，她显得有点激动了。她告诉我，目前她生活得很好，最后，她带点老年人的口吻说：“一定要告诉中国人民，我们的心是在一起的。”
    要求我传达这令人激动的友谊的话语，这个老大娘已经不是第一个了，有多少亲切的面孔在我眼前浮起，这中间有农民、工人，还有带着红领巾的小学生。我记起在一个刚刚迁回平原地区的“抗战工厂”里，工人们要我把他们的生产成绩告诉中国的工人兄弟；而在去年10月31号，河内—南定铁路的铺轨工程完成了，一个年青的越南技术人员拉着我，我们沿着还没有完全铺上石子的铁轨走着，一边用越南话和中国话交谈。他再三叮嘱我：“要告诉重庆一○一钢铁厂的工人兄弟们，使用他们为越南人民赶制的钢轨，我们已经把铁路铺到北越的第三大城市——南定市了！”
    中国的工业产品在越南特别受到欢迎。在一个汽车修理厂里，我在黑板上看到“你好吗？我在工作”等中国字，原来许多工人在业余时间学习中文。这里，有着中国机床厂生产的钻床、旋床、牛头刨床等，工人们像打扮新娘似的保护着这些机器；在海防水泥厂，一个技术人员向我夸耀中国制造的实验仪器，而河内市的中学生们则由于看到中国制造的显微镜而准备写信向中国人民祝贺……难道意义仅仅在于这些工业产品的精美吗？不，更重要的是亲人的心，即使是一点点的进步，越南人民也会为他们的兄弟的胜利而欣喜和骄傲啊！
    作为我们两国人民友谊的新的特征是：我们之间的来往愈来愈多了，仅仅在去年和今年里面，双方便互派了许多代表团进行访问。几乎每一个越南同志都会告诉你：他最迫切的愿望之一便是到中国、苏联等国访问。
    在越南，中国的书籍是最受欢迎的书籍中的一部分，毛泽东同志的很多著作已经被翻译成越文出版，其中有胡志明主席亲自翻译的“矛盾论”等。毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”一书出版后不久，就已经被翻译成越文，受到广泛的欢迎。中国的文艺作品如赵树理、魏巍等人的著作都引起不少越南同志的兴趣，在今年举行的1954、1955年度文艺评奖中，由中文翻译的“战士与祖国”、“真正的战士——董存瑞”等都获得了翻译作品奖，同时越南同志会告诉你，一部新的中国文学选集（它包括短篇小说选和诗歌选）正在编纂中，它将更多地把中国的文学作品介绍给越南人民。
    越南的作家、诗人关于越中友谊的创作也是非常多的。在访问了中国之后，越南的著名作家、越南文艺会总书记阮遵出版了他的在中国的日记，这是一本充满友情的书。另一个越南诗人黄忠通把他的四百多行的长诗作献给中国人民，这首诗的题目是：“向中国致敬”。越南的美术界对齐白石、徐悲鸿等人的绘画也都给予极高的评价，他们说，越南绘画和中国绘画在风格上也是有着相同之处的……毛泽东主席和胡志明主席的会见成为不少美术工作者的题材，他们用绘画、用雕刻记下了这庄严的历史的时刻。
    以上是我在越南的感受中所能记录下来的一部分，当然，它远非我的感受的全部，更不要说我们两个国家间的友情了。
    当我重温这些感受时，我觉得激动——当我见到越南人民出神地看着中国图片的时候，当我看到越南农民用鲜花铺成“越中苏友好万岁”字样的时候，这种感情都不只一次地震撼着我。因此，我愿意对曾经诚挚地关怀、帮助过我的越南友人表示感谢，并且大声地说：我们的友谊将更加发展和巩固。
