Is it Negligence, or Working Independently?
　　
　　Stepping out of Fuchengmen in Beijing, one can see rows of newly built red buildings, in front of which stand concrete poles for trolleybuses. Not long ago, these poles were supported by four wooden poles, like a patient with crutches, but now they have been removed, looking brand new.

　　Why did the new poles need crutches? There is a story of subjectivism and bureaucracy behind this.

　　Li Shunan, a technician from the Third Work Zone of the Second Engineering Company of the Water and Sewerage Engineering Bureau, was the first to discover that someone was installing concrete trolleybus poles on the sewer lines on the south side of Fuwai Street. At the time, he found it strange: why install concrete poles weighing more than a ton on top of the sewer lines? If the poles were removed when the sewer was excavated in the future, it would definitely cause waste to the state; if they were not removed, it would affect the safety of the sewer workers. Li Shunan was very anxious and quickly ran to the work zone, requesting that the pole installation project be stopped, but this request was not accepted. Li Shunan hurried to the Public Utilities Bureau. After some negotiation, the Public Utilities Bureau used the telephone to notify the trolleybus company's work zone to suspend the pole installation and asked the trolleybus company's work zone to contact the Third Work Zone of the Water and Sewerage Engineering Bureau to resolve the issue. However, when Li Shunan returned to the construction site, the third pole had already been erected. Work was still continuing at the site.

　　As days went by, the poles were erected one after another. So, he discussed the matter with Chief Engineer Dai Runchang. Dai Runchang, who was an impatient person, thought the situation was serious after learning about it. He called the Public Utilities Bureau again, but couldn't find anyone in charge. Dai Runchang then transferred the call to the director's office. The person who answered the phone interrupted him before he could finish speaking and told him to talk to the relevant department.

　　Dai Runchang earnestly begged him to report the situation to the director, hoping that the poles could be installed after the sewer project was completed, since the trolleybuses could not be used anyway.

　　The person who answered the phone in the director's office said, "When it will be open to traffic and whether it will be used is confidential and cannot be discussed over the phone."

　　Dai Runchang insisted on asking the director to solve the problem, but the person answering the phone simply shut him out: "Then please have your Water and Sewerage Engineering Bureau negotiate with an official letter!"

　　In fact, the Public Utilities Bureau and the Water and Sewerage Engineering Bureau were in the same alley – Xisi Yangrou Hutong, less than a hundred meters apart, and both were municipal engineering units with a history of cooperation. It was really inappropriate to resort to paperwork for such an urgent problem.

　　In this situation, Dai Runchang and Li Shunan had no choice but to go to the Supervision Bureau to report the issue. Director Wang of the Supervision Bureau went to the site in person to take a look and then immediately reported to Deputy Mayor Xue. When Deputy Mayor Xue's office notified the Public Utilities Bureau to stop the pole installation project, sixteen concrete utility poles had already been planted.

　　Before the work was stopped, the heads of the work zones on both sides negotiated a solution. The trolleybus company's work zone would bear the cost of supporting the concrete poles with four wooden poles to ensure safety.

　　Why did this happen? Was it negligence, or working independently? As early as March of this year, the Municipal Engineering Design Institute had made the technical design for the rainwater pipes. In theory, the Design Institute should have had a comprehensive plan for the Public Utilities Bureau's trial erection of trolleybus poles. Unfortunately, according to the person in charge of the trolleybus design team, they had reported the trial erection plan for the trolleybus lines to the Design Institute, and had held several meetings, and had also contacted the maintenance and management department of the Water and Sewerage Engineering Bureau, but they had never known that the sewer on Fuwai Street would start construction in August, so they subjectively believed that "there was no need to cooperate with any unit" to carry out the construction. After the problem was raised, the leaders of the Public Utilities Bureau did not solve the problem in a timely manner, and in the process of negotiation, some staff members showed a bureaucratic style of irresponsibility to the state, causing unnecessary confusion in the work of the work zones.

　　At present, the chaotic phenomenon in municipal engineering, as pointed out by Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in his speech at the Eighth National Congress of the Party, "is quite serious." In the future, we should strengthen the unified leadership of the municipal construction departments, so that they can cooperate closely with each other and overcome the phenomenon of working independently and shifting responsibility to each other.

    是疏忽，还是各自为政
    刘时平　施毓忠
    走出北京阜成门，一眼望出去，那一座挨一座新建的红色楼房前，竖立着一根根无轨电车混凝土电杆。不久以前，这些电杆还用四根木杆支撑着，像病人拄着拐棍一样，现在已经拆除得面目一新了。
    为什么新的电杆要拄着拐棍呢？这里面有着主观主义和官僚主义的故事。
    上下水道工程局第二工程公司第三工区的技术员李树楠第一个发现在阜外大街南便道上有人把无轨电车混凝土电杆安装在下水道的线路上，当时他很奇怪：为什么把一吨多重的混凝土电杆栽到下水道的线路上了呢？将来下水道开工刨槽的时候，如果拔掉电杆吧，一定要给国家造成浪费，不拔吧，又会影响下水道工人作业的安全。李树楠很着急，就赶快跑到工区，要求对方能把安装电杆的工程停下来，但是这个要求没有被接受。李树楠连忙跑到公用局，经过一番协商，由公用局用电话通知电车公司工区暂停栽杆，并叫电车公司工区和水道第三工区联系解决。可是李树楠返回工地的时候，电杆子已经架好第三根了。工地上依然在继续工作。
    时间一天天过去，电杆子也一根紧接着一根栽起来了，于是他又和主任工程师戴润昌商议。戴润昌是一个性急的人，知道了这个情况后，认为很严重，又给公用局去电话，结果找谁谁不在，戴润昌又把电话转到局长办公室，接电话的人没等他说完，就打断了他的话，让他找主管科去谈。
    戴润昌诚恳地央求他向局长反映一下情况，希望等到下水道工程完工后再栽电杆，因为无轨电车反正现在不能通车。
    局长办公室接电话的人却说：“什么时候通车，使用不使用，事关保密，在电话里不能谈。”
    戴润昌坚持要请局长解决，接电话的人干脆给他吃了一个闭门羹：“那就请你们上下水道工程局用公函来交涉吧！”
    其实，公用局和上下水道工程局就在一个胡同——西四羊肉胡同，相隔不到一百公尺之远，又都是市政工程单位，一向有往来，像这样急待解决的问题，还要玩弄文牍，实在不应该。
    在这种情况下，戴润昌和李树楠不得已就决定到监察局去揭发。监察局的王局长亲自到现场去看了一次，然后立即报请薛副市长。当薛副市长办公室通知公用局停止栽杆工程的时候，混凝土电线杆已经栽下十六根了。
    停工前，双方工区的负责人协商好善后办法，由电车公司工区负担费用，在混凝土电杆上用四根木杆来支住电杆，保证安全。
    为什么会造成这种现象呢？是疏忽，还是各自为政呢？早在今年3月间市政工程设计院就已作出雨水管技术设计。按理，设计院对于公用局试架无轨电车电杆应该有通盘计划。遗憾的是据无轨电车设计组的负责人说：他们在定线路时，曾经向设计院报告过无轨电车线路试架设方案，也开过几次会，并和上下水道工程局养护管理处也联系过，但是他们一直不知道阜外大街的下水道要在8月间开工，因此就主观地认为“无须与任何单位配合”进行施工。当问题提出来以后，公用局的领导上没有及时解决这个问题，并在交涉的过程中，有的工作人员表现了对国家不负责任的官僚主义作风，使工区的工作发生了不应有的混乱。
    目前，市政工程中的混乱现象，正如中共北京市委会第二书记刘仁在党的第八次全国代表大会发言中所指出的“是相当严重的”。今后应当加强市政建设部门的统一领导，使它们之间密切配合，克服各自为政、互相扯皮的现象。
