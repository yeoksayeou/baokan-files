Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 22nd. Tianjin, an important port for China's trade with Japan, saw the value of goods imported to and exported from Japan in the first three quarters of this year exceed the total value of Tianjin Port's trade with Japan in 1936, before the War of Resistance Against Japan, by 50%.

Since the beginning of this year, about one Japanese merchant ship has arrived at Tianjin Port every two days. These ships have brought more than 600 kinds of commodities to China, including fertilizer, kelp, rayon, medicines, dyes, textiles, hardware tools, and machinery parts. They have transported large quantities of edible salt, beans, cashmere, minerals, animal products, and local specialties from China.

People in Tianjin's international trade circles believe that the economies of China and Japan and the people's habits of using goods have historical connections. For example, the Japanese chemical industry and others have used Changlu salt from China for many years. The supply has gradually increased in recent years. From January to September this year, it has more than doubled compared with 1953. This year, more than 850 tons of licorice needed for Japanese-made Jintan and other products have been supplied. More than 1,600 writing brushes used by Japanese people for writing couplets and hanging screens will also be shipped recently. In addition, Chinese specialties needed by Japan, such as porcelain clay, asbestos, and flint, are being supplied as much as possible. Similarly, China also needs some Japanese industrial products.

    天津港对日贸易超过战前水平
    新华社天津22日电　中国对日贸易的重要港口天津，今年前三个季度向日本进出口的商品价值，已经超过抗日战争以前1936年天津港对日贸易总值50％。
    今年以来，大约每两天就有一艘日本商船来到天津港。这些商船给中国带来了肥田粉、海带、人造丝、药品、染料、纺织品、五金工具和机械零件等六百多种商品，从中国运回去大量的食盐、豆类、羊绒和矿产品、畜产品、土特产品。
    天津市国际贸易界人士认为，中日两国的经济和人民使用商品的习惯有着历史的联系。如日本化学工业等使用了很多年的中国长芦盐，这几年的供应量逐渐增多，今年1月到9月份已比1953年增加了一倍以上；日本制仁丹等需用的甘草，今年已经供应八百五十多吨；日本人写对联、挂屏要用的毛笔，最近也将运去一千六百多支；还有瓷土、石棉、燧石等日本需要的中国特产品，都在尽可能地供应。同样，中国也需要一些日本的工业品。
