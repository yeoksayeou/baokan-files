　　Curbing Unreasonable Transportation
　　——Readers' Opinions on Solving Transportation Congestion
　　Transportation congestion occurs in many places. This is certainly due to the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, which has not been matched by corresponding transportation tools. However, on the other hand, a large amount of unreasonable transportation has also aggravated the current transportation congestion. For example, the Beijing Granite Factory Preparatory Office is currently building houses in Zhoukoudian. All 574,000 bricks used for the entire project are transported from other places by railway. However, a handicraft production cooperative located eight kilometers from Zhoukoudian produces bricks, which are then transported outwards in large quantities by railway because there is no local market for them. The handling capacity of Zhoukoudian Station is not large, and the platform is often piled with goods that cannot be transported in time. This kind of unreasonable cross-transportation also squeezes in to occupy transportation tools. What a heartbreaking waste! I believe that stopping unreasonable cross-transportation should be included in the measures to solve the current transportation congestion problem and should attract the attention of all parties.

　　After the Qian-Gui Railway opened to Mowei, a large number of materials destined for the Southwest were unloaded at the Mowei freight yard. The goods currently stockpiled at the Mowei freight yard are considerable, and the highway transportation department cannot transfer these goods to various parts of the Southwest in a timely manner, which has a certain impact on industrial and agricultural production, capital construction, and people's lives in the Southwest.

　　However, are all these materials necessary to be transported from other places to the Southwest? Our view is: not all of them are needed. For example, among the materials currently stockpiled for shipment are powder skin, brown sugar, tobacco leaves, bamboo mosquito net rings, lampshades, pillows and many other kinds. Except for brown sugar, which we don't know much about, we believe that other materials can be processed and supplied locally by various provinces without the need for long-distance transfers from Shanghai, Guangzhou and other places. This will not only reduce the burden on transportation and ensure supply, but also benefit the support of local handicrafts, the activation of the local economy, and the improvement of the lives of local people.

　　It is hoped that the commercial departments will not only seek convenience when allocating goods, regardless of whether it is reasonable or not. It is hoped that the handicraft management departments will actively operate, strive to obtain materials locally, process them locally, and sell them locally. It is hoped that the financial and economic leadership departments of various provinces will strengthen the review of procurement plans and the leadership of handicraft production, avoid the phenomenon of reverse flow of materials as much as possible, and ensure market supply.

　　Rationalization of transportation is a policy that has been put forward long ago, but unreasonable transportation such as excessively long distances, duplication, cross-transportation, and short distances still exists seriously. Taking the Guangzhou Transportation Sub-bureau as an example, the cross-transportation of bituminous coal between Hengyang and Pingshi in the most recent period alone wasted more than 2 million ton-kilometers of transportation capacity. Eliminating unreasonable transportation and saving transportation capacity is obviously an important measure to solve the current transportation congestion problem.

　　I am a railway transportation work cadre. The large amount of unreasonable transportation here shows that I have not fulfilled my responsibilities. However, in my work, I also deeply realize that if there is no support and cooperation from various relevant departments, such as the leading transportation departments, material distribution departments, and material-requiring departments, it is indeed difficult to eliminate unreasonable transportation. It often happens that when we are preparing the monthly transportation plan, we find unreasonable transportation, make a record, and report it to the higher authorities for processing. Who knows that after turning around, there is no follow-up; sometimes it is finally turned back, but it is "approved to supply beyond the flow direction."

　　Organizing reasonable transportation is an extremely complex and meticulous task, involving many issues such as production, consumption, transportation, and the variety, specifications, and uses of products. It requires the cooperation of all parties, and even more so, everyone must have a sense of responsibility to safeguard national interests. It is hoped that transportation at all levels, material distribution, and material-requiring units will pay attention to the work of rational transportation and no longer allow unreasonable transportation to waste our country's valuable transportation resources.

　　取缔不合理的运输
　　——读者对解决运输堵塞问题的意见
    许多地方都发生运输堵塞现象，这固然是由于工、农业生产迅速发展，交通运输工具没有相应地跟上所造成；但另一方面，大量不合理的运输，也加重了目前的运输堵塞现象。例如最近北京市花岗石厂筹建处在周口店建筑房屋，全部工程用砖五十七万四千块，都是通过铁路从外地运来的，可是距周口店八公里的地方，有一个手工业生产合作社生产的砖，却又因当地没有销路，通过铁路大量往外运。周口店车站的吞吐能力本来不大，站台上长期堆满着不能及时运走的货物，这类不合理的对流运输也要挤进来侵占运输工具，是一种多么令人痛心的浪费呵！我认为，应该把制止不合理的对流运输，列入解决当前运输堵塞问题的措施范围内，引起各方面的注意。

    黔桂铁路通车到麻尾后，大批运往西南的物资就卸在麻尾货场。目前积压在麻尾货场的货物极其可观，公路运输部门不能及时把这些货物转运到西南各地去，对于西南的工农业生产，基本建设和人民生活都有一定的影响。
    然而，是不是所有这些物资都是必须从外地往西南运的呢？我们的看法是：并不都是需要的。例如目前堆存待运的物资中就有粉皮、红糖、烟叶、竹制蚊帐圈、纱罩、枕头等许多种。除红糖我们不太了解外，其他物资我们认为都是可以通过各省就地加工供应，而不需要千里迢迢从上海、广州等地调拨的。这样做，不但可以减轻运输上的负担，保证供应，而且对扶助当地的手工业，活跃地方经济，改善当地人民的生活都是有好处的。
    希望商业部门在调拨商品时不要只图省事，不管合理不合理。希望手工业管理部门积极经营，力求就地取材，就地加工，就地销售。希望各省财政经济领导部门加强对采购计划的审核和对手工业生产的领导，尽可能地避免物资倒流现象，并且保证市场供应。
                            李玉明
    运输合理化，是早就提出来的方针，但过远，重复，对流，短距离等不合理的运输，至今还严重存在。拿广州运输分局来说，仅最近一个时期衡阳至砰石间的烟煤对流运输，就浪费了运输力二百多万吨公里。取缔不合理运输，节约运力，对解决当前的运输堵塞问题，显然是一个重要措施。
    我是一个铁路运输工作干部。我们这里不合理的运输大量存在，说明我的工作还没有尽到责任。但是在工作中我也深深体会到，如果没有各个有关部门，例如交通运输的领导部门，物资分配部门，需要物资部门的支持和配合，取缔不合理运输确实是困难的。常常发生这样的事情：我们在编制月度运输计划的时候，发现了不合理运输，做了纪录，报请上级处理。谁知转来转去，最后竟不知下文了；有时好容易转回来，却是“批准超流向供应”。
    组织合理运输，是一个极其复杂、极其细致的工作，牵涉到生产、消费、运输和产品的品种、规格、用途等许多问题，需要各方面的配合协作，更需要人人都有维护国家利益的责任感。希望各级交通运输，物资分配和需要物资单位都来重视合理运输的工作，不再让不合理的运输浪费我们国家宝贵的运输力量。
