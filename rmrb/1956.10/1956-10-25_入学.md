    Yan Yan just turned seven years old in June, and today she is taking the entrance exam for the Experimental Elementary School. Her mother, Qianyi, is helping her comb her braids, while also rehearsing for the entrance exam.
      "If the teacher asks you how many people are in your family, how will you answer?"
      "Me, Grandma, Dad, Mom, three older brothers, and one older sister, a total of eight people."
      "Correct! Put yourself last, because you are the youngest. If they ask you, which city do we live in? And who else lives in this city?"
      "We live in Beijing. Chairman Mao lives in Beijing, and so do the PLA uncles and worker uncles."
    Mother and daughter continue with the questions and answers. Yan Yan is especially excited today and seems restless. She is unwilling to answer questions patiently, only hoping to go to school quickly to take the exam. Qianyi is somewhat nervous, worried that Yan Yan might panic temporarily and say something wrong or leave something out.
    The Experimental Elementary School is really clean today. Four Young Pioneers are standing at the entrance, warmly greeting the prospective students. The children are all wearing new clothes, accompanied by their grandmothers or mothers, giving earnest instructions.
    The exam went very smoothly. The teacher said Yan Yan did very well and to come to the school in half a month to see the results.
    On the way home, Yan Yan and a new friend she made during the exam were chatting congenially. Qianyi, on the other hand, was immersed in her own memories: 1941 to 1956, fifteen years of marriage. In between, she had been pregnant with eleven children. War, disease, only five of the eleven children survived. In the guerrilla areas repeatedly contested by the enemy and us, in the base areas heavily blockaded by Chiang's troops, how much hardship she had endured while pregnant and raising children! Today, she is sending the youngest to the school gate, and the eldest child was recommended to middle school by the Experimental Elementary School two years ago. In this rapidly changing era, children are growing up so fast, soon they will surpass me. What about myself? Under the impetus of the great wave of the national liberation war, I joined the revolution, but did not complete my university courses. For more than a decade, at the organization's request, I worked as a reporter, editor, did women's work, confidential work, personnel work... but without any special skill. In the future, with the extremely fine division of labor in society, what will I do? Will I be thrown off the car of the times during a sharp turn? Or will I get on the car of the times and advance to a better future?…
    The car passed through Tiananmen Square. Yan Yan and her friend clapped their little hands and sang, interrupting Qianyi's thoughts.
    At night, the weather was not hot, but it was much cooler outdoors than indoors. The children were taken to Beihai Park by their grandmother. Qianyi was waiting in the courtyard for her husband to come home for dinner.
    The stars twinkled, and the moonlight filtered through the branches of the old apricot tree, casting sparse spots on the ground. In the courtyard, cannas, dahlias, and night-blooming jasmine emitted a faint fragrance. In the next courtyard, the unfortunate blind girl was diligently practicing the piano again, one piece after another. Qianyi paced back and forth in the courtyard, waiting for her husband while thinking:
      "I must have a skill, I can't go on like this! Even A Wei, the blind girl next door, is not complacent in this great era. She hopes to become a musician, so she practices the piano diligently every night. I am still young, even if I re-enter university this year and study for four years from scratch, I will still be under forty when I graduate… I am only afraid of not learning, not afraid of learning late?…"
    The piano was playing Chopin's famous piece. Both the future blind musician and the mother with five children were immersed in beautiful imaginings.
    The cicadas chirped in bursts, and the searchlights in the sky were interwoven into silver patterns. The night, the summer night in Beijing is so moving! So tranquil!
    The Party Secretary was a kind and stern old cadre. He had participated in the Long March and gloriously lost his left arm in the national liberation war. His health was not good, but he was spirited, optimistic, and always concerned about his comrades. Anyone in the department who had good news or was upset would want to talk to him. He would patiently listen to their narratives and then reasonably solve their problems for them.
    The Party Secretary had noticed Qianyi's recent worries.
      "Why have you been talking less these days? Is it that the chronically ill fourth child is sick again?" the Party Secretary asked.
    "No! Secretary Feng, the children are all fine. It's just that I have a new idea that I'm pondering, but I can't figure it out."
      "Oh! A new idea? What is it?"
      "I left university eighteen years ago. I once hoped to become a chemist, but then I joined the revolution and abandoned my major. For more than a decade, due to family burdens, I have been content with the status quo and dared not have extravagant hopes. Now, the youngest one has also entered elementary school, and the children are growing up very quickly, but I am falling behind! I really want to go back to my alma mater to finish my beloved major; if I delay it for another three years, my age will not allow me to go to school anymore." Qianyi said slowly, but her inner excitement made her lips tremble slightly.
    "Good! This is indeed new! Worth considering. But I want to ask you, if you go to school and leave your family unattended, what will happen to the children?"
      "My mother just came to Beijing from our old home in Jiangxi. She is not yet sixty years old and is very healthy. She can help me take care of the housework."
      "Then, will your partner have any objections?"
      "No, he is not a selfish person, he understands my aspirations."
    "Alright! Let me discuss it with Elder Xue, the head of the Cadre Department, and then give you an answer."
    A week later, Qianyi received a notice from the Party committee allowing her to study. After passing the exam, she was admitted to her alma mater. The whole family was happy about this. The grandmother was especially enthusiastic. That day, the old lady did not take a nap at noon and quietly went to the department store to buy new washbasins, towels, soap dishes, rice bowls, chopsticks, pillows, and toothbrush cups... The things were much more elaborate than when Qianyi entered university in 1937. When the children saw them, they criticized their grandmother: "The old ones can still be used, Grandma is buying new ones again, it's such a waste!" The grandmother became anxious and quickly explained: "When your mother got married, I was in our old home in Jiangxi and didn't send her any dowry. Now, buying these few things is to make up for that year's dowry…"

    燕燕在六月刚满七周岁，今天她要参加实验小学的入学考试。她的妈妈倩一正在帮她梳小辫，一面还在进行入学考试的演习。
      “老师问你家里多少人，你怎样回答？”
      “我、姥姥、爸、妈、三个哥哥、一个姐姐，共有八个人。”
      “对！把自己放在最后，因为你最小。再问你，咱们住在那个城里？这城里还住着谁？”
      “咱们住在北京，北京有毛主席，还有解放军叔叔，工人叔叔。”
    妈妈和女儿在继续问答。燕燕今天特别兴奋，显得很不安静，她不肯耐心地回答问题，只希望快些到学校参加考试。倩一多少有些紧张，她耽心燕燕临时慌张，会说错了或是说漏了。
    实验小学今天收拾得真干净，门口站着四个少先队队员，热情地招呼着投考的同学。孩子们都穿着新衣服，奶奶或妈妈陪着他们，谆谆叮嘱着。
    考试进行得很顺利，老师说燕燕考得很好，隔半个月来学校看榜。
    在回家的路上，燕燕和投考时新交的小朋友投机地谈着话。倩一则沉醉在自己地回忆里：1941到1956，结婚是整整十五年了。这中间前后怀过十一个孩子，战争、疾病、十一个孩子只留下了五个。在敌我反复争夺的游击区，在蒋军重重封锁的根据地，怀孩子、带孩子曾熬过多少困苦呵！到今天把最小的一个送进学校大门，最大的孩子前年由实验小学保送进中学，在这日新月异的年代里，孩子成长得这样快，快要走到我的前面去了。自己呢？在民族解放战争的巨浪推动下参加了革命，大学的课程没有读完，十几年来在组织的需要下当过记者，编辑，做过妇女工作、机要工作、人事工作……但没有专长。在今后社会分工极细密的情况下，将怎么办？是让时代的车子在急转弯时摔出车外？还是坐上时代的车子前进到更美好的将来？……
    汽车经过天安门，燕燕跟小朋友拍着小手，唱起歌来，打断了倩一的思索。
    夜间，天气并不热，但户外比室内爽朗得多，孩子们由姥姥带着去北海了。倩一在院里等着丈夫回来吃晚饭。
    星星眨着眼睛，月光透过老杏树的枝叶，在地上筛下稀疏的斑点，院子里，美人蕉、大理菊、夜来香发出阵阵幽香。隔院那不幸的盲女又在专心练着钢琴，一曲奏完又一曲。倩一在院里踯躅着，一面等待丈夫，一面想着：
      “要有一技之长，不能就这样下去呵！隔壁那双目失明的阿葳，在这伟大的时代里也不自甘懈怠，她希望成为音乐家，因此夜夜在苦练着钢琴。我还年轻呐，即使今年重新考进大学，从头学四年，到毕业还不满四十岁。……只怕不学，那怕学得迟？……”。
    钢琴在奏着萧邦的名曲。无论这未来的盲音乐家也吧，无论这有着五个孩子的妈妈也吧，都沉醉在美好的想像里。
    蝉声一阵阵，天空探照灯交织成银色的图案，夜，北京的夏夜是这样的动人！这样的恬静！
    党委书记是个和善而严峻的老干部，经过长征，在民族解放战争中光荣地失去了左臂，身体很不好，但精神奋发，乐观，并且随时关心着同志们。部里谁有喜事或呕气都愿意找他谈谈，他会耐心地听同志们的叙述，然后合情合理地为同志们解决问题。
    倩一近来的心事，被党委书记看出来了。
      “为什么这几天说话少了？是不是那个常闹病的老四又病了？”党委书记问。
    “不！冯书记，孩子们都好，是我自己有个新鲜的想法，自己在盘算，解不开。”
      “唔！新鲜的想法？是啥玩意儿？”
      “我离开大学十八年了。当年希望自己成为化学家，其后参加革命丢下了专业，做着党要我做的工作，十多年来因为家累，我安于现状，不敢有奢想，如今最小的那个也已考进了小学，孩子们长进得很快，自己却落后了！我很想回母校去读完自己心爱的专业；要是再拖三年，年纪不允许我上学了。”倩一慢慢地说着，但内心的激动，使她嘴唇有些颤动。
    “好呀！这的确新鲜！值得考虑。但我要问你，你上学撇开家不管，孩子怎办？”
      “我的母亲刚从江西老家到北京了，他不满六十岁，身体很硬朗，能帮我料理家务。”
      “那你爱人会不会有什么意见呢？”
      “不会，他不是个自私的人，他懂得我的志趣。”
    “好吧！让我跟干部处长老薛研究一下，答复你。”
    一礼拜之后，倩一接到党委准许学习的通知。经过考试，录取到母校。全家都为此高兴，姥姥特别起劲，这一天她老人家中午不睡午觉，悄悄地去百货大楼，买了新的脸盆，手巾、肥皂盒、饭碗、筷子、枕头、牙缸……。东西比1937年倩一进大学时的考究得多。孩子们见了批评姥姥：“旧的还能用，姥姥又买新的，真浪费！”姥姥急了，忙作这样的解释：“你妈妈出嫁时，我在江西老家，没有半点陪送，如今买这几样东西，是补那年的陪送的。……”（附图片）
