Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The staff of the Central-South Industrial Building Design Institute exceeded the state plan for the third quarter by nearly 45%. They also exceeded the state plan in the first and second quarters, and were therefore awarded the honorary title of advanced collective in the Wuhan municipal construction system.

    The leadership of the Design Institute pointed out in summarizing the work: The basic reason for continuously exceeding the state plan for three consecutive quarters is the serious implementation of the Central Committee's policy on intellectuals, which has unprecedentedly improved the work enthusiasm and creativity of the engineering and technical personnel throughout the institute, and on this basis, vigorously carried out the advanced producer movement. According to statistics, more than 600 rationalization proposals were put forward in the entire design institute in three quarters, of which more than 80% were proposed by engineering and technical personnel. These large numbers of rationalization proposals have played a significant role in accelerating the design progress, improving the quality of drawings, and saving building materials.

    Before the second quarter of this year, the construction drawings designed by this design institute often had errors, averaging about fifteen errors per drawing, which affected the progress of the design. In response to the situation in the first quarter, the design institute's leadership took measures to improve the design quality in the second quarter. One of the important measures they took was to launch a quality improvement campaign centered on solving a specific outstanding problem, based on initiatives from the masses. For example, in the second quarter, they first launched an institute-wide campaign to eliminate drawing errors based on the initiative of Yang Jianchou and three others from the First Design Office to achieve "no accidents in one hundred drawings." During this period, the leadership paid attention to summarizing and exchanging the experiences of those who initiated and responded to the initiative, and regularly published their progress in implementing the initiative, so that the movement continued to develop extensively and deeply. In July, based on the experience gained in the previous stage, a "no errors in one hundred estimates and budgets" campaign was launched based on a new initiative from the masses, and this campaign also achieved remarkable results in September.

    Based on the experience created in the struggle to improve quality over the past six months, the Central-South Industrial Building Design Institute has gradually formulated and improved technical specifications and management systems to ensure that the design quality meets the standards. Now, the phenomenon of drawing errors has been basically eliminated, and the quality of factory building design is also constantly improving.

    For more than half a year, the Chinese Communist Party Committee of the Central-South Design Institute has strengthened its ties with engineering and technical personnel. In addition to designating responsible persons to receive them regularly and listen to their opinions and requirements, they also often invite some engineering and technical personnel to attend Party meetings as non-voting delegates. Seven engineers, after cultivation and education, have met the requirements for Party membership and have been admitted to the Party in accordance with the prescribed procedures. The administrative leadership of the institute also organized engineering and technical personnel to visit and study at home and abroad in the first half of the year, in order to increase their knowledge and improve their technical level. In addition, the leadership also helped improve the living environment of engineering and technical personnel and solve problems such as their children's schooling, so that they would not be distracted from their work due to life problems.

### 中南工业建筑设计院认真贯彻党对知识分子的政策  发挥技术人员积极性提高设计质量

    中南工业建筑设计院认真贯彻党对知识分子的政策
　　发挥技术人员积极性提高设计质量
    据新华社讯　中南工业建筑设计院的工作人员，超额近45％完成了第三季度的国家计划。他们在第一、二季度，也都超额完成了国家计划，并且曾经因此获得武汉市建筑系统先进集体的光荣称号。
    设计院领导方面在总结工作的时候指出：接连三个季度超额完成国家计划的基本原因，是认真地执行了中央关于知识分子的政策，使全院工程技术人员的工作积极性、创造性空前提高，并且在这个基础上大力开展了先进生产者运动。据统计，三个季度内全设计院共出现六百多项合理化建议，其中80％以上是工程技术人员提出的。这些大量出现的合理化建议，对加快设计进度、提高图纸质量、节约建筑材料，发挥了很大的作用。
    今年第二季度以前，这个设计院设计的施工图，经常发生差错，平均每张图纸有差错十五条左右。影响着设计的进度。针对第一季度的情况，设计院领导方面在第二季度中采取了提高设计质量的措施。他们采取的重要措施之一，是根据来自群众的倡议开展以解决某一方面的突出问题为中心的提高质量的运动。如在第二季度，即首先根据第一设计室杨建畴等四人提出的“百张图纸无事故”的倡议，开展了全院性的消灭图纸差错的运动。这期间，领导方面注意总结和交流倡议者、响应倡议者的经验，定期公布他们实现倡议的情况，使运动不断的广泛深入展开。7月份，在总结前一阶段经验的基础上，又根据群众的新倡议开了“百个概算、预算无差错”的运动，这个运动到9月份又取得了显著的成效。
    根据几个月来提高质量的斗争中创造的经验，中南工业建筑设计院已经逐步制定和健全了技术规范和管理制度，以保证设计质量合乎标准。现在，图纸差错的现象已经基本上消除了，厂房设计质量也在不断地提高。
    半年多以来，中南设计院的中共党委加强了同工程技术人员的联系，除了指定负责人定期接待他们，听取他们的意见和要求以外，还经常邀请部分工程技术人员列席党的会议。有七名工程师经过培养教育以后，达到了入党条件，已按照规定手续被接收入党。院行政领导方面，在上半年内还组织工程技术人员到国内外参观、访问，以此来增进他们的知识和提高他们的技术水平。此外，领导方面还帮助改善了工程技术人员的居住环境和解决他们的子女入学等问题，使他们不致因生活问题分散工作精力。
