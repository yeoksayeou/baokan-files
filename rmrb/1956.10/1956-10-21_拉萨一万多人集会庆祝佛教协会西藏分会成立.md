Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 20th. More than ten thousand monks, nuns, and laypeople gathered in Lhasa's People's Square on the 18th to celebrate the establishment of the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association of China. Groups of Buddhists braved the early snow to celebrate this festival in the square.

The Living Buddha Chijiang, representative of the Dalai Lama, and the Living Buddha Dingjie, representative of the Panchen Erdeni, spoke at the celebration. They expressed their gratitude for the Central Government's policy of freedom of religious belief and its ethnic policies, and encouraged Tibetan Buddhists to continue to enhance their patriotic ideology and further unite.

The Dalai Lama's Sutra Teacher, Living Buddha Lincang, first gave a detailed report on the history of the prosperity of Tibetan Buddhism at the meeting. Then he said that under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups, Tibet's politics, economy, and culture have continued to develop. In particular, on the basis of the correct implementation of the policy of freedom of religious belief and the policy of protecting temple income, the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association of China has been established, which further demonstrates that monks, nuns, and laypeople fully enjoy freedom of religious belief.

Living Buddha Lincang's speech was warmly applauded by the Buddhists. He spoke as the Vice President of the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association of China.

Living Buddha Lincang is very old and rarely goes out or participates in gatherings.

Chen Jingbo, representative of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, representative of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, both congratulated the meeting.

    达赖喇嘛的正经师林仓活佛，首先在大会上详细地报告了西藏佛教兴盛的历史。接着他说，在各民族人民伟大领袖毛主席的正确领导下，西藏的政治、经济和文化都不断地得到发展。特别是在正确执行了宗教信仰自由政策和保护寺庙收入的政策的基础上，又成立了中国佛教协会西藏分会，这更说明僧俗人民完全享受到了宗教信仰的自由。
    林仓活佛的讲话受到佛教徒们热烈鼓掌欢迎。他是作为中国佛教协会西藏分会副会长讲话的。
    林仓活佛因为年纪很大，过去很少外出和参加集会。
