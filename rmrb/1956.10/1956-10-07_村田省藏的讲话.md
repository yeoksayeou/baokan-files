Mr. Murata Shozo's Speech

Dear Chinese friends:

The Japanese Commodity Exhibition is now open.

First of all, I would like to express my heartfelt and deep gratitude to the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, as well as to your government and people, for the meticulous and immense support and assistance you have given us in the preparation of the exhibition.

As you all know, China and Japan are separated only by a narrow strip of water. For the past three thousand years, our two neighboring countries have lived together in friendship, like old friends.

At present, various circumstances have placed the relationship between the two countries in a very unnatural state, but we are eager to restore this traditional relationship as soon as possible, to form a permanent good-neighborly relationship, and to coexist and prosper together.

Recalling May of last year, when your country's trade delegation was invited to Tokyo and signed the Third Trade Agreement with the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade, the trade volume has reached 40 million pounds in the past year, and the recent transactions are still developing and expanding. This is all due to the rapid progress of New China's economic construction, the development of Japanese productivity, and the mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the two countries, which have linked the two sides together, which is really gratifying.

However, we cannot think that the current situation can satisfy both Japan and China. I believe that if we work harder to eliminate artificial obstacles in the future, the trade volume and varieties will soon be several times larger than they are now, and they will develop infinitely, which will be of inestimable benefit to enhancing the welfare of the people of both countries. Last autumn, your country held commodity exhibitions in Tokyo and Osaka, which achieved great success in promoting Japan-China trade. This was the largest foreign exhibition held in Japan after the war, and the content of the exhibition was rich, and it can be said to be a microcosm of China's economy. The Japanese people have now seen that raw materials such as coal, iron sand, rice, soybeans, and salt, which Japan currently imports from the United States and other distant countries, can be fully supplied by your neighboring country, and at the same time, they have understood other various situations, thereby deepening their understanding and knowledge of your country.

However, the Japanese Commodity Exhibition held today, due to the limitations of Japan's international situation, is not enough to show the full picture of Japan's economic strength, which we feel very sorry for. Nevertheless, due to the Japanese people's urgent desire for Japan-China trade and the understanding and support of the Japanese government, this exhibition is the largest one held by Japan abroad. The exhibits here all show the Japanese people's sincerity in wishing to contribute to China's economic construction.

From the two exhibitions held by Japan and China respectively, we can appreciate how much we need to exchange what we have for what we don't have and expand trade for the economic development of the two countries.

We believe that this exhibition will definitely help to sign and realize a new trade agreement, and we sincerely hope that this exhibition will further deepen the friendship and trust between the people of Japan and China and become the basis for the normalization of diplomatic relations.

Finally, I would like to wish China's construction and the friendly relations between the people of Japan and China to grow day by day.

### 村田省藏的讲话

专栏：

    村田省藏的讲话亲爱的中国朋友们：
    日本商品展览会现在开幕了。
    首先，我要向中国国际贸易促进委员会以及贵国政府、人民在展览会筹备工作中给予我们的无微不至的极大支持和协助，表示衷心的、深切的谢意。
    诸位都知道，中国和日本相隔只是一衣带水，在过去三千年中，我们两个邻邦友好相处，如同老朋友一样。
    目前，种种情况使两国的关系处在很不自然的状态下，但是我们热望能够早日恢复这个有传统的关系，结成永久的善邻，共存共荣。
    回忆去年5月，贵国贸易代表团应邀到东京，同日本国际贸易促进协会、日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟签订了第三次贸易协定，这一年来，贸易额达到四千万英镑，最近交易还在日益发展扩大。这都是由于新中国经济建设的突飞猛进，日本生产力的发展，加上两国人民的相互了解和友谊，把双方联结在一起，实在令人欣庆。
    但是我们不能认为目前的情况可以使日中两国满意。我相信：如果今后更加努力消除人为障碍的话，贸易额和品种就会很快地比现在扩大好几倍，就会无限地发展起来，这对增进两国人民的福利将有无可估量的裨益。去年秋天，贵国在东京和大阪举办了商品展览会，在促进日中贸易上获得很大的成就。这在日本战后举办的外国展览会当中，规模最大，展览会内容丰富，可以说是一幅中国经济的缩图。日本人民现在已经看到：日本目前从美国和其他遥远的国家所进口的煤、铁砂、大米、大豆、盐等等原料，邻近的贵国都是能够充分供应的，同时还明白了其他各种情况，从而加深了对贵国的了解和认识。
    不过，今天举办的日本商品展览会，由于受到日本国际处境的限制，还不足以表现出日本经济力量的全部面貌，这使我们感到非常遗憾。虽然如此，由于我们日本人民对日中贸易的迫切愿望以及日本政府的谅解和支持，这次展览会是日本在国外举办的规模最大的一个。这里展出的展品都表明着日本人民愿意对中国的经济建设有所贡献的诚意。
    从日中两国互相举办的两个展览会中，我们可以体会到：为了两国的经济发展，是多么需要彼此互通有无、扩大贸易。
    我们相信这个展览会一定很有助于签订和实现一个新的贸易协定，并且衷心希望这个展览会将进一步加深日中两国人民的友谊和信任，成为邦交正常化的基础。
    最后，谨祝中国建设和日中两国人民的友好关系日益增长。
