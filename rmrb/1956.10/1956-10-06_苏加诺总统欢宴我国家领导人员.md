Xinhua News Agency, October 5th: President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia held a grand banquet at the Beijing Hotel on October 5th—the 11th anniversary of the founding of the Indonesian Republic's armed forces—to honor Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China.

As President Sukarno, Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling entered the banquet hall, the more than one thousand Chinese and foreign guests in the hall stood and applauded for a long time. At the beginning of the banquet, the band played the national anthems of China and Indonesia.

President Sukarno spoke first at the banquet. He said that the six hundred million people of China are all peace-loving, friendship-loving, independence-loving, and unity-loving people. Such a nation will last forever.

He said that the Indonesian nation feels happy and fortunate to have such a nation as its friend, and the Indonesian nation will advance together with such a nation to realize all their ideals.

When the President spoke about the 11th anniversary of the founding of the Indonesian Republic's armed forces, he said that the establishment of the Indonesian armed forces was to defend independence, not to invade others or other nations. If Indonesia's independence is violated, the Indonesian armed forces will definitely rise up to defend independence. In its more than two thousand years of history, Indonesia has never expanded outward and has never practiced colonialism or imperialism. The Indonesian people love peace and independence.

President Sukarno proposed a toast to the prosperity of the Chinese people, to the friendly relations between the Chinese and Indonesian people, to world peace, and to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong.

Chairman Mao Zedong then spoke at the banquet, congratulating Indonesia on its Army Day and wishing the heroic armed forces of the Republic of Indonesia even greater achievements in the struggle to achieve the ideals of the Indonesian people. Chairman Mao said that the ideals of the Indonesian people—the ideal of independence, the ideal of peace, the ideal of a new world—are also the ideals of the Chinese people. In order to achieve these ideals, the Chinese people stand on the same front as the Indonesian people and will always be loyal comrades-in-arms of the Indonesian people.

Chairman Mao Zedong proposed a toast to the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people, and to the health of the President of the Republic of Indonesia, the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia, His Excellency Sukarno.

Indonesian Foreign Minister Abdulgani, speaking at the banquet, thanked the Chinese government and Chairman Mao Zedong on behalf of the Indonesian government for inviting President Sukarno to visit China on a state visit. Abdulgani said that President Sukarno is an engineer; he did not build steel bridges, but he is building bridges of friendship and understanding between countries. In China, we have found another builder of bridges of friendship and understanding between countries—Chairman Mao Zedong. Abdulgani invited the guests to join him in a toast to the people who build spiritual bridges and to the success of the Chinese people's cause of building a new society.

Premier Zhou Enlai then spoke, thanking Foreign Minister Abdulgani for his congratulations to the Chinese government. Premier Zhou said that through President Sukarno's visit and meeting with Chairman Mao Zedong, the bridge of friendship between the eighty-two million Indonesian people and the six hundred million Chinese people has been linked across mountains and oceans. This bridge of friendship between the people is forever indestructible and will last forever. Premier Zhou proposed a toast to the eternal friendship between the Indonesian and Chinese people and to the health of all the distinguished Indonesian guests.

Invited to attend the banquet were Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, Vice Premiers Chen Yun, Peng Dehuai, Deng Xiaoping, He Long, Chen Yi, Ulanhu, Li Fuchun, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Marshal Nie Rongzhen, Marshal Ye Jianying, Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, Long Yun, President of the Supreme People's Court Dong Biwu, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference He Xiangning, Zhang Bojun, Deputy Foreign Minister Zhang Wentian, Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia Huang Zhen, President of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association Bao Erhan, as well as heads of various departments of state organs, senior generals of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life in Beijing.
