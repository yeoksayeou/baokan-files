    Independently Designed Based on Local Conditions
    Jiangxi Machinery Factory Designed Coal Gas Engine Successfully Trial-Produced
    (Our Newspaper News) A double-cylinder vertical 20-horsepower coal gas engine, independently designed by technical personnel in Jiangxi Province to suit local resources, natural characteristics, and specific usage conditions, was successfully trial-produced at the Jiangxi Machinery Factory on September 30.
    Previously, there were very few independently designed coal gas engines in China. Taking Jiangxi Machinery Factory as an example, the 10- to 20-horsepower coal gas engines produced over the years were all imitations of other brother factories, which in turn were imitations of those from Germany, Japan, and other countries, and were all products from around 1930. In the first half of this year, the old-fashioned 20-horsepower coal gas engine produced by Jiangxi Machinery Factory according to these drawings weighed about two tons. In addition to the bulky machine body, only one could be transported in a truck, and a flywheel required eight people to lift (each weighing 850 jin). When transporting a machine from the railway station or pier to the countryside, it required mobilizing hundreds of laborers. Moreover, operation and management were inconvenient, and parts were prone to failure, causing much dissatisfaction among farmers.
    The newly designed coal gas engine is equipped with a double pre-combustion flame tube to replace the complex electrical structure of the old coal gas engine - low-voltage magneto ignition, making engine starting simple and accurate, and the parts are not easily damaged. Due to the simple structure, an ordinary farmer can fully master the operating technology after only one or two months of learning. Moreover, the machine body is light and agile, with a metal consumption of only 35 kilograms per horsepower. The total machine net weight is 700 kilograms, and it can be easily moved and installed, facilitating the needs of agricultural water conservancy and irrigation. Manufacturing this type of coal gas engine can also save the country a large amount of steel, and the manufacturing cost per unit is only slightly more than one-half of that of the old coal gas engine.

    按照本地具体条件进行独立设计
    江西机械厂设计的煤气机试制成功
    本报讯　由江西省技术人员独立设计的、适合当地的资源、自然特点及使用的具体条件的双缸立式二十匹马力煤气机，已于9月30日在江西机械厂试制成功。
    以前，国内很少有自行设计的煤气机，以江西机械厂来说，历年来所生产的十至二十匹马力的煤气机，都是仿制其它兄弟厂的，其它兄弟厂又都是仿制德、日等国家的，而且都是1930年前后的产品。今年上半年，江西机械厂仿照这种图纸生产出来的老式二十匹马力煤气机，重约两吨，加上机体庞大，一部汽车只能装运一台，一个飞轮就得八个人抬（每个重八百五十市斤），把一台机器从承运的车站或码头运往农村时，需要动员好几百个劳动力。而且操纵管理不便，机件容易发生故障，农民对此很有意见。
    新设计的煤气机，装有双重预燃火管代替老式煤气机的复杂电气结构——低压磁电机点火，发动引擎既简便又准确，而且机件不易损坏。由于结构简单，一个普通农民只要学习一、两个月就可以完全掌握操纵的技术。而且机体身轻灵巧，每一马力的金属消耗量只有三十五公斤，全部机器净重七百公斤，可以随时折迁安装，便利农业水利灌溉的需要。制造这种煤气机还可为国家节省大量的钢铁，并且每台的制造成本也只等于老式煤气机的二分之一强。
