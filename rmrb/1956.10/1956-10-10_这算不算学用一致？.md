    Does This Count as Applying What You Learn?
    Question: Students graduating from the Analytical Chemistry major of the Chemical Engineering Department of an industrial school, who studied inorganic (chemical) analysis and testing at school, are assigned to work in sugar factories and wineries. Does this count as applying what they learned?

    Answer: We have received several letters similar to this. For example, some people reflect that some graduates of the Mechanical Engineering Department of universities, after being assigned to light industrial enterprises or chemical industrial enterprises, also feel that what they learned is not being applied, and they are not at ease in their work, insisting on being transferred to mechanical factories. Of course, it is most ideal to have those who study mechanics go to mechanical factories, and those who study inorganic chemical analysis go to factories that apply inorganic chemical analysis. However, it is not only not a mismatch of learning to have those who study mechanics go to light industrial factories, and those who study inorganic chemical analysis go to wineries and sugar factories, as long as they are truly undertaking technical work, but also, in the current situation, it is reasonable and necessary. Such things not only happened in the past, exist now, but will also continue to happen in the future.
    Why is it said to be reasonable? Because modern light industry and modern chemical industry both use mechanical production. Since there is machinery, there needs to be a certain number of engineering and technical personnel who understand mechanical principles, otherwise there will be no one responsible for leading the maintenance and repair of machinery. This is just like the fact that there are a certain number of language teachers in industrial schools. Why is it also reasonable to have those who study inorganic chemical analysis go to wineries and sugar factories? This is because those who study inorganic chemical analysis are also familiar with organic chemical analysis. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Higher Education: any analytical testing major has six required courses, only one of which is combined with the business of the competent authority. And the study hours for this course combined with the business of the competent authority only account for about one-quarter of the six required courses. That is to say, those who study inorganic analysis and testing must also take five courses, including organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, and general chemistry. With these basic knowledge, they can quickly master production operations when they go to sugar factories and wineries; at the same time, as long as they do technical work, they can fully exert their talents in sugar factories and wineries.
    Why is it said to be necessary? This is because the development of our country's economic construction is very rapid at present, and the department settings of the education department have not yet and cannot immediately achieve such a precise division of labor as the economic work departments. Taking the brewing and sugar industries as examples, there are currently no brewing or sugar-making majors in universities or vocational schools. Can the country wait until universities and vocational schools have established sugar-making and brewing majors before building sugar factories and wineries? Of course not. So where do the engineering and technical personnel of sugar factories and wineries come from? In order to meet the needs of industrial production, it is certainly very necessary for the state to send a portion of university graduates with roughly similar majors to sugar factories and wineries.

    这算不算学用一致？
    问：工业学校化工科分析化学专业毕业学生，在学校里学的是无机（化学）分析化验，被分配到糖厂、酒厂工作，算不算学用一致？
  　地方国营广东佛山酒厂　李继汉、许键玲、胡焕锦
    答：类似这种来信，本报收到过几封，如有的人反映，有些大学机械系的毕业生，分配到轻工业企业或化学工业企业里以后，也认为学非所用，不安心工作，非要求调到机械工厂里去不可。当然，学机械的到机械厂里去，学无机化学分析的到应用无机化学分析的工厂里去，这是最理想的学用一致。但是，学机械的到轻工业工厂里去，学无机化学分析的到酿酒厂、制糖厂里去，只要是真正担负技术工作，不但不是学用不一致，而且在目前来说，是合理的，也是必要的。这样的事，不仅过去有、现在有，将来也还会有。
    为什么说是合理的呢？因为现代的轻工业，现代的化学工业，都是使用机械生产的，既然有机械，就需要有一定数量的懂得机械原理的工程技术人员，否则就没有人负责领导机械的维护和检修工作。这好比工业学校里，也有一定数量的语文教师一个道理。学无机化学分析的到酿酒厂、制糖厂里去，为什么也是合理的呢？这是因为学无机化学分析的人，也熟悉有机化学分析业务。根据高等教育部的规定：任何分析化验专业，都有六门必修课程，其中只有一门是结合主管部门的业务的。而这门结合主管部门业务的功课的学时，也只占六门必修课程的四分之一左右。这就是说，学无机分析化验的，也必修了有机化学、分析化学和普通化学等五门课程。有了这些基本知识，到糖厂酒厂工作，就可以很快掌握生产业务；同时，只要是做技术工作，在糖厂酒厂也是可以充分发挥他们的才能的。
    为什么说是必要的呢？这是因为目前我国经济建设的发展很快，教育部门的科系设置还没有也不可能马上做到像经济工作部门那样精密分工。就以酿酒、制糖工业来说，目前在各大学、专业学校里，都没有酿酒专业、制糖专业。国家能不能等到在大学、专科学校里设立了制糖、酿酒专业以后，才建立糖厂、酒厂呢？当然不能。那么糖厂、酒厂的工程技术人员又从那里来呢？为了满足工业生产的需要，国家把一部分专业大致相近的大学毕业生派到糖厂、酒厂里去，当然就是很必要的了。
