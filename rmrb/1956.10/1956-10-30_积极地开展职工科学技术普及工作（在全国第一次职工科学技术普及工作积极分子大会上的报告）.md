Comrades:

The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out in its resolution on the political report that our party has led the Chinese people to complete the bourgeois democratic revolution and has basically achieved victory in the socialist revolution. The current main contradiction in our country is the contradiction between the people's demand for the establishment of an advanced industrial country and the reality of a backward agricultural country, and the contradiction between the people's need for rapid economic and cultural development and the current economic and cultural situation that cannot meet the people's needs. "The essence of this contradiction, under the conditions that China's socialist system has been established, is the contradiction between the advanced socialist system and the backward social productive forces." The current main task of the Party and the people of the whole country is to concentrate our efforts to resolve the contradiction, and transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country as soon as possible.

To resolve the contradiction between the advanced socialist system and the backward social productive forces, one of the important keys is to improve the level of science and technology in our country; to cultivate the working class of our country into a class with a high level of culture, science, and technology; and to gradually apply the achievements of modern science and technology to our country's construction cause. However, precisely on this point, we have significant weaknesses. At present, although some scientists in our country have reached or are close to the world's advanced level, generally speaking, whether in terms of the number of scientific workers or the level of scientific research, we are still backward. At the same time, the cultural level and scientific and technological level of the working class are still very low. Because of this, the Party has put forward the call to "march towards science," and proposed that within twelve years, the most urgently needed scientific and technological departments in our country should approach the world's advanced level. Of course, to complete this arduous task, we mainly rely on the efforts of scientific workers. However, improving the scientific and technological level of the broad masses of employees is closely related to cultivating a large number of scientists and improving the level of scientific research. The broad masses of employees need the help of scientists, and scientists also need the help of the broad masses of employees. The two must be closely combined. Only in this way can we rapidly improve our scientific and technological level and smoothly carry out our socialist construction. Therefore, we not only require scientific workers to improve the level of scientific research, but also require them to unremittingly improve the cultural, scientific, and technological level of employees, that is, to popularize scientific and technological knowledge among employees.

At present, due to the rapid development of factories and mines, the large increase in new workers, and the transfer of many experienced veteran technical workers to support new factories and mines or their promotion to administrative management cadres, the average technical level of workers has shown a relative downward trend. Therefore, in factories and mines, it has become almost a universal phenomenon for low-level workers to do the work of high-level workers. Even in those factories equipped with the latest precision technology equipment, the average technical level of general workers is only three or four, and there are very few eight-level workers. This situation is extremely inconsistent with objective needs. Our country is building many new large enterprises equipped with advanced technology, and our existing enterprises will also be gradually technically transformed. If our workers, technicians, and engineers do not learn and master modern science and technology in the face of such modern equipment, they will not be able to work. Workers and scientific and technical workers understand this situation. Therefore, the enthusiasm of scientific and technical workers for carrying out scientific and technological popularization work for workers and the enthusiasm of workers for learning scientific and technological knowledge are very high. Scientific and technical workers' reports on science and technology to workers are very popular with workers. Workers are willing to discuss production technology issues with scientific and technical workers, and even go to their homes in their spare time to ask them about science and technology issues. This situation has also encouraged scientific and technical workers to engage in popular science work, and they have contributed a lot of effort to popular science work. For example, Professor Zhao Xuetian from Huazhong Institute of Technology, who is present here, once compiled a "Crash Course in Blueprint Reading" for mechanical workers. After this method was promoted nationwide, it played an active role in rapidly improving the technical level of mechanical workers and improving workers' labor efficiency. To this end, he recently wrote a "Crash Course in Drafting" manuscript to help workers learn drafting. Of course, this is just one example. After the Party Central Committee convened the Intellectuals Conference and put forward the call to "march towards science," the enthusiasm of scientific and technical workers to impart knowledge to the working people has been greatly increased. In the past three months, more than 7,000 scientific and technical workers in Shanghai have joined the popular science association organization, and scientific and technical workers in many places have asked the popular science association for tasks. This situation shows that the political awareness and socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of scientific and technical workers have been further improved. From the perspective of employees, learning scientific and technological knowledge and improving their own cultural, scientific, and technological level has become the common desire and urgent requirement of the broad masses of employees. In technical schools in factories and mines across the country, there is an almost universal phenomenon of 100 admissions, 1,000 applications, and so many people auditing that they break down the doors and windows. Many grassroots units' employees have automatically organized scientific and technological learning groups, or spontaneously signed teaching contracts. This situation is quite common.

There are many ways to improve the scientific and technological level of employees. At present, amateur technical schools run by the administrative departments of factories and mines are a relatively formal and systematic way to improve the technical level of employees. This method is important. Scientific and technological popularization work is another important method. The advantage of scientific and technological popularization activities is that they are flexible and diverse, the objects are relatively broad, the scale can be large or small, they can adapt to the learning conditions of employees of different types of work, different times, and different levels, and they can also better meet the various requirements of employees for learning scientific and technological knowledge. Therefore, in the work of helping employees improve their scientific and technological level, scientific and technological popularization work should be placed in an appropriate position.

Carrying out scientific and technological popularization work among employees is one of the important methods to enrich employees' scientific knowledge and improve their technical level. It is also an effective method to carry out communist education for employees and help them establish a materialist ideology. In the past, after various places held crash courses and classes on blueprint reading for mechanical workers, almost all the workers who participated in the study understood how to read blueprints and construct according to the blueprints. After publicizing the scientific principles of advanced experiences, workers were willing to learn advanced experiences and mastered these advanced experiences relatively quickly. In the past, some workers had deep superstitious ideas, but after listening to lectures on basic knowledge of natural science, they no longer believed in the superstitious ideas of ghosts and gods. In short, the development of scientific and technological popularization work has played a certain role in the production work of factories and mines and the ideological education work of employees.

II

In recent years, trade unions and popular science associations have cooperated, under the leadership of the Party and with the assistance of various relevant parties, to carry out scientific and technological popularization work for the broad masses of employees and their families. In terms of production technology knowledge publicity, many places have held lectures on "Crash Course in Blueprint Reading for Mechanical Workers," "Sand Casting," "Mechanical Manufacturing," "Electric Motors," "Textile Technology," "Metal Cutting," and so on. In Jinan, Shenyang, Dalian and other six cities alone, 6,171 employees participated in the crash course in blueprint reading. A lot of work has also been done on scientific explanations of advanced experiences. In terms of publicity on new achievements in science and technology, publicity has been carried out on the peaceful use of atomic energy, semiconductors, and so on. In terms of publicity on basic knowledge of natural science, lectures have been held on basic knowledge of natural science such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, geography, and solar and lunar eclipses. In terms of publicity on labor protection and hygiene knowledge, various places have carried out publicity on industrial safety, maternal and child health, and so on.

In carrying out the above-mentioned publicity, in addition to holding lectures and publicity, various places have also carried out publicity on various scientific and technological knowledge for employees and their families through exhibitions, broadcasts, blackboards, and other means, or by publishing popular science books and periodicals. A lot of work has also been done in assisting enterprise administrations in running amateur technical schools and technical training classes, and in organizing mutual teaching and learning. In particular, after the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization formulated and released a cooperation plan for carrying out scientific and technological publicity work for employees in January this year, many trade unions and popular science association organizations strengthened their leadership and cooperation in employee popular science work, which further developed employee scientific and technological popularization work and produced a large number of activists.

Through the development of employee popular science work, scientific and technical workers have begun to be organized, and the cooperation between scientific and technical workers and production workers has gradually been strengthened. In recent years, the relationship between workers and scientific and technical workers in factories and mines has undergone fundamental changes. They have established a relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation. This mutual assistance and cooperation has played and is playing a great role in improving production and innovating technology. In particular, after popular science work groups were established in factories and mines across the country, the enthusiasm of scientific and technical workers was further brought into play, and the cooperation and unity between scientific and technical workers and production workers were further strengthened. The cooperative relationship between factories and mines and scientific research institutions is also beginning to be established.

At present, employee scientific and technological popularization work is not widespread and deep enough. There are also formalism and lack of planning in the work. These shortcomings must be overcome.

Carrying out scientific and technological popularization work should serve socialist construction, serve production, and serve the masses. Therefore, when carrying out this work, we must implement the policy of combining production, combining practice, and striving for breadth.

Combining production means carrying out scientific and technological popularization work according to the needs of factory and mine production and construction. This requires considering the current production problems of factories and mines, as well as the problems that will arise after further development of production; considering the problems of employees in their current labor, as well as the problems of further improving labor productivity. Combining production requires scientific analysis of the problems in production and advanced experiences, and explaining them by elevating them to scientific and technological theory. Carrying out scientific and technological popularization work in this way can both help production and promote the development of scientific and technological popularization work.

Combining practice means carrying out work according to the actual situation of factories and mines and the actual needs of employees. Of course, combining production is also combining practice, but combining practice is not only combining production. In the past, when employees were studying the general line of the state during the transition period and China's first five-year plan in many places, publicity on scientific knowledge of socialist industrialization was carried out in a timely manner, which achieved very good results. Employees' requirements are multifaceted. In addition to their needs in production, they have other needs. For example, medical and health knowledge and a lot of knowledge about natural phenomena are all needed by employees and can and should be publicized to employees. We must be good at carrying out popular science activities according to the different requirements of employees in various aspects. To do this, trade union cadres and popular science members need to go deep among the masses frequently to understand the thoughts and requirements of the masses, and carry out popular science activities in a planned way through various forms. When carrying out this work, we also need to pay attention to the actual level, spare time, and living habits of employees, and adapt to these situations so that scientific and technological popularization work can be carried out more effectively.

According to the above-mentioned policy of employee popular science work, in popular science work, we should vigorously carry out publicity on production technology knowledge and scientific explanations of advanced experiences, and at the same time, we should also appropriately carry out publicity on basic knowledge of natural science, common sense of hygiene, and knowledge of safe production.

In carrying out employee popular science work, we should adopt small-scale, diverse, easy-to-understand, and voluntary participation practices. Only by adopting these practices can popular science work be widespread and deep.

Small-scale and diverse means that the content and form should be diverse, and the scale should mainly be small-scale, but large-scale is not excluded. The number of listeners can be large or small for each lecture. Lectures can be given to a dozen people or hundreds of people. For example, the Shanghai Dalong Machinery Factory has held 304 large and small scientific and technological lectures and broadcast scientific and technological knowledge 110 times in the past three years, averaging more than 130 times per year, combining production and employee requirements. Their lecture forms include systematic lectures and thematic lectures; large-scale reports and small-scale lectures divided by type of work, workshop, shift, and in-depth office. Each lecture lasts for a maximum of two hours, usually one hour to one and a half hours. Sometimes lectures are also given during the after-meal rest time (half an hour). Because they adopted a small-scale and diverse approach, they have always been able to persist in carrying out scientific and technological lectures without stopping in this factory, which has undergone great changes in the process of transformation over the past three years. The benefit of adopting a small-scale and diverse approach is that lectures can be given at any time, any place, and with any number of people, which can better meet the requirements of employees; at the same time, it can also provide more opportunities for scientific and technical workers to actively participate in popular science work.

Reports and lectures should be given in a popular and lively way, so that the audience can easily understand them, so as to arouse the audience's interest in science and technology and attract the masses to learn science and technology. Obscure, difficult to understand, and boring lectures and reports are not popular with the masses. According to the experience of various places, to make reports easy to understand, do not only talk about theory, but try to connect them with the actual things that employees are familiar with, and also try to use scientific films, slides, models, instruments, specimens, pictures and other visual publicity materials to help the audience understand the content of the report.

Voluntary participation is a principle that trade union organizations and popular science associations must implement in carrying out popular science work. Chairman Mao taught us: "All work that requires the participation of the masses will become a mere formality and fail if the masses are not conscious and voluntary." Popular science work is a mass publicity and education work. This work can only be widely carried out and play its due role on the basis of the conscious and voluntary participation of the masses. Coercive and commanding practices are absolutely not allowed. However, emphasizing voluntary participation cannot be passive waiting, but should enrich the content of publicity and improve the methods of publicity to attract the masses and make them active participants in popular science activities.

III

China's first five-year plan is about to be overfulfilled. The Party Central Committee has also put forward suggestions on the second five-year plan. There is no doubt that as our socialist construction cause develops further, the requirements for the scientific and technological level of employees will inevitably be higher. Therefore, we must raise the scientific and technological popularization work of employees to an important position. Trade unions and popular science associations must universally and regularly carry out popularization work on scientific and technological knowledge among employees across the country, mobilize, organize, and help the broad masses of employees learn scientific and technological knowledge, improve their scientific and technological level, and gradually change the backward state of the culture and scientific and technological level of the working class in our country, so as to accelerate the process of socialist construction in our country.

To strengthen scientific and technological popularization work, we must first effectively strengthen the organizational leadership and ideological leadership of scientific and technological popularization work for employees. It should be pointed out that since scientific and technological popularization work for employees is still a new work, there are still many problems in the current work. We must work hard to solve these problems.

The central issue in strengthening the leadership of scientific and technological popularization work for employees is to summarize and promote good experiences in this work. Facts have proved that promoting advanced experiences is always an important way to improve work. Therefore, we should pay attention to the experiences in our work and seriously summarize and promote them. This meeting is also a conference to summarize and promote advanced experiences in popular science work and a conference of advanced workers in popular science work.

It must also be pointed out that strengthening the leadership of employee popular science work should further strengthen the planning of employee popular science work. This year, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization jointly formulated and released a cooperation plan for carrying out popular science work for employees, which has played a positive role in promoting the development of employee popular science work across the country. Therefore, in addition to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization jointly making national plans, it is required that trade union organizations and popular science sub-associations and branch associations in various provinces (autonomous regions) and cities, and industrial trade unions, make provincial, municipal, and industrial plans based on the actual situation of the region and industry and the needs of employees, and formulate annual plans. Cities and grassroots should also make more specific plans. Trade unions and popular science association organizations at all levels need to strengthen the inspection of the implementation of popular science work plans. Of course, plans and requirements should be realistic and appropriate. When actively carrying out scientific and technological popularization work for employees, we must remember that today's labor of employees in our country is still very heavy; the education we carry out for employees is not only scientific and technological popularization education, and the studies of employees are also very tense; and some employees are still semi-literate or even illiterate. For these employees with particularly low levels of education, their most urgent requirement is to become literate. Therefore, it is also wrong and unfeasible to only emphasize scientific and technological popularization without considering other work and the conditions of employees' spare time and other conditions and to put forward excessive requirements.

Employee scientific and technological popularization work is a part of the communist education that trade unions carry out for employees, and it must become a regular work content of the trade union propaganda department.

Second, we must strengthen the cooperation between trade union organizations and popular science association organizations. This is an important guarantee for the smooth development of employee scientific and technological popularization work. For example, in the past, the trade union organization and popular science work group of the Shenyang Heating Equipment Factory did not cooperate well, and sometimes they could not even hold lectures. Later, they strengthened their cooperation, and popular science work developed. In the process of cooperation, trade unions and popular science organizations should also have a division of labor. Generally speaking, the propaganda, production, labor protection, and women worker and family committees of trade union organizations should study popular science topics, make suggestions to popular science branch associations and popular science work groups, and jointly formulate propaganda plans, which are controlled and implemented by trade union clubs and workshop trade union organizations. Popular science associations and popular science work groups should be responsible for mobilizing members and non-members to engage in popularization work, and helping speakers prepare lectures and improve the quality of publicity. The issue of cooperation is not a problem that all trade unions and popular science association organizations have completely solved, and we still need to pay close attention to it.

In addition, trade union and popular science association organizations must also obtain the leadership of the Party, the support of the enterprise administration, and the cooperation of the Communist Youth League. With the leadership of the Party, our work can be carried out correctly; with the support of the administration in terms of manpower and material resources and the cooperation of the Communist Youth League, we can do more and better work.

Third, in carrying out scientific and technological popularization work for employees, we must rely on activists and give full play to their leading role, bridging role, and backbone role. We know that activists live among the masses, and they have close relationships with the masses. Giving full play to the role of activists is also very important in scientific and technological popularization work. Trade unions and popular science association organizations are both mass organizations, and this nature determines that they can only make popular science work active and full of vitality by relying on the broad masses of activists. However, to rely on activists, we must strengthen the leadership and education of activists, organize them, boldly let go, and assign tasks to them. We must also fully promote democracy, discuss matters with them, and regularly understand their opinions and requirements for work, and help them solve difficulties in their work. Only in this way can their enthusiasm be fully brought into play.

Strengthening leadership, strengthening cooperation, and widely relying on activists to carry out work are the issues that should be paid special attention to in the current scientific and technological popularization work for employees. These issues are the key to our improving our work. We hope that trade unions and popular science association organizations in various places will summarize the experience in this area and widely carry out scientific and technological popularization work for employees.

IV

Finally, I would like to talk about the attitude and methods of learning science and technology. We know that in all our work, especially production work, we are in contact with scientific and technological issues at every moment. Therefore, it is possible and should be possible to learn science and technology in every work post. We hope to attract most employees to study. In learning, we should have a humble attitude, help each other, study hard, and persevere to the end. Mastering scientific and technological knowledge is not easy, but as long as we are determined to follow the path from low to high and from shallow to deep, and move forward step by step, we will definitely achieve results.

In our country, there are many people who have persistently learned scientific and technological knowledge and achieved great achievements. For example, Li Baolin, a young worker from the Tianjin Dongya Wool and Linen Factory, in addition to working hard to learn science and technology in production work and amateur schools, also gets up early and sleeps late every day to study radio science, optics, motor application, mathematics, physics, and other courses by himself. Therefore, his technical and theoretical level has improved. With the help of experienced masters and technicians, he has successively improved and created instruments such as the "Electric Tide Meter," the "Photoelectric Colorimeter," and the "Photoelectric Control Coarse Spinning Sliver Uniformity Meter," which are all instruments with a high level in the textile industry. Professor Hua Luogeng, a famous scientist in our country, only studied in middle school in the past, but he became a mathematician with international reputation through hard study. They are our role models.

Scientific workers and engineering and technical personnel are an important force in the socialist construction of our country, and they are also a strong force in the current popularization of scientific and technological knowledge among employees. They have made significant contributions to the construction of the motherland, and they have also made significant contributions to carrying out scientific and technological popularization work for the broad masses of employees. We believe that in the future, they will make more and greater contributions.

Comrades, our task of building a socialist motherland is extremely great and extremely arduous. To build a backward agricultural country into a socialist industrial country, we must catch up with the world's advanced scientific level. "Only by mastering the most advanced science can we have a solid national defense, a strong advanced economic force, and sufficient conditions to unite with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries to defeat imperialist countries in peaceful competition or in the wars of aggression launched by the enemy" (Zhou Enlai: Report on the Issue of Intellectuals). To catch up with the world's advanced scientific level, to master the most advanced science, not only scientific workers need to double their efforts, but also the broad masses of employees must double their efforts to learn science and technology. We believe that under the leadership and support of the Party and the government, with the cooperation of relevant parties, and with the efforts of our large number of popular science work activists, the glorious Chinese working class will also be able to achieve brilliant achievements in learning culture, science, and technology!

    积极地开展职工科学技术普及工作
    （在全国第一次职工科学技术普及工作积极分子大会上的报告）
    赖若愚
    一同志们：
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会在关于政治报告的决议中指出，我们党领导中国人民，已经完成了资产阶级民主革命，并且基本上取得了社会主义革命的胜利。当前我国国内的主要矛盾，是人民对于建立先进的工业国的要求同落后的农业国的现实之间的矛盾，是人民对于经济文化迅速发展的需要同当前经济文化不能满足人民需要的状况之间的矛盾。“这一矛盾的实质，在我国社会主义制度已经建立的情况下，也就是先进的社会主义制度同落后的社会生产力之间的矛盾”。党和全国人民的当前的主要任务，就是要集中力量来解决这个矛盾，把我国尽快地从落后的农业国变为先进的工业国。
    要解决先进的社会主义制度同落后的社会生产力之间的矛盾，重要的关键之一就是提高我国的科学技术水平；把我国工人阶级培养成为具有高度文化、科学、技术水平的阶级；并且把现代的科学技术成就，逐步地应用到我国建设事业中来。可是恰恰在这一点上，我们有重大的弱点。现在，我国虽然已经有一部分科学家达到或者接近世界先进水平，可是一般说来，不管在科学工作者的数量上或者在科学研究的水平上，都还是落后的。同时，工人阶级的文化水平和科学技术水平还是很低的。正因为这样，所以党提出了“向科学进军”的号召，并提出在十二年之内，要使我国最急需的科学技术部门接近世界的先进水平。当然，要完成这个艰巨的任务，主要是依靠科学工作者的努力。可是提高广大职工的科学技术水平，对于培养大量的科学家和提高科学研究水平是有密切关系的。广大职工需要科学家的帮助，科学家们也需要广大职工的帮助，二者必须密切地结合起来。只有这样，才能迅速地提高我们的科学技术水平，才可以顺利地进行我们的社会主义建设。因此，我们不只是要求科学工作者提高科学研究水平，同时，也要求不懈怠地提高职工的文化科学技术水平，即在职工中普及科学技术知识。
    目前，由于厂矿企业的迅速发展，新工人的大量增加，很多有经验的老技术工人调去支援新的厂矿企业，或被提拔为行政管理干部，因而，工人的平均技术等级已有相对下降的趋势。所以，在厂矿企业中，低级工干高级工的活，几乎成了普遍的现象。即使是那些以最新的精密的技术设备装备起来的工厂，一般工人的平均技术等级也只有三、四级，八级工很少。这种情况是与客观需要极不相称的。我国正在建设着许多新的以先进技术装备起来的大企业，我国的原有企业，也将要逐步地进行技术改造。我们的工人、技术员、工程师面对着这样的近代化设备，如果不学习与掌握现代的科学技术，就会无法工作。工人、科学技术工作者是了解这一情况的，因之，科学技术工作者向工人进行科学技术普及工作和工人学习科学技术知识的热情是很高的。科学技术工作者向工人作科学技术报告很受工人欢迎。工人都愿意和科学技术工作者研究生产技术问题，甚至在业余时间到他们家里去请教科学技术问题。这种情形，也鼓舞了科学技术工作者从事科普工作的积极性，他们在科普工作中贡献了很多力量。例如在座的华中工学院教授赵学田同志，曾经为机械工人编制了“速成看图法”，这个方法在全国推广以后，对于迅速提高机械工人的技术水平和提高工人的劳动效率，起了积极作用。为此，他最近又编写了“速成制图”讲稿，帮助工人学习制图。当然，这只是例子之一。在党中央召开了知识分子会议和提出“向科学进军”的号召之后，科学技术工作者把知识交给劳动人民的热情十分高涨。在过去三个月内，上海市就有七千多名科学技术工作者参加了科普协会组织，许多地方的科学技术工作者向科普协会要任务。这种情况说明，广大的科学技术工作者的政治觉悟和社会主义积极性有了进一步的提高。从职工方面来说，学习科学技术知识，提高自己的文化科学技术水平，已经成为广大职工的共同愿望和迫切要求了。各地厂矿企业的技术学校，几乎普遍存在着招生一百，报名一千，旁听的人多得挤破门窗的现象。有不少基层单位的职工，自动组织了科学技术学习小组，或者自发地签订教学合同。这种情形是相当普遍的。
    提高职工的科学技术水平的方式是多种多样的。目前厂矿企业行政方面举办的业余技术学校，是一种比较正规的系统的提高职工技术水平的方式，这种方式是重要的；科学技术普及工作，是另一种重要方式。科学技术普及活动的好处是灵活多样，对象比较广泛，规模可大可小，能够适应不同工种、不同时间、不同程度的职工的学习条件，也能够更多地满足职工学习科学技术知识的各种各样的要求。因此，在帮助职工提高科学技术水平的工作中，应该把科学技术普及工作放在适当的位置上来。
    开展职工科学技术普及工作，是丰富职工科学知识，提高他们的技术水平的重要方法之一，也是对职工进行共产主义教育，帮助他们树立唯物主义思想的有效方法之一。过去各地举办机械工人速成看图讲座和学习班之后，参加学习的工人几乎全部都懂得了看图和按图施工；经过宣传先进经验的科学道理之后，工人都乐意学习先进经验，并且比较迅速地掌握了这些先进经验。过去有些工人迷信观念很深，可是听了自然科学基础知识讲演之后，他们就不再相信有鬼有神的迷信思想了。总而言之，科学技术普及工作的开展，对于厂矿企业生产工作和职工思想教育工作，已经起了一定的作用。
    二
    几年来，工会与科普协会组织合作，在党的领导和各有关方面的协助下，曾经向广大职工和他们的家属进行了科学技术普及工作。在生产技术知识宣传方面，许多地方举办了“机械工人速成看图”、“翻砂”、“机械制造”、“电机”、“纺织技术”、“金属切削”等等讲座。仅济南、沈阳、旅大等六个市职工参加速成看图学习班的就有六千一百七十一人。对于先进经验的科学解释，也做了不少工作。在科学技术新成就的宣传方面，进行了关于和平利用原子能、半导体等方面的宣传。在自然科学基础知识的宣传方面，举办了数学、物理、化学、地理以及日、月蚀等自然科学基础知识讲座。在劳动保护和卫生知识宣传方面，各地进行了工矿安全、妇幼卫生等宣传。
    在进行上述宣传当中，除了举办讲演宣传外，各地还通过展览、广播、黑板报等方式或出版通俗科学书刊，对职工和他们的家属进行了各种科学技术知识的宣传。在协助企业行政办好业余技术学校和技术训练班方面，组织互教互学方面，也都作了不少的工作。特别是今年1月中华全国总工会和中华全国科学技术普及协会制定并且发布了对职工进行科学技术宣传工作协作计划之后，许多工会和科普协会组织，加强了对职工科普工作的领导和协作，使职工科学技术普及工作有了进一步的开展，并且涌现了大批的积极分子。
    通过开展职工科普工作，开始把科学技术工作者组织起来，逐步地加强了科学技术工作者与生产工人的合作。几年来，厂矿企业的工人和科学技术工作者之间的关系已经有了根本变化，他们之间，已经建立了互助合作的关系。这种互助合作，对于改进生产，革新技术，起了并且起着很大的作用。特别是各地厂矿企业建立科普工作组以后，科学技术工作者的积极性得到了进一步的发挥，进一步加强了科学技术工作者与生产工人的合作和团结。厂矿企业和科学研究机关的合作关系，也在开始建立起来。
    现在，职工科学技术普及工作还不够广泛和深入。工作中也还有形式主义和缺乏计划的现象。这些缺点是必须克服的。
    开展科学技术普及工作，应该是为社会主义建设服务，为生产服务，为群众服务的。因此，在开展这一工作的时候，就必须贯彻结合生产、结合实际、力求广泛的方针。
    结合生产，就是要根据厂矿生产和建设的需要，进行科学技术普及工作。这就要考虑厂矿当前生产的问题，也要考虑生产进一步发展以后将要产生的问题；要考虑职工当前劳动中的问题，也要考虑进一步提高劳动生产率的问题。结合生产，就要求把生产中的问题和先进经验给予科学的分析，把它们提高到科学技术理论上加以解释。这样来进行科学技术普及工作，才可以既帮助生产，又促进科学技术普及工作的发展。
    结合实际，就是要根据厂矿的实际情况和职工的实际需要进行工作。当然，结合生产也是结合实际，不过结合实际却不仅是结合生产。过去许多地方在职工学习国家过渡时期总路线和我国第一个五年计划的时候，及时地进行了社会主义工业化科学知识的宣传，收到很好的效果。职工的要求是多方面的，他们除了生产上的需要以外，还有其他方面的需要。例如，医药卫生知识、关于自然现象的许多知识，都是职工所需要的，都是可以而且应当向职工进行宣传的。我们要善于根据职工各方面的不同要求，来进行科普活动。要作到这样，工会干部和科普会员就需要经常深入群众，了解群众的思想和要求，有计划地通过各种形式来进行科普活动。在进行这一工作的时候，还需要注意职工的实际水平、业余时间和生活习惯等等，要适应这些情况，才能使科学技术普及工作更有效地开展起来。
    根据上述职工科普工作的方针，在科普工作中，应该大力开展生产技术知识的宣传和先进经验的科学解释，同时也要适当地进行自然科学基础知识、卫生常识、安全生产知识等方面的宣传。
    在开展职工科普工作中，应该采取小型多样、通俗易懂和自愿参加的做法。只有采取这些做法，才能使科普工作广泛、深入。
    小型多样，就是要求内容、形式作到多种多样，规模主要是小型的，当然也并不排除大型的。每次讲演，听众可多可少，十几个人可以讲，几十几百个人也可以讲。例如，上海大隆机器厂，三年来结合生产和职工要求，曾经举办过大小科学技术讲座三百零四次，广播科学技术知识一百一十次，平均每年一百三十多次。他们的讲演形式，有系统的讲座，也有专题的讲座；有大型报告会，也有分工种、分车间、分班次和深入科室的小型讲座。每次讲演时间最多两小时，一般是一个小时到一个半小时。有时也利用饭后休息时间（半小时）进行讲演。由于他们采用了小型多样的方式，所以三年来在这个在改造过程中变动很大的工厂里，始终能够坚持进行科学技术讲演活动，从未停过。采用小型多样的方式的好处，就是无论什么时间，什么地方，多少人数，都可以讲，比较能够满足职工的要求；同时也能够给科学技术工作者提供更多的机会，使他们积极地参加科普工作。
    作报告和讲演，要讲得通俗生动，使听众容易懂，才能引起听众对于科学技术的兴趣，吸引群众来学习科学技术。深奥难懂、枯燥无味的讲演报告，是不受群众欢迎的。根据各地的经验，要使报告作到通俗易懂，就不要只谈理论，要尽可能地联系职工所熟悉的实际事物，还要尽量地采用科学影片、幻灯片、模型、仪器、标本、图片等形象化的宣传资料，帮助听众理解报告内容。
    自愿参加，是工会组织和科普协会在开展科普工作中必须贯彻的原则。毛主席教导我们：“凡是需要群众参加的工作，如果没有群众的自觉和自愿，就会流于徒有形式而失败。”科普工作是群众性的宣传教育工作，这一工作只有在群众自觉自愿参加的基础上，才能广泛地开展和起到应有的作用。强迫命令的作法是绝对不能许可的。但是强调自愿参加不能是消极等待，而是应该丰富宣传内容，改进宣传方式，来吸引群众，使他们成为科普活动的积极参加者。

    我国第一个五年计划就要超额完成了。党中央又提出了关于第二个五年计划的建议。毫无疑问，我们的社会主义建设事业愈向前发展，对于职工的科学技术水平的要求必然是愈高的。因此，我们必须把职工的科学技术普及工作，提到重要的地位上来。工会和科普协会必须在全国职工当中，普遍而经常地开展科学技术知识的普及工作，动员、组织并且帮助广大职工学习科学技术知识，提高他们的科学技术水平，来逐步地改变我国工人阶级文化与科学技术水平落后的状况，以加速我国社会主义建设的进程。
    加强科学技术普及工作，首先要切实地加强对于职工科学技术普及工作的组织领导和思想领导。应该指出：由于职工科学技术普及工作还是一项新的工作，在目前的工作中所存在的问题还是很多的。我们必须努力使这些问题得到解决。
    加强对职工科学技术普及工作的领导，中心问题在于总结和推广这一工作中的好的经验。事实证明：推广先进经验，永远是提高工作的重要办法。因此，应该重视我们工作中的经验，认真地总结和推广。这次会议，也正是总结和推广科普工作的先进经验的大会，是科普工作中的先进工作者的大会。
    还必须指出：加强职工科普工作的领导，应该进一步加强职工科普工作的计划性。今年中华全国总工会和中华全国科学技术普及协会联合制订并且发布了对职工进行科普工作的协作计划，对于全国职工科普工作的开展，起了积极的推动作用。因此，除了中华全国总工会和中华全国科学技术普及协会共同作出全国的规划之外，要求各省（自治区）、市、产业工会组织和科普分会、支会组织，根据本地区、本产业的实际情况和职工的需要，作出省、市、产业的规划，制订年度的计划。各市和基层还应该作出更具体的计划。各级工会和科普协会组织需要加强对科普工作计划执行情况的检查工作。当然，计划和要求要实事求是，要适当。在积极地开展职工科学技术普及工作时，必须记住：今天我国职工的劳动还是很繁重的；我们对职工进行的教育，也不只是科学技术普及教育，职工们的学习也是很紧张的；而且有些职工还是半文盲甚至是文盲，对这些文化程度特别低的职工来说，他们最迫切的要求还是识字，因此，只强调科学技术普及不顾其他工作和职工业余时间等条件而提出过高的要求也是不对的，行不通的。
    职工科学技术普及工作，是工会向职工进行共产主义教育的一部分，它必须成为工会宣传部门的一项经常的工作内容。
    第二，必须加强工会与科普协会组织的合作。这是使职工科学技术普及工作顺利开展的重要保证。例如：过去沈阳暖气器材厂的工会组织与科普工作组，没有很好合作，有几次连讲座都办不起来，后来它们加强了合作，科普工作就开展起来了。工会和科普组织在合作当中，也应该有所分工，一般地应该是工会组织的宣传、生产、劳保、女工家属等委员会，研究科普讲题，向科普分支会和科普工作组提出建议，和他们共同制订宣传计划，由工会俱乐部和车间工会组织掌握执行。科普协会和科普工作组应负责动员会员和非会员从事普及工作，帮助讲演员准备讲稿和提高宣传质量。合作问题，现在还不是所有的工会和科普协会组织都完全解决了的问题，还需要我们很好地注意。
    此外，工会和科普协会组织，还必须取得党的领导、企业行政方面的支持和青年团的配合。有了党的领导，才能使我们的工作正确地开展；有了行政在人力、物力等方面的支持和青年团的配合，才能使我们把工作作得更多、更好。
    第三，在开展职工科学技术普及工作中，必须依靠积极分子，充分发挥他们的带头作用、桥梁作用和骨干作用。我们知道，积极分子生活在群众当中，他们与群众有密切的关系，充分发挥积极分子的作用，在科学技术普及工作中同样是非常重要的。工会和科普协会组织都是群众性的组织，这一性质就决定了它只有依靠广大积极分子，才能使科普工作活跃而有生气。但是，要依靠积极分子，就必须加强对积极分子的领导和教育，把他们组织起来，大胆放手，交任务给他们。还要充分发扬民主，有事与他们商量，经常了解他们对工作的意见和要求，帮助他们解决工作中的困难。只有这样，才能充分发挥他们的积极性。
    加强领导，加强合作，广泛地依靠积极分子进行工作，就是目前职工科学技术普及工作中应该特别注意的问题。这些问题是我们改进工作的关键。我们希望各地工会和科普协会组织，总结这方面的经验，把职工的科学技术普及工作广泛地开展起来。

    最后，我想谈谈学习科学技术的态度和方法问题。我们知道，在我们的一切工作特别是生产工作中，是每时每刻都接触到科学技术问题的，因此，在每个工作岗位上都是可以而且应该学习科学技术的。我们希望把大多数职工都吸引到学习中来。在学习中应该抱着虚心的态度，互相帮助、刻苦钻研、坚持到底。掌握科学技术知识，不是容易的事情，但是，只要下定决心，循着由低到高、从浅到深的道路去学，一步一步向前走，就一定可以获得成绩。
    在我们国家里，顽强地学习科学技术知识并且获得重大成就的人是不少的。例如：天津市东亚毛麻厂青年工人李宝林同志，他除在生产工作中和业余学校内努力学习科学技术之外，每天还早起晚歇地自修无线电学、光学、电机应用、数学、物理等课程。因此，他的技术理论水平提高了。在老师傅和技术员的帮助下，他先后改进和创造了“电干测潮器”、“光电比色器”和“光电控制粗纺并条均匀率”的仪器，这都是在纺织工业上具有较高水平的仪器。我国著名的科学家华罗庚教授，过去只在中学读过书，但是他经过刻苦学习，成了一个负有国际声誉的数学家了。他们就是我们的榜样。
    科学工作者和工程技术人员，是我国社会主义建设中的一个重要力量，也是当前职工科学技术知识普及工作中的一支强大队伍。他们在祖国建设中，有了重大的贡献，在向广大职工进行科学技术普及工作当中，也作出了重大的贡献。我们相信，在今后，他们会作出更多更大的贡献来。
    同志们，我们建设社会主义祖国的任务是极其伟大，极其艰巨的。我们要把落后的农业国建设成为一个社会主义工业国，就必须赶上世界先进的科学水平。“只有掌握了最先进的科学，我们才能有巩固的国防，才能有强大的先进的经济力量，才能有充分的条件同苏联和其他人民民主国家在一起，无论在和平的竞赛中或者在敌人所发动的侵略战争中，战胜帝国主义国家”（周恩来：关于知识分子问题的报告）。为了赶上世界先进的科学水平，为了掌握最先进的科学，不只是科学工作者需要加倍努力，广大的职工群众也必须加倍努力，学习科学技术。我们相信，在党和政府的领导和支持下，在有关方面的合作下，在我们大量的科普工作积极分子的努力下，光荣的中国工人阶级在学习文化科学技术方面，也一定能够取得光辉的成就！
