Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 15th. Farmers in the disaster areas of Hebei Province are continuously receiving enthusiastic support from various provinces and cities as they carry out production self-relief.

Since August, most of the sales and supply requests made by Hebei Province to Liaoning, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hubei, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Beijing, Tianjin, Xi'an, and other provinces and cities have been met. According to statistics as of October 2nd, these regions have decided to supply over 100 million jin of broken rice, rice bran, and wheat bran alone, helping to solve the shortage of coarse grains and feed in the disaster areas. In September, five disaster area material purchase and sales liaison groups organized by the relevant departments at the Hebei provincial level went to Beijing, Tianjin, Inner Mongolia, the Northeast, Xi'an and other places to promote the sales of sideline products from the disaster areas and purchase materials needed by the disaster areas. They sold aquatic products, vermicelli, straw bags, and other products with a total value of more than 20 million yuan, and purchased more than 40 million jin of substitute foods. The total value of the purchase and sales tasks completed with Tianjin City alone in two transactions reached 17 million yuan. In order to help the disaster-stricken people in Hebei Province develop sideline occupations such as weaving mats, Liaoning Province decided to allocate 30 million jin of reed. Hohhot City changed its plan to import vermicelli from neighboring provinces and purchased 2 million jin of vermicelli produced in the disaster areas of Hebei Province. Beijing Municipality established a temporary office to support disaster relief in Hebei Province, squeezing out 1,200 kilograms of the most scarce drug "? Aminopyrimidine" and 78 tons of scrap steel to supply to Hebei Province.

    河北省灾区农民
    在生产自救中得到各地支援
    新华社保定15日电　河北省灾区农民，在开展生产自救中，不断得到各省、市的热情支援。
    8月以来，河北省向辽宁、浙江、江西、湖北、内蒙古自治区和北京、天津、西安等省市提出的推销和供应要求，多数得到了满足。据10月2日统计，这些地区仅决定供应的碎大米、谷糠、麸皮就有一亿多斤，帮助解决灾区粗粮、饲料的不足。9月份，河北省级有关部门统一组织的五个灾区物资购销联络组，分赴北京、天津、内蒙古、东北、西安等地推销灾区副业产品和采购灾区所需物资，共推销出水产、粉条、草袋等产品总值二千万余元，采购代食品四千多万斤。仅和天津市两次成交的购销任务，总值即达一千七百万元。辽宁省为了照顾河北省灾民开展织席副业，决定拨给三千万斤席苇。呼和浩特市改变了从邻省调入粉条的计划，收购河北省灾区生产的粉条二百万斤。北京市为支援河北省救灾，成立了临时办公室，把目前最缺乏的药品“?胺嘧啶”挤出一千二百公斤和废钢材七十八吨供给河北省。
