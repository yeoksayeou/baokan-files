Xinhua News Agency Report: The Communist Party committees at all levels in Yan'an Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, are beginning to strengthen the organizational construction of agricultural production cooperatives through the work of rectifying agricultural cooperatives.

This prefecture has already achieved advanced cooperativization, with member households accounting for 91% of the total number of households in the prefecture. Before July, each county planned to merge the existing 3,946 cooperatives into 1,500 to 2,000 large cooperatives by the end of the year. Later, after investigation by cadres dispatched by the Yan'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party, it was found that large cooperatives had more problems and chaotic management, especially since farmers in mountainous areas lived scattered. Merging them into large cooperatives would definitely bring many difficulties to production and management. For this reason, the Prefectural Committee decided to start rectifying and improving the organizational structure of agricultural cooperatives from August.

After more than two months of rectification work, 2,330 cooperatives in the prefecture have appropriately adjusted their labor organization, implemented a labor quota management system, and improved the management level of the cooperatives. At the same time, each county, for agricultural cooperatives in remote areas where members lived too scattered, arranged production based on local production conditions and field operation needs, using small production teams as units, giving the teams the convenience of independent activities. Agricultural cooperatives that are close to each other and have the conditions for merging are creating conditions for merging cooperatives. For example, establishing joint cooperative committees, where joint cooperative committees exchange experiences and provide unified guidance, to gradually transition to merging cooperatives. A total of 621 joint cooperative committees have been established in the prefecture, with 2,775 cooperatives participating in the joint cooperative committees.

In the process of this cooperative rectification, various places also conducted democratic cooperative management education for members by handling specific issues in the cooperatives. Huangling, Yijun, and Wuqi counties also inspected the supervisory work of agricultural cooperatives and improved the supervisory system. The Communist Party branches in each cooperative, after review and education, admitted outstanding individuals who emerged in production this year into the Party, strengthening the core organization of the agricultural cooperatives.

    通过整社加强农业社组织建设
    延安专区各县调整社的规模和劳动组织
    据新华社讯　陕西省延安专区的中共各级党委，通过整顿农业生产合作社工作，开始加强农业社的组织建设。
    这个专区已经高级合作化，入社农户占全专区农户总数91％。7月以前，各县计划在年底前把现有的三千九百四十六个社，合并为一千五百至二千个大社。后来经中共延安地委会派出的干部调查结果，发现大社问题较多，经营管理较乱，特别是由于山区农民居住分散，并成大社一定会给生产和经营管理带来很多困难。为此，地委决定从8月份起，开始整顿和健全农业社的组织机构。
    经过两个多月的整顿工作，全专区有二千三百三十个社适当的调整了劳动组织，实行劳动定额管理制度，改进和提高了社的管理水平。同时各县对偏僻地区社员居住过于分散的农业社，根据当地生产条件和田间作业的需要，以小型的生产队为单位，安排生产，给予队以独立活动的方便。对于距离较近有条件合并的农业社正在为并社创造条件。例如成立联社委员会，由联社委员会交流经验，统一指导，以便逐渐向并社过渡。全专区已经成立六百二十一个联社委员会，参加联社委员会的有二千七百七十五个社。
    在这次整社过程中，各地还通过处理社里的具体问题，向社员进行民主办社教育。黄陵、宜君和吴旗等县还检查了农业社的监察工作，健全了监察制度。各社中共支部对今年在生产中涌现的积极分子，经过审查教育，吸收入党，壮大了农业社的核心组织。
