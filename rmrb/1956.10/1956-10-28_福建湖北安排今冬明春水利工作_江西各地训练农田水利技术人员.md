Xinhua News Agency report: The Fujian Provincial Water Conservancy Conference, which closed on the 22nd, decided to launch a mass movement to build agricultural irrigation projects this winter and next spring. The goal is to increase the irrigated area by 1.45 million mu and improve the irrigation area by 1.33 million mu next year, further reducing the number of drought-prone fields in the province. The conference also made arrangements for flood prevention work in the coastal areas, drainage work in mountainous farmland, soil and water conservation work in areas with severe soil erosion, and the repair of water conservancy projects damaged by the three floods and high tides in September.

The conference believes that small-scale water conservancy projects require less money, produce quick results, and are technically simple. Relying on the manpower and resources of agricultural cooperatives and the trained, original farmer water conservancy technicians, the projects can be carried out. The conference decided that Fujian should focus on mobilizing the masses to build small-scale water conservancy projects and universally promote water storage and irrigation in agricultural irrigation work. The conference learned from the lessons of the water conservancy construction movement last winter and this spring, namely that some areas were delayed in their preparations and started work late, resulting in some projects not being completed in time before the rainy season, and some projects mobilizing a large number of laborers to complete them in a rush, affecting the normal activities of local agriculture and sideline production. Therefore, the current water conservancy construction movement should "seize winter repairs and shorten spring repairs" so as not to hinder next year's spring plowing and farmers' sideline production activities. The conference requested that water conservancy departments at all levels complete various preparations as soon as possible and strive to launch a mass water conservancy construction movement immediately after the autumn harvest.

Xinhua News Agency report: The Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Conference concluded on the 22nd. The conference specifically arranged the water conservancy work for this winter and next spring.

This winter and next spring, Hubei Province will continue to strengthen the flood resistance capacity of the main dikes of the Yangtze and Han Rivers, eliminate the hidden dangers of these dikes, focus on raising and thickening them, and improving the quality of the dikes. The dikes on both sides of the Dongjing River and the Yunshui River will also be repaired to enable them to defend against floods as large as those in 1954. In areas with suitable conditions, people will also adjust civil dikes and embankments in a planned way, striving to avoid breaches and disasters under normal circumstances, and vigorously carry out drainage and irrigation facilities in the lake and swamp areas.

Hubei Province plans to increase the irrigated area by more than 2.7 million mu and improve the irrigated area by more than 6.9 million mu by 1957. In addition to continuing to strengthen soil and water conservation work in the original 6,000 square kilometers of area, it is necessary to increase the area controlled for soil and water loss by 5,000 square kilometers by 1957.

The dikes along the Yangtze and Han Rivers, extending for more than 2,000 kilometers, have been repaired in the past year, and 80% of the dike sections have reached or exceeded the highest flood level of 1954. Among them, the Jingjiang Dike, the Wuhan River Dike, the Huangshi River Dike, the Bapu Dike, and the Han River main dike have all exceeded the highest flood level of 1954 by more than one meter. Last winter and this spring, Hubei Province built and repaired more than 580,000 small ponds and dams, and built more than 1,900 small reservoirs with a benefit of more than 100 mu, exceeding the total number of small reservoirs built in the province since liberation, making about 70% of the province's farmland able to ensure a good harvest.

Xinhua News Agency report: The agricultural irrigation technical personnel training courses held by the Jiangxi Provincial Water Conservancy Department and various special districts and counties have all started. A total of more than 8,000 people are participating in the training, which is close to the total number of technical personnel trained in the province since liberation. This is a measure taken by Jiangxi Province this year to strengthen winter agricultural irrigation construction and improve the poor engineering quality caused by the weak technical guidance of this part of the project in the past.

This training is organized according to the needs of different projects such as large and small reservoirs, canals, and general ponds and dams to be built in the province this winter. In the past, the number of technical personnel for medium and small-sized reservoirs and canal projects was small and the level was low, which is the focus of this training work. About 200 in-service cadres and young students with high and junior high school education are now studying surveying, measurement, design and other courses for reservoirs and canal projects in provincial training courses, preparing to serve as technical guidance for agricultural irrigation institutions in various counties and survey, design, and construction of larger small reservoirs and canals this winter. The 800 trainees participating in the training courses of the special commissioner's office will be responsible for the survey, design and construction of small reservoirs and canals after graduation. The rest of the trainees in the county training courses are all selected rural cadres and agricultural cooperative members with certain water conservancy work experience. After learning general engineering technical knowledge, they will return to their original places to establish a water conservancy technical guidance network and guide farmers to build general small water conservancy projects such as ponds and dams on the spot.

### 福建湖北安排今冬明春水利工作  江西各地训练农田水利技术人员

    福建湖北安排今冬明春水利工作
    江西各地训练农田水利技术人员
    据新华社讯　22日闭幕的福建省水利会议上，确定在今冬明春开展群众性兴修农田水利运动，做到明年增加灌溉面积一百四十五万亩，改善灌溉面积一百三十三万亩，使全省容易受旱的田亩数进一步缩小。会议对各沿江地区的防洫防涝工作、山区农田的排水工作、水土流失严重地区的水土保持工作以及被9月间三次洪水，大潮冲毁的水利工程的修复工作等，都作了安排。
    会议认为，小型水利花钱少、见效快、技术简单，依靠农业社的人力、物力和经过训练的民间原有的农民水利技术人员，就可把工程办起来。会议决定福建在农田水利工作上应以发动群众兴办小型水利为主，普遍推行蓄水灌溉。会议吸取去冬今春兴修水利运动中的教训，即有些地区因准备工作做得迟、开工较晚，造成有的工程不能及时在雨季来到前完工，有的工程虽然动员了大批劳力用突击方法争取及时完工，但影响了当地农业和副业生产的正常活动。因此，对这次兴修水利运动要“抓紧冬修缩短春修”不要妨碍到明年春耕工作和农民副业生产活动。会议要求各级水利部门要尽速完成各种准备工作争取秋收一结束，立即开展群众性兴修水利运动。
    据新华社讯　湖北省水利会议在22日结束。会上具体安排了今冬明春的水利工作。
    今冬明春，湖北省将继续加强江、汉干堤的抗洪能力，消灭这些堤防的隐患，重点加高培厚，改善堤质。东荆河、溳水等两岸的堤防，也将加以培修，使其能够防御1954年那样大的洪水。在有条件的地区，还将有计划的调整民堤民垸，力争在一般情况下不致溃口成灾，并且大力进行开渠排水和整理湖沼地区的灌溉设施。
    湖北省计划到1957年增加灌溉面积二百七十多万亩，改善灌溉面积六百九十多万亩。各地除在原有的六千平方公里地区，继续加强水土保持工作外，到1957年还需增加控制水土流失面积五千平方公里。
    长江、汉水两岸绵延二千多公里的堤防，在过去一年内，经过整修后，已有80％的堤段达到或超过了1954年最高洪水位，其中荆江大堤、武汉市江堤、黄石市江堤、巴铺大堤以及汉水干堤，都已超过了1954年最高洪水位一公尺多。去冬今春，湖北省新建和整修的小型塘坝工程五十八万多处，新建受益百亩以上的小型水库一千九百多座，超过了这个省解放以来兴修的小型水库的总和，使全省约有70％左右的农田能够保收。
    据新华社讯　江西省水利厅和各专、县分别举办的农田水利技术人员训练班已全部开课。参加受训的人员共有八千多人，接近解放几年来全省已训练的技术人员的总和。这是今年江西省为加强冬季兴修农田水利、改进过去因对这部分工程技术指导薄弱造成的工程质量不高而采取的措施。
    这次训练是按照今冬在全省兴修较大型的和小型的水库、渠道和一般塘坝等不同工程的需要组织的。过去中、小型水库和渠道工程的技术力量人数少、水平低，是这次训练工作的重点。约二百名具有高、初中文化程度的在职干部和青年学生现在正在省级训练班学习水库、渠道工程的勘查、测量、设计等课程，准备在今冬担任各县农田水利机构的技术指导工作和较大的小型水库、渠道的勘查、设计、施工。参加各专署训练班的八百名学员，结业后将担任小型水库和渠道的勘查、设计和施工。其余各县训练班的学员都是挑选的具有一定水利工作经验的乡村干部和农业社社员，在学习一般工程技术常识后仍回原地，建立水利技术指导网，就地指导农民兴修塘坝等一般小型水利。
