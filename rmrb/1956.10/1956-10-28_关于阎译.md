Regarding Yan's Translation

Jiang Shaoyuan

Yan Jianbi’s short essay published on page 8 of the People's Daily on September 15th aims to appeal to certain "senior members," "leaders," and "Party members" in various "organizations" not to prevent other members and "non-Party members" from speaking and managing affairs. – Don't blame them for "speaking out of righteousness" and "acting bravely" by accusing them of "talking nonsense" and "meddling in other people's business." – Don't "fix" them just because they are willing to speak and manage affairs.

This short article begins by translating "a story" from the ancient book "Strategies of the Warring States" (Strategies of Wei) into modern Chinese. I have some opinions on the handling of this story and cannot help but copy the original text of Strategies of Wei and its modern translation below, along with a few explanations.

A man of Wei welcomed a new bride. The bride got into the carriage. She asked, "Whose horses are the outer horses?" The driver said, "They are borrowed." The bride said to the servant, "Treat the outer horses well and do not whip the shaft horses!" When the carriage arrived at the door, she was helped down, and she instructed the accompanying woman: "Extinguish the stove! It will catch fire!" Upon entering the room and seeing the mortar, she said, "Move it under the window, it obstructs passersby!" The host laughed at her. – These three statements are all important; however, the reason she was laughed at was because she spoke at the wrong time!

A man from the State of Wei was marrying a new daughter-in-law. As soon as the new bride got into the wedding carriage, she asked the driver: "Hey! Whose are the horses harnessed to the outer sides of the yoke?" The driver replied, "They're borrowed." The new bride then said to the carter, "Take good care of those outside horses that belong to other people. Don't you dare whip our own cart horses, you hear?" As soon as the cart arrived at her husband's front gate, the wedding party helped her alight from the cart; the moment that her feet touched the ground, she instructed the accompanying attendant: "Remember now! Be sure to extinguish the fire in the hearth when you go back; or it'll catch fire if it's left unattended! Ah?! Be extra careful now, mind you!" As soon as she entered the courtyard, and noticed the rice mortar placed right in the way, she turned back to the attendant and warned: "Move that to the base of the wall underneath the window-ledge; it's in the way of people passing by!" The groom's family members, upon hearing and seeing her antics, secretly chortled at her. - Why did they laugh at her? They thought she was a strange one, not like any typical new bride. It seemed to them that, as soon as she came, she just butted in with her meddling, as if she could tell everyone what to do! The person who recorded this story commented:

Her three pronouncements were all very correct and proper; still, she could not avoid being snickered at, because her words were ill-timed, too early, since she was a new bride!

Regarding this story, I remember pointing out four points many years ago: (1) It first appeared in a certain chapter of "Lüshi Chunqiu" ("The Annals of Lü Buwei"), and the version in Lüshi Chunqiu is older; in that older version, the mortar was not a movable mortar but a fixed mortar built on the ground. (2) The stove was probably also not a portable stove but a fixed stove built on the ground. (3) When the new bride enters the door, the stove fire is very strong, and she probably needs to step over the fire to ward off evil, so this is a program in the ancient wedding ceremony. (4) She probably needs to approach the mortar, step on the pestle with her feet a few times, or hold the pestle and pound it a few times with her hands, to show that she is responsible for using the family mortar from now on, so this is another program in the ancient wedding ceremony.

Regarding ground mortars and ground stoves, I wrote a series of short articles many years ago and published them in a Beijing publication (the monthly magazine of the Sino-French University?) several years after Zhang Yi, director of the Philosophy Department of the Faculty of Arts of Peking University, etc., rudely canceled the course "Study of Ritual Customs and Superstitions" that I was teaching. At the time when this course was canceled, I angrily refused to teach even the "History of Religion" that they allowed me to continue teaching: it was as if a new bride, after being laughed at, blocked, and "fixed" by her mothers-in-law, said "I'm not marrying anymore" and ran away!

Understanding that both the mortar and the stove are related to the wedding ceremony makes it even clearer that the new bride's instructions to extinguish the stove and move the mortar are very natural—they are saying things worth saying, not talking nonsense; they are managing necessary things that should be managed, not meddling in other people's business. This ancient folk story is indeed wonderful!

Therefore, I hope that newspapers and authors can improve the handling of the modern translation of ancient books and ancient folk stories as much as possible.

    关于阎译
    江绍原
    9月15日人民日报第八版所载阎简弼小品文，目的在呼吁各“机关中的某些资格老的成员”，“领导人”和“党团员”不要阻拦其他的成员和“非党团人士”说话、管事，——不要因为他们“仗义执言”，“见义勇为”，反而怪他们“乱说话”，“管闲事”——不要因为他们肯说话、肯管事，反而“整”他们一通。
    这篇短文却是把古籍“战国策”（卫策）中“一个故事”译成今文开头的。我对于这个故事的处理有些意见，止不住把卫策原文和它的今译抄写于下，并且解说几句。
    卫人迎新妇。妇上车。问：“骖马，谁马也？”御曰：“借之。”新妇谓仆曰：“拊骖，无笞服！”车至门，扶，教送毋（母）：“灭灶！将失火！”入室见臼，曰：“徙之牖下，妨往来者！”主人笑之。——此三言者皆要言也；然而不免为笑者，蚤晚之时失也！
    卫国的一个人娶新媳妇儿。这个新娘子上了花车就问赶车的：“喴！边辕上套的马是谁的呀？”赶车的回答说：
  “那是借来的。”新娘子就对这个赶车的家员说“好好地看承人家那边辕的马，也别鞭打咱那驾辕的牲口！啊，听见了吗？”车子一到丈夫家的门口儿，人们将她搀扶了下来；脚刚着地，她就告诉陪送她来的伴姆说：“记着！您一会儿可去把那灶膛里的火熄灭掉；不看着了火！啊？！千万当心点儿，记着！”一进院子，瞧见当道儿摆着一个捣米臼，她又回头叮嘱伴姆说：“把它搬到窗根儿底下去，它在这儿妨碍来往走路的人！”婆家的人看了和听了她这些言动，都暗暗地笑话她。——为啥笑话她呐？笑她不像个一般所常见的新娘子。觉着她：怎么新来乍到，就这么爱说话、爱管闲事？！记载这段故事的人发表议论说：
    她这三次发言，说的都是正经八倍的大好话；可是，不免被暗地里讥笑，那是她说话的时间不合适，未免早了些，因为她是个新来乍到的新媳妇哇！
    关于这个故事，我记得自己在多年前指出过四点：（一）它先已见于“吕氏春秋”某篇，而且吕氏春秋的说法较古；在那个较古的说法中，臼还不是可以“徙”（挪动）的行臼而是就地筑成的地臼。（二）灶想必也还不是可以搬来搬去的火炉（行灶）而是就地筑成的地灶。（三）新妇入门时，灶火正很旺盛，而且想必要她从火上跨过去以禳邪，所以这是古代婚礼中的一个节目。（四）臼想必也要她走近，而且用脚把杵踏几下，或用手抱杵捣几下，以示她从今以后负有使用家臼的妇职，所以这又是古代婚礼里的一个节目。
    关于地臼、地灶，多年前我写过一组短文，发表在北京某刊物（中法大学月刊？） 上，事在北京大学文学院哲学系主任张颐等把我担任讲的“礼俗迷信研究”一门功课粗暴地取消以后好几年。在这门功课被取消的当时，我愤而连他们允许我续教的“宗教史”也拒绝不教了：这好像一名新妇被婆婆们一笑，一挡、一“整”，她说声“我不嫁了”，便溜之大吉！
    明白了臼与灶均有关婚仪，便更可以知道新妇嘱咐人灭灶和徙臼是很自然的——是说值得一说的话而不是乱说话，是管有一管的必要的事而不是管闲事。这个古代民间故事，的确很妙呢！
    因而，报纸和作者对于古籍的今译和古代民间故事的处理，希望尽可能提高一步。
