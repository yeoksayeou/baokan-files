It's Not a Good Way to Record Subsidiary Labor by Money
　　Hui Zhi
    The content of sideline production is rich and diverse, and there are also many types of remuneration methods for sideline labor. The sideline remuneration methods currently implemented in various places can be summarized into several types, such as three guarantees and one reward, piecework, fixed base points, and recording points by money.
    Three guarantees and one reward. This means guaranteeing work, guaranteeing output, guaranteeing costs, and rewarding overproduction. This method is used for items such as animal husbandry and orchards. Tian Shuangfeng, a member of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Fenghuang County, Hunan Province, was contracted to feed seven one-month-old piglets for the cooperative. The cooperative gave her 10.5 yuan for the cost of each piglet, which she used to purchase feed at the market herself. The feed was also converted into cash and given to her. After ten months, each pig was to be delivered with 100 jin of meat, totaling 105 workdays. The characteristics of this type of sideline business are that the operating time is long, the business is relatively simple, but it requires frequent management. If the labor remuneration is calculated on a daily basis for each task, it is neither convenient nor accurate. The method of contracting is simpler and also conforms to the principle of distribution according to work. In addition, some cooperatives guarantee work and output but not costs, or reward but not overproduction. This method also has certain advantages, but it cannot fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the members.
    Piecework. This method is generally adopted for jobs with many types of work, large cooperative relationships, and products with fixed quality and quantity that can be calculated by the piece. Among them, it is further divided into individual piecework and collective piecework, and individual scoring according to different situations. For example, bamboo craftsmen in the Bucun Agricultural Cooperative in Suichuan, Jiangxi, adopt an individual piecework system, recording 10 points for repairing sun-drying mats using twelve bamboo strips, and 25 points for making a new one. Alum boiling is collective piecework and individual scoring, with six people per tank, totaling 135 points, and each person then evaluates their own work points based on labor and skills. This method can not only stimulate production enthusiasm but also specifically implement the production responsibility system.
    Fixed base points. The Huangzhou Agricultural Cooperative in Anyi, Jiangxi, stipulates that five people plant eleven mu of vegetables, and each person has fixed base points, calculated on a daily basis, and deductions are made for missed work. Fixed base points cannot encourage the production enthusiasm of members, and the added deduction further damages the enthusiasm of members. Although this method is simple and easy to implement, it is detrimental to production.
    Recording points by money. The income of members from sideline businesses is handed over to the cooperative, and the cooperative records work points for the members according to the standard of agricultural planned income. This method is generally used for sideline businesses without fixed income, such as fishing and portering. This method has many shortcomings. First, it easily causes confusion among members and creates contradictions between agriculture and sideline businesses. When sideline income is high, members rush to do it; when income is low, even if there is surplus labor, no one wants to do it. Second, it is difficult to balance the labor remuneration between agriculture and sideline businesses. Because sideline income is fixed, agricultural income can only be determined after the autumn harvest. Now, using agricultural planned income as the standard for recording points, if agricultural production is reduced after the autumn harvest, those engaged in sideline businesses will suffer; if production is increased, those engaged in agriculture will complain. This method is essentially a kind of buying and selling of work points, and it is difficult to ensure that both parties do not suffer losses. Third, there are many avenues for sideline production, and income varies greatly. If points are recorded according to the amount of money earned, the remuneration for people engaged in the same sideline labor will also be unbalanced. The Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Huangpi County, Hubei Province, sent two members to do odd jobs. Their daily income at the oil factory was 1.5 yuan, recording 1.2 workdays, and their daily income at the rice factory was 1.2 yuan, recording 1 workday. They have the same level of skill, and neither is more hardworking than the other, but there is a difference of 0.2 points.
    In some other places, sideline income is handed over to the cooperative and recorded as money but not points, and then converted into work points for distribution after the autumn harvest according to the value of agricultural distribution. On the surface, this seems more reasonable, but in reality, the remuneration for sideline labor still changes with the actual value of agricultural workdays, and the contradiction still exists. For example, the above-mentioned member who did odd jobs in the oil factory handed over 1.5 yuan to the cooperative every day. If agricultural production is reduced after the autumn harvest and the value of each workday is only 1 yuan, then the remuneration for this member's one day of labor is equivalent to one and a half days of labor for a member engaged in agriculture. If agricultural production is increased after the autumn harvest and the value of each workday increases to 3 yuan, then the remuneration for this member's one day of labor is only equivalent to half a day of labor for a member engaged in agriculture. Therefore, no matter how the points are recorded by money, it is always difficult to achieve mutual benefit and difficult to implement the principle of distribution according to work.
    How can the problem be solved? I believe that when agricultural cooperatives plan sideline production, they must first delineate the scope of individual operation and collective operation, and distinguish which collective operation is appropriate and which individual operation is beneficial. All collective operations with large-scale investment should be operated uniformly by the cooperative. Such as kiln industry, workshops, transportation, large-scale breeding industry, etc. Under the premise of not affecting collective production, all production that is suitable for individual operation, small in scale, small in investment, or without investment, and suitable for semi-labor and auxiliary labor operation, such as sporadic breeding, small handicrafts, weaving, mounting crafts, digging medicinal materials, picking camellia, etc., can be assigned to members for individual operation as much as possible. The characteristics of these productions are that they are scattered, sporadic, unformed, inconvenient to set quotas, and difficult to calculate costs. Giving them to members for individual operation, and the income also belongs to individuals, is convenient for members and can reduce some of the troubles in calculating remuneration, which is not detrimental to the development of production.
    Will this form individual farming? No, it won't. Because sideline business is subordinate to agriculture, and agricultural and sideline businesses are still planned and led by the cooperative in a unified manner. Under the condition that collective production is not hindered, members engaging in private sideline businesses is beneficial to both the cooperative and the members. As for the handcraftsmen who go out to work, although the income belongs to themselves, they are still members of the agricultural cooperative, and their families still participate in the labor within the cooperative. The cooperative distributes grain and money to them according to their labor work points; their own income can be voluntarily invested in the cooperative. In this way, their relationship with the cooperative is still closely linked, and there is no need to force them to hand in money and mechanically emphasize unity.
    For the remuneration of collectively operated sideline businesses, the methods of contracting or piecework should be adopted as much as possible. In fact, many sideline productions can use these two methods. Some people who are afraid of trouble emphasize that the method of recording points by money is simpler and easier for farmers to accept. In fact, this is a lazy method that only cares about the present and does not consider the consequences. Doing so may save some trouble at the time; after the problem occurs, it will be much more troublesome. Some people also say that handing over money to the cooperative can solve the problem of insufficient funds and pocket money for other members in the cooperative. From this point of view, it is difficult to guarantee the fairness and reasonableness of labor remuneration, and it is easy to harm the enthusiasm of members in operating sideline businesses. If you encounter some temporary odd jobs that cannot be contracted or pieceworked, what should you do? You can temporarily evaluate it based on various conditions such as time and labor, and strive to use the methods of fixed base points and recording points by money as little as possible, and try to meet the principles of mutual benefit and distribution according to work.

　　副业劳动按钱记分不是好办法
　　慧之
    副业生产的内容是丰富多样的，副业劳动的计酬方法也是种类繁多的。目前各地实行的副业计酬办法，归纳起来，大约有三包一奖、按件记工、固定底分和按钱记分等几种。
    三包一奖。就是包工包产包成本，超产奖励。采用这种办法的有牧养、果园等项。湖南凤凰县先锋农业社的社员田双凤，包喂社里七口满月小猪，社里发给她每口小猪的成本十元五角钱，由她自己到街上选购，饲料也折成现款包给她，十个月后，每口猪交肉一百斤，共记一百零五个劳动日。这类副业的特点是经营时间较长，业务比较简单，但需要经常管理。如果按每天每项工作去计算劳动报酬，既不方便，也不易准确，采用包的办法比较简便，也符合按劳取酬的原则。另有些社包工包产不包成本，或者超产不奖励，这办法也有一定好处，但不能充分发挥社员的积极性。
    按件记工。凡是工种多、协作关系大、产品有固定质量和数量能以件计算的，一般都采用这种办法。其中又根据不同情况分为个人计件和集体计件、个人评分两类。如江西遂川卜村农业社的篾工，就是采取个人计件制，修补晒簟使用十二只篾子记十分，新打一床记二十五分。熬硝就是集体计件、个人评分，每槽六人，共记一百三十五分，各人再根据劳动和技术评定自己工分。这种办法既可以刺激生产积极性，又能具体贯彻生产责任制。
    固定底分。江西安义黄州农业社规定五个人种十一亩菜，每人都固定了底分，按日计算，误工倒扣。固定底分本来就不能鼓舞社员的生产热情，再加倒扣，更损伤了社员的积极性。这种办法虽然简单易行，但对生产不利。
    按钱记分。社员经营副业的收入交给社里，社里根据农业计划收入的标准给社员记上工分。一般没有固定收入的副业如捕鱼、挑脚等，都采用这种办法。这种办法缺点很多。第一，容易在社员中引起纷乱，造成农副业间的矛盾。副业收入多的时候，社员们便抢着干，收入少的时候，虽有剩余劳力也没人愿搞。第二，农副业的劳动报酬不易平衡。因为副业收入是固定的，农业收入要到秋后才能肯定，现在以农业计划收入为标准来记分，如果秋后农业减产，搞副业的人就要吃亏；增产了，搞农业的人又要叫苦。这种办法实质上带有买卖工分的性质，很难做到双方互不吃亏。第三，副业生产门路很多，收入悬殊，要是按照收入钱的多少记分，同样从事副业劳动的人，报酬也会不平衡。湖北黄陂县星火农业社派出做零工的两个社员，在油厂的每天收入一元五角，记一点二个劳动日，在米厂的每天收入一元二角，记一个劳动日。同样没有技术，谁也不比谁辛苦些，但却差了两分。
    另有些地方副业收入交社记钱不记分，到秋后按农业分值折工分配。从表面上看来这样做好像合理些，实际上副业劳动报酬还是随着农业劳动日实际价值的变化而变化，矛盾依然存在。比如上述在油厂做零工的社员，每天交给社里一元五角钱，到秋后如果农业减产了，每个劳动日的价值只有一元，那么这个打零工的社员劳动一天的报酬，就抵上搞农业的社员劳动了一天半。如果秋后农业增产了，每个劳动日的价值增加到了三元，那么这个打零工社员劳动一天的报酬，只抵得上搞农业的社员的半天劳动。因此，按钱记分不管记法如何，总是不容易做到双方互利，难于实现按劳取酬的原则。
    问题怎样解决呢？我认为农业社在规划副业生产时，首先要划清个人经营和集体经营的范围，区别哪些集体经营合适，哪些个人经营有利？凡属集体操作、规模投资较大的，应该由社统一经营。如窑业、作坊、运输、大型饲养业等等。在不影响集体生产的前提下，凡属宜于单独操作、规模小、投资少或不用投资，适合半劳力和辅助劳力经营的生产，如零星饲养、小手工业、编织、裱糊工艺、挖药材、采山茶等，都可以尽量划归社员个人经营。这些生产的特点是分散零星，不定型，不便定额，难计成本。给社员个人经营，收入也归个人所有，既便利社员，又可减少一些计算报酬中的麻烦，对发展生产并无不利之处。
    这样做会不会形成单干呢？不会的。因为副业是服从农业的，农副业还是由社统一规划和领导的，在不妨碍集体生产的情况下，社员搞点私人副业，对社对社员都是有利无弊的。至于出外做工的手工业者，虽然收入归自己，但他仍是农业社的成员之一，他的家属仍然参加社内劳动，社内按他们的劳动工分分粮款给他们；他本人的收入，可以自愿向社投资。这样，他们和社的关系还是血肉相连的，不必硬要他交钱，机械强调统一。
    集体经营的副业计酬，应尽量采用包工或者计件的办法。其实有很多副业生产都是可以用这两种办法的。有些怕麻烦的人强调说：按钱记分的办法简单些，农民容易接受。实际上这是只顾眼前不看后果的懒办法。这样做在当时可能要省点事；问题发生后，那可就费事多了。也有人说：交钱给社里，可以解决社内资金和其他社员零用钱不足的问题。从这个观点着眼，就很难保证劳动报酬的公平合理，很容易伤害社员经营副业的积极性。如果遇到一些真正既不能包工又不便计件的临时杂活，怎么办？可以根据时间、劳力等各种条件临时评定一下，力求少用固定底分和按钱记分的办法，尽量做到符合互利和按劳取酬的原则。
