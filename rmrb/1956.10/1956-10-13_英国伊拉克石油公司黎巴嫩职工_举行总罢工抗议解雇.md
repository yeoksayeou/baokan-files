Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 12th Dispatch from Tass: Newspaper reports say that employees of the British Iraqi Petroleum Company and the Tripoli Oil Refinery began a general strike on October 12th to protest the company's large-scale layoffs of Lebanese employees in order to exert pressure on the Lebanese government.

It has been previously reported that the Iraqi Petroleum Company recently announced the dismissal of one hundred and twenty Lebanese employees in the company's enterprises in Tripoli, Lebanon.

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 11th Dispatch from Tass: The Lebanese cabinet held a meeting on the evening of October 10th to discuss the issue of the Lebanese employees dismissed by the Iraqi Petroleum Company.

The "Telegraph" reported that the government has decided to guarantee subsidies to those employees who have already been dismissed and those who may be dismissed in the future until their work is arranged.

The newspaper also said that its editorial department has received many petitions from various Lebanese trade unions and political groups, expressing full support for the Lebanese government's attitude towards the Iraqi Petroleum Company. The Lebanese government recently decided to fine the Iraqi Petroleum Company for fabricating profit income figures.

The Tripoli Dockworkers' Union, the Stevedores' Union, and the Railway Workers' Union wrote in the petition: The Iraqi Petroleum Company is attempting to create chaos in Lebanon, divert Lebanese public attention from the Suez Canal issue, and exert pressure on the Lebanese government. We fully support the government's actions to defend Lebanon's legitimate rights.
