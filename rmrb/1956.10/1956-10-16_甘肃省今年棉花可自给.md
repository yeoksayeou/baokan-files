Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 12th. Most cotton-producing areas in Gansu Province have had a bumper cotton harvest. The total cotton output of the province is estimated to reach more than 350,000 dan (raw cotton, same below), and the amount purchased can exceed the amount supplied, thus becoming a self-sufficient province in cotton.

Many areas in Gansu Province are suitable for cotton planting, but in the past, very little was planted, and almost all the cotton needed relied on supplies from other provinces. In recent years, the cotton planting area in the province has been expanding year by year. This year, the province's cotton planting area is more than 540,000 mu, an increase of about 100% over last year; the average cotton yield per mu has also increased significantly. The 75,300 mu of cotton planted in Dunhuang County this year can produce an average of about 102 jin per mu.

    甘肃省今年棉花可自给
    新华社兰州12日电　甘肃省大部产棉区棉花丰收。全省棉花总产量估计可以达到三十五万多担（皮棉，下同），收购量可以超过供应量，从而变成了一个棉花自给的省份。
    甘肃省很多地区适宜植棉，但是过去种得很少，需用的棉花几乎全部依靠外省供应。近几年来，省内植棉面积逐年扩大。今年全省棉花播种面积五十四万多亩，比去年增加一倍左右；每亩棉花平均产量也有显著提高。敦煌县今年播种的七万五千三百多亩棉花，平均每亩约可产一百零二斤。
