Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 27th: The more than 5,000 mu of coffee, kapok, lemongrass, and other tropical cash crops planted in Guangxi Province this year are all growing well.

	The Yunnan Kaili peeled-seed kapok, directly sown by the state-owned Daxin Kapok Farm in March, has grown to three chi (one meter) high, and is generally budding and forming bolls. The best plants have about 100 buds, while the average has 20 to 30. These kapok trees began to produce flowers at the end of August.

	The survival rate of coffee saplings planted this spring is over 90%. Some of the coffee trees planted last spring have already borne fruit.

	Guangxi Province currently has a total of 28 state-owned farms and reclamation farms cultivating tropical and subtropical crops. They are cultivating coffee seedlings to prepare for large-scale planting next year.

    广西热带作物生长良好
    据新华社南宁27日电　广西省今年种植的五千多亩咖啡、洚岛棉、香茅等热带经济作物都长得很好。
    国营大新洚岛棉农场3月间直播的云南开远离核木棉，已长到三尺高，普遍现蕾、结铃。最好的每株现蕾一百个左右，一般的也有二、三十个。这些木棉在8月底就已经开始收花。
    今春栽种的咖啡树苗成活率达90％以上。去年春季栽种的咖啡树已有一部分结实。
    广西省现有培植热带亚热带作物的国营农场、垦殖场共二十八个，他们正在播育咖啡苗，为明年大量种植作准备。
