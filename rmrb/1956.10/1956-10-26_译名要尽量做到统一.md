    Translations Should Strive for Consistency

    On October 20th, your newspaper's seventh page published two pieces of news about the Soviet Union's commemoration of Lu Xun. The first mentioned a "Baoziniyewa," while the second mentioned another "Professor Bozideiyewa." People unfamiliar with the situation or those who do not understand Russian would certainly assume these were two different people. In fact, Baoziniyewa and Bozideiyewa are the same person, just two different translations. It is suggested that news agencies and newspapers consider the convenience of readers and pay as much attention as possible to the consistency of translations.

    译名要尽量做到统一
    10月20日你报七版登了两则关于苏联纪念鲁迅的消息。在前一则中提到一位“鲍兹尼耶娃”，在后一则消息中又提到另一位“波兹德涅耶娃”副教授。如果是不了解情况或不懂俄文的人一定会以为这是两个人。事实上，鲍兹尼耶娃和波兹德涅耶娃是一个人，不过是两种译法。建议通讯社和报纸考虑到读者的方便，尽可能注意译名的一致。
