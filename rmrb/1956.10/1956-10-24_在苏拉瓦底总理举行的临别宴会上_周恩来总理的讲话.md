Xinhua News Agency, 23rd. Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at Prime Minister Suhrawardy's Farewell Banquet.

    Your Excellency Prime Minister Suhrawardy, Ladies and Gentlemen:

    Your Excellency Prime Minister Suhrawardy's visit to our country is a major event in the development of friendly relations between China and Pakistan. During Your Excellency's stay in Beijing, you had several friendly, frank, and unconstrained conversations with our national leaders. Although we have different views on some international issues, we recognize that we have many common points. These common points are sufficient to form the basis for consolidating and developing our friendly relations, and we both have a common desire to develop friendly relations. The joint statement signed by the two Prime Ministers today has well affirmed our common points and expressed our common wishes. There is no doubt that Your Excellency's visit to China has increased mutual understanding between China and Pakistan and will definitely help further the development of friendship between China and Pakistan.

    Your Excellency's visit to China once again proves that mutual visits between government leaders of various countries are of great help in enhancing understanding and friendship between countries. Here, I would like to express my gratitude to Prime Minister Suhrawardy for the kind invitation from the Government of Pakistan to visit Pakistan. I am very happy to accept this invitation and am ready to visit in the near future. I look forward to another pleasant meeting with Your Excellency the Prime Minister and other national leaders of Pakistan.

    Your Excellency, on the eve of your departure from Beijing to visit other cities, please allow me to express my heartfelt thanks to Your Excellency and all the distinguished guests for this visit. I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep feelings of reluctance to part, and wish you a pleasant journey during your tour of various parts of China and on your way home, and good health.

    Now I propose a toast:

    To the health of Your Excellency Prime Minister Suhrawardy and other distinguished Pakistani guests!

    在苏拉瓦底总理举行的临别宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话
    新华社23日讯　周恩来总理在苏拉瓦底总理宴会上的讲话。苏拉瓦底总理阁下，女士们、先生们：
    苏拉瓦底总理阁下这次访问我国，是中巴两国友好关系发展中的一件大事。总理阁下在北京期间，曾经同我国国家领导人员作了多次友好、坦率而无拘束的谈话。尽管我们之间对于若干国际问题具有不同看法，但是我们认识到在我们之间具有许多共同点。这些共同点足以成为巩固和发展我们两国友好关系的基础，而我们又都有着发展友好关系的共同愿望。今天由两国总理签订的联合声明已经很好地把我们之间的共同点肯定下来，并且表达了我们的共同愿望。毫无疑问，总理阁下这次访问中国，增加了中巴两国之间相互的了解，定将有助于中巴两国友谊的进一步发展。
    总理阁下这次访问中国再一次证明各国政府领导人之间的互相访问对于国与国之间的了解和友好的增进是有很大帮助的。在这里，我愿意对苏拉瓦底总理代表巴基斯坦政府邀请我访问巴基斯坦的盛意表示感谢。我很高兴地接受这一邀请，并且准备在短期内前往访问。我期待着再一次同总理阁下以及巴基斯坦国家其他领导人员愉快的会晤。
    总理阁下，当你们离开北京到其他城市进行访问的前夕，请允许我向阁下和各位贵宾们对于你们这次访问表示衷心的感谢。我愿意借这个机会向你们表达深切的惜别之意，并祝你们在中国各地参观和返国途中旅程愉快，身体健康。
    现在我提议：
      为苏拉瓦底总理阁下和其他巴基斯坦贵宾们的健康干杯！
