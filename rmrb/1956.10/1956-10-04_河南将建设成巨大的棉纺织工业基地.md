Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou Electric Dispatch: Henan Province, one of China’s major cotton producing areas, is gradually developing into a large-scale cotton textile industrial base. At present, the number of spindles in the province exceeds about twenty-five times that before liberation; an increase of three point eight times compared with 1952.

The emerging textile industrial city of Zhengzhou did not have any modern cotton textile factories at the beginning of liberation. In the four years since 1952, it has built a modern cotton textile factory every year. This year, two new cotton textile factories have started construction in Zhengzhou. Zhengzhou State-owned Cotton Mill No. 4, which will soon be formally put into production, can produce enough cotton cloth each year for more than 20 million people to make a new set of clothes each. It is expected that by next year, after State-owned Cotton Mills No. 5 and No. 6 are put into production, the cotton yarn and cloth produced in Zhengzhou will basically meet the daily consumption needs of the province's more than 40 million people.

According to the state's plan for the development of the textile industry, new textile industrial zones will continue to emerge in Henan Province.

Before liberation, most of the cotton produced in Henan Province had to be transported to Shanghai and Wuhan; at the same time, cotton and cotton yarn were transported in from other places. After liberation, cotton textile industries began to be built in various parts of the province. Since 1952, large quantities of cotton yarn have been shipped to other places every year. It is estimated that one million bolts of cotton cloth can be transferred out of the province this year.

Henan is one of China's major cotton producing areas, and the quality of cotton is excellent. Last year, the total cotton production of the province exceeded more than double the highest annual output before the Anti-Japanese War.

### 河南将建设成巨大的棉纺织工业基地

    河南将建设成巨大的棉纺织工业基地
    新华社郑州电　我国主要产棉区之一的河南省，正在逐渐发展成为一个规模巨大的棉纺织工业基地。目前，全省拥有的纱锭枚数超过解放前二十五倍左右；比1952年增长了三点八倍。
    新兴的纺织工业城市郑州，在初解放时还没有现代化的棉纺织工厂。自1952年以来的四年中，它每年都兴建一个现代化的棉纺织厂；今年，郑州市又有两个新的棉纺织厂动工兴建。不久将要正式投入生产的郑州国棉四厂，它每年生产的棉布，可以供给两千多万人各做一身新衣。预计到明年，国棉五厂、六厂投入生产后，郑州市生产的棉纱和布匹，就能基本上满足全省四千多万人民日常消费的需要。
    根据国家对于发展纺织工业的计划，河南省内还将陆续出现新的纺织工业区。
    解放以前，河南省所产的棉花，绝大部分都要运到上海和武汉等地；同时由外地运进棉花和棉纱。解放后，省内各地开始建设棉纺织工业。从1952年起，每年都能将大批棉纱调运外地。预计今年将有一百万匹棉布可以调出省外。
    河南是我国主要产棉区之一，棉花品质优良。去年全省棉花的总产量，超过了抗日战争以前的最高年产量一倍以上。
