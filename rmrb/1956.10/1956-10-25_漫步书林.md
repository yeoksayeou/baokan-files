    I suggest that all those who go to various places to collect old books and periodicals should receive assistance and encouragement from the local cultural departments. Those who collect good books and good materials should be commended. If the local area really needs it, they can buy the part they need from them. There is absolutely no need to put on that bureaucratic attitude of "prohibited" and "don't touch." Anyone who can discover good books and good materials has contributed to the country's scientific research and should be assisted and encouraged. We do not have the strength or time to unearth good books and good materials, but those experts in old bookstores who collect books can use their expertise to make effective and beneficial contributions to scientific research. How can we not commend them? Since the promotion of scientific research and the joint public-private ownership of old bookstores, the business of bookstores has suddenly flourished. Good books, rare books, useful and beneficial books, which were previously difficult to see, are now appearing from time to time. For example, the "Shi Cang Wen Xuan" (compiled by Cao Xuequan of the Ming Dynasty) is a newly discovered good book. The most complete "Shi Cang Shi Xuan" has been sold overseas by our unfilial descendants. I have been collecting this book for nearly thirty years, and I already have three large boxes, but I am still missing many volumes. The "Shi Cang Shi Xuan" in the collection of the Beijing Library is also incomplete. However, few people know the name of this "Shi Cang Wen Xuan" (recorded in Li Zhidin's "Cong Shu Ju Yao"). Although it is only twenty volumes, it contains many good materials. This is just one example. Recently, good books have indeed been flowing endlessly like clear springs in the mountains. Ming Dynasty woodblock editions of "Journey to the West" and "Investiture of the Gods" have also appeared. The book collecting experts from old bookstores in Beijing have all gone deep into the countryside of Jiangnan, Hubei, and Guangdong. We believe that they will have more and better harvests.
    The way to find books is not limited to the experts who go out to buy them. There is also a more important avenue that we are about to take but have not yet taken. Two thousand years ago, Emperor Cheng of the Han Dynasty sent the attendant Chen Nong to seek lost books from all over the world. Why can't we send out several "book visiting" work teams today? During the land reform and when receiving the collections of various institutions, many books were preserved in local cultural centers, people's committees in townships, districts, and towns, and county finance sections. Some of them were mistakenly sold as waste paper; some were used for other purposes, turned over, and used as exercise books or account books. The best fate was to be sealed up and waiting to be processed. It is difficult to estimate the exact number of those sealed books. But the number is extremely large, which is conceivable. I personally saw more than 40,000 volumes of books sealed in the Putian Cultural Center. Recently, according to a cultural cadre in Jiangxi Province, there are quite a few cultural centers in his province with more than 10,000 books. If there are 2,000 cultural centers or other places preserving books across the country, with 10,000 volumes in each place, then 20 million volumes of books can be obtained. How much of a role will the acquisition of these 20 million books play in the progress of scientific research? If these preserved books are not promptly centralized, sorted out, and used, they will inevitably be lost or rot in a short period of time. For example, the finance section (?) of the People's Committee of Tongli Town in Suzhou has preserved many ancient books and paintings, all piled on the ground, and some have already begun to rot. Work must begin immediately! I suggest that the central government organize ten or more "book visiting work teams," each team only needs one or two cadres, organize three or four book collecting experts from old bookstores, and go to various provinces and cities together, and then add the working comrades or experts from the cultural departments of various provinces and cities, and they can become several sub-teams. They work separately, and in a few months at least the collection and sorting work can definitely be completed. We, including myself, always "discuss but do not decide, decide but do not act." Isn't this utter bureaucracy? We should rise up and act, overcome all difficulties and start immediately! Moreover, this work will not have any insurmountable difficulties.

    谈访书
    西谛
    我建议：凡到各地收古旧书刊的人，都应该受到当地文化部门的协助和鼓励。凡收得好书、好资料的，就应该加以表扬。当地如果的确有需要，可以转向他们购买下自己所需要的那一部分，完全不必要摆出那一付“禁止”、“不许动”的官僚架子。凡是能够发现好书、好资料的人，就是对国家的科学研究事业有功劳，就应该加以协助和鼓励。我们没有力量、没有时间去发掘出好书、好资料来，而那些古旧书店的收书的专家们，却能发挥其特长，为科学研究事业作出有效、有益的贡献，怎能不加以表扬呢？自从提倡科学研究和古旧书店公私合营以来，书店的营业顿时兴旺起来，好书、奇书，有用、有益的书，从前轻易看不到的，如今竟不时的出现了。像“石仓文选”（明曹学全辑）就是新出现的一部好书。最全的一部“石仓诗选”，已被我们不肖的子孙卖到海外去了。我着意搜集此书，将近三十年，已有三大箱，所缺尚多。北京图书馆藏的那部“石仓诗选”，也不全。而这部“石仓文选”却很少有人知其名（李之鼎“丛书举要”著录）。虽只二十卷，而其中好资料不少。这只是举一个例子而已。近来好书的确是像山间的清泉似地涌流不息。明刻本的“西游记”和“封神传”也已出现了。北京的古旧书店的收书专家们都已深入江南、湖、广的乡间去了。我们相信，他们将会有更多更好的收获的。
    访书之道，亦不限于收书专家们的四出访购。还有更重要的一条大路，我们正要走而未走。二千年前，汉成帝就曾使谒者陈农，求遗书于天下。我们今天为什么不能派遣若干的“访书”工作团呢？在土改里，在接收各个机构的藏书时，有不少是被保存在各地文化馆里，乡、区、镇的人民委员会里，县的财政科里，其中，有的是胡里胡涂地被当作废纸卖出去了；有的是被废物利用，反折过来，当作习学簿或帐簿去了。最好的运命是被封存起来，以待处理。那些被封存的图书，究竟数量多少，很难估量。但为数极多，是可想像得到的。我亲自见到的被封存在莆田文化馆里的书，就有四万多册。最近，据江西省的文化干部报告，他的省里有万册以上图书的文化馆就不在少数。假如，全国有二千个文化馆或其他保存书籍的地方，每一处以一万册计，则已有二千万册的图书可以得到了。这二千万册图书的获得，对于科学研究工作的进行将有多末大的作用啊！而这些被保存的图书，如果不及时地加以集中，加以整理，加以使用，则必将于短时期内有散失或霉烂之虞。举一个例：苏州同里镇的人民委员会的财政科（？）里就保存了很多的古书、古画，全堆在地上，有的已经开始霉烂了。立刻就得开始工作！我建议：由中央组织十个或十个以上的“访书工作团”，每团只要一二个干部，组织古旧书店里的三四个收书专家们，一同到各省、市去，再加入各省、市的文化部门的工作同志们或专家们，就可以成为若干的分团了。他们分头工作，不出几个月，至少收集和整理的工作一定可以告成的。我们，包括我自己在内，老是“议而不决，决而不行”。这不是十足的官僚主义是什么！应该起而立行，克服一切困难而立即开始！何况这个工作并不会有什么不能克服的困难呢。（本节续昨完）
