    Driving a Domestically Produced Car
    Xichen
    Driving a domestically produced "Liberation" brand car, my heart is filled with excitement. What I am driving is not just a car, I am driving happiness soaring! The parts of this car, they are not just steel, they are forged from the hearts of the people across the country; the honking of the horn, it is the sound of the beating hearts of the people throughout the nation. Driving a domestically produced "Liberation" brand car, my heart constantly reminds me in secret: I must carefully control it forward, all the way to climb that communist peak.

    驾驶着国产汽车
    曦晨我驾驶国产“解放”牌汽车，我的心在激动，我驾驶的哪里是汽车啊，我是驾驶着幸福在飞腾！这汽车上的零件哪里是钢铁，它们是全国人民的心铸成；那汽笛的喇叭鸣叫啊，就是全国人民跳动的心声。我驾驶国产“解放”牌汽车，我的心不断地暗中叮咛：我要好好地操纵它前进啊，一直爬上那共产主义的高峰。
