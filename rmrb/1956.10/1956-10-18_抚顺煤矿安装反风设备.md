Xinhua News Agency News: All mines affiliated with the Fushun Coal Mine have now been equipped with reversing ventilation equipment. According to recent tests conducted at the Open-pit Deep Section Mine and the Longfeng Mine’s Talian Pit, when this reversing ventilation equipment is activated, the airflow underground is immediately blocked by wind force coming from the opposite direction. It only takes seven minutes for the underground airflow to completely reverse direction, with the air volume remaining normal. Because this equipment can quickly change the direction of airflow underground, if fires or other disasters occur in the mine's shafts, yards, or main roadways in the future, they will not easily spread to the working faces, ensuring that workers in the working faces can safely evacuate. After the disaster is resolved, this equipment can also restore the underground airflow to its normal direction.

    抚顺煤矿安装反风设备
    据新华社讯　抚顺煤矿所属矿井现在已经全部安装上反风设备。根据露天深部坑和龙凤矿塔连坑最近所作的试验，这种反风设备开动起来，矿井下面流动的风量立刻就会被来自相反方向的风力挡住，只要七分钟的时间，井下风力就会全部向相反的方向流动，风量仍然正常。因为这种设备可以迅速改变井下风向，今后如果在矿井的井筒、车场或主要巷道上发生火灾等灾害的时候，就不容易蔓延到掌子里去，这就保证了在掌子里工作的工人能够安全地离开掌子面。等灾害解除以后，这种设备还能使矿井下的风力恢复正常的流动方向。
