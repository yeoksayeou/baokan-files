Xinhua News Agency, October 15th. The Socialist Academy, a college where senior cadres from various democratic parties and non-party democratic individuals study Marxism-Leninism, held its opening ceremony in the CPPCC Auditorium in Beijing this morning.

    The first group of one hundred and fifty-five students attended the opening ceremony. Some are members of the Standing Committee or members of the National Committee of the CPPCC, or vice-chairmen or standing committee members of provincial or municipal CPPCCs, central standing committee members or central committee members of democratic parties, some are vice-governors or heads of government departments, and some are executive committee members of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, factory directors, and professors and associate professors from universities, etc. More than half of them are over fifty years old.

    The academy offers three political theory courses: dialectical and historical materialism, political economy, and the history of the Chinese revolution. In addition, it organizes the study of some important current affairs policies and appropriately organizes some visits and other teaching and tutoring activities. The study period is one year. The study method adopts the principles of freedom, voluntariness, and consciousness. In addition to necessary lectures by teachers, the emphasis is on free research, democratic discussion, and encouraging brainstorming and independent thinking. Academically, various opinions are allowed to exist and be debated. There are no exams or tests at the time of admission, and no investigation registration forms are filled out; there is no review of history or ideological examination during the study period; there are no exams or tests at the time of graduation; whether to write study notes and the number of words written are all based on personal willingness.

    At the beginning of the opening ceremony, Wu Yuzhang, the president of the Socialist Academy, gave a speech. He said that according to the decision of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on organizing political and theoretical studies for democratic individuals and industrialists and businessmen from all walks of life, the Chinese People's University was entrusted to establish the Socialist Academy. He said that the Socialist Academy was established to meet the needs of the new political situation of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country, and to meet the requirements of democratic individuals from all walks of life for political and theoretical studies.

    Wu Yuzhang said that the purpose of the Socialist Academy is to help senior cadres from various democratic parties and non-party individuals, as well as democratic individuals from all aspects, improve their political and theoretical levels, so as to better serve socialist construction. Wu Yuzhang called on the students to learn to use the standpoints, viewpoints, and methods of Marxism-Leninism to correctly handle the practical problems of the Chinese revolution with a spirit of hard study.

    After Wu Yuzhang's speech, Zhang Bojun, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Ma Yinchu, President of Peking University, addressed the meeting successively.

    Zhang Bojun, on behalf of the National Committee of the CPPCC, congratulated the opening of the Socialist Academy. He said that some people had proposed to establish this academy several years ago, and I also participated in the proposal. This proposal is very good, showing that we want to make progress. He said that at present, the task of socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory nationwide and will be fully completed in three to five years. By then, new relations of production will also fully appear. However, bourgeois ideology and petty-bourgeois ideology will still exist for a considerable period of time. This is a contradiction: the contradiction between the new relations of production and the old ideology. To solve this contradiction, we must study Marxism-Leninism and understand the laws of social development. He also said that many members of democratic parties have undertaken important work in state organs, and the Chinese Communist Party has recently put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" between the democratic parties and the Communist Party, which makes it even more necessary to improve our theoretical level in order to serve the people well and for a long time until the communist society. This is not easy to achieve without a considerable foundation of Marxist-Leninist theory and an improvement in the level of consciousness, and it is difficult to do a good job. Zhang Bojun finally hoped that everyone would study hard, develop independent thinking, and promote a study style of free research and democratic discussion.

    In his speech, Ma Yinchu said that he envied everyone for having the opportunity to study at the Socialist Academy. He said that the courses to be studied must be combined and studied together, and they cannot be separated. He also said that there can be "a hundred schools of thought contending" in learning, but it would be wrong to regard Marxism-Leninism as one school to contend with. It is necessary to understand that Marxism-Leninism is the overall guiding ideology, and contention must be carried out under this overall guiding ideology.

    Then, Li Dequan, a student and a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the CPPCC, spoke. She said that today I am very happy that I can still study at the age of sixty, and I am studying Marxism-Leninism. She said, I must study hard and combine the theory I have learned with practice. Chairman Mao combined Marxism-Leninism with the actual situation of the Chinese revolution, won the victory of the Chinese revolution, and enabled us to study at the Socialist Academy today. I will never be late or leave early, and I will show what I have learned in my work.

    Wang Baozhen, a 76-year-old student and member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said, when I signed up for the study, the comrades cared about my health, and I am very grateful. But my blood pressure is not high. The courses are not too heavy either. For me, studying is still a relaxed and enjoyable thing. He said that because he recalled the lessons of his failures in the revolution in the past fifty years, which was because of the lack of Marxism-Leninism, he felt a very urgent need to study Marxism-Leninism, so he insisted on coming to study. I admire Marxism-Leninism, and I admire the truth more than I admire my own life.

    Finally, Wei Lihuang, a student and a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the CPPCC, spoke, saying, "As the ancients said, 'If a worker wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools.'" My purpose in coming to study Marxism-Leninism is to improve my ability to serve the people. He said that in studying, he would try to connect with the actual situation of the Chinese revolution and his own thoughts in order to improve his ideological level. If he did not understand something, he would ask the comrades for advice, and if he still did not understand, he would ask the teacher for advice until he understood.

    Also invited to attend today's meeting were Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Li Weihan, Baurhan, Vice Chairmen of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and members of the Standing Committee.

    社会主义学院举行开学典礼
    新华社15日讯　各民主党派和无党派民主人士中的高级干部学习马克思列宁主义的学院——社会主义学院，今天上午在北京政协礼堂举行开学典礼大会。
    第一期一百五十五名学员参加了开学典礼大会。他们有的是政协全国委员会常务委员、委员或省市政协副主席、常务委员，民主党派的中央常务委员或中央委员，有的是副省长或政府部门负责人，还有的是全国工商联执行委员，工厂厂长，高等学校教授、副教授等。其中五十岁以上的占一半以上。
    这个学院开设三门政治理论课程：辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义、政治经济学和中国革命史。此外，还组织一些重要时事政策的学习，并适当的组织一些参观及其他教学辅导活动。学习期限是一年。学习的方法是采取自由、自愿、自觉的原则。除教员作必要的讲授之外，着重自由研究，民主讨论，提倡开动脑筋，独立思考，在学术上允许各种见解的存在和争辩。在入学时不举行考试和测验，不填写调查登记表；学习期间不审查历史，不检查思想；结业时候也不举行考试和测验；写学习心得与否、写的字数多少都依个人自愿。
    在开学典礼大会开始时，社会主义学院院长吴玉章讲话。他说，根据中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会关于组织各界民主人士和工商业者进行政治学习和理论学习的决定，委托中国人民大学创办社会主义学院。他说，社会主义学院是为了适应我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造新的政治形势的需要，适应各界民主人士对政治学习和理论学习的要求而成立的。
    吴玉章说，社会主义学院的目的，是帮助各民主党派和无党派以及各方面民主人士中的高级干部提高政治理论水平，以便更好地为社会主义建设服务。吴玉章号召学员们以刻苦钻研的精神学会能够用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，来正确地处理中国革命的实际问题。
    吴玉章讲话后，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席章伯钧和北京大学校长马寅初先后向大会致词。
    章伯钧代表政协全国委员会对社会主义学院的开学表示祝贺。他说，几年前就有人提议建立这个学院，我也参加提议了。这个提议是很好的，表现我们要进步。他说，目前，社会主义改造任务已经在全国范围内取得了决定性的胜利，三五年后就将全部完成，到那时，新的生产关系也将全部出现。但是，资产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想将仍然会相当长期存在的。这是一个矛盾：新的生产关系和旧的思想的矛盾。要解决这个矛盾，就必须学习马克思列宁主义，认识社会发展规律。他又说，许多民主党派成员担负了国家机关的重要工作，中国共产党在不久以前又提出了各民主党派和共产党“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，这就更加需要提高我们的理论水平，以便很好地长期地为人民服务直到共产主义社会。没有马克思列宁主义理论的相当基础和觉悟程度的提高，是不容易办到的，要做好工作也是有困难的。章伯钧最后希望大家努力学习，发展独立思考，提倡自由研究，民主讨论等学习风气。
    马寅初在讲话中说他很羡慕大家有机会到社会主义学院来学习。他说，所要学习的几门课程，必须结合起来学习才行，不能把它们割裂开来。他又说，在学习中可以“百家争鸣”，但如果把马克思列宁主义作为一家这样来争鸣，那就错了。必须了解马克思列宁主义是总的领导思想，要在这一总的领导思想下争鸣。
    接着是学员、政协全国委员会常务委员李德全讲话。她说，今天我非常高兴，六十多岁了还能学习，而且是学习马克思列宁主义。她说，我一定要努力学习，把学习的理论和实际结合起来。毛主席用马克思列宁主义同中国革命实际结合起来，取得了中国革命的胜利，使我们今天能够入社会主义学院学习。我一定不迟到，不早退，把学习到的东西，在工作中表现出来。
    七十六岁的学员、中国国民党革命委员会中央委员王葆真讲话说，我报名学习的时候，同志们关怀我的健康，我很感谢。但我的血压并不高。课程也不太重。对我说来，学习还是轻松愉快的事情。他说，由于回忆起我过去五十年在革命中失败的教训，就是因为缺少马克思列宁主义，因此我感到非常迫切需要学习马克思列宁主义，因此我坚持要求来学习。我爱慕马克思列宁主义，我爱慕真理，甚于爱慕自己的生命。
    最后，学员、政协全国委员会常务委员卫立煌讲了话，他说，古人说“工欲善其事，必先利其器”。我来学习马克思列宁主义的目的，就是为了提高自己为人民服务的本领。他表示在学习中要尽量联系中国革命实际和自己的思想，以提高自己的思想水平。不明白的地方向同志们请教，再不明白就向老师请教，直到明白为止。
    应邀参加今天大会的，还有中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会副主席李济深、沈钧儒、黄炎培、李维汉、鲍尔汉和各常务委员等。
