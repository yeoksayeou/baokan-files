Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th – Two hundred thousand people from all walks of life in Shanghai held an unprecedented grand rally at the People's Square today to welcome President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia.

　　In the vast People's Square, crowds of people participating in the welcoming rally were densely packed, stretching as far as the eye could see. As early as five or six hours before the start of the welcoming rally, people poured in like a tide from factories, schools, government offices, and neighborhoods.

　　On the rostrum in the center of the square, the national flags of China and Indonesia and huge portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and President Sukarno were hung. Huge banners were erected on both sides of the rostrum, reading: "Salute to President Sukarno!" "Long Live Asian-African and World Peace!". A row of flagpoles opposite the rostrum raised flags with a sky-blue background and white doves of peace.

　　At exactly 2:00 p.m., President Sukarno, accompanied by Shanghai Mayor Chen Yi, ascended the rostrum. At this moment, the band played a welcome song, and the welcoming crowd gathered in the square waved the flags, flowers, and balloons in their hands, sending out long and continuous cheers to President Sukarno. Dozens of children ran to the rostrum to present flowers to President Sukarno and senior Indonesian officials. Also ascending the rostrum were Ke Qingshi, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Xu Jianguo, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, and representatives of the Shanghai local organizations of various democratic parties.

　　The welcoming rally began. The band played the national anthems of Indonesia and China. At this moment, countless colored balloons carrying banners saluting President Sukarno and the Indonesian flag flew into the sky.

　　Shanghai Mayor Chen Yi first delivered a speech at the rally (full text on page 5). He extended a warm welcome and heartfelt respect to President Sukarno and the distinguished Indonesian guests on behalf of the six million people of Shanghai. He said: The people of Shanghai have read the important and moving speeches delivered by His Excellency the President in our capital, Beijing. These speeches have resonated with the people of Shanghai, and they have closely connected our ideals with the ideals of the Indonesian people. That is: the ideal of independence, the ideal of peace, the ideal of a new world.

　　Mayor Chen Yi also said: Now, the respected President is about to deliver a speech to the people of Shanghai. The President's speech and the President's visit to Shanghai will further consolidate and develop the historical friendship between the people of our country and the people of Indonesia.

　　After concluding his speech, Mayor Chen Yi invited President Sukarno to deliver a speech to the citizens of Shanghai. At this time, colored balloons rose into the sky again, and the crowd cheered "Long Live Peace" and "Bung Karno" for as long as five minutes. Then, President Sukarno delivered an enthusiastic and lengthy speech. (Full text on page 5). His speech was constantly interrupted by storms of applause and long-lasting cheers.

　　President Sukarno concluded his speech by shouting: Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the Republic of Indonesia! Long live the friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia! Long live world peace!

　　The crowd in the square also shouted in unison: Long live! Long live! Thousands of bouquets of flowers were waved together, and countless colored balloons rose into the sky from the crowd. President Sukarno stood on the stage, raised his hand to salute the crowd, and said in Chinese: "Thank you."

　　After President Sukarno finished his speech, Mayor Chen Yi presented him with gifts on behalf of the people of Shanghai. When President Sukarno picked up the embroidered portrait of himself with an exquisite photo frame, the audience cheered him enthusiastically again.

　　Subsequently, President Sukarno, accompanied by Mayor Chen Yi, stepped down from the rostrum and approached the crowd in the square. At this moment, the crowd became even more jubilant. The gorgeously dressed women and children standing at the forefront of the crowd excitedly cheered and paid tribute to the President. A girl ran up and tied her red scarf around the President's neck. When the President entered the ranks of the children, the children sang the Indonesian song "Fly, Our Flag!". The President stopped, listened with a smile, and then sang along with the children's clear voices. The President walked from one end of the crowd to the other. Wherever he went, a center of jubilation formed.

　　When President Sukarno returned to the guest house by car, the wide streets were crowded with people applauding and welcoming the President.

　　Today, in this largest city in China, countless banners and the national flags of the Republic of Indonesia are hung on every thoroughfare, and the whole city is decorated with lights and festoons. All government offices, factories, and schools are dressed in festive attire, and the shop windows have also been newly decorated. Many high-rise buildings are decorated with huge banners dozens of feet high paying tribute to President Sukarno from the top to the bottom of the building.

    上海二十万人集会欢迎苏加诺总统
    苏加诺总统在会上发表了演讲
    据新华社上海11日电　上海市各界人民二十万人，今天在人民广场举行空前盛大的集会，欢迎印度尼西亚共和国苏加诺总统。
    在宽阔的人民广场上，密密层层地排列着一眼望不到边的参加欢迎大会的人群。早在欢迎大会开始前的五六个小时，人们就从工厂、学校、机关、里弄里像潮水一样地涌向这里。
    在广场正中的主席台上，悬挂着中国和印度尼西亚两国国旗和毛泽东主席、苏加诺总统的巨像。主席台两旁竖立着巨大的标语牌，上面写着：“向苏加诺总统致敬！”“亚非和世界和平万岁！”。主席台对面的一排旗杆上升起了天蓝色底上绘着白色和平鸽的旗帜。
    下午两时正，苏加诺总统由上海市陈毅市长陪同登上了主席台。这时，乐队奏起了欢迎曲，聚集在广场上的欢迎群众挥动着手中的旗帜、鲜花和气球，向苏加诺总统发出长久不息的欢呼声。几十名少年儿童跑上主席台向苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚高级官员们献花。同时登上主席台的有中共上海市委员会书记柯庆施、上海市副市长许建国等和各民主党派上海市地方组织的代表。
    欢迎大会开始。乐队奏印度尼西亚和中国两国国歌。这时，无数彩色气球带着向苏加诺总统致敬的标语和印度尼西亚国旗飞向天空。
    上海市市长陈毅在大会上首先致词。（全文见第五版）他代表上海六百万人民向苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚的贵宾们，表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意。他说：上海人民读了总统阁下在我国首都北京发表的那些重要的、动人的演说，这些演说引起了上海人民的共鸣，它把我们的理想同印度尼西亚人民的理想紧密地连接起来了。这就是：独立的理想，和平的理想，新世界的理想。
    陈毅市长又说：现在，敬爱的总统就要向上海人民发表演说了。总统的演说和总统来到上海访问，必将进一步巩固和发展我国人民和印度尼西亚人民之间的历史友谊。
    陈毅市长在结束他的讲话后就邀请苏加诺总统向上海市民发表演说。这时，天空中又升起了彩色的气球，全场群众欢呼“和平万岁”“朋加诺”达五分钟之久。接着，苏加诺总统发表了热情洋溢的长篇演说。（全文见第五版）他的演说不断被暴风雨般的掌声和经久不息的欢呼声打断。
    苏加诺总统在结束他的演说时高呼：中华人民共和国万岁！印度尼西亚共和国万岁！中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国之间的友谊万岁！世界和平万岁！
    广场上的群众也同声高呼：万岁！万岁！成千上万的花束一齐挥动，数不清的彩色气球从群众队伍中升上天空。苏加诺总统站在台上举手向群众致意，并且用中国话说：“谢谢。”
    苏加诺总统演说完毕后，陈毅市长代表上海人民向他赠送了礼品。当苏加诺总统拿起送给他的配上精致照像框的总统本人绣像的时候，全场又向他热烈地欢呼起来。
    随后，苏加诺总统由陈毅市长陪同，走下主席台走近广场上的群众行列。这时，群众更加欢腾起来。站在群众队伍最前列的盛装的妇女和少年儿童们，兴奋地欢呼着向总统致敬。一个女孩奔上来，把自己的红领巾系在总统的颈子上。总统走进少年儿童们的队伍时，孩子们唱起了印度尼西亚歌曲“飘扬，我们的国旗！”。总统停下来微笑地聆听着，然后和着孩子们清脆的歌声唱了起来。总统从群众行列的这一头走到另一头。他走到那里，那里就形成欢腾的中心。
    当苏加诺总统乘车回迎宾馆的时候，在宽阔的马路两侧挤满了人群，向总统鼓掌欢迎。
    今天，在这座中国最大的城市里，各个通衢要道都悬挂着数不尽的横幅标语和印度尼西亚共和国国旗，全市到处张灯结彩。各机关、工厂、学校都披上了节日的盛装，商店的橱窗也被装饰一新，许多高楼大厦从楼顶直贯楼下挂着几十丈高的向苏加诺总统致敬的巨幅标语。
