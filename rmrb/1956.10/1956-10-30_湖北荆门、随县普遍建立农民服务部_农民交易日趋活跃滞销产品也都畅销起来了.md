Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 28th. Since the opening of free markets under state leadership in some areas of Hubei Province, rural trade has become increasingly active.

In some areas of the province, farmer service departments have been established under the leadership of supply and marketing cooperatives as venues for farmers to conduct free trade. Jingmen County now has an average of one to three farmer service departments in each district. In Junchuan District of Suixian County, twenty-four farmer service departments have been successively established. Nearby farmers are constantly bringing firewood, charcoal, and homemade bamboo and wooden wares such as baskets and buckets to the service departments for sale. Eighty kinds of agricultural and sideline products that were originally stagnant in this area are now selling very well. When there is an oversupply of some commodities and farmers cannot find sales outlets in the service departments, the supply and marketing cooperatives are responsible for purchasing them and adjusting market supply and demand. The farmer transaction volume of these twenty-four farmer service departments in September accounted for more than 40% of the total retail sales in the district. Farmers in counties surrounding Wuhan City have recently been allowed to sell Nan bamboo, reed mats, and other local specialties in Wuhan City. This not only stimulated the enthusiasm of farmers in managing sideline occupations, but also met the needs of various basic construction units and handicraft production cooperatives in Wuhan City for these local specialties.

After the opening of the free market, the operational enthusiasm of grassroots supply and marketing cooperative staff in various places has also greatly increased. They have begun to actively seek sales channels for stagnant agricultural and sideline products, help farmers increase their income, and strive to purchase goods that are out of stock to solve the problem of market supply falling short of demand. The local product prickly ash (huajiao) in Macheng County was not included in the unified procurement list of the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the past, and the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative did not purchase it, which dampened farmers' interest in producing prickly ash. Recently, the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative took the initiative to contact relevant departments in Henan Province and promoted the sale of 8,000 jin of prickly ash for farmers. In Yingshan County, which is rich in industrial raw materials such as cork, raw lacquer, and white wax, the local supply and marketing cooperatives have increased the purchase of nearly 200 kinds of local and special products in recent months, selling them to Guangdong, Hunan, Henan, Hebei, and other places, increasing farmers' income by more than 110,000 yuan. The supply of raw materials for traditional Chinese medicine such as rehmannia glutinosa in the Shashi market was very tight in the past. Later, the Shashi Chinese Herbal Medicine Wholesale Station of the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative sent people to Xinjiang, the place of origin, to purchase them, meeting the needs of consumers.

### 湖北荆门、随县普遍建立农民服务部  农民交易日趋活跃滞销产品也都畅销起来了

    湖北荆门、随县普遍建立农民服务部
    农民交易日趋活跃滞销产品也都畅销起来了
    新华社武汉28日电　湖北省部分地区自从开辟国家领导下的自由市场以来，农村贸易日趋活跃。
    省内部分地区已经在供销社领导下成立了农民服务部，作为农民开展自由贸易的场所。荆门县现在平均每个区设立了一个到三个农民服务部。随县均川区陆续成立了二十四个农民服务部，附近农民不断将木柴、木炭和自制的提篮、桶瓢等竹木器挑来服务部出卖。这个地区原来滞销的八十种副产品现在都很畅销。当有些商品上市量过多，农民在服务部里找不到销路时，供销社还负责收购下来，调剂市场供需。这二十四个农民服务部9月份的农民交易额，占到全区零售总额40％以上。武汉市周围各县农民近来也被允许到武汉市出售楠竹、芦席等土特产品。这不但刺激了农民们经营副业的积极性，而且武汉市各基本建设单位和手工业生产社对这些土特产品的需要也得到了满足。
    自由市场开辟后，各地基层供销社工作人员的经营积极性也大大提高。他们开始主动替滞销的土特产品寻找销路，帮助农民增加收入，并且努力采购脱销的物资，以解决市场供不应求的问题。麻城县的土产品花椒，过去因为不在省供销社统一规定的收购商品之列，县供销社不予收购；农民生产花椒的兴趣也因之减退。最近县供销社主动同河南有关部门取得联系，为农民推销了八千斤花椒。盛产栓皮、生漆、白腊等工业原料的应山县，几个月来，当地供销合作社增加收购了近二百种土特产品，销往广东、湖南、河南、河北等地，使农民增加收入十一万多元。原来沙市市场上生地等药材供应十分紧张，后来省供销社沙市中药材批发站派人到产地新疆去采购，满足了消费者的要求。
