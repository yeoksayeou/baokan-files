    My Memories of Mr. Lu Xun Forty-Five Years Ago
    Lin Binggu
    Mr. Lu Xun has been dead for almost twenty years. Recently, while browsing through the reprinted edition of Lu Xun's diary, starting from May 1912, I saw that Mr. Lu Xun had recorded some of his work at the Ministry of Education in Beijing at the time. To others, it may seem too brief to be understood. But it triggered in this old man some memories of events from forty-five years ago, that is, during the period from 1912 to 1913 when I worked with Mr. Lu Xun at the Ministry of Education in Beijing.

    Soon after the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution, I resigned from teaching positions at several schools in Chengdu and immediately went to Nanjing to join old Tongmenghui comrades in participating in the revolution and establishing the Republic of China. In 1912, I served as a secretary to Mr. Sun Yat-sen at the Provisional Presidential Office. Soon after, the North-South peace talks were concluded, and Tang Shaoyi came from Beijing to Nanjing to take over the provisional government. To connect with various circles in the South, he joined the Kuomintang and earnestly advised colleagues, saying that from now on, the North and South were one family, and everyone should go to the Beijing government to serve. Comrade Cai Yuanpei, who had agreed to head the Ministry of Education, specifically invited me to return to the field of education to assist him. At that time, some of the staff of the Ministry of Education in Nanjing were also invited to go north, and Mr. Lu Xun was one of them. However, I went north with Mr. Cai on a special train prepared by Tang Shaoyi. According to Mr. Lu Xun's diary, he arrived in Beijing a little later than us.

    At this time, Mr. Lu Xun was using his original name, Zhou Shuren. When he first arrived at the Ministry of Education in Beijing, he served as a staff member in the Second Section of the Department of Social Education, I served as a reviewer in the Review Department, and Xu Shoushang served as a staff member in the First Section of the Department of General Education. Soon, Mr. Lu Xun and I were both appointed as secretaries of the Ministry, and Mr. Lu Xun also concurrently served as the head of the First Section of the Department of Social Education, in charge of libraries, museums, and other matters. At that time, many of the old officials of the Qing government's Ministry of Education were retained. Their feudal ideas and conservative consciousness were very strong. They regarded us southerners as revolutionary new parties, and there was always an air of "respecting ghosts and gods while keeping them at a distance" in their interactions. Mr. Lu Xun and I came from the South, and we were both engaged in scientific study in Japan earlier – although at this time Mr. Lu Xun’s interest in self-study had gradually turned to literature and art – naturally, mainly because we were comrades invited by Mr. Cai, so we were closer. At that time, the Vice Minister, Fan Yuanlian, who was affiliated with the Northern faction, had quite a scholar-tyrant style. In order to compete with Mr. Cai for power, he organized the Shangzhi Society, which was intended to secretly establish the banner of the old system of the Ministry of Education. Sure enough, soon Fan, with the support of Yuan Shikai, replaced Mr. Cai as the Minister. Lu Xun wrote in his diary on September 6, 1912: "Went to the Ministry staff meeting in the morning, only Minister Fan gave a speech, the words were very strange." This dissatisfaction can be seen in just a few words.

    On March 20, 1913, Comrade Song Jiaoren, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, was assassinated by Yuan's henchmen at the Shanghai East Railway Station. Because of this, I indignantly resigned and returned to Sichuan. Since then, we have been separated and I have never met Mr. Lu Xun again. After the Song case occurred, Mr. Lu Xun was also indignant and uneasy. My son, Ru Ji, once told me that when Lu Xun later engaged in a war of words with Chen Yuan (Xiying), Chen tried to falsely accuse Mr. Lu Xun of compromising and being perfunctory towards the Northern bureaucrats, saying that Mr. Lu Xun remained peacefully in the Ministry of Education during Yuan's perverse era. As far as I can remember, I know that Mr. Lu Xun expressed indignation and opposition at that time. From this, the noble character of Mr. Lu Xun can be seen even more.

    Yuan, as a Northern warlord and枭雄 (xiāo xióng, a bold and ambitious person, often with negative connotations), after seizing power due to circumstances and opportunities, only aimed to suppress revolutionaries in order to facilitate his theft of the country and claim of emperorship. He was naturally indifferent to education, but in order to put on airs, he summoned the staff of the Ministry of Education to the Presidential Office in December 1912 to give a speech. Yuan's speech that day was empty and lengthy, but apart from repeatedly saying that he had edited several textbooks during his tenure as Beiyang Minister to boast about himself, he had no understanding of the new education policies and aims of the Republic of China. Mr. Lu Xun and I, who were present, could only smile at each other. It is no wonder that the temporary education conference convened by the Ministry at that time actually had the absurd idea of ​​deleting aesthetic education. Lu Xun sighed in his diary and wrote: "Such swine and dogs, pitiful! Pitiful!" At that time, Mr. Cai was advocating an educational policy of cultivating citizens' morality through aesthetic education, which Mr. Lu Xun strongly supported, and he drafted documents in this regard on behalf of Mr. Cai. The diary also often records the purchase of ancient stone carvings and art books. The first volume, first issue of the "Monthly Journal of the Compilation Department of the Ministry of Education," published in early February 1913, which I have in my collection, contains a "Draft Opinion on Promoting Art" signed by Zhou Shuren; and later issues of the same journal also contain writings on art by Japanese people translated by Mr. Lu Xun. This also shows Mr. Lu Xun's dedication to his love of art, which lasted for decades. In his later years, his early promotion of woodcuts and introduction of Western prints, etc., made truly indelible contributions to the development of Chinese art.

    I am three years older than Mr. Lu Xun. However, Mr. Lu Xun, at the age of fifty-six, passed away suddenly, but he had already laid the foundation for Chinese new literature. Especially in the twenty years since then, after the victory of the people's revolution that Mr. Lu Xun longed for all his life, Mr. Lu Xun's dozens of volumes of great works are emitting boundless light, and it can be predicted that they will become increasingly brilliant. Mr. Lu Xun is indeed worthy of being called spiritually immortal! And I, at my old age, although I can still eat well and read books, have ultimately achieved nothing. At this time of national commemoration of Mr. Lu Xun, I feel doubly ashamed and grieved for Mr. Lu Xun's untimely death. – Under a mixture of emotions, I hastily wrote this recollection of past events, just to express my respect for my old friend, because those colleagues who went to the Ministry to work every day forty-five years ago have not been seen again to this day.

    我所记忆的四十五年前的鲁迅先生
    林冰骨
    鲁迅先生逝世已快二十年了。最近翻阅影印的鲁迅日记，从1912年5月开始，先生记了一些当时在北京教育部供职的情形。在旁人看来，恐怕觉得过于简略，不能了解。但这却触发了老朽的我几件四十五年前往事的回忆，即是在1912至1913年同鲁迅先生在北京教育部共事那一段时间的。
    辛亥革命刚一爆发，我辞去成都几个学校的教席，立赴南京会合老同盟会同志参预革命和建立民国。1912年我任临时大总统府孙中山先生的秘书，不久南北和议告成，唐绍仪由北京来南京接收临时政府。他为联络南方各界，加入了国民党，并且亲切劝说同人，说从此南北一家，大家应同往北京政府宣劳。同志蔡孑民允长教育部，特约我仍回到教育界本行同往襄助。那时南京教育部职员也有一部分人被邀北上，鲁迅先生就是其中之一。不过我是随同蔡先生乘唐绍仪特备的专车北上的，看鲁迅先生的日记，他到北京较我们晚一点。
    这时鲁迅先生用的是周树人的本名。初到北京教育部，他任社会教育司第二科科员，我任审查处审查员，许寿裳任普通教育司第一科科员。不久鲁迅和我同被任命为本部佥事，鲁迅先生并兼任社会教育司第一科科长，主管图书馆、博物馆等事。当时清政府的学部旧人留用的很多，他们的封建观念和保守意识都很强烈，目我们南方来的为革命新党，应对往来之间总有一种敬鬼神而远之的神气。我同鲁迅先生他们同自南方来，又都是以前留日学科学的——不过这时鲁迅先生的自学兴趣，已渐转向文学艺术方面了——自然主要还是因为同是蔡先生约来的同志，所以较为亲切。当时任次长的范源廉，依附北方派系，颇有学阀作风，他为与蔡先生对抗争权，组织了尚志学会，便是暗中树立学部旧统系旗帜之意。果然不久范便借袁世凯的支持，代蔡先生为总长。鲁迅在1912年9月6日记道：“上午赴本部职员会，仅有范总长演说，其词甚怪。”这不满之情在寥寥十数字中也看得出来的。
    1913年3月20日农林部总长宋教仁同志被袁贼买人在上海东站暗杀，我因之愤而弃职回川。从此两地暌违，即未再遇见过鲁迅先生。在宋案发生后，鲁迅先生也是愤慨和不安的。儿子如稷从前对我谈过，鲁迅在以后同陈源（西滢）笔战时，陈曾想诬枉鲁迅先生对于北方官僚的妥协敷衍，说鲁迅先生在袁贼倒行时代，始终安居教育部。就我记忆所及，知道那时鲁迅先生是表示过愤慨反对的。从此，更可见出鲁迅先生的高尚品格。
    袁贼以北方官僚枭雄，因缘时会窃柄国政之后，其志只在镇压革命党人，便于他的盗国称帝。他对于教育事业自然是漠不关心的，但为了装腔作态，他在1912年12月却在总统府召集教育部同人讲话。袁贼那天的说辞虽然空洞冗长，但除去反复说他以前在北洋大臣任内，曾编辑教科书数种来自我夸耀外，对于民国的新教育的方针和宗旨，便毫无认识。在座的我同鲁迅先生他们，也只好相视一笑。这无怪当时本部召开的临时教育会议，竟有主张删却美感教育的谬说。鲁迅在日记中叹息地记着：“此种豚犬，可怜！可怜！”那时蔡先生正主张以美育教育培养公民道德的教育方针，鲁迅先生是极力赞助的，并代蔡先生拟草这方面的文件，日记中更常记着购买古代石刻和艺术书籍的事。我所藏的1913年2月初出的教育部编纂处月刊第一卷第一册上，便有以周树人署名的“拟播布美术意见书”；又同刊以后的几册上，还有鲁迅先生翻译日本人所作关于美术的文字。这也可见先生对于艺术爱好之专笃，几十年如一日。晚年他的首先提倡木刻，介绍西洋版画等，对中国艺术发展的贡献真是其功不可没。
    我忝长于鲁迅先生三岁。但先生以五十六岁之年遽归道山，却早为中国新文学奠定了基础，而二十年来，尤其是在先生毕生期冀的人民革命胜利之后，先生的数十册伟大遗著正发出万丈光芒，其将日益辉煌，更可预言。鲁迅先生的确是当得起称为精神不朽！而我却以老迈之年虽尚能健饭读书，终于碌碌无所表见，当此全国纪念鲁迅先生之时，倍觉自愧而又为鲁迅先生不寿痛惜。——在百感交集之下草草写出这一点往事的回忆，只为了略表我对于故人崇敬之意，因为那四十五年前朝夕趋部办公履进履退之诸同事，迄今已未再见一人了。
