    Israel's Armed Provocation Against Egypt

    Without stating any reason, Israeli troops suddenly launched an armed provocation against Egypt on October 29 and have invaded Egyptian territory. Simultaneously, the Israeli government announced a partial mobilization within the country. This Israeli act of armed aggression threatens the peace and security of Arab countries and further intensifies the tense situation in the Middle East.

    Since the Suez Canal issue arose, Israel's military provocations against Arab countries have become increasingly frequent, which is by no means accidental. Since September, Israel has continuously launched armed attacks on Jordan. Many subsequent facts have proven that these military provocations were entirely instigated by Britain and other Western colonial countries. The purpose was to try to undermine the unity among Arab countries, weaken Egypt's strong position on the Suez Canal issue due to the support of other Arab countries, and try to restore the colonial interests of Western countries in Jordan. Now Israel's unreasonable provocation against Egypt, many signs indicate, is also clearly instigated and directed by Western colonial countries. Before Israel launched this armed provocation, Western colonial countries conducted a series of suspicious activities in Israel. According to a report in the British newspaper on the 29th, Britain is planning to establish a military base in Israel to replace the lost Suez Canal base and the increasingly unstable Jordan base. "The New York Post" also reported that Israel will soon receive a loan of $75 million from the United States. The newspaper said that although this loan is nominally intended to supply Israel with general American goods, Israel can use this money to free up other funds to accelerate the purchase of urgently needed aircraft, tanks, artillery, and military supplies from countries such as Canada and France. Recently, Israel has been continuously receiving large quantities of military supplies and equipment from Western countries. Facts have proven that without the assistance and direction of Western colonial countries behind the scenes, Israel cannot and would never dare to act rashly.

    Britain and other Western colonial countries are delaying negotiations on the Suez Canal issue, but instigating Israel to launch an armed attack on Egypt. Their purpose is obviously also to weaken Egypt's position, exert pressure on Egypt and other Arab countries, divide the unity of Arab countries, and create a tense situation in the Middle East.

    However, this conspiracy of Western countries will never succeed. In the struggle to support Egypt in defending its sovereignty over the Suez Canal and in the struggle to support the Jordanian people in resisting Israeli aggression, Arab countries have long seen through this conspiracy. In their struggle against Western colonialism, they have not been divided but have become more united. Now, in order to resist Israel's aggression against Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt have announced that they will take joint measures. According to Syrian Prime Minister Sabri al-Asali on the 29th, the three Arab countries united by the tripartite military defense agreement, which is invoked when any one of the signatory countries is subjected to aggression, will jointly take similar measures to deal with Israel.

    Israel's armed provocation against Egypt is merely pulling chestnuts out of the fire for Britain and other Western countries, which is very unwise. Its actions will only benefit Western colonial countries and will not bring any benefit to the Israeli people. It will not only be resolutely countered by the united Arab countries, but also strongly condemned and opposed by peace-loving people all over the world.

### 以色列对埃及的武装挑衅

    以色列对埃及的武装挑衅
    以色列军队没有说明任何原因，突于10月29日发动了对埃及的武装挑衅，并且已经侵入埃及境内，同时，以色列政府还在国内宣布局部动员。以色列这一武装侵略行动，威胁着阿拉伯各国的和平和安全，进一步加剧了中东地区的紧张局势。
    自苏伊士运河问题发生以来，以色列对阿拉伯国家的军事挑衅越来越频繁，这决不是偶然的。从9月间起，以色列就不断地对约旦进行武装进攻。后来的许多事实已经证明：这种军事挑衅完全是英国和其他西方殖民国家所指使的。其目的是企图破坏阿拉伯国家之间的团结，削弱埃及在苏伊士运河问题上由于得到了其他阿拉伯国家的支持而拥有的强有力的地位，并力图恢复西方国家在约旦的殖民利益。现在以色列对埃及的无理挑衅，许多迹象表明显然也是受西方殖民国家的策动和指使。在以色列发动这次武装挑衅以前，西方殖民国家在以色列进行了一系列可疑的活动。据英国报纸29日报道，英国正在计划要在以色列建立军事基地，以代替已经失掉的苏伊士运河基地和日益不稳的约旦基地。“纽约邮报”也报道说，以色列将在最近从美国得到七千五百万美元的贷款。这家报纸说，这笔贷款虽然名义上是为了供给以色列购买美国的一般商品，但是以色列却由于有了这笔钱，就可以把其它款项抽出来，用来加速向加拿大和法国等国家购买急需的飞机、坦克、大炮和军火。最近，以色列正不断从西方国家得到大量的军火和军事装备。事实证明，没有西方殖民国家在背后援助和指使，以色列是不能也决不敢于轻举妄动。
    英国和其他西方殖民国家对苏伊士运河问题拖延不进行谈判，却唆使以色列向埃及发动武装进攻，其目的显然同样是想削弱埃及的地位，对埃及和其他阿拉伯国家施行压力，分裂阿拉伯国家的团结，并在中东制造紧张局势。
    但是，西方国家的这个阴谋是决不会成功的。阿拉伯国家在支持埃及维护自己对苏伊士运河主权的斗争中，在支持约旦人民抗击以色列侵略的斗争中，早就识破了这种阴谋。它们在反对西方殖民主义的斗争中，不但没有被分裂，而且更加团结一致了。现在，为了抵抗以色列对埃及的侵略行动，叙利亚、约旦和埃及已经宣布，它们即将采取共同措施。据叙利亚总理萨布里·阿萨利在29日说，以任何一个缔约的国家受到侵略时援用的三国军事防御协定联合起来的三个阿拉伯国家，将共同采取类似的措施对付以色列。
    以色列对埃及的武装挑衅行动，只是为英国和其它西方国家火中取栗，这是十分不明智的。它的这种行动，只会对西方殖民国家有利，绝不会给以色列人民带来任何一点利益。它不仅会遭到团结起来的阿拉伯国家的坚决还击，并且会遭到全世界爱好和平人民的强烈的指责和反对。
