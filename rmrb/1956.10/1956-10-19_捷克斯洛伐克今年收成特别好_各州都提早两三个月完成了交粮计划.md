Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 18th: The "Agricultural Newspaper" reported on the 17th that Czechoslovakia's grain harvest this year is particularly good, one of the highest levels ever achieved in grain production. All states have completed their grain procurement plans, two to three months earlier than last year.

According to preliminary reports, this year's spring barley yield averaged 2.06 metric tons per hectare, the second-highest yield ever achieved in Czechoslovakia's history. The yield of autumn rye was 1.94 metric tons per hectare, and the yield of autumn wheat was 2.06 metric tons per hectare. In the past thirty-five years, the unit area yield of these two crops is also considered very high this year.

The unit area yield obtained by the socialist sector in agriculture is much higher than the national average yield. It is worth noting that last year, the socialist sector provided 45.8% of the total national grain procurement, but this year it has reached 54.2%. Thus, the socialist sector has for the first time supplied more than half of the country's marketable grain.

    捷克斯洛伐克今年收成特别好
    各州都提早两三个月完成了交粮计划
    新华社布拉格18日电　“农业报”17日报道，捷克斯洛伐克今年的谷物收获量特别好，是谷物生产曾经达到过的最高水平之一。各州都完成了谷物的收购计划，并且比去年提早了两、三个月。
    根据初步报告，今年春大麦的产量平均每公顷达到二十点六公担，这是捷克斯洛伐克在历史上曾经达到过的第二次最高产量。秋黑麦的产量是每公顷十九点四公担，秋小麦产量是每公顷二十点六公担，在过去三十五年中，今年这两种作物的单位面积产量也算是很高的一次。
    农业中社会主义成分所获得的单位面积产量比全国平均产量高得多。值得注意的是，去年，社会主义成分提供了全国谷物收购总量的45.8％，但是今年已经达到了54.2％。这样，社会主义成分已经第一次供应了全国商品谷物的半数以上。
