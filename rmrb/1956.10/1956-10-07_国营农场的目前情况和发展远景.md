The Current Situation and Development Prospects of State-Owned Farms
Wang Zhen, Minister of Agricultural Reclamation

As early as the Anti-Japanese War period, in order to ensure supplies and reduce the burden on the people, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao called on the Party, government, army, and people in the base areas to launch a large-scale production movement. During the Liberation War, in the Northeast, land was reclaimed to establish farms in order to settle demobilized soldiers and captured Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers. The revolutionary troops of the Xinjiang ethnic groups also reclaimed wasteland for production while persisting in the struggle against the Kuomintang army. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, in order to heal the wounds of war and restore the national economy, more than thirty divisions were mobilized to participate in production and construction. Among them, the People's Liberation Army entering Xinjiang, after joining forces with the local people's army and the Kuomintang uprising army, immediately launched a labor production movement. In South China, several divisions of transferred troops organized reclamation bureaus to plant rubber and tropical cash crops. Before and after this, various provinces across the country also established some state-owned farms to develop agricultural production and play a demonstration role for farmers in collective management in order to solve the labor employment problems of demobilized soldiers and unemployed people. Thus, our large-scale state-owned agricultural and pastoral enterprises did not start from inheriting the legacy of landlords and the bourgeoisie, but relied on manpower, animal power, and old-fashioned agricultural tools to reclaim wasteland and develop.

In this way, we relied on demobilized officers and soldiers of the army (including many elderly, weak, and heroically disabled comrades), united all employees and professional and technical personnel, and after several years of hard work and difficult times, we have now turned part of the wilderness into fertile fields, built houses, and established homes. Today, many farms are already shaded by green trees, crisscrossed by canals, lined with orchards, and have herds of livestock. The fruits of this heroic labor have increasingly enhanced the socialist dedication of these demobilized officers and soldiers and farm workers, and have increasingly improved their material and cultural lives. At the same time, they are also increasingly attracting the vast number of young men and women across the country to participate in the reclamation of the frontier areas.

There are already 540 state-owned farms, most of which have reached high yields

At present, there are already 540 mechanized and semi-mechanized state-owned farms across the country, with a cultivated area of 15 million mu. Among them, most farms have achieved high yields. In 1955, the average yield per unit area of ​​grain on state-owned farms was about 10% higher than that of farmers across the country, and cotton was about 80% higher. In the large area of ​​more than 50,000 mu of cotton fields in the Manas River Military Reclamation Farm in Xinjiang, a high yield of 400 jin of seed cotton per mu was achieved. The Jiusan Rongjun Farm in Heilongjiang Province yielded an average of 416.8 jin of spring wheat per mu on more than 1,000 mu of land. Most farms have supplied farmers with improved seeds and breeding livestock, and are playing a demonstration role for agricultural cooperatives. On the other hand, it should be pointed out that some farms have poor management, low yields, and still have supply system thinking. The economic accounting system has not been established, and the lives of employees have not been improved as they should be. These serious shortcomings must be overcome with efforts.

The "Friendship Farm" presented by the great Soviet Union with mechanical equipment and dispatched experts to help us build, and the "Sino-Czech Friendship Farm" presented by Czechoslovakia with mechanical equipment and dispatched experts are being built, both of which will become models for our country's state-owned farms to learn from. Here, on behalf of the employees of the state-owned farms, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the governments and people of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia.

In the Second Five-Year Plan, 35 million mu of cultivated land will be reclaimed

The First Five-Year Plan stipulates that 7.58 million mu of cultivated land should be reclaimed by state-owned mechanized farms, which can be completed this year. Together with military reclamation farms, it will reach 15 million mu this year. By 1957, it can reach a total of 25 million mu. In the Second Five-Year Plan, 35 million mu of cultivated land will be reclaimed. After this plan is completed, the cultivated land of state-owned farms in my country will reach a total of 60 million mu.

In order to complete the above-mentioned land reclamation tasks, we plan to focus on Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, and South China, and will develop large-scale agricultural and pastoral economies based on the characteristics of these regions, operate different specialties, and produce industrial raw materials and export commodities.

Although the investment in water conservancy projects in the Xinjiang region is large, due to the superior conditions for cotton planting and the experience in cotton planting, the cotton yield is very high and harvests are guaranteed every year. If, by 1962, the cotton fields of the Xinjiang Military Reclamation State-owned Farms and the local State-owned Farms increase to 4 million mu, with an output of 120 jin of lint cotton per mu, then 4.8 million dan of cotton can be produced in one year, equivalent to 10% of the country's total output in the same year.

If the cultivated area of ​​state-owned farms and railway soldier farms in Heilongjiang Province reaches 33 million mu during the Second Five-Year Plan period, it can strive to produce 4.5 million tons of soybeans during the Second Five-Year Plan period (cumulative number for five years), equivalent to half of the country's soybean exports during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

After suffering from the worst frost damage in a century in 1954, the rubber plantations of the South China Reclamation Bureau have gradually recovered. Guangdong (including Hainan Island), Guangxi, and Yunnan have good conditions for planting rubber and tropical specialty beverages and spice crops. Therefore, it is necessary to actively develop diversified operations with tropical and subtropical crops as the main focus.

Strengthen the demonstration role of local state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms for local agricultural production cooperatives

Local state-owned farms in various provinces and regions must also take the Agricultural Development Program (Draft) as a guide and carry out diversified operations in accordance with local conditions. On the one hand, they should learn farming methods from local agricultural cooperatives, and on the other hand, they should supply local agricultural cooperatives with improved seeds, breeding livestock, and oilseed trees and fruit tree seedlings that have been proven and technically appraised, promote effective technical measures in the local area, and provide experience in operation and management. For this purpose, we should give due attention to the allocation of investment and the allocation of technical talents to various local state-owned farms. At the same time, we should implement the policy of running farms diligently and thriftily, give full play to the labor efficiency of manpower and animal power, and make the state-owned farms in various places truly play a demonstration role for local agricultural cooperatives.

State-owned farms are the highest form of socialist agricultural production organization, and are large agricultural and pastoral enterprises that produce various agricultural products. State-owned farms in my country are currently in the initial stage of development, and the proportion of their cultivated area and output in the national cultivated area and agricultural output is still small. However, due to my country's large population, with an average of only more than three mu of cultivated land per person, and due to my country's vast territory and mild climate, there is a large amount of land that can be reclaimed throughout the country, especially in the border areas; therefore, it is necessary and possible for us to gradually develop more state-owned farms, reclaim more wasteland, and produce more agricultural and pastoral products to meet the needs of people's lives and foreign exports. Therefore, we must give full play to the production potential of existing farms, strengthen scientific and technological guidance, increase the yield per unit area, further reduce production costs, accumulate experience, train cadres, and do a good job in wasteland surveying, soil surveys, water conservancy surveys, and planning and design, so as to create favorable conditions and make full preparations for larger-scale land reclamation in the Third Five-Year Plan. I believe that all comrades engaged in agricultural reclamation will be inspired by the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, and will fulfill the tasks given to them by the Party and the country with full confidence, so that state-owned agricultural and pastoral enterprises will be further developed.

    国营农场的目前情况和发展远景
    农垦部部长　王震
    早在抗日战争时期，为了保证供给，减轻人民负担，党中央和毛主席号召各根据地的党政军民学开展了大生产运动。解放战争期间，在东北，为了安置复员军人和被俘的蒋军官兵，曾开垦荒地建立农场。新疆民族的革命部队，在坚持反对国民党军的斗争中，也曾经开荒生产。中华人民共和国成立以后，为了医治战争创伤，恢复国民经济，又动员了三十多个师参加生产建设。其中进入新疆的人民解放军在同本地人民军队及国民党起义军队会合以后，立即展开了劳动生产运动。在华南有几个师的转业部队，组织了垦殖局，种植橡胶和热带经济作物。在此前后，全国各省为了解决复员军人和失业人员的劳动就业问题，也都建立了一些国营农场，发展农业生产，并且向农民起集体经营的示范作用。由此可见，我们的国营大农牧企业，不是从接受地主资产阶级的遗产开始，而是依靠人力、畜力和旧式农具开垦荒地发展起来的。
    就是这样，我们依靠军队的复员官兵（其中包括许多年老体弱和英勇战斗残废了的同志），团结了全体职工和专业技术人员，经过几年的辛勤劳动，熬过了几年的艰苦困难，现在已经把一部分荒野变成了良田，盖起了房舍，建立了家园。今天，许多农场已经是绿树成荫，水渠纵横，果木成林，家畜成群了。这种豪迈劳动的成果，已经日益提高这些复员官兵和农场职工的社会主义事业心，日益提高他们的物质文化生活，同时，也正在日益吸引全国广大的青年男女，来参加边疆地区的垦荒事业。
    已有五百四十个国营农场，其中大多数已达到了高额的产量
    现在，全国已经有五百四十个机械化和半机械化的国营农场，耕地面积达到一千五百万亩。其中，大多数农场已经达到了高额的产量，一九五五年国营农场的粮食平均单位面积产量高于全国农民的百分之十左右，棉花高百分之八十左右。在新疆玛纳斯河军垦农场五万多亩棉田的大面积上，每亩达到了四百斤籽棉的丰产。黑龙江省的九三荣军农场，在一千多亩地上，平均每亩产春小麦四百一十六点八斤。大多数农场给农民供给了优良的种籽和种畜，对农业合作社正起着示范作用。另一方面，应该指出，有些农场，经营管理不善，产量很低，还存在着供给制思想，经济核算制度没有建立起来，职工的生活也没有得到应有的改善。这些严重缺点，必须努力克服。
    伟大苏联赠送机械装备并且派遣专家帮助我们建成的“友谊农场”和捷克斯洛伐克赠送机械设备和派遣专家正在建立的“中捷友谊农场”，它们都将成为我国国营农场树立学习的榜样。在此，我代表国营农场的职工谨向苏联和捷克斯洛伐克的政府和人民，表示衷心的感谢。
    第二个五年计划中，将开垦耕地三千五百万亩
    第一个五年计划规定国营机械化农场的开垦耕地七百五十八万亩，今年就可以完成，连军垦农场今年将共达到一千五百万亩。到一九五七年可共达到二千五百万亩。在第二个五年计划中，将开垦耕地三千五百万亩，这个计划完成后，我国国营农场的耕地将共达六千万亩。
    为着完成上述开荒任务，我们计划以新疆、黑龙江和华南为重点，并且将根据这些地区的特点，发展大农牧业经济，经营不同的特产，生产工业原料和出口商品。
    新疆地区的开垦，虽然水利工程投资大，但由于有着植棉的优越条件，已经有了植棉的经验，棉田的产量很高，年年保收。如果到一九六二年新疆军垦国营农场和地方国营农场的棉田增加到四百万亩，每亩以产皮棉一百二十斤计，那末，一年就即可以产棉花四百八十万担。相当于全国同年总产量的百分之十。
    黑龙江省国营农场和铁道兵农场，如果在第二个五年计划期间，耕地面积达到三千三百万亩，就可以争取第二个五年计划期间生产大豆四百五十万吨（五年累计数），相当国家在第二个五年计划期间出口大豆的一半。
    华南垦殖局的橡胶园，遭受一九五四年百年未有的大冻害以后，现在已经逐渐恢复，广东（包括海南岛）、广西、云南都有种植橡胶和热带特产饮料、香料作物的好条件。因此应该积极发展以热带亚热带的作物为主的多种经营。
     加强地方国营农牧场对当地农业生产合作社的示范作用
    各省、区的地方国营农场也必须以农业发展纲要（草案）为指针，因地制宜地进行多种经营，一方面，向当地农业合作社学习耕作方法，另一方面又给当地农业合作社供给已经证明并且经过技术鉴定的优良种籽、种畜和油籽树、果树苗，推广当地行之有效的技术措施，提供经营管理的经验，为此目的，我们对于各个地方国营农场的投资的分配和技术人材的配备，应当给以应有的注意。同时，应当贯彻执行勤俭办场的方针，充分发挥人力、畜力的劳动效率，使各地的国营农场对于当地农业合作社真正起示范作用。
    国营农场是社会主义农业生产组织的最高形式，是生产各种农产品的大农牧业企业。我国的国营农场目前还处在初步发展的阶段，它的耕地面积和产量在全国耕地面积和农业产量中所占的比重都还小。但是，由于我国人口众多，每人平均只有三亩多耕地，又由于我国幅员广大气候温和，全国各地特别在边疆有着大量的土地可以开垦；所以我们有必要也有可能逐步地发展更多的国营农场，开垦更多的荒地，生产更多的农牧产品，以供应人民生活和对外出口的需要。因此，我们必须充分发挥现有农场的生产潜力，加强科学技术指导，提高单位面积产量，进一步降低生产成本，积累经验，培养干部，并且做好荒地勘测、土壤调查、水利勘测和规划设计工作，为第三个五年计划更大规模的开荒创造有利的条件作好充分的准备。我相信全体从事于农垦事业的同志，在党的第八次全国代表大会的精神的鼓舞下，将满怀信心地完成党和国家给予自己的任务，使国营农牧企业进一步地发展起来。
