    Conducting Sports Activities in Cadre Schools

    Our country has many Party schools and various cadre schools, training professional cadres and leading backbones for the Party and the state's various undertakings. However, these schools do not have physical education classes, and there are very few full-time sports cadres. There is only one hour of recreational sports activities every afternoon, as well as morning exercises and work break exercises. Most students do not have the habit of engaging in sports activities. It is very important to actively carry out sports activities in Party schools and cadre schools. It can ensure that students complete their study tasks; at the same time, it can enable students to develop good habits of engaging in regular physical exercise while in school.

    The Physical Culture and Sports Commission has always been indifferent to the sports work of Party schools and cadre schools. For example, when Lanzhou City held school basketball and volleyball games this year, it did not notify the Party school; when it held the agency basketball and volleyball games, it said that the Party school was not an agency and would not allow it to participate. The Physical Culture and Sports Commission did not allow the Party school to participate in relevant meetings, nor did it convey the content of the meetings to the Party school afterward. There was even less of a share for the Party school in organizing the study of relevant documents and visits. The Party school is not under the leadership of the Higher Education Department, nor is it under the leadership of the Ministry of Education, so the instructions and documents related to sports work from the education departments are not sent to the Party school.

    I suggest that the relevant leadership departments formulate an outline for sports work in Party schools at all levels based on the national sports work guidelines, tasks, and the specific circumstances of the Party schools, and hand it over to each school for implementation or reference and trial implementation; the Physical Culture and Sports Commission should include the sports work of Party schools in its work plan, and relevant activities should take Party schools into account as much as possible; the relevant leadership departments should set up institutions to manage sports work and conduct regular guidance, supervision, and inspection of sports work in Party schools at all levels.

    In addition, we must not only carry out mass sports activities but also hand over sports work to the masses, that is, publicize the plans, systems, methods, and standards of sports work so that everyone knows and can do it. For example, for swimming, on the one hand, the Physical Culture and Sports Commission can build swimming pools in various places, and on the other hand, it can also lead the masses to use natural rivers and streams, as long as the methods are handed over to the masses, they can do it themselves. Another example is radio, a project in national defense sports. At present, there are many people who love it and a lot of equipment. As long as methods are given and appropriate guidance is provided, the masses can voluntarily combine and form groups to carry out activities.

    The development of sports activities should pay attention to adapting to local conditions. For example, engage in water sports on the coast, ice sports in cold regions, and horse riding and archery in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and other places. The Northwest has many mountains, making mountain climbing very convenient. The Physical Culture and Sports Commission should consider making full use of these favorable conditions.

    At present, sports work is developing rapidly, but there are few cadres and their professional skills are poor. It is very important to summarize and promote advanced experiences in a timely manner. These experiences should also be introduced to the broad masses of people.

    在干部学校中开展体育活动
    我国有不少党校和各种干部学校，为党和国家培养各项事业的专业干部和领导骨干。但这些学校都没有体育课，专职体育干部也很少，只有每天下午一小时的文娱体育活动和早操、工间操，每年举行一、二次运动会。多数学员没有从事体育运动的习惯。积极开展党校和干部学校的体育运动是很重要的。它可以保证学员完成学习任务；同时，可以使学员们在学校中养成经常从事体育锻炼的良好习惯。
    体育运动委员会对于党校和干部学校的体育工作一向是漠不关心的。例如今年兰州市举办学校篮、排球赛时就没有通知党校；举办机关篮、排球赛时又说党校不是机关，不让参加。体委召开的有关会议既不让党校参加，会后也不向党校传达。组织有关文件的学习、参观等，更没有党校的份。党校不属高等教育部领导，也不属教育部领导，教育部门有关体育工作的指示、文件就发不到党校来。
    我建议：有关领导方面根据全国体育工作的方针、任务和党校的具体情况，制定各级党校体育工作大纲，交各校执行或参考试行；体委应当把党校的体育工作列入工作规划，有关的活动，应当尽可能照顾到党校；有关领导方面要设置管理体育工作的机构，对各级党校的体育工作进行经常的指导、督促和检查。
    另外，我们既要开展群众性的体育运动，就应该把体育工作交给群众，即把体育工作的规划、制度、办法、标准等公布出来，让大家知道，让大家去办。如游泳运动，一方面体委可以在各地修建游泳池，一方面也可以领导群众利用天然江河水流，只要把办法交给群众，群众就可自办。又如国防体育中的无线电这个项目，目前爱好的人和器材都不少，只要交给办法，适当加以指导，群众就可自愿结合，组成小组，进行活动。
    开展体育运动应注意因地制宜。如在沿海搞水上运动，在寒冷地带搞冰上运动，在内蒙古自治区等地搞骑马、射箭运动。西北多山，搞爬山运动很方便。对于这些优越条件，体委应当考虑加以充分利用。
    目前体育工作发展很快，干部少，业务能力差，及时总结和推广先进经验很重要。这些经验还应该介绍到广大群众中去。
