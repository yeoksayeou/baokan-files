Xinhua News Agency, October 9th, Cairo Dispatch: Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser has advocated for the establishment of an economic organization by Asian and African countries "so that Asian and African countries can shatter the Western conspiracies against their economies and overcome the obstacles created by imperialist banks."

    According to the "Al-Ahram" newspaper on October 8th, Nasser said in an interview with a reporter from the Ceylon "Gall" magazine: "The imperialist countries' intentions towards Asian and African countries have been exposed. We must rely on ourselves, because it is useless to rely on Western assistance. The aid proposals that the West has made to us in the past four years have all been conditional. When we rejected the conditions that would infringe upon our sovereignty, the West withdrew its proposal to finance the Aswan Dam."

    Nasser said that the World Bank is "a tool controlled by the United States, Britain, and France to achieve their political goals."

    When discussing the Suez Canal issue, Nasser said that what the West is really concerned about is not freedom of navigation, but "to suppress the rising tide of Arab nationalism and implement Western strategic plans in military planning, especially to implement the Baghdad Pact, which aims to restore the era of imperialism."

    He said that Egypt "has enough strength to resist any imperialist aggression against Egypt." He also said: "We will not attack anyone, but we will resist aggression."

    Nasser expressed regret over Iran and Ethiopia's support for the West on the Suez issue.

    纳赛尔主张亚非国家应成立经济组织
    据新华社9日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔主张亚非国家成立一个经济组织，“以便使亚非国家能够粉碎西方对它们的经济所进行的阴谋和克服帝国主义银行所造成的障碍”。
    据“晚报”10月8日刊载，纳赛尔在接见锡兰“加尔”杂志记者的谈话中说：“帝国主义国家对亚非国家的企图已经被揭露了，我们必须依靠自己，因为要依靠西方的帮助是没有用的。西方在过去四年间对我们提出的援助建议都是有附带条件的。当我们拒绝那些会侵犯我们的主权的条件的时候，西方就收回了资助阿斯旺水坝的建议。”
    纳赛尔说世界银行是“掌握在美国、英国和法国手中的实现它们的政治目的的工具”。
    纳赛尔在谈到关于苏伊士运河问题的时候说：西方所关心的并非真的是航行自由，而是“压制阿拉伯的日益高涨的民族主义力量，在军事计划方面执行西方的战略计划，特别是执行目的在于恢复帝国主义时代的巴格达条约”。
    他说，埃及“有足够的力量抵御帝国主义对埃及的任何侵略”。他还说：“我们不会进攻任何人，但是我们将抵抗侵略。”
    纳赛尔对伊朗和埃塞俄比亚在苏伊士问题上支持西方表示遗憾。
