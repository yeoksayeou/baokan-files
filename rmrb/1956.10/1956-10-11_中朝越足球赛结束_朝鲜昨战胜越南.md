Xinhua News Agency, October 10th. The football tournament among China, North Korea, and Vietnam held in Beijing concluded today. The football team of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea defeated the football team of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by a score of 3-0 in the final match this afternoon.

This friendly tournament among the three countries adopted a round-robin system. In the three round-robin matches, the North Korean team defeated the Chinese team and the Vietnamese team; the Chinese team defeated the Vietnamese team but lost to the North Korean team; and the Vietnamese team lost to both the Chinese team and the North Korean team.

In today's match, both the North Korean and Vietnamese teams adopted proactive and aggressive tactics. In the first twenty minutes of the first half, the players of both teams engaged in fierce battles near the midfield, resulting in fewer shooting opportunities. In the latter twenty minutes of the first half, the taller and faster North Korean players gradually gained the upper hand, launching several attacks on the Vietnamese goal. However, due to the strikers' lack of steadiness, many shots missed the target.

At the beginning of the second half, the North Korean team launched a series of rapid and comprehensive offensives, scoring three consecutive goals between the fifth and twenty-fifth minutes.

    中朝越足球赛结束
    朝鲜昨战胜越南
    据新华社10日讯　在北京举行的中国、朝鲜、越南三国足球比赛今天结束。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国足球队今天下午在最后一场比赛中，以三比○战胜了越南民主共和国足球队。
    这次三国友谊比赛采取循环制。在三场循环比赛中，朝鲜队战胜了中国队和越南队；中国队胜越南队败于朝鲜队；越南队败于中国队和朝鲜队。
    在今天这场比赛中，朝鲜队和越南队都采取了主动、积极的战术。上半场的前二十分钟，两队队员在中场附近展开激烈的争夺战，因而都没有得到较多的射门机会。在上半场的后二十分钟里，身材高大、速度快的朝鲜队队员渐渐占了优势，数次围攻越南队的大门。但是，由于前锋踢得不够稳，许多次射门都没有射中。
    下半场一开始，朝鲜队就接连发动了快速的、全面的进攻，在五分钟到二十五分钟时，连续踢进了三个球。
