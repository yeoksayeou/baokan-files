    Who Can Work Twenty-Four Hours?
    In the first half of this year, the Ministry of Communications, Maritime Transport Bureau, issued a notice to all regional maritime transport bureaus: to insist on 24-hour work for all maritime radio stations without increasing personnel. The navigation of sea vessels relies on radio communications to request instructions and report maritime navigation conditions, thereby determining the vessel's movements. It is very necessary for maritime radio stations to work day and night. However, what is the personnel situation of each maritime radio station? The shore stations of the South China Sea Transport Bureau have only two or three people managing one circuit, and the vast majority of ship stations have only one person working. May I ask: how can one person persist in working twenty-four hours? Even with two people, working twelve hours a day, how long can they last? Currently, among the radiotelegraphers in the South China communication system, many suffer from neurasthenia, lung disease, or stomach problems due to long-term lack of sufficient rest.
    I don't understand when the Ministry of Communications, Maritime Transport Bureau made the decision not to increase personnel, did they not know the situation of the radiotelegraphers at all, or did they simply not care about our health?　Bu Yi

    谁能工作二十四小时？
    今年上半年，交通部海运总局给各区海运局下了一个通知：要各航务电台在不增加人的原则下，坚持二十四小时工作。海船的航行，要依靠无线电通讯来请示与报道海上航行情况，从而决定船舶的行止。航务电台要夜以继日地工作是很必要的。但是，各航务电台人员的情况是怎样呢？华南区海运局岸台只有二人或三人管一条电路，船台上绝大部分是一人工作。请问：一个人怎样坚持二十四小时工作？即使是二个人吧，每天工作十二小时，又能坚持多久？现在，华南区通讯系统报务员中，由于长期以来得不到充分的休息，许多人都患有神经衰弱、或肺病、胃病。
    我不明白交通部海运总局作不增加人的决定的时候，是根本不知道报务员的情况呢，还是根本没把我们的健康情况放在心里？　部一
