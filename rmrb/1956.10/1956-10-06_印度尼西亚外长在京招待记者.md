Xinhua News Agency, 5th - Indonesian Foreign Minister Abdoelgani said today that during President Sukarno's visit to Beijing, top-level figures exchanged views on international issues, particularly the relationship between China and Indonesia.
　　The Foreign Minister told more than sixty Chinese and foreign reporters at a press conference this afternoon that the talks were conducted in "an atmosphere of sincerity and understanding."
　　Abdoelgani said, "My government sees more possibilities to promote further development in economic and other areas between the two sides." He said, "My government may have some differences with your government in terms of views, opinions, and ideologies, but the relations between the two sides have been established on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. These principles were later affirmed at the Bandung Conference."
　　When talking about his impression of China, he said, "I have seen much progress, and we have seen here the efforts made to build a new society." He said, "For a long time, China has been misunderstood."
　　In response to a question about the submission of the Suez Canal issue to the Security Council, Abdoelgani said, "This development is a favorable development." Earlier, there had been a tense situation regarding the Suez Canal issue. He said, "Regardless of whether the current composition of the Security Council is satisfactory, it is, in any case, a conference table."
　　The Foreign Minister said, "If the Security Council cannot find a solution, Indonesia hopes to discuss the issue on a broader negotiation basis. There are certainly many possibilities regarding this. For example, the United Nations General Assembly, a committee outside the United Nations, or another conference."
　　Abdoelgani held a "pessimistic" view of the "unilateral" Suez Canal Users Association. He said, "In my view, the countries using the Suez Canal are not limited to those who supported the US plan in London." "If a portion of the users organize an association, then many other users can also organize a users association based on the same peaceful and equal rights."
　　The Foreign Minister said that especially Egypt is excluded from the association, while this canal is destined to be in Egypt, and I think that is the biggest weakness of this association.
　　When talking about his impressions of accompanying President Sukarno on visits to some countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, Abdoelgani said, "We believe that people are increasingly feeling the need to ease tensions." "The estrangement is now disappearing, but not as quickly as we would like. I think we must never be passive; we must be proactive." He said, "We visit everywhere with the intention of playing the role of a bridge builder—a bridge of understanding, not a bridge of steel." He said with satisfaction that as bridge builders, they were welcomed by heads of state everywhere, "and finally, and equally enthusiastically, welcomed in Beijing."
　　The Foreign Minister told a reporter who raised a question that Indonesia's east is frequently harassed, and it comes from behind the scenes in West Irian. He dared not say whether the Netherlands would try to use West Irian as a base for future conquest of Indonesia. He said, "If they try to do so, we will be ready to respond." He said the problem is not in this aspect. "The problem is that West New Guinea is part of the Netherlands East Indies and it was agreed that it would become the territory of the Republic of Indonesia." He said that the Netherlands has not returned it to Indonesia, which is "legally a violation of the promise."
　　When someone asked the Foreign Minister to comment on the Netherlands' protest against Indonesia's abolition of debts, Abdoelgani said that part of the debt was used to pay for the military actions taken by the Netherlands against Indonesians. He said, "We cannot agree to pay for the price of a knife stabbing us in the back."
　　Abdoelgani further explained Indonesia's abolition of the Round Table Conference agreements, saying, "The Dutch have consistently violated the Round Table Conference agreements." He said, when they violate all the agreements, why should Indonesia stand aside politely?
　　When talking about Indonesia's current Five-Year Plan, Foreign Minister Abdoelgani said that the basis of the Five-Year Plan is to provide the people with more food, replace tattered clothes with good clothes, and provide housing. Around these basic needs, we will develop our industry. We will gradually change our country's colonial economy into a national economy step by step in accordance with the law. This is the main line of the policy to get rid of colonial influences.

    印度尼西亚外长在京招待记者
    新华社5日讯　印度尼西亚外交部长阿卜杜加尼今天说，在苏加诺总统访问北京期间，最高一级人士已经就国际问题，特别是中国和印度尼西亚的关系问题交换了意见。
    这位外交部长在今天下午举行的记者招待会上，对六十多位中国和外国记者说，会谈是在“诚恳和谅解的气氛中”进行的。
    阿卜杜加尼说，“我的政府看到有更多的可能来促进双方在经济和其他方面的进一步发展。”他说，
  “我的政府可能同你们的政府在某些看法、意见和观念形态方面有所不同，但是双方关系已经在和平共处的五项原则的基础上建立起来。这些原则后来在万隆会议上得到肯定。”
    他在谈到他对中国的印象的时候说，“我看到了许多进步，我们已经在这里看到为建设一个新社会所作的努力。”他说，“长时期以来，中国一直是被人误解了。”
    阿卜杜加尼在回答关于苏伊士运河问题被提交安全理事会一事的时候说，“这个发展是一个有利的发展。”而在早些时候，关于苏伊士运河问题曾经有过剑拔弩张的情况。他说，“不论安全理事会现在的组成是否令人满意，它无论如何总是一个会议桌。”
    这位外交部长说：“如果安全理事会不能找到一个解决办法，印度尼西亚希望在更广泛的谈判基础上讨论这个问题。关于这一点当然是有许多可能性的。例如联合国大会，例如联合国以外的一个委员会；又例如另外一个会议。”
    阿卜杜加尼对“单方面的”苏伊士运河使用国协会抱“悲观的”看法。他说，“按照我的看法，使用苏伊士运河的国家并不限于那些在伦敦支持美国方案的国家。”“假如一部分使用国组织一个协会，那末还有许多其他使用国也可以根据同样的和平等的权利组织一个使用国协会。”
    这位外交部长说，特别是埃及被排斥在协会以外，而这条运河天定的是在埃及，我想这就是这个协会最大的弱点。
    阿卜杜加尼在谈到关于他陪同苏加诺总统到亚洲、欧洲和美洲一些国家访问的印象的时候说：“我们认为，人们是愈来愈感到必须缓和紧张局势了。”“隔膜现在正在消失，但是还没有消失得像我们所希望的那么快。我认为，我们决不可被动；我们必须主动。”他说，“我们到处访问，是想起到造桥人的作用，——这种桥是谅解的桥，而不是钢桥的桥。”他表示很满意地说，作为造桥人，他们到处受到国家负责人的欢迎，“最后，而且同样热情地在北京受到欢迎。”
    外交部长告诉一位提出问题的记者说，印度尼西亚的东方经常发生骚扰，它是来自西伊里安幕后。他不敢说，荷兰会不会试图把西伊里安用作将来征服印度尼西亚的基地，他说，“如果他们试图这样做，我们将随时准备给以回答。”他说，问题不在这方面。“问题在于西新畿内亚是荷属东印度群岛的一部分，而且说定了要成为印度尼西亚共和国的领土。”他说，荷兰没有把它归还给印度尼西亚，这“在法律上违背了诺言。”
    有人要求外交部长对荷兰抗议印度尼西亚废除债务发表意见，阿卜杜加尼说，其中一部分债务是用来支付荷兰对印度尼西亚人所采取的军事行动的费用的。他说，“我们不能同意支付从背后刺我们的刀子的价钱。”
    阿卜杜加尼在进一步解释印度尼西亚废除圆桌会议协定的时候说，“荷兰人一贯地违反了圆桌会议协定。”他说，在他们违反所有的协定的时候，为什么印度尼西亚应该客客气气地站在一边呢？
    在谈到目前印度尼西亚的五年计划时，外交部长阿卜杜加尼说，这个五年计划的基础是为人民提供更多的食物，把破旧的衣服换成好衣服和提供房屋。围绕着这些基本的需要，我们将发展我们的工业。我们将按照法律一步一步地逐渐改变我国的殖民地经济为民族经济。这就是摆脱殖民主义影响的政策的主要路线。
