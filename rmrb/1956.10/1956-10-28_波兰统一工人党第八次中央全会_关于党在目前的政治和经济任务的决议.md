Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 27th: Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party regarding the Party's current political and economic tasks.

The Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, agreeing with the political line put forward in Comrade Gomulka-Wiesław's speech, passes the following resolution:

Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party Regarding the Party's Current Political and Economic Tasks.

(I)

I. The Central Committee declares that the decisive task for the further development of Poland on the road to socialism lies in consolidating the leading role of our Party as the political and ideological guiding force of the working class, the Polish people, and the people's state.

Only when the Party resolutely and unhesitatingly practices the correct line put forward by the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee—the line of systematically improving the living conditions of the working people in urban and rural areas, and implementing profound socialist democratization—can the Party realize its leading role.

The main obstacle that prevented the implementation of the correct resolutions passed by the Seventh Plenary Session was the lack of unity and consistency within the Political Bureau of the Central Committee in resolving concrete problems in the process of socialist democratization within the Party and the country. In this situation, the activities of the Central Committee were often paralyzed, which weakened the Party's leadership role in the rapidly increasing political activism of the masses.

The Party must lead all advanced socialist forces among the working class and the entire nation to strive to overcome the remnants, errors, and deviations of the past period, in order to eliminate inevitable temporary difficulties and obstacles, defeat the conspiracies of reactionary forces, and carry this effort through to the end.

The Party must constantly overcome conservatism and a timid style of work within its ranks; it must overcome the fear of new things and the clinging to outdated theories and old methods, as well as attempts to turn back the clock and restore old management and governance methods—methods characterized by Stalinist deviations and domestic characteristics.

Only in this way can we overcome chaos and passivity; only in this way can we mobilize and unite the Party ranks. Only in this way can we give correct guidance to the efforts of those who sometimes make mistakes but are nevertheless dedicated to the cause of socialism.

Only in this way can we overcome the erroneous bourgeois liberal tendencies among vacillators, especially among some intellectuals.

Only in this way can we isolate reactionary forces—which are intensifying their activities, attempting to intensify class struggle, and trying to use the democratization of our political life to oppose socialism, thereby opposing democracy, and to provoke relations between Poland and the Soviet Union—and prevent them from doing harm.

In the struggle against conservative forces, against attempts to turn back the clock and prevent the development of democracy within the Party and suppress criticism, against the undermining of the rule of law and the re-justification of bureaucracy, the re-implementation of tyrannical methods, and double-dealing schemes, the Party will unite and lead all healthy socialist forces.

The Party must lead the advanced workers' movement aimed at improving economic methods and increasing opportunities for the working class to directly participate in the management of socialist enterprises and the governance of the state, lead peasants in developing autonomy, strengthen democratic institutions and the power of people's councils, and increase agricultural output, and lead the unprecedentedly active socialist intellectual movement among intellectuals.

The Party will help the Polish Youth League and Polish youth realize their ardent desire to participate in the political life of the country to the greatest extent, help them conduct ideological and organizational work, so that the advanced part of the youth can establish closer ties with the Party and increase the Party's influence on the entire younger generation.

In the struggle to realize socialist democratization, the Party will strengthen its cooperative relations with friendly parties, namely the United Peasant Party and the Democratic Party, in order to consolidate the political core of the National Front.

II. The Party cannot tolerate lip service and formal obedience to the Party's resolutions, nor can it tolerate comrades in responsible positions who refuse to actively and resolutely implement these resolutions.

The Party must guarantee the conditions necessary for intra-party democracy—the Party's life must be open, a condition that has not been strictly maintained in the past; in particular, the Party must ensure that members are regularly informed of the Party leadership's attitude towards current issues in Party policy, ensure that members' questions and requests are answered, and ensure that Party organs systematically report to the masses of members who elected them.

The Party will pay special attention to ensuring the conditions for free elections of Party organs in all Party organizations—from the most basic to the highest—according to the Party Constitution, guaranteeing that nominations for Party organs can be made without hindrance, that various nominations can be freely discussed, and that elections are secret—this includes not only Party committees, but also executive bodies and secretaries, including the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and the Secretariat of the Central Committee.

In order to correctly select the personnel of Party organs, and to increase their responsibility to Party organizations, it is necessary to adopt the principle that responsible personnel of Party organs should be elected at the plenary sessions of Party organizations. According to the resolution of the Seventh Plenary Session, the Party should intensify the simplification of organs, change the working style of Party organs, and ensure that the allocation and use of Party cadres are sufficient to strengthen the activities of grassroots Party organizations in factories and institutions, especially in large factories.

The unity and solidarity of the Party ranks is the cornerstone of the Party's strength and a condition for its effective work. While members freely discuss and exchange views on Party policy issues, it is necessary to strictly and unconditionally adhere to discipline to carry out Party tasks from the moment a decision is made. The Party will never tolerate any behavior that weakens Party discipline or evades the execution of tasks assigned by Party decisions and regulations.

The unity of Party action is only possible on the basis of the unity of thought of communists and on the basis of the principles of creative Marxism-Leninism. We must boldly correct past errors and deviations in thought and practice, and strengthen the unity of Party action by conducting principled criticism of views that do not conform to the Party's line, based on the Leninist standpoint and the Party's programmatic principles.

The unity of Party thought and the unity of Party ranks does not mean that members cannot have differing opinions on the decisions of Party organizations. The Party adheres to the Leninist view that, within the scope of the Party program, it is permissible and inevitable for members to hold differing opinions on various issues of the Party's daily activities. Members with different views can maintain their views and can present their views to the organizations to which they belong or to higher Party organizations, but they cannot resort to public opinion outside the Party in violation of the Party's views. In their practical activities, they must unconditionally implement the Party's decisions.

The Party believes that Party organizations cannot use disciplinary measures to force members to abandon their different opinions. However, within the Party, there is no place for those who hold opinions that violate the Party's program principles or whose practical activities are harmful to these principles.

The Party condemns the view and method of dividing artificial boundaries in the Party ranks according to national origin, and condemns the practice of discriminating against certain parts of the population because of their origin, which fosters anti-Semitism and all nationalistic tendencies that are incompatible with the Party's ideology and corrupt the morals of Party cadres. In the Party's personnel policy, we should consider the following principles: the political and professional conditions of comrades, their views, ideological maturity and moral character, their connection with the masses, and their selflessness in the struggle for the cause of the working class and the working people.

The Party opposes all attempts to create discord between the working class and intellectuals—underestimating the leading role of the working class and underestimating the importance of the role of intellectuals in establishing a new system and in developing the country's economic and cultural undertakings. The wavering shown by some intellectuals cannot be used as an excuse to distrust the progressive intellectual movement among intellectuals. The unity of this movement and the working class is stronger than ever.

The current stage is characterized by the restoration of Leninist principles in the workers' movement, the great awakening of revolutionary thought, and the struggle against extraneous excrescences and distortions in theory and practice. In this stage, it is necessary to concentrate the Party's strength on the ideological front in order to determine the Party's attitude towards current ideological issues, lead the domestic intellectual movement, and deal with confusion and hostile ideological manifestations.

III. The Party believes that the principle that Party and state leaders should be responsible for the tasks and responsibilities entrusted to them must be fully restored as one of the basic principles of socialist democracy. Although this principle was formally recognized in the past, it was violated in practice. Those who have lost prestige in their activities due to stupidity or serious mistakes, and those who cannot correct their mistakes, must not continue to remain in responsible positions.

In order to powerfully re-clarify this view, the Party opposes lowering the prestige in the public eye of those loyal leaders who are dedicated to the cause of socialism and who make up the vast majority of our country's and Party's organs—merely because there was a time when they made mistakes while fulfilling the tasks assigned to them with the utmost loyalty, or did not oppose a policy that is correctly recognized today as an erroneous and deviationist one. The Party resolutely opposes all manifestations of bossism and the tendency of state and Party leaders to become detached from the masses.

IV. The Party welcomes the various initiatives put forward by workers to realize the genuine and direct participation of the working masses in the management of socialist enterprises.

The experience of the past few months, especially the rich initiative of the workers, proves that the Seventh Plenary Session's resolution on this issue, which intended to expand workers' democracy in industrial and mining enterprises by merely expanding the powers of factory committees, is insufficient and no longer meets the requirements of the most active part of the working class. It is now necessary to establish workers' autonomous trade union organs, which are organs aimed at participating in enterprise management, and which should, together with the factory director and within the existing scope of the enterprise's authority, decide on basic economic issues, such as determining production plans and assessing the progress of the implementation of production plans, expanding enterprises, improving technology, labor organization and production, quota issues and wage issues, bonuses, fund allocation, factory funds, and so on.

The basic concept guiding the cooperative management of industrial and mining enterprises by workers' autonomous organizations should be: producing more, better, and cheaper products. This is the path towards raising the living standards of the working class and the entire nation.

The regulations on autonomy must guarantee both the interests of the enterprise and the interests of the employees, as well as the interests of the entire national economy, and ensure a correct connection between central planning and the broad autonomy in enterprises.

Workers' autonomous organizations should have the right to directly participate in the appointment and removal of enterprise managers. The implementation of autonomy does not affect the principle of one person being responsible for the actual management of enterprise affairs within the guiding principles of planning and the appropriate decisions of autonomous organizations. The broad powers of autonomous organizations should not weaken the powers of managers; on the contrary, they should strengthen their powers.

Workers' autonomy should first be implemented in enterprises that are most fully prepared for this measure. The experience of these enterprises should be promoted on the basis of appropriate legal actions.

V. The Party will strive to create political and legal conditions so that the parliament, the highest organ of power in the people's democratic state, can fully perform its basic constitutional tasks under these conditions. Legislative work should be concentrated in the parliament. The parliament must fully exercise its constitutional right to comprehensively supervise the work of the government. For this purpose, it is necessary to establish a Supreme Audit Office as an organ of the parliament. When approving the state's basic documents, budgets, and annual plans for the national economy, and when approving more important international agreements, parliamentarians should have the opportunity to obtain all the information related to the issues. The parliament must have the opportunity to express its opinions on all important intentions of the government, so that only in special circumstances can issues within the parliament's jurisdiction be decided by the State Council through the promulgation of decrees, so that the parliament should be regularly and promptly informed of the government's work through the parliament's various committees.

The Central Committee approves of relieving some parliamentarians of their professional work in the future parliament, so that they can primarily and mainly engage in parliamentary activities.

It is necessary for the parliament to convene more frequently, and it is necessary for the parliament's various committees to systematically conduct work during the parliament's recess. In this case, the parliament will be an effective tool for conducting social supervision over the activities of the government and state administrative organs.

The Party will conduct its election campaign within the scope of the National Front, which is aware of its responsibility for further strengthening the people's democratic state and defending the socialist development of the country. The parliament elections will be conducted under politically exceptionally active conditions, that is to say, under conditions where the process of democratization has already attracted millions more people to actively participate in the country's social and political life.

In this election campaign, the main front of struggle will be between the following two forces: on the one hand, the socialist forces gathered under the leadership of our Party, and on the other hand, various reactionary forces, which will undoubtedly attempt to use the difficulties in the country's political situation and the economic difficulties to launch a movement against our Party, weaken the unity of the National Front, and use the resentment and distrust that have not yet been overcome among some of the working people to conduct anti-socialist agitation. In our country, freedom can only be given to the working people who are building a new socialist system. The enemies of socialism and the regime of the working people cannot be allowed to gain freedom.

The elections will be conducted according to the principle of not only enabling voters to express their opinions on the election program and decide on the election program, as has been the case until now, but also giving them the opportunity to choose among the candidates and decide who will implement this program in the parliament and how. At the same time, the Party should defeat all attempts to make the candidates oppose each other because they belong to different parties that make up the National Front.

The Seventh and Eighth Plenary Sessions of the Central Committee have made basic contributions to the National Front's program in the current parliament elections, and this program is also the guiding principle for the Party to lead the broad masses in urban and rural areas in activities within and outside the parliament, and the Party assumes responsibility for this program before the working class and the entire nation.

(II)

I. Due to the Seventh Plenary Session's resolution on accelerating the improvement of the material welfare of the working masses in urban and rural areas, the wages of basic categories of workers and staff have been further adjusted and increased, thus increasing the income of more than 4 million working people (i.e., 58.9% of the total number of all workers and staff) from the beginning of 1956. In addition, the pensions of 514,000 people have been increased. As a result, the total annual income of workers and staff will increase by more than 9.5 billion zlotys, which means that those whose wages have been increased can increase their income by an average of 177 zlotys per month in this respect.

At the same time, due to the increase in the output and supply of some agricultural products (especially meat), and also due to the state's previous increase in the purchase prices in the purchase work, the monetary income of the rural areas has greatly increased. The amount of money obtained by rural areas from selling agricultural products to the state has increased by 7.5 billion zlotys compared to 1955.

In order to improve the people's fuel supply, more than 1.2 million tons of coal have been re-allocated to improve the coal supply for urban and rural residents this year, which can be done because the amount of exported coal has been reduced. The key to improving the coal supply for residents lies in the coal mining industry fully realizing the coal mining plan and the railway fully realizing the coal transportation plan.

Due to the good results obtained in agriculture and the assistance provided by the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, the goods on the market have increased, especially certain industrial products and meat.

The above-mentioned measures taken by the Party and the government have further improved the living conditions of the working masses, but at the same time, they have also caused a danger: there is a gap between the growth of the people's purchasing power and the amount of goods on the market. Due to this situation, wage increases next year can only be implemented in principle in a small number of people in the coal mining industry and other economic sectors.

If there is no additional corresponding increase in the goods on the market, further wage increases will inevitably disrupt the balance of the market, quickly deplete the existing inventory, cause price increases, currency devaluation, and speculation, that is to say, this will be detrimental to the interests of the working people, and will also endanger the improvements that have already been obtained. Only if there is an increase in production, and if new sources of wealth are tapped to balance the people's growing purchasing power and meet the needs of the working people to a greater extent, can there be further increases in the real wages of the working class and the income of rural residents. The increase in the funds allocated to factory funds will depend on the economic results of enterprises in 1957, and this increase in funds will expand the possibility of increasing the income of employees.

The Party calls on all employees to remember that the legitimate desire to improve their own material lives depends on the actual possibilities of our national economy, and the balance and prosperity of the national economy ultimately determine the living conditions of each working people's family. In this case, the Party will resolutely oppose any instigation to pressure the government and economic organs to further increase wages beyond the country's economic possibilities.

The Party and the government have taken steps to gradually repay the fines imposed in the past few years for violating the provisions of collective contracts and violating the regulations of labor law. Reasonable and well-founded requests raised due to this situation should be met in a planned manner; the time limit is two to three years, depending on the size of the amount and the country's economic strength.

II. Although the implementation of the economic plans for industry and agriculture is generally good, some important sectors of the national economy are threatened, such as coal mining, metallurgical coke production, machinery manufacturing, building materials industry and construction industry, small-scale industry, and handicraft cooperatives. It is necessary to firmly take preventive measures to overcome these difficulties—especially in supplying the people with goods and expanding services in accordance with the growth of purchasing power, as well as in supplying industry with raw materials and implementing housing construction plans.

In order to do this, the Central Committee recommends:

	A. After thoroughly analyzing the purpose and effectiveness of the investments in the plan, further restrict the investment plan for 1957, especially to reduce industrial construction work; the building materials saved should be sold to rural residents and improve the supply of housing construction;

	B. More widely use the potential of specialized machinery manufacturing and the chemical industry to develop civilian production, especially the production of consumer goods;

	C. In order to increase the output of consumer goods, it is necessary to promote subsidiary production and abolish all restrictions in this regard (as long as the tasks of the state plan for basic production can be completed), cancel subsidiary production from the state plan, give complete freedom in the price and sales of subsidiary production, and use the profits obtained from subsidiary production as the enterprise's factory fund;

	D. Take measures without delay to increase the production of building materials beyond the current plans of the building materials industry; for this purpose, it is necessary to promote the production of bricks, iron slag concrete, and other items, as well as the production of substitutes by metallurgical factories, power plants, and other industrial and mining enterprises using waste materials; this production must be developed as subsidiary production and should first meet the needs of their own employees' personal construction and be sold to local residents; it is necessary to start up small enterprises that have stopped producing building materials within the scope of local industry, either by transferring them to handicraft cooperatives or housing construction cooperatives, farmers' associations, or renting them to private individuals. All surplus building materials beyond the needs of socialist construction should be used to increase the supply to rural and personal construction;

	E. Increase the prices of certain items that are currently sold at excessively low prices and cause waste or require subsidies from the state budget, such as wood, lime, bricks and tiles, newspapers, and rural cinema tickets;

	F. Gradually implement the principle of complete freedom of sales and pricing according to market conditions in state-owned and cooperative small-scale industries, gradually expand the scope of local industries, and transfer small and medium-sized industrial enterprises that use local raw materials to produce consumer goods to the people's congresses; in implementing the Seventh Plenary Session's resolution on the development of handicrafts, conditions should also be created for handicraftsmen to set up sales outlets to sell their own products;

	G. Make it possible to start up small private enterprises in those production sectors that can help increase the output and variety of goods without consuming the raw material resources of state-owned and cooperative industries; especially local quarrying, lime quarrying, brick and tile kiln industry, mining industry, agriculture and food processing industry, and small restaurants; in towns and districts where the socialist trade network is not perfect enough, it is necessary to facilitate the opening of private shops and stalls;

	H. Expand the system of vocational training for young people in industrial and mining enterprises, while reducing the scope of lower-level vocational training in economic sectors that do not lack manpower.

III. The situation in rural areas makes it necessary for the Party to solve some urgent problems and to fulfill the tasks that it has previously guaranteed to do more persistently. In general, the results of agricultural production are good. The harvest of cereals is higher than the average output in the past years, but slightly lower than in 1955.

On the other hand, the harvest of root crops, mainly potatoes, is much higher than last year. Therefore, the storage of feed has increased, which makes it possible to further develop animal husbandry and reduce the import of cereals to some extent. The number of pigs and cattle is increasing. However, at the same time, some adverse phenomena have appeared in urban-rural relations and the socialist transformation of agriculture.

First, in the current tense movement to purchase agricultural products, it can be seen that there is an increasingly obvious relaxation phenomenon in the implementation of the quota for selling grain, meat, and especially milk.

The Party advocates promoting the material interests of farmers in increasing agricultural production and will gradually strive to establish urban-rural relations on the basis of commodity exchange.

Due to the increase in agricultural output and the stability of the quota for selling, the proportion of contract purchases and free market purchases in the total purchase volume of agricultural products has increased since 1954. The reduction of the quota for selling will depend on the growth rate of agricultural production and the state's food reserves.

Maintaining the quota for selling system is economically necessary at present and for a considerable period of time in the future, because if we do not take this approach, we will not be able to ensure the food supply for the working class and urban residents, nor can we ensure the value of the zloty, nor can we ensure the correct distribution of national income between urban and rural people. Therefore, it is necessary to overcome all attempts to undermine the quota for selling system, and it is necessary to mobilize all rural residents to fulfill their responsibilities to the people's state. This task is of particular importance in the current economic situation of the country.

Second, in the work of socialist transformation of rural areas, the Party must concentrate its attention in the recent period on strengthening those agricultural cooperatives that have the conditions for healthy development. In particular, they should be given assistance so that they can continuously increase collective output and supply the state with a portion, and on this basis ensure an increase in the income of agricultural cooperative members. Assistance should be given in terms of capital expenditure, mechanization of the production process, guidance of agricultural science, priority in contract purchases, and supply of artificial fertilizers.

The internal affairs of agricultural cooperatives must be free from interference by state and Party organs. Cooperatives must have complete autonomy in production organization, work remuneration, property disposal, income distribution, housing construction, relations with other enterprises, and so on. Cooperatives must have the opportunity to purchase agricultural machinery and tools, tractors, and automobiles with their own financial resources and according to credit terms.

While continuing to work hard to consolidate cooperatives, it is also necessary to allow the dissolution of cooperatives that do not have the conditions for further development and discredit cooperative farming. All attempts to encourage them to exist by providing them with gratuitous economic assistance from the state should be considered harmful. The National Committee of Agricultural Cooperatives, the People's Congress, and Party organizations should take the initiative on this issue.

While implementing the policy of further developing the production of individual farmers, the Party also emphasizes its repeated position that cooperative farming in rural areas is necessary because it eliminates all forms of human exploitation, gives laboring farmers a deep sense of collective social production, reduces the heavy and arduous work of farmers by using machines, and taps the possibility of obtaining large yields from every hectare of land. If this is the case, farmers, workers, and the entire nation can live better. Farmer production collectives are an arduous programmatic task, and the complete victory of socialism in our country is impossible without fulfilling this task.

Third, experience shows that the current method of providing machinery services to agriculture, especially to agricultural cooperatives, has not achieved the expected results, and this method is wasteful and inefficient. The investment expenditure and management costs of state machinery stations and rural machinery stations are disproportionate to the economic results achieved.

Therefore, it should be:
	A. Gradually abolish rural machinery stations as the state's center, and sell the machinery and equipment of rural machinery stations to farmer groups and machinery cooperative groups, or to agricultural cooperatives, and for this purpose allow them to purchase on credit when necessary. Before farmer groups and machinery cooperative groups are formed, it is necessary to reduce subsidies to rural machinery stations and stipulate the service costs of rural machinery stations according to cost accounting.

	B. Retain and strengthen state machinery stations located in areas where agricultural cooperatives are very dense and have indispensable material and technical bases. These centers should be profitable because the agricultural cooperatives they serve have sufficient cultivated land area and they have sufficient machinery. Their services to agricultural cooperatives should only be paid in cash, not in kind. In areas where there are few agricultural cooperatives, material and technical conditions, and their distance from agricultural cooperatives make the work of state machinery stations unprofitable and very expensive, state machinery stations should be reorganized as repair stations for the machinery of agricultural cooperatives and farmers, and as places to rent combine harvesters and other heavy machinery.

Fourth, in order to provide favorable conditions for the further struggle to increase agricultural output, it is now necessary to do everything possible to ensure that the Seventh Plenary Session's resolution is implemented, which is about eliminating deviations in the policy towards the wealthier part of the middle peasants and towards the rich peasant households, the result of which is often not limiting exploitation, but limiting the agricultural production of those households.

Fifth, in order to strengthen farmers' awareness of ownership, it is necessary to abolish the restrictions on the sale of land and on the right to inherit land, including the land distributed to farmers in the land reform, and the land distributed to farmers under the immigration plan in the western regions.

(III)

The struggle for democratization, for socialist construction, and for consolidating the Party's leading role is closely linked to People's Poland's participation in the socialist state camp, and in the international movement of socialist and progressive forces that are struggling to ease international tensions and for peaceful coexistence. Our Party inextricably links the interests of People's Poland with the unshakable principles of the Polish-Soviet alliance and with the interests of the entire socialist camp.

The resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU had a significant impact on the transformation of the international working-class movement, and on the movement of reason that they encouraged and that is flourishing in the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries; these resolutions enable us today to better understand and eliminate the root causes of the errors and deviations that existed during the past period not only in the various countries of our camp but also in the relations between the Communist Parties of various countries.

Due to these transformations, the conditions for establishing relations between the various parties in our camp based on principles that fully conform to the Leninist spirit have emerged.

In realizing the tasks of socialist construction, the Party utilizes the experience of the Soviet Union, the first socialist country, and other countries that are striving to achieve the same goals as us. But it believes that it is incorrect to mechanically copy and apply the models and methods adopted by other countries. The Party will seek methods and solutions that arise from our country's specific conditions and our historical development, based on the interests of the Polish working class and the Polish people. The Party expresses that it believes that the modes of socialist development can be different in different countries and under different historical conditions, and believes that this rich diversity of socialist development is conducive to its consolidation on an international scale.

The links between socialist countries arise from common aspirations and common goals—building socialism and communism.

In choosing the most appropriate road, the road that is most adapted to the historical conditions of each country, and in choosing the methods of building a new and superior system, this link not only does not exclude, but on the contrary, respects the full sovereignty and independence of each country and nation.

Relations between parties and between countries must be formed on the principle of the international unity of the working class; the basis of this relationship must be mutual trust and equal rights, mutual assistance, mutual goodwill criticism (if necessary), and wise resolution of all disputes in the spirit of friendship and socialism. Within the scope of this relationship, each country should have complete independence and sovereignty, and the rights of each nation to a sovereign government in an independent country must be fully and mutually respected.

The Party resolutely struggles against all attempts by reactionaries to undermine the unity of the countries of the socialist camp both domestically and internationally, and to weaken the Polish-Soviet alliance. At present, the Party must oppose any manifestation of anti-Soviet propaganda, and the Party must resolutely fight against all attempts to incite nationalistic sentiments and anti-Soviet sentiments.

Polish-Soviet relations based on the principles of equality and independence will generate a deep sense of friendship towards the Soviet Union among the Polish people, so that all attempts to create distrust of the Soviet Union will not be responded to in our country.

The unity and close cooperation of socialist countries is the most lasting foundation of our country's policy and the most lasting foundation for consolidating independence and peacefully developing socialism; at the same time, this unity and cooperation also serve the interests of the universal struggle of the people of all countries for peace, progress, and socialism.

    波兰统一工人党第八次中央全会
    关于党在目前的政治和经济任务的决议
    新华社华沙27日电　波兰统一工人党中央委员会第八次全体会议关于党在目前的政治和经济任务的决议。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会同意哥穆尔卡—维斯瓦夫同志的发言中所提出的政治路线，通过决议如下：
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会第八次全体会议关于党在目前的政治和经济任务的决议。
                        （一）
    一、中央委员会宣布：波兰在社会主义道路上的进一步发展方面的决定性任务，目前在于巩固我们的党作为工人阶级、波兰人民和人民的国家在政治和思想方面的指导力量的领导作用。
    只有当党果敢地、毫不犹豫地实践中央委员会第七次全体会议所提出的正确路线——有计划地改善城乡劳动人民的生活条件的路线，实行深刻的社会主义的民主化的路线的时候，党才能够实现它的领导作用。
    使第七次全体会议所通过的正确的决议不能贯彻的主要障碍在于，中央委员会政治局在解决党内和国内生活的社会主义民主化过程中的具体问题的时候，缺乏一致性和一贯性。在这种情况下，中央委员会的活动往往陷于瘫痪，这样就削弱了党对于群众的迅速提高的政治积极性的领导作用。
    党必须领导工人阶级和全国人民中间的一切先进的社会主义的力量努力克服过去一个时期的残余、错误和偏差，以期排除不可避免的暂时的困难和障碍，战胜反动势力的阴谋，并且把这种努力贯彻到底。
    党必须不断克服它队伍里的保守主义和畏缩不前的作风，它必须克服惧怕新事物的心理和死抱着过时的理论和老一套的办法的情况，以及想开倒车和恢复陈旧的管理和施政方法——具有斯大林主义的偏差和本国的偏差的特色的方法——的尝试。
    只有这样，我们才能够克服混乱和被动，我们才能够动员和紧密党的队伍。只有这样，我们才能够对那些有时犯错误然而却是献身于社会主义事业的人的努力给予正确的指导。
    只有这样，我们才能够克服在动摇分子中间、特别是在某些知识分子中间的错误的资产阶级自由主义的倾向。
    只有这样，我们才能够孤立反动势力——正在加紧活动、企图使阶级斗争激烈化并且力图利用我国政治生活的民主化来反对社会主义、从而反对民主、并且挑拨波兰和苏联的关系的反动势力，使它们无法为害。
    在同保守势力、同开倒车和阻止发扬党内民主以及压制批评的企图、同破坏法制和重新为官僚主义辩护、重新实行小暴君的方法以及干言行不一致的勾当的企图所进行的斗争中，党将集合和领导一切健康的社会主义的力量。
    党必须领导目的在于改善经济方法和增加工人阶级直接参加管理社会主义企业和治理国家的机会的先进工人运动，领导农民发展自治，加强民主制度和人民会议的权力，提高农业产量，领导知识分子中的空前活跃的社会主义知识分子运动。
    党将帮助波兰青年联盟和波兰青年实现他们希望在最大程度上参加国家政治生活的热烈愿望，帮助他们进行思想上和组织上的工作，使得青年中的先进部分能够同党建立更加密切的联系，增加党对整个青年一代的影响。
    在实现社会主义民主化的斗争中，党将加强它同友党即统一农民党和民主党的合作关系，以巩固全国阵线的政治核心。
    二、党不能容许口头上和形式上服从党的决议的做法，也不能容忍在负责岗位上有拒绝积极和坚决地执行这些决议的同志。
    党必须保证党内民主所必不可少的条件——党的生活必须公开，这个条件以前一直没有严格地保持；尤其是，党必须保证经常把党的领导机构对党的政策中当前的问题的态度告诉党员们，保证必须答复党员所提出的问题和要求，并且保证党的机构必须系统地向选举它们的党员群众提出报告。
    党将特别注意在党的一切组织——从最基层的组织到最高的组织——当中确保根据党章来自由选举党的机构的条件，保证能够毫无阻碍地进行党的机构的候选人提名工作，保证能够自由讨论各种提名，并且保证选举的秘密性——这不仅包括党的委员会，而且也包括执行机构和书记，其中也包括中央委员会政治局和中央委员会书记处。
    为了正确地选择党机构的工作人员，为了增加他们对党组织的责任，必须采纳这样一个原则：党机构的负责工作人员应该在党组织的全体会议上选出。根据第七次全体会议的决议，党应该加紧简化机构、改变党机构的工作作风、保证党干部的分配和使用足以加强工厂和机关，特别是大工厂中的基层党组织的活动。
    党的队伍的团结和一致是党的力量的基石，是它进行有效的工作的一个条件。在党员就党的政策问题进行自由讨论和交换意见的同时，必须从一个决定作出之时起就严格地和无条件地遵守纪律来执行党的任务。党决不容忍有任何削弱党纪的行为或者逃避执行党所作出的决定和规定的任务的行为。
    党的行动一致只有在共产党员的思想一致的基础上和创造性的马克思列宁主义的原则的基础上才可能实现。我们必须果敢地在思想和实践上纠正过去的错误和偏差，根据列宁主义的立场，根据党的纲领性原则的立场对不符合党的路线的观点进行原则性的批评，从而加强党的行动一致。
    党的思想一致和党的队伍的团结并不意味着党员对党组织的决定不能存在分歧意见。党坚持列宁主义的观点：在党纲的范围内，党员对党的日常活动的各种问题抱分歧意见是可以容许的，是不可避免的。抱有不同见解的党员可以坚持他们的见解，可以向他们所属的组织或者上级党组织提出他们的见解，但是他们不能在违反党的观点的情况下诉诸党外的舆论。在他们的实际活动中，他们必须无条件执行党的决定。
    党认为，党组织不能用纪律手段来迫使党员放弃他们不同的意见。但是，在党内，抱有违反党的纲领原则的意见的人或者其实际活动有害于这些原则的人是没有地位的。
    党谴责按照民族血统在党的队伍中划分人为界线的观点和方法，谴责由于某一部分的人口的血统而对他们表示歧视的作法，这种作法助长了反犹太主义和同党的思想不相容的和败坏党干部的道德的一切民族主义倾向。在党的人事政策中，我们应该根据这些原则来考虑：同志们的政治条件和职业条件，他们的观点，思想成熟和道德品质，他们和群众的联系，他们在为工人阶级事业和劳动人民事业进行的斗争中的忘我精神。
    党反对使工人阶级和知识分子不和的一切企图——轻视工人阶级的领导作用和轻视知识分子在建立一个新的制度和在发展国家的经济、文化事业中的作用的重要性。在一部分知识分子中表现出来的动摇不能成为不信任知识分子中进步的知识分子运动的借口。这个运动和工人阶级的团结比过去任何时候都更加坚强了。
    现阶段的特点是：在工人运动中列宁主义原则的恢复，革命思想的伟大觉醒和反对在理论上和实践上的异己的赘疣和歪曲的斗争。在这个阶段中，必需把党的力量集中在思想战线上，以决定党对于目前思想上的问题的态度，领导国内的知识分子运动以及对付混乱和敌对思想的表现。
    三、党认为，党和国家的领导人应当负责执行所交付给他们的任务和职责这个原则，必须当作社会主义民主主义的基本原则之一而予以完全恢复。虽然过去在形式上承认了这个原则，但是在实践中却违反了它。在他们的活动中由于愚蠢或者犯严重的错误而丧失威信的人，以及不能改正自己错误的人，一定不能继续留在负责的岗位上。
    为了有力地重新明确这一观点，党反对在公众眼目中降低那些献身于社会主义事业而且占我们国家的和党的机构的绝大部分的忠诚的领导人的威信——仅仅是因为曾经有个时候，当他们以最大的忠诚去完成交给他们的任务的时候他们犯了错误，或者没有反对今天正确地认识到是一种错误的、具有偏差的政策。党坚决反对首长心理的各种表现，并且反对国家和党的领导人脱离群众的倾向。
    四、党欢迎工人们为了实现工人群众能真正地和直接地参加社会主义企业的管理而提出的各种各样的倡议。
    过去几个月的经验、特别是工人们丰富的首创性证明：第七次全体会议就这个问题所作的、打算用仅仅扩大工厂委员会的权力的办法来扩大工矿企业中的工人的民主的决议是不够的，而且不再适应工人阶级最积极的部分的要求了。现在有必要建立工人自治的职工机关，这是一个旨在参加企业管理的机关，它应当同厂长一道，在企业现有的权限范围以内，决定基本的经济问题，例如，确定生产计划和鉴定执行生产计划的进展，扩大企业，改进技术，劳动组织和生产，定额问题和工资问题，奖金，基金分配，工厂基金等等。
    指导工人自治机构合作管理工矿企业的基本观念应当是：生产更多、更好、更便宜的产品。这是通向提高工人阶级和全国人民的生活水平的道路。
    关于自治的法规必须既能够保证企业的利益和职工的利益，又能够保证整个国民经济的利益以及使中央计划和企业中的广泛的自治之间有正确的联系。
    工人自治机构应该有权直接参加任命和撤销企业经理人员。实行自治并不影响在计划的指导原则和自治机构的适当的决定范围内一人负责实际管理企业事务的原则。自治机构的广大权力不应当削弱经理人员的权力，相反，应当加强他们权力。
    工人自治应当首先在对于这项措施具有最充分准备的企业中实行。这些企业的经验应当在适当的法律行动的基础上推广。
    五、党将努力创造政治和法律条件，使议会这一个人民民主国家的最高权力机关在这些条件下完全能够执行它的基本的宪法任务。立法工作应该集中在议会。议会必须充分运用它对政府工作进行全面监督的宪法权利。为了这个目的，有必要设立一个最高监察院作为议会的一个机构。在批准国家的基本文件、预算和国民经济年度计划的时候，在批准比较重要的国际协定的时候，议员应当有机会得到所有有关问题的全部情况。议会必须有机会对政府的所有重要意图表示它的意见，这样，只有在特殊情况下，属于议会职权范围内的问题才由国务委员会通过颁布法令的方式来决定，这样，议会应当通过议会各委员会经常地、及时地获知政府的工作情况。
    中央委员会赞成解除将来议会中部分议员的职业工作，以便使他们能够首先和主要从事于议会的活动。
    议会有必要更加经常地召开会议，在议会休会期间，议会各委员会有必要系统地进行工作。在这种情况下，议会将是对政府和国家行政机关的活动进行社会监督的一个有效的工具。
    党将在全国阵线范围内进行它的选举运动，全国阵线是意识到它对进一步加强人民民主国家和保卫国家的社会主义发展所负的责任的。议会的选举将在政治上异常活跃的条件下进行，也就是说，将在民主化的进程已经吸引了成百万更多的人民积极参与国家的社会和政治生活的情况下进行。
    在这个选举运动中，斗争的主要战线将在以下两种势力之间：一方面是在我们党的领导下集合起来的社会主义力量，另一方面是各种反动势力，这些势力无疑地将企图利用国家的政治局势中的困难以及经济上的困难来开展一个反对我们党的运动，削弱全国阵线的团结和利用在一部分劳动人民中间尚未克服的愤懑和不信任的情绪进行反社会主义的煽动。在我国，自由只能给予建设社会主义新制度的劳动人民。不能让社会主义和劳动人民政权的敌人获得自由。
    选举将根据这样的原则来进行：不仅使选民能够对选举纲领表示他们的意见和决定选举纲领，像至今存在的那种情形，而且还要给予他们机会，使他们能够在候选人当中进行选择，并且决定将由什么人和怎么样在议会中实现这个纲领。同时，党应当击败一切使候选人由于属于组成全国阵线的不同党派而互相反对的一切尝试。
    中央委员会的第七次和第八次全体会议已经对全国阵线在当前议会选举中的纲领作出了基本的贡献，这个纲领同时也是党在议会以内和以外领导广大城乡群众进行活动的指导方针，党在工人阶级和全国人民面前对这个纲领负起了责任。
                        （二）
    一、由于第七次全体会议的关于加速改善城乡劳动群众的物质福利的决议，已经进一步调整和增加了基本类别的工人和职员的工资，这样就从1956年初起使四百多万劳动人民（也就是所有的工人和职员总数的58.9％）的收入增加了。此外，有五十一万四千人的养老金增加了。结果，工人和职员的全年总收入将增加九十五亿兹罗提以上，这就是说，凡是工资获得增加的人从这方面每月可以平均增加收入一百七十七兹罗提。
    同时，由于一些农产品的产量和供应量增加（特别是肉类），还由于国家以前在收购工作中提高了收购价格，农村的货币收入大大增加了。农村向国家出售农产品所得的钱的数目比1955年增加了七十五亿兹罗提。
    为了改善人民的燃料供应，已经再拨出一百二十余万吨煤来改善本年对城市和农村居民的用煤供应，能做到这一点，是由于减少了出口煤的数量。改善对居民的用煤供应的关键在于采煤工业充分实现采煤计划以及充分实现铁路的运煤计划。
    由于农业方面获得了良好结果和苏联及捷克斯洛伐克所给予的帮助，市场上的货物已经有了增加，特别是某些工业产品和肉类。
    党和政府所采取的上述措施使得劳动群众的生活情况有了进一步的改善，但在同时也引起了这样一种危险：人民购买力的增长同市场上的货物的数量存在了距离。由于这个情况，明年的工资增加在原则上只能在采煤工业和其他经济部门中很少的一部分人中实行。
    如果市场上的货物没有额外的相应增加，工资的进一步增加将不可避免地会扰乱市场的平衡，很快地耗尽现有的存货，引起物价上涨、货币贬值和投机，那就是说，这是会不利于劳动人民的利益，并且也会危害目前所已经获得的改善。只有在生产有了增加的情况下，在挖掘新的财源足以平衡人民日益增长的购买力和在更大的程度上满足劳动人民的需要的情况下，工人阶级的实际工资和农村居民的收入才能够有进一步的增加。拨给工厂基金的款项的增加将视1957年企业的经济结果而定，这种基金的增加将扩大提高职工的收入的可能性。
    党向全体职工呼吁，要求他们记住：改善他们自己的物质生活的正当愿望决定于我们国民经济的实际可能性，而国民经济的平衡和繁荣又最后决定每个劳动人民家庭的生活情况。在这种情况下，党将坚决反对那种要求向政府和经济机构施加压力以便超过国家的经济可能性而进一步增加工资的任何煽动。
    党和政府已经采取步骤来逐步偿付由于在过去几年违反集体合同的规定以及违反劳工法条例而罚的款项。由于这种情况而提出来的有道理和有根据的要求应该有计划地予以满足；其时限为两年到三年，这要看数目之大小和国家的经济力量而定。
    二、虽然工业和农业的经济计划的实施情况总的说来是良好的，可是国民经济的某些重要部门却遭到威胁，例如采煤，冶金用的焦煤的生产，机器制造业，建筑材料工业和建筑业，小规模工业和手工业合作社。有必要坚定地采取预防措施以便克服这些困难——尤其是在随着购买力的增长相应地供给人民货物和扩大服务方面以及在供给工业以原料和执行房屋建筑计划方面。
    为了做到这点，中央委员会建议：
    甲、在对计划中的投资的目的性和有效性作一个透彻的分析以后，对1957年的投资计划实行进一步的限制，尤其是要减少工业的建筑工作；省下来的建筑材料应该卖给农村居民和改进对住房建筑的供应；
    乙、更广泛地利用专门的机器制造业和化学工业的潜力来发展民用生产，尤其是消费品的生产；
    丙、为了增加消费品的产量，有必要促进副属生产和废除这方面的一切限制（只要关于基本生产的国家计划的任务能够完成），把副属生产从国家计划中取消，在副属生产的价格和销售方面给予完全的自由，并把从副属生产中所获得的利润用作企业的工厂基金；
    丁、毫不延迟地采取目的在于使建筑材料生产的增加超出建筑材料工业目前的计划的措施；为此，必须促进砖块、铁渣混凝土等物品的生产以及冶金工厂、发电站和其他工矿企业利用废弃材料制造代用材料的生产；这种生产必须作为副属生产来发展，而且应当首先满足它们自己的职工个人建筑的需要以及出售给当地居民；必须使停顿的生产建筑材料的小企业在地方工业范围内开工，办法是，或者把它们转入手工业合作社或者房屋建筑合作社、农民协会，或是出租给私人。超出社会化建筑需要的所有剩余的建筑材料应当用来增加对农村和个人建筑的供应；
    戊、提高到目前为止售价过低并且造成浪费或者需要国家预算津贴的某些物品的价格，如木板、石灰、砖瓦、报纸、乡村电影院票；
    己、在国营和合作社的小规模工业中逐步实行完全的销售自由和根据市场情况定价的原则，逐步扩大地方工业范围，把利用当地原料生产消费品的中小工业企业移交给人民会议；在实现第七次全体会议关于发展手工业的决议时，还应当创造条件，使手工业者能够设立售货站，以销售他们自己的产品；
    庚、使那些能够有助于增加货物的产量和品种而不致消耗国营和合作社工业的原料资源的生产部门中的小型私人企业有可能发动起来；特别是地方的采石业、采石灰业、砖瓦窑业、开矿业、农业和食品加工业以及小型餐馆等；在社会主义的贸易网还不够完善的镇、区内，有必要使开设私营商店和货摊得到便利；
    辛、扩大在工矿企业中对青年进行职业训练的制度，同时缩小在并不缺乏人力的经济部门中的较低级的职业训练的范围。
    三、农村的情况使党有必要解决一些急迫的问题以及更加坚持不渝地履行以前保证要做的任务。一般说来，农业生产的结果是良好的。谷物的收获量高于过去年代的平均产量，但是略低于1955年。
    另一方面，根菜作物、主要是马铃薯的收获量比去年提高很多。因此，饲料的储藏有了增加，这就使得有可能进一步发展畜牧业和在某种程度上减少谷物的进口。猪和牛的头数正在增加。但是，同时，在城乡关系和农业的社会主义改造方面，却出现了一些不良的现象。
    第一，在目前的紧张的收购农产品的运动中，可以看出，在执行谷物、肉类、特别是牛奶的缴售定额方面，有日益明显的放松现象。
    党主张促进农民在提高农业生产中的物质利益，并且将逐步努力把城乡关系建立在商品交换的基础上。
    由于农产量提高和缴售定额数量的稳定，从1954年开始，合同购买量和自由市场购买量在农产品的总购买量中所占的比重增加了。缴售定额的减少要取决于农业生产和国家的粮食储备量的增长率。
    保持缴售定额制度在目前和今后一个相当长的时间内是经济上所必须的，因为如果不采取这种做法，我们就既不能保证工人阶级和城市居民的粮食供应，又不能保证兹罗提的价值，也不能保证国民收入在城乡人民之间的正确分配。因此有必要克服一切破坏缴售定额制度的企图，有必要动员全体乡村居民履行对人民国家的职责。这个任务在目前国家的经济状况中有着特殊重要的意义。
    第二，在农村社会主义改造的工作中，党在最近时期内要把注意力集中在加强那些有条件健康发展的农业合作社上。特别是，应当给予它们帮助，使它们能够不断增加集体的产量和供应国家的部分，并且在这个基础上保证农业合作社社员的收入增加。应当在资金支出、生产过程的机械化、农业科学的指导、合同购买的优先权和供应人造肥料等方面给予这种帮助。
    农业合作社的内部事务必须不受国家和党的机构的干涉。合作社在生产组织、工作报酬、财产处理、收入分配、修建房屋、同其他企业之间的关系等等方面必须有完全的自决权。合作社必须有机会以自己的财力和根据信用条件来购买农业机器和工具、拖拉机和汽车。
    在继续努力巩固合作社的同时，还必须容许解散不具备进一步发展条件和使得合作化耕作失去信誉的合作社。一切以国家给予无偿的经济援助的办法鼓励它们存在下去的企图，都应该被认为是有害的。应该由农业合作社全国委员会、人民会议和党组织在这个问题上采取主动。
    党在执行进一步发展个体农户生产政策的同时，还强调它一再表示的立场，就是农村中的合作化耕作是必需的，因为它肃清人剥削人的一切形式，使劳动农民具有一种深刻的社会生产集体的感觉，由于使用机器而减轻农民们繁重而劳累的工作，挖掘从每一公顷土地上得到大量收成的可能性。如果是这样，农民、工人以及全国人民就可以生活得更好一些。农民生产集体是一项艰巨的纲领性任务，不履行这项任务，我国社会主义的完全胜利就不可能。
    第三，经验表明，目前为农业、尤其是为农业合作社提供机器服务的方式，并没有获得预期的效果，这种方式是浪费和缺乏效率的。投资开支和管理国家机器站和农村机器站的费用同所取得的经济效果是不成比例的。
    因此，应当：
      （甲）逐渐取消作为国家的中心的农村机器站，并且把农村机器站的机器和装备卖给农民小组和机器合作组，或者卖给农业合作社，并且为了这个目的在必要时允许它们赊购。在农民小组和机器合作组组成以前，有必要减少给予农村机器站的津贴，并且规定农村机器站的服务代价，按照成本计算。
      （乙）保留和加强座落在农业合作社很稠密、并且有不可缺少的物质和技术基地的地区的国家机器站。这些中心应该是可以赢利的，因为它们所服务的农业合作社有足够的耕地面积，而且它们拥有足够的机器。它们为农业合作社的服务只应该以现款、而不应该以实物支付。在农业合作社很少、物质和技术条件以及它们同农业合作社的遥远距离使得国家机器站的工作不能赢利，而且费用很高的地区，国家机器站应该改组，作为农业合作社和农民的机器的修理站，作为出租联合机和其他重型机器的地方。
    第四，为了为提高农业产量的进一步斗争提供有利条件，目前必须尽全力保证第七次全体会议的决议得到实施，这个决议是关于消除对中农中较富裕部分以及对富农农户的政策的偏差，这种偏差的结果常常不是限制了剥削，而是限制了那些农户的农业生产。
    第五，为了加强农民的所有权的意识，必须取消对于出售土地、对于承继土地的权利的限制，包括在土地改革中分给农民的土地，以及根据在西部地区的移民计划分给农民的土地。
                        （三）
    为民主化、为社会主义建设和为巩固党的领导作用而进行的斗争，同人民波兰参加社会主义国家阵营、参加为缓和国际紧张局势和和平共处而斗争的社会主义和进步力量的国际运动，有着极密切的联系。我们的党把人民波兰的利益同波苏联盟的不可动摇的原则、同整个社会主义阵营的利益牢不可分地结合在一起。
    苏共第二十次代表大会的决议对国际工人阶级运动中的转变，对它们所鼓励的而且正在各国共产党和工人党中蓬勃发展的发扬理智运动产生了重大的影响；这些决议使我们今天能够更好地了解和消除过去这段时期不仅在我们阵营的各国内而且也在各国共产党之间的关系中存在的错误和偏差的根源。
    由于这些转变，我们阵营内的各个党之间根据完全符合列宁主义精神的原则建立关系的条件已经产生了。
    在实现社会主义建设任务方面，党利用了第一个社会主义国家苏联和正在努力实现同我们一样的目的的其他各国的经验。但是它认为机械地抄袭和搬用其他国家采用的型式和方式的方法是不正确的。党将根据波兰工人阶级和波兰人民的利益，寻求从我国的具体情况和我们的历史发展产生的方法和解决办法。党表示，它认为在不同国家和不同历史条件下，社会主义发展的方式是可以不同的，并且认为，这种社会主义发展方式的丰富多样有利于它在国际范围内的巩固。
    社会主义国家间的联系是产生于共同的愿望和共同的目的——建设社会主义和共产主义。
    在选择最恰当的道路、最能适应于各国历史条件的道路以及选择建设一个新的、优越的制度的方法方面，这种联系不仅不排斥，而且恰恰相反，是尊重每一个国家和民族的充分的主权和独立的。
    各党之间和各国之间的关系必须在国际工人阶级团结一致的原则上形成起来；这种关系的基础必须是相互信任和权利平等、相互援助、相互善意批评（如果有此必要的话）以及本着友谊和社会主义的精神明智地解决一切争执。在这种关系的范围内，每一个国家应该有完全的独立和主权，每一个民族的在一个独立国家中拥有主权的政府的权利必须受到充分的和相互的尊重。
    党坚决地进行斗争，反对反动分子企图在这个国家和在国际范围内破坏社会主义阵营各国的团结、削弱波苏联盟的一切尝试。在目前，党必须反对反苏宣传的任何表现，党必须对要想激起民族主义情绪和反苏情绪的一切企图进行坚决的斗争。
    以平等和独立的原则为基础的波苏关系将在波兰人民中间产生对苏联的一种深厚的友好感情，以致想对苏联制造不信任的一切企图在我国得不到响应。
    社会主义国家的团结一致和紧密合作是我国政策的最持久的基础，是巩固独立与和平发展社会主义的最持久的基础；同时，这种团结和合作也服务于各国人民争取和平、进步和社会主义的普遍斗争的利益。
