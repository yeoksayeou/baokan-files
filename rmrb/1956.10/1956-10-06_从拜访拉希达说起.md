Starting from a Visit to Rashida
Zi Gang

I happened to have business with Comrade Burhan. After we finished talking, I had a separate chat with his wife, Rashida. We had met once in Urumqi five years ago.

She is a Tatar, and Comrade Burhan is a Uyghur. Her Chinese is not as good as her husband's. She is currently working hard to learn and preparing to enter the Socialist Academy for systematic study, so she can work in Beijing. She graduated from the Tashkent Normal School in the Soviet Union, taught at a middle school in Urumqi, and later worked in the Women's Federation.

"Now, I don't have any specific work," she said sadly. "This problem can be solved after studying. But there is another bad phenomenon—" She frowned and continued in broken Chinese.

"Mainly, after coming to Beijing, I have no social interaction except for taking care of my four children's homework. At meetings, the Han comrades, both men and women, are very good friends to me; but after the meetings, there is no contact at all.

"When I participated in the Chinese women's delegation led by Comrade Li Dequan to visit Pakistan last year, they treated me very warmly. I invited them to visit my home in Beijing later, and especially told one or two of my female friends who went with me. However, the Han sisters don't seem to be used to this.

"I think life should be richer. Women can talk about problems in their work, books they have read, housework, and the education of their children..." Rashida's sincere voice from the bottom of her heart struck my nerves. Her criticism hit the nail on the head, "It seems that Han comrades only have their spouses and children on holidays. Thinking back to my life in Urumqi, it was so interesting. There was a lot of contact between women of different ethnic groups in Xinjiang, sometimes singing and dancing, sometimes chatting, sometimes visiting each other. On ethnic festivals, everyone brought their children dressed in new clothes to pay festive visits, eat food, and the children's lives were also diverse. Soviet schools have always required parents to pay attention to what kind of people their children know, because this has a great impact on their growth. But now, my children don't have any friends who move between families. Occasionally, a parent's old friend comes, and they are extremely happy, participating in conversations and answering various questions. A Han friend observed this and keenly felt that this phenomenon was very good, but in fact, this is a normal phenomenon that is not surprising."

Why can't we visit each other? Why can't we have a simple meal or drink some tea together? Why can't we let the children get to know some uncles, aunts, and their children? These children are friends of the same age outside of classmates. Rashida pointed out the shortcomings in our lives, and this is not nitpicking.

Everyone feels that there is no "private friendship" after liberation, and old friends have stopped communicating, as if everyone is doing revolutionary work, and it is best not to disturb each other. Being busy is a fact, but it is also an excuse.

Since life has been simplified, then the ideology and even the literature and art reflecting life will inevitably be...

It should be noted that the lack of social interaction is only part of the shortcomings in our lives, not the whole.

Here, I would like to take the opportunity to raise a long-standing opinion: the issue of working hours. Some Soviet agencies implement a continuous eight-hour work system, with a half-hour lunch break in the middle. Some factories also work longer in the early shift and get off work very early in the afternoon. In this way, there is ample time for self-study, social interaction, and cultural entertainment, without having to squeeze everything into Sunday. Under the current working conditions, eight hours of work with about two hours of lunch break, is actually not very useful; the round trip for people who live far away adds up to a lot of time—for example, leaving home at 7:00 and arriving home at 7:00, not counting evening meetings. Being extremely tired on weekdays, people want to rest even more on Sundays, or even busier—having to shop, watch a movie, take care of children returning from daycare and school, and fill in for the nanny's day off.

I think some jobs can very well consider continuous working hours. If we get off work at 4:00 in the afternoon, we can study independently, visit parks, shop, watch movies, supervise our children's homework, and also have some social interaction, without having to "squeeze" into Sunday!

Oh my God, that would be too beautiful!

    从拜访拉希达说起
    子冈
    偶然有事去找鲍尔汉同志，谈完后，又单独和他夫人拉希达闲谈，我们五年前曾在乌鲁木齐有一面之缘。
    她是塔塔尔族，鲍尔汉同志是维吾尔族。她的汉文汉话不如她丈夫，目前正在努力学习，并准备进社会主义学院系统地学习，好在北京参加工作。她是在苏联塔什干师范学校毕业的，在乌鲁木齐中学教过书，后来从事妇联工作。
      “现在，我却没有具体工作，”她忧郁地说，“这个问题等学习以后可以解决。可是，还有一个不好的现象——”她眉尖深锁地、用不熟练的汉话谈下去。
      “主要的是，我到了北京来，除了照顾四个孩子的家庭作业之外，什么社会交往也没有了。在开会的时候，汉族男女同志是我很好的朋友；但是开会以后，从不来往。
      “当我去年参加以李德全同志为首的中国妇女代表团到巴基斯坦去访问的时候，她们待我很亲热，我曾约她们回北京后来我家作客，特别叮嘱过一、二位同去的女友。可是，汉族姐妹好像不习惯这些。
    “我想，人的生活是应该丰富一些的，妇女们在一起也可以谈谈工作里的问题、谈谈读过的书、家务、儿女的教育……”拉希达娓娓地从心底发出的呼声敲动了我的脑神经，她批评得正中要害，“好像汉族同志在放假的日子里只有爱人和儿女。回想我在乌鲁木齐的生活多有意思啊，新疆各族妇女的接触很多，有时歌舞，有时谈天，有时互相拜访。碰到民族节日，大家携儿带女穿了新衣裳来回拜节，吃东西，孩子们的生活也是多种多样的。苏联学校里一向要家长注意孩子们的知交是什么样人，因为这对孩子的成长有很大关系。可是现在呢，我的孩子们就没有什么在家庭间走动的知交。偶然父、母亲来个老朋友，他们欢喜极了，参加谈话，回答各种问题；有个汉族朋友观察到这点，敏锐地觉得这现象很好，其实这是不足为奇的正常现象。”
    为什么不能互相拜访走动呢？为什么不能在一起吃顿便饭、喝点茶呢？为什么不能让孩子们认识些伯伯叔叔阿姨姑姑和他们的孩子呢？这些孩子正是同学以外的同年代朋友啊。拉希达指出了我们生活中的缺陷，这一点也不是吹毛求疵。
    大家觉得解放以后没有什么“私交”了，老朋友断了往来，好像彼此在干革命工作，互不打扰为妙。忙是事实，也是借口。
    生活既已简单化，那么，思想意识以致于反映生活的文学艺术也就难免………
    应该说明，社交的缺乏只是我们生活缺陷的一部，而非全部。
    这里，我倒想顺便提一个久已想提的意见：关于上班时间问题。苏联有些机关是实行连贯八小时上班制的，中间有半小时午餐，有些工厂也是早班多做些时候，下午很早下班。这样，才有充分的自修、社交和文化娱乐时间，而不必事事挤到星期日。在目前的上班情况下，八小时工作，中午约有二小时午休，其实用处不大；远道上班的人往返加在一起是一个对时——例如七时离家，七时到家，还不算晚上开会。平日既疲倦已极，星期日就更想休息，或竟更忙——要采买、要看场电影、要招待从托儿所和学校回来的孩子、要给保姆的公休作替工。
    我觉得有些工作大可以考虑连贯上班。假若午后四时下班，我们可以独立进修、可以游园、可以采买、可以看电影、可以给孩子督课、也可以有些社交往还，不必“挤”星期日了！
    天哪，那太美了！
