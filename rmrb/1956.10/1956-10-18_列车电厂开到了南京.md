    Train Power Plant Arrives in Nanjing

    (Our report) A power plant installed on a train arrived in Nanjing on October 7th from Luoyang to support the industrial electricity needs of Nanjing, Wuxi, and Changzhou.

    Since the second quarter of this year, the power supply in the Nanjing power grid has been strained, experiencing an unprecedented peak power load. Industrial electricity consumption has increased by 27% compared to the same period last year due to the surge in production, and electricity used for farmland irrigation has also increased by 17% compared to last year. Other residential electricity consumption has also increased significantly. In order to alleviate the tension in Nanjing's power supply, the Ministry of Electric Power has transferred a train power plant to provide support. This is the fourth train power plant of the Ministry of Electric Power's Train Electric Power Bureau. Its power generation capacity can supply the electricity needs for the production of 50,000 to 60,000 spindles, or the residential electricity for a city of 100,000 people.

    The temporary factory buildings needed for the train power plant have already begun construction. All the employees of this plant are actively preparing for power generation and it is estimated that it will be able to generate electricity officially in two weeks.

    列车电厂开到了南京
    本报讯　一座安装在列车上的发电厂在10月7日从洛阳开到南京，以支援南京、无锡、常州等城市工业用电的需要。
    今年第二季度以来，南京电力网供电紧张，出现了历史上从未有过的电力高峰负荷。工业用电量由于生产的高涨比去年同期增加27％，农田灌溉用的电力也比去年增加17％，其他生活用电也大量增加。为了解除南京电力供应的紧张状态，电力工业部调出一列列车电厂前来支援。这是电力工业部列车电业局第四列车电厂。它的发电能量可供应五、六万纱锭生产的电力需要，或供应一个十万人口城市的生活用电。
    列车电厂所需的临时厂房都已开始兴建。这个厂的全体职工正在积极进行发电的准备工作，估计在两个星期后就可以正式发电了。
