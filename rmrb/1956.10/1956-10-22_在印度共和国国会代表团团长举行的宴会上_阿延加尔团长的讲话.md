Speech by Head of the Indian Republic Parliamentary Delegation, Mr. Ayyangar, at the Banquet Held by the Delegation

Dear Mr. Liu Shaoqi, Dear Mr. Zhou Enlai, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen!

On behalf of myself and the members of the Indian Parliamentary Delegation, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks for accepting our invitation and gracing today's banquet. My colleagues and I arrived here on the 29th of last month to participate in the National Day on October 1st, and have traveled around China, seeing many places, many people, and many things. Wherever we went, you and the people of this great country extended a warm and spontaneous welcome to us; we must express our gratitude. During our three weeks in China, we did not feel like we were in a foreign country. We felt the natural kinship between two great peoples. In many ways, we are alike. Our customs, habits, and ways of life are very similar. Our contact, based on culture and religion, began more than two thousand years ago; after a long interruption, it has now resumed. Your pilgrims to our country brought back the message of peace, enshrining Sakyamuni Buddha – our Lord of Peace – in Chinese temples and in the hearts of the Chinese people. The principle of non-violence advocated by the Buddha for individual conduct was applied by our Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, to national affairs to win freedom from the British who had ruled our country for one hundred and fifty years. Mr. Gandhi felt that both the means and the ends must be peaceful, and we finally obtained freedom from one of the most powerful empires in the world. Our Prime Minister, as a true successor to Mr. Gandhi, propagates the message of peace; this message has been concretely manifested through the "Panchsheel" promoted by the governments of our two countries. These five principles, as models of good conduct for individuals, can equally be applied to nations. Now that we are free nations, we have a responsibility to bring this freedom to other countries, large and small, that are still suffering under colonial rule. As long as one country is still subject to or dominated by another, true world peace is impossible. We must work together to eradicate colonialism from the earth by peaceful means.

Striving and seizing for survival, the law of the jungle where the weak are preyed upon by the strong, is a barbaric rule. The lion and the lamb cannot coexist because the lamb is the lion's food, and the lion would starve to death if it did not kill the lamb. Therefore, strife and seizure are primitive bestiality; beasts are incapable of or do not know how to cooperate or coexist. Applying the laws of barbarism to human relations degrades human dignity and delays the process of evolution. Humanity can replace elimination with coexistence, competition with cooperation, and strife with peace in all relationships, both personal and national. All contradictions originate in the human heart and are concretely manifested in wars and strife. Therefore, the causes of war must be eliminated. This can only be done when humanity has learned to serve rather than to rule, to give rather than to take. All energy must be used to serve people, not to destroy them.

Therefore, a new type of person must emerge, warriors of peace, not warriors of war.

We are extremely pleased to see that this new type of person is growing rapidly in your country and in ours. Wherever we went, we saw young men and women, boys and girls, who were enthusiastic, full of energy, full of hope, and ready to serve the country in unprecedented ways.

They are like flowers in spring, a spring that has come to your country and ours after a long period of frost, foreign oppression, and domestic corruption lasting almost a century. May the new spring of this country never fade, and may the frost never fall again.

During our travels, we also witnessed the development of heavy industries such as steel, machinery, automobiles, and shipbuilding. We are pleased to see that there is great harmony between workers and administration everywhere. The workers showed great enthusiasm for their work, and we were very happy to hear that there have never been any strikes or lockouts. We also visited universities in Beijing and Nanjing. We also saw nurseries, youth palaces, children's palaces, and gymnasiums. These universities are in fact factories, where "human material" is forged and shaped in preparation for national construction. We were very pleased to hear that your higher education is almost free. We also visited your national colleges, where the problems of ethnic minorities are being studied with sympathetic care, and ways and means are being provided to develop the cultures of the various ethnic minorities as the entire country consolidates. Your country is also encouraging the development of arts and technology, and a great cultural movement is underway. Both of our countries have formulated five-year plans for construction and industrialization, and we are both progressing well. In your country, one can see a high tide of enthusiasm, with people eagerly wanting to become strong on the industrial front as soon as possible.

We are also equally pleased to hear that you are taking measures to eliminate urban unemployment and have organized agricultural and handicraft cooperatives to increase production and expand the use of labor. We have had the opportunity to see these cooperatives at work. It may still take considerable time to improve working conditions, such as reducing working hours, increasing wages, and achieving full employment. Efforts in this direction are being carried out with great enthusiasm.

We cannot fail to mention the gracious hospitality of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, a non-official organization whose purpose is to establish closer relations between our two great countries in the fields of literature, society, and culture. They are doing good work, and we have corresponding organizations in our country. Many delegations have come to your country from ours. We hope that as time goes on, more delegations will visit our countries, increase mutual understanding, and strengthen our friendship. We have solemnly joined hands for the cause of mutual assistance and cooperation, mutual coexistence, and the establishment of world peace. We are very happy to see that your young men and women are being trained for the huge task of national construction and for maintaining world peace. May our friendship with each other grow day by day. Let us grow together in prosperity, let us exchange experiences through closer contact, let us cooperate with each other for common progress and to help other Asian and African brothers, let us strive to promote understanding between all countries in the world, and do our best to establish and maintain lasting peace on earth. Let people no longer think of war, nor be threatened by war. Let us all become warriors of peace, and may God assist us in this task.

The evening before last, we had the honor of being received by your Chairman and leader, Mr. Mao. He is a great leader, a brilliant personality, a good friend of India, and a warrior of peace. We thank him for his kindness: receiving us, talking to us, and discussing very frankly the issue of promoting further understanding between our two great countries. We must also mention our ambassador and his wife, who have freely associated with the government and people of your country in their efforts to promote understanding and friendly relations between the two countries, and have become your close friends. We are even more grateful to Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the Standing Committee, who graciously invited us to visit your country in order to bring our two countries closer together. Both of our countries are engaged in great construction, and we have much to learn from each other. We can tell you with satisfaction that we will bring back to our country knowledge of your experiences and your efforts in all areas, which we hope will be of great benefit to us.

We will also bring home many pleasant memories: your great friendship and hospitality and warm welcome, your wishes and hopes for lasting friendly relations between our two countries, and your ardent desire to maintain world peace.

Now I would like to propose a toast to the growing prosperity of the Chinese people, to the lasting friendship between India and China, and to lasting world peace.

    在印度共和国国会代表团团长举行的宴会上
    阿延加尔团长的讲话亲爱的刘少奇先生，亲爱的周恩来先生，阁下们，女士们，先生们！
    蒙你们接受邀请，光临今天的宴会，我谨代表我自己和印度国会代表团的团员，表示衷心的感谢。我和我的同事们在上月29日来到这里，参加了10月1日的国庆，周游了中国各地，看见了许多地方、许多人和许多事物。不论我们到什么地方，你们和这个伟大国家的人民都对我们表示了热烈而自发的欢迎；我们必须表示感谢。我们在中国的三个星期的期间内，没有感到我们是在一个陌生的国家。我们感到两个伟大人民之间的自然的亲切。在很多事情上我们是一样。我们的风俗、习惯和生活方式极其相似。我们之间以文化和宗教为基础的接触，在两千多年以前就开始了；经过了长期的中断，现在又恢复了。你们到我国的朝圣者带回来和平的信息，把释迦牟尼佛——我们的和平之主，供入了中国的庙宇，放进了中国人民的心中。佛为个人行为所倡导的非暴力的原则，曾由我们的国父圣雄甘地应用到国家事务上，来向统治了我国一百五十年的英国人争取自由。甘地先生觉得目的和手段都必须是和平的，而我们终于从世界上最强大的一个帝国那里取得了自由。我们的总理做为甘地先生的真正继承人，宣扬着和平的信息；这个信息经过贵我两国政府提倡的“潘查希拉”而得到了具体的表现。做为个人良好行为典范的这五项原则，同样可以应用于国家上。现在我们已经是获得自由的国家，有责任将这个自由带给仍在殖民统治下遭受苦难的其他大小国家。只要有一个国家还屈服于另一个国家，或受另一个国家的支配，真正的世界和平就是不可能的。我们要共同努力，用和平的办法把殖民主义从地球上消灭。
    为生存而纷争攘夺、弱肉强食，是野蛮的规律。狮子和羔羊不能共同生存，因为羔羊是狮子的食物，而狮子若不杀死羔羊自己就要饿死。因此，纷争攘夺是原始的兽性，野兽是不可能也不知道合作或是共处的。如果把野蛮的规律应用到人类的关系上，就是降低人类的尊严，推迟进化的过程。人类是可以在个人及国家的一切关系上，以共存代替消灭，合作代替竞争，和平代替纷争的。一切矛盾都发自人心，而具体表现在战争和纷争上。因此，必须消灭战争的原因。这一点，只有在人类学会了服务而不是统治、给与而不是夺取，才能办到。一切精力必须使用于为人服务，而不是为了毁灭人。
    因此，必须产生一种新类型的人，他们是和平的战士，而不是战争的战士。
    我们极其高兴地看到，这样新类型的人，正在贵国和我国一样迅速地成长着。不论我们到什么地方，我们都看见了青年男女，男孩子和女孩子们，他们热情洋溢，充满了精力，充满了希望，随时准备着以前所未有的方式为国家服务。
    他们像是春天的花朵，这个春天是在长期霜冻、外人压迫、内政腐败差不多一个世纪的长时期之后方来到贵国和我国的。希望这个国家的新的春天永不消逝，寒霜不再降落。
    在我们旅行时，我们也亲眼目睹了像钢铁、机械、汽车及造船这样的重工业的发展。我们欣然看到各处工人和行政之间存在着极大的调谐。工人们对工作表现了高涨的热情，我们很高兴地听到从来没有罢工和关厂的情况。我们在北京和南京还访问了大学。我们还看到托儿所、青年宫、少年宫和体育馆。这些大学事实上都是工厂，在这里“人的材料”为准备国家的建设锻炼成形。我们听说你们的高等教育几乎是免费的，感到十分欣慰。我们也参观了你们的民族学院，在这里正在以同情的关怀研究少数民族的问题，并随着整个国家的巩固，提供发展各个少数民族的文化的方式方法。贵国也在鼓励着艺术和技术的发展，伟大的文化运动也正在进行。我们两国为了建设和工业化，都制定了五年计划，我们进行得都很好。在贵国可以看到热情的高潮，人们都以急切的心情要在工业阵地上早日变得强大。
    我们也同样高兴地听到，你们在采取措施来消灭城市的失业现象，并且组织了农业及手工业的合作社，以增加生产，扩大劳力的使用。我们曾有机会看到这些合作社进行工作。要改善工作情况，譬如减少工作时间，增加劳动报酬，达到充分就业，也许还需要相当时间。朝着这个方向的努力，正在热情高涨地进行着。
    我们不能不提到中印友好协会对我们的盛情招待，这是一个非官方的组织，目的是为了在我们两个伟大国家之间，在文学、社会及文化的领域中建立更加密切的关系。他们在进行着良好的工作，在我们也有着相应的组织。有许多代表团曾由我国来到贵国。我们希望随着时间的增长，有更多的代表团访问我们的国家，增进互相的了解，加强我们的友谊。我们为了互助合作，互相共存和建立世界和平的事业，已经庄严地携起手来。我们很高兴见到，你们的青年男女都在为了国家建设的庞大任务和为了维系世界和平而接受训练。希望我们相互间的友好，与日俱增。让我们在繁荣中共同成长，让我们以更密切的接触来交流经验，让我们为了共同的进步、也为了帮助其他的亚非兄弟国家而互相合作，让我们努力促进世界所有国家之间的了解，尽最大的力量来建立并维护地球上的永久和平。叫人们不再想到战争，也没有战争的威胁。叫我们都变成和平的战士，愿上帝协助我们这个任务。
    前天晚间，我们曾荣幸地受到你们的主席和领袖毛先生的接见。他是一个伟大的领袖，一个光辉的人格，印度的良友，和平的战士。我们感谢他的盛意：接见了我们，和我们谈话，并且十分坦率地讨论到促进我们两个伟大国家之间进一步了解的问题。我们也必须提到我们的大使和他的夫人，他们在促进两国间的了解和友好关系的努力中，和贵国政府及人民自由交往，成了你们的亲近朋友。我们更要感谢常务委员会委员长刘少奇先生，他为了使我们两国更加接近而盛意地邀请我们前来访问贵国。我们两国都在进行着伟大的建设，我们有许多事要互相学习。我们可以欣慰地奉告诸位，我们此次回国将带回去关于你们的经验和你们在各方面的努力的知识，希望这对我们将有很大的益处。
    我们还要带回家许多愉快的记忆：你们的高谊盛情和热烈的欢迎，你们为了两国间持久友好关系的祝愿和雅望，和你们为了维护世界和平的热烈愿望。
    现在我想提议，为了中国人民的日益繁荣，为了印中两国间持续的友好，为了世界的持久和平而干杯。（附图片）
