Turning Mountain Floods into Water Conservancy
Remarkable Achievements in Flood Diversion and Silt Deposition in Zhangjiakou Prefecture

(Our dispatch) Zhangjiakou Prefecture, Hebei Province, is crisscrossed with gullies. Every time there is heavy rain, mountain floods rush down, carrying fertile silt. In order to maintain the mountainous area's soil and water resources, conserve moisture and increase production, the entire prefecture used more than 3 million workdays this year to repair and newly construct over 5,000 flood diversion channels, intercepting and storing floodwater in stages to irrigate farmland with silt. The crops grown on the silt-irrigated fields are growing sturdily and luxuriantly, generally better than the same crops that have not been silt-irrigated, and the ears of grain are plump and long. Through flood diversion and silt deposition, 150 million cubic meters of floodwater were diverted and stored in the upper reaches, intercepting 20 million cubic meters of silt, thereby reducing siltation in the downstream riverbeds and the Guanting Reservoir.

The farmers along the river demonstrated a high degree of initiative and courage in the work of flood diversion and silt deposition. Agricultural cooperatives, organized by production teams, formed groups of young and middle-aged people to water the land, taking responsibility for watering according to branch canals and sections of land. Whenever a flood rose, they would all turn out, day and night, those who blocked the water, those who watered the land, and those who patrolled the canal embankments. On July 25th, when a mountain flood broke out in Xiangshui沟村, Yangyuan County, Yang Yushan, the production team leader of the village's agricultural production cooperative, immediately led 150 team members to intercept and rescue the flood, preventing it from overflowing, while also diverting the flood to irrigate the land. More than 40 cooperative members jumped into the water to protect the embankments with their bodies, and as a result, not only was the flood prevented, but also 847 mu of land was irrigated with the floodwater, giving hope for increased corn production after it had been hailed twice.

In order to help the areas on the坝上 plateau carry out silt deposition work, fifteen channel management committees and agricultural production cooperatives in Huai'an, Xuanhua, Zhuolu and other counties below the坝上 plateau dispatched eighty-two cadres to Shangdu, Zhangbei, Guyuan and other counties above the坝上 plateau in early July to impart watering techniques and guide watering. Zhangbei, Guyuan and other counties above the坝上 plateau, which were unfamiliar with silt deposition techniques, also sent forty cooperative cadres to the Tongqiao, Chadao and other river channels below the坝上 plateau for on-site study. This played a significant role in carrying out silt deposition work in the坝上 plateau this year. Liujia Township on the west bank of the 不冻河 River in Shangdu County had not been able to irrigate the land since the canal was opened in 1952 until 1955 due to a lack of technical knowledge. This time, with the specific assistance of cadres from the Yaojiafang Agricultural Cooperative in Xuanhua County, 4,700 mu of land were irrigated.

### 变山洪为水利  张家口专区分洪放淤成绩显著

    变山洪为水利
    张家口专区分洪放淤成绩显著
    本报讯　河北省张家口专区，沟峪密布，每遇大雨，山洪夹带着肥沃泥沙奔腾直下。为了保持山区水土资源，保墒增产，今年全专区用工三百多万个，整修和新开洪水渠五千多道，节节拦蓄洪水淤灌农田。淤灌后的田禾生长茁壮茂盛，一般都比未放淤的同种田禾长的好，穗头也又肥又长，经过分洪放淤，在上游分蓄洪水一亿五千万立公方，拦泥二千万立公方，从而减少了下游的河床和官厅水库的淤淀。
    沿河农民在分洪放淤工作中，表现了高度的主动性和勇敢精神。各个农业合作社以生产队为单位组织了青壮年浇地小组，按支渠、按地段负责包浇。一遇洪水涨发，他们就不管白天黑夜一齐出动，挡水的挡水，浇地的浇地，巡渠堤的巡渠堤。阳原县香水沟村7月25日山洪暴发，这个村的农业生产合作社的生产队长杨玉山马上带领一百五十名队员一面截堵抢险，防止洪水漫溢，一面分洪放淤。在抢护渠堤中有四十多名社员跳下水去，用身体挡住漫溢的洪水，结果不但制止了水灾，还利用洪水浇地八百四十七亩，使受过二次雹打的玉米增产有望。
    为帮助坝上地区开展放淤工作，坝下怀安、宣化、涿鹿等县十五个渠道管理委员会和农业生产合作社早在7月初就抽出八十二名干部到坝上商都、张北、沽沅等县传授浇地技术，指导浇地；坝上不熟悉放淤技术的张北、沽沅等县也派出社干部四十人到坝下通桥、岔道等河渠道进行实地学习。这对今年坝上开展放淤工作起了很大作用。商都县不冻河西岸刘家乡因不懂技术自1952年开渠到1955年始终没浇上地，这次在宣化县姚家房农业社干部的具体帮助下，浇地四千七百亩。
