Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, October 10th: The following is an excerpt of the speech given by Fan Ming, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, on October 8th at the inaugural meeting of the Tibetan Branch of the Buddhist Association of China.

The inaugural meeting of the Tibetan Branch of the Buddhist Association of China has opened. This is an auspicious and satisfactory meeting for the Tibetan Buddhist community to gather and discuss important Buddhist matters. It is also a meeting of great unity within the Tibetan Buddhist community. Representatives from various regions, sects, and branches of Tibetan Buddhism are attending this meeting. Undoubtedly, this meeting will further enhance the unity within the Tibetan Buddhist community and the unity of the national Buddhist community, and will further raise the patriotic thought of the Tibetan Buddhist community. This is of great significance for further implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief, promoting Buddhist teachings, developing the Buddhist cause in Tibet, and developing Tibet's political, economic, and cultural undertakings. Therefore, its establishment is in line with the wishes of all monks and laypeople in Tibet. On behalf of the Tibet Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, I extend warm congratulations to the conference and wish the conference a complete success.

Our country is not only a multi-ethnic country, but also a country with a variety of religious beliefs among the people of all ethnic groups. The reactionary ruling classes in history, while implementing a policy of national oppression against the people of all minority nationalities, also adopted policies of discrimination, sabotage, and persecution against the religious beliefs of minority nationalities. After the founding of New China, with the abolition of the policy of national oppression, the freedom of religious belief of minority nationalities has been effectively protected, and freedom of religious belief has become one of the basic policies of our country. Tibet is a region where Buddhism is very developed. The entire people have a deep faith in Buddhism. Historically, Buddhism has played a positive role in the connection and unity of the Tibetan people and in maintaining and spreading Tibetan culture. The Tibetan Buddhist community has a glorious historical tradition of anti-imperialism and patriotism. In the past, when British imperialism invaded Tibet, the Tibetan Buddhist community, together with the Tibetan people, actively carried out heroic and tenacious struggles, giving the invaders a major blow. These heroic deeds of anti-imperialism and patriotism have been recorded in the annals of the motherland and are praised by the people of all ethnic groups in our country, especially the Tibetan people. After the founding of New China, the Tibetan Buddhist community further promoted the fine tradition of anti-imperialism and patriotism, made great contributions to the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and earnestly implemented the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. In supporting the People's Liberation Army's advance into Tibet, consolidating national defense, supporting the construction of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways, and developing various construction undertakings in Tibet, they have contributed great strength and made remarkable achievements. When the Buddhist Association of China was established, Tibetan Buddhist representatives, together with Buddhist representatives from all over the country, solemnly expressed the sacred wish of the Tibetan Buddhist community to love the motherland and love peace. In the peace signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons, the Tibetan Buddhist community actively participated in the signing. After the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, many representatives of the Buddhist community actively participated in the work of various agencies of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region. All of this not only shows that the Tibetan Buddhist community has set a good example in implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief, promoting the teachings of Sakyamuni, and benefiting the people, but also shows that the Tibetan Buddhist community's love for the motherland continues to rise.

As our motherland becomes increasingly prosperous and powerful and its international status rises, the efforts made by the Buddhist community in our country in promoting Buddhism and maintaining world peace have also been respected and valued by Buddhist countries and people in Asia and other regions of the world. We should recognize that only when our country truly achieves democracy, independence, freedom, and equality can the freedom of religious belief of the people of all ethnic groups in our country be effectively guaranteed, and only then can the religious community make beneficial contributions to the motherland, the people, and world peace, thereby enabling religion to achieve correct development. The Tibetan Buddhist community, like the national Buddhist community, loves its own motherland. In the past, every patriotic and world peace-keeping action of the Tibetan Buddhist community has been supported and praised by the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and will receive greater support and praise in the future. However, imperialists and special agents are hostile to the Buddhist community's actions of loving the motherland and loving peace. They will not only carry out sabotage activities openly, but also take more insidious and vicious means to undermine Buddhism. The most common and despicable means they use to undermine religion is to send special agents and other saboteurs to infiltrate the religious community, put on the cloak of religion, and carry out their various criminal activities in the name of religion. They often distort and utilize some good deeds of the religious community, create many sensational rumors in the religious community, incite people's hearts, and provoke unity within the religious community and between the Han and Tibetan nationalities and within Tibet, turning religion into a tool for their counter-revolutionary activities. This is not only detrimental to the country and the people, but also harmful to religion itself. As Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his report on the draft constitution: "Our country will, as in the past, effectively guarantee citizens' right to freedom of religious belief. However, guaranteeing freedom of religious belief and guaranteeing freedom of counter-revolutionary activities are absolutely two different things. Our constitution and all laws will never allow those elements who engage in counter-revolutionary activities under the guise of religion to obtain any convenience." The Tibetan Buddhist community is patriotic and loves the people, so it must always be vigilant, distinguish right from wrong, draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy, and must strictly guard against and resolutely oppose enemies who endanger the country, the people, and religion.

China is a country where Buddhism is widely spread. Not only is the number of people who believe in Buddhism very large, but there are also many schools. In addition to the "Gelug," "Nyingma," "Kagyu," "Sakya," and "Bon" schools in Tibet, there are also various other Buddhist schools in the interior. Therefore, continuing to strengthen the unity between the Tibetan Buddhist community and the national Buddhist community has become a work of great significance. To do this work well, it is necessary to earnestly implement the principle of "each goes its own way, and does not interfere with each other." No matter how many schools of Buddhism there are, how large or small the schools are, how many people believe in them, or how large or small the areas where they are spread, there is always one principle: all should respect each other, help each other, learn from each other, and make progress together. In particular, the larger should take care of the smaller, and the smaller should respect the larger. Only in this way can we truly achieve freedom of belief and do a good job in uniting the Tibetan Buddhist community and all schools in the country.

Tibet is one of the regions in our country where Buddhism is most prosperous. Tibetan Buddhist scriptures are also the richest. In the past and present, there have been many devout Dharma masters in the Tibetan Buddhist community who have profound attainments in Buddhist classics, and have written scriptures and established books, making great contributions to promoting Buddhist teachings and developing the Buddhist cause. This is the glory of the Tibetan Buddhist community. It is hoped that the Tibetan Buddhist community will inherit this glory, excavate the treasure trove of Tibetan Buddhist classics from all aspects, and conduct in-depth and systematic research and collation, compile a history of the development of Tibetan Buddhism, exchange Buddhist culture, and promote Buddhist teachings. This will not only greatly help strengthen the unity between the Tibetan Buddhist community and the national Buddhist community, but also greatly benefit the correct development of religion and the communication of international Buddhist culture, as well as the expansion of the Buddhist community's movement to uphold world peace.

Secondly, I would like to talk about the issue of reform in Tibet, which everyone is very concerned about. Regarding the future direction and policies of reform in Tibet, the Party Central Committee and the People's Government have long clearly stipulated that we will adopt a policy of peaceful consultation, from top to bottom, only allowing good changes and not allowing bad changes. That is to say, the issue of reform must be carefully and repeatedly consulted with the upper strata, so that the vast majority of the upper strata truly support and endorse the reform, and a specific method that satisfies all strata and all aspects is agreed upon before it is implemented. At the same time, before the reform, the government must also try to make appropriate and proper arrangements for the work positions of all upper-class people under the principle of ensuring that the political status and living standards of the upper-class people are not reduced. Some friends suspect that although the central government's policies are very good, will they go awry when they are specifically implemented in Tibet? Due to the deviations and errors that occurred in the implementation of the central government's correct reform policies in individual places in minority areas in the past, such suspicions are very natural. But we must recognize that the Tibetan region is different from any other minority region. It not only has the wise leaders Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni, and the broad masses of people of all strata with a glorious peaceful tradition, but also has cadres of all levels of its own ethnicity who have close ties with the broad masses and have rich political work experience. The Tibet Work Committee and the Tibet Military Region guarantee that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the direct leadership of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni, and together with the people of all strata in Tibet, we will resolutely abide by and implement the correct policies of the Central Committee, resolutely take the road of peaceful consultation from top to bottom, and ensure that the future reform work in Tibet is done well, and ensure that the implementation of the correct reform policies of the Central Committee will not go awry. It is hoped that the broad masses of people of all strata in Tibet will frequently supervise, criticize, and help us. The Tibet Work Committee and the Tibet Military Region are not only willing to sincerely accept any criticism and opinions from the people, but also willing to promptly correct any shortcomings and errors in our work.

Regarding the land belonging to temples, in future reforms, in addition to being the same as the general direction and policies mentioned above, due to the special circumstances and conditions of the temples, more cautious steps and methods must be taken when carrying out reforms. The time for reform must also be postponed, and it must wait until the responsible personnel and lamas of the temples are all willing to reform before starting to carry out the reform. In terms of steps and methods, the responsible personnel and lamas of the temples must formulate methods based on the specific conditions of the temples that are completely suitable for the actual conditions of the temples and are liked and welcomed by all the lamas of the temples before carrying out the reform. In short, when to carry out the reform of temple land, etc., and how to carry out the reform, must be decided by the responsible personnel and lamas of the temples themselves, and they must carry out the reform themselves. No one is allowed to force or take over the reform. Regarding the issue of temple income, the government guarantees that temple income will remain unchanged before the temple is reformed. In the future, after the temples voluntarily and automatically reform, the government will provide appropriate subsidies to the temples and lamas based on the situation, ensuring that their living standards are no lower than before the reform. However, religious friends may still think this way: After the temple is reformed, the income can remain unchanged, and the lives of the lamas will not be a problem, but will religion still develop? Will freedom of religious belief still exist? Regarding the first question, the Dalai Lama spoke very well at the founding meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region. He said: "The fundamental issue of the restoration and development of religion lies in whether the people who believe in religion destroy it or cherish and protect it like life. It is completely different from political reform. At the same time, everyone also knows that if politics cannot develop, the development of religion is also impossible." The Dalai Lama's view is wise and correct, and it is completely in line with the principle of the prosperity of politics and religion in Tibet. That is to say, if Tibet's politics does not develop, the development of religion is also impossible, and in order for politics to develop, it must undergo timely reforms. As for the question of whether there will still be freedom of religious belief after the reform, we can answer this question with history and facts. There is a Chinese saying that is very good: "If you want to ask about the future, look at the past and present." Please first look at the Soviet Union, which has long become a socialist country. They have carried out the largest and most fundamental reforms in human history, but they still retain freedom of religious belief. There are still more than a dozen religions coexisting in the Soviet Union, and there is also Buddhism. Look at our China again. In the vast Han areas and other minority areas, has democratic reform and socialist transformation not also been carried out? Not only has freedom of religious belief been protected by law, but many famous large temples have also been repaired.

Finally, I hope that the monks and laypeople of Tibet will unite, actively promote the spirit of Sakyamuni to relieve the suffering of the people, and strive to build a new Tibet with the prosperity of politics and religion, prosperity, and happiness.

    在中国佛教协会西藏分会成立会议上
    范明同志的讲话
    新华社拉萨10日电　中共西藏工委副书记范明8日在中国佛教协会西藏分会成立会议上讲话（摘要）。
    中国佛教协会西藏分会成立会议已经开幕了，这是西藏佛教界，欢聚一堂，共商佛教大事的一个吉祥如意会议。也是一个西藏佛教界大团结的会议。出席这次会议的有西藏佛教界的各地区、各教派、各宗支的代表。无疑的，通过这次会议将会进一步增强西藏佛教界内部的团结和全国佛教界的团结，将会进一步地提高西藏佛教界的爱国思想。这对进一步贯彻宗教信仰自由的政策，宏扬佛教教义，发展西藏的佛教事业以及发展西藏的政治、经济、文化等事业，都是具有重大意义的。因此它的成立是符合全西藏僧俗人民愿望的。我仅代表中国共产党西藏工作委员会向大会致以热烈地祝贺，并祝大会圆满成功。
    我国不仅是一个多民族的国家，而且也是一个在各民族人民中间具有多种宗教信仰的国家，历史上的反动统治阶级，对各少数民族人民在实行民族压迫政策的同时，对少数民族的宗教信仰也采取歧视、破坏和迫害的政策。新中国成立后，随着民族压迫政策的废除，少数民族的宗教信仰自由也得到切实的保护，宗教信仰自由成为我们国家的基本政策之一。西藏是一个佛教很发达的地区，全体人民对佛教有深厚的信仰，佛教在历史上对于藏族的联系和团结，对于保持和传播西藏的文化等事业方面，起了积极的作用。西藏佛教界有过反帝爱国的光荣历史传统，过去英帝国主义侵略西藏时，西藏佛教界同西藏人民一道，积极地进行了英勇顽强的斗争，给侵略者以重大的打击。这些反帝爱国的英勇事迹，都载入了祖国人民的史册，为我国各族人民特别是西藏人民所传颂。新中国成立后，西藏佛教界进一步发扬了反帝爱国的优良传统，对西藏的和平解放事业作出了巨大的贡献，认真地执行了关于和平解放西藏办法的协议；在支援人民解放军进军西藏，巩固国防，支援修筑康藏、青藏公路以及发展西藏各项建设事业中，都贡献了巨大的力量，做出了显著的成绩。中国佛教协会成立时，西藏佛教代表和全国各地佛教代表一起，庄严地表达了西藏佛教界热爱祖国，热爱和平的神圣心愿；在反对使用原子武器的和平签名运动中，西藏佛教界踊跃地参加了签名；西藏自治区筹备委员会成立后，佛教界的许多代表人士，积极参加了自治区筹备委员会各级机关的各项工作。所有这一切，不但表明西藏佛教界在执行宗教信仰自由政策，宏扬释迦牟尼的教义，为人民造福等方面做出了良好的榜样，而且也表明了西藏佛教界热爱祖国的思想继续不断的在高涨。
    随着我们祖国日益富强和国际地位日益提高，我国佛教界在宏扬佛教、维护世界和平的事业中所做的努力，也受到亚洲和世界其他地区信仰佛教的国家和人民的尊敬和重视。我们应该认识到只有在我们的国家真正得到民主、独立、自由和平等以后，我国各族人民的宗教信仰自由才能得到切实的保障，宗教界才有可能进行对祖国、对人民、对世界和平作出有益的贡献，从而使宗教获得正确的发展。西藏佛教界和全国佛教界一样，都是热爱自己祖国的。过去西藏佛教界的每一个爱国、保卫世界和平的行动，都受到全国各族人民的支持和赞许，今后将会得到更大的支持和赞许。但是帝国主义者和特务分子对于佛教界的爱祖国、爱和平的行动是仇视的，他们不但会公开进行破坏活动，而且还会采取更阴险更恶毒的手段破坏佛教，他们破坏宗教的最常见的卑鄙手段就是派遣特务等破坏分子，混进宗教界内部，披上宗教的外衣，借宗教之名，进行他们的各种罪恶活动，他们往往把宗教界的一些善行加以曲解和利用，在宗教界中制造许多耸人听闻的谣言，煽动人心，挑拨宗教界内部和汉藏民族间以及西藏内部的团结，把宗教变成他们进行反革命活动的工具，这不仅对国家、对人民不利，而且对宗教本身也是有害的。正如刘少奇委员长在宪法草案报告中所指出的：“我们的国家将如同过去一样切实地保障公民有宗教信仰自由的权利，但是，保障宗教信仰自由和保障反革命活动自由，是绝对不能混同的两件事，我们的宪法和一切法律同样是永远不会让那些披着宗教外衣进行反革命活动的分子得到一点方便的。”西藏佛教界是爱国的、爱人民的，因此必须时刻提高警惕，分清是非、划清敌我界限，对危害国家、人民和宗教的敌人，必须加以严密的防范和严厉的反对。
    中国是一个佛教传播很广的国家，不但信仰佛教的人数是很多的，而且也有很多派别，除了西藏有“格鲁”、“宁玛”、“噶居”、“萨迦”、“崩保”等不同的教派外，内地也还有各种其他佛教派。因此，继续增强西藏佛教界和全国佛教界的团结，便成为一件具有重大意义的工作。要做好这一工作，就必须确实执行“各行其是，互不干涉”的原则。不论佛教有几种教派，教派之间大小如何，信仰的人多少如何，传播的地区大小如何，但总的有一条原则就是均应相互尊重，互相帮助，互相学习，共同进步，特别是大的应当照顾小的，小的应该尊重大的，只有这样才能真正做到信仰自由，才能做好西藏佛教界和全国各教派之间的团结。
    西藏是我国佛教最为昌隆的地区之一，西藏佛教经典亦最丰富，过去和现在西藏佛教界有不少虔诚法师，佛学经典造诣高深，并著经立籍，对宏扬佛教教义，发展佛教事业，做出了巨大的贡献。这是西藏佛教界的光荣，希望西藏佛教界继承这种光荣，从各方面发掘西藏佛学经典的宝藏，深入地有系统地加以研究整理，编写西藏佛教发展历史，交流佛教文化，使佛教教义得到宣扬。这不但对加强西藏佛教界和全国佛教界的团结有很大的帮助，而且对正确的发展宗教和沟通国际间的佛教文化以及扩大佛教界的拥护世界和平运动，也将有很大好处。
    其次，我想谈一点大家都很关心的关于西藏进行改革的问题。今后西藏进行改革的方针和政策问题，党中央和人民政府早已明确规定采取和平协商的、自上而下的、只准改好、不准改坏的方针。就是说改革问题必须经过和上层人士认真的反复的协商，作到上层人士绝大多数真正拥护和赞助改革，并且商定一个为各阶层各方面都满意的具体的办法，然后去实行。同时在改革前，政府还要在保证上层人士的政治地位和生活水平都不降低的原则下，设法把所有上层人士的工作职务都作出适当妥善的安排。有的朋友怀疑，中央的政策固然很好，但在西藏具体执行时，是否会走样？由于过去少数民族地区个别地方在执行中央正确的改革政策时出了偏差和错误，这样的怀疑是很自然的。但我们必须认识西藏地区是不同于其他任何少数民族地区的。她不但有英明的领袖达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼，有光荣和平传统的各阶层广大人民，而且有和广大群众有密切联系的和有丰富的政治工作经验的各级本民族干部。西藏工委和西藏军区，保证在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，在达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的直接领导下，和西藏各阶层人民一起，坚决遵守和执行中央的正确政策，坚决走和平协商的自上而下的道路，保证把西藏今后的改革工作做好，保证执行中央正确的改革政策不会走样，希望西藏各阶层广大人民，对我们经常监督、批评和帮助；西藏工委和西藏军区不仅愿意诚恳接受人民的任何批评和意见，并且愿意及时改正在工作中的任何缺点和错误。
    关于寺庙所属的土地，在今后改革中，除了和上述总的方针和政策相同外，由于寺庙的特殊情况和条件，在进行改革时，还须采取更加审慎的步骤和方法。在改革的时间上，还须推迟一些，必须要等待寺庙的负责人员和喇嘛们大家都愿意改革的时候再去开始进行。在步骤和方法上还须由寺庙的负责人员和喇嘛们根据寺庙的具体条件制定出完全适合寺庙实际情况并为寺庙全体喇嘛大家都乐意和欢迎的办法来，再去进行改革。总之，寺庙土地等的改革何时进行以及如何进行，必须由寺庙的负责人员和喇嘛们自己决定，并由他们自己去进行，任何人是不得加以强迫和包办代替的。关于寺庙收入问题，在寺庙未改革前，政府保证寺庙收入不变。将来寺庙自愿自动改革后，由政府按情况给寺庙、喇嘛以适当补助，保证不低于改革前的生活水平。不过宗教界的朋友们，可能还有人这样想：寺庙改革后固然收入可以不变，喇嘛们的生活不成问题，但宗教是否还会发展？宗教信仰是否还会自由？关于第一个问题，达赖喇嘛在自治区筹委会成立大会上讲得很好。他说：“宗教的恢复与发展的基本问题，在于信仰宗教的人们是否破坏它还是像生命一样的重视保护它。它与政治的改革完全是两回事。同时大家也知道，政治不能发展，宗教的发展也是不可能的。”达赖喇嘛的这个见解是英明正确的，是完全适合西藏政教昌隆原则的。这就是说西藏的政治若得不到发展，宗教的发展也是不可能的，而政治要发展，又必须进行适合时宜的改革才有可能。至于改革后宗教信仰是否还有自由问题，我们可以用历史和事实来回答这个问题。中国有句俗话讲的很好：“要问将来，且看过去和现在”，请大家先看看早已成为社会主义国家的苏联，他们进行了人类最大最根本的改革，但他们至今保有宗教信仰的自由。现在苏联还有十几种宗教同时存在，而且还有佛教。再看看我们中国，在广大的汉人地区和其他少数民族地区，不也是进行了民主改革和社会主义改造吗？不但宗教信仰自由得到了法律的保护，而且修复了许多有名的大寺庙。
    最后，希望西藏的僧俗人民团结起来，积极发扬释迦牟尼为解救人民痛苦的精神，为建设一个政教昌隆、繁荣幸福的新西藏而努力。
