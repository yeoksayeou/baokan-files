Xinhua News Agency, October 21st: According to a report by the Yugoslav News Agency, the Romanian government and Romanian Workers' Party delegation arrived in Belgrade on a special train on the afternoon of October 20th. This visit is in response to the visit to Romania in June this year by the Yugoslav government delegation headed by President Tito. The delegation includes Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, member of the Presidium of the Romanian National Assembly and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Chivu Stoica, among others.

Yugoslav President Tito, Chairman of the Federal National Assembly, Pijade, and Vice Presidents of the Federal Executive Council, Kardelj, Ranković, Vukmanović and Djuraković went to the station to welcome the Romanian delegation. Tens of thousands of Belgrade residents also gave the distinguished guests a grand welcome in the square in front of the station.

Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej addressed the welcoming crowd. He pointed out that the friendship and cooperation between Romania and Yugoslavia has a long historical root, which stems from their centuries-long common struggle for their national independence.

When talking about the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej emphasized that the proactive actions of the leaders of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia are of great significance for all socialist countries and the workers' movement around the world. The Romanian government and the Romanian Workers' Party have taken a series of measures to promote the complete establishment of friendly relations between us, based on the spirit of the Belgrade and Moscow Declarations.

Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej said that for the construction of socialism, the exchange of experiences between the two sides is of great importance, as is learning from the experiences already gained, and each side can make its own contribution to this matter. He said that we believe this is an integral part of the internationalist cooperation between communist and workers' parties for the development and strengthening of progressive forces and for world peace.

    罗马尼亚代表团到南斯拉夫
    乔治乌—德治强调双方要交流经验
    新华社21日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社报道，罗马尼亚政府和罗马尼亚工人党代表团10月20日下午乘专车到达贝尔格莱德。这次访问是对于今年6月间以铁托总统为首的南斯拉夫政府代表团对罗马尼亚的访问的回答。代表团人员中有罗马尼亚国民议会主席团委员、罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会第一书记乔治乌—德治和部长会议主席斯托伊卡等人。
    南斯拉夫总统铁托和联邦国民议会主席皮雅杰，联邦执行委员会副主席卡德尔·兰科维奇、伏克曼诺维奇和乔拉柯维奇等都到车站去欢迎罗马尼亚代表团。在车站前面的广场上还有几万贝尔格莱德居民对贵宾们表示盛大的欢迎。
    乔治乌—德治向欢迎群众讲了话。他指出，罗马尼亚同南斯拉夫的友谊和合作有着悠久的历史根源，这种根源是来自它们为了它们的民族独立而进行的数百年之久的共同斗争。
    乔治乌—德治在谈到苏联和南斯拉夫之间的关系正常化时着重指出，苏南两国领导人的主动行动，对于所有社会主义国家和全世界的工人运动，都有巨大的意义。罗马尼亚政府和罗马尼亚工人党据根贝尔格莱德和莫斯科宣言的精神，已经采取了一系列的措施来促进我们之间的友好关系的完全建立。
    乔治乌—德治说，对于建设社会主义来说，双方交流经验同互相学习已经获得的经验一样，是具有巨大的重要意义的，每一方对这件事都可以作出自己的贡献。他说，我们认为这是共产党和工人党为了发展和加强进步力量以及为了全世界和平而进行的国际主义合作的组成部分。
