    Lu Xun Quotes
    A race with many people who are not complacent will always move forward and always have hope.
    A race with many people who only know how to blame others and not reflect on themselves is doomed!
            ——"Random Thoughts: 'Discontent'"

    Immaturity to maturity is like a child to an old man, and there is nothing shameful about it; the same is true of works. Starting out immature is not shameful, because if it is not destroyed, it will grow, mature, and become seasoned; only aging and decay are incurable!
    ——"Grave: 'Before the Appearance of Genius'"

    鲁迅语录
    多有不自满的人的种族，永远前进，永远有希望。
    多有只知责人不知反省的人的种族，祸哉祸哉！
            ——热风：“不满”
    幼稚对于老成，有如孩子对于老人，决没有什么耻辱；作品也一样，起初幼稚，不算耻辱的。因为倘不遭了戕贼，他就会生长，成熟，老成；独有老衰和腐败，倒是无药可救的事！
    ——坟：“未有天才之前”
