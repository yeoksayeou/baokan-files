Harvest season has arrived! The once desolate "Great Northern Wilderness" is now also filled with joyous scenes of autumn harvest. Young pioneers are reaping the fruits of their year of hard work.

The volunteer land reclamation team from Shandong Province, which planted major autumn crops on 6,800 hectares of newly reclaimed wasteland in Longjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, has achieved a bumper harvest. Each team member will receive approximately 350 yuan during the autumn harvest distribution. Many team members plan to bring their families here, intending to settle on this land for the long term. Look! How happy this young man is, holding the fruits of his labor. Land reclamation team members of New Village No. 7 in Longjiang County are driving horses and operating rocker-arm harvesters, busily harvesting millet on the newly reclaimed land.

    新开垦的荒地上的丰收
    收获季节来到了！过去渺无人烟的“北大荒”，今年也呈现出一片欢乐的秋收景象，青年拓荒者们正在收获一年辛勤劳动结出的果实。
    从山东省来到黑龙江省龙江县的志愿垦荒队，在六千八百公顷新开垦的荒地上种植的大秋作物，获得丰收，平均每个队员在秋收分配时能收入三百五十元左右。许多队员都要把家眷接来，他们打算长期在这块土地上住下去。瞧！这青年小伙子抱着自己劳动的果实，有多高兴。龙江县第七号新村的垦荒队员们赶着马、驾着摇臂收割机，在新开垦的土地上忙碌地收割谷子。
