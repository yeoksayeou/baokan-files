Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th Dispatch: According to TASS, the delegations of the governments of the Soviet Union and Japan began negotiations in Moscow at 12:00 on October 15 regarding the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Japan. The first meeting was held on the 15th.

The negotiations were conducted in a friendly atmosphere, based on mutual understanding and the desire to quickly normalize Soviet-Japanese relations.

The two sides decided to appoint Gromyko and Shunichi Matsumoto, plenipotentiaries from their respective government delegations, to preliminarily discuss the relevant agreed-upon documents and submit them to the Soviet and Japanese government delegations for processing.

The Soviet side participating in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations included: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR Bulganin (head of the delegation), Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR Khrushchev, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR Mikoyan, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR Gromyko, and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR Fedrin.

The Japanese side participating in the negotiations included: Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Ichiro Kono, and Member of the House of Representatives of the Diet Shunichi Matsumoto.

Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR Bulganin delivered an opening speech at the first meeting. On behalf of the Soviet government, he welcomed the Japanese Prime Minister and the Japanese government delegation to Moscow.

Bulganin said that the Soviet government is beginning negotiations on the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations based, as in the past and present, on its consistent peaceful policy of conducting business cooperation with all countries, and on the policy of peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems. The Soviet government believes that restoring peaceful and good-neighborly relations between our two countries can not only end the state of war between the Soviet Union and Japan, but also open up broad avenues for economic and cultural cooperation in accordance with the interests of the two peoples, and is conducive to strengthening peace in the Far East.

Bulganin pointed out that the Soviet Union sincerely desires to live in peace with Japan and, taking into account its wishes, made concessions to the Japanese side in previous negotiations on the conclusion of a peace treaty, including on territorial issues. However, despite this, Japan is still unwilling to sign a peace treaty and has suggested to us that we should not conclude a peace treaty at present but first achieve the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations, so that we can continue negotiations on the conclusion of a peace treaty, including territorial issues, after restoring diplomatic relations between our two countries.

We agree with these wishes of the Japanese side.

During the negotiations on the conclusion of a peace treaty in London and Moscow, both sides clearly stated their positions on the issues under discussion and reached agreement on almost all clauses of the treaty.

The letters exchanged between the two sides in September of this year show that we can consider that we have reached a mutual understanding and have in fact laid the foundation for the restoration of diplomatic and good-neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Japan.

Bulganin concluded by saying that all of this will help us solve our current tasks, and we hope that these negotiations will be successfully completed.

Next, Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama spoke. He said that ending the state of war as soon as possible and restoring mutual relations between Japan and the Soviet Union to promote peace in the Far East and contribute to the cause of lasting world peace is my long-cherished wish.

Hatoyama also talked about the fact that the Soviet and Japanese sides had reached agreement on many issues in the past negotiations. He said, however, that because no agreement could be reached on the territorial issue, normal relations have not yet been restored. In order to break the deadlock and find a way out, I wrote you a letter on September 11 this year, in which I requested the Soviet side to agree to continue negotiations on the territorial issue in the future, and at the same time requested the Soviet side to agree to the following five points: (1) end the state of war between the two countries, (2) exchange diplomatic envoys at the ambassadorial level, (3) immediately repatriate Japanese citizens remaining in the Soviet Union, (4) put the fisheries treaty signed on May 14, 1956 into effect, and (5) the Soviet Union support Japan's proposal to accept Japan as a member of the United Nations; and suggested that, to the extent possible, a resolution be passed on those issues on which the two sides reached agreement in the negotiations in London and Moscow. Based on this view, I propose negotiations on the normalization of relations between the two countries.

Hatoyama said that I have come to Moscow now based on the above-mentioned views, personally to frankly exchange opinions in order to restore relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. I sincerely hope that the representatives of the Soviet and Japanese governments can find a mutually satisfactory solution through friendly negotiations.

The two sides agreed that the date of the next meeting of the government delegations of the Soviet Union and Japan would be decided later.

People's Daily, Moscow, 16th Dispatch: At 12:00 noon on October 15, Bulganin, Khrushchev, Mikoyan and other Soviet government leaders and the Japanese government delegation headed by Ichiro Hatoyama entered the Kremlin conference hall. The two sides shook hands and exchanged greetings before holding talks. The first meeting adjourned after forty minutes in a pragmatic atmosphere. Both sides designated plenipotentiary representatives to draft a mutually agreed document and submit it to both delegations. Moscow journalists anticipate that, in all likelihood, all conditions are now in place for establishing normal diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Japan.

This judgment was deepened by the following fact: After the first meeting, Bulganin hosted an early banquet to welcome Ichiro Hatoyama. Although no formal speeches were made at the banquet, which was attended by all members of the two delegations, the atmosphere was unrestrained and lively, and the hosts and guests repeatedly toasted to the early establishment of normal Soviet-Japanese relations.

Everyone paid close attention to a sentence made by Ichiro Hatoyama at the first meeting. He said: Ending the state of war as soon as possible and establishing mutual relations with the Soviet Union is the basic line of his cabinet's foreign policy. Therefore, one journalist said that this was the first time in Ichiro Hatoyama's life that he had personally visited Russia, although he is now very inconvenient to move around due to health reasons. In this context, Ichiro Hatoyama's trip to the Soviet Union via Europe, despite the long distance, is highly valued by the Soviet side, as Bulganin pointed out. This assessment primarily includes the efforts made by the Japanese Prime Minister to establish Japanese-Soviet relations.

A large number of Japanese journalists have come to Moscow to cover the Soviet-Japanese negotiations. From them, we learned about some of the trends in Japanese public opinion. A commentator in the "Yomiuri Shimbun" wrote: "This time (referring to this Soviet-Japanese negotiation), there is no doubt that a document on the restoration of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Japan will be signed. After Japan and the Soviet Union establish peaceful relations, the issue of restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and Communist China will immediately be put on the agenda." However, according to a report from the United States by a Japanese news agency reporter, U.S. government officials are very concerned about the next step after the Soviet Union and Japan restore normal relations. It is not difficult to understand that this news implies that the path to Japan's independent prosperity through the restoration of friendly relations with its neighbors will not be "smooth sailing."

It is understood that the date of the second meeting of the Soviet-Japanese talks will depend on the progress of the work of the plenipotentiary representatives.

    布尔加宁在苏日谈判第一次会议上说
    苏联根据和平政策将谋求谈判达成协议
    鸠山表示希望尽快结束战争状态恢复相互关系
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联和日本两国政府代表团于10月15日12时在莫斯科开始举行关于苏联和日本之间的关系正常化的谈判。15日举行了第一次会议。
    双方本着互相谅解和迅速使苏日关系正常化的愿望，在友好气氛中进行了谈判。
    双方决定从双方政府代表团中推出全权代表葛罗米柯和松本俊一，委托他们初步讨论有关的已经达成协议的文件，并且把它们提交苏日两国政府代表团处理。
    苏联方面参加这次苏日谈判的有：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁（代表团团长）、苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫、苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬、苏联外交部第一副部长葛罗米柯和苏联外交部副部长费德林。
    日本方面参加谈判的有：日本首相鸠山一郎、农林相河野一郎和国会众议院议员松本俊一。
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在第一次会议上致开幕词。他代表苏联政府欢迎日本首相和日本政府代表团到莫斯科来。
    布尔加宁说，苏联政府就苏日关系正常化开始谈判，过去和现在都是根据它一贯不渝的同所有国家进行事务合作的和平政策，根据各种不同社会制度国家和平共处的政策。苏联政府认为，我们两国之间恢复和平和睦邻关系，不仅可以结束苏日之间的战争状态，并且可以按照两国人民的利益开辟双方广泛的经济文化合作的道路，有利于加强远东和平。
    布尔加宁指出，苏联真诚地渴望同日本和平相处并且考虑到它的愿望，在以往举行的缔结和约的谈判中向日本方面作出让步，包括在领土问题上。但是，虽然如此，日本仍然不愿意签订和约，并且向我们建议目前不缔结和约而先行实现苏日关系正常化，以便在我们两国恢复外交关系后再继续就缔结包括领土问题的和约进行谈判。
    我们同意日本方面的这些愿望。
    在伦敦和莫斯科关于缔结和约的谈判过程中，双方都就讨论中的问题清楚地阐明了自己的立场，并且几乎就这个条约的全部条款取得协议。
    今年9月间双方交换的信件表明，我们可以认为我们之间已经达到相互谅解，并且事实上已经为恢复苏联和日本的外交关系和睦邻关系打下基础。
    布尔加宁最后说，所有这一切都有助于我们解决我们目前的任务，我们希望这次的谈判将顺利地完成。
    接着是日本首相鸠山一郎讲话。他说，尽快结束战争状态，恢复日苏间相互关系，以促进远东和平，有利于世界持久和平的事业——这是我向来的宿愿。
    鸠山也谈到在过去的谈判中苏日双方在许多问题上已经取得了一致。他说，但是，因为在领土问题上不能取得协议，所以至今没有能恢复正常关系。为了打开局面，找寻出路，我在今年9月11日写给你一封信，在信中我请求苏联方面同意今后继续就领土问题进行谈判，同时请求苏联方面能同意下列五点：（一）结束两国之间的战争状态，（二）互派大使级外交使节，（三）立刻遣返留在苏联的日本公民，（四）使1956年5月14日签订的渔业条约生效，（五）苏联支持日本提出的关于接受日本为联合国会员国的申请；并且建议，在可能范围内就双方在伦敦和莫斯科谈判中取得一致意见的那些问题通过决议。根据这种见解，我建议进行关于两国关系正常化的谈判。
    鸠山说，我现在来到莫斯科正是根据上述见解，亲自来坦率地交换意见，以便恢复日本同苏联的关系。我真诚地希望苏日两国政府代表之间能通过友好的谈判求得双方都满意的解决办法。
    双方同意，苏联和日本两国政府代表团下次会议的日期以后再决定。
    本报莫斯科16日电　10月15日中午12时，布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫、米高扬等苏联政府领导人和以鸠山一郎为首的日本政府代表团走入克里姆林宫会议厅，双方握手寒暄后即进行会谈。首次会议在实事求是的空气中进行了四十分钟后休会，双方指定全权代表起草一致同意的文件向双方代表团提出。莫斯科的新闻界人士预料：照一切迹象看来现在建立苏日正常外交关系的一切条件都具备了。
    这种判断又被这样一件事实加深了印象：在首次会谈结束后，布尔加宁设早宴欢迎鸠山一郎。在双方代表团人员全都出席的早宴上，虽然由于日本方面的提议不作正式发言，但气氛是无拘束和活跃的，宾主数次为尽快建立苏日正常关系而干了杯。
    大家对鸠山一郎在首次会议上的这样一句话很注意。他说：尽快结束战争状态和同苏联建立相互关系是他的内阁对外政策的基本路线。因此，有位记者说，这次是鸠山一郎一生中第一次亲临俄罗斯，虽然他现在由于健康关系行动十分不便。在这种情况下，鸠山一郎这次不远千里绕道欧洲而来苏，正如布尔加宁所指出的，苏联方面是给予很高的估价的，这种估价中首先包括日本首相为建立日苏关系而作的努力。
    为了采访苏日谈判，大批日本记者来到了莫斯科。从他们那里，知道了一些日本舆论的动向。日本的一位评论员在“读卖新闻”上写道：“这一次（指这次苏日谈判），无疑将签订苏日恢复外交关系的文件。日苏建立和平关系后，日本和共产党中国恢复外交关系的问题将立刻提到议事日程上来。”但是，据日本通讯社记者来自美国的消息，美国政府人士很为苏日一旦恢复正常关系后的下一步感到不安。不难理解，这条消息暗示着，在日本同它的邻国恢复友好关系这条影响到日本独立繁荣的路上，将不会是“一帆风顺”的。
    据了解，苏日会谈何时举行第二次会议，将看双方全权代表工作的进展程度而定。（附图片）
