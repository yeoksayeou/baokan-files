Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st - When the news of the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration in Moscow reached Tokyo, it was already late at night. Newspapers rushed to publish special editions. They were quickly snapped up on the streets. Crowds of people gathered in squares around the city to listen to radio broadcasts of the press communiqué regarding the signing of the Joint Declaration.

The news of the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations has aroused enthusiastic responses from all walks of life. While emphasizing the great significance of the restoration of normal relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, people have been commenting on the issue of Japan's future implementation of an independent and autonomous foreign policy. Suzuki Mosaburo, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, said in Fukushima on the 20th that with the restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, Japan should now begin a new foreign policy. He said that now is the time for Japan to correct its past policy of reliance on the United States. He pointed out that the next step Japan should take is to recognize the Chinese government and restore diplomatic relations with mainland China.

Former Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Sadayuki Iguchi, wrote an article in the "Yomiuri Shimbun" saying that, in diplomacy, the agreement with the Soviet Union should lead to a new period of Japanese diplomacy, which, while based on friendship with the United States, should also emphasize relations with Asia. He believes that it is dangerous for Japan to try to seek leadership in Asia. Iguchi advocated reviewing Japan's policy towards the United States together with the opposition parties.

Within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, the party leaders who support Hatoyama believe that the negotiations were successful. However, the opposition faction within the party, the "Situation Discussion Group," expressed dissatisfaction with the outcome of the negotiations and vehemently criticized Hatoyama. The leading figure of this group, former Finance Minister of the Yoshida Cabinet, Hayato Ikeda, made a statement in Kamaishi City, Iwate Prefecture today, threatening that he could not bear political responsibility for the Joint Declaration. If this leads to a split in the Liberal Democratic Party, "there is no way to avoid it."

The ruling party and the government have initially decided to convene a special session of the Diet in mid-November to ratify the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration. Interim Prime Minister Shigemitsu Aoi visited the leaders of major political parties on the 19th, asking for their support for the ratification of the Joint Declaration. However, Hayato Ikeda said today that he and his group will vote against it.

It is generally estimated that the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration will be ratified in the Diet, because the left-wing parties, which occupy more than one-third of the seats in the Diet, have repeatedly stated that they agree to ratify the Joint Declaration.

    苏日宣言在日本引起热烈反应
    政界人士纷纷主张开始采取新的外交政策
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：当苏日联合宣言在莫斯科签字的消息传到东京的时候，已经是深夜了。报纸赶紧出版号外。它们在街上很快地被抢购一空。成群的人们聚集在各地广场上倾听关于联合宣言签字的新闻公报的广播。
    苏日关系正常化的消息在各阶层中引起热烈的反应。人们在强调苏日恢复正常关系本身的重大意义的同时，纷纷评论日本今后执行独立自主的外交政策问题。日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎20日在福岛说，随着同苏联恢复邦交，日本现在应该开始新的外交政策。他说，现在是日本改正过去的依赖美国的政策的时候了。他指出，日本应该采取的下一个步骤是：承认中国政府和恢复同中国大陆的外交关系。
    前日本驻美国大使井口贞夫在“读卖新闻”上写文章说，在外交上，同苏联的协议应该导致日本外交的新时期，这种外交虽然应当以同美国友好为基础，同时还应该强调同亚洲的关系。他认为，日本如果想争取亚洲的领导权，那是危险的。井口主张同各反对党一道审查日本对美国的政策。
    在执政党自由民主党内部，支持鸠山的党的领袖们认为谈判是成功的。但是，党内的反对派“时局恳谈会”却对谈判的结果表示不满，对鸠山大肆抨击。这个集团的首脑人物、前吉田内阁藏相池田勇人今天在岩手县釜石市发表谈话威胁说，他不能对联合宣言承担政治责任。如果因此使自由民主党发生分裂“也没有办法”。
    执政党和政府已经初步决定在11月中旬召开国会特别会议，来批准苏日联合宣言。临时代理首相重光葵在19日访问了各主要政党的领袖，要求他们支持批准联合宣言。但是，池田勇人今天却说，他和他的集团将投反对票。
    一般估计，苏日联合宣言将在国会中被批准，因为占国会三分之一以上议席的左翼党派已经一再表示它们赞同批准联合宣言。
