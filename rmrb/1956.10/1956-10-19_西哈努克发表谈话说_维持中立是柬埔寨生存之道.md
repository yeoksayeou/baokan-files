Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th: Phnom Penh Dispatch: Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who recently resigned as Prime Minister of Cambodia, said in an interview with the United Press that Cambodia does not participate in "blocs." It only wants to give its people more justice and happiness, and live peacefully and friendly with all countries. He also said that Cambodia is a country with limited manpower, undeveloped industry, and surrounded by powerful neighbors, and it has chosen neutrality and international cooperation to protect its national survival.

When talking about his views on world issues, Prince Sihanouk said that the most important issues facing the world today are not very different from the problems found in Cambodia. He emphasized that all simple and upright people first hope to maintain peace. They are anxiously watching the nuclear weapons or conventional weapons that major powers are currently accumulating as tools for mass destruction. At the same time, the people of all countries also hope to maintain their independence and establish correct relations with the people of other countries, and establish friendly relations if possible.

Sihanouk said: In Cambodia, the People's Socialist Community, of which I have the honor to be the chairman, is fighting against feudal groups and the colonial specter on the one hand, and fighting against ignorance and poverty on the other, which will pave the way for revolution. He also said that Cambodia is trying to build a "realistic and humane socialism," which will gradually change the moral and material living conditions of the Cambodian people.

Sihanouk also expressed his gratitude for American "aid" in the conversation.

Sihanouk pointed out that Cambodia must do everything possible to restore its position in Asia and live up to the trust placed in it by the world. Therefore, Cambodia must develop and improve its agricultural production, and establish light industry and develop education.

Sihanouk said: We have made guarantees to our people regarding all democratic freedoms.

    西哈努克发表谈话说
    维持中立是柬埔寨生存之道
    新华社河内18日电　金边消息：最近辞去柬埔寨首相职务的西哈努克亲王在对合众社发表的一篇谈话中说：柬埔寨不参加“集团”，它只是想给它的人民以更多的正义和幸福，并且和一切国家友好和平地相处。他还说：柬埔寨是一个人力有限、工业不发达和被强大的邻国所包围的国家，它选择了中立和国际合作来保护它的民族生存。
    在谈到对世界问题的看法的时候，西哈努克亲王说，今天摆在世界面前的最重要的问题和在柬埔寨所发现的问题并没有很大的不同。他强调指出：一切单纯而正直的人首先都希望维护和平。他们不安地注视着大国目前正在积聚的核子武器或者常规武器这种进行大规模毁灭的工具。同时，各国人民还希望维护他们的独立，并且同其他国家的人民建立正确的关系，如果可能的话建立友好关系。
    西哈努克说：在柬埔寨，我很荣幸在其中担任主席的人民社会同盟一方面正在同封建集团和殖民幽灵进行斗争，另一方面正在同无知和贫困进行斗争，这将铺平走向革命的道路。他还说柬埔寨正在设法建设一种“现实的和合乎人道的社会主义”，这将逐渐地改变柬埔寨人民的道德和物质生活的条件。
    西哈努克在谈话中还对美国的“援助”表示感谢。
    西哈努克指出，柬埔寨必须尽一切力量来恢复它在亚洲的地位和不辜负全世界对它的信任。因此，柬埔寨必须进行发展和改进它的农业生产的工作，并且建立轻工业和发展教育事业。
    西哈努克说：我们已经向我们的人民作出关于一切民主自由的保证。
