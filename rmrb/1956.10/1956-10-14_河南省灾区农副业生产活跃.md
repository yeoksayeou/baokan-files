Active Agricultural and Sideline Production in Disaster Areas of Henan Province

(Reported by this newspaper) The disaster areas of Henan Province are very active in autumn protection, draining water to plant vegetables, and developing sideline production.

Of the 24 million mu of farmland in the province affected by flooding, more than 90% has had the accumulated water drained. After several rounds of crash planting, the province has sown late autumn crops and vegetables on at least five million mu. Due to timely topdressing and other field management, the late autumn crops and vegetables planted in the rush are generally growing well.

Simultaneous with the crash planting of crops, agricultural cooperatives in the disaster areas have extensively developed sideline production. According to surveys, there are more than eighty types of sideline occupations organized in various places. After developing sideline production, agricultural cooperatives in disaster areas such as Huaibin, Runan, and Zhengyang counties, in addition to earning 45,300 yuan in cash, used the income from sideline occupations to buy back more than 39,000 jin of seeds, as well as fodder, feed, and rations. Xixian County originally had 310,000 disaster victims, and after sideline occupations were developed, the livelihood difficulties of more than 90,000 people before the autumn harvest were partially resolved. In Neihuang County, Anyang Prefecture, more than 10,000 people participated in transportation, milling, processing, construction, and other sideline production activities, earning a total income of 161,400 yuan. The Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in this county has suffered disasters for years, and this year's disaster is even more severe. Because sideline production such as weaving and milling was started before the water receded, it earned more than 7,100 yuan in twenty days in early and mid-September, and the cooperative members with livelihood difficulties were able to maintain their lives by relying on sideline production. In Xuchang Prefecture, more than 300 cadres were transferred from Wuyang, Lushan, Lin颍 and other eight counties to go deep into the agricultural cooperatives to help each cooperative plan sideline production. These counties have signed more than 2,000 processing and purchasing contracts.

Party and government leading organs at all levels in Henan Province attach great importance to production and self-rescue in disaster areas. Recently, more than 60 million yuan in relief funds and production loans have been allocated to disaster areas throughout the province; approximately 200 million jin of wheat seeds have been transferred. Commercial, grain, and supply and marketing cooperative departments have supplied large amounts of cotton, grain, and coal, respectively. In order to allow the people in the disaster areas to make winter clothing, the 600,000 bolts of homespun cloth planned for supply are being transferred to the disaster areas. (Lu Jiang)

    河南省灾区农副业生产活跃
    本报讯　河南省灾区，保秋、排水种菜和副业生产都很活跃。
    全省遭受水涝的二千四百万亩农田中，已有90％以上排除了积水。经过几次抢种，全省已种下的晚秋、蔬菜，至少在五百万亩以上。由于及时进行了追肥等田间管理，抢种的晚秋作物和蔬菜一般都生长得很好。
    和抢种农作物同时，受灾的各农业社广泛开展了副业生产。据调查，各地组织的副业有八十多种。淮滨、汝南、正阳等县灾区农业社在开展副业生产后，除收入现金四万五千三百元外，并用副业收入买回种籽三万九千多斤及饲草、饲料、口粮等。息县原有灾民三十一万人，副业搞起来以后，已有九万多人秋收前的生活困难部分得到解决。安阳专区的内黄县有一万多人参加运输、磨粉、加工、修建等副业生产活动，共已获得收入十六万一千四百元。这个县的曙光农业社连年受灾，今年受灾更严重，因为水没退的时候就搞起编织，磨粉等副业生产，9月上中旬二十天内就赚了七千一百多元，全社生活困难的社员依靠副业生产得以维持生活。许昌专区的舞阳、鲁山、临颍等八县，抽调干部三百多人，深入农业社帮助各个社规划副业生产。这些县已签订了加工、收购合同二千多项。
    河南省各级党政领导机关对于灾区生产自救都很重视。最近，全省灾区拨发了救济款和生产贷款六千多万元；调拨麦种约二亿斤。商业、粮食和供销合作社等部门，分别供应了大量的棉花、粮食和煤。为了让灾区人民添制冬衣，计划供应的六十万匹土布，正源源向灾区调运。　（鲁江）
