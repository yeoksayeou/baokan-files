　　Vigorously Increase New Varieties of Building Materials
　　Lai Jifa, Minister of the Building Materials Industry

    In the reports made by Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, it was clearly pointed out that we must strive to produce more building materials and strengthen the construction of the building materials industry. We will work hard in our practical work to realize the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party.

    In the past few years, the building materials industry, whether directly operated by the central government or operated by local governments, has achieved corresponding development along with the large-scale basic construction in our country, thus basically ensuring the needs of national economic construction and laying a certain foundation for further development in the future. However, building materials must not only meet the requirements of various departments of the national economy for various materials in terms of quantity, but also in terms of variety. The lack of variety is precisely the weak link of the building materials industry. At present, apart from cement, flat glass, bricks, tiles, lime, sand, stone, building sanitary ceramics, and asbestos tiles, there are almost no other new varieties. Even in the existing varieties, the types are very incomplete. For example, there are more than twenty varieties of cement in the Soviet Union, while we only have twelve. There are seventy-five varieties of glass in the Soviet Union, while we only have four. There are more than twenty varieties of asbestos cement pipes in the Soviet Union, while we only have a few. Reinforced concrete components, which can save a lot of steel and wood, have been widely used in the Soviet Union, while we can only produce a small amount. Lightweight concrete blocks and silicate blocks, some new types of building materials, we still don't know how to manufacture. Various materials that can make buildings economical and beautiful have not yet been organized for production in a planned manner.

    All this shows that the lack of variety in the building materials industry cannot meet the needs of national economic construction. In addition to variety, building materials also have serious shortcomings such as low quality and high cost. These shortcomings and backwardness must be overcome through hard work. Therefore, in addition to resolutely striving to complete and overfulfill the first five-year plan, we must also actively prepare for the realization of the second five-year plan.

    Now I would like to put forward the following points on increasing the variety of building materials:

    First, vigorously develop the cement industry and actively increase new varieties to ensure the needs of various projects. At present, it is necessary to advocate the method of saving cement in various projects, but it is also very important to increase cement production and cement varieties, and expand the scope of cement use. The types of construction projects in our country will increase day by day. If the same variety of cement is used in different projects, it will not only delay the construction speed and increase the project cost, but also affect the project quality and even shorten the life of the building. For example, dam cement with low heat of hydration must be used to build the dams of water conservancy projects to ensure the quality of the project. If ordinary cement is used, cracks will occur and it will be easily damaged. For example, concrete projects made of ordinary cement generally take twenty-eight days to reach their due strength, which obviously cannot meet the requirements of emergency projects. If high-alumina cement or quick-setting cement is used, it can reach its due strength in three days, thereby greatly accelerating the progress of project construction. In addition, expansion cement for waterproof projects, non-shrinking cement for moisture-proof and waterproof projects, sulfate-resistant cement for seawater projects, oil well cement for petroleum drilling projects, road cement with high wear resistance and impact strength, white cement for decoration, and plastic cement that can save cement consumption, etc., are all new varieties that we must increase in order to meet the needs of national economic construction. Increasing the production of cement products, such as large reinforced concrete blocks and lightweight concrete blocks, is an important way to achieve "more, faster, better, and more economical" basic construction. For example, the cost of lightweight concrete blocks is only about 15 yuan per cubic meter, while the cost of brick blocks is 30 to 35 yuan per cubic meter, which is about twice as expensive. Moreover, due to the different weights of the two, the freight of lightweight concrete can be saved by three-fifths over the same distance, and half of the construction workers can be saved in construction. Especially in areas with greater earthquake impact, lightweight materials are an indispensable building material.

    Second, in the case of insufficient steel and wood resources in our country, expanding the variety and scope of use of reinforced concrete products and doing everything possible to replace steel and wood with reinforced concrete products is of great significance. For example, railway and highway bridges, high-voltage line towers, railway sleepers, and coal mine pit props can all be replaced with reinforced concrete. According to calculations, if reinforced concrete structures are used to replace steel structures, 8,500 tons of steel can be saved for every 100,000 square meters of building area. The steel tower for erecting one kilometer of power transmission line requires 11.7 tons of steel and costs 10,300 yuan. If reinforced concrete towers are used instead, only 8 tons of steel are needed, costing 8,000 yuan, saving 3.7 tons of steel and reducing the cost by nearly a quarter. If the newly built 10,000 kilometers of railways are all laid with reinforced concrete sleepers, 3 million cubic meters of wood can be saved. A reinforced concrete sleeper only costs 16.94 yuan and can be used for 40 years, with an average annual usage fee of only 0.42 yuan. Although a wooden sleeper only costs 10 yuan, it can only be used for five years, with an average annual usage fee of 2 yuan. For example, if reinforced concrete is used instead of pit wood supports required by coal mines, 2 cubic meters of wood can be saved for every 100 tons of coal mined. Then, 2 million cubic meters of wood will be saved for mining 100 million tons of coal. Although the initial investment in reinforced concrete supports is greater than that of wooden supports, they can be used for 15 years, while wooden supports can only be used for one and a half years.

    Third, fully utilizing our country's rich asbestos resources and vigorously developing the asbestos cement products industry can also save steel and wood, improve construction quality, and reduce project costs. To illustrate this point, let's compare several commonly used roofing materials. The durable life of thin iron tiles for roofing is 20 to 30 years, but they must be painted every two or three years for maintenance. The service life of asbestos tiles is generally 50 years, and they do not need to be painted. In terms of cost, the price of asbestos tiles is about 70% lower than that of thin iron tiles. One hundred and forty tons of corrugated iron can be saved for every 20,000 square meters of houses, saving an investment of 40,000 yuan. Comparing asbestos tiles with clay tiles, in terms of cost, the cost of clay tiles for each square meter of roofing is 11.45 yuan, while that of asbestos tiles is only 9.84 yuan. The weight of clay tiles per square meter is 70 kilograms, while that of asbestos tiles is only 30 kilograms. Therefore, using clay tiles requires 52 cubic meters of wood per 1,000 square meters, while asbestos tiles only require 25 cubic meters, and the construction period can be shortened by 68%. Asbestos cement pipes can not only supply the construction of chemical industry, textile industry, papermaking and sugar industry, but also be widely used in general industrial construction. For example, if we build an asbestos cement pipe factory with a daily output of 2,250 meters of standard pipes, and use the cement pipes produced every year to replace metal pipes, we can save 42,500 tons of metal materials.

    Fourth, expand the variety of glass to meet the needs of industrial construction and national defense industrial construction. During the second five-year plan period, we will not only expand the production of flat glass to meet the needs of industrial and civil construction, but also learn to produce wired glass, laminated glass, polished glass, glass tubes of various calibers, glass fiber, and insulating materials made of glass fiber to serve the industry; we must learn to manufacture special glass to serve the national defense industry. At the same time, we must try our best to develop various profiles made of glass fiber to replace steel and wood.

    Fifth, give full play to the initiative of local industries and increase new varieties of local building materials. At present, the building materials produced by the industries directly operated by the central government are far from meeting the needs of national economic construction. For several years, small hardware, plumbing equipment, lightweight thermal insulation materials, soft roofing materials, and many other excellent building materials with a long history in our country, especially bricks, tiles, lime, sand, and stone, which are used in the largest quantities, have basically relied on local industries for production and supply. The increase in the variety of local building materials also has a great effect on our country's economic construction. According to the existing varieties of local building materials, it is also possible to increase new varieties. For example, in areas where clay is scarce, silicate bricks should be produced in large quantities. Silicate bricks are simple to manufacture and do not need to be calcined, which can save a lot of coal. In the Soviet Union, the production cost of this kind of brick is about half lower than that of clay bricks. They can be developed in large quantities in places near sand and lime. For example, soft roofing materials, lightweight thermal insulation materials, as well as stone, wood, bamboo, and ceramic industries with excellent traditions have the possibility of increasing varieties and expanding the scope of use. To this end, we suggest that local industrial departments in all provinces and cities, especially in key construction areas, strengthen the leadership of building materials production, establish specialized management agencies, improve the production capacity of existing building materials, improve quality, reduce costs, and, in conjunction with local conditions, study the possibility of developing those economical and beautiful new varieties, and jointly strive to ensure the needs of building materials for the increasingly developing socialist economic construction in our country.

    In order to increase the variety of building materials, in addition to building new factories, existing factories and mines must be technically transformed in a focused manner, and the degree of mechanization must be gradually improved to completely eliminate dust, reduce heavy physical labor, and improve output and quality. It is also necessary to strengthen scientific research and the training of technical cadres. Facts have proved that in the past few years, due to insufficient technical personnel and the failure of scientific research to keep up, the increase in new varieties and the improvement in quality have been greatly limited. To this end, in addition to vigorously organizing existing personnel to advance towards science, we also plan to open several secondary vocational schools and technical schools, and suggest that the Ministry of Higher Education open a building materials college from the second five-year plan to train specialized personnel for the development of the building materials industry in order to meet the requirements of the development of the national basic construction industry.

　　大力增加建筑材料新品种
　　建筑材料工业部部长　赖际发
    在中国共产党第八次全国代表大会上，刘少奇同志和周恩来同志所作的报告里，都明确提出了必须努力生产更多的建筑材料，要加强建筑材料工业的建设的问题。我们将在实际工作中为实现党所交付给我们的光荣任务而努力。
    几年来，建筑材料工业，随着我国规模巨大的基本建设的展开，不论是中央直接经营的或地方经营的，都获得了相应的发展，因而基本上保证了国民经济建设的需要，并为今后进一步发展打下了一定的基础。但是，建筑材料不仅在数量上，而且必须在品种上满足国民经济各部门工程所需各种各样材料的要求，而品种不够却正是建筑材料工业的薄弱环节。目前除水泥、平板玻璃、砖、瓦、灰、砂、石、建筑卫生陶磁和石绵瓦以外，几乎没有其他的新品种出现，就是在现有的几种产品中，种类也是很不全的。例如水泥品种，苏联现有共二十多种，而我们只有十二种。玻璃，苏联现有七十五种，而我们只有四种。石绵水泥管，苏联有二十多种，而我们只有几种。可以大量节省钢材和木材的钢筋混凝土构件，在苏联已经大量采用，而我们只能少量生产。轻量的混凝土砌块、以及硅酸盐砌块等一些新型的建筑材料，我们还不会制造。各种可以使建筑经济美观的材料，也还没有有计划的组织生产。
    这一切都说明了建筑材料工业品种不够是不能适应国民经济建设需要的。除品种以外，建筑材料还存在着质量低、成本高等严重的缺点。这些缺点和落后状况，都必须努力加以克服。因此，我们除了坚决地争取第一个五年计划的完成和超额完成以外，还要积极地为实现第二个五年计划作好准备。
    现在我仅就对增加建筑材料品种方面，提出以下几点意见：
    第一、大力发展水泥工业，积极增加新品种，以保证各种不同工程的需要。目前提倡在各种工程中节约水泥的办法是必要的，但是增加水泥生产和水泥品种，扩大水泥使用范围也是很重要的。我国建筑工程的种类将日益增多，如果在不同的工程上，勉强使用同一品种的水泥，不仅会推迟建设速度、提高工程造价，还会影响工程质量甚至缩短建筑的寿命。例如，必须使用水化热低的大坝水泥，来建筑水利工程的堤坝，才能保证工程质量，如果使用普通水泥，就会发生裂缝，容易损坏。又如用普通水泥制造的混凝土工程，一般要经过二十八天才能达到它应有的强度，显然不能适合紧急工程的要求，如果用高铝水泥，或者快硬水泥，三天就可达到它应有的强度，从而大大加速工程的建设进度。此外，防水工程用的膨涨水泥，防潮防水工程用的不收缩水泥，海水工程用的抗硫酸盐水泥，石油钻井工程用的油井水泥，耐磨损、抗冲击强度高的道路水泥，装饰用的白色水泥，可以节省水泥用量的可塑性水泥等等，都是我们为了满足国民经济建设的需要必须增加的新品种。增加水泥制品，如钢筋混凝土大型砌块、轻量混凝土砌块等材料的生产，是达到基本建设“又多、又快、又好、又省”的重要途径。例如轻量混凝土砌块，每一立方公尺的造价不过十五元左右，而用砖制的砌块，每一立方公尺的造价则需要三十元到三十五元，约贵一倍。而且由于两者的重量不同，同样的距离，轻量混凝土的运费可省五分之三，在施工方面还可以节省一半的建筑工人。特别是地震影响较大的地方，轻量材料更是不可缺少的一种建筑材料。
    第二、在我国钢材不足、木材资源不多的情况下，扩大钢筋混凝土制品品种和使用范围，尽一切可能以钢筋混凝土制品代替钢材和木材是有重要意义的。如铁路、公路桥梁，高压线架线塔，铁路枕木、煤矿坑木等均可以用钢筋混凝土代替。根据计算，钢结构的建筑，如以钢筋混凝土的结构来代替，每十万平方公尺的建筑面积即可节省钢铁八千五百吨。架设一公里的输电线路所用电焊铁塔，需用钢十一点七吨，造价一万零三百元，如果用钢筋混凝土的塔来代替，只用八吨钢，造价八千元，即节省三点七吨钢，造价降低近四分之一。新建一万公里铁路，全部用钢筋混凝土轨枕，就可以节省木材三百万立方公尺，一根钢筋混凝土轨枕只用十六元九角四分，而使用年限可达四十年，每年平均使用费只要四角二分，而一根枕木价格虽然只要十元，可是只能使用五年，每年平均使用费却需要两元。又如煤矿所需要的坑木支架，如果用钢筋混凝土代替，开采一百吨煤即可节省木材二立方公尺，那么，开采一亿吨煤就要节省木材二百万立方公尺。钢筋混凝土支架虽然最初用的投资比木头支架大一些，但可使用十五年，而木头支架只能使用一年半。
    第三、充分利用我国石绵的丰富资源，大量发展石绵水泥制品工业，也可以节省钢材和木材，提高建筑质量，降低工程造价。为了说明这个问题，现在举出普通使用的几种屋顶材料作个比较。用薄铁瓦作屋顶，其耐久年限为二十年到三十年，但每隔两三年就必须刷一次油加以维护。石绵瓦的使用年限一般为五十年，而且不需要刷油。从造价来看，石绵瓦比薄铁瓦的价格约低70％，每二万平方公尺房屋可节省瓦垅铁一百四十吨，节约投资四万元。石绵瓦跟粘土瓦作比较，从造价来看，每一平方公尺屋面用的粘土瓦，其造价为十一元四角五分，而石绵瓦的只有九元八角四分。粘土瓦每平方公尺重量为七十公斤，石绵瓦只有三十公斤，因此，用粘土瓦，每一千平方公尺需要木材五十二立方公尺，而石绵瓦只需要二十五立方公尺，工期尚可缩短百分之六十八。石绵水泥管，不仅可以供应化学工业、纺织工业、造纸和制糖工业建设之用，而且一般工业建设均可大量采用。例如，如果我们建设一个日产标准管二千二百五十公尺长的石绵水泥管工厂，每年所生产的水泥管来代替金属管，则可节省金属材料四万二千五百吨。
    第四、扩大玻璃品种，满足工业建设需要和国防工业建设需要。在第二个五年计划期内，我们不但要扩大平板玻璃的生产，以满足工业和民用建筑的需要，而且要学会生产夹丝玻璃、夹层玻璃、磨光玻璃、各种口径的玻璃管材、玻璃纤维、玻璃纤维制的绝缘材料等来为工业服务；要学会制造特殊玻璃来为国防工业服务。同时还要尽量发展玻璃纤维制造的各种型材，以代替钢材和木材。
    第五、充分发挥地方工业的积极性，增加地方建筑材料的新品种。现在中央直接经营的工业所生产的建筑材料是远远不能满足国家经济建设需要的。几年以来，建筑方面使用的小五金、水暖器材、轻量保温材料、软质屋顶材料以及我国历史悠久的其他许多优良建筑材料，特别是用量最大的砖、瓦、灰、砂、石等基本上都是依靠地方工业来生产和供应的。地方建筑材料品种的增加，对我国经济建设的作用也是很大的。按地方现有的建筑材料品种来说，增加新品种也是可能的。例如，在粘土缺乏的地方，应大量生产硅酸盐砖，硅酸盐砖制造方法简单，又不需要煅烧，可以大量节省煤炭。在苏联，这种砖生产成本比粘土砖约低一半左右。在近砂子、有烧石灰的地方，都可大量发展。又如软质屋顶材料、轻量保温材料，以及具有优良传统的石材、木材、竹材、陶磁等工业都有增加品种、扩大使用范围的可能，为此我们建议各省市，特别是重点建设地区的地方工业部门，加强对建筑材料生产工作的领导，建立专门的管理机构，提高现有建筑材料的生产能力，改善质量，降低成本，并结合本地情况，研究尽可能发展那些经济美观的新品种，共同为保证我国社会主义经济建设事业日益发展的建筑材料需要而努力。
    为了增加建筑材料品种，除了增建新厂，还要对现有的工厂、矿山有重点地进行技术改造，逐步提高机械化程度，以彻底消灭粉尘，减轻笨重体力劳动，提高产量和质量。还必须加强科学研究工作和技术干部的培养工作。事实证明，已往几年来，由于技术人材不足，科学研究工作跟不上去，新品种的增加，质量的提高，都受到很大的限制。为此，我们除了大力组织现有人员向科学进军外，还准备开办几个中等专业学校和技工学校，并建议高等教育部从第二个五年计划开始，开办一个建筑材料专科大学，为建筑材料工业的发展培养专门人材，以适应国家基本建设事业发展的要求。
