Xinhua News Agency report: Heilongjiang Province is universally launching a feed storage campaign to actively prepare winter feed for livestock.

Heilongjiang Province had a lot of rain this year, and some grasslands were flooded, resulting in poor growth of grain grass, and insufficient winter feed for livestock in some areas. In order to ensure that livestock have sufficient fodder in winter and to prevent them from continuing to lose weight, many agricultural cooperatives in Qinggang, Acheng, and other counties have organized special production teams to collect grass seeds, harvest sheep grass, and ensile feed. Longjiang County has ensiled five hundred pits of feed in the last three days alone. According to statistics from Nenjiang, Suihua, Mudanjiang, and other regions, 500 million jin of highland barley can be stored this autumn.

　　黑龙江贮备牲畜过冬饲料
    据新华社讯　黑龙江省农村普遍开展贮备饲料运动，积极为牲畜准备过冬饲料。
    黑龙江省今年雨水多，有些草原被淹，谷草生长不良，有些地区牲口越冬饲料不足。为使牲畜在冬季有足够的草料，防止牲畜继续瘦弱，青岗、阿城等县许多农业社都组织了专门生产队、进行撸草籽、打羊草和青贮饲料的工作。龙江县在最近三天内就青贮了五百窖饲料。根据嫩江、绥化、牡丹江等专区的统计，今秋可以贮备五亿斤青稞。
