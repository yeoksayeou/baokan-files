Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 4th -- Indonesian political leaders have rebuked the Netherlands for protesting to the United Nations about Indonesia's abolition of its debt to the Netherlands.

    Finance Minister Wibisono refuted on the 3rd the Dutch insistence that Indonesia's abolition of its debt to the Netherlands was a violation of international agreements. He emphasized that the Netherlands, having refused to return West Irian to Indonesia one year after the transfer of sovereignty, was the first to violate the agreement.
    Former Education Minister and current Member of Parliament, Muhammad Yamin, told "Indonesia Torch" that the debts were imposed on Indonesia by the Netherlands based on the Round Table Conference agreement, which has already been abolished by Indonesia. These debts were the funds used by the Dutch colonial government to carry out aggressive wars against the Indonesian people. Yamin pointed out that the only way for the Dutch government to improve its relations with Indonesia is to conduct direct negotiations with Indonesia to resolve various difficult issues and stop the colonial rule of West Irian.
    Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mononutu said in a conversation that he hoped the United Nations would be able to recognize that the "crux of the problem lies in whether or not to recognize Dutch colonialism as something politically legitimate."
    The Indonesian government has announced that it is no longer obligated to pay the debts to the Netherlands mentioned in the Round Table Conference agreement, which is a step towards realizing the abolition of the Round Table Conference agreement.
    Speaking of Indonesia's unilateral abolition of the Round Table Conference agreement, he said: The United Nations should not ignore the fact that the first to take unilateral action was the Netherlands,
    "Although according to the Round Table Conference agreement, the West Irian region is a disputed territory, it placed this region within its sovereignty without prior consultation with Indonesia."

### 印度尼西亚政界说废除对荷债务有充分理由  指出荷兰拒绝交还西伊里安首先破坏协定

    印度尼西亚政界说废除对荷债务有充分理由
    指出荷兰拒绝交还西伊里安首先破坏协定
    据新华社雅加达4日电　印度尼西亚的政界领袖们斥责荷兰向联合国抗议印度尼西亚废除它对荷兰的债务。
    财政部长维比索诺3日驳斥了荷兰硬说印度尼西亚废除它对荷兰的债务因而违反国际协定的指责。他并且着重指出，荷兰在移交主权一年以后还拒绝把西伊里安交还印度尼西亚，因而违反协定的首先是荷兰自己。
    前教育部长、现任国会议员穆罕默德·雅明对“印度尼西亚火炬报”说，那些债务是荷兰根据已经由印度尼西亚废除的圆桌会议协定强加在印度尼西亚身上的。那些债务是荷兰殖民政府用来对印度尼西亚人民进行侵略战争的经费。雅明指出，荷兰政府改善它同印度尼西亚关系的唯一办法，就是同印度尼西亚进行直接谈判解决各个困难问题和停止对西伊里安的殖民统治。
    印度尼西亚外交部发言人莫诺努图在谈话中表示，希望联合国能够认识到问题的“症结在于是否承认荷兰殖民主义是政治上正当的东西”。
    印度尼西亚政府已经宣布了它再也没有义务偿付圆桌会议协定中所提到的对荷兰的债务，这是实现废除圆桌会议协定的一个步骤。
    在谈到印度尼西亚单方面废除圆桌会议协定这件事情的时候，他说：联合国不应该忽视这样一个事实：首先采取片面行动的是荷兰，
  “尽管根据圆桌会议协定，西伊里安地区是有争执的领土，但是它却不事先同印度尼西亚协商就把这个地区置于它的主权范围以内”。
