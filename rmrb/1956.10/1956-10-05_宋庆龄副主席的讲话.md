    Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling's Speech
    Your Excellency President Sukarno, Ladies and Gentlemen:
    We have just heard President Sukarno's speech. This is the resounding voice of the independent Indonesian people. After listening to President Sukarno's speech, we have a further understanding of the aspirations of the Indonesian people. The Chinese people, who suffered the same hardships as the Indonesian people in the past and now share the same ideals as the Indonesian people, fully sympathize with and fully support the Indonesian people's struggle to safeguard national independence, strengthen domestic unity, build their own country, and strive for world peace.
    We thank President Sukarno for the friendship he expressed on behalf of the Indonesian people to the Chinese people. The Chinese people will do everything in their power to maintain and strengthen this precious friendship. The friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people has a long tradition, a solid foundation, and is unbreakable.
    Finally, let us deeply thank President Sukarno for his kind speech to us at this meeting today.
