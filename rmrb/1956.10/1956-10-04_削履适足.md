    Cutting the Shoe to Fit the Foot
    Farmers in Sichuan Province are very fond of wearing rubber shoes, and the sales volume of rubber shoes in rural areas is increasing. Although there are two rubber factories in Chongqing that produce rubber shoes, they still cannot meet the demand. Therefore, the commercial departments have transferred a considerable number of rubber shoes from Shanghai, Tianjin and other places to supply the market. The quantity was enough, but the rubber shoes transferred in were small in size and had pointed toes, which made the farmers feel uncomfortable. They said: "These are for city people to wear. We farmers have big feet and can't stand this delicate torture." As a result, rubber shoes were both out of stock and overstocked in the market.
    In order to find a way out for the tens of thousands of pairs of overstocked rubber shoes, the Sichuan Provincial Department Store came up with a method to cut off the pointed toes of the rubber shoes and replace them with large round toes. "Cutting the foot to fit the shoe" is certainly wrong, but is a measure like "cutting the shoe to fit the foot" by the Sichuan Department Store necessarily right? Because doing so will also cause great losses.

    削履适足
    四川省农民很喜欢穿胶鞋，胶鞋在农村的销售量越来越大。重庆市虽然有两个橡胶厂生产胶鞋，但仍然不能满足需要。于是，商业部门便从上海、天津等地调进相当数量的胶鞋来供应市场。数量是凑够了，可是调进来的胶鞋尺寸小、鞋头太尖，农民们穿着很难受。他们说：“这是城里人穿的，我们这些庄稼汉脚粗大，受不了这种秀气罪”。于是，胶鞋在市场上一边脱销，一边积压。
    为了给积压着的几万双胶鞋找出路，四川省百货公司就想出了一个办法，准备把胶鞋的尖头削去，再补上一个大圆头。“削足适履”固然错误，而像四川百货公司这样的“削履适足”的措施也未必对吧？因为这样做的结果，也会造成很大的损失。
