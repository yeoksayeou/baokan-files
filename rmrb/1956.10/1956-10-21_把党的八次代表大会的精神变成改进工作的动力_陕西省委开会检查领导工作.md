    Turning the Spirit of the Party's Eighth National Congress into a Driving Force for Improving Work
    Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee Holds Meeting to Review Leadership Work

    (Our Dispatch) The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an enlarged meeting from October 11th to 14th. This meeting embodied the spirit of the Party's Eighth National Congress.
    The meeting listened to Comrade Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, conveying the spirit of the Party's Eighth National Congress. This conveyance was closely linked to the practical problems in Shaanxi Province's work. Comrade Zhang Desheng pointed out that Shaanxi Province's work had achieved great successes this year, but there were also many problems. The party organizations in Shaanxi Province must unite the people of the province to consolidate the achievements already made, examine and correct the shortcomings in their work, and implement the spirit of the Party's Eighth National Congress.
    The leading comrades of the provincial departments who attended the meeting then launched discussions on the problems existing in Shaanxi Province's industry, agriculture, finance, and economics, with a spirit of criticism and self-criticism. In the industrial field, there was serious bureaucracy, which affected the development of industrial construction. For example, due to the disconnection between municipal construction and industrial construction in the new industrial zones, work such as material supply, roads, and service industries could not keep up, and even the planning of some new industrial cities has not been finalized to this day. This has brought many new difficulties to industrial construction and seriously affected the development of industrial construction. When discussing the leadership of agricultural production, the comrades attending the meeting used many typical examples to illustrate the subjective work style of the leadership in agricultural production. For example, the farmers on the plateau of Liquan County have been planting millet for many years, which is a high-yield crop in the plateau area. However, after the staff of our agricultural departments looked up in the books that millet is a low-yield crop, they insisted that the local farmers change to planting corn, which resulted in losses in agricultural production on the plateau. Another example is the issue of reduced wheat production this year. One of the main reasons is that the leadership's understanding of the laws of wheat maturity this year was unclear. This year, due to the agricultural cooperatives carrying out careful management work such as weeding, spring irrigation, and topdressing on wheat fields, coupled with sufficient and timely spring rain, the wheat grew vigorously and matured earlier. The leadership did not grasp this new change sufficiently, and some people believed that the wheat was still growing. Therefore, the harvesting was not timely, and encountering rain and flooding disasters resulted in a reduction of more than 300 million jin in wheat production this year. There were also subjective problems in expanding the area of double-cropping and other issues.
    At this meeting, a new atmosphere rarely seen in previous provincial committee meetings emerged. The comrades attending the meeting boldly put forward their own opinions, opposing what they opposed and agreeing with what they agreed with, with a very clear attitude.
    The comrades attending the enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee unanimously believed that the Party's Eighth National Congress put forward many new issues, but because the meeting was short, the understanding of the spirit of the congress was not deep enough. Therefore, in the future, they will continue to study the documents of the congress in conjunction with the problems in their actual work, and turn the spirit of the Party's Eighth National Congress into a driving force for improving work.

    把党的八次代表大会的精神变成改进工作的动力
    陕西省委开会检查领导工作
    本报讯　中共陕西省委会于10月11日到14日举行了扩大会议。这次会议体现了党的八次代表大会的精神。
    会议听取了省委第一书记张德生同志关于党的八次代表大会精神的传达，这个传达紧紧地结合着陕西省实际工作中的问题。张德生同志指出，今年，陕西省的工作已获得很大的成绩，但是也有不少的问题。陕西省的党组织必须团结全省人民巩固已取得的成绩，检查和纠正工作中的缺点，来贯彻党的八次代表大会的精神。
    出席会议的省级各部门领导同志，随即以批评和自我批评的精神，就陕西省的工业、农业、财经等方面存在的问题，展开了讨论。在工业方面存在着严重的官僚主义，影响着工业建设的发展。例如由于新工业区的市政建设和工业建设脱节，物资供应、道路以及服务业等工作都赶不上去，甚至有的新的工业城市的规划直到今天还没有定下来，这给工业建设带来很多新的困难，严重地影响了工业建设的发展。在讨论农业生产的领导问题时，到会的同志以很多典型的事例来说明农业生产领导中的主观主义的思想作风。例如在醴泉县高原上的农民，多少年来都是种谷子，这是高原地带的高产作物，但是，我们的农业部门的工作人员从书本上查出谷子是低产作物之后，就坚持要当地农民改种玉米，结果使高原上的农业生产受了损失。又如今年小麦减产问题，其主要原因之一是领导上对今年小麦成熟的规律认识不清，今年小麦由于农业社对麦田普遍地进行了锄草、春灌、追肥等细致的管理工作，再加上春雨充足适时，因而生长旺盛，麦子成熟较早。领导上对这种新的变化掌握不够，有些人认为小麦还在生长，因此，收割不及时，而碰上雨涝的灾害，使今年的小麦减产三亿余斤。其它在扩大复种面积等问题上，也都存在着主观主义的毛病。
    在这次会议上，出现了以往省委会少有的新气象，出席会议的同志，都大胆地提出了自己的意见，反对就是反对，赞成就是赞成，态度非常明确。
    出席省委扩大会议的同志，一致认为党的八次代表大会提出了很多新的问题，但是，因为这次会议时间短，对大会的精神体会得还很不深刻。因此，今后将继续结合实际工作中的问题，学习大会的文件，把党的八次代表大会的精神变成改进工作的动力。
