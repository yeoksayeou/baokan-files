Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, 24th (TASS): "Worker's Voice" published the draft resolution of the Central Committee of the Brazilian Communist Party: "On the Lessons of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences, and the Tasks of the Brazilian Communist Party."

The draft resolution analyzes the changes in the international situation and points out that the Soviet people have made great achievements in the cause of building communism. The draft states that socialism has become a world system. At the same time, the colonial system is rapidly collapsing.

The people of underdeveloped countries dedicated to progress and the development of an independent economy are increasingly clear that the existence of the world socialist system is of great significance for the realization of their goals.

The draft resolution points out the more important economic and social changes in Brazil, which are conducive to the political forces defending national independence. A union of patriotic and democratic forces has been formed, and they have recently achieved some success. The draft says, however, "The forces in Brazil yearning for democracy and progress have not been able to stop actions against the democratic patriotic movement, nor have they been able to bring about democratic and progressive changes in the country's foreign and domestic policies."

The document points out that under current conditions, the direction of the activities of the Communists should be to unite all patriots and democrats under the following general goals: to defend national independence, peaceful foreign policy, free trade, friendly relations with all countries in the world, to protect national resources and independently develop Brazil's economy, to safeguard democratic freedoms and abolish all forms of ideological and political discrimination in the country, to improve the living standards of the working people, to take measures to curb high prices and inflation, and to carry out land reform.

The Central Committee said that every Communist Party member should carefully study Brazil's path to broad democratization, national liberation, and socialism based on the original experience of struggle and the results of research on today's changes in Brazil and the world.

The draft resolution points out that the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union emphasized the Leninist principle of collective leadership. The Central Committee supports the measures taken by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the issue of collective leadership and calls on Communist Party members to study this issue.

The draft resolution analyzes the mistakes made by the Brazilian Communist Party in the area of the cult of personality and points out that these errors suppressed the initiative of Communist Party members and the masses, hindered the creative development of revolutionary theory and practice, and created difficulties for criticism and self-criticism and collective leadership.

The draft resolution points out that it is necessary to intensify the struggle against ideological tendencies harmful to the proletariat within the party ranks.

The draft resolution concludes by saying that the Central Committee is launching a discussion on the issues raised in the draft resolution. This discussion will promote the consolidation and unity of the party. After the discussion, the Central Committee will make a decision on the issues discussed.

    巴西共产党中央发表决议草案
    指出党当前的活动方向是尽力团结一切爱国者和民主人士为保卫独立，争取民主、进步与和平而斗争
    新华社25日讯　塔斯社蒙得维的亚24日讯：“工人呼声报”发表了巴西共产党中央委员会的决议草案：“关于苏联共产党二十次代表大会的经验教训、个人崇拜及其后果以及巴西共产党的任务”。
    决议草案里分析了国际局势的变化，并且指出，苏联人民在建设共产主义的事业中取得了巨大的成就。草案中写道，社会主义已经变为世界体系了。与此同时，殖民主义制度却在迅速崩溃中。
    致力于进步和发展独立经济的不发达国家的人民日益清楚地看出，世界社会主义体系的存在对于他们的目标的实现，具有重大的意义。
    决议草案指出了巴西经济和社会方面比较重要的变化，这些变化有利于保卫国家民族独立的政治力量。爱国主义和民主力量形成了一个联盟，它们在最近取得了某些成就。草案说，但是，“巴西渴望民主和进步的力量还没有能够阻止反对民主爱国运动的行动，没有能够使国家的外交政策和国内政策发生民主性和进步性的变化。”
    这个文件指出，在当前的条件下，共产党人活动的方向应当是把一切爱国者和民主人士团结在下列总的目标之下：保卫民族独立、和平外交政策、自由贸易、和世界各国友好相处、保护国家资源和独立发展巴西的经济、维护民主自由和废除国内一切形式的思想歧视和政治歧视、提高劳动人民生活水平、采取措施制止物价昂贵和通货膨胀、进行土地改革。
    中央委员会说，每一个共产党员都应该根据原有的斗争经验，根据对巴西和全世界今天的变化进行研究的结果，细心地研究巴西走向广泛民主化、民族解放和社会主义的道路。
    决议草案指出，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会强调指出了列宁主义的集体领导原则。中央委员会拥护苏联共产党就党的集体领导问题所采取的各项措施，并号召共产党员们研究这一问题。
    决议草案分析了巴西共产党在个人崇拜方面所犯的错误，并且指出，这些错误抑制了共产党员和群众发挥主动精神，妨碍了革命理论和实践的创造性发展，给批评与自我批评和集体领导造成了困难。
    决议草案指出，必须在党的队伍中加紧对有害于无产阶级的思想倾向进行斗争。
    决议草案在最后说，中央委员会正在就决议草案中所提出的问题展开讨论。这一讨论将促进党的巩固与团结。在讨论之后，中央委员会将就讨论的问题作出决议。
