Xinhua News Agency, 20th – According to preliminary statistics from the Ministry of Forestry, approximately 11,900 townships (villages) in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas across the country have formulated production plans for developing diverse economies in mountainous regions.

These townships’ (villages’) production plans were formulated under the leadership of the local Mountainous Area Production Planning Committee Offices, based on varying natural conditions and the sideline production of farmers.

Past experience in areas that have undergone planning has proven that not only is land rationally utilized and production developed, but the lives of people in mountainous areas have also been improved. For example, after planning in Yangjingdi Township, Ping順 County, Shanxi Province, barren mountains and bald ridges have been completely greened. Steep slopes have been transformed into terraced fields and orchards. Over the past few years, 180,000 catties of fruit have been harvested. The township actively engages in closing hillsides for afforestation, cultivating pasture, repairing valley dikes, and diverting flood irrigation, resulting in significant development in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. Last year, the total income from various productions in this township reached over 76,000 yuan, with an average cash income of over 50 yuan per person in the township, excluding food rations. Dongye Township in Lin County, Henan, which was also a poor mountainous area in the past, has gradually changed its impoverished state after implementing production planning. Of the township's 12,000 mu of barren land, 7,000 mu have been transformed into orchards, with the rest used as pasture. Currently, the planted fruit trees have begun to bear fruit, and it is expected that by 1962, 3 million catties of mountain products and 500 tons of timber can be exported annually. However, some areas, due to simply focusing on developing agricultural production and not developing diverse economies based on the characteristics of mountainous areas, blindly expand cultivated land by reclaiming steep slopes, resulting in severe soil erosion, destroying existing farmland, and greatly reducing farmers' income.

Mountainous and semi-mountainous counties account for approximately 60% of the total number of counties in the country, and the mountainous population accounts for approximately 40% of the total agricultural population in the country. Therefore, strengthening leadership over production planning in mountainous areas and developing diverse operations such as agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in a planned manner in mountainous areas is of great significance.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 20th – Shanxi Province's autumn soil and water conservation campaign has already started in mid-October, beginning in the northern region.

The Yanbei region on the Loess Plateau started the earliest. This region will organize 400,000 farmers in October and November to participate in basic construction projects such as afforestation, water conservancy, and soil and water conservation, and will send more than 3,000 cadres to go deep into the sites to provide guidance. Changzhi, Jinnan, and Yuci regions are currently training cadres, planning labor, and intensifying various preparatory work.

Shanxi Province plans to conserve 22.5 million mu of soil and water this year, but by September, the province had only completed half of the task. In order to strive to complete all soil and water conservation tasks, the Shanxi Provincial Soil and Water Conservation Bureau is intensifying its efforts to promote this work, requiring all localities to implement the principle of focusing on comprehensive management to truly achieve the goal of controlling soil erosion and fully utilizing land resources within a watershed.

### 一万多个乡制定了发展山区的生产规划  山西省加紧进行秋季水土保持工作

    一万多个乡制定了发展山区的生产规划
    山西省加紧进行秋季水土保持工作
    新华社20日讯　据林业部的初步统计，全国约有一万一千九百个山区半山区的乡（村），已经制定了发展山区多种经济的生产规划。
    这些乡（村）的生产规划是在各地的山区生产规划委员会办公室领导下，根据不同的自然条件和农民的副业生产情况制定的。
    凡是经过规划的山区，过去的经验都证明，不仅土地得到了合理利用，发展了生产，并且山区人民的生活也都得到了改善。如山西省平顺县羊井底乡经过规划后，荒山秃岭已经全部绿化。陡坡都变成了梯田和果园。几年来，水果收获了十八万斤。全乡积极进行封山育林、培育牧草，整修谷坊和引洪灌溉的结果，农、林、牧业都得到了很大发展。去年这个乡各种生产的总收入达到七万六千多元，全乡平均每人除去吃粮外，还有五十多元现款收入。河南林县东冶乡过去也是个穷山区，进行生产规划后，也逐步改变了贫困面貌。全乡一万二千亩秃地，已有七千亩变成了果林，其余做为牧地。现在，栽植的果树已开始结果，预计到1962年每年可输出三百万斤山货，五百吨木材。可是有些地区由于单纯注意发展农业生产，不根据山区特点来发展多种经济，盲目地从开垦陡坡来扩大耕地，因而造成严重的水土流失，使原有的农田遭到破坏，农民收入也大大减少。
    我国山区、半山区的县份约占全国县份总数的60％左右，山区人口约占全国农业人口总数的40％左右。因此，加强对山区生产规划的领导，有计划地来发展山区农、林、牧业等多种经营，有着重大意义。
    新华社太原20日电　山西省秋季水土保持运动，已经在10月中旬从北部开始。
    黄土高原上的雁北地区开始最早。这个地区要在10月和11月组织四十万农民参加造林、水利和水土保持等基本建设工程，并派三千多干部深入现场指导。长治、晋南和榆次地区目前正训练干部，规划劳力，加紧进行各项准备工作。
    山西省今年计划水土保持二千二百五十万亩，但到9月份止，全省只完成任务的一半。为了争取全部完成水土保持任务，山西省水土保持工作局正在加紧推动这一工作，要求各地贯彻重点全面治理的方针，真正达到在一个流域内控制水土流失和充分利用土地资源的目的。
