Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 26th – Seventeen new post and telecommunications bureaus and stations are being established in remote areas of Tibet such as Lhoyu, Ngari, and the northern Tibetan grasslands.

Prior to this, more than thirty post and telecommunications bureaus and stations had already been established throughout Tibet, along with more than a dozen mobile radio stations dedicated to serving geology, hydrology, and engineering departments. The establishment of these postal and telecommunications institutions has facilitated communication between the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet and offices at all levels, and has also strengthened the connection between Tibet and major cities in the interior. In the third quarter of this year, the number of telegrams sent from the Lhasa Post and Telecommunications Bureau to various locations increased by 100% compared to the spring.

The postal routes within Tibet have been extended from more than 4,000 kilometers last year to 8,000 kilometers, and the Qinghai-Tibet Highway postal route was also opened not long ago. Letters from Beijing can reach Lhasa in about twenty days. The circulation of mainland newspapers and periodicals in Tibet has greatly increased, now reaching more than 400 types, with an average circulation of over 700,000 copies per quarter.

The Tibet Post and Telecommunications Administration is studying further expansion and improvement of postal and telecommunications services. The feasibility study for the Lhasa-Shigatse-Gyangtse wired telegraph and telephone line was completed at the end of September. The postal and telecommunications departments are also collecting materials to study sending and receiving telegrams in the Tibetan language.

    西藏境内邮程已达八千公里
    新华社拉萨26日电　西藏边远的珞瑜、阿里和藏北草原等地区，正在设立十七个邮电局、所。
    在这以前，西藏全区已经建立了三十多个邮电局、所，还有十几部流动电台专为地质、水文和工程等部门服务。这些邮电机构的建立，便利了自治区筹备委员会和各级办事处的联系，西藏和内地各大城市的联系也更加密切了。今年第三季度，拉萨邮电局拍发往各地的电报就比春季增加了一倍。
    西藏境内的邮程已从去年的四千多公里延长到八千公里，不久前还开辟了青藏公路的邮路。从北京寄来的信件二十天左右可到达拉萨。内地报刊在西藏的发行量大大增加了，现在已达到四百多种，每季度的平均发行量在七十万份以上。
    西藏邮电管理局正在研究进一步扩大和改进邮电业务。拉萨——日喀则——江孜间的有线电报电话线路，已在9月底勘测完毕。邮电部门还在搜集材料，研究用藏文拍发电报。
