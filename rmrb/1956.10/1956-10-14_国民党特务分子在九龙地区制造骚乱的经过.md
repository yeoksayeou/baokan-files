Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th: Our correspondent reports on the course of the major disturbances in the Kowloon area: The major disturbances in the Kowloon area have continued for four days. Today, the clouds of terror and unease still hang over Kowloon and Hong Kong. The disturbances have not subsided.

The Kuomintang secret agents deliberately created this shocking disturbance. The matter began at 11:30 a.m. on October 10th, when a junior official of the Hong Kong British authorities tore down a Kuomintang flag from a wall where the posting of slogans was prohibited. This caused a riot by secret agents, which was quickly quelled by the Hong Kong British authorities. Taking advantage of the chaotic situation created by this incident, Kuomintang secret agents, on the same afternoon, gathered a large number of hooligans, bad elements, landlords and bullies who had fled from the mainland, as well as people who were instigated by the secret agents and followed suit, and began a large-scale, organized and planned riot.

The riot activities first started in the "resettlement areas" in the northern part of the Kowloon urban area, where the fleeing landlords and bullies were settled, and then quickly spread to the northwestern and southern central areas of the urban area. In order to instigate the masses to participate in the riot and further expand the situation, the secret agents guided various lawless elements to plunder many shops, enterprises, households and passing pedestrians on the night of the 10th. The rioters looted property, and some lawless elements took advantage of the chaos to rob.

From the afternoon of the 10th to the evening of the 11th, the Hong Kong British authorities did not take effective measures to stop the riot. As a result, the riot area became larger and larger, and the secret agents and rioters became extremely arrogant. It was not until the riot spread to the entire Kowloon urban area that the British authorities deployed troops equipped with tanks and armored vehicles on the evening of the 11th and declared martial law in the Kowloon area. But the situation had developed to an extremely serious point. The Tsuen Wan industrial area in the northwestern part of Kowloon was subjected to burning, killing, and looting by rioters twice in a row. Some unarmed workers were beaten to death, and some women were gang-raped and killed on the street. The naked female corpses were lying on the street, a tragic sight too horrible to look at.

The US-Chiang newspapers were pleased with the riots created by the Kuomintang secret agents. The Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan openly exonerated the Kuomintang secret agents, attempting to shift the responsibility to the so-called communists. However, the ironclad facts prove that this large-scale riot was created single-handedly by Kuomintang secret agents. According to eyewitnesses, the only flag flown by the rioters during the large-scale riot was the Kuomintang flag, and the Kuomintang party emblem was the rioters' communication symbol. Even now, Kuomintang secret agents are blatantly wearing Kuomintang badges and are actively moving around, and organized and prepared large bicycle teams and cars, with Kuomintang flags inserted on the vehicles, shuttling back and forth among the rioting crowds to direct them. At the same time, someone witnessed well-dressed ringleaders in neat suits riding in beautiful cars with Kuomintang flags inserted, personally directing the scene. In the resettlement areas where the exiled landlords and bullies live, the secret agents raised the Kuomintang flag. The rioters also forced residents to buy Kuomintang flags at high prices ranging from five to ten yuan; anyone who refused to buy was beaten. It is worth pointing out that many of the targets of the rioters' attacks were properties of the Chinese People's Government in Kowloon (Kwangtung Provincial Bank Kowloon Branch), or native product companies and department stores that deal in mainland products (such as China Construction Company, Guangzhou Company, etc.), or patriotic businesses, schools (such as Heung To Middle School), and labor unions. At the same time, countless industrial and commercial enterprises and ordinary residents also suffered from the burning, killing, and looting by the rioters. All kinds of facts prove that the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan cannot deny the crimes committed by their secret agents.

In the course of the riots, the Hong Kong British authorities adopted an irresponsible attitude, allowing the secret agents and rioters to do whatever they wanted, and attempting to shirk their responsibility to protect the lives and property of the Kowloon compatriots. When the riot activities first occurred in the resettlement area on October 10th, the Hong Kong British authorities quickly protected their own administrative organs; however, when the above-mentioned many enterprises, shops, factories, schools, trade union offices, and general residential houses were attacked by rioters, although the victims repeatedly called the police for help, the Hong Kong British authorities were slow to provide assistance. When Heung To Middle School was attacked by rioters on the night of the 10th, it called the police three or forty times, but the Hong Kong British police authorities said that they could not provide assistance, resulting in serious damage to the school. When the school was attacked again on the 12th, British troops were stationed there, but they withdrew when the rioters arrived, allowing the rioters to set fire to the school's new campus again. In the past two days, the secret agents and rioters have taken advantage of this laissez-faire attitude of the Hong Kong British authorities, and although it is nominally a period of "martial law," they are still acting in small groups, gathering small groups into large groups, and are brewing even larger-scale riots.

It is worth noting what is the purpose of this indulgent attitude of the Hong Kong British authorities towards the secret agent rioters? People believe that the Hong Kong British authorities are not unable to quell this riot, but they have not taken effective measures, and their intentions are suspicious. According to residents who escaped from the Tsuen Wan area of Kowloon, when rioters carried out massacres, arson, and rapes in this area on the nights of the 11th and 12th, the British police there withdrew to the police station, and the British troops did not enter Tsuen Wan until the rioters had finished their killing and arson. As a result, the workers and residents in this area suffered heavy casualties. On the night of the 11th when the riots broke out in Tsuen Wan, the Hong Kong British official spokesman immediately announced after the incident that it was entirely a conflict between two factions of Chinese, and that the police or British troops were not responsible. One cannot help but suspect whether this is a conspiracy by the Hong Kong British authorities to deliberately create a so-called "conflict between two factions of Chinese" in the face of world public opinion?

The Chinese people and the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon are extremely indignant at the atrocities of the Kuomintang secret agents and extremely dissatisfied with the conniving attitude of the Hong Kong British authorities. This intolerable situation must be changed quickly and cannot be allowed to continue for a moment longer.

    国民党特务分子在九龙地区制造骚乱的经过
    新华社广州13日电　本社记者报道九龙地区大骚乱的经过说：九龙地区的大骚乱延续到了第四天。今天恐怖和不安的阴云仍然笼罩着九龙和香港。骚乱并没有平息下来。
    国民党特务分子蓄意制造这次惊人的骚乱事件。事情开始在10月10日上午十一时三十分，一名香港英国当局的下级官员从不准张贴标语的墙上撕下了一面国民党旗帜，当时引起了特务分子的骚乱，事情很快被香港英国当局平息下来。国民党特务分子利用这次事件所造成的混乱情势，在当天下午，纠合大批流氓分子、坏分子、大陆逃亡的地主恶霸分子以及被特务煽动而随势附和的人，开始了有组织有计划地大规模的骚乱。
    骚乱活动首先从九龙市区北部安置逃亡地主恶霸分子的“徙置区”开始，随后很快地向市区的西北部和南部中心区蔓延开来。为了煽动群众参加骚乱，进一步使事态扩大，特务分子引导各种不法分子于10日夜抢掠了许多商店、企业、住户和来往行人。暴徒们掳掠了财物，一些不法分子也趁火打劫。
    从10日下午到11日傍晚，香港英国当局没有采取有效的措施来制止骚乱。这样，骚乱地区越来越扩大，特务和暴徒们气焰极盛。直到骚乱蔓延到整个九龙市区之后，英国当局才在11日晚间，调来了配备有坦克和装甲车的部队，并宣布九龙地区立施戒严。但事态已发展到极其严重的地步。九龙市区西北部的荃湾工业区连续两次遭到暴徒的烧杀、抢掠，一些手无寸铁的工人被活活打死，有的妇女在街上便被暴徒轮奸后杀死，裸体女尸横陈街上，惨状不忍目睹。
    美蒋报纸对国民党特务制造的骚乱感到高兴。台湾蒋介石集团公开替国民党特务分子开脱罪责，企图把责任转嫁到所谓共产党人的身上。但是铁一般的事实证明这次大规模的骚乱是国民党特务分子一手造成的。据目击者说，在大规模的骚乱过程中，暴徒们打着的唯一的旗帜是国民党的旗帜，国民党党徽是暴徒们的联络符号。直到现在，国民党特务分子还明目张胆地挂着国民党徽章四出活动，并有组织有准备地出动大批自行车队和汽车，车辆上插着国民党旗帜，在骚乱的人群中往来指挥。同时有人目击，身着笔挺西装的头目乘着插有国民党旗帜的漂亮汽车，亲临现场指挥。在流亡的地主恶霸住居的徙置区，特务们升起了国民党旗。暴徒们还强迫居民出五元、十元不等的高价购买国民党旗帜；凡是不愿购买的人都被殴打。值得指出的是：暴徒们袭击的目标中有许多是属于中国人民政府在九龙的产业（广东省银行九龙分行），或者是经营大陆产品的土产公司和百货公司（如中建公司、广州公司等），或者是爱国的商号、学校（如香岛中学）和工会。而无数的工商企业和普通居民也同时遭受暴徒的烧杀、抢掠，种种事实证明：台湾蒋介石集团对他们的特务分子所造成的罪行是无法抵赖的。
    在骚乱过程中，香港英国当局采取了不负责任的态度，听任特务和暴徒们为所欲为，而且企图推脱保护九龙同胞生命财产安全的责任。10月10日骚乱活动在徙置区刚一发生的时候，香港英国当局就对自己的行政机关迅速加以保护；但是，在上述的许多企业、商店、工厂、学校、工会会所以及一般居民住宅遭受暴徒袭击的时候，虽然受袭击者一再报警求援，香港英国当局却迟迟不予援救。香岛中学在10日夜遭受暴徒袭击的时候，曾打了三、四十次电话报警，香港英国警察当局竟说无法援救，以致这个学校遭到严重的破坏。当这个学校在12日又一次遭受袭击时，那里原驻有英军，但他们在暴徒到达时就撤走了，听任暴徒再度纵火焚毁该校的新校舍。这两天来，特务和暴徒们利用香港英国当局这种放任态度，虽在名义上是“戒严”时期；仍然化整为零，聚零为整地四出活动，并且正在酝酿着更大规模的骚动。
    值得注意的是，香港英国当局这种对待特务暴徒的放纵态度究竟是为了什么？人们相信，香港英国当局不是无力扑灭这次骚乱的，但它竟然没有采取有效的措施，其意图是值得怀疑的。据自九龙荃湾地区逃难出来的居民说，11日和12日两夜暴徒在这个地区进行杀人、纵火、强奸的大暴行时，那里的英国警察就撤回警署，而英国军队则迟迟在暴徒们干完了杀人放火的勾当之后才开入荃湾。结果造成这个地区工人和居民的重大死伤。在11日荃湾发生暴乱的当晚，香港英国官方发言人在事情发生后立即宣布说：这完全是两派华人的冲突，警察或英军都没有责任。人们不能不怀疑，这是否就是香港英国当局在世界舆论面前有意制造所谓“两派华人冲突”的阴谋呢？
    中国人民以及港九同胞对国民党特务分子的暴行极为愤慨，对香港英国当局的纵容态度极表不满。这种不能容忍的情况必须迅速改变，一刻也不能再继续下去。
