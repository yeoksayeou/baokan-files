　　Xuzhou Factories Achieve Results in Saving Raw Materials

　　(Our report) To overcome difficulties in raw material supply, local factories in Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, have actively researched and used substitutes. For example, the Da Yong Hardware Factory used to manufacture adjustable wrenches entirely from stainless steel and other metal materials. After successfully experimenting with using scrap artillery shells to replace all stainless steel in the manufacture of adjustable wrenches in April of this year, they immediately began purchasing large quantities of scrap artillery shells for production. This saves approximately 3,000 jin of stainless steel per month. Because scrap artillery shells are cheaper than stainless steel, the cost has been reduced by more than 30%, and the product quality has also improved. The toughness of the wrenches has greatly increased, basically eliminating the problem of wrench breakage that occurred in the past. The factory also used substitutes for most of the copper material used to manufacture pin tumbler locks. Other hardware and machinery factories, such as the Xuzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory, Meifeng Iron Factory, Xuzhou Boiler Factory, and Xuzhou Farm Implement Factory, have also made considerable achievements in using substitutes and saving high-quality steel and other metal materials. The Meifeng Iron Factory alone has used more than 350,000 jin of scrap iron, such as broken pots, in casting scale components since the beginning of this year. The Xuzhou Farm Implement Factory successfully trial-produced a five-wheel waterwheel using scrap iron, such as broken pots, in August and has now put it into production. In particular, the Xuzhou Boiler Factory sent workers to study in other places and experimented with using scrap iron filings to cast pots, which not only ensured the quality of the iron pots but also saved a great deal of raw material value.

　　To save national foreign exchange, various factories have also come up with many ways to find substitutes for imported raw materials while ensuring product quality, and have achieved certain results. For example, in August, the Xuzhou Glass Factory researched and adopted dolomite and domestically produced borax to replace the imported borax that had been used for a long time. The Huaihai Tannery is also experimenting with using domestically produced roasted glue to replace imported roasted glue from Australia and South America for tanning heavy leather. In June and July, they successfully experimented with using sawdust (fine wood shavings) to replace all glucose as a reducing agent in chrome tanning liquor. This not only saves glucose for supply to medicine and other industries or for edible health needs, but also saves a great deal of value because sawdust is very cheap, and it promotes the reduction of leather costs while ensuring leather quality.

　　Substitutes have also been found to save grain. For example, sweet potato starch is used instead of flour for making paste. The Xuzhou Printing Factory's binding workshop alone saved 150 jin of flour in one month after starting to use it in August. The Xuzhou Vegetable Oil Factory successfully experimented with squeezing oil from flax seeds, finding a way to open up new oil sources and save grain.

　　徐州部分工厂节约原材料获得成效
    本报讯　江苏省徐州市地方工业各厂，为了克服原料供应不上的困难，积极研究和使用了代用品。如大镛五金工厂过去制造活络搬手的时候，全是使用不锈钢等金属材料，今年4月份研究试用烂炮弹皮代替全部不锈钢制造活络搬手成功后，即大量收购烂炮弹皮正式投入生产，每月可以节省不锈钢约三千斤；由于烂炮弹皮价钱比不锈钢便宜，成本也降低30％以上，产品质量也较前提高；搬手的韧性大大增加，基本上消灭了过去搬手发生断裂的毛病。这个厂制造弹子锁所用的铜料，大部也采用了代用品。其他五金机械铁工厂，如：徐州农业机械厂、美丰铁工厂、徐州锅厂及徐州农具厂等在采用代用品、节约优质钢铁等金属材料方面也作出了不少的成绩；仅美丰铁工厂在铸造台秤部件方面，今年以来就使用了三十五万多斤烂锅等废铁。徐州农具厂8月份利用烂锅等废铁试制成功了五轮水车，现在也投入了生产。尤其是徐州锅厂通过派工人赴外地学习，试用碎铁屑铸锅，不仅保证了铁锅的质量，而且节约原材料的价值很大。
    为了节省国家外汇，各厂在保证产品质量的前提下，在寻找进口原材料的代用品方面也想了不少办法，并且取得一定成效。如徐州玻璃厂8月份研究采用白云石及国产硼砂代替过去长期一贯使用的进口硼砂，淮海制革厂也正在试用国产烤胶代替进口的澳洲南美洲的烤胶鞣制重革，并且在六、七月份试用锯末（细木屑）代替全部葡萄糖作铬柔液还原剂成功，不仅可以省下葡萄糖供应医药等其他工业或供食用保健上的需要，而且由于锯末很便宜，节约价值很大，在保证皮革质量的前提下促使皮革成本的降低。
    在寻找代用品方面还找到了一些节约粮食的代用品，如利用甘薯淀粉代替面粉作浆糊，仅徐州印刷厂装订车间8月份开始使用的效果，一个月即节省了面粉一百五十斤。徐州植物油厂试用麻子榨油成功，为开辟新的油源节约粮食找到了道路。
