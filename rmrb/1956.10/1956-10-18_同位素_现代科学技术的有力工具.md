Isotopes—A Powerful Tool of Modern Science and Technology
　　Guo Tingzhang

Isotopes, as everyone knows, are the same in elemental properties, but their atomic properties (such as mass, radioactivity, etc.) are different. Therefore, we can use one isotope to study the laws of motion and change of an element and its compounds, and even the entire system. For example, using deuterium to study the properties of hydrogen, and using radioactive sodium to study the movement of sodium chloride (table salt) in the human body. Studying in this way can distinguish elements and their compounds from different sources in complex systems; under certain conditions, it can use modern, very accurate and relatively direct methods of measuring radioactivity or mass to measure this element or its compounds, especially radioactive measurements, which are simple and sensitive. At the same time, it can also be measured during the movement and change of matter and outside the system. In this way, using isotopes for research brings us great benefits: simplicity, sensitivity, speed, and enables us to delve into the internal workings of things, solve problems that could not be solved in the past, or obtain results that we did not expect.

We know that the objects studied and engaged in by natural science are precisely the laws of motion and change of matter, and their foundation is elements. Therefore, in principle, except for individual specialized disciplines, the isotope method can be applied in any scientific and technological sector. Their application can help us solve many major and complex problems and open up new research avenues in many scientific and technological fields. For example, photosynthesis, this is a very important biochemical reaction in nature. The reaction in which green plants use the energy of sunlight to synthesize carbohydrates, etc. from carbon dioxide and water, that is, the most basic reaction of how grains grow into grains, vegetables grow into vegetables, and trees grow into trees, that is, a reaction that farmers expect from nature through hard work. If people can understand and master this reaction process, they can seize more basic information necessary for daily life from nature. Scientists have long known about this reaction, but in the past there was no way to further study its detailed process. For example, where does the oxygen in carbohydrates come from? Does it come from carbon dioxide? Or from water? This is one of the problems that could not be solved in the past. Recently, thanks to the application of isotopes, research in this area has been greatly advanced. By using concentrated oxygen-18, we can know that oxygen comes from water; by using radioactive carbon, we can find that photosynthesis takes place in two steps: first, hydrides are produced under light; second, hydrides and carbon dioxide undergo chemical reactions in the body. These studies have discovered the carbon cycle and that the direct products of photosynthesis include not only sugars, but also proteins and cellulose.

Studying the movement and change of substances inside organisms has always been a very difficult thing, but now isotopes can be used to solve many problems. Scientists once injected radioactive phosphorus compounds into animals and then studied the speed of metabolism of these compounds in the animal's brain, and found that the speed of phosphorus protein metabolism was similar to the speed of adenosine triphosphate metabolism, proving that phosphorus protein plays an important role in the vital functions of nerve cells. Using radioactive phosphorus to study the brains of dogs, it was also found that when the brain is excited, the speed of metabolism of phospholipids, phosphorus proteins, etc. is significantly accelerated, while when the brain is inhibited, the synthesis of nucleic acids is faster than the decomposition. Similarly, using radioactive phosphorus to study the metabolism of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, diencephalon, medulla oblongata, spinal cord, etc. of dog brains, it was found that the metabolism of phosphorus in the cerebral cortex is the fastest, and so on. From these examples, it can be seen that the use of isotopes enables us to observe and study in the most complex parts of organisms.

The use of radiation itself is also a very important part of isotope application. For example, in the refining of gasoline from crude oil, Soviet scholars have studied that using radiation from radioactive cobalt to irradiate crude oil can decompose the crude oil into gasoline, and at the same time achieve the purpose of desulfurization. This can greatly change the face of gasoline production. Another example is the research of Soviet scholars on converting radiation energy into electrical energy. Soviet scholars used the reaction of water decomposing into hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide under radiation, with two suitable electrodes, such as platinum and gold electrodes, placed in the solution, and a current would continuously pass through the closed circuit under radiation. This opens up a new way for us to use radiation to generate electricity.

Here we might as well give another interesting example: Recently, scientists have been studying the method of treating tumors with slow neutrons. They use a boron compound to destroy cancer by exploiting the difference in concentration between the cancer and healthy tissues, and the alpha particles produced by boron under neutron irradiation, because the range of alpha particles in the tissues is not large, which can ensure that healthy tissues are not destroyed. This research is undoubtedly a very promising new avenue.

The widespread application of isotopes in the Soviet Union and other countries has only been in recent years, but the achievements made in such a short period of time would already be difficult to list one by one. For example, in industry, radioactive isotopes have been used to manufacture various instruments for inspecting machine parts or metal products, instruments for inspecting liquid levels, instruments for measuring thickness or weight, equipment for eliminating static electricity and new automatic control equipment, studying smelting processes, studying metal corrosion and diffusion, studying mechanical wear and conducting rapid analysis, etc., which have played a huge role in reforming the production process and improving labor productivity; in agriculture, studying the laws of plant absorption of nutrients and inventing "cold" disinfection and sterilization methods have made great contributions to increasing crop production and preserving agricultural products; in geology, using natural radioactive isotopes to study the laws of rock formation and distribution and neutron logging, etc. are also of great significance to the national economy; the role in medicine is a well-known fact. In recent years, the use of isotopes in physiological and pathological research and in diagnosis and treatment has yielded some revolutionary results.

Isotopes are a powerful tool in modern science and technology, and their widespread application will bring more and greater achievements to various fields of science and technology.

    同位素——现代科学技术的有力工具
    郭挺章
    同位素，正如大家所晓得的，它们在元素性质上是相同的，但是它们的原子粒性质（如质量、放射性等）不同，所以我们可以利用一种同位素来研究一种元素和它的化合物、甚至整个体系的运动变化的规律。如用氢二来研究氢的性质，用放射性钠来研究氯化钠（食盐）在人体内的运行情况。用这种方法研究能够把复杂体系中不同来源的元素和它的化合物区别开来；在一定条件下，它可以利用近代很准确的而比较直接的测量放射性或质量的方法把这种元素或者它的化合物测量出来，特别是放射性的测量，既简单又灵敏，同时还可以在物质运动变化的过程中和在体系的外部测量它。这样，使用同位素来进行研究就给我们带来很大的好处：简便、灵敏、迅速，并且使我们能够深入事物的内部，解决一些过去不能解决的问题，或得到一些我们预期不到的结果。
    我们知道自然科学所研究的和从事的对象正是物质的运动、变化的规律，它们的基础是元素，所以原则上除了个别的专门学科外，同位素方法是可以在任何一种科学技术部门中应用的。它们的应用可以帮助我们解决许多重大的复杂问题，使我们在许多科学技术领域内开辟了新的研究途径。如光合作用，这是自然界中一个很重要的生物化合反应。绿色植物借助太阳光的能把二氧化碳和水合成碳水化合物等的反应，也就是谷物怎样长成为谷物，蔬菜怎样长成为蔬菜，树木怎样长成为树木一个最基本的反应，也就是农民辛勤劳动所期待于自然的一个反应。如果人们能够了解和掌握这个反应过程，就能向自然夺取更多的日常生活所必需的基本资料。科学家们很早就知道这个反应，但是过去一直没有办法进一步研究它的详细过程。比如说碳水化合物中的氧到底是从二氧化碳中来的呢？还是从水中来的？这就是过去无法解决的问题之一。最近由于应用了同位素，很快就使这方面的研究工作推进了一步。利用浓集了的同位素氧十八，就可以知道氧是从水中来的；利用放射性碳，就可以发现光合作用分两步进行：第一步，在光下生成氢化物；第二步，氢化物和二氧化碳在体内起化合作用。这些研究发现了碳的循环，发现了光合作用的直接产物除了醣类，还有蛋白质和纤维素等。
    研究有机体内部物质的运动和变化一直是一件十分困难的事情，现在利用了同位素就可以解决不少问题了。科学家们曾经用放射性磷的化合物注射到动物体内，然后研究在动物脑内这些化合物新陈代谢的速度，发现磷蛋白质的新陈代谢速度和三磷酸腺甙新陈代谢的速度差不多，证明磷蛋白质在神经细胞的生活机能中起着重要的作用。用放射性磷研究狗的大脑，还发现在大脑兴奋的时候，磷脂、磷蛋白质等新陈代谢的速度显著地加快，而在大脑抑制的时候，核酸的合成就比分解来的快。同样，用放射性磷研究狗脑的大脑半球皮质、小脑、间脑、延髓、脊髓等的代谢作用，发现了大脑半球皮质中磷的新陈代谢最快，等等。从这些例子可以看出，利用同位素使我们能够在最复杂的有机体部分进行观察和研究。
    射线本身的利用在同位素应用上也是一个很重要的内容。如从原油提炼汽油，苏联学者研究，利用放射性钴的射线来照射，就能使原油分解成汽油，同时还可以达到去硫的目的。这就可以大大改变生产汽油的面貌。另一个例子是苏联学者对变辐射能为电能的研究。苏联学者利用水在射线的照射下分解为氢和过氧化氢的反应，在溶液中装着两个合适的电极，例如铂和金的电极，在射线的照射下就会有电流不断通过闭合的电路。这就给我们开辟了利用射线发电的一个新途径。
    这里不妨再举一个有趣的例子：最近科学家们正在研究用慢中子治瘤的方法。他们利用一种硼化物通过癌和健康体素时浓度上的差异以及硼在中子照射下产生的甲种粒子来破坏癌，因为甲种粒子在体素中射程不大，这样就可以保证健康体素的不受破坏。这种研究，无疑是很有前途的一个新途径。
    在苏联和其他国家广泛应用同位素还是最近几年的事情，但是就在这样短的时间内所取得的成就，如果我们要把它们一一罗列出来，就已经是不容易的了。例如在工业上利用放射性同位素制成了各种检查机件或者金属品的仪器，检查液面水平的仪器，测量厚度或者重量的仪器，消除静电以及新型自动控制的设备，研究冶炼过程，研究金属腐蚀和扩散，研究机械磨损以及进行快速分析等等，不管在改革生产过程上或者在提高劳动生产率上都起了巨大的作用；在农业上研究植物吸收养料的规律以及发明“冷的”消毒杀菌法，对农作物的增产和农产品的保存等都有很大的贡献；在地质上利用天然放射性同位素研究岩石的形成和分布的规律以及中子测井等对国民经济也有很大的意义；在医学上的作用更是尽人皆知的事实。近年来由于利用同位素在生理和病理的研究上、在诊断治疗上都有一些革命性的成果。
    同位素是现代科学技术上的一种有力的工具，它的广泛应用将给各门科学技术带来更多更大的成就。
