    The Troublesome Things Are Yours, the Profitable Things Are Mine
    Chen Zequn
    A factory repeatedly received instructions from the competent department, saying that in order to strengthen economic activity analysis, it was first necessary to rectify the basic-level records. This was indeed a complex and cumbersome task, and for some people who were afraid of "trouble," it seemed quite hot to handle. So, a dispute arose. The head of the planning section said, "According to a report I heard, this work should be done by your finance and accounting section!" The head of the finance and accounting section also had other ideas, saying, "According to what I saw during visits to many advanced factories, this work is all done by your planning section!" They pushed back and forth, a truly "humble" scene to behold. Both sides seemed unable to find any basis to publicly cancel this work, but neither side was willing to take on this "troublesome" matter. Finally, after repeated "compromises" by the secretarial department, the disputing parties reluctantly agreed to "do it together," but then argued over who should be "in charge," neither side willing to take the "lead," and the work was shelved. Of course, both disputing parties were "victorious," and only the work itself suffered.
    However, not long after, the end of the year arrived. The two section chiefs then argued about the basic-level records again. The planning section had to rush to prepare the annual report, and the finance and accounting section had to prepare the annual final accounts. They both wanted to pull the basic-level record keepers, whom they had originally been unwilling to manage, to help. So, they quoted classics and argued red-faced, saying that there were instructions from higher authorities to check, and articles in certain publications to prove that the basic-level record keepers should be managed by "me" and had nothing to do with "you," reversing their previous "humble" style.
    The different arguments of these two debaters clearly showed the same thought existing in both minds: "The troublesome things are yours, the profitable things are mine."
    This is an unspeakable thought, so they insisted on finding "evidence" in their respective notebooks. In fact, as long as their previous and subsequent remarks were cross-referenced, and they were asked to present their true opinions, they would blush and stammer.

    麻烦的事归你，合算的事归我
    陈泽群
    一家工厂屡次地接到主管部局的指示，说是为了加强经济活动分析，首先必须整顿好基层纪录。这的确是一项复杂而繁琐的工作，对某些怕“麻烦”的人来说，似乎是很有些烫手的。于是争执便发生了。计划科长说：“根据我听过的一个报告，这项工作应该你们财会科搞！”财会科长也另有想法，说：“根据我在许多先进厂参观所见，这项工作都是由你们计划科搞！”推来推去，真是“谦让”之状可掬。双方似乎都还找不到任何根据来公然取消这项工作，可又双方都不愿揽这项“麻烦”事。最后，经过秘书部门再三“折衷”，争论的双方才勉强同意“大家一道搞”，但又在谁“为主”的问题上推让起来，双方都不愿做“主”，这项工作便被搁浅下来了。争论的双方当然都是“胜利者”，只有工作本身倒了霉。
    但是，过了不久，年终来临。那两位科长就又为基层纪录争执起来，计划科要赶办年报，而财会科也要准备年度决算。他们都要拉原先他们都不愿管的基层纪录员来帮忙，于是又引经据典，面红耳赤，说是有上级的指示可查，有某某刊物的文章可证，基层纪录员理当归“我”管，与“你”无干，一反其过去的“谦让”作风了。
    这两位争论家的先后不同的争论，显然表现出存在于两个头脑中的同样的思想：“麻烦的事归你，合算的事归我”。
    这是说不出口的思想，所以硬要在各自笔记本里找“根据”。其实只要把他们的前言后语加以对证，要他们拿出自己的真正见解来，他们就会口呐脸红了。
