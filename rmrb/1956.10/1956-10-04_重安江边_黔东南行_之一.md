    After another winding mountain slope, we would arrive at the scenic upper reaches of the Qingshui River—Chong'an River Town. To wait for the following convoy, the car stopped halfway up the mountain. We got out of the car and saw the clear stream crawling at our feet from afar (which couldn’t help but remind me of the ancient, rusty iron-chain bridge in Jiangkou). Several red flags fluttered in the breeze, and a vast contingent of fraternal nationalities gathered along the river. The continuous undulating mountains and lush forests were a little farther away from us. The air after the rain was particularly fresh, and the scene before us seemed a bit more open.
    The children at the foot of the mountain had already spotted us. With a shout, they ran up the slope like flying. Most of them were "Young Pioneers," and some even wore badges from Chong'an River Town Elementary School. Different outfits, but completely the same in cleanliness and neatness. Some were barefoot in cloth shoes, some wore straw sandals, some held a bamboo hat, and some carried an umbrella under their arms. There were also two dark-faced children, one tall and one short, sweat streaming down their foreheads, running and using the bamboo hats in their hands as weapons, chasing swarms of dragonflies. Each of them had a smile on their face, surrounding us, and all we heard was a noisy chorus: "We've been waiting for you by the river since nine o'clock this morning, waiting like waiting for stars in the dark night, and it's so hard to finally see you!"
    We shook hands with them one by one and thanked them for their trouble. Some comrades rushed to pick up the youngest children, wearing Miao costumes.
    Comrade He, who was in the same car, grabbed a plump girl of thirteen or fourteen with green ribbon in her black hair and asked, "Do you know what we're here for?"
    "How could we not know!" She raised her fluffy head, rolled her small eyes, smiled slightly, and replied quickly: "The teachers have told us so many times, our Miao and Dong people are celebrating a happy event, establishing an autonomous prefecture, and you are here to congratulate us, right?"
    I gently patted her left shoulder and said, "You answered perfectly, little girl!"
    She was so excited that her voice even trembled a little, and continued, "My parents are waiting for you by the river. They've opened a jar of homemade old wine, aged for many years, and want to invite you to drink. My mother also said that she never dreamed of such a happy event of being masters of our own house, and that she hasn’t lived in vain!"
    What touching actions and words! We immediately expressed that we would definitely drink a few cups to thank them later.
    Someone in the group of children asked in a rough voice, "Has Chairman Mao come? Has Vice Chairman Zhu come?"
    The tall Comrade Wang leaned down towards them and replied kindly, "Children, Chairman Mao didn't come, but he sent representatives."
    A thin, tall child with a protruding forehead told us (he stuttered a little and breathed somewhat rapidly): "The countryside has long been rumored that Chairman Mao didn't come during the land reform, and he didn't come when we first started collectivization. This time he is coming here for the establishment of the prefecture. One person tells ten, ten tell a hundred, and the news spread like wind to every village." We then understood that the children's inquiries were not without reason.
    The Dong girl standing on my left, with bright black eyes and large silver hook earrings, held her little brother's right hand and said to the children in a very gentle voice: "You know how busy Chairman Mao is every day! He has so many big things to do. If he can't come, sending a representative is the same, isn't it?"
    A high-pitched voice: "It's the same, it's the same. Wait a moment, we'll put a red scarf on the representatives, do you all agree?"
    "Yes! Yes!" the children replied in unison.
    Hearing that we were going to stay in Huangping that night, they all had objections and insisted on us staying in Chong'an River Town. Thinking that we were afraid of not having enough room because of the large number of people, the girl with the green hair band straightened her chest and spoke again from the crowd: "Chong'an River is very big, there are many hotels. If the representatives still don't have enough room, they can stay at our school, I'll go talk to the principal." After speaking, she raised her legs and was about to run down the slope. I pulled her back hard and told her very tactfully that Huangping had already made preparations for us and that the plan could not be changed.
    She was very disappointed, crossed her hands, pouted her mouth, and repeatedly told us: "Representatives, when you come back, play in our Chong'an River for a week or two, take your time leaving!"
    A boy wearing a self-woven and self-dyed blue cloth jacket walked over slowly, quietly tugged at my clothes, nudged his mouth behind me, and asked:
    "Is that comrade a Soviet friend? Has he come to congratulate us too!"
    I turned my head to look and couldn't help but laugh. It turned out he was referring to Representative Chen, whose skin was red, his eyes were deep-set, and with his head of yellow hair, he did look a bit like a foreigner at first glance.
    I quickly told him that Representative Chen was not a Soviet, but a Buyi. The child ran over to him in surprise, and the two, one big and one small, squatted under the shade of a tree, chatting very warmly.
    The Buyi girl Meng Sufen, who had been to Moscow, also took the initiative to run over and asked the two Miao girls about their lives, as if they were old friends reunited. Immediately, a large group of children surrounded Meng Sufen. Some had seen her photo a year or two ago, some knew about her advanced deeds, and some had heard her reports. The children all seized the opportunity to chat with her and ask her to tell them stories about the Soviet Union.
    Finally, the sound of the loudspeaker came from far to near, followed by the constant rumble of vehicles, and the convoy that had been delayed in Lushan arrived an hour later. The children all ran down the slope to report the news. We lined up and slowly walked towards the Chong'an River. In an instant, we were swept into a welcoming torrent of lusheng and suona ensembles, and mangtong and bronze drums competing.

    重安江边
    ——“黔东南行”之一
    蹇先艾
    再下一个蜿蜒的山坡，就要到达山明水秀的清水江上游——重安江镇了。为了等候后面的车队，车子在半山上停下来了。我们下了车，远远就望见了匍伏在我们脚下的清流（不由使我想起江口那座古锈斑烂的铁索桥）。几面红旗在微风中飘动，沿江云集着兄弟民族的浩浩荡荡的队伍。连绵起伏和树林蓊郁的大山离我们稍稍远了一点。雨后的空气特别新鲜，眼前的景象也显得有些开阔。
    山麓的儿童们已经发现了我们，一声呐喊，飞也似地跑上坡来了。他们大半都是“红领巾”，有些胸前还挂着重安江镇小学的证章。不同的打扮，清洁和整齐又完全相同。有的赤脚穿布鞋，有的穿草履，有的拿着一个斗笠，有的胁下挟着雨伞。还有两个面貌黧黑的孩子，一高一矮，额上淌着汗，一面跑步，一面把手里的斗笠当武器，追扑着往来成群的蜻蜓。他们每个人的脸上都带着笑容，把我们团团围起来，只听见一片嘈杂的声音：“我们早晨九点就在江边等你们，像黑夜盼星星一样，等到这个时候，好容易把你们等来了！”
    我们跟他们一一握手，道了辛苦。有些同志就抢着把那几个年纪最小的、穿着苗家服装的孩子抱了起来。
    同车的贺同志一把拉住一个十三四岁的、黑发系着绿带的胖女孩问道：“你们晓得我们来做什么吗？”
      “还怕不知道！”她抬起了蓬松的头，转动着小眼珠，微微笑了一笑，回答得很敏捷：“老师给我们讲过好多回了，我们苗族、侗族办喜事，建立自治州，你们是来给我们贺喜的，是不是？”
    我在她的左肩膀上轻轻地拍着说：“你回答得一点都不错呀，小姑娘！”
    她兴奋得声音都带点颤抖，接下去说道：“我爹妈都在江边等你们哩，他们打开了一坛自己烤的老酒，窖了好多年的，要请你们吃。妈还说，赶上这种当家作主的大喜事，她连做梦都想不到，这一辈子算是没有白活了！”
    这是多么感人的行动和言语啊！我们立刻就表示回头一定要痛饮几杯来答谢他们。
    孩子群中有人粗声粗气地问：“毛主席来了没有？朱副主席来了没有？”
    身材高大的王同志把身子俯向他们，和蔼地回答道：“小朋友们，毛主席没有来，派了代表来了。”
    一个瘦高的、前额凸出的儿童告诉了我们：（他说话有点口吃，呼吸也就有些急促）“乡下好久就传说着，土地改革的时候毛主席没有来，开头搞合作化的时候也没有来，这回建州他要到这里来了，一传十，十传百，消息像刮风一样吹到了村村寨寨”。我们才明白孩子们的打听并不是没有道理的。
    站在我左边的那位眼睛黑亮、戴着银钩大耳环的侗家姑娘，右手牵着她的小弟弟，语音很柔和地和孩子们说：“你们晓得毛主席一天多么忙啊！要办多少大事情。他不能来，派代表来了，还不是一样吗？”
    一个尖高的声音：“是一样，是一样。等一会儿，我们给代表挂上一条红领巾，你们大家说好不好？”
      “好！好！”孩子们齐声回答。
    听说我们那天晚上要住黄平，他们都有意见，一定要留我们住在重安江镇上。以为我们是因为人多，怕住不下，系绿发带的那位姑娘挺着胸脯在人丛中又发言了：“重安江大得很，有许多家旅馆，代表们再住不下，就到我们学校住吧，我去给校长讲。”说完，她拔起腿就要往坡下跑。我用力一把将她拉回来，很委婉地告诉她黄平已经给我们作了准备，计划没有法子改变了。
    她感到非常失望，交义着双手，噘起嘴，再三地叮嘱我们：代表，你们回来的时候，在我们重安江玩个把星期，慢去！”
    有个穿着自织自染的青布对襟短褂的男孩慢步走过来，悄悄地扯了一下我的衣服，把嘴往我背后一努，问道：
      “那位同志是不是苏联朋友？他也给我们贺喜来了！”
    我回转头去看，忍不住发起笑来。原来他指的是陈代表，他的皮肤发红，两眼深陷，加上一头的黄发，乍看起来，的确有点像一个外国人。
    我忙给他说，陈代表不是苏联人，是布依族。那个孩子很惊奇地就跑过去找他，一大一小蹲在树荫下，很亲热地谈起天来了。
    曾经到过莫斯科的布依族姑娘蒙素芬也主动地跑来，拉着两个苗家女孩子问长问短，她们好像旧友重逢一样。马上一大群儿童就把蒙素芬包围起来。有的前两年就看见过她的像片，有些人知道她的先进事迹，还有些人听过她的报告。孩子们都抓住机会同她畅谈，要她讲一讲苏联的故事。
    终于，喇叭声由远而近，随之而起的是辚辚不断的车行声，逗遛在炉山的车队一小时以后就到来了。小朋友们都纷纷跑下坡去报信。整好了队伍，缓步走向重安江边，顷刻间，我们就卷入了芦笙和唢呐合奏、蟒筒和铜鼓争鸣的欢迎的洪流里。
