    Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 14th – The First Automobile Works has begun to establish a normal production order in advance of full-scale mass production of automobiles.

    In recent days, the general production control center of the factory has continuously issued instructions from the factory director and chief engineer. Various workshops and supply departments have been delivering various automobile assemblies and parts to the central hub of automobile production – the general assembly workshop – on a daily and timely basis. At the end of the general assembly line, "Liberation" brand trucks are continuously rolling off.

    The mass flow production of the First Automobile Works requires close coordination between all departments of the factory. Any interruption in any link will disrupt the entire rhythmic production. At present, the First Automobile Works has begun to establish the management order necessary to organize various production activities. Since the adjustment of production, leaders at all levels and all employees throughout the factory have successively studied the organization design and advanced management experience of Soviet automobile factories. Under the principle of "learning while implementing," they have established various management systems for production, planning, and technology, combined with the specific conditions of the factory. Based on the characteristics of mass flow production, a production dispatch network consisting of more than twenty production dispatch stations has also been installed throughout the factory.

    第一汽车厂建立正常生产秩序
    解放牌汽车不断从总装配车间开出来
    新华社长春14日电　在全面开工大量生产汽车以前，第一汽车制造厂已经开始建立起正常的生产秩序。
    连日来，这个厂的总生产调度台不断地下达着厂长和总工程师的指令，各车间和供应部门都按日按时地把各种汽车的总成、零件等送到汽车生产的活动中心——总装配车间里来。在总装配线的终点，不间断地开出“解放”牌载重汽车。
    第一汽车制造厂的大量流水生产，要求全厂各部门必须紧密地配合，任何一个环节发生停顿，都会破坏整个有节奏的生产。目前，第一汽车制造厂已经开始建立起组织各项生产所必需的管理秩序。从调整生产以来，全厂各级领导和全体职工，都先后学习了组织设计和苏联汽车工厂的先进管理经验，在“边学习，边贯彻”的方针下，结合本厂的具体情况，建立了生产、计划和技术等各种管理制度。根据大量流水生产的特点，还在全厂装设了由二十多个生产调度台组成的生产调度网。
