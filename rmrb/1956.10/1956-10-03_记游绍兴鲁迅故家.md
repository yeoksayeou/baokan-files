    A Visit to Lu Xun's Former Home in Shaoxing
    Yuan Shuipai
    We arrived at the back garden of Xintai Gate, which is the Hundred Herb Garden described in "Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk." There have been many changes here, but the low mud wall is still the original one from back then. Many wildflowers and weeds still grow on it. Mr. Lu Xun once called this his childhood paradise, "Just the area around the short mud wall was full of endless interest." However, today's children who come here to visit may be surprised that Mr. Lu Xun appreciated such a barren garden and such an unremarkable low wall. Today, the parks and children's palaces they can go to for amusement are many times better than this.
    New and Old Tai Gates and the memorial hall are all located on the street originally named "Dongchangfangkou," now called Lu Xun Road. As mentioned earlier, the street is close to the river. Facing the Old Tai Gate across the river, connected by a stone bridge, is the third house related to Mr. Lu Xun's childhood, Sanwei Study. "Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk" has the following record: "Going out from Xintai Gate to the east, not even half a mile, crossing a stone bridge, is my teacher's house. Entering through a black lacquered bamboo door, the third room is the study. In the middle hangs a plaque that reads: Sanwei Study; below the plaque is a painting of a very fat sika deer lying under an ancient tree."
    Now, the black lacquered bamboo door is still there, the plaque is still there, and the ancient painting of the sika deer is still there, but usually a replica is hung to replace the original, in order to preserve the cultural relic.
    The interior and exterior walls have been repainted white, but even so, the room is still very dark. Mr. Lu Xun's seat was in the northeast corner under the wall, where the light was even darker. The desks and chairs in the study are very crowded, and can only accommodate twelve children. It is said that a foreign guest who came to visit not long ago was very moved by the lives of children in our old times when he saw this situation. When visiting a local primary school named after Lu Xun, this foreign guest even used this point to encourage the primary school students.
    Shaoxing now has nine secondary schools and more than two hundred primary schools.
    We also went to the small garden behind the Sanwei Study that Mr. Lu Xun wrote about. There is still the flowerbed where Mr. Lu Xun used to climb to pick wintersweet flowers. The wintersweet is still alive, but the osmanthus tree on which he said he used to look for cicada molts is gone. The current one was replanted by the memorial hall. (The End) (Attached pictures)

    记游绍兴鲁迅故家
    袁水拍
    我们走到了新台门的后园，那就是“朝花夕拾”里写到的百草园。这里也有了很大的变动，但一垛矮矮的泥墙，却还是当年原有的。上面仍然长着许多野花杂草。这里曾经被鲁迅先生称为他幼年时代的乐园，“单是周围的短短的泥墙根一带，就有无限趣味。”可是，今天的儿童来到这里参观的时候，也许会惊讶鲁迅先生为什么欣赏起这样一个荒园和这一垛平淡无奇的矮墙来。今天，他们所能够去游乐的公园、少年宫不知要比这里好多少倍了。
    新、老台门以及纪念馆都座落在原名“东昌坊口”、现名鲁迅路的街道上。前面已经说过，街道紧靠着河。同老台门隔河相望，有石板桥可通的第三座同幼年时代的鲁迅先生有关的房屋，就是三味书屋。“朝花夕拾”中有这样的记载，从新台门“出门向东，不上半里，走过一道石桥，便是我的先生的家了。从一扇黑油的竹门进去，第三间是书房。中间挂着一块匾道：三味书屋；匾下面是一幅画，画着一只很肥大的梅花鹿伏在古树下。”
    现在，黑油竹门还在，匾也还在，梅花鹿的古画也还在，只是平时挂了一幅复制品，来代替原作，以便保存文物。
    屋内外墙壁都已重新刷白，即使这样，屋里还是很暗。鲁迅先生的座位在东北角墙下，那儿的光线更暗。书房里，桌椅摆得很挤，也还只能容纳十二个儿童。听说一位不久以前来参观的外宾看到这情形，对我们旧时代的儿童的生活很有感慨，这位外宾在参观当地一所以鲁迅为名的小学时，还用这一点来鼓励过小学生们。
    绍兴现在已经有九个中等学校和二百多个小学校了。
    鲁迅先生所写到的三味书屋后面的一个小园，我们也去了。那里依旧有当时鲁迅先生曾经爬上去折腊梅花的花坛，腊梅至今还活着，只是他所说的他曾在上面找过蝉蜕的那株桂花树，已经没有了，现在的一株是纪念馆补种的。　（续完）（附图片）
