Lu Xun, in the preface to his "Eryi Ji" (a collection of essays from 1930-31) written in April 1932, said the following when reviewing the course of his ideological development: "I merely used to detest this familiar class of my own, not regretting its demise at all. Later, taught by the facts, I believed that only the emerging proletariat has a future." With this belief, under the ideological leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Lu Xun resolutely served the people, resolutely fought against reactionary forces of all kinds, and devoted himself to the cause until the last minute of his life.

Just like many other great writers, thinkers, and social activists known to the world – here, I think of the shining names of Shaw, Romain Rolland, Dreiser, etc. – the road Lu Xun traveled was a long and arduous one, not only filled with thorns, but also with wolves in power, lurking ghosts, and foxes dancing in skulls.
	"I set out in the morning from Cangwu, and in the evening I arrived at Xuanyuan;
	I wanted to linger a little in this spirit realm, but the day was suddenly drawing to a close.
	I ordered Xihe to slow down his pace, looking towards Yanshan and not urging him to hasten;
	The road is long and stretches far, I will search high and low."

In 1926, Lu Xun used the above-quoted verses from Qu Yuan as an inscription at the beginning of his collection of short stories "Wandering"; this indicated that at that time he embraced the spirit of our ancient philosophers, "If I hear the Dao in the morning, I can die content in the evening," fighting while pursuing the truth. At that time, his basic attitude can be explained by his later evaluation of "Yu Si" (a weekly magazine launched in 1924, with which Lu Xun had the longest relationship); he said that "Yu Si" unintentionally revealed a characteristic: "Talking arbitrarily, without scruples, urging the emergence of the new, and exerting all efforts to attack the old that is harmful to the new – but it does not clearly indicate what kind of 'new' should emerge, and when it feels somewhat harmful, it still deliberately uses vague terms. ... So, the reason for using vague terms is only to make it so that when the running dogs smell it and run to offer their services, they must explain it in detail, which requires relatively more effort and cannot be straightforward and enjoyable, so that they can get some benefits."

This passage explains the attitude and fighting method of the magazine "Yu Si." Of course, Lu Xun did not have no goals at that time regarding "what kind of 'new' should emerge." But the reason why Lu Xun did not clearly express it was precisely because he refused to act as someone else's eyes and make any expressions before having a deep understanding. This is consistent with his spirit of firmly believing "later, taught by the facts."

I personally have this feeling: if we compare Lu Xun with Romain Rolland, there are many similarities. When Romain Rolland was seventy years old, he said the following in response to the Soviet people's celebration of him: "Thank you for commemorating my seventieth birthday, which seems like the end of a journey – from Paris to Moscow. I have arrived. This journey was not smooth, but it ended well." Romain Rolland, in explaining "from what place, from what era's depths I came," painfully said that his childhood and youth were spent under the heavy burden of pessimism. Similarly, Lu Xun also experienced the heavy burden of "loneliness and emptiness," and Lu Xun's "journey" seems to have been even more arduous than Romain Rolland's, because he not only carried the "inherited burden of a three-thousand-year-old feudal empire, bearing the gate of darkness," but he also had to fight against the "comprador culture" formed by the semi-colonial society of the past hundred years.

The son of a scholarly family, reciting the words of Confucius and Mencius in his youth, learning the science of sound, light, electricity, and chemistry when he grew up, and walking from revolutionary democracy to communism: Lu Xun's path like this reminds me of our many predecessors. This is the path chosen by Chinese patriotic intellectuals after being taught by the facts. In the 1920s and 1930s, Lu Xun was the standard-bearer guiding thousands of young intellectuals towards struggle and towards such a path.

Our ancient philosophers said: only the "benevolent" (revolutionary humanitarians) are able to love people and hate people. Lu Xun was such a "benevolent man." He defended the dignity of "man," he loved the insulted and the injured, and he hated the exploiters and oppressors. Such a "benevolent man" must also be a great patriot; and in semi-feudal and semi-colonial China, a great patriot must also be an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal warrior. Lu Xun's central thoughts and main activities before 1930 can probably be summarized in these few words.

In 1906, while studying in Japan, Lu Xun began planning a literary movement. This was a plan to publish a journal called "New Life." But this plan ultimately failed due to various obstacles. Later (in the preface to "Call to Arms," 1922), he looked back on this period and told us: the reason why he wanted to promote the literary movement was because literature is good at changing people's spirits, and the reason why he regarded changing spirits as the top priority was because he recognized that "all foolish and weak nationals, even if their physiques are sound and vigorous, can only be used as meaningless materials for public display and onlookers."

"Can only be used as meaningless materials for public display and onlookers" – this is Lu Xun's most painful statement about the fate of the Chinese people at that time. Why "can only be used as materials for public display and onlookers"? Lu Xun analyzed from various aspects and revealed the essence of the problem.

With infinite sorrow, starting from "Diary of a Madman," he took materials from "unfortunate people in a morbid society" and pointed out sharply and satirically the chronic diseases of "national character" caused by feudal ideology and imperialist cultural aggression. "Diary of a Madman" used the mouth of a "madman" to speak out the cannibalistic essence of the thousands of years of "rites" – the ideological system of the Chinese feudal system; his madness was precisely the result of persecution by feudal ethics.

The meaning of "Medicine" is even more far-reaching and poignant. One of the "unfortunate people in a morbid society" sought "medicine" to save his life, but this so-called "medicine that cures all kinds of consumptive diseases" (a steamed bun dipped in human blood) was not only like a deceptive witchcraft, but the human blood, which was said to be the source of "efficacy," was the blood of a revolutionary, that is, the blood offered for the sake of the "unfortunate people in a morbid society"! Here, Lu Xun's grief and indignation were twofold. He was both grieved by the people's being poisoned by feudal ideas and not awakened, and also criticized the revolutionary movement at that time (on the eve of the Xinhai Revolution) for being divorced from the people. Later, Lu Xun himself explained the intention of "Medicine": "Because the commander ("May Fourth" Movement period) did not advocate negativity," and also did not want to "infect the youth who were having good dreams like I was when I was young with my own loneliness," so "I spared no effort to use a euphemistic pen, and added a wreath to Yu's (the revolutionary who was killed) grave for no reason"; that is to say, the far-reaching implication of "Medicine" lies not in the "wreath" but in the profound contradictions expressed in the entire article. Based on his own eyewitness experience of the failure of the Xinhai Revolution, Lu Xun pointed out a truth through the story of "Medicine": if revolutionary ideas do not grasp the masses, then the blood of pioneers may only be used as materials for "steamed buns dipped in human blood"; and to make the masses accept revolutionary ideas, one must first open the shackles of their minds and make them open their eyes to see – in Lu Xun's own words, it is to "expose the pain and arouse attention to treatment," that is, to "change their spirits."

"The True Story of Ah Q" reveals the chronic diseases of "national character" on a larger scale and with more far-reaching significance. In terms of economic status, Ah Q is a working person, but in Ah Q, in addition to some qualities of the working people, there are also many ideological consciousness of the feudal class, and these ideological consciousness precisely become Ah Q's mental shackles and anesthetics; but even so, when a revolution occurred in China, Ah Q became a revolutionary party, but he was "not allowed to revolt" and was finally taken by the newly rich fake revolutionaries, who had been transformed, as material for "public display." This is not only Ah Q's personal tragedy, but also the tragedy of the Xinhai Revolution. Some people thought that Ah Q's finally becoming a revolutionary party was not in line with Ah Q's character. In 1926, Lu Xun replied in "The Causes of the True Story of Ah Q": "According to my meaning, if China does not have a revolution, Ah Q will not do it. Since there is a revolution, he will do it. The fate of my Ah Q can only be like this, and the personality is probably not two. ... If there are further reforms in the future, I believe that there will still be revolutionary parties like Ah Q appearing. I am also very willing, as people say, that I only wrote about the past or a period of time before the present, but I am still afraid that what I see is not the predecessor of the modern, but its successor, or even twenty or thirty years later." These last few words allude to the revolution of 1927, which was about to come at that time. Lu Xun was not optimistic, or even pessimistic, about that revolution. This will be discussed further in the next section.

If Ah Q's typical character is only regarded as a farmhand, and if Ah Q's story is only regarded as a reflection of the failure of the Xinhai Revolution, then it cannot explain its complexity and profoundness. In the old society, the so-called "Ah Q face" was universally present; from the "high-ranking officials" to the "gentlemen" (hypocrites), intellectuals, citizens, and even the working people, all had some "spiritual qualities" of Ah Q more or less. Because, the constituent factors of the so-called "Ah Q face" are none other than the class concepts and selfish and self-interested ideological consciousness produced by the exploitative system of class society, plus the policy of deceiving the people of the ruling class, which is half-feudal and half-colonial. When "The True Story of Ah Q" was continuously published in the newspaper, some "gentlemen" (hypocrites) and noble gentlemen were uneasy and thought that they were being scolded. Their uneasiness was really justified, because their faces were reflected in the mirror of Ah Q. Seriously speaking, even today, we are afraid that we cannot completely affirm that there is no shadow of ourselves in the mirror of Ah Q. Even if it is just a faint shadow, it is still a shadow after all! This is because, although the social system has changed, the remnants of the ideological consciousness produced by the old society and the old system cannot be immediately eliminated in people's minds.

There is no need to avoid the fact that the picture of "The True Story of Ah Q" is quite dark, and Lu Xun's emphasis on the chronic diseases of national character is not without bias, that is, neglecting the advantages of the Chinese people's character. Although this can be explained by "bitter medicine is good for the disease," it is also related to Lu Xun's understanding of history at that time. Lu Xun once quoted the words of one of his friends in another article and expressed sympathy: in history, the Chinese only have two eras: being a stable slave and seeking to be a slave but not being able to. This obviously underestimated the role of the people in Chinese history. But Lu Xun at the time of saying these words had only indignation and depression, and was by no means decadent. Just like the inner thoughts he expressed in "Wild Grass," despite contradictions and depression, he was not decadent. He was still fighting resolutely, and at the same time, he was tirelessly pursuing the truth. This is precisely why Lu Xun became great.

	×　　×　　×

Lu Xun's depression at that time – in his own often-used words, the feeling of emptiness and loneliness – and the "loneliness" that he deeply felt painful day by day before the "May Fourth" (the period from 1911 to 1918), growing up like a big poisonous snake and entwining his soul, have similarities in nature, but also have differences. The similarity lies in the fact that he compared the reactionary trend of the right-wing elements of the "May Fourth" Movement and the fact that those who originally opposed the "May Fourth" Movement were also selling dog meat with a sheep's head in an attempt to usurp leadership with the defeat of the Xinhai Revolution that he witnessed, and thus felt acutely the sadness of "the world is still the same." (In "The True Story of Ah Q," he described Zhao Xiucai and fake foreigners taking the opportunity to "revolt," "renewing everything," and not allowing Ah Q to revolt. His pen pointed towards the opportunists after the "May Fourth" Movement.) The difference lies in the fact that he also witnessed or at least felt a tenacious undercurrent in the turbulent era, "like a sprout under a large stone, growing tortuously," in that besides the theory of evolution that he had always believed in, he also "squeezed" in new things – the theory of class struggle and the emergence of the first socialist country. This difference marked the development of Lu Xun's thought. And reflecting his ideological struggle and indignant emotions during this period is "Wild Grass" (prose poems, more than 20 pieces, written in Beijing from 1924 to 1926). Later (in 1931), he himself made the following explanation for "Wild Grass": "It can also be said that most of them are the pale white small flowers on the edge of a dilapidated hell, which of course are not beautiful. But this hell must also be lost. This was told to me by the faces and tones of several heroes who were eloquent and ruthless but had not yet succeeded at that time. So I wrote 'The Lost Good Hell'." ("Wild Grass" English translation preface, November 1931). Here, "heroes who had not yet succeeded at that time" refers to the Kuomintang reactionary group in power after 1927. "The Lost Good Hell" uses a symbolic technique, but it can be seen that it refers to the inevitable collapse of the Northern Warlords, and at the same time predicts that the Chiang Kai-shek faction replacing the Northern Warlords would be worse than the Northern Warlords. Lu Xun's reserved attitude towards the revolutionary situation and leading figures on the eve of the 1927 Great Revolution can be said to be due to the fact that he was relatively calm and recognized the long-term and arduous nature of the Chinese revolution "due to the lessons of facts" (the failure of the Xinhai Revolution); but at the same time, it cannot be said that he did not have a clear belief in the newcomers who would inevitably come to overthrow the "hell" afterwards. His reserved attitude made him temporarily silent when he arrived in Guangzhou, the "revolutionary base" at that time, in 1927.

Although Lu Xun's time in Guangzhou was not long, it was very important in the development of his thought. Later, (in 1932) he summarized his ideological changes during that period and said: "I have always believed in the theory of evolution, and always thought that the future must be better than the past, and the youth must be better than the old... However, later I realized that I was wrong. It was not the theory of historical materialism or the works of revolutionary literature that bewitched me. In Guangdong, I witnessed the fact that the youth were divided into two major camps, either writing letters to inform or helping officials to arrest people! My thoughts were thus destroyed..." (Preface to "Sanxian Ji"). Lu Xun was not the kind of person: who just read some preliminary knowledge of historical materialism and dialectical materialism from books yesterday and then boasted today that he had mastered the world view of the proletariat. He despised such people. He deeply knew that when people who grew up in the old society, intellectuals from the landlord class, the bourgeoisie, and the petty bourgeoisie appeared as rebels of their own class, it did not mean that they had completely acquired the world view of the proletariat and that there were no remnants of feudal consciousness or bourgeois idealism in the depths of their souls; they could often be correct on one point and make mistakes on another, correct at one time and make mistakes at another. The reason why Lu Xun was able to recognize the long-term and arduous nature of self-ideological transformation better than his contemporaries was precisely because of his long-term personal experience. He often said, "Old habits are hard to forget"; he also said that although he often dissected others mercilessly, he dissected himself more often and more mercilessly. He did not believe that anyone in the world could transform from a non-working-class ideological consciousness to a working-class ideological consciousness overnight after listening to one or two lectures and reading one or two books. He thought that such "suddenly changed" intellectuals could not stand the test. In fact, he also witnessed many such "heroes" revealing their original form under a little wind and frost.

It was precisely because of the above-mentioned lessons of facts that Lu Xun saw that the setbacks of the 1927 revolution were different from the failure of the Xinhai Revolution. The self-ideological struggle of the "Wild Grass" period came to a conclusion. It was also because he had absorbed the lessons of facts in a long-term ideological struggle that the new belief he established after correcting his previous bias of only believing in the theory of evolution arose from the depths of his soul and was given the strength of his whole life; and it was precisely at the difficult juncture when the revolution suffered setbacks that he resolutely turned to communism and, under the leadership of the Communist Party, began a new, long-term, more arduous, and more courageous struggle.

	×　　×　　×

In August 1928, Lu Xun said the following in an open letter replying to readers: "I only hope that there are practical people who are willing to translate several books on historical materialism that have been well-received in the world – at least one simple and easy-to-understand book, two precise books – and also one or two opposing works. Then, when arguing, many words can be saved."

This year was the period when Lu Xun launched a debate with the Creation Society and the Sun Society, so Lu Xun's words were uttered with emotion. In these words, he mentioned "works that have been well-received in the world," but also mentioned "opposing works," which is very important. This precisely shows Lu Xun's spirit of seeking truth from facts in learning historical materialism and dialectical materialism. At that time, the systematic introduction and study of Marxist-Leninist classics can be said to have not yet begun. The Creation Society and the Sun Society first introduced the preliminary knowledge of Marxist literary theory, and emphasized that literature and art should serve the revolution, and writers should stand firm on the revolutionary position and express revolutionary struggles, etc., which played a significant role in the literary movement at that time, and all of these should be affirmed; however, there is no need to avoid the fact that they committed the mistake of dogmatism when using Marxism-Leninism to discuss the specific issues of the literary movement at that time. These specific issues include the issue of the subject matter of works, the issue of the unity of the ideological and artistic nature of works, the issue of the evaluation of progressive writers at that time, especially the issue of the evaluation of Lu Xun, and so on. When correctly solving these problems, one should consider the characteristics of the Chinese revolutionary situation at that time, the specific situation of progressive literature and reactionary literature in China at that time, and the strategy of the revolutionary literary movement in China at that time – the united front work of both criticism and unity; however, because the left-wing literary movement activists at that time were not good at combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolutionary struggle, they often liked to use the framework of dogma to force things when discussing the above-mentioned issues. Such a method was obviously not convincing, and some of the critical attitudes were very rude, which made people afraid. As for the "Proletarian Literature" works at that time, most of them were conceptualized and formulaic things. Lu Xun opposed these dogmatic literary criticisms and literary theories, and opposed the conceptualization and formulization of works. But Lu Xun was still in the process of learning historical materialism and dialectical materialism at that time (he later said that he thanked the Creation Society for launching a debate with him, because this "squeezed" him to read Marxist-Leninist classics), so in this debate, we cannot see him using the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint and method to propose systematic and comprehensive analysis and propositions on all the specific issues in the revolutionary literary movement at that time, as he did after 1930.

Opposing the "national essence" that clung to the old and stuck to the old, and also opposing the uncritical swallowing and regurgitation of foreign dogmas, was what Lu Xun had been vigorously advocating since the "May Fourth Movement," and this was still Lu Xun's basic idea in the 1928 debate, but because the debate at that time was mixed with personal issues and sectarian emotions, this basic point was not very prominent. However, this debate was of great significance to the development of the revolutionary literary movement; it was also helpful to the development of Lu Xun's own literary thought.

Lu Xun's proposition of opposing dogmatism became more thorough in his speech at the founding meeting of the League of Left-Wing Writers (March 1930). He said: "I think that in the present, 'left-wing' writers can easily become 'right-wing' writers. Why? First, if you don't contact the actual social struggle and just stay in the glass window to write articles and study problems, then no matter how intense and 'left' you are, it is easy to do; but when you encounter reality, you will immediately be shattered. Staying in the house makes it easiest to talk about thorough doctrines, but it also makes it easiest to be right-leaning." What is said here is that both "left" leaning and right-leaning are manifestations of dogmatism, and are the results of being divorced from the masses, not understanding the reality of the revolution, and holding on to a few dogmas. In another article, he also pointed out that the revolutionary writers and critics at that time "often cannot, or dare not, face the current society and know its details, especially think they know the details of the enemy." He said: "A fighter, I think, must go to dissect the current enemies more in understanding the revolution and the enemy." ("A Glimpse of Shanghai Literature and Art")

In order to overcome the formulization and conceptualization of literary works, Lu Xun at that time raised the issue of writers' having to be familiar with life. He thought that what writers wrote was not entirely their personal experience, but could also be empathy, "So to write about stealing, he does not have to be a thief himself, to write about adultery, he does not have to commit adultery himself. But I think this is because the writer grew up in the old society and is familiar with the situation of the old society and is accustomed to the characters of the old society, so he can empathize; he will be incompetent with the situation and characters of the proletariat with whom he has never had any relationship, or he will make wrong descriptions. Therefore, revolutionary writers, at least, must share their lives with the revolution, or deeply feel the pulse of the revolution." ("A Glimpse of Shanghai Literature and Art")

After 1932, Lu Xun's main works were so-called "essays." This was due to environmental constraints, and also due to the necessity of ideological struggle. His hundreds of "essays" can be said to encompass everything from ancient times to the present, reflecting the contradictions and struggles in the political, social, cultural, and academic aspects of that era. He made Marxist analyses of various issues and various phenomena with extremely imaginative and insightful writing. These "essays," each generally only a few hundred words, were, however, exquisite in their analysis and piercing to the bone; his laughter and scolding were not only a whip and a bloody mark, but also had lingering sounds that were worth pondering. These "essays" are not only highly combative political essays, but also pearls of art. The vast majority of these essays still have realistic significance today.

Lu Xun, a Marxist, in the last five years of his fighting life, made sharp and profound criticisms of the bourgeois idealistic thoughts that appeared in various forms at that time, and conducted Marxist-Leninist ideological education for the broad masses of young intellectuals. He refuted the super-class theory of the "New Moon School" of court scholars. He cited historical facts from China and abroad, from ancient and modern times, and also cited the actions of the "New Moon School" itself to prove that the "super-classists" are essentially running dogs of the oppressing class, who appear to be impartial, but in fact, thoroughly support all the freedoms enjoyed by the oppressing class, and do not allow the oppressed class to have the right to demand freedom and liberation.

When the so-called "third type of people" demanded "freedom of literature and art" and launched a debate, Lu Xun stripped off the disguise of the "third type of people," pointing out that the "third type of people" were actually the "first type of people." They did not protest against the Kuomintang reactionary government's prohibition of revolutionary literature, persecution of progressive writers, and other crimes, but pretended to have a wronged face, reversed black and white, and instead demanded "freedom of literature and art" from the oppressed progressive literary group (the then League of Left-Wing Writers). This was a complete act of spitting blood, and its attempt was to deceive inexperienced youth, and its effect was more sinister than the anti-Marxist and anti-realist clamor of the "New Moon School."

During this period, many of Lu Xun's essays continued to criticize the absurdity of "national essence" and "complete Westernization," with more incisive arguments than in the early period. In the early period, he still regarded these two issues from the perspective of the theory of evolution. Now, he regards them from the perspective of Marxism; these essays not only had a huge educational role at that time, but also have realistic significance today.

				×　　×　　×

From the "essays," one can get a glimpse of Lu Xun's erudition. If a catalog were compiled of the Chinese and foreign books from ancient and modern times that he quoted, it would be very long. However, he was completely different from those "citationists" who rely solely on quoting other people's remarks to cover up their own ideological poverty. The reason why he cited was sometimes to illustrate a point, but more often to refute the errors of those scholars who appeared to be erudite, had a "historical habit and textual research habit," or to expose the absurdity of those self-proclaimed "national scholars." When fighting against the new and old diehards (who all hung up the banner of protecting national culture and opposed various reform movements), Lu Xun's common tactic was "using your spear to attack your shield"; that is, quoting the words of ancient Chinese scholars to prove that the unique arguments that those new and old diehards boasted of were actually already in existence and had long been refuted by ancient scholars.

In order to prevent young people from burying themselves in old paper piles and escaping reality, Lu Xun ridiculed those "scholars" who claimed to have a "historical habit and textual research habit" in the first chapter of "The True Story of Ah Q" with hilarious writing. In many "essays," he sharply and relentlessly attacked those nationalists who deceived young people with various faces, pointing out that the "national essence" sold by this group of people was actually dross. In order to induce young people to strive to learn the advanced scientific and artistic knowledge of various countries in the world, in order to make young people "open their eyes to see the world," especially to oppose the then-reactionary restoration movement, he bluntly told young people: there is no benefit in reading thread-bound books!

It was precisely because Lu Xun had to fight against the new and old diehards and various reactionary forces who hung up the banner of national essence to anesthetize and deceive young people that he had to adopt the tactic of "correction must be excessive." His articles at that time mostly exposed dross (which was precisely what the self-proclaimed national scholars and nationalists with ulterior motives worshiped as the essence), and relatively few elucidated the excellent traditions. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique once took advantage of this loophole and falsely claimed that Lu Xun held a negative attitude towards national traditional culture, thereby spreading their own nihilistic fallacies about national culture, but these fallacies could not stand the refutation of facts. Lu Xun's high evaluation of Chinese literature throughout the ages can be seen in his "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction"; his evaluation of national sculpture, painting, music, and even the great thinkers in Chinese history is very fair, neither belittling himself nor blindly boasting. Lu Xun cherished all the elites in Chinese national culture. Only the feudal dross that hinders the survival and development of the Chinese nation did he deeply hate and abhor, and constantly gave it relentless exposure and criticism. He said the following in 1918:

	"A friend of mine said it well: 'If we want to preserve the national essence, the national essence must also be able to preserve us.'

	"Preserving us is indeed the first meaning. Just ask whether it has the power to preserve us, regardless of whether it is the national essence."

I think these few words can well summarize Lu Xun's attitude towards the national cultural heritage, and also conform to the Marxist principle towards the national cultural heritage.

Lu Xun's attitude towards the national cultural heritage is consistent with his attitude of advocating learning the advantages of other national cultures. Lu Xun advocated that it is necessary to learn from the advanced science and beautiful literature and art of all nations in the world, but he also repeatedly criticized those who blindly praised the things of European and American powers, regardless of good or bad, and worshiped foreign idols. He ruthlessly ridiculed those so-called "scholars" who held a foreign scholar as an idol and went everywhere to scare young people, because although the superficiality of this group of people can be forgiven, their misleading of young people cannot be forgiven.

Respecting and loving the excellent cultural traditions of all nations in the world and developing cultural exchanges and learning from each other is a good tradition of the Chinese people. Lu Xun has cited Chinese historical facts in many articles, pointing out that the Chinese people have developed cultural exchanges with neighboring nations since the Han Dynasty and have absorbed many foreign factors on the basis of their own cultural traditions for reference in order to enrich their own cultural content. He pointed out that the courage to absorb the elites of foreign excellent cultures often occurs in dynasties with political stability and economic development, such as the prosperous Han and Tang Dynasties, while the ruling class who lack self-confidence in the declining world often cling to the old and stick to the old and dare not contact foreign fresh things. In his short essay "On Bringing It Over," he loudly called out that anything that is beneficial to me, whether Chinese or foreign, ancient or modern, should be learned and absorbed to become my own flesh and blood. With this belief, he spent most of his energy introducing and translating foreign literature, art, and academics. The scope of his introduction was very wide, and he was particularly enthusiastic about introducing the literature of the Eastern European nations, which were still oppressed at that time. In the cultural exchange work between China and various countries in the world during that period, Lu Xun's contribution was outstanding, and its influence was also far-reaching.

Lu Xun's own works also prove that he was able to perfectly practice his theory. His novels and essays have unique styles. This style was formed precisely on the basis of the excellent traditions of Chinese literature, absorbing the essence of foreign excellent literature, and through his personal temperament. For Chinese literary works before Lu Xun, Lu Xun's works are completely new things that have never existed before, but at the same time, they are completely national, and are more national than those things that boast of national style in form.

In recent years, the work of studying Lu Xun has been quite successful. However, there are also shortcomings. Among them, the most alarming is the tendency of dogmatism in research work. This research method often does not specifically analyze Lu Xun's own writings, does not pay attention to the background materials (social and personal) in which these writings were produced, but subjectively assumes: something happened in a certain year and a certain month, and it must have had some influence on Lu Xun's thinking? Then look for evidence in Lu Xun's writings. Or: what kind of views did the masters of Marxism hold on a certain issue, and therefore, Lu Xun, a Marxist, could not have held other views; so he also looked for evidence in Lu Xun's writings. There have also been vulgar sociological views on the interpretation of Lu Xun's works. The most prominent example is that the "crow" at the end of "Medicine" must symbolize something, and therefore, various strange guesses have occurred. Attempting to find "subtle meanings in profound words" in Lu Xun's fragments has also become a hobby among some people. These biases are all detrimental to the correct development of Lu Xun's research work, and also detrimental to correctly learning from Lu Xun.

In order to better learn from Lu Xun, we must strengthen our research work. When studying Lu Xun's works, both its ideological and artistic aspects should be equally valued, and the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" should be implemented to make the research work more active and more in-depth.

We must inherit and carry forward Lu Xun's spirit, and more vigorously carry out cultural exchanges between the people of our country and the people of all countries in the world, learn from each other, and make more contributions to the cultural prosperity of mankind!

专栏：

    鲁迅——从革命民主主义到共产主义
    ——在首都的鲁迅逝世二十周年纪念大会上的报告
    茅盾
    鲁迅在1932年4月写的“二心集”（1930—31年两年间的杂文的结集）的序言，在回顾自己的思想发展的过程时，说了这样一句话：“只是原先是憎恶这熟识的本阶级，毫不可惜它的溃灭，后来又由于事实的教训，以为唯新兴的无产者才有将来”。鲁迅就以这样的信念，在中国共产党的思想领导之下，坚决为人民服务，坚决与各种嘴脸的反动势力斗争，鞠躬尽瘁，直到生命的最后一分钟。
    正像世人共知的其他许多伟大的文学家、思想家、社会活动家一样，——在这里，我想到了萧伯纳、罗曼·罗兰、德莱塞等等辉煌的名字，——鲁迅所走过的道路是漫长而崎岖的道路，不但充满了荆棘，而且有当道的豺狼，有窥伺在暗处的鬼蜮，也有戴髑髅而舞的狐狸。“朝发轫于苍梧兮，夕余至乎县圃；
    欲少留此灵琐兮，日忽忽其将暮。吾令羲和弭节兮，望崦嵫而勿迫；
    路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索。”
    1926年，鲁迅在小说集“彷徨”的卷头用了上面所引的屈原的诗句作为题词；这表示那时的他抱着我们古代哲人的“朝闻道，夕死可矣”的精神，一边战斗，一边追求真理。那时候，他的基本态度，可以从他后来对于“语丝”（1924年发刊的周刊，鲁迅和它的关系最久）的评价得到说明；他说“语丝”在不意中显了一种特色是：“任意而谈，无所顾忌，要催促新的产生，对于有害于新的旧物，则竭力加以排击，——但应该产生怎样的‘新’，却并无明白的表示，而一到觉得有些危害之际，也还是故意隐约其词。……所以隐约其词者，不过要使走狗嗅得，跑去献功时，必须详加说明，比较地费些力气，不能直捷痛快，就得好处而已。”
    这一段话，说明了同人杂志“语丝”的态度和进行战斗的方法。自然，“应该产生怎样的‘新’”，鲁迅当时并不是没有目标。但鲁迅之所以没有明白的表示，正因为他不肯以耳代目、在未有深刻的认识以前就有所表示，这和他“后来又由于事实的教训”而坚定其信念的精神，是一致的。
    我个人有这样的感想：如果把鲁迅和罗曼·罗兰相比较，很有相同之处。罗曼·罗兰七十岁时，曾经为了答谢苏联人民对他的庆祝说过这样的话：“多谢你们纪念我的七十岁，这好像是一个旅程的终点——从巴黎走到莫斯科。我已经走到了。这个旅程并不平顺，然而完结得很好。”罗曼·罗兰在解释他“是从什么地方，从什么时代的深处来的”，曾经沉痛地说他的童年和青年时代是一直在悲观主义的重压之下度过的。同样地，鲁迅也经验过“寂寞和空虚”的重压，而鲁迅的“旅程”好像比罗曼·罗兰的更为艰苦，因为他不但背负着三千年封建古国的“因袭的重担，肩住了黑暗的闸门”，而且他还得和近百年的半殖民地的社会所形成的“买办文化”作斗争。
    书香人家的子弟，幼诵孔孟之言，长习声光化电之学，从革命民主主义走到共产主义：鲁迅所走过的这样的道路，使我想起了我们的许多前辈先生。这是中国的爱国的知识分子经过事实的教训以后所选择的道路。在二十年代到三十年代，鲁迅是引导着万千青年知识分子走向战斗，走向这样的道路的旗手。

    我们古代的哲人曾说：惟“仁者”（革命的人道主义者）为能爱人，为能憎人。鲁迅就是这样的“仁者”，他维护“人”的尊严，他爱的是被侮辱者与被损害者，他憎恨的是剥削者和压迫者。这样的“仁者”也一定是伟大的爱国主义者；而在半封建、半殖民地的中国，伟大的爱国主义者也一定不能不是反帝国主义和反封建的战士。1930年以前鲁迅的中心思想和主要的活动，大概可以用这几句话来概括。
    1906年，在日本留学的鲁迅就开始了文学运动的计划。这是打算出版一种期刊，定名为“新生”。但这计划终于为了种种阻碍而没有实现。后来（1922年，“呐喊”序），他回顾这一时期，告诉我们：他之所以要提倡文艺运动，因为文艺善于改变人们的精神，而他之所以把改变精神作为第一要着，是由于认识到“凡是愚弱的国民，即使体格如何健全，如何茁壮，也只能做毫无意义的示众的材料和看客”。
    “只能做毫无意义的示众的材料和看客”
  ——这是鲁迅对于那时候的中国人民的命运的最
  沉痛的说法。为什么“只能做示众的材料和看客”呢？鲁迅从各方面来分析，揭露了问题的本质。
    他怀着无限沉痛的心情，从“狂人日记”开始，取材于“病态社会中不幸的人们”，尖锐而辛辣地指出封建思想和帝国主义文化侵略所造成的“国民性”的痼疾。“狂人日记”借了“狂人”的口说出了几千年的“礼教”——中国封建制度的思想体系——的吃人的本质；他的发狂，正是封建礼教迫害的结果。
    “药”的意义更为深远而痛切。“病态社会中不幸的人们”之一，求“药”以救生命，然而这所谓“什么痨病都包好”的“药”（人血馒头）不但和骗人的巫术一样，并且那据说是“灵效”根源的人血还是一个革命者的血，也就是为了“病态社会中不幸的人们”而献出来的血！在这里，鲁迅的悲愤是双重的。他既痛心于民众之受封建思想的毒害而未觉醒，也批评了当时（辛亥革命前夕）的革命运动之脱离了民众。后来鲁迅自己说明：“药”的意图道“因为那时（“五四”运动时期）的主将是不主张消极的”，而且也不愿将“自以为苦的寂寞，再来传染给也如我那年青时候似的正做着好梦的青年”，所以“不恤用了曲笔，在‘药’的瑜儿（被杀的革命者）的坟上平空添上一个花环”；这也就是说，“药”的深远的寄托不在于那个“花环”而在于表现在整篇的深刻的矛盾。鲁迅根据他自己目击的辛亥革命的失败经验，借“药”的故事指出了一个真理：革命思想如果不掌握群众，那么，先驱者的血恐怕只能被当作“人血馒头”的材料罢了；而要使群众接受革命思想，就先得打开他们思想上的枷锁，使他们睁开眼看，——用鲁迅自己的话，就是“揭出痛苦，引起疗救的注意”，就是“改变他们的精神”。
    “阿Q正传”就是在更大的规模、更深远的意义上，来揭露“国民性”的痼疾的。就经济地位而言，阿Q是个劳动人民，然而在阿Q身上，除了劳动人民的一些品性而外，还有不少的封建阶级的思想意识，而这些思想意识恰恰又成为阿Q的精神上的枷锁和麻醉剂；但即使这样，当中国发生了革命时，阿Q便做了革命党，然而又“不准革命”，终于被摇身一变的假革命的新贵们拿去作为“示众”的材料。这就不但是阿Q个人的悲剧，也是辛亥革命的悲剧。有人以为阿Q终于做革命党是不符合于阿Q的性格的。1926年，鲁迅在“阿Q正传的成因”里，曾经这样答复：“据我的意思，中国倘不革命，阿Q便不做，既然革命，就会做的。我的阿Q的命运，也只能如此，人格也恐怕并不是两个。……此后倘再有改革，我相信还会有阿Q似的革命党出现。我也很愿意如人们所说，我只写出了现在以前的或一时期，但我还恐怕我所看见的并非现代的前身，而是其后，或者竟是二三十年之后。”这最后几句话，暗指着当时就要到来的1927年的革命。鲁迅对于那一次革命是并不乐观的，甚至于悲观。这且留在下节再说。
    阿Q这典型，如果只作为雇农来看，阿Q的故事，如果只作为反映辛亥革命的失败来看，那就不能够说明它的复杂性和深刻性。在旧社会中，所谓“阿Q相”是普遍存在的；从“衮衮诸公”到“正人君子”（伪善者），知识分子，市民，乃至劳动人民，都是或多或少地有几分阿Q的“精神品质”。因为，所谓“阿Q相”者，其构成的因素不是别的，而正是阶级社会的剥削制度所产生的等级观念和自私自利的思想意识，再加上半封建、半殖民地的媚外成性的统治阶级的愚民政策。当“阿Q正传”在报上连续刊登的时候，有些“正人君子”（伪善者）和高贵的绅士们，惴惴不安，都以为是骂到了自己。他们这惴惴不安实在是有理由的，因为在阿Q这面镜子里正照出了他们的嘴脸。认真说来，即在今天的我们，怕也不敢完全肯定地说：阿Q这面镜子里没有自己的影子。即使只是淡淡的一个影子，也到底是影子呵！这是因为，社会制度虽然改变了，旧社会旧制度所产生的思想意识的残余，却不能够马上在人们脑子里消灭的。
    毋庸讳言，“阿Q正传”的画面是相当阴暗的，而且鲁迅所强调的国民性的痼疾，也不无偏颇之处，这就是忽视了中国人民品性上的优点。这虽然可以用“良药苦口而利于病”来解释，但也和鲁迅当时对于历史的认识有关系。鲁迅曾经在另一篇文章中引用他的一个朋友的话而表示同情：历史上中国人只有做稳了奴隶和求为奴隶而不得这样两个时代。这显然对于中国历史上人民的作用，估计太低了。但说这样话时的鲁迅，有的是愤激，是苦闷，而绝不是消沉。正如他在“野草”中所表现的内心思想一样，尽管有矛盾，苦闷，而并不消沉。他还是坚决地战斗着，同时也不懈不怠地追求着真理。这正是鲁迅之所以成其伟大。
        ×　　×　　×
    鲁迅那时候的苦闷，——用他自己所常用的字句，就是空虚和寂寞之感，——和“五四”以前（1911—18这段时间）他所深以为痛苦的一天一天的长大起来，如大毒蛇，缠住了他的灵魂的“寂寞”，性质上有相同之处，而也有不同之处。相同之处，在于他把“五四”运动右翼分子的日趋反动，以及本来反对“五四”运动的人们那时也挂羊头卖狗肉，企图篡夺领导权等等这些事实，和他所目击的辛亥革命时期的败象，加以比较，因而痛切地感到“世道仍然如此”的悲哀。（他在“阿Q正传”中描写赵秀才、假洋人之类的乘机“革命”，“咸与维新”，和不准阿Q革命，笔锋所指，也向着“五四”以后那班投机家。）而不同之处，则在于他也目击着或至少感觉到动荡的时代中有一股顽强的潜流，“好像压于大石之下的萌芽一样，在曲折地滋长”，在于他自己的思想中除了素所信奉的进化论以外，又“挤”进了新的东西——阶级斗争的理论以及第一个社会主义国家的出现。这不同之处，标示了鲁迅思想的发展。而反映了他的这一时期的思想斗争和愤激的情绪的，便是“野草”（散文诗，二十多篇，1924—26年作于北京）。后来（1931年），他自己对于“野草”作了这样的说明：“这也可以说，大半是废弛的地狱边沿的惨白色小花，当然不会美丽。但这地狱也必须失掉。这是由几个有雄辩和辣手，而那时还未得志的英雄们的脸色和语气所告诉我的。我于是作‘失掉的好地狱’。”（“野草”英文译本序，1931年11月）。这里，“那时还未得志的英雄们”是指1927年以后当权的国民党反动集团。“失掉的好地狱”用的是象征的手法，但可以看出，这里指的是北洋军阀的必然倒台，而同时预言了代替北洋军阀的蒋介石派会比北洋军阀更坏。鲁迅对于1927年大革命前夕的革命形势和风云人物所采取的保留态度，可以说是他“由于事实的教训”（辛亥革命的失败）故而头脑比较冷静，认识到中国革命的长期性和艰苦性；但同时，也不能不说，他那时对于此后必然要来打倒“地狱”的新人，还没有明确的信念。他的这种保留态度，使他在1927年到了当时“革命策源地”广州的时候，暂时沉默起来。
    鲁迅在广州的时间虽然不长，但在他的思想发展上，却很重要。后来，（1932年）他总括那一时期的自己的思想变化，说：“我一向是相信进化论的，总以为将来必胜于过去，青年必胜于老人……然而后来我明白我倒是错了。这并非唯物史观的理论或革命文艺的作品蛊惑我的，我在广东，就目睹了同是青年，而分成两大阵营，或则投书告密，或则助官捕人的事实！我的思路因此轰毁……”（“三闲集”序言）。鲁迅不是那样的人：昨天刚从书本上读到了一点历史唯物主义和辩证唯物主义的初步知识，今天便自诩为已经掌握了无产阶级的世界观。他鄙薄那样的人。他深切地知道生长于旧社会的人，出身于地主阶级、资产阶级和小资产阶级的知识分子，当其作为本阶级的叛逆者出现的时候，并不等于已经完全获得无产阶级的世界观，灵魂深处已经没有封建意识或资产阶级唯心主义的残余；他们常常可能在某一点上正确而在别一点上犯错误，在某一时期正确而在另一时期犯错误。而鲁迅之所以比他同时代的人更能认识到自我思想改造的长期性和艰苦性，也正由于他亲身的长期体验。他常常说，“积习难忘”；又说，他虽然经常无情地解剖别人，但更经常更无情地解剖自己。他不信世界上有人能于旦夕之间，听过一二次讲演、看过一二本书，就从非工人阶级的思想意识转变为工人阶级的思想意识。他以为这样“突变”了的知识分子是经不起考验的。而事实上，他也目睹了不少这样的“英雄”在小小风霜之下就现了原形。
    正是由于上述的种种事实教训，鲁迅看清了1927年革命的挫折不同于辛亥革命的失败。“野草”时期的自我思想斗争得到了结论。也正因为在长期的思想斗争中吸取了事实的教训，他在纠正了自己以前的只信进化论的偏颇以后建立起来的新信仰，是从心灵深处发生的，是付给了全生命的力量的；而且正是在革命遭受挫折的困难关头，他坚决地走向共产主义，在共产党领导之下，开始了新的、长期的、更艰苦更勇猛的战斗。
        ×　　×　　×
    1928年8月，鲁迅在答复读者的公开信中，有这样的话：“我只希望有切实的人，肯译几部世界上已有定评的关于唯物史观的书——至少，是一部简单浅显的，两部精密的——还要一两本反对的著作。那么，论争起来，可以省说许多话。”
    这一年，正是鲁迅和创造社、太阳社展开了论争的时期，因而鲁迅这几句话，是有感而发的。在这些话里，提到“世界上已有定评的著作”，但也提到了“反对的著作”，这很重要。这正表现了鲁迅对于学习历史唯物主义和辩证唯物主义的实事求是的精神。在那时候，有系统地介绍和研究马克思列宁主义的经典著作，可以说还没有开始，创造社和太阳社首先介绍了马克思主义文艺理论的初步知识，并且强调了文艺应当为革命服务，作家应当站定革命的立场，表现革命斗争等等，对于当时的文学运动起了重大的作用，这都是应当肯定的；然而毋庸讳言，它们在运用马克思列宁主义来讨论当时文学运动的具体问题时，却犯了教条主义的错误。这些具体问题，就是作品的题材问题，作品的思想性与艺术性统一的问题，对于当时的进步作家的评价问题，特别是对于鲁迅的评价问题等等。正确地解决这些问题时，就应当考虑到当时中国革命形势的特点，当时中国进步文学与反动文学的具体情况，以及当时中国革命文学运动的战略——又批评又团结的统一战线工作；但由于当时的左翼文学运动者还不善于把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命斗争的具体实践相结合，因而在讨论上述问题时，每每喜欢用教条的框子来硬套。这样的办法，显然是不能说服人的，而且有些批评的态度十分粗暴，又使人望而生畏。至于当时的“普罗文学”作品，则极大部分是概念化、公式化的东西。鲁迅反对这些教条主义的文学批评和文学理论，反对作品的概念化、公式化。但鲁迅在那时候也还是正在开始学习历史唯物主义和辩证唯物主义（他后来说，他感谢创造社对他展开的争论，因为这“挤”他阅读马克思列宁主义经典著作），因而在这次论争中，我们还不能看到他运用马克思列宁主义的观点和方法对于当时革命文学运动中所有的具体问题提出有系统的和全面的分析和主张，像他在1930年以后那样。
    反对抱残守缺、故步自封的“国粹主义”，同时也反对生吞活剥、搬弄洋教条，这是“五四”以后鲁迅所极力主张的，这也仍然是1928年论争中鲁迅的基本思想，但因当时的论争夹杂着个人问题和宗派情绪，因而这一基本论点就不很突出。可是这一次论争，对于革命文学运动的开展，是有重大的意义的；对于鲁迅自己的文艺思想的发展，也是有帮助的。
    鲁迅的反对教条主义的主张，在左翼作家联盟成立大会（1930年3月）的讲话中，就更透彻了。他说：“我以为在现在，‘左翼’作家是很容易成为‘右翼’作家的。为什么呢？第一，倘若不和实际的社会斗争接触，单关在玻璃窗内做文章，研究问题，那是无论怎样的激烈，‘左’，都是容易办到的；然而一碰到实际，便即刻要撞碎了。关在房子里，最容易高谈彻底的主义，然而也最容易右倾。”这里说的是：“左”倾和右倾，都是教条主义的表现，都是脱离群众、不了解革命的实际、抱住几句教条的结果。在另一篇文章中，他又指出了当时的革命作家和批评家“也往往不能，或不敢正视现社会，知道它的底细，尤其是认为敌人的底细”。他说：“一个战斗者，我以为在了解革命和敌人上，倒是必须更多的去解剖当前的敌人的。”（“上海文艺之一瞥”）
    为了克服文学作品的公式化和概念化，鲁迅在那时就提出了作家必须熟悉生活的问题。他以为作家所写的，不尽是亲身的经验，也可以有体察，“所以要写偷，他不必亲自去做贼，要写通奸，他不必亲自去私通。但我以为这是因为作家生长在旧社会里，熟悉了旧社会的情形，看惯了旧社会的人物的缘故，所以他能够体察；对于和他向来没有关系的无产阶级的情形和人物，他就会无能，或者弄成错误的描写了。所以革命文学家，至少是必须和革命共同着生命，或深切地感受着革命的脉搏的。”（“上海文艺之一瞥”）
    1932年后，鲁迅的主要作品是所谓“杂文”。这是由于环境所迫，也由于思想斗争的必要。他的几百篇“杂文”，可以说是上下古今，包罗万象，反映了那个时代的政治、社会、文化、学术等等方面的矛盾和斗争。他以极其富有形象性的、深入浅出的笔墨，对各种问题和各种现象，作了马克思主义的分析。这些“杂文”，每篇大抵不过数百字，然而析理精微，剸刺入骨；嘻笑唾骂，既一鞭一血痕，亦且余音悠然，耐人咀嚼。这些“杂文”，不仅是战斗性极强的政论，也是艺苑的珍珠。这些杂文，绝大多数，在今天也还有现实意味。
    马克思主义者的鲁迅，在他的战斗生活的最后五年中，对当时的以各种形式出现的资产阶级唯心主义思想，作了尖锐深刻的批判，对广大青年知识分子进行了马克思列宁主义的思想教育。他驳斥了御用学者“新月派”的超阶级论。他引证中外古今的历史事实，也引证“新月派”本身的行动，来证明“超阶级论者”实质上是压迫阶级的走狗，他们貌似公正，实际上是彻头彻尾拥护压迫阶级所享有的一切自由，而不许被压迫阶级有要求自由、解放的权利。
    在所谓“第三种人”要求“文艺自由”而展开论战的时候，鲁迅剥下了“第三种人”的伪装，指出“第三种人”实在是“第一种人”，他们不向国民党反动政府的禁止革命文学、迫害进步作家等等罪恶表示抗议，却装出了受委曲的嘴脸，颠倒黑白，反而向被压迫的进步文学集团（当时的左联）要求给以“文艺自由”，这是十足的含血喷人的勾当，其企图是要欺骗缺少经验的青年，其作用比“新月派”的反马克思主义和反现实主义的叫嚣更为阴险。
    在这个时期，鲁迅的许多杂文对于“国粹主义”和“全盘欧化论”的荒谬，都继续加以批判，比前期的议论更为精辟。在前期，他还是以进化论的观点来看待这两个问题，现在呢，他是以马克思主义的观点来看待了；他的这些杂文不但在当时有巨大的教育作用，在今天也还有现实的意义。
                ×　　×　　×
    从“杂文”中，可以窥见鲁迅的学问的渊博。如果把他引用过的中外古今的书籍编一个目录，将是很长。但是他和那些专靠引用别人言论来掩饰自己思想贫乏的“文引家”是完全不同的。他之所以征引，有时是为了说明一个论点，但更多的是为了驳斥那些“有历史癖和考据癖”的貌似渊博的炫学家的错误，或者为了揭露那些自封的“国学家”的荒谬。在和新、旧顽固派（他们都挂起保护民族文化的招牌，反对各种革新运动）作斗争的时候，鲁迅常用的战术是“以子之矛，攻子之盾”；这就是引用中国古代学者的话，来证明那些新、旧顽固派自诩为独特的议论实在是早已有之而且是早已为古代学者所驳斥过的。
    为了反对青年们埋头故纸堆中，逃避现实，鲁迅在“阿Q正传”的第一章中就以令人喷饭的妙笔嘲笑了那些自称有“历史癖和考据癖”的“学者”。在许多“杂文”中，他尖锐地穷追不舍地抨击那些以各种面目欺骗青年的国粹主义者，他指出了这班人所叫卖的“国粹”其实是糟粕。为了诱导青年努力学习世界各国先进的科学和文艺知识，为了使得青年们“睁眼看世界”，特别是反对那时候反动派的复古运动，他干脆地告诉青年：读线装书没有益处！
    正因为鲁迅必须和挂着国粹招牌来麻醉、欺骗青年的新、旧顽固派、各种反动势力作斗争，所以他不能不采用“矫枉必须过正”的战术。他那时的文章，揭露糟粕（这正是自封的国学家以及别有用心的国粹主义者所崇奉为精华的）者多，而阐明优秀传统的比较少。胡风反革命派曾经钻这空子，诬称鲁迅对于民族传统文化是抱否定态度的，从而散播他们自己的对于民族文化的虚无主义的谬论，但这些谬论是经不起事实的驳斥的。鲁迅对于中国历代文学的高度的评价，见于他的“中国小说史略”；对于民族的雕刻、绘画、音乐，乃至中国历史上的伟大的思想家，他的评价都是十分公允的，既不妄自菲薄，也不盲目自夸。凡是中国民族文化中的精英，鲁迅无不宝爱。唯有那阻碍中国民族生存和发展的封建主义的糟粕，他这才深恶而痛绝之，不断地给以无情的揭露和抨击。他在1918年就说过这样的话：
    “我有一位朋友说得好：‘要我们保存国粹，也须国粹能保存我们。’
    “保存我们，的确是第一义。只要问它有无保存我们的力量，不管它是否
    国粹。”
    这几句话，我以为很可以概括鲁迅对于民族文化遗产的态度，也符合于马克思主义者对于民族文化遗产的原则。
    鲁迅对于民族文化遗产的态度，和他提倡学习其它民族文化的优点的态度，是一致的。鲁迅主张必须向世界各民族先进的科学和优美的文艺学习，但也屡次批评那些不问好歹，只要是欧美大国的东西就瞎眼吹捧的那些崇拜洋偶像的作法。他毫不留情地嘲笑那些捧着一个外国学者作为偶像到处去吓唬青年的所谓“学者”，因为这班人的浅薄虽然还可以原谅，而他们的贻误青年则是不可宽恕的。
    尊重并热爱世界各民族的优秀的文化传统，并且发展文化交流，互相学习，这是中国人民的良好的传统。鲁迅在许多文章中，都曾引证中国历史事实，指出中国人民自汉朝开始就和邻近各民族发展了文化交流，并在本国文化传统的基础上，吸收了不少的外来的因素，以为借鉴，以丰富自己的文化内容。他指出：勇于吸收外国的优秀文化的精英，常常发生在政治稳定、经济发展的王朝，如汉唐盛世，而浇薄季世的失了自信力的统治阶级则往往抱残守缺，故步自封，不敢接触外来的新鲜事物。他在“拿来主义”这篇短文中，大声号召，凡是有益于我的东西，无论中外古今，都应该学习，都应该吸收使成为自己的血肉。在这样的信念上，他曾以大部分的精力，介绍和翻译外国的文艺和学术。他介绍的范围很广，尤其热心于介绍那时还是被压迫的东欧各民族的文学。在那个时期的中国与世界各国的文化交流工作中，鲁迅的贡献是卓越的，而它的影响也是深远的。
    鲁迅自己的作品也证明了他是能够十分完善地实践他的理论的。他的小说和论文，都有独特的风格。这风格，正是在中国文学的优秀传统的基础上，吸收了外国的优秀文学的精华，通过他个人的气质而形成的。对鲁迅以前的中国文学作品而言，鲁迅的作品是从前未有的完全新的东西，但同时又完全是民族的，比那些在形式上自诩是民族风格的东西是更为民族些的。

    近几年来，研究鲁迅的工作，颇有成就。然而也有缺点。其中最应当引起我们警惕的，是研究工作中的教条主义倾向。这种研究方法往往不从鲁迅著作本身去具体地分析，不注意这些著作产生的背景材料（社会的和个人的），而主观地这样设想：某年某月发生某事，对于鲁迅思想不能没有某些影响罢？然后在鲁迅著作中去找证据。或者是：马克思主义的大师们对于某一问题抱着怎样的见解，因而，马克思主义者的鲁迅也不可能抱着另外的见解；于是也在鲁迅著作中找证据。对于鲁迅作品的解释，也曾有过庸俗社会学的观点，最突出的例子是认为“药”的结尾处的“乌鸦”必有所象征，因而发生了种种奇怪的猜测。企图在鲁迅的片言只语中找寻“微言大义”，在某些人中，也成为一种癖好。这一些偏向，都有害于鲁迅研究工作的正确开展，也有害于正确地学习鲁迅。
    为了更好地向鲁迅学习，我们必须加强我们的研究工作。在研究鲁迅著作时，它的思想性和艺术性两个方面，应当同样重视，而且要贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，使得研究工作更加活跃，更加深入。
    我们要继承和发扬鲁迅的精神，更大力地开展我国人民和世界各国人民之间的文化交流，相互学习，为人类的文化繁荣作出更多的贡献！
