    The Tradition of Close Integration of Agricultural and Sideline Production Should Be Maintained
    Jin Xiang
    Currently, I have returned to Yangzhou Special District, Jiangsu Province, for a visit. The grain-producing area of Yangzhou consists of four counties with a population of more than 2 million people, covering a cultivated area of more than 3.3 million mu, with an average of 1.6 mu per person. Sparse land and a dense population are characteristics of this area. This region primarily cultivates coarse grains, including: barley, naked barley, wheat, broad beans, peas in the first harvest; soybeans, sorghum, corn, millet, peanuts, sweet potatoes, buckwheat, radishes, mixed beans...etc. in the second harvest.
    Generally speaking, the rural production level in this region is still lower than the highest level before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and in some cases, even lower than before Liberation. This is an issue that deserves serious attention.
    From the agricultural perspective, although grain yield has slightly increased since Liberation compared to before, it has not reached the pre-War of Resistance Against Japan level. According to a survey of three teams (best, average, worst) in three cooperatives in Taixing County, they produced 531,000 jin of grain in 1936, only 448,000 jin in 1953, and only 410,000 jin in 1955.
    In grain-producing areas, due to limited land and a large population, sideline income generally accounts for 50% to 60% of farmers' total income. In Taixing County, income from pig raising, oil pressing, and winemaking accounts for 60% of farmers' income, with pigs alone accounting for 33% to 44%, or even more than 50%. However, the current sideline situation is far from what it used to be. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the maximum annual pig production in Taixing County was over 900,000 heads. In 1949, 300,000 pigs were produced, more than 450,000 in 1950, more than 500,000 in 1951, and 520,000 in 1952 (some say 630,000), but in 1953, it dropped to 370,000, 450,000 in 1954, and 330,000 in 1955. In 1956, sideline development was vigorously promoted, reaching 410,000 heads in the summer, but this is still more than half less than the highest annual output before the War of Resistance Against Japan. The quality of pigs is also far from what it used to be. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, most pigs sold were generally grade 3 or grade 2, weighing 190 to 225 jin each. Now, most are grade 5, weighing only about 137 jin each, with thin meat and little fat. As for the people's production of oil and wine, it has also greatly decreased compared to the past. For example, the number of distilleries in Taixing County was 1,016 in 1951, but only 63 remained in 1955; the number of oil mills was 1,301 in 1951, but only 371 in 1954. This time, I returned to Ruanjiatang, Kunping Township, Daqiao District, Jiangdu, where I worked fourteen years ago. The masses complained about the difficulty of raising pigs and asked the government for help. In the past, every one of the twenty households in this village raised pigs, with some raising three or four heads, but this year, there are only four heads in the entire village.
    Why has rural production not been able to quickly catch up with and surpass the highest pre-war level? There are several reasons:
    Before Liberation, farmers suffered from enemy plunder, and some farmers' resources were depleted. After Liberation, this area often suffered from natural disasters. In the Henan area of Jiangdu, for example, there have been continuous disasters in the past five years: cold waves in 1952, hailstorms in 1953, floods in 1954, drought in 1955, and rainlogging and typhoons in 1956. After Liberation, insect pests have also developed, such as the bean weevil, which harms soybeans, and the leafminer, which harms broad beans, which did not exist before the War of Resistance Against Japan. However, it is worth noting that the original relationship between agriculture and sideline occupations has been weakened or destroyed. This is one of the important reasons why the production level in grain-producing areas has not increased rapidly.
    For a long time, this grain-producing area has formed an agricultural and sideline combination suitable for its local conditions. In the past, the masses did this: they processed the main grains produced in the fields (beans, peanuts, sorghum, barley, wheat, naked barley, etc.) through the local "Five Workshops." The so-called "Five Workshops" are: oil mills (for pressing soybean and peanut oil), distilleries (for brewing barley and sorghum into wine), flour mills (for grinding wheat and naked barley), starch mills (for grinding mixed beans into starch), and tofu workshops (for grinding soybeans into tofu). The by-products of the "Five Workshops" (bean cakes, peanut cakes, distiller's grains, barley heads, wheat bran, tofu dregs, starch dregs, etc.) plus barley, supplemented with pig feed, are very suitable for raising pigs. Fattened pigs can be sold for money, and pig manure and bean cakes can fertilize the fields and increase grain production. In this way, the "Five Workshops" → pig raising → grain production, the three circulate continuously, with agriculture and sideline occupations complementing each other and promoting each other.
    After the state's unified purchase and sale of grain, this flexible combination of agriculture and sideline occupations was greatly weakened. The state controls the raw materials for grain and oil, and processes them centrally. Most of the private "Five Workshops" were closed, resulting in difficulties in pig feed, and the masses greatly reduced pig raising. What followed was: the fields lacked pig manure, bean cakes, and peanut cakes. As a result, the income from pig raising was reduced, and the harvests in the fields were also poor.
    From this, it can be seen that grain, the "Five Workshops," and pigs are inseparable components of rural production in this area in the past. Among them, the pig raising problem is the key to the current production problem. The manure from each pig in Liuqiao Agricultural Cooperative can fertilize an average of 1.6 mu of land. This year, wheat yields 253 jin per mu, barley 263 jin, naked barley 251 jin, and each person averages 250 jin of wheat. The manure from each pig in Dalongwang Cooperative can fertilize an average of 3.06 mu. This year, wheat yields 136 jin per mu, naked barley 142 jin, barley 181 jin, and each member averages 110 jin of wheat. From these two examples, it can be seen how great the difference in farmland yield is depending on the amount of pig manure. The money earned from raising pigs, in addition to supplementing life, can be used to buy piglets, buy feed, and buy some fertilizer. Taking Taixing as an example, since the number of pigs raised in 1955 was less than the number raised before the War of Resistance Against Japan, each person earned more than 23 yuan less per year (based on the price of grade 5 pigs). Compared to 1951, each person earned 9.1 yuan less in 1955.
    In recent years, what difficulties have been encountered in pig raising?
    The first is the feed problem. With the closure of the "Five Workshops," there is no timely and local supply of feed. The feed supplied by state-owned commercial departments is small in quantity, poor in quality, expensive, and delayed. Currently, only 150 jin of barley are supplied per pig. According to farmers, if each pig is raised to 135 jin, it needs 300 jin of fine feed barley; to 150 jin, it needs 350 jin of fine feed barley; and to 200 jin (grade 2), it needs 400 jin of fine feed barley. The quality of the feed is now low. For example, wheat bran used to produce 68 jin of flour and 20 jin of bran from 100 jin of wheat. The bran had a flour content of 7.8%; now it produces 84 jin of flour and 14 jin of bran, and the bran has a flour content of only slightly less than 3%, so naturally the nutrition is poor. In the past, 100 jin of grain produced 61 to 65 jin of rice, but now it produces 72 to 73 jin, the bran is less and of poor quality, and the pigs have difficulty defecating after eating it. The quality of bean cake has also been greatly reduced. In the past, the oil content was 7%-10%, but now it is only 3%-4%, and it cannot be cut with a knife. Not only is the quality of the feed poor, but the price is also expensive. Bran costs 4.8 fen per jin (up to 5.5 fen), while the purchase price of barley is only 6.6 fen per jin, and 1 jin of barley can be exchanged for 1.375 jin of bran. Rice bran costs 4.5 fen per jin, while rice is only 7 fen per jin. In the past, 100 jin of beans could be exchanged for 157 jin of bean cake, but now 100 jin can only be exchanged for 123 jin. Moreover, the supply is not timely. In addition, because farmers have less grain left for their own consumption, in some places, barley is left for people to eat and not given to pigs.
    The second is the capital problem. Many members of the cooperative now do not have money to buy piglets. According to a typical survey in Taixing County, 40% of farmers lack funds for pig raising. Some bought piglets but did not have the capital to fatten them, and sold them when they reached grade 5. The bank's pig raising loans are small, about 10 yuan per pig in Taixing, which is only enough to buy piglets, making it difficult to raise them to maturity. According to bank materials, one household raised two pigs and borrowed a total of 43 yuan, and then sold them for 107 yuan after fattening them. This shows that loans can help farmers increase their income.
    The third is that pig raising is not very cost-effective. Piglets are expensive, costing 6, 7, or even 1 yuan per jin. A piglet costs about 10 yuan. Lean pigs sell for only 3 jiao per jin (grade 6), and a lean pig weighing about 115 jin sells for 34 yuan. The price of fat pigs is low. Although it has been raised a little recently, it may still be a bit low. In some places, the cooperative gives members a low price for manure fertilizer, and members do not get cash. In the past, farmers raised pigs to fertilize their own fields, so they were highly motivated to raise pigs. Now that the fields have been entered into the cooperative, piglets are expensive, fat pigs are cheap, manure fertilizer is cheap, and they cannot get cash. How can this not hinder the farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs?
    Due to the closure of the "Five Workshops," the reduction of pigs, and the low yields in the fields, the original relationship between agriculture and sideline occupations has been weakened. Although we have put a lot of effort into agriculture, and although the overall agricultural economy is constantly rising, due to the small amount of land and the large population, members cannot effectively increase their income by relying solely on farming.
    This year's wheat production has decreased, and the autumn crops are estimated to be only at the normal level. It is questionable whether the total income can be increased. Therefore, members are emotionally unstable. Those with the means leave, and some complain about the cooperative, waiting for the cooperative cadres to make a decision. In addition to strengthening political work, it is essential to consolidate the cooperative economically. And to consolidate the cooperative economically, we cannot deviate from the original foundation of the integration of agriculture and sideline occupations.
    I believe that if, under the guidance of the state's planned economy and on the basis of agricultural cooperativization, we develop the rural economy based on the local original laws of agricultural and sideline combinations, we can enable agricultural production in this region to catch up with and surpass the highest level before the War of Resistance Against Japan, improve the lives of farmers, consolidate cooperatives, and supply the state with more agricultural and sideline products.
      The central link is to mobilize the masses to raise pigs in large numbers with the support of the state. In addition to mobilizing the masses to collect more substitute feeds and expand the area of high-yield crops, it is very necessary for the government to increase the supply of feed and rationally supply farmers with food rations.
    The second is to appropriately open the "Five Workshops." Is it possible to leave more peanut, soybean and other oil crops to local people for self-pressing in key pig-producing areas? Is it possible to restore some oil workshops in the society as a unit, and sell the pressed oil to the state? Or entrust the cooperative to process by the state. If the masses process it themselves, the price of bean cake and peanut cake will be cheaper than the state processing, which can reduce the cost of raising pigs. If peanuts are processed by the society, the state will only purchase a part of the peanut kernels, and the rest will be used to purchase peanut oil. Can the task of distillery processing (wine making) also be increased appropriately? Can the development of flour mills, grinding mills and tofu workshops be developed according to needs?
    The third is to increase pig raising loans. Poor farmers can borrow 15 to 20 yuan to raise a pig. At the same time, we can also expand pre-purchase, and give some money (8-10 yuan) or grain first when the pig is raised to a medium-sized pig to help members raise the pig to be strong.
    In terms of price policy, the purchase price of strong pigs should be increased. In order to encourage members to send manure to the cooperative, the manure fertilizer should be reasonably priced.
    Combine agricultural production plans to formulate pig production plans. Pay attention to epidemic prevention work (more than 105,000 pigs died in Taixing in four years due to insufficient epidemic prevention work).

    农副业生产密切结合的传统应当保持
    金湘
    目前，我回到江苏省扬州专区访问。扬州的杂粮产区有四个县、二百多万人口，耕地面积有三百三十多万亩，每人平均一·六亩多。地少人多，是此地特点。这个地区以种植杂粮为主，上熟有：大麦、元麦、小麦、蚕豆、豌豆；下熟有：黄豆、高粱、玉米、粟子、花生、甘薯、荞麦、萝卜、杂豆……等。
    总的说来，这个地区的农村生产水平还不及抗日战争以前的最高水平，有的还不及解放以前，这是一个值得十分注意的问题。
    从农业方面看来，虽然解放以后，粮食产量比解放以前略有增加，但是没有达到抗日战争前水平。根据泰兴县三个社的三个队（最好的、一般的、最差的）的调查，1936年共产粮五十三万一千斤，1953年，只产粮食四十四万八千斤，1955年只产粮四十一万斤。
    在杂粮地区，由于田少人多，副业收入一般要占农民总收入的50％到60％。泰兴县农民的收入中，养猪、榨油、酿酒的收入占60％，仅猪一项就占33％到44％，以至50％以上。但是，现在副业情况远不如前。泰兴县抗日战争前每年最高养猪量九十多万头。1949年产猪三十多万头，1950年产四十五万多头，1951年五十多万头，1952年五十二万头（一说六十三万头），但1953年又下跌到三十七万头，1954年四十五万头，1955年三十三万头。1956年大力提倡发展副业，在夏季已达四十一万头，但比起抗日战争前的最高年产量少了一半多。猪的质量也远不如前。抗日战争以前，人们卖出的猪一般是三等和二等的多，每头重一百九十斤到二百二十五斤，现在是五等的多，每头只有一百三十七斤左右，肉薄油少。至于群众的油、酒生产，比过去也大大减少。如泰兴县酿酒的糟坊在1951年还有一千零十六户，1955年只剩下六十三户；油坊，1951年有一千三百○一户，1954年只有三百七十一户。这次，我回到十四年前工作过的地方——江都大桥区坤平乡阮家塘，群众纷纷诉说养猪困难，要求政府帮助解决。过去此庄二十户人家，家家养猪，多的一家养三、四头，今年全庄一共才只有四头。
    为什么农村生产没能很快地赶上和超过战前最高水平呢？原因有以下几点：
    解放以前，农民遭受敌人的掠夺，一些农民的底子枯了。解放以后，这一带时常遭受自然灾害，像江都河南地区，五年来，连续有灾害：1952年是寒流，1953年冰雹，1954年洪水，1955年干旱，1956年雨涝和台风。解放以后，虫害亦有发展，如危害大豆的关仓虫，危害蚕豆的潜叶虫，为抗日战争前所没有。但是，值得注意的是：原有的农副业结合关系被削弱或破坏了。这是杂粮产区生产水平提高不快的重要原因之一。
    这个杂粮地区长期以来形成了一种适合自己本地情况的农副业结合。过去群众的做法是这样：把田里产的主要粮食（豆类、花生、高粱、大麦、小麦、元麦等）通过本地开设的“五坊”自行加工。所谓“五坊”是：油坊（榨黄豆和花生油），糟坊（酿大麦、高粱为酒）、磨坊
  （磨小麦、元麦）、粉坊（磨杂豆做粉）、豆腐坊（磨黄豆为豆腐）。“五坊”的副产物（豆饼、花生饼、酒糟、大麦头、麦麸，豆腐渣、粉渣等）加上大麦，辅以猪草，用来养猪，非常合适。养肥的猪可卖钱，猪粪和豆饼可以肥田，增产杂粮。这样，“五坊”→养猪→杂粮生产，三者循环不息，农业副业相辅相成互相推动。
    粮食统购统销以后，这种灵活的农副业结合被大大削弱了。粮食和油料的原料由国家掌握，集中加工。民间的“五坊”大部关闭，因而猪的饲料发生困难，群众大大紧缩养猪。跟着来的是：田里缺乏猪粪和豆饼、花生饼。结果，养猪的收入既少了，田里收成也差了。
    由此可知：杂粮、“五坊”、猪三项是过去此地农村生产不可分割的内容。其中，养猪问题是目前生产问题的关键。刘乔农业社每头猪的粪平均要上1.6亩田，今年小麦每亩产二百五十三斤，大麦二百六十三斤，元麦二百五十一斤，每人平均分麦二百五十斤。大龙王社每头猪粪平均要上三·○六亩，小麦今年亩产一百三十六斤，元麦一百四十二斤，大麦一百八十一斤，社员每人平均分麦一百一十斤。从这两个例子可以看出：猪粪多或少的农田产量差别有多大。养猪赚的钱，除补助生活外，可以再买小猪，买饲料，可以买部分肥料。以泰兴为例，由于1955年养猪数比抗日战争前的养猪数减少，每人每年少收入二十三元多（以五等猪价为准），以1955年比1951年，每人少收入九·一元。
    近几年来，养猪碰到哪些困难呢？
    第一是饲料问题。“五坊”关闭，饲料的及时、就地的供应没有了。国营商业部门供应的饲料数少，质差，价贵，误时。现在每头猪只供应一百五十斤大麦。据农民说：如每头猪养到一百三十五斤，需要精饲料大麦三百斤，养到一百五十斤需要精饲料大麦三百五十斤，养到二百斤（二等）需要精饲料大麦四百斤。现在饲料质量低，如麦麸，过去一百斤小麦出粉六十八斤，出麸二十斤。麸子的含粉率为7.8％；现在出粉八十四斤出麸十四斤，麸含粉只有3％弱，当然营养就差。过去一百斤谷，出米六十一斤到六十五斤，现在出七十二斤到七十三斤，糠少了，质差了，猪吃了痾不下屎。豆饼质量也大大降低，过去含油率是7％—10％，现在只有3％—4％，砍也砍不动。不仅饲料质量差了，而且价钱又贵，麸皮每斤四·八分（高的达五·五分），大麦收购价每斤仅六·六分，一斤大麦换一·三七五斤麸皮，糠价每斤四·五分，稻子不过每斤七分。过去一百斤豆子可以换一百五十七斤豆饼，现在一百斤只可换一百二十三斤了。而且供应又不及时。另外，由于农民留下的口粮少了，有的地方，大麦留人吃，不给猪吃了。
    第二是资金问题。现在合作社里很多社员没有钱买小猪。据泰兴县典型调查，缺养猪资金的农户占40％。有的买了小猪，没有本钱养肥，养到五等就卖了。银行养猪贷款少，泰兴每头猪贷十元上下，只够买小猪，买下猪难养大。根据银行的材料：有一户养两口猪，共贷了四十三元，把猪养肥后就卖了一百零七元。可见贷了款就能帮助农民增加收入。
    第三是养猪不大合算。小猪价钱贵，一斤要六角，七角甚至一元。一头小猪要十元上下。壮猪每斤只卖三角钱（六等），一百一十五斤左右的壮猪卖价三十四元。肥猪价偏低，最近虽已调高了一点，可能还低一点。有的地方合作社给社员的肥粪作价也低，而且社员拿不到现钱。过去农民养猪，为了自己肥田，所以养猪积极性高；现在田入了社，小猪价贵，肥猪价低，猪粪价低又拿不到钱，这怎么能不妨碍农民养猪的积极性？
    由于“五坊”关闭，猪减少，田里收成不高，原有的农副业结合关系遭到削弱，虽然我们在农业上下了不少的功夫，虽然总的农业经济也不断地上升，但由于田少人多，社员仅靠种田就不能有效地增加收入。
    今年小麦减产，秋季作物估计只有平常年景，总的收入是否能增 加很成问题。因此，社员情绪动荡，有办法的出走，有的埋怨合作社，等社干部拿主意。除了加强政治工作外，从经济上巩固合作社，甚为必要。而从经济上巩固合作社，就不能离开原有的农副业结合的基础。
    我认为：如果在国家计划经济的指导下，在农业合作化的基础上，从当地原有的农副业结合的规律出发，发展农村经济，就可以使这一地区的农业生产赶上和超过抗日战争以前的最高水平，改善农民的生活，巩固合作社，供应国家更多的农副业产品。
      中心环节是在国家支持下，发动群众大量养猪。除了发动群众多收藏代用饲料和扩大高产作物面积以外，政府增加饲料供应，同时合理供应农民口粮，非常必要。
    其次是适当开放“五坊”。是否可以在重点生猪产区将花生、黄豆等油料作物，多留一些给当地群众自榨。以社为单位，恢复一些油坊，榨出的油卖给国家。或者由国家委托合作社加工。群众自己加工，豆饼、花生饼的价格比国家加工便宜，这就能够减低养猪成本。花生由社加工，国家只统购一部分花生仁，其余收购花生油。糟坊加工任务（制酒）能否也适当增加？能否根据需要，发展粉坊、磨坊和豆腐坊？
    再次是增加养猪贷款。贫农养一头猪，贷十五到二十元。同时还可以扩大预购，养到中猪时，先给一部分钱（八—十元）或粮，帮助社员把猪养壮。
    在价格政策方面，应当提高壮猪收购价格。为了鼓励社员把猪粪送社，应当对粪肥合理作价。
    结合农业生产计划拟定产猪计划。注重防疫工作（泰兴在四年中曾因防疫工作不够，先后死猪十万五千多头）。
