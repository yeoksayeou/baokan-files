The First Phase of the Anshan Iron and Steel New Sintering Plant Basically Completed
Two Giant Sintering Machines About to Go into Production

(Our Dispatch) Anshan Iron and Steel's new sintering plant, the largest man-made rich ore factory in our country, has basically completed its first phase of construction by early October after more than a year of intense work. Currently, the largest equipment in the new sintering plant project – two giant sintering machines – has been installed and is about to produce the "grain" urgently needed by iron-smelting furnaces: sintered ore. Several magnificent auxiliary workshops stand to the north of the sintering machines. The eighteen corridors between the main factory building and auxiliary workshops have been connected. Thousands of meters of gas pipelines have been connected to the Anshan Iron and Steel Gas Plant. The main equipment, such as the sintering machines, smoke exhausters, mixers, and four-roll crushers, have been inspected and accepted in batches by the acceptance committee. The trial operations by the production units are also normal.

The newly built sintering plant is a huge mechanized and automated factory, with eleven main and auxiliary workshops. The factory buildings are equipped with more than two hundred and forty pieces of equipment, mainly supplied by the Soviet Union. The largest sintering machine is as tall as a two-story building. After this factory is completed, people will not see any trace of the old-style sintering plants here. In the middle of the sintering workshop, there is a delicate control panel. Workers only need to flip a switch, and the machine will operate according to their wishes. The new sintering plant also has a set of dust removal and ventilation equipment. Above the sintering machines on both sides, there are artificial rain devices, so workers can still work comfortably even at the sintering ore feeding point. After the entire factory is completed, its production volume will be about one and a half times greater than the total volume of the current two sintering plants at Anshan Iron and Steel.

Following the imminent completion of the first phase, the second phase of construction has begun intensively. Materials, components, and various equipment are continuously being transported to the construction site. (Hong Sanli)

    鞍钢新烧结厂第一期工程基本完成
    两台巨大烧结机即将投入生产
    本报讯　我国最大的一座人造富矿工厂——鞍钢新烧结厂，经过一年多的紧张施工，第一期工程到10月上旬已基本完成。目前新烧结厂工程最大设备——两台巨大烧结机已经安装完毕，即将生产出炼铁炉迫切需要的粮食——烧结矿。几座雄伟的辅助车间，耸立在烧结机的北侧。主厂房和辅助车间之间的十八条通廊已连接起来。长达几千公尺的瓦斯管道已与鞍钢燃气厂接通，烧结机、抽烟机、混合机以及四滚破碎机等主要设备，经验收委员会分批复查和验收和生产单位的试运转的情况正常。
    新建的新烧结厂是一个巨大的机械化自动化的工厂，全厂有十一个主要车间和辅助车间，厂房里安装着二百四十多台设备，主要的设备是苏联供应的，最大烧结机有二层楼房高。这个工厂建成后，人们在这里将看不到一点旧式烧结工厂的痕迹。烧结车间的中间有一台精巧的操作盘，工人们只要扳动一下电钮，机器就按照人的心愿动作起来。在新烧结厂还有一套除尘和通风设备，烧结机的两傍上空，有人造雨的装置，工人们即使在烧结矿来料口处工作，也仍然很舒服。这个工厂全部建成后，它的生产量比鞍钢现在两座烧结厂的总量要大一倍半左右。
    紧接着第一期工程的即将完工，第二期工程已开始紧张施工，材料、构件和各种设备已源源运到工地。（洪三礼）
