　　First Batch of Jet Helicopters Produced
    The Soviet Union has manufactured its first batch of jet helicopters.
    Academician Yuriev recently told a "Moscow Truth" reporter that the development of jet technology is reflected in helicopter manufacturing. Designers have created helicopters that use jet engines to rotate the propellers. The jet engine it uses is relatively light and does not require complex and cumbersome gearboxes and transmissions. This increases the aircraft's carrying capacity.
    Currently, there are several types of jet helicopters. The most common type has engines mounted on the fuselage, which power the compressor. The compressed air flows along specially designed ducts to nozzles located at the tail end of the blades. The airflow released under pressure forms a jet force that rotates the propellers.
    Another type of helicopter has jet engines mounted directly on the tail end of the blades. Helicopters built according to this design do not fly badly, but because they consume a large amount of fuel, this type of aircraft has not been widely adopted until now. This type of aircraft is suitable for short-distance flights that do not require a large amount of fuel storage. For example, foreign countries are now greatly committed to using this type of helicopter as a "flying crane." With this aircraft, bridges can be erected across rivers from the air, and construction equipment, machinery, and other heavy goods can be transported to inaccessible mountainous areas.
　　Trial Use of Electronic Machines to Organize Data Cards
    The All-Union Scientific and Technical Information Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has been experimenting with the use of electronic machines to organize data cards.
    This institute, established in 1952, is a world-renowned center for scientific and technical information. It handles a vast amount of data, regularly collecting literature in fifty languages and publishing twelve guides on science and technology from around the world. In addition to a large number of translators, it also employs 13,000 part-time staff, including academicians, doctors, associate doctors, and engineers.
    In the past, classifying, organizing, and retrieving information took a lot of time. However, after the electronic machine completes its trials, it can retrieve and organize the cards to be searched and organized from tens of thousands of cards in a matter of minutes.
    The machine "reads" the cards based on the holes on the cards. Laboratory staff put a stack of punched cards in a drawer next to the machine, and after connecting the power, all the cards are sorted into categories according to the specified subject in just a few minutes.
　　Preparing to Create Solar Water Pumps to Transform the Desert
    The Solar Energy Technology Laboratory of the Soviet Energy Institute is studying the use of solar energy.
    How to use solar energy to turn the arid desert of Turkmenistan into a beautiful pastoral area is one of the problems that the laboratory's scientists are working hard to solve. In the Karakum Desert, large amounts of water are stored 20 to 30 meters underground. It is estimated that the energy absorbed by the desert from the sun is thirty times the amount of heat released by the entire earth when burning fuel. If this huge solar energy is used to drive water pumps to raise water to the ground and reduce the salt content in the water, it will be possible to irrigate the water-scarce desert and turn it into an oasis. They are now paying great attention to the creation of solar water pumps and new desalination systems.
    The laboratory's scientists have now designed several solar energy devices for daily use. They have designed a vegetable and fruit dryer that has high efficiency. Vegetables and fruits can be dried in this machine in one day and night, and the quality is very good. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　制出第一批喷气式直升飞机
    苏联已经制造出第一批喷气式直升飞机。
    尤里耶夫院士最近对“莫斯科真理报”记者谈到这件事情时说，喷气技术的发展在直升飞机制造业上得到了反映。设计师已经制造出用喷气式发动机来转动螺旋桨的直升飞机。它所使用的喷气式发动机的重量比较小，不需要复杂、累赘的减速器和传动装置。这样就使飞机的载重量增加。
    目前，已经有几种喷气式直升飞机。现在最普遍的一种直升飞机是在机身上装置发动机，发动机能够保证压缩机的工作。压缩的空气沿着特设的管道向位于桨叶尾端的喷嘴流动。在压力下放出的气流形成一股喷气力量，这种力量使螺旋桨转动起来。
    另一种直升飞机是把喷气式发动机直接装置在桨叶的尾端。根据这种图样制造的直升飞机飞行得并不坏，但是由于要消耗大量的燃料，这类飞机直到现在没有广泛采用。这种飞机适宜于不需要储存大量燃料的短距离飞行。例如，目前外国大大致力于把这种直升飞机当作“飞行起重机”使用。利用这种飞机，可以从空中架设横贯河流的桥梁，把建筑器材、机械和其他笨重的货物运到难以行走的山区。
　　试用电子机器整理资料卡片
    苏联科学院全苏科学技术情报研究所已经试用电子机器整理资料卡片。
    这个在1952年成立的研究所是举世无匹的科学和技术情报中心。它所处理的资料是非常浩繁的，它经常收集五十种语言的文献，出版十二种关于世界各国科学技术导报。除了大批翻译人员外，它还吸收了一万三千名兼职人员，包括科学院士、博士、副博士和工程师参加工作。
    过去在处理资料时，分类、整理和查取都要花费很多时间。但是，电子机器在完成试验后，可以在几分钟内从数以万计的卡片中取出和整理好所要查询和整理的卡片。
    这架机器是根据卡片上的孔眼来“阅读”卡片的。实验室的工作人员把一叠打了孔的卡片放在机器旁的抽斗里，接上电流不过几分钟，所有的卡片就按指定的题材分好类别。
　　准备创造太阳能水泵改造沙漠
    苏联能学研究所太阳能技术实验室正在研究利用太阳能的问题。
    如何利用太阳能把土库曼的干旱沙漠变成美丽的田园，是这个实验室的科学家正在全力研究的问题之一。在卡拉库姆沙漠二十到三十公尺深的地下，蕴藏有大量的水。据计算，沙漠从太阳所吸收的能量为整个地球在燃烧燃料时所放出的热量的三十倍。如果利用这种巨大的太阳能开动水泵，使水升到地面，并减少水中所含的盐分，就能够灌溉缺水的沙漠，把沙漠变成一片绿洲。他们现在非常重视创造太阳能水泵和新的去盐器系统的工作。
    实验室的科学家现在已经设计了几种生活用的太阳能设备。他们设计的一种蔬菜和水果用的烘干机具有很高的效能。蔬菜和水果在这种机器中经过一个昼夜就可以焙干，而且质量很好。　（新华社）
