    Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Great Thought and Great Personality
    — A Conversation with Mr. Zhou Zhenlin, a Veteran Member of the Tongmenghui
    By Our Staff Reporter Liu Shiping
    On the eve of the ninetieth anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth, we visited Mr. Zhou Zhenlin, an old friend of Sun Yat-sen during his lifetime. He is a veteran member of the Tongmenghui. As early as before the Xinhai Revolution—in 1905—Sun Yat-sen secretly sent someone from Japan to Changsha, Hunan, to invite him to join the Tongmenghui. At that time, although Mr. Zhou Zhenlin was engaged in education, he had already participated in revolutionary activities in the area south of the Yangtze River. Therefore, he gladly accepted Mr. Sun Yat-sen's invitation and joined the early Tongmenghui, and in the following year—1906—he went to Japan to meet Mr. Sun Yat-sen. "The meeting was held at the Kinki-kan in Tokyo, Japan; it was the first anniversary of the founding of the Tongmenghui's official newspaper, the Minbao." Mr. Zhou Zhenlin stroked his white beard, full of energy, recalling the events of fifty years ago, recounting that when Mr. Sun Yat-sen met him, he first cared about the domestic revolutionary situation. This eighty-year-old man, now seemed to have returned to his youth. He perked up, raised his voice, and said to us: "Mr. Sun Yat-sen was such a person, rarely talking about personal matters when meeting, and talking about revolution as soon as he opened his mouth." Then, Mr. Zhou Zhenlin talked about Sun Yat-sen's great thought and great personality. The following is Mr. Zhou Zhenlin's conversation:
    In the past, some people called Mr. Sun Yat-sen "Sun the Cannon." In fact, this is a joke. The so-called "Sun the Cannon," as the name suggests, means that Mr. Sun Yat-sen was not afraid of the emperors of the autocratic dynasty, nor was he afraid of the warlords of the feudal society. He had a spirit of great fearlessness and dared to fight against the emperors and warlords who were oppressing the people.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen's life was also very simple. For example, his stomach was not good, so he liked to eat vegetarian food, did not like to eat meat, and did not smoke or drink. In his spare time, he loved to read books and newspapers, and always had a book in his hand.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen also had a virtue. He could use people and could also listen to other people's opinions. Even for different opinions, he would not perfunctorily agree; if it was wrong, he would say it was wrong, neither flattering nor perfunctory.
    Since I first met Mr. Sun Yat-sen until the year before Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death, in the days I spent with Mr. Sun Yat-sen, I always saw that Mr. Sun Yat-sen liked to be close to the revolutionary masses; as long as he talked about revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen would talk endlessly about his patriotic views. After the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen returned from overseas. He was very happy to see the success of the Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew the Qing Dynasty's autocratic government and established the Republic of China. However, due to the incompleteness of the revolution, the imperialists secretly arranged for Yuan Shikai's resurgence in Beijing, maintaining China's feudalism and comprador regime through the means of replacing the sky and changing the day.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen firmly advocated the crusade against Yuan Shikai, the thief of the country. However, at that time, there were differences of opinion within the party. Some people believed that their strength was insufficient and disagreed with the crusade against Yuan. Finally, because Mr. Sun Yat-sen repeatedly explained the necessity of resolutely crusading against Yuan, the opinions were unified. Later, the crusade against Yuan unfortunately failed, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen went to Japan again to organize the Chinese Revolutionary Party and adhere to his revolutionary propositions.
    After the October Revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen was greatly encouraged. In a telegram to Lenin, Mr. Sun Yat-sen expressed his recognition of the Soviet Union. From that time on, Mr. Sun Yat-sen clearly saw who were the friends of the Chinese people and who were the enemies of the Chinese people, advocating "taking Russia as a teacher."
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen often taught us: In terms of political system, we must adopt the latest style and take Russia as our teacher. Because the new system is derived from the old system, and the old system has taken many tortuous detours, we cannot follow it in detours again. We must be actively progressive and not conservative.
    Therefore, before the reorganization of the Kuomintang, Mr. Sun Yat-sen sent Mr. Liao Zhongkai to the Soviet Union to study. After Liao Zhongkai returned to Shanghai, Mr. Sun Yat-sen learned about the unity within the Soviet Communist Party and the unity of military and political affairs, which made him very moved. In view of the loose organization and unstable unity within the Kuomintang, he decided to reorganize the Kuomintang. Therefore, in 1924, the First National Congress was held in Guangzhou, and a declaration was issued advocating the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers.
    Unfortunately, in the following year—1925—Mr. Sun Yat-sen died of illness in Beijing due to overwork. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will before his death said: "The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades still need to work hard." However, that revolution failed again because Chiang Kai-shek betrayed Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Before Mr. Sun Yat-sen died, I saw through that Chiang Kai-shek was a person who hung a sheep's head and sold dog meat. When Chiang Kai-shek was with Mr. Sun Yat-sen, he also talked about the Three People's Principles; but as soon as he left Mr. Sun Yat-sen, he completely violated the Three People's Principles.
    Recently, the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan has spread the fallacy that "nationalism and communism are ultimately incompatible." This argument is completely the same as that of Syngman Rhee. They do not want the motherland, they do not want the people, they are willing to sell out the motherland, live under the fence of the American aggressors, occupy Taiwan, and are so mad that if they do not repent and turn back, they may be destroyed without a day.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen always advocated national independence and liberation, advocated national unity, and advocated overthrowing colonialism during his lifetime. If Mr. Sun Yat-sen were alive, he would not know how heartbroken he would be to see what Chiang Kai-shek has done.
    In the broadcast manuscript for this year's 45th anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution and in the two articles "Remembering Old Friends of the Tongmenghui in Taiwan" and "The Responsibilities That Patriotic Overseas Chinese Should Fulfill" written in the inaugural issue of the Overseas Chinese Newspaper, I have already stated my views on the Taiwan liberation issue. In that broadcast speech, I put forward sincere wishes to the old friends of the Tongmenghui in Taiwan: "The spirit of our revolutionaries is not willing to be bullied by foreigners, and we are brave enough to admit mistakes. We must not act emotionally, take the path of failure, and cut ourselves off from the people of the motherland. Therefore, I believe that although you are trapped in Taiwan, you cannot be unmoved by the construction achievements of the motherland praised by the world. Based on the glorious struggle history of our Tongmenghui members in the past, who can not love the motherland, let alone the motherland that is advancing by leaps and bounds today, who can not love it?!"
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary goal was to seek freedom and equality for China, but in the thirty-eight years after the Xinhai Revolution, this goal was not achieved. It was not until seven years ago that the Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people to achieve the victory of the New Democratic Revolution and established the People's Republic of China that the Chinese people truly gained liberation, got rid of the oppression and enslavement of imperialism, and became the masters of the new China. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ideals and our original intention to participate in the revolution were truly realized. Therefore, today, as we commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth, I have infinite excitement and emotion. I hope that all compatriots in the country will unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party to build a socialist society.

### 孙中山先生的伟大思想和伟大人格——同盟会老会员周震鳞先生的谈话

    孙中山先生的伟大思想和伟大人格
    ——同盟会老会员周震鳞先生的谈话
    本报记者　刘时平
    在孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念的前夕，我们访问了孙中山先生生前的友好周震鳞老先生。他是同盟会的老会员。早在辛亥革命前——1905年的时候，孙中山先生从日本密派专人到湖南长沙邀请他参加同盟会。当时周震鳞先生虽然从事教育工作，但已经参加长江以南一带的革命活动，因此，他很高兴地接受了中山先生的邀请，参加了早期的同盟会，并在第二年——1906年去日本会见了中山先生。“会见是在日本东京的锦辉馆；那时，正是同盟会的机关报——民报创刊一周年纪念的时候。”周震鳞老先生抚摸着他的花白长髯，精神奕奕，回忆着五十年前的往事，追述当时中山先生见到他的时候，首先关心的是国内的革命情况。这位八十高龄的老人，现在好像回到了他的青春时代，他抖擞着精神，提高了嗓音，对我们说：“中山先生就是这样一种人，见面时很少谈私事，一开口就是谈革命。”接着，周震鳞先生就谈论到孙中山先生的伟大思想和伟大人格。下面就是周震鳞先生的谈话：
    过去有人把孙中山先生叫做“孙大炮”，其实这是一个笑话，所谓“孙大炮”，顾名思义，就是说孙中山先生不怕专制王朝的皇帝，也不怕封建社会的军阀，他有一种大无畏的精神，敢于向那些压在人民头上的皇帝和军阀进行斗争。
    孙中山先生的生活也很简单。譬如他的胃不好，因此好吃素的，不爱吃肉，也不抽烟、不喝酒。在工作之余，爱看书报，经常手不释卷。
    孙中山先生还有一种美德。他能用人，还能听取别人的意见。即使对于不同的意见，他可不敷衍，不对就说不对，既不恭维人，也不敷衍人。
    自从我第一次见到了孙中山先生以后，一直到中山先生临终的前一年，在和中山先生相处的日子里，我总是看到中山先生喜欢接近革命的群众；只要是谈起革命来，中山先生就滔滔不绝地谈起他的爱国主张。辛亥革命以后，中山先生从海外归来，他当时很高兴地看到辛亥革命的成功，推翻了清朝专制政府，建立了民国。但是由于革命的不彻底，帝国主义者暗中在北京布置了袁世凯的再起，用偷天换日的手段维持了中国的封建主义和买办政权。
    中山先生坚决主张讨伐窃国大盗袁世凯。但是当时党内意见纷歧，有的人认为自己力量不足，不同意讨袁。最后因为中山先生反复说明必须坚决讨袁的道理，意见才统一起来；后来，讨袁不幸失败，中山先生又到日本，组织中华革命党，坚持自己的革命主张。
    在十月革命以后，中山先生受到了巨大的鼓舞。中山先生在给列宁的电报中，表示承认苏联，从那个时候起，中山先生就看清楚了谁是中国人民的朋友，谁是中国人民的敌人。主张“以俄为师”。
    中山先生经常教导我们：在政治制度上一定要采取最新式的，要以俄为师。因为新的制度是从旧制度中脱胎出来的，旧的制度已经走了许多曲折迂回的弯路，我们不能再跟着它走弯路。一定要积极进步，不要保守。
    因此，在国民党改组以前，中山先生曾派廖仲恺先生到苏联去学习。廖仲恺回到上海以后，中山先生知道了苏联共产党的党内统一和军政统一，许多好处，使他十分感动。又鉴于国民党内组织不严密，团结不坚固，决定改组国民党。遂于1924年在广州召开第一次全国代表大会，发表宣言主张联俄、联共、扶助农工的三大政策。
    不幸的是在第二年——1925年，孙中山先生因积劳成病，在北京逝世。中山先生临终前的遗嘱说：“革命尚未成功，同志仍须努力。”可是那一次革命又因为蒋介石背叛了中山先生而致于失败。在中山先生没有逝世以前，我就看透了蒋介石这个人是一个挂羊头卖狗肉的人。当着蒋介石跟中山先生的时候口里也讲三民主义；但是一离开中山先生就完全违背三民主义了。
    最近蒋介石集团在台湾散布什么“民族主义与共产主义二者终是互不相容的”谬论。这种论调完全和李承晚如出一辙，他们不要祖国，不要人民，甘心出卖祖国，寄身在美国侵略者的篱下，盘据在台湾，丧心病狂，如不悔祸回头，恐将亡无日矣。
    中山先生在生前一向是主张民族独立解放，主张民族团结，主张打倒殖民主义者的，如果中山先生活着的话，看到蒋介石的所作所为，不知将如何痛心疾首。
    我在今年辛亥革命四十五周年纪念日的广播稿和在侨务报创刊号上写的“怀念在台湾的同盟会老友”及“爱国侨胞应尽的责任”两篇文章中，已经说了我对于解放台湾问题的意见。在那篇广播词里，我向在台湾的同盟会老友，提出了恳切的愿望：“我们革命党人的气魄是不甘外人欺侮的，是勇于承认错误的，决不能意气用事，硬走失败的道路，自绝于祖国人民。因此，我相信你们虽困居台湾，但对举世赞扬祖国建设事业，没有不动心的。凭我们同盟会会员过去的光荣斗争历史，谁能不热爱祖国，何况今天正在一日千里前进的祖国，更谁不热爱呢！？”
    孙中山先生的革命目的，在求中国之自由平等，而辛亥革命以后的三十八年中，并没有达到这一目的。一直到七年前中国共产党领导中国人民取得了新民主主义革命的胜利，建立了中华人民共和国，中国人民才真正地获得了解放，摆脱了帝国主义的压迫和奴役，成为新中国的主人翁，而孙中山先生的理想和我们参加革命的初衷也才真正得到了实现。因此，在今天来纪念孙中山先生九十周年诞辰，我真有无限的兴奋和感慨，但愿全国同胞更加团结在中国共产党的周围，来建设社会主义社会。
