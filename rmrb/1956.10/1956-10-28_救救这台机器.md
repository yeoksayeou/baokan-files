    Save This Machine
    In November 1955, the Southwest Geological Bureau's Team 501 transported a new machine weighing eleven tons—a three-cylinder horizontal high-pressure water pump—from another location to Kunming. Because the safety standards of the Kunbi Line's tunnels were too low, the machine could not be transported through them. As a result, the machine was placed in the station's open space awaiting disposal. Until now, the machine remains unmoved, but it is completely unrecognizable. The packaging wood has long been broken into pieces. After being exposed to sun and rain, a thick layer of rust has accumulated on the machine, and the machine has become a nest for birds and mice. But the heartless owner still doesn't pay any attention to it. If this continues, I am afraid it will become scrap. I hope the Southwest Geological Bureau will quickly save this poor machine.

    救救这台机器
    1955年11月，西南地质局五○一队从外地把一台重十一吨的新机器——三缸卧式高压水泵运到昆明。因昆碧线的山洞安全标准较低，不能运输这台机器。于是机器就被放在车站空地上等待处理。直到现在，这部机器仍躺在原地未动，可是已面目全非了，包装木板早已支离破碎，经过日晒雨淋，机器上已积了很厚一层铁锈，机器已变成小鸟和老鼠的巢穴。可是狠心的主人仍不去理睬他一眼。若再这样下去，恐怕就要变成废料了。希望西南地质局赶快救救这台可怜的机器。
