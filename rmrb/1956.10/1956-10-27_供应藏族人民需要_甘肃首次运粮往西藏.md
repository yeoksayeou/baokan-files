    Gansu Transports Grain to Tibet for the First Time
  Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 24th—This year, Gansu Province transported over 23 million jin of grain to Tibet for the first time to supply the needs of the Tibetan people. Another 9 million jin of grain is concentrated in Wuwei, Minle, and other places, and is also preparing to be transported to Tibet continuously. In addition, Gansu Province has already transported tens of millions of jin of grain to the Bayannur League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai, and the pastoral areas inhabited by ethnic minorities in Gansu Province this year.
    In recent years, the agricultural areas of Gansu Province have achieved bumper harvests. Therefore, the grain that agricultural areas provide to support ethnic minority pastoral areas has also increased significantly. According to statistics from the Storage and Transportation Administration Bureau of the Provincial Grain Department, the amount of grain transported to ethnic minority areas inside and outside the province from January to September this year increased by 63.2% compared to the same period last year.
