    Reflections on "No Picking Allowed"
　  Jin San
    The vegetable stalls in the Chaoyangmen Inner Street vegetable market in Beijing have this rule: buyers are not allowed to freely pick vegetables; they must take whatever is given, regardless of good or bad quality, and the price is the same for all. Their reasoning is: if free picking is allowed, everyone will pick the good ones, and who will buy the bad ones that are left? If you express dissatisfaction with this method, they will say: all the vegetable stalls are like this, take it or leave it; sometimes, they even add: we get it from the state-owned company like this.
    However, this method does not suit the needs of consumers. Different consumers have different requirements for vegetables. Some like to eat older ones, some like to eat younger ones; some like to eat larger ones, some prefer smaller ones; some are willing to spend more money to buy good ones, and some are willing to spend less money to buy slightly inferior ones. In short, people's needs and tastes are not the same, but diverse. These diverse requirements are a reflection of people's diverse lives. A sales method that does not differentiate between good and bad and charges the same price for everything will inevitably fail to meet these diverse consumer demands.
    This bureaucratic style of management did not exist when they were individually operated, but was acquired after they became cooperative and monopolized the market. To correct this deviation, it is not very difficult. As long as the service attitude is changed, the policy of free picking and differentiated pricing can be earnestly implemented.

    对“不准挑”有感
　  金三
    北京朝阳门里大街菜市场的青菜摊贩，有这样的规矩：不许买菜的人自由挑选，给什么就得要什么，好坏不分，价钱一律。他们的理由是：要容许自由挑选，大家都挑好的，剩下孬的卖给谁？如果你对他们这种办法表示不满的话，他们会说：各个菜摊都是这样，要不要由你；有时，还补上一句：我们就是这样从国营公司批来的。
    然而，他们这种办法并不适合消费者的要求。不同的消费者对于青菜有不同的要求。有的喜欢吃老一点的，有的喜欢吃嫩一点的；有的喜欢吃大的，有的则喜欢吃小的；有的情愿多花几个钱买好的，有的则愿意少出钱买次一点的。总之人们的要求和口胃并不是一样的，而是多种多样的。这种多种多样的要求是人们多种多样的生活的反映。好坏不分、价钱一律的售货办法，必然不能满足消费者这种多种多样的要求。
    这种官僚主义的经营作风，并不是他们在个体经营时就有了的，而是在他们合作化以后，独占了市场，才沾染上的。要纠正这种偏向，也不十分困难，只要转变了服务态度，自由挑选、分等论价的政策就能认真地贯彻执行。
