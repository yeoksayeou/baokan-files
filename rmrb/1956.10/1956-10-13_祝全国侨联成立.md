    Congratulations on the Establishment of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese

    At the First National Congress of Returned Overseas Chinese, representatives of returned Overseas Chinese from all over the country gathered together to establish the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and elected Mr. Tan Kah Kee as chairman. Returned Overseas Chinese representatives from major overseas Chinese residing areas participated in the leadership work. This is a very congratulatory thing. It marks a further strengthening of the unity of returned Overseas Chinese, their relatives, and Overseas Chinese abroad.

    Overseas Chinese have always been patriotic and love their hometowns. They are very willing to contribute to the motherland and their hometowns. However, under the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in old China, the countryside went bankrupt, and warlords were divided. There was no way to talk about building the motherland or building their hometowns. After the founding of New China, the situation was fundamentally different. Our country has become a great independent and autonomous country. Returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives in various places have also actively participated in the construction of the motherland along with the people of the whole country. The number of households of Overseas Chinese relatives participating in agricultural production cooperatives has reached more than 90% of the total number of households of Overseas Chinese relatives, and many returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives have become advanced producers and model workers. Some returned Overseas Chinese have also established Overseas Chinese farms, sugar factories, textile factories, and developed beach aquaculture farms and rubber plantations, giving full play to their expertise in planting tropical and subtropical cash crops. In the past year, returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives have built, expanded, and planned to build 25 middle schools and more than 100 primary schools. As for public welfare undertakings such as farmland water conservancy, bridge repairs, and road repairs in Overseas Chinese hometowns, there are also many.

    Thanks to the care and support of the Party and the People's Government, in recent years, associations of returned Overseas Chinese have been established in counties and cities where returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives are relatively concentrated. The Overseas Chinese federations in various places have responded to the call of the state in various political movements and central tasks, actively publicized Overseas Chinese affairs policies, mobilized returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives to participate in socialist transformation and socialist construction, handled matters entrusted by returned Overseas Chinese, their relatives, and Overseas Chinese abroad, assisted local governments in guiding Overseas Chinese investment and running public welfare undertakings such as Overseas Chinese hometown welfare and culture, and reflected the opinions and demands of returned Overseas Chinese, their relatives, and Overseas Chinese abroad to Party and government organs, and achieved considerable results. In order to accelerate my country's socialist construction, it is necessary to unite returned Overseas Chinese, their relatives, and Overseas Chinese abroad more widely. Decentralized local Overseas Chinese federations cannot fully adapt to the current needs. Therefore, returned Overseas Chinese in various places requested the establishment of a national organization in order to lead the Overseas Chinese federations in various places and actively carry out work.

    Now, the establishment of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese is very timely. The establishment of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese will undoubtedly play an important role in uniting more than 20 million returned Overseas Chinese, their relatives, and Overseas Chinese abroad, and expanding the unity of Overseas Chinese. We hope that the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese will conduct patriotic and socialist education among returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives extensively and in-depth, lead returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives to study national policies and laws, and mobilize returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives to actively participate in the cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction; introduce the domestic situation and national policies to Overseas Chinese abroad as much as possible, and introduce the situation of Overseas Chinese abroad to the people of the motherland as much as possible, so as to communicate mutual understanding between the people of the motherland and Overseas Chinese compatriots.

    In recent years, Party and government organs in various places have achieved great results in implementing Overseas Chinese affairs policies and organizing returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives to participate in socialist construction together with the people of the whole country, based on the characteristics of returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives. However, some shortcomings and errors have also occurred. The main reason is that there is bureaucracy in relevant organs and some staff members, and they do not understand the special circumstances and requirements of returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives, and they do not care enough about their lives. We hope that the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese will not only reflect the opinions and demands of returned Overseas Chinese, their relatives, and Overseas Chinese abroad to Party and government organs, and serve returned Overseas Chinese, their relatives, and Overseas Chinese abroad earnestly; but also give play to the enthusiasm of returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives, and put forward active suggestions and criticisms on various Overseas Chinese affairs work, and supervise Party and government organs to correctly implement Overseas Chinese affairs policies. Overseas Chinese affairs work is a complex work, involving a wide range, and is almost related to the work of various departments. To do this work well, on the one hand, it certainly requires the efforts of relevant organs, especially Overseas Chinese affairs organs, and on the other hand, it also requires the assistance and supervision of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and the Overseas Chinese federations in various places. All our country's work needs supervision from the masses from the bottom up. Of course, complex Overseas Chinese affairs work needs more supervision from returned Overseas Chinese, their relatives, and Overseas Chinese abroad. We not only need to supervise Overseas Chinese affairs workers at all levels, but also need to supervise relevant state organs and Party organizations. In this way, we can make fewer mistakes in Overseas Chinese affairs work and avoid avoidable shortcomings and errors.

    The broadest Overseas Chinese united front is not only conducive to uniting all possible forces and accelerating my country's socialist construction, but also plays a significant role in striving for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. We hope that the Overseas Chinese Federation will closely contact Overseas Chinese abroad and promote the peaceful liberation of Taiwan from all aspects, and actively strive for the early realization of the motherland's reunification. Tell the broad masses of Overseas Chinese about the policy and benefits of peacefully liberating Taiwan, so that Overseas Chinese abroad, on the basis of loving the motherland, can unite more widely regardless of occupation, class, or belief. Do not be satisfied with the unity of progressive Overseas Chinese, but should unite all possible people, and strive to unite all Overseas Chinese. To those Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan and overseas, no matter how serious their crimes were in the past, as long as they love the country today, they should adhere to the principle of "patriotism belongs to one family" and the spirit of national unity and unanimous opposition to foreign countries, treat each other with sincerity, do not blame the past, and welcome them to contribute their strength to the liberation of Taiwan and the construction of the motherland.

    祝全国侨联成立
    在全国归国华侨第一次代表大会上，全国各地的归国华侨代表齐集一堂，成立了中华全国归国华侨联合会，选出了陈嘉庚先生为主席，各主要侨居地都有归侨代表参加领导工作，这是一件非常值得庆贺的事情。它标志着归侨、侨眷和国外华侨团结的进一步加强。
    华侨素来是爱国爱乡的。他们很愿意对祖国和家乡有所贡献。但是，旧中国受帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，农村破产，军阀割据，根本谈不上建设祖国、建设家乡。新中国成立以后，情况根本不同了。我国已经成为独立自主的伟大国家。各地归侨、侨眷也和全国人民一道积极参加了祖国的建设。侨眷参加农业生产合作社的户数已达侨眷总户数的90％以上，许多归侨、侨眷成了先进生产者和劳动模范。有些归侨还举办华侨农场、糖厂、纺织厂、开辟海滩养殖场和橡胶园，发挥了他们种植热带和亚热带经济作物的特长。一年来，归侨、侨眷兴建、扩建和筹建的中学有二十五所，小学有一百多所，至于在侨乡兴办的农田水利、修桥补路等公益事业也很多。
    由于党和人民政府的关怀和支持，几年来，在归侨、侨眷比较集中的县市，都先后成立了归国华侨联谊会。各地侨联在各项政治运动和中心工作中都响应了国家的号召，积极宣传侨务政策，动员归侨、侨眷参加社会主义改造和社会主义建设，接办归侨、侨眷和国外华侨委托的事项，协助地方政府辅导华侨投资和兴办侨乡福利、文化等公益事业，向党政机关反映归侨、侨眷和国外华侨的意见和要求，获得了不少成绩。为了加速我国社会主义建设，必须更广泛地把归侨、侨眷和国外华侨团结起来。分散的地方性的侨联组织，是不能完全适应当前需要的。因此，各地归侨要求成立全国性的组织，以便领导各地侨联，积极展开工作。
    现在，全国侨联成立了，这是非常适时的。全国侨联成立无疑地对团结两千多万归侨、侨眷和国外华侨，扩大华侨的团结是有重要作用的。我们希望全国侨联广泛地深入地向归侨、侨眷进行爱国主义和社会主义的教育，领导归侨、侨眷学习国家政策法令，发动归侨、侨眷积极参加社会主义改造和社会主义建设的事业；把国内情况和国家政策多多介绍给国外华侨，把国外华侨的情况多多介绍给祖国人民，沟通祖国人民同国外侨胞间的互相了解。
    几年来，各地党政机关根据归侨、侨眷的特点，贯彻侨务政策，组织归侨、侨眷和全国人民一道参加社会主义建设，获得了很大的成绩，但是也发生了一些缺点和错误，其主要原因是由于有关机关和某些工作人员存在着官僚主义，对于归侨、侨眷的特殊情况和要求了解不足，对他们的生活关心不够。我们希望全国侨联不仅把全国归侨、侨眷和国外华侨的意见和要求反映给党、政机关，认真地为归侨、侨眷和国外华侨服务；而且要发挥归侨、侨眷的积极性，对各项侨务工作提出积极的建议和批评，监督党、政机关正确执行侨务政策。侨务工作是一项复杂的工作，牵涉范围很广，几乎和各部门的工作都有关系。要做好这一工作，一方面固然需要有关机关特别是侨务机关的努力，另一方面也需要全国侨联和各地侨联的协助和监督。我们国家的一切工作都需要自下而上的来自群众的监督，当然，复杂的侨务工作就更加需要来自归侨、侨眷和国外华侨的监督。我们不仅需要对各级侨务工作者进行监督，而且需要对有关的国家机关和党组织进行监督。这样，才可以使侨务工作少犯错误，避免可以避免的缺点和错误。
    最广泛的华侨统一战线，不仅有利于团结一切可能团结的力量，加速我国社会主义建设，而且对于争取和平解放台湾也有重大的作用。我们希望侨联密切联系国外华侨，从各方面来推动和平解放台湾，为早日实现祖国的统一大业而积极努力。把和平解放台湾的方针和好处告诉广大华侨，使国外华侨在爱护祖国的基础上，不分职业、阶级和信仰，更加广泛地团结起来，不要满足于进步华侨的团结，而应该团结一切可能团结的人，争取把全体华侨都团结起来。对那些在台湾和海外的国民党军政人员，不论过去他们罪行多大，只要他们今天爱国，都应本“爱国一家”的原则和全民团结、一致对外的精神，相见以诚，不咎既往，欢迎他们为解放台湾、为建设祖国贡献自己的力量。
