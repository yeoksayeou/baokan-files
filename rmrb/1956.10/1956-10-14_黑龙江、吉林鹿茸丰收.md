Heilongjiang and Jilin Achieve Bumper Harvests of Antler Velvet

    (Report) Heilongjiang Province has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of antler velvet this year. The province's pharmaceutical company has already purchased 14,400 liang of antler velvet. It is estimated that another 1,600 liang can be purchased by the end of the year, for a total of 16,000 liang this year. This is an increase of approximately 54% compared to the actual completion of 10,400 liang in 1955.
    Antler velvet is a very precious traditional Chinese medicine, which is needed not only throughout the country but also occupies a very important position in the international market.
    To support exports and meet the needs of urban and rural areas, the province's pharmaceutical company has supplied 2,768 liang to the export company and has also organized the processing of more than 1,700 liang of antler velvet slices for medical prescriptions. In addition, it has supplied 2,880 liang to the Harbin Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory for the manufacture of "Deer Antler Velvet Essence." (Mu Ziguang)
    (Report) The six deer farms in Dongfeng, Fusong, and other locations in Jilin Province have achieved excellent results in the production of antler velvet and deer. A total of 10,346 liang of antler velvet were harvested from 11,015 male production deer. Of the 1,431 female deer, 999 fawns have survived. The production of antler velvet exceeded the state plan by 105.48%, an increase of 2,500 liang compared to last year.
    The quality of the antler velvet produced this year is also good. First-class products accounted for 70.9% of the 1,015 pairs of antlers produced, an increase of 1.2% compared to last year, and new high-yield records have also appeared. One pair of three-fork cut antlers produced by the Longtanshan Deer Farm weighed 46 liang. The export of this pair alone can be exchanged for ten tons of steel or twenty tons of gasoline. Good results have also been achieved in deer breeding. The survival rate of fawns bred at the Dongfeng Deer Farm reached 87.5%, an increase of 2.3% compared to 1955. (Wang Lingyun)

    鹿茸是一种很珍贵的中药材，不仅国内各地需要，而且在国际市场上也占着很重要的地位。
    为支援出口和满足城乡需要，该省药材公司除供应出口公司二千七百六十八两外，并组织加工一千七百多两鹿茸片供医疗配方需要，此外还供给哈尔滨化学制药厂二千八百八十两供制造“鹿茸精”之用。　（母子光）
