Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The track and field athlete trials for the Chinese Olympic team began today in Beijing.

At 2:00 PM today, the opening ceremony of the trials was held at the Beijing Xian Nong Tan Stadium. More than 580 athletes participating in the trials marched around the field in formation to music. The male and female athletes participating in this trial come from 26 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, as well as Hong Kong, Macau, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army system. The vast majority of them have achieved the national athlete standard, and many are the holders of national records. Today, the audience welcomed the athletes from Hong Kong and Macau with warm applause.

Rong Gaotang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Sports Federation and Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee for China's Participation in the 16th Olympic Games, spoke at the opening ceremony. He expressed his hope that all athletes would learn from each other, exchange experiences, and create more and better new records for the motherland on the basis of generally improving their athletic and technical level with a tenacious and courageous spirit and a humble and cautious attitude.

The trials will last for five days and end on the 18th.

This newspaper reports: Yesterday, on the first day of the track and field athlete trials, the preliminary and final rounds of the men's high jump and men's javelin, the preliminary and final rounds of the women's shot put, and the final round of the men's 3000-meter steeplechase were held. In addition, the preliminary and secondary rounds of the men's 100-meter dash, the preliminary rounds of the men's 400-meter and 1500-meter races, and the preliminary rounds of the women's 100-meter, 800-meter, and 800-meter relay races were held. The preliminary rounds of cycling competitions were also held on the newly opened track and field at the Beijing Gymnasium.

Yu Jin'an Sets New National Javelin Record

Participants in the preliminary and final rounds of the men's javelin throw included Yu Jin'an, the national record holder for this event, and Ma Changlu, an athlete from Tianjin who set a new national record of 66.13 meters in July of this year. Ma Changlu threw first, and when the javelin he threw passed the small red flag marking the national record, thunderous applause erupted from the stands. At this time, Yu Jin'an was also testing the balance point of the javelin and adjusting his grip. Now it was his turn to throw. His natural and coordinated carrying of the javelin on his shoulder and rhythmic run-up attracted the attention of the audience. More than 20,000 spectators nervously watched the javelin flying through the air. The javelin finally glided far beyond the small red flag and landed on the ground. The result was 68.78 meters, breaking the national record of 61.11 meters, exceeding the national record set by Ma Changlu, and reaching the national Master of Sports standard. This result has exceeded the entry standard of 66 meters for the men's javelin at the 16th Olympic Games. Ma Changlu won second place in the javelin competition with a score of 65.57 meters, also breaking the national record.

New Event: 3000-Meter Steeplechase

The 3000-meter steeplechase is China's newest track and field event, and it requires running seven laps at the Xian Nong Tan Stadium. Each lap has five wooden hurdles, one of which is a water jump. Athletes must jump over these obstacles continuously. When the starting gun fired, Beijing athlete Tian Xiudong led from the second lap onwards, his light and rhythmic steps like wings in flight. His movement over the water jump was even more agile: one foot skillfully stepped onto the wooden frame, and the other foot stretched forward to easily cross the water. He won first place with a time of 9 minutes and 53 seconds.

Jumps Higher Than His Own Body

Yunnan athlete Ma Xianglong (male) is 1.78 meters tall; yesterday he jumped over 1.90 meters, defeating the national high jump record holder Li Dapei to take first place. This result broke the national record.

Shi Baozhu Wins First Place in Shot Put

Liaoning female athlete Shi Baozhu won first place in the shot put competition with a score of 12.26 meters, not exceeding the national record she had previously set.

    田径运动员选拔赛开始
    新华社14日讯　中国奥林匹克运动队田径运动员选拔赛今天开始在北京举行。
    今天下午二时，在北京市先农坛体育场举行了选拔赛的开幕式，五百八十多名参加这次选拔赛的运动员，在乐曲声中整队绕场一周。参加这次选拔赛的男、女运动员来自二十六个省、市、自治区以及香港、澳门和中国人民解放军系统。他们当中的绝大部分人的运动成绩都达到了国家等级运动员标准，有很多人是全国最高成绩的保持者。今天，观众以热烈的掌声欢迎了来自香港和澳门的运动员。
    中华全国体育总会副主席、中国参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会筹备委员会副主任荣高棠在开幕式上讲话，他希望全体运动员能以顽强勇敢的精神和谦虚谨慎的态度，互相学习，交流经验，在普遍提高运动技术水平的基础上，为祖国创造出更多、更好的新纪录。

    本报讯　昨天，田径运动员选拔赛的第一天，举行了男子跳高和男子标枪的预决赛，女子铅球预决赛，男子三千公尺障碍跑的决赛；另外还举行了男子一百公尺的预赛和次赛，男子四百公尺、一千五百公尺的预赛，女子一百公尺、八百公尺和八百公尺接力的预赛。在北京体育馆旁新开辟的田径场上还举行了自行车比赛的预赛。
    于金安创标枪全国最高成绩
    参加男子标枪掷远预决赛的有这个项目的全国最高纪录保持者于金安和在今年7月间以六十六公尺十三公分创造全国最高成绩的天津市运动员马长路。马长路先掷，他投出的标枪越过标志着全国最高纪录的小红旗时，看台上即响起春雷般的掌声。这时于金安也正在试枪的重心点，调整握枪的位置。现在该他投掷了。他那自然协调的肩上携枪和有韵律的助跑投出，都引起了观众的注目，两万多观众紧张地盯着枪身在空中的飞进，标枪终于滑翔到远远超过小红旗的地方插在地上，成绩是六十八公尺七十八公分，打破了六十一公尺十一公分的全国最高纪录，也超过了马长路所创造的全国最高成绩，并且达到了国家运动健将级的标准。这个成绩已经超过了第十六届奥林匹克运动会男子标枪六十六公尺的入选标准。马长路获得标枪比赛的第二名，成绩是六十五公尺五十七公分，也打破了全国最高纪录。
    新项目三千公尺障碍跑
    三千公尺障碍跑是我国最新的田径项目，在先农坛体育场要跑七圈。每圈设有五个木架障碍，其中有一个水池障碍。运动员要连续跳过这些障碍。发令枪声响了，北京市运动员田秀东从第二圈起一直领先，他那轻快而有节奏的步子像展翅在飞一样。他越过水池的动作更为矫健：一只脚很熟练地蹬上木架，另一只脚便前伸轻便地越过水池。他以九分五十三秒的成绩获得第一。
    跳得比自己身体还高
    云南省运动员马翔龙（男）身高一公尺七十八公分；他昨天跳过了一公尺九十公分，战胜了男子跳高全国纪录保持者李大培，取得第一，这个成绩打破了全国最高纪录。
    石宝珠得推铅球第一
