    A Pure White Heart
    Worker Han Yiping
During the day, sunlight shines into the workshop, and at night, the girl has many suns over her head. Her circulating steps never stop, and the cloth grows longer and longer with her steps. The red light on the steel beam dims and brightens again. Her hands and eyes never leave the fabric. The cloth she weaves is her pure white heart, like snow-white clouds floating in the blue sky. When she stops and secretly looks around, she is like a peacock standing on a tree laden with fruit. Only yesterday she carefully folded away her red scarf, and today she has become such an outstanding worker.

    洁白的心　　
    工人　韩忆萍白天这里有阳光照射车间，晚上姑娘的头上又有许多太阳。她巡回的脚步时刻不停，布匹随着脚步越走越长。钢梁上的红灯明了又暗淡，她的手和眼睛不离布面，织出的布呵，是她洁白的心，又像飘在蓝天上雪白的浮云。当她停住脚步偷偷向人张望，像孔雀站在果实累累的树上。她昨天才将红领巾珍惜地叠起，今天成了多么出色的工人。
