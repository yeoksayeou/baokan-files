Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 11th - Shaanxi and Gansu provinces are currently constructing and renovating eight pairs of coal mines. Once these coal mines are fully operational and reach their designed output, the annual coal production of the two provinces will increase more than threefold.

These newly constructed coal mines are distributed in the Tongchuan area of the Weibei coalfield in Shaanxi Province, the Agan town near Lanzhou in Gansu Province, and the Shandan mining area in the Hexi Corridor. Among the six pairs of newly built mines, one is a horizontal adit and one is an inclined shaft, with the remainder being medium-sized vertical shafts. The total designed annual output of the two pairs of renovated mines will be nearly doubled compared to the old mines.

The original coal industry in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces had a weak foundation and backward mining conditions. With the exception of the Shandan No. 2 Coal Mine, which is intended for exploring underground coal seams and has a relatively low level of mechanization in the production process, the remaining eight pairs of newly built and renovated mines are all new-type mines. The mining life can reach from thirty to eighty years.

After these newly built and renovated mines go into production, they will all use pneumatic picks, electric picks, or combined coal mining machines for coal extraction. Underground coal transportation will use electric locomotives and chain conveyor, and other transportation tools. The mine shaft hoisting will also use electric or steam-powered winches.

    陕西、甘肃正在新建和改建八对煤井
    新华社西安11日电　陕西、甘肃两省正在新建和改建八对煤井。等到这些煤井全部投入生产达到设计产量以后，两省每年所产的煤，将增加三倍以上。
    这批新建煤井，分布在陕西省渭北煤田的铜川、甘肃省兰州附近的阿干镇和河西走廊的山丹三个矿区。新建的六对矿井中，有一对平洞和一对斜井，其余的都是中型竖井；改建的两对矿井，总的设计年产量，比旧矿井提高将近两倍。
    陕西和甘肃两省的原有煤炭工业，基础薄弱，开采条件落后。新建和改建的八对矿井，除了山丹二号煤井是以勘探地下煤层为目的，生产过程机械化水平较低以外，其余的都是新型矿井；开采年限能达到三十年到八十年。
    这些新建和改建的矿井投入生产后，都将利用风镐、电镐或联合采煤机采煤；地下运煤，将用电机车和链板运输机等运输工具；井口提升也采用电动的或汽动的绞车。
