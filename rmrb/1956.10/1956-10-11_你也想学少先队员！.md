    "You Also Want to Learn from the Young Pioneers!"
    One day, we returned from a visit to the Summer Palace. The union chairman was responsible for buying bus tickets, but he miscalculated the number of people and bought one ticket short. It was only after entering the office that everyone realized it.
    One comrade suggested, "Let's send a dime to the bus company."
    The union chairman sarcastically replied, "You also want to learn from the Young Pioneers?..." Before he could finish speaking, everyone burst out laughing.
    Unexpectedly, the honest and valuable qualities of the Young Pioneers were seen as childish and laughable by these comrades.　Wan Nian

    “你也想学少先队员！”
    一天，我们从颐和园游玩了回来，工会主席负责买汽车票，由于算错了人数，少买了一张车票。进了机关以后，大家才发觉到。
    一位同志建议说：“我们给汽车公司寄一毛钱去。”
    工会主席讽刺地回答说：“你也想学少先队员？……话还未了，引起大伙大笑了起来。
    想不到，少先队员诚实可贵的品质，竟被这些同志看作是幼稚可笑的。　宛念
