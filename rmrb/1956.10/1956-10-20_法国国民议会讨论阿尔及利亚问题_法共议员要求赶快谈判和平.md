Xinhua News Agency report: The French National Assembly held a debate on the Algerian question on October 17th. Some right-wing deputies, including former Governor-General of Algeria Soustelle, advocated continuing a "tough" policy of suppression in Algeria.

Deputy Jeannette Vermeersch delivered a lengthy speech on behalf of the Communist Party parliamentary group. She said that the French people have been waiting for nearly ten months for the "Republican Front" government to take measures to achieve peace in Algeria. Achieving peace in Algeria is the consistent demand of the majority of French people, but the Socialists have not fulfilled their promises, they are increasingly deviating from their program, and are expanding military installations and increasing military spending.

Vermeersch said that as long as a ceasefire is achieved and negotiations are held on the basis of equality and recognition of the right of all nations to handle their own affairs, we will be able to quickly strive for peace. For the benefit of France and Algeria, and for the sake of peace, negotiations must be conducted quickly while it is not too late.

Deputy Pierre Cot of the Progressive Republican Union said in his speech that the government's military measures have not achieved good results, and this government has not implemented the social and economic reforms it promised to implement in Algeria. He said that the Mollet government has so far not put forward any constructive solutions to the Algerian question, and that there is no other solution to this question except to negotiate with representatives of the Algerian National Liberation Front.

    法国国民议会讨论阿尔及利亚问题
    法共议员要求赶快谈判和平
    据新华社讯　法国国民议会10月17日会议就阿尔及利亚问题进行辩论。包括前阿尔及利亚总督苏斯戴尔在内的一些右派议员主张在阿尔及利亚继续实行“强硬的”镇压政策。
    议员让纳特·维美徐代表共产党议会党团作了长篇发言。她说，法国人民等待“共和阵线”政府采取实现阿尔及利亚和平的措施，已经快有十个月了。实现阿尔及利亚的和平是大多数法国人的一贯要求，但是社会党人并没有履行他们的诺言，他们越来越背离他们的纲领，并且正在扩大军事设施和增加军费开支。
    维美徐说，只要实现停火，双方在平等和承认各民族处理自己事务的权利的基础上举行谈判，我们就能够迅速地争取到和平。为了法国和阿尔及利亚的利益，为了和平的利益，必须趁现在为时还不太晚，赶快进行谈判。
    进步共和联盟议员皮埃尔·戈特在发言中说，政府的军事措施并没有取得良好的结果，这个政府也没有在阿尔及利亚实行它所答应实行的社会和经济方面的改革。他说，摩勒政府至今没有提出任何建设性地解决阿尔及利亚问题的办法，而在这个问题上，除了同阿尔及利亚全国解放阵线的代表进行谈判以外，是别无其他解决办法的。
