The heroic actions of the Japanese people in defending their land and sovereignty
Pei Da
    On October 12th and 13th, the Japanese government authorities, succumbing to pressure from the United States, forcibly measured the land of residents in Sunagawa Town to expand the U.S. Tachikawa Air Base, even using force against the local residents, injuring more than a thousand people. The blood of the Japanese people stained the land they were determined to defend, demonstrating their heroic and unyielding fighting spirit.
    The struggle of the residents of Sunagawa Town, Tokyo, against the expansion of the U.S. Air Force base was forced upon them after the U.S. military authorities and the Japanese government decided to expand five airfields (Tachikawa, Yokota, Kisarazu, Niigata, Komaki) last spring. The residents of Sunagawa Town believe that if the U.S. Air Force base is expanded, allowing U.S. planes loaded with atomic bombs to take off and land on Japanese soil, it will not only mean losing their homes and land, but more seriously, it will threaten the peace and security of Japan. Therefore, for the past year and a half, the residents of Sunagawa Town, with the support of workers, students, and cultural circles throughout the country, have bravely persisted in their struggle against the expansion of the Tachikawa U.S. military base. Although the Japanese official surveying teams went to measure several times, they were met with resolute resistance from the residents of Sunagawa Town, preventing the U.S. expansion plan from proceeding smoothly. In the past, the residents of Sunagawa Town had firmly stated: "The stakes cannot be driven into our hearts, and we will not let them be driven into the land!" After this incident, the mayor of Sunagawa Town, Miyazaki, said at a mass rally that the residents of Sunagawa Town are determined to resist the government's suppression and would rather be crushed to death by road rollers than let them take their land. This demonstrates the heroic spirit of the residents of Sunagawa Town in defending their homes and land sovereignty.
    The struggle of the residents of Sunagawa Town has become a shining banner for the people of Japan in defending their land and sovereignty. This struggle has set an example for the residents of other bases, encouraging the fighting courage and confidence of the people of Japan. The residents of Sunagawa Town have demonstrated such heroism and tenacity in their struggle mainly because they have a united determination and have never succumbed to violence. In the Sunagawa Town Assembly, led by the mayor and the speaker, whether they are Socialist Party or Liberal Democratic Party members, they have all participated in the struggle committee, and they stand shoulder to shoulder on the front lines of the struggle. Poor peasants, middle peasants, rich peasants, workers, merchants, and intellectuals throughout the town are united in the "Anti-Alliance," forming a powerful force against the expansion of the U.S. military base and defending their homes.
    The Japanese government authorities' creation of this bloody incident immediately aroused great anger among the Japanese public. The Japanese Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and local residents lodged strong protests with the Japanese government. The various Japanese parties and groups supporting Sunagawa Town also demonstrated a spirit of unity. Before this bloody incident occurred, they held a "Joint Struggle Conference." Participants included representatives from the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, and workers, students, women, peace organizations, as well as the New Japan Medical Association, the Japan Cultural Circle Base Problem Roundtable, and the Japan Journalists Conference, totaling twenty organizations. They unanimously passed a resolution to establish the "Sunagawa Town Support Group Liaison Conference." Therefore, the struggle of the residents of Sunagawa Town cannot be seen as a local, accidental event, but as a struggle by the Japanese people against the U.S. military occupation policy and to safeguard national territorial sovereignty and national peace and security.
    The Japanese government authorities, disregarding the national crisis and succumbing to the U.S. policy of expanding military bases, are actually willing to inflict such harm on their own people, which is truly disgraceful. The general trend of the world has long shown that the U.S. war policy is unpopular; if the Japanese government authorities do not change course and continue to blindly follow the U.S., it will only become more isolated among the Japanese people. Complying with the legitimate demands of the Japanese people and stopping the implementation of the U.S. military base expansion plan in Japan is what a government that values public opinion should do.

    日本人民保卫土地和主权的英勇行动
    裴达
    10月12日和13日，日本政府当局屈从美国的压力，强制测量砂川町居民的土地来扩大美国立川空军基地，竟对当地居民使用武力，打伤了砂川町居民一千多人。日本人民的鲜血染红了他们誓死保卫的土地，表现了英勇不屈的斗争意志。
    东京都砂川町居民反对扩大美国空军基地的斗争，是在去年春天美国军事当局和日本政府决定要扩建五个飞机场（立川、横田、木更津、新潟、小牧）之后被迫展开的。砂川町居民认为，如果扩大美国空军基地，让美国装载原子弹的飞机在日本土地上起落，不仅要使自己丧失家园和土地，更严重的是威胁着日本的和平安全。因此，一年半以来，砂川町居民在全国工人、学生和文化界的支援下，英勇地坚持斗争反对扩大立川美军基地。日本官方测量队虽然几次去测量，都遭到砂川町居民的坚决反抗，使美国扩充基地的计划，始终未能顺利进行。过去砂川町的居民就曾坚决表示：“木桩打不进我们的心，也让它打不进土地里去！”这次事件发生后，砂川町町长宫崎在群众大会上说，砂川町居民决心反抗政府的镇压，宁愿被压路机辗死，也不让他们夺走土地。这说明砂川町居民保卫自己家园和土地主权的英勇气概。
    砂川町居民的斗争，已经成为目前日本全国人民保卫土地和主权的一面光辉的旗帜。这个斗争给其他基地的居民作出了榜样，鼓舞着日本全国人民的斗争勇气和信心。砂川町居民在斗争中表现得这样英勇和顽强，主要是他们具有团结一致的决心，始终不为暴力所屈服。在砂川町议会中，以町长和议长为首，不论是社会党或是自由民主党的议员，都参加了斗争委员会，而且他们肩并肩地站在斗争最前线。全町的贫农、中农、富农和工人、商人、知识分子都团结在“反对同盟”里面，组成了一支反对扩大美军基地、保卫家园的强大力量。
    日本政府当局制造这次流血事件，立即引起了日本公众对它的极大愤怒。日本社会党、共产党和当地居民，向日本政府提出了强硬的抗议。支援砂川町的日本各党派和团体，也表现了团结一致的精神。在这次发生流血事件之前，他们举行了“共同斗争会议”。参加会议的有社会党、共产党、劳农党和工人、学生、妇女、和平组织，以及新日本医师协会、日本文化界基地问题恳谈会和日本新闻工作者会议等二十个团体的代表。他们一致通过决议，成立“砂川町支援团体联络会议”。因此，砂川町居民的斗争，不能看成是一个地方的偶然发生的事件，而是日本全国人民反对美国军事占领政策，维护国家领土主权和国家和平安全的斗争。
    日本政府当局不顾民族危机，屈从美国扩充军事基地的政策，竟忍心向它自己的人民下此毒手，实在是很不体面的事。世界大势早已表明，美国战争政策是不得人心的；日本政府当局如果不改弦易辙，继续追随美国蛮干下去，只会使它在日本人民中更加孤立。顺从日本人民的正当要求，停止执行美国在日本扩充军事基地计划，这才是以民意为重的政府所应该作的事情。
