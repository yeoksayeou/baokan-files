Facing the Palace of Knowledge
——A Record of the National Exhibition of Scientific and Technological Popularization for Workers
Cai Jianyuan

　　“Knowledge is power” six large characters stand erect in front of the venue of the National Exhibition of Scientific and Technological Popularization for Workers. This exhibition opened on October 25th at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace. Stepping into the exhibition, one will immediately receive vivid and concrete confirmation that humanity has accumulated rich knowledge in the struggle for production, and this knowledge has given humanity unparalleled power. Today, we are fully utilizing this power in production practice.

　　What does the "integrated iron and steel enterprise" being built in our country look like? From a three-dimensional chart in the Industrial Technology Hall of the exhibition, one can see that it will be densely covered with pipelines for railway, mixed gas, blast furnace gas, and coke oven gas equipment, composed of more than thirty factory buildings. The complete automation of factories is not a fantasy but an imminent reality. A clear chart tells the audience that a factory, from the operation of machine tools to the packaging of finished products, can be completely automated through nearly twenty processes. Underground coal mining is very arduous labor. Is it possible to extract coal without going underground? The great Russian scientist proposed the ideal of underground coal gasification in the nineteenth century. Now, the Soviet Union has established several experimental underground coal gasification stations. A chart tells the audience that the coal gasification station is actually a factory, with tunnels leading to the underground, and a row of tall factory buildings built on the ground, with several rows of pipes leading to the coal area. Compressed air is sent from the factory to the underground, and the air penetrates the coal seam, causing incomplete combustion of the coal, thus turning the coal into combustible gas, which is discharged from the boreholes to the gasification station. After cooling, desulfurization, and drying, it can be directly sent to the user. The northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the major artery connecting southwest and northwest China, from Yangjiawan to Qinling, is extremely difficult to construct because of the particularly steep terrain, complex geology, and winding routes, forming "light bulb," "double horseshoe," and "inverted 8" detours. Tunnels are connected and account for more than 56% of the total length of the line. The scientific and technological knowledge of our railway workers overcame these difficulties, enabling this section of the line to be completed and opened to traffic ahead of schedule this spring. A huge electric model displayed here clearly presents this section of the line to the audience. The Industrial Technology Hall shows that scientific and technological knowledge is changing the face of the machinery industry, metallurgical industry, fuel industry, post and telecommunications, railway transportation, construction engineering, and geological engineering in a rapidly changing way.

　　In fact, the power of human scientific and technological knowledge has gone far beyond this. The progress of human science and technology closely follows humanity's endless ideals. The New Achievements in Science and Technology Hall of the exhibition uses a series of pictures, models, and objects to show the audience that humanity has entered the atomic energy era, but the principles and applications of atomic energy can be understood in a popular way; humanity has entered a strange era, but those strange things can also be understood in a popular way. If someone asks, can we fly out of the earth and visit other planets? The answer is yes. As long as we fly fast enough to overcome the Earth's attraction to us, we can realize the ideal of space travel. Now, the tools for mankind to achieve space travel are rocket ships and artificial satellites. Space travelers will tell people that their journey is like this: They ride in a rocket ship and fly high, with increasing speed. When they reach 11.2 kilometers per second, they break free from the Earth's gravity and fly out of the Earth. When they reach outer space and are no longer subject to the Earth's gravity, everything inside the rocket ship loses weight, cups, utensils, and people float up, and even water condenses into floating water droplets of different sizes. The first destination for travelers is the moon, because it is the closest; from the window, they can see the moon getting closer and closer. When they reach the moon, travelers wear masks and respirators because there is no air or water there; and precisely because of this, the temperature there varies greatly, and they must wear special clothing that is both cold-proof and heat-resistant. Old home Earth appears far away in the starry sky. Travelers then proceed to Mars, and they rest on a small satellite of Mars, 20,000 kilometers away from Mars, but the oases, snow, etc. on Mars can already be seen. Is there life on Mars? Travelers will conduct a practical investigation to uncover its secrets, and perhaps they will find some interesting plants on the red soil of Mars. On the way to Saturn, travelers will see the magnificent scene of the huge Saturn rising from the horizon from one of its satellites. After the high development of space navigation science, travelers will be able to fly faster and farther, and they can fly to other solar systems.

　　This is what the New Achievements in Science and Technology Hall of the exhibition introduces to the audience. The New Achievements in Science and Technology Hall also introduces to the audience the basic principles and applications of new achievements in semiconductors, electronic computers, radio electronics, ultrasonic waves, and jet technology. Real objects such as jet engines, semiconductor radios, and televisions, as well as models of artificial satellites, rockets, and missiles, can also be seen here.

　　This is truly a palace of knowledge.
　　This makes the power of mankind to conquer nature endless, and the increase of human happiness also endless.
　　However, "There is no smooth road in science, and only those who climb the rugged path without fear of hardship can hope to reach the glorious peak" (Marx). The Natural Science Hall of the exhibition tells the audience that previous scientific workers have traveled a difficult path on rugged roads, so that mankind has the great power to conquer nature. These past journeys are still vivid in people's minds. From the Natural Science Hall, it can be seen that the research results in physics, chemistry, biology, or astronomy have provided rich and necessary conditions for mankind to understand the laws of natural phenomena. Any latest and greatest achievement in science and technology is also developed on the basis of this knowledge. The electrical part of physics conducts experiments for the audience, and electricity is very easy to understand; the currents of various energy sources and the various effects of current do not seem complicated. It is these simple things that are inseparable from today's highly developed electronics. People feel comfortable in handling wood, ore, salt, coal, petroleum, etc. in daily life because they have mastered the laws of chemical changes in these things. What is a cold wave and what is a typhoon? People can fully understand.

　　This is also a palace of knowledge.
　　Facing the palace of knowledge, the determination of the workers is: to advance towards science. The general hall of the exhibition introduces to the audience that in order to meet this need, scientific workers organized the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization as early as 1950; now, except for Tibet and Taiwan, 27 branches have been established in provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, and more than 600 branches have been established in counties and cities, and members' working groups have been established in nearly 3,000 factories, mines, institutions, and schools. More than 110,000 members are united in the association's organization. The association mainly adopts lectures to carry out scientific and technological popularization work, and has held more than 90,000 lectures in the past six years; other oral propaganda methods include broadcasting, question-and-answer sessions, and symposiums. These activities have laid the foundation for workers to learn scientific and technological knowledge and have directly promoted production. When the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant promoted corn milling cutters, association members specially explained the principle and characteristics of corn milling cutters, helping the smooth promotion of this milling cutter in the factory. Miller Su Guangming also created a slice milling cutter according to its principle, increasing production efficiency by more than three times. A series of pictures in the general hall of the exhibition introduces these activities. Scientific popularization pamphlets, periodicals, scientific propaganda boxes (referred to as science popularization boxes), scientific films, and slides are also displayed here. The enthusiasm of workers to learn scientific and technological knowledge is rising, and the ranks of scientific and technological workers will become stronger.

　　The workers deeply understand that knowledge is power. On the road to advancing towards science, they will become a strong force and make arduous struggles to promote production and capture scientific fortresses. (Picture)

    面对着知识之宫
    ——记全国职工科学技术普及工作展览会
    蔡鉴远
    “知识就是力量”六个大字耸立在全国职工科学技术普及工作展览会会场的前面。10月25日这个展览会在北京市劳动人民文化宫开幕了。一走进展览会，人们会立刻得到生动而具体的证实，人类在生产斗争中积累了丰富的知识，这些知识给了人类无可比拟的力量。今天我们在生产实践中正充分地发挥着这种力量。
    我们国家正在兴建的“钢铁联合企业”是什么样的？从展览会工业技术馆的一幅立体图表上可以看到，它将密布着铁路、混合煤气、高炉煤气以及焦炉煤气设备的管道，由三十多座厂房组成。工厂的全部自动化不是幻想，而是即将实现的事实，一幅清晰的图表告诉观众，一个工厂从机床的运转到成品的包装，当中经过近二十道工序，都可以完全自动化。井下采煤是很繁重的劳动。不到地下去而可以把煤采掘出来，可能吗？俄国伟大科学家在十九世纪就提出了煤的地下气化的理想。现在苏联已经建立了几个实验性的煤的地下气化站。一个图表告诉观众，煤的气化站实际是一个工厂，它设有通往地下的巷道，在地面建有一排排的高大厂房，厂房里又有几排管子通到煤区。从厂房向地下输送压缩空气，空气穿透煤层引起煤的不完全燃烧，因而把煤变成可燃性瓦斯从钻孔排出到气化站，经过冷却、脱硫、干燥以后，就可以直接送到用户。连接我国西南、西北间的大动脉宝成铁路的北段杨家湾到秦岭间的工程极为艰巨，因为地势特别险峻，地质复杂，路线盘旋曲折，构成“电灯泡”、“双马蹄”、“反8字形”等迂回线路，隧道并连，占线路总长56％以上。我国铁路职工的科学技术知识战胜了这些困难，使这段线路在今年春天提前竣工通车。陈列在这里的一个巨大电动模型，它把这一段线路清楚地呈现在观众眼前。工业技术馆显示，科学技术知识使人们日新月异地改变着机械工业、冶金工业、燃料工业、邮电、铁道运输、建筑工程和地质工程等方面的面貌。
    其实，人类科学技术知识的力量已经远不止于此。人类科学技术的进展，紧紧追随着人类无穷尽的理想。展览会的科学技术新成就馆，用一系列的图片、模型和实物向观众显示，人类进入了原子能时代，但原子能的原理和应用，是可以通俗地理解的；人类进入了一个奇异的时代，但那些奇异的事物，也是可以通俗地理解的。如果有人问，我们能不能飞出地球去，到别的星球上观光一番？回答是肯定的。只要我们飞得快，能够克制地球对我们的吸引力，就可以实现宇宙航行的理想。现在，人类实现宇宙航行的工具是火箭船和人造卫星。宇宙旅行家们将会告诉人们，他们一路的情景是这样的：他们乘着火箭船高高地飞起了，飞行速度越来越大。当达到每秒钟十一点二公里的时候，他们就摔脱掉地心吸力，飞出地球去了。到了宇宙空间，再不受到地球引力的作用时，火箭船内的东西都失去了重量，茶杯、用具以及人都飘起来，连水也凝聚成大小不同的飘着的水珠。旅行家们的第一个目标是月球，因为它离得最近；从窗口已经可以看到越来越近的月球。到月球上，旅行家们带上面罩和呼吸器，因为那里没有空气和水；也正因为这样，那里的温度相差悬殊，必需穿着特备的既防寒又耐热的衣服。老家地球，远远地出现在星空。旅行家们再向火星前进，他们停留在火星的一个小小卫星上休息，离火星还有二万公里，但火星上的绿洲、白雪等等，已经可以看到了。火星上有没有生命？旅行家将去作一番实际考察，揭开它的秘密，也许他们在火星的红色土地上将可以找到一些有趣的植物。在飞向土星的途程中，旅行家们从它的一个卫星上将可以看到巨大的土星从地平线升起的壮丽景象。宇宙航行科学的高度发达以后，旅行家们将可以飞得更快更远，可以飞到别的太阳系去。
    这是展览会的科学技术新成就馆向观众介绍的。科学技术新成就馆还向观众介绍了半导体、电子计算机、无线电电子学、超声波、喷气技术等方面新成就的基本原理和应用。喷气发动机、半导体收音机、电视机等实物，人造卫星、火箭、导弹等的模型，也可以在这里看到。
    这真是知识之宫。
    这使得人类征服自然的力量无穷无尽，人类幸福的增进也无穷无尽。
    但是，“在科学上面是没有平坦大路可走的，只有那在崎岖小路的攀登上不畏劳苦的人，有希望到达光辉的顶点”（马克思）。展览会的自然科学馆告诉观众，前辈科学工作者们在崎岖小路上走过了艰苦的途程，以致人类有了伟大的征服自然的力量。这些以往的途程还让人们历历可见。从自然科学馆里可以看到，不论物理学、化学、生物学、或天文学方面的研究成果，都为人类的认识自然现象的规律提供了丰富的必要的条件。科学技术上的任何最新最大的成就也都是在这些知识的基础上发展起来的。物理学的电学部分做实验给观众看，电是极容易认识的；各种能源的电流和电流的各种效应，看起来也并不复杂。就是这些简单的东西，同今天高度发展的电子学也是不可分的。人们在日常生活中对木料、矿石、盐、煤、石油等的处理，感到很顺手，就因为人们掌握了这些东西的化学变化的规律。寒潮，台风是怎么回事？人们完全可以理解。
    这也是知识之宫。
    面对着知识之宫，职工们的决心是：向科学进军。展览会的总馆向观众介绍，为了适应这种需要，科学工作者们远在1950年就组织了中华全国科学技术普及协会；现在除了西藏和台湾以外，各省、市、自治区共成立了二十七个分会，县、市共成立了六百多个支会，在将近三千个厂矿、机关和学校里成立了会员工作组。团结在协会组织里的会员有十一万多人。协会进行科学技术普及工作，主要采取讲演方式，六年来共举办了讲演九万多次；其他有广播、问题解答、座谈会等口头宣传方式。这些活动为职工的学习科学技术知识打下了基础，并且直接对生产起了推进作用。哈尔滨机车车辆修理厂推广玉米铣刀的时候，协会会员特地讲解了玉米铣刀的原理和特点，帮助这种铣刀在厂中顺利地得到推广。铣工苏广铭还按照它的原理创造了片铣刀，提高生产效率达三倍以上。展览会总馆的一系列图片介绍了这些活动情况。这里还陈列有科学普及小册子、期刊、科学宣传箱（简称科普箱）、科学影片和幻灯片等。职工们努力学习科学技术的热情正在高涨，科学技术工作者的队伍将更加壮大起来。
    职工们深刻领会，知识就是力量。在向科学进军的道路上，他们将成为一支劲旅，为推进生产、为占领科学堡垒作艰巨的斗争。（图片）
