Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, October 4th: The Eighth Session of the Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions passed a general resolution: "Take measures to meet the economic and social demands of the working people and develop new forces conducive to the realization of the unity of the world trade union movement."

The resolution said that the Eighth Session of the Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions confirms that, in order to achieve the goals of the working class, the unity of action of all working people and the cooperation between trade union organizations are the most important and urgent issues currently facing the international trade union movement.

The resolution stated that in the modern world, the role of the constantly growing working class in the political and economic life of various countries is becoming increasingly important. Trade union organizations everywhere are exerting an increasing influence on the resolution of major issues in social life. Life itself unequivocally presents an important fact: the working people of all countries have common and vital interests that are important to them. If the trade unions of various countries defend these common interests of the working people in concert, then they can become a more effective force. When trade unions are united, they will have a decisive influence and can achieve the purpose of resolving fundamental current issues in the interests of the working people.

The resolution said that the Council believes that there are currently more favorable conditions than ever before for all working people to take concerted action and for trade unions of all countries, without exception, to cooperate nationally or internationally. Regarding this point, the resolution pointed out that the international working class has already deeply felt the fatal consequences of the split in the trade union movement and is therefore firmly striving for unity. On the other hand, the balance of world forces has undergone fundamental changes. Socialism has gone beyond the scope of one country and has become a world system. A broad zone of peace has been established. Relations between countries with different social systems have tended to ease. This has opened the way for the improvement of international trade union relations, the new development of unified action, and cooperation between trade unions.

The increasingly wide spread of socialist ideology, further exploration of the issue of different paths to socialism, and the unified will of the working people to strive for social progress, have created favorable conditions for contact and mutual discussion among activists of different factions of the trade union movement, and for the unity of all working people.

The tremendous upsurge in the struggles of various countries under a unified banner is also a characteristic of the current period. In this struggle, the working people are more clearly aware of the necessity of concerted action. Leaders of trade unions of various tendencies often meet to discuss issues together. Therefore, the prospect of realizing the unity of the trade union movement has become closer and more realistic. The greatly developed movement of exchanging delegations between countries has also created a more friendly atmosphere in international trade union relations, which is increasingly frequently leading to agreements that promote the unity of trade unions' actions and the cause of international workers' solidarity. In addition, the common vote of labor representatives on issues such as shortening working hours, implementing automation, and equal pay for equal work at the 39th session of the International Labor Organization also proves that, under more decisive circumstances, it is possible to achieve concerted action.

The resolution continued, however, the Council also considered the obstacles in the way of unity. It regrets that the leadership of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions has passed anti-democratic resolutions in an attempt to use them to prohibit organizations participating in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions from making any contact with trade unions in socialist countries participating in the World Federation of Trade Unions, and constantly conducts propaganda hostile to our organization. This position is neither in line with the wishes of the working people nor in line with the interests of the working people.

The resolution said that the World Federation of Trade Unions Council emphasizes that the progress of concerted action is largely related to the work of formulating legitimate demands and practical combat forms under the conditions of observing trade union democracy. These demands and combat forms can promote the unity of the working people in the struggle to defend their economic and social interests in the struggle for peace, freedom, and national independence of all peoples.

Socialist countries have made great achievements in raising the living standards of the working people. Trade union organizations have played a primary role in realizing these positive measures that benefit the working people. However, the trade unions of socialist countries are not satisfied with the achievements already made. They are taking measures to overcome shortcomings and further improve the working and living conditions of the working people.

In capitalist countries, production growth in recent years has been unbalanced. Under the influence of unhealthy phenomena such as economic militarization or other temporary factors, this growth has only brought benefits to capitalists and monopoly organizations, while bringing constant attacks on their living standards and working conditions to the working people. In order to oppose this attack, and considering the increasingly strengthened and effective resistance of the working people, the Council believes that the unity of action of the working people and trade unions of various tendencies is absolutely necessary in order to satisfy the demands of various trade union organizations that have been announced to increase wages, shorten working hours, oppose the harmful consequences of automation on the living and working conditions of the working people, implement the principle of "equal pay for equal work," respect trade union rights and democratic freedoms, and so on.

The resolution said that after analyzing the international situation, it is also possible to find other bases and common goals for the unified action and cooperation of various trade union organizations. These common goals are: to strive for disarmament and easing of international tensions, to strive for the prohibition of testing atomic weapons and to declare atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons illegal, to fight against the rearmament of West Germany; the peoples of oppressed or recently independent countries are fighting for their independence and consolidating their independence; fighting for the development of friendly relations and cooperation between the peoples of all countries.

The resolution said that only with the strength of the entire trade union movement can progress be guaranteed in achieving unity, and can all existing obstacles on the road forward be gradually eliminated. The World Federation of Trade Unions and various trade union internationals should play a leading role in the struggle to strive for concerted action by the working people and to strive for cooperation between countries at a higher level that meets the requirements of the current situation. In this regard, the World Federation of Trade Unions calls on the masses of working people and trade unions to display the spirit of international solidarity, and without exception, support all working people and trade union organizations that are struggling to improve living and working conditions and to strive for national independence and peace; provide timely and necessary assistance to working people and trade unions struggling against colonial oppression; better publicize their programs and activities among the working people of various countries; do everything possible to promote the industrialization of underdeveloped countries, maintain their independence, better utilize all existing possibilities to expand their activities, send delegations to various countries as much as possible, or receive delegations from trade unions of various tendencies.

The resolution concluded by saying that the World Federation of Trade Unions Council believes that it is acting in accordance with the ardent wishes of all working people, and it hopes that all trade union organizations, whether participating or not participating in the World Federation of Trade Unions, will take all measures to ensure unity. This is the road to broadly developing international workers' solidarity, expanding the unity of action of all working people, and cooperation between trade unions, and it is also the guarantee for future victories in the struggle for peace, freedom, and social progress.

    世界工联理事会第八次会议总决议
    强调全体劳动人民的行动一致和工会组织之间的合作
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社索非亚4日讯：世界工会联合国理事会第八次会议通过了总决议：“采取措施以满足劳动人民的经济和社会要求，发展有利于实现世界工会运动的团结的新力量”。
    决议说，世界工会联合会理事会第八次会议确认，为了达到工人阶级的目的，全体劳动人民的行动一致、工会组织之间的合作是目前国际工会运动面临的最重要的和刻不容缓的问题。
    决议说，在现代世界上，人数在不断增长的工人阶级在各国政治和经济生活中所起的作用越来越大。工会组织到处都在对社会生活中的主要问题的解决起着越来越大的影响。生活本身确定不移地提出了一个重要的事实，就是各国劳动人民有着对他们重要的共同的切身利益。如果各国工会协同一致地捍卫这些劳动人民的共同利益，那么它们就可以成为更加有效的力量。工会团结一致，它就会有决定性的影响并且可以根据劳动人民的利益达到解决当前的基本问题的目的。
    决议说，理事会认为，对所有劳动人民采取一致行动以及各国工会毫无例外地在全国范围内或国际范围中实行合作来说，目前有着比过去任何时候更加有利的条件。关于这一点，决议指出，目前国际工人阶级已经切身体会到了工会运动分裂的致命后果，因此坚定地力求团结。另一方面，世界力量的对比已经起了根本的变化。社会主义已经越出了一个国家的范围而变成了世界体系。一个广阔的和平地区建立起来了。不同社会制度的国家关系已经趋向和缓。这就为国际工会关系的改善，统一行动的新发展和各工会之间的合作开辟了道路。
    社会主义思想越来越广泛的传播，对过渡到社会主义的不同道路问题的进一步探讨以及劳动人民争取社会进步的统一意志，为不同派别工会运动的积极分子之间的接触和互相讨论、为全体劳动人民的团结创造了有利条件。
    各国的斗争在统一旗帜下有了巨大的高涨，这也是当前时期的一个特点。在这一斗争中劳动人民更清楚地意识到行动一致的必要性。各种倾向的工会领导人常常聚会共同讨论问题。因此实现工会运动的团结的前景已经更加接近、更加现实了。互派代表团的运动在各国的大大发展也在国际工会关系中造成更加友好的气氛，它越来越频繁地导致许多推动工会的行动的团结和国际工人大团结的事业的协议。此外，劳动人民代表在国际劳工组织第三十九次会议上对缩短工作时间、实行自动化、男女同工同酬等问题上的共同投票也证明，在更加具有决定性的情况下，实现行动一致是可能的。
    决议接着说，然而，理事会也考虑到横在团结的道路上的障碍。它感到遗憾的是：国际自由工会联合会的领导通过了反民主的决议，企图用它来禁止参加国际自由工会联合会的组织来同参加世界工会联合会的社会主义国家的工会进行一切接触，并且不断地进行敌视我们组织的宣传。这种立场既不符合劳动人民的愿望，也不符合劳动人民的利益。
    决议说，世界工联理事会着重指出，行动一致的进展，在很大程度上是同在遵守工会民主的条件下拟定正当的要求和符合实际可能性的战斗形式的工作有关的，这种要求和战斗形式能够促使劳动人民团结起来，在为争取和平、自由和各国人民的民族独立的斗争中保卫自己的经济和社会利益。
    社会主义国家在提高劳动人民群众的生活水平方面取得了很大的成就。在实现这些有利于劳动人民的积极措施方面，工会组织起了首要的作用。然而，社会主义国家的工会并不满足于已经取得的成就。它们正在采取措施以求克服缺点，进一步改善劳动人民的劳动和生活条件。
    在资本主义国家中，最近几年的生产增长是不平衡的。在经济军事化这样一些不健康的现象或是其他一些暂时性的因素的影响下，这种增长只给资本家和垄断组织带来了益处，而给劳动人民带来的是对他们的生活水平和劳动条件的经常进攻。为了反对这一进攻，以及考虑到劳动人民日益加强的和有效的反抗，理事会认为，劳动人民和各种倾向的工会的行动团结是绝对必须的，这样才能使各种工会组织所宣布的增加工资、缩短工作时间、反对自动化对劳动人民生活条件和劳动条件的有害的后果，贯彻“同工同酬”的原则、尊重工会权利和民主自由等等要求得到满足。
    决议说，分析一下国际局势之后，还可以为各工会组织的一致行动和合作找到其他一些基础和共同的奋斗目标。这些共同的目标是：为争取裁军和缓和国际紧张局势、争取禁止试验原子武器并宣布原子武器和氢武器为非法、反对重新武装西德而斗争；被压迫的或是最近才获得独立的各国人民为争取自己的独立和巩固自己的独立而斗争；为发展各国人民之间的友好联系和合作而斗争。
    决议说，只有靠整个工会运动的力量，才能保证在实现团结一致方面取得进展，才能逐步消除前进道路上现有的一切障碍。世界工会联合会和各工会国际应当在争取劳动人民行动一致和争取各国工会在符合目前情势的要求的更高水平上进行合作的斗争中起领导作用。在这一方面，世界工联号召劳动人民群众和工会发挥国际团结的精神，毫无例外地支持一切为改善生活和劳动条件、为争取民族独立与和平而奋斗的劳动人民和工会组织；及时地给予为反对殖民主义压迫而斗争的劳动人民和工会必要的帮助；更好地在各国劳动人民中宣传自己的纲领和活动；尽一切可能促进不发达国家的工业化，维护它们的独立，更好地利用现有的一切可能展开自己的活动，尽可能地派遣代表团前往各国、或是接受各种倾向的工会代表团。
    决议最后说，世界工联理事会相信它是根据全体劳动人民的热烈愿望行动的，它希望无论是参加、或是没有参加世界工联的一切工会组织采取一切措施，以保障团结。这就是广泛发展国际工人大团结、扩大全体劳动人民的行动一致和各工会之间的合作的道路，也就是争取和平、自由和社会进步的斗争获得未来胜利的保证。
