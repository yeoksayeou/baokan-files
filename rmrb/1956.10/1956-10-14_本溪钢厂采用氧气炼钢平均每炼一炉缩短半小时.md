Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, 10th October: Since the beginning of October, Benxi Steel Plant has been using oxygen in all its steelmaking furnaces, reducing the smelting time by an average of 30 minutes per furnace. Now, the time saved from smelting seven or eight furnaces is enough to smelt one more furnace.
    In the past, Benxi Steel Plant used bottled oxygen for oxygen steelmaking, which resulted in high costs and an insufficient supply of oxygen. Recently, the expansion of the Benxi Iron and Steel Company's oxygen plant was completed, and at the beginning of October, it began to directly supply oxygen to the Benxi Steel Plant through pipelines, ensuring an adequate supply of oxygen during steelmaking.

    本溪钢厂采用氧气炼钢平均每炼一炉缩短半小时
    新华社本溪10日电　本溪钢厂从10月初起在全部炼钢炉上采用氧气炼钢，每炉钢的冶炼时间平均缩短了三十分钟。现在，每炼七、八炉钢节省下来的时间，就可以多炼出一炉钢。
    本溪钢厂过去是用一瓶瓶散装的氧气来进行氧气炼钢的，因此成本较高，氧气供应量也不足。最近，本溪钢铁公司氧气厂扩建完工，在10月初开始通过管道，直接把氧气输送到本溪钢厂，使炼钢时得到充足的氧气。
