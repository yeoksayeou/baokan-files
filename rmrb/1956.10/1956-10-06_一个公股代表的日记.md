Editor's Note: Published here is a section of the diary of Yue Yuhua, the public share representative of the Xuanzhuang Public-Private Joint State-Owned Pharmaceutical Store in Fengrun County, Hebei Province. Yue Yuhua was dispatched by the Xuanzhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative as a public share representative, but he is frequently assigned to other tasks and unable to handle his official duties. This practice is highly inappropriate. We hope the relevant departments will pay attention to it and correct it.

    August 7th It has been several months since I was assigned to be a "public share representative," but I can't even figure out how many days I've actually worked as a public share representative.
    August 8th Made a report to the county on the supply and marketing cooperative's private transformation team.
    August 9th Compiled forms for the supply and marketing cooperative's private transformation team to comprehensively investigate small vendors.
    August 10th Handled store affairs.
    August 11th Handled store affairs in the morning. In the afternoon, the supply and marketing cooperative transferred me to the district office to sort out archives until late at night.
    August 13th Yesterday and today, I continued to sort out archives at the district office until late at night.
    August 14th Handled store matters in the morning. In the afternoon, I organized request materials for the supply and marketing cooperative's private transformation team.
    August 15th Sorted out materials for the supply and marketing cooperative's private transformation team in the morning, and was sent by the private transformation team to various distribution stores to investigate the situation of slow-moving, out-of-stock, and supply of goods. In the afternoon, I returned to the supply and marketing cooperative to assist in making supply, retail, and wholesale plans until 11 p.m.
    August 16th Went to the supply and marketing cooperative to complete the work that was not finished yesterday, and did not finish until dark.
    August 17th Handled the store's financial work.
    August 18th Went to the supply and marketing cooperative to make a supply plan. I heard that it will not be completed until the 21st, and I don't know what they will draw me to do next.

    一个公股代表的日记
    编者按：这里发表的是河北省丰润县宣庄公私合营国药店公股代表岳玉华的一段日记。岳玉华是宣庄供销合作社派出的公股代表，但是他却经常被派去作另外的工作，不能办理职务内的工作。这种作法是十分不妥当的。希望有关部门予以注意和纠正。
    8月7日　被派来当“公股代表”，已经几个月了，究竟自己干了几天公股代表的事，连自己也弄不清。
    8月8日　给供销社私改组作向县里的汇报。
    8月9日为供销社私改组综合调查小商贩的表格。
    8月10日　处理店内事务。
    8月11日　午前处理店内事务。午后供销社抽调我到区公所清理档案到夜深。
    8月13日　昨天和今天，仍然继续到区公所清理档案，直到夜深。
    8月14日　午前处理本店事宜。午后给供销社私改组整理请示材料。
    8月15日　午前给供销社私改组整理材料，被私改组派到各分销店调查库存商品冷滞、脱销和供应情况。午后回供销社协助作供应、零售、批发计划，到夜十一点。
    8月16日　到供销社作昨天未完成的工作，天黑才结束。
    8月17日　处理本店财务工作。
    8月18日　到供销社作货源计划，听说要到二十一日才能完成，不知以后还要抽我干些什么。
