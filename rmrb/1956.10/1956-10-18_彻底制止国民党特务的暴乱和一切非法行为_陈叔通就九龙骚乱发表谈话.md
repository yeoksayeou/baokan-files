Xinhua News Agency, October 17th: Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, issued a statement today regarding the riots created by Kuomintang secret agents in Kowloon. The full text is as follows:

    The large-scale riots created by Kuomintang secret agents in Kowloon are heinous crimes of robbery and murder against our Kowloon compatriots, arousing immense indignation from the industrial and commercial circles nationwide. I express a serious protest to the British authorities in Hong Kong for failing to take effective measures to stop the riots in a timely manner and extend sincere condolences to the Kowloon compatriots who have suffered enormous losses in life and property.

    The vast majority of residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon are Chinese compatriots engaged in industrial and commercial enterprises. They have played a significant role in promoting the prosperity of Hong Kong and Kowloon's economy, facilitating import and export trade, supplying residents with daily necessities, and facilitating transportation. They are an indispensable force for the prosperity of Hong Kong and Kowloon. The British authorities in Hong Kong have an absolute responsibility to protect them. However, the British authorities in Hong Kong neither took preventive measures beforehand, nor did they promptly stop the riots afterward, allowing factories and shops to be burned and looted, and residents to be murdered, leaving more than two million residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon in a state of extreme terror. This is not only an abandonment of the due responsibility to protect residents but also an extremely unfriendly attitude towards the Chinese people. I believe that the British authorities in Hong Kong should be held responsible for compensating the enormous losses of life and property suffered by the residents of Kowloon.

    Now, although martial law has been lifted in the Kowloon area, a large number of Kuomintang secret agents are still scattered throughout Hong Kong and Kowloon, and residents' lives and property are still under serious threat at any time. I demand that the British authorities in Hong Kong should learn from this riot incident, actively assume their due responsibilities, thoroughly stop the riots and all illegal activities of Kuomintang secret agents, arrest the ringleaders of the riots, punish them according to law, and ensure that such incidents do not happen again in the future.

    彻底制止国民党特务的暴乱和一切非法行为
    陈叔通就九龙骚乱发表谈话
    新华社17日讯　中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通今天就国民党特务分子在九龙制造暴乱事发表谈话。全文如下：
    国民党特务分子在九龙制造的大规模的暴乱，是劫杀九龙同胞的滔天罪行，引起了全国工商界的无比愤慨。我对没有及时采取有效措施制止暴乱的香港英国当局表示严重的抗议，对生命财产遭受巨大损失的九龙同胞致以亲切的慰问。
    香港九龙的居民绝大多数是经营工商企业的中国同胞。他们对于繁荣港九经济，沟通进出口贸易，供应居民日用品以及便利交通运输等方面起了很大的作用，作出了有益的贡献。他们是港九繁荣所不可缺少的巨大力量。香港英国当局对他们负有绝对保护的责任。但是，香港英国当局事前既未防患于未然，事后对暴乱又未及时加以制止，听任工厂商店被烧劫，居民被凶杀，使港九二百多万居民陷于极端恐怖的状态之中。这不仅是放弃对居民应有的保护责任，而且是对中国人民极不友好的态度。我认为香港英国当局对九龙居民生命财产所遭受的巨大损失，应负有赔偿之责。
    现在，九龙地区虽已解除戒严，但大批国民党特务分子还散布在港九，居民的生命财产还随时受到严重的威胁。我要求香港英国当局应从这次暴乱事件中吸取教训，积极负起应有的责任，彻底制止国民党特务分子的暴乱和一切非法行为，逮捕暴乱祸首，依法惩办，并保证以后不再有此类事件发生。
