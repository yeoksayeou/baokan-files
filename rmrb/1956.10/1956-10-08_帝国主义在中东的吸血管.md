    Imperialism's Suction Tubes in the Middle East

　　The Middle East, mainly the area along the Persian Gulf, is the world's largest oil reserve area. According to the 1955 estimate, the Middle East's oil reserves are 16.635 billion tons, accounting for 64.6% of the world's total reserves.

　　However, the Middle East's oil has not become the wealth of the people of the Middle Eastern countries. Since the 20th century, it has become the object of plunder by Western colonial countries. In the last thirty years, the oil seized by imperialism from the Middle East has increased from 5 million tons per year to 162 million tons per year.

　　In order to plunder oil, imperialism has built ports and laid oil pipelines in the Middle East. Four huge long-distance oil pipelines pass through the territories of Arab countries, directly connecting to the Mediterranean Sea. These pipelines act like suction tubes, transporting oil to the West.

　　The main oil pipelines in the Middle East belong to the Iraq Petroleum Company and the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company (Tapline) – an affiliate of the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco).

　　The Iraq Petroleum Company, mainly funded by British capital, monopolizes almost all of Iraq's oil. In 1955, it plundered 34 million tons of oil from Iraq. Except for a small portion of crude oil that is piped to Iran for refining, the vast majority is transported to the Mediterranean coast through pipelines. Last year, the Iraq Petroleum Company transported more than 30 million tons of oil through pipelines. Pipeline transportation provides even greater profits for imperialism, saving $0.27 per barrel (approximately 135 kilograms) compared to sea transportation, which is an extra profit. Therefore, in the last year alone, the Iraq Petroleum Company earned approximately $60 million in extra profits.

　　The Iraq Petroleum Company originally had three pipelines. Two started from Kirkuk, the oil production center of Iraq, passed through Syria, and ended at the port of Tripoli in Lebanon for export. These two parallel pipelines started transporting oil in 1934 and 1949 respectively, with a total length of 851.2 kilometers. One pipeline has a diameter of 30.48 centimeters, and the other has a diameter of 40.64 centimeters. The third pipeline started from Kirkuk, passed through Jordan, and ended at the port of Haifa in Israel for export. This pipeline is no longer in use. After World War II, the Iraq Petroleum Company built another new pipeline from Kirkuk to the port of Baniyas in Syria. This pipeline has a diameter of 76.2 centimeters and a length of 896 kilometers. This pipeline started transporting oil in 1952, with an annual transport capacity of over 14 million tons, which greatly increased Iraq's oil production. In 1953, the production increased by more than two and a half times compared to 1951. The British call this pipeline Iraq's "third river" in addition to the Tigris and Euphrates.

　　The largest pipeline in the Middle East is laid by the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company, an affiliate of Aramco. This pipeline starts from Abqaiq, the oilfield center of Saudi Arabia, passes through Jordan and Syria, and ends not far south of the port of Sidon in Lebanon for export. It is approximately 1,700 kilometers long. The first section of this pipeline, from the starting point to Qaisumah in northeastern Saudi Arabia, is 520 kilometers long and is directly operated by Aramco. The remaining 1,200 kilometers are operated by the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company. This is a huge suction tube. When it started transporting oil in 1950, it transported 300,000 barrels per day, increasing by 10% every summer. The annual transport volume of this pipeline reaches 16 million tons, accounting for about one-third of the total oil plundered by Aramco in Saudi Arabia each year. It is estimated that by 1958, this pipeline will be able to transport 20 million tons of oil annually. If new pumping stations are added and the pipeline setup is improved, the transport volume can reach 25 million tons per year. This pipeline not only replaced the 14,200-kilometer voyage of the past seventy to eighty oil tankers around the Arabian Peninsula to reach the Mediterranean Sea, but also saved the Suez Canal passage fees, reducing Aramco's transportation costs by one-third, thereby greatly reducing costs.

　　British and American monopoly capital frantically seize Middle East oil, obtaining huge astronomical profits, but the sovereign countries where those pipelines are located can only get very little rent and taxes. Before 1950, Iraq could only get 10%-11% of the Iraq Petroleum Company's profits. As for other countries, they got even less. According to the Syrian Ministry of Finance, the Iraq Petroleum Company earns 200 million Syrian pounds annually by passing its oil pipelines through Syrian territory, but only pays Syria 1 million Syrian pounds. And Lebanon gets even less.

　　The people of Arab countries have long been dissatisfied with the status quo of the oil pipelines being occupied by Western colonial countries. They firmly oppose the imperialist policy of plunder. In August of this year, the governments of Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon held a meeting to discuss the issue of revenue from the oil pipelines passing through their countries. Lebanon passed a bill at the end of June to levy taxes on oil companies with oil pipelines passing through its territory, retroactive to January 1, 1952. But so far, the demands of these countries have not been met.

　　Egypt's announcement of the nationalization of the Suez Canal has greatly encouraged the struggle of the people of Arab countries to win national independence and safeguard national sovereignty. At the same time, they have united unprecedentedly to support the just struggle of the Egyptian people. Under the situation that Western countries such as Britain and France are carrying out military buildup in the Mediterranean Sea, attempting to carry out armed intervention in Egypt's sovereignty, the oil pipeline issue has attracted special attention. The Syrian trade union organization has warned the colonialists that once armed intervention against Egypt takes place, Syrian workers will cut off the oil pipelines passing through Syrian territory. The Arab mass organization "Resistance Movement" also warned that if any violent action is taken against Egypt on the canal issue, Western facilities in the Arab world will be destroyed.

### 帝国主义在中东的吸血管

    帝国主义在中东的吸血管
    中东地区，主要在波斯湾沿岸一带，是世界上最大的石油蕴藏区。根据1955年的估计，中东的石油蕴藏量有一百六十六亿三千五百万吨，占世界总蕴藏量的64.6％。
    但是中东的石油并没有成为中东各国人民的财富，二十世纪以来，它成了西方殖民国家掠夺的对象。在最近三十年内，帝国主义从中东夺取的石油从每年五百万吨增加到了每年一亿六千二百万吨。
    为了掠夺石油，帝国主义在中东建立了港口和铺设了输油管，四条巨大的长距离的输油管穿过阿拉伯国家的领土，直通地中海。这些油管像吸血管一样把石油输向西方。
    中东主要的几条油管属于伊拉克石油公司和大阿拉伯油管公司——阿美石油公司的附设机构。
    以英国资本为主的伊拉克石油公司垄断了伊拉克几乎全部的石油。它从伊拉克掠走的石油，1955年达到三千四百万吨。这些石油除了很少一部分原油通过油管输入伊朗去炼制外，其余绝大部分都通过油管输向地中海岸。去年伊拉克石油公司就有三千万吨以上的石油通过油管输送。油管输送为帝国主义提供了更大的利润，每桶（约一百三十五公斤）比海运便宜二角七分美元，这是一种额外利润。因此，光是去年一年，伊拉克石油公司就获得了六千万美元左右的额外利润。
    伊拉克石油公司原先有三条输油管。两条从伊拉克的产油中心基尔库克开始，经过叙利亚到黎巴嫩的的黎波里港出口。这两条平行的输油管分别在1934年与1949年开始输油，全长八五一点二公里，油管的直径一条是三十点四八公分，另一条是四十点六四公分。第三条油管从基尔库克开始，经约旦到以色列的海法港出口，这条油管现在已经不用了。第二次世界大战后，伊拉克石油公司又新建了一条油管，从基尔库克到叙利亚的巴尼亚斯港。这条油管直径七六点二公分，长达八百九十六公里。这条油管在1952年开始输油，每年可输油一千四百万吨以上，使伊拉克石油产量顿时大增，1953年比1951年增产二倍半以上。英国人称这条油管为除底格里斯与幼发拉底河以外伊拉克的“第三条河”。
    中东最大的一条油管，是阿美石油公司的附设机构大阿拉伯油管公司所敷设的。这条油管从沙特阿拉伯的油区中心阿勃凯克开始，经过约旦、叙利亚，在黎巴嫩的西顿港以南不远处出口。全长约一千七百多公里。这条油管的最前一段，从起点到沙特阿拉伯东北部的凯苏玛，长五百二十公里，为阿美石油公司直接经营。其余一千二百多公里由大阿拉伯油管公司负责经营。这是一条巨大的吸血管。1950年开始输油时，每天输油三十万桶，每年夏季增加10％。这条油管每年的输油量达到一千六百万吨，约为阿美石油公司每年在沙特阿拉伯所掠夺的石油总量的三分之一。估计到1958年，这条油管每年将能输油二千万吨，如再添设新的抽唧站，改进油管设置，输油量能达每年二千五百万吨。这条油管不但代替了过去七十到八十艘油船绕经阿拉伯半岛而达地中海的一万四千二百公里的航程，而且还节省了支付苏伊士运河的通行费，使阿美石油公司的运输费用减少了三分之一，从而大大降低了成本。
    英美垄断资本疯狂地劫夺中东石油，获得了巨额的天文数字的利润，但那些油管所在地的主权国家却只能得到很少一些租税。1950年以前，伊拉克只能得到伊拉克石油公司利润的10％—11％。至于其他国家，那就更少得可怜了。据叙利亚财政部估计，伊拉克石油公司将其输油管通过叙利亚领土，每年获利二亿叙镑，但只付给叙利亚一百万叙镑。而黎巴嫩所得更微。
    阿拉伯各国人民早就不满于油管被西方殖民国家霸占的现状。他们坚决反对帝国主义的掠夺政策。今年8月，叙利亚、约旦、黎巴嫩三国政府举行会议讨论了通过他们国家的油管的收益问题。黎巴嫩在6月底通过了一项法案，对有油管通过它领土的石油公司征收税金，从1952年1月1日起追算。但是至今这些国家的要求仍未得到满足。
    埃及宣布苏彝士运河收为国有的行动，大大地鼓舞了阿拉伯各国人民争取民族独立与维护国家主权的斗争情绪。同时，他们已空前地团结起来，支持埃及人民的正义斗争。在英法等西方国家在地中海进行军事集结，企图对埃及主权进行武装干涉的形势下，油管问题便引起了人们的特别的注意。叙利亚工会组织曾警告殖民主义者，一旦发生武装干涉埃及的行动，叙利亚工人就要割断通过叙利亚境内的油管。阿拉伯群众组织“抵抗运动”也警告说，一旦在运河问题上对埃及采取任何暴力行动的话，西方在阿拉伯世界的设施将被破坏。
