    The visiting Prime Minister Suhrawardy of Pakistan held cordial talks with the leaders of our government; as a result of the talks, the prime ministers of China and Pakistan issued a joint statement. In this joint statement, the two prime ministers stated their common views on maintaining peace, easing international tensions, and promoting friendly cooperation between Asian and African countries. The two prime ministers believe that it is necessary to develop commercial, cultural relations and friendly exchanges between the two countries to further strengthen mutual understanding and friendship. Premier Zhou Enlai also accepted Prime Minister Suhrawardy's invitation to visit Pakistan in the near future. The Chinese people warmly support this joint statement and believe that it is a new contribution to the development of friendly relations between China and Pakistan and the promotion of peace in Asia and the world.
    Like many countries in Asia and Africa, China and Pakistan are ancient and young countries. In order to consolidate their independence, promote national construction, and eliminate the scourges left by colonialism, Asian and African countries cherish world peace and friendly cooperation with each other. This common desire led to the historic Bandung Conference resolutions. For more than a year, the influence of the Bandung spirit has been expanding, and peace and friendly cooperation have become a common trend in Asian and African countries. Facts have proved that even if Asian and African countries have different social systems and do not have completely consistent views on certain international issues, peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between them are not only possible, but also very beneficial to everyone. This time, the prime ministers of China and Pakistan reaffirmed their confidence in the Bandung resolutions and expressed their determination to do their utmost to maintain peace, to ease international tensions with all their strength, and to continue to work to promote friendly cooperation between Asian and African countries. These are all in complete conformity with the wishes of the Chinese and Pakistani people. Prime Minister Suhrawardy said in Beijing: "For us, peace is not just a word of hope, but an indispensable need... It is on this basis that we extend the hand of friendship and cooperation to all countries in the world, especially our neighbors!" The Chinese people cherish the Pakistani people's desire for peace and friendship brought by Prime Minister Suhrawardy. In order to build our great motherland, the Chinese government and people have always pursued a policy of peace and friendly cooperation. We sincerely hope that Prime Minister Suhrawardy will convey to the Pakistani people that on the road of peace and friendship, the Chinese people will be the most loyal friends of all those who are willing to advance together on this road.
    China and Pakistan are neighboring countries with a long history of economic and cultural ties. Therefore, the desire in the joint statement of the two prime ministers to develop commercial and cultural relations and friendly exchanges between the two countries has aroused great interest among our people. We believe that the development of these relations will not only help to further strengthen mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the two countries, but also be conducive to the economic and cultural construction efforts that the people of the two countries are working on, and bring direct benefits to the people of the two countries. We believe that the governments and people of the two countries will take concrete measures based on this joint statement, on the basis of the achievements already made in the past few years, to further develop trade and cultural exchange relations between the two countries.
    Our people are concentrating their efforts on peaceful construction and express a warm welcome to distinguished guests who come to visit with peace and goodwill. These expressions of our people are the broad and profound mass base for the peaceful and friendly wishes expressed by our national leaders in their talks with Prime Minister Suhrawardy. Now that Prime Minister Suhrawardy is about to leave our capital and visit many other regions of our country, we sincerely hope that the distinguished guests can learn more about our country's situation and give us valuable opinions, so as to create better conditions for promoting the friendly development between the two countries.

    中巴友谊的新贡献
    正在我国访问的苏拉瓦底总理同我国政府领导人举行了亲切的会谈；作为会谈的结果，中巴两国总理发表了联合声明。在这个联合声明中，两国总理申述了对于维护和平、和缓国际紧张局势和促进亚非各国之间的友好合作的共同意见。两国总理认为有必要发展两国之间的商务的、文化的关系和友好来往，以进一步加强相互了解和友谊。周恩来总理并接受了苏拉瓦底总理的邀请，将在不久的将来访问巴基斯坦。中国人民热诚地拥护这个联合声明，并认为它是发展中巴两国的友好关系、促进亚洲和世界和平的一个新的贡献。
    中巴两国和亚非地区的许多国家一样，都是古老而又年青的国家。亚非国家为了巩固自己的独立、推进国家建设和扫除殖民主义所留下的祸害，都十分珍视世界和平和相互间的友好合作。这种共同的愿望导致了历史性的万隆会议决议。一年多来，万隆精神的影响正日益扩大，和平和友好合作已成为亚非国家的共同的趋势。事实证明，亚非国家之间即使社会制度不同、在某些国际问题上的看法也不完全一致，但是和平相处和相互间的友好合作不但是可能的，而且是对于大家都十分有益的。这次，中巴两国总理重申了他们对于万隆决议的信心，并表示决心尽最大力量来维护和平、以一切力量来和缓国际紧张局势，并且愿为促进亚非各国之间的友好合作而继续努力。这些都是和中巴两国人民的愿望完全相符合的。苏拉瓦底总理在北京说：“对于我们来说，和平不仅仅是一个希望的字眼，而且是一种必不可少的需要，……我们就是在这个基础上向世界上所有的国家，特别是我们的邻国伸出友谊和合作之手！”中国人民十分珍视苏拉瓦底总理所带来的巴基斯坦人民的这种和平和友好的愿望。中国政府和人民为了建设我们伟大的祖国，一贯奉行和平和友好合作的政策，我们热诚地期望苏拉瓦底总理转告巴基斯坦人民：在和平和友好的道路上，中国人民将是一切愿意在这条道路上共同前进的人们的最忠实的朋友。
    中巴两国是具有悠久的经济、文化联系的邻国，因此，两国总理联合声明中关于发展两国之间的商务的、文化的关系和友好往来的愿望，引起了我国人民极大的兴趣。我们认为，这些关系的发展，不但有助于进一步加强两国人民之间的相互了解和友谊，而且还有利于两国人民正在努力进行的经济、文化建设工作，为两国人民带来直接的利益。我们相信，两国政府和人民将根据这个联合声明，在过去几年来已有成就的基础上，采取具体的措施，使得两国之间的贸易往来和文化交流关系进一步发展起来。
    我国人民正在集中力量从事和平建设，对于怀着和平和善意前来访问的贵宾，表示热烈的欢迎。我国人民的这些表现，正是我国国家领导人在同苏拉瓦底总理的会谈中所表达的和平和友好愿望的广泛深厚的群众基础。现在，苏拉瓦底总理即将离开我国首都前往我国其他许多地区进行访问，我们衷心地希望贵宾们能够更多地了解我国的情况和向我们提出宝贵的意见，为促进两国之间友好的发展创造更好的条件。
