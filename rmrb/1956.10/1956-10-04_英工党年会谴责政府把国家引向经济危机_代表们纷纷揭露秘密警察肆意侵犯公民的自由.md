Xinhua News Agency, Blackpool, 3rd - At the British Labour Party Annual Conference on October 1st, a resolution was passed condemning the British government's domestic policy. The draft resolution was proposed by the National Union of Mineworkers, which pointed out that the government's policies were "leading the country to the brink of economic crisis." The resolution also stated that the Labour Party should make great efforts to strive for the formation of a Labour government.

Representatives who spoke during the discussion of this issue pointed out that in recent years, due to the so-called "economic measures" implemented by the government, the living standards of the British working people have declined, even though labor productivity is increasing.

The speech by Cousins, General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, attracted great attention from the representatives. He mentioned that in the past five years, prices in Britain have increased by 25%. He said that trade unions cannot remain indifferent when the government's actions only benefit a small group of people, while harming the vast majority of society. Cousins believes that the only correct path for Britain is industrial nationalization.

The annual conference then discussed the issue of "individual freedom." During the discussion, people exposed the growing threat of the British secret police to citizens' freedoms and the strong discrimination against people who believe in communism. They revealed that British people have lost their right to a livelihood due to secret accusations secretly carried out by the secret police based on secret evidence from secret informers. Anyone, if at any time they have held views that an unknown secret policeman considers communist, or have had relationships or dealings with such people, or have even sympathized with their opinions, cannot feel secure.

Chelsea's Ben Levy proposed a resolution that sounded the alarm about the increasing power of the secret police and the growing trend of allowing security measures to infringe on individual freedoms, and instructed the executive committee to request the government to take measures to safeguard freedom of thought, speech, and assembly. It also demanded that if someone is considered a danger to public safety, they should be notified with a written indictment, and they have the right to appeal and have the right to be defended by a legal or trade union representative in the appeal. Such a person has the right to appeal to three judges of the High Court.

Hornsey's Mostyn supported the motion, saying, "We don't want a bit of McCarthyism in Britain."

Rick's MP, Harold Davies, said: "Civil liberties are in danger. Telephones are being tapped, letters are being opened..."

James Griffiths spoke on behalf of the Executive Committee against the motion. He demanded that the responsibility for security be handed over to the minister, and demanded that the motion be withdrawn.

The original proposer, Levy, opposed the withdrawal to cheers. Under the "block vote" system, which facilitates control by right-wing leaders, the motion was defeated by 3,478,000 votes to 2,625,000 votes.

### 英工党年会谴责政府把国家引向经济危机  代表们纷纷揭露秘密警察肆意侵犯公民的自由

    英工党年会谴责政府把国家引向经济危机
    代表们纷纷揭露秘密警察肆意侵犯公民的自由
    据新华社布莱克浦3日电　在英国工党年会10月1日的会议上通过了一项指责英国政府的对内政策的决议。决议草案是全国矿工联盟提出的，它指出，政府政策“把国家引向了经济危机的边缘”。决议还说，工党应该大加努力，争取成立工党政府。
    在讨论这个问题的时候发言的代表指出，近年来由于政府实行的所谓“经济措施”，英国劳动人民的生活水平下降了，虽然劳动生产率是在提高。
    运输与不熟练工人工会总书记库辛斯的发言引起了代表们很大的注意。他提到，最近五年来英国的物价提高了25％。他说，当政府的行动仅仅对一小批人有利，而对社会上其余大部分人有害的时候，工会不能漠不关心。库辛斯认为，对英国来说，唯一正确的道路就是工业国有化。
    接着年会讨论“个人自由”问题。讨论中，人们揭露了英国秘密警察对公民自由的日益增长的威胁和对信仰共产主义的人们的强烈歧视。他们揭露，由于秘密警察根据秘密的告发者的秘密证据而秘密进行的秘密控告，英国人民已经失去了他们的生活权利。无论是什么人，如果他在任何时候有过被某个不知名的秘密警察认为是共产党的观点，或者是和这样的人有关系，有过来往，或者甚至曾经同情过这样的人的意见，他就得不到安全。
    切尔西的本·利维提议通过一项决议，这项决议对于秘密警察权力的增强和允许以保安手段侵犯个人自由的越来越厉害的倾向发出警号，并且责成执行委员会要求政府采取措施以保障思想、言论和集会的自由。它还要求，如果认为某人对公共安全有危险，就要用书面的起诉书通知他，他有权上诉并且在上诉中有权由法定的或工会的代表替他辩护，这样的人有权向三个高等法院的法官上诉。
    荷恩塞的莫斯廷支持这个动议，他说：“我们不要在英国再有一点一滴的麦卡锡主义。”
    里克的议员哈罗德·戴维斯说：“公民自由正处在危险中。电话遭到偷听，信件被人偷拆……”
    詹姆斯·葛莱菲斯代表执行委员会发言反对这个动议。他要求把保安的责任交给大臣，并且要求撤销这个动议。
    原提案人利维在欢呼声中反对撤销。在便于右翼领袖控制的“集体表决”制下，这个动议以三百四十七万八千票对二百六十二万五千票被否决。
