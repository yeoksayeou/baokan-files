    Striving for the Unity of the International Trade Union Movement
    Zhou Meisheng
    The Eighth Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) General Council, held in Sofia from September 27 to October 3, is a major event in the international trade union movement. This meeting was given great importance by the working classes and trade union organizations of all countries. Trade union representatives from various countries fully discussed the pressing issues currently facing the international trade union movement at the meeting, decided to take effective measures to strive for the unity of the trade union movement, to defend the economic and social welfare of working people, called for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, supported the struggles of colonial and oppressed people, and decided to convene the Fourth World Trade Union Congress. The achievements of the meeting will have a significant impact on promoting the further development of the international trade union movement and promoting the struggles of the working people of all countries for peace, democracy, and their own rights.
    Making every effort to strive for the unity of trade unions of all factions is the most important and urgent task of the current international trade union movement, and it is also the central topic of the WFTU General Council meeting in Sofia. As everyone knows, trade unions are mass organizations of the working class, and the unity of the trade union movement is of great significance to the unity of the working class and all working people. Before the Second World War, the international trade union movement was in a state of division, and the working class did not have a unified, international trade union organization. This situation greatly weakened the fighting strength of the working class and facilitated the heinous activities of the fascists in launching a world war. After the war, at the request of the working classes of various countries, the World Federation of Trade Unions, the largest international trade union organization in the history of the workers' movement, was established in Paris in October 1945. At that time, the WFTU almost included all trade union federations in the world (the American Federation of Labor did not participate), and its establishment greatly changed the face of the international trade union movement. However, instigated by "Cold War" conspirators, some trade union leaders in Western countries withdrew from the WFTU in 1949 and established another organization, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). This plunged the international trade union movement back into division, facilitated the heinous policies of imperialism in expanding armaments and preparing for war and carrying out the Cold War, and caused significant damage to the interests of the working class. From historical experience, the working classes of various countries have increasingly realized that unity is the most powerful weapon of the working class, while division only benefits the enemies of the working people. Therefore, in recent years, the call for restoring and strengthening unity and cooperation between trade unions of various factions has been rising. The speeches of representatives from various countries at the Eighth Session of the WFTU General Council fully reflected this strong desire of the world's working class.
    Under the current international situation, striving for the unity of the international trade union movement is not only very necessary but also entirely possible. The workers of the world are class brothers and sisters. Although they have different ideologies and religious beliefs, their fundamental interests and demands are consistent. They all demand to live in peace, oppose new wars, and oppose the imperialist policies of expanding armaments and preparing for war. In capitalist countries, workers are subjected to the cruel exploitation of capitalists, and they unanimously demand higher wages, shorter working hours, and improved working conditions, and strive for trade union rights and democratic rights. These common interests and demands are the solid foundation for the unity of trade unions of all countries. In fact, in the struggles of workers in capitalist countries to fight for their right to livelihood in recent years, the unity between local trade union organizations of various factions has been increasingly strengthened. With the increasing relaxation of the international situation and the rising tide of peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems, unprecedentedly favorable conditions have emerged for the unity of the international trade union movement. Today, since the leaders of countries with different political and social systems can meet and reach agreements, why can't the various organizations of the working class carry out close cooperation and contact? At present, the only obstacle to the unity of the international trade union movement is that in the trade union leaderships of certain capitalist countries and in the leadership of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions, there still exist forces that oppose the cause of international cooperation. However, as long as the working class is good at utilizing the favorable conditions that have already emerged, these obstacles are not difficult to overcome.
    In the struggle to strive for the unity of the international trade union movement, the WFTU has made tremendous contributions. October 3rd is the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the WFTU. For eleven years, the WFTU has unswervingly implemented the policy of unity and has carried out heroic struggles to defend the economic and social rights of working people, defend world peace, and oppose colonial oppression. Because all of its activities are in line with the vital interests of the working people of all countries, its prestige and role are growing day by day. The existence of this largest international trade union organization, with 88 million members and including trade union organizations from socialist countries and many capitalist countries, and its consistent implementation of the policy of unity, is an important guarantee for striving for the unity of the international trade union movement. With the efforts of the working classes of the world, the unity and cooperation of the international trade union movement will surely be realized.

### 争取国际工会运动的团结

    争取国际工会运动的团结
    周梅生
    从9月27日至10月3日在索非亚举行的世界工会联合会理事会第八次会议是国际工会运动中的一件大事。这次会议受到世界各国工人阶级和工会组织的极大重视。来自世界各国的工会代表们在会议上充分地讨论了目前国际工会运动中的各项迫切问题，决定采取有效措施以争取工会运动的团结，保卫劳动人民的经济和社会福利，呼吁裁减军备和禁止原子武器，支持殖民地和被压迫人民的斗争，并决定召开第四次世界工会代表大会。会议的成就对于促进国际工会运动的进一步发展和推动各国劳动人民争取和平民主和本身权利的斗争，都将产生极大的影响。
    尽一切力量争取各种派别工会的团结，是当前国际工会运动最重要、最迫切的任务，也是世界工联理事会索非亚会议的中心议题。大家知道，工会是工人阶级的群众性组织，工会运动的团结对于工人阶级和全体劳动人民的团结具有重大的意义。在第二次世界大战前，国际工会运动是陷于分裂状态的，工人阶级没有一个统一的、国际性的工会组织。这种情况曾经大大地削弱了工人阶级的战斗力量，便利了法西斯主义者发动世界大战的罪恶活动。战后，在各国工人阶级的要求下，1945年10月在巴黎成立了工人运动史上第一个最大的国际工会组织——世界工会联合会。世界工联当时差不多包括了世界各国一切工会联合会（美国劳联没有参加），它的成立大大地改变了国际工会运动的面貌。但是，在“冷战”阴谋家的策动下，西方国家的一些工会领袖在1949年退出了世界工联，并且成立了另外一个组织——国际自由工会联合会。这就使国际工会运动重新陷入分裂，便利了帝国主义扩军备战和进行冷战的罪恶政策，使工人阶级的利益遭受了重大的损失。各国工人阶级从历史的经验中越来越深刻地认识到：团结是工人阶级最有力的武器，而分裂只是对劳动人民的敌人有利。因此，近年以来，要求恢复和加强各个派别工会之间的团结合作的呼声日益高涨。各国代表在世界工联理事会第八次会议上的发言，充分地反映了世界工人阶级的这种强烈愿望。
    在当前的国际形势下，争取国际工会运动的团结不仅十分必要，而且是完全可能的。全世界的工人是阶级兄弟，尽管思想观念和宗教信仰不同，他们的根本利益和要求是一致的。他们都要求过和平生活，反对新战争，反对帝国主义扩军备战政策。在资本主义国家，工人都受到资本家的残酷剥削，他们一致要求提高工资、缩短工作时间和改善劳动条件，争取工会权利和民主权利。这些共同的利益和要求，就是各国工会团结的坚实基础。事实上，在近年来资本主义国家工人争取生活权利的斗争中，各种派别的地方工会组织之间的团结已经日益加强了。随着国际局势的日趋缓和，不同制度国家和平共处的浪潮日益高涨，国际工会运动的团结已经出现了空前有利的条件。今天既然政治和社会制度不同的国家领袖能够会晤并且达成协议，为什么工人阶级的各个组织之间不能进行亲密的合作和联系呢？目前国际工会运动团结的唯一障碍，就是在某些资本主义国家的工会领导中以及在国际自由工联和基督教工会国际联合会的领导人中，还存在着反对国际合作事业的力量。但是，只要工人阶级善于利用目前已经出现的有利条件，这些障碍是不难克服的。
    在争取国际工会运动团结的斗争中，世界工联作出了巨大的贡献。10月3日是世界工联成立十一周年纪念日。十一年来，世界工联坚持不渝地执行了团结的方针，为保卫劳动人民的经济和社会权利、保卫世界和平、反对殖民压迫而进行了英勇的斗争。由于它的全部活动符合各国劳动人民的切身利益，它的威信和作用正在日益增长。拥有八千八百万会员、包括社会主义国家和许多资本主义国家工会组织在内的这个最大的国际工会组织的存在和它一贯执行的团结政策，是争取国际工会运动团结的重要保证。在全世界工人阶级的努力下，国际工会运动的团结和合作是一定能够实现的。
