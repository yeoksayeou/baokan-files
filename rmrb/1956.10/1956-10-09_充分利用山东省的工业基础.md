Fully Utilize Shandong Province's Industrial Base
　　Zhao Jianmin, Governor of Shandong Province

In recent years, Shandong's industrial production has greatly developed. The output value in 1955 increased by 275.6% compared to 1949. Its proportion in the total industrial and agricultural output value has risen from 20.9% in 1949 to 33.8% in 1955. In addition to supplying the needs of local people's production and life, Shandong's industry also supplied a portion of machinery, equipment, tools, materials, and daily necessities needed by key construction units, and cultivated and transported a large number of cadres and technical personnel. This is the glorious task of coastal industry, and we will continue to work hard to do a better job in the future.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the political report to the "Eighth National Congress" on behalf of the Party Central Committee: "We should make full use of the favorable conditions of the coastal provinces, continue to appropriately develop industry there, to help the development of industry in the interior and accelerate the industrialization of the country." "In the second five-year plan, in addition to making full use of the industrial bases of Northeast China and East China, we must also rationally utilize the roles of Hebei, Shandong, and South China in the development of industry." We believe that this policy is completely correct and gives coastal areas great excitement and encouragement. However, in the past, due to our insufficient understanding of the important role of coastal small and medium-sized enterprises in supporting key construction projects and in the development of the national economy, and our one-sided emphasis on being located on the front line of national defense, coupled with our insufficient leadership in industrial production, the enthusiasm of cadres in Shandong in the industrial field, as well as the full utilization and rational development of Shandong's industrial base, have been affected to a certain extent. This is incompatible with the growing demands of socialist construction and national economic development.

There are many favorable conditions for fully utilizing and rationally developing Shandong's industry.

First, Shandong's industries mostly obtain materials locally and sell them locally. Shandong Province is rich in mineral resources, especially coal and iron. Agricultural cash crops such as cotton (by 1962, the annual cotton production will reach more than 12 million dan, which can supply 3.6 million spindles), flue-cured tobacco, peanuts, wheat, soybeans, fruits, and tussah silk are also produced in large quantities. Marine resources such as fish, salt, and seaweed are also abundant. Therefore, it is suitable to develop mining, metallurgy, machinery, chemical, glass and ceramics, papermaking, textile, and food processing industries. In terms of product sales, Shandong has a large population and constantly improving agricultural production, and most products have close ties with the vast people in the nearby areas, forming a vast sales market for industrial products. This requires Shandong's industry to produce more products in order to exchange them for the agricultural products produced by farmers.

Second, Shandong has many state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private enterprises. The equipment is outdated, the technology is backward, the productivity is not balanced enough, and the equipment utilization rate is low, so the potential is great. If technical transformation, reconstruction, and expansion are carried out in a planned manner, greater economic results can be achieved with less investment. For example, the Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory can recover most of its investment within one year after expansion with an investment of only seven or eight million yuan. The ceramic industry in Zibo City, especially the production of ceramic materials for construction, can not only improve quality but also increase output by more than two times with the addition of a small amount of equipment. The Zibo Glass Factory and the Yantai Clock Factory can earn back two to four times the expansion investment within one year if they can be appropriately reconstructed and expanded.

According to available data, there are conditions for establishing an iron and steel complex in Hanwang, Yishui, Shandong. This iron ore is an Anshan-style sedimentary metamorphic iron ore with reserves of 800 to 1 billion tons. The fuel needed for smelting steel is abundant, close by, and the supply of refractory materials, manganese ore, and fluorite produced in Shandong, as well as transportation conditions, are relatively convenient. The existing railway in Boshan is only 60 kilometers away from the mining area, and the existing railway in Xinwen is only 100 kilometers away from the mining area. Less investment is required when adding new lines in the mining area, and sea transportation can be appropriately used in the future. Shandong can also provide a large reserve of labor. Based on the above situation, we believe that the capital construction project of the Yishui Hanwang Iron and Steel Plant should preferably be included in the second five-year plan.

Finally, in Shandong's industrial production, one of the most pressing problems is the serious shortage of electricity. Some enterprises have already reduced production due to power shortages. In the future, many factories will need to be reconstructed and expanded, and the demand for electricity will inevitably increase. However, it is difficult for local authorities to solve this problem except for relatively small power plants. We suggest that the central government solve this problem in a unified manner as soon as possible in order to further leverage the role of Shandong's industrial base.

    充分利用山东省的工业基础
　　山东省省长　赵健民
    几年来，山东工业生产有很大发展，1955年的产值较1949年增长275.6％，它在工农业总产值中所占的比例已由1949年的20.9％上升到1955年的33.8％。山东工业除供应当地人民生产和生活的需要外，还供应了重点建设单位所需要的一部分机器设备、工具材料和生活用品，并培养输送了大批干部和技术力量。这是近海工业的光荣任务，我们今后还将继续努力，把工作做得更好。
    刘少奇同志代表党中央向“八大”所作的政治报告中指出：“我们应当充分利用沿海各省的有利条件，继续适当地发展那里的工业，以帮助内地工业的发展，加速全国的工业化。”“在第二个五年内，除开充分利用东北和华东的工业基地以外，还必须合理地发挥河北、山东地区和华南地区在发展工业上的作用。”这个方针性的规定，我们认为是完全正确的，给了沿海地区极大的兴奋和鼓舞。但是过去由于我们对沿海中小型企业支援重点建设和在国民经济发展中的重要作用认识不足，片面地强调了地处国防前线，加以我们对工业生产领导不够，使山东地区干部在工业方面的积极性，以及山东工业基础的充分利用和合理发展均受到了一定的影响，这是同社会主义建设、国民经济发展日益增长的要求不相适应的。
    要充分利用和合理发展山东的工业，有许多有利的条件。
    首先，山东工业多是就地取材，就地销售。山东地区矿藏丰富，其中尤以煤铁较多，农业经济作物如棉花（到1962年，棉花年产量将达到一千二百多万担，可供三百六十万纱锭之用）、烤烟、花生、小麦、大豆、水果、柞蚕丝等产量较大。海上资源如渔、盐、海藻等生产亦多，因而，宜于发展采矿、冶金、机械、化工、玻璃陶瓷、造纸、纺织以及食品加工等工业。在产品销售方面由于山东人口众多，农业生产不断提高，且多数产品和附近地区的广大人民有着密切的联系，形成了工业产品的广大销售市场。这就要求山东地区的工业能够生产更多的产品，以便跟农民生产的农产品相交换。
    其次，山东有不少国营、地方国营和公私合营企业，设备陈旧，技术落后，生产力不够均衡，设备利用率较低，潜力是很大的。如能有计划地进行技术改造和改建扩建，就能够以少量投资收到较大的经济效果。例如青岛纺织机械厂，只要投资七、八百万元，扩建后一年内即可收回投资的大部分；淄博市的陶瓷工业，特别是建筑用的陶瓷材料的生产，只要稍增添一部分设备，不仅可以改进质量，还可提高产量两倍以上。淄博玻璃厂和烟台造钟厂，如能适当改建扩建，一年内即可赚回扩建投资的两倍至四倍。
    根据已有资料来看，在山东沂水韩旺建立钢铁联合企业，也是有条件的。这个铁矿系鞍山式沉积变质铁矿，蕴藏量八—十亿吨。冶炼钢铁需用的燃料藏量多，距离近，山东生产的耐火材料、锰矿、莹石等的供应以及交通条件也都比较方便。博山现有铁路，距矿区不过六十公里，新汶现有铁路距矿区不过一百公里，在增修矿区新线时投资较少，将来还可适当利用海运。山东又可提供大量的劳动后备力量。根据上述情况，我们认为，沂水韩旺钢铁厂的基建项目，最好列入第二个五年计划。
    最后，在山东的工业生产中，一个最迫切的问题是电力严重不足，有的企业已因缺电减产，今后很多工厂要进行改建和扩建，电力需要必将增大，但是除比较小的发电厂外，要地方上来解决这个问题，是比较困难的。我们建议中央早日统筹解决，以利于进一步发挥山东工业基础的作用。
