Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 28th: The Naemo-ri Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jaeryong County, Hwanghae Nam-do, North Korea, has achieved a bumper harvest of rice, exceeding this year's production plan by 62%.

The 74.5 jeongbo (one jeongbo is approximately 15 mu) of rice planted by the cooperative this year yielded an average of 6.8 tons of rice per jeongbo, exceeding the state-mandated yield per unit area by 2.55 tons. Among them, 18 jeongbo of rice paddies yielded an average of 8.25 tons of rice per jeongbo, creating excellent results in rice production. This year, the cooperative members can receive an average of 5.1 tons of rice per household, more than double last year's income, and all sixty member households have become surplus grain households.

The bumper rice harvest of the Naemo-ri Agricultural Production Cooperative this year is mainly due to ensuring timely rice transplanting and adopting the method of close planting with small seedlings, while also paying attention to field operations and increasing fertilization. After plowing the land in the autumn last year, the members diverted water to irrigate the land and freeze it, so no weeds were seen in the rice paddies this year.

    朝鲜一个农业社丰收
    家家都成了余粮户
    新华社平壤28日电　朝鲜黄海南道载宁郡那茂里农业生产合作社的水稻丰产，已经超额62％完成今年的生产计划。
    这个社今年所种植的七十四点五町步（一町步约合十五市亩）水稻，平均每町步收获稻子六吨零八百公斤，比国家规定的单位面积产量高出两吨零五百五十公斤；其中有十八町步稻田平均每町步收获稻子八吨零二百五十公斤，创造了水稻丰产的良好成绩。今年全社平均每户可分得稻子五吨零一百公斤，比去年收入增加一倍多，六十户社员家家都成了余粮户。
    那茂里农业生产合作社今年水稻得到丰收，主要是保证及时插秧和采用小株密植方法，同时注重田间作业，并且增加施肥。社员们在去年秋翻地以后，就引水灌地使它冻结，因此今年的稻田看不到杂草。
