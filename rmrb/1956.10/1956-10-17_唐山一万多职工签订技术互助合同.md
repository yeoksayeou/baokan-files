In Tangshan City, a social atmosphere of mutual learning and technical improvement has taken shape among the workers. According to incomplete statistics from the Tangshan, Zhao Gezhuang, and Linxi mines of Kailuan, the Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, Tangshan Steel Plant, Qixin Cement Plant, and other factories, mines, and basic construction sites, as of the end of August, more than 13,600 employees had signed more than 6,680 technical assistance contracts. The number of workers signing technical assistance contracts in various production factories, mines, and basic construction units is increasing, and the scope is also expanding.

Through the signing of technical assistance contracts, the unity between advanced producers and advanced producers, and between advanced producers and ordinary producers has been strengthened, and the technical level of each person has been improved. The average technical level of underground production workers in Kailuan Zhao Gezhuang Mine increased from 5.8 to 5.95, and the average of underground production workers in Linxi Mine also increased from 4.96 to 5.18. Workers in Wu Jingchun's team of the Third Construction Site of Kailuan Civil Engineering Company, through mutual assistance contracts, had thirteen apprentices learn how to do bricklaying, and three workers were promoted one grade. After Wang Changyou and Li Zhi, workers in the repair workshop of Tangshan Machine Factory, signed a mutual assistance contract, they learned the quenching method and the calculation method for making gears, which improved their technical level. In this skills assessment, they were promoted from level four to level five. Yang Shuzhen, a female worker at Huaxin Weaving Factory, often failed to complete her tasks in the past. After signing a mutual assistance contract with advanced producer Yang Xiuying and receiving technical assistance from Yang Xiuying, she not only completed the monthly plan, but also has not produced any defective cloth for one hundred and thirty days.

    唐山一万多职工签订技术互助合同
    本报讯　在唐山市职工群众中间，互相学习技术提高技术的社会风气已经形成。根据开滦的唐山、赵各庄、林西三矿，唐山机车车辆修理工厂、唐山钢厂、启新水泥厂等厂矿和基本建设工地的不完全统计，到8月底，已有一万三千六百多名职工签订了六千六百八十多份技术互助合同。各生产厂矿和基本建设单位职工签订技术互助合同的人数愈来愈多，范围也愈来愈广。
    通过技术互助合同的签订，使先进生产者与先进生产者之间，先进生产者与普通生产者之间加强了团结，提高了每个人的技术水平。开滦赵各庄矿井下生产工人平均技术水平由五点八级提高到五点九五级，林西矿井下生产工人平均也由四点九六级提高到五点一八级。开滦土建公司三工地吴景春小组的工人，通过互助合同，有十三名徒工学会了做瓦工活，有三个工人升了一级。唐山机器厂修理车间工人王长佑和李志订了互助合同以后，学会了淬火法和做齿轮的计算方法，提高了技术水平，这次考工由四级升到五级。华新织布场女工杨淑真过去经常完不成任务，与先进生产者杨秀英订了互助合同，得到杨秀英技术上的帮助后，不仅完成月计划，而且已经一百三十天没有出过次布。
