    Remove Blockade Restrictions and Invigorate Livestock Trading
    Ren Guangjian
    Currently, the rural markets across the country exhibit a phenomenon in the exchange of draught animals that is incompatible with the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, especially inter-regional adjustments, which are far from satisfactory. There is a general existence of excessive, overly strict, and inflexible restrictions on buying and selling. Selling draught animals requires proof, and buying them also requires proof. Many provinces and counties stipulate that buying draught animals across provinces and counties requires letters of introduction from the provincial, county, or township People's Committees, and must be approved and introduced level by level by the producing provinces and counties before they can be purchased on the market; some areas do not welcome agricultural cooperatives from other areas directly purchasing draught animals on the market; and many areas still prohibit traders from transporting draught animals. If these areas' regulations are not followed, sellers are not allowed to complete the transaction, buyers are not allowed to purchase, and those who have already purchased are ordered to sell the draught animals on the spot, and may even be subject to censure or punishment.
      The over-restrictive nature of draught animal trading has affected the circulation of draught animals. The Rongxing Agricultural Cooperative in the Seventh District of Zhaodong County brought twenty horses to the market for sale, but only sold four after three market days. The masses were very dissatisfied and questioned: "In the past, Liaoning and Hebei came here to buy horses, why aren't they coming now?" This abnormal phenomenon inevitably creates unreasonable regional price differences. In horse-producing counties such as Anda and Zhaodong, farmers cannot sell their horses, and prices are falling. Horses that used to be worth 180 yuan each could only be sold for 140 yuan in the third quarter of this year. However, northeastern horses worth around 250 yuan could be sold for 450 yuan if transported to Jinan and other places.
    Why restrict draught animal trading? Some people believe that if sellers are not restricted in draught animal trading, it will lead to a large outflow of draught animals, affecting local agricultural production; if buyers are not restricted, it will also affect the planned adjustment of draught animals; and livestock traders, in order to make profits, will naturally engage in speculation, and failing to ban them will also affect draught animal adjustment and price stability. In short, they worry that allowing free buying and selling and the transport of draught animals will lead to chaos.
    Will not restricting the sale of draught animals really affect local agricultural production? No, it won't. Of course, during the high tide of agricultural cooperativization last year, many agricultural production cooperatives had not had time to arrange for the raising and use of draught animals, etc., so there was an abnormal phenomenon of a large number of draught animals being sold across the country. To this end, the State Council instructed all localities in December last year: farmers should go through certain procedures when selling draught animals to prevent farmers from blindly selling them. This measure was entirely correct at the time. However, the situation is now completely different: agricultural cooperativization has been basically achieved nationwide, and the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives have made arrangements for draught animals to varying degrees, with certain systems for their use, feeding, and remuneration. The livestock to be sold now are mostly surplus after planning according to the needs of agricultural production, or are to be exchanged on the market. Under these circumstances, restricting draught animal trading again will not only be detrimental to the development of agricultural production but will also inevitably lead to a lack of attention to the maintenance of these draught animals.
    Will not restricting buyers really disrupt the planned adjustment of livestock? This will not happen either. The so-called planned adjustment can only be the adjustment of surpluses and deficiencies between major production areas and major sales areas. This kind of plan should exist, and this kind of planned adjustment is also necessary, but it is not the only way. Because the distribution of draught animal producing and selling areas is staggered and the rules of circulation are very complicated. Many areas have both inflows and outflows coexisting in one province and one county. It is impossible to imagine that one plan can perfect such a complex circulation work. Therefore, even if there is no plan in advance,
  trading should be allowed as long as there is actually a need and possibility for circulation between the producing and selling areas.
  The sales area can purchase from the production area market, and the production area can also bring draught animals to the sales area market for direct sale, without
  any approval procedures. Only by combining the planned adjustment of draught animals between major producing and selling areas in large quantities
  with the free buying and selling between scattered producing and selling areas in small quantities can the exchange of livestock be invigorated,
  to meet the needs of production and sales.
    Livestock traders have a negative side in their operations, which is raising prices to sell and lowering prices to buy, and evading taxes. However, there are now very few livestock traders in draught animal markets across the country, and most of them have joined agricultural production or moved into other industries. The volume of transport by existing livestock traders accounts for a very small proportion of the market. The buying and selling of draught animals, in addition to direct buying and selling by agricultural production cooperatives, is mainly controlled by supply and marketing cooperatives for purchase and supply. Livestock traders can no longer control the draught animal market and prices. However, livestock traders still play a certain positive role in invigorating sporadic, short-distance draught animal transactions, because supply and marketing cooperatives, in addition to undertaking long-distance, large-scale inter-regional draught animal adjustments, cannot make short-distance, sporadic draught animal adjustments to meet needs. Under these circumstances, prohibiting livestock traders from transporting draught animals will be detrimental to invigorating the draught animal market. Of course, allowing livestock traders to do whatever they want is also wrong.
    Now is the peak season for draught animals to be on the market, and the volume of draught animals on the market in various places has increased significantly. The current task is to do a good job in adjustment and manage the market to facilitate the circulation of draught animals and support agricultural and animal husbandry production. Those practices that implement blockades and overly strict restrictions on draught animal transactions should be changed immediately. First, relevant departments in various localities should quickly abolish the procedures for level-by-level approval and introduction in the buying and selling of draught animals and allow buyers and sellers to trade freely according to their needs; regardless of whether it is across provinces or counties, whether there is proof of purchase or sale, as long as it does not disrupt prices or evade national taxes, it should not be restricted.
    Second, supply and marketing cooperatives should strengthen the management of the draught animal market and the organization of transactions. The market draught animal exchange service department should do its best to provide services such as agency buying, agency selling, agency raising, and agency transportation to facilitate buying and selling and promote exchange. In addition, organizing and mobilizing agricultural production cooperatives to purchase from the production area market on their own is also worth promoting, as this can reduce intermediate links and ensure proper buying and use.
    Third, livestock traders who have already changed careers will not be reinstated. Existing livestock traders should be allowed to play their active role. To facilitate management and transformation, they should be registered and issued commercial licenses, allowing them to transport goods under the leadership and management of the supply and marketing cooperatives. This is very beneficial to invigorating draught animal trading and meeting the needs of agricultural production cooperatives. The draught animal market exchange service department can also organize traders to buy or sell as needed, driving market transactions and circulation. This not only meets the needs of buyers and sellers but also helps to understand the market situation around and manage livestock traders.

    取消封锁限制，活跃耕畜交易
    任广建
    当前全国各地的农村市场，在耕畜交流方面存在着与农牧业生产发展不相适应的现象，特别是地区间的调剂，更不能令人满意。普遍的存在着买卖限制过多、过严、过死，出卖耕畜要证明，买耕畜也要证明。不少省县规定了跨省跨县买耕畜要省、县或乡人民委员会介绍信，还要经过产地省、县逐级批准、介绍，才能到市场购买；有的地区还不欢迎外地区农业社直接到市场购买耕畜；不少地区仍禁绝商贩贩运耕畜。如不遵照这些地区的规定，要卖的不予成交，要买的不准购买，已买到的也要勒令就地把耕畜出售，甚至还要受到谴责或处罚。
      由于对耕畜交易限制过死，已影响耕畜流转。肇东县七区荣兴农业社牵二十匹马到市场出售，卖了三集才销出四匹，群众很不满意地质问：“过去辽宁、河北到这里买马，现在为什么不来了呢？”这种不正常的现象，必然造成不合理的地区差价。如安达、肇东等产马县，农民有马销不出，价格下跌，过去值一百八十元一匹的马，今年第三季度只能卖一百四十元。而价值二百五十元左右的东北马，如果能运到济南等地就可以卖四百五十元。
    为什么要限制耕畜交易呢？有些人认为，在耕畜交易上如对卖主不加限制将会使耕畜大量外流，影响本地农业生产；如对买主不加限制，也会影响耕畜的计划调剂；而畜贩贩运为了取利，当然要进行投机，不加取缔也会影响耕畜调剂和价格稳定。总之，他们担心允许自由买卖和贩运耕畜就会事情大乱。
    对出卖耕畜不加限制真的会影响本地农业生产吗？不会的。当然，在去年农业合作化高潮的时候，许多农业生产合作社还没有来得及安排耕畜的养用等原因，全国各地曾经发生大量出卖耕畜的反常现象。为此，国务院在去年12月间曾指示各地：农民出卖耕畜要经过一定的手续，以防止农民盲目出卖耕畜。这一措施在当时是完全正确的。但是现在情况已经完全不同了：全国已经基本上实现了农业合作化，绝大部分农业社都先后对耕畜进行了不同程度的安排，使役、饲养、报酬等都有了一定的制度。现在要出卖的牲畜绝大多数是按照农业生产需要规划后多余的，或者要在市场进行调换的。在这种情况下如再对耕畜交易加以限制，不但对发展农业生产不利，而且势必造成对这部分耕畜的保养不重视。
    对买主不加限制真的会打乱牲畜有计划的调剂吗？这也不会的。所谓有计划的调剂，只能是在主要产区和主要销区间进行余缺调剂，这种计划是应该有的，而且这种有计划的调剂也是必要的，但却不是唯一的调剂门径。因为耕畜产销地
  区的分布是犬牙交错，流转规律十分繁杂，不少地区在一省一县都有流进和流出并存的情况，不可能想像用一条计划把这种流转复杂的工作做到完善。因此，事先虽无计划，
  只要产销两地实际上存在着流转的
  需要与可能时，也应该允许交易。销地可到产地市场采购，产区也可以带耕畜到销地市场直接出售，而不
  应有任何批准手续。只有把主要的大批的产销地区间耕畜的有计划调
  剂和分散的小量的产销地区间自由买卖相结合，才能活跃牲畜交流，
  适应产销的需要。
    牲畜贩在经营上有其消极的一面，就是抬价卖，压价买，偷漏税。但是目前各地耕畜市场上畜贩已很少了，他们当中大多数人已经参加农业生产或转入其他行业。现有畜贩的贩运量在市场所占比重很小。耕畜的买卖，除农业生产社直接买卖外，主要已由供销社掌握收购和供应，畜贩已不能左右耕畜市场和价格。但是，牲畜商贩在活跃零星的、短途的耕畜交易上还是有一定的积极作用的，因为供销合作社在担负了长途的大批的地区间的耕畜调剂外，不可能把短途的零星的耕畜调剂工作也做得适合需要。在这样情况下，如果禁止耕畜商贩贩运，就会对活跃耕畜市场不利。当然，对畜贩放任不管也是错误的。
    现在正是耕畜上市的旺季，各地耕畜市场上市量都有显著增加。当前的工作是要做好调剂，管好市场，以便利耕畜的流转，支持农牧业生产。对那些对耕畜交易实行封锁和限制过死的作法应立即改变。首先，各地有关部门应该迅速废除在买卖耕畜中逐级批准和介绍的手续，允许买卖双方按照需要自由交易；不论跨省跨县，有无买卖证明，只要不扰乱价格，不偷漏国税，就不应加以限制。
    其次，供销合作社应加强对耕畜市场的管理和组织成交工作。市场耕畜交流服务部，尽可能作好代买、代卖、代养、代运等工作，以便利买卖，促进交流。此外，组织和发动农业生产社自行到产地市场购买，也是值得提倡的，这样既可减少中间环节，又能买、用得当。
    第三，对已转业的畜贩不再恢复，对现有畜贩，要发挥其积极作用。为便于管理改造，应进行登记，发给商业证，让他们在供销合作社的领导管理下贩运。这对活跃耕畜交易和满足农业生产社需要很有好处。耕畜市场交流服务部，也可视需要组织交易员进行贩买或贩卖，带动市场交易和流转。这样不仅满足了买卖主需要，也有助于对周围市场情况的了解和对畜贩的管理工作。
