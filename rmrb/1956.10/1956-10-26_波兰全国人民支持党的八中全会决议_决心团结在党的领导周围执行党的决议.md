Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 25th: In the days following the conclusion of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party on October 21st, mass rallies have been held across Poland, enthusiastically supporting the decisions of the plenary session. Resolutions and letters expressing support and confidence in the Eighth Central Plenary Session of the United Workers' Party are flooding in. Warsaw newspapers, in reporting on this enthusiastic situation throughout Poland, wrote in headlines: "The people of the whole country are united around the Party's leadership to fight for reforming political and social life"; "The whole country approves and supports the newly elected Party leadership."

Party organizations at the provincial and municipal levels of the Polish United Workers' Party are universally discussing the circumstances and resolutions of the Central Plenary Session. A resolution passed at a meeting of the Provincial Committee of the Lodz Province on October 23rd stated, "The Provincial Committee plenary session welcomes Comrade Gomulka's return to work in the Party's leadership as the First Secretary of the Central Committee. We express that, in the struggle to implement the policies formulated by the Party, we trust and fully support the Party's new leadership." The Executive Committee of the Poznan City Committee also passed a resolution at a meeting on the 22nd, expressing complete trust in and implementation of the Party's resolutions.

Polish workers have expressed firm confidence in the resolutions of the plenary session and are supporting the Party's resolutions with practical actions of selfless labor. In a letter to the Central Committee of the United Workers' Party, all employees of the "Pafawag" vehicle factory in Wrocław said, "We guarantee to consistently and persistently implement the resolutions of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, which, without a doubt, will accelerate the process of democratization of our lives, promote the improvement of the living standards of our working masses, and also promote the consolidation of our independence and Poland's socialist construction." Workers at the Zgoda technical equipment factory in Katowice Province stated clearly in a resolution submitted to the Central Committee of the United Workers' Party, "The fact that the Leninist principles of democracy, the rule of law, and the role of the people have triumphed within the Party has greatly encouraged us." Warsaw handicraftsmen expressed that they must strive to improve and expand services and production to meet the needs of the people.

In addition, workers in many places such as Krakow, Nowa Huta, and Gdansk have also held rallies.

In the Polish Army, Navy, Air Force, and security forces, as well as various military schools and military leadership organs, rallies were held in support of the Party's Eighth Plenary Session. In the speeches and resolutions at these rallies, it was stated that the Polish army is completely united with the working class and all working people. At a rally of naval officers and soldiers, sailors emphasized in their speeches that the Navy believes the new program of the United Workers' Party expresses deep concern for Poland's future and guarantees the unwavering restoration of Leninist principles in the Party, state, and economic life. The Polish security forces said in a resolution at one of their rallies, "We assure the Central Committee and the newly elected Politburo that we will do our utmost to support them in their struggle to realize a program that is in line with the vital interests of the working class and the people of the whole country."

At many rallies throughout the country and in letters submitted to the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Polish working farmers, intellectuals, young students, women, and social figures also expressed their welcome and confidence in the Eighth Plenary Session.

Polish democratic parties have also given complete trust and support to the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the United Workers' Party. The Polish United Peasant Party passed a special resolution for this purpose; the Polish Democratic Party had sent a delegation to the Eighth Plenary Session to meet with the representatives Gomulka and Ochab, among others.

The resolution on strengthening friendship with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries passed at the Eighth Plenary Session of the United Workers' Party has received the heartfelt support of the Polish people. At various rallies in the days following the meeting, and in the resolutions and letters sent to the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party from all over the country, such a conviction was expressed: to consolidate and develop the strong friendship between Poland and the Soviet Union is in line with the fundamental interests of the Polish people and the interests of socialism, and the Polish-Soviet alliance must continue to be the cornerstone of Polish policy.

During this period, only in the three cities of Wrocław, Szczecin, and Krakow did reactionary elements attempt to incite some of the masses to stage demonstrations against the Soviet Union, but they were immediately rebuked by the Polish people and public opinion. Warsaw Radio broadcast that such inflammatory actions were detrimental to the interests of the working class; a commentary in Poland's "People's Tribune" pointed out that in these transformative days, the Party should raise the high vigilance of the workers and the people of the whole country, and not relax for a minute its vigilance against those irresponsible and harmful nationalist inflammatory remarks that damage Polish-Soviet relations and Polish-Soviet solidarity.

    波兰全国人民支持党的八中全会决议
    决心团结在党的领导周围执行党的决议
    新华社华沙25日电　在10月21日波兰统一工人党中央委员会第八次全体会议结束以后的这几天里，波兰各地纷纷举行群众集会，热烈支持全体会议的决定。在这些会议上通过的对统一工人党第八次中央全会表示支持和信任的决议和信件，有如雪片飞来。华沙报纸在报道波兰各地这种热烈情况的时候在标题中写道：“全国人民团结在党的领导周围，进行改革政治生活和社会生活的斗争”；“全国都赞成和支持新选出的党的领导机构”。
    波兰统一工人党各省、市组织正在普遍讨论中央全会讨论的情况和决议。罗兹省省委会在10月23日举行的会议上通过的一项决议中说，“省委会全体会议欢迎哥穆尔卡同志以中央委员会第一书记的身份回到党的领导机构来工作。我们表示：在为执行党所拟订的方针而斗争的过程中，我们信任并且充分支持党的新领导机关。”波兹南市委会执行委员会在22日举行的一次会议上，也通过了一项决议，表示完全信任和执行党的决议。
    波兰工人对全会的决议表示了坚定的信心，并且以忘我劳动的实际行动来支持党的决议。弗罗茨瓦夫
  “帕法瓦格”车辆制造厂的全体职工给统一工人党中央的一封信中说，我们保证一贯地和顽强地执行波兰统一工人党中央委员会全体会议的决议，毫无疑问，它将要加速我们生活的民主化的进程，促进我国劳动群众的生活水平的提高，同时也促使我们的独立和波兰的社会主义建设的巩固。卡托维兹省兹戈达技术装制工厂的职工在一项送交统一工人党中央的决议中明白地说，“民主、法治和人民的作用等方面的列宁主义原则在党内取得胜利这个事实，使我们大大地鼓舞起来。”华沙手工工人表示，一定要努力改善并且扩大服务和生产，以满足人民的需要。
    此外，在克拉科夫、诺瓦胡塔和革但斯克等许多地方，工人们也都纷纷举行集会。
    在波兰陆军、海军、空军和治安部队，以及各军事学校和军事领导机关中，都举行了拥护党八中全会的集会，在这些集会上的发言和决议中，都表示波兰军队是同工人阶级和全体劳动人民完全团结一致的。在一次海军官兵的集会上，水兵们在发言中强调指出：海军认为统一工人党的新的纲领表现了对波兰未来的深切关怀和保证坚定不移地恢复党、国家和经济生活中的列宁主义准则。波兰治安部队在他们的一次集会的决议中说，“我们向中央委员会和新当选的政治局保证，在它们实现符合工人阶级和全国人民的切身利益的纲领而进行的斗争中，我们将竭尽全力支持它们”。
    在各地的许多集会上和递交到波兰统一工人党中央的信件中，波兰劳动农民、知识分子、青年学生、妇女和社会人士也都表示了他们对八中全会的欢迎和信心。
    波兰各民主党派对统一工人党八中全会的决议也给以完全的信任和支持。波兰统一农民党为此通过了一项专门的决议；波兰民主党曾经在八中全会派了一个代表会见了全体会议的代表哥穆尔卡和奥哈布等人。
    统一工人党八中全会上关于加强同苏联和各人民民主国家的友谊的决议得到波兰人民衷心的支持。在会议结束后这几天的各种集会上，在各地送到波兰统一工人党中央的决议和信件中，都表示了这样的信念：巩固和发展波苏之间的牢固的友谊，是符合波兰人民的根本利益和社会主义的利益的，波苏同盟必须继续是波兰政策的基石。
    在这期间，只有在弗罗茨瓦夫、什切青和克拉科夫三个城市中，曾经一度有反动分子企图煽动部分群众进行反对苏联的示威，但是，它们立即受到波兰人民和舆论的斥责。华沙电台广播说，这种煽动性的行动是损害工人阶级利益的；波兰“人民论坛报”的评论指出，在目前这种转变性的日子里，党应当提高工人和全国人民的高度警惕，一分钟也不要放松对那些不负责任的有害波苏关系和波苏团结的民族主义煽动性的言论的警惕。
