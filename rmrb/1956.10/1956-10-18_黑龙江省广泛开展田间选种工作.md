Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 15th October: Under the specific guidance of 65 seed stations and more than 720 agricultural technology extension stations throughout the province, agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Heilongjiang Province are widely carrying out field seed selection work.

    In the Suihua Special District, more than 100 agricultural cooperatives have already single-cut and single-threshed the crops in their seed retention fields. Nehe, Hailun, Suiling and other counties have also established seed evaluation committees at the township level. At the evaluation meetings in Nehe County's townships, each agricultural cooperative presented its best improved varieties. Through the evaluation meetings, the county has signed contracts to exchange 820 tons of high-quality varieties and 200,000 jin of high-quality varieties from farmers. Many new high-quality varieties were also discovered at the high-quality seed evaluation meetings of 400 agricultural cooperatives in Qing’an, Tonghe and other counties in the Suihua Special District.

    The improved varieties promoted in Heilongjiang Province this year have all achieved great results. For example, the improved wheat varieties planted on 600,000 hectares of land achieved an average yield of 2,000 jin per hectare. Suihua, Nenjiang and other regions have even reached 3,000 jin.

    Next year, the planting area of improved varieties in Heilongjiang Province will increase from more than 2.2 million hectares this year to more than 3 million hectares.

    黑龙江省广泛开展田间选种工作
    新华社哈尔滨15日电　黑龙江省各地农业生产合作社在全省六十五个种子站和七百二十多个农业技术推广站的具体指导下，广泛地开展田间选种工作。
    绥化专区已有一百多个农业社对留种田的庄稼做了单割单打。讷河、海伦、绥棱等县还以乡为单位成立了种子评选委员会。讷河县各乡在评选会议上，各农业社都拿出了本社最好的良种。通过评选会议全县已订合同串换优良品种八百二十吨，农家优良品种二十万斤。在绥化专区的庆安、通河等县四百个农业社的良种评选会议上还发现了不少新的优良品种。
    黑龙江省今年推广的优良品种都收到了很大效果。如在六十万公顷土地上种植的优良麦种，平均每公顷的产量达到了二千斤。绥化、嫩江等地区还达到了三千斤。
    明年，黑龙江省优良品种的播种面积，将由今年的二百二十多万公顷发展到三百多万公顷。
