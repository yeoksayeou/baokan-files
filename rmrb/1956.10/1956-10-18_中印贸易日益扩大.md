Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 16th: Since India and China signed a trade agreement two years ago, the upward trend in trade between the two countries has been very significant.

According to figures obtained in New Delhi, the value of goods imported by China from India from 1955 to 1956 has exceeded 65 million rupees. In addition to traditional commodity trade items, both sides have now increased many new commodity trade items. The largest items in China's imports from India are raw cotton, tobacco, and jute. Currently, China's imports of tobacco from India are equal to those of Britain, India's largest tobacco customer.

India, which is currently engaged in construction, is now in need of various industrial raw materials. Therefore, in addition to importing silk, newsprint, caustic soda, anhydrous sodium carbonate, and other chemicals from China, it is also importing more and more industrial products from China. According to the terms of the recently signed new contract, India will also import 60,000 tons of rice from China.

According to materials from the Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry, India's imports from the Tibet region of China increased by 25% last year, while its exports to Tibet increased by 35% during the same period.

Currently, many Indian merchants are preparing with great interest to participate in the Chinese Export Commodities Fair to be held in Guangzhou next month.

    中印贸易日益扩大
    据新华社新德里16日电　自从两年前印度和中国签订贸易协定以来，印中两国贸易上升的趋势非常显著。
    根据在新德里得到的数字，从1955年到1956年，中国从印度进口的货物价值已经超过了六千五百万卢比。除了传统的商品贸易项目以外，现在双方都增加了许多新的商品贸易项目。中国从印度进口的货物中的最大项目是原棉、烟草和黄麻。目前中国从印度进口的烟草同印度烟草的最大主顾英国从印度所进口的相等。
    正在从事建设的印度现在正需要各种工业原料。因此，它除从中国进口丝、新闻纸、苛性钠、无水碳酸钠和其他化学品以外，还从中国进口愈来愈多的工业品。根据最近签订的新合同的条款，印度还将从中国进口六万吨大米。
    根据印度工商部的材料说明，印度从中国西藏地方的进口货在去年已经增加了25％，而它向西藏的输出在同一期间增加了35％。
    目前许多印度商人正怀着浓厚的兴趣准备参加下月在广州举行的中国出口商品展览会。
