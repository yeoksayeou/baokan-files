	New Homes on the South Bank of Nanhewan
	(Our report) The area west of the Meiyukou Bridge in the Datong Coal Mine, at the foot of Mount Tai on the south bank of Nanhewan, has an elegant environment and fresh air. It is north of Nanhewan, and the riverbank is lined with dense willows; to the west is Mount Tai, covered with lush grass. Many workers are envious of this place. This summer, the leaders of the Meiyukou Mine decided to build 200 self-built, publicly assisted houses for workers in this area. So far, more than 100 houses have been occupied by new owners. Zhao Yi, a demobilized soldier who has worked in the mine for more than a year, could not get married due to lack of housing. Now he has married and moved into a new home with his wife, starting a small family. He happily said: Living in such an environment, my body will definitely be strong, and I guarantee there will be no problem with full attendance in the future.
