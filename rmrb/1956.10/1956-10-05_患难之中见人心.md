A Friend in Need is a Friend Indeed
Nancun

The Hebei Daily published the following news item on August 27th:

During this year's rainy season, the villages of Wang Tongyue and Ge Tongyue near Wu Gong Township in Raoyang County, Hebei Province, suffered severe flooding. The floodwaters, reaching above knee-level, surrounded the villages and did not recede. The biggest difficulty faced by the agricultural cooperatives in each village was feeding their livestock. So, they all sent their animals to the agricultural cooperative led by Geng Changsuo in Wu Gong Township. The person who sent the livestock from Ge Tongyue Agricultural Cooperative only brought a note that read: "Changsuo, our cooperative is entrusting you with the temporary care of twelve head of livestock. I think you will definitely help us."

The Wu Gong Township agricultural cooperative also suffered severe flooding, and the floodwaters surrounding the village had only just receded, but they warmly received the sixty-five head of livestock from these four villages. The livestock being fostered were not accustomed to the new environment and did not like to eat grass, so the feeders of the Wu Gong Township cooperative added extra feed for them. The feeders said, "These livestock are 'guests.' We can't let them lose weight, or we would be letting down our brother cooperatives!" The feeders who came with the livestock brought nothing with them, so the Wu Gong Township cooperative specially cleared out the transportation team's courtyard to accommodate them, and sent them rice, white flour, and firewood. The feeder from Wang Tongyue Agricultural Cooperative said with emotion, "The cadres and members of this cooperative treat us a hundred times better!"

Here, we see a brand new relationship between people after agricultural cooperativization. People often say, "The new society is a warm home everywhere," and this is an example. Regarding the difficulties of a neighboring cooperative as one's own, even helping the neighboring cooperative like brothers when one is also in difficulty. This noble socialist spirit should be greatly promoted. If all agricultural cooperatives not only cared about their own interests, but also cared about the interests of neighboring cooperatives, sharing weal and woe, and helping each other in times of trouble, then we would have the strength to overcome all disasters and difficulties and move forward more smoothly on the road to socialism.

Unfortunately, not all agricultural cooperatives are able to treat neighboring cooperatives with a fraternal attitude like the Wu Gong Township agricultural cooperative. Some individual cooperatives even do the opposite, sacrificing the interests of neighboring cooperatives for their own benefit. On August 20th, the Liaoning Daily revealed the following fact:

This spring, the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Heiyu Pao Township, Andong County, Liaoning Province, built a large dam to block water. In order to protect the land of their own cooperative, they built the flood spillway on the land of the neighboring Changfeng Cooperative in Taiping Township. After the dam was built, they recklessly blocked a large amount of water to irrigate their land. Because the amount of water blocked was too large, and there was a lot of rain this year, the spillway could not discharge the large amount of floodwater. The Qianjin Cooperative, fearing that the flood would inundate their own land, claimed that "the flood had destroyed the dam," and secretly opened a gap in the dam, releasing the water into the neighboring cooperatives downstream, flooding a large amount of farmland in seven cooperatives in five townships. According to statistics from just five cooperatives in three townships, more than 3,700 mu of land were flooded.

In contrast, the latter situation cannot but make people feel indignant. Especially when the downstream cooperatives raised objections to the Qianjin Cooperative, demanding compensation for their losses, its leaders still said "justifiably" that their blocking a large amount of water was for "increasing production by a thousand catties and taking the socialist road." The members of the affected cooperative had to question them: "You are taking the socialist road to increase production, but don't other cooperatives need to increase production and take the socialist road? Even if you have entered socialism by doing this, when you stand on the socialist building and look at us, seeing that we have reduced production and the lives of our members have declined because you have entered socialism, do you not feel ashamed?" This questioning is very reasonable. If the Qianjin Cooperative saw how the Wu Gong Township agricultural cooperative treated its friendly neighbors, it should feel even more ashamed. How far can one go on the road to socialism while carrying the ideological baggage of harming others for one's own benefit?

It is said that the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative is a key cooperative in Andong County, with a long history and a large scale. Their construction of this dam was encouraged by the higher authorities, and many county and district cadres were present when they blocked a large amount of water to irrigate their fields. Some people suggested that blocking too much water was dangerous; most of the county and district cadres present refuted this view, believing that the more water blocked, the better, otherwise the plan to increase production by a thousand catties could not be completed. It turned out that the county and district cadres only thought about the key cooperative's increase of a thousand catties, forgetting about the disaster and production reduction of the general cooperatives. It is no wonder that the Qianjin Cooperative boldly dug the dike and released the water, disregarding the interests of brother cooperatives.

    患难之中见人心
    南村
    河北日报8月27日发表了这样一则新闻：
    河北省临近饶阳县五公乡的王同岳、葛同岳等四个村庄，今年雨季受了严重水灾。过膝深的洪水围村不退。各村农业社最感困难的是牲畜无法饲养，便不约而同的把牲口送到五公乡耿长锁领导的农业社去。葛同岳农业社送牲口的人只带去一个字条，上面写着：“长锁，我社十二头牲口委你暂养，我想你一定会帮助。”
    五公乡农业社也遭受了严重水灾，围村的洪水刚退走，但是他们热情地接待了这四个村庄的六十五头牲口。寄养的牲口对新环境不习惯，不爱吃草，五公乡社的饲养员就给它们另加些料。饲养员说：“这些牲口是‘客人’，我们不能让它们掉膘，掉了膘对不起兄弟社啊！”随牲口来的饲养员，什么东西也没带来，五公乡社特别腾出运输队的大院安置他们，给他们送来大米、白面和柴禾。王同岳农业社的饲养员感动地说：“这个社的社干部、社员对俺们一百个好呀！”
    在这里，我们看到了农业合作化以后人与人之间一种崭新的关系。人们常说，“新社会到处是温暖的家”，这就是一个例子。把邻社的困难当做自己的困难，即使自己在困难当中也给邻社兄弟般的帮助。这种高尚的社会主义精神应当大大加以发扬。如果所有的农业社都不只是关心本社的利益，同时也关心邻社的利益，大家休戚相关，患难相扶，那我们就有力量克服一切灾害和困难，更顺利地在社会主义的道路上前进。
    可惜，并不是所有的农业社都能够像五公乡农业社那样，以兄弟的态度对待邻社。有个别社甚至与此相反，为了自己的利益，不惜损害邻社的利益。在8月20日的辽宁日报上，揭发了这么一桩事实：
    辽宁省安东县黑鱼泡乡前进农业社，今年春天修了一条堵水大坝。为了保护本社的土地，把溢洪道口修在近邻太平乡长丰社的地里。大坝修成，又不顾一切地大量堵水灌地。因为堵水量过大，今年的雨水又多，溢洪道排不出大量洪水，前进社怕洪水淹了自己的地，便扬言“洪水冲毁坝堤”，私下在堵水坝上打开缺口，把水放入下游邻社，淹没了五个乡七个社的大量耕地。仅据三个乡五个社的统计，淹没的土地就有三千七百多亩。
    对照起来看，对于后一种情况，不能不使人感到愤慨。尤其是当下游各社向前进社提出意见，要求赔偿损失的时候，它的领导人还“理直气壮”地说他们大量堵水是为了“千斤增产，走社会主义”。受害的合作社的社员不得不质问他们：“你们为了增产走社会主义，难道别的社就不需要增产走社会主义了吗？就算你们这样做走进了社会主义，当你们站在社会主义大楼上望着我们，看到我们因为你们走进社会主义而减产，社员生活下降，你们不觉得惭愧吗？”这种质问是很合理的。如果前进社看到五公乡农业社是怎样对待友邻的，更应该觉得惭愧。背着损人利己的思想包袱走社会主义的路，能够走得多远呢？
    据说，前进农业社是中共安东县的重点社，历史长，规模大。他们修建这条大坝，是得到上级的鼓励的，他们大量堵水灌田的时候，不少县区干部都在场。有人提出堵水量过大有危险；在场的多数县区干部却反驳了这种意见，认为堵水越多越好，不然，完不成千斤增产计划。原来县区干部都只想到重点社的千斤增产，忘记了一般社的受灾减产。这也难怪前进社放心大胆地掘堤放水，不顾兄弟社的利益了。
