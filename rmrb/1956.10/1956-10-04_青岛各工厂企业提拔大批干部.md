Qingdao (By our reporter) Qingdao's state-owned and locally-managed factories and enterprises, implementing the policy of boldly and correctly promoting cadres, promoted a total of 2,440 cadres of various types and levels from January to August, of which 1,431 were promoted to leading core positions such as engineers, workshop directors, and section chiefs.

During this round of cadre promotion, factories paid special attention to the expertise of intellectuals. According to statistics from 25 state-owned factories alone, a total of 332 intellectual cadres were promoted in eight months, of which 150 were promoted to engineers.

Factories also paid attention to promoting cadres from among the broad masses of workers. Many outstanding workers with considerable technical or professional skills and close ties with the masses have been successively promoted to leading core positions. Worker Niu Zhucai of the joint state-private bicycle factory was originally an experienced technical worker. When the factory implemented joint state-private ownership, he actively assisted the Party in many tasks. After the joint venture, he also made some contributions to improving machinery and equipment and improving product quality. Therefore, in March of this year, he was promoted to deputy director of the seventh workshop.

The leadership of some units also paid attention to promoting capitalists with certain working abilities. Jiang Yangyong, the former deputy manager of the privately-owned Shengtai Dyeing Factory, was relatively familiar with supply and sales business. After joining the Qingdao Municipal Dyeing and Weaving Industry Bureau as a clerk in January 1955, his work performance was also active and responsible. He was recently promoted to deputy chief of the Supply and Sales Section of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Bureau.

Through this bold and large-scale promotion of cadres, the leadership strength has been greatly strengthened.

    青岛各工厂企业提拔大批干部
    本报讯　青岛市国营和地方经营的工厂企业，贯彻大胆正确提拔干部的方针，一至八月份共提拔各类各级干部二千四百四十名，其中提拔为工程师、车间主任、科长等以上领导骨干的有一千四百三十一名。
    各厂在这次提拔干部中，特别注意到知识分子的特长，仅据国营二十五个厂的统计，八个月来共提拔了知识分子干部三百三十二名，其中提拔为工程师的有一百五十名。
    各厂也注意了从广大工人中提拔干部，不少具有相当技术或业务水平，并与群众有着密切联系的优秀工人，陆续被提拔为领导骨干。公私合营自行车厂工人牛助栽，原是老技术工人，在这个厂实行公私合营时，他积极协助党作了许多工作，合营后又在改进机器设备、提高产品质量等方面，做出了一些贡献，因此他在今年三月份被提拔为第七车间副主任。
    有些单位的领导方面，还注意提拔具有一定工作能力的资本家。原私营盛泰染厂副经理姜扬永，对供销业务比较熟悉，从1955年1月到青岛市染织工业局任科员后，工作也表现积极负责，最近被提升为染织工业局供销科副科长。
    经过这次大胆和大量地提拔干部，大大加强了领导力量。
