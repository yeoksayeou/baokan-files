Changes in a "Lane Factory"
Xu Xing

	Stepping through the factory gate, I clearly saw the characters "Public-Private Joint Shanghai Xin Cheng Electrical Appliance Factory" on the short wall, and I still wondered if I had come to the wrong place. Could these few small and dilapidated houses in front of me be the factory that has manufactured more than forty kinds of precision instruments in the past two years, and is also the only factory in China that manufactures thermal measurement and control instruments? It was with such surprise that I began my visit.

	Su Jiaji, who is responsible for supply and sales, led me on a tour. He said to me: "Don't look down on our factory, which only covers seven mu and is dilapidated! Our products are now supplying more than one hundred key construction factories and mines across the country; in the fractionation towers of the Yumen Oil Mine; on the No. 7 blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel; in the boiler room of the First Automobile Factory... our instruments are installed everywhere. The First Automobile Factory even sent us a silk banner! Our products have also been exhibited in Leipzig, the Soviet Union, and India, and are also export goods!"

	Su Jiaji pulled me into the inspection room. The walls, tables, and floors were covered with various instruments, some weighing dozens of kilograms and others small enough to be held in the palm of your hand. I listened quietly with my ear to the meter, and opened the cover to observe carefully, only to see countless small gears turning tick-tock. Shen Honggen, the twenty-three-year-old deputy chief of the inspection section, ran over excitedly to explain to me: "When comrades from the exploration team discover traces of mineral deposits in the remote mountains and fields, and drill wells thousands or hundreds of meters deep, what is the geological structure? What might the reserves be? Just use our electrical measuring instrument to measure it and you will know. How much coal and water is entering the high-temperature, high-pressure boiler? How much steam or waste gas is coming out? Is the coal burning well? Are too much or too little water and steam entering and exiting? Engineers sitting in the office can know by relying on our coal meters, flow recorders, and gas analyzers. In case of any danger, a warning will be received in advance..."

	"Is it really that sensitive?" I asked in surprise.

	"If it weren't sensitive, what would it be called the 'eyes' of industry?" Shen Honggen and Su Jiaji said with confidence. Indeed, the instruments produced by their factory have generally reached the international standard of error not exceeding 1.5%, and the sensitivity remains unchanged even when the pressure is as high as 320,000 grams per square centimeter or as low as 16 grams.

	This factory, including two private personnel, has only five technical personnel. Almost all of the original hundreds of large and small machine tools were driven by belts, and none of the errors met the standards. How could such a factory produce so many precision instruments?

	In the past, this factory produced ordinary products such as electric clocks and small water meters. Due to poor sales, the factory reduced production several times. As they themselves said, "We make what people don't want, and we can't make what people want." So they decided to manufacture instruments.

	Without drawings, without samples, and without customers, they started banging and clanging to trial-produce a flow meter recorder for the water plant. The design was revised again and again, and the parts were repaired again and again; without a computer, it took more than a month to calculate several curve formulas with an abacus. Without a large lathe, they raised the small lathe to use it; without a grinder, they ground it on the lathe; without calibration equipment, they used a lead bucket filled with water to hang on the roof beam to calibrate it. As a result, this instrument, which now seems to have a simple structure, took more than a year to explore back and forth, costing twenty times more working hours than now, and costing more than six times higher. Someone joked: "This is simply an exquisitely carved work of art!"

	Despite this, everyone never retreated. Technical personnel drilled into thermal instruments as if sharpening their heads, learning whatever they didn't understand; buying whatever drawings and materials they could buy, borrowing whatever they could borrow, and copying whatever they could copy; when encountering problems that could not be resolved in the factory, they went to teachers and classmates to ask for advice. At present, not only have the technical personnel changed from laymen to experts, but also seven workers have been promoted to technicians because they have improved their technical and theoretical level. Now, more than one hundred factories in Shanghai and many skilled manual laborers have cooperative relations with them. Many things that cannot be bought in the market are also delivered to their door. An electrical stall vendor on Zhifu Road often winds resistors for the factory, guaranteeing an error of no more than 0.5%. Almost all clock shops, consignment shops, and some second-hand stalls in the city automatically send Swiss "Omega" No. 3 wall clocks to the Xin Cheng Factory as soon as they receive them, without even mentioning the price.

	Recently, the number of employees in this factory has grown to nearly four hundred, an increase of nearly ten times compared to the original. The club and the ball field have been squeezed out, and there are queues for going to the toilet and the bathroom; without precision machine tools and calibration equipment, the scrap rate is still very high, and more advanced instruments cannot be trial-produced... These are all difficulties, and the biggest difficulty they feel is that they cannot resist the orders flying in from all over the country like snowflakes. Su Jiaji said to me: "New factories and mines must be put into production in advance, and old factories and mines are expanding one after another. The largest instrument factory is still being prepared in Xi'an, and we are squeezed here." He said that almost every day, several or even a dozen batches of customers came to order goods some time ago. Some came by plane hoping to buy spot goods and leave; some asked to order thousands of sets of instruments as soon as they opened their mouths. The factory couldn't cope with it, so they negotiated with the Shanghai Instrument Company and the Heavy Industry Bureau, and even found the city's leading organs, all arguing that their unit was a "key point" and that the order was urgently needed. The city's leading organs ranked them according to the importance and urgency, and they were ranked to 1958.

	According to Zhang Jiande, the director of this factory, the city's leadership has decided to focus on expanding this factory in accordance with the central government's policy of giving play to the role of Shanghai's industrial base. According to the preliminary expansion plan, this factory will be expanded into a new type of instrument factory covering 180 mu in the third quarter of next year, and the number of workers will also increase from the current 400 to more than 2,300. Many new machine tools will be added to the factory, and more complete laboratories and tool and heat treatment workshops will be added, as well as an assembly workshop that can maintain a certain temperature and is not contaminated by dust. More than fifty small factories that originally had cooperative relations will be merged in, bringing in some equipment and more than 800 employees who are familiar with this line of production. Production will be changed to two shifts, and the equipment utilization rate will be doubled; large-scale complete sets of production, the working hour quota can generally be reduced by 40%-50%. By then, the output will be eleven times higher than now, and more advanced instruments controlled by electron tubes with an error of no more than 0.5% will be trial-produced. Staff dormitories and other welfare facilities will also be expanded or newly built accordingly. The total investment for all these expansions is estimated to be only more than 4 million yuan, and all of it can be recovered within a year and a half.

	The director became more and more excited as he spoke, as if a new instrument factory was already in front of him.

	Socialist transformation has brought a beautiful future that many dilapidated lane factories in Shanghai did not dare to dream of in the past. This instrument factory is just one of them.

    一座“弄堂工厂”的变化
    徐行
    跨进厂门，清清楚楚地看到短墙上有着“公私合营上海新成电器厂”几个大字，我还疑惑是否跑错了地方。难道眼前这几间矮小而破旧的房屋，就是两年多来制成四十多种精密仪表，并且是我国目前唯一制造热工测量、调节仪表的工厂吗？我就在这样惊奇的心情下开始了访问。
    负责供销工作的苏家骥领我参观。他对我说：“别瞧不起我们这个占地只有七亩，破破烂烂的厂啊！我们的产品现在供应着全国一百多个重点建设厂矿；在玉门油矿分馏塔里；在鞍钢七号高炉上；在第一汽车厂锅炉房……处处都装着我们的仪表。第一汽车厂还给我们送一面锦旗呢！”我们的产品还去来比锡、苏联、印度展览过，并且也是出口物资哩！”
    苏家骥把我拉进检验室。墙上、台上、地上到处都挂着或摆着各种各样的仪表，大的有好几十公斤重，小的可以托在手掌上。我用耳朵贴在表上静听，又打开盖门仔细观察，只看到无数小齿轮在嘀嘀??地转动。二十三岁的检验科副科长沈洪根同志兴致勃勃地跑过来向我解释开了：“勘探队同志们在荒山野外探得了矿藏踪迹，钻下几千几百公尺深的井眼，究竟地层结构怎样？蕴藏量可能有多少？只要用我们的电测仪一测就知道了。高温、高压锅炉究竟进了多少煤、多少水？出了多少蒸汽或废汽？煤燃烧得好不好？水和蒸汽是否进出得太多或者太少了？坐在办公室里的工程师们，依靠我们的量煤器、流量纪录仪和气体分析器，就可知道。万一有什么危险的话，也会事先收到警报……”
    “真的这样灵吗？”我惊讶地问。
    “不灵那还叫什么工业上的‘眼睛’呢？”沈洪根、苏家骥都满有把握地这样说。的确，他们厂里出产的仪表一般都已达到误差不超过1.5％的国际水平，而且在每平方公分压力高到三十二万克或者低到十六克的情况下，灵敏度也始终不变。
    这个厂，包括两位私方人员在内，只有五名技术人员。原有上百台大大小小机床几乎全部靠皮带拖动，误差没有一台符合标准。像这样的一个工厂怎样会生产出这么多的精密仪表的呢？
    这个厂过去是造电钟、小水表等等普通产品的，由于销路不好，工厂几度减产。正像他们自己所说的：“我们做的人家不要，人家要的我们又做不了”。于是他们决心制造仪表。
    他们在一无图纸、二无样品、三无订户的情况下，就乒乒乓乓地试制起自来水厂用的流量计录仪来了。设计一改再改，零件一修再修；没有计算机，为求几道曲线公式竟用算盘拨了一个多月。没有大车床，就把小车床垫高起来用；没有磨床，就在车床上磨；没有校验设备，就用铅桶盛水吊上屋梁去校。结果，这只在现在看来结构还算简单的仪表竟前前后后摸索了一年多，比现在工时多花了二十倍，成本也高出六倍多。有人打趣地说：“这简直是精雕细刻的艺术品啊！”
    尽管如此，大家却从来没有退缩过。技术人员们都像削尖了头似的往热工仪表方面钻，不懂什么就学什么；碰到有关图纸和资料，能买就买，能借就借，能抄就抄；碰到厂内争论不决的问题，就分别去找老师、同学讨教。目前，不仅技术人员从外行变成了内行，并有七名工人因为提高了技术和理论水平，被提拔担任技师职务了。现在，上海市有一百多家厂和许多技艺精巧的手工劳动者和它们有协作关系。许多市场上根本买不到的东西也有人给送上门来。芝罘路上一位电器摊贩就经常替该厂绕电阻，可以保证误差不超过0.5％。差不多全市钟表店、寄售行和某些旧货摊贩，一收到瑞士“亚米茄”三号挂表，都会自动往新成厂送，连价钱都不用讲。
    最近，这个工厂职工人数已发展到近四百人，比原来增加了近十倍，俱乐部、球场都被挤掉了，上厕所和浴室也都挤得排起队；没有精密机床和校验设备，废品率还很高，更高级的仪表也试制不出来……这些都是困难，而他们最感困难的还是抵挡不住各地像雪片飞来的订货单。苏家骥就对我说：“新建厂矿要提前投入生产，老厂矿又纷纷扩建，最大的仪表厂还在西安筹备，我们这里可就轧扁头了。”他说，前些日子，差不多每天都有几批乃至十几批客户来订货。有的乘飞机来希望买到现货就走；有的一开口就要订上千套仪表。厂里应接不了，他们就到上海市仪表公司、重工业一局交涉，甚至找到市的领导机关，都争说自己的单位是“重点”，订货如何急需。市领导机关给他们按轻重缓急排了个队，就排到了1958年。
    据这个厂张建德厂长谈：市的领导上已经根据中央发挥上海工业基地作用的方针，决定重点扩建这个厂。按初步扩建计划，这个厂明年第三季度里将扩建成一座占地一百八十亩的新型的仪表工厂，工人也要由现在的四百人增加到两千三百多人。厂内要增加很多新式机床，要增设设备较为完善的试验室和工具、热处理等车间，还有一个可以保持一定温度、不受灰尘沾染的装配工场。五十多家原来就有协作关系的小厂将并进去，它们带进一部分设备和八百多个熟悉这一行生产的职工。生产改成两班制，设备利用率就提高一倍；大规模成套生产，工时定额一般都可降低40％—50％。到那时，产量将比现在提高十一倍，并将试制用电子管来控制的误差可以不超过0.5％的更高级的仪表。职工宿舍和其他福利设施也将相应地扩建或增建。所有这些扩建总共投资预计只需四百多万元就够了，并且在一年半之内就可全部收回。
    厂长越说越兴奋，仿佛一座新的仪表厂已经在他面前似的。
    社会主义改造给上海许多破破烂烂的弄堂工厂带来了过去所不敢梦想的美丽前程。这座仪表厂不过是其中之一而已。
