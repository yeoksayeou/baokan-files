Xinhua News Agency, October 16th. According to a report by the Yugoslav News Agency, the communiqué issued on the 15th regarding the Italian Communist Party delegation's visit to Yugoslavia noted with satisfaction that the contact between the representatives of the Italian Communist Party and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia has thus far yielded positive results. Therefore, the representatives of the two parties unanimously agreed to expand contact through various forms of cooperation. This will undoubtedly contribute to the positive efforts of the workers' movements and peoples of the two countries to further improve relations, and will also help to promote better understanding between the governments of the two countries.

The communiqué pointed out that the meetings and discussions between the representatives of the two parties were conducted in a friendly atmosphere and on an equal footing, with both sides frankly stating their opinions on all issues related to the two parties. These meetings reaffirmed that cooperation, exchange of opinions, and experience are beneficial for the interests of the workers' movements of the two countries, the development of socialism worldwide, and the improvement of relations between countries, as they help to clarify and assist in solving the important issues and tasks facing all progressive forces, especially the working-class parties, in the current situation.

The representatives of the two parties are clearly aware that such contact—as well as contact between other political and trade union groups of the working class—also makes a positive contribution to the development of good neighborly and friendly relations between the two countries, to the increasingly broad cooperation between the two parties on an equal footing, to solving today's political and economic problems, and to strengthening world peace.

Future cooperation between the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Italian Communist Party will be developed within the scope of proletarian internationalism, based on the principles of equality, open cooperation, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and mutual respect for each other's attitudes, even in cases where there are differences of opinion on individual issues; differences of opinion make it possible to engage in comradely criticism. The implementation of these principles will also help to develop cooperation with other working-class parties and groups that declare themselves to be striving for socialism, as well as with other progressive movements.

The communiqué concluded by saying that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia has accepted the invitation of the Italian Communist Party to send a delegation to attend the upcoming Italian Communist Party Congress.

    意共代表团访南公报指出
    两党同意进行合作扩大接触
    新华社16日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社报道，15日发表的意大利共产党代表团访问南斯拉夫的公报满意地指出，意大利共产党和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的代表们的截至现在为止的接触产生了积极的结果。因此，两党的代表们一致同意通过各种形式的合作来扩大接触。这无疑将有助于两国工人运动和人民进一步修好的积极努力，也有助于促进两国政府之间的更好的谅解。
    公报指出，两党代表们的会谈和讨论是在友好的气氛中、在平等的基础上进行的，双方坦率地陈述了和两党有关的一切问题的意见。这些会见再次证实，为了两国工人运动、全世界社会主义的发展、各国之间的修好的利益而进行合作、交换意见和经验是有益处的，因为这样做有助于澄清和帮助解决当前局势向一切进步力量，特别是向工人阶级政党提出的重要问题和任务。
    两党的代表们清楚地知道，这样的接触——还有工人阶级的其他政治团体和工会团体之间的接触——也对于两国间睦邻和友好关系的发展，对于两党在平等基础上进行愈来愈广泛的合作，对于解决今天的政治和经济问题和加强世界和平有积极的贡献。
    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和意大利共产党之间将来的合作将根据平等、公开合作、互不干涉党内生活、彼此尊重对方态度的原则，在无产阶级国际主义的范围内得到发展，甚至在个别问题上看法不一致的情况下也可以做到这一点，意见不同是有可能展开同志式的批评的。贯彻这些原则，也将有助于发展同宣告自己为社会主义而奋斗的其他工人阶级政党和团体以及同其他进步运动的合作。
    公报最后说，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟接受了意大利共产党的邀请，将派遣一个代表团参加即将召开的意大利共产党代表大会。
