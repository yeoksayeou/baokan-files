    Cultivation of New Kapok Varieties
    (Reported by this newspaper) An excellent new kapok variety, created by hybridizing "Youai" upland cotton and "Kaili" kapok, has been successfully cultivated at the Kaiyuan Kapok Experimental Station in Yunnan. Ordinary kapok only matures in winter, which limits its yield and promotion. This new variety matures about a month earlier and grows faster. Ordinary kapok only yields good harvests in the third year, but this new variety can yield more than 30 jin of cotton per mu in the first year. Moreover, the quality is also good. The Kaiyuan Kapok Experimental Station has trialed it under various conditions for three years, confirming that it is an excellent new kapok variety. (Zhang Jiechun)

    木棉新品种育成
    本报讯　“友爱”草棉和“开离”木棉杂交而成的优良的木棉新品种，在云南开远木棉试验站培育成功。普通木棉要到冬季才成熟，产量和推广都受到限制。这个新品种，成熟期提早一个月左右，生长也较快。普通木棉要到第三年才有好的收成，这个新品种第一年每亩就可收皮棉三十斤以上。而且品质也好。开远木棉试验站三年来在各种不同的条件下试种，证实了它是一种优良的新品种木棉。　（章皆淳）
