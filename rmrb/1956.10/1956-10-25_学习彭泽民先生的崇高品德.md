    Learning from Mr. Peng Zemin's Noble Character
    Liao Gailong
    A remarkable old man, the respected Mr. Peng Zemin, unfortunately passed away on October 18th. However, the many noble qualities he possessed as a staunch patriot will be immortal. He will forever live in the memories of millions of people.
    Mr. Peng Zemin dedicated his life to the cause of China's national liberation and the liberation of the Chinese people, fighting loyally and enthusiastically. As early as the beginning of this century, when he resided in Malaya, he actively participated in the activities of the Tongmenghui (Chinese United League) led by the great democratic revolutionary Sun Yat-sen, actively participating in the struggle to prepare for and realize China's first bourgeois democratic revolution (old democratic revolution) – the Xinhai Revolution. After the failure of this revolution, when the Chinese revolutionary camp presented a new look due to the emergence of the Chinese working class as an independent political force under the leadership of the Communist Party, he, as an active fighter of the revolutionary left wing of the Kuomintang, participated in the Chinese Great Revolution of 1924 to 1927. After this, Mr. Peng Zemin broke with Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, and others who embarked on the path of counter-revolution, and participated in the August 1st Nanchang Uprising led by the Chinese Communist Party. He followed this uprising army south to Guangdong. A year later, he went to Hong Kong. However, soon after, he and Mr. Deng Yanda and others organized the Provisional Action Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang outside of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, which was the predecessor of the China National Revolutionary Committee (also known as the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang). At the end of 1933, he arrived in Fujian from Hong Kong and participated in the Fujian Incident, which advocated resistance against Japan, alliance with the Communists, and opposition to Chiang. Despite suffering persecution from the Kuomintang and Japanese imperialism, and enduring the torment of poverty, Mr. Peng Zemin demonstrated the spirit of "poverty cannot make him swerve from principle, and force cannot subdue him," never deviating from his patriotic, democratic, and progressive stance. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Chinese People's Liberation War, he stood at the forefront of the patriotic democratic movement, actively supporting and participating in the great cause of saving the nation and the people led by the Chinese Communist Party.
    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, this old man who loved his country and loved his people seemed to become a young man again. He participated in various activities of the people's state with unprecedented enthusiasm. As one of the leaders of the China National Revolutionary Committee and the China Democratic League, he cooperated sincerely and closely with the Chinese Communists, contributing to the cause of consolidating and expanding the people's democratic united front.
    Mr. Peng Zemin embodied many of the excellent qualities possessed by the good people of China. Anyone who came into direct contact with him would have a strong feeling about this.
    My first acquaintance with Mr. Peng Zemin was in March 1952, when we jointly participated in the work of the Northeast Branch of the "Investigation Team on the Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by American Imperialism." At that time, the deep impression he gave me was that of a strong, clear-cut, and righteous old man.
    This investigation team was organized by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Red Cross Society of China. Its task was to conduct an objective on-site investigation of the heinous crimes of the American invading army in Korea dropping germ bombs in Korea and Northeast China starting in January 1952. The enemy was cunning, and in an attempt to evade condemnation by world opinion, they widely used "leaflet bombs" to drop deadly bacteria in order to conceal their crimes. At that time, we had to further find more indisputable evidence to expose the enemy's crimes. Initially, the Northeast Branch of the investigation team could only conduct post-event investigations of witnesses at the sites where the enemy dropped deadly bacteria. At this time, some friends became somewhat anxious due to this situation. However, Mr. Peng Zemin firmly believed that we would be able to find more evidence and believed that the evidence of eyewitnesses at the scene was very powerful. Sure enough, in addition to other evidence, a team led by entomologist Professor Liu Chongle discovered the wreckage of an oval-shaped germ bomb dropped by the enemy on March 20th in Kuandian County, near the Yalu River in Northeast China. At the same time, the Korean Branch of the investigation team also collected a large amount of factual evidence. This evidence was later confirmed by the International Scientific Commission and included in the commission's report. Mr. Peng Zemin was right, and the enemy's heinous crimes were finally exposed without a trace.
    The elderly Mr. Peng Zemin actively participated in all the activities of the investigation team at that time. He talked to many witnesses, delivered speeches to the gathered residents denouncing the enemy's crimes of bacteriological warfare, and went up and down mountains on foot to make on-site observations. He often walked ahead of some young people. Once, during an investigation near Zhenjiangshan in Andong, he finally fell ill due to overwork. After a subsequent examination, it was found that he had contracted pulmonary abscess. From then on, his health gradually deteriorated, affecting his longevity. From this, we can see how tirelessly Mr. Peng Zemin worked to defend the motherland and defend the cause of peace.
    Mr. Peng Zemin was a person who loved labor and worked tirelessly to serve the people. The reason why he was able to have such characteristics was because he loved his people, he was a revolutionary humanist. For many years, in addition to actively participating in revolutionary democratic political activities, he also actively participated in medical activities. He was a very accomplished practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. He had practiced medicine in Hong Kong for many years and had served as a specially appointed physician for workers in several factories. In the past few years, although he was busy with state affairs, he still took time every morning to see anyone who came to him for medical treatment, and he also served as a voluntary physician for a sanatorium of a military organ. In 1954, he treated an average of about six hundred patients per month. The small room he temporarily used as a clinic was often crowded with people seeking medical treatment. But no matter how many patients there were, he always treated them very carefully, often delaying his own meal times. He not only provided free medical treatment to those who came to him, but also often prepared medicinal pills and gave them to patients, and he and his wife personally decocted medicine for patients.
    In Mr. Peng Zemin's study, there were two characters "Bo Ai" (universal love), personally written for him by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. For these two characters, Mr. Peng Zemin can truly be said to be worthy of them.
    Mr. Peng Zemin was very strict with himself. His life was exceptionally simple. He grew flowers himself and always cared for and cherished the people's property. He even asked his children to take off their shoes before entering the carpeted living room, saying, "We must cherish the carpet - it is public property." He paid great attention to the education of his children, often asking and urging them to love the motherland, love the people, love the socialist cause, and strive to serve the people, and he himself indeed set such an example of how to live in front of his children.
    Although Mr. Peng Zemin had been plagued by illness for nearly a year, he still strived to participate in various state affairs activities recently. Not many days ago, he appeared in the welcoming line for President Sukarno, he also participated in the grand mass parade celebrating National Day, and he had multiple conversations with returning overseas Chinese representatives. He cheered for the resolution made by the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China to build a great socialist China, and expressed unparalleled indignation at the recent riots in Hong Kong where the British authorities shielded and condoned Kuomintang secret agent bandits. Mr. Peng Zemin's pulse was always connected and breathing in unison with the motherland and the people.
    Mr. Peng Zemin once said with a smile that he was only eighty years old, and that he wanted to see the victorious realization of a prosperous and happy communist society in China. During the period when Mr. Peng Zemin was seriously ill, he wrote a funeral couplet for himself, saying: "The overall situation is just beginning to flourish, how can one bear to say goodbye? Life is lively and vigorous, why be sad!" From this, one can see his infinite fondness for the motherland, which is flourishing and developing. In the minutes before his death, he happily said that he felt very good and thanked the doctors at Beijing Hospital who were treating him. A little later, when his condition suddenly deteriorated, he said: "Tongmenghui... Tongmenghui..." He was clearly recalling with satisfaction the great Chinese revolutionary cause that began with the Tongmenghui and has now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, brought about earth-shaking changes in China. He was clearly calling on the Chinese people to fight for the final completion of this great cause.

    学习彭泽民先生的崇高品德
    廖盖隆
    一个卓越的老人——敬爱的彭泽民先生，不幸在10月18日与世长辞了。但是，他作为一个坚贞的爱国者所具有的许多崇高的品德，将是不朽的。他会永远活在千百万人民的记忆中。
    彭泽民先生为了中国民族解放和中国人民解放事业，而忠诚地热忱地奋斗了一生。远在这个世纪的初头，当他侨居马来亚的时候，他就积极地参加了伟大的民主主义革命家孙中山先生所领导的同盟会的活动，积极地参加了准备和实现中国第一次资产阶级民主革命（旧民主主义革命）——辛亥革命的斗争。在这个革命失败以后，当中国的革命营垒因为中国工人阶级在共产党的领导下作为一个独立政治力量出现，而呈现了一个崭新的面貌的时候，他又作为中国国民党内的革命左翼的一个积极的战士，参加了1924年到1927年的中国大革命。在这以后，彭泽民先生同蒋介石、汪精卫这一批走上了反革命道路的人实行决裂，参加了中国共产党所领导的8月1日的南昌起义。他曾经随这支起义军南下，回到广东。一年之后他到了香港。但是不久之后，他又和邓演达先生等一道，在蒋介石的国民党之外组织了中国国民党临时行动委员会，这就是中国农工民主党的前身。1933年终，他从香港到达福建参加了主张抗日、联共、反蒋的福建事变。尽管他先后受到国民党、日本帝国主义的迫害，受到贫穷的折磨，但是彭泽民先生却表现了“贫贱不能移，威武不能屈”的大无畏精神，始终没有离开过爱国的民主的进步的立场。在抗日战争时期和中国人民解放战争时期，他都站在爱国民主运动的前列，积极地支持了和参加了中国共产党所领导的救国救民的伟大事业。
    中华人民共和国成立之后，这位热爱祖国、热爱人民的老人，好像变成一个青年人了。他以空前奋发的热情参加了人民国家的各种活动。作为中国农工民主党和中国民主同盟的领导者之一，他同中国共产党人进行了真诚无间的合作，对于巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线的事业，作出了贡献。
    彭泽民先生的身上，集中了中国的善良人民所具有的许多优秀的品质。凡是同他直接接触过的人，对这点都会有很强烈的感觉。
    我同彭泽民先生初次认识，是在1952年3月间，我们共同参加“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团的工作的时候。他当时给我的深刻的印象，就是这是一个坚强的、爱憎分明的、富有正义感的老人。
    这个调查团是由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国红十字会组织的，它的任务是对从1952年1月起美国侵略朝鲜的军队在朝鲜和中国的东北投掷细菌弹的滔天罪行进行客观的实地调查。敌人是狡猾的，他们由于企图规避世界舆论的谴责，而广泛地使用了“传单弹”来投下杀人的细菌，以便掩饰他们的罪行。当时我们曾经必须进一步地找到更多的无可分辩的证据来揭露敌人的罪恶。开初，调查团东北分团只能限于在敌人投下杀人细菌的地点对证人进行事后的调查。这时，有一些朋友因为这种情况而产生了一些焦虑的情绪。但是彭泽民先生却坚信我们定能找到更多的证据，并且认为现场目击者的证据就是非常有力的。果然，除了其他的证据之外，由昆虫学家刘崇乐教授所率领的一个小组，3月20日在东北沿鸭绿江边的宽甸县发现了敌人所投下的一个椭圆形的细菌弹残骸。同时，调查团朝鲜分团也收集了大量的事实证据。这些证据后来都被国际科学委员会所确认，而收录在这个委员会的报告书里面。彭泽民先生是正确的，敌人的滔天罪行终于被揭露无遗了。
    高年的彭泽民先生当时非常积极地参加了调查团的一切活动。他和许多证人谈话，对聚集拢来的居民发表斥责敌人细菌战罪行的演说，徒步上山下山作现场的观察，他甚至常常走在一些年轻人的前头。有一次，在安东的镇江山附近作调查的时候，他终于因为劳累过度而生了病。经过后来的检查，知道他是得了肺痈症。从那时以后，他的健康状况便逐渐地变坏，以致影响了他的高寿。从这里可以看到，彭泽民先生为了保卫祖国和保卫和平的事业，多么地不辞辛劳。
    彭泽民先生是一个热爱劳动、努力不息地为人民服务的人。他所以能具有这样的特点，是因为他热爱自己的人民，他是一个革命的人道主义者。多年以来，他除了积极地参加革命民主的政治活动之外，还积极地参加了医疗事业的活动。他是一个很有造诣的中医师。他曾经在香港行医多年，并且曾经给几个工厂的工人们担任特任的医师。过去的几年间，他虽然忙于国务，仍然抽出每天上午的时间，给前来请求看病的无论是什么人看病，还给一个军事机关的疗养院担任义务医师。1954年，他平均每个月诊治的病人共有六百人次左右。前来看病的人常常挤满了他的一间临时作为诊疗室的小小的房间。但是不管病人多少，他总是非常认真地给他们诊治，并且常常耽误了他自己进膳的时间。他不单是义务地给前来求诊的人看病，而且常常配制药丸送给病人，他和他的夫人还亲自给病人煎药。
    在彭泽民先生的书房里，挂有孙中山先生为他亲笔书写的“博爱”两个字。对于这两个字，彭泽民先生真可以说是当之无愧了。
    彭泽民先生对于自己的要求是非常严格的。他的生活异常简朴，自己动手种花，时刻地关心和爱护人民的财产。他甚至要求他的儿女们要脱了鞋才走进铺有地毯的客厅里，他说：“要爱护地毯——这是公家的东西。”他是很注意对自己的子女的教育的，时常要求和督促他们要热爱祖国、热爱人民、热爱社会主义事业、努力为人民服务，而且他自己在子女们的面前的确是树立了这样地做人的模范。
    彭泽民先生虽然被疾病缠绕了将近一年，最近他仍然奋力参加了各种国务活动。不多几天以前，他还出现在欢迎苏加诺总统的行列中，他还参加检阅了国庆节的盛大的群众游行，并且和归国的华侨代表进行了多次的谈话。他为中国共产党第八次代表大会所作出的建设伟大的社会主义中国的决议而欢呼，为最近香港英国当局包庇和纵容国民党特务匪徒的骚乱而表示无比的愤慨。彭泽民先生同祖国和人民，始终是脉搏相连、呼吸与共的。
    彭泽民先生曾经笑着说过，他才只有八十周岁呢，他说他想看到繁荣和幸福的共产主义社会在中国的胜利实现。彭泽民先生得了重病的期间，给自己写了一副挽联说：“大局方兴，忍言归去？生机活泼，何用悲为！”从这里，可以看到他对于正在欣欣向荣地发展着的祖的无限喜欢的心情。在他临终以前的几分钟，他还愉快地说，他觉得很好，并且感谢给他治病的北京医院的医生。再后一些，当他的病情突然恶化的时候，他还说：“同盟会……同盟会……。”他显然是在满意地回忆由同盟会开始而到现在在共产党的领导下已经引起了中国的翻天覆地的变化的伟大的中国革命事业，他显然是在号召中国人民为着最后完成这个伟大的事业而斗争。
