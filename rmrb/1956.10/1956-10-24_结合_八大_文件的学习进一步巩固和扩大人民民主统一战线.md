    Combining the Study of the "Eighth National Congress" Documents to Further Consolidate and Expand the People's Democratic United Front
    Deng Chumin
    While continuing to strengthen the Party's unity, it is also necessary to continue to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front.
    How to manage the cooperative working relationship between Party members and non-Party intellectuals, and how to manage the cooperative working relationship between Communist Party members and capitalist personnel are two important links in how to continue to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front today. To further improve these two aspects of working relationships, the main thing is to use the method of persuasion and education, and regard education and study as the central work of the united front, that is, first of all, to clarify the issues in ideological understanding. This has gained favorable conditions after the convening of the Eighth National Congress of the Party. Chairman Mao pointed out in his opening speech: "The task of our congress is: to sum up the experience since the Seventh National Congress, to unite the whole Party, to unite all forces that can be united at home and abroad, and to strive to build a great socialist China." Then he pointed out: "While we continue to strengthen the unity of the whole Party, we must also continue to strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, and all people's organizations, and continue to consolidate and expand our people's democratic united front."
    This makes us realize that the task of the congress, based on the experience since the Seventh National Congress, not only requires the Party's unity and the people's democratic united front during the revolutionary period, but also requires continuing to strengthen the Party's unity and continue to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front in order to build a great socialist China.
    In particular, the political report of the congress, in the section on "The Political Life of the Country," gave us a strong basis for understanding the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" between the Party and the democratic parties. In the past, the democratic parties and non-Party democratic人士 felt excited and encouraged by the proposal of this policy, and sincerely supported it, but in terms of understanding, they always mechanically believed that any party represents certain class interests, and that when classes are eliminated, parties will inevitably be eliminated. If the social base (that is, the class base) of China's democratic parties is the national bourgeoisie, the upper petty bourgeoisie, and their intellectuals, then, after the completion of socialist transformation, the members of the national bourgeoisie and the upper petty bourgeoisie will become part of the socialist laborers, and the democratic parties will lose their social base and there will be no need for their existence. However, the political report of the congress clearly pointed out for us: After the completion of socialist transformation, after the members of the national bourgeoisie and the upper petty bourgeoisie become part of the socialist laborers, "the democratic parties will become the parties of this part of the laborers. Because the remnants of bourgeois ideology will persist for a very long time among this part of the laborers, the democratic parties will still need to continue to contact them, represent them, and help them transform for a very long time." This clarifies our ideological concerns on this issue.
    Only when the proletariat forms an alliance with the broad masses who can accept socialism can it form the dictatorship of the vast majority over the reactionary classes and realize socialism.
    In the hearts of democratic parties and non-Party democratic人士, there is also a ideological question: the issue of the relationship between the proletarian dictatorship and the people's democratic united front. In the past, people always mechanically believed that the people's democratic dictatorship at the present stage is essentially a form of proletarian dictatorship, then other classes, other parties, and non-Party democratic人士 should not participate in the government, that is to say, the people's democratic united front does not need to continue to exist. The political report of the congress also clearly pointed out in the section on "The Political Life of the Country": "The proletarian dictatorship not only requires the strong leadership of the proletariat over the state organs, but also requires the active participation of the broadest masses of the people in the state organs, and the two are indispensable. Only when the proletariat forms an alliance with the broad masses who can accept socialism can it form the dictatorship of the vast majority over the reactionary classes and realize socialism." Then, it quoted Lenin's teaching: "The dictatorship of the proletariat is a special form of class alliance between the proletariat, that is, the vanguard of the laborers, and the numerous non-proletarian strata of laborers (the petty bourgeoisie, small owners, peasants, intellectuals, etc.), or with the majority of laborers,... it is an alliance established for the ultimate construction and consolidation of socialism." Finally, it affirmed: "There is no doubt that the proletarian dictatorship is always a certain form of class alliance." This also solves the relationship between the proletarian dictatorship and the people's democratic united front in principle theoretically, further clarifying our ideological concerns.
    The issue of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" between the Party and the democratic parties and the issue of the relationship between the proletarian dictatorship and the people's democratic united front are essentially the same issue. This Eighth National Congress of the Party has clearly stipulated the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" in the resolution of the political report, which will not only play a huge role in promoting the work of further consolidating and expanding the people's democratic united front in terms of understanding, but will also definitely play a huge role in practice, in creating systems and various specific measures.
    "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is the freedom of the people in the arts and sciences.
    What is also worth pointing out is that this congress once again put forward the Party's policy of "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" for artistic and scientific work. Since the Party put forward the policy of "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" not long ago, some people still have some ideological confusion in their understanding of this policy. Some people regard "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" as without direction, without leadership, and without scope. Merely because the person in charge of the Party has a sentence in his published article: "The Party advocates and promotes materialism, but also allows the freedom to promote idealism," they ignore the Party's general line for the transition period, which is to transition to socialism, ignore the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which was unanimously adopted by the National People's Congress, is the specific manifestation of the general line, and even ignore the important premises indicated by Chairman Mao that "the core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China" and "the theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism," thinking that the meaning of "let a hundred schools of thought contend" is not only to contend, but also to contend wildly. The ideological confusion caused by this not only violates the policy of "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," but also affects the unity on the artistic and scientific fronts, so that it is impossible to unite all the forces that can be united among the intellectuals and mobilize all the factors that can be mobilized to serve the socialist cause, thereby promoting academic prosperity and promoting cultural progress. Then, what exactly does the policy of "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" include? The political report of the congress clearly pointed out in the section on socialist construction regarding "cultural education": "In order to prosper our country's science and art and make them serve socialist construction, the Central Committee of the Party has put forward the policy of 'let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend.' Scientific truth becomes clearer with debate, and artistic styles must be inclusive. The Party should not rely on administrative orders to realize its leadership on academic and artistic issues, but should advocate free discussion and free competition to promote the development of science and art." At the same time, it pointed out: "We must arm intellectuals and the masses of the people with socialist and Marxist-Leninist ideology, and criticize feudal and capitalist ideology. ... We must continue to strengthen the work on the ideological front. ... We must use the strength of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals to build socialism, and we must learn from them. However, we should not allow the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas they bring to erode the ranks of the proletariat. On the contrary, we must do everything possible to help them transform into new intellectuals who are closely integrated with the working people. ... In the future, our task is to continue to implement the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, improve the use of intellectuals, and enable them to serve the great construction cause of the motherland more effectively." In this way, the Party should not rely on administrative orders to implement its leadership on academic and artistic issues, but should advocate free discussion and free competition, which is the main content of the policy of "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." It is not that leadership is not needed, let alone that there is no direction and no scope. On the contrary, we must first clearly recognize that this policy is only applicable within our people. Our country is a people's democratic dictatorship, essentially a proletarian dictatorship. We are building socialism. We must exercise dictatorship over counter-revolutionaries, while within the people, there is full democracy and freedom in politics, economics, and academic thought. "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is the freedom of the people in the arts and sciences. This is conducive to unity on the artistic and scientific fronts, and this is conducive to the consolidation and expansion of the people's democratic united front. This also first requires us to clarify the chaotic phenomena existing in the minds of some people regarding the policy of "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend."
    The policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" and the policy of "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" have always been ideological issues existing in the people's democratic united front, and theoretically speaking, they are more complex issues. I believe that only when some complex theoretical problems in the people's democratic united front are completely resolved can our work confidence and sense of responsibility be strengthened accordingly. The documents of this Eighth National Congress of the Party have completely solved such problems for us, especially the political report of the congress, which not only involves many aspects of the domestic situation in our country, especially the people's democratic united front at home, but also has important significance in international affairs, especially in matters related to the international united front. More than a thousand Party representatives gathered together, bringing to the congress the unprecedented characteristics of Party unity and domestic unity. Representatives of fraternal parties from fifty-six countries traveled across the ocean to participate in the congress, bringing to the congress the extraordinary characteristics of international unity. This shows that People's China and the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union are not isolated. They are all on the side of the powerful ranks of superior communists. Unity is strength. I believe that as long as we earnestly study the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, and combine study with raising the level of ideological understanding, thoroughly solve some of the more complex theoretical problems related to the people's democratic united front, and strengthen our work confidence and sense of responsibility, we will definitely be able to gradually reduce and even eliminate the class contradictions reflected in the business, work, and academic research of institutions, schools, and enterprises; we will definitely be able to gradually change all the different positions, viewpoints, and methods, different thoughts, and styles in observing and handling problems, so as to achieve consistency in politics and ideology. In this way, our People's Democratic United Front will inevitably be further consolidated and expanded. (To be continued)

    结合“八大”文件的学习进一步巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线
    邓初民
    在继续加强党的团结的时候，还必须继续巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线
    如何搞好党内和党外知识分子间的合作共事关系，以及如何搞好共产党员和资方人员之间的合作共事关系，这是今天如何继续巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线的两个重要环节。要使这两方面的工作关系进一步地加以改善，主要是使用说服教育的方法，把教育和学习工作当作统一战线工作的中心工作，亦即首先要把思想认识方面的问题加以澄清。这在党的第八次全国代表大会召开以后获得了有利条件。毛主席在开幕词中，首先指出：“我们这次大会的任务是：总结从七次大会以来的经验，团结全党，团结国内外一切可能团结的力量，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义的中国而奋斗。”接着指出：“在我们继续加强全党的团结的时候，我们还必须继续加强各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体的团结，继续巩固和扩大我们的人民民主统一战线”。
    这就使我们认识到大会的任务，根据七次大会以来的经验，不仅在革命时期需要党的团结，需要人民民主统一战线，而且，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义中国，更必须继续加强党的团结，继续巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线。
    特别是大会的政治报告，在“国家的政治生活”一项中，对党与各民主党派“长期共存，互相监督”的方针，给了我们认识上的有力根据。过去各民主党派和无党派民主人士，对于这一方针的提出，是感到兴奋和鼓舞的，而且是竭诚拥护的，但在认识上总是机械地认为任何党派都是代表一定的阶级利益的，阶级消灭，党派必然会跟着消灭，如果中国各民主党派的社会基础（亦即阶级基础）是民族资产阶级、上层小资产阶级和他们的知识分子，那么，在社会主义改造完成以后，民族资产阶级和上层小资产阶级的成员，都将成为社会主义劳动者的一部分，各民主党派就将失去它的社会基础而无存在的必要了；可是大会的政治报告却为我们明确指出：在社会主义改造完成以后，在民族资产阶级和上层小资产阶级的成员变成社会主义劳动者的一部分以后，“各民主党派就将变成这部分劳动者的政党。由于在这部分劳动者中，资产阶级思想的残余还会拖得很长，各民主党派还需要在一个很长的时间内继续联系他们，代表他们，并且帮助他们改造。”这就使我们在这个问题上的思想顾虑得到了澄清。
    无产阶级只有同广大的、可以接受社会主义的群众结成联盟，才能形成最大多数人对于反动阶级的专政，才能实现社会主义
    在民主党派和无党派民主人士的心中，还存在着一个思想问题：就是无产阶级专政与人民民主统一战线之间的相互关系问题。过去人们总是机械地认为现阶段的人民民主专政，实质上是无产阶级专政的一种形式，那么，就不应有其他阶级、其他党派和无党派民主人士参加政权，那么，也就是说，人民民主统一战线就不需要继续存在了。大会的政治报告在“国家的政治生活”一项中，也为我们明确指出：“无产阶级专政不但需要无产阶级对于国家机关的坚强领导，而且需要最广大的人民群众对于国家机关的积极参加，二者缺一不可。无产阶级只有同广大的可以接受社会主义的群众结成联盟，才能形成最大多数人对于反动阶级的专政，才能实现社会主义”。接着引证列宁的遗教说：“无产阶级专政，是无产阶级，即劳动者先锋队与人数众多的非无产者劳动阶层（小资产阶级，小业主，农民，知识界等等），或与大多数劳动者建立的特式阶级联盟，……是为最终建成并巩固社会主义而建立的联盟。”最后，肯定地指出：“无产阶级专政总是一定形式的阶级联盟，这一点是无可怀疑的。”这又从理论上原则性地解决了无产阶级专政与人民民主统一战线之间的相互关系问题，使我们的思想顾虑进一步得到了澄清。
    党与各民主党派“长期共存，互相监督”的问题和无产阶级专政与人民民主统一战线之间的相互关系问题，实质上是一个问题。这次党的八次代表大会把“长期共存，互相监督”的方针，已明确地规定在政治报告的决议中，这不仅对进一步巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线的工作，会在认识上起巨大的推动作用，而且一定会在实践中，在创建制度和各种具体措施中起巨大的推动作用。
    “百花齐放，百家争鸣”就是人民内部在艺术和科学工作上的自由
    还有值得指出的是：这次大会再一次提出了党对艺术和科学工作的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。自从党在不久以前提出了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针以后，直到现在某些人对于这一方针的认识，也仍然存在着某种思想上的混乱。有人把“百花齐放，百家争鸣”看作是无方向、无领导、无范围的。仅仅因为党的负责人在他所发表的文章中有：“党是主张和宣传唯物主义的，但是也允许有宣传唯心主义的自由”这样一句话，就忽视了党所提出的过渡时期的总路线是要向社会主义过渡，忽视了全国人民代表大会所一致通过的中华人民共和国宪法，是总路线的具体表现，甚至忽视了毛主席所指示的“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党”，“指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义”等等重要前提，认为“百家争鸣”的涵义不但可以争鸣，而且可以乱鸣。这样所引起的思想混乱，不但违反了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，而且也影响到艺术和科学战线上的团结，以致不能在知识分子中团结一切可能团结的力量和调动一切可能调动的因素来为社会主义事业服务，从而促进学术繁荣，推动文化进步。那么，到底“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针包括一些什么内容呢？大会的政治报告在社会主义建设关于“文化教育”一项中，明确的指出：“为了繁荣我国的科学和艺术，使它们为社会主义建设服务，党中央提出了‘百花齐放，百家争鸣’的方针。科学上的真理是愈辩愈明的，艺术上的风格是必需兼容并包的。党对于学术性质和艺术性质的问题，不应当依靠行政命令来实现自己的领导，而要提倡自由讨论和自由竞赛来推动科学和艺术的发展。”同时指出：“我们要用社会主义的、马克思列宁主义的思想去武装知识分子和人民群众，对封建主义的、资本主义的思想进行批判。……我们必须继续加强思想战线上的工作。……我们必须运用资产阶级和小资产阶级的知识分子的力量来建设社会主义，并且要向他们学习。但是，我们不应当让他们所带来的资产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想侵蚀无产阶级的队伍，相反，我们要尽一切努力帮助他们转变为同劳动人民密切结合的新知识分子。……在今后，我们的任务就是要继续贯彻执行团结、教育、改造知识分子的政策，改善对于知识分子的使用，使他们更有效地为祖国的伟大建设事业服务。”这样看来，党对学术性质和艺术性质的问题不应当依靠行政命令来实行自己的领导，而要提倡自由讨论和自由竞赛，就是“百花齐放，百家争鸣”方针的主要内容。不是不要领导，更不是不要方向和没有范围，恰恰相反，我们首先必须明确认识这一个方针，只是在我们人民内部适用的。我国是一个人民民主专政的国家，实质上是一个无产阶级专政的国家，我们正在建设社会主义，我们要对反革命分子实行专政，而人民内部，则无论在政治上、经济上、学术思想上都有充分的民主与自由，“百花齐放，百家争鸣”就是人民内部在艺术和科学工作上的自由。这样才有利于艺术和科学战线上的团结，这样才有利于人民民主统一战线的巩固和扩大。这样也就首先要求我们要对“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，从某些人思想上存在着的混乱现象加以澄清。
      “长期共存，互相监督”的方针与“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，过去一直是在人民民主统一战线中所存在的思想问题，而且从理论上说来是较为复杂的问题。我认为只有把人民民主统一战线中若干复杂的理论问题获得彻底解决，我们的工作信心和责任感才能随之加强。这次党的八次全国代表大会的文件，就为我们彻底解决了这样的问题，特别是大会的政治报告，不仅涉及我国国内形势的许多方面，尤其是国内人民民主统一战线方面，有着重大的意义；而且在国际事务中，尤其是有关国际统一战线的事务中也有着重大的意义。一千多党的代表聚集一堂，给大会带来了空前的党的团结和国内团结的特点，五十六个国家兄弟党的代表远涉重洋，参加大会，给大会带来了不平凡的国际团结的特点，这说明人民中国及以苏联为首的社会主义各国并不是孤立的，它们都处在优胜的共产主义者的强大队伍的一边。团结就是力量，我相信只要我们认真学习党的八大文件，并结合学习，提高思想认识水平，彻底解决有关人民民主统一战线中若干较为复杂的理论问题，加强我们的工作信心和责任感，我们就一定能够把从机关、学校和企业的业务、工作和学术研究上反映出来的阶级矛盾，逐步减少以致消灭；就一定能够把观察和处理问题上所有的不同的立场、观点和方法，不同的思想和作风，逐步改变，以致达到政治上、思想上的一致。这样，我们的
  人民民主统一战线就必然会进一步巩固和扩大起来。　（续完）
