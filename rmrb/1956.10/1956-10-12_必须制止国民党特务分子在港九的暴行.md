    The Kuomintang Secret Agent's Atrocities in Hong Kong and Kowloon Must Be Stopped

    Taking advantage of the October 10th anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution, Kuomintang secret agents instigated large-scale riots and atrocities in Kowloon. From 11:30 AM on October 10th to the evening of October 11th, Kuomintang secret agents gathered thousands of thugs to attack and loot many schools, shops, and residences, even committing murder and arson, causing serious loss of life and property. The atrocities were still developing as of the evening of the 11th. We are deeply concerned about the safety of our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon and extend our sincere condolences to them. We express our utmost indignation at the Kuomintang secret agents' atrocities that endanger our Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots. We cannot but express our extreme regret that Kuomintang secret agents and thugs were able to openly and systematically harass, set fire to, loot, and endanger schools, shops, and residents on a large scale in Kowloon.

    The riots have not yet ended, and Kuomintang secret agents are still active everywhere. The Hong Kong branch of the Xinhua News Agency was still surrounded by thugs on the evening of the 11th, and the safety of some institutions and enterprises is still threatened by the thugs. When some institutions and enterprises were attacked by thugs, they requested protection from the Hong Kong security authorities, but did not receive timely and effective protection, resulting in serious losses. The Chinese people cannot but protest against this irresponsible attitude of the British authorities in Hong Kong.

    One cannot help but ask, why have the atrocities of the Kuomintang secret agents been able to continue for so long and expand to half of the Kowloon area? Judging from many reports, the British authorities in Hong Kong did not take precautions against the Kuomintang secret agents' major atrocities in advance, nor did they take effective measures to stop them in time after the atrocities began, allowing the Kuomintang secret agents to unscrupulously coerce other thugs to expand the atrocities. The more fundamental reason for the occurrence of this atrocity lies in the fact that the British authorities in Hong Kong have long tolerated Kuomintang secret service organizations using Hong Kong and Kowloon to carry out activities that endanger the Chinese people and endanger peace. Everyone remembers the April 11, 1955, incident in which Kuomintang secret agents sabotaged the "Kashmir Princess" plane. After the "Kashmir Princess" plane was sabotaged, the Chinese government, based on the British authorities' willingness to cooperate in solving the case, provided the British authorities in Hong Kong with a large amount of information on Kuomintang secret agents related to the sabotage case. However, the British authorities in Hong Kong did not thoroughly investigate the case, but released a group of secret agents who had been arrested, which fueled the arrogance of the Kuomintang secret agents. It is no accident that the Kuomintang secret agents are so rampant today.

    Now the atrocities have not ended, and the vast number of Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon are still threatened and harmed by Kuomintang secret agents. If the British authorities in Hong Kong cannot deal with it effectively, the riots will continue, which will seriously damage the security and reputation of Hong Kong. The vast majority of residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon are Chinese compatriots, and Hong Kong and Kowloon are very close to the mainland. It is only natural that the Chinese people and the Chinese government are very concerned about the riots that are happening here. We will pay attention to what attitude the British authorities in Hong Kong take towards the Kuomintang secret agents and whether they can take responsibility for the security of Hong Kong and Kowloon.

### 必须制止国民党特务分子在港九的暴行

    必须制止国民党特务分子在港九的暴行
    国民党特务分子，利用10月10日辛亥革命纪念日的机会，在九龙制造了大规模的骚乱和暴行。从10日上午十一时三十分到11日晚间，国民党特务分子纠集了数千暴徒对许多学校、商店、居民进行了袭击、抢劫，甚至杀人纵火，造成生命财产的严重损失。直到11日晚暴行还在继续发展中。我们对于港九同胞的安全深为关切，并向他们表示亲切的慰问。我们对于国民党特务分子危害港九同胞的暴行，表示万分愤慨。我们对于国民党特务分子和暴徒竟能在九龙公然地和有计划有组织地向学校、商店和居民进行大规模的骚扰，纵火，抢劫危害，不能不表示非常遗憾。
    目前骚乱尚未结束，国民党特务分子还在到处活动。我新华社香港分社11日晚还在暴徒包围中，一些机关、企业的安全还在受着暴徒们的威胁。有些机关企业在遭到暴徒们袭击时向香港治安当局要求保护，却并未得到及时的有效的保护，致使遭受了严重的损失。中国人民对于香港英国当局这种不负责任的态度，不能不表示抗议。
    人们不能不问，为什么国民党特务分子的暴行竟能继续如此之久并且扩大到半个九龙地区呢？从许多消息看来，香港英国当局对国民党特务分子的大暴行，事先既未预防，暴行开始后又未及时采取有效措施加以制止，使得国民党特务分子能够肆无忌惮地裹胁其它暴徒扩大了暴行。而发生这次暴行的更根本的原因还在于香港英国当局长期以来容忍国民党特务组织利用香港和九龙进行危害中国人民和危害和平的活动。大家都记得1955年4月11日国民党特务分子破坏克什米尔公主号飞机的事件。在克什米尔公主号飞机被破坏后，中国政府根据英国当局愿意合作破案的表示，曾向香港英国当局提供了与破坏案有关的大批国民党特务分子的材料。但是香港英国当局并未彻底追究破案，却把已经逮捕的一批特务分子释放，这就助长了国民党特务分子的气焰。今天，国民党特务分子竟然如此猖獗，决不是偶然的。
    现在暴行还未结束，广大的港九中国同胞还受着国民党特务分子的威胁和危害。香港英国当局如果不能够加以有效的处理，暴乱还会继续下去，这不能不严重损害香港的治安和名誉。香港九龙居民绝大多数是中国同胞，香港九龙和大陆近在咫尺，中国人民和中国政府对于在这里所发生的暴乱十分关切是当然的。我们将注意香港英国当局对国民党特务分子采取什么态度，是否能负起港九治安的责任。
