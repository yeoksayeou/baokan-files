Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 4th: Czechoslovakia's social insurance system will become the most advanced in the world today, second only to the Soviet Union.

The Prague newspapers yesterday published the suggestions of Supka, Chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions, regarding the re-formulation of the social insurance system, which he reported at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and which have already been approved by the meeting.

Supka's suggestions pointed out that the government will universally improve the social insurance benefits enjoyed by the working people in cases of illness, childbirth, old age, and loss of working ability, and eliminate the unreasonable historical regulations that gave staff and office workers higher social insurance benefits than workers.

The new social insurance system stipulates that the sickness benefits received by employees when they are unable to work due to illness will generally be increased. More than two-thirds of all employees who are unable to work due to illness and therefore have no wage income will be able to receive a subsidy equivalent to 90% of their original (after income tax) wage. The remaining employees can also receive different amounts of subsidies. Because the minimum amount of the subsidy will be increased from three crowns (Czech currency) per day to sixteen crowns, they can be guaranteed a minimum monthly income of four hundred and eighty crowns. The maximum limit of the subsidy will also be increased from one thousand one hundred crowns per month to two thousand three hundred and forty crowns.

The amount of pensions and disability benefits has also been increased. They will reach 50% to 85% or even 90% of the employees' original (before income tax) wages.

Regarding the retirement age, the new regulations generally allow employees to enjoy pension benefits five years earlier. Female employees who are 55 years of age and male employees in certain important industries who have 20 years of service can retire and receive pension benefits. The retirement age for other employees has also been reduced from 65 to 60. Those who have reached retirement age and are willing to continue working can receive an additional one-third of their pension in addition to their salary; if they are over 65 (female employees and male employees in important industries are over 60), they can receive the full pension in addition to their salary.

Maternity leave remains the same as in the past, at eighteen weeks, but the amount of maternity benefits has increased, and the amount of benefits for widows and orphans has also increased.

The new insurance system stipulates that the children of individual farmers can also enjoy free treatment when they need to be hospitalized. The medical expenses for childbirth for the wives of individual farmers are also provided by the state.

Due to the improvement of the social insurance system, the Czechoslovak government will increase its expenditure by one billion crowns per year in the future.

    进一步提高劳动人民的福利
    捷将实行新的社会保险制度
    新华社布拉格4日电　捷克斯洛伐克的社会保险制度将成为今日世界上除苏联以外最先进的社会保险制度。
    布拉格的报纸昨天刊载了工会中央理事会主席苏普卡最近在捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会全体会议上报告的并且已经获得会议通过的关于重新制定社会保险制度的建议。
    苏普卡的建议指出，政府将普遍提高劳动人民在疾病、生育、老年和丧失工作能力时所享受的社会保险福利，取消历史上遗留下来的职员在享受社会保险待遇方面高于工人的不合理规定。
    新的社会保险制度规定：职工在患病不能工作时领取的疾病补助金一般地将予以增加。全部职工的三分之二以上在患病不能工作因而没有工资收入的情况下，将可以得到相当于他们原有（扣除所得税）工资的90％的补助金。其余的职工也可获得不同数量的补助金。由于补助金的最低额将由每天三克朗（捷币名）提高为十六克朗，他们至多可以保证每月收入不低于四百八十克朗。补助金的最高限额也将由每月一千一百克朗提高到二千三百四十克朗。
    养老金和丧失工作能力者的补助金额也提高了。它们将达到职工原有的（未扣所得税）工资的50％到85％甚至90％。
    关于退休的年龄，新的规定使职工一般地可以提前五岁享受养老金待遇。年满五十五岁的女性职工以及某些重要行业中的男性职工已经有二十年工龄者就可以退休领取养老金。其他职工的退休年龄也由六十五岁提前为六十岁。达到退休年龄而愿意继续工作的人，除工资外可以再领取三分之一的养老金，如果他们已经年逾六十五岁（女性职工和重要行业中的男性职工年逾六十岁），则除工资外可以再领取全部养老金。
    产妇仍和过去一样，可以休假十八个星期，但产妇的补助金额增加了，寡妇和孤儿的补助金额也增加了。
    新的保险制度规定，个体农民的子女在需要住医院治疗时也可以享受免费待遇。个体农民的妻子生育时的医药费用也由国家供给。
    由于社会保险制度的改进，捷克斯洛伐克政府今后每年将增加十亿克朗的支出。
