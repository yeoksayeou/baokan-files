Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, held a banquet at the Beijing International Club on the evening of the 9th to welcome all members of the Japanese Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade Delegation.

In his speech at the banquet, Zhang Xiruo said that the Japanese Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade has made considerable efforts and achieved certain successes in promoting Sino-Japanese trade and increasing mutual understanding between the Chinese and Japanese people. The reason why the trade agreements signed in the past were not fulfilled according to the agreed amount was mainly due to the artificial obstacles created by the so-called embargo. He believes that with the efforts of people all over the world, especially the Japanese people and Japanese business circles, the embargo will be abolished one day. He said that the development of trade will also have a positive impact on the normalization of relations between China and Japan. Zhang Xiruo raised his glass to congratulate the further development of trade between China and Japan and the early normalization of relations between the two countries.

Ikedo Masanosuke, the head of the Japanese Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade Delegation, spoke at the banquet, expressing his gratitude to Chinese friends for inviting the delegation to visit China. Ikedo Masanosuke said that the Japanese Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade Delegation is willing to continue its efforts to fulfill its past promise to invite a delegation from the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to visit Japan. He said that Japan has political difficulties on this issue, but Japan is an independent country and an autonomous nation, and it is by no means a dependency of the United States. He said that not only the Japanese Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade Delegation believes, but also the Japanese people all believe that they can overcome all difficulties and build a peaceful world together with the people of the world. He said that Japan is moving forward steadily, and is willing to move forward as soon as possible. We are willing to invite representatives of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and invite all of you present to visit Japan one day in the future. Ikedo Masanosuke finally raised his glass to toast the realization of this promise.

Those present at the banquet tonight included Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Yang Yu, Director of the China Fisheries Association, as well as Luo Longji, Liao Chengzhi, Lei Renmin, Li Zhuchen, Qiao Guanhua, Chen Hansheng, Lu Xuzhang, and Japanese people in Beijing, such as Kameta Togo.

    新华社9日讯　中国人民外交学会会长张奚若为欢迎日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟代表团全体人员，9日晚在北京国际俱乐部举行宴会。
    张奚若在宴会上致词说，日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟在促进中日贸易和增加中日人民彼此了解方面作了不少的努力，并且取得了一定的成就。过去签订的贸易协定没有按额完成，主要原因是所谓禁运的人为障碍造成的。他相信在全世界人民、特别是日本人民和日本工商界人士的努力下，总有一天能够废除禁运。他说，贸易的发展对中日两国关系的正常化也有良好的影响。张奚若举杯祝贺中日两国贸易的进一步发展和中日两国关系早日正常化。
    日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟代表团团长池田正之辅在宴会上讲了话，他对中国朋友邀请日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟代表团来中国访问表示感谢。池田正之辅说，日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟代表团愿意继续努力，以实现过去许下的邀请中国人民政协代表访问日本的诺言。他说，在这个问题上日本在政治上有困难，但是日本是独立的国家、自主的民族，她绝不是美国的附属国。他说，不仅是日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟代表团相信，而且日本全国人民都相信能够突破一切困难，和全世界人民一起建设一个和平的世界。他说，日本正在稳步前进，并且愿意尽快地前进，我们愿意将来有一天能邀请中国人民政协的代表，并且邀请在座的诸位到日本访问。池田正之辅最后举杯祝为实现这一诺言而干杯。
    今晚出席宴会作陪的有中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸，中国渔业协会主任杨煜以及罗隆基、廖承志、雷任民、李烛尘、乔冠华、陈翰笙、卢绪章和在北京的日本人士龟田东伍等多人。
