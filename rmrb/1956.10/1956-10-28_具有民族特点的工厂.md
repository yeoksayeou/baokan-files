Factories with National Characteristics
    Yang Baiyuan

    Among the state-owned industries in Yanbian, Jilin Province, there are many factories with national characteristics. The Yanbian Farm Tool Factory, Yanbian Rubber Factory, and Yanbian Knitting Factory in Yanji City, the capital of the autonomous prefecture, are three of the more outstanding ones.

    The Yanbian Farm Tool Factory specializes in manufacturing farm tools for paddy fields. Before liberation, it had only fifty-odd workers, and its equipment was very simple, capable of producing only a small amount of Western plows and Korean pots. Now, it is a factory with over four hundred workers using machine operations. Since 1952, it has produced paddy field weeders, walking plows, and foot-operated rice threshers. Last year, it successfully trial-produced five products: animal-powered rice threshers, combined rice threshers, powered rice threshers, single-furrow wheel-less plows, and water pumps. The foot-operated rice thresher is a rice thresher that rotates smoothly, is durable, and easy to disassemble, and has already received praise from farmers in many paddy field areas across the country. People from paddy field areas in Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces have come to the factory to place orders. In the first half of this year alone, more than forty people came to the factory to place orders, and there were more than 120 orders received by mail and telegram.

    The Yanbian Rubber Factory was originally a state-owned factory located in Shenyang. To meet the special needs of the Korean people, it was moved to Yanbian in 1950 and placed under local management. At present, the factory buildings and machinery and equipment have been greatly increased, and the number of employees has grown from 140 to about 700. The annual output has reached more than 1.7 million pairs, more than thirteen times higher than in 1949. In addition to various colored sneakers and sports shoes, the products also include men's and women's pure rubber shoes specially produced for the Korean ethnic group, cotton rubber shoes suitable for forest workers and miners, and water socks (industrial shoes). Water field work boots are currently being trial-produced. Because the early spring in the north is relatively cold, many Korean farmers suffer from lower back and leg pain and women suffer from gynecological diseases when working barefoot in paddy fields. The successful trial production of paddy field work boots will bring good news to the Korean people.

    The Yanbian Knitting Factory originally had more than thirty workers, two sewing machines, two circular knitting machines, and several hand-cranked machines. At that time, it could only produce simple spring and autumn clothing. Now, it has more than four hundred workers, with an increase of 58 various machines and equipment, becoming one of the largest knitting factories in Jilin Province. The output of the factory's main products, spring and autumn clothing and trousers, has increased by about tenfold, and the styles of various products have increased to several hundred.

    Before liberation, farmers in the Yanbian area were "allotted" less than one pair of rubber shoes every few years and had to work in the fields wearing straw sandals or barefoot. Women who occasionally got a pair of pure rubber shoes treasured them as if they had obtained a treasure, and were reluctant to wear them easily, often carrying the shoes on their heads when walking. Now, the Korean people can freely buy all kinds of rubber shoes and knitwear they like in the market. It is the first time in history that Korean farmers have used domestically produced paddy field farm tools to cultivate the land. Brothers and sisters of all ethnic groups living in the big family of national equality in the motherland have not only achieved equal status in politics, but also received special care from the state in their economic lives. Yanbian area has its own national industry, which is a glorious achievement of the Chinese Communist Party's national policy.

    具有民族特点的工厂
    杨柏橼
    在吉林延边地方国营工业中，有不少具有民族特点的工厂。在自治州首府延吉市的延边农具厂、延边橡胶厂和延边针织厂就是比较出色的三个厂。
    延边农具厂，是专门制造水田农具的。解放以前仅有五十多个工人，设备非常简单，只能生产少量的洋犁和朝鲜锅。现在已经是一个拥有四百多工人和使用机器操作的工厂了。从1952年起，它就生产水田除草器、步犁和脚踏式打稻机，去年又试制成功了畜力打稻机、联合打稻机、动力打稻机、无轮一铧犁和扬水机等五种产品。脚踏式打稻机是一种回转轻快、经久耐用、拆卸方便的打稻机，已经获得全国不少水田地区农民的好评。辽宁、河北、山东、山西等省水田地区都有人来厂订货，仅在今年上半年来厂订购的就有四十多人，来信和用电报订货的一百二十多起。
    延边橡胶厂原来是设在沈阳的一个国营工厂，为了满足朝鲜族人民的特殊生活需要，才于1950年迁来延边，划归地方经营。目前厂房和机器设备已大量增加，职工人数已由一百四十人发展到七百人左右；年产量已经达到一百七十多万双，比1949年多十三倍多。产品除有各种颜色的球鞋、运动鞋外、还有专为朝鲜族生产的男女纯胶鞋，适合于森林工人、采矿工人穿用的棉胶鞋和水袜子（工业用鞋）。现在正在试制水田工作靴。因为北方早春较冷，朝鲜族农民赤脚在水田工作，患腰腿痛病和女子得妇女病的很多。水田工作靴试制成功以后，将会给朝鲜族人民带来福音。
    延边针织厂原来有三十多个工人、两台缝纫机、两台圆机和数台手摇机。当时只能生产简单的春秋衣。现在它已拥有四百多工人，各种机器设备增加五十八台，成为吉林省规模最大的针织厂之一。这个厂主要产品春秋衣、裤产量已经增加十倍左右，各种产品样式增加到数百种之多。
    解放前，延边地区的农民，几年“配给”不到一双的胶鞋，不得不穿着草鞋或光着脚下地干活。妇女们偶尔得着一双纯胶鞋，如获至宝，轻易舍不得穿，走路时也常常把鞋顶在头上。现在，朝鲜族人民可以在市场上随意买到自己所喜爱的各种胶鞋和针织品。朝鲜族农民使用自产的水田农具耕种土地，在历史上还是第一次。生活在祖国民族平等的大家庭中的兄弟民族，不仅在政治上得到了平等的地位，在经济生活中也得到了国家的特别照顾。延边地区有自己的民族工业，这是中国共产党民族政策的光荣成果。
