Xinhua News Agency, October 15th. Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen hosted a reception this evening to see off the Belgian Kingdom Parliamentary Delegation, which is about to leave Beijing to return home.

Premier Zhou Enlai attended the reception, had cordial conversations with the delegation members, and toasted them individually.

Mayor Peng Zhen said at the reception that the Belgian Kingdom Parliamentary Delegation's visit had increased understanding between China and Belgium and promoted friendship between the two peoples, for which we express our gratitude.

Peng Zhen said that there are no conflicting interests between our two peoples, only deep friendship. The delegation has already seen this deep friendship during their visits to various places. Please take the friendship of the people of the capital and all the Chinese people to the Belgian people back with you, and wish that the friendship between our two countries will continue to develop and increase.

The head of the Belgian Kingdom Parliamentary Delegation, Mr. Housman, then spoke. He said humorously: Before we leave, I will tell you a secret. I must constantly maintain order among my friends and tell them not to leave this place.

Housman said that between the peoples of Belgium and China, whether from a political or personal perspective, there are no differences. From a political perspective, you want to carry out revolution, and we also want to carry out revolution; you want peace, and we also want peace.

Housman pointed out that this visit to China has given the delegation a new understanding of China. He also said that we have become very accustomed to living and traveling in China.

Housman said that your country is very large, as large as Europe, and has a long history, which makes us happy. He said that your country has your greatness, and our country also has our greatness.

Also present at the reception tonight were Li Jishen, Shen Junru, and Chen Shutong, vice-chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and some members, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and heads of other relevant government departments, Vice Mayors of Beijing Zhang Youyu, Cheng Hongyi, Jia Tingsan, and Le Songsheng, Chairman of the Beijing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Liu Ren and various vice-chairmen, heads of various departments of the Beijing Municipal Government and people's organizations, and people from all walks of life.
