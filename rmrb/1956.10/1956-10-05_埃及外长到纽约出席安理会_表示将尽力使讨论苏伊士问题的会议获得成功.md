Xinhua News Agency, New York, 4th: Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi arrived in New York on October 3rd to attend the United Nations Security Council meeting on the Suez Canal issue, scheduled for October 5th. Upon arrival, Fawzi stated that the Egyptian delegation would do its utmost to ensure the meeting's success. He expressed hope for useful and constructive efforts and that these efforts would not be in vain.

Fawzi met with United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov on the same day. After his meeting with Hammarskjöld, Fawzi told reporters that the Egyptian delegation was "willing to meet everyone, compare various opinions—regardless of who puts them forward—and consider these opinions if they are good ones."

British Foreign Secretary Lloyd is intensifying consultations with Western diplomats, seeking to establish a "united front" of Western countries in the Security Council. Currently, Britain and France are preparing a proposal whose core content remains a demand for the Security Council to agree to an "international control" plan for the Suez Canal, infringing upon Egyptian sovereignty. According to reports, the draft resolution being prepared by Britain and France has essentially received the approval of the United States.

The majority of Security Council members currently advocate resolving the Suez issue through negotiations. According to a United Press International report, on the eve of the Security Council meeting, there is a "strong sentiment" for the establishment of some kind of "negotiating mechanism" within the United Nations.

    埃及外长到纽约出席安理会
    表示将尽力使讨论苏伊士问题的会议获得成功
    新华社4日讯　纽约消息：埃及外交部长法齐10月3日到达纽约，准备出席定于10月5日举行的讨论苏伊士运河问题的联合国安全理事会会议，法齐在到达纽约后说，埃及代表团将尽力使会议获得成功，它希望会有有用的和建设性的努力，并且希望所作的努力不致会毫无好处。
    法齐这一天会见了联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德和苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫。法齐同哈马舍尔德会谈后对记者说，埃及代表团“愿意会见每一个人，比较各种意见——不论是谁提出来的——并且考虑这些意见，如果这些意见是好意见的话”。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德同西方的外交官员加紧进行协商，设法建立西方国家在安全理事会上的“联合阵线”。目前英法两国正在准备一项提案，它的基本内容仍然是要求安全理事会同意侵犯埃及主权的“国际管制”苏伊士运河计划。据报道，英法两国准备提出的决议草案基本上已经得到美国的同意。
    安全理事会大多数成员目前都主张通过谈判来解决苏伊士问题。据合众社消息说，在安全理事会开会的前夕，有一种要求在联合国范围内成立某种“谈判机构的强烈情绪”。
