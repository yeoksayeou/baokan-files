    Rambling Through the Book Forest
    On Visiting Books
    Xidi
    “There is always more grass beyond the horizon,” this sentence is most appropriate for book hunters. Where are there no good books, rare books, useful and beneficial books? As long as you have the heart to seek them out, you will surely find many good things. In the Guangzhou Library, I saw the Song Dynasty edition of Yang Chengzhai's Collection, which flowed back to Guangdong from Japan at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Yang Chengzhai's Collection has always only been seen in manuscript copies, never in Song Dynasty printed editions. Although this book is very tattered, it is a most exquisite treasure. The Guangzhou Library rescued it from a pile of books weighed and sold by the dan and jin. Now it is, the object has found its place. Guangdong Province sent it to the Beijing Library, making it one of the best Song Dynasty books there. Recently, the Wen Yuan Pavilion in Longfusi, Beijing, found many good manuscript books from Fujian, including a copy of Zhang Huang's "Illustrated Encyclopedia," which is a Ming Dynasty manuscript with color illustrations. I haven't carefully compared it with the Ming Dynasty printed edition yet, so I don't know the differences. But what is certain is that this manuscript is earlier than the printed edition, and the color illustrations are especially important. Although more than ten volumes are missing, the Beijing Library also collected it. I also obtained three volumes of "Records of Fujian Products" and two volumes of "One Hundred and One Records of Marine Creatures" (both written by Guo Bocang, published during the Guangxu reign). Although they are recent publications, they are extremely rare. Because they are first-hand material books, I collected them. Those who study marine products and southern flora and fauna should definitely read them, as many records are seen for the first time in these two books.
    Those who collect revolutionary documents often find extremely valuable books and materials in piles of tattered paper. Recently, the Beijing Tongwen Bookstore obtained the complete set of "Women's Daily." They are extremely happy. Mr. Liu, the owner of this bookstore, has a special interest in this type of literature. He has patiently and meticulously obtained many good things for the country from Sichuan, the two Hunan and Guangdong provinces, from places that no one pays attention to. It seems that our working comrades are not very good at such in-depth exploration, not afraid of spending time and effort to visit and seek. Sending books to the door, sometimes they still嫌嫌 it's too much trouble, put on a "master's air," yelling and scolding, and arbitrarily label them with the hat of "profiteering," how can they not make their enthusiasm for visiting books disappear like pouring a basin of cold water on hot coals! The so-called "visiting books" should be done carefully, patiently, and with urgent pursuit. As a cadre responsible for library acquisitions, a person responsible for the state's collection of literature, you must never sit at home and wait for people to send books to your door. Such a master's attitude must not be displayed. That is a complete manifestation of bureaucracy! As for those who still嫌嫌 it's too much trouble when books are sent to their door, then such people are not qualified to engage in work in this department.
    I myself am very confused: why, when I went to Suzhou last winter, did I discover that there were three places in Suzhou selling old books to waste paper collectors by the dan and jin, one of which was in the city? Why, when I went to Hangzhou this spring, did I also discover the same event happening? How could this be a mere "coincidence"! Before I arrived, or after I left, it is conceivable that this type of event is happening constantly and continuously. A cultural relics cadre in Suzhou asked me: "Are books like the 'Gentry Records' also useful?" I said, "Extremely useful! These books are a type of original historical material." He said, "A certain place has already weighed and discarded them as waste paper, several large piles of them." I asked, "Can they be recovered?" He shook his head. The old books in Weng's Alley in Changshu had already been sold to waste paper collectors. They rushed to search for them, but only recovered a small portion. The materials and archives of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and other imperialist aggressors from Wu Xu's house in Hangzhou had already been sold as waste paper. Fortunately, a bookstore in Hangzhou collected most of them. However, the seven or eight hundred jin of materials that were not collected by the bookstore had already been made into paper pulp and could not be recovered. This should have been a matter of "issuing commendations and awards," but instead, it was severely criticized. Comrades in some places usually sit back and do nothing, never taking action themselves, deaf to everything, blind to everything. When someone "discovers" something, they put on an "authoritative" face, raise the golden signboard of "preserving local literature," and prohibit exports. How can circulation within the borders of the People's Republic of China be called "export"? A certain province, knowing that people from Beijing bookstores had bought a lot of books, said: "Don't move, we want to buy them ourselves." Will they actually buy them? In fact, it is just "prohibiting exports," and they may not buy them themselves. But the enthusiasm of local old bookstores for collecting books is greatly affected. (End of this section)

    漫步书林
    谈访书
    西谛
    “天涯何处无芳草”，这句话对访书者说来，是最恰当不过的了。那里没有好书、奇书，有用、有益的书呢？只要有心去访求，一定可以找出不少好东西来的。我在广州图书馆里，就看到宋板的杨诚斋集，那是清末从日本流回广东的。向来杨诚斋集只见抄本，未见宋刻本，虽然这部书破烂得很，却是一个最晶莹的珍宝。广州图书馆从论担称斤的书堆里把它救出来了。如今是，物得其所，广东省把它送给北京图书馆，成为其中最好的宋板书之一。最近，北京隆福寺的文渊阁，从福建找到了不少抄本的好书，其中有一部章潢的“图书编”，是明抄的，有彩图。还没有仔细地和明刻本对读过，不知其异同如何。但可肯定的是，这抄本比刻本早，彩色插图，尤为重要。虽残阙十多册，北京图书馆亦收之。我也得到了三册“闽产录异”，二册“海错百一录”（均郭柏苍著，光绪间刻本），虽是近刊，却极不多见，以其是第一手的材料书，故收之。研究海产和南方的动植物者必当一读，有许多记载是第一次见之于这两部书里的。
    搜集革命文献的人更常常在破烂纸堆里找到极有价值的图书资料。也是最近，北京同文书店得到了全套的“妇女日报”。他们极为高兴。这家书店的主人刘君，对于这一门文献，特别有研究。他曾从四川，从两湖、两广，从没有人注意的地方，耐心地细致地为国家得到了很多好东西。像那些的深入探索，不怕费时费力地去访求，我们的工作同志们似乎是不大有其人的。把书送上门去，有时还嫌其多事，摆出“老爷架子”，呼叱指责，动不动便戴之以“暴利”的帽子，怎能不把他们的访书的积极性，弄得像把一盆冷水泼在热炭上似的烟消火灭了呢！所谓“访书”，是应该细心地耐心地急起直追地去访求的。作为一个为图书馆采访的干部，一个负责国家搜集文献的部门的人，绝对地不能坐在家里等人送书上门。那样的老爷架子千万摆不得。那是十足的官僚主义的表现！至于送上了门还要嫌其多事，那末，那样的人物是没有资格从事于这一部门工作的。
    我自己十分地困惑：为什么我去年冬天到了苏州，就会发现苏州那里有三个地方在论担称斤地把古书卖给了收废纸的人，其中一处就在城内？为什么我今年春天到了杭州，也就会发现同样的事件发生？这岂是“适逢其会”！在我未到之前，或在我离去之后，可以想像得到，这一类的事件是在不停地不断地发生着。苏州的文物干部问我：“难道绅缙录一类书也有用？”我说，“有用之至！这些书是原始史料的一种。”他说：“某处已经都称斤作废纸去了，足足有几大堆。”我问：“追得回来么？”他摇摇头。常熟翁家夹衖里的古书，已被卖给收废纸的了，急急地去追寻，只追回来一小部分。杭州吴煦家里的太平天国的和其他有关帝国主义者们侵略的资料和档案，已被卖作废纸了，亏得杭州某书店收了大部分下来。而未被某书店收下的七八百斤的资料，却已被造成纸浆，无法追回了。这是应该“传令嘉奖”的事，却反而大受批评一顿。有好些地方的同志们，平时高枕无为，自己绝不动手，耳无所闻，目无所见，等到有人“发现”了什么，便摆出“权威”面孔来，抬出“保存地方文献”的金字招牌，禁止出口。在中华人民共和国的国境之内流通，怎么会叫做“出口”？有某一个省，知道了北京的书店的人去买了不少书，就说：“不许动，我们自己要买的。”他们到底买不买呢？其实只是“禁止出口”而已，他们自己未必买。但当地古书店的收书的积极性，就受到很大的打击了。　（本节未完）
