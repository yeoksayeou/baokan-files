Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 12th – From September 10th to October 11th, over ten thousand tons of supplies have been transported from Baoji to Sichuan via the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. These supplies include cotton cloth, general merchandise, medicines, tires, and over a thousand tons of gasoline in specialized tank cars. The arrival of these supplies has partially restored the supply of over two thousand commodities in Sichuan Province, which were once out of stock due to strained transportation.

The overall transportation preparation work for the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is now basically able to meet the needs of traffic. While continuing to vigorously rectify problematic engineering, it can undertake the transportation of some urgently needed materials.

Recently, at a meeting on Baoji-Chengdu Railway transportation issues jointly held by the Baoji Unified Command Post of the Ministry of Railways and the Sichuan-Shaanxi Transportation Unified Command, it was decided that the Baoji-Chengdu Railway will continue to transport 40,000 tons of various goods in and out for various departments during October. Currently, there are direct freight trains running daily between Guangyuan and Fengxian, and between Fengxian and Baoji.

At present, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is transporting supplies for the Southwest and Northwest while not affecting the treatment of problematic engineering.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 12th – As of now, 334 problematic engineering projects on the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway have been completed. This is part of the line defects that have been discovered successively in the southern section from last year to the present. Another 238 problematic engineering projects will also be completed this year.

The 334 completed problematic engineering projects include all the open tunnels, arch tunnels, and most of the retaining walls in the Guangyuan-Lueyang section. They have all passed the quality inspection after trial operation.

Currently, along the line from Guangyuan to Huangsha River, the connecting point of the north and south sections, about 30,000 railway workers are busy building blind ditches and drainage ditches on both sides of the roadbed. They are installing sand slope protection on both sides of large and medium-sized bridges and along the roadbed adjacent to the Jialing River, which are easily eroded by mountain floods, to consolidate the bridge abutments and roadbed foundations, so that trains can pass smoothly in the future. At some tunnels heavily impacted by mountain floods, workers are excavating water diversion ditches on the mountain tops to allow floodwater to flow away from the top of the tunnels.

### 万吨物资经宝成铁路运到四川  宝成路南段部分病害工程整治完工

    万吨物资经宝成铁路运到四川
    宝成路南段部分病害工程整治完工
    新华社成都12日电　从9月10日到10月11日，已经有一万多吨物资由宝鸡方面经宝成铁路运到四川。这些物资包括棉布、百货、医药、轮胎和工业器材，另外还有用专用油槽车装载的上千吨汽油。这些物资运到以后，使四川省在物资运输紧张期间市场一度脱销的两千多种商品，部分恢复了供应。
    宝成铁路全线的运输准备工作，现在已经基本上能适应行车的需要。在继续大力整治病害工程的同时，它可以担负一部分急待运输的物资的运输了。
    最近，在铁道部宝鸡统一指挥所和川陕运输统一指挥部磋商宝成铁路运输问题的会议上，决定在10月份内，宝成铁路将继续为各有关部门运进运出各种货物四万吨。现在，从广元到凤县、从凤县到宝鸡，每天都有对开的直达货车。
    目前宝成铁路为西南和西北运输物资，都是在不影响整治病害工程的情况下进行的。
    新华社成都12日电　截至目前为止，宝成铁路南段的病害工程有三百三十四处整治完工。这是南段从去年到现在陆续发现的线路病害的一部分。还有二百三十八处病害工程，也将在今年内完成。
    这三百三十四处已经完工的病害工程，包括广（元）略（阳）段的全部明洞、蓬洞和大部分挡土墙等，经过行车检验，质量全部合格。
    目前，从广元到南北接轨点黄沙河的线路上，大约有三万铁路工人正忙着在路基两旁修筑盲沟、排水沟。他们在容易被山洪冲刷的大、中桥梁两岸和紧靠嘉陵江岸的路基旁，安砂护坡，巩固桥台和路基基础，便于列车将来能够平稳地通过。在某些受山洪冲击较大的隧道处，工人们正在山头开挖引水天沟，让洪水从隧道顶上流走。
