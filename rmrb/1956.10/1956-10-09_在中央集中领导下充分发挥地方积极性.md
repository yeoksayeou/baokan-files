　　In leading various revolutionary movements, the Party Central Committee has always adhered to the principle of combining a high degree of centralization with a high degree of democracy - in recent years, some central departments have restricted local authorities too much and too rigidly, which has undermined the development of local initiative - in the future, the central authorities should only put forward general guidelines, policies and broad plans for agriculture, small and medium-sized industries, local transportation, local commerce, primary and secondary education, etc., and the specific work should be handed over to local authorities for deployment and handling according to local conditions, time and circumstances. - We should also remember some of the parochialism and decentralization tendencies that occurred in some places in the past.

　　Since the Zunyi Conference twenty-one years ago, our Party Central Committee, based on the principle of democratic centralism, in accordance with the characteristics and specific conditions of each period, and following the leadership method of the mass line, has correctly handled the division of administrative management powers between the central and local authorities. In leading various revolutionary movements, the Party Central Committee has always adhered to the principle of combining a high degree of centralization with a high degree of democracy, the central unified guidelines, policies, and plans with the local adaptation to local conditions, time, and circumstances, thereby strengthening the centralized leadership of the central authorities and giving full play to the initiative of the local authorities, which is conducive to our solution of various complex revolutionary tasks. For example, in various democratic reform and socialist transformation movements, after the central authorities determined the guidelines and policies, they always let the local authorities take charge, formulate implementation plans based on local characteristics, determine the steps and methods of work, and handle matters according to local conditions. Even on the issue of guidelines and policies, the central authorities repeatedly consulted with the local authorities before making a decision, and in the implementation process, encouraged the local authorities to put forward opinions for revision and supplementation based on new experiences. This approach not only made the leadership of the central authorities more practical, but also strengthened the sense of responsibility of the local authorities and gave play to their creativity, ensuring the healthy development of the movement and the full mobilization of the masses. Of course, this is not to say that we have no shortcomings in this regard. On the contrary, in recent years, we have had many shortcomings and problems in this regard. The recent proposal and implementation by the central authorities to adjust the division of administrative management powers between the central and local authorities is to overcome these shortcomings in order to meet the needs of the work.

　　Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the Political Report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Eighth National Congress: In recent years, some central departments have taken too many things into their own hands, restricting local authorities too much and too rigidly, and ignoring the special circumstances and special conditions of local authorities. This is not conducive to local work, distracts the central authorities' energy, and develops bureaucracy. Why has this tendency occurred? I believe that this is because some of our comrades, including myself, sometimes easily forget our own historical experience, and in new situations, subjectivism, namely dogmatism and empiricism, easily revives and grows. This must arouse our profound vigilance.

　　The Party Central Committee pointed out that in agriculture, small and medium-sized industries, local transportation, local commerce, primary and secondary education, local health undertakings, and local finance, the central authorities should only put forward general guidelines, policies, and broad plans, and the specific work should be handed over to local authorities for deployment and handling according to local conditions, time, and circumstances. This is completely correct and necessary. In the past few years, such as land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and other democratic reforms, the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and many other tasks, have been carried out in accordance with the above-mentioned guidelines. Practice has proved that such a policy is most suitable for China's actual conditions, and is most capable of mobilizing all positive factors to accelerate China's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

　　In agriculture, China has a vast territory, a large population, and great differences between regions. Therefore, in formulating agricultural plans, there needs to be great flexibility to facilitate adapting to local conditions and giving full play to local and mass initiative. This is of great significance to China's agricultural production increase. In the past few years, the central departments concerned have basically conformed to the above-mentioned guidelines in leading agricultural production. However, there are also some problems in this regard. For example, this year the central departments concerned stipulated that Shandong should sow 30 million mu of soybeans. In order to develop high-yield crops, Shandong reduced the soybean sowing area to 25 million mu, but it can still complete the central government's assigned procurement task. This could have been allowed; but the central competent department insisted on completing the soybean sowing area plan. This made things very passive below. I think this approach is also not very appropriate.

　　China's local industrial potential is also very large. These small and medium-sized industries can not only provide a large number of products to meet the needs of the people, but also support the construction of large industries and accumulate a large amount of funds for the country. However, some of our comrades in the past did not understand this deeply. For example, many local industrial and mining enterprises can greatly increase output and quality with slight renovation and expansion, but they often do not receive active support from the central departments concerned in terms of investment, raw materials, and technology, and are even restricted by the central departments concerned. This is bound to hinder the exertion of local industrial potential. Since the central government proposed the policy of fully utilizing coastal industries and giving play to the potential of local industries this year, various localities have taken many measures, which will enable local industries to gain considerable development. For example, the investment in local industrial capital construction in Shanghai this year will increase by seven or eight times compared with last year, and the vast majority of construction units are using the original industrial base for renovation or expansion, so the investment is small, the speed is fast, and the results are great. This proves that the above-mentioned policy of the central government is beneficial to the upsurge of China's national economy and the improvement of people's lives.

　　Commercial work and the procurement of agricultural and sideline products are complex and the tasks are very heavy, and it can only be done better by relying on local forces. In the past few years, commercial work has achieved great results, which can be fully proved by the fact that prices are very stable. However, there are also situations where the central competent department manages too much, too meticulously, and too strictly. For example, purchase and sales plans, regardless of the nature of the product and the sales scope, adopt the "one-line whip" management method from top to bottom, and local authorities have no right to change or adjust them. Therefore, there are many blind spots in operation and management, there are unreasonable places in prices, and there is not enough consideration for the needs of the producing areas in procurement and supply; especially the "one-line whip" operation method causes too many intermediate links and excessive circulation costs, resulting in unreasonable purchase and sales price differences. This year, many places across the country have experienced pork shortages and a decline in the amount of pigs raised by farmers. The main reason is that there are too many intermediate links in pork operation, the cost is too high, and the purchase price of live pigs is too low. In some places in Jiangxi, it takes seventeen operations procedures from purchasing live pigs to selling pork, increasing circulation costs by more than 20% (excluding taxes). The circulation cost of Kunshan County Food Company in Jiangsu Province reaches 37%. In addition to the relevant personnel of the provincial, special, and county food companies, there are also purchasing stations, transfer stations, slaughterhouses, consignment stores, and one purchase and breeding staff member in each township in key producing areas for people who "eat by pigs." The Jiangsu Taixing County Food Company, purchasing stations, and purchase and breeding staff members total 427 people, exceeding the total quota of the county party committee and the county people's committee. If the local government makes overall arrangements according to local conditions, this unreasonable phenomenon could have been avoided.

　　In the past few years, China's cultural, educational, and health undertakings have been developed under the guidance and planning of the central unified guidelines and policies, mainly relying on the leadership of local party committees. The responsible cadres of the vast majority of schools are sent by the local party committees. The ideological and political work of these units is directly led by the local party committees. Facts have proved that if the central departments do not rely on local forces, it will be difficult for their work to be done well, and the undertakings they manage will suffer losses. We should not forget this experience.

　　The State Council recently convened a national system conference, which has studied and started to solve this problem. We believe that under the correct guidance of the Party Central Committee, these problems can be gradually solved.

　　Socialist construction needs to abide by the law of proportional development and needs national balance. Therefore, it is completely necessary for the Party Central Committee to require local leading organs to abide by the central government's guidelines and policies and national plans, take care of the overall situation, and give play to local initiative realistically and correctly to avoid any blindness or one-sidedness. In the past, some places have also experienced the tendency of blindly developing local industries, mutually restricting commodity circulation, and some parochialism and decentralization, which have caused us losses of varying degrees. We must also remember the lessons of the past in this regard.

　　Our Party has always adhered to the principle of democratic centralism. I believe that as long as we correctly combine strengthening the centralized leadership of the central authorities with giving full play to the initiative of the local authorities, we will do a better job in all aspects of our work.

### 在中央集中领导下充分发挥地方积极性

　　在中央集中领导下充分发挥地方积极性
　　谭震林
    党中央在领导各种革命运动中，都坚持了高度集中与高度民主相结合的原则——近几年来中央有些部门对地方限制得过多过死，有损地方积极性的发挥——今后对农业、小型和中型的工业、地方的交通运输事业、地方商业、中小学教育等等方面，中央只应当提出一般的方针政策和大体的规划，具体工作应当交由地方因地、因时、因事制宜地去部署办理。——也应该记取过去某些地方发生过的某些本位主义和分散主义的偏向。
    自遵义会议后二十一年以来，我党中央根据民主集中制的原则，依据各个时期的特点与具体条件，遵照群众路线的领导方法，正确地处理了中央和地方的行政管理职权的划分问题。党中央在领导各种革命运动中，都坚持了高度的集中与高度的民主相结合、中央统一的方针、政策、规划与地方的因地、因时、因事制宜相结合的原则，从而既加强了中央的集中领导，又充分发挥了地方的积极性，这就有利于我们解决各项复杂的革命任务。例如在各项民主改革和社会主义改造运动中，中央确定了方针、政策以后，总是放手让地方负责，由地方根据各地的特点制定实施方案，确定工作的步骤和方法，因地制宜地去办理。即使是方针、政策问题，在确定之前，中央也是反复和地方商量，并且在执行中，鼓励地方根据新的经验提出修正补充的意见。这种做法，不仅使中央的领导更加切合实际，而且使地方加强了责任心和发挥了创造性，保证了运动的健康发展和充分发动了群众。当然，这不是说在这方面我们就没有缺点了。相反，近几年来，我们在这方面是存在着不少缺点和问题的。最近中央提出并着手调整中央和地方行政管理职权的划分，就是为了克服这方面的缺点，以适应工作的需要的。
    刘少奇同志在中国共产党中央委员会向第八次全国代表大会的政治报告中指出：近几年来，中央有些部门把过多的事情抓到自己手里，对地方限制得过多过死，忽视地方的特殊情况和特殊条件。这样，既不利于地方工作，也分散了中央的精力，发展了官僚主义。为什么会发生这种偏向呢？我认为，这是因为我们有些同志，包括我自己在内，有时容易忘记我们自己的历史经验，在新的情况下，容易复活和滋长主观主义，即教条主义和经验主义。这必须引起我们深刻的警惕。
    党中央指出：在农业、小型和中型的工业、地方的交通运输事业、地方商业、中小学教育、地方卫生事业和地方财政等等方面，中央只应当提出一般的方针政策和大体的规划，具体工作应当交由地方因地、因时、因事制宜地去部署办理。这是完全正确和必要的。在过去几年中，例如土地改革、镇压反革命分子和其他各项民主改革，对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，以及其他许多工作，都是按照上述方针进行的。实践证明：这样的方针，是最适合于我国的实际情况的，是最能调动一切积极因素，以加速我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的。
    在农业方面，我国幅员广大，人口众多，各地的差别性又很大，因此，在制定农业计划时，需要有很大的灵活性，以利于因地制宜，充分发挥地方的积极性和群众的积极性。这一点对于我国的农业增产，具有重大的意义。过去几年来，中央有关部门在领导农业生产中，基本上是符合上述方针的。但是在这方面也有一些毛病。例如今年中央有关部门规定山东播种大豆面积三千万亩。山东为了发展高产作物，将大豆的播种面积减为二千五百万亩，可是，仍可以完成中央分配的收购任务。这本来是可以允许的；但中央主管部门坚持要完成大豆播种面积的计划。这样，使得下面很被动。我认为这种作法也是不很妥当的。
    我国地方工业的潜在力量，也是很大的。这些中小型工业，不仅可以提供大量产品来满足人民的需要，而且可以支援大工业的建设，替国家积累大量资金。但是我们有的同志过去对这方面也是领会不深的。如许多地方工矿企业稍加改建扩建，就可以大大提高产量和质量，但往往在投资、原料及技术等等方面，得不到中央有关部门的积极支持，甚至受到中央有关部门的限制。这就势必妨碍地方工业潜力的发挥。自中央今年提出充分利用沿海工业与发挥地方工业的潜力的方针以后，各地都采取了很多的措施，这将使地方工业获得不少的发展。例如上海市今年的地方工业基本建设投资额将比去年增加七、八倍，绝大部分的建设单位是利用原有工业基础进行改建或扩建的，因而投资少、速度快、收效大。这就证明，中央的上述方针，对我国国民经济的高涨和人民生活的改善，都是有利的。
    商业工作与农、副业产品采购工作方面，情况复杂，任务也很繁重，也只有依靠地方的力量，才能办得更好。过去几年中商业工作成绩是很大的，这从物价非常稳定这个事实，就可以得到充分的证明。但是，也存在着中央主管部门管得过多、过细、过严的情况。如购销计划，不问产品性质和销售范围，都采用由上而下“一条鞭”管到底的经营方法，地方无权变动调整，因而经营管理上发生了不少的盲目性，价格有不合理的地方，收购和供应中照顾产地需要也不够；特别是“一条鞭”的经营方式，使中间环节过多，流转费用过大，以致购销差价不合理。今年全国不少地方都发生过猪肉脱销，农民养猪量下降的情况，主要原因就是因为经营猪肉的中间环节过多，成本过大，生猪的收购价格过低。江西有的地方从购进生猪到出卖猪肉，要经过十七道运转手续，增加20％以上的流转费用（还不算税收）。江苏昆山县食品公司的流转费用达37％。“靠猪吃饭”的人，除省、专、县食品公司的有关人员外，还有收购站、转运站、屠宰场、代销店、重点产区每乡还有一个派购派养员。江苏泰兴县食品公司、收购站和派购派养员三项即达四百二十七人，超过了该县县委和县人民委员会编制的总名额。假若由地方根据当地情况统筹安排，这种不合理的现象，本来是可以避免的。
    我国的文化、教育、卫生事业，过去几年来，在中央统一的方针、政策的指导与规划下，主要地是依靠地方党委的领导而发展起来的。绝大多数学校的负责干部，都是由地方党委派去的。这些单位的思想政治工作，都是由地方党委直接领导的。事实证明：中央各部门，如果不依靠地方的力量，它的工作就很难作好，它所管理的事业，就会遭受损失。这一条经验，我们不应该忘记。
    最近国务院召开了全国体制会议，已经研究和着手解决这一方面的问题，我们相信在党中央的正确方针下，这些问题是能够逐步解决的。
    社会主义建设工作需要遵守按比例发展的规律，需要全国的平衡。因此，党中央要求地方领导机关，遵守中央的方针政策与国家计划，照顾全局，实事求是地、正确地发挥地方的积极性，以避免任何的盲目性、片面性，这也是完全必要的。过去某些地方也曾发生过盲目发展地方工业，互相限制商品流通，以及某些本位主义、分散主义的偏向，给我们造成过或大或小的损失。在这方面我们也要记取过去的教训。
    我们党是始终坚持民主集中制原则的。我相信，只要正确地把加强中央的集中领导与充分发挥地方的积极性结合起来，我们就会把各项工作做得更好一些。
