Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 28th. More than twenty friends of Sun Yat-sen during his lifetime and old Tongmenghui members gathered in Shanghai on the 27th to discuss Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary achievements and patriotic thought.

Zhang Jiuwei, with his white hair, followed Sun Yat-sen in London to carry out revolutionary work. He said: When Sun Yat-sen announced the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers in 1924, he was opposed by Liu Chengyu and others within the Kuomintang. However, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's attitude was very firm, and he had fierce arguments with them. Mr. Sun Yat-sen finally won the support of the majority and finally announced this glorious and great policy.

Zhou Nangai, who served as the commander of the Wusongkou Fort in Shanghai in 1913, also narrated a story of Sun Yat-sen's love for the country and the people. At that time, Yuan Shikai's forces to seize political power were becoming more and more rampant, and Zhou Nangai could no longer defend the Wusongkou Fort. They wanted to lead the army into the Shanghai Concession before retreating, and at the same time carry out destruction in the Yangtze River Delta. They believed that rushing into the concession could strain Yuan Shikai's relationship with British and French imperialism, and destroying the cities and villages in the Yangtze River Delta would be an economic blow to Yuan Shikai. At that time, Sun Yat-sen was in Shanghai and firmly opposed the plans of Zhou Nangai and others. Mr. Sun believed that the destruction caused by these troops would have little impact on Yuan Shikai, but would cause disaster to the local people, and the people would definitely resent the Kuomintang, and even not support the Kuomintang in the future. Mr. Sun advocated going to Japan temporarily. He said that Yuan Shikai would definitely fail in the future.

The elderly people who attended the meeting also talked about Sun Yat-sen's simple life, amiable attitude, and examples of caring for young people. Many people felt particularly excited that the goals that Sun Yat-sen wanted to achieve in his forty years of revolution have been realized today.

This symposium was convened by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.

    在上海的孙中山生前友好和老同盟会会员
    座谈孙中山先生的革命业迹
    新华社上海28日电　二十多个孙中山先生生前友好和老同盟会会员27日在上海集会，座谈有关孙中山先生的革命业迹和爱国主义思想。
    白发苍苍的张九维，在伦敦就追随孙中山先生进行革命工作。他说：1924年孙中山宣布联俄联共扶助农工三大政策时，曾遭到国民党内部刘成禺等人的反对，但是孙中山先生的态度非常坚决，同他们进行了激烈的争论。孙中山先生最后取得多数的拥护，终于宣布了这一个光辉的伟大政策。
    1913年担任上海吴淞口炮台指挥官的周南陔，他也叙述了一段孙中山先生爱国爱民的故事。当时袁世凯侵夺政权的势力越来越猖狂，周南陔在吴淞口炮台已经守不住了。他们想在撤退以前率领军队冲进上海租界，同时到长江三角洲一带进行破坏。他们认为，冲进租界可以使袁世凯同英、法帝国主义关系紧张，破坏长江三角洲的城市和乡村就是给袁世凯经济上的打击。那时孙中山先生正在上海，对周南陔等人的计划坚决反对。孙先生认为这一些军队所作的破坏对袁世凯说来影响不大，但却会使当地人民遭受祸殃，人民一定会因此怨恨国民党，甚至以后不支持国民党。孙先生主张暂时到日本去。他说，袁世凯以后一定会失败的。
    到会的老人们还谈到了孙中山先生生活朴素，和蔼可亲的态度和爱护青年的事例。许多人对孙中山先生四十年革命所要达到的目的在今天已经实现，感到特别兴奋。
    这次座谈会是中国国民党革命委员会上海市委员会召集的。
