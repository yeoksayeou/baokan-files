Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 27th: The construction of the Palace of Sports within the grounds of the Moscow Central Lenin Stadium is nearing completion. It will be the largest indoor stadium in Europe. The building is 150 meters long and 90 meters wide, with the competition area occupying over 1,800 square meters. The auxiliary facilities of the stadium alone are as large as ten Moscow Grand Theaters.

The roof of the Palace of Sports is as high as a seven-story building. The semi-circular auditorium has 27 tiers with a total of 14,700 seats. If additional seating is required for boxing or wrestling matches, it can accommodate 17,400 people.

This competition venue can easily be transformed from an artificial ice skating rink into a clay court for tennis, a wooden court for basketball and volleyball, or a venue for boxing and gymnastics. The stadium also has a large-scale ventilation system that can regulate the required temperature and humidity throughout the year.

Many international competitions between Soviet and foreign athletes will be held here successively. In early November, the Soviet ice hockey championship will be held in the stadium; in February next year, the world and European ice hockey championships will open here.

    全欧洲最大的室内体育场
    莫斯科运动员之宫将落成
    新华社莫斯科27日电在莫斯科中央列宁运动场的领域内，运动员之宫的建筑工程即将完成。它将是全欧洲最大的室内体育场。这个建筑物长达一百五十公尺，宽九十公尺，其中比赛场占一千八百平方公尺以上，单是体育馆的附属设备就有十个莫斯科大剧院那样大。
    运动员之宫的顶盖有七层楼房那样高。半圆形观众席有二十七级，共有一万四千七百个席位，在举行拳击或者摔跤等比赛时要增设加座的话，那就可以容纳一万七千四百人。
    这种比赛场可以很容易地从人造冰的溜冰场变成打网球用的土场、打篮排球用的木板场，或是用来作拳击和体操的场地。这个体育馆还有大规模的通风装置，可以在一年四季中调节所需要的温度和湿度。
    苏联运动员同外国运动员之间的许多国际比赛都将陆续在这里举行。11月初，体育馆里就要举行苏联曲棍球冠军赛；明年2月，世界和欧洲的曲棍球冠军赛将在这里开幕。
