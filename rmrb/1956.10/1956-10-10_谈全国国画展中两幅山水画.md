　　On Two Landscape Paintings in the National Chinese Painting Exhibition

    Mr. Liu Haisu's painting "Rainy Mist on Yanling Shoals of the Fuchun River" is one of the outstanding works in this exhibition. This painting is about three feet wide and two feet high, painted on raw Xuan paper in one go. There is a mountain in the near distance, a layer of near slope, and several layers of distant mountains behind the slope. Its important part is a stretch of shoal water and two wooden boats on the water. This painting is not large in size and has few embellishments, but the expression is very prominent. People are attracted to the beautiful scenery of the shoal at a glance, and they feel relaxed and happy. Therefore, most of the audience likes this painting. I studied it carefully, and the near mountains are close to the painting methods of Ma Yuan and Xia Gui, and the distant mountains are close to the painting methods of Li Cheng. The author's skills are proficient, and he can melt the brush and ink techniques of the ancients, and prominently depict the great nature of the motherland. A few small pine trees on the near mountain, and some miscellaneous trees are dotted with light ink behind the pine trees, which makes the atmosphere feel deep and thick, and it can be understood that his conception in creation is very meticulous. The figures on the boat are concise and vivid. From the look of the boatman, it can be explained that the boat is traveling in the rapid current of the shoal, showing that the author's sketching is very grounded. The most wonderful thing in the painting is a piece of shoal water. This piece of shoal water occupies most of the picture. There are a few small stones painted with thick ink in the nearest place, and the spray of the rapid current is also painted with thick ink next to the small stones. In addition, light ink is used to paint the misty atmosphere of rain and fog, and the hook water method of painting Pingquan is used to express the shoal water, which completely captures the dynamics of the rapid current of the shoal. In the spring of this year, I went to Guilin to sketch, and took a wooden boat on the Li River for several days. I saw dozens of rapid currents on the shoals, and I realized the dynamic state of the shoal water flow. Therefore, when I saw Mr. Haisu's painting of the shoal water, I admired his exquisite handling very much. Guo Ruoxu of the Song Dynasty said in "Picture Seeing and Hearing Records": "From the beginning to the end, the pen has greetings, continuous and related, the breath is constant, so the intention exists before the pen, the pen is within the intention, the painting is exhausted and the intention is in, and the image should be completely divine." This piece of shoal water is in line with the spirit of the ancients' use of pen, and can paint the sound of the shoal.
    As for his expression of rain and fog, he only uses light ink dense spots, and each stroke shows strength. Once rendered, the atmosphere becomes more magnificent and real. Leaving a horizontal white cloud under the distant mountain makes it feel more implicit and endless. It is really a misty scene of rapid currents on the shoal in rain and fog.
    Furthermore, this painting does not dye the sky, and the whole picture is not colored. Some people say that only by using heavy colors can the real scenery be expressed. This is not entirely true. In fact, the ink and wash function of Chinese painting has infinite changes. The ancients said that ink is divided into five colors, which is correct. However, it is difficult for people who learn to paint to master ink and wash paintings. High-level painters are good at coloring paintings, and uncolored paintings will show the high skill of using ink more. I think this painting contains the four advantages of "both vigor and strength, old-fashioned style, reasonable variation, and natural coming and going" mentioned by the ancients.
    Mr. Haisu has the foundation of Chinese painting, and in middle age, he devoted himself to the study of Western painting to absorb the strengths of Western painting. Recently, he has worked harder to engage in the creation of Chinese painting. He has studied the heritage of national painting very carefully, and used traditional techniques to create realistic works, so he has achieved today's achievements.
    Mr. Wu Hufan is an excellent landscape painter. His skills are superb, his style is elegant and beautiful, which is known in the Chinese painting circle, and I don't need to praise him again. In order to introduce Chinese painting techniques to people who study Chinese painting, I will analyze and study his landscape painting "Cloud Top". Since the subject of this painting is the top of a cloud mountain, the top of the mountain should be painted magnificently and splendidly, and the state of the clouds and mist should be faintly visible, so as to show that the top of the mountain is in the clouds. The white clouds in the painting are scattered, from the top to the bottom of the paper, painting the changes of the clouds, especially the nine-fold spring water that meanders downwards, converges into a waterfall, and rushes into the clouds. In this way, the depiction of the spring water is flexible, it breaks open the rocks, and the rocks are more jagged. Using clouds to express the deep distance, and using spring water to express the high distance, these are all techniques left by the ancients, which are the most able to express the most beautiful composition methods.
    Looking at the trees under the mountain, the two ancient pine trees are straight and bent, which is very varied. Behind the pine trees, trees are actually painted with large mixed dots. Only painters with extremely high skills dare to paint like this. Next to the large mixed dot trees, two crab claw-style frost trees and clumps of small trees are painted with thick ink, which are also handled very naturally, and the artistic conception is very similar to the taste of Shen Qinan and Wen Zhengming. Painting trees occupies the most important position in landscape painting. It looks easy, but it is actually very difficult. I have seen two painters' paintings of the top of Mount Tai and Tongjun Mountain in the Fuchun River, etc., in which the trees are very naive. If the painter's foundation is not deep, the pen will immediately reveal improper use of the pen when it falls on the paper. I hope that people who love Chinese painting should not only focus on the superficial, but must pay attention to the fundamental skills. Furthermore, the uppermost layer of this painting is the top of the mountain. The expression of the rocks does not use many strokes, and they are scattered naturally. Use a slightly thicker ink to lift one or two strokes in the gouache, which can show a refreshing spirit. The small trees on the top of the mountain use round dots, and the small trees on the next part use horizontal dots, which can all melt the painting methods of Dong Yuan and Ju Ran. As for the rendering of the immersion and implicit, it can be regarded as the best skill in painting landscapes. If you are not good at using raw paper to render, you will never be able to express it so magnificently. This painting is an outstanding one in the landscape paintings exhibited.
    Landscape paintings account for 40% of the works in this National Chinese Painting Exhibition, but there are not many that can use brush and ink just right. I hope that general landscape painters will learn the traditional techniques of the ancients, and at the same time travel thousands of miles. Through the sketching process, they will carry out artistic processing, and then they will create works with high artistry. Mr. Hufan has made great achievements in describing nature. If he can experience life more deeply, he will not only create more outstanding works for the motherland, but also create more superb techniques.

　　谈全国国画展中两幅山水画
　　胡佩衡
    刘海粟先生画的“富春江严陵濑雨雾”，在这次画展中，是出色的作品之一。这张画横约三尺，高约二尺，用生宣纸一气写成。近山一座，近坡一层，坡后有几层远山，它重要的部分，就是一片滩水和水上木船两只。这张画幅面不大，点缀不多，但是表现非常的突出，使看的人一望就被画中的滩头丽景吸引住，感觉到心旷神怡，因而观众大都喜爱这张画。我细细研究它，近山近于马远、夏珪的画法，远山近于李成的画法。作者的技法熟练，能融化古人的笔墨技法，突出地描写祖国大自然。近山上几棵小松树，松树后边又用淡墨点些杂树，便觉气象深厚，可以了解他在创作上的构思是很细密的。船上的人物简练得神，从船夫的神态上，可以说明船正行在滩头激流中，表现出作者素描很有根底。画中最妙的就是一片滩水，这片滩水占全画面的绝大部分，最近处有几块用浓墨画成的小石，小石的旁边也用浓墨画激流的水花，此外用淡墨画雨雾迷蒙的气氛，借用一般画平泉的钩水法来表现滩水，完全抓住了滩水激流的动态。我在今年春天，到桂林写生，在漓江坐木船走了好几天，看到了几十处滩水激流，体会了滩水流动的神态，所以一看海粟先生画的滩水，我很钦佩他处理的精妙。宋郭若虚“图画见闻志”说：“自始及终，笔有朝揖，连绵相属，气脉不断，所以意存笔先，笔周意内，画尽意在，像应神全”。这一片滩水，正符合古人用笔的精神，能把滩声画出来了。
    至于他表达雨雾，仅用淡墨密点，笔笔见出力量，一经渲染，气氛愈显得雄厚真实，远山下部留出白云一横，更觉含蓄不尽，真是雨雾中滩头激流迷蒙的景色。
    再者，这张画并未染天，并且全幅不着颜色。有人说，只有用重颜色，才能表达真实景物。这是不尽然的，实际上国画的水墨作用，变化无穷，古人说墨分五色，是不错的。不过学画的人，作水墨画是很难掌握的，程度高的画家，着色画是好的，不着色的画会更显出用墨的高妙。我认为这张画含有古人所说的“气韵兼力、格制俱老、变异合理、去来自然”四大优点。
    海粟先生既有国画的根底，中年又力研西画，以吸取西画的长处，近来更努力从事国画的创作，对于民族绘画的遗产，很用心研究，用传统的技法，来创作现实主义的作品，才有今天的成就。
    吴湖帆先生是一位优秀的山水画家。他的技法高妙，气韵雅秀，是国画界都知道的，用不着我再来称赞。为了给学习国画的人介绍国画技巧，所以我把他的“云中山顶”一幅山水画，进行分析研究。这张画的题材既是云中山顶，山顶要画出雄奇壮丽，尤要写出表现云雾的若隐若现的神态，方能表示出山顶是在云中。画中白云错落，从上端一直到纸底，画尽了云的变化，尤妙在九叠泉水曲折地下泄，汇集成瀑布，奔入云中。这样一来泉水的描绘是灵活的，它把山石破开，山石更显得参差有致。既用云表示深远，又用泉水表出高远，这都是古人遗留下的技巧，也就是最能表现的最美的构图方法。
    再看山下的树，两棵古松一直一偃，处理得很有变化，在松树后边居然用大混点画树，非程度极高的画家不敢这样画。在大混点树旁又用浓墨画两棵蟹爪式霜树和丛生的小树，处理得也非常自然，意境很像沈启南、文徵明的趣味。画树在山水画里占最重要的地位，看着很容易，实际很困难，曾见有两位画家所画的泰山绝顶和富春江的桐君山等画幅，里面画的树十分幼稚，画家的根底如果不深，笔一落在纸上，立刻就显露出用笔不妥当。我希望一般热爱国画的人，不可仅在皮毛上着眼，必须注重根本技法上的功夫。再者，这张画最上层就是山顶，山石的表现，用笔不多，错落自然。在勾皴里用较浓的墨提一两笔，就能显出精神清爽。山顶上一部分的小树用圆点，再下一部分的小树用横点，这都是能融化董、巨的画法。至于渲染的淹润含蓄，更算是极尽画山水的能事了，要不是善于用生纸渲染，决不能表现得如此雄浑。这幅画，在展出的山水画中是出色的一幅。
    这届国画展的山水画，占出品40％，但用笔用墨能恰到好处的实在不多。我希望一般的山水画家，学习古人的传统技巧，同时要行万里路，由写生过程，再进行艺术加工，然后才会创作出艺术性高的作品。湖帆先生描写大自然，有很大的成就，若再能更深刻地多多体验生活，不但必然会为祖国创作出更多出色的作品，同时也必能创造出更多高妙的技法来。
