    九龙昨日没有发生骚乱
    新华社广州15日电　香港今日下午十时消息：九龙今日没有发生骚乱事件。据香港英国当局今晚八时宣布，目前的戒严令明日期满后将不打算再戒严。官方宣布，荃湾的英国军队最后一批已撤出，“正常的警察巡逻已经恢复”。
    但是，九龙的深水埗今晚六时到明晨七时仍实行戒严。荃湾一带从今晨十时起继续戒严二十四小时。原定今天的足球赛、马赛已停止举行。
    据“华侨日报”今日报道，昨晚香港方面有些地点情况紧张，深夜十一时四十分，西营盘警署曾出动警员二百多人到鸭脷洲进行了搜查。
    前曾传说荃湾南海纱厂曾在昨晚十时遭受暴徒袭击。今日香港“大公报”、“文汇报”的记者由两个警察陪同前往荃湾采访。当记者就传闻14日晚暴徒袭击南海纱厂一事询问该厂一位高级职员时，这位高级职员说：昨晚十时左右，英国警察在荃湾街上拘捕了五百多人，把他们拘禁在南海纱厂的宿舍里。被拘捕在那里的人曾一度鼓噪起来，附近的英军即鸣枪告警。他说，昨晚并未发生暴徒袭击该纱厂的事件。
