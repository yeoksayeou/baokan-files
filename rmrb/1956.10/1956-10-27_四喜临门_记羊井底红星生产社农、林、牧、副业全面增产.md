    "Four Joys Arrive at the Door"
    A Record of the All-Round Production Increase in Agriculture, Forestry, Animal Husbandry, and Sideline Occupations in the Hongxing Production Cooperative of Yangjingdi
    Fan Yongming, Guo Jianzhong
    The nationally famous Hongxing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative of Yangjingdi Township, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, has fully demonstrated the superiority of advanced cooperatives. This year, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations have all achieved comprehensive production increases, with income increasing by 41.2% compared to last year, and 95.6% of cooperative members having increased their income compared to last year. The cooperative members excitedly said: This is truly "four joys arriving at the door."
    Agriculture – Exceeding the 1957 Planned Output
    After this cooperative transitioned to an advanced cooperative in January of this year, in addition to continuing to implement the previous years' cultivation techniques, such as superior seeds, close planting, deep plowing to preserve moisture, increased fertilizer application, soil and water conservation, and meticulous cultivation, they also launched a rationalization proposal campaign to explore production increase potential. Through everyone using their brains and thinking of solutions, they discovered three new production increase measures that were not possible or available in the elementary cooperative: first, cutting and filling land to improve the soil; in the past, many plots of land in this cooperative were uneven and of low quality; second, all land was uniformly treated with increased fertilizer application; and third, the implementation of rational intercropping. The cooperative planned the more than 800 mu of land that needed to be cut and filled, and proposed the slogan of "two leveling" (filling and leveling, harrowing) and "four don'ts" (no hard clods of soil, no red clay, no stones, no sharp grass roots), using 3,200 workdays to cut and fill 580 mu of land, connecting eighty small plots into fifty large plots. After the small plots were merged into large plots, more than 200 workdays were saved in cultivation, and 11 mu of cultivated land were also expanded. After the autumn survey of seedlings to determine production, each mu increased production by more than 40 jin compared to land that was not cut and filled, and the expansion of cultivated land alone increased production by 25,000 jin of grain.
    Regarding fertilizer application, the average number of dan applied per mu was not small before last year, but it was very uneven. For example, last year the average fertilizer application per mu was 85 dan, with some reaching 200 dan, and others less than 30 dan. Therefore, the crops grew differently. Land near the village produced more than 700 jin per mu, while land further away produced less than 200 jin. This year, the entire cooperative applied an average of 120 dan of fertilizer per mu, an increase of 35 dan compared to last year. This year, despite suffering from severe flooding, the yield per mu was more than 400 jin, an increase of more than 100 jin compared to last year.
    Rational intercropping was also a new production increase measure this year. Previously, due to a lack of labor, intercropping was not practiced in crop planting for fear of delaying work. This year, the cooperative responded to the four production increase measures of intercropping, interplanting, replanting, and planting along the edges of fields proposed by the Pingshun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, increasing production by more than 30 jin per mu, for a total increase of 30,000 jin of grain. However, this year, due to the worst flood in decades, 289 mu of wheat, 287 mu of potatoes, and more than 150 mu of low-lying land were damaged by flooding. Although flood fighting and drainage efforts were carried out, these lands still suffered reduced yields.
    Due to the widespread implementation of past cultivation techniques and the addition of three new production increase measures, in addition to making up for the losses from reduced production, this year, on 1,515.5 mu of grain crops, the average yield per mu reached 416 jin, an increase of 33 jin compared to last year's average yield of 383 jin, exceeding the 6.4% of the planned output for the First Five-Year Plan – 1957, with the total output reaching 630,333 jin. At the same time, new records of high yields were achieved: 92 mu of corn yielding 1,000 jin per mu and 25 mu of millet yielding 700 jin per mu.
    Forestry – Changing the "Alternate Year Rest" Phenomenon of Fruit Trees
    The Hongxing Cooperative operates more than 340 mu of orchards, with more than 70 mu currently bearing fruit and generating income, and the remaining 270 mu being newly cultivated since the organization. Looking at the 70 mu currently bearing fruit, the income accounts for 23% of agricultural income. Therefore, the cooperative members call the orchards: "The lifeline of the farmers of Yangjingdi."
    Yangjingdi has been operating orchards for 80 years, and the biggest problem it has brought to farmers is "alternate year rest." The cooperative members' conclusion about the orchard is: "One year of joy, one year of worry, no way to harvest every year." This year is precisely a year when fruit trees rest. However, thanks to learning from the experience of the Liaoning Province study delegation in solving the "alternate year rest" of fruit trees, the fruit trees that were pruned this year are universally laden with red fruit, and the cooperative harvested 100,000 jin of pears and apples, earning 9,050 yuan, accounting for 12.3% of the total income, exceeding seventeen times the income in 1954, a similar year of rest.
    Animal Husbandry – Breaking Historical Records
    The development of animal husbandry in the Hongxing Cooperative this year has exceeded any previous year. The flock of sheep increased from 414 last year to 509, and 120 ewes gave birth to 147 lambs. Due to the good management of the sheep flock, all 146 lambs survived, except for one that died due to a physiological defect, and the breeding rate exceeded the original plan by 17.8%. There are 116 head of large livestock, among which all 27 breeding females were bred. This year, three mule foals, one horse foal, and one donkey foal have been produced. The number of pigs increased from 39 last year to 115. Seven large sows farrowed seven litters, breeding 55 piglets, guaranteeing that each household will have one pig by the spring of 1957. The total value of animal husbandry income this year reached 3,039 yuan, an increase of 25.3% compared to 1955. The main reason for the increase in animal husbandry production is the implementation of the quota management and over-quota reward system, which greatly stimulated the production enthusiasm of cattle and sheep workers and breeders.
    Sideline Occupations – Increasing Income by 27% Compared to Last Year
    After the Hongxing Cooperative achieved advanced collectivization, it extracted 58 laborers based on the characteristics of mountain production and widely carried out a variety of sideline production activities. This year, the cooperative operated more than 100 types of sideline production, an increase of 37 types compared to 1955, including digging medicinal herbs. Sideline income was 15,666 yuan, an increase of 27% compared to last year.
    The Hongxing Cooperative, under the superior conditions of advanced collectivization, adhered to the policy of comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations. After a year of efforts, comprehensive production increases have been achieved. The total collective income of the cooperative this year is equivalent to 73,428 yuan, an increase of 41.2% compared to last year. Adding the 21,430 yuan of individual sideline production income of the cooperative members, the total annual income is 94,858 yuan, of which the income from diversified economy reached 60,969 yuan, accounting for 64% of the total income. After formulating the income distribution plan, based on the principle of deducting less and distributing more, 67% of the total income can be distributed to the cooperative members. Together with the personal income of the cooperative members, the average net income per household for all 206 households in the cooperative is 342 yuan and 8 jiao. Calculated according to the current 958 people, the average per person is 73 yuan and 7 jiao, equivalent to 1,230 jin of grain. Judging from grain income alone, after paying public grain, selling surplus grain, and deducting seeds and feed, each person can receive 522 jin of ration grain, an increase of 72 jin compared to last year. Except for nine households in the entire cooperative whose income was slightly reduced compared to last year due to less labor and illness, the remaining 95.6% of the cooperative members' households all increased their income compared to last year. Due to the large income this year, the cooperative had already pre-distributed eight times to the cooperative members before August. Cooperative member Liu Maosong happily said: "Advanced collectivization has only been one year, and we already have such a large income. I really didn't expect it!"

    “四喜临门”
    记羊井底红星生产社农、林、牧、副业全面增产
    范永明　郭建中
    全国著名的山西省平顺县羊井底乡红星农、林、牧生产合作社，充分显示了高级合作社的优越性。今年农、林、牧、副业获得全面增产，收入比去年增加41.2％，有95.6％的社员比去年增加了收入。社员们兴奋地说：这真是“四喜临门”。
    农业—超过1957年计划产量
    这个社在今年1月转为高级社后，除继续贯彻执行往年的优种、密植、深耕保墒、增加肥料，保持水土、精耕细作等耕作技术外，还开展了发掘增产潜力的合理化建议运动。经过人人动脑筋、个个想办法，发掘了在初级社时所没有也不可能办到的三条新的增产措施：一是切垫土地，改良土壤：往年，这个社有好多土地高低不平，质量很低；二是所有的土地，一律增施肥料；三是实行了合理间作。社里把需要切垫加高的八百多亩土地进行了规划，提出了“两平”（垫平、耙平）“四不要”（硬土块不要，红粘土不要，带石头子不要，有尖草根不要）的口号，用工三千二百个，切垫了五百八十亩土地，把八十块小块地连成了五十块大块地。小块地并大块以后，在耕作上省工二百多个，还扩大了十一亩耕地。经过秋季查苗定产，每亩比不切垫的增产四十多斤，连扩大耕地这一项就增产了两万五千斤粮食。
    在施肥上，去年以前每亩平均担数也不少，但很不平衡。如去年每亩平均上肥八十五担，最多的有二百担，还有不到三十担的。因此，庄稼长的也不一样，近地有亩产七百斤以上的，远地还有产不到二百斤的。今年全社每亩施肥平均一百二十担，比去年增加三十五担。今年受了严重涝灾，每亩产量都在四百斤以上，比去年增产一百多斤。
    合理间作，也是今年一项新的增产措施。以前，因劳力赶不来，怕误工，在种植作物上就不实行间作。今年，社里响应了中共平顺县委套种、间作、复播、种边岸的四项增产措施，每亩增产三十多斤，共增产三万斤粮食。但是，今年因为遭到了数十年来未有的大涝灾，使二百八十九亩小麦，二百八十七亩山药蛋和一百五十多亩沟洼地被水淹坏了，虽经抗洪排涝斗争，这些地还是减产了。
    由于普遍地贯彻执行了已往的耕作技术和增加了三项新的增产措施，除弥补了减产损失外，今年在一千五百一十五亩五分粮食作物的土地上，每亩平均产到四百一十六斤，比去年每亩平均产量三百八十三斤增产三十三斤，超过第一个五年计划——1957年计划产量的6.4％，总产量达到六十三万零三百三十三斤。同时，还出现了九十二亩玉米千斤亩和二十五亩亩产七百斤谷子的高额丰产新纪录。
    林业—改变了果木树“隔年歇”的现象
    红星社经营着三百四十多亩果木园，现有七十多亩挂货有收入，其余的二百七十多亩是组织起来以后新培育起来的。就以目前挂货的七十多亩来看，收入要占到农业收入的23％。因此，社员们把果木园称为：“羊井底农民的命根子”。
    羊井底经营果木已有八十年的历史，它给农民带来的一个最大苦恼是“隔年歇”。社员们对果园的结论是：“一年喜，一年忧，啥办法也不能年年收”。今年正是果木歇枝的一年。但由于学习了辽宁省参观团介绍的解决果木树“隔年歇”的经验，今年修理过的果树普遍挂满了红，全社收入梨果十万斤，收入九千零五十元，占总收入的12.3％，超过1954年同样歇枝年收入的十七倍。
    牧业—打破了历史纪录
    红星社今年畜牧业的发展超过以往任何一年。羊群由去年的四百一十四只增加到五百零九只，一百二十只产羔母羊乳成了一百四十七只小羊羔。由于羊群饲养管理的好，产下的一百四十七只羊羔，除一只因生理缺陷死了以外，一百四十六只羊羔全部成活，繁殖率超过了原计划17.8％。大牲口一百一十六头，其中二十七头母畜全部配了种，今年已产骡驹三头，马驹一头，驴驹一头。猪由去年的三十九口发展到一百一十五口。七口大母猪下了七窝，繁殖小猪娃五十五口，到1957年春保证每户达到一口猪。今年畜牧收入总值达到了三千零三十九元，比1955年提高25.3％。畜牧业增产的主要原因是，实行了定额管理和超额奖励制度。大大刺激了牛羊工、饲养员的生产积极性。
    副业—比去年增加收入27％
    红星社在高级合作化以后，根据山区生产的特点，抽出五十八个劳动力，广泛地开展了多种多样的副业生产。今年全社经营的副业生产有一百多种，比1955年增加了刨药材等三十七种。副业收入一万五千六百六十六元，比去年提高27％。
    红星社在高级化的优越条件下坚持了农、林、牧、副全面发展的方针。经过一年来的努力，获得到了全面增产。今年全社的集体总收入折合七万三千四百二十八元，比去年提高41.2％。加上社员个人副业生产收入的二万一千四百三十元，全年的总收入就是九万四千八百五十八元，其中多种经济的收入即达六万零九百六十九元，占到了总收入的64％。经过制定收益分配方案，本着少扣多分的原则，总收入的67％可以分给社员，连同社员的个人收入，全社二百零六户，每户平均纯收入为三百四十二元八角，按现在实有的九百五十八口人计算，每人平均七十三元七角，等于一千二百三十斤粮食。单从粮食收入来看，除交公粮、卖余粮、扣除种籽饲料外，每一口人可以分到口粮五百二十二斤，比去年提高七十二斤。全社除九户因劳力少，生病，收入比去年稍有减少外，其余95.6％的社员户户都比去年增加了收入。由于今年的收入大，社里在8月份以前已给社员预分过八次款。社员刘毛松高兴地说：“高级合作化只有一年，就有这样大的收入，真是没有想到！”
