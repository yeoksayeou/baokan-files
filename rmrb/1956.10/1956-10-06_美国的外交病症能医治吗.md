Title: Can the U.S.'s Diplomatic Ailments Be Cured?

From the thick-coated tongue Uncle Sam often sticks out at the world, he certainly seems like a man with a very strong liver fire.

However, Mr. Dulles is not the real Uncle Sam. He is actually a Wall Street agent wearing the hat of U.S. Secretary of State.

The gold standard diplomacy, the position of strength policy, and the brinkmanship policy he advocates do not come from the American people, but are concocted by the fanatical worshippers of those die-hard industrialists who truly rule the United States.

Arms merchants not only manufacture arms, they also manufacture a concept that the arms race is indispensable for U.S. security. But more and more Americans have begun to doubt this and see that true security lies precisely in the opposite direction. The number of such enlightened Americans is increasing, and may already be a majority.

For the United States, which has no Prussian or Spartan militaristic tradition, it is indeed very abnormal that it has become a military camp in the past decade.

The key to understanding this phenomenon is that Wall Street has made the American people believe that communism wants to change the world by force. Under this smokescreen, Wall Street has stepped up political persecution, causing domestic democracy in the United States to regress, while at the same time engaging in the Cold War, attempting to make the world's democracy also regress. After suffering setbacks everywhere, Wall Street's domestic and foreign strategies are facing bankruptcy.

	The Undercurrent of Democracy
Although the U.S. foreign policy does appear gloomy on the surface, beneath this surface flows a surging undercurrent of democracy, which can break through the surface and rapidly change things.

When Uncle Sam was a child, he cleverly pursued a neutralist foreign policy: "No entangling alliances!" "Gentle diplomacy backed by strength!"

But his precocious wit did not grow with his strength. His youthful aversion to foreign obligations led him to unreasonably undermine the League of Nations after World War I; and his rejection of the Soviet Union's proposal for collective security encouraged the aggression of the Axis powers, which eventually led to the outbreak of World War II.

The slogan "Gentle diplomacy backed by strength" was initially suitable for this young capitalist country that wanted to seize territory for itself without war, but since Uncle Sam has become the recognized heavyweight in the capitalist world, the slogan has become "Tough diplomacy backed by strength."

As a democratic force, the United States has regressed greatly compared to 1776. The country, which in the eighteenth century was a pioneer of colonial liberation movements, has now degenerated into the last bastion of decaying imperialism, shamelessly mocking the right to self-determination of the people of India, China, Korea, Vietnam, Algeria, and Guatemala (to name just a small part).

This young republic expanded its territory under the ambiguous banner of "Manifest Destiny" (Note 1), buying whatever it could (such as its purchase of the Louisiana Territory, Alaska, and the Virgin Islands); and using force to open up whatever it needed to (such as its wars against Mexico and Spain to expand its territory). But in doing so, those greedy fellows tried to make the simple people who actually fought believe that they were fighting against tyranny and for democracy.

Under these circumstances, the people of other countries began to see Americans as cruel robbers, while ordinary Americans still fancied themselves as righteous crusaders.

The Monroe Doctrine is a good example. This policy, unilaterally declared in the last century, was merely a warning to European imperialist powers not to continue expanding their territory in the Americas. The Monroe Doctrine, touted as a long wall against imperialist aggression, was in fact nothing more than dividing the Americas into an exclusive sphere of influence belonging to the equally hideous Wall Street imperialism. Since then, gold standard diplomacy and gunboat visits have controlled most of the American satellite regimes in Latin America.

During President Roosevelt's decade in office, the American democratic tradition had somewhat reappeared through a "Good Neighbor Policy," which was based on signing reciprocal trade agreements with Latin America. But this plan later failed to live up to its name.

	The Declaration of the Cold War
After World War II, powerful private interest groups prompted the United States to abandon the policy of post-war cooperation agreed upon by the Allies at Yalta. A large amount of hate propaganda was injected into the bloodstream of the United States, with the result that the country was turned into a big villain.

The United States encircled the earth with nine hundred and fifty continuous military bases and began to buy or intimidate other countries into military alliances with it. And any country that was unwilling to participate was cursed as an immoral enemy.

To whitewash the moral depravity, the so-called Fourth Point Program of economic assistance was concocted. However, this program was not based on equality and reciprocity at all, but was only to carry out bribery and to find excuses for the infiltration of American capital. Wherever Wall Street's power could reach, it used various methods, from deception to violence, to try to export the "American way." And the countries that accepted "Made in America" "aid" found that this "aid" was a real "Pandora's" box (Note 2), containing countless evils.

This is the background of the American Cold War fanaticism. Can this fanaticism be cured, and can the country truly embark on the road of good neighborliness?

There are two treatments here, which, if carried out simultaneously, can be effective.

On the one hand, no matter how bad the official American bad neighbor behavior is, socialist and neutralist countries should still adhere to a friendly and good-neighborly policy within the limits allowed by human tolerance and national dignity.

At the same time, all democratic forces within the United States should unite to isolate the reactionary forces responsible for the Cold War fanaticism, expose their selfish and self-interested motives, and point out that the peaceful coexistence of different systems is beneficial to everyone.

(Note 1) The so-called "Manifest Destiny" was an excuse used by the United States in the mid-nineteenth century to annex the state of Texas from Mexico.

(Note 2) In Greek mythology, Pandora was the first woman Zeus sent to earth to punish Prometheus for stealing fire from heaven, carrying a box containing the seven deadly sins. When this box was opened, it scattered all disasters to the world.

    美国的外交病症能医治吗
    美国作家　肯尼迪
    从山姆大叔向世界经常伸出的那只舌苔很厚的舌头看来，他的确像是一个肝火非常旺盛的人。
    不过杜勒斯先生并不是真正的山姆大叔。他实际上是戴着美国国务卿牌子的一位华尔街的代理人。
    他所主张的金元外交、实力地位政策、战争边缘政策都不是来自美国人民，而是由真正统治着美国的那些死顽固的实业家的狂热崇拜者所一手泡制的。
    军火商人制造的不仅是军火，他们同时也制造了一种概念，仿佛军备竞赛对于美国的安全是不可缺少的。但是越来越多的美国人已开始对这点发生怀疑，并看出真正的安全恰好是在相反的方面。这类觉悟了的美国人数目越来越多，可能已经占了多数。
    对于没有普鲁士或斯巴达式的军国主义传统的美国来说，它在过去十年中变成了一个军营，的确是十分反常的。
    了解这个现象的关键是华尔街已经使美国人民相信：共产主义是要用武力来改变世界。在这个烟幕下，华尔街加紧进行政治迫害，使美国国内民主向后倒退，同时并进行冷战，想使世界的民主也向后倒退。在到处遭到挫败之后，华尔街的内政、外交战略都面临破产的境地。
          民主的暗流
    虽然美国外交政策在外表上的确显得阴晦，在这个外表的下面，却流着一股汹涌的民主的暗流，这股暗流，可以突破表面而使事物迅速改观。
    当山姆大叔还是孩子的时候，他聪敏地奉行中立主义的外交政策：“不卷入同盟！”“以实力为后盾的温和外交！”
    可是他的早熟的机智并没有与他的力量一同成长。他年轻时对国外义务的厌恶使他在第一次世界大战以后毫无道理地破坏了国际联盟；而他对苏联集体安全的建议的拒绝，鼓励了轴心国家的侵略，这个侵略终于导致了第二次世界大战的爆发。
    “以实力为后盾的温和外交”这个口号，当初对于这个想不用战争就能为自己夺得地盘的年轻的资本主义国家来说，是适合的，但是由于山姆大叔已成为资本主义世界公认的重量级选手，这个口号已经变成“以实力为后盾的强硬外交”。
    作为一支民主力量，比起1776年来，美国已大大倒退了。这个在十八世纪曾经成为殖民地解放运动先锋的国家，现在却退化为腐朽的帝国主义的最后堡垒，厚颜无耻地嘲弄印度、中国、朝鲜、越南、阿尔及利亚、危地马拉（我们姑且举这一小部分）人民的自决权。
    这个年轻的共和国在“显明的神意”（注一）这样一面暧昧的旗帜下扩张着自己的领土，凡是能购买的就购买（如它对路易斯安那领地、阿拉斯加和维尔京群岛的购买）；凡是需要用武力开拓的就用武力开拓（如它为扩张领土而对墨西哥和西班牙进行的战争）。但是在这样做的时候，那些贪婪的家伙却竭力要使那些实际进行战斗的朴实人民相信，他们是在为反对专制、争取民主而斗争。
    在这种情况下，其他国家的人民开始把美国人看做是残忍的抢劫者，而普通的美国人却还把自己幻想作有道义的十字军战士。
    门罗主义就是很好的例子。这个在上世纪被单方面宣布的政策，只不过是警告欧洲帝国主义强国，不许它们在美洲继续扩张领地。被吹嘘为抵抗帝国主义侵略的长城的门罗主义，实际上不过是把美洲划为属于同样丑恶的华尔街帝国主义的独占势力范围罢了。自那时起，金元外交和炮舰访问就控制了大部分拉丁美洲的美国卫星国政权。
    在罗斯福任总统的十年中，美国的民主传统曾多少通过一种“睦邻政策”重新出现，这个政策是以同拉丁美洲签订互惠贸易协定为基础。但是这个计划后来并未能名副其实。
          冷战的宣布
    第二次世界大战以后，强大的私利集团促使美国放弃了盟国在雅尔达所同意的战后合作政策。大量宣传仇恨的毒素注入了美国的血液中，其结果是把这个国家变成了一个大恶棍。
    美国以九百五十个连绵不断的军事基地把地球围绕起来，并开始收买或恫吓其他国家同它实行军事联合。而任何不愿参加的国家都被咒骂为不道德的敌人。
    为了粉饰道义上的堕落，编造了所谓经济援助的第四点计划。但是，这个计划丝毫没有以平等和互惠作基础，而只是为了进行收买，并为美国资本的渗入找借口。凡是华尔街力量能到达的地方，它就用各种方法，由欺骗到暴力，来竭力输出“美国方式”。而接受“美国造”的“援助”的国家，却发现这个“援助”是一个真正的“潘朵拉”的盒子（注二），里面藏着数不尽的祸害。
    美国冷战狂热病的背景就是这样。这种狂热病是否能治愈，这个国家是否能真正走上睦邻的道路呢？
    这里有两种疗法，倘若同时进行，是可以见效的。
    一方面，不论美国官方的坏邻居作风多么恶劣，社会主义和中立主义国家在人类的容忍和国家的尊严所允许的限度内，仍坚持友好睦邻政策。
    同时，美国内部的所有民主因素都集中起来，孤立那些对冷战狂热病负责的反动势力，揭穿它们的自私自利的动机，并指出不同制度的和平共处是对大家有益的。
    （注一）所谓“显明的神意”是十九世纪中叶美国为吞并墨西哥的得克萨斯州所用的借口。
    （注二）希腊神话，潘朵拉是宙斯神为惩罚普罗米修斯偷取天上火种而派到地上来的第一个女人，带着一个盒子，里面藏有七大罪恶，这个盒子打开后，就把一切灾害散布到了世界上。
