Correcting Subjectivism in Industrial Leadership
Jiao Ruoyu, First Secretary of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee

Since the Seventh National Congress, one of the main reasons why our Party has achieved such brilliant successes in various fields is that the Party Central Committee, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, has unswervingly opposed the unhealthy tendencies of subjectivism, especially dogmatism, formulated a correct line for the entire Party, and established the correct work style of seeking truth from facts in Marxism-Leninism.

However, judging from the shortcomings and errors that have occurred in our work, as the Party Central Committee has pointed out, subjectivism still exists in our thinking, and there is even a tendency for it to develop. The Shenyang Municipal Party Committee has made many subjectivist errors in its leadership of industrial work.

In the first three years of the First Five-Year Plan, although we basically completed the tasks of expanding and rebuilding key enterprises and the industrial production plan, the overall industrial development rate was not normal. In 1953, the city's total industrial output value increased by 35.8% compared with the previous year, in 1954 it increased by only 5.1% compared with the previous year, and in 1955 it decreased by 0.8% compared with the previous year. The decline was even greater in local state-owned industries in the latter two years. This was by no means due to insurmountable difficulties in terms of technical strength, equipment, and raw materials in the latter two years that made it impossible for us to continue to move forward. Rather, it was because we lacked foresight about the new situation in which the country's entry into the period of planned construction would inevitably lead to economic reorganization and technological transformation, underestimated the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers in building socialism, and lacked investigation and research into the production potential of enterprises. As a result, under the control of right-leaning conservative thinking, we blindly implemented the passive policy of determining production by sales in 1954, suppressing the enthusiasm of workers and burying the production potential of enterprises. Since this year, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee, we have corrected this subjective right-leaning conservative thinking, and after the vast number of workers have launched a high tide of industrial production, the industrial production landscape of Shenyang has been completely renewed. Under basically the same conditions of manpower and equipment, the total output value of state-owned industries in the city from January to August increased by 58.9% compared with the same period last year, and labor productivity increased by 49.3%. Among them, the total output value of the electromechanical industry increased by 102.9% compared with the same period last year, and labor productivity increased by 72.2%. However, subjectivism has not been completely eliminated. In the mass industrial production upsurge, we did not promptly be vigilant and prevent the eagerness for quick success and rash advance in some enterprises. Some industrial management departments also once ignored the difficulties in the supply of materials, technology, etc., and allowed or even supported enterprises to repeatedly increase production plans. As a result, there was a shortage of materials and an excessively tense production situation. After the Central Committee pointed out the trend of opposing blind advancement, some industrial management agencies reversed the attitude of encouraging enterprises to "increase, increase, increase" regardless of everything in February and March this year, and under the threat of material difficulties, it seemed that they had come up with a "reduce, reduce, reduce" without asking any questions. Taking the Shenyang Air Compressor Factory as an example, although it was able to solve the material problem by itself, it still had to reduce the annual plan by 20%, which would leave the entire factory's employees with almost nothing to do for a quarter of the year. Another example is the Shenyang Water Pump Factory, which initially determined to produce 8,800 water pumps throughout the year, but in May the competent bureau ordered it to be reduced to 6,900 units, and it was not allowed to produce even one more unit. In June, it suddenly ordered that in addition to guaranteeing an increase of 130 units, it should try its best to increase production by another one or two thousand units. This kind of industrial management method of "increase, increase, increase" and "reduce, reduce, reduce", increasing and decreasing, and decreasing and increasing, is obviously a manifestation of subjectivism and bureaucracy.

In the Party's work and mass work in enterprises, this subjective tendency is also quite serious.

The Party should and must lead industry, which is beyond doubt, but how the Party should lead industry has become a problem that has not been resolved for a long time. In the past few years, the Party organizations of some enterprises in Shenyang City, proceeding from the specific situation of enterprise work, have explored and applied the experience of combining the Party committee's collective leadership and individual responsibility, which is traditional to our Party, and achieved good results. We have summarized and promoted it. However, when some people, on the grounds of the particularity of enterprises, one-sidedly emphasized that the factory director must be given full authority to lead the enterprise in order to ensure effective leadership of modern enterprises, we did not conduct specific analysis and research based on existing experience and the Party's leadership principles, and blindly implemented it, resulting in the phenomenon of factory directors making arbitrary decisions, not respecting the Party committee's collective leadership, and seriously reducing the Party's leading role in enterprises in many enterprises. Although we had long felt that something was wrong, we never clearly recognized that this was an error that violated the Party's leadership principles. Even after studying the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session and criticizing errors in this regard, we still did not completely free ourselves from the argument of enterprise particularity and quickly and resolutely promote the leadership system that combines the Party committee's collective leadership and individual division of labor in enterprises, in order to thoroughly correct the long-standing chaotic phenomenon. This shows how serious our ideological one-sidedness and lack of a fact-seeking attitude are.

In the mass work of enterprises, subjective errors are also common. Here, only some issues in the socialist competition will be discussed. Socialist competition is a lively mass movement that is good at mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of workers. The important responsibility of leaders is to go deep into the competition activities and summarize and promote advanced experience in a timely manner. However, in the past few years, we have focused on solving how to formulate competition conditions, study competition forms, and evaluate rewards, while paying insufficient attention to the promotion of advanced experience. Therefore, the masses call it "hot at both ends and cold in the middle." When learning from the experience of other regions and enterprises in organizing competitions, instead of flexibly applying it according to the specific situation, we attempted to formulate a unified regulation or plan for organizing competitions and mechanically transplanted it, restricting the competition activities of many enterprises with their own different characteristics to a framework. As a result, the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of workers were bound, and formalism and generality have long existed in labor competitions. This situation only changed after the struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking and the upsurge of industrial production. This erroneous practice is obviously due to subjective and dogmatic errors in thinking.

Why has the tendency of subjectivism developed?

The emergence and development of subjective errors naturally have their social roots. However, for cadres like us who have undergone rectification studies and have been trained under the correct leadership of the Central Committee for a long time, the development of this subjective tendency is due, on the one hand, to our insufficient rectification and theoretical studies in combination with our daily work, and therefore our ideological level and ability to distinguish right from wrong are still very low. On the other hand, and more importantly, we lack vigilance against the subjective errors that are prone to occur in the face of new things in the continuous victory of the revolution and the continuous development of work, and we lack timely analysis of the root causes of the shortcomings and errors that occur in our work to raise them to the level of awareness. Coupled with the growth of complacency, all of this has promoted the development of subjectivism.

The increasingly heavy tasks of socialist transformation and socialist construction require every leading link of our Party to improve its Marxist-Leninist ideological level and to be vigilant and overcome subjectivism at all times. We fully agree with the several measures proposed by Comrade Shaoqi in the political report to improve the Marxist-Leninist level of our Party, and we will earnestly strengthen the systematic study of Marxism-Leninism, examine our work, reflect on our thoughts, and criticize subjectivism from the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method. In addition to further strengthening the leadership of theoretical studies for on-the-job cadres, we have organized middle and senior cadres to begin studying five articles such as "Reform Our Study" in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee. In the future, in conjunction with the study of the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, we will continue to strengthen the leadership of this study and make it a rectification movement for the Shenyang City Party organization to further oppose subjectivism and improve its Marxist-Leninist ideological level. At the same time, we must also pay attention to deeply inspecting and summarizing our work in our daily work in accordance with the Party's line and policies, in order to promptly discover and eliminate dogmatic or empirical errors.

The long-standing bureaucratic work style in our work is also one of the reasons for fueling subjectivism. Because organizational structures are becoming increasingly large, and there are more and more meetings and documents, there is less and less in-depth investigation and research among the masses and into reality, which has led us to gradually embark on the road of bureaucracy. Without a clear understanding of the actual situation and without a deep understanding of the Party's line and policies, partiality and blindness will inevitably occur in our understanding, and thus subjective errors will inevitably be made in our work. Therefore, effectively improving our working methods and eradicating bureaucracy is an important link in overcoming subjectivism and establishing a correct work style of seeking truth from facts. We are taking concrete measures from improving the arrangement of work tasks, streamlining institutions, strengthening investigation and research, reducing meetings and documents, and fully promoting democracy, in order to gradually overcome bureaucracy.

In addition, some higher-level departments set tasks that are too large and too urgent, emphasizing departmental work as the central task of the entire Party, issuing directives one by one and unrelated to each other, creating a situation of "thousands of threads from above and one needle below," which puts lower-level organizations in a state of being exhausted all the time. Some higher-level departments attempt to apply one plan or measure universally to all regions and enterprises, without any room for flexibility, and some higher-level departments only rely on holding meetings and issuing documents to carry out their work, managing too many trivial matters and doing too little investigation and research. All of this will inevitably lead to subjective and bureaucratic errors in actual work. Therefore, according to the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, it is also very necessary to inspect and correct subjectivism from top to bottom.

    纠正工业领导上的主观主义
    中共沈阳市委员会第一书记　焦若愚
    七大以来，我们党在各方面，所以能够取得如此辉煌的成就，最主要原因之一，是以毛泽东同志为首的党中央坚持不渝地反对了主观主义，特别是教条主义的歪风，为全党制定了正确的路线，和树立了马克思列宁主义的实事求是的正确作风。
    但是，从目前我们工作中所发生的缺点和错误来看，正如党中央所指出的，在我们的思想上还存在着主观主义，甚至有发展的趋势。我们沈阳市委在工业工作的领导上，就存在着不少主观主义的错误。
    第一个五年计划的前三年，我们虽然基本上完成了重点企业的扩建改建任务与工业生产计划，但是，总的来看，工业发展速度是不够正常的。1953年全市工业总产值较上年增加了35.8％，1954年较上年只增加了5.1％，1955年较上年反而下降了0.8％，其中地方国营工业在后两年下降的更多。这决不是由于后两年在技术力量、设备、原材料等方面发生了不可克服的困难，使我们无法继续前进。而是由于：对国家进入有计划建设时期必然引起经济改组和技术改造的新情况缺乏预见，对广大职工建设社会主义的积极性估计不足，对企业生产潜力缺乏调查研究，以致在右倾保守思想支配下，在1954年盲目地执行了以销定产的消极方针，压抑了职工的积极性，埋没了企业的生产潜力。今年以来，根据中央指示，纠正了这种主观主义的右倾保守思想，广大职工掀起工业生产高潮之后，沈阳市的工业生产面貌，便焕然一新。在人力、设备基本相同的条件下，全市国营工业1至8月的生产总值较去年同期增加了58.9％，劳动生产率提高了49.3％，其中机电工业生产总值较去年同期则增加了102.9％，劳动生产率提高了72.2％。但是，主观主义并没有从此肃清。在群众性的工业生产高潮中，我们没有及时警惕与防止某些企业的急躁冒进情绪。有些工业管理部门也曾一度忽视材料、技术等供应上的困难，听任甚至支持企业生产计划一再增加。结果造成材料供应不足和生产过分紧张的状况。在中央指出反对盲目冒进倾向之后，某些工业管理机关又一反今年二、三月间不顾一切地鼓励企业“增增增”的态度，在材料困难的威胁下，似乎又来了个不问情由地“减减减”。以沈阳空气压缩机厂为例，虽然自己能够解决材料问题，也硬要削减全年计划的20％，这样，将使全厂职工几乎一个季度无活可干。再如沈阳水泵厂年初确定全年生产水泵八千八百台，5月份主管局命令减为六千九百台，多产一台也不行，6月间忽又命令除了保证增产一百三十台以外，尽可能争取再增产一两千台。像这种“增增增”“减减减”增了减，减了增的管理工业的方法，显然是主观主义和官僚主义的表现。
    在企业党的工作和群众工作中，这种主观主义的倾向，也是相当严重的。
    党应该和必须领导工业，这是无人怀疑的，但是，党如何领导工业，却成为长期没有解决的问题。几年来，沈阳市一部分企业的党组织，从企业工作的具体情况出发，曾经摸索着运用了我们党传统的党委集体领导和个人负责相结合的经验，收到了较好的效果，我们曾经进行了总结和推广。但是，在有人以企业特殊性的理由，片面强调必须给予厂长个人以领导企业的全权，才能保证对现代化企业实行有效领导的时候，我们没有根据已有的经验和党的领导原则，进行具体地分析研究，就盲目地执行起来，致使不少企业发生厂长独断专行，不尊重党委集体领导，严重降低党在企业中的领导作用的现象。虽然我们早就感到有些不妥，但是从来没有明确地认识这是违反党的领导原则的错误。甚至在学习四中全会决议批判了这方面的错误之后，我们仍然没有从企业特殊性的论调中完全解脱出来，迅速而坚决地在企业中推行党委集体领导和个人分工负责相结合的领导制度，以彻底纠正存在已久的混乱现象。由此可见，我们思想上的片面性，缺乏实事求是的态度，是多么严重。
    在企业的群众工作中，主观主义的错误也是屡见不鲜的。在这里只谈社会主义竞赛中的一些问题。社会主义竞赛是一种生动活泼的善于发挥广大职工积极性和创造性的群众运动，领导者的重要职责是深入到竞赛活动中及时总结推广先进经验。但是，几年来我们却偏重了解决如何制定竞赛条件，研究竞赛形式以及评比奖励等问题，而对推广先进经验则注意不够，因此，群众称之为“两头热，中间冷”。在学习其他地区、企业组织竞赛的经验时，不是按照具体情况灵活地运用，而是企图制定一个统一的组织竞赛的条例或方案，机械地搬运，把许多企业具有各自不同特点的竞赛活动，限制到一个框子里去，结果束缚了广大职工的积极性和创造性，使劳动竞赛长期存在着形式主义和一般化的毛病。这种情况只是在经过反对右倾保守思想的斗争和掀起工业生产高潮之后，才有了改变。这种错误的做法，显然是由于思想上的主观主义、教条主义的错误造成的。
    为什么主观主义的倾向有所发展呢？
    主观主义错误的产生和发展，自然有其社会根源，但是，对于我们这样的经过整风学习和在中央正确路线领导下锻炼较久的干部来说，这种主观主义倾向的发展，一方面是由于我们结合日常工作进行整风和理论学习不够，因而我们的思想水平、明辨是非的能力还很低；更重要的一方面，则是我们对于在革命不断胜利、工作不断发展的新事物面前容易发生主观主义错误，缺乏警惕，对于工作中发生的缺点和错误，缺乏及时地提高到认识的根源上加以分析；再加以骄傲自满情绪的滋长，这一切，就促成了主观主义的发展。
    日益繁重的社会主义改造和社会主义建设任务，要求我们党的每一个领导环节提高马克思列宁主义思想水平，时时警惕和克服主观主义。我们完全同意少奇同志在政治报告中提出的提高我们党的马克思列宁主义水平的几项措施，认真加强系统的马克思列宁主义的学习，以马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法，检查工作，反省思想，批判主观主义。我们除了进一步加强对在职干部理论学习的领导外，已经根据中央指示，组织中、高级干部开始学习“改造我们的学习”等五篇文章。今后结合学习党的八次大会文件，继续加强对这一学习的领导，使它成为沈阳市党组织进一步反对主观主义、提高马克思列宁主义思想水平的整风运动。同时，我们还要在日常工作中，经常注意根据党的路线和政策，深入地检查总结工作，以便及时发现教条主义或经验主义的错误，加以清除。
    我们工作中长期存在的官僚主义作风，也是助长主观主义的原因之一。由于组织机构越来越庞大，会议和文件也越来越多，因而深入群众深入实际进行调查研究，则越来越少，这就使我们一步一步走上了官僚主义的道路。对于实际情况心中无数，对于党的路线和政策领会不深，必然在认识上发生片面性和盲目性，从而在工作中必然犯主观主义的错误。因此，切实改进工作方法，铲除官僚主义，是克服主观主义、树立实事求是的正确作风的重要一环。我们正在从改进工作任务的安排、精简机构、加强调查研究、减少会议和文件以及充分发扬民主等方面，采取具体措施，以便逐渐克服官僚主义。
    另外，有些上级部门确定的任务过大过急，把部门工作强调成为全党的中心任务，条条下达，各不相关，造成“上面千条线，下面一根针”，使下级组织经常处在疲于奔命的状态；有些上级部门企图以一个方案或措施，通用于各地各企业，毫无机动的余地，也有些上级部门只是依靠开会、发文件进行工作，事务问题管得多，调查研究做得少。这一切，便不可避免地在实际工作中犯主观主义和官僚主义的错误。因此，根据党的第八次全国代表大会的精神，自上而下地检查和纠正主观主义，也是十分必要的。
