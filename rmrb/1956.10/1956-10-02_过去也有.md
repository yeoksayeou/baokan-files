"It Happened in the Past Too"
　　Yan Ning

I don't know when it started, but bureaucrats have suddenly found a new "argument" to defend their mistakes. According to them, the things they are doing wrong now "happened in the past too," so there's no need to make a fuss. For example, the Xinwei District Committee of the Yongning County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Guangxi Province did not take into account the special circumstances of women in leading production, causing some women to miscarry due to overwork. The female cadre Pang Peihua reported this matter to the Guangxi Daily. Huang Weicong, the district party secretary, believed that "miscarriages of women are not only happening now, but also happened in the past, perhaps even more severely than now. However, in the past, people didn't pay attention, so they didn't notice. Now you are deliberately looking for problems, so you see more." (See Guangxi Daily, September 1st, third page, "Is there 'danger' in truthfully reflecting the situation?")

This "it happened in the past too" argument is quite popular among some people. Many completely avoidable mistakes or losses—such as cattle dying that shouldn't have died, people dying that shouldn't have died, commodities going out of stock that shouldn't have gone out of stock, etc.—are all explained by bureaucrats as "it happened in the past too." This summer, in the Ping Le Special District of Guangxi Province, many farmers fled to Hunan Province due to the poor development of local sideline production and the serious shortcomings in the unified purchase and sale of grain. Such a major event was even met with the following statement from a responsible comrade of the Ping Le District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: "Farmers fleeing to Hunan during the summer famine also happened under the Kuomintang." It is very clear that the reason these people are so mindful of the "past" is to downplay major issues and make minor issues disappear, with the ultimate conclusion being that they did nothing wrong.

Of the things that "happened in the past too," there are only two types that matter. One is things that are beneficial to the people, which should be promoted and developed, and there is no need to say more. The other is things that are detrimental to the people, which should be avoided or eliminated. If our mistakes can also be explained by "it happened in the past too," then it is clearly a satire of ourselves as revolutionary workers!

### “过去也有”

    “过去也有”　　
    严凝
    不知从什么时候起，官僚主义者忽又找到了一个新的“论据”来为自己的错误辩护。据他们说，现在他们所做错的那些事情都是“过去也有”的，不必大惊小怪。例如中共广西邕宁县心圩区区委会在领导生产中不照顾妇女的特殊情况，使有些妇女因劳动过度而流产。妇女干部庞佩华向广西日报反映了这件事，区委书记黄为聪认为“妇女小产不单现在有，过去也有，可能比现在还要严重，不过过去没有注意，所以没有发现，现在你们专门去找问题就见多。”（见九月一日广西日报第三版“真实反映情况有‘危险’吗？”）
    这个“过去也有”论在某些人中是颇为流行的。很多完全可以避免的错误或损失——如不应该死的牛死了，不应该死的人死了，不应该脱销的商品脱销了等等，官僚主义者一概都解释为“过去也有”。广西平乐专区今夏有很多农民因当地副业生产没有搞好，粮食统购统销也存在严重缺点，以致有些人相率逃荒至湖南。这样一件大事，中共平乐地委会某负责同志竟也这样说：“农民在夏荒时流亡到湖南，这在国民党时也是有的。”很显明，这些人所以念念不忘“过去”，目的就是要把大事化小，小事化无，最后的结论是他们并没有做错什么事情。
    “过去也有”的事大只有两种，一种是对人民有利的事，这应该加以发扬光大，无须多说。一种是对人民不利的事，这应该想法避免或消灭。如果我们的错误也可以用“过去也有”来解释的话，那显然是对于作为革命工作人员的自己的讽刺！
