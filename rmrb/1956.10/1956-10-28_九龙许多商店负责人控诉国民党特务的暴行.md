Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 27th: Hong Kong News: According to the "Wen Wei Po" newspaper, many store owners have described the atrocities of Kuomintang secret agents who looted shops during the Kowloon riots.

According to the person in charge of Da Feng Company and eyewitnesses, around 11 p.m. on October 10th, a mysterious car appeared in front of the store. Two men dressed in suits, looking like refined individuals, carried a sack of stones from the car onto the street, and then the car drove away.

After a while, secret agent thugs appeared at the entrance, numbering about fifty. A man in a light blue suit shouted, "Throw it!" Stones rained down on the door of Da Feng Company. The company's person in charge called the police for help at the time. Seeing that the door was about to be destroyed, the employees had no choice but to break out and escape. Soon, the secret agent thugs broke into the store and burned the goods, furniture, and documents on the street.

After they broke into the store, at around 11:45 p.m. that night, police appeared nearby, and several tear gas explosions were heard. However, the police did not reach the scene of the incident, and the secret agent thugs shouted loudly, "Go overturn the police car!" "Go burn the police car!" After that, no more tear gas explosions were heard nearby. The secret agent thugs continued to do whatever they pleased.

About one hundred and fifty secret agents and thugs looted and vandalized the store, carrying things to the street to burn. At around 3 a.m., several people who seemed to be in charge shouted orders: "Let's go to Heung To (Middle School)!" "Go burn Heung To!" Following them, several people carrying flags led about a hundred people away, howling. The remaining people, led by a man in a white Hawaiian shirt and brown trousers and a man in a white Hawaiian shirt and gray trousers, gestured and directed the destruction, and took the lead in clapping and shouting "Victory!"

These two commanders did not leave from the beginning of the incident until 5 a.m. The thugs destroyed everything in the store. Radios were carried away, boxes of goods were carried away, and the looting lasted for a long time. In total, the loss of goods looted and burned by the secret agents and thugs amounted to more than 48,000 yuan.

The person in charge of the company said angrily: We are doing legitimate business and paying taxes, so why haven't we received the Hong Kong government's protection for our legitimate business and safety? These leper-dog-like guys are unscrupulous, carrying out cruel and inhumane acts everywhere, so why weren't they stopped in time?

The Xin Zhong Food Company, located at 63 Tai Po Road, was pried open and looted by thugs around midnight on the 11th, and then set on fire. According to the manager of the company, the thugs knocked on the doors of shops one by one around 10 p.m. on the 10th, ordering them to "turn on the lights to celebrate National Day." A group of thugs went to Xin Zhong's door and, on the pretext of not having the lights on, immediately threw stones as a warning. At around midnight on the 11th, a large number of thugs gathered again in front of Xin Zhong's door and pried the door open with iron pens. The employees in the store did not dare to resist and all retreated from the back door. Then the thugs broke in very calmly, smashed all the display cabinets, shelves, and refrigerators, and threw a piece of wooden furniture and goods onto the road to burn.

The company manager also said: In addition to wantonly looting local products, general merchandise, and canned goods, the bandits also looted personal belongings of the shop assistants. Some people saw with their own eyes the thugs taking off their wooden clogs and putting on leather shoes, or changing into the clothes of the shop assistants. Until about 1 a.m., most of the goods in the store were cleared out, and the thugs set a fire in the loft before leaving, and also carried away a large "safe." This "safe" contained more than 3,000 yuan in cash and a stack of receipts. According to subsequent statistics, the total loss was estimated to be worth about 60,000 yuan.

De Feng Food Company, located at 197 Castle Peak Road, was looted around 5 p.m. on the 11th. At that time, a group of thugs violently rammed the iron gate at the front door, but could not open it for half an hour. Some of the thugs turned to attack the back door, but the back door was also unbreakable. The thugs continued to use various iron tools to hit the back wall. At around 6 p.m., with a loud noise, the back wall and the back door were knocked down by the thugs. At this time, it was very close to curfew, and the thugs stepped up the pace of moving the goods away in large quantities. Finally, they broke the steel refrigerator and looted all the frozen Peking ducks. Although a curfew was in effect that night, small groups of thugs continued to enter and exit the store from the back door. When the curfew was temporarily lifted at 10 a.m. on the 12th, the thugs regrouped and set fire to the storefront.

According to the person in charge of De Feng Company, since the riots occurred, the store's goods and decorations have been completely destroyed, and the estimated total loss is worth about 60,000 yuan. When the thugs began to attack the store, he telegraphed the Sham Shui Po Police Station for help, but no police came that day.

Chow’s Gold Shop, located at 201 Nam Cheong Street, was also broken into, vandalized, and looted at around midnight on the 11th by thugs, claiming that it did not turn on the lights to celebrate "National Day". The owner of the shop said: That night, the thugs used iron tools to break open the iron gate of the store, destroyed all the decorations, and robbed more than 4,000 yuan of goldware that had not been put into storage. The bandits originally wanted to open the gold shop's safe, but fortunately the person in charge of the safe's key ran away in advance. They groped around for a while without success, and then left the store dejectedly.

    九龙许多商店负责人控诉国民党特务的暴行
    新华社广州27日电　香港消息：据“文汇报”报道，许多家商店负责人叙述国民党特务分子在九龙暴乱中洗劫商店的暴行。
    据大丰公司的负责人和目击者说，10月10日晚十一时许，门前就出现一架神秘的汽车，两个穿西装打扮得似乎是斯文的人，在车上抬了一麻袋石子到街上，接着车子开走了。
    隔了一会，特务暴徒们出现在门口，约有半百人左右。有个穿浅蓝色西装的人喝道：“掷它！”石头就如雨点般掷到大丰公司的门上。公司的负责人当时曾报警求救。眼见大门将被撞毁，员工们无奈突围逃命。不久，特务暴徒闯入店内，把货物、家私、文件搬到街上焚毁。
    在他们冲入店内以后，即当晚十一时四十五分，曾有警察在附近出现，并听到有几响催泪弹声。但是警察没有到达肇事地点，特务暴徒们大声吆喝：“去推翻警车！”“去烧警车！”此后附近也没有听到催泪弹声。特务暴徒仍为所欲为。
    大概有一百五十名特务和暴徒在店内抢掠捣乱，搬东西到街外焚烧。当晚三点钟左右，有几个好像担任指挥的人大声发布命令：“我们拉队去香岛（中学）！”“去烧香岛！”随着就有几个担旗的人，领着约一百人呼啸而去。余下来的人仍由一个穿着白夏威夷衫、咖啡色长裤及一个穿白夏威夷衫、灰长裤的男子，指手划脚的指挥破坏，又带头拍手疾呼“胜利！”
    这两个指挥者从事情开始到深夜五点钟也没有离去。暴徒们把店内东西破坏尽净。收音机被抬走，成箱的货物被抬走，长时间被搜劫。总计这次被特务、暴徒们抢掠及焚烧的货物，损失达四万八千多元。
    这家公司的负责人愤愤地说：我们做正当生意的人，也纳税，为什么没有得到香港政府对我们的合法事业和安全给予保障？这些如癞狗似的家伙，无所忌惮，到处干其残忍无道的行为，为什么没有及时制止？
    位于大埔道六十三号的新中食品公司，在11日凌晨零时许被暴徒撬门洗劫，并纵火焚烧。据这家公司的经理说：暴徒于10日晚十时许便逐家商店拍门，命令“着灯祝国庆”。一股暴徒走到新中门前，借口没有亮灯，立即掷石警告。到11日凌晨零时许，大批暴徒再集结新中门前，纷纷以铁笔撬门。店内员工不敢抵抗，全部从后门撤退。随后暴徒便很从容地弄破铁闸入内，把饰柜、货架、雪柜全部捣毁，并将一部木器、货物掷出马路燃烧。
    该公司经理又说：众匪除了恣意劫掠土特产、百货、罐头之外，还劫掠店伴私人财物。有人亲眼见到暴徒脱下木屐换皮鞋，或换穿店伴衣服。直至凌晨一时许，店中货物大半清仓了，暴徒便在阁仔放一把火燃烧，临行前还将一个大“保险箱”抬走。这“保险箱”内存有现款三千多元及一束单据。事后统计各项损失约值六万元左右。
    青山道一九七号德丰食品公司是11日下午五时左右被洗劫的。当时有一批暴徒在前门猛撞铁闸，历时半句钟不能开启。一部分暴徒便转向后门攻击，但后门也牢不可破。暴徒继续使用各种铁器撞击后墙，下午六时左右隆然一声巨响，后墙及后门一起被暴徒弄倒了。这时距戒严时间很近，暴徒加紧将货物大批大批搬走，最后打破钢雪柜，把冻藏的北京填鸭也劫掠一空，当晚虽然实施宵禁，小股暴徒仍不断从后门进出该店。到12日上午十时暂时解禁，众暴徒重新集结，并纵火焚烧铺面。
    据德丰公司负责人说：自暴乱发生后，该店货物及装修都荡然无存了，估计全部损失约值六万元左右。在暴徒开始向该店袭击时，他曾电告深水埗警署求援，但当天始终没有警察来过。
    南昌街二零一号周先生金铺，被暴徒同样借口说没有开灯庆祝“国庆”，在11日凌晨零时许入内捣毁及洗劫一空。该店东主说：当夜暴徒使用铁器将店面铁闸撞开后，捣毁一切装饰，将未入仓的金器四千余元劫走，群匪本来还想弄开金店的保险仓，幸亏管仓匙的人事先逃跑，他们瞎弄一阵不逞，才悻悻然离开该店。
