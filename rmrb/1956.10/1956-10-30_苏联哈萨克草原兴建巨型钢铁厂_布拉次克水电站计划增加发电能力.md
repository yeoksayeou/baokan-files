Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch: According to a TASS report: Construction of a steel enterprise covering one hundred square kilometers has recently begun on the Kazakhstan steppe in the Soviet Union. The Karaganda Metallurgical Plant is one of the most important projects during the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan (1956-1960). Its production capacity will be similar to the world-renowned Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, and the steel it produces will be the cheapest in the entire Soviet Union. Each blast furnace at the Karaganda Metallurgical Plant has an effective volume of over 1,500 cubic meters, which is larger than the largest blast furnaces in the Urals, Siberia, and Southern Ukraine.

The iron ore reserves on the Kazakhstan steppe are much richer than those in the Urals, Krivoy Rog, Siberia, and Kerch. Moreover, the abundant smelting materials such as Karaganda's coking coal, Topar's limestone, and Baikonur's refractory dolomite happen to surround this metallurgical plant, creating uniquely favorable conditions for the rapid development of the enterprise.

Before 1960, in addition to the two blast furnaces with an annual output of 1.35 million tons of pig iron that will be put into operation at this huge steel base, a series of equipment such as continuous steel plate rolling mills, ore dressing, and sintering plants will also be put into production.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th: The power generation capacity of the world's largest Bratsk Hydropower Station will be increased from 3.2 million kilowatts to 3.6 million kilowatts, a decision made by Soviet scientists after careful research.

Originally, it was decided to install sixteen of the world's largest water turbines in this hydropower station. Now it has been discovered that two more units can be added. These two water turbines will be installed after the Siberian unified power system is established.

The giant water turbines are being designed and manufactured by the Leningrad Machine Building Factory. Each water turbine has a power generation capacity of 200,000 kilowatts, which is almost twice as large as the water turbines used in the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station, and 70,000 kilowatts larger than the water turbines designed by Sweden.

    苏联哈萨克草原兴建巨型钢铁厂
    布拉次克水电站计划增加发电能力
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联一座占地一百平方公里的钢铁企业的建筑工程，最近已经在哈萨克草原上动工兴建。卡拉干达冶金工厂是苏联第六个五年计划（1956—1960年）期间最重要的工程之一。它的生产能力将和闻名世界的马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂相仿，而它生产的钢铁将是全苏联最便宜的。卡拉干达冶金工厂每座高炉的有效容积超过一千五百立方公尺，比乌拉尔、西伯利亚和南乌克兰最大的高炉还要大。
    哈萨克草原上的铁矿蕴藏量比乌拉尔、克里沃罗格、西伯利亚和刻赤的铁矿要丰富得多，而卡拉干达的焦煤、托帕尔的石灰石和拜科努尔的耐火白云石等丰富的冶炼材料产地恰好环绕在这个冶金工厂附近，为迅速地发展企业创造了独特的优越条件。
    在1960年以前，在这个巨大的钢铁基地上，除了两座年产一百三十五万吨生铁的高炉将开工生产外，还将有一系列的设备，例如连续生产的钢板轧机、选矿和烧结工厂等投入生产。
    新华社莫斯科29日电　世界最大的布拉次克水电站的发电能力，将从三百二十万瓩增加到三百六十万瓩，这是苏联科学家经过缜密的研究后决定的。
    在这座水电站里，原来决定安装十六台世界最大的水轮机，现在发现可以再添装两台，这两台水轮机将在西伯利亚统一电力系统建立以后安装。
    巨大无匹的水轮机正由列宁格勒机器制造工厂设计制造中，每台水轮机的发电能力是二十万瓩，比古比雪夫水电站所使用的水轮机将近大一倍，比瑞典设计的水轮机还要大七万瓩。
