"Daddy Has to Operate"
Huang Peiyu

Saturday afternoon, the surgery finished late, I slept late, and my body was exceptionally tired. I couldn't bother with the moving music from the evening party, and I fell asleep as soon as I lay down. Even in my dreams, I was still startled by the patients' conditions.

"Doctor Huang! Doctor Sha is asking you to go to the ward quickly!" This sudden voice had probably been calling for a while, otherwise, how could my soundly sleeping daughter, Xiaomi'er, have woken up? Xiaomi'er is only two years old. She climbed to the bedside, propped herself up with her little hands, and looked up at me innocently, saying, "Daddy, you're getting up! You're going to work!" I was anxious about the patients, hurriedly put on my clothes, but I still had to comfort her with a few words: "Right! Right! Xiaomi'er, go back to sleep! We'll go to Xuanwu Lake tomorrow." Actually, it can't be tomorrow. It is now 2:35 AM on Sunday morning. In the dark, I stepped on the rocks and weeds and rushed to the ward in one breath, only to find out that it wasn't that the patients had any major changes, but that two women in difficult labor had arrived. So my assistant and I hurriedly scrubbed our hands and performed the deliveries. Fortunately, everything went smoothly, and both mothers and babies were safe. I looked up and saw the red light of dawn just breaking in the east. I took off my gloves, removed my mask, and took a deep breath, feeling exceptionally relaxed and comfortable. I bought two servings of fried breadsticks and soybean milk from the hospital entrance, dipped them in sesame oil and soy sauce as usual, which is my favorite taste to enjoy on Sundays. After eating the fried breadsticks and soybean milk, and a bowl of soaked rice, I went to the ward without even looking at my daughter. Who knew the ward was already changing shifts, and I was already a few minutes late. Regret was naturally unavoidable.

Although I don't see outpatients today, there are many emergency cases, many patients being discharged, and many family members visiting patients. I hadn't even finished morning rounds when the eldest son of the old lady in bed 174 kept urging me to talk to him about his mother's infected wound. As soon as the eldest son finished explaining, the old lady's second son came to question me again, and I had to explain everything from the beginning again. Then the patient in bed 152 had financial difficulties and came to ask the doctor to help her find a solution. Before I could come up with a solution here, a dangerous patient with excessive bleeding in shock was carried in. Everyone immediately began emergency treatment, immediately matching and transfusing blood, and also infusing saline and giving some injections. The patient's consciousness finally began to recover, and the pulse and blood pressure also improved. Only when the patient gets better, the doctor can feel half of the weight being lifted off his shoulders. In order to save time, everyone took turns eating. My comrades let me go first. Before I even walked through the door, my daughter shouted as if we had been separated for a long time, "Daddy's back! Daddy's back!" I picked her up in my arms, she wrapped her arms around my neck, and her forehead pressed tightly against my chest, silent for a long time. My younger uncle deliberately took the opportunity to coax her, "Xiaomi'er, today is Sunday, let Daddy take you to Xuanwu Lake." Xiaomi'er looked at my expressionless face, she seemed to understand completely, like comforting herself, and also like explaining to others, nodding her head slightly, saying, "Daddy has to operate." After speaking, she busily pressed her head against my chest again; I felt sad, but still had no expression.

Xiaomi'er usually goes to the nursery, and she only eats at home on Sundays. I had just picked up my bowl when a worker sent over a medical record, it was an emergency consultation from the internal medicine department. I had to swallow the half-mouthful of rice I had in my mouth, put down my bowl and chopsticks, and leave.

In the afternoon, I planned to take a short nap and then finish the materials that the superiors were urging me to submit, but coincidentally, a woman with retained placenta in the Post and Telecommunications Hospital needed a consultation. After returning from the consultation, I went to the ward to check on a few key patients and finished writing the "doctor's orders," it was already evening. Passing through the second gate, Comrade Liu from the operating room asked me if I was busy today, and I said, "It's okay, not too busy." Because there were no emergency patients requiring surgery today.

At dinner time, walking through the bustling Zhongshan Road, I saw so many cars and people returning from their tired travels. I envied their happiness and contentment, and silently prayed in my heart that next Sunday I could definitely take Xiaomi'er to Xuanwu Lake once, to prevent her from saying again, "Daddy has to operate"!

    “爸爸要开刀”
    黄沛雨
    星期六下午手术完得晚，睡得迟，身体分外疲倦，顾不得耳边传来动人的晚会音乐，一躺上床便睡去，睡梦中还不时为病人情况而惊悸。
    “黄医生！沙医生请你快去病房！”这突然的声音，大概叫了好一会儿了，要不然，我那熟睡的女儿——小米儿怎末也会醒来？小米儿才两岁多，他爬在床边，撑着小手，昂起头，天真地对我说：“爸爸，你起来啦，你起来上班啦！”我心里焦虑着病人，急忙穿上衣服，同时却又不得不安慰她几句；“对！对！小米儿，快睡吧！明天好去玄武湖。”其实，不能说明天了。现在已是星期天的上午二时三十五分了。黑暗中我踏着乱石和杂草，一口气赶到病房，才知道并不是病人有什么大的变化，而是来了两位难产产妇。于是我和我的助手，连忙刷手，进行手术分娩，前后经过总算顺利，两位产妇大小均告平安，举目看见窗外红光初露的东方，我脱去手套，拿下口罩，深深呼吸一下，感到异常轻松舒适。从医院门口买了两付烧饼油条，回家用些麻油酱油蘸蘸，照例是我在星期天欣赏的好味道，吃完烧饼油条，一碗水泡饭，来不及看女儿一眼，就去病房。谁知病房已在交班，已经迟到了几分钟，悔恨自然不在话下。
    今天虽然不看门诊，可是急症多，出院的病人多，来探视病人的家属也多。早上查病房还没有查完，174床老太太的大儿子，为了他母亲伤口被感染就催着要跟我谈话，大儿子才解释完，老太太的二儿子又来责问，我又得从头再解释。接着152床病人经济发生困难，来要医生给她想办法，这里我的办法还未想出，那边抬来一个流血过多陷于休克的危险病人，大家立刻进行急救，马上配血输血，又输盐水，打了一些针药，病人的神智才开始恢复，脉搏血压也有了好转。病人好转，医生的千斤重担，才放下一半。为了争取时间，大家轮流吃饭，同志们让我先走，我还没有走进大门，女儿好像久别重逢，高声叫喊：“爸爸回来啰！爸爸回来啰！”我双手将她抱起，她双手吊住我的脖子，额角紧贴在我的胸口，好久一声不响。小舅舅有意地乘机怂恿她：“小米儿，今天是星期天，让爸爸带你去玄武湖玩。”小米儿看了看我那没有表情的面孔，她似乎已经完全明白，像安慰自己，也像向人解释，头一点一点地说：“爸爸要开刀。”说完又忙将头贴到我的胸口；我难受，可是依然是没有一点表情。
    小米儿平时上托儿所，只有星期天她才在家吃饭，我刚端起碗来，工友送来了病历牌，是内科的紧急会诊，我只得吞下吃在嘴里的半口饭，碗筷一放就走。
    午后计划小睡片刻，然后赶完上级催交的材料，可是偏偏邮电医院有一个胎盘滞留的产妇需要会诊。会诊回来，去病房看看几个重点病人，开完“医嘱”，已经是傍晚了。打从二门经过，手术室的刘同志问我今天忙不忙，我说：“还好，不算忙”。因为今天还没有需要动手术的急诊病人。
    晚饭时候，穿过热闹的中山路，看见多少倦游归来的车辆和人群，我欣羡他们的愉快和幸福，心里默默祝祷，下星期天可千万让我带小米儿去一次玄武湖吧，免得她再说：“爸爸要开刀”！
