Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: Horticultural scientists at the Central China Agricultural Science Institute have successfully grown apple trees at the East Lake Orchard Experiment Station in Wuchang, harvesting over 500 jin of apples.

These apples are large, with the largest weighing ten liang, and are sweet and delicious.

The Wuhan area is located at the junction of north and south, with long periods of high temperatures in summer and low temperatures in winter. In the past, there was a saying that "apple trees cannot cross the Yangtze River," and some scientists had tried planting them without success. After studying Michurin's theory, horticultural workers at the Central China Agricultural Science Institute began trial planting apple trees in 1951. They introduced some famous apple tree varieties from various parts of the north and planted them on a barren hillside near East Lake in Wuchang. Over the past five years, they have used scientific methods to manage the orchard, artificially cultivating and domesticating the apple trees, enabling them to adapt to the special climatic conditions of the Wuhan area. At the same time, they have continuously eliminated fruit tree diseases, allowing the apple trees to grow vigorously.

    武汉地区试种苹果成功
    据新华社武汉电　华中农业科学研究所的园艺科学工作者在武昌东湖果树试验场试种的苹果树已经成熟，收摘了五百多斤苹果。
    这种苹果果实硕大，最大的一个有十两重，香甜可口。
    武汉地区处在南北交接的地方，夏季高温时期和冬季低温时期较长，过去曾流传着“苹果树不能过长江”的说法，也有科学工作者曾经试种而失败过。华中农业科学研究所的园艺工作者在学习米丘林学说后，从1951年开始试种苹果树。他们从北方各地引进了一些著名的苹果树品种，栽植在武昌东湖附近一块荒野的丘岭上。五年来，他们运用科学方法管理果园，对苹果树进行了人工培育和驯服工作，使它们能够适应武汉地区特殊的气候条件。同时并不断地清除果树病害，使苹果树茁壮地成长起来。
