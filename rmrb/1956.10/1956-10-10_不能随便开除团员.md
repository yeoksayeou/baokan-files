    Members Cannot Be Expelled Arbitrarily

　　Editor:
    The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League once stipulated that the expulsion of a member must go through discussion by the League branch committee, be approved by the branch general meeting, decided by the League district committee, and approved by the League county committee before it can be implemented. However, some rural Party members and township cadres privately expelled League members from the League. In March of this year, we accepted the appeal of Liu Chengyi, a member of the Communist Youth League in Wuzhuang, Taitousi District, Dexian County, Shandong Province. After investigation by the Communist Youth League Dexian County Committee, it was confirmed that because he actively fought against the illegal activities of Party member cadres in his village, the village cadres fabricated false facts against him. The township cadres listened to only one side of the story and, without going through organizational procedures, privately announced his expulsion from the League. This situation also occurred in the Kōngjiā Hui Autonomous County of Wēnyuán, Qinghai Province. Zhu Shengfu, the secretary of the League branch in Kōngjiā Township in the third district of this county, had criticized a League member surnamed Ma several times, and this League member held a grudge. He fabricated that Zhu Shengfu was not active in the establishment of the cooperative and was hoarding study materials. Sòng Yuánhé, the director of the agricultural cooperative, and Mǎ Qǐyīng and Zhào Fúquán, the deputy directors (all Communist Party members, not holding positions in the League), without investigation or research, lightly believed the situation reflected by this League member. Without suggesting that the League organization study this issue, nor properly verifying the facts, they arbitrarily expelled Zhu Shengfu from the League in January of this year.
    This practice of arbitrarily punishing or even expelling League members without going through the discussion and approval of the League organization is wrong, and the relevant Party organizations should correct it. Furthermore, Party members and cadres should be educated that even if a League member makes a mistake and must be subjected to internal League discipline, Party members and cadres should report the situation and make suggestions to the League organization in the unit where the person who made the mistake is located, so that the League organization can handle it in accordance with organizational principles.　Zhao Fahai

    不能随便开除团员
　　编辑同志：
    青年团中央委员会曾规定开除团员必须经过团支部委员会讨论，支部大会通过，团区委决定，团县委的批准，才得执行。但是有些农村党员和乡干部却私自开除团员的团籍。今年3月我们受理了山东德县抬头寺区武庄青年团员刘成义的申诉，经青年团德县县委调查，证实由于他积极向本村党员干部的违法行为进行斗争，本村干部就给他捏造错误事实，乡干部偏听偏信，不经组织手续私自宣布开除了他的团籍。这种情况在青海省亹源回族自治县也曾发生。这个县的第三区孔家乡团支部书记朱生福，因为曾经对一个姓马的团员批评过几次，这个团员就怀恨在心，捏造他在建社中表现不积极和积压学习材料等。农业社的社长宋元和，副社长马启英、赵福全（都是共产党员，不担任团内工作），不加调查研究，就轻信了这个团员所反映的情况，既没有建议团组织研究这个问题，也没有很好地对证事实，就自作主张在今年1月开除了朱生福的团籍。
    这种不经过团的组织讨论、批准，任意处分团员甚至开除团员的做法，是错误的，有关党组织应该进行纠正。并且要教育党员、干部，即使团员犯了错误，必须受到团内的处分时，党员、干部也应该向犯错误者所在单位的团组织反映情况和提出建议，由团组织按照组织原则去处理。　赵法海
