    Two Electronic Heating Machines
    The Shanghai Public-Private Joint Venture Hongyin Wireless Equipment Factory has recently manufactured a high-frequency electronic heating machine and an ultra-high-frequency electronic heating machine. The high-frequency electronic heating machine emits a current of 30 to 40 kilocycles per second. It can be used to rapidly and evenly quench precision parts. When manufacturing radio vacuum tubes, heating the internal parts of the vacuum tube with this heating machine can make the vacuum tube extract air more cleanly. Four identical heating machines are now in production.
    The ultra-high-frequency electronic heating machine manufactured by this factory can emit an ultra-high-frequency current of 20 to 30 megacycles per second. It can cause insulators such as plastics to heat internally under the influence of radio waves. Using this characteristic can greatly improve the quality of glue and electrical insulation products, and manufacture high-grade insulating parts. This heating machine is equipped with equipment to ensure the safety of workers. As long as the small doors or drawers around the machine are opened, the high-frequency and high-voltage current inside the machine will be automatically switched off, and workers will not be in danger of encountering high-frequency, high-voltage current during operation.

    Sino-Soviet Friendship Coupler
    A batch of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Couplers" manufactured by the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has recently been used on the Ji'er Railway international through trains.
    This "Sino-Soviet Friendship Coupler" is specifically used to connect Chinese and Soviet vehicles. In the past, when connecting Chinese and Soviet vehicles, because the height of the Chinese vehicle couplers and the height of the Soviet vehicle couplers were different, it was necessary to hang a connecting car in the middle, with one end being a Soviet-style coupler and the other end being a Chinese-style coupler. This wasted both vehicles and time. Sometimes, because there were not enough connecting cars, it was necessary to connect by dismantling and replacing the couplers, which was very troublesome. Now, as long as the Chinese coupler tongue is removed and the hook tongue of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Coupler" is replaced, the two types of vehicles can be connected together.
    The model of this "Sino-Soviet Friendship Coupler" was exhibited at the International Passenger and Freight Car Technical Cooperation Conference held in Poland in May this year, and was enthusiastically praised by representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland and other countries.

    两种电子电热机
    上海公私合营宏音无线电器材厂最近已制成一台高频电子电热机和一台超高频电子电热机。高频电子电热机每秒钟发出三十到四十千周高频的电流，利用它可以迅速均匀地对精密零件进行淬火加工，在制造无线电真空管时利用这台电热机对真空管内部的零件加热，也可以使真空管抽气时气抽得更为干净。现在同样的四台电热机，已投入生产。
    这个厂制造的超高频电子电热机，每秒钟可以发出二十到三十兆周超高频的电流，它可以使塑胶等绝缘体受到电波的影响而内部发热，利用这种特性可以大大提高胶水电气绝缘产品的质量，制造高级的绝缘件。这台电热机安装有保证工人安全操作的设备，只要机器周围的小门或抽屉被打开，机器里面高频和高压的电流就会被自动开关切断，工人操作时不会因碰上高频、高压的电流而发生危险。（新华社）
    中苏友好车钩
    戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂制造的一批“中苏友好车钩”，最近已在集二线国际联运列车上使用。
    这种“中苏友好车钩”是专门用来连接中国车辆和苏联车辆的。过去，中苏车辆在连接时，因为中国车辆的车钩高度和苏联车辆的车钩高度不同，必须把一种一端是苏联式的车钩，另一端是中国式的车钩的连接车挂在中间。这样，既浪费车辆又费时间，有时因连接车不够用，只得用大拆大卸更换车钩的办法连接，十分麻烦。现在，只要将中国车钩舌卸下，再将“中苏友好车钩”的钩舌换上，即可将两种车辆连接在一起。
    这种“中苏友好车钩”的模型，今年五月间曾在波兰召开的国际客货车技术协作会上展览，受到苏联、波兰等国代表的热烈称赞。
