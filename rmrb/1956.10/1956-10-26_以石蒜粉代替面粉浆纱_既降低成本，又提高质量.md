Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 24th. Since mid-October, thirty hand-operated sizing factories and some weaving factories in Tianjin have been mixing two-thirds lycoris radiata powder into their sizing materials to replace wheat flour for sizing yarn. It is estimated that more than 170,000 jin of wheat flour can be saved in the fourth quarter of this year. The cost of sizing yarn will be reduced by 5.4% compared to using wheat flour.

Lycoris radiata is a wild plant that contains a lot of soluble starch, which easily penetrates into the fibers of the yarn. Lycoris radiata powder also has antiseptic properties. The sized yarn has high strength, does not stick together, and is not prone to breakage during weaving. In the past, using wheat flour for sizing yarn often affected the quality of the sizing due to fermentation on cloudy days. This problem can be reduced after mixing in lycoris radiata powder.

    以石蒜粉代替面粉浆纱
    既降低成本，又提高质量
    新华社天津24日电　天津市的三十个手工浆纱厂和一部分织布厂，从10月中旬起在浆料中掺用三分之二的石蒜粉代替面粉浆纱，预计在今年第四季度中可以节约面粉十七万多斤；浆纱成本比用面粉将降低5.4％。
    石蒜是一种野生植物，含有很多可溶性淀粉，容易渗透到纱的纤维中去。石蒜粉还有防腐性，浆出来的纱强力大，不会粘在一起，织布时不容易断头。过去用面粉浆纱在阴天时因发酵往往影响浆纱质量，掺用石蒜粉后这种毛病可以减少。
