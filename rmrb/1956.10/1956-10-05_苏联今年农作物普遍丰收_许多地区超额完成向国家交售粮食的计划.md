Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 4th: Good news of bumper harvests is constantly pouring in from all over the Soviet Union, and the grain harvesting work is coming to an end soon. According to statistics up to September 30, collective farms and state farms across the Soviet Union have completed 94.8% to 97.8% of their grain harvesting plans, respectively.

Currently, many places have fulfilled and overfulfilled their grain sales plans to the state ahead of schedule.

The collective farms and state farms of the Bashkir Autonomous Republic have delivered 80 million poods (one pood equals 32.76 jin) of grain to the state ahead of schedule, almost doubling last year's amount. This year, the Bashkir Autonomous Republic harvested an average of 100 or more poods of grain per hectare on newly cultivated land. Although the sales plan has been completed, the work of selling grain is still in progress.

The collective farms and state farms of the Kazakh Republic have delivered 900.95 million poods of grain to the state, not far from the target of selling 1 billion poods of grain.

By September 27, the Kustanai Region of the Kazakh Republic had delivered 262.8 million poods of grain ahead of schedule, exceeding the original plan by 127 million poods, which is 12.12 million poods more than the total grain delivered in the past 22 years. State farms established on newly cultivated land have played a huge role in increasing grain production. The Kustanai Region has cultivated a total of 4 million hectares of new land, and this year the grain sown area has been expanded to 4.5 million hectares, four times more than in 1953; ninety-four new large-scale state farms have been established, and many farms harvest 100 to 120 poods of grain per hectare. The Sudlov State Farm harvests an average of 133 poods of grain per hectare. The state farms and collective farms in this region are preparing to sell another 20 million poods of grain to the state. The Akmolinsk Region of the Republic had delivered 175 million poods of grain by September 23, exceeding the sales plan by 50 million poods, and selling 154 million poods more than before the reclamation of wasteland in 1953.

The collective farms and state farms in Turkmenistan, Armenia, Georgia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Moldova and other places have also completed their grain sales plans ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, October 4th: According to TASS reports: Along with the unprecedented bumper harvest of grain, the Soviet Union's sugar beets, flax, vegetables, potatoes and other crops have also achieved good harvests this year.

This year, the total output of sugar beets in the Soviet Union has increased greatly. It is estimated that collective farms alone will increase by 50 to 60 million centners compared to last year. Many advanced collective farms and state farms have harvested 300 to 400 centners of sugar beets per hectare this year. The harvest of flax in various places is also very good.

In terms of vegetable and potato production, this year most state farms have doubled or tripled the potato yield per hectare compared to last year. The late vegetables harvested by state farms have increased by one and a half times compared to last year. The collective farms also have a very good harvest of these two crops.

    苏联今年农作物普遍丰收
    许多地区超额完成向国家交售粮食的计划
    本报莫斯科4日电　苏联各地丰收的捷报不断传出，谷物收获工作很快就要结束了。据到9月30日为止的统计，苏联全国的集体农庄和国营农场已经分别完成谷物收割计划的94.8％到97.8％。
    目前，许多地方已提前和超额完成向国家交售粮食的计划。
    巴什基尔自治共和国的集体农庄和国营农场已经提前交售给国家八千万普特（每普特合三十二点七六市斤）粮食，几乎比去年增加一倍。今年在巴什基尔自治共和国的新地上平均每公顷收获一百或一百多普特粮食。虽然交售计划已经完成了，但交售粮食的工作还在继续进行。
    哈萨克共和国的集体农庄和国营农场已经交售九亿零九百五十万普特粮食给国家，离十亿普特的交售粮食目标已经不远了。
    哈萨克共和国的库斯坦奈州到9月27日止，已经提前交售了二亿六千二百八十万普特，比原定计划超出一亿二千七百万普特，比近二十二年期间总共交售的粮食还多一千二百万普特。在新地上建立的国营农场对增加粮食生产起了巨大作用。库斯坦奈州一共开垦了四百万公顷的新地，今年谷物播种面积扩大到四百五十万公顷，比1953年多四倍；建立了九十四个新的大型国营农场，许多农场每公顷都打一百到一百二十普特粮食。在苏德洛夫国营农场平均每公顷打一百三十三普特粮食。这个州的国营农场和集体农庄准备再多交售二千万普特粮食给国家。共和国的阿克摩林斯克州在9月23日已交售了一亿七千五百万普特粮食，超过交售计划五千万普特，比1953年开垦荒地以前多交售一亿五千四百万普特。
    土库曼、亚美尼亚、格鲁吉亚、塔吉克、吉尔吉斯、阿塞拜疆、摩尔达维亚等地的集体农庄和国营农场也提前完成了交售粮食的计划。
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社报道：和谷物空前丰收的同时，今年苏联的甜菜、亚麻、蔬菜、马铃薯等农作物也获得了很好的收成。
    今年苏联全国的甜菜总产量增加得很多。据估计单是集体农庄就将比去年增加五千万到六千万公担。有许多先进的集体农庄和国营农场今年从每公顷土地上收获了三百到四百公担甜菜。各地亚麻的收成也很好。
    在蔬菜和马铃薯生产方面，今年大多数国营农场每公顷土地的马铃薯单位面积产量比去年高一倍到两倍。国营农场收获的晚蔬菜增加为去年的一倍半。集体农庄的这两种作物的收成也很好。
