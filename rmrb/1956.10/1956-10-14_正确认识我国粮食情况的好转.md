    According to statistics from the Ministry of Food: In the third quarter of this year, grain sales increased by 4.3 billion jin compared to the same period in 1955, and even exceeded the same period in 1954, which suffered a major disaster, by 1.6 billion jin. Moreover, the increased sales figures are rising month by month. Although some of the increased grain sales are necessary and reasonable, the remaining increased sales exceed the limit of what China's current grain supply can actually sustain, and are therefore unreasonable and abnormal. At the same time, since the summer grain purchase work began this year, the amount of grain purchased by the state has decreased by 2 to 3 billion jin compared to the same period last year, which is also a noteworthy phenomenon. Obviously, if we allow this trend of unreasonable increase in sales and unreasonable decrease in purchases to continue, it will be impossible to effectively guarantee the necessary grain supply in all aspects. Then, the grain disturbances that occurred after September 1954 and before May 1955 may reoccur. This must be resolutely prevented.
    There are many reasons for the above situation. Fundamentally, the main reason is that many comrades have an overly optimistic view when estimating China's current grain situation.
    Undoubtedly, since the second half of 1955, China's grain purchase and sales situation has improved significantly, and the situation of the state's unified purchase and sale of grain has been further stabilized. We will make mistakes in our work if we cannot see or do not acknowledge this favorable situation. However, we must understand under what conditions such a major victory was achieved. It should be said that this is determined by two basic conditions. On the one hand, the rapid development of the socialist upsurge in rural areas has ensured the smooth implementation of the state's various measures in terms of unified purchase and sale of grain. At the same time, the bumper agricultural harvest in 1955 also played an important role in stabilizing China's grain situation. On the other hand, the Party and the government resolutely rectified the unified grain sales work in urban and rural areas, and implemented measures for fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales of grain in rural areas, and quantitative supply of grain in towns and cities. This strictly controlled the state's purchase quantity within the policy limits, and resolutely compressed unreasonable grain sales, thereby not only stabilizing and improving farmers' production enthusiasm, promoting the development of agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production, but also effectively ensuring the necessary grain supply in all aspects. Both conditions are the result of the great efforts made by the entire Party, with high attention and concentrated strength, working hard and meticulously.
    To continue to stabilize China's grain purchase and sales situation, it is necessary to continue to consolidate these two basic conditions. The key to consolidating them lies in the Party's leadership and the importance attached to it by the entire Party. It must be recognized that it is precisely under the condition of adhering to and implementing the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain that the smooth development of agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production is guaranteed, and the stability of the grain situation is maintained on the basis of grain production and demand balance and purchase and sales balance. Only under the conditions of continuous consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives and continuous increase in grain production can the smooth progress of China's unified purchase and sale of grain be guaranteed, and the gradual solution of China's grain problem obtain the necessary material basis. Therefore, in a considerably long period, to continue to ensure the stability and consolidation of the grain situation, and to smoothly and effectively solve China's grain problem, it is necessary to continue to strengthen and develop these two basic conditions. The lack or weakening of any aspect will have unfavorable consequences. However, under certain circumstances, such as the current situation where grain production is not increasing much and objective needs are increasing greatly, it is even more necessary for the entire Party to attach importance to ensuring that no problems arise in grain work by strengthening the unified purchase and sale of grain, thereby ensuring the smooth progress of national construction and the smooth development of the agricultural economy. In this regard, effectively controlling grain sales at a reasonable level remains a decisive link. This is a basic experience in solving China's grain problem in the past two or three years.
    Currently, many comrades do not understand China's current grain problem in this way. They only see or see too much of the favorable conditions, and do not see or underestimate the unfavorable conditions; they only see that the agricultural economy has been cooperativized and the prospects for increased grain production are greater, and that the grain situation will definitely be further stabilized in the future (which is certainly correct), but they do not see that China's basic grain situation is still insufficient production and a large increase in objective needs, and they do not see that the concepts of small producers and small private owners among farmers still need to be gradually changed through long-term persuasion and education even after agricultural cooperativization; they only see that certain old problems and old contradictions have been solved, but they do not see that new problems and new contradictions are arising. Therefore, they believe that China's grain problem seems to have been fundamentally solved, and that it is not necessary to pay attention to or grasp the work of unified purchase and sale of grain, and that grain sales can be uncontrolled. Under these circumstances, a phenomenon of slackening in grain purchase and sales work has occurred in the country. This is the crux of the recent unreasonable increase in grain sales, poor purchase situation, and continuous reduction of purchase differences in many places.
    All Party comrades, all state workers, and the people of the whole country should clearly recognize that although China's current grain situation has definitely improved, it does not mean that we can sit back and relax from now on, and we must still maintain a high degree of vigilance at all times. We are fully confident in continuing to maintain and consolidate the stability of the grain situation; however, at present, this can only be done more correctly and more effectively by adhering to and implementing the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain throughout the country.
    It must be made clear to the entire Party and the people of the whole country that a fundamental requirement for adhering to the unified purchase and sale of grain is to effectively ensure a reasonable balance between the state's grain income and expenditure within a grain year, on the basis of maintaining a balance between production and needs. That is to say, it is necessary to reasonably stipulate the state's grain purchase quantity under the possible conditions of grain production, and to strictly ensure the necessary and reasonable grain supply in all aspects within the quantity of grain purchased by the state. This balance can be that the state has more grain surplus beyond the offset of income and expenditure, or that the state has less grain accumulated beyond the offset of income and expenditure, or basically no surplus. This depends on the specific production situation and the needs situation of the year. However, in any case, it is necessary to do everything possible to ensure that the state's grain expenditure does not exceed the income quantity. To achieve this goal, the state must use the lever of unified purchase and sale to adjust the state's grain income and expenditure at any time. In this regard, the production situation and the needs situation are changing every year, and the scale mastered by the state in the unified purchase and sale of grain should also adapt to this change at any time. It can be seen from this that to maintain the continued stability of the grain situation, it is necessary to always pay attention to the balance of grain income and expenditure, and to quickly solve the problem as soon as it occurs. This is a principle that must be strictly observed when deciding on various measures for grain work.
    Now the trend of unreasonable increase in grain sales has not stopped, and the national winter grain purchase and sales work is about to be fully launched. Local Party committees should explain the current grain problem in China to the entire Party, so that all Party comrades have a clear concept of the development of the grain situation. At the same time, an inspection of the grain supply work should be carried out immediately, and effective measures should be taken to seriously control grain sales from October this year to February next year, in order to effectively ensure the grain supply in the rural grain shortage season from March to June next year; it is also necessary to organize and concentrate the necessary forces under the unified deployment and personal leadership of Party committees at all levels, to allocate a period of time, in conjunction with winter cultivation production and autumn harvest distribution of agricultural cooperatives, to fully carry out political and ideological education work, and to do a good job in this winter's grain purchase and sales work.

### 正确认识我国粮食情况的好转

    正确认识我国粮食情况的好转
    据粮食部统计：今年第三季度粮食销售量比1955年同期增加了四十三亿斤，比遭受特大灾荒的1954年同期还多十六亿斤；而且增销的数字还是逐月上升的。在增销的粮食里面，虽然有一部分是必需的和合理的增销，但是其余增销的部分却超过了我国当前粮食实际上可能增销的限度，是不合理的和不正常的。同时，在进行今年夏季粮食征购工作以来，国家征购的粮食反而比去年同期减少了二、三十亿斤，这也是一种值得注意的现象。很明显，如果我们允许这种销售量不合理增加和征购数量不合理减少的趋势继续发展，就不可能切实保证各方面必不可少的粮食供应；那末，像1954年9月以后、1955年5月以前曾经发生的粮食风波就有可能重新再起。这是必须坚决防止的。
    造成上述情况的原因很多。从根本上讲来，主要原因还是许多同志在估计我国当前粮食现状的时候，有过分乐观的看法。
    毫无疑问，1955年下半年以来，我国粮食购销情况有了显著的好转，国家粮食统购统销的局势有了进一步的稳定。看不到或者不承认这种有利的局面，我们就要在工作中犯错误。但是，我们必须明了，究竟是在什么样的条件下，才得到了如此重大的胜利。应该说，这是由两方面的基本条件决定的。一方面，农村社会主义高潮的迅速发展，保证了国家在粮食统购统销方面的各项措施得以顺利地贯彻执行；同时，1955年农业的大丰收，对我国粮食局势的稳定，也起了重要的作用。另一方面，党和政府坚决整顿了城乡粮食统销工作，实行了农村粮食定产、定购、定销和市镇粮食定量供应的措施，它把国家的征购数量严格控制在政策的界限以内，并且把不合理的粮食销量坚决地压缩下来，从而不但安定了和提高了农民的生产情绪，促进了农业合作化和农业生产的发展，而且切实保证了各方面必需的粮食供应。两方面的条件，又都是全党高度重视和集中力量艰苦地细致地进行了巨大工作的结果。
    要继续稳定我国粮食购销局势，必须继续巩固这两方面的基本条件。巩固它们的关键，在于党的领导和全党重视。必须认识，正是在坚持贯彻执行粮食统购统销政策的条件下，才保证了农业合作化和农业生产的顺利发展，保证了在粮食产需平衡、购销平衡的基础上保持粮食局势的稳定；也只有在农业生产合作社不断巩固、发展和粮食产量不断增加的条件下，才能保证我国粮食统购统销的顺利进行，使我国粮食问题的逐步解决获得必要的物质基础。因此在一个相当长的时期内，要继续保证粮食局势的稳定和巩固，要顺利地有效地解决我国的粮食问题，必须继续加强和发展这两个方面的基本条件，缺少或者削弱了任何一个方面，都会发生不利的后果。不过，在一定的情况下，比如在目前粮食增产不多、客观需要又增加很大的情况下，就更加需要全党重视从加强粮食统购统销方面来保证在粮食工作上不出乱子，从而保证国家建设的顺利进行和农业经济的顺利发展。在这方面，把粮食销量切实控制在合理的水平上，仍然是一个决定性的环节。这是两、三年来解决我国粮食问题的一条基本的经验。　
    目前，有不少同志并不是这样来理解我国当前的粮食问题的。他们只看到或者过多地看到有利的条件，而看不到或者看轻了不利的条件；只看到农业经济合作化了，粮食增产的前途更大了，以后粮食局势一定会进一步稳定（这当然是对的），而看不到目前我国粮食的基本情况仍然是生产不足和客观需要大量增加，看不到农民的小生产者小私有者的观念即使在农业合作化以后也还需要经过长期说服教育才能逐步改变；只看到某些旧的问题和老的矛盾得到了解决，而看不到新的问题和新的矛盾正在发生。因此，他们认为我国粮食问题似乎从此已经根本解决了，对于粮食统购统销工作可以不必重视不必抓紧了，粮食的销量也可以不加控制了。在这种情况下，目前在全国发生了一种在粮食购销工作方面松劲的现象。这就是近来不少地方粮食销量不合理增加、征购情况不很好、收购差额不断缩小的症结所在。
    全党同志、全体国家工作人员和全国人民应当明确地认识到：我国目前的粮食局势虽然有了肯定的好转，但绝不是说从此可以高枕无忧了，我们仍然必须随时保持高度的警惕。我们完全有信心继续保持和巩固粮食局势的稳定；但是，目前只有在全国范围内坚持贯彻执行粮食统购统销政策的条件下，才可能更正确地和更加有效地做到这一点。
    必须使全党和全国人民懂得：坚持实行粮食统购统销的一个根本要求，是在生产同需要保持平衡的基础上，切实保证国家在一个粮食年度内的粮食收入同支出得到合理的平衡。这就是说，既要在粮食生产可能的条件下合理地规定国家的粮食征购数量，又要严格地在国家征购到的粮食数量内切实保证各方面必不可少的合理的粮食供应。这种平衡，可以是收支抵销以外国家有较多的粮食积余，也可以是收支抵销以外国家积累的粮食较少、或者大体上没有积余。这要看当年具体的生产情况和需要情况如何来确定。但是，无论如何，必须尽一切可能保证国家的粮食支出数量不超过收入数量。要达到这个目的，国家必须运用统购统销这个杠杆来随时调节国家的粮食收支。在这方面，每年的生产情况和需要情况都在变化，国家在粮食统购统销方面掌握的尺度也应该随时适应这种变化。由此可见，要保持粮食局势的继续稳定，就必须经常关心粮食收支平衡的情况，一当发生问题就迅速地解决。这是在决定粮食工作的各项措施的时候，必须严格遵守的一个原则。
    现在粮食销量不合理增加的趋势尚未停止，全国冬季粮食统购统销工作正待全面展开。各地党委应该向全党说明我国目前粮食问题的情况，使全党同志对粮食局势的发展有一个清晰的概念。同时，应该立即对粮食供应工作进行一次检查，并且采取有效的措施，认真地把今年10月至明年2月的粮食销量控制起来，以便切实保证明年3月至6月农村缺粮季节的粮食供应；还要在各级党委的统一部署和亲自领导下，组织和集中必要的力量，划出一段时间，结合冬耕生产和农业社秋收分配，充分进行政治思想教育工作，把今年冬季的粮食统购统销工作做好。
