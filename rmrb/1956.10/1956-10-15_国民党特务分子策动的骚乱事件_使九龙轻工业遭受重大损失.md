Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 14th: Hong Kong Dispatch: The Kowloon riot instigated by Kuomintang secret agents has caused incalculable losses to light industry in Kowloon and its suburbs. According to preliminary statistics, no fewer than 1,000 factories, large and small, are currently shut down due to the riots. Some factories suffered fire damage and destruction of equipment and sites by rioters, and the amount of losses cannot be estimated for the time being. The daily losses due to production stoppages alone amount to several million dollars. Taking textile factories as an example, approximately 750 bundles of yarn are produced daily, with a value of over one million dollars. These yarn factories have been unable to resume operations since the riots.

The factories in the Tsuen Wan district suffered the most severe losses. This area is a suburban area with a relatively high concentration of light industry. After suffering this devastation, the machines in the factories in Tsuen Wan district were damaged, and the factory owners believe that it will be difficult to restore normal production in the short term. In addition, the large and small factories in the Sham Shui Po district of Kowloon and the Kowloon urban area have also suffered heavy losses due to the destruction and arson by rioters. The Kowloon Factory of the Gardon Biscuit and Bread Company on Castle Peak Road in Sham Shui Po was set on fire by rioters on the 11th, causing serious damage to the factory building and machinery and equipment. According to preliminary estimates by the factory, the losses amounted to approximately five million dollars.

    国民党特务分子策动的骚乱事件
    使九龙轻工业遭受重大损失
    新华社广州14日电　香港消息：国民党特务分子策动的九龙骚乱事件，使九龙城区和郊区的轻工业遭受到无可估量的损失。据初步调查统计，目前因受到骚乱影响而仍处在停顿状态中的有不下一千家的大小工厂，其中有若干工厂因为设备和厂址遭暴徒放火焚烧破坏，损失数字一时尚无法估计，仅因生产停顿，每日所受损失也达到数百万元。以纺织工厂为例，每日出纱约有七百五十捆，其价值即在一百万元以上，这些纱厂在骚乱事件发生以来，迄今仍无法开工。
    损失最惨重的是荃湾区的工厂，这个地区是轻工业较为集中的郊区。荃湾区的工厂经受这次摧残，机器损坏，工厂主事人认为短期内难以恢复正常生产。又由于九龙深水埗区和九龙城区的大小工厂，都因为遭受暴徒的捣毁、放火，损失也很惨重。嘉顿饼干面包公司在深水埗青山道的工厂，11日被暴徒纵火毁烧，厂房机器设备损失严重，据厂方初步估计，损失达五百万元左右。
