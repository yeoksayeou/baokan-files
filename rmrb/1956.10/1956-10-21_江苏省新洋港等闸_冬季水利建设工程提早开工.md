Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 18th: Winter water conservancy construction projects in coastal Jiangsu Province, such as the Xinyang Port Sluice Gate, the Jiao Port Sluice Gate in Rugao County, the Shaoxiang River Sluice Gate in Guanyun County, and the Yao Sluice Gate in Funing County, have already started early. Many other projects are also actively preparing to commence. More than 20,000 tons of materials needed for water conservancy construction projects throughout the province have been transported to the construction sites. Civilian laborers are also departing for the construction sites in succession.

This winter, Jiangsu Province's water conservancy construction projects are expected to involve 89 million cubic meters of earthwork, more than double that of the same period last year. During the preparation period, the Provincial Water Conservancy Department, based on the opinions raised by some representatives at the Fourth Provincial People's Congress and the Provincial Water Conservancy Work Conference, revised the originally formulated water conservancy construction plan. The revisions mainly involved postponing projects that could be delayed, and adding 31 urgently needed construction projects, in order to concentrate efforts and better utilize funds and materials. According to the revised plan, 176 water conservancy projects throughout the province will be completed successively this winter or before the flood season next year. Preliminary calculations indicate that this will increase drainage and irrigation areas by approximately 11 million mu.

    江苏省新洋港等闸
    冬季水利建设工程提早开工
    新华社南京18日电　江苏省沿海的新洋港闸、如皋县的焦港闸、灌云县的烧香河闸、阜宁县的腰闸等冬季水利建设工程已经提早开工。其他许多工程正在积极准备开工。全省水利建设工程所需的器材，已经有二万多吨运到工地。民工也陆续向工地出发。
    今年冬季，江苏省水利建设工程预计要做八千九百万土方，超过去年同期一倍多。在准备工作期间，省水利厅根据第四次省人民代表大会上和全省水利工作会议上有些代表提出的意见，把原来制定的水利施工计划作了修改。修改的部分，主要是可以缓办的工程暂时缓办，另外增添了三十一项急需修建的项目，以便集中力量，更好地使用资金和器材。按照修改后的计划，全省一百七十六项水利工程将在今年冬季或明年汛期前先后完成，初步计算可以增加排涝、灌溉面积约一千一百万亩左右。
