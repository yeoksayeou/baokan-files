    Shanghai Snacks
    Shen Chunsheng
    When it comes to food and drink, people naturally think of authentic famous dishes from various regions, but I remember Shanghai snacks.
    During those years living in Shanghai, I discovered that snacks were an indispensable embellishment to life. Every time the night was still and quiet, rhythmic cries echoed from the alleys, mixed with the clacking sound of bamboo clappers. The first time, I didn't understand, but listening carefully, the cries were for "Osmanthus White Sugar Glutinous Rice Cake," "Ham Zongzi"..., the clacking sound was the sign of wonton and plain noodle vendors. Later, I would wait for the sounds, stop working, get up, and call out from the window. There was no need to go downstairs; I could lower a basket from the window, and a bowl of hot noodles or snacks would be lifted up. After eating, I would put the money in the empty bowl, lower it back down, and say "See you tomorrow night," before turning off the light and going to bed with peace of mind. Sometimes, returning home from a night show, the streets were deserted, but a bright light and rising steam could be seen at a street corner, where people were huddled together. There would definitely be a late-night snack stall there. I would immediately quicken my pace to squeeze in, warm myself, and eat a bowl, feeling that the night had not been wasted. Sometimes, finishing work late at night, it was just dawn. The streets were already filled with various snack stalls offering breakfast, with freshly cooked and steamed xiaolongbao and tangyuan, their aroma wafting in the air. I would inevitably sit down to eat a serving, and then drink a bowl of soy milk, before returning home to sleep, completely satisfied.
    It has been seven years since I left Shanghai for Beijing, and these scenes are still vivid in my mind. When I first came to Beijing, I couldn't enjoy the Shanghai snacks, and I felt a bit of a deficiency. Later, I found that most people who came from Shanghai initially felt the same way. In the mornings, on the tram or in the office, I would often hear people with Shanghai accents exclaiming: "Beijing breakfasts are so monotonous, not as good as Shanghai at all!" You could tell that the speaker was newly arrived from Shanghai.
    In fact, Beijing also has many local snacks, but Shanghainese people are not accustomed to them at first. But it cannot be denied that Shanghainese people are more particular about eating and drinking. They don't all love extravagant feasts; most still prefer affordable snacks. Therefore, Shanghai snacks arose in response to the times and have flourished. Shanghai not only has numerous snack stalls scattered throughout the city, but also many snack shops with "Economic Snacks" and "Delicious Snacks" advertisements. Even the most upscale restaurants often have snack sections. I am grateful to the workers in the snack industry. They are diligent and quick, supplying food almost non-stop, twenty-four hours a day, and constantly working to improve and innovate. The content of Shanghai snacks is extremely rich and varied, mostly various kinds of dry, wet, sweet, and savory snacks made to order, covering frying, deep-frying, blanching, stir-frying, boiling, stewing..., everything is available, and most are excellent in color, aroma, and taste. It is impossible to list all the names and descriptions here, but I can summarize them in seven characters: delicious, affordable, and for the masses. They are not as overly greasy and filling as formal meals of delicacies from land and sea, nor are they as likely to spoil the appetite as sweets and snacks. However, they can be used as a main meal to fill the stomach, or as a snack to satisfy cravings. How could they not be popular?
    Some time ago, I heard that Shanghai service industry workers were migrating to various parts of the country along with Shanghai construction talent, and I was very happy, hoping that a batch of culinary talent would soon come to the capital. Sure enough, on October 6th, the Beijing Daily had a prominent headline: "Large Numbers of Chefs from Shanghai and Guangzhou Arrive in Beijing, the Capital Will Add a Batch of Southern Food Stores." Recently, I learned that the "State-Operated Shanghai Snack Shop" had already opened, located in Bameicao, so I happily went there. Ah! Long time no see, pan-fried buns! Long time no see, Cifantuan! Long time no see, salty soy milk! Long time no see,... As I devoured the snacks, I looked around and saw that the place was full of fellow "Ala" Shanghainese, making me feel particularly close to home. Talking with the manager, I learned that this snack shop was formed by fourteen Shanghai snack stall chefs who came to Beijing. Now they not only offer breakfast, but also late-night snacks. Since its opening on National Day, it has been packed, and the actors from the Yue Opera currently performing in Beijing are regular customers. However, due to limited conditions, there are not many varieties of snacks available now, and the sanitary environment is a bit poor. They are studying improvements based on customer feedback.

### 上海小吃

    上海小吃
    申春生
    提起吃喝，人们自然而然会想到各地的正宗名菜，但我却记起上海的小吃。
    那些年住在上海，发现小吃也是生活中不可缺少的点缀。每当夜深人静，弄堂里传来了声声抑扬顿挫的叫喊，还夹杂着敲打竹梆的柝柝声，第一次不明究竟，仔细辨听，叫喊的是“桂花白糖糯米糕”、“火腿粽子”……，那柝柝声是卖馄饨和阳春面的标志。以后专等声音一起，就停止工作，起身开窗唤住，不必下楼，从窗口吊一只篮子下去，就能提上来一碗热腾腾的面或点心，吃了，空碗里放了钱吊下去送还，照例说声“明夜见”，然后心安理得地关灯上床。有时看夜戏回家，路上行人绝迹，但见街角灯火明亮，热气蒸腾，人们围成一团，那里必有夜宵小吃摊，顿时加快脚步前去挤一挤，暖一暖，吃一碗，才觉不虚此夜。有时做夜工作下班，正是晨曦初上时候，街上早已布满各式各样的小吃摊在那里供应早点了，小笼包子、汤圆……刚刚起锅，刚刚出笼，热气、香味扑鼻而来，于是少不得坐下来吃一客，再喝碗豆浆，才心满意足地回去睡觉。
    离开上海到北京七年了，回忆这些情景，还是历历在目。初来北京时，享受不到上海小吃的口腹，竟然有点美中不足的感觉。后来发现从上海来的人初时大都有同感。早晨上班，在电车里，在办公室里，往往听见上海话音的感叹：“北京早点真单调，远不如上海！”准知道说话的人新从上海来。
    其实，北京也有许多本地的小吃，只是上海人初时还吃不习惯罢了。但不能否认，上海人确是比较讲究吃喝，倒也不全爱大吃大喝，大多还是喜欢实惠小吃，因此上海小吃应时而生并且繁盛不衰。上海不仅有众多的小吃摊贩星罗棋布在全市，而且还有贴着“经济小吃”、“美味小吃”广告的许多小吃店，就是最高级的大饭铺，也往往辟有小吃部。感谢这些小吃行业的工人，他们殷勤而且敏快，几乎日夜二十四小时不停供应，又不断在内容的改进和创造上下功夫。上海小吃的内容是极其丰富多采的，大抵是随吃当时立做的各种各样干、湿、甜、咸点心，举凡煎、炸、氽、炒、煮、炖……，一应俱全，而且大都色、香、味三者俱佳，这里无法一一列举名称和加以描摹，可以七个字下断语：味美价廉大众化。它不同于山珍海味的正餐那样过度油腻涨饱，也有别于糖果零食那样容易败坏胃口，然而它既可当作正餐充饥，又可聊充零食解谗，怎么不受众人欢迎呢！
    前些时候听说上海的服务行业随着上海建设人才的到祖国各地而外迁各地，十分高兴，盼望快来首都一批饮食人才。果然，10月6日北京日报有个赫赫标题：“上海、广州大批厨师到京，首都将增加一批南方食品店”。最近访得“国营上海小吃店”已先开张，地址在八面糟，便欣然前往。呀！久违了，生煎馒头！久违了，粢饭团！久违了，咸豆浆！久违了，……。我一面大嚼，一面举目四望，但见满座“阿拉”同乡，倍觉亲切。和掌柜同志一谈，才知这小吃店是上海十四位小吃摊厨师来京组成的，现在不仅供应早点，还有夜宵。国庆日开张以来，座无虚席，正在北京上演的越剧的演员，是座上常客。不过限于条件，现在小吃品种还不多，卫生环境也差些，他们正根据吃客意见研究改进哩。
