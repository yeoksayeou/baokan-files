    Caring for the Lives of Workers in Many Ways
    Chen Shaomin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    Our Party and government have always been very concerned about the material and cultural lives of workers. The state's annual plans stipulate indicators for raising the wage levels of workers along with the growth of labor productivity. Although the growth of average wages of workers in various industrial sectors in 1955 lagged behind the growth of labor productivity, it increased by 14.7% compared to 1952. The average wage of workers nationwide in 1955 increased by 19.3% compared to 1952. In the past three years, the state has invested 122.55 million yuan solely to improve the working conditions of workers in state-owned factories and mines under the heavy industry, railways, first machinery, second machinery, and textile departments, with the textile industry, which employs a large number of female workers, accounting for 20.17 million yuan. Our country is increasing the construction of worker housing, nurseries, and health facilities every year. Sanatoriums, rest homes, cultural palaces, clubs, and other collective welfare facilities for workers were unheard of before liberation, but are now being built on a large scale. From all aspects, the material and cultural living standards of workers are improving year by year. The workers say, "We must not forget the well-diggers when we drink water," and "We must work hard in production and build socialism to repay the care of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."
    Of course, this is not to say that the lives of workers are already very good. In fact, there are still many problems in the lives of workers, and some workers still have difficulties in their lives. It should be pointed out here that we have only been building the country for seven years. Our Party has led the people of the whole country in arduous struggles, overcome the serious economic difficulties left over from the old society, overcome natural disasters, restored and developed the national economy, and started socialist construction, so that the material and cultural lives of workers have reached today's level. Now we have just begun to build socialism, and the problems in the lives of workers cannot be completely solved in a short period of time. However, if we make efforts in all aspects according to needs and possibilities, the difficulties in the lives of workers can be reduced somewhat. The problem is that there is bureaucracy in our work, so that some problems that can be solved at present have not been solved in time.
    The state allocates funds for increasing workers' wages every year, but because some factory and mine leaders do not care enough about the lives of workers, and the主管机关 (supervisory authorities) fail to supervise effectively, they do not adjust wages in time and use this part of the wage fund reasonably, but instead accumulate it, which makes the increase in wages and the improvement of labor productivity even more incompatible.
    The enterprise bonus fund is a large amount of money, but it has not played its due role. Some is used to build office buildings, some is used for repair costs, some is used for entertainment expenses, some is used to buy typewriters, some is deposited in the bank, etc., which makes the enterprise bonus fund lose its bonus meaning, so some people say: "The enterprise bonus fund is for plugging loopholes"; "The enterprise bonus fund is a cake in the window, you can see it but you can't eat it." This phenomenon is certainly related to the fact that the enterprise bonus fund usage regulations are too general, but if the leaders of factories and mines really care about the lives of workers and use this money reasonably, some problems in the lives of workers can be solved.
    Some responsible departments do not understand the actual situation of enterprises, and the labor plans are set too tightly and rigidly. No matter how the product plan changes, it is not allowed to be modified; the number of probationary workers is not enough; without the approval of the Ministry of Industry, enterprises have no right to increase workers according to production needs. This increases the difficulty of enterprise management and also encourages bureaucracy in enterprise leadership. In order to complete the task, they work overtime or expand the viewing rate; coupled with too many meetings, crowded dormitories or distance from the factory, workers do not get enough sleep, and the more overtime they work, the more illnesses and absenteeism occur, forming a vicious circle. At the same time, the enterprise fails to fully utilize labor protection facilities to improve the working conditions of workers, resulting in continuous serious work-related injuries. These directly affect the health of workers and also increase the difficulties of workers.
    The trade union is a mass organization and should always care about the lives of workers, resolutely fight against bureaucracy in management work, assist enterprise administrations and relevant departments in correcting shortcomings and errors in management work, and play the supervisory role of the trade union; it should reasonably use trade union funds, organize mass mutual assistance, give play to the strength of the masses, and solve the difficulties of the masses. However, our trade union work has not been done well, and it is often a one-legged jump; it is right to oppose economism and organize the masses to widely launch labor competitions; but there has also been a bias toward not caring enough about the lives of workers. Some responsible comrades of the trade union leading organs, including myself, have not often gone deep into the masses to check the work of trade union grassroots organizations, understand the suffering of workers, and help enterprise administrations and trade union organizations improve the lives of workers in a practical way under possible conditions, but instead are trapped in the bureaucratic quagmire and cannot extricate themselves, which is also an important reason why the trade union has not played its due role.
    Too many children born to workers also increases the difficulty of life. From the survey materials of textile factories, the birth rate of female workers is very high and is growing rapidly. By the end of 1955, there were 141,484 female workers in the factories under the Ministry of Textile Industry, and 98,445 children were born in three years. The historical birth rate of female workers in state-owned textile factories in Shanghai (the ratio of the total number of female workers in the current year to the number of children born) is: 22.37% in 1952, 23.5% in 1953, 25.3% in 1954, and 26.17% in 1955. At the same time, the mortality rate of children is decreasing year by year. This phenomenon on the one hand shows the improvement of the material life of workers, on the other hand, it also causes a series of problems that are not easy to solve. First of all, although the wages of workers are constantly increasing, they cannot keep up with the increase in child-rearing expenses. For example, Shen Lesheng, a technician in the leather roller workshop of Beijing No. 1 Cotton Factory, and his wife both work, with a monthly income of 152 yuan. His salary has not changed in recent years. In 1950, they only had three children, a family of five, and the average monthly living expenses per person was 30.4 yuan, and they lived a good life. From 1951 to 1954, one child was born every year, and the population increased to nine people, but the average monthly living expenses per person dropped to 17 yuan. Of course, because both husband and wife work, their current life is not difficult, but because there are many children, the living standard is deteriorating, not as rich as before. The electrician Lu Tong of the factory earned 48 yuan in 1951, with a family of six (husband and wife, a father, three children), with an average monthly living expense of 8 yuan per person; in 1954, the salary increased to 56 yuan, and another child was born, and the average per person was still 8 yuan per month; in 1956, the salary increased to 74 yuan, but the number of children also increased by one, and the average monthly living expenses per person only increased by 1.2 yuan. If this worker had fewer children, then their lives would obviously be better. Secondly, the construction of worker housing and nurseries is expanded every year, but it still cannot keep up with the needs of population growth. The development of housing is very fast. Taking the textile factory with more housing before liberation as an example, the newly built housing area after liberation is generally one to three times larger than before. The number of workers has not increased much, but the housing is still not enough. One of the main reasons is the rapid increase in population. In 1955, the number of nursery beds generally increased by more than 2.5 times compared with 1952. Many factories and mines also organized the strength of the masses and organized many childcare services, but they can only accommodate a small part of the children who should be accommodated, and most of the children are still unattended. Having more children affects the health of adults and children. Some children are simply wild children due to the lack of adult discipline. In order for workers to live better and for the health of children, it is necessary to conduct publicity and education on birth control among the workers.
    Improving the lives of workers requires efforts in many ways, not just on the wage aspect. In addition to supervising the administration to gradually improve the lives of workers in all aspects on the basis of developing production, the trade union should also vigorously organize the strength of the masses to solve some of the problems that the masses urgently need to solve. In this regard, we have gained some experience. Self-built housing with public assistance for workers is a very good experience. Many local party committees and governments have adopted this method to help workers solve some housing difficulties. For example, ten textile factories in Qingdao built 23,606.99 square meters in this way from 1950 to 1955, solving the housing of 688 workers' families, with an average of 34.7 square meters per household. The masses responded well, and another 1,906 households signed up this year. People in many regions have this requirement. However, some localities have not solved the problems of land and building materials that can be reasonably solved in time, which has affected the promotion of this experience. It is hoped that governments and enterprises in various places will pay attention to this experience and promote it in a planned way.
    In order to improve the work of trade unions, it is hoped that local party committees will appropriately fix the necessary cadres of trade unions so that they can better connect with the masses and accumulate experience. This is also the preparatory work for the Party to cultivate and draw cadres from trade union organizations. It is hoped that the Party committees in various places will regularly check the work of trade unions, criticize the bureaucratic work style of trade union cadres who do not care about the lives of the masses, strengthen the education of trade union cadres, and continuously improve their political and ideological level, so that trade unions can become a stronger organization for the Party to connect with the masses.

    从多方面关心职工生活
    中华全国总工会书记处书记　陈少敏
    我们的党和政府一贯地十分关怀职工的物质文化生活。在国家每年的年度计划中都规定，随着劳动生产率的增长，提高职工工资水平的指标。虽然，1955年工业各部门职工平均工资的增长落后于劳动生产率的增长，但比1952年则增长了14.7％，1955年全国职工的平均工资比1952年增长了19.3％。三年来国家为改善职工的劳动条件，仅对重工业、铁路、第一机械、第二机械、纺织等五个部所属的国营厂矿企业等就投资了一万二千二百五十五万元，其中女职工多的纺织工业占二千零一十七万元。我们的国家年年都在增建职工住宅、托儿所和卫生事业。职工疗养院、休养所、文化宫、俱乐部等集体福利事业在解放前是从来没有的，现在也大批兴建起来了。从各方面来看，职工的物质文化生活水平都是逐年提高的。工人们说：“饮水不忘掘井人”“要努力生产，建设社会主义来回答共产党、毛主席对我们的关怀。”
    当然不是说职工的生活已经很好了。事实上，职工生活上还存在不少问题，部分职工的生活还有困难。这里应该指出的是：我们建国还只有七年，我们党领导全国人民进行了艰巨的斗争，克服了旧社会遗留下来的严重经济困难，战胜了天灾，恢复和发展了国民经济，开始了社会主义建设，职工的物质文化生活才达到了今天的水平。现在我们还刚开始建设社会主义，职工生活上的问题，还不可能在短时期内完全解决。但是，如果我们根据需要和可能，从各方面努力，职工生活上的困难是可以减少一些的。问题在于我们工作中存在着官僚主义，以致有些是目前可以解决的问题也没有及时解决。
    国家每年都拨出了增长职工工资的基金，但是由于有些厂矿企业领导者对职工生活关心不够，主管机关督促不力，没有按时调整工资，合理地使用这部分工资基金，却把它积压起来，这就使工资的增长和劳动生产率的提高更不相适应。
    企业奖励基金是很大的一笔经费，但却未发挥它应有的作用。有的用来盖办公楼，有的用作修理费，有的用作招待费，有的拿去买打字机，有的存到银行里等等，使企业奖励基金失掉了奖励意义，所以有人说：“企业奖励基金是塞漏洞的”；“企业奖励基金是橱窗里的蛋糕，看得见，吃不到”。这种现象固然与企业奖励基金使用办法规定的太笼统有关系，但是如果厂矿企业领导同志们切实关心职工生活，合理地使用这笔钱，是可以解决职工生活上的一些问题的。
    有的主管部门对企业的实际情况了解不够，劳动计划定得过紧过死，不论产品计划怎样改变，都不许修改；预备工规定得又不够；不经过工业部批准，企业无权根据生产需要增加工人。这就增加了企业管理上的困难，也助长了企业领导上的官僚主义。他们为了完成任务就加班加点或扩大看台率；再加上会议多，宿舍挤或离厂远，职工睡眠不足，越加班加点，疾病缺勤就越多，形成恶性循环。同时，企业没有充分发挥劳动保护设施的作用，改善职工的劳动条件，致使严重的工伤事故不断发生。这些都直接影响了职工健康，也增加了职工的困难。
    工会是群众的组织，应该经常地关心职工生活，坚决地向管理工作中的官僚主义作斗争，协助企业行政和有关部门纠正管理工作中的缺点和错误，发挥工会的监督作用；应该合理地利用工会经费，组织群众互助，发挥群众力量，解决群众的困难。但是，我们的工会工作还没有作好，走路还不稳，常常是一条腿跳；反对了经济主义，组织群众广泛地展开了劳动竞赛，这是对的；但是又产生了对职工生活关心不够的偏向。工会领导机关的某些负责同志连我自己在内，没有经常地深入到群众中去，检查工会基层组织的工作，了解职工的疾苦，帮助企业行政和工会组织在可能的条件下，切实地改善职工生活，却陷在辛辛苦苦的官僚主义泥坑里而不能自拔，这也是使工会没有起到应有作用的一个重要原因。
    职工生育子女过多，也增加了生活困难。从纺织厂的调查材料来看，女职工的生育率很高，而且增长很快。到1955年底止，纺织工业部所属各厂的女职工有十四万一千四百八十四人，三年内就生了九万八千四百四十五个孩子。国营上海各纺织厂女职工历年的生育率（当年女职工总数和所生孩子比）为：1952年22.37％，1953年23.5％，1954年25.3％，1955年26.17％。与此同时，儿童的死亡率却是逐年下降。这种现象一方面说明职工物质生活的改善，另一方面也引起了一系列不容易解决的问题。首先是职工的工资虽然不断的增长，但是赶不上子女养育费的增加。例如国棉北京一厂皮辊间技术工人沈乐生，夫妻两人工作，每月收入一百五十二元。几年来工资没动，在1950年他们只有三个小孩，全家五口人，平均每人每月生活费是三十点四元，生活过得很好。从1951年到1954年，每年生一个孩子，人口增加到九人，每人每月生活费却降低到十七元。当然，他们因为夫妻两人都工作，现在的生活没有困难，但是由于孩子多，生活水平是每况愈下，没有以前富裕了。该厂电气工人吕通，1951年工资是四十八元，全家六口人（夫妻两人，一个父亲、三个小孩），平均每人每月的生活费是八元；1954年工资增加到五十六元，又生了一个孩子，平均每人每月还是八元；1956年工资增加到七十四元，但孩子也增加了一个，平均每人每月生活费只增加了一点二元。假若这个工人少生一个孩子，那么他们的生活显然是可以好些的。其次，职工住宅、托儿所年年扩建，仍赶不上人口增长的需要。住宅的发展是很快的。就以解放前住宅较多的纺织厂来说，解放后新建的住宅面积一般的比以前增加了一倍到三倍。职工人数增加并不大，但住宅仍然不够。主要原因之一就是人口增加的快。一九五五年托儿所的床位比一九五二年一般的增加了二点五倍以上，许多厂矿企业还组织群众力量，举办了许多儿童保育事业，但是只能收托应托儿童的一小部分，大部分孩子还是无人照顾。生孩子多了，大人孩子的健康都受到影响，有些孩子因缺乏大人管教，简直成了野孩子。为了职工们生活得更好，为了孩子们的健康，在职工群众中切实地进行节制生育的宣传教育是十分必要的。
    改善职工生活，需要从多方面努力，不单单是工资一方面的问题。工会除了监督行政在发展生产的基础上从各方面逐步地改善职工生活外，还应该大力组织群众力量来解决一些群众迫切需要解决的问题。在这方面我们已经取得了一些经验。职工住宅自建公助就是一条很好的经验。许多地方的党委和政府，已经采取这个办法，帮助职工解决了一部分住宅困难。例如青岛十个纺织厂，从一九五○年到一九五五年就这样建筑了二万三千六百零六点九九平方公尺，解决了六百八十八户职工的住宅，平均每户三十四点七平方公尺，群众反映很好，今年又有一千九百零六户报名。许多地区的群众都有这种要求。但是有些地方对可以合理解决的地皮、建筑材料等问题，没有及时解决，影响了这一经验的推广。希望各地政府和各企业单位重视这一经验，有计划地加以推广。
    为了改进工会工作，希望各地党委适当地固定工会的必要干部，以便他们更好地联系群众，积累经验。这也就是党从工会组织中培养和抽调干部的准备工作。希望各地党委经常地检查工会工作，批判工会干部不关心群众生活的官僚主义作风，加强对工会干部的教育，不断地提高他们的政治思想水平，使工会成为党联系群众的更强有力的组织。
