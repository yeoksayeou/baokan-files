Why Not Tell the Truth?
　　Shen Shi
　　The Xinjiang Petroleum Administration once sent people to Shanghai to recruit technical workers. The workers in Shanghai, hearing that they had the opportunity to participate in the construction of the frontier, eagerly signed up to apply.

　　However, some of the comrades in charge of recruitment did not proceed from reality when introducing the situation in Xinjiang, and often exaggerated the local living environment and working conditions. Some said, "Go to the Xinjiang Petroleum Company! There are high-rise buildings to live in there, and every room has a radio." Some said, "The machine repair factory of the Xinjiang Petroleum Company has very good equipment, and the machines are all shipped from the Soviet Union. There are Soviet experts guiding in the workshop."

　　When the recruited workers arrived in Xinjiang, in the Kelamayi oil area, some experienced the harsh life here, and recalling what the recruiters had said at the beginning, they became dissatisfied. They said, "Why exaggerate so much? Would we not come to participate in the construction of the motherland's frontier if the truth were told? Are you afraid that we are afraid of the harsh environment?"

　　In the past, those who recruited young women from Xinjiang to rural Shandong also exaggerated the introduction of their farms, saying something like "Our farm has two-story buildings, with electricity and telephones." Some of the young women came to the farm and slept in dugout dwellings, and lit oil lamps. They said, "Where are the buildings? Where is the electricity?"

　　These personnel responsible for recruitment have underestimated the socialist consciousness of our younger generation, underestimated the vigorous enthusiasm of young people to participate in the construction of the motherland's frontier, and spared no effort to embellish and talk nonsense. However, they did not expect what kind of consequences such exaggerations would cause.

    为什么不说出真实情况
  　沈石
    新疆石油管理局曾经派人到上海招聘技术工人，上海的工人们听说有机会参加边疆建设，踊跃地报名应聘。
    但是，某些招聘的同志在介绍新疆情况的时候，不是从实际出发，往往把当地的生活环境和工作条件夸张地说一通。有的说：“你们到新疆石油公司去吧！那里住的是高楼，每间房都有收音机。”有的说：“新疆石油公司的机械修理厂设备很好，机器都是从苏联运来的，车间里边有苏联专家指导。”
    当应聘的工人到了新疆，到了克拉玛依油区的时候，有些人尝试了这儿艰苦的生活，回想起当初招聘人员说过的那番话，就引起不满。他们说：“为什么要夸大的说一番呢？难道说出了真实情况，我们就不来参加祖国的边疆建设吗？难道怕我们害怕艰苦的环境吗？”
    过去，从新疆到山东农村招收女青年的人，也曾经夸张地介绍过他们所在的农场，说什么“我们的农场，楼上楼下，电灯电话。”有的女青年来到农场之后，睡的是地窝子，点的是油灯。她们说：“楼在哪里呢？电灯在那里呢？”
    这些负责招聘工作的人员未免低估了我们青年一代的社会主义觉悟，低估了青年们参加祖国边疆建设的蓬勃热情，就不惜锦上添花的乱说一通。但是，他们没有想到这样的夸夸其谈，会引起什么样的后果。
