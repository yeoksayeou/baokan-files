    Bumper Harvest Scenes in Agricultural Cooperatives

    Great Harvest After Cooperation
    The Meicun Agricultural Cooperative in Shuangling Township, Guichi County, Anhui Province, reaped a great harvest this year. The 160.05 mu of double-cropping early rice yielded an average of over 540 jin per mu. The more than 46 mu of tidal lake fields, which never yielded any harvest before, also produced 9,200 jin of rice. The 240+ mu of mid-season rice yielded an average of 454 jin of rice per mu. Currently, the late rice is growing well and is expected to yield about 300 jin per mu. Other dryland crops have also increased production significantly compared to last year. The total output of this cooperative this year can reach more than 380,000 jin, exceeding last year's total output by more than 200%. Each member can receive an average of 983 jin of grain. The members excitedly said: "This year is the first year of cooperation, and also our first year of increased production."

    Grain-Deficient Cooperative Becomes Grain-Surplus Cooperative
    The Daozhu Agricultural Cooperative in Tanxu Township, Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, achieved a grain yield of 900 jin per mu this year, an increase of 56.8% compared to the time of the elementary cooperative last year. The whole cooperative can distribute an average of 613 jin of grain per person. Poor peasant member Ding Guocheng, whose family has five members, only received 800 jin of grain and 300 jin of sweet potato threads last year. After joining the advanced cooperative this year, he received 2,500 jin of early rice alone, and it is expected that he can still receive 900 jin of late rice and 700 jin of sweet potato threads. He said: "Since I was born, I have never harvested so much grain. If it weren't for joining the advanced cooperative, I would never have dreamed of it!"
    The Daozhu Agricultural Cooperative has changed from a grain-deficient cooperative to a grain-surplus cooperative. In the past, during the time of the elementary cooperative, the state had to supply 65,000 jin of grain every year. This year, when the early rice was harvested, more than 4,000 jin of surplus grain was sold to the state, and even more will be sold after the autumn harvest.

    Strive for Every Grain to Return Home
    The more than 14,000 mu of autumn crops in the Lianyi Agricultural Cooperative in Cang County, Hebei Province, can yield at least 3.1 million jin of raw grain; including the summer crops, a total of 3.7 million jin of grain was produced, an increase of 85% compared to last year.
    Recently, after preliminary calculations by the cooperative, an average able-bodied worker can receive 2,400 to 2,600 jin of grain, and stronger laborers can receive 2,800 to 3,000 jin of grain. More than 90% of the members can increase their income. However, the members are not complacent at all. Under the slogan of "Every Grain Returns Home", they are actively carrying out "careful harvesting and meticulous threshing", striving to increase production by another two jin per mu on the basis of the bumper harvest.
            (Fusheng, Baoqi, Xiurong)

    The Encouragement of the Bumper Harvest
    The result of the trial distribution of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Wuchuan County, Inner Mongolia, located at the foot of the Daqing Mountains, shows that the cooperative can distribute 68% of its total income to the members, allowing more than 95% of the members to increase their income. The actual income of each member's labor day reached two yuan and two fen, exceeding three times the highest bonus of last year's cooperative. The members' hearts are filled with unlimited joy, and their enthusiasm for production is even higher under the encouragement of the overall bumper harvest. At present, each production team has launched a competition to rush harvest wheat, and more than 95% of the female members have also gone to the fields. In order to prevent mature crops from suffering natural disasters, each team has also organized a "Night Battle Brigade" to rush harvest at night.

    农业社丰收景象
    合作化后大丰收
    安徽贵池县双岭乡梅村农业社，今年获得了大丰收。一百六十亩零五分双季早稻，每亩平均收五百四十多斤。从来没有收成的四十六亩多起潮湖田，也收了九千二百多斤稻谷。二百四十多亩中稻，每亩平均收稻四百五十四斤。目前，晚稻成长良好，预计每亩能收到三百斤左右。其它旱地作物，也比去年增产不少。这个社今年的总产量可达到三十八万多斤，超过去年总产量的200％还多。每个社员，平均可分粮九百八十三斤。社员们兴奋地说：“今年是合作化的头一年，也是我们增产的头一年。”

    缺粮社变成了余粮社
    湖南平江县谈胥乡稻竹农业社，今年粮食单位面积产量每亩平均九百斤，比去年初级社时增长了56.8％。全社平均每人能分粮食六百一十三斤。贫农社员丁果成，全家有五口人，去年只分得八百斤谷、三百斤茴丝，今年入高级社后，光早稻就分了二千五百斤，预计晚稻还可分到九百斤、茴丝能分到七百斤。他说：“我从娘胎出世，还没有收过这样多粮食，要不是入高级社，真是做梦也想不到！”
    稻竹农业社已经由缺粮社变成余粮社了。在往年初级社时，每年总要国家供应六万五千斤粮食，今年早稻收割时，就出卖了四千多斤余粮给国家，秋收后还会卖得更多。

    争取颗粒还家
    河北沧县联益农业社的一万四千多亩秋季作物，至少可收原粮三百一十多万斤；连同夏季作物计算在内，共产粮食三百七十多万斤，比去年增产85％。
    最近，社里经过初步计算，一个普通劳动力能分到二千四百至二千六百斤粮食，较强的劳动力能分到二千八百至三千斤粮食，90％以上的社员都能增加收入。可是社员们一点也不自满，他们在“颗粒还家”的口号下，正积极开展“精收细打”，争取在丰收的基础上，每亩再增产二斤粮。
            （福生、宝起、秀荣）
    丰收的鼓舞
    位于大青山脚下的内蒙武川县先锋农业社，试算分配的结果，全社可将总收入的68％分给社员，使95％以上的社员增加收入。社员每个劳动日的实际收益达到两元零二分，超过了去年分红数最高社的三倍。社员们心里充满着无限的喜悦，他们在全面丰收的鼓舞下，生产积极性更加高涨。目前，各生产队已展开了抢收小麦的竞赛，95％以上的女社员也都下地了。为了不使成熟的庄稼遭受自然灾害，各队还组织了“夜战大队”，在夜间突击抢收。
