    Should Properly Resolve the Contradiction Between Agriculture and Handicraft Industry
    In Feixi County, Anhui Province, some agricultural production cooperatives have experienced serious conflicts with the handicraft industry in towns and townships when developing sideline production, and these conflicts have not been properly resolved for a long time.
    Take the twenty-seven agricultural cooperatives in the former Huagang and Gaoliu districts of the county as an example. Since these cooperatives began to develop sideline production this spring, they have formed thirty specialized handicraft production groups composed of farmers who were originally engaged in part-time handicraft industry and those who have always been engaged in agricultural production. Among them, carpentry alone has 217 people, which is more than one and a half times the number of members of the carpentry production cooperative in the towns and townships of these two districts. Nie Erchun, a member of the Dengta Agricultural Cooperative in Zhongpai Township, only learned blacksmithing (mainly operating the bellows) from his brother Nie Erjun for one year when he was a child, and has been engaged in agricultural production ever since. Now, the agricultural cooperative has transferred him from the familiar agricultural production to form an ironware repair group with the production team leader Wu Mingzhu and the member Ni Yousheng. The latter two have never engaged in handicraft industry. What is more serious is that some cadres of agricultural cooperatives have also adopted the means of offering benefits to win over members of handicraft production cooperatives. Many agricultural cooperatives control the raw materials needed for handicraft production, preventing farmers from selling them to handicraft production cooperatives.
    Because the above contradictions have not been properly resolved for a long time, it has brought great losses to both agricultural production and handicraft production.
    In May of this year, during the rice transplanting season, fifty-nine waterwheels of the Xinguang Agricultural Cooperative in Wangmiao Township, former Gangji District, were in urgent need of repair. In order to support the farmer brothers, the Gangji Carpentry Production Cooperative took the initiative to suggest to the district committee that they would send people to help repair them, but the district committee refused on the pretext of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily." The bamboo ware production group of the Dongdawei Agricultural Cooperative has lower technology, and the price of each load of rice baskets is 30% to 40% higher than that of the handicraft production cooperative. The big shovels produced by the ironware production group of the Shaomaigang Agricultural Cooperative are of poor quality and cannot be used, so the masses brought them to the town to be reworked. In order to support agricultural production and take care of the busy farming season, the county's handicraft production cooperatives actively organized mobile repair groups to go to the countryside for repairs, but the repair group in Yandun was driven back by the township, who said: How can our money be given to you?
    Due to the large-scale organization of handicraft production by agricultural cooperatives, the control of raw materials, the random sale of handicraft products in the market, and the violation of contracts, many handicraft cooperatives have suspended production and the lives of their members have become difficult. The Donggang Sewing Group has thirteen members. Due to the rigid exclusion of agricultural cooperatives, they only received 23 yuan in wages in April and May, and each person's income was less than 1.8 yuan. Because the Wenfeng Agricultural Cooperative also set up a woodworking shop in the market, the Chengdian Carpentry Production Group only sold two small benches in March and April. Many members of handicraft cooperatives are pessimistic and disappointed, some asking to withdraw from the cooperative, and some even disbanding on their own.
    Why have these serious problems in the handicraft industry of Feixi County not been resolved for a long time? The following facts will make it clear.
    In order to support agricultural production, the handicraft industry of Feixi County signed a batch of roller and rake (iron roller) production and sales contracts with agricultural cooperatives. Later, some agricultural cooperatives wanted to break the contracts and not buy them. For this reason, the county handicraft industry association asked Vice County Chief Zhang Hua for instructions, but Zhang Hua said: You should take care of the interests of the agricultural cooperatives, and if the agricultural cooperatives don't want them, then so be it.
    The county party committee had studied and prepared to transfer part of the handicraft industry of agricultural cooperatives to the leadership of the handicraft industry in towns and townships, and issued documents to various townships, but Lu Xianrui, member of the county party committee and deputy director of the rural work department, blocked the agricultural cooperatives from implementing the instructions of the county party committee on the pretext that he was working in the countryside and did not know about it.
    How can we not have chaos down below when these quite responsible leading comrades cannot act in accordance with national policies, and how can the problem be resolved quickly?

### 应该妥善解决农业和手工业的矛盾

    应该妥善解决农业和手工业的矛盾
    安徽省肥西县有些农业生产合作社在开展副业生产时与集镇手工业生产发生了严重的矛盾，而且长期未能获得妥善解决。
    现仅举该县原化岗、高刘两区二十七个农业社为例，这些社自今春开展副业生产以来，就把原来兼营点手工业的和一向从事农业生产的农民，组成三十个专业性的手工业生产组，其中单木业就有二百十七人，超过这两区集镇上木业生产社社员的一倍半。中派乡灯塔农业社社员聂而春仅在幼时跟他哥哥聂而俊学了一年的铁匠（主要是拉风箱），后来一直从事农业生产，现在农业社却把他从熟习的农业生产中调出与生产队长吴明柱、社员倪有圣等三人组织了一个铁器包修小组。后二人从未干过手工业。更严重的是：有些农业社的干部还采取利诱的手段拉拢手工业生产社的社员。很多农业社对于手工业生产所需要的原料，进行控制，不让农民卖给手工业生产社。
    由于以上矛盾长期未能得到妥善解决，因而给农业生产和手工业生产均带来了很大的损失。
    今年5月间正是插秧季节，当时原岗集区汪庙乡新光农业社有五十九辆水车急待修理使用，岗集木业生产社为了支援农民兄弟，曾主动向区委建议，准备派人帮助修理，但区委却以“勤俭办社”为借口加以拒绝。东大圩农业社的竹器生产组由于技术较低，每担稻箩价格比手工业生产社高30％—40％。烧脉岗农业社的铁器生产组生产的大锹由于质量差，不能用，群众又拿到集镇上来重新返工。该县的手工业生产社为了支持农业生产，照顾农忙，曾积极组织流动修配组下乡修配，但烟墩的修配小组却被乡里赶回来了，他们说：我们的钱怎么能给你们搞去呢？
    由于农业社大量的组织手工业生产、控制原料、乱到市场出售手工业产品，及违反合约，使得很多手工业合作社生产停顿，社员生活发生困难。董岗缝纫组有组员十三人，由于农业社的硬性排挤，四、五两月份仅得工资二十三元，每人所得工资还不到一元八角钱。程店木业生产组因为文丰农业社也在集上设立了木器门市部，因而三、四两月仅卖掉两条小板凳。很多手工业社的社员悲观失望，有的要求退社，有的甚至自动解散。
    肥西县手工业存在的这些严重问题为什么长期得不到解决，请看下面的事实，就会明白了。
    肥西县的手工业为了支持农业生产，曾与农业社签订了一批辊耖（铁轧）产销合同，后来有些农业社又要毁约不要，该县手工业联社为此曾请示副县长张化，而张化却说：你们应该照顾农业社的利益，农业社不要就算了。
    该县县委曾研究准备把一部分农业社的手工业划归集镇手工业领导，并以文件下达各乡，但县委委员、农村工作部副部长卢献瑞因在农村工作，却借口不知道，阻止农业社执行县委指示。
    像这些相当负责的领导同志，都不能按照国家政策办事，怎能叫下边不发生混乱呢，问题又怎能很快得到解决呢？
