Xinhua News Agency, October 24th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations Asian-African Group demanded on October 23rd that France immediately release the five illegally kidnapped Algerian national leaders and condemned France's actions as threatening peace and security in North Africa.

That day, the representatives of the Asian-African Group held an emergency meeting specifically for this matter. Following the meeting, a communique was issued expressing shock at the "manner" in which the French authorities kidnapped the Algerian leaders from a Moroccan commercial aircraft under highly unusual circumstances. The communique stated that this kidnapping action by France "further disrupts peace and security in North Africa and makes a peaceful resolution of the Algerian question and the fulfillment of the legitimate aspirations of the Algerian people more difficult."

The communique demanded that the French authorities restore the freedom of the illegally arrested Algerian national leaders so that talks between Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria to discuss a peaceful resolution of the Algerian question could be held immediately.

The United Nations Asian-African Group also requested that United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld try to persuade France to release the five arrested Algerian national leaders.

Twenty-five representatives, including those from Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria, attended yesterday's emergency meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, October 24th, Cairo Dispatch: According to TASS, the Arab League Council convened an emergency meeting on October 23rd to discuss the situation created by the Algerian French authorities' cunning kidnapping of five leaders of the "Algerian National Liberation Front."

The meeting passed a resolution deciding to appeal to the leaders of Tunisia and Morocco, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and the representatives of Asian and African countries to the United Nations to find ways to have the arrested persons released immediately.

Fawzi Mulki, who presided over the Arab League Council meeting, told reporters that the actions of the French authorities were atrocities. He said that this action proves that "France's tyranny in Algeria is endless." He said that France should understand that the era of rampant hegemony has passed.

Many newspapers in Cairo protested the French authorities' atrocity of kidnapping leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front. "Al Messa" wrote that this action is not a victory for France, but another disgrace for France. It said that this action will further reduce France's prestige in the eyes of the people of North Africa, and of course, these actions cannot stop the Algerian people from fighting for their liberation.

    新华社24日讯　纽约消息：联合国亚非集团10月23日要求法国立即释放被非法绑架的五个阿尔及利亚民族领袖，并且谴责法国的这种行为威胁到北非的和平和安全。
    这一天亚非集团的各国代表特地为这件事举行了紧急会议，会后发表公报，对法国当局在极不平常的状况下从一架摩洛哥商业飞机上绑架阿尔及利亚领袖的这种“方式”表示震惊。公报说，法国的这一绑架行动“进一步扰乱了北非的和平和安全，而且使得和平解决阿尔及利亚问题和满足阿尔及利亚人民合法愿望变得更加困难。”
    公报要求法国当局恢复被非法逮捕的阿尔及利亚民族领袖的自由，以便讨论和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的摩洛哥、突尼斯和阿尔及利亚的会谈能立即举行。
    联合国亚非集团还要求联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德设法促使法国释放这五个被捕的阿尔及利亚民族领袖。
    参加昨天紧急会议的有二十五个代表，其中包括摩洛哥、突尼斯和阿尔及利亚的代表。
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社开罗讯：阿拉伯联盟理事会在10月23日召开紧急会议，讨论了“阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线”五个领袖被阿尔及利亚法国当局用诡计绑架一事所造成的局势。
    会议通过决议，决定向突尼斯和摩洛哥的领导人、联合国秘书长和亚非国家驻联合国的代表呼吁设法使被捕的人立刻获释。
    主持阿拉伯联盟理事会会议的法齐·穆尔基同记者们谈话时指出，法国当局的行为是一种暴行。他说，这种行动证明了“法国在阿尔及利亚的暴虐无道是无止境的”。他说，法国应当明白，横行霸道的时代已经过去了。
    开罗许多报纸都抗议法国当局绑架阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线领导人的暴行。“晚报”写道，这种作法并不是法国的胜利，而是法国的又一个耻辱。它说，这种行动将进一步降低法国在北非人民心目中的威信，当然，这些行动决不能使阿尔及利亚人民停止为争取自己解放所进行的斗争。
