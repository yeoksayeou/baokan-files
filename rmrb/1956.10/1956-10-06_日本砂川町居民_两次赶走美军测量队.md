Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 5th -- Residents of Sunagawa Town near Tokyo, Japan, twice drove away a survey team attempting to expand the US Tachikawa Air Base in their hometown today and yesterday.

This morning, the Japanese government dispatched 52 surveyors to the planned survey area, attempting to survey the residents' land. In order to defend their homes, local residents and supporting Socialist Party members of parliament immediately gathered and formed a blockade, preventing the survey team from starting work. Because the survey team attempted to force the survey, a short conflict occurred between the two sides. However, the residents resolutely resisted, finally forcing the survey team to leave the survey area. Yesterday, approximately 1,000 people, including residents of Sunagawa Town, members of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and members of the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, similarly prevented the survey work.

    两次赶走美军测量队
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本东京附近的砂川町居民在今天和昨天两次赶走了企图在他们的家乡扩大美国立川空军基地的测量队。
    今天早晨，日本政府派遣了五十二个测量队员进入了预定测量地区，企图测量居民们的土地。为了保卫家园，当地居民和支持他们的社会党议员立即集合起来，组成了封锁线，阻止测量队开始工作。由于测量队企图强行测量，双方曾经发生了短时间的冲突。但是居民们坚决抵抗，终于迫使测量队离开了测量区。昨天，砂川町居民和日本工会总评议会的会员，全日本学生自治会总联合会的会员共约一千人，同样地阻止了测量工作。
