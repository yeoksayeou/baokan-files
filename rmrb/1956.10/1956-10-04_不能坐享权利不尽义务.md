    Cannot Enjoy Rights Without Fulfilling Obligations

    The Sichuan-Yunnan Highway is a transportation artery linking the southwestern provinces. Long neglected and severely damaged during the reactionary government's rule, it was still impassable by 1954.

    In early 1955, our 531st Geological Prospecting Team went to the Jinsha River banks to prospect for iron ore. All our materials, machinery, and equipment had to be transported via this highway and then shipped across the Jinsha River. At the time, we repeatedly requested the original Xikang Province Department of Transportation to repair this stretch of road, less than eighty kilometers long, but the response was that they were "unable to repair it." Due to the urgent need for prospecting, our team had to invest in repairing the road ourselves. In March 1955, the Sichuan-Yunnan Highway, which had been out of service for nearly ten years, was reopened from Luchang to Yuzha on the Jinsha River. Subsequently, the Sichuan-Yunnan Highway within Yunnan Province was also repaired to the Jinsha River, facing Yuzha across the river. The Yunnan Province transportation departments started operating scheduled and unscheduled passenger bus services.

    Our team spent approximately 30,000 yuan to repair this section of the roadbed. After the repairs, we contacted the Xichang County Transportation Section and the Huili County Construction Section multiple times, requesting them to inspect and take over the road. They sent people to inspect the roadbed at the time but did not mention taking it over, yet they published a notice about bus service schedules in the Sichuan Daily. They also established a passenger transport liaison office in Yuzha. In addition to passenger transport, over 100 tons of goods were transported from other places to Sichuan via this route each month.

    This highway, repaired by us, has already been serving the Sichuan transportation departments. However, they still haven't taken it over or maintained it. With the arrival of the rainy season this year, the roadbed is constantly collapsing. Our team has dozens of machines drilling here, and if the road becomes impassable, it will affect the supply of fuel and materials, causing the drilling rigs to stop working. We have had to divert a group of people from production to form a "road maintenance team" to carry out emergency repairs at any time, resulting in a situation where our team repairs the road while the transportation departments operate their businesses. When the road is damaged, their buses stop; as soon as the road is repaired, our vehicles move forward, and the passenger transport vehicles closely follow to conduct business.

    We hope that the Sichuan Province Department of Transportation will quickly send people to take over this section of the road and maintain it properly. They cannot continue to enjoy rights without fulfilling obligations.

### 不能坐享权利不尽义务

    不能坐享权利不尽义务
    川滇公路是联结西南各省的交通干线。在反动政府统治时代长期失修，路基损坏很大，到1954年还不能通车。
    1955年初，我们五三一地质勘探队到金沙江两岸勘探铁矿，一切物资机械设备必须经过这段公路，再经金沙江上运。当时，我们曾几次要求原西康省交通厅修复这段不足八十公里长的路基，但得到的回答是他们“无力修复”。由于勘探急需，我队只得自己投资修路。1955年3月间，停驶近十年的川滇公路又从鹿厂通车到金沙江边的鱼鲊了。接着云南境内的川滇公路也修复到金沙江边，与鱼鲊隔江相望。云南省交通部门开办了定期与不定期的客运班车。
    我队为了修复这段路基，花费约达三万元。修复后，我们曾多次向西昌县交通科和会理县建设科联系，请他们验收接管。当时他们派人视察了这段路基，却没有提接管的事，就在四川日报上公布通车班次启事。并在鱼鲊设立了客运接洽处。每月除客运外，由这条线路从外地运到四川的物资即达一百多吨。
    这条由我们修复起来的公路，已经为四川交通部门服务了。然而，他们还是不来接管，不来养护。今年雨季来到，路基不断的垮，我队有几十台机器在这里钻探，一旦不能通车就会影响油料和器材的供应，造成钻机停工，我们不得不从生产上抽调一批人组成“道班”，随时抢修。以致形成我队修路，交通部门营业的局面。路坏了他们的班车停驶；路一修好我们的车子前面走，客班运输营业车紧跟着赶上来。
    希望四川省交通厅赶快派人接管这段线路，好好养护起来。不能再坐享权利，不尽义务了。
