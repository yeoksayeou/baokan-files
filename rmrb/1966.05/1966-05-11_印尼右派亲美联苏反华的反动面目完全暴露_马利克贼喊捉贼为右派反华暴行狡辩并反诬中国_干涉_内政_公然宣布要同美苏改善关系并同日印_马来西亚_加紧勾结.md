    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 10th: A foreign policy statement made by Indonesian Foreign Minister Adam Malik on May 5th at the Plenary Session of the Gotong Royong Parliament indicates that the Indonesian right-wing military regime is intensifying its pursuit of a pro-US, pro-Soviet, and anti-China counter-revolutionary foreign policy.

    According to Antara News Agency, Malik said that "the government has re-examined the foreign policy it has pursued so far" and decided to adopt a "new attitude."

    Malik, inverting black and white, attributed the "recent difficulties in the relationship between Indonesia and People's China" to "China's constant attacks on Indonesia." He nonsensically claimed that China "openly stated its failure to understand" the developments in Indonesia since the September 30th Movement, and that "People's China constantly attacked Indonesia. These attacks became increasingly severe, openly disregarding the situation in Indonesia."

    Malik described the reports by Chinese newspapers and radio stations about the Indonesian right-wing military regime's frenzied anti-communist, anti-people, anti-China, and anti-Chinese atrocities and persecution as "irresponsible" and "insulting attacks" on Indonesia. He attempted to make people believe that the series of fascist atrocities of attacking, destroying, and seizing Chinese diplomatic missions in Indonesia, organized and directed by the Indonesian right-wing military regime, were "understandable and logical." According to Malik's absurd logic, these fascist atrocities occurred because the Chinese newspapers and radio stations "carried out attacks in the most irresponsible tone and manner," which "aroused strong resentment and animosity among the Indonesian people (the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces—Editor's Note)."

    In his statement, Malik once again engaged in the double-dealing tactics of fake friendliness and genuine anti-China sentiments. He hypocritically said: "The Indonesian government, in principle, continues to maintain normal good relations with that country (China)." He then maliciously insinuated that China had "interfered" in Indonesia's internal affairs, saying that Indonesia "hopes to refer to the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, which People's China also signed, especially Article 4, which stipulates that no country shall interfere in the internal affairs of another country."

    Malik's statement also openly rejected the reasonable demands made by the Chinese Foreign Ministry in its note to the Indonesian government on April 12th, namely, that the Indonesian government immediately arrange ships to send back to China the persecuted overseas Chinese who voluntarily wish to return. He arrogantly said that the Indonesian "government is not prepared and has no obligation to provide them (referring to the persecuted overseas Chinese who voluntarily wish to return—Editor's Note) with transportation." "All responsibility must be borne by themselves and the government of the People's Republic of China, which proposed the repatriation."

    According to Western news agencies, Malik said: "The Indonesian government has recently noticed that the US government has a better understanding of Indonesian foreign policy." "The Indonesian government hopes to improve relations with the United States, especially in economic, trade, and technical cooperation." Malik said that Indonesia "government will endeavor to eliminate any doubts about the Indonesian people's desire to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union and cooperate in various fields." "In this regard, the government expresses its deepest gratitude for the Soviet Union's assistance."

    Malik's statement also revealed that the Indonesian right-wing military regime is intensifying its collusion with the Japanese Sato government, Indian reactionaries, and the neo-colonialist tool "Malaysia."

    He said: Indonesia's "economic relations" with Japan "are improving, and efforts are being made to strengthen our relations." He said that the Indonesian "government intends to improve its relations with India and will intensify the study of relations between the two countries." He touted India as "an important country in international politics, especially in the political aspects of Asian-African and non-aligned countries." Malik said that his government "is striving to find a peaceful solution to the Malaysian problem."

### 印尼右派亲美联苏反华的反动面目完全暴露  马利克贼喊捉贼为右派反华暴行狡辩并反诬中国“干涉”内政  公然宣布要同美苏改善关系并同日印“马来西亚”加紧勾结

    印尼右派亲美联苏反华的反动面目完全暴露
    马利克贼喊捉贼为右派反华暴行狡辩并反诬中国“干涉”内政
    公然宣布要同美苏改善关系并同日印“马来西亚”加紧勾结
    新华社十日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚外交部长阿达姆·马利克五日在合作国会全体会议上发表的外交政策声明表明，印度尼西亚右派军人政权正在加紧推行亲美联苏反华的反动外交政策。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，马利克说，“政府已重新研究了迄今为止所奉行的对外政策”，决定采取一种“新态度”。
    马利克颠倒黑白地把“印度尼西亚和人民中国的关系最近面临困难”，归之于“中国不断地攻击印度尼西亚”。他胡说什么中国“公然表明它未能了解”九月三十日运动以来印度尼西亚的事态发展，“人民中国不断地攻击印度尼西亚。这些攻击越来越厉害，公然不顾印度尼西亚的情况。”
    马利克把中国报纸和电台对印度尼西亚右派军人政权疯狂地反共、反人民和反华、排华暴行的报道，说成是对印度尼西亚进行了“不负责任的”、“侮辱性的攻击”，并且企图使人相信，印度尼西亚右派军人政权有组织、有计划地组织和指挥暴徒干下的袭击、捣毁和强占中国驻印度尼西亚外交机构的一系列法西斯暴行，是“可以理解和合乎逻辑的”。按照马利克的荒谬逻辑，所以发生这些法西斯暴行，是因为中国的报纸和电台“用最不负责任的语调和方式进行的攻击”，在“印度尼西亚人民（印度尼西亚右派反动势力——编者注）中间引起了强烈的反感和恶感”。
    马利克在声明中再次玩弄假友好、真反华的两面手法。他假惺惺地说：“印度尼西亚政府原则上继续同那个国家（中国）保持正常的良好关系。”他接着就恶毒地影射攻击中国“干涉了”印度尼西亚的内政，说什么：印度尼西亚“政府希望追述一下人民中国也在上面签字的万隆会议十项原则，尤其是第四条，它规定任何国家都不得干涉他国内政”。
    马利克在声明中还公然拒绝中国外交部在四月十二日给印度尼西亚政府的照会中提出的合理要求，即：印度尼西亚政府立即安排船只把遭受迫害、自愿回国的华侨送回中国。他横蛮地说，印度尼西亚“政府不准备而且毫无义务向他们（指受迫害的、自愿回国的华侨——编者注）提供交通工具。”
  “一切责任必须由他们自己和建议遣返的中华人民共和国政府承担。”
    据西方通讯社报道，马利克说：“印度尼西亚政府最近注意到美国政府对印度尼西亚外交政策有较好的了解。”“印度尼西亚政府希望改善同美国的关系，特别是在经济、贸易和技术合作方面。”马利克说，印度尼西亚“政府将努力消除对于印度尼西亚人民同苏联保持良好关系和在各个领域合作的愿望的任何怀疑”。“在这方面，政府对苏联的援助表示最深切的谢意”。
    马利克的声明还透露，印度尼西亚右派军人政权正在加紧同日本佐藤政府、印度反动派和新殖民主义的工具“马来西亚”勾结。
    他说：印度尼西亚同日本的“经济关系在好转，并且正在努力加强我们的关系”。他说，印度尼西亚“政府打算改善它同印度的关系，并将加紧研究两国的关系。”他吹捧印度“在国际政治方面，特别是在亚非和不结盟国家的政治方面，是一个重要的国家”。马利克说，他的政府“正在努力寻找马来西亚问题的和平解决办法”。
