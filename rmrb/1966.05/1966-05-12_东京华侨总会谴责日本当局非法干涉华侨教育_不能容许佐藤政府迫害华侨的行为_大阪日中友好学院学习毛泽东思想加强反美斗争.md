    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 10th -- The Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association issued an appeal on the 6th, opposing the Sato government of Japan's conspiracy to persecute overseas Chinese schools carrying out national education, and demanding that people from all walks of life in Japan vigorously support the struggle of overseas Chinese in Japan to defend their right to national education.
    The appeal of the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association pointed out that the Japanese government is attempting to use the opportunity of revising the current Education Law to formulate laws regarding "foreign schools." This law is aimed at Korean schools and overseas Chinese schools in Japan, with the purpose of illegally restricting and interfering with these schools and their teaching content.
    The appeal stated that the overseas Chinese schools in Japan are established with funds from overseas Chinese and are democratically managed by them. The purpose of these schools is to conduct patriotic and internationalist education for the children of overseas Chinese, teaching them the language and history of their motherland, and educating them to live in harmony with the Japanese people. Despite this, the Japanese government has unreasonably interfered with overseas Chinese schools in the past. This time, the formulation of laws restricting foreign schools is to legalize this interference.
    According to a disclosure by the Japanese Communist Party's central organ newspaper *Akahata* on the 4th, the "Amendment to the School Education Law Bill" that the Sato government is conspiring to submit to this session of the Diet contains provisions regarding "foreign schools" stipulating that the education of foreign schools in Japan must "maintain coordinated development" with the "interests" of the Japanese ruling clique, in order to interfere with legitimate national education in foreign schools. The bill also blatantly stipulates that Japanese government officials "may enter foreign schools to investigate management conditions, accounts, documents, and other necessary matters."
    In order to oppose the Sato government's enactment of this reactionary law, the vast number of Korean residents in Japan have already launched a powerful protest movement with the support of various democratic groups and people in Japan. Gan Wenfang, Chairman of the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association, also wrote to the Japanese Minister of Education on April 15th, stating that he cannot tolerate the Japanese government's conspiracy to interfere with and persecute overseas Chinese schools.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 11th -- More than 500 members and family members of the Japan-China Friendship Association gathered in Osaka on the 8th to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the founding of the Osaka Japan-China Friendship Academy and the continuous growth of the Osaka Prefectural Federation of the Japan-China Friendship Association.
    Otsuka Yuushou, Director of the Osaka Japan-China Friendship Academy and Director-General of the Osaka Prefectural Federation of the Japan-China Friendship Association, pointed out in his speech that the academy, with Mao Zedong Thought as its main body, has educated and cultivated activists in the Japan-China friendship movement. Students who have studied at this academy are all active in various combat posts.
    Otsuka called on Japanese youth and activists of the Japan-China Friendship Association to make greater contributions to the struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Japanese reactionaries, and to the Japan-China friendship movement.
    The Osaka Prefectural Federation of the Japan-China Friendship Association presented certificates of merit and souvenirs to the lecturers of the academy.
    Graduates of the academy exchanged their experiences in studying Mao Zedong Thought at the meeting. They expressed that they would continuously improve themselves according to Mao Zedong Thought and actively participate in the anti-imperialist struggle.
    The entertainment program performed after the meeting included a living newspaper play "American Imperialism is a Paper Tiger," which showed the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and the heroic spirit of the Vietnamese people in fighting against American imperialism.
    Chen Kang, representative of the Liao Chengzhi Office in Tokyo and director of the China-Japan Friendship Association, was also invited to attend the meeting.

    东京华侨总会谴责日本当局非法干涉华侨教育
    不能容许佐藤政府迫害华侨的行为

    新华社东京十日电　东京华侨总会六日发表呼吁书，反对日本佐藤政府企图迫害旅日华侨学校进行民族教育的阴谋，并且要求日本各界人士大力支持旅日华侨保卫民族教育权利的斗争。
    东京华侨总会的呼吁书指出，日本政府正在企图通过修订现行的教育法的机会而制定关于“外国人学校”的法律。这一法律是针对旅日朝鲜侨民学校和旅日华侨学校的，其目的是为了对这些学校以及教学内容进行非法限制和干涉。
    呼吁书说，在日本的华侨学校都是华侨出钱兴办，并由华侨进行民主管理的。这些学校的目的是向华侨子弟进行爱国主义和国际主义教育，既向他们教授祖国的语文和历史，又教育他们同日本人民友好相处。尽管如此，日本政府在过去对华侨学校进行过无理干涉，这次制定限制外国人学校的法律，就是要使这种干涉合法化。
    据日本共产党中央机关报《赤旗报》四日揭露，佐藤政府阴谋提交这届国会通过的“修改学校教育法法案”中关于“外国人学校”条款的规定，在日本的外国人学校的教育，必须和日本统治集团的“利益”“保持协调发展”，以干涉外国侨民学校进行正当的民族教育。法案并露骨地规定，日本政府官员“可以进入外国侨民学校调查管理状况、账目、文件以及其他必要的事项。”
    为了反对佐藤政府制定这一反动法律，广大旅日朝鲜侨民已经在日本各民主团体和人民的支持下展开了强大的抗议运动。东京华侨总会会长甘文芳也在四月十五日写信给日本文部大臣，表示不能容忍日本政府阴谋干涉和迫害华侨学校的行为。
    新华社东京十一日电　日中友好协会会员和家属五百多人，八日在大阪集会，庆祝大阪日中友好学院创立四周年和日中友协大阪府联合会组织的不断壮大。
    大阪日中友好学院院长、日中友协大阪府联合会理事长大塚有章在讲话中指出，这所学院以毛泽东思想为主体，教育和培养了日中友好运动的积极分子。在这个学院里学习过的学员，都活跃在各个战斗岗位上。
    大塚号召日本青年和日中友协的积极分子，在反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和日本反动派的斗争中，在日中友好运动方面，作出更大的贡献。
    日中友协大阪府联合会向学院的讲师颁发了奖状和纪念品。
    学院的毕业生在集会上交流了学习毛泽东思想的心得。他们表示，要按照毛泽东思想不断地提高自己，积极参加反帝斗争。
    会后表演的文娱节目中，包括“美帝国主义是纸老虎”的活报剧，它表现了日中两国人民的战斗友谊和越南人民打击美帝国主义的英雄气概。
    廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所代表、中日友好协会理事陈抗也应邀出席了这个集会。
