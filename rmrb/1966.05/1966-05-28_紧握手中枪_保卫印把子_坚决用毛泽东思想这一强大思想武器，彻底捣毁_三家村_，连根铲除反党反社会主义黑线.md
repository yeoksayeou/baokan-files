Grasp the Gun Tightly, Defend the Seal of Power
    Resolutely Use Mao Zedong Thought as a Powerful Ideological Weapon to Completely Demolish the "Three-Family Village" and Eradicate the Anti-Party, Anti-Socialist Black Line at the Root
    Wei Xuehong, Party Branch Secretary of Xiaopenyao Brigade, Qinyang County, Henan Province

    The traitor Deng Tuo viciously cursed our great Party for being "self-righteous, looking down on the masses, and not accepting the good opinions of the masses." This is speaking for landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and all class enemies, and it is a complete reversal of black and white, nonsense. Our vast poor and lower-middle peasants and all militiamen will never allow you to slander the great Chinese Communist Party. We will resolutely use Mao Zedong Thought, this powerful weapon, to completely demolish the "Three-Family Village" and eradicate the anti-Party, anti-socialist black line at the root.

    Who really looks up to the people, and who looks down on the people? Who accepts the good opinions of the masses, and who does not accept the good opinions of the masses? We, the broad masses of the people, know much better than you, Deng Tuo. Our great Party and our great leader Chairman Mao have always looked up to the people most, accepted the good opinions of the masses most, and trusted and relied on the people most. The ones who look down on the people most, do not accept the good opinions of the masses most, and fear the people most, are none other than you anti-Party, anti-socialist elements, as well as the ruling class of the old society and imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. If you don't believe it, then let the anti-Party, anti-socialist elements who claim to be "authorities on history" look at the ironclad facts!

    Throughout history, in any dynasty and in any country, whether it is imperialism, modern revisionism, or reactionaries of all countries, the ruling classes have desperately grasped the gun and aimed it specifically at the people, relying on suppression and slaughter to maintain their reactionary rule. Tell me, Deng Tuo, which dynasty's ruling class, which imperialist or modern revisionist country's ruling class, is not like this? Deng Tuo, I ask you again, which dynasty and which imperialist or modern revisionist country's ruling class dares to completely hand over the gun to the people, dares to completely pass on all kinds of military technology to the people? None, absolutely none. Why? Because they are completely opposed to the people. They both look down on the people most and fear the people most. Therefore, they would never dare to hand over the gun to the people.

    Our great Party and our great leader Chairman Mao, however, not only completely hand over the gun to the people, teach all kinds of military technology to the people, but also repeatedly call on the people of the whole country to study diligently and practice hard, and develop superb military skills. Tell me, Deng Tuo, the boss of the "Three-Family Village" black gang, doesn't this fully demonstrate that our great Party looks up to, trusts, and relies on the people most?

    The "masses" that Deng Tuo speaks of are nothing more than a small handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist elements, a small handful of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. The "good opinions" that Deng Tuo speaks of are the "opinions" that you vainly imagine will make our Party step down to "rest," "say nothing, do nothing," and listen to the commands of Deng Tuo and his ilk. Tell you, Deng Tuo, your wishful thinking is wrong. Our vast poor and lower-middle peasants and all militiamen have long made up our minds to always listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, and always follow the Party and Chairman Mao. How can we allow you to sow discord?

    Deng Tuo, tell you! Our great Party truly looks up to the people and completely and thoroughly trusts and relies on the people. The Party and Chairman Mao have not only handed over the gun and all kinds of military technology to us, but also handed over the seal of power to the people. More importantly, the Party has also given us the powerful ideological weapon of how to grasp the gun tightly and how to defend the seal of power—Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, we have full confidence in thoroughly defeating all enemies with guns led by US imperialism, and at the same time, we have the superb ability to subdue demons and completely crush all kinds of monsters and demons without guns. We, the working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, and all militiamen, will resolutely take out the powerful weapon given to us by the Party and Chairman Mao—the great Mao Zedong Thought—aim at the anti-Party, anti-socialist black line, fire a volley of arrows, and fire all cannons, completely demolishing the "Three-Family Village" black den.

    紧握手中枪　保卫印把子
    坚决用毛泽东思想这一强大思想武器，彻底捣毁“三家村”，连根铲除反党反社会主义黑线
    河南省沁阳县小盆爻大队党支部书记　卫学红
    叛徒邓拓恶毒咒骂我们伟大的党“自作聪明，看不起群众，不接受群众的好意见”。这是替地、富、反、坏、右和一切阶级敌人说话，是完全颠倒黑白、胡说八道。我们广大贫下中农和全体民兵，决不允许你污蔑伟大的中国共产党。我们坚决用毛泽东思想这一强有力的武器，彻底捣毁“三家村”，连根铲除反党反社会主义的黑线。
    究竟谁最看得起人民群众，谁最看不起人民群众？谁最接受群众的好意见，谁最不接受群众的好意见？我们广大人民群众比你邓拓清楚得多。我们伟大的党和伟大的领袖毛主席，从来就是最看得起人民群众，最接受群众的好意见，最相信和最依靠人民群众的。最看不起人民群众，最不接受群众的好意见和最害怕人民群众的，不是别人，正是你们这些反党反社会主义分子，以及旧社会的统治阶级和帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派。如果不信，那就请以“史学权威”自居的反党反社会主义分子看看铁的事实吧！
    古今中外，不管哪朝哪代的统治阶级，也不管是帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，他们都是拼命地抓住枪杆子，并专门把枪口对准人民群众，靠镇压和屠杀人民群众来维护他们的反动统治。请问邓拓，哪个朝代的统治阶级，哪个帝国主义和现代修正主义国家的统治阶级，不是这样的呢？邓拓，我再问你，哪个朝代和哪个帝国主义、现代修正主义国家的统治阶级，敢把枪杆子完全交给人民群众，敢把各种军事技术完全传给人民群众呢？没有，根本没有。为什么？因为他们是同人民群众完全处于对立的地位的。他们既最看不起人民群众，也最害怕人民群众。因此，他们说啥也不敢把枪杆子交给人民群众。
    我们伟大的党和伟大的领袖毛主席，却不仅把枪杆子完全交给人民群众，把各种军事技术都教给人民群众，而且还一再号召全国人民必须勤学苦练，练就一身过硬的军事本领。请问“三家村”黑帮的老板邓拓，这不充分说明我们伟大的党是最看得起、最相信和最依靠人民群众吗？
    邓拓所说的“群众”，只不过是一小撮反党反社会主义分子，一小撮地富反坏右分子。邓拓所说的“好意见”，就是你所妄想的要我们党下台“休息”，“什么话都不要说，什么事情都不能做”，一切听从邓拓们指挥的“意见”。告诉你，邓拓，你们的如意算盘打错了。我们广大贫下中农和全体民兵，永远听党和毛主席的话，永远跟着党和毛主席走的决心早就拿定了，岂能容许你们挑拨离间。
    邓拓，告诉你！我们伟大的党是真正看得起人民群众的，是完全彻底相信和依靠人民群众的。党和毛主席不仅把枪杆子和各种军事技术交给了我们，而且还把印把子也交给了人民群众，更重要的是党还交给了我们如何握紧枪杆子，如何保卫印把子的强大思想武器——毛泽东思想。因此，我们既有十足的把握彻底打败以美帝国主义为首的一切拿枪的敌人，同时还有降妖的过硬本领，彻底打垮形形色色的不拿枪的牛鬼蛇神。我们工人阶级、贫下中农和全体民兵，坚决拿出党和毛主席交给我们的强大武器——伟大的毛泽东思想，瞄准反党反社会主义的黑线，万箭齐发，万炮齐鸣，彻底捣毁“三家村”黑店。
