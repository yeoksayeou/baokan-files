    How Can Agricultural Scientific and Technical Personnel Play a Role in National Construction?
    Consciously Study Dialectics Starting from Transforming Worldview
    Jiangsu Agricultural Science and Technology Work Conference Presents Many Facts Showing: Scientific and Technical Workers Who Only Learn Crop Cultivation Methods but Do Not Learn Materialist Dialectics Will Take Detours and Suffer Hardships in Their Work

    (Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing) The Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Science and Technology Work Conference, recently convened, proposed that in order for agricultural scientific and technical personnel to play a role in the development of socialist agricultural science and technology, in addition to carrying out the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology and sweeping away all forms of individualism, they must also arm their minds with materialist dialectics and eliminate metaphysical viewpoints.

    The more than 300 delegates attending the conference presented many facts showing that in the past, only learning crop cultivation methods and not learning materialist dialectics often led to the use of isolated, one-sided, and static ways of thinking to study agricultural science and technology. Some treated temporary and local experiences as universal experiences to be promoted; some mechanically copied experiences from other places, without paying attention to studying local conditions and summarizing local experiences; some studied a single crop in isolation, or a single link in the cultivation techniques of a crop, without paying attention to the internal and external connections between various crops and various technical links, and so on. In this way, living experiences were seen as dead, complex things were seen as simple, and comprehensive techniques were fragmented. They took many detours and suffered many hardships in their work.

    Many delegates said with emotion that things are not isolated in the first place, but if we don't learn dialectics, we always look at problems and conduct research in isolation, only caring about the factors of our own projects, regardless of other related factors, not seeing the internal connections, not seeing the essence of things, so the science and technology researched and summarized is not scientific.

    Subjective one-sidedness in researching problems is a major enemy of scientific and technological work. Many delegates mentioned that without establishing a comprehensive dialectical viewpoint, viewing problems is often all good if one thing is good, and worthless if one thing is bad, so they often blindly apply experiences and lessons from one time and place without considering the conditions. Ye Yongfang, of the Jiangyao Agricultural Technology Promotion Station in Yancheng County, said that he used to only know that low temperature was the main cause of early rice seedling rot, so whenever a cold wave came, he would irrigate with deep water to keep warm, but the seedlings still rotted. Later, he summarized the experience of a local old farmer who had decades of not rotting seedlings, and realized that irrigating with deep water and not draining it for a long time, although it maintained a certain temperature, also caused the seedlings to be hypoxic and suffocate. In this way, with a more comprehensive understanding of the problem of seedling rot, he adopted a moist seedling cultivation method, which solved the contradiction between low-temperature seedling rot and hypoxic suffocation. The delegates realized that looking at problems one-sidedly can only lead to blindly bumping around everywhere, high yield if you happen to hit the right spot, and no high yield if you don't. Only by using dialectics can we look at problems comprehensively and adapt to objective laws.

    The delegates also felt that objective things are constantly developing, especially agricultural production, crops are constantly changing, and the conditions of weather, geography, and people are also constantly changing. People's thinking must adapt to the development of objective things. If things and measures are seen as immutable, then dealing with problems will inevitably fail; only by being good at looking at the sky, the land, and the crops according to the laws of the development of things can we flexibly and dynamically take measures and stand in an invincible position.

    The large amount of vivid situations presented at this conference made the delegates unanimously believe that dialectics is a magic weapon, and scientific farming cannot do without it. The delegates from Suzhou Prefecture said: "If you learn dialectics, you have ways to work; if you leave dialectics, you bump your feet everywhere; if you don't learn dialectics, even experts will become stupid."

    On the basis of clarifying understanding, the conference listened to the speeches of dozens of delegates, who made preliminary attempts to summarize cultivation technology experiences using materialist dialectics, put forward some new insights and viewpoints, and clarified the ways to increase production and the main directions of attack for some crops. Ma Jianqiu, a technician from the Nantong County Agricultural Bureau, used the materialist dialectical viewpoint to scientifically summarize and generalize the technical experience of striving for high cotton yields from three aspects: strategy, tactics, and campaigns. His speech caused a great shock at the conference, and everyone further realized that "those who engage in technology and those who engage in natural science must give prominence to politics and must study philosophy." Materialist dialectics is not mysterious, everyone can learn it, everyone can use it, but to consciously master it and use it, we must start from transforming our worldview. A mind full of personal fame and gain will inevitably be患得患失 (患得患失 is a Chinese idiom that translates to "worrying about personal gains and losses") in scientific research, emphasizing single-item experiments that are easy to become famous, ignoring comprehensive cultivation experiments, only believing in one's own opinions, and not listening to the beneficial suggestions of the masses. One delegate said: "Scientific workers must have the spirit of fighting against themselves, fighting against nature, and fighting against the earth. Only by first defeating ourselves can we dare to fight against the sky and fight against the earth, and only then can we defeat the sky and defeat the earth."

    农业科学技术人员怎样才能在祖国建设中发挥作用？
    从改造世界观入手自觉学习辩证法
    江苏农业科学技术工作会议摆出许多事实说明：科学技术工作者只学作物栽培法，不学唯物辩证法，工作就要走弯路，吃苦头
    新华社南京电　最近召开的江苏省农业科学技术工作会议提出，农业科学技术人员要能够在社会主义农业科学技术的发展中发挥作用，除了进行兴无灭资的斗争，扫清形形色色的个人主义思想以外，还必须用唯物辩证法武装自己的头脑，清除形而上学观点。
    出席这次会议的三百多名代表摆出许多事实说明，过去只学作物栽培法，不学唯物辩证法，往往以孤立、片面、静止的思想方法研究农业科学技术。有的把一时一地的局部经验当作普遍经验来推广；有的死搬硬套外地经验，不注重研究当地的条件和总结当地的经验，有的孤立地研究一项作物，或一项作物的栽培技术中一个环节上的经验，不注意各种作物、各个技术环节的内部和外部的联系，等等。这样，把活经验看死了，把复杂的事物看得简单化了，把综合的技术割裂开来了，工作中走了不少弯路，吃了不少苦头。
    许多代表感慨地谈到，事物本来就不是孤立地存在的，但是我们不学辩证法，就总是孤立地看问题、搞研究，只管本项目的因素，不管与此相关的其它因素，看不到内在联系，看不到事物的本质，这样研究总结起来的科学技术就不科学。
    研究问题的主观片面，是科学技术工作的大敌。许多代表谈到，不树立全面的辩证观点，看问题往往是一好就百好，一差就一文不值，因此常常会不看条件地把一时一地的经验教训乱套乱用。盐城县江窑农业技术推广站的叶永芳说，他过去只知道低温是造成早稻烂秧的主要原因，因此一遇寒流袭来，就灌深水保温，但秧还是烂。后来，他总结了当地一位老农几十年不烂秧的经验，才认识到灌了深水，长期不排，虽然保住了一定的温度，却又造成秧苗缺氧窒息。这样，对烂秧的问题有了较全面的认识，就采用湿润育秧法，解决了低温烂秧和缺氧窒息的矛盾。代表们体会到，片面地看问题，只能是盲目地到处乱碰，碰上就高产，碰不上就不高产。只有用了辩证法，才能全面地看问题，适应客观规律。
    到会代表还感到，客观事物在不断发展，特别是农业生产，作物在不断变化，天时、地利条件也在不断改变，人的思想必须适应客观事物的发展才行。如果把事物、措施看成是一成不变的，那末处理问题就必然失败；只有善于按照事物发展的规律来看天看地看庄稼，才能灵活机动地采取措施，立于不败之地。
    在这次会议上摆出的大量生动的情况，使到会代表一致认为，辩证法是法宝，科学种田少不了。苏州专区的代表说：“学了辩证法，工作有办法；离开辩证法，到处碰壁脚；不学辩证法，专家也要变蠢才。”
    在澄清认识的基础上，大会听取了几十位代表的发言，他们初步尝试用唯物辩证法对栽培技术经验进行了总结，提出了一些新的见解、新观点，明确了一些作物的增产途径与主攻方向。南通县农业局技术员马鉴秋用唯物辩证观点，对争取棉花丰产的技术经验，从战略、战术和战役三个方面进行科学的总结和概括。他的发言在大会上引起很大震动，大家进一步认识到“搞技术的人和搞自然科学的人必须突出政治，必须学习哲学”。唯物辩证法并不神秘，人人可学，人人可用，但是要自觉地掌握它、运用它，就必须从改造世界观入手。满脑子的个人名利思想，在科学研究中就必然会患得患失，重视那些容易成名的单项试验，忽视综合栽培试验，只相信自己的意见，听不进去群众的有益建议。一位代表说：“科学工作者要有斗我、斗天、斗地的精神，只有先斗倒我，才能敢于斗天、斗地，才能斗倒天、斗倒地。”
