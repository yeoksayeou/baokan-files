    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 30th - At a press conference held on the morning of April 30th, the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army announced that in the destructive air raids carried out by American imperialism against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam over the past year, hundreds of American pilots have paid the price for their crimes or have been captured.

    Many captured American pilots have admitted that they encountered fierce anti-aircraft fire from the army and people of North Vietnam. They have begun to realize the unjust nature of the war being waged by American imperialism in Vietnam and have admitted that they have committed crimes against the Vietnamese people.

    The conference also released some confessions of captured American pilots.

    U.S. Air Force Captain Boyd (belonging to the 6234th Air Force Wing stationed in Korat, Thailand), who was captured in Vinh Phu Province, said in his confession: "On April 22, 1966, I was ordered to take off from Korat Airport in Thailand to carry out an air raid on the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. As I approached the target, I was met with intense ground fire. My evasive maneuvers to avoid being hit failed. My plane lost combat capability and kept falling. I parachuted out, and as my parachute approached the ground, a group of people ran towards me with weapons. I was very scared, and escape was impossible. I surrendered immediately."

    U.S. Navy Lieutenant Ratzlaff (belonging to the U.S. aircraft carrier "Enterprise"), who was captured in Ha Tinh Province on March 21, 1966, said in his confession: "This is an unjust war launched by my government." "We dropped many bombs on Vietnamese territory, but in many ways these bombs only strengthened their resolve and hatred."

    U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Risner, of the 18th Air Wing stationed in Thailand, who was captured in Thanh Hoa Province on September 16, 1965, said that on the morning of September 16, 1965, while carrying out an armed reconnaissance mission over the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, "My plane was hit by intense ground fire and burst into flames. I was forced to parachute out and was captured immediately upon landing. … Your tenacious spirit in standing firm against attacking aircraft in the face of cannons, rockets, and bombs has won the admiration of American fighter pilots…"

    越南人民军总部发表被俘美国飞行员供词
    美俘承认越南军民战斗顽强炮火猛烈
    据新华社河内三十日电  越南人民军总司令部在四月三十日上午举行的记者招待会上公布，在美帝国主义一年多来对越南民主共和国进行的破坏性空袭中，已有数百名美国飞行员为他们的罪行付出了代价或被俘。
    被俘的许多美国飞行员承认，他们遭遇到越南北方军民的强烈的防空火力的反击。他们开始认识到美帝国主义在越南进行的战争的不义性质，并承认他们对越南人民犯下了罪行。
    会上还公布了一些被俘的美国飞行员的供词。
    在永福省被俘的美国空军上尉博伊德（属于驻在泰国呵叻的第六二三四空军联队）在供词中说：“一九六六年四月二十二日，我奉命从泰国呵叻机场起飞空袭越南民主共和国，当我飞近目标的时候，遭到猛烈的地面炮火。我想逃避被击中的规避动作失败了。我的飞机失去了战斗力，不断下坠。我跳伞了，当我的降落伞靠近地面的时候，一群人拿着武器向我奔过来。我很害怕，逃跑已不可能。我立刻投降”。
    一九六六年三月二十一日在河静省被俘的美国海军中尉拉茨拉夫（属于美国航空母舰“企业号”），在供词中说：“这是我国政府发动的一场不正义的战争。”“我们在越南的国土上扔了许多炸弹，但是在许多方面这些炸弹只是加强了他们的决心和仇恨。”
    一九六五年九月十六日在清化省被俘的、属于驻在泰国的第十八航空联队的美国空军中校里斯纳说，一九六五年九月十六日上午，在对越南民主共和国执行一次武装侦察任务时，“我的飞机被猛烈的地面炮火击中，燃烧起来。我被迫跳伞，一着陆就被俘了。……你们在大炮、火箭和炸弹面前坚守岗位迎击进攻飞机的顽强精神，博得了美国战斗机飞行员的钦佩……”
