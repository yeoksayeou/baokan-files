    The Sudanese government recently lodged a strong protest with the U.S. government regarding a U.S. military aircraft landing in Khartoum without permission. The Sudanese bi-weekly *21st of October* reported on the 26th that on April 25th at midnight, a U.S. military aircraft landed at Khartoum airport without obtaining permission from the Sudanese authorities. Subsequently, the military attaché of the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum arrived at the airport and requested permission for the passengers to disembark, which was refused by the airport authorities. However, he and some people who accompanied him forcibly allowed the passengers to get off the plane and drove away in a car driven by the U.S. military attaché.

    The Sudanese newspaper *Al-Jamaheer* commented on this incident on the 27th, saying that it demonstrates the extent to which the White House is implementing a "thug" policy in our country. The newspaper said: This ugly policy of the United States is hated by the people of all countries.

    令人痛恨的流氓
    苏丹政府最近就一架美国军用飞机未经准许而在喀土穆降落一事向美国政府提出强烈抗议。苏丹《十月二十一日》双周刊二十六日报道说，四月二十五日午夜，这架美国军用飞机没有得到苏丹当局的许可在喀土穆机场着陆。接着，美国驻喀土穆大使馆的武官来到机场，要求允许乘客下飞机，被机场当局拒绝。但是，他和跟他一起来的一些人使用武力让乘客下飞机，并坐上了美国武官驾驶的汽车强行开走了。
    苏丹《群众日报》二十七日在评论这件事的时候说，这说明了白宫在我国实行“流氓”政策到了什么程度。报纸说：美国的这种丑恶的政策，遭到了各国人民的痛恨。
