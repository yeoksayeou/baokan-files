    Vietnamese *People's Daily* Hails South Vietnamese Liberation Army's Major Annihilation Battles, Crushing US Army's Dry Season Offensive
    South Vietnamese People's War Being Pushed to a New Climax
    Saigon-Gia Dinh and Ba Ria Armies and Civilians Annihilate Over 3,000 US Aggressor Troops in April

    (Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 18) The Vietnamese *People's Daily* published an article on the 18th, discussing the continuous victories achieved by the South Vietnamese Liberation Army in concentrated operations and large-scale annihilation battles.

    The article pointed out that in 1965, the US aggressors dispatched expeditionary forces on a large scale to South Vietnam to directly participate in the war, attempting to defeat the main force of the Liberation Army in a short period. Their strategic conspiracy at that time was: on the one hand, to actively launch large-scale military activities to "find" and eliminate the main force of the Liberation Army; on the other hand, to intensify the violent bombing, so that the Liberation Army would not have a safe rear to concentrate on building up its forces and preparing for large-scale battles. They were confident that these "two fists" combined would bring their war of aggression to a swift conclusion with a decisive victory on the battlefield.

    The article said that the South Vietnamese Liberation Army shattered this absurd American dream. The Liberation Army brought into play the advantages of people's war, resolutely maintained the initiative, and steadily advanced on the road of concentrated operations and large-scale annihilation battles against the US expeditionary forces. The US B-52 strategic bombers could not stop the Liberation Army from concentrating on building up its forces and preparing for large-scale battles.

    The article pointed out that from counter-attacking and defeating the enemy to encircling and annihilating the enemy, the Liberation Army went on to actively lure the enemy out of their fortifications to annihilate them. In the Dong Jia area of ​​Shan Jing, the US troops walked right into a trap and had two battalions and four companies completely wiped out. In the Nha Tho-Peng Zhuang area, the Liberation Army suddenly attacked the enemy's marching troops and completely wiped out an enemy regiment in a few hours... This was an outstanding annihilation battle, marking a new progress in the Liberation Army's level of mobile warfare. At present, the battles to completely annihilate entire battalions of US troops have become a common phenomenon, and the complete annihilation of entire regiments of US troops in a single battle has also occurred several times.

    The article said that the Liberation Army has also made new progress in attacking fortified positions. Although the enemy has actively consolidated bases and bunker fortifications in the dry season, increased troops to strongholds in various places, and tried hard to organize support troops, the Liberation Army is still able to launch fierce attacks on the enemy's strongholds.

    The article also said that the Liberation Army can fight big battles in the mountains and fight them very well; it also fights well on the plains and on terrain that favors the enemy's air and firepower advantages. The Liberation Army can fight big battles at night, and it can also fight big battles during the day.

    The article emphasized that a prominent feature of the Liberation Army in concentrated operations is: vigorously promoting the spirit of heroic and tenacious combat, using bayonets and grenades to fight the US troops in close combat and hand-to-hand combat, throwing the enemy into panic. The enemy could not bring its firepower to bear in support, the enemy's jets were useless, and the artillery became mute.

    The article said that the Liberation Army strengthened its concentrated operations and fought many large-scale annihilation battles in the dry season, giving the US's "most elite" and "most battle-hardened" units decisive blows. In many battles, the US troops immediately fled as soon as they encountered the Liberation Army's attacks.

    The article finally pointed out that the great victories achieved by the South Vietnamese Liberation Army in concentrated operations have shattered the US aggressor bandits' so-called "superiority in troop strength" and bankrupted their "dry season counter-offensive plan." The Liberation Army, in close cooperation and strong assistance from the guerrillas, is pushing the people's war to a new climax, making the American bandits even more chaotic and passive in strategy, campaigns and battles, and unable to escape military defeat.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 19) According to a report by the South Vietnamese Liberation News Agency, the armies and civilians of the Saigon-Gia Dinh area and Ba Ria province in South Vietnam annihilated and disintegrated more than 4,400 enemy troops in April, including 3,016 US aggressor troops.

    The armies and civilians in the Saigon-Gia Dinh area killed and wounded 1,729 US aggressor troops, annihilated and disintegrated 1,165 puppet troops, shot down, shot down, and damaged 122 enemy aircraft, destroyed and damaged 283 enemy military vehicles of various types, sank two enemy warships, and seized a large number of weapons.

    The report said that in April, the people's armed forces in the Saigon-Gia Dinh area, under the guidance of the people's war line, bravely attacked the enemy on various battlefields. The heroic armies and civilians of Gu Zhi County gave the US aggressor troops a severe blow again in April, destroying and damaging hundreds of enemy tanks and amphibious armored vehicles. In the heavily defended city of Saigon, the enemy was also hit one after another.

    The armies and civilians of Ba Ria Province annihilated nearly 1,600 enemy troops in April, including 1,287 US aggressor troops, shot down and destroyed 26 enemy aircraft of various types, destroyed 9 M-113 amphibious armored vehicles and 7 other military vehicles, and seized a large number of weapons, ammunition and military supplies.

    The report said that under the heroic counter-attack of the armies and civilians of Ba Ria Province, the various "sweeps" launched by the American bandits and their lackeys in Ba Ria Province in April suffered disastrous failures. The armies and civilians of Ba Ria Province not only defended the liberated areas, but also wiped out a large number of the enemy's living forces.

    越《人民报》欢呼南越解放军大打歼灭战粉碎美军旱季攻势
    南越人民战争正在推向新的高峰
    西贡—嘉定和巴地军民四月份共歼美国侵略军三千多名
    据新华社河内电　越南《人民报》十八日发表文章，论述越南南方解放军在集中作战和大打歼灭战方面不断取得胜利。
    文章指出，一九六五年中，美国侵略者大规模地派遣远征军到越南南方直接参战，妄图在一个短时期内打败解放军的主力。他们当时的战略阴谋是：一方面积极展开大规模的军事活动来“寻找”和消灭解放军的主力；另一方面加强剧烈的轰炸，使得解放军没有安全的后方来集中建军和准备打大仗。他们满以为这“两个拳头”合起来，它们的侵略战争将以战场上的决定胜利而迅速告终。
    文章说，但是，越南南方解放军粉碎了美国的这个荒唐的美梦。解放军发挥人民战争的优势，坚决保持了主动权，在集中作战和对美国远征军打大规模歼灭战的道路上稳步前进。美国的B—52型战略轰炸机阻止不了解放军集中建军和准备打大仗。
    文章指出，从反攻打败敌人到包围消灭敌人，解放军进而主动地把敌人引到工事外面来消灭它们。在山晶的东甲地区，美军自投罗网，被全歼了两个营和四个连。在芽多—蓬庄地区，解放军突然袭击敌人的行军部队，在几个小时内就全歼敌人一个战团……。这是出色的歼灭战，标志着解放军打运动战水平的新进步。目前，全歼整营美军的战斗已经成为普遍现象，在一次战斗中全歼整个战团的美军也出现了几次。
    文章说，解放军在打攻坚战方面也有了新的进步。尽管敌人在旱季中已经积极巩固基地和碉堡工事，给各地据点增兵，努力组织支援部队，但是解放军仍然能够向敌人的据点展开猛烈的进攻。
    文章又说，解放军在山区能打大仗，并且打得很出色；在平原和在有利于敌人发挥空中和火力优势的地形上，也打得很出色。解放军能够在夜间打大仗，也能够在白天打大仗。
    文章强调指出，解放军在集中作战中的一个突出特点是：大力发扬英勇、顽强的战斗精神，用刺刀、手榴弹跟美军打近战、白刃战，打得敌人惊慌失措。敌人不能发挥火力掩护的作用，敌人的喷气式飞机不顶用，大炮也变成了哑巴。
    文章说，解放军加强集中作战，在旱季打了许多次大歼灭战，给予美国的“最精锐”“最善战”的各部队以决定性的打击。在多次战斗中，美军刚遇到解放军的打击就立即逃跑。
    文章最后指出，越南南方解放军在集中作战中所取得的巨大胜利，已经粉碎了美国侵略强盗的所谓“兵力优势”，并使他们的“旱季反攻计划”遭到了破产。解放军在游击队的紧密配合和大力协助下，正在把人民战争推向新的高峰，使美国强盗在战略、战役和战斗中都更加陷入混乱、被动的处境，无法逃避在军事上的失败。
    据新华社河内十九日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方西贡—嘉定地区和巴地省军民在四月份共歼灭和瓦解敌军四千四百多名，其中歼灭美国侵略军三千零一十六名。
    西贡—嘉定地区军民在四月份共打死打伤美国侵略军一千七百二十九名，歼灭和瓦解伪军一千一百六十五名，击毁、击落和击伤敌机一百二十二架，击毁、击伤敌人的各种军车二百八十三辆，击沉敌战船两艘，缴获大批武器。
    报道说，四月份，西贡—嘉定地区人民武装力量，在人民战争路线的指导下，在各个战场上英勇打击敌人。英雄的古芝县军民，四月份又给予美国侵略军以严重打击，共击毁、击伤敌坦克和两栖装甲车上百辆。在防卫森严的西贡市，敌人也接连挨打。
    巴地省军民四月份共歼敌近一千六百名，其中有美国侵略军一千二百八十七名，击落和击毁各种类型的敌机二十六架，击毁M—113型两栖装甲车九辆和其它军车七辆，缴获大批武器、弹药和军用物资。
    报道说，在巴地省军民的英勇反击下，美国强盗及其走狗四月份在巴地省发动的各次“扫荡”都遭到了惨重失败。巴地省军民不仅保卫了解放区，而且还消灭了敌人许多有生力量。
