    The Revolution of Ballet, the Ballet of Revolution
                 The Ballet "The White-Haired Girl" Gave Us a Profound Education
    Qiu Huiying (Martyr's family member, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union): The Party and Chairman Mao advocate singing revolutionary songs, performing revolutionary operas, and dancing revolutionary dances. Although I am a worker, I also suffered from the oppression of landlords when I was a child. I cried several times while watching the opera. This opera aroused my class hatred. The performance of this ballet is very educational for the working class and the laboring people. It tells us not to forget the past, to always remember the history of suffering of the laboring people, to understand the past, to understand the past, to deeply remember the past, so as to understand that the fruits of victory are not easy to come by, which can better stimulate our love for the motherland and love for the Party. This opera is a class education and revolutionary education for the broad masses of people. Xi'er struggled against nature and reactionary forces in the deep mountains and forests. She did not succumb in that environment, which demonstrated the strong will of the peasants. We must bring this tenacious fighting spirit to our work. We must remember class hatred, so that we can work with more energy.
    Huang Jinliang (Squad Leader of a certain PLA unit, Five-Good Soldier): I used to watch a ballet film once, and my impression was: This ballet was about princes and nobles, floating around, with love and affection, which I couldn't stand at all, and it had nothing to do with our workers, peasants, and soldiers. Now, after watching the ballet "The White-Haired Girl", I can understand it, feel very close to it, and am very moved, which gave me a great education. This is a good opera that strengthens our ambition and weakens the prestige of class enemies. Although Yang Bailao, Xi'er, Dachun and others on the stage did not speak directly, I understand their feelings, what they want to say.
    The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is full of revolutionary passion and comes into the hearts of our workers, peasants and soldiers. After watching this opera, I am even more reminded that there are still thousands upon thousands of "Xi'ers" in Asia, Africa and Latin America living inhuman lives, and two-thirds of the world's laboring people are living in dire straits. I am a revolutionary soldier, and I must be in the company, have the world in my heart, I must practice the skills of killing the enemy, and contribute my life to the complete liberation of the poor people of the world.
    Xu Xiaomei (Veteran worker of Shanghai State Cotton Mill No. 7, Municipal People's Representative): I saw a ballet once in 1957, and I really couldn't get used to it, and I couldn't understand what they were dancing. The veteran workers in our factory didn't like that kind of ballet. This time, I watched the ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" and "The White-Haired Girl" in a row, and I loved them more and more. After the opera was over, I felt that it was too short.
    Speaking of "The White-Haired Girl", we have shown the movie in our factory many times, and we shed tears every time we watch it. This time I was especially excited after watching the ballet. Xi'er's experience is like my own experience. I have endless hatred for the old society and endless love for the new society. After watching "The White-Haired Girl", it reminds me of the past, and I understand today's happiness even more. I have more energy in production, and I must take practical actions to build and defend the new society. Therefore, I think such a good opera should be composed and performed more often. It can remind us not to forget the deep hatred of the past. So that we can see further, see that we still have the responsibility to build socialism and carry out socialist revolution, and the obligation to help class brothers in the world to achieve liberation.

    Highlighted the Revolutionary Character of Chinese Peasants
    Yin A'mei (Member of Yangxing Commune, Baoshan County, Shanghai, Shanghai's first female tractor driver): The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is very successful and very good. This opera reflects the oppression of the broad masses of peasants by the landlords, especially the oppression of the poor and lower-middle peasants by the landlords; it reflects the firm will of the poor and lower-middle peasants, who struggled with the landlords everywhere; it shows the historical truth that the peasants in deep water can only be liberated when the Communist Party and the Liberation Army come. The performance of this opera also shows that only under the leadership of the Party can the peasants be liberated and see our own revolutionary ballet. I saw a foreign ballet in 1959. Their ballet was like noodles, soft and weak, and not very clever. This kind of ballet is for the bourgeoisie, not for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Our own ballet "The White-Haired Girl" reflects the firm will of the poor and lower-middle peasants to dare to struggle. The accompanying singing expresses the feelings of the peasants. The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is constantly revised according to the opinions of the masses. Xi'er is stronger, and Xi'er's father does not die from drinking brine, but is beaten to death by resisting the landlord. This writes out the essence of the character of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Dachun is also successfully portrayed, which shows that the poor and lower-middle peasants must hold the gun firmly in their hands. I compared this opera with my own tragic experience, which played a role in remembering the bitterness and thinking about the sweetness. Therefore, I see it in my eyes and remember it in my heart, compare myself, and never forget class hatred.
    Wang Senming (Militia backbone of Longhua Brigade, Longhua Commune, Shanghai County, Shanghai): After continuous revisions, the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" highlights the class struggle even more. I think this is the outstanding achievement of the adaptation of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl". In the countryside before liberation, there were cases of oppression and suicide like Yang Bailao. But there are also many people who take another path, that is, to rise up and fight. This time, the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" handled Yang Bailao very well. Yang Bailao did not commit suicide, but under intolerable circumstances, he rose up to defend himself, picked up a carrying pole and beat the landlord Huang Shiren severely. As a result, he was beaten to death by the landlord. This treatment is more correct and more profound in portraying the revolutionary character of poor peasants in the Chinese countryside.
    Gao Jinlong (Loading and unloading captain of the Third Loading and Unloading District of Shanghai Port Authority): This opera embodies Chairman Mao's thought. The revolutionary spirit of the Chinese peasants to dare to struggle and dare to win is embodied in Dachun and Xi'er. The Chinese peasants in the past had such fighting spirit. Before, we had a dock worker here, who was originally a peasant. The landlord occupied his wife, and the nursing child starved to death as a result. He was so angry that he called some poor friends and killed the landlord and fled to Shanghai. Now, he is serving as the production team leader in the countryside. This is one of many real-life examples.
    Xu Mingcan (Publicity Officer of a certain Shanghai Public Security Force unit): The directors of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" paid special attention to portraying the positive characters. The positive characters are written very well, and I can't forget them for a long time after watching them. This revolutionary ballet focuses on showing the strong character of Yang Bailao, Xi'er, Dachun and other poor peasants who are "poor in body but rich in spirit", do not bow down to the landlord bullies, and dare to struggle and dare to resist. For example, Yang Bailao dared to pick up a carrying pole and beat the landlord Huang Shiren when he could no longer bear it; Xi'er dared to resist Huang Shiren and Huang's mother even when she was dragged into a den of tigers and wolves. In this way, the image of the positive characters is even taller. This opera also changed the original honest poor peasant Zhao Dazhu to an underground party member, which greatly enhanced the ideological nature of the ballet and also helped the shaping of other positive characters, making the characters more plump and convincing.

    Ballet with accompanying singing is a new initiative
    Han Huiru (Martyr's family member, elementary school principal): The content of ballets performed in Western countries is based on the love between princes and princesses, and the expressions are the same, without joy, anger, sorrow or happiness. They perform "Swan Lake" and the like over and over again. When they come to China to perform, they only have "Swan Lake" and the like. They cannot perform anything else, and they cannot serve the laboring people. Therefore, I am not willing to watch it, and I don't understand it. "The White-Haired Girl" has strong class feelings, and has joy, anger, sorrow and happiness, which makes the laboring people understand it. It is not easy for ballet to do this. You have adopted the form of ballet to serve the laboring people, which greatly encourages us after watching it. The combination of singing and dancing, with both singing and dancing, is a new initiative. In the past, there was only dance, but now adding singing can better express the theme, especially adding singing on several key issues, which makes the audience feel deeply. When singing "I want to live", the audience is very excited, and the emotions of the stage and the audience are integrated. The arrangement of the plot shows the fighting spirit of the laboring people everywhere. When Huang Shiren wants to insult Xi'er, Xi'er also shows the spirit of struggle and resistance, which is very appropriate to remove a section from the movie. The movements can also express emotions. Sometimes, just looking at the movements, you can also understand his emotions. Only Chinese revolutionary ballet can highlight this so prominently.
    Chu Zaiming (Steelmaking worker of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5): We watch operas not only to appreciate art, but also to receive class education. The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is nationalized and popularized, and it is well done. In the past, the costumes of ballet dancers were fixed in tight-fitting clothes with skirts. Now they have been changed, and folk dances have been added, which is very comfortable to watch. I used to think that it was difficult to express some plot content through dance, but now adding accompanying singing makes the plot more moving and more educational.
    Sun Genbao (Huishan Wharf worker): The dance plus accompanying singing in this opera is good, and the music is also well composed. From beginning to end, I can understand it and hear it clearly. When the White-Haired Girl sings "I want to live" in the mountains, my heart is lifted up. After watching it, I feel that class struggle is important. Today we have won, but the class enemies are not reconciled and still want us to live like Xi'er. The bourgeoisie attempts to open a gap in us. We must improve our thinking and do a good job.

    The Result of Studying and Applying Mao Zedong Thought in a Living Way
    Qiu Yunlong (Member of Quanmin Brigade, Xujing Commune, Qingpu County, Shanghai): Some people say that ballet cannot perform the revolutionary struggles of our laboring people. The successful performance of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" proves that this statement is wrong. Putting the heroic image of our poor and lower-middle peasants who dare to struggle and dare to win on the stage of ballet is a great achievement in the revolutionization of ballet. After watching it, I deeply realized that only after being armed with Mao Zedong Thought can we do things that no one has ever done before. I hope that our comrades in ballet will continue to improve and make greater achievements under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought.
    Zhou Jinxin (Soldier of a certain Guard Company): Ballet can also perform modern operas, and workers, peasants, and soldiers have become the new masters of the stage. This is the result of the actors highlighting politics and studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way, and the result of developing the creative spirit of daring to think and dare to act. The successful performance of "The White-Haired Girl" once again tells us: Mao Zedong Thought in command leads to good operas. Only by serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and performing operas for the revolution can art have life. After watching "The White-Haired Girl", I was so excited that I couldn't sleep that night when I returned to the troops. I wrote a poem praising the ballet "The White-Haired Girl", in which two lines were: "Politics in command, ballet blooms new flowers." I hope that ballet dancers will perform modern operas more and more, always serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and let the workers, peasants, and soldiers always become the masters of the stage.

    芭蕾的革命　革命的芭蕾
                 芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》给了我们深刻的教育
    裘慧英（烈属、上海市邮电工会副主席）：党和毛主席提倡唱革命歌曲、演革命戏，还要跳革命舞。我虽然是个工人，但在小时候也受过地主的压迫。看戏时有好几次都掉泪了。这出戏激起了我的阶级仇。这种芭蕾舞的演出，对工人阶级劳动人民教育很深，它叫我们不要忘记过去，要我们永远记住劳动人民受苦受难的历史，了解过去，懂得过去，深深记住过去，从而懂得胜利果实得来不易，这样就更能激发我们热爱祖国、热爱党。这戏对广大人民群众是一次阶级教育，革命教育。喜儿在深山野林里，向自然界、向反动势力作斗争，在那种环境下，她都没有屈服，这正表现了农民的坚强意志。我们要把这种顽强的斗争精神带到工作中去。要记着阶级仇，这样工作起来，才更有劲。
    黄锦亮（解放军某部班长、五好战士）：我以前看过一次芭蕾舞影片，给我的印象是：这种芭蕾舞是将相公子舞，飘来飘去，情来情往，一点也看不顺眼，与我们工农兵毫不相干。现在看了芭蕾舞《白毛女》，看得懂，感到十分亲切、动人，给了我很大教育。这是长我们的志气，灭阶级敌人威风的好戏。虽然舞台上的杨白劳、喜儿、大春等人没有直接说话，但他们的感情，他们想说的话，我是理解的。
    芭蕾舞《白毛女》充满着革命的激情，演到我们工农兵心里来了。看了这个戏，使我更想起亚非拉还有千千万万个“喜儿”过着非人的生活，世界上还有三分之二的劳动人民生活在水深火热之中。我是一个革命战士，一定要做到身在连队，胸怀全球，一定要练好杀敌本领，为天下穷苦人民彻底解放，贡献自己毕生精力。
    许小妹（上海国棉七厂老工人、市人民代表）：一九五七年我曾看过一次芭蕾舞，实在看不惯，也看不懂跳些什么名堂，我们厂里的老工人都不喜欢那样的芭蕾舞。这次连续看了芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》和《白毛女》，却是越看越爱看，戏演完了，还觉得演得太短了。
    说到《白毛女》，我们厂里曾经多次地放过电影，我们看了没一趟不掉眼泪。这次看了芭蕾舞剧，我尤其激动。喜儿的遭遇，就好象是我自己的经历。我对旧社会有说不尽的仇恨，对新社会有说不尽的热爱。看了《白毛女》，就叫我想起了过去，也更懂得了今天的幸福，在生产上干劲就更足，更要用实际行动来建设新社会，保卫新社会。所以，我觉得这样的好戏，应该多编多演。它能叫我们不忘记过去的深仇大恨。好叫自己眼光看得更远，看到自己还有建设社会主义、大搞社会主义革命的责任，还有帮助世界上阶级弟兄取得解放的义务。突出了中国农民的革命性格
    尹阿妹（上海宝山县杨行公社社员、上海第一个女拖拉机手）：芭蕾舞《白毛女》演得很成功，很好。这个剧反映了广大农民受地主的欺压，特别是贫下中农受地主的压迫；反映了贫下中农的坚强意志，处处与地主斗争；表现了在水深火热中的农民只有共产党和解放军来了才能得解放的历史真实。这个戏的演出也说明，只有在党的领导下，农民翻了身，才能看到我们自己的革命芭蕾舞。一九五九年我看过外国的芭蕾舞，他们的芭蕾舞象面条一样，软绵绵的，很不灵光。这种芭蕾舞是为资产阶级着想的，不是为工农兵着想的。我们自己的芭蕾舞《白毛女》反映了贫下中农敢于斗争的坚强意志。伴唱的歌声表达了农民的心情。芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》根据群众意见不断改正，喜儿更坚强了，喜儿的父亲不再是喝盐卤死而是反抗地主被打死，这样就写出了贫下中农性格的本质。大春也演得成功，说明贫下中农手中必须紧握枪杆子。我把这出戏和自己的悲惨经历作对照，起了忆苦思甜的作用。因此，我看在眼里，记在心里，对照自己，永不忘记阶级仇恨。
    王森鸣（上海市上海县龙华公社龙华大队基干民兵）：芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》经过不断修改以后，阶级斗争更加突出了。我认为这是芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》改编的突出成就。解放前的农村里，象杨白劳那种受压迫而自杀的情况是有的。但也有很多人，走另外的道路，那就是起来斗争。这次芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》对杨白劳的处理很好，杨白劳不是自杀，而是在忍无可忍的情况下，起来自卫，拿起扁担痛打地主黄世仁，结果，被地主打死。这样处理对中国农村中贫农革命性格的刻划是比较正确、比较深刻了。
    高锦龙（上海港务局第三装卸区装卸队长）：这出戏体现了毛主席的思想。从大春和喜儿身上体现了中国农民敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神。过去的中国农民就是有这样的斗争性。以前我们这儿有一个码头工人，他原是农民，地主霸占了他的老婆，吃奶的孩子因此活活饿死，他气愤得叫了一些穷朋友，把地主杀死后逃到上海。现在，他在农村担任生产队长。这就是生活中许多真实事例之一。
    徐明灿（上海公安部队某部宣传干事）：芭蕾舞《白毛女》的编导特别注意对正面人物的刻划。正面人物写得很好，使我看完之后，久久不能忘怀。这出革命芭蕾舞剧着重表现了杨白劳和喜儿、大春等贫农“人穷志不穷”，不向地主恶霸卑躬屈膝，敢于斗争，敢于反抗的坚强性格。如杨白劳在忍无可忍时敢于拿起扁担打地主黄世仁；喜儿即使被拖进虎狼窝，也敢反抗黄世仁和黄母。这样，使正面人物的形象更加高大。这个戏还把原来是个正直的贫农赵大叔，改为地下党员，这就大大增强了舞剧的思想性，也有助于其他一些正面人物的塑造，使人物塑造得更为丰满，令人信服。芭蕾舞加伴唱是一个新的创举
    韩慧如（烈属、小学校长）：芭蕾舞在西方国家演出的内容都以王子，公主的爱情为主题的，而表情一样，没有喜怒哀乐。演来演去就是《天鹅湖》之类的东西，来中国演也只有《天鹅湖》之类的东西，他们不可能演别的，也不可能为劳动人民服务，因此，我不愿去看，也看不懂。《白毛女》有强烈的阶级感情，有喜怒哀乐，使劳动人民看得懂，芭蕾舞能做到这点不容易，你们采取了芭蕾舞的形式为劳动人民服务，看后使我们受到很大鼓舞。歌舞结合，有歌有舞，这是一个新的创举。过去只有舞，现在加唱更能抒发主题，特别在几个关键问题上加唱，使观众感受很深，唱到“我要活”时，观众很激动，台上台下感情融为一体。剧情的安排，处处表现了劳动人民的斗争性，当黄世仁要侮辱喜儿，喜儿也表现了斗争反抗精神，舍去电影中的一段，很恰当。动作也能表情，有时只看动作，也能体会到他的感情。这只有中国的革命芭蕾舞才能那么突出表现。
    褚再明（上钢五厂炼钢工）：我们看戏不仅是欣赏艺术，更为了接受阶级教育。芭蕾舞《白毛女》民族化、群众化，化得好。过去芭蕾舞女演员的服装，固定穿的是紧身衣服连裙子，现在改了，还加进了民族舞，看了蛮适意。以前我总认为有些剧情内容用舞蹈来表现比较困难，现在加了伴唱，使剧情更感动人，受教育更深。
    孙根宝（汇山码头工人）：这个戏的舞蹈加伴唱好，音乐创作得也很好。从开始到结尾，看得懂，听得明。当白毛女在山上唱“我要活”时，我的心都吊起来了。看了后，感觉到阶级斗争重要，今天我们胜利了，但阶级敌人不甘心，还想要我们过象喜儿一样的生活，资产阶级企图在我们身上打开缺口，我们一定提高思想，搞好工作。活学活用毛泽东思想的结果
    裘云龙（上海青浦县徐泾公社全民大队社员）：有人说芭蕾舞是不能表演我们劳动人民的革命斗争的，芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的成功演出，证明了这种说法是不对的。把我们贫下中农的敢于斗争，敢于胜利的英雄形象，树立在芭蕾舞的舞台上，这是芭蕾舞剧革命化的大收获。我看过后，深深体会到：只有用毛泽东思想武装起来以后，才能做出前人从来没有做过的事情。希望我们芭蕾舞剧的工作同志，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，精益求精，作出更大的成绩。
    周金鑫（某部警卫连战士）：芭蕾舞也能演现代戏，工农兵成为舞台新主人。这是演员突出了政治，活学活用毛泽东思想的结果，发扬敢想敢作的独创精神的结果。《白毛女》演出成功，再一次告诉我们：毛泽东思想挂帅出好戏。只有为工农兵服务，演戏为革命，艺术才有生命。我看了《白毛女》后，当晚回部队，激动得睡不着，曾作了一首赞芭蕾舞《白毛女》的诗，其中有两句是：“政治挂了帅，芭蕾开新花”。我希望芭蕾舞演员们大演现代戏，永远为工农兵服务，让工农兵永远成为舞台的主人。
