    Chairman Mao's Army is Invincible Under Heaven
    Chairman Mao's army listens to the Party the most, and is an army with clear-cut love and hatred. We support and learn from all thoughts and actions that conform to Mao Zedong Thought; we must expose and criticize without mercy all thoughts and actions that oppose Mao Zedong Thought.
    Zhang Chunli, Representative of the National People's Congress, Combat Hero, Regiment Commander of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region.
    Deng Tuo and a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, while viciously attacking our great Party Central Committee and the General Line, also viciously attacked the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This gang of traitors, waving the "red flag" but speaking in code, dared to provoke the great Chinese People's Liberation Army personally created by Chairman Mao! Such a vicious attack by the likes of Deng Tuo must be met with a head-on blow.
          Chairman Mao's Army Listens to the Party the Most
    Last year, when the *Jiefangjun Bao* reprinted Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article, the editor's note affirmed that *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* was a big poisonous weed that was anti-Party and anti-socialist. This sharp and to-the-point editor's note struck Wu Han and pained Deng Tuo's heart. As the "Three-Family Village's" vanguard Wu Han was exposed, and with the black shop about to be completely revealed, Deng Tuo personally took the field, attempting to resist stubbornly. He vainly attempted to recruit soldiers and buy horses in institutions of higher learning, to win over a batch of tools to serve him, to launch a counterattack against the Party, and to attack the *Jiefangjun Bao* in a big way, saying things like "The *Jiefangjun Bao*'s argument that *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* is a poisonous weed is for internal education within the army; the army cannot engage in debate; we don't care about that." Listen! What an "authoritative" posture. To put Deng Tuo's words clearly, it means that there can be no debate within the army, there is no democracy, we cannot listen to the People's Liberation Army, but must listen to Deng Tuo. May I ask you, Deng Tuo, is it possible that within the People's Liberation Army, *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* is considered a poisonous weed, while among the masses, it can be considered a
  “fragrant flower”? In all walks of life and on all fronts across the country, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, there is only one standard for distinguishing between right and wrong, and that is the stand, viewpoint, and method of Mao Zedong Thought. But you, Deng Tuo, say that the *Jiefangjun Bao*'s statement that *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* is a poisonous weed is only an internal matter of the army. Does this mean that the People's Liberation Army and the people are two different worlds? Your statement is precisely shooting yourself in the foot, exposing your own cloven hoof.
    Deng Tuo, I want to warn you! The *Jiefangjun Bao* is the organ of the Central Military Commission, the mouthpiece of all commanders and fighters of the entire army. To attack the *Jiefangjun Bao* is to attack the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army and the people have an inseparable relationship like fish and water. Deng Tuo wants to slander the People's Liberation Army. Not only will every commander and fighter of the People's Liberation Army not agree, but the people of the whole country will not agree, and the revolutionary people of the world will not agree.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army has developed and grown strong in the flames of class struggle. We know what to love and what to hate. Chairman Mao taught us: Our army has always had two guidelines: first, be ruthless to the enemy, overwhelm them, and eliminate them; second, be kind, united, and harmonious to our own people, to the people, to comrades, to superiors, and to subordinates. In the old society, my family lived by begging and working as hired laborers for generations. My father worked as a hired laborer for the landlord all his life, living a life like a beast of burden. I myself begged from childhood and worked for the Ma family landlord at the age of fourteen, never having enough to eat or wear all year round. Before joining the army, I had never worn a pair of socks or a pair of new shoes. Now that we poor people are in charge and the seals of power and guns are in our own hands, there have been earth-shaking changes, and we are living a happy life. From my own life experience, I have understood who our enemies are, who our friends are, what is truth, and what is fallacy. Chairman Mao taught us: "We must adhere to the truth, and the truth must be clear-cut." Chairman Mao's army listens to the Party the most, and is an army with clear-cut love and hatred. We support and learn from all thoughts and actions that conform to Mao Zedong Thought; we must expose and criticize without mercy all thoughts and actions that oppose Mao Zedong Thought. *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* was originally a big poisonous weed, but you, under the name of "academic issues," are engaging in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. How can the People's Liberation Army not expose and criticize it? *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* is clearly using the past to criticize the present, crying injustice for the right-leaning opportunists who were dismissed from office. Can the people's army still apply rouge and powder to you and help you stir up trouble? *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* was originally a "sugar-coated bullet" attacking the proletariat. Can the People's Liberation Army still allow it to run rampant and paralyze the people? You, Deng Tuo, are still playing tricks, shouting at meetings that Wu Han "cannot be killed with one blow"! No! The eyes of the people are sharp, and the People's Liberation Army is clear about right and wrong. For all the ghosts and monsters who are anti-Party and anti-socialist, not only must they be killed with one blow, but I will also step on them!
            Chairman Mao's Army Values Democracy the Most
    Deng Tuo slanders our army as not having democracy. I say, we are the most democratic army in the world.
    Isn't Deng Tuo and his gang "studying" history? Don't you look at the history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army? The implementation of a democratic system within the army is an important component of our People's Army's founding principles, one of the important factors for our army to win more with less and defeat the strong with the weak, and a brilliant example of Chairman Mao applying Marxist-Leninist principles to the construction of the People's Army. Under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, in every historical period of the Chinese revolutionary war, those erroneous views that our army could not and should not implement democracy have been criticized many times.
    Today, you have come forward again as teachers by negative example, so please look at the historical facts!
    As early as the founding of the Red Army, Chairman Mao stipulated the establishment of democratic life within the Red Army, and organized soldiers' committees in companies, battalions, and regiments. In 1928, Chairman Mao pointed out in his famous article *The Struggle in the Jinggang Mountains*: "The Red Army's material life is so meager, and the fighting is so frequent, yet it can still be maintained without collapse. Apart from the role of the Party, it is also due to the implementation of democracy within the army. Officers do not beat soldiers, officers and soldiers are treated equally, soldiers have the freedom to speak at meetings, cumbersome etiquette is abolished, and finances are made public." It was precisely a complete set of democratic traditions of the People's Army, with political, economic, and military democracy as its content, that guaranteed the victory and development of the Red Army. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, our army inherited and carried forward the glorious tradition of democracy of the Red Army. In the rectification movement of the whole Party and the whole army in 1942, all units, based on the principles of "Say all you know, say it without reservation" and "Those who speak are not guilty, those who hear should take it as a warning" put forward by Chairman Mao, enthusiastically carried out criticism and self-criticism, and the unity between officers and soldiers and between equals was greatly strengthened, and the consciousness of the masses was greatly improved. In the mid-term of the War of Liberation, our army also carried out a movement to pour out grievances and a new-style army rectification movement conducted in a democratic manner. The movement to pour out grievances enabled the broad masses of cadres and soldiers to draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, firmly stand on the class stand, and strengthen their revolutionary will. The new-style army rectification movement purified and consolidated the troops politically, ideologically, and organizationally, and improved the combat effectiveness of the troops. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our army has continued to implement and carry forward the three major democracies in the very revolutionary and very proletarian construction, and in undertaking tasks such as combat, training, production, and construction. In particular, since Vice Chairman Lin Biao proposed to carry out the "Four Goods Company" movement in the whole army in 1960, the democratic tradition has been further developed and carried forward. Within our army, from major policies and operational plans to daily affairs, criticism and praise, are usually decided and acted upon after full deliberation and discussion. Our army truly achieves a political situation where there is both centralization and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unified will and personal ease of mind, and vitality. All these are undeniable facts. Deng Tuo, where can you find a bit of evidence that our "army does not engage in debate" and does not value democracy?
    Deng Tuo, please look at the facts that I have personally experienced! In May 1948, in a battle on the North China battlefield, our company was tasked with the main attack. I was the platoon leader at the time, and our platoon was the assault platoon. In order to fight this battle well, I led the demolition squad leader, the assault squad leader (Comrade Shao Jinshui, the current battalion commander of my unit's Second Battalion), and demolitionist Comrade Liu Jiantang, to climb to a place about twenty meters away from the enemy's front line and held a "Zhuge Liang meeting" to study the tactics. On the enemy's position, there were a group of bunkers composed of three bunkers in front and behind. At first, I wanted to use continuous demolition to take out the big bunker in front first, and then take out the two small bunkers behind. Liu Jiantang raised a different view. He believed that attacking the big one in front first would inevitably attract the attention of the enemy in the small bunkers behind, and they would prepare firepower to deal with us, which would be disadvantageous to us. If we inserted from the flank, took out a small bunker in the middle first, and then used the smoke screen after the explosion to cover us to blow up the big one in front and the small one behind, it would be beneficial to us. In the end, we followed Liu Jiantang's opinion and fought. The battle went very smoothly, and with the cooperation of brother units, we quickly annihilated an enemy regiment.
    There are many such examples. Deng Tuo, I ask you, in the midst of battle, when we were only a few dozen meters away from the enemy, we still fully listened to the opinions of the masses. You say, isn't this the greatest democracy? Isn't the close unity and concerted effort between officers and soldiers and between friendly neighbors in our army a manifestation of the greatest democratic style?
    To tell you the truth: our People's Army values democracy the most, but we cannot talk about democracy with you anti-people and anti-socialist elements. You are only allowed to behave yourselves and not allowed to talk nonsense or act recklessly. Our army is the Party's most obedient tool. We love the Party, love Chairman Mao, and listen to the Party and Chairman Mao. In the past, on the battlefield, facing powerful enemies with guns, we never feared difficulties and resolutely annihilated them completely. Now, when a small handful of ghosts and monsters appear on the ideological front, we are not afraid of difficulties either, and we will resolutely smash you completely. We dare to show the spirit of bayonet fighting and compete with you!
          Chairman Mao's Army Cannot Be Shaken
    Why did Deng Tuo and his gang launch such a vicious attack on the People's Liberation Army? It is because the People's Liberation Army holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, listens to Chairman Mao the most, and resolutely acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions. It is because the People's Liberation Army is not only highly trusted and loved by the broad masses of people at home, but also enjoys a lofty reputation in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world. Therefore, how can all domestic and foreign reactionaries not be frightened when they see that the Chinese Communist Party has such an obedient tool that hates the enemy to the bone and infinitely loves the people? All class enemies understand that to oppose the Party and socialism and to implement class restoration, they must oppose the Party and the people's loyal guards—the Chinese People's Liberation Army. After the *Jiefangjun Bao* affirmed to the readers that *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* was a big poisonous weed, Deng Tuo hurriedly personally took the field and sent a poisonous arrow to the People's Liberation Army. The intention is very clear.
    In order to control and reverse the defeat, to cover up Wu Han, to cover up himself and the entire anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang, Deng Tuo resorted to any means, vainly attempting to pull a batch of young students to serve his criminal activities of opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and attacking the People's Liberation Army. At the symposium of liberal arts students in institutions of higher learning in Beijing, Deng Tuo brandished his teeth and claws, and assigned "combat tasks" to the young students, calling on everyone to "not be afraid of having something in common with Wu Han," and asked the twenty-odd attendees to write at least two or three articles each. What a conspiracy! Three articles per person, and twenty-odd people would have more than sixty articles. By holding these sixty-odd articles supporting Wu Han in his hand, and making each article a "shell," he could bombard them all at once. They thought that if they couldn't beat the People's Liberation Army with martial arts, they would beat the People's Liberation Army with literature. Even if they couldn't beat them down, they could stir up a smoke screen to cover their "safe" retreat. What a wonderful wishful thinking, what a good "combat deployment"! But no matter whether you have thirty-six plans or seventy-two plans, you cannot escape from the net of the people.
    I want to warn Deng Tuo that your plan to deceive a batch of young students in institutions of higher learning is wrong. The Chinese youth who have grown up nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought will not be fooled by you. Your use of peaceful evolution to corrupt the youth is also a waste of effort. Your vain attempt to shake the People's Liberation Army is more difficult than shaking Mount Tai. The People's Liberation Army can withstand martial arts and literary arts. In the past, it defeated the enemy with guns, and today it will resolutely defeat the enemy without guns. The black shop you have painstakingly run has been declared bankrupt, and your gang of black thugs has fallen into the heavy encirclement of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country.
    Chairman Mao taught us, "After the enemies with guns have been eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist. They will inevitably fight us to the death, and we must never underestimate these enemies." Throughout the entire socialist stage, the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism runs through it. From the crimes of this small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements like Deng Tuo, I have received a profound lesson in class struggle from the negative side, which has made me more deeply aware of the brilliance of Chairman Mao's teachings. In order to guarantee socialist construction and prevent the restoration of revisionism, we must hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in this socialist cultural revolution, and, together with the people of the whole country, completely smash the frenzied attacks of the anti-Party and anti-socialist forces, and carry the socialist cultural revolution through to the end.

专栏：

    毛主席的军队是无敌于天下的
    毛主席的军队是最听党的话的，是爱憎分明的军队。凡是符合毛泽东思想的一切思想和行动，我们就拥护它，学习它；凡是反对毛泽东思想的一切思想和行动，我们就要毫不留情地揭露它，批判它
    全国人民代表大会代表、战斗英雄、北京部队某部团长　张春礼
    邓拓等一小撮反党反社会主义分子，在恶毒地攻击我们伟大的党中央，攻击总路线的同时，还恶毒地攻击了中国人民解放军。这伙打着“红旗”讲黑话的叛徒，竟敢向毛主席亲自缔造的伟大的中国人民解放军进行挑衅！对邓拓之流的这种恶毒进攻，必须给以迎头痛击。
          毛主席的军队最听党的话
    去年《解放军报》转载姚文元同志的文章时，编者按语肯定地指出了《海瑞罢官》是一株反党反社会主义的大毒草。这篇一针见血的按语，打在吴晗的身上，痛在邓拓的心里。“三家村”急先锋吴晗的暴露，眼看黑店即将全部露底，邓拓于是亲自上阵，企图负隅顽抗。他妄想在高等院校中招兵买马，拉拢一批为他服务的工具，向党进行反扑，并对《解放军报》进行大肆攻击，说什么“《解放军报》论《海瑞罢官》是株大毒草，是军队内部搞教育，军队内部不能搞争鸣，我们不管那些”。听！好一副“权威”的架势。把邓拓的话说得清楚一点，就是部队内部不能搞争鸣，没有民主，我们不能听解放军那一套，而要听我邓拓这一套。请问邓拓，难道在解放军内部认为《海瑞罢官》是一株大毒草，而在人民群众当中，就可以认为它是一朵
  “香花”吗？全国各行各业，各条战线，都是在党和毛主席领导下，对一切是非辨别，也只有一个标准，那就是毛泽东思想的立场、观点、方法。而你邓拓却说《解放军报》说《海瑞罢官》是一株毒草，只是军队内部的事，难道人民解放军与人民群众是两个天下吗？你的这种说法，恰恰是搬起石头砸自己的脚，暴露了你们自己的马脚。
    邓拓，我要警告你！《解放军报》是中央军委的机关报，是全军指战员的喉舌，你攻击《解放军报》就是攻击中国人民解放军。人民解放军与人民群众有着鱼水不可分离的关系，邓拓要污蔑解放军，不仅解放军的每个指战员不答应，全国人民不答应，全世界的革命人民也不答应。
    中国人民解放军是在阶级斗争的烈火中发展和壮大起来的。我们懂得该爱什么，恨什么。毛主席教导我们：我们的军队一向就有两条方针：第一，对敌要狠，要压倒它，要消灭它；第二，对自己人，对人民，对同志，对官长，对部下要和，要团结。在旧社会，我的家是祖祖辈辈靠要饭、扛长工过活的，我的父亲替地主扛长工，过了一辈子牛马生活。我自己也是从小要饭，十四岁就给马家地主扛活，一年到头，不得温饱。参军前，我还没有穿过一双袜子，穿过一双新鞋。如今我们穷人当家作主了，印把子、枪杆子掌握在我们自己的手里，才有天翻地覆的变化，过着幸福的生活。从自己的身世中，我懂得了谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友，什么是真理，什么是谬论。毛主席教导我们：“我们必须坚持真理，而真理必须旗帜鲜明。”毛主席的军队是最听党的话的，是爱憎分明的军队。凡是符合毛泽东思想的一切思想和行动，我们就拥护它，学习它；凡是反对毛泽东思想的一切思想和行动，我们就要毫不留情地揭露它，批判它。《海瑞罢官》本来就是一株大毒草，而你们打着“学术问题”之名，干着反党反社会主义的勾当，解放军能不揭露不批判吗？《海瑞罢官》明明是借古非今，为罢了官的右倾机会主义分子喊冤叫屈，人民的军队还能替你们涂脂抹粉，帮你们兴风作浪吗？《海瑞罢官》本来就是向无产阶级进攻的“糖衣炮弹”，解放军战士还能让它自由泛滥、麻痹人民吗？你邓拓还一再耍把戏，在会议上叫喊对吴晗“不能一棍子打死”，不！人民群众的眼睛是雪亮的，解放军是是非分明的，对于反党反社会主义的一切牛鬼蛇神，不但要一棍子打死，我还要踩上一脚哩！
            毛主席的军队最讲民主
    邓拓诬蔑我军没有民主。我说，我们是世界上最讲民主的军队。
    邓拓一伙不是“研究”过历史的吗？难道你们不看看中国人民解放军的历史？在军队内部实行民主制度，是我们人民军队建军原则的重要组成部分，是我军以少胜多、以弱胜强的重要因素之一，也是毛主席以马克思列宁主义原理运用于人民军队建设的光辉范例。在党和毛主席的正确领导下，在中国革命战争的各个历史时期，那些认为我们军队不可能、不应该实行民主的错误观点，已经受到过多次的批判。
    今天，你们又作为反面教员站出来了，那么，请你们看看史实吧！
    早在红军创建时期，毛主席就规定在红军内部建立民主生活，在连、营、团内组织士兵委员会。一九二八年，毛主席在《井冈山的斗争》那篇著名文章中指出：“红军的物质生活如此菲薄，战斗如此频繁，仍能维持不敝，除党的作用外，就是靠实行军队内的民主主义。官长不打士兵，官兵待遇平等，士兵有开会说话的自由，废除烦琐的礼节，经济公开。”正是政治、经济、军事三大民主为内容的一整套人民军队的民主传统，保证了红军的胜利和发展。抗日战争时期和解放战争时期，我军继承和发扬了红军这种民主的光荣传统。一九四二年全党全军的整风运动，各部队根据毛主席提出的知无不言，言无不尽和言者无罪，闻者足戒的原则，热烈地开展了批评与自我批评，官兵之间、同级之间的团结大大增强了，群众的觉悟大大提高了。解放战争中期，我军又开展了以民主方式进行的诉苦运动和新式整军运动。诉苦运动使广大干部和战士划清了敌我界线，站稳了阶级立场，坚定了革命斗志。新式整军运动，在政治上、思想上和组织上纯洁和巩固了部队，提高了部队的战斗力。建国以来，我军在非常革命化、非常无产阶级化的建设中，在担负作战、训练、生产、施工等任务中，仍然贯彻和发扬三大民主。特别是一九六○年林彪副主席提出在全军开展创造四好连队运动以来，民主传统进一步发扬光大。我军内部，大到方针政策、作战计划，小到日常事务，批评表扬，通常都是经过充分酝酿讨论，然后作出决定，采取行动的。我们军队，真正做到又有集中又有民主，又有纪律，又有自由，又有统一意志，又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的政治局面。所有这些都是无可辩驳的事实。邓拓，你们从哪里能找到一星一点我“军队内部不能争鸣”不讲民主的根据？
    邓拓，再请你看看我个人经历过的事实吧！一九四八年五月，在华北战场一次战斗中，我们连担任主攻，我当时任排长，我们排是突击排。为了打好这个战斗，我带领爆破班长、突击班长（我部现在的二营营长邵金水同志），爆破手刘建堂同志，一起爬到离敌前沿二十来米的地方，开起了“诸葛亮会”，研究打法。在敌人阵地上，前后有三个碉堡组成的碉堡群。起初，我想用连续爆破的方法，先干掉前面的大碉堡，再干掉后面两个小碉堡。刘建堂提出不同的看法，他认为先干前面大的，必然会引起后面小碉堡里敌人的注意，他们会准备火力对付我们，这对我们不利，如果从侧翼插入，先干中间一个小碉堡，乘爆破后的烟幕掩蔽，再爆破前面一个大的和后面一个小的，对我有利。最后，我们照刘建堂的意见打，战斗进行的很顺利，在兄弟部队的配合下，很快歼灭敌一个团。
    象这样的例子很多。邓拓，我问你，在战斗进行中，我们离敌人只几十米的地方还充分听取群众意见，你说，这不是最大的民主是什么？我军官兵之间、友邻之间如此亲密团结，协同一致，这不是最大的民主作风的体现，又是什么？
    老实告诉你：我们人民军队内部是最讲民主的，而对你们这帮反人民反社会主义的分子则不能讲民主。只许你们规规矩矩，不许你们乱说乱动。我军是党的最驯服的工具，我们热爱党、热爱毛主席，听党和毛主席的话。过去，在战场上，面对拿枪的强大敌人，我们从不畏难，坚决把他们彻底消灭。现在，在思想战线上出现你们一小撮牛鬼蛇神，我们也不畏难，坚决把你们彻底粉碎。我们敢于拿出拼刺刀的劲头来和你们较量！
          毛主席的军队是撼不动的
    邓拓一伙为什么对解放军进行如此恶毒的攻击呢？不是别的，是因为人民解放军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，最听毛主席的话，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事。是因为人民解放军不仅在国内受到广大人民群众的高度信任和爱戴，而且在世界革命人民的心目中也享有崇高的威望。所以一切国内外反动派看到中国共产党有这样一支对敌人恨之入骨，对人民无限热爱的驯服工具，怎能不为之心惊胆战呢？一切阶级敌人都懂得，要反党反社会主义，实行阶级复辟，都必须反掉党和人民的忠诚卫士——中国人民解放军。《解放军报》向读者肯定了《海瑞罢官》是一株大毒草之后，邓拓急忙亲自上阵，向解放军发出一支毒箭，用意是非常清楚的。
    邓拓为了控制和扭转败局，掩护吴晗，掩护自己和整个反党反社会主义的黑帮，不择手段，妄图拉一批青年学生为他反党反社会主义，攻击人民解放军的罪恶活动服务。邓拓在北京市高等院校文科学生座谈会上，张牙舞爪，向青年学生布置“战斗任务”，号召大家“不要怕与吴晗有共同之点”，要求二十多位到会者，每人起码写两三篇文章。好一个阴谋诡计，每人三篇，二十几个人就有六十多篇，把这六十多篇支持吴晗的文章拿在手，篇篇都是“炮弹”，将它一下子轰出去。他们以为武打打不过解放军，文打也要把解放军打垮，即使打不垮也可以搅起一阵烟幕，掩护自己“平安”撤退。多妙的一个如意算盘，多好的一个“战斗部署”！但是不管你是三十六计还是七十二计，在人民群众这个天罗地网里，你是逃不脱身的。
    我要警告邓拓，你企图在高等院校中欺骗一批青年学生的算盘打错了。在毛泽东思想哺养下成长起来的中国青年，是不会上你当的。你用和平演变的手法，腐蚀青年，也是枉费心机。你妄想撼动解放军，那是比撼动泰山还难。人民解放军是经得起武打，也经得起文打的，过去打垮了拿枪的敌人，今天也坚决打垮不拿枪的敌人。你苦心经营的黑店已宣告破产了，你们一伙黑帮已陷入全国广大工农兵群众的重重包围之中了。
    毛主席教导我们，“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”在整个社会主义阶段，贯穿着社会主义和资本主义这两条道路的斗争。从邓拓这一小撮反党反社会主义分子罪行中，从反面给我上了一堂深刻的阶级斗争课，使我更深刻地认识到毛主席教导的英明。为了保证社会主义建设和防止修正主义复辟，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极参加这一场社会主义文化大革命，和全国人民一道彻底粉碎反党反社会主义的猖狂进攻，把社会主义文化大革命进行到底。
