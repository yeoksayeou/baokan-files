    Firmly Remember Class Hatred
    Ren Chengshui, Postal Worker, Hebei Township, Fangshan County
    Wu Han said: “Emperors, kings, generals, and ministers played a leading role in history,” that poor and lower-middle peasants “accomplished nothing in their lives,” and that peasant wars played no role. This is all nonsense. History is created by us, the working people. Emperors, kings, generals, and ministers were supported by our working people. Without the working people, none of the emperors, kings, generals, and ministers Wu Han praises could have survived. The grain eaten, the silk and satin worn, and the golden palaces lived in by emperors, kings, generals, and ministers were all created by our ancestors, the working people. Take the Dunhuang murals and the Great Wall, for example; these are also the great creations of our working people. Wu Han ignores these facts, yet says that the working people accomplished nothing in their lives, truly turning black into white.
    Look again at the working people after liberation. Under the leadership of the Party, how many earth-shattering achievements have been made! I won’t mention the well-known major events, but just take the mountain valley of Hebei Township, where I deliver mail! I have been running this route for fourteen years, and I know clearly the enormous changes in each village here. Our mountainous areas here are all slopes; in the past, there was not a single mu of irrigated land. Every summer, when there were floods, the Dashi River rushed down, washing away the soil. After 1958, we established pumping stations and diverted the water of the Dashi River to the high mountains. As the saying goes, "water flows downwards," but now here, "water flows upwards." Our irrigated land now accounts for more than 60 percent, and the highest yield per mu of grain has increased from more than one hundred jin before liberation to more than six hundred jin. Our postal and telecommunications traffic here has also undergone great changes. Before liberation, Fangshan County had only two and a half "mail carriers" (two counties sharing one). Now, every village is connected by mail routes. In the past, one couldn't see a single car in the mountains; now, roads have been built, and cars are in teams, passing by our post office every five minutes. Who says our working people accomplished nothing in their lives? Wu Han insists that the working people "accomplished nothing in their lives," his purpose being nothing more than to fight for a historical position for landlords, old masters, and the bourgeoisie, and to stage another reactionary restoration.
    We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, had no property, no land, no farm implements before liberation. What was the reason? Wasn't it because landlords and capitalists drank the blood and squeezed the oil of the people, leaving the poor "with nothing"? Yet Wu Han says that Bao Gong and Hai Rui, these landlord-official masters, were the people’s "great saviors," and that having a few more Hai Ruis and Bao Qingtians could save the common people. This is deceiving people. My family has been poor for generations, working as hired laborers for generations. Since I was a child, I herded sheep for the landlords, running barefoot all day long, driving the flocks across the mountains and fields. I worked from dawn till dusk every day, never getting a full meal all year round, and I never saw any official master show kindness. Take Hebei Township, for example. In 1943, when there was a famine, the common people fled to other places to escape the famine, selling their children. In Xinzhuang Village alone, out of more than 120 households, 70 or 80 fled. Had any official master saved them? We, the working people, understand that all crows under the sky are equally black, and all landlords under the sky are equally ruthless. They will never show kindness. We poor people can only be liberated through revolution. Our ancestors never resigned themselves to oppression. For many years, in order not to be oppressed, they launched countless peasant wars. It was not until the Chinese Communist Party led us in decades of revolution, overthrowing the three great mountains, that we were liberated and lived a good life.
    We, the working people, understand that reactionary things will not fall unless you strike them down; the broom will not sweep away the dust unless it reaches it. We can only overthrow reactionary rule and liberate ourselves through revolution. Wu Han, seeing us praise peasant wars and expose the crimes of emperors, kings, generals, and ministers, says that we are portraying our ancestors as bad people. This is truly nonsense. We must distinguish clearly, whose ancestors are emperors, kings, generals, and ministers? Emperors, kings, generals, and ministers, these big landlord bosses, are not the ancestors of us, the working people; they are the ancestors of Wu Han and his ilk. Revolutionary working people are our ancestors! We must enthusiastically praise revolutionary working people, thoroughly expose the crimes of emperors, kings, generals, and ministers who oppressed and exploited the people, educate our children to firmly remember class hatred, and carry the class struggle through to the end.
    After studying Chairman Mao’s writings, we have become even more clear-sighted. No matter what tricks you play, what sweet words you use, or what deceptive tactics you employ, we will not be fooled by you. We can recognize what is fragrant flower and what is poisonous weed. If we discover poisonous weeds, we must uproot them.

    牢牢记住阶级仇恨
    房山县河北镇乡邮员  任成水
    吴晗说：“在历史上起主导作用的是帝王将相”，贫雇农“一辈子没有什么成就”，农民战争起不了作用，这全是胡说。历史是我们劳动人民创造的，帝王将相是靠我们劳动人民养活的。没有劳动人民，吴晗所颂扬的帝王将相一个也活不成。帝王将相吃的粮食，穿的绫罗绸缎，住的金銮宝殿，都是我们祖先劳动人民创造的。就拿敦煌壁画、万里长城来说，也都是我们劳动人民的伟大创造。吴晗不看这些事实，却说劳动人民一辈子没什么成就，真是颠倒黑白。
    再看看解放后的劳动人民，在党的领导下，创造了多少惊天动地的事业！人人皆知的大事我不说，就拿我走的河北镇这条山沟来说吧！我已经跑了十四年，对这里每个村庄的巨大变化知道得清清楚楚。我们这里的山区都是山坡地，过去没有一亩水浇地，一到夏天发大水，大石河急流而下，还把泥土冲走了。一九五八年后我们建立了扬水站，把大石河的水引到了高山上。俗话说，“水往低处流”，现在我们这里“水往高处流”了。我们的水浇地已占百分之六十以上，每亩粮食的最高产量已由解放前的一百多斤增加到六百多斤。我们这里的邮电交通也有很大变化。解放前房山县只有两个半“邮差”（两个县合一个）。现在每个村庄都通了邮路。过去山区看不见一辆汽车，现在修起公路，汽车成队，每五分钟从我们邮局门口就过一辆。谁说我们劳动人民一辈子没成就。吴晗硬说劳动人民“一辈子没成就”，其目的无非是要为地主老爷、资产阶级争历史地位，要再来个反动统治复辟。
    我们贫雇农，在解放前没有财产，没有土地，没有农具，是什么原因？还不是地主资本家喝了人民的血，榨了人民的油，弄得穷人“一无所有”。而吴晗却说包公海瑞这些地主官老爷是人民的“大救星”，多出几个海瑞，包青天，就可以救老百姓，这是骗人。我们家辈辈受穷，辈辈当长工。我从小给地主放羊，整天光着脚满山遍野地赶着羊群跑，天天从早累到晚，一年到头吃不上一顿饱饭，也没见过那个官老爷发过善心。拿河北镇来说，一九四三年闹灾荒，老百姓出外逃荒卖儿卖女，辛庄一个村一百二十多户出去逃荒的就有七、八十户。有过那个官老爷救过他们？我们劳动人民懂得，天下乌鸦一般黑，天下地主一样狠，他们永远不会发善心，我们穷人要解放只有革命。我们的祖先从来就不甘心受压迫，多少年来，为了不受压迫曾掀起过无数次的农民战争。一直到中国共产党领导我们闹了几十年革命，推翻了三座大山，才得到了解放，过上了好日子。
    我们劳动人民懂得，反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。我们只有革命，才能推翻反动统治，解放自己。吴晗看见我们歌颂农民战争，揭露帝王将相的罪恶，就说是把我们的祖宗说成坏人，真是胡说八道。我们得分清楚，帝王将相是谁的祖宗？帝王将相，这些大地主头子不是我们劳动人民的祖宗，那是吴晗一伙人的祖宗。革命的劳动人民才是我们的祖宗！我们要热情歌颂革命的劳动人民，彻底揭露帝王将相压迫剥削人民的罪恶，教育我们的子孙牢牢记住阶级仇恨，把阶级斗争进行到底。
    我们学习毛主席著作以后，更加心明眼亮了。不管你耍什么花腔，用什么甜言蜜语，摆什么迷魂阵，我们都不会叫你迷住。我们能够识别什么是香花，什么是毒草，发现毒草就要把它连根拔掉。
