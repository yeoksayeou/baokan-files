    Xinhua News Agency, May 18th – Representatives of workers, peasants, and herdsmen of various minority nationalities visiting the capital recently held a forum, angrily criticizing the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of Deng Tuo and his gang of black bandits.

    The participants in the forum included workers, poor and lower-middle peasants (herdsmen), and grassroots cadres from the front lines of production, representing thirty-one ethnic components from fifteen provinces and autonomous regions, including Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Guangxi, Ningxia, Tibet, Jilin, Guizhou, etc. They unanimously stated in the forum that they were determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, destroy the "Three-Family Village" black inn, and carry the socialist cultural revolution through to the end.

    Han Chugela, Mongolian chief of the Wushen Zhao Commune in the Uxin Banner of the Ikezhao League, Inner Mongolia, questioned Deng Tuo in the forum: Did the Party and Chairman Mao lead us to overthrow the Kuomintang reactionaries and the rule of princes, smash the feudal system, liberate us from the dark hell, turn us slaves into masters, and lead us onto the broad road of socialism, enabling us to live a happy life? Is this "bragging"? The Mongolian people, thanks to the great Mao Zedong Thought, holding high the three red banners, and using the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, have transformed a place that could not even produce a needle in the past into a modern large-scale iron and steel industry, machinery manufacturing industry, livestock product processing industry, and daily necessities industry, turning a backward and desolate Inner Mongolia into an advanced and prosperous Inner Mongolia. Is this "bragging"? Our people of Wushen Zhao, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with the revolutionary spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountain, have transformed the historically famous "Maowusu" Desert into oasis after oasis with lush water and grass, increasing the number of livestock from 19,000 at the beginning of liberation to more than 82,000 now. Is this also "bragging"? He said, you viciously attack the Party and Chairman Mao, we must, like eradicating drunken horse grass (a poisonous weed on the grassland), uproot you, a gang of demons and monsters, together with the old roots of your "Three-Family Village" black inn!

    Aji Silamu, Uyghur deputy leader of the Fourth Company of the No. 308 Road Construction Team of the Transportation Department of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, said that class enemies will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history. The class enemies with guns have been eliminated, but Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and other class enemies without guns are still fighting us. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, people of all ethnic groups must deeply carry out this life-and-death class struggle and resolutely defeat the frenzied attacks of the enemies without guns!

    Huang Meixiu, Zhuang deputy squad leader of the backbone militia of the Changzhou Commune, Fengshan County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, said that the gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist black bandits of the "Three-Family Village" promoted the idea that there were "honest officials" in the ruling class of the old society, and portrayed executioners as "good officials" who pleaded for the people's lives and promoted their interests. This is with ulterior motives. All officials in the old society oppressed and exploited the people and worked for the ruling class. Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, how deeply were our poor and lower-middle peasants oppressed and exploited! They levied exorbitant taxes, arrested people, and seized grain, and burned down the houses of the poor and lower-middle peasants in our village three times, but never burned down the houses of the two landlords and rich peasants. Deng Tuo and his gang do not want our poor and lower-middle peasants to stand up, they vainly attempt to restore capitalism, oppose the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the general line of socialist construction, vainly attempt to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat, and dismantle the socialist stage! This is a dream! We have long seen through the reactionary nature of the class enemies. Your lies cannot deceive us! Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party, our poor and lower-middle peasants will surely defeat all demons and monsters!

    Ma Shude, Hui deputy secretary of the Party Committee of the Haojiaqiao Commune and political instructor of the Cuiqu Brigade, Lingwu County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, angrily rebuked Deng Tuo for promoting the idea that the feudal ruling class "cared for labor power." He said that the feudal ruling class not only relied on the cruel exploitation of the working people to maintain its reactionary rule and lived a licentious and shameless parasitic life, but also had the working people buried alive with the emperor after his death. Is this the feudal ruling class "caring for labor power"? The feudal emperor spent decades and hundreds of thousands of laborers to build a tomb for himself, and after it was completed, he viciously killed these people. Is this also the feudal ruling class "caring for labor power"? Deng Tuo tried his best to whitewash the feudal ruling class, dreaming of restoring reactionary rule.

    Ma Shude also said that Deng Tuo viciously attacked our Great Leap Forward as "boasting," "telling big lies," and "bumping their heads and bleeding." However, ironclad facts have shattered his lies. It is precisely because of the Great Leap Forward that our country has undergone earth-shaking changes. Take our Ningxia for example. Before liberation, there was no modern industry. After liberation, under the shining light of the Party and Chairman Mao's ethnic policies and under the guidance of the general line of socialist construction, iron and steel plants and hydropower stations have been built, and large areas of cultivated land have appeared, with crisscrossing ditches and complete drainage and irrigation systems. Our Hedong area, which used to be a saline-alkali depression where "black donkeys rolled around and white donkeys got up," has now become a stable and high-yield granary, with surplus grain in every household and a large amount of collective grain reserves. The development in cultural education, medical and health care, and transportation is endless. Are all these "bragging" and "telling big lies"? Is it "the property of an egg"? The great glory of the general line shines brightly in all directions. No matter how Deng Tuo and his gang rack their brains, exhaust their efforts, and adopt various despicable means to slander the Great Leap Forward, it will not damage the glory of the Great Leap Forward in the slightest. They can only lift a stone to drop it on their own feet.

    Suolang Zhaxi (Tibetan), People's Representative of the Tibet Autonomous Region and secretary of the Party branch of Tongga Township in Duilongdeqing County, pointed out in the forum that Deng Tuo and his gang, like the reactionary serf owners in Tibet, are the sworn enemies of the Tibetan people. He said that Deng Tuo viciously cursed our Party and wildly called for our Party to step down and "rest." These words are the same as those of the Tibetan traitor Dalai and the Panchen who conspired to betray the country in cursing our Party. Although Deng Tuo and the Dalai and Panchen are not in the same place and are not of the same ethnicity, their reactionary nature has made them unanimous in opposing the Party, the people, and socialism. They are all the sworn enemies of our people of all ethnic groups. As the saying goes: "When a wolf is sleeping, it still thinks about eating people." This shows that although class enemies have long been overthrown by us, they are not willing to die, and they will launch attacks on us at every opportunity. We must be vigilant at all times and fiercely fight back.

    Jin Donglie, Korean secretary of the Party General Branch of the Youyi Brigade in the Wulin Commune, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, said that Deng Tuo viciously scolded our Party for "going back on its word and being untrustworthy," which fully exposed his reactionary nature. He and our poor and lower-middle peasants are deadly enemies. It is precisely because our Party did not allow Deng Tuo and his gang's conspiracy to drag China onto the capitalist road to succeed, but instead carried the socialist revolution through to the end according to the will of the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants, that they slandered our Party as "untrustworthy." We want to solemnly warn Deng Tuo and this small group of people: In the past, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we were able to remove the three great mountains, and today we can also remove this pile of garbage! Thoroughly smash the "Three-Family Village" black inn you opened!

    Chen Yongyuan (Miao), secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the Xinyun Brigade, Yangchang Commune, Longli County, Guizhou Province, said that the landlords and capitalists are inherently determined to oppress and exploit the people. How can they serve the people? In the past, there was a landlord named Liao in our township who demanded that poor people carry him when he went out. We poor people were not even allowed to enter the landlord's gate. How could such a bad guy serve the people! Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and others vainly attempted to restore the landlord and capitalist class, which we will never allow. Our poor and lower-middle peasants must master the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely fight them to the end.

    He Minggang, a former slave and the Yi chief of the Machangping Advanced Cooperative in Deyu Township, Puge County, Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, said that Deng Tuo insulted us for suffering from "amnesia." However, under the education of the Party, we firmly remember the tragic experiences in the slave society, never forget that there is still class struggle in socialist society, and never forget the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao. Our Liangshan was still a slave society before liberation. My family of five were all slaves. I was a child laborer for more than ten years and suffered all kinds of torments from the slave owners. I was sold twice. There are more than just me suffering like this? There are thousands upon thousands in the entire Liangshan and in China. We were liberated from the slave society only after the democratic reform. Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and the like, are on the same side as the slave owners, landlords, capitalists, and revisionists. Their opposition to the Party, the people, and socialism is determined by their class nature. We must overthrow them.

    Li Liu, Lahu secretary of the Party branch of the Shangyun Township, Shangyun District, Lancang Lahu Autonomous County, Yunnan Province, said that in the socialist period, class struggle is long-term. From 1959 to 1961, Deng Tuo and his gang of black bandits used the cultural front as their stronghold to launch a frenzied attack on the Party. The reactionary chieftains, landlords, and rich peasants in our area were also using singing folk songs to oppose the Party and socialism. In order to control the cultural front, they tried their best to prevent the children of poor and lower-middle peasants from going to school and vigorously promoted the idea that "if you don't become a monk, you won't go to heaven after death." It seems that Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and the reactionary fellows in our area, and the foreign reactionaries, are all on the same side.

    These facts have made me realize that although culture is not a gun, it is sometimes more powerful than a gun. The class enemies have precisely seen this point and are desperately launching attacks on the Party and socialism from the cultural front. If we working people want to firmly defend our country and engage in socialist construction, we must fight to the end against anti-Party and anti-socialist elements such as Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha.

    Wu Jifu, Oroqen accountant of the Xinsheng Brigade, Xinsheng Commune, Aihui County, Heilongjiang Province, said that no matter what tricks Deng Tuo and his gang play and what "academics" and "knowledge" they use as shields, they cannot cover up their reactionary nature. Our Oroqen people are hunters. No matter how cunning you are, even more cunning than foxes, you cannot escape the hunter's eyes. You will not succeed in trying to muddle through. Your purpose is to vainly attempt to abolish Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, realize revisionism in China, and engage in capitalist restoration. Our broad masses of working people will never allow this. Our workers, peasants, and soldiers must actively participate in this struggle, thoroughly smash the "Three-Family Village" black inn, and eliminate all demons and monsters!

    He Xingye (Manchu), deputy secretary of the Party branch of the Jiayun Brigade, Lanqi Commune, Fengcheng County, Liaoning Province, said that Deng Tuo wrote anti-Party articles such as "Defending Li Sancai," Wu Han wrote anti-Party articles such as "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," and together they spoke out for the right-leaning opportunists. Bad films such as "The City Under Siege," "Forcibly Conscripting Soldiers," and "Two Stage Sisters," etc., vigorously whitewashed the bourgeois feudal ruling class and promoted class reconciliation. The class struggle on the cultural front is very sharp. We clearly see that for more than ten years, the bourgeoisie and revisionism in literary and art circles and the so-called literary and art monsters of the 1930s have formed a black line that opposes the Party and socialism, openly opposes Mao Zedong Thought, and wants to destroy our socialism. In order to defend our country, the Party, and socialism, our poor and lower-middle peasants must resolutely throw ourselves into the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and, under the leadership of the Party, thoroughly destroy the black line and eradicate the poisonous weeds!

    Fu Xueli, Li chief of the Baoyou Commune, Ledong County, Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Guangdong Province, said that Deng Tuo and his gang praised Hai Rui and Li Sancai to appeal for grievances on behalf of right-leaning opportunists, which is to insult the Party and Chairman Mao. They have deep-seated hatred for the Party and socialism, want to destroy the Party's leadership, destroy the dictatorship of the proletariat, destroy socialism, and even want to prevent us from speaking. The broad masses of our Li people had no food or clothing before liberation. Today, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao led us to a great turnaround. They are the real saviors of our Li people. Deng Tuo and his gang still want to use so-called cultural and historical knowledge to engage in "peaceful evolution." They miscalculated! We have invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary power of the broad masses. Under the leadership of the Party, our minority peoples must carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deeply and thoroughly. We will never withdraw our troops until you are completely defeated.

### 彻底捣毁“三家村”黑店  把文化大革命进行到底  来京参观的少数民族工农牧民代表愤怒批判邓拓黑帮的反党反社会主义言行

    彻底捣毁“三家村”黑店
    把文化大革命进行到底
    来京参观的少数民族工农牧民代表愤怒批判邓拓黑帮的反党反社会主义言行
    新华社十八日讯　来首都参观的我国各少数民族工农牧民代表，最近举行座谈，愤怒批判邓拓等一伙黑帮的反党反社会主义言行。
    参加座谈的，有来自生产第一线的工人、贫下中农（牧）和基层干部，包括内蒙古、新疆、广西、宁夏、西藏、吉林、贵州等十五个省、自治区的三十一个民族成分。他们在座谈中一致表示，决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，摧毁“三家村”黑店，把社会主义文化大革命进行到底。
    内蒙古伊克昭盟乌审旗乌审召公社蒙古族社长韩楚格拉在座谈中质问邓拓：党和毛主席领导我们推翻了国民党反动派和王公的统治，打碎了封建制度，把我们从黑暗的地狱里解放出来，使我们奴隶变成了主人，走上了社会主义的康庄大道，过上了幸福生活，难道这是“说大话”吗？我们蒙古族人民，由于有伟大的毛泽东思想，高举三面红旗，用自力更生、奋发图强的精神，使一个过去连一根针都不能生产的地方，有了现代化的大型钢铁工业、机械制造业、畜产品加工工业和生活用品工业，把一个落后荒凉的内蒙古变成了一个先进繁荣的内蒙古，难道这是“说大话”吗？我们乌审召人民，高举着毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以愚公移山的革命精神，把一个历史上有名的“毛乌素”沙漠，改造成为一片又一片水草丰美的绿洲，使牲畜从解放初的一万九千头发展到现在八万二千多头，难道这也是“说大话”吗？他说，你们恶毒地攻击党和毛主席，我们一定要象铲醉马草（草原上的一种毒草）一样，把你们这伙牛鬼蛇神连同你们“三家村”黑店的老根一起铲掉！
    新疆维吾尔自治区交通厅三○八筑路队第四连维吾尔族副连长阿吉斯拉木说，阶级敌人是不会自动退出历史舞台的。拿枪的阶级敌人被消灭了，邓拓、吴晗这些不拿枪的阶级敌人还在同我们斗争。我们各族人民要在党和毛主席的领导下，深入开展这场你死我活的阶级斗争，坚决打垮不拿枪的敌人的猖狂进攻！
    广西壮族自治区凤山县长洲公社基干民兵壮族副班长黄美秀说，“三家村”的一伙反党反社会主义黑帮分子，宣扬旧社会的统治阶级里有“清官”，把刽子手说成是为民请命、为民兴利的“好官”。这是别有用心的。旧社会所有的官都是欺压和剥削人民，为统治阶级卖力的。在国民党反动派统治下，我们贫下中农受的压迫、剥削有多深呵！他们派苛捐杂税，抓人抢粮，曾经三次把我们村贫下中农的房子烧光，单单不烧那两家地主、富农的。邓拓一伙不想让我们贫下中农翻身，妄想让资本主义复辟，反对党中央、毛主席，反对社会主义建设总路线，妄想取消无产阶级专政，拆社会主义的台！这是梦想！阶级敌人的反动本性，我们早就看透了。你们的鬼话骗不了我们！在毛主席和党的领导下，我们贫下中农一定要战胜一切牛鬼蛇神！
    宁夏回族自治区灵武县郝家桥公社党委副书记兼崔渠一大队回族政治指导员马树德在座谈中怒斥邓拓宣扬封建统治阶级“爱护劳动力”。他说，封建统治阶级不但靠着残酷地剥削劳动人民来维护它的反动统治，过着荒淫无耻的寄生生活，而且帝王死了以后，还要劳动人民陪葬，这难道是封建统治阶级“爱护劳动力”吗？封建皇帝用几十年时间、几十万劳动力为他建造坟墓，在建成之后，竟穷凶极恶地把这些人杀掉，难道这也是封建统治阶级“爱护劳动力”吗？邓拓千方百计地为封建统治阶级涂脂抹粉，是梦想反动统治复辟。
    马树德还说，邓拓恶毒地攻击我们的大跃进是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”、“碰得头破血流”。但是，铁的事实粉碎了他的谎言，正是由于大跃进，我们的国家起了翻天覆地的变化。就说我们宁夏吧，解放前没有现代化工业。解放后在党和毛主席的民族政策光辉照耀下，在社会主义建设总路线的指引下，如今已修起了炼铁厂、炼钢厂、水电站，还出现了大面积的园田，沟渠纵横，排灌配套。我们河东地区，过去是“黑驴打滚白驴起”，十种九不收的盐碱洼地，如今变成了稳产高产的米粮川，家家有余粮，还有大量集体储备粮，在文化教育、医疗卫生、交通运输等方面的发展，写不完，唱不尽。所有这些，难道这是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”吗？是“一个鸡蛋的家当”吗？总路线的伟大光辉如日月高悬普照四方。不管邓拓一伙怎样挖空心思，费尽心机，采取各种卑劣手段来诋毁大跃进，都丝毫无损于大跃进的光辉，他们只能搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    西藏自治区人民代表、堆龙德庆县通嘎乡党支部书记索郎扎西（藏族）在座谈中指出，邓拓一伙和西藏反动农奴主一样，是西藏人民的死敌。他说，邓拓恶毒地咒骂我们党，猖狂地叫我们党赶快下台“休息”。这些话，同西藏叛国头子达赖和阴谋叛国的班禅咒骂我们党一样。邓拓和达赖、班禅，虽然不在一个地方，也不是同一个民族，但是，他们的反动本性，使他们在反党、反人民、反社会主义这一点上，一致起来了，他们同是我们各族人民的死敌。俗话说：“狼在睡觉的时候，还想着吃人”，这说明，阶级敌人虽然早被我们打倒了，但是不甘心死亡的，一有机会，它就要向我们发动进攻。我们要时刻警惕，狠狠地回击。
    吉林省蛟河县乌林公社友谊大队党总支书记、朝鲜族金东烈说，邓拓恶狠狠地骂我们党“自食其言，不堪信任”，这就充分暴露了他的反动本质，他和我们贫下中农是死对头。正是因为我们党没有使邓拓一伙企图把中国拉上资本主义道路的阴谋得逞，而是按工人阶级、贫下中农的意志把社会主义革命进行到底，所以他们才污蔑我们党“不堪信任”。我们要严正警告邓拓这一小撮人：过去我们在党和毛主席的领导下，能够搬掉三座大山，今天就同样能够清除你们这堆垃圾！把你们开的“三家村”大黑店彻底捣毁！
    贵州省龙里县羊场公社新云大队团支书陈永元（苗族）说，地主、资本家本性就是要压迫、剥削人民的，怎能为人民办事？从前，我们乡有个姓廖的地主，出门就要穷人抬他，我们穷人连地主的门都进不得。这样的坏家伙哪能替人民办事！邓拓、吴晗等妄图地主资产阶级复辟，我们决不允许。我们贫下中农要掌握毛泽东思想的锐利武器，坚决同他们斗争到底。
    四川省凉山彝族自治州普格县德育乡马厂坪高级社社长、彝族翻身奴隶何明刚说，邓拓辱骂我们害了“健忘症”，可是，在党的教育下，我们牢记着在奴隶社会的悲惨遭遇，永远忘不了在社会主义社会还有阶级斗争，永远忘不了党和毛主席的恩情，我们凉山，解放前还是个奴隶社会，我家五口人，都是奴隶。我当了十几年的娃子，受尽了奴隶主的折磨。被卖过两次。象我这样的受苦人何止一个？全凉山、全中国有千千万万。实行了民主改革，我们才从奴隶社会里解放出来。邓拓、吴晗之类，是和奴隶主、地主资产阶级、修正主义一鼻孔出气的。他们反党反人民反社会主义是由他们阶级本性决定的，我们非把他们斗垮不可。
    云南省澜沧拉祜族自治县上允区上允乡党支部书记、拉祜族李六说，在社会主义时期，阶级斗争是长期存在的。一九五九年至一九六一年，邓拓这伙黑帮分子以文化阵地为据点，疯狂地向党进攻。而我们那里的反动头人，地主富农，也在利用唱山歌来反党反社会主义。他们为了把持文化阵地，竭力阻挠贫下中农子弟上学，大事宣传：“不当和尚死后上不了天。”看来，邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙和我们那里的反动家伙、和国外反动派，都是一鼻孔出气的。
    这些事实使我认清了：文化虽不是枪，但有时它比枪还厉害，阶级敌人正是看准了这点，才拼命地从文化战线上来发动对党对社会主义的进攻。我们劳动人民要坐稳江山，要搞社会主义建设，一定要跟邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙等反党反社会主义分子斗争到底。
    黑龙江省爱辉县新生公社新生大队鄂伦春族会计吴吉福说，任凭邓拓一伙耍什么花招，用什么“学术”呀、“知识”呀作护身符，也掩盖不住他们的反动本质。我们鄂伦春族是打猎的，任凭你们比狐狸还狡猾，也逃不出猎人的眼睛，你们想蒙混过关是办不到的。你们的目的是妄想取消马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，在中国实现修正主义，搞资本主义复辟，我们广大劳动人民是决不允许的，我们工农兵要积极参加这场斗争，彻底捣毁“三家村”大黑店，铲除一切牛鬼蛇神！
    辽宁省凤城县兰旗公社甲云大队党支部副书记何兴业（满族）说，邓拓写《为李三才辩护》等反党文章，吴晗写《海瑞罢官》《海瑞骂皇帝》等反党文章，共同替右倾机会主义分子鸣冤叫屈，坏影片《兵临城下》《抓壮丁》《舞台姐妹》等大毒草，大肆为资产阶级封建统治阶级涂脂抹粉，搞阶级调和。文化战线上的阶级斗争，是十分尖锐的。我们清楚地看到：十多年来文艺界的资产阶级、修正主义和所谓三十年代文艺等等牛鬼蛇神，构成了一条反党反社会主义的黑线，明目张胆地反对毛泽东思想，要想搞垮我们的社会主义。我们贫下中农为了保卫自己的江山，保卫党和社会主义，必须坚决投入到文化大革命中去，在党的领导下，彻底摧毁黑线，铲除毒草！
    广东省海南黎族苗族自治州乐东县抱由公社黎族社长符学利说，邓拓一伙人捧出海瑞，捧出李三才，是为右倾机会主义分子喊冤叫屈，是辱骂党和毛主席。他们对党对社会主义有刻骨的仇恨，想搞垮党的领导，搞垮无产阶级专政，搞垮社会主义，还想不让我们说话。我们黎族广大人民解放前没吃没穿，今天党中央和毛主席领导我们大翻身，是我们黎族人民的真正救星。邓拓一伙人还想利用所谓文化、历史知识搞“和平演变”，他们估计错了！我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，有广大群众的革命力量。我们在党的领导下，我们少数民族人民一定要把文化大革命搞深搞透，不彻底打垮你们，决不收兵。
