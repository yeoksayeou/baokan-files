    Thoroughly Smash the Anti-Party, Anti-Socialist "Three-Family Village" Black Shop
    Shanghai Workers, Peasants and Soldiers Symposium Minutes
    "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" have long vigorously promoted anti-Party, anti-socialist black goods. After the exposure of the anti-Party elements of the Deng Tuo gang, these two newspapers played tricks again, attempting to cover up their crimes. This cannot deceive the broad masses of workers, peasants and soldiers. The vast numbers of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Shanghai are filled with righteous indignation, unanimously denouncing and determined to overthrow the ringleaders of the "Three-Family Village" black shop, thoroughly criticize the Yanshan black talks, thoroughly eliminate this big poisonous weed, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end.
  Deng Tuo Sings the Same Tune as Khrushchev
    Chen Zhifeng, a fitter and five-good worker from the Shanghai Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory, an advanced Daqing-style unit, said: Deng Tuo blatantly launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism, which makes us very angry. His attack on the Party and socialism is an attack on the cause of our working class, a challenge to the 600 million people of the country. We are determined to defeat this counter-revolutionary offensive! Judging from Deng Tuo's remarks, he is exactly the same as the Khrushchev revisionists in attacking our Party. In fact, they are on the same wavelength, and Deng Tuo is a modern revisionist! Deng Tuo妄想 (wangxiang - vainly hopes) for the restoration of capitalism in China; this is a daydream. The Chinese working class and the Chinese people, educated by the Party and Chairman Mao, will never allow it. We must expose his conspiracy and resolutely repel his attack! Our Shanghai working class has a glorious tradition of revolutionary struggle. We have fought against imperialism and reactionaries for more than a hundred years. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we achieved victory. After liberation, the Party and Chairman Mao led us again in a resolute struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. Our working class is fully capable of defeating this small handful of anti-Party elements like Deng Tuo!
    Wang Guibao, a locomotive driver from the Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant, an advanced Daqing-style unit, said: Deng Tuo's reactionary nature is very clear. Deng Tuo echoed the class enemies at home and abroad, and echoed revisionism, attacking the Party Central Committee with extreme insidiousness. When Khrushchev revisionism shouted that the Chinese Communist Party had messed things up, Deng Tuo echoed by saying that the Party had "stumbled and fallen." When revisionism attacked the Chinese Communist Party for being "hot-headed," Deng Tuo echoed by saying that the Party had "rising deficiency fire (虚火上升 - xuhuo shang sheng)." Deng Tuo also viciously satirized the famous thesis of Chairman Mao that "the East Wind prevails over the West Wind" by sarcastically talking about "East Wind." If we allow these demons and monsters to continue like this, China will change its color, and the Marxist-Leninist party will become a revisionist party. How dangerous that would be! We must fight to the end against this gang of enemies who don't carry guns like Deng Tuo!
    Jin Yuli, the electrical transport team leader of Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant, said: Deng Tuo wants to take the revisionist road. He is a power-holding figure within the Party, the boss of the "Three-Family Village" black shop, sheltering and organizing a group of anti-Party elements such as Liao Mosha and Wu Han to attack the Party. He used the newspapers and periodicals he controlled to launch a large number of poisonous arrows, directly attacking the Party Central Committee and Mao Zedong Thought. In a short period of one and a half years, he wrote as many as 150 "Yanshan Black Talks," releasing poison every three or four days on average, to poison the working people and youth. He slandered our Party as "blind" and himself as a "passer-by," urging our Party to heed his advice. If we were to truly heed his advice, then China would change its color. Deng Tuo is a thoroughgoing revisionist. In his 150 "Yanshan Black Talks," every piece quoted moldy stories. Now that we have uncovered those disguises, his claws are exposed. No matter who you are, as long as you oppose the Party Central Committee and oppose Mao Zedong Thought, you are our class enemy, and we must resolutely fight you to the end!
    Shen Yinlong, an inspector and five-good worker from the Shanghai Qiuxin Shipyard, said: Chairman Mao taught us that anything reactionary, if you don't strike it down, it won't fall. If the anti-Party, anti-socialist activities of people like Deng Tuo are not thoroughly exposed and thoroughly criticized, there will be endless troubles. Just when our country encountered temporary economic difficulties a few years ago, Deng Tuo and his gang took the opportunity to cooperate with revisionism and other reactionary forces to launch an attack on the Party. In "Yanshan Evening Talks," he talked about "taking advantage of the fire to rob" and "attacking in the east and striking in the west," which means taking advantage of the fire of revisionists and reactionaries to scold the Communist Party, attack socialism, and use the mouths of ancient people to oppose the Party and oppose socialism. Our working class absolutely will not allow it. We, the working class and the laboring people, must defend the Party, defend socialist construction, carry the socialist revolution through to the end, and thoroughly smash their black shop.
      Dig Out the Old Roots of Poisonous Weeds
    Xuan Zhendong, the Party branch secretary of the Pingmin Brigade of the Xuhang Commune in Jiading County, Shanghai, said: Listening to the broadcast exposing Deng Tuo's anti-Party, anti-socialist black talks twice this morning made me angrier the more I listened. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are always thinking of us working people, but Deng Tuo hates it to death and is determined to carry out capitalist restoration. That's just a daydream! Deng Tuo is "demolishing the wall from within," digging at our foundations from inside. This is extremely vicious and extremely dangerous. He is an old party member, an old cadre, trying to intimidate people. He gesticulated, drawing an "anti-blueprint." If we were to build a house according to his blueprint, what would be built must be capitalist, with landlords and capitalists enjoying happiness, and us peasants suffering. Deng Tuo slanders us as "money-grubbers," with only "a home with the possessions of one egg." What kind of talk is this? Our country is "poor and blank," with a thin foundation. We are listening to Chairman Mao's words, striving to be strong and self-reliant, and building socialism. In the past, landlords looked down on us poor and lower-middle peasants, scolding us for "wanting to open a large dye shop with three coins' worth of dye." Deng Tuo's words are exactly the same as the landlords! We must overthrow this gang of anti-Party, anti-socialist bad people like Deng Tuo!
    Ji Dezhang, a Shanghai agricultural labor model and a member of the Xuhang Commune in Jiading County, said: Deng Tuo's words are anti-Party, anti-socialist black talks, which cannot see the sunlight. Taking the facts in our rural areas, there are three accounts that cannot be forgotten after liberation: the first account is the political emancipation account, from slaves becoming masters. I myself went from being a hired hand to becoming a people's representative of the city. The second account is the production development account, just like "sesame flowers blooming higher and higher." Before liberation, our Yangjia Village had a yield of three to four hundred jin per mu, but now one mu yields more than a thousand jin. The third account is the improvement of living standards account. In the past, out of the thirty-six households in our Yangjia Village, thirty-two households had no dinner after breakfast. Now, the average income of the entire commune is one hundred and fifty-six yuan per person. How did this come about? The commune members said: of thousands of paths, the leadership of the Communist Party is the most important. Deng Tuo, you slander the Party Central Committee as "blind," but we see that you are a thorough "blind man." Standing on a reactionary position, you can't even see the facts in front of your eyes. "Three-Family Village" is a "Three-Harm Village." Deng Tuo is the "village chief" of "Three-Harm Village," the root of the poisonous weed. When we peasants dig out weeds, we always dig out the roots, and now we must dig out this old root!
      Fight to the End Against the Enemy Who Doesn't Carry a Gun
      Wang Fuquan, the deputy squad leader of the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," said: Chairman Mao said that after the enemy with guns is eliminated, the enemy without guns still exists. Deng Tuo is this kind of enemy who doesn't carry a gun. We, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, are here to defend socialism. No matter who he is, as long as he is anti-Party and anti-people, we must use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon and fight him to the end. Deng Tuo's writing is strange and tortuous. On the surface, it may not be immediately apparent what he is talking about, but when illuminated by Mao Zedong Thought, his fox tail cannot be hidden. I am a son of a poor and lower-middle peasant. In the past, we suffered all the exploitation and oppression of the exploiting classes. Deng Tuo妄想 (wangxiang - vainly hopes) to restore capitalism and allow the exploiting classes to come back to power. It cannot be done!
    Shen Guijin, the squad leader of the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," said: Deng Tuo is the spokesperson of the bourgeoisie, an accomplice of imperialism. In 1962, when the anti-China chorus of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries was at its loudest, Deng Tuo was also very "busy," writing many articles attacking our Party, singing in chorus and cooperating with demons and monsters at home and abroad. Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the banner of liberation for the oppressed people, but Deng Tuo slanders the Party and slanders Mao Zedong Thought. This is the manifestation of their reactionary class instinct. The people of the whole country support the Party's general line for building socialism. Precisely because of the general line, our country overcame the serious difficulties caused by natural disasters and achieved an all-round economic recovery in just three years. All this shows the correctness of the Party's leadership. Deng Tuo turns a blind eye to the facts and sings the same tune as Khrushchev. Now, Deng Tuo has been exposed. This is a serious class struggle. These facts educate us young people not to forget class struggle. We must resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words. We must fire at Deng Tuo and his gang, expose him severely, and let him tremble in the roar of the workers, peasants, and soldiers!
    Teng Changyu (new soldier) said: Deng Tuo is a criminal against the Party and socialism. We must crusade against him and overthrow him. In 1962, when Chiang Kai-shek was attempting to counterattack the mainland, he also took the opportunity to borrow from the past to satirize the present, opposing the Party and opposing socialism, and in essence, was taking the same path as Chiang Kai-shek. He was building a bridge for Chiang Kai-shek, helping Chiang Kai-shek. Such a person is a "roadblock" on our revolutionary path. We must knock down the roadblock.

### 彻底打垮反党反社会主义的“三家村”黑店

    彻底打垮反党反社会主义的“三家村”黑店
    上海市工农兵座谈纪要
    《前线》和《北京日报》，长期以来大力推销反党反社会主义的黑货。这两家报刊在邓拓一伙反党分子面目暴露以后，又大耍花招，企图掩盖他们的罪行。这是蒙蔽不了工农兵群众的。上海市广大工农兵义愤填膺，一致声讨，决心打倒“三家村”黑店的头目，彻底批判燕山黑话，彻底除掉这棵大毒草，把社会主义革命进行到底。
  邓拓同赫鲁晓夫唱一个调子
    大庆式先进单位上海永鑫无缝钢管厂钳工、五好工人陈志丰说：邓拓明目张胆地向党向社会主义发动猖狂的进攻，我们十分气愤。他攻击党，攻击社会主义，就是攻击我们工人阶级的事业，就是向全国六亿人民挑战，我们坚决要打垮这场反革命的进攻！从邓拓的言论看，他跟赫鲁晓夫修正主义者攻击我们党完全一模一样。实际上，他们是一个鼻孔出气，邓拓就是一个现代修正主义者！邓拓妄想资本主义在中国复辟，这是白日做梦。党和毛主席教导出来的中国工人阶级和中国人民决不允许，一定要揭穿他这个阴谋，坚决打退他这场进攻！我们上海工人阶级有光荣的革命斗争传统，我们跟帝国主义、反动派作了一百多年的斗争。在党和毛主席的领导下，我们才取得了胜利。解放以后，党和毛主席又领导我们，跟帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，进行了坚决的斗争。我们工人阶级完全有力量打垮邓拓这一小撮反党分子！
    大庆式先进单位上海杨树浦发电厂机车司机王贵宝说：邓拓的反动本质十分清楚。邓拓和国内外的阶级敌人相呼应，和修正主义相呼应，极端阴险地攻击党中央。赫鲁晓夫修正主义大叫中国共产党搞糟了，邓拓就应声说党“失足坠地”。修正主义攻击中国共产党“头脑发热”，邓拓就应声说党“虚火上升”。修正主义攻击毛主席“东风压倒西风”的著名论断，邓拓也恶毒地讽刺“东风”。如果听任他们这些牛鬼蛇神这样搞下去，中国就要改变颜色，马列主义的党就要变成修正主义的党，是多么危险啊！我们一定要和邓拓这伙不拿枪的敌人斗争到底！
    上海杨树浦发电厂电运班长金玉莉说：邓拓要走的是修正主义道路。他是党内当权派，是“三家村”黑店的老板，包庇、组织了一批反党分子廖沫沙、吴晗等向党进攻。他利用他所掌握的报纸、刊物大量发射毒箭，直接攻击党中央，攻击毛泽东思想。在短短一年半时间内，他竟然写了一百五十篇“燕山黑话”，平均每隔三四天就放一次毒，来毒害劳动人民和青年。他诬蔑我们党是“瞎子”，他是“过路人”，要我们党听他的劝告。如果我们真要听他的劝告的话，那末中国就要改变颜色。邓拓是地地道道的修正主义者。在他的一百五十篇“燕山黑话”里，篇篇引用的是发了霉的故事。我们现在揭开那些外衣，他的脚爪就露了出来。不管你们是什么人，只要你们是反对党中央，反对毛泽东思想，你们就是我们的阶级敌人，我们就一定要坚决和你们斗争到底！
    上海求新造船厂检验工、五好工人沈银龙说：毛主席教导我们，凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。象邓拓这伙人的反党反社会主义勾当，如果不彻底揭露、彻底批判，那就后患无穷。正当前几年我们国家经济上遇到暂时困难的时候，邓拓这一伙趁机配合修正主义和其他反动势力，向党发起进攻，他在《燕山夜话》中说什么“趁火打劫”，“声东击西”，就是趁修正主义、反动分子之火，骂共产党，攻击社会主义，借古人的嘴来反党反社会主义，我们工人阶级绝对不容许。我们工人阶级、劳动人民要维护党，保卫社会主义建设，把社会主义革命进行到底，彻底打垮他们的黑店。
      挖掉毒草的老根
    上海市嘉定县徐行公社平民大队党支部书记宣振东说：今天早晨连着听了两次揭发邓拓反党反社会主义黑话的广播，真是越听越有气。党中央、毛主席处处为我们劳动人民着想，但邓拓恨得要死，一心要搞资本主义复辟，真是痴心梦想！邓拓是“自屋里，拆壁脚”，就是在我们内部挖墙脚。这顶顶恶毒，顶顶危险。他是老党员、老干部，想吓唬人。他指手划脚，划出了一个“反图”。如果我们照他的图样去造房子，那末造出来的一定是资本主义的，地主资本家享福，我们农民吃苦。邓拓诬蔑我们是“财迷”，只有“一个鸡蛋的家当”。这是什么话？我们国家“一穷二白”，底子薄，我们听毛主席的话，奋发图强、自力更生，正在建设社会主义。地主过去看不起我们贫下中农，骂我们“三钱染料就想开个大染坊”。邓拓的话，同地主的一模一样！我们一定要打倒邓拓这一伙反党反社会主义的坏人！
  上海市农业劳动模范、嘉定县徐行公社社员季德章说：邓拓说的是反党反社会主义的黑话，是见不得太阳光的。拿我们农村的事实来说，解放后有三笔账是忘不掉的：第一笔账是政治翻身账，从奴隶变成主人，我自己就是从长工成为市人民代表。第二笔账是生产发展账，正象“芝麻开花节节高”。解放前我们杨家村亩产三四百斤，如今一亩收到一千多斤。第三笔账是生活改善账，过去，我们杨家村三十六户人家，有三十二户吃了早顿没晚顿。现在，全公社平均每人收入一百五十六元。这是怎样来的？社员说：千条万条，共产党领导是第一条。邓拓，你诬蔑党中央是“瞎子”，我们看你才是地地道道的“瞎子”。你站在反动立场上，对摆在眼门前的事实，也看不见。“三家村”就是“三害村”。邓拓是“三害村”的“村长”，是毒草的根。我们农民挖毒草，从来都是挖根，现在也要挖掉这个老根！
      同不拿枪的敌人斗到底
      “南京路上好八连”副班长王福泉说：毛主席说，在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在。邓拓就是这种不拿枪的敌人。我们中国人民解放军是保卫社会主义的，不管他是什么人，只要他反党反人民，我们一定要以毛泽东思想为武器，坚决和他拚到底。邓拓写的文章，怪腔怪调，弯弯曲曲，表面上一下子好象看不出他讲的是什么意思，但用毛主席思想一照，他的狐狸尾巴就藏不住了。我是一个贫下中农子弟，过去我们受尽了剥削阶级的剥削和压迫。邓拓妄想让资本主义复辟，让剥削阶级重新上台，办不到！
    “南京路上好八连”班长沈贵金说：邓拓是资产阶级的代言人，是帝国主义的帮凶。一九六二年正是帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派反华大合唱唱得最响的时候，邓拓也很“辛苦”，写了很多文章攻击我们的党，和国内外牛鬼蛇神一唱一和，互相配合。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是被压迫人民解放的旗帜，而邓拓却诬蔑党，诬蔑毛泽东思想，这是他们反动阶级本能的表现。全国人民拥护党的建设社会主义总路线。正因为有了总路线，我们国家仅仅用了三年时间，就克服了自然灾害带来的严重困难，经济全面好转。这一切都说明党领导的正确。邓拓睁眼不看事实，同赫鲁晓夫唱同一个调子。现在，邓拓原形毕露了。这是一场严重的阶级斗争。这些事实教育我们青年人不要忘记阶级斗争，我们要坚决听毛主席的话，我们要向邓拓一伙开炮，狠狠地揭露他，让他在工农兵的怒吼声中发抖吧！
    滕昌玉（新战士）说：邓拓是反党反社会主义的罪人，我们要讨伐他，斗倒他。一九六二年，正是蒋介石企图反攻大陆的时候，他也趁机借古非今，反党反社会主义，实质上就是和蒋介石走一条路。他是给蒋介石搭桥，帮蒋介石的忙。这样的人是我们革命道路上的“拦路虎”，我们一定要把拦路虎打倒。
