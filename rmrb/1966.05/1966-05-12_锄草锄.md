    Collected Weeds

    Deng Tuo clamored to use "dog's blood shower" and "a specially made stick" to "specialize in treating" so-called revolutionaries suffering from "amnesia." Deng Tuo's "prescription" was not copied from the *Ling Shu Jing* or the *Huangdi Neijing*, but from "Sino-American Cooperative Organization" and "Central Intelligence Agency." In Zhazidong and the Shangrao concentration camp, the Kuomintang secret agents treated our revolutionary heroes with vicious methods such as pouring cold water and beating them into shock.
              Li Chongqian, Physician, Guangzhou First People's Hospital
    Deng Tuo said we have "amnesia," but in fact, we are not forgetful, we have a good memory. We clearly remember that in 1957, when the rightists attacked the Party, they wanted the "Communist Party to step down." Now Deng Tuo wants our Party to "rest." Isn't this exactly the same as the fallacies of the rightists? Therefore, it is Deng Tuo who is very forgetful; he has forgotten the fate of those rightists.
                        Luo Zhongchun, PLA Unit

    We say it is right, but Deng Tuo says it is wrong; we say it is good, but Deng Tuo says it is bad; what we like to support, Deng Tuo opposes and curses. This is what is called "what kind of vine produces what kind of melon," and "what class speaks what words." Because he is standing on the position of the bourgeoisie, breathing through the same nostril as imperialism and revisionism.
        Fan Guangrong, Model in Studying Chairman Mao's Works, Sichuan Commercial Front

    Deng Tuo pretends to be "benevolent," crying "bitter" for us working people, saying things like "After collecting hundreds of flowers to make honey, who knows for whom the sweetness is made," and "How many heartbroken people are there in the world, why begrudge donating a drop of sweetness," and so on. This is an insult to the great working class, treating us as slaves who only live for themselves and have no political ideals. Let me tell you, under the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, we fully understand that labor is for the revolution, for building socialism, and for the liberation of the oppressed people of the world. We are willing to endure great hardship and bear great labor. In this situation, the more bitter it is, the sweeter it feels in our hearts.
                    Zhou Zuozhi, Worker, Chengdu某 Mechanical Factory

    Deng Tuo slanders that our Party is "unpopular." This is complete nonsense. The Party is most popular among the people, only unpopular among anti-Party elements like Deng Tuo. Chairman Mao has long told us: "It is a good thing to be opposed by the enemy, not a bad thing." The fact that we are unpopular among Deng Tuo and his ilk proves that we are doing the right thing. We want to tell Deng Tuo that we will not gain your hearts today, nor will we gain your hearts tomorrow, never, ever will we gain your hearts.
                Shen Fangjuan, Saleswoman, Shenyang Department Store

    Deng Tuo said that "many ancient great politicians already knew the importance of cherishing labor power," accusing our Party of "growing up in the 1960s" as if it were not as good as ancient great politicians. We want to ask: Is the proletarian regime and the socialist system, which are regimes and systems that cherish the working people, not as good as the landlords and capitalists who exploit and oppress the working people "cherishing" the working people?
                  Huang Shirong, Worker, Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory

    A few years ago, the reactionary serf owners in Tibet shouted that the democratic reforms were a "mess" and that the people's lives were "worse than before." Deng Tuo and Wu Han also said that we had "destroyed all of the belongings of an egg" and that the people's communes had "made the people poor." The reactionary serf owners praised the traitorous head Dalai, who recognized thieves as his father, and Deng Tuo and Wu Han vigorously promoted the loyal lackeys of the ruling class—the so-called "honest officials." Their purpose is the same: to use the method of reversing black and white to achieve the goal of restoring the old system.
                  Zun Zhu, Doorman, Lhasa Department Store

专栏：

    锄草集
    邓拓叫嚷要用“狗血淋头”、“一根特制的棍棒”来“专治”所谓犯了“健忘症”的革命者。邓拓这味“药方子”不是抄自《灵枢经》，也不是抄自《黄帝素问》，而是抄自“中美合作所”、“中央情报局”。在渣滓洞，在上饶集中营，美蒋特务分子对待我们的革命志士，就是用的冷水浇身、打成休克的恶毒手段。
              广州市第一人民医院医师　李崇谦
    邓拓说我们害了“健忘症”，其实我们并不健忘，我们的记性很好。我们清楚地记得一九五七年，右派分子向党进攻时就要“共产党下台”，现在邓拓又要我们党去“休息”。这不是同右派分子的谬论一模一样吗？因此，倒是邓拓很健忘，他忘了那些右派分子的下场。
                        解放军某部　罗忠纯
    我们说是对的，邓拓却说是错的；我们说是好的，邓拓却说是坏的；我们喜欢拥护的，邓拓却是反对咒骂的。这就叫什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。因为他是站在资产阶级立场上，是和帝国主义、修正主义一鼻孔出气的。
        四川商业战线学习毛主席著作标兵　樊光荣
    邓拓假装“仁慈”，为我们劳动人民叫“苦”，说什么“采得百花成蜜后，不知辛苦为谁甜”，说什么“世间多少伤心客，何惜捐输一滴甜”，等等。这是对伟大工人阶级的侮辱，把我们当做只为自己生活，没有政治理想的奴才。告诉你，我们在党和毛主席的教导下，完全懂得劳动是为革命，为了建设社会主义，为了全世界被压迫人民的解放，我们甘愿吃大苦，耐大劳，在这种情况下，越苦心里越甜。
                    成都某机械厂工人　周作志
    邓拓污蔑我们党“不得人心”。这完全是一派胡言。党在人民群众中是最得人心的，只是不得邓拓之流的反党分子的心。毛主席早就告诉我们：“被敌人反对是好事，不是坏事。”我们不得邓拓之流的心，正说明我们做对了。我们要告诉邓拓，我们不但今天不会得你们的心，明天也不会得你们的心，永远永远不会得你们的心。
                沈阳市百货公司营业员　沈纺娟
    邓拓说什么“许多古代的大政治家已经知道爱护劳动力的重要意义”，指责我们党“生长在二十世纪六十年代”好象还不如古代的大政治家似的，我们要问：无产阶级的政权和社会主义的制度，是爱护劳动人民的政权和制度，难道还不如剥削压迫劳动人民的地主和资本家“爱护”劳动人民吗？
                  沈阳重型机械厂工人　黄石荣
    几年前，西藏的反动农奴主大叫大嚷民主改革搞“糟”了，人民生活“今不如昔”。邓拓和吴晗也说，我们把“一个鸡蛋的家当”“全部毁掉了”；人民公社“弄得老百姓穷光光的”。反动农奴主吹捧的是认贼作父的叛国大头子达赖，邓拓、吴晗大肆宣扬的是统治阶级的忠实走狗——所谓“清官”。他们的目的是一个，就是用颠倒黑白的手法，达到复辟旧制度的目的。
