    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper *Akahata* published articles on the 7th and 8th, exposing how US imperialism is using the Japanese Sato government to support the Indonesian right-wing military regime, in order to realize its plot to completely drag Indonesia into the Asian anti-communist bloc.

    The articles stated that since the September 30th Movement, the Indonesian right-wing has been requesting "aid" from the United States, Japan, and other Western countries. All these countries welcomed the right-wing regime from the beginning and provided it with assistance. As the Indonesian right-wing openly pursues pro-imperialist policies, these countries are further backing it up in order to stabilize it.

    The articles pointed out that the United States, in particular, has been the most enthusiastic in supporting this regime, which it established using its Central Intelligence Agency.

    The articles stated that one of the most important goals of the United States' Asian policy is to completely pull Indonesia into its bloc, making Indonesia a new member of the anti-communist group. In this regard, the United States will make its "most handy agent" – Japan – play a decisive role.

    The articles stated that the Sato government is most faithfully responding to this request from the United States, actively working for the United States. At the same time, the Sato government is taking the opportunity to allow Japanese monopoly capital to re-invade Southeast Asia.

    The articles stated that the Sato government has long expressed its support for the Indonesian right-wing regime. When the new (right-wing military) government was established, the Sato government decided to provide it with $2.5 million in emergency aid. Subsequently, the Sato government announced plans to convene a meeting of Indonesia's creditor nations – the United States, Japan, and Western European countries – and established the "Tokyo Club" composed of these creditor nations.

    The articles stated that when the Indonesian delegation, led by Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister Buwono, arrives in Tokyo soon, the Sato government will hold talks with it. The content of the talks will include providing funds for Indonesia to repay its foreign debt, providing loans to Indonesia, preparing for the establishment of the "Tokyo Club", and cooperating with Indonesia to develop natural resources.

    The articles stated that at the same time, the Sato government will also tell the delegation led by Buwono that Japan is willing to mediate between "Malaysia" and Indonesia. The articles pointed out that the Sato government has had frequent contact with the US government on this issue.

    Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, 7th: The Pakistani *Program* Weekly published an article in April stating: "The situation in Indonesia itself shows that there is some hidden hand manipulating behind the scenes, and that is US imperialism."

    The article pointed out: "Imperialism wants Indonesia to stop its confrontation with the British imperialist's running dog 'Malaysia', create tensions between Indonesia and China, and eliminate the Indonesian Communist Party and nationalists." The article said that the Indonesian communists and nationalists who were massacred were people who had played a major role in Indonesia's struggle for independence.

    The article also condemned Indonesian right-wing general Nasution as an "imperialist running dog".

    Rawalpindi's *Construction News* published an article on May 5th commenting on Britain's recent provision of £1 million in so-called "aid" to the Indonesian military regime, pointing out that this gesture is a bribe for Indonesia to stop its confrontation with "Malaysia" and also a reward for the massacre of Indonesian patriots.

    新华社八日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报《赤旗报》七日和八日连续发表文章，揭露美帝国主义正通过日本佐藤政府扶植印度尼西亚右派军人政权，以实现它的把印度尼西亚完全拉入亚洲反共集团的阴谋计划。
    文章说，自从九月三十日事件以来，印度尼西亚右派一直要求美国、日本和其它西方国家的“援助”。所有这些国家从一开始就对右派政权表示欢迎，并且向它提供了援助。随着印度尼西亚右派公开奉行亲帝国主义的政策，这些国家正在进一步给它撑腰，以便使它稳定下来。
    文章指出：特别是美国，它利用它的中央情报局建立了这个右派政权，一直是最热心于扶植这个政权的。
    文章说，美国的亚洲政策的最重要的目的之一，是把印度尼西亚完全拉进它的集团，使印度尼西亚成为反共集团中的新的一员。在这一方面，美国将使它的“最得心应手的代理人”——日本起决定性的作用。
    文章说，佐藤政府在最忠实地响应美国的这个要求，积极为美国奔走，同时佐藤政府也趁机使日本垄断资本重新对东南亚进行侵略。
    文章说，佐藤政府早就表示了支持印度尼西亚右派政权的态度。在新的（右派军人）政府成立的时候，佐藤政府就决定向它提供二百五十万美元的紧急援助。随后，佐藤政府宣布了召开印度尼西亚债权国美国、日本和西欧国家的会议的计划，并成立由这些债权国组成的“东京俱乐部”。
    文章说，在由印度尼西亚副总理布沃诺率领的印度尼西亚代表团不久后来到东京的时候，佐藤政府将同它会谈，会谈的内容将包括为印度尼西亚偿还外债提供资金、向印度尼西亚贷款以及筹备建立“东京俱乐部”，同印度尼西亚合作开发自然资源等问题。
    文章说，同时，佐藤政府还将告诉布沃诺率领的代表团，日本愿意在“马来西亚”和印度尼西亚之间进行调停。文章指出，佐藤政府已就这一问题同美国政府进行了频繁的接触。
    新华社拉瓦尔品第七日电巴基斯坦《纲领》周刊在四月份发表一篇文章说：“印度尼西亚的局势本身就说明了幕后有某种隐蔽的手在操纵，那就是美帝国主义。”
    文章指出：“帝国主义要印度尼西亚停止对英帝国主义的走卒‘马来西亚’的对抗，制造印度尼西亚同中国的紧张局势，搞掉印度尼西亚共产党和民族主义者。”文章说，印度尼西亚被屠杀的共产党人和民族主义者都是在印度尼西亚争取独立的斗争中起过重大作用的人。
    文章还谴责印度尼西亚右派将领纳苏蒂安是“帝国主义的走狗”。
    拉瓦尔品第的《建设报》五月五日发表文章评论英国最近向印度尼西亚军事政权提供一百万英镑的所谓“援助”时指出，这个姿态是贿赂印度尼西亚停止对“马来西亚”的对抗，也是对屠杀印度尼西亚爱国者的报酬。
