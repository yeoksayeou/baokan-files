    What are the sinister intentions of the "Beijing Daily"?
    Fifth-grade student, Department of Law, Peking University, Wei Bing
    We sent many articles criticizing the "Three-Family Village" for their crimes against the Party and socialism to the "Beijing Daily". However, they have been withholding them for a long time. Even in the one article they did publish, they cut out important viewpoints and content. What are their sinister intentions?
    After reading Comrade Gao Ju's "Firing at the Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Black Line" published in the "People's Liberation Army Daily" and Comrade He Ming's "Open Your Eyes and Distinguish Truth from Falsehood" published in the "Guangming Daily," we were greatly enlightened. We then re-studied Chairman Mao's relevant works with this question in mind, and deepened our understanding of the crimes of Deng Tuo, Liao Mosha, and Wu Han and their gang against the Party and socialism. At the same time, we felt extremely indignant at the "Beijing Daily's" shameful methods of exonerating Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party elements in this sharp class struggle.
    When we exposed the crimes of the "Three-Family Village" against the Party and socialism, we sent twenty-nine articles to the "Beijing Daily," some of which were written together with poor and lower-middle peasants. However, the "Beijing Daily" withheld some critical articles for a long time. It was not until the "People's Liberation Army Daily" and the "Guangming Daily" exposed their conspiracy that they published our article, "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Sternly Criticize Wu Han's Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Words and Deeds," which we sent on April 26. However, the "Beijing Daily" shamelessly adopted methods such as decapitation, tail removal, and heart removal, cutting out the important viewpoints and content of the poor and lower-middle peasants' exposure of Wu Han, making the article unrecognizable, weak, and powerless.
    At the beginning of the article, we quoted Chairman Mao's instructions in "Speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work of the Communist Party of China": "All erroneous ideas, all poisonous weeds, all monsters and demons, should be criticized and should never be allowed to spread freely." The article then pointed out that "Wu Han, in the two big poisonous weeds, 'Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor' and 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,' adopted the method of using the past to satirize the present, launching a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism, arousing the boundless indignation of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers." However, the "Beijing Daily" deleted this passage of Chairman Mao's and our analysis. We believe that this is not just a matter of a few words, but the most fundamental principle of whether or not to carry out this socialist cultural revolution according to Chairman Mao's teachings. We want to ask the "Beijing Daily," where are you trying to lead this struggle?
    The title of the first major paragraph of the article was: "'Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor' and 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' are scolding the Party and socialism, paving the way for right-leaning opportunists." The "Beijing Daily" removed "paving the way for right-leaning opportunists" from the title. We want to ask the "Beijing Daily," what exactly are your sinister intentions?
    In the article, the poor and lower-middle peasant Ma Deshan sternly warned Wu Han, saying: "Chairman Mao is our great savior. He leads the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Anyone who dares to scold Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we will definitely overthrow him." The "Beijing Daily" also removed it with ulterior motives. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants spoke their heartfelt infinite love for the Party and Chairman Mao, but you find it unpleasant to hear. Isn't it very clear where you stand?
    In the second major paragraph of the article, the poor and lower-middle peasants pointed out: "Wu Han and Khrushchev are on the same stand." This was a sharp and incisive stab at Wu Han's vitals. However, the "Beijing Daily" also adopted a heart-removing tactic and removed it. This clearly shows that you and Wu Han are in the same boat, fearing that your sinful deeds will be exposed to the light of day.
    We have only excerpted the above few intolerable points, but it is enough to show how despicable the methods of the "Beijing Daily" are! We want to solemnly tell you that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, we will certainly be able to drag out all the monsters and demons. If you continue to be obsessed, the people will not agree.

### 《北京日报》安的什么心？

    《北京日报》安的什么心？
    北京大学法律系五年级　卫兵
    我们把好多批判“三家村”反党反社会主义罪行的文章，寄给《北京日报》。可是，它们长期扣压下来。发表的一篇，也把重要观点和内容砍掉。这是安的什么心？
    读了《解放军报》刊登的高炬同志《向反党反社会主义的黑线开火》和《光明日报》发表的何明同志《擦亮眼睛，辨别真假》的文章后，受到很大的启发。我们又带着这个问题，重新学习了毛主席有关著作，对邓拓、廖沫沙、吴晗一伙反党反社会主义的罪行，提高了认识；同时对《北京日报》在这场尖锐的阶级斗争中，为邓拓等一伙反党分子开脱罪责的可耻手法，感到无比愤慨。
    我们曾在揭露“三家村”的反党反社会主义的罪行时，先后给《北京日报》寄去二十九篇文章，其中有几篇是与贫下中农一起写的。但是，《北京日报》把有些批判文章长期扣压下来。直到《解放军报》和《光明日报》揭露其阴谋时，他们才发表了我们在四月二十六日寄去的《贫下中农严厉批驳吴晗的反党反社会主义的言行》一文。但是，《北京日报》却无耻地采取了斩头、去尾、挖心等手法，将文章中贫下中农揭露吴晗的重要观点及内容砍去，使文章变得面目全非，软弱无力。
    文章开头，我们引用毛主席在《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》中指出的：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”文章接着指出，“吴晗在《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》两株大毒草中，采用借古讽今的手法，向党向社会主义发动猖狂的进攻，激起了广大工农兵群众的无比愤慨”。但是《北京日报》将毛主席的这一段话和我们的分析删除了。我们认为，这决不是几句话的问题，而是要不要按着毛主席的这一教导，来进行这场社会主义文化大革命的最根本的原则问题。我们要问《北京日报》，你们将要把这场斗争引向哪里去？
    文章第一大段的标题是：“《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》就是骂党、骂社会主义，为右倾机会主义分子鸣锣开道”。《北京日报》将标题中的“为右倾机会主义分子鸣锣开道”去掉了。我们要问《北京日报》，你们究竟安的是什么心？
    在文章中，贫下中农马德山曾严厉正告吴晗说：“毛主席是我们的大救星，他领导中国革命和世界革命，谁要敢骂毛主席和共产党，我们就一定把他斗倒。”《北京日报》也别有用心地把它去掉了。广大贫下中农说出了自己心中对党和毛主席的无限敬爱的话，但是你们却听着不顺耳，你们究竟站在什么立场，不是很清楚吗？
    在文章第二大段，贫下中农指出：“吴晗同赫鲁晓夫是一个立场”。这是一针见血地刺痛了吴晗的要害。但是，《北京日报》也采取了挖心战术，将它挖掉了。这清楚不过地说明了，你们和吴晗是同命相怜的，惧怕你们的罪恶勾当暴露于光天化日之下。
    我们仅摘录了以上这些令人不能容忍的几点，但是已足说明《北京日报》的手法是多么卑劣！我们要正告你们，我们在毛泽东思想的指引下，与广大工农兵群众一道，一定能够把一切牛鬼蛇神全都揪出来。你们再执迷不悟，人民是不能答应的。
