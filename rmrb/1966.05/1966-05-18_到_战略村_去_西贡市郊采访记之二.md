    Going to the "Strategic Hamlet"
    Second Report on Interviews in the Suburbs of Saigon
            "Entering in Broad Daylight"
    One day, comrades from the Front Command of the Liberation Armed Forces in the Saigon-Gia Dinh area excitedly told us: "You can go and see the 'strategic hamlet'."
    "Enter in broad daylight?"
    "In broad daylight, and there are puppet troop outposts there."
    We were truly excited and thrilled to hear this. Who would have thought that so close to Saigon, in broad daylight, with American planes circling overhead, we could penetrate the enemy-occupied zone and break into a "strategic hamlet." Doesn't this precisely demonstrate the power of the revolutionary people?

    Enemy planes dived overhead, and bombs fell on villages not far away. We left the liberated area and moved quickly through the dense rubber forest. Sometimes we bypassed villages, walking in open areas; sometimes we dodged enemy planes, prostrating ourselves on the waterlogged ridges. After walking a long way, a small lake appeared in front of us. We boarded a narrow wooden boat, crossed the lake, and reached the sandy beach on the other side. A young man warmly pulled us ashore, unable to help but smile and say: "Comrades, you have already entered the 'strategic hamlet'."

    It seemed that this hidden shallow beach was deliberately chosen for "landing." We looked forward along the beach, and bamboo fences, barbed wire, and trenches were vaguely visible. The puppet troops in the village probably wouldn't even imagine that we had broken into the "strategic hamlet" "security system" under their gun muzzles.
    "The village is calm, the outpost is surrounded by us." The young man who greeted us gave us a firm look. Hearing that the enemy in the "strategic hamlet" was surrounded sounded a bit incredible.

    We walked very slowly along a green, shady oxcart path along the edge of the village, wanting to see as much as possible. We crossed a weedy path, stepped over a low fence, and in front of us were rows of small houses. The guide led us along the base of the walls, whispering: "We are at the center of the village." Here, the small houses were one after another, symmetrical, some with wooden pillars and tile roofs, some with bamboo walls and grass roofs. The houses were small, close to the roadside, and the doors all faced the road. This was for the convenience of the puppet police to supervise and inspect. Most of the houses were empty, and some had calendars and comic strips produced in Saigon hanging on the walls. But not a single house hung the puppet national flag, or portraits of American imperialist aggressors and their running dogs. Many families, men, women, and old people, were sitting inside the houses weaving baskets.

    We didn't speak along the way, only observing with our eyes. There were many passersby, men and women all wearing black clothes and black pants, or white clothes and white pants. They stared at us. From the expressions of the people, we saw not surprise, but a composure, firmness, and warmth from the bottom of their hearts. An old man glanced westward, smiled, and shook his hand at us, signaling that there were no puppet troops here. Some old women brought us cold well water, using coconut shell spoons, scooping a full spoonful, wanting us to drink our fill. The children, in twos and threes, were already clinging to us, holding the hands of the Liberation Army soldiers, and touching the shiny submachine guns.

    We were led to the edge of a dense bamboo grove. The young man came over and smiled: "Here, you can use your mouths." The villagers were very enthusiastic, holding our hands tightly, shaking them again and again, not letting go for a long time. Their eyes sparkled with friendly light.
      "Don't worry, the enemy doesn't dare to come out." A sturdy middle-aged man raised his fist and said: "We are in the enemy's heart, the enemy is in our palm."
    We asked: How does the enemy control the "strategic hamlet"?
      "Barbed wire can bind people, but it can't bind our hearts." A villager said with a smile: "Now it can't even bind people, haven't you come in?" This remark made everyone laugh.

    This "strategic hamlet" is about ten kilometers from Saigon. More than three thousand people are imprisoned in the entire village. When the village was first built, the "strategic hamlet" was full of fortifications and strictly managed. The first fortification outside the village was barbed wire covered with spikes, the second was a high fence, and the third was a meter and a half high earthen wall. Between each fortification, there were traps and trenches up to two meters deep. Around the village, there were bunkers and hidden bunkers, and a row of puppet troops stationed in the village to suppress the masses. At the door of each household, there was a household registration book with photos, for the puppet police to check at any time. The time for leaving and returning to the village was stipulated, and it was not allowed to bring food to the fields, for fear that the masses would send rice to the guerrillas. Gatherings of three people, leaving the village, and visitors had to report to the puppet village chief. Those who violated the village rules were lightly punished with hard labor, fined 500 to 1,000 puppet currency, and severely imprisoned.

    A young man said: "We armed ourselves to fight, organized secret guerrilla teams, and today, that set of oppressive things no longer works." He said it slowly and calmly, but it summarized much hardship and tenacious struggle. We thought, only those who have experienced life-and-death struggle can say it so correctly and powerfully, so well.
        "How Today's Situation Was Created"
      "Let me tell you a struggle story first!" The young man seemed to have guessed our thoughts, interjected: "After you hear the story of a teenager in our village's struggle, you will understand how today's situation was created, and what spirit we are fighting with."
    "Is this teenager still in the village?" we asked.
    "He has already gloriously sacrificed. He is a hero, just as the people in our village sing: He is our example, illuminating our path forward."

    This teenager was called A Shen, and he was only fifteen years old when he sacrificed. He was not tall, with dark skin, and quite sturdy. He came from a poor peasant family and herded cattle from a young age. Under the education of revolutionary cadres, he gradually understood the principles of struggle. After the American and puppet troops imprisoned his entire family in this "strategic hamlet," he participated in the struggle to destroy the "strategic hamlet" together with the adults. He organized the cattle herders, taking advantage of opportunities to remove fence spikes and damage fortifications. Sometimes, under the cover of darkness, he touched the vicinity of bunkers to post slogans such as "Down with American Imperialism."

    Once, A Shen gathered the cattle herders and said softly: "Brothers and sisters fight the enemy with weapons, we don't have weapons, how can we do it?" The cattle herders all agreed with A Shen's opinion: fight the puppet troops, seize weapons. They hid in the bushes, looking for opportunities. One day, two puppet troops came out for a stroll and walked into their ambush circle. A Shen and the cattle herders quickly raised their wooden sticks and hit the heads of the puppet troops. The little guys used all their strength, and with one stick, the puppet troops fell to the ground without even having time to turn their heads. This attack, the cattle herding team seized four grenades, and A Shen got one. From then on, he was even more courageous. Later, A Shen, with the help of adults, disassembled old bicycle steel pipes and made a single-shot homemade gun. He entered and exited the enemy's training ground, "stealing" bullets, he sneaked out of the "strategic hamlet," delivering letters, guiding the way.... He excellently completed his tasks, enabling the "strategic hamlet" to maintain close contact with the revolutionary forces.

    In order to strictly control this "strategic hamlet," the enemy sent the ruthless killer Lao Zhen. As soon as the thug entered the village, he arrested people, killed people, raped women, and did all kinds of evil. The masses hated him to the bone. If he was not punished, the struggle in the village would be difficult to carry out. The patriots in the "strategic hamlet" were considering how to eliminate this evil dog. "Leave it to me!" After A Shen knew about it, he found the leader himself and requested the task. The leader saw that A Shen was brave and resourceful, so he agreed and sent another person to go with him. After reconnaissance, A Shen understood the thug's routine. One day, A Shen and his comrade secretly carried homemade guns and grenades, came to a small food shop in the village, stood outside leaning against the corner of the wall, their round eyes staring at one end of the road. After a while, they saw the thug swaggering over and turning into the small shop. A Shen and his comrade then followed into the shop. As soon as the thug sat down, A Shen jumped in front of him. "What are you doing here?" The thug glanced at A Shen fiercely. A Shen did not show any weakness, his bright eyes flashing with two strong bursts of anger, shouting: "I want to eat you." Then he pulled out his gun, pointed it at the thug, and quickly pulled the trigger. The thug shivered for a while, screaming: "There's a 'little Viet Cong'..." Before he could finish his words, he fell to the ground and didn't move.

    After A Shen eliminated the thug, the puppet troops in the village did not dare to move rashly anymore. The fighting enthusiasm of the people in the "strategic hamlet" was even higher.

    Later, A Shen was unfortunately discovered by the enemy while performing a task. The enemy's machine guns fired wildly at A Shen, and tracer bullets swooshed over. A Shen cleverly lay down, shouting to the back: "I'll cover, you retreat." Just after shouting, a bullet pierced his calf. The enemy rushed over, and dense bullets separated A Shen from the contact with other comrades. A Shen pulled out his gun and fired a shot at the enemy. He was using a single-shot homemade gun, and at this time, there was no wooden stopper beside him, and the cartridge could not be ejected. The enemy rushed up again, shouting while firing: "Surrender, surrender!" A Shen propped himself up, pulled out his short knife, and threw it hard at the enemy's head. The enemy retreated a few steps and rushed up again, howling like a wolf: "Surrender, surrender!" A Shen clenched the handle of the homemade gun and stood up from the ground: "Go to hell!" The homemade gun swooshed and flew towards the enemy's head. In the chaos, the enemy fired wildly at A Shen. A Shen heroically sacrificed on the battlefield in the "strategic hamlet."

    Is it necessary to ask about the heroic deeds of others? No need to ask anymore. Aren't the people in the "strategic hamlet" all fighting! As a young man said: "The American and puppet troops use 'strategic hamlets' to surround us, but we have turned the 'strategic hamlets' into battlefields for annihilating the enemy."
        "Revolutionary Will Cannot Be Imprisoned"
    While we were talking, someone came to tell us that we could go and see the puppet troop outpost. The puppet troop outpost in the "strategic hamlet" was located on the side of the road at the west end of the village. We walked from the east end of the village to the west end. Sometimes we walked close to the wall, sometimes we drilled into the bushes. After walking a long distance, we approached the enemy's outpost. We observed from the bushes, and later climbed to the roof to see. The puppet troop's guard tower was only thirty to fifty meters away, clearly visible. The outpost was a large yard surrounded by walls. In the center of the yard, the puppet national flag, like a rag, drooped on a low flagpole. The puppet troop on guard duty showed his steel helmet and turtle shell. Apparently, he didn't notice anything. Look at him, with his hands in his pockets, holding his gun, stiff as a log, seemingly still at ease!

    We observed near the outpost for a long time. At this time, two women walked towards us. The Vietnamese comrade who came with us asked: "Walking under the enemy's guns, aren't you afraid?" "What's there to be afraid of!" A woman smiled and looked at the puppet troops on the guard tower, and then said: "Didn't you see? They don't dare to come out, they don't even dare to lift their heads." We were infected by her hearty laughter.

    In the evening, we withdrew from the "strategic hamlet" and returned to the liberated area. We walked on the main road in the center of the village, and with every step, we couldn't suppress the excitement in our hearts. Here, we saw the creative struggle and glorious victory of the people of South Vietnam on another front.

    Five years ago, with the arrival of a large number of American "advisors" on the land of South Vietnam, "strategic hamlets" appeared. How many dreams did the American aggressors have! They thought that once this carefully planned "masterpiece" of "strategic hamlets" was realized, it would not only imprison the people, but also isolate the broad masses of the people from the revolutionary forces, so that the revolutionary forces would not be able to survive, and the American aggressors could "drain the pond to catch all the fish." At that time, the American and puppet group clamored arrogantly: "Within eight months, 16,000 'strategic hamlets' will be built throughout South Vietnam." However, the American imperialists' "strategic hamlet" plan had just opened and quickly declared bankruptcy.

    American imperialism always lifts a stone to drop it on its own feet. The various persecutions they have committed against the revolutionary people, in the final analysis, can only promote the people to more widely and intensely engage in revolutionary struggle. The people of South Vietnam relied on themselves, united, organized, launched armed uprisings in entire townships and counties, seized weapons, smashed the grassroots puppet regime, and destroyed "strategic hamlets." In the past few years, the eight thousand "strategic hamlets" that the American and puppet group had spent a great deal of effort to build collapsed like a mountain. At present, only a small part of "strategic hamlets" remain around large cities and along some main roads. Those left around Saigon are considered to be more numerous. And even these "strategic hamlets" are mostly in the hands of the people.

    As we walked, we thought, what is the overall impression of this interview? After thinking about it, we felt that what the people in the "strategic hamlet" said to us was the most concise and best: "Today, you have seen in the 'strategic hamlet' who surrounded whom, who defeated whom, and who is the real strongman. American imperialism racked its brains to come up with 'strategic hamlets' to imprison people, but it forgot that the revolutionary will and revolutionary beliefs of the people cannot be imprisoned. The enemy uses 'strategic hamlets' to imprison us, we arm ourselves, and turn 'strategic hamlets' into battlefields for annihilating the enemy. Victory will definitely belong to us, the people of the South."

### 到“战略村”去   西贡市郊采访记之二

    到“战略村”去
    西贡市郊采访记之二
            “大白天进去”
    一天，西贡—嘉定地区解放武装力量前线指挥部的同志兴冲冲地告诉我们：“你们可以到‘战略村’里去看看。”
    “大白天进去？”
    “大白天，而且那里还有伪军哨所。”
    我们听了真是兴奋而激动。谁想得到，紧临西贡，大白天，头顶上来回盘旋着美国飞机，而我们竟能深入敌占区，闯进“战略村”。这件事难道不正说明了革命人民的力量强大吗？
    敌机在头顶上俯冲，炸弹落在不远的村庄里。我们离开了解放区，急速地穿行在橡胶园的密林中。有时我们绕过村庄，走在开阔地里；有时躲敌机，又伏倒在积水的田埂上。走了好长一段路程，前面出现了一个不大的湖泊。我们登上狭长的小木舟，越过湖泊，到了对岸沙滩上，一个小伙子亲热地拉着我们上了岸，禁不住喜笑着说：“同志，你们已经进到‘战略村’里了。”
    看来，是有意选择这个隐蔽的浅滩“登陆”的。我们顺着沙滩向前望去，竹篱笆、铁丝网和堑壕隐隐可见。村里的伪军恐怕连想都不会想到，我们竟闯进了他们炮口下的“战略村”“安全体系”。
    “村里平静，哨所被我们包围了。”迎接我们的小伙子向我们投来坚定的目光。乍一听“战略村”里敌人被包围，多少还有点不可思议。
    我们沿着村边的一条绿荫遮天的牛车道走得很慢，想尽量多看看。越过了杂草丛生的小路，跨过了一道低矮的篱笆，眼前是一排排小平屋。领路的人带我们贴着墙根走，小声地说：“到村中心了。”这里，小平房一个接一个，都是对称的，有的是木柱瓦顶，有的是竹墙草顶，屋不大，紧挨在大路两旁，门口都朝大路开。这是便于伪军警监督检查。多数的房屋里空荡荡，有的屋里墙壁上挂着西贡出品的日历和连环画象。但没有一个屋里挂伪国旗，或者挂美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗象的。好些人家，男女老乡正坐在屋内编箩筐。
    沿途我们没有说话，只用两只眼睛观察。来往的行人很多，男男女女都穿着黑衣黑裤，或白衣白裤。他们定睛望着我们。我们从人们的神情中，看到的不是惊奇，而是一种沉着、坚定和出自内心的热情。有个老头双目向西边一瞅，笑着向我们摇摇手，示意说：这儿没有伪军。有的老大妈给我们端来了冰冷的井水，用椰子壳做成的勺子，满满舀了一勺，要我们喝个饱。那三三两两的儿童，早缠着我们了，他们握住解放军的手，摸摸发亮的冲锋枪。
    我们被领到了浓密的竹丛边上。小伙子凑过来笑了笑：“这里，你们可以用嘴了。”老乡们十分热情，紧紧拉住我们的手，又是握，又是摇，久久不放。眼睛里闪烁着亲切的光芒。
      “不用担心，敌人不敢出来。”一个结实的中年人举起拳头说：“我们在敌人的心脏里，敌人在我们的手掌里。”
    我们问：敌人如何控制“战略村”？
      “铁丝网捆得住人，却捆不住我们的心。”一位老乡笑着说：“现在连人也捆不住了，你们不是也进来了吗？”这一说，引得所有人都笑了起来。
    这个“战略村”离西贡约莫十多公里。全村囚禁了三千多人。刚建村时，“战略村”工事林立，管理森严。外村头一道工事是布满尖刺的铁丝网，第二道是高高的篱笆，第三道是一米半高的土墙。每道工事之间，布有陷阱和深达二米的堑壕。村的四周设有碉堡和暗堡，一排伪军驻在村内，镇压群众。挨家挨户大门口，都挂着贴有相片的户口册，待伪军警随时检查。出村回村都规定了时刻，下地劳动时不准带饭，害怕群众把米饭送给游击队。三人聚会、出村和来人，都要报告伪村长。违犯村规者，轻则罚苦役，罚钱五百至一千伪币，重则关进监牢。
    一个小伙子说：“我们武装起来斗争，组织了秘密游击队，今天，那套压人的东西也就不再起作用了。”他说得缓慢而平淡，但它概括了多少艰难困苦和顽强斗争。我们想，只有经历过生死斗争的人，才能说得这样正确有力，这样好。
        “今天的局面是怎样创造的”
      “你们先听听一个斗争事例吧！”这位青年似乎猜透了我们的心思，插口说：“你们听了我村一位少年的斗争事迹，就会了解，今天的局面是怎样创造的，我们是以什么精神在战斗的。”
    “这位少年还在村里吗？”我们问。
    “他已经光荣牺牲了。他是个英雄，正象我们村里人歌唱的那样：他是我们的榜样，照亮了我们前进的道路。”
    这个少年叫阿申，牺牲那年才满十五岁。他身材不高，黑黑的皮肤，挺结实。贫农家出身，从小放牛。他在革命干部的教育下，渐渐懂得了斗争的道理。美伪军把他全家囚进这个“战略村”后，他和大人一起参加了破坏“战略村”的斗争。他把放牛娃组织起来，利用机会，拔除篱笆尖桩，踩坏工事。有时趁黑天摸到碉堡附近，贴“打倒美帝国主义”的标语。
    一次，阿申召集放牛娃小声说：“哥哥姐姐打敌人都有武器，我们没有武器，咋行？”放牛娃们都同意阿申意见：打伪军，夺武器。他们躲进树丛里，寻找机会。有一天，两个伪军出来溜街，走进了他们的伏击圈。阿申和放牛娃敏捷地举起木棍朝伪军头上打去。小家伙们使出了全身的劲，一木棍下去，伪军连头也来不及回，就应声倒地了。这一次袭击，牛娃队缴获了四颗手榴弹，阿申分得了一颗。从此，他更勇敢了。后来，阿申又在大人帮助下，拆开旧自行车钢管，做了一支单发的土手枪。他出入敌人操场，“偷”子弹，他潜出“战略村”，送信、领路……。他出色地完成了任务，使“战略村”与革命力量保持了紧密联系。
    敌人为严格控制这个“战略村”，派来了杀人不眨眼的恶棍老真。恶棍一进村，又抓人，又杀人，奸淫妇女，无恶不作。群众恨之入骨，不惩办，村里的斗争也难于展开。“战略村”的爱国者正在考虑，要铲除这条恶狗。“交给我吧！”阿申知道之后，自己找到了领导人要求任务。领导人见阿申英勇机智，就同意了，并派了另一个人和他一起去。阿申经过侦察，了解了恶棍的行动规律。一天，阿申和他的战友秘密地挎着土手枪和手榴弹，来到村里一家小食店，在外面贴着墙角一站，浑圆的两眼瞅着公路一端。不一会，只见恶棍大摇大摆地踱过来，拐进小店。阿申和他的战友随即跟了进店。恶棍刚坐稳，阿申纵身一跃到了他的面前。“你过来做什么？”恶棍恶狠狠地瞟了阿申一眼。阿申毫不示弱，明亮的眼睛里闪着两股逼人的怒气，喝叱道：“我要吃你。”随即拔出枪，顶着恶棍，迅速勾动扳机。恶棍一阵哆嗦，狂叫：“有‘小越共’……”话没说完，就倒在地上一动也不动了。
    阿申铲除恶棍之后，村里的伪军不敢再轻易乱动了。“战略村”人民的斗争热情更高涨了。
    后来，阿申在执行一项任务时，不幸被敌人发觉。敌人的机枪疯狂地向阿申射击，曳光弹嗖嗖地扑过来。阿申机灵地躺倒，一边向后面呼喊：“我掩护，你们撤。”刚喊罢，一颗子弹穿进了他的小腿肚。敌人冲过来，密集的枪弹隔开了阿申和其他同志的联系。阿申拔出枪，朝敌人打了一枪。他用的是单发土枪，这时，身旁又没有木塞，退不下弹壳。敌人又冲上来了，一边打枪，一边叫喊：“投降，投降！”阿申撑起身子，拔出短刀，用力向敌人头上扔过去。敌人后退几步，又冲上来，象恶狼似的嚎叫：“投降，投降！”阿申捏紧土枪柄，从地上站立起来：“去你的吧！”土手枪嗖的一声向敌人头上飞了过去。敌人在慌乱中朝阿申乱打枪。阿申英勇牺牲在“战略村”里的阵地上。
    还需要问其他人的英勇斗争事迹么？不用再问了。“战略村”里的人们不都在斗争吗！正如一个青年说的：“美伪军用‘战略村’包围我们，我们却把‘战略村’变成了歼敌的战场。”
        “革命意志是囚不住的”
    正谈着，有人来告诉说，可以去看伪军哨所了。“战略村”伪军哨所设在村西头公路边。我们从村东朝村西走。有时贴着墙走，有时钻进树丛走。走了一长段路，我们逼近了敌人哨所。我们从树丛中观察，后来又爬上屋顶看。伪军的哨所岗楼只有三五十米远，看得清清楚楚。哨所是用墙壁围起来的一个大院子。院中央，伪国旗象块破布，耷拉在低矮的旗杆上。站岗的伪军，露出了钢盔乌龟壳。看样子，什么也没有发觉。你看他，揣着手，抱着枪，呆若木鸡，似乎还心安理得呢！
    我们在哨所附近观察了很久。这时迎面走来了两个妇女。和我们一起来的越南同志问：“在敌人枪口下走，不怕吗？”“怕什么！”一位妇女笑呵呵地望了望岗楼上的伪军，接着说：“你们不是看见了吗？他们不敢出来，连头也不敢抬一抬。”我们被她的爽朗笑声感染了。
    傍晚时，我们撤离“战略村”，返回解放区。我们走在村中心大道上，每走一步，都抑制不住内心的兴奋。我们在这里看到了越南南方人民在另一条战线上的创造性的斗争和光辉的胜利。
    五年前，随着大批美国“顾问”踏上南越的土地，就出现了“战略村”。美国侵略者做了多少美梦！他们以为“战略村”这个精心策划的“杰作”一旦实现，既可以囚住人民，又能够把广大人民同革命力量隔绝，革命力量就无法生存，美国侵略者就可以“竭泽而渔”了。当时，美伪集团狂妄地叫嚷：“八个月内，南越全境要建成一万六千个‘战略村’”。可是，美帝国主义的“战略村”计划刚开张，很快就宣告破产了。
    美帝国主义总是搬起石头打自己的脚的，它们对革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促使人民更广泛更剧烈地投入革命斗争。越南南方人民依靠自己团结起来，组织起来，整乡整县地发动武装起义，夺取武器，打烂基层伪政权，捣毁“战略村”。几年来，美伪集团花了九牛二虎之力建立起来的八千个“战略村”，象山崩一样，塌下来了。目前，只是在大城市周围和一些主要公路两旁，还残剩着小部分“战略村”。西贡市四周留下的，还算是较多的。而就是这些“战略村”，很多也握在人民手掌里。
    我们一路走，一路想，这次采访的总的印象是什么呢？想来想去，觉得还是“战略村”里的人们对我们说的最概括、最好：“今天，你们在‘战略村’里看到了到底是谁包围了谁，谁战胜了谁，谁是真正的强者。美帝国主义挖空心思想出了囚人的‘战略村’，但是它就忘记了，人民的革命意志和革命信念是囚不住的。敌人用‘战略村’来囚我们，我们武装起来，变‘战略村’为歼敌的战场。胜利是一定属于我们南方人民的。”
