    Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Huang Muhe, a cadre of the Jakarta Chinese Overseas Chinese Associations, who remained unyielding under the brutal attacks of Indonesian right-wing soldiers and thugs, arrived in Beijing today by plane from Guangzhou.

    On the morning of April 8th, Indonesian right-wing thugs broke into the Jakarta Chinese Overseas Chinese Associations and unreasonably and forcibly occupied the association's premises. Huang Muhe was shamelessly kidnapped by right-wing thugs and severely injured after being subjected to six hours of brutal torture by right-wing soldiers and thugs for resolutely refusing to sign documents handing over the property of the Chinese Overseas Chinese Associations. During the thugs' torment, Huang Muhe fought bravely and unyieldingly, displaying the heroic spirit of the Chinese people. After serious representations from our embassy, Huang Muhe was released and left Indonesia on April 30th, returning to Guangzhou.

    Huang Changshui and Zhuang Mingli, deputy directors of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and Wang Yuanxing, vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and chairman of the Beijing Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, were among those who welcomed Huang Muhe today. Huang Muhe was helped off the plane by staff members of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. Huang Changshui, Zhuang Mingli, and others stepped forward, shook hands warmly with Huang Muhe, and expressed their heartfelt greetings.

    Female students from the Art Department of Huaqiao University presented flowers to Huang Muhe. With激动的心情 Huang Muhe thanked Huang Changshui, Zhuang Mingli, and others for the motherland's concern for him.

    Zhang Guoji, Zhu Yi, Chen Manyun, Zhang Chukun, and other responsible persons from relevant departments, as well as Chinese overseas Chinese personnel from the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta who had returned to Beijing earlier, were also at the airport to welcome him.

    新华社八日讯　在印度尼西亚右派军人和暴徒毒打下威武不屈的雅加达中华侨团总会干事黄沐和，今天从广州乘飞机到达北京。
    四月八日清晨，印度尼西亚右派暴徒闯入雅加达中华侨团总会，无理强行霸占会所。黄沐和因为坚决拒绝签署交出中华侨团总会房产的字据，被右派暴徒无耻绑架，并遭到右派军人和暴徒长达六小时的严刑拷打而受了重伤。在暴徒百般折磨他的时候，黄沐和英勇斗争，毫不屈服，表现出中国人民的英雄气节。后经我使馆严正交涉，黄沐和才获得释放，并在四月三十日离开了印度尼西亚回到广州。
    今天前往欢迎黄沐和的，有华侨事务委员会副主任黄长水、庄明理，全国侨联副主席、北京市侨联主席王源兴等。黄沐和在华侨事务委员会工作人员扶持着走下飞机，黄长水、庄明理等迎上前去，同黄沐和紧紧握手，向他表示亲切慰问。
    华侨大学艺术系女学生向黄沐和献了鲜花。黄沐和怀着激动的心情向黄长水、庄明理等感谢祖国对他的关怀。
    今天到机场迎接的，还有有关方面的负责人张国基、朱毅、陈曼云、张楚琨，以及先期回到北京的中国驻雅加达总领事馆的华侨工作人员。
