    Workers, Peasants and Soldiers are the Backbone of the Great Cultural Revolution
    Many Newspapers in Hebei Province Published a Large Number of Articles by Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Criticizing "Three-Family Village"
    In recent days, more than ten newspapers in Hebei Province, including the *Hebei Daily*, *Tianjin Daily*, and *Hebei Peasant Daily*, have been filled with the voices of workers, peasants, and soldiers angrily refuting the "Three-Family Village." They wrote articles and made speeches to counterattack the frenzied attacks of the escaped rightist Deng Tuo's black gang, and expose the conspiracies of the *Frontline*, *Beijing Daily*, and *Beijing Evening News*, which were tools for opposing the Party and socialism.
    
    The Working Class Vows to Carry the Banner in the Great Cultural Revolution
    Lu Shan, a deputy to the National People's Congress, a famous labor model in Tianjin, and a construction worker, said, "Our working class must not only be the locomotive of the revolution on the political and economic fronts, but also carry the banner in the Great Cultural Revolution, hold high and firmly plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on the cultural front, thoroughly smash Deng Tuo and his gang of black bandits, expose their black talk, and smash their black den. Deng Tuo, who doesn't move his body or shake his arms, what qualifications does he have to talk about protecting labor power in *Yanshan Night Talks*! We working people are the most qualified to talk about this issue! In the old society, I worked for capitalists, signed a contract of indenture, worked sixteen or seventeen hours a day, and the capitalists would kick and punch us at every turn, not treating us as human beings at all. What talk was there of protecting labor power? Deng Tuo! Where were you then? Why didn't you write an article calling on capitalists to protect labor power? It is our great Party and our beloved Chairman Mao who truly care about us and protect labor power." Si Baotong, a famous technical innovation pacesetter and worker in Tianjin, said, "Deng Tuo! Let me tell you, the Party is the lifeline of our working people, and Chairman Mao is closer to us than our own parents. You want to sow discord between us working people and the Party. It's impossible, it will never happen!"
    Li Baitang, a deputy to the National People's Congress and a five-good worker at Kailuan Coal Mine, said, "Deng Tuo and other anti-Party and anti-socialist elements slander our Party's leadership as 'being clever and looking down on the masses.' This is nonsense! The Party consults with us workers in everything. Taking my family as an example, my third brother is a deputy to the district people's congress, my second brother is a representative to the county poor and lower-middle peasants' congress, my younger brother is the director of the people's commune's poor and lower-middle peasants' association, and I was elected as a deputy to the National People's Congress in 1964. We all participate in the management of national affairs. Is this the Party 'looking down on the masses'? This is obviously someone with a political conspiracy, trying to incite the masses to oppose the leadership of the Party. Deng Tuo, you and your gang are the ones who are most afraid of the masses. You use *Frontline*, *Beijing Daily*, and *Beijing Evening News* to peddle your black goods. In this Great Socialist Cultural Revolution, we workers will never allow anti-Party and anti-socialist elements to occupy even an inch of our cultural front. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and repel the frenzied attacks of this small handful of anti-Party black bandits."
    
    Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Will Not Allow Deng Tuo's Black Gang to Touch a Hair of the Party
    Zhang Guishun, the Party branch secretary of the Shashiyu Brigade in Zunhua County, known as the "New Socialist Foolish Old Man," said, "Deng Tuo's attack on the Party is an attack on the people of the whole country, an attack on us poor and lower-middle peasants; Deng Tuo's attack on the Great Leap Forward is an attack on the revolutionary strength of the masses. We Shashiyu people often say, 'Without the Party, there would be no Shashiyu, and without the Party, there would be no Shashiyu people.' Shashiyu was a poor mountain valley in the old society. Of the seventy-eight households in the village, sixty-seven households ate chaff and wild vegetables all year round. After liberation, it was precisely because we listened to Chairman Mao's words and resolutely took the road of collectivization that we transformed the barren mountains and ridges at the foot of the Yanshan Mountains, which created the conditions for fundamentally shaking off poverty. Tremendous changes have taken place at the foot of our Yanshan Mountains, but Deng Tuo and his gang of black bandits are telling lies with their eyes open in *Yanshan Night Talks*. This is a great exposure of their reactionary nature, which tells us that while engaging in production struggles, we must never forget class struggle. We Shashiyu people must actively participate in this Great Cultural Revolution and resolutely overthrow and discredit Deng Tuo and all kinds of anti-Party and anti-socialist demons and monsters."
    Wang Yukun, a national agricultural labor model from the Nanwangzhuang Brigade in Anping County, hailed by the great leader Chairman Mao as the "direction for 500 million peasants," and one of the three poor peasant households who initially resolutely took the road of collectivization, said indignantly, "What kind of vine bears what kind of melon, what class speaks what kind of words. Deng Tuo, this old rightist, is wearing the same pants as the Khrushchev revisionists internationally, and domestically he is wearing the same pants as the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. We poor and lower-middle peasants love the Party the most, love Chairman Mao the most, and love socialism the most. Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party black bandits cannot deceive us, and the fake criticisms and real protection of *Frontline* and *Beijing Daily* cannot deceive us either. We poor and lower-middle peasants have long seen through your tricks. We must thoroughly dig out the roots of the 'Three-Family Village' black den."
    Li Minggui, a poor peasant and old militia hero from Ranzhuang in Qingyuan County, who used the ghostly "tunnel warfare" to severely punish the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries, said, "We poor and lower-middle peasants can see through the masks of Deng Tuo's 'Three-Family Village' black gang at a glance. Their purpose is to make us put down our guns and seals of power so that they can carry out capitalist restoration and let the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists exercise dictatorship over us. We poor and lower-middle peasants in Ranzhuang understand the suffering of the old society the most. Deng Tuo wants to drag us back to the past miserable days. We will resolutely not agree. He said, "Our Ranzhuang militia have not only fought more than 150 major and minor battles with armed enemies, defeating the enemy every time. We have also waged long-term struggles against class enemies such as landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who do not carry guns. Years of struggle experience tell us that no matter what kind of enemy they are, they will not fall if they are not beaten. In this Great Socialist Cultural Revolution, we must also eliminate all demons and monsters as resolutely and thoroughly as we eliminated all class enemies in the past."
    
    Firing Angry "Bullets" at Demons and Monsters
    Wang Liang, a soldier of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, said, "All reactionary things in the world will never voluntarily withdraw from the stage of history. Deng Tuo and his gang of black bandits, using their powers and appearing as 'experts,' 'professors,' and 'authorities,' used Party newspapers and Party journals as their bridgeheads to attack the Party and realize capitalist restoration. This is absolutely not allowed by us. Wherever there is poisonous weed, it must be eradicated there; wherever there is an enemy, that is our battlefront. As a soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I must hold the gun tightly in my hand, not only pay close attention to the enemy with guns, but also be the 'hard bone' of the proletariat in the struggle in the ideological field. In the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution, we must firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, this invincible weapon, carry forward the fighting style of seeing red with bayonets, resolutely smash the frenzied attacks of Deng Tuo's gang of black bandits, hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and carry the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution through to the end."
    Liu Taoshun, a special-class meritorious soldier of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, said, "The current Cultural Revolution, although without gunfire or cannons, is a very sharp and complex class struggle. Because Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements are more insidious, cunning, and vicious than the enemies on the battlefield. We revolutionary soldiers listen to the Party and Chairman Mao the most. Since Deng Tuo has provoked us from an anti-Party and anti-socialist standpoint, our people's soldiers must rise up and meet the challenge. This is a battle without gunfire. In this battle, our people's soldiers will fight against the enemy in a face-to-face battle on the battlefield, and launch a tit-for-tat struggle against the enemy. We are determined to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely fight Deng Tuo, this living target. We will never stop until we overthrow and discredit Deng Tuo's black gang."

### 工农兵是文化大革命的顶梁柱  河北省许多报纸大量发表工农兵批判“三家村”的文章

    工农兵是文化大革命的顶梁柱
    河北省许多报纸大量发表工农兵批判“三家村”的文章
    这些天来，在河北省的《河北日报》、《天津日报》、《河北农民报》等十多家报纸上，充满了工农兵群众愤怒驳斥“三家村”的声音。他们大写文章，大发议论，反击漏网右派邓拓黑帮的猖狂进攻，戳穿反党反社会主义工具的《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》的阴谋诡计。
    工人阶级誓在文化大革命中扛大旗
    全国人民代表大会代表、天津著名劳动模范、建筑工人卢珊说，我们工人阶级不仅要在政治战线和经济战线上当革命的火车头，在文化大革命中，我们也要扛大旗，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗高高地牢固地插在文化阵地上，彻底粉碎邓拓一伙黑帮，戳穿黑话，砸烂黑店。身不动、膀不摇的邓拓，有什么资格在《燕山夜话》里大谈什么爱护劳动力的问题！最有资格谈这个问题的是我们劳动人民！我在旧社会给资本家干活，订了卖身契，一天干十六七个小时，资本家动不动就拳打脚踢，根本不把我们当人看，还讲什么爱护劳动力？邓拓！那时你在哪里，怎么不写篇文章叫资本家爱护劳动力呢？真正关心我们、爱护劳动力的是我们伟大的党，是敬爱的毛主席。天津市著名的技术革新闯将、工人司宝通说，邓拓！告诉你，党是我们劳动人民的命根子，毛主席比亲生父母还亲，你想挑拨我们劳动人民和党的关系，一万个办不到，永远也办不到！
    全国人民代表大会代表、开滦煤矿五好职工李柏棠说，邓拓等反党反社会主义分子污蔑我们党的领导是“自作聪明，看不起群众”，这是胡说八道！党事事都跟我们工人商量。拿我家的情况来说，我三哥是区人民代表大会代表，我二哥是县贫下中农代表大会代表，我弟弟是人民公社贫下中农协会主任，我在一九六四年当选为全国人民代表大会代表，我们都参加了国家大事的管理，难道这是党“看不起群众”吗？这显然是有政治阴谋的人，妄想煽动群众起来反对党的领导。邓拓，你们这一伙人才是最害怕群众的。你们用《前线》、《北京日报》、《北京晚报》来贩卖你们的黑货。在这场社会主义文化大革命中，我们工人阶级决不能让反党反社会主义分子霸占我们的文化阵地的一寸一分，我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，击退这一小撮反党黑帮的猖狂进攻。
    贫下中农不许邓拓黑帮动党一根毫毛
    著名的“社会主义新愚公”——遵化县沙石峪大队的党支部书记张贵顺说，邓拓攻击党，就是攻击全国人民，就是攻击我们贫下中农；邓拓攻击大跃进，就是攻击群众的革命力量。我们沙石峪人常说：“没有党就没有沙石峪，没有党就没有沙石峪人。”我们沙石峪在旧社会是个穷山沟，全村七十八户，有六十七户常年吃糠咽菜。解放后，正是因为我们听了毛主席的话，坚决走集体化的道路，我们改造了燕山脚下的荒山秃岭，才为从根本上摆脱贫困面貌创造了条件，我们燕山脚下发生了翻天覆地的变化，而邓拓这伙黑帮却在《燕山夜话》里睁着眼造谣，这是他们反动本质的大暴露，这正告诉我们，在搞生产斗争的同时，千万不可忘记阶级斗争。我们沙石峪人一定要积极参加这场文化大革命，坚决把邓拓和形形色色反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神，斗倒斗臭。
    被伟大的领袖毛主席誉为“五亿农民的方向”的安平县南王庄大队，当初坚决走集体化道路的三户贫农之一的全国农业劳动模范王玉坤，激愤地说，什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。邓拓这个老右派，是和国际上的赫鲁晓夫修正主义分子穿一条裤子，在国内是和地富反坏右穿一条裤子。我们贫下中农最爱党，最爱毛主席，最爱社会主义，邓拓这伙反党黑帮骗不了我们，《前线》《北京日报》的假批判、真包庇，也骗不了我们，我们贫下中农早已看透了你们的诡计，我们要彻底挖掉“三家村”黑店的根子。
    用神出鬼没的“地道战”严惩过日本侵略者和国民党反动派的清苑县冉庄贫农、老民兵英雄李明贵说，邓拓“三家村”黑帮的画皮，我们贫下中农一眼就看穿了，他们的目的就是要我们放下枪杆子、印把子，由他们来实行资本主义复辟，要地富反坏右专我们的政。我们冉庄的贫下中农最懂得旧社会的苦难，邓拓想拉我们回到过去的苦日子，我们坚决不答应。他说，我们冉庄民兵不光同拿枪的敌人进行过一百五十多次大小战斗，每次都打得敌人屁滚尿流。我们也曾经和不拿枪的地富反坏右等阶级敌人进行过长期斗争。多年的斗争经验告诉我们：不管是什么样的敌人，不打是不倒的。在这场社会主义文化大革命中，我们也要象过去消灭一切阶级敌人一样，坚决地彻底地把一切牛鬼蛇神铲除干净。
    向牛鬼蛇神射出愤怒的“子弹”
    解放军某部战士王良说，世界上一切反动的东西，绝不肯自动退出历史舞台。邓拓一伙黑帮，利用他们的职权，以“专家”、“教授”、“权威”的身份出现，把党报、党刊，作为他们向党进攻、实现资本主义复辟的桥头堡。这是我们绝对不允许的。哪里有毒草，就要在哪里铲除；哪里有敌人，哪里就是我们战斗的前线。作为中国人民解放军的一名战士，我要紧握手中枪，不仅要密切地注意拿枪的敌人，还要在意识形态领域的斗争里当无产阶级的“硬骨头”。在社会主义文化大革命中，我们要紧紧掌握毛泽东思想这个战无不胜的武器，发扬刺刀见红的战斗作风，坚决粉碎邓拓这伙黑帮的猖狂进攻，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把社会主义文化大革命进行到底。
    解放军某部特等功臣刘桃顺说，当前正在进行的文化大革命，虽然没有枪声，没有炮响，但却是一场十分尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。因为邓拓这伙反党反社会主义分子，比战场上的敌人还阴险，还狡猾，还毒辣。我们革命战士最听党和毛主席的话。邓拓站在反党反社会主义立场上，既然向我们挑了战，我们人民战士就要起而应战。这是一场没有枪声的战斗，在这场战斗中，我们人民战士就象在战场上和敌人白刃格斗一样，要对敌人展开针锋相对的斗争。我们决心以毛泽东思想为武器，狠斗邓拓这个活靶子，不把邓拓黑帮斗倒斗臭，决不收兵。
