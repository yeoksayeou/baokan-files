　　Wang Shanfu (Five-Good Soldier, Female Deputy Director of Navigation): Deng Tuo, harboring a deep-seated hatred for the Party and socialism, used the weapon of essays to viciously attack the Party. We must resolutely fight to the end against Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. Who supports our great Party? The masses of the people. Who hates our great Party? All reactionaries at home and abroad and anti-Party and anti-socialist elements within the Party. Deng Tuo's malicious words insulted the great Party and the socialist system, making me extremely angry.

　　Ren Qingfen (Five-Good Soldier, Female Communications Chief): Deng Tuo said the Party "boasts," which is a completely vicious attack, a fabrication! Take our squadron as an example. Under the direct command of the Party Central Committee, we participated in the airdrop to rescue sixty-one class brothers, aided class brothers in Inner Mongolia who were surrounded by wind and snow, went to the Bohai Bay to search for fishermen blown away by a blizzard, participated in disaster relief work in Hebei during the floods, and airdropped antidote medicine in Handan. This year, during the Xingtai area earthquake, we participated in disaster relief work again. Which of these things is "boasting"? Which of these things is "empty talk"? What is unforgettable for us is that one day we escorted a responsible comrade from the Central Committee to Xingtai. This responsible comrade asked us to fly a shorter route and fly there faster. After arriving at the destination, he visited door to door and personally directed the relief efforts. When he came back, he said to us with a smiling face: "With the leadership of the Party, we have complete confidence in rebuilding our homes." Without deep class feelings for the people, could this be done? Deng Tuo, you say the Party does not cherish "the people's strength," isn't that an utter fabrication? We soldiers of Chairman Mao listen most to the Party, and we will not listen to your anti-Party and anti-socialist black words. We must resolutely eliminate your anti-Party and anti-socialist black words.

　　Dai Huanchu (Five-Good Soldier, Navigator): The attempts of *Qianxian* and *Beijing Daily* to cover up for Deng Tuo and his gang are futile, and they cannot deceive the workers, peasants, and soldiers who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The Party has repeatedly taught us not to forget class struggle, not to forget that enemies without guns are still waging a life-and-death struggle with us. If Deng Tuo and this gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs were to succeed, there would be no world for us workers, poor and lower-middle peasants. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, carry the socialist cultural revolution through to the end, seize the seal, and let our workers, peasants, and soldiers control this great seal of ideology to serve socialism.

　　Liu Jinrong (Five-Good Soldier, Instrument Technician): Deng Tuo used the past to satirize the present, bringing up many ancient figures and insidiously attacking the Party and socialism, calling for justice for right-leaning opportunists who had been removed from office. Deng Tuo's methods are very vicious, always talking about ancient people, telling stories, and telling jokes, attempting to use our youth's lack of experience in struggle and lack of historical knowledge to lure us young people to join him in opposing the Party and socialism. Let me tell you frankly, your calculation is wrong. Young people armed with Mao Zedong Thought cannot be deceived. With the weapon of class analysis, all monsters and demons will be exposed. We must respond to the Party's call, expose Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist black words, and dig out Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist black road.

　　Liu Jinzhang (Five-Good Soldier, Pilot): Coincidentally, Deng Tuo's last article in *Yanshan Yuhua* is called "Thirty-Six Stratagems," telling his accomplices to "retreat is best," and to "cooperate with each other" so that they can "retreat safely." In this move, Deng Tuo truly proves himself to be the owner of the "Three-Family Village" black inn, foreseeing their disadvantageous situation. However, instead of honestly surrendering to the Party and the people, thinking that "retreat is best" will not allow you to escape. We people's soldiers must charge forward, intercept your escape route, and seize you to strike you down. Your anti-Party and anti-socialist methods are very "clever," having used "cartoon methods" in the past, and now using the pseudonym "Xiang Yangsheng," "starting from the smallness of flies and bugs, and culminating in the political situation." All this shows that you are a veteran anti-Party and anti-socialist element. Your tricks are useless in front of the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Our air force soldiers respond to the Party's call, and we will not withdraw our troops until we have achieved complete victory.

    我们要掌握意识形态的大印
    ——空军某部五好战士座谈纪要
    王善富（五好战士、女领航副主任）：对党和社会主义怀着刻骨仇恨的邓拓，用杂文这个武器，恶毒地攻击党，我们要坚决同邓拓一伙反党反社会主义分子斗到底。什么人拥护我们伟大的党？人民群众。什么人痛恨我们伟大的党？国内外一切反动派和党内的反党反社会主义分子。邓拓用恶毒的字眼，辱骂伟大的党和社会主义制度，使我非常气愤。
    任庆芬（五好战士、女通信长）：邓拓说党“吹牛皮”，这完全是恶毒的攻击，是造谣！就拿我们大队来说，在党中央的直接指挥下，参加过抢救六十一个阶级兄弟的空投，援救过内蒙古被风雪包围的阶级兄弟的生命，到渤海湾去寻找被大风雪刮跑的渔民，参加河北水灾的救灾工作，到邯郸空投过解毒药品，今年邢台地区地震，我们又参加了救灾工作。这些事，哪一件是“吹牛皮”？哪一件是“说空话”？使我们难忘的是，有一天我们送中央负责同志去邢台。这位负责同志要我们航线飞小些，快些飞到。到了目的地以后，他一家一户地去访问，亲自指挥。回来的时候，他满面笑容对我们说：“有党的领导，完全有信心重建家园。”没有对人民群众的深厚的阶级感情，能够做到吗？邓拓，你说党不爱惜“民力”，不是彻头彻尾造谣，又是什么？我们毛主席的战士最听党的话，不听你的反党反社会主义的黑话，我们要坚决搞掉你的反党反社会主义的黑话。
    戴浣初（五好战士、领航员）：《前线》、《北京日报》替邓拓一伙打掩护是徒劳的，是骗不了用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众的。党一再教导我们不要忘记阶级斗争，不要忘记不拿枪的敌人还在同我们进行拼死的斗争。让邓拓这一伙反党反社会主义黑帮得逞，就没有我们工人、贫下中农的天下。我们一定牢记毛主席的教导，把社会主义文化大革命进行到底，夺过印来，让我们工农兵掌握这意识形态的大印，为社会主义服务。
    刘金荣（五好战士、仪表员）：邓拓借古讽今，抬出了许多古人，含沙射影攻击党和社会主义，为被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子喊冤，邓拓的手法很恶毒，尽搞古人，讲故事，说笑话，企图利用我们青年斗争经验少、历史知识缺乏的弱点，来诱骗我们青年和他一起反党反社会主义，老实告诉你，你这算盘打错了。用毛泽东思想武装起来的青年是欺骗不了的。有了阶级分析这个武器，一切牛鬼蛇神都要现原形。我们一定响应党的号召，揭露邓拓的反党反社会主义的黑话，挖掉邓拓的反党反社会主义的黑路。
    刘金章（五好战士、飞行员）：无巧不成书。邓拓《燕山夜话》最后一篇文章，叫《三十六计》，告诉他的同党“走为上”，要他们“互相配合”，“才能安全退却”。这一着，邓拓不愧是“三家村”黑店的掌柜，预感到他们的不利。但是，不老老实实向党向人民缴械，想“走为上”，是跑不掉的。我们人民战士要打冲锋，截住你的逃路，揪住你打。你的反党反社会主义的手法很“巧妙”，过去搞过“漫画手法”，现在又搞“向阳生”的假名，“发端于苍蝇、臭虫之微，而归结于政局”。这一切，都说明你是反党反社会主义的老手。你这一套鬼把戏，在毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵面前，一概无用。我们空军战士响应党的号召，不获全胜，决不收兵。
