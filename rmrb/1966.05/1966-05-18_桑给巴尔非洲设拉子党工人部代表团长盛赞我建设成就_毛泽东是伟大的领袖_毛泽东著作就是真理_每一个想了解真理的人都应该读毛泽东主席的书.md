    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 17th -- Ali Mdahoma Mlungda, head of the Zanzibar Afro-Shirazi Party Workers' Delegation currently visiting China, told Xinhua reporters here on the 14th that Mao Zedong is a great and wise leader. Everyone who wants to understand the truth should read Chairman Mao's books and listen to Chairman Mao's words. Chairman Mao's works are the truth.
    He said, "I like to read Chairman Mao's works because Chairman Mao's works are the truth. After reading them, I was inspired."
    Mlungda spoke about the great achievements he had seen during his visit to China, achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. He said, "Through this visit, I have seen that China is a country that truly implements the principle of self-reliance. Today, newly independent countries in the world that want to stand on their own feet should take China as an example and adopt the principle of self-reliance." He said, "Whether in factories or in rural areas, the Chinese people are working diligently. They are not working for personal life, nor for bonuses or to be models, but to build their country, so that their country will no longer be bullied by imperialism, and this is due to the strong and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong."
    He praised China's sincere and selfless assistance to the African people. He said, "The Chinese people and the African people are cooperating and consistent. China's assistance to Africa is trustworthy, what is said is done, and this assistance is visible."
    Speaking of the current international situation, Mlungda condemned the new leaders of the Soviet Communist Party for betraying Marxism-Leninism and engaging in the so-called "peace talks" plot on the Vietnam issue. He said, "The people of Zanzibar have learned from their own struggle that the oppressed people cannot hold peace talks with imperialism. The people of Zanzibar achieved victory through armed struggle." He expressed the full support of the Zanzibar people for the anti-American struggle of the Vietnamese people. He said, "Vietnam is the Vietnam of the Vietnamese people. The Vietnam issue should be resolved by the Vietnamese people themselves." He said that all nations and peoples oppressed and exploited by imperialism should, as Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out, form the broadest united front to deal with the aggression of U.S. imperialism.
    Ali Mdahoma Mlungda expressed great indignation at the conspiracies and subversion activities carried out by imperialism headed by the United States in Africa. He said, "The debt owed by imperialism must be repaid, and we African people will certainly make it repay it."

    桑给巴尔非洲设拉子党工人部代表团长盛赞我建设成就
    毛泽东是伟大的领袖　毛泽东著作就是真理
    每一个想了解真理的人都应该读毛泽东主席的书
    新华社上海十七日电　正在我国访问的桑给巴尔非洲设拉子党工人部代表团团长阿里·姆达霍马·姆林达十四日在这里对新华社记者说，毛泽东是一位伟大、英明的领袖。每一个想了解真理的人都应该读毛泽东主席的书，听毛泽东主席的话。毛泽东主席著作就是真理。
    他说：“我喜欢阅读毛泽东主席的著作，因为毛泽东主席的著作是真理。我读了以后，得到了鼓舞。”
    姆林达谈到了他在访问中国期间，看到中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下所取得的巨大成就。他说：“通过这次访问，我看到了中国是真正贯彻自力更生方针的国家。今天世界上新独立的国家想站住脚跟，就要以中国为榜样，采取自力更生方针”。他说：“无论在工厂或农村，中国人民都在勤奋地工作着。他们的工作不是为了个人生活，也不是为了奖金或者当模范，而是为了建设他们的国家，为了他们的国家不再受帝国主义欺侮，而这要归结于中国共产党和毛泽东主席坚强正确的领导”。
    他赞扬中国对非洲人民真诚无私的援助。他说：“中国人民和非洲人民是合作一致的，中国给非洲的援助，是说话算话，说了就做，这种援助是看得到的”。
    在谈到当前国际形势时，姆林达谴责了苏共新领导背叛马克思列宁主义，在越南问题上搞所谓“和谈”的阴谋。他说：“桑给巴尔人民从自己切身斗争中体会到，被压迫人民不能同帝国主义进行和谈。桑给巴尔人民是通过武装斗争取得胜利的。”他表示桑给巴尔人民全力支持越南人民的反美斗争。他说，“越南是越南人民的越南。越南问题应该由越南人民自己来解决”。他说，一切被帝国主义压迫和剥削的民族和人民应该象毛泽东主席所指出的那样，结成最广泛的统一战线来对付美帝国主义的侵略。
    阿里·姆达霍马·姆林达对以美国为首的帝国主义在非洲进行的阴谋和颠覆活动，表示极大愤慨。他说：“帝国主义欠的债一定要还，我们非洲人民是一定要它还的。”
