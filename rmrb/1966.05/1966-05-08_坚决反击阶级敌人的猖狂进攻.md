    Resolutely Counterattack the Frenzied Attacks of Class Enemies
    Chen Jiguang, Train Driver, Shanghai Locomotive Depot
    Recently, a great debate has unfolded on the cultural and academic front, exposing anti-Party and anti-socialist bad operas such as "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," "Xie Yaohuan," and "Li Hui Niang," and criticizing anti-Party and anti-socialist bad movies such as "Besieged City" and "Pulling Soldiers," which made me deeply feel that the class struggle on the cultural front is extremely sharp.
    On this front, the bourgeoisie still has a relatively large influence. Bourgeois intellectuals have so-called knowledge, coupled with the influence of feudalism for thousands of years and capitalism for hundreds of years. Relying on these conditions, they use literature and art as weapons and have launched several frenzied attacks on the Party and socialism on the cultural front in the past ten years. This latest one is more insidious and cunning than in the past.
    When our people across the country are singing "Socialism is good," they shout about the "bitterness and desolation of Jiangnan" and that "the water that carries the boat can also overturn it." When the Party calls on our people across the country to arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, they advocate inheriting the morality of landlords and the bourgeoisie. When Chairman Mao points out that the method of socialist literary creation is the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, they advocate "writing the truth" and "deepening realism." When the Party calls on us to vigorously write about the heroic figures of the proletarian revolution, they propose the theory of writing about "middle characters." When the Party calls on us to use literary works to inspire the people to carry out tit-for-tat struggles against imperialism, they propose the theory of "deviating from the classics and rebelling against the way," that is, deviating from the classics of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and rebelling against the path of people's revolutionary war; and so on.
    The bourgeoisie uses the position of literature and art to sing a duet against the Party and the people! They take that black pen, dipped in the poisonous juice mixed with feudalist ideology, capitalist ideology, and modern revisionist ideology, and vainly attempt to paint our proletarian revolutionary red flag into a black flag. In the past few years, they were so smugly smearing, and praising each other, applauding and shouting, waving flags and shouting, with all kinds of strange tunes howling. The bourgeoisie has used the literary and art position to shoot enough poisonous arrows at us, and their attacks have been rampant enough, which requires us to deal with them seriously. Now is the time for our vast workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary literary and art workers to pick up their pens, step forward, and launch another resolute and powerful counterattack!
    Chairman Mao said in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "To defeat the enemy, we must first rely on the army with guns in their hands. But it is not enough to have only such an army; we must also have a cultural army, which is an indispensable army for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy." According to Chairman Mao's instructions, the "Liberation Army Daily" published an editorial calling on the entire army to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and actively participate in the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution. Just as the People's Liberation Army must not only fight with guns but also with pens, we workers cannot only ask about production struggle but ignore ideological struggle. We railway workers cannot only look at steam engine oil, but also care about the class struggle on the cultural front. We cannot only open the throttle wide, lower the handbrake, and wave the coal shovel, but also hold the gun tightly, pick up the pen, and defend the proletarian seal of power. Our vast workers, peasants, and soldiers must pick up their pens, occupy all cultural positions, and overthrow the monopoly of bourgeois "experts" and "authorities." Every grassroots unit should not only have a "militia company" with guns, but also a "militia company" with pens, and not only a "militia battalion" with guns, but also a "militia battalion" with pens. In this way, if the bourgeoisie launches a frenzied attack from the cultural front, we will cover them in a "net," surround them in a "wall of bronze and iron." The bourgeoisie cannot regain the country with guns, and the bourgeoisie cannot change the color of the country with pens!
    The working class is the locomotive. We should also be at the forefront on the cultural front. We must use the pen given to us by the Party and the people to sing loudly for the heroic figures of our proletariat; use the pen given to us by the Party and the people to fiercely stab the heart of the class enemy; use the pen given to us by the Party and the people to promote the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—the great Mao Zedong Thought; and use the pen given to us by the Party and the people to thoroughly discredit feudalism, capitalism, and revisionist ideology.
    Our revolutionary predecessors used guns and pens to seize the proletarian seal of power, so that the red flag flew high over the land of 650 million Chinese people. We must also hold the gun tightly, pick up the pen, defend our proletarian seal of power, and ensure that our red flag will never change color!

### 坚决反击阶级敌人的猖狂进攻

    坚决反击阶级敌人的猖狂进攻
    上海机务段火车司机　陈继光
    近来，文化学术战线上开展了一场大辩论，揭露了《海瑞罢官》《谢瑶环》《李慧娘》等等反党反社会主义的坏戏，又批判了《兵临城下》《抓壮丁》等等反党反社会主义的坏电影，使我深深感到，文化战线上的阶级斗争是十分尖锐的。
    在这条战线上，资产阶级还有比较大的势力。资产阶级知识分子有所谓知识，加上封建主义几千年和资本主义几百年的影响，他们凭借这些条件，利用文艺这个武器，十几年来，在文化战线上对党、对社会主义发动了几次猖狂进攻，最近这一次比过去更阴险，更狡猾。
    当我们全国人民在高唱“社会主义好”的时候，他们却喊叫什么“江南困苦凄凉相”，“载舟之水也翻舟”；党号召我们全国人民要用毛泽东思想武装头脑，他们却宣扬什么要继承地主资产阶级的道德；毛主席向我们指出社会主义文学创作方法是革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合，他们却宣扬什么“写真实”论，“现实主义深化”论；党号召我们要大写无产阶级革命的英雄人物，他们却提出什么写“中间人物”论；党号召我们用文艺作品鼓舞人民对帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争，他们却提出什么“离经叛道”论，即离马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想之经，叛人民革命战争之道；等等。
    资产阶级就是这样利用文艺这个阵地，与党和人民大唱对台戏！他们拿着那支黑笔，蘸满了封建主义思想、资本主义思想和现代修正主义思想所混合制成的毒汁，妄想把我们无产阶级的革命红旗涂成一面黑旗。前几年，他们就是那么得意忘形地涂抹，并且相互吹捧，鼓掌喊好，摇旗呐喊，各种怪调嗥叫喊成一片。资产阶级利用文艺这个阵地，向我们射来的毒箭够多的了，他们的进攻也够猖狂的了，这就需要我们认真对付。现在是我们广大的工农兵和革命的文艺工作者拿起笔杆，挺身而出，再一次进行坚决有力的反击的时候了！
    毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中说：“我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。”《解放军报》根据毛主席的指示，发表社论号召全军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极参加社会主义文化大革命。正如同解放军不光拿枪杆战斗也要拿笔杆战斗一样，我们工人也不能只问生产斗争，不管思想斗争。我们铁路工人不能两眼只看蒸汽车油，还要关心文化战线上的阶级斗争。我们不能只管满开汽门，放低手把，挥舞煤锹，还要紧握枪杆，拿起笔杆，保卫无产阶级的印把子。我们广大的工农兵一定要拿起笔杆子，占领一切文化阵地，打倒资产阶级“专家”“权威”的垄断地位。我们每个基层单位，不仅要有一支拿枪的“民兵连”，还要有一支拿笔的“民兵连”，不仅要有一支拿枪的“民兵营”，也要有一支拿笔的“民兵营”。这样，资产阶级若从文化战线上发动猖狂进攻，我们就把他们罩在“天罗地网”之下，围在“铜墙铁壁”之中。资产阶级用枪杆子夺不回江山，资产阶级用笔杆子也改变不了江山的颜色！
    工人阶级是火车头，在文化战线上我们也应该冲在最前列。我们要用党和人民交给我们的这支笔，为我们无产阶级的英雄人物高声歌唱；用党和人民交给我们的这支笔，狠狠地刺向阶级敌人的心脏；用党和人民交给我们的这支笔，宣传当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰——伟大的毛泽东思想；用党和人民交给我们的这支笔，彻底搞臭封建主义、资本主义和修正主义思想。
    我们的革命前辈，用枪杆子和笔杆子，夺来了无产阶级的印把子，使红旗在六亿五千万中国人民的国土上高高飘扬。我们也要紧握枪杆子，拿起笔杆子，保卫我们无产阶级的印把子，使我们的红旗永不变色！
