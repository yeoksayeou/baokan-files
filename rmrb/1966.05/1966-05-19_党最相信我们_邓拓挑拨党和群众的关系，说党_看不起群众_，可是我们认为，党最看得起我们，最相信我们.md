    The Party Believes in Us Most
    Deng Tuo provoked the relationship between the Party and the masses, saying that the Party "looked down on the masses," but we believe that the Party looks up to us most and believes in us most.
    5290 Bus Group Driver Leader Sun Wanyou
    Deng Tuo slandered our Party's leadership as "being clever in its own way and looking down on the masses." This is purely an attempt to sow discord between the Party and the masses. I am a train driver, and I have personally experienced that the Party looks up to us the most and trusts us the most. The Party handed a locomotive over to our group of nine people, and we nine people became the masters of this locomotive. All the workers in our locomotive depot are the masters of our depot, and we are also the masters of our country. All the Party's policies and guidelines come from the masses and go to the masses. Our depot holds a Party member representative conference and a worker representative conference every year, allowing us workers to discuss national affairs and discuss plans and guidelines. We feel that the Party looks up to us most and trusts us most, and our Party's leadership is the most deeply rooted in reality and the closest to the masses. The leaders of our depot, the leaders of the bureau, and even the leaders of the Ministry of Railways often come to our group to participate in labor, work with us, and live with us. How much oil we have on us, our leaders also have that much oil on them. They also often visit each of our families to express their concern, which deeply moves us workers and our families. If our Party's leadership were really as Deng Tuo slandered, "being clever in its own way and looking down on the masses," how could they have made these unprecedented achievements? Our Party cadres are the servants of the people, serving the people wholeheartedly, so the people love the Party most and love the Party's leadership. Jiao Yulu is an outstanding example. In history, which party has cared for the people as much as our Party? Deng Tuo, tell us!
    What class speaks what words. Deng Tuo, the "masses" you speak of are just a small group of demons and monsters. What our Party believes in and relies on are the more than 95 percent of revolutionary masses. Of course, we cannot believe in you demons and monsters, we cannot listen to your words, and we also look down on you. We cannot discuss things with you because the people do not trust you and you have ulterior motives. If we listen to you, that means the Communist Party should quickly step down and rest, and you should come to power, hand over the seals, guns, and pens to you, and let you engage in revisionism and capitalist restoration freely, turning the wheel of history backward and making the people return to the old society again.
    As for you, our Party and the people only allow you to be well-behaved and do not allow you to talk nonsense or act recklessly. We are as incompatible as fire and water. Why do you attack the Party, attack Chairman Mao, and attack socialism so viciously? This is due to your reactionary nature. We must not only be the masters and vanguards on the production front, but also the masters and vanguards on the cultural front, sweeping away all demons and monsters and defending the socialist country for ten thousand years!

    党最相信我们
    邓拓挑拨党和群众的关系，说党“看不起群众”，可是我们认为，党最看得起我们，最相信我们
    5290包车组司机长　孙万有
    邓拓污蔑我们党的领导“自作聪明，看不起群众”，这纯粹是想挑拨离间党和群众的关系。我是个火车司机，我亲身体会到党是最看得起我们，最信任我们的。党把一台机车交给我们小组九个人，我们这九个人就成了这一台机车的主人。我们机务段的全体工人就是我们这个段的主人，我们也是我们国家的主人。党的一切方针政策都是从群众中来到群众中去的。我们段每年都召开党员代表大会和职工代表大会，让我们工人讨论国家大事，讨论方针计划。我们感到党最看得起我们，最相信我们，我们党的领导是最深入实际最联系群众的。我们段的领导，局的领导，甚至铁道部的领导都经常到我们的小组里去参加劳动，和我们一起工作一起生活。我们身上有多少油，我们的领导身上也有多少油。他们还时常到我们每个人的家庭去问寒问暖，使我们工人和家属深受感动。如果我们党的领导真的象邓拓污蔑的那样“自作聪明，看不起群众”，怎么能作出这些前所未有的事迹来呢？我们党的干部是人民群众的勤务员，是一心一意为人民服务的，所以人民群众最热爱党，热爱党的领导。焦裕禄就是一个突出的榜样。在历史上有那一个党能象我们党这样关心人民群众呢？邓拓，你说一说我们听听！
    什么阶级说什么话。邓拓，你说的那些“群众”不过是一小撮牛鬼蛇神罢了。我们党相信和依靠的是百分之九十五以上的革命群众，当然不能相信你们这些牛鬼蛇神，不能听你们的话，也看不起你们，有事不能和你们商量。因为人民信不着你们，你们存心不良。如果听你们的话，那就是说共产党赶紧下台休息，你们上台，把印把子、枪杆子、笔杆子都交给你们，让你们自由自在地去搞修正主义，搞资本主义复辟，叫历史车轮倒转，叫人民再重新回到旧社会去。
    对于你们，我们党和人民只许你们规规矩矩，不许你们乱说乱动。我们和你们是水火不相容的。你们为什么这样恶毒地攻击党、攻击毛主席、攻击社会主义，这是由于你们的反动本质支配的。我们不但要作生产战线上的主人和尖兵，也要作文化战线上的主人和尖兵，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，保卫社会主义江山万万年！
