    There are Ghosts Here
    Chen Fa, National People's Congress Representative, Worker Engineer
    On the morning of May 8th, listening to the radio broadcast of the *People's Liberation Army Daily* and *Guangming Daily* articles "Open Fire on the Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Black Line" and "Brighten Your Eyes and Distinguish Between True and False," it was pointed out that Deng Tuo's *Yanshan Night Talks* are thoroughly anti-Party and anti-socialist black words, and everyone should thoroughly criticize this group of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. At the same time, *Qianxian* and *Beijing Daily* were seriously criticized for having long provided cover for Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and others, and are now still using the name of criticism to carry out the reality of cover-ups, raising the banner of struggle while doing the dirty work of shielding. I think the criticism is good, the criticism is correct! Are you not convinced?
    Now I want to ask *Qianxian* and *Beijing Daily*, Deng Tuo is the Secretary of the Secretariat of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC. In the "Three-Family Village" black shop that he opened with Wu Han and Liao Mosha, he was the shopkeeper who had the final say, the head of this small group of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. Why do you insist on putting Deng Tuo in the position of a shop assistant? What is your purpose in doing this?
    I ask you, why did you, in the past few years, allow Deng Tuo and his gang of demons and monsters to release so many poisonous weeds using the Party's newspapers and periodicals (*Qianxian* and *Beijing Daily*)? Where did your standpoint go?
    I ask you, why did you in the past hold back articles criticizing Deng Tuo and others for a long time, refusing to publish them?
    I ask you, why, after the anti-Party and anti-socialist true face of Wu Han was greatly exposed, did you hurriedly publish Deng Tuo's (Xiang Yangsheng) fake critical article, attempting to turn Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist political problem into an academic problem of "moral inheritance theory"?
    I ask you again, why on April 16th did you publish Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist essays *Great Empty Talk* and *Treating "Amnesia"* without criticism? Isn't this re-releasing poison? Why, in so much space across three editions, is there not a single place that talks about Deng Tuo's most fundamental problem of being anti-Party and anti-socialist? I won't say any more about this problem. I'll just ask you to compare the materials published in the *People's Liberation Army Daily* and *Guangming Daily* on *Deng Tuo's 'Yanshan Night Talks' are Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Black Words* with your April 16th newspaper!
    Finally, I ask you again, why are you people eating inside and out, raising the flag of "launching serious criticism of 'Three-Family Village' and *Yanshan Night Talks*," engaging in the dirty tricks of fake criticism, true cover-up, fake struggle, and true shielding? There are ghosts here! Where are the ghosts? The ghost is that your asses are sitting on the benches of the bourgeoisie.

    这里边有鬼
    全国人民代表大会代表、工人工程师　陈发
    五月八日早晨，听电台广播《解放军报》和《光明日报》的《向反党反社会主义的黑线开火》和《擦亮眼睛，辨别真假》两篇文章，指出：邓拓的《燕山夜话》是地地道道的反党反社会主义的黑话，要大家对这伙反党反社会主义分子进行彻底的批判。同时，对《前线》、《北京日报》长期以来，为邓拓、吴晗等人打掩护，现在还在借批判之名，行掩护之实，打起斗争的招牌，干着包庇的勾当，进行了严肃批评。我看，批评的好，批评的对！你们不服气吗？
    现在我要问问《前线》和《北京日报》，邓拓是中共北京市委书记处书记，他在他和吴晗、廖沫沙开设的“三家村”黑店里，是个说了算的掌柜的，是这一小撮反党反社会主义分子的头目。你们为什么偏偏非要把邓拓放在小伙计的地位上？你们这样搞的目的是什么？
    我问你们，为什么你们在前几年叫邓拓这一伙牛鬼蛇神，利用党的报刊（《前线》和《北京日报》）放出那么多的毒草？你们的立场站到哪里去了？
    我问你们，为什么过去你们把关于批判邓拓等人的文章长期扣压起来，不给发表？
    我问你们，为什么在吴晗反党反社会主义的真面目大暴露之后，你们急忙发表了邓拓（向阳生）的假批判文章，企图把吴晗反党反社会主义的政治问题，说成是什么“道德继承论”的学术问题呢？
    我再问你们，为什么你们在四月十六日那天，不加批判地刊登了邓拓的《伟大的空话》、《专治“健忘症”》的反党反社会主义杂文？这不是重新放毒吗？为什么在三个版那么多的篇幅里，没有一个地方谈到邓拓反党反社会主义这个最根本的问题？这个问题我就不说了，还是请你们自己把《解放军报》和《光明日报》发表的《邓拓的〈燕山夜话〉是反党反社会主义的黑话》的材料，和你们四月十六日的报纸对照着瞧瞧吧！
    最后，我再问问你们，你们这些人为什么吃里爬外，打着要“对‘三家村’和《燕山夜话》展开严肃批判”的旗子，搞假批判，真掩护，假斗争，真包庇的勾当？这里边有鬼！鬼在那里呢？这个鬼就是你们的屁股是坐到资产阶级的板凳上去了。
