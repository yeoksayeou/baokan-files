    According to a dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The Japanese Sato government is currently actively planning to convene an "Indonesian Creditor Nations Conference" in Tokyo together with the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries, in order to give the Indonesian right-wing military regime, which is facing a serious economic crisis, a shot in the arm.
    Japanese Foreign Ministry officials revealed to Japanese newspapers on the 27th that the Sato government has begun consultations with relevant countries on the issue of holding the "Indonesian Creditor Nations Conference." These countries include the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and the Soviet Union. The conference will discuss providing new loans to the Indonesian right-wing military regime and extending the deadline for Indonesia to repay its old debts.
    According to a report in the *Nihon Keizai Shimbun* on the 28th, Indonesian Foreign Minister Adam Malik will soon visit Moscow to hold talks with the new Soviet leadership on this issue.
    The Japanese government's initiative is instigated by the United States on the one hand, and has its own intentions on the other. A Kyodo News report on the 27th stated that the Japanese Sato government is actively advocating holding this conference because the United States is requesting the Japanese government to actively cooperate with the United States in assisting the Indonesian right-wing military regime. At the same time, the Sato government believes that the Indonesian right-wing military regime "will play a great role in stabilizing anti-communist politics in Southeast Asia," and that Indonesia is Japan's "potentially most promising market."
    It is reported that Indonesian Fourth Deputy Prime Minister Buwono will visit Japan in mid-May. The relevant departments of the Sato government are studying the issue of providing further assistance to the Indonesian right-wing military regime.

    佐藤积极策划同美苏等国召开“债权国会议”
    竭力想给印尼右派军人政权打强心针
    据新华社东京电　日本佐藤政府目前正在积极策划和美国、苏联等国一起，在东京召开“印度尼西亚债权国会议”，以便给面临严重经济危机的印度尼西亚右派军人政权打强心剂。
    日本外务省官员二十七日向日本报纸透露，佐藤政府已经就举行“印度尼西亚债权国会议”问题，开始同有关各国进行协商。这些国家除美国、英国、荷兰之外，还有苏联。会议将讨论向印度尼西亚右派军人政权提供新贷款和延长印度尼西亚偿还旧有债务的期限的问题。
    据《日本经济新闻》二十八日透露，印度尼西亚外交部长阿达姆·马利克不久将访问莫斯科，同苏联新领导就这一问题举行会谈。
    日本政府的这个倡议，一方面是美国主使的，同时也有它自己的打算。《共同社》二十七日的一条报道说，日本佐藤政府积极倡议举行这个会议，是因为美国要求日本政府在援助印度尼西亚右派军人政权方面同美国积极合作。同时，佐藤政府认为，印度尼西亚右派军人政权“对安定东南亚反共政治，会起很大作用”，而且印度尼西亚又是日本“潜在的最有希望的市场”。
    据报道，印度尼西亚右派军人政权第四副总理布沃诺将在五月中旬访问日本。佐藤政府各有关部门正在研究向印度尼西亚右派军人政权提供进一步援助的问题。
