    This newspaper reports that, according to the American bi-weekly magazine *Challenge* on May 3rd, the "Citizens Opposed to Napalm Committee," composed of New York citizens, recently held a protest demonstration against the use of napalm by the American invading army in South Vietnam. A demonstration composed of a group of women held signs saying "No More Napalm" in front of Citibank in New York. At this bank, a chemical company that manufactures napalm was holding a shareholders' meeting. The demonstrators received support from the masses in the streets.

    Furthermore, according to news from San Francisco, over a thousand residents of Redwood City, California, held a demonstration on May 28th to oppose the Johnson government's war of aggression against Vietnam. The demonstrators arrived at the gate of a factory that manufactures napalm and held a rally there to protest the American war of aggression against Vietnam. Some residents of Redwood City had also demonstrated in front of this factory some days ago. They lay on the ground to prevent trucks carrying napalm bomb casings from moving.

    Xinhua News Agency, May 29th—According to a report in the American weekly newspaper *National Guardian* on May 28th, many family members of American soldiers invading Vietnam and American soldiers who had participated in the war of aggression against Vietnam strongly opposed the Johnson government's war of aggression launched in South Vietnam.

    According to the responses collected by this weekly newspaper, Juanita Butcher, the wife of an American Army sergeant who died on the South Vietnam battlefield, condemned the American government, saying, "This war is useless. My husband's letters during his lifetime said the same thing… We don't know who we are fighting for there, do we? We are shooting and killing people in all directions." She expressed support for the activities of American youths protesting the draft, saying, "The youths who burn their draft cards are not arrogant."

    George C. Newman, the father of George Newman, who died in South Vietnam, said angrily: "I cannot help but think that my son died in vain. This is not our war. Uncle Sam is running rampant everywhere there." (Attached picture)

    The American people demonstrate against the use of napalm by the American invading army in South Vietnam.

    美国公众示威抗议侵越美军使用凝固汽油弹
    侵越美军家属纷纷表示反对约翰逊的肮脏战争
    本报讯　据五月三日美国《挑战》双周刊报道，纽约市民组成的“市民反对凝固汽油弹委员会”最近举行了一次抗议示威，反对美国侵略军在南越使用凝固汽油弹。由一群妇女组成的示威队伍，拿着“不再使用凝固汽油弹”的标语牌，在纽约花旗银行面前示威。在这家银行里，一家制造凝固汽油弹的化学公司正在举行股东大会。示威者受到街头群众的支持。
    又据旧金山消息，美国加利福尼亚州雷德伍德城一千多居民于五月二十八日举行示威，反对约翰逊政府侵略越南的战争。示威者来到一家制造凝固汽油弹的工厂的大门前，并在那里举行抗议美国侵越战争的集会。雷德伍德城的一些居民前些日子也曾经在这家工厂前示威。他们曾躺在地上，以阻止运载凝固汽油弹弹壳的卡车开动。
    新华社二十九日讯　据美国《国民前卫》周报二十八日报道，许多侵越美军的士兵家属和曾经参加过侵越战争的美国士兵强烈反对约翰逊政府在南越发动的这场侵略战争。
    据这家周报收集的反应，一个在南越战场上死亡的美国陆军中士的妻子朱阿尼塔·布彻谴责美国政府说，“这场战争是无益的。我的丈夫在生前写的信件就是这样说的……我们不知道我们在那里为谁而战，可不是吗？我们向四面八方开枪杀人”。她表示支持美国青年抗议征兵的活动，她说，“焚毁征兵证的青年不是狂妄。”
    在南越死亡的乔治·纽曼的父亲乔治·克·纽曼愤怒地说：“我不能不认为，我的儿子白白地死了。这不是我们的战争。山姆大叔在那里到处横行霸道。”（附图片）
