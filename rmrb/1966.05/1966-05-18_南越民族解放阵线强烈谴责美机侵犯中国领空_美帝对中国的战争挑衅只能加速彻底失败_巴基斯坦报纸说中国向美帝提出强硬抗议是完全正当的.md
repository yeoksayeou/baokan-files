    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 17th (electric dispatch) According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the spokesperson of the Foreign Liaison Committee of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front issued a statement on the 16th, angrily condemning the bandit behavior of US imperialism in invading Chinese airspace and shooting down Chinese aircraft.
    The statement pointed out that this is a deliberate and extremely serious act of military provocation, which has grossly violated the sovereignty and airspace of the People's Republic of China, and is part of the US imperialists' ulterior motives to strengthen and expand the war of aggression in Asia in order to salvage the utter defeat of its war of aggression in South Vietnam.
    The statement said that facing China's resolute support for the just struggle of the South Vietnamese people, and proceeding from a policy of hostility towards China, US imperialism has long and continuously dispatched aircraft and warships to invade the airspace and territorial waters of the People's Republic of China. This time, US imperialism directly and openly carried out a crude military provocation against the People's Republic of China, which is a risky and extremely dangerous step in its conspiracy to launch a war against China, seriously threatening peace in Asia and the world. However, this can only lead it rapidly to complete defeat.
    The statement said that the South Vietnamese people and the South Vietnam National Liberation Front are extremely indignant about this, and severely condemn this blatant act of aggression by US imperialism, and fully support the position expounded in the statement of the Spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China on May 12th. The South Vietnamese military and civilians are willing to join forces with the fraternal Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army to resolutely defeat all aggressive conspiracies and actions of US imperialism, in order to completely liberate South Vietnam, further unify the country, and contribute to the defense of Indochina, Asia, and world peace.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 15th (electric dispatch) The Vietnamese newspaper "People's Army Daily" published a commentary on the 15th, strongly condemning the US imperialists' war provocation of openly sending aircraft into the airspace of Yunnan Province, China, on the 12th to attack Chinese aircraft.
    The commentary pointed out that the US imperialists' sending aircraft into the airspace over Yunnan Province, China, and attacking Chinese aircraft that were undergoing training flights is a shameful and despicable act.
    The commentary said that the US imperialists' arrogant actions are closely related to their recent clamor about the "possibility of war with China." This once again proves that the US rhetoric of "improving relations with China" is nothing more than a clumsy trick. The US imperialists' actions to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam and provoke China expose their extremely reactionary and bellicose nature.
    The commentary said that the United States' war actions of provocation and invasion of the airspace of a sovereign country by air force cannot cover up the current failure and predicament of the United States in South Vietnam. These war actions can only lead it to suffer more disastrous defeats and serious isolation.
    The commentary said that the US imperialists' risky attempt to antagonize the powerful 650 million Chinese people will inevitably lead them to destruction more quickly.
    Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, May 16th (electric dispatch) The "Combat" newspaper published an editorial on the 16th regarding the war provocation incident of US aircraft invading Chinese airspace and shooting down Chinese aircraft, saying that the entire world, especially Asian and African countries, strongly condemns this aggressive action taken by the United States against the People's Republic of China. This serious incident also once again proves the US's determination to undermine world peace.
    The editorial said: "The US's naval and air force bases around the world must be dismantled, and the US military must all go back to the United States. This must be done without delay."
    The "Achievement" newspaper's editorial on the 16th, commenting on the incident, said: "People now truly believe that the United States is determined to launch a war against China." "This provocative action by the United States has certainly aroused strong reactions in China, and China's strong protest to the United States is completely justified."
    The editorial warned the United States not to be foolish enough to launch a war against China.

    美帝对中国的战争挑衅只能加速彻底失败
    巴基斯坦报纸说中国向美帝提出强硬抗议是完全正当的
    新华社河内十七日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会发言人十六日发表声明，愤怒谴责美帝国主义侵犯中国领空并击落中国飞机的强盗行为。
    声明指出，这是一种蓄意和极其严重的军事挑衅行为，它粗暴地侵犯了中华人民共和国的主权和领空，并且是美帝国主义为了挽救它在越南南方进行的侵略战争的彻底失败而在亚洲加强和扩大侵略战争的不可告人的阴谋的一部分。
    声明说，美帝国主义面对着中国坚决支持越南南方人民的正义斗争的立场，从仇视中国的政策出发，长期以来，就不断地派遣飞机、军舰侵犯中华人民共和国的领空和领海。这一次，美帝国主义直接对中华人民共和国进行粗暴的公开的军事挑衅，是它在对中国发动战争的阴谋中冒险地跨出了极其危险的一步，严重地威胁着亚洲和世界的和平。但是，这只能使它迅速走向彻底的失败。
    声明说，越南南方人民和越南南方民族解放阵线对此感到无比愤慨，并且严厉谴责美帝国主义这一明目张胆的侵略行动，完全支持中华人民共和国政府国防部发言人五月十二日的声明中所阐明的立场。越南南方军民愿同兄弟的中国人民和中国人民解放军并肩一起，坚决击败美帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋和行动，以便完全解放越南南方，进而统一国家，并对保卫印度支那、亚洲和世界和平作出贡献。
    新华社河内十五日电　越南《人民军队报》十五日发表评论，强烈谴责美帝国主义十二日公然派遣飞机侵入中国云南省领空，袭击中国飞机的战争挑衅行动。
    评论指出，美帝国主义派遣飞机侵入中国云南省上空和袭击正在训练飞行的中国飞机，是一种可耻和卑鄙的行动。
    评论说，美帝国主义的蛮横行动，是同它最近叫嚷“可能同中国发生战争”的狂言密切相关的。这再一次证明美国所说的要“同中国改善关系”的论调，只不过是拙劣的鬼把戏。美帝国主义扩大侵越战争的行动和对中国进行挑衅的行动，暴露了它的极其反动和好战的本质。
    评论说，美国用空军对拥有主权国家的领空的挑衅和侵犯的战争行动，掩盖不了美国目前在越南南方的失败和困窘的处境。这些战争行动，只能使它遭到更加惨重的失败和严重的孤立。
    评论说，美帝国主义冒险要同强大的六亿五千万中国人民为敌，就必将更加迅速地走向灭亡。
    新华社拉瓦尔品第十六日电　《战斗报》十六日就美国飞机侵入中国领空，击落中国飞机的战争挑衅事件发表社论说，整个世界，特别是亚非国家，都强烈谴责美国对中华人民共和国采取的这个侵略行动。这次严重事件也再一次证明了美国一意要破坏世界和平。
    社论说：“美国在世界上的海空军基地必须拆除，美军必须统统滚回美国去。必须毫不迟延地这样做。”
    《成就报》十六日的社论在评论这个事件时说：“人们现在确实相信美国决心要对中国发动战争了。”“美国这个挑衅行动当然在中国激起了强烈的反应，中国向美国提出强硬抗议是完全正当的。”
    社论警告美国不要愚蠢到对中国发动战争。
