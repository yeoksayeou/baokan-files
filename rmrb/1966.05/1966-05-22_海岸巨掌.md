    Coastal Giant Palm
    On the battlefront coastline,
    The night is thick. Our jeep first sped along Highway 1, then turned and headed towards the coastal village of Jingjia County. Not long ago, the people of several coastal townships here engaged in a fierce naval battle with the US aggressors' naval and air forces in order to capture American pilots who were fleeing to the sea.
    When the jeep entered the village road surrounded by green trees, the first impression HI township, the most outstanding in this battle, gave us was an atmosphere of composure and fearlessness. Located on the front line of the battle, the village was full of combat trenches. As we got out of the car, rows of lights lined the roadside, and elderly men, elderly women, and sisters-in-law walked home chatting and laughing, carrying small kerosene lamps.
    The next day, we came to the bustling seaside. On the positions, soldiers and militiamen vigilantly guarded the coastline. Comrade Dao and the deputy township head pointed to the sea in front of us and described the course of the battle that day. A magnificent battle scene appeared before our eyes. I looked at the rows of casuarina trees and cacti beside me, the fine sand and shells under my feet, and thought how much this resembled the coast of CB township, Qiong Liu County, Yi An Province, where we had just been the day before! The comrades here also said that they learned from the experience of CB township and won this battle. The coasts here and the coast of CB township both have mountains or islands at both ends, forming a slight curve. Both places are true coastal giant palms. The enemy's attempt to allow their pilots to escape from here was severely thwarted.
      A Naval Battle for Supremacy
    One day in early February, at 1:00 PM, a batch of American planes invaded the northern sky of Yi An. Before they could bomb, ground anti-aircraft fire shot down one of the American A3D aircraft, setting it on fire. Several enemy planes fled towards the sea in a panic. The one that was hit fell into several pieces and crashed by the sea. After the two pilots parachuted, they desperately fell far into the sea. But when these two parachutes floated over CB township, the cadres and masses who were holding meetings and engaged in production immediately jumped up and rushed to the seaside. As the township head said: "At that time, the whole township rang with urgent drums and bells, but, to be honest, our militia were faster than the bells and drums." When people chased to the seaside, the American pilots had just entered the water and were desperately swimming away from the coast. In just a few minutes, soldiers and militiamen had jumped onto three boats parked on the shore and immediately chased after the American pilots. Just as they left the shore, a swarm of enemy planes roared in, including six AD6 aircraft and two seaplanes. The enemy planes swooped down to threaten, sometimes almost grazing the boats, trying to prevent the wooden boats from advancing. However, the militiamen and soldiers had clearly seen that the two American pilots ahead were one in front of the other, about a hundred meters apart, swimming towards the open sea. The people on the wooden boats were determined to break through the enemy planes' blockade and capture the enemy. The first and second boats were responsible for directly attacking the targets, while the third boat was responsible for covering them. At this time, the first and second boats, commanded by soldier Gao and deputy township head Qi respectively, flew forward quickly, approaching the pilots. In order to eliminate all the enemies, Comrade Gao ordered his boat to let go of the pilot who was behind and intercept the pilot who was in front head-on. Both of these guys were injured, the one in front was a captain, with a minor injury; the one behind was a lieutenant, his right arm was broken, and he was sitting in a rubber dinghy. As soon as the people on the wooden boat shouted surrender in English, these two guys obediently surrendered.
    The two enemy seaplanes were greatly disappointed and flew away dejectedly. The remaining enemy planes continued to block and retaliate. The enemy planes took turns swooping down to bomb and strafe, trying to form an impassable wall of fire in front of the three boats. At this time, there was smoke and water columns in front of and around the wooden boats. The firepower on the boats returned fire at the enemy planes, and the artillery fire from the shore also fired at the enemy planes. The soldiers and militiamen decided to break through the rain of bullets and escort the two American pilots back. In order to cover the victorious return of the first two boats to shore, the third boat, commanded by township militia captain Li, braved danger, stayed behind, and attracted the enemy's firepower in another direction. Swarms of enemy planes concentrated on attacking this boat. Comrade Li directed everyone to shoot at the swooping enemy planes while advancing. At this time, the people on the coastal positions engaged in battle with the swarm of enemy jet planes. On the sea slightly away from the shore, two enemy destroyers opened fire on the shore repeatedly. The shore and the sea were both in fierce fighting. When the first and second boats successfully landed, Comrade Li's boat was still trapped in the enemy's strafing circle, and the boat was damaged. Even so, they were unwilling to abandon the team's boat. They fought and rowed, rowing until the water was shallower, then they got out of the water and stood in front of the boat, using the force of the water to slowly drag the broken boat onto the beach. The artillery fire on the shore gave the enemy planes in the sky a fierce counterattack, and also gave the enemy warships the punishment they deserved. At 4:00 PM, the enemy warship also fled in embarrassment after being hit twice.
      Another Fierce Naval Battle
    Not long after my visit to the coast of CB township, an even larger battle took place off the coast of Jingjia County, Qinghua Province. A fierce battle for supremacy unfolded on this open sea in front of us.
    On March 14, three more American planes invaded southern Qinghua. At 3:15 PM, in the sky near a bridge, an American F-4H plane was hit by ground fire and started to smoke and catch fire. Again, three planes fled towards the sea in a panic. By the time it reached the seaside, the fire on the enemy plane was getting bigger and bigger, and two pilots hurriedly parachuted, one red and one white, one in front of the other, two parachutes falling into the sea together.
    As soon as the enemy's two parachutes floated over the coastal villages here, people who were running and shouting immediately jumped out from the villages, fields, and coastal positions. The militiamen of HI township and nearby soldiers immediately organized three wooden boats and a bamboo raft to go out to sea to chase. Later, three boats from nearby townships also joined the battle. On the boats were young militiamen and soldiers, elderly men, and women who were going out to sea for the first time. Township militia cadres and experienced soldiers served as commanders. Elderly men familiar with the water volunteered to steer. Women automatically took on the work of bailing water and providing medical care, while also carrying guns to prepare for battle. These boats had just reached the halfway point when enemy planes rescuing the pilots also hurriedly arrived. First, seven enemy planes frantically bombed and strafed the sea near the shore and the shore, causing waves to rise and fog to cover the area, making it impossible to see each other clearly on the boats and on the shore. Then more enemy planes arrived. When the enemy planes saw these seven boats heading straight for the target, they desperately bombed and strafed. Helicopters and seaplanes headed straight for the area where the pilots were drifting to rescue them. When the militiamen and soldiers on the wooden boats saw that the enemy was about to take the pilots away, they rowed even harder and fired fiercely, determined to smash the enemy's conspiracy.
    When the enemy pilots were swimming far away, and the helicopters and seaplanes were slowly flying away, trying to rescue them, a wooden boat from HT township rushed head-on from the outer sea. This township also sent out six boats and five bamboo rafts. The boat at the very front, commanded by Comrade Jun, with young militiaman Comrade Xin at the helm, sailed quickly, cutting through the sea where there were enemy warships on the side and enemy seaplanes overhead, blocking the enemy's path.
    This was a tense moment of contention. The enemy's seaplanes landed on the sea to deal with the wooden boats of HI township; the enemy's helicopters also immediately descended, dropping rope ladders to the pilots in the water. The enemy's two warships fired on the coast from both sides, trying to cut off support for the wooden boats. The enemy planes overhead continued to bomb and strafe the wooden boats. At this time, the boats commanded by Comrade Chang of HI township concentrated on attacking the seaplanes. On the other side, Comrade Jun's boat concentrated on smashing the plan of the helicopters to rescue the pilots. The soldiers, militiamen, old men, and women on Comrade Chang's several boats fired at the enemy seaplanes and the planes swooping down from the sky. The huge seaplanes were punished by the firepower of the wooden boats. One of them hurriedly left the water and fled into the distance. Another could not leave, and the firepower of the wooden boats had riddled it with holes. At this time, the artillery fire on the shore gave powerful support. The first and second shots approached the seaplane, the third and fourth shots lightly injured it, and the fifth shot hit the fuselage squarely, and the entire plane burst into flames. Some of the seaplane's pilots jumped into the sea, some climbed onto the wings, and several lost their lives and plunged into the water.
    On the other side, just as the enemy's helicopter dropped a rope ladder to the pilots in the water, Comrade Jun's wooden boat approached. When the pilot climbed to the middle of the ladder, Comrade Jun ordered to fire. The pilot on the rope ladder fell into the water in response to the sound of the rifles on the wooden boat firing in unison. The enemy helicopter hurriedly flew away to escape.
    That day, the armymen and civilians on the shore were supporting the wooden boat team as a powerful backing. The enemy's planes constantly bombed and strafed the positions on the shore, and the enemy warships also cooperated in the attack. However, the armymen and civilians on the shore gave the enemy a fierce counterattack. Braving the enemy's bombs, rockets, and strafing bullets, the armymen and civilians on the shore fought continuously. On the entire seven-kilometer coastline, people were firing at the sky. When swarms of enemy planes were attacking the wooden boats most fiercely, the soldiers and militiamen on the shore, in order to support the wooden boats nearby, bravely rushed to the sea, lined up in the chest-deep water, and fired angry bullets at the swooping enemy planes. Some machine gunners used makeshift wooden frames to support their machine guns, while others relied on people as gun mounts.
      People Who Overawe the Coast
    When I talked to these combatants about this heroic battle, I increasingly felt a tremendous spiritual force in them. It was they who severely struck the enemy, it was they who overawed the coast.
    In the battle on March 14, many families in HI township almost all automatically participated in the battle. Township captain Comrade Chang and his younger brother Jiang each went on a boat to fight on the sea; his younger sister, Aunt Hui, fought on the shore; his sister-in-law, Chen Shi Se, came back from a meeting in another place and, passing by a neighboring township, participated in the work of serving the battle; Aunt Hui's fiancé, Comrade Jia, who was a teacher in a nearby township and had never been to sea, also went to sea to capture pilots that day. Another family was the husband Chuan boarded a boat to capture pilots; his wife, Gao Shi Tan, boarded another boat and was responsible for bailing water and providing medical care; two older children also went to wipe cannons and deliver ammunition for the soldiers. This middle-aged woman took these things very normally. She said: "I just want to fight the enemy. We poor and lower-middle peasants suffered all kinds of bullying in the past, and life has only gotten better after we had a new country. How can we not resist the US?"
    There were also several elderly people fighting alongside young people. Grandpa Cao and Grandpa Jun both automatically jumped on the boat to steer for the young people. They advanced together against the strafing of enemy planes, braving the waves. On the boat of township militia captain Chang, soldiers and militiamen fought together on the sea amidst the raging waves and flying shrapnel. Eighteen-year-old militiaman Gao Wen Tao excitedly talked about this naval battle. This young militiaman said: "From this battle, we see more clearly that we must defeat American imperialism, and we can defeat it."
    As I was about to leave this palm-shaped coast, the waves relentlessly lapped against the beach. Looking at the green fields on the shore, there were countless avenues and small paths. On these roads, as long as there is an enemy coming to the shore, countless angry armymen and civilians will rush quickly. It is not because the coast is like a giant palm, but because these people who hate American aggressors and dare to defeat American aggressors make up the coastal giant palm.

    海岸巨掌
    战斗的海岸线上
    夜色浓黑，我们的吉普车先是沿着一号公路飞驰，然后折个弯，向靖嘉县的海边村庄驰去。不久前，这里沿海几个乡的人民，为了抓向海上窜逃的美国飞行员，同美国侵略者的海空军进行了一场激烈的海上战斗。
    等到车子进入绿树围护的村道，这个战斗最出色的HI乡，首先给我们的印象是那种从容无畏的气氛。这里处在战斗的前沿，村里挖满了战斗的壕沟。我们走下车来，路旁却是成排成串的灯火，老大娘、老大爷和大嫂子们端着小煤油灯，谈笑着往家里走。
    第二天，我们来到喧啸的海边。阵地上，战士和民兵警惕地守卫在海岸线上。道同志和乡副主席指点着面前的海面，叙述那天战斗的经过。一场壮伟的战斗图景呈现在眼前。我看看身旁一排排木麻黄树和仙人掌，脚下的细沙和贝壳，想着这里多象我们前天刚去过的义安省琼琉县CB乡的海岸啊！这里同志们也说他们学习了CB乡的经验，打胜了这一仗。这里的海岸和CB乡的海岸都是两端有山或岛，略呈弯形，两个地方都是真正的海岸巨掌，敌人妄图使他们的飞行员从这里逃脱，都遭到了痛击。
      一场海上争夺战
    二月初的一天，下午一时，一批美国飞机侵入义安北部上空，还没有来得及轰炸，地面防空炮火就把其中一架A3D型美机打得起了火。几架敌机都慌张地向海上逃去。那架被打着的，到了海边已烧成几段坠落。两个飞行员跳伞之后，拼命往海面远处落去。但当这两个伞飘过CB乡上空，正在开会、生产的干部群众，立即一跃而起，纷纷奔向海边。正如乡主席所说的：“那时全乡响起紧急的鼓声、钟声，但是，说真的，我们的民兵比钟声、鼓声还快。”人们追到海边时，美国飞行员刚下水，立即拼命游离海岸。仅仅几分钟战士和民兵已经跳上泊在岸边的三条船，立即向美国飞行员追去。他们刚刚离岸，成群敌机已经呼啸而来，其中有六架AD6型飞机，两架水上飞机。敌机俯冲威胁，有时简直是擦船而过，妄图阻止木船前进。但是，民兵和战士已经清晰地看见，前面两个美国飞行员正一前一后，相距百米，往海外游。木船上的人们决心冲过敌机的阻挡，抓住敌人。第一船、第二船负责直冲目标，第三船负责掩护。这时由战士篙和乡副队长启分别指挥的第一船、第二船疾飞直前，逼近飞行员。篙同志为了全歼敌人，命令自己的船放过落在后面的飞行员，一直向前迎头截住前面的飞行员。这两个家伙都受了伤，前面的是上尉，伤轻；后面的是中尉，右臂被打断，坐着橡皮艇。木船上一用英语喊投降，这两个家伙就乖乖就擒了。
    两架敌人的水上飞机大大扫兴，垂头丧气飞走了。其余几架敌机却要继续拦阻和报复。敌机轮番俯冲轰炸扫射，想在三条船前组成一段越不过的火墙。这时木船前面和四周都是硝烟和水柱。船上的火力向着敌机还击，岸上的炮火也向敌机射击。战士和民兵们决定冲过弹雨押解两个美国飞行员回去。为了掩护前两条船胜利回岸，由乡民兵队长黎同志指挥的第三船冒着艰险，走在后面，并把敌机的火力吸引向另一方向。成群敌机集中打这条船，黎同志指挥大家一面向俯冲的敌机射击，一面前进。这时海岸阵地上的人们同成群的敌人喷气式飞机展开战斗，离岸略远的海面上，又开来两艘敌人驱逐舰，向岸上连连打炮。岸上和海上都处在激战中。等到第一船、第二船胜利靠岸，黎同志的船还陷在敌人的扫射圈里，船打坏了。就这样他们也不肯丢掉社里的船，他们边战斗边划，直划到水较浅的地方，他们才下水站在船前，借着水的冲力一点一点把破船拖上沙滩。岸上的炮火给了天上的敌机以猛烈的回击，也给了敌人军舰以应得的惩罚。下午四时，敌舰在连吃两炮之后也狼狈逃走了。
      又一场海上激战
    在我访问CB乡海岸不久，在清化省靖嘉县海岸前，又发生了一场更大规模的战斗。就在眼前这片开阔的海面上，展开一场激烈的争夺战。
    三月十四日，又是三架美机侵犯清化南部。下午三时十五分，在一座桥梁附近上空，一架F—4H型的美机被地面炮火打得冒烟起火，又是三架一齐慌张向海上逃窜。到了海边，那架敌机上的火越烧越大，两个飞行员慌忙跳伞，一红一白，一前一后，两伞一起往海上坠落。
    敌人的两个降落伞刚飘过这里海岸村庄的上空，从村里、田里、海岸阵地上，立即跃出边跑边喊的人们。HI乡的民兵和附近的战士立即组织了三条木船、一只竹排出海去追。后来，又有附近乡里的三条船也参加了战斗。船上有年轻的民兵和战士，有老大爷，还有第一次出海作战的妇女。乡民兵干部和有经验的战士作指挥。熟悉水性的老大爷自报奋勇把舵。妇女自动分担戽水、救护工作，同时也带枪准备战斗。这些船只刚刚追到中途，抢救飞行员的敌机也匆匆赶来。先是七架敌机向近岸的海上和岸上狂轰滥炸，打得浪起雾遮，船上与岸上互相看不清。接着又有更多的敌机赶来。敌机看见这七条船直奔目标，就拼命轰炸扫射，直升飞机和水上飞机就直奔飞行员漂游的地方去抢救。木船上的民兵战士一看敌人要抢走飞行员，更加奋力划船，猛烈射击，一定要粉碎敌人的阴谋。
    在敌人飞行员往远处游，直升飞机和水上飞机也缓缓远飞、设法抢救的时候，从外面海上迎头冲来了HT乡的一只木船。这个乡也出来六条船，五只竹排。冲在最前面的这只船由军同志指挥，青年民兵心同志把舵。他们扬帆疾驶，从旁边有敌舰、上面有敌人水上飞机的海面插过去，拦住了敌人的去路。
    这是争夺的紧张关头。敌人的水上飞机落在海上，要对付HI乡的木船；敌人的直升飞机也立即下降，向水里的飞行员投下软梯。敌人的两艘军舰从两边向海岸打炮，妄想切断对木船的支援。头上的敌机继续向木船轰炸扫射。这时，HI乡的常同志指挥的船，集中打水上飞机。这一边，军同志的船集中粉碎直升飞机救飞行员的计划。常同志几条船上的战士、民兵、老人、妇女，向敌人的水上飞机和从天空向下俯冲的飞机射击。庞然大物的水上飞机吃了木船火力的惩罚，有一架慌忙离开水面逃向远空。另一架已走不了，木船的火力已把它打穿了许多洞。这时岸上炮火又给了有力的支援，第一、二炮就逼近水上飞机，三炮、四炮使它轻伤，第五炮正中机身，整个飞机燃起大火。水上飞机的驾驶员有的跳海，有的爬上机翼，有几个丧了命栽下水去。
    另一边，敌人直升飞机刚向水里的飞行员投下软梯，军同志的木船就已逼近。飞行员爬上梯子的中腰，军同志下令打，木船上步枪齐发，软梯上的飞行员应声倒栽入水。敌人直升飞机灰溜溜地赶忙高飞逃命。
    那天岸上的军民是作为强大的后盾支援木船队的。敌人的飞机不断轰炸、扫射岸上的阵地，敌人军舰也配合进攻。但是岸上军民给敌人以猛烈的回击。冒着敌人的炸弹、火箭炮、扫射的子弹，岸上军民不断战斗。整个七公里的海岸线上，人们在向天空射击。在成群敌机向木船袭击最凶猛的时候，岸上的战士、民兵，为了就近支援木船，奋勇扑向大海，分列在齐胸深的海水里，向俯冲的敌机射出愤怒的子弹。机枪射手有的用临时找来的木架支着机枪打，有的就是靠人作枪架。
      威震海岸的人们
    当我和这些战斗者谈起这场英勇战斗的时候，越来越强烈地感到他们身上具有一种巨大的精神力量。正是他们狠狠地打击了敌人，正是他们威震海岸。
    在三月十四日的战斗中，HI乡有许多家庭几乎全家自动参加了战斗。乡队长常同志和弟弟江，各上一条船，在海面战斗；妹妹会姑在岸上战斗；他的嫂子陈氏色上外地开会回来，路过旁边的乡，就参加了服务战斗的工作；会姑的未婚夫甲同志在附近乡里当教师，从来没出过海，这天也出海去抓飞行员。另一个家庭是丈夫传上船去抓飞行员；妻子高氏坦上了另一条船，担任戽水、救护工作；两个大点的孩子也去为战士们擦炮、送弹。这个中年妇女把这些事情看得十分平常。她说：“我就想去打敌人。我们贫雇农过去受尽欺侮，有了新的国家后，生活才好起来，我们怎么能不抗美呢”？
    也有好几个老人同年轻人一起战斗。操大爷、均大爷都自动跳上船为年轻人把舵。他们一起冒着敌机的扫射，破浪前进。在乡民兵队长常的船上，战士和民兵在惊涛骇浪、弹片纷飞的海面一起战斗。十八岁的民兵高文桃激动地谈到这次的海上战斗。这个年轻的民兵说：“从这次战斗中，我们更看清了必须打败美帝国主义，也能够打败它。”
    当我要离开这里的掌形海岸的时候，海浪不息地拍打着沙滩。望望岸上绿色的田野，有数不清的大道小路。就在这些道路上，只要一有敌人来到岸前，就会有无数愤怒的军民疾奔而来。不是因为海岸象一个巨掌，而是这些仇恨美国侵略者、敢于打败美国侵略者的人民组成了海岸巨掌。
