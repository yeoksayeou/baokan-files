    Salar People Are Incompatible with the "Three-Family Village" Gang
    Anyone who wants to dismantle the socialist stage and restore the reactionary class will only end up crushed to pieces, just like a toad trying to stop a train by squatting on the tracks!
    Qinghai Salar Youth Teacher Ma Changying
    Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party, anti-socialist elements are妄想attacking and collapsing the Communist Party, attacking and collapsing socialism, so that they can come to power. In a word, it is to engage in capitalist restoration and call us all ethnic groups to return to the old society.
    What does the old society mean to us Salar people? It is the three-way rule of warlords (representatives of the regime), reactionary ahongs (representatives of the upper echelons of religion), and village elders (representatives of the ruling class within the ethnic group). It means the cruel exploitation, oppression, and slaughter of the working people, the massive conscription of soldiers and extortion of funds, and years of continuous disasters.
    The Party and Chairman Mao led us to defeat the exploiting classes riding on our heads, and also led us to fight against heaven, earth, and drought. The Xunhua Autonomous County, where our Salar people have lived for generations, is located on the banks of the Yellow River. The Yellow River flows eastward day and night from its deep riverbed, but the hometown of the Salar people is called "the Yellow River bank where people die of thirst," and called "Dry Xunhua" and "Yellow Xunhua." The ruling class instigated the people to fight for water for them, often resulting in械斗armed fights. At that time, the most common water had many of the most terrible names, such as "water for life compensation" and "water for human heads," and so on. After liberation, the Party led us to build water conservancy projects and organize us to use water rationally. Especially during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Salar people broke superstitions, opened the mouth of the Yellow River from the far upper reaches, and began to build the wide and long Huangfeng Canal. Over the past few years, the Huangfeng Canal water conservancy project has been gradually completed, and the hometown of the Salar people has basically changed its drought-stricken appearance, becoming "Water Xunhua" and "Green Xunhua," and the county seat also has tap water.
    We Salar people have tasted the bitterness of the old society and know the sweetness of the new society best. With the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and socialism, the Salar people have the happy life they have today. The following words are widely circulated in our Salar area: The Communist Party is our great savior, Chairman Mao is the sun in our hearts, and the socialist system is the lifeline of our lives. We have extremely deep class feelings for the Party, for Chairman Mao, and for socialism. Deng Tuo and his gang dared to attack our savior, trying to cover up our sun, to move our lifeline, and want us to return to the fire pit of the old society.呸！呸！A ten thousand times no! We are incompatible with them and must fight resolutely, in a life-and-death struggle.
    I am the first generation of Salar intellectuals cultivated by the Party, a people's teacher. In this class struggle to defend socialism, I must stand at the forefront. I will not give up until I defeat Deng Tuo and his gang. In my work, I must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, promote Mao Zedong Thought more widely, educate minority youth, understand class and class struggle, polish the guns of thought, not let go of any anti-Party and anti-socialist monsters and demons, and continuously consolidate and expand the陣地 position of Mao Zedong Thought. Anyone who wants to dismantle the socialist stage and restore the reactionary class will only end up crushed to pieces, just like a toad trying to stop a train by squatting on the tracks!

    撒拉族人民与“三家村”黑帮势不两立
    谁想拆社会主义的台，想叫反动阶级复辟，谁将同癞蛤蟆蹲在铁轨上想挡住火车一样，只会落得粉身碎骨
    青海撒拉族青年教师　马昌英
    邓拓一伙反党反社会主义分子，妄想攻垮共产党，攻垮社会主义，好让他们上台。一句话，就是想搞资本主义复辟，叫我们各民族重新退到旧社会去。
    旧社会，对我们撒拉族人民来说，意味着什么呢？就是军阀（政权代表）、反动阿訇（宗教上层代表）、乡爷
  （民族内部的统治阶级代表）三结合的统治，是对劳动人民的残酷剥削、压迫和屠杀，是大量的拨兵和派款，是连年不断的灾难。
    党和毛主席领导我们打垮了骑在头上的剥削阶级，又领导我们斗天斗地斗旱灾。我们撒拉族世代居住的循化自治县就在黄河边上，黄河水日夜从深深的河床里哗哗向东流，撒拉族的故乡却被叫做“渴死人的黄河边”，叫做“干循化”、“黄循化”。统治阶级唆使人民为他们抢水常常发生械斗。那时候，最普通的水都有着许多最可怕的名字，如“偿命水”、“人头水”，等等。解放以后，党领导我们兴修水利，组织我们合理用水，特别是在一九五八年大跃进期间，撒拉族人民破除迷信，从远远的上游打开黄河口，开始修筑又宽又长的黄丰渠。几年来，黄丰渠水利工程逐渐配套，撒拉族的故乡基本改变了干旱面貌，成了“水循化”、“绿循化”，县城也有了自来水。
    我们撒拉族人民饱尝了旧社会的苦，最懂得新社会的甜。有了共产党、毛主席和社会主义，撒拉族人民才有今天幸福的生活。我们撒拉族地区普遍流传着这样几句话：共产党是我们的大救星，毛主席是我们心中的太阳，社会主义制度是我们的命根子。我们对党、对毛主席、对社会主义怀着极深厚的阶级感情。邓拓一伙竟敢攻击我们的救星，想遮住我们的太阳，要动我们的命根子，想叫我们重新回到旧社会的火坑，呸！一万个不行！我们同他们势不两立，一定要坚决斗争，拼个你死我活。
    我是党一手培养出来的撒拉族第一代知识青年，是一个人民教师，在这场捍卫社会主义的阶级斗争中，一定站在最前列，不斗垮邓拓一伙，誓不罢休。在工作中，我一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更广泛地宣传毛泽东思想，教育少数民族青少年，懂得阶级和阶级斗争，擦亮思想上的枪，不放过任何一伙反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神，不断巩固和扩大毛泽东思想的阵地。谁想拆社会主义的台，想叫反动阶级复辟，谁将同癞蛤蟆蹲在铁轨上想挡住火车一样，只会落得粉身碎骨！
