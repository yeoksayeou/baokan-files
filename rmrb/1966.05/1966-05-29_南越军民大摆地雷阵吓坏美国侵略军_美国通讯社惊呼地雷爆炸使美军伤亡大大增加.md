    Saigon Dispatch: The South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces skillfully lay minefields in various places, killing and wounding a large number of American aggressors.

    The Associated Press recently admitted in a report that the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces used mines with "great accuracy" and "achieved amazing results." Some of these mines were seized from the US military, but most were locally made.

    According to this news agency, the minefields laid by the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces were so cleverly placed that they not only terrified the American troops who went out to "mop up," but also frequently exploded in the positions defended by the American troops. The report said, "Every American combat unit sweeping through the jungles and rice paddies of Vietnam has had some of its men killed or wounded by cleverly concealed mines and punji stick pits." "Recently, the Viet Cong have often liked to climb to within a few yards of the American defense perimeter, lay remote-controlled mines, and then go back and wait. When the Americans come out of their foxholes to eat breakfast or go out on patrol in the morning, these mines explode." "Other mines are buried in traps, paths, or streambeds."

    The report said that the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces' "use of mines and accurate sniper fire has greatly increased the number of American casualties," and "the proportion of deaths among the casualties has also increased." (Attached picture)

    南越军民大摆地雷阵吓坏美国侵略军
    美国通讯社惊呼地雷爆炸使美军伤亡大大增加
    新华社讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量在各地巧布地雷阵，大量杀伤美国侵略军。
    合众国际社最近在一篇报道中承认，越南南方解放武装力量使用地雷“非常准确”，“并且取得了惊人的结果”。这些地雷有的是从美军缴获的，但是大多数都是土造的。
    据这家通讯社透露，越南南方解放武装力量布得非常巧妙的地雷阵，不仅炸得外出“扫荡”的美军非常害怕，而且在美军防守的阵地上也经常有地雷爆炸。报道说，“在越南丛林和稻田里扫荡的每支美国作战部队，都有一些人被隐蔽的非常巧妙的地雷和尖桩板坑搞死或搞伤。”“最近，越共总喜欢爬到距离美国防御圈阵地只有几码的地方，埋设遥控地雷，然后回去等待。天亮后当美国人走出他们的散兵坑吃早饭或出去巡逻时，这些地雷就爆炸了。”“另外一些地雷埋在陷阱里、小路上或小河河床里。”
    报道说，越南南方解放武装力量“使用地雷和准确的狙击火力的结果，使美军伤亡数目大大增加”，而且“伤亡人数中死的比例也增大了”。（附图片）
