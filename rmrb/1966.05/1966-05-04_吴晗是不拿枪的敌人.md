    "The gates of government offices face south, no money, no justice." You, Wu Han, a self-proclaimed "historian," don't you know this widely circulated proverb from the old society? Today, when we are vigorously carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction, Wu Han dug up Hai Rui, who died hundreds of years ago, and put him on stage to promote that Hai Rui was an "upright official," that he "petitioned for the people," that he "redressed unjust grievances for the people"... Wu Han, through Hai Rui's mouth, spoke words against the Party and against socialism, which made us very angry. These days, the members of our Xigou Brigade have held discussions. Everyone said that Wu Han used the method of borrowing a corpse to return the soul, to "redress the grievances" for the overthrown landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, to "appeal for justice" for the right-leaning opportunists who had been dismissed from office, and to "return land" for the spontaneous forces of capitalism. In a word, he just doesn't want us to take the socialist road, wants us to abandon class struggle, and let the class enemies we have overthrown stage a comeback. This idea will never work! Not in a thousand years, not in ten thousand years!
    Hai Rui was a loyal minister of the feudal emperors, a bureaucrat who maintained feudal rule. But Wu Han said that Hai Rui was a "resolute and unyielding," "enforcing the law like a mountain" great man, the "savior" of the working people. This is simply a reversal of right and wrong, calling a deer a horse, a pack of lies, and a great insult to our working people. In the old society, how many working people were torn apart and their families ruined under the cruel exploitation and oppression of the ruling class? How many people were innocently victimized and died with grievances? Who ever "petitioned for the people" or "appealed for justice"? The people and the ruling class have always been irreconcilable and cannot coexist. To call us to refer to Hai Rui, the representative of the feudal ruling class, as "Father Hai" is daydreaming, it is wishful thinking! Let's not talk about anything else, we have tasted enough of the flavor of the landlords and bureaucrats exploiting and oppressing us before liberation. My family's history of blood and tears for generations, I will never forget in this life, and my children and grandchildren will never forget it.
    My family was originally in Lin County, Henan Province. There were many people in the family but little land, and coupled with the exploitation of landlords' usury, we were so poor that the bottom of the pot was facing the sky. At the age of eleven (1925), I followed my father up the Taihang Mountains to work as a short-term laborer in Jincheng. My father was a good carpenter, working all day long, but he couldn't even support me. In those years of war and chaos, in the dog-eat-dog fight between the Chiang and Yan bandits, my father was seized to repair the city walls. The supervisors deducted wages, insisting that my father had deceived the government and refused to calculate his wages. My father reasoned with them, but they drove my father out. My father was furious and sued in the county government, but the supervisors had already secretly divided the wages with the county magistrate. My father didn't win the lawsuit, but instead ended up with the crime of "delaying the project and deceiving the government" and was imprisoned in the detention center. The next year, my family fled the famine to Xigou in Pingshun County, renting the land of landlords. Who knew that the tiger in the east mountain eats people, and the tiger in the west mountain also eats people. The landlords of Pingshun were as evil as the landlords of Lin County. Sowing in spring and harvesting in autumn, working for a year, and after paying the rent in autumn, there was not even enough to eat in winter. In order to find money to support his family, my father went to Jincheng for the second time, but there was no news for half a year. The next year, I found out that my father had been beaten to death by the rich man "Stinky Bedbug." It turned out that my father was building a house for him, and when calculating wages, "Stinky Bedbug" was bullying and acting like a rascal. My father refused to accept it and reasoned with him, and was beaten to death by "Stinky Bedbug." At that time, I also wanted to sue, but I thought it was useless. Last year, my father didn't end well in the lawsuit, and this time it would be no different. My mother said to me: "Child, swallow your teeth and blood, who will feel sorry if we cry to death? Remember how your father died. As long as our mother and daughter have a breath, we will avenge your father." The evil old society took my father's life and forced my family to a dead end. How can I forget this blood feud! Class bitterness, national hatred, we poor and lower-middle peasants understand the deepest, who to love, who to hate, we know best in our hearts. Wu Han exhausted all his strength to praise Hai Rui, to whitewash the right-leaning opportunism of the bourgeoisie. This can only be like lifting a rock to crush one's own foot, further exposing one's reactionary essence.
  Chairman Mao said: "After the enemies with guns have been wiped out, there will still be enemies without guns. They will inevitably wage a desperate struggle against us, and we must never underestimate these enemies." In 1961, when our country encountered temporary difficulties, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries staged an anti-China chorus, and domestic monsters and demons also came out together, blowing up the "reversal wind" and the "going it alone wind." They openly opposed the people's commune, shouting "land should be returned to individual households." At this time, Wu Han fanned the flames for the class enemies, offered advice and suggestions, shouting loudly, asking us to return the "land" of the people's commune to the landlords and rich peasants. He vainly attempted to make the people's commune collapse, so that we would return to the old road of capitalism and be oppressed and ruled by Wu Han and his anti-Party and anti-people "upright official" masters. In order to provoke the close relationship between the people and the Party, Wu Han made up some nonsense such as "the people's corvée is much more than usual now," "making the common people poor," to confuse the masses. Is the people's commune really "bad"? Are the members really "poor"? Let the facts speak for themselves. Our Xigou Brigade is a mountainous area. Of the brigade's more than 1,500 mu of cultivated land, three-quarters of the land is divided into seventy or eighty pieces per mu, hanging on the mountainside in a fragmented manner. Before liberation, there were no trees on the mountains, and everywhere was a barren mountain. There was no water in the river ditches, and everywhere were pebbles. After a heavy rain, mountain torrents erupted, land was washed away, houses collapsed, and people and animals were harmed. The few acres of thin land became thinner and thinner, and this place became poorer and poorer. Except for a few landlords and rich peasants who spent lavishly, eating and drinking without worry, 70 to 80 percent of the poor people ate bran and wild vegetables, and their lives were difficult to maintain, and they had to separate from their wives and children and flee elsewhere. After liberation, especially since the communization, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, relying on the powerful force of the collective economy, and carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance, the people of Xigou have built the poor mountain gully, which lacked all five elements of "gold, wood, water, fire, and earth," into a new socialist countryside. The former dry riverbed has now been built into 300 mu of grain fields and 200 mu of apple orchards. More than 10,000 mu of barren mountains have been planted with pine and cypress trees, and thousands of mu of barren slopes have also been planted with pasture, basically achieving that the soil does not go down the mountain and the water does not leave the ditch. The mountains have changed, and the land has also changed. In 1964, the grain yield per mu reached 601 jin. Last year, we suffered from a once-in-a-century drought, and the grain yield per mu still reached 481 jin. There has also been great development in large livestock and sheep. The lives of the members have been significantly improved. The whole brigade has more than 1,400 people, eating and wearing well, and most members have savings and surplus grain at home. The lives of the masses have improved, and the contribution to the country is greater, which is very natural. Two societies, two different lives, we poor and lower-middle peasants are very clear in our hearts, and we will never allow Wu Han to talk nonsense.
    Chairman Mao told us: "It is a good thing, not a bad thing, to be opposed by the enemy." Wu Han spent a lot of effort to praise Hai Rui. However, in the eyes of the revolutionary people, Hai Rui can only be a representative figure of feudal forces and will never become the "savior" of the people. Wu Han's scolding of our Communist Party will only make the Party even greater in the eyes of the people. The members of our Xigou Brigade all expressed that they will resolutely read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, farm for the revolution, farm scientifically, and build our Xigou even better as quickly as possible. We will support national construction, support world revolution, defend the Party and socialism with practical actions, resolutely fight to the end against all class enemies at home and abroad, and fight to the end against Wu Han, who speaks for the right-leaning opportunists of the bourgeoisie.

    吴晗是不拿枪的敌人
             平顺县西沟公社西沟大队长　李顺达
      “天下衙门朝南开，有理无钱莫进来。”这句在旧社会广为流传的谚语，自称“历史学家”的吴晗，你难道不知道吗？当我们轰轰烈烈地进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的今天，吴晗却把死了好几百年的海瑞挖出来搬上舞台，向人们宣传海瑞是个“清官”呀，“为民请命”呀！“为民平冤狱”呀……吴晗借海瑞的嘴，说反党反社会主义的话，使我们十分生气。这些天，我们西沟大队的社员开了讨论会。大家都说，吴晗用借尸还魂的办法，为打倒了的地、富、反、坏“平冤狱”，为罢了官的右倾机会主义分子“申冤”，为资本主义自发势力
  “退田”。一句话说破，他就是不要我们走社会主义道路，让我们放弃阶级斗争，让被我们打倒了的阶级敌人卷土重来。这个主意永远办不到！一千年不行，一万年也不行！
    海瑞是封建帝王的忠臣，是维护封建统治的官僚。可是，吴晗却说什么海瑞是个“刚直不阿”，“执法如山”的大丈夫，是劳动人民的“救星”。这简直是颠倒黑白，指鹿为马的一派胡言，是对我们劳动人民的极大侮辱。在旧社会，有多少劳动人民在统治阶级的残酷剥削和压迫下，妻离子散，家破人亡？有多少人无辜受害，含冤而死，有谁为人民“请过命”“申过冤”？人民与统治阶级向来是势不两立，不共戴天的。叫我们把封建统治阶级的代表海瑞称为“海父”，是大白天作梦，是妄想！别的咱不说，解放前地主官僚剥削压迫我们的滋味是尝够了。我家祖祖辈辈的血泪史，我这辈子忘不了，我的儿孙后代也永远忘不了。
    我家原在河南林县，家里人多地少，加上地主高利贷的盘剥，穷得锅底朝天。十一岁那年（一九二五年），我就跟爹爬上太行山，到晋城打短工。爹是个好木匠，整天干活，可连我也养活不住。那年头兵荒马乱，蒋、阎匪打狗咬狗的仗，我爹被抓去修城墙。监工的克扣工钱，硬说我爹欺骗官家，不给算工钱。爹跟他讲理，他们却把我爹赶出门去。我爹气极了，告到县衙里，谁知监工的早与县官把工钱私分了。我爹官司没打赢，反而落得个“贻误工程，欺骗官家”的罪名，被关进了看守所。第二年，我家逃荒来到平顺县西沟，租种地主的地。谁知东山老虎吃人，西山老虎也吃人，平顺的地主和林县的地主一样恶。春种秋收劳动一年，秋后交了租，就连冬天也不够吃。我爹为了找个钱养活全家，又二次到了晋城，谁知一去半年没个音讯。第二年，我才打听到我爹给财主“臭壁虱”打死了。原来爹给他盖房子，在算工资的时候，“臭壁虱”欺行霸市，一派无赖，我爹不服，和他讲理，就被“臭壁虱”活活打死。当时我也想去告状，可一想没用，去年爹打官司就没落得好下场，这次也不会有两样。妈对我说：“孩子，打落门牙和血吞，咱哭死，谁心痛，要记住你爹是怎样死的。只要咱娘儿有口气，就要给你爹报仇。”万恶的旧社会夺去了我父亲的生命，逼得我一家走投无路，这血海深仇我怎能忘得了！阶级苦，民族恨，我们贫下中农体会得最深，该对谁爱，该对谁恨，我们的心里最清楚。吴晗使出了吃奶的力气，吹捧海瑞，为资产阶级的右倾机会主义涂脂抹粉，这只能是自己搬起石头砸自己的脚，更加暴露自己的反动本质。
  毛主席说：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”一九六一年，当我国遇到暂时困难时，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派演出了反华大合唱，国内的牛鬼蛇神也一齐出笼，刮起了“翻案风”，“单干风”。他们公开反对人民公社化，喊叫“土地放到户”。在这时候，吴晗为阶级敌人煽风点火，出谋献计，大叫大嚷，让我们把人民公社的“田”退给地主富农。他妄想使人民公社垮台，使我们重新回到资本主义的老路上，去受吴晗他们这些反党反人民的“清官”大老爷的压迫和统治。吴晗为了挑拨人民和党的密切关系，编出一派什么“现在人民的赋役要比平常多许多”，
  “弄的老百姓穷光光的”，等胡言乱语，来迷惑群众。人民公社真的搞“糟”了吗？社员真的是“穷光光的”吗？还是让事实来说话吧。我们西沟大队是一个山地方。全大队一千五百余亩耕地，就有四分之三的耕地，一亩分成七八十块，七零八碎地挂在山腰上。解放前，山上没有树，到处是一片荒山秃岭。河沟里没有水，到处是河卵石。下一场大雨，山洪瀑发，地冲房倒，人畜遭害。几亩薄地越冲越薄，这个地方也越来越穷。除几户地主、富农花天酒地，吃穿不愁外，百分之七八十的穷苦人吃糠咽菜，生命难保，不得不妻离子散，逃荒在外。解放后，尤其是公社化以来，我们西沟人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，依靠集体经济的强大威力，发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神，把“金、木、水、火、土”五行俱缺的穷山沟，建设成了社会主义新农村。从前的干河滩，现在建成了三百亩粮田和二百亩苹果园，一万余亩荒山已长满了松柏树，几千亩荒坡也种上了牧草，基本上做到了土不下山，水不出沟。山变了，地也变了。一九六四年粮食亩产量达到了六百零一斤，去年遭到了百年不遇的大旱，粮食亩产仍然达到了四百八十一斤，大牲畜和猪羊也有了很大的发展。社员的生活有了显著的提高。全大队一千四百多口人，吃穿富裕，大多数社员家里有了存款和余粮。群众的生活提高了，对国家的贡献也就大了，这是很自然的事。两个社会，两样生活，我们贫、下中农心里非常清楚，决不容许吴晗胡说八道。
    毛主席告诉我们：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。”吴晗费了九牛二虎的力气吹捧海瑞。然而，海瑞在革命人民的心目中，只能是一个封建势力的代表人物，永远也变不成人民的“救星”。吴晗破口大骂我们共产党，也只会使党在人民心目中更加伟大。我们西沟大队社员都表示，坚决读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，为革命种田，用科学种田，用尽快的速度把我们西沟建设得更好。我们要支援国家建设，支援世界革命，用实际行动捍卫党和社会主义，坚决同国内外一切阶级敌人斗争到底，同代表资产阶级右倾机会主义分子说话的吴晗斗争到底。
