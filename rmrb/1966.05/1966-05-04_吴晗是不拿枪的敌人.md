Title: Wu Han is an Enemy Without a Gun

    "The gates of government offices face south, no money, no justice." You, Wu Han, a self-proclaimed "historian," don't you know this widely circulated proverb from the old society? Today, when we are vigorously carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction, Wu Han dug up Hai Rui, who died hundreds of years ago, and put him on stage to promote that Hai Rui was an "upright official," that he "petitioned for the people," that he "redressed unjust grievances for the people"... Wu Han, through Hai Rui's mouth, spoke words against the Party and against socialism, which made us very angry. These days, the members of our Xigou Brigade have held discussions. Everyone said that Wu Han used the method of borrowing a corpse to return the soul, to "redress the grievances" for the overthrown landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, to "appeal for justice" for the right-leaning opportunists who had been dismissed from office, and to "return land" for the spontaneous forces of capitalism. In a word, he just doesn't want us to take the socialist road, wants us to abandon class struggle, and let the class enemies we have overthrown stage a comeback. This idea will never work! Not in a thousand years, not in ten thousand years!
    Hai Rui was a loyal minister of the feudal emperors, a bureaucrat who maintained feudal rule. But Wu Han said that Hai Rui was a "resolute and unyielding," "enforcing the law like a mountain" great man, the "savior" of the working people. This is simply a reversal of right and wrong, calling a deer a horse, a pack of lies, and a great insult to our working people. In the old society, how many working people were torn apart and their families ruined under the cruel exploitation and oppression of the ruling class? How many people were innocently victimized and died with grievances? Who ever "petitioned for the people" or "appealed for justice"? The people and the ruling class have always been irreconcilable and cannot coexist. To call us to refer to Hai Rui, the representative of the feudal ruling class, as "Father Hai" is daydreaming, it is wishful thinking! Let's not talk about anything else, we have tasted enough of the flavor of the landlords and bureaucrats exploiting and oppressing us before liberation. My family's history of blood and tears for generations, I will never forget in this life, and my children and grandchildren will never forget it.
    My family was originally in Lin County, Henan Province. There were many people in the family but little land, and coupled with the exploitation of landlords' usury, we were so poor that the bottom of the pot was facing the sky. At the age of eleven (1925), I followed my father up the Taihang Mountains to work as a short-term laborer in Jincheng. My father was a good carpenter, working all day long, but he couldn't even support me. In those years of war and chaos, in the dog-eat-dog fight between the Chiang and Yan bandits, my father was seized to repair the city walls. The supervisors deducted wages, insisting that my father had deceived the government and refused to calculate his wages. My father reasoned with them, but they drove my father out. My father was furious and sued in the county government, but the supervisors had already secretly divided the wages with the county magistrate. My father didn't win the lawsuit, but instead ended up with the crime of "delaying the project and deceiving the government" and was imprisoned in the detention center. The next year, my family fled the famine to Xigou in Pingshun County, renting the land of landlords. Who knew that the tiger in the east mountain eats people, and the tiger in the west mountain also eats people. The landlords of Pingshun were as evil as the landlords of Lin County. Sowing in spring and harvesting in autumn, working for a year, and after paying the rent in autumn, there was not even enough to eat in winter. In order to find money to support his family, my father went to Jincheng for the second time, but there was no news for half a year. The next year, I found out that my father had been beaten to death by the rich man "Stinky Bedbug." It turned out that my father was building a house for him, and when calculating wages, "Stinky Bedbug" was bullying and acting like a rascal. My father refused to accept it and reasoned with him, and was beaten to death by "Stinky Bedbug." At that time, I also wanted to sue, but I thought it was useless. Last year, my father didn't end well in the lawsuit, and this time it would be no different. My mother said to me: "Child, swallow your teeth and blood, who will feel sorry if we cry to death? Remember how your father died. As long as our mother and daughter have a breath, we will avenge your father." The evil old society took my father's life and forced my family to a dead end. How can I forget this blood feud! Class bitterness, national hatred, we poor and lower-middle peasants understand the deepest, who to love, who to hate, we know best in our hearts. Wu Han exhausted all his strength to praise Hai Rui, to whitewash the right-leaning opportunism of the bourgeoisie. This can only be like lifting a rock to crush one's own foot, further exposing one's reactionary essence.
  Chairman Mao said: "After the enemies with guns have been wiped out, there will still be enemies without guns. They will inevitably wage a desperate struggle against us, and we must never underestimate these enemies." In 1961, when our country encountered temporary difficulties, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries staged an anti-China chorus, and domestic monsters and demons also came out together, blowing up the "reversal wind" and the "going it alone wind." They openly opposed the people's commune, shouting "land should be returned to individual households." At this time, Wu Han fanned the flames for the class enemies, offered advice and suggestions, shouting loudly, asking us to return the "land" of the people's commune to the landlords and rich peasants. He vainly attempted to make the people's commune collapse, so that we would return to the old road of capitalism and be oppressed and ruled by Wu Han and his anti-Party and anti-people "upright official" masters. In order to provoke the close relationship between the people and the Party, Wu Han made up some nonsense such as "the people's corv√©e is much more than usual now," "making the common people poor," to confuse the masses. Is the people's commune really "bad"? Are the members really "poor"? Let the facts speak for themselves. Our Xigou Brigade is a mountainous area. Of the brigade's more than 1,500 mu of cultivated land, three-quarters of the land is divided into seventy or eighty pieces per mu, hanging on the mountainside in a fragmented manner. Before liberation, there were no trees on the mountains, and everywhere was a barren mountain. There was no water in the river ditches, and everywhere were pebbles. After a heavy rain, mountain torrents erupted, land was washed away, houses collapsed, and people and animals were harmed. The few acres of thin land became thinner and thinner, and this place became poorer and poorer. Except for a few landlords and rich peasants who spent lavishly, eating and drinking without worry, 70 to 80 percent of the poor people ate bran and wild vegetables, and their lives were difficult to maintain, and they had to separate from their wives and children and flee elsewhere. After liberation, especially since the communization, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, relying on the powerful force of the collective economy, and carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance, the people of Xigou have built the poor mountain gully, which lacked all five elements of "gold, wood, water, fire, and earth," into a new socialist countryside. The former dry riverbed has now been built into 300 mu of grain fields and 200 mu of apple orchards. More than 10,000 mu of barren mountains have been planted with pine and cypress trees, and thousands of mu of barren slopes have also been planted with pasture, basically achieving that the soil does not go down the mountain and the water does not leave the ditch. The mountains have changed, and the land has also changed. In 1964, the grain yield per mu reached 601 jin. Last year, we suffered from a once-in-a-century drought, and the grain yield per mu still reached 481 jin. There has also been great development in large livestock and sheep. The lives of the members have been significantly improved. The whole brigade has more than 1,400 people, eating and wearing well, and most members have savings and surplus grain at home. The lives of the masses have improved, and the contribution to the country is greater, which is very natural. Two societies, two different lives, we poor and lower-middle peasants are very clear in our hearts, and we will never allow Wu Han to talk nonsense.
    Chairman Mao told us: "It is a good thing, not a bad thing, to be opposed by the enemy." Wu Han spent a lot of effort to praise Hai Rui. However, in the eyes of the revolutionary people, Hai Rui can only be a representative figure of feudal forces and will never become the "savior" of the people. Wu Han's scolding of our Communist Party will only make the Party even greater in the eyes of the people. The members of our Xigou Brigade all expressed that they will resolutely read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, farm for the revolution, farm scientifically, and build our Xigou even better as quickly as possible. We will support national construction, support world revolution, defend the Party and socialism with practical actions, resolutely fight to the end against all class enemies at home and abroad, and fight to the end against Wu Han, who speaks for the right-leaning opportunists of the bourgeoisie.
