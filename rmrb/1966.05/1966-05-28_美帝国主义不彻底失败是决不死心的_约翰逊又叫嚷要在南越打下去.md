    According to Xinhua News Agency, Washington dispatch: U.S. President Johnson, driven to distraction by the situation in South Vietnam, reiterated on the 21st that the United States would persist in its war of aggression against Vietnam and would never give up until utterly defeated.
    Johnson acknowledged at an impromptu press conference at the White House that there was "unease and discontent" within the United States regarding the war of aggression against Vietnam. He said that the longer U.S. troops stayed in South Vietnam, the greater the losses would be. However, he emphasized that the United States would "do its utmost" to "maximize deterrence against Communist aggression." Addressing the demands of the American people and world public opinion for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Vietnam, he said, "Only after achieving the goal of stopping Communist ambitions," that is, after the United States had seized South Vietnam, would he be able to "stand at the forefront of those who demand withdrawal from Vietnam."
    Johnson once again played the "peace talks" trick. He said, "No nation desires peace in Vietnam as much as the United States, and no nation is willing to go as far for peace as the United States is willing to go." He pretended to be willing to "sit at the negotiating table with any other government for discussions." He indicated that, in order to promote the U.S. "peace talks" trick, the United States had conducted probes worldwide and was continuing to intensify its activities. When asked whether the U.S.'s "peace efforts" had stalled, he replied, "Absolutely not, absolutely not." In this regard, the United States has "daily activities."
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Washington dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Rusk, in a speech to a meeting of the American Foreign Policy Association on the 24th, reiterated the U.S. policy of persisting in the war of aggression against Vietnam to the end. He said that the United States would "continue to do what is necessary" to "defeat aggression." However long it takes, the United States will persist.
    Rusk attacked those within the United States who, worried about being bogged down too deeply and for too long in a place as remote as Vietnam disrupting the U.S.'s global strategic deployment, expressed dissatisfaction with the policy of aggression against Vietnam, calling them "holding onto obsolete concepts of a bygone era…believing that what happens next door is more important than what happens halfway around the world." He emphasized the importance of the western Pacific region, separated from the United States by vast oceans, and clamored that, in order to establish a "world order of peace that guarantees the security of the free system," the United States must "deter aggression" and "repel aggression." He also threatened, "I think it is generally understood that a thermonuclear aggression would not be a rational act, and an aggression involving large-scale conventional forces would entail very serious dangers."
    Rusk absurdly cited the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization treaty to justify the U.S.'s war of aggression against Vietnam, saying that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's ratification document gave the United States "the legal right to intervene in Vietnam," and he demanded that the member states of this organization, which had already fallen into disarray, "should be ready to take further steps to fulfill their treaty obligations."

### 美帝国主义不彻底失败是决不死心的  约翰逊又叫嚷要在南越打下去

    美帝国主义不彻底失败是决不死心的
    约翰逊又叫嚷要在南越打下去
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：被南越局势弄得焦头烂额的美国总统约翰逊，二十一日再次表示，美国坚持侵越战争，非到彻底失败，决不死心。
    约翰逊这一天在白宫举行的临时记者招待会上，承认美国国内对侵越战争存在“不安和不满情绪”。他说，美国军队在南越呆得越久，损失就会越大。但是，他强调美国要“尽最大的努力”“对共产党侵略进行最大的威慑”。他针对美国人民和世界公众主张美国军队撤出南越的要求说，“只有在实现了制止共产党野心的目标后”，也就是说，美国霸占了南越以后，他才能“站在那些要求撤出越南的人的前列”。
    约翰逊再次玩弄“和谈”骗局。他说什么“没有任何国家象美国那样希望在越南实现和平，也没有任何国家愿意为了和平而走到象美国愿意走到的这么远的地步。”他假惺惺地表示愿意“同其他任何政府坐在谈判桌旁进行讨论”。他表明，为了推销美国的“和谈”骗局，美国已在全世界范围内进行了试探，并且正在继续加紧活动。当有人问他美国的“和平努力”是否停滞下来了，他回答说，“绝对不是，绝对不是。”在这方面，美国“每天都有活动”。
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿腊斯克二十四日在美国外交学会一次会议上发表演说时，重申了美国坚持侵越战争到底的政策。他说，美国将“继续做必要的事情”来“击败侵略”。需要多久，美国就要坚持多久。
    腊斯克攻击美国国内那些担心在越南这样一个遥远的地方陷得太深、太久会打乱美国全球战略部署，因而对侵越政策表示不满的人，是“抱着过去时代的陈腐概念……认为发生在隔壁的事情比发生在半个世界之外的事情更重要”。他强调同美国重洋相隔的太平洋西岸地区对美国的重要性，并且叫嚷说，美国为了建立一个“保证自由体制安全的和平的世界秩序”，必须“阻遏侵略”和“击退侵略”。他还恫吓说，“我认为人们已普遍了解，一场热核侵略不会是一个理性的行动，而投入大规模常规部队的侵略将会招致非常严重的危险”。
    腊斯克荒唐地援引东南亚集团条约来为美国进行侵越战争辩护，说什么东南亚条约组织的批准书给了美国“干涉越南的法律权力”，他要求已陷于四分五裂的这个集团的成员国“应当随时准备采取进一步的步骤来履行它们的条约义务。”（附图片）
