    Xinhua News Agency, 19th.  Returned Overseas Chinese from all walks of life in the capital gathered today, resolutely supporting the Chinese Foreign Ministry's note to the Indonesian Embassy in China on May 18 and the statement of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, strongly condemning the Indonesian government's fascist crimes of frantically opposing China and persecuting Chinese.
      The returned Overseas Chinese unanimously demanded that the Indonesian government promptly provide a satisfactory reply to the Chinese Foreign Ministry's note, immediately cease the atrocities of persecuting Overseas Chinese, and not obstruct China's dispatch of ships to transport victimized Overseas Chinese who voluntarily wish to return to their country. They solemnly warned the Indonesian government: The great Chinese people are not to be trifled with. If the Indonesian government disregards the righteous condemnation of the Chinese people and the people of the world, continues to trample on the norms of international relations, and continues to oppose China and persecute Chinese, it will inevitably suffer the consequences of its own actions.
    At the rally jointly convened by the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and the Beijing Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, many victimized Overseas Chinese who recently returned from Indonesia and the families of victimized Overseas Chinese, using their own and their relatives' experiences of suffering, angrily denounced the towering crimes of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in beating, robbing, kidnapping, and slaughtering innocent Overseas Chinese.  Returning Overseas Chinese Rao Yexu, holding up a blood-stained shirt at the meeting, denounced: This is the ironclad proof of the Indonesian reactionaries' persecution of Overseas Chinese, and they cannot deny it. On March 4, this Overseas Chinese was hit on the head with stones and clubs by right-wing thugs in Jakarta.  Rao Yexu said: The Indonesian reactionaries' bloody atrocities cannot escape the punishment of the people; blood debts must be repaid with blood.  Overseas Chinese teacher Gan Jiasong, who taught at an Overseas Chinese school in Indonesia for 25 years, denounced with the facts he witnessed that the majority of the property of Overseas Chinese in the Lampung region of Indonesia was robbed, many Overseas Chinese schools were forcibly occupied and destroyed, and many Overseas Chinese teachers and students were forced to become unemployed and out of school.  One night, five armed soldiers broke into his house, conducted an illegal search, and threatened that he had a transceiver and was not allowed to listen to Beijing Radio. Gan Jiasong sternly retorted: I only have a radio, and it is my right to listen to broadcasts from my motherland. He said at the meeting that the Indonesian handful of right-wing reactionary forces created various despicable excuses for opposing China and persecuting Chinese, which was a deception of the Indonesian people and the people of the world. Their sinister aim of serving imperialism can in no way be concealed.
    Yu Xiuyun and Lin Bichun, family members of victimized Overseas Chinese, indignantly recounted the tragic scenes of their relatives still in Indonesia being persecuted. Yu Xiuyun said that her family's property had been robbed, and life was becoming more difficult every day. The house of one of my classmates was burned down, the property was robbed, and more than ten members of the family were left homeless. Later, they were unreasonably detained by the right-wing authorities and lived an inhuman life.  Lin Bichun denounced that the right-wing thugs were like robbers, taking away everything they could take, and destroying everything they could not take. Now there is white terror everywhere in Indonesia. Many Overseas Chinese have been separated from their wives and children, many Overseas Chinese have been killed by thugs, and many Overseas Chinese women have been abducted, and their whereabouts are still unknown. They said that these crimes committed by the Indonesian fascist bandits cannot be denied in any way. We have a powerful socialist motherland as our backing, and with the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, our Overseas Chinese are inviolable. We firmly support our government's decision to send ships to transport the victimized Overseas Chinese.
    The persons in charge of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and the Beijing Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese attended today's rally.  Zhuang Xiquan, Acting Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, on behalf of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, resolutely supported the solemn position of the Chinese government expressed in the notes and statements of the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia. He condemned: The crimes of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in persecuting Overseas Chinese were entirely carried out under the meticulous planning and direct organization of the Indonesian government. The ironclad evidence is like a mountain and cannot be denied. The Indonesian government insists on calling the atrocities of persecuting Overseas Chinese as the "reaction of the angry people," which is pushing the crime onto the Indonesian people. It is a monstrous lie, extremely shameless! Can blood debts be erased? No, absolutely not! Overseas Chinese see it very clearly, and the Indonesian people and the people of the world see it very clearly. The Indonesian government must bear full responsibility for its crimes.
    Chen Qiyuan, Huang Changshui, Zhuang Mingli, Wang Yuanxing, You Yangzu, Wu Yixiu, and other members of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and the Beijing Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese emphasized at the meeting that the Indonesian right-wing reactionary group's rampant opposition to China and persecution of Chinese cannot harm a single hair of the great People's Republic of China, and can only expose their ugly faces as running dogs for US imperialism's anti-China activities. They warned the Indonesian government: The Chinese government and the Chinese people will never sit idly by in the face of your cruel persecution of Overseas Chinese. Your anti-China and anti-Chinese activities are completely unpopular. The Indonesian people and the people of the world will definitely rise up to settle accounts with you for your heinous crimes and the blood debts you owe! Your days and the days of your master, US imperialism, will not be long.
    Overseas Chinese workers, teachers, and students who returned from Indonesia pointed out in their speeches that the anti-China and anti-Chinese movement launched by the Indonesian right wing was a criminal measure for them to cater to the needs of US imperialism and to carry out anti-communist and anti-people activities at home. It is only a handful of reactionaries who are enemies of the Indonesian people who are anti-China and anti-Chinese. The broad masses of the Indonesian people want to maintain friendship with the Chinese people.  Returning Overseas Chinese worker Liu Yunsheng said: The profound friendship between the Indonesian people and the Chinese people forged in the long-term struggle against imperialism and new and old colonialism can never be destroyed by any reactionary force. Since the Indonesian right-wing forces are enemies of the Indonesian people, they will inevitably slander China, oppose China, and persecute Chinese. Indonesian reactionaries, listen: All the anti-China "heroes" in the world have never had a good ending. Since you are acting as running dogs in the anti-China chorus, you will definitely be no exception. Returning Overseas Chinese student Lin Minqing said: The revolutionary Indonesian people know who their friends are and who their enemies are. It is a dream for the Indonesian right wing to try to destroy the friendship between the two peoples!  Zhang Guoji, principal of the Beijing Overseas Chinese Supplementary School, and Wu Shihuang, associate professor of Peking University, who returned from Indonesia, also pointed out in their speeches that the Overseas Chinese in Indonesia have worked and lived with the local people for generations and have made indelible contributions to the development of Indonesia's national economy and cultural undertakings, and have been universally praised by the Indonesian people. Any slander of Overseas Chinese by the Indonesian right wing is futile.
    Returned Overseas Chinese from other countries, such as Zhang Chukun, Xu Simin, Wei Zhengming, and Lin Yi, also spoke at the meeting, unanimously supporting our government's dispatch of ships to transport the Overseas Chinese in distress, and expressed warm solidarity and deep sympathy to the victimized Indonesian Overseas Chinese.
    Recently returned Overseas Chinese Wang Qisheng, Wu Pengde, Li Huanquan, Chen Guoyuan, and Li Yumin reported at the meeting on their heroic struggles against the Indonesian reactionaries. They said that when they were engaged in a tit-for-tat struggle with the right-wing thugs who came to attack them, they thought of the great motherland, the great people of the motherland, and Chairman Mao's teachings, and their bodies were filled with infinite fighting power. They defended the dignity and honor of the motherland in the face of reactionary violence, demonstrating the great heroic spirit of the Chinese people. Their deeds of struggle were warmly praised by the people who attended the meeting. (Attached picture)

    首都归国华侨集会声讨印尼政府疯狂反华排华罪行
    有毛主席领导，我们华侨是不可侮辱的！
    印尼反动派充当美帝反华走卒，他们欠下的血债一定要偿还
    新华社十九日讯　首都各界归国华侨今天集会，坚决拥护我国外交部五月十八日给印度尼西亚驻中国大使馆的照会和华侨事务委员会的声明，强烈谴责印度尼西亚政府疯狂反华排华的法西斯罪行。
      归国华侨一致要求印度尼西亚政府迅速对我国外交部的照会作出圆满的答复，立即停止迫害华侨的暴行，对我国派船接运自愿回国的受害华侨不得进行阻挠。他们严正警告印度尼西亚政府：伟大的中国人民不是好惹的，如果印度尼西亚政府不顾中国人民和全世界人民的正义谴责，继续践踏国际关系准则，继续反华排华，必将自食恶果。
    在全国侨联和北京市侨联联合召开的集会上，许多最近从印度尼西亚回国的受害华侨和受害华侨的家属，用他们和他们的亲人受害的经过，愤怒地控诉印度尼西亚右派反动势力殴打、抢劫、绑架、屠杀无辜华侨的滔天罪行。归侨饶业绪在会上举着血衣控诉说：这就是印度尼西亚反动派残害华侨的铁证，它们是抵赖不掉的。三月四日，这位华侨在雅加达被右派暴徒用石块、棍棒打破了头。饶业绪说：印度尼西亚反动派的血腥暴行是逃脱不了人民的惩罚的，血债一定要用血来偿还。在印度尼西亚华侨学校任教二十五年的华侨教师甘甲松用他亲眼所见的事实控诉说，印度尼西亚楠榜地区华侨的绝大部分财产被抢劫，许多华侨学校被强占和破坏，许多华侨教师和学生被迫失业、失学。一天深夜，五个武装军人闯进他的家里，进行非法搜查，威胁说什么他藏有收发报机，不准他收听北京广播，甘甲松严词驳斥道：我只有收音机，我收听祖国的广播是我的权利。他在会上说，印度尼西亚一小撮右派反动势力制造反华排华的各种卑鄙借口，是对印度尼西亚人民和全世界人民的欺骗。它们为帝国主义效劳的罪恶目的是无论如何也掩盖不了的。
    受害华侨的家属俞秀云、林碧春激愤地述说了她们还在印度尼西亚的亲人遭受迫害的惨景。俞秀云说，我家的财物已被抢劫一空，生活一天比一天困难。我的一位同学的家，房屋被烧毁，财物被抢光，一家十多口人流落街头，以后又被右派当局无理扣押，过着非人的生活。林碧春控诉说，右派暴徒就象强盗一样，抢走了凡是他们能拿走的东西，拿不走的就全部捣毁。现在印度尼西亚到处都是白色恐怖。许多华侨被搞得妻离子散，许多华侨被暴徒杀死，不少华侨妇女被抢走，至今生死不明。她们说，印度尼西亚法西斯匪徒犯下的这些罪行，是怎么也抵赖不了的。我们有强大的社会主义祖国作靠山，有伟大领袖毛主席的领导，我们华侨是不可侮辱的，我们坚决支持我国政府派船接运受害华侨的决定。
    全国侨联和北京市侨联的负责人参加了今天的集会。全国侨联代理主席庄希泉在会上代表全国侨联，坚决拥护我国外交部、华侨事务委员会在照会和声明中表达的我国政府维护印度尼西亚华侨正当权利和利益的严正立场。他谴责说：印度尼西亚右派反动势力迫害华侨的罪行，完全是在印度尼西亚政府精心策划和直接组织之下干出来的，铁证如山，抵赖不了。印度尼西亚政府硬把迫害华侨的暴行说成是什么“愤怒的人民大众的反应”，这是把罪行硬推在印度尼西亚人民的身上，真是弥天大谎，无耻至极！血债能抹得掉么？不能，绝不能！华侨看得很清楚，印度尼西亚人民和全世界人民都看得很清楚，印度尼西亚政府必须对它们的罪行负完全责任。
    全国侨联委员和北京市侨联委员陈其瑗、黄长水、庄明理、王源兴、尤扬祖、吴益修等在会上都强调指出，印度尼西亚右派反动集团猖狂反华排华，损害不了伟大的中华人民共和国的一根毫毛，只能暴露它们俯首贴耳充当美帝国主义反华走卒的丑恶面目。他们警告印度尼西亚政府说：中国政府和中国人民对你们残酷迫害华侨，决不会置之不顾。你们的反华排华完全不得人心。你们的滔天罪行，你们欠下的血债，印度尼西亚人民和全世界人民一定要起来同你们清算的！你们和你们的主子美帝国主义的日子是不会长久的。
    从印度尼西亚归国的华侨职工、教师、学生在发言中都指出，印度尼西亚右派掀起的反华排华运动，是它们迎合美帝国主义需要和在国内进行反共、反人民的一个罪恶措施。反华和排华的只是一小撮与印度尼西亚人民为敌的反动派，广大的印度尼西亚人民是要和中国人民友好下去的。归侨职工刘云生说：印度尼西亚人民同中国人民在长期反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争中结成的深厚友谊，是任何反动势力永远破坏不了的。印度尼西亚右派势力既然同印度尼西亚人民为敌，就必然要诬蔑中国，反华排华。印度尼西亚反动派听着：世界上所有的反华“英雄”从来没有好下场，你们既然充当反华大合唱中的走卒，也绝不会例外。归侨学生林民庆说：革命的印度尼西亚人民懂得谁是他们的朋友，谁是他们的敌人。印度尼西亚右派要想破坏两国人民的友谊，是梦想！印度尼西亚归侨、北京华侨补习学校校长张国基和北京大学副教授吴世璜在发言中还指出，印度尼西亚的华侨世世代代和当地人民同劳动，共生活，对发展印度尼西亚的民族经济和文化事业作出了不可磨灭的贡献，受到印度尼西亚人民的普遍赞誉。印度尼西亚右派对华侨的任何诬蔑，都是徒劳的。
    在会上发言的还有其他国家的归国华侨张楚琨、徐四民、魏正明、林艺等，他们一致拥护我国政府派船接运受难华侨，并对受害的印度尼西亚华侨表示热烈的声援和深切的慰问。
    最近回国的华侨王启生、吴朋德、李焕权、陈国源、李育民等，在会上报告了同印度尼西亚反动派进行英勇斗争的事迹。他们谈到，当他们同前来袭击的右派暴徒们进行针锋相对斗争的时候，想起了伟大的祖国，想起了伟大的祖国人民，想起了毛主席的教导，身上充满着无限的斗争力量。他们在反动派暴力面前维护住了祖国的尊严和荣誉，表现了中国人民的伟大的英雄气概。他们的斗争事迹，受到参加集会的人们的热烈赞扬。（附图片）
