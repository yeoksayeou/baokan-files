    Deng Tuo viciously attacked our Party for "relying on power and acting arbitrarily." Our Party does indeed "rely" on "power" and "act" "arbitrarily," but our Party relies on the power of the working class and the poor and lower-middle peasants, the power of 650 million revolutionary people, and the strength of the proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system. Relying on such "power" and acting with such "strength" is only detrimental to monsters and demons like the "Three-Family Village," but it is greatly beneficial to the revolutionary people. In the past, we had to rely on such power and act with such strength, and in the future, we will continue to rely on such power and act with such strength. Otherwise, class enemies will once again ride on our heads.
              Hunan Hengdong County Xinlong Brigade Commune Member  Shan Yunqi
    Deng Tuo thinks he is very "knowledgeable" and wrote a thick book, "Yanshan Night Talks," attempting to set up a magic trap in front of the revolutionary people. Now the magic trap has been broken, and the trap-setter has been captured. It can be seen that people like Deng Tuo are nothing more than paper tigers, strong in appearance but weak in reality. The truly knowledgeable people are the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. No matter when or where, as soon as the paper tiger twitches its butt, the revolutionary people know what kind of shit it is going to pull; as soon as the paper tiger opens its mouth, the revolutionary people know what it is planning!

      "Ten years to sharpen a sword, the blade never tested, today I present it to you, who has grievances?" This is a nakedly anti-Party poem that Deng Tuo raised through the mouth of Jia Dao, calling on people with "grievances" to rise up in rebellion. Under today's socialist system, "who has grievances"? Only landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists have "grievances." We exercise dictatorship over them, only allowing them to behave themselves and not allowing them to speak or act recklessly. Naturally, only they will feel "aggrieved." Deng Tuo is shouting loudly to these monsters and demons with "grievances," calling on them to rise up against the Party and socialism. But how can these ants shake the towering tree of socialism?
                        A certain unit of the Beijing Military Region  Gao He
    Deng Tuo wants us to "everywhere regard ourselves as masters and blaze a trail ourselves." What kind of "road" is this? In the final analysis, it is a road to restore capitalism, because there are only two roads in front of us: one is the bright socialist road pointed out to us by the Party, and the other is the dark capitalist road. We have been victoriously walking the socialist road for many years. Deng Tuo and a handful of others feel that this road is not good, causing them to "bash their heads and bleed." Therefore, he advocates taking the capitalist road. More than 95 percent of the revolutionary people will never follow Deng Tuo on this dead end, and only a very few people with granite heads will wholeheartedly take this road to destruction.

    In the old society, the Naxi people had the sky above their heads, and the sky was dark. What our Naxi peasants in Huangshan Commune were burdened with was the landlords. The life of the poor and lower-middle peasants was "wearing straw sandals on their feet, sheepskins on their bodies, sleeping on messy grass, and covered with coir raincoats." Now, with the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, even living in the mountains, the sky is bright. In the past, we lit pine torches at night, but now every family in the commune has electric lights. Deng Tuo and his gang are pointing at the winter melon while cursing the gourd, wanting our Party to "rest." We say that the Party and Chairman Mao are our red sun, and the Naxi people cannot live without them for a single day.

    邓拓恶毒地攻击我们党“依靠权势，蛮横逞强”。我们党的确是“依”了“势”，“逞”了“强”，不过我们党依的是工人阶级和贫下中农之势，六亿五千万革命人民之势，逞的是无产阶级专政之强，社会主义制度之强。依这样的“势”，逞这样的“强”，只是对“三家村”之类的牛鬼蛇神不利，对革命的人民则是大大的有利。过去我们要依这样的势，逞这样的强，今后我们还要依这样的势，逞这样的强。否则，阶级敌人又会骑到我们头上来了。

    邓拓自以为很有“学问”，写了厚厚的一本《燕山夜话》，企图在革命的人民面前布一个迷魂阵。现在是迷魂阵被破，布阵者被擒了。可见邓拓之流也不过是一只外强中干的纸老虎，真正有学问的是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民。不管是在什么时候，在什么地方，纸老虎一撅屁股，革命人民就知道它要拉什么屎；纸老虎一张嘴巴，革命的人民就知道它安的什么心！

      “十年磨一剑，霜刃未曾试，今日把示君，谁有不平事？”这是邓拓借贾岛之口提出来的一首赤裸裸的反诗，号召有“不平事”的人们起来造反。在今天的社会主义制度下“谁有不平事”呢？只有地富反坏右才有“不平事”，我们专了他们的政，只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动，自然只有他们才会感到“不平”。邓拓正是向这些“有不平事”的牛鬼蛇神们高声疾呼，号召他们起来反党反社会主义。但是这些蚍蜉似的一小撮人，怎么撼得动社会主义的参天大树呢？

    邓拓要我们“处处以主人翁自居，自己踏出一条路来。”这条“路”是条怎样的路呢？说到底，就是一条复辟资本主义的路，因为我们面前摆着的只有两条路，一条是党给我们指出的光明的社会主义大路，一条是黑暗的资本主义邪路。社会主义道路我们已经胜利地走了多年了，邓拓等一小撮人觉得这条路不好，害得他们“碰得头破血流”，所以他主张走资本主义道路。百分之九十五以上的革命人民，是绝不会跟邓拓走这条死路的，只有极少数长着花冈岩脑袋的人才会死心踏地去走这条灭亡之路。

    在旧社会，纳西族头上有天，天是黑漆漆的，我们黄山公社纳西族农民，头上压着的是地主。贫下中农的生活是“脚上穿草鞋，身上披羊皮，铺的是乱草，盖的是棕衣。”现在有共产党和毛主席的领导，住在山沟里天也是亮堂堂的，过去夜晚点松毛明子，如今社员家家都装上了电灯。邓拓等一伙人指东瓜，骂葫芦，要我们党“休息”，我们说，党和毛主席是我们的红太阳，纳西族人民一天也离不开他。
