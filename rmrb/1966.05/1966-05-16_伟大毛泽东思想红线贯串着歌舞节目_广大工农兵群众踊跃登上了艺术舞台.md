    The Seventh "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival Opens in a New Situation of the Socialist Cultural Revolution
    Great Mao Zedong Thought Red Line Runs Through Song and Dance Programs
    Broad Masses of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Actively Ascend the Artistic Stage
    Worker, peasant, and soldier masses and professional music and dance workers regard participation in this music festival as a combat action to plunge into the Socialist Cultural Revolution, and regard each program as a bullet to fire at the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th - The Seventh "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival, held in the new situation of the Socialist Cultural Revolution, opened on the evening of the 14th at the Shanghai Cultural Square.
      This music festival is a review of the great achievements and demonstration of great strength made by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Shanghai in the Socialist Cultural Revolution over the past year. It is also a review of the results achieved by Shanghai's professional music and dance workers in highlighting politics, creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, implementing Mao Zedong's literary and artistic direction, and going deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    The opening performance on the evening of the 14th opened with the magnificent orchestral piece "Ode to the Red Flag." This piece expresses how, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of our country hold high the red flag of anti-imperialism, anti-revisionism, and support for world revolution, advancing courageously with giant strides. Pingtan artists performed Chairman Mao's poems "Farewell to the God of Plague" (two poems) that evening. Forty students from ten ethnic groups in the national class of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, wearing brightly colored ethnic costumes, performed the singing performance "All Ethnic Groups' Hearts Face the Party," singing and dancing to express their sincere love for the Party and Chairman Mao.
    A significant feature of this music festival is that more worker, peasant, and soldier masses have ascended the artistic stage of music and dance. In the comprehensive performance and amateur music and dance special performance held simultaneously on the evening of the 14th, more than 1,000 workers, peasants, soldiers, young students, and children performed on stage. The majority of the programs in these two performances were created by the worker, peasant, and soldier masses themselves. They sang about themselves and performed about themselves, with sincere emotions and full enthusiasm, receiving enthusiastic praise from more than 10,000 people in the audience.
    Six workers from the Shanghai Solvent Factory performed the male voice singing performance "Elderly Workers Studying Chairman Mao's Works" on the evening of the 14th. This program was written by the factory's workers based on the deeds of Ma Zhongyun, a Five-Good worker and national advanced producer in the factory, who has persisted in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works for ten years. With deep proletarian feelings, the song expresses the elderly workers' respect and love for Chairman Mao; it portrays the deeds of the old worker cultivating red successors with class feelings by creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Seven female commune members from the Hongqiao Commune in Shanghai County sang the female voice singing performance "Planting Vegetables Thinking of Those Who Eat Vegetables" with a lively and moving melody, accompanied by labor-filled performance movements such as hoeing, sowing, planting vegetables, pest control, and pulling carts, expressing the moving scenes of suburban vegetable farmers carrying out a revolution in the vegetable fields in order to ensure the supply of socialist cities. Eight Five-Good fighters from the Air Force unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army sang the revolutionary song "Ode to the Eagle" with simplicity and power. This song reflects the revolutionary spirit of our air force growing stronger under the nurture of Mao Zedong Thought, fighting heroically to defend the airspace of the motherland. The chorus "We Are Revolutionary Youths" created and performed by Shanghai No. 8 Girls' Middle School, and the singing performance "Growing Up to Be a Peasant" by the affiliated elementary school of Shanghai No. 1 Normal School, vividly reflect the healthy growth and vigorous spirit of the younger generation in our country under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought.
    Many programs in this music festival are permeated with the red line of great Mao Zedong Thought, and have made new developments in striving to reflect our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and to shape the heroic images of the socialist era, especially the heroic images of the working class. Many works and performances have broken through foreign frameworks and old frameworks, starting from life, starting from shaping heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers, with diverse and lively forms, and striving to be popular with workers, peasants, and soldiers. "Forward, Glorious Shanghai Workers," performed by more than 200 professional music and dance workers, is a performance grand chorus divided into eight sections. This large-scale work describes the heroic deeds of Shanghai workers using Mao Zedong Thought as a guiding light, using their own hands to build Shanghai into an advanced industrial and scientific and technological base, and enthusiastically praises the thorough proletarian revolutionary spirit of Shanghai workers adhering to self-reliance, striving for progress, and overcoming all difficulties to seize victory. In the process of creation, the creators of this performance grand chorus actively studied Chairman Mao's works and relevant documents, and visited Daqing-style factories and enterprises in Shanghai, arousing strong creative enthusiasm. They were determined to bring the glorious image of the working class to the stage. In this performance grand chorus, various forms of expression such as chorus, unison singing, round singing, antiphonal singing, solo singing, and duet singing are used, and accompanied by recitation and dance, to express revolutionary feelings. The entire music has a strong fighting atmosphere and a distinct sense of the times.
    Another chorus with a unique performance style, "Answering the World Today - Reading Wang Jie's Diary," was created by teachers and students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music in the upsurge of "Singing Wang Jie, Learning from Wang Jie, and Being Wang Jie." This chorus combines the techniques of Peking Opera music with revolutionary songs, boldly expressing the lofty aspirations of our people facing the world today, like the great warrior Wang Jie, determined to carry the revolution through to the end. When more than 90 teachers and students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music performed this program with full revolutionary passion, they won warm applause from the audience. Many people believe that this work is a gratifying attempt in the nationalization of chorus music.
    Many worker, peasant, and soldier masses and professional music and dance workers in Shanghai regard participating in this "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival as a combat action to devote themselves to the Cultural Revolution. In the process of creation and rehearsal, they insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works, and generally studied the two editorials "Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Actively Participate in the Socialist Cultural Revolution" and "Never Forget Class Struggle" recently published by the *Liberation Army Daily*, and articles such as "Comments on 'Three-Family Village'". Through study, they improved their political awareness and further understood that art must serve proletarian politics and serve class struggle. They said: "Every one of our programs is a bullet to fire at the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line!" Many opera actors are also carrying the combat enthusiasm of resolutely destroying the anti-Party black line and will sing revolutionary songs at this music festival.
    This music festival will feature ten special performances, each with a clear theme. These include Chairman Mao's poems recital, praise of heroes, learning from Daqing and Dazhai, Long Live the Victory of People's War, revolutionary modern opera recital, etc. In addition, there are special performances for amateur music and dance, children's music and dance, mass singing rallies, and music detachments. Among the nearly 200 programs in these ten special performances, 130 are new works by worker, peasant, and soldier masses and Shanghai music and dance workers; some are excellent programs that were performed at the previous "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival and have been welcomed by the broad masses and further processed. In addition, some excellent programs from other places have also been absorbed.
    Responsible comrades of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, and the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee watched the wonderful performance on the evening of the 14th.

    第七届“上海之春”音乐会在社会主义文化大革命新形势下揭幕
    伟大毛泽东思想红线贯串着歌舞节目
    广大工农兵群众踊跃登上了艺术舞台
    工农兵群众和专业音乐舞蹈工作者，把参加这次音乐会，作为投身社会主义文化大革命的一次战斗行动，把每一个节目当作向反党反社会主义黑线开火的子弹
    新华社上海十五日电　在社会主义文化大革命新形势下举行的第七届“上海之春”音乐会，十四日晚上在上海文化广场揭幕。
      这届音乐会是一年来上海广大工农兵群众在社会主义文化大革命中取得的巨大成就和显示巨大力量的一次检阅，也是上海专业音乐舞蹈工作者突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，贯彻毛泽东文艺方向，深入工农兵以后所取得的成果的一次检阅。
    十四日晚上的开幕演出，是以气势磅礴的管弦乐《红旗颂》为开幕曲的。这部乐曲表现了在毛泽东思想指导下的我国人民高举反帝、反修和支持世界革命的红旗，以巨人般的步伐奋勇前进。评弹艺人当晚演出了毛主席的诗七律《送瘟神》两首。上海音乐学院民族班十个民族的四十名学生，穿着色彩鲜艳的民族服装，表演了《各族人民心向党》的表演唱，边歌边舞地表达了对党和毛主席的衷心爱戴。
    有更多的工农兵群众登上音乐舞蹈的艺术舞台，是这届音乐会的一个重要特点。在十四日晚上同时举行的综合场和业余音乐舞蹈专场演出中，就有工人、农民、解放军战士、青年学生、少年儿童一千多人登台表演。这两场表演的节目大部分是工农兵群众自己创作的作品。他们唱自己、演自己，感情真挚，情绪饱满，受到全场一万多人的热烈赞扬。
    上海溶剂厂六个职工十四日晚上演出了男声表演唱《老年工人学习毛主席著作》，这个节目是这个厂职工根据本厂五好工人、全国先进生产者马仲云十年来坚持活学活用毛主席著作的事迹编写的。歌曲以深厚的无产阶级感情，表达了老年工人对毛主席的尊敬和热爱；刻划了老工人带着阶级感情活学活用毛主席著作培养红色接班人的事迹。上海县虹桥公社的七个女社员以明快动人的曲调，演唱了体现工农联盟的女声表演唱《种菜想着吃菜人》，一边唱一边伴着锄地、播种、种菜、治虫、拉车等充满劳动气息的表演动作，表现了郊区菜农为了保证社会主义城市的供应，在菜田里大闹革命的动人情景。中国人民解放军空军部队八个五好战士质朴有力地演唱了革命歌曲《雄鹰之歌》，这首歌曲反映了我国空军在毛泽东思想哺育下日益壮大，为保卫祖国领空英勇作战的革命精神。上海市第八女子中学自己创作和演出的齐唱《我们是革命青年》，上海第一师范学校附属小学的表演唱《长大做个庄稼汉》等节目，生动地反映了我国年轻一代在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下健康成长，天天向上，朝气勃勃的精神面貌。
    这届音乐会的许多节目，都贯串着伟大的毛泽东思想的红线，在努力反映我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设，塑造社会主义时代的英雄形象，特别是塑造工人阶级的英雄形象方面，有了新的发展。许多作品和表演都突破了洋框框，旧框框，从生活出发，从塑造工农兵英雄人物出发，形式多种多样，生动活泼，而且力求为工农兵所喜闻乐见。由二百多名专业音乐舞蹈工作者演出的《前进，光荣的上海工人》，是一部分为八段的表演大合唱。这部大型作品，描写了上海工人以毛泽东思想为指路明灯，用自己的双手把上海建成为一个先进的工业和科学技术的基地的英雄事迹，热烈地歌颂了上海工人坚持自力更生，奋发图强，排除万难，去夺取胜利的无产阶级彻底革命的精神。这部表演大合唱的创作人员在创作过程中，积极学习毛主席著作和有关文件，并且深入到上海的大庆式工厂企业参观、访问，激起了强烈的创作激情，他们立志把工人阶级的光辉形象搬上舞台。在这部表演大合唱中，运用了合唱、齐唱、轮唱、对唱、独唱、二重唱等多种表现形式，并且配合朗诵和舞蹈，来抒发革命之情，整个音乐有强烈的战斗气息，具有鲜明的时代感。
    另一部具有独特表演风格的合唱《回答今日的世界——读王杰日记》，是上海音乐学院师生在“唱王杰、学王杰、做王杰”的热潮中创作的。这部合唱运用了京剧音乐的手法与革命歌曲结合起来，豪迈地表现出我国人民面对今日的世界，象伟大的战士王杰一样，决心把革命进行到底的豪情壮志。当上海音乐学院九十多个师生满怀革命激情地演完这个节目的时候，博得了全场听众的热烈的掌声。很多人认为，这部作品是合唱音乐在民族化道路上的一个可喜尝试。
    上海许多工农兵群众和专业音乐舞蹈工作者，都把参加这届“上海之春”音乐会的演出，作为自己投身于文化大革命的一次战斗行动。他们在创作和排练过程中，坚持学习毛主席著作，并且普遍学习了《解放军报》最近发表的《高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极参加社会主义文化大革命》、《千万不要忘记阶级斗争》两篇社论和《评“三家村”》等文章，通过学习，提高了政治觉悟，进一步懂得了艺术必须为无产阶级政治服务，为阶级斗争服务的道理，他们说：“我们的每一个节目，都是向反党反社会主义黑线开火的子弹！”许多戏曲演员也带着坚决捣毁反党黑线的战斗热情，将在这次音乐会上大唱革命歌曲。
    这届音乐会共将演出十个专场，每个专场都有鲜明主题。其中包括有毛主席诗词演唱，英雄赞歌，学大庆学大寨，人民战争胜利万岁，革命现代戏曲演唱等。另外，还有业余音乐舞蹈，儿童音乐舞蹈，群众歌咏大会以及音乐小分队等专场。在这十个专场演出的近两百个节目中，有一百三十个节目是工农兵群众和上海音乐舞蹈工作者的新作；一部分是上届“上海之春”音乐会中演出的受到广大群众欢迎并经过进一步加工的优秀节目。此外，还吸收了外地的部分优秀节目。
    中共中央华东局、中共上海市委和上海市人民委员会的负责同志观看了十四日晚上的精彩演出。
