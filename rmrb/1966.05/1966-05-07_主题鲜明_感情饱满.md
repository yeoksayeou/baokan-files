    Several comrades from our area were very excited after seeing the ballet "The White-Haired Girl," considering it another new development and creation in ballet art following "The Red Detachment of Women," and a new achievement of our ballet artists in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. I think the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" has these notable characteristics:

    First, the theme is more prominent and emphasized. The teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School, based on the opera "The White-Haired Girl," have made new treatments and re-creations of the original work. If the theme of the opera "The White-Haired Girl" is "The old society turned people into ghosts, and the new society turns ghosts back into people," which is already very educational, then the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" has taken a step further, expressing the poor and lower-middle peasants' spirit of "class resistance, resistance to the end," their unyielding spirit of resistance. Some comrades said that this is the spirit of continuous revolution. This new treatment is more militant, more imbued with the spirit of the times, and more positively significant. Due to the changes of the times, this change is very good and sets a good example for us. The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" strengthens the rebellious character of the characters. For example, Yang Bailao is no longer a pitiful wretch to be slaughtered, but rises up to struggle and is beaten to death by the landlord. The whole play concentrates on the depiction of Xi'er's growth, such as the first act which summarizes many plots, and also gives full play to the characteristics of ballet, making it clean and clear. It is necessary to delete the plot of Xi'er's humiliation in the second act. In the fourth act, from the changes in time and Xi'er's hair, Xi'er's character also changes, and the spirit of resistance gradually increases. In addition, removing Wang Dachun's mother and concentrating on Zhang Ershen's scenes highlights Wang Dachun. Therefore, this play appears vibrant and full of fighting spirit. The prologue and epilogue are also very good, especially the ending, which illustrates that after the peasants have turned themselves over, they must still hold their weapons tightly, continue to be vigilant against class enemies, and carry the revolution through to the end.

    Second, ballet plus choral singing is a new creation and is very good. This is to "establish the new of socialism and establish the difference of the proletariat," and there should be this kind of courage. We must boldly break through; no destruction, no construction. Now with the choral singing, it can better help people understand the plot. For example, "I will not die, I want to live, I want revenge," this singing is more vivid and touching than without singing. The choral singing of this performance is also very good, singing with strength and emotion. The music is very attractive, and the tune of "The North Wind Blows" evokes people's emotions again and again.

    Third, the actors are very young, but their basic skills are still very good. The basic skills I'm referring to are not the tips of their toes or their turns, but the expression of the characters' spiritual outlook, performing our peasants, performing with emotion, and having the temperament of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    In short, I think the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" performed by the Shanghai Dance School is very successful. It not only provides valuable experience for China's ballet art, but also deserves to be learned by our opera workers and Peking opera workers. We must learn their revolutionary enthusiasm, learn their revolutionary spirit of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, learn their daring style, and learn their diligent and hard-working spirit, to contribute to the in-depth development of our cultural revolution.

    主题鲜明　感情饱满
    郑亦秋
    我们那里几位同志看了芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》后，都感到非常兴奋，认为这是继《红色娘子军》之后，芭蕾舞艺术的又一新的发展和创造，是我国芭蕾舞艺术工作者活学活用毛主席著作的新的成果。我觉得芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》有这样几个显著的特点：
    一、主题思想更加鲜明突出了。上海市舞蹈学校师生在歌剧《白毛女》的基础上，对原作做了新的处理和再创造。如果说，歌剧《白毛女》的主题是“旧社会把人逼成鬼，新社会使鬼变成人”，已经富有教育意义，那么，芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》则提高了一步，表现了贫下中农的“阶级反抗、反抗到底”的不屈不挠的反抗精神，有同志说，这就是不断革命精神。这种新的处理更有战斗性，更富有时代精神，更有积极意义。由于时代的变化，这种变化是非常好的，给我们树立了很好的榜样。芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》加强了人物的反抗性格。比如，杨白劳已不是任人宰割的可怜虫，而是起来斗争，被地主打死。全剧对喜儿的成长的描写，作了一些集中，如第一幕概括了很多情节，同时也发挥芭蕾舞的特点，显得干净明快。第二幕删弃喜儿受辱的情节是很必要的。第四幕从时间的变化，喜儿头发的变化，喜儿的性格也变化，反抗精神也逐渐增强了。此外，去掉王大春的母亲，集中了张二婶的戏，突出了王大春。所以这出戏显得朝气蓬勃、斗志昂扬。序幕和尾声也加得很好，特别是结尾，说明农民翻身之后，还要紧握住武器，继续警惕阶级敌人，将革命进行到底。
    二、芭蕾舞加伴唱，这是一种新的创造，非常好。这是“标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异”，应该有这种胆识。我们要大胆破，不破不立。现在有了伴唱，就更能帮助人们理解剧情，比如“我不死，我要活，我要报仇”，这一唱，比没有唱更鲜明，更感人。这次演出的伴唱也很好，唱得有力量，有感情。音乐很有吸引力，《北风吹》的曲调，一次又一次地唤起人们的感情。
    三、演员非常年青，但基本功还是很不错的。我说的这种基本功，不是指脚尖和转身方面，而是指表现人物的精神面貌，表演我们的农民，演得很有感情，有贫下中农的气质。
    总之，我觉得上海市舞蹈学校演出的芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》非常成功，不仅为我国的芭蕾舞艺术提供了宝贵的经验，而且也值得我们戏曲工作者、京剧工作者学习。我们要学习他们的革命干劲，学习他们活学活用毛主席著作的革命精神，学习他们敢闯的风格，学习他们勤学苦练的精神，为我们的文化革命深入开展贡献一份力量。
