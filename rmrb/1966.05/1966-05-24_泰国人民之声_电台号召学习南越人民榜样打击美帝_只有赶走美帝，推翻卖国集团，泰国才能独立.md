    New China News Agency, Bangkok, 20th dispatch: The "Voice of the People of Thailand" radio station, on the 17th, issued a commentary on the fourth anniversary of the massive increase in American aggressive troops entering Thailand, calling on the Thai people to unite and organize closely, and to wage a resolute struggle to drive out American imperialism and overthrow the Thanom-Praphas traitorous clique.

    On May 17, 1962, in order to expand its intervention in Laos, aggression against Vietnam, and suppression of national liberation movements in Southeast Asia, the United States increased the number of American invading troops stationed in Thailand from one thousand to five thousand. Now, the number of American invading troops has increased to more than twenty thousand.

    The radio commentary said that the nature of American imperialism's aggression and plunder will not change. If you don't drive away such an enemy, it will not leave. Only by waging a resolute struggle against it, driving it out of Thailand, and overthrowing the Thanom-Praphas clique that serves it, can Thailand's true independence, democracy, and the people's happy life be realized.

    The commentary said that expelling American imperialism, overthrowing the Thanom-Praphas clique, and striving for national independence and democracy have become the urgent demands of the entire Thai people. The six-point program of the Patriotic Front of Thailand reflects the interests of the Thai people. At present, a new wave of struggle to expel American imperialism and overthrow the Thanom-Praphas clique is taking shape in cities and villages across the country. In particular, the armed self-defense struggle of the rural people has developed and is able to crush the large-scale "encirclement and suppression" by thousands of military police of American imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas clique, supported by aircraft, artillery, and tanks.

    The commentary pointed out that for four years, American imperialism has continuously increased its troops in Thailand, controlled all important strategic strongholds in Thailand, and increasingly used Thailand as a military base for aggression against Indochina and Southeast Asia. American troops have also arbitrarily beaten, humiliated, and oppressed the Thai people, and raped Thai women. All these crimes of the American military cannot be questioned under Thai law.

    The commentary said that now, the Thai people have clearly realized that American imperialism and its lackeys, the Thanom-Praphas clique, are the irreconcilable and ferocious enemies of the Thai people, and the culprits who have brought various disasters to the Thai people.

    The commentary emphasized that American imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas clique are nothing but paper tigers. The real strength lies in the people who have awakened, organized, and are not afraid of hardship and sacrifice. The South Vietnamese people, who dare to fight and dare to win, have set a brilliant example for the Thai people. Fourteen million South Vietnamese people can defeat American imperialism and its running dogs and accomplices, and thirty million Thai people will certainly be able to defeat American imperialism and its running dogs, the Thanom-Praphas clique.

    “泰国人民之声”电台号召学习南越人民榜样打击美帝
    只有赶走美帝，推翻卖国集团，泰国才能独立
    新华社二十日讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台十七日就美国大量增派侵略军进入泰国四周年发表评论，号召泰国人民紧密团结和组织起来，为赶走美帝国主义，推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团而进行坚决的斗争。
    一九六二年五月十七日，美国为了扩大干涉老挝、侵略越南和镇压东南亚民族解放运动，把驻在泰国的美国侵略军从一千人增加到五千人。现在，美国侵略军已增加到两万多人。
    电台的评论说，美帝国主义的侵略和掠夺本性是不会改变的。对付这样的敌人，你不赶它，它就不走。只有同它进行坚决的斗争，把它赶出泰国，并推翻为它效劳的他侬—巴博集团，泰国的真正独立、民主和人民的幸福生活才能实现。
    评论说，驱逐美帝国主义，推翻他侬—巴博集团，争取民族独立和民主，已经成为全体泰国人民的迫切要求。泰国爱国阵线的六点纲领反映了泰国人民的利益。目前，在全国各城乡，一个驱逐美帝国主义、推翻他侬—巴博集团的新的斗争浪潮正在形成，特别是农村人民的武装自卫斗争已经发展起来，能够粉碎美帝国主义和他侬—巴博集团成千军警在飞机、大炮、坦克配合下的大规模“围剿”。
    评论指出，四年来，美帝国主义不断增兵泰国，控制了泰国所有重要的战略据点，越来越多地利用泰国作为侵略印度支那和东南亚的军事基地。美军还任意殴打、凌辱和欺压泰国人民，强奸泰国妇女。美军的所有这些罪行，泰国的法律都是不能过问的。
    评论说，现在，泰国人民已经清楚地认识到，美帝国主义和它的仆从他侬—巴博集团，是泰国人民的不共戴天的凶恶敌人，是给泰国人民带来各种灾难的罪魁祸首。
    评论强调，美帝国主义和他侬—巴博集团只不过是纸老虎，真正有力量的是已经觉悟并组织起来、不怕艰苦和不怕牺牲的人民。敢于斗争敢于胜利的越南南方人民已经给泰国人民树立了光辉的榜样。一千四百万南越人民能够战胜美帝国主义及其走狗和帮凶，三千万泰国人民也一定能够战胜美帝国主义和它的走狗他侬—巴博集团。
