    Pursue the matter and thoroughly destroy "Sanjiacun"!
    Guo Xing
    The article "‘Qianxian’—A Tool for Capitalist Restoration" provides very educational material. The heinous conspiracy of the "Sanjiacun" anti-Party clique has been further exposed before us.
    Our Party and our people have long seen that the anti-Party, anti-socialist conspiratorial activities of "Sanjiacun" are led, organized, and planned. A large number of facts revealed previously have conclusively proven this. Now, this very powerful material further proves this point.
    It turns out that Deng Tuo and his gang's intention to run a *Zajia Xunkan* (Miscellany Fortnightly) was long premeditated. In the article "Welcome 'Miscellanists'" in *Yanshan Yehu* (Yanshan Evening Talks) on March 26, 1961, Deng Tuo issued a "mobilization order" to their like-minded small group of reactionary figures; then, they carefully formulated the program for this *Zajia Xunkan*: "It must have politics, the whole thing must be permeated with a political perspective… it’s not just to give people some knowledge… every word must be a cannonball… it must exclusively publish things that other publications do not publish and do not have…" This means that the so-called "introducing some relevant situations and knowledge" is all a false front; propagating bourgeois "politics" that "other publications do not publish and do not have," and firing "cannonballs in every word" at the Party and socialism, is the real substance.
    However, such a *Zajia Xunkan* is difficult to launch in a country led by the proletariat. Hence, they "added the 'miscellanist' soul" to *Qianxian* (Front). Originally, they only wanted to "take out one-fifth of the space," but later it expanded to almost "one-half." Without stopping halfway, *Qianxian* thus became a tool for the anti-Party, anti-socialist "Sanjiacun." Why did this "Party journal" become a tool in the hands of "miscellanists"? This, of course, could not be finally decided by "Sanjiacun," nor could it be decided by Deng Tuo, the secretary in charge of culture and education. Obviously, this was another led, organized, and planned action.
    By June 1962, "Sanjiacun" felt the need to "stop and study" for a while. Why? Because they had reached a "fork in the road." What is a "fork in the road"? At this time, our country's temporary economic difficulties had not been completely overcome, but the situation was improving. U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries were also conducting military activities along the coast of Fujian. Amidst the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's clamor for "counterattacking the mainland," a small group of demons and monsters emerged one after another. The "brothers" of "Sanjiacun" were also "encouraged" by this; however, at this moment when class struggle was becoming increasingly acute, they could not help but "study": was it "a good time for propaganda" or "not a good time for propaganda"? Should they be pessimistic and passive (would they be met with a counterattack from the Party and the people), or should they be "actively optimistic"? Deng Tuo finally concluded: "Now is a good time for propaganda, not a bad time, not a time when there is no way out, we should be actively optimistic."
    Please note: after the "stop and study" in June, "Sanjiacun," in the month and a half from the end of June to the beginning of August, used the "cluster grenade" (Hu Feng's words) tactic, throwing out several big poisonous weeds at once, including *Sanjiacun Zhaji* (Sanjiacun Notes) articles "Special Treatment for 'Amnesia'" (Deng Tuo) and "Lofty Aspirations but Humble Hearts" (Liao Mosha). In this batch of big poisonous weeds, they extremely crazily cursed and attacked our Party, the Party Central Committee, and Chairman Mao. They wanted us to "quickly take a complete rest," to have "dog's blood" poured "from our heads," to "strike" our "heads, causing them to 'go into shock'" (see "Special Treatment for 'Amnesia'"); they heavily plagiarized Du Fu's "Presented to Vice Minister Wei with Twenty-Two Rhymes" and *Hou Hanshu* (Book of the Later Han Dynasty), Biography of Ban Chao, to vent their resentment against the Party and the socialist system, and to boast about their reactionary "ambitions" (see "Lofty Aspirations but Humble Hearts").
    The reactionary content of these articles is largely the same, mutually coordinated, mutually complementary, and mutually supportive. Moreover, it is particularly noteworthy that Deng Tuo's article "Special Treatment for 'Amnesia'" reversed the "Sanjiacun's" usual method of "beating around the bush, attacking indirectly," and adopted the tactic of "going into battle bare-chested"; those who reviewed the manuscript could have recognized its intention at a glance. However, it was printed in black and white in the "Party journal." Obviously, this was a meticulously arranged, extremely fierce "offensive," a large-scale "offensive," and a truly led, organized, and planned "offensive." This "offensive" occupies an important position in the conspiratorial activities of "Sanjiacun."
    However, the "good times" did not last long; the death knell of the reactionaries—the bugle call of the revolutionary people—sounded. The Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued a great call to arms, and the class struggle of promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie entered a completely new stage. At this time, our revolutionary Party newspapers and Party journals, under this great call, with a majestic revolutionary momentum and a heroic revolutionary spirit, further launched propaganda for Mao Zedong Thought and launched a new offensive against reactionary bourgeois ideology. This was truly "a good time for propaganda," and "not a bad time for propaganda"! At this time, the demons and monsters were frightened out of their wits, and the tone of "Sanjiacun" also subsided.
    Listen: "The road ahead is still very long, who knows what problems we will encounter? It's hard to predict."
    This is what Deng Tuo said at a meeting of the *Qianxian* editorial department on November 25, 1962. At this time, *Yanshan Yehu* had already become unsustainable and had come to an end; what about *Sanjiacun Zhaji*? Obviously, it wouldn't work to continue as before; then, would it work not to run it? Of course not. Because "having a team and a position, having made a start, this is an important point that cannot be underestimated." And "we must have ambition," to make the "soul have something to rely on," to engage in some "permanent topics," so that "in the future we can fire accurately," "be able to fight, be able to stand alone," "these years have some experience, we must sum it up well... We have a responsibility to sum up the experience of running a 'Party journal' well. To sum up experience is to run it well. Whether or not to have a Party journal is decided by the 'Party.'"
    Everything is carefully arranged, everything is led, organized, and planned. That is to say, now is not the time for a large-scale offensive; the policy can only be to maintain the "team," adhere to the "position," "cultivate" soldiers, so that "in the future we can fire accurately," "be able to fight, be able to stand alone." And who ultimately decides all this? Deng Tuo revealed a very important secret here: "Whether or not to have a Party journal is decided by the 'Party.'"
    "Is decided by the 'Party'." Excellent! Then, we want to ask: what "Party" is this "Party"? Which class's "Party"? Of course, this is definitely not our Party, definitely not the Party of the proletariat, definitely not the Chinese Communist Party that represents the people of the whole country, but can only be a small handful of revisionist dregs.
    Do not neglect this small handful! Look, until June 25, 1963, this gang was far from "giving up," "we must have extensive contact with the outside world," to make friends with "authors" and "friends," and to extend their tentacles all the way into "cadres of grassroots units," "like rolling a snowball, the more friends we make, the wider it rolls, constantly discovering talent in various units." Not only that, they also declared: "If I hear the Dao in the morning, I can die content in the evening!" "It's also good for people to be embarrassed, to run into things everywhere, to get bruised and battered, the scalp will also toughen, and we will have more experience, then it will be easy to handle."
    That is to say, a small group of anti-Party, anti-socialist elements has made preparations to resolutely resist to the end, taking their granite heads to see their God.
      "We must use our remaining strength to pursue the defeated enemy," don't look at these people baring their teeth and brandishing their claws, menacing and invincible, as long as we "pursue" them, expose them, and let their "snowball"-like bodies be exposed to the broad daylight, they will no longer have any strength. Now, we have "pursued" the main details of "Sanjiacun," and dragged out a group of poisonous weeds "floating on the surface," achieving preliminary and major victories. The enemy is at the end of their rope, the led, organized, and planned anti-Party, anti-socialist conspiracy of "Sanjiacun" has been completely exposed, we must continue to "pursue" the matter, "pursue" their backstage bosses, thoroughly destroy this thieving village and black shop that attempts to carry out capitalist restoration, thoroughly eliminate all revisionist toxic germs and malignant tumors, and the great socialist cultural revolution with great historical and world significance will surely achieve unprecedented brilliant victories!

    追下去，把“三家村”彻底捣毁！
    郭兴
    《〈前线〉——资本主义复辟的工具》这篇文章，提供了很有教育意义的材料。“三家村”反党集团的罪恶阴谋，又进一步败露在我们的面前了。
    我们的党、我们的人民早已看出，“三家村”的反党反社会主义的阴谋活动，是有领导、有组织、有计划的。以前揭露的大量事实，已经确凿地证明了这一点。现在，这篇十分有力的材料，更加证明了这一点。
    原来，邓拓一伙人要办一个《杂家旬刊》，是蓄谋已久的。邓拓在一九六一年三月二十六日《燕山夜话》中的《欢迎“杂家”》一文里，向他们的臭味相投的一小撮反动人物发出了“动员令”；接着，他们又仔细地制定了这种《杂家旬刊》的纲领：“要政治，整个的都是政治眼光贯串着，……不是为了光给人一些知识，……要字字是炮弹，……要专登其它刊物所不登、所没有的东西……。”这就是说，所谓“介绍一些有关的情况和知识”全是假招牌，宣扬“其它刊物所不登、所没有的”资产阶级“政治”，向党向社会主义射出“字字炮弹”，才是真货色。
    可是，这样的《杂家旬刊》，在无产阶级领导的国家里，到底是难于出场的。于是乎“把‘杂家’的灵魂”加进《前线》里去了。原来只想“拿出五分之一的篇幅”，后来一下子扩展到差不多“二分之一”。一不做，二不休，《前线》就这样成了“三家村”的反党反社会主义的工具。这个“党刊”为什么成了“杂家”手中的工具呢？这当然不是“三家村”所能够最后决定的，也不是管文教工作的书记邓拓所能够决定的。显而易见，这又是一次有领导、有组织、有计划的行动。
    到了一九六二年六月，“三家村”感到需要“停一停，研究一下”了。为什么？因为已经到了“分岔路口”。什么叫“分岔路口”？这时候，我国的暂时经济困难还没有完全克服，但形势已在好转。美帝国主义和蒋介石反动派又在福建沿海进行军事活动。在蒋介石匪帮的“反攻大陆”的叫嚣声中，一小撮牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼了。“三家村”的“弟兄”们也从中受到了“鼓舞”；但是，在这阶级斗争日趋尖锐的时刻，他们不能不“研究一下”：到底“是个好宣传的时候”呢，还“是个不好宣传的时候”呢？是消极悲观（会不会遭到党和人民的反击）呢，还是“应该积极乐观”呢？邓拓终于得出结论说：“现在是个好宣传的时候，不是个不好宣传的时候，不是没办法的时候，应该积极乐观。”
    请注意：经过六月份的“停一停，研究一下”之后，“三家村”在六月底，七月、八月初这一个多月中，使用了“集束手榴弹”（胡风语）的战法，一下子抛出好几株大毒草，其中，就有《三家村札记》里的《专治“健忘症”》（邓拓）和《志欲大而心欲小》（廖沫沙）。在这批大毒草中，他们极其疯狂地咒骂和攻击了我们的党、党中央和毛主席。他们要我们“必须赶紧完全休息”，要用“狗血”从我们的“头上淋下去”，要“打击”我们的“头部，使之‘休克’”（见《专治“健忘症”》）；他们大抄杜甫的《奉赠韦左丞二十二韵》、《后汉书》班超传，发泄他们对党对社会主义制度的愤懑，吹嘘他们的反动的“壮志”。（见《志欲大而心欲小》）
    这些文章的反动内容是大同小异的，互相配合，互相补充，互相声援的。而且，特别值得注意的是：邓拓的这一篇《专治“健忘症”》，一反“三家村”惯用的“指桑骂槐，旁敲侧击”的手法，采用了“赤膊上阵”的战术，看稿的人本来是一眼可以识破其用心的。然而，它却白纸黑字地印在“党刊”上了。显然，这是一次经过周密安排的穷凶恶极的“攻势”，是一次大规模的“攻势”，也是一次确确实实是有领导、有组织、有计划的“攻势”。这个“攻势”，在“三家村”的阴谋活动中，占有重要的地位。
    然而，“好景”不长，反动分子的丧钟——革命人民的号角响了。党的八届十中全会发出了伟大的战斗号召，兴无灭资的阶级斗争进入了一个全新的阶段。这时候，我们革命的党报和党刊，正在这个伟大号召下，以磅礴的革命气势，以雄壮的革命情怀，进一步地展开了对毛泽东思想的宣传，向反动的资产阶级思想举行了新的进攻。这倒真“是个好宣传的时候”，而“不是个不好宣传的时候”！这时候，牛鬼蛇神们却闻风丧胆了，“三家村”的调子也低沉下去了。
    请听听吧：“今后的路子还很长，谁知道还会遇到什么问题呢？很难预料。”
    这是一九六二年十一月二十五日邓拓在《前线》编辑部会议上说的话。这时候，《燕山夜话》已经保持不住，收场了；《三家村札记》怎么办呢？显然，照老样子是不行了；那么，不办行不行呢？当然不行。因为“有了个队伍和阵地，开了端，这是不可轻视的、重要的一点。”而“要有雄心”，使
  “灵魂有所寄托”，搞一些“永久性题目”，“将来可以弹不虚发”，“能打仗，能独挡一面”，“这几年有些经验，要好好总结。……我们有责任把办‘党刊’的经验好好总结起来。总结经验，就是要把它很好地办下去。要不要党刊是由‘党’决定的。”
    一切都是精心安排的，一切都是有领导、有组织、有计划的。这就是说，现在不是大举进攻的时候了，方针只能是保持“队伍”、坚持“阵地”，“培养”战士，“将来弹不虚发”、“能打仗，能独挡一面”。而这一切，到底是谁决定的呢？邓拓在这里透露出了一个极重要的秘密：“要不要党刊是由‘党’决定的”。
    “是由‘党’决定的”。好极了！那么，我们要问：这个“党”是什么“党”？是哪个阶级的“党”？当然，这决不是我们的党，决不是无产阶级的党，决不是代表全国人民的中国共产党，而只能是小小的一撮修正主义渣滓。
    不要忽视这小小的一撮啊！你看，直到一九六三年六月二十五日，这一伙人还远远没有“死心”，“和外边交往要广泛”，要结交“作者”和“朋友”，并且要把触手一直伸进“基层单位的干部”中去，“如滚雪球一样，越交越广，越滚越大，在各单位不断地发现人材。”不仅如此，他们还宣称：“朝闻道，夕死可也！”，“人狼狈一下也有好处，到处碰，碰个头破血流，头皮也硬了，经验也多了，那时就好办了”。
    这就是说，一小撮反党反社会主义分子已经做了准备，要坚决顽抗到底，带着他们花冈岩的脑袋见他们的上帝去。
      “宜将剩勇追穷寇”，别看这伙人们张牙舞爪，气势汹汹，不可一世，只要我们“追”下去，把他们揭露出来，让他们的“雪球”般的身子暴露于光天化日之下，他们就再也没有什么力量了。现在，我们已经“追”出“三家村”的主要底细，揪出了一伙“浮在表面上”的毒草，取得了初步的重大胜利。寇穷矣，“三家村”有领导、有组织、有计划反党反社会主义的阴谋已经完全败露，我们一定还要“追”下去，“追”出他们的后台老板，彻底捣毁这家企图实行资本主义复辟的贼村黑店，彻底消灭所有修正主义的毒菌恶瘤，具有伟大的历史意义和世界意义的社会主义文化大革命必将取得前所未有的光辉胜利！
