    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, May 11th, the Albanian newspaper *Bashkimi* published an editorial saying: "The success of China's third nuclear test is another huge blow to the US imperialists and modern revisionists by the great Chinese people."

    The article said: "The US imperialists and modern revisionists attempt to monopolize nuclear weapons and use them as a means of intimidating and blackmailing the people of other countries, as a powerful tool to realize their common plan of dominating the world."

    The article said: "The success of China's third nuclear test is the result of the Chinese Communist Party's wise and far-sighted policy. The Chinese Communist Party, using Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant thought, is good at exploring and mobilizing all the creative capabilities of the great and talented Chinese people, and has achieved great achievements in all aspects."

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 14th, people from all walks of life in Japan have recently successively made statements to Chinese reporters, warmly congratulating China's third nuclear test, and pointing out that this is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, which has broken the US-Soviet nuclear monopoly and made a great contribution to defending peace in Asia and the world.

    Japanese Socialist Party member of the Diet, Haruo Okada, said that the success of China's third nuclear test is of great significance for defending peace and preventing nuclear war, and is a blow to the "prevention of nuclear proliferation" that the US, Soviet Union and Britain are engaged in to maintain their nuclear monopoly.

    Nobuo Kishi, Secretary-General of the Kansai Small and Medium Enterprises Association, said that when he heard the news of China's third nuclear test, he was most prominently impressed that this was a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and also the result of China emphasizing politics in all aspects.

    He said that China's nuclear test has broken the US-Soviet nuclear monopoly and made an inestimable contribution to defending peace in Asia and the world.

    Mitsuko Koshiba, a member of the Japan-China Friendship Association Youth and Women's Delegation who had just returned from a visit to China, said that she returned to Japan with great excitement, and before she had time to give a report on her visit to China, she heard the news of the success of China's third nuclear test, and felt particularly happy. She said that she had personally seen the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shining in all aspects in China. The success of this nuclear test embodies the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

    More than twenty years ago, a Japanese friend who had suffered from the American atomic bomb disaster in Nagasaki and wished to remain anonymous, called the Osaka Prefectural Federation of the Japan-China Friendship Association after the news of the success of China's third nuclear test reached Japan, and asked them to be sure to convey the following words to China: "I shout long live the success of China's nuclear test! Long live Mao Zedong Thought!"

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, Moses, the Cairo representative of the Southwest African National Union, and Makhuloza, the leader of the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee, congratulated China on the success of the nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials here on the 10th, and pointed out that the success of this explosion was a blow to US imperialism.

    Moses told Xinhua reporters: "The success of this explosion has inspired our anti-imperialist struggle and is a heavy blow to US imperialism and its colluders who are trying to maintain a nuclear monopoly."

    He said: "We believe that since the signing of the Three-Nation Nuclear Treaty, US imperialism has used its counter-revolutionary double-dealing tactics, on the one hand advocating the prevention of nuclear proliferation, and on the other hand strengthening its own nuclear weapons testing and production, so the Chinese people's development of nuclear weapons is a revolutionary action."

    Makhuloza issued a written statement here on the 10th, saying, "This new achievement is a blow to US imperialism."

    The statement said that this new achievement proves the results achieved by the Chinese people relying on their own efforts based on Chairman Mao's thought.

    阿尔巴尼亚、日本舆论和非洲民族主义者热烈祝贺我第三次核试验
    中国核爆炸是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利
    中国打破了美苏核垄断，为保卫世界和平作出了巨大贡献
    据新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》十一日发表编辑部文章说：“中国第三次核试验成功是伟大的中国人民对美帝国主义者和现代修正主义者的又一巨大打击。”
    文章说：“美帝国主义者和现代修正主义者企图垄断核武器，把它作为恐吓和讹诈其它国家人民的手段，作为实现他们主宰世界的共同计划的一种有力手段。”
    文章说：“中国第三次核试验成功是中国共产党英明和富有远见的政策的成果。中国共产党运用毛泽东同志的辉煌思想，善于发掘和动员伟大和天才的中国人民的所有创造能力，在各方面取得了巨大的成就。”
    据新华社东京十四日电　日本各界人士最近几天相继向中国记者发表谈话，热烈祝贺中国第三次核试验的成功，并且指出这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，它打破了美苏的核垄断，为保卫亚洲与世界和平作出了巨大的贡献。
    日本社会党国会议员冈田春夫说，中国第三次核试验的成功，对保卫和平、防止核战争具有重大意义，对美苏英为了保持核垄断正在搞的“防止核扩散”是一个打击。
    关西中小企业同友会事务局局长岸信雄说，他听到中国第三次核试验的消息，首先突出地感到这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，也是中国在各方面突出政治的结果。
    他说，中国的核试验打破了美苏的核垄断，对于保卫亚洲和世界和平作出了不可估量的贡献。
    刚刚从中国访问回来的日中友好协会青年妇女代表团团员小芝满子说，她满怀兴奋的心情回到日本来，还没有来得及向大家做访华报告，就听到中国第三次核试验成功的消息，感到特别高兴。她说，她到中国亲眼看到毛泽东思想的光辉照耀在各个方面。这次核试验的成功，体现了毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    二十多年前，曾在长崎遭受过美国原子弹灾害的一个不愿透露姓名的日本朋友，在中国第三次核试验成功的消息传到日本后，打电话给日中友好协会大阪府联合会，要他们务必把他要说的下述的话转达给中国：“我高呼中国核试验成功万岁！毛泽东思想万岁！”
    据新华社开罗电　西南非洲民族联盟驻开罗代表摩尔塞斯和莫三鼻给革命委员会领导人马赫卢扎十日在这里祝贺中国含有热核材料的核爆炸成功，并且指出这次爆炸成功是对美帝国主义的打击。
    摩尔塞斯对新华社记者说：“这次爆炸成功鼓舞了我们的反帝斗争，并且是对企图保持核垄断的美帝国主义及其勾结者的沉重的打击。”
    他说：“我们认为，自从签订三国核条约以来，美帝国主义使用它的反革命两手伎俩，一方面鼓吹防止核扩散，同时又加强自己的核武器试验和生产，所以中国人民发展核武器是一个革命的行动。”
    马赫卢扎十日在这里发表一项书面声明说，“这一新的成就是对美帝国主义的打击。”
    声明说，这一新的成就证明了中国人民根据毛主席的思想、依靠自力更生所取得的成果。
