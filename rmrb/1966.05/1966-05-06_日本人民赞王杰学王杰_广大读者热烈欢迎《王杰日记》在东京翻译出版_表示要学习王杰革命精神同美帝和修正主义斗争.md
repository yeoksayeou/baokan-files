    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 3rd. Japanese readers warmly welcome the two translated versions of "Wang Jie's Diary" published successively in Japan, and they enthusiastically praise Comrade Wang Jie's revolutionary spirit.
    Tokyo's Youth Publishing House was the first to translate and publish a Japanese version of "Wang Jie's Diary" in March of this year. At the end of April, Japan's Kawade Shobo Shinsha published another translated version. Both translations also include inscriptions by Chinese national leaders commemorating Comrade Wang Jie, relevant editorials from the *People's Daily* and the *Liberation Army Daily*, as well as translations of memoirs written by Comrade Wang Jie's father and classmates.
    Mr. Iwasa, the translator of the *Wang Jie's Diary* published by Kawade Shobo Shinsha, wrote in his postscript: "A young man from the new China sacrificed himself to save the lives of twelve people. From his diary, people can see that he dedicated his youth to the revolution and that every day of his struggle was connected to Mao Zedong Thought."
    The translator also said that anti-communist countries hope that modern revisionism will appear in China in the second and third generations, but as "Wang Jie's Diary" shows, as long as Mao Zedong Thought forever occupies an unshakeable position, that kind of thing will absolutely not happen.
    Ito Keiichi, the translator of "Wang Jie's Diary" published by the Japan Youth Publishing House, said that although we and Wang Jie are carrying out struggles in different places and in different ways, our enemies are the same, namely American imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and modern revisionism. Wang Jie's heart is closely linked with our hearts and is very close. Although we feel that we are not as good as Wang Jie, we should learn from him with deep respect.
    Reader Sato Mitsuyoshi said in the *Reading Friends* newspaper published on the 2nd when discussing his experience of reading this book that, ""The reason why Wang Jie's Diary" can cross national borders and firmly grasp the heart of a Japanese youth like me is because Wang Jie's death showed his unlimited trust in the motherland, the people, and the Party, as well as his spirit of self-sacrifice, because Wang Jie combined learning and practice and strictly carried out self-transformation, and because Wang Jie demonstrated a strong hatred for American imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and modern revisionism, and a fiery proletarian internationalist spirit.
    Yoshiro Hirano, chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, once recommended this book to readers, saying that "Wang Jie's Diary" is spiritual food and is worth studying carefully. (Attached picture)

    日本人民赞王杰学王杰
    广大读者热烈欢迎《王杰日记》在东京翻译出版
    表示要学习王杰革命精神同美帝和修正主义斗争
    新华社东京三日电  日本广大读者热烈欢迎在日本先后出版的两种《王杰日记》的译本，他们热情地赞扬王杰同志的革命精神。
    东京的青年出版社在今年三月首先翻译出版了《王杰日记》的日文译本；四月底，日本河出书店出版了另一种译本。这两种译本还刊载了中国国家领导人纪念王杰同志的题词、《人民日报》和《解放军报》的有关社论以及王杰同志的父亲和同学等写的回忆录的译文。
    河出书店出版的《王杰日记》的译者岩佐氏健在译后记中写道：“一个新中国青年牺牲了自己一个人而拯救了十二个人的生命。人们从他的日记中看到，他把青春献给革命，他战斗的每一天都同毛泽东思想联系着。”
    译者还说，反共国家期望中国在第二代、第三代出现现代修正主义，但是正象《王杰日记》所表明的那样，只要毛泽东思想永远占据不可动摇的地位，那种事情是绝对不会发生的。
    日本青年出版社出版的《王杰日记》的译者伊藤敬一说，我们和王杰虽然是在不同的地方、用不同方式进行着斗争，但我们的敌人是共同的，那就是美帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义。王杰的心和我们的心紧密地联结在一起，非常亲近。我们虽然感到我们不如王杰，但是应当怀着深深的敬意向他学习。
    读者佐藤光良在二日出版的《读书之友》报上谈到他读过这本书的心得时说，《王杰日记》所以能越过国界，紧紧抓住象我这样的一个日本青年的心，是因为王杰的死表现了他对祖国、对人民和对党的无限信任以及自我牺牲精神，是因为王杰把学习和实践结合一起，严格地进行自我改造，是因为王杰表现了对美帝国主义、各国反动派以及现代修正主义的强烈憎恨和火一般的无产阶级国际主义精神。
    日本和平委员会会长平野义太郎曾经向读者推荐这本书，他说，《王杰日记》是精神粮食，值得好好学习。（附图片）
