    Thoroughly Uproot the Old Roots of the "Three-Family Village"
    The Communist Party and Chairman Mao pulled us poor and lower-middle peasants out of the sea of fire. The Deng Tuo gang vainly attempts to push us back into the sea of fire. This is something that will never, ever happen!
    Li Yansong, Delegate to the National People's Congress, Secretary of the Longquan Commune Party Committee, Huaining County, Anhui Province
    In recent days, I have seen materials in the newspapers exposing the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of the Deng Tuo clique. Deng Tuo's sinister words make me angrier the more I read them, and the more I think about them, the more infuriated I become. This gang of Deng Tuo, wearing red hats and carrying black flags, shoots poisonous arrows and fires black guns at our great Party. This is a life-and-death class struggle. We poor and lower-middle peasants must stand at the forefront of this struggle and never give up until we defeat them!
    We poor and lower-middle peasants suffered the deepest exploitation and the heaviest oppression in the old society. We understand the bitterness of the old society best, and we also understand the sweetness of the new society best. Deng Tuo, you shouted loudly, demanding that our Party quickly step down and "rest." Doesn't this mean letting you come to power, letting the bourgeoisie restore itself, and letting the landlords ride on our heads again! The Communist Party and Chairman Mao pulled us out of the sea of fire. You vainly attempt to push us back into the sea of fire. This is something that will never, ever happen.
    Deng Tuo, you said that the Great Leap Forward was "bragging" and "boasting." May I ask: Do you have eyes? Which of the thousands of people's communes across the country is not constantly developing production? Take our Longquan Commune as an example; it has also undergone earth-shaking changes. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we established a forest farm. In a few years, we planted trees on all 8,000 mu of barren mountains. There are 800 mu of economic forests such as peaches, pears, apples, raw lacquer, and tung oil, which have already yielded profits. In recent years, we have built a large number of water conservancy projects, solving the irrigation problems for 70 percent of the paddy fields and a portion of the dry land in the commune. Our land here used to be "as hard as stone when dry, as sticky as to bind the hoe when it rains, plowing three inches hits stones, and crops don't grow well." After moving sand to improve the soil since 1958, it has now become fertile sandy loam. In 1965, the grain yield per mu in our commune increased three times compared to before liberation. With the development of production, the lives of the commune members have also greatly improved.
    Deng Tuo, I ask you, are these changes not the victory of the Great Leap Forward? You are telling lies with your eyes open, trying to distort right and wrong, in order to achieve your anti-Party and anti-socialist goals. Let me tell you, we are participants in the Great Leap Forward and witnesses to the Great Leap Forward. Your distortion of right and wrong can only make us see your ugly anti-Party and anti-socialist face more clearly.
    Deng Tuo, you also falsely accused our Party's leadership of being "self-righteous and looking down on the masses." This is something we cannot agree to either. In the old society, we poor people were not even as good as cattle and horses, and we had no right to speak at all. In the new society, we poor and lower-middle peasants are the pillars of the people's commune and the masters of the country. I was elected as a delegate to the National People's Congress to participate in the discussion of national affairs.
    All the principles and policies of our Party are in line with the interests of the people of the whole country. Deng Tuo, your accusation that the Party is "self-righteous and looks down on the masses" is a deliberate attempt to undermine the Party's leadership prestige, destroy the link between the Party and the masses, and make the masses listen to your sinister words and follow your evil path. Let me tell you, although we are less literate than you, we are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Our eyes are bright, and no matter how insidious you are, you cannot deceive us.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "After the enemies with guns have been wiped out, there still exist enemies without guns; they are bound to struggle desperately against us, and we must in no way underestimate these enemies." The monsters and demons of the "Three-Family Village" are such enemies. They release a large number of poisonous arrows, vainly attempting to destroy the people's Jiangshan. If you don't strike these reactionary fellows, they will not fall. Therefore, we must aim at this anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang, strike them hard, beat them to pieces, and thoroughly uproot their old roots.

    彻底挖掉“三家村”的老根
    共产党和毛主席把我们贫下中农从火海里拉出来，邓拓黑帮妄想把我们再推到火海里，这是一万个办不到的事
    全国人民代表大会代表安徽怀宁县龙泉公社党委书记  李焰松
    这几天，从报纸上看到揭发邓拓一伙反党反社会主义罪行的材料。邓拓的黑话，使我越看越生气，越想越恼火。邓拓这一伙人，戴着红帽子，扛着黑旗，向我们伟大的党射毒箭、放黑枪。这是一场你死我活的阶级斗争。我们贫下中农在这场斗争中，要站到最前列，不把它斗垮决不罢休！
    我们贫下中农在旧社会，受剥削最深，受压迫最重。我们最懂得旧社会的苦，也最懂得新社会的甜。邓拓，你大喊大叫，要我们党赶快下台“休息”，这不就是说让你上台，让资产阶级复辟，让地主再骑到我们头上吗！共产党和毛主席把我们从火海里拉出来，你妄想把我们再往火海里推，这是一万个办不到的事情。
    邓拓，你说大跃进是“说大话”、“吹牛皮”，试问：你长眼睛没有？全国千万个人民公社，那一个不是生产不断发展？就拿我们龙泉公社来说，也是起了翻天覆地的变化。一九五八年大跃进中，我们办起了林场，几年工夫，将八千亩光秃秃的荒山全部栽上了树，有八百亩桃、梨、苹果、生漆、油桐等经济林，已经有了收益。几年来修建了大量的水利工程，解决了全社百分之七十的水田和一部分旱地的灌溉问题。我们这里的土地，过去是“天干硬得象石头，落雨粘得卡锄头，翻犁三寸碰石头，生长庄稼不勾头”，经过一九五八年以来搬沙改良土壤，现在也变成了肥沃的沙壤田。一九六五年，我们全社粮食亩产量比解放前提高了三倍。随着生产的发展，社员生活也有很大提高。
    邓拓，我问你，这些变化，难道不是大跃进的胜利吗？你睁眼说瞎话，无非是想颠倒黑白，以便达到你反党反社会主义的目的。告诉你，我们是大跃进的参加者，是大跃进的见证人，你这样颠倒是非，只能使我们更加看清你的反党反社会主义的丑恶面目。
    邓拓，你还诬蔑我们党的领导“自作聪明，看不起群众”，这也是我们不能答应的。在旧社会，我们穷人连牛马都不如，根本没有说话的权利。在新社会，我们贫下中农是人民公社的顶梁柱，是国家的主人，我被选为全国人民代表大会的代表，参与讨论国家大事。
    我们党的一切方针政策，都是符合全国人民利益的。邓拓，你诬蔑党“自作聪明，看不起群众”，是有意打击党的领导威信，破坏党和人民群众的联系，想叫群众听你的黑话，跟你走邪道。告诉你，我们虽然识字比你少一些，但却是用毛泽东思想武装起来的，我们的眼睛是挺亮的，你再阴险，也是骗不了我们的。
    毛主席教导我们：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”“三家村”这一伙牛鬼蛇神，就是这样的敌人。他们放出大批毒箭，妄想把人民的江山搞垮。对这些反动家伙，你不打，他是不倒的。因此，我们要对准这个反党反社会主义黑帮，狠狠地打，打得它落花流水，彻底挖掉他们的老根。
