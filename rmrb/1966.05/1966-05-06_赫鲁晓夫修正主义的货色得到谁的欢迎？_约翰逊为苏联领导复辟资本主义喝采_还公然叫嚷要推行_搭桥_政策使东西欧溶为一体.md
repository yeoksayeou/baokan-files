    According to Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 5th—In a speech in Washington on the 3rd, U.S. President Johnson openly expressed his welcome for the Soviet revisionist leading group's vigorous promotion of the principle of profit and material incentives to restore capitalism. Johnson also reiterated that in order to promote the peaceful evolution of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, the United States will continue to pursue its "bridge" policy.

    Speaking at the "Millennium Anniversary of Polish Statehood and Catholicism Conference," Johnson said that "Poland and some of its Eastern European neighbors are realizing the vitality of individual initiative." He said that in these countries, more decentralized decision-making has been allowed, rather than centralized state control, and there is a better understanding of profit motives and individual incentives. "There is a growing recognition that profit is a better measure of productivity, and that efficient actions beneficial to the national economy can be better promoted through individual incentives."

    Johnson was elated by this development in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, saying, "If they reflect a willingness to respond to reality, then the seeds of genuine confidence—the seeds that things can indeed change—are present."

    Johnson said that to this end, he had instructed the State Department to ask Congress to agree to expand trade with Eastern European countries and to take other steps to build bridges "across the gulf separating us from Eastern Europe."

    Johnson made it clear that one of the important contents of his "bridge" policy is to "engage in peaceful trade intimately" with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. However, he made no secret of the U.S. imperialist ambition to engage in such trade, which is: this trade "can, over a period of time, influence Eastern European society and develop it in a direction conducive to world peace." He believes that now "is the time to take action" in this regard.

    According to Johnson's aides quoted by the U.S. Information Service, in expanding trade with Eastern European countries, the U.S. government will ask Congress to authorize Johnson to extend most-favored-nation treatment to the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries on a reciprocal basis.

    In his speech, Johnson put forward a blueprint for a future Europe that he envisions integrating Eastern and Western Europe, which is to "eliminate artificial political barriers that hinder the free flow of people, ideas, and trade," "arms control agreements with international inspection," and Eastern and Western European countries "become friends who depend on each other," "the people of each country know the responsibility and rewards of free political choice."

    Johnson stated that in order to "help build this kind of Europe," the United States will adopt a two-pronged counter-revolutionary strategy that combines both soft and hard tactics. In the hard tactic, Johnson emphasized that the United States must still rely on the North Atlantic Group, which is already disintegrating. He emphasized that the alliance between the United States and Western Europe is still "the foundation of European security, unity, and progress," and that "Western European countries can only play their due role in the world family by strengthening cooperation. From this base of cooperation, fruitful contacts with the East can be best established." "Integrated Atlantic defense" and "the West European unification movement" are "top priorities" for promoting the U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries.

    Johnson also said that the United States will "encourage all constructive efforts to strengthen people-to-people, cultural, and trade ties between Eastern and Western Europe." He also echoed West Germany's recent "peace offensive," clamoring that the United States should "continue to seek to improve relations between the German people and Europeans in their east, and to peacefully resolve the division of Germany under the principle of self-determination."

    Johnson mentioned some of the personnel and cultural exchanges that the United States has already begun with Eastern European countries, especially Poland, and he made no secret of the U.S. imperialist wolfish ambitions. He said, "These steps are small, but everything starts small. From these steps, we can take other steps to help revive the currents of knowledge, commerce, and culture that once prevailed in Europe—from London to Budapest, from Warsaw to Paris, from Frankfurt to Krakow, from Prague to Brussels."

    U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Goldberg also spoke on the same anniversary in Chicago on the 1st, saying that there were many signs that there were "new and more hopeful relations between Eastern and Western Europe," and expressed warm welcome to the "liberalization" of Eastern European countries.

### 赫鲁晓夫修正主义的货色得到谁的欢迎？  约翰逊为苏联领导复辟资本主义喝采  还公然叫嚷要推行“搭桥”政策使东西欧溶为一体

    赫鲁晓夫修正主义的货色得到谁的欢迎？
    约翰逊为苏联领导复辟资本主义喝采
    还公然叫嚷要推行“搭桥”政策使东西欧溶为一体
    据新华社五日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统约翰逊三日在华盛顿的一次讲话中公开表示欢迎苏联修正主义领导集团大搞利润原则和物质刺激，以复辟资本主义。约翰逊还重申，为了促进苏联和东欧国家的和平演变，美国将继续推行它的“搭桥”政策。
    约翰逊在“纪念波兰建国和建教一千周年大会”上讲话时说，“波兰和它的东欧一些邻国正在意识到个人进取心的活力”。他说，在这些国家里，已经允许比较分散地作出决定，而不是集中的国家控制，并且对利润动机和个人刺激有了较好的理解。“人们越来越认识到：利润是衡量生产率的较好的尺度，通过个人刺激可以更好地推进有利于国民经济的效率高的行动。”
    约翰逊对苏联和东欧国家的这种事态发展欢欣鼓舞，他说，“如果它们反映了愿意响应现实，那么真正信心的种子——事情的确可能发生改变的种子——已经存在。”
    约翰逊说，为此，他已经指示国务院要求国会同意扩大同东欧国家的贸易，并且将采取其他步骤，以便在“把我们同东欧隔开的海湾上”搭桥。
    约翰逊表明，他的“搭桥”政策的重要内容之一就是同苏联和东欧国家“亲切地进行和平贸易”，但是，他毫不掩饰美帝国主义搞这种贸易的野心，这就是：这种贸易“在一段时期后能够影响东欧社会，使其沿着有利于世界和平的方向发展下去”。他认为目前在这方面“是采取行动的时候了”。
    据美新处引约翰逊的助手的话说，在扩大同东欧国家的贸易上，美国政府将要求国会授权约翰逊把最惠国待遇在相互的基础上扩大到苏联和其他东欧国家。
    约翰逊在讲话中提出了一个他所设想的使东西欧溶为一体的未来的欧洲的蓝图，这就是“消除阻挠人员、思想和贸易自由流动的人为的政治障碍”，“有国际视察的军备监督协议”，东西欧国家“成为互相依靠的朋友”，“每个国家的人民知道自由政治选择的责任和收获”。
    约翰逊表示，为了“帮助建立这种欧洲”，美国将采取软硬兼施的反革命两手战略。在硬的一手中，约翰逊强调，美国仍然要依靠目前已经分崩离析的北大西洋集团。他强调说，美国和西欧的联盟仍然是“欧洲安全、团结和前进的基础”，“西欧国家只有加强合作才能起它们在世界大家庭中的正当作用。从这个合作的基地，才能最好地建立同东部的有成果的联系”。“一体化的大西洋防务”和“西欧的统一运动”对于推行美国对苏联和东欧国家的政策是“头等需要的”。
    约翰逊还说，美国将“鼓励为加强东欧和西方之间人员、文化和贸易联系的一切建设性努力”。他还配合西德最近的“和平攻势”，叫嚷美国要“继续设法增进德国人民和在他们东部的欧洲人之间的关系，并且在自决原则下和平解决德国分裂的问题”。
    约翰逊谈到美国同东欧国家、特别是波兰已经开始的一些人员和文化交往，他毫不掩饰美帝国主义的狼子野心。他说，“这些步骤是小的，但是，一切事情的开头都是小的。从这些步骤开始，我们就可以采取其他步骤，以帮助复活曾经一度盛行于欧洲——从伦敦到布达佩斯、从华沙到巴黎、从法兰克福到克拉科夫、从布拉格到布鲁塞尔——的知识、商业和文化的潮流。”
    美国驻联合国代表戈德堡一日在芝加哥就同一个纪念日发表谈话时也谈到许多迹象表明“东欧和西方之间有新的更有希望的关系”，并且对东欧国家的“自由化”表示热烈欢迎。
