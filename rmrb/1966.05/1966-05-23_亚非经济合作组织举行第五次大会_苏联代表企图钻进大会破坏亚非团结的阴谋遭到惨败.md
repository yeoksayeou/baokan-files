    Xinhua News Agency, Casablanca, May 22nd – The Fifth Conference of the Asian-African Economic Cooperation Organization was held in Beni Mellal and Casablanca, Morocco, from May 16th to 19th.

    Delegations from more than twenty Asian-African countries, including China, Morocco, Pakistan, Guinea, Mali, the United Arab Republic, and Japan, attended the conference.

    Hou Tong, head of the Chinese delegation and Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, delivered a speech at the conference, putting forward proposals for developing economic cooperation between Asian and African countries.

    During the conference, the Uzbek Chamber of Commerce of the Soviet Union, under the instigation of the Soviet modern revisionist leading group, tried every possible means to infiltrate the Asian-African Economic Cooperation Organization, deliberately creating obstacles for this conference in an attempt to undermine Asian-African unity. This sinister plot suffered a miserable defeat.

    At the meeting of the Administrative Council of the Asian-African Economic Cooperation Organization held on the eve of the conference, the Chinese delegation exposed this conspiracy and pointed out that the Fifth Conference of the Asian-African Economic Cooperation Organization must absolutely not discuss the issue of accepting the Soviet Union's Uzbek Chamber of Commerce into the Asian-African Economic Cooperation Organization. The Chinese representative emphasized: According to the charter of the Asian-African Economic Cooperation Organization, only Asian and African countries have the right to be accepted into this organization. However, Uzbekistan is merely a republic within the Soviet Union, and its central government is in faraway Moscow, in Europe. The Soviet modern revisionist leading group actually wants one of its republics to be on an equal footing with Asian and African sovereign states. This is typical great-power chauvinism and an insult to Asian and African countries. This solemn stance of the Chinese delegation was supported by several representatives. Taking into account the charter of the Asian-African Economic Cooperation Organization and based on the opinions of the representatives, the Council finally decided not to discuss the issue of accepting the Soviet Union’s Uzbek Chamber of Commerce into this organization during the Fifth Conference of the Asian-African Economic Cooperation Organization. The Soviet Union's Uzbek Chamber of Commerce was not reconciled to this defeat and continued to create difficulties for the conference, which aroused dissatisfaction among many participants in the conference. Some representatives said: The Soviet Union is neither an Asian country nor an African country, so it has no right to be accepted into the Asian-African Economic Cooperation Organization at all. If it comes in, what will this Asian-African organization become? Due to the opposition of many representatives, the Soviet Union's Uzbek Chamber of Commerce's attempt to illegally squeeze into the Asian-African Economic Cooperation Organization at this conference finally failed.

    This conference also adopted resolutions on sectoral economic cooperation, resolutions on the role of member states of the Asian-African Economic Cooperation Organization in developing the economy, and resolutions on convening the Asian-African Shipping Conference, among others.

    At the closing meeting on the 19th, Morocco was elected as the chairman of this organization, and Iraq and Guinea were elected as vice-chairmen.

    The conference also elected a new council consisting of fifteen countries, including China, Pakistan, Guinea, Mali, Morocco, the United Arab Republic, and Japan.

### 亚非经济合作组织举行第五次大会  苏联代表企图钻进大会破坏亚非团结的阴谋遭到惨败

    亚非经济合作组织举行第五次大会
    苏联代表企图钻进大会破坏亚非团结的阴谋遭到惨败
    新华社卡萨布兰卡二十二日电　亚非经济合作组织第五次大会五月十六日至十九日在摩洛哥的贝尼麦拉尔和卡萨布兰卡举行。
    出席大会的有来自中国、摩洛哥、巴基斯坦、几内亚、马里、阿联、日本等二十多个亚非国家的代表团。
    中国代表团团长、中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席侯桐在大会上发了言，提出了关于发展亚非国家之间的经济合作的主张。
    在大会期间，苏联乌兹别克商会根据苏联现代修正主义领导集团的指使，千方百计地想钻进亚非经济合作组织，蓄意为这次大会制造障碍，企图破坏亚非团结。这一阴险的图谋遭到了惨败。
    在大会前夕举行的亚非经济合作组织行政理事会会议上，中国代表团揭露了这一阴谋，并且指出，亚非经济合作组织第五次大会绝对不能讨论接受苏联的乌兹别克商会参加亚非经济合作组织的问题。中国代表着重指出：根据亚非经济合作组织的章程，只有亚非国家才有权被接受参加这一组织。可是乌兹别克不过是苏联的一个加盟共和国，它的中央政府是在遥远的莫斯科，在欧洲。苏联现代修正主义领导集团竟然要它的一个加盟共和国同亚非主权国家平起平坐，这是典型的大国沙文主义，是对亚非国家的侮辱。中国代表团的这一严正立场得到了好些代表的支持。理事会考虑到亚非经济合作组织的章程，并且根据代表们的意见，最后决定在亚非经济合作组织第五次大会期间不讨论关于接受苏联乌兹别克商会参加这个组织的问题。苏联乌兹别克商会不甘心于这个失败，仍然为大会制造困难，这引起了大会许多参加者的不满。有的代表说：苏联既不是亚洲国家也不是非洲国家，因此它根本无权被接受参加亚非经济合作组织。如果它进来了，那么这个亚非组织会变成什么样子呢？由于许多代表的反对，苏联乌兹别克商会在这次大会上非法挤进亚非经济合作组织的图谋终于没有得逞。
    这次大会，还通过了关于部门性经济协作的决议，关于亚非经济合作组织会议成员国在发展经济方面的作用的决议，以及关于召开亚非航运会议等决议。
    在十九日的闭幕会议上选举摩洛哥为这个组织的主席，伊拉克和几内亚为副主席。
    大会还选举了由中国、巴基斯坦、几内亚、马里、摩洛哥、阿联、日本等十五个国家组成的新的理事会。
