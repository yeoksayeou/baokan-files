    The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres in the Pearl River Delta, a model agricultural area of the Dazhai type built during the Great Leap Forward, angrily condemned the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of the "Three-Family Village" black gang. They said: The Deng Tuo gang opposes the Party and socialism, which means they oppose us poor and lower-middle peasants and oppose Mao Zedong Thought. We must hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, wage a resolute struggle against the Deng Tuo gang, and thoroughly crush the "Three-Family Village" black den!

    The Great Leap Forward Created Countless Miracles, a Great Victory for Mao Zedong Thought

    Cui Hong, secretary of the Tea Mountain Commune Party Committee in Dongguan County, a pacesetter in self-reliance and hard struggle in the Pearl River Delta, said at a symposium criticizing Deng Tuo: We Tea Mountain people are very angry to hear that the Deng Tuo black gang is attacking the Great Leap Forward. Tea Mountain was originally a low-lying river滩地 [tāndì, alluvial land], with over 18,000 mu [亩, a Chinese unit of area] of rice paddies submerged in water out of 26,000 mu. The people of Tea Mountain suffered greatly from floods, with people starving to death every year before liberation. Poor and lower-middle peasants fled to other places every year, selling their sons and daughters, and their lives were very miserable. After liberation, especially under the glorious illumination of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, Tea Mountain began to undergo earth-shaking changes. During the years of the Great Leap Forward, we built five large embankments totaling more than forty li [里, a Chinese unit of distance], and eighty-two small embankments, and we also built six large electric drainage and irrigation stations and seventy-three small electric drainage and irrigation stations, permanently conquering the disasters. During the period of agricultural cooperation, Tea Mountain still needed the state to supply four to five million jin [斤, a Chinese unit of weight] of grain every year. Starting in 1963, Tea Mountain became a commune with an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu, the lives of the commune members were greatly improved, and they provided the state with more than 12 million jin of commodity grain every year. Without the Great Leap Forward, there would be no Tea Mountain today; without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no Tea Mountain today. Deng Tuo, you attack the Great Leap Forward as "bragging" and "talking big," we Tea Mountain people will never let you go, and we will settle accounts with you.

    Huang Weining, secretary of the Wanqingsha Commune Party Committee in Panyu County, and Liang Beisheng, secretary of the Minjian Brigade Party Branch, said: We personally participated in the Great Leap Forward and understand the facts of the Great Leap Forward best. Deng Tuo is lying with his eyes open and has no right to speak at all. In 1958, according to the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao, we dared to think and dare to act, and we created countless miracles. Taking our Wanqingsha Commune as an example, the mess left over from the old society was one of poverty and blankness. After several years of hard work in communization and the Great Leap Forward, a power grid was hung in the air, and stone embankments were built by the sea. The twenty-six electric drainage and irrigation stations can drain when we want to drain and irrigate when we want to irrigate, and we are not afraid of internal waterlogging or sea waves collapsing the embankments. In the advanced cooperative, our commune only had six tractors. After the Great Leap Forward, this increased to eighteen, and we also added eighteen electric mud dredgers and eighty electric threshers. We also established machinery factories, rice-milling and pulping processing plants, stone quarries, and so on on flat ground. Before communization, in years with favorable weather conditions, the average yield of rice was only six or seven hundred jin per mu. After 1958, we have achieved large-scale increases in production year after year, with an average yield of 1,200 jin per mu last year.

    He Ben, an old poor peasant from the Pingnan Brigade of the Pingzhou Commune in Nanhai County, said: The Communist Party is the most realistic and has never exaggerated or bragged. Before liberation, we poor and lower-middle peasants suffered. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party said that they wanted to liberate the working people, so they led the people of the whole country to make revolution. Thousands of revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives to liberate us and built a new country. After liberation, the Party and Chairman Mao said that they wanted to make the peasants jointly prosperous, so they led us to organize and take the road of agricultural cooperation. Chairman Mao said that we should quickly change the backward situation of poverty and blankness, so he led us to hold high the great red banner of the General Line and realized the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, making our lives better day by day. The Communist Party does what it says. The Deng Tuo gang cursed the Party and Chairman Mao, which shows that they are irreconcilable with us poor and lower-middle peasants. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are our close friends, and no matter who slanders the Party and Chairman Mao, we will fight him to the end.

    The Party and Chairman Mao Cherish the Laboring People Most and Teach Us to Rely on Our Own Efforts to Change the World

    Zuo Feng, leader of the Daji Production Team of the Shiqiao Brigade of the Pingzhou Commune in Nanhai County and an activist in studying Chairman Mao's works, said: Deng Tuo said that the ruling classes in history knew how to cherish the labor force and slandered our Party for "not cherishing the labor force." This is really turning black and white upside down. In the past, the landlords rode on the heads of us peasants, telling us to die and we died, telling us to live and we lived. We had no place to complain about our suffering. Where do these bloodsuckers talk about "cherishing the labor force"? I was forced to be a slave girl at the age of eleven, and I had to wash the landlord's wife's feet, scratch her back, fan her, and pour tea and water every day, from before dawn to midnight, regardless of my life or death. The landlords and capitalists used us as cattle and horses, and only the Communist Party truly cherishes us. In a few years, our lives have improved more than tenfold. Every household has three meals a day, surplus grain, and surplus money. Thatched huts have become brick houses. All of this was brought to us by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party! If we do what Deng Tuo's ghost idea says, we won't even have porridge to eat. If our country does not change the backward situation of poverty and blankness, won't our descendants have to be bullied by imperialism and revisionism forever?

    Lu Xixiang, a poor peasant commune member of the Lubian Brigade of the Tea Mountain Commune in Dongguan County, said: We poor and lower-middle peasants urgently demand to change the face of disaster. The Party and Chairman Mao are most concerned about our fundamental interests, cherish us most, and teach us not to rely on heaven or earth, but to rely on the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. We Tea Mountain people are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and rely on our own hands and the strength of the collective economy to fight against the sky and the earth and build many water conservancy projects, transforming the disaster-stricken Tea Mountain into a new socialist countryside with water conservancy and electrification. In the past, if it didn't rain for three days in our brigade, we had to send out many people to carry water nine grades and thirteen grades, working day and night to fight drought, year after year. Now we don't have to work so hard. Deng Tuo slandered water conservancy construction as "not cherishing the labor force," which is opposing us listening to Chairman Mao's words and opposing us transforming nature, vainly trying to make us slaves of disaster forever and not allowing us to turn over. We say that self-reliance and hard struggle are the magic weapons for turning over and making revolution. The more Deng Tuo opposes us, the more we will do what Chairman Mao instructs us to do.

    Guo Weizhu, deputy captain of the Pingnan Brigade of the Pingzhou Commune in Nanhai County, said: Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionaries and the landlord class did not care about our lives or deaths. There was no water conservancy construction here at all. Heavy rain brought heavy disasters, and light rain brought light disasters. We often woke up in the middle of the night with water flooding our beds, and we drifted around all year round. After liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, we have built a water conservancy network, and we can ensure a good harvest regardless of floods or droughts. This is the demand of our poor and lower-middle peasants, and this is the greatest care that the Party gives us. The Deng Tuo black gang nonsensically said that the Party "does not cherish the labor force," with the aim of provoking our relationship with the Party, not allowing us to make a Great Leap Forward, and vainly trying to make us poor and lower-middle peasants follow them on the black road of capitalist restoration. We poor and lower-middle peasants deeply know that the Party loves us the most, and we also love the Party the most. We will always follow the Party.

    The Socialist Family Property is Very Solid, and Even a Level 12 Typhoon Cannot Blow it Down

    Zhong Daigen, militia battalion commander of the Shawei Brigade of the Wanqingsha Commune in Panyu County, said: Deng Tuo slandered our socialist cause as "the property of one egg" and "one punch can smash the property to pieces." This is the most vicious slander. Deng Tuo, listen to this: How can you allow the property created by the hard work of hundreds of millions of working people to be "completely destroyed"! People like me, who came from a bitter background, were forced by landlords and bullies in the old society to have no clothes or food. My parents, brothers, and sisters died or left. I had no "family" at all, let alone any "property." After liberation, the Party and Chairman Mao led us to carry out land reform, establish cooperatives, and establish people's communes. Only then did we have a family and property, and it was not the property of one family, but the socialist family property built on the basis of the collective economy.

    Chen Yaolin, secretary of the Minli Brigade Party Branch, said: Before liberation, we were located at the mouth of the Pearl River. The seawall was thin, and typhoons would collapse the embankment, and the water would flood the fields. Coupled with the exploitation and oppression of the landlords, people died and families were scattered. After liberation, especially after several years of hard struggle since the Great Leap Forward, all of the more than 100 kilometers of seawall have been piled up with large stones, basically realizing stone embankments. Floods, typhoons, and salty tides have all been resisted. Can Deng Tuo's black fist smash such property? No! Our property cannot be blown down even by a level 12 typhoon!

    Cai Yaojia, secretary of the Shangyuan Brigade Party Branch of the Tea Mountain Commune in Dongguan County, said: Deng Tuo, the owner of this "Three-Family Village" black den, hates socialism so deeply that he even wants to overthrow our socialist iron country. He is really overestimating himself. Our socialist family property is being consolidated and developed every day. Taking our Shangyuan Brigade as an example, the collective property that has been built up now amounts to more than one million yuan [元, Chinese monetary unit]. Our property can withstand droughts and cannot be washed away by torrential rains. In 1963, we were not afraid of the drought that lasted for more than seven months, and we still achieved a great harvest. Deng Tuo slandered us for building socialism as "moneygrubbers." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao, our workers and peasants know that building socialism is for the revolution, that is, to make revolution against poverty and backwardness, and also to make revolution against all of you class enemies. We must also make more contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution to consolidate our socialist country.

    Cui Hong, secretary of the Tea Mountain Commune Party Committee, and Cai Yaojia, secretary of the Shangyuan Brigade Party Branch, said: Mao Zedong Thought is a sharp weapon that wins every battle. With Mao Zedong Thought, we have achieved the victory of the revolution and the brilliant achievements of socialist construction. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can ensure that our revolution will never change color and that we can defeat all the attacks of class enemies. Mao Zedong Thought is infinitely radiant. All demons and monsters, no matter how insidious, cunning, and hidden they are, will reveal their reactionary true colors as long as they are illuminated by Mao Zedong Thought. The Deng Tuo gang opposes Mao Zedong Thought. We must hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and thoroughly crush this gang of black thugs in the "Three-Family Village."

### 珠江三角洲广大贫农下中农和农村干部  用铁的事实回击“三家村”黑帮的污蔑

    珠江三角洲广大贫农下中农和农村干部
    用铁的事实回击“三家村”黑帮的污蔑
    在大跃进中建设起来的大寨式农业典型地区珠江三角洲的广大贫下中农和农村干部，愤怒斥责“三家村”黑帮反党反社会主义的罪行。他们说：邓拓一伙反对党，反对社会主义，就是反对我们贫下中农，就是反对毛泽东思想。我们一定更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向邓拓一伙作坚决斗争，把“三家村”黑店彻底打垮！
    大跃进创造无数人间奇迹，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利
    珠江三角洲自力更生、艰苦奋斗的标兵——东莞县茶山公社举行了批判邓拓座谈会，公社党委书记崔洪说：听到邓拓黑帮攻击大跃进，我们茶山人十分气愤。茶山原来是一片低洼的河滩地，二万六千亩稻田中，一万八千多亩是汪洋一片，十年九不收。茶山人受尽了涝灾的苦难，解放前年年饿死人，贫下中农年年往外逃荒，卖儿卖女，生活十分悲惨。解放后，特别是在总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉照耀下，茶山开始发生了翻天覆地的变化。在大跃进的几年间，我们从水底筑起了五条共四十多里长的大堤，和八十二条小堤，又建成了六座大型电力排灌站，和七十三座小型电力排灌站，永远把灾害治服了。合作化时，茶山每年还要国家供应四五百万斤粮食，一九六三年开始，茶山便成为平均亩产千斤的公社，社员生活大改善，年年为国家提供一千二百多万斤商品粮。没有大跃进就没有今天的茶山，没有毛泽东思想，就没有今天的茶山。邓拓，你攻击大跃进是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”，我们茶山人决不放过你，要同你算账。
    番禺县万倾沙公社党委书记黄伟宁、民建大队党支部书记梁北胜说：我们亲身投入大跃进，最了解大跃进的事实，邓拓瞪着眼睛说瞎话，根本没有发言权。一九五八年，我们按照党和毛主席的指示，敢想敢干，不知创造了多少人间奇迹。就拿我们万倾沙公社来说，旧社会遗留下来的烂摊子是一穷二白的，经过公社化和大跃进的几年艰苦奋斗，空中挂起了电网，海边筑起了石堤，二十六个电动排灌站，要排就排，要灌就灌，不怕内涝积水，不怕海浪崩堤。我们公社在高级社时，只有六台拖拉机，大跃进后，就增加到十八台，还添了电动绞泥机十八部，电动脱粒机八十部。还在平地上建立了机械厂、辗米打浆加工厂、石矿场，等等。公社化以前，碰上风调雨顺的年月，水稻产量全年平均亩产不过六七百斤，一九五八年以后，连年获得大面积增产，去年平均亩产一千二百斤。
    南海县平洲公社平南大队老贫农何本说：共产党最讲实事求是，从来没说过大话，吹过牛皮。解放前，我们贫下中农受苦受难，毛主席、共产党讲要解放劳苦人民，就领导全国人民闹革命，千千万万革命烈士，为了解放我们连性命也舍了出来，建成了新国家。解放后，党和毛主席说要使农民共同富裕，就领导我们组织起来，走农业合作化的道路。毛主席说要迅速改变一穷二白的落后面貌，就领导我们高举总路线伟大红旗，实现了社会主义建设的大跃进，使我们的生活一天胜过一天。共产党是说到做到的。邓拓一伙骂党骂毛主席，说明他们与我们贫下中农是誓不两立的。共产党和毛主席是我们的贴心人，不管谁污蔑党和毛主席，我们都要同他斗到底。
    党和毛主席最爱护劳动人民教导我们自力更生改天换地
    南海县平洲公社石?大队大基生产队队长、学习毛主席著作积极分子左凤说：邓拓说什么历史上的统治阶级懂得爱护劳动力，诬蔑我们党“不爱护劳动力”，这真是颠倒黑白。过去地主骑在我们农民头上，叫死就死，叫生就生，我们有苦无处诉，他们这班吸血鬼，哪里讲什么“爱护劳动力”？我十一岁被迫去当奴婢，天天要给地主婆洗脚，搔背，摇扇，还要烧茶送水，从天没亮做到半夜，哪管我死活？地主、资本家把我们当牛当马使唤，只有共产党才真正爱护我们，几年时间，我们的生活提高不止十倍，家家户户三餐饭，有余粮，有余钱，茅寮变成了砖瓦房。所有这些都是毛主席、共产党给我们带来的！如果照邓拓的鬼主意去做，我们连粥都没得吃。我们国家如果不改变一穷二白的落后面貌，岂不是要我们的子孙后代永远受帝国主义、修正主义的欺负？
    东莞县茶山公社卢边大队贫农社员卢锡祥说：我们贫下中农迫切要求改变灾害面貌，党和毛主席最关心我们的根本利益，最爱护我们，教导我们不靠天，不靠地，要靠自力更生，艰苦奋斗的革命精神。我们茶山人民就是用毛泽东思想武装起来，靠自己双手劳动，靠集体经济力量，同天斗，同地斗，兴建了好多水利工程，把多灾多难的茶山改变成为水利电气化的新农村。过去我们大队三天不下雨，就要出动好多人，车九级水，车十三级水，不分昼夜抗旱，年年一样，现在我们不用这样辛苦了。邓拓诬蔑水利建设是“不爱护劳动力”，就是反对我们听毛主席的话，反对我们改造自然，妄想我们永远做灾害的奴隶，不得翻身。我们说，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，是闹翻身闹革命的法宝，邓拓越反对，我们越照毛主席的指示去做。
    南海县平洲公社平南大队副大队长郭伟珠说：解放前，国民党反动派和地主阶级是不顾我们死活的，我们这儿没有一点水利建设，大雨大灾，小雨小灾，常常睡到半夜水浸床头，我们终年到处漂流。解放以后，特别是大跃进以来，我们建成了水利网，无论水灾旱灾，我们都能保丰收。这是我们贫下中农的要求，这就是党对我们最大的爱护。邓拓黑帮胡说党“不爱护劳动力”，目的是挑拨我们同党的关系，不让我们大跃进，妄想我们贫下中农跟他们走资本主义复辟的黑路。我们贫下中农深深知道党最爱我们，我们也最爱党，我们永远要跟党走。
    社会主义家当雄厚得很十二级强台风也刮不倒
    番禺县万倾沙公社沙尾一大队民兵营长钟带根说：邓拓污蔑我们社会主义事业是“一个鸡蛋的家当”、“一拳头就把家当打得精光”，这是最恶毒的污蔑。邓拓，你听着：几亿劳动人民辛勤劳动创造出来的家当，岂容你“全部毁掉”！象我这样苦瓜一样出身的人，在旧社会被地主恶霸逼得无衣无食，父母兄弟姐妹死的死，走的走，根本没有什么“家”，更没有什么“当”。解放以后，党和毛主席领导我们搞土改，成立合作社，成立人民公社，才有了家，有了当，并且不是一家一户的家当，而是建立在集体经济基础上的社会主义的大家当。
    民立大队党支部书记陈耀林说：解放以前，我们这里地处珠江口，海堤单薄，一刮台风就崩堤，水冲田庄，加上地主的剥削和压迫，人亡家散。解放以后，特别是经过大跃进以来几年的艰苦奋斗，把一百多公里的海堤全部用大石头垒起来，基本实现了石堤化，洪水、台风、咸潮，都给抗住了。这样的家当，难道邓拓一个黑拳就可以打碎吗？不！我们的家当十二级强台风也刮不倒！
    东莞县茶山公社上元大队党支部书记蔡耀佳说：邓拓这个“三家村”黑店的掌柜，对社会主义这样刻骨仇恨，竟想把我们的社会主义铁江山推倒，实在太不自量。我们的社会主义家当正在天天巩固，天天发展。拿我们上元大队来说，现在建设起来的集体家当达一百万元以上，我们的家当大旱旱不倒，暴雨冲不垮。一九六三年，七个多月的大旱，我们不怕，仍然获得了大丰收。邓拓污蔑我们建设社会主义是“财迷”。在毛主席的教导下，我们工人农民懂得建设社会主义是为了革命，就是革贫穷落后的命，也革你们一切阶级敌人的命。我们还要为中国革命和世界革命做出更多的贡献，巩固我们的社会主义江山。
    东莞县茶山公社党委书记崔洪、上元大队党支部书记蔡耀佳说：毛泽东思想是百战百胜的锐利武器。有了毛泽东思想，我们取得了革命的胜利，取得了社会主义建设的辉煌成就，有了毛泽东思想，就可以保证我们的革命永不变色，就能够打垮一切阶级敌人的进攻。毛泽东思想光芒万丈，一切牛鬼蛇神，不管它怎么阴险、狡诈、隐蔽，只要用毛泽东思想一照，统统都要露出反动的真面目。邓拓一伙反对毛泽东思想，我们就要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得更高，彻底打垮“三家村”这伙黑帮。
