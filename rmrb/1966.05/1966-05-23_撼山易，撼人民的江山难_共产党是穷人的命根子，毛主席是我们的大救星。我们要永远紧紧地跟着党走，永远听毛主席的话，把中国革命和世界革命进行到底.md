    It is Easy to Move Mountains, But Hard to Shake the People's Country
    The Communist Party is the Lifeline of the Poor, and Chairman Mao is Our Great Savior. We Must Always Follow the Party Closely, Always Listen to Chairman Mao, and Carry the Chinese Revolution and the World Revolution Through to the End
    Sun Leyi, A Soldier of a Certain Unit of the Jinan Military Region
    In the past few days, with boundless anger, I have read the criminal materials of the Deng Tuo black gang against the Party and socialism, and have repeatedly studied the two editorials of the *Liberation Army Daily*. Faced with the current fierce class struggle, and reviewing Chairman Mao’s teachings on class and class struggle, I see more and more clearly that in the cultural front for more than ten years after the founding of the country, there has been a counter-Party and anti-socialist black line opposed to Mao Zedong Thought. What *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office*, *Evening Talks at Yanshan*, *Notes from Three-Family Village*, etc., are all poisonous arrows shot at our Party by class enemies. The "Three-Family Village" painstakingly run by Deng Tuo and his ilk is a branch opened in China by the joint anti-China company of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries. Although this black shop also hangs out a "red flag" signboard at the entrance, and the goods they sell are also labeled with "red" trademarks, as long as we tear off their masks, dismantle their signboards, and destroy their lairs, the reactionary words and deeds of Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and other monsters and demons will be nakedly exposed.
    Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and others are filial sons and virtuous grandsons of the landlord and bourgeois classes. They stubbornly stand on the reactionary positions of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, wearing the cloak of revolution, but actually engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. Moreover, they are becoming bolder and bolder, daring to blatantly attack our great Party, attack the socialist system, attack the dictatorship of the proletariat, and employ all kinds of base and shameless tricks to prevent us from following the Party on the road to socialism. Deng Tuo, you have miscalculated and are daydreaming. The Communist Party is the lifeline of the poor, and Chairman Mao is our great savior. We must always follow the Party closely, always listen to Chairman Mao, and carry the Chinese revolution and the world revolution through to the end. Your attempt to block our path and hold us back is a pipe dream. Let me tell you honestly, it is easy to move mountains, but hard to shake the People's Liberation Army and the people's country.
    Deng Tuo viciously smeared our Great Leap Forward as "bragging," and the socialist cause as "finished." Even a three-year-old child would not believe such nonsense. In the past two years, I have visited various parts of the motherland, and the brilliant achievements of the motherland's socialist construction are so exciting. Look at the heroic people of Daqing. Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, they overcame all kinds of difficulties under the harsh conditions of a vast blue sky and wild land, and took down this big oil field in just a few years, ending the era of Chinese people relying on foreign oil. Then look at the heroic people of Dazhai. Under the brilliant light of the General Line, relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants, fearing neither heaven nor earth, they fought against the poor mountains and bad waters, and turned a Dazhai with seven gullies, eight ridges, and one slope into a socialist granary. Today, how many Daqing-style and Dazhai-style advanced units have emerged in all parts of the motherland. On the scientific front, we have shattered the layers of blockades imposed by imperialism and modern revisionism, and successfully conducted three nuclear explosions. All of this is the brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese people have never held their heads so high as they do today. Deng Tuo, Wu Han, don't you often study history and claim to be "authorities" in history? I ask you, which dynasty in old China had such brilliant achievements? Is this bragging? There is a saying in our hometown: "A lazy dog cannot topple a mountain." The evil wind stirred up by you monsters and demons will never blow down the red flag of revolution.
    What kind of vine bears what kind of melon, and what class speaks what kind of words. It is not surprising that Deng Tuo and his ilk attack us so vigorously. Chairman Mao taught us that it is a good thing, not a bad thing, to be opposed by the enemy. The fact that Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Liao Mosha and others have been carrying out such rampant anti-Party and anti-socialist activities for several years, on the one hand, is due to their deep-seated hatred for the Party and the people, and on the other hand, it also shows that our work is being done very well, and they have strongly sensed that they are about to enter their graves, and they are making a desperate struggle. Deng Tuo and others have taken up poisonous guns, shot out hidden arrows, and launched a frenzied attack on our Party. As a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, I will resolutely take up my weapon and, together with the people of the whole country, fire at "Three-Family Village" and all the monsters and demons to defend the great Mao Zedong Thought and the interests of the Party and the people. I will bear in mind Chairman Mao's teachings, never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, and never forget to serve the people completely and thoroughly, and I will be a brave warrior on the battlefield with real guns and ammunition, and a hard bone of the proletariat on the political and ideological front.

    撼山易，撼人民的江山难
    共产党是穷人的命根子，毛主席是我们的大救星。我们要永远紧紧地跟着党走，永远听毛主席的话，把中国革命和世界革命进行到底
    济南军区某部　孙乐义
    这几天，我怀着无比愤怒的心情，阅读了邓拓黑帮的一些反党反社会主义罪恶材料，又反复地学习了《解放军报》的两篇社论。面对着当前激烈的阶级斗争，重温了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，我对建国后十几年来，在文化战线上，存在着一条与毛泽东思想相对立的反党反社会主义黑线，看得越来越清楚了。什么《海瑞罢官》、《燕山夜话》、《三家村札记》等等，都是阶级敌人向我们党射出的一支支毒箭。邓拓他们苦心经营的“三家村”，就是帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派联合反华公司在中国开设的一个分店。尽管这家黑店门口，也挂上“红旗”的幌子，他们销售的货品，也贴上了“红色”的商标，但是只要我们撕下他们的画皮，拆掉他们的招牌，捣毁他们的巢穴，邓拓、吴晗这些牛鬼蛇神的反动言行就赤裸裸地暴露出来了。
    邓拓、吴晗等是地主资产阶级的孝子贤孙，他们顽固地站在地富反坏右的反动立场上，披着革命的外衣，实际上干着反革命的勾当。而且，胆子越来越大，竟敢明目张胆地攻击我们伟大的党，攻击社会主义制度，攻击无产阶级专政，施展出各种卑鄙无耻的伎俩，不让我们跟着党走社会主义道路。邓拓，你们是打错了算盘，做错了梦。共产党是我们穷人的命根子，毛主席是我们的大救星。我们要永远紧紧地跟着党走，永远听毛主席的话，把中国革命和世界革命进行到底。你们妄想挡我们的道，扯我们的腿，那是白日作梦。老实告诉你们，撼山易，撼解放军和人民的江山难。
    邓拓恶毒地污蔑我们的大跃进是“吹牛皮”，社会主义事业“完蛋了”，这样的鬼话连三岁的小孩也不信。近两年，我曾到祖国各地进行过参观访问，祖国社会主义建设的辉煌成就，是那么激动人心。看看英雄的大庆人，他们高举着毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在上盖蓝天，下铺荒原的恶劣条件下，战胜了种种困难，仅用几年工夫，拿下这大油田，使中国人靠洋油过日子的时代一去不复返了。再看看英雄的大寨人，他们在总路线光辉照耀下，依靠贫下中农，天不怕，地不怕，和穷山恶水作斗争，把一个七沟八岭一面坡的大寨，变成了社会主义的粮囤子。今天，在祖国各地涌现了多少大庆式、大寨式先进单位。在科学战线上，我们粉碎了帝国主义、现代修正主义的层层封锁，成功地进行了三次核爆炸。所有这一切，都是毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。中国人民从来没有象今天这样扬眉吐气。邓拓、吴晗，你们不是经常研究历史，并以历史学家的“权威”自居吗？我问你们旧中国哪朝哪代有过这样的光辉成就？难道这是说大话，吹牛皮吗？我们家乡有句俗话：“懒狗叫不倒山岗”，你们这伙牛鬼蛇神所吹起的妖风，决不会刮倒革命的红旗。
    什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。邓拓这些家伙，这样起劲地攻击我们，一点也不奇怪。毛主席教导我们说，被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙几年来这么猖狂地进行反党反社会主义活动，一方面是由于他们对党和人民怀有刻骨仇恨，另一方面也说明了我们的工作做得很好，他们已经强烈地感觉到自己快要走进坟墓了，他们在作垂死的挣扎。邓拓等人拿起了毒枪，射出了暗箭，向我们党发起了猖狂的进攻，我，作为解放军的一个战士，坚决拿起武器，同全国人民一道，为捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想，为捍卫党和人民的利益，向“三家村”以及所有的牛鬼蛇神开火。我要牢记毛主席的教导，永远不忘阶级斗争，永远不忘无产阶级专政，永远不忘完全、彻底地为人民服务，既要在真枪实弹的战场上作冲锋陷阵的勇士，又要在政治思想战线上作无产阶级的硬骨头。
