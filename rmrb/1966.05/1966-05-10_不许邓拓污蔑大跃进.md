    No Slandering the Great Leap Forward by Deng Tuo Allowed
    Worker of Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, Chen Tiansheng
    After reading the materials exposing Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist black talk, we have clearly recognized Deng Tuo's ugly face. Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and their ilk, using their "status" and "authority," have for a long time carried out vicious attacks against our Party and our socialist system,妄想 hoping to restore capitalism. This is absolutely intolerable to us. We, the working class, are the masters of the country. In the current serious class struggle, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, charge forward, and resolutely strike down this black line!
    Deng Tuo slandered our Great Leap Forward as "bragging," "talking big," and "smashing heads and bleeding" in the face of facts, etc. We want to ask Deng Tuo: On what basis are you fabricating these words? We workers who personally participated in the Great Leap Forward, are we not clearer than you lot?!
    Taking our Heavy Machine Tool Plant as an example, we can proudly declare: Our plant is a product of the Great Leap Forward. According to the plan, our plant would not have been completed until 1960. However, the situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country encouraged all the staff and workers of the plant. Under the glorious illumination of the "General Line for socialist construction: going all out, aiming high and achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results," our plant was fully completed one and a half years ahead of schedule in 1958, and in the same year, we achieved excellent results with an annual output of more than two hundred heavy machine tools. The following year, our plant had an even greater leap forward, with output jumping from more than two hundred units per year to more than four hundred units per year. Moreover, in that year, we manufactured cutting-edge products – planing and milling combined machines. In the third year, our plant continued to achieve a great leap forward. These facts are unprecedented. Anyone who denies them will "smash their heads and bleed" in the face of the facts!

    不许邓拓污蔑大跃进
    武汉重型机床厂工人　陈天升
    看了揭露邓拓的反党反社会主义黑话的材料，我们认清了邓拓的丑恶嘴脸。邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙之流，利用自己的“地位”“职权”，长期以来，对我们党、对我们的社会主义制度进行恶毒的攻击，妄想使资本主义复辟，这是我们绝对不能容许的。我们工人阶级是国家的主人，在当前这场严重的阶级斗争中，要高举毛泽东思想红旗，冲锋陷阵，坚决反掉这条黑线！
    邓拓诬蔑我们的大跃进是“吹牛皮”“说大话”，在事实面前“碰得头破血流”，等等。我们要问邓拓：你凭什么胡诌这些话？我们亲自参加了大跃进的工人，难道还不比你们这一撮人清楚吗？！
    就拿我们重型机床厂来说，完全可以自豪地宣称：我们厂就是大跃进的产物。按计划，我们厂得在一九六○年才能建成，可是全国大跃进的形势鼓舞着全厂职工，在党提出的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线”光辉照耀下，我们厂于一九五八年提前一年半就全面建成了，并且当年就取得了年产二百多台重大型机床的优异成绩。第二年我厂又来了个更大的跃进，产量从年产二百多台一跃为年产四百多台，而且就在那一年，我们制造出了尖端产品——刨铣联合机。第三年我厂继续获得了大跃进。这些事实是史无前例的，谁否认，就让谁在事实面前“碰得头破血流”！
