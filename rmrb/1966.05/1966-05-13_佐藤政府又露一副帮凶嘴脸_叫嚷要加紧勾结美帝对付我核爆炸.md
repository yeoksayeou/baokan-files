　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th dispatch: The main accomplice of US imperialism in Asia, the Japanese Sato government, viciously attacked China's third nuclear test, clamoring to further collude with US imperialism and formulate so-called "countermeasures."

　　According to Kyodo News, the Japanese government specially convened a cabinet meeting on the 10th because of China's successful nuclear explosion. Eisaku Sato, who has repeatedly brought US nuclear submarines into Japan, endangering the safety of the Japanese people, put on a hypocritical posture of caring about the safety of the Japanese people and delivered a vicious anti-China speech at the meeting, saying that China's nuclear test made Japan "face the danger of radioactive dust pollution, so I hope the relevant government departments will quickly conduct observation and investigation to prevent the occurrence of danger." The Japanese government also pretentiously stated that it would set up a "countermeasures headquarters" in the cabinet when necessary.

　　When answering inquiries at the Foreign Affairs Committee meeting of the House of Councillors on the 10th, Japanese Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina, while trying his best to belittle the significance of China's successful third nuclear test, said that this nuclear test had brought "unease and turmoil" to Asian countries. He also expressed his intention to adhere to the current Japan-US "Security Treaty" system, which is hostile to China.

　　Japanese "Defense Agency" Director-General Raizo Matsuno attacked China's nuclear test at a press conference held after the cabinet meeting on the 10th, openly expressing his intention to adhere to the so-called Japan-US "Security" Treaty system and formulate "appropriate" military countermeasures.

　　On the morning of the 10th, the Sato government also issued a statement by Cabinet Chief Secretary Tomisaburo Hashimoto, expressing so-called "protest" against China's nuclear explosion. The cabinet meeting agreed to this statement. In this statement, Tomisaburo Hashimoto wantonly asked China to "conduct deep reflection," clamoring to "suggest that China actively participate" in the Moscow Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

　　Kakuei Tanaka, Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, the ruling party of Japan, also issued a statement on the 10th, attacking China's nuclear test as "intolerable," while praising the Soviet Union for changing its previous policy and "embarking on the road of peaceful coexistence."

    佐藤政府又露一副帮凶嘴脸
    叫嚷要加紧勾结美帝对付我核爆炸
    新华社十二日讯　东京消息：美帝国主义在亚洲的主要帮凶日本佐藤政府恶毒攻击中国第三次核试验，扬言要进一步同美帝国主义勾结，制订所谓“对策”。
    据共同社报道，日本政府十日特地为中国的核爆炸成功召开了一次内阁会议。曾经把美国核潜艇多次引进日本、危害日本人民安全的佐藤荣作，装出了关心日本人民安全的虚伪姿态，在会议上发表恶毒反华讲话，说什么中国的核试验使日本“存在着放射性尘埃污染的危险，所以希望政府的有关机关迅速地进行观测调查，致力于防止危险发生”。日本政府还煞有介事地表示在必要时在内阁设立“对策总部”。
    日本外务相椎名悦三郎十日在参议院外务委员会会议上答复质询时，一面极力贬低中国第三次核试验成功的意义，一面说什么这次核试验给亚洲各国“带来不安和动摇”。他并且表示要坚持现行的敌视中国的日美“安全条约”体制。
    日本“防卫厅”长官松野赖三在十日的内阁会议后举行的记者招待会上，攻击中国的核试验，公开表示要坚持所谓日美“安全”条约体制，制订“适当的”军事对策。
    佐藤政府十日上午还发表了内阁官房长官（秘书长）桥本登美三郎的谈话，对中国的核爆炸表示所谓“抗议”。内阁会议同意了这次谈话。桥本登美三郎在这次谈话中放肆地要中国“进行深刻的反省”，叫嚷什么“建议中国主动地参加”莫斯科部分禁止核试验条约。
    日本执政党自由民主党干事长田中角荣十日也发表谈话，攻击中国的核试验是“不能容忍的”，同时赞扬苏联改变了以往的政策，“走上和平共处的道路”。
