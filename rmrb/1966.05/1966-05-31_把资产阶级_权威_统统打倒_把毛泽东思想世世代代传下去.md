    Editor's Note: Since the *Liberation Army Daily* and *Guangming Daily* re-published the articles written by table tennis player Comrade Zhuang Jiafu and Zhou Xinli, manager of the Zhabei District Company of the Shanghai Fruit and Sundries Company, along with the editor's note, exposing the ugly face of certain "authorities" who viciously attacked and suppressed workers, peasants, and soldiers in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, it has aroused the indignation of the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals. They clearly recognize that this is another poisoned arrow released by bourgeois representatives who have wormed their way into the Party, opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, using their own personal experiences and ironclad facts, severely refuted the anti-Party fallacies of certain "authorities," exposed their sinister intentions, and dragged them into the broad daylight.
    Regarding the great event of workers, peasants, and soldiers creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, which is related to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, some say "it's excellent," while others say "it's terrible." This vividly reflects the two fundamentally different stances of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The article written by Comrades Li Suwen and Shen Sujuan, published in this newspaper today, is completely correct: "If the enemy does not rise up to oppose workers, peasants, and soldiers creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, then it means we have not studied well, and our study has not had any effect. If the enemy rises up to oppose it, it means we are studying correctly, studying well, and our study has had an effect. The more fiercely the enemy opposes us, the more it proves that we are studying better, and the greater the effect of our study." The more the enemy opposes our studying Mao Zedong Thought, the more we must study Mao Zedong Thought better, the more we must regard Chairman Mao's books as the supreme directives for all our work, and the more we must hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher.
    The upsurge in studying Chairman Mao's works has opened up a new era in which the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers directly grasp theory. This is an event of great historical significance in the history of the development of Marxism. This mass movement of workers, peasants, and soldiers consciously studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is fiercely impacting the monopolistic position of bourgeois representatives in the ideological field with the force of a thunderbolt, greatly shaking the thrones they have always occupied. All kinds of bourgeois representatives are extremely hostile and afraid of Mao Zedong Thought, and extremely hostile and afraid of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Those so-called "authorities" representing the bourgeoisie, impatiently and with the attitude of aristocratic masters, vehemently criticize workers, peasants, and soldiers creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as "simplification," "vulgarization," and "pragmatism," and oppose the principles of "studying with problems in mind, creatively studying and applying, combining study with application, studying what is urgently needed first, and seeing immediate results." This is a serious class struggle.
    How to treat workers, peasants, and soldiers creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is a touchstone for whether one truly supports Mao Zedong Thought or falsely supports Mao Zedong Thought, whether one truly supports the Party or falsely supports the Party, whether one is a true Marxist or a false Marxist, in a word, whether one is revolutionary or counter-revolutionary. Certain "authorities" use "simplification," "vulgarization," and "pragmatism" to attack workers, peasants, and soldiers creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. This is to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, to oppose the integration of Mao Zedong Thought with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to oppose the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction. Their purpose is to promote their revisionist set and prepare public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.
    Comrade Mao Zedong has ingeniously, creatively, and comprehensively developed Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth applicable everywhere, the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, and the highest and most vibrant Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful weapon for defeating imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries, and it is also a powerful weapon for us to oppose bourgeois "authorities." In the current great socialist cultural revolution, we must hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, highly promote the revolutionary spirit of communism, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to break through, dare to revolt, thoroughly criticize the bourgeoisie, open fire on all bourgeois "authorities," resolutely overthrow those anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois representatives, completely seize the leadership of all cultural fronts, and never stop until we achieve our goal.

    Thoroughly Overthrow the Bourgeois "Authorities" and Pass on Mao Zedong Thought for Generations to Come
    Li Suwen, Deputy Political Instructor of the Heping Non-Staple Food Store in Shenyang City, Delegate to the National People's Congress
    Shen Sujuan, Salesperson of the Shoe and Hat Store of the Shenyang Department Store Company

    We were very happy when we read the article written by Comrade Zhuang Jiafu, *Using Mao Zedong Thought to Arm Our Minds,* and the article written by Comrade Zhou Xinli, *Talking About the Philosophy of Selling Watermelons in Big Cities,* in the newspaper. From these two articles, it can be seen that they have worked hard to study Chairman Mao's works, have a deep understanding of Chairman Mao's philosophical thought, apply it creatively, and have achieved great results. They are lively, practical, and easy to understand, unlike the articles written by certain "scholars" and "authorities," which are either sour and dry or incomprehensible.
    Chairman Mao said: "We must be able to master and apply the theory of Marxism, and the purpose of mastering it lies entirely in applying it. If you can apply the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism to explain one or two practical problems, then you should be praised, and you will have achieved some success. The more things you explain, the more widespread and profound they are, the greater your achievements will be." These two comrades are precisely studying and applying according to Chairman Mao's teachings.
    What is infuriating is that certain "authorities" actually criticized these two articles as typical examples of "vulgarization" and "pragmatism." We believe that we must not let these two sentences go unpunished. There are not many words, but the toxicity is great. It tells us that there are two fundamentally different positions and attitudes towards the study of Chairman Mao's works by workers, peasants, and soldiers, which in reality also reflect two fundamentally different positions and attitudes towards Mao Zedong Thought. Their spearhead is by no means only aimed at these two articles, but viciously attacks the great Mao Zedong Thought and vigorously opposes workers, peasants, and soldiers creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.
    It is not surprising that some people say good things and others say bad things about the same thing. As early as more than thirty years ago, Chairman Mao said in *Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan*: "The peasants are rebelling in the villages, smashing the privileges of the feudal landlords for thousands of years." The broad masses of peasants organized themselves, established peasant associations, and took power. Everyone said, "It's excellent," while the gentry and the right wing of the Kuomintang said, "It's terrible." The broad masses of the people said, "It's excellent," and the achievements were great for the general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes; while the Deng Tuo gang attacked us as: "Speaking big words," "bragging," and "bumping our heads and bleeding." Of course, such a major event in human history as the study of Chairman Mao's works by the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, who have mastered the theoretical weapon, cannot but encounter the stubborn resistance of the reactionary class.
    Truth develops in struggle, and the theoretical ranks of workers, peasants, and soldiers also grow and strengthen in struggle. Workers, peasants, and soldiers, having studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, can use it to guide their own practice and continuously summarize their practical experience, write good articles, and enrich revolutionary theory. In this way, the era in which knowledge was monopolized by a very small number of intellectuals, "experts," and "authorities" for thousands of years is gone forever. Some people who live solely on books and regard "knowledge" and "learning" as talismans, whether they are "experts" or "authorities," can no longer scare people with knowledge from books, can no longer arbitrarily use ancient things to criticize the present, or carry out counter-revolutionary activities under the guise of academic issues. The masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers use Chairman Mao's viewpoint of class struggle and the "one divides into two" method to observe social phenomena, and no matter how cleverly the demons and monsters are disguised, they cannot be hidden. Isn't this precisely the case? Deng Tuo wormed his way into the internal organs of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and opened a "Three-Family Village" black shop, formed a gang, and spoke black language. Isn't he now being dragged out by us, and are we not going to dig out their old roots? Bourgeois "authorities" who have wormed their way into other departments and become "leading cadres" will certainly not escape the fate of Deng Tuo.
    Chairman Mao said: "It is not a bad thing to be opposed by the enemy. It is a bad thing if the enemy is not opposed. It proves that we are in league with the enemy. But it is a good thing to be opposed by the enemy, because it proves that we have drawn a clear line of demarcation between ourselves and the enemy. It is an even better thing if the enemy opposes us vigorously and paints us as utterly worthless, because it proves that we have not only drawn a clear line of demarcation between ourselves and the enemy, but that our work is very successful." If the enemy does not rise up to oppose workers, peasants, and soldiers creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, then it means we have not studied well, and our study has not had any effect. If the enemy rises up to oppose it, it means we are studying correctly, studying well, and our study has had an effect. The more fiercely the enemy opposes us, the more it proves that we are studying better, and the greater the effect of our study. By studying Chairman Mao's works, grasping the class viewpoint and the materialistic dialectical method, we have a pair of discerning eyes for observing everything around us. No matter what demons and monsters are, we can see them clearly, and no matter how many tricks they play, they can be exposed by us.
    We believe that the fundamental reason why those so-called "authorities" and "experts" scold workers, peasants, and soldiers for studying Chairman Mao's works and writing philosophical papers as "vulgarization" and "pragmatism," and attempt to undermine the movement of workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works, lies here.
    In our opinion, those who scold workers, peasants, and soldiers for creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and writing theoretical articles as "vulgarization" and "pragmatism" are themselves the true vulgarizers and the true pragmatists. These people stand on the bourgeois position, without the feelings of the proletariat, but with the feelings of the bourgeoisie. They have no experience in the three great revolutionary movements, but they have experience in opposing the Party and opposing socialism. Their habits and preferences are: sitting in the office, nitpicking words, clinging to books, putting on airs, glaring, and scaring people. The theoretical articles of workers, peasants, and soldiers, which are born from the actual revolutionary struggle and filled with proletarian feelings and dialectics, when they reach these people's eyes, they either cannot understand them, or they feel very uncomfortable in their hearts. Their reactionary class nature determines that they will step forward to oppose them. Thus, one "big hat" after another, such as workers', peasants', and soldiers' articles are "vulgarization," "simplification," and "pragmatism," is thrown out. We say that these scolding bourgeois aristocratic masters are scared to death when they see the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works with great eagerness, and the tremendous power generated by the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering Mao Zedong Thought. This is also determined by their reactionary class stand.
    We want to ask: Is it the articles that workers, peasants, and soldiers have summed up through the practice of struggle under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and that serve practice, that are "vulgarization" and "pragmatism," or are it your so-called "authorities" sitting in the room, moving words and ink, fabricating nonsense, and using it to scare people, that are vulgarization and pragmatism? The answer is very clear.
    Certain "authorities" scolding workers, peasants, and soldiers for studying Chairman Mao's works and writing theoretical articles as "vulgarization" and "pragmatism" can only prove how much those who stand on the reactionary position hate Mao Zedong Thought and how ignorant and ignorant they are. Why can workers, peasants, and soldiers study Chairman Mao's works so quickly and apply them so well? Because the core of Mao Zedong Thought is the theory of class struggle, it comes from revolutionary practice, and it is because Chairman Mao's book is a book for the poor to seek liberation, turn over, and protect the country. Taking the two of us as an example, we have only attended elementary school and have a very low level of education. However, what Chairman Mao's works say is every word in our hearts, and every word speaks to our hearts. When we read Chairman Mao's books, our hearts turn red, our eyes are bright, our bones are hard, our courage is strong, and we have many methods, and we can withstand any difficulties. It is precisely by creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works that we have come to understand how to be a proletarian revolutionary and how we should spend our revolutionary lives. The deeper and more thoroughly we understand Chairman Mao's thought, the clearer and more accurate we see the things around us.
    We want to tell certain "authorities" that the determination of workers, peasants, and soldiers to master theory is unswerving. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought were able to overthrow the US-Chiang reactionaries in the past, establish a new China, seize the seal of power, and become the masters of the new society; and now they are fully able to overthrow the so-called "experts," "scholars," and "authorities" who are anti-Party and anti-socialist, and become the main force in the socialist cultural revolution!
    Talking about writing articles, there is nothing great about it. Good articles can only be a summary of actual struggle experience, not copied from books. Without the conscious participation of the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the practice of the three great revolutionary movements, and without the continuous practice of workers in all walks of life and the continuous summing up of experience, how can there be any good articles? Since we can understand and learn Chairman Mao's works well, and personally participate in the revolutionary practice of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, we will definitely be able to write good articles. As for you so-called "experts," "authorities," and "scholars," who eat the food of workers, peasants, and soldiers, engage in counter-revolutionary activities, and lock yourselves in the room to put together some old tunes with "antique" and "foreign" accents, what you write are all anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds. We must resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely sweep these poisonous weeds into the latrine.
    The gang in the "Three-Family Village" black shop, such as Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha, who have been dragged out in the current socialist cultural revolution, as well as Xia Yan, Tian Han, Meng Chao... these people cannot be said to have read little, but because they stand on the reactionary class position, wear cadres' clothing on the outside and a "Communist Party member" sign, what is in their heads is nothing but capitalist thought or the thought of the feudal landlord class. What use is what they read to the Party and to socialism? If it is useful, it is only to be used as capital to oppose the Party and oppose socialism, and it plays the role of a negative teacher to the people. For decades, some of these people have written books, some have written movie scripts, and some have written plays. However, because they are completely written from the standpoint of the bourgeoisie and the feudal landlord class, the more they write, the greater the harm to the masses of the people. Since liberation, they have written so many bad books, written so many bad movie scripts, and written so many bad plays, and they still think they are great, calling themselves "experts," "scholars," and "authorities." In fact, what they release are all colorful sugar-coated bullets, all corrosive agents filled with toxins. Therefore, we must strip off the coats of "experts," "scholars," and "authorities" they wear, expose their painted skins, and let them appear in their original forms under the sun.
    Certain "authorities" scolding our workers, peasants, and soldiers for creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as "vulgarization" and "pragmatism" even more importantly exposes that they are viciously opposed to Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most vibrant Marxism-Leninism, and the universal truth proven by the practice of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Not only the Chinese people are studying it, but the revolutionary people of all countries in the world are also studying it. The revolutionary people of the whole world yearn for Mao Zedong Thought. Precisely because Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth, from the day it was born, there have been people desperately opposing it. Right-leaning opportunist Chen Duxiu opposed it, "Left"-leaning opportunist Wang Ming opposed it, and the current Khrushchev revisionists are also trying their best to oppose it. A small handful of bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities" oppose Mao Zedong Thought, but they have only learned it from their "teachers" who have already withdrawn from the historical stage. The outcome of the "student" will certainly not be better than that of his "teacher." On the contrary, they will fail faster and more miserably.
    History proves that the truth will never be overthrown. What can be overthrown is not the truth. How can one or a few black hands cover the radiant sun! Poisonous weeds can fertilize the fields. The scolding of bourgeois "authorities" and "scholars" can also inspire us from the opposite side to better creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and at the same time strive to write more articles that combine theory with practice. The more the bourgeois "authorities" oppose Mao Zedong Thought, the more we must hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and more firmly listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Because we clearly know that Mao Zedong Thought is not only the sharpest weapon against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, but also the sharp weapon against bourgeois "authorities." As long as we firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought and pass on the great Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation, we will completely eliminate all the demons and monsters on the earth.

### 把资产阶级“权威”统统打倒  把毛泽东思想世世代代传下去
李素文  沈素娟
1966-05-31
第1版()
专栏：

    编者按：自从《解放军报》《光明日报》重新发表了乒乓球运动员庄家富同志和上海市果品杂货公司闸北区公司经理周信礼同志写的文章及编者按语，揭穿了某些“权威”恶毒地攻击和压制工农兵活学活用毛主席著作的丑恶面目以后，激起了广大工农兵、革命干部和革命知识分子的义愤。他们清楚地认识到：这是钻进党内的资产阶级代表人物放出的反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的又一支毒箭。广大工农兵用自己的切身体验和铁的事实，严厉驳斥了某些“权威”的反党谬论，戳穿了他们的险恶用心，把他们拉到了光天化日之下。
    对待工农兵活学活用毛主席著作这样一件关系到中国革命和世界革命的大事，有人说“好得很”，有人说“糟得很”，这里鲜明地反映了无产阶级和资产阶级的两种根本不同的立场。今天本报刊载的李素文、沈素娟两位同志合写的文章，说得完全正确：“工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，如果敌人不起来反对，那就说明我们没有学好，学了没有起作用。敌人起来反对，说明我们学的对，学的好，起了作用。敌人反对的越厉害，证明我们学习的越好，起的作用越大。”敌人越是反对我们学习毛主席著作，我们就越要更好地学习毛主席著作，我们就越要把毛主席的书当作各项工作的最高指示，我们就越要把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗举得更高。
    学习毛主席著作的高潮，开辟了广大工农兵直接掌握理论的新时代。这是马克思主义发展史上具有伟大历史意义的事件。这个工农兵自觉地学习和掌握毛泽东思想的群众运动，正以雷霆万钧之势，猛烈地冲击着资产阶级代表人物在意识形态领域中的垄断地位，大大地动摇了他们一直盘踞着的宝座。形形色色的资产阶级代表人物，十分仇视和害怕毛泽东思想，十分仇视和害怕广大工农兵活学活用毛主席著作。那些代表资产阶级的所谓“权威”迫不及待地以贵族老爷的态度，大骂工农兵活学活用毛主席著作是“简单化”、“庸俗化”和“实用主义”，反对“带着问题学、活学活用、学用结合、急用先学、立竿见影”的原则。这是一场严重的阶级斗争。
    如何对待工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，是真拥护毛泽东思想还是假拥护毛泽东思想，真拥护党还是假拥护党，真马克思主义者还是假马克思主义者，一句话，是革命还是反革命的试金石。某些“权威”用什么“简单化”、“庸俗化”、“实用主义”来攻击工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，就是反对毛泽东思想，就是反对毛泽东思想同广大工农兵群众相结合，反对马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合，其目的是推行他们的修正主义的一套，为资本主义复辟作舆论准备。
    毛泽东同志天才地创造性地全面地发展了马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是战胜帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的强大武器，也是我们反对资产阶级“权威”的强大武器。在目前正在展开的伟大的社会主义文化大革命中，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，高度发扬共产主义的革命精神，敢想，敢说，敢闯，敢革命，彻底批判资产阶级，向一切资产阶级“权威”开火，坚决打倒那些反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物，把一切文化阵地的领导权完全夺取过来，不达目的，决不罢休。

    我们在报纸上看到庄家富同志写的《用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑》和周信礼同志写的《谈谈大城市卖西瓜的哲学问题》，心里很高兴。从这两篇文章中，可以看出：他们努力学习毛主席著作，对毛主席的哲学思想理解的深，用的活，收效大。读起来生动、实际、好懂，不象某些“学者”、“权威”写的文章那样，不是酸溜溜的、干巴巴的，就是叫人看不懂。
    毛主席说：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。如果你能应用马克思列宁主义的观点，说明一个两个实际问题，那就要受到称赞，就算有了几分成绩。被你说明的东西越多，越普遍，越深刻，你的成绩就越大。”这两位同志正是按照毛主席的教导去学习，去运用的。
    叫人气愤的是，某些“权威”竟骂这两篇文章是“庸俗化”和“实用主义”的典型。我们认为决不能放过这两句话。话不多，毒气大。它告诉了我们：对于工农兵学习毛主席著作这件事，有着两种根本不同的立场和态度，实际上也是反映了对毛泽东思想的两种根本不同的立场和态度。他们的矛头绝不只是对着这两篇文章，而是恶毒地攻击伟大的毛泽东思想，极力地反对工农兵活学活用毛主席著作。
    对同一件事，有人说好，有人说坏，这并不奇怪。早在三十多年前，毛主席在《湖南农民运动考察报告》中说过：农民在乡里造反，把几千年封建地主的特权，打得个落花流水。广大农民组织起来，成立了农民协会，掌握了权力，人人都说“好得很”，而乡绅们和国民党右派，却说“糟得很”。对社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社，广大人民群众都说：“好得很”，成绩很大；而邓拓一伙黑帮却攻击我们是：“说大话”，“吹牛皮”，“碰得头破血流”。对于工农兵群众学习毛主席著作，掌握了理论武器这样一件人类历史上从来没有过的大事，当然不能不遇到反动阶级的顽强抵抗。
    真理是在斗争中发展的，工农兵的理论队伍也是在斗争中发展壮大起来的。工农兵学习运用了毛泽东思想，既能用来指导自己的实践，又能不断总结自己的实践经验，写出好文章，丰富革命的理论。这样一来，几千年来由极少数知识分子“专家”、“权威”垄断知识的时代就一去不复返了。一些专从书本上讨生活、把“知识”、“学问”当作护身符的人，不管是“专家”还是“权威”，再也不能拿书上的知识吓唬人了，再也不能任意地引古非今，借古骂今，或者是打着学术问题的幌子干着反革命的勾当了。工农兵群众运用毛主席的阶级斗争观点、“一分为二”的方法来观察社会现象，牛鬼蛇神伪装的再巧也都隐藏不住了。事实不正是这样吗？邓拓钻进了中共北京市委会内部开了个“三家村”黑店，结成黑帮，讲着黑话，现在不是已经被我们揪出来，并且要把它们的老根挖出来吗？钻进了其他部门、当上了“领导干部”的资产阶级“权威”，也决逃脱不了邓拓这样的命运。
    毛主席说：“一个人，一个党，一个军队，或者一个学校，如若不被敌人反对，那就不好了，那一定是同敌人同流合污了。如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。如果敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，如果敌人不起来反对，那就说明我们没有学好，学了没有起作用。敌人起来反对，说明我们学的对，学的好，起了作用。敌人反对的越厉害，证明我们学习的越好，起的作用越大。我们学习毛主席著作，掌握了阶级观点和唯物辩证的方法，对于观察周围的一切事物，就有了一双慧眼，无论什么妖魔鬼怪，都能看得清，无论他耍出多少花招，都能被我们揭穿。
    我们认为那些所谓“权威”、“专家”，谩骂工农兵学习毛主席著作、写的哲学论文是什么“庸俗化”、“实用主义”，妄想破坏工农兵学习毛主席著作的运动，根本原因就在这里。
    在我们看来，骂工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，写出理论文章是“庸俗化”、“实用主义”的人，他们自己才是真正的庸俗化、真正的实用主义。这些人站在资产阶级立场上，丝毫没有无产阶级的感情，有的是资产阶级的感情。他们没有参加三大革命运动的经验，却有反党反社会主义的经验，他们的习惯和喜好是：坐在办公室里咬文嚼字，抠书本，拉架子，瞪眼睛，吓唬人。从革命的实际斗争中产生出来的、充满了无产阶级感情和辩证法的工农兵理论文章，到了这些人的眼里，他们要不就是看不懂，要不就是看了心里十分不舒服。反动的阶级本性决定着他们，要加劲地站出来反对。于是什么工农兵的文章是“庸俗化”啦，“简单化”啦，“实用主义”啦，“大帽子”一个又一个地抛了出来。我们说，这些骂人的资产阶级贵族老爷们，看到工农兵群众如饥如渴地学习毛主席著作，以及工农兵群众掌握了毛泽东思想所产生的巨大的力量，他们怕得要死。这也是为他们的反动的阶级立场所决定的。
    我们要问：究竟是工农兵在毛泽东思想指导下，通过斗争实践，总结出来的经验，又服务于实践的文章是“庸俗化”，“实用主义”的呢，还是你们那些所谓“权威”坐在屋子里搬文弄墨、胡乱编造，借以唬人的八股文章是庸俗化和实用主义的呢？答案是十分清楚的。
    某些“权威”骂工农兵学习毛主席著作、写理论文章是“庸俗化”、“实用主义”，只能证明那些站在反动立场的人是多么仇视毛泽东思想，多么愚蠢无知。工农兵学习毛主席著作，为什么能学的快，用的好呢？因为毛泽东思想的核心是阶级斗争的学说，是从革命实践中来的，是因为毛主席的书，是穷人求解放、闹翻身、保江山的书。拿我们两个人来说，都只念过小学，文化水平很低。但是毛主席著作里讲的，句句都是我们心里的话，句句都说到了我们的心坎上。我们读了毛主席的书，就心红眼亮，骨头硬，胆子壮，办法多，什么困难也顶得住。正是活学活用毛主席著作，我们才懂得了怎样做一个无产阶级革命者，应该怎样度过革命的一生。我们对毛主席的思想领会的越深越透，对周围的事情也就看的越清越准。
    我们要告诉某些“权威”，工农兵掌握理论的决心是坚定不移的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大工农兵群众，过去能够打倒美蒋反动派，建立了新中国，掌握印把子，成为新社会的主人；现在也完全能够打倒反党反社会主义的所谓“专家”、“学者”、“权威”，当社会主义文化大革命的主力军！
    谈到写文章，也没啥了不起。好文章都只能是实际斗争经验的总结，而不是从书本上抄来的。没有工农兵群众自觉地参加三大革命运动的实践，没有各行各业劳动者的不断实践，不断总结经验，那会有什么好文章呢？我们既然能够学懂学好毛主席著作，又亲自参加阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的革命实践，就一定能够写出好文章来。至于你们这些所谓“专家”、“权威”、“学者”，吃了工农兵的饭，干着反革命的勾当，关在屋子里用“古董”、“洋腔”拼凑一些老鸦调，写的都是反党反社会主义的毒草。我们要坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把这些毒草扫到茅厕里去。
    当前社会主义文化大革命中揪出的什么邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙等“三家村”黑店中的一伙，还有什么夏衍、田汉、孟超……这些人读书不能说不多，但是，因为他们站在反动的阶级立场上，外表穿着干部的服装，挂着“共产党员”的牌子，而脑袋里装的除了资本主义思想，就是封建地主阶级的思想。他们读的书对党对社会主义有什么用呢？如果说有用，就是用来作为反党反社会主义的本钱，对人民起了反面教员的作用。几十年来，这些人有的著书，有的写电影剧本，有的编戏。但是，由于他们完全是站在资产阶级和封建地主阶级的立场上写的，因此写的越多，对人民群众的毒害就越大。解放以来，他们写了那么些坏书，编了那么些坏电影剧本，写了那么些坏戏，还觉得了不起，自封为什么“专家”、“学者”、“权威”，其实，他们放出来的都是五颜六色的糖衣炮弹，都是充满了毒素的腐蚀剂。因此，我们必须扒下他们穿的“专家”、“学者”、“权威”的外衣，戳穿他们的画皮，让他们站在太阳底下现出原形。
    某些“权威”骂我们工农兵活学活用毛主席著作的文章是“庸俗化”、“实用主义”，更重要的是暴露了他们是恶毒地反对毛泽东思想的。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是中国革命和世界革命的实践证明了的普遍真理。不仅中国人民在学，世界各国的革命人民也在学，全世界革命人民都向往毛泽东思想。正因为毛泽东思想是普遍真理，从它诞生的那一天起，就有人拼命地反对它。右倾机会主义者陈独秀反对过它，“左”倾机会主义者王明反对过它，现在的赫鲁晓夫修正主义者也极力反对它。一小撮资产阶级“学者”、“权威”反对毛泽东思想，只不过是从它们已经退出历史舞台的“老师”们那里学来的罢了。“学生”的下场，肯定不会比它的“老师”好一点。相反，会失败的更快，更惨。
    历史证明，真理是永远反不倒的。能被反倒的就不是真理。一只或几只黑手怎能遮住光芒万丈的太阳！毒草可以肥田。资产阶级“权威”、“学者”的责骂，也正可以从反面激励我们更好地活学活用毛主席著作，同时努力写出更多的理论联系实际的文章。资产阶级“权威”越是反对毛泽东思想，我们越是要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更加坚定不移地听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。因为我们清楚地知道：毛泽东思想不仅是反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的最尖锐的武器，也是反对资产阶级“权威”的尖锐武器。只要我们紧紧掌握毛泽东思想，并且把伟大的毛泽东思想世世代代传下去，就会把地球上的一切牛鬼蛇神彻底铲除掉。
