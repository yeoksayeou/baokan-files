    Resolutely Repel the Offensive of Demons and Monsters
             Wei Helin, Veteran Worker of "Gate No. 6" at Tianjin Station
    I am a veteran worker at "Gate No. 6" of Tianjin Station under the Beijing Railway Bureau. I feel extremely indignant at Wu Han's malicious slander of our working people and his frantic attacks on the Party and socialism. We must resolutely fight back.

    In 1946, Wu Han slandered the revolutionary war led by our Party as "the two parties are deadlocked, the people suffer, and resentment towards the people will not bring any good." After liberation, he again criticized our many history textbooks for "emphasizing peasant uprisings and peasant wars," causing "the bright side of history to be lost," making the history of the motherland "a dark and gloomy mess." This fully exposes his attitude of hatred towards the revolution.

    Chairman Mao taught us: "In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable, and without them, the leap in social development cannot be completed, the reactionary ruling class cannot be overthrown, and the people cannot gain political power." He also said: "Class struggle, some classes triumph, some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is the history of civilization for thousands of years." We can see that what Wu Han said is completely a counter-revolutionary tune.

    Why do we fight against the reactionary ruling class? Why do we make revolution? Because the reactionary ruling class oppresses us, exploits us. Without struggle, without revolution, we cannot be liberated. Take "Gate No. 6" for example. Before liberation, the feudal headmen and bureaucratic capitalists exploited us workers to the point of sucking our marrow. The loading and unloading fees earned by the workers every day were taken away by the headmen by 80 to 90 percent, and the workers' daily wages could only buy two catties of mixed flour. Under cruel exploitation, the workers were not fed enough and were not warmly clothed, struggling all day long on the line of starvation and death. At that time, because I was too hungry to bear it, I picked up a handful of sugar scattered on the ground. The headman's lackey saw it and sent me to the police section to be electrocuted and poured cold water on, torturing me for more than a month, almost killing me. Worker Wang Bo was beaten to death by the headman and the Japanese devils for eating a mouthful of raw noodles. Freezing to death, starving to death, and selling sons and daughters happened frequently. The feudal headmen not only cruelly exploited the workers economically, but also colluded with imperialism and the reactionary government. They kept thugs and colluded with secret agents to cruelly rule and suppress the workers, vainly hoping to make the workers their beasts of burden forever, letting them be slaughtered. Before liberation, these words were circulated among the workers: "If you want to eat the porter's rice, you have to trade your life for it." "Sleeping on the ground, covered by the sky, with half a brick as a pillow." Under such cruel exploitation and oppression, the workers could not survive without struggle and revolution. In order to turn ourselves over, in order to liberate ourselves, we organized ourselves under the leadership of the Party, persisted in struggle, and the headmen frantically shouted that it would not be peaceful if a few heads were not hung on Gate No. 6. Look, class struggle is so sharp! Can we let the class enemies slaughter us?

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the national revolution triumphed in 1949. The workers of "Gate No. 6" overthrew the rule of the feudal headmen and became the masters of the freight yard. But the porter headmen were not reconciled to defeat. They used various means to sabotage socialist construction, vainly attempting to restore capitalism. Under the leadership of the Party, we repelled their attacks again and again. We personally experienced that class struggle cannot be forgotten, and revolution cannot be stopped. For our vast working people, class struggle is the bright side of history. The history of the proletariat is precisely to expose the criminal rule of the reactionary ruling class, record the heroic struggle of the working people, and praise the heroic spirit of the working people who are not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of sacrifice, dare to struggle, and dare to win. Wu Han opposes history writing about class struggle, Wu Han tries his best to uglify the working people, and beautifies emperors, generals, and ministers, fully exposing his stubborn stand on the bourgeois class, anti-Party, and anti-socialist political face.

    Wu Han, under the pretext of opposing "the theory of solely judging people by their origin," strongly opposes using the proletarian viewpoint to evaluate historical figures. He opposes class analysis and advocates evaluating historical figures based on the evaluation of the feudal ruling class. Why is he so afraid of class analysis? Because class analysis is the demon-revealing mirror in our hands. Observing things from the perspective of class analysis can not only recognize the class nature of emperors, generals, and ministers in history, but also reveal the true face of people like Wu Han. Chairman Mao taught us, "In class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are branded with a class mark." The so-called "great politicians" in history worshiped by Wu Han are all politicians of the feudal ruling class. What kind of tree blooms what kind of flower, what kind of vine bears what kind of melon, what class speaks what kind of words. The position and viewpoint of the politicians of the feudal ruling class are fundamentally opposed to the working people. We must never evaluate historical figures based on the comments of feudal politicians, and we must never look at history with their eyes. History is created by our working people.

    Wu Han slanders the working people in every possible way, but praises and glorifies the emperors, generals, and ministers in every possible way. Who are the emperors, generals, and ministers? They are the big landlords, the political representatives of the feudal ruling class, the culprits who exploit, rule, and suppress the working people, and the enemies of the working people. I lived in the old society for more than 40 years, and I never saw a truly "honest official" who did things for the people, nor did I encounter a landlord who returned land to the peasants. On the contrary, what I encountered were landlords who tried every means to deprive the peasants of their land, and bad officials who were corrupt and perverted the law, ruled and suppressed the people. In 1946, when porter Zhang Zhuangyin was carrying luggage for passengers at the station, the headman Ma Wenyuan insisted that the station's territory was his, and without saying a word, ordered thugs to beat Zhang Zhuangyin to death. Zhang Zhuangyin's family filed a complaint with the puppet garrison headquarters, but Ma Wenyuan secretly intervened, and the garrison headquarters dismissed the manslaughter case. Zhang Zhuangyin's family went to the puppet court to file a complaint, and Ma Wenyuan bribed the puppet judge. As a result, the judge ruled that Zhang Zhuangyin died of illness and had nothing to do with the headman. The yamen before liberation was open to the rich, "money makes the mare go," and the poor had no place to appeal for grievances. Wu Han distorts history, promotes the virtues of "honest officials," and spreads the theory of class reconciliation, in order to restore capitalism. We warn Wu Han, this is impossible!

    From 1959 to 1962, our country suffered from three consecutive years of natural disasters, coupled with the revisionists taking advantage of the situation, we encountered temporary economic difficulties. At this time, Wu Han threw out his "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," cooperating with the right-leaning opportunists to attack the Party. Wu Han, through the mouth of Hai Rui, subtly smeared our Party and socialism.

    We, the working class, will never allow Wu Han to slander our Party and socialism. During the three years of natural disasters, under the leadership of the Party, the people of our country overcame all kinds of difficulties, making industrial and agricultural production enter a comprehensive new high tide. Now, our "Gate No. 6" freight yard has also further realized the hardening of the sidewalks, and the loading and unloading operations have begun to be mechanized. These achievements have been achieved under the guidance of the general line, and they all shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. The Communist Party is our great savior, our guide. Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialism is attacking the lifeblood of our working class. We, the working class, must resolutely smash Wu Han's rampant offensive. We have suffered enough from the old society. Whoever vainly attempts to restore capitalism, we will definitely make him hit his head and bleed. We must study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, listen to the Party's words, listen to Chairman Mao's words, improve our class consciousness, improve our revolutionary vigilance, resolutely repel the attacks of all kinds of demons and monsters, and defend the Party and socialism like protecting our eyes.

    坚决打退牛鬼蛇神的进攻
             天津车站“六号门”老工人　魏鹤林
    我是北京铁路局天津站“六号门”的老工人。对于吴晗恶毒地诬蔑我们劳动人民，疯狂地攻击党，攻击社会主义的言行，感到十分气愤，我们要坚决给予反击。
    一九四六年，吴晗诬蔑我党领导的革命战争是“两党相持，人民受罪，结怨于人民是不会有什么好处的”。解放后，他又指责我们的许多历史教材“都强调农民起义、农民战争”，把“历史上的光明面丧失了”，使祖国历史成为“漆黑一团，灰溜溜的”。这充分暴露了他对革命的仇视态度。
    毛主席教导我们说：“在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权。”又说：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”我们可以看出吴晗所说的是十足的反革命腔调。
    我们为什么要向反动统治阶级进行斗争？为什么要革命？因为反动统治阶级压迫我们，剥削我们，不斗争，不革命，我们就得不到解放。就拿“六号门”来说，解放前，封建把头、官僚资本家对我们工人的剥削已经到了敲骨吸髓的程度。工人每天要进行十几个小时的超重劳动，所得的装卸费，被把头剥夺了百分之八十至百分之九十，工人一天得的工钱只能买二斤杂合面。在残酷的剥削下，工人吃不饱，穿不暖，成天在饥饿死亡线上挣扎。那时，我因为饿得支持不住，收了一把撒在地上的土糖，叫把头的腿子看见，送到警务段过电、灌凉水，折腾了一个多月，差点送了命。工人王波因为吃了一口生面，叫把头和日本鬼子给活活打死。冻死，饿死，卖儿卖女的事情经常发生。封建把头不仅在经济上残酷地剥削工人，而且和帝国主义、反动政府串通一气。他们豢养打手，勾结特务，残酷地统治和镇压工人，妄想叫工人永远给他当牛作马，任其宰割。解放前，在工人中流传着这么几句话：“要吃脚行饭，就得拿命换。”“下铺地，上盖天，头上枕着半块砖。”在这样残酷的剥削和压迫下，工人不斗争，不革命，就没法活。为了翻身，为了解放，我们在党的领导下组织起来，坚持斗争，把头们疯狂叫嚷六号门上不挂几个脑袋不太平。看吧，阶级斗争就是这样的尖锐！我们能让阶级敌人宰割吗？
    在共产党和毛主席的领导下，一九四九年全国革命胜利了。“六号门”的工人推翻了封建把头的统治，成了货场的主人。但是脚行把头并不甘心失败。他们通过种种手段破坏社会主义建设，妄想复辟。在党的领导下，我们一次又一次地打退了他们的进攻。我们亲身体验到，阶级斗争忘不得，革命停不得。对于我们广大劳动人民来说，阶级斗争就是历史的光明面。无产阶级的历史，正是要揭露反动统治阶级的罪恶统治，记载劳动人民的英勇斗争，歌颂劳动人民不怕困难、不怕牺牲，敢于斗争、敢于胜利的英雄气概。吴晗反对历史写阶级斗争，吴晗尽力丑化劳动人民，美化帝王将相，充分暴露了他顽固地站在资产阶级立场，反党反社会主义的政治面目。
    吴晗借口反对“唯成份论”，极力反对用无产阶级观点评价历史人物。反对阶级分析，主张根据封建统治阶级的评价来评价历史人物。为什么他这么害怕阶级分析呢？因为阶级分析是我们手中的照妖镜，用阶级分析的观点观察事物，不仅可以认清历史上帝王将相的阶级本质，而且也会照出吴晗这种人的真面目。毛主席教导我们说，“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”吴晗所崇拜的历史上的所谓“大政治家”，都是封建统治阶级的政治家。什么树开什么花，什么蔓结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。封建统治阶级的政治家的立场观点，和劳动人民是根本对立的，我们绝不能根据封建政治家的评论来评价历史人物，绝不能用他们的眼光来看历史。历史是我们劳动人民创造的。
    吴晗对劳动人民百般诬蔑，但对帝王将相却极力美化，极力歌颂。帝王将相是什么人？是大地主，是封建统治阶级的政治代表，是剥削、统治和镇压劳动人民的罪魁，是劳动人民的敌人。我在旧社会生活了四十多年，根本没看见一个真正为人民办事的“清官”，没遇到一个把田退给农民的地主。相反，遇到的都是千方百计剥夺农民土地的地主，都是贪赃枉法、统治和镇压人民的坏官。一九四六年，搬运工人张庄印在车站为旅客搬运行李，把头马文元硬说车站的地盘是他的，不由分说，喝令打手把张庄印活活打死。张庄印的家属到伪警备司令部告状，马文元暗中打点，警备司令部推出了这件人命案不管。张庄印的家属又到伪法院告状，马文元贿赂了伪法官。结果，法官判决张庄印因病身亡，与把头无关。解放前的衙门是为有钱人开的，“有钱能使鬼推磨”，穷人有冤无处诉。吴晗歪曲历史，宣扬
  “清官”的德政，散布阶级调和论，是为资本主义复辟。我们正告吴晗，这办不到！
    一九五九年到一九六二年，我国连续遭受三年自然灾害，加上修正主义趁火打劫，我们经济上遇到了暂时困难。这时，吴晗抛出了他的《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》，配合右倾机会主义向党进攻。吴晗借海瑞之口，拐弯抹角地污蔑我们党和社会主义。
    我们工人阶级，决不允许吴晗污蔑我们的党和社会主义。在三年自然灾害期间，我国人民在党的领导下，战胜了种种困难，使工农业生产进入了全面新高潮。现在，我们“六号门”货场也进一步实现了走行道硬面化，装卸作业开始实现了机械化。这些成就都是在总路线的指引下取得的，都闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。共产党是我们的大救星，是我们的领路人。吴晗反党、反社会主义，就是攻击我们工人阶级的命根子。我们工人阶级要坚决粉碎吴晗的猖狂进攻。旧社会的苦我们受够了，谁妄想复辟资本主义，我们定叫他碰得头破血流。我们要更加努力学习毛主席著作，听党的话，听毛主席的话，提高阶级觉悟，提高革命警惕，坚决击退各种牛鬼蛇神的进攻，象保护眼睛一样捍卫党，捍卫社会主义。
