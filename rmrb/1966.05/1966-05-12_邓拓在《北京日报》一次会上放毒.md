    The editor's note of *Frontline* and *Beijing Daily* on April 16 stated that in this struggle, "we relaxed the class struggle on the cultural and academic front" and "lost our position or lost vigilance." This is complete nonsense! Since the criticism of *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* last year, they have not only failed to correct their mistakes but have continued to adhere to the bourgeois standpoint, persist in the bourgeois direction, and shield, cover up, and exonerate anti-Party elements. Look at the facts:

      Deng Tuo said that Wu Han had
  correct points, and Comrade Yao Wenyuan
  had incorrect points

      (1) On November 10 last year, Comrade Yao Wenyuan made a solemn criticism of the political errors of *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* in *Wenhui Daily*. On November 29, the *Liberation Army Daily* reprinted Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article, and in the editor's note, it clearly pointed out that *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* is a poisonous weed. On December 2, Deng Tuo said at a meeting of the *Beijing Daily*: "The *Liberation Army Daily* says that *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* is a poisonous weed because the army is engaged in internal education, and there can be no contention within the army. In fact, it is not yet certain that *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* is a poisonous weed!" He also said: "Wu Han has not written a play before. This time he wrote the play with emotion, comparing himself to Hai Rui. Now, we do indeed need to promote a good atmosphere in academic circles. First of all, we must treat *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* as an academic issue for discussion. Yao Wenyuan's article talked about political issues, and Wu Han will also respond. But the main issue is still an academic issue, so we should pay attention to the tone and manner of our articles and not add big labels. We should use a tone of consultation and exploration. This time, it is probably better to conduct academic discussions!" He also said: "Articles can explain Wu Han's mistakes and also give examples of his correct points; the same goes for Yao Wenyuan." Obviously, from the very beginning of this struggle, Deng Tuo tried his best to cover up all of Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist political problems, and dragged this political struggle into a "pure" academic debate. In this way, he could both exonerate Wu Han and muddle through himself. A few days later, the person in charge of *Beijing Daily* said at a meeting: "We should start with academic issues, but it is unavoidable to involve politics." On December 12, *Frontline* and *Beijing Daily* indeed published Xiang Yangsheng, i.e., Deng Tuo's sham criticism of Wu Han. In this sham criticism, Deng Tuo described Wu Han's monstrous crimes of opposing the Party as an academic issue of "moral inheritance theory," and thus staged an ugly farce of "Zhou Yu hitting Huang Gai."

      *Beijing Daily* believes that
  others criticize Wu Han politically, "we
  have our own way of doing things"

    (2) After Wu Han's *Self-Criticism on <Hai Rui Dismissed from Office>* was published, *People's Daily* published two consecutive articles, focusing on criticizing Wu Han's political problems. Someone suggested that *Beijing Daily* should also focus on criticizing Wu Han's political problems. However, a comrade from the theoretical department of the newspaper conveyed the intention of the newspaper's leadership, saying: "We have our own way of doing things." On January 12, *Frontline* and *Beijing Daily* again threw out Wu Han's *Self-Criticism on the Discussion of Morality*, trying to drag this political struggle back to some "academic issue."

    *Frontline* and *Beijing Daily* have not been "losing their position" or "relaxing" the class struggle for a long time, but stubbornly standing on the bourgeois standpoint and persisting in the bourgeois direction. We must thoroughly expose and criticize them!

    邓拓在《北京日报》一次会上放毒
    蔡少卿
    四月十六日《前线》和《北京日报》的编者按说，在这一场斗争中，“我们放松了文化学术战线上的阶级斗争”，“丧失立场或者丧失警惕”。这完全是骗人的鬼话！从去年批判《海瑞罢官》以来，他们不但没有改正错误，而且继续坚持资产阶级的立场，坚持资产阶级的方向，包庇、掩护、开脱反党分子。请看事实：
      邓拓说，吴晗有对的地
  方，姚文元同志有错的地方
      （一）去年十一月十日姚文元同志在《文汇报》对《海瑞罢官》的政治错误提出严正的批判。十一月二十九日，《解放军报》转载了姚文元同志的文章，在编者按语里明确指出：《海瑞罢官》，是一株大毒草。十二月二日，邓拓在《北京日报》的一个会上就说：“《解放军报》说《海瑞罢官》是株大毒草，是因为军队搞内部教育，军队内部不能争鸣。其实，现在并没有肯定《海瑞罢官》是株大毒草！”又说：“吴晗并没有写过戏，他这次写戏是有感情的，他把自己比作海瑞。现在，我们的的确确还要在学术界提倡好的风气，首先要把《海瑞罢官》当作学术问题来讨论，姚文元的文章是谈了政治问题，吴晗也会作回答。但主要问题还是在学术问题上，所以我们写文章的语调、口气要注意，不要加大帽子，要用商讨的语气，探讨的语气。这次恐怕还是作学术探讨为好！”他还说：“文章可以说明吴晗错的地方，也可以举出他对的地方；对姚文元也一样。”很显然，邓拓在这场斗争一开始，就极力把吴晗的反党反社会主义的政治问题全部掩盖起来，把这场政治斗争拉到“纯”学术的争论上。这样既可以开脱吴晗，又可以使自己蒙混过关。过了几天，《北京日报》负责人在一次会上又说：“要从学术问题谈起，但不避免涉及政治。”十二月十二日，《前线》和《北京日报》果真发表了向阳生即邓拓对吴晗的假批判。邓拓在这个假批判中，把吴晗反党的滔天罪行，说成是什么“道德继承论”的学术问题，就这样演了一出“周瑜打黄盖”的丑剧。
      《北京日报》认为，别
  人从政治上批判吴晗，“我们
  有我们的做法”
    （二）吴晗的《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》发表以后，《人民日报》连续发表两篇文章，集中批判了吴晗的政治问题。有人建议《北京日报》也要着重批判吴晗的政治问题。可是，该报理论部的一位同志转达该报社领导的意图说：“我们有我们的做法”。一月十二日，《前线》和《北京日报》又抛出了吴晗的《关于道德讨论的自我批评》，力图再次把这场政治斗争拉向什么“学术问题”上去。
    《前线》和《北京日报》长期以来，决不是什么“丧失立场”、“放松了”阶级斗争，而是顽固地站在资产阶级立场上，坚持资产阶级方向。我们必须彻底加以揭露和批判！
