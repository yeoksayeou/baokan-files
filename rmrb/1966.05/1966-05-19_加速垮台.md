    Accelerating Collapse
    The decision of the Thai Thanom group to send troops to directly participate in the US imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam has aroused strong anger and opposition from the Thai people. The "Voice of the People of Thailand" radio station has recently repeatedly published commentaries, calling on the Thai people to rise up against this dangerous action of US imperialism and the Thai reactionaries, and to prevent them from pushing the Thai people into the abyss of disaster. The Chinese people support this just stand of the Thai people.
    In the US imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam and Indochina, the Thai Thanom group has long played the role of an accomplice. It not only provides the United States with aggressive bases and various military facilities, but also repeatedly acts as an accomplice, secretly participating in the US imperialist war of aggression against Laos, and constantly carrying out military provocations against Cambodia. Now, the Thanom group has blatantly decided to directly send troops to participate in the war, indicating that it is determined to serve US imperialism and openly stands on the front line of the US war of aggression against Vietnam, acting as a thug.
    However, the result of this adventurous act by the Thai authorities can only be to lift a stone to drop it on one's own feet. Since it wants to blatantly participate in the US imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam, it will inevitably link Thailand with the Vietnamese battlefield, and it will inevitably link its own destiny with the destiny of US imperialism. Since US imperialism, the arch-criminal of aggression, cannot escape the severe punishment of the Vietnamese and Indochinese people and has repeatedly suffered heavy defeats, the fate of the Thai reactionary authorities, as an accomplice of the United States, is also predictable. The Vietnamese and Indochinese people, who have achieved great victories and rich experience in the struggle against US aggression, will certainly severely teach this US running dog a lesson.
    The Thai people will never forgive this sinful act of the Thanom group. It is believed that the more the Thai authorities step up their involvement in the US war of aggression against Vietnam, the more it will arouse the Thai people's struggle against US imperialism and its running dog, the Thanom group, and the more it will accelerate its own collapse. Those who play with fire will burn themselves. The Thanom group can never escape this end.

### 加速垮台

    加速垮台
    泰国他侬集团决定派兵直接参加美帝侵越战争的罪行，已经激起了泰国人民的强烈愤怒与反对。“泰国人民之声”电台最近一再发表评论，号召泰国人民起来反对美帝国主义和泰国反动当局的这一危险行动，阻止它们把泰国人民推向灾难的深渊。中国人民支持泰国人民的这种正义立场。
    在美帝国主义侵略越南和印度支那的战争中，泰国他侬集团早已充当了帮凶的角色。它不仅为美国提供侵略基地和各种军事便利，而且一再为虎作伥，偷偷地参加了美帝国主义侵略老挝的战争，不断地对柬埔寨进行军事挑衅。现在他侬集团悍然决定直接出兵参战，说明它已死心塌地为美帝国主义效劳，公开站到美国侵越战争的前线，充当起打手来了。
    但是，泰国当局的这种冒险行径，其结果只能是搬起石头打自己的脚。既然它要明目张胆地参加美帝国主义的侵越战争，它就不可避免地使泰国同越南战场联系起来，也不可避免地使它自己的命运同美帝国主义的命运联系起来。既然美帝国主义这个侵略元凶都逃脱不了越南人民和印度支那人民的严厉惩罚而一再遭受惨重失败，那么作为美帝帮凶的泰国反动当局的命运，也就可想而知了。在反对美国侵略的战斗中已经取得了伟大胜利和丰富经验的越南人民和印度支那人民，是一定会狠狠地教训这条美国走狗的。
    泰国人民也决不会饶恕他侬集团的这种罪恶行径。可以相信，泰国当局越是加紧卷入美国侵越战争，就越要激起泰国人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗他侬集团的斗争，而越加速自己的垮台。玩火者必自焚，他侬集团是决不能逃脱这个下场的。
