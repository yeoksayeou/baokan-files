    What Tricks Did the "Beijing Daily" Play in Its Rejection Letters?
    Beijing University Law Department Liang Jianmin, Chen Hengguang, Lin Wenken, Tian Meixiang
    In recent years, the "Frontline" and the "Beijing Daily" have released a large number of anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have expressed great indignation at this and have written articles to fight back. However, the "Beijing Daily" has suppressed the manuscripts of the broad masses of readers and refused to publish them. Since the nationwide criticism of Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes, they have been shrinking their positions step by step, implementing cover-ups. They returned a large number of manuscripts from the broad masses of readers criticizing Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and others, and also adopted different methods in reply letters at different times to deceive readers and try their best to cover up their political problems.
    Just look at the following three rejection letters, and it will be clear at a glance.
    After Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article criticizing Wu Han and the "Liberation Army Daily" editor's note raised the political issue, the "Beijing Daily" in a rejection reply letter, still wanted readers to "continue to study the Hai Rui issue" and "hope for academic value" (emphasis added by the author, same below). As everyone knows, Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and other poisonous weeds are entirely political issues, not purely academic issues. However, they deliberately pulled readers towards academic issues, and their purpose was not to cover up the anti-Party and anti-socialist essence of Wu Han?
    The "Beijing Daily" not only wanted readers to write critical articles with "academic value," but also drew many frameworks for readers, only allowing readers to write from aspects such as "the analysis of 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,' the issue of moral inheritance, the evaluation of historical figures, history and historical plays, historical viewpoints, etc." What they prescribed for readers were not political issues, not key issues, but some painless and insignificant issues. Why did they do this? We understand this in our hearts, and they understand it in their hearts.
    They also forced readers in their reply letters to write articles that they considered to be "with viewpoints and materials." What is called "with viewpoints"? Is criticizing Wu Han politically considered without viewpoints? Are the manuscripts that they suppressed and returned all without viewpoints? Obviously, the "viewpoints" they wanted were not the viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism, not Mao Zedong Thought, but the viewpoints of the bourgeoisie and revisionism! Then, what is called "with materials"? Isn't the material reflecting the reality of class struggle material? In their view, only people like Deng Tuo and Wu Han who extensively quoted ancient books were considered to have "materials." No wonder they wanted readers to write extensively about "the evaluation of historical figures, history and historical plays, historical viewpoints." This can only be an attempt to scare the workers, peasants, and soldiers in order to achieve the goal of preventing the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers from participating in this socialist cultural revolution.
    In short, in this letter, the "Beijing Daily" tried its best to protect anti-Party and anti-socialist elements.
    After the workers, peasants, and soldiers vigorously launched political criticism nationwide, they felt that the situation was not right and changed their tone in another reply letter.
    In this reply letter, they dared not blatantly pull readers towards academic aspects again, dared not specifically draw frameworks, and dared not raise political criticisms in the letter. It can be seen that they were extremely timid! Many of the manuscripts returned by them were criticisms of anti-Party elements such as Wu Han from a political perspective, but they babbled nonsense in the reply letter, saying, "Although the manuscript cannot be published, it is helpful for us to understand the situation and further improve our propaganda work." What does this mean!
    Why was the "Beijing Daily" so afraid of criticizing Wu Han's towering crimes of being anti-Party and anti-socialist from a political perspective? To put it bluntly, they had a guilty conscience: they were afraid that this would expose Deng Tuo, the big shopkeeper of such an anti-Party and anti-socialist black shop.
    However, things went against their wishes. Due to the recent exposure of the anti-Party and anti-socialist faces of Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and others, Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist ugly face could no longer be covered up. Therefore, they hurriedly published the summary materials of "Sanjiacun" and "Yanshan Yehua." After that, their methods became even more despicable and vile in their reply letters to readers, continuing to provide cover for Deng Tuo.
    At the beginning of the letter, they lied to readers, saying that they had "launched" "criticism of 'Sanjiacun' and 'Yanshan Yehua' in the newspaper." In fact, after publishing the so-called "materials" that covered up the main points, highlighted the secondary points, avoided the important points, and minimized the major issues, they did not conduct genuine criticism of Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes in the newspaper.
    They also said that the manuscripts from the broad masses of readers criticizing Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements were all "not sharp enough in their viewpoints," and also said that "too many issues were discussed," asking readers to write manuscripts "focusing on one issue, one viewpoint, or one article." Is Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialism merely a matter of "one issue," "one viewpoint," or "one article"? Absolutely not! They simply wanted to tear apart Deng Tuo's gang's anti-Party and anti-socialist ideological system, only allowing everyone to see these people's individual problems and individual viewpoints in isolation.
    In the reply letter, they also said that the submitted manuscripts should "present facts, reason, and conduct concrete analysis, dissection, and criticism." In other words, isn't this saying that many of the returned manuscripts that criticized Deng Tuo and others' anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes with Mao Zedong Thought did not "present facts," did not "reason," and did not "conduct concrete analysis"? Isn't this regarding these manuscripts as merely putting labels on Deng Tuo and his gang? In fact, they were the ones who put a lot of labels on the contributors, such as "the viewpoints are not sharp enough," "the analysis is not deep enough," and so on. In addition, they also said that "some discuss too many issues, and the viewpoints and materials are not concentrated and prominent enough; some, although they discuss one issue, the analysis and criticism are not sufficient enough." Discussing too many issues is not allowed, and discussing too few issues is not allowed. This is simply not allowing everyone to criticize Deng Tuo and his gang's towering crimes.
    The "Beijing Daily" easily said that Deng Tuo's extremely serious political problem was an academic problem, and arranged for it to be "criticized" in their "Academic Criticism Group." The letter did not mention Deng Tuo by name, isn't this clearly providing cover for him again?
    In the reply letter, the "Beijing Daily" also repeatedly called itself a "Party newspaper." In fact, they had long become a tool for Deng Tuo, Liao Mosha, Wu Han, and their gang to oppose the Party and socialism. They both exonerated Wu Han and protected Deng Tuo from getting through. To this day, they are still playing tricks and stubbornly resisting. No matter how cunning their methods are, they cannot deceive us. We must open fire on the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line!

    《北京日报》的退稿信耍了什么花招？
    北京大学法律系　梁建民　陈亨光　林文肯　田美湘
    近几年来，《前线》、《北京日报》放出了大批反党反社会主义的毒草，广大工农兵群众对此表示极大愤慨，纷纷写稿进行反击。但是，《北京日报》却把广大读者的稿件扣压起来，不予发表。自从全国开展批判吴晗反党反社会主义罪行以来，他们步步缩紧阵地，实行掩护。他们把广大读者大量反击邓拓、吴晗等人的稿件，退了回去，并且还在不同时期的复信中，采取不同手法，欺骗读者，极力掩盖其政治问题。
    请看下面三封退稿信，便会一目了然。
    在姚文元同志批判吴晗的文章和《解放军报》按语提出了政治问题以后，《北京日报》在一封退稿的复信中，还一直要读者去“继续研究海瑞问题”，并“希望有学术性”（着重点为引者所加，下同）。众所周知，吴晗的《海瑞罢官》等毒草完全是政治问题，而不是什么单纯的学术问题。但是，他们却故意把读者往学术问题上拉，其目的不正是掩盖吴晗的反党反社会主义的本质吗？
    《北京日报》不仅要读者写批判文章要“有学术性”，而且还给读者划了许多框框，只准读者从“关于《海瑞罢官》的分析，道德继承问题，历史人物评价，历史和历史剧，历史观等”方面去写稿。他们给读者所规定的都不是政治问题，不是要害问题，而是一些不痛不痒的枝节问题。他们为什么要这样干呢？对此，我们心里明白，他们心里也明白。
    他们还在复信中，强求读者去写他们认为的“有观点，有材料”的文章。什么才叫做“有观点”呢？难道从政治上批判吴晗就是没观点了吗？难道被他们扣压起来、退出去的稿件都是没有观点的吗？很明显，他们所要的“观点”，不是马克思列宁主义的观点，不是毛泽东思想，而是资产阶级、修正主义的观点！那么，什么又才叫做“有材料”呢？难道反映阶级斗争实况的材料就不是材料吗？在他们看来，象邓拓、吴晗那样大引古书才算“有材料”，也难怪他们要读者大写特写有关“历史人物评价，历史和历史剧，历史观”的文章了。这只能是企图以此吓唬工农兵，以便达到不让广大工农兵参加这场社会主义文化大革命的目的。
    总之，在这封信中，《北京日报》极力包庇反党反社会主义分子。
    工农兵在全国大力展开了政治问题批判以后，他们感到形势不对头，就在另一封复信中改变了腔调。
    在这封复信中，他们既不敢明目张胆地再把读者往学术方面拉，又不敢具体的划出框框，更不敢在信中提出政治问题的批判，可见他们心虚到了极点！被他们退回的稿件许多都是从政治方面批判吴晗等反党分子的，可他们却在复信中牛头不对马嘴的胡扯什么：“稿子虽然不能发表，但是对我们了解情况，进一步改进宣传工作是有帮助的。”这到底是什么意思！
    《北京日报》为什么那样害怕从政治上去批判吴晗反党反社会主义的滔天罪行呢？说穿了，是他们心里有鬼：他们害怕由此而把邓拓这样一个反党反社会主义黑店的大掌柜暴露出来。
    但是，事与愿违。由于最近吴晗、廖沫沙等人的反党反社会主义面目的大暴露，邓拓的反党反社会主义丑恶面目再也无法掩盖了。于是，他们匆匆忙忙发表了“三家村”和《燕山夜话》的摘要材料。此后，他们在给读者复信中，手法更加卑鄙、恶劣，继续替邓拓打掩护。
    他们在信的开头，就向读者撒谎，说什么：他们“报上展开”了“对‘三家村’和《燕山夜话》的批判。”其实，他们在发表了掩盖主要、突出次要、避重就轻、大事化小的所谓“材料”以后，根本没有在报上对邓拓的反党反社会主义罪行进行真正的批判。
    他们还把广大读者批判邓拓这伙反党反社会主义分子的稿件，都说成是什么“观点还不够鲜明”，还说什么“谈的问题太多”，要读者“针对一个问题，一个观点，或一篇文章”写出稿件。难道邓拓反党反社会主义仅仅只是“一个问题”、“一个观点”、“一篇文章”的问题吗？决不是！他们无非是要将邓拓这一伙的反党反社会主义的思想体系割裂开来，只让大家孤立地看到这些人的个别问题、个别观点。
    在复信中，他们还说什么来稿要“摆事实，讲道理，进行具体的分析，解剖，批判”。言下之意，这岂不是把退回来的许多用毛主席思想批判邓拓等人反党反社会主义罪行的稿件都说成是不“摆事实”，不“讲道理”，不“进行具体分析”的吗？这岂不是把这些稿件看成仅仅是给邓拓他们扣帽子的吗？事实上，正是他们给投稿者扣上一大堆帽子，什么“观点还不够鲜明”呀，什么“分析得还不够深刻”呀，如此等等。另外，他们还说什么来稿中“有的谈的问题太多，观点和材料都不够集中突出；有的虽然谈一个问题，但分析批判得还不够充分”。谈的问题多了不行，少了也不行，这简直就是不让大家批判邓拓这伙人的滔天罪行。
    《北京日报》把邓拓极其严重的政治问题轻轻松松地说是学术问题，把它安排在他们的什么“学术批判组”内“批判”，信中对邓拓其人只字不提，这不又明明在替他打掩护吗？
    《北京日报》在复信中，还口口声声自称为“党报”。其实，他们早已成为邓拓、廖沫沙、吴晗这伙人反党反社会主义的工具。他们既为吴晗开脱，又保护邓拓过关。时至今日，他们还在继续玩弄花招，顽强抵抗。无论他们的手腕如何狡猾，都骗不了我们，我们一定要向反党反社会主义的黑线开火！
