    Worker-Peasant-Soldier Masses Participating in Academic Criticism is an Epoch-Making Event
                  《Red Flag》Magazine Commentator
      For several months, the academic circles have launched a major debate starting from the criticism of Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." What is particularly exciting in this major debate is that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have also enthusiastically joined the struggle. Recently, the worker-peasant-soldier masses in many places have held symposiums, expressed their opinions, and written articles to criticize Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist political and academic views. They said that this major debate is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, and a major event related to the fate of the country. Our working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, and PLA fighters cannot ignore it, cannot remain indifferent, and must actively participate in this class struggle, defeat the bourgeoisie's frenzied attacks, and win a complete victory in this major debate.
      The participation of the worker-peasant-soldier masses in academic criticism has brought about an unprecedentedly lively situation in this major debate.
      The participation of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in academic criticism is an unprecedented initiative in world history. In the old society, whether in feudal or capitalist society, the academic forum was completely monopolized by a small handful of feudal literati and bourgeois scholars, whose academic pursuits served the interests of the exploiting classes. The worker-peasant masses were deprived of the right to education and the possibility of participating in academic work. People always thought of academics and theory as the business of a few intellectuals. Our people's revolution has triumphed, and the worker-peasant masses have become masters economically and politically, and they must also become masters of culture. The death knell of the exploiting classes' monopoly of culture and academics has sounded. The era in which the worker-peasant-soldier masses directly grasp theory has begun, and the era in which the worker-peasant-soldier masses directly ascend the academic forum has also begun. This is a matter of great historical significance.
    The participation of the worker-peasant-soldier masses in academic criticism is the result of creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Facts have proved that the worker-peasant-soldier masses, having mastered the powerful weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, can not only use it to improve their own work, but also use it to participate in the class struggle in the ideological field.
    The participation of the worker-peasant-soldier masses in academic criticism is a source of joy and encouragement to all revolutionaries. However, intellectuals who adhere to the bourgeois reactionary stand feel that the foundation upon which they base their lives is about to collapse, and they make all sorts of excuses to oppose the participation of workers, peasants, and soldiers in academic criticism. They adopt an aristocratic attitude, saying, "One is not qualified to evaluate historical figures without reading the Twenty-Four Histories." And, "Workers, peasants, and soldiers do not understand history!" In their view, the worker-peasant-soldier masses are not qualified to speak on academic issues.
    The worker-peasant-soldier masses have made a strong rebuttal to this fallacy. They said, although we have not read the Twenty-Four Histories written by the landlord class, we have Chairman Mao's works, we have our own practice of revolutionary struggle, and we have our own "Four Histories" – family history, village history, factory history, and commune history. With these, we can completely refute all the deceptive fallacies of the feudal class and the bourgeoisie.
    Absolutely correct! Mao Zedong Thought is our most powerful weapon for overcoming all kinds of feudal and bourgeois academic views, and the practice of revolutionary struggle and the "Four Histories" are powerful bases for refuting the evil theories of the exploiting classes.
    To say "workers, peasants, and soldiers do not understand history." We should ask, what is history? Who does not understand history?
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Class struggle, some classes triumph, others are eliminated. Such is history, such is the history of civilization for thousands of years."① The history written by landlord class literati and bourgeois scholars distorts the truth of class struggle, conceals the facts of class struggle, completely obliterates the status and role of the working people, and praises emperors, generals, and bourgeois rulers. In their writings, history is completely turned upside down. Therefore, from the Marxist point of view, even if one can recite the Twenty-Four Histories fluently, one cannot be considered to understand history.
    Who truly understands history? Not those feudal class and bourgeois historians who regard the Twenty-Four Histories as the golden rule, but the worker-peasant-soldier masses and proletarian revolutionary cadres.
    Workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, they remember their own tragic family histories, they are familiar with their own village histories and factory histories. In these histories, there is exploitation, there is anti-exploitation, there is oppression, there is anti-oppression, filled with fierce class struggle. Only the working people who have been exploited and oppressed understand the history of class struggle best.
    The worker-peasant-soldier masses read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, greatly enhancing their class consciousness, so they have a keen sense of smell and sharp eyes, and they can distinguish what is fragrant flower and what is poisonous weed most clearly and see it most clearly. The materials from the symposium on academic criticism by the worker-peasant-soldier masses published in this issue of this journal powerfully illustrate this point.
    The important characteristic of the worker-peasant-soldier masses participating in academic criticism is highlighting politics. The worker-peasant-soldier masses, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and regarding the Party and socialism as their lifeblood, can see through all kinds of cunning means of Wu Han and others, smell them out, and reveal their reactionary political aims in a word.
      The worker-peasant-soldier masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought can express profound and correct opinions even on relatively complex academic issues. Their speeches at the symposium and the articles they published in newspapers and magazines spoke of many revolutionary and scientific truths that intellectuals did not and could not speak of. They can grasp the essence of the problem at once and explain the truth clearly and thoroughly in a few words.
    The so-called "incorruptible official" issue once confused many people. However, the worker-peasant-soldier masses used their own family histories and village and factory histories to prove that there were no "incorruptible officials" in the old society at all. They said, "No cat does not eat meat, no official does not make money," "Three years of clear prefect, ten thousand taels of silver," the so-called "incorruptible official" is completely fabricated by the landlord class to fool the people.
    The so-called "policy of concession" is a concept that has been quite popular in historical circles for a long time. However, as soon as the worker-peasant-soldier masses heard Wu Han and Jian Bozan promote the fallacy of the "policy of concession," they clearly pointed out that this was a complete distortion of historical facts. They said: "A dog will eat feces even after walking a thousand miles, a wolf will eat people even after walking a thousand miles," the nature of the landlord class will not change. Now that the landlords have been overthrown by us, they are still like "onions on the eaves, withered leaves, rotten roots, and an undying heart," unwilling to "concede." How can one imagine that the landlord class would adopt any "policy of concession" towards the peasants after the failure of the peasant revolution?
    On the so-called issue of moral inheritance, landlord and bourgeois scholars speak very beautifully of the morality of the exploiting classes. However, the worker-peasant-soldier masses used their own bloody and tearful family histories to accuse the morality of the landlord and bourgeois classes of being cannibalistic morality, the morality of "not getting rich without killing the poor." They said that the morality of the landlord and bourgeois classes is "sores on the top of the head, pus flowing from the soles of the feet" – completely bad, with not a single good thing.
    Look! How clear is the class viewpoint of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, how clear is the banner, and how thoroughly is the truth explained.
    In our entire revolutionary cause, the struggle in the political and economic fields depends on the workers, peasants, and soldiers; the cultural revolution, the struggle to promote the proletarian ideology and eradicate the bourgeois ideology on the cultural front, also depends on the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The worker-peasant-soldier masses are not only the main force in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, but also the main force in the socialist cultural revolution. Without the participation of the worker-peasant-soldier masses, no revolution can achieve complete victory. Only by relying on the worker-peasant-soldier masses and mobilizing the worker-peasant-soldier masses can we ensure that the socialist cultural revolution is carried through to the end and that the ideological roots of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism are completely eradicated.
    In the cultural revolution, as in revolutions in other fields, intellectuals play an important role. However, intellectuals must be combined with the worker-peasant-soldier masses. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If intellectuals do not integrate themselves with the workers and peasants, they will accomplish nothing. The final dividing line between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary intellectuals lies in whether they are willing to and do integrate themselves with the workers and peasants."② Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction is an absolute truth. In the current academic criticism, it is once again proved that intellectuals can only play their role in the cultural revolution if they stand on the proletarian stand, unite with the worker-peasant-soldier masses, and fight together with the worker-peasant-soldier masses.
    Mao Zedong Thought is the highest instruction for all our work. The worker-peasant-soldier masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought are an invincible force. The participation of the worker-peasant-soldier masses in the class struggle on the cultural front is an epoch-making event. The worker-peasant-soldier masses and revolutionary intellectuals, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, will surely win a complete victory in the cultural revolution.

### 工农兵群众参加学术批判是划时代的大事

    工农兵群众参加学术批判是划时代的大事
                  《红旗》杂志评论员
      几个月来，学术界从批判吴晗的《海瑞罢官》开始，展开了一场大论战。在这场大论战中，令人特别兴奋的是，广大工农兵群众也以极大的热情投入了斗争。最近，很多地方的工农兵群众纷纷举行座谈会，发议论，写文章，批判吴晗的反党反社会主义的政治观点和学术观点。他们说，这场大论战是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级的斗争，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，是关系国家命运的大事，我们工人阶级、贫农下中农、解放军战士，不能不管，不能不问，一定要积极参加这场阶级斗争，打垮资产阶级的猖狂进攻，赢得这场大论战的彻底胜利。
      工农兵群众参加学术批判，使这场大论战出现了一个前所未有的生动活泼的局面。
      广大工农兵群众参加学术批判，这在世界历史上是没有前例的创举。在旧社会里，不论在封建社会，还是在资本主义社会，学术论坛完全是被一小撮封建文人和资产阶级学者所垄断的，他们搞学术是为剥削阶级的利益服务的。工农大众被剥夺了受教育的权利，被剥夺了参加学术工作的可能。人们一提起学术，一提起理论，总认为这是少数知识分子的事情。我国人民革命胜利了，工农大众在经济上、政治上做了主人，也要做文化的主人。剥削阶级垄断文化学术的丧钟敲响了。工农兵群众直接掌握理论的时代已经开始了，工农兵群众直接登上学术论坛的时代也已经开始了。这是一件有重大历史意义的事。
    工农兵群众参加学术批判，是活学活用毛泽东思想的结果。事实证明，工农兵群众掌握了毛泽东思想这一强大武器，不仅能够用它改进自己的工作，而且能够用它参加意识形态领域里的阶级斗争。
    工农兵群众参加学术批判，一切革命者都感到欢欣鼓舞。然而坚持资产阶级反动立场的知识分子，却感到他们安身立命的基础快要完蛋了，于是制造种种借口反对工农兵参加学术批判。他们摆出贵族老爷式的态度，说什么，“不读完二十四史，就没有资格评价历史人物。”说什么，“工农兵不懂历史！”在他们看来，工农兵群众没有资格在学术问题上发言。
    工农兵群众对这种谬论作了有力的驳斥。他们说，我们虽然没有读过地主阶级写的二十四史，但是，我们有毛主席的著作，我们有自己革命斗争的实践，我们有自己的“四史”——家史、村史、厂史、社史。有了这些，我们就能把封建阶级、资产阶级一切骗人的谬论彻底驳倒。
    完全正确！毛泽东思想是我们战胜形形色色封建的、资产阶级的学术观点的最强大武器，革命斗争的实践和“四史”是驳斥剥削阶级邪说的有力根据。
    说“工农兵不懂历史”。我们倒要问问，究竟什么是历史？究竟是谁不懂历史？
    毛泽东同志说：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”①地主阶级文人和资产阶级学者写的历史，歪曲阶级斗争的真相，掩盖阶级斗争的事实，完全抹杀劳动人民的地位和作用，一味歌颂帝王将相和资产阶级统治者。在他们的笔下，历史完全被颠倒了。因此，从马克思主义观点看来，即使能把二十四史倒背如流，也不能算懂得历史。
    什么人才真正懂得历史呢？不是那些把二十四史奉为金科玉律的封建阶级、资产阶级史学家们，而是工农兵群众和无产阶级革命干部。
    工人，贫农下中农，他们记得自己的悲惨的家史，他们熟悉自己的村史、厂史。在这些历史里，有剥削，有反剥削，有压迫，有反压迫，充满着激烈的阶级斗争。只有曾经被剥削、被压迫的劳动人民，才最懂得阶级斗争的历史。
    工农兵群众读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，活学活用毛泽东思想，大大地提高了阶级觉悟，所以他们嗅觉灵敏，眼光锐利，对什么是香花，什么是毒草，分得最清，看得最明。本刊这一期发表的工农兵群众学术批判座谈会的材料，就有力地说明了这一点。
    工农兵群众参加学术批判的重要特点，就是突出政治。掌握了毛泽东思想、把党和社会主义看作是自己命根子的工农兵群众，对吴晗等人反党反社会主义的种种狡猾手段，都能看出来，嗅出来，一语道破他们的反动的政治目的。
      用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众，即使对比较复杂的学术问题，也能够发表深刻的正确的意见。他们在座谈会上的发言和在报刊上发表的文章，讲了许多知识分子没有讲也讲不出来的革命的科学的道理。他们能够一下子就抓住问题的本质，三言两语把道理讲得明白透彻。
    所谓“清官”问题，曾经迷惑了许多人。而工农兵群众却用自己的家史和村史、厂史，证实了旧社会根本没有什么“清官”。他们说，“哪有猫儿不吃荤，哪有官儿不贪财”，“三年清知府，十万雪花银”，所谓“清官”完全是地主阶级为了愚弄人民编造出来的。
    所谓“让步政策”，是历史学界长期以来相当流行的观念。而工农兵群众一听吴晗、翦伯赞宣扬“让步政策”的谬论，就明确指出这完全是歪曲历史事实。他们说：“狗走千里要吃粪，狼走千里要吃人”，地主阶级的本性是不会改变的。现在地主被我们打倒了，还象“屋檐上的洋葱，叶焦根烂心不死”，不肯“让步”，怎么能够想象地主阶级在农民革命失败后却对农民采取什么“让步政策”呢？
    在所谓道德继承问题上，地主资产阶级学者把剥削阶级的道德说得美妙的很。而工农兵群众却用自己血泪斑斑的家史，控诉了地主资产阶级的道德是吃人的道德，是“不杀穷人不富”的道德。他说，地主资产阶级道德是“头顶生疮，脚底流脓”——坏透了的，没有一点好东西。
    看！工农兵的阶级观点多么明确，旗帜多么鲜明，道理讲得多么透彻。
    在我们整个革命事业中，政治领域和经济领域里的斗争，要靠工农兵；文化革命，文化战线上兴无灭资的斗争，也要靠工农兵。工农兵群众不仅是阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的主力，也是社会主义文化革命的主力。没有工农兵群众的参加，任何革命都不会取得彻底胜利。只有依靠工农兵群众，发动工农兵群众，才能保证把社会主义的文化大革命进行到底，才能彻底挖掉封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的思想根子。
    在文化革命中同在其他领域的革命一样，知识分子具有重要的作用。但是知识分子必须和工农兵群众相结合。毛泽东同志说：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”②毛泽东同志这个指示，是千真万确的真理。在当前的学术批判中，再一次证明，知识分子只有站在无产阶级的立场上，和工农兵群众结合起来，同工农兵群众一道进行战斗，才能在文化革命中发挥自己的作用。
    毛泽东思想是我们各项工作的最高指示。用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众，是攻无不克、战无不胜的力量。工农兵群众参加文化战线上的阶级斗争，是一件划时代的大事。工农兵群众和革命的知识分子一起，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，一定能够取得文化革命的彻底胜利。
