    A warrior armed with Mao Zedong Thought possesses the greatest combat effectiveness. Thousands upon thousands of facts have proven this point. The teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School, through their practice, have once again proven this point.
    In the past, some people deliberately elevated so-called "classic works" such as "Swan Lake" and "Giselle" to the heavens, deliberately showing off their mysteriousness, and portraying these things as insurmountable peaks in the art of ballet. It seemed that the more incomprehensible something was, the more of a "treasure" it was. They themselves revolved around these bourgeois things, kowtowing to them, and even wanted others to follow suit and become their prisoners. In reality, these people have ulterior motives. They themselves are infatuated with this set of decadent, corrupt, and reactionary bourgeois things, and desperately want to preserve it on the stage, trying every possible way to inflate its value, using it to attack and suppress revolutionary literature and art, and to sing a counter-tune with revolutionary literature and art.
    The teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School have firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely implemented the policy of "making foreign things serve China" and "making the past serve the present," that literature and art must serve socialism and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and resolutely made ballet serve proletarian politics, making it understandable to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Based on this thought, and with this kind of revolutionary spirit, they dared to break through all the ideological frameworks that violate revolutionary interests and bind people's minds, break the old and establish the new, and create truly revolutionary ballet dramas that are welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    Content determines form. The content of revolutionary ballet inevitably requires it to change and develop in form. The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" absorbed nourishment from national traditional art, so that it innovated in terms of script structure, character shaping, and stage colors. Especially in terms of portraying character personalities and expressing character's inner worlds, it has improved compared to previous ballets. Characters such as Xi'er, Dachun, Yang Bailao, and Uncle Zhao have all left a deep impression on the audience. The music of the ballet has also been developed and created on the basis of the original opera music, especially the use of accompanying vocals, which not only plays a great role in highlighting the theme of the work, shaping the characters, and expressing the characters' emotions, but also gives the ballet a strong national style. The ballet's successful use of accompanying vocals has profound practical significance for expanding the content of revolutionary life in dance art and making dance art better serve socialism.

    “外为中用”的好样板
    田静
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，具有最大的战斗力。千千万万的事实证明了这一点。上海市舞蹈学校的师生用他们的实践，再一次证明了这一点。
    过去，有些人故意把《天鹅湖》、《吉赛尔》等所谓“经典作品”捧上了天，故意卖弄玄虚，把这些东西说成是芭蕾舞艺术中不可超越的顶峰。似乎越是没有人看得懂，它就越是“珍品”。他们自己围着这些资产阶级的东西团团转，对着它磕头，还想叫别人也跟着做，当它的俘虏。其实，这些人是别有用心的。他们自己迷恋资产阶级这一套没落、腐朽、反动的东西，极力想在舞台上保留它，千方百计地抬高它的身价，用它来打击、压制革命文艺，和革命的文艺唱对台戏。
    上海市舞蹈学校师生，牢牢记住了毛主席的教导，坚决贯彻“外为中用”、“古为今用”，文艺必须为社会主义服务、为工农兵服务的方针，坚决使芭蕾舞为无产阶级政治服务，让广大的工农兵群众看得懂。基于这一思想，有了这种革命精神，他们就敢于打破一切违反革命利益、束缚人的思想的框框，破旧立新，创造出真正为广大工农兵所欢迎的革命的芭蕾舞剧来。
    内容决定形式。革命的芭蕾舞的内容，必然要求它在形式上有所改变，有所发展。芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，从民族传统艺术中吸收了营养，使它在剧本结构、塑造人物、舞台色彩等方面都有所创新，特别是在刻划人物性格、表达人物内心世界方面，较以前的芭蕾舞都有提高。象喜儿、大春、杨白劳、赵大叔等人物，都给观众留下了深刻的印象。舞剧的音乐，也在原来歌剧音乐的基础上，有所发展，有所创造，尤其是伴唱的运用，不仅对突出作品的主题、塑造人物性格，抒发人物的感情方面，起了很大的作用，而且使舞剧具有了浓厚的民族风格。舞剧成功地运用伴唱，对扩大舞蹈艺术表现革命生活内容，使舞蹈艺术更好地为社会主义服务，有着深刻的现实意义。
