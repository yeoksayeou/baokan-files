    The Red Country is as Solid as a Rock
    Li Youxiu, Representative of the National People's Congress, Chairman of Wuliting Commune, Xingguo County

    Deng Tuo wants our Party to "say nothing" and "do nothing," and wants our Party to step down and "rest" quickly. This is simply a pipe dream! Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs are the same as imperialists, revisionists, and all reactionaries at home and abroad!

    The stark contrast between pre-liberation and post-liberation makes us deeply realize that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the saviors of us poor and lower-middle peasants, and we are forever linked heart-to-heart with the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. In the old society, we poor and lower-middle peasants were treated as beasts of burden by landlords and suffered all kinds of hardships. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us poor people to make revolution and only then did we achieve complete liberation. Take myself as an example. In the past, I worked as a short-term laborer for Huang Zhong'an, a big landlord in the village, and was treated like a beast of burden. I couldn't rest all year round, and I worked desperately for the landlord. But the landlord treated me worse than a dog. Only after liberation did a rural woman like me, who was looked down upon and suffered all kinds of torment from landlords in the old society, achieve complete liberation politically, economically, and culturally. The Party and the people also gave me great honor. I went to Beijing several times to attend meetings, met our great leader Chairman Mao, and shook hands with him affectionately. Chairman Mao, Chairman Liu, Premier Zhou, and other Party and state leaders also very kindly held meetings with us, discussing major Party affairs, major national affairs, and major world affairs. I love our Party and Chairman Mao from the bottom of my heart. Not only do the Chinese people love Chairman Mao, but all revolutionary people around the world also love Chairman Mao. The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are persecuted by imperialism and colonialism all regard Mao Zedong Thought as a magic weapon for achieving liberation. This is something you, Deng Tuo, cannot slander or stop.

    Deng Tuo also slanders our Great Leap Forward as "bragging" and "talking big." This is purely turning black and white upside down and talking nonsense with eyes wide open. To say nothing of the distant past, the facts of our commune and our county alone are enough to refute Deng Tuo's nonsense. Before liberation, Wuliting was a place where toads died of drought. After liberation, the Party led us to build water conservancy projects. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we, along with the people of the whole county, built the Changlong Reservoir, making more than 80 percent of the land in the entire commune realize self-flowing irrigation. Other areas prone to drought have also been equipped with water pumps. Most of the land has been freed from the threat of drought, and grain production has increased year after year. Isn't this a great achievement of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward? Tremendous changes have also taken place in Xingguo County as a whole. To say nothing else, let's just talk about medical and health undertakings. Before liberation, Xingguo only had one hospital. After liberation, medical and health undertakings developed greatly. After the Great Leap Forward, a brand-new People's Hospital was built. Now, every commune has a health center, and every team has a health worker, and people's health has been reliably guaranteed. Speaking of hospitals, it makes me hate the cannibalistic old society even more. My husband died of lung disease in the old society because he had no money to go to the hospital. Now, the hospital belongs to the people, and poor and lower-middle peasants can go to the People's Hospital when they are sick, and those in difficulty can also receive free treatment. This can only be done in the new society led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    Deng Tuo closes his eyes and insists that our Great Leap Forward is "bragging" and "talking big." This is ulterior motives. Deng Tuo, let me tell you, our red country is as stable as Mount Tai and as solid as a rock. No matter what demons and monsters make waves, they will never want to shake it. We are determined to fight to the end with all anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. We will never withdraw our troops until we eradicate the black line, destroy the black shop, and defeat the black gang.

    红色江山坚如磐石
    全国人民代表大会代表、兴国县五里亭公社社长　李友秀
    邓拓要我们党“什么话都不要说”、“什么事情都不能做”，要我们党赶快下台“休息”。这简直是白日做梦！邓拓一伙反党反社会主义黑帮，同帝国主义、修正主义和国内外一切反动派一个样！
    解放前后的鲜明对比，使我们深深认识到，共产党、毛主席是我们贫下中农的救命恩人，我们和共产党、毛主席是永远心连心的。旧社会，我们贫下中农，给地主当牛马，吃尽了人间苦头。共产党、毛主席领导我们穷人闹革命，才得到彻底翻身。就拿我自己来说吧，过去，我给村里的大地主黄仲安做短工，当牛马，一年到头都得不到休息，拼死拼活地为地主干活。可是地主待我还不如一只狗。象我这样一个在旧社会被人瞧不起的、受尽地主折磨的农村妇女，只有解放了，才在政治上、经济上、文化上得到了彻底的翻身。党和人民还给了我很大的荣誉，我几次上北京开会，见到了我们伟大的领袖毛主席，并和他亲切地握过手。毛主席、刘主席、周总理等党和国家领导人，还十分亲切地和我们在一起开会，谈论党的大事，国家的大事、世界的大事。我从心眼里热爱我们的党和毛主席。不仅中国人民热爱毛主席，全世界一切革命的人民也热爱毛主席。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的受帝国主义和殖民主义迫害的人民，都把毛泽东思想当作翻身求解放的法宝。这是你邓拓污蔑不了的，阻挡不了的。
    邓拓还污蔑我们的大跃进是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”。这纯粹是颠倒黑白，睁着眼睛说黑话。远的不说，就拿我们公社、我们县的事实来说，就足以驳倒邓拓这番黑话。解放前，我们五里亭是个旱死蛤蟆的地方。解放后，党领导我们修水利，特别是一九五八年大跃进以来，我们与全县人民一道修建了长龙水库，使整个公社的土地百分之八十以上实现了灌溉自流化。其他易受干旱的地方，也装上了抽水机。绝大部分土地解除了干旱的威胁，粮食产量连年增加。这不是总路线、大跃进的伟大成就又是什么呢？兴国全县也起了翻天覆地的变化。别的不说，单说医疗卫生事业吧。解放前，兴国只有一所医院。解放后，医疗卫生事业大大发展，大跃进后，建起了崭新的人民医院。现在，社社有卫生所，队队有卫生员，人民的健康得到了可靠的保证。提起医院，就使我更憎恨吃人的旧社会。我的丈夫就是因为在旧社会患肺病无钱进医院，活活地被疾病拖死了。现在，医院是人民的，贫下中农有病可以进人民医院，有困难的，还可以免费治疗。这只有在共产党、毛主席领导的新社会才能办到。
    邓拓闭着眼睛，硬说我们的大跃进是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”，这是别有用心的。邓拓，告诉你，我们红色的江山稳如泰山，坚如磐石，任凭什么妖魔鬼怪兴风作浪，也休想撼动它。我们坚决和一切反党反社会主义分子斗争到底，不铲除黑线，不捣毁黑店，不打垮黑帮，决不收兵。
