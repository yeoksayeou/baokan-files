    The battle of the people of North Vietnam to fight back against American air bandits has achieved brilliant results. As of April 29th, 1,005 American bandit aircraft had been shot down over North Vietnam. This is a great victory for the North Vietnamese people in their struggle to resist America and save the nation, and it is also a common victory for the people of all countries in their struggle against American imperialism. The Chinese people warmly congratulate the people of North Vietnam and salute all the Vietnamese soldiers and civilians who participated in the air defense battles!

    In just over a year, 1,005 American modern aircraft met their fiery end, which strikingly demonstrates the immense power of people's war. Faced with the barbaric invasion of American air bandits, the entire population of North Vietnam mobilized, united as one, forming a surge of enthusiasm for everyone to fight air pirates. The seventeen million people of North Vietnam concentrated their full of hatred for the American aggressors on the muzzles of their artillery and guns. Wherever American aircraft intruded, a network of firepower composed of various weapons appeared. No wonder those American air thieves who luckily escaped, when talking about the "terrifying orange flames" appearing over North Vietnam, changed their color. It can be asserted that the flames of this people's war will burn more American air bandits into ashes.

    The victory of the North Vietnamese military and civilians in shooting down 1,005 American aircraft shattered the myth of American "air superiority," greatly diminished the prestige of the American aggressors, and further exposed the outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature of U.S. imperialism. Facts have proven that neither nuclear weapons nor supersonic, all-weather aircraft are anything but paper tigers. If you don't fight U.S. imperialism, it looks quite frightening. But as long as you are not afraid of it and dare to and are good at fighting it, it reveals its true form. Isn't it a fact that the people of North Vietnam, without a large air force, shot down thousands of American aircraft, which are claimed to be the most modern in the world? Isn't it a fact that ordinary guns and artillery riddled radar-controlled American aircraft equipped with missiles? What determines the outcome of war is not modern weapons, but highly conscious people. This is a universal Marxist truth. It is so in Vietnam, and it is so elsewhere in the world.

    At present, U.S. imperialism is frantically expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam. In addition to massively increasing troops in South Vietnam, its aggression against North Vietnam is becoming increasingly rampant. The bombing by American aircraft has expanded to the outskirts of Hanoi. The amount of bombs dropped by American aircraft is rapidly increasing. American B-52 strategic bombers have been dispatched many times to bomb North Vietnam. The Johnson administration is putting on a fierce and evil pose, which does not at all indicate its strength. On the contrary, the American aggressors in South Vietnam have reached a point where they are in a dilemma. The Johnson administration, like an ant on a hot pot, has no choice but to resort to expanding the war and using the tactic of war blackmail to push forward the conspiracy of "peace talks," in an attempt to find a way to avoid complete annihilation. However, the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism are difficult to succeed. Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, recently reiterated at the Vietnamese National Assembly, "Although the war of resistance will be long and arduous, our people are determined to carry the war of resistance to final victory." We firmly believe that the Vietnamese people will certainly be able to drive all the American aggressors out of the Vietnamese territory, and they will certainly be able to win the complete victory of the cause of independence, unification, and liberation.

    Victory belongs to the Vietnamese people who persevere in their struggle and continue their efforts!

### 美国“空中优势”神话的破产——祝贺越南北方军民对空作战的巨大胜利

    美国“空中优势”神话的破产
    ——祝贺越南北方军民对空作战的巨大胜利
    越南北方人民反击美国空中强盗的战斗，取得了辉煌战绩。到四月二十九日止，已有一千零五架美国强盗飞机在越南北方上空被击落。这是越南北方人民抗美救国斗争的巨大胜利，也是各国人民反对美帝国主义斗争的共同胜利。中国人民热烈地向越南北方人民祝贺，并向参加对空战斗的全体越南军民致敬！
    在一年多的时间里，一千零五架美国现代化飞机葬身火海，这突出地表现了人民战争的巨大威力。面对着美国空中强盗的野蛮入侵，越南北方全民动员，万众一心，形成人人打飞贼的热潮。一千七百万越南北方人民，把他们对美国侵略者的满腔仇恨，凝结在炮口和枪口上。美国飞机闯到那里，那里就出现各种武器组成的火力网。无怪乎那些侥幸漏网的美国飞贼，谈到越南北方上空出现的“可怖的橙色火焰”，就为之色变。可以断言，这一人民战争的火焰，必将把更多的美国空中强盗烧成灰烬。
    越南北方军民打落美国飞机一千零五架的胜利，戳穿了美国“空中优势”的神话，大灭美国侵略者的威风，进一步暴露了美帝国主义外强中干的本质。事实证明，什么核武器也好，什么超音速、全天候飞机也好，都是纸老虎。对于美帝国主义你不打它，它的样子怪吓人。但是，只要不怕它，敢于和善于同它斗，它就露出了原形。事实难道不是，没有庞大空军的越南北方人民，把号称世界上最现代化的美国飞机，成千架的打下来了吗？事实难道不是，普普通通的枪和炮，把雷达操纵的配备有导弹的美国飞机，打得千疮百孔吗？决定战争胜负的，不是现代化的武器，而是高度有觉悟的人。这是一条马克思主义的普遍真理。在越南是如此，在世界其他地方也是如此。
    目前，美帝国主义正在疯狂扩大侵越战争。除了大举增兵南越之外，它对越南北方的侵略，日益猖狂。美国飞机的轰炸，已经扩大到河内的近郊。美国飞机的投弹量，在迅速增加。美国Ｂ—52型战略轰炸机，多次出动轰炸了越南北方。约翰逊政府摆出一副穷凶极恶的架势，丝毫不表明它的强大。恰恰相反，美国侵略者在南越的处境，已经到了进退两难的地步。约翰逊政府如同热锅上的蚂蚁，只好乞灵于扩大战争，并用战争讹诈的手法来推行“和平谈判”的阴谋，妄图找寻一条避免彻底覆灭的出路。但是，美帝国主义的阴谋是难以得逞的。越南民主共和国主席胡志明最近在越南国会上重申，“虽然抗战还长期和艰苦，但是我国人民决心把抗战进行到最后胜利”。我们坚信，越南人民一定能够把美国侵略者全部赶出越南国土，一定能够赢得独立、统一和解放事业的彻底胜利。
    胜利属于再接再厉、坚持斗争的越南人民！
