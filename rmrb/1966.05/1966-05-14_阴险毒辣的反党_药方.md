    Insidious and Vicious Anti-Party "Prescription"
    "Going back on one's word" and "being untrustworthy" are insulting terms and not symptoms at all. The "prescription" Deng Tuo mentions for treating "forgetfulness" cannot be found in the medical books he cites. The "prescription" fabricated by Deng Tuo is a "political prescription." He attempts to overthrow the Communist Party, change our Party's line and policies, restore capitalism, and change the color of our country! We must thoroughly eliminate Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party, anti-socialist so-called "brilliant doctors."

    Deng Tuo's "Yanshan Night Talks" is a big poisonous weed that opposes the Party and opposes socialism. Among them, the article "Specializing in 'Amnesia'" is particularly vicious, a poisoned arrow launched by Deng Tuo with deep hatred against our great Party and our great leader Chairman Mao. Strangely enough, the editorial department of "Frontline" magazine sheltered Deng Tuo in its reply to Comrade Qi Yi in December 1962, suppressing criticism, and saying that "the author wrote this article to address the matter at hand, introducing some relevant situations and knowledge" (see "Guangming Daily," May 9, 1966). This is extremely shameless! Is "Specializing in 'Amnesia'" addressing the matter at hand? Is it introducing medical knowledge? Let's peel back the skin and take a look.
    We are practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine. The "forgetfulness" we usually see clinically only has symptoms such as insomnia, fatigue, and backache. Words such as "going back on one's word," "being untrustworthy," "feigning madness," and "being unworthy of trust" are all insulting terms and not symptoms at all. "Aizi Houyu" is not a medical book at all. The "Zhongguo Congshu Zonglu" classifies it as fiction, and some even classify it as "Lidai Xiaohua Ji" (Collection of Jokes of Past Dynasties). Lu Zhuo, the author of "Aizi Houyu" himself, said in the preface: "Everyone knows that Aizi is the playful writing of Su Dongpo, but they do not know that he created it for a purpose. ... Su Dongpo often used words and writings to criticize current politics." It can be seen that "Aizi Houyu" is a political satirical essay, and does not mention a "typical case of forgetfulness" at all.
    Deng Tuo also posed as a "scholar," quoting materials from ancient Chinese medical books such as "Sheng Hui Fang," "Ling Shu," and "Su Wen," attempting to deceive readers. However, his methods are clumsy, and his fox tail is too long. In medicine, it is never said that forgetfulness will develop into madness or idiocy. We have searched the entire text of "Ling Shu" and found no record of "polarization" of forgetfulness. There was no book called "Sheng Hui Fang" in the Ming Dynasty at all. We have searched the "Sheng Hui Fang" of the Song Dynasty and found neither the "Bajitian Wan" nor the "Danshen Yinzi" formulas. These two formulas mainly contain drugs that resolve phlegm and clear the heart. Obviously, Deng Tuo's "prescription" is a "political prescription," an insinuation of our Party, scolding our Party by comparing it to a patient whose mind is clouded by phlegm and is mentally confused.
    Deng Tuo is venting his bitter hatred for the Party through treatment methods. He wants to pour a basin of dog blood over the "patient's" head and use a specially made club to strike the "patient's" head, causing him to go into shock. This is not only the same as the language used by right-wing opportunists to hate and slander our Party, but it is simply trying to beat proletarian revolutionary fighters to death with one blow. What a vicious idea! As if that weren't enough, Deng Tuo wrote at the end of the article, "It is necessary to invite brilliant doctors to guide." The so-called "brilliant doctors" are Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party, anti-socialist elements who would come to power after the Communist Party is overthrown, and everything would be arranged according to their wishes, according to their anti-Party, anti-socialist program, changing our Party's line and policies, implementing capitalist restoration, and changing the color of our country! What a poisonous "prescription" this is!
    If there is poisonous weed, it must be completely eradicated. We must creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, sharpen our eyes, throw ourselves into the socialist cultural revolution, and wage a resolute struggle against the class enemies, and never stop until complete victory!

    阴险毒辣的反党“药方”
    “自食其言”“言而无信”是骂人的字眼，根本不成其为症状。从邓拓举出的医书上，也根本找不到他所说的医治“健忘症”的药方。邓拓编造的药方是“政治药方”。他妄图把共产党打下台，改变我们党的路线和方针政策，让资本主义复辟，使我们的国家变颜色！我们一定要把邓拓这伙反党反社会主义的所谓“高明的医师”彻底清除掉。
    上海中医学院伤寒温病教研组助教　柯雪帆　刘嘉湘
    邓拓的《燕山夜话》是一株反党反社会主义的大毒草。其中《专治“健忘症”》一文尤为恶毒，是邓拓怀着刻骨的仇恨，向我们伟大的党、伟大的领袖毛主席发射的一支毒箭。奇怪得很，《前线》杂志编辑部在一九六二年十二月给戚益同志的复信中却包庇邓拓，压制批评，说什么“作者写这篇文章，是就事论事，介绍一些有关的情况和知识”（见一九六六年五月九日《光明日报》）。真是厚颜无耻到极点！《专治“健忘症”》是就事论事吗？是介绍医学知识吗？不妨剥开皮来看一看。
    我们是中医，平时在临床上所看到的“健忘症”只有失眠、疲倦、腰痠等症状，所谓“自食其言”、“言而无信”、“装疯卖傻”、“不堪信任”等字眼都是骂人的字眼，根本不成其为症状，明明是邓拓反党反社会主义的黑话。《艾子后语》根本不是一本医书。《中国丛书综录》把它编入小说类，也有人把它编入《历代笑话集》。《艾子后语》的作者陆灼自己在序言中说：“世皆知艾子为坡翁戏笔，而不知其有为作也。……坡翁平日，好以言语文章规切时政。”可见《艾子后语》是一本政治讽刺小品文，哪里谈得上记载了“健忘症的一个典型病例”。
    邓拓还摆出了“学者”的样子，摘引了《圣惠方》、《灵枢》、《素问》等中医古代医书中的材料，企图欺骗读者。可是，他的手法拙劣，狐狸尾巴拖得很长。医学上从来没有健忘会发展成为疯狂、发展成为傻子的论述。我们翻遍《灵枢》全文，也没有健忘症“两极化”的记载。明代根本没有《圣惠方》这本书，我们翻遍了宋代《圣惠方》，也没有“巴戟天丸”和“丹参饮子”这两个方子。这两个方子里主要是化痰清心的药物。显然，邓拓开出这些药方是“政治药方”，是影射我们党的，把我们党比作痰迷心窍、神志不清的病人来辱骂。
    邓拓借治疗方法，发泄它对党的切齿仇恨，要用一盆狗血，从“病人”的头上淋下去，用一根特制的棍棒，打击“病人”的头部，使之休克。这不但同右倾机会主义者仇恨和诬蔑我们党的语言一模一样，而且简直要想把无产阶级革命战士一棍子打死。这是多么狠毒的主意！这还不够，邓拓在文章的结尾处又写下“需要请高明的医师指导”。所谓“高明的医师”，就是把共产党打下台以后，由邓拓他们那伙反党反社会主义分子上台，一切听从他们的摆布，按照他们反党反社会主义的纲领办事，改变我们党的路线方针政策，实行资本主义复辟，使我们的国家改变颜色！这是一帖何等毒辣的“药方”啊！
    有毒草就得把它彻底铲除。我们一定要活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，擦亮自己的眼睛，投入社会主义文化大革命，和阶级敌人作坚决斗争，不获全胜，决不收兵！
