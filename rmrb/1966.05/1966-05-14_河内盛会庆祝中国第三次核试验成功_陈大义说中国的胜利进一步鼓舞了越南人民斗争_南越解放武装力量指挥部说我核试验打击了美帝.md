    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 13th - Over 1,200 representatives from all walks of life in Hanoi held a grand rally at the Labor Club on the evening of the 12th to warmly celebrate the successful third nuclear explosion in China.

    The celebration rally was presided over by Huang Guo-yue, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front and President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association.

    Chen Deyi, Director of the Vietnam State Committee of Science and Technology, spoke at the meeting. He said, "China's possession of increasingly sophisticated nuclear weapons plays a significant role in defending China, opposing the aggression and war schemes of US imperialism, supporting the national independence struggles of the people of all countries, and smashing the nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail of imperialism headed by the United States. At the same time, it is also a positive contribution to safeguarding world peace."

    He said, "The glorious victory of the Chinese people in successfully conducting the nuclear test is a tremendous encouragement to the entire army and people of both North and South Vietnam who are resisting the American bandits. The Vietnamese people are extremely happy about this great victory of the fraternal Chinese people and regard the Chinese people's victory as their own."

    He pointed out that the success of China's nuclear explosion marks a new leap forward in China's atomic science and technology, and it also proves that China's development path in atomic science and technology is correct and full of creativity. China's increasingly sophisticated nuclear tests, conducted three times in less than twenty months, also demonstrate the comprehensive and powerful development of China's national economy and socialist construction.

    He emphasized that the success of China's three nuclear tests "is a glorious victory achieved under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by the esteemed Chairman Mao Zedong, and it is also a glorious victory in which the 650 million Chinese people, constantly enhancing their revolutionary spirit and self-reliance, wholeheartedly serve the Chinese and world revolution, and highly demonstrate their strength and wisdom."

    He concluded by saying that China's nuclear explosion this time, containing thermonuclear materials, further encourages the entire Vietnamese people's determination to defeat the American aggressors, defend the North, liberate the South, and advance towards the reunification of the motherland.

    After Chen Deyi's speech, the audience enthusiastically shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live President Ho!" "Long live the militant unity and friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China!"

    Zhu Qiwu, Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam, and Cao Yanxing, representative of the Chinese Economic Representative Office in Vietnam, also attended the meeting.

    Xinhua News Agency, May 13th - Lin Biao, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense, received a telegram from the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces Command congratulating China on the successful nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials. The text of the telegram is as follows: To Comrade Lin Biao, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China:

    Having learned that the People's Republic of China has successfully conducted a nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials, we, on behalf of all the commanders and fighters of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces, extend our warmest congratulations to you and, through you, to all the commanders and fighters of the fraternal Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    The new achievement of China's nuclear test is a brilliant victory of the leadership line of the Chinese Communist Party and a symbol of the greatest development of China's national defense and scientific and technological undertakings. It is a direct and heavy blow to the US imperialist policy of nuclear blackmail, and it makes a great contribution to strengthening the forces fighting against imperialism and colonialism, and it is also a reliable guarantee for safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

    This new victory of China is an incomparably great encouragement to the people of South Vietnam and the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces, who are determined to defeat the American aggressors and their lackeys, to thoroughly liberate South Vietnam, defend North Vietnam, and peacefully reunify their beloved motherland.

    We wish the fraternal Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by the esteemed Chairman Mao, to achieve more, greater, and more brilliant victories in strengthening and consolidating national defense and building a prosperous and happy country.

    新华社河内十三日电 河内市各界代表一千二百多人，十二日晚上在劳动俱乐部举行盛大集会，热烈庆祝中国第三次核爆炸成功。
    庆祝大会由越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团委员、越中友好协会会长黄国越主持。
    越南国家科学技术委员会主任陈大义在会上讲了话。他说，“中国拥有日益完善的核武器，对保卫中国、反对美帝国主义的侵略和战争阴谋、支援各国人民的民族独立斗争、粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义的核垄断和核讹诈起着重大作用。同时，也是对保卫世界和平的积极贡献”。
    他说，“中国人民成功地进行核试验的辉煌胜利，是对正在抗击美国强盗的越南南北两方全体军民的巨大鼓舞。越南人民对兄弟的中国人民的这一巨大胜利感到万分高兴，并把中国人民的胜利看作是自己的胜利。”
    他指出，中国这次核爆炸成功，标志着中国原子科学技术迈出了跃进的新的一步，它也证明中国原子科学技术的发展路线是正确的和充满创造性的。中国在不到二十个月的时间内日益完善地进行了三次核试验，还说明中国国民经济和社会主义建设事业的全面和强大的发展。
    他强调指出，中国三次核试验的成功，“是在以敬爱的毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党英明领导下取得的辉煌胜利，也是不断地提高革命精神和自力更生精神、全心全意为中国和世界革命服务的六亿五千万中国人民高度发挥自己的力量和智慧的辉煌胜利。”
    他最后说，中国这次进行的含有热核材料的核爆炸，更进一步地鼓舞了全体越南人民决心打败美国侵略者、保卫北方、解放南方、进而统一祖国的斗争。
    陈大义讲话后，全场热烈欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“胡主席万岁！”“越中两国人民的战斗团结和友谊万岁！”
    中国驻越南大使朱其文和中国驻越南经济代表处代表曹言行也出席了大会。
    新华社十三日讯　国务院副总理兼国防部长林彪收到了越南南方解放武装力量指挥部发来的祝贺我国成功地进行含有热核材料的核爆炸的电报，电文如下：中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼国防部长林彪：
    获悉中华人民共和国成功地进行了含有热核材料的核爆炸，我们谨代表越南南方解放武装力量全体指战员，向您并通过您向兄弟的中国人民解放军全体指战员，表示最热烈的祝贺。
    中国这次核试验的新成就，是中国共产党领导路线的辉煌胜利，是中国国防和科技事业获得最大发展的标志，是对美帝国主义核讹诈政策的一次直接的沉重的打击，对加强为反帝反殖而斗争的力量作出了巨大的贡献，也是对保卫亚洲和世界和平的一个可靠保证。
    中国这一新的胜利，对为彻底解放越南南方，保卫北方，和平统一自己亲爱的祖国而坚决战胜美国侵略者及其走狗的越南南方人民和越南南方解放武装力量，是一个无比巨大的鼓舞。
    祝兄弟的中国人民和中国人民解放军，在以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党的英明领导下，在加强和巩固国防，建设繁荣幸福的国家中，取得更多、更大、更加辉煌的胜利。
