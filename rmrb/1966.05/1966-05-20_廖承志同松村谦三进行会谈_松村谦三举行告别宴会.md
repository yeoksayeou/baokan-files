    Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Liao Chengzhi and Matsumura Kenzō held talks regarding the Liao Chengzhi-Takasaki Tatsunosuke Memorandum Trade. Both parties unanimously agreed to the following three points:
    One, both parties principally agreed that the Liao Chengzhi-Takasaki Tatsunosuke Memorandum Trade, from 1963 to 1967, should continue.
    Two, both parties agreed that next year, Mr. Okazaki Kaheita, the person in charge of the Takasaki Tatsunosuke Office, will go to Beijing to discuss specific arrangements regarding the Memorandum Trade.
    Three, if unforeseen circumstances occur, both parties agree to maintain contact at any time.
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Matsumura Kenzō, advisor to the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, held a farewell banquet this evening.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi was invited to attend the banquet.
    Matsumura Kenzō spoke at the banquet. He said, "During my one-week visit to China, I have been treated so well by my Chinese friends, which makes me sincerely happy. China and Japan should join hands and embark on the path of common prosperity." Matsumura Kenzō said, "During my stay in China, I had friendly conversations with the Chinese side on all issues. Thank you to China for your kindness."
    Liao Chengzhi said in his speech that Mr. Matsumura Kenzō's visit to China this time has made an important contribution to promoting friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and non-governmental trade between the two countries. Liao Chengzhi said, "Mr. Matsumura once said to me that he is a Japanese politician and does not want to speak ill of the Japanese Prime Minister in front of foreigners. In my opinion, the person whose faults Mr. Matsumura does not wish to speak about would be doing well to learn even one percent from Mr. Matsumura."
    Liao Chengzhi said, "Mr. Matsumura is right: the masses and the people are on our side. Therefore, no matter what obstacles there are, we can overcome them and we will definitely be able to continue to move forward." He concluded by proposing a toast to the development of the Liao Chengzhi-Takasaki Tatsunosuke Memorandum Trade.
    Hu Yuzhi, Qiao Guanhua, Nan Hanchen, Chu Tunan, Zhang Youyu, Cui Yueli, Liu Xiwu, Huan Xiang, Zhao Anbo and others were invited to attend the banquet.
    Koichi Saiyuenji, a Japanese peace activist in Beijing, also attended the banquet. (Attached picture)

    廖承志同松村谦三进行会谈
    松村谦三举行告别宴会
    新华社十九日讯　廖承志同松村谦三就廖承志、高碕达之助备忘录贸易进行了会谈，双方一致同意如下三点：
    一、双方原则上同意自一九六三年到一九六七年的廖承志、高碕达之助备忘录贸易继续进行。
    二、双方同意明年由高碕达之助办事处负责人冈崎嘉平太先生到北京商谈有关备忘录贸易的具体安排问题。
    三、如果发生预料不到的情况，双方同意随时进行接触。
    新华社十九日讯　日本自由民主党顾问松村谦三，今晚举行告别宴会。
    陈毅副总理应邀出席了宴会。
    松村谦三在宴会上讲话。他说，在访问中国的一个星期中，我得到了中国朋友这样好的款待，使我衷心感到高兴。中日两国应携起手来，走共同繁荣的道路。松村谦三说，在中国逗留期间，我同中国方面就一切问题进行了友好的交谈。感谢中国对我的好意。
    廖承志在讲话中说，这次松村谦三先生访问中国，对促进中日两国人民友好和两国民间贸易作出了重要贡献。廖承志说，松村先生曾对我说，他是日本的政治家，不愿意在外国人面前讲日本首相的坏话。据我看，松村先生不愿讲他坏话的那个人，如果能学到松村先生的百分之一就不错了。
    廖承志说，松村先生讲得好，民众、人民是站在我们一边的，因此，不管有什么障碍，我们都能够战胜，一定能继续前进。他最后提议为廖承志、高碕达之助备忘录贸易的发展干杯。
