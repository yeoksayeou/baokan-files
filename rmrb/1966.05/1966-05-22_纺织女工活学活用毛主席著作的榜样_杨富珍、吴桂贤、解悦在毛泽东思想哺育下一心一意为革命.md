    Textile workers learn and apply Chairman Mao's writings:
    Yang Fuzhen, Wu Guixian, and Jie Yue wholeheartedly serve the revolution under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought
    According to Xinhua News Agency, May 19th - Three generations of female workers on China's textile industrial front use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to continuously win victories in transforming both the subjective world and the objective world, constantly radiating light and heat for socialist construction.
    They have set a good example for more than one million textile workers nationwide in learning and applying Chairman Mao's writings in a living way. The recently concluded National Textile Industry Work Conference and Political Work Conference commended them and invited them to give reports at the conference.
    These three generations of female workers are Yang Fuzhen, a weaving machine operator from Shanghai State-owned No. 1 Cotton Mill; Wu Guixian, a spinning machine operator from Northwest State-owned No. 1 Cotton Mill; and Jie Yue, a spinning machine operator from Taiyuan Textile Mill.
    They joined the ranks of textile workers successively during three different historical periods in China's textile industry. Yang Fuzhen is an old worker from before liberation, Wu Guixian is a worker who joined the factory in the early days of the People's Republic of China, and Jie Yue is a young worker who entered the factory in 1958. These three female workers represent three generations of China's textile industry, and their struggles and growth are actually an epitome of the struggles and growth of Chinese textile workers.
    Although the experiences of these three generations of textile workers are different, under the guidance and nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought, they have a common revolutionary ideal—to wholeheartedly spin and weave for the revolution and for the people. They all use Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon to transform their subjective thoughts and the objective world.
    Yang Fuzhen
    We do things according to what Chairman Mao says, and everything goes well, everything is understood, and everything is effective.
    Yang Fuzhen, this orphan who lost both parents at a young age in the old society, was forced by livelihood to come to the dark old Shanghai at the age of fourteen, and entered a textile factory at the age of fifteen, suffering the exploitation and oppression of capitalists. After liberation, her deep class feelings made her feel like a fish in water as soon as she started reading Chairman Mao's writings. She said, "The more I read, the more I feel that Chairman Mao's words are absolutely true. Chairman Mao's books are all written for us working people, and they all speak the words in the hearts of our working class. When we do things according to what Chairman Mao says, everything goes well, everything is understood, and everything is effective." Yang Fuzhen is doing revolution conscientiously according to Chairman Mao's teachings. She said: "We weave cloth for 650 million people, for the cause of revolution. This is the glory of our textile workers... We are not only weaving cloth, but also weaving the ambition of Chinese textile workers. We are weaving cloth for the revolution. The more cloth we weave, the better, which is a greater contribution to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution." Practice has proved that Yang Fuzhen keeps the revolution in her heart and weaves her heart into the cloth. Since 1953, she has overfulfilled the state plan every month for thirteen consecutive years, and there are very few defective cloths.
    Yang Fuzhen has a famous saying: To catch the defects on the cloth surface, we must first catch the defects in our minds. This is a profound truth she summed up after repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's writings.
    This underground party member who joined the party on the eve of the liberation of Shanghai often demands herself with thorough and complete service to the people. When accepting tasks, she rushes to take on heavy burdens; when encountering difficulties, she stands up to fight. Once, the factory leadership broke the old rule of allowing defective cloth within eleven inches to be removed, which had been in place for more than ten years, and proposed to remove less defective cloth and produce more good cloth, while testing it on the loom watched by Yang Fuzhen. At the beginning, she produced some defective cloth because she had no experience. At that time, the factory was carrying out a competition of ten thousand meters of defect-free cloth, and her name was not on the honor roll, and some people around her also said some sarcastic remarks. At this difficult juncture, Yang Fuzhen thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "This team of ours is entirely for the liberation of the people, and it works thoroughly for the interests of the people." She thought, if the people want me to do the experiment, I will experiment to the end, even if there are great difficulties, I will go up. To be complete and thorough, there must be no selfishness. Working for the people means that even if my name is never on the honor roll in my life, I am willing. Because she insisted on experimenting and constantly summed up experience, she found the law of weaving, and as a result, the woven cloth was good inch by inch, and she explored a set of experiences for producing defect-free cloth.
    Yang Fuzhen's production practice vividly shows that only by highlighting politics, taking Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, and eliminating the ideological defects of individualism, can we eliminate defects in production, and can we achieve something and create something.
    Wu Guixian
    The red flag must be carried by people, and this person must be armed with Mao Zedong Thought.
    Wu Guixian is the party group leader of the Zhao Mengtao Group in Northwest State-owned No. 1 Cotton Mill. In the fourteen years since entering the factory, she has become an advanced textile worker from an ignorant child under the cultivation of the Party.
    In 1963, after the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China named their group Zhao Mengtao Group, Zhao Mengtao passed away due to illness in less than two months. How to take on the heavy responsibility of leading this red flag group that has maintained an advanced record for ten consecutive years? As the party group leader, Wu Guixian felt that she had a heavy burden on her shoulders.
    Wu Guixian relived Chairman Mao's teaching: "Hard work is like a burden, placed in front of us, to see if we dare to bear it. Burdens are light and heavy. Some people pick the easy ones and are afraid of the heavy ones, pushing the heavy burdens to others and picking the light ones for themselves. This is not a good attitude." Chairman Mao's teachings dispelled Wu Guixian's fear of difficulties and hesitation. She was determined to lead all the comrades in the group to carry this red flag to communism without changing shoulders or resting.
    Chairman Mao said: "Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to carry out great political struggles. If this task is not resolved, all the political tasks of the party cannot be completed." Wu Guixian followed Chairman Mao's teachings and was determined to start with mastering the central link of ideological education in the group. She believed that in order to make all comrades in the group understand that carrying the red flag is not carrying other red flags, but carrying the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. The red flag must be carried by people, and this person must be armed with Mao Zedong Thought.
    Therefore, she mobilized everyone in the group to recall and compare, and carry out vivid class education. Some female workers also examined their forgetful thoughts and expressed that they must study Chairman Mao's writings well in the future, arm their minds, and resist the erosion of bourgeois ideology.
    The Zhao Mengtao Group has a very good tradition of not letting a partner fall behind. When Zhao Mengtao was alive, she took the initiative to give up good cars seven times in order to allow backward comrades to catch up. The current group leaders also did the same. However, after studying Chairman Mao's writings, they realized that simply changing cars cannot solve the fundamental problem. Only by keeping the masses' thoughts from falling behind and closely following Mao Zedong Thought can the problem be fundamentally solved and can the enthusiasm and creativity of every comrade in the group be fully mobilized. Therefore, they now focus more on ideological education and help backward workers improve their technical level. At present, this group is not only at the forefront of production, but also the benchmark for political and ideological work in the entire factory.
    Jie Yue
    According to Chairman Mao's teachings, things can only be done well by following objective laws.
    Jie Yue, a young worker from Taiyuan Textile Mill, is a representative of textile workers who learn and apply Chairman Mao's philosophical thought in a living way. In the practice of production struggle, she studied and applied Chairman Mao's philosophical thought, worked practically, studied practically, and pioneered practically. She initially recognized and mastered the objective laws of spinning splicing work, enabling her to "fly" her ability to watch spindles to 1,600 spindles, creating a set of advanced operating methods, and reaching the national advanced level in just a few years.
    When Jie Yue recently talked about her experience in studying Chairman Mao's writings, she said: "Chairman Mao taught us that everything in the world develops according to laws, and things can only be done well by recognizing objective laws and acting according to objective laws. I think splicing also has its objective laws. If you don't recognize it, don't master it, how can you not feel awkward when operating? Originally, the operating method is a summary of others mastering objective laws, but because I did not recognize objective laws and did not act according to objective laws, even if there is an operating method, I only know what it is, but don't know why it is so, let alone create and progress." After finding the problem, she was determined to summarize experience from practice, find out the law of splicing, and turn the subjective desire for defect-free splicing into an objective reality.
    The three female textile generals, holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, have made outstanding achievements for the revolution and the people, and have been praised by the leaders and comrades. But they kept in mind Chairman Mao's teaching: "Modesty helps one to progress, while conceit makes one lag behind", and guaranteed that they would not be satisfied with existing achievements, but would read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime and carry the red flag for a lifetime.

### 纺织女工活学活用毛主席著作的榜样  杨富珍、吴桂贤、解悦在毛泽东思想哺育下一心一意为革命

    纺织女工活学活用毛主席著作的榜样
    杨富珍、吴桂贤、解悦在毛泽东思想哺育下一心一意为革命
    据新华社十九日讯　我国纺织工业战线上的三代女工都以毛泽东思想为武器，在改造主观世界和改造客观世界方面不断地打胜仗，不断地为社会主义建设发着光和热。
    她们活学活用毛主席著作，为全国一百多万纺织工人树立了好榜样。最近结束的全国纺织工业工作会议和政治工作会议表扬了她们，并且请她们在会上作了报告。
    这三代女工是上海国棉一厂织布挡车工杨富珍，西北国棉一厂细纱挡车工吴桂贤和太原纺织厂细纱挡车工解悦。
    她们三人是在我国纺织工业三个不同历史时期，先后加入纺织工人队伍的。杨富珍是解放前的老工人，吴桂贤是新中国成立初期入厂的工人，而解悦是一九五八年进厂的青年工人。这三位女工代表了我国纺织工业的三代人，她们的斗争和成长过程实际上是我国纺织工人斗争和成长过程的缩影。
    这三代纺织女工的经历尽管不同，但是在伟大的毛泽东思想教导和哺育下，却有着共同的革命理想——一心一意为革命为人民纺纱织布。她们都用毛泽东思想作为改造主观思想和客观世界的强大武器。
    杨富珍
    我们照毛主席的话去做，一做就好，百做百通，百用百灵
    杨富珍，这位在旧社会从幼就丧失双亲的孤女，为生计所迫，十四岁就来到了当时暗无天日的旧上海，十五岁进了纺织厂，受尽了资本家的剥削和压迫。解放后，深厚的阶级感情使她一读上毛主席著作，就象鱼儿得了水。她说：“越读越觉得毛主席的话是千真万确的。毛主席的书都是为我们劳动人民写的，讲的都是我们工人阶级的心里话。我们照毛主席的话去做，一做就好，百做百通，百用百灵。”杨富珍就是踏踏实实地按毛主席的教导干革命的。她说：“我们织布是为六亿五千万人民织的，是为革命事业织的，这是我们纺织工人的光荣。……我们织的不仅是布，而是织的中国纺织工人的志气，是为革命而织布。我们织的布越多越好，就是对中国革命和世界革命的贡献越大。”实践证明了杨富珍是把革命记在心上，把心织在布上的。从一九五三年以来，她连续十三年月月都超额完成国家计划，而且很少出疵布。
    杨富珍有一句名言：要捉掉布面上的疵点，先要捉掉思想上的疵点。这是她反复学习毛主席著作后总结出一条深刻的道理。
    这位在上海解放前夕入党的地下党员，经常以彻底、完全为人民服务来要求自己。接受任务时，她抢着去挑重担子；碰到困难时，挺起腰杆去斗争。有一次，厂领导打破十多年来允许拆十一吋以内疵布的老规矩，提出少拆疵布，多出好布的要求，同时要在杨富珍看管的布机上试验。开始因为她没有经验，出了一些疵布。当时厂里正在开展万米无疵布的竞赛，光荣榜上没有了她的名字，周围有些人也讲了一些冷嘲热讽的话。在这个进退两难的关头，杨富珍想起了毛主席的教导：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”她想，人民要我做试验，我就要把它试验到底，就是有天大的困难，也要上。要完全、彻底，就要没有一点私心。为人民做工作，就是光荣榜上一辈子没有我的名字，我也心甘情愿。由于她坚持试验，不断总结经验，找到了织布规律，结果织出来的布寸寸是好布，摸索出了一套不出疵布的经验。
    杨富珍的生产实践生动表明，只有突出政治，以毛泽东思想作统帅，清除个人主义的思想疵点，才能在生产上消灭疵点，才能有所作为，有所创造。
    吴桂贤
    红旗要人来扛，这个人必须是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人
    吴桂贤是西北国棉一厂赵梦桃小组的党小组长。进厂十四年来，她在党的培养下，从不懂事的孩子成为先进的纺织工人。
    一九六三年中共陕西省委以赵梦桃名字命名她们的小组为赵梦桃小组后，不到两个月，赵梦桃同志因病逝世了。这个连续保持了十年先进纪录的红旗小组的领导重担，怎么挑起来？作为党小组长的吴桂贤，感到自己肩上有千斤重。
    吴桂贤重温了毛主席的教导：“艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。担子有轻有重。有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好的态度。”毛主席的教导，解除了吴桂贤的畏难犹豫情绪。她决心领导全小组同志，把这面红旗不换肩、不歇气地扛到共产主义，一直扛下去。
    毛主席说：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”吴桂贤遵循毛主席的教导，决心从掌握好小组思想教育这一中心环节着手。她认为要使全小组同志人人懂得扛红旗，不是扛别的红旗，而是扛毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。红旗要人来扛，这个人必须是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。
    于是，她在小组里发动大家回忆对比，进行生动的阶级教育。有些女工还检查了自己的忘本思想，表示今后一定要学好毛主席著作，武装自己头脑，抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀。
    赵梦桃小组有个很好的传统，就是不让一个伙伴掉队。赵梦桃在世时，她曾七次主动让好车，为的是让后进同志跟上来。现在的小组领导成员也照样做了。但是，她们学习了毛主席著作，认识到光换车不能解决根本问题。只有让群众思想不掉队，紧紧跟上毛泽东思想，才能根本解决问题，才能充分调动小组每个同志的积极性和创造性。因此，她们现在更多地是从思想教育工作着手，帮助后进工人提高技术水平。目前，这个小组不仅生产是名列前茅，小组的政治思想工作也是全厂的标兵。
    解悦
    遵照毛主席教导，按客观规律办事，事情才能办好
    太原纺织厂的青年工人解悦，是纺织工人活学活用毛主席哲学思想的代表。她在生产斗争的实际中，学习和运用毛主席的哲学思想，实干，实学，实闯，初步认识和掌握了纺纱接头工作的客观规律，使自己看锭能力“飞”上了一千六百纱锭，创造了一套先进的操作法，在短短几年之内，达到了全国先进水平。
    解悦最近在谈到她学习毛主席著作体会的时候说：“毛主席教导我们，世界上万事万物都是有规律地发展的，只有认识客观规律，按客观规律办事，事情才能办好。我想，接头也有它的客观规律。不认识它，不掌握它，操作起来怎么不别扭呢？本来，操作法是别人驾驭客观规律的总结，可是由于我没有认识客观规律，不按客观规律办事，即使有了操作法，也只是知其然，而不知其所以然，更谈不到有所创造，有所前进了。”找到了毛病，她就下决心从实践中去总结经验，把接头的规律摸出来，使接头无疵点的主观愿望变成客观现实。
    三位纺织女将高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为革命为人民作出了出色的成绩，受到了领导的表扬，同志们的赞称。但是她们牢记毛主席的教导：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”，保证不满足既有的成绩，要读一辈子毛主席的书，扛一辈子红旗。
