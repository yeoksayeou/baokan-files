    Read Chairman Mao's Books, Follow the Revolutionary Road
    We want to read, but we want to read Chairman Mao's books; we want to follow a road, but we want to follow the road of proletarian revolution.

    Our young people yearn for knowledge, and Deng Tuo believes this is an opportunity to exploit, posing as a "scholar," "celebrity," and a "polymath" proficient in all kinds of knowledge. In the guise of caring for young people as a "mentor of youth," he disseminated a large amount of poison to them. He said:

      Young people, don't you cherish your life? "Then, we must seize the opportunity now, while we are young, and hurry up and read." (See "Read Books Quickly") "The reason why I want to use the night time to have such conversations with my readers is merely to draw everyone's attention to cherishing this one-third of life." (See "One-Third of Life")

      Young people, do you want to become a knowledgeable person? Then, you should "seize the important works that suit your needs, even if it's only one or two, and read them thoroughly... the more the better. Over time, your knowledge will inevitably become richer..." This is a "common path" for young people. (See "Common Path")

    Young people, if you leave school and cannot continue your studies, then "I think she should study at home systematically. Since ancient times, countless famous scholars have succeeded through self-study." (See "Self-Study and Family Tradition")
    Etc., etc.

    This is the "common path" that Deng Tuo pointed out to young people. Here, there is no proletarian politics, no socialist revolution, no needs of the Party, no service to the people, and even less communist ideals... So, what kind of "common path" is this? Very clearly, it is a "path" of individual struggle. Here, there is only "one's own needs," "one's own knowledge," and "famous scholars," only the bourgeois and feudalistic desire to rise above others, to achieve personal fame, and to gain personal benefit. This is a thorough bourgeois individualistic road, a non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary road!

    Deng Tuo was afraid that people would not believe that this was a feasible path, so he went on to list many precedents, "calling" on young people to learn from them. He said: "The fact that this young man later became a famous scholar was by no means accidental. If our young readers today can learn from Wang Chong's spirit and study diligently, what's wrong with that?"
  (See "Is This a Good Phenomenon") There are also Qin Shi Huang, Lü Si Li, Zhao Pu, Jing Qing, Wang Yuyang... It can be said that there were examples in the past. And the current "polymath" gentlemen are the contemporary "famous scholars," so it can be said that there are successors in the present.

    In fact, it's more than just a few. Deng Tuo just didn't say it. Those right-wingers and right-leaning opportunists are the "promising" people in Deng Tuo's mind. Deng Tuo was too embarrassed to compliment them, afraid of losing face if he said it outright.

    So, let's evaluate this group of "scholars" and "celebrities" that Deng Tuo "explicitly" and "implicitly" praised. How much weight do they really carry? Qin Shi Huang, a brutal emperor, a local tyrant; Lü Si Li, a feudal official, the lackey of landlords; Zhao Pu, an accomplice of the conspirator Zhao Kuangyin; even Jing Qing and Wang Yuyang were nothing more than feudal apologists and feudal literati, who, either openly or secretly, lightly or heavily, acted as pawns of feudalism. Is there a single good one among them? No. As for the bourgeois rightists, right-leaning opportunists, and your "Three-Family Village" brothers that you keep silent about, what are they? What have they done? You are anti-Party and anti-socialist conspirators, lackeys of imperialism, accomplices of revisionism, and criminals against the people. You have committed unforgivable sins!

    How high-sounding: "reading," "learning," "knowledge," "scholarship"! What books to read? Who to learn from? What to do with knowledge? What a beautiful coat: "scholars," "celebrities," "polymaths"! Whose "scholars"? "Celebrities" for what? "Polymaths" appointed by whom? All of this is a trick, a smokescreen, a bait! To put it bluntly, it is to make us go with you to oppose the Party and oppose socialism, to engage in counter-revolutionary activities!

    Yes, we want to read, but we want to read Chairman Mao's books; we want to follow a road, but we want to follow the road of proletarian revolution. This is the conclusion.

    The direction of revolutionary youth has long been clear, and the road has long been chosen. Chairman Mao pointed out as early as 1939: "How do we judge whether a youth is a revolutionary? …How can we tell whether one is a revolutionary? There can only be one criterion, namely, whether or not he is willing to integrate himself with the broad masses of workers and peasants and does so in practice." "...If today he integrates himself with the masses of workers and peasants, then today he is a revolutionary; if tomorrow he ceases to do so or turns round to oppress the common people, then he is no longer a revolutionary or becomes a counter-revolutionary." (See "The Orientation of the Youth Movement") Now Chairman Mao is calling on us to go to the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment to weather the storms and face the world. You, Deng Tuo, have come out to obstruct us, attempting to lead young people astray. I tell you: you will never succeed!

    读毛主席的书，走革命道路
    我们要读书，但我们要读的是毛主席的书；我们要走一条路，但我们要走的是无产阶级革命的道路
    中国戏曲研究院　贺兰玉
    我们青年人渴望着求知识，邓拓认为这是一个可乘之机，俨然摆出一个“学者”、“名流”和精通各种知识的“杂家”姿态，以关心青年的“青年的导师”身份向青年们散布了大量的毒素。他说：
      青年人，你不珍惜自己的生命吗？“那末，我们现在就要趁着年青的时候，抓紧机会，赶快读书。”（见《有书赶快读》）“我之所以想利用夜晚的时间，向读者同志们做这样的谈话，目的也不过是要引起大家注意珍惜这三分之一的生命。”（见《生命的三分之一》）
      青年人，你要成为一个有学问的人吗？那末，你就“抓住适合自己需要的重要的著作，哪怕只有一两本也行，把它读得烂熟……越多越好。这样日久天长，自己的知识必然会丰富起来……”这就是青年们“共通的门径”。（见《共通的门径》）
    青年人，如果你一旦离开了学校不能继续读书的话，那末，“我以为她应该有计划地在家自学。古来不知有多少著名的学者都是自学成功的。”（见《自学与家传》）
    等等，等等。
    这就是邓拓给青年们指出的一条“共通的门径”。在这里，没有无产阶级政治，没有社会主义革命，没有党的需要，没有为人民服务，更没有共产主义理想……那末，这是一条什么样的“共通的门径”呢？很清楚，个人奋斗的“门径”。在这里，只有“自己的需要”、“自己的知识”和“著名的学者”，只有资产阶级和封建主义的出人头地、成个人之名，得个人之利。这是一条道道地地的资产阶级个人主义道路，不革命或者反革命的道路！
    邓拓唯恐人们不相信这是一条可行的路，接着列举了很多先例，“号召”青年们向他们学习。他说：“这个青年人后来成了一位著名的学者，就决不是偶然的。我们现在的青年读者，如果能够学习王充的精神，勤苦读书，又有什么不好呢？”
  （见《这是不是好现象》）还有秦始皇、吕思礼、赵普、景清、王渔洋……可以说，前有古人。而现在的“杂家”先生们就是当代的“著名的学者”，可说是，今有来者。
    其实，何止寥寥数者。不过邓拓没有说出罢了。那些右派分子和右倾机会主义分子们就是邓拓心目中的“有作为”的人。邓拓不好意思恭维他们，明说了怕丢面子。
    那末，我们就来估一估邓拓“言传”和“意会”的这一批“学者”和“名人”吧，他们到底有多大份量？秦始皇，残暴的帝王，恶霸地主；吕思礼，封建官吏，地主的狗腿子；赵普，阴谋家赵匡胤的帮凶；就是景清和王渔洋，也不过是封建卫道者和封建文人，或明或暗，或轻或重地当了封建主义的走狗，有一个是好东西吗？没有。至于你闭口不提的资产阶级右派、右倾机会主义分子及你们“三家村”的弟兄们又是什么东西？又干了些什么？你们是反党反社会主义的阴谋家，帝国主义的走狗，修正主义的帮凶，人民的罪人，你们犯下了不可饶恕的罪恶！
    说得多么冠冕堂皇啊，“读书”、“学习”、“知识”、“学问”！读什么书？向谁学习？求知识干什么？披着多么美丽的外衣啊，“学者”、“名流”、“杂家”！谁的“学者”？干什么的“名流”？哪个封的“杂家”？这一切都是一个骗局，一个烟幕，一个钓饵！说穿了，就是要我们跟你一起去反党反社会主义，搞反革命勾当！
    是的，我们要读书，但我们要读的是毛主席的书；我们要走一条路，但我们要走的是无产阶级革命的道路。这就是结论。
    革命青年的方向早已明确，道路早已选定。毛主席早在一九三九年已经指明：“看一个青年是不是革命的……这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块”，“他今天把自己结合于工农群众，他今天是革命的；但是如果他明天不去结合了，或者反过来压迫老百姓，那就是不革命的，或者是反革命的了。”（见《青年运动的方向》）现在毛主席又号召我们到阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的三大革命运动中去经风雨，见世面。你邓拓却出来阻拦，妄图把青年引入歧途。告诉你：永远办不到！
