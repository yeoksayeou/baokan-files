Title: Cambodian Public Opinion Denounces Anti-China Rants by the US, USSR, and Their Lackeys; China's Development of Nuclear Weapons Makes U.S. Imperialism Even More Afraid to Act Recklessly; Those Who Oppose China's Nuclear Tests Are Precisely the United States and the Soviet Union

    (Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 12) Cambodian National Radio broadcast a commentary on the evening of the 11th, stating: We, the Cambodian people, fully support China's nuclear tests. We clearly believe that only by countering atomic bombs with atomic bombs can we make the aggressors fearful, forcing them to retreat and deterring them from threatening Southeast Asia.

    The radio said that the U.S. imperialists, who are attempting to "dominate the world" and oppress weak countries, are using atomic bombs to threaten other countries. The great China has worked hard to develop nuclear weapons and has achieved success, which strikes a blow to the U.S. aggressive bloc and makes them wake up and be wary.

    The commentary condemned certain Asians who act as lackeys of imperialism, actually opposing the nuclear tests of great China, even though their own countries had previously suffered from atomic bomb disasters. The commentary said, "When their masters conduct nuclear tests, they remain silent; but now, when the Chinese, who are also Asian, conduct nuclear tests to seek peace, they become angry and shout loudly. From this, we can see that these Asians have already succumbed to the US dollar and are now even shamelessly betraying the peace of Asia."

    The "Cambodge Soir" published a commentary on the 12th, stating: "China's third nuclear explosion is a brilliant victory for the forces of peace and progress over the world's reactionaries. People of all countries around the world are warmly and proudly cheering this new scientific and military achievement of the People's Republic of China."

    The commentary mentioned that some people felt "angry" about China's nuclear explosion, saying that these reactions must be used to recognize the faces of great-power chauvinists and capitulationists. In fact, those who are most "angry" about China's nuclear tests are precisely those who have consistently advocated "nuclear shields," "on the one hand, the United States, and on the other hand, the Soviet Union."

    The commentary emphasized: "These great-power chauvinists, other revisionists, and capitulationists, who form a group, can never tolerate a country like People's China raising and raising even higher the banner of anti-imperialist struggle to defend the interests of the people of all countries and peace forces in the world."

    The commentary said, "No matter what the U.S. imperialists say, and no matter what the chauvinists and capitulationists say, the truth is that China's third nuclear explosion is a very great victory for the Chinese people and for the people of all countries who are struggling against the forces of imperialism and its allies and lackeys."

    The commentary said, "U.S. imperialism and its accomplices only understand the language of force. Only when we are determined to fight them will they retreat. Therefore, if our enemies wave clubs, we must pick up clubs. If they clutch swords, we must also clutch swords. If they pick up guns, we must also pick up guns. If they have nuclear weapons, we must also have nuclear weapons. Peace cannot be achieved by begging but must be striven for."

    Phnom Penh Mayor Tioulong Tip declared to reporters on the 10th regarding China's nuclear explosion that this great victory is also the glory of small countries and an encouragement to them. Currently, the United States is threatening and invading weak nations and small countries everywhere. Now that an Asian country of ours also possesses nuclear weapons, this forces U.S. imperialism to dare not act recklessly.

### 柬埔寨舆论痛斥美苏及其走卒的反华叫嚷  中国发展核武器使美帝更不敢为所欲为  反对中国核试验的人恰恰是美国和苏联

    柬埔寨舆论痛斥美苏及其走卒的反华叫嚷
    中国发展核武器使美帝更不敢为所欲为
    反对中国核试验的人恰恰是美国和苏联
    据新华社金边十二日电  柬埔寨国家电台十一日晚上发表评论说：我们柬埔寨人民完全赞同中国进行核试验。我们明确地认为，只有以原子弹来对付原子弹，才能使侵略者有所畏惧，迫使他们后退和不敢威胁东南亚。
    电台说，因为妄图“独霸世界”、压迫弱小国家的美帝国主义者正用原子弹威胁别的国家。伟大的中国努力发展核武器并且取得了成功，这就打击了美国的侵略集团，并且使他们清醒清醒和有所顾忌。
    评论谴责某些充当帝国主义走卒的亚洲人，竟然反对伟大中国的核试验，虽然这些人自己的国家过去曾经遭受过原子弹的灾难。评论说，“当他们的主子进行核试验的时候，他们默不作声；而现在当同是亚洲人的中国人进行核试验以谋求和平的时候，他们就恼了火并且大叫大嚷起来了。从这里我们就看到，这些亚洲人已经屈从于美元，现在甚至无耻地背叛亚洲的和平。”
    《柬埔寨电讯报》十二日发表评论说：“中国的第三次核爆炸，是爱好和平和进步的力量对世界反动派的一个辉煌胜利。全世界各国人民都热烈而自豪地欢呼中华人民共和国的这一科学和军事上的新成就。”
    评论在提到有人对中国核爆炸感到“愤怒”时说，必须通过这些反应来认清大国沙文主义者和投降分子的面目。事实上，对中国的核试验感到最“愤怒”的人，恰恰是一贯鼓吹搞“核盾牌”的那些人，“一方面是美国，另一方面是苏联。”
    评论强调指出：“这些组成了一个集团的大国沙文主义者、其他的修正主义者和投降分子，从来就不能容忍象人民中国这样的一个国家，举起并且更高地举起反帝斗争的旗帜，来捍卫世界各国人民和和平力量的利益。”
    评论说，“不管美帝国主义者怎么说，也不管沙文主义者和投降分子怎么说，千真万确的是，中国的第三次核爆炸，是中国人民、是全世界正在为反对帝国主义势力和它的盟友和走卒而斗争的各国人民的一个十分伟大的胜利。”
    评论说，“美帝国主义和它的同谋者只懂得武力的语言，只有我们决心同他们斗争，他们才会退却。因此，如果我们的敌人挥舞大棒，我们就必须拿起大棒。如果他们紧握着利剑，我们也要紧握利剑。他们拿起枪，我们也要拿起枪。他们有核武器，我们也必须有核武器。和平是不能靠乞求而要去争取才能实现的。”
    金边市长狄潘十日就中国的核爆炸向新闻记者发表谈话说，这一伟大胜利也是小国的光荣并且是对它们的鼓舞。目前，美国正在到处威胁和侵略弱小民族和小国。现在我们的一个亚洲国家也拥有核武器，这就迫使美帝国主义不敢为所欲为了。
