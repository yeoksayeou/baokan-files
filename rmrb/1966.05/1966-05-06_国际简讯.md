	Rawalpindi Dispatch: Pakistan's first and largest ocean freighter built domestically was launched in Karachi on the 4th. President Ayub Khan presided over the launching ceremony.

	This 12,000-ton vessel, named "Abbas," was built by Pakistani workers and engineers at Pakistan's largest shipyard, the Karachi Shipyard, starting in April of last year.

	Kenyan Cabinet Reshuffle, Vice President Resigns
	Nairobi Dispatch: Kenyan President Kenyatta reshuffled his government on the 3rd.

	It is reported that Kenyatta appointed the former Foreign Minister Murumbi as Vice President and Minister without Portfolio, replacing the former Vice President Odinga, who recently resigned. A new Minister of Foreign Affairs has not been appointed; Kenyatta will concurrently manage the affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

	Other appointments include: James Nyamweya and Mbiyu Koinange as Ministers of State in the President's Office; former Assistant Minister of Agriculture Osogo as Minister of Information and Broadcasting, replacing Oneko, who recently resigned; former Chairman of the Kenya African Democratic Union, Ngala, as Minister of Cooperatives and Social Services, and so on.

	Italian 110,000 Steelworkers Strike
	Rome Dispatch: 110,000 Italian steelworkers held their third 24-hour national strike on the 3rd, demanding the renegotiation of contracts to improve their living and working conditions. Italian steelworkers have held three 24-hour strikes in the past eight days. These strikes are part of the struggle of 1.2 million Italian metalworkers and machinists to improve their living and working conditions.

	United States Conducts Another Underground Nuclear Test
	Washington Dispatch: According to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, the United States conducted another underground nuclear test at the Nevada Test Site on the 4th. This is the fifteenth nuclear weapons test officially announced by the United States this year and the seventy-second nuclear weapons test conducted by the United States since the signing of the Moscow Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in August 1963.

	Editor's Note: The U.S. ruling clique and its propaganda machine have been clamoring about so-called "Chinese isolation." This is a thief crying "stop thief"; it is U.S. imperialism itself that is truly isolated.

	What is isolation, and who is isolated, must be viewed from the essence, not from superficial phenomena.

	U.S. imperialism establishes military bases and assembles military blocs all over the world. It not only rears a large number of lackeys and running dogs but also pulls in many "allies," giving the appearance of an impressive lineup. In reality, every U.S. military base becomes a noose around its neck. The United States uses various military groups to control its "allies," which is not only opposed by the people of these countries but also provokes increasingly fierce resistance from the ruling groups of these countries. U.S. imperialism's support for and fostering of the reactionary forces of various countries, which are spurned and opposed by the broad masses of the people, will inevitably lead the people of various countries to oppose not only their own reactionaries but also their backstage boss, U.S. imperialism. In short, it is lifting a stone to drop it on its own feet.

	Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago: "U.S. imperialism acts despotically everywhere, placing itself in a position of antagonism to the people of the whole world, making itself more and more isolated." Currently, U.S. imperialism is trapped in the heavy encirclement of the people of the world. Its situation has never been as isolated and difficult as it is today. The struggles of U.S. imperialism to get rid of this situation are completely futile, and the result can only be to make itself more isolated and difficult.

    国际简讯
    巴基斯坦自建远洋货轮下水
    拉瓦尔品第消息：巴基斯坦自己建造的第一艘最大的远洋货轮四日在卡拉奇下水。阿尤布总统主持了下水典礼。
    这艘被命名为“阿巴斯号”的一万二千吨轮船，是巴基斯坦工人和工程师从去年四月开始在巴基斯坦最大的造船厂——卡拉奇造船厂建造的。
    肯尼亚内阁改组副总统辞职
    内罗毕消息：肯尼亚总统肯雅塔三日改组了他的政府。
    据报道，肯雅塔任命原任外长穆隆比为副总统兼不管部长，以代替最近辞职的原任副总统奥廷加。没有任命新的外交部长，肯雅塔将兼管外交部的事务。
    其他的任命包括：詹姆斯·尼亚姆韦亚和姆比尤·科伊南吉为总统办公室的国务部长、原任农业部助理部长奥索戈为新闻和广播部长，以代替最近辞职的奥内科、前肯尼亚非洲民主联盟主席恩加拉为合作和社会事务部长等。
    意大利十一万钢铁工人罢工
    罗马消息：意大利十一万钢铁工人三日举行第三次二十四小时全国性罢工，要求重新签订合同，以改善他们的生活和劳动条件。意大利钢铁工人在最近八天内已经举行了三次二十四小时罢工。这几次罢工是意大利一百二十万五金工人和机器制造工人为争取改善他们的生活条件和劳动条件而进行的斗争的一部分。
    美国又进行一次地下核试验
    华盛顿消息：据美国原子能委员会宣布，美国四日又在内华达试验场进行了一次地下核试验。这是美国今年官方宣布的第十五次核武器试验，也是一九六三年八月莫斯科部分禁止核试验条约签订以来美国的第七十二次核武器试验。
    编者按：美国统治集团及其宣传机器，一直在叫嚷所谓“中国孤立”。这是贼喊捉贼，真正孤立的正是美帝国主义自己。
    什么是孤立，谁孤立，必须从本质上而不是从表面现象来看。
    美帝国主义在全世界到处建立军事基地，拼凑军事集团。它不仅豢养了一大批仆从和走卒，而且拉住不少“盟国”，阵容煞是不小似的。实际上，美国每一个军事基地，都成为套在它脖子上的一条绞索。美国利用各种军事集团控制它的“盟国”，不但遭到这些国家的人民的反对，而且引起这些国家的统治集团日益剧烈的抗拒。美帝国主义支持和扶植被广大人民所唾弃和反对的各国反动派，更是必然促使各国人民不仅要反对本国反动派，而且要反对它们的后台老板美帝国主义。总之，它在搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    毛泽东同志早就指出：“美帝国主义到处横行霸道，把它自己放在同全世界人民为敌的地位，使它自己越来越陷于孤立。”目前，美帝国主义已陷在全世界人民的重重包围之中。它的处境从来没有象今天这样孤立和困难。美帝国主义为了想要摆脱这种处境而进行的挣扎，完全是徒然的，其结果只能使自己更加孤立和困难。
