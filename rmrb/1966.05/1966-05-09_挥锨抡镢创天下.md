    Wielding shovels and picks to build the world
    The labor chants of the Changwu commune members resonate through the mountain valleys,
    Their spirit to fight heaven and earth is immense.
    They command the three mountains to be as green as the sea,
    And vow to transform the five ridges into great dams.
    They凿 open clear springs for the warhorses to drink,
    And fill the deep ravines to plant crops.
    We commune members listen to the Party,
    And always take on the toughest battles everywhere.
    Sweat is sprinkled on Tiger's Mouth Cliff,
    And sweat irrigates and opens up Dazhai flowers;
    Red flags dance on the摩天 Ridge,
    White clouds roll and turn into colorful霞。
    Our motherland has high mountains and great ridges,
    We wield shovels and picks to build the world.
    The socialist good country,
    We will personally draw it.

    挥锨抡镢创天下
    长武社员　鱼永义劳动号子震山洼，斗天斗地劲头大，喝令三山绿如海，誓叫五岭变大坝。凿开清泉饮战马，填平深沟种庄稼，咱们社员听党话，处处专把硬仗打。虎口崖上汗水洒，汗水浇开大寨花；摩天岭上红旗舞，白云滚滚化彩霞。祖国山高岭又大，挥锨抡镢创天下，社会主义好江山，咱们亲手来描画。
