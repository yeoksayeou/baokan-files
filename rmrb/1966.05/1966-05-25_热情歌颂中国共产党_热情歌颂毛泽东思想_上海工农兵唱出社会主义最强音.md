    Enthusiastically Praise the Chinese Communist Party, Enthusiastically Praise Mao Zedong Thought:
    Shanghai Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Sing Out the Strongest Sound of Socialism
    Every program they performed at the "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival was a challenge and demonstration against bourgeois "authorities." Their militant songs and dances demonstrated the mighty momentum and power of resolutely eradicating the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 24th: The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, with the militant posture of the main force of the socialist cultural revolution, strode proudly onto the music and dance art stage. At the seventh "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival, they performed music and dance programs with distinct proletarian characteristics and a strong fighting spirit, giving the audience great inspiration and encouragement.
    Of the 4,800 performers participating in this year's "Shanghai Spring," more than 3,400 were amateur music and dance performers such as workers, peasants, and People's Liberation Army soldiers, accounting for 70 percent. They created and performed more programs than in previous "Shanghai Spring" festivals. They enthusiastically praised the Chinese Communist Party, the core force leading the Chinese revolution, and enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought, the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. They demonstrated the mighty momentum and strength of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the socialist cultural revolution, resolutely defending the great Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely eradicating the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line.
    Shanghai workers used such kind and sincere songs to express their praise for the great Mao Zedong Thought: "Chairman Mao's works are the direction, the road is clear and bright. If you ask me which road I am taking, it is to follow the Party in eternal revolution." This is the female voice ensemble singing "Chairman Mao's Works Shine with Golden Light," created and performed by workers from the Shanghai Gaoqiao Chemical Plant. The song depicts the moving scene of workers studying Chairman Mao's works with the deepest class feelings, clarifying the revolutionary direction and drawing wisdom and strength from Chairman Mao's works, singing out their infinitely firm belief in the great Mao Zedong Thought from the bottom of their hearts.
    This revolutionary song was listed as one of the excellent songs in the Shanghai Municipal Workers' Singing Competition, which was attended by more than 50,000 people not long ago, and has recently been made into a record, which is popular among the broad masses.
    More than 140 workers from the Shanghai Refinery sang the "Song of the Refinery Workers" in a majestic and heroic voice, expressing their revolutionary courage and determination to fight under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and their determination to use their "fiery hearts to make the long river of oil boil."
    The workers also performed music and dance programs at this music festival that expressed their concern for the motherland, their vision of the world, and their joyful labor for the revolution. Every program was a portrayal of their fiery combat life. Young workers from many industries, such as electricity, machinery, shipbuilding, instrumentation, chemical industry, food, and postal and telecommunications, participated in the performance. Jiang Lingen, a 56-year-old veteran worker from the Yangshupu Power Plant who participated in the three armed uprisings of Shanghai workers, also participated in the singing with revolutionary passion.
    Farmers from the suburbs brought songs and dances depicting their revolutionary activities in the countryside. You Yuhua, the daughter of a poor peasant commune member from Qixian People's Commune in Fengxian County, and five other female commune members, while performing the song and dance "Mao Tou Girls Learn to Farm," sang, "Commune girls have ambition... Waving the whip and supporting the plow for the revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants are of one heart, and the Five-Year Plan will be realized early," while using dance movements to drive cattle and support the plow, realistically showing the rural youth's fearless spirit of hardship and difficulty, determined to be red successors, willing to farm for the revolution for a lifetime. Nine scientific experiment activists from Xuhang Commune in Jiading County, who have won high yields of grain and cotton for five consecutive years, performed the ensemble singing "Scientific Farming, The More You Farm, The Sweeter It Gets," showing the commune members' perseverance in agricultural scientific experiments.
    The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai performed songs and dances reflecting the growth and strengthening of the People's Army under the nurture of Mao Zedong Thought, hard training in close combat and night combat, and heroic defense of the motherland. The song performance "Bayonet Drill," performed by fifteen soldiers, demonstrated the heroic and tenacious People's Liberation Army soldiers concentrating their hatred on the muzzle of their guns and daring to fight to the death. This program was repeated again and again in the audience's rhythmic thunderous applause. The audience was deeply delighted and encouraged to have such invincible revolutionary soldiers to defend the motherland. The dance movements of this program were all choreographed by the soldiers themselves. They said: "The stage is the battlefield. We must be heroes in killing the enemy on the battlefield, and we must also be vanguards in the socialist cultural revolution!"
    The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers took to the stage to sing on the opening day of this year's "Shanghai Spring," and also performed at two "Amateur Music and Dance Specials" and a large-scale "Mass Singing Conference." They were joined by many young students and working women from the neighborhood. With unprecedented momentum, they sang the strongest sound of the socialist era at the music festival and performed dances full of proletarian heroic aspirations. Let a handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist gangs and all the monsters and demons tremble in the face of the revolutionary fighting songs and dances of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    The programs performed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers at this year's "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival were all born in the three great revolutionary movements and closely served the three great revolutionary movements. They were all intended to occupy the cultural and artistic front, master music and dance as combat weapons, and use them to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and eliminate the enemy.
    Liu Nianlang, one of the authors of "Song of the Refinery Workers" and a young worker at the Shanghai Refinery, said well: "If the proletariat does not occupy the socialist cultural front, the bourgeoisie will occupy it. Our working class must pick up the pen ourselves and write revolutionary songs that reflect our boiling reality."
    Two years ago, when Liu Nianlang heard the good news that China was basically self-sufficient in oil, he climbed the high refinery tower, looked down at the raging furnace fire, and thought of the rapid development of his factory in recent years. Suddenly, his thoughts surged, and he couldn't help but cheer for the victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought and the victory of the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work. A series of passionate notes and lyrics poured into his heart. Since Liu Nianlang came to the Shanghai Refinery as a worker in 1962, with the support of the factory Party committee, he and the workers of the factory have successively written four songs including "Compare, Compete, and Race" and "Wang Jie's Song," which have inspired the revolutionary passion and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees.
    The performance of "Red Storytellers" by farmers from the suburbs at the music festival reflected a struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology. This program, created by the amateur creation group of Qixian Commune in Fengxian County, successfully shaped the image of "Hongying," a rural girl who, in the rural cultural revolution, used literary and artistic weapons to resolutely fight against the remaining feudal culture, through the form of gong and drum books loved by the masses. This storytelling was written by several farmers from Qixian Commune based on real people and events in the local area. The girls who performed this program were "Hongying"-style red propagandists. The story goes like this: One evening, several old artists came to their village and set up a stage to perform the feudal and erotic talent-and-beauty shadow play "Wenwu Xiangqiu." These girls thought: "We must not let feudalism and capitalism occupy the socialist cultural front in our countryside. We must take it over and plant the red flag of proletarian ideology." They and other young people in the village sang revolutionary songs and told revolutionary stories, competing with the old artists. The gang of old artists who promoted feudalism and capitalism saw that the situation was not good and slipped away, and they won.
    When the girls sang "Red Storytellers" at the music festival, their performance was vivid and realistic, and they were warmly welcomed by the audience.
    Every program created and performed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers is a challenge and demonstration against bourgeois "authorities." They simply do not believe the fallacy spread by bourgeois "authorities" that so-called composition is "unreachable." They are not bound by any rules and dare to establish the new of socialism and establish the difference of the proletariat. They have not received specialized training in composition, but they firmly believe that as long as there is revolutionary passion, they can write revolutionary songs. Relying on the leadership of the Party and the strength of the collective, they have gradually trained themselves to become not only production experts but also backbones of literary and artistic activities. People see from them that under the nurture of Mao Zedong Thought, the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are not only the creators of social material wealth, but also the creators of spiritual wealth; not only the masters of transforming the world, but also the masters of creating culture and art. They dare to charge into battle in the socialist cultural revolution, and dare to create brand-new socialist music and dance with their own hands.
    The revolutionary music and dance activities of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Shanghai are growing and strengthening in the battle. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have used revolutionary songs to praise the Party and Chairman Mao, to sing the general line of socialist construction, and to sing the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work of the Chinese people. A few years ago, when China encountered some temporary economic difficulties, and monsters and demons such as Deng Tuo on the cultural front were wantonly spreading poison, the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Shanghai stood up and used revolutionary songs to resist the decadent music promoted by the bourgeois "authorities" and "experts," and to encourage people's fighting spirit. In recent years, some bourgeois "authorities" and "experts" have also said that they want to "serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers" in words, but in fact, they look down on revolutionary songs and are unwilling to create revolutionary mass songs for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They promote what "musical mysticism" and "musical technique supremacy" are, trying to scare the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers with this. However, the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers simply ignore this set. Under the leadership of the Party, relying on Mao Zedong Thought and the collective strength of the masses, they have launched a mass revolutionary song competition and creation upsurge that is larger in scale year by year, creating many magnificent, kind, and touching songs such as "Listen to the Party's Words," "Chairman Mao's Works Shine with Golden Light," "Six-Piece Machine," "The People Want Armament," "Act to Support Vietnam," and "March Towards the Third Five-Year Plan." They live in the fiery revolutionary struggle, only they are most familiar with the revolutionary struggle, and they are best at using revolutionary songs to attack the enemy and encourage the people to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to continuously make revolution, to thoroughly make revolution, and to continuously move forward.
    It has been four years since the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Shanghai participated in the "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival. In recent years, encouraged and promoted by the excellent situation at home and abroad, with the vigorous development of the movement to perform revolutionary modern dramas, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have further launched a magnificent revolutionary song and dance movement. People can hear loud revolutionary songs everywhere from factories, villages, companies, schools, organs, and street neighborhoods. What is even more gratifying is that a large number of new-type proletarian literary and artistic fighters who can both work, fight, create, conduct, and accompany, who can sing and dance well, are emerging. The political direction of revolutionary singing activities is clear, the activities are more in-depth and frequent, and the number of participants is increasing. Last year alone, more than 200,000 employees in Shanghai's urban area and farmers in the suburbs participated in singing competitions at the district level. The number of people participating in grassroots singing activities in various units is even impossible to count. This mighty mass singing team and other revolutionary mass literary and artistic teams in Shanghai have converged into a torrent of the socialist cultural revolution. No "expert" or "authority" can stop it, and no "technique" can scare it. The working people created culture, and they are the main force of the cultural revolution. This is a matter of course, and this is something that the "Three Family Village" anti-Party and anti-socialist gang can never slander.

### 热情歌颂中国共产党　热情歌颂毛泽东思想  上海工农兵唱出社会主义最强音

    热情歌颂中国共产党　热情歌颂毛泽东思想
    上海工农兵唱出社会主义最强音
    他们在“上海之春”音乐会上演出的每一个节目，都是向资产阶级“权威”的挑战和示威。他们的战斗歌舞表现了坚决铲除反党反社会主义黑线的浩荡声势和力量。
    新华社上海二十四日电　广大工农兵以社会主义文化大革命的主力军的战斗姿态，昂首阔步登上音乐舞蹈艺术舞台，在第七届“上海之春”音乐会上演出了具有鲜明的无产阶级特性和强烈的战斗气息的音乐舞蹈节目，给予观众以极大的振奋和鼓舞。
    参加这一届“上海之春”的四千八百多个演员中，工人、农民和解放军战士等业余音乐舞蹈演员有三千四百多人，占百分之七十。他们创作和演出的节目，比历届“上海之春”都要多。他们热情歌颂领导中国革命的核心力量中国共产党，热情歌颂当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰毛泽东思想，表现了广大工农兵在社会主义文化大革命中坚决捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想，坚决铲掉反党反社会主义黑线的千军万马的浩荡声势和力量。
    上海工人用这样亲切真挚的歌声来表达他们对伟大毛泽东思想的颂扬：“毛主席著作是方向，道路指得明又亮，要问我走的那一条路，永远革命跟着党。”这是上海高桥化工厂工人创作和演出的女声表演唱《毛主席著作闪金光》。歌曲描绘了工人们以最深厚的阶级感情，学习毛主席著作，从毛主席著作中，明确革命方向，汲取智慧和力量的动人情景，唱出了他们从内心抒发出的对伟大的毛泽东思想的无比坚定的信念。
    这首革命歌曲，在不久前有五万多人参加的上海市职工歌咏比赛中被列为优秀歌曲之一，最近已经灌制唱片，在广大群众中流行。
    上海炼油厂一百四十多个工人，以雄壮豪迈的歌声演唱的《炼油工人歌》，表达了他们在毛泽东思想指引下敢于革命，敢于斗争，决心用自己“火热的心房，叫石油的长河沸腾”的英雄气概。
    工人们在这届音乐会上还演出了表现他们胸怀祖国、放眼世界，为革命而愉快劳动的音乐舞蹈节目，每一个节目都是他们火热的战斗生活的写照。参加演出的有电力、机械、造船、仪表、化工、食品、邮电等许多行业的青年工人。曾经参加上海工人三次武装起义的杨树浦发电厂五十六岁的姜林根等老工人，也怀着革命激情参加了演唱。
    郊区农民带来了描绘他们在农村大闹革命的歌声和舞蹈。奉贤县齐贤人民公社贫农社员的女儿尤玉华等六个女社员在演出歌舞《毛头姑娘学耕田》时，一面唱着“公社姑娘有志气……扬鞭扶犁为革命，贫下中农心儿齐，五年计划早实现”，一面用赶牛、扶犁的舞蹈动作，真实地表现了农村青年不怕艰苦、不怕困难，决心做红色的接班人，愿为革命种一辈子田的战斗面貌。连续五年夺得粮棉高产的嘉定县徐行公社九位科学实验积极分子演出了表演唱《科学种田，越种越甜》，表现了社员们进行农业科学实验的坚韧不拔的意志。
    驻沪解放军战士演出了反映人民军队在毛泽东思想哺育下成长壮大、苦练近战夜战硬功夫、英勇保卫祖国的歌舞。由十五个战士演出的歌表演《拼刺刀》，表现出英勇顽强的解放军战士把仇恨集中在枪口上，敢于刺刀见红的大无畏精神。这个节目在观众有节奏的雷鸣的掌声中一再重演。观众们深为有这样攻无不克、战无不胜的革命战士保卫祖国而感到欢欣鼓舞。这个节目的舞蹈动作都是战士们自己编排的。他们说：“舞台就是战场，我们在战场上要做杀敌英雄，在社会主义文化大革命中也要当尖兵！”
    广大工农兵在这一届“上海之春”开幕当天就登台高歌，还在两次“业余音乐舞蹈专场”和规模盛大的“群众歌咏大会”上作了演出。同他们一起参加演出的，还有许多青年学生和里弄的劳动妇女等。他们以前所未有的声势，在音乐会上唱出了社会主义时代的最强音，表演了充满无产阶级豪情壮志的舞蹈。让一小撮反党反社会主义的黑帮和一切牛鬼蛇神，在广大工农兵气壮山河的革命战斗歌舞面前发抖吧。
    广大工农兵在这届“上海之春”音乐会上演出的这些节目，都是在三大革命运动中诞生并密切为三大革命运动服务的，都是为了去占领文化艺术阵地，把音乐舞蹈作为战斗武器掌握在自己手中，用来团结人民，教育人民，打击敌人，消灭敌人。
    《炼油工人歌》作者之一、上海炼油厂青年工人刘年朗说得好：“社会主义文化阵地，无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级就会占领，我们工人阶级要自己拿起笔来，大写革命歌曲，反映我们沸腾的现实生活。”
      刘年朗在两年前听到我国石油基本自给的捷报时，登上了高高的炼油塔架，俯视脚下熊熊的炉火，想起自己工厂几年来的迅速发展，顿时思潮澎湃，情不自禁地欢呼伟大毛泽东思想的胜利，欢呼自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神的胜利。于是一连串充满激情的音符和歌词就涌上他的心头。刘年朗从一九六二年到上海炼油厂当工人以来，在工厂党委支持下，和本厂工人一起，先后写出了《比一比，赛一赛》、《王杰的歌》等四支歌曲，鼓舞了全厂广大职工的革命激情和生产干劲。
    音乐会上由郊区农民演出的说唱《红色故事员》的演出，反映了一场兴无灭资的斗争。由奉贤县齐贤公社业余创作组创作的这个节目，通过群众喜爱的锣鼓书形式，成功地塑造了一个在农村文化革命中，以文艺武器同残余的封建文化作坚决斗争的农村姑娘“红英”的形象。这个说唱是齐贤公社几个农民根据当地的真人真事编写出来的。演出这个节目的几位姑娘就是“红英”式的红色宣传员。事情的经过是这样的：一个傍晚，她们村里来了几个旧艺人，搭起场子要演封建、黄色的才子佳人皮影戏《文武香球》。这几个姑娘想：“我们农村的社会主义文化阵地决不能让封建主义和资本主义的文化来占领，一定要把它夺过来插上无产阶级的思想红旗。”她们和村里的其他青年一起，唱起革命歌曲，讲起革命故事，和旧艺人唱对台戏。那伙宣传封建主义和资本主义的旧艺人见势不妙就溜走了，她们取得了胜利。
    当姑娘们在音乐会上演唱《红色故事员》时，表演生动、逼真，受到了观众们的热烈欢迎。
    广大工农兵创作和演出的每一个节目，都是向资产阶级“权威”的挑战和示威。他们根本不相信资产阶级“权威”散布的所谓作曲是“高不可攀”的谬论。他们也不受任何框框的束缚，敢于标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异。他们没有受过作曲的专门训练，但是他们坚信：只要有革命的激情，就可以写出革命的歌曲。他们依靠党的领导，依靠集体的力量，逐步把自己锻炼成为既是生产能手，又是文艺活动的骨干。人们从他们的身上看到：在毛泽东思想哺育下，工农兵群众不仅是社会物质财富的创造者，也是精神财富的创造者；不仅是改造世界的主人，也是创造文化艺术的主人。他们敢于在社会主义文化大革命中冲锋陷阵，敢于用自己的双手创造崭新的社会主义音乐舞蹈。
    上海广大工农兵群众的革命音乐舞蹈活动，是在战斗中成长壮大的。一九五八年大跃进以来，广大工农兵群众用革命歌声颂扬党和毛主席，歌唱社会主义建设总路线，歌唱我国人民自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神。几年以前，当我国在经济上遭到一些暂时困难，文化战线上象邓拓之流的牛鬼蛇神大肆放毒的时候，上海工农兵群众挺身而出，用革命歌声抵制资产阶级“权威”、“专家”们推崇的那些靡靡之音，鼓舞人们的斗志。这几年以来，某些资产阶级“权威”、“专家”嘴上也说要为“工农兵服务”，实际上，他们看不起革命歌曲，不愿为工农兵创作革命的群众歌曲。他们宣扬什么“音乐神秘论”、“音乐技巧至上论”，想以此来吓唬工农兵群众。可是工农兵群众根本不理会这一套，他们在党的领导下，靠毛泽东思想，靠群众的集体力量，掀起了一个一年比一年规模更大的群众性的革命歌曲比赛和创作热潮，创作出《听话要听党的话》、《毛主席著作闪金光》、《六样机》、《人民要武装》、《行动起来支援越南》、《向第三个五年计划挺进》等许多气势雄壮、亲切感人的歌曲。他们生活在火热的革命斗争中，只有他们最熟悉革命斗争，最善于及时用革命的歌声来打击敌人，激励人民更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不断革命，彻底革命，不断前进。
    上海工农兵群众参加“上海之春”音乐会至今已经四年了。近年来，在国内外大好形势的鼓舞和推动下，随着大演革命现代戏运动的蓬勃开展，广大工农兵群众进一步展开了波澜壮阔的革命歌舞运动。人们从工厂、农村、连队、学校、机关、街道里弄，到处都可以听到嘹亮的革命歌声。更可喜的，是一批既会劳动、打仗，又会创作、指挥、伴奏，能歌善舞的无产阶级新型文艺战士正在大量涌现。革命歌咏活动的政治方向明确，活动更为深入和经常，参加的人数越来越多。仅去年参加上海市区一级歌咏比赛的职工和郊区的农民等就有二十多万人。参加各单位基层歌咏活动的人数更是无法统计。这支声势浩大的群众歌咏队伍和上海其他革命的群众文艺队伍，已汇成一股社会主义文化大革命的洪流，什么“专家”、“权威”阻挡不了它，什么“技巧”也吓不倒它。劳动人民创造了文化，他们是文化革命的主力军，这是天经地义的事，这是“三家村”反党反社会主义黑帮们永远污蔑不了的。
