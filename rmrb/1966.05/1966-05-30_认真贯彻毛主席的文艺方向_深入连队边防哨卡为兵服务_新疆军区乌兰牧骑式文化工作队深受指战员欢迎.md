    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, May 29th. The literary and sports workers of the People's Liberation Army Xinjiang Military Region conscientiously implement Chairman Mao's instruction on literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Since the end of last year, they have successively formed seven Ulanmuqi-style cultural work teams to serve the soldiers deeply in companies and border posts.
    Each of these cultural work teams consists of fourteen to twenty people. Before going to the troops, they conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's articles such as "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and "Serve the People," as well as the instructions of the Central Military Commission and Vice Chairman Lin Biao on literary and artistic work, further establishing the idea of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers wholeheartedly, and establishing the idea of taking pride in going to the most difficult and needed places. They carried costumes, props, film projectors, books, and daily necessities, braving wind, snow, and severe cold, and fearing no hardship or danger, climbing mountains and wading through rivers to go deep into the Altai Mountains, Karakoram Mountains, Ili and other places to perform for the soldiers, show movies, and sell cultural and daily necessities. Once, the first team went to Jimunai, where the snow was deep and the road was slippery, making it difficult to walk, and sometimes they could only advance fifty meters in two hours. However, the team members overcame the wind and snow on the Gobi Desert with revolutionary optimism, and finally arrived at their destination at three o'clock in the morning. In more than three months of activities in the Ili area, the second team traveled about 4,500 kilometers, performed 69 shows, screened 29 movies, held 16 get-togethers, provided guidance to 23 units, and reached an audience of 50,000 people.
    Whenever these cultural work teams arrive at a place, they try their best to combine activity arrangements with the needs of the troops, combine collective activities with decentralized activities, combine large-scale performances with small-scale visits, combine five-togetherness with soldiers and heart-to-heart talks, and learn from good people and good deeds and praise advanced figures to educate the troops. The commanders and fighters of the troops praised them for "carrying forward the tradition of the old Eighth Route Army and sowing the seeds of red literature and art." Some people enthusiastically wrote letters praising them after watching their performances late at night: "Heavy snow sends loved ones, a warm current warms the heart, being the people's old ox, loyal to the revolution."
    The soldiers' revolutionary spirit of enduring great hardships and hard work and their ideological quality of wholeheartedly serving the revolution also deeply educated the members of the cultural work team, further improving their understanding of who literature and art should serve and how to serve. Many members said: They are willing to serve the soldiers at the border posts for a lifetime.

    认真贯彻毛主席的文艺方向  深入连队边防哨卡为兵服务
    新疆军区乌兰牧骑式文化工作队深受指战员欢迎
    新华社乌鲁木齐二十九日电　人民解放军新疆军区的文艺体育工作者认真执行毛主席关于文艺为工农兵服务的指示，自去年年底以来，先后组成七个乌兰牧骑式的文化工作队，深入连队、边防哨卡为兵服务。
    这些文化工作队每队由十四人到二十人组成。他们下部队以前，认真地学习了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》、《为人民服务》等文章，以及中央军委和林彪副主席有关文艺工作的指示，进一步树立了全心全意为工农兵服务的思想，树立了以到最艰苦、最需要的地方去为荣的思想。他们带着服装道具、电影放映机、图书和生活用品等，不惧风雪严寒，不怕艰难险阻，爬山涉水，深入阿尔泰、喀喇昆仑山、伊犁等地，为战士演戏、放电影、出售文化用品和生活用品。有一次，第一队去吉木乃，雪深路滑，行走艰难，有时两小时中只能前进五十米。但是队员们以革命乐观主义的精神战胜了戈壁滩上的风雪，终于在深夜三点钟赶到目的地。第二队在伊犁地区三个多月的活动中，行程约四千五百公里，演出六十九场，放映电影二十九场，联欢十六次，辅导二十三个单位，观众达五万人次。
    这些文化工作队每到一地，都尽量做到活动安排和部队需要相结合，集体活动和分散活动相结合，大型演出和小型慰问相结合，与战士五同和谈心相结合，向好人好事学习和歌颂先进人物、教育部队相结合。部队指战员称赞他们“发扬了老八路的传统，播下了红色的文艺种子”。有的人在深夜看完他们的演出后，热情地写信表扬他们：“大雪纷飞送亲人，一股热流暖人心，做人民的老黄牛，忠心耿耿为革命。”
    战士们吃大苦耐大劳的革命精神和一心为革命的思想品质，也使文化工作队的队员受到深刻的教育，进一步提高了他们对文艺为谁服务、怎样服务的认识。不少队员表示：愿在边防哨卡为战士们服务一辈子。
