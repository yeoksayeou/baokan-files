Title: On Wu Han's Advocacy of the Spirit of "Daring"

Edition: 3

    In Wu Han's series of writings about Hai Rui, a "daring" spirit is emphasized. For example, "daring to speak and daring to act," "daring to provoke even the Governor-General and the Censor-in-Chief," "daring to stand up for the common people," "daring to scold the emperor," "as long as you dare, you can always do something," "if you don't dare, then you can't do anything." Promoting the spirit of "daring" is a black thread that runs through his writings about Hai Rui. It is particularly noteworthy that his promotion of the spirit of "daring" has a distinct characteristic: the different times, the different forms of the class struggle, the different methods adopted, the materials used, the key points highlighted, and the issues explained are all different.
    The article "The Story of Hai Rui" mainly describes three things: Hai Rui's daring to "arrest the son of Governor-General Hu Zongxian," daring to "block the path of Censor-in-Chief Yan Maoqing," and daring to "strike at the local tyrants." Here, Wu Han emphasizes Hai Rui's "protection of the people" and "thinking of the people in everything." Please see these two excerpts from the article:
          "The news that Magistrate Hai arrested the son of the Governor-General
    caused a sensation in Chun'an and spread throughout the
    Southeast. The common people were delighted, while the children of nobles and
    bureaucrats were all in pain, scolding him for being ignorant of current affairs." (Emphasis is mine, the same below) "After Yan Maoqing finished his inspection
    and left, no official in Yan Prefecture had any trouble. The Prefect
    was relieved and felt bad, saying to Hai Rui: 'It is good for the people of Chun'an, but hard on you, hard on you!'"
    "He dared to speak and dared to act, not even afraid of the Governor-General or the Censor-in-Chief. Who would dare to disobey him? Local officials under his jurisdiction who had engaged in corruption were frightened when they heard he was coming. Those with more serious crimes quickly resigned... The big landlords... were anxious and uneasy all the time."
    Here, there is no mention of Hai Rui's daring to "scold" the emperor, nor is there any mention of whether anyone sympathized with or supported Hai Rui. His focus is on promoting the idea that there are "enlightened factions" in the feudal ruling class through propagating Hai Rui's deeds of "daring" to fight against high-ranking bureaucrats and big landlords, echoing the modern revisionist promotion of the theory of class reconciliation.
    When the form of the class struggle changes, the characteristics of Wu Han's promotion of the spirit of "daring" also change. In June 1959, when right-leaning opportunists were emerging one after another, fiercely denouncing the Three Red Banners, Wu Han threw out "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor." He promoted the spirit of "daring to scold." To make people "dare" to rise up and scold, Wu Han also emphasized Hai Rui's "daring" in two ways. On the one hand, he tried his best to highlight that Hai Rui "dared" to rise up and "scold" when others did not dare to "scold":
          "In the feudal era, the emperor was inviolable. Even the emperor's name
    had to be avoided. If a character unfortunately became a 'taboo', it would
    have to be missing strokes, resulting in crippled characters, either missing
    an arm or a leg, becoming an incomplete character. People who carelessly wrote
    the taboo characters correctly were considered to have broken the law and
    would be sued, sentenced to imprisonment. As for scolding the emperor, that
    was rarely heard of. Hai Rui was the only one who really scolded the emperor
    and scolded him very happily."
          "Jiajing had been emperor for a long time... and politics had become extremely corrupt. Those who
    expressed opinions in the court were either beheaded, dismissed, imprisoned, or
    exiled, frightening everyone into silence."
    On the other hand, he tried his best to highlight the benefits Hai Rui received after "scolding" the emperor:
          "Everywhere, people sympathized with and supported Hai Rui for scolding the emperor.
    His reputation grew."
    Obviously, Wu Han's propaganda was entirely to cheer for the right-leaning opportunists.
    Two months later, at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the anti-Party crimes of the right-leaning opportunists were exposed, and their offensive was crushed. Things were not as Wu Han had estimated, that "everywhere people sympathized with and supported him," but rather that everywhere people were opposing and criticizing the right-leaning opportunists. Even some people who were dissatisfied turned to watch the wind and did not dare to stand up and speak. At this time, Wu Han's article "On Hai Rui" also changed in terms of promoting the spirit of "daring."
    First, he added content about how Hai Rui hated those who did not dare to struggle, saying:
        "What he hated most in his life were people who did not act according to their knowledge. Such people knew what was good but did not dare to do it, knew what was bad but did not dare to oppose it, stood in the middle in everything, avoided struggle, and even rode two boats, only talking about mediation and smoothing things over."
    Second, he no longer promoted Hai Rui's "daring" to do a certain thing, but promoted Hai Rui's daring to struggle to the end. The second subtitle of the article is titled "A Life of Struggle." He said: "Hai Rui's life was a life of struggle. He opposed bad people and bad things, was unyielding, never discouraged, and bravely threw his whole life into battle." "Hai Rui... did not give up, did not admit old age, was not afraid of setbacks, truly a 'stalwart man'."
    Later, the criticism of the right-leaning opportunists deepened, and the Party, according to the people's demands, "removed" the "officials" of the right-leaning opportunists. At this time, the characteristic of Wu Han's promotion of the spirit of "daring" shifted from promoting "daring to speak and dare to act" to promoting daring not to be afraid of failure, and daring to try again after failure. In his play "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," he not only slandered the Party for persecuting "loyal and good people," sang praises for the right-leaning opportunists, and encouraged them to "try again," but also, in his explanation, he tried his best to promote Hai Rui's "loss of office" but "not yielding, not discouraged," and said: "This play focuses on writing about Hai Rui's integrity, unyielding to the powerful, not frightened by failure, and the strong will to try again after failure."
    In 1961, various demons and monsters and right-leaning opportunists were active, taking advantage of the temporary difficulties in our country to stir up the "going it alone" wind and the "reversal of verdicts" wind, attempting to restore capitalism. At this time, Wu Han's promotion of the spirit of "daring" underwent new changes. Reflecting this change is the Preface to "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office."
    The Preface to "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was written in August 1961. Perhaps Wu Han saw that the time was ripe, and his promotion of the spirit of "daring" had reached a point of unbridled recklessness. If he had previously promoted the spirit of "daring" by praising Hai Rui, then at this time he directly encouraged people to "dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do." If he had previously tried to conceal the purpose of promoting the spirit of "daring," then at this time he appeared very blatant, saying: "I write scripts, and it seems that I also belong to the 'daring' category." "The ancients had the idiom 'throw a brick to attract jade,' so let this script be used as a brick to arouse the interest of friends in the historical field, and let everyone write some new historical dramas." If he had previously promoted the spirit of "daring" in a relatively obscure way, then at this time he became a loud cry: "As long as you dare, you can always do something," "if you don't dare, then you can't do anything," "the history of human social development is the history of people who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do."
    The above shows that Wu Han's promotion of the spirit of "daring" is closely linked to the political struggles of various times. Wu Han wrote about Hai Rui not for the sake of writing about Hai Rui, but viciously used the past to satirize the present, pointing at the mulberry tree and scolding the locust, singing praises for the right-leaning opportunists, and frantically opposing the Party and opposing socialism.
    From this, it can be seen that Wu Han wrote about Hai Rui not out of confusion, but consistently observed the climate at any time, carefully planned according to the class struggle situation in each period, and coordinated and encouraged the right-leaning opportunists to attack the Party.
    From this, it can be seen that Wu Han, who has always claimed to be loyal to historical data, is not loyal to historical data. In order to meet the needs of opposing the Party and opposing socialism, he can both distort historical data and use the same historical data to explain different problems.
    This is Wu Han's true face!

    评吴晗宣扬的“敢”的精神
                        谭文兴
    在吴晗写的关于海瑞的一系列著作中，都突出了一个“敢”字。例如“敢说敢做”，“连总督、都御史都敢惹”，“敢替老百姓撑腰说话”，“敢骂皇帝”，“只要敢，总可以多少做一点事”，“假如不敢，那便什么事也做不成”。宣扬“敢”的精神，是贯串在他写的有关海瑞的著作中的一根黑线。尤其值得人们注意的，是他宣扬“敢”的精神有一个显著的特点：时间不同、阶级斗争的形势不同，采取的方式、使用的材料、突出的重点和说明的问题也就不同。
    《海瑞的故事》一文，主要写了海瑞敢于“拿办总督胡宗宪的公子”，敢于“挡都御史鄢懋卿的驾”，敢于“打击豪强”这样三件事。吴晗在这里突出的重点是海瑞“保护人民”，“一切为老百姓着想”。请看这篇文章的两段摘录：
          “海知县拿办总督公子的新闻轰动了淳安，传遍了东
    南，老百姓人人称快，贵族官僚子弟个个头痛，骂他不识时务。”（着重号是我加的，下同）“等到鄢懋卿巡查完了，走了，严州府上下官员一个也没出事，知府这才放了心，过意不去，见海瑞时连说：‘好了淳安百姓，难为了你，难为了你’！”
    “他敢说敢做，连总督、都御史都不怕，谁还敢不怕他。属下的地方官员有贪污行为的听说他来了，吓得心惊胆怕，罪恶较大的赶忙自动辞官……大地主们……提心吊胆，时刻不安。”
    这里没有提到海瑞敢“骂”皇帝的事情，也没有提到有没有人同情和支持海瑞。他的着眼点，是通过宣扬海瑞“敢”于和大官僚、大地主斗争的事迹，宣扬封建统治阶级中有“明智派”，与现代修正主义宣扬阶级调和论相唱和。
    阶级斗争形势一有变化，吴晗宣扬“敢”的精神的特点也起了变化。一九五九年六月，正当右倾机会主义分子纷纷出笼，大骂三面红旗的时候，吴晗抛出了《海瑞骂皇帝》。他宣扬
  “敢骂”的精神。为了使人们“敢”于起来骂，吴晗还从两个方面突出海瑞的“敢”。一方面，尽量烘托海瑞是在别人不敢“骂”的情况下“敢”于起来“骂”：
          “在封建时代，皇帝是不可侵犯的，连皇帝的名字都
    要避讳，一个字不幸成为‘御讳’，就得缺笔闹残废，不是
    缺胳膊，就是缺腿，成为不全的字。人们不小心把该避
    ‘御讳’的字写了正字，就算犯法，要吃官司，判徒刑。
    至于骂皇帝，那是很少听说过的事。真正骂过皇帝，而又
    骂得非常痛快的是海瑞。”
          “嘉靖做皇帝时间长了……政治腐败到极点，朝中有
    人提意见的，不是杀头，便是革职，监禁，充军，吓得没
    人敢说话。”
    另一方面，又尽量突出海瑞“骂”皇帝以后得到的好处：
          “海瑞骂皇帝，同情他和支持他的人到处都是，他的
    名声越来越大了。”
    显然，吴晗的这种宣传完全是为右倾机会主义分子擂鼓助威的。
    两个月后，在党的八届八中全会上揭露了右倾机会主义分子的反党罪行，粉碎了右倾机会主义分子的进攻。事情并不象吴晗估计的那样，“同情他和支持他的人到处都是”，而是反对右倾机会主义分子、批驳右倾机会主义分子的人到处都是。就是有些心怀不满的人，也看风转舵，不敢站出来说话。这时吴晗写的《论海瑞》一文，在宣扬“敢”的精神方面也为之一变。
    第一，加进了海瑞最恨不敢斗争的人的内容，他说：
        “他一生最恨的是知和行不一致的人，这种人明知是好事而不敢做，明知是坏事而不敢反对，遇事站在中间，逃避斗争，甚至脚踏两头船，一味讲调停，和稀泥。”
    第二，不再是宣扬海瑞“敢”做某一件事，而是宣扬海瑞敢于斗争到底。文章的第二个小标题就标为《斗争的一生》。他说：“海瑞的一生是斗争的一生，他反对坏人坏事，不屈不挠，从不灰心丧气，勇敢地把全部生命投入战斗。”“海瑞……不气馁，不服老，不怕挫折，真是‘铮铮一汉子’。”
    后来，对右倾机会主义分子的批判进一步深入，党根据人民的要求“罢”了右倾机会主义分子的“官”。这时吴晗宣扬“敢”的精神的特点，就由宣扬“敢说敢做”转到了宣扬敢于不怕失败，失败了要敢再干。他写的《海瑞罢官》，不仅在戏里诬蔑党残害“忠良”，给右倾机会主义分子唱赞歌，鼓动右倾机会主义分子“再干”，而且在说明里，也竭力宣扬海瑞“丢了官”“不屈服、不丧气”，并说：“这个戏着重写海瑞的刚直不阿，不为强暴所屈，不为失败所吓倒，失败了再干的坚强意志。”
    一九六一年，各种牛鬼蛇神和右倾机会主义分子四出活动，利用我国暂时处于困难的时机，煽起了“单干风”，“翻案风”，企图复辟资本主义。这时吴晗在宣扬“敢”的精神方面又有了新的变化。反映这个变化的是《海瑞罢官》序。
    《海瑞罢官》序写于一九六一年八月，也许是吴晗看到时机成熟了吧，他在宣扬“敢”的精神方面已达到了肆无忌惮的地步。如果说，他以前宣扬“敢”的精神是通过歌颂海瑞来表现，那么，这时就直接鼓动人们，要人们“敢想，敢说，敢做”。如果说，他以前宣扬“敢”的精神还要掩饰宣扬的目的，那么，这时就显得十分露骨了，他说：“我写剧本，看来也属于敢的一流”，“古人有抛砖引玉的成语，那就让这个本子当做一块砖，引起历史学界朋友们的兴趣，大家来写点新历史剧吧”。如果说，他以前宣扬“敢”的精神还比较隐晦，那么，这时就变成大声疾呼了：“只要敢，总可以多少做一点事”，“假如不敢，那便什么事也做不成”，“一部人类社会发展史，就是敢想敢说敢做的人们的历史”。
    以上说明，吴晗宣扬“敢”的精神和各个时间的政治斗争是密切联系着的。吴晗写海瑞不是为写海瑞而写海瑞，而是恶毒地借古非今，指桑骂槐，为右倾机会主义分子唱赞歌，疯狂地反党反社会主义。
    由此可以看出：吴晗写海瑞不是出于糊涂，而是一贯地随时观察气候，根据各个时期的阶级斗争形势精心策划，配合并鼓动右倾机会主义分子向党进攻。
    由此可以看出：一向声称忠于史料的吴晗并不忠于史料。为了反党反社会主义的需要，他既可以歪曲史料，又可以用同一史料说明不同的问题。
    这就是吴晗的本来面目！
