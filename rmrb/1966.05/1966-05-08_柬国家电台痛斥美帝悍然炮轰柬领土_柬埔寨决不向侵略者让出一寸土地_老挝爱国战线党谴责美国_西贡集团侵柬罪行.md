    According to Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 6th: Cambodian National Radio broadcast a commentary on May 5th, condemning the aggression of Saigon-American troops who, on the 3rd, under the pretext of "tracking Viet Cong forces," bombarded Cambodian territory.

    The commentary said: What is particularly intolerable is that the Saigon American military authorities have once again invoked the untenable "right of pursuit." The so-called "Viet Cong forces" are actually Cambodia's defense forces, namely the army, provincial guards, and militia defending the Cambodian border. The firing originating from Cambodian territory is a response to the constant aggression, infiltration, and violation of Cambodian airspace by American-South Vietnamese troops.

    The commentary stated that the failure of the imperialist conspiracy is evident. This conspiracy has produced results directly opposite to what its orchestrators had hoped. The rampant activities of the aggressors on the Cambodian border and the losses they have caused to the Cambodian people have strengthened the unity of the entire Cambodian nation and the firm determination of the Cambodian people not to concede an inch of Cambodian territory to the aggressors.

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 5th: Cambodian Secretary of State for Information, Chhay Song, held a press conference here on the 5th regarding the recent multiple attacks by Thai troops on the Long Toan Temple outpost, condemning the Thai authorities for their continuous armed provocations against the Cambodian border.

    Chhay Song introduced the detailed circumstances of the attacks by large numbers of Thai troops on the Long Toan Temple area outpost from April 14th to 19th, saying that the Thais not only attempted to reoccupy Long Toan Temple but also intended to further invade Long Toan Temple or other places like Koh Kong Province and Osmach.

    He emphasized that Cambodia had conducted effective counterattacks, repelling the enemy's multiple incursions. On April 17th and 19th, Cambodian troops killed and wounded approximately eighty and three hundred invading enemy soldiers, respectively.

    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, May 7th: According to a Pathet Lao Radio broadcast, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on the 4th, strongly condemning the crimes of US imperialism and the Saigon puppet clique in their aggression against Cambodia, and expressing support for the just position elucidated in the Cambodian Royal Government's statement of April 23rd.

    The statement pointed out that after the US imperialism and the Saigon puppet clique attacked the Cambodian border posts in Takeo Province on April 15th and 18th, they continued to send troops to invade Cambodian territory on April 30th, disregarding the Cambodian government's protests. These aggressive actions by US imperialism and its lackeys exposed their aggressive ambitions toward Cambodia. These actions seriously violated the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Cambodia, seriously violated international law, and brutally trampled upon Cambodia's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.

    The statement, after condemning US imperialism for expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam and intensifying its aggression against Laos, pointed out that all these aggressive actions by US imperialism do not indicate its strength but only prove that it is mired in a quagmire in South Vietnam and is increasingly isolated in the world, thus becoming even more frenzied.

    The statement said that the peoples of Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia are three fraternal neighbors. Their common enemy is US imperialism. Relying on the united strength of our three nations, relying on the correct and just line, and relying on the support of peace-loving people all over the world, the struggle of our three nations will surely be victorious, and US imperialism will surely suffer a shameful defeat.

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 7th: According to a Cambodian News Agency report on the 7th, on the morning of May 5th, Thai troops stationed in positions opposite the Long Toan Temple in Cambodia opened fire on the Long Toan Temple. Cambodian troops retaliated.

    The news agency also reported that on the night of May 1st, about a platoon of Thai troops, under the cover of mortars, sneaked into Cambodian territory in Oddar Meanchey Province and attacked a Cambodian outpost in the Tnaot area again. Cambodian outpost guards exchanged fire with the invaders with mortars and automatic weapons for about half an hour, forcing the enemy to retreat back to Thailand.

    柬国家电台痛斥美帝悍然炮轰柬领土
    柬埔寨决不向侵略者让出一寸土地
    老挝爱国战线党谴责美国—西贡集团侵柬罪行
    据新华社金边六日电柬埔寨国家电台五日发表评论，谴责西贡美国军队三日借口“追踪越共军队”，炮轰柬埔寨领土的侵略行动。
    评论说：特别不能令人容忍的是，西贡美国军事当局这次又援引了站不住脚的“追踪权”，他们所谓的“越共军队”，就是柬埔寨的防御力量，也就是保卫柬埔寨边境的军队、省防军和民兵。而从柬埔寨领土上发出的射击，是对不断侵犯柬埔寨领土的美国—南越军队的经常的侵略、渗入和侵犯柬埔寨领空的反击。
    评论说，帝国主义阴谋的失败是有目共睹的，这种阴谋产生了与其策动者所希望恰恰相反的结果。侵略者在柬埔寨边界上的猖狂活动及其对柬埔寨人造成的损失，增强了柬埔寨全国的团结，增强了柬埔寨人民决不向侵略者让出一寸柬埔寨领土的坚强决心。
    新华社金边五日电　柬埔寨新闻国务秘书谢桑五日在这里就泰国军队最近多次袭击柬埔寨隆端古寺哨所举行记者招待会，谴责泰国当局不断对柬埔寨边境进行武装挑衅。
    谢桑介绍了大批泰国军队从四月十四日到十九日袭击隆端古寺地区哨所的详细情况说，泰国人不仅企图重新占领隆端古寺，还企图进一步对隆端古寺或者戈公省和奥斯马等其他地方进行侵犯。
    他强调指出，柬埔寨进行了有效的反击，打退了敌人的多次进犯。四月十七日和十九日，柬埔寨军队先后打死打伤进犯的敌军约八十名和三百名。
    新华社康开七日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会四日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义—西贡傀儡集团侵犯柬埔寨的罪行，并且表示支持柬埔寨王国政府在四月二十三日声明中所阐明的正义立场。
    声明指出，美帝国主义和西贡傀儡集团在四月十五日和十八日袭击柬埔寨茶胶省边防哨所以后，不顾柬埔寨政府的抗议，又于四月三十日继续派遣军队侵犯柬埔寨领土。美帝国主义及其走狗的这些侵略行动暴露了它们对柬埔寨的侵略野心。这些行动极其严重地违反了一九五四年关于柬埔寨问题的日内瓦协议，严重违反了国际法，粗暴地践踏了柬埔寨的独立、主权和领土完整。
    声明在谴责了美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争和加强对老挝的侵略之后指出，美帝国主义的所有这些侵略行动并不表示它的强大，而只是证明了它在越南南方陷入了泥潭，在世界上日益孤立，因此变得更加疯狂。
    声明说，老挝、越南和柬埔寨三国人民是三个兄弟邻邦。他们的共同的敌人是美帝国主义。依靠我们三个民族的团结力量，依靠正确和正义的路线，依靠全世界爱好和平人民的支持，我们三国人民的斗争必定胜利，美帝国主义必定遭到可耻的失败。
    据新华社金边七日电　据柬埔寨新闻社七日报道，五月五日上午，驻扎在柬埔寨隆端古寺对面阵地上的泰国军队向隆端古寺开炮。柬埔寨军队进行了回击。
    这家通讯社还报道，五月一日夜里，泰国军队约一个排在迫击炮的掩护下，潜入奥多棉藏省柬埔寨领土，再次袭击特纳地方的一个柬埔寨哨所。柬埔寨哨所守卫者用迫击炮和自动武器同入侵者交火约半小时，敌人被迫退回泰国。
