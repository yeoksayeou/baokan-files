    Responding to the police authorities' suppression, rescuing arrested Black brothers
    Black people in Los Angeles, USA, heroically launch resistance struggle
    Xinhua News Agency, May 9th: Los Angeles dispatch: About two hundred Black people in Los Angeles fought heroically against racist police on the evening of May 8th, and rescued a Black brother who had been arrested by the police.
    This incident occurred about one mile from the Black residential area of Watts. In August of last year, Black people in Watts launched a fierce struggle against violence, taking up arms to fight against racial discrimination and racial oppression.
    On the evening of May 8th, when two racist police officers arrested a Black man on the pretext of "fighting," two hundred Black people immediately took action to surround the two police officers and forced them to release the arrested Black man. When the police authorities dispatched a large number of people to suppress them, the Black people fought back with stones and bottles, beating them into a sorry state.

    反击警察当局镇压　营救被捕黑人兄弟
    美国洛杉矶黑人英勇展开抗暴斗争
    新华社九日讯　洛杉矶消息：美国洛杉矶市约两百名黑人八日晚上向种族主义警察展开了英勇的搏斗，并且营救了一名原来被警察逮捕的黑人弟兄。
    这个事件发生在离黑人聚居的地区瓦茨区约一英里的地方。在去年八月，瓦茨区的黑人曾经掀起激烈的反暴斗争，拿起武器为反对种族歧视和种族压迫而战斗。
    在八日晚上，当两名种族主义警官以“打架”为名逮捕一名黑人时，两百名黑人马上行动起来包围这两名警官，并且迫使他们放走被捕的黑人。当警察当局调来大批人马前来镇压时，黑人们使用石头和瓶子进行反击，把他们打得狼狈不堪。
