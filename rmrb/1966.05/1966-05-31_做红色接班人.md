    Becoming a Red Successor
    Long Mei, Yu Rong, Young Pioneer members of the Bailingmiao National Elementary School, Darhan Muminggan United Banner, Inner Mongolia
    Chairman Mao teaches us to "study hard and make progress every day" and to "become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." Deng Tuo actually wants to use "the old opera school methods" to educate us, wants us to bury ourselves in books so that we can "become famous," this is to prevent our younger generation from making revolution, this is to make us undergo "peaceful evolution," this is a blatant attack on the Party and Chairman Mao's educational policies.
    Deng Tuo slanders our Great Leap Forward as "bragging" and "talking big," which is complete nonsense. In our Darhan Muminggan United Banner, there were only five elementary schools at the beginning of liberation, but now there are more than three hundred, and we, the children of poor and lower-middle peasants and poor herdsmen, are all in school. Is this "bragging" or "talking big"?
    Deng Tuo also babbles that the Communist Party's Great Leap Forward is "not cherishing labor power." Who cherishes labor power and who doesn't, we poor herdsmen know best. Before liberation, our fathers and mothers were treated as cattle and horses, slaves, by the princes and herd owners. Did the princes and herd owners cherish labor power? After liberation, our family turned over and became masters of our own destiny. On February 9, 1964, my sister and I encountered a blizzard while herding. If it weren't for the new society, if it weren't for the wise leadership and care of the Party and Chairman Mao, if it weren't for the rescue by the workers, cadres, and doctors, uncles and aunts, educated by Chairman Mao, we would have frozen to death on the grasslands long ago. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who saved us sisters. Now we are healthy and happily studying in school. The Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao are truly concerned about and cherish our working people.
    Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements scold the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, shouting for the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to step down, so that Deng Tuo and his gang of monsters and demons can take the stage. You are daydreaming, we won't allow it. We are the daughters of poor herdsmen. Without the Party and Chairman Mao, we poor herdsmen would have nothing. This seal, we will always hold it firmly in our hands.

    做红色接班人
    内蒙古达尔罕茂明安联合旗百灵庙民族小学少先队员  龙梅　玉荣
    毛主席教导我们“好好学习，天天向上”，“成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。邓拓竟然要用“旧科班的这一套方法”来教育我们，要我们埋头读书，好将来“成名成家”，这就是要我们青少年一代不要革命，这就是要使我们“和平演变”，这是明目张胆地攻击党和毛主席的教育方针。
    邓拓诬蔑我们大跃进是“吹牛皮”，“说大话”，这完全是胡说。我们达茂联合旗解放初只有五所小学，现在发展到三百多所，我们这些贫下中农、贫苦牧民的子女都上了学，这难道是“吹牛皮”，“说大话”？
    邓拓还胡说什么共产党搞大跃进是“不爱护劳动力”，究竟谁爱护劳动力，谁不爱护劳动力，我们穷苦牧民最清楚。解放前，我们阿爸、阿妈给王公牧主当牛当马、做奴隶，王公牧主爱护劳动力吗？解放后我家翻了身，当家做主了。一九六四年二月九日，我们姊妹俩在放牧中遇到了大风大雪，若不是在新社会，若不是党和毛主席的英明领导和关怀，若不是毛主席教育下的工人、干部、医生叔叔、阿姨的抢救，我们俩早就冻死在草原上了。是党和毛主席救了我们姊妹俩。现在我们健康、幸福地在学校里学习着。中国共产党和毛主席才真正是关怀和爱护我们劳动人民的。
    邓拓一伙反党反社会主义分子骂党中央和毛主席，叫喊要党中央和毛主席下台，好让邓拓这帮牛鬼蛇神上台，你们是妄想，我们不准。我俩是贫苦牧民的女儿，没有党和毛主席就没有我们贫苦牧民的一切。这个印把子，我们永远要紧握在手中。
