    Send the Anti-Party Elements to the Garbage Heap of History
    The facts of the great leap forward in our Yangyuan County's education are an irrefutable witness. It will send Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements to the garbage heap of history.

    Liu Mankun, Principal of Chuaiguting School District
    Li Cai, Teacher of Niufanggou Primary School
    The anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and their ilk have aroused the anger in our hearts. We are determined to fight Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and their ilk to the end, and we will never give up until we achieve complete victory.
    Deng Tuo exhausted his ability to slander, using the most vicious code words to insult our great Party, our great leader, and our great socialist system. He gritted his teeth to attack and slander our Great Leap Forward, saying it was "bragging," "talking big," and "bashing heads against facts." Bah! Deng Tuo, we tell you, the people of the whole country support the Great Leap Forward, and we will never allow you to slander it. The facts are an irrefutable witness; it will send you and your gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements to the garbage heap of history.
    Deng Tuo, open your eyes and see the facts of the rapid development of education in our county!
    Before liberation, under the cruel oppression of the reactionary ruling class, the children of the vast poor peasants in Yangyuan County could not afford to go to school at all, nor did they have places to go to school. There were only 91 villages with primary schools and no middle schools in the county's 378 villages. There were only 4,080 students in school, and most of these students were the children of landlords and rich peasants. After liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the people and educational workers of our county, in accordance with Chairman Mao's educational thought, implemented the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, and launched a mass upsurge of the whole Party and the whole people running education. Now every village has a school, every production brigade has a higher primary school, and every people's commune has a middle school. The county's 378 villages have 423 middle and primary schools, with 40,887 students. Not only has primary education been popularized, but also higher primary education, and more than 70% of higher primary school graduates enter various types of middle schools. The sound of reading aloud has been heard in the remote mountain villages where there were no schools in ancient times, and the children of poor and lower-middle peasants who had never studied in their ancestors' generations have also entered school.
    In the Chuaiguting School District, 28 villages (including 20 mountainous and former tenant villages), only 6 villages had primary schools before liberation, and there was not a single school in the mountainous and tenant villages. After liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, every village has a school. Before liberation, it was impossible to find a literate person in the Shantou villages. During the New Year festivals, they used bowls with black circles to write couplets. In the early days of liberation, they used rope knots to record things. Now, children in Shantou villages can attend higher primary school without leaving the village, and they can also attend middle school without going down the mountain! For example, Wangjialiang on Jiankou Mountain, 3,000 meters above sea level, all 24 households in the village are poor and lower-middle peasants. In 1958, the Party established a school in this village, which has now developed into a combined primary and middle school with single classes. The children can not only attend higher primary school without leaving the village, but also attend middle school without leaving the village!
    Niufanggou Village, Jing'ergou Commune, was a tenant village before liberation and never had a school. The masses suffered the bitterness of not having culture. After liberation, as early as 1949, this village established a junior primary school, and during the Great Leap Forward of 1958, this junior primary school developed into a higher-junior combined complete primary school. In 1965, during the continued Great Leap Forward, an agricultural middle school was established. Before liberation, it was impossible to find a literate person to write letters and write couplets; in the early days of liberation, it was difficult to find an accountant for the mutual aid team; now, there are not only higher primary school graduates, but also junior and senior high school graduates.
    Are these ironclad facts "talking big" or "bragging"? These facts exist all over the country. Deng Tuo, why don't you open your eyes and see! In the face of these facts, it is precisely you who are "bashing your head against facts."
    Chairman Mao teaches us: "In class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are stamped with the brand of a class." What tree blooms what flower, what vine bears what melon, what position you stand on, what you say. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries viciously attack our Great Leap Forward, domestic landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists oppose our Great Leap Forward, and Deng Tuo and his ilk also slander our Great Leap Forward. They are all accomplices, all trying to use various opportunities to oppose the Party and socialism, seize the people's power, and restore capitalism.
    The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are our great benefactors and saviors, leading us to hold high the great red flag of the general line and move towards socialism and communism. We will always listen to Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao, and follow the Communist Party. We shout: Long live the general line! Long live the Great Leap Forward! Long live the People's Commune!
    Now Deng Tuo's fox tail has been pulled out. We must seize it and not let go, fight him down, discredit him, and overthrow him.

    我们阳原县教育事业大跃进的事实，是无情的见证人。它将把邓拓这伙反党反社会主义分子送到历史垃圾堆里去

    邓拓、吴晗之流的反党反社会主义的罪行，激起了我们的心头怒火。我们坚决和邓拓、吴晗之流斗争到底，不获全胜，决不罢休。
    邓拓极尽谩骂之能事，用了最恶毒的黑话，辱骂我们伟大的党，伟大的领袖和伟大的社会主义制度，咬牙切齿地攻击诬蔑我们的大跃进，说什么“吹牛皮”，“说大话”，“在事实面前碰得头破血流”。呔！邓拓，我们告诉你，全国人民拥护大跃进，决不允许你诬蔑。事实是无情的见证人，它将把你们这伙反党反社会主义分子送到历史垃圾堆里去。
    邓拓，睁开你的眼看一看，我县教育事业飞速发展的事实吧。
    解放前，在反动统治阶级的残酷压榨下，阳原县广大贫苦农民的子女根本念不起书，也没有地方念书。全县共有三百七十八个村庄，只有九十一个村庄有小学，没有一所中学，在校学生仅有四千零八十人，而这些学生绝大多数又是地主、富农子女。解放后，特别是一九五八年大跃进以来，我县人民和教育工作者遵照毛主席的教育思想，贯彻了党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，掀起了全党全民办教育的热潮。现在村村有了学校，生产大队都有了高小，人民公社都有了中学。全县三百七十八个村庄有中、小学四百二十三所，有学生四万零八百八十七人，不仅普及了初小，而且普及了高小，高小毕业生升入各类中学的达百分之七十以上。自古没有学校的深山庄传出了琅琅的读书声，祖祖辈辈没有念过书的贫下中农的子女也都入了学。
    揣骨町学区二十八个村庄（其中有山区和过去的佃庄村二十个），解放前只有六个村有小学，山区和佃庄村没有一所学校。解放后，特别是大跃进以来，村村有了学校，解放前山头村庄找不到一个识字人，逢年过节写对联，用碗扣黑圈，解放初用麻绳打结记事。现在山头村庄的孩子们不出村能上高小，不下山也能念中学。例如：海拔三千米的箭口山上的王家梁，全村二十四户都是贫下中农。一九五八年党给这村办起了学校，现在发展成为一所中、小学单班复式学校，孩子们不仅不出村能上高小，而且不出村还能念中学呢！
    井儿沟公社牛坊沟村，解放前是个佃户村，从来没有学校，群众饱尝了没有文化的苦头。解放后，早在一九四九年，这村就成立了初小，而且在大跃进的一九五八年，这初小又发展成为高初复式完小，在持续大跃进的一九六五年又办起了农业中学。解放前，写信、写对联还找不到识字人；解放初，互助组很难找到会计；现在不仅有了高小毕业生，而且有了初中、高中毕业生。
    以上这些铁的事实，难道是“说大话”，“吹牛皮”吗？这些事实在全国各地都有，邓拓，你为什么不睁开眼睛看一看！在这些事实面前，“碰得头破血流”的正是你。
    毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”什么树开什么花，什么蔓结什么瓜，站在什么立场就说什么话。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派恶毒攻击我们的大跃进，国内的地富反坏右反对我们的大跃进，邓拓之流也诬蔑我们的大跃进。他们都是同伙，都想利用各种时机反党反社会主义，夺取人民政权，让资本主义复辟。
    共产党，毛主席是我们的大恩人、大救星，领导我们高举总路线的伟大红旗，走向社会主义、共产主义。我们永远听毛主席的话，跟毛主席走，跟共产党走，高呼总路线万岁，大跃进万岁，人民公社万岁。
    现在邓拓的狐狸尾巴已经揪出来了。我们一定要揪住不放，斗倒他，斗臭他，斗垮他。
