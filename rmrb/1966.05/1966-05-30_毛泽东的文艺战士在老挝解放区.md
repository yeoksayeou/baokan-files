    Mao Zedong's Literary and Art Fighters in the Lao Liberated Zone
    The first art troupe sent by the Chinese people to visit the Lao Liberated Zone—the China Yunnan Acrobatic Art Troupe—carrying the profound friendship of the 650 million Chinese people, came to the Lao front for performances and was warmly welcomed and highly praised by the patriotic soldiers and civilians in the Lao Liberated Zone. The audience praised them as "worthy of being Mao Zedong's literary and art fighters, excellent sons and daughters of New China."
    
    Remaining Unfazed When Mount Tai Collapses Before You
    The China Yunnan Acrobatic Art Troupe's performances often took place amidst deafening bomb and artillery explosions.

    At the front of Phou Kout Mountain, they even set up the stage within the enemy's artillery range. On the first day of this performance, the Kong Le forces launched a large-scale offensive against Phou Kout Mountain with ten battalions, coordinated by American aircraft and Thai artillery. That day, American imperialism dispatched more than 120 aircraft sorties, carrying out continuous bombing and strafing for nine hours. However, the performers and the audience, with the spirit of "remaining unfazed when Mount Tai collapses before you," carried on with the performance to the end amidst the deafening explosions of bombs and artillery shells.

    When six enemy planes dove directly towards the performance site, bombing and strafing wildly everywhere, a young female performer was standing on top of a male performer, performing the thrilling "Plate Spinning" act. Amidst the constant roar of explosions, they continued to perform calmly. Their firm and fearless spirit deeply moved all the audience. Many were moved to tears, and many couldn't help but embrace the Chinese performers warmly, cheering and saluting them. Vice Commander Tie, of the Lao Patriotic Neutral Forces Command, repeatedly praised, "The Chinese friends are truly unafraid of danger, calm as usual!"

    The performers called this performance the "Battle of Phou Kout Mountain." During the performance, although the enemy's bombs shattered the nearby dense forests and hard rocks, the performers not only successfully completed all the programs according to the original plan, but also added two more performances. The Lao People's Liberation Army commander at the Phou Kout Mountain front, who watched the performance, was very moved and said, "This is a great victory of strong will! A great victory of Sino-Lao friendship!"

        Enthusiasm That Cannot Be Washed Away by the Storm
    Torrents of heavy rain lashed fiercely at the open-air theater in the jungle, soaking the props, the stage, and the performers' costumes. However, the performers said, "For the friendship between the Chinese and Lao peoples, and to pay tribute to the Lao people standing on the front line of the anti-American struggle, we will persist even if it rains awls!" So, braving the rain and treading on the muddy and slippery ground, they continued to perform, and they performed even more vigorously and brilliantly. As for the audience? The rain grew heavier and heavier, but more and more people came. Some put up umbrellas, some put on raincoats, some climbed up trees, and some didn't bring any rain gear, letting the wind and rain blow on them, but all the audience watched with great interest in the rain. The gale could not break their deep friendship, and the storm could not wash away their high enthusiasm. They constantly used storms of applause and cheers that shook the valley to counter the storm of nature. The audience's heartfelt appreciation for the performance encouraged the performers, and the performers' superb skills and unwavering spirit moved the audience. The feelings of the audience and the performers were completely integrated.

      Saw the Sincere Heart of the Chinese People
    The sound of joy echoed in the jungle, and the Chinese performers performed one program after another with great enthusiasm. But the only person watching their wonderful performance had tears in his eyes—tears of gratitude!

    Here's what happened: This day, when the acrobatic troupe returned to their residence after a large performance in Mang Fang, they encountered a "Pathet Lao" soldier from the front. When they saw that the soldier had long hair, they didn't bother to take off their makeup and enthusiastically gave him a haircut and asked him to tell stories of battles on the front. When they heard about the many arduous struggles of the patriotic forces on the front and the recent victories, they were deeply moved. And when they learned that this soldier had not seen their performance, they disregarded the fatigue of driving all night and performing all day, and with deep respect and sincere friendship for the heroes standing on the front line of the anti-American struggle, they warmly performed for this only audience member, and even performed the difficult large-scale "Martial Arts" program on the rugged hillside. The performers were excited, and the viewer was moved to tears. He said, "What I saw was not only your friendly performance, but also the sincere heart of the 650 million Chinese people."

    This is just one of countless moving stories. To facilitate the audience and enable more people to see the performances, the acrobatic troupe often took the trouble to make special trips to the positions of the Lao Patriotic Armed Forces, to the wards of field hospitals, to the cooking squads of the companies, and to some remote mountain villages to give performances for those who could not leave their posts. Sometimes, they even carried wounded soldiers who could not walk to the performance venue to watch.

    Worthy of Being Strong Fighters of the Great Chinese People
    Lao people from all walks of life often mentioned in their speeches, in forums, and in the guestbook that this visit and performance by the China Yunnan Acrobatic Art Troupe "left an indelible impression in our hearts."

    Nohak Phoumsavan, representative of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, repeatedly praised the Chinese performers, saying, "Your performances are completely revolutionary, and you embody the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people!" Song Vang, the governor of Xieng Khouang Province, said, "Your programs reflect the progress and strength of your country, and you are worthy of being strong fighters of the great Chinese people."

    The general audience especially liked the "Female Militia," who were accurate shots. A group of audience members in Phongsaly wrote in the guestbook: "From your performance of the 'Female Militia' program, we deeply realized that the Chinese people have developed superb skills to defend their motherland and world peace, which is a full reflection of Chairman Mao's concept of people's war. We firmly believe that if American imperialism dares to invade China, it will surely be annihilated in the vast ocean of people's war."

    Welcoming Chinese Comrades with Victorious Battles
    The patriotic soldiers and civilians in the Lao Liberated Zone warmly received them with the feeling of welcoming their closest comrades, and overcame many difficulties to make all preparations for their visit and performance. All of this gave all the performers tremendous strength. The leaders of the Lao Two Patriotic Armed Forces Command met with and cared for the acrobatic troupe, which gave them even greater encouragement. When they went to the Mang Fang front for performances, in order to ensure the safety of their vehicles at night on a newly recovered road where enemy and puppet bandits often came to harass and lay landmines, a person in charge of Xieng Khouang Province risked danger and sat in the first vehicle, leading the way for them. This noble act of sacrificing oneself for friendship moved the acrobatic troupe members very much. They said, "We saw a noble quality, a spirit of internationalism, in our Lao friends."

    The heroic and unyielding fighting spirit of the Lao patriotic soldiers and civilians also deeply moved and greatly encouraged all members of the acrobatic troupe. Just as the acrobatic troupe was giving a performance at the Phou Kout front, Kong Le's ten battalions, coordinated by the American Air Force and Thai artillery, launched a large-scale and rampant attack on Phou Kout Mountain. The patriotic forces guarding the Phou Kout Mountain front proposed: "We must welcome and thank our Chinese comrades with victorious battles!" Filled with hatred for American imperialism and its lackeys, the Lao patriotic soldiers and civilians fought bravely, annihilated hundreds of enemies, and crushed the enemy's offensive. All members of the acrobatic troupe performing on the front line saw with their own eyes the heroic Lao people fighting selflessly to defend the Liberated Zone and their motherland, and also saw how sincere the Lao people's fighting friendship with the Chinese people was. They said, "Here we have taken a most vivid lesson in revolutionary heroism and internationalism." In a congratulatory letter to the heroes of Phou Kout Mountain, the acrobatic troupe wrote: "We will never forget your care and encouragement for us, and your courageous fighting spirit is an excellent example for us to learn from." When this letter was sent to the front, it was immediately passed around among all the commanders and fighters as the most precious gift and the most sincere congratulations. They said: This is a torch of friendship that will never be extinguished and will forever burn in our hearts.

### 毛泽东的文艺战士在老挝解放区

    毛泽东的文艺战士在老挝解放区
    中国人民派出的第一个访问老挝解放区的艺术团——中国云南杂技艺术团，带着六亿五千万中国人民的深情厚谊，来到老挝前线进行访问演出，受到了老挝解放区广大爱国军民的热烈欢迎和高度赞扬。观众夸奖他们“不愧是毛泽东的文艺战士，新中国的优秀儿女”。
    泰山崩于前而色不变
    中国云南杂技艺术团的演出经常是在震耳欲聋的炸弹和炮弹爆炸声中进行的。
    在富科特山前线，他们曾把舞台设到敌人的炮火射程之内。在这次慰问演出的第一天，就正好遇上贡勒部队以十个营的兵力在美国飞机和泰国炮兵配合下向富科特山发动一次大规模进攻。这一天，美帝国主义出动了飞机一百二十多架次，向这里进行了连续九小时的轰炸和扫射。可是，演员和观众却都以“泰山崩于前而色不变”的气概，在轰隆的炸弹、炮弹爆炸声中把这场演出进行到底。
    当六架敌机直接朝着演出场地俯冲过来，并且到处狂轰滥炸的时候，一位青年女演员正站在一位男演员头顶上表演着惊险的“顶碗”节目。在轰隆不断的炸弹爆炸声中，他们神色自若地继续演出。他们这种坚定无畏的精神，使所有观众都深受感动。许多人激动得热泪盈眶，许多人情不自禁地同中国演员热烈拥抱，向他们欢呼致敬。老挝爱国中立力量指挥部副总指挥铁少校不断称赞地说：“中国朋友真是临危不惧，镇定如常！”
    演员们把这场演出称之为“富科特山之战”。在演出过程中，尽管敌人的炸弹炸烂了附近茂密的树林和坚硬的山石，但是，演员们不仅按原订计划胜利演完了所有节目，而且还加演了两个节目。曾在场观看这次演出的老挝人民解放军富科特山前线指挥员非常感动地说：“这是一次坚强意志的巨大胜利！是中老友谊的巨大胜利！”
        暴风雨冲不掉的热情
    阵阵的倾盆大雨猛烈地冲刷着丛林里的露天剧场，雨水把道具、场地和演员们的服装全部淋湿。可是，演员们却表示：“为了中老两国人民的友谊，为了向站在反美斗争前线的老挝人民致敬，就是天上下锥子，我们也要坚持下去！”于是，他们冒着暴雨，脚踏泥泞而滑溜的场地，继续进行表演，而且演得更起劲，更出色。至于观众呢？雨越下越大，人却越来越多。有的人打起了雨伞，有的人穿起了雨衣，有的人爬上了大树，还有的人未带任何雨具，任凭风吹雨打，所有观众都兴致勃勃地在雨中观看。狂风吹不垮他们的深情厚谊，暴雨冲不掉他们的高度热情。他们不断以震荡山谷的暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声来迎击那大自然的暴风雨。观众这种对演出由衷的赞赏鼓舞了演员，而演员精湛的演技和坚毅的精神又感动了观众。观众和演员的感情完全融合在一起了。
      看到了中国人民赤诚的心
    欢乐声在丛林中回荡着，中国演员们满怀盛情地表演着一个又一个节目。可是观看他们这场精采演出的却只有一个人。这唯一的观众的眼睛里满含着泪水——这是感激的泪水啊！
    事情原来是这样：这天，杂技团在芒方某地进行一场大型演出后回到住地的时候，遇到了一位来自前线的“巴特寮”战士。他们看到这位战士头发很长，就顾不得卸装，热情地为他理起发来，并且请他讲述前方的战斗故事。当他们听了关于前线爱国部队许多艰苦奋斗的生动事迹和新近取得的胜利消息时，他们都极为感动。而当他们得知这位战士还没有观看过他们的演出的时候，他们便不顾一夜行车和一天演出的疲劳，怀着对站在反美斗争前线的英雄们的深切的敬意和诚挚的友情，热忱地为这位唯一的观众表演起节目来，而且在坎坷不平的山坡上还演出了很难演出的大型“武术”节目。表演者热血沸腾，观看者热泪滚滚，他说：“我看到的不光是你们友好演出，而且看到了六亿五千万中国人民赤诚的心。”
    这仅仅是无数动人故事中的一个。为了便利观众，使更多的人能够看到演出，杂技团经常不辞劳苦地专程到老挝爱国武装部队的阵地，到战地医院的病房，到连队的炊事班以及一些偏僻的山村，为那些因不能离开自己岗位而前来观看表演的人们进行慰问演出。有时，他们还背着不能行走的伤员到演出场地观看。
    称得上是伟大中国人民的坚强战士
    老挝各界人士在讲话中，在座谈会上和在留言簿里都常常谈到，中国云南杂技艺术团这次访问演出，“在我们的心坎上留下了不可磨灭的印象”。
    老挝爱国战线党中央代表诺哈·冯沙万一再称赞中国演员说：“你们的演出完全是革命化的，你们体现了中国人民的革命精神！”川圹省省长宋旺说：“你们的节目，反映了你们国家的进步和强大，你们称得上是伟大的中国人民的坚强战士。”
    广大观众特别喜欢枪法百发百中的“女民兵”。丰沙湾一群观众在留言簿上写道：“从你们演出的‘女民兵’节目中，使我们深深体会到中国人民为了保卫祖国和世界和平，练出了一身硬本领，这是毛主席人民战争思想的充分体现。我们深信，如果美帝国主义胆敢侵犯中国，一定会被消灭在人民战争的汪洋大海中。”
    用胜利的战斗来欢迎中国战友
    老挝解放区爱国军民以欢迎自己最亲密的战友的心情热情地接待了他们，并且克服了许多困难，为他们做好访问演出的一切准备。这一切给了全体演员巨大的力量。老挝两支爱国武装力量指挥部的领导人对杂技团的接见和亲切的关怀，更给了他们巨大的鼓舞。当他们前往芒方前线演出时，为了保障他们夜间在一条敌伪土匪武装还经常前来骚扰和埋设地雷的新收复的公路上的行车安全，川圹省的一位负责人冒着危险，坐在第一辆车上，在前面为他们开路。这种舍己为友的崇高行为使杂技团人员十分感动，他们说：“我们从老挝朋友的身上看到了一种高贵品质，一种国际主义精神。”
    老挝爱国军民英勇不屈、同仇敌忾的战斗精神也深深地感动和极大地鼓舞了杂技团全体人员。正当杂技团在富科特前线进行慰问演出时，遇上了贡勒的十个营部队在美国空军和泰国炮兵配合下，向富科特山发动了大规模的猖狂进攻，守卫在富科特山前线的爱国部队便提出：“我们一定要用胜利的战斗来欢迎和感谢中国的战友！”老挝爱国军民怀着对美帝国主义和它的走狗的仇恨，奋勇作战，歼灭了数百名敌人，粉碎了敌人的进攻。正在前线演出的杂技团全体人员亲眼看到了英雄的老挝人民为保卫解放区、保卫祖国而奋不顾身地进行战斗，也看到了老挝人民对中国人民有着多么诚挚的战斗友谊。他们说：“在这里我们上了一堂最生动的革命英雄主义和国际主义的课。”杂技团在给富科特山英雄们的一封祝贺信中写道：“你们对我们的关怀和鼓励，我们永远不会忘记，你们的勇敢的战斗精神更是我们很好的学习榜样。”当这封信一送到前线的时候，立刻被当作最珍贵的礼物和最真诚的祝贺而在所有指战员中传开了。他们说：这是一束永不熄灭的友谊的火炬，将永远在我们心中燃烧。
