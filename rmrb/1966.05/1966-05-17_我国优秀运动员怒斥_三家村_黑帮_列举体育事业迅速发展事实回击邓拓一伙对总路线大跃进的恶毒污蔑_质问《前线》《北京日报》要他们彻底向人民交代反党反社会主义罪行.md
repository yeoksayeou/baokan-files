    According to Xinhua News Agency, May 16th, our outstanding athletes Xu Yin-sheng, Li Fu-rong, Ni Zhi-qin, Zheng Feng-rong, Wu Fu-shan, Qian Cheng-hai, Yang Bo-yong, Chen Jing-kai, He Jian-hua, and others have held symposiums and submitted articles to newspapers in recent days, actively participating in the struggle to smash the "Three-Family Village." In their symposiums and articles, they stated that the target of attack by Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and other small group of black gangsters is always the Party, Mao Zedong Thought, and our country's socialist system. Our struggle with them is a struggle concerning whether or not we want the Party, whether or not we want Mao Zedong Thought, and whether or not we want socialism; it is a life-and-death political struggle.

    Table tennis player Xu Yin-sheng said that it is often said, "Birds of a feather flock together." The reason Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and others gathered together to open the "Three-Family Village" black shop is because their common goal is to oppose the Party and oppose socialism. In the socialist era, as Chairman Mao pointed out, after the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably engage in a desperate struggle with us. We must not underestimate these enemies. We athletes feel indignant at Deng Tuo and his ilk for attacking our great Party and opposing the socialist system. We must stand up and fight them! Men's high jumper Ni Zhi-qin said that the old society left us only the shame of being the "sick man of East Asia"; but now, in just over a dozen years, our sports undertakings have achieved extremely brilliant achievements. What is the reason for this? It is because we have the brilliant leadership of the great Party and the great Chairman Mao, and the socialist system provides us with superior conditions. Our sports undertakings will accomplish nothing if they depart from the leadership of the Party and Mao Zedong Thought. Deng Tuo and others want to oppose the Party and Mao Zedong Thought. This is absolutely impossible! Women's high jumper Zheng Feng-rong pointed out in her speech that each class speaks for its own interests. The more our cause develops, the more unwilling the class enemies are, so they desperately oppose us. However, the more they oppose the Party, the more it proves the Party's brilliance, greatness, and correctness. Now, the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang has been exposed. This is a great thing. By thoroughly eliminating them, our revolutionary cause can develop even faster.

    Table tennis player Qiu Baoqin said that our country has never been as strong as it is now, and our country's international prestige is increasing day by day. Every one of our achievements generates great encouragement for the revolutionary people of the world and makes imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionary forces panic and tremble. Anti-Party and anti-socialist elements extremely hate our people's victorious advance on the socialist road, but they have no way to stop the advance of history. Xu Yin-sheng said that when our table tennis team went abroad to compete in 1953, people looked down on us, and national teams were unwilling to play with us. But for more than a decade, we have read Chairman Mao's books, listened to Chairman Mao's words, armed ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, had the motherland in our hearts, kept the world in view, and strived to climb the world's peaks, constantly moving from victory to greater victory. Deng Tuo, the manager of this "Three-Family Village" black shop, cursed that we had "destroyed all the belongings of an egg." We say that what is destroyed can only be your black shop that attacks the Party and socialism, and the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are forever invincible. Weightlifter Chen Jing-kai said that for more than a decade, under the correct leadership of the Party, holding high the banner of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, we have not been afraid of difficulties, we have trained hard, and we have rapidly changed the backward face of our country's weightlifting movement, continuously breaking the world record twenty-five times. At present, the number of world records held by our country's weightlifting athletes ranks second in the world. This is an iron fact. In the face of these facts, it is only Deng Tuo and other small group of echoes of imperialism and modern revisionism who will "run into a brick wall."

    When talking about the fact that "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" have been releasing large amounts of poison in recent years, suppressing mass contributions, and playing tricks of false criticism and true protection, attempting to help Deng Tuo get through, the athletes were all filled with righteous indignation and irrepressible anger. Women's high jumper Wu Fu-shan said that we will never allow Party publications and Party newspapers to be turned into anti-Party tools. Basketball player Yang Bo-yong said that "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" have become a garden for Deng Tuo and other small group of people to release poisonous weeds, while contributions that hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and expose and criticize Deng Tuo and others' political faces are subjected to all kinds of difficulties and are not published. We want to ask: What position are you standing on? Who are you serving? Volleyball player Zhuo Erhan said that these three newspapers and periodicals must thoroughly explain their anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes to the people and honestly dig from the root, otherwise we will never agree!

    Swimmers Zhou Tongwen and Li Lifen, volleyball player Su Caixia, weightlifter Li Jiyuan, table tennis player Li Furong, football player Chen Jiagen, basketball player Qian Chenghai, parachutist He Jianhua and others resolutely expressed in their speeches and articles that they must devote themselves well to the struggle of this Great Cultural Revolution, stand firm, keep their eyes open, distinguish right from wrong, overthrow all demons and monsters, and ensure that our socialist motherland will never change color.

    我国优秀运动员怒斥“三家村”黑帮
    列举体育事业迅速发展事实回击邓拓一伙对总路线大跃进的恶毒污蔑
    质问《前线》《北京日报》要他们彻底向人民交代反党反社会主义罪行
    据新华社十六日讯　我国优秀运动员徐寅生、李富荣、倪志钦、郑凤荣、吴浮山、钱澄海、杨伯镛、陈镜开、赫建华等连日来举行座谈会，向报纸投稿，积极参加捣毁“三家村”的斗争。他们在座谈会上和文章中谈到，邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙等一小撮黑帮的攻击矛头总是对准党，对准毛泽东思想以及我国的社会主义制度。我们和他们的斗争，是关系到要不要党、要不要毛泽东思想、要不要社会主义的斗争，是一场你死我活的政治斗争。
    乒乓球运动员徐寅生说，人们常说，“物以类聚”。邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙等人所以纠集到一起，开起“三家村”黑店，是因为他们的共同目标都是反党反社会主义。在社会主义时代，正如毛主席指出的，在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。我们运动员对于邓拓之流攻击我们伟大的党，反对社会主义制度感到气愤，我们一定要站出来同他们斗争！男子跳高运动员倪志钦说，旧社会留给我们的，只有“东亚病夫”的耻辱；而现在，仅仅十几年的时间，我们的体育事业就取得了极其辉煌的成就。这是什么原因？是因为我们有伟大的党、伟大的毛主席的英明领导，有社会主义制度给我们提供了优越的条件。我们的体育事业离开党的领导、离开毛泽东思想，就将一事无成。邓拓等人要反对党、反对毛泽东思想，这是绝对办不到的！女子跳高运动员郑凤荣发言指出，什么阶级说什么话。我们的事业越发展，阶级敌人越是不甘心，因此他们拼命地反对我们。但是，他们越是反对党，越是说明党的英明、伟大与正确。现在，反党反社会主义的黑帮被揪出来了，这是大好的事情。把他们彻底肃清，我们的革命事业就能更快地发展。
    乒乓球运动员仇宝琴说，我们的国家，从来没有象现在这样强大，我国的国际威望日益提高。我们的每一个成就，都对世界革命人民产生巨大的鼓舞力量，使帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动势力惊慌、发抖。反党反社会主义分子极端仇视我们人民在社会主义的康庄大道上胜利前进，但他们是毫无办法阻止历史前进的。徐寅生说，一九五三年我们乒乓球队出国比赛，人家都瞧不起我们，国家队不愿跟我们打。但是十几年来，我们读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，用毛泽东思想武装自己，心怀祖国，放眼世界，奋勇攀登世界高峰，不断从胜利走向更大胜利。邓拓这个“三家村”黑店的掌柜，咒骂我们“一个鸡蛋的家当”“全部毁掉了”。我们说，毁掉的只能是你们那个向党向社会主义进攻的黑店，而用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民，是永远不可战胜的。举重运动员陈镜开说，十几年来，我们在党的正确领导下，高举总路线、大跃进的旗帜，不畏艰难，刻苦锻炼，已经迅速地改变了我国举重运动一穷二白的落后面貌，连续打破二十五次世界纪录。目前，我国举重选手保持的世界纪录项数居世界第二位。这是铁的事实。在这些事实面前，“碰得头破血流”的，只能是邓拓等一小撮帝国主义和现代修正主义者的应声虫。
    在谈到《前线》、《北京日报》和《北京晚报》近几年来大放毒，扣压群众稿件，玩弄假批判、真包庇的骗局，企图保护邓拓过关时，运动员们个个义愤填膺，怒不可遏。女子跳高运动员吴浮山说，我们决不允许把党刊、党报变成反党工具。篮球运动员杨伯镛说，《前线》《北京日报》成了邓拓等一小撮人大放毒草的园地，而对高举毛泽东思想红旗，揭露、批判邓拓等人政治面目的稿件却百般刁难，不予发表。我们要质问：你们究竟是站在什么立场？你们是为谁服务的？排球运动员卓尔汉说，这三家报刊必须彻底向人民交代反党反社会主义的罪行，老老实实从根子上挖一挖，否则，我们决不答应！
    游泳运动员周同文、李丽芬，排球运动员苏彩霞，举重运动员黎纪元，乒乓球运动员李富荣，足球运动员陈家根，篮球运动员钱澄海，跳伞运动员赫建华等，在发言和文章中坚决表示，要很好地投身于这场文化大革命的斗争中，站稳立场，擦亮眼睛，明辨是非，将一切牛鬼蛇神斗倒，保证我们社会主义祖国永不变色。
