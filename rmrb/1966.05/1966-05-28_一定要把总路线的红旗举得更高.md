    This Socialist Cultural Revolution is a top priority matter concerning the fate of all the people of China and the world. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon to resolutely open fire on the "Three-Family Village" black gang and all monsters and demons, and thoroughly destroy the dark nest of anti-Party and anti-people elements.
    We Must Hold the Red Flag of the General Line Even Higher
    Chen Deshun, Secretary of the General Branch of Yinxi Brigade, Yinxi Commune, Fuqing County, Fujian Province
    When we read in the newspapers about the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of Deng Tuo, Liao Mosha, Wu Han, and others, we felt uncontrollable anger. In recent days, in the fields and villages of Yinxi, as well as in various discussion meetings, everyone has angrily condemned the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of this gang of blackguards. The commune members all say that we work hard to grow white rice to feed them, but they work for capitalism and modern revisionism, which is truly "raising a rat to bite the cloth bag." We Yinxi people, like all the people of the country, will never forgive them, we must destroy their nests, drag out these bad guys one by one, and uproot these poisonous weeds one by one.
    Deng Tuo and his gang dared to attack our Party, shouting that the Party should step down and "rest," that "nothing should be said, nothing should be done." Isn't this wanting to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and restore capitalism? These enemies have become extremely rampant, and we must give them a head-on blow. Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China; without the Communist Party, there would be no New Yinxi; without the Communist Party, there would be no new life for our poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Yinxi understand this truth most deeply. Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionaries oppressed us, and the landlord class exploited us. The peasants worked like oxen and horses all year round, but lived a miserable life of "sickles hanging on the wall, mouths hanging like hooks, half a year of bran and vegetables, half a year of grain." If it weren't for the Communist Party leading us in the revolution, how could we poor people have turned over and been liberated? After liberation, it was the Communist Party that led us to organize and embark on the happy road of collectivization; in the 1957 anti-Rightist struggle, it was the Communist Party that led us to smash the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists; in 1961, when monsters and demons took advantage of our natural disasters and stirred up a wave of individual farming, it was the Communist Party that led us to smash their conspiracies. Under the education of the Party, and through the tempering of this series of class struggles, the cadres and commune members of Yinxi understand that only under the leadership of the Party, and by resolutely carrying the socialist revolution through to the end, can the working people firmly secure their country. The Party also led us to build a new socialist countryside step by step in accordance with the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program. Ten years is not a long time, but Yinxi has undergone tremendous changes. Grain output has increased 2.7 times, and the total output value of agriculture and sideline industries has also increased more than 2 times. At the beginning of liberation, Yinxi, with a population of more than 3,000, had to be supplied with more than 200,000 jin of grain by the state every year. Now the population has increased to more than 5,000, and more than 2 million jin of surplus grain are sold to the state every year; at that time, more than 700 out of 800 households lacked food and clothing, but now more than 1,000 households of commune members are well-fed and well-clothed, and more than 500 households of commune members have built new houses. May I ask, without the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how could Yinxi have such earth-shaking changes? We are infinitely grateful to the Party, love the Party, and loyally support the Party's leadership, just like the poor and lower-middle peasants say: "When we pick up a bowl of white rice, we think of the Party; when we cover ourselves with a new cotton quilt, we think of the Party; when we walk into a new house, we think of the Party; when we recall the changes in Yinxi, we think of the Party; when we see the great progress of socialist construction in the country, we think of the Party; when we hear about the great development of the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, we think of the Party." We cannot be without the Party's leadership for a single moment. This gang of blackguards, Deng Tuo, wants to overthrow the leadership of our Party and restore capitalism and feudalism, which means that we will have to live the life of oxen and horses again. This is absolutely impossible. We Yinxi peasants will not let you go, and the people of the whole country will never let you go.
    Deng Tuo attacked the Great Leap Forward as "bragging" and "boasting," vainly trying to stop our peasants from adhering to the general line and hindering us from continuing the Great Leap Forward. This is a daydream! Who doesn't know that because we implemented the Party's general line in 1958, and the broad masses carried forward the revolutionary spirit, we achieved an all-round Great Leap Forward in the national economy, and earth-shaking changes took place throughout the country. Take our Fuqing for example. In the past, we had drought nine years out of ten. Production continued to change after liberation, but until before 1957, the state still had to transfer tens of millions of jin of grain every year. Since 1958, with the implementation of the general line, the establishment of people's communes, and the construction of the Dongzhang Reservoir with the spirit of the Great Leap Forward, the face of our area has changed rapidly. At present, we have changed from a grain-deficient area to a surplus area, and every year more than ten million jin of grain are transferred to the state. In Yinxi, after the Great Leap Forward, 48 irrigation canals and 7 pumping stations were built, more than 4,000 mu of land were leveled, and road networks, power transmission networks were built, and various team-run enterprises were established. Schools, hospitals, clubs were built..., is this "boasting" and "bragging"? Do you dare to come to Yinxi to take a look and have a debate with us face to face? You attack the Party's general line, and we must hold the red flag of the general line even higher.
    Deng Tuo also said that we "do not cherish labor power," which is simply lying with open eyes. Before the Great Leap Forward, Fuqing spent several million workdays on drought resistance every year. After the Dongzhang Reservoir was built, this labor force was saved. Since Yinxi realized gravity irrigation, the transportation of heavy materials has been changed to using flatbed carts, and the processing of agricultural products has been mechanized, saving 70,000 to 80,000 workdays a year. Precisely because of this, we can use the large number of laborers saved to cultivate intensively and increase the area of multiple cropping, changing the entire team's 5,000 mu of land from two crops to three crops, increasing the grain yield per mu by one time, reaching 1,500 to 1,600 jin. Today, we Yinxi peasants "don't have to worry about drought, don't need oil for lighting, don't have to carry grain, and don't need a mortar for milling rice." These days have only come after the Great Leap Forward. These iron facts show that the Party cherishes the labor force of the peasants most, and cares about the long-term interests of the peasants everywhere.
    Deng Tuo also falsely said that self-reliance is "too reluctant." May I ask, what can a poor and blank country like ours rely on if we don't rely on self-reliance and hard work? In the past few years, the Party and Chairman Mao have called on us to follow the road of the people of Dazhai. We have become richer and richer, and our lives have become better and better. Today, not only has Yinxi changed its face, but also thousands of communes and brigades across the country and the province have changed their faces. We believe that if we continue to follow this road of self-reliance, the face of the new socialist countryside will surely undergo tremendous changes. This group of people, Deng Tuo, doesn't want us to take the road of self-reliance, which is to oppose our building socialism. This is absolutely impossible. We must not only build socialism in the whole country and carry the socialist revolution through to the end, but also support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world and carry the world revolution through to the end!
    We increasingly feel that this Cultural Revolution, which is rising all over the country, is a top priority matter concerning the fate of all the people of China and the world. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon to resolutely open fire on Deng Tuo's black gang and all monsters and demons, and thoroughly destroy their anti-Party and anti-people nests.

### 一定要把总路线的红旗举得更高

    这场社会主义文化大革命，是关系到全中国和全世界人民命运的头等大事，我们一定要用毛泽东思想为武器，坚决向“三家村”黑帮和一切牛鬼蛇神开火，要彻底捣毁反党反人民的黑暗巢穴
    一定要把总路线的红旗举得更高
    福建省福清县音西公社音西大队总支书记　陈德顺
    我们从报上看到邓拓、廖沫沙、吴晗等人反党反社会主义的罪行，感到怒不可遏。连日来，音西的田头、村头以及各种座谈会上，大家愤怒谴责这伙黑帮反党反社会主义的罪行。社员们都说，我们辛辛苦苦种出了白米养活他们，他们却替资本主义和现代修正主义出力，这真是“养鼠咬布袋”。我们音西人和全国人民一样，绝不饶恕他们，一定要捣毁他们的巢穴，把这些坏家伙一个个揪出来，把毒草一株株连根拔掉。
    邓拓一伙竟然胆敢攻击我们党，叫喊什么要党下台“休息”，“什么话都不要说，什么事情都不能做”。这不是要推翻共产党的领导，让资本主义复辟吗？这伙敌人已经猖狂到了极点，我们要给他们迎头痛击。没有共产党，就没有新中国，没有共产党，就没有新音西，没有共产党，就没有我们贫下中农的新生活，这道理我们音西贫下中农体会最深。解放前，国民党反动派压迫我们，地主阶级剥削我们，农民一年到头做牛做马，却过着“镰刀挂壁嘴挂钩、半年糠菜半年粮”的悲惨生活。要不是共产党领导我们闹革命，我们穷人那能翻身解放？解放后，领导我们组织起来走上集体化幸福大道的是共产党；一九五七年反右派斗争中，领导我们粉碎地富反坏右分子破坏活动的是共产党；一九六一年牛鬼蛇神趁我们遭受自然灾害，煽起单干风时，领导我们粉碎他们阴谋活动的也是共产党。在党的教育下，经过这一连串阶级斗争的锻炼，音西的干部社员懂得，只有在党的领导下，坚决把社会主义革命进行到底，劳动人民才能坐稳江山。党还领导我们按照全国农业发展纲要四十条，一步步建设社会主义新农村。十多年的时间不算长，可是音西却发生了巨大的变化，粮食产量增加了二倍七，农副业总产值也增加二倍多。解放初，三千多人口的音西，每年还要国家供应二十多万斤粮食，现在人口增到五千多，每年还有二百多万斤余粮卖给国家；那时八百多户人家有七百多户缺吃少穿，现在一千多户社员吃饱穿暖，其中五百多户社员修盖了新房子。试问不是共产党和毛主席领导，音西那能有这样翻天覆地的变化？我们无限感激党，热爱党，忠诚地拥护党的领导，就象贫下中农们说的那样：“拿起白米饭想起党，盖上新棉被想起党，走进新房子想起党，回忆音西的变化想起党，看到国家社会主义建设大进步想起党，听到世界人民革命斗争大发展想起党。”我们一时一刻也不能没有党的领导。邓拓这批黑帮，要想推翻我们党的领导，搞资本主义、封建主义复辟，就是要我们再去过牛马生活，这万万办不到，我们音西农民不放过你们，全国人民也绝不放过你们。
    邓拓攻击大跃进是“说大话”“吹牛皮”，妄想要我们农民不要坚持总路线，阻挠我们继续大跃进，这是白日做梦！谁不知道由于我们在一九五八年贯彻了党的总路线，广大群众发扬了革命精神，才实现了国民经济的全面大跃进，全国各地都起了翻天覆地的变化。就拿我们福清来说，过去十年九旱，解放后生产不断变化，但是直到一九五七年前，每年还要国家调进几千万斤粮食，自从一九五八年贯彻总路线，办起人民公社，并以大跃进精神建起了东张水库后，我们这里的面貌迅速起了大变化，目前由缺粮变余粮，每年都有千多万斤粮食上调给国家。我们音西在大跃进后就兴建了四十八条灌溉渠道，七个抽水机站，平整了四千多亩土地，还修建了道路网、输电网，兴办了各种队办企业，盖起了学校、医院、俱乐部……，这难道是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”吗？你们这伙人敢不敢到音西来看一看，和我们当面辩论一场呢？你们攻击党的总路线，我们就一定要把总路线的红旗举得更高。
    邓拓还说我们“不爱护劳动力”，这简直是睁着眼睛说瞎话。大跃进前，我们福清每年花在抗旱上的劳动力要有几百万个工，东张水库修成后，这批劳力就省下来了。我们音西自从实现了自流灌溉，笨重物资运输改用板车，农产品加工实现机械化后，一年就节省七八万个劳力。正因为这样，我们才可以把节省下来的大批劳力用来精耕细作，增加复种面积，把全队五千来亩地由两熟改为三熟，使每亩地的粮食产量翻了一番，达到一千五六百斤。今天我们音西农民“大旱不用愁，点灯不用油，运粮不用挑，碾米不用臼。”这日子都是大跃进后才有的。这些铁的事实说明，党最爱惜农民的劳动力，处处关心农民的长远利益。
    邓拓还胡说自力更生是“过于勉强”，请问，象我们这样一穷二白的国家，不靠自力更生，艰苦奋斗，我们靠什么呢？几年来，党和毛主席号召我们走大寨人之路，我们是越走越富，日子越过越好。今天不但我们音西改变了面貌，全国全省千万个公社、大队也都改变了面貌。我们相信，顺着这条自力更生的道路走下去，社会主义新农村的面貌一定还要发生巨大的变化。邓拓这批人不要我们走自力更生道路，就是要反对我们建设社会主义，这是绝对办不到的。我们不但要在全国建设社会主义，把社会主义革命进行到底，还要支持全世界人民的革命斗争，把世界革命进行到底！
    我们越来越感到，正在全国各地兴起的这场文化大革命，是关系到全中国和全世界人民命运的头等大事。我们一定要用毛泽东思想为武器，坚决向邓拓黑帮和一切牛鬼蛇神开火，把他们的反党反人民的巢穴彻底捣毁。
