    According to Xinhua News Agency, May 25th – Vice Premier of the State Council He Long hosted a banquet tonight to warmly celebrate the success of the 1966 Emerging Forces Weightlifting Invitation Tournament, and to bid farewell to the personnel, representatives, and observers of the weightlifting delegations from various countries and regions who participated in the invitation tournament.

    Vice Premier He Long spoke at the banquet. He first extended the warmest congratulations on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people to friends and comrades from Asia, Africa, and Europe. He said that under the guidance of the spirit of enhancing friendship, promoting each other, developing together, and uniting against imperialism, this invitation tournament was well organized, achieved excellent results, and exchanged experiences. It contributed to promoting the development of weightlifting in the world, especially strengthening the friendly exchanges and unity against imperialism among the people and athletes of various countries.

    Vice Premier He Long said that for many years, international sports activities have been monopolized and controlled by imperialism and new and old colonialism headed by the United States. They acted arbitrarily, obstructed friendly exchanges between athletes from various countries, and interfered in the sports affairs of people from various countries. However, where there is oppression, there is resistance. In this invitation tournament, many delegations broke through the numerous obstacles set by imperialism, resolutely came to Beijing to participate in the competition, and decided to establish a Liaison Committee for the Emerging Forces Weightlifting Competition to further strengthen unity and cooperation and the cause of anti-imperialism, and to continue holding the competition forever. We express our admiration and firm support for everyone’s spirit of not fearing violence and daring to struggle.

    Vice Premier He Long emphasized that at present, the situation of the world's people's struggle against imperialism headed by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership group, and reactionaries of various countries is very good. The national democratic liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America continue to surge, and the anti-American anger is raging around the world. The victorious struggle of the Vietnamese people against American aggression and for national salvation has once again shattered the myth of the invincibility of American imperialism. Facts have repeatedly proved that American imperialism is a paper tiger that looks strong but is actually weak. As long as the people of the world unite and persist in struggle, imperialism will surely be defeated.

    Attending the banquet were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Song Yiping, Deputy Directors of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission Rong Gaotang and Li Menghua, Vice Mayor of Beijing Cui Yueli, and Chairman of the Organizing Committee of this invitation tournament and Chairman of the Chinese Weightlifting Association Zhong Shitong.

    Envoys and diplomatic officials of relevant countries stationed in China, Rashid Saeed Jarbu, Director of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Beijing Office, Kinkazu Saionji, a Japanese peace activist in Beijing, were invited to attend the banquet. (Attached picture)

    贺龙副总理举行宴会庆祝新兴力量举重赛成功
    据新华社二十五日讯　国务院副总理贺龙今晚举行宴会，热烈庆祝一九六六年新兴力量举重邀请赛的成功，并且欢送参加邀请赛的各国和地区举重代表团人员、代表和观察员。
    贺龙副总理在宴会上讲了话。他首先代表中国政府和中国人民，向来自亚洲、非洲和欧洲的朋友和同志们表示最热烈的祝贺。他说，在增进友好、互相促进、共同发展、团结反帝的精神指导下，这次邀请赛办得很好，创造了优良的成绩，交流了经验，对促进世界举重运动的发展，特别是加强各国人民和运动员之间的友好往来和团结反帝事业作出了贡献。
    贺龙副总理说，多年来，国际体育活动被以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义垄断和控制着。他们横行霸道，阻挠各国运动员进行友好交往，干涉各国人民的体育事务。但是，哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗。这一次邀请赛，许多代表团冲破了帝国主义设置的重重障碍，毅然地来到北京参加比赛，并且决定成立新兴力量举重比赛联络委员会，以进一步加强团结合作和反帝事业，把比赛永远办下去。对于大家这种不畏强暴、敢于斗争的精神，我们表示钦佩和坚决的支持。
    贺龙副总理强调指出，目前，世界人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争形势很好。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主解放运动在继续高涨，全世界的反美怒潮汹涌澎湃。越南人民抗美救国的胜利斗争，又一次粉碎了美帝国主义不可战胜的鬼话。事实一再证明，美帝国主义是一只外强中干的纸老虎。只要全世界人民团结起来，坚持斗争，帝国主义是一定能够被打败的。
    出席宴会作陪的，有外交部副部长姬鹏飞，对外文化联络委员会副主任宋一平，国家体育运动委员会副主任荣高棠、李梦华，北京市副市长崔月犁，这次邀请赛组织委员会主席、中国举重协会主席钟师统等。
