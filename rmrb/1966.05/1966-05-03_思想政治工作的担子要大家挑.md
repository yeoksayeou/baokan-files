    Everyone Should Shoulder the Responsibility of Ideological and Political Work
    Zhang Dianji, Party Branch Secretary of Fada People’s Commune, Changfa Brigade, Longjiang County, Heilongjiang Province
    Since I became the branch secretary, I have often pondered that if we want to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, we must strengthen ideological and political work and constantly carry out the struggle of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology among the masses. Because only when the awareness of the commune members is raised can they have more enthusiasm, further consolidate the collective economy, and produce more grain to support the socialist construction of the country and the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. Therefore, in the past few years, I have never relaxed ideological and political work.
    To do a good job in ideological and political work and realize the ideological revolutionization of people, it is impossible to rely on one or two cadres. This requires the branch secretary to rely on the branch committee members and all party members. If the branch secretary does not fully recognize the arduousness and complexity of this task, and does not handle the relationship between himself and the committee members well, the phenomenon of the branch secretary singing a "solo show" and the branch committee members having nothing to do may occur. I also took a detour in this regard. Without mentioning the distant past, let’s just take an event from the year before last as an example: After the Grain in Ear season, some plots in our brigade had incomplete seedlings. At that time, some branch committee members did not grasp the work tightly enough, and I was very anxious. I thought to myself: Changfa Brigade has increased production for two consecutive years. This year the drought is so severe, how can we continue to increase production? In a moment of impulse, I felt that the most effective way was to take over all the work myself. From then on, I personally handled everything. As a result, not only did the work not get done well, but the problems became more and more numerous. I went to the Sixth Team to grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works, and the study in the Seventh and Eighth Teams was interrupted; I was solving the problem of disunity among cadres in the Second Team, and before it was resolved, the livestock captain of the Seventh Team had a disagreement with someone again, making me feel overwhelmed all day long. Later, I simply went to work in the Eighth Team, but this was also not good. If commune members had a quarrel, they would run eight miles to find me to resolve it. What to do? I couldn't think of a solution no matter how hard I tried. One evening, I was walking back after a meeting in the Fourth Team, and branch committee member Comrade Lao Li heard me sighing, so he said to me: "Lao Zhang, the reason there are so many problems is not because of anything else, but because you didn't mobilize everyone well!" The Party Committee leader working in our brigade also instructed me: "Ideological and political work should not only be done by the branch secretary, but also rely on the branch committee members and all party members."
    Bearing in mind the shortcomings pointed out by the leaders and comrades, I studied Chairman Mao's "Methods of Work of Party Committees" and the rights and obligations of party members in the Party Constitution with the party members, and asked the comrades to criticize my work style. The comrades said: "Our Changfa has four villages, nine teams, and over two thousand people. How can it work if you do the work alone?" "To do ideological work, you have to grasp living thoughts. Men, women, old and young have different thoughts. How can one person fully understand the ideological situation of the commune members? If you want to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, you have to rely on everyone to do the work." At the same time, the branch committee members also examined their own shortcomings. Comrade Cai Fengxiang said: "It is not right for the branch secretary to take care of everything, but it is also not right for the branch committee members to be dependent on others when encountering problems and hand them over to superiors. In the future, everyone should jointly shoulder the responsibility of ideological and political work."
    This meeting gave me a profound education and made me feel that the reason why the work was not successful in the previous period was not only a matter of method, but also a matter of whether or not to believe in the collective and follow the mass line. The ultimate goal of doing ideological and political work is to raise the ideological awareness of party members and the masses and improve work and production. How can this be done well without relying on the collective and mobilizing the majority of people? From then on, whenever I encountered important problems, I would first analyze the situation at the branch committee meeting, discuss solutions, then put forward requirements, and go about it separately. In the past, the work in the Fifth Team was relatively weak. I thought that the captain and branch committee member Lin Qingshan was weak in ability, and I did not dare to let go in using him. Unexpectedly, after the branch committee meeting, he returned to the team and organized the masses to study Chairman Mao's works. Through study, many problems were solved. From then on, the name "backward team" was never called again. This incident greatly educated me and made me realize that as long as we believe in the masses and rely on the masses, the work of the branch can be done well.

    思想政治工作的担子要大家挑
    黑龙江省龙江县发达公社长发大队党支部书记　张殿吉
    我做支部书记工作以来，就常琢磨，要想把群众的积极性调动起来，就得加强思想政治工作，经常在群众中进行兴无产阶级思想、灭资产阶级思想的斗争。因为社员觉悟提高了，干劲才能更足，才能进一步巩固集体经济，才能生产更多的粮食，支援国家社会主义建设和世界人民的革命斗争。所以几年来，自己始终没有放松思想政治工作。
    要做好思想政治工作，实现人的思想革命化，凭一两个干部是办不到的，这就要求支部书记依靠支部委员和全体党员去做。如果支部书记不充分认识这项任务的艰巨性和复杂性，不处理好自己和委员们的关系，就可能出现支部书记唱“独角戏”、支部委员们没事干的现象。我在这方面也走过一段弯路。远的不提，就拿前年的一件事来说吧：芒种以后，我们大队有些地块苗不全，当时有的支部委员对工作抓的不够紧，我心里挺着急。心想：长发大队连着两年增产，今年旱的这样厉害，怎样才能继续增产呢？脑子一热，就觉着最解渴的办法是自己把工作都抓过来。打这，不管啥事我都亲自去办，结果工作不仅没做好，问题反而越弄越多。我去六队抓学习毛主席著作，七队、八队学习中断了；我在二队解决干部不团结问题，还没解决好，七队畜牧队长又和人闹意见了，弄得我整天手忙脚乱。后来自己干脆到八队去干活，可是这样也不行，社员闹口角，跑八里地来找我给解决。咋办呢？我左思右想想不出个办法来。一天晚上，我在四队开完会往回走，支部委员老李同志听我打唉声，便跟我说：“老张啊，问题多不怪别的，就是因为你没很好地发动大伙呀！”在我们大队工作的党委领导同志也嘱咐我：“思想政治工作不仅要支部书记做，而且要依靠支部委员和全体党员去做。”
    我带着领导和同志们指出的缺点，同党员一起学习了毛主席的《党委会的工作方法》和党章中党员的权利、义务，并请同志们对我的工作作风进行批评。同志们说：“咱们长发四个屯，九个队，两千来口人，凭你一个人去做工作，那能行呢？”“做思想工作要抓活思想，男女老少想啥各有不同，光一个人怎么能够全面了解社员的思想情况呢？要想把群众的积极性都调动起来，就得依靠大家去做工作。”同时支部委员们也检查了自己的缺点。蔡风祥同志说：“支部书记遇事包办不对，可是支部委员遇事依赖，有问题就往上交也不对。今后，大家应当共同把思想政治工作的担子担起来。”
    这次会议，使我受到一次深刻的教育，感到前段工作没抓上去，不仅是方法问题，也是相信不相信集体，走不走群众路线的问题。做思想政治工作的目的，归根到底是提高党员、群众的思想觉悟，把工作、生产搞上去，这不依靠集体、不发动多数人去做怎么能搞好呢。打这，自己再碰到重要问题，便首先在支委会上分析情况，商定办法，然后提出要求，分头去办。过去五队工作比较薄弱，我认为队长、支部委员林青山能力弱，对他使用不敢放手。没想到，开完支委会以后，他回队就组织群众学习毛主席著作。通过学习，解决了很多问题。从此“落后队”的名字再也没人叫了。这件事对我教育很大，使我认识到，只要相信群众，依靠群众，支部的工作就能够做好。
