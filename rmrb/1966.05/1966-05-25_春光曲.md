    Spring Song
    Warrior Zhong Qiwei
    Green branches and leaves fill the eyes, peach blossoms red like fire reflect the blue sky;
    Spring arrives, intoxicating people, the scenery is even more beautiful, joyfully watching colorful flags on the mountain peaks.
    Red flags are bright on the training ground, battle cries are like thunder, blades flash,
    Red flags lead out clusters of fire, flames burn red the heavens and earth.
    A cluster of fire, a heart, the flames connect into a large expanse;
    A single spark can start a prairie fire, the east wind rolls, everyone laughs and says it is a good spring!
    Spring is good, spring is good, songs of killing the enemy shake the mountains and rivers;
    Press down the saxaul to avenge, shoot out the arrow of human justice!
    Spring is good, spring is good, the people's warriors are determined,
    Smiling, watching the mountain filled with flowers bloom, the red flowers on the target are even more vibrant.
    Red flowers bloom, a red expanse, the warriors’ heroic feelings smile and speak:
    “It is not that this year's spring came early, the warriors all have spring in their hearts.”
    The warriors all have spring in their hearts, looking out at the world's changing situation,
    Revolutionary vigor is endless, "Quotations from Chairman Mao" are by their side.

    春光曲
    战士　钟其纬青枝绿叶入眼帘，桃红似火映蓝天；春来人醉景更美，喜看彩旗上峰巅。练兵场上红旗鲜，杀声如雷刀光闪，红旗引出团团火，火焰烧红天地间。一团火，一颗心，火光连成一大片；星火燎原东风滚，人人笑说好春天！春天好，好春天，杀敌歌声震山川；压上梭梭复仇火，射出人间正义箭！春天好，好春天，人民战士决心坚，笑看满山百花开，靶上红花更鲜艳。红花开，红一片，战士豪情笑开言：“不是今年春来早，战士心里皆春天。”战士心里皆春天，放眼世界风云变，革命劲头无穷尽，《毛主席语录》在身边。
