    The Masses Armed with Mao Zedong Thought are a True Wall of Iron
    Basang (Tibetan, female), Deputy County Chief of Lang County, Tibet Autonomous Region

    With the Thought of Serving the People, One Dares to Shoulder Even the Heaviest Burdens

    I was born into a slave family and started engaging in heavy slave labor at the age of nine. In the feudal serf system, I was regarded by the three major estate-holders as a talking livestock. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who rescued me from hell on earth. In order to cultivate and educate me, the Party sent me to a school in the interior in 1957. After the suppression of the rebellion in 1959, I returned to Tibet to participate in the vigorous democratic reform movement. After this struggle, I gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. In the autumn of 1960, the organization transferred me to work in Lang County. Lang County is a border county with a complex situation. Enemies outside the border spread rumors, and the class enemies within the territory were unwilling to accept their demise. I felt that I was not capable of doing a good job in the border area. At the same time, I also considered that the influence of the Party and Chairman Mao was very profound in the border area. If I did not do a good job, it would directly affect the prestige of the Party and Chairman Mao. Therefore, I felt a great responsibility. In the spring of 1962, when the organization asked me to serve as the deputy director of the county women's federation, I felt even more daunted. At that time, the leading comrades of the county party committee said to me: As long as you listen to Chairman Mao and act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. Ability is honed in actual struggle. Learning in actual struggle is very good learning; to serve the people, one must pick up the heavy burden to shoulder. After listening to these words, I felt that what the leading comrades said was right. The Party handed me a heavy burden, which was trust in me and a test for me. However, when I had just become familiar with women's work, I was elected as the deputy county chief and a member of the Lang County Party Committee in the autumn of 1965 during the general election. At this time, I felt pressure in my mind again. I am a liberated slave who has not been working for long and has not been tempered. The burden is not light. Under such circumstances, I studied Chairman Mao's works again. Chairman Mao said: "Arduous work is like a burden placed before us, to see if we dare to take it up. ... Pick the heaviest burden to shoulder, suffer before others, and enjoy after others. Such comrades are good comrades." Chairman Mao also said: "Some things we are familiar with are about to be idled, and things we are not familiar with are forcing us to do them." These words are so true! I have begun to be familiar with women's work, and now the Party wants me to serve as the deputy county chief of the border county, which I am not familiar with. But the revolution needs it, so we must bravely overcome difficulties and turn the "pressure" in our minds into a driving force for our progress. Under the teachings of Chairman Mao and with the help of comrades, over the past few years, I have conscientiously studied and implemented the Party's policies on border defense work and have initially mastered the basic skills for doing a good job in border work.

    Arm the Masses with Mao Zedong Thought to Form a True Wall of Iron

    I tasted the sweetness and received the results of studying Chairman Mao's works. But I thought that it was not enough for me to learn well alone. I also had to organize and lead the masses to learn. Therefore, I made organizing the masses to study Chairman Mao's works my primary task in my work in the countryside. Lang County has a total of twenty-six townships, and I have been to eighteen of them. Wherever I have been, I have organized the masses to study Chairman Mao's works. I also helped the masses set up people's schools and night schools. I have bought Chairman Mao's works and literacy textbooks for the masses in eighteen townships. I have not personally been to three townships, but I heard that the masses there asked to learn culture and study Chairman Mao's works, so I bought Chairman Mao's works and literacy textbooks for them. When I went to Semu Township to work, I found that the young people in this township wanted to make progress but were not organized. So, I helped them set up a night school, which has been running since 1962 and still continues to this day. Sometimes, I haven't been to this township for a long time, and the young people there come to the county to do business and also report to me on their studies and send me their study notes. Now, the young people in that township have all made progress, can read newspapers, can read Chairman Mao's books, and can also tutor the masses to study. The awareness of the masses in this township is also constantly improving, and the Party's policies have been better implemented.

    In the winter of 1965, our county was going to build a highway. Before the democratic reform, transportation in our county was blocked, and the economy and culture were behind other places. After the democratic reform, although production has developed greatly, it is still difficult to carry out other construction due to inconvenient transportation. After this highway is opened, it will not only be of great benefit to the production and construction of the people of Lang County, but more importantly, it will play a major role in defending the border and consolidating national defense. The county party committee sent me to lead more than 1,500 migrant workers from the county to build the highway. The task of building the road was both arduous and glorious, and I felt a heavy burden. But I have accumulated an important experience in my previous work, which is to arm the people with Mao Zedong Thought and do a good job in human work.

    In the course of building the road, we encountered a hard mountain wall, and dozens of migrant workers worked hard to blast rocks for more than ten days without blasting it away. At this time, some people were discouraged. But the task of building the road was very urgent. Under such circumstances, I organized the migrant workers to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Some migrant workers said: The Foolish Old Man only had his family, and they all had the determination to move the mountains. We are liberated serfs and have the leadership of the Party. Are we not as good as an old Foolish Old Man? Seeing that everyone's energy was boosted, I proposed to organize a shock team, and the migrant workers all raised their hands to sign up to participate. After the shock team was organized, the work efficiency was nearly doubled compared to the past. It only took four days to break through this mountain wall.

    In this road construction, 150 migrant workers came from Jindong District, the border area. Due to the rumors and deceptions of class enemies, some migrant workers were not stable. To deal with these people, on the one hand, I carried out class education comparing the old and new societies, and on the other hand, I organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works. Most of the migrant workers were from poor serfs and slaves, and everyone had a bellyful of the suffering of the old society. Lang County in the old society was hell on earth. Serfs could not afford zanba, so they used wild vegetables to cook tuba to fill their hunger. If they didn't have pulu to wear, they wore animal skins. Many poor serfs and slaves wore a monkey skin for a lifetime. They couldn't afford salt and couldn't drink tea. Some families drank a piece of tuocha for three years, and some picked leaves and peeled bark to boil as tea. Today's Lang County, more than 13,000 mu of land, about 60% of the land can be irrigated by gravity, and grain production increases year after year. Among the 1,930 households in the county, more than 1,480 households have achieved self-sufficiency in grain or have surplus. The migrant workers recalled the suffering of the old society and thought of the sweetness of today, and they were very grateful to the Party and Chairman Mao. Hearing that they were going to be organized to study Chairman Mao's works, everyone was very enthusiastic. Some said: In the past, I only knew that Chairman Mao was good, but we didn't know what Chairman Mao said. We must listen to Chairman Mao and open our minds. During the day's rest, I would tell the migrant workers "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." In the evening, the migrant workers gathered in the tents, lit pine oil branches, and asked me to tell them about Chairman Mao's books. While listening, they discussed and guaranteed to build the highway well. A squadron organized by 150 migrant workers in Jindong District overcame various difficulties in carrying construction tools and materials, ensuring the needs of the front construction site. Some migrant workers got blisters on their feet when carrying materials, but they did not complain. After working all day, they secretly went to carry materials at night. Because of their active work, they received a moving red flag in the first evaluation. In the process of building the highway, their class consciousness was constantly improved, and they realized that building the highway was for the revolution, and blasting stone walls and carrying materials were all struggles with domestic and foreign reactionaries, giving full play to their high enthusiasm, and no difficulties could stop them.

    Through this period of organizing the masses to study Chairman Mao's works, I once again realized that Chairman Mao's books are the most unifying and inspiring to the masses; Chairman Mao's words have the highest prestige, the greatest power, and the most effective results. Using Chairman Mao's books to educate the masses can accomplish even the most arduous tasks. Arming the people with Mao Zedong Thought is the best preparation for war and can form a true wall of iron.

    To Rely on the Masses, We Must Trust the Masses and Care for the Masses

    Once, I went to Zha Village, Lado Township, to mobilize the masses to rectify mutual aid teams. This small mountain village has only eight households. When I came to the village, I wanted to choose the poorest Zongba's family as my "Four Together" household. Who would have thought that when I went to her house, she didn't welcome me and said that her house was small and asked me to live in a middle peasant's house. I said to her, "Chairman Mao said that we should discuss matters with the poor peasants. I live in your house so that I can discuss things with you." She smiled and said, "Since Chairman Mao said it, you can stay!" After I stayed in her house, I went to the mountains to chop firewood for her, and I went to the cowshed to dig manure for her, doing all kinds of work. Gradually, she was no longer so indifferent to me. She told me about the situation in the mutual aid team. In this mutual aid team, the middle peasants had the advantage, and the middle peasants had the say. The poor peasants were still bullied, and production was not good. Based on this situation, I convened a

    用毛泽东思想武装的群众是真正的铜墙铁壁
    西藏自治区朗县副县长　巴桑（藏族、女）
    有了为人民服务的思想，再重的担子也敢挑
    我出生在奴隶的家庭中，九岁开始从事沉重的奴隶劳动。在封建农奴制度的社会里，我被三大领主看成是一个会说话的牲畜。是党和毛主席把我从人间地狱里解救出来。党为了培养教育我，一九五七年把我送到内地学校里去学习。一九五九年平叛以后，我回到西藏参加了轰轰烈烈的民主改革运动。在这场斗争后，我光荣地加入了中国共产党。一九六○年秋，组织上把我调到朗县去工作。朗县是个边境县，情况复杂，境外敌人造谣，境内的阶级敌人也不甘心他们的灭亡。对于做好边境地区的工作，我深感没有能力。同时，我也考虑到，党和毛主席的影响，在边境地区是非常深远的，如果自己做不好工作，将会直接影响到党和毛主席的威信。因此，我感到自己的责任重大。一九六二年春，组织上要我担任县妇联副主任时，更感到畏难。当时，县委领导同志对我说：只要听毛主席的话，按毛主席的教导办事，就没有克服不了的困难。本领是在实际斗争中锻炼出来的。实际斗争中锻炼，就是很好的学习；为人民服务就要拣重担子挑。听了这些话，我觉得领导同志说的很对。党把重担子交给我，是对我的信任，也是对我的考验。可是，当我刚刚熟悉了妇女工作以后，一九六五年秋普选时，我被选为副县长，并参加中共朗县县委会为委员。这时，思想上又产生了压力。我是一个翻身的奴隶，参加工作不久，还未经过锻炼，担子是不轻的。在这种情况下，我又学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。……担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。”毛主席又说：“我们熟习
  的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西正在强迫我们去做。”这话说的真对！妇女工作我开始熟悉了，现在，党又要我担任边境县的副县长，我又不熟悉了。但革命需要，必须勇敢地去克服
  困难，必须把思想上的“压力”变成促使自己进步的动力。在毛主席的教导下，经过同志们的帮助，几年来，我认真学习贯彻执行党的有关边防工作的方针政策，初步掌握了做好边境工作的基本功。
    用毛主席思想武装群众，组成真正的铜墙铁壁
    我学习毛主席著作，尝到了甜头，收到了效果。但是我想，只我一个人学好还不行，还要组织带领群众学。为此，我把组织群众学毛主席著作，当做我下乡工作的首要任务。朗县共二十六个乡，我已经到过十八个乡，凡我到过的地方，我都组织群众学毛主席著作。我还帮助群众办起了民校、夜校。我给十八个乡的群众买过毛主席著作和识字课本，有三个乡我没亲自到过，但听说那里的群众要求学文化，学毛主席著作，我就为他们买了毛主席著作和识字课本。我到塞木乡去工作时，发现这个乡的青年要求进步，但没有组织起来。于是，我便帮助他们办起夜校，从一九六二年起，一直坚持办到现在。有时，我很久不到这个乡去，那里的青年们到县里来办事，还顺便向我汇报他们的学习情况，并送学习笔记给我看。现在，那个乡的青年都进步了，能看懂报纸，能读毛主席的书，还能辅导广大群众学习。这个乡的群众觉悟也在不断提高，党的方针政策得到了较好的贯彻执行。
    一九六五年冬，我们县要修筑一条公路。民主改革前，我们县的交通闭塞，经济文化比其他地方落后。民主改革以后，虽然生产有了很大发展，但由于交通不便，进行其他建设仍很困难。这条公路修通以后，不仅对朗县人民生产建设有极大的好处，而且更重要的是对保卫边疆、巩固国防会起到重大作用。县委派我带领全县一千五百多名民工去修筑公路。修路的任务又艰巨，又光荣，我深感担子重大。但我在以往的工作中积累了一条重要的经验，就是用毛泽东思想武装人民群众，做好人的工作。
    我们在修路中遇到一个坚硬的山壁，几十名民工开山炸石，干了十多天也没有把它炸掉。这时，有人泄气了。但修路任务又非常紧急。在这种情况下，我组织民工学习了《愚公移山》。有的民工说：愚公只有一家人，都有移山的决心。我们是翻身农奴，有党的领导，难道还不如个老愚公？我见大家的劲鼓起来了，就提议组织突击队，民工一齐举起手来报名参加。突击队组织起来以后，工效比过去提高将近一倍。仅用了四天的时间，就打通了这道山壁。
    在这次修路中，最边境的金东区来了一百五十名民工。由于阶级敌人造谣欺骗，有的民工的情绪安定不下来。对待这些人，我一方面对他们进行新旧社会对比的阶级教育，一方面组织大家学习毛主席的著作。民工中，大部分是贫苦农奴和奴隶出身，每个人都有一肚子旧社会的苦。旧社会的朗县，是人间地狱。农奴们吃不上糌粑，就用野菜熬土巴充饥。没有氆氇穿，就披兽皮，许多贫苦农奴和奴隶，一张猴皮穿一辈子。吃不上盐巴，喝不上茶。有的人家一块沱茶喝三年，有的就采树叶，剥树皮当茶熬。现在的朗县，一万三千多亩土地，约有百分之六十的土地可以自流灌溉，粮食年年增产，全县一千九百三十多户，已有一千四百八十多户达到粮食自给或者有余。民工回忆起旧社会的苦，想到了今天的甜，都非常感激党和毛主席。听说要组织他们学习毛主席的著作，个个情绪都很高。有的说：过去只知道毛主席好，但毛主席说了些什么话，我们并不知道。我们一定要听毛主席的话，开开窍。白天休息时，我就给民工讲《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》，到了晚上，民工们围在帐篷里，点上松油枝，还要求我给他们讲毛主席的书。他们一面听，一面议，保证修好公路。金东区的一百五十名民工组织的一个中队，在背运筑路工具和材料时，克服了种种困难，保证了前面工地的需要。有的民工在背运材料时，脚上起了水泡，也不叫苦。白天干一天，晚上还偷着去背运。由于他们工作积极，第一次评比即得到了流动红旗。在修公路的过程中，他们的阶级觉悟不断提高，认识到修公路就是为的革命，打石壁，背材料，都是同国内外反动派的斗争，发挥了高度的积极性，什么困难也挡不住他们。
    通过这一段组织群众学习毛主席著作，我又一次体会到，毛主席的书，是最能团结鼓舞群众的；毛主席的话，威信最高，威力最大，效果最灵，用毛主席的书去教育群众，再艰巨的任务也能完成；用毛主席思想去武装人民群众，就是最好的备战，就能组成真正的铜墙铁壁。
    要依靠群众，就要相信群众，关心群众
    有一次，我到拉多乡扎村去发动群众，整顿互助组。这个小山村，只有八户。我来到村里想选择最穷的宗巴家当我的“四同”户。谁想到，我到她家时，她不欢迎我，说她家的房子小，要我到一户中农家去住。我对她说：“毛主席说过，有事要同贫农商议，我住到你家，为的好和你商议事情。”她笑了，说：“既然是毛主席说的，你就住下吧！”我在她家住下以后，我上山给她打柴，到牛圈里为她挖肥，什么活都干。渐渐地她对我不再那么冷淡了。便向我讲了互助组内的情况。这个互助组，中农占了优势，中农说了算，贫农还受气，生产搞不好。根据这一情况，我召开了全组组员会，会上我引证毛主席的话说：“没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。”把毛主席的这些话一讲，贫苦农民组员扬眉吐气了，他们说：“有毛主席撑腰，我们一定把互助组整顿好！”从那次整顿以后，这个互助组一直办得很好。
    毛主席在《关于农业合作化问题》一文中说：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。”我并不是一开始就对毛主席的这个指示领会深透了。我到朗县不久，曾错误地认为，边境地区群众基础差，不敢放手发动群众，依靠群众。
    一九六三年全县进行普选时，我来到克朱乡搞点。下来之后，我认为原来写在候选人名单上的乡团支部书记央金是个“拔尖”的人物，工作很积极，她当选一定没问题。谁想到正式选举那天，她落选了。当时，我认为群众落后。事后经过详细了解，群众不选央金是有原因的。央金在领导面前看起来很积极，背后却和农奴主代理人勾勾搭搭。这样，不得不临时另补选一人。这件事发生以后，我重温了毛主席《关于领导方法的若干问题》这篇文章。认识到，发生这个问题的原因，是领导脱离群众。怎么办呢？是向群众作公开检讨呢？还是找客观原因呢？当时思想上有斗争：要检讨，怕丢人，怕别人说我主观；怕个人的威信受到影响。但又想到，如果不公开认错，党的威信就会受到影响，个人思想里的脏东西就见不了阳光，天长日久，渐渐就会发霉。于是，我在全乡选民会上作了检讨。群众说：“知错能改，真是共产党教导出来的好干部。”
    这件事使我认识到：在任何地方，任何情况下，都应当相信群众，相信党。朗县虽是边境地区，群众是相信党，相信毛主席的。这是做好一切工作的基础。我还体会到：依靠群众是建立在相信群众的基础上。只有真心实意地去为群众谋利益，关心群众的痛痒，才能发动起群众的积极性，才能得到群众的拥护。
