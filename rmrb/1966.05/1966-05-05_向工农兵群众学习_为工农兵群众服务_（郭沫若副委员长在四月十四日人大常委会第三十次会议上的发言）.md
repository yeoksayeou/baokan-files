    Learn from the Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, Serve the Workers, Peasants and Soldiers
   (Speech by Vice Chairman Guo Moruo at the 30th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on April 14)
    Due to time constraints, I will speak briefly.
    Comrade Shi Ximin's report (Note: Refers to Comrade Shi Ximin's report on the Socialist Cultural Revolution made at the 30th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress) has had a personal impact on me. To put it bluntly, it has caused me deep pain. Because in the eyes of ordinary friends and comrades, I am a cultural figure, and many even say I am a writer, a poet, and a historian. For decades, I have been writing and translating things, amounting to millions of words. However, according to today's standards, everything I have written before should be burned, as it has no value.
    What is the main reason? It is because I have not learned Mao Zedong Thought well, and have not used Mao Zedong Thought to arm myself. Therefore, my class viewpoint is sometimes very vague.
    Recently, in-depth criticism has been carried out in newspapers regarding literature and history, which is very good. I have read almost all of it. I am looking at it in connection with my own self-transformation, not as an outsider. Every article and every criticism almost touches on my own "life." I am not just saying this casually, it is indeed the case. I myself have not studied Mao Zedong Thought well, and have not transformed myself well.
    Of course, I am indeed a literary and art worker, and I am also the chairman of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles. I cannot say that I am not responsible for some of the unhealthy tendencies in literary and art circles. It has been more than twenty years since the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." I have read it many times, and sometimes I can even recite it, talking about serving the workers, peasants and soldiers, learning from the workers, peasants and soldiers, but it has only remained at the verbal level. Verbal Marxism-Leninism, paper Marxism-Leninism, has not been truly implemented, not practiced, not truly followed Chairman Mao's instructions, and not studied Mao Zedong Thought well.
    I am very ashamed. Chairman Mao taught us more than twenty years ago to serve the workers, peasants and soldiers. Today, it is not we who are serving the workers, peasants and soldiers, but the workers, peasants and soldiers who are serving us. Now the workers, peasants and soldiers study Chairman Mao's works and write better than us. Especially those of us who write, engage in literature and art, history, and philosophy, must deeply reflect. I myself feel very uncomfortable, and have really not transformed myself well.
    For example, the report mentioned "The Song of Ouyang Hai," which is an epoch-making novel. The author, Comrade Jin Jingmai, served as a soldier for many years and is now still working in the Guangdong Military Region Cultural Troupe. Because he served as a soldier for so many years, he was able to write "The Song of Ouyang Hai." I think this book is a must-read. Whoever here can find a copy of "The Song of Ouyang Hai," I recommend you read it carefully. He truly brought Ouyang Hai to life and brought Mao Zedong Thought to life. Comrade Ouyang Hai sacrificed himself in 1963. He incorporated almost all of the Party's policies and Chairman Mao's thought up to 1963 into this novel. It seems that today's so-called professional artists cannot write it. He is someone who has truly been through the mill in the army and has seen blood, and can write such a literary work. So, the soldiers are serving us, not we are serving the soldiers.
    The report mentioned the large-scale clay sculpture "Rent Collection Courtyard," which is the revolutionization of sculpture and is still on display in the art museum. I myself have seen it three times. It is very moving, and many viewers shed tears because they are reminded of their own history and touched by class feelings. It is indeed good, it is the story of the Liu family in Dayi, Sichuan. It is said that the original work in Dayi had one hundred and forty-six figures, but we only have sixty-some here, representing only a part, and it is already very moving. Hundreds of thousands of people have already seen it, and tickets for May are already sold out. If those of you here have not seen it, I think you should not miss this opportunity, you must see it and educate yourselves. A few days ago, a Japanese delegation, a delegation of artisans, met with me. The head of the delegation said that the first important thing we did in China was to see "Rent Collection Courtyard," and we gained a lot. Some of the Sichuan workers who created "Rent Collection Courtyard" came, I don't know if they are still here? They work in the back rooms of the exhibition hall, and I went to see them. They use straw to make the bones, cutting the straw into inch-long pieces and mixing it with mud, then applying it. The materials are very cheap. I think the flavor of clay sculpture is the best, more moving than plaster statues, marble statues, or white jade statues. Especially using mud to sculpt peasants, without having to get covered in mud, it is already covered in mud. "Rent Collection Courtyard" is indeed a very good masterpiece, it is the revolutionization of sculpture. The reason why it was able to succeed is that it grasped Chairman Mao's Thought and applied it flexibly. Flexible study and application, used in sculpture, has achieved epoch-making results. So the arrival of "Rent Collection Courtyard" has given Comrade Liu Kaiqu of the Beijing Central Academy of Fine Arts, and many others, a very good education. They worked with the workers to reproduce the sixty-some figures that are now on display. This is the workers serving us, and the workers educating us.
    In fact, many peasants study Chairman Mao's works better than any of us, much better than us intellectuals. We intellectuals, with our verbose philosophers, historians, and so-called experts, are simply not experts. Workers and peasants study much better than us. Last year when I went to Shanxi, I heard Comrade Zhou Mingshan (he is a peasant) talk about his experience in studying Chairman Mao's works, and it was truly lively and vivid. He is now the Secretary of the Jiangxian County Party Committee, and he is also a deputy to the National People's Congress.
    We are really ashamed, especially me, you may not be so ashamed. As a party member, and also a so-called expert, tears want to flow into my stomach. In short, we have not only not served the workers, peasants and soldiers, but on the contrary, the workers, peasants and soldiers have served us in literature, history, and philosophy. We should thank the workers, peasants and soldiers, and take the workers, peasants and soldiers as our teachers, because they have studied Chairman Mao's Thought well and applied it flexibly.
    My words today seem to be a statement, but it is indeed a statement of my state of mind, expressing what I want to say in my heart. Now I am: going to study hard from the workers, peasants and soldiers, and cannot talk about how to serve the workers, peasants and soldiers. Now I should study hard from the workers, peasants and soldiers, and take the workers, peasants and soldiers as my teachers. Although I am already in my seventies, I still have some ambition. That is to say, I am willing to get covered in mud; I am willing to get covered in oil stains; and even if I have to be stained with blood, if the American imperialists want to attack us, I am willing to throw a few grenades at the American imperialist elements. That is what I mean. Now I should study hard from the workers, peasants and soldiers, and if possible, serve the workers, peasants and soldiers well. (Attached pictures)

    向工农兵群众学习  为工农兵群众服务
   （郭沫若副委员长在四月十四日人大常委会第三十次会议上的发言）
    因为时间关系，简单地讲几句。
    石西民同志的报告（按：指石西民同志在人大常委会第三十次会议上所作的关于社会主义文化革命的报告），对我来说，是有切身的感受。说得沉痛一点，是有切肤之痛。因为在一般的朋友们、同志们看来，我是一个文化人，甚至于好些人都说我是一个作家，还是一个诗人，又是一个什么历史家。几十年来，一直拿着笔杆子在写东西，也翻译了一些东西。按字数来讲，恐怕有几百万字了。但是，拿今天的标准来讲，我以前所写的东西，严格地说，应该全部把它烧掉，没有一点价值。
    主要的原因是什么呢？就是没有学好毛主席思想，没有用毛主席思想来武装自己，所以，阶级观点有的时候很模糊。
    文史方面，近来在报纸上开展着深入的批评，这是很好的，我差不多都看了。我是联系到自我改造来看的，并不是隔岸观火。每一篇文章，每一个批评，差不多都要革到我自己的“命”上来。我不是在此地随便说，的确是这样，我自己就是没有把毛主席思想学好，没有把自己改造好。
    当然，我确实是一个文艺工作者，而且我还是文联的主席。文艺界上的一些歪风邪气，我不能说没有责任。毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表以来，已经二十几年了，我读过多少遍，有的时候也能拿到口头上来讲，要为工农兵服务啦，要向工农兵学习啦，但是，只是停留在口头上。口头上的马克思列宁主义，纸头上的马克思列宁主义，就是没有切实地做到，没有实践，没有真正照着毛主席的指示办事，没有把毛主席思想学好。
    惭愧得很。毛主席在二十多年前就教导我们，要我们为工农兵服务。今天不是我们在为工农兵服务，而是工农兵在为我们服务了。现在工农兵学习毛主席著作，写的东西比我们好。特别是我们拿笔杆子的人，搞文艺、搞历史、搞哲学的人，必须要深刻地反省。我自己感到很难受，实在没有改造好。
    比方，报告里讲到的《欧阳海之歌》，这是一部划时代的小说。作者金敬迈同志当了好几年兵，现在还在广东部队文工团里工作。因为他当了多少年的兵，所以他才能写出《欧阳海之歌》来。这本书，我看是非读不可。今天在座的，无论那一位能够想办法找到一本《欧阳海之歌》，我推荐各位好好地读它一遍。他真把欧阳海写活了，把毛主席的思想写活了。欧阳海同志是一九六三年牺牲的。他把一直到一九六三年止，所有的党的方针、政策，把主席的思想，差不多都容纳在这一部长篇小说里面。看来，今天所谓专业文艺家，事实上是写不出来的。他是真正在部队里滚了一身血迹的人，才写得出这样的文艺作品来。所以，兵在为我们服务了，不是我们在为兵服务。
    报告里提到大型泥塑《收租院》，是雕塑的革命化，现在还在美术馆展览。我自己看了三遍。那是很感动人的，有好多观众看了流眼泪，因为他们联想到自己的历史，触动了阶级感情。的确是好，那是我们四川大邑刘家的故事。据说在大邑原来的作品有一百四十六个人物，我们这里只有六十几个，只表现了一部分，已经很感动人了。已经有好几十万群众去看了，现在五月份的门票都卖光了。在座的各位如果还没有去看的话，我看不要把这个机会错过，必须去看，也使我们自己受一次教育。前几天有一个日本代表团，他们是搞工艺的代表团，我同他们见面的时候，代表团的团长就讲，我们到中国来的第一件大事，就是看了《收租院》，收获很大。搞《收租院》的一部分四川工人来了，不知道现在还在不在？他们在展览馆的后房里面工作，我去看了。他们就是用稻草做骨头，把稻草切成一寸长的样子，用泥巴和在里面，然后敷上去。材料是很便宜的。我看泥塑的味道再好也没有，比石膏象，比大理石象，比汉白玉雕象都感动人。特别是用泥巴来塑农民，用不着滚一身泥巴，它就是一身泥巴。《收租院》的确是很好的杰作，是雕塑的革命化。它之所以能成功的原因，就是把主席思想掌握到了，活用了主席的思想。活学活用，用在雕塑上来，便收到了划时代的成果。所以《收租院》一来，使得我们北京中央美术学院的刘开渠同志，还有好些人，受到了一次很好的教育。他们都同工人一道工作，仿塑了六十几尊现在陈列的人物。这是工人在为我们服务了，工人教育了我们。
    事实上很多农民学毛主席著作比我们任何人学得都好，比我们这些知识分子学得好得多。我们这些知识分子，夸夸其谈的什么哲学家、史学家、什么家，简直不成家。工人、农民比我们学得好得多。我去年去山西，听到周明山同志（他是农民）讲起学习毛主席著作的体会，那真是生动活泼。他现在是绛县县委书记，他也是人大代表。
    我们实在惭愧，特别是我很惭愧，各位不至于惭愧。我自己作为一个党员，又是一个什么家，眼泪要朝肚子里流。总之一句话，我们不仅没有为工农兵服务，而是倒转来是工农兵在文史哲方面为我们服务了。我们应该向工农兵感谢，拜工农兵为老师，因为他们把主席思想学好了，用活了。
    我今天的话好象是表态，确实是表我的心态，说出了我心里想说的话。我现在是：要好好向工农兵学习，还不能谈怎么样为工农兵服务的问题。现在应该好好地向工农兵学习，拜工农兵为老师。我虽然已经七十几岁了，雄心壮志还有一点。就是说要滚一身泥巴，我愿意；要沾一身油污，我愿意；甚至于要染一身血迹，假使美帝国主义要来打我们的话，向美帝国主义分子投几个手榴弹，我也愿意。我的意思就是这样的，现在应该向工农兵好好地学习，假使有可能的话，再好好地为工农兵服务。（附图片）
