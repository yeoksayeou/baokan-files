    It doesn’t matter if you have thirty-six stratagems or seventy-two transformations, whether you go to heaven or into the sea, you cannot escape, you cannot slip away.
    National People's Congress Representative, Combat Hero Shu Jicheng

    We at the coastal defense front, after reading the materials published in the *Liberation Army Daily* titled “Deng Tuo’s ‘Yanshan Night Talks’ are Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Black Talk,” we were so filled with anger that we wanted to burn the "Three-Family Village" black shop to ashes! The anti-Party and anti-socialist elements are so rampant, how can we let them go! We soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, since we can beat the aerial bandits to a pulp, can also completely smash the frenzied attacks of a handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements.

    This gang of blackguards, taking advantage of the temporary difficulties our country experienced a few years ago, colluded with reactionary forces at home and abroad, raised a black flag, and stirred up a demonic wind, attempting to fire cold shots from behind and kill us. How insidious, how vicious! They dared to curse Chairman Mao’s great saying, “The East Wind prevails over the West Wind,” calling it “empty talk” and a “cliché.” They also blatantly shouted: “I advise friends who like to talk about grand empty talk to read more, think more, speak less, and when you need to speak, go and rest,” “Don’t say anything, don’t do anything.” Look, how arrogant! Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most living Marxism-Leninism, the highest instruction for all our army's work, and the guide for the actions of our revolutionary soldiers. Deng Tuo and his ilk dared to slander it, truly lawless! Deng Tuo and his ilk arrogantly want Mao Zedong Thought to "rest," and everything to follow their "guidance." If their conspiracy succeeds, it means that right-leaning opportunism, i.e., revisionism, will come to power, capitalist ideology will run rampant, and it will not be just a matter of us stepping down to "rest," but the entire country will change its color. Let me tell you, we soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought will never allow your conspiracy to succeed!

    The "Three-Family Village" black gang wants to prevent us from speaking revolutionary words, from speaking the words of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, only allowing them to speak revisionist words, to speak anti-Party and anti-socialist black talk; preventing us from doing things to defend Mao Zedong Thought and socialism, only allowing them to attack the Party and dig at the foundations of socialism. Now, when the people's giant hand has lifted their black curtain, they still vainly attempt to muddle through and not allow us to get to the bottom of things. This is a pipe dream! Chairman Mao said long ago: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all monsters and demons should be criticized, and they must never be allowed to run rampant." Your "Three-Family Village" black gang has already released poisonous weeds for several years and shot out hundreds of poisonous arrows. Now is the time for us to eradicate the roots! Whether you are a Three-Family Village or a Four-Family Village, whether you are a "master" or an "authority," we must expose you and thoroughly smash you! No matter what "retreating strategy" you play, whether you have thirty-six stratagems or seventy-two transformations, whether you go to heaven or into the sea, we must pursue you to the end. You absolutely cannot escape, you cannot slip away!

    是斩草除根的时候了
    不管你们是三十六计，还是七十二变，不管你们是上天还是入海，都是走不了，溜不掉的
    全国人民代表大会代表、战斗英雄　舒积成
    我们在海防前线，看了《解放军报》登载的《邓拓的〈燕山夜话〉是反党反社会主义的黑话》的材料，大家恨不得用满腔怒火把“三家村”黑店烧成灰烬！反党反社会主义分子这样猖狂，我们怎么能放过他们！我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，既然能把空中强盗揍个稀巴烂，也能够把一小撮反党反社会主义分子的猖狂进攻彻底粉碎。
    这伙黑帮，乘我国前几年暂时困难时期，配合国内外反动势力，打起黑旗，吹起妖风，妄想从背后打冷枪，把我们打死，多么阴险，多么恶毒！他胆敢咒骂毛主席提出的“东风压倒西风”这一伟大名言是“空话”，是“陈词滥调”。他还明目张胆地大喊：“我奉劝爱说伟大的空话的朋友，还是多读，多想，少说一些，遇到要说话的时候，就去休息”，“什么话都不要说，什么事情都不能做。”看，多么嚣张！毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是我们全军各项工作的最高指示，是我们革命战士行动的指南。邓拓之流竟敢大骂，真是无法无天！邓拓之流狂妄地要毛泽东思想“休息”，一切听从他们的“指导”。要是他们的阴谋得逞，那就是右倾机会主义即修正主义上台，资本主义思想泛滥，我们就不是下台“休息”的问题，而是整个国家就要改变颜色。告诉你们，我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士决不会允许你们的阴谋得逞！
    “三家村”黑帮妄想不准我们说革命的话，说马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想的话，只准他们说修正主义的话，说反党反社会主义的黑话；不准我们做保卫毛泽东思想、保卫社会主义的事，只准他们做攻击党，挖社会主义墙脚的事。现在，当人民的巨掌把他们的黑幕掀开的时候，他们还妄想蒙混过关，不许我们追根究底。这是白日作梦！毛主席早就说过：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”你们“三家村”黑帮已经放了几年的毒草，射出了几百支毒箭，现在，是我们斩草除根的时候了！不管你是三家村还是四家村，不管是什么“大师”还是什么“权威”，我们都要把你揭露出来，彻底捣毁！不管你耍什么“退兵之计”，不管你们是三十六计还是七十二变，不管你们是上天还是入海，我们都要穷追到底，你们是绝对走不了，溜不掉的！
