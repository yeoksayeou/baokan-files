    Xinhua News Agency, May 8th – The Chinese-African People's Friendship Association held a banquet tonight to receive the Guinean National Djoliba Dance Ensemble, headed by General Director Sissoko Amadou.

    Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi and his wife Zhang Qian attended the banquet.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke at the banquet. He extended a warm welcome to the Guinean artists on behalf of the State Council and congratulated them on the success of their performances in China. Last year, when Vice Premier Chen Yi visited Guinea, he saw the wonderful performance of the Djoliba Ballet in Conakry. He expressed his great pleasure at being able to gather with Guinean artists in Beijing today.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the programs performed by the Guinean artists vividly demonstrated the real situation of the Guinean people striving for freedom, building a happy life, and carrying out the anti-imperialist struggle. The Chinese people can understand your programs, which have aroused our resonance and universal praise.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi said that "Djoliba" is a river of peace, and the people on both sides of "Djoliba" are heroic people who have waged a heroic struggle and finally gained freedom. Your performance of the chorus "Djoliba" is a heroic ode to Africa.

    He continued, "The Devil of the Mountain Spring" is a very good dance. It tells the story of how the people in ancient times broke superstitions, killed the devil after a battle, and regained the water source, thus being saved. This is equivalent to telling people that only by overthrowing imperialism and colonialism can the world gain freedom and independence. This is the best dance with realistic educational significance.

      "Mother" is a program that shows the Guinean women made heroic sacrifices for the rights and honor of the motherland. She dedicated her first son to the motherland, and then unhesitatingly sent her second son to the front line to fight for the independence and freedom of the motherland. Guinea has such mothers, Africa has such mothers, China has such mothers, and Asia, Latin America, and other places have such mothers. Many people were very moved when they saw this program, and even shed tears. Imperialism does not like this dance, but we especially like this dance. We think this dance should be introduced to the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi said that one of the most outstanding programs performed by the Guinean artists is "Fighting Africa Sings Praises of Mao Zedong and His Great Cause." In this performance, the Guinean artists sang that Chairman Mao Zedong's works are "infinite power," that Chairman Mao's thought is "a sun that never sets, it illuminates the vast China and also illuminates the hearts of the fighting people all over the world," and that they want to "dedicate this song to the Black brothers" and the "White brothers" in Europe and the United States, "no matter where they go, wherever they go," "they must spread the voice of this truth." Vice Premier Chen Yi said that this program fully expressed the Guinean people's infinite love and respect for Chairman Mao Zedong and his great works. In this regard, Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the Chinese people, expressed his gratitude to the Guinean artists and people. He concluded by saying: We are willing to strengthen the militant friendship between the Chinese and Guinean people and fight together to the end to overthrow imperialism and colonialism.

    Guinean Ambassador to China, Camara Sekou and his wife were also invited to the banquet. The Ambassador spoke at the banquet on behalf of all members of the ballet troupe. He said that the warm welcome the Guinean ballet troupe received in China is a sign of the Chinese people's friendship to the Guinean people. Your welcome encourages them to continue to work hard and use art to fully reflect the fighting spirit of the Guinean people.

    The Ambassador said that the help of the Chinese artists to the Guinean dance troupe and the welcome of the Chinese people to the dance, not only reflects the support of the Chinese people to the Guinean people, but also reflects their support to all people who oppose imperialism and strive for revolution. He said: "We are qualified to say that the Chinese people's support for all revolutionary people, for all people who are opposing imperialism, colonialism, and neo-colonialism, is not verbal, but consistent and effective."

    Ambassador Sekou expressed that in order to strengthen our revolutionary friendship in the anti-imperialist struggle, for the victory of the world revolution, and to eliminate imperialism and neo-colonialism in all parts of the world, the Guinean people will always stand with the Chinese people.

    Vice President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association Zhang Tiesheng also spoke at the banquet.

    Present at the banquet were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, Deputy Directors of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Song Yiping and Yang Chun, Vice Minister of Culture Xu Pingyu, and relevant persons from the capital, including Zhou Weizhi, Song Changhua, Li Yuanqing, Wen Chi, Ding Bo, and Sheng Jie.

    The banquet was filled with the close militant friendship between the Chinese and Guinean people from beginning to end. During the banquet, artists from China and Guinea performed wonderful songs, dances, and music. (Picture attached)

    陈副总理在中非友协招待几舞蹈团宴会上讲话
    赞扬几内亚艺术家演出了很好的反帝歌舞
    塞古大使表示在反帝斗争中几内亚人民将永远同中国人民站在一起
    新华社八日讯　中非人民友好协会今晚举行宴会，招待以总团长西索柯·阿马杜为首的几内亚国立佐利巴舞蹈团。
    国务院副总理陈毅和夫人张茜出席了宴会。
    陈毅副总理在宴会上讲了话。他代表国务院向几内亚艺术家们表示热烈欢迎，祝贺他们在中国访问演出的成功。去年，陈毅副总理访问几内亚时，在科纳克里看到过佐利巴芭蕾舞团的精彩表演，今天又在北京和几内亚的艺术家们欢聚一堂，他表示非常高兴。
    陈毅副总理说，几内亚艺术家们演出的节目，很好地表现了几内亚人民争取自由、正在建设幸福生活和正在进行反帝斗争的真实情况。你们的节目中国人民都能理解，引起了我们的共鸣和普遍称赞。
    陈毅副总理说，“佐利巴”是一条和平的河流，“佐利巴”两岸的人民是英雄的人民，他们进行了英勇的斗争，终于获得了自由。你们表演的大合唱“佐利巴”是一曲非洲的英雄颂歌。
    他接着说，“山泉魔鬼”这个舞蹈很好，它介绍了古时人民破除迷信，经过战斗杀死魔鬼，夺回水源因而得救的故事。这等于告诉人们现在的世界只有打倒帝国主义和殖民主义，才能获得自由和独立。这是富有现实教育意义的最好的舞蹈。
      “母亲”这个节目，表现了几内亚的妇女，为了祖国的权利和荣誉，做出了英勇的牺牲。她为祖国献出了第一个儿子，接着又毫不犹豫地把第二个儿子送上前线，为祖国的独立、自由而战。几内亚有这样的母亲，非洲有这样的母亲，中国有这样的母亲，亚洲、拉丁美洲及其他地方都有这样的母亲。很多人看了这个节目，很感动，甚至流下了眼泪。帝国主义不喜欢这个舞蹈，我们特别喜欢这个舞蹈，我们认为应该向亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民介绍这个舞蹈。
    陈毅副总理说，几内亚艺术家表演的最优秀的节目之一是《战斗的非洲歌颂毛泽东和他伟大的事业》。几内亚艺术家们在这个演唱中歌颂毛泽东主席的著作是“无穷的力量”，歌颂毛主席的思想是“永远不落的太阳，它照亮了辽阔的中国，也把全世界战斗的人民心儿照亮”，并且要“把这歌声献给黑人兄弟”和欧美的“白人兄弟”，“不管走到哪里，奔向何方”，“都要把这真理的声音传播”。陈毅副总理说，这个节目充分表达了几内亚人民对毛泽东主席和他的伟大著作的无比热爱和尊敬。对此，陈毅副总理代表中国人民向几内亚艺术家和人民表示感谢。他最后说：我们愿意为加强中几两国人民之间的战斗友谊，为打倒帝国主义和殖民主义而共同奋斗到底。
    几内亚驻中国大使卡马拉·塞古和夫人也应邀出席了宴会。大使代表芭蕾舞团的全体成员在宴会上讲了话。他说，几内亚芭蕾舞团在中国受到的热烈欢迎，是中国人民对几内亚人民友好的表示，你们的欢迎，鼓励他们继续努力，用艺术来充分反映几内亚人民的战斗精神。
    大使说，中国艺术家们对几内亚舞蹈团的帮助和中国人民对舞蹈的欢迎，不但反映了中国人民对几内亚人民的支持，也反映了他们对一切反对帝国主义和争取革命的人民的支持。他说：“我们有资格说，中国人民对一切革命人民，对一切正在反对帝国主义、殖民主义和新殖民主义的人民的支持，不是口头上的，而是一贯的，有效的。”
    塞古大使表示，为了加强我们反帝斗争中的革命友谊，为了世界革命的胜利，为了在世界一切地方消除帝国主义和新殖民主义，几内亚人民将永远同中国人民站在一起。
    中非人民友好协会副会长张铁生也在宴会上讲了话。
    出席宴会的有外交部副部长姬鹏飞、对外文委副主任宋一平、杨纯，文化部副部长徐平羽，以及首都有关方面人士周巍峙、宋常华、李元庆、文迟、丁波、盛婕等。
    宴会自始至终洋溢着中几两国人民亲密的战斗友谊。席间中几两国艺术家表演了歌舞和音乐等精采节目。（附图片）
