    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 18th -- U.S. President Johnson and Secretary of State Rusk reiterated on the 17th that the U.S. policy of aggression against Vietnam will not change due to the turmoil in the South Vietnamese political situation, and that the U.S. will carry the war of aggression against Vietnam to the end.

    Johnson said at a Democratic gathering in Chicago that the United States "will not withdraw" from South Vietnam, even though "the road ahead is difficult." He attacked those in the United States who criticized his aggressive Vietnam adventure policy as "some nervous people," and clamored that the U.S. government is "determined" to "resist" so-called "aggression," that the U.S. must "fulfill its obligations in South Vietnam," and that "the road to peace is not the road of concession and retreat."

    Rusk also reiterated at a press conference on the same day that the United States would continue to implement its "see it through" policy in South Vietnam. Referring to the recent infighting and clashes within the South Vietnamese puppet clique, Rusk made it clear that the United States wanted to support its lackey Nguyen Cao Ky in suppressing dissidents, but was also worried that this would cause greater chaos in South Vietnam, making it even more difficult for the United States to control. He said, "Those in power believe that it is important for the government (i.e., the Saigon puppet regime) to re-establish its authority in Da Nang." However, he also expressed concern that this would lead to "military clashes" between the puppet cliques. Rusk expressed "happiness" that the puppet cliques are now in "a kind of stalemate," and pointed out that the United States hopes "to resolve" the differences between the puppet cliques "without (armed) conflict." The United States demanded that various elements of the puppet clique implement "reconciliation," promote the American-fabricated "constitutional process," and submit more obediently to American manipulation. He put pressure on these puppet cliques, saying that Washington has "a sense of impatience" with the situation in South Vietnam. When asked whether U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam Lodge's return home for "consultations" would cause any changes in U.S. policy or actions in Vietnam, Rusk replied "no." He said that Lodge's week-long stay in the country allowed the U.S. government to complete a very long agenda, and that most of the time was spent discussing "how to most effectively implement the conclusions of the Honolulu Conference."

    At the Honolulu Conference held by the United States and the Nguyen Cao Ky group in February of this year, the U.S. policy of aggression against Vietnam was comprehensively reviewed, and a two-pronged approach of strengthening military offensives and carrying out social "reforms" was determined. At this conference, the United States also made the decision to increase the U.S. troops in Vietnam to 400,000 this year.

    Rusk also stated that the United States attempts to promote a policy of war blackmail by intensifying the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    约翰逊腊斯克叫嚷要在南越“干到底”
    担心傀儡内讧难以收拾，要求双方“和解”听任美国摆布
    新华社十八日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统约翰逊和国务卿腊斯克十七日重申，美国侵略越南的政策决不会因为南越政局的动荡而有所改变，美国要把侵越战争进行到底。
    约翰逊在芝加哥的一次民主党人集会上说，美国“不会撤出”南越，尽管“前面的道路是艰难的”。他攻击美国国内那些批评他的侵越冒险政策的人是“一些神经质的人”，并且叫嚷说，美国政府“决心”要“抵抗”所谓“侵略”，美国要“遵守它在南越承担的义务”，“走向和平的道路不是让步和退却的道路”。
    腊斯克在同一天的记者招待会上也重申了美国要在南越继续执行“干到底”的政策。谈到南越傀儡集团最近发生的内讧和火并时，腊斯克表明，美国既要支持它的走狗阮高其讨伐异己，又担心这会在南越引起更大的混乱，使美国越发难以收拾。他说，“那些执政者们认为，政府（即西贡傀儡政权）在岘港使它的命令重新得到执行是重要的。”但是，他又表示担心这会使各傀儡集团之间“以武力相混扰”。腊斯克对各傀儡集团现在处于“某种平局状态”表示“高兴”，并且指出，美国希望“不至于发生（武装）冲突就能解决”各傀儡集团间的分歧。美国要求傀儡集团的各种分子实行“和解”，推进美国炮制的“制宪过程”，更加服贴地听任美国摆布。他对这些傀儡集团施加压力说，华盛顿对南越局势“存在着不耐烦的情绪”。腊斯克在回答有关美国驻南越“大使”洛奇回国“磋商”一事是否会使美国侵越政策或行动发生任何改变时，腊斯克回答说“不”。他说，洛奇在国内的一周逗留使美国政府把一个非常长的议程审议完毕，大部分时间是花在讨论“如何最有效地贯彻檀香山会议的结论上”。
    在今年二月美国同阮高其集团举行的檀香山会议上，全面地审查了美国的侵越政策，确定了加强军事进攻和进行社会“改革”双管齐下的侵越方针。美国在这次会议上还作出了在今年内把侵越美军增加到四十万的决定。
    腊斯克还表示，美国企图以加强对越南民主共和国的轰炸来推行战争讹诈政策。
