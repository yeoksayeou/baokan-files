    Albanian Democratic Front National Committee Issues Letter to Voters
    Calling for Promoting Revolutionary Spirit to Greet People's Assembly Election
    Comrade Hoxha Presides Over Meeting and Delivers Important Speech
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, May 22nd—The meeting of the National Committee of the Albanian Democratic Front concluded in Tirana on the 21st.
    The meeting was presided over by Comrade Enver Hoxha, Chairman of the National Committee of the Albanian Democratic Front. The meeting discussed the tasks facing the Democratic Front organizations at all levels in the current People's Assembly election campaign. The meeting heard and discussed the report by Comrade Paçrami, Secretary-General of the National Committee of the Democratic Front, on this issue, and unanimously agreed to hold elections for a new People's Assembly.
    Comrade Hoxha delivered an important speech at the meeting.
    The meeting adopted the Letter to All Voters of the National Committee of the Albanian Democratic Front. The letter to voters stated that the upcoming election of the People's Assembly on July 10th this year is a major political event of national significance, a manifestation of socialist democracy, and a demonstration of the people being the masters of their own affairs.
    The letter to voters pointed out that the people of our country are welcoming the election of the People's Assembly in the atmosphere of high patriotism and enthusiasm aroused by the appeal of the Albanian Labor Party and the government last October and the open letter from the Party Central Committee to the people of the country this March. The ideas of these two important documents and the specific measures taken on this basis are an inspiring source for winning new victories. The people of the country, both men and women, old and young, unanimously agree with these historical documents and the measures taken by the Party and the government, bringing the revolutionary enthusiasm of our people to an unprecedented stage.
    The letter to voters, in talking about the great victories achieved by the people's government in the past twenty-two years, pointed out that during the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), that is, during the Fifth People's Assembly, thanks to the wise leadership of the Party and the selfless labor of the working people, great difficulties and obstacles were overcome, and important victories were achieved. On the basis of the improvement of social production, the people's cultural level has been improved, and the people's welfare has been improved. Along with economic and social reforms, a profound cultural and ideological revolution is also underway. One of the great victories of our socialist revolution is the emergence and training of new people with a new worldview and noble moral qualities.
    The letter to voters put forward the current great combat tasks to the workers, peasants, intellectuals, women, youth, and the army of the country, praised their highly revolutionary spirit under the inspiration of the appeal of the Party and the government and the open letter of the Party Central Committee, and the creative labor for the victorious realization of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, and called on them to make persistent efforts on all fronts and strive for greater victories.
    The letter to voters, in talking about the current international situation and Albania's foreign policy, warmly praised the great friendship and combat solidarity between the Albanian and Chinese people. It said that the firm and principled foreign policy of the Albanian Labor Party and the government has strengthened the position of the People's Republic of Albania and enhanced its international prestige, and has won more sympathy from friendly countries, the people of all countries in the world, and freedom-loving forces. Friendly cooperation and fraternal relations with brotherly countries standing on the Marxist-Leninist position and all countries pursuing a policy of peace, friendship, and sincere cooperation will always be the basis of this policy. The great friendship and iron-like unity link the Albanian people and the Albanian Labor Party with the great Chinese people and the Communist Party of China. This friendship and unity, which is completely consistent in thought and action, this friendship and unity, which is produced and tempered in the common struggle against common enemies and in the struggle to realize common ideals, is a particularly great force that inspires and mobilizes the people of our two countries to fight enthusiastically for the common cause. The recent visit of the Albanian Party and government delegation to China and the Sino-Albanian Joint Statement are great historical events, which will further strengthen our friendship and combat solidarity.
    The letter to voters pointed out that our people's government is a weapon in the hands of the working people. The letter to voters called on all voters to actively and enthusiastically participate in the People's Assembly election on July 10th, and to elect loyal and revolutionary people, hardworking workers, peasants, people's intellectuals, soldiers, and those who live and work with the people and make valuable contributions to collective welfare with their work, to the highest organ of state power—the People's Assembly. The letter to voters finally called on all voters to vote for the candidates proposed by the Democratic Front.

    阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线全国委员会发表告选民书
    号召发扬革命精神迎接人民议会选举
    霍查同志主持会议并作了重要发言
    新华社地拉那二十二日电　阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线全国委员会会议二十一日在地拉那闭幕。
    这次会议由阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线全国委员会主席恩维尔·霍查同志主持。会议讨论了民主阵线各级组织在当前人民议会选举运动中所面临的任务。会议听取和讨论了民主阵线全国委员会秘书长帕奇拉米就这个问题所作的报告，并表示一致同意进行新的人民议会的选举。
    霍查同志在会上作了重要发言。
    会议通过了阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线全国委员会告全体选民书。告选民书说，即将在今年七月十日举行的人民议会选举是具有全国意义的重大政治事件，是社会主义民主的表现，是人民当家作主的表现。
    告选民书指出，我国人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府去年十月的呼吁书以及党中央今年三月致全国人民的公开信所激起的高度爱国主义气氛和热情中，来迎接人民议会的选举。呼吁书和公开信这两个重要文件的思想以及在此基础上所采取的具体措施，是争取新的胜利的令人鼓舞的源泉。全国男女老幼一致同意这两个历史性文件以及党和政府所采取的措施，使我国人民的革命热情提高到一个空前未有的阶段。
    告选民书在谈到人民政权二十二年来所取得的伟大胜利时指出，在第三个五年计划（一九六一——一九六五年）期间，也就是在第五届人民议会期间，由于党的英明领导和劳动人民群众的忘我劳动，克服了巨大的困难和障碍，取得了重要的胜利。在社会生产提高的基础上，人民的文化水平有所提高，生活福利得到改善。与经济和社会改革进行的同时，也进行了一场深刻的文化和思想革命。我们社会主义革命的巨大胜利之一是出现了和锻炼了具有新的世界观和高尚道德品质的新人。
    告选民书向全国工人、农民、知识分子、妇女、青年和军队提出了当前的伟大战斗任务，赞扬他们在党和政府的呼吁书以及党中央公开信的鼓舞下，发扬高度的革命精神，为胜利实现第四个五年计划而进行的创造性劳动，并号召他们在各个战线上再接再厉，争取更大的胜利。
    告选民书在谈到当前的国际形势和阿尔巴尼亚的对外政策时，热烈赞扬阿尔巴尼亚和中国人民的伟大友谊和战斗团结。它说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府的坚定和原则性的对外政策加强了阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的地位，并且提高了它的国际威望，更加赢得了友好国家、全世界各国人民和爱好自由力量的同情。同站在马克思列宁主义立场上的兄弟国家和所有奉行和平、友好和真诚合作政策的国家的友好合作和兄弟般联系，永远是这一政策的基础。伟大的友谊和钢铁般的团结把阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党同伟大的中国人民和中国共产党联系起来。这种在思想和行动上完全一致的友谊和团结、这种在反对共同敌人、在争取实现共同理想的共同斗争中产生和锤炼出来的友谊和团结，是鼓舞和动员我们两国人民充满热情地去为共同事业而斗争的特别巨大的力量。阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团最近访问中国和阿中联合声明，是伟大的历史性事件，它将进一步加强我们的友谊和战斗团结。
    告选民书指出，我们的人民政权是掌握在劳动人民群众手中的武器。告选民书号召全体选民积极踊跃参加七月十日的人民议会选举，把忠心耿耿的和革命的人，把勤劳的工人、农民、人民知识分子、士兵以及同人民一起生活和劳动、以自己的工作对集体福利作出宝贵贡献的人选到国家政权的最高机关——人民议会中去。告选民书最后号召全体选民投票选举民主阵线提出的候选人。
