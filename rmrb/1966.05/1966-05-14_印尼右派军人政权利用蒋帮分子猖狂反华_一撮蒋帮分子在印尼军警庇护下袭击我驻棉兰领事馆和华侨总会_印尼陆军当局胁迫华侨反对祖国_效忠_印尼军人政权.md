    Xinhua News Agency, 13th Dispatch from Jakarta: The Indonesian right-wing military regime, on May 7th, once again openly instigated Chiang gang special agents to coerce Overseas Chinese to hold anti-China rallies and parades in Medan, and once again rampantly attacked the Chinese Consulate in Medan and the Medan Overseas Chinese General Association.
    This incident shows that the Indonesian government is systematically using Chiang gang special agents as tools to wantonly oppose China throughout the country.
    On the morning of May 7th, with the support of the Inter-Regional Command of the Sumatra Defense Area and the Second Military Region authorities, Chiang gang special agents in Medan, North Sumatra, Zeng Shaofan, who had long worked at the U.S. Consulate in Medan, and other Chiang gang elements, convened an anti-China rally at the local Maimun Square called the "North Sumatra Overseas Chinese Loyalty to Pancasila Revolution Inspection Conference." The venue was heavily guarded by military police, with a guard every twenty steps. Very few people participated.
    After this "Inspection" conference, the participants, under the protection of military police, held an anti-China parade. They were "inspected" in front of the Inter-Regional Command of the Sumatra Defense Area by Brigadier General Moski, the Chief of Staff and representative of the Inter-Regional Commander. In his "instructional speech," Moski viciously slandered China as "Oriental imperialism," slandered the Overseas Chinese as "political and economic weapons of imperialism," and "the fifth column in Indonesia," and shouted: "The existence of the fifth column will never be tolerated," "All Overseas Chinese should choose between the Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China, and oppose those who sit on the fence."
    Zeng Shaofan issued a five-point statement in accordance with the wishes of the Indonesian authorities, stating that he "wants to be loyal to the Indonesian government and armed forces," "resolutely eliminate the enemies of the Pancasila Revolution, including the People's Republic of China and its pawns," and requested "instructions from the Indonesian government and armed forces."
    After the parade, more than twenty Chiang gang elements, led by Zeng Shaofan and another Chiang gang special agent named Ruan Changlong, dressed in an Indonesian Civil Defense uniform, attacked the Chinese Consulate in Medan. After breaking into the consulate, they raised the Indonesian flag on the flagpole, sang the Indonesian national anthem, and shouted reactionary slogans such as "Crush the People's Republic of China," "Expel the Chinese," "Long Live Uncle Suharto," and "Long Live the Indonesian Armed Forces." They also plastered anti-China slogans on the windows of the consulate building.
    During the attack on the Chinese Consulate by this group of Chiang gang elements, the police near the consulate not only did not stop them, but repeatedly cheered them on.
    On the same day, the Chiang gang elements, in coordination with armed military police in an armored vehicle, also attacked the Medan Overseas Chinese General Association. They burned the Chinese flag and the portrait of Chairman Liu Shaoqi hanging inside the building, and looted a large number of documents. The Garrison Command also announced the formal "takeover" of the Overseas Chinese General Association afterwards.
    This anti-China atrocity was entirely carefully planned by the Indonesian right-wing authorities. Before the anti-China rally, the newspaper sponsored by the Medan Armed Forces widely published a "Notice" threatening Overseas Chinese to participate, saying that the rally was convened "to thoroughly oppose the CCP's position and strive for a clean identity, in order to comply with government security measures." The notice stipulated that participants "must complete registration procedures at the offices of village chiefs, first obtaining a participation certificate, which will then serve as an identification card."
    A few days before the anti-China rally, the Indonesian right-wing authorities also instigated Chiang gang special agents in the Medan area to send people to the areas where Overseas Chinese were concentrated, colluding with village chiefs to threaten the Overseas Chinese, saying: "Participating in the inspection conference will be protected," and those who do not participate "will be crushed." They also openly claimed: "This is what the Taiwan government told the Indonesian government to do."
    The Chiang gang special agents who came forward to preside over this anti-China rally also held a press conference in advance in the company of Major Subardi, the head of the Second Military Region Information Office. According to the wishes of the Indonesian right-wing forces, they openly carried out vicious slanders against China. The Indonesian right-wing authorities widely printed and distributed these reactionary remarks by Chiang gang special agents. The Chinese-language daily newspaper published by the Indonesian Armed Forces even brazenly printed an anti-China slogan in bold on May 4th: "Loyalty Grand Inspection is a manifestation of distinguishing between 'enemy' and 'friend,' unite friends, and defeat the enemy—the CCP."

    一撮蒋帮分子在印尼军警庇护下袭击我驻棉兰领事馆和华侨总会
    印尼陆军当局胁迫华侨反对祖国“效忠”印尼军人政权
    新华社十三日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权五月七日又公然唆使蒋帮特务分子，胁迫华侨在棉兰举行反华集会和游行，并再一次猖狂地袭击了中国驻棉兰领事馆和棉兰华侨总会。
    这次事件表明：印度尼西亚政府正在全国各地有计划地利用蒋帮特务分子作为它放肆地反华的工具。
    七日上午，在苏门答腊防御区际司令部和第二军区当局的支持下，北苏门答腊棉兰的蒋帮特务分子、长期在美国驻棉兰领事馆工作的曾少藩以及其他蒋帮分子，在当地铭登广场召集了一次名叫什么“北苏门答腊反中共华侨效忠潘查希拉（编者按：印度尼西亚的建国五项原则）革命检阅大会”的反华集会。会场上军警密布，二十步一岗。参加的人寥寥无几。
    在这个“检阅”大会举行以后，参加集会的人，在军警的护卫下，举行了反华游行。他们在苏门答腊防御区际司令部门前接受了防御区际司令的代表、参谋长莫斯基达准将的“检阅”。莫斯基达在致“训词”中，恶毒地诬蔑中国是“东方帝国主义”，诬蔑华侨是“政治和经济帝国主义的武器”、“在印度尼西亚的第五纵队”，并且叫喊：“决不容忍第五纵队的存在”，“所有华侨，应当在印度尼西亚共和国和中华人民共和国两者之间选择其一，反对骑墙分子。”
    曾少藩按照印度尼西亚当局的意旨发表了五点声明，表示“要忠于印度尼西亚政府和武装部队”，“坚决歼灭潘查希拉革命的敌人包括中华人民共和国及其走卒”，并且请求“印度尼西亚政府和武装部队指示”。
    在游行以后，二十多名蒋帮分子在曾少藩和另一名身穿印度尼西亚民防队制服的蒋帮特务分子阮昌隆的带领下，袭击了中国驻棉兰领事馆。他们闯进领事馆以后，在旗杆上升起了印度尼西亚国旗，唱印度尼西亚国歌，并高声喊叫“粉碎中华人民共和国”，“驱逐中国侨民”，“苏哈托伯伯万岁”、“印度尼西亚武装部队万岁”等反动口号。他们还在领事馆建筑物的玻璃窗上贴满了反华标语。
    在这批蒋帮分子袭击中国领事馆的过程中，在领事馆附近的警察不但不加阻止，反而一再为这批蒋帮分子助威。
    这天，蒋帮分子还在装满一辆装甲车的武装军警的配合下，袭击了棉兰华侨总会。他们焚烧了建筑物内悬挂的中国国旗和刘少奇主席的画象，并且劫走了大批文件。驻军司令部还在事后宣布正式“接管”华侨总会。
    这次反华暴行，完全是由印度尼西亚右派当局精心策划的。在这次反华集会举行以前，棉兰武装部队主办的报纸曾经广泛刊登“通告”，威胁华侨必须参加，说什么这次集会是“为了彻底反对中共立场，争取清白身份，以符合政府保安措施”而召开的。通告上规定参加的人“在各村长办公处履行登记手续，先给参加证，以后即作为身份证”。
    在反华集会举行前几天，印度尼西亚右派当局还唆使棉兰地区的蒋帮特务分子分头派人到华侨集中的地区，串通村长威胁华侨说：“参加检阅大会可以受到保护”，不参加的“将被粉碎”。他们还公开扬言：“这是台湾政府叫印度尼西亚政府这样做的”。
    出面主持这次反华集会的蒋帮特务分子，还在第二军区新闻处长苏巴蒂少校的陪同下，事先举行了记者招待会。按照印度尼西亚右派势力的意旨，公然对中国进行恶毒的诽谤。印度尼西亚右派当局把蒋帮特务分子的这些反动言论广为印发。印度尼西亚武装部队出版的中文日报还在五月四日公然用黑体大字刊登一条煽动反华的标语：“效忠大检阅是分清‘敌’和‘友’的表现，团结友人，击溃敌人——中共”。
