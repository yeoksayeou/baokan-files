    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 2nd. According to Pathet Lao Radio: Phoumi Vongvichit, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, Minister of Information, Propaganda and Tourism of the Lao National Union Government, and Member of the Central Committee for the Implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Laos, sent an urgent telegram to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on April 28, strongly condemning US imperialism's use of B-52 aircraft to bomb Lao liberated areas.

    The telegram said that the US aggressors had recently dispatched B-52 strategic aircraft many times, taking off from bases in the Pacific, to carry out unprecedented and fierce air raids on the liberated areas of Khammouane Province, Savannakhet Province and Saravane Province in Laos, with the aim of massacring the Lao people on a large scale. This is a new and extremely dangerous escalation. These criminal actions prove that the US imperialists have brazenly embarked on the road of escalating and expanding their war of aggression against Laos, making the already seriously deteriorating situation in Laos even more dangerous, and threatening the security of Indochina and Southeast Asia as never before.

    The telegram demanded that US imperialism immediately stop using B-52 bombers to carry out large-scale massacres of the Lao people, and stop all bombing and strafing of the Lao liberated areas. The telegram also requested the two chairmen to fulfill the obligations stipulated for them by the 1962 Geneva Agreements on Laos, severely condemn this extremely dangerous war action by the United States, urge the United States to stop using B-52 strategic aircraft and other types of aircraft to massacre the Lao people without delay, and demand that the United States abide by and correctly implement the 1962 Geneva Agreements on Laos.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 2nd. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 2nd, strongly condemning the crime of the United States in continuously using B-52 strategic bombers to bomb the liberated areas of Laos.

    The statement pointed out that after the US imperialists stepped up various military aggression activities against the Lao liberated areas, they dispatched B-52 strategic bombers to wantonly bomb many areas of Laos, which is obviously an extremely serious new escalation in the US imperialists' plan to strengthen and expand the criminal war of aggression against Laos.

    The statement pointed out that this extremely barbarous new criminal action by US imperialism is an extremely arrogant provocation against the people of Laos, the people of Indochina and the people of the world.

    The statement announced that the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully support the position put forward in the statement of the Lao Patriotic Front on April 28 this year. The statement pointed out that the US government must bear full responsibility for all the consequences caused thereby.

    The statement said that all conspiracies of US imperialism to strengthen and expand its interference and aggression against Laos will surely be defeated. The just struggle of the Lao people will surely be victorious.

    新华社康开二日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会总书记，老挝民族团结政府新闻、宣传和游览大臣、老挝监察执行日内瓦协议中央委员会委员富米·冯维希四月二十八日打紧急电报给日内瓦会议的两主席，强烈谴责美帝国主义使用B—52型飞机轰炸老挝解放区。
    电报说，美国侵略者最近多次派遣B—52型战略飞机，从太平洋基地起飞，对老挝甘蒙省、沙湾拿吉省和沙拉湾省各解放区进行目的在于大批屠杀老挝人民的空前猛烈的空袭。这是一种新的极端危险的逐步升级。这些罪恶行动证明美帝国主义者悍然走上了加剧和扩大他们侵略老挝的战争的道路，使已经严重恶化的老挝局势更加危险，使印度支那和东南亚的安全受到空前的威胁。
    电报要求美帝国主义立即停止使用B—52型轰炸机对老挝人民进行大规模屠杀，停止对老挝解放区的一切轰炸和扫射。电报还要求两主席履行一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议给他们规定的义务，严厉谴责美国这种极其危险的战争行动，促使美国毫不迟延地停止使用B—52型战略飞机和其他各式飞机屠杀老挝人民，并要求美国遵守和正确执行一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议。
    新华社河内二日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人二日发表声明，强烈谴责美国接连使用B—52型战略轰炸机轰炸老挝解放区的罪行。
    声明指出，美帝国主义在加紧对老挝解放区进行各种军事侵略活动以后，又派遣B—52型战略轰炸机对老挝的许多地区滥肆轰炸，显然是美帝国主义在加强和扩大侵略老挝的罪恶战争计划中的一个极其严重的新升级。
    声明指出，美帝国主义的这种极其野蛮的新的罪恶行动，是对老挝人民、印度支那人民和全世界人民的极其蛮横的挑衅。
    声明宣布，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府完全支持老挝爱国战线党今年四月二十八日的声明中所提出的立场。声明指出，美国政府必须对由此而造成的一切后果承担全部责任。
    声明说，美帝国主义加强和扩大对老挝的干涉和侵略的一切阴谋必将遭到失败。老挝人民的正义斗争必将胜利。
