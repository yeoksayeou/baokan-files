    "Qianxian" and "Beijing Daily" Must Make a Thorough Confession
    Model workers, peasants, and soldiers of Sichuan Province pointed out that the reactionary gang of the "Three-Family Village" dared to use "Qianxian" and "Beijing Daily" as tools in our capital, next to Chairman Mao, directing their spearhead at the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The danger is extremely serious. We must heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, thoroughly uncover the inside story of this black den, and no matter how big their backers are, we must thoroughly destroy it.
    Model workers, peasants, and soldiers of Sichuan Province held a symposium to expose the political conspiracy of the "Three-Family Village" black den. They sternly pointed out that the inside story of this big black den must be thoroughly uncovered, and in particular, "Qianxian" and "Beijing Daily," which were used as their tools, must honestly and thoroughly confess all their conspiracies and plots.
    Participants in the symposium included: Yuan Zhixian, National People's Congress representative and industrial labor model of Sichuan Province; Zhang Sizhou, National People's Congress representative and agricultural labor model of Sichuan Province; and Huang Can, political instructor of the Yang Lian'di Company of a certain PLA unit.
    The symposium unanimously pointed out that the "Three-Family Village" black den, after careful planning, engaged in anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities purposefully, plannedly, and organizationally. The evil deeds committed by this black den once stirred up a dark cloud in China's political climate. Yuan Zhixian pointed out: This extremely sharp and complex class struggle is very serious in nature. Because Deng Tuo, this handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist political careerists, wearing the red cloak of Communist Party members, wielding a pen that kills without drawing blood, used "Qianxian," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News," etc., as their tools to oppose the Party and socialism, echoing the anti-China chorus of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries, viciously and madly attacking the Party, the people, and socialism, attempting to restore capitalism. He said: We know that fortresses are most easily breached from within. If this small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements are not thoroughly eliminated, if their conspiracy succeeds, then our country will quickly change its color, and our people will suffer extreme disasters! Didn't the Soviet modern revisionists use sharp poisonous arrows to attack Marxism-Leninism madly, and use colorful sugar-coated bullets to carry out "peaceful evolution," changing the color of the Soviet Union without firing a single shot or using a single knife? Zhang Sizhou said: Our struggle with the reactionary elements of the "Three-Family Village" is a very serious life-and-death class struggle. This group of reactionary elements dared to point the spearhead directly at the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao in our capital, next to Chairman Mao. The disaster is extremely dangerous, and it cannot but be shocking! We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, fight to the end, and thoroughly dig out all the evil roots in this black den!
    Comrades participating in the symposium said: Chairman Mao teaches us that class struggle is long-term, tortuous, and sometimes even very fierce. The small handful of reactionary elements in the "Three-Family Village" attacked the Party and socialism, adopting extremely sinister and vicious methods, and playing many tricks, truly racking their brains. However, the devil is one foot tall, but the truth is ten feet tall. We must also use our brains, dare to think, dare to write, dare to make revolution, and in the sharp and complex class struggle, firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, this magic mirror, and expose all monsters and demons in their true colors.
    Comrade Zhang Sizhou pointed out: "Qianxian" and "Beijing Daily" have big problems and must be thoroughly clarified. Everyone questioned "Qianxian" and "Beijing Daily": What role are you playing in the great socialist revolution? First, you staged a trick, with Deng Tuo using a pseudonym to protect Wu Han. When Wu Han could not be protected, Deng Tuo's true colors were exposed, and you used the method of fake criticism and true protection to protect Deng Tuo. You chase one, you admit one. You hope to make an issue of these three people, but that won't work! You say that you are not implementing proletarian command, so what are you commanding? Everyone pointed out that what you are protecting is not just Deng Tuo, but protecting positions, protecting strength, protecting bosses, and preparing for a comeback. There is a big conspiracy in this. Not only were you their tools when the "Three-Family Village" black den madly attacked the Party, but you are still their position for attacking the Party in the Great Cultural Revolution. You dared to throw out such blatant "codewords" in the tide of the Great Revolution! This proves that you know the inside story of this black den and participated in the conspiracy of the black den. You cannot deny this point.
    Everyone unanimously pointed out that "Qianxian" and "Beijing Daily" must honestly confess the inside story and all the conspiracies and tricks of the "Three-Family Village" black den in detail. Comrade Huang Can pointed out that we must of course eliminate all the poisonous weeds released by the "Three-Family Village" black den one by one, but if we do not investigate the inside story and dig deep into the old roots, then we will be fooled by them. Beijing is the location of our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. If we don't cut the weeds and eliminate the roots and let them leave a hidden danger waiting for a comeback, it would be too dangerous.
    Everyone unanimously expressed in their speeches that they would fight to the end with these monsters and demons. Yuan Zhixian said: "We workers suffered deeply in the old society. We know best what is sweet, what is bitter, what is good, and what is bad. The Party and Chairman Mao liberated us. The Party and Chairman Mao are our lives. Without the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we cannot survive. I came to participate in the symposium with illness. As long as I have a breath, I will fight on and never let Deng Tuo and other small handful of reactionary elements usurp the leadership of the Party and realize capitalist restoration." Comrade Huang Can said: "We are revolutionary soldiers taught by Chairman Mao, tools of the proletarian dictatorship. We dare to fight, dare to win, and dare to draw blood. No matter if it is Three-Family Village, Four-Family Village, or several family village, no matter how big their backers are, no matter how big their background is, we will completely, cleanly, and thoroughly destroy it."
    Comrades participating in the symposium all said that if anyone wants to change the color of China, then let them prepare their coffins! We are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and have mastered hammers, sickles, and guns. We can defeat all black gangs and eliminate all monsters and demons.

    《前线》《北京日报》必须彻底交代
    四川省工农兵模范人物指出，“三家村”的一伙反动黑帮，胆敢在我们的首都，在毛主席身旁，把《前线》、《北京日报》作为工具，将矛头指向党中央和毛主席，祸患极其危险。我们必须百倍提高警惕，彻底揭开这家黑店的内幕，不管有多大的靠山，都要彻底捣毁它
    四川省工农兵模范人物举行座谈会，揭露“三家村”大黑店的政治阴谋。他们严厉指出，必须彻底揭开这家大黑店的内幕，特别是要作为他们的工具的《前线》、《北京日报》老老实实地彻底交代他们的一切阴谋策划。
    参加座谈会的有：全国人民代表大会代表、四川省工业劳动模范袁志先，全国人民代表大会代表、四川省农业劳动模范张泗洲，解放军某部杨连第连指导员黄灿等。
    座谈会一致指出：“三家村”这家大黑店，经过精心的策划，有目的、有计划、有组织地反党反人民反社会主义。这家黑店所干的罪恶勾当，曾一度在中国的政治气候中刮起了一阵乌云。袁志先指出：这一场十分尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，性质是十分严重的。因为邓拓这一撮反党反社会主义的政治野心家，他们披着共产党员的红色外衣，拿的是一支杀人不见血的笔杆子，利用了《前线》、《北京日报》和《北京晚报》等等，作为他们的反党反社会主义的工具，和帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的反华大合唱相呼应，恶毒地向党、向人民、向社会主义猖狂地进攻，妄图复辟资本主义。他说：我们知道，碉堡是最容易从内部攻破的，如果不把这一小撮反党反社会主义分子彻底清除掉，如果让其阴谋得逞，那么我们的国家就会很快变颜色，我们人民就将蒙受极大的灾难！苏联现代修正主义者不就是用了锋芒毕露的毒箭向马克思列宁主义猖狂地进攻，用了五颜六色的糖衣炮弹搞“和平演变”，未动一刀一枪就使苏联改变颜色了吗？张泗洲说：我们同“三家村”这一伙反动分子的斗争，是一场十分严重的你死我活的阶级斗争，这伙反动分子胆敢在我们的首都、在毛主席的身旁，直接把矛头指向党中央和毛主席，祸患极其危险，不能不使人惊心动魄！我们必须百倍提高革命警惕性，斗争到底，彻底挖掉这家黑店内的一切恶根！
    参加座谈会的同志说：毛主席教导我们，阶级斗争是长期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。“三家村”这一小撮反动分子向党、向社会主义进攻，采取了十分阴险恶毒的手段，耍了许许多多的花招，真是绞尽了脑汁。但是，魔高一尺，道高一丈，我们也要用脑筋，敢想、敢写、敢于革命，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，紧紧握着毛泽东思想这一照妖镜，把一切牛鬼蛇神照得原形毕露。
    张泗洲同志指出：《前线》和《北京日报》有大问题，必须彻底弄清。大家纷纷质问《前线》和《北京日报》：在社会主义大革命中你们究竟扮演什么角色？先演苦肉计，邓拓化名出来保吴晗。吴晗保不住了，邓拓的马脚露出来了，你们又用假批判真掩护的手法保邓拓。大家追一个，你们认一个，你们希望就在这三个人身上作文章，是不行的！你们说，你们不是实行无产阶级挂帅，那么，你们挂的是什么？大家指出，你们保的不只是邓拓，而是保阵地、保实力、保老板，准备东山再起。这里面有大阴谋。你们不但在“三家村”大黑店猖狂向党进攻的时候作他们的工具，在文化大革命中仍然是他们向党进攻的阵地。你们胆敢在大革命的浪潮中，抛出那样露骨的“暗语”！这证明，你们是知道这个黑店的内幕，参与了黑店的阴谋的。这一点，你们是赖不掉的。
    大家一致指出，《前线》和《北京日报》要老老实实地把“三家村”大黑店的内幕和一切阴谋诡计，一五一十地交代出来。黄灿同志指出，“三家村”黑店放出的一切毒草我们当然要一一铲除，但是如果我们不追查内幕，深挖老根，那就上了他们的当了。北京是我们党中央和毛主席的所在地，如果斩草不除根，让他们留下祸根等待东山再起，那真太危险了。
    大家在发言中一致表示，要同这些牛鬼蛇神斗争到底。袁志先说：“我们工人在旧社会深受苦难，什么是甜，什么是苦，什么是好，什么是坏，我们最清楚。党和毛主席解放了我们，党和毛主席就是我们的生命。没有党中央和毛主席，我们就活不下去。我是带病来参加座谈会的，只要有一口气，我就要斗争下去，决不让邓拓等一小撮反动分子篡夺党的领导，实现资本主义复辟。”黄灿同志说：“我们是毛主席教导的革命战士，作无产阶级专政的工具，我们敢于斗争，敢于胜利，敢于刺刀见红。不管是三家村、四家村、几家村，不管有多大的靠山，不管有多大的来头，我们都要全部、干净、彻底地捣毁它。”
    参加座谈会的同志们都说，不管什么人，如果想改变中国的颜色，那就请他们准备好棺材吧！我们有毛泽东思想武装，掌握了鎯头、镰刀、枪杆子，能打垮一切黑帮，消灭一切牛鬼蛇神。
