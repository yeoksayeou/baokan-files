    The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is a new achievement of the Cultural Revolution.
    Seeing the actors on stage, dressed in national costumes, performing a revolutionary modern ballet, with vivid characters and fiery struggles, I was deeply moved. When I saw the tyrannical landlord Huang Shiren beat Yang Bailao to death, oppress Xi'er, and force Xi'er to live an inhuman life on the barren mountains, I couldn't help but want to smash that dark old society to pieces. At this time, the plot not only aroused my own class hatred, but also made me think of our territory of Taiwan, which is still occupied by US imperialism, and the compatriots in Taiwan who are still living in dire straits; and the two-thirds of the world's people who have not yet been liberated, and the millions of Yang Bailaos and Xi'ers who are still suffering from the oppression and persecution of the Huang Shirens in Taiwan and foreign countries. As a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, we must not only overthrow the Huang Shirens in China, rescue Xi'er, and avenge Yang Bailao, but also support the revolutionary forces of the people of the world, overthrow all the Huang Shirens in the world, rescue all the Xi'ers in the world, and avenge the Yang Bailaos of the world. When I saw the sunlight shining into the mountain cave where Xi'er lived, and the Eighth Route Army liberated Xi'er's hometown and executed the tyrannical landlord Huang Shiren, I couldn't restrain the joy in my heart and couldn't help but want to celebrate the victory with Xi'er, Dachun, and others. At this time, I thought: How did the victory come about? It was because of the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, just as the lyrics in the play sing, "The sun has come out, the sun is Mao Zedong, the sun is the Communist Party." This makes me love Chairman Mao even more, and love the Communist Party even more.
    The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" has strong revolutionary content. The changes in the plot are very necessary. Highlighting the peasants' spirit of resistance is highlighting the peasants' revolutionary spirit. It not only meets the requirements of the current ideological level of the people, but also conforms to historical truth. In fact, in the thousands of years of feudal society, the peasants did not just accept oppression, but constantly resisted. For two thousand years, there have been hundreds of peasant uprisings, some of which have spread throughout the country. Peasant uprisings have promoted historical progress.
    In addition to Dachun, Xi'er, and Yang Bailao, mass scenes have been added. These masses are full of class feelings and dare to fight against the reactionary rulers. Therefore, when I watched this play, I did not feel suppressed or heavy, but felt encouraged.
    From the artistic standard, the art of this ballet is also very good. The dance movements, the cooperation of the music, and the accompaniment are all good and very infectious. The music accompaniment adds gongs, drums, banhu, and sanxian, which sounds very cordial. Especially the banhu, which can express the inner activities of the characters. For example, when Xi'er complains, the sound of the banhu is like weeping and lamenting.
    In the company, gongs and drums are beaten for any happy event - welcoming new recruits, on the way to shooting practice, and during marches, now gongs and drums are also used on stage to express the joy of the masses after liberation. As soon as I hear it, I can't restrain my joyful mood.

    文化革命的新成果

    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》是文化革命的新成果。
    看到舞台上的演员，穿的是民族服装，跳的是革命的现代芭蕾舞，活生生的人物，火辣辣的斗争生活，我心里非常激动。当我看到恶霸地主黄世仁打死杨白劳，欺凌喜儿，把喜儿逼上荒山，过着非人的生活时，恨不能一拳把那黑暗的旧社会砸个稀巴烂。这时剧情不仅激发了自己的阶级仇恨心，而且也使我想到我国领土台湾还被美帝国主义霸占着，台湾的同胞还生活在水深火热之中；世界上还有三分之二的人民没有获得解放，有千千万万个杨白劳、喜儿还在受台湾的和外国的黄世仁的欺压迫害。作为一个解放军，不但要打倒中国的黄世仁，解救喜儿，为杨白劳报仇，而且要支持世界上人民革命力量，打倒世界上所有的黄世仁，解救全世界的喜儿，为全世界的杨白劳报仇雪恨。当我看到阳光照进了喜儿栖身的山洞，八路军解放了喜儿的家乡，处决了恶霸地主黄世仁时，我又抑制不住内心的喜悦，恨不能和喜儿、大春等人一起去庆贺胜利。这时我想：胜利是怎么得来的呢？是因为有党和毛主席的英明领导，正象剧中歌词唱的“太阳出来了，太阳就是毛泽东，太阳就是共产党。”这使我更加热爱毛主席，更加热爱共产党。
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》具有强烈的革命内容。剧情的更改，很有必要。突出了农民的反抗精神，就是突出了农民的革命精神。不仅符合当前人民思想水平的要求，而且也符合历史真实。事实上，在几千年的封建社会里，农民对压迫并不是逆来顺受，而是不断反抗的。两千年来，举行过千百次农民起义，有的起义遍及全国。农民起义推动了历史前进。
    除大春、喜儿、杨白劳外，增加了群众场面，这些群众富于阶级感情，敢于向反动统治者斗争。因此，我看这个剧的时候，没有压抑、沉重的感觉，而是感到鼓舞。
    从艺术标准看，这个舞剧的艺术也是很好的。舞蹈动作、音乐的配合、伴唱都是不错的，很感染人。音乐配乐增加了锣鼓、板胡、三弦，听了很亲切。特别是板胡，可以表现人物的内心活动，如喜儿诉苦时，配上板胡之声，如泣如诉。
    在连队，一有喜事就敲锣打鼓——欢迎新兵，打靶路上，行军时都这样，现在舞台上也运用锣鼓来表现群众解放后的欢快之情，我一听就抑制不住喜悦的心情。
