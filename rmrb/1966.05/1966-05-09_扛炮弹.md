    Carrying Shells
    Ren Haiying, Deputy Observation and Communications Chief of a Naval Unit
    Thunder of guns, artillery support, the sea shouts, urging from behind,
    Carry! Box after box of shells rushes to the gun position...
    The night is deep, the sky so dark,
    A streak of fire, a flash of light,
    Quick! Chase forward while it's bright.
    "Who?!" "Old Lei!"
    "You rest, let me carry."
    "No! Is the revolution afraid of hardship and fatigue?!"
    "Our fathers weren't afraid of blood flowing,
    Heads held high, the three great mountains were shattered.
    Come, put it on my shoulder!"
    —Walking as if flying!...
