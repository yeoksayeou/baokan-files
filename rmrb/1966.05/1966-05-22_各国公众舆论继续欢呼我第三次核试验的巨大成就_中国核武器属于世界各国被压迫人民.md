    This newspaper provides comprehensive reporting. According to Xinhua News Agency: Public opinion in various countries continues to warmly acclaim the success of China's third nuclear test. It is emphasized that the success of China's nuclear test is an encouragement to the people of oppressed countries in their struggle for liberation and a powerful blow to the U.S. imperialists' nuclear blackmail.
    The "Unity Daily" in Chittagong, East Pakistan, published an editorial on the 12th regarding the successful nuclear explosion by China containing thermonuclear materials, stating: China's continuous achievements in the atomic field are appreciated throughout the world. The editorial said: The United States is doing everything possible to "isolate" great China, attempting to realize its ambition to dominate the entire Southeast Asia. The U.S. Seventh Fleet, equipped with nuclear weapons, travels to and from the Indian Ocean, attempting to threaten the people of emerging countries in Southeast Asia. The editorial said that China's achievements undoubtedly give a severe blow to the malicious plots of the United States.
    The "Holiday" weekly in Dacca published an editorial on the 15th pointing out that under the circumstances of U.S. encirclement and confrontation, China has more reason than any other country to develop its own nuclear defense forces. Washington's crazy talk about attacking China and the continuous expansion of the Vietnam War have forced China to develop its own nuclear defense forces.
    The editorial said: Those major powers that possess a large number of nuclear weapons and conduct underground nuclear tests have no right to question whether others are doing it appropriately.
    The delegation of activists expanding the readership of "People's China" in Japan, in a telegram to the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association and the "People's China" magazine, said that the success of China's third nuclear test "is a huge blow to the U.S. imperialist nuclear threat policy and an infinite inspiration to the struggle of the people of all countries who resolutely resist U.S. imperialist aggression."
    The telegram said that the delegation "sincerely supports your country's press communiqué and declares to jointly struggle for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons."
    This delegation, led by Tanigawa Toshizo, Standing Director of the Japan-China Friendship Association, sent the telegram to the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association and the "People's China" magazine while visiting Shenyang on the 13th.
    Wiyando, Secretary of the Standing Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Asian-African Lawyers Conference, said in Conakry on the 14th that the success of China's third nuclear test is not only a victory for the Chinese people, but also a victory for the people of all countries who are fighting for independence and freedom, especially the people of Asian and African countries who are resolutely fighting against imperialism and new and old colonialism headed by the United States.
    He pointed out that this is a serious blow to the U.S. imperialists who are frantically pursuing a policy of nuclear blackmail and carrying out war provocations, because nuclear weapons in the hands of revolutionary people like the Chinese people are a strong guarantee for world peace and a great contribution to strengthening the liberation struggle of the oppressed and exploited people of all countries.
    He expressed his conviction that under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people will achieve greater achievements in science and technology.
    Farah Abdi, a member of the Somali National Assembly, said in a letter to Xinhua News Agency on the 15th: "The news of the great People's Republic of China's third nuclear explosion has made us rejoice."
    He said: "For us Africans, China's development of nuclear weapons is to oppose the blackmail and suppression by U.S. imperialism of the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed people and nations."
    In his letter, he said: "The third nuclear test not only strengthens the defense capabilities of the People's Republic of China, but also provides encouragement and new momentum to the struggle against U.S. imperialism and for national liberation, while making a great contribution to world peace."
    Ahmed Ibrahim, a representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa), issued a statement here on the 11th: "The oppressed, exploited, and discriminated people of Azania hail the successful third nuclear explosion of the heroic people of the People's Republic of China."
    The statement pointed out: "Since the People's Republic of China exploded its first atomic bomb, imperialism headed by the United States has been uneasy because it means that the era of imperialist nuclear monopoly has passed. Now the oppressed people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, who are suffering from U.S. aggression, no longer have to worry about the threat of U.S. imperialist nuclear aggression in their revolutionary struggles against imperialism and new and old colonialism."
    The statement said that China's new nuclear test will strengthen the world's forces striving for true peace, because this bomb belongs to the forces in the world that are resolutely opposed to the exploitation of man by man and the exploitation of small countries by large countries. The statement pointed out: "The purpose of making this bomb is to stop imperialist aggression and protect the national sovereignty of newly independent countries."
    Baron Ara, Chairman of the Belgian Action for Peace and Independence of All Peoples, who is visiting our country, issued a statement in Beijing on China's third nuclear test, saying that it is precisely because of the United States that the people of other countries have to arm themselves, because they are either threatened with total destruction or will be permanently ruled by the United States, and this is unacceptable to anyone.
    Referring to the Chinese government's proposal to convene a summit conference of world leaders to discuss the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, Baron Ara said in his statement: "As long as the United States does not accept this proposal (Americans are even increasingly talking about arming West Germany with nuclear weapons), the people of the whole world must abandon the United States and its policies and isolate it until it gives in. This is what we are going to do in Belgium. We will adopt the French method and cancel the bases of the North Atlantic Treaty on our territory, which are the bases of U.S. imperialism."

### 各国公众舆论继续欢呼我第三次核试验的巨大成就  中国核武器属于世界各国被压迫人民

    各国公众舆论继续欢呼我第三次核试验的巨大成就
    中国核武器属于世界各国被压迫人民
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国公众舆论继续热烈欢呼中国第三次核试验成功。强调指出中国核试验成功是对被压迫各国人民争取解放斗争的鼓舞，对美帝国主义核讹诈的有力打击。
    东巴基斯坦吉大港的《团结报》十二日就中国进行含有热核材料的核爆炸成功发表社论说：中国在原子领域内不断取得的成就在全世界各地得到赞赏。社论说：美国千方百计要使伟大的中国“孤立”，力图实现称霸整个东南亚的野心。配备核武器的美国第七舰队往来于印度洋，企图威胁东南亚新兴国家的人民。社论说，中国的成就无疑给予美国恶毒的图谋以严重的打击。
    达卡《假日》周刊十五日发表社论指出，在美国包围和对峙的情况下，中国较之任何其他国家更有理由发展它自己的核防御力量。华盛顿疯狂地谈论要进攻中国和不断扩大越南战争，都使中国不得不发展它自己的核防御力量。
    社论说：那些拥有大量核武器，并且进行地下核试验的大国没有权利质问别人这样做是否适宜。
    日本扩大《人民中国》读者积极分子访华代表团在致中日友协和《人民中国》杂志社的一份电报中说，中国第三次核试验成功“是对美帝国主义核威胁政策的巨大打击，是对坚决抵抗美帝国主义侵略的各国人民斗争的无限激励。”
    电报说，代表团“衷心地支持贵国的新闻公报，并声明为全面禁止和彻底废除核武器而共同斗争。”
    由日中友协常务理事长谷川敏三率领的这个代表团，是十三日在访问沈阳的时候致电中日友协和《人民中国》杂志社的。
    亚非法律工作者会议执行委员会常设书记处书记维扬多十四日在科纳克里发表谈话说，中国第三次核试验的成功，不仅是中国人民的胜利，而且是所有正为独立和自由而斗争的各国人民的胜利，特别是正为反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义而进行坚决斗争的亚非各国人民的胜利。
    他指出，这是对正在疯狂地推行核讹诈政策和进行战争挑衅的美帝国主义者的严重打击，因为掌握在象中国人民这样的革命人民手中的核武器，是对世界和平的强有力的保证，是对加强被压迫和被剥削各国人民争取解放斗争的巨大贡献。
    他表示确信，中国人民在毛泽东主席的领导下，将在科学技术方面获得更大的成就。
    索马里国民议会议员法拉赫·阿卜迪十五日在给新华社的一封信中说：“伟大的中华人民共和国的第三次核爆炸的消息使我们感到欢欣鼓舞。”
    他说：“对于我们非洲人来说，中国制成核武器，是要反对美帝国主义对一切被压迫的人民和民族的革命斗争进行的讹诈和镇压。”
    他在信件中说：“第三次核试验不仅增强了中华人民共和国的国防力量，而且是对反对美帝国主义和争取民族解放的斗争的一种鼓舞和新的动力，同时对世界和平作出了巨大的贡献。”
    阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会代表艾哈迈德·易卜拉欣十一日在这里发表声明说：“阿扎尼亚被压迫、被剥削和被歧视的人民欢呼中华人民共和国英勇的人民第三次核爆炸成功。”
    声明指出：“自从中华人民共和国爆炸第一颗原子弹以来，以美国为首的帝国主义一直表示不安，因为这意味着，帝国主义核垄断的时代已经过去了。现在遭受美国侵略的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲被压迫人民在他们反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的革命斗争中不再担心美帝国主义的核侵略威胁了。”
    声明说，中国的新的核试验将加强世界争取真正和平的力量，因为这颗炸弹是属于世界上坚决反对人剥削人、大国剥削小国的那支力量的。声明指出：“制造这颗炸弹是为了制止帝国主义侵略和保护新独立国家的国家主权。”
    正在我国访问的比利时争取和平与各国人民独立行动主席阿拉男爵在北京就中国进行第三次核试验发表声明说，正是由于美国的缘故，其他各国人民都不得不进行武装，因为他们不是受到全面毁灭的威胁，就是要永受美国的统治，而这是谁也不能接受的。
    阿拉男爵在声明中谈到中国政府关于召开世界各国首脑会议讨论全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器的建议时说：“只要美国一天不接受这一建议（美国人甚至越来越多地谈论用核武器武装西德），全世界人民就必须摒弃美国和它的政策，使它陷于孤立直到它让步为止。这就是我们在比利时所要做的，我们将采用法国的那一套办法，取消北大西洋公约在我国领土上的基地，也就是美帝国主义的基地。”
