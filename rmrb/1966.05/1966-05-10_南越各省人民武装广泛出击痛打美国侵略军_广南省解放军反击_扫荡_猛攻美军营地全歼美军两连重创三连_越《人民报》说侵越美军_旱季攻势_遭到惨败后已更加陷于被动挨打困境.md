    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 9th – According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Nam and Binh Dinh Provinces in South Vietnam annihilated more than 800 enemy troops in mid-April, including 554 American invading troops and 270 South Korean puppet troops; shot down and damaged nine enemy aircraft.

    On April 15th and 16th, the Liberation Armed Forces valiantly intercepted three battalions of enemy troops who were "mopping up" in Dai Loc County, Quang Nam Province, killing and wounding 404 enemy troops, including 374 American invading troops. Among the American troops killed and wounded, one company was completely annihilated and three companies were severely crippled.

    At dawn on April 16th, the Liberation Armed Forces took advantage of their victory to attack the American military camp 500 meters west of Feng Shu Village, Dien Quang Commune, Dien Ban County. Under the cover of intense mortar fire, Liberation Army soldiers engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. After an hour of fighting, one American company was completely annihilated, killing and wounding more than 180 enemy troops.

    On April 19th, the South Korean puppet troops stationed in the Ngo Boi area of ​​Tuy Phuoc County, Binh Dinh Province, under the cover of American aircraft and artillery, went to Phước Thắng Commune, Tuy Phuoc County, to carry out a "mopping-up operation." The Liberation Armed Forces and local guerrillas bravely fought back against the enemy. After a day of fierce fighting, 270 South Korean puppet troops were annihilated, thwarting the enemy's "mopping-up operation."

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi – According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, in the 18 days up to April 11th, the Liberation Armed Forces of Phu Yen Province in South Vietnam fought 45 battles in the Tuy An, Dong Xuan, and Son Hoa areas, crushing the large-scale "mopping-up operations" of five battalions of American invading troops and two battalions of puppet troops. According to preliminary reports, a total of 656 enemy troops were annihilated, including 477 American invading troops; eight enemy aircraft were shot down, and a large number of weapons were seized. In this battle, the enemy artillery, dazed and confused, panicked and smashed one of their own helicopters to pieces.

    On April 23rd, the Liberation Armed Forces of Khanh Hoa Province, in an attack on a main force battalion of puppet troops stationed in Lac An Village, Ninh Hoa County, annihilated more than 150 enemy troops, destroyed three enemy vehicles, and seized a batch of weapons and ammunition.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 8th – The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 8th, pointing out that the American aggressors, after suffering a major defeat in the dry season, have been more deeply plunged into a passive predicament on the South Vietnamese battlefield.

    The commentary pointed out that since the beginning of this year, the Johnson administration has tried its best to scrape together cannon fodder and throw it into the South Vietnamese battlefield, carried out new military deployments, and launched a large-scale so-called "dry season offensive." However, four months have passed, and the dry season is coming to an end. The American aggressors' various "mopping-up operations" have been defeated by the army and people of South Vietnam.

    The commentary pointed out that all the liberated areas in South Vietnam have laid a dragnet for the American aggressors. The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces, including the main force, local forces, and guerrillas, have made great progress in all aspects. The American mobile forces cannot cope with guerrilla warfare, let alone eliminate the main force of the Liberation Army. On the contrary, tens of thousands of American mobile forces have been eliminated, making the morale of the American military even more severely depressed.

    南越各省人民武装广泛出击痛打美国侵略军
    广南省解放军反击“扫荡”猛攻美军营地全歼美军两连重创三连
    越《人民报》说侵越美军“旱季攻势”遭到惨败后已更加陷于被动挨打困境
    新华社河内九日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广南省和平定省解放武装力量，四月中旬歼灭敌人八百多名，其中有美国侵略军五百五十四名，南朝鲜帮凶军二百七十名；击落击伤敌机九架。
    四月十五日和十六日，解放武装力量在广南省大禄县英勇阻击前去“扫荡”的三个营敌军，打死打伤敌人四百零四名，其中有美国侵略军三百七十四名。在被打死打伤的美军中一个连被全歼，三个连遭重创。
    十六日凌晨，解放武装力量乘胜袭击距奠盘县奠光乡丰黍村西面五百米的美军营地，在猛烈的迫击炮火掩护下，解放军战士们同敌人展开肉搏战，经过一个小时的战斗，全歼美军一个连，共打死打伤敌人一百八十多名。
    四月十九日，驻扎在平定省绥福县鹅培地区的南朝鲜帮凶军在美国的飞机大炮掩护下，开到绥福县福胜乡进行“扫荡”。解放武装力量和当地游击队沉着勇敢地还击敌人，进行了一天的激烈战斗，歼灭南朝鲜帮凶军二百七十名，粉碎了敌人的这次“扫荡”。
    新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方富安省解放武装力量在到四月十一日为止的十八天中，在绥安、同春、山和地区，战斗四十五次，粉碎了五营美国侵略军和两营伪军的大“扫荡”。据初步消息，共歼敌六百五十六名，其中有美国侵略军四百七十七名；击落敌机八架，缴获大批武器。在这一战斗中，被打得晕头转向的敌人炮兵惊慌失措地把他们自己的一架直升飞机打得粉碎。
    庆和省解放武装力量，四月二十三日在袭击驻扎在宁和县乐安村的一个伪军主力营的战斗中，歼敌一百五十多名，击毁敌军车三辆，缴获一批武器和弹药。
    新华社河内八日电　越南《人民报》八日发表评论指出，美国侵略者在旱季遭到大败以后，在南越战场上更深地陷入了被动困境。
    评论指出，从今年年初以来，约翰逊政府竭力搜罗炮灰投入南越战场，进行了新的军事部署，展开了大规模的所谓“旱季攻势”。但是，四个月过去了，旱季也快要结束了，美国侵略者的各次“扫荡”都已被南越军民打败。
    评论指出，越南南方的各个解放区都给美国侵略者布下了天罗地网。包括主力部队、地方部队和游击队在内的越南南方解放武装力量在各方面都有了飞跃的发展。美国机动部队对付不了游击战争，更消灭不了解放军的主力，相反，美国机动部队自己却被消灭了几万名，使得美军士气更加严重地低落。
