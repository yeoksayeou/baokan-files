    Where to Start "Transformation" From?
    Where does the revolutionization of an enterprise start? Does it start from the masses or from the leadership? The Shenyang Textile Factory took three detours in learning from Daqing, and finally achieved successful experience: To learn from Daqing and realize the revolutionization of an enterprise, we must first start with the "transformation" of the leadership. When the leadership is revolutionized, the masses will actively mobilize, and the enterprise will undergo revolutionary changes.
    The comrades of Shenyang Textile Factory have grasped the essence of learning from Daqing in this understanding.
    Leadership, as the name implies, should be ahead of the masses and correctly guide them forward. If the leadership lags behind the masses or stands beside them, it loses its leadership role. How can it lead a revolutionary team? How can the revolutionization of the enterprise be achieved?
    Daqing is a model of enterprise revolutionization, and also a model of leadership revolutionization. With a revolutionary leadership team like Daqing, a revolutionary team like Daqing could be brought out, and a revolutionary enterprise could be created. The comrades of Shenyang Textile Factory said: "Repeated setbacks have made us realize a truth: a revolutionary who wants to lead others in revolution must first revolutionize himself. If he does not revolutionize himself, it is impossible to lead others in revolution." This is an undeniable truth. Daqing acted according to this truth, and other Daqing-style enterprises across the country also acted according to this truth. It can be said that this is an indispensable path for the revolutionization of an enterprise. If you really want to run an enterprise into a socialist revolutionary enterprise, the "heads" of the enterprise must, like the comrades of Shenyang Textile Factory, be determined to stand at the forefront of the entire factory's workforce, take the lead in the revolution, take the lead in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's works, and transform the objective world while transforming the subjective world, transforming the entire appearance of the enterprise.
    Under the encouragement of the slogan "Learn from Daqing, catch up with Daqing, surpass Daqing, and create more Daqing-style enterprises," many factories and enterprises are working hard and moving towards the goal of Daqing-style enterprises. It is hoped that the comrades in these factories will read this letter from the comrades in Shenyang Textile Factory, and at the same time ask themselves: Have they, like the Shenyang Textile Factory, put the issue of "head" revolutionization on their work agenda?

### 从哪里“化”起？

    从哪里“化”起？
    企业革命化从哪里“化”起？是从群众开始，还是从领导开始？沈阳织布厂学大庆走了三次弯路，终于取得了成功经验：学大庆，实现企业革命化，要先从领导“化”起，领导革命化了，群众就会积极行动起来，企业就会发生革命性的变化。
    沈阳市织布厂同志们的这个体会，抓住了学大庆的根本。
    领导，顾名思义，要走在群众的前面，正确地引导群众前进。如果领导落在群众的后边，或者站在群众的旁边，这就失掉了领导作用，怎么可能带出一支革命化的队伍呢？怎么可能实现企业的革命化呢？
    大庆，是企业革命化的典范，也是领导革命化的典范。有了大庆革命化的领导班子，才带出了大庆那样革命化的队伍，创造了革命化的企业。沈阳织布厂的同志说：“几次反复，使我们认识到了一个真理：一个革命者要领导别人革命，首先要自己革命，自己不革命，就不可能领导好别人革命。”这是一个千真万确的真理。大庆是按照这个真理做的，全国其他大庆式企业，也是按照这个真理做的。可以说，这是企业革命化的一条必由之路。如果真正想把企业办成一个社会主义的革命化的企业，企业的“头头”们就得象沈阳市织布厂的同志们那样，下定决心，走到全厂职工队伍的最前列，带头革命，带头活学活用毛泽东同志著作，在改造主观世界的同时改造客观世界，改造整个企业的面貌。
    在“学大庆、赶大庆、超大庆、创造更多的大庆式企业”这个口号的鼓舞下，许多工厂企业都在奋发努力，向大庆式企业的目标前进。希望这些工厂的同志们读一读沈阳市织布厂同志的这封来信，同时问一问自己：是不是也象沈阳市织布厂那样，已经把“头头”革命化的问题摆到自己的工作日程上了？
