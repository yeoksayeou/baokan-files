    U.S. Newspapers Lament the Johnson Administration's Plight of Internal and External Isolation and Impasse
    The U.S. War of Aggression Against Vietnam Is Precarious. A Wind of Anxiety Sweeps Through Washington.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 26th dispatch from New York: U.S. bourgeois commentator Walter Lippmann published an article in the *New York Herald Tribune* on the 25th, admitting that the United States is in an impasse in South Vietnam and is waging a "hopeless war."
    Lippmann wrote that the U.S. troops currently in South Vietnam are "waging a hopeless war in a hopeless environment. The U.S. troops may soon increase to 400,000, and they are undertaking the obligation to achieve an unattainable goal, namely, to establish a pro-American and free South Vietnam. Little do they know that on that continent, they have no important allies, while the enemy is extremely numerous."
    Lippmann said that one of the "most difficult" problems currently facing the United States is: "Whether the process of disintegration of the Saigon government and its troops (referring to the South Vietnamese puppet regime and the puppet army) can be prevented or reversed. Of course, the official view is that it can. But there is no evidence to confirm the official subjective thinking." Lippmann pointed out that, on the contrary, more and more evidence shows that Nguyen Cao Ky and his ilk are inevitably opposed by the South Vietnamese people, and it is impossible for the South Vietnamese puppet clique to "unite for war."
    Lippmann said, "Unless this situation changes fundamentally, we (the United States) will increasingly fight alone in a country (referring to South Vietnam) where the army is disintegrating and the government has no prestige," "fighting alone in a hostile environment." Lippmann pointed out that in this situation, it will be more difficult for the United States to salvage its defeat in South Vietnam. He mentioned that some people in the U.S. political circles are now advocating "bombing Haiphong and Hanoi" in an attempt to find a way out. But Lippmann admitted that whether it is expanding the war on land or in the air, the United States cannot win the war of aggression against Vietnam. Lippmann advocated adopting a "holding" strategy, but he could not answer the question: How can the United States salvage the defeat by adopting this strategy?
    According to Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Washington: U.S. bourgeois newspapers have recently revealed the anxiety of the U.S. ruling group due to the repeated failures of the war of aggression against Vietnam, as well as its increasingly isolated predicament at home and abroad.
    The *New York Times* published a dispatch from its Washington chief correspondent James Reston in its May 21-22 combined issue, saying, "In Washington, a wind of doubt and even anxiety is faintly blowing within the government, and this is not surprising. The problems facing the President and his main advisors in Vietnam and elsewhere are endless, and tension is showing."
    The dispatch then talked about how Johnson himself admitted that he sometimes felt "depressed," and at such times, "he went to the mountainous countryside of Texas to seek solace." The dispatch also pointed out, "Lately he has been particularly prone to temper tantrums and self-contradiction. One day he went to Princeton University hoping to reconcile with the intellectuals who criticized him, and the next day he implied in Chicago that those who criticized him were not only cowardly but also possibly unpatriotic"; "One day he called on people to support his war policy, and the next day he impatiently yelled at people to be patient. One day he asked critics for understanding, and the next day he attacked them as 'neurotic people,' ... imperiously demanding 'unity.'"
    The dispatch believes that the main reason for this situation is a series of disappointing events in South Vietnam. It said, "The cause of the current nervous tension also has human factors." It pointed out that the physical exhaustion and nervous tension of senior government officials "cannot be overestimated. They work eighteen hours a day, the President often longer, they attend endless meetings, constantly testify before Congress," and also have to deal with "a constant barrage of criticism at home and abroad." Speeches and talks by senior officials are often contradictory or inconsistent with each other, "each speech seems to be self-contained, with no connection to any guiding principles or policies."
    The May 19 issue of the *Washington Post* pointed out in an article that the Johnson government's continuous expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam has caused "panic" within the Democratic Party. The article said, "Johnson is well aware that criticism of him – and of the U.S. role in Vietnam – is growing day by day. He knows that the critics are no longer limited to the peace groups. Last Saturday, at the Maine Democratic Party's annual meeting in Portland, a resolution expressing the support of 700 delegates for President Johnson on the Vietnam issue was quietly shelved."

    美国报刊哀叹约翰逊政府陷于内外孤立困境走投无路
    美国侵越战争岌岌可危　华盛顿刮起焦虑之风
    新华社二十六日讯　纽约消息：美国资产阶级评论员李普曼二十五日在《纽约先驱论坛报》上发表一篇文章，承认美国在南越走投无路，它进行的是一场“无望的战争”。
    李普曼写道，目前在南越的美国军队是在“一个无望的环境中进行一场无望的战争。美国军队可能很快就增至四十万人，他们承担了要获致一个无法达到的目的的义务，即建立一个亲美的自由的南越。殊不知在那个大陆上，他们既没有重要的盟国，而敌人却是极为人多势众。”
    李普曼说，美国当前面临的一个“最困难”的问题是：“西贡政府及其部队（指南越傀儡政权和伪军）分崩离析的过程是否能够予以制止或扭转。自然，官方的看法是认为可以的。但是没有什么证据证实官方的主观想法”。李普曼指出，相反地，越来越多的证据说明：阮高其之流不可避免地遭到南越人民的反对，南越傀儡集团内部也不可能“团结起来进行战争”。
    李普曼说，“除非这种情况发生根本变化，我们（美国）将会越来越在一个军队分崩离析和政府没有什么威信的国家（指南越）里孤军作战”，“在一个遭到敌视的环境中单独作战”。李普曼指出，在这种情况下，美国将更难于挽救在南越的败局。他谈到，美国政界一些人现在正在鼓吹“轰炸海防和河内”，企图从中找到出路。但是李普曼承认，无论在陆地上还是空中扩大战争，美国都是无法打赢侵越战争的。李普曼鼓吹采取“固守”战略，但是他并不能回答这个问题：美国采取这种战略又如何能够挽救败局。
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国资产阶级报刊最近透露了美国统治集团由于侵越战争连遭失败而焦躁不安以及它在国内外越来越陷于孤立的窘状。
    五月二十一日——二十二日合刊的《纽约时报》刊登驻华盛顿首席记者赖斯顿写的一篇通讯说，“在华盛顿，政府内部正隐约地吹拂着一股怀疑甚至焦虑之风，而这是不足为奇的。总统及其主要顾问在越南及其他地方所面临的问题是没完没了的，紧张状态正在显露出来。”
    通讯接着谈到，约翰逊本人承认，他有时感到“意志消沉”，而在这种时候，“他就到得克萨斯州多山的乡间去寻找慰藉”。通讯还指出，“近来他特别容易发脾气和自相矛盾。头一天他去普林斯顿大学希望同批评他的知识分子取得和解，第二天他却在芝加哥暗示，那些批评他的人不仅是胆小怕事，而且可能是不爱国的”；“头一天呼吁人们支持他的战争政策，第二天他却不耐烦地大叫大嚷要人们忍耐。头一天他要求批评他的人取得谅解，第二天他却攻击他们是‘神经质的人’，……专横地要求‘团结一致’”。
    通讯认为，造成这种情况的主要原因是南越局势发生了一系列令人失望的事件。它说，“造成目前神经紧张的原因还有人的因素”。它指出，对于政府高级人员的体力消耗和神经紧张状态，是怎么估计也不会过分的。他们每天工作十八小时，总统往往更长一些，他们参加没完没了的会议、不断在国会作证”，而且还要应付“国内外不断发生的一阵阵批评”。高级官员们的演说和讲话往往前后矛盾或彼此矛盾，“每一篇演说看来都自成一体，同任何指导原则或政策都毫无关系”。
    五月十九日一期《华盛顿邮报》在一篇文章中指出，约翰逊政府不断扩大侵越战争的做法，在民主党内引起了“恐慌”。文章说，“约翰逊十分明白，对他——以及对美国在越南的作用——的批评一天比一天多。他知道，提出批评的已不限于和平集团的人。上星期六，在缅因州民主党在波特兰举行的年会上，一项表示七百名与会代表在越南问题上支持约翰逊总统的决议案被悄悄地搁置起来了。”
