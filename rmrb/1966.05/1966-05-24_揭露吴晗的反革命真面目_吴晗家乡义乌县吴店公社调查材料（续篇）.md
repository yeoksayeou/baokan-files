    Exposing Wu Han's Counter-Revolutionary True Colors
    —Investigation Materials from Wudian Commune, Yiwu County, Wu Han's Hometown (Continued)
    Qi Li Meng Jin
    (III) As early as the 1930s, Wu Han wholeheartedly relied on reactionary figures such as Hu Shi and Jiang Tingfu, acting as a running dog of the Kuomintang reactionaries.

    Wu Han boasted that he had "unconditionally accepted historical materialism" as early as "1930," and that he had already "sympathized," "cared about," and "yearned for" revolution, "opposing" the Kuomintang reactionaries "in writing, verbally, and even in action."

    What is the truth?

    In this investigation, we collected a batch of letters. These letters were handwritten by Wu Han to his elementary school teacher, local gentry Yang Zhibing (from Wudian, Yiwu), between 1931 and 1932. In these letters, Wu Han triumphantly revealed his political stance and attitude at the time.

    (1) Hu Shi's "Prized Student," a Slave of American Slaves

    In a letter to Yang Zhibing on August 8, 1931, Wu Han said:

    "I applied to both Peking University and Tsinghua University this year, and was rejected by one and accepted by the other. ... It is extremely difficult to find a position within Tsinghua University. ... Now, people such as Gu and Hu (Shi) are trying to find a way, and have promised to make a long-term plan. ... When You Ji went to see Teacher Shizhi a month ago, ... he asked me if I needed money. If I wanted money, he said, he would take out his purse and give it to me." "The teachers have given me a great deal of spiritual encouragement." (Note: The punctuation in the quotations was added by the investigators, the same below.)

    In a letter dated August 27, 1931, he said:

    "The matter of admission has made great progress recently and can be relieved of worry. I went to see Mr. Shizhi the other day, and he said that he had sent a special letter to Tsinghua University President Weng Wenhao, Dean of the Faculty of Arts Feng Youlan, and Head of the History Department Jiang Tingfu, and sent my Hu Yinglin Chronology to Tsinghua University, instructing them to find me a position at Tsinghua University. I have received a reply, promising to find a job in the History Department, under the title of teaching assistant or other undecided title, and the job is to sort out the archives of the Great Within, with a remuneration that can at least maintain my life. Teacher Shizhi was also afraid that I would not have enough money, so he borrowed another 40 yuan for the cost of buying books after entering school, and told me to enter school with peace of mind, and he would find a way to handle everything. His great kindness and deep feelings make me feel ashamed."

    In the same letter, Wu Han also said:

    "However, coincidences happen in the world. At Yanjing University, Professor Gu Jiegang of the History Department, Director of the Chinese Department Ma Jian, and Chairman of the Library Committee Hong Weilian heard this news and told me that they had found a way for me to find a position in the Harvard-Yanjing Society (Wu Han's note: The Harvard-Yanjing Society is a cultural institution jointly established by Harvard University in the United States and Yanjing University in China). Although it is not yet decided (because this society must meet in mid-October, and this matter must be decided at the meeting), it can be determined that it will be successful. Even if it is not successful (they are in charge of this society, and there is no way it will not be successful), they can gather strength from everyone and get by. They also told me to enter school with peace of mind, and that they would take care of everything, and there would be no problem. If you need anything, just ask, and don't be shy. They also advised me to transfer to Yanjing University next year, and all procedures can be handled on my behalf. In his words, it seemed that he was dissatisfied with the fact that I did not apply to Yanjing University but entered Tsinghua University, and that Teacher Shizhi alone arranged the matter of entering Tsinghua University."

    In a letter dated September 9, 1931, he said:

    "In the morning of the ninth, I met with Dean of Studies Mr. Zhang Zigao and Head of the History Department Mr. Jiang Tingfu, who were both entrusted by Teacher Hu to take care of me and were very impressed with me. Regarding the matter of work-study, Mr. Jiang has decided to propose it in the name of the History Department at the teaching affairs meeting next week, which is just a matter of procedure, but in fact there is no problem at all."

    Look, Wu Han, this self-proclaimed "historical materialist" who "never harbored any illusions" about the Kuomintang as early as 1930, opened his mouth "Teacher Hu," closed his mouth "Teacher Hu," and got along so enthusiastically with American imperialist lackeys such as Hu Shi and Jiang Tingfu! Between them, one "entrusted to take care of," and the other was flattered; one bestowed small favors, and the other was "ashamed." Wu Han, in front of Hu Shi, had the demeanor of a slave!

    In fact, Wu Han was not satisfied with being Hu Shi's slave. Wasn't he? He coveted the so-called cultural institution run by the American master, the Harvard-Yanjing Society, and actively sought to enter it. He didn't want to be a foreign slave, but was vying to be one. By January 1946, in the letter co-signed by Wu Han and Pan Guangdan, Fei Xiaotong, and others to U.S. President's Special Envoy Marshall, his foreign slave nature was completely exposed.

    (2) Burying Himself in "Sorting Out National Heritage," and Imitating the Tone of the Masters, Attacking and Slandering the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement

    Around the "September 18th Incident," the anti-Japanese national salvation movement surged across the country. What was Wu Han doing at this time?

    In a letter to Yang Zhibing on September 9, 1931, Wu Han said:

    "Within three years, I have decided to devote myself to the history of the Ming Dynasty. As for the history of the Qin and Han dynasties, I have been deeply involved in it for a long time, and I cannot forget it in my spare time. However, it has been reduced to a vassal. ... Only the Ming History used is borrowed from the internal library and is not my own. When there are key points and my own new interpretations, I cannot make annotations and notes on each one. It is like making a wedding dress for others, and it is not possible to prepare a copy myself!"

    Soon, Wu Han said in another letter:

    "Recently, I found a frame of Ming History, which I recite morning and evening. He also obtained a complete collection of Qian Daxin's Qianyan Hall, including a volume of Yan Zhou Shanren's chronology, which has been recorded by Xi Di by year, because its narrative is too simple, and it does not mention its academic and ideological origins and achievements. Place the Four Parts Draft and Yujian Zunwen, Yanshan Hall Collection, Taicang Zhi, and contemporary human collections on the desk, and supplement and correct them below as I obtain them. It is expected that after a month, I can complete a first draft and make it into a book with a slight correction. In the future, if there is time, I also plan to combine the chronologies of Yang Shengan, Jiao Ruohou, and Hu Yuanrui into one, to form a chronology of academic thought in the Zhengde, Jiajing, Longqing, and Wanli periods of the Ming Dynasty, which would be a great pleasure."

    At the end of 1931, the Kuomintang reactionaries' policy of national betrayal and surrender further aroused the dissatisfaction of the people across the country. Under the leadership of our party, young students in North China organized petition groups and went south to Beijing to petition, demanding to rise up and resist Japan. What was Wu Han doing at this time? On December 27 of that year, he wrote to Yang Zhibing:

    "The students of our school, ... organized a petition group to go to Beijing a few days ago, and went south on the 22nd and arrived in Beijing today. I stayed at the school to serve due to special circumstances."

    Was Wu Han safe staying at school? He told Yang Zhibing in his letter:

    "There may be various rumors in the south about the matters here, which are not worth believing. Moreover, the military and police are extremely vigilant, and there will be no accidents."

    In January 1932, the national anti-Japanese and anti-Chiang movement entered its climax. What was Wu Han's state of mind at that time? He wrote to Yang Zhibing three days before the "January 28th Incident":

    "Recently, I have been plagued by various internal and external phenomena that are worthy of tears, and everything is lifeless. ... The social atmosphere is deteriorating, and scholars only know how to read sex histories and black curtain novels by frivolous writers at sea. High-level classics have long been placed in the dung pit, as Wu Zhihui said. The general reformers do not know the Han, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, let alone the Zhou and Qin dynasties. What else can be said about the fate of the world!"

    Look, in the great anti-Japanese national salvation movement, Wu Han's actions were so incompatible with the broad masses of people and patriotic young students! Around the "September 18th Incident," the broad masses of patriotic youth actively devoted themselves to the anti-Japanese national salvation movement; while Wu Han, on the other hand, hid in piles of ancient books all day long, holding the Ming History, "reciting it morning and evening," "making annotations and notes," and engaging in "sorting out national heritage" and "saving the country through reading." Later, with the in-depth development of the anti-Japanese national salvation movement, students in North China went south to petition one after another; while Wu Han, on the other hand, stayed at the school and complained, saying that the anti-Japanese national salvation movement "disrupted" his quiet reading environment, "hating it very much." After the "January 28th Incident," the national anti-Chiang salvation movement entered its climax, and a good situation appeared in the anti-Japanese struggle; while Wu Han, on the other hand, attacked and slandered the vigorous anti-Japanese and anti-Chiang movement as an "evil phenomenon," saying that the situation at the time was "the social atmosphere is deteriorating" and "everything is lifeless." At that time, under the guidance of our party, a large number of intellectuals jumped out of piles of ancient books and actively devoted themselves to the anti-Japanese national salvation movement. Wu Han was deeply dissatisfied with this and attacked these revolutionary youths as "general reformers" who "do not know the Han, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, let alone the Zhou and Qin dynasties." Wu Han's words were exactly the same as the reactionary remarks of Hu Shi and his ilk!

    We can see from Wu Han's confession that what he "opposed in writing, verbally, and even in action" was not the Kuomintang reactionaries, but our Communist Party and the broad masses of revolutionary people under the leadership of our party; what he "sympathized with" and "cared about" at that time was not the revolution, but the Jiang bandit gang that was "setting in the west and dying"!

    (IV) Under the pretext of "supporting the rural cultural revolution," he attempted to undermine the enthusiasm of workers, peasants, and soldiers in studying Chairman Mao's works in the name of donating books.

    For more than a decade since liberation, Wu Han has said some things in meetings, in newspapers, and in articles about "working hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought," which sounded grand and beautiful, but what were his actual actions? Let's see how he "supported the rural cultural revolution" and treated the activities of workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works in the spring of 1965.

    In the spring of 1965, a mass upsurge of studying Chairman Mao's works was set off in the rural areas of our province. The Kuzhutang Brigade set up a club, which was an important base for studying and publicizing Mao Zedong Thought. Comrades of this brigade working in other places sent books to the club one after another. Some sent Chairman Mao's works, some sent Lei Feng's Diary, and some sent A Necessary Lesson. At this time, Wu Han also reversed his past cold attitude towards the masses in his hometown and suddenly became enthusiastic, sending more than 100 books to the club. What kind of books were they? Most of them were about emperors, generals, and ministers! Tang Taizong and Yuan Shikai came, Li Hongzhang and Liang Qichao came, Hai Rui and Yu Qian also came, and there were also a batch of "historical tales" of this and that, but there was not a single book of Chairman Mao's works that everyone urgently needed. The villagers were extremely indignant about this. They said, "Wu Han is doing this to openly oppose us peasants from reading Chairman Mao's books and listening to Chairman Mao's words; he wants us to read Wu Han's books and listen to the words of emperors, generals, and ministers!"

    In this investigation, we conducted a rough analysis of this batch of books.

    All of these one hundred or so books were edited by Wu Han. These books can be roughly divided into two categories: one category is mainly about historical figures, and the other category is mainly about "historical knowledge." What kind of stuff did Wu Han try to sell to the poor and lower-middle peasants and villagers in his hometown through this batch of books?

    (1) In the name of "popularizing historical knowledge," he advocated novelty and imitating the past.

    Now, let's first take a look at what kind of "historical knowledge" Wu Han edited and introduced in this batch of books.

    Please see The History of the Imperial Examination System. This book spent more than 25,000 words, introducing in detail what "the creation of the imperial examination system in the Sui and Tang dynasties," what "the development of the imperial examination system in the Song and Yuan dynasties," what "the peak of the imperial examination system in the Ming and Qing dynasties," and so on. It vigorously promoted that the imperial examination system was "the ladder to enter the officialdom" and "the best way to obtain high official positions, generous salaries, authority, and power." It promoted how the ancients took the imperial examination and, after becoming jinshi (successful candidate in the highest imperial examination), participated in the "Tanhua Banquet" with "respect and glory"; and how they collectively inscribed their names as a souvenir after the banquet. It promoted how the imperial examination system was "enthusiastically supported" by people at that time.

    Please see Nanjing History. In this book, Wu Han and his group introduced the "earliest city of Nanjing" more than 2,000 years ago, the city of Nanjing in the "Six Dynasties," the "Nanjing in the Tang and Song dynasties," and the "Nanjing in the Ming Dynasty" with great interest. They vigorously promoted the "grandeur" and "magnificence" of the palaces and mausoleums of emperors of all dynasties, how "precious" the jade pieces, pottery figurines, and other funerary objects were, how "prosperous" the city was, and how "flourishing" industry and commerce were. However, they avoided talking about the heinous crimes committed by the Kuomintang reactionaries in Nanjing in those years; and they only said two general sentences about the profound and tremendous changes in all aspects in the past decade or so since liberation.

    Please see General Knowledge of Chinese History. This set of books has been published in eight volumes, with more than 400,000 words. Among them, several volumes mainly introduce "How did ancient Chinese people dress and dress up?" "What kind of furniture did ancient Chinese people use?" Some also introduce how ancient Chinese people kneeled and bowed. Wu Han talked more enthusiastically and bizarrely than others in his article "What is the origin of the kneeling and bowing etiquette of ancient China?" He introduced in detail how "the prime ministers of the Qing Dynasty kneeled when talking to the emperor and empress dowager"; some "old senior officials" could not bear kneeling for a long time, so they added something to the middle of their pants to pad them; he introduced how he "discovered" through research that ordinary people in ancient times "sometimes had to kneel," and so on.

    Obviously, Wu Han's launching of such a set of black goods when an unprecedented mass upsurge of studying Chairman Mao's works appeared in the vast rural areas was with ulterior motives. He was by no means to "popularize" any "historical knowledge," but to promote hunting for "novelty" and imitating the "past," to lure the broad masses away from the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, away from class struggle, and to follow their "Three-Family Village" gang to engage in sinister activities against the party and socialism.

    (2) Publicizing emperors, generals, and ministers, and carrying out anti-Party activities

    Of the more than one hundred books sent back by Wu Han, more than forty were about historical figures. What kind of stuff was this?

    The objects of praise in these books were almost all emperors, generals, and ministers. They said that the big landlord leader, Tang Taizong Li Shimin, was an "outstanding military strategist and statesman." They said that Wu Zetian, whose hands were stained with the blood of the working people, was a "good emperor." They said that Kou Zhun, a poor boy from the Song Dynasty, became a jinshi at the age of nineteen and a "county magistrate" at the age of twenty due to "studying hard" and personal struggle, and eventually climbed to the high position of prime minister. Wu Han touted these rulers of feudal dynasties as "models for our later scholars." In particular, Wu Han openly took his "carefully" made major poisonous weeds, The Story of Hai Rui and Yu Qian, to his hometown to promote them. These poisonous weeds of his aroused strong opposition among the masses of the Kuzhutang Brigade. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and young militiamen unanimously pointed out that Wu Han's "sending books" was a conspiracy. Some said, "When we are studying Chairman Mao's works and learning from Lei Feng, Wu Han sent us The Story of Hai Rui, asking us to learn Hai Rui's spirit of 'scolding the emperor.' This is to oppose the Party Central Committee, oppose Chairman Mao, and oppose us poor and lower-middle peasants ourselves. This is absolutely impossible!" Some said, "Wu Han sent 'Hai Rui' and 'Yu Qian' to the countryside to occupy the cultural front, wanting to use feudal ideology and bourgeois ideology to confuse the minds of our poor and lower-middle peasants, and to trick us into taking the capitalist road. This is wishful thinking, and we will never be fooled!" These vivid facts show that Wu Han's sending books was by no means to "support the rural cultural revolution," but to poison the masses and compete with our party for ideological positions and leadership! The masses of the Kuzhutang Brigade have bright eyes and completely exposed Wu Han's conspiracy. Now, the enthusiasm of the cadres and masses of the entire brigade in studying Chairman Mao's works is even greater.

    揭露吴晗的反革命真面目
    ——吴晗家乡义乌县吴店公社调查材料（续篇）
    齐力  孟进
    （三）早在三十年代，吴晗就死心塌地投靠胡适、蒋廷黻等反动头子，充当国民党反动派的走卒
    吴晗自吹：他早在“一九三○年以来”就“无条件地接受了历史唯物论”，就已经“同情”、“关切”和“向往”革命，“从文字，从口头，以至用行动来反对”国民党反动派。
    真相究竟如何？
    在这次调查中，我们收集到一批信件。这批信件，是吴晗在一九三一年到一九三二年间，亲笔写给他小学时代的老师、地方绅士杨志冰（义乌吴店人）的。在这批信件里，吴晗踌躇满志地道出了他当年的政治立场和政治态度。
    （一）胡适的“得意门生”，美国奴才的奴才
    一九三一年八月八日，吴晗给杨志冰的信中说：
    “生本届投考北大清华二校，一摈一取。……在清大校内，谋事极为不易，……现由顾、胡（适）诸人设法，并允为筹一长计……猷记月前往晤适之师时，……曾询生以需钱用否，如欲钱用，彼言时，即手取钱袋，欲以相授。”“诸师予我以精神上之鼓励者已极多。”（注：引文中的标点是调查者加的，下同。）
    一九三一年八月二十七日的信中说：
    “入学事，近大有进展，可以无虑。前日往见适之先生，云已耑函清大校长翁文灏、文学院长冯友兰及史学主任蒋廷黻诸先生，并生所撰之胡应麟年谱送交清大，嘱为生在清大觅一位置，已得答复，允为在史学系找一工作，名义为助教或其他未定，工作为整理大内档案，报酬至少可维持生活云云。适之师又恐生钱不够用，另借四十元为入学后购书之费，并嘱安心入学，一切事渠可设法。盛意深情令生愧怍无地。”
    在同一封信中，吴晗还说：
    “乃天下事无独有偶。在燕大方面，史学系教授顾颉刚，国文系主任马鉴，图书馆委员长洪煨莲闻此讯后，又语生以渠等已为生设法，在哈佛燕京社（吴晗自注：哈佛燕京社，为美国哈佛大学与中国燕京大学合组之文化机关）找一位置。现时虽未定（因此社须在十月中开会，此事须在会中决定也），然可决其必成。倘即不成（渠等即主持此社者，万无不成），渠等集腋成裘，亦可傅（敷）衍过去，亦嘱以安心入学，万事有渠等在，决无问题。如有所需，尽可启齿，不必见外云云。并劝以明年转学燕京，一切手续均可代办。言下似有不满生之不考燕京而入清华，及入清华事由适之师独为布置之意。”
    一九三一年九月九日的信中说：
    “九日晨晤教务长张子高先生及史学系主任蒋廷黻先生，俱以胡师曾函托关照，对生甚为青目。关于工读事，蒋氏已定于下周开教务会议时以史学系名义提出通过，此不过手续关系，其实毫无问题。”
    请看，吴晗这个自诩早在一九三○年就对国民党“从没有存过幻想”的“历史唯物论者”，开口“胡师”，闭口“胡师”，与胡适、蒋廷黻等美帝国主义奴才相处得多么热火！他们之间，一个“函托关照”，一个受宠若惊；一个赐舍小惠，一个“愧怍无地”。吴晗在胡适面前，一副奴才相！
    其实，吴晗对于当胡适的奴才是不满足的。不是吗？他对于进入哈佛燕京社这个美国主子主办的所谓文化机构，垂涎三尺，积极钻营，不是不想当洋奴，而是争着当洋奴。到了一九四六年一月，在吴晗和潘光旦、费孝通等人联名致美国总统特使马歇尔的信上，他的洋奴本性，就彻底地暴露出来了。
    （二）埋头“整理国故”，并且学着主子的腔调，攻击和污蔑抗日救亡运动
    “九一八”事变前后，全国各地，抗日救亡运动风起云涌。这个时候，吴晗在干些什么？
    一九三一年九月九日，吴晗给杨志冰的信中说：
    “三年内，已定耑攻明史。秦汉史则以积习已深，暇中猷复不能忘情。然已降作附庸。……唯所用明史，系内图书馆借来，非己所有。遇有关键及自己有新解释处，不能一一为作眉批夹注，依人作嫁，终非自备一部不可！”
    不久，吴晗在另一信中又说：
    “近日检得明史一帧，朝夕讽诵。他又得钱大昕潜研堂全集一部，内弇州山人年谱一卷，已由曦弟分年录帙，以其叙事过简，及于其学术思想渊源，造就之未及也。置四部稿及玉剑尊闻、弇山堂集、太仓志及当时人文集于案头，随所得，补隶疏正于下，预计一月后，当可补订成一初稿，稍加厘正，便可成书。他日有暇，更拟合杨升庵、焦弱侯、胡元瑞三谱而一之，成明正嘉隆万学术年谱，亦一大快也。”
    一九三一年年底，国民党反动派的卖国投降政策，进一步引起全国人民的不满，华北地区的青年学生，在我党的领导下纷纷组织请愿团，南下赴京请愿，要求奋起抗日。这个时候，吴晗又在干些什么呢？当年十二月二十七日，他给杨志冰的信中说：
    “本校同学，……日前组织赴京请愿团，已于二十二日南下，今日抵京。生以特种关系，留校服务。”
    吴晗留在校里安全吗？他在信中告诉杨志冰说：
    “南中对此间事，或有种种谣啄（诼），均不足置信。且军警防范极严，亦断无意外也。”
    一九三二年一月，全国的抗日反蒋运动进入高潮。当时吴晗的心境又是如何？他在当年“一二八”事变前三天，给杨志冰写信说：
    “平中比来，受外内种种堪为痛哭之恶现象所困，凡事都无生气。……世风日下，读书人只知读性史及海上无聊作家之黑幕小说，高文典册，久已如吴稚辉所言，置之粪厕中。一般维新人物，已不知有汉唐宋元，遑论周秦，世运如此，亦复何言！”
    看，在伟大的抗日救亡运动中，吴晗的所作所为，同广大人民、广大爱国青年学生是多么格格不入！“九一八”事变前后，广大爱国青年积极投入抗日救亡运动；而吴晗，却成天躲在古书堆里，捧着明史，“朝夕讽诵”，“眉批夹注”，搞什么“整理国故”、“读书救国”。后来，随着抗日救亡运动的深入发展，华北学生纷纷南下请愿；而吴晗，却留在学校里发牢骚，说什么抗日救亡运动“破坏”了他的安静的读书环境，“恨甚”。“一二八”事变发生后，全国反蒋救亡运动进入高潮，抗日斗争出现一派大好形势；而吴晗，却咬牙切齿地攻击和污蔑当时轰轰烈烈的抗日反蒋运动是“恶现象”，说什么当时的形势是“世风日下”，“凡事都无生气”。那时候，大批知识青年在我们党的引导下，从古书堆里跳出来，积极投入抗日救亡运动。吴晗对此深为不满，攻击这些革命青年是“不知有汉唐宋元，遑论周秦”的“一般维新分子”。吴晗的这些话，同胡适之流的反动言论，如出一辙！
    我们从吴晗的自白中可以看出：他“从文字，从口头，以至用行动来反对”的，不是国民党反动派，而是我们共产党和我党领导下的广大革命人民；他当时“同情”和“关切”的，不是革命，而是那“日薄西山，气息奄奄”的蒋匪帮！
    （四）借口“支持农村文化革命”，以赠书为名，妄图破坏工农兵群众学习毛主席著作的热潮
    解放十几年来，吴晗在大会上，报纸上，文章里，曾说了一些“努力学习马列主义、毛泽东思想”的话，听起来冠冕堂皇，非常漂亮，可是他的实际行动又是怎样？请看一九六五年春天，他是怎样“支持农村文化革命”，怎样对待工农兵群众学习毛主席著作的活动的。
    一九六五年春天，本省农村掀起了大学毛主席著作的群众性热潮。苦竹塘大队办起了俱乐部，这是一个学习和宣传毛泽东思想的重要阵地。这个大队在外地工作的同志，纷纷给俱乐部寄书。有的寄来了毛主席著作，有的寄来了《雷锋日记》，有的寄来了《必要的一课》。就在这个时候，吴晗也一反过去对家乡群众的冷漠旧态，忽然热心起来，给俱乐部寄来了一百多本图书。你道是些什么书呢？大都是关于帝王将相的书！《唐太宗》、《袁世凯》来了，《李鸿章》、《梁启超》来了，《海瑞》、《于谦》也来了，此外，还有一批这样那样的“史话”，可就是没有一本大家迫切需要的毛主席著作。社员对此极为愤慨。他们说：“吴晗这样做，是公开反对我们农民读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话；要我们读吴晗他们的书，听帝王将相的话！”
    在这次调查中，我们对这批书进行了一次粗略的剖析。
    这一百多本书，都是吴晗主编的。这些书，大体上可以分为两类：一类是以介绍历史人物为主要内容的，另一类是以介绍“历史知识”为主要内容的。吴晗通过这批图书，企图向家乡的贫下中农和社员贩卖些什么货色呢？
    （一）以“普及历史知识”为名，提倡猎奇、摹古
    现在，我们先来看看吴晗主编的这批书，向人们介绍了一些什么样的“历史知识”。
    请看《科举制度史话》。这本书，花了两万五千多字，不厌其烦地向人们介绍了什么“隋唐科举制度的创立”，什么“宋元科举制度的发展”，什么“明清科举制度的极盛”，等等。大肆宣扬科举制度是“进入官场的阶梯”，是“取得高官厚禄权威势力的最好门路”。宣扬古人考中进士以后，如何带着“尊崇和光荣”参加“探花宴”；宴会以后，如何集体题名留念。宣扬科举制度在当时如何受到人们的“热烈拥护”。
    请看《南京史话》。在这本书里，吴晗他们以莫大的兴致介绍了二千多年前的“最早的南京城”，“六朝”的南京城，“唐宋时代的南京”，“明代的南京”等等。大肆宣扬历代帝王宫殿、陵墓的“宏伟”、“华丽”，玉片、陶俑等殉葬品如何“珍贵”，市容如何“繁华”，工商业如何“兴盛”。然而，对国民党反动派当年在南京犯下的滔天罪行，却避而不谈；对解放后十几年来各方面的深刻的巨大的变化，只笼统地说了两句话。
    请看《中国历史常识》。这套书，已出八册，洋洋四十多万言。其中有几册，大事介绍的，是“我国古代人怎样穿衣打扮？”
  “我国古代人使用什么样的家具？”还有的是介绍我国古代人怎么跪、怎么拜。吴晗在《我国古代跪、拜礼节的由来是怎样的？》一文中，谈得比其他人更加津津有味，更加离奇古怪。他不厌其烦地介绍什么“清朝的宰相们和皇帝、皇太后谈话时”是怎么跪的；有些“年老的大官”跪久了吃不消，怎样在裤子中间加衬一些东西垫着；介绍他经过考证，怎样“发现”古代的老百姓“有时也要跪”，等等。
    显然，吴晗在广大农村出现空前未有的群众性学习毛主席著作热潮的时候，抛出这样一套黑货，是别有用心的。他绝不是为了“普及”什么“历史知识”，而是为了提倡猎“奇”、摹“古”，诱骗广大群众脱离毛泽东思想的引导，脱离阶级斗争，跟着他们“三家村”黑帮一起，去发思古之幽情，从事反党反社会主义的阴谋活动。
    （二）宣扬帝王将相，进行反党活动
    吴晗寄回的一百多本图书中，有四十多本是介绍历史人物的。这又是些什么货色？
    这些书的歌颂对象，几乎都是帝王将相。说什么大地主头子、唐太宗李世民，是一个“杰出的军事家和政治家”。说什么双手沾满劳动人民鲜血的武则天，是个“好皇帝”。说什么宋朝穷小子寇准，由于“读书用功”、个人奋斗，十九岁中了进士，二十岁当了“知县”，最后居然爬上了宰相的高位。吴晗把这些封建王朝的统治者，吹嘘成为“我们后学的典范”。特别是吴晗把自己“精心”制作的大毒草《海瑞的故事》和《于谦》，也公然拿到家乡去推销。他的这些毒草，在苦竹塘大队的群众中引起了强烈的反对。广大贫下中农、青年民兵一致指出：吴晗“送书”，是个阴谋。有的说：“我们学习毛主席著作，学习雷锋，学得正起劲的时候，吴晗却给我们送来了《海瑞的故事》，要我们学习海瑞的‘骂皇帝’精神，这就是要我们反对党中央，反对毛主席，反对我们贫下中农自己。这绝对办不到！”有的说：“吴晗派‘海瑞’、‘于谦’到农村来占领文化阵地，是想用封建思想、资产阶级思想来迷住我们贫下中农的心窍，骗我们去走资本主义道路，这是痴心妄想，我们决不上当！”这些活生生的事实说明，吴晗送书，决不是为了“支持农村文化革命”，而是为了毒害群众，与我党争夺思想阵地，争夺领导权！苦竹塘大队的群众，眼睛雪亮，彻底揭穿了吴晗的阴谋。现在，全大队干部和群众学习毛主席著作的劲头更大了。（原载五月二十一日《浙江日报》，本文第一、二部分见五月二十日本报）
