    Daily Reading of Chairman Mao's Quotations
    Chen Fengzhu, Jin Li, Yangzhou Pesticide Factory
	Walking the streets and passing through the lanes, every street and lane is filled with the beautiful spring scenery, Chairman Mao's quotations are written all over the walls, their golden light shining brightly in our hearts. Walking the streets wider, passing the lanes brighter, looking at the days clearer, hoping the roads broader, the entire city cheers for the red sun! Thousands of flowers bloom towards the sun, the revolutionary people wholeheartedly towards the Party, reading Chairman Mao's quotations every day, remembering every word and sentence in our hearts. Strength surges in our bodies, songs sing in our hearts, shouldering heavy burdens to serve the people, greatly promoting the "Foolish Old Man" spirit, charging forward on the revolutionary path! Charging forward against the wind, forging ahead with high fighting spirit, daring to struggle and daring to win victory, sweeping away all the monsters and demons. Seeing the storms raging across the five continents, embracing the clouds and waves of the four seas, raising the red flag high, beating the war drums loud, the revolutionary momentum is unstoppable! Walking the streets and passing through the lanes, the green willows are full of beautiful spring scenery, Chairman Mao's quotations are written all over the walls, the ancient city is seething with heat everywhere. Every road has a pointer, everyone has the sun in their hearts, the streets are wider and the lanes are brighter, the sky is clearer and the roads are broader, Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly!

    毛主席语录天天读
    扬州农药厂　陈丰祝　金力走大街呀过小巷，街街巷巷好春光，毛主席语录写满墙，金光闪闪照心上。走街街更宽呵，过巷巷更亮，看天天更朗呵，望路路更广，倾城欢呼红太阳！万丛花呀朝阳放，革命人民心向党，毛主席语录天天读，一字一句记心上。力在身上涌呵，歌在心里唱，为人民服务挑重担，“愚公”精神大发扬，革命道上往前闯！往前闯呀顶风上，披荆斩棘斗志昂，敢于斗争敢胜利，牛鬼蛇神全扫光。眼看五洲风雷激，胸怀四海云和浪，红旗举得高呵，战鼓擂得响，革命气势不可挡！走大街呀过小巷，绿杨一片好春光，毛主席语录写满墙，古城到处滚热浪。条条道上有指针，人人心中有太阳，街更宽呵巷更亮，天更晴朗路更广，毛泽东思想光万丈！
