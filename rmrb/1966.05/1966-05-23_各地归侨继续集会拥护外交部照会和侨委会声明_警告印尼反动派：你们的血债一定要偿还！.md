    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd -- Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese residing in various places continue to hold rallies, angrily denouncing the crimes of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in their frantic persecution of Overseas Chinese. They expressed their firm support for the note from the Chinese Foreign Ministry to the Indonesian Embassy in China on May 18th and the statement from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and demanded that the Indonesian government promptly provide a satisfactory response to the Chinese Foreign Ministry's note.
    In Guangzhou, many Overseas Chinese students, Overseas Chinese residents, and relatives of Overseas Chinese who returned from Indonesia held rallies separately on the 21st. At the rally held at Jinan University, Yang Fangchun, a student in the Physics Department, said: "The Indonesian reactionaries' bloody atrocities against Overseas Chinese are inhuman. Last December, they organized a group of thugs to ravage and massacre Overseas Chinese in Lombok and other places. They killed anyone they saw, robbed everything they could find, and burned down houses. On the same day that Overseas Chinese Wu Yudian's pregnant wife and six children were brutally burned alive by thugs, my house was also burned. Although my mother and six younger siblings escaped the fire, our family's life was completely ruined. The blood debts owed by the Indonesian reactionary forces for their anti-China and anti-Overseas Chinese activities must be repaid." Wu Jiayao, a student in the History Department, said that his older brother had been arrested by the Indonesian right wing, his younger brother was missing, and his mother in her sixties had no means of support. He said: "The Indonesian reactionaries think that by opposing China and persecuting Overseas Chinese, they can overwhelm Overseas Chinese and the Chinese people. You are wrong. Patriotic Overseas Chinese cannot be intimidated, and the Chinese people cannot be intimidated. Your bloody massacres will only make the people of the world more aware of your reactionary faces, and you will eventually suffer the consequences of your own evil deeds." Xie Kengchang, an Economics Department student who returned from Indonesia in 1964, said: "In 1960, when Overseas Chinese persecuted by the Indonesian reactionaries were taking the motherland's ships back home, countless Indonesian friends saw them off at the docks. With tears in their eyes, they said: 'It is not we who drove you away. Although you are forced to leave Indonesia, we are still connected heart to heart, and we will always be friends!' The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces' absurd claim that opposing China and persecuting Overseas Chinese is a 'reaction of the angry masses' is a great insult to the Indonesian people! The traditional friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people can never be destroyed by a handful of Indonesian reactionaries."
    In various Overseas Chinese farms in Guangdong Province, returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives have held rallies in recent days. More than 3,000 returned Overseas Chinese in the Lufeng Overseas Chinese Farm were all refugees who returned in 1960 and 1961 when the Indonesian reactionary forces rampantly persecuted Overseas Chinese. They were extremely angry at the atrocities committed by Indonesian right-wing thugs in murdering and persecuting Overseas Chinese. At the rally held at the farm on the 19th, returned Overseas Chinese solemnly warned the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces: The Overseas Chinese of socialist China cannot be bullied, and the blood debts you owe will be repaid one day. At the rally held by employees of the Yangchun Forest Farm on the 19th, Chen Chenghao, an old carpenter and advanced producer at the forest farm, said that he had been a carpenter in Indonesia for more than 30 years, shedding blood and sweat and living a poor life. After he lost his job in 1959, his family's life was in dire straits. After returning to the motherland in 1960, his family of eighteen lived a good life, the children went to school, and the adults participated in work. This shows that the powerful motherland is the real backing of Overseas Chinese.
    In the main Overseas Chinese hometowns of Fujian Province, such as Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Fuqing, Longhai, Yongchun, Nan'an, Jinjiang, and Longyan counties and cities, returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives have held rallies in recent days. Some newly returned Indonesian Overseas Chinese used their own firsthand experiences at the rallies to accuse the Indonesian right-wing thugs of beating, robbing, kidnapping, and massacring innocent Overseas Chinese. Many family members of Indonesian Overseas Chinese victims also angrily exposed the facts that their relatives were brutally persecuted by Indonesian right-wing thugs. At the rally held by returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives in Xiamen City, Dong Yuemei, a student at the Jimei Overseas Chinese Students' Middle School Remedial School, accused that her family lived in Situbondo, East Java, Indonesia, and had always complied with Indonesian government laws and regulations. Not long ago, a group of thugs suddenly broke into her house, first stabbed her mother, then took her father to a bridge and killed him, and threw his body into the river. Another group of thugs robbed all of her family's belongings. Yan Xiyue, chairman of the Xiamen City Overseas Chinese Federation and returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia, Fu Weidan, chairman of the Jinjiang Special District Overseas Chinese Federation, Gao Zhirong, chairman of the Minhou Special District Overseas Chinese Federation, and Lin Kaide, chairman of the Zhangzhou City Overseas Chinese Federation, all participated in the local rallies held by returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives. At the rallies, they solemnly warned the Indonesian government that the Chinese government and the Chinese people would never ignore your brutal persecution of Overseas Chinese. They also expressed their willingness to make every effort to prepare for receiving Overseas Chinese and warmly welcomed the early return of the affected Overseas Chinese.
    Many Indonesian returned Overseas Chinese pointed out in their speeches that the anti-China and anti-Overseas Chinese movement in Indonesia was only initiated by a handful of right-wing reactionary forces who were enemies of the Indonesian people, and the vast majority of Indonesian people wanted to continue to be friendly with the Chinese people. Fang Yuhe, a driver at the Zhangzhou Transportation General Station and returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said: "When the Japanese fascists occupied Indonesia, many Overseas Chinese and Indonesian people fought side by side, shedding blood and sacrificing themselves to strike at the invaders. Overseas Chinese car drivers actively transported munitions for the Indonesian anti-Japanese guerrillas, and some even gave their precious lives." He pointed out that the contribution of Overseas Chinese to the Indonesian revolution cannot be erased by a handful of Indonesian reactionaries.
    Wei Ke, a deputy to the National People's Congress and acting president of Huaqiao University, expressed his complete support for the Foreign Ministry's note and the statement of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission at a rally held by teachers and students of Huaqiao University on the 20th. He said that since October of last year, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, while frantically opposing communism and opposing the people, have instigated and organized thugs to carry out inhumane persecution of Overseas Chinese, arousing the public anger of the Chinese people and the righteous people of the world. The Chinese government has lodged many protests to the Indonesian government, but the Indonesian government has not only failed to stop the anti-Chinese atrocities, but has instead intensified its persecution of Overseas Chinese, and even attempted to deny its crimes and slanderously accuse others. We express our great indignation at this. He demanded that the Indonesian government must immediately stop the atrocities of persecuting Overseas Chinese and promptly give a satisfactory reply to the note from the Chinese Foreign Ministry. At the meeting, some family members of victimized Overseas Chinese angrily accused the Indonesian right-wing thugs of the fascist atrocities of persecuting their relatives. A returned Overseas Chinese student named Hong from the Department of Chemical Engineering in the second grade accused that her family had lived in a fishing port in Sumatra for generations, and had always relied on fishing for a living. On January 24 this year, Indonesian reactionary soldiers robbed her family of their only fishing boat, leaving her family of seven with no means of support. Her father became ill from worry and died soon after. Currently, she is left with her mother and five younger siblings, with no one to rely on. She said that many Overseas Chinese in the area made a living by fishing, braving the wind and rain all year round, and had contributed to the prosperity of the local economy and the satisfaction of the daily needs of the local people, but now they were being brutally persecuted. I want to ask the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces: What crime did my father commit, what law did he violate?
    At a rally held by returned Overseas Chinese in Shenyang City on the 21st, Zhang Kewei, director of the Liaoning Provincial Overseas Chinese Federation Preparatory Committee, and deputy directors Yan Lusha and Zhang Yuming strongly condemned the crimes of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in colluding with US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to persecute Overseas Chinese. Many Indonesian returned Overseas Chinese accused at the meeting of the experiences of their relatives being persecuted by Indonesian right-wing thugs. Tang Wanying, a teacher at Shenyang No. 4 Middle School, angrily accused that Indonesian right-wing thugs killed her father and set fire to her house, and the whereabouts of her mother, brother, and sister are still unknown. Her accusation aroused great anger among the returned Overseas Chinese present at the meeting. Returned Overseas Chinese in Lushun-Dalian also held a rally on the 20th. At the meeting, the returned Overseas Chinese expressed great indignation at the crimes of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in frantically persecuting Overseas Chinese.

    各地归侨继续集会拥护外交部照会和侨委会声明
    警告印尼反动派：你们的血债一定要偿还！
    新华社二十二日讯　各地的归国华侨和华侨眷属继续举行集会，愤怒声讨印度尼西亚右派反动势力疯狂迫害华侨的罪行。他们表示坚决拥护我国外交部五月十八日致印度尼西亚驻华大使馆的照会和华侨事务委员会的声明，并且要求印度尼西亚政府迅速对我国外交部的照会作出圆满的答复。
    广州市许多从印度尼西亚归来的华侨学生和归侨居民、侨眷，二十一日分别举行了集会。在暨南大学举行的集会上，物理系学生杨坊春说：“印度尼西亚反动派对华侨的血腥暴行是灭绝人性的。去年十二月里，他们组织了一批暴徒到龙目岛各地蹂躏和残杀华侨，他们见人就杀，见物就抢，见房子就烧。就在华侨吴玉殿的怀孕妻子和六个孩子惨遭暴徒活活烧死的同一天，我家也被烧了，母亲和六个弟妹虽然从大火中逃了出来，一家人生活却完全陷于绝境。印度尼西亚反动势力反华排华所欠下的血债，是一定要偿还的。”历史系学生吴家耀说，他的哥哥遭到印度尼西亚右派的逮捕，弟弟下落不明，六十多岁的母亲生活无着。他说：“印度尼西亚反动派以为这样反华排华可以把华侨和中国人民压倒。你们想错了，爱国华侨是吓不倒的，中国人民是吓不倒的，你们的血腥屠杀，只能使世界人民更加认清你们的反动面目，最后必将自食其恶果。”一九六四年才从印度尼西亚回国的经济系学生谢铿昌说：“一九六○年受印度尼西亚反动派迫害的华侨坐祖国的接侨船回国时，无数印度尼西亚朋友送到码头。他们含着热泪说：‘不是我们把你们赶走的，你们虽然被迫离开了印度尼西亚，可是我们仍然心连着心，我们永远是友好的！’印度尼西亚右派反动势力胡说反华排华是什么‘愤怒的人民大众的反应’，这是对印度尼西亚人民的莫大侮辱！中国人民和印度尼西亚人民的传统友谊，决不是印度尼西亚一小撮反动派所破坏得了的。”
    广东省各地华侨农场的归侨和侨眷连日来分别举行了集会。陆丰华侨农场的三千多名归侨，都是一九六○、一九六一年印度尼西亚反动势力猖狂排华时受迫害回国的难侨。他们对印度尼西亚右派暴徒残杀、迫害华侨的暴行极为愤怒。在农场十九日举行的集会上，归侨们严正警告印度尼西亚右派反动势力：社会主义中国的侨民是不可欺负的，你们欠下的血债必有偿还的一天。在阳春林场职工十九日举行的集会上，老木工、林场先进生产者陈成好说，他在印度尼西亚当了三十多年木工，流尽了血汗，过着贫困的生活，一九五九年他失业后，全家生活陷于绝境，一九六○年回到祖国以后，一家十八口生活过得很好，小孩子都上学念书，成年的都参加了工作。这说明强大的祖国是华侨真正的靠山。
    福建省主要侨乡厦门、漳州、泉州、福清、龙海、永春、南安、晋江和龙岩等县、市的归侨、侨眷连日来分别举行了集会。一些新近回国的印度尼西亚归侨，在各地的集会上用自己眼见身受的事实，控诉了印度尼西亚右派暴徒殴打、抢劫、绑架、屠杀无辜华侨的滔天罪行。许多印度尼西亚受害华侨的家属，也愤怒地揭露了他们的亲人遭到印度尼西亚右派暴徒残酷迫害的事实。在厦门市归侨、侨眷举行的集会上，集美归国华侨学生中等补习学校学生董月美控诉说，她家住在印度尼西亚东爪哇西都文罗，全家一贯遵守印度尼西亚政府法令。不久前一批暴徒突然闯进她家里，先刺伤了她的母亲，然后把她父亲带到一座大桥下杀害了，并且把尸体扔到河里，另一群暴徒又抢走了她全家的东西。厦门市归侨联合会主席、印度尼西亚归侨颜西岳，晋江专区归侨联合会主席傅维丹、闽侯专区归侨联合会主席高至荣、漳州市归侨联合会主席林开德等都分别参加了当地归侨、侨眷举行的集会，他们在会上严正警告印度尼西亚政府：中国政府和中国人民对你们残酷迫害华侨的暴行决不会置之不顾。他们并表示要努力做好一切接侨的准备工作，热烈欢迎受害侨胞早日归来。
    许多印度尼西亚归侨在发言中指出，印度尼西亚的反华排华运动只是一小撮与印度尼西亚人民为敌的右派反动势力搞起来的，广大印度尼西亚人民是要和中国人民友好下去的。漳州运输总站汽车驾驶员、印度尼西亚归侨方玉和说：“在日本法西斯占据印度尼西亚的时候，许多华侨和印度尼西亚人民并肩作战，流血牺牲，打击了侵略者。华侨汽车驾驶员就积极为印度尼西亚抗日游击队运送军火，有的还献出了宝贵的生命。”他指出，华侨对印度尼西亚革命的贡献是一小撮印度尼西亚反动派所抹煞不了的。
    全国人民代表大会代表、华侨大学代校长韦慤二十日在华侨大学师生举行的集会上，表示完全拥护外交部的照会和华侨事务委员会的声明。他说，去年十月以来，印度尼西亚右派反动势力在猖狂地反共反人民的同时，策动和组织暴徒对华侨进行了惨无人道的迫害，激起了我国人民和全世界正义人民的公愤。我国政府曾向印度尼西亚政府提出了多次抗议照会，印度尼西亚政府不但没有制止排华暴行，反而变本加厉地迫害华侨，甚至妄图抵赖罪责，含血喷人。我们对此表示极大愤慨。他要求印度尼西亚政府，必须立即停止迫害华侨的暴行，并对我国外交部的照会迅速作出圆满的答复。会上，一些受害华侨的家属愤怒控诉了印度尼西亚右派暴徒迫害他们亲人的法西斯暴行。化工系二年级一个姓洪的归侨学生控诉说，她家几代侨居苏门答腊一个渔港，一向依靠捕鱼为生，今年一月二十四日，印度尼西亚反动军人抢走了她家仅有的一条渔船，使她全家七口生计无着，她父亲因此忧急成病，不久就死去。目前留下她母亲和五个弟妹，生活无依无靠。她说，当地有许多华侨以捕鱼为生，终年风里来雨里去，对繁荣当地经济和满足当地人民日常生活的需要做出了贡献，而现在却惨遭迫害。我要质问印度尼西亚右派反动势力：我父亲犯了什么罪，犯了什么法。
    在沈阳市归国华侨二十一日举行的集会上，辽宁省侨联筹委会主任委员张克威、副主任委员晏璐莎、张育明等强烈谴责印度尼西亚右派反动势力勾结美帝国主义和蒋匪帮迫害华侨的罪行。许多印度尼西亚归侨，在会上控诉了他们的亲人受到印度尼西亚右派暴徒迫害的经过。沈阳第四中学教师唐婉英愤怒地控诉了印度尼西亚右派暴徒杀害了她的父亲，又放火烧了她的家，她的母亲、哥哥、妹妹至今下落不明。她的控诉激起了到会归侨的极大愤怒。在旅大的归国华侨也在二十日举行了集会。归侨们在会上对印度尼西亚右派反动势力疯狂迫害华侨的罪行表示极大的愤慨。
