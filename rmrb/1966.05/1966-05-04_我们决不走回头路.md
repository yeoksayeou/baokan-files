    Wu Han curses our Party and praises the old society to the skies. Let us open the history of suffering of our poor and lower-middle peasants, compare them, and we will know for whom Wu Han writes his articles and what he writes about!
    In the old society, we suffered all kinds of hardships. Only when the Communist Party came did we stand up. We love the Party, but Wu Han opposes the Party and sings a different tune. The Party says, "The People's Commune is good," but Wu Han says, "Returning the land to the peasants will bring peace and stability," and "Seizing the land will not last long." Wu Han is determined to dismantle the socialist stage. Chairman Mao taught us the six criteria for distinguishing fragrant flowers from poisonous weeds, of which "the most important are the socialist road and the leadership of the Party." The spearhead of Wu Han's "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is aimed directly at the Party and socialism.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This question is the primary question of the revolution." Wu Han not only helps the right-leaning opportunists a great deal, but also helps all kinds of monsters and demons, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. Wu Han said that his writing about historical figures was for "serving the present," but in reality, it was used to oppose the Party and socialism. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, resolutely oppose this. Who agrees? Only that small handful of monsters and demons.
    We are determined not to retrace our steps. Look at the crimes suffered by the poor and lower-middle peasants in the old society! Poor peasant commune member Dong Yongmiao borrowed one stone and two dou of grain at usurious interest before liberation. Later, he sold his thirteen-year-old sister and repaid ten stones and eight dou, ten jin of cotton, and five yuan. However, the usurer, in 1961, demanded the old debt from Dong Yongmiao again. Dong Yongmiao said, "I only borrowed a little over one stone of grain from you, but I have repaid you more than ten stones of grain, and I have also given you cotton and money. Calculate how many times the repayment exceeds the loan." The usurer said, "Do you know how I calculate my accounts? This is called 'the donkey rolls,' the interest is endless, and the principal has not been calculated yet." Look! How vicious the usurers are! Who does Wu Han write "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" for? Isn't it for these people?
    We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, are very angry when we see Wu Han using his pen to oppose the Party. We listen to the Party and follow the direction indicated by the Party, and we are on the right track. Wu Han, like those monsters and demons, is really dissatisfied with the happy life that the people are living. He called on the communes to return the land to the households and implement "going it alone." We use grain to feed Wu Han, and Wu Han eats his fill but does not do good deeds, but instead comes to oppose the people. How can we not be angry! Dong Yongmiao said, "Wu Han is a wolf, he can't be fed enough. He eats grain and grows six thorns!" Chairman Mao told us long ago that big snakes and small snakes, black snakes and white snakes, snakes with exposed fangs and snakes disguised as beautiful women, although they have sensed the threat of winter, are not yet frozen stiff! Wu Han is a representative of these poisonous snakes. Poor peasant commune member Gong Xinnian said: "Wu Han is really poisonous. He says the old society was good, what was good about it? I followed my mother from Shandong to Shaanxi to beg for food. In the old society, we had no food, no clothing, no fuel, no housing, no land, and lived a life that was not like human beings. Now we have everything we need. Wu Han shouts for 'returning the land,' which is calling on us to retrace the path of going it alone. We will never take that path!" Dong Yongmiao said angrily: "Wu Han wants to oppose the Party, and he thinks that by raising the banner of returning the land, we, the poor and lower-middle peasants, will support you, that's wishful thinking! My life was given to me by the Communist Party. Unlike you, you eat rice and forget the people who grow the grain." Wu Han saw the right-leaning opportunist elements becoming rampant, so he also waved the flag and shouted. But "the devil is only one foot tall, but the way is ten feet tall." Victory and success always belong to the people. Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist activities are nothing but moths flying into the flame.
    What Wu Han opposes is precisely what we love. The more Wu Han frantically opposes the Party and socialism, the more we must firmly stand on the proletarian stand, firmly stand on the poor and lower-middle peasant stand, the more we must love the Party, love socialism, love Chairman Mao, and love the people. We must carry forward the fine revolutionary tradition of the poor and lower-middle peasants, hold the gun tightly, hold the seal of power firmly, strike at class enemies, and defend the socialist country. We must study Chairman Mao's works more earnestly, do a good job in production, and do a good job in all work. What class enemies fear most is that we master Mao Zedong Thought. The more the enemy fears, the more we must study Chairman Mao's works. Study in the past, study now, study every day, study forever, study for a lifetime, use it for a lifetime, work for the Party for a lifetime, always follow the Party, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end.

    我们决不走回头路
    大荔县双泉公社南龙池大队贫农下中农协会主席　刘景亮
    吴晗骂我们党，尽夸旧社会好。翻开我们贫农下中农的苦难史来看看，比较一番，就知道吴晗为谁写文章，写些啥文章！
    在旧社会，我们受尽了苦。共产党来了，我们才翻了身。我们热爱党，吴晗却反对党，同党唱对台戏。党说：“人民公社好”，吴晗说：“退田才能使民安”，“不退占田不长久”。吴晗硬拆社会主义台。毛主席教导我们辨别香花毒草的六项标准，其中“最重要的是社会主义道路和党的领导两条”。吴晗的《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》的矛头，正好指向党和社会主义。
    毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题”。吴晗不仅给右倾机会主义帮大忙，还给地富反坏各种牛鬼蛇神帮了大忙。吴晗说他写历史人物是“古为今用”，实际上是用来反党反社会主义，我们贫农下中农坚决反对。谁赞成？只有那一小撮牛鬼蛇神。
    我们坚决不走回头路。看看旧社会里贫农、下中农受的什么罪吧！贫农社员董永淼，在解放前借了一石二斗粮的高利贷，以后把十三岁的妹子卖了，还了十石零八斗，十斤棉花，五块钱。可是，那个放高利贷的在一九六一年的时候，又向董永淼讨旧债。董永淼说：“我才借你一石多粮，却还了你十石多粮，又给棉，又给钱，你算算还的超过借的多少倍了吧。”放高利贷的说：“你知道我的账咋算法，这叫‘驴打滚’，利没完，本还没算。”看吧！放高利贷的人多么恶毒！吴晗写的《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》，为谁服务？还不是为这些人服务吗？
    我们贫下中农看到吴晗用他的笔来反党，非常气愤。我们听党的话，按党指示的方向，走得很对头。吴晗和那些牛鬼蛇神一样，对人民过的幸福生活实在不满意。他叫公社把土地放到户，实行“单干”。我们将粮养活吴晗，吴晗吃的有劲了，不做好事，却来反人民。怎么能使我们不气愤！董永淼说：“吴晗是狼，喂不饱，是吃了五谷，生六刺！”毛主席早就告诉我们，大蛇和小蛇，黑蛇和白蛇，露出毒牙的蛇和化成美女的蛇，虽然它们已经感觉到冬天的威胁，但是还没有冻僵呢！吴晗就是这些毒蛇的一个代表。贫农社员龚辛年说：“吴晗真毒。他说旧社会好，好什么？我从山东随母亲要饭到陕西来。在旧社会，我们无吃、无穿、无烧、无房、无地，过的不象人的生活。现在要啥有啥。吴晗叫喊“退田”，这是叫我们走单干的回头路，我们决不走那路！董永淼气愤地说：“吴晗要反党，打起退田的旗号，就以为我们贫下中农会拥护你，那是妄想！我的命是共产党给的，不象你吃米就忘了我们种谷人。”吴晗看见右倾机会主义分子猖狂起来，他也就摇旗呐喊。可是“魔高一尺，道高一丈”。胜利的、成功的总是人民。吴晗反党反社会主义的活动，不过是灯蛾扑火罢了。
    吴晗所反对的，正是我们所爱的。吴晗越是疯狂反党反社会主义，我们越要站稳无产阶级立场，站稳贫下中农立场，越要热爱党，热爱社会主义，热爱毛主席，热爱人民。我们要发扬贫下中农革命的优良传统，握紧枪杆子，保住印把子，打击阶级敌人，保卫社会主义江山。我们要更加认真地学习毛主席著作，搞好生产，搞好一切工作。阶级敌人最怕的是我们掌握毛泽东思想，敌人越害怕，我们就越要学习毛主席著作。过去学，现在学，天天学，永远学，学一辈子，用一辈子，为党工作一辈子，永远跟党走，把社会主义革命进行到底。
