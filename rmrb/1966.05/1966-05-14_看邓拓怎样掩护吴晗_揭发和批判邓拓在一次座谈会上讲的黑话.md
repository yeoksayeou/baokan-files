    See How Deng Tuo Shielded Wu Han
    —Exposing and Criticizing Deng Tuo's Black Talk at a Symposium
    At a symposium, Deng Tuo tried every possible means to defend Wu Han's crimes of opposing the Party and socialism. At the same time, he recklessly attacked "Wenhui Bao" for its thorough criticism of the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" as "doing very badly"; attacked "Liberation Army Daily" for affirming "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" as a big poisonous weed, saying it would make the "atmosphere in academic circles" "not lively"; and attacked Comrade Yao Wenyuan, saying that "the person who fires the first shot is not the person who draws the conclusion."
    Editor Comrade:
    After reading the article "Critique of 'Three-Family Village'" published in your newspaper on May 11th, we have further recognized the counter-revolutionary essence of "Yanshan Night Talks" and "Three-Family Village Notes," and how Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha, the three generals, echoed each other, shielded each other, and colluded with each other in their criminal activities against the Party and socialism.
    In this letter, I want to expose a carefully crafted piece of black talk made by Deng Tuo not long after the criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" began, and make it public so that "strange texts can be appreciated together, and doubts can be analyzed together."
    It was in December 1965, after major national newspapers and periodicals had comprehensively launched criticism of the anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weed "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," and Wu Han's problem was about to be exposed. How could the shopkeeper stand idly by while his assistant was being beaten? Thus, at 8:30 a.m. on December 14, 1965, Deng Tuo, in the name of the editorial department of "Beijing Daily," convened a symposium in the south conference room on the first floor of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee to discuss "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." More than a dozen leading cadres from Beijing's middle schools, language, political, and history teachers, and responsible comrades from teaching business leadership departments attended the symposium.
    At this symposium, Deng Tuo pretended to be important, posing as a leader of the Municipal Party Committee and a senior figure in academic circles, and delivered a vicious piece of black talk. Although this black talk was not long, the aspects it targeted were quite broad. The main points are as follows:
    Defending "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and exonerating Wu Han from the crimes of opposing the Party and socialism
    Deng Tuo said: "Comrade Yao Wenyuan published an article criticizing 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,' and there are different views on this issue. In fact, the central issue of this discussion is what viewpoint and ideology should guide theatrical creation."
    The criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is a serious class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, socialism and capitalism, on the cultural front. "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is a poisoned arrow aimed at the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and a stepping stone thrown out by the "Three-Family Village" black shop to carry out its criminal activities against the Party and socialism. Therefore, the criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" cannot but be a major event in our country's class struggle.
    Deng Tuo tried to replace the beams and pillars in this thrilling class struggle, merely wanting to shift the target of criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and change the combativeness of the criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." Deng Tuo cleverly played the trick of replacing beams and pillars that he had practiced in many years of anti-Party activity, trying to deceive people. In fact, who could he deceive? It just exposed his own fox tail.
    Wu Han said in his notorious "Self-Criticism on 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'": "I just look at the problem formalistically. Is good absolutely good? Is everything good? I just lack the critical spirit of Marxism, the critical spirit of historical materialism, and the scientific analysis method of dividing one into two." Wu Han's words were not original, but merely parrot-like. Deng Tuo had said at the symposium long ago: "The evaluation of Hai Rui cannot say that if he is good, everything is good, or that he completely represents peasants and citizens, which lacks a dialectical point of view."
    Look, how consistent are Deng Tuo and Wu Han's schemes, and how consistent is their language. Without careful planning in a secret room, is that possible? We can see how closely Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and this small group cooperated and took care of each other in carrying out their criminal activities against the Party and socialism!
    Deng Tuo implied that Wu Han's mistake was "lacking a dialectical point of view."
    What a "lack of a dialectical point of view"!
    Wu Han wields his pen, pointing directly at Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Is that "lacking a dialectical point of view"!
    Wu Han aimed at the Lushan Conference, secretly firing cold arrows. Is that "lacking a dialectical point of view"!
    Wu Han speaks for the right-leaning opportunists, desperately trying to redress their "dismissal." Is that still "lacking a dialectical point of view"!
    Deng Tuo here puts on a seemingly impartial face. In fact, his conspiracy to protect Wu Han is "Sima Zhao's heart, known to all passersby."
    In Deng Tuo's view, after he finished these few words, the play "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was protected. At most, its mistake was "guiding theatrical creation with bourgeois ideology," and at most, it was "lacking a dialectical point of view." Then what about the people who wrote the play?
    Listen to him say that Wu Han, "a bourgeois intellectual, whose worldview has not been thoroughly transformed, will always expose his own views on certain issues. Academic issues should be distinguished from political issues. Whether there are political issues will only be clear after discussion."
    Since the boss who is supporting him makes such an evaluation, it is no wonder that the assistant Wu Han said with impunity in his fake self-criticism: "Why did I make such a mistake? I now realize that on the one hand, for more than 20 years, I have been educated, cultivated, and cared for by the Party, and my political stance has been firm. But on the other hand, my class stance in academic thought is still basically old, old, and bourgeois, and even has feudal elements. I didn't pay attention to it, I didn't be vigilant, but I thought that there was no problem, and I relaxed my self-transformation. The problem lies here! The problem lies here!"
    Reading these two pieces of black talk side by side, it is easy to come to the conclusion again: when Deng Tuo and Wu Han launched an attack on the Party, it was not only purposeful and planned, but also when Wu Han's criminal activities against the Party and socialism were intercepted, and the "Three-Family Village" black shop was preparing to retreat, it was also planned and step-by-step, and they also shielded each other.
    These two pieces of black talk once again expose what an important role Deng Tuo played in the "Three-Family Village" black shop! The editor's note in "Beijing Daily" on April 16th insisted on placing Deng Tuo in the position of a small pawn. Isn't that making a big deal out of a small thing? Isn't that greatly wronging Deng Tuo, who has always advocated "using talents according to their abilities"?
    At the symposium, some comrades who did not know the truth thought that it seemed far-fetched to say that the author of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" had political motives, and that Wu Han had always been a leader in the city, "following the Party," and may have made mistakes unconsciously. Deng Tuo was very interested in this kind of speech, nodding frequently. It was "the speaker has no intention, but the listener is attentive," "using your words to convey my thoughts." In Deng Tuo's ears, these words were the most straightforward and pleasant to hear. However, he could not say it himself, otherwise, he would be bare-chested and rash. Where would he be the commander? Deng Tuo was very skilled and used the trick of substituting one thing for another here.
    At the symposium, another comrade said that "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" promoted bourgeois reformist thought, pointing out that Hai Rui's implementation of reformism could not fundamentally solve the sharp class contradictions in the Suzhou-Songjiang area. Therefore, he boldly envisioned that the ending of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" could be changed to project a raging fire on the stage with slides, indicating that the peasant uprising had become a prairie fire. This speech hit Deng Tuo's heart, precisely the visualized footnote of Deng Tuo's argument that "what viewpoint and ideology should guide theatrical creation." Therefore, after listening to it, Deng Tuo repeatedly praised it as a "very good speech" and asked him to leave the manuscript. The comrade said that he still had to go back to organize it. Deng Tuo hurriedly added: "Send it to the newspaper as soon as you finish writing it."
    Observe his words and watch his actions. Deng Tuo's criminal activities of sheltering Wu Han and exonerating Wu Han from the crimes of opposing the Party and socialism at this symposium, as well as the insidious intentions he showed, are obvious.
    Spouting nonsense, blatantly attacking "Wenhui Bao," and subtly attacking "Liberation Army Daily"
    Deng Tuo said that in the criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," "there should be full discussion. What the conclusion will be, we have to see from the discussion, and the atmosphere of discussion should be lively. 'Wenhui Bao' has done very badly in this regard. 'Wenhui Bao' has not published different opinions." "The most inappropriate thing is that they published the editor's note of 'Liberation Army Daily.' The editor's note of 'Liberation Army Daily' affirmed that 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' is a big poisonous weed. It is an internal newspaper. Why publish it publicly? Now the whole country is learning from the Liberation Army. If you write like this, who will raise different opinions?"
    Why did Deng Tuo attack "Wenhui Bao"? Why did he say that "Wenhui Bao" did very badly? In a word, it was because "Wenhui Bao" published Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article and was the first to organize the criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." Whoever's flesh is cut knows the pain. How could Deng Tuo not hate someone who pulled out his assistant and "whipped" him in front of everyone?
    Did he criticize "Wenhui Bao" for publishing the editor's note of "Liberation Army Daily" because "Liberation Army Daily" is an "internal newspaper"? No. Deng Tuo was trying to reduce the influence of the clear-cut editor's note of "Liberation Army Daily" so that his "fellow sufferers" could escape under the guise of academic discussion. The old drunkard's heart is not in the wine!
    Why was Deng Tuo so afraid of publicly publishing the editor's note of "Liberation Army Daily"?
    As he himself said at the meeting, because "now the whole country is learning from the Liberation Army. If you write like this, who will raise different opinions?" Because "if you write like this," "various different opinions" will not be fully expressed, and the atmosphere in academic circles will not be lively. "Anyone who holds just one kind of argument, one kind of conclusion, it's meaningless."
    In Deng Tuo's view, only when ghosts and monsters emerge one after another can the atmosphere in academic circles be considered lively, and only when "various schools of thought contend" is it "meaningful." The editor's note of "Liberation Army Daily" is like a strong east wind, shattering Deng Tuo's ideal soap bubble. Therefore, how could he not subtly attack "Liberation Army Daily"?
    The facts are clear, and everyone can see them. How can Deng Tuo hide this poisonous snake? Comrades, grab the snake's head, don't let go, and beat it hard.
    Using all his skills, retreating to advance, vainly attempting to slip away
    In this speech, in addition to the two aspects mentioned above, what other black talk did Deng Tuo say?
    When talking about Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article criticizing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," Deng Tuo put on a contemptuous attitude of disdain to argue, saying: "Yao Wenyuan said that the Hai Rui in 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' is a fake Hai Rui. Drama is not real anyway. We must make a fair evaluation, discuss issues, have academic debates, and not raise the tone higher and higher, so that others cannot speak. We must seek truth from facts." Then he indirectly came to a conclusion: "The person who fires the first shot is not the person who draws the conclusion." When talking about the issue of critically inheriting cultural heritage, he said: "Saying critically inheriting is inappropriate. Criticism and inheritance are opposed. We should say critically absorbing the essence." Please note that Deng Tuo is by no means imitating some old-fashioned Confucian scholars, wagging their heads and chewing on words. Even in this non-essential place, he does not forget to slander our great leader Chairman Mao. From this, we can see how much hatred he has for Chairman Mao.
    As the symposium was about to end, he repeatedly emphasized that everyone should write articles and said in a sickening way: "You are all very capable. I have read some of the articles you have written in the past. They are not academic." He also gave orders: Everyone should report the content of the meeting to the leadership after returning, organize the people who can write articles, everyone should write, and submit the manuscripts to "Beijing Daily."
    Deng Tuo wants us to write articles, of course, according to his point of view. If there is anything "out of line," submitting it to "Beijing Daily" will either be cut or not accepted. Can this achieve his expected goal of using criticism as a name and recruiting supporters as a reality?
    The convening of this symposium was an important step for Deng Tuo to compete with the Party and socialism. He adopted the strategy of retreating to advance and defending instead of attacking. At the symposium, he openly raised the black flag, recruited troops and bought horses, sacrificed various magic weapons, and used all his skills to escape the counterattack of the people.
    Editor Comrade: Here I also want to expose the bad influence caused by this symposium.
    After returning to school from the symposium, comrades asked what new spirit the meeting had and what Deng Tuo had said. I conveyed it to the comrades one by one. Some comrades even guided students' study and discussion with Deng Tuo's point of view. This once caused confusion in the thinking of teachers and students in our school. We must thoroughly settle the bad influence caused by Deng Tuo.
    On April 16th, "Beijing Daily" published materials on "The Criticism of 'Three-Family Village' and 'Yanshan Night Talks'" and added an editor's note. At that time, I thought that the editorial department of "Beijing Daily" would definitely publish the record of Deng Tuo's vicious speech in order to expose Deng Tuo's ferocious face. However, day after day, "Beijing Daily" continued to live peacefully. This situation could not help but make me feel suspicious. On May 8th, after "Liberation Army Daily" and "Guangming Daily" published articles by Comrades Gao Ju and He Ming respectively, the problem was completely revealed. This incident is enough to serve as circumstantial evidence that the editor's note of "Beijing Daily" on April 16th is still deceiving the vast number of readers.
    This struggle has given us a profound lesson. We must keep in mind the famous saying "Never forget class struggle," hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, brighten our eyes, and fight all demons and monsters to the end. We will never stop fighting until we win a complete victory!
    With revolutionary respect,

    看邓拓怎样掩护吴晗
    ——揭发和批判邓拓在一次座谈会上讲的黑话
    邓拓在一次座谈会上，千方百计为吴晗的反党反社会主义的罪行辩护。同时放肆地攻击《文汇报》彻底批判《海瑞罢官》的反党反社会主义罪行“做得很不好”；攻击《解放军报》把《海瑞罢官》肯定为一株大毒草会使“学术界的空气”“活跃不起来”；攻击姚文元同志，说什么“放第一炮的人，不是做结论的人”。编辑同志：
    读了你报五月十一日发表的《评“三家村”》的文章，我们进一步认清了《燕山夜话》《三家村札记》的反革命本质，以及邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙将帅三人，在反党反社会主义的罪恶活动中，是怎样彼此呼应，互相掩护，狼狈为奸的。
    在这封信中，我要揭露在《海瑞罢官》的批判开始不久，邓拓讲过的一篇“惨淡经营”的黑话，使它公诸于众，以便“奇文共欣赏，疑义相与析”。
    那是在一九六五年十二月，全国各大报刊全面开展了对《海瑞罢官》这一株反党反社会主义大毒草的批判之后，吴晗的问题，眼看就要揭盖子了。伙计挨打，掌柜哪能袖手旁观呢？于是在一九六五年十二月十四日上午八时半，邓拓以《北京日报》编辑部的名义，在中共北京市委一楼南侧会议室，召开了一次讨论《海瑞罢官》的座谈会。参加座谈的有北京市中学部分领导干部、语文政治历史教师以及教学业务领导部门的负责同志十几人。
    在这次座谈会上，邓拓装腔作势，以市委领导与学术界前辈自居，发表了一篇恶毒的黑话。这篇黑话，篇幅虽然不长，但枪刺指向的方面，却相当广泛。举其大端如下。
    为《海瑞罢官》辩护，替吴晗开脱反党反社会主义的罪行
    邓拓说：“姚文元同志发表了对《海瑞罢官》批评的文章，对这个问题是有不同看法的。实际上，这场讨论的中心问题，是要用什么观点、思想指导戏剧创作的问题”。
    对《海瑞罢官》的批判，是文化战线上无产阶级与资产阶级，社会主义与资本主义两个阶级、两条道路的严重的阶级斗争。《海瑞罢官》是射向以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的一枝毒箭，是为“三家村”黑店进行反党反社会主义罪恶活动所投出的一块问路石。因此，对于《海瑞罢官》的批判，就不能不是我们国家阶级斗争中的重大事件。
    邓拓把这场惊心动魄的阶级斗争，如此偷梁换柱，不过是想转移批判《海瑞罢官》的目标，改变批判《海瑞罢官》的斗争性。邓拓自作聪明，玩弄从多年反党活动中操练出来的偷梁换柱的伎俩，想以此障人耳目。其实，能瞒得了谁呢？正好暴露了他自己的狐狸尾巴。
    吴晗在他臭名昭彰的《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》中曾说：“我就是形式主义地看问题，好的就是绝对好吗？一切皆好吗？我就是没有马克思主义的批判精神，没有历史唯物主义的批判精神，没有一分为二的科学分析方法。”吴晗的这段话，并非独创，不过是鹦鹉学舌而已。邓拓在座谈会上早就说过：“对海瑞的评价，不能说他好，就都好，说他完全代表农民、市民，这就缺乏辩证的观点。”
    请看，邓拓、吴晗，他们的计谋多么一致，语言又是那样的吻合，没有密室中的精心策划，难道是可能的吗？我们可以看出，邓拓吴晗这一小撮人，在进行反党反社会主义的罪恶活动中，是怎么样密切配合、互相关照啊！
    邓拓暗指吴晗所犯错误就是“缺乏辩证的观点”。
    好一个“缺乏辩证的观点”！
    吴晗挥动刀笔，直指毛主席、党中央，难道是“缺乏辩证的观点”！
    吴晗对准庐山会议，暗放冷箭，难道是“缺乏辩证的观点”！
    吴晗为右倾机会主义者张目，声嘶力竭地替他们的“罢官”鸣不平，难道还是“缺乏辩证的观点”！
    邓拓在这里摆出一种不偏不倚的中庸面孔。其实，他庇护吴晗的阴谋，已是“司马昭之心，路人皆知”了。
    在邓拓看来，他说完这几句打腰的话，《海瑞罢官》这出戏算是护住了。它充其量的错误不过是“以资产阶级思想指导戏剧创作”而已，充其量不过是“缺乏辩证的观点”而已。那么戏是人写的，人又怎么样呢？
    你看他说，吴晗这样“一个资产阶级知识分子，世界观没有得到彻底的改造，总要在某些问题上暴露出自己的观点。学术问题与政治问题要有区别，有无政治问题，讨论完才清楚”。
    既然撑腰的老板做出这样的评价，难怪伙计吴晗在他的假检讨中，有恃无恐地说：“为什么会犯这样的错误呢？我现在认识到，一方面二十多年来一直在党的教育、培养、关怀下，政治上的立场是站稳了的。但在另一方面，学术思想上的阶级立场，却还基本上是旧的、老的、资产阶级的，以至还有封建的东西，没有注意，没有警惕，反而自以为没有什么问题了，放松了自我改造，问题就出在这里！毛病也就出在这里！”
    这两段黑话对照来读，很容易就会再次得出结论：邓拓、吴晗当初向党展开进攻时，不但是有目的、有计划的，就是在吴晗的反党反社会主义的罪恶活动遭到截击，“三家村”黑店在准备退却时，也是有计划、有步骤的，也是互为掩护的。
    这两段黑话，再一次暴露了在“三家村”黑店中，邓拓起的是怎样的重要作用啊！《北京日报》四月十六日的编者按，却硬把邓拓放在小卒的地位上，难道不是大材小用吗？难道不是大大地委屈了一向主张“量才而用之”的邓拓吗？
    在座谈会上，有个别不明真相的同志发言认为，说《海瑞罢官》的作者有政治目的，显得牵强；认为吴晗一直是市里领导，“跟着党走”，可能是不自觉地犯了错误。邓拓对这种发言，十分感兴趣，频频点首。正是“言者无心，听者有意”，“借你口中言，传我心上事”了。象这样的话，在邓拓听来，是最干脆利落，动听不过的了。然而，他又不能亲自说，否则赤膊上阵，有勇无谋，那里还算主帅呢？邓拓很会耍手腕，这里，他使用了李代桃僵之计。
    在座谈会上，还有一位同志发言，认为《海瑞罢官》宣扬了资产阶级改良主义思想，指出海瑞实行改良主义，根本不能解决苏淞地区尖锐的阶级矛盾。因此，他大胆设想，认为可将《海瑞罢官》的结尾，改成以幻灯在舞台上打出熊熊燃烧的烈火，表明农民起义已成燎原之势。这个发言，正中邓拓下怀，正是邓拓的“要以什么样的观点思想指导戏剧创作”论调的形象化的注脚。因此邓拓听完之后，连连称赞“发言很好”，并要求他把发言稿留下。这位同志说，还要回去整理，邓拓赶忙叮上一句：“写好马上寄给报社。”
    察其言，观其行。邓拓在这次座谈会上所干的包庇吴晗、开脱吴晗反党反社会主义罪行的罪恶活动，以及表现出来的阴险用心，是昭然若揭了。
    大放厥词，明目张胆地攻击《文汇报》，含沙射影地攻击《解放军报》
    邓拓说，在对《海瑞罢官》的批判当中，“要充分讨论，究竟结论怎么样，还得从讨论中看，要把讨论空气活跃起来。这一点《文汇报》做得很不好。《文汇报》没有发表不同意见”。“最不应该的是，他们把《解放军报》的编者按也登载出来了。《解放军报》的编者按肯定了《海瑞罢官》是一株大毒草。人家是内部报纸，为什么要公开发表呢？现在全国都在学习解放军，你这样一写，谁还提不同意见呢？”
    邓拓为什么要攻击《文汇报》呢？为什么要说《文汇报》做得很不好呢？一句话，就是因为《文汇报》发表了姚文元同志的文章，并最先组织了对《海瑞罢官》的批判。割了谁的肉，谁就知道疼。拉出他的伙计，在众人面前“抽打”，怎能不引起邓拓的仇恨呢？
    他指责《文汇报》不该登《解放军报》的编者按，是因为《解放军报》是“内部报纸”吗？否。邓拓就是力图缩小旗帜鲜明的《解放军报》编者按的影响，以便使他的“难友”在学术讨论的幌子下，逃之夭夭。醉翁之意不在酒啊！
    邓拓为什么这样害怕公开发表《解放军报》的编者按呢？
    正如他自己在会上所说，因为“现在全国都在学习解放军，你这样一写，谁还提不同意见呢？”因为“你这样一写”，“各种不同的意见”就不好充分发表，学术界的空气就活跃不起来。“任何人都是一种论调，一种结论，就没意思了。”
    在邓拓看来，牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼，才算学术界空气活跃，“杂家大放异采”，才算“有意思”。而《解放军报》的编者按，正象一股强烈的东风，把邓拓理想的肥皂泡沫吹个粉碎。因此，他怎能不含沙射影地攻击《解放军报》呢？
    事实昭昭，有目共睹。邓拓这条毒蛇怎么掩藏得了呢？同志们，揪住蛇头，不要撒手，狠狠地打。
    使出全身解数，以退为进，妄图溜之大吉
    邓拓在这篇讲话中，除了矛头指向上述两个方面以外，还讲了哪些黑话呢？
    邓拓在谈到姚文元同志批判《海瑞罢官》的文章时，摆出不屑与争的轻蔑态度说：“姚文元说《海瑞罢官》中的海瑞是假海瑞，戏嘛，本来就不是真的。我们要做公正的评价，讨论问题，学术争论，调子不要越来越高，使旁人不好说话了，要实事求是。”然后他又旁敲侧击地下个结论：“放第一炮的人，不是做结论的人。”在谈到批判地继承文化遗产的问题时，他说：“说批判地继承，就是不妥当，批判与继承是对立的，我们应该说，批判地吸取精华。”请注意，邓拓决不是效仿一些遗老腐儒，摇头摆尾地咬文嚼字。就是在这并非肯綮之处，他也不忘对我们伟大领袖毛主席进行诋毁。我们从这里可以看出，他对毛主席怀有多么刻骨的仇恨。
    座谈会将要结束时，他一再强调大家要写稿子，并肉麻地说：“你们都很有能力，过去写的文章，有的我也看过，没有学究气。”他还发号施令：要大家回去以后把会议内容向领导汇报，把能写文章的人组织起来，大家动笔，写出稿子以后，投给《北京日报》社。
    邓拓要我们写文章，当然是按照他的观点来写。如果有“越轨”的地方，寄给《北京日报》，不是遭到斧削，便是不予录用。难道这样就可以达到了他预期的以批判为名、网罗支持者为实的目的吗？
    这次座谈会的召开，是邓拓同党、同社会主义进行较量的一个重要步骤。他采用了以退为进，以守代攻的策略。在座谈会上，他公然扯起黑旗，招兵买马，祭起各种各样的法宝，使出全身的解数，以求逃脱人民群众的反击。
    编辑同志：我在这里还要向你们揭露这次座谈会所造成的恶劣影响。
    参加完座谈会回校以后，同志们纷纷询问，会议有些什么新的精神？邓拓讲了什么内容？我便一五一十地向同志们作了传达。更有的同志，便以邓拓的观点指导了学生的学习讨论。这曾一度在我校造成师生思想的混乱。对于邓拓所造成的恶劣影响，我们必须彻底清算。
    四月十六日，《北京日报》发表了《关于“三家村”和〈燕山夜话〉的批判》的材料，并且加了一个编者按。当时我想，《北京日报》编辑部一定会把邓拓这篇恶毒讲话的记录公布出来，以便揭露邓拓的狰狞面目。然而，日复一日，《北京日报》仍在安稳稳地过日子。这种情况，不禁使我心中疑云密布。五月八日，《解放军报》、《光明日报》分别发了高炬与何明同志的文章以后，问题才完全水落石出。这件事情，也足以作为《北京日报》四月十六日的编者按仍在向广大读者进行欺骗的旁证。
    这场斗争，给我们以深刻的教训，必须牢记“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”这句名言，高举毛泽东思想红旗，擦亮眼睛，与一切妖魔鬼怪斗争到底，不获全胜，决不收兵！　此致
