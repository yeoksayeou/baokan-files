    Holding the Good News, Thinking of the Party
    Five-Good Soldier Ye Mingshan
    The Five-Good Soldier receives his award,
    My heart is thumping fast.
    I straighten my uniform and step forward,
    Holding the good news, thinking of the Party.
    I remember when I first joined the army last year,
    I was only this tall.
    Fair skin, skinny legs,
    Opening my mouth, a student's accent through and through.
    Party, it is you who nurtured and taught me,
    The child who has grown up remembers his mother...
    Political instructor who performed meritorious service at Shangganling,
    I will never forget you.
    The first "Selected Works of Mao" was given by you,
    The first time you helped me clean my gun.
    Talking about the world, you made me clench my fists tight,
    Telling family history, you brought tears to my eyes.
    You cut my hair when it grew long,
    You helped me mend my uniform late at night.
    Political instructor, good leader,
    Today I firmly grasp my gun to make revolution—
    Thinking of you makes me think even more of the Party.
    Model Party member, old squad leader,
    You led me through wind and rain.
    Climbing together, rolling together,
    Laboring together, standing guard together.
    You lectured me on "On Practice" under the oil lamp,
    On the training ground, you told me to defend against stabbing.
    Good Party member, old squad leader,
    Today my heart is red, my skin dark, and my bones strong—
    Thinking of you makes me think even more of the Party.
    Thinking of you makes me think even more of the Party,
    Thinking of Mao transforms iron into steel,
    Thinking of bamboo shoots meeting spring rain,
    Thinking of saplings growing into beams…
    Thousands of feelings in one sentence,
    One sentence spoken loud and clear:
    I will always be a good soldier of Chairman Mao,
    I will shoulder the cause of the proletariat!

    手捧喜报心想党
    五好战士　叶明山五好战士领奖状，我心跳得咚咚响。整一整军装走向前，手捧喜报心想党。记得去年刚参军，我才这么长。白净的脸皮瘦瘦的腿，张嘴满口学生腔。党啊，是您养我教导我，孩子成人记得娘……上甘岭立过功的指导员，我永远不会把您忘。第一本“毛选”是您送，第一次是您帮我擦的枪。谈天下，谈得我拳头捏紧，讲家史，讲得我眼泪汪汪。头发长了您给理，深夜帮我补军装。指导员啊好首长，今天我紧握枪杆闹革命——想起了您啊更想党。模范党员老班长呀，带我风里雨里闯。一道爬，一道滚，同劳动，同站岗。油灯下给我讲《实践论》，操场上他刺要我防。好党员啊老班长，今天我心红皮黑骨头硬——想起了您啊更想党。想起了您啊更想党，想起了毛铁变成钢，想起了竹笋逢春雨，想起了幼树成栋梁……感想万千话一句，一句话出口响当当：永做毛主席的好战士，无产阶级大业我承当！
