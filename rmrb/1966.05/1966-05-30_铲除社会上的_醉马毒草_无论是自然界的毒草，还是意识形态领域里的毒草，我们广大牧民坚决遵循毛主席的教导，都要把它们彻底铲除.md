    Eradicating the "Intoxicating Horse Poisonous Weed" in Society
    Whether it be poisonous weeds in the natural world or poisonous weeds in the ideological sphere, we, the vast number of herdsmen, resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings and must thoroughly eradicate them.
    Baoriledai, Vice Chairman of the Poor Peasants Association of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Secretary of the Buludu Brigade Branch of Wushenzhao Commune
    Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party black thugs used coded language to scold our Party for "not cherishing labor," "banging their heads until they bleed," and being "untrustworthy," even arrogantly demanding that our Party step down and "rest." Deng Tuo, the Party and Chairman Mao are the saviors of all our ethnic groups. You attack our beloved Party and Chairman Mao. We, the vast number of herdsmen, will resolutely strike you all down like eliminating wolves on the grasslands.
    Just like all class enemies at home and abroad, the Deng Tuo black gang also aimed their attacks at the great red flag of our general line for building socialism. Let me tell you, you demons and monsters, the great red flag of the general line for building socialism has long been rooted, blossomed, and borne rich fruit in the hearts of our vast number of herdsmen. It is only wishful thinking for you to try to shake our infinite love and faith in it. Precisely because we have held high the great red flag of the general line for building socialism, we, the people of Wushenzhao, have, since 1958, eradicated the intoxicating horse poisonous weed on a cumulative area of ten thousand mu; afforested more than 60,000 mu of shifting sand, reclaiming pasture from the desert; and also built water conservancy projects, created "grass gardens," and built 3,300 mu of basic farmland that guarantees harvests regardless of drought or flood. This has opened up a path to building the grasslands and raising livestock by human effort. Since then, livestock production on the severely adverse sandy grasslands of Wushenzhao has finally achieved stable development, and people's lives have significantly improved. All of this has been achieved under the guidance of the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and the general line.
    When we raised the red flag of the general line for building socialism and marched towards building the grasslands, coincidentally, some reactionary large herdowners and reactionary upper-level lamas also viciously cursed us, saying that building the grasslands was "wasteful of manpower and resources," that "the intoxicating horse poisonous weed on the grasslands can never be eradicated," that "reforming the desert is killing the living sand sagebrush and destroying the grasslands," and so on, also clamoring for our Party to step down. It can be seen that the Deng Tuo black gang and these demons and monsters are singing the same tune and are of the same ilk. It turns out that Deng Tuo is their spokesperson. We want to solemnly tell Deng Tuo: You want to drag us back to the era of allowing the intoxicating horse poisonous weed to poison our livestock, allowing the desert to engulf our grasslands, and allowing the princes and herd owners to trample us underfoot. This is absolutely impossible!
    Deng Tuo and his gang of black thugs also said that Chairman Mao's thesis of "the East wind prevailing over the West wind" is "grand empty talk." This is a direct attack on the great Mao Zedong Thought. Look, to what extent has this gang of black thugs become arrogant and mad! Let me tell Deng Tuo and his gang of black thugs, Mao Zedong Thought is the unsetting sun in the hearts of our vast number of herdsmen. We love Mao Zedong Thought, and we have grown up entirely relying on Mao Zedong Thought for nourishment. A saying is circulating among the vast number of herdsmen: "We have no trains in our desert, not even cars, but as long as we have Mao Zedong Thought, we will embark on the bright road!" Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis of "the East wind prevailing over the West wind" has given us the best spiritual weapon and great encouragement in the current three great revolutionary movements, enabling us to dare to struggle, dare to win, and achieve one success after another. We clearly tell Deng Tuo and his gang of black thugs that if you dare to attack Mao Zedong Thought, our vast number of herdsmen will never agree. We must fight you to the end and settle this score to the end!
    On our desert grasslands, the intoxicating horse poisonous weed grows whenever the climate is harsh. In the field of class struggle, class enemies also stir restlessly and seize the opportunity to emerge whenever they have a chance. Whether it be poisonous weeds in the natural world or poisonous weeds in the ideological sphere, we, the vast number of herdsmen, resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings and must thoroughly eradicate them. Apart from poisonous weeds being good for fertilizing the fields, bad things can be turned into good things. After this contest with Deng Tuo and others, we have improved our ability to identify the insidious methods of class enemies who wave the "red flag" to oppose the red flag and engage in "peaceful evolution," and enhanced our awareness of the enemy's situation. We resolutely raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and carry the socialist cultural revolution through to the end.

    铲除社会上的“醉马毒草”
    无论是自然界的毒草，还是意识形态领域里的毒草，我们广大牧民坚决遵循毛主席的教导，都要把它们彻底铲除
    内蒙古自治区贫协副主席乌审召公社布尔都大队支部书记  宝日勒代
    邓拓一伙反党黑帮用黑话骂我们的党“不爱护劳动力”、“碰得头破血流”、“不堪信任”，甚至狂妄地要我们的党下台“休息”。邓拓，党和毛主席是我们各族人民的救星，你们攻击我们敬爱的党和毛主席，我们广大牧民就象消灭草原上的恶狼一样，坚决把你们全部打倒。
    正象国内外一切阶级敌人一样，邓拓黑帮也把攻击的矛头对准我们建设社会主义总路线的伟大红旗。告诉你们这些牛鬼蛇神，建设社会主义总路线的伟大红旗在我们广大牧民心中早已扎根开花，结出了丰硕的果实。你们想动摇我们对它的无限热爱和信仰，这只是妄想。正由于我们高举了建设社会主义总路线的伟大红旗，我们乌审召人从一九五八年开始，在累计万亩面积上，铲除了醉马毒草；绿化了六万多亩流沙，向沙漠要来了草场；还兴水利，建“草园”，修起了三千三百亩旱涝保收的粮料基本田。这就开辟了一条建设草原，靠人养畜的道路。从此，自然环境十分恶劣的乌审召沙丘草原上畜牧业生产终于得到了稳定发展，人民生活有了显著提高。所有这一切，全是在毛泽东思想红旗和总路线指引下取得的。
    当我们高举建设社会主义总路线的红旗向建设草原进军的时候，无独有偶，一些反动的大牧主和反动的上层喇嘛，也恶毒地咒骂我们说，建设草原是“劳民伤财”啦，“草场上的醉马草是除不完的”啦，“改造沙漠是把活沙蒿栽死，破坏了草场”啦，等等，也叫嚣要我们党下台。可见邓拓黑帮同这些牛鬼蛇神是一鼻孔出气的，是一路货色。原来，邓拓正是他们的代言人。我们要正告邓拓：你们要拉我们回到听凭醉马草毒死我们的牲畜，听凭沙漠侵吞我们的草场，听凭王公、牧主把我们踩在脚下的时代，这是绝对办不到的！
    邓拓这伙黑帮，还说毛主席关于“东风压倒西风”的论断是“伟大的空话”，这是直接攻击伟大的毛泽东思想。看，这伙黑帮嚣张狂妄到什么程度了！告诉邓拓这伙黑帮，毛泽东思想是我们广大牧民心中不落的太阳。我们热爱毛泽东思想，我们是全靠毛泽东思想哺育成长的。广大牧民流传着一句话：“我们沙漠里没有火车，甚至不通汽车，但是只要有了毛泽东思想，就是走上了光明大道！”毛主席关于“东风压倒西风”的英明论断，在当前的三大革命运动中给了我们最好的精神武器和极大的鼓舞力量，使我们敢于斗争、敢于胜利，取得了一个又一个的成就。我们明白告诉邓拓这伙黑帮，你们胆敢攻击毛泽东思想，我们广大牧民绝不答应，一定要同你们斗到底，一定要把这笔账算到底！
    在我们沙漠草原上，一到气候恶劣的年头，就要长起醉马毒草，在阶级斗争领域里，阶级敌人也是一有机会就蠢蠢欲动，趁机出笼。无论是自然界的毒草，还是意识形态领域里的毒草，我们广大牧民坚决遵循毛主席的教导，都要把它们彻底铲除。除了毒草好肥田，坏事就能变成好事。经过这次同邓拓等较量，我们对阶级敌人打着“红旗”反红旗，搞“和平演变”的阴险手法，提高了识别能力，增强了敌情观念。我们坚决更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把社会主义文化大革命进行到底。
