    Utterly Absurd
    Since Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi came to power, she has incessantly engaged in anti-China clamoring. Because what she says, over and over, is nothing more than that set of bankrupt platitudes, people have long ceased to be surprised. This prime minister has recently come up with a new trick, launching new attacks on China. She has even attributed India's serious food shortage to China and Pakistan, claiming that China and Pakistan's "aggression" and "invasion" against India have "disrupted India's plans to improve agricultural production." Such preposterous arguments from the Indian Prime Minister are truly utterly absurd.
    Everyone knows that India's extremely severe food crisis is entirely caused by the Indian government's reactionary policies that harm the country and the people. Within India, there is already widespread resentment against the ruling authorities' disastrous policies, and the struggle against hunger is increasingly developing. Now, the Indian Prime Minister, disregarding the ridicule of the world, wants to shift the responsibility onto the people of China and Pakistan. This shows that the Indian rulers are unable to quell the anger of the broad masses of Indian people and are attempting to use the so-called "aggression" and "invasion" of India by China and Pakistan as a shield. This demonstrates just how difficult the Indian government's situation is domestically today.
    Indira Gandhi's nonsense also precisely illustrates that the Indian reactionaries' past armed aggression against China and armed invasion of Pakistan, as well as their continued anti-China and anti-Pakistan activities today, are aimed not only at realizing their expansionist ambitions but also at diverting the attention of the domestic people. However, as facts have already proven, Indira Gandhi and her ilk's attempt to alleviate the Indian people's strong dissatisfaction with the Indian government's reactionary rule through vicious curses against China and Pakistan is absolutely impossible. If the Indian ruling authorities do not change their current reactionary domestic and foreign policies, India's food crisis will certainly not be resolved, but will worsen, and the Indian people's struggle of resistance will inevitably become even more intense.

    穷极无聊
    印度总理英迪拉·甘地上台以来，一直不断进行反华叫嚣。由于她说来说去，无非是那一套早已破产的滥调，人们早已不以为怪。这位总理最近又别出心裁地对中国发出新的攻击。她竟把印度的严重粮荒，归咎于中国和巴基斯坦，说什么由于中国和巴基斯坦对印度的“侵略”和“入侵”，“打乱了印度提高农业生产的计划”。印度总理的这种奇谈怪论实在是穷极无聊。
    谁都知道，印度极端严重的粮食危机，完全是印度政府执行祸国殃民的反动政策所造成的。在印度国内，对于印度统治当局的这种灾难政策，已经怨声载道，反饥饿的斗争正在日益发展。印度总理现在不顾贻笑于天下，想把责任推到中国和巴基斯坦人民的身上，这说明印度统治者已无法平息广大印度人民的怒火，妄图拿所谓中国和巴基斯坦对印度的“侵略”和“入侵”这种鬼话来作挡箭牌。印度政府今天在国内的处境何等困难，由此可见。
    英迪拉·甘地的胡言乱语，同时也正好说明了，印度反动派过去对中国进行武装侵犯和对巴基斯坦发动武装侵略，以及今天继续进行反华和反对巴基斯坦，除了要实现其扩张主义的野心之外，还有着转移国内人民视线的目的。但是，正如事实已经证明的那样，英迪拉·甘地之流想用对中国和巴基斯坦的恶毒咒骂来缓和印度人民对印度政府反动统治的强烈不满情绪，是绝对办不到的。印度统治当局不改变其现行的国内外反动政策，印度的粮食危机就肯定解决不了，而且还要恶化，印度人民的反抗斗争必然要更进一步的剧烈起来。
