Title: A Negative Example Who Jumped Out On His Own

Edition: 4

    Mr. Ping Xin’s article published in the *Wenhui Bao* on March 31st①, is filled with bitter class hatred towards those who criticize him. This is the most nakedly exposed article since the discussion of *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office*, revealing the true face of certain "scholars" and "professors." This is a rare negative example who jumped out on his own. It is hoped that comrades will take the time to read it patiently, as it can brighten the eyes of many. It can powerfully refute views such as "the debate is almost over" and "the struggle is nearing its end." It can vividly educate people to recognize how sharp, fierce, and profound the class struggle currently underway is. It can make some of Mr. Ping Xin's "colleagues" and "friends" see what will happen if they kindly advise Mr. Ping Xin. It tells all revolutionaries on the political and ideological fronts that they must not slacken their fighting spirit in the slightest.

    Mr. Ping Xin has exhausted all insulting vocabulary. What "thoughts are quick but words are ineffective," what "spraying with saliva," what "wielding a writing brush as a bow and arrow," what "chopping with a giant axe without principle or standard," what "shooting a seemingly sharp and cunning but actually unable to penetrate thin silk arrow from a dark corner," what "with a whoosh, stirring up a violent wind that destroys forests and uproots trees," what wanting to "sweep the newly planted seedlings in the garden cultivated by the gardener into the cesspool at once," what "unconditionally throwing into the Avici hell of forty thousand yojanas," what "a broken hat designed in the brain," what "seeing the people as enemies," what "new members of the black gang"... He has used every venomous word he could think of. Only someone who harbors deep hatred for this discussion would use such language to vent his inner emotions. Comrades and friends, please think: what position is Mr. Ping Xin taking?

    Why is Mr. Ping Xin so furious? This is because two very short articles hit his sore spot. Mr. Ping Xin actually has no intention of conducting any "upright official" discussion. He is merely using this discussion to achieve another purpose. He hopes that others will "revolve" around the long list of "good officials" he has drawn up, walk into the maze of tedious discussions, become dizzy and muddled, and not expose the anti-Party and anti-socialist reactionary essence and reactionary thought of Wu Han, deviating from the main goal of this sharp political and ideological struggle, leading us astray. This is also a tactic to cooperate with Wu Han's offensive. However, the criticism articles simply do not "revolve" around the questions he raised. They immediately singled out the "honeysuckle plant" he had intentionally inserted, revealing that he wanted to take this opportunity to promote the eternal longevity of "upright officials." Thus, he felt very ashamed and jumped up. In fact, this precisely proves that the original criticism was to the point. If he really wanted to discuss some "more important issues," would he spend so much effort refuting a "rhetorically powerful but ineffective" remark on this "individual word"?

    Mr. Ping Xin has exposed himself. By insulting the other party as "archer," he admitted that he was the target and that he was standing on the opposite side of this discussion. He said that a few words of criticism from others "stirred up a violent wind that destroys forests and uproots trees," which admits his outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature. Although his appearance is so fierce, in fact, his core is fragile. The slightest disturbance is regarded as a "violent wind." He cursed that others' criticism of him was to "sweep the newly planted seedlings in the garden cultivated by the gardener" "into the cesspool," which tells us exactly that this "gardener" really wants to cultivate a group of capitalist "new seedlings" (including "upright officials" appearing in the guise of "honeysuckle plants") on socialist land. He hopes that this group of "new seedlings" will grow tall and strong. He sees himself as the gardener who protects this group of "new seedlings." "In order to be responsible for the current revolution," shouldn't we further analyze what varieties of "new seedlings" Mr. Ping Xin has always cultivated, and where its roots are? Mr. Ping Xin once cursed that "peasants only stumble in desperate rebellion and brutal failure" and "the people squirm in a stagnant spiritual life of ignorance," ② distorting the great Chinese people into "ignorant" creatures "squirming" like insects. Shouldn't these things be brought out to see the sun?

    Mr. Ping Xin's use of such deeply hateful language is not accidental. In his historical works published after liberation, he used terms like "Communist elements" and "Communist faction," which were used by the enemy to curse the Communist Party. He said that after 1927, "Communist elements" "launched land revolution in various places, which is the source of today's Red Army civil war"; and that "the Communist Party" "armed a part of the peasants, which became the source of the Red Army rebellion in the future." He praised Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government stained with the blood of the people: "Later, Beijing and Tianjin were recovered by the Party army... The national flag was flying all over the country, and Zhang Xueliang also expressed his belief in the Three People's Principles and obedience to the National Government." ③ Look, the great peasant revolutionary war led by the Communist Party is called "rebellion," and the counter-revolutionary cause of the Kuomintang reactionaries is called "recovery." Isn't the class position of Mr. Ping Xin, this "professor," clear? Understanding this, it is not surprising to see Mr. Ping Xin cursing "new members of the black gang"... today.

    This time, Mr. Ping Xin also satirized "several colleagues" and "friends" of "our school," expressing "pity" and "disappointment." Why bring this up? This is because his "colleagues" and "friends" have improved their understanding and disagreed with his two-standard theory, which made him very unhappy. Look, Mr. Ping Xin is untouchable, even if you kindly help him, he will refuse. Mr. Ping Xin is free to do so, but shouldn't Mr. Ping Xin's "friends" and "colleagues" further see his soul from this incident?

    "Can the discussion be over?" No, not only does the criticism of Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds need to be deepened, but Mr. Ping Xin is also preparing to write article after article! In the footnote of the previous article, he wrote: "In the future, I plan to further discuss it in a special article"; in this article, he declared that "it can only be stated in another special discussion." No one knows how many more "special articles" and "special discussions," longer and more "special," he will write. However, one thing is clear: he will not implement any "policy of concession," but will insist on implementing an offensive policy. In his articles published in *Academic Monthly* and *Wenhui Bao*, Mr. Ping Xin twice put forward the slogan of anti-"Left" leaning. He pays close attention to launching an offensive politically, adding a label of "'Left' opportunism" to the current criticism of Wu Han, fundamentally negating it. Comrades, please note: Some anti-communist intellectuals and their agents are intentionally putting a hat of "'Left' opportunism" on this great debate and great revolution against capitalist restoration and defending socialism and the proletarian dictatorship. Mr. Ping Xin, relying on his class sensitivity, has repeatedly shouted this slogan, which should arouse our high vigilance. This time, he again proposed that historical science "has distinct class content and complex life content." This "complex life content" is used to revise and cancel the "distinct class content." It is the bourgeois theory of human nature and bourgeois sociology that is diametrically opposed to the Marxist theory of class struggle. The existence of class struggle is an objective law that does not depend on people's will. Some people want to go through the motions, but Mr. Ping Xin and others insist on attacking. Some people want to reduce the sharpness of the debate, but Mr. Ping Xin and others insist on filling the page with a smell of gunpowder. What can be done about this! It seems that this is not a quick battle, but may be a protracted war. A greater cultural revolution climax will arrive soon, and the sound of the surging tide can already be heard! All revolutionaries are raising their hands and warmly welcoming it!

    Mr. Ping Xin believes that he has two magic weapons that can guarantee everything. One is the so-called "I have learned many times in the past." He believes that the old tactics used "many times" in the past discussions of "productive forces theory" and other disputes can also be used in this debate: Anyway, whether I am right or wrong, I will write articles horizontally and vertically, see what you can do. Everyone is exhausted, and no one wants to read this kind of article anymore; I am still writing, writing until the "last day," and I will be "victorious." The second is to cling to Comrade Xing Yu's "upright official" theory as a shield. Not only was it used in the previous article, but this article also threatened more aggressively: "May I ask if evidence needs to be listed?" Dare you criticize Ping Xin again? If he "lists evidence," even the article "deeply criticizing Comrade Wu Han" will collapse. However, we can frankly tell Mr. Ping Xin that the sky will not fall, and thorough materialists are never afraid to face the truth. They are determined to thoroughly expose everything anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong thought, let alone a "upright official" issue? Who is right and who is wrong will eventually be clarified in the debate. You have your own set, and it is impossible to cling to others. Don't think you have grabbed a lifebuoy, it may just be a rotten straw, then what to do? It is better to tell the truth in your heart. As for the old methods you have used "many times," it remains to be seen how effective they will be this time. We welcome Mr. Ping Xin to continue writing articles to participate in the discussion, so as to prove in practice whether the result of this discussion is the same as the "many" previous discussions that Mr. Ping Xin proudly boasted about.

    Shanghai is the place where the proletariat and the bourgeoisie are most concentrated. Since liberation, many major struggles between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie have broken out in Shanghai. The nature of the bourgeoisie is the same. But because Shanghai was directly controlled by imperialism for a long time before liberation, it was the "Bund of Ten Miles," and the bourgeoisie in Shanghai is more "foreign" than in the north. This characteristic is also reflected in the intellectual circles. Someone proposed some strange "foreign upright officials" in the "upright official" discussion, as if even the reactionary bureaucrats who slaughtered and deceived the people were better as "foreign goods." Lu Xun once criticized some bourgeois intellectuals in Shanghai as "young hooligans in foreign concessions," which was aimed at their slavish and rogue habits. Why would a Mr. Ping Xin, who calls himself a "scholar" and "historical materialist," write those unspeakable words? This certainly requires finding the reason in Mr. Ping Xin's class feelings, but it also requires finding the reason in the characteristics of the Shanghai bourgeoisie. This can make us understand more deeply what class struggle is. Mr. Ping Xin wrote a book *People's Literary Master Lu Xun*, boasting that he was a "young fighter" who was "very fortunate to have come into contact with world thought since childhood," that is, "the documents of European and American revolutionary masters and democratic sages." ④ Putting a hat of Western "literary master" on the great revolutionary fighter Lu Xun is already a reflection of how infatuated Mr. Ping Xin is with bourgeois foreign "literary masters"; taking the acceptance of the doctrines of American bourgeois "sages" as "fortunate" is even more a vivid portrayal of someone prostrating himself at the feet of the Western bourgeoisie. This is precisely the character of the bourgeoisie who worship the decadent "Western civilization." Mr. Ping Xin will never be silent. He will certainly speak. He will certainly promote the "complex life content" given to him by bourgeois "sages." He will certainly make a big fuss in the "annotations" of "honeysuckle plants," "new members of the black gang"... He will give us more negative lessons. If you don't believe it, wait and see.

### 自己跳出来的反面教员

    自己跳出来的反面教员
                          伍丁
    平心先生三月三十一日在《文汇报》发表的文章①，充满了对批评者刻骨的阶级仇恨。这是《海瑞罢官》讨论以来最赤裸裸地暴露出某些“学者”“教授”真实面目的一篇文章。这是自己跳出来的、不可多得的反面教员。希望同志们花点时间耐心地读一读，它可以擦亮许多人的眼睛。它可以有力地驳掉什么“辩论进行得差不多了”“斗争快告一段落了”之类的观点，它可以生动地教育人们认识眼前正在进行着的是一场多么尖锐、剧烈而深刻的阶级斗争，它可以使得某些平心先生的“同事”和“朋友”看清楚好心奉劝平心先生会得到什么结果，它告诉政治、思想战线上一切革命的人们切不可丝毫松懈自己的斗志。
    平心先生用尽了一切辱骂的词汇。什么“思绪敏而无功言辞利而无力”，什么“喷以唾沫”，什么“挥翰手兼弓箭手”，什么“无原则无标准地砍以巨斧”，什么“从暗角里射出了一支看似锋利谲狯实则难穿鲁缟的秃箭”，什么“飕的一声吹起一阵摧林拔木的暴风”，什么要把“园丁手莳的满园新苗一下子刮进溷坑”，什么“一律打进四万由旬的阿鼻地狱”，什么“头脑中设计的破帽”，什么“视民如仇”，什么“新黑帮分子”……凡是他想得出来的刻毒词汇，他都用上了。只有对这场讨论抱有深仇大恨的人，才会用这种语言来发泄内心的感情。请同志们、朋友们想一想：平心先生究竟站到什么立场上去呢？
    为什么平心先生要这样暴跳呢？这是因为两篇极短的文章刺中了他的痛处。平心先生其实并无意于进行什么“清官”讨论，他不过利用这次讨论来达到他另外的目的。他希望别人跟着他所开列的一大堆“循吏”名单“旋转”，走进烦琐讨论的迷魂阵去，弄得头昏脑胀，不去揭露吴晗反党反社会主义的反动本质和反动思想，离开这场尖锐的政治斗争和思想斗争的主要目标，使我们迷失方向。这也是配合吴晗进攻的一种战术。然而批评文章偏不“绕着”他提出的问题“旋转”，一下子就挑出了他别有用心地安插进去的“忍冬科植物”，揭出了他是想借此宣扬“清官”万古长青，于是他觉得面上很不光彩，就跳起来。其实，这恰好证明了原来批评者是切中要害的。如果他真正想讨论什么“比较重要的问题”，难道还会在这个“个别字眼”上费尽九牛二虎之力来反驳一段“言辞利而无力”的话吗？
    平心先生自己揭露了自己。他辱骂对方是“弓箭手”，就承认了自己是箭靶子，承认了自己是站在这次讨论的对立面。他说别人的批评几句话就“吹起一阵摧林拔木的暴风”，就承认了他的外强中干，虽然样子那么凶，其实骨子里是脆弱的，一点点风吹草动就当作“暴风”。他咒骂别人批评他就是要把“园丁手莳的满园新苗”“刮进溷坑”，则正好告诉了我们：他这位“园丁”确实很想在社会主义的土地上培养出一批资本主义的“新苗”（包括以“忍冬科”面目出现的“清官”）。他渴望这批“新苗”大长特长，他自命为保护这批“新苗”的园丁。“为了对当前的革命负责”，我们难道还不应进一步分析，平心先生历来手莳的“新苗”究竟是一些什么品种、它的根子究竟在哪里么？平心先生曾经咒骂“农民只是颠扑在绝望的叛乱与惨酷的失败中”“人民蠕动在死水般的愚昧精神生活中”②，把伟大的中国人民歪曲成象虫一样“愚昧”地“蠕动”，这些东西难道不应当拿出来见见太阳吗？
    平心先生使用这样刻骨仇恨的语言，并不是偶然的。他在解放以后出版的历史著作中，就使用过“共党分子”、“共派”这种敌人使用的词汇咒骂共产党。说什么一九二七年之后“共党分子”“于各地发动土地革命，是为今日赤军内战之源流”；又说什么“共党”“武装了一部分农民，这就成为日后赤军反乱的源流”。他这样吹捧染满人民鲜血的蒋介石反革命政府：“后来北京与天津为党军收复了……全国都飘着青天白日旗，张学良亦表示信仰三民主义，服从国民政府了”。③你看，共产党领导的伟大的农民革命战争叫做“反乱”，国民党反动派的反革命事业叫做“收复”，平心先生这位“教授”的阶级立场不是清清楚楚么？懂得这一点，看见今天平心先生咒骂什么“新黑帮分子”……之类，就毫不感觉奇怪了。
    平心先生这回还对“我校的几位同事”和“朋友”进行讽刺，表示“可惜”和“失望”。为什么要带上这一笔？这是因为他的“同事”和“朋友”认识提高了，不同意他的两条标准论，使他很不高兴。你看：平心先生是碰不得的，连你好心好意帮他忙，他也要拒绝。平心先生要这样做，自然有他的自由，但平心先生的“朋友”和“同事”，难道不应当从这件事中进一步看清他的灵魂吗？
    “讨论可以结束了”吗？不，不但对吴晗反党反社会主义言行的批判还需要深入，就是平心先生也还准备一篇一篇地写下去呢！上一篇文章他在注解中写道：“将来打算以专文进一步论述”；这一篇文章又声明“只能在别篇专论中申述”。他越来越长、越来越“专”的“专文”和“专论”要写多少篇，谁也不清楚。但是，有一点是清楚的：他不会执行什么“让步政策”，而坚持执行进攻政策。在《学术月刊》和《文汇报》上发表的他的文章中，平心先生两次提出反“左”倾的口号。他很注意从政治上发动进攻，把目前对吴晗的批判加上一个“‘左’倾机会主义”的罪名，从根本上加以否定。请同志们注意：现在有一些反共知识分子和他们的代理人，别有用心地把这场反对资本主义复辟、保卫社会主义和无产阶级专政的大论战、大革命，扣上一顶“‘左’倾机会主义”的帽子，平心先生凭着他的阶级敏感，一再喊出了这个口号，应当引起我们高度的警惕。这次他又提出历史科学“有鲜明的阶级内容和复杂的生活内容”，这个“复杂的生活内容”，是用来修正和取消“鲜明的阶级内容”的，它就是同马克思主义阶级斗争学说针锋相对的资产阶级的人性论和资产阶级的社会学。阶级斗争存在是不以人们意志为转移的客观规律。有人很想走过场了事，平心先生等却偏要起而攻击。有些人很想争论少一些尖锐性，平心先生等却偏要弄得版面上充满火药味。这有什么办法呢！看来，这不是一场速决战，而可能是一场持久战。不久总有一个更大的文化革命高潮要到来，现在已经可以听见奔腾的潮声了！一切革命的人们，正在举起双手热烈欢迎它！
    平心先生自以为有两个法宝，可以万无一失。一是所谓“我过去领教过多次了”，他以为过去讨论“生产力论”以及别的争论中使用过“多次”的老战术，也可以用到这场论争中来：反正不管有理无理，我横一篇竖一篇写出来，看你们怎么办。弄得大家都疲塌了，都不想看这种文章了；我还在写，直写到“最后一天”，我就算“胜利”了。二是死抱住星宇同志“清官”论作挡箭牌，不但上一篇文章用，这一篇文章更加气势汹汹地威胁道：“请问要不要列举证据？”你再敢批评平心吗？他一“列举证据”，连“深刻批判吴晗同志”的文章都要垮台了。但是，我们可以坦率地正告平心先生，天是塌不下来的，彻底的唯物主义者决不怕面对真理，决心要彻底揭露一切反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的东西，何况一个“清官”问题？谁是谁非，在论战中终将弄清楚，你有你自己的一套，死抱住别人是不行的。不要自以为抓到了一个救生圈，也许只是一根烂稻草，那怎么办呢？还是自己说自己心里的真话为好。至于你“多次”使用过的老办法，这次效果如何，尚待证明。我们很欢迎平心先生继续写文章参加讨论，以便在实践中证明：这次讨论的结果同平心先生得意地夸耀的以前“多次”讨论，是否相同。
    上海是无产阶级和资产阶级都最集中的地方。解放以来，无产阶级同资产阶级历次重大的斗争，许多是在上海爆发的。资产阶级的本性是一样的。但由于上海解放前长期受帝国主义直接控制，是“十里洋场”，上海的资产阶级比起北方来更带一些“洋”气。这个特点也反映到知识界。有人在“清官”讨论中提出什么希奇古怪的“洋清官”来，似乎连屠杀、欺骗人民的反动官僚也是“洋货”好，即为一例。鲁迅曾经批评过上海某些资产阶级知识分子是“洋场恶少”，就是针对他们的洋奴和流氓习气。为什么一个以“学者”“历史唯物主义”者自命的平心先生，会写出那些不堪入目的字眼来呢？这固然要从平心先生的阶级感情中去找原因，但同时也要从上海资产阶级的特性中去找原因。这就可以使我们更深刻地懂得什么叫阶级斗争。平心先生写过一本《人民文豪鲁迅》，书里吹嘘自己是什么“少壮斗士”，“很幸运地自幼就接触到世界思潮”也就是“欧美革命大师与民主先哲的文献”④。把伟大的革命战士鲁迅胡乱戴上一顶西洋“文豪”的帽子，这已经反映出平心先生对资产阶级洋“文豪”是多么神往了；以接受美国资产阶级“先哲”的学说为“幸运”，更是活活刻划出一副拜倒在西方资产阶级脚下的样子。这正是崇拜腐朽的“西方文明”的资产阶级的性格。平心先生是决不会沉默的。他当然还要发言。他当然还要宣传资产阶级“先哲”所赐给他的“复杂的生活内容”。他当然还要在“忍冬科”“新黑帮分子”……之类的“注解”中大做文章。他还会给予我们更多反面的教益。谓予不信，拭目以待。
