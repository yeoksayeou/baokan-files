    The People's Country is Forged of Iron; Anti-Party Elements Will Not Succeed
    In the old society, we poor folks tasted all the bitterness, spiciness, and sourness, but never any sweetness. Only with the leadership of the Party did the people stand up. Anti-Party elements want us to return to bitterness; that will absolutely not happen.
    Meng Tai, Delegate to the National People's Congress, Vice Chairman of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Trade Union

    When I heard Deng Tuo and his gang using some kind of coded language to attack the great Chinese Communist Party and our beloved Chairman Mao, I was so angry my lungs almost burst! We must eradicate this black line, smash this black den, and achieve a complete and thorough victory in our country's socialist cultural revolution.

    This gang of bad elements, headed by Deng Tuo, attacked our Party's leadership for being "self-righteous and looking down on the masses," and slandered our Party for "going back on its word" and being "untrustworthy." They also viciously attacked Chairman Mao's scientific judgment that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, calling it "grand empty talk" and "clichés." To put it bluntly, these lies are meant to overthrow the great Communist Party and our beloved Chairman Mao. This is outrageous! I absolutely will not allow it. The hundreds of thousands of workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Works absolutely will not allow it. The working class of our country absolutely will not allow it. Whoever attacks our great Communist Party, whoever attacks our great savior—our beloved Chairman Mao—we will fight them to the end, bashing their heads until they are completely crushed.

    Without the Communist Party, without Chairman Mao, there would be no New China, no today. In the old society, we poor folks generation after generation tasted bitterness, spiciness, and sourness, but never any sweetness. Under the wise leadership of the great Communist Party and our beloved Chairman Mao, our proletariat was liberated, stood up, and became the masters of New China. Our country independently manufactured the atomic bomb, and the recent nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear material was also successful. We have also manufactured a 12,000-ton hydraulic press, electronic computers, airplanes, and so on—the list is endless. These things that we dared not even imagine in the old society have actually become reality, and isn't that due to the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao? Faced with these lively and vibrant facts, Deng Tuo, why are you lying through your teeth? The fundamental issue is that you are not of one heart with us workers, not sitting in the same boat. You are a representative of the bourgeoisie and landlords, a representative of Khrushchev revisionism. You viciously attack our great Party, viciously attack our great leader Chairman Mao, precisely because the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the great saviors of our proletariat. Your attempt to make us return to bitterness, to overthrow the ironclad country bought with the blood of millions of martyrs, is wishful thinking and absolutely will not succeed!

    From which bowstring were these poisonous arrows attacking the great Communist Party and our beloved Chairman Mao launched? They were shot from the three bowstrings of *Qianxian*, *Beijing Ribao*, and *Beijing Wanbao*. Even more noteworthy is that *Beijing Ribao* published a batch of materials across three pages on April 16, under the banner headline *Criticism of the "Three-Family Village" and "Yanshan Yuhua"*, and published an editor's note from *Qianxian* and *Beijing Ribao*. This editor's note was to cover up for Deng Tuo and this small group of anti-Party, anti-socialist elements. All in all, you are still wearing the same pants as Deng Tuo, speaking with one voice, which is truly infuriating. May I ask *Qianxian* and *Beijing Ribao*, on whose side are you standing? For whom are you running the newspaper? I urge you to return to the position of the proletariat and conduct a serious and thorough self-examination. Otherwise, the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Works will not forgive you, the working class of China will not forgive you, the people of China will not forgive you.

    人民江山铁打成  反党分子不得逞
    在旧社会，我们穷哥儿尝尽了苦辣酸，就是没有甜的滋味。有了党的领导，人民才翻了身，反党分子要我们重新回到苦水里去，绝对办不到
    全国人民代表大会代表、鞍钢工会副主席　孟泰
    当我听到邓拓和他的一伙人，用什么黑话攻击伟大的中国共产党和敬爱的毛主席，我简直肺都要气“炸”了。我们一定要铲掉这根黑线、砸碎这家黑店，一定要取得我国社会主义文化大革命的完全、彻底的胜利。
    以邓拓为头目的这帮坏家伙，攻击我们党的领导“自作聪明，看不起群众”，又污蔑我们党“自食其言”，“不堪信任”，还恶毒地攻击毛主席东风压倒西风的科学论断，是“伟大的空话”，是“陈词滥调”。这些鬼话拆穿了，就是要推翻伟大的共产党，就是要推翻敬爱的毛主席。这还了得！我绝对不允许，鞍钢十几万工人绝对不允许，我国工人阶级绝对不允许。谁攻击我们伟大的共产党，谁攻击我们伟大的救星——敬爱的毛主席，我们一定同他们拼到底，让他碰得头破血流，直至彻底粉碎。
    没有共产党，没有毛主席，就没有新中国，就没有今天。在旧社会，我们穷哥们祖祖辈辈尝尽了苦、辣、酸，就是没有甜的滋味。在伟大的共产党、敬爱的毛主席的英明领导下，我们无产阶级才获得了解放，翻了身，成为新中国的主人翁。我国自力更生地制造成功了原子弹，最近进行的含有热核材料的核爆炸也成功了。我们还制造了一万二千吨水压机、电子计算机、飞机，等等，简直说不完。这些在旧社会连想都不敢想的事，居然成了现实，还不是由于共产党和毛主席的英明领导吗？面对着这些活蹦乱跳的事实，邓拓你为什么瞪着眼睛说瞎话呢？根本问题是和咱工人不一条心，不坐在一条船上。你就是资产阶级、大地主的代表，你就是赫鲁晓夫修正主义的代表。你恶毒地攻击我们伟大的党，恶毒地攻击我们伟大领袖毛主席，就是因为共产党、毛主席是我们无产阶级的大救星。你企图让我们重新回到苦水里去，推翻千百万烈士鲜血换来的铁打的江山，这是妄想，绝对办不到！
    这些攻击伟大的共产党、攻击敬爱的毛主席的毒箭，是从那个弦放出来的呢？是从《前线》、《北京日报》、《北京晚报》这三条弦上射出来的。更值得注意的是《北京日报》在四月十六日以三个版的篇幅，在《关于“三家村”和〈燕山夜话〉的批判》这个通栏大标题下，发表了一批材料，并发表了《前线》、《北京日报》的编者按。这个编者按，就是替邓拓这一小撮反党反社会主义分子打掩护。说来说去，你们还是和邓拓穿一条裤子，一个鼻孔出气，这实在太使人气愤了。请问《前线》《北京日报》，你们站在什么立场上？你们为谁办报？我劝你们，应该回到无产阶级的立场上，进行认真、彻底的检查。不然鞍钢工人不能饶恕你们，中国工人阶级不能饶恕你们，中国人民不能饶恕你们。
