    Promote Production with Revolution, Production Soars Higher
    Albanian People Successfully Complete First Quarter National Plan
    Broad Masses of People Respond to Party and Government's Call to Launch a Nationwide Upsurge in Vigorously Developing Agricultural Production
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 2nd – The Albanian people have successfully completed the national economic plan for the first quarter. This shows that a series of revolutionary measures recently adopted by the Central Committee of the Labor Party and the government have achieved remarkable results.
    A communique on the implementation of the national plan for the first quarter of this year, published by the Albanian Bureau of Statistics on April 30, pointed out that Albanian industrial and agricultural workers have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Labor Party and the government, and have launched a production upsurge to successfully complete the national plan. The communique pointed out that the total industrial output value plan for the first quarter was completed by 105%, and the industrial output value increased by 16% compared with the same period last year.
    Agricultural workers have carried out spring planting work on time and with high quality, and have made great achievements in reclaiming wasteland and expanding the sown area. The communique pointed out that the wasteland that has been reclaimed in the first quarter is 2.4 times that of the same period last year. According to preliminary statistics as of April 23, the cultivated area has been expanded by 6% compared with the same period last year; the sown area has been expanded by 49%, of which the potato sown area is 4.6 times that of the same period last year, cotton is about 3 times, and tobacco is about 2 times.
    The communique pointed out that in terms of freight transportation, the turnover of road freight (calculated in ton-kilometers) in the first quarter completed 105% of the plan (12% of the same period last year); the turnover of long-distance shipping freight completed 108% of the plan (18% of the same period last year).
    Enterprises affiliated to the Ministry of Construction completed 104% of the construction plan, and the amount of construction increased by 8% compared with the same period last year.
    The goods sold by the socialist commercial sector in the first quarter of this year increased compared with the same period last year, including: vegetables increased by 41%, meat and meat products - 19%, oils - 13%, sugar - 15%, milk - 24%, eggs - 18%, rice - 12%, cotton cloth - 21%.
    The communique issued by the Bureau of Statistics pointed out that the achievements made in the first quarter clearly demonstrate the high enthusiasm of the Albanian working people and the correct leadership of the Albanian Labor Party. These achievements have effectively promoted the implementation of the 1966 national plan.
    This newspaper reported that the solemn call of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and the Council of Ministers to the people of the whole country to vigorously develop agricultural production, strive to increase grain production, and strive to achieve self-sufficiency in grain during the new five-year plan has immediately aroused enthusiastic response throughout the country. An upsurge of the whole party and the whole people vigorously developing agricultural production is unfolding throughout Albania.
    The call of the Party Central Committee and the Council of Ministers, like a spring thunder, mobilized the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of people. First of all, the peasants turned winter leisure into winter busy, building terraces, reclaiming wasteland, accumulating fertilizer, and repairing water conservancy, making full preparations for striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture in 1966. Now, the broad masses of peasants are throwing themselves into the tense spring ploughing production with great energy.
    In order to realize the call of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, employees in all walks of life and the broad masses of urban residents across the country have carried forward the revolutionary spirit, gone all out, and vigorously supported agricultural production. In this upsurge, the working class took the lead. They carried out labor competitions, striving to increase the production of a large number of agricultural machinery and irrigation equipment to meet the needs of large-scale terrace repairs, wasteland reclamation, and water conservancy construction in rural areas. At present, factories and mining enterprises across the country are also carrying out a "one-on-one" movement, that is, one factory is linked to the same agricultural cooperative, helping the cooperative to repair agricultural machinery and irrigation equipment; during the busy farming season, workers are also transferred to help the cooperative with field work.
    In order to strengthen the agricultural production front, about 5,000 volunteers across Albania have responded to the Party's call to settle in rural areas. The peasants affectionately call them "the first batch of spring swallows in 1966." Among them are leading party and government cadres, representatives of the People's Assembly, officers and soldiers of the People's Army, agricultural experts, medical workers, technicians, literary and art workers, young people who are determined to work in rural areas, and urban employees who have returned to the agricultural front. Now, there is still a large number of volunteers who are preparing to go to the front line of agriculture.
    In Albania, the spring of 1966 is an extraordinary spring. Under the correct leadership of the Labor Party, the heroic Albanian people are advancing victoriously on the agricultural front. (Attached picture)

    以革命促生产，生产更加高涨
    阿尔巴尼亚人民出色完成首季国家计划
    广大人民响应党和政府的号召掀起全民大力发展农业生产热潮
    新华社地拉那二日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民已经出色地完成了第一季度的国民经济计划。这表明，劳动党中央和政府最近以来所采取的一系列革命化措施，已获得了显著的成果。
    阿尔巴尼亚统计局四月三十日发表的今年第一季度国家计划执行情况的公报指出，阿尔巴尼亚工农业劳动者热烈响应劳动党和政府的号召，掀起了出色完成国家计划的生产热潮。公报指出，第一季度的工业总产值计划完成了百分之一百零五，工业产值比去年同期增加了百分之十六。
    农业劳动者按期和高质量地进行了春播工作，在开垦荒地、扩大播种面积方面取得了很大的成绩。公报指出，在第一季度中，已经开垦的荒地为去年同期的二点四倍。根据到四月二十三日为止的初步统计，耕地面积比去年同期扩大了百分之六；播种面积扩大了百分之四十九，其中土豆播种面积为去年同期的四点六倍，棉花约为三倍，烟草约为两倍。
    公报指出，在货运方面，第一季度的公路货运周转量（按吨公里计算）完成了计划的百分之一百零五（为去年同期的百分之十二）；长途航运货运周转量完成了计划的百分之一百零八（为去年同期的百分之十八）。
    建筑部所属的企业完成了建筑计划的百分之一百零四，建筑量比去年同期增加百分之八。
    今年第一季度社会主义商业部门出售的商品，比去年同期有了增加，其中：蔬菜增加百分之四十一，肉类和肉类制品——百分之十九，油脂——百分之十三，糖——百分之十五，牛奶——百分之二十四，蛋类——百分之十八，大米——百分之十二，棉布——百分之二十一。
    统计局发表的这个公报指出，第一季度所取得的成就，清楚地证明了阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民的高涨热情和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导。这些成就有效地推动着一九六六年国家计划的执行。
    本报讯　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会和部长会议向全国人民发出的大力发展农业生产，努力增产粮食，争取在新的五年计划期间达到粮食自给的庄严号召，立即在全国各地引起了热烈的响应。一个全党全民大力发展农业生产的热潮，正在整个阿尔巴尼亚展开。
    党中央和部长会议的号召，象一声春雷调动了广大人民的生产积极性。首先是农民，他们变冬闲为冬忙，修梯田、开荒地、积肥料、修水利，为争取一九六六年的农业丰收，做好充分的准备。现在，广大农民正以巨大的干劲投入紧张的春耕生产。
    为实现劳动党中央的号召，阿尔巴尼亚全国各行各业的职工和广大城市居民发扬了革命精神，全力以赴，大力支援农业生产。在这个热潮中，工人阶级一马当先。他们开展劳动竞赛，努力增产大量的农业机械和灌溉设备，以满足农村大修梯田、开荒和兴修水利的需要。全国各厂矿企业目前还在开展一个“一帮一”的运动，即一个工厂同一个农业社挂钩，帮助这个社修理农业机械、灌溉设备；在农忙时还抽调工人帮助合作社进行田间劳动。
    为了加强农业生产战线，阿尔巴尼亚全国已约有五千名志愿人员响应党的号召到农村安家落户。农民们亲切地称他们为“一九六六年的第一批春燕”。他们当中有党政领导干部，人民议会代表、人民军官兵、农业专家、医务工作者、技术人员、文艺工作者、志在农村的青年和重返农业战线的城市职工。现在，还有大批志愿人员正在整装待发，奔赴农业第一线。
    在阿尔巴尼亚，一九六六年的春天是个不平凡的春天。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党的正确领导下，正在农业战线上胜利前进。（附图片）
