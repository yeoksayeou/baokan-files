    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 18th. According to a broadcast from Radio Pathet Lao, a memorandum issued by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party on the 17th pointed out that the great victories of the Lao military and civilians in destroying U.S. aircraft over the past two years have dealt a heavy blow to the "U.S. air superiority" that U.S. imperialism and its running dogs have long used to deceive and boast about. "This victory also proves that although U.S. imperialism has powerful weapons and dollars and is very ferocious, it is not scary. The united strength of the people will surely be able to defeat them."
    The memorandum stated: "U.S. imperialism and its running dogs believed that U.S. aircraft, artillery shells, and barbaric killing weapons could help them escape their fate of defeat and subdue the Lao people. This is nothing more than wishful thinking. The two years that U.S. imperialism dispatched its air force to commit monstrous crimes were also two years in which the Lao people became even more indignant and determined to strongly oppose them." "Over the past two years, while repelling a series of nibbling offensives by the Vientiane puppet army's infantry and artillery, coordinated by Thai infantry and artillery, and under the command of U.S. military 'advisors,' the military and civilians of the liberated areas used various weapons to shoot down more than 370 U.S. bandit aircraft, most of which were new-type jet aircraft of various types, and wounded hundreds more, capturing many U.S. and lackey pilots."
    This memorandum was issued by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party on the second anniversary (May 17, 1966) of the U.S. brazenly directly dispatching its air force to bomb the Lao liberated areas.
    The memorandum pointed out that in 1964, facing repeated defeats on the Lao battlefield and increasingly mired in difficulties in South Vietnam, U.S. imperialism openly risked strengthening its "special war" in Laos. From that time on, U.S. T-28, Skyraider, and other propeller aircraft and F-100, F-101, F-102, F-105, F-4H, B-57 and other modern jet aircraft, piloted by American, Thai, and Taiwanese pilots, took off from U.S. air bases in Thailand and South Vietnam and the U.S. Seventh Fleet, continuously and frantically bombing and strafing the Lao liberated areas from north to south.
      "The aforementioned bombing and strafing went from occurring every few days to continuously every day; from daytime to nighttime; from five or ten sorties per day to massively increasing to forty or fifty sorties, and even hundreds of sorties against one location (such as the bombing of the Phou Khout Mountain area on March 14 this year); from hundreds of sorties per month to thousands of sorties (such as 2,075 sorties in the first two months of this year)."
    The U.S. Air Force indiscriminately bombed densely populated towns and facilities for cultural, social, and religious activities, such as schools, hospitals, and temples. U.S. aircraft went from using ordinary shells, cluster bombs, time bombs, and rockets to weapons of mass destruction such as napalm, phosphorus bombs, and even prohibited chemical poisons.
    U.S. imperialism, disregarding international law, also brazenly dispatched aircraft on numerous occasions to attack foreign diplomatic missions in Laos, such as the economic and cultural representative offices of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Kang Kai, and the Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in Phong Saly.
    In the two years since May 17, 1964, U.S. imperialism has used its air force to massacre many innocent people in the liberated areas, burn down hundreds of villages, towns, and temples, and thousands of houses, and burn countless crops. "U.S. imperialism not only seriously undermined the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos, crudely trampled on Laos' sovereignty and independence, and disregarded the most basic principles of international law, but also proved that it is the most brutal and barbaric imperialist colonialist of our time."
    The memorandum strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for constantly instigating its running dogs in Laos to fabricate false evidence to slander the Lao Patriotic Front Party and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in order to deceive public opinion and cover up its crimes. The memorandum pointed out that the Lao right-wing elements and Prince Souvanna Phouma played the role of accomplices with the U.S. aggressor bandits. The memorandum emphasized that this was an extremely serious crime of "inviting the wolf into the house."
    The memorandum also pointed out that the mortally wounded beast—U.S. imperialism—is becoming more frantic and reckless as it suffers more defeats. It is actively preparing to dispatch its army to invade central and lower Laos. In order to realize this dangerous conspiracy, U.S. Air Force bombings and strafing of the Lao liberated areas, especially the central and lower Lao regions, have recently increased unprecedentedly. Even more barbaric is that, since the beginning of April 1966, U.S. imperialism has repeatedly dispatched B-52 strategic bombers to drop thousands of tons of bombs on many residential areas in Khammouane and Savannakhet provinces in central Laos and Saravane province in lower Laos. This is an extremely serious "escalation" of the war of aggression and an action to intensify and expand their "special war" against Laos to a new scale. "It is clear that the authorities in Washington have fully exposed the bestiality more brutal than the Hitler fascist group."
    The memorandum stated that the Lao Patriotic Front Party and all the Lao people strongly accuse, protest, and condemn the above-mentioned crimes of U.S. imperialism to world opinion; demand that the authorities in Washington immediately stop the bandit attacks on the Lao liberated areas by aircraft, stop the war of aggression against Laos, and thoroughly respect and strictly implement the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos.
    The memorandum also sternly warned the Bangkok government and the Saigon regime: If they stubbornly follow U.S. imperialism and continue to hand over Thailand and South Vietnam to U.S. imperialism as bases for launching attacks on the Lao liberated areas, they will inevitably not escape the deserved punishment from the Lao people, the Thai people, and the Vietnamese people, who are supported by the people of Asia and the world. The memorandum called on the participating countries of the 1961-1962 Geneva Conference on Laos, the governments of all peace-loving countries, and the peace-loving and just-minded people of the world, including the American people, to take timely and active actions to stop U.S. imperialism from committing heinous crimes on Lao soil using its air force, and to further strongly support the Lao people who are waging a just struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.
    The memorandum finally expressed its determination to resolutely realize the ironclad vow made in the declaration of the Lao National Political Consultative Conference held in October 1965: "No matter how stubborn and ferocious U.S. imperialism is, our people will never fear hardship or sacrifice, and will fight for a long time, fight to the end, and thoroughly defeat its interference and aggression."
    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 18th. According to a broadcast from Radio Pathet Lao, the Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army issued a statement on the 2nd anniversary (May 17th) of U.S. imperialism directly dispatching its air force to bomb the Lao liberated areas, stating: "U.S. imperialism's two years of dispatching its air force to attack and kill our people does not prove that U.S. imperialism is strong, it only proves that it is weak, defeated, and passive in the face of our military and civilians' self-defense battles to protect the liberated areas."
    The statement said that over the past two years, despite the fact that U.S. imperialism and its Lao running dogs and Souvanna Phouma have continuously strengthened and expanded the "special war" in Laos, the Lao patriotic military and civilians' struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation is still vigorously developing, and our military and civilians are not afraid at all. The more they strengthen the "special war" and use their air force to conduct fierce attacks, the more experienced, resourceful, and courageous the Lao patriotic military and civilians become in fighting against them.
    The statement said: "Because our air defense work is done well, and because the cadres and soldiers of our main forces, local forces, and militia guerrillas who hunt enemy aircraft with light weapons have a spirit of heroic combat, we have shattered U.S. imperialism's 'air superiority,' making it impossible for U.S. aircraft to save the lives of the puppet troops and bandits or boost their morale. On the contrary, U.S. imperialism's so-called new-type aircraft have become transport planes for our engineering soldiers to transport bombs to repair roads. On the other hand, harboring hatred for the U.S. bandits and their gang and possessing a heroic spirit, our people still calmly live, produce, develop the economy, contribute to the construction of the liberated areas, and resolutely serve the front lines." The statement pointed out that from May 19, 1964, to May 10 of this year, the Lao military and civilians have shot down more than 370 U.S. aircraft, damaged hundreds, and captured many U.S. pilots. From the beginning of 1964 to April of this year, the Lao People's Liberation Army, patriotic forces, and people have also eliminated 23,272 enemies who were "sweeping" and attacking the liberated areas, including 10,929 killed, 5,042 captured, and 3,561 enemies surrendered; and seized a large number of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies. The Lao patriotic military and civilians have recently smashed the U.S. imperialism's and its running dogs' attacks on the liberated areas, eliminated many bandit gangs, recovered many liberated areas that they had nibbled away in the past, and firmly defended various strategic strongholds such as the Phou Khout Mountain area, etc.
    The statement pointed out that this victory shows that: "No matter how many modern weapons and war tools U.S. imperialism and its running dogs have, no matter how vicious, brutal, and barbaric actions they take, whether they attack us from the ground or from the sky, we can defeat them."
    The statement said that although U.S. imperialism has suffered heavy defeats, it is unwilling to give up its aggression against Laos. Therefore, the Lao patriotic military and civilians must continue to heighten their vigilance, be prepared at all times, and timely counterattack all enemy attacks, so that they will suffer even heavier defeats and win greater victories.

    老挝爱国战线党和解放军最高指挥部谴责美机轰炸解放区
    老挝军民奋战两年粉碎美国“空中优势”
    共击落美机三百七十多架，证明美帝不可怕，能够打败它
    新华社康开十八日电　据巴特寮电台广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会十七日发表的一份备忘录指出，两年来，老挝军民消灭美国飞机的重大胜利，沉重地打击了美帝国主义及其走狗长期用来欺骗和吹嘘的“美国空中优势”。“这一胜利也证明了美帝国主义虽然有强大的武器和美元，很凶恶，但并不可怕，人民的团结力量必定能够打败它们。”
    备忘录说：“美帝国主义及其走狗以为，美国的飞机、炮弹和野蛮的杀人武器可以帮助它们摆脱失败的命运，并且使老挝人民屈服。这只不过是妄想而已。美帝国主义出动空军犯下滔天罪行的两年，也是老挝人民更加义愤填膺和决心强有力地反对它们的两年。”“两年来，在打退有泰国步兵和炮兵的配合、在美国军事‘顾问’的指挥下的万象傀儡军队的步兵和炮兵的一系列蚕食进攻活动的同时，解放区军民用各种武器击落了三百七十多架美国强盗飞机，其中大部分是各种类型的新式喷气式飞机，并且击伤了数百架，俘虏了许多名美国及其仆从的飞行员。”
    这份备忘录是老挝爱国战线党中央委员会在美国悍然直接派空军轰炸老挝解放区两周年（一九六六年五月十七日）的时候发表的。
    备忘录指出，一九六四年，美帝国主义面对在老挝战场上接连遭到失败和在越南南方日益陷于困境，公然冒险地加强它在老挝的“特种战争”。从那个时候起，由美国、泰国和台湾飞行员驾驶的美国T—28型、空中袭击者式等螺旋桨飞机和F—100、F—101、F—102、F—105、F—4H、B—57型等各种现代化喷气式飞机，从泰国、南越的美国空军基地和美国第七舰队起飞，不断疯狂轰炸和扫射从北到南的老挝解放区。
      “上述轰炸和扫射从间隔多天到连续每天都进行；从白天进而晚上也进行；从每天五架、十架到大规模增加到四、五十架次，甚至对一个地方出动成百架次（如今年三月十四日对富科特山地区的轰炸）；从每月出动成百架次到成千架次（如今年头两个月出动二千零七十五架次）。”
    美国空军狂轰滥炸居民稠密的市镇以及文化、社会和宗教活动的设施，如学校、医院和庙宇等。美国飞机从使用一般的炮弹、波萝弹、定时炸弹、火箭到大规模杀人的武器如凝固汽油弹、磷质弹，甚至使用了被禁止的化学毒药。
    美帝国主义无视国际法，还悍然多次派遣飞机袭击驻老挝的外国外交代表机构如中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国驻康开的经济文化代表机构和中华人民共和国驻丰沙里总领事馆。
    从一九六四年五月十七日以来的两年中，美帝国主义用空军残杀了解放区的许多无辜人民，烧毁成百个村庄、市镇和庙寺和成千幢房屋，烧毁无数的庄稼。“美帝国主义不仅严重地破坏了一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，粗暴地践踏了老挝的主权和独立，无视国际法的最基本原则，而且还证明它是当代最残暴最野蛮的帝国主义殖民者。”
    备忘录严厉谴责美帝国主义为了欺骗舆论和掩盖它的罪行，不断地唆使它在老挝的走狗捏造假证据来污蔑老挝爱国战线党和越南民主共和国。备忘录指出，老挝右派分子和富马亲王扮演了与美国侵略强盗同伙的角色。备忘录强调说，这是极其严重的“引狼入室”的大罪。
    备忘录还指出，受到重伤的猛兽——美帝国主义越失败就越疯狂和冒险。它正在积极准备派遣它的陆军侵占中寮和下寮地区。为了实现这一危险的阴谋，美国空军最近对老挝解放区，尤其是对中寮和下寮地区的轰炸、扫射空前剧烈地增加。更加野蛮的是，从一九六六年四月初以来，美帝国主义接连出动B—52型战略轰炸机向中寮地区的甘蒙和沙湾拿吉省以及下寮地区的沙拉湾省的许多居民区投下了成千吨炸弹。这是极其严重的侵略战争的“升级”，是把它们对老挝的“特种战争”加紧进行和扩大到新的规模的行动。“很明显，华盛顿当局已经全部暴露了比希特勒法西斯集团还要残暴的兽性。”
    备忘录说，老挝爱国战线党和全体老挝人民向世界舆论强烈控诉、抗议和谴责美帝国主义的上述罪行；要求华盛顿当局立即停止用飞机对老挝解放区进行的强盗进攻，停止对老挝的侵略战争，彻底尊重和严正履行一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议。
    备忘录还严厉警告曼谷政府和西贡政权：如果它们一味追随美帝国主义，继续把泰国和南越交给美帝国主义作为对老挝解放区进行进攻的基地，那么，它们必将逃脱不了得到亚洲和全世界人民支持的老挝人民、泰国人民和越南人民所给予的应有惩罚。备忘录呼吁一九六一——一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦会议参加国、爱好和平的各国政府以及包括美国人民在内的全世界爱好和平和主持公理的人民，及时地采取积极行动，制止美帝国主义使用空军在老挝土地上犯下的滔天罪行，进一步大力支持正在进行抗美救国正义斗争的老挝人民。
    备忘录最后表示要坚决实现一九六五年十月召开的老挝全国政治协商会议的宣言中作出的钢铁誓言：“不论美帝国主义如何的顽固和凶暴，我国人民都决不怕艰苦，不畏牺牲，长期战斗，战斗到底，彻底打败它的干涉和侵略。”
    据新华社康开十八日电　据巴特寮电台广播，老挝人民解放军最高指挥部十七日就美帝国主义直接出动空军轰炸老挝解放区两周年（五月十七日）发表声明说：“美帝国主义两年来出动空军袭击和杀害我国人民并不证明美帝国主义强大，只能证明它在我国军民保卫解放区的自卫战斗面前虚弱、失败和被动而已。”
    声明说，两年来，尽管美帝国主义及其老挝走狗和梭发那·富马亲王不断加强和扩大在老挝的“特种战争”，老挝爱国军民抗美救国的斗争仍在大力发展，我国军民丝毫也不畏惧。它们越是强化“特种战争”和用空军进行剧烈的袭击，老挝爱国军民就越有经验，越加机智和勇敢地进行抗击它们的战斗。
    声明说：“由于我们的防空工作做得好，由于我们的主力部队、地方部队和用轻武器狩猎敌机的民兵游击队的干部和战士们有着英勇战斗精神，因此我们粉碎了美帝国主义的‘空中优势’，使得美国飞机挽救不了伪军和土匪的生命，振作不了它们的精神。相反，美帝国主义的所谓新式飞机却变成给我们的工兵战士运输炸弹用来修路的运输机。另一方面，由于怀着对美国强盗及其走狗集团的仇恨和有着英勇的精神，我国人民仍然沉着地生活、生产、发展经济，为建设解放区作出贡献，并坚决为前线服务。”声明指出，从一九六四年五月十九日到今年五月十日，老挝军民已击落美国飞机三百七十多架，击伤成百架，俘虏美国飞行员多名。从一九六四年初到今年四月，老挝人民解放军、爱国力量和人民还消灭了对解放区进行“扫荡”和进攻的敌人二万三千二百七十二名，其中打死一万零九百二十九名，俘虏五千零四十二名，有三千五百六十一名敌人投降；并且缴获大批武器、弹药和军用物资。老挝爱国军民最近又粉碎了美帝国主义及其走狗对解放区的进攻，消灭了许多股土匪，收复了过去被它们蚕食的许多解放区，并且牢固地保卫了各个战略据点如富科特山地区等等。
    声明指出，这一胜利表明：“无论美帝国主义及其走狗有多少现代化武器和战争工具，无论它们采取多么恶毒、残暴和野蛮的行动，无论它们是从地面上或从天空中进攻我们，我们都能够战胜它们。”
    声明说，美帝国主义虽然遭到了惨重的失败，但它是不肯放弃对老挝的侵略的。因此，老挝爱国军民要继续提高警惕，时刻作好准备，及时反击敌人的一切进攻，使它们遭到更为惨重的失败，争取更大的胜利。
