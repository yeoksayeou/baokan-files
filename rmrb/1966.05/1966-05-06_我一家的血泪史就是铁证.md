    My Family's History of Blood and Tears is Solid Proof
    Soldier of a Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army Liu Junsheng
    In a series of articles, Wu Han vigorously praised the feudal ruling class. For example, in the article "况钟和周忱" (Kuang Zhong and Zhou Chen), he said that Zhou Chen was "the most capable and good official," "didn't put on bureaucratic airs, was familiar with the people, like family," and "talked about everyday matters face-to-face with farmers, chatted, asked what difficulties and problems they had, and helped with ideas." This kind of argument played the role of reconciling class contradictions and diverting the people's line of struggle, meeting the needs of right-leaning opportunists.
    This is a pure reversal of black and white. We have never heard of such a good official in feudal society. Those bureaucratic landlords, comprador bourgeoisie, and their representatives are the people's deadly enemies, a group of bloodthirsty devils, a group of parasites who sit and eat and wait to be fed! My grandfather worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord for more than twenty years, never ate a full meal, and didn't know how many lashes he suffered from the landlord's whip; my uncle, at the age of fifteen, because his family couldn't make a living, followed others to work in a factory in Shanghai, and had two fingers bitten off by the capitalist's man-eating machine; my grandfather was forced by the landlord, his family was so poor that there wasn't a pot to cook in, so he had to heartlessly sell his own flesh and blood—my uncle—in exchange for two dou of red sorghum; when the Japanese devils invaded our country, my grandfather was also killed. All this was the "good deed" done by the reactionary ruling class praised by Wu Han! How could these people "talk about everyday matters face-to-face with farmers"? How could these people "ask what difficulties and problems they had, and help with ideas"? Wu Han, you can't deceive the youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We know that only the Party and Chairman Mao truly care about the masses and are one family with us.
    Wu Han thinks he is very "smart," but he is actually very stupid. We understand who our enemies are. Chairman Mao has long told us: "All warlords, bureaucrats, comprador class, landlord class, and a part of the reactionary intelligentsia attached to them who collude with imperialism are our enemies." No matter how you describe the reactionary ruling class as being wonderful, you cannot cover up the ferocious face of the reactionary ruling class, nor can you confuse our eyes. You want to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and want to bring down socialism, this is daydreaming! This can only be lifting a stone to drop it on your own feet.
    I am a soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. I must bear in mind Chairman Mao's teaching: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never be reconciled to their defeat, and they will make their last struggle... We must not relax our vigilance." I must be a hundred times more vigilant, defend the Party, defend socialism, and forever stand at the forefront of class struggle, thoroughly defeat all kinds of enemies, whether they are holding guns or not.

    我一家的血泪史就是铁证
    解放军某部战士  刘俊生
    吴晗在一系列文章中，极力赞扬封建统治阶级。例如，在《况钟和周忱》一文中，他说什么周忱是“最能干的好官”，“不摆官僚架子，和百姓熟了，象一家人一样”，“和农夫农妇面对面说家常话，谈谈心，问问有什么困难，什么问题，帮着出主意。”这种论调起了调和阶级矛盾，转移人民斗争视线作用，适应了右倾机会主义分子的需要。
    这是纯粹的颠倒黑白。我们从来还没听说过封建社会有这样的好官。那些官僚地主、买办资产阶级以及他们的代表人物是人民的死对头，是一群杀人不眨眼的魔鬼，是一群坐吃等喝的吸血虫！我的祖父给地主扛了二十多年长工，没吃过一顿饱饭，不知挨了地主多少皮鞭；我的伯父十五岁那年因家中无法生活，跟着人家到了上海工厂里做工，被资本家吃人的机器咬掉了两个手指头；我的外祖父因地主所逼，家里穷得锅底朝天，只得忍心将自己的亲骨肉——我的舅舅卖掉，换了二斗红高粱；日本鬼子侵略我国的时候，我的外祖父又被杀害了。这一切，就是吴晗所赞扬的反动统治阶级干的“好事”！这些人那能“和农夫农妇面对面说家常话”？这些人那能“问问有什么困难，什么问题，帮着出主意”？吴晗你是骗不了用毛泽东思想武装起来的青年的。我们知道，只有党和毛主席才真正关心群众，才和我们是一家人。
    吴晗自以为自己“聪明”得很，其实是愚蠢得很。我们懂得谁是我们的敌人。毛主席早就告诉我们：“一切勾结帝国主义的军阀、官僚、买办阶级、大地主阶级以及附属于他们的一部分反动知识界，是我们的敌人。”尽管你把反动统治阶级说的天花乱坠，也掩盖不了反动统治阶级的狰狞面目，也迷不住我们的眼睛。你想反对共产党的领导，想把社会主义搞垮，这是白天作梦！这只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    我是个中国人民解放军战士，我要牢记毛主席的教导：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。……我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”我要百倍地提高警惕，捍卫党、捍卫社会主义，永远站在阶级斗争的最前线，彻底击垮各式各样的敌人，不管他是拿枪的，还是不拿枪的。
