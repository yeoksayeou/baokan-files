    Missing Chairman Mao
    Soldier Zhan Xuandi
    Soldiers miss Chairman Mao,
    Practicing martial arts in wind and rain,
    Putting politics in command with a red ideology,
    Revolutionary aspirations shake the heavens and earth.
    Soldiers miss Chairman Mao,
    Patrolling and guarding without negligence,
    With clear minds and sharp eyes, we see accurately,
    Hatred is loaded into our gun barrels.
    Soldiers miss Chairman Mao,
    The four volumes of the Red Book never leave our side,
    Studying and applying them for the people,
    Our revolutionary path is clear.
    Soldiers miss Chairman Mao,
    The Party's teachings are remembered in our hearts,
    Adding strength to kill the enemy on the battlefield,
    Forever carrying the banner of revolution.
