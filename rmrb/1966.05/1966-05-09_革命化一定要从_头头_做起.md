    Revolutionization Must Start with the "Leaders"
    Our factory has studied Daqing several times in the past three years, focusing on this "ization" or that "ization," but never grasping the ideological revolutionization of leading cadres. Several reversals have made us realize: to lead others in revolution, one must first revolutionize oneself.
    We have been learning from Daqing for more than two years. During this period, we have had successful experiences and lessons of failure. Our deepest realization is: to learn from Daqing, the ideological revolutionization of the leadership team is the key.
    In July 1963, the Daqing experience was introduced to our factory. Everyone said it was good, and it had blazed a trail for China's industrialization. But after comparing, we felt that the gap was too large. At that time, we couldn’t wait to learn all of Daqing's experience at once. The road must be taken step by step, and the food must be eaten bite by bite. Learning from Daqing must also be learned little by little! The general branch committee studied for a long time and decided to first learn from Daqing's warehouse management experience of "five-five-ization." "Five-five-ization" means arranging the items in the warehouse in units of "five," which is convenient for finding and checking. This experience is very good. Several of our leading cadres went to the warehouse to work with the workers, putting all the items into stacks of five, with five stacks per grid. With everyone working together, the warehouses throughout the factory basically achieved "five-five-ization" in more than twenty days. Looking at it now, this approach was somewhat pursuing formality, and some things that should not have been "five-five-ized" were also "five-five-ized." For example, iron nails, which workers needed to use more than ten pounds at a time, were also packaged into bundles, each bundle weighing four taels, five bundles per stack, in order to achieve "five-five-ization." This was both wasteful and troublesome. Large cloth packages weighing several hundred pounds were also arranged in stacks of five, which were too big and tall, making them inconvenient to transport. These impractical methods were of course difficult to sustain, so when we left the warehouse, everything reverted to the old ways.
    The first time we learned from Daqing, we failed, but we did not accept this lesson well. Later, leaders from the bureau returned from studying in Daqing and introduced their experiences. After hearing this, we felt that Daqing's post responsibility system was good, so we decided to learn the post responsibility system. At that time, we thought that if every worker could strictly implement the "three honesties," "four strictnesses," and "four samenesses" like Daqing, the enterprise would definitely be run well. In order to truly learn this experience well, a team was established, headed by the factory director, leading cadres to go deep into the workshops, widely listen to workers' opinions, and sort and summarize the dozens of past systems with tens of thousands of words into thirty-eight articles with four hundred and seventy-one words of post responsibility system, and compiled them into rhymes, printed into booklets, one for each person. At the beginning, we went to the workshops every day to check, and the implementation was very good, which played a role. Later, several of our leading cadres went to the city for meetings and did not check, and when we came back, the post responsibility system collapsed.
    All good experiences and good systems should be combined with your own situation, taking what is useful and discarding what is not, and you should not swallow them whole or mechanically apply them. But at that time, we did not have a deep understanding of this point, so we once again engaged in formalism and took a detour.
    In the summer of 1965, several of our leading cadres and workers went to Daqing Oilfield together. After seeing and hearing it with our own eyes, we felt that we had not learned well in the first two times, mainly because we did not learn comprehensively. We decided to learn comprehensively this time. In addition to continuing to learn warehouse "five-five-ization" and the post responsibility system, we also wanted to learn civilized production, standardization and other experiences, and re-established a leading group to specifically take charge of this work. After studying for a period of time, grasping for a while, doing well for a while and badly for a while, the effect was still not very significant.
    For more than two years, we learned from Daqing three times in a row, took three detours, and suffered three times. What is the reason for this? We asked the workers for their opinions on this issue. An old worker bluntly said: "If our enterprise wants to catch up with Daqing, the factory's two leaders (secretary, factory director) must first learn from Daqing." At this time, the superior also sent a working group to help us find the reasons. After searching, we found that our factory had learned from Daqing several times, focusing on this "ization" or that "ization," but never grasping the ideological revolutionization of people, especially the ideological revolutionization of leading cadres. Some comrades described it as: "Only grasping the cloth head, thread head, but not grasping the human head, upper head, and the result was suffering."
    Why did we not grasp the human head, upper head? In the past, some of our leading cadres had an incorrect view, thinking that learning from Daqing was mainly the business of the workers. As long as the workers learned well, everything would be no problem. Therefore, we first called on the workers to learn from Daqing, but we did not learn from Daqing ourselves. As a result, we treated the head when it hurt and the foot when it hurt, and it was cold for a while and hot for a while, and we couldn't stick to it. From the surface, the leaders also worked and engaged with the workers, grasping this and that, and were also very tired. In fact, we were still afraid of hardship and fatigue, especially afraid of doing arduous ideological work, and had no confidence in catching up with Daqing. In the final analysis, we did not highlight politics and did not highlight Mao Zedong Thought. This inspection made us further realize that the opinions raised by the workers were both pertinent and reasonable. If we want to build an enterprise into a Daqing-style enterprise and bring the team into a revolutionary team, the leaders must take the lead in revolution.
    The reason why Daqing has become a national advanced model is that it highlights politics, holds high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and the leaders take the lead in creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the minds of the vast number of workers. The fourth time we learned from Daqing, we first focused on creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and using Mao Zedong Thought to transform ourselves. Several major leading cadres took the lead in studying and applying it. First, with the ideological problems of fearing hardship and fatigue, we studied articles such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and "Serve the People," and used Mao Zedong Thought to solve our own ideological problems. The leading cadres in charge of production, with the problem of why the rotary six-color automatic shuttle changing loom had not been successfully tested for several years, studied Chairman Mao's relevant articles and summarized the reasons for past failures with the technical personnel, and as a result, they succeeded in less than a month. Leading cadres took the lead in creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and quickly drove the vast masses to creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Some cadres, after studying Chairman Mao's works, took the initiative to go to the workshops to revise some impractical systems, and some moved their luggage to the workers' dormitories, stayed in the workshops, helped the teams summarize experiences, and cultivate models. In this way, the mental outlook of the workers has undergone great changes. A competition of learning from, catching up with, helping and surpassing for weaving well for the revolution and practicing hard skills for the revolution was launched vigorously. Good people and good deeds continued to appear, the post responsibility system was implemented better than in the past, production was more civilized than in the past, warehouse management was also in good order, product quality was improved, and the variety also increased.
    Several reversals have made us realize a truth: A revolutionary, to lead others in revolution, must first revolutionize oneself. If one does not revolutionize oneself, it is impossible to lead others well in revolution.

### 革命化一定要从“头头”做起

专栏：学大庆  赶大庆  超大庆  创造更多的大庆式企业

    革命化一定要从“头头”做起
    我厂三年来几次学大庆，不是抓这个“化”，就是抓那个“化”，就是没有抓领导干部的思想革命化。几次反复，使我们认识到：要领导别人革命，首先自己要革命。
    我们学大庆已经两年多了。这个期间，有成功的经验，也有失败的教训。我们体会最深的就是：要学好大庆，首先要领导班子思想革命化，这是关键的关键。
    一九六三年七月，大庆经验传到了我们厂里，大家都说好，给中国工业化闯出了一条道路。可是一对照，感到自己差距太大了，这时恨不得一下子就把大庆经验都学到手。路总是要一步一步地走，饭要一口一口地吃，学大庆也要一点一点地学呀！总支委员会研究了半天，决定先学大庆仓库管理“五五化”的经验。“五五化”就是把仓库保管的物品，按“五”字摆放起来，便于找，查点也方便。这个经验很好。我们几个领导干部都到仓库去和工人一起干，把所有的物品都搞成五个一落，五落一格。上下齐动手，干了二十多天，全厂仓库基本实现了“五五化”。这种做法，现在看是有些追求形式，有一些不应“五五化”的也“五五化”了，如铁钉子，工人一次就要领用十几斤，为了实现“五五化”也包成包，每包四两，五包一落，既造成了浪费，又增添了麻烦；大布包一个几百斤重，也五个一落，又大又高，运起来很不方便。这些不切实际的作法，当然很难坚持，因此，当我们一离开仓库，就又恢复了老样。
    第一次学大庆失败了，但是我们却没有很好接受这次的教训。之后，局里领导同志到大庆学习回来介绍经验，我们听了感到大庆岗位责任制好，又决定学岗位责任制。当时想，如果每个工人都能象大庆那样严格执行“三老”、“四严”、“四个一样”，企业一定会办好。为了真正学好这项经验，成立了一个小组，厂长挂帅，带领干部深入车间，广泛听取工人意见，把过去几十种上万字的制度，整理归纳成三十八条四百七十一个字的岗位责任制，并编成了歌诀，印成小册子，人手一本。开始，我们每天下车间检查，执行得很好，起了一些作用。后来，我们几个领导干部到市里开会，没有检查，回来岗位责任制就垮了。
    一切好经验好制度，都要结合自己的情况有所取有所舍，不能囫囵吞枣，生搬硬套。可是当时我们对这一点认识不深，结果又一次搞了形式，走了弯路。
    一九六五年夏天，我们几个领导干部和工人一起到大庆油田去了一趟，亲眼看了，亲耳听了，回来后感到前两次没有学好，主要是学的不全面，决定这次要全面学，除了继续学仓库“五五化”、岗位责任制外，还要学文明生产、规格化等经验，并重新成立了领导小组，专门负责这项工作。学了一段，抓了一气，好一阵坏一阵，效果还是不很显著。
    两年多的时间，连续三次学大庆，走了三次弯路，吃了三次苦头。这是什么原因呢？我们带着这个问题征求工人们的意见。有个老工人开门见山地说：“咱们企业要赶上大庆，工厂的两个头头（书记、厂长）先要学大庆。”这时，上级也派来了工作组，帮助我们找原因。找来找去这才发现：我厂几次学大庆，不是抓这个化，就是抓那个化，就是没有抓人的思想革命化，特别是领导干部的思想革命化。有的同志形容说：“只抓布头，线头，不抓人头、上头，结果吃了苦头。”
    为什么没有抓人头、上头呢？过去，我们有的领导干部有一种不正确的看法，认为学大庆主要是职工的事，只要职工学好了，一切都不成问题，因此我们先是号召工人学大庆，自己不学大庆，结果头疼医头，脚疼医脚，冷一阵，热一阵，坚持不下去。从表面上看，领导也和工人一起干一起搞，东抓西抓，也很累，实际上我们还是怕苦怕累，特别是怕做艰苦的思想工作，没有追赶大庆的信心。归根结蒂，还是没有突出政治，没有突出毛泽东思想。这一检查，使我们进一步认识到工人提的意见既中肯，又有道理，要想把一个企业办成大庆式企业，把队伍带成一个革命化的队伍，领导一定要带头革命。
    大庆所以成了全国先进的典型，就是突出政治，高举毛泽东思想红旗，领导带头活学活用毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装广大职工头脑。第四次学大庆，我们首先抓了活学活用毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想改造自己，几个主要领导干部带头学，带头用。首先带着怕苦怕累的思想问题，学了《愚公移山》、《为人民服务》等文章，用毛泽东思想解决自己的思想问题。管生产的领导干部，带着回转式六色自动换梭织布机为什么试验几年没成功的问题，学了毛主席有关文章，并和技术人员一起总结了过去失败的原因，结果不到一个月的时间就搞成功了。领导干部带头活学活用毛泽东思想，很快就带动了广大群众活学活用毛泽东思想。有的干部学了毛主席著作，主动下车间修改了一些不切实际的制度，有的把行李搬到了工人宿舍，下车间蹲点，帮助班组总结经验，培养典型。这样一来，职工精神面貌发生了很大变化。一个为革命织好布，为革命练硬功的比学赶帮超的竞赛，轰轰烈烈的展开了，好人好事不断出现，岗位责任制执行得比过去也好了，生产比过去更文明了，仓库管理也井井有序，产品质量提高了，品种也有了增加。
    几次反复，使我们认识到了一个真理：一个革命者，要领导别人革命，首先要自己革命，自己不革命，就不可能领导好别人革命。
