    Resolutely Knock Out the Poison Fangs of the Deng Tuo Gang
    The Deng Tuo clique of demons and monsters is spreading poison everywhere. We, the working class, will use the iron hammer in our hands to knock out the teeth of the poisonous snake and completely eradicate the toxins.
    By Ni Zhifu, Worker Engineer of Beijing Yongding Machinery Factory

    The gang of anti-Party, anti-socialist elements in "Three-Family Village" used the proletarian propaganda fronts of *Qianxian*, *Beijing Daily*, and *Beijing Evening News* to peddle black goods and spread poison against the Party and socialism.

    The Deng Tuo gang of black bandits conspired with imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries to viciously curse our great Party and great leader. When the Khrushchev revisionists flagrantly slandered Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, Deng Tuo viciously slandered the correct statement that the "East Wind" is a "benefactor" and the "West Wind" is an "enemy" as "great empty talk," "cliches," and "even the more you say it, the worse it gets." Listen carefully, how coordinated the Deng Tuo gang of black bandits is with the international reactionaries, singing in unison!

    Since childhood, I worked as a child laborer for the American devils, enduring beatings and scoldings. Not only did I have to carry barrels of foreign oil for them all day long, but my mother also suffered their cruel exploitation. My family couldn't get enough to eat or wear, and we fled from place to place. My father was forced to his death by illness because he had no way out. The American devils are our number one enemy with whom we cannot coexist. How can anyone close their eyes and blindly say this is a "cliche"? The Communist Party and Chairman Mao rescued my family from the sea of bitterness. I was educated and trained to become an engineer, and was elected as a representative of the people of Beijing, truly becoming a master of the country. The kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao is worth saying more and more, and we will never be able to express it enough for generations to come. Only the Deng Tuo gang of anti-Party, anti-socialist black bandits would slander this revolutionary truth as "great empty talk" and "even the more you say it, the worse it gets."

    Under the guidance of the great red banner of the Party's general line for socialist construction, our working class is energetically engaged in technological innovation and technological revolution. Both the variety and quality of products, as well as production efficiency, have significantly increased and improved, and many advanced products have been developed. These are living facts and a great victory of the Great Leap Forward. Whenever we mention the Great Leap Forward, we are excited and joyful, and our revolutionary enthusiasm becomes more and more intense. Only imperialism, Khrushchev revisionists, and the Deng Tuo gang of black bandits attack our Great Leap Forward as "boasting," "bragging," "voluntarism," and "false fire." See how evenly the Deng Tuo gang of black bandits breathes with the likes of Khrushchev!

    Chairman Mao taught us: "China is a large country, but it is still very poor. It will take decades to make China rich." In order to quickly change the backward face of poverty and blankness, we listen to Chairman Mao's words, strive for self-improvement, rely on our own efforts, and go all out to build socialism. This is the ambition of our working class. We will not give up until we succeed. When our country suffered natural disasters for three consecutive years and encountered temporary economic difficulties, our working class stood tall and, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, overcame one difficulty after another and achieved one victory after another. Khrushchev revisionists everywhere slandered and attacked our Great Leap Forward as a "failure" and "collapse." Deng Tuo also couldn't wait to scold us, saying that even "the belongings of an egg" were "completely destroyed." How vicious are the intentions of the Deng Tuo gang of black bandits, and how in step with the Khrushchev revisionists!

    When anti-Party, anti-socialist demons and monsters come out of their cages, they will spread poison everywhere. Chairman Mao taught us that anything reactionary will not fall if you don't strike it. Poisonous snakes specialize in using their teeth to release poison. The iron hammer in the hands of our working class can not only create a new world, but also knock out the teeth of poisonous snakes, completely eradicate toxins, and build a better socialist society. We must swing our hammers and give them a good beating, knock out the teeth of the poisonous snakes, so that they can no longer spread poison.

    *Qianxian*, *Beijing Daily*, and *Beijing Evening News* have done a great favor for the Deng Tuo gang of anti-Party elements, releasing poison hundreds of times. Today, they are again playing tricks of false criticism and true protection, attempting to cover up Deng Tuo and his ilk. In the past, you praised those bourgeois "authorities" to the skies, obeyed them in every way, set up villages and shops for them, and suppressed submissions from workers, peasants, and soldiers, forbidding them from criticizing. This proves that your position is completely anti-Party and anti-socialist, and must be thoroughly criticized.

    坚决敲掉邓拓一伙的毒牙
    邓拓这一小撮牛鬼蛇神到处放毒。我们工人阶级就要用手中的铁榔头，敲掉毒蛇的牙齿，彻底铲除毒素
    北京永定机械厂工人工程师　倪志福
    “三家村”的一伙反党反社会主义分子，利用《前线》、《北京日报》、《北京晚报》这些无产阶级宣传阵地，专门贩卖黑货，向党、向社会主义放毒。
    邓拓一伙黑帮和帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派一起，挖空心思地咒骂我们伟大的党和伟大的领袖。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者大肆污蔑毛主席关于东风压倒西风的英明论断时，邓拓却把“东风”是“恩人”、“西风”是“敌人”的正确说法，恶毒地污蔑为“伟大的空话”，“陈词滥调”，“甚至越说得多，反而越糟糕”。大家仔细地听一听，邓拓一伙黑帮和国际上的反动派一唱一和，多么有板有眼啊！
    我从小就给美国鬼子当童工，挨打受骂，成天给他们背洋油桶不说，连我的妈妈也受尽了他们的残酷剥削。一家人吃不饱，穿不暖，东奔西逃，我父亲被逼得走投无路得病死了。美国鬼子就是我们不共戴天的头号敌人，怎么能睁着眼睛，瞎说这是“陈词滥调”呢？共产党和毛主席把我们一家人从苦海里救出来。我被教育和培养成工程师，被选为北京市人民代表，真正当了国家主人。共产党和毛主席的恩情越说越爱说，越说越多，世世代代也说不尽道不完。只有邓拓那伙反党反社会主义黑帮，才把这个革命真理污蔑为“伟大的空话”，“甚至越说得多，反而越糟糕”。
    我们工人阶级在党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大红旗的指引下，意气风发地大搞技术革新和技术革命，无论是产品品种、质量，还是生产效率都显著增加和提高了，搞出来许多尖端产品。这是活生生的事实，是大跃进的伟大胜利。我们一提起来大跃进，就兴高采烈，欢欣鼓舞，革命干劲越鼓越足。独有帝国主义、赫鲁晓夫修正主义者和邓拓一伙黑帮，攻击我们的大跃进是“说大话”，是“吹牛皮”，是“唯意志论”，是“虚火上升”。请看，邓拓一伙黑帮和赫鲁晓夫之流一个鼻孔出气出得多么匀称啊！
    毛主席教导我们：“中国是一个大国，但是现在还很穷，要使中国富起来，需要几十年时间。”为了很快改变一穷二白的落后面貌，我们听毛主席的话，奋发图强，自力更生，全力以赴地建设社会主义，这是我们工人阶级的雄心壮志。不成功，不罢休。当我国连续三年遭受自然灾害，在经济上遇到暂时困难时，我们工人阶级挺直腰杆子，在毛主席的英明领导下，克服了一个又一个的困难，取得了一个又一个的胜利。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者，到处诽谤和攻击我们的大跃进“失败了”、“垮台了”。邓拓也迫不及待地骂我们，连“一个鸡蛋的家当”“全部毁掉了”。邓拓一伙黑帮的居心多么恶毒，和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者多么步调一致啊！
    反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神出了笼，他们就要到处放毒。毛主席教导我们，凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。毒蛇专门靠其牙齿放毒。我们工人阶级手里的铁榔头，既能创造新世界，又能敲掉毒蛇的牙齿，彻底铲除毒素，把社会主义社会建设得更美好。我们要抡起榔头狠狠地揍他一顿，打掉毒蛇的牙齿，叫他再也不能放毒。
    《前线》、《北京日报》、《北京晚报》为邓拓一伙反党分子帮了大忙，放了几百次毒，今天又玩弄假批判、真包庇的花招，企图掩护邓拓之流过关。过去，你们把那些资产阶级的“权威”捧上了天，百依百从，替他们设村开店，又扣压工农兵来稿来信，不准工农兵进行批判。这证明你们的立场完全是反党、反社会主义立场，必须加以彻底批判。
