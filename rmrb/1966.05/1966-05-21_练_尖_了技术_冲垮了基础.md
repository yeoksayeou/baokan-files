    Honing "Advanced" Skills, Undermining the Foundation
    Instructor Shi Heizhe, Deputy Company Commander Qin Yuanda
    In 1964, our company experienced a situation of "two ends sticking out": military skills advanced, but ideological problems also surged. Regarding this situation, can we say that we should view the errors and achievements with a one-divides-into-two perspective? In the past, some comrades always felt that everyone braved wind and rain, practiced day and night, sweated a lot, climbed many mountains, and ran many roads. After half a year of hard work, we still achieved some results!
    Since studying the spirit of the All-Army Political Work Conference, we analyzed the situation at the time and suddenly realized: at that time, we emphasized military training, which distorted our direction! The company won four first places, but lost "four firsts." If the root is not right, what achievements are there to talk about? The "achievements" gained by practicing military skills with bourgeois ideology are very dangerous, and we will suffer defeats in war. If we are to say "one divides into two," it can only be said that we turned a bad thing into a good thing, educating us to always adhere to Chairman Mao's line of army building and never turn back.
    Our company's lesson is painful. Before 1964, our company was originally a company with a good ideological foundation, strong exemplary role of party members, and good fortress role of the party branch. It was one of the six "four-good" companies promoted by the entire division. In 1964, in order to strive for excellent training results, some cadres said, "Our political and ideological foundation is almost there, it's time to focus on skills!" Some said, "Having skills makes what we say more convincing." The direction of company building began to deviate.
    In order to strive for excellence, cadres each managed their own areas, making everything subservient to skills. The company commander took the gunners of each vehicle to a city to practice shooting; the deputy company commander took the drivers of each vehicle to practice driving outside; the platoon leader took the vehicle commanders of each vehicle to practice communication; the quartermaster took all the cooks to practice digging smokeless stoves in the field all day long. A portion of the people were taken by the deputy instructor to engage in production, and a portion were taken by the instructor to guard the house, stand guard, and go on errands. The work of the party branch was weakened, normal political education could not be carried out in a timely manner, daily reading was abandoned, and ideological work was not tightly grasped. For more than four months, party and league activities could not be maintained normally. The platoon organization and party and league groups were disrupted, and mass ideological work was done very poorly. In the end, although shooting, driving, communication, and field cooking won four first places, it greatly damaged the ideological outlook and combat style of the troops. Vehicle 404 was originally a model vehicle in the regiment, the vehicle commander was a model serviceman in the company, the gunner attended the regiment representative meeting convened by the higher authorities, and the driver was a commended member of the Communist Youth League. However, because we only focused on skills and relaxed ideological work, these comrades gradually developed arrogance. Some comrades studied skills in order to find work after returning home. The comrades who stayed at home to engage in production and stand guard felt that "being good at skills gets you ahead; we're no good!" And so on, more and more ideological problems accumulated. In this way, our "four-good" company, which had been a "four-good" company for three consecutive years, went downhill. After Comrade Lin Biao put forward the instruction of highlighting politics, we became sober, strengthened political work, vigorously grasped the ideological revolutionization of people, and the outlook of the company changed.
    The serious lessons of our company have made us painfully realize that without a correct political direction, there is no soul. The harder you try, the heavier you fall. No matter how "advanced" the "advanced elements" are, they have no real combat effectiveness. Our proletarian army will always build the army through politics and fight wars through politics. Emphasizing military affairs and impacting politics essentially violates Chairman Mao's line of army building. If this develops, it will change the nature of our army. In the future, we must emphasize politics even more, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, never forget Chairman Mao's teachings, use politics to command military affairs, command everything, vigorously grasp the ideological revolutionization of people, and strive to build a company that is extremely proletarianized and extremely combat-effective.

### 练“尖”了技术  冲垮了基础

    练“尖”了技术  冲垮了基础
    指导员  史黑则  副连长  秦远大
    一九六四年，我们连出现了“两头冒尖”的情况，军事技术冒了尖，思想问题也冒了尖。对这种情况，能不能说要一分为二地看待错误和成绩？过去，有些同志总觉得，大家顶风冒雨，白天黑夜地练，汗没少流，山没少爬，路没少跑，辛辛苦苦半年，也还取得了一些成绩呀！
    自从学习全军政治工作会议精神以后，我们分析了当时的一些情况，才猛省过来：当时突出了军事训练，把我们的方向搞歪了！连里得了四项第一，却丢了“四个第一”。根子不正，还有什么成绩可谈呢？用资产阶级思想练兵取得的“成绩”，是非常危险的，一旦有了战争，是要吃败仗的。要说一分为二，只能说是变坏事为好事，教育了我们要永远坚持毛主席的建军路线，不再转向。
    我们连的教训是沉痛的。一九六四年以前，我们连本来是思想基础好、党员模范作用强、支部堡垒作用好的连队，是全师宣扬的六个四好连队之一。一九六四年，为了争取训练成绩优胜，有的干部说：“我们的政治思想基础差不多了，该突击技术了！”有的说：“有了技术说话才过硬。”连队建设的方向开始偏了。
    为了争取优胜，干部各管一摊，一切为技术让路。连长带上各车的炮长到一个城市去练射击；副连长带上各车的驾驶员到外面去练驾驶；一排长带上各车的车长练通信；司务长带上全体炊事员整天在野外练挖无烟灶。一部分人由副指导员带去生产，一部分人由指导员带着看家、站哨、出公差等。党支部工作削弱了，正常的政治教育不能及时进行，天天读废弛了，思想工作也抓得不紧了。四个多月来，党团活动不能正常坚持。排建制和党团小组打乱了，群众性的思想工作做得很差。最后，射击、驾驶、通信和野炊，虽然得了四项第一，却大大损害了部队的思想面貌和战斗作风。404车本是团里的标兵车，车长是连里的服役标兵，炮长出席过上级召开的团代表会，驾驶员是受表扬的共青团员。可是由于我们光抓技术，放松了思想工作，这些同志逐渐滋长了骄气。还有些同志钻技术，是为了回家后找工作。留在家生产、站哨的同志，就觉得：技术冒尖才吃得开，咱们不行啦！如此等等，思想问题越堆越多。就这样，我们这个连续三年的四好连走了下坡路。林彪同志提出突出政治的指示后，我们才清醒过来，加强了政治工作，大抓人的思想革命化，连队的面貌有了转变。
    我们连队的严重教训，使我们痛心地认识到，没有正确的政治方向，就没有灵魂，劲使得越大，跌的跤子越重，“尖子”再“尖”，也没有真正的战斗力。我们无产阶级的军队永远是靠政治建军，靠政治打仗。突出军事，冲击了政治，实质上是违背了毛主席的建军路线，发展下去就会使我们的军队变质。我们今后更要突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，时刻不忘毛主席的教导，用政治统帅军事，统帅一切，狠抓人的思想革命化，为建设非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的连队而努力。
