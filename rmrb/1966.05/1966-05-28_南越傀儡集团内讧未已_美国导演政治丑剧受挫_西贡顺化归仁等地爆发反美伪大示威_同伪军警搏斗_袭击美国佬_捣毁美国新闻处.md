    Xinhua News Agency, May 27th Dispatch from Saigon: While the South Vietnamese puppet Nguyen Cao Ky clique and the Nguyen Chanh Thi clique were engaged in fierce infighting, large-scale demonstrations against the Nguyen Cao Ky clique and its American masters have erupted in cities such as Saigon, Hue, and Qui Nhon in recent days.

    According to Western news agencies, anti-US puppet clique demonstrations in Saigon have continued unabated in recent days. On the 22nd, approximately five thousand Buddhists and masses held an anti-US puppet clique demonstration and engaged in fighting with two battalions of puppet troops and police who came to suppress them. The puppet troops and police released large amounts of tear gas against the demonstrators, who retaliated with stones.

    On the 24th, when the "Military-Civilian Congress" directed by the Nguyen Cao Ky-Nguyen Van Thieu puppet clique under US instruction was opening, approximately four hundred Saigon students took to the streets carrying banners opposing the Nguyen Cao Ky clique and opposing the US.

    On the 25th, over four thousand people in Saigon held two demonstrations. They advanced in the rain, holding aloft banners opposing the Nguyen Cao Ky clique and the American devils. The puppet troops and police released large amounts of tear gas against the demonstrators and fired shots into the air as a threat, attempting to disperse the demonstration, but the masses retaliated with stones.

    On the 26th, many young people set out again to demonstrate in front of the US Embassy in Saigon. After being stopped by the puppet police, they demonstrated at the Saigon Central Market.

    On the 27th, approximately five thousand Buddhists and young people continued to take to the streets to demonstrate. They clashed with puppet police who came to suppress them. Disregarding the large amounts of tear gas released by the puppet police, they retaliated with a rain of stones. The Saigon puppet clique dispatched a large number of puppet troops and police, deploying them around the US Embassy area, setting up machine guns and recoilless rifles. However, two Americans were still injured by stones.

    In Hue, on the 25th, over seven thousand people held a meeting to protest against US support for the Nguyen Cao Ky clique. In addition, one hundred university students held a hunger strike in front of the US Consulate in Hue.

    On the 26th, approximately fifteen thousand Buddhists and students held a demonstration against the Nguyen Cao Ky clique and its American masters. Demonstrating students used stones to smash almost all the windows of the US Information Service building, then broke down the door and threw books, furniture, films and other objects from the doors and windows, and finally set the building on fire.

    On the 27th, over one hundred monks and nuns held a hunger strike in front of the US Consulate in Hue.

    In Qui Nhon City, Binh Dinh Province, approximately four thousand people held a demonstration against the Nguyen Cao Ky clique on the 24th. In Nha Trang City, Khanh Hoa Province, several hundred people also held a demonstration on the 25th. (Attached pictures)

    南越傀儡集团内讧未已　美国导演政治丑剧受挫
    西贡顺化归仁等地爆发反美伪大示威
    同伪军警搏斗　袭击美国佬　捣毁美国新闻处
    新华社二十七日讯　西贡消息：在南越傀儡阮高其集团同阮正诗集团进行激烈火并的同时，近几天来，西贡、顺化、归仁等城市内爆发了大规模的反对阮高其集团和它的美国主子的示威游行。
    据西方通讯社报道，西贡市的反美伪集团的示威，近几天来一直持续不断。二十二日，大约五千名佛教徒和群众举行了反美伪集团的示威，并且同前来镇压的两个营的伪军警展开了搏斗。伪军警对示威者施放了大量的催泪瓦斯，示威者用石块进行还击。
    二十四日，当阮高其—阮文绍傀儡集团在美国指使下导演的“军民代表大会”开场的时候，大约有四百名西贡学生举着反对阮高其集团和反美的旗帜上街示威。
    二十五日，在西贡又有四千多人举行了两次示威。他们高举反对阮高其集团和美国佬的旗帜冒雨前进。伪军警对示威者施放了大量的催泪瓦斯，向空中开枪进行威胁，企图驱散示威，但是群众用石块进行还击。
    二十六日，许多青年又出发到美国驻西贡“大使馆”前面举行示威，他们在被伪警察阻止以后，又到西贡中央市场举行了示威。
    二十七日，约五千名佛教徒和青年继续上街示威。他们同前来镇压的伪警察发生冲突。他们不顾伪警察大量施放的催泪瓦斯，用雨点般的石块进行还击。西贡傀儡集团派出大批伪军警，在美国“大使馆”的周围地区布防，架起了机关枪和无后座力炮。但是仍有两个美国佬被石块打伤。
    在顺化，二十五日，有七千多名群众举行集会，抗议美国支持阮高其集团。另外还有一百名大学生在美国驻顺化领事馆前举行绝食斗争。
    二十六日，大约一万五千名佛教徒和学生举行示威，反对阮高其集团和它的美国主子。示威学生用石头把美国新闻处建筑物的窗户几乎全部砸毁，然后破门而入，把图书、家具、影片等物件从门窗里扔了出来，最后放火烧毁了这座建筑物。
    二十七日，又有一百多名僧尼在美国驻顺化的领事馆前举行了绝食斗争。
    在平定省的归仁市，约四千名群众在二十四日举行了反阮高其集团的示威。在庆和省的芽庄市，有好几百名群众也在二十五日举行了示威。（附图片）
