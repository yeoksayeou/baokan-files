    What a "Man is the creator of history"!
    Zhen Fan
    The "Frontline" inaugural editorial contains many poisons. Here, I will only discuss one issue: it promotes the idea that "man is the creator of history." This is a grave distortion of the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. This fallacy is essentially singing praises to rulers of past dynasties, a revisionist concoction aimed at restoring counter-revolution.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." Marxism has always held that history is created by the masses of the people. In class society, people are always divided into exploiting and exploited classes. It is the oppressed working people who have created the material and spiritual wealth of society with their own hands; it is they who have promoted the progress of history with their revolutionary actions. However, the "Frontline" inaugural editorial openly stands up to sing a different tune, obliterating the great historical role of the masses and deceitfully saying: "Man is the creator of history." Are the parasitic creatures of the exploiting classes, those wolves in human clothing, the creators of history? Are Chiang Kai-shek, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists the creators of history? In line with this fallacy of the "inaugural editorial," Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha, these anti-revolutionary elements, used "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" as their battlegrounds to release a large number of anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous arrows. A large part of them were shouting loudly to erect monuments to emperors, kings, generals, and ministers. They praised emperors, kings, generals, and ministers as the bright side of history, claiming they had made indelible contributions to building our motherland and had done many good things for the people! Think about it, why did they sing praises and say good things for emperors, kings, generals, and ministers who had been thrown into the garbage heap of history? Why did they complain and express indignation on behalf of the right opportunists who had been removed from office? Why did they wield "cudgels" and hold "frosty blades" to attack the Party, wanting our great Party to step down and "rest"? In a word, it was to clear the way for revisionism and all counter-revolutionaries to carry out capitalist restoration, so that people like Deng Tuo, these "miscellaneous experts," could ascend to the political throne, ride on the necks of the people, and become the "masters" of contemporary history. Look, isn't it this fallacy of "man is the creator of history" that created a "theoretical" basis for the frantic restoration activities of bourgeois "heroes"?
    We can't help but ask, why do you dare to sing a duet against us in broad daylight, right next to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, peddling your private goods? There is only one answer: your minds are deluded by the reactionary exploiting class nature, so you disregard everything and oppose Mao Zedong Thought and the people. It was you who issued "business licenses" to the "Three-Family Village" black inn and shielded and instigated the anti-revolutionary activities of Deng Tuo and his gang. Let me tell you honestly, in front of the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, all conspiracies and schemes are daydreams and are destined to go bankrupt.

### 好一个“人是历史的创造者”！

    好一个“人是历史的创造者”！
    振凡
    《前线》发刊词毒素很多，在这里，我只谈一个问题：它宣扬“人是历史的创造者”。这是对马克思列宁主义基本原理、毛泽东思想的严重篡改，这种谬论实质上是替历代统治者唱颂歌，为反革命复辟张目的修正主义货色。
    毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”。马克思主义从来认为历史是人民群众创造的。在阶级社会里，人们总是分为剥削和被剥削阶级。是被压迫的劳动人民用自己的双手创造了社会的物质和精神财富；用自己的革命行动推动了历史的前进。《前线》发刊词却公然站出来唱反调，抹煞人民群众的伟大历史作用，偷天换日地说：“人是历史的创造者”。难道剥削阶级寄生虫、那些披着人衣的豺狼是历史的创造者吗？难道蒋介石、地富反坏右是历史的创造者吗？和“发刊词”的这种谬论一脉相承，邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙这帮反革命以《前线》、《北京日报》、《北京晚报》为阵地，放出了大批反党反社会主义的毒箭。其中有很大一部分是大喊大叫为帝王将相树立纪念碑的。他们歌颂帝王将相是历史的光明面，对缔造我们祖国有不可磨灭的功勋，为人民办了很多好事！想想看，他们为什么替送进了历史垃圾堆的帝王将相歌功颂德说好话呢？为什么给被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子叫屈喊冤愤愤不平呢？为什么他们挥舞“棍棒”，手持“霜刃”向党扑来，要我们伟大的党下台“休息”呢？一句话，是为修正主义和一切反革命搞资本主义复辟鸣锣开道，以便象邓拓这类的“人”们、这些“杂家”们登上政治宝座，骑在人民脖子上，成为当代历史的“主人”。请看，不正是“人是历史的创造者”这个谬论，为资产阶级“英雄”的疯狂复辟活动创立了“理论”根据吗？！
    我们不禁要问，为什么你们胆敢在光天化日之下，在党中央、毛主席身边唱起对台戏，贩卖私货呢？答案只有一个：你们被反动的剥削阶级本性迷住了心窍，因此不顾一切地和毛泽东思想作对，和人民作对。是你们给“三家村”黑店发了“营业执照”，并包庇、怂恿了邓拓一伙的反革命活动。老实告诉你们，在用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民面前，一切阴谋打算都是作白日梦，是注定要破产的。
