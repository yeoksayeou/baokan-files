    Using Symposiums as a Cover, Engaging in Anti-Party Activities
    Deng Tuo convened an anti-Party, anti-socialist symposium to exonerate Wu Han. At the meeting, he repeatedly emphasized that political criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" should not be "uniform," attempting to lead people astray. He also encouraged people to "liberate" bourgeois "thought," not to have any "worries," and not to be afraid of having something in common with Wu Han.

    After the publication of articles by Gao Ju and He Ming in the *Liberation Army Daily* and *Guangming Daily* on May 8th, the inside story of *Beijing Daily*'s shielding of Deng Tuo's anti-Party, anti-socialist activities has been revealed. We will further expose another anti-Party, anti-socialist act committed jointly by Deng Tuo and *Beijing Daily*. On the afternoon of December 13th last year, Deng Tuo, in the name of the University Work Department of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, convened a "Symposium on the Discussion of 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' by Liberal Arts Students of Beijing Institutions of Higher Learning" at the Municipal Party Committee.
    Deng Tuo made opening and concluding remarks at the symposium, and a person in charge of *Beijing Daily* also participated. This was, in fact, an anti-Party, anti-socialist meeting to exonerate Wu Han.
    In his opening remarks, Deng Tuo intentionally told us "not to listen to anyone casually," and said extremely maliciously: "There have been cases in the past where a branch secretary said something wrong, and if you opposed him, he would label you 'anti-Party,' but in reality, it is against him." Then, although he had to say that truly listening to the Party meant listening to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, he added: "Chairman Mao has never told any of us to listen to him unconditionally, but has asked us to overcome blindness... there is no need to listen blindly." Isn't this still telling us not to listen to Chairman Mao? Is listening to Chairman Mao being blind? Does listening to the Party only mean listening to the Party Central Committee and not listening to grassroots Party organizations? Deng Tuo also said: "Yao Wenyuan's article is not a conclusion, and Comrade Wu Han is not entirely worthless."
    Deng Tuo also tried his best to defend Wu Han's political errors. At that time, a student from the Central University for Nationalities said in his speech that Wu Han's promotion of land withdrawal in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was inciting the people to engage in "individual farming" and undermine the foundation of socialism. Deng Tuo couldn't hold back and retorted: "Is that so? Was there a 'wind of individual farming' in 1959? Where?" The student replied that he had worked in a place in 1959 where there was a "wind of individual farming." Deng Tuo deliberately asked again and again "Is it really true?" The student affirmed, "Absolutely true." At this point, Deng Tuo pretended to be confused and said, "Ah! There really was such a thing, I didn't know."
    Deng Tuo repeatedly emphasized at the meeting that this great debate was an "academic issue" and "must be handled in accordance with the principle of 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend,'" and viciously attacked our great Party, saying: "In the past, the implementation of this policy was not sufficient in some places," "if a newspaper criticized someone," "the person being criticized would be knocked to the bottom of the sea." He also encouraged us to "liberate our minds, not to have worries when writing articles, not to be afraid of having something in common with Wu Han, to present the facts, reason things out, adopt a consultative attitude, not to label people, and strive to create an atmosphere for implementing the policy of 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend,' and to write whatever opinions you have." A person in charge of *Beijing Daily* also chimed in at the time, saying: "Everyone is equal before the truth." Obviously, they were using the banner of implementing the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" to ask us to "think independently," attempting to lead us astray, to make us join them in redressing the grievances of right-leaning opportunists who had been "knocked to the bottom of the sea" by the people, and also to make us join them in defending Wu Han and his ilk.
    Deng Tuo also "warned" us "to avoid lengthy and monotonous articles," his tone clearly suggesting that he felt that many newspapers' criticisms of Wu Han's problem were "lengthy" and "monotonous." The person in charge of *Beijing Daily* also repeated tirelessly that the writing "should not be generalized," "but should specifically analyze a problem, breaking through the overall situation from one point. Such as redressing a miscarriage of justice, who is being redressed? Hai Rui has eight cases, including disputes over property...". He wanted us to read more of the "Collection of Hai Rui's Writings" after returning to school. The two were completely in sync! Their purpose was to make us, in this class struggle, put down the weapons of class struggle, not to talk about political issues, but to talk purely about academic issues.
    Deng Tuo said, "You shouldn't have preconceptions. Whose opinion is right? Whose opinion is wrong? If you have preconceptions first, you will definitely make mistakes as you go on. Can leaning to one side discern the truth? Not necessarily. The majority opinion is not necessarily correct." He also said: "All of you here are studying history, and if you don't study and resolve the issues of national heroes and patriotism involved in the discussion of 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,' then you will not be able to talk about history, and the thousands of years of Chinese history will only become a nihilistic blank." Deng Tuo thus attempted to pull the criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" into a debate over specific historical issues, avoiding the core issue in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" - the anti-Party, anti-socialist political issue. The person in charge of *Beijing Daily* also said: "This issue involves a very wide range, including historical views, moral views, and so on, and it is not just the issue of 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'." He also added many "crimes" to this revolution, nonsensically saying that middle school teachers now "feel it is difficult to teach," that "some people dare not write historical dramas," that "some people dare not talk about inheritance," and so on. In short, all of these fully exposed their hostile sentiments towards the ongoing Great Cultural Revolution.

    假座谈之名　行反党之实
    邓拓召开了一次为吴晗开脱的反党反社会主义的座谈会。他在会上反复强调，对《海瑞罢官》不要“千篇一律”地作政治批判，企图把人们引向迷途。他还鼓动人们要“解放”资产阶级“思想”，不要有什么“顾虑”，不要怕自己和吴晗有共同之处。

    五月八日《解放军报》和《光明日报》分别发表了高炬和何明的文章以后，《北京日报》包庇邓拓反党反社会主义的内幕已经被揭穿了。我们再揭露一件邓拓和《北京日报》一起干的反党反社会主义的勾当。去年十二月十三日下午，邓拓以北京市委大学工作部之名，在市委召开了“北京市高等院校文科学生关于《海瑞罢官》讨论的座谈会”。
    在座谈会上，邓拓作了开场白和结束语，《北京日报》某负责人也参加了。这实际上是一个为吴晗开脱的反党反社会主义的会议。
    邓拓在开场白中便别有用心地要我们“不要随便听谁的话”，并且极为恶毒地说：“以前就有这种情况，一个支部书记说错了话，你反对他，他就给你扣上‘反党’的帽子，实际上是反他。”接着，他虽然不得不说真正听党的话是听党中央和毛主席的话，但是又说：“毛主席从来没有叫我们谁一定要听他的话，而是要求我们克服盲目性，……大可不必盲目地去听。”这不是仍然叫我们也不要听毛主席的话吗？难道听毛主席的话就是盲目性吗？难道听党的话只是听党中央的话而不应该听基层党组织的话吗？邓拓还说：“姚文元的文章不是结论，吴晗同志也不是一无是处。”
    邓拓还竭力为吴晗的政治错误进行了辩护。当时，中央民族学院有一位同学在发言中举例说：吴晗在《海瑞罢官》中宣扬退田，就是煽动人民搞“单干”，要挖社会主义的墙脚。邓拓听后就沉不住气了，他反问道：“是吗？一九五九年就有‘单干风’了吗？在什么地方？”那位同学回答说，一九五九年他在一个地方工作，那里就闹了“单干风”。邓拓还故意再三反问“是不是真的”。那位同学肯定说“一点不假”。这时，邓拓才装糊涂说：“啊！真有这么回事，我还不知道。”
    邓拓在会上反复强调这次大论战是“学术问题”，“必须按照‘百花齐放，百家争鸣’办事”，并且恶毒地攻击我们伟大的党，他说：“过去在这方面的方针执行得很不够，有的地方，报纸上一批评某人”，“被批评的人一下子被打到海底去了”。他还鼓动我们“思想要解放，写文章不要有顾虑，不要怕自己和吴晗有共同之处，要摆事实，讲道理，采取商榷的态度，不扣帽子，力求创造贯彻‘百花齐放，百家争鸣’方针的空气，有什么看法就写什么看法”。《北京日报》某负责人当时也跟着说：“在真理面前，人人平等。”很显然，他们是打着贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”方针的旗号，要我们去“独立思考”，企图把我们引向迷途，要我们跟他们一道去为被人民“打到海底去了”的右倾机会主义分子鸣冤叫屈，也是要我们跟他们一道去为吴晗之流作辩护。
    邓拓还“告诫”我们“要避免连篇累牍，千篇一律”，口气显然是觉得很多报纸批判吴晗的问题是“连篇累牍”了，是“千篇一律”了。《北京日报》某负责人也不厌其烦地重复，文字“不要一般化”，“要具体分析一个问题，从一点突破全局。如平冤狱，平的是谁？海瑞有八个案子，有争财产的……”。要我们回校后把《海瑞集》多看看。两人同出一辙！其目的是要我们在这场阶级斗争中，放下阶级斗争的武器，不要谈政治问题，单纯谈学术问题。
    邓拓说：“你们不要先有框框。谁的意见是对的？谁的意见是错的？如果先有框框，走下去，一定要犯错误的。一边倒是不是能分辨出真理来？不一定。多数人的意见不一定正确。”又说：“你们所有在座的人都是研究历史的，如果你们不研究和解决《海瑞罢官》讨论所涉及的民族英雄和爱国主义等问题，那末你们就无法谈历史，中华民族几千年的历史也就只能成为虚无主义的空白点了。”邓拓就是这样地企图把对《海瑞罢官》的批判拉到具体历史问题的争论上来，避开《海瑞罢官》中的核心问题——反党反社会主义的政治问题。《北京日报》某负责人也说：“这个问题涉及的面是很广的，包括历史观、道德观等问题，而不仅只是《海瑞罢官》的问题。”并且还给这场革命加了许多“罪名”，胡说什么中学教师现在“感到不好教书”啦，“有人不敢写历史剧了”啦，“有人不敢谈继承了”啦，等等。总之，所有这些充分暴露了他们对已经开展的这场文化大革命的敌对情绪。
