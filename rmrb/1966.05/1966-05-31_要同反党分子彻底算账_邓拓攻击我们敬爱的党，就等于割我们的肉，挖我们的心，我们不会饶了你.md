    Settle Accounts Thoroughly with Anti-Party Elements
    Deng Tuo's Attack on Our Beloved Party Is Like Cutting Our Flesh and Digging Out Our Hearts; We Will Not Spare You
    Teacher of the Tibetan Class of the Central School of Political Science and Law, Suolang Zhuoma
    I am a liberated serf. Recently, after listening to the radio, reading the newspapers, and studying the materials about Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, I felt extremely angry. Deng Tuo, we warn you! The Party is the great savior of our million liberated serfs, the lifeline of our lives. Your vicious attack on our beloved Party is like cutting the flesh from our bodies and digging out our hearts. We will not spare you.
    Deng Tuo, do you want us to go back to the days of the old society, living like beasts of burden? Absolutely not! In the man-eating feudal serf society, the exploitation and oppression suffered by millions of serfs were so profound. Which of us serfs does not have a history of blood and tears? Which family does not have a class grievance? Take my family as an example. Three members of my family were brutally murdered by the serf owners. I became an orphan at the age of seven, a child who still needed adult care, yet I was forced to become a slave for the serf owner. Eight years of slave life subjected me to all kinds of torment. The heartless serf owner never gave me a full meal, never gave me a pair of shoes to wear. Regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter, herding sheep and collecting firewood, rain or snow, I was barefoot all year round. The winter was so terribly cold, but the serf owner still made me sleep outside the sheepfold, not even giving me the freedom to sleep in a doghouse. I toiled like an ox and horse for them, shedding blood and sweat, receiving only beatings in return, leaving me with a body full of scars. I will never forget such a tragic life! I will always remember this blood feud!
    It was the Party and Chairman Mao who rescued our million serfs from the pit of fire, and only then did I live a happy life and become the master of the country. In the old society, no one cared whether I lived or died; I was not even worth as much as the serf owner's dog. In the new society, the Party sent me to school, provided me with food, clothing, and everything I needed, taking care of my life with meticulous attention. Now they have trained me to become a Party cadre. I have personally experienced that parents are dear, but the Communist Party is dearer; a thousand good things are not as good as socialism. Without the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, how could China have such great achievements today, and how could we liberated serfs live the happy lives we live today? The Party and Chairman Mao are our great saviors, the red sun in our hearts. We love the Party and Chairman Mao infinitely. We will always follow the Party and Chairman Mao. We cannot leave the great Communist Party and our beloved leader Chairman Mao for even a minute.
    Deng Tuo, you two-faced, scorpion-hearted bad guy, you arrogantly shouted that our Party should step down. Our million serfs understand very clearly what this means. This means realizing a counter-revolutionary restoration, attempting to drag us back to the old society, allowing the man-eating three great estate-holders to return to power and rule us again, making us slaves again, living a life worse than beasts of burden, letting the serf owners drink our blood and eat our flesh. Your opposition to the Party and socialism is opposition to the happy lives of our million serfs and the people of the whole country. It is opposition to the people being masters of their own affairs. It is wanting to exercise dictatorship over us! You will not succeed in any of these things! Whoever opposes the Party, whoever opposes Chairman Mao, whoever opposes socialism, we will fight them to the end! Deng Tuo, you bunch of bad guys, you released so much poison. We will settle accounts with you thoroughly, and uproot this big poisonous weed. Whoever dares to move a single hair of our Party and socialism, we will resolutely fight them to the end! We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, never forget class and class struggle, and we will never give up until we have overthrown you gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist monsters and demons.

    要同反党分子彻底算账
    邓拓攻击我们敬爱的党，就等于割我们的肉，挖我们的心，我们不会饶了你
    中央政法干校西藏班教员　索朗卓玛
    我是一个翻身农奴，最近，听了广播，读了报，看了邓拓反党反社会主义的材料后，感到非常气愤。邓拓，我们警告你！党是我们百万翻身农奴的大救星，是我们的命根子，你恶毒地攻击我们敬爱的党，就等于用刀子割我们身上的肉，挖我们的心，我们不会饶了你。
    邓拓，你想要我们再过旧社会牛马不如的日子吗？万万办不到！在吃人的封建农奴社会里，百万农奴受的剥削和压迫是多么深重，我们农奴，哪一个没有一部血泪史？哪一家没有一笔阶级仇？就以我家来说，我一家三口人都活活被农奴主害死了，我从七岁起就成了一个无依无靠的孤儿，还是个需要大人照顾的孩子，就被迫给农奴主当奴隶。八年的奴隶生活，使我受尽了折磨，狼心狗肺的农奴主没有给我吃过一顿饱饭，没有给我一双鞋穿，不管春夏秋冬，放羊打柴，雨里雪里，整年我都是光着脚，冬天冷的那么历害，农奴主还要我睡在羊圈外面，连睡狗窝的自由都没有。我为他们当牛当马流血流汗，得到的是毒打，留下的是一身伤疤。这样的悲惨生活，我一辈子也忘不了！我要永远牢记这笔血海深仇！
    是党和毛主席把我们百万农奴从火坑中救了出来，我才过上了幸福生活，当了国家的主人。在旧社会，我死活无人过问，不如农奴主的一条狗；在新社会，党送我上学校，供给我吃的穿的用的，对我的生活照顾得无微不至，现在又把我培养成为党的干部。我切身体会到，爹亲娘亲，没有共产党亲，千好万好，不如社会主义好。没有党和毛主席的英明领导，我国那有今天这样的伟大成就，我们翻身农奴那能过上今天的幸福生活。党和毛主席是我们的大救星，是我们心中的红太阳，我们无比热爱党和毛主席，我们永远跟着党和毛主席走，我们一分钟也不能离开伟大的共产党和敬爱的领袖毛主席。
    邓拓，你这个人面蝎子心的坏家伙，你狂妄地叫嚷要我们党下台，我们百万农奴十分清楚地懂得这是意味着什么，这就是实现反革命复辟，企图把我们拉回旧社会去，让吃人的三大领主重新上台统治我们，使我们又当奴隶，再过牛马不如的生活，让农奴主喝我们的血，吃我们的肉。你反党反社会主义，就是反对我们百万农奴和全国人民过幸福的生活，就是反对人民当家作主，就是想专我们的政！这些你们通通办不到！谁反对党，谁反对毛主席，谁反对社会主义，我们就和他拼到底！邓拓，你们这帮坏家伙，放了那么多毒，我们要彻底和你算账，把你这棵大毒草连根拔掉。谁敢动我们党和社会主义一根毫毛，我们就要坚决与他斗到底！我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远不忘阶级和阶级斗争，不把你们这伙反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神斗倒，决不罢休。
