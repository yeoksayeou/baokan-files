    Thai Authorities Brazenly Participate in US Imperialism's War of Aggression Against Vietnam
    Inevitable Linking the Vietnam Battlefield with Thailand
    Our Foreign Ministry issued a statement fully supporting the solemn position of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, strongly condemning the Thai government's announcement of sending naval and air force units to fight in South Vietnam; warning the Thai authorities that your willingness to serve US imperialism will inevitably be despised by the people of Indochina and arouse strong opposition from the Thai people, leading to your own faster downfall.
    Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on May 13 regarding the recent announcement by the Thai Thanom government to dispatch naval and air force units to fight in South Vietnam, resolutely denouncing the aggressive behavior of the Thai reactionaries as accomplices of US imperialism. The full text of the statement is as follows:
      Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
              May 13, 1966
      On May 3, the Thai Thanom government announced that it would send naval and air force units to fight in South Vietnam. This is a serious step by the Thai reactionaries to openly participate in US imperialism's war of aggression against Vietnam. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on May 6, exposing the heinous conspiracy of US imperialism to expand its war of aggression against Vietnam by driving its lackeys, and strongly condemning the provocative actions of the Thai Thanom government. The Chinese government and the Chinese people fully support the solemn position of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and resolutely denounce the aggressive behavior of the Thai reactionaries in acting as accomplices of US imperialism.
    US imperialism has always regarded the Thai reactionaries as its tools for aggression against Vietnam and the countries of Indochina. For a long time, it has directed the Thai reactionaries to carry out blatant interference in Laos and to constantly provoke and invade the Kingdom of Cambodia. Especially in US imperialism's war of aggression against Vietnam, Thailand has become an important military base for the American aggressors. The number of American military personnel stationed in Thailand has reached more than 18,000, and most of the American planes bombing Vietnam and Laos take off from Thailand; in order to expand its aggression against the countries of Indochina, the United States is also stepping up the construction of ports, airports, highways and other military facilities in Thailand. US imperialism has suffered disastrous defeats in its war of aggression against Vietnam and has fallen into unprecedented isolation. Now, it is driving the Thai reactionaries to send troops to South Vietnam to act as cannon fodder for it, which shows that US imperialism has reached the end of its rope in its war of aggression against Vietnam, and it is desperately dragging the Thai running dog into the water in order to expand the flames of aggression against Vietnam and Indochina.
    US imperialism's war of aggression against Vietnam is doomed to failure. It has sent more than 200,000 American aggressor troops, gathered tens of thousands of mercenary troops from South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, and still cannot change the passive situation of being beaten. Now, adding a few Thai warships, a few planes, and a few hundred cannon fodder will absolutely not save it from its final defeat. However, the Thai authorities should know that Thailand is right next to Indochina. Your blatant participation in US imperialism's war of aggression against Vietnam will inevitably link the Vietnam battlefield with Thailand itself, placing yourselves in a position of being enemies of the people of Indochina and Southeast Asia. We warn the Thai authorities that your willingness to betray national sovereignty and national interests, willingly serving US imperialism, will inevitably be despised by the people of Indochina and arouse strong opposition from the Thai people, thereby leading to your own faster downfall.

    我国政府和人民坚决声讨泰国反动派充当美帝帮凶
    泰国当局明目张胆地参加美帝侵越战争
    不可避免地把越南战场同泰国联系起来
    我外交部发表声明，完全支持越南民主共和国政府的严正立场，强烈谴责泰国政府宣布派海空军部队去南越作战；警告泰国当局，你们甘心为美帝效劳，必将遭到印度支那各国人民的唾弃，激起泰国人民的强烈反对，使自己更快地垮台。
    新华社十三日讯　中华人民共和国外交部十三日就泰国他侬政府最近宣布将派出海军和空军部队进入越南南方作战一事发表声明，坚决声讨泰国反动派充当美帝国主义帮凶的侵略行为。声明全文如下：
      中华人民共和国外交部声明
              一九六六年五月十三日
      五月三日，泰国他侬政府宣布，将派
  出海军和空军部队进入越南南方作战，这
  是泰国反动派公开参加美帝国主义侵略越
  南战争的一个严重步骤。越南民主共和国外交部五月六日发表声明，揭露美帝国主义驱使它的走狗扩大侵略越南战争的罪恶阴谋，强烈谴责泰国他侬政府的挑衅行动。中国政府和中国人民完全支持越南民主共和国政府的严正立场，并且坚决声讨泰国反动派充当美帝国主义帮凶的侵略行为。
    美帝国主义一直把泰国反动派作为它侵略越南和印度支那各国的工具。长期以来，它指使泰国反动派对老挝进行了露骨的干涉，对柬埔寨王国进行了不断的挑衅和侵略，特别是在美帝国主义侵略越南的战争中，泰国更成了美国侵略者的重要军事基地。美国驻扎在泰国的军事人员已经达到一万八千多人，美国轰炸越南和老挝的飞机大部分从泰国起飞；为了扩大对印度支那各国的侵略，美国还在泰国加紧修建港口、机场、公路和其他军事设施。美帝国主义在侵略越南的战争中连遭惨败，陷入空前孤立的境地。现在，它又驱使泰国反动派向南越出兵，为它充当炮灰，这就表明，美帝国主义在侵略越南的战争中已经到了山穷水尽的地步，它正在不顾一切地把泰国这条走狗拖下水，来扩大侵略越南和印度支那的战火。
    美帝国主义侵略越南的战争是注定要失败的。它派去了二十多万美国侵略军，搜罗了南朝鲜、澳大利亚和新西兰的几万仆从军，尚且不能改变被动挨打的局面，现在再增加泰国的几艘兵舰、几架飞机、几百名炮灰，也绝对不能挽救它最后失败的命运。但是，泰国当局应该知道，泰国就在印度支那的旁边，你们明目张胆地参加美帝国主义侵略越南的战争，就不可避免地把越南战场同泰国本身联系起来，把自己放在与印度支那和东南亚各国人民为敌的地位。我们警告泰国当局，你们不惜出卖国家主权和民族利益，甘心为美帝国主义效劳，必将遭到印度支那各国人民的唾弃，激起泰国人民的强烈反对，从而使你们自己更快地垮台。
