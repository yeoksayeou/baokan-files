    Two Matters of Furnace Body Maintenance

    Maintenance and Fast Steelmaking

    Furnace body maintenance and fast steelmaking are a unity of opposites. The furnace is the foundation of steelmaking, and steelmaking is the purpose of maintaining the furnace. If the head furnace operator wants to maintain the furnace body well, he must diligently repair the furnace and handle issues promptly, which takes time and conflicts with fast steelmaking; furnace foremen and team leaders often neglect furnace body maintenance in order to achieve fast steelmaking and produce more steel.

    In the past, I only saw the opposition between furnace body maintenance and fast steelmaking, and not the unity. I thought that the furnace was the foundation of steelmaking, and without a furnace, there would be no steel. The head furnace operator only focused on furnace body maintenance, only managing the furnace bottom, furnace walls, and furnace roof. He never concerned himself with fast steelmaking, thinking that was the foreman's business. Every time after tapping the steel, if the furnace bottom was slightly concave, he would quickly repair the furnace, making the repair as thick as possible, raising the molten pool very high, like a saucer. During steelmaking, when the molten steel boiled, slag and steel would spill out from the five furnace doors and two furnace heads, seriously affecting production and often causing accidents.

    Through studying Chairman Mao's philosophical works, I realized that furnace body maintenance and fast steelmaking are opposing but unified. Both furnace body maintenance and fast steelmaking are for producing more steel and making good steel to support national construction. The two cannot be separated; focusing solely on fast steelmaking or solely on furnace body maintenance is one-sided. If we only engage in fast steelmaking, although it seems like we are producing more steel in a few furnaces, it shortens the life of the furnace and ruins it, causing great losses to the country. If we only engage in furnace body maintenance and not fast steelmaking, although the furnace is well maintained and its life is extended, the effective time for steelmaking is very short, which also causes losses to the country and fails to achieve the goal of increasing production. Therefore, the two must be carried out simultaneously, both maintenance and fast steelmaking, maintenance within fast steelmaking, and fast steelmaking within maintenance, neither can be neglected. With the increased understanding, the approach also changed. We try our best to produce more steel whenever possible, reduce maintenance time, and increase steelmaking time; when maintenance is needed, we also stagger it, make preparations in advance, and strive to shorten maintenance time and extend steelmaking time. This greatly increased steelmaking time and promoted fast steelmaking.

          Early Stage and Late Stage of the Furnace

    Like people, furnaces have a youth and an old age, that is, an early stage and a late stage. In the youth, the firepower is strong, and the energy is abundant, making it easy to achieve fast steelmaking. But in old age, it is aging and frail, turning from a thoroughbred horse into an old ox furnace.

    Generally speaking, steelmaking is faster in the early stage and slower in the late stage, but the concepts of fast and slow should also be viewed dialectically. Under certain conditions, fast can become slow, and slow can become fast, it is not immutable. We have learned a lesson on this issue. A furnace that has just been repaired is smooth sailing and indeed very fast when making steel. Precisely because it is new, people develop a paralyzing thought and relax the maintenance of the furnace. As a result, not long after being fast, the front and rear walls are burned, air and gas enter the furnace through the water jacket, and the furnace heads grow taller, like a tumor on the throat. Gas and air cannot enter, resulting in premature aging of the furnace, slowing down, and becoming an old ox furnace.

    If we give full play to human's subjective initiative, engage in both fast steelmaking and maintenance in the early stage of the furnace, let people wait for the furnace, not let the furnace wait for people, and have people walk in front of the furnace, we can maintain the furnace's wonderful youth and achieve old age without decline. Last spring, our furnace entered its late stage and was a bit slow. Some people said, "Now this furnace is old, its legs and feet are not flexible, and it can't run." If it were in the past, we would no longer make efforts and just wait for the furnace to be repaired. This time, we analyzed the reasons for the furnace slowing down and adopted countermeasures to make the furnace rejuvenate and become younger, continuously achieving high-quality, good-variety, and fast steelmaking.

    炉体维护两事
    鞍钢第二炼钢厂青年团结炉总炉长　马万祥
    维护和快炼
    炉体维护和快炼是对立的统一。炉子是炼钢的基础，炼钢是维护炉子的目的。总炉长要想维护好炉体，就要勤补炉，勤处理，这样就要花费时间，和快炼有矛盾；炉长和工长为了快炼、多炼，常常忽视炉体维护。
    我过去只看到炉体维护和快炼的对立，看不到这里有统一。认为炉子是炼钢的基础，没有炉子就没有钢。总炉长只搞炉体维护，只管炉底、炉帮、炉顶。快炼从不过问，这是工长的事。每次出完钢发现炉底稍微洼一点，就赶紧炼炉，炼的越厚越好，把熔池炼的很高，象个碟子似的，炼钢时钢水一沸腾就从五个炉门、两个炉头跑渣跑钢，严重地影响生产，还常出事故。
    通过学习毛主席的哲学著作，使我认识到，炉体维护和快炼是对立的，又是统一的。炉体维护和快炼都是为了多炼钢，炼好钢，支援国家建设。这两者不能分割，单纯为了快炼和单纯为了维护炉体都是片面性。如果单搞快炼，虽然看来是多炼了几炉钢，但是缩短了炉子寿命，搞垮了炉子，为国家造成很大的损失，如果单纯搞炉体维护，不搞快炼，虽然炉子维护得很好，寿命延长了，可是，炼钢的有效时间很少，同样为国家造成损失，也达不到增产的目的。所以两者必须同时并举，既搞维护，又搞快炼，维护之中搞快炼，快炼之中搞维护，两者不能偏废。认识提高了，作法也就改变了。凡是能够多炼的，尽量做到多炼，减少维护时间，增加炼钢时间；需要维护的时候，也要交错进行，事先做好准备，竭力缩短维护时间，延长炼钢时间。这样大大增加了炼钢时间，推动了快炼。
          炉子前期和后期
    炉子和人一样，有青年时期，老年时期，也就是前期和后期。在青年时期火力方刚，精力充沛，很容易做到快炼。而在老年时期，年迈体衰，腿脚不灵，由千里马变成老牛炉。
    一般说来，前期炼钢快些，后期慢些，但对快和慢也要用辩证观点来看。在一定条件下，快可变慢，慢也可以变快，不是一成不变的。在这个问题上我们是有教训的。刚修完的炉子，炼起钢来一顺百顺，的确很快。正因为是新的，人们就产生麻痹思想，对炉子维护就放松了。结果快了不久，前后墙烧坏，往炉内进空气和煤气的水套、炉头长高，象人在咽喉上长了瘤，煤气空气进不去，结果炉子未老先衰，就慢起来，变成了老牛炉。
    如果充分发挥人的主观能动性，在炉子前期既搞快炼，又搞维护，让人等炉子，不让炉子等人，人走在炉子前面，就可以使炉子葆其美妙的青春，做到老而不衰。去年春天，我们炉子进入了后期，有点慢了，有人说：“现在这炉子老了，腿脚不灵巧了，跑不动了。”要是过去也就不再努力了，只等修炉。这次，我们分析了炉子变慢的原因，采取了对策，使炉子又返老还童了，变得年轻起来，连连出现质量高、品种好的快速炼钢。
