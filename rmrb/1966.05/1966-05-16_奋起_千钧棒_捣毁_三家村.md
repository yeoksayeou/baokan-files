    Rise Up with the "Magic Cudgel" to Smash the "Three-Family Village"
    Zhou Mingshan, Representative of the National People's Congress, Secretary of the Jiangxian County Party Committee, Shanxi Province
    Deng Tuo, this small handful of despicable traitors of the proletariat, filial sons and virtuous grandsons of the bourgeoisie, in order to clear the way for capitalist restoration, have launched the most frenzied and vicious attacks against our great Party and our great leader Chairman Mao. If Deng Tuo and his ilk's conspiracy were to succeed, we would lose our Party and our country, and millions of people would lose their heads. We must thoroughly overthrow this gang of villains from the "Three-Family Village," and we will never stop until we achieve complete victory!
    Deng Tuo, you anti-Party, anti-people bourgeois careerist, are you blind? No, you are blinder than the blind. Are you deaf? No, you are deafer than the deaf. Are you mad? No, you are madder than the mad. You slander our Party leader as "self-righteous," "Zhuge Liang with juice," suffering from some "amnesia," "madness," you want our great leader to step down to "rest." This is absolutely impossible! Our leader Chairman Mao is the lighthouse, the helmsman, the savior, the sun. From the bottom of our hearts, we hope our greatest leader Chairman Mao lives ten thousand years!
    In our Nanliu Brigade, and in our Jiangxian County, we love to listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, and we love to read Chairman Mao's books the most. Now the people of the entire county are studying Chairman Mao's works with the greatest enthusiasm, men learn, women also learn, adults learn, children also learn, young people learn, old people also learn, literate people learn, and illiterate people also learn. Here, Chairman Mao's works are the most precious gifts, the most valuable wealth, and people feel extremely honored and happy to receive a copy of Chairman Mao's book. On May 7th, we held a conference to distribute copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," attended by more than a thousand people. When the young girl Li Lanhua went to attend the meeting, her mother told her to dress neatly, saying, "Child, today is everyone's joyous day. When you bring back Chairman Mao's book, it's like Chairman Mao has come to our house. If it weren't for Chairman Mao, our family would have been wiped out long ago!" I gave a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" to Dong Yuhe, the Party branch secretary of the Dongheshui Brigade in the Dajiao Commune. Dong Yuhe was so happy that he couldn't sleep well for three nights. Holding Chairman Mao's book, he read and laughed with joy. He thought of the suffering of the old society and the happiness of the new society, and he thought of the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek's cruelty and viciousness, and the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's brilliance and greatness. Mao Zedong Thought is playing a great role in transforming society, transforming nature, and transforming thought in our Jiangxian County. Two sayings are circulating among the masses of Jiangxian County: No matter what book you don't read, you can't not read Chairman Mao's book; no matter what words you don't listen to, you can't not listen to Chairman Mao's words. Mao Zedong Thought is the driving force for progress, the source of wisdom, and the infinitely powerful spiritual atomic bomb. Deng Tuo, Liao Mosha, and Wu Han, you slander our Party as "untrustworthy," and "unworthy of trust," this is completely nonsense. The revolutionary people of our country and the revolutionary people of the world trust Chairman Mao the most and love Chairman Mao the most. Only you a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements are filled with deep hatred for the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.
    Deng Tuo! You viciously slander our Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, nonsensically saying that the Great Leap Forward was "bragging" and "banged its head and bled" in the face of facts. Who exactly banged their heads and bled in the face of facts? It is definitely not our revolutionary people, it is precisely yourself and your "Three-Family Village" gang of counter-revolutionary elements. Just take our Nanliu as an example. In 1958, it was exactly my second year as the branch secretary. In that year, Nanliu, like the Great Leap Forward across the country, also underwent tremendous changes. That year, we launched a heroic struggle against the poor mountains and bad waters, turning Nanliu's rotten slopes into terraced fields, and grain production increased significantly. It was also in this year that the masses of our entire village, through this great revolutionary practice, received an extremely profound education in Mao Zedong Thought, further establishing the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, daring to act, daring to break through, and daring to create. In the following three consecutive years of natural disasters, we continued to achieve sustained and great improvements and developments in grain and cotton production, as well as in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. In 1965, we encountered a severe drought of 150 consecutive days without rain, but the agricultural production of our Nanliu Brigade achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Wheat yield reached 425 jin per mu, more than four times that before liberation, and more than 30 percent higher than in 1964.
    Our Jiangxian County is also the same. Because we held high the red flag of the General Line and relied on the superiority of the collective economy of the People's Commune, we achieved a Great Leap Forward. In 1958, we achieved a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, cultural education, and other aspects. Grain and cotton production increased by 21 percent and 71 percent respectively compared with the highest historical year of 1956. And the grain production in 1965 increased by 17 percent compared with 1958. Deng Tuo, you say our Great Leap Forward is "bragging," "talking big," isn't this the most vicious and shameless attack and slander! In the face of these ironclad facts, it is your "Three-Family Village" gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements who banged their heads and bled, and were smashed to pieces!
    Deng Tuo, you also attack our proletarian dictatorship, saying that our proletarian dictatorship is "disregarding everything, relying on power and influence, acting recklessly, and seizing by trickery and force," what kind of talk is this! You attack the proletarian dictatorship because you want to abolish the proletarian dictatorship, restore the bourgeois dictatorship, let the Kuomintang, reactionaries, landlords, and rich peasants regain power, and let your "Three-Family Village" gang of conspirators, careerists, and bourgeois lackeys and descendants regain power, while knocking down the working-class and peasant masses who have already become masters of their own affairs, and subject them to your oppression and exploitation again. You are wrong, your sinister conspiracy can never succeed, because the working-class and peasant masses will never forget the suffering they experienced in the old society. We clearly know that if demons and monsters come to power, the broad masses of the people will suffer.
    Chairman Mao said: "All erroneous ideas, all poisonous weeds, all demons and monsters should be criticized, and they must never be allowed to run rampant freely." Now that the demons and monsters of the "Three-Family Village" have emerged, don't even think about sneaking away. We, the millions of "Golden Monkeys" armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will rise up with the "Magic Cudgel" to destroy your "Three-Family Village," so that "the universe will be clear of dust for ten thousand miles."

    奋起“千钧棒”捣毁“三家村”
    全国人民代表大会代表山西绛县县委书记  周明山
    邓拓这一小撮无产阶级的可耻叛徒，资产阶级的孝子贤孙，为了给资本主义复辟鸣锣开道，向我们伟大的党、伟大的领袖毛主席，发出了最猖狂、最恶毒的攻击。要是让邓拓这伙人的阴谋得逞，我们就要亡党亡国，就要千百万人头落地。我们一定要彻底打倒“三家村”这一伙坏蛋，不获全胜，决不收兵！
    邓拓，你这个反党反人民的资产阶级野心家，你是个瞎子吗？不，你比瞎子还瞎。你是个聋子吗？不，你比聋子还聋。你是个疯子吗？不，你比疯子还疯。你污蔑我们党的领袖是“自作聪明”、“带汁的诸葛亮”、得了什么“健忘症”、“疯狂”病，你想让我们伟大的领袖下台“休息”。这是绝对办不到的！我们的领袖毛主席是灯塔，是舵手，是救星，是太阳。我们从心眼里希望我们最伟大的领袖毛主席万岁万万岁！
    在我们南柳大队也好，在我们绛县也好，毛主席的话我们最爱听，毛主席的书我们最爱读。现在全县人民以最大的热情学习毛主席著作，男人学，女人也学，大人学，小孩也学，青年人学，老年人也学，识字的学，不识字的也学。我们这里，毛主席著作是最珍贵的礼品，最宝贵的财富，人们得到一本毛主席的书就会感到万分的光荣和高兴。五月七日，我们召开了一个发《毛主席语录》本的大会，参加大会的有一千多人，青年姑娘李兰花去参加会的时候，妈妈让她穿得整整齐齐，告她说：“孩子，今天是大家的喜日子，你领来毛主席的书，就等于毛主席到咱家了。咱家要不是毛主席，可早就灭门绝户了啊！”我送给大交公社东贺水大队支部书记董玉合一本毛主席语录，董玉合高兴得三个晚上没有睡好觉。他捧着毛主席的书，高兴得念一阵笑一阵。他从旧社会的痛苦想到新社会的幸福，他从国民党、蒋介石的残忍毒辣，想到共产党、毛主席的英明伟大。毛泽东思想正在我们绛县发挥着改造社会、改造自然、改造思想的伟大作用。我们绛县群众中流传着这样两句话：什么书不读也不能不读毛主席的书；什么话不听也不能不听毛主席的话。毛泽东思想是前进的动力，是智慧的源泉，是威力无穷的精神原子弹。邓拓、廖沫沙、吴晗，你们污蔑我们党“言而无信”，“不堪信任”，这完全是胡说八道。我们全国革命的人民，全世界革命的人民，最信任毛主席，最热爱毛主席，只有你们一小撮反党反社会主义分子，才对党中央和毛主席充满了刻骨的仇恨。
    邓拓！你恶毒地污蔑我们党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社，胡说什么大跃进是“吹牛皮”，在事实面前“碰得头破血流”。到底谁在事实面前碰得头破血流呢？决不是我们革命的人民，正是你自己和你的“三家村”那一伙反革命分子。就说我们南柳吧，一九五八年正好是我当了支部书记的第二年，这一年，我们南柳跟全国的大跃进一样，也发生了巨大的变化。那一年，我们和穷山恶水展开了英勇搏斗，把南柳的烂坡地，搞成水平梯田，粮食产量大幅度增产。就是这一年，我们全村群众通过这一伟大的革命实践，受到了一次极其深刻的毛泽东思想的教育，进一步树立了敢想、敢干、敢闯、敢创的革命精神，在以后连续三年的自然灾害中，继续使粮食、棉花产量以及农林牧副各业，都取得了持续大提高大发展。一九六五年，我们遇到了一连一百五十天没下透雨的大旱灾，我们南柳大队的农业生产却取得了史无前例的大丰收，小麦亩产四百二十五斤，超过解放前的四倍，超过一九六四年的百分之三十。
    我们绛县也是这样。由于我们高举总路线的红旗，依靠人民公社集体经济的优越性，实现了大跃进，一九五八年取得了农业生产、文化教育等各方面的全面大跃进，粮棉产量分别比历史上最高的一九五六年增长百分之二十一和百分之七十一。而一九六五年的粮食产量又比一九五八年增长百分之十七。邓拓你们说我们的大跃进是“吹牛皮”，“说大话”，这不是最恶毒最无耻的攻击和污蔑吗！在这铁的事实面前，是你们“三家村”这一伙反党反社会主义分子碰得头破血流，粉身碎骨！
    邓拓，你还攻击我们的无产阶级专政，说我们的无产阶级专政是“不顾一切，依靠权势，蛮横逞强，巧取豪夺”，这是什么话！你们攻击无产阶级专政，是想取消无产阶级专政，恢复资产阶级专政，让国民党、反动派、地主富农重新上台，让你们“三家村”这一伙阴谋家、野心家，资产阶级的徒子徒孙重新上台，而把已经当家作主的工农群众，重新打倒在地，再受你们的压榨剥削。你们想错了，你们这种罪恶阴谋是绝对不能得逞的，因为工农群众永远不会忘记在旧社会的那种苦难遭遇，我们清楚地知道，牛鬼蛇神上台，广大人民就会遭殃。
    毛主席说：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”现在，“三家村”的牛鬼蛇神既然出笼了，你们就别想溜走。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的千百万“金猴”，就要奋起“千钧棒”，摧毁你们的“三家村”，使得“玉宇澄清万里埃”。
