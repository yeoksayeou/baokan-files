    Every Word and Sentence Has a Thousand Catties of Force
    Anhui Zongyang Commune Member Hai Feng
《Quotations from Chairman Mao》 in my pocket, a red sun rises in my heart, treading on icy mountains, the snow melts away, I don't feel the cold in the severe winter.
《Quotations from Chairman Mao》 with me, my heart is red, my eyes are bright, and the direction is clear; a level ten typhoon cannot blow me down, and I can recognize the course through the foggy sea.
《Quotations from Chairman Mao》贴 on my chest, my heart is full of strength, and my ambition soars to the clouds. When I swing the hammer, it weighs only four taels, and when I work, it is like a whirlwind.
《Quotations from Chairman Mao》 Open it up, and ten thousand strands of spring light rush towards me; every word and sentence has a thousand catties of force, every sentence and word shines brilliantly.
