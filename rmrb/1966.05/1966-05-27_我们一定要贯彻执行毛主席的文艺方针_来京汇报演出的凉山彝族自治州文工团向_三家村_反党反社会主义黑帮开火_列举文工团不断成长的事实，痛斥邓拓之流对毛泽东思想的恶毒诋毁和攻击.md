    Xinhua News Agency, 26th - The literary and art workers of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture Cultural Troupe of Sichuan Province, who are currently reporting their performances in the capital, have been writing big-character posters, publishing wall newspapers, and holding forums in recent days to open fire on the "Three-Family Village" black gang headed by Deng Tuo. They particularly linked this with the facts of the cultural troupe's continuous growth and development under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and denounced the anti-Party and anti-socialist elements such as Deng Tuo for their slander and attacks on Mao Zedong Thought.
    They said that they had come to Beijing from the distant southwest border, carrying the wishes of the people of Liangshan to report to the Party and Chairman Mao. What they are reporting is the earth-shaking changes in Liangshan under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, leaping from a slave society across several centuries to a socialist society. The reporting performance itself is a powerful rebuff to the Deng Tuo black gang.
    The actors of the cultural troupe said that Deng Tuo and other anti-Party and anti-socialist elements fiercely opposed the policy of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving socialism, and opposed revolutionary modern dramas with workers, peasants, and soldiers as the masters of the stage, stubbornly protecting emperors, kings, generals, and ministers from occupying the stage. In "Three-Family Village Notes," they viciously attacked modern dramas, saying, "Whether modern dramas can be preserved in the end still depends on the plays themselves, not on subjective praise and protection." They also clamored that modern and traditional plays "should be treated equally." The actors refuted the slander of revolutionary modern dramas by anti-Party and anti-socialist elements such as Deng Tuo with the fact that they performed many revolutionary modern dramas, especially the main play "Song of the Slaves" performed in Beijing this time. They said that the first large-scale drama "Song of the Slaves," reflecting the heroic struggle of the Yi people under the leadership of the Party, has been warmly welcomed by the Yi people and also by the vast audience in the Han areas for seven years since it was performed. Every time this drama, which writes about slaves, performs as slaves, and reflects the revolutionary struggle storm of slaves, the emotions on and off the stage are always intertwined. Many people watch it again and again, even after watching it five or six times. This play has been performed for seven years, from Liangshan to Beijing. Is this something that a few people "praise" up? If it is "praise," it is the praise of the vast emancipated slaves and the vast masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. If it is "protection," it is the approval of the vast emancipated slaves and the vast masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The workers, peasants, and soldiers want to "protect" the "carriage" of revolutionary modern dramas, and never "protect" the "carriage" of emperors, kings, generals, and ministers, and never "protect" the "carriage" of poisonous weeds like "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"!
    Actors Yuan Shijin, Xu Dazhong, and others said that the "Three-Family Village" black gang advocated art first, and absurdly said that people paid more attention to modern dramas, "especially how the artistry is," turning literature and art, this weapon of class struggle, into an object for everyone to "appreciate," the purpose of which is to make literature and art depart from the leadership of the Party, depart from the actual struggle, and become their tool for carrying out "peaceful evolution" and restoring capitalism. They said that literature and art are by no means something for "appreciation," but "a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and eliminating the enemy." They cited the fact that once, the cultural troupe went to Moni Township, which was hit by a severe hailstorm, to offer condolences. The local emancipated slaves studied Chairman Mao's works and gained infinite strength. They said, "Hail can knock down crops, but it cannot knock down our advanced ideas!" They completed the task of replanting with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man who removed the mountains, and won a bumper harvest. The performance team compiled a play called "Advanced Ideas Cannot Be Knocked Down" based on the situation of this disaster relief struggle. Although this play was created in a relatively short time and the performance was relatively hasty, the masses liked it very much. This fact fully proves that the principle of political criteria first, artistic criteria second, instructed by Chairman Mao, is completely correct. Yuan Shijin, and others said that high mountains cannot block the sun, and strong winds cannot knock down old forests. The more the "Three-Family Village" black gang opposes Mao Zedong Thought, the more we must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the class nature and combat effectiveness of literature and art, thoroughly revolutionize, and never change our color.
    Some actors of the cultural troupe were very angry at Deng Tuo's attack on the policy of intellectuals integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. The actors resolutely counterattacked Deng Tuo's attack with their own experiences and feelings. They said that Chairman Mao called on literary and art workers to go deep into the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and shift their foothold to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, which is the bright road that all revolutionary literary and art workers must take. Since the establishment of the troupe, they have been adhering to this direction instructed by Chairman Mao, insisting on participating in actual struggles, integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and transforming their thinking, and thus have achieved great gains. In many of the songs, dances, and drama programs they created, those worker-peasant-soldier heroes are all comrades-in-arms they met in the struggle. In the nine years since the establishment of the troupe, the road they have traveled in the process of integrating with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers has become wider and wider.
    Yi actors Gu Rigubo and Li Yuebo severely denounced Deng Tuo's fallacy of fiercely opposing workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering cultural and theoretical knowledge. They said that the workers, peasants, and soldiers and emancipated slaves of the Mao Zedong era must be able to master cultural and theoretical knowledge and must be able to occupy the socialist cultural front. Gu Rigubo vividly confirmed this truth with his own experience. He said that he was pulled by the slave owner to be a guozhuang wazi (the lowest level of slave) at the age of seven, and spent all day going up the mountain to graze sheep and pigs, living a life worse than cattle and horses. One winter, a sheep was taken away by a tiger, and the slave owner put him in snow water for a whole day and night. After liberation, it was Chairman Mao who rescued this suffering child from the fire pit and sent him to school. He mastered cultural and theoretical knowledge, could write lyrics and poetry, became a people's singer, and became a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought. Gu Rigubo's growth is a microcosm of the growth of thousands upon thousands of slaves in Liangshan. Where did their knowledge come from? The Communist Party and Chairman Mao opened up the road for hundreds of thousands of slaves in Liangshan to master cultural and theoretical knowledge!
    The members of the cultural troupe said that the emancipated slaves of Liangshan regard the Party and Chairman Mao as their dearest "A'da" and "A'ma" (father and mother). In the dozen or so years since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the size of Liangshan has fundamentally changed its former poor and backward face, showing a scene of prosperity. Deng Tuo and other anti-Party and anti-socialist elements vainly attempt to overthrow the socialist system and let the slave owners' whips beat the people of Liangshan again. We will never spare him! Longtou Mountain is high, formed by the bones of our slaves in the past; the Jinsha River is long, formed by the blood and tears of our slaves in the past. Which of the hundreds of thousands of slaves in our Liangshan has no hatred? Who has no hatred? Who does not have scars on their body? Whoever dares to shoot poisonous arrows at the Party and our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, we will fight him to the end!

    我们一定要贯彻执行毛主席的文艺方针
    来京汇报演出的凉山彝族自治州文工团向“三家村”反党反社会主义黑帮开火  列举文工团不断成长的事实，痛斥邓拓之流对毛泽东思想的恶毒诋毁和攻击
    新华社二十六日讯　正在首都汇报演出的四川省凉山彝族自治州文工团的文艺工作者们，连日来纷纷写大字报，出墙报，举行座谈，向以邓拓为首的“三家村”黑帮开火。他们特别联系这个文工团在毛泽东思想指引下不断成长发展的事实，痛斥邓拓等反党反社会主义分子对毛泽东思想的诋毁和攻击。
    他们说，他们这次从遥远的西南边疆千里迢迢地来到北京，是带着凉山人民的心愿来向党向毛主席汇报的。他们汇报的是凉山人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，从奴隶社会跨越几个世纪飞跃到社会主义社会的翻天覆地的变化，汇报演出的本身就是对邓拓黑帮的一个有力的回击。
    文工团的演员们说，邓拓等反党反社会主义分子激烈反对文艺为工农兵服务，为社会主义服务的方针，反对以工农兵作为舞台主人的革命现代剧，顽固地保护帝王将相霸占舞台。他们在《三家村札记》中恶毒攻击说，现代剧“是否能保留下来，最终到底还得靠剧目本身，不能依靠主观的捧场和保驾”。还叫嚣对现代剧目和传统剧目“应该一视同仁”。演员们以他们演出的许多革命现代剧，特别是这次来京演出的主要剧目《奴隶之歌》的事实，驳斥邓拓等反党反社会主义分子对革命现代剧的诬蔑。他们说，第一部反映彝族人民在党的领导下英勇斗争的大型话剧《奴隶之歌》演出七年来，不但受到彝族人民的热烈欢迎，也受到汉族地区广大观众的欢迎。这部写奴隶、演奴隶、反映奴隶革命斗争风暴的话剧每次演出的时候，台上台下的感情始终交融在一起。不少人一看再看，看了五六遍还要看。这个剧演了七年，从凉山演到北京，这难道是少数人“吹捧”起来的吗？要说是“吹捧”，那就是广大翻身奴隶、广大工农兵群众的赞扬，要说是“保驾”，那就是广大翻身奴隶、广大工农兵群众的批准。工农兵就是要“保”革命现代剧的“驾”，而绝不“保”帝王将相的“驾”，绝不“保”《海瑞罢官》之类的毒草的“驾”！
    演员袁世金、徐大中等说，“三家村”黑帮鼓吹艺术性第一，胡说人们对现代剧更为注意的“特别是艺术性怎么样”，把文艺这个阶级斗争的武器说成是供大家“欣赏”的对象，其目的是要使文艺脱离党的领导，脱离现实斗争，成为他们搞“和平演变”，复辟资本主义的工具。他们说，文艺绝不是什么供“欣赏”的东西，而是“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”。他们列举了这样一个事实：有一次，文工团演出队到遭受特大冰雹袭击的莫尼乡慰问。当地翻身奴隶学习了毛主席著作，增强了无穷的力量。他们说，“冰雹能打掉庄稼，但是打不掉我们先进的思想！”他们以愚公移山的精神完成了抢种补种任务，夺得了丰收。演出队把这次抗灾斗争的情况编写了一个叫《先进思想打不掉》的剧本。尽管这个剧本创作时间比较短，演出比较仓促，但是群众却非常喜爱这个戏。这个事实完全证明了毛主席指示的政治标准第一、艺术标准第二的原则是完全正确的。袁世金等说，高山挡不住太阳，狂风刮不倒老林，“三家村”黑帮越反对毛泽东思想，我们就越要高举毛泽东思想的红旗，坚持文艺的阶级性、战斗性，彻底革命，永不变色。
    文工团的一些演员对邓拓攻击知识分子和工农兵相结合的方针非常气愤。演员们以自己亲身的经历和体会坚决反击邓拓的进攻。他们说，毛主席号召文艺工作者深入工农兵群众，把立足点移到工农兵方面来，这是一切革命的文艺工作者所必须走的光明大道。他们建团以来，正是按照毛主席指示的这个方向，坚持参加实际斗争，同工农兵结合，改造思想，因此取得了很大的收获。在他们创作的许多歌舞、戏剧节目中，那些工农兵英雄人物都是他们在斗争中结识的战友。建团九年来，他们在同工农兵群众结合的过程中，走的路越来越宽广了。
    彝族演员古日古波和李约波严厉痛斥了邓拓激烈反对工农兵掌握文化理论知识的谬论。他们说，毛泽东时代的工农兵和翻身奴隶一定能够掌握文化理论知识，一定能够占领社会主义的文化阵地。古日古波以他亲身的经历生动地证实了这个真理。他说，他七岁就被奴隶主拉去做锅庄娃子（最底层的奴隶），整天上山放羊放猪，过着牛马不如的生活。有一年冬天，一只羊被老虎叼走了，奴隶主把他放在雪水里泡了整整一天一夜。解放了，是毛主席把这个苦娃子从火坑里救了出来，送他进了学校。他掌握了文化理论知识，能写歌词会写诗，成了人民的歌手，成了毛泽东思想的宣传员。古日古波的成长是凉山千千万万个奴隶成长的一个缩影。他们的知识都是从哪里来的？是共产党、毛主席为凉山成千上万奴隶群众打开了掌握文化理论知识的道路！
    文工团的团员们说，凉山的翻身奴隶把党和毛主席看成是他们最亲最亲的“阿大”“阿妈”（爹妈）。解放后十几年来，特别是一九五八年大跃进以来，大小凉山根本改变了昔日贫困落后的面貌，展现出一片繁荣兴旺的景象。邓拓等反党反社会主义分子妄想推翻社会主义制度，让奴隶主的鞭子再抽打在凉山人民的身上，我们绝对饶不了他！龙头山高，是我们奴隶昔日的尸骨堆成的；金沙江长，是我们奴隶昔日的血泪流成的。我们凉山几十万奴隶哪个没有仇？哪个没有恨？哪个身上没有伤疤？谁胆敢向党、向我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席放射毒箭，我们就要同他斗争到底！
