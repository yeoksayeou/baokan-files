    We must seize the seals of authority in the literary and art front
    -- Soldiers of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region talk about the Socialist Cultural Revolution

    Yao Yuliang (Five-Good Soldier):
    *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office*, *The Lin Family Shop*, *The Battle of Jinan*, *Pressganging*, these filthy things, disguised in various forms, are actually disguised reactionary slogans, bourgeois sugar-coated bullets!
    They painstakingly beautify landlord bosses, landlord wives, bourgeois elements, and Kuomintang reactionary officers, and even want us to learn from Hai Rui, to learn from Shou Sheng to coexist peacefully with boss Lin… we will never fall for that!
    Chairman Mao said: "After the enemies with guns have been wiped out, there will still be enemies without guns; they will inevitably wage a life-and-death struggle against us, and we must never underestimate these enemies."
    This is a battle without gunfire. We must stand up, follow Chairman Mao's supreme instructions, wage a resolute struggle against this group of enemies rushing towards us, and defend Mao Zedong Thought, defend socialist literature and art.

    He Guangming (Five-Good Soldier, Squad Leader):
    Chairman Mao taught us to "regard all emperors, kings, generals and ministers as mere dirt," but those bourgeois men of letters and scholars are desperately applying rouge and powder to the reactionary rulers and exploiting classes who rode on the backs of the people, saying that they "did many beneficial things for the people," saying that they were "great politicians," "remarkable figures," and calling on us to learn from them.
    Could it be said that Hai Rui's appeasement of miners and Wu Zetian's suppression of the Dongting Lake peasant uprising were in line with the interests of the people? Are they worth learning from?
    Chairman Mao taught us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history."
    But Wu Han and others tampered with history, insisting that emperors, kings, generals and ministers are the masters of history.
    They are rich men, slave owners. They are not the masters of history! It is the broad masses of the working people who play a decisive role in history, and only the working people are the masters of history.

    Deng Liansheng:
    Chairman Mao said: "In the world today all culture, all literature and art belong to definite classes and are geared to definite political lines. There is in fact no such thing as art for art's sake, art that stands above classes or art that is detached from or independent of politics."
    Wu Han, Xia Yan, Tian Han and others are desperately spreading "supra-class" viewpoints, spreading bourgeois toxins, wanting us to be peaceful and intimate with the enemy, which runs counter to Mao Zedong Thought.
    Our company's performance group can only promote Mao Zedong Thought. We must write, describe and perform vividly the good deeds and heroic models in our company, and adhere to Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thinking.

    Lu Zhongming (Five-Good Soldier, Squad Leader):
    Wu Han said: "These old historical dramas have been performed for decades or hundreds of years, and have been well received by the masses, so there is no need to oppose them, and they should not be changed."
    Who exactly likes to see them?
    Can we revolutionary soldiers like the feudal rulers' lackeys Hai Rui and Xie Yaohuan? We don't like them at all! This is what Wu Han imposed on us. In the final analysis, he himself likes to see them.
    What we like are Dong Cunrui, Wang Cheng, Li Yuhe, Li Tiemei, Grandma Li. Only their heroic qualities can encourage us to carry the revolution through to the end.

    Lao Ronghua (Five-Good Soldier):
    Bourgeois literary and art masters, don't make literature and art so mysterious, don't put on such an arrogant face. The era of your monopoly on literature and art is over. We must seize the seal of authority in literature and art.
    In our army, there are many heroic figures, good people and good deeds. They are the masters of history, the protagonists of the stage. We must write about them and perform them vividly. This is the real historical drama, and this is what we like to see!

    He Guangming:
    Bourgeois spokesmen use the stage to oppose the Party and oppose socialism, scolding our beloved Party Central Committee through Hai Rui's mouth, portraying the bourgeoisie as "kind" people, attempting to blur our class concepts, and paving the way for capitalist restoration. We workers, peasants and soldiers will never allow it. All bourgeois literary and art masters: get off the stage of history! We workers, peasants and soldiers will not only hold our guns tightly to defend every inch of our motherland, but also pick up our pens to occupy every inch of the proletarian literary and artistic position, and fight the bourgeois literary and art masters to the end!

    我们要把文艺战线的印把子夺过来
    ——广州部队某部连队战士谈社会主义文化大革命姚玉良（五好战士）：
    《海瑞罢官》、《林家铺子》、《兵临城下》、《抓壮丁》这些乌七八糟的东西，披着形形色色的外衣，其实是变相的反动标语，资产阶级的糖衣炮弹！
    他们费尽心机，极力美化地主头子，地主婆头子，资产阶级分子，国民党反动军官，还妄想要我们去学习海瑞，学习寿生跟林老板和平共处……，我们绝不上这个当！
    毛主席说：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拼死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”
    这是一场听不见枪炮声的战斗，我们要站出来，按照毛主席的最高指示，对这一伙迎面扑来的敌人作坚决的斗争，捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫社会主义的文艺。何光明（五好战士、班长）：
    毛主席教导我们，要“粪土当年万户侯”，那些资产阶级的文人学士却拼命给骑在人民头上的反动统治者、剥削阶级涂脂抹粉，说什么他们给“人民作了许多有益的事情”，说什么他们是“伟大的政治家”，“了不起的人物”，号召我们学习他们。
    难道说：海瑞镇抚矿工，武则天剿抚洞庭湖的农民起义，是符合人民利益的？是值得学习的？
    毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”
    吴晗等人却篡改历史，硬说帝王将相是历史的主人。
    他们是财主，奴隶主。他们不是历史的主人！在历史上起决定作用的是广大劳动人民，只有劳动人民才是历史的主人。邓连生：
    毛主席说：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。为艺术的艺术，超阶级的艺术，和政治并行或互相独立的艺术，实际上是不存在的。”
    吴晗、夏衍、田汉等人却在拼命散布“超阶级”的观点，散布资产阶级毒素，要我们跟敌人和平亲热，这是和毛泽东思想背道而驰的。
    我们连的演唱组，只能宣传毛泽东思想，我们要把连队的好人好事，英雄模范大写特写大演特演，坚持毛主席的文艺思想。卢中明（五好战士、班长）：
    吴晗说：“这些旧历史剧，已经上演几十年，几百年了，已经为人民群众喜闻乐见，所以也不必去反对它，不应该改动它。”
    到底是谁喜闻乐见？
    我们革命战士，能喜欢封建统治者的奴才海瑞和谢瑶环吗？我们根本不喜欢！这是吴晗强加给我们的。归根结蒂是他自己喜闻乐见。
    我们喜欢的是董存瑞，王成，李玉和，李铁梅，李奶奶，只有他们的英雄品质，才能鼓励我们把革命进行到底。劳荣华（五好战士）：
    资产阶级的文艺老爷们，你们不要把文艺说得那么神秘，不要把面孔装得那么高傲，你们垄断文艺的时代已经过去了，我们要把文艺的印把子夺过来。
    在我们部队里，有许多英雄人物，好人好事，他们才是历史的主人，舞台的主角，我们要大写他们，大演他们，这才是真正的历史剧，这才是我们喜闻乐见的东西！何光明：
    资产阶级的代言人利用舞台来反党反社会主义，借海瑞的嘴骂我们敬爱的党中央，把资产阶级说成是“善良的”人，企图模糊我们的阶级观念，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。我们工农兵是坚决不容许的。一切资产阶级的文艺老爷们：滚下历史舞台去！我们工农兵不但要紧握枪杆，捍卫祖国每一寸土地，也要拿起笔来，占领无产阶级文艺的每一寸阵地，和资产阶级的文艺老爷们斗争到底！
