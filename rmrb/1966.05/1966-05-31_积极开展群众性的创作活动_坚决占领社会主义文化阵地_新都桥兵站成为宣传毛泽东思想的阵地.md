    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 30th dispatch: The Xinduqiao Barracks on the Sichuan-Tibet Highway has created a large number of revolutionary literary and artistic programs to perform for passing troops, making the barracks a position for propagating Mao Zedong Thought.
    As early as 1963, the higher-level Party committee required that the barracks be run as "both a food and lodging reception station and a propaganda and mobilization station." Over the past few years, the Xinduqiao Barracks has relied on "external assistance" to realize this requirement. Whenever there was an important reception task, it would borrow singing groups from nearby fraternal units. When the reception work ended, the singing groups left, and the propaganda and mobilization work in the station also ended. In February of last year, the higher-level Party committee requested that "both a food and lodging reception station and a propaganda and mobilization station" be implemented and regarded as a concrete action to highlight politics. Some people said: "Barracks are for providing lodging and cooking. As long as the passing personnel eat well and sleep well, the task is completed." In response to these active thoughts, the Party branch organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," so that they realized that the barracks must have both a material menu and a "spiritual menu." Propagating Mao Zedong Thought through singing short and pithy literary and artistic programs is an indispensable task for the barracks. At the same time, the Party branch organized the barracks staff to study Chairman Mao's works such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and "On the Chongqing Negotiations," drawing strength from them to overcome various difficulties. Soon, the Xinduqiao Barracks established its own singing group.
    The Party branch of the barracks also called on everyone to actively carry out amateur creative activities, and emphasized that the barracks is a position for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and a battleground for promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology. They must not abandon this position just because their cultural level is relatively low. As a result, a wave of amateur creative activity was set off in the barracks. Deng Weiqing, a soldier who had never been engaged in creative work, also picked up a pen. He wrote eight literary and artistic performance materials in three months. Han Desi, a military doctor, had not been interested in literature and art in the past, and his cultural level was not high. After studying Chairman Mao's expositions on literary and artistic work and Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions on the cultural work of the troops, he went deep into the passing convoys to understand the situation and compiled "Driving Safety Song," which was welcomed by the motor vehicle soldiers. Chen Defa, a young worker in the barracks, was influenced by bourgeois fame and gain views in school and wanted to become a "writer." He looked down on the singing group. After studying "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," he realized that revolutionary literature and art are "created for the workers, peasants and soldiers and used by the workers, peasants and soldiers." He enthusiastically wrote performance materials for the singing group and actively participated in singing activities. In less than four months, he wrote sixteen programs such as "Four Firsts Must Be Implemented" and "Praise Heroic Motor Vehicle Soldiers," which had very good performance results.
    Last year, the Xinduqiao Barracks performed more than 240 performances for passing troops, mainly with its own creations. The commanders and fighters who watched their performances said, "Watching the performance is like attending a vivid political lesson."
  “Eating well and sleeping well warms the body, watching well and listening well warms the heart, the Xinduqiao Barracks is really as warm as home.”

    积极开展群众性的创作活动　坚决占领社会主义文化阵地
    新都桥兵站成为宣传毛泽东思想的阵地
    据新华社成都三十日电  川藏公路上的新都桥兵站创作大批革命的文艺节目，为过往部队演出，使兵站成为宣传毛泽东思想的阵地。
    早在一九六三年，上级党委就要求把兵站办成“既是食宿接待站，又是宣传鼓动站”。几年来，新都桥兵站一直依靠“外援”来实现这一要求，每逢有重要的接待任务，就向附近兄弟单位借用演唱组，到接待工作结束，演唱组一走，站里的宣传鼓动工作也就跟着结束。去年二月，上级党委要求把“既是食宿接待站，又是宣传鼓动站”落实，并把它当作突出政治的具体行动。有人却说：“兵站兵站，招待做饭。只要过往人员吃好睡好，任务就完成了。”党支部针对这些活思想，组织大家学习毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，使他们认识到兵站既要有物质食谱，更要有“精神食谱”；通过演唱短小精干的文艺节目来宣传毛泽东思想，这是兵站不可缺少的工作。党支部同时组织兵站工作人员学习毛主席的《愚公移山》、《关于重庆谈判》等著作，从中吸取克服各种困难的力量。不久，新都桥兵站便建立了自己的演唱组。
    兵站党支部又号召大家积极开展业余创作活动，并且强调指出：兵站就是宣传毛泽东思想的阵地，就是兴无产阶级思想灭资产阶级思想的斗争阵地，决不能因为自己文化程度比较低就放弃这个阵地。于是，一个业余创作活动的热潮在兵站中掀起来了。从未搞过创作的战士邓维清也拿起了笔，他在三个月里写了八个文娱演唱材料。军医韩德司以往并不爱好文艺，文化程度也不高，他学习了毛主席有关文艺工作的论述和林彪副主席对部队文化工作的指示以后，深入过往车队了解情况，编写了《行车安全歌》，受到汽车兵的欢迎。兵站青年职工陈德法，在学校里受到资产阶级名利观点的影响，一心想当“文学家”，看不起演唱组。他学习了《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，体会到革命的文艺是“为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的”，就热心为演唱组写作演唱材料，积极参加演唱活动。在不到四个月的时间里，他编写了《四个第一要落实》、《赞英雄汽车兵》等十六个节目，演出效果很好。
    去年，新都桥兵站以自己创作的节目为主，为过往部队演出了二百四十多场。看过他们演出的指战员们说：“看演出等于上一堂生动的政治课。”
  “吃好睡好热在身上，看好听好暖在心中，新都桥兵站真是温暖如家。”
