    The Enemy's Tricks Cannot Deceive Us
    Liu Zaixiang, veteran worker of the "February 7th" Changxindian Railway Vehicle Factory
    Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and others published hundreds of articles in "Qianxian" and "Beijing Daily", trying every means and exhausting every method to curse our Party, slander the Three Red Banners, plead for the right opportunists, encourage them to get up and do it again, and even arrogantly clamor for us to honestly hand over the power of the proletarian dictatorship, and arrogantly demand that the Party "rest". This is absolutely impossible.
    I am a worker who participated in the "February 7th" strike struggle. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, after decades of arduous struggle, we finally defeated the enemy with guns and established the good socialist country. However, we have not forgotten that the enemy without guns still exists and is still trying every means to dismantle our socialist stage. Deng Tuo and other handful of people are this kind of enemy without guns. After we workers studied Chairman Mao's writings, our eyes became even brighter. We workers solemnly tell Deng Tuo and other handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements that no matter what tricks you play, you can never deceive us. We must expose you, peel off your painted skins, and resolutely fight you to the end. We will never stop fighting until we win a complete victory. What makes us workers very angry is that the editorial department of "Qianxian" and "Beijing Daily" not only did not expose the anti-Party and anti-socialist true faces of Deng Tuo and others, but also painstakingly tried to excuse them, and also played tricks. Comrades of the editorial department of "Qianxian" and "Beijing Daily", do you also want to sit on the same bench and get on the same boat with the class enemies who are against the Party and socialism!

    敌人的鬼花招骗不了我们
    长辛店机车车辆厂“二七”老工人　刘在祥
    邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙等人，在《前线》、《北京日报》上发表了几百篇文章，想方设法，千方百计地咒骂我们的党，污蔑三面红旗，为右倾机会主义分子喊屈叫冤，鼓励他们爬起来再干，甚至狂妄地叫喊要我们老老实实地交出无产阶级专政的大权，狂妄地要党“休息”。这是绝对办不到的。
    我是参加过“二七”罢工斗争的工人。在党和毛主席的领导下，我们经过几十年的艰苦斗争，终于打倒了拿枪的敌人，建立了社会主义的好江山。但是，我们并没有忘记，不拿枪的敌人还存在，还在千方百计地拆我们社会主义的台。邓拓等一小撮人，就是这种不拿枪的敌人。我们工人学习了毛主席著作以后，眼睛更加雪亮，我们工人正告邓拓等一小撮反党反社会主义分子，不管你们玩什么鬼花招，都绝对骗不了我们，我们一定要把你们揪出来，剥掉你们的画皮，坚决同你们斗争到底，不获全胜，决不收兵。使我们工人十分气愤的是，《前线》、《北京日报》编辑部，不但没有揭穿邓拓等人的反党反社会主义的真面目，反而煞费苦心地为他们开脱，也玩起鬼花招来了。《前线》、《北京日报》编辑部的同志们，难道你们也要和反党反社会主义的阶级敌人坐一条板凳，上一条船吗！
