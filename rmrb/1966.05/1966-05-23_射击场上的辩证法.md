    I encountered many detours in practicing shooting skills. Only after repeatedly studying "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" did I gain insight and understand that there is also dialectics on the shooting range. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's dialectical materialism, my shooting skills gradually improved. I deeply realized that to develop outstanding shooting skills, one must correctly understand and handle the relationship between thought and technology, and emphasize politics in everything.

    Practice and War – Firmly Establish the Idea of "Practice for War." When I started practicing shooting, I was focused on competing for excellence. When I didn't achieve excellence, I felt distressed. Later, when I became a top shooter, I developed the idea of competing for and maintaining honor. Every time there was live-fire shooting, my heart would pound, afraid that the titles of "Five-Good Soldier" and "Sharpshooter" would slip away from my gun muzzle. After studying the articles "Serve the People" and "Cast Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle," I thought: For a revolutionary soldier, in the face of domestic and international class struggle, and under the tense war preparedness situation, serving the people should first of all mean firmly establishing the idea of "practice for war," quickly developing outstanding skills to kill the enemy, and being ready to eliminate the enemy at any time. If one "practices for show" or "practices to compete for excellence," how can one develop outstanding skills to eliminate the enemy?

    Later, I further pondered the relationship between practice and war, and felt that practice is not the goal, war is the goal. Regular practice is precisely for war on the battlefield, and the unity of practice and war must be achieved. The conditions that promote this unity are: first, ideologically having the people in mind, practicing to defend the people; second, ideologically having the enemy in mind, practicing to eliminate the enemy. With these two points, one will be responsible for every shot one aims, responsible for every bullet one fires, and one will practice attentively for actual combat.

    To firmly remember "practice for war," I wrote three sentences in my diary to spur myself on: think about what you came to the army for, think about the suffering of the poor in the old society, and think about the fact that two-thirds of the world's people have not yet been liberated. By looking at these and thinking about them often, my mind becomes clearer and I have more energy when practicing.

    Difficult and Easy – Develop the Revolutionary Spirit of Daring to Struggle. In practicing shooting, one will encounter many difficulties. The process of overcoming difficulties is actually a process of transforming the difficult into the easy. However, whether one can overcome difficulties depends on one's thinking, whether one dares to struggle with difficulties. Therefore, the process of overcoming difficulties is also a process of ideological struggle between "daring" and "fear."

    In September 1963, I participated in a training session for top shooters. The conditions for practice and assessment were: eliminate a head-sized target at a distance of 350 meters within five seconds, and eliminate a half-body target at a distance of 500 meters within seven seconds. The training ground was located in a large mountain, and the targets were placed among the trees and bamboo thickets, making the targets very difficult to spot. What was even more frustrating was that the sunlight was strong, the notch was bright, and there was a false light, making it impossible to see the target. I thought, I won't be able to hit the target this time, I might as well go back early! With fear in my mind, my technique kept failing to improve. After practicing for a week, I couldn't even pass the correct aiming. At this time, I opened "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and used Chairman Mao's teaching "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice and surmount every difficulty to win victory" to encourage myself. I thought, Chairman Mao led the Chinese revolution with only a few people at the beginning, yet they had to overthrow the three great mountains. If we talk about difficulty, that was truly difficult! But Chairman Mao dared to struggle, dared to win, and led the Chinese people to finally overthrow the three great mountains. Thinking of this, courage came to me. I pondered further, others are not afraid, what am I afraid of! If I want to move forward, I have to pull out the nail of difficulty; there is no avoiding it. In order to eliminate the false light, I specifically went to practice under the sun at noon, aimed well, and then blocked it with leaves to see how much it deviated, where it deviated, and how to eliminate it; if I couldn't see the target clearly, I practiced my eye focus. With the help of leaders and comrades, I finally broke through the difficult hurdle.

    From this practice, I realized: When the word "dare" wins, the difficult becomes easy; when the word "fear" prevails, even the easy becomes difficult. To transform the difficult into the easy, the key lies in developing the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle. With this revolutionary spirit, one can better exert subjective initiative, actively create conditions, and promote the transformation of the difficult into the easy.

    Hard Practice and Skillful Practice – Skillful practice on the basis of hard practice. Excellent shooting skills are developed through practice. There are no other shortcuts besides practicing honestly. At the beginning, my thinking was wrong. I only wanted to practice skillfully, not hard, and sometimes even thought of some crooked ideas. For example, when practicing unsupported shooting, I thought, how great would it be if the gun were as stable in my hands as if it were tied to a pillar! With this thought, I specifically tried to find shortcuts in the posture of holding the gun. After many trials, I finally had to admit failure. This failure taught me a lesson: to develop good skills to kill the enemy, "one must put in hard work." To practice arm strength, I added several hand grenades to the tip of the gun when practicing gun handling and aiming every day. In my spare time, I practiced on the horizontal bar, weightlifting, brick lifting, and stone lifting. I did several push-ups on the bed before going to bed. After a period of hard practice, my arm strength increased. However, every time I lay on the ground to practice aiming, my elbows felt very painful, which affected my concentration. What should I do? At this time, I remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of overcoming all difficulties and resolved to train my elbows. So, I specifically lay on the hard ground to practice. After a long time, calluses developed on my elbows, and they no longer hurt. As a result, handling the gun became much better than before. On this basis, I further pondered the posture of handling the gun, and the gun became more stable.

    From here, I realized: Hard practice is the basis of skillful practice, skillful practice is the improvement of hard practice. Only by combining hard practice and skillful practice can technology be rapidly improved. Of course, hard practice and skillful practice cannot be completely separated. Hard practice also requires using the brain, figuring out the rules, so that the methods can be improved; to achieve skillful practice, one must also practice hard. Without hard practice, even the best techniques will not become one's own, and no skill will arise.

    Failure and Success – Keep the word "change" in mind at all times. For a shooter, even the best shooter, it is often inevitable to miss some bullets and encounter some setbacks. The question is whether one can learn from failures and turn failures into successes according to Chairman Mao's teachings. I gradually came to realize this from shooting practice.

    Once, during a top shooter assessment, the first target was a head-sized target 250 meters away, and I shot it down with one shot. The second target was a half-body target 400 meters away, and I shot three times without knocking it down. It wasn't until the fourth shot that I knocked it down. What was the reason? The main reason was that I didn't pay attention to the large target, and didn't see the change between large and small. The half-body target is larger than the head-sized target, but the half-body target is farther away, so the large target becomes a small target. The target changed, but my thinking didn't change accordingly, so of course I couldn't hit it. A fall into the pit, a gain in your wit. Later, in live-fire shooting, I paid attention to starting from the specific situation at the time and place. When the objective conditions changed, my thinking changed accordingly, and my shooting methods also changed accordingly. In this way, in the subsequent four top shooter assessments, I achieved the requirement of eliminating two targets with two bullets three times.

    Another time, I participated in experiential shooting. The target was a half-body target 400 meters away, shooting from a mountain gully to the top of the mountain. Based on the characteristic that the trajectory of the bullet in elevation shooting is higher, I lowered the aiming point. The first shot missed, and the second shot was lowered a little less, but it still missed the target. Several other comrades also missed, and everyone felt strange. In order to find the reason, we went to the target to see the point of impact. When we reached halfway up the mountain, we felt wind, and the higher we went, the stronger the wind became. Obviously, we didn't take the wind into account, so of course we couldn't hit the target. After accepting this lesson, I went to various terrains to observe the swaying of grass and branches to judge the direction and strength of the wind. However, the wind is fickle, sometimes strong, sometimes weak, sometimes there, sometimes not, sometimes headwind, sometimes tailwind, and the situation is quite complex. After a long period of observation and experience, I slowly learned some methods of mastering the wind direction and wind force, which brought great benefits to my later shooting.

    From these examples, I realized: Failure and success are interrelated and mutually transformable. There are factors of failure in success, and there are factors of success in failure. Success this time may lead to failure next time, and failure last time may lead to success this time. To transform failure into success, keep the word "change" in mind at all times, and try to change your understanding with the changes in objective conditions. In this way, one can hit the target with more certainty in various complex situations.

    Achievements and Shortcomings – Ideologically never be satisfied. I have been in the army for more than three years and have conducted 34 live-fire shootings, 33 of which were excellent and one was good. Among them, I took the top shooter assessment 17 times, all of which were qualified. In the face of these achievements, I gradually developed a sense of satisfaction, feeling that I was good enough. Once, I participated in the shooting assessment in the regiment. The requirement was to eliminate two targets with six bullets. I eliminated the two targets with three bullets and happily reported the results to the instructor. The instructor praised me and asked me to carefully find the reason for missing one bullet. When I heard this, I was not very happy, thinking: The conditions for this assessment are difficult enough, it's good enough to hit the target, and I saved three bullets, why are you asking me to demand more? Afterwards, after thinking carefully, I felt that the instructor's requirements were correct. Missing one bullet seems like a small matter, but it contains a big problem of being responsible for the victory of the battle and being responsible for the lives of comrades. Bullets are meant to kill the enemy, and missing one bullet is the same as letting an enemy go. Although it is inevitable to miss a few bullets on the shooting range, one cannot let it go to waste, one must learn a lesson from it, and make one's skills more and more perfect.

    At the same time, from the attitude towards this one bullet, I realized my own problem, that I could not see my shortcomings in the continuous achievements, and I was complacent and self-satisfied. In fact, achievements are compared to shortcomings. Good achievements do not mean that there are no shortcomings. Since I joined the army, I have missed 103 bullets, which is almost the same as letting go of a company of enemies. If a war breaks out, how much loss will this bring to the battle? Can this shortcoming still be said to be small? From then on, I became more vigilant. The more achievements I had, the more I paid attention to my shortcomings.

    Through practice, I feel that only by striving to study Chairman Mao's works well and using Chairman Mao's dialectical materialism as a guide can shooting skills continue to improve.

### 射击场上的辩证法

    射击场上的辩证法
    人民解放军成都部队某部排长　谭奇成
    我练习射击技术，走过不少弯路，反复学习《实践论》《矛盾论》，才开了心窍，懂得了射击场上也有辩证法。我在毛主席辩证唯物论的观点指导下，射击技术逐步有了提高。我深深体会到，要练出过硬的射击本领，就必须正确认识和处理思想与技术的关系，事事处处突出政治。
    练和战——明确树立“练为战”的思想。我开始练射击，脑子里装的是争优秀。优秀没有争到，思想就苦闷。以后当了特等射手，又有了争荣誉和保荣誉的思想。每到实弹射击，心里就扑通扑通地跳，唯恐五好战士、神枪手称号从枪口里跑掉。学习了《为人民服务》和《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》两篇文章以后，我想：对一个革命战士来说，在国内外阶级斗争面前，在紧张的战备形势下，为人民服务首先应该明确树立“练为战”的思想，迅速练出过硬的杀敌本领，随时准备消灭敌人。如果“练为看”、“练为争优秀”，那么怎么能练出过硬本领，消灭敌人呢？
    后来，我进一步琢磨练和战的关系，感到练不是目的，战才是目的。平时的练，正是为了战场上的战，要做到练和战的统一。促成这个统一的条件，一是思想上要有人民，为保卫人民而练；一是思想上要有敌人，为消灭敌人而练。有了这两条，就会对自己瞄的每一枪负责，对打出去的每一发子弹负责，就会为了实战而专心致意地练了。
    为了牢牢记住“练为战”，我在日记上写了三句话来鞭策自己：想一想到部队来是干什么的，想一想在旧社会穷人所受的苦难，想一想世界上还有三分之二的人民没有解放。经常看一看，想一想，思想就比较明亮，练起来就有劲。
    难和易——发扬敢于斗争的革命精神。在练射击中，会遇到很多困难。战胜困难的过程，实际上是把难变为易的转化过程。但是，能否战胜困难，又决定于一个人的思想，是不是敢于同困难作斗争，所以战胜困难的过程，又是思想上的“敢”和“怕”作斗争的过程。
    一九六三年九月，我参加特等射手集训。练习和考核的条件是，三百五十米远的人头靶，五秒钟内消灭，五百米远的半身靶，七秒钟内消灭。训练场设在一座大山里，靶子就插在树林和竹丛中间，目标很难发现。更恼火的是，太阳光线强，缺口亮，有虚光，看不见目标。心想，这次是打不上了，干脆早点回去吧！思想上一怕，技术老是上不去，练了一个星期，连正确瞄准也没有过关。这时，我翻开《愚公移山》，用毛主席教导的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”来鼓励自己。我想，毛主席领导中国革命，最初才那么几个人，就要推翻三座大山，说难，那才是真难！可是毛主席敢于斗争，敢于胜利，领导中国人民终于把三座大山推翻了。想到这里，勇气就来了。我又一琢磨，别人都不怕，我怕啥！要想前进，就得把困难这个钉子拔掉，躲是躲不开的。为了排除虚光，我专门在中午跑到太阳底下去练，瞄好了，再用树叶挡住，看偏多少，偏在哪里，怎样排除；看不清目标，我就练眼睛的注视力。在领导和同志的帮助下，我终于突破了难关。
    从这次练习中，我体会到：“敢”字斗胜了，难就变易了；“怕”字占了上风，就是易也会变成难。要使难变易，关键在于发扬敢于斗争的革命精神，有了这种革命精神，就可以更好地发挥主观能动性，积极地创造条件，促进难向易转化。
    苦练和巧练——在苦练的基础上巧练。过硬的射击技术是练出来的。除了老老实实地练，没有什么别的窍门。开始，我的想法不对头，只想巧练，不想苦练，有时还想些歪点子。比如练无依托射击，我想，要是把枪操在手里，就象绑在柱子上那样稳，该有多好！有了这个想法，我就专门从操枪的姿势上去找窍门。经过多次试验，最后不得不承认失败。这次失败使我吸取了教训，要练好杀敌本领，“非下苦功不可”。为了练臂力，每天练操枪瞄准时，我就在枪尖上吊几个手榴弹，在课余时间练单杠、举重、托砖、举石头，睡觉前在床上做几次伏卧撑，经过一段时间苦练，臂力增大了。可是，每次趴在地上练瞄准时，觉得两个手肘很痛，影响注意力集中。怎么办？这时我又想起毛主席排除万难的教导，决心练手肘。于是，我专门趴到硬地上去练，时间一久，手肘磨出了老茧，不痛了。这样一来，操枪比以前好多了。在这个基础上，进一步琢磨操枪的姿势，枪就比较稳了。
    从这里，我认识到：苦练是巧练的基础，巧练是苦练的提高，只有在苦练的基础上巧练，把苦练和巧练结合起来，技术才能迅速提高。当然，苦练和巧练并不能截然分开，苦练也要动脑子，摸规律，方法才能改进；要做到巧练，也必须苦练，如果没有苦练，再好的要领也不会变为自己的，也生不出巧来。
    失败和成功——脑子里要经常有个“变”字。一个射手，那怕是最好的射手，打跑一些子弹，遇到一些挫折，常常是少不了的。问题在于能否按照毛主席的教导，从失败中找教训，变失败为成功。这一点，我是从射击实践中逐步体会到的。
    有一次进行特等射手考核，第一个目标是二百五十米远的人头靶，我一枪就给揍下去了。第二个目标是四百米远的半身靶，我连打三枪，它还是立着，直到第四枪才把它揍倒。这是什么原因？主要是对大靶子不在意，没有看到大和小的变化。半身靶比人头靶大，可是半身靶的距离远，大靶就变为小靶了。靶子变了，思想没有跟着变，当然打不上。吃一堑，长一智。以后，在实弹射击中，我就注意从当时当地的具体情况出发，客观条件变，我思想就跟着变，射击方法也跟着变，这样，在后来的四次特等射手考核中，有三次都达到了两发子弹消灭两个目标的要求。
    还有一次参加体验射击，目标是四百米远的半身靶，从山沟往山顶上打。我根据仰角射击弹道偏高的特点，修低了瞄准点，第一发未命中，第二发少修了一点，还是脱靶。其他几个同志也没有打中，大家都感到奇怪。为了找到原因，我们就到靶跟前去看弹着点，走到半山腰时，感到有风，越往山顶走风越大。很明显，没有把风估计进去，当然打不好。接受这次教训，以后我就到各种地形上去看草和树枝的摆动情况，判断风向和风力大小。但是风是变化无常的，时大时小，时有时无，时逆时顺，情况相当复杂。经过长时间的观察和体会，才慢慢地摸索到一些掌握风向、风力的方法，这给我以后的射击带来了很大好处。
    从这些事例中，我体会到：失败和成功是互相关联，互相转化的。成功中有失败的因素，失败中有成功的因素。这次成功了，下次可能失败，上次失败了，这次又可能成功。要变失败为成功，脑子里就要经常有个“变”字，尽量使自己的认识随着客观情况的变化而变化。这样，就能在各种复杂情况下，比较有把握地打中目标。
    成绩和缺点——思想上要永不满足。我当兵三年多，先后进行过三十四次实弹射击，三十三次优秀，一次良好。其中特等射手考核十七次，都取得合格成绩。在这些成绩面前，自己逐渐滋长了一种满足情绪，感到差不多了。有一次，我参加团里的射击考核，条件是六发子弹消灭两个目标。我三发子弹就消灭了两个目标，高高兴兴地向指导员汇报成绩，指导员表扬了我，又要我好好找一找打跑一发子弹的原因。我一听就不大高兴，心想：这个考核条件够难了，能打上就不错，何况我还节约了三发子弹，怎么还要往高处要求呢？过后，仔细一想，觉得指导员的要求正确。跑一发子弹看来是件小事情，这里面却包含着为战斗胜利负责和为战友生命负责的大问题。子弹是要敌人命的，打跑一发子弹，就等于放走一个敌人。虽然靶场上跑几发子弹是难免的，但是不能让它白跑，要从中找到教训，使自己的技术精益求精。
    同时，从对待这一发子弹的态度上，我觉察到自己的毛病，就是在不断取得成绩中，看不见缺点了，自满自足了。其实，成绩是同缺点比较而言的，成绩好不等于没有缺点。我入伍以来就打跑了一百零三发子弹，差不多放跑了一个连的敌人，如果打起仗来，这会给战斗带来多大的损失，这缺点还能说小吗？从这以后，我就比较警惕了，越是有成绩，越是注意自己的缺点。
    通过实践，我觉得只有努力学好毛主席著作，用毛主席辩证唯物论的观点作指导，才能使射击技术不断提高。
