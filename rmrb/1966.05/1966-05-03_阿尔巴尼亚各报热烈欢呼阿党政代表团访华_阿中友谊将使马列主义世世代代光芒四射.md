    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 29th: The Albanian newspaper "Zëri i Popullit" published an editorial on the 28th, saying that the Albanian people believe that the Albanian Party and Government delegation's visit to the People's Republic of China "will make a significant contribution to further strengthening the unbreakable friendship between our two peoples and parties."
    The editorial, entitled "An Unforgettable Event in Albanian-Chinese Brotherly Relations," said that the Chinese people are a great and heroic people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have carried out a long-term and large-scale struggle.
      "Today, when the Khrushchev revisionists are trampling on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, People's China is a staunch defender of Marxist-Leninist principles. Because of its principled stand, because of the lofty example it has set in defending Marxism-Leninism and building socialism, it has won the love and friendship of all revolutionaries around the world. It has won the love and friendship of the Albanian people."
    The editorial said: "Our two countries and peoples are separated by thousands of kilometers, but the noble sentiments that inspire us, the common ideals, and the common doctrine of Marxism-Leninism that guides us, cannot be blocked by mountains, oceans, and continents, nor can they be affected by differences in size, population, skin color, and ethnicity."
    The editorial exposed and condemned the Khrushchev revisionists' attacks on the Albanian Party of Labor at the 22nd Congress of the CPSU, and the Chinese Communist Party delegation's firm condemnation of the revisionists' perfidious behavior, saying: "The path taken by our two parties is a glorious path, a fighting path. In recent years, people have seen through the treacherous acts of the traitor to Marxism-Leninism, the Khrushchev revisionists, and their alliance and cooperation with U.S. imperialism, the purpose of which is to dominate the world, to restore capitalism in socialist countries, and to strangle the national liberation movements of various countries."
    The editorial pointed out that the achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong inspire the people of all countries, while making their enemies, the imperialists, tremble with fear. Now, China plays a pivotal role in the world, and no international problem can be solved without China's participation.
    The editorial said that the Albanian people are proud to have the great Chinese people and their glorious party as friends.
    The editorial then went on to describe the cooperation between the Albanian and Chinese peoples in various fields, saying: "The enemies of the People's Republic of China, the enemies of socialism, are trying every possible means to spread lies and slander the People's Republic of China as being 'hegemonistic,' adopting a 'great-power chauvinist' stance, and interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. Such lies and slanders are in vain. From their attitude towards Albania and other countries, it is more than clear that it is precisely the policies of the imperialists and Khrushchev revisionists that institutionalize hegemony, adopt a great-power chauvinist stance, and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries."
    The editorial concluded: "Our Party and Government delegation's visit to the People's Republic of China will make an important contribution to further strengthening this friendship. Albanian-Chinese friendship will make Marxism-Leninism shine for generations."
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 1st: "Bashkimi" published an editorial on April 30 entitled "Eternal Friendship, Militant Friendship," saying that the news from Beijing, the capital of the fraternal People's Republic of China, is like a spring breeze, stirring the hearts of all our people on the eve of "May Day," making them rejoice and full of enthusiasm. The particularly grand and warm welcome given by the great Chinese people to the Albanian Party and Government delegation led by Comrade Shehu is a manifestation of the unbreakable friendship and militant unity between the Albanian and Chinese peoples and parties. It once again clearly shows the noble internationalist spirit of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and the great Chinese people educated by Comrade Mao Zedong.
    The editorial pointed out that the friendship between the Albanian and Chinese peoples, forged by our two Marxist-Leninist parties, is a great fighting friendship. It has nothing in common with the deceitful relations between capitalist countries, nor with the typical deceptive relations between revisionists. It marks a new type of relationship between free and equal peoples.
    The editorial said that precisely because of this, the imperialists and revisionists regard our friendship as a thorn in their side. But they always suffer a shameful defeat. Under the teachings of the heroic Party of Labor, the Albanian people clearly understand their friends and enemies, clearly distinguish between true revolutionaries and fake revolutionaries, and enemies of socialism and communism who wear masks.
    "Labor News" said in an editorial on April 29 entitled "Eternal Brotherly Friendship" that the Albanian working people regard this visit as a new manifestation of the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the two countries, as a manifestation of the love and friendship of Albanian men and women, young and old, for the fraternal Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and as another step towards further strengthening the unity linking the two parties and governments.
    "Warrior News" published an editorial on April 28 entitled "Great Militant Friendship, Eternal Friendship," saying that the Albanian Party and Government delegation's visit to China once again demonstrated the strength of our unbreakable and eternal militant friendship. This visit is another powerful blow to imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism.
    "Youth Voice" published an editorial on April 30 entitled "Unbreakable Strong Friendship," saying that the Albanian Party and Government delegation's visit to China has aroused great enthusiasm among the Albanian working people.

    阿尔巴尼亚各报热烈欢呼阿党政代表团访华
    阿中友谊将使马列主义世世代代光芒四射
    据新华社地拉那二十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十八日发表社论说：阿尔巴尼亚人民认为，阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团对中华人民共和国的这次访问，“将对进一步加强我们两国人民和两党之间的牢不可破的友谊作出重大贡献。”
    这篇题目是《阿中兄弟关系中的永志不忘的事件》的社论说：中国人民是伟大的英雄人民。中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的共产党的领导下，进行了长期的、规模巨大的斗争。
      “在赫鲁晓夫修正主义者践踏马克思列宁主义原理的今天，人民中国是马克思列宁主义原理的坚决捍卫者。由于它采取这种有原则的立场，由于它在捍卫马克思列宁主义方面和建设社会主义方面树立了崇高的榜样，它已经赢得了全世界所有革命者的爱戴和友谊。它赢得了阿尔巴尼亚人民的热爱和友谊。”
    社论说：“我们两国和两国人民相距数千公里，但是，鼓舞着我们的崇高感情、共同的理想、指引我们前进的共同的学说马克思列宁主义，是高山、海洋、大陆所阻隔不了的，是面积的大和小，人口的多和少，肤色和种族的不同所影响不了的。”
    社论揭露和谴责赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在苏共二十二大对阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的攻击和当时中国共产党代表团挺身而出严正谴责修正主义者的背信弃义行为后说：“我们两党所走的道路是光荣的道路，战斗的道路。这几年来，人们识破了马克思列宁主义的叛徒赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的叛卖行为，识破了他们同美帝国主义建立的联盟和合作，这种行为的目的在于主宰世界，在于使资本主义在社会主义国家复辟和扼杀各国人民的民族解放运动。”
    社论指出，中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下所取得的成就，鼓舞着各国人民，而使他们的敌人帝国主义者胆战心惊。现在，中国在世界上举足轻重，没有中国参加，任何国际问题都不能解决。
    社论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民为有伟大的中国人民及其光荣的党做朋友而感到自豪。
    社论接着在叙述了阿中两国人民在各个方面的合作关系后说：“中华人民共和国的敌人，社会主义的敌人，千方百计地散布谎言诋毁中华人民共和国是‘霸权主义’采取‘大国沙文主义’立场和干涉别国内政，这种谎言诬蔑是枉费心机的。从他们对阿尔巴尼亚和其他国家所采取的态度来看，就再清楚不过地表明，恰恰是帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的政策把实行霸权作为制度，采取大国沙文主义立场，对其他国家的内部事务进行干涉。”
    社论最后说：“我们的党政代表团对中华人民共和国的访问将对进一步加强这种友谊作出重要贡献。阿中友谊将使马克思列宁主义世世代代光芒四射。”
    据新华社地拉那一日电　《团结报》四月三十日发表题为《永恒的友谊，战斗的友谊》的社论说，来自兄弟的中华人民共和国首都北京的消息象一阵春风，在“五一”节前夕激荡着我国全体人民的心，使他们欢欣鼓舞和满怀热情。伟大的中国人民对谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团的特别盛大和热情的欢迎，是阿中两国人民和两党之间的牢不可破的友谊和战斗团结的表现，它再次清楚地表明，光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东同志教导出来的伟大中国人民的崇高的国际主义精神。
    社论指出，为我们两个马列主义政党所锤炼起来的阿尔巴尼亚和中国人民之间的友谊，是伟大的战斗友谊。它同资本主义国家之间尔虞我诈的关系毫无共同之处，同修正主义者之间典型的欺骗关系也毫无共同之处。它标志着自由和平等的人民之间的新型关系。
    社论说，正是因为这样，帝国主义者和修正主义者把我们的友谊看作是眼中钉。但是他们总是遭到可耻的失败。阿尔巴尼亚人民在英勇的劳动党的教导下清楚地了解自己的朋友和敌人，清楚地区分出真正的革命者和假革命者以及戴着假面具的社会主义和共产主义的敌人。
    《劳动报》四月二十九日在题为《永恒的兄弟友谊》的社论中说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民把这次访问看作是两国之间兄弟友谊和合作的新的体现，看作是阿尔巴尼亚男女老少对兄弟的中国人民，对以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的热爱和友好的表现，是进一步加强联结两党和两国政府的团结的又一步骤。
    《战士报》四月二十八日发表题为《伟大的战斗的友谊，永恒的友谊》的社论说，阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问中国再次表现了我们牢不可破的和永恒的战斗友谊的力量，这次访问是对帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的又一次有力打击。
    《青年之声报》四月三十日发表题为《牢不可破的坚强友谊》的社论说，阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问中国在阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民群众中激起了巨大的热情。
