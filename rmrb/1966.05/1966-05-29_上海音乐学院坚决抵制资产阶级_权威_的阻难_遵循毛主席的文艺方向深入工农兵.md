    Shanghai Conservatory of Music Resolutely Resists the Obstruction of Bourgeois "Authorities"
    Follows Chairman Mao's Literary and Artistic Direction to Go Deep into the Workers, Peasants and Soldiers
    The Ulanmuqi-style music team of this conservatory gave a special performance at the "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival, which was full of fighting spirit, rich in life, and lively in artistic form, and was warmly praised by the audience.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th—After holding five consecutive special performances at the 7th "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival, an Ulanmuqi-style music team went deep into factories and rural areas to perform for the workers, peasants and soldiers, and was warmly praised by the broad masses of the audience. This is a concentrated review of the gratifying achievements made by the young teachers and students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music in the past few years in following the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, going deep into the workers, peasants and soldiers, and learning from the workers, peasants and soldiers, and shows that the new army of proletarian literature and art is rapidly growing.
    In implementing the Party's literary and artistic direction and educational policy, the Shanghai Conservatory of Music resolutely resisted the various obstacles and criticisms of bourgeois "experts" and "authorities," launched a continuous struggle against bourgeois literary and artistic thought, and persisted in organizing teachers and students to go deep into the lives of workers, peasants and soldiers and participate in labor. In the past two years, they have also carried out Ulanmuqi-style music team activities. They take the practice of the three great revolutionary movements as the best teaching material, the workshops and fields as the broadest classrooms and stages, and the workers and poor and lower-middle peasants as the most brilliant teachers to learn from; at the same time, they take materials locally to create and quickly reflect real struggles, serve proletarian politics, and serve the workers, peasants and soldiers.
    The Ulanmuqi-style music team participating in this "Shanghai Spring" was composed of seventeen students and young teachers drawn from several music teams, with an average age of less than twenty-five. They came from the fiery struggle life in factories and rural areas, and on the stage, they were like in workshops and fields, reporting programs themselves, moving chairs and stools themselves, blowing and playing, performing and singing. Most of the actors achieved multi-skilling. The more than twenty programs they performed included song performances, playing and singing, solo singing, orchestral and national instrumental ensemble, solo, etc., which were small and diverse, rich and colorful. The entire performance was full of fighting spirit, rich in life, and lively in artistic form. After each group of programs was performed, they were repeatedly encore and repeated by the audience under the enthusiastic applause.
    Combine with Workers, Peasants and Soldiers to Cultivate a New Army of Proletarian Literature and Art
    How to cultivate a new army of proletarian literature and art? This is a major issue related to cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause and carrying the socialist cultural revolution through to the end. Is it along the bourgeois direction, detached from reality, and improving behind closed doors; or is it going deep into the workers, peasants and soldiers and participating in the fiery actual struggle? This is a reflection of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two ideologies of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Regarding this issue, the young teachers and students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music once again made a loud answer with practical actions: Only by going deep into actual struggle can we quickly reflect actual struggle; only by living and fighting together with the workers, peasants and soldiers can we use the weapon of literature and art to better serve the workers, peasants and soldiers; only by combining with the workers, peasants and soldiers and learning from the workers, peasants and soldiers can we cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic cause.
    Most of the programs in the Ulanmuqi-style music team's special performances were created by teachers and students after going deep into life. They were not only taken from the struggle life of the workers and peasants, but also performed at the struggle site of the workers and peasants. In recent years, the teachers and students who went deep into factories and rural areas have eaten, lived, worked, and struggled together with the workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, learning from them. Countless new people, new things, new ideas, and new fashions have inspired their strong creative enthusiasm. The female voice performance "Practicing Skills for the Revolution" was created based on the true story of a female worker after going deep into the Shanghai No. 2 State Cotton Mill. It describes this female worker who was cruelly exploited by the capitalists in the old society and whose hands were burned. In the upsurge of socialist production and construction after liberation, she worked hard to learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, improved her class consciousness, and practiced basic skills with strong class feelings. She finally overcame the difficulties and mastered the technology. This program relatively vividly reflects the spiritual outlook of thousands of textile female workers and has been performed in the factory many times, deeply loved by the workers. The young teachers and students who participated in the socialist education movement in Beiqiao Commune collectively created a set of music suitable for performance by a small band during the busy season of summer harvest and summer planting last year: "Rushing to Harvest and Planting is Like Going to the Battlefield," "Carrying Rice," "Singing Harvest on the Threshing Ground." They used only eight kinds of orchestral instruments, plus male and female duet, to realistically express the hot labor scene in the countryside. When this set of music was performed in the countryside, it greatly encouraged the revolutionary enthusiasm of the commune members and promoted the production struggle.
    Only the Masses of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers Have the Right to Approve Literary and Artistic Works
    Some bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" once asserted that going deep into actual struggle is "not worthwhile," "you can't learn anything," and "you can't improve artistically." In fact, these are just excuses for them to oppose going deep into the workers, peasants and soldiers and refuse to go to the actual struggle to temper and transform. It is precisely because some of the programs performed by the music team are the product of fiery struggle life that the revolutionary political content and artistic form have been better unified. They have also broken through the shackles of old frameworks and made creative and beneficial attempts in expressing the thoughts and life of the working class with instruments. The folk music ensemble "Sadao Hui" (Knife Competition) uses the rapid beating of the yangqin and the varied guzheng to represent the "two sides" of the competition. When the other instruments of the small band suddenly become silent, and all the performers turn to listen to the yangqin and guzheng solos, the music reproduces the moving scene of "comparing, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing, the red flag of the workshop flutters, Mao Zedong Thought shines, and the treasured knife is competed for the revolution," leaving an unforgettable impression on the audience. "Master and Apprentice One Red" uses the different timbres of the qudi and bangdi to symbolize "a pair of masters and apprentices." It expresses the ideological content of mutual help, mutual learning, and common progress between masters and apprentices through enthusiastic and heroic melodies, taking the form of round playing, ensemble, solo, and duet, plus the accompaniment of other instruments. These young teachers and students have learned a lot in the lives of workers, peasants and soldiers and in actual struggle that they could not learn in the classroom at all. They created these programs, giving the instruments new life, and also improved their playing skills.
    Who has the right to approve literary and artistic works? Only the broad masses of workers, peasants and soldiers. Only by breaking the monopoly of literary and artistic criticism by a few bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" can we promote the development of socialist literature and art. Works reflecting industrial and agricultural production and construction and expressing the life and struggle of workers, peasants and soldiers were previously considered "boring" and "crude" by "experts" and "authorities." Under the leadership of the Party and educated by actual struggle, the young teachers and students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music were not intimidated by these fallacies. They adhered to the principle of political standards first and artistic standards second, and recognized that any artistic work, as long as it can serve the workers, peasants and soldiers and is loved by the workers, peasants and soldiers, is good or basically good. They created works according to the needs of the struggle, and then took these works to the masses for rehearsal, and then revised them according to the opinions of the masses until they were approved by the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers. Some of the programs in this special performance were precisely because they went through such a process that they were welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants and soldiers, and gave a sharp and powerful criticism to the various fallacies of those bourgeois "experts" and "authorities"!
    Participating in Actual Struggle Promotes the Ideological Revolutionization of People
    Going deep into life and participating in actual struggle, the most important thing is to promote the ideological revolutionization of people. This is the most important issue in cultivating a new army of proletarian literature and art, and it is also the focus of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for the younger generation. Among the young people who participated in this special performance of the music team, some had performed abroad in the past, and some had won awards in instrumental music competitions. Some bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" had praised them and instilled bourgeois ideas and bourgeois artistic views in them in various ways, trying their best to cultivate them into successors to the bourgeoisie. Under the erosion of bourgeois ideology, some young teachers and students once buried themselves in their professions, did not ask about politics, simply pursued skills, hated labor, and wholeheartedly wanted to become famous and become a family. The Party organization of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, in accordance with the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, did not relax this serious class struggle. Under the education and help of the Party organization, these young people gradually woke up from the dream of bourgeois individualism and went to the fiery struggle to temper and transform themselves.
    One of the composers of the very popular folk music ensemble "Old Poor Peasants Talk About Family History" is a young woman who is just over twenty years old. Under the erosion of bourgeois ideology, she once went to recite Tang poetry, play the violin under the moon, and express the decadent and clichéd mood of works such as "Sick Chant" and "Birdsong in an Empty Mountain," and as a result, her thoughts became more and more empty. The Party and Youth League organizations promptly pulled her back from this dangerous road. She studied Chairman Mao's works with questions, and learned the fine qualities of the working people in actual struggle, and gradually realized the ugliness of bourgeois individualism and felt the importance of transforming her own thoughts and feelings. Now, this young man has begun to grow up healthily along the correct path. She and her companions created this piece of music with revolutionary passion, poured their revolutionary passion into it during the performance, and used clear and contrasting tones to express the revolutionary will and class feelings of the old poor peasants in educating the younger generation not to forget class hatred and to resolutely carry the revolution through to the end.
    The appearance of the Ulanmuqi-style music team's special performance at the "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival was the first time. The broad masses of the audience left enthusiastic praises on the "Opinion Forms," affirming their correct direction, encouraging and supporting them to continue to advance along the Party's and Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction, along the road of revolutionization. The representatives of the music team participating in this performance expressed on behalf of all the young teachers and students of the school: We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, insist on going deep into life, participating in labor, learning from the workers, peasants and soldiers, serving the workers, peasants and soldiers, actively participating in the socialist cultural revolution, and work harder to temper and transform ourselves into successors to the proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic cause.

### 上海音乐学院坚决抵制资产阶级“权威”的阻难  遵循毛主席的文艺方向深入工农兵

    上海音乐学院坚决抵制资产阶级“权威”的阻难
    遵循毛主席的文艺方向深入工农兵
    这个学院的乌兰牧骑式的音乐小队在“上海之春”音乐会上的专场演出，战斗精神强烈，生活气息浓厚，艺术形式生动活泼，受到观众热烈赞扬。
    新华社上海二十八日电　在第七届“上海之春”音乐会上，一支乌兰牧骑式音乐小队最近连续举行五次专场演出之后，又深入工厂农村为工农群众演出，受到了广大观众的热烈赞扬。这是上海音乐学院青年师生几年来遵循党和毛主席的教导，深入工农兵、学习工农兵取得可喜收获的一次集中检阅，显示出无产阶级的文艺新军正在迅速成长。
    上海音乐学院在贯彻党的文艺方向和教育方针中，坚决抵制了资产阶级“专家”、“权威”的种种阻挠和非难，同资产阶级文艺思想展开了不断的斗争，坚持组织师生深入工农兵生活、参加劳动，近两年来，又开展了乌兰牧骑式的音乐小队活动。他们把三大革命运动的实践作为最好的教材，把车间、田头作为最广阔的课堂和舞台，把工人和贫农下中农作为最高明的教师，进行学习；同时就地取材，进行创作，迅速反映现实斗争，为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务。
    参加本届“上海之春”的这支乌兰牧骑式音乐小队，是从几支音乐小队抽调的十七个学生和青年教师组成的，平均年龄不到二十五岁。他们从工厂和农村的火热斗争生活中来，在舞台上就象在车间、田头一样，自己报节目，自己搬椅凳，又吹又拉，又演又唱，大部分演员都做到了一专多能。他们演出的二十多个节目，有歌曲表演、弹唱、独唱、管弦乐和民族器乐合奏、独奏等等，小型多样，丰富多采。整个演出战斗精神强烈，生活气息浓厚，艺术形式生动活泼。每一组节目演出以后，都在听众热烈掌声要求下一再加演和重唱。
    跟工农兵结合，培养无产阶级文艺新军
    怎样培养无产阶级的文艺新军？这是一个关系到培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人、把社会主义文化大革命进行到底的重大问题。是沿着资产阶级方向，脱离实际、关门提高；还是深入工农兵，参加到火热的实际斗争中去，这是无产阶级、资产阶级两个阶级、两条道路、两种思想之间斗争的反映。对于这个问题，上海音乐学院的青年师生以实际行动，又一次作出了响亮的回答：只有深入实际斗争，才能迅速反映实际斗争；只有跟工农兵生活和战斗在一起，才能用文艺的武器更好地为工农兵服务；只有跟工农兵结合，向工农兵学习，才能培养出无产阶级的革命文艺事业的接班人。
    乌兰牧骑式音乐小队专场演出的节目，大部分是全校师生深入生活后创作的，它们既取材于工农群众的斗争生活，又曾演出于工农群众的斗争现场。近几年来，深入工厂和农村的师生们，跟工人、贫农下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同斗争，向他们学习，无数的新人、新事、新思想、新风尚激发了他们强烈的创作热情。女声表演唱《为革命练本领》，就是深入上海国棉二厂后根据一个女工的真实故事创作的。它描述了这个在旧社会受到资本家的残酷压榨、双手都被烫伤的女工，在解放后的社会主义生产建设高潮中，努力活学活用毛主席著作，提高了阶级觉悟，带着强烈的阶级感情苦练基本功，终于斗倒了困难，掌握了技术。这个节目比较生动地反映出千千万万纺织女工的精神面貌，多次在厂里演出，深受工人喜爱。在北桥公社参加社会主义教育运动的青年师生，在去年夏收夏种的繁忙季节，集体创作了一组适于由小乐队演奏的乐曲：《抢收抢种好比上战场》、《挑稻》、《脱粒场上唱丰收》。他们只用八种管弦乐器，加上男女声对唱，就把农村热火朝天的劳动场面比较逼真地表现出来。这组乐曲在农村演出时，大大鼓舞了社员们的革命干劲，促进了生产斗争。
    只有工农兵群众，对文艺作品有批准权
    一些资产阶级“专家”、“权威”曾经断言：深入实际斗争“划不来”，“学不到什么东西”，“艺术上提不高”。其实，这些都不过是他们反对深入工农兵，拒绝到实际斗争中去锻炼改造的借口。正由于音乐小队演出的一些节目是火热的斗争生活的产物，革命的政治内容与艺术形式得到了较好的统一。他们在用器乐表现工人阶级的思想和生活方面，也突破了旧框框的束缚，作了创造性的有益尝试。民乐合奏《赛刀会》，用急骤敲击的扬琴和变化多端的古筝代表竞赛的“双方”，当小乐队的其他乐器突然声静，所有演奏者都侧身倾听扬琴与古筝独奏时，乐曲再现了“比学赶帮超，车间红旗飘，毛泽东思想放光芒，为了革命赛宝刀”的动人情景，给观众留下了难忘的印象。《师徒一对红》，是用音色不同的曲笛和梆笛象征“一对师徒”。它通过热情豪迈的曲调，采取轮奏、合奏、独奏和对奏等形式，加上其他乐器的伴奏，表达了师徒之间互帮互学、共同前进的思想内容。这些青年师生在深入工农兵生活和实际斗争中，学到了许多在课堂里根本学不到的东西，创作了这些节目，赋予器乐以新的生命，同时也提高了演奏技巧。
    谁对文艺作品有批准权？只有广大工农兵群众。只有打破少数资产阶级“专家”、“权威”对文艺批评的垄断，才能促进社会主义文艺的发展。反映工农业生产建设，表现工农兵生活和斗争的作品，过去是被“专家”、“权威”们认为“枯燥”和“粗野”的。上海音乐学院的青年师生在党的领导下，受到实际斗争的教育，没有被这些谬论所吓倒。他们坚持政治标准第一，艺术标准第二的准则，认识到任何艺术作品，只要能为工农兵服务而又为工农兵所喜闻乐见，就是好的或者基本上好的。他们根据斗争的需要创作作品，又把这些作品拿到群众中去排练，再根据群众的意见进行修改，直到被工农兵群众批准为止。这次专场演出的一些节目，正是由于经历了这样的过程，因而受到了广大工农兵群众的欢迎，并且给那些资产阶级“专家”“权威”的种种谬论以尖锐有力的批驳！
    参加实际斗争，促进人的思想革命化
    深入生活，参加实际斗争，最重要的是促进人的思想革命化。这是培养无产阶级文艺新军的头等重要的问题，也是无产阶级同资产阶级争夺青年一代的斗争焦点。参加这次音乐小队专场演出的青年当中，有的过去曾经出国表演，有的曾经在乐器演奏竞赛中名列前茅。一些资产阶级“专家”、“权威”曾经捧他们的场，从各方面给他们灌输资产阶级思想和资产阶级的艺术观点，千方百计地企图把他们培养成为资产阶级的接班人。在资产阶级思想的侵蚀下，有的青年教师和学生，一度埋头业务，不问政治，单纯追求技巧，厌恶劳动，一心一意想成名成家。上海音乐学院的党组织按照党和毛主席的教导，没有放松这一场严肃的阶级斗争。这些青年在党组织的教育和帮助下，从资产阶级个人主义的迷梦中渐渐清醒过来，到火热的斗争当中去锻炼和改造自己。
    很受观众欢迎的民乐重奏《老贫农话家史》的作曲者之一，是一个不过二十岁的女青年。她在资产阶级思想的侵蚀下，曾经去诵读唐诗，月下拉琴，表现《病中吟》《空山鸟语》之类作品的颓废、陈腐的情调，结果思想越来越空虚。党团组织及时把她从这条危险的路上拉了回来。她带着问题学习毛主席著作，到实际斗争中学习劳动人民的优秀品质，逐步认识到资产阶级个人主义的丑恶，感到改造自己的思想感情的重要。现在，这个年轻人开始沿着正确的道路健康地成长起来。她和同伴怀着革命激情创作了这支乐曲，在演出时倾注了自己的革命激情，用鲜明和富有对比性的音调，表现出老贫农教育年青的一代不忘阶级仇、坚决把革命进行到底的革命意志和阶级感情。
    乌兰牧骑式音乐小队专场演出在“上海之春”音乐会上出现，这还是第一次。广大观众纷纷在“意见表”上留下热情的赞语，肯定他们的正确方向，鼓励和支持他们沿着党和毛主席的文艺方向，沿着革命化的道路继续前进。参加这次演出的音乐小队代表全校青年师生表示：一定要更高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的伟大红旗，坚持深入生活，参加劳动，向工农兵学习，为工农兵服务，积极参加社会主义文化大革命，更加努力地把自己锻炼改造成为无产阶级的革命文艺事业的接班人。
