    U.S. Troops in Vietnam Killed by Errant U.S. Bombing

    (Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 18th) News from Saigon: U.S. planes, indiscriminately dropping bombs, have reaped a bitter harvest, killing and wounding sixty U.S. soldiers.

    According to Western news agencies, the U.S. military spokesman in Vietnam admitted on the 18th that on May 12, "some U.S. jets accidentally bombed a U.S. infantry unit engaged in combat," killing and wounding sixty U.S. troops.

    On that day, these U.S. troops were conducting a "sweep" sixty-odd kilometers northwest of Saigon and called in a group of U.S. F-100 jets, attempting to bomb a Liberation Armed Forces unit. However, because they "messed up" the target marking smoke, the "bombs fell on the head of a U.S. battalion."

    侵越美军飞机乱丢炸弹炸死美国兵
    新华社十八日讯　西贡消息：美国飞机乱投炸弹自食恶果，炸死、炸伤了六十名美国兵。
    据西方通讯社报道，侵越美军发言人十八日承认，五月十二日“一些美国喷气式飞机意外地轰炸了一支正在作战的美国步兵”，炸死、炸伤美军六十名。
    这批美军当天在西贡西北六十多公里的地方进行“扫荡”，召来了一批美国F—100喷气式飞机企图轰炸一支解放武装力量，但是由于把标志目标的烟“弄错了”，结果“炸弹落在一营美军的头上”。
