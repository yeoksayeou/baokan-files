    Since the *People's Daily* published an article criticizing the film *Besieged City* on April 11, 1966, and the *Liberation Army Daily* published an article criticizing the film *Catching Strong Laborers* on April 26, the *Guangming Daily*, *Worker's Daily*, *Ta Kung Pao*, *China Youth Daily*, as well as the *Liberation Daily*, *Wenhui Daily*, *Hebei Daily*, *Xinhua Daily*, *Jilin Daily*, *Sichuan Daily*, and other central and local newspapers, have successively published articles conducting serious and sharp criticisms of these two bad films that are opposed to Mao Zedong Thought. This criticism is unfolding under the current situation on the academic and literary fronts of a heroic offensive against bourgeois ideology and is a continuation and development of the criticism of bad films such as *North Country Scenery*, *Early Spring February*, *The Lin Family Shop*, and *Sleepless City*.

    *Guangming Daily*, *Sichuan Daily*, *Henan Daily*, and other newspapers, while publishing critical articles, added editor's notes. These notes correctly pointed out that these two films "are products of a counter-Party and anti-socialist black line in literary and art circles after liberation that is opposed to Mao Zedong Thought." Some articles also discussed the relationship between these two films and this black line, and some specifically pointed out their connection with the so-called literature and art of the 1930s. Two articles published separately in *Guangming Daily* and *Sichuan Daily* pointed out that *Besieged City*, *Catching Strong Laborers*, and *The Lin Family Shop* are birds of a feather. *The Lin Family Shop* sympathizes with the bourgeoisie; *Besieged City* glorifies senior Kuomintang reactionaries; and the landlord class in *Catching Strong Laborers* is depicted as "the insulted and the injured." From this comparison, the influence of the so-called literature and art of the 1930s on these two films can be clearly seen.

    In the criticism of the films *Besieged City* and *Catching Strong Laborers*, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers actively joined this battle. *People's Daily*, *Tianjin Daily*, *Henan Daily*, and others opened special columns to publish articles by worker-peasant-soldier readers. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers expressed great indignation at the counter-Party and anti-socialist black line that has existed on the cultural front for more than a decade since the founding of the country. With strong class feelings and a high sense of political responsibility, they used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and applied the method of class analysis to conduct sharp and powerful criticisms of these two films. The era in which the worker-peasant-soldier masses directly grasp the weapon of literary criticism has begun. This is a major event of epoch-making significance. Many revolutionary intellectuals have also joined this battle alongside the worker-peasant-soldier masses.

    The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers unanimously believe that *Besieged City* and *Catching Strong Laborers* are two major poisonous weeds that promote revisionism.

    What position to take? Who to praise? Who to oppose? This is a fundamental question. The films *Besieged City* and *Catching Strong Laborers* completely deviate from Mao Zedong Thought on this fundamental question. Many articles pointed out that these two films do not allow revolutionary workers, peasants, and soldiers to play the main roles on the stage and screen, but instead put the reactionary classes as the main characters, letting them dominate our stage and screen. Gao Ju's article published in the *Liberation Army Daily*—"The Film *Besieged City* is a Poisonous Weed Spreading Revisionist Ideas"—pointed out: When describing the enemy, *Besieged City* tried its best to avoid their anti-communist and anti-people essence, concentrating on describing and rendering their "glorious history" and "excellent qualities," and writing the Kuomintang miscellaneous army, which is essentially also a pillar of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime, as an "oppressed class," and shaping the Chiang bandit officers, whose hands are stained with the blood of the people, into perfect "heroes." On the contrary, they did their utmost to distort our personnel. In front of the enemy, they were not confident, righteous, and stern, but rather humble, flattering, replacing revolutionary principles with private feelings, replacing serious struggle with begging, and flattering the enemy with praise. Many articles pointed out that, not coincidentally, the sympathy of the directors of the film *Catching Strong Laborers* is also focused on the landlord class. From this film, neither the economic exploitation nor the political oppression suffered by the peasants due to the conscription of laborers can be seen, nor can the resistance and struggle carried out by the peasants be seen. The film's director describes with relish the contradictions between the landlord Li Laoshan and the Kuomintang puppet Baozhang. It seems that the Kuomintang's conscription of laborers, those who suffer are not the broad masses of working people, but the reactionary landlord class. This film uses a series of jokes as cover, but in reality, it speaks and complains for the landlord class. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers sharply refuted the lies of the film's director with their own bloodstained personal experiences. Jiang Bingrong, a worker engineer from Chengdu, published an article in the *Worker's Daily* entitled "The Landlord Class is the Murderer of Catching Strong Laborers," said: Before liberation, in order to earn a living, I traveled to more than 20 large and small counties. What I saw and heard was that the landlord class and the reactionary regime colluded with each other to conscript peasants as laborers. There was no conscription of landlords' young masters. In the old society, the landlord class and the Kuomintang reactionaries sang the same tune. They were inseparable from each other.

    At a time when fierce struggles are taking place between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist road and the capitalist road, whether to stand on the proletarian position, highlight class and class struggle, or to stand on the bourgeois position, advocate human nature, and promote class reconciliation, is a touchstone for testing Marxism and revisionism. The films *Besieged City* and *Catching Strong Laborers* contradicted Mao Zedong Thought on this very issue of principle. Yao Kui, a soldier, published an article in the *Xinhua Daily* entitled "Class Struggle Cannot Be Replaced by 'Human Nature'": Jiang Minister in *Besieged City*, as the leader of our army's political work, did not proceed from a firm proletarian position in front of the enemy and sternly point out the enemy's inevitable failure, but instead attempted to "enlighten" the enemy's "conscience" with the so-called "human relations" that everyone has in common. For the enemy's regimental commander Zheng Hanchen, Jiang Minister used a "broad" "mind" to persuade him to "lay down his butcher knife"; for the enemy's division commander Zhao Chongwu, Jiang Minister used to reminisce about the friendship of the year and begged him to "change his mind." This is a blatant promotion of bourgeois and revisionist theories of human nature and class reconciliation. Many articles pointed out that *Catching Strong Laborers* also vigorously advocated the theory of class reconciliation. The landlord Li Laoshan in the film does not have the nature of oppressing peasants and exploiting peasants, but is also subjected to the oppression of the Kuomintang. Here, there is no essential difference between the opposing classes, but they have the same experiences and the same fate. The landlord and the peasant are "one in two."

    Currently, many newspapers are continuing to criticize these two bad films.

### 工农兵群众口诛笔伐围攻坏影片《兵临城下》《抓壮丁》

专栏：文艺战报

    工农兵群众口诛笔伐围攻坏影片《兵临城下》《抓壮丁》
    自一九六六年四月十一日《人民日报》发表批判影片《兵临城下》的文章，四月二十六日《解放军报》发表批判影片《抓壮丁》的文章以来，《光明日报》、《工人日报》、《大公报》、《中国青年报》以及《解放日报》、《文汇报》、《河北日报》、《新华日报》、《吉林日报》、《四川日报》等中央和地方报纸，相继发表文章，对这两部与毛泽东思想相对立的坏影片进行了严肃尖锐的批判。这次批判，是在当前学术、文艺战线上向着资产阶级思想英勇进攻的形势下展开的，是对《北国江南》、《早春二月》、《林家铺子》、《不夜城》等坏影片批判的继续和发展。
    《光明日报》、《四川日报》、《河南日报》等报，在发表批判文章的同时，都加了编者按。这些按语正确地指出：这两部影片“是解放后文艺界的一条与毛泽东思想相对立的反党反社会主义的黑线影响下的产物。”有些文章也谈到了这两部影片同这条黑线的关系，有的并特别点明了它们和所谓三十年代文艺的联系。分别发表在《光明日报》和《四川日报》上的两篇文章都指出：《兵临城下》、《抓壮丁》和《林家铺子》是一丘之貉。《林家铺子》同情资产阶级；《兵临城下》美化国民党反动派高级军官；而《抓壮丁》里的地主阶级又被描绘成“被侮辱与被损害”的人。从这种对比中，可以清楚地看到所谓三十年代文艺对这两部影片的影响。
    在批判影片《兵临城下》和《抓壮丁》中，广大工农兵群众积极投入了这场战斗。《人民日报》、《天津日报》、《河南日报》等分别开辟了专栏，刊登工农兵读者的文章。广大工农兵群众对建国十几年来文化战线上存在的一条与毛泽东思想相对立的反党反社会主义的黑线，表示了极大的愤慨。他们怀着强烈的阶级感情和高度的政治责任感，以毛泽东思想为武器，运用阶级分析的方法，对这两部影片进行了尖锐有力的批判。工农兵群众直接掌握文艺批评这个武器的时代已经开始了。这是具有划时代意义的大事。不少革命的知识分子，也同工农兵群众一道，积极参加了这场战斗。
    广大工农兵群众一致认为：《兵临城下》和《抓壮丁》是两部宣扬修正主义的大毒草。
    站在什么立场？歌颂谁？反对谁？这是一个根本的问题。影片《兵临城下》和《抓壮丁》恰恰在这个根本问题上，完全背离了毛泽东思想。许多文章指出，这两部影片不让革命的工农兵在舞台银幕上唱主角，而是把反动阶级当作主角，让他们霸占了我们的舞台银幕。发表在《解放军报》上的高炬同志的文章——《影片〈兵临城下〉是一棵宣扬修正主义思想的毒草》指出：《兵临城下》在描写敌人时，竭力避开他们反共反人民的本质，集中力量描写和渲染他们的“光荣历史”和“优秀品德”，把本质上同样是蒋介石反动政权支柱的国民党杂牌军，写成了“受压迫阶级”，把双手沾满人民鲜血的蒋匪军官，塑造成了完美的“英雄”。相反，对我方人员则竭尽了歪曲之能事。在敌人面前，他们不是理直气壮，义正词严，而是低声下气，媚态十足，以私情代替革命的原则，以乞求代替严肃的斗争，以吹捧来迎合敌人。许多文章指出，无独有偶，影片《抓壮丁》编导者的同情，也是倾注在地主阶级方面的。从这部影片里，既看不到农民们因抓壮丁而受到的经济剥削和政治压迫，更看不到农民们所进行的反抗和斗争。影片编导者津津有味地描写地主李老栓与国民党伪保长之间的矛盾。好象国民党抓壮丁，受苦受难的不是广大的劳动人民，倒是反动的地主阶级。这部影片用一连串的笑料打掩护，实际上是替地主阶级说话喊冤。广大工农兵群众以自己血泪斑斑的亲身经历，尖锐地驳斥了影片编导者的谎话。发表在《工人日报》上的成都工人工程师蒋炳荣的文章《地主阶级是抓壮丁的凶手》说：解放前为了挣碗饭吃，我走了二十多个大小县城，看到和听到的，都是地主阶级和反动政权狼狈为奸，抓农民的壮丁，根本没有抓壮丁抓到地主少爷头上的事情。在旧社会，地主阶级和国民党反动派是一个鼻孔出气，他们谁也离不开谁。
    在无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义道路和资本主义道路进行着激烈斗争的时候，是站在无产阶级立场上，突出阶级和阶级斗争，还是站在资产阶级立场上，鼓吹人性论，宣扬阶级调和，这是检验马克思主义与修正主义的试金石。影片《兵临城下》和《抓壮丁》恰恰在这个原则问题上，同毛泽东思想唱反调。发表在《新华日报》上的战士姚葵的文章《不能以“人性论”代替阶级斗争》指出：《兵临城下》中的姜部长，作为我军政治工作的领导者，他在敌人面前，不是从坚定的无产阶级立场出发，严正地指出敌人必然失败的命运，相反地，企图以所谓人人相通的“人情”来“启发”敌人的“良心”。对于敌军团长郑汉臣，姜部长是以“宽大”的“胸怀”，感化他“放下屠刀”；对于敌军师长赵崇武，姜部长是以畅叙当年的情谊，乞求他“回心转意”。这是明目张胆地宣扬资产阶级、修正主义的人性论和阶级调和论。不少文章指出，《抓壮丁》也大肆鼓吹了阶级调和论。影片中的地主李老栓没有压迫农民、剥削农民的本性，而是同样受着国民党的压迫，这里，对立的阶级没有本质的区别，而是有着同样的遭遇，同样的命运，地主与农民“合二而一”了。
    目前，许多报纸还在继续批判这两部坏影片。
