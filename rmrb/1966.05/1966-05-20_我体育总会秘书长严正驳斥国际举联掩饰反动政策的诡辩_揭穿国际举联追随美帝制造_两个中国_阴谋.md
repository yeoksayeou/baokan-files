    Xinhua News Agency, 19th -- Zhang Lianhua, Secretary-General of the All-China Sports Federation, in a reply letter today to Oscar State (British), Secretary-General of the International Weightlifting and Fitness Federation (IWF), sternly refuted his sophistry regarding the IWF's reactionary policies and exposed the IWF's conspiracy to create "Two Chinas."
    Last year, the IWF unreasonably sanctioned weightlifters from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Romania, Pakistan, Indonesia, and other countries who had competed with Chinese weightlifters, prohibiting them from participating in the World Weightlifting Championships for a period of one year. Chinese newspapers and periodicals exposed and condemned this shameless act of the IWF. On March 23 this year, IWF Secretary-General State wrote to Zhang Lianhua, Secretary-General of the All-China Sports Federation, attempting to quibble about this matter and to entice China to return to the IWF, creating a "Two Chinas" situation.
    Zhang Lianhua pointed out in the reply letter that the IWF, following the anti-China reactionary policies of U.S. imperialism and under the control of its American chairman, Johnson, has barbarously sanctioned countries that have engaged in weightlifting competitions with the People's Republic of China. This is a serious infringement upon the sovereignty of these countries and a blatant provocation against the sports circles of the People's Republic of China. We are willing to solemnly warn the gentlemen who manipulate the IWF: Today is an era of great awakening for the people of the world, not an era in which imperialism can do whatever it pleases.
    Zhang Lianhua said in the reply letter that sports exchanges between the people of various countries have always been a matter for the people of those countries themselves and should not be interfered with by anyone. The fact that athletes from various countries engage in sports competitions with Chinese athletes reflects the desire of the people of those countries to engage in friendly exchanges with the Chinese people. The people and athletes of various countries will never be bound by your illegal "regulations" of this kind or that. The various restrictions you have set will inevitably be completely broken through. This is an irresistible historical trend.
    In the reply letter, Zhang Lianhua sternly refuted State's delusion that the Chinese Weightlifting Association would rejoin the IWF. He said that the Chinese people and athletes will never abandon their position of firmly opposing imperialism's monopoly of international sports affairs and supporting the people of all countries in their struggle to safeguard their rights of independence and autonomy, and will never allow any "Two Chinas" situation to appear in international sports activities. We have no interest whatsoever in your so-called "World Championships." The Chinese people and weightlifters have friends all over the world and have a broad world in which to exchange techniques, learn from each other, and improve together with friends from various countries. I advise you not to stretch your hands out too far, otherwise what awaits you will be even greater failure.

    我体育总会秘书长严正驳斥国际举联掩饰反动政策的诡辩
    揭穿国际举联追随美帝制造“两个中国”阴谋
    新华社十九日讯　中华全国体育总会秘书长张联华今天在写给国际举重与健身联合会秘书长奥斯卡·斯太特（英国）的复信中，严正驳斥了他对国际举联反动政策的诡辩，并且揭穿了国际举联制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    去年，国际举联曾经无理制裁同我国举重运动员进行过比赛的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、罗马尼亚、巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚等国的举重运动员，禁止他们参加世界举重锦标赛，为期一年。我国报刊曾经就国际举联这一无耻行径加以揭露和谴责。今年三月二十三日，国际举联秘书长斯太特写信给中华全国体育总会秘书长张联华，对此事进行狡辩，并且企图引诱我国返回国际举联，制造“两个中国”的局面。
    张联华在复信中指出，国际举联追随美帝国主义敌视中国的反动政策，在其美籍主席约翰逊的把持下，横蛮地制裁同中华人民共和国进行举重比赛的国家。这是对这些国家的主权的严重侵犯，也是对中华人民共和国体育界的露骨挑衅。我们愿意正告操纵着国际举联的先生们：今天是世界人民大觉醒的时代，不是帝国主义可以为所欲为的时代了。
    张联华在复信中说，各国人民之间的体育交往，从来就是各国人民自己的事，不容任何人干涉。各国运动员和中国运动员进行体育比赛，反映了各国人民要求和中国人民进行友好往来的愿望。各国人民和运动员决不会被你们这样或那样的非法“规定”缚住手脚。你们设置的种种限制，必将被彻底冲破。这是不可抗拒的历史潮流。
    张联华在复信中，对斯太特妄想我国举重协会再次加入国际举联一事严加驳斥。他说，中国人民和运动员决不放弃坚决反对帝国主义垄断国际体育事务、支持各国人民为维护独立自主权利而斗争的立场，决不容许国际体育活动中出现任何“两个中国”的局面。对于你们的所谓“世界锦标赛”，我们毫无兴趣。中国人民和举重运动员的朋友遍天下，有着同各国朋友交流技术、相互学习、共同提高的广阔天地。我劝你们的手不要伸得太长了，否则等待你们的将是更大的失败。
