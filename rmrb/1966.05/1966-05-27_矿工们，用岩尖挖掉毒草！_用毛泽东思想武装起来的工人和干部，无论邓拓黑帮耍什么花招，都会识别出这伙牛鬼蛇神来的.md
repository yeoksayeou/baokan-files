    Miners, Use Rock Tips to Dig Out Poisonous Weeds!
    Workers and Cadres Armed with Mao Zedong Thought Will Recognize These Demons and Monsters No Matter What Tricks the Deng Tuo Gang Plays.
    National People's Congress Representative, Worker Engineer Guo Qingsi
    Deng Tuo, the owner of the "Three-Family Village" black shop, released many poisonous arrows at the Party and the people in "Yanshan Night Talks" and "Three-Family Village Notes." He turned a blind eye to the facts, sat in his house, rummaged through old and broken things, resurrected corpses, and attacked our great Party with veiled accusations of being "self-righteous and looking down on the masses." These vicious anti-Party and anti-socialist words aroused anger in my heart. If he were nearby, I would definitely drag him to our mine and let him see the facts.
    Deng Tuo's claim that the Party is "self-righteous and looks down on the masses" is a complete fabrication. At all times, the Party is most concerned about, cares for, and respects us workers. Take me, for example. In the old society, I was a person trampled underfoot, begging for food, doing hard labor, and living a life worse than that of cattle and horses for years. At that time, we didn't even have the right to speak, and who respected us workers? After liberation, the working class gained power and became masters of the country. I was illiterate, and the Party sent me to study culture. I lacked technical knowledge, and the Party created good conditions for me to learn technical knowledge. When I achieved some success in production and work, the Party gave me honorary titles such as labor model, advanced producer, and "Five-Good" worker. Now, I have not only been promoted from an ordinary worker to an engineer, but since 1954, I have been elected as a representative to the National People's Congress, and I have sat with our beloved Chairman Mao and other Party and state leaders in Beijing many times to discuss important national and world affairs together. Look at our mine: Under the cultivation and education of the Party, the workers have also grown rapidly. Not to mention the cadres transferred to support fraternal units, most of the current cadres at all levels in the mine have been promoted from workers. Major events in the mine are discussed and decided at the workers' representative congress. We workers have full rights to express our opinions and be masters of our own affairs. But Deng Tuo and his ilk insist that our Party "looks down on the masses." This is telling lies with open eyes.
    Why do Deng Tuo and his ilk tell lies with open eyes? A discerning person can see clearly that they want to sow discord between us working masses and the Party's flesh-and-blood relationship, attempting to implement capitalist restoration in our country. I want to warn Deng Tuo: Your efforts are in vain! We are workers and cadres armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and we can recognize you demons and monsters. No matter what tricks you play, you cannot deceive us workers. Chairman Mao taught us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we will support; whatever the enemy supports, we will oppose." Now, Deng Tuo and his gang are doing their utmost to oppose our Party, which proves the brilliance, greatness, and correctness of our Party. We must unite closely around the Party, use our rock tips and axes to thoroughly dig out all anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds, and never stop fighting until complete victory.

    矿工们，用岩尖挖掉毒草！
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人和干部，无论邓拓黑帮耍什么花招，都会识别出这伙牛鬼蛇神来的
    全国人民代表大会代表工人工程师  郭清泗
    邓拓，这个“三家村”黑店的掌柜，在《燕山夜话》和《三家村札记》里，向党和人民放出了许许多多的毒箭。他睁眼不看事实，坐在房子里，翻腾旧破烂，借尸还魂，含沙射影地攻击我们伟大的党“自作聪明，看不起群众”。这些恶毒的反党反社会主义的话，激起了我心头的怒火，如果他在近处，我一定要揪他到我们矿上来，叫他看看事实。
    邓拓说什么党“自作聪明，看不起群众”，完全是造谣污蔑。不论什么时候，党都是最关心、最爱护、最看得起我们工人群众的。就拿我来说，在旧社会，我是个被人踩在脚底下的人，讨饭，做苦工，成年累月过着牛马不如的生活。那时，我们连说话的权利都没有，有谁看得起我们工人。解放后，工人阶级坐了江山，做了国家主人，我不识字，党就派我去学文化。我缺乏技术知识，党给我创造学技术知识的良好条件。当我在生产、工作上取得一些成绩时，党又给了我劳动模范、先进生产者、“五好”职工等光荣称号，现在，我不仅由一个普通的工人提升为工程师，而且从一九五四年起，就当选为全国人民代表大会代表，多次上北京同我们敬爱的毛主席以及党和国家的其他领导人坐在一起，共同讨论国家的大事，世界的大事。再看看我们矿上吧：职工们在党的培养教育下，也一个个迅速成长起来，除调出支援兄弟单位的干部不说，现有在矿的各级干部，大半是从工人中提拔起来的。矿上的大事都要在职工代表大会上讨论决定，我们工人有充分发表意见、当家作主的权利。可是邓拓之流硬说我们党“看不起群众”，这是睁着眼睛说瞎话。
    邓拓之流为什么要睁着眼睛说瞎话？明眼人一看就清楚，是要挑拨我们劳动群众和党的血肉关系，企图在我们国家实行资本主义复辟。我要警告邓拓：你是枉费心机！我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人、干部，我们能识别你们这伙牛鬼蛇神，不管你们耍什么花招，也欺骗不了我们工人群众。毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”现在邓拓等一伙，极力反对我们的党，这正说明我们党的英明、伟大、正确，我们一定要紧密地团结在党的周围，用我们的岩尖、斧子，彻底挖掉一切反党反社会主义的毒草，不获全胜，决不收兵。
