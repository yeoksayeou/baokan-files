    The principle of "from the masses, to the masses" is our Party's fundamental line. Our Party has consistently implemented this line and achieved one victory after another. The Deng Tuo gang wants us to accept the opinions of demons and monsters, listen to the black talk of the "Three-Family Village," and adopt the revisionist line; this will never happen.

    Chairman Mao said: "The struggle to decide whether socialism or capitalism will win in the ideological sphere in our country still requires a considerable amount of time." The current socialist cultural revolution is a life-or-death class struggle between us and the bourgeoisie. Now, under the heroic counterattack of our workers, peasants, and soldiers, the ugly faces of the Deng Tuo clique have been greatly exposed, and the "authority" of the bourgeoisie is about to collapse. However, the struggle is still intense, and we are determined to pursue the victory and further inflict a devastating blow on the enemy, resolutely smash the "Three-Family Village" black shop, and thoroughly dig up the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line.

    This gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist black elements, led by Deng Tuo, used *Yanshan Night Talks* and *Three-Family Village Notes* to fire black guns and shoot poisoned arrows. In his article "Is Ingenuity Reliable?", Deng Tuo purposefully said that our Party is "self-righteous, looks down on the masses," and "does not accept good opinions from the masses below." This is complete nonsense, a malicious slander. Everyone knows very well that the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses" is the fundamental line of our Party. All the work of the Party starts from the fundamental interests of the masses, and the Party's policies reflect the demands of the broad masses of the people. Chairman Mao has always emphasized investigation and research, and has told us to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, consult with the masses on issues, and listen to the opinions of the masses.

    In the old society where people ate people, I worked as a coolie for many years at the Fushun No. 1 Petroleum Factory. At that time, we workers did the work of oxen and horses, ate the food of pigs and dogs, and suffered all kinds of class oppression. The capitalists treated the workers as mere talking livestock. Workers only had the right to be beaten and starve, and had no right to speak out. This is how the bourgeoisie treated us, the people. The landlord class and the feudal rulers of past dynasties were birds of a feather with the bourgeoisie; they trusted the masses the least and looked down on the masses the most.

    The Chinese Communist Party led the people of the whole country to overthrow the three great mountains weighing down on them, liberated us from the oppression and exploitation of the landlords and capitalists, and made us masters of the country. Like many emancipated workers, I was gradually cultivated and promoted by the Party from an ordinary coolie to a leader of the enterprise. In 1964, I was also elected as a representative to the National People's Congress. An ordinary coolie in the old society could actually sit with the Party and state leaders in the new society and jointly discuss national affairs. Can this be said to mean that the Party looks down on the masses? Facts prove that the Party trusts the masses the most and respects the masses the most.

    Take our Lanzhou Refinery as another example. Under the glorious light of Mao Zedong Thought and under the guidance of the General Line, in recent years, this petroleum processing enterprise, which could only produce a small number of products in the past, has been transformed into an advanced, Chinese-style large-scale oil refining base and built into a Daqing-style enterprise. Now, more than a hundred kinds of petroleum products can be produced in batches, effectively smashing the Khrushchev modern revisionist group's blockade of our country's petroleum products. The achievement of these results is precisely because, under the leadership of the Party, we have relied on the masses in class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experiments. For example, the state urgently needed a special lubricant. We originally did not know how to produce it, with neither technical data nor production experience. Facing these difficulties, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings on going to the masses and learning from the masses, deeply mobilized the masses, convened "Zhuge Liang Meetings," everyone put forward measures, everyone thought of solutions, and after hundreds of discussions and repeated experiments, we finally successfully trial-produced it, supporting industrial and agricultural production and national defense construction. Is this not precisely the victory of "widely seeking counsel and following the opinions of the majority"?

    In enterprise management, we have also fundamentally changed the capitalist and revisionist methods, relying on the workers to manage the socialist enterprise themselves. Most of the various mechanical power equipment in our factory are machines with high temperature, high pressure, and high speed. It is not enough to rely on a few leading cadres and technicians to manage this equipment well. We have carried out mass "Five-Good" equipment activities on a large scale. The broad masses of workers cherish the equipment like soldiers cherish their weapons. Some workers, finding water in the lubricating oil, fearing damage to the equipment, even used their mouths to suck the water out of the oil. It is precisely because of the masses' high sense of ownership and revolutionary consciousness that the perfect equipment rate of the entire factory is as high as 99.2 percent, of which "Five-Good" equipment accounts for 55.4 percent, guaranteeing the smooth progress of production. We also guarantee the implementation of the Party's mass line through the system of "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations," ensuring that we consult with the masses on issues and pay attention to listening to the opinions of the masses.

    Such facts are endless. The Deng Tuo gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements wants our Party to "accept good opinions from the masses below." What is their intention? The "masses" in Deng Tuo's pen refer to their gang of bourgeois "authorities" and "experts," and to landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Deng Tuo wants us to accept the "opinions" of this small group of demons and monsters; he wants us to listen to the black talk of the "Three-Family Village" and adopt the revisionist line, clearing the way for capitalist restoration, thereby dragging us back to the dark world of exploitation and oppression. The class enemy's sinister plot will never succeed. We must stand at the forefront of the Cultural Revolution, tightly grasp the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, aim at the enemy and strike them hard, completely defeat them, so that they can no longer stir up trouble.

### 党最相信群众　群众最相信党

    党最相信群众　群众最相信党
    从群众中来，到群众中去，是我们党的根本路线。我们党一向执行这条路线，取得了一个又一个的胜利。邓拓黑帮要我们接受牛鬼蛇神的意见，听取“三家村”的黑话，采纳修正主义路线，这是永远办不到的。
    全国人民代表大会代表石油工业部五好标兵、兰州炼油厂副厂长
    毛鹏飞
    毛主席说：“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决”。当前的社会主义文化大革命，就是我们同资产阶级的一场你死我活的阶级斗争。现在，在我们工农兵的英勇反击下，邓拓一伙的丑恶嘴脸已经大暴露，资产阶级的“权威”快要完蛋了。但是，斗争还很激烈，我们决心乘胜追击，进一步给敌人以毁灭性的打击，坚决捣毁“三家村”黑店，彻底挖掉反党反社会主义的黑线。
    邓拓这伙反党反社会主义黑帮，通过《燕山夜话》和《三家村札记》，打黑枪，射毒箭。邓拓在《智谋是可靠的吗？》一文中，别有用心地说我们党“自作聪明，看不起群众”，“不接受下面群众的好意见”。这完全是瞎说，完全是恶意的诬蔑。大家都很清楚，“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线，是我们党的根本路线。党的一切工作都是从群众的根本利益出发的，党的方针政策反映了广大人民的要求。毛主席从来就强调调查研究，要我们相信群众，依靠群众，有事同群众商量，倾听群众意见。
    在人吃人的旧社会，我在抚顺石油一厂当了多年小工。那时候，我们工人干的牛马活，吃的猪狗食，受尽了种种阶级压迫。资本家把工人当作只是会说话的牲口，工人只有挨打挨饿的份儿，根本没有出面讲话的权利。资产阶级就是这样对待我们人民群众的。地主阶级和历代的封建统治者，和资产阶级是一丘之貉，他们最不相信群众，最看不起群众。
    中国共产党领导全国人民推翻了压在头上的三座大山，把我们从地主、资本家的压迫、剥削下解放出来，使我们翻身作了国家的主人。我象许多翻身工人一样，被党从一名普通的小工，逐步培养、提拔成为企业的领导人。一九六四年，我还被选为全国人民代表大会代表。旧社会的一名普通小工，在新社会居然跟党和国家领导人坐在一起，共同讨论国家大事，这能说党看不起群众吗？事实证明，党最相信群众，最看得起群众。
    再拿我们兰州炼油厂来说，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在总路线的指引下，这几年把过去只能生产少量品种的石油加工企业，改造成为一个具有先进技术的、中国式的大型炼油基地，建设成为一个大庆式企业。现在可以成批生产一百多种石油产品，有力地粉碎了赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义集团对我国石油产品的封锁。这些成绩的取得，正是由于我们在党的领导下，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验中依靠群众的结果。举个例子，国家急需一种特种润滑油，我们原先不会生产，既没有技术资料，又没有生产经验。面对着这些困难，我们按照毛主席关于到群众中去，向群众学习的教导，深入发动群众，召开“诸葛亮会”，人人提措施，个个想办法，经过了上百次的讨论和反复的试验，终于试制成功了，支援了工农业生产和国防建设。这难道不正是“广谋从众”的胜利吗？
    在企业管理上，我们也从根本上改变了资本主义、修正主义的一套，依靠工人群众自己管好社会主义企业。我们厂的各种机械动力设备，大部分是温度高、压力大、转速快的机器，要把这些设备管好，单靠几个领导干部和技术人员是不行的。我们大搞了群众性的“五好”设备活动，广大职工象战士爱护武器一样地爱护设备。有的工人，发现润滑油中有水，恐怕损坏设备，硬是用嘴把水从油里吸出来。就是靠群众的这种高度的主人翁精神和革命自觉性，全厂的设备完好率高达百分之九十九点二，其中“五好”设备达百分之五十五点四，保证了生产的顺利进行。我们还从“两参一改三结合”的制度上，来保证党的群众路线的贯彻，做到有事同群众商量，注意听取群众意见。
    这样的事实是说不完的。邓拓一伙反党反社会主义分子，要我们党“接受下面群众的好意见”，这是什么用意？邓拓笔下的“群众”，指的是他们一伙资产阶级“权威”，“专家”，指的是地富反坏右分子。邓拓就是要我们接受这一小撮牛鬼蛇神的“意见”，就是妄想要我们听取“三家村”的黑话，采纳修正主义路线，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道，从而把我们拖回受剥削受压迫的黑暗世界。阶级敌人这一险恶的阴谋，是永远不能得逞的。我们一定要站在文化大革命的最前列，紧握毛泽东思想的锐利武器，瞄准敌人狠狠地打，彻底打垮他们，使他们再也不能兴妖作怪。
