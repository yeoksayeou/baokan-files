    Who Was Fooled by "Zhou Yu Beats Huang Gai"?
    Shi JingShan Iron and Steel Plant Luo Jinxin, Yu Guizhi
    The *Qianxian* (Frontline) and *Beijing Ribao* (Beijing Daily) editorial departments have put on quite a show. Under the general heading of "Criticism of 'Three-Family Village' and *Yanshan Yehu*," they have used three full pages, acting as if they were really going to "carry out a serious criticism" of Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha, this small handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist elements. In reality, this is a smokescreen, a fake criticism to genuinely protect and shield this small handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist elements!
    *Qianxian*, *Beijing Ribao*, and *Beijing Wanbao* (Beijing Evening News) are our Party's and the capital's propaganda fronts. However, in recent years, they have become Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha's "Three-Family Village," turning into their "stronghold" for opposing the Party and socialism. They have used these "strongholds" to release a large amount of poisonous weeds, creating a murky atmosphere. The editorial departments have suppressed articles from workers, peasants, and soldiers criticizing these poisonous weeds, refusing to publish them. What are your intentions?
    Today, when the people of the whole country are involved in the vigorous Great Cultural Revolution movement, your *Qianxian* and *Beijing Ribao* editorial departments, seeing that the situation is not good, have suddenly become "active," pretending to conduct "criticism" and make "self-criticisms." But what are you "criticizing" and "self-criticizing"?
    Just by flipping through *Yanshan Yehu*, one will know that Deng Tuo, under the guise of discussing history, imparting knowledge, telling stories, and making jokes, viciously attacked our great Party, opposed the general line of socialist construction and the Great Leap Forward, slandered us as "boasting" and "talking big," and "bumping his head and bleeding" in the face of facts, saying that our construction undertaking was "the possessions of one egg" and would ultimately "end." He also encouraged right-leaning opportunists who had been removed from office to make a comeback and arrogantly shouted for our Party to quickly step down and "rest"... For such a reactionary commander-in-chief who has a deep-seated hatred for the Party and socialism, you repeatedly call him "comrade," lightly saying that he "published some poisonous weeds," using his minor articles to fill the pages, and trying your best to cover up the anti-Party and anti-socialist arguments, as if he unintentionally made a mistake, just a small pawn who can be leniently treated. What are your intentions?
    You say you have lost your position, this is a lie.
    In the past, you opened up an anti-Party and anti-socialist front for them, and today you want to build a shelter for them. This is your position. Wanting to cover up Deng Tuo, this anti-Party and anti-socialist commander-in-chief, and let him slip through, is absolutely impossible! The steelworkers of the capital resolutely disagree! We must stand at the forefront of the Great Cultural Revolution and not allow anyone to undermine the foundation!

    “周瑜打黄盖”骗得了谁？
    石景山钢铁厂　罗锦新　于桂芝
    《前线》和《北京日报》编辑部摆起了好大的架势，在《关于“三家村”和〈燕山夜话〉的批判》的总栏题下，花了三个版的篇幅，好象真要对邓拓、吴晗和廖沫沙这一小撮反党反社会主义分子“开展严肃的批判”。实际上这是烟幕弹，是假批判、真包庇，是为这一小撮反党反社会主义分子打掩护！
    《前线》、《北京日报》和《北京晚报》，是我们党和首都人民的宣传阵地，可是这些年来，却成了邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙的“三家村”，变成他们反党反社会主义的“据点”。他们利用这些“据点”，放出了大量的毒草，搞得乌烟瘴气。对于工农兵批判这些毒草的稿件，编辑部却扣压起来，不予发表。你们的居心何在？
    今天，当全国人民都卷入了声势浩大的文化大革命运动的时候，你们《前线》和《北京日报》编辑部看形势不妙，便突然“积极”起来，装模作样要搞“批判”、作“检讨”，但是你们“批判”和“检讨”的又是些什么呢？
    只要翻翻《燕山夜话》就会知道，邓拓以谈历史、传知识、讲故事、说笑话作幌子，恶毒地攻击我们伟大的党，反对社会主义建设总路线和大跃进，诬蔑我们是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”，在事实面前“碰得头破血流”，说什么我们的建设事业是“一个鸡蛋的家当”，终究要“完蛋”。他还鼓励被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子东山再起，并狂妄地叫喊要我们党赶快下台“休息”……。对于这样一个对党和社会主义有刻骨仇恨的反动主帅，你们却口口声声称他为“同志”，轻描淡写地只说他“发表了一些毒草”，拿他次要的文章来充斥版面，对反党反社会主义的论点极力掩盖起来，好象他无意中犯了错误，只不过是一个小卒，可以从宽处理。你们的居心又何在？
    你们说丧失了立场，这是假话。
    你们过去为他们开辟反党反社会主义阵地，今天又想为他们建造掩蔽部，这就是你们的立场。想掩护邓拓这员反党反社会主义的主帅蒙混过关，这是万万办不到的！首都的钢铁工人坚决不答应！我们一定要站在文化大革命的最前线，不许任何人挖墙脚！
