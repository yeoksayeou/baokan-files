    Actively Participate in the Socialist Cultural Revolution

    The *Liberation Army Daily* editorial "Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Actively Participate in the Socialist Cultural Revolution" is a very important article. The editorial uses Mao Zedong Thought, grasps some fundamental issues in current literary and artistic work, and extremely profoundly summarizes the experiences and lessons of sixteen years of socialist culture and art work. These experiences are of universal significance, not only guiding the literary and artistic work of the military, but also guiding the further development of the local Socialist Cultural Revolution movement. After reading this article, I received a great education.
    The editorial points out: "For more than a decade after the founding of the country, there has been a counter-Party and anti-socialist black line in literary and artistic circles that is opposed to Mao Zedong Thought." Like the rest of the country, the class struggle on the cultural front in our province is also very sharp and intense. Since liberation, there have been several reversals in staging revolutionary modern dramas, and the stage has long been dominated by emperors, kings, generals, ministers, scholars, and beauties; some bad plays such as *Xie Yaohuan* were also staged that were anti-Party and anti-socialist. The emergence of these phenomena is mainly because we lack the concept of class and class struggle, and have not resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction in our drama work. In the final analysis, it is because our own worldview has not been thoroughly transformed. In the past, our understanding of class struggle was very insufficient. Now we must have a full understanding of this issue. Taking drama work as an example, in terms of the situation in our province, the vast majority of literary and art cadres have a positive attitude towards staging revolutionary modern dramas, but there are also some literary and art cadres who do not. Some people treat staging revolutionary modern dramas as a "passing fad," reluctant to part with traditional operas; others ridicule revolutionary modern dramas as "plain boiled water"; and some even use the excuse that "the masses do not welcome them" or "they don't attract audiences" to oppose staging revolutionary modern dramas. These situations show that it will take a long and repeated struggle to consolidate the position of revolutionary modern dramas on the stage. Therefore, we must give prominence to politics, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the Cultural Revolution, take class struggle as the key link, and resolutely smash the counter-Party and anti-socialist black line that is opposed to Mao Zedong Thought.
    As the editorial points out: "In the past three years, the Socialist Cultural Revolution has seen a new situation." Under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, the cultural and artistic work in our province has implemented the spirit of the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in recent years and launched a struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, thus creating a new situation. This is prominently manifested in the revolutionization of drama work. Under the impetus and influence of the National Peking Opera Festival, the creation of revolutionary modern dramas in our province has developed and improved to a certain extent in both quantity and quality. Modern dramas have occupied the stage, and the artistic images of advanced figures among workers, peasants, and soldiers have replaced the images of emperors, kings, generals, ministers, scholars, and beauties. Since the beginning of this year, more than 7,000 of the province's 8,000-plus drama workers have participated in the socialist education movement in urban and rural areas and have gone deep into rural areas, factories, mines, and troops to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, initially changing the past "three separations" situation of being detached from the masses, detached from reality, and detached from life. Another manifestation is the vigorous development of mass amateur cultural activities. At present, rural cultural centers have been established relatively universally in rural areas throughout the province, and mass amateur literary and artistic creation has also greatly developed, with the emergence of some excellent or relatively excellent works.
    However, it must also be seen that the cultural and artistic work in our province still lags behind the needs of the development of the situation, and the problem of implementing the Party's literary and artistic direction has not been thoroughly resolved. The fundamental reason is that we have not given prominence to politics and have not used Mao Zedong Thought as the commander. The revolutionization of our drama team is not enough; our ideology, life, and basic skills are not hard enough; especially, drama creation is still a weak link. We must study Chairman Mao's writings hard, establish lofty ambitions, and work hard, go deep into life, strengthen practice, and work diligently to show the new face of socialism, establish the uniqueness of the proletariat, and create good models. Creating good models is by no means an easy task. We must establish the view of creating for the revolution and strive to create new socialist literature and art.
    The achievements and shortcomings of the cultural and artistic work in our province clearly show that when we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely and thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction, our work will achieve one victory after another; when we deviate even slightly from Mao Zedong Thought in our work, we will produce shortcomings and even errors, which will bring incalculable losses to the Party's cause.
    Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in the Socialist Cultural Revolution, and unswervingly carry the Socialist Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    积极参加社会主义文化大革命
                  安徽省文化局　江枫
    《解放军报》社论《高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极参加社会主义文化大革命》是一篇十分重要的文章。社论运用毛主席思想，抓住了当前文艺工作上的一些根本性问题，极其深刻地总结了十六年来社会主义文化艺术工作的经验和教训。这些经验都是具有普遍意义的，不仅对部队文艺工作有着指导意义，而且也将指导着地方社会主义文化大革命运动的进一步发展。我看过这篇文章之后，受到了很大的教育。
    社论指出：“建国后的十几年来，文艺界存在着一条与毛泽东思想相对立的反党反社会主义的黑线。”和全国各地一样，我省文化战线上的阶级斗争也是非常尖锐和激烈的。解放以来，在上演革命现代戏方面曾出现过几次反复，戏剧舞台长期被帝王将相、才子佳人所统治；还上演过一些象《谢瑶环》这样的反党反社会主义的坏戏。这些现象的出现，主要是我们缺乏阶级和阶级斗争的观念，没有在戏剧工作中坚决贯彻执行毛主席的文艺方向，归根到底是我们自己的世界观还没有得到彻底的改造。过去我们对阶级斗争的认识是很不够的，现在我们必须对这个问题有充分的认识。仍以戏剧工作为例，从我省的情况来说，绝大部分文艺干部对待上演革命现代戏的态度是积极的，但是也还有些文艺干部并不是这样。有的人把大演革命现代戏当作“一阵风”，对传统戏恋恋不舍；还有人嘲笑革命现代戏是“白开水”；甚至有人借口“群众不欢迎”、“不上座”来反对上演革命现代戏。这些情况说明，要使革命现代戏巩固地占领舞台阵地还需要经过长期的、反复的斗争。所以我们必须突出政治，在文化革命中高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以阶级斗争为纲，坚决粉碎与毛泽东思想相对立的反党反社会主义的黑线。
    正如社论所指出的：“近三年来，社会主义的文化大革命，已经出现了新的形势”。我省的文化艺术工作，在省委的领导下，近几年来贯彻了党的八届十中全会的精神，开展了兴无灭资的斗争，从而出现了新的形势。这突出地表现在戏剧工作的革命化方面。在全国京剧会演的推动和影响下，我省革命现代戏的创作不论在数量和质量上都有了一定的发展和提高，现代戏已经占领了戏剧舞台，工农兵先进人物的艺术形象已经代替了帝王将相、才子佳人的形象。今年以来，在全省八千多名戏剧工作者中，就有七千多人参加了城乡社会主义教育运动和深入到农村、厂矿和部队中为工农兵服务，初步改变了过去脱离群众、脱离实际、脱离生活的“三脱离”状况。另一个表现是群众业余文化活动有了蓬勃的发展。目前，全省农村已较普遍地建立了农村文化室，群众业余文艺创作也有了很大的发展，出现了一些优秀的或比较优秀的作品。
    但是也必须看到，我省的文化艺术工作还跟不上形势发展的需要，贯彻党的文艺方向问题还没有彻底解决，其根本原因是没有突出政治，没有以毛泽东思想挂帅。我们戏剧队伍的革命化还不够；思想、生活、基本功都不够过硬；特别是戏剧创作还是薄弱的一环。我们一定要大学毛主席著作，树雄心，立壮志，深入生活，加强实践，扎扎实实地工作，标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，搞出好样板。要搞出好样板，决不是一件容易的事，我们一定要树立为革命而创作的观点，努力创造社会主义新文艺。
    我省文化艺术工作的成绩和缺点清楚地表明：当我们在高举毛主席思想伟大红旗，坚决彻底贯彻执行毛主席的文艺方向的时候，我们的工作就取得一个接连一个的胜利；当我们在工作中哪怕是稍稍离开毛主席思想，就会产生缺点乃至错误，就会给党的事业带来不可估量的损失。
    让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极参加社会主义文化大革命，坚定不移地把社会主义文化大革命进行到底！
