    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch from Washington: The United States government announced on the 17th that the United States and India had signed an agreement in New Delhi, stipulating that the United States would sell enriched uranium worth 100 million US dollars to India to help it develop atomic energy.
    The Johnson government signed this agreement with India after China successfully carried out its third nuclear explosion, with the aim of intensifying collusion with Indian expansionists against China. According to the Associated Press, the US Johnson government openly "sold" the atomic substance, enriched uranium, to India in order to promote India's "ambitious" atomic program. This action by the United States once again exposes the hypocrisy of its loudly touted so-called "prevention of nuclear proliferation." Indian expansionists, with Washington's assistance, are making a clamorous cry for the manufacture of atomic weapons.
    In announcing this agreement, the United States Atomic Energy Commission went to great lengths to emphasize its importance. The commission said that this was the first long-term agreement that the United States had signed to sell enriched uranium "outside of Western Europe," and that it was also the first time that the United States had sold enriched uranium to India. In order to conceal the anti-China nature of this agreement, the Atomic Energy Commission said that the enriched uranium sold by the United States would be used in India's so-called "peaceful use of atomic energy program." But the Associated Press admitted that many people in Indian political circles are strongly demanding that this program be used to "manufacture weapons."

### 约翰逊政府加紧勾结印度反华  将供应浓缩铀帮印推进原子计划

    约翰逊政府加紧勾结印度反华
    将供应浓缩铀帮印推进原子计划
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府十七日宣布，美国同印度在新德里签订了一个协定，规定美国向印度出售价值一亿美元的浓缩铀来帮助印度发展原子能。
    约翰逊政府在中国成功地进行了第三次核爆炸后同印度签订这个协定，目的是要加紧同印度扩张主义者勾结反华。据美联社报道，美国约翰逊政府公然把原子物质浓缩铀“卖给”印度是为了推进印度的“野心勃勃的”原子计划。美国的这个行动再次揭穿了它高唱入云的所谓“防止核扩散”的虚伪本质。印度扩张主义者正借华盛顿之助发出一片鼓吹制造原子武器的叫嚷声。
    美国原子能委员会在宣布这个协定时竭力强调协定的重要性。委员会说，这是美国“在西欧以外”签订的第一个长期出售浓缩铀的协定，也是美国第一次向印度出售浓缩铀。为了掩盖这个协定的反华性质，原子能委员会说什么美国出售的浓缩铀将用于印度的所谓“和平利用原子能计划”。但是美联社承认，印度政界许多人正在强烈要求使这个计划用来“制造武器”。
