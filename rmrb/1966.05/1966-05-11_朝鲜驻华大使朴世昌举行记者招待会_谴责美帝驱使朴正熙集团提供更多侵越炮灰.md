    Xinhua News Agency, May 10th – The Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, Park Se-chang, held a press conference this morning, strongly condemning US imperialism for driving its lackey, the Park Chung-hee clique, to send an increasing number of South Korean puppet troops to South Vietnam as cannon fodder.
    Ambassador Park Se-chang said that the Park Chung-hee clique, a running dog of US imperialism, recently sent a division-sized force of over 20,000 South Korean puppet troops to South Vietnam. In this way, the number of South Korean puppet troops who have been shamefully dragged to South Vietnam to die as cannon fodder will reach 50,000. The Ambassador said that on April 29th, the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued an appeal, calling on the South Korean people to launch a tenacious struggle against US imperialism's expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam and the dispatch of South Korean puppet troops to South Vietnam.
    Ambassador Park Se-chang condemned the US aggressors for intensifying the recruitment of more satellite state troops and puppet troops in order to save their shameful defeat in South Vietnam and extricate themselves from their predicament. He said that in implementing US imperialism's plan to increase the recruitment of mercenaries, the Park Chung-hee clique, against the will of the Korean people, is ahead of everyone else. This is not only an act of betrayal of the country and the nation, but also an extremely vicious criminal act against the Vietnamese people who are fighting for freedom, liberation, and independence, and against the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries. The Park Chung-hee clique is the most loyal running dog of US imperialism and a ferocious enemy of the national liberation movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Ambassador Park Se-chang said that the people of Korea and Vietnam are comrades-in-arms and brothers who are closely united in the struggle against the common enemy, US imperialism. The Korean people, no matter how difficult the environment, will fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people until the fraternal Vietnamese people completely eliminate the American aggressors.

    朝鲜驻华大使朴世昌举行记者招待会
    谴责美帝驱使朴正熙集团提供更多侵越炮灰
    新华社十日讯　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使朴世昌今天上午举行记者招待会，强烈谴责美帝国主义驱使它的走狗朴正熙集团把越来越多的南朝鲜伪军派到南越充当炮灰。
    朴世昌大使说，美帝国主义走狗朴正熙集团最近把一个师规模的两万多名南朝鲜伪军派到南越，这样，被可耻地拉到南越去送死的南朝鲜伪军数目，就要达到五万人了。大使说，四月二十九日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议发出呼吁，号召南朝鲜人民展开顽强斗争，反对美帝国主义扩大侵越战争和派南朝鲜伪军去南越。
    朴世昌大使谴责美国侵略者为了挽救它在南越的可耻惨败，摆脱困境，正在加紧搜罗更多的仆从国军队和伪军。他说，在执行美帝国主义的增募雇佣兵计划方面，朴正熙集团违背朝鲜人民的意愿，比任何人都走在前头。这不仅是出卖国家和民族的背叛行为，而且是对为争取自由、解放和独立而斗争的越南人民，对亚非拉各国人民的极其恶毒的犯罪行为。朴正熙集团是美帝国主义的最忠实的走狗，是亚非拉各国人民民族解放运动的凶恶敌人。朴世昌大使说，朝越两国人民是在反对共同的敌人美帝国主义的斗争中紧密团结起来的战友和兄弟。朝鲜人民不论在任何困难的环境中，也将同越南人民并肩战斗，直到兄弟的越南人民彻底消灭美国侵略者为止。
