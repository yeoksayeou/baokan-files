    Wu Han's "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" speak for and cheer on right-leaning opportunists. Before liberation, Wu Han served the Kuomintang reactionary faction of Chiang Kai-shek. After liberation, he persisted in his reactionary stance, opposing our Party and opposing socialism. During the period of temporary difficulties in our country, Wu Han, representing a handful of reactionaries, wrote many stinking articles, spreading poison everywhere and attacking the Party and socialism. Wu Han beat the gong above, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and demons and monsters beat the drums below. Together, they put on an ugly drama of anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist activity. In 1961, Wu Han wrote "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," advocating "land return." Wasn't Ma Chunlin, a rich peasant in our village, demanding that our family return his land? He told his son that the land on which our house was built was theirs, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack and settle scores, attempting to restore capitalism. Isn't Wu Han echoing such a gang of people? Chairman Mao said, "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary. Whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism is a counter-revolutionary." Wu Han stands on the side of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, speaking for them.
    The Party and Chairman Mao rescued us poor people from the pit of fire and from suffering. Before liberation, who among the poor and lower-middle peasants in our Xishankou Village could eat well and dress warmly? And who had bicycles and radios? But now, every household in our village eats its fill and dresses warmly. The whole village has more than two hundred bicycles and more than sixty radios. We have both electric lights and running water. For generations, my family worked long hours for the landlord, and the whole family of eleven had nothing to eat after a meal, no blankets to cover themselves, and no kang to sleep on. My uncle went up the mountain to collect firewood without shoes, wearing my grandmother's shoes. After liberation, we turned ourselves over politically and economically. All this was given to us by the Party and Chairman Mao. The Party and Chairman Mao are like our own parents. We are grateful beyond measure. We poor people will always follow the Party and Chairman Mao to make revolution. You Wu Han scold socialism, and we will defend socialism. Chairman Mao said, "All reactionary things, if you do not hit them, they will not fall." We poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely struggle against Wu Han, who is anti-Party and anti-people. We poor and lower-middle peasants have made great ambitions, resolutely listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, actively participate in this great Cultural Revolution, wipe out all the reactionaries and demons and monsters in the world, eradicate the poisonous weeds that are anti-Party and anti-socialist, and carry the Chinese revolution and the world revolution through to the end!

    吴晗是站在地富反坏右一边的
    昌平县西山口大队贫协委员、民兵排长　韩淑清
    吴晗写的《海瑞骂皇帝》和《海瑞罢官》，是代表右倾机会主义分子说话，为他们打气的。吴晗解放前为蒋介石国民党反动派服务，解放后仍然坚持反动的立场，反对我们的党，反对社会主义。在我国遇到暂时困难的时期，吴晗代表一小撮反动派写了许多臭文章到处放毒，向党向社会主义进攻。吴晗在上面敲锣，地富反坏、牛鬼蛇神就在下面打鼓，他们共同演出了一场反党反人民反社会主义的丑剧。吴晗一九六一年写了《海瑞罢官》宣传“退田”，我们村的富农分子马春林不就是要我们家退他的田吗？他告诉他儿子说我们家盖房子的地是他们的，伺机反攻倒算，企图复辟资本主义。吴晗不正是和这样一伙人一唱一和吗？毛主席说：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”吴晗是站在地富反坏右一边的，是替他们说话的。
    党和毛主席把我们穷人从火坑里，从苦难中救了出来。我们西山口村解放前贫下中农有谁吃得上、穿得上？又有谁有自行车和收音机？可现在我们村每户都吃得饱、穿得暖，全村有二百多辆自行车，六十多台收音机。又有电灯又有自来水。我们家从前几辈人给地主扛长活，全家十一口吃上顿没下顿，没被盖、没炕睡。我叔叔上山打柴没鞋穿，穿奶奶的鞋。解放以后，我们政治上翻了身，经济上也翻了身。这一切都是党和毛主席给我们的，党和毛主席就象我们的亲爹娘一样，我们感激还感激不过来。我们穷人要永远跟党和毛主席干革命。你吴晗骂社会主义，我们就要保卫社会主义。毛主席说：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”我们贫下中农坚决和反党反人民的吴晗作斗争。我们贫下中农立下了顶天立地的大志，坚决听党和毛主席的话，积极参加这场伟大的文化大革命，把世界上的一切反动派和牛鬼蛇神消灭干净，把反党反社会主义的毒草连根拔掉，将中国革命和世界革命进行到底！
