    Struggle Against Imperialist Revisionist "Blockade," Struggle Against Bourgeois "Authority" Framework
    Our Oxygen Cylinders Were Forged Through Struggle
    Meng Dehe, Worker Engineer of Shanghai Acid-Resistant Enamel Factory
    Since 1958, I and my comrades in the factory spent more than six years, constantly exploring and constantly reforming, and finally created oxygen cylinders that meet the quality requirements, filling a gap in China's industrial production field. The birth of domestically produced oxygen cylinders is the result of developing the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese working class and fighting against imperialism and revisionism. It is also the result of highlighting politics, despising bourgeois "authority," and breaking foreign conventions. Comrades in the factory all said that our oxygen cylinders were forged through the struggle between two ideologies and two lines, and should be called "Striving for Excellence Cylinders."

    Determined to Compete with Imperialism
    I was originally a sheet metal worker at Shanghai Eighteenth Sheet Metal Cooperative. In 1958, during the Great Leap Forward, I came to work at the local state-owned Shanghai Acid-Resistant Enamel Factory.

    At that time, the Acid-Resistant Enamel Factory had just switched from producing daily-use hardware enamel products to producing industrial enamel reaction pots. Initially, the production method was relatively backward, with a large amount of manual operation, heavy physical labor, and very low output. Later, encouraged by the Great Leap Forward, the comrades boldly innovated and improved tools, and the output increased significantly. At this time, a new contradiction appeared: the oxygen supply could not keep up. The factory needed fifty or sixty oxygen cylinders every day, but the gas refining plant only supplied us with four or five cylinders, and more than one hundred workers were often idled waiting for "gas." Why couldn't they give us more oxygen? After inquiring, it turned out that it wasn't that there was no oxygen, but that there were no cylinders to fill it after it was produced.

    Oxygen cylinders used to be imported from abroad, and American imperialism listed them as materials embargoed to China. Some other countries, knowing that we couldn't make them, took the opportunity to profiteer, demanding that we exchange ten tons of steel for one oxygen cylinder. We were furious when we heard this and decided to compete with imperialism and make them ourselves.

    At that time, none of us understood the technology of making oxygen cylinders, so we could only start with local methods, "copying the gourd according to the pattern." We used sixteen-pound and twenty-four-pound sledgehammers to hammer steel plates into cylinders and weld them together. If single-layered ones were not pressure-resistant, we made double-layered ones; if double-layered ones were still not safe enough, we added seven hoops. After more than three months and more than fifty failures, the first batch of oxygen cylinders was produced. This kind of oxygen cylinder, like a large thermos bottle, weighed one hundred and twenty-eight kilograms, more than twice as heavy as ordinary oxygen cylinders. Some people saw it and said it was too ugly. An engineer even criticized us for wasting state property and told us not to make them anymore. We thought that the emergence of any new thing must go through a process from low to high, from bad to good. Although our oxygen cylinders are now "ugly," they will eventually be beautiful. Since we have made them, we must be able to make them well. We decided to persevere and let the facts draw the conclusion.

    From then on, we spent more than six years and carried out five major reforms to continuously improve the structure and quality of oxygen cylinders.

    The Ambition of Chinese Workers Cannot be "Blockaded"
    The first reform began in 1959 after I attended the National Congress of Heroes. At the congress, a responsible comrade said: "Our Chinese working class has ambition. What foreigners have, we must have. What foreigners don't have, we must also have. This is our responsibility." These words touched my heart, and it was as if a burden had fallen on my shoulders. I made up my mind: I must improve the oxygen cylinders. After returning to the factory, with the support of the Party organization, I and my comrades started to reform the oxygen cylinders. However, at that time, a few people had different opinions and poured cold water on us, saying, "A sheet metal worker who knocks on foreign iron dustpans also wants to make oxygen cylinders. It's like a toad wanting to eat swan meat." An oxygen industry "authority" who had studied abroad said, "China will need at least another twenty years to make good quality oxygen cylinders." We were not discouraged by these words. I thought, making oxygen cylinders is for the needs of the country, not for any one person. The needs of the country are the responsibility of our workers. You say what you want, I'll do what I want. A few cold words will not shake our determination. After everyone's efforts, we made a native bundling machine to tighten the two layers of steel plates, reduce gaps, and increase the strength of the steel plates. We also removed the seven insurance hoops from the oxygen cylinder, making the cylinder more than ten kilograms lighter. This reform improved the oxygen cylinder a step further.

    However, after removing the seven hoops, the cylinder was still double-layered, costing a lot of materials and making it inconvenient to transport. We planned to carry out a second reform.

    At this time, the leadership wanted me to participate in a delegation to visit abroad. I held great hope and wanted to take this opportunity to learn some knowledge about manufacturing oxygen cylinders abroad. When we arrived in Kiev, the Soviet Union, we asked to visit the oxygen cylinder factory. They excused themselves, saying, "The visit plan here has already been arranged. You can visit Leningrad." When we arrived in Leningrad, we didn't expect them to shamelessly say, "The oxygen cylinder factory is confidential and cannot be visited." At this time, I was really furious. Their oxygen cylinder factory opened its doors to the British and Americans, but kept it "confidential" from us! Back at the hotel, I opened the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" that I had brought with me. Chairman Mao said, "We advocate self-reliance. We hope to have foreign aid, but we cannot rely on it. We rely on our own efforts, on the creativity of all our soldiers and civilians." Chairman Mao's words gave me endless strength. I thought: Foreigners have two hands, and we also have two hands; foreigners have a brain, and we also have a brain; foreigners can make it, why can't we? Besides, we are a country with 650 million people. Can't we make even one oxygen cylinder? Let imperialism embargo us, let revisionism blockade us. There's nothing great about it! We must be self-reliant and strive to make oxygen cylinders and show them!

    After returning to China, I told the comrades in the factory about the situation of running into snags abroad. Everyone was filled with anger and said, "They can blockade products and blockade technical data, but they can never blockade the ambition of our Chinese working class."

    Exploring Laws from Repeated Practice
    The second reform began. We spent several months making a "rolling machine" using local methods. At the same time, we used steel plates with higher strength to increase the pressure resistance of the cylinder body, and changed the double-layered cylinder to single-layered, reducing the weight by more than twenty kilograms.

    After the single-layered oxygen cylinder was successfully trial-produced, it was not ideal enough: a "foot ring" had to be installed at the bottom of the cylinder to make the cylinder body stand upright. I discussed with everyone again to carry out the third reform, planning to change the hemispherical bottom of the cylinder to a concave bottom and remove the "foot ring." At that time, we encountered a problem: What shape should the bottom of the cylinder be concave to, a flatter shape or a sharper shape? What ratio should be adopted between the thickness of the bottom of the cylinder and the thickness of the cylinder wall to withstand the same amount of pressure? To find this calculation formula, we needed knowledge of mechanics and advanced mathematics. It is said that there is no complete data abroad, and even if there is, they would not tell us. We thought, can't we do it without a calculation formula? Chairman Mao taught us: Theory comes from practice. The calculation formula did not fall from the sky. Without practice, where would the formula come from? We followed Chairman Mao's teachings and adopted the "stupid" method, testing them one by one, improving them each time we failed. After exploring for more than two months, we finally found a suitable shape and thickness ratio, made a concave bottom, and removed the "foot ring."

    After three reforms, the quality of oxygen cylinders has greatly improved. However, the bottle mouth and bottle bottom are still welded on, which is not only of poor quality but also wastes labor and materials. In response to this shortcoming, we proposed the topic of the fourth reform: using mechanical closing instead of welding.

    We visited everywhere, looked through materials in bookstores, and looked for closing methods. Once, when I was working in the cafeteria, I saw the cooks pinching buns, and their actions aroused my association: Isn't mechanical closing the same principle as pinching buns? But flour can be pinched by hand. What can be used to pinch a red-hot bottle blank? Later, I visited a machine forging factory and saw them using steam hammers to forge red-hot steel ingots, just like kneading dough. However, the problem came again. Our oxygen cylinders have welding seams. Can welded things be forged? We asked the relevant departments. Some experts coldly said to me: "Making oxygen cylinders is not as easy as making beer bottles. Forging welded oxygen cylinders has not been seen in world literature." What should we do? I studied "On Practice" with this question in mind. Chairman Mao's saying that "all true knowledge originates from direct experience" gave me great inspiration. I thought, the things in books are the summary of predecessors' experience. If we can't create anything that's not in books, then people wouldn't be able to live before there were books? We took the blanks of oxygen cylinders to a machine factory we were familiar with for testing. After six days of testing, we made three "closing" cylinders. The test results showed that one was good and two were bad. At that time, someone said: "After six days of making two bad and one good, it can be seen that good is accidental and bad is inevitable." I thought, didn't Chairman Mao often teach us to look at problems comprehensively? Since there is one good one, why can't we make them all good? Anything is difficult at the beginning. As long as we persevere, we will be able to find its laws. After analysis, we found that the good one was heated to a high temperature, and the operation was faster. It was still red after closing. The other two had lower temperatures and turned black as they were forged. We also found other reasons. In this way, everyone's confidence was boosted, and we were sure that mechanical closing was feasible. We made our own closing machine and continued the experiment. After hundreds of failures, we changed the mold more than fifty times and finally figured out the rules of high and low temperature, fast and slow speed, and light and heavy forging, making only good ones.

    By this time, the oxygen cylinder had been reformed four times. The weight had been reduced from 128 kilograms to 78 kilograms, the production process had been reduced by 24 steps compared to the original, the labor productivity had increased eight times, and the unit cost had been reduced by 62% compared to the original. At that time, the country urgently needed oxygen cylinders. The higher-level leadership organized an appraisal committee, inviting experts from all parties to participate in a comprehensive appraisal of our oxygen cylinders in order to include them in the national production plan as soon as possible.

    Daring to Despise Bourgeois "Authority"
    However, during the appraisal process, all kinds of foreign frameworks and foreign dogmas ran out. We launched a sharp struggle against bourgeois "authorities" who despise the masses and despise practice.

    One was about the bottom of the oxygen cylinder. At the appraisal meeting, a professor asked: "Do you have any data for this concave 'bottom' on the oxygen cylinder?"

    We said: "We can't provide the data for the time being, but from the actual use, the quality is not a problem."

    The professor still disagreed, saying: "Without data, how can we appraise the pressure resistance of the bottom?"

    We said: "As a complete technical data, there should be data. But now the country urgently needs oxygen cylinders. Why can't we make an appraisal based on actual use first, and then explore the data?"

    However, no matter what we said, the professor insisted that we provide data. Otherwise, he would not sign the appraisal report.

    I thought: We should have a scientific attitude in doing things. But what is a scientific attitude? Isn't it starting from reality and everything through experiment? Is it a scientific attitude to close your eyes to the facts and cling to the formula?

    Seeing that the debate was unresolved, everyone decided to conduct a burst test by sampling and let practice draw the conclusion.

    During the test, eleven oxygen cylinders were burst in a row, and the quality fully met the requirements. Facts speak louder than words, and the professor signed the appraisal report. Afterwards, he sent a group of college students to our factory to do graduation designs, specializing in calculating the formula for this concave "bottom." They did stress measurements, compiled a thick stack of data, and derived this formula. The results proved that the strength of our concave "bottom" exceeded the safety factor.

    Another issue that was debated fiercely at the appraisal meeting was whether the "closing" of the oxygen cylinder was feasible. An engineer, who was an expert in high-pressure containers, insisted that our oxygen cylinder "closing" (that is, the place where it is pinched together like kneading dough) had cracks, which did not meet the quality requirements of high-pressure containers. He also found many "bases" in books. Since the beginning of the appraisal meeting, no matter what issue was discussed, this person always shook his head and never nodded. As for what would work, he did not express a positive opinion. Now he came to shake his head about the "closing" issue again. When he shook his head, some people echoed him. We pointed out that this was not a crack, but a wrinkle formed by process processing. Everyone argued for a long time about the two nouns "crack" and "wrinkle", and finally admitted "wrinkle". However, the engineer still stubbornly believed that even if it was a "wrinkle", it was not acceptable. Wrinkles have slits, and slits are not safe. We said that this does not affect safety. American oxygen cylinders also have wrinkles. He still shook his head and did not believe us.

    What should we do? Let practice draw the conclusion. We compared our oxygen cylinders with American oxygen cylinders by metallographic analysis. The results showed that the wrinkles on American oxygen cylinders were deeper than the wrinkles on our cylinders. This comparison was very unfavorable to those who blindly believed in foreign frameworks. Wasn't it? He deeply believed in the deep wrinkles of American oxygen cylinders and regarded them as treasures. The wrinkles on our cylinders are shallower than those on American cylinders, but they shook their heads. What is the reason for this? Is it funny that even wrinkles are better in America? We presented the results of metallographic analysis and comparison at the appraisal meeting, presented the facts, and reasoned. The engineer saw that his worshipped American oxygen cylinders also had wrinkles and had nothing to say. Finally, he signed the appraisal report.

    After this appraisal, our oxygen cylinders were officially included in the national plan for production, supplying all parts of the country, filling a gap in China's industry, smashing the embargoes, blockades, and difficulties of imperialism and revisionism, and also breaking the shackles of foreign frameworks. The comrades in our factory proudly called it the "Striving for Excellence Cylinder."

    Resolutely Take Our Own Road
    Although oxygen cylinders have been officially produced, they are far from meeting the needs of all parties.

    In June 1963, I went to Beijing to attend an order meeting. Representatives from all over the country flocked to the hotel where we were staying, asking for more. They asked, "Why not produce more?" I repeatedly explained to them that the oxygen cylinders we are currently producing have to be welded together by electric welders. It is not a matter of a few months to train an electric welder. They suggested: "Then why not produce seamless oxygen cylinders? Seamless cylinders have good quality, high output, and low cost."

    I was very sad to hear the opinions and requirements of the representatives from all over the country: The country needs oxygen cylinders so much, and we have not fulfilled our responsibilities. I had long thought about manufacturing seamless oxygen cylinders. Their proposal strengthened my determination even more. On the train back to Shanghai, I envisioned a plan to manufacture seamless oxygen cylinders. Over the years, no matter where I visited, studied, or attended meetings, I recorded anything that I saw that was a little inspiring for the manufacture of seamless oxygen cylinders in my notebook. After returning to the factory, I took out my notebook, thought about it repeatedly, and reported it to the leadership. With the support of the factory leadership, I and several other comrades came up with a preliminary plan and were approved by the relevant leading departments for trial production.

    Although the oxygen cylinder has been reformed four times, it still has welding seams. Welding production is a backward process from the 1930s and is a low-level stage in the development of oxygen cylinders. This time, to change from seamed to seamless, we must carry out a thorough revolution in the process, which is indeed very difficult.

    At that time, we envisioned several plans. Copying foreign data would not only require a large investment and take a long time to see results, but the quality would not be very good. We must blaze a Chinese-style road to manufacture seamless oxygen cylinders. The speed must be fast, the money must be saved, the method must be "native," and the things must be good.

    We designed and manufactured seamless oxygen cylinders based on the factory's existing equipment and technical strength. We used old ones whenever possible, and we tried to substitute them whenever possible. We calculated horizontally and vertically, reducing the cost from more than one million to more than four hundred thousand, and finally to more than two hundred thousand, which was also approved by the higher authorities. Even so, there were still many difficulties and risks. At that time, I was also a little worried: What if there isn't enough money? What if the equipment is not useful? At this time, the leadership called on us to learn the revolutionary spirit of Daqing. Everyone said: The comrades of Daqing used revolutionary spirit to throw away the backward hat of "using foreign oil", and we must also use revolutionary spirit to throw away the backward hat of "welded cylinders." As long as we rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and everyone uses their brains to find solutions, the difficulties can always be overcome.

    The Infinite Power of "People's War"
    In order to fight a good "equipment" battle, the factory established an engineering battle headquarters and also sent a political instructor. The battle began, and everyone was very excited. I and my comrades worked day and night, spending about ten days drawing more than one hundred drawings, and at the same time preparing for construction. But at this time, the contradiction of insufficient labor appeared again. Originally, we estimated that it would take forty-eight people four or five months to complete, but at that time the factory could only draw sixteen people. What should we do with heavy tasks and few people? We studied Chairman Mao's thought of "concentrating forces to fight a war of annihilation." Everyone said: The method of concentrating forces to fight a war of annihilation is completely applicable to us. If we concentrate our forces to capture a piece of equipment, we can boost morale and ask the equipment for labor and output. However, the strength of sixteen people is ultimately limited. We also studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains". Everyone said: "The Foolish Old Man can move God, and we also have a 'God' around us. This 'God' is the masses." Everyone returned to their original groups to promote and move "God." When everyone heard that they were going to make seamless oxygen cylinder equipment, everyone became energetic and used the lunch and evening breaks to help us. The leadership also attached great importance to it and mobilized more than 90% of the factory's staff as "local troops" to cooperate with our main forces. The power of "People's War" is infinite. The frame above the furnace was originally planned for twenty-one days, but Comrade Xu Mingda and others completed it in only four days. The support of all the comrades in the factory encouraged us sixteen people, and everyone was more energetic and confident.

    In the process of manufacturing equipment, we overcame many technical difficulties.

    A four-meter-long cylinder is required for hydraulic equipment. In order to save costs, we plan to weld three sections of discarded old cylinders together for use. This cylinder has very high quality requirements, and the error at both ends cannot exceed thirty silks after processing. In order to ensure welding quality, we invited relevant technicians from outside the factory for consultation. At the meeting, some comrades put forward valuable opinions to us. I told this opinion to the comrades in the group and discussed it with everyone. Comrade Chen Chunyang came up with a method: heat the cylinder body to 250 degrees Celsius before welding, and then two people weld symmetrically. This method is good, but it is very difficult to operate. When burning the inner diameter, the welder has to drill into the cylinder and work continuously for more than ten hours. Communist Youth League member Xu Yuanpei rushed to shoulder the heavy responsibility and was the first to drill in. Other comrades cooperated and spent thirteen hours welding this cylinder. After the cylinder was processed, it was necessary to drill into the cylinder to wipe off the oil, which was a very difficult task, and young worker Shen Guangwen rushed to do it.

    Finally, we completed the processing task of this cylinder. After testing, the quality was very good, and the error was only twenty-three silks, which exceeded the design requirements.

    In this way, relying on people's consciousness, on people's enthusiasm, we spent more than four months overcoming the equipment barrier. After completion, the investment was nearly 90,000 yuan less than the original budget of more than 200,000 yuan. We used the extra money to buy some necessary spare parts, and in the end, we also had several thousand yuan to turn over to the state.

    Through this battle, not only was equipment produced, but the greater gain was the training of people. After the sixteen of us made the equipment, we dispersed to our original groups. Everyone continued to maintain the enthusiasm of the "battle" and worked actively. Not long ago, eleven of the sixteen were rated as "five-good", and three were rated as "model workers". Recently, two people have been promoted to technicians.

    On the eve of the 1964 National Day, we used the equipment we made to produce the first seamless oxygen cylinder, and then carried out experimental production to continue improving the equipment and process. Now the processing and production process of oxygen cylinders has been reduced by 59 steps compared to the original single-layer welding, the weight has been reduced to 59 kilograms, the cost has been reduced by 37.42%, and the quality is also very good.

    Everything Depends on Mao Zedong Thought
    We deeply realized that the oxygen cylinder from scratch, from low to high, is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the victory of the general line, and the victory of the Party's policy of striving for strength and self-reliance. It is the Party and Chairman Mao who have guided us in the direction of progress, and it is the Party and Chairman Mao who have given us courage, wisdom and strength. I remember very clearly: At the National Congress of Heroes in 1959, the central leaders awarded each of us a set of hardcover "Selected Works of Mao Zedong", a pen and a diary. How excited I was when I received Chairman Mao's book! Recalling the pre-liberation period, I herded cattle and sold fried dough sticks; after liberation, I became a worker and only did some things that should be done. The Party and the people gave me great honor. How should I do my job well in the future? At that time, I held the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" tightly in my arms and made up my mind: I must study Chairman Mao's works well, work hard, and use this pen to write down my achievements in this book and report to the Party. Over the years, I have read through Volumes 1 to 4 of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong", especially more than a dozen articles such as "Serve the People", "In Memory of Norman Bethune", "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains", "On Practice" and "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Attention to Working Methods". I have studied them repeatedly a dozen or twenty times. When I encountered difficulties in my work, I looked for direction and methods from Chairman Mao's works. After studying Chairman Mao's works, I felt that I became smarter and bolder.

    Last year, we also studied Chairman Mao's instructions on constantly summing up experience, which further inspired our fighting spirit. Everyone said: The revolution must be thorough, and we must strive for excellence to the end. At present, we are working on the sixth reform of oxygen cylinders, striving to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in a relatively short period of time.

    Some comrades said that we specialize in "turning tricks," and as soon as one thing is done, another comes. This is what I think: Chairman Mao taught us to constantly revolutionize and thoroughly revolutionize. If we engage in revolution, we can't just muddle through. As long as the country needs it, we must do it. From not being able to manufacture oxygen cylinders to being able to manufacture oxygen cylinders is just the first step in the Long March.

    Over the years, I have gone from an ordinary sheet metal worker to an engineer, joined the Party, and became a people's representative of the city. However, I feel that I have not done enough. The achievements I have made in the past are the result of the Party's education and cultivation and everyone's joint efforts. Without the Party and without the masses, I can't do anything well. In the future, I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of striving for strength and self-reliance in accordance with the requirements of the general line, do my job well, and contribute my strength to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

    同帝国主义修正主义“封锁”斗，同资产阶级“权威”框框斗
    我们的氧气瓶是斗出来的
    上海耐酸搪瓷厂工人工程师　孟德和
    从一九五八年以来，我和厂里的同志们花了六年多时间，不断摸索，不断改革，终于造出了质量符合要求的氧气瓶，在我国工业生产领域里填补了一项空白。国产氧气瓶的诞生，是发扬中国工人阶级革命志气，同帝国主义、修正主义进行斗争的结果，也是突出政治，藐视资产阶级“权威”，打破洋框框的结果。厂里同志们都说，我们的氧气瓶是在两种思想、两条路线的斗争中斗出来的，应当叫它“争气瓶”。
    决心同帝国主义较量较量
    我原来是上海十八白铁社的白铁工人，一九五八年大跃进的时候到地方国营上海耐酸搪瓷厂工作。
    那个时候，耐酸搪瓷厂刚刚从生产日用五金搪瓷产品转业生产工业搪瓷反应锅。起初生产方式比较落后，大量的是手工操作，重体力劳动，产量很低。后来在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，同志们大胆革新，改进工具，产量有了很大的提高。就在这个时候，出现了新的矛盾：氧气供应不上了。厂里每天需要五六十瓶氧气，但是炼气厂只供应我们四五瓶，经常有一百多个工人停工待“气”。为什么不能多给我们一些氧气呢？一了解，原来不是氧气没有，而是生产出来以后没有瓶装。
    氧气瓶过去一直靠国外进口，美帝国主义把它列为对我国禁运的物资。还有一些国家，晓得我们不会造，就乘机大敲竹杠，要我们用十吨钢材换一只氧气瓶。我们听了，气坏了，决心同帝国主义较量较量，自己动手来造。
    当时，大伙都不懂制造氧气瓶的技术，只能土法上马，来个“依葫芦画瓢”。我们用十六磅、二十四磅的大榔头，把钢板敲成个圆筒，用电焊焊起来。单层的不耐压，就搞双层的；双层的还怕不保险，又加上七道箍。经过三个多月，失败了五十多次，第一批氧气瓶搞出来了。这种氧气瓶，象只大型的热水瓶，重量有一百二十八公斤，比一般的氧气瓶重一倍多。有些人看了，说它太不象样子，有个工程师甚至批评我们浪费国家财产，叫我们不要再搞了。我们想，任何一件新生事物的产生，总要经过一个从低到高、从差到好的过程。我们的氧气瓶现在虽然“不象样”，将来总归会象样的。既然造出来了，就一定能够把它造好。我们决定坚持干下去，让事实来作结论。
    从此，花了六年多的时间，进行了五次重大的改革，使氧气瓶的结构不断完善，质量不断提高。
    中国工人的志气“封锁”不了
    第一次改革是一九五九年我出席了全国群英会后开始的。在群英会上，一位负责同志说：“我们中国工人阶级是有志气的。外国人有的我们要有，外国人没有的，我们也要有。这是我们的责任。”这几句话，说到了我的心里，也好象一副担子落到了我的肩上。我下了决心：一定要把氧气瓶搞上去。回到厂里，在党组织的支持下，我就和同志们一起动手改革氧气瓶。但是，当时有少数人有不同的看法，向我们吹冷风，说什么“敲敲洋铁畚箕的白铁匠也想搞氧气瓶，真是癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉”。有个在外国留过学的氧气工业“权威”人士说：“中国要造质量好的氧气瓶，至少再过二十年。”听到这些话，我们并不泄气。我想，搞氧气瓶是为了国家需要嘛，又不是为了那一个人。国家的需要，就是我们工人的责任。你讲你的，我做我的。几句冷言冷语，休想动摇我们的决心。大家经过努力，搞成了一台土包扎机，把两层钢板扎紧，减少空隙，增加了钢板的强度；又去掉了氧气瓶里的七道保险箍，使瓶子减轻了十多公斤。这么一改，氧气瓶比原来提高了一步。
    但是，七道箍去掉后，瓶子还是双层的，材料花得多，搬运又不便。我们就打算搞第二次改革。
    正在这个时候，领导上要我参加一个代表团出国访问。我抱着很大的希望，想乘这个机会到国外学一点制造氧气瓶的知识。我们到了苏联基辅，我们提出要参观氧气瓶工厂，他们推说：“这里的参观计划已经安排好了，你们到列宁格勒去参观吧。”到了列宁格勒，没有想到他们拉下了面皮讲：“氧气瓶厂是保密的，不能参观。”这时，我真气炸了。他们的氧气瓶厂敞开了大门给英国人美国人参观，却对我们“保密”！回到旅馆，我就把随身带去的《毛泽东选集》翻开来读。毛主席说：“我们是主张自力更生的。我们希望有外援，但是我们不能依赖它，我们依靠自己的努力，依靠全体军民的创造力。”毛主席的话给我增添了无穷的力量。我想：外国人有一双手，我们也有一双手，外国人有一个脑袋，我们也有一个脑袋，外国人能搞出来，我们为啥不能搞呢？何况我们是一个六亿五千万人口的国家，难道一只氧气瓶也搞不好吗？让帝国主义禁运吧，让修正主义封锁吧，没有什么了不起！我们一定要自力更生，争一口气搞出氧气瓶，给他们瞧瞧！
    回国后，我就把在国外碰钉子的情况告诉了厂里的同志，大家都憋了一肚皮气，说：“他们能够封锁产品、封锁技术资料，但是他们决不能封锁我们中国工人阶级的志气。”
    从反复实践中摸索规律
    第二次改革开始了。我们花了几个月，用土办法造了一台“轧圆机”，同时又采用强度较高的钢板，增加了瓶身的耐压强度，把双层瓶改成单层，重量又减轻了二十多公斤。
    单层氧气瓶试制成功后，还不够理想：要在瓶底装上一个“脚圈”，才能使瓶身直立起来。我又和大家商量搞第三次改革，打算把半球形的瓶底改为凹形底，去掉“脚圈”。当时碰到了一个难题：瓶底要凹成什么样的形状，平一点还是尖一点，瓶底的厚度和瓶壁的厚度要采取一个什么样的比例，才能经受同样大小的压力？求出这个计算公式，需要有力学与高等数学的知识，据说国外也没有完整的资料，就是有，他们也不会告诉我们。我们想，没有计算公式，我们就不能够搞吗？毛主席教导我们：理论是从实践中来的。计算公式也不是天上掉下来的，没有实践，那来什么公式？我们就按照毛主席的教导去做，采取“笨”办法一只一只试验，失败一次，改进一次。摸索了两个多月，终于找到了合适的形状和厚度比例，搞成了凹形底，去掉了“脚圈”。
    经过三次改革，氧气瓶的质量大大提高了一步，不过，瓶口和瓶底还是焊接上去的，不仅质量不好，而且费工费料。针对这个缺点，我们提出了第四次改革的课题：采用机械收口的办法来代替焊接。
    我们到处参观访问，跑书店翻资料，寻找收口方法。有一次，我到食堂劳动，看到炊事员在捏包子，他的动作引起了我的联想：机械收口不是同捏包子一样的道理吗？但是面粉可以用手捏，烧红的瓶坯用什么东西去捏呢？后来，参观了一家机锻厂，看到他们用汽锤来锻打烧红的钢锭，就象捏面团一样。可是，问题又来了，我们的氧气瓶有焊缝，焊接的东西是否可以锻造呢？我们就去请教有关部门。有的专家冷冷地对我说：“做氧气瓶不象做啤酒瓶那么便当。焊接的氧气瓶要锻造，这在世界文献里还没有看到过。”到底怎么办呢？我带着这个问题学习了《实践论》。毛主席说的“一切真知都是从直接经验发源的”这句话给了我很大启示。我想，书本上的东西是前人经验的总结，书本上没有的，我们就不能创造吗？如果样样事情都要等书本上有了再去做，那么在没有书本以前，人就不要过日子了吗？我们就拿了氧气瓶的坯子到一家熟悉的机器厂去试验。试了六天，搞出三只“收口”瓶，检验的结果是一只好，两只坏。当时有人说：“搞了六天两只坏，一只好，可见好是偶然的，坏是必然的。”我想，毛主席不是经常教导我们要全面地看问题吗？既然有一只好的，为什么不能做到只只好？任何事情开头总是难的，只要坚持下去一定能够摸索出它的规律。我们经过分析，发现好的一只温度烧得高，操作时速度也比较快，收好口以后还是红的；其他两只温度比较低，锻打到后来冷得发黑了。我们还查出了其他几个原因。这样一来，大家的信心就足了，肯定机械收口的办法是行得通的。我们就自己造了一台收口机，继续试验下去。经过上百次的失败，单是模具就改了五十多次，终于摸清了温度高低、速度快慢、锻打轻重的规律，做到了只只好。
    到这时候，氧气瓶已经改革了四次，重量从一百二十八公斤降低到七十八公斤，生产工序比原来减少了二十四道，劳动生产率提高了八倍，单位成本也比原来降低了百分之六十二。当时，国家迫切需要氧气瓶，上级领导部门就组织了一个鉴定委员会，请各方面的专家参加，对我们的氧气瓶进行全面的鉴定，以便早日列入国家生产计划。
    敢于藐视资产阶级“权威”
    可是，就在鉴定的过程中，各种洋框框、洋教条一起跑了出来。我们同轻视群众、轻视实践的资产阶级“权威”开展了一场尖锐的斗争。
    一个是关于氧气瓶的瓶底问题。在鉴定会上，有个教授问：“氧气瓶上的这只凹形‘底’，你们有没有数据？”
    我们说：“数据我们一时还拿不出，不过从实际使用的情况来看，质量没有问题。”
    教授仍然不同意，说：“没有数据，凭什么来鉴定瓶底的耐压强度呢？”
    我们说：“作为一份完整的技术资料，应当要有数据，但是现在国家急需氧气瓶，为什么不能先根据实际使用效果作出鉴定，然后再去探求数据呢？”
    但是，不管我们怎么说，那位教授一定要我们拿出数据，不然就不肯在鉴定书上签字。
    我心想：我们办事情是要有科学态度，但是，什么叫科学态度呢？难道不是从实际出发，一切通过试验吗？难道闭眼不看事实、死抱住公式不放就叫科学态度吗？
    看看争论不下，大家就决定抽样进行爆破试验，让实践来作出结论。
    试验的时候，一连爆破了十一只氧气瓶，质量完全符合要求。事实胜于雄辩，那位教授也就在鉴定书上签了字。事后他又派了一批大学生到我们厂里来搞毕业设计，专门计算这只凹形“底”的公式。他们做了应力测定，搞了厚厚一大叠数据，求出了这个公式。结果证明：我们这只凹形“底”的强度，超过了保险系数。
    鉴定会上争论得十分激烈的另一个问题，是氧气瓶的“收口”行不行。有个工程师，是高压容器的专家，他硬说我们的氧气瓶“收口”（就是象捏面团一样捏拢来的地方）有裂纹，不符合高压容器的质量要求，还找出了不少书本上的“根据”。从鉴定会开始以来，不论谈什么问题，这个人总是摇头，从来没有点过头，至于怎么样才行，他又不表示正面意见。现在他又来对“收口”问题摇头了。他一摇头，有的人也随声附和。我们就指出，这不是裂纹，是工艺加工形成的皱折。大家对“裂纹”“皱折”两个名词争了半天，最后算是承认了“皱折”。但是，那个工程师还是固执地认为，即使是“皱折”也不行，有皱折就有细缝，有细缝就不安全。我们说，这不影响安全，美国的氧气瓶也有皱折。他仍旧摇头，不相信我们的话。
    怎么办？还是让实践来下结论。我们把自己的氧气瓶同美国的氧气瓶进行金相分析，作了对比。结果发现：美国氧气瓶上的皱折，比我们瓶子的皱折还深。这个对比，对于迷信洋框框的人很不利。不是吗？美国氧气瓶皱折深，他倒深信不疑，看成宝贝；我们瓶子的皱折比美国的浅，他们反而摇头。这是什么道理呢？难道连皱折也是美国的好吗？真笑话！我们把金相分析和对比的结果在鉴定会上摊开来，摆事实，讲道理。那个工程师看到他崇拜的美国氧气瓶也有皱折，才无言可答，最后在鉴定书上签了字。
    经过这次鉴定，我们的氧气瓶正式列入国家计划进行生产，供应全国各地，填补了我国工业的一项缺门，粉碎了帝国主义、修正主义的禁运、封锁和刁难，也冲破了洋框框的束缚。我们全厂同志自豪地称它为“争气瓶”。
    坚决走我们自己的道路
    氧气瓶虽然正式生产了，但是远远不能满足各方面的需要。
    一九六三年六月，我到北京开订货会议。各地代表川流不息地到我们住的旅馆来，要求多给一点。他们问：“为什么不多生产一点？”我再三向他们解释，我们现在生产的氧气瓶，是硬碰硬要电焊工焊起来的，培养一个电焊工不是几个月的问题。他们就提出意见：“那么为什么不生产无缝的氧气瓶呢？无缝瓶质量好，产量高，成本低。”
    听了各地代表的意见和要求，我非常难过：国家这样需要氧气瓶，我们没有尽到责任。制造无缝氧气瓶，我老早就想过了。他们一提出，更加强了我的决心。在回上海的火车上，我就设想制造无缝氧气瓶的方案。这几年来，我不论在那个地方参观、学习、开会，凡是看到对制造无缝氧气瓶有一点启发的东西，都把它记在笔记本上。回厂后，我把笔记本翻出来，反复思考，并向领导上作了汇报。在厂领导的支持下，我和其他几个同志搞出了一个初步计划，并经有关领导部门批准试制。
    氧气瓶虽然改了四次，但改来改去还是有焊缝的。焊接生产，是三十年代的落后工艺，是氧气瓶发展过程中的低级阶段。这一次要把有缝改为无缝，必须从工艺上来一个彻底革命，困难确实很大。
    当时，我们设想过好几个方案。照搬外国的资料吧，不但投资大，见效慢，而且质量也并不怎么好。我们要闯出一条中国式的制造无缝氧气瓶的道路，速度要快，钞票要省，办法是“土”的，东西要好。
    我们就根据厂里现有的设备和技术力量，来设计制造无缝氧气瓶。能用旧的，就用旧的，能代用的，就想办法代用。我们横算竖算，从一百多万减少到四十多万，最后减少到二十几万，上级也批准了。算是这样算了，但困难还是不少，还是有风险的。当时我也有点担心：钞票不够怎么办？设备搞出来不好用怎么办？这时，领导上号召我们学习大庆的革命精神。大家说：大庆的同志用革命精神掼掉“用洋油”的落后帽子，我们也要用革命精神掼掉“焊缝瓶”的落后帽子。只要依靠群众，发动群众，大家动脑筋想办法，困难总归可以克服的。
    “人民战争”的无穷力量
    为了打好“设备”仗，厂部成立了工程会战指挥部，还派来了一位政治指导员。战斗开始了，大家都很兴奋。我和同志们不分日夜地干，用了十天左右的时间画了一百多张图纸，同时作好了施工准备工作。但这时候又出现了劳动力不够的矛盾。本来我们算下来要四十八个人搞四五个月才能完工，但是当时厂里只能抽出十六个人。任务重、人手少，怎么办呢？我们就学习了毛主席的“集中力量打歼灭战”的思想。大家说：集中力量打歼灭战的办法，对我们完全适用。如果我们集中力量拿下了一台设备，就可以鼓舞士气，就可以向设备要劳动力，要产量。但是，十六个人的力量终究是有限的。我们又学习了《愚公移山》，大家讲：“愚公能感动上帝，我们周围也有‘上帝’，这‘上帝’就是群众。”大家就回到原来的小组去宣传，去感动“上帝”。大伙一听要搞无缝氧气瓶设备，个个来劲，纷纷利用中午、晚上的休息时间帮我们一块干。领导上也很重视，动员了全厂百分之九十以上的职工作为“地方部队”，配合我们主力部队作战。“人民战争”的力量是无穷的。炉子上面的架子，原来计划要二十一天，徐明达等同志只用了四天功夫就完成了。全厂同志的支持，鼓舞了我们十六个人，大家的劲头更加高了，信心更加足了。
    在制造设备的过程中，我们攻下许多技术上的难关。
    液压设备中要用一只四米长的汽缸。为了节省费用，我们打算用三节报废的旧汽缸焊接起来代用。这只汽缸质量要求很高，加工后两头的误差不能超过三十丝。为了保证焊接质量，我们请了厂外有关技术人员来会诊，会上，有的同志对我们提出了宝贵的意见。我把这个意见告诉了小组同志，和大家一起商量。陈春阳同志想出一个办法，就是在烧电焊之前先把缸体加热到摄氏二百五十度，然后两个人对称焊接。这个办法好是好，但操作起来十分艰苦，在烧内径的时候，电焊工人要钻到汽缸里连续工作十几个小时。共青团员须元培抢挑重担，第一个钻进去，其他同志通力协作，结果花了十三个钟头，把这只汽缸焊接好了。在汽缸车加工以后，要钻进汽缸里去揩清油腻，这是一个很困难的任务，青年工人沈光文又抢着去干。
    最后我们终于完成了这只汽缸的加工任务，经过检验，质量很好，误差只有二十三丝，超过了设计要求。
    我们就是这样，靠人的觉悟，靠人的干劲，花了四个多月时间攻下了设备关。完工后，投资比原来预算的二十多万元还省了将近九万元。我们把多下来的钱搞了一些必要的备件，最后还多了几千元上缴给国家。
    经过这场战斗，不但造出了设备，更大的收获是锻炼了人。我们这十六个人，设备搞好后就分散到原来的小组，大家继续保持“会战”时的劲头，积极工作。不久前，十六个人当中有十一个评上了“五好”，三个评为“标兵”。最近，有两个人还被提拔为技术员。
    一九六四年国庆节前夕，我们用自己制造的设备生产出第一只无缝氧气瓶，接着进行试验性生产，继续改进设备和工艺。现在氧气瓶的加工生产工序，比原来单层焊接又减少了五十九道，重量降低到五十九公斤，成本又降低了百分之三十七点四二，质量也很好。
    一切都是靠毛泽东思想
    我们深深体会到：氧气瓶从无到有，从低到高，这是毛泽东思想的胜利，总路线的胜利，党的奋发图强、自力更生方针的胜利。是党和毛主席给我们指引了前进的方向，是党和毛主席给了我们勇气、智慧和力量。我还记得很清楚：在一九五九年的全国群英会上，中央领导同志奖给了我们每人一套精装的《毛泽东选集》、一支钢笔和一本日记簿。当我拿到毛主席的书的时候，心里有多激动呵！回想起解放前，我放过牛，卖过大饼油条；解放后当了工人，只是做了一些应该做的事情，党和人民就给了我很大的荣誉，今后我应该怎么样做好工作呢？当时，我把《毛泽东选集》紧紧抱在自己怀里，立下了决心：一定要好好学习毛主席著作，努力工作，用这支钢笔，在这本簿子上写下自己的成绩向党汇报。几年来，我通读了《毛泽东选集》一到四卷，特别是《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》《实践论》和《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》等十几篇文章，我反复学习了一二十遍。当工作碰到困难的时候，我就从毛主席著作当中找方向、找办法。学习了毛主席著作后，我觉得人也变得聪明了，胆子也变得大了。
    去年，我们又学习了毛主席关于不断总结经验的指示，进一步激励了斗志。大家表示：革命要彻底，争气一定要争到底。目前，我们正在着手对氧气瓶进行第六次改革，力争在比较短的时间内，赶上和超过世界先进水平。
    有些同志讲我们专门“翻花样”，一桩事情刚刚做好又来一桩。我是这样想的：毛主席教导我们要不断革命、彻底革命，搞革命就不能日子混得过去就算了。只要国家需要，我们一定要搞。从不会制造氧气瓶到能够制造氧气瓶，只不过是万里长征走了第一步。
    几年来，我从一个普通的白铁工成为一个工程师，又入了党，当上了市的人民代表。但是，我自己觉得做得很不够。过去做出的一些成绩，都是党的教育培养和大家共同努力的结果。离开了党，离开了群众，我什么事情也做不好。今后我一定坚决听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事，根据总路线的要求，继续发扬奋发图强、自力更生的革命精神，搞好自己的工作，为中国革命和世界革命贡献自己的力量。
